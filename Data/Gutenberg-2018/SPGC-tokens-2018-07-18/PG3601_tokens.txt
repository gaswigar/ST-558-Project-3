with
deep
affection
i
confess
that
i
do
not
see
why
the
very
existence
of
an
invisible
world
may
not
in
part
depend
on
the
personal
response
which
any
of
us
may
make
to
the
religious
appeal
god
himself
in
short
may
draw
vital
strength
and
increase
of
very
being
from
our
fidelity
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
know
what
the
sweat
and
blood
and
tragedy
of
this
life
mean
if
they
mean
anything
short
of
this
if
this
life
be
not
a
real
fight
in
which
something
is
eternally
gained
for
the
universe
by
success
it
is
no
better
than
a
game
of
private
theatricals
from
which
one
may
withdraw
at
will
but
it
feels
like
a
real
fight
as
if
there
were
something
really
wild
in
the
universe
which
we
with
all
our
idealities
and
faithlessness
are
needed
to
redeem
and
first
of
all
to
redeem
our
own
hearts
from
atheisms

fears

death
of
the
rev
charles
cardinal
death
leapt
upon
the
rev
charles
cardinal
rector
of
dreots
in
south
glebeshire
at
the
moment
that
he
bent
down
towards
the
second
long
drawer
of
his
he
bent
down
to
find
a
clean
collar
it
is
in
its
way
a
symbol
of
his
whole
life
that
death
claimed
him
before
he
could
find
one
at
one
moment
his
mind
was
intent
upon
his
collar
at
the
next
he
was
stricken
with
a
wild
surmise
a
terror
that
even
at
that
instant
he
would
persuade
himself
was
exaggerated
he
saw
before
his
clouding
eyes
a
black
pit
a
strong
hand
striking
him
in
the
middle
of
his
back
flung
him
contemptuously
forward
into
it
a
gasping
cry
of
protest
and
all
was
over
had
time
been
permitted
him
he
would
have
stretched
out
a
hand
towards
the
shabby
black
box
that
true
to
all
miserly
convention
occupied
the
space
beneath
his
bed
time
was
not
allowed
him
he
might
take
with
him
into
the
darkness
neither
money
nor
clean
clothing
he
had
been
told
on
many
occasions
about
his
heart
that
he
must
not
excite
nor
strain
it
he
allowed
that
to
pass
as
he
allowed
many
other
things
because
his
imagination
was
fixed
upon
one
ambition
and
one
alone
he
had
made
upon
this
last
and
fatal
occasion
haste
to
find
his
collar
because
the
bell
had
begun
its
evensong
clatter
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
late
the
bell
continued
to
ring
and
he
lay
his
broad
widespread
length
upon
the
floor
he
was
a
large
and
dirty
man
the
shabby
old
house
was
occupied
with
its
customary
life
down
in
the
kitchen
ellen
the
cook
was
snatching
a
moment
from
her
labours
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
she
sat
at
the
deal
table
her
full
bosom
pressed
by
the
boards
her
saucer
balanced
on
her
hand
she
blew
with
little
heaving
pants
at
her
tea
to
cool
it
her
thoughts
were
with
a
new
hat
and
some
red
roses
with
which
she
would
trim
it
she
looked
out
with
little
shivers
of
content
at
the
falling
winter
dusk
anne
the
scoured
the
pans
her
bony
frame
seemed
to
rattle
as
she
scrubbed
with
her
red
hands
she
was
happy
because
she
was
hungry
and
there
would
be
a
pudding
for
dinner
she
sang
to
herself
as
she
worked
upstairs
in
the
maggie
cardinal
the
only
child
of
the
rev
charles
sat
sewing
she
hoard
the
jangling
of
the
church
hell
she
heard
also
suddenly
with
a
surprise
that
made
her
heart
beat
for
a
moment
with
furious
leaps
a
tapping
on
the
then
directly
after
that
she
fancied
that
there
came
from
her
father
room
above
the
thud
of
some
sudden
fall
or
collapse
she
listened
the
bell
swallowed
all
other
noise
she
thought
that
she
had
been
mistaken
but
the
tapping
at
the
window
began
again
now
insistent
the
church
bell
suddenly
stopped
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
one
could
hear
the
slight
creak
of
some
bough
driven
by
the
against
the
wall
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
and
where
the
curve
of
the
hill
fell
away
the
sky
was
faintly
yellow
some
cold
stars
like
points
of
ice
pierced
the
higher
blue
carelessly
as
though
with
studied
indifference
flakes
of
snow
fell
turning
grey
against
the
windows
then
vanishing
utterly
maggie
going
to
the
window
saw
a
dark
shapeless
figure
beyond
the
glass
for
an
instant
she
was
invaded
by
the
terror
of
her
surprised
loneliness
then
she
remembered
her
father
and
the
warm
kitchen
then
realised
that
this
figure
in
the
dark
must
be
her
uncle
mathew
she
went
out
into
the
hall
pushed
back
the
stiff
clumsy
handle
of
the
door
and
stepped
on
to
the
gravel
path
she
called
out
laughing
come
in
you
frightened
me
out
of
my
life
as
he
came
towards
her
she
felt
the
mingled
kindness
and
irritation
that
he
always
roused
in
her
he
stood
in
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
a
fat
man
a
soft
hat
pushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
a
bag
in
one
hand
his
face
was
weak
and
his
eyes
had
once
been
fine
but
now
they
were
dim
and
blurred
there
were
dimples
in
his
fat
cheeks
he
wore
on
his
upper
lip
a
ragged
and
untidy
moustache
and
he
had
two
indeterminate
chins
his
expression
was
mild
kindly
now
a
little
ashamed
now
greatly
indignant
it
was
a
pity
as
he
often
said
that
he
had
not
more
control
over
his
feelings
maggie
saw
at
once
that
he
was
as
usual
a
little
drunk
well
she
said
come
in
uncle
father
is
in
church
i
think
she
added
uncle
mathew
stepped
with
careful
deliberation
into
the
hall
put
his
bag
on
a
chair
and
began
a
long
rambling
explanation
you
know
maggie
that
i
would
have
sent
you
a
post
card
if
i
had
had
an
idea
but
upon
my
soul
there
i
was
suddenly
in
drymouth
on
important
business
i
thought
to
myself
on
waking
this
morning
i
took
a
room
at
the
tuns
there
are
charles
and
maggie
whom
i
have
seen
for
an
age
i
have
sent
you
a
telegram
but
the
truth
is
my
dear
that
i
did
want
to
spend
a
penny
more
than
i
must
things
have
been
going
so
well
with
me
of
late
it
a
long
story
i
want
your
father
advice
i
had
the
worst
of
luck
and
i
could
tell
you
one
or
two
things
that
would
simply
surprise
you
but
anyway
there
it
is
just
for
a
night
i
sure
you
wo
mind
or
the
day
after
i
must
be
back
in
town
or
this
thing
will
slip
right
through
my
fingers
these
days
one
must
be
awake
or
one
simply
nowhere
he
paused
and
nodded
his
head
very
solemnly
at
her
looking
as
he
did
so
serious
and
important
it
was
thus
that
he
always
appeared
for
one
night
only
but
staying
for
weeks
and
weeks
in
spite
of
the
indignant
protests
of
his
brother
charles
who
had
never
liked
him
and
grudged
the
expense
of
his
visits
maggie
herself
took
his
appearance
as
she
did
everything
else
in
her
life
with
philosophy
she
had
an
affection
for
her
uncle
she
wished
that
he
did
not
drink
so
much
but
had
he
made
a
success
of
life
she
would
not
have
cared
for
him
as
she
did
after
all
every
one
had
their
weaknesses
she
steered
her
uncle
into
the
and
placed
him
on
a
chair
beside
the
fire
in
all
his
movements
he
attempted
restraints
and
dignity
because
he
knew
that
he
was
drunk
but
hoped
that
his
niece
in
spite
of
her
long
experience
of
him
would
not
perceive
it
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
she
did
perceive
it
and
would
perhaps
scold
him
about
it
this
made
him
a
little
indignant
because
after
all
he
had
only
taken
the
tiniest
drop
one
drop
at
drymouth
another
at
liskane
station
and
another
at
the
hearty
cow
at
clinton
mary
just
before
his
start
on
his
cold
lonely
walk
to
dreot
he
hoped
that
he
would
prevent
her
criticism
by
his
easy
pleasant
talk
so
on
he
chattered
she
sat
down
near
him
and
continuing
to
sew
smiled
at
him
wondered
what
there
was
for
dinner
and
the
kind
of
mood
that
her
father
would
be
in
when
he
found
his
dear
brother
here
maggie
cardinal
at
the
time
was
nineteen
years
of
age
she
was
neither
handsome
nor
distinguished
plain
indeed
although
her
mild
eyes
had
in
their
light
a
quality
of
vitality
and
interest
that
gave
her
personality
her
figure
was
thick
and
square
she
would
be
probably
stout
one
day
she
moved
like
a
man
behind
the
mildness
of
her
eyes
there
was
much
character
and
resolve
in
her
carriage
in
the
strong
neck
the
firm
breasts
the
mouth
resolute
and
determined
she
had
now
the
fine
expectation
of
her
youth
her
health
her
optimism
her
ignorance
of
the
world
when
these
things
left
her
she
would
perhaps
be
a
yet
plainer
woman
in
her
dress
she
was
not
clever
her
clothes
were
ugly
with
the
coarse
drab
grey
of
their
material
and
the
unskilful
workmanship
that
had
created
them
and
yet
there
would
be
some
souls
who
would
see
in
her
health
her
youth
the
kind
sympathy
of
her
eyes
and
mouth
the
high
nobility
of
her
forehead
from
which
her
hair
was
brushed
back
an
attraction
that
might
hold
them
more
deeply
than
an
obvious
beauty
uncle
mathew
although
he
was
a
silly
man
was
one
of
these
perceptive
souls
and
had
he
not
been
compelled
by
his
circumstances
to
think
continually
about
himself
would
have
loved
his
niece
very
dearly
as
it
was
he
thought
her
a
fine
girl
when
he
thought
of
her
at
all
and
wished
her
more
success
in
life
than
her
poor
old
uncle
had
had
he
looked
at
her
now
across
the
fireplace
with
satisfaction
she
was
something
sure
and
pleasant
in
a
world
that
swayed
and
was
uncertain
he
was
drunk
enough
to
feel
happy
so
long
as
he
was
not
scolded
he
dreaded
the
moment
when
his
brother
charles
would
appear
and
he
strove
to
arrange
in
his
mind
the
wise
and
unanswerable
word
with
which
he
would
defend
himself
but
his
thoughts
slipped
just
as
the
firelight
slipped
and
the
floors
with
the
old
threadbare
carpet
then
suddenly
the
hall
door
opened
with
a
jangle
there
were
steps
in
the
hall
and
old
timmie
carthewe
the
sexton
appeared
in
the
he
had
a
goat
face
and
a
body
like
a
hairpin
rector
not
been
to
service
he
said
there
miss
dunnett
and
giles
and
the
two
miss
backshaws
i
feared
he
forgotten
maggie
started
up
instantly
to
her
mind
came
the
memory
of
that
fancied
sound
from
her
father
room
she
listened
now
her
head
raised
and
the
two
men
their
eyes
bleared
but
their
noses
sniffing
as
though
they
were
dogs
listened
also
there
were
certain
sounds
clocks
ticking
the
bough
scraping
on
the
wall
a
cart
echo
on
the
frozen
road
the
maid
singing
far
in
the
depths
of
the
house
maggie
nodded
her
head
i
go
and
see
she
said
she
went
into
the
hall
and
stood
again
listening
then
she
called
father
father
but
there
was
no
answer
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
been
frightened
by
anything
and
she
was
not
frightened
now
nevertheless
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
she
looked
behind
her
to
see
whether
any
one
followed
her
she
called
again
father
then
went
to
his
door
pushed
it
open
and
looked
in
the
room
was
cold
with
a
faint
scent
of
tallow
candle
and
damp
in
the
twilight
she
saw
her
father
body
lying
like
a
shadow
stretched
right
across
the
floor
with
the
grey
dirty
fingers
of
one
hand
clenched
after
that
events
followed
swiftly
maggie
herself
had
no
time
nor
opportunity
for
any
personal
emotion
save
a
dumb
kind
of
wonder
that
she
did
not
feel
more
but
she
saw
all
through
a
glass
darkly
there
had
been
first
that
moment
when
the
sexton
and
uncle
mathew
still
like
dogs
sniffing
had
peered
with
their
eyes
through
her
father
door
then
there
had
been
the
summoning
of
bubbage
from
the
village
his
his
continual
i
warned
him
i
warned
him
he
say
i
did
warn
him
and
then
very
dim
and
far
away
thank
you
miss
cardinal
i
think
i
will
have
a
glass
if
you
do
mind
there
had
been
cook
crying
in
the
kitchen
her
red
roses
intended
for
sunday
must
now
be
postponed
and
the
maid
sniffing
in
the
hall
there
had
been
uncle
mathew
muddled
and
confused
but
clinging
to
his
one
idea
that
the
best
thing
you
can
do
my
dear
is
to
send
for
your
aunt
anne
there
had
been
the
telegram
dispatched
to
aunt
anne
and
then
after
that
the
house
had
seemed
quite
filled
with
people
ladies
who
had
wished
to
know
whether
they
could
help
her
in
any
way
and
even
the
village
butcher
who
was
there
for
no
reason
but
stood
in
the
hall
rubbing
his
hands
on
his
thighs
and
sniffing
all
these
persons
maggie
surveyed
through
a
mist
she
was
calm
and
collected
and
empty
of
all
personality
maggie
cardinal
the
real
maggie
cardinal
was
away
on
a
visit
somewhere
and
would
not
be
back
for
a
time
or
two
then
suddenly
as
the
house
had
filled
so
suddenly
it
emptied
maggie
found
that
she
was
desperately
tired
she
went
to
bed
and
slept
instantly
on
waking
next
morning
she
was
aware
that
it
was
a
most
beautiful
winter
day
and
that
there
was
something
strange
in
the
air
there
came
to
her
then
very
slowly
a
sense
of
her
father
she
saw
him
on
the
one
side
persistently
as
she
had
found
him
in
his
room
strange
shapeless
with
a
crumpled
face
and
a
dirty
beard
that
seemed
to
be
more
dead
than
the
rest
of
him
on
the
other
side
she
saw
him
as
she
had
found
him
in
the
first
days
of
her
consciousness
of
the
world
he
must
have
been
jolly
then
large
and
strong
laughing
often
tossing
her
she
remembered
to
the
ceiling
his
beard
and
his
eyebrows
bushy
and
overhanging
once
that
vigour
afterwards
this
horror
she
shook
away
from
her
last
vision
of
him
but
it
returned
again
and
again
hanging
about
her
over
her
shoulder
like
an
messenger
and
all
the
life
between
seemed
to
be
suddenly
wiped
away
as
a
sponge
wipes
figures
off
a
slate
after
the
death
of
her
mother
she
had
made
the
best
of
her
circumstances
there
had
been
many
days
when
life
had
been
unpleasant
and
in
the
last
year
as
his
miserliness
had
grown
upon
him
his
at
any
fancied
extravagance
had
been
almost
that
of
an
insane
man
but
maggie
knew
very
little
of
the
affairs
of
other
men
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
one
had
some
disadvantage
with
which
to
grapple
she
did
not
pretend
to
care
for
her
father
she
was
very
lonely
because
the
villagers
hated
him
but
she
had
always
made
the
best
of
everything
because
she
had
never
had
an
intimate
friend
to
tell
her
that
that
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
it
was
indeed
marvellous
how
isolated
her
life
had
been
she
knew
simply
nothing
about
the
world
at
all
she
could
not
pretend
that
she
was
sorry
that
her
father
had
died
and
yet
she
missed
him
because
she
knew
very
well
that
she
was
now
no
business
that
she
was
utterly
and
absolutely
alone
in
the
universe
it
might
be
said
that
she
could
not
be
utterly
alone
when
she
had
her
uncle
mathew
but
although
she
was
ignorant
of
life
she
knew
her
uncle
mathew
nevertheless
he
did
something
to
remove
the
sharp
alarm
of
her
sudden
isolation
upon
the
day
after
her
father
death
he
was
at
his
very
best
his
kindest
and
most
gentle
he
was
rather
pathetic
having
drunk
nothing
out
of
respect
to
the
occasion
he
felt
somewhere
deep
down
in
him
a
persistent
exaltation
that
his
brother
charles
was
dead
but
he
knew
that
it
was
not
decent
to
allow
this
feeling
to
conquer
him
and
he
was
truly
anxious
to
protect
and
comfort
his
niece
so
well
as
he
was
able
early
in
the
afternoon
he
suggested
that
they
should
go
for
a
walk
everything
necessary
had
been
done
an
answer
to
their
telegram
had
been
received
from
his
sister
anne
that
she
could
not
leave
london
until
that
night
but
would
arrive
at
clinton
mary
station
at
nine
morning
that
would
be
in
good
time
for
the
funeral
a
ceremony
that
was
to
be
conducted
by
the
rev
tom
trefusis
the
sporting
vicar
of
cator
hill
the
neighbouring
parish
the
house
now
was
empty
and
silent
they
must
escape
from
that
figure
now
decent
clean
and
solemn
lying
upon
the
bed
upstairs
mathew
took
his
niece
by
the
hand
and
said
my
dear
a
little
fresh
air
is
the
thing
for
both
of
us
it
will
cheer
you
up
so
they
went
out
for
a
walk
together
maggie
knew
with
a
deep
and
intimate
experience
every
lane
and
road
within
twenty
miles
radius
of
dreot
there
was
the
that
went
through
gator
hill
to
clinton
and
then
to
polwint
here
were
the
paths
across
the
fields
to
lucent
the
lanes
that
led
to
the
valley
of
the
lisp
all
the
paths
like
spiders
webs
through
rothin
wood
from
whose
curve
you
could
see
polchester
grey
and
white
with
its
roofs
and
the
spires
of
the
cathedral
thrusting
like
pointing
fingers
into
the
heaven
it
was
the
polchester
view
that
she
chose
but
as
they
started
through
the
deep
lanes
down
the
dreot
hill
she
was
startled
and
disturbed
by
the
strange
aspect
which
everything
wore
to
her
she
had
not
as
yet
realised
the
great
shock
her
father
death
had
been
she
was
exhausted
spiritually
and
physically
in
spite
of
the
deep
sleep
of
the
night
before
the
form
and
shape
of
the
world
was
a
little
strained
and
fantastic
the
colours
uncertain
now
vivid
now
vanishing
the
familiar
trees
hedges
clouds
screens
as
it
were
concealing
some
scene
that
was
being
played
behind
them
but
beyond
and
above
all
other
sensations
she
was
conscious
of
her
liberty
she
struggled
against
this
she
should
be
conscious
before
everything
of
her
father
loss
but
she
was
not
it
meant
to
her
at
present
not
so
much
the
loss
of
a
familiar
figure
as
the
sudden
juggling
by
an
outside
future
of
all
the
regular
incidents
and
scenes
of
her
daily
life
as
at
a
pantomime
one
sees
by
a
transformation
of
the
scenery
the
tables
the
chairs
and
pictures
the
walls
dance
to
an
unexpected
jig
she
was
free
free
free
alone
but
free
what
form
her
life
would
take
she
did
not
know
what
troubles
and
sorrows
in
the
future
there
might
be
she
did
not
care
her
life
would
begin
although
unsentimental
she
was
and
affectionate
but
now
for
many
years
her
life
with
her
father
had
been
a
daily
battle
of
anger
and
bitterness
it
may
be
that
once
he
had
loved
her
that
had
been
in
those
days
when
she
was
not
old
enough
to
love
him
since
she
had
known
him
he
had
loved
only
money
she
would
have
loved
him
had
he
allowed
her
and
because
he
did
not
she
bore
him
no
grudge
she
had
always
regarded
her
life
sterile
and
unprofitable
as
it
was
with
humour
until
now
when
like
a
discarded
dress
it
had
slipped
behind
her
she
did
not
see
it
even
now
with
bitterness
there
was
no
bitterness
for
anything
in
her
character
as
they
walked
uncle
mathew
was
considering
her
for
the
first
time
on
the
other
occasions
when
he
had
stayed
in
his
brother
house
he
had
been
greatly
occupied
with
his
own
plans
requests
for
money
invariably
refused
schemes
for
making
money
plots
to
frighten
his
brother
out
of
one
or
other
of
his
possessions
he
had
been
frankly
predatory
and
that
plain
quiet
girl
his
niece
had
been
pleasant
company
but
no
more
now
she
was
suddenly
of
the
first
importance
she
would
in
all
probability
inherit
a
considerable
sum
how
much
there
might
be
in
that
black
box
under
the
bed
one
could
not
say
but
surely
you
could
not
be
so
relentless
a
miser
for
so
long
a
period
without
accumulating
a
very
agreeable
amount
did
the
girl
realise
that
she
would
perhaps
be
rich
uncle
mathew
licked
his
lips
with
his
tongue
so
quiet
and
was
she
that
you
could
not
tell
what
she
was
thinking
were
she
only
pretty
she
might
marry
anybody
as
it
was
with
that
figure
but
she
was
a
good
girl
uncle
mathew
felt
kind
and
towards
her
he
would
advise
her
about
life
of
which
he
had
had
a
very
considerable
experience
and
of
which
of
course
she
knew
nothing
his
heart
was
warm
although
it
would
have
been
warmer
still
had
he
been
able
to
drink
a
glass
of
something
before
starting
out
and
what
will
you
do
now
my
dear
do
you
think
he
asked
they
had
left
the
deep
lanes
and
struck
across
the
fields
a
thin
powder
of
snow
lay
upon
the
land
and
under
the
yellow
light
of
the
winter
sky
the
surface
was
blue
shadowed
with
white
patches
where
the
snow
had
fallen
more
thickly
the
trees
and
hedges
were
black
and
hard
against
the
white
horizon
that
was
tightly
stretched
like
the
paper
of
a
japanese
screen
the
smell
of
burning
wood
was
in
the
air
and
once
and
again
a
rook
slowly
swung
its
wheel
cutting
the
air
as
it
flew
the
cold
was
so
pleasantly
sharp
that
it
was
the
best
possible
thing
for
uncle
mathew
who
was
accustomed
to
an
atmosphere
of
hissing
gas
unwashen
glasses
and
rinds
of
cheese
maggie
did
not
answer
his
question
but
herself
asked
one
uncle
mathew
do
you
believe
in
religion
religion
my
dear
answered
her
uncle
greatly
startled
at
so
unusual
a
question
what
sort
of
religion
the
kind
of
religion
that
father
preached
about
every
sunday
the
christian
religion
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
he
answered
confidentially
never
had
much
time
to
think
about
it
with
some
men
you
see
part
of
their
lives
and
with
others
well
it
is
my
lines
never
ran
that
way
was
father
very
religious
when
he
was
young
no
i
ca
say
that
he
was
but
then
we
never
got
on
your
father
and
i
our
lines
did
run
together
at
all
but
i
should
have
called
him
a
religious
man
then
all
this
time
father
has
been
lying
her
uncle
gazed
at
her
apprehensively
he
did
not
wish
to
undermine
her
faith
in
her
father
on
the
very
day
after
his
death
but
he
was
so
ignorant
about
her
her
thoughts
and
beliefs
and
desires
that
he
did
not
know
what
her
idea
of
her
father
had
been
his
idea
of
him
had
always
been
that
he
was
a
dirty
miserly
scoundrel
but
that
was
not
quite
the
thing
for
a
daughter
to
feel
and
there
was
an
innocence
and
simplicity
about
maggie
that
perplexed
him
i
ca
truly
say
that
i
ever
knew
what
your
father
private
feelings
were
he
never
cared
for
me
enough
to
tell
me
he
may
have
been
very
religious
in
his
real
thoughts
we
never
discussed
such
things
maggie
turned
round
upon
him
i
know
you
pretending
you
said
to
yourself
must
tell
her
what
i
think
about
her
father
the
very
day
after
his
death
that
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
do
we
all
got
to
pretend
that
he
was
splendid
but
he
was
never
who
can
know
it
better
than
i
he
worry
mother
until
she
died
did
he
lead
me
an
awful
life
always
and
are
i
delighted
now
that
he
dead
it
everything
to
me
longed
for
this
day
for
years
and
now
we
got
to
pretend
that
sorry
and
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
he
were
alive
it
be
a
good
thing
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
every
one
he
was
a
bad
man
and
i
hated
him
then
quite
suddenly
she
cried
turning
away
from
her
uncle
she
folded
her
face
in
her
arms
like
a
small
child
and
sobbed
standing
looking
at
her
bent
shoulders
her
square
ugly
figure
her
shabby
old
hat
with
its
dingy
black
ribbon
pushed
a
little
to
the
side
of
her
head
uncle
mathew
thought
that
she
was
a
most
uncomprehensible
girl
if
she
felt
like
that
about
her
father
why
should
she
cry
and
if
she
cried
she
must
surely
have
some
affection
for
his
memory
all
he
could
say
was
there
there
my
dear
well
well
it
all
right
he
felt
foolish
and
helpless
she
turned
round
at
last
drying
her
eyes
it
such
a
shame
she
said
still
sobbing
that
that
what
i
shall
feel
about
him
he
all
i
had
and
that
what
i
feel
but
if
you
knew
if
you
knew
all
the
things
he
did
they
walked
on
again
entering
rothin
wood
he
never
tried
to
make
me
religious
she
went
on
he
did
care
what
i
felt
i
sat
in
the
choir
and
i
took
a
class
and
i
visited
the
villagers
but
i
myself
what
happened
to
me
he
did
care
he
never
took
any
trouble
about
the
church
he
just
gabbled
the
prayers
and
preached
the
same
old
sermons
people
in
the
village
said
it
was
a
scandal
and
that
he
ought
to
be
turned
out
but
no
one
ever
did
anything
they
clean
everything
up
now
there
be
a
new
clergyman
they
mend
the
holes
in
the
kitchen
floor
and
the
ceiling
of
my
bedroom
it
will
be
all
new
and
fresh
and
what
will
you
do
maggie
said
her
uncle
trying
to
make
his
voice
indifferent
as
though
he
had
no
personal
interest
in
her
plans
i
have
thought
yet
she
said
i
an
idea
he
went
on
what
do
you
say
to
your
living
with
me
a
nice
little
place
somewhere
in
london
i
felt
for
a
long
time
that
i
should
settle
down
your
father
will
have
left
you
a
little
money
not
much
perhaps
but
just
enough
for
us
to
manage
comfortably
and
there
we
be
as
easy
as
anything
i
can
see
us
very
happy
together
but
he
did
not
as
yet
know
his
niece
she
shook
her
head
no
she
said
i
going
to
live
with
aunt
anne
and
aunt
elizabeth
we
would
be
happy
uncle
you
and
i
our
house
would
always
be
in
a
mess
and
there
are
so
many
things
that
i
must
learn
that
only
another
woman
could
teach
me
i
never
had
a
chance
with
father
he
had
entered
upon
this
little
walk
with
every
intention
of
settling
the
whole
affair
before
their
return
he
had
had
no
idea
of
any
opposition
her
ignorance
of
the
world
would
make
her
easy
to
adapt
but
now
when
he
saw
that
she
had
already
considered
the
matter
and
was
firmly
resolved
his
arguments
deserted
him
just
consider
a
moment
he
said
i
think
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
live
with
the
aunts
she
answered
firmly
they
have
wished
it
before
of
course
then
it
was
impossible
but
now
it
will
do
very
well
he
had
one
more
attempt
you
wo
be
happy
there
my
dear
with
all
their
religion
and
the
rest
of
it
and
two
old
maids
you
see
no
life
at
all
that
depends
upon
myself
she
answered
and
as
to
their
religion
at
least
they
believe
in
it
yes
your
aunt
anne
is
a
very
sincere
woman
uncle
mathew
answered
grimly
he
was
angry
and
helpless
she
seemed
suddenly
some
one
with
whom
it
was
impossible
to
argue
he
had
intended
to
be
pathetic
to
paint
delightful
pictures
of
uncle
and
niece
sheltering
snugly
together
defended
by
their
affection
against
a
cold
and
hostile
london
his
own
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
as
he
thought
of
it
what
a
hard
girl
she
was
nevertheless
for
the
moment
he
abandoned
the
subject
that
she
should
go
and
live
with
her
aunts
was
not
for
maggie
in
any
way
a
new
idea
a
number
of
years
ago
when
she
had
been
a
little
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
her
father
had
had
a
most
violent
quarrel
with
his
sister
anne
maggie
had
never
known
the
exact
cause
of
this
although
even
at
that
period
she
suspected
that
it
was
in
some
way
connected
with
money
she
found
afterwards
that
her
father
had
considered
that
certain
pieces
of
furniture
bequeathed
to
the
family
by
a
defunct
relation
were
his
and
not
his
sister
miss
anne
cardinal
a
lady
of
strong
character
clung
to
her
sofa
cabinet
and
porcelain
bowls
and
successfully
maintained
her
right
the
reverend
charles
forbade
the
further
mention
of
her
name
by
any
member
of
his
household
this
quarrel
was
a
grievous
disappointment
to
maggie
who
had
often
been
promised
that
when
she
should
be
a
good
girl
she
should
go
and
stay
with
her
aunts
in
london
she
had
invented
for
herself
a
strange
fascinating
picture
of
the
dark
mysterious
london
house
with
london
like
a
magic
cauldron
bubbling
beyond
it
there
was
moreover
the
further
strangeness
of
her
aunt
religion
her
father
in
his
anger
had
spoken
about
their
wicked
blasphemy
their
insolence
in
the
eyes
of
god
their
blindness
and
ignorant
conceit
maggie
had
discovered
on
a
later
day
from
her
uncle
that
her
aunts
belonged
to
a
sect
known
as
the
kingscote
brethren
and
that
the
main
feature
of
their
creed
was
that
they
expected
the
second
coming
of
the
lord
god
upon
earth
at
no
very
distant
date
will
it
really
happen
uncle
mathew
she
asked
in
an
voice
when
she
first
heard
this
it
all
bunkum
if
you
ask
me
said
her
uncle
and
it
had
a
hardening
effect
on
your
aunts
who
were
kind
women
once
but
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
blackguard
who
runs
their
chapel
poor
innocents
i
wring
his
neck
if
i
caught
him
all
this
was
very
fascinating
to
maggie
who
was
of
a
practical
mind
with
regard
to
the
facts
immediately
before
her
but
had
beyond
them
a
lively
imagination
her
life
had
been
so
lonely
spent
for
the
most
part
so
far
from
children
of
her
own
age
that
she
had
no
test
of
reality
she
did
not
see
any
reason
why
the
lord
god
should
not
come
again
and
she
saw
every
reason
why
her
aunts
should
condemn
her
uncle
that
london
house
swam
now
in
a
light
struck
partly
from
the
wisdom
and
omniscience
of
her
aunts
partly
from
god
threatened
descent
upon
them
aunt
anne
name
was
no
longer
mentioned
in
dreot
but
maggie
did
not
forget
and
at
every
new
tyranny
from
her
father
she
thought
to
herself
well
there
is
london
i
shall
be
there
one
day
as
they
walked
maggie
looked
at
her
uncle
what
was
he
really
he
should
be
a
gentleman
and
yet
he
did
look
like
one
she
remembered
things
that
he
had
at
different
times
said
to
her
why
look
at
myself
he
had
on
earlier
days
from
his
drop
at
the
and
bush
exclaimed
to
maggie
i
ca
call
myself
a
success
i
a
rotten
failure
if
you
want
to
know
and
i
had
most
things
in
my
favour
to
start
with
went
to
cambridge
had
a
good
opening
as
a
barrister
but
it
was
quick
enough
for
me
i
was
restless
and
wanted
to
jump
the
moon
now
look
at
me
same
with
your
father
only
he
put
all
his
imagination
into
money
same
as
your
aunts
have
put
theirs
into
religion
we
not
like
ordinary
people
us
cardinals
and
have
i
got
a
lot
of
imagination
too
maggie
had
asked
on
one
occasion
i
sure
i
do
know
her
uncle
had
answered
her
you
do
look
to
me
like
a
cardinal
at
all
much
too
quiet
but
you
may
have
it
somewhere
look
out
for
a
bad
time
if
you
have
today
maggie
abrupt
checking
of
his
projects
had
made
him
sulky
and
he
talked
but
little
damn
it
all
he
had
started
out
with
the
most
charming
intentions
towards
the
girl
and
now
look
at
her
was
it
natural
conduct
in
the
day
after
she
had
lost
her
only
protector
no
it
was
not
had
she
been
pretty
he
might
have
even
now
forgiven
her
but
today
she
looked
especially
plain
with
her
pale
face
and
shabby
black
dress
and
her
obstinate
mouth
and
chin
he
was
uneasy
too
about
the
imminent
arrival
of
his
sister
anne
who
always
frightened
him
and
made
him
think
poorly
of
the
world
in
general
no
hope
of
getting
any
money
out
of
her
nor
would
charles
have
left
him
a
penny
it
was
a
rotten
unsympathetic
world
and
uncle
mathew
cursed
god
as
he
strutted
sulkily
along
maggie
also
had
fallen
into
silence
they
came
at
last
out
of
the
wood
and
stood
at
the
edge
of
it
with
the
pine
trees
behind
them
looking
down
over
polchester
on
this
afternoon
polchester
with
the
thin
covering
of
snow
upon
its
roofs
sparkled
like
a
city
under
glass
the
cathedral
was
dim
in
the
mist
of
the
early
dusk
and
the
sun
setting
behind
the
hill
with
its
last
rays
caught
the
windows
so
that
they
blazed
through
the
haze
like
smoking
fires
whilst
maggie
and
her
uncle
stood
there
the
bells
began
to
ring
for
evensong
and
the
sound
like
a
faint
echo
seemed
to
come
from
behind
them
out
of
the
wood
in
the
spring
all
the
polchester
orchards
would
be
white
and
pink
with
blossom
in
the
summer
the
river
that
encircled
the
city
wall
would
run
like
a
blue
scarf
between
its
green
sloping
hills
now
there
was
frost
and
snow
and
mist
with
the
fires
smouldering
at
its
heart
she
gazed
at
it
now
as
she
had
never
gazed
at
it
before
she
was
going
into
it
now
her
life
was
beginning
at
last
when
the
sun
had
left
the
windows
and
the
walls
were
grey
she
turned
back
into
the
wood
and
led
the
way
silently
towards
home
the
house
that
night
was
very
strange
with
her
father
dead
in
it
she
sat
because
she
thought
it
her
duty
in
his
bedroom
he
lay
on
his
bed
with
his
beard
carefully
combed
and
brushed
now
spread
out
upon
the
sheet
his
closed
eyes
and
mouth
gave
him
a
grave
and
reverend
appearance
which
he
had
never
worn
in
his
life
he
lay
there
under
the
flickering
like
some
saint
who
at
length
after
a
life
of
severe
discipline
had
entered
into
the
joy
of
his
lord
beneath
the
bed
was
the
big
black
box
maggie
did
not
look
at
her
father
she
sat
there
near
the
dark
window
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
she
thought
of
nothing
at
all
except
the
rats
she
was
not
afraid
of
them
but
they
worried
her
they
had
been
a
trouble
in
the
house
for
a
long
time
past
poison
had
been
laid
for
them
and
they
had
refused
to
take
it
they
had
had
perhaps
some
fear
of
the
reverend
charles
at
any
rate
they
scampered
and
scurried
now
behind
the
wainscoting
as
though
conscious
of
their
release
even
the
rats
are
glad
maggie
thought
to
herself
in
the
uncertain
the
fancy
seized
her
that
one
rat
a
very
large
one
had
crept
out
from
his
hole
crawled
on
to
the
bed
and
now
sat
on
the
sheet
looking
at
her
father
it
would
be
a
horrible
thing
did
the
rat
walk
across
her
father
beard
and
yet
for
her
life
she
could
not
move
she
waited
fascinated
she
fancied
that
the
beard
stirred
a
little
as
though
the
rat
had
moved
it
she
fancied
that
the
rat
grew
and
grew
in
size
now
there
were
many
of
them
all
with
their
little
sharp
beady
eyes
watching
the
corpse
now
there
were
none
only
the
large
limbs
outlined
beneath
the
spread
the
waxen
face
the
ticking
clock
the
strange
empty
shape
of
his
grey
hanging
upon
a
nail
on
the
wall
where
was
her
father
gone
she
did
not
know
she
did
not
care
only
she
trusted
that
she
would
never
meet
him
again
never
again
her
head
nodded
her
hands
and
feet
were
cold
the
jumped
the
rats
scampered
she
slept
when
it
was
quite
dark
beyond
the
windows
and
the
candles
were
low
maggie
came
downstairs
stiff
cold
and
very
hungry
she
felt
that
it
was
wrong
to
have
slept
and
very
wrong
to
be
hungry
but
there
it
was
she
did
not
pretend
to
herself
that
things
were
other
than
they
were
in
the
she
found
supper
laid
out
upon
the
table
cold
beef
potatoes
in
their
jackets
cold
beetroot
jelly
and
cheese
and
her
uncle
playing
cards
on
the
unoccupied
end
of
the
table
in
a
melancholy
manner
by
himself
she
felt
that
it
was
wrong
of
him
to
play
cards
on
such
an
occasion
but
the
cards
were
such
dirty
grey
ones
and
he
obtained
obviously
so
little
pleasure
from
his
amusement
that
he
could
not
be
considered
to
be
wildly
abandoning
himself
to
riot
and
extravagance
she
felt
pleasure
in
his
company
for
the
first
time
since
her
death
she
was
a
little
frightened
and
uneasy
she
might
even
have
gone
to
him
and
cried
on
his
shoulder
had
he
given
her
any
encouragement
but
he
did
not
speak
to
her
except
to
say
that
he
had
already
eaten
he
was
still
a
little
sulky
with
her
when
she
had
finished
her
meal
she
sat
in
her
accustomed
chair
by
the
fire
her
head
propped
on
her
hands
looking
into
the
flame
and
there
memories
conversations
scenes
trooped
before
her
eyes
as
though
they
were
bidding
her
a
long
farewell
she
did
not
as
she
sat
there
sentimentalise
about
any
of
them
she
saw
them
as
they
were
some
happy
some
unhappy
some
terrifying
some
amusing
all
of
them
dead
and
passed
grey
and
thin
the
life
gone
out
of
them
her
mind
was
fixed
on
the
future
what
was
it
going
to
be
would
she
have
money
as
her
uncle
had
said
would
she
see
london
and
the
world
would
she
find
friends
people
who
would
be
glad
to
be
with
her
and
have
her
with
them
what
would
her
aunts
be
like
and
so
from
them
what
about
all
the
other
members
of
the
family
of
whom
she
had
heard
she
painted
for
herself
a
gay
scene
in
which
at
the
door
of
some
great
house
a
fine
gathering
of
cardinals
waited
with
smiles
and
outstretched
hands
to
welcome
her
then
laughing
at
herself
as
she
always
did
when
she
had
allowed
her
fancy
free
rein
she
shook
her
head
no
it
certainly
would
not
be
like
that
relations
were
not
like
that
that
was
not
the
way
to
face
the
world
to
encourage
romantic
dreams
her
uncle
watching
her
surreptitiously
wondered
of
what
she
was
thinking
her
determined
treatment
of
him
that
afternoon
continued
to
surprise
him
she
certainly
ought
to
make
her
way
in
the
world
but
what
a
pity
that
she
was
so
plain
perhaps
if
she
got
some
colour
into
her
cheeks
dressed
better
brushed
her
hair
differently
no
her
mouth
would
always
be
too
large
and
her
nose
too
small
and
her
figure
was
absurd
uncle
mathew
considered
that
he
was
a
judge
of
women
he
rose
at
last
and
rather
shamefacedly
said
that
he
should
go
to
bed
maggie
wondered
at
the
confusion
that
she
detected
in
him
she
looked
at
him
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
good
night
uncle
mathew
he
looked
at
her
then
and
noticed
by
her
white
face
and
eyes
what
a
strain
the
day
had
been
to
her
he
saw
again
the
figure
in
the
shabby
black
hat
sobbing
in
the
lane
he
suddenly
put
his
arms
about
her
and
held
her
close
to
him
she
noticed
that
he
smelled
of
whisky
but
she
felt
his
kindness
and
putting
her
hand
on
his
fat
shoulder
kissed
once
more
his
cheek
when
he
had
left
her
her
weariness
came
suddenly
down
upon
her
overwhelming
her
as
though
the
roof
had
fallen
in
the
lamp
swelled
before
her
tired
eyes
as
though
it
had
been
an
evil
unhealthy
flower
the
table
slid
into
the
chairs
and
the
cold
beef
leered
at
the
jelly
the
pictures
jumped
and
the
clock
ran
in
a
mad
scurry
backwards
and
forwards
she
dragged
her
dazed
body
up
through
the
silent
house
to
her
bedroom
undressed
was
instantly
in
bed
and
asleep
she
slept
without
dreams
but
woke
suddenly
as
though
she
had
been
flung
into
the
midst
of
one
she
sat
up
in
bed
knowing
from
the
thumping
of
her
heart
that
she
was
seized
with
panic
but
finding
in
the
first
flash
no
reason
for
her
alarm
the
room
was
pitch
black
with
shadows
of
light
here
and
there
but
she
had
with
her
in
the
confusion
of
her
sleep
uncertainty
as
to
the
different
parts
of
the
room
what
had
awakened
her
of
what
was
she
frightened
then
suddenly
as
one
slits
a
black
screen
with
a
knife
a
thin
line
of
light
cracked
the
darkness
as
though
some
one
had
whispered
it
in
her
ear
she
knew
that
the
door
was
there
and
the
dark
well
of
uncertainty
into
which
she
had
been
plunged
was
suddenly
changed
into
her
own
room
where
she
could
recognise
the
window
the
chest
of
drawers
the
the
chairs
some
one
was
opening
her
door
and
her
first
thought
that
it
was
of
course
her
father
was
checked
instantly
by
the
knowledge
conveyed
again
as
though
some
one
had
whispered
to
her
that
her
father
was
dead
the
thin
line
of
light
was
now
a
wedge
it
wavered
drew
back
to
a
spider
thread
again
then
broadened
with
a
flush
of
colour
into
a
streaming
path
some
one
stood
in
the
doorway
holding
a
candle
maggie
saw
that
it
was
uncle
mathew
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
what
is
it
she
said
he
swayed
as
he
stood
there
his
candle
making
fantastic
leaps
and
shallows
of
light
he
was
smiling
at
her
in
a
silly
way
and
she
saw
that
he
was
drunk
she
had
had
a
horror
of
drunkenness
ever
since
as
a
little
girl
she
had
watched
an
inebriated
carter
kicking
his
wife
she
always
after
that
saw
the
woman
bent
head
and
stooping
shoulders
now
she
knew
sitting
up
in
bed
that
she
was
frightened
not
only
of
uncle
mathew
but
of
the
house
of
the
whole
world
she
was
alone
she
realised
her
loneliness
in
a
great
flash
of
bewilderment
and
cold
terror
as
though
the
ground
had
suddenly
broken
away
from
her
and
she
was
on
the
edge
of
a
vast
pit
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
to
help
her
her
father
was
dead
the
cook
and
the
maid
were
sunk
in
heavy
slumber
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
she
was
alone
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
the
shock
of
that
discovery
she
realised
that
she
would
always
be
alone
now
for
the
rest
of
her
life
what
is
it
uncle
mathew
she
said
again
her
voice
was
steady
although
her
heart
hammered
some
other
part
of
her
brain
was
wondering
where
it
was
that
he
had
got
the
drink
he
must
have
had
a
bottle
of
whisky
in
his
room
she
remembered
his
shyness
when
he
said
to
her
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
swaying
on
his
feet
and
smiling
at
her
the
flame
of
the
light
rose
and
fell
in
jerks
and
spasms
i
thought
he
said
i
come
to
see
maggie
niece
jus
to
talk
a
lill
bit
and
cheer
her
up
up
he
drew
nearer
the
bed
she
be
lonely
i
said
lonely
very
are
you
lonely
maggie
it
very
late
she
said
and
you
dropping
grease
ail
over
the
floor
with
that
candle
you

back
to
bed
uncle
i
all
right

to

not
back
to
bed
it
soon
be
mornin
that
be
we
talk
together
till
mornin
he
put
the
candle
on
a
chair
nearly
falling
as
he
did
so
then
came
towards
her
he
stood
over
her
his
shirt
open
at
the
neck
protuberating
over
his
stomach
his
short
thick
legs
swaying
his
red
unshaven
face
with
the
trembling
lips
was
hateful
to
her
suddenly
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
put
his
hands
out
towards
her
he
caught
her
hair
my
little
maggie
my
little
maggie
he
said
the
fright
the
terror
the
panic
that
seized
her
was
like
the
sudden
rising
of
some
black
figure
who
grew
before
her
bent
towards
her
and
with
cold
hard
fingers
squeezed
her
throat
for
an
instant
she
was
helpless
quivering
weak
in
every
bone
of
her
body
then
some
one
said
to
her
but
you
can
manage
this
i
can
manage
this
she
answered
almost
aloud
you
alone
now
you
must
let
things
be
too
much
for
you
she
jumped
out
of
bed
on
the
farther
side
away
from
her
uncle
she
put
on
her
she
stood
and
pointed
at
the
door
now
uncle
you
go
back
to
your
room
at
once
it
disgraceful
coming
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
disturbing
every
one
go
back
to
bed
the
new
tone
in
her
voice
startled
him
he
looked
at
her
in
a
bewildered
fashion
he
got
up
from
the
bed
why
maggie
i
only
only
he
stared
from
her
to
the
candle
and
from
the
candle
back
to
her
again
now
go
she
repeated
quick
now
he
hung
his
head
now
you
angry
angry
with
your
poor
ole
uncle
poor
ole
uncle
he
looked
at
her
his
eyes
puzzled
as
though
he
had
never
seen
her
before
you
very
hard
he
said
shaking
his
head
he
stumbled
towards
the
door
very
hard
he
repeated
and
went
out
his
head
still
hanging
she
heard
him
knock
his
foot
against
the
stairs
soon
there
was
silence
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
went
back
to
bed
she
lay
there
her
heart
at
first
throbbing
her
eyes
straining
the
darkness
then
she
grew
more
tranquil
she
felt
in
her
heart
a
strange
triumph
as
though
already
she
had
begun
life
and
had
begun
it
with
success
she
thought
before
she
sank
deep
into
sleep
that
anything
would
yield
to
one
did
one
only
deal
sensibly
with
it
after
all
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
be
alone
chapter
ii
aunt
anne
in
the
morning
however
she
discovered
no
fine
things
anywhere
the
hours
that
had
elapsed
since
her
father
death
had
wrought
in
him
a
he
had
gained
nobility
almost
beauty
she
wondered
with
a
desolate
whether
during
all
those
years
she
had
been
to
blame
and
not
he
perhaps
he
had
wished
for
sympathy
and
intimacy
and
she
had
repulsed
him
his
little
possessions
here
and
there
about
the
house
reproached
her
uncle
mathew
had
a
bad
headache
and
would
not
come
down
to
breakfast
she
felt
indignant
with
him
but
also
indulgent
he
had
shown
himself
hopelessly
lacking
in
good
taste
and
good
feeling
but
then
she
had
never
supposed
that
he
had
these
things
at
the
same
time
the
last
support
seemed
to
have
been
removed
from
her
it
might
well
be
that
her
aunt
anne
would
not
care
for
her
and
would
not
wish
to
have
her
in
her
house
what
should
she
do
then
whither
should
she
go
she
flung
up
her
head
and
looked
bravely
into
the
face
of
ellen
the
cook
who
came
to
remove
the
breakfast
but
she
had
to
bite
her
lip
to
keep
back
the
tears
that
would
come
and
fill
her
eyes
so
that
the
world
was
misty
and
obscure
there
was
she
fancied
something
strange
about
ellen
in
her
eyes
some
obscure
triumph
or
excitement
some
scorn
and
derision
maggie
fancied
of
herself
had
the
woman
been
drinking
then
there
arrived
brassy
her
father
solicitor
from
cator
hill
he
had
been
often
in
the
house
a
short
fat
man
with
a
purple
face
clothes
of
a
horsy
cut
and
large
red
swollen
fingers
he
took
now
possession
of
the
house
with
much
well
miss
maggie
he
blew
his
words
at
her
as
a
child
blows
here
we
are
then
very
sad
indeed
very
i
been
through
the
house
got
the
will
all
right
your
aunt
you
say
will
be
with
us
my
aunt
from
london
miss
anne
cardinal
i
expect
her
in
half
an
hour
she
should
have
arrived
at
clinton
by
the
nine
train
well
well
yes
yes
indeed
your
uncle
is
also
here
yes
he
will
be
down
shortly
very
good
miss
maggie
very
good
she
hated
that
he
should
call
her
miss
maggie
he
had
always
treated
her
with
considerable
respect
but
she
fancied
that
he
patronised
her
he
placed
his
hand
for
a
moment
on
her
shoulder
and
she
shrank
back
he
felt
her
action
and
abashed
a
little
coughed
and
blew
his
nose
he
strutted
about
the
room
then
the
door
opened
and
ellen
the
cook
looked
in
upon
them
i
only
wished
to
see
miss
whether
i
could
do
anything
for
you
nothing
thank
you
said
maggie
been
with
you
some
time
that
woman
said
brassy
yes
said
maggie
about
five
years
i
think
hum
hum
name
of
harmer
yes
harmer
not
married
no
answered
maggie
wondering
at
this
interest
not
so
far
as
you
know
no
she
always
miss
harmer
quite
so
quite
so
dear
me
yes
other
people
appeared
asked
questions
and
vanished
it
seemed
to
have
been
all
taken
out
of
her
hands
and
it
was
strange
how
desolate
this
made
her
for
so
many
years
she
had
had
the
management
of
that
house
since
her
fourteenth
birthday
indeed
ugly
and
dilapidated
though
the
place
had
been
it
had
grown
after
a
time
to
belong
to
her
and
she
had
felt
as
though
it
were
in
some
way
grateful
to
her
for
keeping
it
poor
thing
together
now
it
had
suddenly
withdrawn
itself
and
was
preparing
for
the
next
comer
maggie
felt
this
quite
definitely
and
thought
that
probably
it
was
glad
that
now
its
roof
would
be
mended
and
its
floors
made
whole
it
had
thrown
her
off
well
she
would
not
burden
it
long
there
were
sounds
then
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
the
old
dilapidated
cab
from
clinton
with
its
ricketty
windows
and
seats
that
smelt
of
straw
and
beer
was
standing
at
the
door
the
horse
puffing
great
breaths
of
steam
into
the
frozen
air
her
aunt
had
arrived
maggie
standing
behind
the
window
looked
out
the
carriage
door
opened
and
a
figure
that
seemed
unusually
tall
appeared
to
straighten
itself
out
and
rose
to
its
full
height
on
the
gravel
path
as
though
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
cab
pressed
together
its
head
upon
its
knees
then
in
the
hall
that
was
dark
even
on
the
brightest
day
aunt
anne
revealed
herself
as
a
lady
tall
indeed
but
not
too
tall
of
a
fine
carriage
in
a
black
rather
shabby
dress
and
a
black
bonnet
her
face
was
grave
and
sharply
pointed
with
dark
eyes
sad
rather
and
of
the
pale
remote
colour
that
the
virgin
in
the
dreot
east
end
window
wears
standing
there
in
the
dusky
hall
quietly
quite
apart
from
the
little
bustle
that
surrounded
her
she
seemed
to
maggie
even
in
that
first
moment
like
some
one
wrapt
caught
away
into
her
own
visions
i
paid
the
cabman
five
shillings
she
said
very
softly
i
hope
that
was
right
and
you
are
maggie
are
you
she
bent
down
and
kissed
her
her
lips
were
warm
and
comforting
maggie
who
had
when
she
was
shy
something
of
the
manner
of
a
boy
said
yes
that
all
right
we
generally
give
him
four
and
six
they
went
into
the
where
was
brassy
he
came
forward
to
them
blowing
his
words
at
them
rubbing
his
hands
miss
cardinal
i
am
honoured
my
name
is
brassy
your
lawyer
very
very
sad
so
sudden
so
sudden
the
funeral
is
at
twelve
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
miss
cardinal
did
not
regard
him
at
all
and
maggie
saw
that
this
annoyed
him
the
girl
watched
her
aunt
conscious
of
some
strange
new
excitement
at
her
heart
she
had
never
seen
any
one
who
in
the
least
resembled
this
remote
silent
woman
maggie
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
she
had
expected
but
certainly
it
had
not
been
this
there
was
something
in
her
aunt
face
that
recalled
her
father
and
her
uncle
something
in
the
eyes
something
in
the
width
and
height
of
the
forehead
but
this
resemblance
only
accentuated
the
astounding
difference
maggie
first
impression
was
her
ultimate
one
that
her
aunt
had
strayed
out
of
some
window
into
a
wild
world
that
did
not
bewilder
her
only
because
she
did
not
seriously
regard
it
maggie
found
herself
wondering
who
had
fastened
her
aunt
buttons
and
strings
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
how
had
she
ever
travelled
in
the
right
train
and
descended
at
the
right
station
how
could
she
remember
such
trifles
when
her
thoughts
were
fixed
on
such
distant
compelling
dreams
the
pale
oval
face
the
black
hair
brushed
back
from
the
forehead
the
thin
hands
with
long
tapering
fingers
the
black
dress
the
slender
upright
body
this
figure
against
the
cold
bright
winter
sunlight
was
a
picture
that
remained
always
from
that
day
in
soul
her
aunt
looked
about
her
as
though
she
had
just
awaked
from
sleep
would
you
care
to
come
up
to
your
room
asked
maggie
feeling
the
embarrassment
of
brassy
presence
yes
dear
thank
you
i
will
said
miss
cardinal
they
moved
from
the
room
aunt
anne
walking
with
a
strange
almost
clumsy
uncertainty
halting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
as
though
she
had
never
learnt
to
trust
her
legs
a
movement
with
which
maggie
was
to
become
intensely
familiar
it
was
as
though
her
aunt
had
flown
in
some
earlier
existence
and
had
never
become
accustomed
to
this
clumsier
earthly
fashion
the
spare
bedroom
was
a
bright
room
with
a
broad
high
window
the
view
was
magnificent
looking
over
the
hill
that
dropped
below
the
vicarage
out
across
fields
and
streams
to
cator
hill
to
the
right
into
the
heart
of
the
dreot
woods
to
the
left
to
the
green
valley
through
whose
reeds
and
sloping
shadows
the
lisp
gleamed
like
a
burnished
wire
threading
its
way
to
the
sea
there
was
a
chair
by
the
window
against
this
miss
cardinal
stood
her
thin
body
reflected
motionless
as
though
it
had
been
painted
in
a
long
glass
behind
her
she
gazed
before
her
maggie
saw
that
she
was
agitated
passionately
moved
the
sun
catching
the
on
the
frozen
soil
turned
the
world
to
crystal
and
in
every
field
were
little
shallows
of
blue
light
the
dreot
woods
were
deep
black
with
flickering
golden
stars
she
tried
to
speak
she
could
not
tears
were
in
her
eyes
it
is
so
long
since
i
london
she
smiled
at
maggie
then
maggie
heard
her
say
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
therefore
can
i
lack
nothing
he
shall
feed
me
in
a
green
pasture
and
lead
me
forth
beside
the
waters
of
comfort
he
shall
convert
my
soul
and
bring
me
forth
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
for
his
name
sake
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
they
rod
and
thy
staff
comfort
me
thou
shalt
prepare
a
table
before
me
against
them
that
trouble
me
thou
hast
anointed
my
head
with
oil
and
my
cup
shall
be
full
but
thy
loving
kindness
and
mercy
shall
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
i
will
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
ever
there
was
a
pause
then
maggie
said
timidly
wo
you
take
off
your
bonnet
it
will
be
more
comfortable
thank
you
my
dear
she
took
off
her
bonnet
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
then
she
resumed
her
stand
at
the
window
her
eyes
lost
in
the
sunny
distance
i
did
wrong
she
said
as
though
she
were
speaking
to
herself
i
should
not
have
allowed
that
quarrel
with
your
father
i
regret
it
now
very
deeply
but
we
always
see
too
late
the
consequences
of
our
proud
she
turned
then
come
here
dear
she
said
maggie
came
to
her
her
aunt
looked
at
her
and
maggie
was
deeply
conscious
of
her
shabby
dress
her
rough
hands
her
ugly
boots
then
as
always
when
she
was
her
eyes
grew
haughty
and
her
mouth
defiant
her
aunt
kissed
her
her
cool
firm
fingers
against
the
girl
warm
neck
you
will
come
to
us
now
dear
you
should
have
come
long
ago
maggie
wanted
to
speak
but
she
could
not
we
will
try
to
make
you
happy
but
ours
is
not
an
exciting
life
maggie
eyes
lit
up
it
has
not
she
said
been
very
exciting
here
always
then
she
went
on
colour
in
her
cheeks
i
think
father
did
all
he
could
i
feel
now
that
there
were
a
lot
of
things
that
i
should
have
done
only
i
did
see
them
at
the
time
he
never
asked
me
to
help
him
but
i
wish
now
that
i
had
offered
or
suggested
her
lips
quivered
again
she
was
near
tears
and
again
as
it
had
been
on
her
walk
with
uncle
mathew
her
regret
was
not
for
her
father
but
for
the
waste
that
her
life
with
him
had
been
but
there
was
something
in
her
aunt
that
prevented
complete
confidence
she
seemed
in
something
to
be
outside
small
daily
troubles
before
they
could
speak
any
more
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
uncle
mathew
came
in
he
stood
there
looking
both
ashamed
of
himself
and
obstinate
he
most
certainly
did
not
appear
at
his
best
a
large
piece
of
plaster
on
his
right
cheek
showing
where
he
had
cut
himself
with
his
razor
and
a
shabby
and
tight
black
suit
it
was
his
london
suit
and
had
lain
crumpled
disastrously
in
his
accentuating
the
undue
roundness
of
his
limbs
his
eyes
blinked
and
his
mouth
trembled
a
little
at
the
corners
he
was
obviously
afraid
of
his
sister
and
flung
his
niece
a
watery
wink
as
though
to
implore
her
silence
as
to
his
various
misdemeanours
brother
and
sister
shook
hands
and
maggie
as
she
watched
them
was
surprised
to
feel
within
herself
a
certain
sympathy
with
her
uncle
aunt
anne
greeting
was
gentle
and
kind
but
infinitely
distant
and
had
something
of
the
tenderness
with
which
the
pope
washes
the
feet
of
the
beggars
in
rome
i
so
glad
that
you
were
here
she
said
in
her
soft
voice
it
must
have
been
such
a
comfort
to
maggie
he
has
been
indeed
aunt
anne
maggie
broke
in
eagerly
her
uncle
looked
at
her
with
great
surprise
after
his
behaviour
of
last
night
he
had
not
expected
this
reassured
he
began
a
voluble
explanation
of
his
movements
and
plans
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
turning
one
boot
against
the
other
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
because
he
had
seen
neither
of
his
sisters
for
a
very
long
time
then
he
wished
to
make
a
good
impression
because
maggie
the
heiress
would
be
of
importance
now
what
an
idiot
he
had
been
last
night
what
had
he
done
he
could
remember
nothing
it
was
evident
that
it
had
been
nothing
very
bad
maggie
bore
him
no
grudge
good
girl
maggie
he
felt
affectionate
towards
her
and
would
have
told
her
so
had
her
aunt
not
been
present
these
thoughts
underlay
his
rambling
history
he
was
aware
suddenly
that
his
audience
was
inattentive
he
saw
indeed
that
his
sister
was
standing
with
her
back
gazing
on
to
the
shining
country
beyond
the
window
he
ceased
abruptly
gave
his
niece
a
wink
and
when
this
was
unsuccessful
muttering
a
few
words
stumbled
out
of
the
room
the
whole
village
attended
the
funeral
not
because
it
liked
the
rev
charles
but
because
it
liked
funerals
maggie
was
in
all
probability
the
only
person
present
who
thought
very
deeply
about
the
late
vicar
of
dreot
the
rev
tom
trefusis
who
conducted
the
ceremony
was
a
large
man
who
had
played
rugby
football
for
his
university
and
spent
most
of
his
energy
over
the
development
of
cricket
and
football
clubs
up
and
down
the
county
he
could
not
be
expected
to
have
cared
very
greatly
for
the
rev
charles
who
had
been
at
no
period
of
his
life
and
in
no
possible
sense
of
the
word
a
sportsman
as
he
conducted
the
service
his
mind
speculated
as
to
the
next
vicar
the
rev
tom
knew
an
excellent
fellow
stroke
of
the
cambridge
boat
in
who
would
be
just
the
man
the
possibility
of
the
frost
breaking
in
time
for
the
rugby
match
at
truxe
the
immediate
return
of
his
wife
from
london
he
was
very
fond
of
his
wife
and
lastly
a
certain
cramp
in
the
stomach
that
sometimes
bowled
him
over
and
of
which
the
taking
of
a
funeral
here
and
gone
always
reminded
him
wonder
how
long
i
last
he
thought
as
he
stood
over
the
grave
of
the
rev
charles
and
let
his
eyes
wander
over
the
little
white
gravestones
that
ran
almost
into
the
dark
wall
of
dreot
woods
as
though
they
were
trying
to
hide
themselves
wish
the
frost
break
ground
be
as
hard
as
nails
the
soil
fell
thump
thump
upon
the
coffin
rooks
cawed
in
the
trees
the
bell
tolled
its
cracked
note
the
rev
charles
was
crammed
down
with
the
soil
by
the
eager
spades
of
the
sexton
and
his
friend
who
were
cold
and
wanted
a
drink
maggie
meanwhile
watched
the
final
disappearance
of
her
father
with
an
remorse
ever
since
her
declaration
to
her
uncle
during
their
walk
yesterday
this
new
picture
of
her
father
had
grown
before
her
eyes
she
had
already
forgotten
many
many
things
that
might
now
have
made
her
resentful
or
at
least
critical
she
saw
him
as
a
figure
most
disastrously
misunderstood
without
any
sentimentality
in
her
vision
she
saw
him
lonely
proud
reserved
longing
for
her
sympathy
which
she
denied
him
his
greed
for
money
she
saw
suddenly
as
a
determination
that
his
daughter
should
not
be
left
in
want
all
those
years
he
had
striven
and
his
apparent
harshness
sharpness
unkindness
had
been
that
he
might
pursue
his
great
object
she
did
not
cry
some
of
the
villagers
curiously
watching
her
thought
her
a
little
thing
but
her
heart
was
full
of
tenderness
as
she
stood
there
seeing
the
humped
grey
church
that
was
part
of
her
life
the
green
mounds
with
no
name
the
dark
wood
the
grey
roofs
of
the
village
clustered
below
the
hill
hearing
the
bell
the
rooks
the
healthy
voice
of
trefusis
the
bark
of
some
distant
dog
the
creak
of
some
distant
wheel
i
missed
my
chance
she
thought
if
only
now
i
could
have
told
him
her
aunt
stood
at
her
side
and
once
again
maggie
felt
irritation
at
her
composure
after
all
he
was
her
brother
she
thought
she
remembered
the
feeling
and
passion
with
which
her
aunt
had
repeated
the
psalm
she
was
puzzled
a
moment
of
shrinking
came
upon
her
as
she
thought
of
the
coming
london
life
then
the
service
was
over
the
villagers
with
that
inevitable
disappointment
that
always
lingers
after
a
funeral
went
to
their
homes
the
children
remained
until
night
under
the
illusion
that
it
was
sunday
maggie
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
for
the
most
part
alone
in
her
room
and
thinking
of
her
father
her
bedroom
an
attic
with
a
sloping
roof
contained
all
her
worldly
possessions
in
part
because
she
had
always
been
so
reserved
a
child
in
part
because
there
had
been
no
one
in
whom
she
might
confide
even
had
she
wished
it
she
had
always
placed
an
intensity
of
feeling
around
and
about
the
few
things
that
were
hers
her
library
was
very
small
but
this
did
not
distress
her
because
she
had
never
cared
for
reading
upon
the
little
hanging
shelf
above
her
bed
deal
wood
painted
white
with
blue
cornflowers
were
the
heir
of
redclyffe
a
shabby
copy
ministering
children
madame
how
and
lady
why
the
imitation
of
christ
robinson
crusoe
cookery
book
the
holy
bible
and
the
poems
of
longfellow
these
had
been
given
her
upon
various
christmasses
and
birthdays
she
did
not
care
for
any
of
them
except
the
imitation
of
christ
and
robinson
crusoe
the
bible
was
spoilt
for
her
by
incessant
services
and
sunday
school
classes
the
heir
of
redclyffe
and
ministering
children
she
found
absurdly
sentimental
and
unlike
any
life
that
she
had
ever
known
beeton
she
had
never
opened
and
longfellow
and
kingsley
natural
history
she
found
dull
for
robinson
crusoe
she
had
the
intense
human
sympathy
that
all
lonely
people
feel
for
that
masterpiece
the
imitation
pleased
her
by
what
she
would
have
called
its
common
sense
such
a
passage
for
example
oftentimes
something
lurketh
within
or
else
occurreth
from
without
which
draweth
us
after
it
many
secretly
seek
themselves
in
what
they
do
and
know
it
not
they
seem
also
to
live
in
good
peace
of
mind
when
things
are
done
according
to
their
will
and
opinion
but
if
things
happen
otherwise
than
they
desire
they
are
straightway
moved
and
much
vexed
and
behind
this
common
sense
she
did
seem
to
be
directly
in
touch
with
some
one
whom
she
might
find
had
she
more
time
and
friends
to
advise
her
she
was
conscious
in
her
lonely
hours
that
nothing
gave
her
such
a
feeling
of
company
as
did
this
little
battered
red
book
and
she
felt
that
that
friendliness
might
one
day
advance
to
some
greater
intimacy
about
these
things
she
was
intensely
reserved
and
she
spoke
of
them
to
no
human
being
even
for
the
books
for
whose
contents
she
did
not
care
she
had
a
kindly
feeling
so
often
had
they
looked
down
upon
her
when
she
sat
there
exasperated
angry
at
her
own
tears
rebellious
after
some
scene
with
her
father
no
other
place
but
this
room
had
seen
these
old
agonies
of
hers
she
would
be
sorry
after
all
to
leave
it
there
were
not
many
things
beside
the
books
two
bowls
of
blue
glebeshire
pottery
cheap
things
but
precious
a
box
plastered
with
coloured
shells
an
amber
bead
necklace
a
blue
leather
a
photograph
of
her
father
as
a
young
clergyman
with
a
beard
and
whiskers
a
faded
daguerreotype
of
her
mother
last
but
by
no
means
least
a
small
black
lacquer
that
played
two
tunes
weel
may
the
keel
row
and
john
peel
these
were
her
worldly
possessions
she
sat
there
as
the
day
closed
down
the
trees
were
swept
into
the
night
the
wind
rose
in
the
dark
wood
the
winter
moon
crept
pale
and
cold
into
the
sky
snow
began
to
fall
at
first
thinly
then
in
a
storm
hiding
the
moon
flinging
the
fields
and
roads
into
a
white
shining
splendour
the
wind
died
and
the
stars
peeped
between
the
flakes
of
whirling
snow
she
sat
without
moving
accusing
her
heart
of
hardness
of
unkindness
she
seemed
to
herself
then
deserving
of
every
punishment
if
i
had
only
gone
to
him
she
thought
again
and
again
she
remembered
how
she
had
kept
apart
from
him
enclosed
herself
in
a
reserve
that
he
should
never
break
she
remembered
the
times
when
he
had
scolded
her
coldly
bitterly
and
she
had
stood
her
face
as
a
rock
her
heart
beating
but
her
body
without
movement
then
had
turned
and
gone
silently
from
the
room
all
her
wicked
cold
heart
that
in
some
strange
way
cared
for
love
but
could
not
make
those
movements
towards
others
that
would
show
that
it
cared
what
was
it
in
her
would
she
always
through
life
miss
the
things
for
which
she
longed
through
her
coldness
and
obstinacy
she
took
her
father
photograph
stared
at
it
gazed
into
it
held
it
in
an
agony
of
remorse
she
shivered
in
the
cold
of
her
room
but
did
not
know
it
her
candle
caught
in
some
draught
blew
out
and
instantly
the
white
world
without
leapt
in
upon
her
and
her
room
was
lit
with
a
strange
unearthly
glow
she
saw
nothing
but
her
father
at
last
she
fell
asleep
in
the
chair
clutching
in
her
hand
the
photograph
thus
her
aunt
found
her
later
in
the
evening
she
was
touched
by
the
figure
the
shabby
black
frock
the
white
tired
face
she
had
been
honestly
disappointed
in
her
niece
disappointed
in
her
plainness
in
her
apparent
want
of
heart
in
her
silence
and
moroseness
mathew
had
told
her
of
the
girl
outburst
to
him
against
her
father
and
this
had
seemed
to
her
shocking
upon
the
very
day
after
that
father
death
now
when
she
saw
the
photograph
clenched
in
maggie
hand
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
said
maggie
dear
maggie
and
woke
her
maggie
stirring
saw
her
aunt
slender
figure
and
delicate
face
standing
in
the
snowlight
as
though
she
had
been
truly
a
saint
from
heaven
maggie
first
impulse
was
to
rise
up
fling
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
hug
her
had
she
done
that
the
history
of
her
life
might
have
been
changed
her
natural
shyness
checked
her
impulse
she
got
up
the
photograph
dropped
from
her
hand
she
smiled
a
little
and
then
said
awkwardly
i
been
asleep
do
you
want
me
i
come
down
her
aunt
drew
her
towards
her
maggie
dear
she
said
do
feel
lonely
any
more
think
of
me
and
your
aunt
elizabeth
as
your
friends
who
will
always
care
for
you
you
must
never
be
lonely
again
maggie
whole
heart
responded
she
felt
its
wild
beating
but
she
could
do
nothing
could
say
nothing
her
body
stiffened
in
spite
of
herself
she
withdrew
herself
her
face
reddened
then
was
pale
thank
you
aunt
was
all
she
could
say
her
aunt
moved
away
silently
they
went
downstairs
together
at
about
ten
the
next
morning
they
were
seated
in
the
aunt
anne
uncle
mathew
maggie
and
brassy
brassy
was
speaking
i
afraid
miss
cardinal
that
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
legality
of
this
it
has
been
duly
witnessed
and
signed
i
regret
extremely
but
as
you
can
well
understand
i
was
quite
unable
to
prevent
with
the
exception
of
a
legacy
of
pounds
sterling
to
miss
maggie
cardinal
everything
goes
to
miss
ellen
harmer
whom
i
owe
more
than
i
can
ever
possibly
thank
you
interrupted
aunt
anne
this
is
i
think
the
woman
who
has
been
cook
here
during
the
last
four
years
about
five
i
think
said
brassy
softly
uncle
mathew
was
upon
his
feet
trembling
this
is
monstrous
he
stuttered
absolutely
monstrous
of
course
an
appeal
will
be
made
undue
influence
the
most
abominable
thing
maggie
watched
them
all
as
though
the
whole
business
were
far
from
herself
she
sat
there
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
looking
at
the
mantelpiece
with
the
ugly
marble
clock
the
letter
clip
with
old
soiled
letters
in
it
the
fat
green
vase
with
dusty
everlastings
just
as
on
the
night
when
her
uncle
had
come
into
her
room
she
had
fancied
that
some
one
spoke
to
her
so
now
she
seemed
to
hear
ah
that
a
nasty
knock
for
you
a
very
nasty
knock
her
father
had
left
all
his
money
with
the
exception
of
pounds
sterling
to
ellen
the
cook
maggie
did
not
for
a
moment
speculate
as
to
the
probable
total
amount
three
hundred
pounds
seemed
to
her
a
very
large
sum
it
would
at
any
rate
give
her
something
to
begin
life
upon
but
the
thing
that
seized
and
held
her
was
the
secret
friendship
that
must
have
existed
between
her
father
and
ellen
secret
friendship
was
the
first
form
that
the
relationship
assumed
for
her
she
saw
ellen
red
of
face
with
little
eyes
and
a
flat
nose
upon
which
flies
used
to
settle
a
fat
short
neck
the
wheezings
and
the
pantings
the
stumping
walk
the
great
broad
back
and
she
saw
her
father
first
as
the
tall
dirty
man
whom
she
used
to
know
with
the
shiny
black
trousers
the
untidy
beard
the
frowning
eyes
the
nails
bitten
to
the
quick
the
ragged
then
as
that
veiled
shape
below
the
clothes
the
lift
of
the
sheet
above
the
toes
the
loins
the
stomach
the
beard
neatly
brushed
the
closed
yellow
eyelids
the
yellow
forehead
the
rats
with
their
gleaming
eyes
in
a
kind
of
terror
as
though
she
were
being
led
against
her
will
into
some
disgusting
chamber
where
the
skulls
were
stale
and
the
sights
indecent
she
saw
the
friendship
of
those
two
ellen
the
cook
and
her
father
young
inexperienced
though
she
was
she
was
old
already
in
a
certain
crude
knowledge
of
facts
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
traced
to
their
ultimate
the
relations
of
her
father
and
the
woman
but
in
some
relation
ugly
sordid
degraded
she
saw
those
two
figures
united
many
many
little
things
came
to
her
mind
as
she
sat
there
moments
when
the
cook
had
breathlessly
and
in
a
sudden
heat
betrayed
some
unexpected
agitation
moments
when
her
father
had
shown
confusion
moments
when
she
had
fancied
whispers
laughter
behind
walls
scurrying
feet
she
entwined
desperately
her
hands
together
as
pictures
developed
behind
her
eyes
ah
but
she
was
ashamed
most
bitterly
ashamed
the
rest
of
the
interview
came
to
her
only
dimly
she
knew
that
uncle
mathew
was
still
upon
his
feet
protesting
that
her
aunt
face
was
cold
and
wore
a
look
of
distressed
surprise
as
though
some
one
had
suddenly
been
rude
to
her
from
very
very
far
away
came
brassy
voice
i
was
aware
that
this
could
not
be
agreeable
miss
cardinal
but
i
am
afraid
that
under
the
circumstances
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
as
to
undue
influence
i
think
that
i
should
warn
you
cardinal
that
there
could
be
very
little
hope
and
of
course
the
expense
if
i
may
advise
you
the
voice
sank
away
again
the
room
faded
the
air
was
still
and
painted
like
figures
on
a
stage
acting
before
an
audience
of
one
maggie
saw
those
grotesque
persons
she
did
not
speak
one
word
during
the
whole
affair
after
a
time
she
saw
that
brassy
was
not
in
the
room
her
aunt
was
speaking
to
her
maggie
dear
i
so
very
sorry
so
very
sorry
but
you
know
that
you
will
come
to
us
and
find
a
home
there
you
must
think
about
the
money
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
arose
almost
brushing
her
aunt
aside
ah
that
not
it
that
not
it
she
cried
then
recovering
herself
a
little
she
went
on
it
all
right
aunt
anne
i
all
right
going
out
for
a
little
if
i
not
back
for
lunch
do
wait
something
cold
anything
tell
ellen
at
the
sudden
mention
of
that
name
she
stopped
coloured
a
little
turned
away
and
left
the
room
in
the
hall
she
nearly
ran
against
the
cook
the
woman
was
standing
there
motionless
breathing
deeply
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
when
she
saw
maggie
she
moved
as
though
she
would
speak
then
something
in
the
girl
face
checked
her
she
drew
back
into
the
shadow
maggie
left
the
house
the
brother
and
sister
remaining
in
the
room
walked
towards
one
another
as
though
driven
by
some
common
need
of
sympathy
and
protection
against
an
outside
power
mathew
cardinal
felt
a
genuine
indignation
that
had
but
seldom
figured
in
his
life
before
he
had
hated
his
brother
always
and
never
so
greatly
as
at
the
moments
of
the
reluctant
charity
towards
him
but
now
in
the
first
clean
uplift
of
his
indignation
there
was
no
at
the
justification
of
his
prophecies
i
knew
him
for
what
he
was
but
that
he
could
do
this
he
meant
it
to
hurt
too
that
was
like
him
all
over
he
had
us
in
his
mind
i
wish
i
never
taken
a
penny
from
him
i
rather
have
starved
yes
i
would
far
rather
i
been
bad
enough
but
never
a
thing
like
that
his
sister
said
quietly
he
dead
mathew
we
can
do
nothing
maggie
poor
child
he
approached
for
an
instant
more
nearly
than
he
had
ever
done
he
took
her
hand
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
it
good
of
you
anne
to
take
her
she
withdrew
her
hand
very
gently
i
wish
we
taken
her
before
she
must
have
had
a
terrible
time
here
i
never
realised
he
stood
away
from
her
near
the
window
feeling
suddenly
ashamed
of
his
impetuosity
she
a
strange
girl
anne
cardinal
went
on
she
did
seem
to
feel
this
or
anything
she
has
i
think
much
heart
i
afraid
she
may
find
it
a
little
difficult
with
us
mathew
was
uncomfortable
now
his
mood
had
changed
he
was
sullen
his
sister
always
made
him
feel
like
a
disgraced
dog
he
shuffled
on
his
feet
she
a
good
girl
he
muttered
at
last
and
then
with
a
confused
look
about
him
as
though
he
were
searching
for
something
he
stumbled
out
of
the
room
meanwhile
maggie
went
on
her
way
she
chose
instinctively
her
path
through
the
kitchen
garden
at
the
back
of
the
village
down
the
hill
by
the
village
street
over
the
little
bridge
that
crossed
the
rocky
stream
of
the
dreot
and
up
the
steep
hill
that
led
on
to
the
outskirts
of
rothin
moor
the
day
although
she
had
no
eyes
for
it
was
one
of
those
sudden
impulses
of
misty
warmth
that
surprise
the
glebeshire
frosts
the
long
stretch
of
the
moor
was
enwrapped
by
a
thin
silver
network
of
haze
the
warmth
of
the
sun
seen
so
dimly
that
it
was
like
a
shadow
reflected
in
a
mirror
struck
to
the
very
heart
of
the
soil
where
but
yesterday
there
had
been
iron
frost
there
was
now
soft
yielding
earth
it
was
as
though
the
heat
of
the
central
fires
of
the
world
pressed
dimly
upward
through
many
miles
of
heavy
weighted
resistance
straining
to
the
light
and
air
larks
lost
in
golden
mist
circled
in
space
maggie
could
feel
upon
her
face
and
neck
and
hands
the
warm
moisture
the
soil
under
her
feet
now
hard
now
soft
seemed
to
tremble
with
some
happy
anticipation
the
moor
wrapped
in
its
misty
colour
had
no
bounds
the
world
was
limitless
space
with
hidden
streams
hidden
suns
the
moor
had
a
pathetic
attraction
for
her
because
not
very
long
ago
a
man
and
a
woman
had
been
lost
only
a
few
steps
from
borhedden
farm
in
the
mist
lost
their
way
and
been
frozen
during
the
night
poor
things
lovers
perhaps
they
had
been
maggie
felt
that
here
she
could
walk
for
miles
and
miles
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
stop
her
the
clang
of
a
gate
a
house
a
wall
a
human
voice
was
intolerable
to
her
her
first
thought
as
she
went
forward
was
disgust
at
her
own
weakness
once
again
she
had
been
betrayed
by
her
feelings
she
could
remember
no
single
time
when
they
had
not
betrayed
her
she
recalled
now
with
an
intolerable
her
thoughts
of
her
father
at
the
time
of
the
funeral
and
the
hours
that
followed
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
she
had
only
softened
towards
his
memory
because
she
had
believed
that
he
had
left
her
money
and
now
when
she
saw
that
he
had
treated
her
contemptuously
she
found
him
once
again
the
cruel
mean
figure
that
she
had
before
thought
him
for
that
she
most
bitterly
with
an
intensity
that
only
her
loneliness
could
have
given
her
despised
herself
and
yet
something
else
in
her
knew
that
that
reproach
was
not
a
true
one
she
had
really
softened
towards
him
only
because
she
had
felt
that
she
had
behaved
badly
towards
him
and
the
discovery
now
that
he
had
behaved
badly
towards
her
did
not
alter
her
own
original
behaviour
she
did
not
analyse
all
this
she
only
knew
that
there
were
in
her
longings
for
affection
a
desire
to
be
loved
an
aching
for
companionship
and
that
these
things
must
always
be
kept
down
fast
hidden
within
her
she
realised
her
loneliness
now
with
a
fierce
proud
almost
exultant
independence
no
more
tears
no
more
leaning
upon
others
no
more
expecting
anything
from
anybody
she
was
not
dramatic
in
her
new
independence
she
did
not
cry
defiance
to
the
golden
mist
or
the
larks
or
the
hidden
sun
she
only
walked
on
and
on
stumping
forward
in
her
clumsy
boots
her
eyes
hard
and
unseeing
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
her
expectation
of
happiness
in
her
opening
life
that
had
been
so
strong
with
her
that
other
day
when
she
had
looked
down
upon
polchester
was
gone
she
expected
nothing
she
wanted
nothing
her
only
thought
was
that
she
would
never
yield
to
any
one
never
care
for
any
one
never
give
to
any
one
the
opportunity
of
touching
her
at
moments
through
the
mist
came
the
figure
of
the
cook
stout
florid
triumphant
maggie
regarded
her
contemptuously
you
can
not
touch
me
she
thought
of
her
father
she
would
never
think
again
with
both
hands
she
flung
all
her
memories
of
him
into
the
mist
to
be
lost
for
ever
she
came
suddenly
upon
a
lonely
she
knew
the
place
borhedden
it
had
often
been
a
favourite
walk
of
hers
from
the
vicarage
to
borhedden
the
farmer
let
rooms
there
and
because
the
house
was
very
old
some
of
the
rooms
were
fine
with
high
ceilings
thick
stone
walls
and
even
some
good
panelling
the
view
too
was
superb
across
to
the
broads
and
the
molecatcher
or
back
to
the
dreot
woods
or
to
the
dim
towers
of
polchester
cathedral
the
air
here
was
fine
one
of
the
healthiest
spots
in
glebeshire
the
farm
was
transfigured
by
the
misty
glow
cows
and
horses
could
be
faintly
seen
ricks
burnt
with
a
dim
fire
somewhere
dripping
water
falling
on
to
stone
gave
a
vocal
spirit
to
the
obscurity
the
warm
air
seemed
to
radiate
about
the
house
like
a
flame
that
is
obscured
by
sunlight
the
stealthy
movements
of
the
animals
the
dripping
of
the
water
were
the
only
sounds
to
maggie
the
house
seemed
to
say
something
something
comforting
and
reassuring
standing
there
she
registered
her
vow
that
through
all
her
life
she
would
care
for
no
one
no
one
should
touch
her
had
there
been
an
observer
he
might
have
found
some
food
for
his
irony
in
the
contemplation
of
that
small
insignificant
figure
so
ignorant
of
life
and
so
defiant
of
it
he
would
have
found
perhaps
something
pathetic
also
maggie
thought
neither
of
irony
nor
of
pathos
but
turned
homewards
with
her
mouth
set
her
eyes
grave
her
heart
controlled
as
she
walked
back
the
sun
broke
through
the
mist
and
turning
she
could
see
borhedden
like
a
house
on
fire
its
windows
blazing
against
the
sky
it
was
natural
that
her
aunt
should
wish
to
return
to
london
as
soon
as
possible
for
one
thing
ellen
the
cook
had
packed
her
clothes
and
retired
to
some
place
in
the
village
there
to
await
the
departure
of
the
defeated
family
then
the
house
was
not
only
unpleasant
by
reason
of
its
atmosphere
and
associations
but
there
were
also
the
definite
discomforts
of
roofs
through
which
the
rain
dripped
and
floors
that
swayed
beneath
one
tread
moreover
aunt
elizabeth
did
not
care
to
be
left
alone
in
the
london
house
uncle
mathew
left
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
he
had
one
little
last
conversation
with
maggie
i
hope
you
be
happy
in
london
he
said
i
hope
so
said
maggie
i
know
you
do
what
you
can
to
help
your
aunts
then
he
went
on
more
nervously
think
of
me
sometimes
i
sha
be
able
to
come
and
see
you
very
often
you
know
too
busy
but
i
shall
like
to
know
that
you
thinking
about
me
maggie
resolution
taken
so
defiantly
upon
the
moor
was
suddenly
severely
tested
she
felt
as
though
her
uncle
were
leaving
her
to
a
world
of
enemies
she
drove
down
her
sense
of
desolation
and
he
saw
nothing
but
her
quiet
composure
of
course
i
think
of
you
she
answered
and
you
must
come
often
they
do
like
me
he
said
nodding
his
head
towards
where
aunt
anne
might
be
supposed
to
be
waiting
it
not
my
fault
altogether
but
they
have
severe
ideas
it
religion
of
course
she
suddenly
seemed
to
see
in
his
eyes
some
terror
or
despair
as
though
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
drop
this
time
farther
than
ever
before
she
caught
his
arm
uncle
mathew
what
are
you
going
to
do
where
will
you
live
take
my
three
hundred
pounds
if
it
will
help
you
i
want
it
just
now
keep
it
for
me
he
had
a
moment
of
resolute
honesty
no
my
dear
if
i
had
it
it
would
go
in
a
week
i
ca
keep
money
i
never
could
really
better
without
any
i
all
right
you
never
get
rid
of
me
do
you
fear
we
got
more
in
common
than
you
think
although
you
a
good
girl
and
i
gone
to
pieces
a
bit
all
the
same
plenty
worse
than
me
your
aunt
for
all
her
religion
is
damned
difficult
for
a
plain
man
to
get
along
with
most
people
would
find
me
better
company
after
all
one
last
word
maggie
he
bent
down
and
whispered
to
her
do
you
go
getting
caught
by
that
sweep
who
runs
their
chapel
up
in
london
he
a
humbug
if
ever
there
was
one
you
mark
my
words
i
know
a
thing
or
two
he
done
your
aunts
a
lot
of
harm
and
he
have
his
dirty
fingers
on
you
if
you
let
him
so
he
departed
his
last
kiss
mingled
with
the
usual
aroma
of
whisky
and
tobacco
his
last
attitude
as
he
turned
away
that
strange
confusion
of
assumed
dignity
and
natural
genial
stupidity
that
was
so
especially
his
maggie
turned
with
all
her
new
defiant
resolution
to
face
the
world
alone
with
her
aunt
anne
throughout
the
next
day
she
was
busied
with
collecting
her
few
possessions
with
her
farewells
to
the
one
or
two
people
in
the
village
who
had
been
kind
to
her
and
with
little
sudden
almost
surreptitious
visits
to
corners
of
the
house
the
garden
the
wood
where
she
had
at
one
time
or
another
been
happy
as
the
evening
fell
and
a
sudden
storm
of
rain
leapt
up
from
beneath
the
hill
and
danced
about
the
house
she
had
a
wild
longing
to
stay
to
stay
at
any
cost
and
in
any
discomfort
london
had
no
longer
interest
but
only
terror
and
dismay
she
ran
out
into
the
dark
and
garden
felt
her
way
to
an
old
and
battered
seat
that
had
seen
in
older
days
dolls
and
the
ravages
of
stared
from
it
across
the
to
the
lights
of
the
village
that
seemed
to
rock
and
shiver
in
the
wind
and
rain
she
stared
passionately
at
the
lights
her
heart
beating
as
though
it
would
suffocate
her
at
last
her
clothes
soaked
with
the
storm
her
hair
dripping
she
returned
to
the
house
her
aunt
was
in
the
hall
my
dear
maggie
where
have
you
been
in
a
voice
that
was
kind
but
aghast
in
the
garden
said
maggie
hating
her
aunt
but
it
pouring
with
rain
you
soaking
you
must
change
at
once
did
you
go
out
to
find
something
maggie
made
no
answer
she
stood
there
her
face
sulky
and
closed
the
water
dripping
from
her
afterwards
as
she
changed
her
clothes
she
reflected
that
there
had
been
many
occasions
during
these
three
days
when
her
aunt
would
have
felt
irritation
with
her
had
she
known
her
longer
she
had
always
realised
that
she
was
careless
that
when
she
should
be
thinking
of
one
thing
she
thought
of
another
that
her
housekeeping
and
management
of
shops
and
servants
had
been
irregular
and
undisciplined
but
until
now
she
had
not
sharply
surveyed
her
weaknesses
since
the
coming
of
her
aunt
she
had
been
involved
in
a
perfect
network
of
little
blunders
she
had
gone
out
of
the
room
without
shutting
the
door
had
started
into
the
village
on
an
errand
and
then
when
she
was
there
had
forgotten
what
it
was
there
had
been
holes
in
her
stockings
and
rents
in
her
blouses
after
departure
she
had
endeavoured
to
help
in
the
kitchen
but
had
made
so
many
mistakes
that
aunt
anne
and
the
had
been
compelled
to
banish
her
she
now
wondered
how
during
so
many
years
she
had
run
the
house
at
all
but
then
her
father
had
cared
about
nothing
so
that
money
was
not
wasted
she
knew
that
aunt
anne
excused
her
mistakes
just
now
because
of
the
shock
of
her
father
death
and
the
events
that
followed
it
but
maggie
knew
also
that
these
faults
were
deep
in
her
character
she
could
explain
it
quite
simply
to
herself
by
saying
that
behind
the
things
that
she
saw
there
was
always
something
that
she
did
not
see
something
of
the
greatest
importance
and
just
beyond
her
vision
in
her
efforts
to
catch
this
farther
thing
she
forgot
what
was
immediately
in
front
of
her
it
had
always
been
so
since
a
tiny
child
she
had
always
supposed
that
the
shapes
and
forms
with
which
she
was
presented
were
only
masks
to
hide
the
real
thing
such
a
view
might
lend
interest
to
life
but
it
certainly
made
one
careless
and
although
uncle
mathew
might
understand
it
and
put
it
down
to
the
cardinal
imagination
she
instinctively
knew
that
aunt
anne
unless
maggie
definitely
attributed
it
to
religion
would
be
dismayed
and
even
if
it
persisted
angered
maggie
had
not
after
all
the
excuse
and
defence
of
being
a
dreamy
child
with
her
square
body
and
plain
face
her
clear
unspeculative
eyes
her
stolid
movements
she
could
have
no
claim
to
dreams
with
a
sudden
desolate
pang
maggie
suspected
that
uncle
mathew
was
the
only
person
who
would
ever
understand
her
well
then
she
must
train
herself
she
would
close
doors
turn
out
lights
put
things
back
where
she
found
them
mend
her
clothes
keep
accounts
indeed
a
new
life
was
beginning
for
her
she
felt
with
a
sudden
return
to
the
days
before
her
walk
on
the
moor
that
if
only
her
aunts
would
love
her
she
would
improve
much
more
rapidly
and
then
with
her
new
independence
she
assured
herself
that
if
they
did
not
love
her
she
most
certainly
would
not
love
them
that
night
she
sat
opposite
her
aunt
beside
the
fire
the
house
lay
dead
and
empty
behind
them
aunt
anne
was
so
neat
in
her
thin
black
silk
her
black
shining
hair
her
pale
pointed
face
a
little
round
white
locket
rising
and
falling
ever
so
slowly
with
the
lift
of
her
breast
there
were
white
frills
to
her
sleeves
and
she
read
a
slim
book
bound
in
purple
leather
her
body
never
moved
only
once
and
again
her
thin
delicate
hand
ever
so
gently
lifted
turned
a
page
then
settled
down
on
to
her
lap
once
more
she
never
raised
her
eyes
the
fire
was
heavy
and
sullen
the
wind
howled
that
old
familiar
beating
of
the
twigs
upon
the
pane
seemed
to
reiterate
to
maggie
that
this
was
her
last
evening
she
pretended
to
read
she
had
found
a
heavy
gilt
volume
of
paradise
lost
with
dore
pictures
she
read
these
words
beyond
this
flood
a
frozen
continent
lies
dark
and
wilde
beat
with
perpetual
storms
of
whirlwind
and
dire
hail
which
on
firm
land
thaws
not
but
gathers
heap
and
ruin
seems
of
ancient
pile
all
else
deep
snow
and
ice
a
gulf
profound
as
that
serbonian
bay
betwixt
damiata
and
mount
casius
old
where
armies
whole
have
sunk
the
parching
air
burns
froze
and
cold
performs
the
effect
of
fire
further
again
words
caught
her
eye
thus
roving
on
in
confused
march
forlorn
th
adventurous
bands
with
shuddering
horror
pale
and
eyes
aghast
viewed
first
their
lamentable
lot
and
found
no
rest
through
many
a
dark
and
drearie
vaile
they
passed
and
many
a
region
dolorous
many
a
frozen
many
a
fiery
alpe
rocks
caves
lakes
fens
bogs
dens
and
shades
of
death
a
universe
of
death
which
god
by
curse
created
evil
for
evil
only
good
where
all
life
dies
death
lives
and
nature
breaks
perverse
all
monstrous
all
prodigious
things
abominable
inutterable
and
worse
than
fables
yet
have
feigned
or
fear
conceived
gorgons
and
hydras
and
chimaeras
dire
she
did
not
care
for
reading
most
especially
she
did
not
care
for
poetry
but
she
saw
the
picture
up
to
the
very
bounds
of
the
house
this
waste
country
filled
with
beasts
of
prey
animals
with
fiery
eyes
and
incredible
names
the
long
stretch
of
snow
and
ice
the
black
water
with
no
stars
reflected
in
it
the
wind
a
coal
crashed
in
the
fire
she
gave
a
little
cry
my
dear
what
is
it
said
aunt
anne
then
with
a
little
shake
of
her
shoulders
she
added
there
a
horrid
draught
perhaps
you
forgot
to
close
the
when
you
came
away
maggie
dear
maggie
flushed
of
course
she
had
forgotten
she
left
the
room
crossed
the
hall
yes
there
was
the
door
wide
open
she
locked
it
the
place
was
utterly
cold
and
desolate
she
closed
the
door
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
little
hall
i
do
care
what
going
to
happen
she
cried
aloud
so
ended
her
life
in
that
house
chapter
iii
the
london
house
it
was
strange
after
this
that
the
start
on
the
london
journey
should
be
so
curiously
unexciting
it
was
perhaps
the
presence
of
aunt
anne
that
reduced
everything
to
an
unemotional
level
maggie
wondered
as
she
sat
in
the
old
cab
whether
her
aunt
anne
was
ever
moved
about
anything
then
something
occurred
that
showed
her
that
as
yet
she
knew
very
little
about
her
aunt
as
clamping
down
the
stony
hill
they
had
a
last
glimpse
at
the
corner
of
the
two
vicarage
chimneys
looking
above
the
high
hedge
like
a
pair
of
inquisitive
lunatics
maggie
choked
she
pressed
her
hands
together
pushed
her
hair
from
her
face
and
in
so
doing
touched
her
black
hat
your
hat
crooked
maggie
dear
said
her
aunt
gently
the
girl
hot
hands
clutched
the
soft
packet
of
sandwiches
and
a
little
black
handbag
that
yesterday
aunt
anne
had
bought
for
her
in
the
village
it
was
a
shabby
little
bag
and
had
strange
habits
of
opening
when
it
was
not
expected
to
do
so
and
remaining
shut
when
something
was
needed
from
it
it
gaped
now
and
just
as
the
cab
climbed
cator
hill
it
fell
forward
and
flung
the
contents
on
to
the
floor
maggie
blushing
looked
up
expecting
a
reproof
she
saw
that
her
aunt
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
view
as
upon
the
day
of
her
arrival
so
now
her
face
wore
a
look
of
rapture
she
drank
it
in
maggie
also
took
the
last
joy
of
the
familiar
scene
the
vicarage
like
a
grey
crouching
cat
lay
basking
on
the
green
hill
the
sunlight
flooded
the
dark
wood
galleons
of
clouds
rolled
like
lumbering
vessels
across
the
blue
sky
it
lovely
is
it
whispered
maggie
beautiful
beautiful
sighed
her
aunt
i
always
loved
just
this
view
i
often
walked
here
just
to
see
it
maggie
said
aunt
anne
sat
back
in
her
seat
it
been
hard
for
me
always
to
live
in
london
i
love
the
country
so
so
do
i
said
maggie
passionately
for
a
moment
they
were
together
caught
up
by
the
same
happiness
then
aunt
anne
said
why
your
bag
dear
the
things
are
all
about
the
place
maggie
bent
down
when
she
looked
up
again
they
had
dipped
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
maggie
had
only
once
in
all
her
life
been
in
a
train
but
on
this
present
occasion
she
did
not
find
it
very
thrilling
it
was
rather
like
being
in
anything
else
and
her
imagination
exercised
itself
upon
the
people
in
the
carriage
rather
than
the
scenery
outside
she
was
at
first
extremely
and
fancied
that
every
one
whispered
about
her
then
lulled
by
the
motion
of
the
train
and
the
warmth
she
slept
she
was
more
deeply
exhausted
by
the
events
of
the
last
week
than
she
knew
and
throughout
the
day
she
slumbered
woke
and
slumbered
again
quite
suddenly
she
awoke
with
a
definite
shock
to
a
new
world
evening
had
come
there
were
lights
that
rushed
up
to
the
train
stared
in
at
the
window
and
rushed
away
again
on
every
side
things
seemed
to
change
places
in
a
general
post
trees
and
houses
hedges
and
roads
all
lit
by
an
evening
moon
and
wrapt
in
a
white
and
wavering
mist
then
the
town
was
upon
them
quite
instantly
streets
ran
like
ribbons
into
grey
folds
of
buildings
rows
of
lamps
scattered
at
first
drew
into
a
single
point
of
dancing
flame
towers
and
chimneys
seemed
to
jump
from
place
to
place
as
though
they
were
trying
to
keep
in
time
with
the
train
a
bell
rang
monotonously
wreaths
of
smoke
rose
lazily
against
the
stars
and
fell
again
when
at
last
she
found
herself
a
tiny
figure
standing
upon
the
vast
platform
under
the
high
black
dome
the
noise
and
confusion
excited
and
delighted
her
she
rose
to
the
waves
of
sound
as
a
swimmer
rises
in
the
sea
her
heart
beat
fast
and
she
was
so
eagerly
engaged
in
looking
about
her
in
staring
at
the
hurrying
people
in
locating
the
shrill
screams
of
the
engines
in
determining
not
to
jump
when
the
carriages
jolted
together
that
her
little
black
bag
opened
unexpectedly
once
more
and
spilled
a
handkerchief
a
a
paper
packet
of
sweets
a
small
pair
of
scissors
and
a
shabby
brown
purse
upon
the
she
was
greatly
confused
when
an
old
gentleman
helped
her
to
pick
them
up
the
little
mirror
was
broken
oh
it
bad
luck
she
cried
staring
distressfully
at
the
old
man
he
smiled
and
would
have
certainly
been
very
agreeable
to
her
had
not
aunt
anne
who
had
been
finding
their
boxes
and
securing
a
cab
arrived
and
taken
maggie
away
you
should
speak
to
strange
gentlemen
dear
said
aunt
anne
but
maggie
did
not
listen
it
was
characteristic
of
anne
cardinal
that
she
should
secure
the
only
in
the
station
rejecting
the
that
waited
in
rows
for
her
pleasure
had
maggie
only
known
her
aunt
choice
was
eloquent
of
their
future
life
together
but
maggie
did
not
know
and
did
not
care
her
excitement
was
intense
that
old
dreot
life
had
already
swung
so
far
behind
her
that
it
was
like
a
fantastic
dream
as
they
rumbled
through
the
streets
the
cries
the
smells
the
lights
seemed
arranged
especially
for
her
she
could
not
believe
that
they
had
all
been
just
like
this
before
her
arrival
as
with
everything
she
was
busy
imagining
the
world
behind
this
display
the
invisible
circle
inside
the
circle
that
she
saw
they
came
into
the
strand
and
the
masses
of
moving
people
seemed
to
her
like
somnambulists
walking
without
reason
or
purpose
she
felt
as
though
there
would
suddenly
come
a
great
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
street
into
which
the
cab
would
tumble
the
noise
seemed
to
her
country
ears
deafening
and
when
suddenly
the
lighted
letters
of
some
advertisement
flashed
out
gigantic
against
the
sky
she
gave
a
little
scream
she
puzzled
her
aunt
by
saying
but
it
is
really
like
this
is
it
to
which
aunt
anne
could
only
say
you
hungry
and
tired
dear
i
expect
with
one
last
outrending
scream
the
whole
world
seemed
to
fling
itself
at
the
window
open
because
aunt
anne
thought
the
cab
had
a
smell
oosh
o
o
s
oosh
maggie
drew
back
as
though
she
expected
some
one
to
leap
in
upon
them
then
with
that
marvellous
and
ironical
gift
of
contrast
that
is
london
secret
they
were
suddenly
driven
into
the
sleepiest
quiet
they
stumbled
up
a
street
that
was
like
a
cave
for
misty
darkness
and
muffled
echoes
the
cab
wheels
made
a
riotous
clatter
a
man
posting
a
letter
in
a
was
the
only
figure
in
the
street
the
stars
shone
overhead
with
wonderful
brilliance
and
a
little
bell
jangled
softly
close
at
hand
all
the
houses
were
tall
and
secret
with
high
white
steps
and
flat
faces
a
cat
slipped
across
the
street
another
swiftly
followed
it
dreot
seemed
near
at
hand
again
and
ellen
the
cook
not
so
far
away
maggie
felt
a
sudden
forlornness
and
desolation
what
a
very
quiet
street
she
whispered
as
though
she
were
afraid
lest
the
street
should
hear
they
stopped
before
one
of
the
houses
aunt
anne
rang
the
bell
and
an
old
woman
with
a
face
like
a
lemon
helped
the
cabman
with
the
boxes
maggie
was
standing
in
a
hall
that
smelt
of
damp
and
geraniums
it
was
intensely
dark
and
a
shrill
scream
from
somewhere
did
not
make
things
more
pleasant
that
edward
the
parrot
said
aunt
anne
take
care
not
to
approach
him
too
closely
dear
because
he
bites
then
they
went
upstairs
maggie
groping
her
way
and
stumbling
at
the
sharp
corners
the
darkness
grew
she
knocked
her
knee
on
the
corner
of
something
cried
out
and
a
suddenly
opened
door
threw
a
pale
green
light
upon
a
big
picture
of
men
in
armour
attacking
a
fortified
town
beneath
a
thundery
sky
this
picture
wavered
and
faltered
hung
as
it
was
upon
a
thin
cord
strained
to
maggie
reached
the
security
of
the
room
beyond
the
passage
her
shoulders
bent
a
little
as
though
she
expected
to
near
at
every
instant
the
crashing
collapse
of
the
armoured
men
her
eyes
unused
to
the
light
she
stumbled
into
the
room
fell
into
some
one
arms
felt
that
her
poor
hat
was
crooked
and
her
cheeks
burning
and
then
was
rebuked
as
it
seemed
by
the
piercing
cry
of
edward
the
parrot
from
the
very
bowels
of
the
house
she
stammered
something
to
the
man
who
had
held
her
and
then
let
her
go
she
was
confused
hot
and
angry
they
think
me
an
idiot
who
ca
enter
a
room
properly
she
glared
about
her
and
felt
as
though
she
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
some
strange
people
who
lived
under
the
sea
she
was
aware
when
her
eyes
were
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
that
the
entrance
of
herself
and
her
aunt
had
interrupted
the
conversation
of
three
people
near
the
fireplace
sat
a
little
woman
wearing
black
mittens
and
a
white
lace
cap
standing
above
her
with
his
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
was
a
thin
gentleman
with
large
spectacles
high
gaunt
features
and
a
very
thin
head
of
hair
near
the
door
was
the
man
against
whom
maggie
had
collided
she
saw
that
he
was
young
and
restless
she
noticed
even
then
his
eyes
bright
and
laughing
as
though
he
were
immensely
amused
his
mouth
opened
and
closed
again
his
eyes
were
never
still
and
he
made
fierce
dumb
protests
with
his
body
jerking
it
forward
pulling
it
back
as
a
rider
strives
to
restrain
an
unruly
horse
maggie
was
able
to
notice
these
things
because
during
the
first
moments
her
aunt
anne
entirely
held
the
stage
she
advanced
to
the
fireplace
with
her
halting
movement
embraced
the
little
lady
by
the
fire
with
a
soft
and
unimpassioned
clasp
well
elizabeth
here
we
are
you
see
turned
to
the
thin
gentleman
saying
why
you
magnus
i
thought
that
you
were
still
in
wiltshire
then
from
the
middle
of
the
room
addressing
the
stout
young
man
i
very
glad
to
see
you
mr
warlock
maggie
fancied
that
the
three
persons
were
nervous
of
her
aunt
the
stout
young
man
was
amused
perhaps
at
the
general
situation
but
magnus
by
the
fireplace
showed
great
emotion
the
colour
mounting
into
his
high
bony
cheeks
and
his
nostrils
twitching
like
a
horse
maggie
had
been
always
very
observant
and
she
was
detached
enough
now
to
notice
that
the
was
filled
with
ugly
and
cumbrous
things
and
yet
seemed
unfurnished
although
everything
was
old
and
had
been
there
obviously
for
years
the
place
yet
reminded
one
of
a
bare
chamber
into
which
furniture
had
just
been
piled
without
order
or
arrangement
opposite
the
door
was
a
large
and
very
bad
painting
of
the
two
sisters
as
young
girls
sitting
with
arms
encircled
in
low
dresses
on
the
seashore
before
a
grey
and
angry
sea
and
uncle
mathew
as
a
small
boy
in
tight
short
blue
trousers
carrying
a
bucket
and
spade
and
a
smug
pious
expression
the
room
was
lit
with
gas
that
sizzled
and
hissed
in
a
protesting
undertone
there
was
a
big
black
cat
near
the
fire
and
this
watched
maggie
with
green
and
fiery
eyes
she
stood
there
by
the
door
tired
and
hungry
she
felt
unacknowledged
and
forgotten
i
know
i
shall
hate
it
was
her
thought
she
was
conscious
of
her
arms
and
her
legs
her
ankle
tickled
in
her
shoe
and
she
longed
to
scratch
it
she
sneezed
suddenly
and
they
all
jumped
as
though
the
floor
had
opened
beneath
them
and
maggie
said
the
little
lady
by
the
fireplace
maggie
moved
forward
with
the
awkward
gestures
and
the
angry
look
in
her
eyes
that
were
always
hers
when
she
was
ill
at
ease
maggie
said
aunt
anne
has
been
very
good
and
she
tired
i
sure
continued
the
little
lady
who
must
of
course
be
aunt
elizabeth
the
journey
was
easy
dear
and
you
had
no
change
they
gave
you
footwarmers
i
hope
it
been
lovely
weather
i
so
glad
to
see
you
dear
i
had
no
photograph
of
you
since
you
were
a
baby
aunt
elizabeth
had
a
way
maggie
thought
of
collecting
a
number
of
little
disconnected
statements
as
though
she
were
working
out
a
sum
and
hoped
but
was
not
very
certain
that
she
would
achieve
a
successful
answer
add
two
and
five
and
three
and
four
the
statements
that
she
made
were
apparently
worlds
apart
in
interest
and
importance
but
she
hoped
with
good
fortune
to
flash
upon
the
boards
a
fine
result
she
was
nervous
maggie
saw
and
her
thin
shoulders
were
a
little
bent
as
though
she
expected
some
one
from
behind
to
strike
her
suddenly
in
the
small
of
the
back
she
afraid
of
something
thought
maggie
aunt
elizabeth
had
obviously
not
the
strong
character
of
her
sister
anne
thank
you
said
maggie
looking
for
no
reason
at
all
at
magnus
i
slept
in
the
train
so
i
not
tired
she
stopped
then
because
there
was
nothing
more
to
say
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
kiss
her
aunt
she
thought
she
saw
in
her
aunt
small
rather
watery
eyes
an
appeal
that
she
should
do
so
the
distance
however
seemed
infinite
and
maggie
had
a
strange
feeling
that
her
bending
down
would
break
some
spell
that
the
picture
in
the
passage
would
fall
with
a
ghostly
clatter
that
edward
the
parrot
would
scream
and
shriek
that
the
gas
would
burst
into
a
bubbling
horror
that
the
big
black
cat
would
leap
upon
her
and
tear
her
with
its
claws
well
i
not
afraid
she
thought
and
as
though
she
were
defying
the
universe
she
bent
down
and
kissed
her
aunt
she
fancied
that
this
act
of
hers
produced
a
little
sigh
of
relief
every
one
seemed
to
settle
down
they
all
sat
and
conversation
was
general
magnus
had
a
rather
melancholy
deprecating
voice
but
with
some
touch
of
irony
too
as
though
he
were
used
to
being
called
a
fool
by
his
but
after
all
knew
better
than
they
did
he
did
not
sound
at
all
conceited
only
amused
with
a
little
gentle
melancholy
at
his
own
position
i
glad
to
see
you
so
well
miss
cardinal
he
said
with
an
air
of
rather
courtesy
i
had
been
afraid
that
it
might
have
exhausted
you
i
only
came
to
welcome
you
i
must
return
at
once
i
have
an
article
to
finish
before
midnight
aunt
anne
smiled
gently
no
i
not
tired
thank
you
and
what
has
happened
while
i
have
been
away
i
have
been
away
too
as
you
know
said
magnus
but
i
understand
that
your
sister
has
been
very
busy
quite
a
number
aunt
elizabeth
said
in
her
trembling
voice
no
no
anne
i
assure
you
nothing
at
all
as
you
know
the
bible
committee
wanted
to
discuss
the
new
scheme
last
tuesday
warlock
simms
young
holliday
miss
martin
mary
hearst
and
sophie
dunn
and
turner
nothing
at
all
it
was
a
wet
day
last
tuesday
afternoon
your
mother
is
quite
well
i
hope
mr
warlock
said
aunt
anne
turning
to
the
young
man
yes
she
all
right
he
answered
just
the
same
amy
wants
you
to
go
and
see
her
i
was
to
give
you
the
message
if
you
could
manage
sometime
or
she
come
here
if
it
more
convenient
there
something
important
she
says
but
i
do
suppose
it
important
in
the
least
you
know
what
she
is
he
spoke
laughing
his
eyes
wandered
all
round
the
room
and
suddenly
settled
on
maggie
with
a
startled
stare
as
though
she
were
the
last
person
whom
he
had
expected
to
find
there
yes
afternoon
perhaps
about
three
if
that
would
suit
her
how
is
amy
oh
she
all
right
as
eager
to
run
the
world
as
ever
and
she
never
will
run
it
so
long
as
she
shows
her
cards
as
obviously
as
she
does
i
tell
her
so
but
it
no
good
she
does
listen
to
me
you
know
aunt
anne
with
the
incomparable
way
that
she
had
brushed
all
this
very
gently
aside
she
simply
said
i
glad
that
she
well
then
she
turned
to
the
other
gentleman
your
writing
quite
satisfactory
i
hope
mr
magnus
she
spoke
as
though
it
had
been
a
cold
or
a
toothache
he
smiled
his
melancholy
ironical
smile
i
go
on
you
know
miss
cardinal
after
all
it
my
bread
and
butter
maggie
looking
at
him
knew
that
this
was
exactly
the
way
that
he
did
not
regard
it
and
felt
a
sudden
sympathy
towards
him
with
his
thin
hair
his
large
spectacles
and
his
shabby
clothes
but
her
look
at
him
was
the
last
thing
of
which
she
was
properly
conscious
the
wall
beyond
the
fireplace
that
had
seemed
before
to
her
dim
and
dark
now
suddenly
appeared
to
lurch
forward
to
bulge
before
her
eyes
the
floor
with
its
old
rather
shabby
carpet
rose
on
a
slant
as
though
it
was
rocked
by
an
unsteady
sea
worst
of
all
the
large
black
cat
swelled
like
a
balloon
its
whiskers
distended
like
wire
she
knew
that
her
eyes
were
burning
that
her
forehead
was
cold
and
that
she
felt
sick
she
was
hungry
and
at
the
same
time
was
conscious
that
she
could
eat
nothing
her
only
wish
was
to
creep
away
and
hide
herself
from
every
one
however
through
all
her
confusion
she
was
aware
of
her
determination
not
to
betray
to
them
that
she
was
if
only
the
cat
would
grow
so
fast
i
believe
i
could
manage
was
her
desperate
thought
there
was
a
roaring
in
her
ears
she
caught
suddenly
from
an
infinite
distance
the
voice
of
the
stout
young
man
she
ill
she
fainting
she
was
aware
that
she
struggled
to
face
him
with
fierce
protesting
eyes
the
next
thing
she
knew
was
that
she
lay
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
in
his
arms
she
felt
that
he
laid
her
clumsily
but
gently
upon
the
sofa
some
one
sprinkled
cold
water
on
her
forehead
deep
down
in
her
soul
she
hated
and
despised
herself
for
this
weakness
before
strangers
she
closed
her
eyes
tightly
desiring
to
conceal
not
so
much
the
others
as
herself
from
her
scornful
gaze
she
heard
some
one
say
something
about
a
cup
of
tea
and
she
wanted
it
suddenly
with
a
desperate
fiery
desire
but
she
would
not
speak
no
not
if
they
were
to
torture
her
with
thirst
for
days
and
days
to
that
extent
at
least
she
could
preserve
her
independence
she
heard
her
aunt
elizabeth
say
something
like
poor
thing
strain
last
week
father
too
much
she
gathered
all
her
energies
together
to
say
it
has
been
too
much
i
all
right
but
they
brought
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
before
that
she
succumbed
she
drank
it
with
eager
greed
then
lay
back
her
eyes
closed
and
slowly
the
bars
of
hot
iron
withdrew
from
her
forehead
she
slept
she
woke
to
a
room
wrapped
in
a
green
trembling
twilight
she
was
alone
save
for
the
black
cat
the
fire
crackled
the
gas
was
turned
low
and
the
london
murmur
beyond
the
window
was
like
the
hum
of
an
organ
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
she
felt
as
she
lay
there
an
increasing
irritation
at
her
weakness
she
was
afraid
too
for
her
future
did
she
faint
like
this
at
the
earliest
opportunity
people
would
allow
her
no
chance
of
earning
her
living
where
was
that
fine
independent
life
upon
which
outside
borhedden
farm
she
had
resolved
and
these
people
her
aunts
the
young
man
the
thin
spectacled
man
what
would
they
think
of
her
they
would
name
it
affectation
perhaps
and
imagine
that
she
had
acted
in
such
a
way
that
she
might
gain
their
interest
and
sympathy
such
a
thought
sent
the
colour
flaming
to
her
cheeks
she
sat
up
on
the
sofa
she
would
go
to
them
at
once
and
show
them
that
she
was
perfectly
strong
and
well
the
door
opened
and
aunt
elizabeth
came
in
very
gently
as
though
she
were
going
to
steal
something
she
was
maggie
saw
now
so
little
as
to
be
almost
deformed
with
a
soft
pale
face
lined
and
wrinkled
and
blue
watery
eyes
she
wore
a
black
silk
wrapper
over
her
shoulders
and
soft
black
slippers
alice
in
wonderland
was
one
of
the
few
books
that
maggie
had
read
in
her
childhood
aunt
elizabeth
reminded
her
strongly
of
the
white
queen
in
the
second
part
of
that
masterpiece
oh
you
not
asleep
dear
said
aunt
elizabeth
no
i
not
said
maggie
i
perfectly
all
right
i
ca
think
what
made
me
behave
like
that
i
never
done
such
a
thing
before
ashamed
it
was
very
natural
said
aunt
elizabeth
you
should
have
had
some
tea
at
once
it
was
my
fault
it
late
now
nine
my
sister
suggests
bed
supper
in
bed
very
nice
i
always
think
after
a
long
journey
it
will
be
fine
i
expect
we
had
beautiful
weather
until
this
morning
when
it
rained
for
an
hour
chicken
and
some
pudding
there
a
little
australian
wine
that
my
sister
keeps
in
the
house
for
accidents
i
liked
it
myself
when
i
had
it
once
for
severe
neuralgia
she
suddenly
with
a
gesture
put
out
her
hand
and
took
maggie
her
hand
was
soft
like
it
had
apparently
no
bones
in
it
maggie
was
touched
and
grateful
she
liked
this
little
shy
frightened
woman
she
would
do
anything
to
please
her
do
think
she
said
eagerly
that
i
ever
fainted
like
that
before
i
assure
you
that
i
never
done
anything
so
silly
you
must
think
that
i
not
strong
i
strong
as
a
horse
father
always
said
so
i
come
to
help
you
and
aunt
anne
in
any
way
i
can
you
must
think
that
i
going
to
be
in
the
way
i
only
want
to
be
useful
aunt
elizabeth
started
and
looked
at
the
door
i
thought
i
heard
something
she
said
they
both
listened
perhaps
it
was
the
parrot
said
maggie
aunt
elizabeth
smiled
bravely
there
are
often
noises
in
an
old
house
like
this
she
said
the
black
cat
came
towards
them
slowly
with
immense
dignified
indifference
he
swung
his
tail
as
though
to
show
them
that
he
cared
for
no
one
he
walked
to
the
door
and
waited
then
followed
them
out
of
the
room
maggie
found
that
her
bedroom
was
a
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
very
white
and
clean
with
a
smell
of
soot
and
tallow
candle
that
was
new
and
attractive
there
was
a
large
text
in
bright
purple
over
the
bed
the
lord
cometh
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
from
the
window
one
saw
roofs
towers
chimneys
a
sweeping
arc
of
now
spun
and
sparkled
into
pathways
and
out
again
driven
by
the
rumble
behind
them
that
never
ceased
although
muffled
by
the
closed
window
they
talked
together
for
a
little
while
standing
near
the
window
the
candle
wavering
in
aunt
elizabeth
unsteady
hand
we
thought
you
like
this
top
room
it
quieter
than
the
rest
of
the
house
sometimes
when
the
sweep
has
been
the
soot
tumbles
down
the
chimney
you
must
mind
that
thomas
will
push
open
the
door
and
walk
in
at
times
it
his
way
thomas
said
maggie
bewildered
our
cat
he
has
been
with
us
for
many
years
now
those
who
know
say
that
he
might
have
taken
prizes
once
i
ca
tell
i
sure
if
you
pull
that
bell
when
you
want
anything
martha
will
come
she
will
call
you
at
seven
prayers
are
in
the
at
a
quarter
past
eight
sometimes
the
wind
blows
through
the
but
it
is
only
the
wind
maggie
drew
back
the
curtains
that
hid
the
glitter
of
the
lights
were
those
great
friends
of
yours
those
gentlemen
this
evening
the
one
who
wears
spectacles
magnus
yes
he
is
a
very
old
friend
he
is
devoted
to
my
sister
he
writes
stories
what
in
the
papers
no
in
books
two
every
year
and
the
other
one
that
is
young
warlock
he
is
the
son
of
our
minister
does
he
live
near
here
he
lives
just
now
with
his
parents
of
late
years
he
has
been
abroad
he
does
look
like
the
son
of
a
minister
said
maggie
no
i
afraid
aunt
elizabeth
suddenly
stopped
his
father
has
been
minister
of
our
chapel
for
twenty
years
he
is
a
great
and
wonderful
man
where
is
the
chapel
very
near
at
hand
you
will
see
it
is
sunday
there
was
a
long
pause
maggie
knew
that
now
was
the
time
when
she
should
say
something
friendly
and
affectionate
she
could
say
nothing
she
stared
at
her
aunt
then
at
a
long
mirror
that
faced
her
bed
then
at
the
lighted
sky
she
felt
warmly
grateful
eager
to
show
all
the
world
that
she
would
do
her
best
that
she
was
ready
to
give
herself
to
this
new
life
with
all
her
soul
and
strength
she
could
say
nothing
they
waited
at
last
her
aunt
said
dear
maggie
aunt
elizabeth
she
stole
away
leaving
the
candle
upon
the
chest
of
drawers
the
cat
followed
her
swinging
his
tail
left
alone
maggie
felt
the
whole
sweep
of
her
excitement
she
was
exhausted
her
body
felt
as
though
it
had
been
trampled
upon
she
was
so
tired
that
she
could
scarcely
drag
her
clothes
from
her
but
the
exaltation
of
her
spirit
was
beyond
and
above
all
this
half
undressed
she
stood
before
the
long
mirror
she
had
never
before
possessed
a
long
and
now
she
seemed
to
see
herself
as
she
really
was
for
the
first
time
was
she
very
ugly
and
unattractive
yes
she
must
be
with
that
stumpy
body
those
thick
legs
and
arms
that
short
nose
and
large
mouth
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
to
herself
to
make
herself
attractive
other
girls
knew
but
she
had
never
had
any
one
who
could
tell
her
perhaps
she
would
make
girl
friends
now
who
would
show
her
but
after
all
she
did
not
care
she
was
herself
people
who
did
not
like
her
could
leave
her
yes
they
could
and
she
would
not
stir
a
finger
to
fetch
them
back
then
deep
down
in
her
soul
she
knew
that
she
wanted
success
a
magnificent
life
a
great
future
nay
more
she
expected
it
she
had
force
and
strength
and
she
would
compel
life
to
give
her
what
she
wanted
she
laughed
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
was
happy
almost
triumphant
and
for
no
reason
at
all
she
went
to
her
windows
and
opened
them
there
came
up
to
her
the
tramping
progress
of
the
they
advanced
like
elephants
charging
down
a
jungle
nearer
nearer
nearer
before
the
tramp
of
one
had
passed
another
was
advancing
and
then
upon
that
another
ceaselessly
advancing
and
retreating
in
her
nightdress
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
poised
as
it
seemed
to
her
above
a
swaying
carpet
of
lights
life
seemed
to
hold
every
promise
in
store
for
her
she
crossed
to
her
bed
drew
the
clothes
about
her
and
forgetting
her
supper
forgetting
all
that
had
happened
to
her
her
journey
her
fainting
the
young
man
edward
the
parrot
she
fell
into
a
slumber
as
deep
as
secure
as
death
itself
chapter
iv
the
chapel
maggie
woke
next
morning
to
a
strange
silence
many
were
the
silent
mornings
that
had
greeted
her
at
dreots
but
this
was
silence
with
a
difference
it
was
the
silence
she
was
instantly
aware
of
some
one
whose
very
soul
was
noise
and
tumult
she
listened
and
the
sudden
chirping
of
some
sparrows
beyond
her
window
only
accentuated
the
sense
of
expectation
she
had
never
in
all
her
days
been
so
conscious
of
sunday
she
was
almost
afraid
to
move
lest
she
should
break
the
spell
she
lay
in
bed
and
thought
of
the
preceding
evening
her
fainting
fit
seemed
to
her
now
more
than
ever
unfortunate
it
had
placed
her
at
a
disadvantage
with
them
all
she
could
imagine
the
stout
young
man
returning
to
his
home
and
saying
their
niece
has
arrived
seems
a
weak
little
thing
fainted
right
off
there
in
the
or
her
aunts
saying
anxiously
to
one
another
well
i
did
know
she
was
as
delicate
as
that
i
hope
she
wo
be
always
ill
and
she
delicate
no
one
stronger
she
had
never
fainted
before
the
silliness
of
it
the
next
thing
that
disturbed
her
was
the
comfort
and
arrangement
of
everything
certainly
the
had
not
been
very
orderly
full
of
old
things
badly
placed
but
this
bedroom
was
clean
and
tidy
and
the
supper
last
night
so
neat
on
its
tray
with
everything
that
she
could
want
she
could
feel
the
order
and
discipline
of
the
whole
house
and
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
been
either
orderly
or
disciplined
she
had
never
been
brought
up
to
be
so
how
could
you
be
orderly
when
there
were
holes
in
the
bedroom
ceiling
and
the
kitchen
floor
holes
that
your
father
would
never
trouble
to
have
mended
her
aunts
would
wish
her
to
help
in
the
house
and
she
would
forget
things
there
passed
before
her
in
that
sunday
quiet
a
terrible
procession
of
the
things
that
she
would
forget
she
knew
that
she
would
not
be
patient
under
correction
especially
under
the
correction
of
her
aunt
anne
already
she
felt
in
her
a
rebellion
at
her
aunt
aloofness
and
passivity
after
all
why
should
she
treat
every
one
as
though
she
were
god
maggie
felt
that
there
was
in
her
aunt
attitude
something
sentimental
and
affected
she
hated
sentiment
and
affectation
in
any
one
she
was
afraid
too
that
anne
bullied
aunt
elizabeth
maggie
was
sorry
for
aunt
elizabeth
but
with
all
the
arrogance
of
the
young
a
little
despised
her
why
did
she
tremble
and
start
like
that
she
should
stand
up
for
herself
and
not
mind
what
her
sister
said
to
her
finally
there
was
something
about
the
house
for
which
maggie
could
not
quite
account
some
uneasiness
or
expectation
as
though
one
knew
that
there
was
some
one
behind
the
door
and
was
therefore
afraid
to
open
it
it
may
have
been
simply
london
that
was
behind
it
maggie
was
ready
to
attribute
anything
to
the
influence
of
that
tremendous
power
but
her
own
final
impression
was
that
the
people
in
this
house
had
for
too
long
a
time
been
brooding
over
something
it
would
do
my
aunts
a
lot
of
good
to
move
somewhere
else
she
said
to
herself
as
aunt
anne
loves
the
country
so
much
i
ca
think
why
she
does
live
there
there
were
many
things
that
she
was
to
learn
before
the
end
of
the
day
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
little
whirr
and
clatter
which
thin
and
distant
though
it
was
penetrated
into
her
room
the
whirr
was
followed
by
the
voice
clear
and
cheerful
of
a
cuckoo
maggie
was
in
an
instant
out
of
bed
into
the
passage
and
standing
in
her
nightdress
before
a
high
old
that
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
wooden
bird
looking
down
at
her
in
friendly
fashion
cuckooed
eight
times
flapped
his
wings
at
her
and
disappeared
it
is
a
sufficient
witness
to
maggie
youth
and
inexperience
that
she
was
enraptured
by
this
event
it
was
not
only
that
she
had
never
seen
a
before
she
had
for
that
matter
never
heard
of
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
it
gave
her
greater
happiness
than
any
bare
mechanical
discovery
could
have
done
the
bird
seemed
to
have
come
to
her
in
the
friendliest
way
to
remove
some
of
the
chilly
passivity
of
the
house
her
greatest
fear
since
her
arrival
had
been
that
this
was
a
house
in
which
nothing
was
ever
going
to
happen
and
that
she
would
never
get
out
of
it
it
will
be
just
as
it
has
been
all
my
life
seeing
nothing
doing
nothing
only
instead
of
father
it
will
be
the
aunts
the
bird
seemed
to
promise
her
adventure
and
excitement
to
most
people
it
would
have
been
only
a
further
sign
of
an
household
far
behind
the
times
to
maggie
it
was
thrilling
and
encouraging
he
would
remind
her
every
hour
of
the
day
of
the
possibility
of
fun
in
a
world
that
was
full
of
surprises
she
heard
suddenly
a
step
behind
her
and
a
dry
voice
saying
your
hot
water
miss
maggie
she
turned
round
blushing
at
being
caught
staring
up
at
a
like
a
baby
in
her
nightdress
to
face
the
wrinkled
old
woman
who
the
night
before
had
brought
her
with
a
grudging
countenance
her
supper
maggie
had
thought
then
that
this
old
martha
did
not
like
her
and
resented
the
extra
work
that
her
stay
in
the
house
involved
she
was
now
more
than
ever
sure
of
that
dislike
i
thought
i
was
to
be
called
at
seven
eight
on
sundays
said
the
old
woman
i
hope
you
better
this
morning
miss
maggie
felt
this
to
be
deeply
ironical
and
flushed
i
quite
well
thank
you
she
said
stiffly
what
time
is
breakfast
on
sundays
the
rings
at
a
quarter
to
nine
miss
they
exchanged
no
more
conversation
at
a
quarter
to
nine
a
shrill
jangling
bell
rang
out
and
maggie
hurried
down
the
dark
staircase
she
did
not
know
where
the
was
but
by
good
chance
she
caught
sight
of
aunt
elizabeth
little
body
moving
hurriedly
down
the
passage
and
hastened
after
her
she
arrived
only
just
in
time
there
standing
in
a
row
before
four
chairs
their
faces
red
and
shining
their
hands
folded
in
front
of
them
were
the
domestics
there
with
a
little
high
desk
in
front
of
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
long
table
was
aunt
anne
here
near
the
door
were
two
chairs
obviously
intended
for
aunt
elizabeth
and
maggie
maggie
in
her
haste
pushed
the
door
and
it
banged
loudly
behind
her
in
the
silent
room
the
noise
echoed
through
the
house
it
was
followed
by
a
piercing
scream
from
edward
whom
maggie
concluded
it
had
awakened
all
this
confused
her
very
much
and
gave
her
anything
but
a
religious
state
of
mind
what
followed
resembled
very
much
the
ceremonies
with
which
her
father
had
been
accustomed
to
begin
the
day
except
that
her
father
with
one
eye
on
the
bacon
had
gabbled
at
frantic
pace
through
the
prayers
and
aunt
anne
read
them
very
slowly
and
with
great
beauty
she
read
from
the
gospel
of
john
these
things
i
command
you
that
ye
love
one
another
but
the
clear
sweet
tones
of
her
voice
gave
no
conviction
of
a
love
for
mankind
maggie
looking
from
that
pale
remote
face
to
the
roughened
cheeks
and
plump
body
of
the
felt
that
here
there
could
be
no
possible
bond
when
they
knelt
down
she
was
conscious
as
she
had
been
since
she
was
a
tiny
child
of
two
things
the
upturned
heels
of
the
servants
boots
and
the
discomfort
to
her
own
knees
these
two
facts
had
always
hindered
her
religious
devotions
and
they
hindered
them
now
there
had
always
been
to
her
something
irresistibly
comic
in
those
upturned
heels
the
dull
flat
surfaces
of
these
cheap
shoes
in
the
there
were
the
signs
of
wear
martha
were
new
and
shining
the
were
smart
and
probably
creaked
abominably
the
bodies
above
them
sniffed
and
rustled
and
sighed
the
vacant
stupid
faces
of
the
shoes
were
aunt
anne
only
audience
maggie
wondered
what
the
owners
of
those
shoes
felt
about
the
house
had
they
a
sense
of
irritation
too
or
did
they
perhaps
think
about
nothing
at
all
save
their
food
their
pay
and
their
young
man
or
their
night
out
the
pain
to
her
knees
pierced
her
thoughts
the
prayers
were
very
long
aunt
anne
beautiful
voice
was
interminable
breakfast
was
quiet
and
silent
edward
who
received
apparently
a
larger
meal
on
sundays
than
at
ordinary
times
chattered
happily
to
himself
and
maggie
heard
him
say
complacently
poor
parrot
poor
parrot
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
service
is
at
eleven
dear
said
aunt
anne
we
leave
the
house
at
ten
minutes
to
eleven
maggie
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
the
hour
in
front
of
her
went
up
to
her
bedroom
found
the
servant
making
the
bed
came
down
into
the
and
sat
in
a
dark
corner
under
a
large
bead
mat
that
nailed
to
the
wall
gave
little
taps
and
rustlings
as
though
it
were
trying
to
escape
she
felt
that
she
should
be
doing
something
but
what
she
sat
there
straining
her
ear
for
sounds
one
always
seems
to
be
expecting
some
one
in
this
house
she
thought
the
weather
that
had
been
bright
had
now
changed
and
little
gusts
of
rain
beat
upon
the
windows
she
thought
with
a
sudden
strange
warmth
of
uncle
mathew
what
was
he
doing
where
was
he
how
pleasant
it
would
be
were
he
suddenly
to
walk
into
that
chilly
dark
room
she
would
not
show
him
that
she
was
lonely
but
she
would
give
him
such
a
welcome
as
he
had
never
had
from
her
before
had
he
money
enough
was
he
feeling
perhaps
as
desolate
amongst
strangers
as
she
the
rain
tickled
the
maggie
with
a
desolation
at
her
heart
that
she
was
too
proud
to
own
sat
there
and
waited
she
looked
back
afterwards
upon
that
moment
as
the
last
shivering
pause
before
she
made
that
amazing
plunge
that
was
to
give
her
new
life
the
sound
of
a
little
forlorn
bell
suddenly
penetrated
the
rain
it
was
just
such
a
bell
as
rang
every
sunday
from
chapels
across
the
glebeshire
moors
and
maggie
knew
when
aunt
elizabeth
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
upon
her
that
the
summons
was
for
her
oh
my
dear
a
favourite
exclamation
of
aunt
elizabeth
and
not
ready
the
bell
begun
the
rain
coming
down
very
hard
afraid
it
only
a
step
from
our
door
your
things
dear
as
quick
as
you
can
the
girl
ran
upstairs
and
stayed
by
some
sudden
impulse
stood
for
a
moment
before
the
long
mirror
it
was
as
though
she
were
imploring
that
familiar
casual
figure
that
she
saw
there
not
to
leave
her
the
only
friend
she
had
in
a
world
that
was
suddenly
terrifying
and
alarming
her
old
black
dress
that
had
seemed
almost
smart
for
the
dreot
funeral
now
appeared
most
desperately
shabby
she
knew
that
her
black
hat
was
anything
but
attractive
what
do
i
care
for
them
all
her
heart
said
defiantly
what
do
they
matter
to
me
she
marched
out
of
the
house
behind
the
aunts
with
her
head
in
the
air
very
conscious
of
a
hole
in
one
of
her
thin
black
gloves
the
street
deserted
danced
in
the
rain
the
little
bell
clanged
with
the
stupid
monotony
of
its
one
obstinate
idea
the
town
wore
its
customary
sunday
air
of
a
stage
when
the
performance
is
concluded
the
audience
vanished
and
the
lights
turned
down
the
aunts
had
a
solemn
air
as
though
they
were
carrying
maggie
as
a
sacrifice
all
these
things
were
depressing
they
turned
out
of
their
own
street
into
a
thin
grey
one
in
which
the
puddles
sprang
and
danced
against
isolated
and
a
desolate
the
little
bell
was
now
loud
and
strident
and
when
they
passed
into
a
passage
which
led
into
a
square
rather
grimy
yard
maggie
saw
that
they
had
arrived
before
her
was
a
hideous
building
the
colour
of
beef
badly
cooked
with
grey
stone
streaks
in
it
here
and
there
and
thin
narrow
windows
of
grey
glass
with
stiff
iron
divisions
between
the
glass
the
porch
to
the
door
was
of
the
ugliest
grey
stone
with
the
lord
cometh
in
big
black
letters
across
the
top
of
it
just
inside
the
door
was
a
muddy
red
mat
and
near
the
mat
stood
a
gentleman
in
a
faded
and
brown
boots
an
official
apparently
there
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
maggie
and
her
aunts
a
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
all
hidden
beneath
umbrellas
as
they
stood
in
the
doorway
a
sudden
scurry
of
wind
and
rain
drove
them
all
forward
so
that
there
was
some
crush
and
confusion
in
the
little
passage
beyond
the
door
waterproofs
steamed
umbrellas
were
ranged
in
dripping
disorder
against
the
wall
the
official
who
talked
in
a
hushed
whisper
that
was
drowned
by
the
creaking
of
his
boots
welcomed
them
all
with
the
intimacy
of
an
old
acquaintance
oh
miss
hearst
terrible
weather
no
she
not
here
yet
good
morning
smith
very
glad
you
better
yes
i
spoke
to
them
about
the
they
promised
to
return
them
this
morning
and
so
on
he
turned
pushed
back
a
door
and
led
the
way
into
the
chapel
the
interior
was
as
ugly
as
the
outside
the
walls
were
of
the
coldest
grey
stone
broken
here
and
there
by
the
lighter
grey
of
a
window
across
the
roof
were
rafters
built
of
that
bright
shining
wood
that
belongs
intimately
to
colonial
life
apples
of
an
immense
size
and
brushwood
two
lamps
of
black
iron
hung
from
these
rafters
at
the
farther
end
of
the
chapel
was
a
rail
of
this
same
bright
wood
and
behind
the
rail
a
desk
and
a
chair
in
front
of
the
rail
was
a
harmonium
before
which
was
already
seated
a
stout
and
expectant
lady
evidently
eager
to
begin
her
duties
of
the
day
the
chapel
was
not
very
large
and
was
already
nearly
filled
the
congregation
was
sitting
in
absolute
silence
so
that
the
passing
of
maggie
and
her
aunts
up
the
aisle
attracted
great
attention
all
eyes
were
turned
in
their
direction
and
maggie
felt
that
she
herself
was
an
object
of
very
especial
interest
aunt
anne
walked
first
and
took
what
was
obviously
her
own
regular
seat
near
the
front
maggie
sat
between
her
two
aunts
she
could
not
feel
for
the
moment
anything
but
a
startled
surprise
at
the
ugliness
of
the
building
she
had
entered
at
different
times
the
glebeshire
chapels
but
their
primitive
position
and
need
had
given
them
the
spirit
of
honest
sincerity
here
she
had
expected
she
did
not
know
what
always
from
those
very
early
days
when
she
had
first
heard
about
her
aunts
she
had
had
visions
of
a
strange
illuminated
place
into
which
god
riding
on
a
chariot
clothed
in
flames
would
one
day
come
even
after
she
had
grown
up
she
had
still
fancied
that
the
centre
of
her
aunts
strange
fantastic
religion
must
be
a
strange
fantastic
place
and
yet
now
as
she
looked
around
her
she
was
not
to
her
own
surprise
disappointed
she
was
even
satisfied
the
wonder
was
not
in
the
building
well
then
it
must
be
in
something
inside
something
that
she
had
yet
to
discover
the
chapel
had
the
thrilling
quality
of
a
little
plain
deal
box
that
carries
a
jewel
she
examined
then
the
people
around
her
women
were
in
a
great
majority
a
man
scattered
forlornly
amongst
them
once
and
again
she
discovered
at
once
the
alert
eyes
of
young
warlock
he
was
seated
in
the
side
aisle
with
a
thin
woman
beside
him
he
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
wriggling
sometimes
his
broad
back
as
though
he
were
a
dog
tied
by
a
chain
some
one
else
very
quickly
claimed
maggie
attention
this
was
a
girl
who
in
the
seat
behind
warlock
was
as
noticeable
in
that
congregation
as
a
amongst
a
colony
of
crows
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
light
blue
silk
and
a
large
hat
of
blue
with
a
grey
bird
in
the
front
of
it
her
hair
beneath
the
hat
was
bright
gold
her
cheeks
were
the
brightest
pink
and
her
eyes
sparkled
in
a
most
lovely
and
fascinating
manner
she
was
immensely
interesting
to
maggie
who
had
never
in
her
life
dreamed
of
anything
so
dazzling
she
was
very
restless
and
animated
and
there
sat
at
her
side
a
stout
and
solemn
woman
who
was
evidently
from
a
strange
almost
ironical
likeness
her
mother
the
young
lady
seemed
to
regard
both
the
place
and
the
occasion
as
the
greatest
joke
in
the
world
she
flung
her
eyes
from
one
to
another
as
though
inviting
some
one
to
share
her
merriment
amongst
that
assembly
the
blue
dress
shone
out
as
though
it
would
attract
everything
to
itself
she
very
pretty
thought
maggie
who
was
more
conscious
of
her
shabby
clothes
than
ever
but
her
chief
feeling
was
of
surprise
that
so
brilliant
a
bird
had
been
able
to
penetrate
into
the
chapel
at
all
she
must
be
a
stranger
just
come
out
of
curiosity
then
the
girl
eyes
suddenly
met
maggie
and
held
them
the
brilliant
creature
smiled
and
maggie
smiled
in
return
she
looked
afterwards
at
aunt
anne
but
aunt
anne
buried
in
her
book
of
devotions
had
seen
nothing
suddenly
after
a
strange
wheeze
and
muffled
scream
the
harmonium
began
every
one
looked
up
expectantly
warlock
alone
appeared
from
a
door
at
the
right
of
the
screen
and
took
his
place
behind
the
desk
he
stood
for
a
moment
facing
them
before
he
took
his
place
he
was
a
man
of
great
size
old
now
but
holding
himself
absolutely
erect
he
was
dressed
in
a
plain
black
gown
with
a
low
white
collar
and
a
white
tie
this
long
gown
added
to
his
height
but
the
width
of
the
shoulders
and
neck
and
the
carriage
of
his
head
showed
that
he
was
a
man
built
on
a
noble
scale
his
hair
was
and
he
wore
a
beard
that
was
in
startling
contrast
against
his
black
gown
his
cheeks
were
of
high
colour
his
eyes
blue
he
was
older
than
maggie
had
expected
and
must
she
thought
be
over
seventy
his
whole
bearing
and
behaviour
was
of
a
man
who
had
enjoyed
great
physical
health
his
expression
was
mild
and
simple
dignified
but
not
proud
utterly
unconscious
of
self
earnest
and
determined
lacking
in
humour
perhaps
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
theatrical
about
him
and
yet
he
conveyed
an
impression
that
was
startling
and
dramatic
his
was
a
figure
that
would
have
been
noticed
anywhere
if
only
for
its
physical
health
and
shining
cleanliness
maggie
felt
that
to
many
people
there
his
entrance
was
a
sensation
sought
for
and
expected
by
them
so
startling
was
the
impression
that
he
made
upon
herself
that
she
wondered
that
the
chapel
was
not
crowded
by
an
excited
throng
she
liked
him
at
once
felt
that
she
would
be
at
ease
with
him
as
she
had
never
been
with
anybody
in
her
life
and
yet
behind
this
there
was
perhaps
some
subtle
sense
of
disappointment
he
was
not
mysterious
he
did
not
seem
very
clever
he
was
only
an
old
man
magnificently
preserved
there
was
no
fear
nor
wonder
in
her
attitude
to
him
he
could
not
convince
her
she
thought
of
things
that
she
herself
had
not
seen
he
knelt
and
prayed
for
a
moment
before
his
desk
then
he
rose
and
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
wood
before
him
said
let
us
offer
thanks
to
almighty
god
that
he
has
kept
us
in
safety
and
in
health
during
the
past
week
they
all
knelt
down
he
prayed
then
in
a
voice
that
was
soft
and
clear
and
that
hid
behind
the
words
a
little
roughness
of
accent
that
was
not
unpleasant
his
prayer
was
extempore
and
he
addressed
god
intimately
and
almost
conversationally
thou
knowest
how
we
are
weak
and
foolish
our
faults
are
all
known
to
thee
and
our
blunders
are
not
hid
therefore
we
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
not
been
impatient
with
us
but
seeing
that
we
are
but
little
children
in
thy
hands
hast
deemed
the
thunderbolt
too
heavy
for
our
heads
and
the
lightning
too
blinding
for
our
eyes
with
humble
hearts
we
thank
thee
and
pray
that
thou
wilt
keep
us
mindful
of
thy
coming
that
we
may
be
found
watching
with
our
loins
girt
and
our
lamps
lit
waiting
in
prayer
for
thy
dreadful
day
during
this
prayer
maggie
was
conscious
of
a
strange
excitement
she
knelt
with
her
eyes
tightly
closed
but
through
the
darkness
she
felt
as
though
he
were
addressing
her
alone
she
seemed
to
approach
him
to
feel
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
to
hear
his
voice
in
her
ears
when
she
rose
at
the
ending
of
the
prayer
it
was
as
though
she
had
definitely
passed
through
some
door
into
a
new
room
then
rising
she
was
conscious
that
the
laughing
eyes
of
the
young
lady
in
blue
were
again
trying
to
hold
her
own
she
refused
to
look
she
coloured
hanging
her
head
so
that
her
eyes
should
not
be
caught
for
some
time
she
was
unaware
of
the
progress
of
the
service
then
the
clear
emphasis
of
his
voice
caught
again
her
attention
our
lesson
for
he
said
is
from
the
fortieth
chapter
of
isaiah
he
proceeded
to
read
comfort
ye
comfort
ye
my
people
saith
your
god
speak
ye
comfortably
to
jerusalem
and
cry
unto
her
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
the
voice
of
him
that
crieth
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
plain
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken

the
voice
said
cry
and
he
said
what
shall
i
cry
all
flesh
is
grass
and
all
the
goodliness
thereof
is
as
the
flower
of
the
field
the
grass
withereth
the
flower
fadeth
but
the
word
of
our
god
shall
stand
for
ever
o
zion
that
bringest
good
tidings
get
thee
up
into
the
high
mountain
o
jerusalem
that
bringest
good
tidings
lift
up
thy
voice
with
strength
lift
it
up
be
not
afraid
say
unto
the
cities
of
judah
behold
your
god
behold
the
lord
god
will
come
with
strong
hand
and
his
arm
shall
rule
for
him
behold
his
reward
is
with
him
and
his
work
before
him
he
shall
feed
his
flock
like
a
shepherd
he
shall
gather
the
lambs
with
his
arm
and
carry
them
in
his
bosom
and
shall
gently
lead
those
that
are
with
young
how
many
times
had
maggie
heard
the
reading
of
those
words
they
brought
instantly
back
to
her
her
father
voice
the
strange
snuffling
hurry
with
which
he
hastened
to
the
end
his
voice
hesitating
a
little
as
his
wandering
eye
caught
the
misbehaviour
of
some
small
boy
in
the
choir
now
the
words
were
charged
with
a
conviction
that
was
neither
forced
nor
adopted
for
dramatic
effect
it
was
as
though
a
herald
read
some
proclamation
for
his
master
who
was
approaching
the
gates
of
the
city
the
hymns
and
prayers
that
followed
seemed
to
have
no
importance
the
hymns
happened
on
that
day
to
be
familiar
ones
that
maggie
had
always
known
as
pants
the
hart
for
cooling
streams
just
as
i
am
without
one
plea
and
jerusalem
the
golden
these
were
sung
of
course
slowly
badly
and
sentimentally
the
harmonium
screaming
in
amazing
discords
and
the
deep
and
untuneful
voices
of
some
members
of
the
congregation
drowning
the
ladies
and
placing
a
general
discord
upon
everything
especially
distressing
was
aunt
elizabeth
who
evidently
loved
to
sing
hymns
but
had
little
idea
of
melody
or
rhythm
and
was
influenced
entirely
by
a
copious
sentiment
which
overflowed
into
her
eyes
and
trembled
at
the
tips
of
her
fingers
all
this
was
as
naive
and
awkward
as
is
always
the
singing
of
english
hymns
in
english
churches
by
english
citizens
the
chapel
which
had
seemed
before
to
be
rising
to
some
strange
atmosphere
of
expectation
slipped
back
now
to
its
native
ugliness
and
sterility
the
personality
was
in
the
man
and
in
the
man
alone
maggie
looked
about
her
at
the
faces
of
the
women
who
surrounded
her
they
were
grey
strained
ugly
in
the
poor
light
of
the
building
the
majority
of
them
seemed
to
be
either
or
women
who
had
passed
the
adventurous
period
of
life
and
had
passed
it
without
adventure
when
the
time
for
the
sermon
arrived
warlock
prayed
his
head
bowed
during
a
moment
silence
then
leaning
forward
on
his
desk
repeated
some
of
the
words
of
his
earlier
reading
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
plain
say
unto
the
cities
of
judah
behold
your
god
what
followed
was
practical
eloquent
the
preaching
of
a
man
who
had
through
the
course
of
a
long
life
addressed
men
of
all
kinds
and
in
all
places
but
behind
the
facility
and
easy
flow
of
his
words
maggie
fancied
that
she
detected
some
urgent
insistence
that
came
from
the
man
very
heart
she
was
moved
by
that
as
though
he
were
saying
to
her
personally
do
heed
these
outward
words
of
mine
but
listen
to
me
myself
there
is
something
i
must
tell
you
there
is
no
time
to
lose
you
must
believe
me
i
will
compel
your
belief
follow
me
and
i
will
show
what
will
transform
your
life
he
concluded
his
sermon
with
these
words
and
what
of
our
responsibility
we
may
compare
ourselves
i
think
to
men
who
banded
together
on
some
secret
service
wait
for
the
moment
when
they
are
to
declare
themselves
and
by
that
action
transform
the
world
until
that
moment
comes
they
must
lead
their
ordinary
daily
lives
seem
as
careless
of
the
future
as
their
fellows
laugh
and
eat
and
work
and
play
as
though
nothing
beyond
the
business
of
the
day
were
their
concern
but
in
their
hearts
is
the
responsibility
of
their
secret
knowledge
they
can
not
be
as
other
men
knowing
what
they
do
they
can
not
be
to
one
another
as
they
are
to
other
men
with
the
bond
of
their
common
duty
shared
between
them
much
has
been
given
them
much
will
be
demanded
of
them
and
when
the
day
comes
it
will
not
be
the
events
of
that
day
that
will
test
them
but
the
private
history
known
only
to
themselves
and
their
master
of
the
hours
that
have
preceded
that
day
i
tell
you
what
i
have
often
told
you
before
from
this
same
place
that
beside
the
history
of
the
spirit
the
history
of
the
body
is
nothing
and
that
history
of
the
spirit
is
no
easy
tranquil
progress
from
birth
to
death
but
must
rather
be
if
we
are
to
have
any
history
at
all
a
struggle
a
wrestling
a
contest
bloody
unceasing
uncertain
in
its
issue
from
the
first
hour
until
the
last
this
is
no
mere
warning
spoken
from
the
lips
only
by
one
who
from
sheer
weekly
necessity
may
seem
to
you
formal
and
official
it
is
as
urgent
as
deeply
from
the
heart
as
though
it
were
a
summons
from
a
messenger
who
has
come
to
you
directly
from
his
master
i
beg
of
you
to
consider
your
responsibility
which
is
greater
than
that
of
other
men
we
are
brothers
bound
together
by
a
great
expectation
a
great
preparation
a
great
trust
we
are
in
training
for
a
day
when
more
will
be
demanded
of
us
than
of
any
other
men
upon
the
earth
that
is
no
light
thing
let
us
hold
ourselves
then
as
souls
upon
whom
a
great
charge
is
laid
when
he
had
ended
and
knelt
again
to
pray
maggie
felt
instantly
the
inevitable
reaction
the
harmonium
quavered
and
rumbled
over
the
first
bars
of
some
hymn
which
began
with
the
words
cry
sinner
cry
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
the
man
with
the
brown
creaking
boots
walked
about
with
a
collection
plate
an
odour
of
badly
heated
penetrated
the
building
the
rain
lashed
the
grey
maggie
looking
about
her
could
not
see
in
the
pale
tired
faces
of
the
women
who
surrounded
her
the
ardent
souls
of
a
glorious
band
their
belief
in
the
coming
of
god
had
it
seemed
done
very
little
for
them
it
might
be
true
that
the
history
of
the
soul
was
of
more
importance
than
the
history
of
the
body
but
common
sense
had
something
to
say
her
mind
went
back
inevitably
to
dreot
church
her
father
ellen
the
cook
that
was
what
the
history
of
the
spirit
had
been
to
her
so
far
what
reason
had
she
to
suppose
that
this
was
any
more
real
than
that
had
been
nevertheless
when
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
she
left
the
building
and
went
once
more
into
the
soaking
streets
some
sense
of
expectation
was
with
her
so
that
she
hastened
into
her
aunt
house
as
though
she
would
find
that
some
strange
event
had
occurred
in
her
absence
nothing
of
course
had
occurred
during
the
afternoon
the
rain
ceased
to
fall
and
a
dim
grey
light
born
of
an
intense
silence
enveloped
the
town
about
three
the
aunts
went
out
to
some
religious
gathering
and
maggie
was
left
to
herself
she
discovered
in
aunt
elizabeth
bedroom
a
bound
volume
of
good
words
and
with
this
seated
herself
by
the
fire
soon
she
slept
she
was
awakened
by
a
consciousness
that
some
one
was
in
the
room
and
sitting
up
staring
through
the
gloom
heard
a
movement
near
the
door
a
rustle
a
little
jingle
a
laugh
is
any
one
there
said
a
high
shrill
voice
maggie
got
up
i
here
she
said
some
one
came
forward
it
was
the
girl
of
the
blue
dress
who
had
smiled
at
maggie
in
chapel
she
held
out
her
hand
i
hope
you
do
think
me
too
awful
my
name
caroline
smith
how
do
you
do
they
shook
hands
maggie
still
bewildered
by
sleep
said
stammering
wo
you
sit
down
i
beg
your
pardon
my
aunts
oh
it
is
the
aunts
i
wanted
to
see
replied
miss
smith
laughing
so
that
a
number
of
little
bracelets
jingled
most
tunefully
together
i
came
to
see
you
we
smiled
at
one
another
in
chapel
it
was
your
first
time
was
it
did
you
think
it
all
awfully
quaint
wo
you
sit
down
said
maggie
again
and
i
ring
for
the
lamp
oh
do
ring
for
the
lamp
i
like
the
dusk
and
we
can
make
friends
so
much
better
without
a
lamp
i
always
say
if
you
want
to
know
anybody
really
well
do
have
a
light
she
seated
herself
near
the
fire
arranging
her
dress
very
carefully
patting
her
hair
beneath
her
hat
poking
her
shoes
out
from
beneath
her
skirts
then
withdrawing
them
again
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
maggie
stared
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
had
never
met
any
one
in
the
least
like
this
before
i
do
hope
miss
smith
went
on
that
you
do
think
me
forward
i
daresay
you
do
but
i
ca
bear
wasting
time
of
course
i
heard
that
you
were
coming
so
then
i
looked
out
for
you
in
chapel
i
thought
you
looked
so
nice
that
i
said
to
mother
go
and
see
her
this
very
afternoon
of
course
i
known
your
aunts
for
ages
always
in
and
out
here
so
that
it
is
as
bad
as
it
seems
they
all
be
back
for
tea
soon
and
i
want
to
have
a
talk
first
thank
you
very
much
was
all
that
maggie
could
think
of
to
say
you
come
to
live
here
have
you
continued
miss
smith
i
so
glad
i
think
you
look
so
nice
you
do
mind
my
saying
that
do
you
i
always
tell
people
what
i
think
of
them
and
then
one
knows
where
one
is
now
do
tell
me
i
simply
dying
to
know
what
do
you
think
of
everything
well
said
maggie
smiling
i
only
arrived
here
yesterday
rather
difficult
to
say
oh
i
know
i
saw
magnus
this
morning
and
he
told
me
that
he
met
you
he
said
you
were
you
do
look
it
was
very
silly
of
me
said
maggie
i
do
know
what
made
me
faint
i
never
done
such
a
thing
before
i
used
to
faint
simply
heaps
of
times
when
i
was
a
kid
said
miss
smith
i
was
always
doing
it
i
had
all
sorts
of
doctors
they
thought
i
never
grow
up
i
not
very
strong
now
really
they
say
it
heart
but
i
always
say
it
ca
be
that
because
i
given
it
all
away
here
miss
smith
laughed
immoderately
were
they
the
most
terrible
set
of
frumps
at
chapel
this
morning
she
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
went
on
warlock
all
right
of
course
i
think
he
such
a
man
do
you
of
course
he
old
now
but
his
beard
rather
attractive
i
think
he
a
duck
but
is
that
harmonium
ghastly
i
ca
think
why
they
do
buy
an
organ
they
most
awfully
rich
i
know
and
do
simply
nothing
with
their
money
why
do
you
go
said
maggie
if
you
think
it
all
so
dreadful
oh
i
have
to
go
said
miss
smith
to
please
mother
and
one
has
to
do
something
on
sunday
and
besides
one
sees
one
friends
did
you
notice
martin
warlock
warlock
son
you
know
he
was
sitting
quite
close
to
me
he
was
here
yesterday
afternoon
said
maggie
quietly
oh
was
he
really
now
that
is
interesting
i
wonder
what
he
came
for
he
scarcely
ever
comes
here
did
you
like
him
i
did
speak
to
him
said
maggie
of
course
he
only
been
here
a
little
time
he
warlock
only
son
he
lived
for
years
abroad
and
then
the
other
day
his
aunt
died
and
left
him
some
money
so
he
came
home
his
father
simply
adores
him
they
say
but
of
course
i
do
know
do
quote
me
that
he
been
most
awfully
wild
drink
all
sorts
of
things
but
of
course
say
anything
of
anybody
i
think
he
got
such
an
interesting
face
do
you
i
do
think
said
maggie
that
you
ought
to
say
those
things
of
any
one
if
you
do
know
they
true
oh
what
a
darling
you
are
said
miss
smith
you
perfectly
right
one
ought
but
every
one
does
when
you
lived
up
here
a
little
while
you
will
too
and
what
does
it
matter
you
sure
to
hear
it
sooner
or
later
but
that
right
you
keep
me
straight
i
know
i
talk
far
too
much
i
always
being
told
about
it
but
what
can
one
do
life
so
funny
one
must
talk
about
it
you
have
seen
miss
avies
and
thurston
yet
have
you
no
said
maggie
not
unless
i
saw
them
in
chapel
this
morning
ah
they
the
ones
said
miss
smith
no
they
were
there
they
away
on
a
mission
they
make
things
hum
they
quarrel
with
warlock
because
they
say
he
is
noisy
enough
awful
and
miss
avies
is
much
better
you
have
them
on
to
you
soon
enough
but
of
course
i
not
one
of
the
inside
ones
inside
ones
asked
maggie
yes
the
real
ones
they
be
at
you
after
a
time
and
ask
you
if
you
join
them
the
congregation
this
morning
was
just
anybody
who
likes
to
come
but
the
real
brethren
have
to
swear
vows
and
be
baptized
and
all
sorts
of
things
but
that
only
if
you
believe
god
really
coming
in
a
year
or
two
of
course
i
do
although
sometimes
it
makes
one
quite
creepy
all
down
one
spine
in
case
after
all
he
really
should
come
you
know
are
my
aunts
inside
asked
maggie
of
course
they
are
miss
anne
cardinal
one
of
the
chief
of
them
miss
avies
is
jealous
as
anything
of
her
but
your
aunt
so
quiet
that
miss
avies
ca
do
anything
i
just
love
your
aunts
i
think
sweet
you
will
be
a
friend
of
mine
wo
you
i
like
you
so
much
i
like
your
being
quiet
and
telling
me
when
i
talk
too
much
i
sound
silly
i
know
but
it
really
mother
fault
as
i
always
tell
her
she
never
brought
me
up
at
all
she
likes
me
to
wear
pretty
things
and
does
care
about
anything
else
poor
mother
she
had
such
a
time
with
father
he
one
of
the
most
serious
of
all
the
brethren
and
never
has
time
to
think
about
any
of
us
then
he
in
a
bank
all
the
week
where
he
ca
think
about
god
much
because
he
makes
mistakes
about
figures
if
he
does
so
he
has
to
put
it
all
into
sunday
we
will
be
friends
wo
we
it
came
to
maggie
with
a
strange
ironic
little
pang
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
any
one
had
asked
for
her
friendship
of
course
she
said
miss
smith
further
confidences
were
interrupted
by
the
aunts
and
behind
them
to
maggie
great
surprise
warlock
and
his
son
the
sudden
descent
of
these
gentlemen
upon
the
still
lingering
echoes
of
miss
caroline
smith
critical
and
explanatory
remarks
embarrassed
maggie
not
so
miss
smith
she
kissed
both
the
aunts
with
an
emphasis
that
they
apparently
appreciated
for
they
smiled
and
aunt
anne
laid
her
hand
affectionately
upon
the
girl
sleeve
maggie
watching
felt
the
strangest
little
pang
of
jealousy
that
was
the
way
that
she
should
have
behaved
been
warm
and
demonstrative
from
the
beginning
but
she
could
not
even
now
she
stood
back
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
watching
them
all
with
large
grave
eyes
hoping
that
they
would
not
notice
her
with
warlock
and
his
son
also
miss
smith
seemed
perfectly
at
home
chattering
laughing
up
into
young
warlock
eyes
as
though
there
were
some
especial
understanding
between
them
maggie
nevertheless
fancied
that
he
young
warlock
was
not
listening
to
her
his
eyes
wandered
he
had
that
same
restlessness
of
body
that
she
had
before
noticed
in
him
swinging
a
little
on
his
legs
set
apart
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
thick
broad
back
he
had
some
compelling
interest
for
her
he
had
had
that
she
now
realised
since
the
first
moment
that
she
had
seen
him
it
might
be
that
the
things
that
that
girl
had
told
her
about
him
increased
her
interest
and
perhaps
her
sympathy
but
it
was
his
strange
detached
air
of
observation
that
held
her
as
though
he
were
a
being
from
some
other
planet
watching
them
all
liking
them
but
bearing
no
kind
of
relation
to
them
except
that
of
a
cheerful
observer
it
was
this
that
attracted
her
she
liked
his
thick
rough
untidy
hair
the
healthy
red
brown
of
his
cheeks
his
light
blue
eyes
his
air
of
vigour
and
bodily
health
as
she
waited
she
was
startled
into
consciousness
by
a
voice
in
her
ear
she
turned
to
find
the
elder
warlock
beside
her
you
will
forgive
my
speaking
to
you
miss
cardinal
i
saw
you
at
our
chapel
this
morning
his
great
height
towered
above
her
short
clumsy
figure
he
seemed
to
peer
down
at
her
from
above
his
snowy
beard
as
though
he
were
the
inhabitant
of
some
other
world
his
voice
was
of
an
extreme
kindliness
and
his
eyes
when
she
looked
up
at
him
shone
with
friendliness
she
found
herself
to
her
own
surprise
talking
to
him
with
great
ease
he
was
perfectly
simple
human
and
unaffected
he
asked
her
about
her
country
i
spend
my
days
in
longing
to
get
back
to
my
own
place
and
perhaps
i
shall
never
see
it
again
i
was
born
in
wiltshire
salisbury
plain
my
my
grandfather
my
father
they
all
were
ministers
of
our
chapel
there
before
me
they
had
no
thought
in
their
day
of
london
i
have
always
missed
that
space
the
quiet
i
shall
always
miss
it
towns
are
not
friendly
to
me
she
told
him
about
dreots
a
little
about
her
father
ah
you
lucky
he
said
you
return
many
times
before
you
die
and
you
find
no
change
there
those
places
do
not
change
as
towns
do
they
were
standing
apart
from
the
others
near
the
window
he
suddenly
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
smiling
at
her
my
dear
he
said
you
do
mind
me
saying
dear
but
an
old
man
has
his
privileges
will
you
come
and
see
us
whenever
you
care
to
my
wife
will
be
so
glad
i
know
that
at
first
one
can
be
lonely
in
this
great
place
just
come
in
when
you
please
he
took
her
hand
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
back
to
aunt
anne
who
was
now
pouring
out
tea
at
a
little
table
by
the
fire
martin
warlock
as
his
father
moved
away
came
across
to
her
she
had
known
that
he
would
do
that
as
though
something
had
been
arranged
between
them
when
he
came
to
her
however
he
stood
there
before
her
and
had
nothing
to
say
she
also
had
nothing
to
say
his
eyes
searched
her
face
then
he
broke
out
abruptly
are
you
better
i
all
right
she
answered
him
brusquely
please
do
say
anything
about
yesterday
it
was
an
idiotic
thing
to
do
that
what
i
came
about
to
see
how
you
were
he
answered
her
his
eyes
laughing
at
her
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
coming
otherwise
you
know
i
saw
you
in
chapel
this
morning
so
i
guessed
you
were
all
right
but
it
seemed
such
bad
luck
fainting
right
off
the
minute
you
got
here
i
never
fainted
in
my
life
before
she
answered
no
you
do
look
the
sort
of
girl
who
faint
but
i
suppose
had
a
rotten
time
with
your
father
and
all
his
eyes
still
searched
for
hers
she
determined
that
she
would
not
look
at
him
her
heart
was
beating
strangely
and
although
she
did
not
look
she
could
in
some
way
see
the
rough
toss
of
his
hair
against
his
forehead
she
could
smell
the
stuff
of
his
coat
but
she
would
not
look
up
you
going
to
live
here
are
you
yes
she
said
i
only
just
come
back
he
went
on
i
know
she
said
oh
of
course
that
girl
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
and
laughing
she
told
you
she
been
here
this
afternoon
has
she
she
chatters
like
anything
do
you
believe
half
she
says
there
was
another
pause
the
voices
at
the
seemed
to
come
from
very
far
away
then
he
said
roughly
moving
a
very
little
nearer
to
her
i
glad
you
come
at
that
she
raised
her
eyes
her
cheeks
flushed
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
her
head
up
her
heart
thundered
in
her
breast
she
felt
as
though
she
were
at
the
beginning
of
some
tremendous
adventure
an
adventure
enthralling
magnificent
and
perilous
part
ii
the
chariot
of
fire
chapter
i
the
warlocks
there
is
beyond
question
in
human
nature
such
a
thing
as
an
inherited
consciousness
of
god
and
this
consciousness
if
inherited
through
many
generations
may
defy
apparent
reason
all
progress
of
vaunted
civilisations
and
even
it
may
be
suggested
the
actual
challenge
of
death
itself
this
consciousness
of
god
had
been
quite
simply
the
foundation
of
warlock
history
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
expressed
itself
in
the
formula
of
john
wesley
revival
the
john
wesley
of
that
day
preached
up
and
down
the
length
and
breadth
of
westmoreland
cumberland
northumberland
durham
and
being
a
fighter
a
preacher
and
a
human
being
at
one
and
the
same
time
received
a
large
following
and
died
full
of
years
and
honours
it
was
somewhere
about
that
this
john
grandson
james
warlock
martin
grandfather
broke
from
the
main
body
and
led
his
little
flock
on
to
the
wide
spaces
of
salisbury
plain
james
warlock
unlike
his
father
and
grandfather
was
a
little
sickly
man
with
a
narrow
chest
no
limbs
to
speak
of
and
a
sharp
pale
face
martin
had
a
faded
daguerreotype
of
him
set
against
the
background
of
the
old
wiltshire
kitchen
his
black
clothes
hung
upon
him
like
a
disguise
his
eyes
burning
even
upon
that
faded
picture
with
the
fire
of
his
spirit
for
james
warlock
was
a
mystic
a
visionary
a
prophet
he
walked
and
talked
with
god
in
no
jesting
spirit
it
was
said
that
he
knew
plans
and
could
turn
the
world
into
a
blazing
coal
so
soon
as
he
pleased
it
was
because
he
knew
with
certainty
that
god
would
in
person
soon
descend
upon
the
earth
that
he
separated
from
the
main
body
and
led
his
little
band
down
into
wiltshire
here
on
the
broad
gleaming
plain
they
prepared
for
god
coming
named
now
the
kingscote
brethren
after
their
new
abode
they
built
a
chapel
sat
down
and
waited
then
in
the
prophet
declared
that
the
coming
was
not
yet
that
it
would
be
in
the
next
generation
but
that
their
preparations
must
not
be
relaxed
he
himself
prepared
by
taking
to
himself
a
wife
a
calm
untroubled
countrywoman
of
the
place
that
she
might
give
him
a
son
whom
he
might
prepare
in
due
course
for
his
great
destiny
john
father
of
martin
was
born
a
smiling
infant
with
the
tranquillity
of
his
mother
as
well
as
something
of
the
mysticism
of
his
father
upon
him
as
upon
his
ancestors
this
consciousness
of
god
had
most
absolutely
descended
never
for
a
moment
did
he
question
the
facts
that
his
father
told
to
him
he
grew
into
a
giant
of
health
and
strength
and
those
who
in
those
old
days
saw
them
tell
that
it
was
a
strange
picture
to
watch
the
little
wizened
man
walking
with
odd
emotional
gestures
with
little
hops
and
leaps
and
swinging
of
the
arms
beside
the
firm
long
stride
of
the
young
man
towering
above
him
when
young
john
was
years
of
age
his
father
was
found
dead
under
a
tree
upon
a
summer
evening
his
expression
was
of
a
man
challenging
some
new
and
startling
discovery
he
had
found
perhaps
new
visions
to
confront
his
gaze
they
buried
him
in
kingscote
and
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
but
they
were
approaching
new
and
modern
times
these
old
days
of
simple
faith
and
superstition
were
passing
never
to
return
there
were
new
elements
in
the
kingscote
company
of
souls
and
these
elements
demanded
freer
play
both
of
thought
and
action
they
argued
that
as
to
them
alone
out
of
all
the
world
the
time
and
manner
of
god
coming
was
known
they
should
influence
with
their
activities
some
wider
sphere
than
this
wiltshire
village
john
warlock
clung
with
all
his
strength
to
the
old
world
that
he
knew
the
world
that
gave
him
leisure
and
quiet
for
contemplation
he
had
no
wish
to
bring
in
converts
to
stir
england
into
a
frenzy
of
terror
and
anticipation
god
gave
him
no
command
to
spread
his
beliefs
even
his
father
fanatic
though
he
had
been
had
cherished
his
own
small
company
of
saints
as
souls
to
whom
these
things
hidden
deliberately
from
the
outside
world
had
especially
been
entrusted
so
long
as
he
could
he
resisted
then
when
he
was
about
forty
somewhere
around
the
kingscote
brethren
moved
to
london
in
this
year
john
warlock
was
and
the
kingscote
brethren
had
had
their
chapel
in
solomon
place
behind
garrick
street
for
years
in
john
warlock
had
married
amelia
daughter
of
francis
stephens
merchant
in
a
daughter
amy
was
born
to
them
in
martin
they
had
no
other
children
martin
was
at
the
time
of
maggie
arrival
in
london
years
of
age
upon
a
certain
fine
evening
a
fortnight
after
martin
warlock
first
meeting
with
maggie
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
his
house
in
garrick
street
and
having
forgotten
his
was
compelled
to
ring
the
old
screaming
bell
that
had
long
survived
its
respectable
reputable
days
the
warlocks
had
lived
during
the
last
ten
years
in
an
upper
part
above
a
curiosity
shop
four
doors
from
the
garrick
club
in
garrick
street
there
was
a
that
abutted
on
to
the
and
passing
through
it
you
stumbled
along
a
little
dark
passage
like
a
rabbit
warren
up
some
crooked
stairs
and
found
yourself
in
the
warlock
country
without
ever
troubling
spencer
the
stout
hearty
but
inartistic
owner
of
the
curiosity
shop
on
the
present
occasion
after
pulling
the
bell
martin
stared
down
the
street
as
though
somewhere
in
the
dim
golden
light
of
its
farthest
recesses
he
would
find
an
answer
to
a
question
that
he
was
asking
the
broad
sturdy
strength
of
his
body
the
easy
of
his
expression
spoke
of
a
life
lived
physically
rather
than
mentally
and
yet
this
was
only
half
true
martin
warlock
should
at
this
time
have
been
a
quite
normal
young
man
with
normal
desires
normal
passions
normal
instincts
such
he
would
undoubtedly
have
been
had
he
not
had
his
early
environment
of
egotism
mystery
and
had
he
also
not
developed
through
his
childhood
and
youth
his
passionate
devotion
to
his
father
the
religious
ceremonies
of
his
young
days
had
made
him
and
introspective
and
although
during
his
years
abroad
he
had
felt
on
many
occasions
that
he
was
completely
freed
from
his
early
bondage
scenes
thoughts
and
longings
would
recur
and
remind
him
that
he
was
celebrating
his
liberty
too
soon
the
licences
that
to
most
men
in
their
first
youth
are
incidental
and
easily
forgotten
engraved
themselves
upon
martin
reluctant
soul
because
of
that
religious
sense
that
had
been
driven
in
upon
him
at
the
very
hour
of
his
birth
he
could
not
sin
and
forget
he
sinned
and
was
remorseful
was
impatient
at
his
remorse
sinned
again
to
rid
himself
of
it
and
was
more
remorseful
still
the
main
impulse
of
his
life
at
this
time
was
his
he
fancied
that
by
returning
home
he
might
regain
confidence
he
longed
to
rid
himself
of
the
conviction
that
he
was
set
aside
by
some
fate
or
other
call
it
god
or
not
as
you
please
he
thought
that
he
hurt
all
those
whom
he
loved
when
his
only
longing
was
to
do
them
good
he
used
suddenly
to
leave
his
friends
because
he
thought
that
he
was
doing
them
harm
it
was
as
though
he
heard
some
power
saying
to
him
i
marked
you
out
for
my
own
in
the
beginning
and
you
ca
escape
me
you
may
struggle
as
you
like
until
you
surrender
everything
shall
turn
to
dust
in
your
hands
he
came
back
to
england
determined
to
assert
his
independence
he
gazed
now
at
the
placidity
of
garrick
street
with
the
intensity
of
some
challenging
stand
and
deliver
all
that
the
street
had
to
give
for
the
moment
was
a
bishop
and
an
actor
mounting
the
steps
of
the
garrick
club
an
old
lady
with
a
black
bonnet
and
a
a
young
man
in
a
hurry
and
a
failure
selling
bootlaces
none
of
them
could
be
expected
to
offer
reassurance
to
martin
none
of
these
noticed
him
but
an
intelligent
observer
had
such
a
stranger
to
garrick
street
been
present
might
have
found
that
gaze
of
interest
martin
physical
solidity
could
not
entirely
veil
the
worried
uncertain
glance
that
flashed
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
little
reassuring
sigh
was
gone
the
door
opened
a
girl
looked
for
a
moment
into
the
street
he
passed
inside
having
stumbled
up
the
dark
stairs
pushed
back
their
private
entrance
hung
up
his
coat
in
the
little
hall
with
a
deliberate
effort
he
shook
off
the
suspicions
that
had
during
the
last
moments
troubled
him
and
prepared
to
meet
his
mother
and
sister
because
he
had
a
happy
easy
and
affectionate
temperament
absence
always
gilded
his
friends
with
gifts
and
qualities
that
their
presence
only
too
often
denied
his
years
abroad
had
given
him
a
picture
of
his
mother
and
sister
that
the
few
weeks
of
his
return
had
already
dimmed
and
obscured
his
mother
weekly
letters
had
during
ten
long
years
built
up
an
image
of
her
as
the
dearest
old
lady
in
the
world
he
had
always
since
a
child
seen
her
in
a
detached
way
his
deep
and
permanent
relations
had
been
with
his
father
but
those
letters
of
which
he
had
now
a
deep
and
carefully
cherished
pile
gave
him
a
most
charming
picture
of
her
they
had
not
been
clever
nor
deep
nor
indeed
very
interesting
but
they
had
been
affectionate
and
tender
with
all
the
gentleness
of
the
figure
that
he
remembered
sitting
in
its
lace
cap
beside
the
fire
after
three
weeks
of
home
life
he
was
compelled
to
confess
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
his
mother
his
intuitions
about
people
were
not
in
fact
of
a
very
penetrating
character
his
mother
appeared
to
all
her
world
as
a
sweet
old
lady
but
even
martin
could
already
perceive
that
was
not
in
the
least
what
she
really
was
he
had
seen
her
old
hands
tremble
with
suppressed
temper
on
the
very
day
after
his
arrival
he
had
seen
her
old
lips
white
with
anger
because
the
maid
had
brought
her
the
wrong
shawl
old
ladies
must
of
course
have
their
fancies
but
his
mother
had
some
fixed
and
fierce
purpose
in
her
life
that
was
quite
beyond
his
powers
of
penetration
it
might
of
course
have
something
to
do
with
her
attachment
to
his
father
attached
martin
could
see
that
she
was
but
at
the
same
time
completely
and
eternally
outside
her
husband
spiritual
life
that
might
have
been
perhaps
in
the
first
place
by
her
own
desire
she
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
with
all
that
nonsense
but
certainly
all
these
years
with
him
had
worked
upon
her
she
was
not
perhaps
so
sure
now
that
it
was
all
nonsense
she
wanted
it
might
be
a
closer
alliance
with
him
which
she
could
not
have
because
she
had
once
rejected
the
chance
of
it

did
not
know
he
was
aware
that
there
was
a
great
deal
going
on
in
the
house
that
he
did
not
fathom
amy
his
sister
knew
there
was
an
alliance
between
his
mother
and
his
sister
deep
and
strong
as
he
could
see
he
did
not
yet
know
that
it
was
founded
very
largely
on
dislike
and
fear
of
himself
how
fantastic
these
theories
of
fire
and
passion
must
seem
he
amused
himself
by
considering
to
any
one
who
knew
his
mother
only
from
the
outside
she
was
sitting
as
always
in
her
little
pink
and
white
chintz
a
bright
fire
burning
and
a
canary
singing
in
a
cage
beside
the
window
the
rest
of
the
house
was
ugly
and
strangely
uninhabited
as
though
the
warlocks
had
merely
pitched
their
tents
for
a
night
and
were
moving
forward
but
this
little
room
close
smelling
of
musk
and
sweet
biscuits
a
silver
box
with
biscuits
in
it
stood
on
a
little
table
near
the
old
lady
with
its
pretty
pink
curtains
its
canary
and
its
heavy
and
softly
closing
door
was
like
a
place
enclosed
dedicated
to
the
world
and
ruled
by
a
remorseless
spirit
of
comfort
warlock
was
only
sixty
years
of
age
but
she
had
a
number
of
years
ago
declared
herself
an
invalid
and
now
never
unless
she
drove
on
a
very
fine
afternoon
left
the
house
whether
she
were
truly
an
invalid
nobody
knew
she
presented
certainly
a
most
healthy
appearance
with
her
cheeks
her
hair
her
firm
bosom
rising
and
falling
with
such
gentle
regularity
beneath
the
tight
and
shining
black
silk
that
covered
it
her
clear
bright
eyes
like
shining
glass
she
always
sat
in
a
deep
covered
with
the
chintz
of
the
curtains
and
filled
with
plump
pillows
of
pink
silk
a
white
filmy
shawl
was
spread
over
her
knees
at
her
throat
was
a
little
bright
coquettish
blue
bow
that
added
amazingly
to
the
innocent
charm
of
her
old
age
on
her
white
hair
crinkled
and
arranged
as
though
it
were
some
ornament
not
quite
a
wig
but
still
apart
from
the
rest
of
her
body
she
wore
a
lace
cap
she
was
fond
of
knitting
she
made
warm
woollen
comforters
and
underclothing
for
the
children
of
the
poor
she
was
immensely
fond
of
conversation
being
of
an
inquisitive
nature
but
above
all
was
she
fond
of
eating
this
covetousness
of
food
had
grown
on
her
as
her
years
had
increased
the
thought
of
foods
of
various
kinds
filled
many
hours
of
her
day
and
the
desire
for
pleasant
things
to
eat
was
the
motive
of
many
of
her
most
deliberate
actions
she
cherished
warmly
and
secretly
this
little
lust
of
hers
none
of
the
family
was
aware
of
the
grip
that
the
desire
had
upon
her
nor
of
the
speed
with
which
the
desire
was
growing
she
did
not
ask
directly
for
the
things
that
she
liked
but
manoeuvred
with
little
plots
and
intrigues
to
obtain
them
the
cook
in
the
warlock
household
had
neither
art
nor
science
at
her
disposal
but
as
it
happened
old
warlock
lusted
after
very
simple
things
she
loved
her
heart
beat
fast
in
her
breast
when
she
thought
of
the
brown
crinkly
skin
of
the
rich
warm
milk
of
a
true
also
she
loved
hot
buttered
toast
very
buttery
so
that
it
soaked
your
fingers
also
pudding
with
gravy
rich
and
dark
and
its
white
covering
thick
and
heavy
she
also
loved
hot
and
sweet
tea
and
the
little
cakes
that
amy
sometimes
bought
red
and
yellow
and
pink
held
in
white
paper
also
which
alas
only
came
at
christmastime
and
which
scarcely
ever
came
at
all
this
vice
of
which
she
was
almost
triumphantly
conscious
as
though
it
were
a
proof
of
her
enduring
vitality
she
clutched
eagerly
to
herself
she
did
not
wish
that
any
human
being
should
perceive
it
of
her
husband
she
was
not
afraid
it
would
never
possibly
occur
to
him
that
food
was
of
importance
to
any
one
amy
might
discover
what
she
pleased
she
was
in
strong
alliance
with
her
mother
and
would
never
betray
her
her
fear
was
of
martin
she
feared
very
deeply
his
influence
upon
her
husband
during
martin
absence
she
and
amy
had
managed
very
successfully
to
have
the
house
as
they
wished
it
john
warlock
the
master
had
been
too
deeply
occupied
with
the
affairs
of
the
soul
to
be
concerned
also
with
the
affairs
of
the
body
she
had
she
believed
exercised
an
increasing
influence
over
him
she
had
always
loved
him
with
a
fierce
and
selfish
love
but
now
when
he
was
nearly
seventy
and
to
both
of
them
only
a
few
years
of
earthly
ambition
could
remain
she
desired
with
all
the
urgent
ferocity
of
a
human
being
through
whose
fingers
the
last
sands
of
his
opportunity
are
slipping
to
seize
and
hold
and
have
him
entirely
hers
he
had
always
eluded
her
although
he
had
once
certainly
loved
her
with
at
any
rate
a
semblance
of
earthly
passion
his
spiritual
life
had
always
come
between
them
holding
him
from
her
helping
him
to
escape
when
he
pleased
tantalising
sometimes
maddening
too
she
was
certainly
now
not
so
ready
to
dismiss
that
spiritual
life
as
once
she
had
been
she
was
herself
an
old
heathen
for
herself
she
believed
in
nothing
but
her
earthly
appetites
and
desires
but
for
him
and
for
others
there
might
be
something
in
it
and
perhaps
some
day
some
dreadful
thing
would
occur
a
chariot
of
fire
descend
upon
the
chapel
and
some
sort
of
a
fierce
and
hostile
god
deliver
judgment
she
only
hoped
that
she
would
be
dead
before
then
meanwhile
she
and
amy
had
undoubtedly
during
these
last
years
increased
their
influence
over
him
he
was
not
aware
of
it
but
as
he
was
growing
now
older
and
weaker
he
had
had
trouble
with
his
heart
he
inevitably
depended
more
upon
them
the
old
lady
began
to
count
upon
her
triumph
then
came
martin
return
she
had
forgotten
martin
it
is
true
that
she
had
written
to
him
every
week
during
his
long
absence
but
her
letters
had
been
all
part
of
the
dear
old
lady
habit
which
was
put
on
by
her
just
as
an
actress
prepares
herself
nightly
for
a
character
in
which
she
knows
she
is
the
greatest
possible
success
thank
you
very
much
smith
no
we
not
heard
from
martin
now
for
three
weeks
careless
boy
i
always
write
myself
every
week
so
that
he
may
have
at
any
rate
one
little
word
from
home
she
had
never
felt
that
she
had
any
real
share
in
his
life
he
had
always
belonged
to
his
father
nor
was
she
a
woman
who
cared
about
children
martin
had
long
ago
become
to
her
simply
an
opportunity
for
further
decoration
since
his
return
it
had
been
quite
another
affair
in
one
moment
she
had
seen
her
power
over
her
husband
shrivel
and
disappear
martin
was
home
again
martin
must
be
here
martin
must
be
there
martin
must
see
this
martin
must
do
this
she
had
seen
before
in
earlier
days
the
force
of
her
husband
passion
when
it
was
roused
there
was
something
now
in
his
reception
of
their
son
that
terrified
her
she
had
at
once
perceived
that
amy
was
as
deeply
moved
as
she
the
girl
plain
awkward
silent
morose
had
always
adored
her
father
but
she
had
never
known
how
to
approach
him
she
was
not
clever
she
had
not
been
able
to
enter
into
his
life
although
she
would
have
done
anything
that
he
desired
of
her
what
she
had
suffered
during
those
early
years
when
as
a
little
ugly
girl
she
had
watched
her
brother
accepted
received
into
the
brotherhood
praised
for
his
wisdom
his
intimacy
with
god
his
marvellous
saintly
promise
praised
for
these
things
when
she
had
known
all
his
weaknesses
how
he
had
slipped
away
to
a
when
he
was
only
fourteen
and
smoked
and
drank
there
how
he
had
laughed
at
thurston
dropping
of
his
h
or
at
miss
avies
prayer
meetings
no
one
ever
knew
what
in
those
years
she
had
thought
of
her
brother
then
after
martin
had
flung
it
all
away
and
escaped
abroad
she
had
begun
slowly
painfully
but
with
dogged
persistence
to
make
herself
indispensable
to
her
father
martin
she
had
put
out
of
her
mind
he
would
never
return
or
at
least
the
interval
of
his
departure
should
have
been
severe
enough
to
separate
him
for
ever
from
his
father
in
a
moment
glance
in
a
clasp
of
the
hand
in
a
flash
of
the
eye
she
had
seen
that
love
leap
up
in
her
father
heart
as
strong
as
ever
it
had
been
every
day
of
martin
residence
in
the
house
had
added
fire
to
that
love
she
was
a
good
woman
she
struggled
hard
to
beat
down
her
jealousy
she
prayed
she
lay
for
hours
at
night
struggling
with
her
sins
if
martin
had
been
worthy
if
he
had
shown
love
in
return
but
from
the
bottom
of
her
soul
as
the
days
increased
she
despised
him
despised
him
for
his
light
heart
his
care
of
worldly
things
his
utter
lack
of
comprehension
of
their
father
his
scorn
even
now
but
badly
concealed
of
all
the
sanctities
that
she
had
in
reverence
therefore
she
drew
near
to
her
mother
and
the
two
of
them
watched
and
waited
his
mother
was
knitting
she
lifted
to
him
her
pink
wrinkled
face
and
her
spectacles
balanced
on
the
end
of
her
nose
smiled
the
smile
of
the
dearest
old
lady
in
the
world
well
dear
and
have
you
had
a
pleasant
day
all
right
mother
thank
you
funny
thing
met
a
man
in
the
street
had
seen
for
five
years
saw
him
last
in
rio
funny
thing
well
we
lunched
together
not
a
bad
fellow
seen
a
thing
or
two
he
has
warlock
counted
her
stitches
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
how
nice
for
you
dear
what
was
his
name
thompson
i
say
martin
suddenly
raised
his
head
as
though
he
heard
something
where
amy
changing
she
been
paying
a
call
on
the
miss
cardinals
thought
it
would
be
polite
because
of
the
new
six
seven
eight
and
nine
what
did
she
think
of
her
of
whom
dear
of
the
niece
oh
i
do
think
she
liked
her
very
much
she
said
that
she
was
plain
and
silent
and
looked
cross
amy
thought
oh
yes
amy
would
his
face
as
was
his
way
when
he
was
vexed
flushed
very
slowly
the
deeper
red
rising
through
the
until
ceasing
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
it
left
a
white
line
beneath
his
hair
she
is
cross
a
bit
i
do
know
dear
it
is
my
opinion
i
only
tell
you
what
amy
said
people
here
do
seem
to
like
her
smith
was
telling
me
yesterday
that
she
so
difficult
to
talk
to
and
seems
to
know
nothing
about
anything
poor
girl
mrs
smith
he
swung
his
body
on
his
hips
indignantly
a
lot
she
knows
about
anything
i
hate
that
woman
and
her
chattering
daughter
well
dear
i
do
know
i
sure
smith
always
seems
to
me
very
kind
he
looked
at
her
as
though
he
had
suddenly
remembered
something
i
say
is
it
true
what
amy
says
that
i
woke
you
up
this
morning
when
i
went
out
by
banging
my
door
i
sure
you
amy
should
say
such
things
and
if
you
did
what
does
it
matter
i
sleep
so
badly
that
half
an
hour
more
or
less
makes
very
little
difference
well
she
says
so
he
went
on
dropping
his
voice
i
say
mother
what
the
matter
with
amy
why
she
so
sick
with
me
i
have
done
anything
to
offend
her
have
i
of
course
not
what
a
silly
boy
you
are
martin
nine
ten
eleven
there
that
enough
for
this
evening
i
finish
it
in
another
day
you
must
mind
amy
martin
she
is
always
very
well
the
door
opened
and
amy
came
in
she
was
a
tall
gaunt
woman
who
looked
a
great
deal
older
than
her
brother
she
did
not
make
the
best
of
herself
brushing
her
thin
black
hair
straight
back
from
her
bony
forehead
she
had
a
habit
of
half
closing
her
eyes
when
she
peered
at
some
one
as
though
she
could
not
see
she
should
long
ago
have
worn
spectacles
but
from
some
strange
vanity
had
always
refused
to
do
so
every
year
her
sight
grew
worse
she
was
wearing
now
a
dress
of
black
silk
very
badly
made
cut
to
display
her
long
skinny
neck
and
bony
shoulders
she
wore
her
clothes
as
though
she
struggled
between
a
disdain
for
such
vanities
and
a
desire
to
appear
attractive
her
manner
of
twisting
her
eyelids
and
wrinkling
her
nose
gave
her
a
peevish
expression
but
behind
that
there
was
a
hint
of
pathos
a
glimpse
of
a
soul
that
desired
friendship
and
affection
she
was
very
tall
and
there
was
something
masculine
in
the
long
angularity
of
her
limbs
she
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
broad
and
ruddy
martin
there
was
however
something
in
the
eyes
of
each
some
sudden
surprised
almost
visionary
flash
that
came
and
went
that
showed
them
to
be
the
children
of
the
same
father
to
warlock
they
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
amy
stopped
when
she
saw
her
brother
as
though
she
had
not
expected
him
to
be
there
well
martin
she
said
then
came
forward
and
sat
in
a
chair
opposite
her
mother
thurston
coming
to
suppar
she
said
martin
frowned
oh
hang
it
what
for
he
cried
he
taking
me
to
miss
aries
bible
meeting
amy
answered
coldly
what
a
baby
you
are
about
people
martin
i
should
have
thought
all
your
living
abroad
so
much
would
have
made
you
understanding
but
you
like
the
rest
you
must
have
every
one
cut
to
the
same
pattern
martin
looked
up
for
a
moment
as
though
he
would
answer
angrily
then
he
controlled
himself
and
said
laughing
i
suppose
i
have
my
prejudices
like
every
one
else
i
daresay
thurston
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
but
we
do
like
one
another
and
there
an
end
of
it
everybody
ca
like
everybody
amy
why
even
you
do
like
every
one
no
i
do
she
answered
shortly
she
looked
for
an
instant
at
her
mother
martin
caught
the
glance
that
passed
between
them
and
suddenly
the
discomfort
of
which
he
had
been
aware
as
he
stood
half
an
hour
before
in
the
street
returned
to
him
with
redoubled
force
what
was
the
matter
with
everybody
what
had
he
done
well
i
go
and
change
he
said
dinner
will
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
dear
said
his
mother
i
be
in
time
all
right
he
said
at
the
door
he
almost
ran
into
thurston
this
gentleman
had
been
described
on
some
earlier
occasion
by
an
unfriendly
observer
as
the
suburban
savonarola
he
was
tall
and
extremely
thin
with
a
bony
pointed
face
that
was
in
some
lights
grey
and
in
others
white
he
had
the
excited
staring
eyes
of
a
fanatic
and
his
hair
now
very
scanty
was
plastered
over
his
head
in
black
shining
streaks
he
wore
a
rather
faded
black
suit
a
white
low
collar
and
a
white
bow
tie
he
had
a
habit
at
moments
of
stress
of
cracking
his
fingers
he
had
a
very
pronounced
cockney
accent
when
he
was
excited
at
other
times
he
struggled
against
this
with
some
success
he
passed
from
brooding
silences
into
sudden
bursts
of
declamation
with
such
abruptness
that
strangers
thought
him
very
eloquent
when
he
was
excited
the
colour
ran
into
his
nose
as
though
he
had
been
drinking
and
often
his
ears
were
red
his
history
was
simple
the
son
of
a
small
draper
in
streatham
he
had
at
an
early
age
joined
himself
to
an
american
revivalist
called
harper
when
after
some
six
years
of
successful
enterprise
harper
had
been
imprisoned
for
forgery
young
william
thurston
had
attached
himself
to
a
christian
science
chapel
in
hoxton
then
somewhere
about
he
had
met
miss
avies
at
a
revivalist
meeting
in
the
albert
hall
and
fascinated
by
her
ardent
spirit
transferred
his
services
to
the
kingscote
brethren
he
had
now
risen
to
a
position
of
great
importance
in
the
chapel
it
was
known
that
he
disagreed
profoundly
with
his
leader
on
some
vital
questions
and
it
was
thought
that
he
might
at
a
later
date
definitely
secede
and
conduct
a
party
of
his
own
certainly
he
had
exceptional
energies
and
gifts
of
exhortation
and
invective
not
to
be
despised
martin
politely
wished
him
good
evening
and
escaped
to
his
room
as
he
changed
his
clothes
he
tried
to
translate
into
definite
facts
his
vague
discomfort
one
he
hated
that
swine
thurston
two
amy
was
vexed
with
him
what
strange
impossible
creatures
women
were
third
and
by
far
the
most
important
of
them
all
his
father
wanted
to
talk
to
him
he
knew
very
well
that
this
talk
had
been
preparing
for
him
ever
since
his
return
from
abroad
he
dreaded
it
oh
he
dreaded
it
most
horribly
he
loved
his
father
but
with
a
love
that
had
in
it
elements
of
fear
timidity
every
possible
sort
of
awkwardness
moreover
he
was
helpless
ever
since
that
first
day
when
as
a
tiny
child
of
four
or
five
he
had
awakened
to
behold
that
figure
enormous
in
a
long
summoning
god
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
candle
flickering
fantastic
shadows
on
to
the
wall
behind
them
martin
had
been
weak
as
putty
in
his
father
hands
against
other
men
he
could
stand
up
against
that
strange
company
of
fears
affections
superstitions
shadowy
terrors
dim
expectations
that
his
father
presented
to
him
he
could
do
nothing
well
that
conversation
had
to
come
some
time
he
must
show
that
he
was
a
man
now
moulded
by
the
world
with
his
own
beliefs
purposes
resolves
but
if
he
did
not
love
him
how
much
easier
it
would
be
when
he
went
downstairs
he
found
the
old
man
in
the
little
pink
he
looked
tired
and
worn
martin
remembered
with
alarm
the
things
that
he
had
heard
recently
about
his
father
heart
he
glanced
up
and
the
older
man
hand
fastened
on
his
shoulder
they
stood
there
side
by
side
after
a
few
minutes
they
all
went
in
to
supper
thurston
nose
was
flushed
with
the
success
of
the
mission
from
which
he
had
just
returned
he
had
been
one
of
a
number
whose
aim
it
had
been
during
the
preceding
week
to
bring
light
and
happiness
into
the
lives
of
the
inhabitants
of
putney
they
had
been
obviously
appreciated
as
the
collection
for
the
week
had
amounted
to
between
seventy
and
eighty
pounds
a
proper
share
of
this
fine
result
thurston
naturally
appropriated
to
his
own
efforts
his
long
tapering
fingers
were
not
so
clean
as
they
might
have
been
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
waving
them
in
the
air
and
pointing
them
at
imaginary
putney
citizens
whom
he
evoked
in
support
of
his
statements
we
a
reelly
thumpin
meeting
on
thursday
town
hall
one
for
the
women
in
the
small
hand
one
for
the
men
in
the
main
hall
almost
no
opposition
you
might
say
and
when
it
came
to
the
hymn
singing
it
fairly
took
the
roof
off
a
lot
of
stopped
afterwards
one
lad
of
eighteen
or
so
is
coming
over
to
us
butcher
apprentice
says
felt
the
lord
pressing
him
a
long
way
back
but
the
flesh
held
him
might
work
him
up
into
a
very
useful
lad
with
the
lord
help
thank
you
warlock
i
will
try
a
bit
more
of
that
cold
beef
if
you
mind
pretty
place
putney
ever
been
there
warlock
ah
you
should
go
amy
warlock
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
otherwise
it
must
be
confessed
thurston
audience
was
somewhat
inattentive
warlock
mind
was
obviously
elsewhere
he
passed
his
hand
through
his
beard
his
eyes
staring
at
the
thurston
noticing
this
tried
another
topic
what
you
heard
warlock
about
the
new
miss
cardinal
i
seen
her
yet
myself
warlock
who
had
just
given
herself
a
little
piece
of
beef
some
potato
and
some
spinach
and
was
arranging
these
delicacies
with
the
greatest
care
upon
her
plate
just
smiled
without
raising
her
eyes
amy
answered
i
seen
her
i
was
there
this
afternoon
i
ca
say
that
i
found
her
very
interesting
in
fact
she
never
opened
her
mouth
all
the
afternoon
caroline
smith
tells
me
that
she
knows
nothing
at
all
seen
nothing
been
nowhere
i
should
think
dear
dear
said
thurston
with
a
gratified
sigh
is
it
so
reelly
martin
looked
across
at
his
sister
indignantly
trust
one
woman
about
another
he
said
just
because
she
does
chatter
like
a
magpie
you
concluded
she
got
nothing
to
say
it
even
conceivable
that
she
found
you
dull
amy
amy
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
penetrating
glance
that
in
some
undefined
way
increased
his
irritation
it
quite
possible
she
said
quietly
but
i
do
think
even
you
martin
can
call
her
handsome
as
to
her
intelligence
she
never
gave
me
a
chance
of
judging
i
been
there
several
times
said
martin
hotly
i
like
her
immensely
he
felt
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
that
it
had
been
a
foolish
thing
to
say
he
saw
thurston
smile
in
the
pause
that
followed
he
felt
as
though
he
had
with
a
gesture
of
the
hand
flung
a
stone
into
a
pool
of
chatter
and
scandal
whose
ripples
might
spread
far
beyond
his
control
at
that
moment
he
hated
his
sister
i
did
know
you
knew
her
so
well
dear
said
his
mother
i
do
know
her
he
said
i
only
seen
her
three
times
but
she
ought
to
be
given
her
chance
it
ca
be
much
fun
for
her
coming
here
where
she
knows
no
one
after
her
father
suddenly
dying
i
believe
she
was
all
alone
with
him
he
had
expected
his
father
to
defend
her
he
remembered
that
he
had
apparently
liked
her
but
his
father
said
nothing
there
was
an
awkward
and
uncomfortable
pause
after
supper
thurston
rubbed
his
hands
helped
amy
warlock
into
her
cloak
said
to
the
company
in
general
good
night
should
be
a
very
full
meeting
well
well
thank
you
for
your
kindness
warlock
i
sure
the
door
was
closed
warlock
retired
into
her
bedroom
the
house
was
left
to
martin
and
his
father
warlock
room
was
hideous
it
opened
somewhat
ironically
out
of
warlock
pink
a
huge
and
exceedingly
ugly
american
desk
took
up
much
of
the
room
there
were
bookshelves
into
which
books
had
been
piled
commentaries
on
the
bible
volumes
of
sermons
pamphlets
tattered
copies
of
old
religious
magazines
a
bare
carpet
displayed
holes
and
rents
the
fireplace
was
grim
with
dirty
pieces
of
paper
and
untidy
shavings
in
the
midst
of
this
disorder
there
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
against
the
faded
grey
a
fine
copy
of
raphael
transfiguration
warlock
lighted
a
candle
and
the
flame
flickered
with
changing
colours
upon
the
surface
it
had
been
given
to
john
warlock
many
years
before
by
an
old
lady
who
heard
him
preach
and
had
been
for
a
week
converted
but
on
his
demand
that
she
should
give
her
wealth
to
the
poor
and
fling
aside
her
passion
for
musical
comedy
left
him
with
indignation
the
picture
had
remained
it
hung
there
now
crooked
on
its
cord
john
warlock
was
unconscious
of
the
dust
and
disorder
that
surrounded
him
his
own
passion
for
personal
cleanliness
sprang
from
the
early
days
with
his
father
to
whom
bodily
cleanliness
had
been
part
of
a
fanatical
mysticism
partly
also
by
reason
of
that
early
training
sloth
drunkenness
immorality
had
no
power
over
him
and
of
the
whole
actual
world
that
surrounded
him
he
was
very
little
conscious
except
that
he
hated
towns
and
longed
always
for
air
and
space
so
that
the
windows
were
open
one
room
was
to
him
as
another
he
had
often
during
his
work
with
the
members
of
his
community
been
conscious
of
his
ignorance
of
the
impulses
and
powers
that
went
up
to
make
the
ordinary
sensual
physical
life
of
the
normal
man
his
own
troubles
trials
failures
were
so
utterly
of
another
kind
that
in
this
other
world
his
imagination
refused
to
aid
him
this
had
often
deeply
distressed
him
and
made
him
timid
and
shy
in
his
dealings
with
men
and
women
it
was
this
more
than
anything
else
that
held
him
back
from
the
ambition
to
proselytise
how
could
he
go
forth
and
challenge
souls
when
he
could
not
understand
nor
feel
their
difficulties
more
and
more
as
his
years
advanced
had
he
retired
into
himself
into
his
own
mystical
world
of
communion
with
a
god
who
drew
ever
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
he
humbled
himself
before
men
he
did
not
believe
himself
better
than
they
because
he
had
not
yielded
to
their
temptations
but
he
could
not
help
them
his
tongue
was
tied
he
was
a
man
cut
off
from
his
fellows
and
he
knew
it
he
had
never
felt
so
impatient
of
his
impotence
as
he
did
for
ten
years
he
had
been
waiting
for
this
interview
with
his
son
and
now
that
it
was
come
he
was
timid
and
afraid
as
though
he
had
been
opposed
by
a
stranger
he
had
always
known
that
martin
would
return
it
had
been
his
one
worldly
ambition
and
prayer
to
have
him
at
his
side
again
when
he
had
thought
and
dreamt
of
the
time
that
was
coming
he
had
thought
that
it
would
be
simple
enough
to
win
the
boy
back
to
the
old
allegiance
and
faith
to
which
he
had
once
been
bound
meanwhile
the
boy
had
grown
into
a
man
here
was
a
new
martin
deep
in
experiences
desires
ambitions
of
which
his
father
could
have
no
perception
even
in
the
moment
that
he
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
losing
his
son
he
was
aware
also
of
the
deep
almost
fanatical
resolve
to
keep
him
to
hold
him
at
all
costs
this
was
to
be
the
test
of
his
whole
earthly
life
he
seemed
as
he
sat
there
looking
across
at
his
boy
to
challenge
god
himself
to
take
him
from
him
it
was
as
though
he
said
this
reward
at
least
i
have
a
right
to
ask
i
demand
it
martin
on
his
side
was
conscious
of
a
profound
discomfort
he
had
increasingly
as
the
years
had
passed
wished
to
take
life
easily
and
pleasantly
suddenly
now
another
world
rose
up
before
him
yes
another
world
he
was
not
fool
enough
to
dismiss
it
simply
because
it
did
not
resemble
his
own
moreover
it
had
been
once
his
and
this
was
increasingly
borne
in
upon
him
but
it
all
seemed
to
him
now
incredibly
old
childish
and
even
fantastic
as
though
here
in
the
middle
of
london
he
had
suddenly
stepped
into
a
little
wood
with
a
witch
a
cottage
and
a
boiling
cauldron
such
things
could
not
frighten
of
course
he
was
no
longer
a
child
and
yet
because
he
had
once
been
frightened
some
impression
of
alarm
and
dismay
hovered
over
him
during
all
his
normal
years
abroad
he
had
forgotten
the
power
of
superstition
of
dreams
and
omens
he
knew
now
as
he
faced
his
father
that
the
power
was
real
enough
they
talked
for
a
little
while
of
ordinary
things
the
candle
flame
jumped
and
fell
the
shavings
rustled
strangely
in
the
fireplace
the
transfiguration
swung
a
little
on
its
cord
the
colour
still
lingering
at
its
heart
as
the
rest
of
the
room
moved
restlessly
under
the
ebb
and
flow
of
black
shadows
then
the
candle
suddenly
blew
out
a
lamp
will
be
better
said
warlock
he
left
the
room
and
martin
sat
there
in
the
darkness
haunted
by
he
knew
not
what
anticipations
the
light
was
brought
they
drew
closer
together
sitting
in
the
little
glossy
pool
the
room
pitch
dark
around
them
well
martin
at
last
warlock
said
i
want
to
hear
so
many
things
our
first
time
together
alone
there
is
very
much
martin
tried
to
speak
naturally
and
carelessly
i
wrote
about
most
things
in
my
letters
pretty
rotten
letters
i
afraid
he
laughed
and
now
what
do
you
intend
to
do
now
oh
i
do
know
look
around
for
a
bit
there
was
another
long
pause
then
warlock
began
again
when
i
ask
about
your
life
my
boy
i
do
mean
where
you
lived
how
earned
your
living
i
do
know
all
that
you
been
very
good
about
writing
but
your
real
life
what
you
been
thinking
about
things
how
you
feel
about
everything
well
father
i
do
know
one
had
much
time
for
thinking
you
know
no
one
did
much
thinking
in
rio
when
i
was
in
the
bermudas
there
was
a
fellow
yes
but
tell
me
about
yourself
then
with
a
desperate
effort
he
broke
out
father
you
be
badly
disappointed
in
me
i
been
feeling
it
coming
all
the
time
i
ca
help
it
i
just
like
any
one
else
i
want
to
have
a
good
time
one
only
young
once
i
awfully
sorry
i
want
to
please
you
in
any
way
i
can
but
but
it
all
gone
all
that
early
part
it
simply
one
childhood
that
finished
with
and
it
ca
come
back
his
father
said
quietly
never
martin
voice
was
almost
a
cry
as
though
he
were
defying
something
we
are
very
weak
against
god
will
his
father
said
still
quietly
as
though
it
were
not
he
that
was
speaking
but
some
voice
in
the
shadow
behind
him
you
are
not
your
own
master
martin
i
am
my
own
master
martin
answered
passionately
i
have
been
my
own
master
for
ten
years
i
not
done
anything
very
fine
with
my
life
i
know
i
just
like
any
one
else
but
i
found
my
feet
i
can
look
after
myself
against
anybody
and
i
independent
of
every
one
and
of
everything
his
father
drew
a
little
closer
to
him
of
course
he
said
i
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
expect
that
you
would
come
back
to
us
just
as
you
left
us
i
know
that
you
must
have
your
own
life
and
be
free
so
much
as
any
of
us
are
free
at
all
then
after
a
little
pause
what
are
your
plans
what
are
you
going
to
do
well
answered
martin
hesitating
i
have
exactly
settled
you
know
i
might
take
a
small
share
in
some
business
go
into
the
city
then
at
other
times
i
feel
i
should
like
being
cooped
up
in
a
town
after
the
life
i
led
sometimes
this
last
month
i
felt
i
could
breathe
it
was
though
are
you
all
the
chimneys
were
going
to
tumble
in
when
you
out
on
a
field
you
know
where
you
are
you
so
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
little
farm
somewhere
in
the
south
devonshire
or
glebeshire
and
then
i
marry
of
course
a
girl
who
like
that
kind
of
life
and
would
find
it
dull
there
be
plenty
of
work
a
healthy
life
for
children
right
away
from
these
towns
that
my
sort
of
idea
father
but
of
course
one
does
know
martin
trailed
off
into
inconsequent
words
it
was
as
though
his
father
were
waiting
for
him
to
commit
himself
and
would
then
suddenly
leap
upon
him
with
there
now
you
betrayed
yourself
i
caught
you
and
he
had
simply
nothing
to
betray
nothing
to
conceal
but
anything
was
better
than
these
pauses
during
which
the
threats
and
anticipations
piled
up
and
up
making
a
monstrous
figure
out
of
exactly
nothing
at
all
it
was
not
enough
to
tell
himself
that
between
every
father
and
son
there
were
restraints
and
hesitations
a
division
cleft
by
the
remembrance
of
the
time
when
one
had
commanded
and
the
other
obeyed
there
were
other
elements
here
for
one
the
element
of
an
old
affection
that
had
once
been
at
the
very
root
of
the
boy
soul
and
was
now
in
the
strangest
way
creeping
back
to
him
as
an
old
familiar
but
forgotten
form
might
creep
out
of
the
dark
and
sit
at
his
feet
and
clasp
his
knees
well
said
john
warlock
that
very
pleasant
you
must
feel
very
grateful
to
your
aunt
rachel
martin
she
given
you
the
opportunity
of
doing
what
you
like
with
your
life
she
spoke
to
me
about
it
before
she
died
she
spoke
to
you
about
it
yes
she
told
me
that
she
did
it
because
she
wanted
to
bring
you
back
to
me
she
knew
of
my
love
for
you
we
often
talked
of
you
together
she
was
a
faithful
servant
of
god
she
believed
that
god
meant
to
bring
you
through
her
back
into
his
arms
i
might
not
have
come
martin
said
with
a
sudden
anger
that
surprised
himself
she
made
no
conditions
i
might
have
gone
on
with
my
life
there
abroad
i
am
free
to
lead
my
own
life
where
and
how
i
please
quite
free
his
father
answered
gently
but
she
knew
that
you
would
come
of
course
you
are
your
own
master
martin
no
but
it
must
be
quite
clear
martin
cried
the
excitement
rising
in
him
as
he
spoke
he
leaned
forward
almost
touching
his
chair
i
not
bound
to
any
one
by
this
money
it
was
awfully
jolly
of
aunt
rachel
i
never
forget
her
but
i
free
i
have
got
to
say
that
i
believe
things
when
i
do
or
that
i
think
things
that
she
thought
just
because
she
did
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
father
but
you
know
that
it
must
have
seemed
to
me
pretty
odd
coming
back
after
all
these
years
and
finding
you
all
in
the
same
place
doing
the
same
things
believing
in
the
same
things
just
like
years
ago
i
seen
the
world
a
bit
i
can
tell
you
russia
china
japan
america
north
and
south
india
you
believe
as
far
as
you
can
see
what
are
you
to
think
when
in
every
country
that
you
come
to
you
see
people
believing
in
different
things
they
ca
all
be
right
you
know
his
father
said
nothing
but
each
thinks
he
right
and
each
hates
the
other
then
when
i
came
back
and
saw
a
fellow
like
that
man
thurston
preaching
and
laying
down
the
law
well
it
seemed
odd
enough
that
any
one
could
be
taken
in
by
it
i
hope
i
do
hurt
you
father
only
that
what
you
want
is
it
to
have
it
out
quite
plainly
his
father
still
very
gently
and
hesitating
as
though
he
found
it
difficult
to
catch
the
words
that
he
wished
his
voice
had
still
the
remoteness
of
some
one
speaking
who
was
far
from
them
both
said
you
think
it
odd
martin
when
you
know
how
often
i
have
to
preach
and
speak
in
public
that
i
should
find
it
hard
to
talk
but
i
never
with
any
man
alone
could
find
words
easily
i
know
so
little
it
is
god
punishment
for
some
selfish
nervousness
and
shyness
in
me
that
even
now
when
i
am
an
old
man
i
can
not
speak
as
one
man
to
another
there
was
once
i
remember
a
young
man
who
had
heard
me
preach
and
was
moved
by
my
words
and
begged
to
see
me
in
private
he
came
one
evening
he
was
tempted
to
commit
a
terrible
sin
he
depended
upon
me
to
save
him
and
i
could
say
nothing
i
struggled
i
prayed
but
it
was
incredible
to
me
that
any
man
could
be
tempted
to
such
a
thing
i
spoke
only
conventional
words
that
meant
nothing
he
went
away
from
me
and
his
lost
soul
is
now
upon
me
and
will
always
be
but
martin
what
i
would
say
beyond
everything
is
do
not
let
us
separate
be
free
as
you
must
be
free
as
you
should
be
free
but
stay
with
me
remain
with
me
i
am
an
old
man
i
have
longed
for
you
as
i
think
no
other
father
can
ever
have
longed
for
his
son
they
tell
me
that
i
can
not
live
many
more
years
god
chooses
his
time
be
with
me
martin
for
a
little
while
even
though
i
may
seem
old
to
you
and
foolish
perhaps
things
will
come
back
to
you
that
you
have
long
forgotten
you
were
once
pledged
and
it
was
a
vow
that
is
not
easily
removed
but
it
is
enough
for
the
present
if
you
will
be
with
me
a
little
give
me
some
of
your
time
give
the
old
days
a
chance
to
come
back
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
son
the
sudden
touch
of
the
dry
hot
trembling
skin
filled
martin
heart
with
the
strangest
confusion
of
affection
embarrassment
and
some
familiar
pathos
in
just
that
way
ten
years
before
he
had
felt
his
father
hand
and
had
thought
how
old
he
getting
how
i
shall
miss
him
i
hope
nothing
happens
to
him
in
the
very
balance
of
his
father
sentences
and
the
deliberate
choice
of
words
there
had
been
something
and
remote
from
all
the
life
and
scramble
of
martin
recent
years
now
he
took
his
father
hand
in
his
own
strong
grasp
and
said
gruffly
that
all
right
father
i
not
going
while
you
want
me
you
and
i
always
it
just
the
same
now
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
felt
as
though
he
were
giving
some
pledge
that
was
to
involve
him
in
far
more
than
he
could
see
before
him
then
with
a
happy
sense
that
the
sentimental
part
of
the
conversation
was
over
he
began
to
talk
about
all
kinds
of
things
he
let
himself
go
and
even
after
a
while
began
to
feel
the
whole
thing
really
jolly
and
pleasant
his
father
wanted
waking
up
he
had
been
here
so
long
with
all
these
awful
frumps
brooding
over
one
idea
never
getting
away
from
this
religion
martin
began
to
imagine
himself
very
cleverly
leading
his
father
into
a
normal
natural
life
taking
him
to
see
things
making
him
laugh
it
would
do
his
health
a
world
of
good
then
quite
suddenly
the
old
man
said
and
what
do
you
remember
martin
of
the
old
days
here
the
days
when
you
were
quite
small
when
we
lived
in
mason
street
what
did
martin
remember
he
remembered
a
good
deal
he
was
surprised
when
he
began
to
think
did
he
remember
his
father
suggested
a
scene
a
day
yes
he
remembered
that
his
father
continued
as
though
it
had
been
for
his
own
pleasure
the
scenes
the
hours
returned
with
a
vividness
and
actuality
that
thronged
the
room
he
could
see
mason
street
with
its
grocer
shop
at
the
corner
its
baths
and
public
library
the
sudden
little
black
dips
into
the
areas
as
the
houses
followed
one
another
the
opposite
their
window
that
had
always
excited
him
because
it
leaned
inwards
a
little
as
though
it
would
presently
tumble
he
remembered
the
fat
short
cook
with
the
pink
cotton
dress
who
wheezed
and
blew
so
when
she
had
to
climb
the
stairs
he
remembered
the
rooms
that
would
seem
bare
enough
to
him
now
he
supposed
but
were
then
filled
with
exciting
possibilities
a
little
round
brown
table
his
mother
with
shells
upon
the
cover
a
stuffed
bird
with
bright
blue
feathers
under
a
glass
case
a
screen
with
coloured
pictures
of
battles
and
horses
and
elephants
casted
upon
it
he
remembered
the
exact
sound
that
the
tinkling
bell
made
when
it
summoned
them
to
meals
he
remembered
the
especial
smell
of
beef
and
carpet
that
was
the
he
remembered
a
little
door
of
coloured
glass
on
the
first
landing
a
cupboard
that
had
in
it
sugar
and
apples
a
room
full
of
old
books
piled
high
all
about
the
floor
upon
the
dry
and
dusty
boards
a
thousand
other
things
came
crowding
around
him
then
as
his
father
voice
continued
out
from
the
background
there
came
his
own
figure
a
small
pale
excited
boy
in
short
trousers
he
was
immensely
excited
that
was
the
principal
thing
it
was
evening
the
house
seemed
to
swim
in
candlelight
and
smoke
through
which
things
could
be
seen
only
dimly
something
wonderful
was
about
to
happen
to
him
he
was
in
a
state
of
glory
very
close
to
god
so
close
that
he
could
almost
see
him
sitting
with
his
long
white
beard
in
the
middle
of
a
cloud
watching
martin
with
interest
and
affection
he
was
pleased
with
martin
and
martin
was
pleased
with
himself
at
the
same
time
as
his
pleasure
he
was
aware
that
the
stuff
of
his
new
black
trousers
tickled
his
knees
and
that
he
was
hungry
he
saw
his
small
sister
amy
for
a
moment
and
expressed
quite
effectively
by
a
smile
and
nod
of
the
head
his
immeasurable
superiority
to
her
they
he
and
his
father
drove
in
a
cab
to
the
chapel
of
what
followed
then
he
was
now
less
aware
he
remembered
that
he
was
in
a
small
room
with
two
men
that
they
all
took
off
their
clothes
he
remembered
that
one
man
very
stout
and
red
looked
funny
without
his
clothes
that
they
put
on
long
white
that
his
was
too
long
for
him
and
that
he
tripped
over
it
that
they
all
three
walked
down
the
centre
of
the
chapel
which
was
filled
with
eyes
mouths
and
boots
and
that
he
was
very
conscious
of
his
which
had
never
been
exposed
in
public
before
that
they
came
to
a
round
stone
place
filled
with
water
and
into
this
after
the
two
men
he
was
dipped
that
he
did
scream
from
the
coldness
of
the
water
although
he
wanted
to
that
he
was
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
finally
carried
home
in
an
ecstasy
of
triumph
what
happiness
followed
the
vitality
of
it
swept
down
upon
him
now
so
that
he
seemed
never
to
have
lived
since
then
he
was
the
chosen
of
god
and
every
one
knew
it
what
a
little
prig
and
yet
how
simple
it
had
all
been
without
any
consciousness
of
insincerity
or
acting
on
his
part
god
had
chosen
him
and
there
he
was
for
ever
and
ever
safe
and
happy
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
assured
that
when
the
moment
arrived
he
would
have
in
heaven
a
good
time
it
was
that
he
was
greatly
exalted
so
that
he
gave
his
twopence
a
week
to
his
never
pulled
amy
hair
never
teased
his
canary
he
had
been
aware
young
though
he
was
of
another
life
he
prayed
and
prayed
he
went
to
an
endless
succession
of
services
and
meetings
there
was
bates
one
of
the
leading
brethren
then
who
loved
him
and
spoilt
him
above
all
through
and
beyond
it
all
there
was
his
father
who
adored
him
and
whom
he
adored
that
adoration
of
god
of
his
father
of
life
itself
was
it
possible
that
a
small
boy
normal
and
ordinary
enough
in
other
ways
could
feel
so
intensely
such
passions
the
dark
room
was
crowding
him
with
figures
and
scenes
a
whole
world
that
he
had
thought
dead
and
withered
was
beating
urgently
insistently
upon
his
consciousness
in
another
instant
he
did
not
know
what
surrender
what
acknowledgement
he
might
have
made
it
seemed
to
him
that
nothing
in
life
was
worth
while
save
to
receive
again
in
some
fashion
that
vitality
that
he
had
once
known
the
door
was
flung
open
a
stream
of
light
struck
the
dark
the
shadows
memories
fled
like
crackling
smoke
into
the
air
amy
stood
in
the
doorway
blinking
at
him
scowling
he
knew
for
some
undefined
reason
that
he
could
not
meet
his
father
eyes
he
jumped
up
and
walked
to
the
window
chapter
ii
expectation
maggie
developed
marvellously
during
her
first
weeks
in
london
it
could
not
truthfully
be
said
that
her
aunts
gave
her
great
opportunity
for
development
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
she
might
as
well
have
been
back
in
the
green
seclusion
of
dreots
it
is
true
that
she
accompanied
her
aunt
elizabeth
upon
several
shopping
expeditions
and
on
one
hazardous
afternoon
they
penetrated
the
tangled
undergrowth
of
harrods
stores
on
all
these
occasions
maggie
was
too
deeply
occupied
with
the
personal
safety
and
happiness
of
her
aunt
to
have
leisure
for
many
observations
aunt
elizabeth
always
started
upon
her
shopping
expeditions
with
the
conviction
that
something
terrible
was
about
to
happen
and
the
expectation
of
this
overwhelming
catastrophe
paralysed
her
nerves
maggie
wondered
how
it
could
have
been
with
her
when
she
had
ventured
forth
alone
she
would
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
street
hesitating
as
to
the
right
omnibus
for
her
to
take
she
was
often
uncertain
of
the
direction
in
which
she
should
go
she
would
wave
her
umbrella
at
an
omnibus
and
then
when
it
began
to
slacken
in
answer
to
her
appeal
would
discover
that
it
was
not
the
one
that
she
needed
and
would
wave
her
umbrella
furiously
once
more
then
when
at
last
she
had
mounted
the
vehicle
she
would
flood
the
conductor
with
a
stream
of
little
questions
darting
her
eyes
angrily
at
all
her
neighbours
as
though
they
were
gathered
there
together
to
murder
her
at
the
earliest
opportunity
she
would
be
desperately
confused
when
asked
to
pay
for
her
ticket
would
be
unable
to
find
her
purse
and
then
when
she
discovered
it
would
scatter
its
contents
upon
the
ground
in
such
an
agony
would
she
be
at
the
threatened
passing
of
her
destination
that
she
would
spring
up
at
every
pause
of
the
omnibus
striking
her
nearest
neighbour
eye
or
nose
with
her
umbrella
apologising
nervously
and
then
because
she
thought
she
had
been
too
forward
with
a
stranger
staring
fiercely
about
her
and
daring
any
one
to
speak
to
her
upon
the
day
that
she
visited
harrods
she
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
time
in
the
lift
because
she
always
wished
to
be
somewhere
where
she
was
not
and
because
it
always
went
up
when
she
wished
it
to
go
down
and
down
when
she
wished
it
to
go
up
maggie
upon
this
eventful
occasion
did
her
best
but
she
also
was
bewildered
and
wondered
how
any
of
the
attendants
found
their
way
home
at
night
before
the
end
of
the
afternoon
aunt
elizabeth
was
not
far
from
tears
it
is
cutlery
we
want
i
told
the
man
that
it
was
saucepans
they
pay
us
no
attention
at
all
you
are
any
help
to
me
maggie
they
arrived
in
a
room
filled
with
performing
gramophones
this
was
the
final
blow
aunt
elizabeth
trembling
all
over
refused
either
to
advance
or
retreat
will
you
please
said
maggie
very
firmly
to
a
beautifully
clothed
young
man
with
hair
like
a
show
us
the
way
to
the
street
he
very
kindly
showed
them
and
it
was
not
until
they
were
in
the
homeward
omnibus
that
aunt
elizabeth
discovered
that
she
had
bought
nothing
at
all
nevertheless
although
maggie
collected
but
little
interesting
detail
from
these
occasions
she
did
gather
a
fine
general
impression
of
whirling
movement
and
adventure
one
day
she
would
plunge
into
it
meanwhile
it
was
better
that
she
should
move
slowly
and
assemble
gradual
impressions
the
solid
caution
that
was
mingled
in
her
nature
with
passionate
feeling
and
enthusiasm
taught
her
admirable
wisdom
aunt
anne
it
seemed
never
moved
beyond
the
small
radius
of
her
home
and
the
chapel
she
attended
continually
chapel
services
she
had
one
or
two
intimate
friends
a
simple
and
devout
old
maid
called
miss
pyncheon
magnus
whom
maggie
had
seen
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
thurston
to
whom
maggie
had
taken
an
instant
dislike
and
amy
warlock
she
visited
these
people
and
they
visited
her
for
the
rest
she
seemed
to
take
no
exercise
and
her
declared
love
for
the
country
did
not
lead
her
into
the
parks
she
was
more
silent
if
possible
than
she
had
been
at
dreots
and
read
to
herself
a
great
deal
in
the
dark
and
melancholy
although
she
talked
very
little
to
maggie
the
girl
fancied
that
her
eye
was
always
upon
her
there
was
a
strange
attitude
of
watchfulness
in
her
silent
withdrawal
from
her
scene
as
though
she
had
retired
simply
because
she
could
see
the
better
from
a
distance
she
liked
maggie
to
read
the
bible
to
her
and
for
an
hour
of
every
evening
maggie
did
this
for
some
reason
the
girl
greatly
disliked
this
hour
and
dreaded
its
approach
it
was
perhaps
because
it
seemed
to
bring
before
her
the
figure
of
her
father
the
words
as
they
fell
from
her
lips
seemed
to
be
repeated
by
him
as
he
stood
behind
her
nothing
was
more
unexpected
by
her
than
the
way
that
those
last
days
at
dreots
crowded
about
her
they
should
surely
have
been
killed
by
the
colours
and
interests
of
this
new
life
it
appeared
that
they
were
only
accentuated
by
them
especially
did
she
see
that
night
when
she
had
watched
beside
her
father
dead
body
she
saw
the
stirring
of
the
beard
the
shape
of
the
feet
beneath
the
sheet
the
flicker
of
the
candle
apart
from
this
one
hour
of
the
day
however
she
was
happy
excited
expectant
what
it
was
that
she
expected
she
did
not
exactly
know
but
there
were
so
many
things
that
life
might
now
do
for
her
one
thing
that
very
evidently
it
did
not
intend
to
do
for
her
was
to
make
her
tidy
careful
and
a
good
manager
old
martha
the
cardinal
servant
was
her
sworn
enemy
and
indeed
with
reason
it
seemed
that
maggie
could
not
remember
the
things
that
she
was
told
lighted
lamps
were
left
long
after
they
should
have
been
extinguished
one
night
the
bathroom
was
drowned
in
water
by
a
running
tap
her
clothes
were
not
mended
she
was
never
punctual
at
and
yet
no
one
could
call
her
a
dreamy
child
she
could
about
things
that
interested
her
be
remarkably
sharp
and
penetrating
she
had
a
swift
and
often
successful
intuition
about
characters
facts
and
details
about
places
or
people
she
never
forgot
she
had
a
hard
severe
entirely
masculine
sense
of
independence
an
ironic
contempt
for
sentimentality
a
warm
ardent
loyalty
and
simplicity
in
friendship
her
carelessness
in
all
the
details
of
life
sprang
from
her
long
muddled
years
at
dreots
the
lack
of
a
mother
guidance
and
education
the
careless
selfishness
of
her
father
disregard
of
her
she
struggled
poor
child
passionately
to
improve
herself
she
sat
for
hours
in
her
room
working
at
her
clothes
trying
to
mend
her
stockings
the
holes
in
her
blouses
the
rip
of
the
braid
at
the
bottom
of
her
skirt
she
waited
listening
for
the
cuckoo
to
call
that
she
might
be
in
exact
time
for
luncheon
or
dinner
and
then
as
she
listened
some
thought
would
occur
to
her
and
although
she
did
not
dream
her
definite
tracking
of
her
idea
would
lead
her
to
forget
all
time
soon
there
would
be
martha
knock
on
the
door
and
her
surly
voice
quarter
of
an
hour
they
been
sitting
at
luncheon
miss
and
her
clothes
the
aunts
had
said
that
she
must
buy
what
was
necessary
and
she
had
gone
with
aunt
elizabeth
to
choose
all
the
right
things
they
had
between
them
bought
all
the
wrong
ones
maggie
had
no
idea
of
whether
or
no
something
suited
her
a
dress
a
hat
that
would
look
charming
upon
any
one
else
looked
terrible
upon
her
she
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
but
nothing
became
her
her
new
friend
caroline
smith
laughing
and
chattering
tried
to
help
her
caroline
had
very
definite
ideas
about
dress
and
indeed
spent
the
majority
of
her
waking
hours
in
contemplation
of
that
subject
but
she
had
never
she
declared
been
in
all
her
life
so
puzzled
she
was
perfectly
frank
but
it
looks
awful
maggie
dear
and
yesterday
in
the
shop
it
seem
so
bad
although
that
old
pig
would
let
us
have
it
the
way
we
wanted
it
just
as
it
is
with
poor
mother
who
gets
fatter
and
fatter
diet
herself
as
she
may
so
that
she
can
wear
nothing
at
all
now
that
looks
right
and
is
only
really
comfortable
in
her
of
course
you
not
fat
maggie
darling
but
it
your
figure
everything
either
too
long
or
too
short
for
you
you
mind
my
speaking
so
frankly
do
you
i
always
say
one
either
a
friend
or
not
and
if
one
a
friend
why
then
be
as
rude
as
you
please
friendship
for
they
were
in
fact
the
greatest
possible
friends
maggie
had
never
possessed
a
before
she
had
in
the
first
days
of
the
acquaintance
been
shy
and
very
silent
she
had
been
afraid
of
going
too
far
but
soon
she
had
seen
that
she
could
not
go
too
far
and
could
not
say
too
much
she
had
discovered
then
a
multitude
of
new
happinesses
there
was
nothing
she
found
too
small
too
unimportant
to
claim
caroline
interest
caroline
wished
to
know
everything
and
soon
maggie
disclosed
to
her
many
things
that
she
had
told
to
no
other
human
being
in
her
life
before
it
could
not
honestly
be
said
that
caroline
had
many
wise
comments
to
make
on
maggie
experiences
her
attitude
was
one
of
surprised
excitement
she
was
amazed
by
the
most
ordinary
incidents
and
conversations
she
found
maggie
life
quite
incredible
you
must
stop
me
maggie
if
i
hurt
your
feelings
but
really
why
if
poor
father
had
treated
me
like
that
i
have
gone
straight
out
of
the
house
and
never
come
back
i
would
indeed
well
here
you
are
now
dear
and
we
must
just
see
each
other
as
often
as
ever
we
can
they
made
a
strange
contrast
maggie
so
plain
in
her
black
dress
with
her
hair
that
always
looked
as
though
it
had
been
cut
short
like
a
boy
her
strong
rough
movements
and
caroline
so
neat
and
shining
and
entirely
feminine
that
her
only
business
in
the
world
seemed
to
be
to
fascinate
beguile
and
bewilder
the
opposite
sex
whatever
the
aunts
may
have
thought
of
this
new
friendship
they
said
nothing
caroline
had
her
way
with
them
as
with
every
one
else
maggie
wondered
often
as
to
aunt
anne
real
thoughts
but
aunt
anne
only
smiled
her
dim
cold
smile
gave
her
cold
hand
into
the
girl
warm
one
and
said
good
afternoon
caroline
i
hope
your
father
and
mother
are
well
dears
you
know
caroline
said
to
maggie
i
do
admire
your
aunt
anne
she
keeps
to
herself
so
i
wish
i
could
keep
to
myself
but
i
never
was
able
to
poor
mother
used
to
say
when
i
was
quite
little
only
make
yourself
cheap
carrie
if
you
go
on
like
that
do
make
yourself
cheap
dear
but
what
i
say
is
one
only
young
once
and
the
people
who
do
want
one
need
have
one
nevertheless
there
were
even
in
these
very
early
days
directions
into
which
maggie
did
not
follow
her
new
friend
young
as
she
was
in
many
things
in
some
ways
she
was
very
old
indeed
she
had
been
trained
in
another
school
from
caroline
she
felt
from
the
very
first
that
upon
certain
questions
her
lovely
friend
was
inexperienced
foolish
and
dangerously
reckless
on
the
question
of
men
for
instance
maggie
with
clear
knowledge
of
her
father
and
her
uncle
refused
to
follow
caroline
light
and
easy
excursions
caroline
was
disappointed
she
had
a
great
deal
to
say
on
the
subject
and
could
speak
she
assured
maggie
from
a
vast
variety
of
experience
men
are
all
the
same
what
i
say
is
show
them
you
do
care
about
them
and
they
come
after
you
not
that
i
care
whether
they
do
or
no
only
it
fun
the
way
they
go
on
you
just
try
maggie
but
maggie
had
her
own
thoughts
they
were
not
imparted
to
her
friend
nothing
indeed
appeared
to
her
more
odd
than
that
caroline
should
be
so
wise
in
some
things
and
so
foolish
in
others
she
did
not
know
that
it
was
her
own
strange
upbringing
that
gave
her
independent
estimates
and
judgments
the
second
influence
that
during
these
first
weeks
developed
her
soul
and
body
was
strangely
enough
her
aunt
elderly
friend
magnus
if
caroline
introduced
her
to
affairs
of
the
world
magnus
introduced
her
to
affairs
of
the
brain
and
spirit
she
had
never
before
known
any
one
who
might
be
called
clever
her
father
was
not
uncle
mathew
was
not
no
one
in
dreots
had
been
clever
magnus
of
course
was
clever
because
he
wrote
books
two
a
year
but
to
be
an
author
was
not
a
claim
to
maggie
admiration
as
has
been
said
before
she
did
not
care
for
reading
and
considered
that
the
writing
of
books
was
a
affair
the
things
that
magnus
might
have
done
with
his
life
if
he
had
not
spent
it
in
writing
books
she
regarded
him
with
the
kind
indulgence
of
an
elder
who
watches
a
child
he
very
quickly
discovered
her
attitude
and
it
amused
him
they
became
the
most
excellent
friends
over
it
she
on
her
side
very
quickly
discovered
the
true
reason
of
his
coming
so
often
to
their
house
he
loved
aunt
anne
at
its
first
appearance
this
discovery
was
so
strange
and
odd
that
maggie
refused
to
indulge
it
love
seemed
so
far
from
aunt
anne
she
greeted
magnus
from
the
chill
distance
whence
she
greeted
the
rest
of
the
world
she
gave
him
no
more
than
she
gave
any
one
else
but
magnus
did
not
seem
to
desire
more
he
waited
patiently
a
slightly
ironical
and
worshipper
at
a
shrine
that
very
seldom
opened
its
doors
and
never
admitted
him
to
its
altar
it
was
this
irony
that
maggie
liked
in
him
she
regarded
herself
in
the
same
way
their
friendship
was
founded
on
a
mutual
detachment
it
prospered
exceedingly
maggie
soon
discovered
that
magnus
was
very
happy
to
sit
in
their
house
even
though
aunt
anne
was
not
present
his
attitude
seemed
to
be
that
the
atmosphere
that
she
left
behind
her
was
enough
for
him
and
that
he
could
not
in
justice
expect
any
more
before
maggie
arrival
he
had
had
but
a
slender
excuse
for
his
continual
presence
he
could
not
sit
in
the
empty
surveying
the
large
and
ominous
portrait
of
the
cardinal
childhood
quite
alone
save
for
thomas
without
seeming
a
very
considerable
kind
of
fool
and
to
appear
that
in
the
eyes
of
aunt
anne
who
already
regarded
mankind
in
general
with
pity
would
be
a
mistake
now
that
maggie
was
here
he
might
come
so
often
as
he
pleased
many
was
the
dark
afternoon
through
the
long
february
and
march
months
that
they
sat
together
in
the
dim
maggie
straining
her
eyes
over
an
attempted
reform
of
some
garment
magnus
talking
in
his
mild
ironical
voice
with
his
large
spectacles
fixed
upon
nothing
in
particular
magnus
did
all
the
talking
maggie
fancied
that
all
his
life
he
had
persisted
in
the
same
gentle
humorous
fashion
without
any
especial
attention
as
to
the
wisdom
agreement
or
even
existence
of
his
audience
she
fancied
that
all
men
who
wrote
books
did
that
they
had
to
talk
to
clear
their
ideas
she
raised
her
eyes
sometimes
and
looked
at
him
as
he
sat
there
his
shabby
hapless
appearance
always
appealed
to
her
she
knew
that
he
was
in
reality
anything
but
hapless
but
his
clothes
never
fitted
him
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
escape
from
the
quixotic
embarrassments
of
his
thin
hair
his
high
his
large
spectacles
his
smile
however
gave
him
his
character
when
he
smiled
and
he
was
always
smiling
you
saw
a
man
independent
proud
wise
and
gentle
he
was
not
a
fool
magnus
although
he
did
love
aunt
anne
to
a
great
deal
that
he
said
maggie
paid
but
little
attention
it
was
she
felt
not
intended
for
her
she
had
in
all
her
relations
with
him
to
struggle
against
the
initial
disadvantage
that
she
regarded
all
men
who
wrote
books
with
pity
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
not
to
realise
that
there
were
a
great
many
fine
books
in
the
world
and
that
one
was
the
better
for
reading
them
but
just
because
there
were
already
so
many
fine
ones
why
write
more
that
would
almost
certainly
be
not
so
fine
he
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
some
men
were
compelled
to
write
and
could
not
help
themselves
i
wrote
my
first
book
when
i
was
nineteen
one
morning
i
just
began
to
write
and
then
it
was
very
easy
then
everything
else
was
easy
the
first
publisher
to
whom
i
sent
it
accepted
it
it
was
published
and
had
quite
a
success
i
thought
i
was
made
for
life
anything
seemed
possible
to
one
after
all
so
far
as
one
possibilities
went
one
was
on
a
level
with
any
one
shakespeare
dante
any
one
you
like
one
might
do
anything
i
published
a
book
a
year
after
that
for
ten
years
ten
years
ten
books
and
then
awoke
to
the
fact
that
i
was
nothing
at
all
and
would
never
be
anything
that
i
would
never
write
like
shakespeare
and
a
matter
of
equal
importance
would
never
sell
like
henry
wood
not
that
i
wished
to
write
like
any
one
else
i
had
a
great
idea
of
keeping
to
my
own
individuality
but
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
what
i
had
in
myself
all
of
it
was
no
real
importance
to
any
one
i
might
so
well
have
been
a
butcher
or
baker
for
all
that
it
mattered
i
saw
that
i
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
people
there
are
many
of
them
just
in
between
the
artists
and
the
shopkeepers
i
was
an
artist
all
right
but
not
a
good
enough
one
to
count
had
i
been
a
shopkeeper
i
might
have
sold
my
goods
well
then
here
your
question
miss
cardinal
why
on
earth
did
i
go
on
writing
simply
because
i
could
help
myself
writing
was
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
gave
me
happiness
i
thought
too
that
there
might
be
people
here
and
there
unknown
to
me
who
cared
for
what
i
did
not
many
of
course
i
soon
discovered
that
outside
the
small
library
set
in
london
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
me
when
i
was
younger
i
had
fancied
that
that
to
me
fiery
blazing
advertisement
new
novel
by
william
magnus
author
of
must
cause
men
to
stop
in
the
street
exclaim
rush
home
to
tell
their
wives
you
know
magnus
new
novel
is
out
now
i
realised
that
by
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
and
five
out
of
every
ten
women
the
literary
page
in
the
paper
is
turned
over
with
exactly
the
same
impatience
with
which
i
turn
over
the
betting
columns
anyway
why
not
perfectly
right
and
then
by
this
time
i
seen
my
old
books
often
enough
lying
scattered
amongst
dusty
piles
in
shops
marked
this
lot
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
novels
dirty
degraded
ashamed
i
ask
sometimes
when
i
was
very
young
for
my
own
works
the
name
what
magnus
no
do
stock
him
no
demand
we
could
get
you
a
copy
sir
there
it
is
why
not
laugh
at
it
i
was
doing
perhaps
the
most
useless
thing
in
the
world
a
commonplace
little
hung
on
a
wall
can
give
happiness
to
heaps
of
people
a
poor
piece
of
music
can
do
a
thousand
things
good
and
bad
but
an
unsuccessful
novel
twenty
unsuccessful
novels
a
whole
row
with
the
same
history
awaiting
their
successors
welcome
a
new
novel
by
william
magnus
who
our
readers
will
remember
wrote
that
clever
story
the
present
work
seems
to
us
at
least
the
equal
of
any
that
have
preceded
it
a
fortnight
advertisement
dead
silence
some
one
in
the
club
see
you
written
another
book
old
man
you
do
turn
out
a
letter
from
a
press
agency
who
has
never
heard
of
one
name
before
little
sheaf
of
thin
miserable
cuttings
the
sixpenny
lot
ouf
and
still
i
go
on
and
shall
go
on
until
i
die
perhaps
after
all
i
more
justified
than
any
of
them
i
stripped
of
all
reasons
save
the
pleasure
the
thrill
the
torment
the
hopes
the
despairs
of
the
work
itself
i
got
nothing
else
out
of
it
and
shall
get
nothing
and
therefore
i
justified
now
do
you
understand
a
little
miss
cardinal
she
half
understood
she
understood
that
he
was
compelled
to
do
it
just
as
some
men
are
compelled
to
go
to
race
meetings
and
just
as
uncle
mathew
was
compelled
to
drink
but
she
nevertheless
thought
it
a
dreadful
pity
that
he
was
unable
to
stop
and
interest
himself
in
something
else
then
he
could
see
it
so
plainly
and
yet
go
on
she
admired
and
at
the
same
time
pitied
him
it
seemed
this
private
history
of
magnus
at
first
sight
so
far
from
maggie
immediate
concerns
her
new
life
her
aunts
the
chapel
and
the
chapel
world
it
was
only
afterwards
when
she
looked
back
that
she
was
able
to
see
that
all
these
private
affairs
of
private
people
radiated
inwards
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
towards
the
mysterious
inner
circle
that
inner
circle
of
which
she
was
already
dimly
aware
and
of
which
she
was
soon
to
feel
the
heat
and
light
she
was
meanwhile
so
far
impressed
by
magnus
confidences
that
she
borrowed
one
of
his
novels
from
caroline
who
confided
to
her
that
she
herself
thought
it
the
dullest
and
most
tiresome
of
works
to
be
honest
i
only
read
a
bit
of
it
i
do
know
what
it
about
i
think
it
downright
silly
this
book
bore
the
mysterious
title
of
dredinger
it
was
concerned
apparently
with
the
experiences
of
a
young
man
who
buying
an
empty
house
in
bloomsbury
discovered
a
pool
of
water
in
the
cellar
the
young
man
was
called
dredinger
which
seemed
to
maggie
an
unnatural
kind
of
name
he
had
an
irritating
habit
of
never
finishing
his
sentences
and
the
people
he
knew
answered
him
in
the
same
inconclusive
fashion
the
pool
in
the
cellar
naturally
annoyed
him
but
he
did
nothing
very
practical
about
it
allowed
it
to
remain
there
and
discussed
it
with
a
professor
of
chemistry
beyond
this
maggie
could
not
penetrate
the
young
man
was
apparently
in
love
with
a
lady
much
older
than
himself
who
wore
but
it
was
an
arid
kind
of
love
in
which
the
young
man
discovered
motives
and
symptoms
with
the
same
dexterous
surprise
with
which
he
discovered
newts
and
tadpoles
in
the
maggie
bravely
attacked
magnus
why
did
he
have
men
in
to
clear
up
the
pond
and
lay
a
new
floor
she
asked
that
was
just
the
point
said
magnus
he
could
why
could
he
weakness
of
character
and
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
he
talked
too
much
she
answered
decisively
but
are
there
houses
in
london
with
ponds
in
them
lots
said
magnus
only
the
owners
of
the
houses
do
know
it
there
is
a
big
pond
in
the
chapel
that
what
thurston
came
out
of
this
was
beyond
maggie
altogether
an
agreeable
thing
however
about
magnus
was
that
he
did
not
mind
when
you
disliked
his
work
he
seemed
to
expect
that
you
would
not
like
it
he
was
certainly
a
very
unconceited
man
a
more
important
and
more
interesting
theme
was
magnus
reason
for
being
where
he
was
what
was
he
doing
here
what
led
him
to
the
chapel
doors
he
being
in
no
way
a
religious
man
it
was
like
this
he
told
her
i
was
living
in
golders
green
and
suddenly
one
morning
i
was
tired
of
the
country
that
was
country
and
the
butcher
boy
and
the
postman
so
i
moved
as
far
into
the
centre
of
things
as
i
could
and
took
a
room
in
martin
lane
close
at
hand
here
then
one
evening
i
was
wandering
about
a
desolate
sunday
evening
when
the
town
is
given
over
to
cats
i
suddenly
came
across
the
chapel
i
like
going
into
london
churches
by
chance
there
always
something
interesting
something
you
would
expect
the
chapel
simply
astonished
me
i
could
imagine
what
they
were
all
about
it
the
ordinary
london
congregation
it
was
almost
the
ordinary
london
service
and
yet
not
quite
there
was
an
air
of
expectation
and
even
excitement
which
is
most
unusual
in
a
london
church
then
there
was
warlock
of
course
one
could
see
at
once
that
he
was
an
extraordinary
man
a
kind
of
prophet
all
on
his
own
he
was
as
far
away
from
that
congregation
as
columbus
was
from
his
crew
when
he
first
sighted
the
indies
i
met
one
or
two
prophets
in
my
time
and
their
concern
has
always
been
with
their
audience
first
themselves
second
and
their
vision
last
warlock
is
the
other
way
round
he
should
have
been
a
hermit
not
the
leader
of
a
community
well
it
interested
me
i
came
again
and
again
i
going
to
stay
on
now
until
the
end
the
end
asked
maggie
the
end
of
myself
or
the
chapel
whichever
comes
first
i
wrote
a
story
once
a
very
bad
one
about
some
merchants
why
merchants
i
know
who
were
flung
on
a
desert
island
it
was
all
jungle
and
desolation
and
then
suddenly
they
came
upon
a
little
white
temple
it
does
matter
what
happened
afterwards
i
myself
forgotten
most
of
it
but
i
remember
that
the
sailors
used
the
temple
in
different
ways
to
keep
their
hopes
and
expectations
alive
their
expectations
that
one
day
a
ship
would
come
and
save
them
and
so
far
as
i
remember
they
became
imaginative
about
the
temple
and
fancied
that
the
unknown
god
of
it
would
help
them
to
regain
their
private
affairs
one
of
them
wanted
to
get
back
to
his
girl
another
to
his
favourite
pub
another
to
his
another
to
his
collection
of
miniatures
and
they
used
to
sit
and
look
at
the
temple
day
after
day
and
expect
something
to
happen
when
the
ship
came
at
last
they
would
go
into
it
because
they
could
bear
to
think
that
something
should
happen
at
last
and
they
not
be
there
to
see
it
oh
yes
one
of
them
went
back
i
remember
but
his
actual
meeting
with
his
girl
was
so
disappointing
in
comparison
with
his
long
expectation
of
it
in
front
of
the
temple
that
he
took
the
next
boat
back
to
the
island
but
he
never
found
it
again
he
travelled
everywhere
and
died
a
disappointed
man
at
sea
magnus
was
fond
of
telling
little
stories
obscure
and
pointless
and
maggie
supposed
that
it
was
a
literary
habit
on
this
occasion
he
continued
to
talk
quite
naturally
for
his
own
satisfaction
yes
one
can
make
oneself
believe
in
anything
i
have
believed
in
all
sorts
of
things
in
england
of
course
people
have
believed
in
nothing
except
that
things
will
always
be
as
they
always
have
been
a
useful
belief
considering
that
things
have
never
been
as
they
always
were
in
the
old
days
when
the
boer
war
had
interfered
with
tradition
it
must
have
seemed
to
any
one
who
was
a
young
man
pretty
hopeless
but
now
i
do
know
imagination
breaking
in
warlock
a
prophet
i
got
fascinated
sitting
round
this
chapel
as
badly
as
any
of
them
yes
one
can
be
led
into
belief
of
anything
and
what
do
you
believe
in
mr
magnus
asked
maggie
well
not
in
myself
anyway
nor
thurston
nor
miss
avies
but
in
your
aunt
perhaps
and
warlock
the
only
thing
i
sure
of
is
that
there
something
there
but
what
it
is
of
course
i
ca
tell
you
and
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
know
the
story
of
sir
galahad
miss
cardinal
it
seems
to
us
now
but
it
a
fine
story
and
true
enough
maggie
who
knew
nothing
of
was
silent
he
ended
with
mind
you
decide
for
yourself
that
the
great
thing
in
life
do
you
believe
anything
that
any
one
tells
you
see
for
yourself
and
if
there
something
of
great
value
do
think
the
less
of
it
because
the
people
who
admire
it
are
worth
very
much
why
should
they
be
and
possibly
after
all
it
only
themselves
admiring
there
a
fearful
lot
of
nonsense
and
humbug
in
this
thing
but
there
something
real
too
he
changed
his
note
suddenly
addressing
himself
intently
to
her
as
though
he
had
a
message
to
deliver
do
think
me
impertinent
but
your
aunt
anne
see
as
much
of
her
as
you
can
she
devoted
to
you
miss
cardinal
you
may
have
seen
it
she
a
reserved
woman
and
very
shy
of
her
feelings
but
spoken
to
me
i
hope
i
not
interfering
to
say
this
but
perhaps
at
first
you
do
understand
her
she
loves
you
you
the
first
human
being
i
do
believe
that
she
ever
loved
what
was
there
then
in
maggie
that
started
up
in
rebellion
at
this
unexpected
declaration
she
had
been
sitting
there
tranquil
soothed
with
a
happy
sense
that
her
new
life
was
developing
securely
for
her
in
the
way
that
she
would
have
it
suddenly
she
was
alert
suspicious
hostile
what
has
she
said
to
you
she
asked
quickly
frowning
up
at
him
and
drawing
back
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
him
he
was
startled
at
the
change
in
her
said
he
repeated
stammering
a
little
why
only
nothing
except
that
she
cared
for
you
and
hoped
that
you
would
be
happy
she
was
afraid
that
it
would
all
be
strange
for
you
at
first
perhaps
i
have
been
interfering
no
maggie
interrupted
quickly
not
you
only
i
must
lead
my
own
life
i
must
must
i
i
do
want
to
be
selfish
but
i
can
begin
for
myself
now
i
have
a
little
money
of
my
own
and
i
must
make
my
own
way
i
do
want
to
be
selfish
she
repeated
but
i
must
be
free
i
do
understand
aunt
anne
she
never
seems
to
care
for
me
i
want
to
do
everything
for
her
i
can
but
i
do
want
to
be
under
any
one
ever
any
more
she
was
so
young
when
she
said
this
that
he
was
suddenly
moved
to
an
affectionate
fatherly
tenderness
but
he
knew
her
now
too
well
to
show
it
no
you
must
be
selfish
he
answered
her
almost
drily
we
lead
our
lives
quite
alone
you
know
every
step
we
take
we
affect
some
one
somewhere
your
aunt
does
want
your
liberty
she
wants
your
affection
she
wants
to
make
me
religious
maggie
brought
out
staring
at
magnus
ah
if
you
see
that
you
do
understand
her
he
answered
how
should
you
yet
she
cares
so
deeply
for
her
religion
that
she
wishes
naturally
any
one
whom
she
loves
to
share
it
with
her
but
if
you
do
if
you
do
cried
maggie
springing
up
from
her
seat
and
facing
him
i
sure
she
would
wish
to
influence
no
one
he
continued
gravely
you
seen
for
yourself
how
apart
her
life
is
she
is
too
conscious
of
the
necessity
for
her
own
liberty
it
is
liberty
it
slavery
maggie
caught
him
up
passionately
do
you
suppose
i
have
watched
all
these
weeks
what
does
her
religion
do
but
shut
her
off
from
everything
and
everybody
is
she
kind
to
aunt
elizabeth
no
she
is
and
you
know
it
would
she
care
if
we
were
all
of
us
buried
in
the
ruins
of
this
house
not
for
a
single
moment
and
it
her
religion
i
hate
religion
i
hate
it
and
since
i
been
in
this
house
i
hated
it
more
and
more
you
do
know
what
it
was
like
with
father
i
do
think
of
it
now
or
talk
of
it
but
i
know
what
it
made
of
him
and
now
it
the
same
here
only
it
takes
them
in
a
different
way
but
it
the
same
in
the
end
no
one
who
religious
cares
for
any
one
and
they
make
the
same
of
me
aunt
anne
would
the
same
as
she
made
of
aunt
elizabeth
they
said
much
yet
but
they
waiting
for
the
right
moment
and
then
they
spring
it
upon
me
it
in
the
house
it
in
the
rooms
in
the
very
furniture
it
as
though
father
had
come
back
and
was
driving
me
into
it
and
i
want
to
be
free
i
want
to
lead
my
own
life
to
make
it
myself
i
do
want
to
think
about
god
or
heaven
or
hell
i
do
care
whether
i
good
or
bad
what
the
use
of
my
being
here
in
london
and
never
seeing
anything
i
go
into
a
shop
or
something
and
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
they
sha
catch
me
they
sha
if
uncle
mathew
were
here
she
broke
off
suddenly
breathless
staring
at
magnus
as
though
she
had
not
been
aware
until
now
that
he
was
in
the
room
to
say
that
her
outburst
astonished
him
was
to
put
it
very
mildly
indeed
she
had
always
been
so
quiet
and
restrained
she
had
seemed
so
happy
and
tranquil
he
blushed
pushed
his
spectacles
with
his
fingers
then
finally
stammered
i
no
idea
that
that
you
hated
it
so
much
she
was
quiet
and
composed
again
i
do
hate
it
she
answered
very
calmly
only
they
sha
tie
me
no
one
shall
and
in
the
house
as
though
some
one
were
watching
behind
every
door
it
used
to
be
just
the
same
at
home
when
people
think
a
lot
about
religion
something
seems
to
get
into
a
place
why
truly
magnus
i
wondered
once
or
twice
lately
in
spite
of
myself
whether
they
may
be
right
after
all
and
god
going
to
come
in
a
chariot
and
set
the
world
on
fire
it
sounds
silly
but
when
you
see
the
way
aunt
anne
and
warlock
believe
things
it
almost
makes
them
true
maggie
finally
added
you
must
think
me
selfish
i
very
very
grateful
for
all
their
kindness
i
very
happy
it
all
splendid
compared
with
what
life
used
to
be
at
home
but
i
fancy
sometimes
that
the
aunts
think
i
just
going
to
settle
down
here
for
ever
and
be
like
them
and
i
not
i
afraid
of
aunt
anne
afraid
of
her
said
magnus
ah
you
must
be
that
she
has
some
plan
in
her
head
i
know
she
has
no
plan
is
set
except
for
your
good
said
magnus
i
do
want
any
one
to
bother
about
my
good
answered
maggie
i
can
look
after
that
for
myself
this
little
conversation
revealed
maggie
to
magnus
in
an
entirely
new
light
he
had
thought
her
until
now
a
good
simple
girl
entirely
ignorant
of
life
and
eager
to
be
taught
the
sudden
discovery
of
her
independence
distressed
him
he
left
the
house
that
afternoon
with
many
new
points
to
consider
meanwhile
maggie
had
kept
from
him
the
true
root
of
the
matter
she
had
said
nothing
of
martin
warlock
she
had
said
nothing
even
to
herself
about
him
and
yet
the
consciousness
of
her
meeting
with
him
was
always
with
her
as
a
fire
smoulders
in
the
hold
of
a
ship
burning
stealthily
through
the
thick
heart
of
the
place
dim
and
concealed
to
burst
suddenly
with
a
touch
of
the
wind
into
shining
flame
it
was
after
her
talk
to
magnus
that
she
suddenly
saw
that
martin
warlock
was
always
in
her
thoughts
and
then
because
she
was
maggie
and
had
never
been
deceitful
to
herself
or
to
any
one
else
she
faced
the
fact
and
considered
it
she
knew
that
she
was
ignorant
of
the
world
and
of
life
that
she
knew
nothing
about
men
and
although
she
had
many
times
fancied
to
herself
what
love
must
be
like
she
did
not
tell
herself
now
that
it
was
love
that
had
come
to
her
she
saw
him
as
a
desirable
companion
she
thought
that
he
would
make
a
most
interesting
friend
she
would
like
to
make
her
experiences
of
life
with
him
at
her
side
she
would
be
free
and
he
would
be
free
but
they
would
exchange
confidences
and
then
because
she
was
very
simple
and
had
learnt
nothing
of
the
difference
between
the
things
that
decent
girls
might
do
and
the
things
they
might
not
she
began
to
consider
the
easiest
way
of
meeting
him
she
intended
to
go
to
him
simply
as
one
human
being
to
another
and
tell
him
that
she
liked
him
and
hoped
that
they
would
often
see
one
another
there
were
no
confused
issues
nor
questions
of
propriety
before
maggie
certainly
she
was
aware
that
men
took
advantage
of
girls
weakness
but
that
was
as
in
the
case
of
uncle
mathew
when
they
had
drunk
too
much
and
it
was
the
fault
of
the
girls
too
for
not
looking
after
themselves
maggie
felt
that
she
could
look
after
herself
anywhere
she
was
more
afraid
by
far
of
her
aunt
anne
than
of
any
man
it
happened
on
the
very
day
after
that
conversation
with
magnus
that
aunt
anne
said
at
luncheon
i
think
maggie
dear
if
you
do
mind
that
you
and
i
will
pay
a
call
on
warlock
this
afternoon
you
have
not
been
there
yet
will
be
a
very
good
opportunity
maggie
mind
flew
at
once
to
her
clothes
she
had
been
with
caroline
smith
to
that
young
lady
dressmaker
a
thin
and
woman
whose
black
dress
gleamed
with
innumerable
pins
maggie
had
been
pinched
and
measured
pulled
in
here
and
pulled
out
there
then
there
had
been
afternoons
when
she
had
been
fitted
under
humorous
and
critical
eye
finally
the
dress
had
been
delivered
only
two
days
ago
in
a
long
box
it
waited
now
for
the
great
occasion
the
great
occasion
had
in
the
guise
of
the
warlock
family
surely
arrived
maggie
heart
beat
as
she
went
up
to
her
room
when
at
last
she
was
wearing
the
dress
standing
before
her
mirror
her
cheeks
were
red
and
her
hands
shook
a
little
the
dress
was
very
fine
simple
of
course
and
quite
plain
but
elegant
as
no
dress
of
maggie
had
ever
been
elegant
there
surely
could
not
anywhere
be
a
more
perfect
black
dress
and
yet
as
maggie
gazed
she
was
aware
that
there
was
something
not
quite
right
she
was
always
straightforward
with
herself
yes
the
thing
that
was
not
quite
right
was
her
own
stupid
shape
her
figure
was
too
square
her
back
was
too
short
her
hands
too
large
she
had
a
moment
of
acute
disgust
with
herself
so
that
she
could
have
torn
the
dress
from
her
and
rushed
into
her
old
obscure
and
dingy
black
again
of
what
use
to
dress
her
up
she
would
always
look
wrong
always
be
awkward
and
ungainly
tears
of
disappointment
gathered
slowly
in
her
eyes
then
her
pride
reasserted
itself
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
laughed
at
her
anxious
gaze
there
was
still
her
new
hat
she
took
it
from
the
bed
and
put
it
on
sticking
big
pins
into
it
moving
back
from
the
mirror
then
forward
again
turning
her
back
standing
on
her
toes
suddenly
bowing
to
herself
and
waving
her
hand
she
was
caught
thus
laughing
into
the
mirror
by
old
martha
who
pushed
her
sour
face
through
the
door
and
said
they
been
waiting
this
long
time
for
you
miss
all
right
martha
maggie
answered
sharply
annoyed
that
she
should
be
found
posturing
and
bowing
by
the
woman
why
did
you
knock
i
did
knock
miss
you
were
that
occupied
you
did
hear
me
the
old
woman
was
grinning
maggie
went
downstairs
her
heart
still
beating
her
cheeks
still
flushed
she
did
hope
that
aunt
anne
would
be
pleased
aunt
anne
although
she
never
said
anything
about
clothes
must
of
course
notice
such
things
and
if
she
loved
maggie
as
magnus
said
she
did
then
she
would
show
her
approval
the
girl
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
staircase
looking
at
her
aunt
who
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
little
dark
hall
well
dear
i
waiting
she
said
the
burning
eyes
of
thomas
the
cat
watched
from
the
deep
shadows
i
so
sorry
i
was
dressing
said
maggie
her
aunt
said
nothing
more
and
they
left
the
house
maggie
as
always
when
she
walked
with
aunt
anne
was
aware
that
they
made
a
strange
couple
she
so
short
and
the
other
so
tall
she
with
her
sturdy
masculine
walk
her
aunt
with
her
awkward
halting
movement
they
went
in
silence
maggie
longed
for
a
word
of
approval
a
short
sentence
such
as
how
nice
you
looking
maggie
or
i
like
your
dress
maggie
or
that
a
new
dress
dear
i
like
it
would
be
enough
after
that
maggie
felt
that
she
could
face
a
multitude
of
wild
and
savage
warlocks
that
she
could
walk
into
the
warlock
with
a
fine
brave
carriage
above
all
that
she
would
feel
a
sudden
warm
affection
for
her
aunt
that
would
make
all
their
future
life
together
easy
but
aunt
anne
said
nothing
she
looked
exactly
as
she
had
looked
upon
her
first
appearance
at
dreots
so
thin
and
tall
with
her
pale
tapering
face
and
her
eyes
staring
before
her
as
though
they
saw
nothing
maggie
as
they
turned
up
into
garrick
street
said
i
hope
you
like
my
new
dress
aunt
aunt
anne
turned
to
her
for
a
moment
smiled
gently
and
then
vaguely
as
though
her
mind
were
elsewhere
answered
i
liked
your
old
dress
better
dear
maggie
face
flamed
her
temper
flared
into
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
had
wild
thoughts
of
breaking
into
open
rebellion
she
hated
her
dress
she
hated
london
above
all
she
hated
aunt
anne
that
lady
happy
unconsciousness
that
anything
had
occurred
drove
the
girl
into
furious
irritation
well
it
was
hopeless
then
magnus
could
say
what
he
pleased
her
aunt
did
not
care
for
her
she
would
not
mind
did
she
fall
dead
in
the
street
before
her
the
words
in
maggie
mind
were
you
do
look
at
me
i
not
a
human
being
to
you
at
all
but
i
wo
live
with
you
i
go
my
own
way
you
ca
keep
me
if
you
never
speak
to
me
nor
think
of
me
but
in
some
dark
fashion
that
strange
impassivity
held
her
aunt
anne
had
her
power
they
climbed
the
dim
crooked
staircase
behind
the
antiquary
wall
they
rang
the
warlock
bell
and
were
admitted
maggie
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
she
had
expected
but
it
was
certainly
not
the
pink
warm
room
of
warlock
the
heavy
softly
closing
door
hemmed
them
in
the
silent
carpet
folded
about
their
steps
the
canary
twittered
the
fire
spurted
and
crackled
but
at
once
the
girl
heart
went
out
to
old
warlock
she
looked
so
charming
in
her
white
cap
and
blue
bow
her
eyes
were
raised
so
gently
to
maggie
face
and
her
little
hand
was
so
soft
and
warm
the
meeting
between
anne
cardinal
and
warlock
was
very
gracious
aunt
anne
gravely
pressed
the
old
lady
hand
looked
at
her
with
her
grave
distant
eyes
then
very
carefully
and
delicately
sat
down
amy
warlock
came
in
maggie
had
met
her
before
and
disliked
her
conversation
dealt
decently
and
carefully
with
the
weather
the
canary
and
maggie
discovery
of
london
maggie
was
compelled
to
confess
that
she
was
afraid
that
she
had
not
discovered
london
at
all
she
felt
amy
warlock
sharp
eyes
upon
them
all
and
as
always
when
she
was
in
company
that
was
she
thought
suspicious
of
her
she
became
hot
and
uncomfortable
she
frowned
and
spoke
in
short
almost
hostile
sentences
they
laughing
at
my
new
clothes
she
thought
i
wish
i
worn
my
old
ones
and
anyway
these
hurt
me
she
sat
up
very
stiffly
her
hands
on
her
lap
her
eyes
staring
at
the
little
bright
on
the
wall
opposite
warlock
like
a
trickling
dancing
brook
continued
her
talk
of
course
there
the
country
i
was
brought
up
as
a
girl
just
outside
salisbury
so
many
many
years
ago
i
always
tell
my
boy
that
such
an
old
woman
now
that
i
do
belong
to
his
world
at
all
just
to
sit
here
and
see
the
younger
generation
go
past
do
regret
your
youth
miss
cardinal
you
want
it
back
again
one
day
i
said
to
martin
only
yesterday
neither
aunt
anne
nor
amy
warlock
had
anything
to
say
so
that
quite
suddenly
on
the
entrance
of
tea
conversation
dropped
they
all
sat
there
and
looked
at
one
another
there
was
a
large
silver
tray
with
silver
upon
it
and
a
fat
swelling
china
dish
that
held
hot
buttered
toast
there
was
a
standing
wicker
pyramid
containing
bread
and
butter
plates
of
little
yellow
and
red
cakes
shortbread
and
very
heavy
plum
cake
black
with
currants
warlock
had
ceased
all
conversation
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
preparations
for
tea
the
door
opened
and
john
warlock
and
his
son
came
in
maggie
eyes
lighted
when
she
saw
martin
warlock
she
behaved
as
she
might
have
done
had
she
been
in
her
own
room
at
dreots
she
sprang
up
from
her
chair
and
stood
there
smiling
waiting
for
him
first
his
father
shook
hands
with
her
then
martin
came
and
stood
beside
her
laughing
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
seemed
excited
about
something
but
she
felt
nothing
save
her
pleasure
at
meeting
him
and
it
was
only
when
he
had
moved
on
to
her
aunt
that
she
was
conscious
once
more
of
amy
warlock
eyes
and
wondered
whether
she
had
behaved
badly
in
jumping
up
to
meet
him
as
she
considered
this
her
anger
and
her
confusion
at
her
anger
increased
she
saw
that
martin
was
talking
to
her
aunt
and
did
not
look
at
her
perhaps
he
also
had
thought
her
forward
of
course
that
horrid
sister
of
his
would
think
everything
that
she
did
wrong
but
did
he
surely
he
understood
she
wanted
to
ask
him
and
then
wanted
to
go
home
and
leave
them
all
she
saw
that
her
teacup
was
trembling
in
her
hand
she
steadied
it
upon
her
knee
and
then
her
knee
began
to
quiver
and
all
the
time
amy
warlock
watched
her
she
thought
then
that
she
must
assert
herself
and
show
that
she
was
not
confused
nor
timid
so
she
began
in
a
voice
to
talk
to
warlock
she
told
warlock
that
she
found
harrods
a
confusing
place
that
she
had
not
yet
visited
westminster
abbey
that
her
health
was
quite
good
that
she
had
no
brothers
and
no
sisters
that
she
could
not
play
the
piano
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
she
never
read
books
it
was
after
the
last
of
these
interesting
statements
that
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
as
though
it
had
been
a
brazen
gong
beating
stridently
in
the
vastness
of
a
deserted
cathedral
she
saw
the
old
lady
take
two
pieces
of
buttered
toast
from
the
china
dish
hold
them
tenderly
in
her
hand
and
fling
them
a
swift
glance
before
she
devoured
them
during
that
moment
vision
maggie
discovered
what
so
many
people
of
vaster
experience
both
of
life
and
of
warlock
had
never
discovered
namely
that
the
old
lady
cared
more
for
her
food
than
her
company
maggie
was
suddenly
less
afraid
of
the
whole
family
she
looked
up
then
at
martin
as
though
she
thus
would
prove
her
new
courage
and
he
glancing
across
at
the
same
moment
they
smiled
he
left
his
father
side
and
coming
over
to
her
sat
down
close
to
her
he
dropped
his
voice
in
speaking
to
her
i
been
wanting
to
see
you
he
said
why
she
asked
him
well
he
answered
smiling
at
her
as
though
he
wanted
to
tell
her
something
privately
i
feel
as
though
we
got
a
lot
to
tell
one
another
i
a
stranger
here
really
quite
as
much
as
you
no
you
not
she
said
you
ca
be
so
much
a
stranger
anywhere
because
you
been
all
over
the
world
and
are
ready
for
anything
and
you
i
do
seem
to
manage
the
simplest
things
aunt
elizabeth
and
i
get
lost
the
moment
we
move
outside
the
door
do
you
like
my
dress
she
asked
him
why
he
said
obviously
startled
by
such
a
question
it
splendid
no
you
know
it
is
she
answered
quickly
dropping
her
voice
into
a
confidential
statement
it
all
wrong
i
thought
you
know
why
as
you
been
everywhere
caroline
smith
helped
me
to
choose
it
and
it
looked
all
right
until
i
wore
it
it
me
i
hopeless
to
fit
caroline
says
so
i
do
care
about
clothes
if
only
i
looked
just
like
anybody
else
i
never
bother
again
but
it
so
tiresome
to
have
taken
so
much
trouble
and
then
for
it
to
be
all
wrong
martin
was
then
aware
of
many
things
that
this
was
a
strange
unusual
girl
that
she
reassured
him
as
to
her
interest
her
vitality
her
sincerity
as
no
girl
had
ever
done
before
that
his
sister
was
aware
of
their
intimate
conversation
and
that
she
resented
it
and
that
he
must
see
this
girl
again
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
was
as
liable
as
any
young
man
in
the
world
to
the
most
sudden
and
most
violent
enthusiasms
but
they
had
been
enthusiasms
for
a
pretty
face
for
a
sensual
appeal
for
a
sentimental
moment
here
there
was
no
prettiness
no
sensuality
no
sentiment
there
was
something
so
new
that
he
felt
like
cortez
upon
his
peak
in
darien
it
all
right
he
reassured
her
urgently
it
all
right
i
promise
you
it
is
the
great
thing
is
to
look
yourself
and
you
never
be
the
least
like
any
one
else
he
meant
that
to
be
the
first
open
declaration
of
his
own
particular
discovery
of
her
but
he
was
aware
that
his
sentence
could
have
more
than
one
interpretation
uncomfortably
conscious
then
of
his
sister
regard
of
them
he
looked
up
and
said
amy
miss
cardinal
been
telling
me
how
confusing
london
is
to
her
you
got
as
good
an
idea
of
london
as
any
one
in
the
world
you
should
take
her
to
one
or
two
places
and
show
her
things
amy
warlock
every
line
of
her
stiff
body
firing
at
them
both
her
hostility
answered
oh
i
do
think
miss
cardinal
would
care
for
me
as
a
guide
should
be
able
to
show
her
interesting
things
we
have
scarcely
i
should
fancy
enough
in
common
miss
cardinal
interests
are
i
imagine
very
different
from
my
own
the
tone
the
words
fell
into
the
sudden
silence
like
a
lighted
match
into
water
maggie
her
head
erect
her
voice
in
spite
of
herself
trembling
a
little
answered
why
miss
warlock
i
should
think
of
troubling
you
it
very
kind
of
your
brother
but
one
must
make
one
discoveries
for
oneself
must
one
i
am
already
beginning
to
find
my
way
about
after
that
the
fell
into
complete
disruption
maggie
although
she
did
not
look
could
feel
martin
anger
like
a
flame
beside
her
she
was
aware
that
aunt
anne
and
warlock
were
like
some
beings
from
another
world
distant
from
the
general
confusion
her
one
passionate
desire
was
to
get
up
and
leave
the
place
to
her
intense
relief
she
heard
aunt
anne
clear
voice
i
think
warlock
we
must
be
turning
homewards
shall
i
send
you
those
papers
about
the
perteway
mission
such
splendid
work
i
think
it
would
interest
you
it
was
as
though
a
hole
had
suddenly
opened
in
the
floor
of
the
neat
little
and
they
were
all
hurrying
to
leave
without
if
possible
tumbling
into
it
there
was
a
general
shaking
of
hands
warlock
said
kindly
to
maggie
do
come
soon
again
dear
it
does
an
old
lady
good
to
see
young
faces
martin
was
near
the
door
he
almost
crushed
maggie
hand
in
his
i
must
see
you
soon
he
whispered
free
from
the
house
maggie
and
her
aunt
walked
home
in
complete
silence
maggie
heart
was
a
confusion
of
rage
surprise
loneliness
and
pride
no
one
had
ever
behaved
like
that
to
her
before
and
what
had
she
done
what
was
there
about
her
that
people
hated
why
why
she
felt
as
though
in
some
way
it
had
all
been
aunt
fault
why
did
not
aunt
anne
speak
well
if
they
all
hated
her
she
would
go
on
her
own
way
she
did
not
care
but
alone
in
her
room
her
face
indignant
proud
quivering
surprising
her
in
the
long
mirror
by
its
strangeness
and
causing
her
to
feel
because
it
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
her
more
lonely
than
ever
she
burst
out
i
ca
stand
it
i
ca
stand
it
i
get
away
so
soon
as
ever
i
can

maggie
and
martin
that
moment
in
her
bedroom
altered
for
maggie
the
course
of
all
her
future
life
she
had
never
before
been
consciously
a
rebel
she
had
only
a
week
before
almost
acquiesced
in
the
thought
that
she
would
remain
in
her
aunts
house
for
the
rest
of
her
days
now
magnus
the
warlocks
and
her
new
dress
had
combined
to
fire
her
determination
she
saw
quite
suddenly
that
she
must
escape
at
the
first
possible
moment
the
house
that
had
been
until
now
the
refuge
into
which
she
had
escaped
became
the
place
for
her
new
adventure
until
now
the
things
in
the
house
had
been
there
to
receive
her
as
one
of
themselves
from
this
moment
they
were
there
to
prevent
if
possible
her
release
she
felt
everything
instantly
hostile
they
all
thomas
the
cat
edward
the
parrot
the
very
sofas
and
chairs
and
cushions
were
determined
not
to
let
her
go
she
saw
more
than
ever
before
that
her
aunts
were
preparing
some
religious
trap
for
her
they
were
very
quiet
about
it
they
did
not
urge
her
or
bully
her
but
the
subtle
silent
influence
went
on
so
that
the
very
the
very
scuttles
that
held
the
coal
became
secret
messengers
to
hale
her
into
the
chapel
and
shut
her
in
there
for
ever
after
her
first
visit
there
the
chapel
became
a
nightmare
to
her
because
at
once
she
had
felt
its
power
she
had
known
she
had
always
known
and
it
had
not
needed
magnus
to
tell
her
that
there
was
something
in
this
religion
yes
even
in
the
wretched
dirt
and
disorder
of
her
father
soul
but
with
that
realisation
that
there
was
indeed
something
had
come
also
the
resolved
conviction
that
life
could
not
be
happy
simple
successful
unless
one
broke
from
that
power
utterly
refused
its
dictates
gave
no
hearing
to
its
messages
surrendered
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
its
influence
had
not
some
one
said
to
her
once
or
was
it
not
in
her
little
red
a
kempis
that
once
caught
one
might
never
escape
again
she
would
prove
that
in
her
own
struggle
and
independence
to
be
untrue
the
chapel
should
not
have
her
nor
her
father
ghost
nor
the
dim
thoughts
and
memories
that
rose
like
dark
shadows
in
her
soul
and
vanished
again
she
would
believe
in
nothing
save
what
she
could
see
listen
to
nothing
that
was
not
clear
and
simple
before
her
she
was
mistress
of
her
own
soul
she
did
not
in
this
fashion
think
things
out
for
herself
to
herself
she
simply
expressed
it
that
she
was
going
to
lead
her
own
life
to
earn
her
own
living
to
fight
for
herself
and
that
the
sooner
she
escaped
this
gloomy
damp
and
house
the
better
she
would
never
say
her
prayers
again
she
would
never
read
the
bible
again
to
herself
or
any
one
else
she
would
never
kneel
on
those
hard
chapel
kneelers
again
she
would
never
listen
to
warlock
sermons
again
once
she
had
escaped
meanwhile
she
said
nothing
at
all
to
herself
about
martin
warlock
who
was
really
at
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
she
began
at
once
to
take
steps
two
years
before
this
a
lady
had
paid
with
her
sister
a
short
visit
to
dreots
and
had
taken
a
great
liking
to
maggie
they
had
made
friends
and
this
lady
a
miss
katherine
trenchard
had
begged
maggie
to
let
her
know
if
she
came
to
london
and
needed
help
or
advice
miss
trenchard
divided
her
life
between
london
and
a
place
called
garth
in
roselands
in
glebeshire
and
maggie
did
not
know
where
she
would
be
now
but
after
some
little
hesitation
she
wrote
a
letter
speaking
of
the
death
of
her
father
and
of
her
desire
to
find
some
work
in
london
and
directed
it
to
garth
now
of
course
she
must
post
it
herself
no
allowing
it
to
lie
on
the
with
old
martha
to
finger
it
and
the
aunts
to
speculate
upon
it
and
finally
challenge
her
with
its
destiny
on
a
bright
evening
when
the
house
was
as
dark
as
a
shut
box
and
an
early
star
frightened
at
its
irregular
and
lonely
appearance
suddenly
flashed
like
a
curl
of
a
golden
whip
across
the
sky
maggie
slipped
out
of
the
house
she
realised
with
a
triumphant
and
determined
nod
of
her
head
that
she
had
never
been
out
alone
in
london
before
a
ridiculous
and
shameful
fact
she
knew
that
there
was
a
just
round
the
corner
but
because
she
had
a
hat
upon
her
head
and
shoes
upon
her
feet
she
thought
that
she
might
as
well
post
it
in
the
strand
an
exciting
river
of
tempestuous
sound
into
which
she
had
as
yet
scarcely
penetrated
she
slipped
out
of
the
front
door
then
waited
a
moment
looking
back
at
the
silent
house
no
one
stirred
in
their
street
the
noise
of
the
strand
came
up
to
her
like
wind
beyond
a
valley
she
must
have
felt
in
that
instant
that
she
was
making
some
plunge
into
hazardous
waters
and
she
must
have
hesitated
as
to
whether
she
would
not
spring
back
into
the
quiet
house
lock
and
bolt
the
door
and
never
go
out
again
but
after
that
one
glance
she
went
forward
she
had
never
before
in
her
life
been
on
any
errand
alone
and
at
this
evening
hour
the
strand
was
very
full
she
stood
still
clinging
to
the
safe
privacy
of
her
own
street
and
peering
over
into
the
blaze
and
quiver
of
the
tumult
in
the
strand
end
of
her
own
street
there
were
several
dramatic
agencies
a
book
and
print
shop
with
piles
of
dirty
music
in
the
barrow
outside
the
window
a
little
restaurant
with
cold
beef
an
ancient
chicken
eggs
and
sponge
cakes
under
glass
domes
in
the
window
everywhere
about
her
were
dim
doors
glimpses
of
twisting
stairs
dusty
windows
and
figures
flitting
up
and
down
in
and
out
as
though
they
were
marionettes
pulled
by
invisible
strings
to
fulfil
some
figure
these
were
all
in
the
dusk
of
the
a
large
draper
with
shirts
and
collars
and
grinning
wax
boys
in
sailor
suits
caught
with
its
front
windows
the
strand
lamps
it
was
beside
the
shop
that
maggie
stood
for
an
instant
hesitating
she
could
see
no
she
could
see
nothing
save
the
streams
of
human
beings
slipping
like
water
between
the
banks
of
houses
she
hesitated
clinging
to
the
draper
shop
then
suddenly
catching
sight
of
the
a
few
yards
down
the
street
she
let
herself
go
had
a
momentary
sensation
of
swimming
in
a
sea
desperately
crowded
with
other
bodies
fought
against
the
fierce
gaze
of
lights
that
beat
straight
upon
her
eyes
found
the
box
slipped
in
the
letter
and
then
almost
at
once
was
back
in
her
quiet
quarters
again
she
turned
and
her
heart
beating
hurried
home
the
house
door
was
still
ajar
she
pushed
it
back
slipped
inside
caught
her
breath
and
listened
then
she
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
and
with
that
little
act
of
attempted
secrecy
realised
that
she
was
now
a
rebel
that
things
could
never
be
for
her
the
same
again
as
they
had
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
that
glittering
crowd
the
lamps
the
smells
the
sounds
had
concentrated
themselves
into
a
little
fiery
charm
that
held
her
heart
within
a
flaming
circle
she
felt
the
most
audacious
creature
in
the
world
and
also
the
most
ignorant
not
helpless
no
never
helpless
but
so
ignorant
that
all
her
life
that
had
seemed
to
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
so
tensely
crowded
with
events
and
crises
was
now
empty
and
barren
like
the
old
cab
at
home
she
did
not
want
to
offend
her
aunts
and
hurt
their
feelings
but
she
was
a
living
breathing
independent
creature
and
she
must
go
her
own
way
neither
they
nor
their
chapel
should
stop
her
no
not
the
chapel
nor
any
one
in
it
she
was
standing
motionless
in
the
dark
cold
hall
wondering
whether
any
one
had
heard
her
enter
when
she
was
suddenly
conscious
of
two
eyes
that
watched
her
two
steady
fiery
eyes
suspended
as
it
seemed
in
mid
air
she
realised
that
it
was
the
cat
the
cat
hated
her
and
she
hated
it
she
had
not
realised
that
before
but
now
with
the
illumination
of
the
lighted
street
behind
her
she
realised
it
the
cat
was
the
spirit
of
the
chapel
watching
her
spying
upon
her
to
see
that
she
did
not
escape
the
cat
knew
that
she
had
posted
her
letter
and
to
whom
she
had
posted
it
she
advanced
to
the
bottom
of
the
stair
and
said
brr
you
horrid
thing
i
hate
you
and
instantly
the
two
fiery
eyes
had
vanished
but
now
in
their
place
the
whole
house
seemed
to
be
watching
so
silent
and
attentive
was
it
and
the
odour
of
damp
biscuits
and
wet
umbrellas
seemed
to
be
everywhere
just
then
old
martha
came
out
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
and
standing
upon
a
chair
lit
the
great
ugly
gas
over
the
middle
of
the
door
why
miss
maggie
she
said
in
her
soft
surprised
whisper
looking
as
she
always
did
beyond
the
girl
into
darkness
i
been
out
said
maggie
defiantly
not
all
alone
miss
all
alone
said
maggie
why
not
i
can
look
after
myself
well
there
your
uncle
waiting
in
the
just
come
said
the
old
woman
climbing
down
from
the
chair
with
that
silent
imperturbable
discontent
that
always
frightened
maggie
uncle
mathew
here
in
this
house
maggie
even
in
the
moment
of
her
first
astonishment
was
amazed
at
her
own
delight
that
she
should
ever
feel
that
about
uncle
mathew
truly
it
showed
how
unhappy
she
had
been
and
she
ran
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
and
pushed
back
the
door
uncle
mathew
she
cried
then
at
the
sight
of
him
she
stood
where
she
was
the
man
who
faced
her
with
all
his
old
confusion
of
nervousness
and
uneasy
geniality
was
indeed
uncle
mathew
but
uncle
mathew
glorified
shabbily
glorified
and
at
the
same
time
a
little
abashed
as
though
she
had
caught
him
in
the
act
of
laying
a
mine
that
would
blow
up
the
whole
house
he
was
wearing
finer
clothes
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
in
before
a
frock
coat
quite
new
but
fitting
him
badly
so
that
it
was
buttoned
too
tightly
across
his
stomach
and
loose
across
the
back
he
had
a
white
flower
in
his
and
a
rather
soiled
white
handkerchief
protruded
from
his
one
leg
of
his
dark
grey
trousers
had
been
creased
in
two
places
and
there
were
little
spots
of
blood
on
his
high
white
collar
because
he
had
cut
himself
shaving
his
complexion
was
of
the
same
old
suppressed
purple
but
his
little
eyes
were
bright
and
shining
and
active
they
danced
towards
maggie
his
scanty
locks
had
been
carefully
brushed
over
his
bald
head
and
his
hands
although
they
were
still
puffed
and
swollen
were
whiter
than
maggie
had
ever
seen
them
but
it
was
in
the
end
his
attitude
of
confused
defiance
that
made
her
pause
what
had
he
been
doing
or
what
did
he
intend
to
do
he
was
prosperous
she
could
see
and
knowing
him
as
she
did
she
was
afraid
of
his
prosperity
she
had
never
in
her
life
realised
so
clearly
as
she
did
now
that
he
was
a
wicked
old
man
and
still
she
was
glad
to
see
him
he
was
an
odd
enough
creature
in
that
room
and
that
she
was
aware
pleased
her
well
my
dear
he
said
very
genially
as
though
they
met
again
after
an
hour
parting
how
are
you
i
very
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
well
too
and
quite
smart
your
aunts
dressed
you
up
i
thought
i
must
look
at
you
i
staying
just
round
the
corner
and
my
first
thought
was
wonder
how
she
getting
on
in
all
that
you
bet
she
keeping
her
head
and
so
you
are
one
can
see
at
a
glance
she
went
up
to
him
kissed
him
and
smelt
whisky
and
some
scent
that
had
geraniums
in
it
he
put
his
arm
round
her
with
his
old
unsteady
gesture
and
held
her
to
him
for
a
moment
then
patted
her
back
with
his
large
soft
hand
your
aunt
a
long
time
i
been
waiting
half
an
hour
they
been
to
some
meeting
she
stood
looking
at
him
with
her
fine
steady
gaze
that
had
always
made
him
afraid
of
her
and
did
so
to
his
own
surprise
again
now
he
had
thought
that
his
clothes
would
have
saved
him
from
that
his
fingers
felt
at
his
looking
at
him
she
said
uncle
i
want
to
get
away
out
of
this
at
once
no
they
horrid
to
me
every
one
been
very
kind
but
i
afraid
of
it
all
of
never
getting
out
of
it
and
i
want
to
be
independent
she
stopped
with
a
little
breathless
gasp
because
she
heard
the
close
ah
they
here
do
tell
them
anything
we
talk
afterwards
his
eyes
glittered
with
satisfaction
i
knew
you
would
my
dear
i
knew
you
would
be
able
to
stand
it
i
get
you
out
of
it
trust
me
the
door
opened
and
aunt
anne
came
in
she
had
been
prepared
by
martha
for
her
visitor
and
she
came
forward
to
him
now
with
the
dignity
and
kindly
patronage
of
some
lady
abbess
receiving
the
miscreant
and
boorish
yokel
of
a
neighbouring
village
and
yet
how
fine
she
was
as
maggie
watched
her
she
thought
of
what
she
would
give
to
have
some
of
that
and
dignity
and
decision
was
it
her
religion
that
gave
her
that
or
only
her
own
no
there
was
something
behind
aunt
anne
something
stronger
than
she
something
that
warlock
also
knew
and
it
was
this
something
that
uncle
mathew
met
with
his
own
hostility
as
he
looked
up
now
at
his
sister
and
greeted
her
why
mathew
you
never
told
us
i
would
have
hurried
back
and
now
elizabeth
i
afraid
has
gone
on
to
see
some
friends
she
will
be
so
disappointed
but
at
least
you
had
maggie
to
entertain
you
a
quick
glance
was
exchanged
between
uncle
and
niece
yes
he
said
we
had
a
talk
anne
thank
you
and
it
matter
about
elizabeth
because
i
staying
close
here
in
henrietta
street
and
i
be
in
again
if
i
may
i
just
looked
in
to
ask
whether
maggie
might
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
at
my
little
place
it
a
most
respectable
place
i
come
and
fetch
her
of
course
and
bring
her
back
afterwards
of
course
aunt
anne
could
not
refuse
but
oh
how
maggie
saw
that
she
wanted
to
the
battle
that
followed
was
silent
uncle
mathew
eyes
narrowed
themselves
to
fiery
malicious
points
he
dropped
them
and
moved
his
feet
restlessly
on
the
soft
carpet
quite
respectable
he
repeated
aunt
anne
smiled
gently
why
of
course
mathew
i
know
you
look
after
maggie
it
will
be
a
change
for
her
she
been
having
rather
a
dull
time
here
i
afraid
then
there
was
silence
maggie
wanted
to
speak
but
the
words
would
not
come
and
she
had
the
curious
sensation
that
even
if
she
did
find
them
no
one
would
hear
them
then
uncle
mathew
suddenly
said
stumbled
over
his
boots
by
the
door
shot
out
seven
maggie
and
was
gone
well
that
will
be
nice
for
you
maggie
said
anne
looking
at
her
yes
said
maggie
you
do
mind
do
you
no
dear
of
course
not
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
maggie
broke
out
desperately
i
know
not
satisfying
you
and
yet
you
wo
say
anything
do
tell
me
and
try
anything
almost
anything
then
the
sudden
memory
of
her
own
posted
letter
silenced
her
was
that
readiness
to
do
anything
had
that
not
been
rebellion
and
had
she
not
asked
uncle
mathew
to
help
her
to
escape
the
consciousness
of
her
dishonesty
coloured
her
cheek
with
crimson
then
aunt
anne
very
tenderly
put
her
hand
on
her
shoulder
will
you
really
do
anything
for
me
maggie
for
me
her
voice
was
gentle
and
her
eyes
had
tears
in
them
if
you
will
there
are
things
very
close
to
my
heart
maggie
turned
away
trembling
she
hung
her
head
then
with
a
sudden
movement
walked
to
the
door
you
must
tell
me
she
said
what
you
want
i
try
i
understand
then
as
though
she
was
aware
that
she
was
fighting
the
whole
room
which
had
already
almost
entrapped
her
and
that
the
fight
was
too
much
for
her
she
went
when
she
came
to
her
own
room
and
thought
about
her
invitation
she
wished
with
a
sudden
change
of
mood
that
she
had
a
pretty
frock
or
two
she
would
have
loved
to
have
been
grand
and
now
the
best
that
she
could
do
was
to
add
her
coral
necklace
and
a
little
gold
brooch
that
years
ago
her
father
had
given
her
to
the
black
dress
that
she
was
already
wearing
she
realised
with
a
strange
little
pang
of
loneliness
that
she
had
not
had
one
evening
fun
since
her
arrival
in
london
no
not
one
and
she
would
not
have
captured
had
aunt
anne
been
able
to
prevent
it
then
as
her
mind
returned
back
to
her
uncle
she
felt
with
a
throb
of
excited
anticipation
that
perhaps
after
all
this
evening
was
to
prove
the
of
her
life
her
little
escape
into
the
streets
her
posting
of
the
letter
had
been
followed
so
immediately
by
uncle
mathew
visit
and
now
this
invitation
no
one
can
keep
me
if
i
want
to
go
and
the
old
outside
seemed
to
tick
in
reply
can
no
one
keep
her
if
she
wants
to
go
she
finished
her
preparations
as
she
fastened
the
coral
necklace
round
her
neck
the
face
of
martin
warlock
was
suddenly
before
her
he
had
been
perhaps
at
her
elbow
all
day
i
like
him
and
i
think
he
likes
me
she
said
to
the
mirror
i
got
one
friend
and
her
thought
still
further
was
that
even
if
he
like
her
he
could
prevent
her
liking
him
she
went
down
to
the
and
found
uncle
mathew
alone
waiting
for
her
here
i
am
maggie
he
said
and
let
get
out
of
this
as
quick
as
we
can
i
must
go
and
say
to
the
aunts
she
said
she
went
upstairs
to
aunt
anne
bedroom
entering
it
was
always
to
her
like
passing
into
a
shadowed
church
after
the
hot
sunshine
the
long
thin
room
with
high
slender
windows
the
long
hard
bed
of
the
most
perfect
whiteness
and
neatness
the
heavy
picture
of
the
ascension
over
the
bed
and
the
utter
stillness
broken
by
no
sound
of
clock
or
bell
even
the
fire
seemed
frozen
into
a
glassy
purity
in
the
grate
her
aunt
was
sitting
as
so
often
maggie
found
her
in
a
chair
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
staring
in
front
of
her
her
eyes
were
like
the
open
eyes
of
a
dead
woman
it
was
as
though
with
a
great
effort
of
almost
desperate
concentration
she
were
driving
her
vision
against
some
obstinate
world
of
opposition
and
the
whole
of
life
had
meanwhile
stayed
to
watch
the
issue
a
thin
pale
light
from
some
street
lamp
lay
a
faintly
golden
shadow
across
the
white
ceiling
maggie
stood
by
the
door
i
come
to
say
aunt
ah
maggie
dear
is
that
you
the
pale
oval
face
turned
towards
her
you
wo
be
very
late
will
you
had
i
better
have
a
key
not
to
bother
martha
oh
martha
wo
have
gone
to
bed
maggie
felt
as
though
her
whole
evening
would
be
spoilt
did
she
know
that
martha
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
end
of
it
oh
but
it
will
be
such
a
pity
martha
will
let
you
in
dear
come
and
kiss
me
i
hope
that
enjoy
yourself
and
then
the
strangest
thing
happened
maggie
bent
down
she
felt
a
tear
upon
her
cheek
and
then
the
thin
strong
arms
held
her
for
an
instant
in
an
almost
threatening
embrace
dear
aunt
she
said
but
outside
the
room
she
had
to
stand
for
a
moment
in
the
dark
passage
to
regain
her
control
her
heart
was
beating
with
wild
unreasoning
terror
although
she
had
brushed
her
cheek
with
her
hand
the
cold
touch
of
the
tears
still
lingered
there
outside
the
house
they
were
free
it
looked
so
close
and
dark
behind
them
that
maggie
shivered
a
little
and
put
her
arm
through
her
uncle
that
all
right
he
said
patting
her
hand
we
going
to
enjoy
ourselves
she
looked
up
and
saw
martin
warlock
facing
her
the
unexpected
meeting
held
both
of
them
silent
for
a
moment
to
her
it
seemed
that
he
had
risen
out
of
the
very
stones
of
the
pavement
at
her
bidding
to
make
her
evening
wonderful
he
looked
so
strong
so
square
so
solid
after
the
phantom
imaginations
of
the
house
that
she
had
left
that
the
sight
of
him
was
a
step
straight
into
the
heart
of
comfort
and
reassurance
i
was
just
coming
he
said
looking
at
her
to
leave
a
note
for
miss
cardinal
from
my
father
she
in
maggie
said
oh
it
was
to
bother
her
only
to
leave
the
note
about
some
meeting
i
think
we
just
going
out
this
is
my
uncle
mr
warlock
the
two
men
shook
hands
mathew
cardinal
smiled
his
eyes
closed
his
greeting
had
an
urgency
in
it
as
though
he
had
suddenly
made
some
discovery
that
gratified
and
amused
him
very
glad
to
meet
you
very
glad
indeed
sir
any
friend
of
my
niece
i
know
your
father
sir
know
him
and
admire
him
they
all
turned
down
the
street
together
uncle
mathew
talked
and
then
quite
suddenly
stopping
under
a
as
though
within
the
circle
of
light
his
charm
were
stronger
he
said
i
suppose
warlock
you
would
do
me
the
great
the
extreme
honour
of
dining
with
myself
and
my
niece
at
my
humble
little
inn
a
little
sudden
i
hope
you
forgive
the
discourtesy
but
knowing
your
father
martin
looked
straight
into
maggie
eyes
oh
please
do
she
said
her
heart
beating
as
it
seemed
against
her
eyes
so
that
she
dropped
them
well
he
hesitated
it
very
good
of
you
cardinal
very
kind
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
going
to
dine
alone
just
a
chop
you
know
somewhere
if
it
really
not
inconvenient
i
be
delighted
they
walked
on
together
as
they
passed
into
garrick
street
she
knew
that
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
been
so
glad
to
be
with
any
one
that
she
had
never
so
completely
trusted
any
one
that
she
would
like
to
be
with
him
often
to
look
after
him
perhaps
and
to
be
looked
after
by
him
her
feeling
for
him
was
almost
sexless
because
she
had
never
thought
as
most
girls
do
of
love
and
the
intrigue
and
coquetry
of
love
she
was
so
simple
as
to
be
shameless
and
at
once
if
he
had
asked
her
then
in
the
street
to
marry
him
she
would
have
said
yes
without
hesitation
or
fear
or
any
analysis
she
would
like
to
look
after
him
as
well
as
herself
there
were
things
she
was
sure
that
she
could
do
for
him
and
she
would
be
no
burden
to
him
because
she
intended
in
any
case
to
lead
her
own
life
she
would
simply
lead
it
with
a
companion
instead
of
without
one
he
must
have
felt
as
he
walked
with
her
this
trust
and
simplicity
she
was
certainly
the
most
extraordinary
girl
whom
he
had
ever
met
and
he
met
a
number
he
could
believe
every
word
she
said
he
had
never
known
any
one
so
direct
and
simple
and
honest
and
yet
with
that
she
was
not
a
fool
as
most
honest
girls
were
no
she
was
not
a
fool
he
would
have
given
anything
to
be
as
sure
of
himself
she
was
plain
but
then
was
she
as
they
passed
beneath
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
his
heart
gave
a
sudden
beat
her
face
was
so
good
her
eyes
so
true
her
mouth
so
strong
she
was
like
a
boy
rather
and
of
course
she
was
dressed
badly
but
he
wanted
to
look
after
her
he
was
sure
that
she
knew
so
little
of
the
world
and
would
be
so
easily
deceived
but
who
was
he
to
look
after
any
one
he
knew
that
she
would
trust
him
utterly
and
trust
him
not
only
because
she
was
ignorant
of
the
world
but
also
because
she
was
herself
so
true
at
the
thought
of
this
trust
his
heart
suddenly
warmed
partly
with
shame
and
partly
with
pride
they
walked
very
happily
along
laughing
and
talking
they
turned
into
henrietta
street
misty
with
lamps
that
were
dim
in
a
thin
evening
fog
and
at
the
corner
of
the
street
facing
the
square
was
uncle
hotel
it
was
a
place
for
the
use
in
the
main
of
commercial
gentlemen
and
it
was
said
by
eager
searchers
after
local
colour
to
have
retained
a
great
deal
of
the
dickens
spirit
in
the
hall
there
was
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
red
nose
a
soiled
waiter
a
desolate
palm
and
a
lady
all
rings
and
black
silk
in
a
kind
of
wooden
cage
down
the
stairs
came
a
dim
vapour
that
smelt
of
beef
whisky
and
tobacco
and
in
the
distance
was
the
regular
click
of
and
the
brazen
muffled
tones
of
a
gramophone
uncle
mathew
seemed
perfectly
at
home
here
and
it
was
strange
to
maggie
that
he
should
be
so
nervous
with
aunt
anne
his
own
sister
when
he
could
be
so
happily
familiar
with
the
powdered
lady
in
the
black
silk
we
to
have
dinner
in
a
private
room
upstairs
said
uncle
mathew
in
a
voice
that
was
casual
and
at
the
same
time
important
he
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
maggie
had
read
in
some
old
bound
volume
at
home
a
very
gruesome
account
of
the
life
and
misdeeds
of
palmer
the
rugeley
poisoner
the
impression
that
still
remained
with
her
was
of
a
man
standing
in
the
shadowy
hall
of
just
such
an
hotel
as
this
and
pouring
poison
into
a
glass
which
he
held
up
against
the
light
this
picture
had
been
vividly
with
her
during
her
childhood
and
she
felt
that
this
must
have
been
the
very
hotel
where
those
fearful
deeds
occurred
and
that
the
ghost
of
palmer
friend
must
at
this
very
moment
be
writhing
in
an
upstairs
bedroom
writhing
as
she
so
fearfully
remembered
bent
like
a
hoop
however
these
reminiscences
did
not
in
the
least
terrify
her
she
welcomed
their
definite
outlines
in
contrast
with
the
shadowy
possibilities
of
her
aunts
house
and
she
had
martin
warlock
she
had
never
been
so
happy
in
all
her
life
a
dismal
little
waiter
with
a
very
soiled
shirt
and
a
black
tie
under
his
ear
guided
them
down
into
a
dark
passage
and
flung
open
the
door
of
a
this
room
was
dark
and
sizzling
with
strange
noises
a
burning
low
was
hissing
some
papers
rustled
in
the
breeze
from
the
window
and
a
fire
overburdened
with
the
weight
of
black
coal
made
frantic
little
spurts
of
resistance
a
white
cloth
was
laid
on
the
table
and
there
were
glasses
and
knives
and
forks
a
portrait
of
her
late
majesty
queen
victoria
confronted
a
horse
desperately
winning
a
race
in
which
he
had
apparently
no
competitors
there
was
a
of
imitation
marble
and
a
with
some
torn
paper
editions
languishing
upon
it
beyond
the
open
window
there
was
a
purple
haze
and
a
yellow
mist
also
a
bell
rang
and
carts
rattled
over
the
cobbles
the
waiter
shut
out
these
sights
and
sounds
gave
the
tablecloth
a
stroke
with
his
dirty
hand
and
left
the
room
they
continued
their
cheerful
conversation
martin
laughing
at
nothing
at
all
and
maggie
smiling
and
uncle
mathew
stroking
his
mouth
and
sharpening
his
eyes
and
standing
in
his
uneasy
fashion
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
maggie
realised
that
her
uncle
was
trying
to
be
most
especially
pleasant
to
young
warlock
she
wondered
why
she
also
remembered
what
he
had
said
to
her
about
martin
father
no
he
had
changed
she
could
not
follow
his
motives
as
she
had
once
been
able
to
do
then
he
had
simply
been
a
foolish
drunken
but
old
man
then
warlock
on
his
side
seemed
to
like
her
uncle
that
was
an
extraordinary
thing
or
was
he
only
being
friendly
because
he
was
happy
no
she
remembered
his
face
as
he
had
joined
them
that
evening
he
had
not
been
happy
then
she
liked
him
the
more
because
she
knew
that
he
needed
help
the
meal
produced
at
last
by
the
poor
little
waiter
was
very
merry
the
food
was
not
wonderful
the
thick
was
cold
the
sole
bones
and
skin
the
roast
beef
tepid
and
the
heavy
the
men
drank
whiskies
and
sodas
and
maggie
noticed
that
her
uncle
drank
very
little
and
then
with
apologies
to
maggie
they
smoked
cigars
and
she
sat
before
the
dismal
fire
in
an
old
armchair
with
a
hole
in
it
martin
warlock
talked
in
a
most
delightful
way
about
his
travels
and
uncle
mathew
asked
him
questions
that
were
not
after
all
so
stupid
what
had
happened
to
him
had
maggie
always
undervalued
him
or
was
it
that
he
was
sober
now
and
his
fat
round
thighs
seemed
stronger
his
hands
seemed
cleaner
the
veins
in
his
face
were
not
so
purple
she
remembered
the
night
when
he
had
come
into
her
room
she
had
been
able
to
manage
him
then
would
she
be
able
to
manage
him
now
after
dinner
he
grew
very
restless
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
door
then
to
his
watch
then
to
his
companions
he
smiled
uneasily
pulling
his
moustache
then
jumping
to
his
feet
tried
to
speak
with
an
easy
i
must
leave
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
matter
of
business
only
in
this
hotel
downstairs
yes
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
little
matter
urgent
i
sure
you
forgive
me
for
a
moment
maggie
was
frightened
she
was
here
in
a
strange
hotel
in
a
strange
room
with
a
man
whom
she
scarcely
knew
then
she
looked
up
into
young
warlock
face
and
was
reassured
she
could
trust
him
he
stood
with
his
arm
on
the
shabby
dusty
mantelpiece
looking
down
upon
her
with
his
kindly
smile
so
kindly
that
she
felt
that
he
was
younger
than
she
and
needed
protection
in
a
world
that
was
filled
with
designing
uncle
mathews
and
mysterious
aunt
annes
and
horrible
miss
warlocks
he
on
his
side
as
he
looked
down
at
her
was
surprised
at
his
own
excitement
his
heart
was
beating
his
hand
trembling
before
this
plain
ordinary
unattractive
girl
unattractive
physically
but
not
uninteresting
one
of
the
most
interesting
human
beings
whom
he
had
ever
met
simply
because
she
was
utterly
unlike
any
one
else
he
felt
shame
before
her
because
he
knew
that
she
would
believe
every
word
that
he
said
in
that
she
was
simple
but
he
would
be
bothered
if
she
was
simple
in
anything
else
she
had
made
up
her
mind
he
knew
it
as
well
as
though
she
had
told
him
to
trust
him
absolutely
and
he
knew
well
enough
how
little
he
was
to
be
trusted
and
because
of
that
faith
and
because
of
that
trust
he
felt
that
she
was
more
reliable
than
he
could
have
believed
that
changing
fickle
human
being
would
ever
be
how
secure
he
might
feel
with
her
then
as
he
thought
that
he
realised
how
troubled
he
was
about
his
life
at
home
during
the
last
weeks
amy
hated
him
his
mother
hid
herself
from
him
and
his
father
love
frightened
him
already
he
had
found
himself
telling
lies
to
avoid
the
chapel
services
and
the
meetings
with
thurston
and
the
rest
his
father
love
for
him
had
something
terrible
in
it
and
although
he
returned
it
he
could
not
live
up
to
that
fire
and
heat
no
he
saw
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
remain
for
long
at
home
on
the
other
hand
go
back
to
the
old
wandering
life
he
would
not
he
had
had
enough
of
that
and
its
rotten
carelessness
and
shabbiness
what
a
girl
this
would
be
to
settle
down
with
somewhere
so
strange
that
she
would
be
always
interesting
so
faithful
that
she
would
be
always
there
nor
was
he
entirely
selfish
her
childishness
her
ignorance
appealed
to
him
for
protection
she
had
no
one
but
those
old
aunts
to
care
for
her
she
was
poor
and
rebellious
and
ignorant
warlock
was
beyond
the
normal
charity
of
man
much
of
his
weakness
came
from
that
very
kindness
as
he
saw
which
way
he
was
going
he
tried
to
pull
himself
back
he
could
not
protect
her
he
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
why
he
could
do
her
nothing
but
harm
and
yet
he
went
on
he
took
a
chair
close
to
her
and
sat
down
he
who
had
known
in
his
time
many
women
could
see
how
happy
she
was
that
happiness
excited
him
suddenly
he
held
her
hand
she
did
not
remove
it
look
here
he
began
and
he
was
surprised
at
the
hoarseness
of
his
voice
your
uncle
will
be
back
in
a
moment
and
we
never
have
a
chance
of
being
alone
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
he
felt
her
hand
move
in
his
that
stir
was
so
helpless
that
he
suddenly
determined
to
be
honest
i
think
you
trust
me
wo
you
he
asked
yes
she
said
well
you
must
he
went
on
hurriedly
his
eyes
on
the
door
not
worse
i
suppose
than
other
men
but
all
the
same
i
not
to
be
trusted
and
when
i
say
i
not
to
be
trusted
i
mean
that
i
myself
do
know
whether
i
keep
my
word
from
one
minute
to
another
sure
you
do
know
very
much
about
men
i
could
see
it
at
once
from
the
way
you
spoke
she
looked
up
her
clear
unconfused
unquestioning
eyes
facing
him
i
knew
my
father
well
she
said
we
were
quite
alone
for
years
together
and
then
uncle
mathew
oh
your
father
your
uncle
he
answered
quickly
they
do
count
what
i
mean
is
that
you
must
think
men
are
scoundrels
just
because
they
act
badly
i
swear
that
nine
out
of
ten
of
them
never
mean
to
do
any
harm
and
they
think
they
speaking
the
truth
at
the
time
but
anything
for
them
and
then
they
in
a
mess
and
all
they
think
about
is
how
to
get
out
of
it
then
it
every
man
for
himself
maggie
shook
her
head
i
always
known
that
i
have
to
manage
for
myself
she
said
never
expected
any
one
to
do
anything
for
me
so
i
not
likely
to
be
disappointed
now
he
moved
a
little
closer
to
her
and
held
her
hand
more
firmly
even
as
he
did
so
something
in
his
heart
reproached
him
but
now
the
reproach
was
very
far
away
like
an
echo
of
some
earlier
voice
do
you
know
you
a
wonderful
girl
he
said
i
knew
you
were
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
you
the
most
independent
person
ever
known
you
ca
guess
how
i
admire
that
and
all
the
same
not
happy
are
you
you
want
to
get
out
of
it
do
you
she
thought
for
a
little
while
before
she
nodded
her
head
i
suppose
as
a
fact
she
said
i
do
if
you
want
to
know
and
you
must
tell
anybody
i
posted
a
letter
to
a
lady
whom
i
met
once
who
told
me
if
ever
i
wanted
anything
to
write
to
her
i
asked
her
for
some
work
i
got
three
hundred
pounds
of
my
own
it
is
very
much
i
know
but
i
could
start
on
it
i
do
want
to
do
wrong
to
my
aunts
who
are
very
kind
to
me
but
i
not
happy
there
it
be
true
to
say
i
happy
you
see
she
dropped
her
voice
a
little
they
want
to
make
me
religious
and
i
had
so
much
of
that
with
father
already
i
feel
as
though
they
were
pressing
me
into
it
somehow
and
that
i
should
wake
up
one
morning
and
find
i
should
never
escape
again
there
so
much
goes
on
that
i
do
understand
and
it
only
the
chapel
aunt
anne
very
quiet
but
she
makes
you
feel
quite
helpless
sometimes
and
perhaps
one
will
get
more
and
more
helpless
the
longer
one
stays
i
do
want
to
be
helpless
ever
nor
religious
she
ended
why
that
just
my
position
he
continued
eagerly
i
came
home
as
happily
as
anything
i
almost
forgotten
all
that
had
been
when
i
was
a
boy
how
i
was
baptized
and
thought
i
belonged
to
god
and
was
so
proud
and
stuck
up
that
all
seems
nonsense
when
you
roughing
it
with
other
men
who
think
about
nothing
but
the
day
work
then
i
came
home
meaning
to
settle
down
i
wanted
to
see
my
governor
too
always
cared
for
him
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
but
i
tell
you
now
i
simply
do
know
what
going
on
at
home
they
want
to
catch
me
in
a
trap
that
what
it
feels
like
to
make
me
what
i
was
as
a
kid
it
strange
but
there
more
in
it
than
you
think
you
would
believe
the
number
of
times
i
thought
of
my
young
days
since
i
been
home
it
as
though
some
one
was
always
shoving
them
up
in
front
of
my
face
all
i
want
you
know
is
to
be
jolly
to
let
other
people
alone
and
be
let
alone
myself
i
would
do
any
one
any
harm
in
the
world
i
would
really
but
it
as
though
father
wanted
me
to
believe
all
the
things
he
believes
so
that
he
could
believe
them
more
himself
perhaps
it
the
same
with
your
aunt
then
he
added
but
they
sick
people
that
explains
a
lot
sick
asked
maggie
yes
my
governor
got
heart
awfully
bad
he
might
go
off
at
any
moment
if
he
had
a
shock
and
your
aunt
do
you
know
no
said
maggie
cancer
they
all
say
so
i
thought
you
have
known
oh
maggie
drew
in
her
breath
she
shuddered
poor
aunt
anne
oh
poor
aunt
anne
i
did
know
she
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
confused
emotion
a
love
for
her
aunt
desire
to
help
her
and
at
the
same
time
shrinking
as
though
she
saw
the
whole
house
which
had
been
from
the
first
unhappy
to
her
was
now
diseased
and
evil
and
rotten
the
hot
life
in
her
body
told
her
against
her
moral
will
that
she
must
escape
and
her
soul
moving
in
her
and
speaking
to
her
told
her
that
now
more
than
ever
she
must
stay
oh
poor
poor
aunt
anne
she
said
again
he
moved
and
put
his
arm
around
her
he
had
meant
it
simply
as
a
movement
of
sympathy
and
protection
but
when
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
body
against
his
when
he
realised
how
she
went
to
him
at
once
with
the
confidence
and
simplicity
of
a
child
when
he
felt
the
hot
irregular
beat
of
her
heart
his
own
heart
leapt
his
arm
was
strengthened
like
a
barrier
of
iron
against
the
world
he
had
one
moment
of
desperate
resistance
a
voice
of
protest
calling
to
him
far
far
away
his
hand
touched
her
neck
he
raised
her
face
to
his
and
kissed
her
once
gently
kindly
then
passionately
again
and
again
she
shivered
a
little
as
though
surrendering
something
to
him
then
lay
quite
still
in
his
arms
maggie
maggie
he
whispered
then
she
raised
her
head
and
herself
kissed
him
there
was
a
noise
on
the
door
they
separated
the
door
opened
and
in
the
sudden
light
a
figure
was
visible
holding
a
glass
for
a
blind
instant
maggie
returning
from
her
other
world
thought
it
the
figure
of
palmer
of
rugeley
it
was
of
course
uncle
mathew
chapter
iv
crashaw
uncle
mathew
saw
maggie
back
to
her
door
kissed
her
and
left
her
on
their
way
home
he
did
not
once
mention
martin
warlock
to
her
he
left
her
as
he
heard
the
bolt
turn
in
the
door
hurrying
away
as
though
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
maggie
went
in
to
find
old
martha
with
her
crabbed
face
watching
her
sourly
but
she
did
not
care
nothing
could
touch
her
now
even
the
old
woman
cross
with
waiting
by
the
fading
kitchen
fire
noticed
the
light
in
the
girl
eyes
she
had
always
thought
the
girl
hard
and
ungracious
but
now
that
face
was
soft
and
the
mouth
smiling
over
its
secret
thoughts
and
the
eyes
sleepy
with
happiness
maggie
could
have
said
i
wild
with
joy
martha
i
know
what
love
is
i
had
never
thought
that
it
could
be
like
this
be
kind
to
me
because
it
the
greatest
night
of
my
life
martha
said
there
some
milk
hotted
for
you
miss
and
some
biscuits
there
on
the
table
by
the
stairs
oh
i
do
want
anything
martha
thank
you
your
aunt
said
you
was
to
have
it
maggie
drank
it
down
martha
watching
her
then
she
went
upstairs
softly
as
though
her
joy
might
awaken
the
whole
house
she
lay
on
her
bed
for
hours
then
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
deep
without
dreams
when
in
the
quieter
light
of
the
morning
she
considered
the
event
she
had
no
doubts
nor
hesitations
she
loved
martin
and
martin
loved
her
soon
martin
would
marry
her
and
they
would
go
away
her
aunt
would
be
sorry
of
course
and
his
father
perhaps
would
be
angry
but
the
sorrow
and
anger
would
be
only
for
a
little
while
then
martin
and
she
would
live
happily
together
always
happily
because
they
were
both
sensible
people
and
her
own
standard
of
fidelity
and
trust
was
she
supposed
also
his
she
did
not
think
very
deeply
about
what
he
had
said
to
her
it
only
meant
that
he
wanted
to
escape
from
his
family
a
desire
in
which
she
could
completely
sympathise
she
had
loved
him
as
she
now
saw
from
the
first
moment
of
meeting
and
she
would
love
him
always
she
would
never
be
alone
again
and
although
martin
had
told
her
that
he
was
weak
and
she
knew
something
about
men
she
was
aware
that
their
love
for
one
another
would
be
a
thing
apart
constant
unfaltering
eternal
she
had
read
no
modern
fiction
she
knew
nothing
about
psychology
she
was
absolutely
happy
and
then
in
that
very
first
day
she
discovered
that
life
was
not
quite
so
simple
in
the
first
place
she
wanted
martin
desperately
and
he
did
not
come
and
although
she
had
at
once
a
thousand
sensible
reasons
for
the
impossibility
of
his
coming
nevertheless
strange
new
troubles
and
suspicions
that
she
had
never
known
before
rose
in
her
heart
she
had
only
kissed
him
once
he
had
only
held
her
in
his
arms
for
a
few
moments
she
waited
looking
from
behind
the
curtains
out
into
the
street
how
could
he
let
the
whole
day
go
by
he
was
prevented
perhaps
by
that
horrible
sister
of
his
when
the
dusk
came
and
the
went
ringing
his
bell
down
the
street
she
felt
exhausted
as
though
she
had
been
running
for
miles
then
with
sudden
guilty
realisation
of
the
absorption
that
had
held
her
all
day
she
wondered
how
much
her
aunt
had
noticed
during
the
afternoon
when
she
had
been
watching
the
streets
from
behind
the
curtain
aunt
elizabeth
had
sat
sewing
thomas
the
cat
lumped
before
the
fire
the
whole
room
bathed
in
afternoon
silence
maggie
had
watched
as
though
hypnotized
by
the
street
itself
marking
the
long
squares
of
light
the
pools
of
shadow
the
the
at
the
corner
the
little
grocer
shop
with
cases
of
oranges
piled
outside
the
door
the
windows
on
the
second
floor
of
the
dressmaker
through
which
you
could
see
a
and
a
young
woman
with
a
pale
face
and
shiny
black
hair
who
came
and
glanced
out
once
and
again
as
though
to
reassure
herself
that
the
gay
world
was
still
there
the
people
the
horses
and
carts
the
cabs
went
on
their
way
often
it
seemed
that
this
figure
must
be
martin
now
this
now
this
and
on
every
occasion
maggie
heart
rose
in
her
breast
hammered
at
her
eyes
then
sank
again
over
and
over
she
told
to
herself
every
incident
of
yesterday
meeting
always
it
ended
in
that
same
wonderful
climax
when
she
was
caught
to
his
breast
and
felt
his
hand
at
her
neck
and
then
his
mouth
upon
hers
she
could
still
feel
against
her
skin
the
rough
warm
stuff
of
his
coat
and
the
soft
roughness
of
his
cheek
and
the
stiff
roughness
of
his
hair
she
could
still
feel
how
his
mouth
had
just
touched
hers
and
then
suddenly
gripped
it
as
though
it
would
never
let
it
go
then
she
had
been
absorbed
by
him
into
his
very
heart
so
that
still
now
she
felt
as
though
with
his
strong
arms
and
his
hard
firm
body
he
was
around
her
and
about
her
oh
she
loved
him
she
loved
him
but
why
did
he
not
come
had
he
been
able
only
to
pass
down
the
street
and
smile
up
to
her
window
as
he
went
that
would
have
been
something
it
would
at
least
have
reassured
her
that
yesterday
was
not
a
dream
an
invention
and
that
he
was
still
there
and
thought
of
her
and
cared
for
her
she
pulled
herself
together
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
she
came
back
into
her
proper
world
she
would
be
patient
as
she
had
once
resolved
outside
borhedden
farm
so
now
she
swore
that
she
would
owe
nothing
to
any
man
if
she
should
love
martin
warlock
it
would
not
be
for
anything
that
she
expected
to
get
from
him
but
only
for
the
love
that
she
had
it
in
her
to
give
if
good
came
of
it
well
if
not
she
was
still
her
own
master
but
more
than
ever
now
was
it
impossible
to
be
open
with
her
aunts
how
strange
it
was
that
from
the
very
beginning
there
had
been
concealments
between
aunt
anne
and
herself
perhaps
if
they
had
been
open
to
one
another
at
the
first
all
would
have
been
well
now
it
was
too
late
tea
came
in
and
with
tea
aunt
anne
it
was
the
first
time
that
day
that
maggie
had
seen
her
and
now
conscious
of
the
news
that
martin
had
given
her
she
felt
a
movement
of
sympathy
of
pity
and
affection
aunt
anne
had
been
in
her
room
all
day
and
she
seemed
as
she
walked
slowly
to
the
fire
to
be
of
a
finer
pallor
a
more
slender
body
than
ever
maggie
felt
as
though
she
could
see
the
firelight
through
her
body
and
with
that
came
also
the
conviction
that
aunt
anne
knew
everything
knew
about
martin
and
the
posted
letter
and
the
thoughts
of
escape
maggie
herself
was
tired
with
the
trial
of
her
waiting
day
she
was
exhausted
and
was
beating
with
all
her
resolve
against
a
disappointment
that
hammered
with
a
thundering
noise
somewhere
far
away
in
the
recesses
of
her
soul
so
they
all
drew
around
the
fire
and
had
their
tea
aunt
anne
leaning
back
in
her
chair
her
beautiful
hands
stretched
out
on
the
arms
a
fine
white
shawl
spread
on
her
knees
asked
maggie
about
last
night
i
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
dear
very
much
aunt
anne
uncle
mathew
was
very
kind
what
did
you
do
maggie
flushed
it
was
deceit
and
lies
now
all
the
time
and
oh
how
she
hated
lies
but
she
went
on
do
you
know
aunt
anne
i
think
uncle
mathew
is
so
changed
younger
and
everything
he
talked
quite
differently
last
night
about
his
business
and
all
that
he
doing
he
got
his
money
in
malt
now
he
says
whose
money
asked
aunt
anne
his
own
he
says
i
never
knew
he
had
any
but
he
says
yes
it
in
malt
it
not
a
nice
hotel
though
where
he
lives
not
nice
dear
no
i
did
like
it
but
it
only
for
men
really
of
course
i
think
he
better
take
you
somewhere
else
next
time
i
speak
to
him
by
the
way
maggie
dear
martha
tells
me
you
went
out
yesterday
afternoon
all
alone
into
the
strand
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
were
to
tell
us
maggie
cheeks
were
hot
she
set
back
her
shoulders
how
does
martha
know
she
asked
quickly
i
only
went
for
a
moment
only
for
a
little
walk
but
i
grown
up
aunt
anne
surely
i
can
go
out
by
myself
if
she
stopped
looking
away
from
them
into
the
fire
it
is
that
dear
aunt
anne
said
very
gently
it
only
that
you
been
so
little
a
time
in
london
that
you
ca
know
your
way
about
yet
and
london
a
strange
place
it
might
be
unpleasant
for
you
alone
i
rather
that
you
told
us
first
then
maggie
delivered
her
challenge
but
aunt
i
wo
be
always
here
i
going
off
to
earn
my
living
soon
are
i
aunt
elizabeth
drew
her
breath
in
sharply
aunt
anne
said
quietly
you
are
free
dear
quite
free
but
whilst
i
am
not
quite
myself
i
do
want
to
be
selfish
dear
but
you
are
a
great
comfort
to
us
and
when
i
am
stronger
certainly
you
shall
go
even
now
if
you
wish
of
course
but
my
illness
even
as
she
spoke
and
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
mentioned
her
illness
she
caught
at
her
breast
and
pressed
her
hand
there
as
though
she
were
in
great
pain
maggie
sprang
to
her
side
she
caught
the
girl
hand
with
hers
and
held
her
maggie
could
feel
her
swift
agonized
breathing
then
with
a
little
sigh
the
moment
had
passed
maggie
still
knelt
there
looking
up
into
her
aunt
face
martha
voice
was
heard
at
the
door
martin
warlock
miss
could
you
see
him
yes
martha
said
aunt
anne
her
voice
calm
and
controlled
ask
him
to
come
up
she
had
abandoned
so
completely
any
idea
that
he
might
still
come
that
she
could
not
now
feel
that
it
was
he
she
withdrew
from
her
side
and
stood
in
the
shadow
against
the
wall
although
her
heart
beat
wildly
her
whole
mind
was
bent
upon
composure
upon
showing
nothing
to
her
aunts
and
on
behaving
to
him
as
though
she
scarcely
knew
him
but
so
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
some
voice
cried
in
her
he
is
mine
he
is
mine
she
did
not
stir
from
her
wall
but
her
eyes
fastened
upon
him
and
then
did
not
move
he
was
wearing
the
same
clothes
as
yesterday
his
tie
was
different
it
had
been
black
and
now
it
was
dark
blue
he
looked
quiet
and
and
at
his
ease
his
rough
stiff
hair
was
carelessly
brushed
as
always
shone
from
his
eyes
he
smiled
his
walk
had
the
sturdy
broad
strength
of
a
man
who
is
absolutely
sure
of
himself
but
is
not
conceited
he
seemed
to
have
no
trouble
in
the
world
he
greeted
the
aunts
then
shook
hands
with
maggie
he
gave
her
one
glance
and
she
suddenly
feeling
that
that
glance
had
not
the
things
in
it
that
she
had
wanted
was
frightened
her
confidence
left
her
she
felt
that
if
she
did
not
have
a
word
alone
with
him
she
would
die
he
sat
down
near
aunt
anne
no
thank
you
i
wo
have
any
tea
he
said
we
dining
very
early
because
father
and
amy
have
a
meeting
right
away
over
golders
green
way
somewhere
it
really
on
a
message
from
him
that
i
came
he
did
not
look
at
her
placed
like
a
square
shadow
against
the
dusky
wall
he
sat
leaning
forward
a
little
his
hand
on
his
knee
his
leg
bulging
under
the
cloth
of
his
trouser
his
neck
struggling
behind
his
collar
but
his
smile
was
pleasant
and
easy
he
seemed
perfectly
at
home
my
father
wonders
whether
you
will
mind
some
friends
of
miss
avies
sitting
with
you
in
your
pew
evening
she
has
especially
asked
two
of
them
ladies
i
believe
but
it
seems
that
there
will
be
something
of
a
crowd
and
as
your
pew
is
always
half
empty
he
would
not
have
asked
except
that
there
seems
nowhere
else
aunt
anne
graciously
assented
but
of
course
warlock
maggie
will
be
going
with
us
but
still
there
will
be
room
crashaw
is
going
to
speak
after
all
i
hear
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
have
been
too
martin
laughed
he
is
staying
with
us
you
know
and
already
he
is
preparing
himself
he
about
the
oldest
human
being
i
ever
seen
he
must
be
a
hundred
he
a
great
saint
said
aunt
anne
he
always
in
a
terrible
temper
though
said
martin
he
mutters
to
himself
and
he
eats
nothing
his
room
is
next
to
mine
and
he
walked
up
and
down
all
night
talking
i
do
know
how
he
keeps
alive
perhaps
aunt
anne
thought
martin
tone
irreverent
she
relapsed
into
herself
and
seemed
suddenly
with
a
spiritual
wave
of
the
hand
to
have
dismissed
the
whole
company
martin
took
his
leave
he
barely
touched
maggie
hand
but
his
eyes
leapt
upon
hers
with
all
the
fire
of
a
greeting
too
long
delayed
his
lips
did
not
move
but
she
heard
the
whisper
soon
then
he
was
gone
soon
she
felt
as
though
she
could
not
wait
another
instant
but
must
immediately
run
after
him
follow
him
into
the
street
and
make
clear
his
plans
both
for
himself
and
her
then
continuing
her
struggle
of
the
long
day
she
beat
into
herself
endurance
she
was
in
a
new
world
in
a
world
with
roads
and
cities
mountains
rivers
seas
and
forests
that
had
to
be
traversed
by
her
to
be
learnt
and
remembered
and
conquered
and
for
the
success
of
this
she
must
have
her
own
spirit
absolutely
aloof
and
firm
and
brave
she
loved
him
that
must
be
enough
for
her
and
meanwhile
she
need
not
lose
her
common
sense
and
vision
of
everyday
life
but
meanwhile
it
hurt
she
was
now
twice
as
lonely
as
she
had
been
before
because
she
did
not
know
what
he
intended
to
do
and
always
with
her
now
there
was
something
strange
and
unknown
that
might
at
any
moment
be
stronger
than
she
but
by
next
morning
she
had
conquered
herself
she
would
see
him
at
chapel
that
night
and
perhaps
have
a
word
with
him
and
so
already
she
had
arrived
at
her
now
lover
calendar
of
dates
and
seasons
there
was
the
time
before
she
would
see
him
and
the
time
after
no
other
time
than
that
the
trouble
that
weighed
upon
her
most
heavily
was
her
deceitfulness
to
the
aunts
fifty
times
that
day
she
was
on
the
edge
of
speaking
and
telling
them
all
but
she
was
held
back
by
the
vagueness
of
her
relations
to
martin
were
they
engaged
did
he
even
love
her
he
had
only
kissed
her
he
had
said
nothing
no
she
must
wait
but
with
this
definite
sense
of
her
wickedness
weighing
upon
her
not
wickedness
to
herself
for
that
she
cared
nothing
but
wickedness
to
them
she
tried
on
this
day
to
be
a
pattern
member
of
the
household
going
softly
everywhere
that
she
was
told
closing
doors
behind
her
being
punctual
and
careful
unhappily
it
was
a
day
of
misfortune
it
was
one
of
aunt
anne
more
worldly
hours
and
she
thought
that
she
would
spend
it
in
training
maggie
very
good
but
maggie
dropped
a
glass
into
which
flowers
were
to
have
been
put
she
shook
her
pen
when
she
was
addressing
some
envelopes
so
that
some
drops
of
ink
were
scattered
upon
the
carpet
and
in
her
haste
to
be
punctual
she
banged
her
bedroom
door
so
loudly
that
aunt
anne
was
waked
from
her
afternoon
nap
a
scene
followed
aunt
anne
showed
herself
very
human
like
any
other
aunt
justly
exasperated
by
any
other
niece
i
sometimes
despair
of
you
maggie
you
will
not
think
of
others
i
do
wish
to
be
hard
or
unjust
but
selfishness
is
the
name
of
your
greatest
weakness
maggie
standing
with
her
hands
behind
her
a
spot
of
ink
on
her
nose
and
her
short
hair
ruffled
was
hard
and
unrepentant
you
must
send
me
away
she
said
i
not
a
success
here
you
like
me
aunt
anne
looked
at
maggie
with
eyes
that
were
clear
and
cold
like
deep
unfriendly
waters
you
must
say
that
we
love
you
but
you
have
very
much
to
learn
i
shall
speak
to
miss
avies
and
arrange
that
you
go
to
have
a
talk
with
her
sometimes
she
is
a
wise
woman
who
knows
many
things
my
sister
and
i
are
not
strong
enough
to
deal
with
you
and
we
are
weakened
perhaps
by
our
love
for
you
i
do
want
to
go
maggie
said
then
she
burst
out
oh
ca
i
lead
an
ordinary
life
like
other
girls
be
free
and
find
things
out
for
myself
not
only
go
by
what
older
people
tell
me
earn
my
living
and
be
free
i
never
lived
an
ordinary
life
life
with
father
was
fair
and
now
aunt
anne
put
out
her
arm
and
drew
her
towards
her
poor
maggie
are
you
unfair
to
us
do
you
suppose
really
that
we
do
love
you
do
you
think
that
i
do
understand
you
shall
be
free
afterwards
if
you
wish
perfectly
free
but
you
must
have
the
opportunity
of
learning
what
this
life
is
first
what
the
love
of
god
is
what
the
companionship
of
him
is
if
after
you
have
seen
you
still
reject
it
we
will
not
try
to
keep
you
but
it
is
god
will
that
you
stay
with
us
for
a
time
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
god
will
asked
maggie
melted
nevertheless
as
she
always
was
by
any
sign
of
affection
he
has
told
me
aunt
anne
answered
and
then
closed
her
eyes
maggie
went
away
with
a
sensation
of
being
tracked
by
some
stealthy
mysterious
force
that
was
creeping
ever
closer
and
closer
upon
her
that
she
could
only
feel
but
not
see
for
instance
she
might
have
said
that
she
would
not
go
to
chapel
and
she
might
have
taken
her
stand
upon
that
and
yet
she
could
not
say
that
of
course
she
must
go
because
she
must
see
martin
but
even
if
she
had
known
that
he
would
not
be
there
she
would
have
gone
was
it
curiosity
was
it
reminiscence
was
it
superstition
was
it
cowardice
was
it
loneliness
all
these
things
perhaps
and
yet
something
more
than
they
all
through
the
afternoon
of
the
lovely
november
day
she
anticipated
that
evening
services
as
though
it
were
in
some
way
to
be
a
climax
she
knew
that
it
was
to
be
for
all
of
them
an
especial
affair
she
had
heard
during
the
last
days
much
discussion
of
old
crashaw
he
was
an
old
man
with
apparently
a
wonderful
history
of
conversions
behind
him
his
conversions
had
been
it
seemed
of
the
forcible
kind
seizing
people
by
the
neck
and
shoving
them
in
he
was
a
fierce
and
militant
kind
of
saint
he
believed
it
seemed
in
damnation
and
eternal
hell
fire
and
could
make
you
believe
in
them
too
his
accent
was
on
the
tortures
rather
than
the
triumphs
of
religion
but
maggie
had
other
thoughts
in
this
outside
crashaw
she
had
never
lost
the
force
of
that
first
meeting
with
warlock
she
had
avoided
him
simply
because
she
was
afraid
lest
he
should
influence
her
too
much
but
now
after
her
friendship
with
martin
she
felt
that
she
could
never
meet
old
warlock
frankly
again
what
he
would
say
to
her
if
he
knew
that
she
meant
to
take
his
son
away
from
him
she
knew
well
enough
on
every
side
there
was
trouble
and
difficulty
she
could
not
see
a
friend
anywhere
unless
it
was
caroline
whom
she
did
not
completely
trust
and
magnus
whom
her
deception
of
her
aunt
would
she
knew
most
deeply
distress
meanwhile
she
was
being
pushed
forward
more
and
more
into
the
especial
religious
atmosphere
of
the
house
the
chapel
and
the
chapel
sect
of
no
use
to
tell
herself
that
this
was
only
a
tiny
fragment
of
the
whole
world
that
there
only
five
yards
away
from
her
in
the
strand
was
a
life
that
swept
past
the
chapel
and
its
worshippers
with
the
utmost
completest
indifference
she
had
always
this
feeling
that
she
was
caught
that
she
could
only
escape
by
a
desperate
violent
effort
that
would
hurt
others
and
perhaps
be
for
herself
a
lasting
reproach
she
wanted
so
simple
a
thing
to
be
always
with
martin
working
with
all
this
confusing
baffling
mysterious
religion
behind
her
this
simple
thing
seemed
incredibly
difficult
of
attainment
nevertheless
when
they
started
that
evening
for
the
chapel
she
felt
in
spite
of
herself
a
strange
almost
pleasurable
excitement
there
was
in
that
plain
ugly
building
some
force
that
could
not
be
denied
was
it
the
force
of
the
worshippers
belief
was
it
the
force
of
some
outside
power
that
watched
ironically
the
efforts
of
those
poor
human
beings
to
discover
it
was
it
the
love
of
a
father
for
his
children
no
there
was
very
little
love
in
this
creed
no
more
than
there
had
been
in
her
father
creed
before
as
she
walked
along
between
her
aunts
her
brain
was
a
curious
jumble
of
religion
martin
and
how
she
was
ever
going
to
learn
to
be
tidy
and
punctual
well
i
wo
care
was
the
resolution
with
which
she
always
brought
to
an
end
her
discussions
and
misgivings
i
myself
nobody
can
touch
me
unless
i
let
them
it
was
a
most
lovely
evening
very
pale
and
clear
with
an
orange
light
in
the
sky
like
the
reflection
of
some
far
distant
towering
fire
the
air
was
still
and
the
rumble
of
the
town
scarcely
penetrated
into
their
street
they
could
hear
the
ugly
voice
of
the
little
chapel
bell
jangling
in
the
heart
of
the
houses
there
was
a
scent
of
chrysanthemums
from
somewhere
and
a
very
faint
suggestion
of
snow
even
before
they
reached
the
chapel
door
a
few
flakes
lazily
began
to
fall
maggie
was
thinking
now
only
of
martin
there
was
a
already
lighted
in
the
chapel
doorway
and
this
blinded
her
eyes
she
had
hoped
that
he
would
be
there
waiting
so
that
he
might
have
a
word
with
her
before
they
went
in
but
when
they
were
all
gathered
together
under
the
porch
she
saw
with
a
throb
of
disappointment
that
he
was
not
there
she
saw
no
one
whom
she
knew
but
it
struck
her
at
once
that
here
was
a
gathering
quite
different
from
that
of
the
first
time
that
she
had
come
to
the
chapel
there
seemed
to
be
more
of
the
servant
class
rather
they
were
older
women
with
serious
rapt
expressions
and
very
silent
there
were
men
too
four
or
five
gathered
together
inside
the
passage
standing
gravely
without
a
word
not
moving
like
statues
maggie
was
frightened
she
felt
like
a
spy
in
an
enemy
camp
and
a
spy
waiting
for
an
inevitable
detection
with
no
hope
of
securing
any
news
as
she
went
up
the
aisle
behind
her
aunts
her
eyes
searched
for
martin
she
could
not
see
him
their
seat
was
close
to
the
front
and
already
seated
in
it
were
the
austere
miss
avies
and
two
lady
friends
maggie
was
maliciously
pleased
to
observe
that
miss
avies
had
not
expected
these
additions
to
her
number
and
was
now
in
danger
of
an
uncomfortable
squashing
there
was
indeed
a
polite
little
struggle
between
miss
avies
and
aunt
anne
as
to
who
should
have
the
corner
with
a
wooden
arm
upon
which
to
rest
miss
avies
two
friends
huddled
and
frightened
like
fledglings
suddenly
surprised
by
a
cuckoo
stirred
maggie
sympathy
she
disliked
miss
avies
from
the
very
first
moment
miss
avies
had
a
pale
thin
pointed
face
with
no
eyebrows
grey
eyes
dim
and
and
fair
colourless
hair
brushed
straight
back
under
a
hard
ugly
black
hat
at
the
same
time
she
was
nervous
emotional
restless
something
about
her
was
always
moving
her
lips
her
hands
her
shoulders
her
eyes
she
was
fierce
and
hostile
and
ineffectual
one
felt
so
long
as
she
was
by
herself
maggie
did
not
of
course
notice
all
this
at
the
time
but
in
after
years
she
always
looked
back
on
the
pale
thin
miss
avies
as
the
motive
of
most
of
the
events
that
followed
this
particular
evening
it
was
as
though
she
felt
that
miss
avies
weight
not
enough
in
itself
to
effect
any
result
when
thrown
into
the
balance
just
turned
everything
in
one
direction
it
had
that
result
at
any
rate
upon
maggie
herself
she
soon
lost
however
consideration
of
miss
avies
in
the
wider
observation
of
the
chapel
and
its
congregation
it
was
as
it
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
visit
to
it
stuffy
smelling
of
gas
and
brick
and
painted
wood
ugly
in
its
bareness
and
unresponsiveness
and
nevertheless
exciting
the
interior
of
the
building
had
the
air
of
one
who
has
watched
some
most
unusual
happenings
and
expects
very
shortly
to
watch
them
again
even
the
harmonium
seemed
to
prick
up
its
wooden
ears
in
anticipation
and
the
congregation
thrilled
also
with
breathless
expectation
as
maggie
looked
round
upon
them
she
could
see
that
they
were
throbbing
with
the
anticipation
of
some
almost
sensuous
delight
by
now
they
had
filled
the
chapel
to
its
utmost
limits
but
there
was
not
one
human
being
there
who
did
not
seem
to
have
the
appearance
of
having
been
especially
selected
from
other
less
interesting
human
beings
it
was
not
that
the
forces
that
surrounded
her
were
especially
interesting
but
she
felt
that
all
of
them
had
taken
on
some
especial
dramatic
character
from
the
occasion
such
personalities
as
aunt
anne
and
miss
avies
were
in
any
case
vivid
and
dramatic
but
aunt
elizabeth
and
the
placidly
rotund
smith
who
was
sitting
in
the
front
row
with
her
mouth
open
and
simple
little
miss
pyncheon
aunt
anne
friend
were
remarkable
and
exceptional
then
suddenly
maggie
caught
sight
of
martin
he
was
sitting
in
the
extreme
right
next
the
wall
his
sister
was
next
to
him
maggie
could
only
see
his
head
and
shoulders
but
she
realised
at
once
that
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
trying
to
catch
her
eye
he
smiled
at
her
an
intimate
peculiar
smile
that
sent
the
blood
flooding
to
her
face
and
made
her
heart
beat
with
happiness
at
the
moment
of
her
smiling
she
realised
that
miss
avies
dim
eye
was
upon
her
what
right
had
miss
avies
to
watch
over
her
she
set
back
her
shoulders
sat
up
stiffly
and
tried
to
look
as
old
as
she
might
that
was
not
unhappily
very
old
that
smile
exchanged
with
martin
had
made
her
happy
for
ever
miss
avies
was
of
less
than
no
importance
at
all
the
little
bell
ceased
its
jangling
the
harmonium
began
a
quavering
prelude
and
from
a
door
at
the
back
behind
the
little
platform
and
desk
three
men
entered
first
thurston
then
a
little
crooked
man
who
must
maggie
knew
be
crashaw
finally
in
magnificent
contrast
warlock
a
quiver
of
emotion
passed
over
the
chapel
there
was
then
a
hushed
expectant
pause
brothers
and
sisters
let
us
pray
said
thurston
maggie
had
not
seen
him
before
she
wondered
what
strange
chance
had
led
him
and
warlock
to
work
together
in
every
movement
of
the
body
in
every
tone
of
the
voice
thurston
showed
the
professional
actor
his
thoughts
were
all
upon
himself
and
the
effect
that
he
was
making
so
calculated
was
he
in
his
attitude
that
his
eyes
betrayed
him
having
in
their
gleam
other
thoughts
other
intentions
very
far
away
from
his
immediate
business
in
the
chapel
maggie
watching
him
wondered
what
those
thoughts
were
his
voice
was
ugly
as
were
all
his
movements
his
sharp
actor
face
with
the
long
rather
dirty
black
hair
the
hooked
nose
the
long
dirty
fingers
which
moved
in
and
out
as
though
they
worked
of
themselves
all
these
things
were
false
and
unmoving
but
behind
his
harsh
voice
gross
accent
and
melodramatic
tone
there
was
some
power
the
power
of
a
man
ambitious
ruthless
scornful
he
did
not
care
a
snap
of
his
fingers
for
his
congregation
he
laughed
at
their
beliefs
he
made
use
of
their
credulity
oh
god
he
prayed
his
voice
now
shrill
and
quivering
and
just
out
of
tune
so
that
it
jarred
every
nerve
in
maggie
body
thou
seest
what
we
are
miserable
sinners
not
worthy
of
thy
care
or
goodness
sunk
deep
in
the
mire
of
evil
living
and
evil
nevertheless
oh
god
we
knowing
thy
loving
towards
thy
sinful
servants
do
pray
thee
that
thou
wilt
give
us
thy
blessing
before
we
leave
this
thy
this
night
a
new
contrite
is
what
we
beg
of
thee
that
we
may
go
out
into
this
evil
world
taught
by
thee
to
search
out
our
ways
and
improve
our
thoughts
caring
for
nothing
but
thee
following
in
thy
footsteps
and
making
ready
for
thy
immediate
coming
which
will
be
in
thine
own
good
time
and
according
to
thy
will
this
we
pray
for
the
sake
of
thy
dear
son
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
died
for
our
sins
upon
the
bloody
cross
amen
from
between
her
hands
maggie
watched
those
two
strange
eyes
wandering
about
the
chapel
picking
up
here
a
person
there
a
person
wondering
over
this
wondering
over
that
and
always
in
the
end
concerned
not
about
these
things
at
all
but
about
some
other
more
ultimate
loneliness
fear
or
expectation
something
that
set
him
apart
and
made
him
as
are
all
men
in
the
final
recesses
of
their
spirit
as
lonely
as
though
he
were
by
himself
on
a
desert
island
the
thrill
of
anticipation
faded
through
the
chapel
as
thurston
continued
his
prayer
he
had
not
at
any
rate
power
over
his
audience
the
thing
that
they
were
waiting
for
was
something
that
he
could
not
satisfy
a
restlessness
was
abroad
coughing
broke
out
once
twice
then
everywhere
chairs
creaked
sighs
could
be
heard
some
one
moved
to
the
door
thurston
seemed
to
realise
his
failure
with
a
sudden
snap
of
impatience
he
brought
prayer
to
an
end
and
rose
to
his
feet
we
will
sing
he
said
no
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
the
singing
of
the
hymn
roused
the
excitement
of
the
congregation
to
even
more
than
its
earlier
pitch
the
tune
was
a
moving
one
beginning
very
softly
beseeching
god
to
listen
then
more
confident
rising
to
a
high
note
of
appeal
by
all
thy
sores
and
bloody
pain
come
down
and
heal
our
sins
again
falling
after
that
to
a
note
of
confidence
and
security
in
the
last
refrain
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
we
beseech
thee
in
spite
of
the
crudity
of
the
words
and
the
simplicity
of
the
tune
maggie
had
tears
in
her
eyes
the
whole
chapel
was
singing
now
singing
as
though
the
sins
of
the
world
could
be
redeemed
only
by
the
force
and
power
of
this
especial
moment
maggie
was
caught
up
with
the
rest
she
found
herself
singing
parts
of
the
second
verse
then
in
the
third
she
was
carried
away
had
forgotten
herself
her
surroundings
even
martin
there
was
something
real
in
this
something
beyond
the
ugliness
of
the
chapel
and
its
congregation
she
remembered
what
magnus
had
said
if
there
something
of
great
value
do
think
the
less
of
it
because
the
people
including
yourself
who
admire
it
are
worth
very
much
why
should
they
be
she
looked
for
a
moment
at
aunt
anne
and
saw
her
in
an
ecstasy
singing
in
her
cracked
tuneless
voice
a
smile
about
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
that
gazed
far
far
beyond
that
chapel
maggie
felt
the
approach
of
tears
she
stopped
singing
softly
the
refrain
of
the
last
verse
came
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
we
beseech
thee
the
hymn
over
warlock
read
the
bible
and
then
offered
up
a
long
extempore
prayer
strangely
enough
warlock
brought
maggie
back
to
reality
strangely
because
on
an
earlier
occasion
he
had
done
exactly
the
opposite
she
realised
at
once
that
he
was
not
happy
before
he
had
been
himself
caught
up
into
the
mood
that
held
the
chapel
he
was
fighting
against
a
mood
that
was
then
outside
him
a
mood
with
which
he
did
not
sympathise
and
in
which
he
could
not
believe
she
saw
that
he
was
unhappy
he
spoke
slowly
without
the
spontaneity
and
force
that
he
had
used
before
once
he
made
a
long
pause
and
you
could
feel
throughout
the
chapel
a
wave
of
nervous
apprehension
as
though
every
one
were
waiting
to
see
whether
he
would
fight
his
way
through
or
not
maggie
felt
her
earlier
emotion
sentimental
and
false
it
was
as
though
he
had
said
to
her
but
that
not
the
true
thing
that
cheap
sham
emotion
that
what
they
trying
to
turn
our
great
reality
into
i
fighting
them
and
you
must
help
me
he
was
fighting
them
she
could
imagine
thurston
scornful
lip
hidden
now
by
his
hands
as
warlock
went
on
with
his
dignified
sentences
his
restraint
and
his
reverence
she
could
fancy
how
thurston
was
saying
to
himself
but
what
the
good
of
this
blood
and
thunder
we
want
the
old
feller
getting
past
his
work
he
must
go
but
it
was
warlock
reality
of
which
she
was
afraid
as
he
continued
his
prayer
she
felt
all
her
old
terror
return
that
terror
that
she
had
known
on
the
night
her
father
died
during
the
hours
that
she
had
watched
beside
his
dead
body
at
the
moment
when
she
had
first
arrived
at
the
house
in
london
during
her
first
visit
to
the
chapel
when
she
had
said
to
her
aunt
before
going
out
with
uncle
mathew
and
now
warlock
was
sweeping
her
still
farther
inside
the
intensity
of
his
belief
forced
hers
there
was
something
real
in
this
power
of
god
and
you
could
not
finish
with
it
simply
by
disregarding
it
she
felt
as
she
had
felt
so
often
lately
that
some
one
was
suddenly
going
to
rise
and
demand
some
oath
or
promise
from
her
that
she
in
her
panic
would
give
her
word
and
then
would
be
caught
for
ever
by
the
love
of
thy
dear
son
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
the
promise
of
thy
second
coming
we
beseech
thee
finished
warlock
during
all
this
time
the
atmosphere
of
the
chapel
had
been
growing
hotter
and
hotter
and
closer
and
closer
it
had
always
its
air
of
being
buried
deep
under
ground
bathed
in
a
kind
of
sunken
heat
that
found
its
voice
in
the
gas
that
hissed
and
sizzled
overhead
near
the
door
was
a
long
rail
on
which
coats
might
be
hung
and
now
these
garments
could
be
seen
swaying
a
little
to
and
fro
like
corpses
of
condemned
men
the
bare
ugliness
of
the
building
with
its
stone
walls
its
rows
of
wooden
seats
its
grey
windows
its
its
ugly
desk
and
platform
was
veiled
now
in
a
thin
steaming
heat
that
rose
mistily
above
the
heads
of
the
kneeling
congregation
and
seemed
to
hide
strange
shapes
and
shadows
in
its
shifting
depths
every
one
was
swimming
in
an
uncertain
world
the
unreality
grew
with
the
heat
maggie
herself
at
the
end
of
warlock
prayer
felt
that
her
test
of
a
real
solid
and
unimaginative
world
was
leaving
her
she
was
expectant
like
the
rest
as
ready
to
believe
anything
at
all
out
of
the
mist
rose
crashaw
this
was
a
little
old
man
with
a
crabbed
face
and
a
body
that
seemed
to
have
endured
infernal
twistings
in
some
inquisitioner
maggie
learnt
afterwards
that
he
had
suffered
for
many
years
from
intolerable
rheumatism
but
the
contortions
and
windings
of
the
body
with
which
he
climbed
up
onto
the
platform
and
then
the
grimaces
that
he
made
as
his
large
round
head
peered
over
the
top
of
the
desk
might
have
struck
any
less
solemn
assemblage
as
farcical
he
wore
an
old
shiny
black
frock
coat
and
a
white
rather
grimy
tie
fastened
in
a
sharp
little
bow
his
face
was
lined
like
a
map
his
cheeks
seamed
and
furrowed
his
forehead
a
wilderness
of
marks
his
scanty
hair
brushed
straight
back
so
that
the
top
of
his
forehead
seemed
unnaturally
shiny
and
bald
his
hands
with
which
he
clutched
the
side
of
his
desk
were
brown
and
wrinkled
and
grasping
like
a
monkey
his
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
fanatic
but
they
were
not
steady
and
speculative
like
warlock
or
glowing
and
distant
like
aunt
anne
but
rather
angry
and
restless
and
pugnacious
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
madman
but
of
a
madman
who
can
yet
calculate
upon
and
arrange
his
position
in
the
world
he
was
mad
for
his
own
purposes
and
could
for
these
same
purposes
bind
his
madness
to
its
proper
bounds
he
seemed
to
maggie
at
first
rather
pathetic
with
his
little
twisted
body
and
his
large
round
head
very
soon
it
was
emotions
quite
other
than
pity
that
she
was
feeling
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
a
practised
preacher
and
she
who
had
with
the
exception
of
warlock
never
heard
a
fine
preacher
was
at
once
under
the
sway
of
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
dramatic
orators
of
his
time
his
voice
was
sweet
and
clear
and
seemed
strange
enough
coming
from
that
ugly
and
malevolent
countenance
only
the
head
and
the
grasping
hands
could
be
seen
but
sometimes
the
invisible
body
was
driven
with
such
force
against
the
desk
that
it
seemed
that
it
must
fling
the
thing
over
down
into
the
congregation
my
brothers
and
sisters
he
began
i
have
come
to
give
you
a
warning
and
this
warning
is
given
to
you
not
as
the
expression
of
a
personal
opinion
but
as
the
declaration
of
an
assumed
fact
disregard
it
or
not
as
you
please
but
i
shall
have
done
my
duty
in
pointing
out
to
you
the
sure
and
certain
meaning
of
my
message
i
a
sinner
like
the
rest
of
you
live
nevertheless
in
the
fear
of
hell
fire
hell
fire
has
become
i
think
to
many
of
the
present
generation
a
mockery
and
a
derision
i
come
to
tell
you
that
it
is
no
mockery
that
it
as
surely
lies
there
a
blazing
furnace
in
front
of
us
as
though
we
saw
it
with
our
own
eyes
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
surely
seen
it
they
were
fixed
now
in
a
frenzy
of
realisation
upon
some
distant
vision
and
with
a
shiver
the
chapel
followed
his
gaze
it
is
easy
enough
to
laugh
at
bare
and
conventional
words
stripped
of
the
atmosphere
and
significance
of
their
original
surroundings
the
merest
baby
in
this
twentieth
century
can
laugh
at
the
flames
of
hell
and
advance
a
string
of
easy
arguments
against
the
probability
of
any
such
melodramatic
fulfilment
of
the
commonplace
and
colourless
lives
that
the
majority
of
us
lead
but
maggie
was
in
no
mood
to
laugh
that
night
before
five
minutes
had
passed
she
found
herself
shivering
where
she
sat
the
chapel
was
convicted
of
sin
and
of
sin
of
no
ordinary
measure
the
head
that
rested
like
a
round
ball
on
the
surface
of
the
desk
thrust
conviction
into
every
heart
you
think
that
you
may
escape
you
look
at
your
neighbours
every
one
of
you
and
say
is
worse
than
i
am
safe
but
i
tell
you
that
not
one
man
or
woman
here
shall
be
secure
unless
he
turn
instantly
now
to
god
and
beg
for
mercy
as
he
continued
he
did
indeed
bear
the
almost
breathless
urgency
of
one
who
has
been
sent
on
in
advance
to
announce
the
imminence
of
some
awful
peril
no
matter
what
the
peril
might
be
simply
through
the
chapel
there
passed
the
breath
of
some
coming
danger
impossible
to
watch
him
and
not
realise
that
here
was
a
man
who
had
seen
something
with
his
own
eyes
that
had
changed
in
a
moment
the
very
fabric
of
his
life
thurston
might
be
a
charlatan
who
played
with
the
beliefs
of
his
dupes
warlock
might
be
a
mystic
whose
vision
was
in
the
future
and
not
in
the
past
crashaw
knew
he
painted
quietly
without
fine
words
but
with
assurance
and
conviction
his
belief
in
the
punishment
of
mankind
god
was
almost
now
upon
the
threshold
of
their
house
he
was
at
the
very
gates
of
their
city
and
with
him
was
coming
a
doom
as
sure
and
awful
as
the
sentence
of
the
earthly
judge
on
his
earthly
victim
punishment
punishment
we
have
grown
in
this
careless
age
to
laugh
at
punishment
a
future
life
there
is
no
future
life
god
there
is
no
god
even
were
he
to
come
upon
us
we
could
escape
from
him
we
could
make
a
very
good
case
for
ourselves
this
world
is
safe
secure
founded
upon
our
markets
our
treasuries
our
laws
and
commandments
our
conventions
of
decent
behaviour
our
police
and
our
ministers
god
can
not
touch
us
we
are
secure
i
tell
you
that
at
this
very
moment
this
earth
in
which
you
trust
is
trembling
under
you
at
this
instant
everything
in
which
you
believed
is
undermined
and
is
betraying
you
you
have
been
given
your
opportunity
you
are
refusing
it
and
god
is
upon
you
his
voice
changed
suddenly
to
tones
of
a
marvellous
sweetness
he
appealed
pleaded
implored
the
ugliness
of
his
face
and
body
was
forgotten
he
was
simply
a
voice
issuing
from
space
sent
to
save
a
world
and
we
here
the
few
of
us
out
of
this
huge
city
gathered
together
here
it
is
not
too
late
for
us
let
us
surrender
ourselves
let
us
go
to
him
and
say
that
we
are
his
that
we
await
his
coming
and
obey
his
law
brothers
and
sisters
i
am
as
you
are
weak
and
helpless
and
full
of
sin
but
come
to
him
come
to
him
come
to
him
there
is
help
for
us
all
help
and
pity
and
love
love
such
as
none
of
us
have
ever
known
love
that
can
not
fail
us
and
will
be
with
us
until
eternity
he
stepped
out
from
behind
the
desk
stood
before
them
all
with
his
little
stunted
twisted
body
his
arms
held
out
towards
them
there
followed
then
an
extraordinary
scene
from
all
over
the
chapel
came
sobs
and
cries
a
man
rose
suddenly
from
the
back
of
the
building
and
cried
aloud
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
one
of
the
women
who
had
come
with
miss
avies
fell
upon
her
knees
and
began
to
sob
crying
hysterically
oh
god
have
mercy
god
have
mercy
women
pressed
up
the
two
aisles
some
of
them
falling
on
their
knees
there
where
they
had
stood
others
coming
to
the
front
and
kneeling
there
somewhere
they
began
to
sing
the
hymn
that
had
already
been
sung
that
evening
a
few
voices
at
first
then
more
then
all
singing
together
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
we
beseech
thee
everywhere
now
women
were
crying
the
chapel
was
filled
with
voices
sobs
cries
and
prayers
crashaw
stood
there
motionless
his
arms
outstretched
maggie
did
not
know
what
she
felt
she
seemed
deprived
of
all
sensation
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
fear
and
excitement
both
joy
and
disgust
held
her
she
could
not
have
told
any
one
what
her
sensations
were
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
as
though
with
cold
but
behind
everything
she
had
this
terror
that
at
any
moment
she
might
be
drawn
forward
to
do
something
to
give
some
pledge
that
would
bind
her
for
all
her
life
she
felt
as
though
some
power
were
urging
her
to
this
and
as
though
the
chapel
and
every
one
in
it
was
conscious
of
the
struggle
what
might
have
happened
she
would
never
know
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
sleeve
and
turning
round
saw
aunt
anne
eyes
looking
up
at
her
out
of
a
face
that
was
so
white
and
the
skin
of
it
so
tightly
drawn
that
it
was
like
the
face
of
a
dead
woman
i
in
great
pain
maggie
i
think
you
must
take
me
home
she
heard
her
aunt
say
aunt
anne
took
her
arm
they
went
out
followed
by
aunt
elizabeth
the
fresh
evening
air
that
blew
upon
maggie
forehead
seemed
suddenly
to
make
of
the
chapel
a
dim
incredible
phantom
faintly
from
behind
the
closed
door
came
the
echo
of
the
hymn
the
street
was
absolutely
still
no
human
being
was
in
sight
only
an
old
cab
stationed
close
at
hand
waiting
for
a
possible
customer
into
this
they
got
the
pale
almost
white
evening
sky
with
stars
in
sheets
and
squares
and
pools
of
fire
shone
with
the
clear
radiance
of
glass
above
them
maggie
could
see
the
stars
through
the
dirty
windows
of
the
cab
they
were
quite
silent
all
the
way
home
aunt
anne
sitting
up
very
straight
motionless
her
fingers
still
on
maggie
arm
inside
the
house
there
was
jane
she
seemed
at
once
to
and
with
aunt
elizabeth
led
aunt
anne
up
the
dark
stairs
they
disappeared
leaving
maggie
alone
in
the
hall
whose
only
sound
was
the
ticking
clock
from
the
stairs
and
only
light
the
dim
lamp
above
the
door
chapter
v
the
choice
she
waited
for
some
time
alone
in
the
hall
listening
for
she
knew
not
what
her
departure
from
the
chapel
had
been
too
abrupt
to
allow
her
in
a
moment
to
shake
off
the
impression
of
it
above
all
the
impression
of
crashaw
standing
there
his
arms
stretched
out
to
her
his
eyes
burning
her
through
and
through
with
the
urgent
insistence
of
his
discovery
she
was
tired
her
head
ached
horribly
she
would
have
given
everything
at
that
moment
for
a
friend
who
would
care
for
her
and
protect
her
from
her
own
wild
fears
she
did
not
know
of
what
she
was
afraid
but
she
knew
that
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
do
anything
than
spend
the
night
in
that
house
and
yet
what
could
she
do
how
could
she
escape
she
knew
that
she
could
not
oh
if
only
martin
would
come
where
was
he
why
could
he
not
carry
her
off
that
very
night
why
did
he
not
come
she
gazed
desperately
about
her
could
she
not
leave
the
house
there
and
then
but
where
should
she
go
what
could
she
do
without
a
friend
in
london
she
stood
there
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
looking
up
at
the
black
stairs
listening
for
some
sound
from
above
fancying
a
ghost
in
every
darkening
corner
of
the
place
then
her
common
sense
reasserted
itself
it
was
something
at
any
rate
that
she
was
out
of
the
chapel
away
from
crashaw
piercing
eyes
thurston
rasping
voice
warlock
reproachful
melancholy
she
felt
this
evening
as
though
by
struggling
with
all
her
strength
she
could
shut
the
gates
upon
new
experiences
that
were
fighting
to
enter
into
her
soul
but
must
at
all
costs
to
her
own
happiness
be
defeated
no
such
thing
as
ghosts
no
such
thing
as
a
god
be
he
kind
tender
cruel
or
loving
nothing
but
what
one
can
see
can
touch
can
confront
with
one
physical
strength
she
had
been
to
a
service
at
a
methodist
chapel
her
aunt
had
been
ill
there
would
be
daylight
and
people
hurrying
down
the
street
about
their
business
work
and
shops
and
food
and
sun
no
such
thing
as
ghosts
nothing
but
what
you
can
see
and
i
get
some
work
without
wasting
a
minute
she
thought
nodding
her
head
in
a
shop
if
necessary
or
i
could
be
a
governess
and
then
when
he
is
free
martin
will
be
with
me
she
climbed
on
a
chair
and
turned
down
the
as
she
had
seen
martha
do
she
went
to
the
door
and
slipped
the
chain
into
its
socket
and
turned
the
lock
she
listened
for
a
moment
before
she
started
upstairs
she
saw
crashaw
eyes
in
the
dark
she
heard
his
voice
punishment
punishment
she
suddenly
started
to
run
up
the
black
stairs
stumbled
ran
faster
through
the
passage
under
the
picture
of
the
armed
men
arrived
at
last
in
her
room
breathless
during
her
undressing
she
stopped
sometimes
to
listen
her
bedroom
was
on
the
floor
below
hers
and
she
certainly
could
hear
nothing
through
the
closed
doors
and
yet
she
fancied
as
she
stood
there
that
the
sound
of
sobbing
came
up
to
her
and
twice
a
sharp
cry
i
suppose
i
terribly
selfish
she
thought
i
ought
to
want
to
go
and
help
aunt
anne
and
i
do
no
she
did
she
wanted
to
run
away
from
the
house
miles
and
miles
and
miles
she
climbed
into
bed
and
thought
of
her
escape
if
miss
trenchard
did
not
answer
her
letter
then
she
could
go
off
to
uncle
mathew
greatly
though
she
disliked
the
thought
of
that
then
she
could
live
on
her
three
hundred
pounds
and
look
about
until
she
found
work
or
martin
came
for
her
but
so
ignorant
was
she
of
the
world
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
she
could
get
her
three
hundred
pounds
but
uncle
mathew
would
know
she
thought
of
him
standing
in
the
doorway
at
the
hotel
holding
up
a
glass
then
she
thought
of
martin
and
so
fell
asleep
she
woke
suddenly
to
find
some
one
standing
in
her
open
doorway
and
holding
up
a
candle
that
some
one
was
old
martha
looking
strange
enough
in
a
nightdress
her
scanty
grey
hairs
untidily
about
her
neck
and
a
dirty
red
shawl
over
her
shoulders
maggie
blinked
at
the
light
and
sat
up
in
bed
what
is
it
she
asked
it
your
aunt
miss
miss
anne
she
very
bad
she
wants
you
to
go
to
her
maggie
got
out
of
bed
put
on
her
and
slippers
and
followed
the
servant
as
she
hurried
along
the
dark
passage
she
was
still
only
her
soul
had
not
returned
into
her
body
but
her
body
was
awake
and
vibrating
with
the
knowledge
that
the
soul
was
soon
coming
to
it
and
coming
to
it
with
great
news
with
the
consciousness
of
a
marvellous
experience
for
at
the
instant
when
martha
awoke
her
she
had
been
dreaming
of
martin
dreaming
of
him
physically
so
that
it
was
his
body
against
hers
his
hand
hot
and
dry
in
hers
cool
and
soft
his
cheek
rough
and
strong
against
hers
smooth
and
pale
there
had
been
no
sentimentality
or
weakness
in
her
dream
they
had
been
confident
and
sure
and
defiant
together
and
it
had
been
real
life
for
her
so
real
that
this
dream
life
in
which
now
she
moved
down
the
shadowy
passage
was
about
her
as
green
water
is
about
one
when
one
swims
under
waves
it
was
only
slowly
as
the
cold
air
of
the
house
at
night
cleared
her
eyes
and
her
throat
and
her
breast
that
she
came
to
the
world
consciousness
again
and
surrendered
her
lover
back
to
the
shades
and
felt
a
sudden
frightened
fear
lest
after
all
she
should
never
really
know
that
ecstasy
of
which
she
had
just
been
dreaming
nevertheless
it
was
still
with
a
great
consciousness
of
martin
that
she
entered
her
aunt
bedroom
before
she
entered
she
turned
round
for
a
moment
to
martha
what
must
i
do
she
asked
what
will
she
want
me
to
do
it
only
said
martha
if
the
pains
come
on
very
bad
to
give
her
some
drops
they
in
a
little
green
bottle
by
her
bed
five
drops
yes
miss
five
drops
in
a
little
green
bottle
only
if
the
pains
is
very
bad
she
brave
wonderful
i
sat
up
till
morning
willing
and
so
of
course
would
miss
elizabeth
but
she
seemed
to
want
you
miss
they
were
like
two
conspirators
whispering
there
in
the
dark
the
room
within
was
so
still
maggie
very
softly
pushed
back
the
door
and
entered
she
walked
a
few
steps
inside
the
room
and
hesitated
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
at
all
utter
stillness
so
that
maggie
could
hear
her
own
breathing
as
though
it
were
some
one
else
at
her
side
warning
her
then
slowly
things
emerged
the
long
white
bed
first
afterwards
a
shaded
lamp
beside
it
a
little
table
with
bottles
a
chair
beyond
the
circle
of
lighted
shadow
there
were
shapes
near
the
window
a
high
glass
a
dark
shade
that
was
the
and
faint
grey
squares
where
the
windows
hung
in
the
room
was
a
strange
scent
half
wine
half
medicine
and
beyond
that
the
plain
tang
of
apples
partially
eaten
a
little
smell
of
oil
too
from
the
lamp
very
faintly
the
figure
of
the
christ
above
the
bed
was
visible
maggie
moved
forward
to
the
bed
then
stopped
again
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
she
could
see
a
dark
shadow
on
the
pillow
that
must
she
knew
be
her
aunt
hair
and
yet
she
did
not
connect
that
with
her
aunt
the
room
was
cold
and
she
felt
of
infinite
space
the
smell
of
the
wine
and
the
medicine
made
her
shy
and
awkward
as
though
she
were
somewhere
where
she
should
not
be
there
came
a
little
sigh
and
then
a
very
quiet
tired
voice
maggie
is
that
you
yes
aunt
anne
she
came
very
close
to
the
bed
and
suddenly
as
though
a
curtain
had
been
drawn
back
she
could
see
her
aunt
large
eyes
and
white
sharp
face
it
was
very
good
of
you
dear
to
come
i
felt
ashamed
to
wake
you
up
at
such
an
hour
but
i
wanted
you
i
felt
that
only
you
must
be
with
me
it
was
a
call
from
god
i
felt
that
it
must
be
obeyed
sit
down
dear
there
on
that
chair
you
not
cold
are
you
maggie
sat
down
gathering
her
close
about
her
she
was
not
even
now
drawn
right
out
of
her
dream
and
the
room
seemed
fantastic
to
rise
and
fall
a
little
and
to
be
filled
with
sound
just
out
of
hearing
for
a
time
she
was
so
sleepy
that
she
nodded
on
her
chair
and
the
green
lamp
swelled
and
quivered
and
the
very
bed
seemed
to
sway
in
the
dark
but
soon
the
cold
air
cleared
her
head
and
she
was
wide
awake
staring
before
her
at
the
grey
her
aunt
did
not
for
a
long
time
speak
again
maggie
sat
there
her
mind
a
maze
of
the
chapel
old
crashaw
miss
avies
and
martin
slowly
the
cold
crept
into
her
feet
and
her
hands
but
her
head
now
was
burning
hot
then
suddenly
her
aunt
began
to
talk
in
a
dreamy
rather
lazy
voice
not
her
natural
daily
tone
which
was
always
very
sharp
and
clear
she
talked
on
and
on
sometimes
her
sentences
were
confused
and
unfinished
sometimes
they
seemed
to
maggie
to
have
no
meaning
once
or
twice
the
voice
dropped
so
low
that
maggie
did
not
catch
the
words
but
always
there
was
especial
urgency
behind
the
carelessness
as
though
every
word
were
being
spoken
for
a
listener
benefit
a
listener
who
sat
perhaps
with
pencil
and
notebook
somewhere
in
the
dark
behind
them
so
sorry
so
sorry
maggie
dear
so
sorry
the
words
ran
up
and
down
i
had
meant
to
take
you
away
before
the
service
was
over
elizabeth
could
have
sometimes
my
pain
is
very
bad
and
i
have
to
lie
down
you
know
but
it
nothing
nothing
really
only
i
glad
rather
that
you
should
share
all
our
little
troubles
because
then
you
know
us
better
wo
you
dear
maggie
there
been
something
between
us
all
this
time
has
there
ever
since
our
first
meeting
and
it
partly
been
my
fault
i
was
good
at
first
i
wanted
to
be
kind
but
i
was
stiff
and
shy
you
would
think
that
shy
i
am
terribly
i
always
have
been
since
i
was
very
little
and
just
to
enter
a
room
when
other
people
are
there
makes
me
so
embarrassed
i
remember
once
when
mother
was
alive
her
scolding
me
because
i
would
come
in
to
a
but
i
could
i
stood
outside
the
door
in
an
agony
doing
everything
to
make
myself
go
in
but
i
could
but
now
i
come
to
love
you
dear
although
of
course
you
have
your
faults
but
they
are
faults
of
your
age
carelessness
selfishness
they
are
nothing
in
the
eyes
of
god
who
understands
all
our
weaknesses
and
you
must
learn
to
know
him
dear
that
is
my
only
prayer
now
if
i
am
taken
if
i
go
before
the
great
day
if
it
be
his
will
then
i
pray
always
now
that
i
may
leave
you
in
my
place
waiting
for
him
as
i
have
waited
trusting
him
as
i
have
trusted
you
saw
what
it
means
to
us
what
it
must
mean
to
any
one
who
has
listened
there
were
times
years
ago
when
i
had
not
turned
to
god
when
i
did
not
care
when
i
thought
of
earthly
love
god
drew
me
to
himself
you
too
must
come
maggie
you
must
come
you
must
stay
outside
you
are
asked
you
are
invited
perhaps
you
will
be
compelled
the
voice
sank
maggie
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
from
the
cold
and
her
foot
had
gone
to
sleep
she
felt
obstinate
and
rebellious
and
frightened
she
could
not
think
clearly
and
the
words
that
came
from
her
suddenly
seemed
to
her
not
to
be
her
own
aunt
anne
i
want
to
do
everything
that
you
and
aunt
elizabeth
think
i
should
but
i
must
be
myself
must
i
i
grown
up
now
i
got
my
three
hundred
pounds
and
i
do
think
i
want
to
be
religious
i
very
grateful
to
you
and
aunt
elizabeth
but
i
not
a
help
to
you
much
afraid
i
know
i
very
careless
i
do
want
to
be
better
and
all
the
more
reason
perhaps
why
i
should
go
out
and
earn
my
own
living
i
learn
more
quickly
then
but
i
do
love
you
and
aunt
elizabeth
she
broke
off
she
did
not
love
them
she
knew
that
she
did
not
the
only
human
being
in
all
the
world
whom
she
loved
was
martin
nevertheless
there
did
come
to
her
suddenly
then
a
new
tenderness
for
her
aunt
the
actual
sight
of
her
pain
in
the
chapel
had
deeply
touched
her
and
now
her
eagerness
for
escape
was
mingled
with
a
longing
to
be
affectionate
and
good
but
aunt
anne
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
are
you
sure
you
not
cold
dear
no
aunt
their
hands
touched
but
you
are
put
that
rug
over
you
that
one
at
the
end
of
the
bed
i
quiet
now
i
think
perhaps
i
shall
sleep
a
little
is
there
anything
i
can
do
perhaps
turn
the
lamp
down
dear
that
it
a
little
more
now
if
you
just
raise
my
pillow
there
behind
my
head
that
the
way
why
what
a
good
nurse
you
are
maggie
as
tenderly
as
she
could
turned
the
pillow
patted
it
placed
it
beneath
her
aunt
head
she
was
close
against
her
aunt
face
and
the
eyes
seemed
suddenly
so
fierce
and
urgent
so
insistent
and
powerful
that
seeing
them
was
like
the
discovery
of
some
blazing
fire
in
an
empty
house
most
of
all
they
were
terrified
eyes
maggie
went
back
to
her
chair
after
that
she
sat
there
during
the
slow
evolution
of
eternity
eternity
unrolled
itself
before
her
on
and
on
and
on
grey
limitless
mist
and
space
comfortless
lifeless
hopeless
she
had
been
for
many
weeks
leading
a
thoroughly
unwholesome
life
in
that
old
house
with
those
old
women
she
did
not
herself
know
how
unhealthy
it
had
been
but
she
knew
that
she
missed
the
wide
fields
and
downs
of
glebeshire
the
winds
that
blew
from
the
sea
round
borhedden
the
air
that
swirled
and
raced
up
and
down
the
little
stony
strata
of
dreot
now
she
had
been
kept
indoors
had
had
no
fun
of
any
kind
had
looked
forward
to
magnus
as
her
chief
diversion
then
martin
had
come
and
suddenly
she
had
seen
how
dangerously
her
life
was
hemming
her
in
she
was
losing
courage
she
would
soon
be
afraid
to
speak
for
herself
at
all
she
would
soon
in
a
panic
at
these
thoughts
and
feeling
as
though
some
one
was
trying
to
push
her
down
into
a
coffin
whilst
she
was
still
alive
she
began
hurriedly
to
speak
although
she
did
not
know
whether
her
aunt
were
asleep
or
no
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
aunt
anne
that
i
wrote
a
letter
some
days
ago
and
posted
it
myself
it
was
to
a
lady
who
knew
father
once
in
glebeshire
and
she
said
that
if
ever
i
wanted
help
i
was
to
write
to
her
and
so
although
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
done
it
without
asking
you
first
still
i
was
afraid
you
might
want
me
to
so
i
sent
it
i
would
like
to
hurt
your
feelings
aunt
anne
and
it
is
that
not
happy
with
you
and
aunt
elizabeth
but
i
ought
to
be
earning
my
own
living
ought
i
and
i
only
got
my
three
hundred
pounds
i
i
not
complaining
but
i
do
know
about
anything
yet
do
i
i
ca
even
find
my
way
when
i
out
with
aunt
elizabeth
and
i
afraid
i
never
be
really
good
enough
to
be
religious
perhaps
if
wanted
me
to
be
i
might
be
now
but
he
never
cared
i
hope
you
be
angry
aunt
anne
but
i
did
like
i
did
really
when
i
was
there
i
thought
that
soon
i
begin
to
cry
like
the
others
but
it
was
only
because
every
one
else
was
crying
not
because
i
wanted
to
i
hope
you
wo
be
angry
but
i
afraid
i
never
be
religious
as
you
and
aunt
elizabeth
want
me
to
be
so
do
you
think
it
will
be
better
for
me
to
start
learning
something
else
right
away
maggie
poured
all
this
out
and
then
felt
immense
relief
at
last
she
was
honest
again
at
last
she
had
said
what
she
felt
and
they
knew
it
and
could
never
say
that
she
had
been
fair
with
them
she
felt
that
her
speech
had
cleared
the
air
in
every
kind
of
way
she
waited
for
her
aunt
reply
no
sound
came
from
the
bed
had
her
aunt
heard
perhaps
she
slept
maggie
waited
then
timidly
and
softly
she
said
aunt
anne
aunt
anne
no
reply
then
again
in
a
whisper
aunt
anne
aunt
anne
supposing
aunt
anne
maggie
trembled
then
commanding
herself
to
be
calm
she
bent
towards
the
bed
aunt
anne
are
you
asleep
suddenly
aunt
anne
face
was
there
the
eyes
closed
the
mouth
the
cheeks
pale
yellow
in
the
faint
reflection
from
the
lamp
there
was
no
stir
no
breath
aunt
anne
aunt
anne
maggie
whispered
in
terror
now
then
she
saw
that
her
aunt
was
sleeping
very
very
faintly
the
sheets
rose
and
fell
and
the
fingers
of
the
hand
on
the
coverlet
trembled
a
little
as
though
they
were
struggling
to
wake
then
aunt
anne
had
heard
nothing
after
all
but
it
might
be
that
she
was
pretending
just
to
see
what
maggie
would
say
aunt
anne
whispered
maggie
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
then
she
sat
back
on
her
seat
again
her
hands
folded
staring
straight
in
front
of
her
after
that
she
did
not
know
for
how
long
she
sat
there
in
a
state
somewhere
between
dream
and
reality
the
room
although
it
never
lost
its
familiarity
grew
uncouthly
strange
shapes
grey
and
dim
seemed
to
move
beneath
the
windows
humping
their
backs
spinning
out
into
long
limbs
hands
and
legs
and
gigantic
fingers
the
deadest
hour
of
the
night
was
come
the
outside
world
seemed
to
press
upon
the
house
the
whole
world
cold
thick
damp
lifeless
like
an
animal
slain
and
falling
with
its
full
weight
crushing
everything
beneath
it
perhaps
she
slept
she
did
not
know
martin
seemed
to
be
with
her
and
against
them
was
aunt
anne
her
back
against
the
door
her
hands
spread
refusing
to
let
them
pass
the
room
joined
in
the
struggle
the
floor
slipped
beneath
their
tread
the
curtain
swayed
forward
and
caught
them
in
its
folds
the
lamp
flickered
and
flickered
and
flickered
she
was
awake
suddenly
quite
acutely
aware
of
danger
she
rubbed
her
eyes
turned
and
in
the
dim
shadow
saw
her
aunt
sitting
up
in
bed
her
body
drawn
up
to
its
intensest
height
her
hands
pressing
down
flat
upon
the
bed
her
eyes
stared
as
though
they
would
break
down
all
boundaries
but
her
lips
trembled
like
the
lips
of
a
little
child
aunt
anne
what
is
it
maggie
whispered
it
the
pain
her
voice
was
far
away
as
though
some
one
were
speaking
from
the
passage
outside
the
door
it
the
pain
i
much
more
maggie
remembered
what
martha
had
told
her
about
the
drops
she
found
the
little
green
bottle
saw
the
glass
by
the
side
of
it
suddenly
she
heard
aunt
anne
oh
no
oh
no
god
i
ca
god
i
ca
i
ca
maggie
bent
over
the
bed
she
put
her
hand
behind
her
aunt
back
and
could
feel
the
whole
body
quivering
the
flesh
damp
beneath
the
she
steadied
her
then
put
the
glass
to
her
lips
the
cry
was
now
a
little
whisper
no
more
i
can
no
more
then
more
softly
still
thy
will
oh
lord
as
thou
wilt
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
hallowed
hallowed
she
sank
down
on
to
her
pillows
is
it
better
maggie
asked
her
aunt
caught
her
hand
you
must
leave
me
i
sha
live
long
but
you
must
stay
with
me
until
i
go
promise
me
promise
me
no
i
ca
promise
said
maggie
you
must
stay
you
must
stay
no
i
ca
promise
then
suddenly
kneeling
down
by
the
bed
she
put
her
hand
on
the
other
arm
aunt
anne
i
do
anything
for
you
anything
to
make
you
better
if
i
can
help
but
not
a
promise
i
ca
promise
ah
but
you
will
stay
aunt
anne
whisper
trembled
with
its
certainty
that
seemed
the
climax
of
the
night
to
maggie
then
she
felt
that
she
was
indeed
held
for
eternity
by
the
house
the
chapel
and
something
beyond
the
chapel
the
scent
of
the
medicine
the
closeness
of
the
room
the
darkness
and
the
sickness
seemed
to
close
all
about
her
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
and
she
would
never
get
out
she
would
never
get
out
the
door
slowly
very
softly
opened
and
old
martha
looked
in
she
been
very
bad
whispered
maggie
ay
i
heard
something
that
why
i
came
you
gave
her
the
drops
yes
she
sleep
a
bit
now
i
take
your
place
miss
maggie
it
time
you
went
back
to
your
bed
maggie
crept
away
she
came
down
to
breakfast
to
find
the
house
bathed
in
sunlight
and
the
parrot
singing
hoarsely
and
her
golden
hair
was
hanging
down
her
back
aunt
elizabeth
was
there
cheerful
and
almost
merry
in
her
fashion
the
world
was
normal
ghosts
out
of
fashion
and
this
morning
was
the
day
on
which
the
silver
was
cleaned
this
last
was
maggie
business
and
very
badly
she
did
it
never
being
thorough
and
having
a
fatal
habit
of
thinking
of
other
things
porridge
eggs
and
bacon
marmalade
and
her
golden
hair
was
hanging
croaked
edward
your
aunt
wo
come
down
this
morning
maggie
she
much
better
the
sun
shining
a
little
walk
will
be
a
good
thing
i
buy
the
calico
that
anne
talked
about
your
aunt
better
maggie
felt
ashamed
of
herself
what
desperate
silly
feelings
had
she
allowed
last
night
how
much
she
had
made
of
that
service
and
how
weak
she
was
to
give
way
so
easily
i
clean
the
silver
she
thought
i
do
it
better
than
ever
but
unfortunately
she
had
a
hole
in
her
stocking
and
aunt
elizabeth
like
a
sparrow
who
has
found
a
worm
told
her
about
it
crashaw
coming
to
tea
this
afternoon
she
concluded
that
why
anne
staying
in
bed
to
be
well
enough
the
stocking
and
crashaw
dimmed
a
little
of
the
morning
radiance
but
behind
them
was
the
thought
martin
must
come
it
was
like
a
message
his
look
last
night
she
even
sang
to
herself
as
she
scrubbed
at
the
silver
they
spent
a
domestic
morning
aunt
elizabeth
did
not
go
for
her
walk
but
instead
stayed
in
the
and
seated
at
the
end
of
the
long
her
head
just
appearing
above
the
worn
and
soiled
green
tried
to
discipline
the
week
household
accounts
she
worked
sucking
one
finger
after
another
and
poking
her
pencil
into
her
ears
one
pound
three
shillings
ham
ham
ham
at
one
moment
she
invited
the
cook
to
assist
her
and
that
lady
crimson
from
the
kitchen
fire
bared
arms
akimbo
stated
that
she
was
not
only
the
most
economical
woman
in
london
but
was
also
thanks
to
her
upbringing
one
of
the
most
sober
and
virtuous
and
if
miss
cardinal
had
anything
to
say
against
oh
no
aunt
elizabeth
had
nothing
to
say
against
only
this
one
pound
three
shillings
well
the
cook
could
help
that
she
was
one
to
let
a
penny
out
of
her
fingers
where
it
should
go
so
the
morning
hummed
along
came
the
silver
was
all
cleaned
the
stockings
changed
and
there
was
roast
chicken
thomas
with
his
wicked
eyes
came
slowly
majestically
upon
the
scene
but
even
he
was
not
sinister
being
interested
in
his
own
greed
rather
than
other
persons
sins
all
this
time
maggie
refused
to
think
martin
would
come
then
she
would
see
martin
martin
martin
she
went
up
into
her
bedroom
and
whispered
the
name
over
and
over
to
herself
whilst
she
tried
to
mend
her
stocking
she
flung
the
stocking
down
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
on
to
a
world
that
was
all
golden
cloud
and
racing
watery
blue
the
roofs
swam
like
floating
carpets
in
the
sun
detached
from
the
brick
and
mortar
beneath
them
carried
by
the
racing
clouds
it
was
only
at
that
sudden
gaze
that
she
realised
that
she
was
a
prisoner
all
her
alarm
came
back
to
her
why
ca
i
go
out
i
put
on
my
hat
and
just
walk
out
no
one
can
stop
me
no
one
but
she
knew
that
she
could
not
something
more
must
happen
first
she
turned
from
the
window
with
a
little
shudder
finished
very
clumsily
her
stocking
and
as
the
cuckoo
clock
struck
halfpast
three
went
down
to
the
there
to
her
surprise
she
found
caroline
smith
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
a
little
dimmed
caroline
from
her
memory
she
had
not
seen
caroline
for
a
fortnight
she
did
not
know
that
she
especially
wanted
to
see
caroline
now
however
it
was
very
certain
that
caroline
wanted
to
see
her
the
young
woman
was
dressed
in
silk
that
stood
out
from
her
slim
body
almost
like
a
crinoline
and
she
had
a
straw
hat
with
roses
perched
on
the
side
of
her
lovely
head
she
kissed
maggie
many
times
and
then
sitting
down
with
her
little
sharp
black
shoes
poked
out
in
front
of
her
she
ran
on
it
been
too
bad
maggie
dear
it
simply
ages
since
we
had
a
moment
is
it
but
it
has
been
my
fault
father
been
ill
bronchitis
and
i
had
to
help
mother
father
been
so
happy
he
just
been
able
to
lie
in
bed
for
days
and
think
about
god
none
of
those
tiresome
people
at
the
bank
to
interrupt
him
and
chicken
and
jelly
as
much
as
he
liked
he
was
so
unhappy
yesterday
when
he
had
to
go
back
to
work
poor
dear
but
maggie
i
hear
you
were
at
the
service
last
night
how
did
you
like
it
like
it
said
maggie
i
do
know
that
it
a
thing
one
likes
exactly
does
one
i
do
know
i
not
one
of
the
inside
saints
you
know
and
i
would
be
if
they
wanted
me
to
he
but
you
one
now
they
say
and
i
never
would
have
thought
it
you
do
look
a
bit
like
one
and
i
should
have
dreamt
that
you
ever
stand
that
sort
of
thing
you
look
so
maggie
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
out
that
she
was
not
an
inside
saint
and
would
never
be
one
when
caution
restrained
her
she
had
learnt
already
that
her
gay
young
companion
was
not
as
trustworthy
as
best
friends
ought
to
be
it
was
the
first
time
last
night
she
said
yes
i
know
and
miss
cardinal
was
ill
and
had
to
come
away
in
the
middle
did
she
it
must
have
been
a
simply
awful
meeting
because
mother
came
back
as
limp
as
anything
she
been
crying
buckets
and
has
a
dreadful
headache
i
suppose
crashaw
gave
it
them
i
never
heard
him
but
i
seen
him
horrid
old
monkey
i
hope
miss
cardinal
better
yes
thank
you
said
maggie
she
better
well
that
a
good
thing
i
so
glad
and
you
you
darling
what
did
you
think
of
it
all
i
sure
you
did
cry
buckets
i
can
see
you
sitting
there
as
quiet
as
anything
like
a
little
quaker
i
like
to
have
gone
just
to
have
seen
you
i
hear
martin
warlock
was
there
too
was
he
he
was
said
maggie
fancy
that
i
wonder
what
he
went
for
his
father
made
him
i
expect
you
know
they
say
he
getting
on
awfully
badly
at
home
and
that
there
are
quarrels
all
the
time
i
do
know
of
course
but
his
sister
ca
stand
him
she
always
showing
her
feelings
not
very
good
taste
i
think
but
thurston
eggs
her
on
they
be
making
a
match
of
it
one
day
those
two
i
say
maggie
caroline
drew
her
chair
close
i
give
you
a
secret
you
wo
tell
any
one
will
you
certainly
not
if
you
tell
me
not
to
said
maggie
well
martin
warlock
and
i
ever
since
he
came
back
oh
i
do
say
it
anything
really
but
he
attracted
by
me
and
would
like
to
go
farther
he
be
asking
me
to
marry
him
one
of
these
days
and
then
i
have
fun
he
would
have
done
the
other
day
if
i
let
him
i
like
him
rather
do
you
he
getting
a
bit
fat
of
course
but
he
got
nice
eyes
and
then
he
a
real
man
i
like
real
men
but
there
be
thinking
me
coarse
i
know
you
will
i
not
coarse
really
only
impulsive
you
do
like
me
honestly
if
it
were
known
oh
no
you
do
i
can
tell
i
always
know
but
i
do
care
i
love
you
a
darling
and
what
i
say
is
if
you
love
some
one
just
love
them
never
mind
what
they
think
do
you
agree
with
me
but
you
would
you
would
think
of
loving
anybody
but
i
not
really
bad
only
careless
mother
says
what
mother
said
could
not
be
known
because
the
door
opened
and
martha
announced
crashaw
the
old
man
leaning
on
a
walking
stick
came
forward
and
greeted
maggie
and
caroline
with
and
amiability
he
was
indeed
in
a
very
mild
old
man
and
it
was
difficult
for
maggie
to
believe
that
this
was
the
same
who
last
night
had
frightened
her
out
of
her
wits
and
led
her
to
the
edge
of
such
strange
suspicions
he
was
more
than
ever
like
a
monkey
with
his
bony
brown
forehead
protuberant
eyes
and
large
mottled
nose
and
he
sat
there
all
huddled
up
by
his
rheumatism
a
living
example
of
present
physical
torments
rather
than
future
spiritual
ones
it
was
apparent
at
once
that
he
liked
pretty
young
women
and
he
paid
caroline
a
number
of
flattering
attentions
disregarding
maggie
with
a
frankness
that
witnessed
to
a
life
that
had
taught
one
lesson
at
least
never
on
any
occasion
to
waste
time
maggie
did
not
mind
it
amused
her
to
see
her
terror
of
the
night
before
transformed
into
a
mere
serenading
crippled
old
gentleman
and
to
see
too
the
excited
pleasure
with
which
caroline
accepted
even
such
decayed
attentions
as
these
but
what
was
it
that
had
persuaded
her
last
night
why
did
she
now
spend
her
time
half
in
one
world
and
half
in
another
which
world
was
the
real
one
aunt
anne
very
soon
joined
them
and
this
quiet
composed
figure
only
added
to
maggie
scorn
of
her
last
night
terrors
was
this
the
same
who
had
struggled
with
such
agony
who
had
made
maggie
feel
that
she
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
imprisoned
for
ever
the
sun
beat
hotly
upon
the
carpet
caroline
silk
shone
and
glowed
the
tea
was
poured
out
and
there
was
chatter
about
the
warm
winter
that
it
was
and
how
time
passed
and
how
fashions
changed
and
how
you
never
saw
a
now
and
what
they
were
turning
kingsway
into
and
what
they
were
turning
the
law
courts
out
of
and
even
once
by
crashaw
a
word
about
the
lyceum
theatre
where
some
one
was
playing
the
merchant
of
venice
which
was
a
fine
play
and
could
do
no
one
any
harm
but
i
daresay
said
crashaw
that
this
young
lady
here
goes
to
nothing
but
plays
every
night
of
her
life
why
crashaw
said
caroline
tossing
her
head
if
that
the
kind
of
life
you
fancy
i
lead
you
completely
mistaken
theatres
indeed
never
do
i
put
so
much
as
the
tip
of
my
nose
inside
one
father
thinks
they
wrong
and
so
does
mother
say
she
does
although
i
know
she
likes
them
really
but
any
way
that
does
matter
because
i
never
have
a
moment
to
myself
sitting
at
home
sewing
that
the
way
i
spend
my
days
mr
crashaw
it
was
the
very
last
way
she
really
spent
them
as
maggie
perfectly
well
knew
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
crashaw
either
was
deceived
however
he
gave
a
wicked
wink
with
the
eye
that
was
least
rheumatic
and
said
something
about
a
beautiful
young
lady
like
miss
smith
wasted
on
sewing
and
darning
and
caroline
smiled
and
said
something
about
one
day
perhaps
and
aunt
anne
looked
remotely
benevolent
what
did
she
think
of
all
this
maggie
wondered
what
did
she
think
of
her
great
preacher
her
prophet
wasting
the
few
hours
of
life
that
remained
to
him
over
such
a
business
they
had
some
secret
understanding
perhaps
as
though
they
said
to
one
another
we
know
you
and
i
what
are
our
real
intentions
beneath
all
this
we
only
do
what
we
must
understanding
or
no
crashaw
sprang
up
with
unexpected
activity
when
caroline
departed
and
announced
his
intention
of
conducting
her
to
her
door
he
made
his
adieus
and
then
hobbled
along
after
the
silk
as
though
this
was
his
last
chance
of
warming
his
hands
at
the
flame
of
life
when
they
were
gone
aunt
anne
said
i
am
going
back
to
bed
maggie
dear
martha
will
send
me
up
some
supper
later
elizabeth
has
gone
to
lambeth
to
see
a
friend
so
make
yourself
busy
until
seven
dear
if
i
want
anything
i
ring
when
she
was
left
alone
in
the
darkening
room
she
stood
there
thinking
why
should
she
not
go
out
and
find
martin
she
did
not
care
what
any
one
thought
she
would
go
to
his
house
and
ask
for
him
she
had
waited
and
waited
she
wanted
him
so
she
wanted
him
so
desperately
then
martha
opened
the
door
and
announced
him
yes
really
announced
him
saying
it
young
warlock
miss
and
he
says
if
your
aunts
is
in
you
do
ask
him
to
come
up
martha
said
maggie
and
then
held
herself
there
rooted
where
she
stood
so
that
she
should
not
run
to
him
and
fling
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
felt
at
once
with
that
quick
perception
that
was
hers
in
spite
of
her
ignorance
of
life
that
this
was
no
moment
for
and
that
he
wanted
something
quite
other
from
her
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
looked
round
the
room
did
come
to
her
but
stayed
where
he
was
i
been
trying
to
see
you
all
day
he
said
how
long
have
we
got
alone
do
you
think
she
never
took
her
eyes
from
his
face
until
seven
probably
aunt
elizabeth
in
lambeth
and
aunt
anne
in
bed
that
luck
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
then
moved
over
to
the
fireplace
maggie
i
come
to
say
we
must
see
one
another
any
more
some
one
some
vast
figure
shadowy
behind
her
moved
suddenly
forward
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
his
embrace
was
deadly
cold
she
stood
where
she
was
her
hands
at
her
side
looking
steadfastly
at
him
why
she
said
because
because
the
fact
is
i
been
wrong
altogether
maggie
i
not
the
sort
of
man
for
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
do
know
much
about
life
yet
do
you
i
about
the
first
man
you
ever
met
are
i
if
you
met
another
man
before
me
you
have
cared
for
him
as
much
she
said
nothing
and
he
seemed
to
be
confused
by
her
steady
gaze
because
he
looked
down
and
continued
to
speak
as
though
to
himself
i
knew
at
once
that
there
was
danger
in
our
meeting
with
other
girls
they
can
look
after
themselves
one
has
any
responsibility
to
them
it
their
own
affair
but
you
believe
every
word
a
fellow
says
and
if
we
been
friends
it
would
have
mattered
but
from
the
very
first
we
were
that
we
were
something
more
you
were
so
different
from
any
other
girl
i
wanted
to
be
good
to
you
from
the
beginning
but
now
i
see
that
if
we
go
on
i
shall
only
be
bad
it
all
comes
in
the
end
to
my
being
bad
really
bad
and
i
want
you
to
know
it
i
do
know
said
maggie
that
i
thought
very
much
whether
you
good
or
bad
and
it
does
matter
i
can
look
after
myself
no
you
ca
he
said
vehemently
making
a
step
towards
her
and
then
suddenly
stopping
that
just
it
you
ca
i
been
thinking
all
the
time
since
the
other
evening
when
we
were
together
and
i
seen
that
you
believe
every
word
i
say
and
you
trust
me
i
do
mean
to
tell
lies
i
do
know
that
i
worse
than
most
other
men
but
i
not
good
enough
for
you
to
trust
in
all
the
same
i
been
knocking
about
for
years
and
i
suppose
i
had
most
of
my
idealism
knocked
out
of
me
anyway
i
do
believe
in
most
people
and
you
still
do
i
not
going
to
be
the
one
to
change
you
perhaps
i
know
more
about
life
than
you
think
said
maggie
no
how
can
you
you
never
had
a
chance
of
seeing
any
of
it
get
sick
of
me
in
no
time
i
moody
and
selfish
and
i
used
to
drink
a
bit
too
and
i
ca
be
faithful
to
women
i
might
think
i
was
going
to
be
faithful
to
you
and
swear
i
would
be
and
then
suddenly
some
one
would
come
along
i
thought
for
a
bit
i
just
go
on
with
you
and
see
what
came
of
it
you
so
unusual
you
make
me
want
to
be
straight
with
you
but
i
seen
it
would
be
fair
i
must
just
slip
out
of
your
path
and
you
forget
me
and
then
you
meet
a
much
better
man
than
i
and
be
happy
i
queer
i
have
funny
moods
that
last
for
days
and
days
sometimes
i
seem
to
do
every
one
harm
i
come
in
touch
with
there
my
father
now
i
love
him
more
than
any
one
in
the
world
and
yet
i
make
him
unhappy
all
the
time
i
a
bad
fellow
to
be
with
he
stopped
suddenly
looked
at
her
and
laughed
it
is
any
good
maggie
you
have
any
idea
what
a
sweep
i
am
you
hate
me
if
you
really
knew
she
looked
steadily
back
at
him
we
have
much
time
she
said
speaking
with
steady
calm
conviction
as
though
she
had
for
years
been
expecting
just
such
a
conversation
as
this
and
had
thought
out
what
she
would
say
aunt
elizabeth
can
come
back
earlier
than
she
said
perhaps
i
shall
say
something
i
ought
to
i
do
care
the
whole
thing
is
that
i
love
you
i
suppose
it
true
that
i
do
know
anything
about
men
but
i
be
poor
enough
if
my
love
for
you
just
depended
on
your
loving
me
back
and
on
your
being
good
to
me
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
never
had
any
one
i
could
love
until
you
came
but
now
that
you
have
come
it
ca
be
anything
that
you
can
do
that
can
alter
it
if
you
were
to
go
away
i
still
love
you
because
it
the
love
in
me
that
matters
not
what
i
get
for
it
perhaps
you
make
me
unhappy
but
anyway
one
will
be
unhappy
some
of
the
time
she
went
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
i
know
caroline
smith
or
some
one
would
be
very
shocked
if
they
thought
i
said
such
things
to
you
but
i
ca
help
what
they
say
he
had
a
movement
to
catch
her
and
hold
her
but
he
kept
himself
off
moved
away
from
her
turning
his
back
to
her
you
do
understand
you
do
understand
he
repeated
you
know
nothing
about
men
maggie
and
you
know
nothing
about
me
i
tell
you
i
would
be
faithful
to
you
and
i
be
drunk
sometimes
and
have
moods
for
days
when
i
just
sulk
and
not
speak
to
a
soul
i
think
those
moods
some
damned
sort
of
religion
when
i
in
them
but
what
they
really
are
is
bad
temper
you
got
to
know
it
maggie
be
rotten
to
you
however
much
i
wanted
not
to
be
that
my
own
affair
she
answered
i
can
look
after
myself
and
for
all
the
rest
i
independent
and
i
always
be
independent
i
love
you
whether
you
good
to
me
or
bad
well
then
he
suddenly
wheeled
round
to
her
you
better
have
it
i
married
already
she
took
that
with
a
little
startled
cry
her
eyes
searched
his
face
in
a
puzzled
fashion
as
though
she
were
pursuing
the
truth
then
she
said
like
a
child
who
sees
some
toy
broken
before
its
eyes
oh
martin
yes
nobody
knows
not
a
soul
it
was
a
mad
thing
four
years
ago
in
marseille
i
met
a
girl
a
little
dressmaker
there
i
went
off
my
head
and
married
her
and
then
a
month
later
she
ran
off
with
a
merchant
chap
a
greek
i
did
care
we
got
on
as
badly
as
anything
but
there
you
are
no
one
knows
that
the
whole
thing
maggie
i
thought
at
first
i
would
tell
you
i
was
beginning
to
care
for
you
too
much
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
then
when
your
uncle
asked
me
to
dinner
i
told
myself
i
was
a
fool
to
go
then
when
i
saw
how
you
trusted
me
i
thought
i
be
a
cad
and
let
it
continue
but
somehow
you
got
an
influence
over
me
you
made
me
ashamed
of
things
i
have
hesitated
about
a
year
ago
and
the
funny
thing
is
it
is
your
looks
i
can
say
things
to
you
i
could
to
other
women
and
i
tell
you
right
away
that
there
are
lots
of
women
attract
me
more
and
yet
i
never
felt
about
any
woman
as
i
do
about
you
that
i
wanted
to
be
good
to
her
and
care
for
her
and
love
her
it
always
whether
they
loved
me
that
i
thought
about
well
now
i
told
you
you
see
that
i
better
go
had
i
you
see
you
see
she
looked
up
at
him
i
got
to
think
it
makes
a
difference
of
course
can
we
meet
after
a
week
and

altogether

week

after
a
week
and
if
we
ca

alone
i
give
you
a
letter
somehow
please
martin
you
must
maggie
just
think
no
after
a
week
very
well
then
he
turned
on
her
fiercely
i
been
honest
told
you
i
done
all
i
can
if
i
love
you
now
it
is
my
fault
he
left
the
room
not
looking
at
her
again
and
she
stood
there
staring
in
front
of
her
chapter
vi
the
prophet
in
his
own
home
martin
walked
into
the
street
with
a
confused
sense
of
triumph
and
defeat
that
confusion
that
comes
to
all
sensitive
men
at
the
moment
when
they
are
stepping
against
their
will
from
one
set
of
conditions
into
another
he
had
gone
into
that
house
only
half
an
hour
ago
determined
to
leave
maggie
for
ever
for
his
good
and
hers
he
came
back
into
the
street
realising
that
he
was
now
perhaps
for
the
first
time
quite
definitely
involved
in
some
relation
with
her
good
bad
safe
dangerous
he
did
not
know
but
involved
he
had
intended
to
tell
her
nothing
of
his
marriage
and
he
had
told
her
he
had
intended
to
treat
their
whole
meeting
as
something
light
passing
inconsiderable
he
had
instead
treated
it
as
something
of
the
utmost
gravity
he
had
intended
above
all
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
could
do
what
he
wished
he
had
found
that
he
had
no
power
and
so
as
he
stepped
through
the
dim
of
the
evening
light
he
was
stirred
with
an
immense
sense
of
having
stepped
definitely
at
last
across
the
threshold
of
new
adventure
and
enterprise
all
kinds
of
problems
were
awaiting
solution
his
relation
to
his
father
his
mother
his
sister
his
home
his
past
his
future
his
sins
and
his
weaknesses
and
he
had
meant
to
solve
them
all
as
he
had
often
solved
them
in
the
past
by
simply
cutting
adrift
but
now
instead
of
that
he
had
decided
to
stay
and
face
it
all
out
he
had
confessed
at
last
that
secret
that
he
had
hidden
from
all
the
world
and
he
had
submitted
to
the
will
of
a
girl
whom
he
scarcely
knew
and
was
not
even
sure
that
he
liked
he
stopped
at
that
for
a
moment
and
standing
in
a
little
pool
of
purple
light
under
the
benignant
friendliness
of
a
golden
moon
new
risen
and
solitary
he
considered
it
no
he
did
not
know
whether
he
liked
her
it
was
interest
rather
that
drew
him
her
strangeness
her
strength
and
loneliness
young
and
solitary
like
the
moon
above
him
and
yet
also
some
feeling
softer
than
interest
so
that
he
was
suddenly
touched
as
he
thought
of
her
and
spoke
out
aloud
i
be
good
to
her
whatever
happens
by
god
i
be
good
to
her
so
that
a
chauffeur
near
him
turned
and
looked
with
hard
scornful
eyes
and
a
girl
somewhere
laughed
with
all
his
conventional
dislike
of
being
in
any
way
odd
he
walked
hurriedly
on
confused
and
wondering
more
than
ever
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
him
always
before
he
had
known
his
own
mind
now
in
everything
he
seemed
to
be
pulled
two
ways
it
was
as
though
some
spell
had
been
thrown
over
him
it
was
a
lovely
evening
and
he
walked
slowly
not
wishing
to
enter
his
house
too
quickly
he
realised
that
he
had
during
the
last
weeks
found
nothing
there
but
trouble
and
if
maggie
wished
in
spite
of
what
he
had
told
her
to
go
on
with
him
and
if
his
father
impatient
at
last
definitely
asked
him
to
stay
at
home
altogether
and
insisted
on
an
answer
and
if
his
gradually
increasing
estrangement
with
his
sister
broke
into
open
quarrel
and
if
strangest
of
all
this
religious
business
that
in
such
manifestations
as
the
chapel
service
of
last
night
he
hated
with
all
his
soul
held
him
after
all
he
was
in
garrick
street
outside
the
curiosity
shop
his
latchkey
in
his
hand
he
stopped
and
stared
down
the
street
as
he
had
done
once
before
weeks
ago
was
not
the
root
of
all
his
trouble
simply
this
that
he
was
becoming
against
his
will
interested
drawn
in
that
there
were
things
going
on
that
his
common
sense
rejected
as
nonsense
but
that
nevertheless
were
throwing
out
feelers
like
the
twisting
threats
of
an
octopus
touching
him
now
only
faintly
here
for
a
second
there
for
a
second
but
fascinating
holding
him
so
that
he
could
not
run
away
granted
that
thurston
was
a
charlatan
miss
avies
a
humbug
his
sister
a
fool
his
father
a
dreamer
crashaw
a
fanatic
did
that
mean
that
the
power
behind
them
all
was
sham
was
that
force
that
he
had
felt
when
he
was
a
child
simply
eager
superstition
what
was
behind
this
street
this
moon
these
hurrying
figures
his
own
daily
life
and
thoughts
was
there
really
a
vast
conspiracy
a
huge
involving
plot
moving
under
the
cardboard
surface
of
the
world
a
plot
that
he
had
by
an
accident
of
birth
spied
upon
and
discovered
always
every
day
now
thoughts
suspicions
speculations
were
coming
upon
him
uninvited
undesired
from
somewhere
from
some
one
he
did
not
want
them
he
wanted
only
the
material
physical
life
of
the
ordinary
man
it
must
be
because
he
was
idling
he
would
get
work
at
once
join
with
some
one
in
the
city
go
abroad
again
but
perhaps
even
then
he
would
not
escape
thoughts
like
those
of
the
last
weeks
did
not
depend
for
their
urgency
on
place
or
time
and
maggie
she
was
mixed
up
in
it
all
he
was
aware
as
he
hesitated
before
opening
the
door
of
the
strangest
feeling
of
belonging
to
her
not
love
nor
passion
not
sentiment
even
only
as
though
he
had
suddenly
realised
that
with
new
perils
he
had
received
also
new
protection
he
went
upstairs
with
a
feeling
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
events
that
would
change
his
whole
world
as
martin
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
black
crooked
staircase
he
was
conscious
as
though
it
had
been
shown
him
in
a
vision
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
some
scene
that
might
shape
for
him
the
whole
course
of
his
future
life
he
had
been
aware
once
or
twice
before
of
such
a
premonition
and
as
with
most
men
half
of
him
had
rejected
and
half
of
him
received
the
warning
however
there
were
reasons
enough
for
thinking
this
no
mere
baseless
superstition
with
maggie
with
his
father
with
his
sister
with
his
own
life
the
decision
had
got
to
be
taken
and
it
was
with
an
abrupt
determination
that
he
would
end
at
all
costs
the
fears
and
uncertainties
of
these
last
weeks
that
he
pushed
back
the
and
entered
he
noticed
at
once
strange
garments
hanging
on
the
rack
and
a
bright
purple
umbrella
which
belonged
as
he
knew
to
a
certain
alweed
a
friend
of
his
mother
and
a
faithful
servant
of
the
chapel
stiff
and
assertive
in
the
there
was
a
apparently
well
he
could
not
face
that
immediately
he
would
have
to
go
in
afterwards
meanwhile
he
turned
down
the
passage
pushed
back
his
father
door
and
entered
he
paused
abruptly
in
the
doorway
there
standing
in
front
of
the
window
facing
him
his
pale
chin
in
the
air
his
legs
apart
supercilious
and
stood
thurston
his
father
desk
was
littered
with
papers
rustling
and
blowing
a
little
in
the
breeze
from
the
window
that
was
never
perfectly
closed
one
candle
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
its
flame
swaying
in
the
air
was
the
only
light
martin
first
impulse
was
to
turn
abruptly
back
again
and
go
up
to
his
room
he
could
not
speak
to
that
fellow
now
he
could
not
he
half
turned
then
something
stopped
him
halloo
he
said
where
father
do
know
said
thurston
sucking
the
words
through
his
teeth
been
wanting
him
too
well
as
he
is
here
said
martin
fiercely
no
use
me
waiting
quite
so
all
the
same
i
going
to
wait
the
two
figures
were
strangely
contrasted
martin
with
health
thick
and
square
thurston
pale
with
a
spotted
complexion
dim
and
watery
eyes
legs
and
arms
like
sticks
his
black
clothes
shabby
and
his
boots
dusty
nevertheless
at
that
moment
it
was
thurston
who
had
the
power
he
moved
forward
from
the
window
makes
you
fair
sick
to
see
me
anywhere
about
the
does
it
oh
i
know
you
ca
kid
me
i
seen
from
the
first
you
fair
loathe
the
sight
of
me
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
martin
uneasily
whether
we
like
one
another
or
not
there
no
need
to
discuss
it
oh
is
there
said
thurston
coming
a
little
closer
so
that
he
was
standing
now
directly
under
the
light
of
the
candle
why
not
why
should
we
what
the
i
believe
in
discussing
things
myself
i
do
really
i
said
to
myself
a
long
way
back
now
the
first
time
i
get
alone
i
ask
him
why
does
dislike
me
i
always
been
civil
to
him
i
says
to
myself
yet
i
ca
please
him
so
i
just
ask
him
straight
martin
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
wanted
to
leave
the
room
but
something
in
thurston
held
him
there
i
suppose
we
are
the
sort
to
get
on
together
we
have
got
enough
in
common
he
said
clumsily
i
do
know
about
that
thurston
said
in
a
friendly
conversational
tone
i
should
wonder
if
we
got
more
in
common
than
you
fancy
now
i
tell
you
right
out
i
like
you
i
always
liked
you
and
what
more
i
always
shall
whatever
you
do
i
do
care
broke
in
martin
angrily
whether
you
like
me
or
not
no
i
know
you
do
thurston
continued
quietly
and
i
know
what
you
think
of
me
too
this
is
your
idea
of
me
i
reckon
that
i
a
pushing
uneducated
common
bounder
that
just
using
this
religious
business
to
shove
himself
along
with
that
kidding
all
these
poor
old
ladies
that
believes
in
their
bunkum
and
is
altogether
about
as
a
fellow
as
you
likely
to
meet
with
that
about
the
colour
of
it
is
it
martin
said
nothing
that
was
exactly
the
colour
of
it
yes
well
thurston
continued
a
faint
flush
on
his
pale
cheeks
of
course
i
know
that
all
right
and
i
tell
you
the
idea
that
i
might
of
you
only
might
mind
you
why
that
you
a
ignorant
sort
of
feller
that
been
rolling
up
and
down
all
over
europe
gets
a
bit
of
money
comes
over
and
bullies
his
father
thinks
knows
better
than
every
one
about
things
knows
nothing
about
whatever
look
here
thurston
martin
interrupted
stepping
forward
i
tell
you
i
do
care
a
curse
what
a
man
like
i
only
said
might
mind
you
said
thurston
smiling
it
only
a
fool
would
think
that
of
you
really
and
i
not
a
fool
no
really
i
not
i
got
quite
another
idea
of
you
my
idea
is
that
you
one
of
us
whether
you
want
to
be
or
not
and
that
you
always
will
be
one
of
us
that
why
i
like
you
and
will
be
a
friend
to
you
too
i
tell
you
i
do
want
your
damned
friendship
martin
cried
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
or
your
opinion
or
your
plans
or
anything
else
that
all
right
said
thurston
i
quite
understand
it
natural
enough
to
feel
as
you
do
but
i
afraid
you
to
something
to
do
with
me
i
not
quite
what
you
think
me
and
you
not
quite
what
you
think
yourself
there
two
of
each
of
us
that
the
truth
of
it
i
may
be
a
sham
and
a
charlatan
one
part
of
me
i
do
know
sure
i
certainly
do
believe
all
your
governor
does
i
do
believe
all
i
say
and
i
do
say
all
i
think
but
then
does
you
yourself
i
even
tell
you
straight
out
that
when
i
just
came
into
the
business
i
laughed
at
the
lot
of
your
father
and
all
silly
lot
o
softs
they
are
i
said
to
myself
believe
all
that
nonsense
but
now
i
do
know
when
you
been
at
this
game
a
bit
you
scarcely
know
what
you
do
believe
that
the
truth
of
it
there
may
be
something
in
it
after
all
sometimes
well
it
surprise
you
if
you
seen
all
the
things
i
have
oh
i
do
mean
ghosts
and
spirits
and
all
that
kind
of
nonsense
no
but
the
kind
of
thing
that
to
people
you
never
expect
you
getting
caught
into
it
yourself
i
watched
you
all
along
but
that
is
the
point
the
point
is
that
i
not
so
bad
as
you
think
nor
so
simple
neither
and
life
is
so
simple
nor
religion
nor
love
nor
anything
as
you
think
it
you
young
yet
you
know
very
young
martin
turned
back
to
the
door
all
very
interesting
thurston
he
said
you
can
think
what
you
like
of
course
all
the
same
the
less
we
see
of
one
another
well
said
thurston
slowly
smiling
that
be
a
bit
difficult
to
avoid
one
another
i
mean
you
see
i
going
to
marry
your
sister
martin
laughed
inside
him
something
was
saying
now
look
out
this
is
all
a
trap
he
does
mean
what
he
says
he
trying
to
catch
you
going
to
marry
amy
oh
no
you
not
thurston
did
not
appear
to
be
interested
in
anything
that
martin
had
to
say
he
continued
as
though
he
were
pursuing
his
own
thoughts
yes
so
it
be
difficult
i
did
think
you
like
it
when
you
heard
i
said
to
amy
wo
like
it
i
said
she
said
you
been
too
long
away
from
the
family
to
judge
and
so
you
have
you
know
oh
amy
and
i
be
right
enough
she
a
fine
woman
your
sister
martin
burst
out
well
then
that
settles
it
it
simply
settles
it
that
finishes
it
finishes
what
asked
thurston
smiling
in
a
friendly
way
never
you
mind
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
has
my
father
consented
yes
said
all
wanted
was
for
amy
to
be
and
so
she
will
be
i
look
after
her
you
come
round
to
it
in
time
father
agrees
my
god
but
it
impossible
do
you
see
you
see
i
the
sudden
sense
of
his
impotence
called
back
his
words
he
felt
nothing
but
rage
and
indignation
against
the
whole
set
of
them
against
the
house
they
were
in
the
very
table
with
the
papers
blowing
upon
it
and
the
candle
shining
well
it
made
his
own
affair
more
simple
that
was
certain
he
must
be
off
right
away
from
them
all
stay
in
the
house
with
that
fellow
for
a
stay
when
it
all
right
said
thurston
moistening
his
pale
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
you
see
it
in
time
it
the
best
thing
that
could
and
we
got
more
in
common
than
you
ever
suppose
we
really
you
a
religious
man
really
ca
escape
your
destiny
you
know
there
religious
and
and
it
does
matter
what
your
creed
is
whether
you
a
christian
or
a
there
it
is
and
if
you
religious
you
religious
i
may
be
the
greatest
humbug
on
the
market
but
i
religious
it
like
a
lip
you
be
bothered
with
it
all
your
life
but
what
more
thurston
may
have
said
martin
did
not
hear
he
had
left
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
him
on
what
was
his
indignation
based
injured
pride
and
was
he
really
indignant
was
not
something
within
him
elated
because
by
this
he
had
been
offered
his
freedom
thurston
marry
his
sister
he
could
go
his
own
way
now
even
his
father
could
not
expect
him
to
remain
and
he
wanted
maggie
urgently
passionately
standing
for
a
moment
there
in
the
dark
passage
he
wanted
her
he
was
lonely
disregarded
despised
they
did
not
care
for
him
here
no
one
cared
for
him
anywhere
only
maggie
who
was
and
truthful
and
sure
beyond
any
human
being
whom
he
had
ever
known
then
with
a
very
youthful
sense
of
challenging
this
world
that
had
so
grossly
insulted
him
by
admitting
thurston
into
the
heart
of
it
he
joined
the
there
in
the
pink
close
soft
atmosphere
sat
his
mother
amy
alweed
and
little
miss
pyncheon
his
mother
with
her
lace
cap
and
white
hair
and
soft
plump
hands
was
pouring
tea
through
a
strainer
as
though
it
were
a
rite
on
her
plate
were
three
little
frilly
papers
that
had
held
sugary
cakes
on
her
lips
were
fragments
of
sugar
amy
in
an
ugly
grey
dress
sat
severely
straight
upon
a
hard
chair
and
was
apparently
listening
to
miss
pyncheon
but
her
eyes
suspicious
and
restless
moved
like
the
eyes
of
a
newly
captured
animal
alweed
stout
in
pink
with
a
large
hat
full
of
roses
smiled
and
smiled
waiting
only
for
a
moment
when
she
could
amble
off
once
again
into
space
safe
on
the
old
broad
back
of
her
family
experiences
the
only
conversational
steed
to
whose
care
she
ever
entrusted
herself
she
had
a
son
hector
a
husband
alweed
and
a
miss
alweed
she
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
the
absorbed
attention
of
the
slightest
of
her
acquaintances
hector
he
my
boy
you
know
although
why
i
call
him
a
boy
i
ca
think
because
he
and
a
half
he
at
cambridge
christs
college
well
this
morning
i
had
a
letter
she
would
begin
she
began
now
upon
martin
his
mind
wandered
he
looked
about
the
little
room
and
thought
of
thurston
why
was
he
not
more
angry
about
it
all
he
had
pretended
to
be
indignant
he
had
hated
thurston
as
he
stood
there
but
had
he
half
of
him
hated
him
then
with
a
jerk
thurston
words
came
back
to
him
there
two
of
each
of
us
that
the
truth
of
it
two
of
each
of
us
sitting
there
listening
to
alweed
voice
that
flowed
like
a
river
behind
him
he
saw
the
two
figures
saw
them
quite
clearly
and
distinctly
flesh
and
blood
even
clothes
and
voices
and
smile
and
he
knew
that
all
his
life
these
two
figures
had
been
growing
waiting
for
the
moment
when
he
would
recognise
them
one
figure
was
the
martin
whom
he
knew
brown
healthy
strong
and
sane
a
figure
wearing
his
clothes
his
own
clothes
the
tweeds
and
the
cloths
the
brogues
and
the
heavy
boots
the
soft
untidy
hats
the
figure
was
hard
definite
resolute
quarrelling
arguing
loving
joking
swearing
all
in
the
sensible
way
it
was
a
figure
that
all
the
world
had
understood
that
had
been
drunk
often
enough
lent
other
men
money
been
and
extravagant
and
thoughtless
a
good
chap
a
sensible
fellow
a
pal
no
flies
on
warlock
that
was
the
kind
of
figure
and
the
life
had
been
physical
had
never
asked
questions
had
never
known
morbidity
had
lived
on
what
it
saw
and
could
touch
and
could
break
and
the
other
figure
that
was
physically
less
plainly
seen
no
there
it
was
standing
a
little
away
from
the
other
standing
away
contemptuously
despising
it
deriding
it
fat
soft
white
hanging
cheeks
wearing
anything
to
cover
its
body
but
shining
in
some
way
through
the
clothes
so
that
it
was
body
that
you
saw
a
soft
body
hands
soft
and
the
colour
of
the
flesh
pale
and
unhealthy
but
it
was
the
eyes
that
spoke
the
mouth
trembled
and
was
weak
the
chin
was
fat
and
feeble
but
the
eyes
lived
lived
were
eager
fighting
beseeching
longing
captive
eyes
and
this
figure
martin
knew
was
a
prey
to
every
morbid
desire
rushed
to
sensual
excess
and
then
crept
back
miserably
to
search
for
some
spiritual
flagellation
above
all
it
was
restless
as
some
one
presses
round
a
dark
room
searching
for
the
lock
of
the
door
restless
and
lonely
cowardly
and
selfish
but
searching
and
sensitive
and
even
faithful
faithful
to
something
or
to
some
one
pursued
also
by
something
or
some
one
a
figure
to
whom
this
world
offered
only
opportunities
for
sin
and
failure
and
defeat
but
a
figure
to
whom
this
world
was
the
merest
shadow
hiding
as
a
shade
hides
a
lamp
the
life
within
wretched
enough
with
its
bad
health
its
growing
corpulence
its
weak
mouth
its
furtive
desires
but
despising
nevertheless
the
strong
healthy
figure
beside
it
thurston
was
right
men
are
not
born
to
be
free
but
to
fight
to
the
very
death
for
the
imprisonment
and
destruction
of
all
that
is
easiest
and
most
physically
active
and
most
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
touch
and
so
hector
really
hopes
that
he
be
able
to
get
down
to
us
for
christmas
although
he
been
asked
to
go
on
this
reading
party
of
course
it
simply
a
question
as
to
whether
he
works
better
at
home
or
with
his
friends
if
he
were
a
weak
character
i
think
alweed
would
insist
in
his
coming
home
but
hector
really
cares
for
his
work
more
than
anything
he
never
been
very
good
at
games
his
short
sight
prevents
him
poor
boy
and
as
he
very
justly
remarked
when
he
was
home
last
holidays
do
see
mother
how
i
am
going
to
do
my
duty
as
a
solicitor
that
what
he
hopes
to
be
if
i
do
work
now
many
men
regard
cambridge
as
a
time
for
play
not
so
i
but
i
hope
that
if
hector
comes
home
this
christmas
he
attend
the
chapel
services
the
influence
your
father
might
have
on
such
a
boy
as
hector
warlock
a
boy
sensitive
and
thoughtful
i
was
saying
miss
pyncheon
that
hector
miss
pyncheon
was
the
soul
of
but
she
was
much
more
than
that
she
was
by
far
the
most
sensible
genial
and
worldly
of
the
inside
saints
it
was
in
fact
astonishing
that
she
should
be
an
inside
saint
at
all
of
them
all
she
impressed
martin
the
most
because
there
was
nothing
of
the
crank
about
her
she
went
to
theatres
to
the
seaside
in
the
summer
took
in
the
queen
and
was
a
subscriber
to
boots
circulating
library
she
dressed
quietly
and
in
excellent
taste
in
grey
or
black
and
white
she
had
jolly
brown
eyes
and
a
dimple
in
the
middle
of
her
chin
she
was
ready
to
discuss
any
question
with
any
one
was
marvellously
and
tolerant
and
although
she
was
both
poor
and
generous
always
succeeded
in
making
her
little
flat
in
soho
square
pretty
and
attractive
her
chief
fault
perhaps
was
that
she
cared
for
no
one
especially
she
had
neither
lovers
nor
parents
nor
sisters
nor
brothers
and
to
all
her
friends
she
behaved
with
the
same
kind
geniality
welcoming
one
as
another
she
was
thus
aloof
from
them
all
and
relied
upon
no
one
the
centre
of
her
life
was
of
course
her
religion
but
of
this
she
never
spoke
although
strangely
enough
no
one
doubted
the
intensity
of
her
belief
and
the
reality
of
her
devotion
she
was
a
determined
follower
of
warlock
what
he
said
she
believed
but
here
too
there
seemed
to
be
no
personal
attachment
she
did
not
allow
criticism
of
him
in
her
own
presence
but
on
the
other
hand
she
never
spoke
as
though
it
would
distress
her
very
greatly
to
lose
him
he
was
a
sign
a
symbol
if
one
symbol
went
another
could
be
found
to
martin
she
was
the
one
proof
of
the
reality
of
the
chapel
all
the
others
his
sister
miss
avies
thurston
crashaw
the
miss
cardinals
yes
and
his
father
too
were
in
one
way
or
another
eccentric
abnormal
but
miss
pyncheon
was
the
sane
world
the
worldly
world
the
world
of
drinks
and
dinners
and
banks
and
tobacconists
and
yet
she
believed
as
profoundly
as
any
of
them
what
did
she
believe
she
was
an
inside
saint
therefore
she
must
have
accepted
this
whole
story
of
the
second
coming
and
the
rest
of
it
of
course
women
would
believe
anything
nevertheless
he
scarcely
listened
to
their
chatter
he
was
forcing
himself
not
to
look
at
his
sister
and
yet
thurston
news
seemed
so
extraordinary
to
him
that
his
eye
kept
stealing
round
to
her
to
see
whether
she
were
still
the
same
could
she
have
accepted
him
that
bounder
and
cad
and
charlatan
he
felt
a
sudden
cold
chill
of
isolation
as
though
in
this
world
none
of
the
ordinary
laws
were
followed
by
god
i
am
a
stranger
here
he
thought
it
was
not
until
after
dinner
that
night
that
he
was
alone
with
his
father
he
had
resolved
on
many
fine
things
in
the
interval
he
was
going
to
have
it
out
with
him
to
put
his
foot
down
to
tell
him
that
such
a
thing
as
thurston
marriage
to
his
sister
was
perfectly
impossible
and
then
for
the
thousandth
time
since
his
return
to
england
he
felt
strangely
weak
and
irresolute
he
did
wish
to
be
firm
with
his
father
but
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
be
firm
had
he
not
been
so
fond
of
him
soft
sentimental
weakness
he
called
it
to
himself
but
he
knew
that
it
was
something
deeper
than
that
something
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
deny
he
went
into
his
father
study
that
night
with
a
strange
dismal
foreboding
as
though
he
were
being
drawn
along
upon
some
path
that
he
did
not
want
to
follow
what
was
his
father
mixed
up
with
all
this
business
for
why
were
such
men
as
thurston
in
existence
why
life
be
simple
and
straightforward
with
people
like
his
father
and
himself
and
that
girl
maggie
alone
somewhere
with
nothing
to
interfere
life
was
never
just
as
you
wanted
it
always
a
little
askew
a
little
twisted
cynically
cocking
its
eye
at
you
before
it
vanished
round
the
corner
he
did
seem
to
be
able
to
manage
it
anyway
he
was
going
to
have
that
fellow
thurston
marrying
his
sister
he
found
his
father
lying
back
in
his
fast
asleep
looking
like
a
dead
man
his
long
thin
face
pale
with
fatigue
his
eyelids
a
dull
grey
his
mouth
tightly
closed
as
though
in
a
grim
determination
to
pursue
some
battle
and
at
the
sight
of
him
thus
worn
out
and
beaten
martin
affection
flooded
his
heart
he
stood
opposite
his
father
looking
at
him
and
loving
him
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
done
before
i
will
take
him
away
from
all
this
was
his
thought
these
thurstons
and
all
out
of
all
this
we
go
off
abroad
somewhere
and
make
him
fat
and
happy
then
his
father
suddenly
woke
up
with
a
start
and
a
cry
where
am
i
then
he
suddenly
saw
martin
martin
he
said
smiling
martin
smiled
back
and
then
began
at
once
father
this
is
true
about
thurston
is
it
he
saw
as
he
had
often
done
before
that
his
father
had
to
call
himself
up
from
some
world
of
vision
before
he
could
realise
even
his
surroundings
martin
he
recognised
intuitively
with
the
recognition
of
the
spirit
but
he
seemed
to
take
in
the
details
of
the
room
slowly
one
by
one
as
though
blinded
by
the
light
ah
i
been
dreaming
he
said
still
smiling
at
martin
helplessly
and
almost
timidly
i
so
tired
these
days
suddenly
i
use
to
be
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
then
laid
it
on
martin
knee
and
the
strength
and
warmth
of
that
seemed
suddenly
to
fill
him
with
vigour
you
never
tired
are
you
he
asked
as
a
child
might
ask
an
elder
very
seldom
answered
martin
i
say
father
what
is
all
this
about
thurston
thurston
why
what
he
been
doing
he
says
he
engaged
to
amy
the
disgust
of
the
idea
made
words
against
his
will
sharp
and
angry
does
he
yes
i
remember
he
spoke
to
me
about
it
of
course
it
simply
his
infernal
cheek
warlock
sighed
i
do
know
i
sure
amy
seemed
to
wish
it
martin
felt
then
more
strongly
than
before
the
something
that
drove
him
it
said
to
him
now
then
here
a
thing
for
you
to
make
a
row
about
a
big
row
and
then
you
can
go
off
with
maggie
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
something
that
said
do
hurt
him
do
hurt
him
you
may
regret
it
all
your
life
if
if
what
he
did
know
he
was
always
threatened
with
regretting
things
all
his
life
the
blow
was
always
going
to
fall
and
that
pleasant
very
british
phrase
came
back
to
him
he
would
put
his
foot
down
however
he
was
very
angry
very
angry
he
burst
out
oh
but
that
absurd
father
impossible
utterly
thurston
in
the
family
why
you
must
see
yourself
how
monstrous
it
would
be
amy
got
some
silly
sentimental
whim
and
she
got
to
be
told
that
it
wo
do
if
you
ask
me
i
do
think
amy
improved
much
since
i
was
away
but
that
not
the
question
the
idea
of
disgusting
you
ca
seriously
consider
it
for
a
minute
why
is
thurston
disgusting
my
boy
martin
hated
to
be
called
my
boy
it
made
him
feel
so
young
and
dependent
you
only
got
to
look
at
him
martin
jumped
up
disregarding
his
father
hand
and
began
to
stamp
about
the
room
he
a
cad
he
not
your
friend
father
he
is
really
he
like
to
out
you
from
the
whole
thing
if
he
could
he
thinks
you
and
behind
the
times
and
all
he
thinks
about
is
bringing
in
subscriptions
and
collecting
new
converts
he
like
one
of
those
men
who
beat
drums
outside
tents
in
a
fair
he
a
sickening
man
he
does
believe
in
his
religion
or
anything
else
i
should
think
he
crooked
about
money
and
immoral
probably
too
you
much
too
innocent
father
you
so
good
and
trustful
yourself
that
you
do
know
how
these
fellows
are
doing
you
in
there
a
regular
plot
against
you
and
they
be
most
awfully
pleased
if
you
were
to
retire
they
not
genuine
like
you
they
simply
use
the
chapel
for
and
making
money
of
course
there
are
some
genuine
ones
like
the
miss
cardinals
but
thurston
an
absolute
swindler
he
stopped
short
at
that
he
had
said
more
than
he
had
intended
and
he
was
frightened
suddenly
he
swung
round
on
his
heel
and
looked
at
his
father
come
here
martin
he
came
across
the
room
closer
now
tell
me
we
good
friends
are
we
of
course
father
he
put
his
hand
on
his
son
shoulder
do
you
know
that
i
love
you
more
than
anything
in
the
whole
world

terribly
afraid

ca
help
myself

love
you
martin
so
that

like
hunger
or
thirst

the
only
earthly
passion

and
i
tell
you
another
thing

the
one
terror
of
my
earthly
life
that

now
that
i
got
you
back
afraid
every
time

go
out
of
the
house

the
corner
and

i

you
and
i

to

time

though
amy
married
a
hundred
thurstons
warlock
grip
on
his
son
shoulder
was
iron
martin
bent
down
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
dusty
leather
chair
to
bring
himself
on
to
the
same
level
he
put
his
arm
round
his
father
and
drew
him
close
to
him
maggie
life
money
adventure
everything
seemed
to
draw
away
from
him
and
he
saw
himself
a
little
boy
pattering
on
bare
feet
down
the
aisle
towards
the
font
just
as
though
a
spell
had
been
cast
over
him
they
sat
close
together
in
silence
then
slowly
the
thought
of
thurston
came
back
again
martin
drew
away
a
little
all
the
same
father
he
said
thurston
must
marry
amy
they
only
engaged
there
no
question
of
marriage
yet
then
they
are
engaged
martin
drew
right
away
standing
up
again
oh
yes
they
engaged
then
i
not
going
to
stand
it
i
tell
you
i
wo
stay
here
if
thurston
marries
amy
warlock
sighed
well
then
let
leave
it
my
boy
i
daresay
they
never
marry
no
i
wo
have
it
it
too
serious
to
leave
his
father
voice
was
sharper
suddenly
well
we
wo
talk
about
it
just
now
martin
if
you
do
mind
but
i
must
you
ca
leave
a
thing
like
that
thurston
will
simply
own
the
place
i
tell
you
martin
to
leave
it
alone
they
were
both
angry
now
and
i
tell
you
father
that
if
you
let
thurston
marry
amy
i
leave
the
house
and
never
come
back
again
is
that
rather
selfish
of
you
you
been
away
all
these
years
you
left
us
to
ourselves
you
come
back
suddenly
without
seeing
how
we
live
or
caring
and
then
you
dictate
to
us
what
we
to
do
how
can
you
expect
us
to
listen
and
how
can
you
expect
me
to
stay
martin
broke
into
a
torrent
of
words
i
miserable
here
and
you
know
that
i
am
mother
and
amy
hate
me
and
you
always
wrapped
up
in
your
religion
what
kind
of
a
place
is
it
for
a
fellow
i
came
back
meaning
that
you
and
i
should
be
the
best
pals
father
and
son
have
ever
been
but
you
would
come
out
with
me
you
only
wanted
to
drag
me
in
you
tell
me
always
to
wait
for
something
to
wait
for
what
i
do
know
and
nobody
here
does
seem
to
know
and
i
ca
wait
for
ever
i
got
to
lead
my
own
life
and
if
you
wo
come
with
me
i
must
go
off
by
myself
he
was
following
his
own
ideas
now
not
looking
at
his
father
at
all
i
discovered
since
i
been
home
that
i
not
the
sort
of
fellow
to
settle
down
i
suppose
i
shall
go
on
wandering
about
all
my
days
i
not
proud
of
myself
you
know
father
i
do
seem
to
be
much
good
to
any
one
but
the
trouble
is
i
do
want
to
be
much
better
i
feel
as
though
it
would
be
much
good
if
i
did
try
i
ca
give
up
my
own
life
for
nobody
not
even
for
you
and
however
rotten
my
own
life
is
i
rather
lead
it
than
some
one
else
he
stopped
and
then
went
on
quietly
as
though
he
were
arguing
something
out
with
himself
the
strange
thing
is
that
i
do
feel
this
place
has
got
a
kind
of
a
hold
on
me
when
you
remind
me
of
what
i
was
like
as
a
kid
i
go
right
back
and
feel
helpless
as
though
you
could
do
anything
with
me
you
like
all
the
same
i
do
believe
in
this
business
father
all
this
second
coming
and
the
rest
of
it
we
in
the
twentieth
century
now
you
know
and
everybody
knows
that
that
kind
of
thing
is
simply
impossible
only
an
old
maid
or
two
why
i
believe
you
believe
in
it
really
father
that
why
you
so
keen
on
making
me
believe
but
i
do
it
no
use
you
ca
make
me
i
believe
there
any
god
at
all
if
there
were
a
god
he
let
a
fellow
have
more
free
will
he
was
interrupted
by
an
extraordinary
cry
he
turned
to
see
his
father
standing
one
hand
pressed
back
on
the
chair
his
face
white
his
eyes
black
and
empty
like
sightless
eyes
martin
that
blasphemy
take
care
take
care
oh
my
son
my
son
then
he
suddenly
collapsed
backwards
crouching
on
to
the
chair
as
though
he
were
trying
to
flee
from
some
danger
martin
sprang
towards
him
he
caught
him
round
the
body
holding
him
to
him
something
was
leaping
like
a
furious
animal
inside
his
father
breast
what
is
it
he
cried
desperately
frightened
it
my
heart
warlock
answered
in
a
voice
very
soft
and
distant
bad
excitement
ring
that
bell
amy
a
moment
later
amy
entered
she
came
quickly
into
the
room
she
said
nothing
only
gave
martin
one
look
she
gave
her
father
something
from
a
little
bottle
kneeling
in
front
of
him
at
last
she
turned
to
her
brother
you
better
go
she
said
you
can
do
nothing
here
miserable
repentant
feeling
as
though
he
had
no
place
in
the
world
and
yet
eager
too
to
defend
himself
he
left
the
room
chapter
vii
the
outside
world
maggie
had
a
week
she
did
not
need
it
from
the
first
after
martin
leaving
her
her
mind
was
made
up
this
question
of
marriage
did
not
on
further
reflection
very
greatly
disturb
her
she
had
known
in
her
time
a
number
of
married
people
and
they
had
been
invariably
unhappy
and
quarrelsome
the
point
seemed
to
be
that
you
should
be
in
some
way
near
the
person
whom
you
loved
and
she
had
only
loved
one
person
in
all
her
life
and
intended
never
to
love
another
even
this
question
of
love
was
not
nearly
so
tangled
for
her
as
it
would
be
for
any
more
civilised
person
she
knew
very
little
about
marriage
and
only
in
the
most
sordid
fashion
about
sexual
relations
which
were
definitely
connected
in
her
mind
with
drunken
peasants
and
her
father
cook
they
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
martin
the
opinion
of
the
world
was
an
unknown
factor
in
her
vision
she
only
knew
of
the
opinion
of
her
aunts
and
miss
warlock
and
with
these
she
was
already
in
rebellion
she
would
have
been
in
great
trouble
had
she
supposed
that
this
woman
still
loved
martin
and
needed
him
but
that
from
what
martin
had
said
was
obviously
not
so
no
it
was
all
quite
clear
they
would
escape
together
out
of
this
tangle
of
unnatural
mysteries
and
warnings
and
live
happily
for
ever
after
in
the
country
as
to
martin
that
did
not
greatly
distress
her
she
had
never
supposed
that
he
or
any
one
else
was
good
she
had
never
known
a
good
person
nor
did
it
occur
to
her
in
her
pristine
state
of
savagery
that
you
loved
any
one
the
less
for
their
drawbacks
she
would
rather
be
with
martin
at
his
worst
than
with
any
one
else
at
their
best
that
was
all
was
enough
time
to
settle
the
whole
affair
she
then
waited
patiently
until
the
end
of
the
week
she
did
not
quite
know
how
she
would
arrange
a
meeting
but
that
would
she
expected
arrange
itself
two
events
occurred
that
filled
her
mind
and
made
the
week
pass
quickly
one
was
that
she
received
an
answer
to
her
adventurous
letter
the
other
was
a
remarkable
conversation
with
miss
caroline
smith
the
answer
to
her
letter
was
lying
on
her
plate
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
and
aunt
elizabeth
was
watching
it
with
an
excited
stare
it
read
as
follows
bryanston
square
dear
miss
cardinal
of
course
i
remember
you
perfectly
i
wondered
whether
you
would
write
to
me
one
day
i
am
married
now
and
live
most
of
the
year
in
london
would
you
come
and
see
me
at
bryanston
square
i
am
nearly
always
at
home
at
if
you
are
free
would
you
perhaps
come
next
friday
it
will
be
so
nice
to
see
you
again
yours
sincerely
katherine
mark
you
got
a
letter
dear
your
aunt
is
quite
so
well
this
morning
i
afraid
scrambled
eggs
yes
she
looked
her
aunt
in
the
face
without
any
confusion
how
strangely
her
decision
about
martin
had
altered
her
relationship
now
to
every
one
what
did
it
matter
whether
any
one
were
angry
i
ought
to
have
told
you
aunt
elizabeth
i
wrote
about
a
fortnight
ago
to
a
lady
who
came
once
to
see
us
at
home
she
was
a
miss
trenchard
then
she
said
that
if
ever
i
wanted
any
help
i
was
to
write
to
her
so
i
have
written
to
ask
her
whether
she
can
find
me
any
work
to
do
and
she
has
asked
me
to
go
and
see
her
work
said
aunt
elizabeth
but
you
wo
go
away
while
your
so
would
she
maggie
did
know
so
much
about
that
i
want
to
be
independent
said
maggie
trying
to
fix
aunt
eyes
it
is
fair
that
i
should
be
a
burden
to
you
you
no
burden
dear
aunt
elizabeth
looked
uneasily
round
the
room
your
aunt
depends
on
you
depends
on
me
for
what
for
everything
then
she
ought
to
aunt
elizabeth
i
said
it
again
and
again
i
not
fit
for
any
one
to
depend
on
i
forgetful
and
careless
and
untidy
you
know
i
am
and
i
different
from
every
one
here
i
very
grateful
to
aunt
anne
but
i
not
good
enough
for
her
to
depend
on
aunt
elizabeth
blinked
nervously
she
got
very
little
you
must
take
away
all
she
has
i
not
all
she
has
answered
maggie
knowing
that
she
was
becoming
excited
and
cross
i
do
belong
to
any
one
except
myself
and
martin
her
soul
whispered
then
she
added
suddenly
moved
by
remorse
as
she
looked
at
aunt
elizabeth
meek
and
trembling
face
you
so
good
to
me
both
of
you
and
i
so
bad
i
give
you
anything
but
my
freedom
you
talk
so
strangely
dear
said
aunt
elizabeth
but
there
are
so
many
things
i
do
understand
maggie
took
the
letter
up
to
her
bedroom
and
there
read
it
a
number
of
times
it
all
seemed
wonderful
to
her
the
stamped
blue
address
the
rich
white
square
notepaper
and
above
all
the
beautiful
handwriting
she
thought
of
her
own
childish
scrawl
and
blushed
she
even
sat
down
there
and
then
at
her
and
with
a
pencil
began
to
imitate
some
of
the
letters
on
friday
was
tuesday
bryanston
square
wherever
was
bryanston
square
and
how
would
she
find
it
she
determined
to
ask
caroline
smith
she
had
not
long
to
wait
for
her
opportunity
on
wednesday
evening
about
five
miss
smith
poked
her
head
into
the
cardinal
to
discover
maggie
sitting
with
her
hands
on
her
lap
looking
down
on
to
the
street
are
your
aunts
anywhere
asked
caroline
no
said
maggie
aunt
anne
in
bed
and
aunt
elizabeth
at
miss
pyncheon
that
right
said
caroline
because
i
have
seen
you
darling
for
ages
the
day
before
yesterday
said
maggie
you
a
literal
pet
said
caroline
kissing
her
i
always
exaggerate
of
course
and
it
so
sweet
of
you
to
tell
me
about
it
she
rushed
off
to
the
fire
and
spread
out
her
blue
skirt
and
dangled
her
feet
is
it
cold
and
dark
you
funny
dear
not
to
have
the
blinds
down
and
to
sit
staring
into
the
beastly
street
like
that
i
believe
you
in
love
maggie
came
to
herself
with
a
start
got
up
and
slowly
went
over
to
the
fire
caroline
where
bryanston
square
oh
you
pet
do
you
know
where
bryanston
square
is
cried
caroline
suddenly
fixing
her
bright
eyes
upon
maggie
with
burning
curiosity
if
i
did
i
would
ask
said
maggie
quite
right
neither
you
would
well
it
near
marble
arch
but
i
do
know
where
the
marble
arch
is
lord
cried
caroline
and
she
been
in
london
for
months
you
really
are
a
pet
well
what
you
better
do
is
to
get
into
the
first
taxi
you
see
and
just
say
square
how
stupid
of
her
she
might
have
thought
of
that
for
herself
is
there
a
park
near
bryanston
square
she
asked
yes
of
course
hyde
park
and
is
it
open
at
six
of
course
you
ca
shut
hyde
park
oh
maggie
pursued
her
thoughts
caroline
watched
her
with
intense
curiosity
what
do
you
want
with
a
park
you
darling
she
asked
at
last
oh
nothing
said
maggie
slowly
then
she
went
on
laughing
been
asked
out
to
tea
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
i
terribly
frightened
how
exciting
said
caroline
clapping
her
hands
who
it
with
it
a
mark
she
was
a
miss
trenchard
she
used
to
live
in
glebeshire
she
going
to
find
me
some
work
to
do
work
cried
caroline
are
you
going
to
stay
with
your
aunts
then
i
want
to
be
independent
said
maggie
slowly
well
said
caroline
amazed
could
maggie
have
seen
just
then
into
miss
smith
mind
and
could
she
only
have
realised
that
with
miss
smith
every
action
and
intention
in
the
human
heart
pivoted
upon
and
only
she
might
have
been
warned
and
have
saved
much
later
trouble
she
was
intent
on
her
own
plans
and
was
thinking
of
caroline
only
as
a
possible
agent
caroline
she
asked
would
you
take
a
note
for
me
to
some
one
of
course
said
caroline
who
is
it
martin
warlock
said
maggie
at
the
name
she
suddenly
blushed
crimson
she
knew
that
caroline
was
looking
at
her
with
eager
curiosity
she
suspected
then
that
she
had
done
something
foolish
and
would
have
given
anything
to
recall
her
words
but
to
recall
them
now
seemed
only
to
make
it
the
more
suspicious
it
only
something
his
sister
wanted
to
know
she
said
casually
i
thought
you
be
seeing
him
soon
i
hardly
ever
do
yes
i
going
up
there
said
caroline
staring
at
maggie
well
i
give
it
you
before
you
go
then
she
went
on
as
casually
as
she
could
what
been
happening
lately
of
course
you
know
all
about
the
excitement
said
caroline
sitting
back
in
the
faded
with
her
blue
dress
spread
all
about
her
like
a
cloud
what
excitement
said
maggie
pulling
herself
up
with
a
desperate
struggle
from
her
own
private
adventures
what
you
do
know
caroline
exclaimed
in
an
awed
whisper
know
what
maggie
asked
rather
crossly
repenting
more
and
more
of
asking
caroline
to
carry
her
note
why
where
do
you
live
all
about
warlock
and
his
visions
i
heard
nothing
at
all
said
maggie
this
was
unexpected
joy
to
caroline
who
had
never
imagined
that
there
would
be
any
one
so
near
the
inner
saints
as
maggie
who
yet
knew
nothing
about
these
recent
events
do
you
really
know
nothing
about
it
nothing
said
maggie
are
you
wonderful
said
caroline
what
happened
was
this
about
three
weeks
ago
warlock
had
a
vision
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
saw
god
at
about
three
in
the
morning
how
did
he
see
god
asked
maggie
awed
in
spite
of
herself
caroline
voice
dropped
to
a
mysterious
whisper
he
just
woke
up
and
there
god
was
at
the
end
of
the
bed
of
course
he
not
spoken
to
me
about
it
but
apparently
there
was
a
blaze
of
light
and
something
in
the
middle
and
then
a
voice
spoke
and
told
warlock
that
on
the
last
night
of
this
year
everything
would
be
fulfilled
what
did
he
mean
asked
maggie
different
people
think
he
meant
different
things
said
caroline
of
course
there
most
fearful
excitement
about
it
warlock
had
two
since
two
what
asked
maggie
two
visions
just
like
the
first
the
blazing
light
and
the
voice
and
telling
him
that
the
last
night
of
the
year
to
be
the
time
caroline
then
began
to
be
carried
away
by
her
excitement
she
talked
faster
and
faster
oh
you
do
know
what
a
state
every
one
in
it
causing
all
sorts
of
divisions
first
there
are
all
his
own
real
believers
miss
pyncheon
your
aunts
and
the
others
my
father
one
they
all
believe
every
word
he
says
they
all
quite
certain
that
the
last
day
of
this
year
is
to
be
the
time
of
the
second
coming
they
wo
any
of
them
look
a
minute
further
than
that
father
does
care
a
bit
now
what
mother
does
with
the
money
because
he
says
we
sha
want
any
next
year
mother
is
so
sure
so
she
taking
as
much
care
of
it
as
ever
and
of
course
it
nice
for
her
now
to
have
it
all
in
her
own
hands
they
all
of
them
doing
everything
to
make
themselves
ready
it
does
matter
how
aggravating
you

loses
his
temper

it
maddening
have
you
noticed
how
good
your
aunts

the
same

different
really
then
there
the
like
thurston
and
miss
avies
who
pretend
to
believe
all
that
warlock
says
but
of
course
they
do
believe
a
word
of
it
and
they
hope
that
this
will
prove
his
ruin
they
know
there
wo
be
any
second
coming
on
new
year
eve
and
then
they
think
he
will
be
finished
and
they
be
able
to
get
rid
of
him
so
they
encouraging
him
to
believe
in
all
this
and
then
when
the
moment
comes
they
turn
on
him
beasts
said
maggie
suddenly
well
i
daresay
you
right
said
caroline
only
it
does
make
me
laugh

of
it
thurston
and
miss
avies

all
their
plans
made

miss
avies
meant
him
to
marry

to
marry
miss

cried
maggie
so
they
say
said
caroline
again
watching
maggie
curiously
well
anyway
miss
avies
is
the
strongest
of
the
lot
really
i
back
her
against
anybody
i
terrified
of
her
myself
i
tell
you
frankly
wring
any
one
neck
for
twopence
oh

would
then
there
are
the
third
lot
who
simply
do
believe
in
warlock
visions
at
all
and
just
laugh
at
him
people
like
miss
smythe
and
bellaston
a
lot
of
them
are
leaving
the
chapel
warlock
wo
listen
to
anybody
he
getting
stranger
and
stranger
and
his
heart
so
bad
they
say
he
might
die
any
day
if
he
had
a
shock
then
he
always
quarrelling
with
martin
caroline
suddenly
stopped
she
looked
at
maggie
martin
a
terrible
trial
to
his
father
she
said
but
maggie
was
secure
now
is
he
she
asked
indifferently
then
she
added
slowly
what
do
you
believe
caroline
what
do
i
believe
yes
about
warlock
visions
oh
of
course
it
only
because
he
ill
and
prays
for
hours
without
getting
off
his
knees
and
wo
eat
enough
that
he
sees
things
and
yet
i
do
know
there
may
be
something
in
it
if
i
were
on
my
knees
for
weeks
i
never
see
anything
but
i
be
terribly
sorry
for
warlock
if
the
time
comes
and
nothing
happens
he
just
have
to
go
they
sat
a
little
longer
together
and
then
caroline
said
well
darling
i
must
be
off
where
that
note
she
hesitated
looking
at
maggie
with
a
wicked
gleam
in
her
pale
blue
eyes
you
know
maggie
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
i
had
an
offer
of
marriage
i
so
glad
caroline
said
maggie
yes
but
i
do
know
what
to
do
it
a
man
purdie
his
ever
so
rich
and
they
got
a
big
place
down
at
skeaton
where
that
asked
maggie
oh
do
you
know
it
a
seaside
resort
i
known
william
for
a
long
time
his
father
knows
father
he
came
to
tea
last
week
and
proposed
he
rather
nice
although
he
so
silent
why
do
you
marry
him
then
asked
maggie
well
i
know
martin
warlock
going
to
ask
me
it
been
getting
closer
and
closer
i
expect
he
will
this
week
of
course
he
is
so
safe
as
william
but
he
much
more
exciting
and
he
got
quite
a
lot
of
money
of
his
own
strange
the
sure
confident
happy
security
that
maggie
felt
in
her
heart
at
this
announcement
i
should
wait
for
martin
warlock
she
said
he
be
rather
fun
to
marry
do
you
think
so
answered
caroline
do
you
know
i
believe
i
will
you
always
right
you
darling
only
suppose
i
should
miss
them
both
william
wo
wait
for
ever
got
that
note
dear
maggie
was
defiant
she
would
just
show
the
creature
that
she
afraid
of
her
she
give
her
the
note
and
she
might
imagine
what
she
pleased
she
got
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
hurriedly
the
week
is
up
on
friday
will
you
meet
me
that
evening
at
a
quarter
past
six
under
the
marble
arch
maggie
the
boldness
the
excitement
of
this
inflamed
her
it
was
so
like
her
to
challenge
any
action
once
she
was
in
it
by
taking
it
to
its
furthest
limit
she
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
wrote
martin
name
with
a
flourish
there
she
said
giving
it
to
caroline
thank
you
said
caroline
and
with
a
number
of
rather
wet
and
elaborate
kisses
maggie
hated
kissing
departed
but
her
afternoon
was
not
yet
over
hardly
had
caroline
left
when
the
door
was
opened
and
miss
avies
was
shown
in
maggie
started
up
with
dismay
and
began
to
stammer
excuses
miss
avies
brushed
them
aside
it
does
matter
she
said
you
do
as
well
even
it
may
be
better
a
strange
woman
miss
avies
maggie
had
of
course
seen
her
at
chapel
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
been
alone
together
miss
avies
was
like
a
thin
rod
of
black
metal
erect
and
quivering
and
waiting
to
strike
her
long
sallow
face
was
stiff
not
with
outraged
virtue
or
elaborate
pride
or
burning
scorn
but
simply
with
the
accumulated
concentration
of
fiery
determination
she
was
the
very
symbol
of
energy
inhuman
cold
relentless
her
hair
was
jet
black
and
gleamed
like
steel
and
she
had
thick
black
eyebrows
like
against
her
forehead
of
parchment
her
eyes
were
dead
like
glass
eyes
and
she
had
some
false
teeth
that
sometimes
clicked
in
her
mouth
she
wore
a
black
dress
with
no
ornament
and
thin
black
gloves
she
did
not
seem
however
to
maggie
unkindly
as
she
stood
there
looking
about
the
room
rather
she
would
not
wear
glasses
could
it
have
been
vanity
she
was
not
hostile
nor
scornful
nor
even
patronising
but
had
maggie
been
struck
there
dead
at
her
feet
she
would
not
have
moved
a
step
to
help
her
her
voice
was
ugly
with
a
crack
in
it
as
though
it
needed
oil
maggie
as
she
looked
at
her
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
she
did
not
believe
in
mysticism
she
came
across
and
shook
maggie
hand
her
touch
was
cold
and
stiff
and
a
little
damp
like
that
of
a
wet
stone
sorry
your
aunt
out
she
said
but
i
can
talk
to
you
for
a
while
she
looked
at
maggie
for
a
moment
then
she
said
why
do
you
clear
out
of
all
this
the
voice
was
so
abrupt
and
the
words
so
unexpected
that
maggie
jumped
why
do
i
she
repeated
yes
you
said
miss
avies
you
no
place
here
in
all
this
business
you
do
believe
in
it
do
you
no
said
maggie
and
you
do
want
to
use
it
for
something
you
do
believe
in
no
said
maggie
well
then
clear
out
maggie
colouring
a
little
said
my
aunts
have
been
very
good
to
me
i
ought
to
leave
them
fiddlesticks
said
miss
avies
your
life
your
own
not
your
aunts
she
sat
down
and
stayed
bolt
upright
and
motionless
near
the
fire
she
flung
a
thin
dark
shadow
like
a
stain
on
the
wall
there
was
a
long
pause
between
them
after
that
abrupt
opening
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
say
maggie
thoughts
also
were
elsewhere
she
was
wishing
now
passionately
that
she
had
not
given
that
note
to
caroline
suddenly
miss
avies
said
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
all
day
maggie
laughed
try
and
make
myself
less
careless
miss
avies
miss
avies
replied
you
never
make
yourself
less
careless
we
are
as
we
are
but
do
you
think
said
maggie
that
one
can
cure
one
faults
one
gets
rid
of
one
only
to
make
room
for
another
but
that
matter
the
point
is
that
one
should
have
an
ambition
what
your
ambition
child
maggie
did
answer
her
ambition
was
martin
but
she
could
tell
miss
avies
so
at
last
after
a
long
pause
as
miss
avies
still
seemed
to
be
waiting
she
answered
i
suppose
that
i
want
to
earn
my
living
to
be
independent
well
leave
this
place
then
said
miss
avies
there
no
independence
here
then
added
as
though
to
herself
they
think
they
looking
for
the
face
of
god
it
only
for
themselves
and
their
vanity
they
looking
maggie
said
to
break
another
of
the
long
pauses
that
seemed
to
be
always
forming
between
them
i
think
every
one
ought
to
earn
their
own
living
do
you
miss
avies
shook
her
head
you
very
young
terribly
young
i
got
no
advice
to
give
you
except
to
lead
a
healthy
life
somewhere
away
from
these
surroundings
we
an
unnatural
lot
here
and
you
a
healthy
young
creature
have
you
got
a
lover
maggie
smiled
i
got
a
friend
she
said
miss
avies
sighed
that
more
than
i
got
she
said
not
that
i
time
for
one
she
added
she
got
up
i
wo
wait
for
your
aunt
she
said
i
left
a
note
downstairs
you
clear
out
as
soon
as
you
can
that
my
advice
to
you
she
said
looking
into
maggie
clear
eyes
she
was
suddenly
less
inhuman
the
touch
of
her
hand
was
warmer
do
you
cheat
yourself
into
believing
in
the
deity
she
said
and
was
gone
when
friday
arrived
maggie
had
not
seen
caroline
again
and
she
could
not
tell
whether
the
note
had
been
safely
delivered
or
no
she
was
not
sure
what
she
had
better
do
caroline
might
hare
done
anything
with
the
note
torn
it
up
burnt
it
lost
it
forgotten
it
altogether
well
that
was
a
risk
that
maggie
must
take
if
he
did
not
appear
she
would
wait
a
little
while
and
then
come
away
they
must
soon
meet
in
any
case
they
had
all
their
lives
before
them
aunt
anne
was
up
again
very
very
pale
now
and
so
thin
that
the
light
seemed
to
shine
through
her
making
her
more
of
a
stained
window
saint
than
ever
maggie
told
her
about
the
visit
aunt
anne
looked
at
her
curiously
she
seemed
so
weak
and
frail
that
maggie
suddenly
felt
warm
maternal
love
rather
shyly
she
put
her
hand
upon
her
aunt
i
wo
go
away
until
you
better
aunt
anne
nodded
her
head
i
know
you
wo
dear
she
said
do
be
out
late
we
shall
be
anxious
about
you
maggie
had
made
a
promise
and
was
terrified
when
she
thought
of
it
suppose
her
aunt
did
not
get
better
for
years
and
years
people
often
had
long
lingering
illnesses
with
no
apparent
change
in
their
condition
to
maggie
a
promise
was
an
utterly
final
thing
she
could
not
dream
that
one
ever
broke
one
word
she
trembled
now
when
she
thought
of
what
she
had
done
she
had
been
entrapped
after
all
and
by
her
own
free
will
in
her
little
room
as
she
was
putting
on
her
hat
she
suddenly
prayed
to
a
god
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
that
her
aunt
might
get
better
soon
she
started
out
on
her
great
adventure
with
a
strange
as
though
loving
martin
had
given
her
the
wisdom
of
all
the
ages
turning
down
the
street
towards
the
strand
she
found
almost
at
once
a
drawn
up
as
though
it
had
been
waiting
there
especially
for
her
like
an
eloping
coach
in
a
romantic
tale
a
fat
fellow
with
a
purple
nose
a
cloth
cap
and
a
familiar
vague
eye
as
though
he
always
saw
further
than
he
intended
waited
patiently
for
her
to
speak
boldly
as
though
she
had
done
such
things
all
her
life
she
said
fourteen
bryanston
square
then
she
slipped
in
and
was
hidden
from
the
gay
world
she
sat
there
her
hands
on
her
lap
staring
at
the
three
crimson
rolls
in
the
neck
of
her
driver
she
was
thinking
of
nothing
nothing
at
all
did
she
struggle
to
think
only
words
would
come
martin
or
bryanston
square
or
cab
again
and
again
words
that
did
not
mean
anything
but
physical
sensations
martin
hot
fire
at
the
throat
bryanston
square
an
iron
rod
down
the
spine
and
cab
dust
and
ashes
in
the
eyes
she
tried
to
look
at
herself
in
the
little
mirror
opposite
her
but
she
could
only
catch
the
corner
of
her
cheek
and
half
her
hat
but
she
minded
less
about
her
appearance
now
if
martin
could
love
her
it
did
not
matter
what
others
thought
nevertheless
she
pulled
her
hat
about
a
little
and
patted
her
dress
the
cab
stopped
and
she
felt
desperately
lonely
did
any
one
care
about
her
anywhere
no
no
one
she
could
have
cried
with
pity
at
the
thought
of
her
own
loneliness
one
and
sixpence
miss
said
the
cabman
in
so
husky
a
voice
she
gave
it
to
him
what
this
he
asked
looking
at
it
one
and
sixpence
she
answered
timidly
wondering
at
his
sarcastic
eye
oh
well
o
course
he
said
looking
her
all
over
she
knew
instinctively
that
he
demanded
more
she
found
another
sixpence
is
that
enough
she
asked
he
seemed
ashamed
if
i
a
wife
sick
he
began
she
ran
up
the
high
stone
steps
and
rang
a
bell
the
episode
with
the
driver
had
disturbed
her
terribly
it
had
shown
in
what
a
foreign
world
she
was
all
her
was
gone
she
had
to
take
a
pull
at
herself
and
say
why
maggie
you
might
be
ringing
the
dentist
bell
at
this
moment
that
helped
her
and
then
the
thought
of
martin
she
saw
his
boyish
smile
and
felt
the
warm
touch
of
his
rough
hand
when
the
maid
was
there
instead
of
the
green
door
she
almost
said
is
martin
in
but
she
behaved
very
well
mrs
mark
she
said
in
precisely
the
voice
required
the
maid
smiled
and
stood
aside
and
then
into
what
a
world
she
entered
a
world
of
comfort
and
reassurance
of
homeliness
and
kindliness
without
parrots
and
cats
and
swaying
pictures
of
armoured
men
a
world
of
urbanity
and
light
and
space
there
was
a
high
white
staircase
with
brown
etchings
in
dark
frames
on
the
white
walls
there
was
a
thick
soft
carpet
and
a
friendly
fat
grandfather
clock
many
doors
but
none
of
them
mysterious
all
ready
to
be
opened
she
climbed
the
staircase
and
was
shown
into
a
room
high
and
gaily
coloured
and
full
of
flowers
she
saw
the
deep
curtains
blue
silk
shot
with
purple
the
chairs
of
blue
silk
and
a
bowl
of
soft
amber
light
hanging
from
the
ceiling
a
mass
of
chrysanthemums
flamed
against
the
curtains
several
people
were
gathered
round
a
near
the
fire
she
stood
lost
on
the
thick
purple
carpet
under
the
amber
light
all
too
brilliant
for
her
she
had
come
from
a
world
of
darkness
she
must
blink
before
the
blaze
some
one
came
forward
to
her
some
one
so
kind
and
comforting
so
easy
and
unsurprised
that
maggie
suddenly
felt
herself
steadied
as
though
a
friend
had
put
an
arm
around
her
before
she
had
felt
this
light
i
am
shabby
now
she
felt
i
am
with
friendly
people
she
was
surprised
at
the
way
that
she
was
suddenly
at
her
ease
mark
was
not
beautiful
but
she
had
soft
liquid
eyes
and
her
hand
that
held
maggie
was
firm
and
warm
and
strong
let
me
introduce
you
said
mark
that
is
miss
trenchard
and
that
trenchard
this
is
my
husband
philip
this
is
miss
cardinal
miss
trenchard
must
be
forty
maggie
thought
she
was
plump
and
with
a
warm
smile
then
trenchard
was
a
clergyman
he
would
be
stout
were
he
not
so
broad
his
face
was
red
his
hair
snowy
white
but
he
did
not
look
old
he
smiled
at
maggie
as
though
he
had
known
her
all
his
life
then
there
was
mark
who
was
stocky
and
thick
and
reminded
maggie
of
martin
although
his
face
was
quite
different
he
looked
much
cleverer
and
not
such
a
boy
he
was
not
in
fact
a
boy
at
all
i
sure
he
thinks
too
hard
decided
maggie
who
had
habits
of
making
up
her
mind
at
once
about
people
well
there
no
one
to
be
frightened
about
here
she
decided
and
indeed
there
was
not
it
was
as
though
they
had
all
some
especial
reason
for
being
nice
to
her
perhaps
they
saw
that
she
was
not
in
her
own
world
here
and
yet
they
did
not
make
her
feel
that
she
drank
in
the
differences
with
great
gulps
of
appreciation
but
it
was
not
they
who
insisted
here
were
light
and
colour
and
space
above
all
rest
nothing
was
about
to
happen
no
threat
over
their
heads
that
the
roof
would
fall
beneath
one
feet
that
the
floor
would
sink
no
sudden
catching
of
the
breath
at
the
opening
of
a
door
no
hesitation
about
climbing
the
stairs
no
surveillance
by
the
watching
thomas
no
distant
clanging
of
the
chapel
bell
how
strange
they
all
seemed
looking
back
from
this
safe
harbour
the
aunts
the
warlocks
thurston
crashaw
caroline
all
of
them
there
the
imagination
set
fire
to
every
twig
here
the
imagination
was
not
needed
because
everything
occurred
before
your
eyes
she
did
not
figure
it
all
out
in
so
many
words
at
once
but
the
contrast
of
the
two
worlds
was
there
nevertheless
why
had
she
been
so
anxious
so
nervous
so
distressed
there
was
no
need
had
she
not
known
that
this
other
world
existed
perhaps
she
had
not
she
must
never
again
forget
it
katherine
mark
was
so
kind
and
friendly
her
voice
so
soft
and
her
interest
so
eager
that
maggie
felt
that
she
could
tell
her
anything
but
their
talk
was
not
to
come
just
yet
first
there
must
be
general
conversation
the
clergyman
with
the
white
hair
and
the
rosy
face
laughed
a
great
deal
in
a
schoolboy
kind
of
way
and
every
time
that
he
laughed
his
sister
who
was
like
a
pippin
apple
with
her
sunburnt
cheeks
looked
at
him
with
protecting
eyes
she
looks
after
him
in
everything
said
maggie
to
herself
he
was
called
paul
by
them
all
he
my
cousin
you
know
miss
cardinal
said
mark
and
yet
i
scarcely
ever
see
him
is
it
a
shame
grace
makes
everything
so
comfortable
for
him
grace
smiled
well
pleased
it
paul
devotion
to
his
parish
she
said
in
calm
happy
voice
as
though
she
never
had
a
surprise
in
her
life
i
sure
it
is
either
of
those
things
thought
maggie
to
herself
he
lazy
lazy
but
nice
she
had
never
seen
a
clergyman
so
healthy
so
happy
so
clean
and
so
kind
she
smiled
across
the
table
at
him
do
you
know
skeaton
he
asked
her
skeaton
where
had
she
heard
of
the
place
why
of
course
it
was
caroline
only
yesterday
i
heard
of
it
for
the
first
time
she
said
a
friend
of
mine
knows
some
one
there
beastly
place
said
mark
sand
always
blowing
into
your
eyes
and
trenchard
got
up
to
go
he
stood
a
moment
holding
maggie
hand
if
ever
you
come
to
skeaton
miss
cardinal
he
said
we
shall
be
delighted
his
eyes
she
noticed
were
light
blue
like
a
baby
she
felt
that
he
liked
her
and
would
not
forget
her
come
paul
said
miss
trenchard
rather
sharply
maggie
fancied
soon
afterwards
philip
departed
must
finish
that
beastly
thing
he
assured
his
wife
it
an
article
katherine
mark
explained
he
always
writing
about
politics
i
hate
them
so
he
pretends
to
hate
them
too
but
he
really
he
loves
them
i
know
nothing
about
politics
said
maggie
with
profound
truth
your
husband
must
be
very
clever
he
better
than
that
said
katherine
with
pride
i
hate
perfect
people
do
you
oh
indeed
i
do
said
maggie
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
they
then
came
to
her
particular
business
i
would
like
to
get
some
work
to
do
said
maggie
that
would
make
me
independent
i
have
three
hundred
pounds
of
my
own
what
can
you
do
asked
katherine
i
do
know
said
maggie
can
you
shorthand
and
type
no
i
ca
said
maggie
but
i
learn
must
you
be
independent
soon
asked
katherine
are
you
unhappy
where
you
are
maggie
paused
do
tell
me
anything
you
ought
to
said
katherine
no
answered
maggie
it
is
that
exactly
i
not
happy
at
home
but
i
think
that
my
fault
my
aunts
are
very
good
but
i
want
to
be
free
it
is
all
very
religious
where
i
am
and
they
want
me
to
believe
in
their
religion
i
afraid
i
not
religious
at
all
then
i
want
to
be
dependent
on
people
i
very
ignorant
i
know
nothing
about
anything
and
so
long
as
i
am
kept
with
my
aunts
i
shall
never
learn
she
stopped
abruptly
she
had
thought
suddenly
of
martin
his
coming
had
altered
everything
how
could
she
say
what
she
wanted
her
life
to
be
until
her
relation
to
him
were
settled
everything
depended
on
that
this
sense
of
martin
presence
silenced
her
if
i
can
feel
she
said
at
last
that
i
can
ask
your
advice
i
have
nobody
we
all
seem
oh
how
can
i
make
you
understand
properly
you
never
will
have
seen
anything
like
our
house
it
is
all
so
queer
so
away
from
everything
i
like
a
prisoner
and
that
is
perhaps
what
she
was
like
to
mark
sitting
there
in
her
funny
clothes
her
anxious
face
as
of
a
child
aged
long
before
her
time
katherine
mark
who
had
had
in
her
life
her
own
perplexities
and
sorrows
felt
her
heart
warm
to
this
strange
isolated
girl
she
had
needed
in
her
own
life
at
one
time
all
her
courage
and
she
had
used
it
she
had
never
regretted
the
step
that
she
had
then
taken
she
believed
therefore
in
courage
courage
was
eloquent
in
every
movement
of
maggie
square
reliant
body
she
could
be
braver
than
i
have
ever
been
she
thought
miss
cardinal
she
said
i
want
you
to
come
here
whenever
you
can
you
have
seen
our
boy
tim
yet
one
and
a
half
and
there
are
so
many
things
i
want
to
show
you
will
you
count
yourself
a
friend
of
the
house
maggie
blushed
and
twisted
her
hands
together
you
very
good
she
said
but
i
do
know
perhaps
you
wo
like
me
or
what
i
do
i
do
like
you
said
katherine
and
if
i
like
any
one
i
do
care
what
they
do
all
the
same
said
maggie
i
do
belong
to
your
world
your
life
i
should
shock
you
i
know
you
might
be
sorry
afterwards
that
you
knew
me
supposing
i
broke
away
but
i
broke
away
myself
said
katherine
it
is
sometimes
the
only
thing
to
do
i
made
my
mother
who
had
been
goodness
itself
to
me
desperately
unhappy
why
did
you
do
that
asked
maggie
because
i
wanted
to
marry
my
husband
well
i
love
a
man
too
said
maggie
oh
i
do
hope
you
be
happy
said
katherine
as
happy
as
i
am
no
said
maggie
shaking
her
head
i
do
expect
to
be
happy
she
seemed
to
herself
as
she
said
that
to
be
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
katherine
mark
and
her
easy
life
the
purple
curtains
and
her
amber
light
not
happy
but
satisfied
she
said
she
saw
that
it
was
five
minutes
past
six
i
must
go
she
said
when
they
said
katherine
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
if
ever
in
your
life
i
can
help
in
any
way
at
all
she
said
come
to
me
i
do
that
promised
maggie
she
coloured
and
then
herself
bent
forward
and
kissed
katherine
i
shall
like
to
think
of
you
and
all
this
she
said
and
went
she
was
let
out
into
the
outer
world
by
the
smiling
bryanston
square
was
dark
with
purple
colour
as
though
the
purple
curtains
inside
the
house
had
been
snipped
off
from
a
general
curtained
world
there
was
a
star
or
two
and
some
gaunt
trees
with
black
pointing
fingers
and
here
a
lighted
window
and
there
a
shining
doorway
behind
it
all
the
rumble
of
a
world
that
disregarded
love
and
death
and
all
the
higher
catechism
maggie
confronted
a
policeman
please
can
you
tell
me
where
the
marble
arch
is
she
asked
straight
ahead
miss
he
answered
pointing
down
the
street
you
ca
miss
it
and
she
could
not
it
soon
gleamed
white
ahead
of
her
against
the
thick
folds
of
the
sky
when
she
saw
it
her
heart
raced
in
front
of
her
like
a
pony
suddenly
released
kicking
its
heels
and
her
thoughts
were
so
strangely
wild
the
lovely
night
yes
purple
like
mark
curtains
and
scented
oranges
chrysanthemums
and
candied
oh
yes
how
kind
they
had
been
nice
clergyman
fat
a
little
but
young
in
spite
of
his
white
hair
and
aunt
anne
in
bed
under
the
crucifix
struggling
and
crashaw
smiling
lustfully
at
caroline
the
long
black
streets
strips
of
silk
and
the
lamps
like
fat
buttons
on
a
coat
there
was
a
cat
hist
hist
a
streak
of
black
against
black
and
the
chapel
bell
ringing
and
thomas
fiery
eyes
behind
all
this
confusion
there
was
martin
martin
martin
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
as
though
he
were
just
behind
her
or
was
it
that
she
was
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
she
did
not
know
but
her
heart
now
was
beating
so
thickly
that
it
was
as
though
giants
were
wrapping
cloth
after
cloth
round
it
hot
cloths
but
their
hands
were
icy
cold
no
she
was
simply
excited
desperately
madly
excited
she
had
never
been
excited
before
and
now
with
the
excitement
there
was
mingled
the
strangest
hot
pain
and
cold
pity
she
noticed
that
now
her
knees
were
trembling
and
that
if
they
trembled
much
more
she
would
not
be
able
to
walk
at
all
now
maggie
steady
your
knees
she
said
to
herself
but
look
the
houses
now
were
trembling
a
little
too
ridiculous
those
smart
houses
with
their
fine
doors
and
white
steps
to
tremble
no
it
was
her
heart
not
the
houses
do
i
look
queer
she
thought
will
people
be
looking
at
me
ideas
raced
through
her
head
now
like
horses
in
the
derby
woof
poof
off
we
go
dreot
that
square
piece
of
grass
on
the
lawn
with
the
light
on
it
her
clothes
the
socks
that
must
be
mended
caroline
silk
and
the
rustle
it
made
shops
houses
rivers
seas
death
yes
aunt
anne
cancer
and
then
with
a
great
upward
surge
like
rising
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
after
a
dive
martin
martin
martin
for
a
moment
then
she
had
to
pause
she
had
been
walking
too
fast
her
heart
jumped
then
ran
a
step
or
two
then
fell
into
a
dead
pause
she
went
on
seeing
now
nothing
but
two
lamps
that
watched
her
like
the
eyes
of
a
giant
she
was
there
this
was
a
marble
arch
all
by
itself
in
the
middle
of
the
road
she
crossed
to
it
first
went
under
it
then
thought
that
he
would
not
see
her
there
so
came
out
and
stood
nervously
rubbing
her
gloved
hands
against
one
another
and
turning
her
head
like
a
bird
swiftly
from
side
to
side
she
did
like
standing
there
it
seemed
to
make
her
so
prominent
men
stared
at
her
he
should
have
been
there
first
he
might
have
known
but
perhaps
caroline
never
gave
him
the
letter
at
that
thought
her
heart
really
did
stop
she
was
terrified
at
once
as
though
some
one
had
told
her
disastrous
news
she
would
not
wait
very
long
then
she
would
go
home
she
saw
him
he
stood
only
a
little
away
from
her
staring
about
him
looking
for
her
she
felt
that
she
had
not
seen
him
for
years
she
drank
in
his
sturdiness
his
boyish
face
his
air
of
caring
nothing
for
authority
she
had
not
seen
his
dark
blue
overcoat
before
he
stood
directly
under
a
lamp
swaying
ever
so
little
on
his
heels
his
favourite
most
characteristic
movement
he
stood
there
as
though
he
were
purposely
giving
her
a
portrait
that
she
might
remember
for
the
rest
of
her
days
she
was
too
nervous
to
move
and
then
she
wanted
that
wonderful
moment
to
last
that
moment
when
she
had
realised
that
he
had
come
to
meet
her
that
he
was
there
amongst
all
those
crowds
simply
for
her
that
he
was
looking
for
her
and
wanting
her
that
he
would
be
bitterly
disappointed
did
she
not
come
she
saw
him
give
a
little
impatient
jerk
of
the
head
the
same
movement
that
she
had
seen
him
make
in
chapel
that
jerk
set
her
in
motion
again
and
she
was
suddenly
at
his
side
she
touched
his
arm
he
turned
and
his
eyes
lit
with
pleasure
they
smiled
at
one
another
and
then
without
a
word
moved
off
towards
the
park
he
took
her
arm
and
put
it
through
his
she
felt
the
warm
thick
stuff
of
the
blue
coat
and
beneath
that
the
steady
firm
beat
of
his
heart
they
walked
closely
together
his
thigh
pressed
against
hers
and
once
and
again
her
hair
brushed
his
cheek
she
was
so
shy
that
until
they
were
through
the
gates
of
the
park
she
did
not
speak
then
she
said
i
was
so
afraid
that
caroline
would
not
give
you
the
note
oh
she
gave
it
me
all
right
he
pressed
her
arm
closer
to
him
but
i
expect
that
she
read
it
first
oh
is
she
like
that
yes
she
like
that
there
was
another
pause
they
turned
down
the
path
to
the
right
towards
the
trees
that
were
black
lumps
of
velvet
against
the
purple
sky
there
were
no
stars
and
it
was
liquidly
dark
as
though
they
ploughed
through
water
maggie
felt
suffocated
with
heat
and
persecuted
by
a
strange
weariness
she
was
suddenly
so
tired
that
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
to
walk
i
tired
she
murmured
expecting
you
afraid
that
you
come
i
believe
that
i
would
have
come
he
answered
quite
fiercely
even
if
i
had
had
the
note
i
was
determined
to
see
you
some
way
but
you
know
maggie
it
had
better
be
for
the
last
time
no
she
said
whispering
it
the
first
time
let
sit
down
here
he
said
we
alone
all
right
there
was
no
seat
near
them
the
trees
made
a
cave
of
black
above
them
and
in
front
of
them
the
grass
swept
like
a
grey
beach
into
mist
there
was
no
sound
save
a
distant
whirr
like
the
hum
of
a
top
that
died
to
a
whisper
and
then
was
lashed
by
some
infuriated
god
to
activity
again
they
sat
close
together
on
the
bench
she
felt
his
arm
move
out
as
though
he
would
embrace
her
then
suddenly
he
drew
back
no
he
said
until
we
talked
this
out
we
got
to
be
like
strangers
we
ca
go
on
you
know
maggie
and
it
no
use
your
saying
we
can
she
pressed
her
hands
tightly
together
i
can
convince
him
better
she
thought
to
herself
if
i
very
quiet
and
so
speaking
very
calmly
and
not
looking
at
him
she
went
on
but
martin
you
promised
last
time
that
it
would
depend
on
me
you
said
that
if
i
did
mind
your
being
married
and
was
willing
to
take
risks
that
we
would
go
on
together
well
i
thought
all
about
it
and
i
know
that
i
rather
be
miserable
with
you
than
happy
with
any
one
else
but
then
i
should
be
miserable
you
seem
to
think
you
could
make
me
miserable
just
as
soon
as
you
like
but
that
depends
on
myself
if
i
do
want
to
be
miserable
nobody
can
make
me
be
she
paused
he
moved
a
little
closer
and
suddenly
took
her
hand
she
drew
it
away
and
went
on
do
think
i
inexperienced
about
this
martin
you
say
i
know
nothing
about
men
perhaps
i
do
but
i
know
myself
i
know
what
i
want
and
i
can
look
after
myself
however
badly
you
treated
me
it
would
be
you
that
i
was
with
all
the
time
no
no
maggie
he
answered
speaking
rapidly
and
as
though
he
were
fiercely
protesting
against
some
one
it
is
that
at
all
you
say
you
know
yourself
but
then
i
know
myself
it
is
only
that
i
a
rotten
fellow
it
is
that
i
seem
to
bring
a
curse
on
every
one
i
fond
of
i
love
my
father
and
i
come
back
and
made
him
miserable
always
like
that
and
if
i
made
you
miserable
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
i
ever
did
i
do
even
know
whether
i
love
you
if
i
do
different
from
any
love
i
ever
had
other
women
i
be
mad
about
i
go
for
them
whatever
happened
and
got
them
somehow
and
i
care
a
bit
whether
they
were
happy
or
no
but
i
feel
about
you
almost
as
though
you
were
a
man
not
sensually
at
all
but
that
safe
steady
security
that
you
feel
for
a
man
sometimes
you
so
restful
to
be
with
i
feel
now
as
though
you
were
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
could
turn
me
into
a
decent
human
being
i
feel
as
though
we
were
just
meant
to
move
along
together
but
then
some
other
woman
would
come
like
a
fire
and
off
i
go
then
i
hate
myself
worse
than
ever
and
be
really
finished
maggie
looked
at
him
you
do
love
me
then
martin
she
asked
yes
i
do
he
answered
suddenly
i
keep
telling
myself
that
i
do
but
i
know
that
i
do
only
it
different
it
as
though
i
were
loving
myself
the
better
part
of
myself
not
something
new
and
wildly
exciting
but
something
old
that
i
had
known
always
and
that
had
always
been
with
me
if
i
went
away
now
maggie
i
know
i
come
back
one
day
perhaps
years
afterwards
but
i
know
i
come
back
it
like
that
religious
part
of
me
like
my
legs
and
my
arms
oh
it
not
of
my
own
comfort
i
doubting
but
it
you
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
maggie
darling
just
as
i
hurt
every
one
i
loved
i
come
with
you
martin
said
maggie
as
long
as
you
want
me
and
if
you
do
want
me
later
you
will
again
and
i
be
waiting
for
you
he
put
his
arm
round
her
she
crept
up
close
to
him
nestled
into
his
coat
and
put
her
hand
up
to
his
cheek
he
bent
down
his
head
and
they
kissed
after
that
there
could
be
no
more
argument
what
had
he
not
intended
to
press
upon
her
with
what
force
arid
power
had
he
not
planned
to
persuade
her
how
he
would
tell
her
that
he
did
not
love
her
that
he
would
not
be
faithful
to
her
that
he
would
treat
her
cruelly
now
it
was
all
gone
with
a
gesture
of
almost
ironic
abandonment
he
flung
away
his
scruples
it
was
always
so
life
was
stronger
than
he
he
had
tried
in
this
at
least
to
behave
like
a
decent
man
but
life
did
not
want
him
to
be
decent
and
how
he
needed
that
rest
that
she
gave
him
as
he
felt
her
close
up
against
him
folded
into
him
with
that
utterly
naif
and
childish
trust
that
had
allured
and
charmed
him
on
the
very
first
occasion
he
felt
nothing
but
a
sweet
and
blessed
rest
he
would
not
think
of
the
future
he
would
not
he
would
not
and
perhaps
all
would
be
well
as
he
pressed
her
closer
to
him
as
he
felt
her
lips
suddenly
strike
through
the
dark
find
his
check
and
then
his
mouth
as
he
felt
her
soft
confident
hand
find
his
and
then
close
and
fold
inside
it
like
a
flower
he
wondered
whether
this
once
he
might
not
force
things
to
be
right
it
was
time
he
took
things
in
hand
he
could
he
must
he
began
to
whisper
to
her
maggie
darling
it
may
be
bad
i
find
out
where
this
other
woman
is
and
she
shall
divorce
me
i
arrange
it
all
and
we
go
away
somewhere
where
i
can
work
and
we
wo
allow
anybody
to
interfere
after
all
i
older
now
the
mess
i
been
in
before
is
because
i
always
make
wrong
shots
his
words
ceased
their
hearts
were
beating
too
tumultuously
together
for
words
to
be
possible
maggie
did
not
wish
to
speak
she
could
not
she
was
mingled
with
him
her
heart
his
her
lips
his
her
check
his
she
did
not
believe
that
words
would
come
even
though
she
wished
for
them
she
was
utterly
happy
so
utterly
that
she
was
as
it
were
numb
with
happiness
they
murmured
one
another
names
martin
maggie
at
last
dreaming
scarcely
knowing
what
they
did
like
two
children
in
a
dark
wood
they
wandered
towards
home
chapter
viii
paradise
maggie
had
never
really
been
happy
before
she
had
of
course
not
known
this
her
adventures
in
introspection
had
been
very
few
besides
she
had
not
known
what
happiness
looked
like
her
father
her
uncle
and
her
aunts
were
not
exactly
happy
people
now
she
flung
herself
without
thought
or
care
into
a
flood
of
happiness
and
as
sometimes
occurs
in
life
she
was
granted
by
the
gods
beneficent
or
ironic
as
you
please
a
period
of
security
when
everything
menacing
or
dangerous
withdrew
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
world
were
in
a
conspiracy
to
cheat
her
into
confidence
she
was
confident
because
she
did
not
think
she
simply
did
not
think
at
all
she
loved
martin
and
martin
loved
her
cased
in
that
golden
armour
she
confronted
her
aunts
and
the
house
and
the
world
behind
the
house
with
a
sublime
and
happy
confidence
she
loved
her
aunts
now
she
loved
martha
and
the
parrot
and
the
cat
and
she
could
not
believe
that
they
did
not
all
love
her
because
martin
loved
her
the
rest
of
the
world
must
also
do
so
and
if
they
did
not
she
would
compel
them
for
three
whole
weeks
the
spell
lasted
for
three
marvellous
golden
weeks
when
she
looked
back
afterwards
she
wondered
that
she
had
not
seen
many
things
warnings
portents
whatever
you
please
to
call
them
but
for
three
weeks
she
saw
nothing
but
martin
and
for
three
weeks
he
saw
nothing
but
maggie
she
began
her
career
of
defiance
at
once
by
informing
aunt
anne
that
she
was
now
going
out
every
morning
to
do
her
shopping
considering
the
confinement
to
the
house
that
her
life
had
always
been
this
was
such
a
declaration
of
independence
as
those
walls
had
never
encountered
before
but
aunt
anne
never
turned
one
of
her
shining
neatly
ordered
hairs
shopping
my
dear
she
asked
yes
said
maggie
looking
her
full
in
the
face
what
sort
of
shopping
dear
oh
i
do
know
said
maggie
there
always
something
every
day
maggie
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
her
aunt
had
in
some
way
mysteriously
defeated
her
by
this
sudden
abandonment
of
all
protest
and
for
a
moment
the
mysterious
house
closed
around
her
with
its
shadows
and
dim
corners
and
the
little
tinkling
chapel
hell
in
the
heart
of
it
but
the
thought
of
martin
dissolved
the
shadows
and
off
she
went
they
agreed
to
meet
every
morning
at
eleven
outside
hatchards
the
bookseller
in
piccadilly
they
chose
that
place
because
you
could
look
into
a
bookseller
window
for
quite
a
long
time
without
seeming
odd
and
there
were
so
many
people
passing
that
no
one
noticed
you
their
habit
then
was
to
walk
to
the
corner
of
the
green
park
and
there
climb
on
to
the
top
of
a
motor
omnibus
and
go
as
far
as
they
could
within
the
allotted
time
maggie
never
in
after
life
found
those
streets
again
they
had
gone
she
supposed
to
chelsea
to
wood
to
the
heart
of
the
city
to
the
angel
islington
to
westminster
and
beyond
but
places
during
those
three
weeks
had
no
names
streets
had
no
stones
houses
no
walls
and
human
figures
no
substantiality
they
tried
on
one
or
two
occasions
to
go
by
tube
but
they
missed
the
swing
of
the
open
air
the
rush
of
the
wind
and
their
independence
of
men
and
women
often
he
tried
to
persuade
her
to
stay
with
him
for
luncheon
and
the
afternoon
but
she
was
wiser
than
he
no
she
said
everything
depends
on
keeping
them
quiet
a
little
later
on
it
will
be
lovely
you
must
leave
that
part
of
it
to
me
she
promised
him
definitely
that
soon
they
should
go
to
a
matinee
together
but
she
would
not
give
her
word
about
a
whole
evening
in
some
strange
way
she
was
frightened
of
the
evening
although
she
had
already
pledged
her
word
to
him
on
something
much
more
final
no
she
thought
to
herself
when
the
moment
comes
for
me
to
leave
everything
i
will
go
but
he
shall
know
that
i
am
not
doing
it
cheaply
simply
for
an
evening
fun
he
felt
something
of
that
too
and
did
not
try
to
persuade
her
he
hugged
his
unselfishness
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
wanted
to
follow
somebody
else
will
with
the
other
women
it
had
been
so
different
if
they
had
not
wanted
to
obey
him
he
had
left
them
but
indeed
all
through
these
three
weeks
they
were
discovering
themselves
and
one
another
and
as
though
it
were
part
of
the
general
conspiracy
only
the
best
part
of
themselves
on
the
top
of
the
as
they
sat
close
together
their
hands
locked
under
his
overcoat
the
world
bumping
and
jolting
and
jogging
about
their
feet
as
though
indeed
public
houses
and
and
cinemas
and
town
halls
and
were
always
jumping
up
tiptoe
to
see
whether
they
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lovers
martin
and
maggie
felt
that
they
were
really
divine
creatures
quite
modestly
divine
but
nevertheless
safe
from
all
human
ravages
and
earthly
failings
wicked
and
cowardly
thoughts
and
ambitions
and
desires
indeed
during
those
three
weeks
maggie
saw
nothing
of
weaknesses
his
suspicions
and
dreads
his
temper
and
the
nobility
that
martin
had
in
him
was
true
nobility
his
very
weaknesses
came
from
his
sharp
consciousness
of
what
purity
and
and
asceticism
really
were
and
that
they
were
indeed
the
only
things
for
man
to
live
by
during
those
weeks
he
saw
so
truly
the
sweetness
and
fidelity
and
simplicity
of
maggie
that
his
conscience
was
killed
his
scruples
were
numbed
he
did
not
want
during
those
weeks
any
sensual
excitement
any
depravity
any
license
a
quiet
and
noble
asceticism
seemed
to
him
perfectly
possible
he
burst
out
once
to
maggie
with
i
ca
conceive
maggie
why
i
ever
thought
life
complicated
you
straightened
everything
out
for
me
made
all
the
troubles
at
home
seem
nothing
shown
me
what
nonsense
it
was
wanting
the
rotten
things
i
was
always
after
but
maggie
had
no
eloquence
in
reply
she
could
not
make
up
fine
sentences
it
embarrassed
her
dreadfully
to
tell
him
even
that
she
loved
him
and
when
he
was
sentimental
it
was
her
habit
to
turn
it
off
with
a
joke
if
she
could
she
wanted
terribly
to
ask
him
sometimes
what
he
had
meant
when
he
said
that
he
did
love
her
as
he
had
loved
other
women
she
had
never
the
courage
to
ask
him
this
she
wondered
sometimes
why
it
had
hurt
her
when
he
had
said
he
loved
her
as
though
she
were
a
man
friend
without
any
question
of
sex
surely
enough
for
me
she
would
ask
herself
it
means
that
it
much
more
lasting
and
safe
and
yet
it
was
not
enough
nevertheless
during
these
weeks
she
found
his
brotherly
care
of
her
adorable
he
found
her
shyness
divine
every
other
woman
i
have
ever
been
in
love
with
he
told
her
once
i
have
always
kept
asking
them
would
they
ever
change
and
would
they
love
me
always
and
all
that
kind
of
nonsense
a
man
always
begins
like
that
and
then
the
time
comes
when
he
wishes
to
god
they
would
change
and
they
wo
but
you
not
like
that
maggie
i
know
you
never
change
and
i
know
that
i
shall
never
want
you
to
no
i
shall
never
change
said
maggie
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
three
weeks
a
little
incident
occurred
that
was
trivial
enough
at
the
time
but
appeared
afterwards
as
something
significant
and
full
of
meaning
this
incident
was
a
little
talk
with
poor
magnus
maggie
always
thought
of
him
as
poor
mr
magnus
he
seemed
so
feckless
and
unsettled
and
then
he
wrote
novels
that
nobody
wanted
to
buy
he
always
talked
like
a
book
and
that
was
perhaps
one
reason
why
maggie
had
avoided
him
during
these
last
months
another
reason
had
been
that
she
really
could
not
be
sure
how
far
he
was
in
the
general
conspiracy
to
drive
her
into
the
chapel
he
would
not
do
that
of
his
own
will
she
was
sure
but
being
in
love
with
aunt
anne
he
might
think
it
his
sacred
duty
and
maggie
was
terrified
of
sacred
duties
therefore
when
three
days
after
that
great
evening
in
the
park
he
caught
her
alone
in
the
her
first
impulse
was
to
run
away
then
she
looked
at
him
and
found
that
her
love
for
the
world
in
general
embraced
him
too
if
only
he
wo
talk
like
a
book
she
thought
to
herself
he
looked
more
wandering
than
ever
with
his
high
white
collar
his
large
spectacles
and
his
thin
dusty
hair
the
fire
of
some
hidden
vital
spirit
burnt
beneath
those
glasses
and
his
face
was
so
kindly
that
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
for
having
avoided
him
so
often
both
the
aunts
are
at
miss
avies
she
said
oh
he
said
looking
at
her
rather
blankly
perhaps
i
come
another
time
and
he
turned
towards
the
door
no
she
cried
you
wo
i
have
seen
you
for
months
that
not
my
fault
he
answered
i
thought
we
were
to
have
been
friends
and
you
run
away
every
time
you
saw
the
corner
of
my
dusty
coat
poking
round
the
door
yes
she
said
i
have
i
been
frightened
of
every
one
lately
and
you
not
now
he
asked
looking
at
her
with
that
sudden
bright
sharpness
that
was
so
peculiarly
his
no
i
not
she
answered
i
frightened
of
nobody
he
said
nothing
to
that
but
stared
fixedly
in
front
of
him
i
in
a
bad
mood
he
said
i
been
trying
for
weeks
to
get
on
with
a
novel
just
a
fortnight
ago
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
took
shelter
from
the
rain
in
the
doorway
of
a
deserted
house
they
still
there
now
and
they
have
said
a
word
to
one
another
all
that
time
why
not
asked
maggie
they
simply
wo
speak
he
answered
her
well
then
i
should
start
another
story
said
maggie
brightly
ah
he
said
shaking
his
head
what
the
use
of
starting
one
if
you
know
you
never
going
to
finish
it
what
the
use
of
finishing
it
if
you
know
no
one
is
ever
going
to
read
it
maggie
shook
her
head
you
changed
when
i
saw
you
last
you
told
me
that
you
did
mind
whether
any
one
ever
read
them
or
not
and
that
you
just
wrote
them
because
you
loved
doing
them
every
author
said
magnus
gloomily
says
that
to
himself
when
he
ca
sell
his
books
but
it
all
vainglory
i
afraid
i
ca
help
being
glad
maggie
answered
there
are
such
interesting
things
you
might
do
i
ca
imagine
why
any
one
writes
books
now
when
there
are
so
many
already
in
existence
that
nobody
read
he
was
listening
to
her
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
said
quite
wildly
it
terrible
all
this
that
going
on
you
know
about
it
of
course
warlock
visions
i
mean
and
the
trouble
it
making
outside
it
and
you
outside
it
but
we
being
brought
into
it
all
the
same
how
can
we
help
it
when
we
love
the
people
who
are
in
it
it
so
easy
to
say
that
it
nonsense
that
people
ought
to
be
wiser
nowadays
that
it
hysteria
even
insanity
i
know
all
that
and
of
course
i
do
believe
for
a
moment
that
god
coming
in
a
chariot
of
fire
on
new
year
eve
especially
for
the
benefit
of
thurston
miss
avies
and
the
rest
but
that
does
end
it
it
ought
to
end
it
but
it
does
there
more
in
some
people
madness
than
in
other
sanity
and
anyway
even
if
it
all
nonsense
it
means
life
or
death
to
your
aunt
and
some
of
the
others
and
it
means
a
certain
breaking
up
of
all
this
place
and
it
probably
means
the
triumph
of
a
charlatan
like
thurston
and
the
increase
of
humbug
in
the
world
and
the
discouragement
of
all
the
honest
adventurers
i
call
myself
an
adventurer
you
know
miss
maggie
although
i
a
poor
specimen
but
i
damned
if
it
better
to
be
a
poor
adventurer
than
to
be
a
fat
swollen
contented
who
can
see
just
as
far
as
his
nose
and
his
and
might
be
just
as
well
dead
as
alive
i
beg
your
pardon
he
added
suddenly
for
swearing
i
not
myself
i
not
really
she
could
see
indeed
that
he
was
in
great
agitation
of
mind
and
some
of
this
agitation
communicated
itself
to
her
had
she
not
been
selfish
in
forgetting
all
this
through
her
own
happiness
he
was
right
she
was
part
of
it
all
whether
she
wished
or
no
what
do
you
think
she
asked
dropping
her
voice
a
little
is
the
real
truth
about
it
the
real
truth
he
looked
at
her
suddenly
with
a
tender
most
charming
smile
that
took
away
his
ugliness
ah
that
a
tremendous
question
part
of
the
truth
is
that
warlock
been
praying
so
much
and
eating
so
little
that
it
would
be
odd
indeed
if
he
did
see
visions
of
some
sort
and
part
of
the
truth
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
women
in
the
world
who
believe
simply
anything
that
you
tell
them
it
part
of
the
truth
too
that
there
are
scoundrels
in
the
world
who
will
take
advantage
of
anybody
simple
trust
to
fill
their
pockets
but
not
all
he
went
on
shaking
his
head
no
that
not
all
it
part
of
the
truth
that
there
is
a
mystery
and
that
human
beings
will
go
on
searching
whatever
all
the
materialists
and
merchants
in
the
world
can
try
to
do
to
stop
them
i
remember
years
ago
an
old
man
a
little
off
his
dot
telling
my
father
that
he
the
old
man
was
a
treasure
hunter
he
told
my
father
that
the
world
was
divided
into
two
halves
the
treasure
hunters
and
the
town
councillors
and
that
the
two
halves
would
never
join
and
never
even
meet
my
father
who
was
a
practical
man
said
that
the
old
idiot
should
be
shut
up
in
an
asylum
and
eventually
i
believe
he
was
have
him
going
off
one
day
my
father
said
a
cargo
boat
with
a
map
in
his
pocket
looking
for
gold
pieces
but
it
was
gold
pieces
he
was
after
to
maggie
it
was
always
irritating
the
way
that
magnus
would
wander
away
from
the
subject
she
brought
him
back
now
with
a
jerk
no
but
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
happen
she
asked
him
i
do
know
he
answered
i
ca
tell
but
i
know
all
my
happiness
here
is
coming
to
an
end
and
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
if
i
were
a
strong
man
i
would
go
out
and
find
all
the
other
treasure
hunters
all
the
vicious
ones
and
the
diseased
and
the
drunkards
and
the
perverted
and
i
would
try
to
found
some
kind
of
a
society
so
that
they
should
recognise
one
another
all
the
world
over
and
should
feel
so
lonely
and
deserted
and
hopelessly
done
for
i
do
mean
a
society
for
improving
them
mind
you
or
warning
them
or
telling
them
they
go
to
prison
if
they
do
do
better
that
none
of
my
business
but
it
seems
to
be
a
solemn
fact
that
you
are
a
treasure
hunter
until
there
something
wrong
with
you
until
you
got
a
sin
stronger
than
you
are
or
until
you
done
something
disgraceful
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
not
that
i
believe
in
weakness
or
in
giving
way
to
things
no
one
admires
the
strong
and
the
brave
more
than
i
do
i
think
a
man
a
fool
if
he
does
fight
as
hard
as
he
can
but
there
a
brotherhood
of
the
dissatisfied
and
the
uneasy
and
the
and
i
believe
it
they
who
will
discover
the
grail
in
the
end
if
it
ever
going
to
be
discovered
at
all
he
broke
off
then
said
restlessly
i
think
things
out
you
know
and
at
last
i
come
to
a
conclusion
and
it
ends
by
being
a
platitude
that
all
the
goody
goody
books
have
said
times
without
number
but
all
the
same
that
does
prevent
it
from
being
my
discovery
it
nothing
to
do
with
goodness
and
nothing
to
do
with
evil
it
nothing
to
do
with
strength
and
nothing
to
do
with
weakness
it
simply
is
that
there
are
some
people
who
want
what
they
can
see
and
no
more
and
there
are
others
the
baffled
fighting
and
disordered
others
for
whom
nothing
that
they
can
see
with
their
mortal
eyes
is
enough
and
who
be
restless
all
their
days
with
their
queer
little
maps
and
their
mysterious
thumbed
directions
to
some
island
or
other
that
never
reach
and
never
even
get
a
ship
for
he
stopped
and
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
maggie
was
silent
because
she
never
knew
what
to
say
when
he
burst
into
parables
and
divided
mankind
under
strange
names
into
different
camps
and
yet
this
time
she
did
know
a
little
what
he
was
after
there
was
that
house
of
katharine
mark
the
other
day
with
its
comfort
and
quiet
and
kind
smiling
clergyman
and
there
was
this
strange
place
with
all
of
them
in
an
odd
quiver
of
excitement
waiting
for
something
to
happen
but
she
could
speak
to
him
about
that
she
could
say
anything
to
him
at
all
he
cleared
his
throat
as
though
he
were
embarrassed
and
were
conscious
that
he
had
been
making
a
fool
of
himself
maggie
felt
that
he
was
disappointed
in
her
she
was
sorry
for
that
but
she
was
as
she
was
well
i
glad
you
happy
he
said
looking
at
her
wistfully
he
got
up
and
stood
awkwardly
looking
at
her
i
want
you
to
promise
me
something
he
said
that
really
what
i
came
for
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
wo
in
any
case
leave
your
aunts
before
the
new
year
she
got
up
looked
at
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
yes
she
said
i
promise
that
the
year
had
only
a
week
or
two
more
to
run
and
she
was
not
afraid
of
that
little
space
of
time
he
seemed
to
want
to
say
something
more
but
after
hesitating
he
suddenly
made
a
bolt
for
the
door
and
she
could
hear
him
stumbling
downstairs
she
forgot
him
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
house
but
his
words
nevertheless
brought
her
to
consider
her
aunts
next
morning
at
breakfast
time
she
had
a
further
reason
to
consider
them
aunt
elizabeth
met
her
when
she
came
downstairs
with
a
very
grave
face
your
aunt
had
a
terrible
night
she
said
she
insisted
on
coming
downstairs
i
told
her
not
she
never
listens
to
anything
i
say
maggie
could
see
that
something
more
than
ordinary
had
occurred
aunt
elizabeth
was
on
the
edge
of
tears
and
in
so
confused
a
state
of
mind
that
she
put
sugar
into
her
egg
and
then
ate
it
with
a
puzzled
air
as
though
she
could
not
be
sure
why
it
tasted
so
strange
when
aunt
anne
came
in
it
was
plain
enough
that
she
had
wrestled
with
demons
during
the
night
maggie
had
often
seen
her
before
battling
with
pain
and
refusing
to
be
defeated
now
she
looked
as
though
she
had
but
risen
from
the
dead
it
was
a
ghost
in
very
truth
that
stood
there
a
ghost
in
black
silk
dress
with
white
wristbands
and
a
stiff
white
collar
black
hair
so
tightly
drawn
back
and
ordered
that
it
was
like
a
shining
her
face
was
white
with
the
effect
of
a
chalk
drawing
into
which
live
black
burning
eyes
had
been
stuck
but
it
was
none
of
these
things
that
frightened
maggie
it
was
the
expression
somewhere
in
the
mouth
in
the
eyes
in
the
pale
bony
hands
that
spoke
of
some
meeting
with
a
torturer
whose
powers
were
almost
omniscient
almost
but
not
quite
pain
sheer
physical
brutal
pain
came
into
the
room
hulking
steering
behind
aunt
anne
shoulder
it
grinned
at
maggie
and
said
you
have
begun
to
feel
what
i
can
do
yet
but
every
one
has
his
turn
you
need
flatter
yourself
that
you
going
to
escape
when
aunt
anne
moved
now
it
was
with
infinite
caution
as
though
she
were
stalking
her
enemy
and
was
afraid
lest
any
incautious
gesture
should
betray
her
into
his
ambush
no
less
marked
than
her
torture
was
her
courage
and
the
expectation
that
sustained
that
courage
she
had
her
eyes
set
upon
something
very
sure
and
very
certain
maggie
was
afraid
to
think
what
that
expectation
might
be
but
maggie
had
grown
during
these
last
weeks
she
did
not
now
kiss
her
aunt
and
try
to
show
an
affection
which
was
not
so
genuine
as
she
would
have
liked
it
to
be
by
nervous
little
demonstrations
she
said
gravely
i
am
so
sorry
aunt
anne
that
you
have
had
so
bad
a
night
shall
i
stay
this
morning
and
read
to
you
even
as
she
spoke
she
realised
with
sharp
pain
what
giving
up
her
meeting
with
martin
meant
what
were
you
going
to
do
dear
asked
aunt
anne
her
eyes
seeing
as
ever
far
beyond
maggie
and
the
room
and
the
house
as
she
spoke
thomas
the
cat
came
forward
and
began
rubbing
himself
very
gently
as
though
he
were
whispering
something
to
his
mistress
against
her
dress
maggie
had
an
impulse
so
strong
that
it
almost
defeated
her
to
burst
out
with
the
whole
truth
she
almost
said
i
going
out
to
meet
martin
warlock
whom
i
love
and
with
whom
i
going
to
live
she
hated
deceit
she
hated
lies
but
this
was
some
one
else
secret
as
well
as
her
own
and
telling
the
truth
now
would
only
lead
to
much
pain
and
distress
and
then
more
lies
and
more
deceit
so
she
said
i
going
to
piccadilly
to
get
some
things
for
aunt
elizabeth
yes
said
aunt
elizabeth
she
saves
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
she
a
good
girl
i
know
she
a
good
girl
said
aunt
anne
softly
it
was
strange
to
remember
the
time
not
so
long
ago
when
to
run
out
of
the
house
and
post
a
letter
had
seemed
a
bold
defiant
thing
to
do
threatened
with
grave
penalties
the
aunts
had
changed
their
plans
about
her
and
had
given
her
no
reasons
for
doing
so
no
reasons
were
ever
given
in
that
house
for
anything
that
was
done
the
more
maggie
went
out
the
more
she
was
drawn
in
on
her
way
to
martin
that
morning
the
figure
of
aunt
anne
haunted
her
she
felt
for
a
brief
moment
that
she
would
do
anything
yes
even
surrender
martin
to
ease
her
aunt
pain
and
then
she
knew
that
she
would
not
and
she
called
herself
cruel
and
selfish
and
felt
for
an
instant
a
dark
shadow
threatening
her
because
she
was
so
but
when
she
saw
martin
outside
hatchard
she
forgot
it
all
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
during
those
weeks
they
neither
of
them
asked
any
questions
about
their
home
affairs
it
was
as
though
they
both
inwardly
realised
that
there
was
trouble
for
them
of
every
kind
waiting
outside
and
that
they
could
only
definitely
realise
their
happiness
by
building
a
wall
around
themselves
they
knew
perhaps
in
their
secret
hearts
or
at
any
rate
martin
knew
that
they
could
not
hold
their
castle
for
long
but
is
not
the
gift
of
three
perfect
weeks
a
great
thing
for
any
human
being
to
be
given
and
who
has
the
temerity
the
challenging
audacity
to
ask
with
confidence
for
even
so
much
on
this
particular
morning
martin
said
to
her
before
we
get
into
the
maggie
you
got
to
come
into
a
shop
with
me
he
was
especially
boyish
and
happy
and
natural
that
morning
it
was
strange
how
his
face
altered
when
he
was
happy
his
brow
was
clear
his
eyes
were
bright
and
he
had
a
kind
of
crooked
confident
smile
that
must
have
won
anybody
heart
his
whole
carriage
was
that
of
a
boy
who
was
entering
life
for
the
first
time
with
undaunted
expectation
that
it
could
give
him
nothing
but
the
best
and
jolliest
things
maggie
as
she
looked
at
him
this
morning
caught
her
breath
with
the
astonishing
force
of
her
love
for
him
oh
how
i
look
after
him
was
her
thought
he
shall
never
be
unhappy
again
they
crossed
the
street
together
and
stood
for
a
moment
close
together
on
the
kerb
in
the
middle
way
as
though
they
were
quite
alone
in
the
world
she
caught
his
arm
and
they
ran
before
a
charging
laughing
people
turned
back
and
looked
at
them
so
happy
they
seemed
they
walked
up
bond
street
and
martin
drew
her
into
a
jeweller
she
had
never
possessed
any
ornament
except
her
coral
necklace
in
all
her
life
and
she
knew
now
for
the
first
time
how
terribly
she
liked
beautiful
things
it
was
useless
of
her
to
pretend
that
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
going
to
give
her
something
she
did
not
pretend
a
very
thin
old
man
who
looked
like
one
of
the
prophets
drawn
out
of
the
wilderness
and
clothed
by
the
most
fashionable
of
london
tailors
looking
over
their
shoulders
as
he
talked
to
them
because
he
saw
at
once
that
they
were
not
customers
who
were
likely
to
add
very
much
to
his
shop
exchequer
produced
a
large
tray
full
of
rings
that
glittered
and
sparkled
and
danced
as
though
they
been
told
to
show
themselves
off
to
the
best
possible
advantage
but
for
maggie
at
once
there
was
only
one
possible
ring
it
was
a
thin
hoop
of
gold
with
three
small
pearls
set
in
the
middle
of
it
nothing
very
especial
about
it
it
was
in
fact
less
striking
than
almost
any
other
ring
in
the
tray
maggie
looked
at
the
ring
and
the
ring
looked
at
maggie
it
was
as
though
the
ring
said
i
shall
belong
to
you
whether
you
take
me
or
no
now
said
martin
with
a
little
catch
in
his
throat
you
make
your
choice
maggie
he
was
not
a
millionaire
but
he
did
honestly
intend
that
whatever
ring
she
chose
she
should
have
oh
said
maggie
whispering
because
the
shop
was
so
large
and
the
prophet
so
indifferent
do
you
think
you
better
choose
at
the
same
time
she
felt
the
anxious
gaze
of
the
three
little
pearls
upon
her
no
said
martin
i
want
to
give
you
what
you
like
i
like
what
you
like
said
maggie
still
whispering
at
this
banality
the
prophet
made
a
little
impatient
movement
as
though
he
really
could
not
be
expected
to
stand
waiting
there
for
ever
also
a
magnificent
lady
in
furs
so
rich
that
you
could
see
nothing
of
her
but
her
powdered
nose
was
waving
ropes
of
pearls
about
in
a
blase
manner
very
close
to
them
and
maggie
had
a
strange
entirely
unreasonable
fear
that
this
splendour
would
suddenly
turn
round
and
snatch
the
little
pearl
ring
and
go
off
with
it
i
like
that
one
said
maggie
pointing
she
heard
the
prophet
sniff
his
contempt
but
she
did
not
care
martin
although
he
would
willingly
have
given
her
the
most
gorgeous
ring
in
the
shop
was
delighted
to
find
that
her
taste
was
so
good
and
like
herself
he
had
great
ideas
about
taste
some
of
his
secret
fears
had
been
lest
her
strange
uncouth
upbringing
should
have
caused
her
to
like
gaudy
things
he
could
have
hugged
her
before
them
all
when
she
chose
that
particular
ring
which
he
had
himself
noticed
as
the
prettiest
and
neatest
there
just
see
whether
it
fits
darling
he
said
at
the
word
darling
the
prophet
cast
another
despairing
look
about
the
shop
as
though
he
knew
well
the
length
of
time
that
lovers
could
take
over
these
things
if
they
once
put
their
hearts
into
it
maggie
was
ashamed
of
her
stubby
finger
as
she
put
her
hand
forward
but
the
ring
fitted
exactly
that
right
said
martin
now
we
have
this
put
into
a
case
how
wonderful
he
is
thought
maggie
not
as
other
women
might
have
thought
i
wonder
how
many
times
he
done
this
before
maggie
thought
then
that
it
would
be
more
proper
to
retire
a
little
so
that
she
should
not
know
the
price
and
she
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
looking
upon
the
wind
and
weather
in
bond
street
and
the
magnificent
motor
car
that
belonged
to
the
lady
with
the
pearls
and
a
magnificent
chauffeur
who
was
so
superior
that
it
was
probable
that
the
lady
with
the
pearls
belonged
to
him
and
she
saw
none
of
these
things
but
was
conscious
of
herself
and
martin
wrapt
together
in
a
mist
of
happiness
that
no
outside
force
could
penetrate
as
they
walked
away
from
the
shop
she
said
of
course
i
wo
be
able
to
wear
it
he
put
the
little
square
box
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
into
her
hand
and
answered
you
can
wear
it
on
a
ribbon
under
your
dress
oh
yes
she
whispered
pressing
his
hand
for
a
moment
they
did
not
climb
on
to
a
that
morning
but
walked
ahead
blindly
blissfully
they
did
not
know
whither
they
were
now
in
wild
days
at
the
end
of
november
and
the
weather
was
tempestuous
the
wind
blowing
with
a
screaming
fury
and
black
clouds
scudding
across
the
sky
like
portents
little
heavy
drops
of
rain
fell
with
a
sudden
urgency
as
though
they
were
emphasising
some
secret
figures
were
swept
through
the
streets
and
the
roar
of
the
wind
was
so
vehement
that
the
traffic
seemed
to
make
no
sound
and
yet
nothing
happened
no
great
storm
of
rain
no
devastating
flood
it
was
a
day
of
warning
they
noticed
nothing
of
the
weather
it
might
have
been
a
world
of
burning
sunshine
for
all
they
saw
of
it
you
know
said
martin
i
never
liked
giving
any
one
anything
so
much
as
i
liked
giving
you
that
ring
i
wish
i
could
give
you
something
too
she
said
well
you
can
he
said
some
little
thing
that
i
carry
about
with
me
always
oh
maggie
he
went
on
is
it
strange
how
easy
it
is
to
be
good
when
no
one
worries
you
these
last
ten
days
with
you
i
could
have
done
anything
wrong
if
i
tried
it
is
fair
to
say
we
can
help
ourselves
we
ca
something
just
comes
along
and
seizes
you
and
makes
you
do
wrong
oh
i
do
know
said
maggie
do
let
talk
about
those
things
it
like
magnus
who
says
we
treasure
hunters
or
pools
of
water
or
old
men
in
asylums
i
do
understand
all
that
i
just
maggie
all
the
same
i
believe
one
can
do
what
one
wants
to
i
do
believe
people
can
make
one
do
things
do
you
think
any
one
could
make
me
not
love
you
if
they
tried
i
shall
love
you
always
whatever
happens
i
know
i
shall
never
change
i
not
one
to
change
i
obstinate
father
used
to
say
as
a
pig
that
made
her
think
of
the
old
days
at
dreot
just
then
as
they
seemed
so
remote
she
began
to
tell
him
of
those
old
days
of
the
vicarage
of
the
holes
in
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
of
her
loneliness
and
the
way
the
villagers
used
to
talk
of
her
solitary
walks
and
looking
down
on
to
polchester
from
the
of
her
father
sudden
death
of
uncle
mathew
he
a
funny
old
codger
said
martin
what
does
he
do
i
do
know
said
maggie
i
really
do
know
how
he
lives
afraid
it
something
rather
bad
i
known
men
like
that
said
martin
plenty
but
it
funny
that
one
of
them
should
be
connected
with
you
it
does
seem
as
though
you
could
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
like
that
oh
but
i
like
him
said
maggie
he
been
very
kind
to
me
often
when
i
was
all
alone
after
father
died
he
was
very
good
she
stopped
abruptly
remembering
how
he
come
into
her
bedroom
drink
been
his
trouble
and
never
having
any
money
he
told
me
once
if
he
had
money
he
never
do
a
thing
he
should
yes
said
martin
that
what
they
always
say
when
they
have
any
money
and
then
when
they
have
any
it
worse
than
ever
he
was
thinking
perhaps
of
himself
at
any
rate
to
stop
remorseful
thoughts
he
began
to
tell
her
about
his
own
childhood
mine
was
very
different
from
yours
maggie
he
said
i
lonely
you
do
know
what
a
fuss
people
made
of
me
i
was
conceited
too
i
thought
i
was
chosen
by
god
out
of
all
the
world
that
i
was
different
from
every
one
else
and
better
too
when
i
was
only
about
nine
at
home
one
sunday
they
asked
me
if
i
say
a
prayer
and
i
did
before
them
all
made
it
up
and
went
on
for
quarter
of
an
hour
lord
i
must
have
been
an
awful
child
and
outside
the
religious
time
i
was
as
wicked
as
i
could
be
i
used
to
go
down
into
the
kitchen
and
steal
the
food
and
i
dress
up
as
a
ghost
to
frighten
amy
and
i
break
china
i
remember
once
after
we
had
a
service
in
the
and
two
girls
had
gone
into
hysterics
i
stole
down
into
the
kitchen
in
my
nightdress
to
get
some
jam
and
i
found
one
of
the
elders
making
love
to
the
cook
they
were
both
so
fat
and
he
had
his
coat
and
waistcoat
off
and
he
was
kissing
her
neck
my
word
they
were
frightened
when
they
saw
me
standing
there
after
that
i
could
do
what
i
liked
with
the
cook
we
used
to
have
prayer
meetings
in
the
and
sometimes
father
would
pray
so
hard
that
the
glass
chandelier
would
shake
and
rattle
till
i
used
to
think
it
would
come
down
and
the
funny
thing
was
that
one
minute
i
be
pinching
amy
who
was
kneeling
next
to
me
and
the
next
i
be
shaking
with
religion
and
seeing
god
standing
right
in
front
of
me
by
the
such
a
it
was
then
and
so
it
is
now
amy
always
hated
me
she
was
really
religious
and
she
thought
i
was
a
hypocrite
but
i
altogether
there
was
something
real
in
it
and
there
still
is
did
you
go
to
school
asked
maggie
no
that
was
the
mistake
they
never
sent
me
father
loved
me
too
much
and
he
wanted
to
keep
me
always
with
him
he
tried
to
teach
me
himself
but
i
never
learnt
anything
i
always
knew
i
could
turn
them
round
my
little
finger
i
always
knew
he
rather
do
anything
than
make
me
unhappy
sometimes
we
had
lovely
times
together
sitting
in
the
dusk
in
the
front
of
the
fire
do
you
know
maggie
i
never
changed
in
my
love
for
father
i
changed
in
everything
else
but
in
that
never
yet
i
hurt
him
over
and
over
and
over
again
i
done
things
here
he
broke
off
was
to
be
happy
they
must
build
up
their
walls
faster
faster
faster
to
keep
the
world
out
he
would
think
of
nothing
nothing
but
the
present
the
wind
blew
and
the
heavy
drops
of
rain
fell
one
and
one
and
one
slowly
between
the
gusts
ho
drew
her
close
to
him
are
you
cold
no
martin
dear
i
suppose
we
should
turn
back
yes
it
getting
late
it
will
seem
hours
until
and
to
me
too
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
green
park
there
was
no
one
there
they
kissed
and
clung
together
and
maggie
hand
was
warm
inside
his
coat
then
they
turned
back
and
entered
the
real
world
once
more
now
we
must
have
our
matinee
martin
said
maggie
could
not
refuse
and
besides
she
herself
wanted
it
so
badly
also
the
three
weeks
were
drawing
to
a
close
and
although
she
did
not
know
what
was
in
store
for
them
she
felt
in
some
mysterious
way
that
trouble
was
coming
yes
we
have
our
matinee
she
said
it
was
a
terrific
excitement
for
her
apart
altogether
from
her
love
for
martin
she
had
of
course
never
been
to
a
theatre
she
could
not
imagine
in
the
least
what
it
was
like
it
so
happened
by
a
wonderful
chance
that
a
note
came
from
katherine
mark
asking
her
to
tea
she
showed
this
to
the
aunts
and
said
that
she
would
accept
it
she
wrote
to
katherine
mark
and
refused
and
told
martin
that
for
that
wednesday
afternoon
she
was
quite
free
until
at
least
seven
she
wove
these
deceits
with
strong
disgust
she
hated
the
lies
and
there
were
many
many
times
when
she
was
on
the
edge
of
confessing
everything
to
the
aunts
but
the
thought
of
what
would
follow
that
confession
held
her
back
she
could
not
make
things
harder
for
martin
nevertheless
she
wondered
why
when
she
felt
in
herself
no
shame
al
all
at
the
things
that
she
was
doing
she
should
have
to
lie
to
cover
those
things
up
but
everything
in
connection
with
the
chapel
seemed
to
the
place
was
wrapped
in
intrigue
and
how
long
would
it
be
before
she
and
martin
were
out
of
it
all
she
was
to
meet
him
by
one
of
the
lions
in
trafalgar
square
she
bought
a
golden
chrysanthemum
which
she
stuck
into
the
belt
of
her
black
dress
and
she
wore
her
coral
necklace
she
was
tired
of
black
she
sometimes
thought
she
would
spend
all
her
three
hundred
pounds
on
clothes
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
house
and
had
turned
the
corner
into
king
william
street
she
slipped
on
her
ring
she
kissed
it
before
she
put
her
glove
on
he
was
waiting
there
looking
like
a
happy
schoolboy
that
way
that
she
loved
him
to
look
that
slow
crooked
smile
of
his
something
that
broke
up
his
whole
face
into
geniality
and
friendliness
how
she
adored
him
when
he
looked
like
that
he
was
wearing
clothes
of
some
rough
stuff
and
a
black
knitted
tie
she
was
carrying
something
a
little
parcel
in
tissue
paper
she
pressed
it
into
his
hand
when
they
met
he
opened
it
just
like
a
boy
chuckling
his
eyes
shining
his
fingers
tearing
the
paper
in
his
eagerness
her
present
was
a
round
locket
of
thin
plain
gold
and
inside
was
the
funniest
little
black
faded
photograph
of
maggie
her
head
only
a
wild
untidy
head
of
hair
a
fat
round
schoolgirl
face
a
village
snapshot
of
maggie
taken
in
dreot
when
she
was
about
fifteen
it
all
i
had
she
said
i
remembered
it
the
other
day
and
i
found
it
a
travelling
photographer
took
it
one
day
he
came
to
the
village
and
every
one
was
taken
father
and
all
it
very
bad
but
it
was
the
only
one
it
wonderful
said
martin
and
truly
it
was
wonderful
it
had
caught
by
a
marvellous
chance
in
spite
of
its
shabby
faded
darkness
the
very
soul
of
maggie
was
it
her
hair
her
untidy
hair
or
the
honesty
of
her
eyes
or
the
strength
and
trustiness
of
her
mouth
but
then
it
was
to
any
one
who
did
not
know
her
the
bad
dim
photograph
of
an
untidy
child
to
any
one
who
did
know
her
the
very
stamp
and
witness
of
maggie
and
all
that
she
was
maggie
had
spent
shillings
on
the
locket
she
had
had
three
pounds
put
away
from
her
allowance
in
her
drawer
it
was
a
very
simple
locket
thin
plain
gold
round
and
smooth
but
good
and
it
would
last
you
darling
whispered
martin
there
could
have
been
anything
more
like
you
if
you
been
taken
by
the
grandest
photographer
in
london
they
started
off
towards
shaftesbury
avenue
where
the
theatre
was
and
as
they
went
a
funny
little
incident
occurred
they
were
both
too
happy
to
talk
and
maggie
was
too
happy
even
to
think
suddenly
she
was
aware
that
some
one
was
coming
towards
her
whom
she
knew
she
looked
and
tugged
herself
from
that
world
of
martin
and
only
martin
in
which
she
was
immersed
it
was
the
large
smiling
clergyman
trenchard
yes
certainly
it
was
he
he
had
recognised
her
and
was
stopping
to
speak
to
her
martin
moved
on
a
little
and
stood
waiting
for
her
she
was
confused
and
embarrassed
but
pleased
too
because
he
seemed
glad
to
see
her
he
looked
the
very
picture
of
a
kindly
genial
friend
who
had
known
her
all
his
life
he
was
wearing
a
beautifully
shining
and
his
stiff
white
collar
gleamed
yes
he
was
glad
to
see
her
and
he
said
so
he
remembered
her
name
miss
cardinal
he
called
her
how
had
she
been
what
had
she
been
doing
had
she
seen
mark
he
was
staying
with
his
sister
at
brown
hotel
in
somewhere
she
did
catch
the
name
of
the
street
his
sister
would
be
so
glad
if
she
would
come
and
see
them
one
day
would
she
come
he
would
tie
her
down
but
she
had
only
to
write
and
say
she
was
coming
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
for
a
moment
and
looked
in
her
eyes
with
the
kindliest
friendliest
regard
he
was
glad
to
have
seen
her
he
should
tell
his
sister
he
was
gone
and
maggie
really
could
not
be
sure
what
she
had
said
something
very
silly
she
could
be
certain
stupid
the
pleasure
that
his
few
words
had
given
her
but
she
felt
once
again
as
she
had
felt
in
katherine
mark
the
contact
with
that
other
world
that
safe
happy
comfortable
assured
world
in
which
everything
was
exactly
what
it
seemed
she
was
glad
that
he
liked
her
and
that
his
sister
liked
her
then
she
could
not
be
so
wild
and
odd
and
uncivilised
as
she
often
was
afraid
that
she
was
she
rejoined
martin
with
a
little
added
glow
in
her
cheeks
who
was
that
martin
asked
her
rather
sharply
she
told
him
one
of
those
humbugging
parsons
he
said
he
stood
over
you
as
though
he
like
to
eat
you
oh
i
sure
he
not
a
humbug
she
answered
you
be
taken
in
by
anybody
he
told
her
oh
no
i
should
she
said
now
forget
him
and
they
did
by
the
time
they
had
reached
piccadilly
circus
they
were
once
more
deep
deep
in
one
another
they
were
back
in
their
dark
and
gleaming
wood
the
lyric
theatre
was
their
destination
maggie
drew
a
breath
as
they
stepped
into
the
hall
where
there
stood
two
large
stout
commissionaires
in
blue
uniforms
gold
buttons
and
white
gloves
people
pushed
past
them
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
on
either
side
as
though
a
theatre
were
a
nothing
maggie
stood
there
fingering
her
gloves
and
feeling
lonely
the
oil
painting
of
a
beautiful
lady
with
a
row
of
shining
teeth
faced
her
there
were
also
some
palms
and
a
hole
in
the
wall
with
a
man
behind
it
soon
they
too
passed
down
the
stairs
curtains
were
drawn
back
and
maggie
was
sitting
quite
suddenly
in
a
large
desert
of
gold
and
red
plush
with
emptiness
on
every
side
of
it
and
a
crowd
of
people
behind
a
wooden
partition
staring
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
felt
as
though
she
had
no
clothes
on
she
gave
a
hurried
glance
at
these
people
and
turned
round
blushing
why
do
they
sit
with
us
she
whispered
to
martin
they
the
pit
and
we
the
stalls
he
whispered
to
her
but
that
comforted
her
very
little
wo
people
come
and
sit
where
we
are
she
asked
oh
yes
we
early
he
told
her
soon
she
was
more
composed
and
happier
she
sat
very
close
to
martin
her
knee
against
his
and
his
hand
near
to
hers
just
touching
the
outside
of
her
palm
her
ring
sparkled
and
the
three
little
pearls
smiled
at
her
as
he
breathed
she
breathed
too
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
their
bodies
rose
and
fell
as
one
body
without
looking
directly
at
him
which
would
she
knew
embarrass
him
before
all
those
hungry
people
behind
her
she
could
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
see
the
ruddy
brown
of
his
cheek
and
the
hard
thick
curve
of
his
shoulder
she
was
his
she
belonged
to
no
one
else
in
the
world
she
was
his
utterly
utterly
ever
so
swiftly
and
gently
her
hand
brushed
for
an
instant
over
his
he
responded
crooking
his
little
finger
for
a
moment
inside
hers
she
smiled
she
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
people
triumphantly
she
felt
a
deep
contented
rest
in
her
heart
rich
and
full
proud
and
arrogant
the
mother
the
lover
the
sister
the
child
everything
to
him
she
was
people
came
in
the
theatre
filled
and
a
hum
of
talk
arose
then
the
orchestra
began
to
tune
and
soon
music
was
playing
and
maggie
would
have
loved
to
listen
but
the
people
must
chatter
when
suddenly
the
lights
went
down
the
only
thing
of
which
she
was
conscious
was
that
martin
hand
had
suddenly
seized
hers
roughly
sharply
and
was
crushing
it
pressing
the
ring
into
the
flesh
so
that
it
hurt
her
first
excited
wondering
thought
then
was
he
does
care
for
me
any
more
only
as
a
there
the
other
now
and
a
strange
shyness
timidity
and
triumph
overwhelmed
her
so
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
her
body
trembling
but
as
the
play
continued
she
must
listen
it
was
her
very
first
play
and
soon
it
was
thrilling
to
her
so
that
she
forgot
for
a
time
even
martin
or
rather
martin
was
mingled
with
it
absorbed
in
it
part
of
it
and
she
was
there
too
sharing
with
him
the
very
action
of
the
story
it
was
a
very
play
about
a
little
charity
girl
who
was
brought
up
by
a
kindly
gentleman
who
cared
for
nothing
but
books
he
brought
her
up
on
his
own
plan
with
a
view
to
marrying
her
afterwards
but
meanwhile
of
course
she
saw
a
handsome
young
soldier
who
was
young
like
herself
and
she
was
naturally
bored
with
the
studious
gentleman
maggie
shared
all
the
feelings
of
the
charity
girl
had
she
been
brought
up
say
by
a
man
like
trenchard
and
then
had
met
martin
why
of
course
she
could
have
gone
only
one
way
the
soldier
was
not
like
martin
being
slim
and
curled
and
beautiful
nor
was
the
studious
gentleman
like
trenchard
being
thin
and
tall
with
a
face
like
a
monk
and
a
beautiful
voice
but
the
girl
was
like
maggie
prettier
of
course
and
with
artful
ways
but
untidy
a
little
and
not
very
well
educated
at
the
first
interval
when
the
lights
were
up
and
the
band
was
playing
and
the
people
walking
martin
whispered
do
you
like
it
maggie
i
love
it
she
answered
and
then
they
just
sat
there
without
another
word
between
them
pressed
close
together
a
little
song
ran
through
the
play
one
of
burns
most
famous
songs
although
maggie
who
had
never
read
anything
did
not
know
that
the
verses
were
o
my
luve
like
a
red
red
rose
that
newly
sprung
in
june
o
my
luve
like
the
melodie
that
sweetly
played
in
tune
as
fair
art
thou
my
bonnie
lass
so
deep
in
luve
am
i
and
i
will
luve
thee
still
my
dear
till
a
the
seas
gang
dry
till
a
the
seas
gang
dry
my
dear
and
the
rocks
melt
wi
the
sun
i
will
luve
thee
still
my
dear
while
the
sands
o
life
shall
run
and
fare
thee
weel
my
only
luve
and
fare
thee
weel
a
while
and
i
will
come
again
my
luve
tho
it
were
ten
thousand
mile
first
the
handsome
soldier
sang
this
to
the
charity
girl
and
then
because
it
was
a
sentimental
tune
it
was
always
turning
up
through
the
play
and
if
one
of
the
characters
were
not
singing
it
the
orchestra
was
quietly
playing
it
maggie
loved
it
she
was
not
sentimental
but
she
was
simple
and
the
tune
seemed
at
once
to
belong
to
herself
and
to
martin
by
natural
right
as
the
story
developed
it
became
more
unreal
and
maggie
unerring
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
sense
and
nonsense
refused
to
credit
the
tall
handsome
villainness
who
confronted
the
charity
girl
at
the
ball
the
charity
girl
had
no
right
to
be
at
the
ball
and
people
stood
about
in
unnatural
groups
and
pretended
not
to
listen
to
the
loud
development
of
the
plot
and
no
one
seemed
to
use
any
of
their
faculties
then
at
the
end
when
the
gentleman
nobly
surrendered
his
charity
girl
to
the
handsome
soldier
the
little
tune
came
back
again
and
all
was
well
they
came
out
of
the
theatre
into
lights
and
shadows
and
mists
cabs
and
omnibuses
and
crowds
of
people
maggie
clung
to
martin
arm
it
seemed
to
her
dazzled
for
an
instant
that
a
great
are
of
white
piercing
light
cut
the
black
street
and
that
in
the
centre
of
this
arc
a
tree
painted
green
stood
and
round
the
tree
figures
dark
shapes
and
odd
shadows
danced
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
the
long
shining
line
of
shaftesbury
avenue
ran
out
from
her
feet
into
thick
clusters
of
silver
lights
the
tree
had
vanished
and
now
there
were
policemen
and
ladies
in
hats
and
strange
mysterious
houses
she
caught
above
it
all
between
the
roofs
the
pale
flat
river
of
the
evening
sky
and
in
this
river
stars
like
golden
buttons
floated
the
moon
was
there
too
a
round
amber
coin
with
the
laughing
face
stamped
upon
it
what
time
is
it
she
asked
martin
five
he
said
how
early
the
moon
rises
it
only
climbing
now
see
the
chimney
tossing
it
about
i
must
get
home
no
no
he
held
her
arm
fiercely
you
must
come
to
tea
that
part
of
the
programme
we
have
plenty
of
time
before
seven
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
return
something
seemed
to
tell
her
as
she
stood
there
that
now
was
the
moment
to
break
this
off
but
when
his
hand
was
on
her
arm
when
he
was
so
close
to
her
she
could
not
leave
him
she
would
have
one
hour
more
he
took
her
across
the
street
down
into
darkness
up
into
light
then
they
went
into
a
shop
up
some
stairs
and
were
suddenly
in
a
little
room
with
a
table
with
a
cloth
a
window
looking
out
into
the
square
curtains
and
gay
hunting
pictures
on
the
walls
martin
pushed
a
bell
in
the
wall
and
a
stout
waiter
perspiring
smiling
a
napkin
in
his
hand
came
to
the
door
tea
said
martin
and
he
vanished
it
all
right
he
said
drawing
her
to
a
creaking
wicker
armchair
near
the
empty
fireplace
no
one
will
interrupt
us
they
know
me
here
i
ordered
the
room
yesterday
tea
came
but
she
could
not
eat
anything
in
some
strange
way
that
moment
in
the
theatre
when
he
had
pressed
her
hand
had
altered
everything
she
recognised
in
herself
a
new
maggie
she
was
excited
with
a
thick
burning
excitement
she
was
almost
sleepy
with
the
strain
of
it
and
her
cheeks
were
hot
but
her
throat
icy
cold
when
she
told
him
that
she
was
hungry
he
said
i
not
either
then
he
added
not
looking
at
her
that
fellow
wo
be
back
for
an
hour
he
came
and
stood
by
her
looking
down
on
her
he
bent
forward
over
the
chair
and
put
his
hands
under
her
chin
and
pressed
her
face
up
towards
his
but
he
did
not
kiss
her
then
he
took
her
hands
and
pulled
her
gently
out
of
the
chair
sat
down
on
it
himself
then
still
very
tenderly
put
his
arms
round
her
and
drew
her
down
to
him
she
lay
back
against
him
her
cheek
against
his
his
arms
tight
around
her
he
whispered
to
her
again
and
again
darling
darling
darling
she
felt
now
so
terribly
part
of
him
that
she
seemed
to
have
lost
all
her
own
identity
his
hands
softly
tenderly
passed
up
and
down
her
body
stroking
her
hair
her
cheeks
her
arms
her
mouth
was
against
his
cheek
and
she
was
utterly
motionless
shivering
a
little
sometimes
and
once
her
hand
moved
up
and
caught
his
and
then
moved
away
again
at
last
as
it
seemed
from
an
infinite
distance
his
voice
came
to
her
speaking
to
her
maggie
darling
he
said
do
go
back
till
late
you
can
say
that
those
people
asked
you
to
stay
to
dinner
your
aunts
ca
do
anything
nothing
can
happen
stay
with
me
here
and
then
later
we
go
and
have
dinner
at
a
little
place
i
know
and
then
come
back
here
come
back
here
like
this
maggie
darling
say
you
will
you
must
we
may
have
another
chance
for
so
long
you
coming
to
me
afterwards
what
does
it
matter
a
week
or
two
earlier
what
does
it
matter
maggie
stay
here
let
us
love
one
another
and
have
something
to
think
about
to
remember
to
remember
to
remember
his
voice
seemed
to
slip
away
into
infinity
as
voices
in
a
dream
do
she
could
not
say
anything
because
she
was
in
a
dream
too
she
could
only
feel
his
hand
stroking
her
face
he
seemed
to
take
her
silence
for
consent
he
suddenly
kissed
her
furiously
pressing
her
head
back
until
it
hurt
that
woke
her
she
pushed
his
arms
back
and
sprang
up
her
hands
were
trembling
she
shook
her
head
no
martin
no
not
now
why
not
he
looked
at
her
angrily
from
the
chair
his
face
was
altered
he
was
frowning
his
eyes
were
dark
i
not
going
to
stay
now
her
voice
shook
in
spite
of
herself
with
shaking
hands
she
patted
her
dress
why
not
he
asked
again
i
not
i
promised
the
aunts
not
now
it
would
spoil
everything
oh
very
well
he
was
furious
with
her
he
would
meet
her
eyes
not
now
she
felt
that
she
would
cry
tears
flooded
her
eyes
it
been
so
lovely
martin
do
look
like
that
oh
i
love
you
too
much
she
broke
off
with
a
sudden
movement
she
fell
at
his
feet
kneeling
there
she
drew
his
hands
to
her
face
she
kissed
them
the
palms
of
his
hands
over
and
over
again
his
anger
suddenly
left
him
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
first
her
eyes
then
her
cheeks
then
gently
her
mouth
all
right
he
said
only
i
feel
somehow
i
feel
as
though
our
time
had
come
to
an
end
but
it
sha
he
turned
upon
her
fiercely
held
her
hands
looked
in
her
face
maggie
do
you
swear
that
you
love
me
always
whatever
i
am
whatever
i
do
i
swear
she
answered
gazing
into
his
eyes
that
i
love
you
always
whatever
you
are
whatever
you
do
then
she
went
away
leaving
him
by
the
table
staring
after
her
in
the
street
she
saw
that
her
chrysanthemum
was
in
pieces
torn
and
scattered
and
destroyed
she
slipped
off
the
ring
and
put
it
into
her
pocket
then
with
forebodings
in
her
heart
as
though
she
did
indeed
know
that
her
good
time
was
over
she
turned
towards
home
she
was
right
her
good
time
was
over
that
night
she
was
left
alone
martha
let
her
in
and
regarding
her
darkly
said
nothing
the
aunts
also
said
nothing
sitting
all
the
evening
under
the
green
shade
of
the
lamp
in
the
aunt
anne
reading
a
pamphlet
aunt
elizabeth
sewing
maggie
pretended
to
read
but
she
saw
no
words
she
saw
only
the
green
lamp
like
a
dreadful
bird
suspended
there
and
aunt
anne
chiselled
sanctity
over
and
over
again
she
reasoned
with
herself
there
was
no
cause
for
panic
nothing
had
happened
to
change
things
and
yet
and
yet
everything
was
changed
everything
had
been
changed
from
that
moment
when
martin
pressed
her
hand
in
the
theatre
everything
danger
now
of
every
sort
she
could
be
brave
she
could
meet
anything
if
she
were
only
sure
of
martin
but
he
too
seemed
strange
to
her
she
remembered
his
dark
look
his
frown
when
she
had
refused
him
oh
this
loneliness
this
helplessness
if
she
could
be
with
him
beside
him
she
would
fear
nothing
that
night
the
first
faint
suspicion
of
jealousy
of
doubt
an
agonising
dart
of
pain
at
the
knowledge
of
what
it
would
mean
to
her
now
if
he
left
her
stirred
in
her
breast
this
room
was
stifling
she
got
up
from
her
chair
went
to
the
window
looked
out
between
the
thick
curtains
at
the
dark
deserted
street
what
is
it
maggie
nothing
aunt
anne
you
very
restless
dear
it
close
may
i
open
the
door
a
little
dear
she
opened
the
door
and
then
sat
there
hearing
the
armed
men
sway
ever
so
slightly
tap
tap
against
the
wall
in
the
passage
that
night
she
scarcely
slept
at
all
only
tumbling
into
sudden
nightmare
dreams
when
something
had
her
by
the
throat
and
martin
was
not
there
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
she
could
escape
she
hurried
to
piccadilly
martin
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
saw
him
she
realised
at
once
that
her
good
time
was
indeed
over
his
face
was
white
and
strained
he
scarcely
looked
at
her
but
stared
anxiously
up
and
down
the
street
what
is
it
she
asked
breathlessly
look
here
maggie
he
began
still
scarcely
looking
at
her
i
must
get
back
at
once
i
only
came
to
tell
you
that
we
must
drop
our
meetings
for
the
next
day
or
two
until
it
blown
over
until
what
blown
over
she
asked
him
it
my
father
i
do
know
what
exactly
has
happened
they
none
of
them
tell
me
damn
them
it
caroline
smith
she
been
talking
to
amy
about
you
and
me
i
know
that
because
of
what
amy
said
about
you
at
breakfast
this
morning
what
did
she
say
she
would
speak
out
she
hinted
but
she
admitted
that
caroline
smith
had
told
her
something
but
she
does
matter
nothing
matters
except
father
he
must
be
excited
just
now
his
heart
so
bad
any
little
thing
we
must
wait
she
saw
that
he
was
scarcely
realising
her
at
all
she
choked
down
all
questions
that
concerned
themselves
she
simply
agreed
nodding
her
head
he
did
look
at
her
then
smiling
as
he
used
to
do
it
awfully
hard
on
us
it
wo
be
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
but
i
must
put
things
right
at
home
or
it
will
be
all
up
i
do
care
for
the
others
of
course
but
if
anything
happened
to
father
through
me
he
told
her
to
write
to
the
charing
cross
he
would
do
the
same
in
a
day
or
two
it
would
be
all
right
he
pressed
her
hand
and
was
gone
when
she
looked
about
her
the
street
seemed
quite
empty
although
it
was
full
of
people
she
threw
up
her
head
she
would
be
beaten
by
anybody
only
it
was
lonely
going
back
to
the
house
and
all
of
them
alone
without
martin
she
cried
a
little
on
her
way
home
but
they
were
the
last
tears
she
shed
chapter
ix
the
inside
saints
maggie
when
she
was
nearly
home
halted
suddenly
she
stopped
as
when
on
the
threshold
of
a
room
that
should
be
empty
one
sees
waiting
a
stranger
if
at
the
end
of
all
this
she
should
lose
martin
there
was
the
stranger
who
had
come
to
her
now
and
would
not
again
depart
she
recognised
the
sharp
pain
the
almost
unconscious
pulling
back
on
the
sudden
edge
of
a
dim
pit
as
something
that
would
always
be
with
her
now
always
one
knows
that
in
the
second
stage
of
a
great
intimacy
one
essential
loneliness
is
only
redoubled
by
close
companionship
one
asks
for
so
much
more
and
then
more
and
more
but
that
final
embrace
is
elusive
and
no
physical
contact
can
surrender
it
but
she
was
young
and
did
not
know
that
yet
all
she
knew
was
that
she
would
have
to
face
these
immediate
troubles
alone
that
she
would
not
see
him
for
perhaps
a
week
that
she
would
not
know
what
his
people
at
home
were
doing
and
that
she
must
not
let
any
of
these
thoughts
come
up
into
her
brain
she
must
keep
them
all
back
if
she
did
not
she
would
tumble
into
some
foolish
precipitate
action
when
she
reached
home
she
was
obstinate
and
determined
at
once
she
found
that
something
was
the
matter
during
luncheon
the
two
aunts
sat
like
statues
aunt
elizabeth
a
dumpy
and
squat
one
aunt
aloofness
was
coloured
now
with
a
very
human
anger
maggie
realised
with
surprise
that
she
had
never
seen
her
angry
before
she
had
been
indignant
disapproving
superior
forbidding
but
never
angry
the
eyes
were
hard
now
not
with
religious
reserve
but
simply
with
bad
temper
the
mist
of
anger
dimmed
the
room
it
was
in
the
potatoes
and
the
cold
dry
mutton
especially
was
it
in
the
hard
pallid
knobs
of
cheese
and
aunt
elizabeth
although
she
was
frightened
by
her
anger
on
this
occasion
shared
in
it
she
pursed
her
lips
at
maggie
and
moved
her
fat
podgy
hand
as
though
she
would
like
to
smack
cheeks
maggie
was
frightened
really
frightened
the
line
of
bold
independence
was
all
very
well
but
now
risks
were
attached
to
it
if
she
swiftly
tossed
her
head
and
told
her
aunts
that
she
would
walk
out
of
the
house
they
might
say
walk
and
that
would
precipitate
martin
crisis
she
knew
from
the
way
he
had
looked
at
her
that
morning
that
his
thoughts
were
with
his
father
and
it
showed
that
she
had
travelled
through
the
first
stage
of
her
intimacy
with
him
that
she
could
not
trust
him
to
put
her
before
his
own
family
troubles
at
all
costs
she
must
keep
him
safe
through
these
next
difficult
weeks
and
the
best
way
to
keep
him
safe
was
herself
to
remain
quietly
at
home
of
all
this
she
thought
as
she
swallowed
the
hostile
knobs
of
cheese
and
drank
the
tepid
gritty
coffee
she
followed
her
aunts
upstairs
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
aunt
elizabeth
with
an
agitated
murmur
vanished
into
higher
regions
she
followed
aunt
anne
into
the
aunt
anne
sat
in
the
tapestry
chair
by
the
fire
maggie
stood
in
front
of
her
she
was
disarmed
at
that
moment
by
her
desperate
sensation
of
defenceless
loneliness
it
was
as
though
half
of
herself
the
of
herself
had
left
her
she
tried
to
summon
her
pluck
but
there
was
no
pluck
there
she
could
only
want
martin
over
and
over
again
inside
herself
had
any
one
been
ever
so
hopelessly
alone
before
maggie
i
am
angry
said
aunt
anne
she
said
it
as
though
she
meant
it
amazing
how
human
this
strange
aloof
creature
had
become
as
though
some
coloured
saint
bright
with
painted
wood
and
tinsel
before
whom
one
stood
in
reverence
slipped
down
suddenly
and
with
fingers
of
flesh
and
blood
struck
one
face
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
beautiful
hands
were
no
longer
thin
but
were
hard
and
active
what
have
i
done
aunt
asked
maggie
you
have
not
treated
us
fairly
my
sister
and
i
have
done
everything
for
you
you
have
not
made
it
especially
easy
for
us
in
any
way
but
we
have
tried
to
give
you
what
you
wanted
you
have
repaid
is
with
ingratitude
she
paused
but
maggie
said
nothing
she
went
on
lately
these
last
three
weeks
we
have
given
you
complete
liberty
i
advised
that
strongly
against
my
sister
opinion
because
i
thought
you
were
happy
you
did
make
friends
amongst
our
friends
and
i
thought
you
should
have
the
chance
of
finding
some
who
were
younger
and
gayer
than
we
were
then
i
thought
we
could
trust
you
you
have
many
faults
but
i
believed
that
you
were
honest
i
am
honest
maggie
broke
in
her
aunt
went
on
you
have
used
the
liberty
we
gave
you
during
these
weeks
to
make
yourself
the
talk
of
our
friends
you
have
been
meeting
martin
warlock
secretly
every
day
you
have
been
alone
with
him
in
the
park
and
at
the
theatre
i
know
that
you
are
young
and
very
ignorant
you
could
not
have
known
that
martin
warlock
is
a
man
with
whom
no
girl
who
respects
herself
would
be
seen
alone
that
is
untrue
maggie
flamed
and
went
on
aunt
anne
we
would
have
forgiven
that
it
is
your
deceit
to
ourselves
that
we
can
not
forget
day
after
day
you
were
meeting
him
and
pretending
that
you
went
to
your
other
friends
i
am
disappointed
in
you
bitterly
disappointed
i
saw
from
the
first
that
you
did
not
mean
to
care
for
us
now
as
well
you
have
disgraced
us
maggie
began
yes
i
have
been
seeing
martin
i
did
think
it
wrong
i
do
now
i
did
tell
you
because
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
stop
me
then
that
shows
that
you
knew
it
was
wrong
no
aunt
anne
only
that
you
would
think
it
was
wrong
i
can
only
go
by
myself
by
what
i
feel
is
wrong
i
mean
i
always
had
to
all
my
life
it
would
have
been
no
good
doing
anything
else
at
home
because
father
she
pulled
herself
up
she
was
not
going
to
defend
herself
or
ask
for
pity
she
said
speaking
finally
yes
i
have
been
out
with
martin
every
day
i
went
to
the
theatre
with
him
too
and
also
had
tea
with
him
maggie
could
see
aunt
anne
anger
rising
higher
and
higher
like
water
in
a
tube
her
voice
was
hard
when
she
spoke
again
she
pronounced
judgment
we
see
now
that
you
were
right
when
you
said
that
you
had
better
leave
us
you
are
free
to
go
as
soon
as
you
wish
you
have
of
course
your
money
but
if
you
care
to
stay
with
us
until
you
have
found
some
work
you
must
now
obey
our
rules
while
you
remain
with
us
you
must
not
go
out
unless
my
sister
or
i
accompany
you
then
her
voice
changed
softening
a
little
she
suddenly
raised
her
hands
in
a
gesture
of
appeal
oh
maggie
maggie
turn
to
god
you
have
rebelled
against
him
you
have
refused
to
listen
to
his
voice
the
end
of
that
can
be
only
misery
he
loves
but
he
also
judges
even
now
within
a
day
a
week
he
may
come
with
judgment
turn
to
him
maggie
not
because
i
tell
you
but
because
of
the
truth
pray
with
me
now
that
he
may
help
you
and
give
you
strength
because
she
felt
that
she
had
indeed
treated
them
badly
and
must
do
just
now
what
they
wished
she
knelt
down
on
the
carpet
aunt
anne
also
knelt
down
her
figure
stiff
like
iron
her
raised
hands
once
again
delicate
and
o
lord
god
she
prayed
this
thy
servant
comes
to
thee
and
prays
that
thou
wilt
give
her
strength
in
her
struggle
with
the
evil
one
she
has
been
tempted
and
is
weak
but
thou
art
strong
to
save
and
wilt
not
despise
the
least
of
these
thy
children
come
o
lord
the
father
and
take
thy
daughter
into
thy
loving
care
and
when
thou
comest
in
all
thy
splendour
to
redeem
the
world
i
pray
that
thou
wilt
find
her
waiting
for
thee
in
holiness
and
meekness
of
heart
they
rose
maggie
knees
were
sore
with
the
stiff
carpet
the
family
group
watched
her
from
the
wall
ironically
she
saw
that
in
spite
of
the
prayer
aunt
anne
had
not
forgiven
her
she
stood
away
from
her
and
although
her
voice
now
was
not
so
hard
it
had
lost
altogether
the
tender
note
that
it
used
to
have
now
maggie
you
must
promise
us
that
you
will
not
see
martin
warlock
again
maggie
flushed
no
aunt
i
ca
promise
that
then
we
must
treat
you
as
a
prisoner
whilst
you
are
with
us
if
he
wants
to
see
me
i
must
see
him
they
looked
at
one
another
aunt
anne
was
like
a
man
just
then
very
well
until
you
give
us
your
promise
we
must
see
ourselves
that
you
do
not
disgrace
us
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
it
was
as
though
a
heavy
iron
door
had
rolled
to
aunt
anne
passed
maggie
and
left
the
room
well
then
there
was
the
situation
as
she
remained
in
the
empty
room
she
felt
relief
because
now
she
knew
where
she
was
if
only
she
could
keep
in
touch
with
martin
then
nothing
else
at
all
mattered
but
that
must
be
otherwise
she
felt
that
she
would
rush
at
them
all
and
tread
them
down
and
break
doors
and
windows
to
get
at
him
meanwhile
how
they
must
all
have
been
talking
she
felt
no
especial
anger
against
caroline
smith
it
had
been
her
own
fault
for
trusting
that
note
to
her
honour
caroline
had
no
honour
of
course
maggie
might
have
guessed
that
from
the
way
that
she
talked
about
other
people
and
then
probably
she
herself
was
in
love
with
martin
she
sat
down
staring
in
front
of
her
thinking
they
all
knew
amy
warlock
thurston
miss
avies
knew
about
that
wonderful
marvellous
thing
her
love
for
martin
his
for
her
they
were
turning
it
over
in
their
hands
soiling
it
laughing
at
it
sneering
at
it
and
what
were
they
doing
to
martin
at
that
thought
she
sprang
up
and
began
hurriedly
to
walk
about
oh
they
must
leave
him
alone
what
were
they
saying
to
him
they
were
telling
him
how
ridiculous
it
was
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
plain
ugly
girl
and
he
was
he
defending
her
at
the
sudden
suggestion
of
his
disloyalty
indignation
fought
in
her
with
some
strange
horrible
suspicion
yes
it
would
come
back
that
thought
he
was
weak
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
he
was
weak
she
knew
that
he
was
she
would
not
lie
to
herself
and
then
at
the
thought
of
his
weakness
the
maternal
love
in
her
that
was
the
strongest
instinct
in
her
character
flooded
her
body
and
soul
so
that
she
did
not
mind
if
he
were
weak
but
only
wanted
to
defend
him
to
protect
him
strangely
she
felt
more
sure
of
him
at
that
moment
when
she
was
conscious
of
his
weakness
than
she
had
been
when
she
asserted
his
strength
beneath
that
weakness
he
would
be
true
to
her
because
he
needed
her
no
one
else
could
give
him
what
she
did
he
had
said
so
again
and
again
and
it
would
always
be
so
he
would
have
to
come
back
to
her
however
often
he
denied
her
she
felt
happier
then
she
could
face
them
all
she
had
been
bad
to
her
aunts
too
she
had
done
them
harm
and
they
had
been
nothing
but
goodness
to
her
apart
from
leaving
martin
she
would
do
all
these
next
weeks
to
please
them
she
went
up
to
her
bedroom
and
when
she
reached
it
she
realised
with
a
little
pang
of
fright
that
she
was
a
prisoner
no
more
meetings
outside
hatchards
no
more
teas
no
more
walks
she
looked
out
of
the
window
down
into
the
street
it
was
a
long
way
down
and
the
figures
walking
were
puppets
not
human
at
all
but
the
thing
to
be
thought
of
now
was
the
question
of
letters
how
was
she
to
get
them
to
the
strand
office
and
receive
from
them
martin
letters
in
return
after
long
anxious
thought
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
way
there
was
a
jane
who
came
every
morning
to
the
house
did
odd
jobs
in
the
kitchen
and
went
home
again
in
the
evening
maggie
had
seen
the
girl
about
the
house
a
number
of
times
had
noticed
her
for
her
rebellious
independent
look
and
had
felt
some
sympathy
with
her
because
she
was
under
the
harsh
dominion
of
martha
maggie
had
spoken
to
her
once
or
twice
and
the
girl
had
seemed
grateful
smiling
in
a
kind
of
dark
tearful
way
under
her
untidy
hair
maggie
believed
that
she
would
help
her
of
course
the
girl
would
get
into
trouble
were
she
discovered
and
dismissal
would
certainly
follow
but
it
was
clear
enough
that
she
would
not
in
any
case
be
under
martha
government
very
long
martha
never
kept
for
more
than
a
month
at
a
time
she
sat
down
at
once
and
wrote
her
first
letter
sitting
on
her
bed
darling
martin
there
has
been
an
explosion
here
the
aunts
have
told
me
to
give
you
up
i
could
not
promise
them
that
i
would
not
see
you
and
so
i
am
a
prisoner
here
until
i
leave
them
altogether
i
leave
them
until
after
the
new
year
partly
because
i
gave
a
promise
and
partly
because
it
would
make
more
trouble
for
you
if
i
were
turned
out
just
now
i
ca
leave
the
house
at
all
unless
i
am
with
one
of
them
so
i
am
going
to
try
and
send
the
letters
by
the
here
who
goes
home
every
day
and
she
will
fetch
yours
when
she
posts
mine
i
give
her
a
note
to
tell
the
post
people
that
she
is
to
have
them
martin
dear
try
and
write
every
day
even
if
it
only
the
shortest
line
because
it
is
dreadful
to
be
shut
up
all
day
and
i
think
of
you
all
the
time
and
wonder
how
you
are
do
be
unhappy
martin
that
the
one
thing
i
could
bear
if
you
not
i
not
there
no
reason
to
be
unhappy
about
me
i
very
cheerful
indeed
if
i
know
that
you
are
all
right
you
are
all
right
are
you
i
do
want
to
know
what
happened
when
you
got
home
i
quite
understand
that
the
one
thing
you
must
do
now
is
to
keep
your
father
well
and
not
let
anything
trouble
him
if
the
thought
of
me
troubles
him
then
tell
him
that
you
are
thinking
of
nothing
but
him
now
and
how
to
make
him
happy
but
do
let
them
change
your
feeling
for
me
you
know
me
better
than
any
of
them
do
and
i
am
just
as
you
know
me
every
bit
the
aunts
are
very
angry
because
they
say
i
deceived
them
but
they
have
any
right
to
tell
me
who
i
shall
love
have
they
no
one
has
i
am
myself
and
nobody
ever
cared
for
me
except
you
and
uncle
mathew
so
i
do
see
why
i
should
think
of
anybody
the
aunts
never
cared
for
me
really
only
to
make
me
religious
but
martin
never
forget
i
love
you
so
much
i
can
never
change
not
one
who
changes
and
although
i
young
now
i
shall
be
just
the
same
when
i
old
i
have
the
ring
and
i
look
at
it
all
the
time
i
like
to
think
you
have
the
locket
please
write
dear
martin
or
find
it
very
difficult
to
stay
quiet
here
and
i
know
i
ought
to
stay
quiet
for
your
sake
your
loving
maggie
she
put
it
in
an
envelope
wrote
the
address
as
he
had
told
her
and
then
set
out
to
find
jane
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
now
and
the
house
on
this
winter
day
was
dark
and
dim
the
gas
was
always
badly
lit
in
the
passages
spitting
and
muttering
like
an
imprisoned
animal
the
house
was
so
quiet
when
maggie
came
out
on
to
the
stairs
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
in
it
she
found
her
way
down
into
the
hall
and
saw
thomas
the
cat
there
moving
like
a
black
ghost
along
the
floor
he
came
up
to
her
and
rubbed
himself
in
his
sinister
mysterious
way
against
her
dress
when
she
turned
towards
the
green
baize
door
that
led
towards
the
kitchen
regions
he
stood
back
from
her
stole
on
to
the
lower
steps
of
the
staircase
and
watched
her
with
steady
unblinking
eyes
she
pushed
the
door
and
went
through
into
the
cold
passage
that
smelt
of
cheese
and
bacon
and
damp
earth
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
about
and
then
suddenly
the
pantry
door
opened
and
jane
came
out
she
stopped
when
she
saw
maggie
where
martha
asked
maggie
in
a
low
voice
the
whisper
seemed
to
tell
jane
at
once
that
this
was
to
be
a
confidential
matter
she
jerked
with
a
dirty
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
in
there
cooking
the
dinner
she
whispered
back
she
was
untidy
there
were
streaks
of
black
on
her
face
but
her
eyes
looked
up
at
maggie
with
a
friendly
roguish
glance
as
though
they
had
already
something
in
common
maggie
saw
that
she
had
no
time
to
lose
she
came
close
to
her
jane
she
said
i
in
trouble
it
only
you
who
can
help
me
here
a
letter
that
i
want
posted
just
in
the
ordinary
way
can
you
do
that
for
me
jane
suddenly
smiling
nodded
her
head
and
there
something
else
maggie
went
on
morning
before
you
come
here
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
strand
you
know
the
one
opposite
the
station
and
ask
for
a
letter
addressed
to
me
i
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
here
that
you
to
be
given
any
letters
of
mine
give
it
to
me
somehow
when
no
one
looking
do
you
understand
jane
nodded
her
head
maggie
gave
her
the
note
and
also
but
jane
pushed
back
the
money
i
do
want
no
money
she
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
you
the
only
one
here
decent
to
me
at
that
moment
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
martha
appeared
when
she
saw
jane
she
came
up
to
her
and
said
now
then
idling
again
what
about
the
potatoes
she
looked
at
maggie
with
her
usual
surly
suspicion
i
came
down
for
a
candle
maggie
said
for
my
room
will
you
give
me
one
please
jane
had
vanished
martin
meanwhile
after
maggie
left
him
had
returned
home
in
no
happy
state
there
had
leapt
upon
him
again
that
mood
of
sullen
impatient
rebellion
that
he
knew
so
well
a
mood
that
really
was
like
a
possession
so
that
struggle
as
he
might
he
seemed
always
in
the
grip
of
some
menacing
figure
it
was
possession
in
a
sense
that
to
many
normal
happy
people
in
this
world
is
so
utterly
unknown
that
they
can
only
scornfully
name
it
weakness
and
so
pass
on
their
way
but
those
human
beings
who
have
suffered
from
it
do
in
very
truth
feel
as
though
they
had
been
caught
up
into
another
world
a
world
of
slavery
moral
with
a
master
high
above
them
driving
them
with
a
lash
that
their
chained
limbs
may
not
resist
such
men
if
they
try
to
explain
that
torment
can
often
point
to
the
very
day
and
even
hour
of
their
sudden
slavery
at
such
a
tick
of
the
clock
the
clouds
gather
the
very
houses
and
street
are
weighted
with
a
cold
malignity
thoughts
desires
impulses
are
all
checked
perverted
driven
and
by
a
mysterious
force
let
no
man
who
has
not
known
such
hours
and
the
terror
of
such
a
dominion
utter
judgment
upon
his
neighbour
to
martin
the
threat
of
this
conflict
with
his
father
over
maggie
was
the
one
crisis
that
he
had
wished
to
avoid
but
his
character
which
was
naturally
easy
and
friendly
and
unsuspicious
had
confused
him
those
three
weeks
with
maggie
had
been
so
happy
so
free
from
all
morbidity
and
complication
that
he
had
forgotten
the
world
outside
for
a
moment
when
maggie
had
told
him
that
she
had
given
her
note
to
caroline
he
had
been
afraid
but
he
had
been
lulled
as
the
days
passed
and
nothing
interfered
with
their
security
now
he
was
suddenly
plunged
into
the
middle
of
a
confusion
that
was
all
the
more
complicated
because
he
could
not
tell
what
his
mother
and
his
sister
were
thinking
he
knew
that
amy
had
disliked
him
ever
since
his
return
and
that
that
dislike
had
been
changed
into
something
fiercer
since
his
declared
opposition
to
thurston
his
mother
he
simply
did
not
understand
at
all
she
spoke
to
him
still
with
the
same
affection
and
tenderness
but
behind
the
words
he
felt
a
hard
purpose
and
a
mysterious
aloofness
she
was
not
like
his
mother
at
all
it
was
as
though
some
spy
had
been
introduced
into
the
house
in
his
mother
clothing
but
for
them
he
did
not
care
it
was
his
father
of
whom
he
must
think
here
too
there
was
a
mystery
from
which
he
was
deliberately
kept
he
knew
of
course
that
they
were
all
expecting
some
crisis
as
the
days
advanced
he
could
feel
that
the
excitement
increased
he
knew
that
his
father
had
declared
that
he
had
visions
and
that
there
was
to
be
a
revelation
very
shortly
but
of
these
visions
and
this
revelation
he
heard
only
indirectly
from
others
his
father
said
nothing
to
him
of
these
things
and
at
the
ordinary
chapel
services
on
sunday
there
was
no
allusion
to
them
he
knew
that
the
inside
saints
had
a
society
and
rules
of
their
own
inside
the
larger
body
and
from
that
inner
society
he
was
quite
definitely
excluded
of
that
exclusion
he
would
have
been
only
too
glad
had
it
not
been
for
his
father
but
now
when
he
saw
him
growing
from
day
to
day
more
haggard
and
worn
more
aloof
from
all
human
society
when
lie
saw
him
wrapped
further
and
further
into
some
strange
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
insane
absorption
he
was
determined
to
fight
his
way
into
the
heart
of
it
his
growing
intimacy
with
maggie
had
relieved
him
for
a
moment
of
the
intensity
of
this
other
anxiety
now
suddenly
he
was
flung
back
into
the
very
thick
of
it
his
earlier
plan
of
forcing
his
father
out
of
all
this
network
of
chicanery
and
charlatanism
now
returned
he
felt
that
if
he
could
only
seize
his
father
and
forcibly
abduct
him
and
take
him
away
from
amy
and
thurston
and
the
rest
and
all
the
associations
of
the
chapel
he
might
cure
him
and
lead
him
back
to
health
and
happiness
again
and
yet
he
did
not
know
he
had
not
himself
escaped
from
it
all
by
leaving
it
and
then
that
undermining
bewildering
suspicion
that
perhaps
after
all
there
was
something
in
all
of
this
that
it
was
not
only
charlatanism
confused
and
disconcerted
him
he
was
like
a
man
who
hears
sounds
and
faint
cries
behind
a
thick
wall
and
there
are
no
doors
and
windows
and
the
bricks
are
too
stout
to
be
torn
apart
he
had
been
behind
that
wall
all
his
life
amy
allusion
to
maggie
in
the
morning
had
been
very
slight
but
had
shown
quite
clearly
that
she
had
heard
all
and
probably
more
than
the
truth
when
he
returned
that
morning
he
found
his
mother
alone
knitting
a
pink
woollen
comforter
her
gold
spectacles
on
the
end
of
her
nose
her
fresh
lace
cap
crisp
and
dainty
on
her
white
hair
the
very
picture
of
the
dearest
old
lady
in
the
world
mother
he
began
at
once
what
did
amy
mean
this
morning
about
myself
and
maggie
cardinal
maggie
who
dear
his
mother
asked
maggie
cardinal
the
cardinal
niece
you
know
he
said
impatiently
did
she
say
anything
i
do
remember
yes
mother
you
remember
perfectly
well
she
said
that
they
were
all
talking
about
me
and
maggie
did
she
the
old
lady
slowly
counted
her
stitches
well
dear
i
should
worry
about
what
they
all
say
whoever
may
be
oh
i
do
care
for
that
he
answered
contemptuously
although
all
the
same
i
not
going
to
have
amy
running
that
girl
down
she
been
against
her
from
the
first
what
i
want
to
know
is
has
amy
been
to
father
with
this
because
if
she
has
i
going
to
stop
it
i
not
going
to
have
her
bothering
father
with
bits
of
gossip
that
picked
up
by
listening
behind
other
peoples
amy
meanwhile
had
come
in
and
heard
this
last
sentence
thank
you
martin
she
said
quietly
he
turned
to
her
with
fury
what
did
you
mean
at
breakfast
he
asked
by
what
you
said
about
myself
and
maggie
cardinal
she
looked
at
him
with
contempt
but
no
very
active
hostility
i
was
simply
telling
you
something
that
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
she
said
it
is
what
everybody
is
saying
that
you
and
she
have
been
meeting
every
day
for
weeks
sitting
in
the
park
after
dark
together
going
to
the
theatre
people
draw
their
own
conclusions
i
suppose
how
much
have
you
told
father
of
this
he
demanded
i
do
know
at
all
what
father
has
heard
she
answered
you
been
that
girl
enemy
since
the
first
moment
that
she
came
here
he
continued
growing
angrier
and
angrier
at
her
quiet
indifference
now
you
trying
to
damage
her
character
on
the
contrary
she
answered
i
told
you
because
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
what
people
were
saying
the
girl
does
matter
to
me
one
way
or
another
but
i
sorry
for
her
if
she
thinks
she
cares
for
you
that
wo
bring
her
much
happiness
then
suddenly
her
impassivity
had
a
strange
effect
upon
him
he
could
not
answer
her
he
left
them
both
and
went
up
to
his
room
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
of
his
bedroom
he
knew
that
his
bad
time
was
come
upon
him
it
was
a
physical
as
well
as
a
spiritual
dominion
the
room
visibly
darkened
before
his
eyes
his
brain
worked
as
it
would
in
dreams
suggesting
its
own
thoughts
and
wishes
and
intentions
a
dark
shadow
hung
over
him
hands
were
placed
upon
his
eyes
only
one
thought
came
before
him
again
and
again
and
again
you
know
you
have
long
known
that
you
are
doomed
to
make
miserable
everything
that
you
touch
to
ruin
every
one
with
whom
you
come
in
contact
that
is
your
fate
and
you
can
no
more
escape
from
it
than
you
can
escape
from
your
body
how
many
hours
of
this
kind
he
had
known
in
spain
in
france
in
south
america
often
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
thought
that
he
was
at
last
settling
down
to
some
decent
steady
plan
of
life
he
would
be
jerked
from
his
purpose
some
delay
or
failure
would
frustrate
him
and
there
would
follow
the
voice
in
his
ear
and
the
hands
on
his
eyes
it
was
indeed
as
though
he
had
been
pledged
to
something
in
his
early
life
and
because
he
had
broken
from
that
pledge
had
been
pursued
ever
since
he
stripped
to
the
waist
and
bathed
in
cold
water
even
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
flesh
was
heavy
and
dull
and
yellow
that
he
was
growing
obese
and
out
of
all
condition
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
collar
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
tried
to
think
the
thing
out
to
whomsoever
he
had
done
harm
in
the
past
he
would
now
spare
maggie
and
his
father
he
was
surprised
at
the
rush
of
tenderness
that
came
over
him
at
the
thought
of
maggie
he
sat
there
for
some
time
thinking
over
every
incident
of
the
last
three
weeks
that
at
least
had
been
a
good
decent
time
and
no
one
could
ever
take
it
away
from
them
again
he
looked
at
her
picture
in
the
locket
and
realised
as
he
looked
at
it
a
link
with
her
that
he
had
never
felt
with
any
woman
before
all
the
same
he
thought
i
should
go
away
she
mind
it
at
first
but
not
half
as
much
as
she
mind
me
later
on
when
she
saw
what
kind
of
a
chap
i
really
was
she
be
unhappy
for
a
bit
but
she
soon
meet
some
one
else
she
never
seen
a
man
yet
except
me
she
soon
forget
me
such
a
kid
nevertheless
when
he
thought
of
beginning
that
old
wandering
life
again
he
shrank
back
he
had
hated
it
oh
how
he
hated
it
and
he
want
to
leave
maggie
he
was
in
reality
beginning
to
believe
that
with
her
he
might
pull
himself
right
out
of
this
morass
of
weakness
and
indecision
in
which
he
had
been
wallowing
for
years
and
yet
what
sort
of
a
life
could
he
offer
her
he
did
not
believe
that
he
would
ever
now
be
able
to
find
this
other
woman
whom
he
had
married
and
until
he
had
found
her
and
divorced
her
maggie
position
would
be
impossible
she
knowing
nothing
of
the
world
could
disregard
it
but
he
knew
knew
that
daily
hourly
recurrence
of
alights
and
insults
and
disappointments
knew
what
that
life
could
make
after
a
time
of
women
in
such
a
position
even
though
she
did
not
mind
he
would
mind
for
her
and
would
reproach
himself
continually
no
it
was
impossible
he
must
go
away
secretly
without
telling
her
then
at
that
he
was
pulled
up
again
by
the
thought
of
his
father
he
could
not
leave
him
until
this
crisis
whatever
it
might
be
was
over
a
very
little
thing
now
might
kill
him
and
at
the
thought
of
that
possibility
he
jumped
up
from
his
bed
and
swore
that
that
catastrophe
at
least
must
be
prevented
his
father
must
live
and
be
happy
and
strong
again
and
he
martin
must
see
to
it
that
was
his
charge
and
his
sacred
duty
above
all
else
strong
in
this
thought
he
went
down
to
his
father
room
he
knocked
on
the
door
there
was
no
answer
and
he
went
in
the
room
was
in
a
mess
of
untidiness
his
father
was
walking
up
and
down
staring
in
front
of
him
talking
to
himself
at
the
sound
of
the
door
he
turned
saw
martin
and
smiled
the
old
trusting
smile
of
a
child
that
had
been
during
his
time
abroad
martin
clearest
memory
of
him
oh
is
that
you
come
in
martin
came
forward
and
his
father
put
his
arm
round
his
neck
as
though
for
support
i
tired
horribly
tired
martin
took
him
to
the
shabby
broken
and
made
him
sit
down
himself
sat
in
his
old
place
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
his
hand
against
his
father
neck
father

a
week

martin
he
suddenly
looked
up
at
his
son
putting
his
hand
on
his
knee

should
be
good
like
you
used
to
be
when
you
were
a
boy
father
what
have
people
been
saying
to
you
about
me
nothing
nothing
only
i
think
about
you
so
much
i
pray
about
you
all
the
time
soon
as
you
say
we
go
away
together
only
now
just
now
i
want
you
with
me
here
strong
by
my
side
i
want
your
help
martin
took
his
father
hand
felt
how
dry
and
hot
and
feverish
it
was
i
be
with
you
he
said
i
promise
that
do
you
listen
to
what
any
one
says
i
wo
leave
you
he
would
like
to
have
gone
on
and
asked
other
questions
but
the
old
man
seemed
so
worn
out
and
exhausted
that
he
was
afraid
of
distressing
him
so
he
just
sat
there
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
suddenly
the
white
head
nodded
the
beard
sank
over
the
breast
and
huddled
up
in
the
chair
as
though
life
itself
had
left
him
the
old
man
slept
during
the
next
four
days
martin
and
maggie
corresponded
through
the
fair
hands
of
jane
he
wrote
only
short
letters
and
over
them
he
struggled
he
seemed
to
see
maggie
through
a
tangled
mist
of
persons
and
motives
and
intentions
he
could
not
get
at
the
real
maggie
at
all
he
could
not
even
get
at
his
real
feelings
about
her
he
knew
that
these
letters
were
not
enough
for
her
he
could
feel
behind
her
own
a
longing
for
something
from
him
more
definite
something
that
would
bring
her
closer
to
him
he
was
haunted
by
his
picture
of
her
sitting
in
that
dismal
house
a
prisoner
waiting
for
him
and
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
four
days
he
felt
that
he
must
in
some
way
or
other
see
her
then
she
herself
proposed
a
way
night
friday
she
wrote
the
aunts
are
going
to
a
meeting
they
wo
return
until
after
eight
during
most
of
that
time
martha
will
be
in
the
kitchen
cooking
and
jane
who
is
staying
late
that
night
has
promised
to
give
me
a
signal
i
could
run
out
for
quarter
of
an
hour
and
meet
you
somewhere
close
by
and
risk
getting
back
jane
will
be
ready
to
let
me
in
of
course
it
may
fail
but
things
ca
be
worse
than
they
are
i
absolutely
forbid
you
to
come
if
you
think
that
this
can
make
anything
worse
for
you
at
home
but
i
must
see
you
martin
i
feel
as
though
i
stand
it
any
longer
although
i
only
had
five
days
of
it
but
i
think
that
if
i
met
you
really
you
for
only
five
minutes
i
could
bear
it
then
for
weeks
let
me
know
if
you
agree
to
this
and
if
so
where
we
could
meet
about
the
mere
thought
of
seeing
her
was
wonderful
he
would
not
have
believed
a
month
ago
that
it
could
have
come
to
mean
so
much
to
him
he
wrote
back
yes
at
the
corner
of
dundas
street
by
the
pillar
box
he
knew
that
she
had
been
to
that
dark
little
street
with
her
aunts
to
see
miss
pyncheon
the
night
when
it
came
was
misty
and
when
he
reached
the
place
she
was
at
once
in
his
arms
she
had
been
there
more
than
five
minutes
she
had
thought
that
he
was
not
coming
martha
had
nearly
caught
her
he
kissed
her
hair
and
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
holding
her
to
him
forgetting
everything
but
her
she
stayed
quiet
clinging
to
him
as
though
she
would
never
let
him
go
then
she
drew
away
now
we
must
walk
about
or
some
one
will
see
us
she
said
we
only
got
five
minutes
martin
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
you
happy
yes
he
said
they
walked
like
ghosts
in
the
misty
street
well
then
i
am
she
said
only
your
letters
did
sound
very
happy
can
you
hold
on
till
after
the
new
year
they
were
walking
hand
in
hand
her
fingers
curled
in
his
palm
yes
she
said
if
you
happy
there
are
troubles
of
course
he
said
but
i
do
care
for
amy
and
the
rest
it
only
father
that
matters
i
ca
discover
how
much
he
knows
if
i
knew
that
i
be
much
happier
we
be
all
right
maggie
if
nothing
happens
to
him
with
a
little
frightened
catch
in
her
throat
she
asked
him
how
do
you
mean
if
anything
happens
to
him
if
anything
happened
to
him
she
could
feel
his
hand
stiffen
round
hers
through
me
then
why
then
i
leave
you
everything
i
have
to
leave
me
oh
martin
no
i
go
i
go
i
do
know
where
to
i
do
know
what
i
do
know
then
that
i
must
leave
every
one
alone
always
for
ever
especially
you
no
you
need
me
more
than
ever
you
do
understand
maggie
i
be
impossible
after
that
if
father
suffered
through
me
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
the
end
of
everything
martin
listen
she
caught
his
arm
looking
up
trying
to
see
his
face
if
anything
like
that
did
happen
that
would
be
where
you
want
me
do
you
see
that
you
could
harm
me
except
by
leaving
me
you
can
reason
it
as
you
like
maggie
but
i
know
myself
i
know
the
impulse
would
be
too
strong
to
go
away
and
hide
myself
from
everybody
i
felt
it
before
when
i
done
something
especially
bad
something
in
me
that
i
known
all
my
life
then
he
turned
to
her
but
it
all
right
nothing
shall
happen
to
the
old
man
i
see
that
it
does
we
only
got
to
wait
a
fortnight
then
i
get
him
away
for
a
holiday
and
once
he
better
i
can
leave
him
it
will
be
all
right
it
shall
then
he
bent
down
to
her
you
know
maggie
i
love
you
more
far
more
than
i
ever
thought
even
if
i
went
away
you
be
the
only
one
love
i
never
dreamt
that
i
care
for
any
one
so
much
he
felt
her
tremble
under
his
hand
when
he
said
that
she
sighed
now
i
can
go
back
she
said
i
say
that
over
to
myself
again
and
again
they
stayed
a
little
longer
he
put
his
arms
round
her
again
and
held
her
so
close
to
him
that
she
could
feel
his
heart
throbbing
then
when
they
had
kissed
once
more
she
went
away
she
returned
safely
jane
opened
the
door
for
her
mysteriously
as
though
she
enjoyed
her
share
in
the
conspiracy
maggie
sped
upstairs
and
now
with
martin
words
in
her
ears
had
enough
to
stiffen
her
back
for
the
battle
the
next
move
in
the
affair
was
on
the
following
afternoon
when
maggie
alone
in
the
beheld
caroline
smith
in
the
doorway
she
got
cheek
enough
for
anything
was
maggie
first
thought
but
she
was
not
aware
of
the
true
magnificence
of
that
young
audacity
until
she
found
her
hand
seized
and
her
cheek
kissed
caroline
in
fact
had
greeted
her
with
precisely
her
old
spontaneous
enthusiasm
maggie
darling
where
have
you
been
all
these
days
but
weeks
it
is
indeed
you
might
at
least
have
sent
me
just
a
word
life
simply
been
the
same
without
you
you
pet
and
you
look
tired
yes
you
do
you
been
overworking
or
something
all
because
you
have
had
me
to
look
after
you
maggie
gravely
withdrew
and
standing
away
from
the
shining
elegance
of
her
friend
said
caroline
i
want
to
know
something
before
we
go
any
further
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
did
you
read
that
note
that
i
asked
you
to
give
to
martin
warlock
caroline
stared
in
amazement
my
dear
what
is
the
matter
are
you
ill
or
something
oh
you
are
i
can
see
you
are
you
poor
darling
read
your
note
what
note
dear
the
note
i
gave
you
a
month
ago
one
evening
when
you
were
here
a
note
a
month
ago
my
dear
as
though
i
could
ever
remember
what
i
did
a
month
ago
why
it
always
all
i
can
manage
to
remember
what
i
did
yesterday
did
you
give
me
a
note
dear
maggie
began
to
be
angry
of
course
i
did
you
remember
perfectly
well
i
gave
it
to
you
for
martin
warlock
you
let
him
have
it
but
meanwhile
you
read
it
and
not
only
that
but
told
everybody
else
about
it
caroline
expression
changed
she
was
suddenly
sulky
her
face
was
like
that
of
a
spoilt
child
well
maggie
cardinal
if
you
call
that
being
a
friend
to
say
that
i
would
ever
do
such
a
thing
you
know
you
did
said
maggie
quietly
read
your
letters
as
though
i
want
to
why
should
i
as
though
i
had
something
more
interesting
to
do
no
thank
you
of
course
you
have
been
getting
yourself
into
a
mess
every
one
knows
that
why
i
came
here
to
show
you
that
i
was
a
real
friend
and
mind
what
people
said
about
you
when
they
were
all
talking
about
you
last
night
and
saying
the
most
dreadful
things
i
defended
you
and
said
it
was
really
your
fault
you
could
have
told
what
a
rotten
sort
of
a
man
martin
warlock
was
that
enough
said
maggie
i
do
want
your
defence
thank
you
you
mean
and
deceitful
and
untrue
you
never
have
been
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
do
want
ever
to
see
you
again
caroline
smith
was
horrified
well
upon
my
word
is
that
gratitude
here
am
i
the
only
person
in
this
whole
place
would
take
any
trouble
with
you
when
the
others
all
said
that
you
were
plain
and
stupid
and
had
anything
to
say
for
yourself
i
stuck
to
you
i
did
all
i
could
wasting
all
my
time
going
to
the
dressmaker
with
you
and
trying
to
make
you
look
like
something
human
and
this
is
the
way
you
repay
me
well
there
a
lesson
for
me
many
the
time
mother
said
to
me
you
just
ruin
yourself
with
that
kind
heart
of
yours
laying
yourself
out
for
others
when
you
ought
to
be
seeing
after
yourself
you
got
too
big
a
heart
for
this
world
does
it
just
show
one
and
to
end
it
all
with
accusing
me
of
reading
your
letters
if
you
choose
to
sit
in
the
park
after
dark
with
a
man
who
everybody
knows
either
you
going
to
leave
this
room
or
i
am
said
maggie
thank
you
said
caroline
tossing
her
head
i
have
the
slightest
desire
to
stay
i
assure
you
only
you
be
sorry
for
this
maggie
cardinal
you
will
indeed
with
a
swish
of
the
skirts
and
a
violent
banging
of
the
door
she
was
gone
the
only
friend
i
had
thought
maggie
the
next
development
was
an
announcement
from
aunt
anne
that
she
would
like
maggie
to
accompany
her
to
a
meeting
at
miss
avies
aunt
anne
did
not
explain
what
kind
of
a
meeting
it
would
be
and
maggie
asked
no
questions
she
simply
replied
that
she
would
go
she
had
indeed
by
this
time
a
very
considerable
curiosity
of
her
own
as
to
what
every
one
thought
was
going
to
happen
in
ten
days
time
perhaps
this
meeting
would
enlighten
her
it
did
on
arriving
at
miss
avies
gaunt
and
menacing
apartment
she
found
herself
in
the
very
stronghold
of
the
inside
saints
it
was
a
strange
affair
and
maggie
was
never
to
see
anything
quite
like
it
again
in
the
first
place
miss
avies
room
was
not
exactly
the
place
in
which
you
would
have
expected
to
discover
a
meeting
of
this
kind
she
lived
over
a
in
john
street
adelphi
her
was
with
little
windows
the
place
was
let
furnished
and
the
green
and
red
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
the
brass
clock
and
the
bright
yellow
wallpaper
were
properties
of
the
landlord
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
miss
avies
although
she
lived
there
for
a
number
of
years
had
contributed
nothing
it
had
all
the
desolate
forlornness
of
a
habitation
in
which
no
human
being
has
dwelt
for
a
very
long
time
there
was
dust
on
the
mantelpiece
a
melancholy
sputtering
of
coal
choked
with
cinders
and
gasping
for
breath
in
the
fireplace
stuffy
hot
clamminess
beating
about
the
unopened
windows
along
the
breadth
of
the
faded
brown
carpet
some
fifty
chairs
were
pressed
tightly
in
rows
together
and
in
front
of
the
window
facing
the
chairs
was
a
little
wooden
table
with
a
chair
beside
it
on
the
table
a
glass
of
water
and
a
bible
when
maggie
and
her
aunts
entered
the
chairs
were
almost
all
occupied
and
they
were
forced
to
sit
at
the
end
of
the
last
row
but
one
the
meeting
had
apparently
not
yet
begun
and
many
heads
were
turned
towards
them
as
they
took
their
places
maggie
fancied
that
the
glances
directed
at
herself
were
angry
and
severe
but
that
was
very
possibly
her
imagination
she
soon
recognised
people
known
to
her
miss
pyncheon
calm
and
placid
smith
caroline
mother
very
stout
hot
and
amy
warlock
proud
and
severe
and
miss
avies
herself
standing
like
a
general
surveying
his
forces
behind
the
table
the
room
was
draughty
and
close
and
had
a
confused
smell
of
and
geraniums
and
maggie
knew
that
soon
she
would
have
a
headache
she
fancied
that
already
the
atmosphere
was
influencing
the
meeting
from
where
she
sat
she
could
see
a
succession
of
side
faces
and
it
was
strange
what
a
hungry
appealing
look
these
pale
cheeks
and
staring
eyes
had
hungry
yes
that
what
they
all
were
she
thought
fantastically
for
a
moment
of
poor
magnus
treasure
hunters
and
she
seemed
to
see
the
whole
of
this
company
in
a
raft
drifting
in
not
a
sail
in
sight
and
the
last
ship
biscuit
gone
they
were
not
taken
altogether
a
very
fine
collection
old
maids
and
young
girls
many
of
them
apparently
of
the
servant
class
one
or
two
sitting
with
open
mouths
and
a
vacancy
of
expression
that
seemed
to
demand
a
conjurer
with
a
rabbit
and
a
hat
some
faces
were
of
the
true
fanatic
cast
lit
with
the
glow
of
an
expectancy
and
a
hope
that
no
rational
experience
had
ever
actually
justified
one
girl
whom
maggie
had
seen
with
aunt
anne
on
some
occasion
had
especially
this
prophetic
anticipation
in
the
whole
pose
of
her
body
as
she
bent
forward
a
little
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
chin
on
her
hands
gazing
with
wide
burning
eyes
at
miss
avies
this
girl
whom
maggie
was
never
to
see
again
hung
as
a
picture
in
the
rooms
of
her
mind
for
the
rest
of
her
life
the
youth
the
desperate
anxiety
as
of
one
who
throws
her
last
piece
upon
the
the
poverty
of
the
shabby
black
dress
the
real
physical
austerity
and
asceticism
of
the
white
cheeks
and
the
thin
arms
and
pale
hands
this
figure
remained
a
symbol
for
maggie
she
used
to
wonder
in
after
years
when
fortune
had
carried
her
far
enough
away
from
all
this
world
what
had
happened
to
that
girl
but
she
was
never
to
know
there
were
faces
too
like
miss
pyncheon
calm
contented
confident
old
women
who
had
found
in
their
religion
the
panacea
of
all
their
troubles
there
were
faces
like
smith
coarse
and
vulgar
out
for
any
sensation
that
might
come
along
and
ready
instantly
to
express
their
contempt
if
the
particular
trick
that
they
were
expecting
failed
to
come
off
other
faces
again
like
amy
warlock
grimly
set
upon
secret
thoughts
and
purposes
of
their
own
faces
trained
to
withstand
any
sudden
attack
on
the
emotions
but
eager
too
like
the
rest
for
some
revelation
that
was
to
answer
all
questions
and
satisfy
all
expectations
maggie
wondered
as
she
looked
about
her
how
she
could
have
raised
in
her
own
imagination
around
the
chapel
and
its
affairs
so
formidable
an
atmosphere
of
terror
and
tyrannic
discipline
here
gathered
together
were
a
few
women
tired
pale
many
of
them
uneducated
awaiting
like
children
the
opening
of
a
box
the
springing
into
flower
of
a
dry
husk
of
a
seed
the
raising
of
the
curtain
on
some
wonderful
scene
maggie
as
she
looked
at
them
knew
that
they
must
be
disappointed
and
her
heart
ached
for
them
all
yes
even
for
amy
warlock
her
declared
enemy
she
lost
as
she
sat
there
for
the
moment
all
sense
of
her
own
personal
history
she
only
saw
them
all
tired
and
hungry
and
expectant
perhaps
after
all
there
was
something
behind
it
all
something
for
which
they
had
a
right
to
be
searching
even
of
that
she
had
not
sure
knowledge
but
the
pathos
and
also
the
bravery
of
their
search
touched
and
moved
her
she
was
beginning
to
understand
something
of
the
beauty
that
hovered
like
a
bird
always
just
out
of
sight
about
the
ugly
walls
of
the
chapel
whatever
they
want
poor
dears
she
thought
i
do
hope
they
get
it
miss
avies
opened
the
meeting
with
an
extempore
prayer
then
they
all
stood
up
and
sang
a
hymn
and
their
quavering
voices
were
thin
and
sharp
and
strained
in
the
stuffy
room
the
hymn
like
all
the
other
chapel
hymns
that
maggie
had
heard
had
to
do
with
the
blood
of
the
lamb
the
sacrifice
of
blood
the
blood
that
heals
there
was
also
a
refrain
and
when
thou
comest
lord
we
pray
that
thou
wilt
spare
thy
sword
or
on
that
grim
and
ghastly
day
who
will
escape
the
lord
who
will
escape
the
lord
there
were
many
verses
to
this
hymn
and
it
had
a
long
and
lugubrious
tune
so
that
maggie
thought
that
it
would
never
end
but
as
it
proceeded
the
words
worked
their
effect
on
the
congregation
and
at
the
last
there
was
much
emotion
and
several
women
were
crying
then
they
all
sat
down
again
and
the
meeting
developed
a
very
side
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
as
to
dates
places
appointments
and
maggie
was
amused
to
discover
that
in
this
part
of
the
proceedings
smith
had
a
great
deal
to
say
and
took
a
very
leading
place
the
gathering
became
like
any
other
assemblage
of
ladies
for
some
charitable
or
social
purpose
and
there
were
the
usual
disputes
and
signs
of
temper
and
wounded
pride
in
all
those
matters
miss
avies
was
a
most
admirable
and
unflinching
chairman
then
at
last
the
real
moment
came
miss
avies
got
up
to
speak
she
stood
there
scornful
superior
and
yet
with
some
almost
cynical
appeal
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
said
to
them
you
poor
fools
no
one
knows
better
than
i
the
folly
of
your
being
here
no
one
knows
better
than
i
how
far
you
will
all
of
you
be
from
realising
any
of
your
dreams
tricked
the
lot
of
you
and
yet
and
yet
go
on
believing
expecting
hoping
pray
pray
that
i
may
be
wrong
and
you
may
be
right
what
she
actually
said
was
as
follows
this
will
be
our
last
meeting
before
the
end
of
the
year
what
will
come
to
all
of
us
before
we
all
meet
again
no
one
can
say
but
this
we
all
know
that
we
have
most
of
us
been
living
now
for
many
years
in
expectation
we
have
been
taught
by
the
goodness
of
god
to
believe
that
we
must
be
ready
at
any
moment
to
obey
his
call
and
that
call
may
come
in
the
middle
of
our
work
of
our
prayers
of
our
love
for
others
of
our
pursuit
of
our
own
ambitions
and
that
whenever
it
does
come
we
must
be
ready
to
obey
it
we
have
been
told
by
our
great
and
good
master
who
has
been
set
over
us
for
our
guidance
by
god
himself
that
that
call
may
now
be
very
near
whatever
form
it
may
take
we
must
accept
it
give
up
all
we
have
and
follow
him
that
is
understood
by
all
of
us
i
will
not
say
more
now
this
is
not
the
time
for
any
more
directions
from
me
we
must
address
ourselves
each
one
of
us
to
god
himself
and
ask
him
to
prepare
us
so
that
we
may
be
as
he
would
have
us
on
the
day
of
his
coming
i
suggest
now
before
we
part
that
we
share
together
in
a
few
minutes
of
private
prayer
they
all
rose
and
maggie
before
she
knelt
down
caught
a
sudden
glimpse
of
the
pale
girl
whom
she
had
noticed
earlier
standing
for
a
moment
as
though
she
were
about
to
make
some
desperate
appeal
to
them
all
some
words
did
indeed
seem
to
come
from
her
lips
but
the
scraping
of
chairs
drowned
every
other
sound
nevertheless
that
figure
was
there
the
hands
stretched
out
the
very
soul
struggling
through
the
eyes
for
expression
the
body
tense
sacred
eloquent
like
the
body
of
some
young
prophetess
then
all
were
on
their
knees
and
maggie
too
her
face
in
her
hands
was
praying
it
was
perhaps
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
actively
consciously
of
her
own
volition
prayed
the
appeal
formed
itself
as
it
were
without
her
own
agency
god
if
there
is
a
god
give
me
martin
i
care
for
nothing
else
but
that
if
you
will
give
me
martin
for
my
own
always
ever
i
will
believe
in
you
i
will
worship
you
and
say
prayers
to
you
and
do
anything
you
tell
me
if
you
give
me
martin
oh
god
i
ought
to
have
him
he
is
mine
i
can
do
more
for
him
than
any
one
else
can
i
can
make
him
happy
and
good
i
know
i
can
god
give
him
to
me
and
i
will
be
your
slave
god
give
me
martin
god
give
me
martin
she
rose
as
it
were
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
from
great
darkness
and
breathlessness
and
exhaustion
for
a
moment
she
could
not
see
the
room
nor
any
detail
but
only
one
pale
face
after
another
like
a
pattern
on
a
wall
hiding
something
from
her
she
stood
bewildered
beside
her
aunts
not
hearing
the
strains
of
the
last
hymn
nor
the
quaver
of
aunt
anne
trembling
voice
beside
her
god
give
me
martin
was
her
last
challenge
in
the
strange
pale
silence
that
floated
around
her
then
suddenly
as
though
she
had
pushed
open
a
door
and
gone
through
she
was
back
in
the
world
again
a
flood
of
sound
was
about
her
ears
and
in
front
of
her
the
red
face
of
smith
her
mouth
wide
open
like
the
mouth
of
an
eager
fish
singing
about
the
blood
of
the
lamb
with
unctuous
satisfaction
chapter
x
the
prophet
the
year
had
four
more
days
of
life
it
crept
to
its
grave
through
a
web
and
tangle
of
fog
it
was
not
one
of
the
regular
yellow
devils
who
come
and
eat
up
london
first
this
part
and
then
that
then
disgorge
a
little
choking
it
all
up
only
to
snap
at
it
and
swallow
it
down
all
bewildered
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
this
was
a
cobweb
fog
spun
as
it
might
be
by
some
malignant
central
spider
hidden
darkly
in
his
lair
the
filmy
threads
twisted
and
twined
their
way
all
over
london
and
for
four
days
and
nights
the
town
was
a
city
of
ghosts
buildings
loomed
dimly
behind
their
masks
of
silver
tissue
streets
seemed
unsubstantial
pavements
had
no
foundation
streams
of
water
appeared
to
hang
glittering
in
men
and
horses
would
suddenly
plunge
into
grey
abysses
and
vanish
from
sight
would
ring
peals
high
up
in
air
and
there
would
be
it
seemed
no
steeple
there
for
them
to
ring
from
as
the
sun
behind
the
fog
rose
and
set
so
the
mist
would
catch
gold
and
red
and
purple
into
the
vapours
strange
gleams
of
brass
and
silver
as
though
behind
its
web
armies
flaunting
their
colours
were
marching
through
the
sky
down
on
the
very
earth
itself
horses
staggered
and
stumbled
on
the
thin
coating
of
greasy
mud
that
covered
everything
men
opened
their
doors
to
look
out
on
to
the
world
and
instantly
into
the
passages
there
floated
such
strange
forms
and
shadows
in
misty
shape
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
rooms
were
suddenly
invaded
by
a
flock
of
spirits
sometimes
for
half
an
hour
the
fog
lifted
and
bright
blue
sky
gleamed
like
a
miraculous
lake
suddenly
discovered
in
the
heart
of
the
boundless
waste
then
vanished
again
suddenly
with
a
whisk
of
the
immortal
broom
the
web
was
torn
the
spider
slain
the
world
clear
once
more
but
in
the
obscurity
and
dusk
had
seen
his
chance
and
vanished
warlock
long
before
this
had
lost
consciousness
of
external
sights
and
sounds
he
could
not
have
told
any
one
when
it
was
that
the
two
worlds
had
parted
company
for
many
many
years
he
had
been
conscious
of
both
existences
but
during
his
youth
and
they
had
seemed
to
mingle
and
go
along
together
he
had
believed
in
both
equally
and
had
been
a
citizen
of
both
then
gradually
as
time
passed
he
had
seemed
to
have
less
and
less
hold
upon
the
actual
physical
world
he
saw
it
suddenly
with
darkened
vision
his
wife
and
daughter
and
indeed
all
human
beings
except
in
so
far
as
they
were
souls
to
be
saved
for
the
lord
became
less
and
less
realities
only
martin
was
flesh
and
blood
to
be
loved
and
longed
for
and
feared
for
just
as
he
had
always
been
all
the
physical
properties
of
life
clothes
food
household
possessions
money
became
of
less
and
less
importance
to
him
had
amy
not
watched
over
him
he
would
have
been
many
days
without
any
food
at
all
and
one
day
he
come
into
the
at
clothed
in
a
towel
all
this
had
come
upon
him
with
vastly
increased
power
during
the
last
months
in
chapel
and
whenever
he
had
work
to
do
in
connection
with
the
chapel
he
was
and
practical
but
in
things
to
do
with
this
world
he
was
now
worse
than
a
child
he
was
conscious
of
this
increasing
difficulty
to
deal
with
both
worlds
it
was
because
one
world
the
world
of
god
was
opening
out
before
him
so
widely
and
with
so
varied
and
thrilling
a
beauty
that
there
was
less
and
less
time
to
be
spared
for
the
drab
realities
of
physical
things
all
his
life
he
had
been
preparing
and
then
suddenly
the
call
had
come
shortly
after
martin
return
he
had
known
in
chapel
one
evening
that
god
was
approaching
it
had
happened
that
that
day
owing
to
his
absorption
in
his
work
he
had
eaten
nothing
and
there
had
come
to
him
whilst
praying
to
the
congregation
a
sensation
of
faintness
so
strong
that
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
would
fall
from
his
seat
then
it
had
passed
to
give
way
to
a
strange
thrilling
sense
of
expectancy
it
was
as
though
a
servant
had
opened
the
door
and
had
announced
my
master
is
coming
sir
he
had
felt
indeed
as
though
he
had
been
lifted
up
in
the
sheet
of
paul
the
apostle
to
meet
his
god
there
had
been
the
most
wonderful
sense
of
elevation
a
clearing
of
light
a
gentler
freshness
in
the
air
a
sudden
sinking
to
remoteness
of
human
voices
and
mundane
sounds
from
that
moment
in
the
chapel
life
had
been
changed
for
him
he
never
seemed
to
come
down
again
from
that
mysterious
elevation
human
voices
sounded
far
away
from
him
he
could
be
urged
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
take
his
food
and
he
frequently
did
not
recognise
members
of
his
own
congregation
when
they
came
to
see
him
he
waited
now
waited
waited
for
this
visitation
that
was
approaching
him
he
could
have
no
doubts
of
it
then
one
night
he
woke
from
a
deep
sleep
he
was
conscious
that
his
room
was
filled
with
a
smoky
light
in
his
heart
was
such
an
ecstasy
that
he
would
have
thought
that
the
joy
would
kill
him
something
spoke
to
him
telling
him
to
prepare
that
he
had
been
chosen
and
that
further
signs
would
come
to
him
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
and
remained
there
in
a
trance
until
daylight
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
god
he
had
seen
his
light
he
had
been
chosen
as
his
servant
some
weeks
later
a
second
visitation
came
to
him
similar
to
the
first
but
telling
him
that
at
the
last
hour
of
the
present
year
god
would
come
in
his
own
person
to
save
the
world
and
that
he
must
make
this
known
to
a
few
chosen
spirits
that
they
might
prepare
the
whole
brotherhood
then
was
at
length
justified
they
alone
out
of
all
men
in
the
world
had
believed
in
the
second
coming
of
the
lord
and
so
god
had
chosen
them
he
had
no
doubt
at
all
about
his
visions
at
this
time
they
seemed
to
him
as
real
and
sure
as
the
daily
traffic
of
the
streets
and
the
monotonous
progress
of
the
clock
eagerly
with
the
confident
resolution
of
a
child
he
told
his
news
to
the
leaders
of
the
chapel
thurston
miss
avies
and
one
or
two
others
then
a
special
meeting
of
the
inside
saints
was
called
and
in
the
simplest
language
he
described
exactly
what
had
occurred
he
did
not
at
first
perceive
the
effect
that
his
news
had
then
dimly
through
the
mist
of
his
prayers
and
ecstasies
he
realised
that
his
message
had
created
confusion
there
was
in
the
first
place
the
question
as
to
whether
the
whole
congregation
should
be
told
he
found
that
he
could
not
decide
about
this
and
when
he
left
the
judgment
to
thurston
thurston
told
him
that
in
his
opinion
the
less
that
they
knew
about
it
the
better
it
was
then
that
the
first
suspicion
came
to
him
as
to
whether
some
of
the
saints
doubted
he
questioned
thurston
as
to
the
effect
of
this
message
upon
the
saints
thurston
explained
to
him
that
many
of
them
had
been
very
troubled
they
had
not
expected
it
to
come
so
soon
thurston
explained
that
they
were
after
all
only
poor
human
clay
like
the
rest
of
mankind
and
to
prepare
for
a
second
coming
in
general
something
that
might
descend
upon
the
world
say
in
a
hundred
years
time
was
very
different
from
a
judgment
that
might
be
expected
definitely
in
about
three
weeks
one
or
two
of
them
in
fact
had
left
the
chapel
others
begged
for
some
clearer
direction
give
it
them
a
bit
more
clearly
master
tell
a
few
facts
what
the
lord
god
looked
like
and
he
spoke
and
in
what
kind
of
way
he
was
coming
supposing
he
was
to
come
after
all
it
was
then
that
the
trouble
that
had
been
smouldering
for
so
long
between
thurston
and
the
master
burst
into
flame
for
half
an
hour
the
master
lost
his
temper
like
an
ordinary
human
being
thurston
said
very
little
but
listened
with
a
quiet
and
sarcastic
smile
then
he
went
away
warlock
was
left
in
a
torment
of
doubt
and
misery
that
night
he
was
in
his
room
until
the
dawn
on
his
knees
wrestling
with
god
he
accused
himself
because
during
these
latter
months
he
had
removed
himself
from
human
contact
with
his
congregation
he
had
been
so
intent
upon
god
that
he
had
forgotten
his
flock
now
he
hardly
knew
how
to
approach
them
the
thought
of
a
personal
interview
with
the
miss
cardinals
or
miss
pyncheon
or
smith
filled
him
with
a
strange
shy
terror
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
them
and
he
blamed
himself
bitterly
because
he
had
been
intent
upon
his
own
salvation
rather
than
theirs
thurston
words
sent
him
groping
back
through
the
details
of
the
visions
and
there
were
no
details
for
himself
there
had
been
enough
in
the
light
the
ecstasy
the
contact
but
these
others
who
had
not
themselves
felt
this
nor
seen
its
glory
demanded
more
he
began
then
in
an
agony
of
distress
to
question
himself
as
to
whether
he
had
not
dreamt
his
visions
he
wrestled
with
god
beseeching
him
to
come
again
and
give
him
a
clearer
message
night
after
night
passed
and
he
waited
for
some
further
vision
but
nothing
was
granted
him
then
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
himself
was
now
cursed
for
leaving
god
god
had
come
to
him
and
revealed
himself
to
him
in
unmistakable
signs
and
yet
he
was
doubting
him
and
demanding
further
help
as
the
weeks
passed
he
perceived
more
and
more
clearly
that
there
was
every
kind
of
division
and
trouble
in
the
chapel
many
members
left
and
wrote
to
him
telling
him
why
they
had
done
so
in
his
own
household
he
felt
that
amy
no
longer
gave
him
any
confidence
she
attended
to
him
more
carefully
than
before
watched
over
him
as
though
he
were
a
baby
but
made
no
allusion
to
the
services
or
the
chapel
or
any
meeting
he
seemed
as
the
weeks
passed
to
be
lonelier
and
lonelier
and
he
looked
upon
this
as
punishment
for
his
own
earlier
selfishness
he
was
pulled
then
two
ways
on
the
one
hand
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
only
hear
god
full
message
if
he
withdrew
further
and
further
from
the
world
on
the
other
he
felt
that
he
was
letting
his
followers
slip
away
from
him
now
at
the
very
moment
when
he
should
be
closest
to
them
advising
helping
encouraging
this
divided
impulse
was
a
torture
and
as
the
weeks
went
on
he
ate
less
and
less
and
slept
scarcely
at
all
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
past
in
delicate
health
owing
to
the
weakness
of
his
heart
and
now
he
began
to
look
strange
indeed
with
his
bright
gaunt
face
with
its
prominent
his
eyes
straining
to
see
beyond
his
actual
vision
his
flowing
white
beard
his
doctor
a
cheerful
commonplace
little
man
a
member
of
the
chapel
although
not
a
saint
tried
to
do
his
best
with
him
but
his
visits
only
led
to
scenes
of
irritation
and
warlock
obeyed
none
of
his
commands
after
a
visit
on
the
afternoon
of
christmas
eve
he
took
amy
aside
look
here
he
said
unless
you
keep
a
stricter
eye
on
your
father
than
you
have
been
doing
he
be
leaving
you
altogether
she
looked
up
at
him
with
that
odd
dark
impassivity
that
seemed
to
remove
her
so
deliberately
from
her
it
very
well
to
talk
like
that
she
said
but
how
is
any
one
to
have
any
control
over
him
he
listens
to
nothing
that
we
say
and
if
we
insist
he
in
a
frenzy
of
irritation
can
your
mother
do
nothing
the
doctor
asked
mother
amy
smiled
no
mother
can
do
nothing
well
said
the
doctor
any
sudden
shock
will
kill
him
i
warn
you
when
the
fog
came
down
upon
the
city
warlock
was
already
in
too
thick
a
fog
of
his
own
to
perceive
it
he
was
sure
now
of
nothing
it
seemed
as
though
all
the
spirits
of
the
other
world
now
were
taunting
him
but
he
felt
that
this
was
the
work
of
the
devil
who
wished
to
destroy
his
faith
before
the
great
day
arrived
he
thought
now
that
the
devil
was
closely
pursuing
him
and
he
seemed
to
hear
first
his
taunting
whisper
and
then
the
voice
of
god
encouraging
him
well
done
my
good
and
faithful
servant
he
had
lost
now
almost
all
consciousness
of
what
he
really
expected
to
happen
when
the
day
arrived
but
he
was
dimly
aware
that
if
nothing
happened
at
all
his
whole
influence
with
his
people
would
be
gone
nevertheless
this
did
not
trouble
him
very
greatly
the
congregation
of
the
chapel
seemed
now
dimly
remote
the
only
human
being
who
was
not
remote
was
martin
his
love
for
his
son
had
not
been
touched
by
his
other
struggles
it
had
been
even
intensified
but
the
love
had
grown
a
terror
ever
increasing
lest
martin
should
leave
him
he
seemed
to
hear
dimly
beyond
the
wall
of
the
mysterious
world
into
whose
regions
he
was
ever
more
deeply
passing
sentences
vague
without
human
agency
accusing
martin
of
sins
and
infidelities
and
riotous
living
sometimes
he
was
tempted
to
go
further
into
this
and
challenge
accusers
but
fear
held
him
back
martin
had
been
a
good
son
since
his
return
to
england
yes
he
had
and
he
had
forsaken
his
evil
ways
and
was
going
to
be
with
his
father
now
until
the
end
his
last
refuge
against
loneliness
every
one
else
had
left
him
or
was
leaving
him
but
martin
was
there
martin
had
deceived
him
martin
was
a
good
boy
a
good
boy
and
then
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
martin
hand
in
his
own
he
would
pass
off
into
his
world
of
strange
dreams
and
desperate
prayer
and
hours
of
waiting
listening
straining
for
a
voice
during
that
last
night
before
new
year
eve
an
hour
came
to
him
when
he
seemed
to
be
left
utterly
alone
exhausted
faint
dizzy
with
want
of
sleep
and
food
he
knelt
before
his
bed
his
room
seemed
to
be
filled
with
devils
taunting
him
tempting
him
bewildering
and
blinding
him
he
rose
suddenly
in
a
frenzy
striking
out
rushing
about
his
room
crying
then
at
last
exhausted
creeping
back
to
his
bed
falling
down
upon
it
and
sinking
into
a
long
dreamless
sleep
they
found
him
sleeping
when
they
came
to
call
him
and
they
left
him
he
did
not
wake
until
the
early
afternoon
his
brain
seemed
clear
and
his
body
so
weak
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
washed
and
put
on
some
clothes
the
room
was
dark
with
the
fog
lamps
in
the
street
below
glimmered
uncertainly
and
voices
and
the
traffic
of
the
street
were
muffled
he
opened
his
door
and
looking
out
heard
in
the
room
below
voice
raised
excitedly
slowly
he
went
down
to
meet
him
martin
also
had
reached
on
that
last
day
of
the
year
the
very
end
of
his
tether
during
the
last
ten
days
he
had
been
fighting
against
every
weakness
to
which
his
character
was
susceptible
with
the
new
year
he
felt
that
everything
would
be
well
he
could
draw
a
new
breath
then
find
work
somewhere
away
from
london
have
maggie
perhaps
with
him
and
drive
a
way
out
of
all
the
tangle
of
his
perplexities
but
even
then
he
did
not
dare
to
face
the
future
thoroughly
would
his
father
let
him
go
was
he
after
all
his
struggles
to
give
way
and
ruin
position
and
future
could
he
be
sure
if
he
look
her
away
with
him
that
then
he
would
keep
straight
and
that
his
old
temptations
of
women
and
drink
and
general
restlessness
would
be
conquered
perhaps
there
had
never
been
a
surer
proof
that
his
love
for
maggie
was
a
real
and
unselfish
love
than
his
hesitation
on
that
wretched
day
when
he
seemed
utterly
deserted
by
mankind
when
maggie
seemed
the
only
friend
he
had
in
the
world
everything
was
just
out
of
reach
and
some
perverse
destiny
prevented
him
from
realising
any
desire
that
had
a
spark
of
honesty
and
decency
in
it
it
was
not
wonderful
that
in
the
midst
of
his
loneliness
and
unhappiness
he
should
have
been
tempted
back
to
the
old
paths
again
men
women
places
that
for
more
than
three
months
now
he
had
been
struggling
to
abandon
all
that
day
he
struggled
with
temptation
he
had
not
seen
maggie
for
a
week
and
during
the
last
three
days
he
had
not
heard
from
her
the
adventurous
jane
having
defied
the
aunts
and
left
at
luncheon
he
asked
about
his
father
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
days
father
had
a
very
bad
night
he
asleep
now
there
something
on
is
there
he
asked
there
a
service
amy
answered
shortly
father
ought
to
go
he
went
on
i
suppose
your
friend
thurston
can
manage
amy
looked
at
him
father
got
to
go
it
very
important
oh
of
course
if
you
want
to
kill
father
with
all
your
beastly
services
he
broke
in
furiously
it
wo
be
amy
began
and
then
as
though
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
continue
got
up
and
left
the
room
mother
he
said
why
on
earth
do
you
do
something
i
dear
she
looked
at
him
placidly
in
what
way
they
killing
father
between
them
with
all
these
services
and
the
rest
of
the
nonsense
your
father
does
listen
to
anything
i
say
dear
he
ought
to
go
away
for
a
long
rest
well
dear
perhaps
he
will
soon
you
know
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
chapel
that
was
settled
years
ago
i
would
interfere
for
a
great
deal
martin
turned
fiercely
upon
her
saying
mother
do
you
care
care
dear
yes
about
father
his
living
and
getting
well
again
and
being
happy
as
he
used
to
be
what
happened
to
this
place
she
looked
at
him
in
the
strangest
way
he
suddenly
felt
that
never
seen
her
before
there
are
a
number
of
things
martin
that
you
do
understand
a
number
of
things
you
are
away
from
us
for
years
you
come
back
to
us
and
expect
things
to
be
the
same
you
and
amy
he
said
both
of
you
have
kept
me
out
of
everything
since
i
came
back
i
believe
you
both
hate
me
she
got
up
slowly
from
her
seat
slowly
put
her
spectacles
away
in
their
case
rubbed
her
fat
little
hands
together
then
suddenly
licked
inquisitively
one
finger
as
an
animal
might
do
she
spoke
to
him
over
her
shoulder
as
she
went
to
the
door
oh
no
martin
you
speak
too
strongly
left
then
to
his
own
devices
he
at
last
wandered
out
into
the
foggy
streets
after
a
while
he
found
himself
outside
a
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
went
in
he
asked
the
stout
rubicund
young
woman
behind
the
counter
for
a
whisky
she
gave
him
one
he
drank
that
and
then
another
afterwards
he
had
several
more
leaning
over
the
bar
speaking
to
no
one
seeing
no
one
hearing
nothing
and
scarcely
tasting
the
drink
when
he
came
out
into
the
street
again
he
knew
that
he
was
half
drunk
not
so
drunk
that
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
oh
dear
no
he
could
drink
any
amount
without
feeling
it
nevertheless
he
had
drunk
so
little
during
these
last
weeks
that
even
a
drop
how
foggy
the
streets
were
made
it
difficult
to
find
your
way
home
but
he
was
all
right
he
could
walk
straight
he
could
put
his
into
the
door
at
one
try
he
was
all
right
he
was
at
home
again
he
did
stop
to
hang
up
his
hat
and
coat
but
went
straight
into
the
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
he
saw
that
the
meal
was
still
on
the
table
just
as
they
left
it
amy
was
there
too
he
saw
her
move
back
when
he
came
in
as
though
she
were
afraid
to
touch
him
you
drunk
she
said
i
not
you
a
liar
amy
you
always
been
a
liar
all
your
life
she
tried
to
pass
him
but
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
door
no
you
do
he
said
we
got
to
have
this
out
what
have
you
been
spreading
scandal
about
me
and
maggie
cardinal
for
let
me
go
she
said
again
tell
me
that
first
you
always
tried
to
do
me
harm
why
because
i
hate
the
sight
of
you
she
answered
quickly
as
asked
me
you
shall
have
a
truthful
answer
you
never
been
anything
but
a
disgrace
to
us
ever
since
you
were
a
little
boy
you
disgraced
us
at
home
and
then
abroad
now
you
come
back
to
disgrace
us
here
again
that
a
lie
he
repeated
i
not
disgraced
anybody
well
it
wo
be
very
long
before
you
finish
ruining
that
wretched
girl
the
best
you
can
do
now
is
to
marry
her
i
ca
do
that
he
said
i
married
already
she
did
not
answer
that
hut
stared
at
him
with
amazement
but
never
mind
that
he
went
on
what
if
i
am
a
bad
lot
i
know
what
a
bad
lot
is
exactly
but
if
you
mean
that
i
lived
with
women
and
been
drunk
and
lost
jobs
because
i
did
do
the
work
and
been
generally
on
the
loose
it
true
of
course
but
i
meant
to
live
decently
when
i
came
home
yes
i
did
you
can
sneer
as
much
as
you
like
why
did
you
help
me
you
my
sister
are
you
and
now
i
do
care
what
i
do
you
all
given
me
up
well
give
me
up
and
i
just
go
to
bits
as
fast
as
i
can
go
if
you
do
want
me
there
are
others
who
do
or
at
any
rate
the
bit
of
money
i
got
kept
me
from
the
only
decent
girl
i
ever
known
the
one
i
could
have
been
straight
with
straight
with
amy
broke
in
how
were
you
going
to
be
straight
if
you
married
already
he
would
have
answered
her
but
a
sound
behind
him
made
him
turn
he
wheeled
round
and
saw
his
father
standing
almost
up
against
him
he
had
only
time
for
a
horrified
vision
of
the
ghostlike
figure
the
staring
eyes
the
open
mouth
the
white
cheeks
the
old
man
caught
his
coat
martin
what
was
that
what
did
you
say
no
no
i
ca
bear
that
now
i
ca
i
ca
he
turned
and
made
as
though
he
would
run
up
the
stairs
catching
about
him
like
a
child
the
shabby
old
that
he
was
wearing
at
the
first
step
he
stumbled
clutching
the
bannister
to
save
himself
martin
rushed
to
him
putting
his
arms
round
him
holding
him
close
to
him
it
all
right
father
it
not
true
what
you
heard
all
right
his
father
turned
putting
his
arms
round
his
neck
martin
half
helped
half
carried
him
up
to
his
bedroom
he
laid
him
on
his
bed
and
then
holding
his
hand
sat
by
his
side
all
through
the
long
dim
afternoon
about
five
warlock
suddenly
revived
sat
up
arid
with
the
assistance
of
martin
dressed
properly
had
some
tea
and
went
down
to
his
study
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
then
suddenly
looking
up
at
his
son
he
said
did
you
and
amy
have
a
quarrel
this
afternoon
no
father
said
martin
that
right
i
thought
i
thought
i
do
know
my
confused
you
been
a
good
boy
martin
have
you
there
no
need
for
me
to
worry
is
there
none
father
martin
said
after
a
while
martin
said
father
do
go
to
chapel
warlock
smiled
i
must
go
that
all
right
nothing
to
worry
about
for
some
while
he
sat
there
martin
hand
in
his
martin
did
not
know
whether
he
were
asleep
or
not
at
about
ten
he
ate
and
drank
at
eleven
he
started
with
amy
and
thurston
for
the
chapel
chapter
xi
the
chariot
of
fire
when
jane
scolded
by
aunt
anne
for
an
untidy
appearance
gave
notice
and
at
once
departed
maggie
felt
as
though
the
ground
was
giving
way
under
her
feet
a
week
until
the
new
year
and
no
opportunity
of
hearing
from
martin
during
that
time
then
she
laughed
at
herself
you
losing
your
sense
of
proportion
my
dear
over
this
laugh
at
yourself
what
a
week
she
did
laugh
at
herself
but
she
had
not
very
much
to
base
her
laughter
upon
martin
last
letters
had
been
short
and
very
uneasy
she
had
already
in
a
surprising
fashion
for
one
so
young
acquired
a
very
wise
and
just
estimate
of
martin
character
he
only
a
boy
she
used
to
say
to
herself
and
feel
his
elder
by
at
least
twenty
years
nevertheless
the
thought
of
his
struggling
on
there
alone
was
not
a
happy
one
she
longed
even
though
she
might
not
advise
him
to
comfort
him
she
was
beginning
to
realise
something
of
her
own
power
over
him
and
to
see
too
the
strange
mixture
of
superstition
and
and
that
overwhelmed
him
when
she
was
not
with
him
she
had
indeed
her
own
need
of
struggle
against
superstition
her
aunts
continued
to
treat
her
with
a
quiet
distant
severity
aunt
elizabeth
she
fancied
would
like
to
have
been
kind
to
her
but
she
was
entirely
under
the
influence
of
her
sister
and
there
too
maggie
was
generous
enough
to
see
that
aunt
anne
behaved
as
she
did
rather
from
a
stern
sense
of
duty
than
any
real
unkindness
aunt
anne
could
not
feel
unkindly
she
was
too
far
removed
from
human
temper
and
discontent
and
weakness
nevertheless
she
had
been
deeply
shocked
at
the
revelation
of
maggie
bad
behaviour
and
it
was
a
shock
from
which
in
all
probability
she
would
never
recover
we
never
be
friends
again
maggie
thought
watching
her
austere
composure
from
the
other
side
of
the
she
was
sad
at
the
thought
of
that
remembering
moments
that
first
visit
to
dreot
the
departure
in
the
cab
the
night
when
she
had
sat
at
her
aunt
bedside
that
had
given
glimpses
of
the
kind
human
creature
aunt
anne
might
have
been
had
she
never
heard
of
the
inside
saints
maggie
during
these
last
days
did
everything
that
her
aunts
told
her
she
was
as
good
and
docile
as
she
could
be
but
oh
there
were
some
dreary
hours
as
she
sat
alone
in
that
stuffy
trying
to
sew
her
heart
aching
with
loneliness
her
needle
always
doing
the
wrong
thing
the
clock
heavily
ticking
thomas
watching
her
from
the
mat
in
front
of
the
fire
and
the
family
group
sneering
at
her
from
the
it
was
during
these
hours
that
superstitious
terrors
gained
upon
her
could
it
be
possible
that
all
those
women
whom
she
had
seen
gathered
together
in
miss
avies
room
really
expected
god
to
come
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
on
the
last
night
of
the
year
it
was
like
some
old
story
of
ghosts
and
witches
that
her
nurse
used
to
tell
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
at
dreot
and
yet
in
that
dark
dreary
room
almost
anything
seemed
possible
after
all
if
there
was
a
god
why
should
he
not
one
day
suddenly
appear
and
if
he
wished
to
spare
certain
of
his
servants
why
should
he
not
prepare
them
first
before
he
came
there
were
things
just
as
strange
in
the
old
and
new
testament
but
if
he
did
come
what
would
his
coming
be
like
would
every
one
be
burnt
to
death
or
would
they
all
be
summoned
before
some
judgment
and
punished
for
the
wicked
things
they
had
done
would
her
father
perhaps
return
and
give
evidence
against
her
and
poor
uncle
mathew
how
would
he
fare
with
all
his
weaknesses
her
efforts
at
laughing
at
herself
rescued
her
from
some
of
the
more
incredible
of
these
pictures
nevertheless
the
uncertainty
remained
and
only
increased
her
loneliness
had
martin
been
there
in
five
minutes
they
would
together
have
chased
all
these
ghosts
away
but
he
was
not
there
and
at
the
thought
of
him
she
would
have
to
set
her
mouth
very
firmly
indeed
to
prevent
her
lips
from
trembling
she
took
out
her
ring
and
kissed
it
and
looked
at
the
already
tattered
copy
of
the
programme
of
the
play
to
which
they
had
been
and
recalled
every
minute
of
their
walks
together
christmas
day
was
a
very
miserable
affair
there
were
no
presents
and
no
festivities
they
went
to
chapel
and
thurston
preached
the
sermon
maggie
did
however
receive
one
letter
it
was
from
uncle
mathew
he
wrote
to
her
from
some
town
in
the
north
he
did
seem
very
happy
and
asked
her
whether
she
could
possibly
lend
him
five
pounds
alluding
with
a
characteristic
vagueness
to
business
plans
of
the
first
importance
that
were
likely
to
mature
very
shortly
she
told
aunt
anne
that
she
wanted
five
pounds
of
her
money
but
she
did
not
say
for
what
she
needed
them
aunt
anne
gave
her
the
money
at
once
without
a
word
as
though
she
said
we
have
given
up
all
control
of
you
except
to
see
that
you
behave
decently
whilst
you
are
still
with
us
when
the
fog
arrived
it
seemed
to
penetrate
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
house
the
daily
afternoon
walk
that
maggie
took
with
aunt
elizabeth
was
cancelled
because
of
the
difficulty
of
finding
one
way
from
street
to
street
and
because
some
rude
man
might
steal
money
in
the
darkness
and
maggie
was
not
sorry
those
walks
had
not
been
amusing
aunt
elizabeth
having
nothing
to
say
and
being
fully
occupied
with
keeping
an
eye
on
maggie
her
idea
apparently
being
that
the
girl
would
suddenly
dash
off
to
freedom
and
wickedness
and
be
lost
for
ever
maggie
had
no
such
intention
and
developed
during
these
weeks
a
queer
motherly
affection
for
both
the
aunts
so
lost
they
were
and
helpless
and
ignorant
of
the
world
my
dear
said
maggie
to
herself
you
a
bit
of
a
fool
as
far
as
goes
but
you
nothing
to
what
they
are
poor
dears
she
tried
to
improve
herself
in
every
way
for
their
benefit
but
her
memory
was
no
better
she
forgot
all
the
things
that
were
in
their
eyes
the
most
important
closing
doors
punctuality
for
meals
neat
stitches
careful
putting
away
of
books
and
clothes
once
during
a
walk
she
said
to
aunt
elizabeth
i
am
trying
aunt
elizabeth
do
you
think
aunt
anne
sees
any
improvement
and
all
aunt
elizabeth
said
was
it
was
a
great
shock
to
her
what
you
did
maggie
a
great
shock
indeed
when
the
last
day
of
the
year
arrived
maggie
was
surprised
at
the
strange
excitement
that
she
felt
it
was
excitement
not
only
because
of
the
dim
mysterious
events
that
the
evening
promised
but
also
because
she
was
sure
that
this
day
would
settle
the
loneliness
of
herself
and
martin
after
this
they
would
know
where
they
stood
and
what
they
must
do
old
warlock
loomed
in
front
of
her
as
the
very
arbiter
of
her
destiny
on
his
action
everything
turned
oh
if
only
after
this
he
were
well
enough
for
martin
to
be
happy
and
at
ease
about
him
she
was
tempted
to
hate
him
as
she
thought
of
all
the
trouble
that
he
had
made
for
her
then
her
mind
went
back
to
that
first
day
long
ago
when
he
had
spoken
to
her
so
kindly
and
bidden
her
come
and
see
him
as
often
as
she
could
how
little
she
had
known
then
what
the
future
held
for
her
and
now
around
his
tall
mysterious
figure
not
only
her
own
fate
but
that
of
every
one
else
seemed
to
hang
her
aunts
amy
miss
pyncheon
miss
avies
thurston
that
strange
girl
at
the
meeting
with
them
all
his
destiny
was
involved
and
they
with
his
as
the
day
advanced
and
the
silver
fog
blew
in
little
gusts
about
the
house
making
now
this
corner
now
that
obscure
drifting
so
that
suddenly
when
the
door
opened
the
whole
passage
seemed
full
of
smoke
clearing
for
a
moment
in
the
street
below
showing
and
pavements
and
windows
and
then
blowing
down
again
and
once
more
hiding
the
world
she
felt
in
spite
of
herself
that
she
was
playing
a
part
in
some
malignant
dream
it
ca
be
like
this
really
she
told
herself
if
i
were
to
go
to
tea
now
with
mark
and
sit
in
her
pretty
and
talk
to
that
clergyman
i
would
believe
a
word
of
it
and
yet
it
was
true
enough
her
share
in
it
as
the
afternoon
advanced
her
sensations
were
very
similar
to
those
that
she
had
had
when
about
to
visit
the
dreot
dentist
a
fearsome
man
with
red
hair
and
hands
like
a
dog
paws
she
saw
him
now
standing
over
her
as
she
sat
trembling
in
the
chair
a
miserable
little
figure
in
a
short
untidy
frock
she
used
to
repeat
to
herself
then
what
uncle
mathew
had
once
told
her
this
time
next
year
you
have
forgotten
all
about
this
but
when
it
was
a
question
of
facing
the
immensities
of
the
last
day
that
consolation
was
strangely
inapt
it
was
dusk
very
early
and
she
longed
for
martha
to
bring
the
lamp
at
last
it
came
and
tea
and
aunt
elizabeth
aunt
anne
had
not
appeared
all
day
then
long
dreary
hours
followed
until
supper
and
after
that
hours
again
until
ten
she
had
not
been
certain
all
this
time
whether
the
aunts
meant
to
take
her
to
the
service
with
them
she
had
supposed
that
her
introduction
to
the
meeting
at
miss
avies
meant
that
they
intended
to
include
her
in
this
too
but
now
as
the
evening
advanced
in
a
fit
of
nervous
terror
she
prayed
within
herself
that
they
would
not
take
her
if
the
end
of
the
world
were
coming
she
would
like
to
meet
it
in
her
bed
to
go
out
into
those
streets
and
that
ugly
unfriendly
chapel
was
a
horrible
thing
to
do
if
this
were
to
be
the
end
of
the
world
how
she
did
wish
that
she
might
have
been
allowed
to
know
nothing
about
it
and
those
others
miss
pyncheon
and
the
rest
who
devoutly
believed
in
the
event
how
were
they
passing
these
last
hours
oh
it
is
true
it
ca
be
true
she
said
to
herself
it
a
shame
to
frighten
them
so
by
eleven
the
excitement
of
the
day
had
wearied
her
so
that
she
fell
fast
asleep
in
the
beside
the
fire
she
woke
to
find
aunt
anne
standing
over
her
it
a
quarter
past
eleven
it
time
to
put
on
your
things
she
said
so
she
was
to
go
she
rose
and
in
spite
of
herself
her
limbs
were
trembling
and
her
teeth
chattered
to
her
surprise
aunt
anne
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
maggie
she
said
if
i
been
harsh
to
you
during
these
weeks
sorry
i
done
what
i
thought
my
duty
but
i
would
wish
on
this
night
that
we
should
have
any
unkindness
in
our
hearts
towards
one
another
oh
that
all
right
maggie
said
awkwardly
she
went
up
to
put
on
her
things
then
the
three
of
them
went
out
into
the
dark
foggy
street
together
because
it
was
new
year
eve
there
were
many
people
about
voices
laughing
and
shouting
through
the
mist
and
then
some
one
running
with
a
flaring
light
then
some
men
walking
singing
in
chorus
the
aunts
said
nothing
as
they
went
maggie
thoughts
were
given
now
to
wondering
whether
martin
would
be
there
she
tied
her
mind
to
that
but
behind
it
was
the
irritating
knowledge
that
her
teeth
were
chattering
and
her
knees
trembling
and
that
she
did
not
maintain
her
courage
as
a
cardinal
should
as
they
entered
the
chapel
the
hoarse
ugly
clock
over
the
door
grunted
out
eleven
the
chapel
seemed
on
maggie
entering
it
to
be
half
in
darkness
there
was
a
thin
splutter
of
gas
over
the
at
the
far
end
and
some
more
light
by
the
door
but
the
centre
of
the
building
was
a
shadowy
pool
only
a
few
were
present
gathered
together
in
the
middle
seats
below
the
desk
perhaps
in
all
a
hundred
persons
of
these
were
women
the
aunts
and
maggie
went
into
their
accustomed
seat
some
six
rows
from
the
front
when
maggie
rose
from
her
knees
and
looked
about
her
she
recognised
at
once
that
only
the
inside
saints
were
here
amongst
the
men
she
recognised
smith
caroline
father
two
old
men
brothers
who
had
followed
warlock
from
their
youth
and
a
young
pale
man
who
had
once
been
to
tea
with
her
aunts
martin
she
saw
at
once
was
not
there
for
some
time
perhaps
for
ten
minutes
they
all
sat
in
silence
and
only
the
gruff
comment
of
the
clock
sounded
in
the
building
then
the
lights
went
up
with
a
flare
and
thurston
followed
by
warlock
entered
it
was
at
that
moment
that
maggie
had
a
revelation
the
faces
around
her
seemed
to
be
suddenly
gathered
in
front
of
her
and
it
was
with
a
start
of
surprise
that
she
suddenly
realised
oh
but
they
do
believe
in
this
any
more
than
i
do
the
faces
around
her
were
agitated
with
odd
humble
beseeching
looks
as
though
they
were
helpless
utterly
and
were
hoping
that
some
one
would
suddenly
come
and
lead
them
somewhere
that
they
might
be
comfortable
again
and
at
ease
there
was
not
as
there
had
been
on
other
occasions
and
especially
during
that
service
that
crashaw
had
conducted
any
sign
of
religious
and
mystical
excitement
the
people
seemed
huddled
together
in
the
cold
and
draughty
place
against
their
will
and
the
very
fact
that
the
chapel
was
only
half
full
chilled
the
blood
no
drama
of
exultation
here
no
band
of
god
servants
gloriously
preparing
to
meet
him
only
the
frightened
gaze
of
a
little
gathering
of
servant
girls
and
old
maids
that
was
first
impression
then
when
the
service
began
when
the
first
hymn
had
been
sung
and
thurston
had
stumbled
into
his
extempore
prayer
maggie
found
herself
caught
into
a
strange
companionship
with
the
people
around
her
not
now
ecstasy
nor
the
excitement
of
religious
fanaticism
nor
the
superstitious
preparation
for
some
awful
events
none
of
these
emotions
now
lifted
her
into
some
strained
unnatural
sphere
no
nothing
but
a
strange
sympathy
and
kindness
and
understanding
that
she
had
never
known
in
all
her
life
before
she
felt
the
hunger
the
passionate
appeal
oh
god
come
prove
thyself
we
have
waited
so
long
we
have
resisted
unbelievers
we
have
fought
our
own
doubts
and
betrayals
give
us
now
a
sign
something
by
which
we
may
know
thee
and
with
that
appeal
the
conviction
in
the
hearts
of
almost
all
present
that
nothing
would
happen
that
god
would
give
no
sign
that
the
age
of
miracles
was
past
oh
why
did
he
want
to
be
so
definite
she
thought
why
could
he
have
left
them
as
they
were
without
forcing
them
to
this
they
were
sitting
down
now
and
thurston
with
his
cheap
sense
of
the
dramatic
and
false
emphasis
was
reading
from
the
new
testament
maggie
looked
to
where
warlock
was
a
little
to
the
right
of
thurston
in
his
black
gown
his
head
a
little
lowered
his
hands
on
his
lap
when
she
saw
him
she
was
touched
to
the
very
heart
why
he
had
aged
in
the
last
month
a
hundred
years
he
looked
sitting
there
so
frail
and
helpless
that
it
seemed
wonderful
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
get
there
at
all
his
hair
seemed
to
have
an
added
intensity
of
whiteness
and
his
beard
lay
against
the
black
cloth
of
his
gown
with
a
contrast
so
sharp
that
it
was
unreal
maggie
fancied
as
she
watched
him
that
he
was
bewildered
and
scarcely
knew
where
he
was
once
he
looked
up
and
round
about
him
he
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
then
let
it
fall
as
though
he
had
no
longer
any
control
over
it
she
was
now
so
touched
by
the
pathos
of
his
helplessness
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
longed
to
go
to
him
and
comfort
him
time
stole
on
and
it
was
now
ten
minutes
to
twelve
they
sang
another
hymn
but
the
voices
were
very
weak
and
feeble
and
the
words
quivered
round
the
building
in
a
ghostly
whisper
then
thurston
came
to
the
master
and
gave
him
his
arm
and
led
him
to
the
the
old
man
seemed
for
a
moment
as
though
he
would
fall
then
holding
to
the
front
of
the
desk
he
spoke
in
a
very
weak
and
faltering
voice
maggie
could
not
catch
many
of
his
words
my
children
only
a
little
time
our
preparation
now
is
finished
god
has
promised
not
the
least
of
these
his
little
ones
shall
perish
let
us
not
fear
but
be
ready
to
meet
him
as
our
friend
our
friend
god
our
father
then
in
a
stronger
voice
now
during
these
last
minutes
let
us
kneel
in
silent
prayer
they
all
knelt
down
maggie
had
no
thoughts
no
desire
except
that
the
time
might
pass
she
seemed
to
kneel
there
asleep
waiting
for
the
moment
when
some
one
should
tell
her
that
the
time
had
gone
and
she
was
safe
the
moments
dragged
eternally
a
thrilling
suspense
like
a
flood
of
water
pouring
into
an
empty
space
had
filled
the
chapel
no
one
moved
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
the
silence
there
struck
the
first
note
of
the
clock
tolling
the
hour
with
maggie
it
was
as
though
that
sound
liberated
her
from
the
spell
that
had
been
upon
her
she
looked
up
she
saw
the
master
standing
his
hands
stretched
out
his
face
splendid
with
glory
and
happiness
he
looked
beyond
them
all
beyond
the
chapel
beyond
the
world
he
gave
one
cry
my
god
thou
art
come
some
other
words
followed
but
were
caught
up
and
muffled
he
fell
forward
collapsing
in
a
heap
against
the
desk
his
head
struck
the
wood
and
then
he
lay
there
perfectly
still
maggie
could
only
dimly
gather
what
happened
after
the
sound
of
that
fall
there
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
long
and
terrible
silence
during
which
the
clock
continued
remorselessly
to
strike
the
chapel
appeared
to
be
a
place
of
shadows
as
though
the
gas
had
suddenly
died
to
dim
haloes
she
was
conscious
that
people
moved
about
her
that
aunt
anne
had
left
them
and
that
aunt
elizabeth
was
saying
to
her
again
and
again
how
terrible
how
terrible
how
terrible
then
as
though
it
were
some
other
person
maggie
found
herself
very
calmly
speaking
to
aunt
elizabeth
are
we
to
wait
for
aunt
anne
she
whispered
anne
said
we
were
to
go
home
then
let
go
whispered
maggie
they
went
to
the
door
pushing
it
seemed
through
shadows
who
whispered
and
forms
that
vanished
as
soon
as
one
looked
at
them
out
in
the
open
air
maggie
was
aware
that
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
but
a
determined
idea
that
she
must
get
aunt
elizabeth
home
at
once
drove
her
like
a
goad
very
strange
it
was
out
here
the
air
ringing
with
the
clamour
of
bells
the
noise
seemed
deafening
whistles
blowing
from
the
river
guns
firing
and
this
swinging
network
of
bells
echoing
through
the
fog
figures
too
ran
with
lights
men
singing
women
laughing
all
mysteriously
in
the
tangled
darkness
they
were
joined
at
once
by
aunt
anne
who
said
god
has
called
him
home
by
which
maggie
understood
that
warlock
was
dead
they
went
home
in
silence
inside
the
hall
aunt
elizabeth
began
to
cry
aunt
anne
put
her
arm
around
her
and
led
her
away
they
seemed
completely
to
forget
maggie
leaving
her
standing
in
the
dark
hall
by
herself
she
found
a
candle
and
went
up
to
her
room
the
noise
in
the
streets
had
ceased
quite
suddenly
as
though
some
angry
voice
had
called
the
world
to
order
maggie
undressed
and
lay
down
in
her
bed
she
lay
there
staring
in
front
of
her
without
closing
her
eyes
she
watched
the
grey
dawn
then
the
then
behind
her
blind
bright
sunshine
the
fog
was
no
more
the
strangest
fancies
and
visions
passed
through
her
brain
during
that
time
she
saw
warlock
hanging
forward
like
a
sack
of
clothes
the
blood
trickling
stealthily
across
his
beard
poor
old
man
what
were
the
others
all
thinking
now
were
they
sorry
or
glad
were
they
disappointed
or
relieved
after
all
he
had
perhaps
spoken
the
truth
so
far
as
he
was
himself
concerned
god
had
come
for
him
he
was
now
it
might
be
happy
somewhere
at
peace
and
at
rest
then
like
a
flash
of
lightning
across
the
darkness
came
the
thought
of
martin
what
had
he
said
if
anything
happened
to
his
father
the
terror
of
that
made
her
heart
stop
beating
she
wanted
instantly
to
go
to
him
and
see
what
he
was
doing
she
even
rose
from
her
bed
stumbled
in
the
darkness
towards
her
then
remembered
where
she
was
and
what
time
and
went
back
and
sat
upon
her
bed
she
sat
there
her
fingers
tightly
pressed
together
staring
in
front
of
her
until
the
morning
came
she
felt
at
her
heart
a
foreboding
worse
than
any
pain
that
she
had
ever
known
she
determined
that
directly
after
breakfast
whatever
the
aunts
would
say
she
would
go
to
his
house
and
demand
to
see
him
she
did
not
mind
who
might
try
to
prevent
her
she
would
fight
her
way
through
them
all
only
one
look
one
word
of
assurance
from
him
and
then
she
could
endure
anything
that
she
must
have
or
she
would
die
at
last
martha
knocked
on
the
door
she
had
her
bath
dressed
still
with
this
terrible
pain
at
her
heart
she
was
alone
at
breakfast
she
drank
some
coffee
then
went
up
to
the
to
think
for
a
moment
what
course
she
should
pursue
the
room
was
flooded
with
sunlight
that
struck
the
fire
into
a
dead
lifeless
yellow
as
she
stood
there
she
heard
through
the
open
door
voices
in
the
hall
but
before
she
had
heard
the
voices
she
knew
that
it
was
martin
martha
was
expostulating
her
voice
following
his
step
up
the
hall
i
shall
go
and
tell
my
mistress
maggie
heard
then
martin
came
in
when
she
saw
him
she
stood
speechless
where
she
was
the
change
in
him
terrified
her
so
that
her
heart
seemed
to
leap
into
her
throat
choking
her
the
colour
had
drained
from
his
face
leaving
it
dry
and
yellow
he
had
an
amazing
resemblance
to
his
father
his
eyes
had
exactly
the
same
bewildered
expression
as
though
he
were
lost
and
yet
he
seemed
quite
calm
his
only
movement
was
one
hand
that
wandered
up
and
down
his
waistcoat
feeling
the
buttons
one
after
the
other
he
looked
at
her
as
though
he
did
not
know
her
and
yet
he
spoke
her
name
maggie
he
said
i
come
to
say
you
know
what
i
said
before
well
it
come
true
father
is
dead
and
i
killed
him
with
a
terrible
effort
beating
down
a
terror
that
seemed
personally
to
envelop
her
she
said
no
martin
i
saw
him
die
it
was
you
martin
dear
it
was
i
he
answered
you
do
know
i
came
into
the
house
drunk
and
he
heard
what
i
said
to
amy
he
nearly
died
then
the
doctor
in
the
evening
said
he
must
have
had
some
shock
she
tried
to
come
to
him
then
she
was
thinking
oh
if
i
only
got
time
i
can
win
this
but
i
must
have
time
i
must
have
time
he
moved
away
from
her
as
he
had
done
once
before
anyway
it
does
matter
he
said
i
killed
him
by
the
way
been
behaving
to
him
all
these
months
i
going
away
where
i
ca
do
any
harm
she
desperately
calmed
herself
speaking
very
quietly
listen
martin
you
have
done
him
any
harm
he
happier
now
than
he
been
for
years
i
know
he
is
and
that
does
touch
us
you
leave
me
now
where
you
go
i
must
go
no
he
answered
no
maggie
i
ought
to
have
gone
before
i
knew
it
then
but
i
know
it
absolutely
now
everything
i
touch
i
hurt
so
i
must
touch
anything
i
care
for
she
put
her
hands
out
towards
him
words
had
left
her
she
would
have
given
her
soul
for
words
and
she
could
say
nothing
she
was
surrounded
with
a
hedge
of
fright
and
terror
and
she
could
not
pass
it
he
seemed
to
see
then
in
her
eyes
her
despair
for
an
instant
he
recognised
her
their
eyes
met
for
the
first
time
she
felt
that
she
was
winning
she
began
eagerly
to
speak
listen
martin
dear
you
ca
do
me
any
harm
you
can
only
hurt
me
by
leaving
me
i
told
you
before
just
think
of
that
and
only
that
the
door
opened
and
aunt
anne
came
in
he
turned
to
her
very
politely
i
beg
your
pardon
for
coming
miss
cardinal
he
said
i
know
what
you
must
think
of
me
but
it
all
right
i
only
come
to
say
to
maggie
it
all
right
neither
you
nor
maggie
will
be
bothered
with
me
again
he
turned
to
the
open
door
aunt
anne
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
maggie
said
martin
do
go
martin
do
leave
me
do
leave
me
martin
he
seemed
to
break
then
in
his
resolution
it
better
it
better
he
cried
as
though
he
were
shouting
himself
down
and
then
pushing
aunt
anne
with
his
arm
he
hurried
out
almost
running
his
steps
stumbling
down
the
stairs
maggie
ran
to
the
door
her
aunt
stopped
her
holding
her
back
it
better
maggie
dear
she
said
very
gently
repeating
words
the
sound
of
the
hall
door
closing
echoed
through
the
house
maggie
struggled
crying
again
and
again
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
must
go
with
him
i
ca
live
without
him
let
me
go
she
fought
then
and
with
one
hand
free
hit
aunt
anne
face
twisting
her
body
then
suddenly
weak
so
that
she
saw
faintness
coming
towards
her
like
a
cloak
she
whispered
oh
aunt
anne
let
me
go
oh
aunt
anne
let
me
go
please
please
let
me
go
suddenly
the
house
was
darkened
at
her
feet
was
a
gulf
of
blackness
and
into
it
she
tumbled
down
far
down
with
a
last
little
gasping
sigh
of
distress
part
iii
the
witch
chapter
i
the
three
visits
on
a
spring
day
early
in
march
of
the
next
year
mathew
cardinal
thought
that
he
would
go
and
discover
how
his
niece
was
prospering
he
had
seen
nothing
of
her
for
a
very
long
time
he
did
not
blame
himself
for
this
but
then
he
never
blamed
himself
for
anything
a
fate
often
drunken
and
always
imbecile
was
to
blame
for
everything
that
he
did
and
he
pitied
himself
sincerely
for
having
to
be
in
the
hands
of
such
a
creature
he
happened
to
be
just
now
very
considerably
frightened
about
himself
more
frightened
than
he
had
been
for
a
very
long
time
so
frightened
in
fact
that
he
had
drunk
nothing
for
weeks
for
many
years
he
had
been
leading
a
existence
and
the
had
been
swung
by
that
mysterious
force
known
as
finance
he
had
a
real
gift
for
speculation
and
had
he
been
granted
from
birth
a
large
income
he
might
have
ended
his
days
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
a
member
of
parliament
unfortunately
he
had
never
had
any
private
means
and
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
enough
by
his
mysterious
speculations
to
float
him
into
security
let
me
once
get
so
far
he
would
say
to
himself
and
i
am
a
made
man
but
drink
an
easy
tolerance
of
bad
company
and
a
rather
touching
conceit
had
combined
to
divorce
him
from
so
fine
a
destiny
he
had
risen
he
had
fallen
made
a
good
thing
out
of
this
tip
been
badly
done
over
that
and
missed
opportunity
after
opportunity
through
a
fuddled
brain
and
an
overweening
last
year
for
several
months
everything
had
succeeded
it
was
during
that
happy
period
that
he
had
visited
maggie
perhaps
it
was
well
for
his
soul
that
success
had
not
continued
he
was
a
man
whom
failure
improved
having
a
certain
childish
warmth
of
heart
and
simplicity
of
outlook
when
things
went
badly
with
him
success
made
him
abominably
conceited
and
being
without
any
morality
drove
him
to
disastrous
lengths
now
once
more
he
was
very
near
destruction
and
he
knew
it
very
near
things
like
forging
and
highway
robbery
and
other
things
worse
than
they
he
knew
that
he
was
very
near
he
peered
over
into
the
pit
and
did
not
wish
to
descend
he
was
not
a
bad
man
and
had
he
not
believed
himself
to
be
a
clever
one
all
might
yet
have
been
well
the
temptation
of
his
cleverness
lured
him
on
a
stroke
of
the
pen
was
a
very
simple
thing
to
save
his
soul
he
thought
that
he
would
go
and
see
maggie
his
affection
for
her
conceited
and
selfish
though
it
was
was
the
most
genuine
thing
in
him
for
of
the
year
he
forgot
her
but
when
life
went
badly
he
thought
of
her
again
not
that
he
expected
to
get
anything
out
of
her
but
she
was
good
to
him
and
she
knew
nothing
about
his
life
two
fine
bases
for
safety
what
have
they
been
doing
to
her
those
damned
hypocrites
i
wonder
was
his
thought
he
admired
feared
and
despised
his
sisters
all
that
stuff
about
god
frightened
him
in
spite
of
himself
and
he
knew
in
his
soul
that
anne
was
no
hypocrite
he
rang
the
bell
and
faced
martha
he
had
dressed
himself
with
some
care
and
was
altogether
more
tidy
just
then
having
a
new
mistress
who
cared
about
outside
appearances
also
having
been
sober
for
nearly
two
months
he
looked
a
gentleman
is
my
niece
at
home
he
asked
blinking
because
he
was
frightened
of
martha
she
did
not
seem
to
be
prepared
to
let
him
in
miss
maggie
has
been
very
ill
she
said
frowning
at
him
ill
that
really
hurt
him
he
stammered
why
when
she
moved
aside
then
for
him
to
pass
into
the
hall
he
came
into
the
dark
stuffy
place
yes
said
martha
just
after
christmas
the
doctors
said
they
thought
she
die
for
weeks
had
two
doctors
you
see
her
sir
she
ended
grumpily
then
aunt
anne
appeared
coming
through
the
door
why
mathew
she
said
mathew
thought
how
ill
she
looked
they
all
ill
here
he
said
to
himself
so
maggie
ill
he
said
dropping
his
eyes
before
her
as
he
always
did
yes
aunt
anne
answered
she
was
very
ill
indeed
poor
child
glad
to
see
you
mathew
it
a
long
time
since
you
been
he
thought
she
was
gentler
to
him
than
she
had
been
so
mastering
his
fear
of
her
fingering
his
collar
he
said
ca
i
see
her
well
i
not
i
think
you
might
it
might
do
her
good
she
wants
taking
out
of
herself
she
comes
down
for
an
hour
or
two
every
day
now
i
go
and
see
she
left
him
standing
alone
there
he
looked
around
him
sniffing
like
a
dog
how
he
hated
the
house
and
everything
in
it
always
had
you
could
smell
that
fellow
warlock
trail
over
everything
the
black
cat
tom
came
slipping
along
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
would
rub
himself
against
mathew
stout
legs
then
decided
that
he
would
not
mysterious
this
place
like
a
well
with
its
green
shadows
no
wonder
the
poor
child
had
been
ill
here
at
the
thought
of
her
being
near
to
death
mathew
felt
a
choke
in
his
throat
poor
child
never
had
any
fun
all
her
life
and
then
to
die
in
a
green
well
like
this
and
his
sisters
would
care
if
she
did
hard
women
hard
women
funny
how
religion
made
you
hard
darn
funny
good
thing
he
been
irreligious
all
his
life
think
of
his
brother
charles
there
was
religion
for
you
living
with
his
cook
and
preaching
to
her
next
morning
bad
thing
religion
aunt
anne
returned
coming
down
the
stairs
with
that
queer
halting
gait
of
hers
maggie
in
the
she
said
she
like
to
see
you
as
they
went
up
aunt
anne
said
be
careful
with
her
mathew
still
very
weak
do
say
anything
to
upset
her
he
mumbled
something
in
his
throat
could
trust
him
of
course
they
could
never
had
fine
sort
of
sisters
they
were
maggie
was
sitting
by
the
fire
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
by
god
but
she
looked
mathew
had
another
gulp
in
his
throat
poor
kid
but
she
did
look
poor
kid
poor
kid
sorry
you
been
bad
maggie
he
said
she
looked
up
smiling
with
pleasure
when
she
saw
who
it
was
yes
she
was
really
pleased
to
see
him
but
how
different
a
smile
from
the
old
one
no
blood
behind
it
none
of
that
old
maggie
determination
he
was
filled
with
compassion
he
took
a
chair
close
beside
her
and
sat
down
leaning
towards
her
his
large
rather
sheepish
eye
gazing
at
her
what
been
the
matter
he
asked
i
do
know
maggie
said
i
was
suddenly
ill
one
day
and
after
that
i
did
know
any
more
for
weeks
but
i
much
better
now
well
i
delighted
to
hear
that
anyway
he
said
heartily
he
was
determined
to
cheer
her
up
you
be
as
right
as
rain
presently
of
course
i
shall
i
felt
so
lazy
as
though
i
did
want
to
do
anything
now
i
must
stir
myself
have
the
old
women
been
good
to
you
he
asked
dropping
his
voice
very
she
answered
not
bothering
you
about
all
their
religious
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
no
she
said
and
that
hypocritical
minister
of
theirs
has
been
at
you
again
warlock
dead
she
answered
very
quietly
warlock
dead
uncle
mathew
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
astonishment
that
fellow
dead
well
i
damned
indeed
i
am
that
fellow
well
there
a
good
riddance
i
know
it
is
good
form
to
speak
about
a
man
who
kicked
the
bucket
otherwise
than
kindly
but
he
was
a
weight
on
my
chest
that
fellow
was
with
his
long
white
beard
and
his
soft
voice
well
well
to
be
sure
whatever
will
my
poor
sisters
do
and
what
happened
to
that
young
chap
his
son
nice
lad
he
was
took
dinner
with
us
that
day
last
year
he
gone
away
said
maggie
mathew
stupid
though
he
was
heard
behind
the
quiet
of
maggie
voice
a
warning
he
flung
her
a
hurried
surreptitious
look
her
face
was
perfectly
composed
her
hands
still
upon
her
lap
nevertheless
he
said
to
himself
danger
there
my
boy
something
happened
there
and
yet
his
curiosity
drove
him
for
a
moment
further
gone
has
he
where
to
he
went
abroad
said
maggie
after
his
father
death
i
do
know
where
he
gone
oh
did
he
pity
restless
i
expect
i
was
at
his
age
there
was
a
little
pause
between
them
when
maggie
sat
very
quietly
looking
at
her
hands
then
smiling
she
glanced
up
and
said
but
tell
me
about
yourself
uncle
mathew
you
told
me
nothing
he
fidgeted
a
little
shifting
his
thick
legs
stroking
his
nose
with
his
finger
i
do
know
that
i
anything
very
good
to
tell
you
my
dear
truth
is
i
have
been
doing
so
very
well
lately
oh
uncle
i
sorry
it
nothing
to
make
yourself
miserable
about
my
dear
i
always
turn
my
corners
damn
rocky
ones
they
are
sometimes
too
everything
turned
itself
wrong
these
last
weeks
either
too
soon
or
too
late
i
complain
all
the
same
it
makes
things
a
bit
inconvenient
thank
you
for
that
five
pounds
you
sent
me
my
dear
very
helpful
it
was
i
can
tell
you
do
you
want
another
five
pounds
she
asked
him
he
struggled
with
himself
his
hesitation
was
so
obvious
that
it
was
quite
touching
she
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
do
have
another
five
pounds
uncle
it
wo
be
difficult
for
me
at
all
i
been
spending
nothing
all
these
weeks
when
i
been
ill
please
do
he
shook
his
head
firmly
no
my
dear
i
wo
as
i
came
along
i
said
to
myself
be
asking
maggie
for
money
and
when
she
says
yes
you
not
to
take
it
and
so
i
not
going
to
i
may
be
a
rotter
but
i
not
a
rotten
rotter
he
clung
to
his
decision
with
the
utmost
resolve
as
though
it
were
his
last
plank
of
respectability
i
ca
believe
he
said
to
her
with
great
solemnity
that
things
can
really
go
wrong
i
know
too
much
it
is
men
like
me
who
go
under
no
no
he
saw
then
her
white
face
and
strange
grey
ghostly
eyes
as
though
her
soul
had
gone
somewhere
on
a
visit
and
the
house
was
untenanted
he
felt
again
the
gulp
in
his
throat
he
bent
forward
resting
his
fat
podgy
hand
on
her
knee
do
you
worry
maggie
dear
i
always
noticed
that
things
are
never
bad
for
long
you
still
got
your
old
uncle
and
you
young
and
there
are
plenty
of
fish
in
the
sea
there
are
indeed
you
cheer
up
it
will
be
all
right
soon
she
put
her
hands
on
his
oh
i
not
worrying
but
as
she
spoke
a
strange
strangled
little
sob
had
crept
unbidden
into
her
throat
choking
her
he
thought
as
he
got
up
it
that
damned
young
feller
i
gave
dinner
to
i
like
to
wring
his
neck
but
he
said
no
more
bent
closer
and
kissed
her
said
he
was
soon
coming
again
and
went
away
after
he
had
gone
the
house
sank
into
its
grey
quiet
again
what
was
maggie
thinking
no
one
knew
what
was
aunt
anne
thinking
no
one
knew
but
there
was
something
between
these
two
maggie
and
aunt
anne
every
one
felt
it
and
longed
for
the
storm
to
burst
bad
enough
things
outside
with
warlock
dead
members
leaving
right
and
left
and
the
chapel
generally
going
to
wrack
and
ruin
but
inside
old
martha
who
had
never
liked
maggie
felt
now
a
strange
uncomfortable
pity
for
her
she
did
want
to
feel
pity
no
not
she
pity
for
no
one
and
especially
not
for
an
ugly
untidy
girl
like
that
but
there
it
was
she
could
help
herself
such
a
child
that
girl
and
she
been
as
nearly
dead
as
nothing
and
now
she
was
suffering
suffering
awful
any
one
could
see
all
that
warlock
boy
martha
had
seen
him
come
stumbling
down
the
stairs
that
day
and
had
heard
maggie
cry
and
then
the
fall
awful
noise
it
made
awful
she
stood
in
the
hall
looking
up
the
stairs
her
heart
beating
like
a
hammer
yes
just
like
a
hammer
then
she
gone
up
it
was
a
nice
sight
the
poor
girl
all
in
a
lump
on
the
floor
and
miss
anne
just
as
she
always
looked
before
one
of
her
attacks
as
though
she
were
made
of
grey
glass
from
top
to
toe
but
martha
had
pitied
maggie
then
oh
no
might
as
well
die
as
not
who
wanted
her
no
one
not
even
her
young
man
apparently
better
if
she
died
but
slowly
something
happened
to
martha
not
that
she
was
sentimental
not
in
the
least
but
thoughts
would
steal
in
steal
in
just
when
you
were
at
your
work
the
girl
lying
there
so
good
and
patient
all
the
pots
and
pans
winking
at
you
from
the
must
remember
to
order
that
ketchup
cold
last
night
in
bed
think
another
blanket
yes
very
good
and
patient
ca
deny
it
always
smiles
just
that
same
way
smiles
at
every
one
except
miss
arne
wo
smile
at
her
wonder
why
not
something
between
those
two
what
about
dinner
a
little
onion
fry
that
the
thing
these
damp
days
onion
fry
onion
fry
onion
fry
one
last
look
back
before
the
world
is
filled
with
the
sense
smell
and
taste
of
poor
girl
so
white
and
so
patient
the
young
man
will
never
come
back
never
never
onion
fry
no
no
one
knew
what
maggie
was
thinking
no
one
found
out
until
maggie
had
her
second
visitor
miss
avies
when
martha
opened
the
door
to
miss
avies
she
was
astonished
miss
avies
had
been
near
the
house
since
old
warlock
died
what
was
she
wanting
here
now
with
her
stiff
back
and
bossy
manner
i
do
know
whether
you
can
see
oh
nonsense
it
maggie
cardinal
i
want
to
see
she
now
in
the
sitting
on
a
chair
with
a
shawl
on
by
the
fire
do
tell
me
martha
quivered
with
anger
the
doctor
orders
is
i
going
to
be
doctor
she
said
and
strode
inside
she
went
upstairs
and
found
aunt
elizabeth
sitting
with
maggie
how
do
you
do
miss
cardinal
they
shook
hands
miss
avies
standing
over
aunt
elizabeth
like
the
boa
constrictor
raised
above
the
mouse
that
all
right
no
i
do
want
to
see
your
sister
and
to
be
quite
honest
i
do
want
to
see
you
either
it
your
niece
i
want
to
see
and
alone
certainly
it
only
the
doctor
said
not
to
excite
her
i
know
but
i
not
going
to
excite
her
i
going
to
give
her
some
medicine
you
come
back
in
half
an
hour
from
now
will
you
that
right
thank
you
so
much
aunt
elizabeth
unhappy
uncomfortable
filled
with
misgivings
as
in
these
days
she
always
was
left
the
room
well
there
that
right
said
miss
avies
settling
herself
in
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
from
maggie
and
looking
at
her
with
not
unfriendly
eyes
how
are
you
oh
much
better
thank
you
said
maggie
ever
so
much
better
no
you
not
said
miss
avies
and
you
only
lying
when
you
say
you
are
you
never
get
better
unless
you
do
what
i
tell
you
what
that
asked
maggie
face
things
face
everything
have
it
all
out
do
leave
a
bit
of
it
alone
and
then
just
keep
what
useful
i
do
quite
know
what
you
mean
said
maggie
but
the
faint
colour
had
faded
from
her
cheeks
and
her
hands
had
run
together
for
protection
miss
avies
voice
softened
i
probably
going
away
very
soon
she
said
going
away
and
not
coming
back
all
my
work
over
here
but
i
wanted
to
see
you
before
i
went
you
remember
another
talk
we
had
here
very
well
said
maggie
you
remember
what
i
told
you
you
told
me
not
to
stay
here
said
maggie
yes
i
did
said
miss
avies
and
i
meant
it
the
matter
with
you
is
that
you
been
kept
here
all
this
time
without
any
proper
work
to
do
and
that
been
very
bad
for
you
and
made
you
sit
with
your
hands
folded
in
front
of
you
your
head
filling
with
silly
fancies
maggie
could
help
smiling
at
this
description
of
herself
oh
you
smile
said
miss
avies
vigorously
but
it
perfectly
true
well
it
all
right
now
said
maggie
because
i
am
going
away
as
soon
as
ever
i
well
enough
what
to
do
asked
miss
avies
i
do
quite
know
yet
said
maggie
well
i
know
said
miss
avies
you
going
away
to
brood
over
that
young
man
maggie
said
nothing
oh
i
know
it
seems
cruel
of
me
to
speak
of
it
just
when
you
had
such
a
bad
time
but
it
kindness
really
if
i
do
force
you
to
think
it
all
out
and
face
it
properly
you
be
burying
it
in
some
precious
spot
and
always
digging
it
up
to
look
at
it
you
face
it
my
girl
you
say
to
yourself
well
he
was
such
a
wonderful
young
man
after
all
i
can
lead
my
life
all
right
without
him
of
course
i
can
i
not
going
to
be
dependent
on
him
and
sigh
and
groan
and
waste
away
because
i
ca
see
him
i
know
what
it
is
i
been
through
it
myself
then
there
was
a
pause
then
maggie
suddenly
looked
up
and
smiled
but
you
quite
wrong
miss
avies
i
no
intention
of
not
facing
martin
and
i
no
intention
either
of
having
my
life
ruined
because
he
not
here
at
first
when
i
was
very
ill
i
was
unhappy
and
then
i
saw
how
silly
i
was
why
said
miss
avies
with
great
pleasure
you
got
over
it
already
i
must
say
i
delighted
because
i
never
thought
much
of
martin
warlock
if
you
want
to
know
my
dear
i
always
thought
him
a
weak
young
man
and
he
would
have
done
you
any
good
delighted
indeed
i
am
that
not
true
either
said
maggie
quietly
if
by
getting
over
it
you
mean
that
i
do
love
martin
you
quite
wrong
i
loved
him
the
first
moment
i
saw
him
and
i
shall
love
him
in
just
the
same
way
until
i
die
i
do
think
it
matters
what
he
does
or
where
he
is
so
far
as
loving
him
goes
but
that
does
mean
i
sitting
and
pining
i
not
miss
avies
looked
at
her
with
displeasure
it
the
same
thing
then
she
said
you
may
fancy
you
going
to
lead
an
ordinary
life
again
but
all
the
time
you
just
be
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
no
said
maggie
i
shall
not
i
had
plenty
of
time
for
thinking
these
last
weeks
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
his
never
coming
back
never
at
all
and
even
if
he
did
come
back
he
might
want
me
so
i
not
going
to
waste
time
about
it
i
shall
find
work
and
make
myself
useful
somewhere
but
i
shall
always
love
martin
just
as
i
do
now
you
very
young
said
miss
avies
touched
in
spite
of
herself
later
on
you
find
some
one
much
better
than
young
warlock
perhaps
i
shall
said
maggie
but
what
the
use
of
that
if
he
martin
i
heard
people
say
that
before
some
one
or
or
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
love
martin
because
he
martin
he
got
a
weak
character
you
say
why
he
wants
me
and
i
want
to
be
wanted
more
than
anything
on
earth
why
child
said
miss
avies
astonished
how
you
grown
these
last
weeks
do
you
want
to
know
how
i
love
martin
said
maggie
so
that
there
shall
be
no
mistake
about
it
well
i
ca
tell
you
i
could
tell
any
one
i
do
know
how
i
love
him
but
i
know
that
i
shall
never
change
or
alter
all
my
life
even
though
he
never
comes
back
again
i
given
over
being
silly
she
went
on
there
were
days
and
days
at
first
when
i
just
wanted
to
die
but
now
i
going
to
make
my
own
life
and
have
a
good
time
and
never
stop
loving
martin
for
one
single
second
supposing
said
miss
avies
some
one
wanted
to
marry
you
would
you
it
would
depend
said
maggie
if
i
liked
him
and
he
really
wanted
me
and
i
could
help
him
i
might
only
of
course
i
tell
him
about
martin
first
she
went
on
after
a
little
pause
you
see
miss
avies
i
have
been
very
happy
with
my
aunts
and
i
always
thought
it
was
their
fault
that
i
was
but
during
these
weeks
when
i
been
lying
in
bed
i
saw
that
it
was
my
own
fault
for
being
so
gloomy
about
everything
now
that
got
martin
got
him
interrupted
miss
avies
why
you
only
just
lost
him
no
i
have
answered
maggie
he
did
go
away
because
he
hated
me
or
was
tired
of
me
he
went
away
because
he
did
want
to
do
me
any
harm
and
i
think
he
cared
for
me
more
just
at
that
minute
than
ever
done
before
so
i
nothing
to
spoil
my
memory
of
him
i
daresay
we
would
have
got
on
well
together
i
do
think
i
would
ever
have
fascinated
him
enough
to
keep
him
with
me
for
very
long
but
now
i
know
that
he
loved
me
at
the
very
moment
he
went
away
and
was
thinking
how
ugly
i
was
or
what
a
nasty
temper
i
had
or
how
irritating
i
could
be
but
my
dear
child
said
miss
avies
astonished
how
can
you
say
you
loved
one
another
if
you
were
always
quarrelling
and
expecting
to
part
we
were
always
quarrelling
said
maggie
we
together
enough
but
if
we
had
been
it
would
have
meant
that
we
did
love
one
another
i
do
think
we
ever
been
very
happy
but
being
happy
together
does
seem
to
me
the
only
sign
of
love
love
seems
to
me
to
be
moments
of
great
joy
rising
from
every
kind
of
trouble
and
bother
i
do
call
tranquillity
happiness
well
you
have
thought
things
out
said
miss
avies
and
all
of
us
considering
you
so
stupid
i
not
going
to
squash
myself
into
a
corner
any
more
said
maggie
why
should
i
i
find
i
as
good
as
any
one
else
i
made
martin
love
me
even
though
it
was
only
for
a
moment
so
i
going
to
be
shy
no
longer
and
here
was
i
thinking
you
said
miss
avies
i
going
out
into
the
world
said
maggie
half
to
herself
i
going
to
have
adventures
i
been
in
this
house
long
enough
i
going
to
see
what
men
and
women
are
really
like
i
know
this
is
real
here
and
i
want
to
discover
about
religion
too
since
martin
went
away
felt
that
there
was
something
in
it
i
ca
think
what
and
the
aunts
ca
think
either
none
of
you
know
here
but
some
one
must
have
found
out
something
i
going
to
settle
what
it
all
means
you
got
your
work
cut
out
said
miss
avies
i
come
and
see
you
again
one
day
soon
yes
do
said
maggie
when
miss
avies
had
gone
maggie
realised
that
she
had
been
talking
with
bravado
in
fact
she
hid
her
head
in
the
cushion
of
the
chair
and
cried
for
at
least
five
minutes
then
she
sat
up
and
wiped
her
eyes
because
she
heard
aunt
anne
coming
when
aunt
anne
came
towards
her
now
she
was
affected
with
a
strange
feeling
of
sickness
she
told
herself
that
that
was
part
of
her
illness
she
did
not
hate
aunt
anne
for
some
weeks
when
she
had
risen
slowly
from
the
nightmare
that
the
first
period
of
her
illness
had
been
she
hated
aunt
anne
hated
her
fiercely
absorbingly
desperately
then
suddenly
the
hatred
had
left
her
and
had
she
only
known
it
she
was
from
that
moment
never
to
hate
any
one
again
a
quite
new
love
for
martin
was
suddenly
born
in
her
a
love
that
was
as
yet
like
the
first
faint
stirring
of
the
child
in
the
mother
womb
this
new
love
was
quite
different
from
the
old
that
had
been
acquisitive
possessive
urgent
restless
and
often
terribly
painful
this
was
tranquil
sure
utterly
certain
and
passive
the
immediate
fruit
of
it
was
that
she
regarded
all
human
creatures
with
a
lively
interest
an
interest
too
absorbing
to
allow
of
hatred
or
even
active
dislike
her
love
for
martin
was
now
like
a
strong
current
in
her
soul
washing
away
all
sense
of
irritation
and
anger
she
regarded
people
from
a
new
angle
what
were
they
all
about
what
were
they
thinking
had
they
too
had
some
experience
as
marvellous
as
her
meeting
with
and
parting
from
martin
probably
and
they
too
were
shy
of
speaking
of
it
her
love
for
martin
slowly
grew
a
love
now
independent
of
earthly
contact
and
earthly
desire
a
treasure
that
would
be
hers
so
long
as
life
lasted
that
no
one
could
take
from
her
she
no
longer
hated
aunt
anne
but
she
did
not
intend
to
live
with
her
any
more
so
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
she
would
go
that
moment
of
physical
contact
when
aunt
anne
had
held
her
back
made
any
more
relation
between
them
impossible
there
was
now
a
great
gulf
fixed
the
loneliness
the
sense
of
desperate
loss
above
all
the
agonising
longing
for
martin
his
step
his
voice
his
smile
she
faced
all
these
and
accepted
them
as
necessary
companions
now
on
her
life
journey
but
she
did
not
intend
to
allow
them
to
impede
progress
she
wondered
now
about
everybody
her
own
experience
had
shown
her
what
strange
and
wonderful
things
occur
to
all
human
beings
and
in
the
face
of
this
how
could
one
hate
or
grudge
or
despise
she
had
a
fellowship
now
with
all
humanity
but
she
was
as
ignorant
about
life
as
ever
the
things
that
now
she
wanted
to
know
about
aunt
anne
for
instance
how
had
she
been
affected
by
warlock
death
and
the
disappointment
of
her
expectations
the
chapel
now
apparently
was
to
be
taken
over
by
thurston
who
had
married
amy
warlock
and
was
full
of
schemes
and
enterprises
maggie
knew
that
the
aunts
went
now
very
seldom
to
chapel
and
the
inside
saints
were
apparently
in
pieces
was
aunt
anne
utterly
broken
by
all
this
she
did
not
seem
to
be
so
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
as
she
had
been
except
that
she
was
in
her
room
now
a
great
deal
her
health
appeared
on
the
whole
to
be
better
than
it
had
been
and
what
was
aunt
elizabeth
thinking
and
martha
and
miss
avies
and
caroline
smith
no
she
must
get
out
into
the
world
and
discover
these
things
for
herself
she
did
not
know
how
the
way
of
escape
would
come
but
she
was
certain
of
its
arrival
it
arrived
and
through
her
third
visitor
her
third
visitor
was
mark
when
katherine
mark
came
in
maggie
was
writing
to
uncle
mathew
she
put
aside
her
with
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
mark
the
very
last
person
in
all
the
world
whom
she
had
expected
to
see
as
she
saw
her
come
in
she
had
a
swift
intuition
that
this
was
destiny
now
that
was
dealing
with
her
and
that
a
new
scene
involving
every
sort
of
new
experience
and
adventure
was
opening
before
her
more
than
ever
before
she
realised
how
far
katherine
mark
was
from
the
world
in
which
she
maggie
had
during
all
these
months
been
living
katherine
mark
was
real
real
in
her
beautiful
quiet
clothes
in
her
assurance
her
ease
the
sense
that
she
gave
that
she
knew
life
and
love
and
business
and
all
the
affairs
of
men
at
first
hand
not
only
seen
through
a
mist
of
superstition
and
ignorance
or
indeed
not
seen
at
all
this
is
what
i
want
something
in
maggie
called
to
her
this
will
make
me
busy
and
quiet
and
sensible
at
last
when
katherine
mark
sat
down
and
took
her
hand
for
a
moment
smiling
at
her
in
the
kindliest
way
maggie
felt
as
though
she
had
known
her
all
her
life
oh
i
so
glad
you
come
she
cried
spontaneously
and
then
as
though
she
felt
she
gone
too
far
she
blushed
and
drew
back
but
katherine
held
her
hand
fast
i
wrote
she
said
some
weeks
ago
to
you
and
your
aunt
answered
the
letter
saying
you
were
very
then
as
i
heard
nothing
of
you
i
was
anxious
and
came
to
see
what
had
happened
you
not
kept
your
word
maggie
you
know
we
were
to
have
been
great
friends
and
you
never
been
near
me
at
the
use
of
her
christian
name
maggie
blushed
with
pleasure
i
could
come
she
said
i
did
want
to
until
until
until
some
things
had
settled
themselves
well
and
they
have
asked
katherine
yes
they
have
said
maggie
what
been
the
matter
asked
katherine
i
was
worried
about
something
and
then
i
was
ill
said
maggie
and
you
not
worried
now
said
katherine
i
not
going
to
give
in
to
it
anyway
said
maggie
as
soon
as
well
i
off
i
find
some
work
somewhere
i
got
a
plan
said
katherine
it
came
into
my
head
the
moment
i
saw
you
sitting
there
will
you
come
and
stay
with
us
for
a
little
that
sense
that
maggie
had
had
when
she
saw
katherine
of
fate
having
a
hand
in
all
of
this
deepened
now
and
coloured
her
thoughts
so
that
she
could
feel
no
surprise
but
only
a
curious
instinct
that
she
had
been
through
all
this
scene
before
stay
with
you
she
cried
oh
i
should
love
to
that
good
said
katherine
your
aunts
wo
mind
will
they
they
ca
keep
me
said
maggie
i
free
but
they
wo
want
to
our
time
together
is
over
i
come
and
fetch
you
said
katherine
you
shall
stay
with
us
until

well
and
then
we
find
some
work
for
you
why
are
you
good
to
me
like
this
maggie
asked
i
not
good
to
you
katherine
answered
laughing
it
simply
selfish
it
will
be
lovely
for
me
having
you
with
me
oh
you
do
know
said
maggie
throwing
up
her
head
no
i
do
think
i
come
i
frightened
i
not
what
you
think
i
untidy
and
careless
and
ca
talk
to
strangers
perhaps
i
lose
you
altogether
as
a
friend
if
i
come
you
never
do
that
said
katherine
suddenly
bending
forward
and
kissing
her
i
do
change
about
people
it
because
i
have
any
imagination
phil
says
i
shall
make
mistakes
maggie
said
i
never
been
anywhere
but
i
do
care
i
can
look
after
myself
the
thought
of
her
three
hundred
pounds
which
were
no
longer
three
hundred
encouraged
her
she
kissed
katherine
i
do
change
either
she
said
she
had
a
strange
conversation
with
aunt
anne
that
night
strange
as
every
talk
had
always
been
because
of
things
left
unsaid
they
faced
one
another
across
the
fireplace
like
enemies
who
might
have
been
lovers
there
had
been
from
the
very
first
moment
of
this
meeting
a
romantic
link
between
them
which
had
never
been
defined
they
had
never
had
it
out
with
one
another
and
they
were
not
going
to
have
it
out
now
but
maggie
who
was
never
sentimental
wondered
at
the
strange
mixture
of
tenderness
pity
affection
irritation
and
hostility
that
she
felt
aunt
anne
i
going
away
said
maggie
aunt
anne
looked
up
with
her
strange
hostile
arrogance
oh
no
maggie
you
not
well
yet
mark
said
maggie
the
lady
i
told
you
about
is
coming
in
a
motor
to
fetch
me
she
will
take
me
straight
to
her
house
and
then
i
shall
go
to
bed
aunt
anne
said
nothing
you
know
that
it
better
for
me
to
go
said
maggie
we
ca
live
together
any
more
after
what
happened
you
and
aunt
elizabeth
have
been
very
very
good
to
me
but
you
know
now
that
i
a
disappointment
i
have
ever
fitted
into
the
life
here
i
never
shall
the
life
here
is
over
said
aunt
anne
everything
is
over
the
house
is
dead
of
course
you
must
go
if
you
feel
anger
with
me
now
or
afterwards
remember
that
i
have
lost
every
hope
or
desire
i
ever
had
i
do
want
your
pity
i
want
no
one
pity
i
wanted
once
your
affection
but
i
wanted
it
on
my
own
terms
that
was
wrong
i
do
not
want
your
affection
any
longer
you
were
never
the
girl
i
thought
you
you
a
strange
girl
maggie
and
you
will
have
i
am
afraid
a
very
unhappy
life
no
i
will
not
said
maggie
i
will
have
a
happy
life
that
is
for
god
to
say
said
aunt
anne
no
it
is
not
said
maggie
i
can
make
my
own
happiness
god
touch
it
if
i
do
let
him
maggie
you
blasphemous
said
aunt
anne
but
not
in
anger
i
not
said
maggie
when
i
came
here
first
i
did
believe
in
god
but
now
i
not
sure
there
something
strange
which
may
be
god
for
all
i
know
i
going
to
find
out
if
he
has
the
doing
of
everything
then
he
taken
away
all
i
cared
for
and
i
not
going
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
it
hurt
if
he
did
do
it
then
it
does
matter
you
believe
in
him
before
you
die
maggie
said
aunt
anne
in
you
and
you
wo
escape
it
i
thought
it
was
i
who
was
to
bring
you
to
him
but
i
was
going
too
fast
the
lord
has
his
own
time
come
to
him
afterwards
oh
cried
maggie
i
so
glad
i
going
somewhere
where
it
wo
be
always
religion
where
they
think
of
something
else
than
the
lord
and
his
coming
i
want
real
life
banks
and
and
shops
and
clothes
and
work
she
stopped
suddenly
aunt
anne
was
doing
what
maggie
had
never
seen
her
do
before
even
in
the
worst
bouts
of
her
pain
she
was
crying
cold
solitary
lonely
tears
that
crept
slowly
reluctantly
down
her
thin
cheeks
i
meant
to
do
well
in
everything
i
have
done
ill
everything
has
failed
in
my
hands
once
again
as
long
before
at
dreot
maggie
could
do
nothing
there
was
a
long
miserable
silence
then
aunt
anne
got
up
and
went
away
next
day
katherine
came
in
a
beautiful
to
fetch
maggie
maggie
had
packed
her
few
things
bound
her
neck
next
her
skin
was
the
ring
with
three
pearls
she
said
to
the
house
her
bedroom
beneath
which
the
clanged
the
with
the
family
group
the
passage
with
the
armed
men
the
dark
hall
with
the
green
baize
door
then
to
aunt
elizabeth
two
kisses
aunt
anne
one
kiss
martha
thomas
the
cat
the
parrot
all
everything
may
i
never
see
any
of
you
again
never
never
never
never
she
was
helped
into
the
car
rugs
were
wrapped
round
her
there
was
a
warm
cosy
smell
of
rich
leather
a
little
clock
ticked
away
a
silver
vase
with
red
and
blue
flowers
winked
at
her
and
katherine
was
there
close
beside
her
never
again
never
again
and
yet
how
strange
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
down
into
the
strand
maggie
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
regret
of
pathos
of
loneliness
as
though
she
were
leaving
something
that
had
loved
her
dearly
and
leaving
it
without
a
word
of
friendliness
poor
dear
she
wanted
to
return
to
tell
it
to
tell
it
what
she
had
made
her
choice
she
was
plunging
now
into
the
other
half
of
the
world
and
plunging
not
quite
alone
because
she
was
taking
martin
with
her
i
do
hope
you
wo
mind
dear
said
katherine
my
cousin
paul
the
clergyman
you
met
once
is
staying
with
us
he
and
his
sister
no
one
else
oh
i
sha
mind
said
maggie
her
fingers
inside
her
blouse
tightly
clutched
the
little
pearl
ring
chapter
ii
plunge
into
the
other
half
for
a
week
maggie
was
so
comfortable
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
had
never
before
known
what
comfort
was
never
at
dreot
never
at
aunt
anne
and
these
two
places
had
been
the
background
of
all
her
life
she
had
never
conceived
of
the
kind
of
way
that
she
now
lived
her
bedroom
was
so
pretty
that
it
made
her
almost
cry
to
look
at
it
the
scattered
with
little
rosy
trees
the
soft
pink
cretonne
on
the
chairs
the
old
bureau
with
a
sheet
of
glass
covering
its
surface
that
was
her
the
old
gold
mirror
all
these
things
were
wonders
indeed
she
was
ordered
to
have
breakfast
in
bed
servants
looked
after
her
with
a
kindliness
and
ease
and
readiness
to
help
that
she
had
never
dreamed
of
as
possible
the
food
was
wonderful
there
was
the
motor
ready
to
take
her
for
a
drive
in
the
afternoon
and
there
was
the
whole
house
at
her
service
soft
and
cosy
and
ordered
so
that
it
seemed
to
roll
along
upon
its
own
impulse
without
any
human
agency
i
believe
if
every
one
went
away
and
left
it
she
thought
it
would
go
on
in
exactly
the
same
way
figures
gradually
took
their
places
in
front
of
this
background
the
principals
at
first
were
katherine
and
philip
henry
and
millicent
katherine
brother
and
sister
trenchard
senior
father
lady
rachel
seddon
katherine
best
friend
and
faunder
katherine
uncle
she
saw
at
once
that
they
all
revolved
around
katherine
if
katherine
were
not
there
they
would
not
hold
together
at
all
they
were
all
so
different
so
different
and
yet
so
strangely
alike
there
was
for
instance
millicent
trenchard
whom
maggie
liked
best
of
them
all
after
katherine
millie
was
a
young
woman
of
pretty
gay
ferociously
independent
enthusiastic
about
one
thing
after
another
with
hosts
of
friends
male
and
female
none
of
whom
she
took
very
seriously
the
love
of
her
life
she
told
maggie
almost
at
once
was
katherine
she
would
never
love
any
one
man
or
woman
so
much
again
she
lived
with
her
mother
and
father
in
an
old
house
in
westminster
and
maggie
understood
that
there
had
been
some
trouble
about
katherine
marriage
so
that
although
it
happened
three
years
ago
trenchard
would
not
come
to
see
katherine
and
would
not
allow
katherine
to
come
and
see
her
then
there
was
henry
a
very
strange
young
man
he
was
at
cambridge
and
said
to
be
very
clever
he
did
indeed
seem
to
lead
a
mysterious
life
of
his
own
and
paid
very
little
attention
to
maggie
asking
her
once
whether
she
did
not
think
the
golden
ass
wonderful
and
what
did
she
think
of
petronius
and
when
maggie
laughed
and
said
that
she
was
glad
to
say
she
never
read
anything
he
left
her
in
an
agitated
horror
lady
rachel
seddon
was
very
grand
and
splendid
and
frightened
katherine
she
was
related
to
every
kind
of
duke
and
marquis
and
although
that
fact
did
not
impress
maggie
in
the
least
it
did
seem
to
remove
lady
rachel
into
quite
another
world
but
they
were
all
in
another
world
maggie
discovered
that
at
once
they
had
of
course
every
sort
of
and
allusion
and
joke
that
no
one
but
themselves
and
the
people
whom
they
brought
into
the
house
understood
katherine
was
kindness
itself
philip
too
he
seemed
to
maggie
a
weak
amiable
young
man
took
a
lot
of
trouble
about
her
but
they
did
not
belong
to
her
nor
she
to
them
and
why
should
they
said
maggie
to
herself
i
must
look
on
it
as
though
i
were
staying
at
a
delightful
hotel
and
were
going
on
with
my
journey
very
soon
there
was
somebody
however
who
did
not
belong
any
more
than
maggie
did
and
very
soon
he
became
maggie
constant
companion
this
was
the
rev
paul
trenchard
katherine
cousin
from
the
very
moment
months
ago
when
maggie
and
he
had
first
met
in
katherine
they
had
been
friends
he
had
liked
her
maggie
felt
at
once
she
on
her
side
was
attracted
by
a
certain
childlike
simplicity
and
innocence
this
very
quality
she
soon
saw
moved
the
others
philip
and
henry
and
trenchard
senior
to
derision
they
did
not
like
the
rev
paul
they
chaffed
him
and
he
was
very
easily
teased
because
he
was
not
clever
and
did
not
see
their
jokes
this
put
maggie
up
in
arms
in
his
defence
at
once
but
they
had
all
the
layman
distrust
of
a
parson
they
were
all
polite
to
him
of
course
and
maggie
discovered
that
in
this
world
politeness
was
of
the
very
first
importance
so
that
you
really
never
said
what
you
thought
nor
did
what
you
wanted
to
they
frankly
could
not
understand
why
katherine
asked
the
parson
to
stay
but
because
they
loved
katherine
they
were
as
nice
to
him
as
their
natures
would
allow
them
to
be
paul
did
not
apparently
notice
that
they
put
him
outside
their
life
he
was
always
genial
laughed
a
great
deal
when
there
was
no
reason
to
laugh
at
all
and
told
simple
little
stories
in
whose
effect
he
profoundly
believed
he
was
supported
in
his
confidence
by
his
sister
grace
who
obviously
adored
him
she
too
was
outside
the
family
but
she
seemed
to
be
quite
happy
telling
endless
stories
of
paul
courage
and
cleverness
and
popularity
she
did
indeed
believe
that
where
paul
had
his
living
was
the
hub
of
the
universe
and
this
amused
all
the
trenchard
family
very
much
indeed
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
paul
and
his
sister
were
treated
unkindly
they
were
shown
the
greatest
courtesy
and
hospitality
but
maggie
knew
that
that
was
only
because
it
was
the
trenchard
tradition
to
do
so
and
not
from
motives
of
affection
or
warmth
of
heart
they
could
be
it
was
wonderful
to
see
the
way
that
they
all
adored
katherine
and
they
had
many
friends
for
whom
they
would
do
anything
but
the
rev
paul
seemed
to
them
frankly
an
ass
and
they
would
be
glad
when
he
went
away
he
did
not
seem
to
maggie
an
ass
she
thought
him
the
kindest
person
she
had
ever
known
kinder
even
than
katherine
because
with
katherine
there
was
the
faintest
suspicion
of
patronage
no
not
of
patronage
that
was
unfair
but
of
an
effort
to
put
herself
in
exactly
maggie
place
so
that
she
might
understand
perfectly
what
were
maggie
motives
with
paul
trenchard
there
was
no
effort
no
deliberate
slipping
out
of
one
world
into
another
one
he
was
frankly
delighted
to
tell
maggie
everything
all
about
and
its
delights
about
the
church
and
its
marvellous
east
window
about
the
choir
and
the
difficulties
with
the
and
the
necessity
for
repairing
the
organ
about
the
troubles
with
the
churchwardens
especially
one
bellows
who
in
his
cantankerous
and
dyspeptic
objections
to
everything
that
any
one
proposed
became
quite
a
lively
figure
to
maggie
imagination
about
the
john
brotherhood
which
had
been
formed
to
keep
the
lads
out
of
the
and
was
doing
so
well
about
the
shakespeare
reading
society
and
a
tempest
who
also
became
a
live
figure
in
maggie
brain
a
born
tragedian
and
wonderful
as
lady
macbeth
and
katherine
of
aragon
skeaton
slowly
revealed
itself
to
maggie
as
a
sunny
sparkling
place
with
glittering
sea
shining
sand
and
dark
cool
woods
full
of
kindliness
too
and
friendship
and
paul
and
grace
trenchard
seemed
to
be
the
centre
of
this
sunshine
how
heartily
paul
laughed
as
he
recounted
some
of
the
tricks
and
escapades
of
his
young
scamps
dear
fellows
he
would
say
i
love
them
all
and
grace
sat
by
smiling
and
nodding
her
head
and
beaming
upon
her
beloved
brother
to
maggie
fresh
from
the
dark
and
confused
terrors
of
the
chapel
it
was
all
marvellous
here
was
rest
indeed
here
with
martin
cherished
warmly
in
her
heart
she
might
occupy
herself
with
duties
and
interests
here
surely
she
would
be
useful
to
somebody
she
heard
a
good
deal
of
an
old
toms
a
little
queer
in
his
head
poor
man
who
seemed
to
figure
in
the
outskirts
of
skeaton
society
as
a
warning
and
a
reassurance
no
one
in
skeaton
thinks
of
him
in
any
way
but
tenderly
maggie
wondered
whether
he
might
not
want
looking
after
the
thought
gradually
occurred
to
her
that
this
kindly
genial
clergyman
might
perhaps
find
her
some
work
in
skeaton
he
even
himself
hinted
at
something
she
might
be
some
one
secretary
or
housekeeper
about
grace
trenchard
maggie
was
not
quite
so
sure
she
was
kindness
itself
and
liked
to
hold
maggie
hand
and
pat
it
but
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
she
was
just
a
little
bit
tiresome
maggie
rebuked
herself
for
thinking
this
but
again
and
again
the
thought
arose
grace
was
in
a
state
of
perpetual
wonder
everything
amazed
her
you
would
not
think
to
look
at
her
flat
broad
placidity
that
she
was
a
creature
of
excitement
and
it
might
be
that
her
excitement
was
rather
superficial
she
would
say
why
just
fancy
maggie
tuesday
then
you
wondered
what
was
coming
next
and
nothing
came
at
all
she
had
endless
stories
about
her
adventures
in
the
streets
of
london
and
these
stories
were
endless
because
of
all
the
details
that
must
be
fitted
in
and
then
the
details
slipped
out
of
her
grasp
and
winked
at
her
maliciously
as
they
disappeared
the
fact
was
perhaps
that
she
was
not
very
clever
but
then
maggie
was
very
clever
either
so
she
had
no
right
to
criticise
miss
trenchard
who
was
really
as
amiable
as
she
could
be
henry
trenchard
said
once
to
maggie
in
his
usual
scornful
way
oh
grace
she
the
stupidest
woman
in
skeaton
which
means
the
stupidest
woman
in
the
world
the
trenchards
maggie
thought
were
rather
given
to
scorning
every
one
save
themselves
even
philip
who
was
not
a
trenchard
had
caught
the
habit
katherine
of
course
despised
no
one
and
liked
every
one
but
that
was
rather
tiresome
too
in
fact
at
the
end
of
her
first
week
maggie
thought
that
as
soon
as
possible
she
would
find
a
room
for
herself
somewhere
and
start
to
earn
her
living
she
discovered
that
she
was
developing
a
new
sensitiveness
when
she
was
living
with
the
aunts
she
had
not
minded
very
seriously
the
criticisms
made
upon
her
she
had
indeed
been
disappointed
when
aunt
anne
had
not
admired
her
new
dress
and
she
had
hated
amy
warlock
rudeness
but
that
was
because
martin
had
been
involved
this
new
sensitiveness
worried
her
she
hated
to
care
whether
people
laughed
at
the
way
she
came
into
a
room
or
whether
she
expressed
foolish
opinions
about
books
and
pictures
she
had
always
said
just
what
she
thought
but
now
before
philip
kindly
attention
and
trenchard
senior
indulgence
he
wrote
books
and
articles
in
the
papers
she
hated
her
ignorance
paul
trenchard
knew
frankly
nothing
about
art
i
know
what
i
like
he
said
and
that
enough
for
me
he
liked
watts
pictures
and
in
memoriam
and
dickens
and
he
heard
the
messiah
once
a
year
in
london
if
he
could
leave
his
parish
work
he
laughed
about
it
all
the
souls
of
men
the
souls
of
men
he
would
say
that
is
what
i
after
miss
cardinal
you
not
going
to
catch
them
with
the
latest
neurotic
novel
however
well
it
written
oh
he
was
kind
to
her
he
was
kinder
and
kinder
and
kinder
she
told
him
everything
except
about
martin
she
told
him
all
about
her
life
at
dreot
and
her
father
and
uncle
mathew
the
aunts
and
the
chapel
he
was
frankly
shocked
by
the
chapel
that
not
the
way
to
get
into
heaven
he
said
we
must
be
more
patient
than
that
the
daily
round
the
daily
task
that
the
kind
his
physical
presence
began
to
pervade
all
her
doings
he
was
not
handsome
but
so
clean
so
rosy
and
so
strong
no
mystery
about
him
no
terrors
no
invasions
from
the
devil
everything
was
clear
and
certain
he
knew
just
where
he
was
and
exactly
whither
he
was
going
one
afternoon
when
they
were
out
in
the
motor
together
he
took
maggie
hand
under
the
rug
and
he
held
it
so
calmly
so
firmly
with
so
kindly
a
benevolence
that
she
could
not
be
frightened
or
uncomfortable
he
was
like
a
large
friendly
brother
one
day
he
called
her
maggie
he
blushed
and
laughed
i
so
sorry
he
said
it
slipped
out
i
caught
it
from
katherine
oh
please
never
mind
she
answered
miss
cardinal
so
stiff
then
you
must
call
me
paul
he
said
a
little
conversation
that
maggie
had
after
this
with
millicent
showed
her
in
sharp
relief
exactly
where
she
stood
in
relation
to
the
trenchard
family
they
had
been
out
in
the
motor
together
millie
had
been
shopping
and
now
they
were
rolling
back
through
the
park
are
you
happy
with
us
maggie
millicent
suddenly
asked
very
happy
maggie
answered
well
i
hope
you
are
said
millicent
i
do
think
that
as
a
family
we
very
good
at
making
any
one
happy
except
ourselves
i
think
very
selfish
no
i
do
think
you
selfish
said
maggie
but
i
think
sufficient
for
yourselves
i
do
fancy
you
really
want
any
one
from
outside
no
i
do
think
the
others
do
i
do
though
you
do
suppose
going
to
stay
in
the
trenchard
bosom
for
ever
do
you
i
not
i
assure
you
but
what
you
said
means
that
you
do
really
feel
at
home
with
us
i
do
think
i
want
to
feel
at
home
with
you
maggie
answered
i
do
belong
to
any
of
you
contrast
us
for
instance
you
got
everything
good
looks
money
cleverness
position
you
can
get
what
you
like
out
of
life
i
got
nothing
i
plain
poor
awkward
uneducated
and
yet
you
know
i
would
change
places
with
any
one
rather
be
myself
than
any
one
alive
yes
you
would
said
millicent
nodding
her
head
that
you
all
over
i
felt
it
the
moment
you
came
into
the
house
you
adventurous
we
not
katherine
was
adventurous
for
a
moment
when
she
married
philip
but
she
soon
slipped
back
again
but
you
do
just
what
you
want
to
always
i
shall
have
to
said
maggie
laughing
there
no
one
else
to
do
it
for
me
it
is
only
that
i
do
belong
to
you
i
never
belonged
to
any
one
only
one
person
and
he
gone
now
i
belong
to
him
and
he
never
come
back
were
you
frightfully
in
love
asked
millie
deeply
interested
yes
said
maggie
he
ought
to
have
gone
away
like
that
said
millicent
yes
he
ought
said
maggie
he
was
quite
right
but
do
bother
about
that
i
got
to
find
some
place
now
where
i
can
work
the
worst
of
it
is
i
so
ignorant
but
there
must
be
something
that
i
ran
do
there
paul
said
millie
what
do
you
mean
asked
maggie
oh
he
cares
like
anything
for
you
you
must
have
noticed
it
began
after
the
first
time
he
met
you
he
was
always
asking
about
you
of
course
every
one
noticed
it
cares
for
me
maggie
repeated
yes
of
course
he
wanted
to
marry
for
a
long
time
tired
of
grace
bossing
him
i
expect
that
does
sound
very
polite
to
you
but
i
know
that
he
cares
for
you
apart
from
that
for
yourself
i
mean
and
i
expect
grace
is
tired
of
housekeeping
maggie
feelings
were
very
strange
why
should
he
care
about
her
did
she
want
him
to
care
a
strange
friendly
feeling
stole
about
her
heart
she
was
not
alone
then
after
all
some
one
wanted
her
wanted
her
so
obviously
that
every
one
had
noticed
it
did
not
want
her
as
martin
had
wanted
her
against
his
own
will
and
judgment
if
he
did
offer
her
his
home
what
would
she
feel
there
was
rest
there
rest
and
a
real
home
a
home
that
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
known
of
course
she
did
not
love
him
in
the
least
his
approach
did
not
make
her
pulses
beat
a
moment
faster
she
did
not
long
for
him
to
come
when
he
was
not
there
but
he
wanted
her
that
was
the
great
thing
he
wanted
her
of
course
if
he
asked
you
you
would
really
think
of
marrying
him
said
millicent
i
do
know
said
maggie
slowly
what
marry
him
and
live
in
skeaton
millicent
was
frankly
amazed
why
skeaton
awful
and
the
people
in
it
are
awful
and
grace
is
awful
in
the
summer
it
all
and
and
in
the
winter
there
is
a
soul
millicent
shivered
maggie
smiled
of
course
it
seems
dull
to
you
but
my
life
been
very
different
it
has
been
very
exciting
and
if
i
could
really
help
him
she
broke
off
i
do
like
him
she
said
he
the
kindest
man
i
ever
met
of
course
he
seems
dull
to
you
who
have
met
all
kinds
of
brilliant
people
i
hate
brilliant
people
the
car
was
in
bryanston
square
just
before
it
stopped
millie
bent
over
and
kissed
maggie
i
think
you
a
darling
she
said
but
millie
did
think
maggie
a
darling
for
long
that
is
she
did
not
think
about
her
at
all
for
long
none
of
the
family
did
so
quiet
was
maggie
so
little
in
any
one
way
that
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
she
made
no
difference
to
any
one
in
the
house
she
was
much
better
now
looking
a
different
person
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
light
in
her
eyes
during
her
illness
they
had
cut
her
hair
and
this
made
her
look
more
than
ever
like
a
boy
she
wore
her
plain
dark
dresses
black
and
dark
blue
they
never
quite
fitted
and
with
her
queer
odd
face
her
high
forehead
rather
awkward
mouth
and
grave
questioning
eyes
she
gave
you
the
impression
that
she
had
been
hurried
into
some
disguise
and
was
wearing
it
with
discomfort
but
amusement
some
one
who
met
her
at
the
trenchards
at
this
time
said
of
her
what
a
funny
girl
like
a
schoolboy
dressed
up
to
play
a
part
in
the
school
speeches
of
course
she
was
not
playing
a
part
no
one
could
have
been
more
entirely
natural
and
honest
but
she
was
odd
strange
out
of
her
own
world
and
every
one
felt
it
it
was
perhaps
this
strangeness
that
attracted
paul
trenchard
he
was
above
everything
a
kindly
perhaps
a
little
through
laziness
but
nevertheless
moved
always
by
distress
or
misfortune
in
others
maggie
was
not
distressed
she
was
quite
cheerful
and
entirely
unsentimental
nevertheless
she
had
been
very
ill
was
almost
penniless
had
had
some
private
trouble
was
an
orphan
had
no
friends
save
two
old
aunts
and
was
amazingly
ignorant
of
the
world
this
last
was
perhaps
the
thing
that
struck
him
most
of
all
he
too
was
ignorant
of
the
world
but
he
did
know
that
and
he
was
amazed
at
the
things
that
maggie
brushed
aside
as
unimportant
he
found
that
he
was
beginning
to
think
of
her
as
my
little
heathen
his
attitude
was
the
same
as
that
of
a
good
missionary
discovering
a
naked
but
trusting
native
the
thought
of
training
this
virgin
mind
was
delightful
to
him
he
liked
her
quaintness
and
one
day
suddenly
to
his
own
surprise
when
they
were
alone
in
the
he
kissed
her
a
most
chaste
kiss
gently
on
the
forehead
oh
my
dear
child
he
said
in
a
kind
of
dismay
she
looked
up
at
him
with
complete
confidence
so
gentle
a
kiss
had
it
been
that
it
had
been
no
more
than
a
pressure
of
the
hand
a
few
days
later
katherine
spoke
to
her
she
came
up
to
her
bedroom
just
as
maggie
was
beginning
to
undress
maggie
stood
in
front
of
the
glass
her
evening
frock
off
brushing
her
short
thick
hair
before
the
glass
have
you
made
any
plans
yet
dear
asked
katherine
maggie
shook
her
head
no
she
said
not
yet
katherine
hesitated
i
got
a
confession
to
make
she
said
at
last
maggie
turned
to
look
at
her
with
her
large
childish
eyes
oh
i
do
hope
you
done
something
wrong
she
said
laughing
something
really
bad
that
i
should
have
to
what
do
you
mean
asked
katherine
maggie
only
said
we
be
more
on
a
level
then
i
do
think
it
anything
very
bad
but
the
truth
is
maggie
that
i
did
ask
you
here
only
for
my
own
pleasure
and
to
make
you
well
there
was
a
third
reason
i
know
said
maggie
paul
my
dear
said
katherine
amazed
how
did
you
guess
i
never
should
have
done
paul
asked
you
to
find
out
whether
i
like
him
said
maggie
yes
said
katherine
well
i
do
like
him
said
maggie
do
think
that
i
been
unfair
said
katherine
they
were
sitting
now
side
by
side
on
maggie
bed
and
katherine
hand
was
on
knee
i
tell
you
exactly
how
it
happened
paul
was
interested
in
you
from
the
moment
that
he
saw
you
at
my
house
ever
so
long
ago
he
asked
ever
so
many
questions
about
you
and
the
next
time
he
stayed
he
wanted
me
to
write
and
ask
you
to
come
and
stay
well
i
did
i
knew
from
what
you
told
me
that
you
cared
for
somebody
else
and
i
want
to
get
paul
really
fond
of
you
if
it
was
going
to
be
no
good
you
see
i
known
paul
for
ages
he
nearly
ten
years
older
than
i
but
he
used
to
come
and
stay
with
us
at
garth
when
he
was
at
cambridge
and
before
he
was
a
clergyman
i
very
fond
of
him
i
know
the
others
think
he
stupid
simply
because
he
does
know
the
things
that
they
do
but
he
good
and
kind
and
honest
and
just
exactly
what
he
seems
to
be
i
like
him
repeated
maggie
nodding
her
head
he
been
wanting
to
be
married
went
on
katherine
for
some
time
i
going
to
tell
you
everything
so
that
i
shall
have
been
perfectly
fair
grace
wants
him
to
be
married
too
all
her
life
she
looked
after
him
and
he
always
done
exactly
what
she
told
him
he
rather
lazy
and
it
not
hard
for
some
one
to
get
an
influence
over
him
well
she
not
really
a
very
good
manager
she
thinks
she
is
but
she
is
she
arranges
things
and
wants
things
to
stay
just
where
she
puts
them
but
she
arranges
all
the
wrong
unnecessary
things
still
it
easy
to
criticise
and
i
not
a
very
good
manager
myself
i
think
growing
rather
tired
of
it
and
would
like
some
one
to
take
it
off
her
hands
of
course
paul
must
marry
the
right
person
some
one
whom
she
can
control
and
manage
and
some
one
who
wo
transplant
her
in
affection
that
her
idea
but
it
all
nonsense
of
course
you
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
she
simply
does
understand
what
marriage
is
like
when
paul
marries
she
learn
more
about
life
in
a
month
than
she
learnt
in
all
her
days
well
maggie
dear
she
thinks
just
the
girl
for
paul
she
thinks
she
can
do
what
she
likes
with
you
she
thinks
you
nice
of
course
but
she
going
to
you
and
you
you
need
worry
about
that
you
need
really
if
you
care
about
paul
you
manage
both
of
them
in
a
week
but
there
it
is
i
thought
i
ought
to
warn
you
about
grace
as
to
paul
i
believe
you
be
happy
you
have
your
home
and
your
life
and
your
friends
skeaton
is
so
bad
if
you
live
in
it
i
believe
and
paul
could
get
another
living
if
you
were
happy
there
did
katherine
have
any
scruples
as
she
pursued
her
argument
a
real
glance
at
maggie
confiding
trustful
gaze
might
have
shaken
her
resolve
this
child
who
knew
so
little
about
anything
was
skeaton
the
world
for
her
but
katherine
had
so
many
philanthropies
that
she
was
given
to
finishing
one
off
a
little
abruptly
in
order
to
make
ready
for
the
next
one
she
was
interested
just
now
in
a
scheme
for
adopting
illegitimate
babies
she
thought
maggie
an
angel
and
she
just
longed
for
her
to
be
happy
nevertheless
maggie
was
very
ignorant
and
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
see
what
trade
or
occupation
she
would
be
able
to
adopt
she
was
nearly
well
now
and
katherine
did
not
know
quite
what
to
do
with
her
here
was
an
admirable
marriage
something
that
would
give
a
home
and
children
and
friends
what
could
be
better
she
had
just
passed
apparently
through
a
love
affair
that
could
have
led
to
no
possible
good
solve
the
difficulty
make
maggie
safe
for
life
and
pass
on
to
the
illegitimate
babies
of
course
i
do
love
him
said
maggie
staring
in
front
of
her
but
you
like
him
said
katherine
it
is
as
though
paul
were
a
very
young
man
he
would
expect
anything
very
romantic
he
really
a
romantic
man
himself
and
i
shall
always
love
martin
pursued
maggie
katherine
own
romance
had
fulfilled
itself
so
thoroughly
that
it
had
almost
ceased
to
be
romantic
the
trenchard
blood
in
her
made
her
a
little
impatient
of
unfulfilled
romances
do
you
think
maggie
dear
she
said
gently
that
it
would
be
better
to
forget
him
no
i
do
said
maggie
moving
away
from
katherine
and
i
should
have
to
tell
paul
about
him
i
tell
paul
the
exact
truth
that
if
i
married
him
it
was
because
i
liked
him
and
i
thought
we
be
good
friends
i
see
quite
clearly
that
i
ca
sit
for
ever
waiting
for
martin
to
come
back
and
the
sooner
i
settle
to
something
the
better
if
paul
wants
a
friend
i
can
be
one
but
i
should
never
love
him
even
though
martin
was
there
and
as
to
the
managing
i
dreadfully
careless
and
forgetful
you
soon
learn
said
katherine
do
you
think
i
should
asked
maggie
i
do
know
i
sure
as
to
grace
i
think
we
get
on
all
right
there
a
greater
difficulty
than
that
though
what
asked
katherine
as
maggie
hesitated
religion
said
maggie
paul
a
clergyman
and
i
do
believe
in
his
religion
at
all
two
months
ago
i
have
said
i
hated
all
religion
and
so
would
you
if
you
had
a
time
like
me
but
since
martin
gone
not
so
sure
there
i
want
to
find
out
but
paul
found
out
everything
he
quite
sure
and
certain
i
have
to
tell
him
i
do
believe
in
any
of
his
faith
tell
him
of
course
said
katherine
i
think
he
knows
that
already
he
going
to
convert
you
he
looks
forward
to
it
if
he
had
been
so
lazy
he
have
been
a
missionary
tell
me
about
skeaton
said
maggie
i
only
been
there
once
said
katherine
frankly
i
did
like
it
very
much
but
then
i
so
used
to
the
glebeshire
sea
that
it
all
seemed
rather
tame
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sand
blowing
about
the
day
i
was
there
but
paul
house
is
nice
with
a
garden
and
a
and
and
oh
very
nice
and
nice
people
next
door
i
believe
i
glad
it
not
like
glebeshire
said
maggie
that
a
point
in
its
favour
i
want
to
be
somewhere
where
everything
is
quiet
and
orderly
and
every
one
knows
their
own
mind
and
all
the
bells
ring
at
the
right
time
and
no
one
strange
or
queer
and
most
of
all
where
no
one
afraid
of
anything
all
my
life
i
been
with
people
who
were
afraid
and
i
been
afraid
myself
now
paul
and
grace
are
not
afraid
of
anything
no
they
not
said
katherine
laughing
suddenly
maggie
broke
out
katherine
tell
me
truly
does
paul
want
me
does
he
need
me
does
he
indeed
the
storm
of
appeal
in
maggie
voice
made
katherine
suddenly
shy
there
was
a
hint
at
loneliness
and
desolation
there
that
was
something
beyond
her
reach
she
wanted
to
help
she
was
suddenly
frightened
at
her
urging
of
paul
suit
something
seemed
to
say
to
her
leave
this
alone
do
take
the
responsibility
of
this
you
do
understand
but
another
voice
said
poor
child
all
alone
penniless
without
a
friend
what
a
chance
for
her
paul
such
a
kind
man
so
she
kissed
maggie
and
said
he
wants
you
dreadfully
maggie
dear
maggie
cheeks
flushed
that
nice
she
said
in
her
most
ordinary
voice
because
no
one
ever
has
before
you
know
paul
proposal
came
the
very
next
day
it
came
after
luncheon
in
a
corner
of
the
maggie
knew
quite
well
that
it
was
coming
she
was
lying
in
a
long
chair
near
the
fire
a
shawl
over
her
knees
it
was
a
blustering
day
at
the
end
of
february
the
windows
rattled
and
the
wind
rushing
down
the
chimney
blew
the
flame
into
little
flags
and
pennants
of
colour
paul
came
and
stood
by
the
fire
warming
his
hands
his
legs
spread
out
maggie
looked
at
him
with
a
long
comprehensive
glance
that
took
him
in
from
head
to
foot
she
seemed
to
know
then
that
she
was
going
to
marry
him
a
voice
seemed
to
say
to
her
look
at
him
well
this
is
the
man
you
going
to
live
with
you
better
realise
him
she
did
realise
him
his
white
hair
his
rosy
cheeks
his
boyish
nose
and
mouth
and
rounded
chin
his
broad
chest
thick
long
legs
and
large
white
hands
soft
perhaps
but
warm
and
comfortable
and
safe
maggie
could
think
of
little
else
as
she
looked
at
him
but
of
how
nice
it
would
be
to
lay
her
head
back
on
that
broad
chest
feel
his
arms
around
her
and
forget
forget
forget
that
was
what
she
needed
forgetfulness
and
work
she
did
not
love
him
no
not
one
little
atom
she
had
never
felt
less
excitement
about
anybody
but
she
liked
him
respected
him
and
trusted
him
and
he
wanted
her
wanted
her
desperately
katherine
had
said
that
was
the
chief
thing
of
all
maggie
he
said
suddenly
turning
round
to
her
would
you
ever
think
of
marrying
me
she
liked
that
directness
and
simplicity
characteristic
of
him
she
looked
up
at
him
i
do
think
i
be
much
of
a
success
paul
she
said
he
saw
at
once
from
that
that
she
did
not
intend
instantly
to
refuse
him
his
rosy
cheeks
took
on
an
added
tinge
of
colour
and
he
caught
a
chair
drew
it
up
to
her
long
one
and
sat
down
bending
eagerly
towards
her
leave
that
to
me
he
said
i
ought
to
think
of
it
she
answered
shaking
her
head
and
for
very
good
reasons
for
one
thing
i
not
in
love
with
you
for
another
i
not
religious
and
for
a
third
i
so
careless
that
i
never
do
for
your
wife
of
course
i
knew
about
the
first
he
said
eagerly
i
knew
you
love
me
but
that
will
come
maggie
it
must
come
maggie
shook
her
head
i
love
some
one
else
she
said
and
i
always
will
but
he
gone
away
and
will
never
come
back
i
made
up
my
mind
to
that
but
if
he
did
come
back
and
wanted
me
i
could
promise
that
i
would
she
broke
off
you
can
see
that
it
would
do
no
i
ca
see
he
said
taking
her
hand
i
can
see
that
you
like
me
maggie
i
can
see
that
we
splendid
friends
if
your
other
friend
has
left
you
altogether
then
well
time
makes
a
great
difference
in
those
things
i
think
after
we
been
together
a
little
oh
maggie
do
he
broke
off
just
like
a
boy
do
we
suit
each
other
so
well
that
we
must
be
happy
and
then
grace
likes
you
she
likes
you
very
much
she
does
indeed
let
leave
grace
out
of
this
maggie
said
firmly
it
between
you
and
me
paul
it
nobody
else
affair
what
about
the
other
two
objections
i
do
believe
in
your
faith
at
all
and
i
unpunctual
and
forgetful
and
break
things
strangely
she
was
wanting
him
urgently
now
to
reassure
her
she
realised
that
if
now
he
withdrew
she
would
be
faced
with
a
loneliness
more
terrible
than
anything
that
she
had
known
since
martin
had
left
her
the
warm
pressure
of
his
hand
about
hers
reassured
her
maggie
dear
he
said
softly
i
love
you
better
because
you
young
and
unformed
i
can
help
you
dear
and
you
can
help
me
of
course
a
dreadful
old
buffer
in
many
ways
i
forty
you
know
and
such
a
child
how
old
are
you
maggie
twenty
she
said
twenty
fancy
and
you
can
like
an
old
parson
well
well
if
you
care
for
me
nothing
else
matters
god
will
see
to
the
rest
i
do
like
leaving
things
to
other
people
maggie
said
slowly
now
i
suppose
i
shocked
you
but
there
you
are
i
shall
always
be
shocking
you
nothing
that
you
can
say
will
shock
me
he
answered
firmly
do
you
know
that
that
part
of
the
charm
you
have
for
me
you
dear
little
wild
thing
if
you
will
come
and
live
with
me
perhaps
you
will
see
how
god
works
how
mysterious
are
his
ways
and
what
he
means
to
do
for
you
maggie
shivered
oh
now
you
talking
like
aunt
anne
i
do
want
to
feel
that
i
something
that
some
one
can
do
what
he
likes
with
not
no
i
know
you
not
paul
answered
eagerly
you
very
independent
i
admire
that
in
you
and
so
does
grace
would
grace
like
us
to
marry
asked
maggie
it
the
desire
of
her
heart
said
paul
but
how
can
you
want
to
marry
me
when
you
know
i
do
love
you
love
a
strange
thing
companionship
can
make
great
changes
you
like
me
that
is
enough
for
the
present
i
can
be
patient
i
not
an
impetuous
man
he
was
certainly
not
he
was
just
a
large
warm
comfortable
creature
far
far
from
the
terrified
and
strangely
travelled
soul
of
martin
insensibly
hardly
realising
what
she
did
maggie
was
drawn
towards
paul
he
drew
close
to
her
moved
on
to
the
sofa
and
then
with
one
arm
about
her
let
her
head
rest
against
his
chest
maggie
could
neither
move
nor
speak
she
only
felt
a
warm
comfort
an
intense
desire
for
rest
very
very
gently
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
forehead
the
clock
ticked
on
the
flames
of
the
fire
spurted
and
fell
maggie
eyes
closed
she
gave
a
little
sigh
and
soon
her
cheek
against
his
waistcoat
like
a
little
child
was
fast
asleep
the
engagement
was
a
settled
thing
every
one
in
the
house
was
relieved
maggie
herself
felt
as
though
she
had
found
lights
and
safety
running
from
a
wood
full
of
loneliness
and
terror
she
was
sharp
enough
to
see
how
relieved
they
all
were
that
she
was
they
were
true
kindly
people
and
now
they
were
more
kind
to
her
than
ever
that
showed
that
they
had
been
uneasy
about
her
she
was
their
hands
now
maggie
when
she
saw
this
in
the
faces
of
philip
and
trenchard
and
even
of
millicent
was
glad
that
she
was
engaged
she
was
now
she
had
friends
and
a
home
and
work
now
and
she
would
banish
all
that
other
world
for
ever
for
ever
how
curious
it
was
that
from
the
moment
of
her
engagement
her
aunts
their
house
the
chapel
and
the
people
around
it
began
to
press
upon
her
attention
with
a
pathos
and
sentiment
that
she
had
never
felt
before
she
went
to
see
the
aunts
of
course
and
sat
in
the
old
for
and
they
were
kind
and
distant
they
were
glad
that
she
was
to
be
married
they
hoped
that
she
would
be
happy
aunt
anne
looked
very
ill
and
there
was
a
terrible
air
of
desertion
about
the
house
as
though
all
the
life
had
gone
out
of
it
maggie
came
away
very
miserable
then
she
said
to
herself
now
look
here
you
in
a
new
house
now
you
got
to
think
of
nothing
but
that
nothing
nothing
nothing
she
meant
martin
she
might
think
of
martin
how
indeed
could
she
help
it
but
she
was
not
to
long
for
him
no
no
not
to
long
for
him
she
did
wish
that
she
could
go
to
sleep
more
quickly
when
she
went
to
bed
paul
and
grace
were
very
kind
to
her
paul
was
just
the
big
elder
brother
that
she
loved
him
to
be
no
more
sentiment
than
that
a
kiss
morning
a
kiss
evening
that
was
all
grace
behaved
to
them
both
with
a
motherly
indulgence
maggie
saw
that
she
considered
that
she
had
arranged
the
whole
affair
there
were
signs
that
she
intended
to
arrange
everything
for
maggie
well
it
was
rather
pleasant
just
now
to
have
things
arranged
for
you
maggie
had
only
one
wish
that
grace
would
not
take
so
long
to
explain
everything
maggie
always
ran
ahead
of
her
long
before
she
had
finished
her
involved
sentences
and
then
had
to
curb
her
impatience
however
one
would
get
used
to
grace
one
would
have
to
because
she
was
going
to
live
with
them
after
they
were
married
maggie
had
hoped
that
it
would
be
otherwise
but
it
was
at
once
obvious
that
neither
paul
nor
grace
dreamt
of
being
separated
the
wedding
was
to
be
as
soon
as
possible
and
very
very
quiet
in
a
little
church
close
by
no
bridesmaids
everything
very
simple
maggie
was
glad
of
that
she
would
have
hated
a
church
full
of
staring
people
she
enjoyed
immensely
buying
her
trousseau
paul
was
very
generous
with
his
money
it
was
evident
that
grace
thought
him
too
generous
maggie
and
katherine
went
together
to
buy
things
and
katherine
was
a
darling
maggie
fancied
that
katherine
was
not
quite
easy
in
her
mind
about
her
share
in
the
affair
you
wo
expect
skeaton
to
be
wildly
exciting
maggie
dear
will
you
she
said
you
find
plenty
to
do
and
there
are
lots
of
nice
people
i
sure
and
you
come
up
and
stay
with
us
here
i
think
it
sounds
delightful
said
maggie
if
you
lived
for
years
in
dreot
katherine
you
would
talk
about
other
places
being
dull
it
is
excitement
i
want
it
work
do
you
let
grace
bully
you
said
katherine
bully
me
grace
maggie
was
very
astonished
why
she
the
kindest
old
thing
she
wants
me
to
do
everything
so
she
says
said
katherine
doubtfully
but
she
very
jealous
of
paul
how
much
she
really
like
giving
up
her
authority
when
it
comes
to
the
point
i
do
know
you
stick
up
to
her
paul
weak
i
do
think
he
is
said
maggie
rather
indignantly
grace
always
does
what
he
says
yes
just
now
said
katherine
and
maggie
had
one
funny
little
conversation
with
henry
trenchard
that
wild
youth
catching
her
alone
one
day
said
abruptly
what
the
devil
have
you
done
it
for
done
what
asked
maggie
her
heart
beating
a
little
faster
strangely
henry
reminded
her
of
martin
he
alone
of
all
the
trenchards
had
something
that
was
of
that
other
world
engaged
yourself
to
paul
said
henry
why
should
i
asked
maggie
you
do
love
him
of
course
you
could
you
not
his
sort
in
the
least
you
worth
a
million
pauls
this
was
so
odd
for
henry
who
was
certainly
not
given
to
compliments
that
maggie
burst
out
laughing
yes
you
may
laugh
said
henry
i
know
what
i
talking
about
have
you
ever
seen
paul
asleep
after
dinner
no
said
maggie
i
wish
you
had
that
might
have
saved
you
have
you
ever
seen
grace
lose
her
temper
no
said
maggie
this
time
a
little
uneasily
look
here
he
came
close
to
her
staring
at
her
with
those
eyes
of
his
that
could
be
very
charming
when
he
liked
break
it
off
say
you
think
it
a
mistake
you
be
miserable
indeed
i
sha
said
maggie
tossing
her
head
whatever
happens
not
going
to
be
miserable
no
one
can
make
me
that
so
you
think
henry
frowned
i
ca
think
what
you
want
to
be
married
for
at
all
these
days
women
can
have
such
a
good
time
especially
a
woman
with
character
like
you
if
i
were
a
woman
i
never
marry
you
do
understand
said
maggie
you
have
been
lonely
all
your
life
as
i
have
and
you
not
afraid
of
making
yourself
cheap
and
and
looking
for
some
one
who
does
want
you
it
so
easy
for
you
to
talk
and
paul
wants
me
really
he
does
yes
he
does
said
henry
slowly
he
in
love
with
you
all
right
i
as
sorry
for
paul
as
i
am
for
you
maggie
laughed
it
very
kind
of
you
to
be
sorry
she
said
but
you
need
trouble
i
believe
we
can
look
after
ourselves
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
this
conversation
she
was
a
little
uneasy
he
was
a
clever
boy
henry
he
did
watch
people
but
then
he
was
very
young
it
was
all
guesswork
with
him
she
became
now
strangely
quiescent
her
energy
her
individuality
her
strength
of
will
seemed
for
the
time
entirely
to
have
gone
she
surrendered
herself
to
grace
and
paul
and
katherine
and
they
did
what
they
would
with
her
only
once
was
she
disturbed
two
nights
before
the
wedding
she
dreamt
of
martin
it
did
not
appear
as
a
dream
at
all
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
asleep
and
that
she
suddenly
woke
she
was
gazing
from
her
bed
into
her
own
room
but
at
the
farther
end
of
it
instead
of
the
wall
with
the
rosy
trees
and
the
gold
mirror
was
another
room
this
room
was
strange
and
cheerless
with
bare
boards
a
large
bed
with
faded
blue
hangings
two
old
black
prints
with
figures
and
a
big
standing
mirror
in
front
of
the
bed
staring
into
the
mirror
was
martin
he
was
dressed
shabbily
in
a
blue
reefer
coat
he
looked
older
than
when
she
had
seen
him
last
was
stouter
and
ill
with
white
puffy
cheeks
and
dark
shadows
under
his
eyes
she
saw
him
very
clearly
under
the
light
of
two
candles
that
wavered
a
little
in
the
draught
he
was
staring
into
the
mirror
absorbed
apparently
in
what
he
saw
there
she
cried
his
name
and
he
seemed
to
start
and
turn
towards
the
door
listening
then
the
picture
faded
she
woke
to
find
herself
sitting
up
in
bed
crying
his
name
in
the
morning
she
drove
this
dream
away
from
her
refusing
to
think
of
it
or
listen
to
it
but
somewhere
far
down
in
her
soul
something
trembled
the
wedding
was
over
so
quickly
that
she
scarcely
realised
it
there
was
the
stuffy
little
church
very
empty
and
dusty
with
brass
plates
on
the
wall
she
could
hear
in
the
street
rumblings
of
carts
and
the
rattle
of
wheels
somewhere
a
played
the
clergyman
was
a
little
man
who
smiled
upon
her
kindly
when
paul
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
she
started
as
though
for
a
moment
she
awoke
from
a
dream
she
was
glad
that
he
looked
so
clean
and
tidy
grace
was
wearing
too
grand
a
hat
with
black
feathers
in
the
vestry
paul
kissed
her
and
then
they
walked
down
the
aisle
together
she
saw
katherine
and
millie
and
henry
her
fingers
caught
tightly
about
paul
stout
arm
but
she
would
have
been
more
at
home
she
thought
with
uncle
mathew
just
then
it
was
a
nice
bright
spring
day
although
the
wind
blew
the
dust
about
they
had
a
meal
in
katherine
house
and
some
one
made
a
speech
and
maggie
drank
some
champagne
she
hoped
she
looked
nice
in
her
grey
silk
dress
and
then
caught
sight
of
herself
in
a
glass
and
thought
she
was
as
ever
a
fright
my
little
wild
thing
mine
now
whispered
paul
she
thought
that
rather
silly
she
was
not
a
wild
thing
but
simply
maggie
cardinal
oh
no
maggie
trenchard
she
did
not
feel
maggie
trenchard
at
all
and
she
did
not
suppose
that
she
ever
would
they
were
to
have
a
fortnight
alone
at
skeaton
before
grace
came
maggie
was
glad
of
that
paul
was
really
nicer
when
grace
was
not
there
they
were
all
very
kind
to
her
they
had
given
her
good
presents
millie
some
silver
brushes
henry
some
books
philip
a
fan
and
katherine
a
most
beautiful
maggie
had
never
had
such
things
before
but
she
could
have
wished
for
something
from
her
own
people
she
had
written
to
uncle
mathew
but
had
not
heard
from
him
at
the
very
last
moment
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
day
a
present
came
from
the
aunts
an
old
box
for
handkerchiefs
the
cover
was
inlaid
with
and
there
was
a
little
inside
very
soon
it
was
all
over
and
then
to
her
own
intense
surprise
she
was
alone
in
the
train
with
paul
what
had
she
expected
she
did
not
know
but
somehow
not
this
they
were
in
a
carriage
paul
was
doing
the
thing
nobly
he
sat
close
to
her
his
broad
knee
against
her
dress
how
broad
his
knee
was
a
great
expanse
of
black
shining
cloth
he
took
her
hand
and
rested
it
on
the
expanse
and
at
the
touch
of
the
stuff
and
the
throb
of
the
warm
flesh
beneath
it
she
shivered
a
little
and
would
wish
to
have
drawn
her
hand
away
he
seemed
so
much
larger
than
she
had
expected
from
his
knee
to
his
high
shining
white
collar
was
an
immense
distance
and
midway
there
was
a
thick
gold
rising
and
falling
as
he
breathed
he
smelt
very
faintly
of
but
on
the
whole
she
was
comfortable
only
the
thin
gold
ring
round
her
finger
felt
strange
deep
in
a
little
pocket
inside
her
blouse
was
the
ring
with
the
three
little
pearls
i
do
hope
maggie
darling
he
said
you
do
think
it
strange
our
not
going
somewhere
else
for
our
honeymoon
my
lads
will
be
expecting
me
back
i
was
kept
longer
in
london
than
i
should
have
been
by
you
you
little
witch
my
witch
now
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
urged
her
head
towards
his
coat
but
her
hat
her
beautiful
hat
that
had
cost
so
much
more
than
she
had
ever
spent
on
a
hat
before
was
in
the
way
it
struck
into
his
chin
they
were
both
uncomfortable
and
then
thank
heaven
the
train
slowed
down
they
were
at
a
station
and
some
one
got
into
their
carriage
a
stout
man
all
newspaper
and
creases
to
his
trousers
that
in
the
circumstances
was
a
great
relief
and
soon
maggie
dozed
seeing
the
telegraph
wires
and
the
trees
like
waving
hands
through
a
mist
of
sleep
as
she
fell
asleep
she
realised
that
this
was
only
the
second
time
in
all
her
life
that
she
had
been
in
a
train
some
one
bawled
in
her
car
skeaton
skeaton
and
she
looked
up
to
find
a
porter
gazing
at
her
through
the
window
she
was
on
a
platform
her
husband
arm
was
through
hers
she
was
being
helped
into
an
old
faded
cab
now
they
were
driving
down
a
hill
under
a
along
a
road
with
villas
and
trees
trees
and
villas
and
then
villas
alone
what
a
wind
the
bare
branches
were
in
a
frenzy
and
from
almost
every
villa
blew
little
pennons
of
white
curtains
they
like
to
have
their
windows
open
any
way
she
thought
paul
said
very
little
he
was
obviously
nervous
of
how
she
would
take
it
all
she
took
it
all
very
well
what
pretty
houses
she
said
and
here
are
the
shops
only
a
few
a
a
grocer
a
stationer
with
library
on
the
door
a
the
suburbs
said
paul
what
a
wind
it
rolled
up
the
road
like
a
leaping
carpet
you
could
almost
see
its
folds
and
creases
no
one
about
not
a
living
soul
the
cab
i
ordered
never
came
lucky
thing
there
was
one
there
said
paul
not
a
soul
about
does
any
one
live
here
she
could
not
see
much
through
the
window
and
she
could
hear
nothing
because
the
glass
rattled
so
here
we
are
the
cab
stopped
with
a
jerk
here
they
were
then
a
gate
swung
to
behind
them
there
was
a
little
drive
with
bushes
on
either
side
of
it
and
then
the
house
not
a
very
handsome
house
maggie
thought
a
dull
square
grey
with
chimneys
like
ears
in
exactly
the
right
places
some
pieces
of
paper
were
whirled
up
and
down
by
the
wind
they
danced
about
the
feet
she
noticed
that
the
needed
polishing
a
cavernous
hall
a
young
girl
with
untidy
hair
and
a
yelping
dog
received
them
that
mitch
said
paul
dear
old
mitch
how
are
you
dear
old
fellow
down
mitch
down
there
a
good
dog
the
young
girl
was
terrified
of
maggie
she
gulped
through
her
nose
i
put
tea
in
the
study
sir
she
said
tea
at
once
little
woman
eh
said
paul
i
dying
for
some
thank
you
emily
all
well
that
right
dear
dear
it
is
nice
to
be
home
again
yes
he
was
nervous
poor
paul
she
felt
a
great
tenderness
for
him
but
she
could
not
say
the
right
words
she
should
have
said
it
is
nice
but
it
was
not
the
hall
was
so
cold
and
dark
and
all
over
the
house
windows
were
rattling
they
went
straight
into
the
study
what
a
room
it
reminded
maggie
at
once
in
its
untidiness
and
discomfort
of
her
father
study
and
that
thought
struck
a
chill
into
her
very
heart
so
that
she
had
to
pause
for
a
moment
and
control
herself
there
were
piles
of
newspapers
heaped
up
against
the
shelves
books
run
to
the
ceiling
old
old
books
with
the
covers
tumbling
off
them
on
the
stone
mantelpiece
was
a
perfect
litter
old
pipes
bundles
of
letters
a
ball
of
string
some
yellow
photographs
a
crucifix
and
a
small
plant
dead
and
shrivelled
in
its
pot
now
then
darling
hurrah
for
some
tea
she
poured
it
out
and
he
watched
her
in
an
ecstasy
strangely
she
began
to
be
frightened
and
a
little
breathless
as
though
the
walls
of
the
room
were
slowly
closing
in
the
tea
had
been
standing
a
long
time
it
was
very
strong
and
chill
the
house
was
a
of
rattle
and
whirs
but
there
were
no
human
sounds
anywhere
there
was
dust
all
over
the
room
they
had
said
nothing
for
some
time
he
spoke
suddenly
his
voice
husky
and
awkward
as
though
he
were
trying
a
new
voice
for
the
first
time
maggie
he
said
do
sit
so
far
away
come
over
here
she
crossed
over
to
him
he
with
an
arm
that
seemed
to
be
suddenly
of
iron
pulled
her
on
to
his
knee
she
was
rebellious
her
whole
body
stiffened
she
did
not
want
this
she
did
not
want
this
some
voice
within
cried
out
take
care
take
care
he
pressed
her
close
to
him
he
kissed
her
furiously
savagely
her
eyes
her
mouth
her
cheek
she
could
feel
his
heart
pounding
beneath
his
clothes
like
a
savage
beast
his
hands
were
all
about
her
he
was
crushing
her
so
that
she
was
hurt
but
she
did
not
feel
that
at
all
there
was
something
else
with
all
her
might
she
fought
down
her
resistance
this
was
her
duty
she
must
obey
but
something
desolate
and
utterly
utterly
lonely
crept
away
and
cried
bitterly
watching
her
surrender
chapter
iii
she
was
swinging
higher
higher
higher
swinging
with
that
delightful
rhythm
that
one
knows
best
in
dreams
lazily
idly
and
yet
with
purpose
and
resolve
she
was
swinging
far
above
the
pain
the
rebellion
the
surrender
that
was
left
for
ever
the
time
of
her
tears
of
her
loneliness
was
over
above
her
yet
distant
was
a
golden
cloud
soft
iridescent
and
in
the
heart
of
this
lay
she
knew
the
solution
of
the
mystery
when
she
reached
it
the
puzzle
would
be
resolved
and
in
a
wonderful
tranquillity
she
could
rest
after
her
journey
nearer
and
nearer
she
swung
the
cloud
was
a
blaze
of
gold
so
that
she
must
not
look
but
could
feel
its
warmth
and
heat
already
irradiating
about
her
only
to
know
to
connect
the
two
worlds
to
find
the
bridge
to
destroy
the
gulf
then
suddenly
the
rhythm
changed
she
was
descending
again
slowly
the
cloud
diminished
a
globe
of
light
a
ball
of
fire
a
dazzling
star
the
air
was
cold
her
eyes
could
not
penetrate
the
dark
with
a
sigh
she
awoke
it
was
early
morning
and
a
filmy
white
shadow
pervaded
the
room
for
a
moment
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
she
saw
the
ghostly
shadows
of
chairs
of
the
chest
of
drawers
of
a
high
cupboard
then
the
large
picture
of
the
crucifixion
very
very
dim
reminded
her
she
knew
where
she
was
she
turned
and
saw
her
husband
sleeping
at
her
side
huddled
like
a
child
his
face
on
his
arm
gently
breathing
in
the
deepest
sleep
she
watched
him
there
had
been
a
moment
that
night
when
she
had
hated
him
hated
him
so
bitterly
that
she
could
have
fought
him
and
even
killed
him
there
had
been
another
moment
after
that
when
she
had
been
so
miserable
that
her
own
death
seemed
the
only
solution
when
she
had
watched
him
tumble
into
sleep
and
had
herself
lain
with
burning
eyes
and
her
flesh
dry
and
hot
staring
into
the
dark
ashamed
humiliated
then
the
old
maggie
had
come
to
her
rescue
the
old
maggie
who
bade
her
make
the
best
of
her
conditions
whatever
they
might
be
who
told
her
there
was
humour
in
everything
hope
always
courage
everywhere
and
that
in
her
own
inviolable
soul
lay
her
strength
that
no
one
could
defeat
her
did
she
not
defeat
herself
now
most
strangely
in
that
early
light
she
felt
a
great
tenderness
for
him
the
tenderness
of
the
mother
for
the
child
she
put
out
her
hand
touched
his
shoulder
stroked
it
with
her
hand
laid
her
head
against
it
he
murmuring
in
his
sleep
turned
towards
her
put
his
arm
around
her
and
so
in
the
shadow
of
his
heart
she
fell
into
deep
dreamless
slumber
at
breakfast
that
morning
she
felt
with
him
a
strange
shyness
and
confusion
she
had
never
been
shy
with
him
before
at
the
very
first
she
had
been
completely
at
her
ease
that
had
been
one
of
his
greatest
attractions
for
her
but
now
she
realised
that
she
would
be
for
a
whole
fortnight
alone
with
him
that
she
did
not
know
him
in
the
least
and
that
he
himself
was
strangely
embarrassed
by
his
own
discoveries
that
he
was
making
so
they
both
of
them
took
the
world
that
was
on
every
side
of
them
put
it
in
between
them
and
left
their
personal
relationship
to
wait
for
a
better
time
maggie
was
childishly
excited
she
had
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
house
of
her
own
to
order
and
arrange
by
the
middle
of
that
first
afternoon
she
had
forgotten
that
paul
existed
she
admitted
to
herself
at
once
so
that
there
should
be
no
pretence
about
the
matter
that
the
house
was
hideous
yes
it
hideous
she
said
aloud
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
and
looking
about
her
it
never
could
have
been
very
much
of
a
house
but
they
meaning
paul
and
grace
had
certainly
not
done
their
best
for
it
maggie
had
had
no
education
she
had
not
perhaps
much
natural
taste
but
she
knew
when
things
and
people
were
sympathetic
and
this
house
was
as
unsympathetic
as
a
house
could
well
be
to
begin
with
the
were
awful
in
the
there
was
a
dark
dead
green
with
some
kind
of
pink
flower
the
was
dressed
in
a
kind
of
squashed
strawberry
colour
the
of
the
staircases
and
passages
was
of
imitation
marble
and
the
three
bedrooms
were
pink
green
and
yellow
perfect
horticultural
shows
it
was
the
distinctive
quality
of
all
the
that
nothing
looked
well
against
them
and
the
cheap
reproductions
in
gilt
frames
the
religious
prints
the
photographs
groups
of
the
rev
paul
at
cambridge
at
ermand
theological
college
with
the
skeaton
band
of
hope
were
all
equally
forlorn
and
out
of
place
it
was
evident
that
everything
in
the
house
was
arranged
and
intended
to
stay
for
ever
where
it
was
the
chairs
against
the
walls
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpieces
the
the
plush
mats
the
bright
red
pots
with
ferns
the
long
blue
vases
and
yet
the
impression
was
not
one
of
discipline
and
order
aunt
anne
house
had
been
untidy
but
it
had
had
an
odd
life
and
atmosphere
of
its
own
this
house
was
dead
utterly
and
completely
dead
the
windows
of
the
looked
out
on
to
a
lawn
and
round
the
lawn
was
a
stone
wall
with
broken
glass
to
protect
it
as
though
there
were
anything
to
steal
thought
maggie
but
then
you
can
not
expect
a
garden
to
look
its
best
at
the
beginning
of
april
i
wait
a
little
thought
maggie
and
then
i
make
this
house
better
i
destroy
almost
everything
in
it
about
with
rather
a
quaking
heart
maggie
penetrated
the
kitchen
here
were
gathered
together
alice
the
cook
emily
the
housemaid
and
clara
the
between
maid
alice
was
large
florid
and
genial
nevertheless
at
once
maggie
distrusted
her
no
servant
had
any
right
to
appear
so
wildly
delighted
to
see
a
new
mistress
alice
had
doubtless
her
own
plans
emily
was
prim
and
conceited
and
clara
did
not
exist
alice
was
ready
to
do
everything
that
maggie
wanted
and
it
was
very
apparent
at
once
that
she
had
not
liked
miss
grace
ah
that
be
much
better
than
the
way
miss
grace
it
mum
in
their
jackets
mum
very
well
certainly
that
would
be
better
i
think
you
better
just
give
us
what
seems
easiest
for
dinner
cook
said
maggie
thereby
handing
herself
over
delivered
and
bound
very
well
mum
i
sure
i
do
my
best
said
alice
early
on
that
first
afternoon
she
was
taken
to
see
the
church
for
a
desperate
moment
her
spirits
failed
her
as
she
stood
at
the
end
of
the
lane
and
looked
this
was
a
church
of
the
newest
red
brick
and
every
seat
was
of
the
most
shining
wood
the
east
end
window
was
flaming
purple
with
a
crimson
christ
ascending
and
yellow
and
blue
disciples
amazed
together
on
the
ground
paul
stood
flushed
with
pride
and
pleasure
his
hand
through
maggie
arm
that
a
partright
window
he
said
with
that
inflection
that
maggie
was
already
beginning
to
think
of
as
his
public
voice
i
afraid
paul
dear
said
maggie
i
very
ignorant
do
know
partright
oh
he
the
great
man
of
the
last
thirty
years
did
the
great
east
window
of
martin
pontefract
we
had
a
job
to
get
him
i
can
tell
you
just
look
at
that
purple
on
the
right
you
see
the
memorial
tablet
to
our
brave
lads
who
fell
in
the
south
african
war
dulce
et
decorum
est
pro
patria
mori
very
appropriate
brave
fellows
brave
fellows
just
behind
you
maggie
is
the
mickleham
font
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
modern
in
the
county
given
to
us
by
sir
joseph
mickleham
mickleham
hall
you
know
only
two
miles
from
here
he
used
to
attend
morning
service
here
frequently
died
five
years
ago
fine
piece
of
work
maggie
looked
at
it
it
was
enormous
a
huge
battlement
of
a
font
in
dead
white
stone
with
wreaths
of
carved
ivy
creeping
about
it
it
makes
one
feel
rather
shivery
said
maggie
now
you
must
see
our
lectern
said
paul
eagerly
and
so
it
continued
there
was
apparently
a
great
deal
to
be
said
about
the
lectern
and
then
about
the
and
then
about
the
reredos
and
then
about
the
pulpit
and
then
about
the
vestry
and
then
about
the
for
the
poor
and
then
about
the
hassocks
and
finally
about
the
graveyard
to
all
this
maggie
listened
and
hoped
that
she
made
the
proper
answers
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
she
was
cold
and
dismayed
the
chapel
had
been
ugly
enough
but
behind
its
ugliness
there
had
been
life
now
with
the
church
as
with
the
house
there
was
no
life
visible
paul
putting
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
said
here
darling
will
be
the
centre
of
our
lives
this
is
our
temple
round
this
building
all
our
happiness
will
revolve
yes
dear
said
maggie
she
was
taken
then
for
a
little
walk
they
went
down
ivy
road
and
into
skeaton
high
street
here
were
the
shops
mr
bloods
the
bookseller
tunstall
the
butcher
toogood
the
grocer
father
the
draper
minster
the
harcourt
the
haberdasher
and
so
on
maggie
rather
liked
the
high
street
it
reminded
her
of
the
high
street
in
polchester
although
there
was
no
hill
out
of
the
high
street
and
on
to
the
esplanade
you
should
never
see
an
esplanade
out
of
the
season
katherine
had
once
said
to
maggie
that
dictum
seemed
certainly
true
this
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
this
esplanade
was
not
looking
its
best
under
the
blustering
march
wind
here
a
deserted
bandstand
there
a
railway
station
here
a
dead
haunt
for
pierrots
there
a
closed
and
barred
cinema
house
here
a
row
of
stranded
there
a
shuttered
and
not
a
living
soul
in
sight
in
front
of
them
was
a
long
long
stretch
of
sand
behind
them
to
right
and
left
the
huddled
tenements
of
the
town
in
front
of
them
beyond
the
sand
the
grey
sea
and
again
not
a
living
soul
in
sight
the
railway
line
wound
its
way
at
their
side
losing
itself
in
the
hills
and
woods
of
the
horizon
there
are
not
many
people
about
are
there
said
maggie
nor
could
she
wonder
the
east
wind
cut
along
the
desolate
stretches
of
silence
and
yet
how
strange
a
wind
it
seemed
to
have
no
effect
at
all
upon
the
sea
which
rolled
in
sluggishly
with
motion
throwing
up
on
the
dim
colourless
beach
a
thin
fringe
of
foam
baring
its
teeth
at
the
world
in
impotent
discontent
oh
there
a
boy
cried
maggie
amazed
at
her
own
relief
how
often
do
the
trains
come
in
she
asked
well
we
do
have
many
trains
in
the
said
paul
they
put
on
several
extra
ones
in
the
summer
oh
what
the
sand
doing
maggie
cried
she
had
seen
sand
often
enough
in
her
own
glebeshire
but
never
sand
like
this
under
the
influence
of
the
wind
it
was
blowing
and
curving
into
little
spirals
of
dust
a
sudden
cloud
with
a
kind
of
personal
animosity
rose
and
flung
itself
across
the
rails
at
maggie
and
paul
they
were
choking
and
blinded
and
in
the
distance
clouds
of
sand
rose
and
fell
with
gusts
and
impulses
that
seemed
personal
and
alive
what
funny
sand
said
maggie
again
when
it
blows
in
glebeshire
it
blows
and
there
a
perfect
storm
there
a
storm
or
there
is
here
she
broke
off
she
could
see
that
paul
had
the
least
idea
of
what
she
was
speaking
the
sand
is
always
blowing
about
here
he
said
now
what
about
tea
they
walked
back
through
the
high
street
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
does
nobody
live
here
asked
maggie
the
population
said
paul
quite
gravely
is
eight
thousand
four
hundred
and
oh
i
see
said
maggie
they
had
tea
in
the
dusty
study
again
i
going
to
change
this
house
said
maggie
change
it
asked
paul
what
my
little
girl
going
to
do
she
going
to
destroy
ever
so
many
things
said
maggie
you
better
wait
said
paul
moving
a
little
away
until
grace
comes
back
dear
you
can
consult
with
her
maggie
said
nothing
next
day
constantine
miss
purves
and
maxse
came
to
tea
they
had
tea
in
the
all
amongst
the
squashed
strawberries
three
large
ferns
in
crimson
pots
watched
them
as
they
ate
maggie
thought
grace
seems
to
have
a
passion
for
ferns
she
had
been
terribly
nervous
before
the
ladies
arrival
that
old
nervousness
that
had
made
her
tremble
before
aunt
anne
at
dreot
before
the
warlocks
before
old
martha
but
with
it
came
as
always
her
sense
of
independence
and
individuality
they
ca
eat
me
she
thought
it
was
obvious
at
once
that
they
did
not
want
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
they
were
full
of
kindness
and
curiosity
constantine
took
the
lead
and
it
was
plain
that
she
had
been
doing
this
all
her
life
she
was
a
large
black
and
red
woman
with
clothes
that
fitted
her
like
a
uniform
her
hair
was
of
a
raven
gleaming
blackness
her
cheeks
were
red
her
manner
so
assured
and
commanding
that
she
seemed
to
maggie
at
once
like
a
policeman
directing
the
traffic
the
policeman
of
christian
skeaton
she
was
and
it
did
not
take
maggie
two
minutes
to
discover
that
paul
was
afraid
of
her
she
had
a
deep
bass
voice
and
a
hearty
laugh
i
can
understand
her
thought
maggie
and
i
believe
understand
me
very
different
miss
purves
if
constantine
was
the
policeman
of
skeaton
miss
purves
was
the
she
rang
her
bell
and
announced
the
news
and
also
insisted
that
you
should
tell
her
without
delay
any
item
of
news
that
you
had
collected
in
appearance
she
was
like
any
old
maid
whose
love
of
gossip
has
led
her
to
abandon
her
appearance
she
had
obviously
surrendered
the
idea
of
attracting
the
male
and
flung
on
her
clothes
an
old
black
hat
a
grey
coat
and
skirt
with
a
negligence
that
showed
that
she
cared
for
worthier
things
she
gave
the
impression
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
were
one
to
gather
all
the
things
in
life
worth
hearing
if
constantine
stood
for
the
police
and
miss
purves
the
maxse
certainly
represented
society
she
was
dressed
beautifully
and
she
must
have
been
very
pretty
once
her
hair
was
now
grey
but
her
cheeks
had
still
a
charming
bloom
she
was
delicate
and
fragile
rustling
and
scented
with
a
beautiful
string
of
pearls
round
her
neck
this
in
the
daytime
maggie
thought
very
odd
and
a
large
black
hat
with
a
sweeping
feather
her
voice
was
a
little
sad
a
little
regretful
as
though
she
knew
that
her
beautiful
youth
was
gone
and
was
making
the
best
of
what
she
had
she
told
maggie
that
she
could
help
being
an
idealist
i
know
it
foolish
of
me
she
said
in
her
gentle
voice
smiling
her
charming
smile
they
all
tell
me
so
but
if
life
is
meant
to
be
beautiful
where
are
we
everything
must
have
a
meaning
must
it
trenchard
and
however
often
we
fail
and
after
all
we
are
only
human
we
must
try
try
again
i
believe
in
seeing
the
best
in
people
because
then
they
live
up
to
that
people
are
what
we
make
them
you
think
the
woman
a
fool
thought
maggie
nevertheless
she
liked
her
kindness
she
was
so
strangely
driven
she
wished
to
think
of
martin
always
never
to
forget
him
but
at
the
same
time
not
to
think
of
the
life
that
was
connected
with
him
she
must
never
think
of
him
as
some
one
who
might
return
did
that
once
begin
all
this
present
life
would
be
impossible
and
she
meant
to
make
this
new
existence
not
only
possible
but
successful
therefore
she
was
building
so
hard
as
she
could
this
new
house
the
walls
were
rising
the
rooms
were
prepared
every
window
was
barred
the
doors
were
locked
no
one
from
outside
should
enter
and
everything
that
belonged
to
it
paul
grace
the
church
these
women
skeaton
itself
her
household
duties
the
servants
everything
and
every
one
was
pressed
into
service
she
must
have
so
much
to
do
that
she
could
not
think
she
must
like
every
one
else
so
much
that
she
could
not
want
any
one
else
that
other
world
must
be
kept
out
no
sound
nor
sight
of
it
must
enter
if
even
she
could
forget
martin
what
had
he
said
to
her
promise
me
whatever
i
am
whatever
i
do
you
will
love
me
always
and
she
had
promised
here
she
was
married
to
paul
and
loving
martin
more
than
ever
as
she
looked
at
constantine
she
wondered
what
she
would
say
did
she
know
that
nevertheless
she
had
not
deceived
paul
she
had
told
him
she
would
make
this
right
she
would
force
this
life
to
give
her
what
she
needed
work
and
friends
and
a
place
in
the
world
her
face
a
little
white
with
her
struggle
to
keep
her
house
standing
she
turned
to
her
guests
she
was
afraid
that
she
did
not
play
the
hostess
very
well
she
felt
as
though
she
were
she
repeated
phrases
that
she
had
heard
katherine
mark
use
and
laughed
at
herself
for
doing
so
she
suspected
that
they
thought
her
very
odd
and
she
fancied
that
constantine
looked
at
her
short
hair
with
grave
suspicion
afterwards
when
she
told
paul
this
he
was
rather
uncomfortable
it
soon
be
long
again
dear
wo
it
he
said
do
you
like
it
short
then
she
asked
of
course
i
like
it
but
there
no
reason
to
be
unusual
is
there
we
do
want
to
seem
different
from
other
people
do
we
darling
i
do
know
said
maggie
we
want
to
be
ourselves
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
grow
my
hair
long
again
it
so
much
more
comfortable
like
this
if
i
ask
you
dear
said
paul
no
not
even
if
you
ask
me
she
answered
laughing
she
noticed
then
for
the
first
time
that
he
could
look
sulky
like
a
small
why
paul
she
said
if
you
wanted
to
grow
a
beard
i
should
like
it
but
i
should
dream
of
stopping
you
that
quite
different
he
answered
i
should
never
dream
of
growing
a
beard
grace
wo
like
it
if
you
look
odd
grace
is
my
teacher
said
maggie
with
a
sudden
hot
hostility
that
surprised
herself
she
discovered
by
the
way
very
quickly
that
the
three
ladies
had
no
very
warm
feelings
for
grace
they
showed
undisguised
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
maggie
would
now
be
on
various
committees
instead
of
her
it
will
be
your
place
of
course
as
wife
of
the
vicar
said
constantine
hitherto
miss
trenchard
oh
but
i
could
be
on
a
committee
cried
maggie
i
never
been
on
one
in
my
life
i
should
never
know
what
to
do
never
been
on
a
committee
cried
miss
purves
quivering
with
interest
why
trenchard
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
i
only
twenty
said
maggie
they
certainly
thought
it
strange
of
her
to
confess
to
her
age
like
that
at
home
father
never
had
any
committees
he
did
it
all
himself
or
rather
did
do
it
constantine
shook
her
head
we
must
all
help
you
she
said
you
very
young
my
dear
for
the
responsibilities
of
this
parish
yes
i
am
said
maggie
frankly
and
i
be
very
glad
of
anything
you
can
tell
me
but
you
must
let
me
be
treasurer
or
secretary
of
anything
i
should
never
answer
any
of
the
letters
and
i
should
probably
spend
all
the
money
myself
my
dear
you
should
say
such
things
even
as
a
joke
said
constantine
but
it
is
a
joke
said
maggie
i
terribly
muddleheaded
and
i
no
idea
of
money
at
all
paul
going
to
teach
me
paul
smiled
nervously
maggie
will
soon
fit
into
our
ways
he
said
i
sure
she
will
said
constantine
very
kindly
but
as
though
she
were
speaking
to
a
child
of
ten
the
bell
rang
and
flaunders
the
curate
came
in
he
was
very
young
very
earnest
and
very
enthusiastic
he
adored
paul
he
told
maggie
that
he
thought
that
he
was
the
very
luckiest
man
in
the
world
for
having
so
early
in
his
career
so
wonderful
a
man
as
paul
to
work
under
he
had
also
adored
grace
but
very
quickly
showed
signs
of
transferring
that
adoration
to
maggie
miss
trenchard
splendid
he
said
i
do
admire
her
so
but
be
a
great
help
to
us
all
i
so
glad
you
come
why
how
do
you
know
asked
maggie
you
only
seen
me
for
about
two
minutes
ah
one
can
tell
said
flaunders
sighing
maggie
liked
his
enthusiasm
but
she
could
help
wishing
that
his
knees
would
crack
at
unexpected
moments
that
he
was
quite
so
long
and
thin
and
that
he
would
leave
dried
under
his
ears
and
in
his
nostrils
she
was
puzzled
too
that
paul
should
be
so
obviously
pleased
with
the
rather
naif
adoration
paul
likes
you
to
praise
him
she
thought
a
little
regretfully
so
for
the
moment
these
people
the
house
and
the
church
fitted
in
her
world
for
the
rest
of
the
fortnight
she
was
so
busy
that
she
never
went
on
to
the
beach
nor
into
the
woods
she
shopped
every
morning
feeling
very
old
and
she
went
to
tea
with
constantine
and
maxse
and
she
sat
on
paul
knee
whenever
she
thought
that
he
would
like
her
to
she
sat
on
paul
knee
but
that
did
not
mean
that
in
real
intimacy
they
approached
any
nearer
to
one
another
during
those
days
they
stared
at
one
another
like
children
on
different
sides
of
a
fence
they
were
definitely
postponing
settlement
and
with
every
day
maggie
grew
more
restless
and
uneasy
she
wanted
back
that
old
friendly
comradeship
that
there
had
been
before
their
marriage
he
seemed
now
to
have
lost
altogether
that
attitude
to
her
then
on
the
very
day
of
grace
return
the
storm
broke
it
was
and
they
were
having
it
as
usual
in
his
dusty
study
they
were
sitting
someway
apart
paul
in
the
old
leather
armchair
by
the
fire
his
thick
body
stretched
out
his
cheerful
face
puckered
and
peevish
maggie
stood
up
looking
at
him
paul
what
the
matter
she
asked
matter
he
repeated
nothing
oh
yes
there
is
you
cross
with
me
no
i
not
what
an
absurd
idea
he
moved
restlessly
turning
half
away
not
looking
at
her
she
came
close
up
to
him
look
here
paul
there
is
something
the
matter
we
have
been
married
a
fortnight
yet
and
you
unhappy
whatever
else
we
married
for
we
married
because
we
were
going
to
be
friends
so
you
just
got
to
tell
me
what
the
trouble
is
i
got
my
sermon
to
prepare
he
said
not
looking
at
her
but
half
rising
in
his
chair
you
better
go
darling
i
not
going
to
she
answered
until
you
told
me
why
worrying
he
got
up
slowly
and
seemed
then
as
though
he
were
going
to
pass
her
suddenly
he
turned
flung
his
arms
round
her
catching
her
crushing
her
in
his
arms
kissing
her
wildly
love
love
me
love
me
he
whispered
that
what
the
matter
i
did
know
myself
before
i
married
you
maggie
all
these
years
i
lived
like
a
fish
and
i
did
know
it
but
i
know
it
now
and
you
got
to
love
me
you
my
wife
and
you
got
to
love
me
she
would
have
given
everything
that
she
had
then
to
respond
she
felt
an
infinite
tenderness
and
pity
for
him
but
she
could
not
he
felt
that
she
could
not
he
let
her
go
and
turned
away
from
her
she
thought
for
a
moment
wondering
what
she
ought
to
say
and
then
she
came
up
to
him
and
gently
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
be
patient
paul
she
said
you
know
we
agreed
before
we
married
that
we
be
friends
at
any
rate
and
let
the
rest
come
wait
wait
he
turned
round
eagerly
clutching
her
arm
then
there
is
a
chance
maggie
you
can
get
to
love
me
you
can
forget
that
other
man
she
drew
back
no
you
know
i
told
you
that
i
should
never
do
that
but
he
never
come
back
nor
want
me
again
and
i
very
fond
of
you
paul
fonder
than
i
thought
do
spoil
it
all
now
by
going
too
fast
going
too
fast
he
laughed
why
i
have
gone
any
way
at
all
i
have
got
you
anywhere
i
can
hardly
touch
you
you
away
from
me
all
the
time
you
strange
different
from
every
one
i
do
know
anything
about
women
i
learnt
a
lot
about
myself
this
week
it
is
going
to
be
as
easy
as
i
thought
she
went
up
to
him
close
to
him
and
said
almost
desperately
we
must
make
this
all
right
paul
we
can
if
we
try
i
know
we
can
he
kissed
her
gently
with
his
old
kindness
what
a
baby
you
are
you
did
know
what
you
were
in
for
oh
we
make
it
all
right
they
sat
close
together
then
and
drank
their
tea
after
all
grace
would
be
here
in
an
hour
they
both
felt
a
kind
of
relief
that
they
would
no
longer
be
alone
grace
would
be
here
in
an
hour
strange
how
throughout
all
these
last
days
maggie
had
been
looking
forward
to
that
event
with
dread
there
was
no
definite
reason
for
fear
in
london
grace
had
been
kindness
itself
and
had
shown
real
affection
for
maggie
within
the
last
week
she
had
written
two
very
affectionate
letters
what
was
this
then
that
hung
and
hovered
it
was
in
the
very
air
of
the
house
and
the
garden
and
the
place
grace
had
left
her
mark
upon
everything
and
every
one
even
upon
the
meagre
person
of
mitch
the
dog
especially
upon
mitch
a
miserable
creeping
with
no
spirits
and
a
tendency
to
tremble
all
over
when
you
called
him
he
had
attached
himself
to
maggie
which
was
strange
because
animals
were
not
as
a
rule
interested
in
her
mitch
followed
her
about
looking
up
at
her
with
a
yellow
supplicating
eye
she
did
like
him
and
she
would
be
glad
when
grace
collected
him
again
but
why
did
he
tremble
she
realised
in
the
way
that
she
had
of
seeing
further
than
her
nose
that
grace
was
going
to
affect
the
whole
of
her
relations
with
paul
and
indeed
all
her
future
life
she
had
not
realised
that
in
london
grace
had
seemed
harmless
there
and
unimportant
already
here
in
skeaton
she
seemed
to
stand
for
a
whole
scheme
of
life
maggie
had
moved
and
altered
a
good
many
of
the
things
in
the
house
she
had
discovered
a
small
attic
and
into
this
she
had
piled
a
number
of
photographs
cheap
reproductions
cushions
worsted
mats
and
china
ornaments
she
had
done
it
gaily
and
with
a
sense
of
clearing
the
air
now
as
grace
hour
approached
she
was
not
so
sure
well
i
not
afraid
she
reassured
herself
with
her
favourite
defiance
she
ca
eat
me
and
it
my
house
paul
had
not
noticed
the
alterations
he
was
always
blind
to
his
surroundings
unless
they
were
what
he
called
queer
there
was
the
rattle
of
the
on
the
drive
and
a
moment
later
grace
was
in
the
hall
dear
paul
maggie
dear
she
stood
there
a
very
solid
and
assured
figure
she
was
square
and
thick
and
reminded
maggie
of
noah
her
clothes
stood
cut
out
around
her
as
though
they
had
been
cut
in
wood
she
had
her
large
amiable
smile
and
the
kiss
that
she
gave
maggie
was
a
wet
soft
and
very
friendly
one
now
i
think
i
have
tea
at
once
without
taking
my
hat
off
in
study
that
nice
maggie
dear
how
are
you
such
a
journey
but
astonishing
just
fancy
i
got
into
charing
cross
and
then
why
here
the
study
fancy
maggie
dear
how
are
you
well
right
why
there
tea
that
right
everything
just
as
it
was
fancy
she
took
off
her
gloves
smiled
seated
herself
more
comfortably
then
began
to
look
about
the
room
suddenly
there
came
why
paul
where
the
emmanuel
football
group
there
was
a
moment
silence
maggie
felt
her
heart
give
a
little
bump
as
it
seemed
to
her
right
against
the
roof
of
her
mouth
paul
so
like
him
had
not
noticed
that
the
football
group
had
vanished
he
stared
at
the
blank
place
on
the
wall
where
it
had
once
been
why
grace
i
do
know
i
never
noticed
it
was
there
i
took
it
down
said
maggie
i
thought
there
were
too
many
photographs
it
in
the
attic
in
the
attic
fancy
you
put
it
away
did
you
maggie
well
fancy
sha
i
make
the
tea
maggie
dear
that
it
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
know
how
to
manage
it
they
changed
seats
grace
was
as
amiable
as
ever
but
now
her
eyes
flashed
about
from
place
to
place
all
around
the
room
why
this
is
a
new
kind
of
jam
how
nice
as
i
was
saying
i
got
into
charing
cross
and
there
was
a
porter
just
fancy
at
least
there
was
a
porter
an
old
man
but
when
i
beckoned
to
him
he
would
move
well
i
was
angry
i
can
tell
you
paul
i
was
going
to
stand
that
so
nice
jam
dear
i
never
knew
mitchell
had
jam
like
this
i
did
get
it
at
mitchell
said
maggie
i
changed
the
grocer
mitchell
has
got
anything
and
his
prices
are
just
about
double
brownjohn
brownjohn
grace
stared
her
bread
and
jam
suspended
brownjohn
but
maggie
dear
he
a
dissenter
oh
maggie
said
paul
you
should
have
told
me
why
said
maggie
bewildered
father
never
minded
about
dissenters
our
butcher
in
dreot
was
an
atheist
and
well
well
said
grace
her
eyes
still
flashing
about
like
goldfish
in
a
pool
you
did
know
dear
of
course
you
did
i
sure
we
can
put
it
right
with
mitchell
although
he
a
sensitive
man
i
go
and
see
him
in
the
morning
i
am
glad
i
back
well
i
was
telling
you
where
was
i
about
the
porter
something
drove
maggie
to
say
i
rather
have
a
good
grocer
who
a
dissenter
than
a
bad
one
who
goes
to
church
maggie
said
paul
you
do
know
what
you
saying
you
realise
what
the
effect
in
the
parish
would
be
of
course
she
does
said
grace
consolingly
she
understand
in
time
as
i
was
saying
i
was
so
angry
that
i
caught
the
old
man
by
the
arm
and
i
said
to
him
you
think
you
paid
to
lean
up
against
a
wall
and
not
do
your
duty
you
mightily
mistaken
and
if
you
careful
i
report
you
that
what
i
do
and
he
said
what
were
his
exact
words
i
remember
in
a
minute
i
know
he
was
very
insulting
and
the
why
paul
where
mother
picture
grace
eyes
were
directed
to
a
large
space
high
above
the
mantelpiece
maggie
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
big
faded
of
an
old
lady
in
a
shawl
and
spectacles
a
hideous
affair
she
had
thought
it
that
was
now
reposing
in
the
attic
why
had
she
not
known
that
it
was
a
picture
of
paul
mother
she
would
never
have
touched
it
had
she
known
why
had
paul
said
nothing
he
had
not
even
noticed
that
it
was
gone
paul
stared
amazed
and
certainly
yes
beyond
question
frightened
grace
upon
my
word
i
been
so
busy
since
my
return
is
that
also
in
the
attic
asked
grace
yes
it
is
said
maggie
i
so
sorry
i
never
knew
it
was
your
mother
it
was
a
very
good
painting
i
thought
so
i
took
it
down
if
i
had
known
of
course
i
never
would
have
touched
it
oh
grace
i
am
so
sorry
it
been
there
said
grace
for
nearly
twenty
years
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
it
always
been
there
poor
mother
are
there
many
things
in
the
attic
maggie
at
that
moment
there
was
a
feeble
scratching
on
the
door
paul
evidently
glad
of
anything
that
would
relieve
the
situation
opened
the
door
why
it
mitch
cried
grace
forgetting
for
the
moment
her
mother
fancy
it
mitch
mitch
dear
was
she
glad
to
see
her
old
friend
back
again
was
she
darling
fancy
seeing
her
old
friend
again
was
she
wanting
her
back
mitch
stood
shivering
in
the
doorway
then
with
her
halting
step
the
skin
of
her
back
wrinkled
with
anxiety
she
crossed
the
room
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
then
with
shamefaced
terror
slunk
to
maggie
pressed
up
against
her
and
sat
there
huddled
staring
at
grace
with
yellow
unfriendly
eyes
chapter
iv
grace
not
in
a
day
and
not
in
a
night
did
maggie
find
a
key
to
that
strange
confusion
of
fears
superstitions
and
that
was
known
to
the
world
as
grace
trenchard
perhaps
she
never
found
it
and
through
all
the
struggle
and
conflict
in
which
she
was
now
to
be
involved
she
was
fighting
desperately
in
the
dark
fight
she
did
and
it
was
this
same
conflict
bitter
and
tragic
enough
at
the
time
that
transformed
her
into
the
woman
that
she
became
and
through
all
that
conflict
it
may
be
truly
said
of
her
that
she
never
knew
a
bitterness
anger
dismay
loneliness
even
never
it
was
not
strange
that
maggie
did
not
understand
grace
grace
never
understood
herself
nor
did
she
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
do
so
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
cover
the
ground
at
once
by
saying
that
she
had
no
imagination
that
she
never
went
behind
the
thing
that
she
saw
and
that
she
found
the
grasping
of
external
things
quite
as
much
as
she
could
manage
but
that
is
not
enough
very
early
indeed
when
she
had
been
a
little
girl
with
a
hot
desire
for
the
doll
possessed
by
her
neighbour
she
had
had
for
nurse
a
woman
who
rejoiced
in
supernatural
events
with
ghost
stories
of
the
most
terrifying
kind
she
besieged
grace
young
heart
and
mind
the
child
had
never
imagination
enough
to
visualise
these
stories
in
the
true
essence
but
she
seized
upon
external
blue
lights
the
white
shimmering
garments
the
moon
and
the
church
clock
the
clanking
chain
and
the
stain
of
blood
upon
the
board
these
things
were
not
for
her
and
indeed
did
she
allow
her
fancy
to
dwell
for
a
moment
upon
them
she
was
besieged
at
once
by
so
horrid
a
panic
that
she
lost
all
control
and
she
therefore
very
quickly
put
those
things
from
her
and
thenceforth
lived
in
the
world
as
in
a
castle
surrounded
by
a
dark
moat
filled
with
horrible
and
slimy
creatures
who
would
raise
a
head
at
her
did
she
so
much
as
glance
their
way
she
decided
then
never
to
look
and
from
a
very
early
age
those
quarters
of
life
became
to
her
queer
indecent
and
dangerous
all
the
more
she
fastened
her
grip
upon
the
things
that
she
could
see
and
hold
and
these
things
repaid
her
devotion
by
never
deceiving
her
or
pretending
to
be
what
they
were
not
she
believed
intensely
in
forms
and
repetitions
she
liked
everything
to
be
where
she
expected
it
to
be
people
to
say
the
things
that
she
expected
them
to
say
clocks
to
strike
at
the
right
time
and
trains
to
be
up
to
the
minute
with
all
this
she
could
never
be
called
an
accurate
or
careful
woman
she
was
radically
stupid
stupid
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
so
that
her
mind
did
not
grasp
a
new
thought
or
fact
until
it
had
been
repeated
to
her
again
and
again
so
that
she
had
no
power
of
expressing
herself
and
a
deep
inaccuracy
about
everything
and
every
one
which
she
endeavoured
to
cover
by
a
stream
of
aimless
lies
that
deceived
no
one
she
would
of
course
have
been
very
indignant
had
any
one
told
her
that
she
was
stupid
she
hated
what
she
called
clever
people
and
never
had
them
near
her
if
she
could
help
it
she
was
instantly
suspicious
of
any
one
who
liked
ideas
or
wanted
anything
changed
with
all
this
she
was
of
an
extreme
obstinacy
and
a
deep
deep
jealousy
she
clung
to
what
she
had
with
the
tenacity
of
a
mollusc
what
she
had
was
in
the
main
paul
and
her
affection
for
him
was
a
very
real
human
quality
in
her
he
was
exactly
what
she
would
have
chosen
had
she
been
allowed
at
the
beginning
a
free
choice
he
was
lazy
and
so
that
he
yielded
to
her
on
every
possible
point
he
was
absolutely
orthodox
and
never
shocked
her
by
a
thought
or
a
word
out
of
the
ordinary
he
really
loved
her
and
believed
in
her
and
said
quite
truly
that
he
would
not
have
known
what
to
do
without
her
it
seems
strange
then
that
it
should
have
been
in
the
main
her
urgency
that
led
to
the
acquisition
of
maggie
during
the
last
year
she
had
begun
to
be
seriously
uneasy
things
were
not
what
they
had
been
constantine
and
others
in
the
parish
were
challenging
her
authority
even
the
choir
boys
were
scarcely
so
subservient
as
they
had
been
and
worst
of
all
paul
himself
was
strangely
restive
and
unquiet
he
talked
at
times
of
getting
married
wondered
whether
she
grace
would
like
some
one
to
help
her
in
the
house
and
even
on
one
terrifying
occasion
suggested
leaving
skeaton
altogether
a
momentary
vision
of
what
it
would
be
to
live
without
paul
to
give
up
her
kingdom
in
skeaton
to
have
to
start
all
over
again
to
acquire
dominion
in
some
new
place
was
enough
for
grace
she
must
find
paul
a
wife
and
she
must
find
some
one
who
would
depend
upon
her
look
up
to
her
obey
her
who
would
incidentally
take
some
of
the
tiresome
and
monotonous
drudgery
off
her
shoulders
the
moment
she
saw
maggie
she
was
resolved
here
was
just
the
creature
a
mouse
of
a
girl
no
parents
no
money
no
appearance
nothing
to
make
her
proud
or
above
herself
some
one
to
be
moulded
and
trained
in
the
way
she
should
go
to
her
great
surprise
she
discovered
that
paul
was
at
once
attracted
by
maggie
had
she
ever
wondered
at
anything
she
would
have
wondered
at
this
but
she
decided
that
it
was
because
she
herself
had
made
the
suggestion
dear
paul
he
was
always
so
eager
to
fall
in
with
any
of
her
proposals
her
mind
misgave
her
a
little
when
she
saw
that
he
was
really
in
love
what
could
he
see
in
that
plain
gauche
uncharming
creature
see
something
he
undoubtedly
did
however
that
would
wear
off
very
quickly
the
skeaton
atmosphere
was
against
romance
and
paul
was
too
lazy
to
be
in
love
very
long
once
or
twice
in
the
weeks
before
the
wedding
grace
suspicions
were
aroused
maggie
seemed
to
be
an
utter
little
heathen
also
it
appeared
that
she
had
had
some
strange
love
affair
that
she
had
taken
so
seriously
as
actually
to
be
ill
over
it
that
was
odd
and
a
little
alarming
but
the
child
was
very
young
and
once
she
be
so
to
speak
it
was
not
in
fact
until
that
evening
of
her
arrival
in
skeaton
that
she
was
seriously
alarmed
to
say
that
that
first
ten
minutes
in
study
alarmed
her
is
to
put
it
mildly
indeed
as
she
looked
at
the
place
where
her
mother
portrait
had
been
as
she
stared
at
the
trembling
mitch
cowering
against
maggie
dress
she
experienced
the
most
terrifying
shattering
upheaval
since
the
day
when
as
a
little
girl
of
six
she
had
been
faced
as
she
had
fancied
with
the
dripping
ghost
of
her
william
not
at
once
however
was
the
battle
to
begin
maggie
gave
way
about
everything
she
gave
way
at
first
because
she
was
so
confident
of
getting
what
she
wanted
later
on
she
never
conceived
that
she
was
not
to
have
final
power
in
her
own
house
paul
had
as
yet
denied
her
nothing
she
moved
the
pictures
and
the
pots
and
the
crochet
work
down
from
the
attic
and
replaced
them
where
they
had
nearly
replaced
them
she
found
it
already
rather
amusing
to
puzzle
grace
by
changing
their
positions
from
day
to
day
so
that
grace
was
bewildered
and
perplexed
grace
said
nothing
only
solidly
and
with
panting
noises
she
suffered
from
shortness
of
breath
plodded
up
and
down
the
house
reassuring
herself
that
all
her
treasures
were
safe
maggie
in
fact
enjoyed
herself
during
the
weeks
immediately
following
grace
return
paul
seemed
tranquil
and
happy
there
were
no
signs
of
fresh
outbreaks
of
the
strange
passion
that
had
so
lately
frightened
her
maggie
herself
found
her
duties
in
connection
with
the
church
and
the
house
easier
than
she
had
expected
every
one
seemed
very
friendly
grace
chattered
on
with
her
aimless
histories
of
unimportant
events
and
patted
maggie
hand
and
smiled
a
great
deal
surely
all
was
very
well
perhaps
this
was
the
life
for
which
maggie
was
intended
and
that
other
life
began
to
be
dim
and
martin
was
a
little
hidden
and
mysterious
strangely
she
was
glad
of
that
the
only
way
that
this
could
be
carried
through
was
by
keeping
the
other
out
of
it
would
the
two
worlds
mingle
would
the
faces
and
voices
of
those
spirits
be
seen
and
heard
again
would
they
leave
maggie
now
or
plan
to
steal
her
back
the
whole
future
of
her
life
depended
on
the
answer
to
that
during
those
weeks
she
investigated
skeaton
very
thoroughly
she
found
that
her
skeaton
the
skeaton
of
fashion
and
the
church
was
a
very
small
affair
consisting
of
two
rows
of
villas
some
detached
houses
that
trickled
into
the
country
and
a
little
clump
of
villas
on
a
hill
over
the
sea
beyond
the
town
there
were
not
more
than
fifty
souls
all
told
in
this
regiment
of
fashion
and
the
leaders
of
the
fifty
were
constantine
maxse
miss
purves
a
tempest
a
large
black
tragic
creature
and
miss
grace
trenchard
and
they
had
for
their
male
supporters
colonel
maxse
william
tempest
a
purdie
rich
and
idle
and
the
reverend
paul
maggie
discovered
that
the
manners
habits
and
even
voices
and
gestures
of
this
sacred
fifty
were
all
the
same
the
only
question
upon
which
they
divided
was
one
of
residence
the
richer
and
finer
division
spent
several
weeks
of
the
winter
abroad
in
places
like
nice
and
cannes
and
the
poorer
contingent
took
their
holiday
from
skeaton
in
the
summer
in
glebeshire
or
the
lake
district
the
constantines
and
the
maxses
were
very
fine
indeed
because
they
went
both
to
cannes
in
the
winter
and
scotland
in
the
summer
it
was
wonderful
considering
how
often
constantine
was
away
from
skeaton
how
solemn
and
an
impression
she
made
and
retained
in
the
skeaton
world
maggie
discovered
that
unless
you
had
a
large
house
with
independent
grounds
outside
the
town
it
was
impossible
to
remain
in
skeaton
during
the
summer
months
oh
the
trippers
oh
the
trippers
yes
they
were
up
the
sands
eggshells
niggers
pierrots
vulgarity
moonlight
embracing
noise
sand
and
dust
if
you
were
any
one
at
all
you
did
not
stay
in
skeaton
during
the
summer
as
i
have
said
you
were
so
grand
that
you
could
disregard
it
altogether
it
happened
that
these
weeks
were
wet
and
windy
and
maggie
was
blown
about
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
there
could
be
no
denying
that
it
was
grim
and
ugly
under
these
conditions
it
might
be
that
when
the
spring
came
there
would
be
flowers
in
the
gardens
and
the
trees
would
break
out
into
fresh
green
and
the
sands
would
gleam
with
and
the
sea
would
glitter
with
sunshine
all
that
perhaps
would
come
meanwhile
there
was
not
a
house
that
was
not
hideous
the
wind
tore
screaming
down
the
long
beaches
carrying
with
it
a
flurry
of
tempestuous
rain
whilst
the
sea
itself
moved
in
sluggish
oily
coils
to
the
grey
horizon
worst
of
all
perhaps
were
the
deserted
buildings
at
other
times
dedicated
to
gaiety
ghosts
of
places
they
were
with
torn
paper
flapping
against
their
sides
and
the
wind
tearing
at
their
roofs
then
there
was
the
desolate
little
station
having
it
seemed
no
connection
with
any
kind
of
behind
all
this
the
woods
howled
and
creaked
and
whistled
derisive
provocative
the
only
creatures
alive
in
all
that
world
between
the
fashion
and
the
place
the
church
stood
as
a
bridge
centuries
ago
when
skeaton
had
been
the
merest
hamlet
clustered
behind
the
beach
the
church
had
been
the
present
building
looking
poor
thing
as
though
it
were
in
a
perpetual
state
of
scarlet
fever
but
a
shabby
humble
little
chapel
close
to
the
sea
sheltered
by
the
sandy
hill
the
present
temple
had
been
built
about
and
was
considered
very
satisfactory
it
was
solid
and
free
from
draughts
and
took
the
central
heating
very
well
the
graveyard
also
was
new
and
shiny
with
no
bones
in
it
remoter
than
the
memories
of
the
present
generation
could
compass
the
church
clock
was
a
very
late
addition
put
up
by
subscription
five
years
its
clamour
was
so
up
to
date
and
smart
that
it
was
a
cross
between
the
whistle
of
a
and
a
rich
and
prosperous
all
this
was
rightly
felt
to
be
very
satisfactory
as
miss
purves
said
so
far
as
the
dear
church
goes
no
one
had
any
right
to
complain
about
anything
when
maggie
had
first
arrived
in
skeaton
her
duties
with
regard
to
the
church
were
made
quite
plain
to
her
she
was
expected
to
take
one
of
the
classes
in
sunday
school
to
attend
choir
practice
on
friday
evening
to
be
on
the
committees
for
old
women
comforts
our
brave
lads
guild
and
the
girls
friendly
society
to
look
after
the
flowers
for
the
altar
and
to
attend
paul
bible
class
on
wednesdays
she
had
no
objection
to
any
of
these
were
after
all
part
of
her
job
she
found
that
they
amused
her
and
her
life
must
be
full
full
full
no
time
to
think
no
time
to
think
some
little
voice
far
far
within
her
cried
but
on
grace
return
difficulties
at
once
arose
grace
had
hitherto
done
all
these
things
she
had
as
she
called
it
played
a
large
part
in
the
life
of
our
church
she
was
bored
with
them
all
the
choir
practices
the
committees
the
altar
flowers
and
the
rest
she
was
only
too
pleased
that
maggie
should
do
the
hard
work
it
was
quite
fair
that
she
grace
should
have
a
rest
at
the
same
time
she
did
not
at
all
want
to
surrender
the
power
that
doing
these
things
had
given
her
she
did
not
wish
maggie
to
take
her
place
but
she
wanted
her
to
support
the
difficult
this
especially
if
you
are
not
good
at
thinking
things
out
grace
never
could
think
things
out
it
seemed
as
though
her
thoughts
loved
wilfully
to
tease
and
confuse
her
then
when
she
was
completely
tangled
and
bewildered
her
temper
rose
slowly
stealthily
but
with
a
mighty
force
behind
it
suddenly
as
a
flood
bursts
the
walls
that
have
been
trying
to
resist
it
it
would
sweep
the
chambers
of
her
mind
submerging
drowning
the
flock
of
little
ideas
she
then
would
lose
her
temper
so
much
to
her
own
surprise
that
she
at
once
decided
that
some
one
else
must
be
responsible
a
few
days
after
her
return
she
decided
that
she
must
not
let
these
things
go
so
she
told
maggie
that
she
would
attend
the
committee
of
old
comforts
and
be
responsible
for
the
choir
practice
but
on
her
return
to
these
functions
she
found
that
she
was
bored
and
tired
and
cross
they
were
really
intolerable
she
had
been
doing
them
for
years
and
years
and
years
it
was
too
bad
that
maggie
should
suffer
her
to
take
them
on
her
shoulders
what
did
maggie
think
she
was
a
clergyman
wife
for
did
maggie
imagine
that
there
were
no
responsibilities
attached
to
her
position
grace
did
not
say
these
things
but
she
thought
them
she
did
not
of
course
admit
to
herself
that
she
wanted
maggie
both
to
go
and
not
to
go
she
simply
knew
that
there
was
a
grievance
and
maggie
was
responsible
for
it
but
at
present
she
was
silent
the
next
factor
in
the
rapidly
developing
situation
was
toms
one
day
early
in
april
maggie
went
for
a
little
walk
by
herself
along
the
lane
that
led
to
marsden
wood
marsden
wood
was
the
most
sinister
of
all
the
woods
there
had
once
been
a
murder
there
but
even
had
there
not
the
grim
bleakness
of
the
trees
and
bushes
the
absence
of
all
clear
paths
through
its
tangles
and
thickets
made
it
a
sinister
place
she
turned
at
the
very
edge
of
the
wood
and
set
her
face
back
towards
skeaton
the
day
had
been
wild
and
windy
with
recurrent
showers
of
rain
but
now
there
was
a
break
the
chilly
april
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
scattered
the
hedges
and
fields
with
primrose
light
faintly
and
with
a
gentle
rhythm
the
murmur
of
the
sea
came
across
the
land
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
and
the
fresh
scent
of
the
grass
after
rain
maggie
stood
for
a
moment
breathing
in
the
spring
air
and
watching
the
watery
blue
thread
its
timid
way
through
banks
of
grey
cloud
a
rich
gleam
of
sunlight
struck
the
path
at
her
feet
she
saw
then
coming
towards
her
a
man
and
a
woman
the
woman
was
ordinary
enough
a
prim
stiffly
dressed
person
with
a
pale
shy
face
timid
in
her
walk
and
depressed
in
mouth
and
eyes
the
man
was
a
stout
short
fellow
with
a
rosy
smiling
face
at
once
maggie
noticed
his
smile
he
was
dressed
very
smartly
in
a
black
coat
and
and
trousers
his
bowler
was
cocked
a
little
to
one
side
she
passed
them
and
the
little
round
man
looking
her
full
in
the
face
smiled
so
happily
and
with
so
radiant
an
amiability
that
she
was
compelled
to
respond
the
woman
did
not
look
at
her
long
after
she
had
left
them
she
thought
of
the
little
man
smile
there
was
something
that
in
spite
of
herself
reminded
her
both
of
uncle
mathew
and
martin
she
felt
a
sudden
and
warm
kinship
something
that
she
had
not
known
since
her
arrival
in
skeaton
had
she
not
struggled
with
herself
every
kind
of
reminiscence
of
her
london
life
would
have
come
crowding
about
her
this
meeting
was
like
the
first
little
warning
tap
upon
the
wall
on
her
return
she
spoke
of
it
oh
said
paul
that
must
have
been
poor
little
toms
with
his
sister
poor
asked
maggie
yes
he
queer
in
his
head
you
know
said
paul
quite
harmless
but
he
has
the
strangest
ideas
maggie
noticed
then
that
grace
shivered
and
the
whole
of
her
face
worked
with
an
odd
emotion
of
horror
and
disgust
he
should
have
been
shut
up
somewhere
she
said
it
disgraceful
letting
him
walk
about
everywhere
just
like
any
one
else
shut
up
cried
maggie
oh
no
i
do
think
any
one
ought
to
be
shut
up
for
anything
my
dear
maggie
said
paul
in
his
fatherly
protecting
voice
no
prisons
think
what
would
become
of
us
all
oh
said
maggie
impatiently
i
not
practical
of
course
i
know
what
one
should
do
but
i
do
know
that
no
one
should
be
shut
up
said
grace
now
this
chut
chut
may
seem
a
very
little
thing
but
very
little
things
are
sometimes
of
great
importance
marriages
have
been
wrecked
on
an
irritating
cough
and
happy
homes
ruined
by
a
shuffle
grace
had
said
chut
chut
for
a
great
many
years
and
to
many
people
it
expressed
scorn
and
contempt
and
implied
a
vast
store
of
superior
knowledge
grace
herself
had
no
idea
of
the
irritating
nature
of
this
exclamation
she
would
have
been
entirely
amazed
did
you
explain
to
her
that
it
had
more
to
do
with
her
unpopularity
in
skeaton
than
any
other
thing
she
had
even
said
chut
chut
to
constantine
but
she
said
it
to
maggie
more
than
to
any
other
person
when
she
had
been
in
the
house
a
few
days
she
said
to
her
brother
paul
maggie
much
younger
than
i
had
supposed
oh
do
you
think
so
said
paul
yes
i
do
she
knows
nothing
about
anything
she
been
nowhere
seen
nobody
poor
child
it
was
the
poor
child
position
that
she
now
during
these
first
weeks
adopted
she
was
very
very
kind
to
maggie
as
she
explained
to
maxse
she
really
was
very
fond
of
her
she
was
a
good
girl
at
the
same
time
well
maxse
would
understand
that
paul
can
hardly
have
known
what
he
was
marrying
ignorance
carelessness
strange
ideas
some
one
from
the
centre
of
africa
would
have
known
more
and
so
on
nevertheless
she
was
a
good
girl
only
she
needed
guidance
fancy
she
had
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
poor
toms
proposed
to
call
on
his
sister
well
one
could
help
that
miss
toms
was
a
regular
communicant
nevertheless
she
did
realise
that
was
it
of
course
she
had
known
all
kinds
of
queer
people
in
london
paul
and
grace
had
rescued
her
the
strangest
people
no
maggie
was
an
orphan
she
had
an
uncle
grace
believed
and
two
aunts
who
belonged
to
a
strange
sect
sex
no
sect
very
queer
altogether
maxse
went
home
greatly
impressed
the
girl
undoubtedly
queer
she
told
her
husband
the
parson
got
a
queer
sort
of
wife
colonel
maxse
told
his
friends
in
the
skeaton
conservative
club
he
rescued
her
from
some
odd
sort
of
life
in
london
no
do
know
what
it
was
exactly
always
was
a
bit
soft
trenchard
maggie
had
no
idea
that
skeaton
was
discussing
her
she
judged
other
people
by
herself
meanwhile
something
occurred
that
gave
her
quite
enough
to
think
about
she
had
understood
from
grace
that
it
was
expected
of
her
that
she
should
be
at
home
on
one
afternoon
in
the
week
to
receive
callers
she
thought
it
a
silly
thing
that
she
should
sit
in
the
ugly
waiting
for
people
whom
she
did
not
wish
to
see
and
who
did
not
wish
to
see
her
but
she
was
told
that
it
was
one
of
her
duties
and
so
she
would
do
it
no
one
however
had
any
idea
of
the
terror
with
which
she
anticipated
these
friday
afternoons
she
had
never
been
a
very
great
talker
she
had
nothing
much
to
say
unless
to
some
one
in
whom
she
was
interested
she
was
frightened
lest
something
should
happen
to
the
tea
and
she
felt
that
they
were
all
staring
at
her
and
asking
themselves
why
her
hair
was
cut
short
and
why
her
clothes
did
fit
better
however
there
it
was
it
was
her
duty
one
friday
afternoon
she
was
sitting
alone
waiting
the
door
opened
and
the
maid
announced
purdie
maggie
remembered
that
she
had
been
told
that
alfred
purdie
was
the
richest
man
in
skeaton
that
he
had
recently
married
and
was
but
now
returned
from
his
honeymoon
purdie
entered
and
revealed
herself
as
caroline
smith
for
a
moment
as
maggie
looked
upon
that
magnificent
figure
the
room
turned
about
her
and
her
eyes
were
dim
she
remembered
as
though
some
one
were
reminding
her
from
a
long
way
off
that
caroline
had
once
told
her
that
she
was
considering
the
acceptance
of
a
rich
young
man
in
skeaton
she
remembered
that
at
the
time
she
had
thought
the
coincidence
of
caroline
and
paul
trenchard
strange
but
far
stronger
than
any
such
memory
was
the
renewed
conviction
that
she
had
that
fate
did
not
intend
to
leave
her
alone
she
was
not
to
keep
the
two
worlds
apart
she
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
forget
the
sight
of
caroline
brought
martin
before
her
so
vividly
that
she
could
have
cried
out
instead
she
stood
there
quietly
waiting
and
showed
no
sign
of
any
embarrassment
caroline
was
dressed
in
silk
and
a
little
black
hat
she
was
not
confused
in
the
least
she
seized
maggie
hand
and
shook
it
talking
all
the
time
well
now
i
sure
you
surprised
to
see
me
she
said
and
perhaps
you
not
too
glad
either
alfred
wanted
to
come
too
but
i
said
to
him
alfred
this
will
be
just
a
little
awkward
at
first
for
maggie
trenchard
got
a
grievance
and
with
some
reason
too
so
better
let
me
manage
it
alone
the
first
meeting
was
i
right
of
course
i
was
and
you
can
just
say
right
out
now
maggie
exactly
what
in
your
mind
it
not
my
fault
that
we
both
in
the
same
town
i
sure
you
much
rather
never
set
eyes
on
me
again
and
sure
i
can
quite
understand
if
you
feel
like
that
but
there
it
is
i
told
you
long
ago
in
london
that
alfred
was
after
me
and
i
was
in
two
minds
about
of
course
i
did
dream
you
were
going
to
marry
a
parson
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
less
than
a
feather
when
i
saw
it
in
the
skeaton
news
ca
be
my
margaret
cardinal
i
said
and
yet
it
seemed
so
strange
the
two
names
and
all
well
and
then
i
found
it
really
was
the
same
i
was
astonished
you
of
all
people
the
wife
of
a
parson
however
you
know
your
own
mind
best
and
i
sure
trenchard
a
very
lucky
man
so
you
can
just
start
off
and
curse
me
maggie
as
much
as
you
like
the
strange
thing
was
that
as
maggie
listened
to
this
she
felt
a
desire
to
embrace
rather
than
curse
of
course
caroline
had
done
her
harm
she
had
perhaps
ruined
martin
life
as
well
as
her
own
but
the
mistake
had
been
originally
maggie
in
trusting
caroline
with
more
confidence
than
her
volatile
nature
would
allow
her
to
hold
and
now
as
she
looked
at
caroline
and
saw
that
pretty
pink
and
white
face
the
slim
beautiful
body
the
grace
and
gaiety
and
childish
amiability
her
whole
soul
responded
here
was
a
friend
even
though
an
indiscreet
one
here
was
some
one
from
home
the
one
human
being
in
the
whole
of
skeaton
who
knew
the
old
places
and
the
old
people
the
chapel
and
the
aunts
and
martin
she
knew
at
once
that
it
would
have
been
far
safer
had
caroline
not
been
there
that
the
temptation
to
discuss
martin
would
be
irresistible
that
she
would
yield
to
it
and
that
caroline
was
in
no
way
whatever
to
be
realised
all
these
things
and
yet
she
was
glad
i
do
want
to
curse
you
caroline
said
maggie
sit
down
tea
will
be
here
in
a
minute
i
was
very
unhappy
about
what
you
did
but
all
a
long
time
ago
now
and
i
was
to
blame
too
oh
that
just
sweet
of
you
said
caroline
running
over
and
giving
maggie
an
impulsive
kiss
i
said
to
alfred
may
be
angry
i
do
know
how
she
receive
me
i
sure
she
had
the
sweetest
nature
always
and
it
is
like
her
to
bear
a
grudge
but
whatever
way
it
is
i
have
to
take
it
because
the
fact
is
i
deserve
it
but
there
you
are
simply
angelic
and
i
ever
so
glad
the
fact
is
i
was
ridicilous
in
those
days
i
do
wonder
you
lost
your
patience
with
me
and
it
was
just
like
your
honest
self
to
be
so
frank
with
me
but
marriage
has
just
taught
me
everything
what
i
say
is
every
one
ought
to
be
married
no
one
knows
anything
until
they
married
it
amazing
what
a
difference
it
makes
do
you
think
so
why
before
i
was
married
i
used
to
chatter
on
in
the
most
ridicilous
way
caroline
always
said
ridicilous
and
there
i
go
talking
of
myself
and
it
you
i
want
to
hear
about
now
maggie
tell
me
but
the
sudden
entrance
of
grace
and
paul
checked
for
the
moment
these
confidences
caroline
did
not
stay
long
this
first
time
she
talked
a
little
drank
some
tea
ate
a
biscuit
smiled
at
paul
and
departed
she
felt
perhaps
that
grace
did
not
approve
of
her
grace
had
not
seen
her
before
certainly
she
would
not
approve
of
the
dress
and
the
smile
at
paul
and
then
the
girl
talked
too
much
she
had
interrupted
grace
in
the
middle
of
one
of
her
stories
when
caroline
had
departed
after
kissing
maggie
affectionately
grace
said
and
so
you
knew
her
before
maggie
i
knew
her
in
london
said
maggie
i
like
her
said
paul
a
bright
young
creature
hum
said
grace
that
was
a
wonderful
spring
evening
the
first
spring
evening
of
the
year
the
ugly
garden
swam
in
a
mist
faintly
through
the
mist
a
pale
evening
sky
of
so
rich
a
blue
that
it
was
almost
white
was
shadowing
against
a
baby
moon
sharply
gold
the
bottles
on
the
wall
were
veiled
by
the
evening
mist
a
thrush
sang
in
the
little
bush
at
the
end
of
the
lawn
paul
whispered
to
maggie
come
out
into
the
garden
she
went
with
him
frightened
she
could
feel
his
arm
tremble
against
her
waist
his
cold
hard
fingers
caught
hers
no
current
ran
from
her
body
to
his
they
were
apart
try
as
she
may
when
they
had
walked
the
length
of
the
lawn
he
caught
her
close
to
him
put
his
hand
roughly
up
to
her
neck
and
bending
her
head
towards
his
kissed
her
she
heard
his
words
strangled
and
fierce
love
me
must
when
he
released
her
looking
back
towards
the
dark
house
she
saw
grace
standing
there
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
against
her
will
she
shared
his
feeling
of
guilt
as
like
children
caught
in
a
fault
they
turned
back
towards
the
house
chapter
v
the
battle
of
skeaton
first
year
afterwards
when
maggie
looked
back
she
was
baffled
she
tried
to
disentangle
the
events
between
that
moment
when
grace
holding
the
lamp
in
her
hand
blinked
at
them
as
they
came
across
the
lawn
and
that
other
most
awful
moment
when
in
paul
study
grace
declared
final
and
irrevocable
war
between
those
two
events
ran
the
history
of
more
than
two
years
and
there
was
nothing
stranger
than
the
way
that
the
scene
in
the
garden
and
the
scene
in
the
study
seemed
to
maggie
to
be
close
together
what
were
the
steps
she
used
to
ask
herself
afterwards
that
led
to
those
last
months
of
fury
and
tragedy
and
disaster
was
it
my
fault
was
it
hers
was
it
paul
what
happened
if
i
had
not
done
this
or
that
if
grace
had
not
said
no
it
was
hopeless
she
would
break
off
in
despair
isolated
scenes
appeared
before
her
always
bound
on
either
side
by
that
prologue
and
that
finale
but
the
scenes
would
not
form
a
chain
she
could
not
connect
she
would
remain
until
the
end
bewildered
as
to
grace
motives
she
never
until
the
day
of
her
death
was
to
understand
grace
she
was
angry
for
such
little
things
she
said
afterwards
she
hated
me
to
be
myself
the
two
years
in
retrospect
seemed
to
have
passed
with
incredible
swiftness
the
months
that
followed
them
were
heavy
and
slow
with
trouble
but
from
the
very
first
that
is
from
the
moment
when
grace
saw
paul
kiss
maggie
in
the
evening
garden
battle
was
declared
maggie
might
not
know
it
but
it
was
grace
knew
it
very
well
it
may
be
said
however
in
grace
defence
that
she
gave
maggie
every
chance
she
marvelled
at
her
own
patience
for
two
years
after
that
moment
when
she
decided
that
maggie
was
queer
and
that
her
beloved
paul
was
in
real
danger
of
his
losing
his
soul
because
of
that
queerness
she
held
her
hand
she
was
not
naturally
a
patient
was
not
introspective
enough
to
be
that
and
she
held
no
brief
for
maggie
nevertheless
for
two
whole
years
she
held
her
hand
they
were
all
three
in
that
ugly
house
figures
moving
in
the
dark
grace
simply
knew
as
the
months
passed
that
she
disliked
and
feared
maggie
more
and
more
paul
knew
that
as
the
months
passed
well
what
he
knew
will
appear
in
the
following
pages
and
maggie
she
only
knew
that
it
needed
all
her
endurance
and
stubborn
will
to
force
herself
to
accept
this
life
as
her
life
she
must
to
give
way
meant
to
run
away
and
to
run
away
meant
to
long
for
what
she
could
not
have
and
loneliness
and
defeat
she
would
make
this
into
a
success
she
would
care
for
paul
although
she
could
not
give
him
all
that
he
needed
she
would
and
she
could
every
morning
as
she
lay
awake
in
the
big
with
the
brass
knobs
at
the
winking
at
her
in
the
early
light
she
vowed
that
she
would
justify
her
acceptance
of
the
man
who
lay
sleeping
so
peacefully
beside
her
poor
child
her
battle
with
grace
was
to
teach
her
how
far
her
will
and
endurance
could
carry
her
grace
on
her
side
was
not
a
bad
woman
she
was
simply
a
stupid
one
she
disliked
maggie
for
what
seemed
to
her
most
admirable
reasons
and
as
that
dislike
slowly
slowly
turned
into
hatred
her
only
hardened
until
that
moment
when
she
saw
a
faded
patch
of
on
the
wall
instead
of
her
mother
portrait
she
had
no
doubts
whatever
about
the
success
of
what
she
considered
her
choice
maggie
was
a
dear
young
ignorant
helpless
but
the
very
wife
for
paul
then
slowly
slowly
the
picture
changed
maggie
was
obstinate
maggie
was
careless
maggie
was
selfish
idle
lazy
irreligious
at
last
maggie
was
queer
then
when
in
the
dusk
of
that
summer
evening
she
saw
paul
kiss
maggie
as
the
moths
blundered
about
her
lamp
her
stolid
unimaginative
heart
was
terrified
this
girl
who
was
she
what
had
she
been
before
they
found
her
what
was
this
strange
passion
in
paul
isolating
him
from
her
his
sister
this
girl
was
dangerous
to
them
heathen
they
had
made
a
terrible
mistake
paul
had
been
from
the
first
bewitched
by
some
strange
spell
and
she
his
sister
had
aided
the
witch
and
yet
to
her
credit
be
it
remembered
for
two
years
she
fought
her
fears
superstitions
jealousies
angers
that
can
have
been
no
easy
thing
for
a
woman
who
had
always
had
her
own
way
but
maggie
helped
her
there
were
many
days
during
that
first
year
at
any
rate
when
grace
thought
that
the
girl
was
after
all
only
the
simple
harmless
child
that
she
had
first
found
her
it
was
so
transparently
clear
that
maggie
bore
no
malice
against
any
one
in
the
world
that
when
she
angered
grace
she
did
so
always
by
accident
never
by
was
only
unfortunate
that
the
accidents
should
occur
so
often
maggie
days
were
from
the
very
first
of
the
utmost
regularity
breakfast
at
then
an
interview
with
the
cook
grace
generally
in
attendance
here
then
shopping
with
grace
luncheon
at
afternoon
paying
calls
or
receiving
them
dinner
and
after
dinner
reading
a
book
while
paul
and
grace
played
bezique
or
if
paul
was
busy
upon
a
sermon
or
a
letter
he
wrote
letters
very
slowly
patience
with
grace
this
regular
day
was
varied
with
meetings
choir
practices
and
an
occasional
penny
reading
in
this
framework
of
the
year
it
would
have
appeared
that
there
was
very
little
that
could
breed
disturbance
there
were
however
little
irritations
maggie
would
have
given
a
great
deal
could
she
have
been
allowed
to
interview
the
cook
in
the
morning
alone
it
would
seem
impossible
to
an
older
person
that
grace
presence
could
so
embarrass
maggie
it
embarrassed
her
to
the
terrible
extent
of
driving
every
idea
out
of
her
head
when
maggie
had
stammered
and
hesitated
and
at
last
allowed
the
cook
to
make
a
suggestion
grace
would
say
you
must
leave
it
all
to
cook
dear
now
what
about
a
nice
shepherd
pie
the
cook
who
hated
grace
would
toss
her
head
impossible
mum
quite
impossible
oh
do
you
think
so
maggie
would
say
this
was
the
cook
opportunity
well
for
you
mum
i
see
if
it
ca
be
managed
difficult
as
it
is
grace
anger
boiled
over
that
woman
must
go
she
insisted
very
well
said
maggie
cook
after
cook
appeared
and
vanished
they
all
hated
grace
you
not
very
good
at
keeping
servants
are
you
maggie
dear
said
grace
then
there
was
the
shopping
grace
conversation
was
the
real
trouble
here
grace
stories
had
seemed
rather
a
joke
in
london
soon
in
skeaton
they
became
a
torture
from
the
vicarage
to
the
high
street
was
not
far
but
it
was
far
enough
for
grace
narrative
powers
to
stretch
their
legs
and
get
a
healthy
appetite
for
the
day
work
grace
walked
very
slowly
because
of
her
painful
breathing
her
stout
stolid
figure
in
its
stiff
clothes
the
skirt
rather
short
thick
legs
in
black
stockings
and
large
flat
boots
marched
along
she
had
a
peculiar
walk
planting
each
foot
on
the
ground
with
deliberate
determination
as
though
she
were
squashing
a
malignant
beetle
she
was
rather
but
did
not
wear
glasses
because
as
she
said
to
maggie
one
need
not
look
peculiar
until
one
must
her
favourite
was
a
black
straw
hat
with
a
rather
faded
black
ribbon
and
a
huge
pin
stuck
into
it
this
pin
was
like
a
dagger
she
peered
around
her
as
she
walked
and
for
ever
enquired
of
maggie
who
that
was
on
the
other
bide
of
the
road
maggie
of
course
did
not
know
and
there
began
then
a
long
as
to
colour
clothes
height
smile
or
frown
nothing
was
too
small
to
catch
interest
but
nothing
caught
it
for
long
maggie
at
the
end
of
her
walk
felt
as
though
she
were
beset
by
a
whirl
of
little
buzzing
flies
she
noticed
that
paul
had
from
long
habit
learnt
to
continue
his
own
thoughts
during
grace
stories
and
she
also
tried
to
do
this
but
she
was
not
clever
at
it
because
grace
would
suddenly
stop
and
say
where
was
i
maggie
and
then
when
maggie
was
confused
regard
her
suspiciously
narrowing
her
eyes
into
little
thin
points
the
shopping
was
difficult
because
grace
would
stand
at
maggie
elbow
and
say
now
maggie
this
is
your
affair
is
it
you
decide
what
you
want
and
then
when
maggie
had
decided
grace
simply
to
show
her
power
would
say
oh
i
do
think
we
better
have
that
no
i
think
we
have
that
will
you
show
us
something
else
please
so
they
had
to
begin
all
over
again
nevertheless
throughout
their
first
summer
maggie
was
almost
happy
not
quite
happy
some
silent
but
persistent
rebellion
at
the
very
centre
of
her
heart
prevented
her
complete
happiness
what
she
really
felt
was
that
half
of
rebellious
questioning
passionate
half
of
asleep
and
that
at
all
costs
whatever
occurred
she
must
keep
it
asleep
that
was
her
real
definite
memory
of
her
first
through
it
all
she
was
wilfully
deliberately
drugged
every
one
thought
paul
very
strange
that
summer
flaunders
the
curate
told
miss
purves
that
he
was
very
odd
he
was
always
the
most
tranquil
sunny
nature
as
you
know
miss
purves
well
now
i
assure
you
he
never
the
same
from
one
minute
to
another
his
temper
is
most
uncertain
and
one
never
can
tell
of
what
he
thinking
you
know
he
took
the
collects
in
the
wrong
order
last
sunday
and
last
night
he
read
the
wrong
lesson
two
days
ago
he
was
quite
angry
with
me
because
i
suggested
another
tune
for
kindly
himself
unlike
himself
to
what
do
you
attribute
this
mr
flaunders
said
miss
purves
you
know
our
vicar
so
well
i
sure
i
ca
tell
what
it
is
said
flaunders
sighing
can
it
be
his
marriage
said
miss
purves
i
sure
said
flaunders
flushing
that
it
can
be
nothing
to
do
with
trenchard
that
a
fine
woman
miss
purves
a
fine
woman
she
seems
a
little
strange
said
miss
purves
why
does
she
let
her
hair
grow
it
hardly
christian
as
it
is
it
her
health
i
expect
said
flaunders
paul
was
very
gentle
and
good
to
maggie
all
that
summer
better
to
her
than
any
human
being
had
ever
been
before
she
became
very
fond
of
him
and
yet
it
was
not
apparently
her
affection
that
he
wanted
he
seemed
to
be
for
ever
on
the
verge
of
asking
her
some
question
and
then
checking
himself
he
was
suddenly
silent
she
caught
him
looking
at
her
in
odd
furtive
ways
he
made
love
to
her
and
then
suddenly
checked
himself
going
off
leaving
her
alone
during
these
months
she
did
everything
she
could
for
him
she
knew
that
she
was
not
satisfying
him
because
she
could
give
him
only
affection
and
not
love
but
everything
that
he
wanted
her
to
do
she
did
and
they
never
through
all
those
summer
months
had
one
direct
honest
conversation
they
were
afraid
she
began
to
see
very
clearly
his
faults
his
whole
nature
was
easy
genial
and
above
all
lazy
he
liked
to
be
liked
and
she
was
often
astonished
at
the
pleasure
with
which
he
received
compliments
he
had
a
conceit
of
himself
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
clergyman
and
she
knew
that
nothing
pleased
him
so
much
as
when
people
praised
his
humanity
she
saw
him
as
she
called
it
that
is
bringing
forward
a
succession
of
little
tricks
a
jolly
laugh
an
enthusiastic
opinion
a
pretence
of
humility
a
air
all
things
not
very
bad
in
themselves
but
put
on
many
years
ago
subconsciously
as
an
actor
puts
on
powder
and
paint
she
saw
that
he
was
especially
sensitive
to
lay
opinion
liked
to
be
thought
a
good
fellow
by
the
laymen
in
the
place
to
be
popular
she
was
afraid
that
he
sometimes
sacrificed
his
dignity
his
sincerity
and
his
pride
but
he
was
really
saved
in
this
by
his
laziness
he
was
in
fact
too
lazy
to
act
energetically
in
his
pursuit
of
popularity
and
the
temptation
to
sink
into
the
dirty
old
chair
in
his
study
smoke
a
pipe
and
go
to
sleep
hindered
again
and
again
his
ambition
he
had
as
so
many
clergymen
have
a
great
deal
of
the
child
in
him
a
remoteness
from
actual
life
and
a
tremendous
ignorance
of
the
brutality
and
indecency
of
things
it
had
not
been
difficult
for
grace
because
of
his
laziness
his
childishness
and
his
harmless
conceited
to
obtain
a
very
real
dominion
over
him
and
until
now
that
dominion
had
never
seriously
been
threatened
now
however
new
impulses
were
stirring
in
his
soul
maggie
saw
it
grace
saw
it
before
the
end
of
the
summer
the
whole
parish
saw
it
he
was
uneasy
dissatisfied
suffering
under
strange
moods
whose
motives
he
concealed
from
all
the
world
in
his
sleep
he
cried
maggie
name
with
a
passion
that
was
a
new
voice
in
him
when
she
awoke
and
heard
it
she
trembled
and
then
lay
very
still
and
what
a
summer
that
was
to
maggie
who
had
never
even
in
london
mingled
with
crowds
it
was
an
incredible
invasion
the
invasion
was
incredible
in
the
first
place
because
of
the
suddenness
with
which
it
fell
upon
skeaton
one
day
maggie
noticed
that
announcements
were
pasted
on
to
the
skeaton
walls
of
the
coming
of
a
pierrot
troupe
the
there
was
a
gay
picture
of
fine
beautiful
pierrettes
and
fine
stout
pierrots
all
smiling
together
in
a
then
on
another
hoarding
it
was
announced
that
the
theatre
royal
skeaton
would
shortly
start
its
summer
season
and
would
begin
with
that
famous
musical
comedy
the
girl
from
bobo
then
the
pier
theatre
put
forward
its
claim
with
a
west
end
comedy
the
royal
marine
band
announced
that
it
would
play
weather
permitting
in
the
pergola
on
the
leas
every
afternoon
other
signs
of
new
life
were
the
skeaton
rink
the
piccadilly
cinema
concerts
in
the
town
hall
and
popular
lectures
in
the
skeaton
institute
there
was
also
a
word
here
and
there
about
wanton
bathing
machines
button
donkeys
and
milton
and
rowe
then
on
a
sunny
day
in
june
the
invasion
began
the
little
railway
by
the
sea
was
only
a
that
connected
skeaton
with
frambell
and
hooton
the
main
london
line
had
its
skeaton
station
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
and
the
station
road
to
the
beach
passed
the
vicarage
maggie
soon
learnt
to
know
the
times
when
the
excursion
trains
would
pour
their
victims
on
to
the
hot
dry
road
early
in
the
afternoon
was
one
time
and
she
would
see
them
eagerly
excitedly
hurrying
to
the
sea
fathers
and
mothers
and
babies
lovers
and
noisy
young
men
and
shrieking
girls
then
in
the
evening
she
would
see
them
return
some
cross
some
too
tired
to
speak
some
happy
and
singing
some
arguing
and
disputing
babies
hurrying
hurrying
lest
the
train
should
be
missed
at
first
she
would
not
penetrate
to
the
beach
she
understood
from
paul
and
grace
that
one
did
not
go
to
the
beach
during
the
summer
months
at
any
rate
not
the
popular
beach
there
was
merton
sand
two
miles
away
one
might
go
there
it
was
always
deserted
this
mysterious
one
fascinated
maggie
imagination
so
many
times
a
day
grace
said
oh
i
do
think
one
ought
to
maggie
heard
again
and
again
about
the
trippers
oh
one
must
keep
away
from
there
you
know
in
fact
the
skeaton
aristocracy
retired
with
shuddering
gestures
into
its
own
castle
life
became
horribly
dull
the
maxses
the
constantines
and
the
remainder
of
the
upper
ten
either
went
away
or
hid
themselves
in
their
grounds
once
or
twice
there
would
be
a
tennis
party
then
silence
this
summer
was
a
very
hot
one
the
little
garden
was
stifling
and
the
glass
bottles
cracked
in
the
sun
i
want
to
get
out
i
want
to
get
out
cried
she
went
down
to
the
sea
she
went
surreptitiously
this
was
the
first
surreptitious
thing
she
had
done
she
gazed
from
the
promenade
that
began
just
beyond
the
little
station
and
ran
the
length
of
the
town
down
upon
the
sands
the
beach
was
a
small
one
compared
with
the
great
stretches
of
merton
and
buquay
and
the
space
was
covered
now
so
thickly
with
human
beings
that
the
sand
was
scarcely
visible
it
was
a
bright
afternoon
hot
but
tempered
with
a
little
breeze
the
crowd
bathed
paddled
screamed
made
lay
sleeping
flirting
eating
out
of
paper
bags
reading
quarrelling
here
were
two
niggers
with
banjoes
then
a
stout
lady
with
a
harmonium
then
a
gentleman
drawing
pictures
on
the
sand
here
again
a
man
with
sweets
on
a
tray
here
just
below
maggie
a
funny
old
woman
with
a
little
hut
where
and
such
things
were
sold
the
noise
was
deafening
the
wind
stirred
the
sand
curiously
so
that
it
blew
up
and
about
in
little
wreaths
and
spirals
everything
and
everybody
seemed
to
be
covered
with
the
grit
of
this
fine
small
sand
it
was
in
maggie
eyes
nose
and
mouth
as
she
watched
she
hated
the
place
the
station
the
beach
the
town
and
the
woods
even
more
than
she
had
done
before
she
hated
the
place
but
she
loved
the
people
the
place
was
sneering
contemptuous
inhuman
like
some
cynical
debased
speculator
making
a
sure
profit
out
of
the
innocent
weaknesses
of
human
nature
as
she
turned
and
looked
she
could
see
the
whole
ugly
town
with
the
spire
of
church
raised
above
it
the
town
was
like
a
prison
hemmed
in
by
the
dark
woods
and
the
oily
sea
she
felt
a
sudden
terrified
consciousness
of
her
own
imprisonment
it
was
perhaps
from
that
moment
that
she
began
to
be
definitely
unhappy
in
her
own
life
that
she
realised
with
that
sudden
inspiration
that
is
given
to
us
on
occasion
how
hostile
grace
was
becoming
how
strange
and
unreal
was
paul
and
how
far
away
was
every
one
else
just
below
her
on
the
sand
a
happy
family
babies
two
little
boys
digging
the
father
smoking
his
hat
tilted
over
his
eyes
against
the
sun
the
mother
finding
biscuits
in
a
bag
for
the
youngest
infant
it
was
a
very
merry
family
and
full
of
laughter
the
youngest
baby
looked
up
and
saw
maggie
standing
all
alone
there
and
crowed
then
all
the
family
looked
up
the
boys
suspended
their
digging
father
tilted
back
his
hat
the
mother
shyly
smiled
maggie
smiled
back
and
then
overcome
by
so
poignant
a
feeling
of
loneliness
tempted
too
almost
irresistibly
to
run
down
the
steps
join
them
on
the
sand
build
castles
play
with
the
babies
she
hurried
away
lest
she
should
give
way
i
must
be
pretending
at
being
married
she
thought
to
herself
i
do
feel
married
at
all
i
not
natural
if
i
were
sitting
on
the
sand
digging
i
be
quite
natural
no
wonder
grace
thinks
me
tiresome
but
how
does
one
get
older
and
grown
up
what
is
one
to
do
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
go
down
to
the
sands
again
that
summer
the
autumn
came
the
woods
turned
to
gold
the
sea
was
flurried
with
rain
and
the
church
began
to
fill
the
horizon
the
autumn
and
the
winter
were
the
times
of
the
church
high
festival
paul
as
though
he
were
aware
that
he
had
during
these
last
months
been
hovering
about
strange
places
and
peering
into
dark
windows
busied
himself
about
the
affairs
of
his
parish
with
an
energy
that
surprised
every
one
maggie
was
aware
of
a
number
of
young
women
of
whom
before
she
had
been
unconscious
miss
carmichael
misses
mary
and
jane
bethel
miss
clarice
hendon
miss
polly
jones
some
of
these
pretty
girls
all
of
them
terribly
modern
strident
scornful
it
seemed
to
maggie
at
first
she
was
frightened
of
them
as
she
had
never
been
frightened
of
any
one
before
they
did
look
at
her
of
course
as
though
they
thought
her
strange
and
then
they
soon
discovered
that
she
knew
nothing
at
all
about
life
their
two
chief
employments
woven
in
as
it
were
to
the
web
of
their
church
assistance
were
love
and
broken
engagements
refusals
acceptances
and
on
the
other
hand
jokes
about
everybody
and
everything
maggie
soon
discovered
that
grace
was
one
of
their
favourite
aunt
sallies
this
made
her
very
angry
and
she
showed
so
plainly
her
indignation
on
the
first
occasion
of
their
wit
that
they
never
laughed
at
grace
in
maggie
presence
again
maggie
felt
after
this
very
tender
and
sympathetic
towards
grace
until
she
discovered
that
her
good
was
quite
unaware
that
any
one
laughed
at
her
and
would
have
refused
to
believe
it
had
she
been
told
at
the
same
time
there
went
strangely
with
this
confidence
an
odd
perpetual
suspicion
grace
was
for
ever
on
guard
against
laughter
and
nothing
made
her
more
indignant
than
to
come
into
a
room
and
see
that
people
suddenly
ceased
their
conversation
maggie
however
did
try
this
autumn
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
grace
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
the
little
things
that
were
against
the
friendliness
rather
than
the
big
ones
how
she
seriously
blamed
herself
for
an
irritation
that
was
really
childish
who
for
instance
a
grown
woman
and
married
could
do
other
than
blame
herself
for
being
irritated
by
grace
habit
of
not
finishing
her
sentences
grace
would
say
maggie
did
you
remember
well
it
does
matter
remember
what
grace
no
really
it
does
matter
it
was
only
that
but
grace
do
tell
me
because
otherwise
you
be
blaming
me
for
something
i
ought
to
have
done
blaming
you
why
maggie
to
hear
you
talk
any
one
would
think
that
i
was
always
scolding
you
of
course
if
that
what
you
feel
no
no
i
do
but
i
so
careless
i
forget
things
so
i
do
want
to
forget
something
that
i
ought
to
do
yes
you
are
careless
maggie
that
quite
true
it
one
of
your
faults
strange
how
willing
we
are
ourselves
to
admit
a
fault
and
irritated
when
a
friend
agrees
about
it
with
us
oh
i
not
always
careless
said
maggie
often
you
are
dear
are
you
you
must
learn
i
sure
improve
in
time
i
wonder
no
i
decided
i
would
bother
did
i
still
perhaps
after
all
no
i
daresay
it
wiser
to
leave
it
alone
another
little
thing
that
the
autumn
emphasised
was
grace
inability
to
discover
when
a
complaint
or
a
remonstrance
was
decently
deceased
one
evening
paul
going
out
in
a
hurry
asked
maggie
to
give
grace
the
message
that
evensong
would
be
at
instead
of
that
day
maggie
forgot
to
give
the
message
and
grace
arrived
at
the
church
during
the
reading
of
the
second
lesson
oh
grace
i
so
sorry
said
maggie
it
does
matter
said
grace
but
how
you
could
forget
maggie
is
so
strange
do
try
not
to
forget
things
i
know
it
worries
paul
for
myself
i
do
care
although
i
do
value
punctuality
and
memory
i
do
indeed
what
i
mean
is
that
it
is
for
my
own
happiness
that
i
mind
i
do
want
to
forget
said
maggie
one
would
think
to
hear
you
grace
that
you
imagine
i
like
forgetting
really
maggie
said
grace
i
do
think
that
quite
the
way
to
speak
to
me
and
again
and
again
throughout
the
long
winter
this
little
episode
figured
you
remember
to
be
punctual
wo
you
maggie
not
like
the
time
when
you
forgot
to
tell
me
you
forgive
me
reminding
you
maggie
but
i
did
want
it
to
be
like
the
time
you
forgot
to
give
me
oh
you
better
not
trust
to
maggie
paul
only
the
other
day
when
you
gave
her
the
message
about
evensong
grace
meant
no
harm
by
this
her
mind
moved
slowly
and
was
entangled
by
a
vast
quantity
of
useless
lumber
she
was
really
shocked
by
carelessness
and
inaccuracy
because
she
was
radically
careless
and
inaccurate
herself
but
did
know
it
if
there
one
thing
i
value
it
order
she
would
say
but
in
struggling
to
remember
superficial
things
she
forgot
all
essentials
her
brain
moved
just
half
as
slowly
as
everything
else
that
winter
was
warm
and
muggy
with
continuous
showers
of
warm
rain
that
seamed
to
change
into
mud
in
the
air
as
it
fell
the
church
was
filled
with
the
clammy
mist
of
its
central
heating
maggie
as
she
sat
through
service
after
service
watched
one
headache
race
after
another
the
air
was
full
of
headache
she
asked
once
that
a
window
might
be
kept
open
that
would
mean
death
in
skeaton
you
understand
the
skeaton
air
said
grace
that
because
i
do
get
enough
of
it
said
maggie
she
found
herself
looking
back
to
the
chapel
services
with
wistful
regret
what
had
there
been
there
that
was
not
here
here
everything
was
ordered
arranged
in
decent
sequence
in
regular
symmetry
and
progression
and
yet
no
one
seemed
to
maggie
to
listen
to
what
they
were
saying
and
no
one
thought
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
they
used
and
if
they
did
of
what
use
would
it
be
the
affair
was
all
settled
heaven
was
arrayed
parcelled
out
its
very
streets
and
courts
mapped
and
described
it
was
the
destination
of
every
one
in
the
building
as
surely
as
though
they
were
travelling
to
london
by
the
morning
express
they
were
sated
with
knowledge
of
their
destiny
no
curiosity
no
wonder
no
agitation
no
fear
even
the
words
of
the
most
beautiful
prayers
had
ceased
to
have
any
meaning
because
the
matter
had
been
settled
so
long
ago
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
how
that
chapel
had
throbbed
with
expectation
with
amaze
with
curiosity
with
struggle
foolish
much
of
it
perhaps
stifling
it
had
seemed
then
in
its
superstition
maggie
had
been
afraid
then
so
afraid
that
she
could
not
sleep
at
nights
how
she
longed
now
for
that
fear
to
return
to
her
at
this
point
she
would
discover
that
she
was
beckoning
back
to
her
the
figures
of
that
other
world
they
must
not
come
the
two
worlds
must
not
join
or
she
was
lost
she
turned
her
back
from
her
memories
and
her
desires
during
this
winter
there
were
the
two
affairs
of
toms
and
caroline
maggie
carried
out
her
resolve
of
calling
on
toms
she
did
it
one
dark
afternoon
a
few
days
before
christmas
moved
it
must
be
confessed
partly
by
a
sense
of
exasperation
with
grace
grace
had
been
that
day
quite
especially
tiresome
she
had
a
cold
and
a
new
evening
dress
had
cost
twice
as
much
as
it
ought
to
have
done
mitch
had
broken
into
eczema
and
constantine
had
overruled
her
at
a
committee
meeting
with
a
flood
of
disconnected
talk
she
had
overwhelmed
maggie
until
the
girl
felt
as
though
her
head
had
been
thrust
into
a
bag
of
flour
through
it
all
there
had
been
an
undercurrent
of
complaint
as
though
maggie
were
responsible
early
in
the
afternoon
grace
declared
that
her
head
was
splitting
and
retired
to
her
bedroom
maggie
in
a
state
of
blinded
and
deafened
exasperation
remembered
toms
and
decided
to
call
on
him
she
found
a
neat
little
house
standing
in
a
neat
little
garden
near
the
sea
just
beyond
the
end
of
the
promenade
or
the
leas
as
the
real
skeatonian
always
called
it
miss
toms
and
toms
were
sitting
in
a
very
small
room
with
a
large
fire
a
pale
grey
wallpaper
and
a
number
of
wooden
toys
arranged
on
a
shelf
running
round
the
room
the
toys
were
of
all
kinds
a
farm
cows
and
sheep
tigers
and
lions
soldiers
and
cannon
a
church
and
a
butcher
shop
little
green
tufted
trees
and
a
noah
ark
toms
was
sitting
neat
as
a
pin
smiling
in
an
armchair
beside
the
fire
and
miss
toms
near
him
was
reading
aloud
maggie
saw
at
once
that
her
visit
embarrassed
miss
toms
terribly
it
was
an
embarrassment
that
she
understood
perfectly
so
like
her
own
feelings
on
so
many
occasions
this
put
her
at
once
at
her
ease
and
she
was
the
old
simple
direct
maggie
her
face
eager
with
kindness
and
understanding
toms
smiled
perpetually
but
shook
hands
like
the
little
gentleman
he
was
maggie
studying
miss
toms
face
saw
that
it
was
lined
with
trouble
an
ugly
face
grave
severe
but
brave
and
proud
maggie
apologised
for
not
coming
before
i
would
have
come
she
began
oh
you
need
apologise
said
miss
toms
brusquely
they
do
call
on
us
here
and
we
do
want
them
to
they
do
call
said
toms
brightly
because
they
know
i
queer
in
the
head
and
they
afraid
i
shall
do
something
odd
they
told
you
i
was
queer
in
the
head
did
they
strangely
enough
this
statement
of
his
queerness
although
it
brought
a
lump
into
maggie
throat
did
not
disturb
or
confuse
her
yes
she
said
they
did
i
asked
who
you
were
after
i
had
seen
you
in
the
road
that
day
i
not
in
the
least
dangerous
said
toms
you
need
be
afraid
certain
things
seem
odd
to
me
that
do
seem
odd
to
other
people
that
all
the
fact
is
trenchard
said
miss
toms
speaking
very
fast
and
flushing
as
she
spoke
that
we
are
very
happy
by
ourselves
my
brother
and
i
he
is
the
greatest
friend
i
have
in
the
world
and
i
am
his
we
are
quite
sufficient
for
one
another
i
do
want
to
seem
rude
and
it
kind
of
you
to
have
come
but
it
better
to
leave
us
alone
it
is
indeed
well
i
do
know
bald
maggie
smiling
you
see
i
a
little
queer
myself
at
least
i
think
that
most
of
the
people
here
are
coming
to
that
conclusion
i
sure
i
more
queer
than
your
brother
at
any
rate
i
ca
do
you
any
harm
and
we
may
as
well
give
it
a
trial
may
we
toms
clapped
his
hands
with
so
sudden
a
noise
that
maggie
jumped
that
right
he
said
that
the
way
i
like
to
hear
people
talk
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
and
we
judge
for
ourselves
his
voice
was
very
soft
and
pleasant
the
only
thing
at
all
strange
about
him
was
his
smile
that
came
and
went
like
the
ripple
of
firelight
on
the
wall
you
like
to
know
all
about
us
would
you
well
until
ten
years
ago
i
was
selling
corn
in
the
city
such
a
waste
of
time
but
i
took
it
very
seriously
then
and
worked
worked
worked
i
worked
too
hard
you
know
much
too
hard
and
then
i
was
ill
ill
for
a
long
time
when
i
was
better
corn
did
seem
to
be
of
any
importance
and
people
thought
that
very
odd
of
me
i
was
confused
sometimes
and
called
people
by
their
wrong
names
and
sometimes
i
said
what
was
in
my
head
instead
of
saying
what
was
in
my
stomach
every
one
thought
it
very
odd
and
if
my
dear
sister
had
come
to
the
rescue
they
would
have
locked
me
up
they
would
indeed
shut
me
up
and
never
let
me
walk
about
all
because
i
did
care
for
corn
any
more
he
laughed
his
little
chuckling
laugh
but
we
beat
them
did
we
dorothy
yes
we
did
and
here
we
are
now
you
tell
us
your
history
miss
toms
had
been
watching
maggie
face
intently
while
her
brother
spoke
and
the
clear
steady
candour
of
maggie
eyes
and
her
calm
acceptance
of
all
that
the
little
man
said
must
have
been
reassuring
now
jim
she
said
do
bother
trenchard
you
ca
expect
her
to
tell
us
her
history
when
she
calling
for
the
first
time
why
not
expect
me
to
said
maggie
i
got
no
history
i
lived
in
glebeshire
most
of
my
life
with
my
father
who
was
a
clergyman
then
he
died
and
i
lived
with
two
aunts
in
london
then
i
met
paul
and
he
married
me
and
here
i
am
that
not
history
said
toms
a
little
impatiently
however
i
wo
bother
you
now
you
only
a
child
i
see
and
i
very
glad
to
see
it
i
do
like
grown
up
people
how
do
you
like
skeaton
asked
miss
toms
speaking
more
graciously
than
she
had
done
oh
i
shall
like
it
i
expect
said
maggie
at
least
i
shall
like
the
people
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
like
the
place
the
sand
blows
about
and
i
do
like
the
woods
yes
they
greasy
are
they
said
toms
and
full
of
little
flies
and
the
trees
are
dark
and
never
cool
they
talked
a
little
while
longer
and
then
maggie
got
up
to
say
when
she
took
tom
hand
and
felt
his
warm
confident
pressure
and
saw
his
large
trusting
eyes
looking
into
hers
she
felt
a
warmth
of
friendliness
also
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
known
him
all
her
life
miss
toms
came
with
her
to
the
door
they
looked
out
into
the
dark
the
sea
rustled
close
at
hand
far
on
the
horizon
a
red
light
was
burning
as
though
it
were
a
great
fire
they
could
hear
the
wave
break
on
the
beach
and
sigh
in
the
darkness
as
it
withdrew
i
shall
come
again
said
maggie
do
you
be
too
sure
said
miss
toms
we
shall
quite
understand
if
you
do
come
and
we
sha
think
the
worse
of
you
public
opinion
here
is
very
strong
they
do
want
to
be
unkind
to
jim
but
they
think
he
ought
to
be
shut
up
shut
up
maggie
could
feel
that
she
was
quivering
shut
up
maggie
tossed
her
head
anyway
they
have
shut
me
up
yet
she
said
well
said
miss
toms
after
a
little
pause
in
which
she
appeared
to
be
struggling
to
say
more
she
told
grace
and
paul
at
supper
that
night
that
she
had
been
to
see
the
toms
she
saw
grace
struggling
not
to
show
her
disapproval
and
thought
it
was
nice
of
her
do
you
really
think
said
grace
oh
perhaps
after
all
paul
said
maggie
do
you
not
want
me
to
see
the
toms
paul
was
distressed
no
it
is
that
miss
toms
is
a
very
nice
woman
only
you
think
it
not
natural
of
me
to
take
an
interest
in
some
one
a
little
off
his
head
like
mr
toms
well
dear
perhaps
there
is
something
maggie
laughed
i
a
little
off
my
head
too
oh
you
need
look
so
shocked
grace
you
know
you
think
it
and
every
one
else
here
thinks
it
too
now
grace
confess
you
beginning
to
be
horrified
that
paul
married
me
please
maggie
said
paul
who
hated
scenes
grace
was
always
flushed
by
a
direct
attack
her
eyes
gazed
in
despair
about
her
while
she
plunged
about
in
her
mind
maggie
you
must
say
such
things
no
you
must
of
course
true
that
you
got
more
to
learn
than
i
thought
you
are
careless
dear
are
you
you
remember
yesterday
that
you
promised
to
look
in
at
pettits
and
get
a
reel
of
cotton
and
then
of
course
toms
is
a
good
little
man
every
one
says
so
but
at
the
same
time
he
queer
you
must
admit
that
maggie
indeed
it
was
really
very
long
ago
that
he
asked
maxse
in
the
high
street
to
take
all
her
clothes
off
so
that
he
could
see
what
she
was
really
made
of
now
that
is
nice
maggie
it
odd
you
ca
deny
it
and
if
you
only
told
me
that
you
had
been
to
pettits
i
could
have
gone
later
myself
if
it
is
one
thing
said
maggie
it
another
i
may
be
a
child
and
careless
and
not
be
educated
and
have
strange
ideas
but
if
you
thought
grace
that
it
was
going
to
be
just
the
same
after
paul
was
married
as
before
you
were
mistaken
three
a
difficult
number
to
manage
you
know
oh
if
you
mean
said
grace
crimsoning
that
i
better
away
that
i
should
live
somewhere
else
please
say
so
openly
i
hate
this
hinting
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
can
leave
my
dear
grace
said
paul
hurriedly
whoever
thought
such
a
thing
we
could
get
on
without
you
all
that
maggie
meant
was
that
it
takes
time
to
settle
down
so
it
does
that
is
all
i
meant
said
maggie
slowly
i
meant
that
i
not
just
a
child
as
you
both
think
i
got
a
life
of
my
own
and
ideas
of
my
own
i
give
way
to
you
both
in
lots
of
things
so
long
as
it
makes
you
happy
but
you
not
you
not
going
to
shut
me
up
as
you
like
to
do
to
mr
toms
perhaps
both
grace
and
paul
had
a
sharp
troubling
impression
of
having
caught
some
strange
creature
against
their
will
maggie
had
risen
from
the
table
and
stood
for
the
moment
by
the
door
facing
them
her
short
hair
standing
thick
about
her
head
contrasting
with
her
thick
white
neck
her
body
balanced
clumsily
but
with
great
strength
like
that
of
a
boy
who
has
not
yet
grown
to
his
full
maturity
she
tossed
her
head
back
in
a
way
that
she
had
and
was
gone
the
caroline
affair
was
of
another
sort
some
days
after
christmas
maggie
went
to
have
tea
with
caroline
she
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
she
felt
at
once
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
house
it
was
full
of
paintings
in
big
gold
frames
and
marble
statues
and
there
was
a
large
garden
that
had
an
artificial
look
of
having
been
painted
by
some
clever
artist
in
the
course
of
a
night
maggie
did
not
pay
a
long
visit
there
were
a
number
of
men
present
there
was
also
a
gramophone
and
after
tea
they
turned
up
the
carpet
in
the
and
danced
caroline
in
spite
of
her
noise
and
laughter
did
not
seem
to
maggie
to
be
happy
she
introduced
her
for
a
moment
to
the
master
of
the
house
a
stout
man
who
looked
as
though
he
had
lost
something
very
precious
but
was
too
sleepy
to
search
for
it
he
called
caroline
sweet
and
she
treated
him
with
patronage
and
contempt
maggie
came
away
distressed
and
she
was
not
surprised
to
hear
a
day
or
two
later
from
grace
that
purdie
was
fast
and
had
been
rude
to
constantine
one
day
early
in
the
spring
grace
announced
that
maggie
ought
not
to
go
and
see
purdie
any
more
there
are
all
sorts
of
stories
said
grace
people
say
oh
well
never
mind
they
have
dancing
on
sunday
but
she
an
old
friend
of
mine
said
maggie
you
have
others
to
think
of
beside
yourself
maggie
said
grace
and
there
is
the
church
she
an
old
friend
of
mine
repeated
maggie
her
mouth
set
obstinately
i
will
ask
paul
what
he
thinks
said
grace
please
said
maggie
her
colour
rising
into
her
cheeks
interfere
between
paul
and
me
i
speak
to
him
myself
she
did
paul
maintained
the
attitude
of
indifference
that
he
had
adopted
during
the
last
six
months
but
would
you
rather
i
did
go
asked
maggie
aggravated
you
must
use
your
judgment
said
paul
but
do
you
see
that
i
ca
leave
a
friend
just
because
people
are
saying
nasty
things
there
your
position
in
the
parish
said
paul
oh
paul
maggie
cried
do
be
so
aggravating
just
say
what
you
really
think
i
sorry
i
aggravating
said
paul
patiently
it
was
this
conversation
that
determined
maggie
she
had
been
coming
through
all
the
winter
months
to
a
resolution
she
must
be
alone
with
paul
she
must
have
things
out
with
him
as
the
months
had
gone
they
had
been
slipping
further
and
further
apart
it
had
been
paul
who
had
gradually
withdrawn
into
himself
he
had
been
kind
and
thoughtful
but
reserved
shy
embarrassed
she
understood
his
trouble
but
at
her
first
attempt
to
force
him
to
speak
he
escaped
and
placed
grace
between
them
well
this
summer
should
see
the
end
of
that
they
must
know
where
they
stood
and
for
that
they
must
be
alone
one
day
early
in
june
paul
announced
that
he
thought
of
exchanging
duties
for
the
month
of
august
with
a
wiltshire
clergyman
this
was
maggie
opportunity
finding
him
alone
in
his
study
she
attacked
paul
did
you
mean
grace
to
come
with
us
to
little
harben
in
august
of
course
dear
she
has
nowhere
else
to
go
well
she
must
come
i
given
way
about
everything
since
we
were
married
i
not
going
to
give
way
about
this
that
month
we
are
to
be
alone
alone
said
paul
but
we
always
alone
we
never
alone
said
maggie
standing
with
her
legs
apart
and
her
hands
behind
her
back
i
do
mean
to
complain
about
grace
been
very
good
to
me
i
know
and
i
got
much
to
be
grateful
for
all
the
same
she
not
coming
to
little
harben
she
got
you
all
the
rest
of
the
year
she
can
give
you
up
for
a
month
but
maggie
said
paul
no
i
quite
determined
about
this
i
may
be
a
child
and
a
fool
but
i
know
what
i
talking
about
this
time
you
not
happy
you
never
talk
to
me
as
you
used
to
there
are
many
things
we
ought
to
have
out
but
grace
is
always
there
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
you
too
tired
if
we
go
on
like
this
we
be
strangers
in
another
six
months
he
turned
round
to
stare
at
her
and
she
saw
in
his
eyes
an
odd
excited
light
maggie
he
said
in
a
low
voice
if
we
go
alone
to
little
harben
does
it
mean
that
you
think
you
can
begin
to
love
me
she
turned
her
eyes
away
i
do
know
i
do
know
about
myself
i
only
know
that
i
want
us
to
be
happy
and
i
want
us
to
be
close
together
as
we
were
before
we
were
married
it
all
gone
wrong
somehow
i
sure
it
my
fault
it
was
just
the
same
with
my
father
and
my
aunts
i
could
say
the
things
to
them
i
wanted
to
the
things
i
really
felt
and
so
i
lost
them
i
going
to
lose
you
in
the
same
way
if
i
not
careful
he
still
looked
at
her
strangely
at
last
with
a
sigh
he
turned
back
to
his
desk
i
speak
to
grace
he
said
that
night
the
storm
broke
during
supper
grace
was
very
quiet
maggie
watching
her
knew
that
paul
had
spoken
to
her
afterwards
in
the
study
the
atmosphere
was
electric
grace
read
the
church
times
paul
the
standard
maggie
longfellow
golden
legend
which
she
thought
foolish
grace
looked
up
so
i
understand
maggie
that
you
do
want
me
to
come
with
you
and
paul
this
summer
maggie
her
heart
in
spite
of
herself
thumping
in
her
breast
faced
a
grace
transfigured
by
emotion
that
countenance
heavily
flabbily
the
eyes
if
stupid
also
kind
was
now
marked
and
riven
with
a
flaming
anger
but
maggie
was
no
coward
with
her
old
gesture
of
she
stilled
her
heart
i
very
sorry
grace
she
said
but
it
only
for
a
month
i
want
to
be
alone
with
paul
grace
her
hands
fumbling
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
as
though
she
were
blind
rose
you
hated
my
being
here
maggie
all
this
time
i
seen
it
you
hated
me
you
do
know
that
you
owe
everything
to
me
that
you
could
have
managed
the
house
the
shops
the
servants
nothing
nothing
this
last
year
i
worked
my
fingers
to
the
bone
for
you
and
paul
what
do
you
think
i
get
out
of
it
nothing
it
because
i
love
paul
because
i
love
paul
but
you
hated
my
doing
things
better
than
you
you
wanted
me
to
fail
you
been
jealous
that
what
you
been
very
well
then
i
go
you
made
that
plain
enough
at
any
rate
i
leave
i
wo
wait
another
hour
and
never
forgive
you
for
this
never
you
taken
paul
away
from
me
all
i
ever
had
i
never
forgive
you
never
never
never
grace
grace
cried
paul
but
she
rushed
from
the
room
maggie
looked
at
her
husband
why
paul
she
said
you
frightened
grace
does
mean
it
she
wo
go
or
ever
there
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
his
red
cheeks
were
pale
his
hands
trembled
i
do
so
hate
quarrels
he
said
maggie
went
up
to
him
and
rather
timidly
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
we
have
a
lovely
time
at
harben
she
said
oh
i
do
want
you
to
be
happy
paul
chapter
vi
the
battle
of
skeaton
second
year
strangely
enough
maggie
felt
happier
after
this
disturbance
grace
in
the
weeks
that
followed
was
an
interesting
confusion
of
silent
and
offended
dignity
and
sudden
capitulations
because
she
had
some
news
of
fussing
interest
that
she
must
impart
nevertheless
she
was
deeply
hurt
she
was
as
tenacious
of
her
grievances
as
a
limpet
is
of
its
rock
and
she
had
never
been
so
severely
wounded
before
maggie
on
her
side
liked
grace
better
after
the
quarrel
she
had
never
really
disliked
her
she
had
only
been
irritated
by
her
she
thought
it
very
natural
of
her
to
be
angry
and
jealous
about
paul
she
was
determined
that
this
month
at
little
harben
should
put
everything
right
looking
back
over
these
past
years
she
blamed
herself
severely
she
had
been
proud
unfeeling
she
remembered
that
day
so
long
ago
at
dreot
when
aunt
anne
had
appealed
for
her
affection
and
she
had
made
no
reply
there
had
been
many
days
too
in
london
when
she
had
been
rebellious
and
hard
she
thought
of
that
night
when
aunt
anne
had
suffered
so
terribly
and
she
had
wanted
only
her
own
escape
yes
hard
and
unselfish
that
was
what
she
had
been
and
she
had
been
punished
by
losing
martin
already
here
just
as
before
in
london
she
was
complaining
and
angry
and
unsympathetic
she
did
care
for
paul
she
could
even
love
grace
if
she
would
let
her
she
would
make
everything
right
this
summer
and
try
and
be
a
better
kinder
woman
then
one
morning
she
found
a
letter
on
the
breakfast
table
she
did
not
recognise
the
handwriting
when
she
opened
it
and
saw
the
signature
at
the
end
for
a
moment
she
also
did
not
recognise
that
william
magnus
then
why
of
course
magnus
she
saw
him
standing
looking
down
at
her
with
his
mild
eyes
staring
through
his
large
spectacles
her
heart
beat
furiously
she
waited
until
breakfast
was
over
then
she
took
it
up
to
her
bedroom
the
letter
was
as
follows
dear
miss
maggie
i
know
you
are
not
miss
maggie
now
but
that
is
the
only
way
that
i
can
think
of
you
i
expect
that
you
have
quite
forgotten
me
and
perhaps
you
do
want
to
hear
from
me
but
i
must
not
lose
sight
of
you
altogether
i
have
so
many
friends
that
i
can
lose
one
without
a
word
i
do
know
quite
what
to
begin
by
telling
you
i
ought
to
ask
you
questions
about
yourself
i
suppose
but
i
know
that
your
aunts
hear
from
you
from
time
to
time
and
they
give
me
news
from
your
letters
i
hear
that
you
are
happily
married
and
are
quite
settled
down
to
your
new
life
i
very
glad
to
hear
that
although
it
is
quite
the
life
that
i
would
have
prophesied
for
you
do
you
like
skeaton
i
never
cared
much
for
seaside
resorts
myself
but
then
i
a
queer
cranky
old
man
and
i
deserve
all
i
get
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
something
cheerful
about
all
your
friends
here
but
i
afraid
i
ca
your
aunt
is
so
brave
and
plucky
that
probably
she
said
nothing
to
you
in
her
last
letter
about
how
ill
she
has
been
but
she
just
had
a
very
bad
bout
and
at
one
time
we
were
afraid
that
we
were
going
to
lose
her
you
can
imagine
how
anxious
we
all
were
but
she
is
better
again
now
although
very
much
shattered
the
chapel
is
closed
a
piece
of
news
for
you
it
never
recovered
from
poor
warlock
death
he
was
the
spirit
that
gave
it
life
and
although
he
may
have
had
his
dreams
and
imaginations
that
deceived
him
there
was
some
life
in
that
building
that
i
have
never
found
anywhere
else
and
shall
never
find
again
you
remember
that
amy
warlock
married
that
scamp
thurston
well
she
has
left
him
and
has
come
back
to
live
with
her
mother
she
had
a
rather
bad
experience
i
afraid
poor
woman
but
she
says
nothing
to
any
one
about
it
she
and
the
old
lady
have
moved
from
this
part
of
london
and
have
gone
to
live
somewhere
in
kensington
some
one
saw
martin
warlock
in
paris
the
other
day
i
hear
that
he
has
been
very
seriously
ill
and
is
greatly
changed
looking
years
older
i
can
say
now
that
you
are
happily
married
that
i
am
greatly
relieved
that
you
were
not
engaged
to
him
you
wo
think
this
presumptuous
of
a
man
old
enough
to
be
your
father
will
you
i
am
sure
he
had
many
good
things
in
him
but
he
was
very
weak
and
not
fitted
to
look
after
you
but
he
had
a
good
heart
i
sure
and
his
father
death
was
a
great
shock
to
him
thurston
i
hear
is
having
revival
meetings
up
and
down
the
country
miss
avies
i
believe
is
with
him
you
remember
miss
pyncheon
she
and
many
other
regular
attendants
at
the
chapel
have
left
this
neighbourhood
the
chapel
is
to
be
a
cinematograph
theatre
i
believe
there
i
have
given
you
all
the
gossip
i
have
not
said
more
about
your
aunts
because
i
want
you
to
come
up
one
day
to
london
when
you
have
time
and
see
them
you
will
do
that
wo
you
i
expect
you
are
very
busy
i
hope
you
are
i
would
like
to
have
a
line
from
you
but
please
do
bother
if
you
have
too
much
to
do
always
your
friend
william
magnus
when
maggie
saw
martin
name
the
other
writing
on
the
page
transformed
itself
suddenly
into
a
strange
pattern
of
webs
and
squares
nevertheless
she
pursued
her
way
through
this
but
without
her
own
agency
as
though
some
outside
person
were
reading
to
her
and
she
was
not
listening
she
repeated
the
last
words
always
your
friend
william
magnus
aloud
solemnly
twice
her
thoughts
ran
in
leaps
and
runs
across
the
flat
level
of
her
brain
martin
old
paris
those
walls
out
there
and
the
with
a
spade
little
boy
walking
with
him
chattering
it
going
to
be
hot
the
light
across
the
lawn
is
almost
blue
and
the
beds
are
dry
his
room
the
always
tilts
back
when
one
tries
to
see
one
hair
meant
to
speak
about
it
martin
paris
paris
trains
boats
how
quickly
could
one
be
there
no
time
at
all
paris
never
been
to
paris
perhaps
he
there
now
at
that
definite
picture
she
controlled
her
mind
again
she
pulled
it
up
as
a
driver
drags
back
a
restive
horse
her
first
real
thought
was
how
hard
that
this
letter
should
have
come
now
when
i
was
just
going
to
put
everything
right
with
paul
her
next
poor
paul
but
i
care
for
him
a
bit
i
do
care
for
any
one
but
martin
i
never
did
her
next
why
did
i
ever
think
i
did
and
her
next
why
did
i
ever
do
this
she
knew
with
a
strange
calm
certainty
that
from
this
moment
she
would
never
be
rid
of
martin
presence
again
she
had
maintained
for
more
than
a
year
a
wonderful
of
indifference
she
had
fancied
that
by
pushing
furiously
with
both
hands
one
could
drive
things
into
the
past
but
fate
was
cleverer
than
that
what
he
wanted
to
keep
he
kept
for
you
the
weaving
of
the
pattern
in
the
carpet
might
be
your
handiwork
but
the
final
design
was
settled
before
ever
the
carpet
was
begun
not
that
any
of
these
fine
thoughts
ever
entered
maggie
head
all
that
she
thought
was
i
love
martin
i
want
to
go
to
him
he
ill
i
got
to
do
my
duty
about
paul
she
settled
upon
that
last
point
she
bound
her
mind
around
it
fast
and
secure
like
thick
cord
she
put
magnus
letter
away
in
the
box
the
from
the
aunts
in
this
box
were
the
programme
of
the
play
that
she
had
been
to
with
martin
the
ring
with
the
three
pearls
martin
few
letters
and
some
petals
of
the
chrysanthemum
dry
and
faded
that
she
had
worn
on
the
great
day
of
the
matinee
something
had
warned
her
that
it
was
foolish
to
keep
letters
but
why
should
she
not
she
had
never
hidden
her
love
for
martin
then
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
close
beside
the
large
with
a
and
the
crucifixion
staring
down
upon
her
she
had
her
worst
hour
nothing
in
all
life
could
have
moved
her
as
did
that
picture
of
martin
loneliness
and
sickness
wave
after
wave
of
persuasion
swept
over
her
go
go
now
take
the
train
to
paris
you
can
find
out
from
magnus
where
he
was
living
he
is
sick
he
needs
you
you
swore
to
him
that
you
would
never
desert
him
and
you
have
deserted
him
they
do
want
you
here
grace
hates
you
and
paul
is
too
lazy
to
care
at
the
thought
of
paul
resolution
came
to
her
she
looked
up
at
the
rather
fat
amiable
youth
with
the
stout
legs
and
the
bare
knees
in
the
football
photograph
and
prayed
to
it
paul
i
very
lonely
and
tempted
care
for
me
even
though
i
ca
love
you
as
you
want
give
me
up
because
i
ca
let
you
have
what
some
one
else
has
got
let
be
happy
paul
please
she
was
shivering
she
looked
back
with
a
terrified
reluctant
glance
to
the
drawer
where
magnus
letter
was
then
she
went
downstairs
soon
after
they
started
for
little
harben
the
last
days
in
skeaton
had
scarcely
been
happy
ones
grace
had
erected
an
elaborate
scaffolding
of
offended
dignity
and
bitter
misery
she
was
not
bitterly
miserable
indeed
she
enjoyed
her
game
but
it
was
depressing
to
watch
paul
give
way
to
her
he
was
determined
to
leave
her
in
a
happy
mind
any
one
could
have
told
him
that
the
way
to
do
that
was
to
leave
her
alone
altogether
instead
he
petted
her
persuading
her
to
eat
her
favourite
pudding
buying
her
a
new
that
she
needed
dismissing
a
boy
from
the
choir
the
only
treble
who
was
a
treble
because
he
was
supposed
to
have
made
a
at
grace
during
he
adopted
also
a
pleading
line
with
her
now
grace
dear
do
you
think
you
could
manage
a
little
bit
more
do
you
think
you
ought
to
go
out
in
all
this
rain
grace
dear
grace
you
look
tired
to
death
shall
i
read
to
you
a
little
he
listened
to
her
stories
with
a
new
elaborate
attention
he
laughed
heartily
at
the
very
faintest
glimmer
of
a
joke
through
it
all
grace
maintained
an
unreleased
solemnity
a
mournful
superiority
a
grim
forbearance
maggie
watching
felt
with
a
sinking
heart
that
she
was
beginning
to
despise
paul
his
very
movement
as
he
hurried
to
place
a
cushion
for
grace
sent
a
little
shiver
down
her
back
oh
do
do
it
paul
she
heard
herself
cry
internally
but
she
could
say
nothing
she
had
won
her
victory
about
harben
she
could
only
now
be
silent
still
she
bore
no
grudge
at
all
against
grace
she
even
liked
her
grace
made
many
sinister
allusions
to
her
fancied
departure
ah
in
november
oh
of
course
i
shall
not
be
here
then
or
that
will
be
in
the
autumn
then
wo
it
you
better
give
it
to
some
one
who
will
be
here
at
the
time
with
every
allusion
she
scored
a
victory
it
was
evident
that
paul
was
terrified
by
the
thought
that
she
should
leave
him
he
did
not
see
what
he
would
do
without
her
his
world
would
tumble
to
pieces
but
she
has
the
remotest
intention
of
going
said
maggie
never
go
well
i
do
know
it
would
be
strange
without
her
maggie
i
must
confess
you
see
all
our
lives
we
been
together
all
our
lives
nevertheless
he
felt
perhaps
some
relief
in
spite
of
himself
when
they
were
safely
in
a
train
for
little
harben
it
was
rather
a
relief
just
for
a
day
or
two
not
to
see
grace
reproachful
face
yes
it
was
he
was
quite
gay
almost
like
the
boy
he
used
to
be
little
harben
was
one
of
the
smallest
villages
in
wiltshire
and
its
rectory
one
of
the
most
dilapidated
the
rectory
was
sunk
into
the
very
bottom
of
a
green
well
green
hills
rose
on
every
side
above
it
green
woods
pressed
in
all
around
it
a
wild
deserted
green
garden
crept
up
to
the
windows
and
clambered
about
the
old
walls
there
was
hardly
any
furniture
in
the
house
and
many
many
windows
all
without
curtains
long
reflected
the
green
garden
at
every
possible
angle
so
that
all
the
lights
and
shadows
in
the
house
were
green
there
was
a
cat
with
green
eyes
and
the
old
servant
was
so
aged
and
infirm
that
she
was
spiritually
if
not
physically
covered
with
green
moss
from
their
bedroom
they
could
see
the
long
green
slope
of
the
hill
everywhere
there
was
a
noise
of
birds
nestling
amongst
the
leaves
of
invisible
streams
running
through
the
grass
of
branches
mysteriously
cracking
and
always
in
the
distance
some
one
seemed
to
be
chopping
with
an
axe
if
you
pushed
a
window
open
multitudes
of
little
insects
fell
in
showers
about
you
all
the
roses
were
eaten
with
green
flies
what
a
place
said
maggie
nevertheless
it
was
rather
agreeable
after
the
sand
of
skeaton
during
the
first
three
days
they
preserved
their
attitude
of
friendly
distance
on
the
fourth
evening
maggie
desperately
flung
down
her
challenge
they
were
sitting
after
supper
in
the
wild
deserted
garden
it
was
a
wonderful
evening
faintly
blue
and
dim
crocus
with
flickering
silver
stars
the
last
birds
twittered
in
the
woods
the
green
arc
of
the
hill
against
the
evening
sky
had
a
great
majesty
of
repose
and
rest
now
paul
said
maggie
what
is
it
dear
but
he
slowly
changed
colour
and
looked
away
from
her
out
into
the
wood
we
got
to
face
it
some
time
she
said
the
sooner
then
the
better
face
what
he
asked
dropping
his
voice
as
though
he
were
afraid
that
some
one
would
overhear
you
and
me
maggie
gathered
her
resources
together
before
we
were
married
we
were
great
friends
you
were
the
greatest
friend
i
ever
had
except
uncle
mathew
and
now
i
do
know
what
we
are
whose
fault
is
that
he
asked
huskily
you
know
what
the
matter
is
you
do
love
me
you
never
have
have
you
he
suddenly
ended
turning
towards
her
she
saw
his
new
eagerness
and
she
was
frightened
but
she
looked
at
a
little
bunch
of
stars
that
twinkled
at
her
above
the
dark
elms
and
took
courage
i
very
bad
at
explaining
my
feelings
she
said
and
you
not
very
good
either
paul
i
know
i
am
very
fond
of
you
and
i
feel
as
though
it
ought
to
be
so
simple
if
i
were
wiser
or
kinder
i
been
thinking
for
weeks
about
this
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
ready
to
do
anything
that
will
make
you
happy
you
love
me
he
asked
i
very
fond
of
you
and
i
always
will
be
no
but
love
a
word
like
that
is
important
affection
no
it
love
i
want
she
turned
away
from
him
pressing
her
hands
together
staring
into
the
wood
that
was
sinking
into
avenues
of
dark
she
could
answer
him
he
came
over
to
her
he
knelt
on
the
dry
grass
took
her
head
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
again
she
heard
him
murmur
maggie
maggie
maggie
you
must
love
me
you
must
i
waited
so
long
i
did
know
what
love
was
god
in
his
mercy
forgive
me
for
the
thoughts
i
had
this
year
tormented
me
tantalised
me
you
a
witch
a
witch
you
so
strange
so
odd
so
unlike
any
one
you
enchanted
me
love
me
maggie
love
me
love
me
she
caught
his
words
all
broken
and
scattered
she
felt
his
heart
beating
against
her
body
and
his
hands
were
hot
to
the
touch
of
her
cold
cheek
she
felt
that
he
was
desperate
and
ashamed
and
pitiful
she
felt
above
all
else
that
she
must
respond
and
she
could
not
she
strove
to
give
him
what
he
needed
she
caught
his
hands
and
then
because
she
knew
that
she
was
acting
falsely
and
the
whole
of
her
nature
was
in
rebellion
she
drew
back
he
felt
her
withdraw
his
hands
dropped
she
burst
into
tears
suddenly
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
as
she
used
to
do
when
she
was
a
little
girl
oh
paul
she
wept
i
so
sorry
i
so
sorry
i
wicked
i
ca
he
got
up
and
stood
with
his
back
to
her
looking
towards
the
night
sky
that
flashed
now
with
stars
she
controlled
herself
feeling
desperately
that
their
whole
future
together
hung
on
the
approaching
minutes
she
went
up
to
him
standing
at
first
timidly
behind
him
then
putting
her
hand
through
his
arm
paul
it
is
so
hopeless
if
i
ca
give
you
that
i
can
give
you
everything
else
i
told
you
from
the
first
that
i
could
help
loving
martin
all
that
kind
of
love
i
gave
to
him
but
we
can
be
friends
i
want
a
friend
so
badly
if
we
both
lonely
we
can
come
together
closer
and
closer
and
perhaps
later
on
but
she
could
not
go
on
she
knew
that
she
would
never
forget
martin
that
she
would
never
love
paul
these
two
things
were
so
clear
to
her
that
she
could
not
pretend
as
the
darkness
gathered
the
wood
into
its
arms
and
the
last
twitter
of
the
birds
sank
into
silence
she
felt
that
she
too
was
being
caught
into
some
silent
blackness
the
sky
was
pale
green
the
stars
so
bright
that
the
rest
of
the
world
seemed
to
lie
in
dim
shadow
she
could
scarcely
see
paul
now
when
he
spoke
his
voice
came
disembodied
out
of
the
dusk
you
never
forget
him
then
at
last
he
asked
no
you
strange
you
do
belong
to
us
i
should
have
seen
that
at
the
beginning
i
knew
nothing
about
women
and
thought
that
all
that
i
wanted
oh
god
why
should
i
be
so
tempted
i
been
a
good
man
then
he
came
close
to
her
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
even
drew
her
to
him
i
wo
bother
you
any
more
maggie
i
conquer
this
we
be
friends
as
you
want
it
is
fair
to
you
she
felt
the
control
that
he
was
keeping
on
himself
and
she
admired
him
nevertheless
she
knew
young
though
she
was
that
if
she
let
him
go
now
she
was
losing
him
for
ever
the
strangest
pang
of
loneliness
and
isolation
seized
her
if
paul
left
her
and
martin
was
there
she
was
lonely
indeed
she
saw
quite
clearly
how
his
laziness
would
come
to
his
aid
he
would
summon
first
his
virtue
and
his
religion
and
twenty
years
of
abstinence
would
soon
reassert
their
sway
then
he
would
slip
back
into
the
old
lazy
being
that
he
had
been
before
staring
into
the
dark
wood
she
saw
it
all
she
could
completely
capture
him
by
responding
to
his
passion
without
that
she
was
too
queer
too
untidy
too
undisciplined
to
hold
him
at
all
but
she
could
not
lie
she
could
not
pretend
she
kissed
him
paul
let
be
friends
then
splendid
friends
oh
we
will
be
happy
but
as
he
kissed
her
she
knew
that
she
had
lost
him
paul
was
very
kind
to
her
during
their
stay
at
little
harben
but
they
recovered
none
of
that
old
friendship
that
had
been
theirs
before
they
married
too
many
things
were
now
between
them
by
the
end
of
that
month
maggie
longed
to
return
to
skeaton
it
was
not
only
that
she
felt
crushed
and
choked
by
the
strangling
green
that
hemmed
in
the
old
house
the
weeds
and
the
trees
and
the
plants
seemed
to
draw
in
the
night
closer
and
closer
about
the
windows
and
doors
but
also
solitude
with
paul
was
revealing
to
her
in
a
ruthless
cruel
manner
his
weaknesses
they
were
none
of
them
perhaps
very
terrible
but
she
did
not
wish
to
see
them
she
would
like
to
shut
her
eyes
to
them
all
if
she
lost
that
friendly
kindness
that
she
felt
for
him
then
indeed
she
had
lost
everything
she
felt
as
though
he
were
wilfully
trying
to
tug
it
away
from
her
why
was
it
that
she
had
never
shrunk
from
the
faults
of
martin
and
uncle
mathew
faults
so
plain
and
obvious
and
now
shrunk
from
paul
paul
were
such
little
ones
a
desire
for
praise
and
appreciation
a
readiness
to
be
cheated
into
believing
that
all
was
well
when
he
knew
that
things
were
very
wrong
an
eagerness
to
be
liked
even
by
quite
worthless
people
sloth
and
laziness
living
lies
that
were
of
no
importance
save
as
to
the
cowardice
of
his
soul
yes
cowardice
that
was
the
worst
of
all
was
it
his
religion
that
had
made
him
cowardly
why
was
maggie
so
terribly
certain
that
if
the
necessity
for
physical
defence
of
her
or
some
helpless
creature
arose
paul
would
evade
it
and
talk
about
turning
the
other
cheek
he
was
so
large
a
man
and
so
soft
a
terrific
egoist
finally
in
the
centre
of
his
soul
an
egoist
barricaded
by
superstitions
and
fears
and
lies
but
not
a
ruthless
egoist
because
that
demanded
energy
and
yet
with
all
this
he
had
so
many
good
points
he
was
a
child
a
baby
like
so
many
clergymen
even
her
father
could
have
been
defended
by
that
plea
he
was
not
radically
bad
he
was
radically
good
but
he
had
never
known
discipline
or
real
sorrow
or
hardship
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
all
his
life
spoilt
indulged
treated
by
the
world
as
men
treat
women
his
effeminacy
was
the
result
of
his
training
because
he
had
always
been
sheltered
now
his
contact
with
maggie
was
presenting
him
for
the
first
time
with
reality
would
he
face
and
grapple
with
it
or
would
he
slip
away
evade
it
and
creep
back
into
his
padded
castle
the
return
to
skeaton
and
the
winter
that
followed
it
did
not
answer
that
question
maggie
grace
and
paul
were
figures
guarded
and
defended
outwardly
friendly
grace
behaved
during
those
months
very
well
but
maggie
knew
that
this
was
a
fresh
sign
of
hostility
the
my
dear
child
and
the
rest
that
had
been
so
irritating
had
been
after
all
signs
of
intimacy
they
were
now
withdrawn
maggie
made
herself
during
that
winter
and
the
spring
that
followed
as
busy
as
possible
she
ruthlessly
forbade
all
thoughts
of
martin
of
the
aunts
of
london
she
scarcely
saw
caroline
and
the
church
was
her
fortress
she
seemed
to
be
flung
from
service
to
service
to
be
singing
in
the
choir
she
had
no
voice
asking
children
their
catechism
listening
to
paul
high
rather
strained
voice
reading
the
lessons
talking
politely
to
maxse
or
one
of
the
numerous
girls
knitting
and
sewing
always
so
badly
and
above
all
struggling
to
remember
the
things
that
she
was
for
ever
forgetting
throughout
this
period
she
was
pervaded
by
the
damp
oily
smell
of
the
heated
church
always
too
hot
always
too
close
always
too
breathless
she
had
many
headaches
she
liked
them
because
they
held
back
her
temptation
to
think
of
forbidden
things
gradually
although
she
did
not
know
it
the
impression
gained
ground
that
she
was
queer
she
had
not
been
to
the
toms
often
but
she
was
spoken
of
as
their
friend
she
had
seen
caroline
who
was
now
considered
by
the
church
a
most
scandalous
figure
scarcely
at
all
but
it
was
known
that
she
was
an
old
friend
above
all
it
was
understood
that
the
rector
and
his
wife
were
not
happy
oh
she
odd
looks
more
like
a
boy
than
a
woman
she
never
says
anything
seems
to
have
no
ideas
i
do
believe
she
religious
really
either
she
knew
nothing
of
this
she
did
not
notice
that
she
was
not
asked
often
to
other
houses
people
were
kind
the
skeaton
people
were
neither
malicious
nor
cruel
but
left
her
more
and
more
alone
she
said
to
herself
again
and
again
i
must
make
this
a
success
i
must
but
the
words
were
becoming
mechanical
it
was
like
tramping
a
treadmill
she
got
no
further
only
became
more
and
more
exhausted
that
spring
and
summer
people
noticed
her
white
face
and
strange
eyes
oh
she
a
queer
girl
they
said
the
summer
was
very
hot
with
a
little
wind
that
blew
the
sand
everywhere
strange
how
that
sand
succeeded
in
penetrating
into
the
very
depth
of
the
town
the
sand
lay
upon
the
pavement
of
the
high
street
so
that
your
feet
gritted
as
you
walked
the
woods
and
houses
lay
for
nearly
two
months
beneath
a
blazing
sun
there
was
scarcely
any
rain
the
little
garden
behind
the
rectory
was
parched
and
brown
the
laurel
bushes
were
grey
with
dust
they
saw
very
few
people
that
summer
many
of
their
friends
had
escaped
maggie
thinking
of
the
green
depths
of
harben
a
year
ago
longed
for
its
coolness
nevertheless
she
was
happy
to
think
that
she
would
never
have
to
see
harben
again
as
she
had
foretold
laziness
settled
upon
paul
what
he
loved
best
was
to
sink
into
his
old
armchair
in
the
dusty
study
and
read
old
volumes
of
temple
bar
and
the
cornhill
he
had
them
piled
at
his
side
he
read
article
after
article
about
such
subjects
as
the
silkworm
industry
and
street
signs
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
was
very
proud
of
his
sermons
but
now
he
seldom
gave
a
new
one
he
always
intended
to
do
let
any
one
disturb
me
maggie
he
would
say
at
supper
on
fridays
i
got
my
sermon
but
on
entering
the
study
he
remembered
that
there
was
an
article
in
temple
bar
that
he
must
finish
he
also
read
the
church
times
right
through
including
the
advertisements
grace
gradually
resumed
her
old
functions
she
maintained
however
an
elaborate
pretence
of
leaving
everything
to
maggie
especially
was
she
delighted
when
maggie
forgot
something
when
that
happened
she
said
nothing
her
mouth
curled
a
little
she
treated
maggie
less
and
less
to
her
garrulous
confidences
they
would
sit
for
hours
in
the
together
without
exchanging
a
word
maggie
and
paul
had
now
different
bedrooms
early
in
the
autumn
maggie
had
a
little
note
from
magnus
it
said
you
have
not
written
to
any
of
us
for
months
wo
you
come
just
for
a
night
to
see
your
aunts
at
least
let
us
know
that
you
are
happy
she
cried
that
night
in
bed
squeezing
her
head
into
the
pillow
so
that
no
one
should
hear
her
she
seemed
to
have
lost
all
her
pluck
she
must
do
something
but
what
she
did
not
know
how
to
deal
with
people
if
they
were
kind
and
friendly
there
were
so
many
things
that
she
could
do
but
this
silent
creeping
away
from
her
paralysed
her
she
remembered
how
she
had
said
to
katherine
no
one
can
make
me
unhappy
if
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
now
she
did
not
dare
to
think
how
unhappy
she
was
she
knew
that
they
all
thought
her
strange
and
odd
and
she
felt
that
strangeness
creeping
upon
her
she
must
be
odd
if
many
people
thought
her
so
she
became
terribly
wondering
whether
her
words
and
movements
were
strange
she
was
often
so
tired
that
she
could
not
drag
one
foot
after
another
a
few
weeks
before
christmas
something
happened
a
terrible
thing
perhaps
but
she
was
delivered
by
it
she
was
sitting
one
afternoon
a
few
weeks
before
christmas
in
the
alone
with
grace
it
was
her
at
home
day
a
friday
afternoon
grace
was
knitting
a
grey
stocking
a
long
one
that
curled
on
her
lap
she
knitted
badly
clumsily
twisting
her
fingers
into
odd
shapes
and
muddling
her
needles
now
and
then
she
would
look
up
as
though
she
meant
to
talk
and
then
remembering
that
it
was
maggie
who
was
opposite
to
her
she
would
purse
her
lips
and
look
down
again
the
fire
hummed
and
sputtered
the
clock
ticked
and
grace
breathed
in
heavy
despairing
pants
over
the
difficulties
of
her
work
the
door
opened
and
the
little
maid
her
eyes
nervously
wandering
towards
grace
murmured
cardinal
mum
the
next
thing
of
which
maggie
was
conscious
was
uncle
mathew
standing
clumsily
just
inside
the
door
shifting
his
bowler
hat
between
his
two
hands
the
relief
of
seeing
him
was
so
great
that
she
jumped
up
and
ran
towards
him
crying
oh
uncle
mathew
i
so
glad
at
last
he
dropped
his
bowler
in
giving
her
his
hand
she
noticed
at
once
that
he
was
looking
very
unhappy
and
had
terribly
run
to
seed
he
was
badly
shaved
his
blue
suit
was
shabby
and
soiled
he
was
fatter
and
his
whole
body
was
flabby
and
uncared
for
maggie
saw
at
once
that
he
had
been
drinking
not
very
much
but
enough
to
make
him
a
little
uncertain
on
his
feet
and
unsteady
in
his
gaze
maggie
when
she
saw
him
felt
nothing
but
a
rush
of
pity
and
desire
to
protect
him
very
strangely
she
felt
the
similarity
between
him
and
herself
nobody
wanted
either
of
them
they
must
just
love
one
another
because
there
was
no
one
else
to
love
them
she
was
aware
then
that
grace
had
risen
and
was
standing
looking
at
them
both
she
turned
round
to
her
saying
grace
this
is
my
uncle
you
heard
me
speak
of
him
have
you
he
was
very
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
uncle
this
is
my
miss
trenchard
uncle
mathew
smiled
and
rather
unsteadily
came
forward
he
caught
her
hand
in
both
his
damp
hot
ones
very
pleased
to
meet
you
miss
trenchard
i
know
you
been
very
good
to
my
little
maggie
at
least
when
i
say
little
maggie
she
not
mine
any
longer
she
belongs
to
your
brother
now
does
she
of
course
she
does
i
hope
you
well
maggie
realised
then
the
terrified
distress
in
grace
eyes
the
grey
stocking
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
grace
stared
at
uncle
mathew
in
a
kind
of
fascinated
horror
she
realised
of
course
at
once
that
he
was
what
she
would
call
tipsy
he
was
not
tipsy
but
nevertheless
tipsy
enough
for
grace
maggie
saw
her
take
in
every
detail
of
his
appearance
his
unshaven
cheeks
the
wisps
of
hair
over
the
bald
top
of
his
head
the
spots
on
his
waistcoat
the
mud
on
his
boots
and
again
as
she
watched
grace
make
this
summary
love
and
protection
for
that
unhappy
man
filled
her
heart
for
unhappy
he
was
she
saw
at
once
that
he
had
had
a
long
slide
downhill
since
his
last
visit
to
her
he
was
frightened
frightened
immediately
now
of
grace
and
the
room
and
the
physical
world
but
frightened
also
behind
these
things
at
some
spectre
all
his
own
grace
sat
down
and
tried
to
recover
herself
she
began
to
talk
in
her
society
voice
maggie
knew
that
she
was
praying
over
and
over
again
with
a
monotony
possible
only
to
the
very
stupid
that
there
would
be
no
callers
that
afternoon
and
so
you
know
glebeshire
cardinal
fancy
i
never
been
there
never
been
there
in
my
life
fancy
that
although
so
many
of
my
relations
live
there
i
once
nearly
went
down
one
wet
christmas
and
i
was
going
to
stay
with
my
aunt
but
something
happened
to
prevent
me
i
think
i
caught
a
cold
at
the
time
i
ca
quite
remember
but
fancy
you
knowing
glebeshire
so
well
all
this
came
out
in
a
voice
that
might
have
issued
from
a
gramophone
so
little
did
it
represent
grace
real
feelings
or
emotions
maggie
knew
so
well
that
inside
her
head
these
exclamations
were
rising
and
falling
what
a
horrible
man
what
a
dreadful
man
maggie
uncle
we
lost
if
any
one
calls
oh
i
do
hope
no
one
calls
it
was
obvious
meanwhile
that
mathew
was
urgently
wishing
for
a
moment
alone
with
maggie
he
looked
at
her
with
pleading
eyes
and
once
he
winked
towards
grace
he
talked
on
however
running
some
of
his
words
into
one
another
and
paying
very
little
attention
to
anything
that
grace
might
say
no
i
have
seen
my
little
niece
miss
trenchard
for
a
long
time
did
like
to
interfere
in
a
way
thought
she
ask
for
me
when
she
wanted
me
we
always
been
the
greatest
friends
a
bachelor
you
see
never
married
not
that
i
like
you
to
fancy
that
i
no
interest
in
the
other
sex
far
from
it
but
i
a
wanderer
by
nature
a
wife
in
every
port
perhaps
well
who
knows
but
lonely
at
times
one
is
indeed
a
pretty
tidy
little
place
you
got
here
yes
you
have
with
a
garden
too
paul
came
in
and
maggie
saw
him
start
as
mathew
stout
figure
surprised
him
she
felt
then
a
rush
of
hostility
against
paul
it
was
as
though
at
every
point
she
must
run
in
fiercely
to
defend
her
uncle
meanwhile
grace
worst
fears
were
realised
the
little
maid
announced
miss
purves
and
maxse
a
terrible
followed
miss
purves
as
soon
as
she
understood
that
this
strange
man
was
uncle
was
all
eager
excitement
and
uncle
mathew
bewildered
by
so
many
strangers
confused
by
a
little
unsteadiness
in
his
legs
that
would
have
been
nothing
had
he
not
been
in
a
small
room
crowded
with
furniture
finally
clasped
maxse
by
the
shoulder
in
his
endeavour
to
save
himself
from
tumbling
over
the
little
table
that
held
the
cakes
and
his
hot
heavy
hand
pressed
into
flesh
and
maxse
terrified
indeed
screamed
he
began
to
apologise
and
in
his
agitation
jerked
miss
purves
cup
of
tea
from
the
table
on
to
the
floor
after
that
he
realised
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
go
he
began
elaborate
apologies
paul
saw
him
to
the
door
he
gripped
paul
by
the
hand
i
delighted
to
have
met
you
he
said
in
full
hearing
of
the
trembling
ladies
you
given
me
such
a
good
time
give
my
little
maggie
a
good
time
too
she
not
looking
over
well
send
her
up
to
london
to
stay
with
me
for
a
bit
maggie
saw
him
to
the
gate
in
the
middle
of
the
little
drive
he
stopped
turning
towards
her
leaning
his
hands
heavily
upon
her
maggie
dear
he
said
i
in
a
bad
way
a
very
bad
way
you
desert
me
of
course
i
wo
she
answered
i
may
want
your
help
in
a
week
or
two
he
looked
dismally
about
him
at
the
thick
dull
laurel
bushes
and
the
heavy
grey
sky
i
do
like
this
place
maggie
he
said
and
all
those
women
it
religion
again
and
it
worse
than
that
chapel
you
do
seem
to
be
able
to
get
away
from
religion
you
not
happy
my
dear
yes
i
am
she
answered
firmly
no
you
not
and
i
not
but
it
will
be
all
right
in
the
end
no
doubt
you
never
desert
me
maggie
i
never
desert
you
maggie
answered
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
his
breath
she
kissed
him
eagerly
tenderly
for
a
moment
she
felt
that
she
would
go
with
him
just
as
she
was
and
leave
them
all
uncle
she
said
you
understand
how
it
is
do
you
we
have
asked
you
to
stay
if
we
known
oh
that
all
right
he
looked
at
her
mysteriously
that
new
of
yours
was
shocked
with
me
they
would
have
me
in
the
house
i
saw
that
and
i
only
had
one
glass
at
the
station
i
not
much
of
a
man
in
society
now
that
the
trouble
but
next
time
come
down
and
just
send
you
a
line
and
you
come
to
see
me
in
my
own
little
place
wo
you
i
in
the
devil
of
a
mess
maggie
that
the
truth
and
i
do
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
i
been
a
bit
of
a
fool
i
have
she
saw
the
look
of
terror
in
his
eye
again
would
some
money
she
suggested
oh
i
afraid
it
past
five
pounds
now
my
dear
he
sighed
heavily
well
i
must
be
getting
along
you
catch
your
death
of
cold
standing
out
here
we
ought
to
have
been
together
all
this
time
you
know
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
he
kissed
her
again
and
left
her
she
slowly
returned
into
the
house
curiously
he
had
made
her
happier
by
his
visit
her
pluck
returned
she
needed
it
grace
was
now
stirred
by
the
most
active
of
all
her
passions
fear
nevertheless
grace
and
paul
behaved
very
well
maggie
understood
the
shock
that
visit
must
have
given
them
she
watched
grace
imagining
the
excited
stories
that
would
flow
from
the
lips
of
miss
purves
and
maxse
she
was
determined
however
that
grace
and
paul
should
not
suffer
in
silence
and
uncle
mathew
must
be
vindicated
at
supper
that
night
she
plunged
uncle
mathew
been
very
ill
she
began
for
a
long
time
now
he
was
himself
this
afternoon
i
afraid
he
was
very
upset
at
some
news
that
he
just
had
and
then
meeting
so
many
strangers
at
once
maggie
saw
that
grace
avoided
her
eyes
i
do
think
we
discuss
it
maggie
if
you
do
mind
cardinal
was
strange
in
his
behaviour
certainly
it
was
a
pity
that
miss
purves
came
but
it
better
not
to
discuss
it
i
do
agree
said
maggie
if
you
think
that
i
ashamed
of
uncle
mathew
you
quite
wrong
he
very
unhappy
and
lonely
she
felt
her
voice
tremble
he
has
got
any
one
to
look
after
him
grace
hand
was
trembling
as
she
nervously
crumbled
her
bread
still
without
looking
at
maggie
she
said
by
the
way
you
did
the
church
flowers
this
morning
did
you
eh
maggie
turned
white
and
as
always
on
these
occasions
her
heart
thumped
leaping
as
it
seemed
into
the
very
palms
of
her
hands
but
it
was
she
began
you
remember
that
i
told
you
three
days
ago
that
it
was
to
be
this
morning
instead
of
the
usual
thursday
because
of
the
morgans
wedding
oh
grace
i
so
sorry
i
had
remembered
i
had
indeed
and
then
lucy
suddenly
having
that
chill
paul
struck
in
really
maggie
that
too
bad
no
flowers
those
others
were
quite
dead
yesterday
i
noticed
at
evensong
really
really
and
the
morgans
wedding
maggie
sat
there
trembling
i
very
sorry
she
said
almost
whispering
why
did
fate
play
against
her
why
when
she
might
have
fought
the
uncle
mathew
battle
victoriously
had
grace
suddenly
been
given
this
weapon
with
which
to
strike
i
go
and
do
them
now
she
said
i
can
take
those
flowers
out
of
the
it
done
grace
slowly
savouring
her
triumph
i
did
them
myself
this
afternoon
then
you
should
have
told
me
that
maggie
burst
out
it
not
fair
making
me
miserable
just
for
your
own
fun
you
do
know
how
you
hurt
grace
you
cruel
you
cruel
she
had
a
horrible
fear
lest
she
should
burst
into
tears
to
save
that
terrible
disaster
she
jumped
up
and
ran
out
of
the
room
hearing
behind
her
paul
admonitory
maggie
maggie
it
is
to
be
expected
that
maxse
and
miss
purves
made
the
most
of
their
story
the
rector
wife
and
a
drunken
uncle
no
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
but
it
was
true
nevertheless
christmas
passed
and
the
horrible
damp
january
days
arrived
skeaton
was
a
dripping
covering
of
emptiness
hollow
shallow
deserted
every
tree
maggie
thought
dripped
twice
as
much
as
any
other
tree
in
europe
it
remained
for
caroline
purdie
to
complete
the
situation
one
morning
at
breakfast
the
story
burst
upon
maggie
ears
grace
was
too
deeply
moved
and
excited
to
remember
her
hostility
she
poured
out
the
tale
it
appeared
that
for
many
many
months
caroline
had
not
been
the
wife
she
should
have
been
no
there
had
been
a
young
man
a
bennett
from
london
the
whole
town
had
had
its
suspicions
had
raised
its
pointing
finger
had
peeped
and
peered
and
whimpered
the
only
person
who
had
noticed
nothing
was
purdie
himself
he
must
of
course
have
seen
that
his
house
was
filled
with
noisy
young
men
and
noisier
young
women
he
must
have
realised
that
his
bills
were
high
that
champagne
was
drunk
and
cards
were
played
and
that
his
wife
attire
was
fantastically
gorgeous
at
any
rate
if
he
noticed
these
things
he
said
nothing
he
was
a
dull
silent
man
people
said
then
one
day
he
went
up
to
london
or
rather
in
the
manner
of
the
best
modern
problem
play
he
pretended
to
go
returned
abruptly
and
discovered
caroline
in
the
arms
of
bennett
he
flung
bennett
out
of
the
bedroom
window
breaking
his
leg
and
his
nose
and
that
was
why
every
one
knew
the
story
what
he
said
to
caroline
was
uncertain
he
did
not
however
pack
her
off
as
miss
purves
said
he
should
have
done
but
rather
kept
her
in
the
big
ugly
house
just
as
he
had
done
before
only
now
without
the
young
men
the
young
women
the
champagne
and
the
flowers
i
must
go
and
see
her
said
maggie
when
she
heard
this
story
grace
turned
the
strange
pale
yellow
that
was
her
colour
when
she
was
disturbed
maggie
she
said
i
warn
you
that
if
you
go
to
see
this
abandoned
woman
you
will
be
insulting
paul
and
myself
before
the
whole
town
she
is
my
friend
said
maggie
she
is
a
wicked
woman
said
grace
breathing
very
heavily
and
you
a
wicked
woman
if
you
go
to
see
her
you
have
already
made
paul
miserable
that
is
untrue
maggie
said
fiercely
it
is
i
that
have
been
miserable
not
that
it
has
been
my
own
fault
i
should
never
have
married
paul
no
you
should
not
said
grace
breathing
as
though
she
had
been
running
very
hard
and
for
that
i
was
partly
to
blame
but
fancy
what
you
done
since
you
been
with
us
just
fancy
it
terrible
never
a
greater
mistake
never
never
maggie
tossed
her
head
well
if
it
was
a
mistake
she
said
the
end
of
pretending
has
come
at
last
i
been
trying
for
nearly
two
years
now
to
go
your
way
and
paul
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
alter
myself
i
tried
and
i
ca
it
no
use
grace
we
never
get
on
i
see
it
been
hopeless
from
the
first
but
you
sha
make
paul
hate
me
you
been
trying
your
hardest
but
you
sha
succeed
i
know
that
i
stupid
and
careless
but
it
no
use
my
pretending
to
be
good
and
quiet
and
obedient
i
not
good
i
not
quiet
i
not
obedient
going
to
be
myself
now
i
going
to
have
the
friends
i
want
and
do
the
things
i
want
grace
moved
back
as
though
she
thought
that
maggie
were
going
to
strike
her
you
wicked
she
said
what
about
those
letters
in
your
drawer
you
never
loved
paul
so
you
been
opening
my
drawers
said
maggie
you
worse
than
i
grace
i
never
opened
any
one
drawers
nor
read
letters
i
should
but
it
does
matter
there
nothing
i
want
to
hide
paul
knows
all
about
it
i
not
ashamed
no
you
not
grace
eyes
were
large
with
terror
you
ashamed
at
nothing
you
made
every
one
in
the
place
laugh
at
us
ruined
paul
life
here
yes
you
have
but
you
do
care
do
you
think
i
mind
for
myself
but
i
love
paul
and
i
looked
after
him
all
his
life
and
he
was
happy
until
you
came
yes
he
was
you
made
us
all
laughed
at
you
bad
all
through
maggie
and
the
laws
of
the
church
are
anything
to
you
at
all
there
was
a
pause
maggie
a
little
calmer
realised
grace
who
had
sunk
into
a
chair
she
saw
that
stout
woman
with
the
flat
expressionless
face
and
the
dull
eyes
she
saw
the
flabby
hands
nervously
trembling
and
she
longed
suddenly
to
be
kind
and
affectionate
oh
grace
she
cried
i
know
i
been
everything
i
should
only
do
you
see
i
ca
give
up
my
friends
and
i
told
paul
before
we
married
that
i
loved
some
one
else
and
was
religious
but
perhaps
it
is
too
late
let
be
friends
i
try
harder
than
ever
before
then
she
saw
in
the
way
that
grace
shrank
back
her
eyes
staring
with
the
glazed
fascination
that
a
bird
has
for
a
snake
that
there
was
more
than
dislike
and
jealousy
here
there
was
the
wild
unreasoning
fear
that
a
child
has
for
the
dark
am
i
like
that
was
her
own
instinctive
shuddering
thought
then
almost
running
she
rushed
up
to
her
bedroom
chapter
vii
death
of
aunt
anne
maggie
after
that
flight
faced
her
empty
room
with
a
sense
of
horror
was
there
truly
then
something
awful
about
her
the
child
for
she
was
indeed
nothing
more
looked
into
her
glass
standing
on
that
she
might
peer
sufficiently
and
saw
her
face
pale
with
its
large
dark
eyes
rimmed
by
the
hair
was
she
then
awful
first
her
father
then
her
aunts
then
the
warlocks
now
grace
and
paul
not
only
dislike
but
fright
terror
alarm
her
loneliness
crushed
her
in
that
as
it
had
never
crushed
her
since
that
day
at
borhedden
she
broke
down
altogether
kneeling
by
the
bed
and
her
head
in
her
pillow
sobbing
oh
martin
i
want
you
martin
i
want
you
so
when
she
was
calmer
she
thought
of
going
down
to
paul
and
making
another
appeal
to
him
but
she
knew
that
such
an
appeal
could
only
end
in
his
asking
her
to
change
herself
begging
her
to
be
more
polite
to
grace
more
careful
and
less
forgetful
and
of
course
to
give
up
such
people
as
the
toms
and
caroline
and
then
there
would
come
after
it
all
the
question
as
to
whether
she
intended
to
behave
better
to
himself
whether
she
would
be
more
loving
more
oh
no
she
could
not
she
could
not
she
could
not
she
saw
the
impossibility
of
it
so
plainly
that
it
was
a
relief
to
her
and
she
washed
her
face
and
brushed
her
hair
and
plucked
up
courage
to
regard
herself
normally
once
more
i
not
different
she
said
to
the
there
no
reason
for
grace
to
make
faces
she
saw
that
the
breach
between
herself
and
grace
had
become
irreparable
and
that
whatever
else
happened
in
the
future
at
least
it
was
certain
that
they
would
never
be
friends
again
she
went
downstairs
prepared
to
do
battle
next
morning
she
paid
her
visit
to
caroline
it
was
a
strange
affair
the
girl
was
sitting
alone
in
her
house
her
hands
on
her
lap
looking
out
of
the
window
an
unusual
position
for
her
to
be
in
caroline
was
at
first
very
stiff
and
haughty
expecting
that
maggie
had
come
to
scold
her
i
just
looked
in
to
sec
how
you
were
said
maggie
you
might
have
come
before
answered
caroline
it
years
since
you
been
near
me
i
did
like
all
those
people
you
had
in
your
house
said
maggie
i
like
it
better
now
there
no
one
in
it
that
was
not
perhaps
very
tactful
of
her
caroline
flushed
i
could
have
them
all
here
now
if
i
wanted
to
ask
them
she
answered
angrily
well
i
very
glad
you
rather
be
without
them
said
maggie
they
were
worthy
of
you
caroline
oh
what
the
use
going
on
talking
like
this
caroline
broke
out
of
course
you
heard
all
about
everything
every
one
has
i
put
my
nose
outside
the
door
without
them
all
peering
at
me
i
hate
them
all
all
of
them
and
the
place
too
and
every
one
in
it
i
expect
you
do
said
maggie
sympathetically
nasty
cats
as
though
they
never
done
anything
wrong
all
their
days
it
was
mostly
alfred
fault
too
what
does
he
expect
when
he
leaves
me
all
alone
here
week
after
week
eating
one
heart
out
one
must
do
something
with
one
time
just
like
all
men
at
first
there
nothing
too
good
for
you
then
when
they
get
used
to
it
they
ca
be
bothered
about
anything
i
wonder
what
a
man
thinks
married
life
is
then
to
listen
to
alfred
you
think
we
were
still
living
in
the
days
of
the
good
queen
victoria
you
would
indeed
would
let
me
go
up
to
london
alone
there
a
nice
thing
for
you
and
all
because
he
did
let
me
go
once
and
i
meant
to
stay
with
mother
and
mother
was
away
so
i
had
to
sleep
at
a
hotel
why
should
i
sleep
at
a
hotel
i
not
a
baby
and
now
he
keeps
me
here
like
a
prisoner
just
as
though
i
were
in
jail
is
he
unkind
to
you
asked
maggie
no
he
is
it
his
horrible
kindness
i
ca
stand
he
divorce
me
he
wo
let
me
go
away
he
just
keeps
me
here
and
is
so
kind
and
patient
that
i
could
kill
him
i
shall
one
day
i
know
i
shall
she
stood
for
a
moment
pouting
and
looking
out
of
the
window
then
suddenly
she
turned
and
flinging
her
arms
around
maggie
burst
into
tears
oh
maggie
i
so
miserable
i
so
miserable
maggie
why
did
i
ever
come
here
why
did
i
ever
marry
i
was
so
happy
at
home
with
mother
maggie
comforted
her
persuading
her
that
all
would
soon
be
well
that
people
very
quickly
forgot
their
little
pieces
of
scandal
and
that
so
long
as
she
did
not
run
away
or
do
anything
really
desperate
all
would
come
right
maggie
discovered
that
caroline
had
escaped
from
her
crisis
with
an
increased
respect
and
even
affection
for
her
husband
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
must
be
afraid
of
her
husband
before
her
married
life
can
settle
into
any
kind
of
security
and
i
thought
you
altogether
abandoned
me
she
ended
i
was
coming
while
all
those
people
were
about
said
maggie
you
darling
cried
caroline
kissing
her
just
the
same
as
you
used
to
be
i
was
angry
i
can
tell
you
when
month
after
month
went
by
and
you
never
came
near
me
i
used
to
tell
people
when
they
asked
me
that
you
were
odd
not
a
bit
like
other
people
i
would
say
a
bit
and
it
no
use
expecting
her
to
be
she
always
been
queer
i
used
to
know
her
in
london
they
do
think
you
odd
here
darling
they
do
indeed
no
one
understands
you
so
odd
for
a
clergyman
wife
well
so
you
are
are
you
i
always
tell
them
you
had
no
bringing
up
caroline
in
fact
very
quickly
recovered
her
flow
as
soon
as
she
found
that
maggie
was
not
shocked
she
reasserted
her
old
superiority
before
the
visit
was
over
she
had
rather
despised
maggie
for
not
being
shocked
at
maggie
departure
however
she
was
very
loving
you
will
come
soon
again
darling
wo
you
it
no
use
asking
you
to
dinner
because
of
course
your
husband
wo
come
but
look
in
any
afternoon
or
we
might
go
for
a
drive
in
the
motor
maggie
on
her
return
found
grace
looking
at
the
post
in
the
hall
she
always
did
this
in
a
very
way
taking
up
the
letters
one
by
one
holding
each
very
close
to
her
eyes
and
sniffing
at
it
as
though
she
were
trying
to
read
through
the
envelope
this
always
irritated
maggie
although
her
own
letters
were
not
very
many
when
she
heard
the
hall
door
open
she
turned
and
dropped
the
letters
giving
that
especial
creaking
little
gasp
that
she
always
did
when
she
was
startled
oh
it
you
maggie
is
it
where
you
been
i
been
to
see
purdie
maggie
said
defiantly
grace
paused
as
though
she
were
going
to
speak
then
turned
on
her
heel
but
just
as
she
reached
the
door
she
said
breathing
heavily
there
a
telegram
for
you
there
maggie
saw
it
lying
on
the
table
she
picked
it
up
and
hesitated
a
wild
beating
of
the
heart
told
her
that
it
must
be
from
martin
she
did
know
what
told
her
this
except
that
now
for
so
long
she
had
been
expecting
to
see
a
telegram
lying
in
just
this
way
on
the
table
waiting
for
her
she
took
it
up
with
a
hand
that
trembled
she
tore
it
open
and
read
come
at
once
your
aunt
dying
wishes
to
see
you
magnus
no
need
to
ask
which
aunt
when
one
aunt
was
mentioned
it
was
aunt
anne
of
course
oh
poor
aunt
anne
maggie
longed
for
her
longed
to
be
with
her
longed
to
be
kind
to
her
longed
to
comfort
her
and
magnus
and
martha
and
aunt
elizabeth
and
the
cat
she
must
go
at
once
she
must
catch
a
train
after
luncheon
she
went
impetuously
into
her
husband
study
oh
paul
she
cried
aunt
anne
dying
and
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
paul
was
sitting
in
his
old
armchair
before
the
fire
he
was
wearing
faded
brown
slippers
that
flapped
at
his
heels
his
white
hair
was
tangled
his
legs
were
crossed
the
fat
broad
thighs
pressing
out
against
the
shiny
black
cloth
of
his
trousers
he
was
chuckling
over
an
instalment
of
anthony
trollope
brown
jones
and
robinson
in
a
very
ancient
cornhill
he
looked
up
maggie
you
know
it
my
interruptions
he
had
dropped
the
cornhill
but
not
fast
enough
to
hide
it
from
her
she
looked
around
at
the
dirty
untidiness
of
the
study
it
all
my
fault
this
she
thought
i
should
have
kept
him
clean
and
neat
and
keen
on
his
work
i
have
i
failed
then
her
next
thought
was
grace
would
let
me
the
study
in
fact
was
more
untidy
than
ever
the
pictures
were
back
in
their
places
whence
maggie
had
once
removed
them
husband
and
wife
looked
at
one
another
if
she
felt
i
not
managed
my
duty
he
felt
perhaps
what
a
child
she
is
after
all
but
between
them
there
was
the
gulf
of
their
past
experience
i
sorry
to
hear
that
he
said
yawning
is
she
an
old
lady
no
she
not
said
maggie
breathing
very
quickly
i
love
her
very
much
i
been
thinking
paul
i
not
been
good
about
my
relations
all
this
time
i
ought
to
have
seen
them
more
i
must
go
up
to
london
at
once
if
your
aunt
bad
and
wants
you
i
suppose
you
must
he
answered
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
her
he
kissed
her
suddenly
you
be
wanting
some
money
he
said
do
be
long
away
i
miss
you
she
caught
the
train
it
seemed
very
strange
to
her
to
be
sitting
in
it
alone
after
the
many
months
when
she
had
been
always
either
with
grace
or
paul
an
odd
sense
of
adventure
surrounded
her
and
she
felt
as
though
she
were
now
at
last
approaching
the
climax
to
which
the
slow
events
of
the
last
two
years
had
been
leading
when
she
had
been
a
little
girl
one
of
the
few
interesting
books
in
the
house
had
been
the
mysteries
of
udulpho
she
could
see
the
romance
now
with
its
four
dumpy
volumes
the
f
so
confusingly
like
s
the
faded
print
and
the
yellowing
page
she
could
remember
little
enough
of
it
but
there
had
been
one
scene
near
the
beginning
of
the
story
when
the
heroine
emily
looking
for
something
in
the
dusk
had
noticed
some
lines
pencilled
on
the
wainscot
these
mysterious
pencilled
lines
had
been
the
beginning
of
all
her
troubles
and
maggie
as
a
small
girl
had
approached
sometimes
in
the
evening
dusk
the
walls
of
her
attic
to
see
whether
there
too
verses
had
been
scribbled
now
obscure
in
the
corner
of
her
carriage
she
felt
as
though
the
telegram
had
been
a
pencilled
message
presaging
some
great
event
that
would
shortly
change
her
life
it
was
a
dark
and
gloomy
day
misty
with
a
gale
of
wind
that
blew
the
smoke
into
curls
and
eddies
against
the
sky
there
seemed
to
be
a
roar
about
the
vast
london
station
that
threatened
her
personally
but
she
beat
down
her
fears
found
a
taxi
and
gave
the
driver
the
address
as
they
drove
along
she
felt
how
much
older
how
much
older
she
was
then
than
when
she
was
last
in
london
then
she
had
been
ignorant
of
all
life
and
the
world
now
she
felt
that
she
was
an
old
old
woman
with
an
infinite
knowledge
of
marriage
and
men
and
women
and
the
way
they
lived
she
looked
upon
her
aunts
and
indeed
all
that
world
that
had
surrounded
the
chapel
as
something
infinitely
childish
and
for
that
reason
rather
sweet
and
touching
she
could
be
kind
and
friendly
even
to
amy
warlock
she
thought
she
wished
that
she
had
some
excuse
so
that
she
might
stay
in
london
a
week
or
two
she
felt
that
she
could
stretch
her
limbs
and
breathe
again
now
that
she
was
out
of
sight
and
she
would
find
out
uncle
mathew
address
and
pay
him
a
surprise
visit
she
laughed
in
the
cab
and
felt
gay
and
until
she
remembered
the
cause
of
her
visit
poor
poor
aunt
anne
oh
she
did
hope
that
she
would
be
well
enough
to
recognise
her
and
to
show
pleasure
at
seeing
her
the
cab
had
stopped
in
the
street
before
the
same
old
house
nothing
seemed
to
have
changed
and
the
sight
of
it
all
brought
martin
back
to
her
with
so
fierce
a
pang
that
for
a
moment
breath
seemed
to
leave
her
body
it
was
just
near
here
only
a
few
steps
away
that
he
had
suddenly
appeared
as
though
from
the
very
when
she
had
been
with
uncle
mathew
and
then
had
gone
to
supper
with
him
it
was
from
this
door
that
he
had
run
on
that
last
desperate
day
she
looked
up
at
the
windows
the
blinds
were
not
down
her
aunt
was
yet
alive
she
paid
the
taxi
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
martha
who
seemed
infinitely
older
and
more
wrinkled
than
on
the
last
occasion
her
old
face
was
yellow
like
drawn
parchment
and
her
thin
grey
hairs
were
pasted
back
over
her
old
skull
she
was
wearing
black
mittens
miss
maggie
and
there
was
a
real
welcome
in
her
voice
maggie
was
drawn
into
the
dark
little
hall
that
smelt
of
cracknel
biscuits
and
lamp
oil
there
was
the
green
baize
door
and
then
suddenly
the
shrill
cry
of
the
parrot
and
then
out
of
the
dark
the
fiery
eyes
of
thomas
the
cat
oh
miss
maggie
said
martha
or
i
suppose
i
should
say
now
it
a
long
long
time
yes
it
is
said
maggie
how
is
my
aunt
if
she
lives
through
the
night
they
be
surprised
martha
answered
wheezing
and
sighing
yes
the
doctor
says
if
miss
cardinal
sees
morning
he
says
then
as
maggie
hesitated
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
if
you
go
straight
to
the
miss
mum
magnus
is
waiting
tea
for
you
there
maggie
went
up
past
the
armed
men
into
the
old
room
she
could
have
kissed
all
the
things
for
their
old
remembered
intimacy
and
friendliness
the
pictures
the
books
the
old
faded
carpet
the
the
chairs
and
there
too
was
magnus
looking
just
as
he
used
to
look
with
his
spectacles
and
his
projecting
ears
his
timid
smile
and
apologetic
voice
he
did
seem
for
a
moment
afraid
of
her
then
her
boyish
air
her
unfeigned
pleasure
and
happiness
at
being
back
there
again
and
a
certain
childish
awkwardness
with
which
she
shook
hands
and
sat
herself
behind
the
little
reassured
him
you
not
changed
at
all
he
told
her
is
that
dreadful
she
said
when
all
the
way
in
the
cab
i
been
telling
myself
how
utterly
different
i
am
i
suppose
you
feel
older
he
asked
her
older
why
centuries
you
do
look
a
day
he
said
smiling
at
her
that
my
short
hair
she
answered
smiling
back
at
him
and
not
being
able
to
wear
my
clothes
like
a
grown
woman
it
a
fact
that
i
ca
get
used
to
long
skirts
and
in
skeaton
it
bad
form
to
cross
your
knees
i
try
and
remember
she
sighed
the
truth
is
i
forget
everything
just
as
i
used
to
how
is
aunt
she
asked
him
he
looked
very
grave
and
behind
his
smiles
and
welcome
to
her
she
saw
that
he
was
a
tired
and
even
exhausted
man
they
do
think
she
can
live
through
the
night
he
answered
her
but
thank
god
she
out
of
all
pain
and
will
never
suffer
any
more
she
tranquil
in
her
mind
too
and
the
one
thing
she
wanted
to
put
her
quiet
was
to
see
you
she
been
worrying
about
you
for
months
why
did
you
come
up
to
see
us
all
this
time
maggie
that
was
kind
of
you
no
it
was
said
maggie
but
i
did
dare
did
dare
he
asked
astonished
no
there
were
things
all
this
would
have
reminded
me
of
too
badly
it
was
safe
to
be
reminded
of
them
have
you
been
happy
then
there
he
asked
her
almost
in
a
whisper
oh
i
do
know
she
did
look
up
at
him
i
made
a
mistake
in
doing
it
it
was
my
fault
not
theirs
no
i
have
been
happy
if
you
want
to
know
and
i
sha
be
there
no
chance
it
all
wrong
they
all
hate
me
i
seem
to
them
odd
mad
like
a
witch
they
used
to
burn
in
the
old
days
and
i
ca
alter
myself
and
i
do
want
to
it
was
amazing
what
good
it
did
her
to
bring
all
this
out
she
had
said
none
of
it
to
any
one
before
oh
dear
oh
dear
sighed
magnus
i
had
known
i
thought
it
was
all
going
so
well
but
do
tell
your
aunt
this
when
she
asks
you
say
you
very
very
happy
and
it
all
going
perfectly
she
must
die
at
peace
will
you
my
dear
will
you
his
almost
trembling
anxiety
touched
her
why
dear
magnus
of
course
i
will
and
i
am
happy
now
that
back
with
all
of
you
all
i
want
is
for
people
to
be
fond
of
me
you
know
but
there
something
in
me
she
jumped
up
and
stood
in
front
of
him
magnus
you
wise
you
write
books
you
know
all
about
things
tell
me
tell
me
the
absolute
truth
am
i
odd
am
i
queer
am
i
like
a
witch
that
ought
to
be
burnt
at
the
stake
he
was
deeply
touched
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
then
suddenly
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
i
do
find
you
odd
my
dear
but
then
god
forgive
me
i
odd
myself
we
all
rather
odd
in
this
house
i
afraid
but
do
you
worry
maggie
you
worth
a
of
ordinary
people
she
drew
slowly
away
she
sighed
i
wish
paul
and
grace
only
thought
so
she
said
they
had
a
quiet
little
tea
together
maggie
was
longing
to
ask
magnus
questions
about
himself
but
she
did
dare
to
do
so
he
wrapped
himself
in
a
reserved
friendly
melancholy
which
she
could
not
penetrate
he
looked
so
much
older
so
much
more
faded
as
though
the
heat
and
fire
had
gradually
stolen
away
from
him
and
left
him
only
the
grey
ghost
of
what
he
had
been
are
you
writing
any
books
mr
magnus
she
asked
him
any
books
he
answered
smiling
surely
one
would
be
enough
my
dear
i
have
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
it
not
satisfactory
if
it
were
for
the
bread
and
butter
i
do
think
ever
tackle
it
again
or
rather
the
bread
i
should
say
it
precious
little
butter
it
brings
in
what
it
called
she
asked
toad
in
the
hole
he
said
what
a
funny
name
what
does
it
mean
i
do
know
he
shook
his
head
it
meant
something
when
i
began
it
but
the
meaning
does
seem
important
now
in
a
little
while
he
left
her
saying
now
if
i
were
you
i
take
a
little
nap
and
later
on
i
wake
you
and
we
go
and
see
your
aunt
she
slept
lying
back
in
the
blue
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
with
only
the
leaping
flames
as
light
to
the
room
strange
and
dim
but
unspeakably
sweet
were
her
dreams
it
seemed
that
she
had
escaped
for
ever
from
paul
and
grace
and
skeaton
and
that
in
some
strange
way
martin
was
back
with
her
again
the
same
old
martin
with
his
laugh
and
the
light
in
his
eyes
and
his
rough
red
face
he
had
come
into
the
room
he
was
standing
by
the
door
looking
at
her
she
ran
to
him
her
hands
stretched
out
cries
of
joy
on
her
lips
but
oven
as
she
reached
him
there
was
a
cry
through
the
house
your
aunt
anne
is
dead
your
aunt
anne
is
dead
and
all
the
bells
began
to
toll
and
she
was
in
the
chapel
again
and
great
crowds
surged
past
her
aunt
anne
bier
borne
on
high
above
them
all
she
cried
aloud
and
woke
to
find
magnus
standing
at
her
side
one
glance
at
him
told
her
that
he
was
in
terrible
distress
you
must
come
at
once
he
said
your
aunt
may
have
only
a
few
minutes
to
live
she
followed
him
still
only
rubbing
her
eyes
with
her
knuckles
and
feeling
as
though
she
were
continuing
that
episode
when
martha
had
led
her
at
the
dead
of
night
into
her
aunt
bedroom
the
chill
of
the
passages
however
woke
her
fully
and
then
her
one
longing
and
desire
was
that
aunt
anne
should
be
conscious
enough
to
recognise
her
and
be
aware
of
her
love
for
her
the
close
room
with
its
smell
of
medicines
and
and
its
strange
breathless
hush
frightened
her
just
as
it
had
done
once
before
she
saw
again
the
religious
picture
the
bleeding
christ
and
the
crucifix
the
high
white
bed
the
dim
windows
and
the
little
table
with
the
bottles
and
the
glasses
it
was
all
as
it
had
been
before
her
terror
grew
she
felt
as
though
no
power
could
drag
her
to
that
bed
something
lurked
there
something
horrible
and
unclean
that
would
spring
upon
her
and
hold
her
down
with
its
claws
maggie
said
the
clear
faint
voice
that
she
knew
so
well
her
terror
left
her
she
did
not
notice
aunt
elizabeth
who
was
seated
close
to
the
bed
nor
magnus
nor
the
nurse
nor
the
doctor
she
went
forward
unafraid
doctor
would
you
mind
the
voice
went
on
three
minutes
alone
with
my
niece
the
doctor
a
stout
man
said
something
the
figures
all
shadowy
in
the
dim
light
withdrew
maggie
was
aware
of
nothing
except
that
there
was
something
of
the
utmost
urgency
that
she
must
say
she
came
close
to
the
bed
found
a
chair
there
sat
down
and
bent
forward
there
her
aunt
was
lying
the
black
hair
in
a
dark
shadow
across
the
pillow
the
face
white
and
sharp
and
the
eyes
burning
with
a
fierce
light
they
had
the
intense
gaze
of
a
blind
man
to
whom
sight
has
suddenly
been
given
he
cries
i
see
i
see
stretching
out
his
arms
towards
the
sun
the
trees
the
rich
green
fields
she
turned
her
head
and
put
both
her
hands
about
maggie
she
smiled
maggie
said
oh
aunt
anne
do
you
feel
bad
no
dear
i
in
no
pain
at
all
now
that
you
come
i
quite
happy
it
was
my
one
anxiety
her
voice
was
very
faint
so
that
maggie
had
to
lean
forward
to
catch
the
words
you
have
thought
me
unkind
all
this
time
said
maggie
not
to
have
come
but
it
has
been
unkindness
many
times
i
wanted
but
there
seemed
to
be
so
much
to
do
that
it
was
right
to
come
away
are
you
happy
dear
aunt
anne
said
in
her
ghostly
whisper
very
very
happy
said
maggie
remembering
what
magnus
had
said
to
her
aunt
anne
sighed
ah
that
good
it
was
my
one
worry
that
you
might
be
happy
i
was
all
wrong
about
you
maggie
trying
to
push
you
my
way
instead
of
letting
you
go
your
own
i
should
have
waited
for
god
to
show
his
direction
but
i
was
impatient
and
if
you
were
unhappy
she
broke
off
and
for
a
moment
maggie
thought
that
she
would
speak
no
more
she
lay
there
with
her
eyes
closed
like
a
waxen
image
she
went
on
again
i
always
loved
you
maggie
from
the
very
first
but
i
was
so
impatient
for
you
to
come
to
god
i
thought
he
would
reveal
himself
and
you
not
be
ready
he
did
reveal
himself
but
not
as
i
had
thought
he
came
that
night
and
took
warlock
with
him
that
was
true
maggie
that
night
all
true
all
true
god
will
show
you
his
way
it
will
be
revealed
to
you
heaven
and
its
glories
god
and
his
dear
son
she
stopped
again
and
lay
with
her
eyes
closed
maggie
timidly
at
last
said
aunt
anne
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
for
all
my
wickedness
i
mean
to
be
wicked
but
i
just
could
say
my
feelings
out
loud
i
was
shy
of
them
somehow
i
still
am
perhaps
maybe
i
always
will
be
but
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
know
now
how
good
you
were
to
me
all
that
time
and
i
grateful
from
my
heart
you
get
better
wo
you
aunt
anne
and
then
i
come
often
shy
to
say
my
feelings
but
i
love
you
aunt
anne
for
what
you
been
to
me
she
stopped
there
was
a
deathly
stillness
in
the
chamber
the
lamp
had
sunk
low
and
the
fire
was
a
gold
cavern
dusk
stole
on
stealthy
feet
from
wall
to
wall
aunt
anne
did
not
it
seemed
breathe
her
hands
had
dropped
from
maggie
and
her
arms
lay
straight
upon
the
sheet
her
eyes
were
closed
suddenly
she
whispered
dear
maggie
maggie
my
lord
and
my
god
my
master
then
very
faintly
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
my
shepherd
he
shall
lead
me
forth
beside
the
pastures
my
rod
and
my
staff
the
lord
she
gave
a
little
sigh
and
her
head
rolled
to
one
side
maggie
with
a
startled
fear
was
suddenly
conscious
that
she
was
alone
in
the
room
she
went
to
the
door
and
called
for
the
doctor
as
they
gathered
about
the
bed
the
caverns
of
the
fire
fell
with
the
sharp
sound
of
a
closing
door
next
morning
maggie
wrote
to
paul
telling
him
that
her
aunt
was
dead
that
the
funeral
would
be
in
two
days
time
and
that
she
would
stay
in
london
until
that
was
over
she
had
not
very
much
time
just
then
to
think
of
the
house
and
the
dead
woman
in
it
because
on
the
there
was
this
letter
for
her
cromwell
kensington
march
dear
trenchard
i
hear
that
you
have
come
to
london
to
visit
your
aunt
i
have
been
hoping
for
some
time
past
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
i
am
sure
that
you
will
have
no
wish
at
all
to
see
me
at
the
same
time
i
do
beg
you
to
give
me
half
an
hour
at
the
above
address
five
would
be
a
good
time
please
ask
for
miss
warlock
believe
me
yours
faithfully
amy
warlock
maggie
stared
at
the
signature
then
with
a
thickly
beating
heart
decided
that
of
course
she
would
go
she
was
not
afraid
but
sister
what
would
come
of
it
the
house
was
strangely
silent
aunt
elizabeth
sniffed
into
her
handkerchief
a
good
deal
magnus
his
face
strained
with
a
look
of
intense
fatigue
went
out
about
some
business
the
blinds
of
the
house
wore
down
and
all
the
rooms
were
bathed
in
a
green
twilight
about
quarter
past
four
maggie
went
down
into
the
strand
and
found
a
cab
she
gave
the
address
and
off
they
went
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
cab
she
seemed
to
be
an
entirely
passive
spectator
of
events
that
were
being
played
before
her
she
knew
remotely
that
aunt
death
had
deeply
affected
her
that
coming
back
to
the
old
house
had
deeply
affected
her
and
that
this
interview
with
amy
warlock
might
simply
fasten
on
her
the
fate
that
she
had
for
many
months
now
seen
in
front
of
her
she
could
not
escape
and
she
did
not
want
to
escape
they
found
the
house
a
very
grimy
looking
one
in
the
interminable
cromwell
road
maggie
rang
a
jangling
bell
and
the
door
was
ultimately
opened
by
a
woman
with
sleeves
turned
up
at
the
elbows
and
a
dirty
apron
is
miss
warlock
at
home
the
woman
sniffed
i
expect
so
she
said
most
times
she
is
what
name
trenchard
maggie
said
she
was
admitted
into
a
hall
that
smelt
of
food
and
seemed
in
the
to
be
full
of
umbrellas
the
woman
went
upstairs
but
soon
returned
to
say
that
miss
warlock
would
see
the
lady
maggie
found
that
in
the
the
gas
was
dimly
burning
there
was
the
usual
furniture
and
on
a
faded
red
sofa
near
the
fire
old
warlock
was
lying
maggie
could
not
see
her
very
clearly
in
the
but
there
was
something
about
her
immobility
and
the
stiffness
of
her
head
decorated
as
of
old
with
its
frilly
white
cap
that
reminded
one
of
a
figure
made
out
of
wax
maggie
turned
to
find
amy
warlock
standing
close
to
her
thurston
maggie
began
hesitating
you
may
not
know
said
amy
warlock
that
i
have
retained
my
maiden
name
sit
down
wo
you
it
is
good
of
you
to
have
come
the
voice
was
a
little
more
genial
than
it
had
been
in
the
old
days
nevertheless
this
was
still
the
old
amy
warlock
stiff
masculine
impenetrable
i
hope
your
aunt
is
better
she
said
my
aunt
is
dead
answered
maggie
dear
me
i
sorry
to
hear
that
she
was
a
good
woman
and
did
many
kind
actions
in
her
time
there
was
something
very
unpleasant
about
that
room
with
the
yellow
light
the
hissing
gas
and
the
immobile
figure
on
the
sofa
maggie
looked
in
the
direction
of
old
warlock
you
need
mind
mother
said
amy
warlock
for
some
time
now
been
completely
paralysed
she
ca
speak
or
move
but
she
likes
to
be
downstairs
to
see
the
world
a
bit
it
sad
after
the
way
that
she
used
to
enjoy
life
father
death
was
a
great
shock
to
her
it
was
sad
maggie
remembered
how
fond
she
had
been
of
her
food
like
a
waxen
image
like
a
waxen
image
the
whole
room
was
ghoulish
and
unnatural
i
asked
you
to
come
and
see
me
trenchard
continued
miss
warlock
not
because
we
can
have
any
wish
to
meet
i
am
sure
we
have
never
liked
one
another
but
i
have
something
on
my
conscience
and
i
may
not
have
another
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
i
do
suppose
you
have
heard
that
very
shortly
i
intend
to
enter
a
nunnery
at
roehampton
and
your
mother
asked
maggie
mother
will
go
into
a
home
answered
miss
warlock
there
was
a
strange
little
sound
from
the
sofa
like
a
rat
nibbling
behind
the
wainscot
i
must
tell
you
said
miss
warlock
speaking
apparently
with
some
difficulty
that
i
have
done
you
a
wrong
shortly
after
my
death
my
brother
wrote
to
you
from
paris
wrote
to
me
repeated
maggie
yes
wrote
to
you
through
me
i
destroyed
the
letters
he
wrote
then
five
times
in
rather
swift
succession
i
destroyed
all
the
letters
maggie
said
nothing
i
destroyed
the
letters
continued
amy
warlock
because
i
did
not
wish
you
and
my
brother
to
come
together
i
did
not
wish
you
to
simply
out
of
hatred
for
you
both
i
thought
that
my
brother
killed
my
father
whom
whom
i
loved
i
knew
that
the
one
human
being
whom
martin
had
ever
loved
beside
his
father
was
yourself
he
did
love
you
trenchard
more
truly
than
i
had
believed
it
in
his
power
to
love
any
one
i
think
you
could
have
made
him
happy
therefore
i
did
not
wish
you
to
meet
again
there
was
a
pause
maggie
said
at
last
were
there
no
other
letters
yes
said
miss
warlock
one
this
summer
for
more
than
a
year
there
was
nothing
then
this
summer
a
little
one
i
destroyed
that
too
what
did
it
say
asked
maggie
it
said
that
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
been
married
was
dead
he
said
that
if
you
did
answer
this
letter
he
would
understand
that
you
would
not
want
to
hear
from
him
any
more
he
had
been
very
where
did
he
write
that
in
paris
and
where
is
he
now
i
do
know
i
have
heard
from
him
no
more
maggie
got
up
and
stood
her
head
raised
as
though
listening
for
something
you
been
very
cruel
miss
warlock
she
said
perhaps
i
have
said
miss
warlock
but
you
can
not
judge
until
you
know
with
what
reason
i
hated
my
brother
it
is
a
very
old
story
however
now
i
hate
no
one
i
will
not
apologise
for
what
i
have
done
i
do
not
want
your
forgiveness
i
had
to
absolve
my
conscience
and
you
have
no
idea
where
he
is
now
i
have
no
idea
he
may
be
dead
for
all
i
know
maggie
shivered
if
you
have
any
more
information
you
will
give
it
me
i
will
give
it
you
this
is
my
address
maggie
gave
her
a
card
they
said
looking
for
one
moment
face
to
face
eye
to
eye
then
maggie
turned
and
went
her
eyes
were
dim
so
that
she
stumbled
on
the
stairs
in
the
street
she
walked
caring
nothing
of
her
direction
seeing
only
martin
chapter
viii
death
of
uncle
mathew
grace
during
the
days
that
maggie
was
in
london
regained
something
of
her
old
tranquillity
it
was
wonderful
to
her
to
be
able
to
potter
about
the
house
once
more
mistress
of
all
that
she
surveyed
and
protected
from
every
watching
eye
she
had
had
from
her
very
earliest
years
a
horror
of
being
what
she
called
overlooked
she
had
a
habit
of
stopping
when
she
had
climbed
halfway
upstairs
of
suddenly
jerking
her
head
round
to
see
whether
any
one
were
looking
at
her
you
would
have
sworn
had
you
seen
her
that
she
was
deeply
engaged
upon
some
nefarious
and
underhand
plot
yet
it
was
not
was
simply
going
to
dust
some
of
her
hideous
china
treasures
in
her
bedroom
always
after
breakfast
there
was
this
pleasant
ritual
she
would
plod
all
round
the
house
duster
in
hand
picking
things
up
giving
them
a
little
flick
and
putting
them
back
again
patting
treasures
that
she
especially
loved
sighing
heavily
with
satisfaction
at
the
pleasant
sight
of
all
her
possessions
tranquilly
in
their
right
places
as
she
looked
around
the
ugly
and
saw
the
red
glazed
pots
with
the
ferns
the
faded
the
worsted
mats
and
the
china
shepherdesses
a
rich
warm
feeling
rose
in
her
heart
and
filled
her
whole
body
it
was
like
a
fine
meal
to
a
hungry
man
every
morning
at
nine
she
was
hungry
in
this
fashion
and
every
morning
by
eleven
she
was
satisfied
her
thick
body
thus
promenaded
the
house
she
was
like
a
stolid
policeman
in
female
attire
going
his
rounds
to
see
that
all
was
well
from
room
to
room
she
went
pausing
to
pant
for
breath
on
the
stairs
stumbling
always
because
of
her
short
sight
at
the
three
dark
little
steps
just
outside
paul
bedroom
always
sitting
down
on
her
bed
to
take
a
breath
and
to
get
a
full
gaze
at
the
crucifix
of
bright
yellow
wood
that
hung
just
under
her
mother
picture
tramp
tramp
tramp
round
the
house
she
went
it
was
incredible
how
deeply
maggie
had
interfered
with
this
ritual
she
had
certainly
not
intended
to
do
so
after
that
first
effort
to
change
certain
things
in
the
house
she
had
retired
from
the
battle
had
completely
capitulated
nevertheless
she
had
interfered
with
all
grace
movements
and
as
the
terror
of
her
grew
it
seemed
to
pervade
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
house
so
that
grace
felt
that
she
could
go
nowhere
without
that
invasion
oh
how
she
resented
it
and
how
afraid
she
was
after
paul
and
maggie
returned
from
that
summer
holiday
she
saw
that
paul
too
felt
maggie
strangeness
to
grace
from
the
beginning
of
that
autumn
every
movement
and
gesture
of
maggie
was
strange
the
oddity
of
her
appearance
her
ignorance
of
everything
that
seemed
to
grace
to
be
life
her
strange
attitude
to
the
church
and
its
affairs
like
a
heathen
in
central
africa
her
dislike
of
the
maxses
and
the
pynsents
and
her
liking
for
the
toms
and
caroline
purdie
her
odd
silences
and
still
odder
speeches
all
these
things
increased
the
atmosphere
that
separated
her
from
the
rest
of
the
world
then
came
the
day
when
grace
dusting
in
maggie
bedroom
discovered
the
bundle
of
letters
she
read
them
read
them
with
shame
at
her
own
dishonesty
and
anger
at
maggie
for
making
her
dishonest
to
her
virgin
ignorance
the
passion
in
them
spoke
of
illicit
love
and
the
grossest
immorality
her
heart
burnt
with
a
strange
mingling
of
envy
jealousy
loneliness
shame
and
eagerness
to
know
more
then
came
uncle
mathew
visit
then
caroline
purdie
disgrace
the
count
was
fully
charged
maggie
that
strange
girl
found
in
the
heart
of
london
darkness
alone
without
friends
or
parents
was
a
witch
a
devilish
witch
who
might
at
any
time
fly
through
the
on
a
as
surely
as
any
mediaeval
old
hag
these
visions
might
be
exaggerated
for
many
human
beings
not
so
for
grace
having
no
imagination
she
was
soaked
in
superstition
she
clung
to
a
few
simple
pictures
and
was
exposed
to
every
terror
that
those
pictures
could
supply
maggie
now
haunted
her
day
and
night
everywhere
she
could
feel
maggie
eyes
piercing
her
a
thousand
times
an
hour
she
looked
up
to
see
whether
maggie
were
not
there
in
the
room
watching
her
she
hated
her
now
with
terror
that
was
partly
fear
for
her
own
safety
partly
love
and
jealousy
for
paul
partly
outraged
modesty
and
tradition
partly
sheer
panic
she
had
as
yet
said
very
little
to
paul
she
waited
the
right
moment
maggie
absence
showed
her
how
deep
and
devastating
this
fear
had
been
she
saw
that
it
embraced
the
whole
life
of
paul
and
herself
in
skeaton
she
had
grown
fond
of
skeaton
she
was
a
woman
who
would
inevitably
care
for
anything
when
she
had
become
thoroughly
accustomed
to
its
ways
and
was
assured
that
it
would
do
her
no
harm
she
liked
the
shops
and
the
woods
the
sand
and
the
sea
above
all
she
adored
the
church
during
a
large
part
of
every
day
she
was
there
pottering
about
talking
to
the
caretaker
poking
her
nose
into
the
to
see
whether
the
had
drawn
pictures
in
them
rubbing
the
brasses
making
tidy
the
vestry
the
house
too
she
loved
and
the
garden
and
the
bottles
on
the
wall
she
might
have
known
that
she
was
not
popular
in
the
place
she
can
not
have
failed
to
realise
that
she
had
no
woman
friend
and
that
she
was
seldom
invited
to
dinner
this
did
not
matter
to
her
her
affections
and
they
were
very
real
and
genuine
were
all
for
her
brother
had
she
paul
she
wanted
no
one
else
that
was
enough
and
now
it
might
be
that
they
would
have
to
leave
the
place
already
the
talk
about
maggie
was
intolerable
grace
heard
it
on
every
side
after
mathew
cardinal
visit
the
talk
rose
to
a
shriek
grace
knew
that
those
sudden
silences
on
her
entrance
into
the
room
meant
lively
and
excited
discussion
how
terrible
for
the
poor
rector
such
an
odd
girl
taken
out
of
the
slums
yes
quite
drunk
he
knocked
maxse
down
oh
i
assure
you
that
she
went
to
see
caroline
purdie
the
very
day
after
she
did
indeed
yes
grace
knew
all
about
it
unless
things
changed
paul
would
have
to
go
his
life
was
ruined
by
this
girl
nevertheless
for
a
whole
happy
week
the
world
seemed
to
sink
back
into
its
old
accustomed
apathy
the
very
house
seemed
to
take
on
its
old
atmosphere
paul
came
out
of
his
study
and
went
about
paying
calls
that
hour
from
six
to
seven
when
he
was
at
home
to
his
parishioners
seemed
once
again
to
be
crowded
with
anxious
old
women
and
men
out
of
work
and
girls
in
trouble
he
took
grace
with
him
on
his
rounds
every
one
was
very
friendly
grace
was
able
to
reassume
some
of
her
old
importance
her
old
flow
of
conversation
checked
recently
by
the
sense
of
strangeness
returned
to
her
in
the
morning
she
would
stand
by
her
brother
duster
in
hand
and
pour
out
her
heart
you
know
paul
it
all
very
well
you
may
say
what
you
like
but
if
maxse
thinks
she
going
to
have
the
whole
of
that
second
pew
she
mistaken
it
only
for
a
week
or
two
that
she
got
the
broadbents
staying
with
her
and
i
know
what
she
after
just
fancy
what
she
wants
is
to
put
the
broadbents
in
that
second
seat
the
two
sundays
they
here
and
then
stick
to
it
after
they
gone
just
fancy
what
miss
beats
and
miss
hopwood
will
feel
about
it
what
i
mean
is
that
they
had
that
seat
for
nearly
eight
years
and
now
to
be
turned
out
but
i
assure
you
paul
from
what
linda
maxse
said
to
me
yesterday
i
believe
she
intends
that
i
do
indeed
she
thinks
miss
beats
and
miss
hopwood
will
get
used
to
sitting
somewhere
else
after
two
sundays
sure
they
wo
mind
poor
old
things
she
said
only
yesterday
old
things
just
fancy
why
mary
beats
is
very
little
older
than
i
you
have
to
put
your
foot
down
about
it
you
will
indeed
paul
yes
you
will
give
linda
maxse
an
inch
and
she
takes
a
mile
i
always
said
and
this
is
just
the
kind
of
thing
so
happily
grace
ran
on
and
paul
looked
up
from
his
desk
at
her
digging
his
fingers
into
his
white
hair
smiling
at
her
in
just
the
old
confidential
way
that
he
used
to
have
before
maggie
came
she
revived
too
her
old
habit
of
talking
to
herself
this
had
always
been
an
immense
relief
to
her
it
had
helped
her
to
feel
reassurance
lately
she
had
felt
that
maggie
was
overhearing
her
and
was
laughing
at
her
this
had
checked
her
and
made
her
suspicious
now
as
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
she
would
murmur
to
herself
it
might
be
better
to
tell
jenny
to
go
to
bartletts
after
all
it
quicker
that
way
and
she
be
able
to
tell
the
boy
to
bring
the
things
back
she
wait
all
the
same
she
stupid
she
make
a
muddle
of
it
as
likely
as
not
and
womball
boy
is
livelier
than
bartletts
that
something
after
all
but
if
she
goes
out
at
she
never
be
back
by
four
unless
she
went
by
smith
lane
of
course
she
might
do
that
oh
dear
these
stairs
are
a
trial
yes
she
might
do
that
and
then
she
only
be
an
hour
altogether
i
suggest
that
her
murmur
was
a
cheerful
monotonous
sound
accompanying
her
as
she
went
she
would
stop
and
rub
the
side
of
her
nose
with
her
thumb
considering
in
the
house
when
there
was
no
fear
of
callers
she
wore
large
loose
slippers
that
as
she
went
in
the
evenings
she
sat
in
paul
study
all
amongst
the
cornhills
the
temple
bars
and
the
bible
concordances
they
were
very
cosy
and
happy
and
she
talked
incessantly
for
some
reason
she
did
not
dare
to
ask
him
whether
he
were
not
happier
now
that
maggie
was
away
she
did
not
dare
there
was
not
the
complete
confidence
that
there
had
been
paul
was
strange
a
little
bewitched
by
maggie
strangeness
there
was
something
there
that
grace
did
not
understand
so
she
said
nothing
but
she
tried
to
convey
to
him
in
the
peculiar
warmth
of
her
kiss
what
she
felt
then
maggie
returned
she
came
back
in
her
black
clothes
and
with
her
pale
face
her
aunt
had
died
she
was
more
alone
even
than
before
she
was
very
quiet
and
agreed
to
everything
that
grace
said
nevertheless
although
she
agreed
she
was
more
antagonistic
than
she
had
been
she
had
now
something
that
intensely
preoccupied
her
grace
could
see
that
she
was
always
thinking
about
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
skeaton
or
paul
or
the
house
she
was
more
than
ever
forgot
everything
liked
best
to
sit
in
her
bedroom
all
alone
oh
she
mad
said
grace
she
really
mad
just
fancy
if
she
should
go
right
off
her
head
grace
was
now
so
desperately
frightened
that
she
lay
awake
at
night
sweating
listening
to
every
sound
if
she
should
come
and
murder
me
one
night
she
thought
another
thought
she
had
was
it
just
as
though
she
sees
some
one
all
the
time
who
is
there
then
came
march
that
dreadful
day
that
would
be
never
forgotten
by
grace
so
long
as
she
lived
during
the
whole
of
the
past
week
skeaton
had
been
delivered
up
to
a
tempest
of
wind
and
rain
the
high
street
emptied
of
human
beings
had
glittered
and
swayed
under
the
sweeping
storm
the
skeaton
sea
possessing
suddenly
a
life
of
its
own
had
stormed
upon
the
skeaton
promenade
and
worried
and
lashed
and
soaked
that
hideous
structure
to
within
an
inch
of
its
unnatural
life
behind
the
town
the
woods
had
swayed
and
creaked
funeral
black
against
the
grey
thick
sky
across
the
folds
the
rain
fell
in
slanting
sheets
with
the
sibilant
hiss
of
relentless
power
and
resolve
after
luncheon
on
this
day
the
maggie
disappeared
into
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
grace
settled
down
on
the
sofa
to
a
nice
little
nap
she
fell
asleep
to
the
comforting
patter
of
rain
upon
the
windows
and
the
howling
of
the
storm
down
the
chimney
she
dreamt
as
she
often
did
about
food
she
was
awakened
with
a
sudden
start
by
a
sense
of
apprehension
this
happened
to
her
now
so
often
that
there
was
nothing
strange
in
it
but
she
jumped
up
with
beating
heart
from
the
sofa
crying
out
happened
what
the
matter
she
realised
that
the
room
had
grown
darker
since
she
fell
asleep
and
although
it
was
early
still
there
was
a
sort
of
grey
twilight
that
stood
out
against
a
deeper
dusk
in
the
garden
beyond
what
is
it
she
said
again
and
then
saw
that
jenny
the
maid
was
standing
in
the
doorway
well
jenny
she
asked
trying
to
recover
some
of
her
dignity
it
a
man
mum
said
the
little
girl
grace
had
got
her
cheap
from
an
orphanage
a
gentleman
mum
he
asking
for
trenchard
give
me
card
oh
mum
is
wet
too
she
had
scarcely
finished
and
grace
had
only
taken
the
card
when
mathew
cardinal
came
forward
out
of
the
hall
he
was
a
dim
and
mysterious
figure
in
that
but
grace
could
see
that
he
was
more
battered
and
shabby
than
on
his
last
visit
his
coat
collar
was
turned
up
she
could
only
very
vaguely
see
his
face
but
it
seemed
to
her
strangely
white
when
before
it
had
been
so
grossly
red
she
was
struck
by
his
immobility
partly
perhaps
because
she
had
been
roused
from
sleep
and
was
yet
neither
clear
nor
resolved
he
seemed
to
her
some
nightmare
figure
this
was
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
all
the
trouble
and
scandal
this
was
the
man
who
threatened
to
drive
paul
and
herself
from
her
home
this
was
the
blackguard
who
had
not
known
how
to
behave
in
decent
society
but
behind
that
was
the
terror
of
the
mystery
that
enveloped
maggie
the
girl
uncle
the
man
who
had
shared
in
her
strange
earlier
life
and
made
her
what
she
now
was
as
he
stood
there
motionless
silent
the
water
dripping
from
his
clothes
grace
was
as
frightened
as
though
he
had
already
offered
her
personal
violence
or
held
a
pistol
to
her
head
what
do
you
want
she
asked
hoarsely
stepping
back
to
the
sofa
jenny
had
left
the
room
i
want
to
see
my
niece
he
answered
still
without
moving
she
recognised
then
strangely
in
his
voice
a
terror
akin
to
her
own
he
also
was
afraid
of
something
of
what
it
was
not
that
his
voice
shook
or
that
his
tongue
faltered
but
he
was
terrified
she
could
feel
his
heart
thumping
behind
the
words
i
sorry
she
said
you
ca
see
her
she
upstairs
resting
she
did
not
know
whence
the
resolution
had
come
that
he
was
not
in
any
case
to
see
maggie
she
did
not
know
what
catastrophe
she
anticipated
from
their
meeting
she
was
simply
resolved
as
though
acting
under
the
blind
orders
of
some
other
power
that
maggie
should
not
see
him
and
that
he
should
leave
the
house
at
once
i
must
see
her
he
said
and
the
desperate
urgency
in
his
voice
would
have
touched
any
one
less
terrified
than
grace
i
must
i
sorry
she
answered
the
fear
in
his
voice
seemed
now
to
give
her
superiority
over
him
it
impossible
oh
no
he
said
if
she
here
it
ca
be
impossible
she
want
to
see
me
we
have
things
i
must
you
do
understand
miss
trenchard
i
only
know
said
grace
that
after
what
occurred
on
your
last
visit
here
cardinal
maggie
said
that
she
would
never
see
you
again
that
a
lie
he
said
she
made
no
answer
then
at
last
he
said
pitifully
she
did
really
say
that
did
she
yes
i
sorry
but
you
can
understand
after
what
occurred
he
came
suddenly
forward
the
water
trickling
from
him
on
to
the
carpet
you
swear
that
true
she
could
see
now
his
face
and
realised
that
he
was
indeed
desperate
breathless
as
though
he
had
been
running
from
some
one
yes
that
true
she
answered
maggie
said
that
those
were
maggie
words
oh
well
i
done
he
turned
away
from
her
as
though
her
announcement
had
settled
something
about
which
he
had
been
in
doubt
it
is
like
maggie
but
still
she
has
written
she
saw
i
was
hard
up
last
time
all
i
deserve
all
i
deserve
he
turned
round
to
grace
again
i
ca
quite
believe
it
miss
trenchard
it
sound
like
maggie
but
perhaps
you
influenced
her
that
likely
if
she
should
change
her
mind
i
at
the
dog
not
much
of
a
place
quiet
though
yes
well
you
might
tell
her
not
to
bother
finished
you
see
miss
trenchard
yes
down
you
be
glad
to
hear
it
i
no
doubt
well
i
must
stay
talking
i
wish
maggie
were
happier
though
she
is
happy
is
she
the
question
was
so
abrupt
that
grace
was
startled
i
should
hope
so
cardinal
she
said
oh
no
she
is
i
know
always
this
religion
she
gets
into
if
it
is
one
sort
it
another
but
she
a
good
girl
do
you
forget
that
well
i
must
be
going
good
day
good
day
he
was
actually
gone
leaving
a
little
pool
of
water
on
the
carpet
behind
him
grace
sat
down
on
the
sofa
again
what
a
horrible
man
what
a
horrible
man
but
she
had
been
wrong
to
say
that
about
maggie
yes
she
had
but
he
had
taken
her
by
surprise
oh
dear
how
her
heart
was
beating
and
how
strange
he
had
looked
she
could
scarcely
breathe
she
sat
there
lost
in
stupefied
wonder
at
last
tea
came
in
and
with
it
paul
and
maggie
grace
felt
ashamed
and
frightened
why
was
maggie
always
making
her
do
things
of
which
she
was
ashamed
it
was
as
though
the
girl
had
power
over
her
absurd
of
course
nevertheless
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
she
was
haunted
by
that
man
eyes
yes
he
had
undoubtedly
been
very
unhappy
yes
in
great
trouble
maggie
sat
quietly
there
paul
was
preoccupied
with
a
letter
that
must
he
had
decided
be
written
to
the
church
times
it
was
a
letter
about
churchwardens
and
their
growing
independence
he
finished
his
tea
hurriedly
but
before
he
left
the
room
looking
at
maggie
rather
wistfully
suddenly
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
she
glanced
up
at
him
smiling
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
grace
she
asked
then
as
it
were
without
her
own
desire
grace
was
compelled
to
speak
there
something
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
began
awkwardly
then
she
stopped
maggie
was
troubled
she
knew
that
when
grace
was
uncomfortable
every
one
else
was
uncomfortable
what
have
i
done
now
she
said
rather
sharply
it
nothing
that
you
done
answered
grace
also
sharply
i
sure
i
do
know
maggie
why
you
should
always
think
that
i
scolding
you
no
i
do
indeed
it
nothing
that
you
done
your
uncle
came
to
see
you
this
afternoon
uncle
mathew
maggie
jumped
up
from
her
chair
came
here
yes
and
wanted
to
see
me
oh
grace
why
did
you
tell
me
i
have
told
you
there
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
maggie
really
you
need
look
like
that
as
though
i
were
always
doing
something
wrong
i
only
did
it
for
your
sake
for
my
sake
but
why
i
wanted
to
see
him
i
was
trying
to
see
him
in
london
oh
grace
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
say
well
fancy
as
though
i
could
remember
he
said
come
to
see
you
and
when
i
said
he
could
he
went
away
again
said
he
could
but
why
could
he
really
maggie
your
tone
is
extraordinary
fancy
what
paul
would
say
if
he
heard
you
he
would
like
it
i
sure
i
said
that
after
the
way
he
behaved
last
time
he
came
here
you
did
want
to
see
him
again
you
said
that
oh
grace
how
did
you
dare
now
maggie
do
you
look
like
that
i
done
nothing
i
sure
did
you
say
that
i
said
that
i
did
want
to
see
him
again
grace
shrank
back
behind
the
yes
i
did
maggie
you
frighten
me
i
hope
i
do
you
wicked
you
wicked
yes
you
are
where
is
he
now
he
at
the
dog
that
dirty
public
house
on
the
near
tunstalls
where
are
you
going
i
going
to
him
of
course
maggie
turned
and
looked
at
grace
grace
was
fascinated
as
a
rabbit
is
by
a
snake
the
two
women
stared
at
one
another
how
strange
you
are
grace
maggie
said
you
seem
to
like
to
be
cruel
then
she
went
out
when
the
door
was
closed
grace
found
that
she
was
all
in
a
perspiration
her
hand
trembled
so
that
when
she
tried
to
pour
herself
another
cup
of
tea
just
to
fortify
herself
she
poured
it
into
the
saucer
and
the
tea
was
cold
no
use
now
when
she
rose
at
last
to
go
in
and
seek
consolation
from
paul
her
knees
were
trembling
so
that
she
staggered
across
the
floor
this
could
go
on
no
it
could
not
to
be
frightened
in
one
own
house
absurd
really
the
girl
had
looked
terrible
murder
that
what
it
had
looked
like
something
must
be
done
murmuring
aloud
to
herself
again
and
again
something
must
be
done
as
she
crossed
the
hall
she
walked
slowly
her
hand
to
her
heart
ponderously
as
though
she
were
walking
in
the
dark
then
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
the
study
door
she
began
before
she
could
see
her
brother
oh
paul
i
so
frightened
it
maggie
she
very
angry
fancy
what
she
said
maggie
meanwhile
had
gone
straight
up
to
her
bedroom
and
found
her
black
hat
and
her
waterproof
her
one
thought
now
was
lest
he
should
have
caught
the
five
train
and
gone
back
to
london
oh
how
hurt
he
would
be
with
her
how
terribly
hurt
the
thought
of
the
pain
and
loneliness
that
he
would
feel
distressed
her
so
bitterly
that
she
could
scarcely
put
on
her
hat
she
was
so
eager
to
run
and
find
him
she
felt
at
the
thought
of
his
fruitless
journey
through
the
rain
the
tenderest
affection
for
him
maternal
and
loving
so
that
she
wanted
to
have
him
with
her
at
once
and
to
see
him
in
warm
clothes
beside
the
fire
drinking
whisky
if
he
liked
and
she
would
give
him
all
the
money
she
possessed
she
had
still
touched
very
little
of
her
own
three
hundred
pounds
he
should
have
as
much
of
that
as
he
liked
the
death
of
aunt
anne
had
shown
her
how
few
people
in
the
world
there
were
for
her
to
love
after
all
the
aunts
and
uncle
mathew
had
needed
her
as
no
one
else
had
done
she
made
little
plans
she
would
perhaps
go
back
with
him
to
london
for
a
little
time
there
was
after
all
no
reason
why
she
should
remain
in
this
horrible
place
for
ever
and
paul
now
seemed
not
to
care
whether
she
went
or
stayed
she
ran
out
into
the
wind
and
the
rain
she
was
surprised
by
the
force
and
fury
of
it
it
would
take
time
and
strength
to
battle
down
the
high
street
poor
uncle
mathew
to
walk
all
the
way
in
the
rain
and
then
to
be
told
that
she
would
not
see
him
she
could
imagine
him
turning
away
down
the
drive
bitterly
disappointed
probably
he
had
come
to
borrow
money
and
she
had
promised
that
she
would
not
fail
him
when
she
reached
the
high
street
she
was
soaked
she
felt
the
water
dripping
down
her
neck
and
in
her
boots
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
by
the
bookseller
she
was
forced
to
pause
so
fiercely
did
the
wind
beat
up
from
the
otterson
road
that
runs
openly
to
the
sea
maggie
had
not
even
in
glebeshire
known
so
furious
a
day
and
hour
when
the
winds
tossed
and
raged
but
never
broke
into
real
storm
it
was
the
more
surprising
she
had
to
pause
for
a
moment
to
remember
where
turnstall
the
butcher
was
then
suddenly
recalling
it
she
turned
off
the
high
street
and
found
her
way
to
the
mean
streets
that
ran
behind
the
promenade
still
she
met
no
one
it
might
have
been
a
town
abandoned
by
all
human
life
and
given
over
to
the
wind
and
rain
and
the
approaching
absorption
of
the
sea
it
was
now
dark
and
the
lamp
at
the
end
of
the
street
blew
gustily
and
with
an
uncertain
flare
maggie
found
turnstall
its
shop
lit
and
turnstall
himself
stout
and
behind
his
bloody
counter
she
went
in
and
asked
him
where
the
sea
dog
might
be
he
explained
to
her
that
it
was
close
at
hand
on
the
right
looking
over
the
promenade
she
found
it
at
last
because
it
had
an
creaking
wooden
sign
with
a
blue
sailor
painted
on
it
timidly
she
stepped
into
the
dark
uneven
passage
to
the
right
of
her
she
could
see
a
deserted
room
with
wooden
trestles
and
a
table
the
bar
must
be
near
because
she
could
hear
voices
and
the
clinking
of
glasses
but
in
spite
of
those
sounds
the
house
seemed
very
dead
through
the
walls
and
rooms
she
could
hear
the
pounding
beat
of
the
sea
she
walked
to
the
end
of
the
passage
and
there
found
an
old
wrinkled
man
in
riding
breeches
and
a
check
shirt
can
you
tell
me
where
a
gentleman
cardinal
is
staying
she
asked
he
was
obviously
very
deaf
she
had
to
shout
she
repeated
her
question
adding
he
came
from
london
a
stout
woman
appeared
what
is
it
she
asked
the
old
man
stone
deaf
he
ca
hear
at
all
i
was
wondering
said
maggie
whether
you
could
tell
me
where
i
could
find
a
cardinal
he
came
down
from
london
and
is
staying
here
cardinal
cardinal
the
woman
thought
scratching
her
head
was
it
caldwell
you
meant
no
said
maggie
cardinal
i
go
and
see
the
woman
disappeared
whilst
the
old
man
brushed
past
maggie
as
though
she
were
a
piece
of
furniture
he
departed
on
some
secret
purpose
of
his
own
what
a
horrible
place
thought
maggie
uncle
must
be
in
a
bad
way
if
he
comes
here
i
never
should
sleep
for
the
noise
of
the
sea
the
woman
returned
yes
here
no
come
this
afternoon
up
the
stairs
and
second
door
on
the
right
the
stairs
to
which
she
pointed
offered
a
gulf
of
darkness
the
woman
was
gone
the
noises
from
the
bar
had
ceased
the
only
sound
in
the
place
was
the
thundering
of
the
sea
roaring
as
it
seemed
at
the
very
foot
of
the
house
maggie
climbed
the
stairs
up
she
was
compelled
to
pause
the
darkness
blinded
her
she
had
lost
the
reflection
from
the
lamp
below
and
above
her
there
was
no
light
at
all
she
advanced
slowly
step
by
step
feeling
her
way
with
a
hand
on
the
rickety
bannisters
at
the
top
of
the
stair
there
was
a
gleam
of
light
and
turning
to
the
right
she
knocked
on
the
second
door
there
was
no
answer
and
she
knocked
again
listening
the
noise
of
the
sea
was
now
so
violent
that
she
fancied
that
she
might
not
have
heard
the
answer
so
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
pushed
it
open
she
was
met
then
by
a
gale
of
wind
a
rush
of
the
sea
that
seemed
as
imminent
as
though
she
were
on
the
shore
itself
and
a
dim
grey
light
that
revealed
nothing
in
the
room
to
her
but
only
shapes
and
shadows
she
knew
at
once
that
the
windows
must
be
wide
open
she
could
hear
some
papers
rustling
and
something
on
the
wall
tapped
monotonously
uncle
mathew
she
whispered
and
then
she
called
more
loudly
uncle
mathew
uncle
mathew
there
was
no
answer
and
suddenly
a
strange
quite
unreasoning
terror
caught
her
by
the
throat
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
not
to
cry
out
and
run
down
to
the
passage
she
held
herself
there
by
sheer
force
the
smell
of
the
sea
was
now
very
strong
there
was
a
tang
of
rotten
seaweed
in
it
as
she
remained
there
she
could
see
more
clearly
but
it
seemed
that
the
room
was
full
of
some
dim
obscuring
mist
she
moved
forward
into
the
room
knocked
her
knee
against
a
table
and
then
as
the
panic
gained
upon
her
called
more
loudly
uncle
uncle
are
you
in
where
are
you
it
i
maggie
oh
well
of
course
he
is
here
she
said
to
herself
downstairs
and
yet
strangely
something
seemed
to
persuade
her
that
he
was
there
it
was
as
though
he
were
maliciously
hiding
from
her
to
tease
her
feeling
her
way
cautiously
her
hands
before
her
face
she
moved
forward
to
close
the
windows
thinking
that
she
must
shut
out
that
abominable
sound
of
the
sea
and
the
stale
stink
of
the
seaweed
she
was
suddenly
caught
by
a
sweep
of
rain
that
wetted
her
hair
and
face
and
neck
she
started
back
and
touched
a
piece
of
damp
cloth
she
turned
and
there
very
close
to
her
but
above
her
and
staring
over
her
head
was
uncle
mathew
face
it
was
so
close
to
her
that
she
could
have
touched
it
by
putting
up
her
hand
it
was
and
she
would
not
have
seen
it
at
all
had
she
not
been
very
near
to
it
she
realised
nothing
but
she
felt
that
her
knees
were
trembling
and
that
she
would
fall
if
she
did
not
steady
herself
she
put
out
her
hand
and
clutched
damp
heavy
thick
cloth
cloth
that
enwrapped
as
it
seemed
some
weighty
substance
like
stone
or
brick
she
passed
her
hand
upwards
and
suddenly
the
damp
cloth
gave
way
beneath
her
fingers
sinking
inwards
against
something
soft
and
flabby
she
sprang
away
she
stood
for
one
shuddering
moment
then
she
screamed
again
and
again
shrieking
and
running
as
it
were
for
her
life
out
of
the
room
down
the
passage
she
could
not
find
the
staircase
oh
she
could
not
find
the
staircase
she
stood
there
leaning
against
the
damp
wall
crying
oh
help
help
quickly
there
were
steps
and
voices
then
the
woman
whom
she
had
seen
before
appeared
at
the
turn
of
the
stair
holding
a
lamp
what
is
it
she
asked
raising
the
light
high
maggie
did
not
answer
only
leaning
there
and
staring
down
you
better
come
bill
the
woman
said
there
something
wrong
up
the
woman
came
up
the
stairs
followed
by
two
men
they
moved
cautiously
as
though
they
expected
to
find
something
terrible
round
the
next
corner
what
is
it
said
the
woman
again
when
she
came
up
to
maggie
but
maggie
made
no
answer
they
pushed
past
her
and
went
into
the
room
maggie
followed
them
she
saw
the
room
obscured
by
mist
she
heard
some
whispering
and
fumbling
then
a
match
was
struck
there
was
a
flare
followed
suddenly
by
the
flaming
of
a
candle
in
the
quick
light
the
room
was
bright
maggie
saw
her
uncle
hanging
from
some
projection
in
the
rough
ceiling
a
chair
was
overturned
at
his
feet
his
body
was
like
a
bag
of
old
clothes
his
big
boots
turning
inwards
towards
one
another
his
face
was
a
dull
grey
and
seemed
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
his
body
by
the
thick
blue
muffler
that
encircled
his
neck
he
was
grinning
at
her
the
tip
of
his
tongue
protruded
at
her
between
his
teeth
she
noticed
his
hands
that
hung
heavily
like
dead
fish
after
that
she
knew
no
more
save
that
the
sea
seemed
to
rush
in
a
great
flood
with
a
sudden
vindictive
roar
into
the
room
chapter
ix
soul
of
paul
nothing
so
horrible
had
ever
happened
to
paul
before
nothing
he
felt
as
though
he
had
committed
a
murder
it
was
as
though
he
expected
arrest
and
started
at
every
knock
on
the
door
nothing
so
horrible
it
was
of
course
in
all
the
skeaton
papers
at
the
inquest
it
appeared
that
mathew
cardinal
had
imitated
the
signature
of
a
prosperous
city
friend
had
he
not
chosen
his
own
way
out
he
would
have
discovered
the
arduous
delights
of
hard
labour
but
he
had
chosen
suicide
and
not
while
of
unsound
mind
yes
the
uncle
of
the
wife
yes
the
rector
wife
uncle
yes
the
rector
uncle
sho
discovered
him
bumped
right
into
him
in
the
dark
what
a
queer
story
like
a
novel
oh
but
she
had
always
been
queer
trenchard
had
picked
her
up
somewhere
in
a
london
slum
well
perhaps
not
a
slum
exactly
but
something
very
like
it
why
did
he
marry
her
perhaps
he
had
to
who
knows
these
clergymen
are
sly
dogs
always
the
worst
if
the
truth
were
known
so
it
went
on
for
nine
whole
days
and
nights
it
was
the
only
topic
in
skeaton
paul
caught
the
fringe
of
it
he
had
never
known
very
much
about
his
he
had
always
taken
the
things
that
they
said
to
him
as
the
true
things
when
they
smiled
he
had
thought
that
they
meant
their
smiles
and
why
not
since
he
always
meant
his
he
had
always
been
too
lazy
to
dislike
people
and
his
digestion
had
been
too
good
and
his
ambition
too
slender
to
urge
him
towards
spite
and
malice
he
had
believed
that
he
was
on
excellent
terms
with
all
the
world
now
that
was
changed
he
was
watched
he
knew
with
curious
inquisitive
critical
glances
through
no
fault
of
his
own
he
was
soiled
and
smirched
that
hearty
confident
laugh
of
his
must
be
checked
he
was
afraid
yes
he
was
afraid
he
sat
in
his
study
and
trembled
at
the
thought
of
meeting
his
congregation
he
had
done
nothing
and
yet
his
reputation
was
no
longer
clean
but
he
was
afraid
also
of
something
else
he
saw
desperately
against
his
will
the
central
picture
he
saw
the
body
hanging
in
the
dark
room
maggie
tumbling
against
it
the
cries
the
lights
the
crowd
he
saw
it
all
hour
after
hour
he
was
not
an
imaginative
man
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
actually
been
present
at
this
scene
he
had
to
attend
the
inquest
that
had
been
horrible
with
all
eyes
upon
him
he
stood
up
and
answered
their
detestable
questions
he
had
trembled
before
those
eyes
suddenly
the
of
all
his
life
had
left
him
he
had
stammered
in
his
replies
his
hands
had
trembled
and
he
had
been
forced
to
press
them
close
to
his
sides
he
had
given
his
answers
as
though
he
were
a
guilty
man
he
came
then
slowly
in
the
silence
of
his
study
to
the
consideration
of
grace
and
maggie
this
would
kill
grace
she
had
altered
in
a
few
days
amazingly
she
would
meet
nobody
but
shut
herself
into
her
bedroom
she
would
not
see
the
servants
she
looked
at
paul
as
though
she
like
the
rest
of
the
world
blamed
him
paul
loved
grace
he
had
not
known
before
how
much
they
had
been
together
all
their
lives
and
he
had
taken
her
protection
and
care
of
him
too
much
for
granted
how
good
she
had
been
to
him
and
for
how
many
years
when
they
were
happy
it
seemed
natural
that
she
should
look
after
him
but
now
in
the
middle
of
this
scandal
he
saw
that
it
should
have
been
he
who
looked
after
her
he
had
not
looked
after
her
of
course
now
they
would
have
to
leave
skeaton
and
he
knew
what
that
departure
would
mean
to
grace
she
was
suspicious
of
new
places
and
new
people
strange
to
think
now
that
almost
the
only
person
of
whom
she
had
not
been
suspicious
was
maggie
maggie
his
mind
slowly
wheeled
round
to
her
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
clumsily
to
parade
the
room
he
walked
up
and
down
the
study
as
though
with
closed
eyes
his
large
body
bumping
against
corners
of
tables
and
chairs
maggie
he
looked
back
as
of
late
he
had
often
done
to
those
days
in
his
cousin
house
in
london
what
had
happened
to
the
maggie
whom
he
had
known
there
he
saw
her
again
so
quiet
so
ready
to
listen
and
learn
so
modest
and
yet
with
a
humour
and
sense
of
appreciation
that
had
promised
well
for
the
future
a
child
an
ignorant
charming
uneducated
child
that
is
what
she
had
seemed
he
admitted
now
that
his
heart
always
too
soft
and
too
gentle
perhaps
had
been
touched
beyond
wisdom
she
had
seemed
to
need
just
the
protection
and
advice
that
he
had
been
fitted
to
give
her
then
as
though
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
change
had
been
made
from
the
moment
of
entering
into
skeaton
there
had
been
a
new
maggie
he
could
not
tell
himself
because
he
was
not
a
man
clever
at
psychology
in
what
the
change
consisted
had
he
been
pressed
he
would
have
said
perhaps
that
he
had
known
the
old
maggie
intimately
that
nothing
that
she
could
say
or
do
astonished
him
but
that
this
new
maggie
was
altogether
a
stranger
time
had
not
altered
that
with
the
passing
months
he
had
known
her
less
and
less
why
at
their
first
meeting
long
ago
in
katherine
house
he
had
known
her
better
than
he
knew
her
now
he
traced
the
steps
of
their
history
in
skeaton
she
had
eluded
him
always
never
allowing
him
to
hold
her
for
more
than
a
moment
vanishing
and
appearing
again
fantastic
in
some
strange
lighted
distance
hurting
him
and
disappointing
him
he
stopped
in
his
walk
bewildered
he
saw
with
a
sudden
flash
that
she
had
never
appeared
so
fascinating
to
him
as
when
she
had
been
strangest
he
saw
it
now
at
the
moment
when
she
seemed
more
darkly
strange
more
sinister
and
dangerous
than
ever
before
he
realised
too
at
the
same
sharp
moment
the
conflict
in
which
he
was
engaged
on
the
one
side
was
all
his
life
his
sloth
and
ease
and
comfort
his
religion
his
good
name
his
easy
intercourse
with
his
grace
intellectual
laziness
acceptance
of
things
as
they
most
easily
are
skeaton
regular
meals
good
drainage
moral
physical
and
spiritual
a
good
funeral
and
a
favourable
obituary
in
the
skeaton
times
on
the
other
hand
unrest
separation
from
grace
an
elusive
and
pursuit
scandal
and
possible
loss
of
religion
unhappiness
at
least
it
was
to
his
credit
that
he
realised
the
conflict
it
is
even
further
to
his
credit
that
he
grasped
and
admitted
the
hopelessness
of
it
he
knew
which
way
he
would
go
even
now
he
was
tired
with
the
thought
of
the
struggle
he
sank
into
his
shabby
chair
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
his
hand
stretched
out
instinctively
for
an
easy
volume
but
oh
maggie
how
strange
and
fascinating
at
that
moment
she
appeared
to
him
with
her
odd
silences
her
flashes
of
startled
surprise
her
sense
of
being
half
the
day
in
another
world
her
kindness
to
him
and
then
her
sudden
terror
of
him
her
ignorance
and
then
the
conviction
that
she
gave
suddenly
to
him
that
she
knew
more
than
he
would
ever
know
above
all
the
way
that
some
dark
spirit
deep
down
in
him
supported
her
wild
rebellions
her
irreverences
her
irreligion
her
scorn
of
tradition
oh
she
was
a
witch
grace
word
for
her
was
right
but
not
grace
sense
of
it
the
more
grace
was
shocked
the
more
tempting
to
him
the
witch
became
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
day
in
katherine
so
slight
a
thing
when
she
had
said
that
she
did
not
love
him
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
he
could
change
that
how
could
a
child
so
raw
and
ignorant
resist
such
a
man
and
yet
she
had
resisted
that
resistance
had
been
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
whichever
way
things
went
now
he
was
a
defeated
man
the
door
opened
and
grace
came
in
looking
at
her
he
realised
that
she
would
never
understand
the
struggle
through
which
he
had
been
timorously
wading
and
saw
that
she
was
further
away
from
him
than
she
had
ever
been
before
he
blamed
her
too
she
had
had
no
right
to
refuse
that
man
to
maggie
had
she
allowed
maggie
to
see
him
none
of
this
might
have
occurred
the
man
was
a
forger
and
would
had
he
lived
have
gone
to
prison
but
there
would
not
then
have
been
the
same
open
scandal
no
he
blamed
grace
it
might
be
that
their
old
absolutely
confident
intimacy
would
never
be
renewed
he
felt
cold
and
lonely
he
bent
forward
putting
some
coal
on
the
fire
breaking
it
up
into
a
cheerful
blaze
then
he
looked
up
at
her
and
his
heart
was
touched
she
looked
an
old
woman
her
hair
was
untidy
and
her
face
was
dull
grey
in
colour
her
eyes
moved
restlessly
round
the
room
wandering
from
picture
to
picture
from
the
mantelpiece
to
the
chairs
from
the
chairs
to
the
as
though
she
sought
in
the
sight
of
these
things
some
defence
and
security
is
your
head
better
he
asked
her
not
meeting
her
eyes
because
the
dull
pain
in
them
disturbed
him
not
much
she
said
it
very
bad
my
head
i
taken
aspirin
i
did
eat
anything
yesterday
nothing
at
all
except
some
bread
and
milk
and
very
little
of
that
i
could
finish
it
i
felt
i
be
sick
i
said
to
emily
if
i
eat
any
more
of
that
i
be
sick
and
emily
advised
me
not
to
touch
it
what
i
mean
is
that
if
i
eaten
any
more
i
have
been
really
sick
at
least
that
what
i
felt
like
her
restless
eyes
came
suddenly
to
a
jerking
pause
as
though
some
one
had
caught
and
gripped
them
she
was
suddenly
dramatic
oh
paul
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
cried
paul
was
irritated
by
that
he
hated
to
be
asked
direct
questions
as
to
policy
what
do
you
mean
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
asked
why
about
this
about
everything
we
shall
have
to
leave
skeaton
you
know
fancy
what
people
are
saying
suddenly
as
though
the
thought
of
the
scandal
was
too
much
for
her
her
knees
gave
way
and
she
flopped
into
a
chair
well
let
them
say
he
answered
vigorously
grace
you
making
too
much
of
all
this
you
be
ill
if
you
are
careful
pull
yourself
together
of
course
we
got
to
go
she
answered
if
you
think
that
we
can
go
on
living
here
after
all
that
happened
well
why
not
he
interrupted
we
have
done
anything
it
only
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
it
was
one
of
grace
most
irritating
habits
that
she
finished
other
people
sentences
for
them
in
a
way
that
they
had
not
intended
that
if
they
look
at
it
properly
they
see
that
it
was
our
fault
but
will
they
look
at
it
properly
of
course
they
wo
you
know
what
cats
they
are
only
waiting
for
a
chance
what
i
mean
is
that
this
is
just
the
chance
they
been
waiting
for
how
can
you
go
on
and
every
time
you
preach
they
be
looking
up
at
you
and
saying
a
brother
of
a
murderer
why
fancy
what
feel
paul
jumped
in
his
chair
what
do
you
mean
grace
the
brother
of
a
murderer
what
else
am
i
grace
began
to
warm
her
podgy
hands
it
came
out
at
the
inquest
that
i
would
see
the
man
did
it
maggie
thinks
me
a
murderer
i
see
it
in
her
eyes
every
time
what
i
mean
to
say
paul
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
maggie
grace
voice
changed
at
that
question
it
was
as
though
that
other
trouble
of
the
scandal
were
nothing
to
her
compared
with
this
matter
of
maggie
presence
paul
turned
and
looked
at
her
she
dropped
her
voice
to
a
whisper
and
went
on
i
wo
stay
with
maggie
any
more
no
no
no
you
must
choose
paul
between
maggie
and
me
what
i
mean
is
that
it
simply
is
safe
in
the
same
house
with
her
you
may
not
have
noticed
it
yourself
but
seen
it
coming
on
a
long
time
i
have
indeed
she
is
right
in
her
head
and
she
hates
me
she
always
hated
me
she
like
to
do
me
an
injury
she
follows
me
round
the
house
she
always
watching
me
and
now
that
she
thinks
that
i
killed
her
uncle
it
worse
i
not
safe
paul
and
that
the
truth
she
hides
in
my
room
behind
the
curtains
waiting
for
me
it
my
safety
you
got
to
consider
it
me
or
her
i
know
she
your
wife
but
what
i
mean
is
that
there
be
something
awful
happening
if
you
are
careful
grace
as
she
spoke
was
a
woman
in
the
very
heart
of
a
desperate
panic
her
whole
body
trembled
her
face
was
transfixed
as
though
she
saw
maggie
standing
in
front
of
her
there
with
a
knife
no
one
looking
at
her
could
deny
that
she
was
in
mortal
terror
no
affectation
here
and
paul
loved
her
he
came
over
to
her
and
put
his
arm
round
her
she
caught
hold
of
his
hand
clutched
it
desperately
when
he
felt
the
trembling
of
her
body
beneath
his
hand
his
love
for
her
and
protective
care
of
her
overwhelmed
him
grace
dear
it
all
right
he
said
you
exaggerating
all
this
maggie
would
hurt
a
fly
indeed
she
would
she
has
her
faults
perhaps
but
cruelty
is
one
of
them
you
must
remember
that
had
a
bad
time
lately
losing
her
aunt
and
then
finding
her
uncle
in
that
horrible
way
after
all
she
only
a
child
i
know
that
you
two
have
got
on
well
together
and
i
daresay
that
it
has
been
very
largely
my
fault
but
you
must
be
frightened
like
that
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
so
long
as
i
am
alive
no
harm
whatever
but
she
stared
in
front
of
her
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
repeating
no
no
paul
either
she
goes
or
i
go
she
your
wife
she
must
stay
then
i
must
go
i
ca
stand
it
i
ca
indeed
i
not
sleeping
not
indeed
it
is
fair
to
ask
it
what
i
mean
is
that
it
is
fair
to
me
although
he
had
known
grace
for
years
he
still
believed
her
threats
and
promises
my
sister
an
obstinate
woman
he
would
say
although
had
he
looked
truly
into
his
experience
he
must
have
seen
that
she
changed
her
mind
more
frequently
by
far
than
she
changed
her
clothes
he
thought
that
now
she
meant
what
she
said
indeed
on
his
own
side
he
really
did
not
see
how
in
the
future
maggie
and
grace
could
continue
to
live
in
the
same
house
but
as
grace
had
said
he
was
married
to
maggie
and
therefore
it
was
grace
that
must
go
then
when
he
confronted
the
fact
of
grace
departure
he
could
not
endure
it
no
he
could
not
had
maggie
been
everything
to
him
that
she
might
have
been
bad
she
been
his
true
wife
had
she
loved
him
had
she
oh
a
thousand
things
she
might
have
been
then
perhaps
life
would
be
possible
without
grace
but
now
at
the
thought
of
being
alone
for
ever
with
maggie
a
strange
passion
mingled
of
fascination
and
fear
affection
and
sensuality
cowardice
and
excitement
pervaded
him
what
would
their
life
together
be
then
he
turned
to
grace
as
the
very
rock
of
his
safety
oh
grace
you
must
go
you
must
think
of
going
whatever
should
i
do
without
you
a
dull
flush
of
gratification
coloured
her
cheeks
either
she
goes
or
i
she
repeated
it
ca
go
on
you
must
see
that
it
ca
fancy
what
people
must
be
thinking
as
always
he
postponed
the
issue
we
settle
something
do
you
worry
dear
you
go
and
lie
down
that
what
you
want
a
thorough
good
rest
she
plodded
off
for
himself
he
decided
that
fresh
air
was
what
he
needed
he
went
for
a
stroll
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
charleston
road
that
led
to
the
high
street
he
was
pleased
with
the
day
early
spring
mild
faint
haze
trees
dimly
purple
a
bird
clucking
the
whisper
of
the
sea
stirring
the
warm
puddles
and
rivulets
across
the
damp
dim
road
warm
yes
warm
and
promising
lent
tiresome
long
services
gloomy
sermons
rebuking
people
scolding
them
made
them
angry
did
them
no
good
then
easter
that
was
better
jolly
hymns
christ
is
risen
christ
is
risen
jolly
flowers
primroses
crocuses
no
they
were
earlier
they
have
forgotten
about
maggie
uncle
by
then
live
it
down
that
the
thing
give
them
a
good
genial
sermon
this
sunday
show
them
he
was
caring
if
only
the
women
would
get
on
together
women
women
how
difficult
they
were
yes
sunday
would
be
difficult
facing
them
all
he
knew
what
they
be
thinking
he
wanted
to
be
jolly
again
jolly
that
was
the
thing
joking
with
grace
jolly
even
with
maggie
jolly
with
his
congregation
jolly
with
god
why
was
he
left
alone
had
been
until
maggie
came
maggie
like
a
stone
flung
into
a
frosty
pool
broke
everything
up
simply
because
she
was
unlike
other
people
he
married
her
because
he
thought
he
could
make
her
into
what
he
pleased
well
it
had
been
the
other
way
oh
she
was
queer
queer
queer
he
stopped
his
large
boots
in
a
warm
puddle
he
felt
the
warm
sun
hot
through
the
damp
mist
he
wanted
to
take
her
into
his
arms
to
hug
her
above
all
to
feel
her
response
to
feel
her
response
that
was
what
for
years
now
he
had
been
wanting
and
never
once
had
she
responded
never
once
she
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
but
she
was
passive
she
did
love
him
grace
loved
him
but
how
dull
grace
was
dull
it
was
all
dull
grace
was
dull
skeaton
was
dull
the
church
was
dull
god
was
dull
god
where
was
god
he
looked
around
there
was
no
god
to
what
had
he
been
praying
all
these
years
he
had
not
been
praying
his
congregation
had
not
been
praying
they
were
all
dead
and
god
was
dead
too
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
his
boots
were
in
a
puddle
he
walked
on
for
a
moment
the
mists
of
sloth
and
that
had
for
years
obscured
his
vision
had
shifted
and
cleared
but
even
as
he
moved
they
settled
down
and
resolved
themselves
once
more
the
muscles
of
soul
were
stiff
with
disuse
training
is
a
lengthy
affair
and
a
tiresome
business
to
the
stout
and
the
hedges
gave
way
to
houses
he
was
in
the
high
street
he
saw
then
plastered
at
intervals
on
the
hoardings
strange
phenomena
it
was
the
colour
that
first
attracted
him
a
bright
indecent
pink
with
huge
black
lettering
because
it
was
the
offseason
in
skeaton
other
announcements
were
few
all
the
more
prominent
then
the
following
the
kingscote
beetheen
will
hold
a
religious
festival
in
the
town
of
from
april
to
special
song
service
daily
all
are
cordially
invited
addresses
by
rev
john
thurston
rev
william
crashaw
sister
avies
paul
stared
at
this
placard
with
horror
and
disgust
in
his
soul
for
the
moment
maggie
and
grace
and
all
the
scandal
connected
with
them
was
forgotten
this
was
terrible
by
temperament
tradition
training
he
loathed
and
feared
every
phase
of
religion
known
to
him
as
methodistic
under
this
term
he
included
everything
that
was
noisy
demonstrative
and
melodramatic
once
when
an
undergraduate
at
cambridge
he
had
gone
to
some
meeting
of
the
kind
there
had
been
impromptu
prayers
ghastly
pictures
of
appeals
to
the
undergraduates
to
save
themselves
at
once
lest
it
be
too
late
confessions
and
appeals
for
mercy
the
memory
of
that
evening
still
filled
him
with
physical
nausea
it
was
to
him
as
though
he
had
seen
some
gross
indecent
act
in
public
or
witnessed
some
horrible
cruelty
maggie
had
told
him
very
little
about
the
chapel
and
its
doings
and
he
had
shrunk
from
asking
her
any
questions
but
everything
that
was
odd
and
unusual
in
her
behaviour
he
attributed
to
her
months
under
that
influence
as
he
stared
at
the
flaunting
pink
sheet
he
felt
as
though
it
were
a
direct
personal
assault
on
himself
and
his
church
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
could
do
nothing
once
before
there
had
been
something
of
the
kind
in
skeaton
and
he
had
tried
with
others
to
stop
it
he
had
failed
utterly
the
civic
authorities
in
skeaton
seemed
almost
to
approve
of
these
horrors
he
looked
at
the
thing
once
more
and
then
turned
back
towards
home
something
must
be
done
something
must
be
done
but
as
on
so
many
earlier
occasions
in
his
life
he
could
face
no
clear
course
of
action
that
saturday
evening
he
tried
to
change
his
sermon
he
had
determined
to
deliver
a
very
fine
address
on
brotherly
love
and
then
most
fortunately
he
had
discovered
a
old
sermon
that
would
with
a
little
adaptation
exactly
fit
the
situation
he
was
sick
of
his
adaptation
the
sermon
had
not
been
a
good
one
at
the
first
and
now
it
was
a
tattered
thing
of
shreds
and
patches
he
tried
to
add
to
it
some
sentences
about
the
approaching
revival
no
sentences
would
come
what
a
horrible
fortnight
it
had
been
he
looked
back
upon
his
district
visiting
his
meetings
his
with
disgust
something
had
come
in
between
himself
and
his
people
perhaps
the
relationship
had
never
been
very
real
founded
on
jollity
an
eagerness
to
accept
anybody
mood
for
one
own
if
only
that
meant
jollity
what
had
he
thought
standing
in
the
puddle
that
afternoon
that
they
were
all
dead
he
and
his
congregation
and
god
all
dead
together
he
sank
into
his
chair
picked
up
the
church
times
and
fell
asleep
next
morning
as
he
walked
into
the
choir
this
extraordinary
impression
that
his
congregation
was
dead
persisted
as
he
recited
the
confession
he
looked
about
him
there
was
maxse
and
there
miss
purves
every
one
was
in
his
and
her
appointed
place
old
colonel
rideout
with
the
purple
gills
not

yes
there

maggie
kneeling
side
by
side
maggie
his
eyes
rested
upon
her
her
face
suddenly
struck
him
as
being
of
extraordinary
beauty
he
had
never
thought
her
beautiful
before
very
plain
of
course
every
one
knew
that
she
was
plain
but
her
face
and
profile
had
the
simplicity
the
purity
the
courage
of
a
madonna
in
one
of
the
old
pictures
or
rather
of
one
of
those
john
the
baptist
boys
gazing
up
into
the
face
of
the
christ
child
as
it
lay
in
its
mother
arms
he
finished
the
confession
hurriedly
maggie
face
faded
from
his
view
he
saw
now
only
a
garden
of
hats
and
heads
the
bright
varnished
colour
of
the
church
around
and
about
them
all
he
gave
out
the
psalms
there
was
a
rustle
of
leaves
and
soon
shrill
untrained
voices
of
the
were
screaming
the
chant
like
a
number
of
baby
in
competition
when
he
climbed
into
the
pulpit
he
tried
again
to
discover
face
as
he
had
already
seen
it
he
could
not
it
had
been
perhaps
a
trick
of
light
and
in
any
case
she
was
hidden
now
behind
the
stout
stolidity
of
grace
he
looked
around
at
the
other
faces
beneath
him
and
saw
them
settle
themselves
into
their
customary
expressions
of
torpor
vacuity
and
expectation
very
little
expectation
they
knew
well
enough
by
this
time
the
kind
of
thing
to
expect
from
him
the
turn
of
phrase
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
voice
the
pause
dramatic
the
whisper
expostulatory
the
thrust
imperative
the
smile
seductive
he
had
often
been
told
as
a
curate
that
he
was
a
wonderful
preacher
his
round
jolly
face
his
beaming
smile
a
certain
dramatic
gift
had
helped
him
he
is
so
human
he
had
heard
people
say
for
many
years
he
had
lived
on
that
phrase
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
this
morning
he
distrusted
his
gift
he
was
out
of
touch
with
them
all
because
they
were
dead
killed
by
forms
and
repetitions
and
monotony
we
all
dead
you
know
and
i
dead
too
let
close
the
doors
and
seal
this
church
up
our
day
is
over
he
said
of
course
nothing
of
the
kind
his
sermon
was
stupid
halting
and
ineffective
naturally
as
colonel
rideout
said
over
his
port
at
lunch
when
a
feller
wife
uncle
has
just
hung
himself
in
public
so
to
speak
it
does
take
the
wind
out
of
you
he
use
to
preach
badly
once
got
stale
they
all
do
as
paul
dismissed
the
congregation
with
the
blessing
he
felt
that
everything
was
over
he
was
more
completely
miserable
than
he
had
ever
been
he
had
in
fact
never
before
been
really
miserable
except
when
he
had
the
toothache
and
now
also
the
custom
of
years
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
miserable
for
long
he
had
had
no
real
talk
with
maggie
since
the
inquest
maggie
came
into
his
study
that
afternoon
their
conversation
was
very
quiet
and
undemonstrative
it
happened
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
conversations
in
both
their
lives
and
often
afterwards
paul
looked
back
to
it
trying
to
retrace
in
it
the
sentences
and
movements
with
which
it
had
been
built
up
he
could
never
recover
anything
very
much
he
could
see
maggie
sitting
in
a
way
that
she
had
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
looking
at
him
and
looking
also
far
beyond
him
he
knew
afterwards
that
this
was
the
last
moment
in
his
life
that
he
had
any
contact
with
her
like
a
witch
like
a
ghost
she
had
come
into
his
life
like
a
witch
like
a
ghost
she
went
out
of
it
leaving
him
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
a
haunted
man
as
he
looked
at
her
he
realised
that
she
had
aged
in
this
last
fortnight
yes
that
horrible
affair
had
taken
it
out
of
her
she
seemed
to
have
recovered
at
some
strange
and
unnatural
cost
as
though
she
had
taken
some
potion
or
drug
she
began
by
asking
grace
question
paul
what
are
we
going
to
do
but
she
did
not
irritate
him
as
grace
had
done
his
one
idea
was
to
help
her
unfortunately
he
had
himself
thought
out
nothing
clearly
well
maggie
he
answered
smiling
i
thought
you
might
help
me
about
that
i
want
your
advice
i
thought
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
settled
anything
but
i
thought
that
i
might
get
a
locum
for
a
month
or
two
and
we
might
go
abroad
for
a
trip
perhaps
to
paris
or
venice
or
somewhere
and
then
come
back
she
asked
for
a
time
yes
certainly
he
answered
i
do
think
i
can
ever
come
back
to
skeaton
she
said
in
a
whisper
as
though
speaking
to
herself
he
could
see
that
she
was
controlling
herself
and
steadying
her
voice
with
the
greatest
difficulty
of
course
i
must
come
paul
if
you
want
me
to
it
been
all
my
fault
from
the
very
beginning
oh
no
he
broke
in
it
has
yes
it
has
i
just
spoilt
your
life
and
grace
you
were
both
very
happy
until
i
came
i
had
no
right
to
marry
you
when
i
did
love
you
i
did
know
then
all
i
know
now
but
that
no
excuse
i
should
have
known
i
was
younger
than
most
girls
are
though
paul
said
but
maggie
you
not
to
blame
yourself
at
all
i
think
if
we
were
somewhere
else
than
skeaton
it
would
be
easier
and
now
after
what
has
happened
maggie
broke
in
you
could
leave
skeaton
paul
you
know
you
could
it
would
just
break
your
heart
all
the
work
of
your
life
has
been
here
everything
you
ever
done
and
grace
too
no
no
you
wrong
said
paul
vigorously
a
change
is
probably
what
i
need
i
been
too
long
in
the
same
place
time
goes
so
fast
that
one
does
realise
and
for
grace
too
i
expect
a
change
will
be
better
and
do
you
think
said
maggie
that
grace
will
ever
live
with
me
now
in
the
same
house
when
she
knows
that
i
driven
you
from
skeaton
grace
is
quite
right
she
just
to
feel
as
she
does
about
me
then
grace
must
go
said
paul
firmly
looking
at
maggie
and
feeling
that
the
one
thing
that
he
needed
was
that
she
should
be
in
his
arms
and
he
kissing
her
maggie
if
we
go
away
you
and
i
right
away
from
all
of
this
perhaps
then
you
can
you
will
he
stopped
she
shook
her
head
never
paul
never
do
you
know
what
i
seen
this
last
week
that
i
left
all
those
who
really
wanted
me
my
aunts
very
much
they
needed
me
and
i
was
selfish
and
would
give
them
what
they
wanted
and
tried
to
escape
from
them
you
and
grace
do
need
me
nobody
wants
anything
here
in
skeaton
you
all
full
it
is
my
fault
paul
but
everything
seems
to
me
dead
here
they
do
mean
anything
they
say
in
church
and
the
church
does
mean
anything
either
the
chapel
was
wrong
in
london
too
but
it
was
more
right
than
the
church
here
is
i
do
know
what
religion
is
or
where
it
is
i
do
know
anything
now
except
that
one
ought
to
be
with
the
people
who
want
one
and
not
with
the
people
who
do
aunt
wanted
me
and
i
failed
her
uncle
wanted
me
and
i
i
i
she
broke
down
crying
her
head
in
her
arms
he
went
over
to
her
and
put
his
arms
around
her
at
his
touch
she
shrank
a
little
and
when
he
felt
that
he
went
away
from
her
and
stood
silently
not
knowing
what
to
do
maggie
do
do
maggie
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
cry
i
done
all
wrong
i
done
all
wrong
she
answered
him
been
wrong
always
his
helplessness
was
intolerable
he
knew
that
she
would
not
allow
him
to
touch
her
he
went
out
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
chapter
x
the
revival
maggie
cried
for
a
little
while
then
slowly
recovering
realised
that
she
was
alone
in
the
room
she
raised
her
head
and
listened
then
she
dried
her
eyes
and
stood
up
wondering
what
she
should
do
next
during
the
last
week
she
had
spent
all
her
energy
on
one
thing
alone
to
keep
back
from
her
the
picture
of
uncle
mathew
death
that
at
all
costs
she
must
not
see
there
it
was
just
behind
her
hovering
with
all
its
detail
at
her
elbow
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
she
was
conscious
of
it
there
but
she
would
not
turn
and
look
uncle
mathew
was
dead
that
was
all
that
she
must
know
aunt
anne
was
dead
too
martin
had
written
to
her
and
then
because
she
had
not
answered
had
abandoned
her
paul
and
grace
were
to
be
driven
out
of
skeaton
because
of
her
grace
hated
her
paul
would
never
love
her
unless
she
in
return
would
love
him
and
that
she
would
never
do
because
she
loved
martin
she
was
alone
then
she
had
made
every
one
unhappy
aunt
anne
uncle
mathew
paul
grace
the
best
thing
that
she
could
do
now
was
to
go
away
and
hide
herself
somewhere
that
at
least
she
saw
very
clearly
and
she
clung
to
it
if
she
went
away
paul
and
grace
need
not
leave
skeaton
soon
they
would
forget
her
and
be
happy
once
more
as
they
had
been
before
she
came
but
where
should
she
go
all
her
life
she
had
depended
upon
her
own
but
now
that
had
left
her
she
felt
as
though
she
could
not
move
unless
there
was
some
one
somewhere
who
cared
for
her
but
there
was
no
one
katherine
mark
no
she
certainly
could
never
go
there
again
behind
all
this
was
the
constant
preoccupation
that
she
must
not
look
for
an
instant
at
uncle
mathew
death
if
she
did
everything
would
break
she
must
not
she
must
not
she
must
not
she
went
up
to
her
bedroom
took
from
their
box
martin
letters
and
the
ring
with
the
three
pearls
and
the
tattered
programme
she
sat
on
her
bed
and
turned
them
over
and
over
she
was
bewildered
and
scarcely
knew
where
she
was
she
repeated
again
and
again
i
must
go
away
at
once
i
must
go
away
at
once
then
as
though
moved
by
some
compelling
force
that
she
did
not
recognise
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
crying
martin
martin
i
want
you
i
do
know
where
you
are
but
i
must
find
you
martin
tell
me
where
you
are
i
go
to
you
anywhere
martin
where
are
you
where
are
you
it
may
not
have
been
a
vocal
cry
perhaps
she
made
no
sound
but
she
waited
there
on
her
knees
hearing
very
clearly
the
bells
ringing
for
evening
service
and
seeing
the
evening
sun
steal
across
her
carpet
and
touch
gently
the
pictures
on
the
wall
gradually
as
she
knelt
there
calm
and
reassurance
came
back
to
her
she
felt
as
though
he
somewhere
lost
in
the
world
had
heard
her
she
laid
her
cheek
upon
the
quilt
of
the
bed
and
for
the
first
time
since
uncle
mathew
death
her
thoughts
worked
in
connected
order
her
courage
returned
to
her
and
she
saw
the
room
and
the
sun
and
the
trees
beyond
the
window
as
real
objects
without
the
mist
of
terror
and
despair
that
had
hitherto
surrounded
her
she
rose
from
her
knees
as
though
she
were
withdrawing
from
a
horrible
nightmare
she
could
remember
nothing
of
the
events
of
the
last
week
save
her
talk
with
paul
that
afternoon
she
could
recall
nothing
of
the
inquest
nor
whether
she
had
been
to
church
nor
any
scene
with
grace
so
long
as
i
alive
and
martin
alive
it
all
right
she
thought
she
knew
that
he
was
alive
she
would
find
him
she
put
away
the
things
into
the
box
again
she
had
not
yet
thought
what
she
would
do
but
in
some
way
she
had
received
during
those
few
minutes
in
her
room
a
reassurance
that
she
was
not
alone
she
went
out
into
the
spring
dusk
she
chose
the
road
towards
barnham
wood
because
it
was
lonely
there
and
the
hedges
were
thin
you
could
feel
the
breath
of
the
sea
as
it
blew
across
the
sparse
fields
the
hush
of
an
english
sunday
evening
enfolded
the
road
the
wood
the
fields
the
sun
was
very
low
and
the
saffron
light
penetrated
the
dark
lines
of
the
hedges
and
hung
like
a
curtain
of
misty
gold
before
the
approaches
to
the
wood
the
fields
rolled
to
the
horizon
and
lay
like
a
carpet
at
the
foot
of
the
town
huddled
against
the
pale
sky
she
was
near
the
wood
and
could
see
the
little
dark
twisted
paths
that
led
into
the
purple
depths
when
a
woman
came
out
of
it
towards
her
she
saw
that
it
was
miss
toms
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
see
her
there
because
it
was
on
this
same
road
that
she
had
first
met
the
lady
and
her
brother
miss
toms
also
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
she
shook
maggie
warmly
by
the
hand
you
said
that
i
would
come
often
to
see
you
said
maggie
and
it
been
true
things
have
been
more
difficult
for
me
than
i
knew
at
the
time
that
all
right
said
miss
toms
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
said
maggie
that
although
i
have
been
to
see
you
i
felt
as
though
you
and
your
brother
were
my
friends
more
than
any
one
in
this
place
and
that
been
a
great
help
to
me
they
started
to
walk
down
the
road
together
you
been
in
trouble
said
miss
toms
of
course
i
heard
about
it
i
would
have
liked
to
come
and
see
you
but
i
did
know
how
your
would
like
it
she
put
her
arm
through
maggie
my
dear
she
said
do
be
discouraged
because
skeaton
is
dead
it
does
mean
that
all
the
world
is
and
remember
this
the
world
view
of
any
one
is
never
the
right
one
i
know
that
the
world
thinks
my
brother
mad
but
i
know
that
he
a
lot
saner
than
most
people
the
world
thinks
your
uncle
was
a
rascal
but
if
you
can
remember
one
good
thing
he
did
you
know
he
was
and
i
sure
you
can
remember
many
good
things
it
is
that
said
maggie
it
is
that
i
seem
to
have
done
everything
wrong
and
made
every
one
i
had
to
do
with
unhappy
nonsense
said
miss
toms
i
sure
if
they
been
unhappy
their
own
fault
is
the
evening
air
lovely
at
times
like
these
i
wonder
that
skeaton
can
dare
to
exist
you
come
and
see
us
one
day
wo
you
i
think
i
do
know
said
maggie
i
may
be
going
away
miss
toms
gave
her
a
penetrating
look
i
daresay
you
right
skeaton
not
the
place
for
you
i
saw
that
the
first
time
we
met
well
whatever
you
do
do
lose
your
pluck
you
yourself
you
know
and
you
as
good
as
anybody
else
you
forget
that
because
a
lot
of
people
say
a
thing
it
does
mean
it
true
and
because
a
set
of
idiots
think
a
thing
shocking
it
does
mean
that
it
shocking
think
how
wrong
people
have
always
been
about
everything
they
turned
down
a
side
lane
and
arrived
in
the
high
street
the
street
was
very
empty
in
the
fading
light
a
large
pink
poster
attracted
maggie
attention
she
went
close
to
it
and
read
the
announcement
of
the
revival
services
when
she
read
the
names
of
thurston
and
crashaw
and
miss
avies
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
and
then
at
the
same
time
as
something
that
she
had
always
expected
oh
she
cried
it
coming
here
she
was
strangely
startled
as
though
the
sign
of
thurston
name
was
strange
forewarning
what
coming
asked
miss
toms
she
read
the
notice
i
do
know
what
you
think
said
miss
toms
but
that
kind
of
thing
humbug
if
you
ask
me
oh
maggie
cried
it
so
strange
i
knew
those
people
in
london
i
used
to
go
to
their
services
and
now
they
coming
here
she
could
not
explain
to
miss
toms
the
mysterious
assurance
that
she
had
of
the
way
that
her
former
world
was
drawing
near
to
her
again
she
could
see
now
that
never
for
a
moment
since
her
arrival
in
skeaton
had
it
let
her
alone
slowly
invading
her
bit
by
bit
driving
in
upon
her
forcing
her
to
retire
it
was
quite
dark
now
because
it
was
sunday
evening
the
shops
were
closed
only
behind
some
of
the
curtained
windows
dim
lights
burned
very
clearly
the
sea
could
be
heard
breaking
upon
the
shore
the
last
note
of
the
bell
from
the
methodist
chapel
echoed
across
the
roofs
and
stones
said
miss
toms
said
maggie
she
turned
back
towards
home
hearing
as
she
went
thurston
voice
seeing
beyond
all
the
thick
shadow
of
martin
body
keeping
pace
with
her
as
it
seemed
step
by
step
with
her
as
she
went
she
turned
into
the
rectory
drive
she
heard
with
a
startled
shiver
the
long
gate
swing
screaming
behind
her
she
could
smell
very
faintly
the
leaves
of
the
damp
cold
laurel
bushes
that
pressed
close
in
upon
her
it
was
as
though
some
one
were
walking
with
her
and
whispering
in
her
ear
they
coming
they
coming
they
got
you
they
got
you
she
opened
the
hall
door
the
hall
was
all
dark
some
one
was
there
maggie
gave
a
little
cry
a
match
was
struck
and
revealed
the
white
face
of
grace
the
two
women
stared
at
one
another
grace
had
returned
from
church
she
was
wearing
her
ugly
black
hat
with
the
red
velvet
it
all
right
said
maggie
i
been
for
a
walk
oh
i
did
know
gasped
grace
still
staring
i
thought
yes
of
course
fancy
you
been
for
a
walk
still
staring
as
though
she
could
keep
maggie
at
bay
only
by
the
power
of
her
vision
she
backed
on
to
paul
study
door
turned
the
handle
and
disappeared
the
hall
was
in
darkness
again
maggie
stumbled
her
way
towards
the
staircase
then
seeing
grace
terrified
eyes
filled
with
a
horror
that
she
maggie
cardinal
should
cause
any
one
to
look
at
her
like
that
she
ran
clumsily
upstairs
shutting
herself
into
her
bedroom
during
the
next
fortnight
the
dominant
element
in
the
situation
was
grace
terror
skeaton
was
already
beginning
to
forget
the
story
of
the
suicide
maggie
was
marked
for
ever
now
as
queer
and
strange
but
paul
was
not
blamed
he
was
rather
pitied
and
even
liked
the
more
but
grace
could
not
forget
maggie
intended
perhaps
to
murder
her
in
revenge
for
her
uncle
death
well
then
she
must
be
murdered
she
would
not
leave
her
brother
she
could
not
consider
the
future
she
knew
that
she
could
not
live
in
the
same
house
with
maggie
for
long
but
she
would
not
go
and
maggie
would
not
go
what
was
to
happen
poor
grace
the
tortures
that
she
suffered
during
those
weeks
will
not
be
understood
by
persons
with
and
a
hearty
contempt
for
superstition
she
paid
the
penalty
now
for
the
ghosts
of
her
childhood
and
no
one
could
help
her
maggie
saw
that
paul
was
with
every
day
increasingly
unhappy
he
had
never
been
trained
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
although
he
tried
now
he
succeeded
very
badly
he
would
come
into
her
room
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
lie
down
beside
her
he
would
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kiss
her
and
desperately
as
though
he
were
doing
it
for
a
wager
make
love
to
her
she
felt
desperate
also
on
her
side
that
she
could
comfort
and
make
him
happy
if
only
he
would
want
something
less
from
her
than
passion
but
always
after
an
hour
or
a
little
more
he
crept
away
again
to
his
own
room
disappointed
angered
frustrated
these
hours
were
the
stranger
because
during
the
day
he
showed
her
nothing
of
this
mood
but
was
kindly
and
friendly
and
distant
she
would
have
done
anything
for
him
she
tried
sometimes
to
be
affectionate
to
him
but
always
at
once
he
turned
upon
her
with
a
hungry
impassioned
look
she
knew
without
any
kind
of
doubt
that
the
only
way
that
she
could
make
him
happy
again
was
to
leave
him
his
was
not
a
nature
to
brood
for
the
rest
of
his
days
on
something
that
he
had
lost
only
once
did
he
make
any
allusion
to
the
coming
revival
services
he
burst
out
one
day
at
luncheon
the
most
scandalous
thing
he
said
we
had
them
here
once
years
ago
and
the
harm
they
did
no
one
would
believe
i
been
to
tamar
about
it
he
can
do
nothing
unless
they
disturb
the
public
peace
of
course
he
had
the
impertinence
to
tell
me
that
they
behaved
very
well
last
time
they
were
here
i
do
like
that
man
said
grace
i
do
believe
he
makes
his
money
properly
look
at
the
clothes
tamar
wears
what
i
mean
is
i
do
like
his
wife
at
all
it
very
hard
said
paul
his
voice
trembling
with
indignation
that
when
men
and
women
have
been
working
for
years
to
bring
christ
into
the
hearts
of
mankind
that
mountebanks
and
hypocrites
should
be
allowed
to
undo
the
work
in
the
space
of
a
night
i
know
this
man
thurston
they
had
letters
in
the
church
times
about
him
fancy
said
grace
and
still
he
dares
show
his
face
but
do
they
really
do
so
much
harm
asked
maggie
i
should
have
thought
if
they
only
came
once
for
a
week
in
ten
years
they
make
any
real
effect
on
anybody
maggie
dear
said
paul
gently
you
do
understand
as
the
day
of
the
revival
approached
maggie
knew
that
she
would
go
to
one
of
the
services
she
was
now
in
a
strange
state
of
excitement
the
shock
of
her
uncle
death
had
undoubtedly
shaken
her
whole
balance
moral
physical
and
mental
the
fortnight
that
had
followed
it
when
she
had
clung
like
a
man
falling
from
a
height
and
held
by
a
rocky
ledge
to
the
one
determination
not
to
look
either
behind
or
in
front
of
her
had
been
a
strain
beyond
her
strength
she
did
not
know
she
did
not
feel
any
weakness
she
felt
rather
a
curious
atmosphere
of
light
and
expectation
as
though
that
cry
to
martin
in
her
bedroom
had
truly
been
answered
and
she
felt
more
than
this
old
magnus
had
once
said
to
her
i
do
know
what
religion
is
except
that
it
is
a
fight
and
some
people
join
in
because
they
want
to
some
are
forced
to
join
in
whether
they
want
to
or
no
some
just
leave
it
alone
and
some
most
do
know
there
one
going
on
at
all
but
if
you
do
join
in
you
seem
to
me
to
have
wasted
your
time
she
had
not
understood
in
the
least
what
he
meant
she
did
not
understand
now
but
thinking
of
his
words
it
did
seem
to
her
that
she
was
sharing
in
some
conflict
the
vast
armies
hidden
from
her
by
mist
the
contested
ground
also
hidden
but
the
clash
of
arms
clearly
to
be
heard
her
own
part
of
a
struggle
seemed
to
be
round
her
love
for
martin
it
was
as
though
if
she
could
get
some
realisation
of
that
she
would
have
won
her
way
to
a
whence
she
could
visualise
the
next
place
she
did
not
think
this
out
she
only
felt
in
her
heart
a
little
less
lonely
a
little
less
wicked
and
selfish
a
little
less
deserted
as
though
she
were
drawing
nearer
to
some
hidden
fire
and
could
feel
the
first
warm
shadow
of
the
flames
she
made
one
more
appeal
to
grace
on
the
very
morning
of
the
first
day
of
the
revival
after
breakfast
maggie
came
into
the
and
found
grace
sitting
there
sewing
she
stood
timidly
in
her
old
attitude
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
like
a
child
saying
her
lesson
i
beg
your
pardon
grace
grace
looked
up
she
had
of
course
been
conscious
of
maggie
ever
since
her
entrance
into
the
room
her
hands
had
trembled
and
her
heart
leapt
furiously
why
maggie
she
said
i
afraid
i
disturbing
you
said
maggie
but
we
have
really
said
anything
to
one
another
for
the
last
fortnight
i
do
suppose
that
you
want
me
to
say
anything
now
but
things
get
worse
and
worse
if
no
one
says
anything
do
they
now
that
she
had
begun
she
went
on
quickly
i
wanted
to
say
grace
how
sorry
i
am
for
the
trouble
and
unhappiness
that
you
and
paul
have
had
during
the
last
fortnight
through
me
i
been
nothing
but
a
trouble
to
you
since
i
first
came
here
but
it
was
that
that
i
wanted
to
say
i
could
bear
that
you
should
think
that
i
was
just
selfishly
full
of
my
own
affairs
and
did
understand
how
you
and
paul
must
feel
about
about
my
uncle
not
that
i
mean
she
went
on
rather
fiercely
raising
her
head
that
he
was
to
blame
no
one
ever
understood
him
he
could
have
done
great
things
if
if
some
one
had
looked
after
him
a
little
but
he
any
one
that
was
my
fault
i
did
want
you
and
paul
to
think
i
blame
myself
i
do
all
the
time
i
ca
promise
to
be
better
in
the
future
because
i
promised
so
often
and
i
never
am
but
i
am
sorry
grace
said
nothing
for
a
moment
her
hands
trembled
more
than
ever
then
without
looking
up
she
murmured
as
though
to
her
sewing
oh
no
maggie
no
one
blames
you
i
sure
there
was
another
pause
then
grace
said
i
think
i
not
well
no
i
ca
be
well
because
i
not
sleeping
although
i
taken
aspirin
more
i
sure
than
i
ought
to
what
i
mean
is
that
they
say
it
bad
for
your
heart
of
course
things
have
been
very
unfortunate
from
the
beginning
one
might
say
but
i
sure
it
not
been
any
one
fault
exactly
what
i
mean
is
that
these
things
never
are
no
they
are
really
i
expect
we
all
want
a
change
what
are
you
frightened
of
me
for
grace
asked
maggie
grace
started
as
though
maggie
had
indeed
dropped
a
bomb
at
her
feet
she
looked
up
at
maggie
wildly
her
eyes
staring
about
the
room
as
though
she
were
looking
for
some
exit
of
escape
frightened
she
repeated
yes
you
are
said
maggie
that
what
worries
me
most
no
ever
been
frightened
of
me
before
at
least
i
do
think
any
one
has
maggie
laughed
why
grace
it
seems
so
funny
any
one
being
frightened
of
me
i
could
hurt
any
one
if
i
wanted
to
and
i
sure
i
never
want
to
unless
it
maxse
be
angry
with
me
as
much
as
you
like
grace
but
do
be
frightened
of
me
why
that
ridiculous
it
was
the
worst
word
to
have
chosen
grace
flushed
a
dull
unwholesome
purple
i
sorry
you
think
me
ridiculous
maggie
she
said
perhaps
i
am
i
sure
i
do
know
yes
perhaps
i
am
what
i
mean
is
that
ridiculous
to
one
is
not
ridiculous
to
another
you
a
strange
girl
maggie
and
you
and
i
will
never
get
on
no
never
but
all
i
ask
is
that
you
should
make
paul
happy
that
is
enough
for
me
i
care
for
nothing
else
he
is
very
happy
just
now
what
i
mean
is
that
any
one
can
see
he
is
eating
his
meals
properly
oh
grace
cried
maggie
i
did
mean
that
you
were
ridiculous
i
meant
that
any
one
being
frightened
of
me
was
ridiculous
anyway
very
sorry
that
i
made
you
and
paul
unhappy
that
all
she
turned
and
went
it
was
the
most
lovely
of
april
days
soft
the
gently
tempered
by
sun
maggie
sat
at
her
bedroom
window
overlooking
the
drive
and
the
field
that
ran
to
the
woods
she
knew
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
her
escape
to
the
revival
meeting
paul
had
arranged
that
there
should
be
an
evening
service
at
the
church
at
the
same
hour
an
act
of
rather
defiance
maggie
sat
there
looking
down
in
a
condition
of
strange
bewildering
excitement
on
to
the
laurel
bushes
it
was
wonderful
to
think
that
in
another
she
would
see
miss
avies
once
more
hear
those
wild
hymns
again
catch
the
stridency
of
thurston
voice
all
these
things
spoke
of
martin
she
felt
as
though
he
were
stealing
towards
her
out
of
the
dusk
it
was
as
though
without
any
reason
she
expected
to
find
him
at
the
service
although
she
knew
that
he
could
not
be
there
she
heard
the
church
bell
begin
to
ring
then
the
opened
and
paul
came
out
he
had
on
his
soft
black
hat
he
was
carrying
his
bible
and
under
his
arm
he
stood
for
a
moment
beside
the
as
though
he
were
listening
or
expecting
something
she
had
a
strange
impulse
to
run
down
to
him
so
strong
was
it
that
she
got
up
and
moved
to
the
door
then
slowly
she
came
back
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
down
upon
him
suddenly
as
though
he
felt
her
gaze
he
glanced
up
saw
her
and
waved
to
her
she
waved
back
to
him
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
away
she
heard
the
gate
swing
screaming
behind
him
she
waited
for
a
little
then
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
she
knew
the
flower
street
hall
a
place
occasionally
used
by
touring
companies
wandering
lecturers
charitable
concerts
and
other
casual
festivals
it
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
town
towards
the
end
of
the
promenade
the
town
dim
in
the
first
dusk
hummed
with
loiterers
girls
released
from
the
shops
walking
with
their
young
men
couples
sauntering
out
to
take
a
last
whiff
of
the
sea
before
going
in
to
the
evening
meal
one
or
two
visitors
from
the
hotel
strolling
across
to
the
beach
to
watch
the
first
evening
stars
and
the
rising
moon
pianos
were
playing
children
shouting
over
the
last
game
of
the
day
all
hushed
into
a
coloured
mild
tranquillity
in
the
fields
beyond
the
houses
the
quiet
was
absolute
maggie
found
the
building
the
facade
was
blazing
with
electric
light
a
huge
poster
of
the
now
familiar
pink
declared
grand
religious
festival
all
are
invited
is
all
well
with
you
brother
there
was
a
crowd
about
the
doors
and
continually
with
giggles
and
shamefaced
laughter
couples
broke
away
and
climbed
the
steps
into
the
hall
maggie
feeling
that
all
eyes
were
upon
her
entered
the
building
in
the
vestibule
two
women
in
black
bonnets
handed
papers
with
prayers
and
hymns
to
every
newcomer
maggie
took
hers
a
door
was
opened
in
front
of
her
and
she
went
in
the
auditorium
was
a
large
one
semicircular
in
shape
with
tiers
of
seats
rising
to
a
ceiling
decorated
with
silver
stars
and
pink
naked
cherubs
the
stage
had
upon
it
a
table
some
chairs
and
a
draped
in
crimson
cloth
below
the
stage
was
a
small
orchestra
consisting
of
two
fiddles
a
cornet
drum
and
a
piano
there
was
also
what
seemed
to
maggie
a
small
choir
some
women
dressed
in
white
and
some
men
in
black
coats
and
white
bow
ties
across
the
stage
were
suspended
broad
white
bands
of
cloth
with
come
to
jesus
come
now
he
is
waiting
for
you
in
big
black
letters
the
hall
seemed
very
full
and
was
violently
illuminated
with
electric
light
maggie
took
this
in
as
she
stood
very
timidly
just
inside
the
door
a
steward
came
forward
and
showed
her
a
she
saw
then
with
a
dramatic
flash
of
recognition
thurston
and
crashaw
sitting
behind
the
table
then
with
a
still
stranger
emotion
miss
avies
as
one
of
the
choir
the
sight
of
those
three
familiar
faces
seemed
to
close
finally
and
definitely
the
impression
that
she
had
had
during
all
those
last
weeks
they
had
got
her
again
and
yet
not
they
but
the
power
behind
them
it
seemed
only
five
minutes
ago
that
she
had
sat
in
the
london
chapel
and
heard
old
crashaw
scream
punishment
punishment
punishment
she
turned
half
in
her
seat
as
though
she
expected
to
see
aunt
anne
and
aunt
elizabeth
sitting
one
on
either
side
of
her
she
looked
at
thurston
he
had
coarsened
very
much
since
she
had
seen
him
last
he
was
fatter
his
cheeks
stained
with
an
unnaturally
high
colour
his
eyes
brighter
and
sharper
and
yet
sensual
too
he
was
smarter
than
he
had
been
his
white
bow
tie
stiff
and
shapely
his
cuffs
clean
and
shining
his
hair
very
carefully
brushed
back
from
his
high
and
bony
forehead
his
sharp
eyes
darted
all
over
the
building
and
maggie
felt
as
though
at
any
moment
she
would
be
discovered
crashaw
looked
more
like
a
decrepit
monkey
than
ever
huddled
up
in
his
chair
his
back
he
breathed
into
his
hands
as
though
he
wanted
to
warm
them
and
looked
at
nobody
miss
avies
maggie
could
not
see
clearly
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
audience
she
saw
many
townspeople
whom
she
knew
and
she
realised
for
the
first
time
that
tomorrow
everywhere
it
would
be
said
that
the
rector
wife
had
been
at
the
revival
meeting
and
how
different
an
audience
from
the
old
london
one
every
one
had
come
on
this
occasion
to
see
a
show
and
it
was
certainly
a
show
that
they
were
going
to
see
maggie
had
entered
during
a
pause
and
all
the
faces
that
were
there
wore
that
look
of
expectation
that
demands
the
rising
of
the
curtain
soon
maggie
felt
they
would
stamp
and
whistle
did
the
play
not
begin
thurston
rose
and
announced
my
brothers
we
will
sing
hymn
no
on
the
paper
maggie
looked
and
discovered
that
it
was
the
hymn
that
had
once
moved
her
so
dramatically
in
london
with
the
words
by
all
thy
sores
and
bloody
pain
come
down
and
heal
our
sins
again
and
with
the
last
refrain
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
we
beseech
thee
already
in
spite
of
herself
in
spite
of
her
consciousness
of
the
melodrama
and
meretricious
glitter
of
the
scene
her
heart
was
beating
she
was
more
deeply
moved
even
now
than
she
had
ever
been
by
all
the
services
of
the
skeaton
church
and
thurston
had
learnt
his
job
by
this
time
softly
one
of
the
violins
played
the
tune
then
thurston
said
the
first
verse
of
this
hymn
will
be
sung
by
the
choir
alone
the
congregation
is
asked
to
stand
and
then
to
join
in
the
second
verse
the
fourth
verse
will
be
sung
by
the
soloist
the
audience
rose
there
was
a
hush
of
expectation
throughout
the
building
the
choir
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
fiddlers
alone
sang
the
first
verse
they
had
been
well
selected
and
trained
thurston
obviously
spared
no
expense
for
the
second
verse
the
whole
orchestra
combined
the
drum
booming
through
the
refrain
at
first
the
congregation
was
timid
but
the
tune
was
simple
and
attractive
the
third
verse
was
sung
by
every
one
and
maggie
found
herself
almost
against
her
will
joining
in
at
the
fourth
verse
there
was
again
the
hush
of
expectation
then
a
soprano
thin
and
clear
accompanied
again
by
one
violin
broke
the
silence
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
was
very
moving
men
and
women
sat
down
at
the
hymn
close
quite
visibly
affected
thurston
got
up
then
and
read
a
lesson
from
the
bible
he
read
from
the
revelations
after
this
i
looked
and
behold
a
door
was
opened
in
heaven
and
the
first
voice
which
i
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
me
which
said
come
up
hither
and
i
will
show
thee
things
which
must
be
hereafter
and
immediately
i
was
in
the
spirit
and
behold
a
throne
was
set
in
heaven
and
one
sat
on
the
throne
and
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
stone
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
seats
and
upon
the
seats
i
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
sitting
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
gold
thurston
had
worked
hard
during
these
last
years
he
had
immensely
improved
his
accent
and
his
h
were
all
in
their
right
places
he
read
very
dramatically
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
then
pausing
and
staring
in
front
of
him
as
though
he
saw
god
only
a
few
yards
away
the
people
of
skeaton
had
had
few
opportunities
of
any
dramatic
entertainment
when
thurston
finished
there
passed
through
the
building
a
wave
of
excitement
a
stir
a
faint
murmur
an
old
woman
next
to
maggie
wiped
her
eyes
lovely
maggie
heard
her
whisper
lovely
they
sang
then
another
hymn
accompanied
by
the
orchestra
this
was
a
dramatic
hymn
with
a
fiery
martial
tune
the
lord
of
war
he
cometh
down
with
sword
and
shield
and
armour
bright
his
armies
all
behind
him
frown
who
can
withstand
his
light
chorus
trumpets
blare
the
roll
prepare
to
meet
thy
god
oh
soul
prepare
prepare
prepare
to
meet
thy
god
oh
soul
never
before
had
the
men
and
women
of
skeaton
heard
such
hymns
the
revival
of
ten
years
ago
lacking
the
vibrant
spirit
of
john
thurston
had
been
a
very
different
affair
this
was
something
quite
new
in
all
skeaton
experience
expectation
flamed
now
in
every
eye
maggie
could
feel
that
the
old
woman
next
to
her
was
trembling
all
over
thurston
announced
brother
crashaw
will
now
deliver
an
address
brother
crashaw
his
head
still
lowered
very
slowly
got
up
from
his
seat
he
moved
as
though
it
were
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
and
power
of
that
his
reluctant
body
could
be
compelled
into
action
he
crept
rather
than
walked
from
his
chair
to
the
then
very
very
painfully
climbed
on
to
the
high
platform
maggie
watching
him
remembered
that
earlier
time
when
he
had
climbed
into
just
such
another
desk
she
remembered
also
that
day
at
her
house
when
he
had
flirted
with
caroline
and
shown
himself
quite
another
brother
crashaw
he
had
aged
greatly
since
then
he
seemed
now
to
be
scarcely
a
man
at
all
then
suddenly
with
a
jerk
as
though
a
string
had
been
pulled
from
behind
he
raised
his
face
and
looked
at
them
all
yes
that
was
alive
monkey
mask
you
might
call
it
but
the
eyes
behind
the
yellow
lids
flamed
and
blazed
no
exaggeration
those
words
a
veritable
fire
burned
there
a
fire
it
might
be
of
mere
physical
irritation
and
savage
exasperation
at
the
crumbling
of
the
wilfully
disobedient
body
a
glory
perhaps
of
obstinate
pride
and
conceit
a
fire
of
superstition
and
crass
ignorance
but
a
fire
to
be
doubted
of
no
man
who
looked
upon
it
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
harsher
angrier
more
insulting
than
it
had
been
before
he
spoke
too
in
a
hurry
tumbling
his
words
one
upon
another
as
though
he
were
afraid
that
he
had
little
mortal
time
left
to
him
and
must
make
the
most
of
what
he
had
got
from
the
first
he
was
angry
rating
the
men
of
skeaton
as
they
had
never
been
rated
before
and
they
liked
it
they
even
revelled
in
it
it
did
them
no
harm
and
at
the
same
time
tickled
their
skins
sometimes
a
preacher
at
the
methodist
chapel
had
rated
them
but
how
mild
and
halting
a
scolding
compared
with
the
fury
of
this
little
man
as
he
continued
they
settled
into
their
seats
with
the
conviction
that
this
was
the
best
free
show
that
they
had
ever
enjoyed
in
all
their
lives
they
had
been
afraid
at
first
that
it
would
not
keep
up
its
interest
they
had
agreed
with
one
another
that
they
would
go
in
just
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
see
what
it
was
like
now
they
were
willing
that
it
should
continue
all
night
what
came
ye
out
for
to
see
he
screamed
at
them
came
out
to
see
ye
did
come
out
at
all
none
of
you
that
what
i
come
to
tell
you
for
years
you
been
leading
your
lazy
idle
lives
eating
and
drinking
sleeping
fornicating
lying
with
your
neighbours
wives
buying
and
selling
living
like
hogs
and
swine
and
is
it
for
want
of
your
being
told
not
a
bit
of
it
you
are
warned
again
and
again
and
again
every
day
gives
you
signs
and
wonders
had
you
got
eyes
to
see
them
and
you
will
not
see
well
be
it
on
your
own
heads
why
should
i
care
for
your
miserable
parched
little
souls
why
should
i
care
when
i
watch
you
all
with
your
hanging
stomachs
and
your
double
chins
marching
straight
into
such
a
hell
as
you
never
conceived
of
i
know
what
coming
to
you
i
know
in
store
for
those
stomachs
of
yours
i
can
see
you
writhing
and
screaming
and
wailing
did
somebody
tell
us
why
did
somebody
tell
us
somebody
has
told
you
somebody
telling
you
now
and
will
you
listen
not
a
bit
of
it
you
have
heard
the
music
the
drums
and
the
trumpets
you
have
joined
in
the
singing
and
you
go
back
and
tell
your
friends
we
had
a
fine
evening
you
ought
to
go
it
worth
while
and
costs
you
nothing
and
you
will
have
forgotten
everything
but
i
tell
you
that
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
building
stands
in
as
desperate
peril
as
though
his
house
was
on
fire
over
his
head
and
there
was
no
way
out
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
get
breath
leaning
forward
over
the
desk
and
panting
over
the
building
there
was
a
great
silence
maggie
was
stirred
beyond
any
earlier
experience
she
did
not
know
whether
he
were
charlatan
or
no
she
did
not
care
she
had
lived
for
more
than
two
years
in
skeaton
where
everything
and
every
one
was
dead
now
here
was
life
the
evidence
of
it
reassured
her
whispering
to
her
that
martin
still
lived
that
he
could
be
found
even
that
he
was
coming
to
her
her
nervous
excitement
increased
the
emotion
of
the
people
around
her
the
bands
the
singing
all
seemed
to
cry
to
her
he
is
coming
he
is
coming
he
is
coming
but
it
was
martin
now
and
not
god
old
crashaw
having
recovered
his
breath
went
on
he
continued
for
some
time
to
abuse
them
all
screaming
and
beating
the
wooden
desk
with
his
fists
then
suddenly
he
changed
his
voice
softened
his
eyes
were
milder
there
was
something
wistful
and
pathetic
in
his
old
ugly
yellow
face
i
know
that
you
came
in
here
all
of
you
just
as
you
might
into
a
or
a
theatre
entrance
free
well
then
why
not
had
we
charged
there
would
have
been
one
of
you
and
the
most
important
thing
in
life
i
say
the
most
important
i
say
the
only
important
thing
in
life
a
man
soul
its
history
and
growth
what
do
you
know
of
the
soul
you
ask
me
how
do
you
know
there
is
one
well
i
can
only
tell
you
my
news
if
a
man
comes
into
your
town
and
tells
you
that
there
is
an
army
marching
down
upon
it
to
destroy
it
he
may
be
true
or
he
may
not
if
he
is
true
then
when
you
do
listen
to
him
you
are
doomed
if
you
do
listen
the
preparation
to
meet
that
army
will
at
any
rate
do
you
no
harm
even
though
the
army
does
exist
i
tell
you
that
the
soul
exists
that
god
exists
and
that
one
day
god
and
the
soul
will
meet
you
say
that
has
been
proved
and
until
it
is
proved
you
will
spend
your
time
over
other
things
that
you
know
to
be
true
try
it
at
least
give
it
a
chance
why
not
you
give
other
things
a
chance
marriage
doctors
trades
amusements
why
not
the
soul
do
listen
to
any
one
else
definition
of
religion
believe
in
it
make
your
own
find
out
for
yourself
my
children
i
am
an
old
man
i
am
shortly
to
die
if
i
have
scolded
forgive
me
let
me
leave
with
you
my
blessing
and
my
earnest
prayer
that
you
will
not
pass
by
god
on
the
other
side
the
day
will
come
when
you
can
not
pass
him
by
meet
him
first
of
your
own
accord
and
then
when
that
other
day
comes
he
will
know
you
as
a
friend
the
old
man
voice
faltered
failed
stopped
he
himself
seemed
to
be
deeply
affected
was
it
acting
maggie
could
not
tell
at
any
rate
he
was
old
and
ill
and
very
shortly
to
die
the
woman
next
her
was
crying
rubbing
the
knuckles
of
her
shabby
old
gloves
in
her
eyes
the
bugles
on
her
bonnet
shaking
like
live
things
she
snuffled
through
her
nose
to
maggie
beautiful
beautiful
i
such
preaching
since
i
do
know
when
thurston
again
rose
a
solo
will
now
be
sung
he
said
after
the
singing
of
the
solo
there
will
be
a
prayer
offered
then
a
procession
headed
by
the
choir
will
be
formed
to
march
with
lanterns
through
the
town
as
a
witness
to
the
glory
of
god
it
is
hoped
that
those
of
the
congregation
who
have
received
comfort
and
help
during
this
service
will
join
in
the
procession
there
will
be
a
collection
for
the
expenses
of
the
mission
at
the
door
maggie
watching
him
wondered
of
what
was
he
thinking
was
there
any
truth
in
him
had
he
perhaps
behind
the
sham
display
and
advertisement
that
he
had
been
building
felt
something
stirring
was
he
conscious
against
his
own
will
of
his
falsehood
had
he
while
building
only
his
own
success
made
a
discovery
she
looked
at
him
the
dramatic
mask
hid
him
from
her
she
could
not
tell
what
he
was
the
soprano
who
had
sung
a
verse
of
the
hymn
earlier
in
the
evening
now
undertook
hear
my
prayer
very
beautifully
she
sang
it
hear
my
prayer
oh
god
incline
thine
ear
thyself
from
my
distresses
do
not
hide
the
voice
rose
soaring
through
the
building
to
meet
the
silver
stars
and
the
naked
cherubs
on
the
ceiling
the
enemy
shouteth
the
enemy
shouteth
skeaton
sat
enraptured
women
let
the
tears
stream
down
their
faces
men
blew
their
noses
once
again
the
voice
arose
hear
my
prayer
oh
god
incline
thine
ear
it
was
maggie
voice
maggie
cry
from
the
very
heart
of
the
charlatanism
she
cried
out
appealing
to
a
god
who
might
exist
or
no
she
could
not
tell
but
who
seemed
now
to
be
leading
her
by
the
hand
she
saw
aunt
anne
at
dreot
whispering
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
he
shall
lead
me
in
a
dream
she
shared
in
the
rest
of
the
ceremony
in
a
dream
she
passed
with
the
others
out
of
the
building
the
sea
air
blew
about
her
down
the
promenade
she
could
see
the
people
she
could
see
the
silver
stars
in
the
sky
the
faint
orange
light
of
the
lanterns
the
dim
stretch
of
the
sand
and
then
the
grey
sea
she
heard
the
splash
and
withdrawal
of
the
tide
the
murmur
of
many
voices
the
singing
of
the
distant
hymn
the
blare
of
the
trumpet
strange
and
mysterious
the
wind
blowing
through
it
all
like
a
promise
of
beauty
and
splendour
to
come
she
turned
in
the
starlit
dark
separated
herself
from
the
crowd
and
hurried
home
in
the
hall
on
the
table
under
the
lamp
she
saw
a
letter
she
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
her
and
that
the
writing
was
amy
warlock
before
she
picked
it
up
she
stood
there
listening
the
house
was
very
still
grace
and
paul
had
probably
begun
supper
she
picked
up
the
letter
and
went
up
to
her
bedroom
as
though
she
were
scanning
something
that
she
had
already
seen
she
read
i
made
you
a
promise
and
i
will
now
fulfil
it
my
brother
martin
arrived
in
london
three
days
ago
he
is
staying
at
no
lynton
street
king
cross
i
have
seen
him
but
he
has
told
me
that
he
does
not
wish
to
see
me
again
he
is
very
ill
his
heart
is
bad
and
his
lungs
are
affected
he
has
also
spent
all
his
money
i
mentioned
your
name
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
at
all
interested
i
think
it
fair
to
tell
you
this
lest
you
should
have
a
fruitless
journey
i
have
now
kept
my
promise
to
you
unwisely
perhaps
amy
warlock
maggie
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
considered
there
was
a
train
at
reaching
london
about
midnight
she
could
just
catch
it
if
she
were
quick
she
found
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
dear
paul
i
have
to
go
to
london
suddenly
on
very
urgent
business
i
will
write
to
you
from
there
maggie
she
propped
this
up
against
the
she
put
a
few
things
including
the
box
with
martin
letters
and
the
ring
into
a
little
bag
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
and
went
downstairs
she
waited
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
but
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
she
went
out
down
the
dark
drive
as
she
passed
along
the
lonely
road
she
heard
the
gate
screaming
faintly
behind
her
part
iv
the
journey
home
again
chapter
i
the
dark
room
it
was
after
midnight
when
maggie
was
turned
out
on
to
the
long
grim
platform
of
the
london
station
on
that
other
london
arrival
of
hers
the
terminus
had
been
a
boiling
cauldron
of
roar
and
rattle
now
everything
was
dead
and
asleep
no
trains
moved
they
slept
ancient
monsters
chained
down
with
dirt
and
fog
two
or
three
porters
crept
slothfully
as
though
hypnotised
the
face
of
the
great
clock
golden
in
the
dusk
dominated
like
a
heathen
god
the
scene
maggie
asked
a
porter
the
way
to
the
station
hotel
he
showed
her
she
climbed
stairs
pushed
back
swing
doors
trod
passages
and
arrived
at
a
tired
young
woman
who
told
her
that
she
could
have
a
room
arrived
there
herself
somnambulistic
she
flung
off
her
clothes
crept
into
bed
and
was
instantly
asleep
next
morning
she
kept
to
her
room
she
went
down
the
long
dusty
stairs
before
one
because
she
was
hungry
and
she
discovered
the
restaurant
and
had
a
meal
there
but
all
the
time
she
was
expecting
martin
to
appear
every
step
seemed
to
be
his
every
voice
to
have
an
echo
of
his
tones
then
in
the
dusky
afternoon
she
decided
that
she
would
be
cowardly
no
longer
she
started
off
on
her
search
for
no
lynton
street
king
cross
she
searched
through
a
strange
blue
opaque
light
which
always
afterwards
she
recollected
as
accompanying
her
with
mystery
as
though
it
followed
her
about
deliberately
veiling
her
from
the
rest
of
the
world
she
felt
different
from
them
all
she
found
an
omnibus
that
was
going
to
king
cross
but
when
she
was
inside
it
and
looked
at
the
people
around
her
she
felt
of
them
all
that
they
had
no
reality
beside
the
intensity
of
her
own
search
she
hot
like
a
fiery
coal
existed
in
a
land
of
filmy
ghosts
she
repeated
to
herself
over
and
over
no
lynton
street
king
cross
she
got
out
opposite
the
huge
station
and
looked
about
her
she
saw
a
policeman
and
went
across
to
him
can
you
tell
me
where
lynton
street
is
please
she
asked
him
he
smiled
yes
miss
down
on
your
right
then
first
to
your
right
again
she
thanked
him
and
wanted
for
a
silly
moment
to
remain
with
him
she
wanted
to
stand
there
where
she
was
on
the
island
she
could
go
back
she
was
afraid
to
go
forward
then
the
moment
left
her
and
she
moved
on
when
she
saw
lynton
street
written
up
her
heart
gave
a
strange
little
whirr
and
then
tightened
within
herself
but
she
marched
on
and
found
a
dirty
house
pots
with
ferns
in
the
two
grimy
windows
and
the
walls
streaky
with
white
stains
against
the
grey
the
door
was
ajar
and
pushing
it
a
little
she
saw
a
on
her
knees
scrubbing
the
floor
at
the
noise
of
her
step
the
girl
looked
up
is
warlock
here
maggie
asked
but
the
words
were
choked
in
her
throat
wot
d
sye
the
girl
asked
maggie
repeated
her
question
yes
upstairs
always
is
fust
floor
second
door
on
yer
left
maggie
went
up
she
found
the
door
she
knocked
there
was
no
answer
she
pushed
the
door
peered
through
and
looked
in
she
saw
a
room
with
a
dirty
grimy
window
a
broken
faded
red
sofa
a
deal
table
no
one
there
she
entered
and
stood
listening
a
door
beyond
her
opened
and
a
man
came
in
she
knew
at
once
that
it
was
martin
her
thoughts
followed
one
another
in
strange
flurried
inconsequence
yes
it
was
martin
he
was
fatter
than
he
had
been
fat
and
ill
very
his
face
was
pale
his
hair
thinner
than
before
unbrushed
he
was
wearing
an
old
dirty
blue
suit
with
a
coat
that
buttoned
over
the
waistcoat
like
a
jacket
yes
he
was
ill
and
fat
and
unkempt
but
it
was
martin
at
that
reiterated
assurance
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
she
seemed
to
sink
into
a
marvellous
certain
tranquillity
so
certain
that
she
shed
as
it
were
with
a
gesture
all
the
unhappiness
and
doubt
and
desolation
with
which
the
last
years
had
burdened
her
she
had
touched
martin
again
and
with
that
touch
she
was
safe
it
did
not
matter
how
he
treated
her
nor
whether
he
wanted
her
she
was
sane
and
happy
and
whole
again
as
she
had
not
been
since
he
left
her
meanwhile
he
looked
at
her
across
the
dark
room
frowning
who
is
it
he
asked
what
do
you
want
the
sound
of
his
voice
moved
her
passionately
for
how
long
she
had
ached
and
yearned
for
it
he
spoke
more
huskily
with
a
thicker
tone
than
he
had
done
but
it
was
the
same
voice
rough
a
little
and
slow
do
you
know
me
martin
she
said
laughing
for
sheer
happiness
she
saw
before
she
spoke
that
he
had
recognised
her
he
said
nothing
staring
at
her
across
the
table
and
she
held
by
some
safe
instinct
did
not
move
from
where
she
was
at
last
he
said
well
what
do
you
want
oh
martin
do
you
recognise
me
i
maggie
he
nodded
yes
i
know
you
must
come
here
though
we
nothing
to
say
to
one
another
nowadays
no
nothing
he
did
look
at
her
his
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
grimy
window
she
had
an
astonishing
sense
of
her
possession
of
him
she
laughed
and
came
close
to
the
table
i
not
going
away
martin
not
until
we
had
a
talk
nothing
can
make
me
so
there
he
was
looking
at
her
again
why
you
cut
your
hair
he
said
yes
she
said
then
he
turned
roughly
right
round
upon
her
as
though
he
meant
to
end
the
matter
once
and
for
all
look
here
i
do
mean
what
i
say
he
was
cut
off
then
by
a
fit
of
coughing
he
leant
back
against
the
wall
and
fought
with
it
his
hand
against
his
chest
she
made
no
movement
and
said
no
word
while
the
attack
lasted
he
gasped
recovering
his
breath
then
speaking
in
a
voice
lower
than
before
i
mean
what
i
say
i
do
want
you
i
do
want
any
one
there
nothing
for
us
to
say
to
one
another
it
only
waste
of
time
yes
she
answered
that
your
side
of
the
question
there
also
mine
once
before
you
had
your
own
way
and
i
was
very
miserable
about
it
now
it
my
turn
i
going
to
stay
here
until
we
talked
he
turned
his
face
working
angrily
upon
her
you
ca
stay
here
it
impossible
what
do
you
do
it
for
when
i
tell
you
i
do
want
you
first
my
sister
then
you
come
here
spying
well
now
you
seen
what
it
like
have
you
very
jolly
is
it
very
handsome
you
better
go
away
again
then
you
seen
all
you
wanted
to
i
not
going
away
repeated
maggie
i
did
come
to
spy
you
know
that
of
course
you
can
turn
me
out
but
you
have
to
use
force
oh
no
i
wo
he
answered
there
are
other
ways
he
disappeared
into
the
other
room
a
moment
later
he
returned
he
was
wearing
a
soft
black
hat
and
a
shabby
grey
overcoat
you
get
tired
of
waiting
i
expect
he
said
and
without
looking
at
her
but
just
touching
her
arm
as
he
brushed
past
her
he
left
the
room
she
heard
him
descend
the
stairs
then
the
closed
she
sat
down
upon
the
shabby
red
sofa
and
looked
about
her
what
a
horrible
room
its
darkness
was
tainted
with
a
creeping
coldness
that
seemed
to
steal
in
wavering
gusts
from
wall
to
wall
the
carpet
was
faded
to
a
nondescript
colour
and
was
gashed
into
torn
strips
near
the
fireplace
no
pictures
were
on
the
walls
from
which
the
was
peeling
he
had
done
nothing
whatever
to
make
it
more
habitable
he
must
have
been
staying
there
for
several
weeks
and
yet
there
were
no
signs
of
any
personal
belongings
nothing
of
himself
to
be
seen
nothing
it
was
as
though
in
the
bitterness
of
his
spirit
he
had
said
that
he
would
not
touch
such
a
spot
save
of
necessity
with
his
body
it
should
remain
so
far
as
he
might
go
for
ever
tenantless
she
felt
that
she
seemed
to
be
now
marvellously
perceptive
until
an
hour
ago
she
had
been
lost
ostracised
now
she
was
at
home
again
clear
in
purpose
afraid
of
no
one
and
of
nothing
strangely
although
his
sickness
both
of
body
and
soul
touched
her
to
the
very
depths
of
her
being
her
predominant
sensation
was
of
happiness
she
had
found
him
again
oh
she
had
found
him
again
nothing
in
this
world
or
the
next
counted
in
comparison
with
that
if
she
were
close
to
him
she
would
make
him
well
she
would
make
him
rich
she
would
make
him
happy
where
he
had
been
what
he
had
done
mattered
nothing
where
she
had
been
what
she
had
done
nothing
nothing
in
their
two
lives
counted
but
their
meeting
again
and
she
who
had
been
always
so
shy
and
so
diffident
felt
no
doubt
at
all
about
his
returning
to
her
there
would
be
a
fight
as
she
looked
around
the
gradually
darkening
room
she
realised
that
it
might
be
a
long
fight
and
a
difficult
one
but
that
she
would
win
she
had
no
doubt
it
had
been
preordained
that
she
should
win
no
one
on
this
earth
or
above
it
could
beat
her
gradually
she
became
more
practical
slowly
she
formed
her
plans
first
what
had
martin
done
perhaps
he
had
told
the
woman
of
the
house
that
she
maggie
was
to
be
turned
out
did
she
not
of
herself
go
away
no
martin
would
not
do
that
maggie
knew
quite
confidently
that
he
would
never
allow
any
one
to
insult
her
perhaps
martin
would
not
come
back
at
all
perhaps
his
hat
and
his
coat
were
his
only
possessions
that
was
a
terrible
thought
had
he
gone
leaving
no
trace
how
would
she
ever
find
him
again
she
remembered
then
that
he
had
gone
straight
downstairs
and
out
of
the
house
he
had
not
spoken
to
the
landlady
that
did
not
look
like
a
permanent
departure
but
she
would
make
certain
she
pushed
open
the
other
door
and
peeped
into
the
further
room
she
saw
a
dirty
unmade
bed
a
tin
washhand
stand
and
an
open
filled
with
soiled
linen
no
he
would
come
back
she
sat
there
thinking
out
her
plans
she
was
suddenly
clear
determined
resourceful
all
the
things
that
she
had
never
been
in
her
life
before
first
she
must
see
the
landlady
next
she
must
go
to
the
shops
but
suppose
he
should
return
while
she
was
there
pack
his
bag
and
leave
for
ever
she
must
risk
that
she
thought
that
he
would
not
return
at
once
because
he
would
want
as
he
said
to
tire
her
out
to
tire
her
out
she
laughed
at
that
she
looked
about
the
room
and
decided
how
she
would
improve
it
she
nodded
to
herself
yes
and
the
bedroom
too
all
this
time
she
was
so
happy
that
she
could
scarcely
prevent
herself
from
singing
aloud
she
went
out
down
the
dark
stairs
and
found
the
maid
under
a
swinging
still
scrubbing
how
strange
that
in
that
short
space
of
time
when
the
whole
of
life
had
altered
for
her
that
girl
had
been
on
her
knees
scrubbing
could
you
tell
me
please
she
asked
whether
i
could
see
somebody
who
is
in
charge
of
this
house
the
landlady
or
is
there
anything
i
can
do
said
a
voice
behind
her
she
turned
to
find
a
short
stout
woman
in
voluminous
black
black
bonnet
black
cape
black
gloves
watching
her
with
sharp
bright
eyes
are
you
the
landlady
maggie
asked
i
ham
said
the
woman
mrs
brandon
the
had
suspended
operations
kneeling
up
and
watching
with
open
mouth
developments
i
very
glad
to
meet
you
said
maggie
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
said
brandon
the
point
is
just
this
said
maggie
speaking
rather
fast
as
though
she
were
confused
which
she
was
not
warlock
is
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
and
i
afraid
he
very
ill
indeed
he
very
ill
and
nobody
to
look
after
him
what
i
was
wondering
was
whether
there
was
a
bedroom
in
your
house
that
i
could
have
so
that
i
could
look
after
him
you
see
and
get
him
anything
he
wants
brandon
overlooked
maggie
from
head
to
foot
very
slowly
she
did
it
her
eyes
passing
over
the
rather
shabby
black
hat
the
short
hair
the
plain
black
dress
the
shoes
worn
and
soiled
she
also
looked
at
maggie
well
she
began
trenchard
is
my
name
said
maggie
blushing
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
long
scrutiny
i
you
not
reproaching
anybody
with
neglect
of
the
gentleman
she
had
an
action
as
she
talked
of
flinging
a
very
black
boa
back
across
her
neck
vindictively
wot
i
mean
to
say
is
that
gentleman
lodgers
must
take
their
chance
and
e
two
weeks
overdue
with
rent
as
it
is
but
of
course
i
not
saying
i
could
oblige
a
nice
gentleman
too
although
not
talkative
so
to
speak
but
if
it
would
give
to
a
lady
friend
close
at
as
you
might
say
why
i
would
like
to
be
one
to
stand
in
way
and
let
live
always
been
my
motter
and
a
very
good
one
too
she
said
all
this
very
slowly
with
a
good
many
significant
pauses
maggie
however
felt
nothing
but
happiness
at
the
prospect
of
getting
her
way
she
had
gone
far
beyond
all
personal
sensations
of
shame
or
fear
or
hesitation
would
you
show
me
the
room
please
she
asked
they
pushed
past
the
whose
eyes
followed
them
up
the
stairs
with
hungry
curiosity
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
house
brandon
displayed
a
dark
sulky
little
room
with
damp
of
the
tomb
clinging
to
its
wall
ten
bob
a
week
she
said
she
sunk
her
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
the
best
of
this
is
that
you
can
do
what
you
like
no
one
minds
and
no
one
sees
as
lives
in
glass
that
what
i
say
i
take
it
said
maggie
you
be
wanting
a
key
my
dear
said
brandon
suddenly
very
friendly
to
let
yerself
in
an
out
at
nights
i
fetch
yer
one
she
did
maggie
thanked
her
i
wonder
she
said
whether
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
small
basket
you
could
lend
me
i
going
out
to
buy
one
or
two
necessaries
certingly
said
brandon
all
smiles
certingly
and
anythink
else
you
be
needing
all
you
got
to
do
is
ter
ask
this
settled
maggie
departed
on
her
shopping
expedition
she
was
still
driven
by
a
curious
clarity
and
decision
as
to
what
she
wanted
to
do
she
felt
as
though
she
could
conquer
the
world
and
then
parcel
it
out
equitably
and
with
success
amongst
the
greedy
kings
of
the
earth
what
were
kings
to
her
now
that
she
had
found
martin
less
than
the
dust
lynton
street
offered
her
nothing
but
dirty
and
windows
but
she
found
her
way
into
king
edward
street
and
here
there
were
many
shops
she
had
not
very
much
money
actually
upon
her
and
the
remainder
of
her
precious
three
hundred
was
locked
up
in
a
bank
in
skeaton
but
it
was
a
bank
that
had
she
knew
branches
in
london
she
looked
in
her
purse
and
found
that
she
had
three
pounds
twelve
shillings
and
sixpence
martin
must
have
his
meals
upon
something
other
than
paper
so
the
probability
was
that
there
was
crockery
of
a
kind
in
his
room
or
perhaps
brandon
supplied
it
nevertheless
maggie
first
purchases
were
a
blue
teapot
two
blue
plates
and
two
blue
cups
and
saucers
as
to
food
she
must
get
something
that
could
be
cooked
easily
on
his
fire
she
bought
three
of
the
freshest
possible
eggs
half
a
dozen
sausages
a
loaf
of
bread
half
a
pound
of
butter
two
pots
of
jam
one
pot
of
marmalade
some
apples
a
pound
of
tea
a
pound
of
sugar
this
will
do
as
a
start
she
said
to
herself
she
was
just
about
to
turn
into
lynton
street
when
she
stopped
at
a
flower
shop
in
the
window
smiling
at
her
most
fragrantly
under
the
was
a
white
hyacinth
in
a
blue
pot
it
seemed
to
speak
to
her
with
the
same
significance
as
once
the
ring
with
the
three
pearls
as
though
it
said
you
got
to
use
me
i
a
link
in
the
chain
she
went
in
and
asked
its
price
not
very
much
considering
the
splendour
of
the
blue
pot
she
bought
it
she
was
glad
that
was
not
far
because
now
the
basket
and
the
flower
weighed
heavily
upon
her
she
climbed
the
stairs
to
martin
room
with
beating
heart
suppose
he
had
returned
and
was
there
and
would
not
let
her
in
or
suppose
worse
than
that
that
he
had
returned
packed
his
bag
and
gone
away
again
her
heart
was
beating
so
terribly
when
at
last
she
had
arrived
outside
the
door
that
she
had
to
put
down
the
hyacinth
and
the
basket
and
stand
for
a
minute
there
panting
she
pushed
back
the
door
the
room
was
lit
by
the
reflection
from
a
lamp
in
a
window
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
this
flickered
with
a
pale
uncertain
glow
across
the
floor
he
was
not
here
she
opened
the
bedroom
door
he
had
not
packed
his
bag
she
sighed
with
relief
she
found
a
bell
and
pressed
it
to
her
great
surprise
the
scrubbing
maid
almost
instantly
presented
herself
curiosity
had
undoubtedly
hastened
her
steps
what
your
name
asked
maggie
smiling
emily
said
the
girl
the
first
thing
i
want
is
a
box
of
matches
said
maggie
light
the
gas
for
me
wo
you
the
truth
is
i
not
quite
tall
enough
to
reach
it
emily
lit
the
gas
thank
you
so
much
said
maggie
i
must
have
a
fire
that
the
next
thing
this
cold
room
must
have
been
a
bad
thing
for
warlock
with
his
cough
yes
got
a
corf
said
emily
watching
maggie
with
all
her
eyes
well
do
you
think
i
could
have
a
fire
asked
maggie
emily
considered
i
ask
the
missus
she
said
i
should
wonder
she
returned
soon
with
coal
wood
and
newspaper
she
also
informed
maggie
that
brandon
would
like
to
have
a
little
in
advance
if
convenient
that
being
the
custom
maggie
delivered
up
ten
and
sixpence
and
was
left
with
exactly
two
shillings
in
her
pocket
but
how
beautiful
the
room
appeared
emily
whose
ugly
bony
countenance
now
wore
a
look
of
excited
breathlessness
as
though
she
were
playing
a
new
kind
of
game
discovered
a
piece
of
dark
sad
cloth
somewhere
in
the
lower
region
and
this
was
pinned
up
over
the
window
the
fire
was
soon
blazing
away
as
though
the
fireplace
rejoiced
to
have
a
chance
of
being
warm
once
more
a
shabby
but
clean
was
discovered
and
placed
upon
the
table
and
in
the
middle
of
this
the
hyacinth
was
triumphantly
stationed
now
i
tell
you
what
would
be
nice
said
maggie
also
by
this
time
breathless
and
that
a
lamp
this
gas
is
very
pleasant
is
it
and
it
does
make
such
a
noise
it
does
make
a
noise
said
emily
looking
at
the
gas
as
though
she
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
well
do
you
think
there
a
lamp
somewhere
emily
licked
her
finger
i
ask
the
missus
she
said
and
disappeared
soon
she
returned
with
a
lamp
its
glories
hidden
beneath
a
bright
pink
paper
shade
maggie
removed
the
paper
shade
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
then
the
blue
plates
the
blue
cups
and
saucers
the
blue
teapot
a
shrill
voice
was
heard
calling
for
emily
maggie
had
then
her
kingdom
to
herself
she
stood
there
waiting
and
listening
the
approaching
interview
must
have
seemed
to
her
the
climax
of
her
whole
life
she
stood
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
going
to
the
table
moving
the
plates
then
moving
them
back
again
perhaps
he
would
not
return
at
all
that
night
perhaps
not
until
midnight
or
later
he
might
be
drunk
he
might
be
violent
she
did
not
care
it
was
enough
for
her
that
he
should
be
there
oh
i
do
wish
he
come
she
whispered
aloud
she
had
looked
at
her
watch
and
seen
that
it
was
just
eight
when
she
heard
a
step
on
the
stair
she
had
already
borrowed
from
emily
a
quickly
she
put
the
sausages
into
it
placed
them
on
the
fire
and
then
stood
over
them
the
door
opened
she
knew
who
it
was
because
she
heard
him
start
suddenly
with
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
her
first
thought
was
that
he
seemed
desperately
weary
weary
with
a
fatigue
not
only
physical
his
whole
bearing
was
that
of
a
man
beaten
defeated
raging
it
might
be
with
the
consciousness
of
his
defeat
but
beyond
all
hope
of
avenging
it
her
pity
for
him
made
her
tremble
but
with
that
she
realised
that
the
worst
thing
that
she
could
do
was
to
show
pity
what
had
he
expected
to
find
her
gone
to
find
her
still
sitting
defiantly
where
he
had
left
her
to
see
her
crying
perhaps
on
her
knees
before
him
beseeching
him
anything
but
not
this
she
could
see
that
he
was
astonished
and
was
resolved
not
to
let
her
know
it
he
moved
past
her
without
a
word
and
went
into
the
other
room
she
said
nothing
but
bent
over
the
sausages
they
were
sizzling
and
flung
out
a
splendid
smell
he
came
back
without
his
hat
and
coat
he
stood
by
the
bedroom
door
and
slowly
looked
round
the
room
taking
everything
in
i
thought
you
have
gone
he
said
i
warned
you
she
looked
up
at
him
laughing
i
have
she
said
whatever
happens
afterwards
martin
we
may
as
well
have
one
meal
together
i
very
hungry
i
know
you
forgive
my
using
your
room
like
this
but
i
did
want
to
go
to
a
shop
so
i
just
brought
the
things
in
here
his
eyes
lighted
on
the
hyacinth
i
know
what
your
game
is
he
said
huskily
but
it
is
any
good
you
may
as
well
chuck
it
all
right
she
said
after
we
had
a
meal
straightening
herself
up
from
the
heat
of
the
fire
she
had
a
terrible
temptation
then
to
go
to
him
it
overwhelmed
her
in
a
flood
her
knees
and
hands
trembled
she
wanted
just
to
touch
his
arm
to
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
she
knew
that
she
must
not
sit
down
for
a
bit
she
said
very
quietly
and
let
have
our
meal
there
nothing
terrible
in
that
martin
i
not
put
poison
in
your
food
or
anything
and
the
sausages
do
smell
nice
to
her
surprise
he
sat
down
suddenly
collapsing
as
though
he
were
too
tired
to
stand
any
longer
he
said
nothing
more
she
finished
the
sausages
put
them
on
the
table
then
took
a
saucepan
also
gift
filled
it
with
water
and
put
in
the
eggs
come
on
she
said
gently
or
the
sausages
will
get
cold
he
went
then
to
the
table
cut
off
some
bread
and
began
to
eat
ravenously
her
heart
felt
a
dim
distant
triumph
when
she
saw
that
he
was
so
hungry
but
it
was
too
early
to
feel
triumph
yet
she
came
to
the
table
and
began
to
eat
although
she
felt
no
hunger
you
married
are
you
he
asked
suddenly
yes
she
answered
where
your
husband
a
place
called
skeaton
well
you
better
get
back
there
i
staying
in
london
for
a
day
or
two
where
here
i
got
a
bedroom
upstairs
you
can
do
what
you
damn
well
please
he
said
it
does
matter
to
me
i
going
away
from
here
morning
then
after
another
pause
he
said
what
sort
of
a
man
your
husband
a
clergyman
she
answered
a
clergyman
good
lord
he
laughed
grimly
still
religious
i
see
all
this
time
she
was
thinking
how
ill
he
was
every
breath
that
he
drew
seemed
to
hurt
him
his
eyes
were
dull
and
expressionless
he
moved
his
hands
sometimes
with
a
groping
movement
as
though
he
could
not
see
he
drank
his
tea
thirstily
eagerly
at
last
he
had
finished
he
bent
forward
leaning
on
his
hands
looking
her
steadily
in
the
face
for
the
first
time
it
was
clever
of
you
to
do
this
he
said
damn
clever
i
was
hungry
i
do
mind
confessing
but
that
the
last
of
it
do
you
hear
i
can
look
after
myself
i
know
you
feeling
sorry
for
me
think
in
a
dirty
room
with
no
one
to
look
after
me
think
i
ill
i
bet
amy
told
you
i
was
poor
fellow
you
thought
must
go
and
look
after
him
well
i
not
a
poor
fellow
and
i
do
want
looking
after
i
can
manage
for
myself
very
nicely
and
i
do
want
any
women
hanging
round
i
sick
of
women
and
that
flat
i
not
pretending
it
not
all
my
own
fault
it
is
all
my
own
fault
but
i
do
want
any
one
coming
round
and
saying
so
and
i
do
want
any
pity
you
had
a
nice
romantic
idea
in
your
head
saving
the
sinner
and
all
the
rest
of
it
well
you
can
get
back
to
your
parson
he
the
sort
for
that
kind
of
stuff
indeed
i
have
said
maggie
i
do
care
whether
you
a
sinner
or
not
you
being
too
serious
about
it
all
martin
we
were
old
friends
when
i
heard
you
were
in
london
i
came
to
see
you
that
all
i
may
as
well
stay
here
as
anywhere
else
aunt
anne
dead
and
and
uncle
mathew
too
there
nowhere
else
for
me
to
go
i
pity
you
why
should
i
you
think
too
much
about
yourself
martin
it
was
to
be
clever
that
i
got
these
things
i
was
hungry
and
i
want
to
eat
in
an
shop
oh
i
do
know
he
said
turning
away
from
the
table
he
stood
up
fumbling
in
his
pocket
he
produced
a
pipe
and
some
tobacco
out
of
a
paper
packet
as
he
filled
it
she
saw
that
his
hand
was
trembling
he
turned
finally
upon
her
whatever
your
plan
was
it
failed
he
said
i
going
to
bed
straight
away
now
and
morning
early
i
off
thank
you
for
the
meal
and
and
he
gave
her
one
straight
look
she
looked
up
at
him
calmly
he
dropped
his
eyes
then
clumsily
he
walked
off
opened
his
bedroom
door
closed
it
behind
him
and
was
gone
she
sat
there
staring
in
front
of
her
thinking
what
was
she
to
do
now
at
least
she
might
clear
up
she
had
nowhere
to
wash
the
things
she
would
put
them
ready
for
the
morning
she
tidied
the
table
put
the
plates
and
cups
together
then
overcome
by
a
sudden
exhaustion
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
she
realised
then
the
fight
that
the
day
had
been
yes
a
fight
and
she
was
still
only
at
the
beginning
of
it
if
he
really
went
away
in
the
morning
what
could
she
do
she
could
not
follow
him
all
round
london
but
she
would
not
despair
yet
no
she
was
far
from
despair
but
she
was
tired
tired
to
death
she
sat
on
there
in
a
kind
of
dream
there
were
no
sounds
in
the
house
the
fire
began
to
drop
very
low
there
were
no
more
coals
the
room
began
to
be
very
chilly
she
laid
her
head
back
on
the
sofa
she
was
half
asleep
she
was
dreaming
paul
was
there
and
grace
the
skeaton
sands
the
revival
procession
with
the
lanterns
the
swish
of
the
sea
suddenly
she
was
wide
awake
the
lamp
had
burnt
down
to
a
low
rim
of
light
martin
was
coughing
in
the
other
room
coughing
she
had
never
heard
such
a
cough
something
inhuman
and
strange
she
stood
up
her
hands
clutched
she
waited
then
as
it
continued
growing
fiercer
and
fiercer
so
that
in
spite
of
the
closed
door
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
very
room
with
her
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
room
was
lit
by
a
candle
placed
on
a
chair
beside
the
bed
martin
was
sitting
up
his
hands
clenched
his
face
convulsed
the
cough
went
on
choking
convulsing
as
though
some
terrible
enemy
had
hands
at
his
windpipe
he
grasped
the
bedclothes
his
eyes
frightened
and
dilated
staring
in
front
of
him
she
went
to
him
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
whispered
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
miles
away
bottle
over
there
glass
she
saw
on
the
stand
a
bottle
with
a
medicine
glass
behind
it
she
read
the
directions
poured
out
the
drops
took
it
over
and
gave
it
to
him
he
swallowed
it
down
she
put
out
her
arm
to
steady
him
and
felt
his
whole
body
tremble
beneath
her
hand
gradually
he
was
quieter
utterly
exhausted
he
slipped
back
his
head
on
the
pillow
she
drew
her
chair
close
to
the
bed
he
was
too
exhausted
to
speak
and
did
not
look
at
her
at
all
after
a
while
she
put
her
hand
on
his
forehead
and
stroked
it
he
did
not
draw
away
from
her
slowly
his
head
turned
towards
her
he
lay
there
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
she
bending
forward
over
him
her
heart
beat
she
tried
not
to
be
conscious
of
his
closeness
to
her
but
her
hand
trembled
as
it
touched
his
cheek
still
he
did
not
move
away
after
as
it
seemed
to
her
a
long
time
he
was
asleep
she
listened
to
his
breathing
and
only
then
when
she
knew
that
he
could
not
hear
she
whispered
oh
martin
i
love
you
so
dear
martin
i
love
you
so
much
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
her
arm
beneath
his
head
sat
there
watching
chapter
ii
hobgoblins
the
dawn
had
made
the
dark
room
grey
when
maggie
stiff
and
sore
from
the
strained
position
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
went
up
to
her
room
she
had
intended
not
to
go
to
bed
but
weariness
overcame
her
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
dressed
as
she
was
and
fell
into
a
deep
exhausted
slumber
when
she
woke
it
was
broad
daylight
she
was
how
could
she
have
slept
and
now
he
might
have
gone
she
washed
her
face
and
hands
in
the
horrible
little
tin
basin
brushed
her
hair
and
then
with
beating
heart
went
downstairs
his
was
just
as
she
had
left
it
the
unwashed
plates
piled
together
the
red
cloth
over
the
window
the
dead
ashes
of
the
fire
in
the
grate
very
gently
she
opened
his
bedroom
door
he
was
still
in
bed
she
went
over
to
him
he
was
asleep
muttering
his
hands
clenched
on
the
counterpane
his
cheeks
were
flushed
to
her
inexperienced
eyes
he
looked
very
she
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
with
a
start
he
sprang
awake
his
eyes
wide
open
with
terror
and
he
crying
what
is
it
no
no
do
do
it
all
right
martin
it
i
maggie
she
said
he
stared
at
her
then
dropping
back
on
to
the
pillow
he
muttered
wearily
as
though
he
were
worn
out
after
a
long
struggle
i
bad
it
my
chest
there
a
doctor
they
tell
you
been
here
before
she
went
into
the
other
room
and
rang
the
bell
after
a
time
brandon
herself
appeared
i
afraid
warlock
is
very
ill
said
maggie
trying
to
keep
her
voice
from
trembling
he
asked
me
to
fetch
the
doctor
who
been
here
to
see
him
before
can
you
tell
me
who
he
is
and
where
he
lives
brandon
bright
and
inquisitive
eyes
moved
round
the
room
taking
in
the
blue
china
the
hyacinth
and
the
lamp
certingly
she
said
that
must
be
abrams
lives
in
cowley
street
no
emanuel
abrams
a
good
doctor
when
sober
and
the
morning
the
best
time
to
be
sure
of
certingly
been
in
to
see
your
friend
several
times
they
been
merry
together
more
than
once
where
is
cowley
street
asked
maggie
first
to
the
right
when
you
get
out
of
the
and
then
second
to
the
left
again
no
the
number
it
most
likely
be
asleep
yes
abrams
that
the
name
attended
a
lot
in
this
wot
a
pretty
flower
cheers
the
room
up
i
must
say
will
you
be
wanting
another
fire
yes
said
maggie
could
emily
see
to
that
while
i
away
certingly
said
brandon
looking
at
maggie
with
a
curious
confidential
smile
a
hateful
smile
but
there
was
no
time
to
think
about
it
maggie
went
out
she
found
cowley
street
without
any
difficulty
abrams
was
up
and
having
his
breakfast
his
close
musty
room
smelt
of
whisky
and
kippers
he
himself
was
a
little
fat
round
jew
very
red
in
the
face
very
small
in
the
eye
very
black
in
the
hair
and
very
dirty
in
the
hands
he
was
startled
by
maggie
appearance
very
different
she
was
from
his
usual
patients
looked
just
a
baby
he
informed
brandon
afterwards
mrs
warlock
he
asked
no
said
maggie
defiantly
i
a
friend
of
mr
warlock
ah
yes
quite
so
he
wiped
his
mouth
disappeared
into
another
room
returned
with
a
shabby
black
bag
and
a
still
shabbier
top
hat
and
declared
himself
ready
to
start
it
pneumonia
he
told
her
as
they
went
along
had
it
three
weeks
ago
of
course
if
he
was
out
in
yesterday
fog
that
finished
him
he
was
out
said
maggie
for
a
long
time
quite
so
said
abrams
that
killed
him
i
should
wonder
he
snuffled
in
his
speech
and
he
snuffled
in
his
walk
before
they
had
gone
very
far
he
put
his
hand
on
maggie
arm
she
hated
his
touch
but
his
last
words
had
so
deeply
terrified
her
that
nothing
else
affected
her
if
martin
were
killed
by
going
out
yesterday
then
she
had
killed
him
he
had
gone
out
to
escape
her
but
she
drove
that
thought
from
her
as
she
had
driven
so
many
others
the
pneumonia
bad
enough
said
the
little
man
becoming
more
confidential
as
his
grip
tightened
on
her
arm
but
it
heart
the
trouble
might
finish
him
any
day
tells
me
his
father
was
the
same
what
a
nice
warm
arm
you
got
my
dear
it
a
pleasant
day
too
they
entered
the
house
and
abrams
stayed
chatting
with
emily
in
the
passage
for
a
considerable
time
any
one
of
the
opposite
sex
seemed
to
hare
an
irresistible
attraction
for
him
when
they
went
upstairs
the
doctor
was
so
held
by
his
burning
curiosity
that
it
was
difficult
to
lead
him
into
martin
bedroom
everything
interested
him
he
bent
down
and
felt
the
tablecloth
with
his
dirty
thumb
then
the
soil
round
the
hyacinth
then
the
blue
china
between
every
investigation
he
stared
at
maggie
as
though
he
were
now
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
at
last
however
he
was
bending
over
martin
and
his
examination
was
clever
and
deft
he
had
been
like
his
patient
used
to
better
days
martin
was
very
the
boy
bad
he
said
turning
sharply
round
upon
maggie
from
the
speaking
of
that
word
for
six
days
and
six
nights
he
was
maggie
loyal
friend
and
they
fought
side
by
side
in
the
great
struggle
for
martin
life
they
won
but
when
maggie
tried
to
look
back
afterwards
on
the
history
of
that
wrestling
she
saw
nothing
connectedly
only
the
springing
and
falling
the
little
doctor
sharp
eyes
the
torn
paper
of
the
wall
the
ragged
carpet
and
always
that
strange
mask
that
was
martin
face
and
yet
the
face
of
a
stranger
something
tortured
and
fantastic
passing
from
chinese
immobility
to
frenzied
pain
from
pain
to
sweating
exhaustion
from
exhaustion
back
to
immobility
on
the
eighth
day
she
rose
as
a
swimmer
rises
from
green
depths
and
saw
the
sunshine
and
the
landscape
again
he
do
if
you
careful
said
abrams
and
suddenly
became
once
more
the
curious
dirty
sensual
little
creature
that
he
had
been
at
first
her
only
contact
with
the
outer
world
had
been
her
visits
to
the
neighbouring
streets
for
necessaries
and
one
journey
to
the
bank
the
nearest
branch
was
in
oxford
street
to
settle
about
her
money
but
now
with
the
doctor
words
the
rest
of
the
world
came
back
to
her
she
remembered
paul
she
was
horrified
to
realise
that
during
these
days
she
had
entirely
forgotten
him
he
of
course
could
not
write
to
her
because
he
did
not
know
her
address
when
she
saw
that
martin
was
quietly
sleeping
she
sat
down
and
wrote
the
following
letter
lynton
street
king
cross
april
my
dear
paul
i
have
been
very
wrong
indeed
not
to
write
to
you
before
this
it
only
of
a
piece
with
all
my
other
bad
behaviour
to
you
and
it
very
late
now
to
saw
that
i
am
ashamed
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
which
is
that
on
the
day
i
left
you
i
had
received
a
letter
telling
me
that
the
friend
of
whom
i
have
often
told
you
was
in
england
very
ill
and
with
no
one
to
care
for
him
i
had
to
go
i
do
know
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
wrong
i
suppose
but
i
always
knew
that
if
he
ever
wanted
me
i
should
go
i
always
been
truthful
to
you
about
that
when
i
came
here
i
found
that
he
was
in
horrible
lodgings
very
ill
indeed
and
with
no
one
to
look
after
him
i
had
to
stay
and
now
for
a
week
he
has
been
between
life
and
death
he
had
pneumonia
some
weeks
ago
and
went
out
too
soon
his
heart
also
is
bad
i
believe
now
he
can
get
well
if
great
care
is
taken
dear
paul
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
i
have
a
bedroom
in
this
house
and
every
one
is
very
kind
to
me
but
you
will
think
me
very
wicked
i
ca
help
it
i
ca
come
back
to
you
and
grace
perhaps
later
when
he
is
quite
well
i
shall
be
able
to
but
i
do
think
so
you
do
need
me
i
have
never
been
satisfactory
to
you
only
a
worry
grace
will
never
be
able
to
live
with
me
again
and
i
ca
stay
in
skeaton
any
more
after
uncle
mathew
death
it
has
all
been
a
wretched
mistake
paul
our
marriage
has
it
it
was
my
fault
entirely
i
should
have
married
you
when
i
knew
that
i
would
always
love
martin
i
thought
then
that
i
should
be
able
to
make
you
happy
if
now
i
felt
that
i
could
i
would
come
back
at
once
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
after
this
we
shall
never
be
happy
together
again
i
blame
myself
so
much
but
i
ca
act
differently
perhaps
when
martin
is
well
he
will
not
want
me
at
all
but
even
then
i
do
think
i
could
come
back
is
it
better
that
at
least
i
should
stay
away
for
a
time
you
can
say
that
i
am
staying
with
friends
in
london
you
will
be
happier
without
me
oh
much
happier
and
grace
will
be
happier
too
perhaps
you
will
think
it
better
to
forget
me
altogether
and
then
your
life
will
be
as
it
was
before
you
met
me
i
wo
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
all
the
trouble
i
have
been
to
you
i
do
think
you
can
but
i
ca
do
differently
now
your
affectionate
maggie
she
felt
when
she
had
finished
it
that
it
was
miserably
inadequate
but
at
least
it
was
truthful
as
she
wrote
it
her
old
feelings
of
tenderness
and
affection
for
paul
came
back
in
a
great
flood
she
saw
him
during
the
many
many
times
when
he
had
been
so
good
to
her
she
was
miserable
as
she
finished
it
but
she
knew
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
he
would
know
it
too
a
day
later
a
long
letter
came
from
paul
it
was
very
characteristic
it
began
by
saying
that
of
course
maggie
must
return
at
once
throughout
the
voice
was
that
of
a
grieved
and
angry
elder
talking
to
a
wicked
and
disobedient
child
she
saw
that
far
beyond
everything
else
it
was
his
pride
that
was
wounded
wounded
as
it
had
never
been
before
he
could
see
nothing
but
that
did
she
realise
he
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
sinning
against
all
the
laws
of
god
and
man
if
she
persisted
in
her
wickedness
she
would
be
cut
off
from
all
decent
people
no
one
could
say
that
he
had
not
shown
her
every
indulgence
every
kindness
every
affection
even
now
he
was
ready
to
forgive
her
but
she
must
come
back
at
once
at
once
her
extreme
youth
excused
much
and
both
he
and
grace
realised
it
through
it
all
the
strain
did
she
not
see
what
she
was
doing
how
could
she
behave
so
wickedly
when
she
had
been
given
so
many
blessings
when
she
had
been
shown
the
happiness
of
a
christian
home
it
was
not
a
letter
to
soften
maggie
resolve
she
wrote
a
short
reply
saying
that
she
could
not
come
she
thought
then
that
he
would
run
up
to
london
to
fetch
her
but
he
did
not
he
wrote
once
more
and
then
for
a
time
there
was
silence
she
had
little
interval
in
which
to
think
about
paul
martin
soon
compelled
her
attention
he
was
well
enough
now
to
be
up
he
would
lie
all
day
without
moving
except
to
take
his
meals
on
the
old
red
sofa
stretched
out
there
his
arms
behind
his
head
looking
at
maggie
with
a
strange
taunting
malicious
stare
as
though
he
were
defying
her
to
stand
up
to
him
she
did
stand
up
to
him
although
it
needed
all
her
strength
moral
and
physical
he
was
attacking
her
soul
and
she
was
saving
his
he
said
no
more
about
his
going
away
he
accepted
it
as
a
fact
that
she
was
there
and
that
she
would
stay
there
he
had
changed
his
position
and
was
fighting
her
on
another
ground
maggie
had
once
years
before
read
in
a
magazine
a
story
about
a
traveller
and
a
deserted
house
this
traveller
lost
as
are
all
travellers
in
stories
in
a
forest
benighted
and
hungry
saw
the
lights
of
a
house
he
goes
forward
and
finds
a
magnificent
mansion
blazing
with
light
in
every
window
but
apparently
deserted
he
enters
and
finds
room
after
room
prepared
for
guests
a
fine
meal
is
laid
ready
and
he
enjoys
it
he
discovers
the
softest
of
beds
and
soon
is
fast
asleep
but
when
he
is
safely
snoring
back
creep
all
the
guests
out
of
the
forest
hideous
and
evil
warped
and
deformed
maimed
and
rotten
with
disease
they
had
left
the
house
that
he
might
be
lured
in
it
knowing
that
he
would
never
come
whilst
they
were
there
and
so
they
creep
into
all
the
rooms
flinging
their
horrible
shadows
upon
the
gleaming
walls
and
gradually
they
steal
about
the
bed
maggie
forgot
the
end
of
the
story
the
traveller
escaped
or
perhaps
he
did
not
perhaps
he
was
strangled
but
that
moment
of
his
awakening
when
his
startled
eyes
first
stared
upon
those
horrible
faces
those
deformed
bodies
those
evil
smiles
what
could
one
do
one
naked
and
defenceless
against
so
many
maggie
thought
of
this
story
during
martin
convalescence
she
seemed
to
see
the
evil
guests
crowding
back
one
after
the
other
into
his
soul
and
as
they
came
back
they
peeped
out
at
her
smiling
from
the
lighted
windows
she
saw
that
his
plan
was
to
thrust
before
her
the
very
worst
of
himself
he
said
well
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
her
and
she
wo
go
that
her
own
affair
but
if
she
stays
at
least
she
shall
see
me
as
i
am
no
false
sentimental
picture
i
cure
her
it
was
the
oldest
trick
in
the
world
but
to
maggie
it
was
new
enough
at
first
she
was
terrified
in
spite
of
her
early
experience
with
her
father
when
she
had
learnt
what
wickedness
could
be
she
was
a
child
in
all
knowledge
of
the
world
above
all
she
knew
very
little
about
her
own
sex
and
its
relation
with
men
but
she
determined
that
she
must
take
the
whole
of
martin
in
the
very
first
days
of
her
love
she
had
resolved
that
and
now
that
resolution
was
to
be
put
to
the
test
her
terrified
fear
was
lest
the
things
that
he
told
her
about
himself
should
affect
her
love
for
him
she
had
told
him
years
before
it
is
the
things
you
done
that
i
mind
or
care
about
it
you
not
actions
that
matter
but
his
actions
were
himself
and
what
was
she
to
do
if
all
these
things
that
he
said
were
true
then
she
discovered
that
she
had
indeed
spoken
the
truth
her
love
for
him
did
not
change
it
rather
grew
helped
and
strengthened
by
a
maternal
pity
and
care
that
deepened
and
deepened
he
seemed
to
her
a
man
really
possessed
in
literal
fact
by
devils
the
story
of
the
lighted
house
was
the
symbol
only
he
in
the
bitterness
and
defiance
of
his
heart
had
invited
the
guests
not
been
surprised
by
them
he
pretended
to
glory
in
his
narration
boasting
and
swearing
what
he
would
do
when
he
would
return
to
the
old
scenes
how
happy
and
triumphant
he
had
been
in
the
midst
of
his
filth
but
young
and
ignorant
though
she
was
she
saw
beneath
this
the
misery
the
shame
the
bitterness
the
ignominy
he
was
down
in
the
dust
in
a
despair
furious
and
more
than
anything
of
which
she
had
ever
conceived
again
and
again
too
although
this
was
never
deliberately
stated
she
saw
that
he
spoke
like
a
man
caught
in
a
trap
he
did
not
blame
any
one
but
himself
for
the
catastrophe
of
his
life
but
he
often
spoke
in
spite
of
himself
like
a
man
who
from
the
very
beginning
had
been
under
some
occult
influence
he
never
alluded
now
to
his
early
days
but
she
remembered
how
he
had
once
told
her
that
that
religion
had
got
him
from
the
very
beginning
and
had
weighted
all
the
scales
against
him
it
was
as
though
he
had
said
i
was
told
from
the
very
beginning
that
i
was
to
be
made
a
of
i
did
want
to
be
that
i
was
the
man
for
that
i
was
chosen
wrongly
he
only
once
made
any
allusion
to
his
father
death
but
maggie
very
soon
discovered
that
that
was
never
away
from
his
mind
i
loved
my
father
and
i
killed
him
he
said
one
day
so
i
thought
it
wise
not
to
love
any
one
again
gradually
a
picture
was
created
in
maggie
mind
a
picture
originating
in
that
dirty
dark
room
where
they
were
she
saw
many
foreign
countries
and
many
foreign
towns
and
in
all
of
them
men
and
women
were
evil
the
towns
were
always
in
the
hour
between
daylight
and
dark
the
streets
twisted
and
obscure
the
inhabitants
furtive
and
sinister
the
things
that
those
inhabitants
did
were
made
quite
plain
to
her
she
saw
the
dancing
saloons
the
women
naked
and
laughing
the
men
drunken
and
besotted
the
gambling
the
quarrelling
drugging
suicide
all
under
a
sky
stinking
and
offensive
one
day
at
last
she
laughed
martin
she
cried
do
let
be
so
serious
about
it
you
want
to
go
back
to
that
life
it
so
dull
at
first
i
was
frightened
but
now
why
it
all
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
i
only
telling
you
he
said
i
do
say
that
i
do
want
to
go
back
again
i
do
want
anything
except
for
you
to
go
away
i
just
want
to
go
to
hell
my
own
fashion
you
talk
so
much
about
going
to
hell
she
said
why
for
ten
days
now
you
spoken
of
nothing
else
there
are
other
places
you
know
you
clear
out
and
get
back
to
your
parson
he
said
you
must
see
from
what
i
told
you
it
is
any
good
your
staying
i
no
money
my
health
gone
all
to
billyoh
i
do
want
to
get
better
why
should
i
perhaps
i
did
love
you
a
little
bit
once
in
a
queer
way
but
that
all
gone
now
i
do
love
any
one
on
this
earth
i
just
want
to
get
rid
of
this
almighty
confusion
going
on
in
my
head
i
ca
rest
for
it
i
finish
myself
off
if
i
had
pluck
enough
i
just
have
martin
she
said
why
did
you
write
all
those
letters
to
me
what
letters
he
asked
those
that
amy
stopped
the
ones
from
abroad
oh
i
do
know
he
looked
away
from
her
i
was
a
bit
lonely
i
suppose
tell
me
another
thing
she
said
these
weeks
i
been
here
have
i
bored
you
i
been
too
ill
to
tell
how
do
i
know
well
no
you
have
you
such
a
queer
kid
you
different
from
any
other
human
utterly
different
no
you
have
bored
me
but
do
think
from
that
i
like
having
you
here
i
do
you
remind
me
of
the
old
life
i
do
want
to
think
of
it
more
than
i
must
you
admit
i
been
trying
to
scare
you
stiff
in
all
i
told
you
and
i
have
scared
you
it
true
most
of
it
but
it
is
so
damned
sensational
as
i
tried
to
make
it
but
all
the
same
what
the
use
of
your
staying
i
do
love
you
and
i
never
likely
to
i
told
you
long
ago
you
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
attract
me
physically
you
never
did
you
more
like
a
boy
why
should
you
ruin
your
own
life
when
there
nothing
to
gain
by
it
you
will
ruin
it
you
know
staying
on
here
with
me
every
one
thinks
we
living
together
have
you
heard
from
your
parson
yes
said
maggie
what
does
he
say
he
says
i
got
to
go
back
at
once
well
there
you
are
but
do
you
see
martin
i
should
go
back
to
him
even
if
i
left
you
i
quite
decided
that
he
never
be
happy
with
me
unless
i
love
him
which
i
ca
do
and
there
his
sister
who
hates
me
and
he
just
rooted
in
skeaton
i
ca
live
there
after
uncle
mathew
tell
me
about
that
no
she
said
shrinking
back
i
never
tell
any
one
not
even
you
now
look
here
he
went
on
after
a
pause
you
must
see
how
hopeless
it
is
maggie
you
got
nothing
to
get
out
of
it
as
soon
as
i
well
enough
i
shall
go
off
and
leave
you
you
ca
follow
me
hunting
me
everywhere
you
must
see
that
yes
but
what
you
do
martin
see
she
answered
him
is
that
got
some
right
to
think
of
my
own
happiness
it
quite
true
what
you
say
that
if
you
get
well
and
decide
you
do
want
to
see
me
i
follow
you
of
course
i
wo
perhaps
one
day
you
will
want
me
all
the
same
but
i
happy
only
with
you
and
so
long
as
i
do
bore
you
going
to
stay
i
always
been
wrong
with
every
one
else
stupid
and
doing
everything
i
should
but
with
you
it
is
so
i
not
stupid
and
however
you
behave
i
happy
i
ca
help
it
it
just
so
but
how
can
you
be
happy
he
said
i
not
the
sort
for
any
one
to
be
happy
with
when
i
been
drinking
i
impossible
i
sulky
and
lazy
and
i
do
want
to
be
any
better
either
you
may
think
happy
these
first
few
weeks
but
you
wo
be
later
on
let
try
said
maggie
laughing
here
a
bargain
martin
you
say
i
do
bore
you
i
stay
with
you
until
you
quite
well
then
if
you
do
want
me
i
go
and
not
bother
you
until
you
ask
for
me
is
that
a
bargain
you
much
better
not
he
said
oh
do
think
i
staying
she
answered
because
i
think
you
so
splendid
that
i
ca
leave
you
i
do
think
you
splendid
at
all
and
it
not
because
i
think
myself
splendid
either
i
being
quite
selfish
about
it
i
staying
simply
because
i
happier
so
you
much
better
not
he
repeated
is
that
a
bargain
yes
if
you
like
he
answered
looking
at
her
with
puzzled
eyes
it
was
the
first
long
conversation
that
they
had
had
after
it
he
was
no
nicer
than
before
he
never
kissed
her
he
never
touched
her
he
seldom
talked
to
her
when
she
talked
he
seemed
to
be
little
interested
for
hours
he
lay
there
looking
in
front
of
him
saying
nothing
when
the
little
doctor
came
they
wrangled
and
fought
together
but
seemed
to
like
one
another
through
it
all
maggie
could
see
that
he
was
riddled
with
deep
shame
and
and
haunted
always
by
the
thought
of
his
father
she
longed
to
speak
to
him
about
his
father
death
but
as
yet
she
did
not
dare
if
once
she
could
persuade
him
that
that
had
not
been
his
fault
she
could
she
thought
really
help
him
that
was
the
secret
canker
at
his
heart
and
she
could
not
touch
it
strangely
as
the
days
passed
the
years
that
had
been
added
to
him
since
their
last
meeting
seemed
to
fall
away
he
became
to
her
more
and
more
the
boy
that
he
had
been
when
she
had
known
him
before
in
a
thousand
ways
he
showed
it
his
extraordinary
youth
and
inexperience
in
spite
of
all
that
he
had
been
and
done
she
felt
older
now
than
he
and
she
loved
him
the
more
for
that
most
of
all
she
longed
to
get
him
away
from
this
place
where
he
was
then
one
day
little
abrams
said
to
her
he
never
get
well
here
that
what
i
think
she
said
ca
you
carry
him
off
somewhere
the
country
the
place
for
him
somewhere
in
the
south
her
heart
leapt
oh
glebeshire
she
cried
well
that
not
a
bad
place
he
said
that
would
pick
him
up
at
once
she
thought
night
and
day
of
dreot
a
very
hunger
possessed
her
to
get
back
there
and
why
not
for
one
thing
it
would
be
so
much
cheaper
her
money
would
not
last
for
ever
and
brandon
robbed
her
whenever
possible
she
determined
that
she
would
manage
it
at
last
greatly
fearing
it
she
mentioned
it
to
him
and
to
her
surprise
he
did
not
scorn
it
i
do
care
he
said
looking
at
her
with
that
curious
puzzled
expression
that
she
often
saw
now
in
his
eyes
i
sick
of
this
room
that
a
bargain
maggie
you
can
put
me
where
you
like
until
i
well
then
i
off
she
had
a
strange
superstition
that
borhedden
was
fated
to
see
her
triumph
she
had
wandered
round
the
world
and
now
was
returning
again
to
her
own
home
she
remembered
a
bolitho
who
had
had
the
farm
in
her
day
she
wrote
to
her
and
two
days
later
received
a
letter
saying
that
there
was
room
for
them
at
borhedden
if
they
wished
she
was
now
all
feverish
impatience
abrams
said
that
martin
could
be
moved
if
they
were
very
careful
all
plans
were
made
brandon
and
the
ugly
little
doctor
both
seemed
quite
sorry
that
they
were
going
and
emily
even
sniffed
and
wiped
her
eye
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
the
world
seemed
now
to
be
turning
a
different
face
to
maggie
human
beings
liked
her
and
were
no
longer
suspicious
to
her
as
they
had
been
before
she
felt
herself
how
greatly
she
had
changed
it
was
as
though
until
she
had
found
martin
again
everything
had
been
tied
up
in
her
constrained
she
had
been
some
one
lost
and
desolate
nevertheless
how
difficult
these
days
were
through
all
this
time
she
spoke
to
him
no
affectionate
word
nor
touched
him
with
an
affectionate
gesture
she
was
simply
a
companion
laughing
at
him
assuming
through
it
all
an
indifference
that
meant
for
her
so
difficult
a
pretence
that
she
thought
he
must
discover
it
he
did
not
he
was
in
many
ways
more
simple
than
she
she
laid
to
sleep
his
suspicions
she
could
feel
his
relief
that
she
was
not
romantic
that
she
wanted
nothing
whatever
from
him
he
was
ill
therefore
was
often
churlish
he
tried
to
hurt
her
again
and
again
with
cruel
words
and
then
waited
to
see
whether
she
were
hurt
she
never
showed
him
he
treated
her
with
contempt
often
not
answering
her
questions
laughing
at
her
little
stupidities
complaining
of
her
forgetfulness
and
sometimes
her
untidiness
telling
her
again
and
again
to
go
back
to
her
parson
she
gave
no
sign
she
fought
her
way
but
it
hurt
she
could
not
have
believed
that
anything
could
hurt
so
much
she
was
being
always
drawn
to
him
longing
to
put
her
arm
around
him
to
dare
to
kiss
him
risking
any
repulse
he
seemed
so
young
so
helpless
so
unhappy
every
part
of
him
called
to
her
his
hair
his
eyes
his
voice
his
body
but
she
held
herself
in
she
never
gave
way
she
was
resolute
in
her
plan
on
their
last
evening
in
lynton
street
for
five
minutes
he
was
suddenly
kind
to
her
almost
the
old
martin
speaking
with
the
old
voice
she
held
her
breath
scarcely
daring
to
let
herself
know
how
happy
she
was
what
do
you
think
about
god
maggie
he
asked
turning
on
the
sofa
and
looking
at
her
think
about
god
she
said
repeating
his
words
yes
is
there
one
i
do
know
i
have
any
intelligence
about
those
things
is
there
immortality
i
do
know
i
hope
not
your
parson
thinks
there
is
does
he
of
course
he
does
did
he
have
lots
of
services
and
did
you
hare
to
go
to
them
yes
poor
maggie
always
having
to
go
to
them
well
it
queer
funny
if
there
is
anything
after
all
when
there
been
such
a
fight
about
it
so
long
did
they
make
you
very
religious
at
skeaton
or
wherever
the
place
was
no
said
maggie
they
thought
me
a
terrible
heathen
grace
was
terrified
of
me
i
seemed
so
wicked
to
her
she
thought
i
was
bewitching
paul
soul
perhaps
you
were
no
so
little
did
i
that
he
has
even
come
up
to
london
to
fetch
me
which
did
you
like
best
skeaton
or
the
chapel
i
do
know
i
was
wrong
in
both
of
them
they
were
just
opposite
maggie
waited
a
little
then
she
said
martin
there
must
be
something
i
can
feel
it
as
though
it
were
behind
a
wall
somewhere
i
can
hear
it
and
i
ca
see
anything
aunt
anne
and
and
your
father
and
paul
and
magnus
were
all
trying
it
feels
like
a
fight
but
i
know
who
fighting
who
her
allusion
to
his
father
had
been
unfortunate
it
all
damned
rot
if
you
ask
me
he
said
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
would
say
another
word
next
morning
they
started
brandon
bill
was
as
large
as
she
could
make
it
and
still
not
very
large
abrams
to
maggie
immense
surprise
would
not
take
a
penny
i
not
wantin
money
just
now
he
said
i
robbing
a
rich
old
man
who
lives
near
here
i
a
sort
of
highway
man
you
know
rob
the
rich
and
spend
it
how
i
like
now
do
you
press
me
to
make
up
a
bill
or
i
shall
change
my
mind
and
give
you
one
and
it
will
be
so
large
that
you
wo
be
able
to
go
down
to
glebeshire
how
would
you
like
that
oh
do
think
i
doing
it
from
fine
motives
you
both
a
couple
of
babies
that
what
you
are
and
it
would
be
a
shame
to
rob
you
how
you
ever
going
to
get
through
the
world
do
know
the
babes
in
the
wood
were
in
it
he
thinks
he
wicked
does
he
yes
he
does
said
maggie
wicked
why
he
does
know
what
wickedness
is
a
couple
of
children
look
after
his
heart
or
he
be
popping
off
one
fine
morning
maggie
turned
pale
oh
no
she
said
her
voice
trembling
he
going
to
get
well
abrams
sniffed
if
he
does
drink
and
leads
a
healthy
life
he
may
but
leopards
do
change
their
spots
he
worrying
over
something
what
is
it
his
father
death
said
maggie
he
loved
his
father
more
than
any
one
and
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
he
gave
him
a
shock
and
killed
him
well
you
get
it
out
of
his
head
said
abrams
he
wo
be
better
until
you
do
next
morning
they
were
at
paddington
martin
very
feeble
but
indifferent
to
everything
they
had
a
compartment
to
themselves
until
they
got
to
exeter
and
all
that
while
martin
never
spoke
a
word
during
this
time
maggie
did
a
lot
of
quiet
thinking
she
was
worried
of
course
about
many
things
but
especially
finances
she
knew
very
little
about
money
she
gathered
from
martin
that
he
had
not
only
spent
ail
that
his
and
had
left
him
but
had
gone
considerably
beyond
it
that
he
was
badly
in
debt
and
saw
no
way
of
paying
this
did
not
seem
to
worry
him
but
it
worried
maggie
debts
seemed
to
her
awful
things
and
she
could
not
imagine
how
any
one
lived
under
the
burden
of
them
supposing
martin
were
ill
for
a
long
time
how
would
they
two
live
her
little
stock
of
money
would
not
last
very
long
she
must
get
work
but
she
knew
more
about
the
world
after
her
years
at
skeaton
she
knew
how
ignorant
she
was
how
uneducated
and
how
unsophisticated
she
did
not
doubt
her
ability
to
fight
her
way
but
there
might
be
weary
months
first
and
meanwhile
what
of
martin
she
looked
at
him
asleep
now
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
his
soft
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
his
head
sunk
his
hands
heavy
and
idle
on
his
lap
a
fear
caught
at
her
heart
as
she
watched
him
he
looked
indeed
terribly
ill
exhausted
with
struggle
and
now
with
all
the
bitterness
and
despair
drowned
in
sleep
very
gentle
and
helpless
she
bent
over
and
folded
the
rug
more
closely
round
his
knees
had
he
woken
then
and
seen
her
gaze
her
hand
routed
for
an
instant
on
his
then
she
withdrew
back
into
her
own
corner
that
coming
back
into
glebeshire
could
not
but
be
wonderful
to
her
she
had
been
away
for
so
long
and
it
was
her
home
the
tranquillity
and
peace
of
the
spring
evening
clothed
her
like
a
garment
the
brown
valleys
the
soft
green
of
the
fields
the
mild
blue
of
the
sky
touched
her
until
she
could
with
difficulty
keep
back
her
tears
oh
make
it
right
she
whispered
make
it
right
give
him
to
me
again
i
do
love
him
so
it
was
dusk
when
they
arrived
at
clinton
mary
the
little
station
stood
open
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
blowing
in
from
the
wide
expanses
of
mary
moor
maggie
remembered
as
though
it
were
yesterday
her
arrival
at
that
station
with
aunt
anne
yes
she
had
grown
since
then
a
trap
was
waiting
for
them
martin
was
still
very
silent
but
he
liked
the
air
with
the
tang
of
the
sea
in
it
and
he
asked
sometimes
about
the
names
of
places
as
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
all
the
old
remembered
scenes
maggie
heart
beat
faster
and
faster
this
lane
that
field
that
cottage
and
then
at
last
there
was
the
vicarage
perched
on
the
top
of
the
hill
with
its
chimneys
like
ears
she
thought
of
uncle
mathew
the
sight
of
the
tranquil
evening
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
the
fields
enabled
her
to
think
of
him
for
the
first
time
quietly
she
could
face
deliberately
his
death
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
here
and
had
come
forward
to
reassure
her
they
drove
through
the
quiet
little
village
out
on
to
the
high
road
then
down
a
side
lane
the
hedges
brushing
against
the
sides
of
the
jingle
then
through
the
gates
into
the
yard
with
borhedden
farm
bright
with
its
lighted
windows
waiting
for
them
bolitho
was
standing
in
the
porch
and
greeted
them
warmly
you
be
just
starved
she
said
it
wisht
work
driving
in
an
open
jingle
all
the
way
from
clinton
supper
just
about
ready
they
were
shown
up
to
the
big
roomy
bedroom
smelling
of
candles
and
clover
and
lavender
martin
stood
there
looking
about
then
oh
martin
is
it
nice
maggie
cried
i
do
hope
you
be
happy
here
the
emotion
of
returning
home
of
seeing
the
old
places
sniffing
the
old
scents
reviving
the
old
memories
was
too
much
for
her
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
for
a
moment
for
a
wonderful
moment
it
seemed
that
he
was
going
to
respond
she
felt
him
move
towards
her
his
hands
tightened
about
hers
then
but
very
gently
he
drew
away
from
her
and
walked
to
the
window
chapter
iii
the
triumph
of
life
maggie
before
she
left
london
had
written
both
to
paul
and
magnus
giving
them
her
new
address
she
had
intended
to
see
magnus
but
martin
illness
had
absorbed
her
so
deeply
that
she
could
not
proceed
outside
it
she
told
him
quite
frankly
that
she
was
going
down
to
glebeshire
with
martin
and
that
she
would
remain
with
him
there
until
he
was
well
she
did
not
try
to
defend
herself
she
did
not
argue
the
case
at
all
she
simply
stated
the
facts
magnus
wrote
to
her
at
once
he
was
deeply
concerned
he
did
not
chide
her
for
what
she
had
done
but
he
begged
her
to
realise
her
position
she
felt
through
every
line
of
his
letter
that
he
disapproved
of
and
distrusted
martin
his
love
for
maggie
and
she
felt
that
he
had
indeed
love
for
her
made
him
look
on
martin
as
the
instigator
in
this
affair
he
saw
maggie
ignorant
of
the
world
led
away
by
a
seducer
from
her
married
life
persuaded
to
embark
upon
what
his
own
experience
had
taught
him
to
be
a
dangerous
lonely
and
often
disastrous
voyage
he
had
never
heard
of
any
good
of
martin
he
had
been
always
in
his
view
idle
dissolute
and
selfish
what
could
he
think
but
that
martin
had
most
wickedly
persuaded
her
to
abandon
her
safety
she
answered
his
letter
telling
him
in
the
greatest
detail
the
truth
she
told
him
that
martin
had
done
all
he
could
to
refuse
that
had
he
not
been
so
ill
he
would
have
left
her
that
he
had
threatened
her
again
and
again
with
what
he
would
do
if
she
did
not
the
him
she
showed
him
that
it
had
been
her
own
determination
and
absolute
resolve
that
had
created
the
situation
and
she
told
him
that
she
was
happy
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
but
his
letter
did
force
her
to
realise
the
difficulties
of
her
position
in
writing
to
bolitho
she
had
spoken
of
herself
as
martin
wife
and
now
when
she
was
called
warlock
she
tacitly
accepted
that
hating
the
deceit
but
wishing
for
anything
that
might
keep
the
situation
tranquil
and
undisturbed
she
asked
bolitho
to
let
her
have
a
small
room
near
the
big
one
telling
her
that
martin
was
so
ill
that
he
must
be
undisturbed
at
night
then
magnus
letter
arrived
addressed
to
miss
cardinal
and
she
thought
that
bolitho
looked
at
her
oddly
when
she
gave
it
to
her
martin
illness
too
seemed
to
disturb
the
household
he
cried
out
in
his
dreams
his
shouts
waking
the
whole
establishment
bolitho
once
thinking
that
murder
was
being
committed
went
to
his
room
found
him
sitting
up
in
bed
sweating
with
terror
he
caught
hold
of
bolitho
flung
his
arms
around
him
would
not
let
him
go
urging
him
not
to
help
them
to
protect
him
they
would
catch
him
they
would
catch
him
they
would
catch
him
the
stout
and
phlegmatic
farmer
was
himself
frightened
sitting
there
on
the
bed
in
his
and
seeing
ghosts
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
candle
martin
conduct
during
the
day
was
not
reassuring
he
had
lost
all
his
ferocity
and
bitterness
he
was
very
quiet
speaking
to
no
one
lying
on
a
sofa
that
the
moor
watching
bolitho
really
soft
heart
was
touched
by
his
pallor
and
weakness
but
she
could
not
deny
that
there
was
something
queer
here
maggie
almost
wished
that
his
old
mood
of
truculence
would
return
she
was
terrified
too
of
these
night
scenes
because
they
were
so
bad
for
his
heart
the
local
doctor
a
clever
young
fellow
called
stephens
told
her
that
he
was
recovering
from
the
pneumonia
but
that
his
heart
was
dickey
must
let
anything
excite
him
warlock
he
said
there
came
then
gradually
over
the
old
house
and
the
village
the
belief
that
martin
was
fey
bolitho
was
in
most
ways
a
sensible
practical
woman
but
like
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
glebeshire
she
was
deeply
superstitious
it
was
not
so
very
many
years
since
old
jane
curtis
had
been
ducked
in
the
dreot
pond
for
a
witch
and
even
now
did
a
cow
fall
sick
or
the
lambs
die
the
involuntary
thought
in
the
glebeshire
pagan
mind
was
to
look
for
the
evil
eye
but
bolitho
herself
had
had
a
very
recent
example
in
her
own
family
of
possession
there
had
been
her
old
grandfather
living
in
the
farm
with
them
as
hale
and
hearty
a
human
of
years
as
you
be
likely
to
find
in
a
day
march
through
glebeshire
he
lost
touch
with
them
as
bolitho
put
it
in
a
night
his
colour
failed
him
his
cheerful
conversation
left
him
he
could
do
nought
but
sit
and
stare
out
o
window
a
month
later
he
died
martin
had
not
been
long
at
borhedden
before
she
came
to
her
conclusions
about
him
told
them
to
her
james
and
found
that
his
slow
but
sure
brains
had
come
to
the
same
decision
in
the
sense
of
the
tragedy
overhanging
the
poor
young
man
she
forgot
to
consider
the
possible
impropriety
of
his
relations
with
maggie
he
was
removed
at
once
from
human
laws
and
human
judgment
he
became
a
creature
of
god
and
was
surrounded
with
something
of
the
care
and
reverence
with
which
the
principal
softie
in
the
village
was
regarded
it
was
not
that
martin
behaviour
was
in
any
way
odd
after
a
few
days
in
the
utter
peace
and
quiet
of
the
moor
and
farm
he
screamed
no
more
at
night
he
was
gentle
and
polite
to
every
one
ate
his
meals
took
little
walks
out
on
to
the
moor
and
into
the
village
but
liked
best
to
sit
in
front
of
the
parlour
window
and
look
out
on
to
the
heath
and
grass
watching
the
shadows
and
the
sunlight
and
the
driving
sheets
of
rain
bolitho
had
a
tender
heart
and
maggie
shared
in
her
superstitious
pity
looking
back
to
her
youth
she
had
always
thought
maggie
a
wisht
little
thing
poor
worm
what
chance
had
she
ever
had
with
that
great
scandalous
chap
of
a
father
she
saw
her
still
in
her
shabby
clothes
trying
to
keep
that
dilapidated
house
together
no
what
chance
had
she
ever
had
she
was
still
a
wisht
little
thing
nor
did
it
need
very
shrewd
eyes
to
see
how
desperately
devoted
maggie
was
to
martin
the
sight
of
that
touched
the
hearts
of
every
human
being
in
the
farm
not
that
maggie
was
foolish
she
did
not
hang
about
martin
all
the
time
she
never
so
far
as
bolitho
could
see
kissed
him
or
fondled
him
or
was
with
him
when
he
did
not
want
her
she
was
not
sentimental
to
him
not
sighing
nor
groaning
nor
pestering
him
to
answer
romantic
questions
on
the
contrary
she
was
always
cheerful
practical
and
full
of
common
sense
although
she
was
sometimes
forgetful
and
was
not
so
neat
and
tidy
as
bolitho
would
have
wished
she
always
spoke
as
though
martin
recovery
were
quite
certain
and
stephens
told
bolitho
that
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
the
truth
to
her
the
chances
against
his
recovery
stephens
said
are
about
one
in
a
hundred
he
been
racketing
about
too
long
too
much
drink
but
he
got
something
on
his
mind
that
really
what
the
matter
with
him
bolitho
was
as
naturally
inquisitive
as
are
most
of
her
sex
and
this
knowledge
that
martin
was
a
doomed
creature
with
a
guilty
conscience
vastly
excited
her
curiosity
what
had
the
man
done
what
had
been
his
relations
with
maggie
above
all
did
he
really
care
for
maggie
or
no
that
was
finally
the
question
that
was
most
eagerly
discussed
in
the
depths
of
the
bolitho
bedchamber
james
bolitho
maintained
that
he
did
care
that
for
her
you
could
see
plain
enough
he
asserted
when
a
man
cared
for
a
maid
there
were
signs
sure
and
certain
just
as
there
were
with
cows
and
horses
you
may
know
about
cows
and
horses
said
bolitho
you
wrong
about
humans
the
way
that
she
put
it
was
that
martin
cared
for
maggie
but
could
get
it
out
he
does
want
her
to
know
it
she
said
why
should
he
asked
james
now
you
asking
said
bolitho
nice
kind
of
courtin
that
be
said
james
good
thing
you
was
a
bit
different
missus
lovin
a
lass
and
not
speaking
should
like
bolitho
heart
grew
very
tender
towards
maggie
married
or
not
the
child
was
in
a
fiery
passion
of
love
nor
was
it
a
selfish
passion
neither
wanted
very
little
for
herself
but
only
for
him
to
get
well
there
was
true
romance
here
maggie
however
gave
away
no
secrets
she
had
many
talks
with
bolitho
about
the
village
about
the
new
parson
about
bolitho
son
jacob
now
in
london
engineering
and
the
apple
of
her
eye
about
many
things
but
never
about
herself
the
past
history
nor
her
feeling
for
martin
the
girl
never
let
on
that
she
was
suffering
and
yet
suffering
she
must
be
you
could
see
that
she
was
just
holding
herself
tight
like
a
wire
the
strange
intensity
of
her
determination
was
beautiful
but
also
dangerous
if
anything
was
to
happen
said
bolitho
she
saw
martin
too
many
times
looking
at
maggie
in
the
strangest
way
as
though
he
were
travelling
towards
some
decision
he
certainly
was
a
good
young
man
in
his
behaviour
doing
now
exactly
what
he
was
told
never
angry
never
complaining
and
that
bolitho
thought
was
strange
because
you
could
see
in
his
eye
that
he
had
a
will
and
a
temper
of
his
own
did
he
like
to
exercise
them
after
all
he
himself
was
the
merest
boy
scarcely
older
than
jacob
she
could
herself
see
that
he
must
have
been
a
fine
enough
lad
when
he
had
his
health
the
breadth
of
his
shoulders
the
thick
sturdiness
of
his
shape
the
strength
of
his
thighs
and
arms
her
husband
had
seen
the
boy
stripped
and
had
told
her
that
he
must
have
been
a
lovely
man
drink
and
evil
women
ay
they
brought
him
down
as
they
brought
many
another
and
she
thought
of
her
jacob
in
london
with
a
catch
at
her
heart
she
stopped
in
her
cooking
and
prayed
there
and
then
upon
her
kitchen
floor
that
he
might
be
kept
safe
from
all
harm
nearly
every
one
in
the
village
of
course
remembered
maggie
and
they
could
not
see
that
she
was
any
changed
cut
short
london
fashion
they
supposed
they
had
liked
her
as
a
child
and
they
liked
her
now
she
was
more
cheerful
and
friendly
they
thought
then
she
used
to
be
nevertheless
all
the
village
awaited
with
deep
interest
for
what
they
felt
would
be
a
very
moving
climax
the
young
man
was
fey
god
had
set
his
mark
upon
him
and
nothing
that
any
human
being
could
do
would
save
him
in
old
days
they
would
have
tried
to
come
near
him
and
touch
him
to
snatch
some
virtue
from
the
contact
they
did
not
do
that
but
they
felt
when
they
had
spoken
to
him
that
they
had
received
some
merit
or
advantage
the
new
parson
came
to
call
upon
martin
and
maggie
but
he
got
very
little
from
his
visit
poor
fellow
he
said
to
his
wife
on
his
return
his
days
are
numbered
i
fear
to
every
one
it
was
as
though
martin
and
maggie
were
enclosed
in
some
world
of
their
own
no
one
could
come
near
them
no
one
could
tell
of
what
they
were
really
thinking
of
their
hopes
or
fears
past
or
future
only
as
bolitho
said
to
her
husband
one
thing
certain
she
do
love
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
poor
lamb
when
martin
and
maggie
had
been
at
the
farm
about
a
there
came
to
dreot
a
travelling
circus
this
was
a
very
small
affair
but
it
came
every
year
and
provided
considerable
excitement
for
the
village
population
there
were
also
gipsies
who
came
on
the
moor
and
telling
the
fortunes
of
any
who
had
a
spare
sixpence
with
which
to
cross
their
palms
the
foreign
and
exotic
colour
that
the
circus
and
the
gipsies
brought
into
the
village
was
exactly
suited
to
the
dreot
blood
many
centuries
ago
strange
galleys
had
forced
their
way
into
bays
and
creeks
of
the
southern
coast
and
soon
dark
strangers
had
penetrated
across
the
moors
and
fields
and
had
mingled
with
the
natives
of
the
plain
scarcely
an
inhabitant
of
dreot
but
had
some
dark
colour
in
his
blood
a
gift
from
those
phoenician
adventurers
scarcely
an
inhabitant
but
was
conscious
from
time
to
time
of
other
strains
more
tumultuous
passions
than
the
saxon
race
could
show
this
coming
of
the
circus
had
in
it
whether
they
knew
it
or
no
something
of
the
welcoming
of
their
own
people
back
to
them
again
they
liked
to
see
the
elephant
and
the
camel
tread
solemnly
the
uneven
stones
of
the
village
street
they
liked
to
hear
the
roar
of
the
wild
beasts
at
night
when
they
were
safe
and
warm
in
their
own
comfortable
beds
they
liked
to
have
solemn
consultations
with
the
gipsy
girls
as
to
their
mysterious
destinies
the
animals
indeed
were
not
many
nor
poor
things
were
they
after
many
years
chains
and
discipline
very
fierce
nevertheless
they
roared
because
they
knew
it
was
their
duty
so
to
do
and
when
the
lion
turn
came
a
notice
was
hung
up
outside
his
cage
saying
this
is
the
lion
that
last
year
at
clinton
bit
miss
harper
there
were
also
performing
dogs
a
bear
and
two
seals
the
circus
was
quite
close
to
the
farm
i
do
hope
said
bolitho
to
martin
that
the
roaring
of
the
animals
wo
disturb
you
it
did
not
disturb
him
he
seemed
to
like
it
and
went
out
and
stood
there
watching
all
the
labours
of
the
gipsies
and
the
tent
men
and
even
went
into
the
green
boar
and
drank
a
glass
of
beer
with
marquis
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
on
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
there
was
a
proper
glebeshire
mist
it
was
a
day
also
of
freezing
biting
cold
such
a
day
as
sometimes
comes
in
of
a
glebeshire
may
cold
that
seems
in
its
damp
penetration
more
piercing
than
any
frost
the
mist
came
rolling
up
over
the
moor
in
wreaths
and
spirals
of
shadowy
grey
sometimes
shot
with
a
queer
dull
light
as
though
the
sun
was
fighting
behind
it
to
beat
a
way
through
sometimes
so
dense
and
thick
that
standing
at
the
door
of
the
farm
you
could
not
see
your
hand
in
front
of
your
face
it
was
cold
with
the
chill
of
the
sea
foam
mysterious
in
its
intricacies
of
shape
and
form
lifting
for
a
sudden
instant
and
showing
green
grass
and
the
pale
spring
flowers
in
the
border
by
the
windows
then
charging
down
again
with
fold
on
fold
of
vapour
thicker
and
thicker
swaying
and
throbbing
with
a
purpose
and
meaning
of
its
own
early
in
the
afternoon
bolitho
took
a
peep
at
her
lodgers
she
did
not
intend
to
spy
she
was
an
honest
woman
but
she
shared
most
vividly
the
curiosity
of
all
the
village
about
these
two
queer
ignorant
children
as
she
called
them
standing
in
the
of
her
own
little
parlour
she
could
see
the
and
part
of
the
room
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
maggie
and
martin
stood
there
looking
out
into
the
mist
the
woman
could
see
maggie
face
dim
though
the
light
was
and
a
certain
haunting
desire
in
it
tugged
at
bolitho
tender
heart
poor
worm
she
thought
to
herself
she
longing
for
him
to
say
something
to
her
and
he
wo
they
were
talking
then
there
was
a
pause
and
martin
turned
away
maggie
eyes
passionately
besought
him
what
did
she
want
him
to
do
to
say
bolitho
could
see
that
the
hands
were
clenched
as
though
she
had
reached
at
last
the
very
limits
of
her
endurance
he
did
not
see
his
back
was
half
turned
to
her
he
did
not
speak
but
stood
there
drumming
with
his
hands
on
the
glass
oh
i
could
shake
him
thought
bolitho
impatience
for
a
time
maggie
waited
never
stirring
her
eyes
fixed
her
body
taut
then
she
seemed
suddenly
to
break
as
though
the
moment
of
endurance
was
past
she
turned
sharply
round
looking
directly
out
of
her
window
into
bolitho
room
but
she
did
see
bolitho
that
good
woman
saw
her
smile
a
strange
little
smile
of
defiance
pathos
loneliness
cheeriness
defeated
she
vanished
from
her
window
although
he
stood
there
a
moment
later
in
a
coat
and
hat
she
came
out
of
the
front
door
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
outskirts
of
the
mist
looking
about
her
then
vanished
on
to
the
moor
she
ought
to
be
out
in
this
thought
the
farmer
wife
dangerous
she
waited
a
little
then
came
and
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
other
she
met
martin
in
the
doorway
oh
bolitho
he
said
i
thought
i
go
to
the
circus
for
half
an
hour
very
well
sir
she
said
he
too
disappeared
she
sat
in
her
kitchen
all
the
afternoon
busily
mending
the
undergarments
of
her
beloved
james
but
her
thought
were
not
with
her
husband
she
could
not
get
the
picture
of
those
two
young
things
standing
at
the
window
facing
the
moor
out
of
her
head
the
sense
that
had
come
to
the
farm
with
martin
entry
into
it
of
something
eerie
and
foreboding
increased
now
with
every
tick
of
the
heavy
kitchen
clock
she
seemed
to
listen
now
for
sounds
and
portents
the
on
the
wall
was
that
foolish
some
men
said
so
but
she
knew
better
had
she
not
heard
it
on
the
very
night
of
her
grandfather
death
she
sat
there
and
recounted
to
herself
every
that
in
the
course
of
a
long
life
had
come
her
way
the
headless
horseman
the
coach
with
the
dead
travellers
the
three
pirates
and
their
swaying
gibbets
the
ghost
of
dreot
churchyard
the
wailing
woman
of
clinton
and
many
many
others
all
passed
before
her
making
pale
her
cheek
and
sending
her
heart
in
violent
beats
up
and
down
the
scale
the
kitchen
grew
darker
and
darker
she
let
the
underclothes
lie
upon
her
lap
soon
she
must
light
the
lamp
but
meanwhile
before
the
oven
she
let
her
fancies
overwhelm
her
luxuriating
in
her
terror
suddenly
the
was
flung
open
she
started
up
with
a
cry
martin
stood
there
and
in
a
voice
so
new
to
her
that
she
seemed
never
to
have
heard
it
before
he
shouted
where
maggie
she
stood
up
in
great
agitation
he
came
towards
her
and
she
saw
that
his
face
was
violent
with
agitation
with
a
kind
of
rage
where
maggie
he
repeated
she
saw
that
he
was
shaking
all
over
and
it
was
as
though
he
did
not
know
who
she
was
maggie
she
repeated
my
wife
my
wife
he
cried
and
he
shouted
it
again
as
though
he
were
proclaiming
some
fact
to
the
whole
world
she
went
out
said
bolitho
about
three
hours
back
i
should
think
went
out
he
stormed
at
her
and
in
this
then
before
she
could
say
another
word
he
was
gone
it
was
in
very
truth
like
an
apparition
she
sat
there
for
some
time
staring
in
front
of
her
still
shaken
by
the
violence
of
his
interruption
she
went
then
to
the
and
listened
not
a
sound
in
the
house
she
went
farther
out
through
the
passage
to
the
she
opened
it
and
looked
out
a
sea
of
driving
mist
billowing
and
driving
as
though
by
some
internal
breeze
met
her
poor
things
she
said
to
herself
they
should
be
out
in
this
she
shut
the
door
and
went
back
into
the
house
she
called
jim
jim
where
are
you
at
last
he
came
stumping
up
from
some
mysterious
labour
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
what
he
said
startled
by
her
white
face
and
troubled
eyes
the
two
of
them
she
said
have
gone
out
on
to
the
moor
in
this
mist
it
is
safe
whatever
for
he
asked
how
should
i
know
she
went
out
first
and
now
he
after
her
safe
jim
you
best
follow
them
he
did
argue
with
her
being
an
obedient
husband
disciplined
by
many
years
of
matrimony
well
i
go
he
said
slowly
best
take
william
though
he
went
off
in
search
of
his
man
but
bolitho
need
not
trouble
half
an
hour
later
maggie
returned
stood
in
the
looking
about
her
took
off
her
jacket
and
hat
then
pursuing
her
own
thoughts
slowly
put
them
on
she
was
then
about
to
leave
the
room
when
the
door
burst
open
and
martin
tumbled
in
he
stood
at
the
doorway
staring
at
her
his
mouth
open
why
he
stammered
i
thought
i
thought
you
were
out
she
looked
at
him
crossly
you
should
have
gone
out
an
afternoon
like
this
if
i
been
here
well
you
were
you
should
have
gone
out
either
for
the
matter
of
that
and
i
was
at
the
circus
a
damned
poor
one
too
your
things
are
soaking
he
added
suddenly
looking
up
at
her
you
talk
about
me
you
better
go
and
change
i
going
out
again
she
said
out
again
yes
there
a
train
at
clinton
at
seven
i
catching
that
a
train
he
stared
at
her
completely
bewildered
yes
that
what
i
went
out
to
get
my
head
clear
about
martin
beaten
me
after
all
these
years
you
have
after
all
my
fine
speeches
too
he
began
to
drum
on
the
window
he
tried
to
speak
casually
i
have
beaten
you
maggie
yes
you
have
i
said
you
would
be
able
to
send
me
away
well
you
managed
to
and
in
the
only
way
you
could
by
your
silence
you
have
opened
your
mouth
for
a
fortnight
you
better
now
too
and
bolitho
will
look
after
you
i
was
determined
to
hang
on
to
you
but
i
find
i
ca
i
going
back
to
london
to
get
some
work
his
hand
dropped
from
the
window
then
with
his
head
turned
from
her
and
his
voice
so
low
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
the
no
maggie
do
go
she
smiled
across
at
him
there
no
need
to
be
polite
martin
both
of
us
beyond
that
by
this
time
i
come
back
if
you
really
want
me
you
know
that
i
always
will
but
at
last
after
all
these
years
i
found
a
scrap
of
here
am
i
always
bundling
about
first
the
aunts
then
you
then
paul
then
you
again
and
nobody
wanting
me
i
do
suppose
she
said
laughing
that
there
can
be
anybody
less
wanted
in
the
world
so
i
just
going
to
look
after
myself
now
it
quite
time
i
did
but
i
want
you
he
said
his
voice
still
very
low
she
looked
up
her
eyes
lit
as
though
with
some
sudden
recognition
if
you
really
mean
that
she
said
say
it
again
if
you
do
mean
it
do
humbug
me
i
wo
be
humbugged
any
more
i
have
humbugged
you
ever
he
answered
you
the
only
person
i
always
been
absolutely
straight
with
i
always
from
the
very
beginning
told
you
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
it
more
true
than
ever
now
i
been
trying
ever
since
you
came
back
to
me
in
london
to
get
you
to
leave
me
but
it
too
late
i
ca
fight
it
any
more
i
loved
you
all
the
time
i
was
abroad
i
ought
to
have
written
to
you
but
i
did
i
came
back
to
london
with
the
one
hope
of
seeing
you
but
determined
not
to
i
loved
you
more
than
ever
when
you
came
into
my
lodging
there
but
i
was
sick
and
had
any
money
besides
all
my
other
failings
the
only
decent
thing
i
ever
really
tried
to
do
to
keep
you
away
from
me
and
now
i
failed
in
that
when
i
came
in
and
found
you
were
gone
this
afternoon
i
thought
i
go
crazy
i
not
going
to
struggle
any
more
if
you
go
away
i
follow
you
wherever
you
go
i
may
as
well
try
to
give
up
keeping
you
out
of
it
it
like
keeping
myself
out
of
it
slowly
she
took
her
hat
and
coat
off
again
well
then
she
said
i
better
stay
i
suppose
he
suddenly
sat
down
his
face
white
she
came
across
to
him
she
put
her
hand
on
his
forehead
you
better
go
to
bed
martin
dear
i
bring
your
tea
in
he
caught
her
hand
she
knelt
down
put
her
arms
round
him
and
so
they
stayed
cheek
to
cheek
for
a
long
time
when
he
had
gone
to
his
room
she
sat
in
the
by
the
fire
her
hands
idly
folded
on
her
lap
she
let
happiness
pour
in
upon
her
as
water
floods
in
upon
a
dried
and
sultry
she
was
passive
her
tranquillity
was
rich
and
full
too
full
for
any
outward
expression
she
was
so
happy
that
her
heart
was
weighted
down
and
seemed
scarcely
to
beat
it
was
not
perhaps
the
exultant
happiness
that
she
had
expected
this
moment
to
bring
her
when
in
after
days
she
looked
back
to
that
quiet
by
the
fire
she
saw
that
it
was
then
that
she
had
passed
from
girlhood
into
womanhood
the
first
chapter
of
her
life
was
at
that
moment
laying
of
her
hand
on
martin
forehead
closed
the
love
for
him
that
filled
her
so
utterly
was
in
great
part
maternal
it
was
to
be
her
destiny
to
know
the
deep
tranquil
emotions
of
life
rather
than
the
passionate
and
transient
she
was
perhaps
the
more
blessed
in
that
even
now
at
the
very
instant
of
her
triumph
she
deceived
herself
in
nothing
there
were
many
difficulties
ahead
for
her
she
had
still
to
deal
with
paul
martin
was
not
a
perfect
character
nor
would
he
suddenly
become
one
above
all
that
strange
sense
of
being
a
captive
in
a
world
that
did
not
understand
her
some
one
curious
and
odd
and
alien
that
would
not
desert
her
that
also
was
true
of
martin
it
was
true
strangely
true
of
so
many
of
the
people
she
had
known
of
the
aunts
uncle
mathew
magnus
of
paul
and
of
grace
of
toms
and
even
perhaps
of
thurston
and
amy
warlock
all
captives
in
a
strange
country
trying
to
find
the
escape
each
in
his
or
her
own
fashion
back
to
the
land
of
their
birth
but
the
land
was
there
just
as
the
lion
whose
roar
very
faintly
she
could
hear
through
the
thick
walls
remembered
in
his
cage
the
jungles
and
mountains
of
his
happiness
so
was
she
aware
of
hers
the
land
was
there
the
fight
to
get
hack
to
it
was
real
she
smiled
to
herself
looking
back
on
the
years
many
people
would
have
said
that
she
had
had
no
very
happy
time
since
that
sudden
moment
of
her
father
death
but
it
did
not
seem
to
her
in
retrospect
unhappy
there
had
been
unhappy
times
tragic
times
but
life
was
always
bringing
forward
some
magnificent
moment
some
sudden
flash
of
splendour
that
made
up
for
all
the
rest
how
could
you
be
bitter
about
people
when
you
were
all
in
the
same
box
all
as
ignorant
as
blind
as
eager
to
do
well
as
fallible
as
brave
as
mistaken
the
thoughts
slipped
dimly
through
her
mind
she
was
too
happy
to
trace
them
truly
she
had
never
been
one
for
conscious
philosophy
nevertheless
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
life
was
worth
while
that
there
was
something
immortal
in
her
and
that
the
battle
was
good
to
fight
but
what
it
really
came
to
was
that
she
loved
martin
and
that
at
last
some
one
needed
her
that
she
need
never
be
lonely
any
more
bolitho
stepped
in
with
the
tea
i
take
it
in
to
him
maggie
said
standing
up
and
stretching
out
her
arms
for
the
tray
the
woman
looked
at
her
and
gave
a
little
ah
of
satisfaction
as
though
at
length
she
saw
in
maggie
eyes
that
for
which
she
had
been
searching
why
i
do
believe
she
said
that
walk
done
good
i
do
believe
maggie
said
laughing
it
has
carrying
the
tray
carefully
she
went
through
into
martin
room
