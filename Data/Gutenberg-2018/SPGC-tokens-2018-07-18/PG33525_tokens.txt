preface
every
experienced
teacher
must
have
noticed
the
difficulty
of
instructing
indian
children
out
of
books
that
are
specially
intended
for
use
in
english
schools
it
is
not
merely
that
the
subjects
are
unfamiliar
but
almost
every
phrase
has
english
associations
that
are
strange
to
indian
ears
the
environment
in
which
they
are
written
is
unknown
to
the
indian
school
boy
and
his
mind
becomes
overburdened
with
its
details
which
he
fails
to
understand
he
can
not
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
language
and
thus
master
it
quickly
the
present
indian
avoids
some
at
least
of
these
impediments
the
surroundings
described
in
it
are
those
of
the
students
everyday
life
the
sentiments
and
characters
are
familiar
the
stories
are
simply
told
and
the
notes
at
the
end
will
be
sufficient
to
explain
obscure
passages
it
should
be
possible
for
the
indian
student
to
follow
the
pages
of
the
book
easily
and
intelligently
those
students
who
have
read
the
stories
in
the
original
will
have
the
further
advantage
of
knowing
beforehand
the
whole
trend
of
the
narrative
and
thus
they
will
be
able
to
concentrate
their
thoughts
on
the
english
language
itself
it
is
proposed
to
publish
together
in
a
single
volume
the
original
stories
whose
english
translations
are
given
in
this
reader
versions
of
the
same
stories
in
the
different
indian
vernaculars
have
already
appeared
and
others
are
likely
to
follow
two
of
the
longest
stories
in
this
book
master
mashai
and
the
son
of
rashmani
are
reproduced
in
english
for
the
first
time
the
rest
of
the
stories
have
been
taken
with
slight
revision
from
two
english
volumes
entitled
the
hungry
stones
and
mashi
a
short
paragraph
has
been
added
from
the
original
bengali
at
the
end
of
the
story
called
the
postmaster
this
was
unfortunately
omitted
in
the
first
english
edition
the
list
of
words
to
be
studied
has
been
chosen
from
each
story
in
order
to
bring
to
notice
different
types
of
english
words
the
lists
are
in
no
sense
exhaustive
the
end
in
view
has
been
to
endeavour
to
create
an
interest
in
indian
words
and
their
history
which
may
lead
on
to
further
study

the
cabuliwallah
my
five
years
old
daughter
mini
can
not
live
without
chattering
i
really
believe
that
in
all
her
life
she
has
not
wasted
a
minute
in
silence
her
mother
is
often
vexed
at
this
and
would
stop
her
prattle
but
i
would
not
to
see
mini
quiet
is
unnatural
and
i
can
not
bear
it
long
and
so
my
own
talk
with
her
is
always
lively
one
morning
for
instance
when
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
seventeenth
chapter
of
my
new
novel
my
little
mini
stole
into
the
room
and
putting
her
hand
into
mine
said
father
ramdayal
the
calls
a
crow
a
krow
he
does
know
anything
does
he
before
i
could
explain
to
her
the
differences
of
language
in
this
world
she
was
embarked
on
the
full
tide
of
another
subject
what
do
you
think
father
bhola
says
there
is
an
elephant
in
the
clouds
blowing
water
out
of
his
trunk
and
that
is
why
it
rains
and
then
darting
off
anew
while
i
sat
still
making
ready
some
reply
to
this
last
saying
father
what
relation
is
mother
to
you
with
a
grave
face
i
contrived
to
say
go
and
play
with
bhola
mini
i
am
busy
the
window
of
my
room
overlooks
the
road
the
child
had
seated
herself
at
my
feet
near
my
table
and
was
playing
softly
drumming
on
her
knees
i
was
hard
at
work
on
my
seventeenth
chapter
where
pratap
singh
the
hero
had
just
caught
kanchanlata
the
heroine
in
his
arms
and
was
about
to
escape
with
her
by
the
window
of
the
castle
when
all
of
a
sudden
mini
left
her
play
and
ran
to
the
window
crying
a
cabuliwallah
a
cabuliwallah
sure
enough
in
the
street
below
was
a
cabuliwallah
passing
slowly
along
he
wore
the
loose
soiled
clothing
of
his
people
with
a
tall
turban
there
was
a
bag
on
his
back
and
he
carried
boxes
of
grapes
in
his
hand
i
can
not
tell
what
were
my
daughter
feelings
at
the
sight
of
this
man
but
she
began
to
call
him
loudly
ah
i
thought
he
will
come
in
and
my
seventeenth
chapter
will
never
be
finished
at
which
exact
moment
the
cabuliwallah
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
child
when
she
saw
this
overcome
by
terror
she
fled
to
her
mother
protection
and
disappeared
she
had
a
blind
belief
that
inside
the
bag
which
the
big
man
carried
there
were
perhaps
two
or
three
other
children
like
herself
the
pedlar
meanwhile
entered
my
doorway
and
greeted
me
with
a
smiling
face
so
precarious
was
the
position
of
my
hero
and
my
heroine
that
my
first
impulse
was
to
stop
and
buy
something
since
the
man
had
been
called
i
made
some
small
purchases
and
a
conversation
began
about
abdurrahman
the
russians
the
english
and
the
frontier
policy
as
he
was
about
to
leave
he
asked
and
where
is
the
little
girl
sir
and
i
thinking
that
mini
must
get
rid
of
her
false
fear
had
her
brought
out
she
stood
by
my
chair
and
looked
at
the
cabuliwallah
and
his
bag
he
offered
her
nuts
and
raisins
but
she
would
not
be
tempted
and
only
clung
the
closer
to
me
with
all
her
doubts
increased
this
was
their
first
meeting
one
morning
however
not
many
days
later
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
i
was
startled
to
find
mini
seated
on
a
bench
near
the
door
laughing
and
talking
with
the
great
cabuliwallah
at
her
feet
in
all
her
life
it
appeared
my
small
daughter
had
never
found
so
patient
a
listener
save
her
father
and
already
the
corner
of
her
little
was
stuffed
with
almonds
and
raisins
the
gift
of
her
visitor
why
did
you
give
her
those
i
said
and
taking
out
an
bit
i
handed
it
to
him
the
man
accepted
the
money
without
demur
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
alas
on
my
return
an
hour
later
i
found
the
unfortunate
coin
had
made
twice
its
own
worth
of
trouble
for
the
cabuliwallah
had
given
it
to
mini
and
her
mother
catching
sight
of
the
bright
round
object
had
pounced
on
the
child
with
where
did
you
get
that
bit
the
cabuliwallah
gave
it
me
said
mini
cheerfully
the
cabuliwallah
gave
it
you
cried
her
mother
much
shocked
o
mini
how
could
you
take
it
from
him
i
entering
at
the
moment
saved
her
from
impending
disaster
and
proceeded
to
make
my
own
inquiries
it
was
not
the
first
or
second
time
i
found
that
the
two
had
met
the
cabuliwallah
had
overcome
the
child
first
terror
by
a
judicious
bribery
of
nuts
and
almonds
and
the
two
were
now
great
friends
they
had
many
quaint
jokes
which
afforded
them
much
amusement
seated
in
front
of
him
looking
down
on
his
gigantic
frame
in
all
her
tiny
dignity
mini
would
ripple
her
face
with
laughter
and
begin
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
what
have
you
got
in
your
bag
and
he
would
reply
in
the
nasal
accents
of
the
mountaineer
an
elephant
not
much
cause
for
merriment
perhaps
but
how
they
both
enjoyed
the
fun
and
for
me
this
child
talk
with
a
man
had
always
in
it
something
strangely
fascinating
then
the
cabuliwallah
not
to
be
behindhand
would
take
his
turn
well
little
one
and
when
are
you
going
to
the
house
now
most
small
bengali
maidens
have
heard
long
ago
about
the
house
but
we
being
a
little
had
kept
these
things
from
our
child
and
mini
at
this
question
must
have
been
a
trifle
bewildered
but
she
would
not
show
it
and
with
ready
tact
replied
are
going
there
amongst
men
of
the
cabuliwallah
class
however
it
is
well
known
that
the
words
have
a
double
meaning
it
is
a
euphemism
for
the
place
where
we
are
well
cared
for
at
no
expense
to
ourselves
in
this
sense
would
the
sturdy
pedlar
take
my
daughter
question
ah
he
would
say
shaking
his
fist
at
an
invisible
policeman
i
will
thrash
my
hearing
this
and
picturing
the
poor
discomfited
relative
mini
would
go
off
into
peals
of
laughter
in
which
her
formidable
friend
would
join
these
were
autumn
mornings
the
very
time
of
year
when
kings
of
old
went
forth
to
conquest
and
i
never
stirring
from
my
little
corner
in
calcutta
would
let
my
mind
wander
over
the
whole
world
at
the
very
name
of
another
country
my
heart
would
go
out
to
it
and
at
the
sight
of
a
foreigner
in
the
streets
i
would
fall
to
weaving
a
network
of
dreams
the
mountains
the
glens
and
the
forests
of
his
distant
home
with
his
cottage
in
its
setting
and
the
free
and
independent
life
of
wilds
perhaps
the
scenes
of
travel
conjure
themselves
up
before
me
and
pass
and
repass
in
my
imagination
all
the
more
vividly
because
i
lead
such
a
vegetable
existence
that
a
call
to
travel
would
fall
upon
me
like
a
in
the
presence
of
this
cabuliwallah
i
was
immediately
transported
to
the
foot
of
arid
mountain
peaks
with
narrow
little
defiles
twisting
in
and
out
amongst
their
towering
heights
i
could
see
the
string
of
camels
bearing
the
merchandise
and
the
company
of
turbanned
merchants
carrying
some
their
queer
old
firearms
and
some
their
spears
journeying
downward
towards
the
plains
i
could
see
but
at
some
such
point
mini
mother
would
intervene
imploring
me
to
beware
of
that
man
mini
mother
is
unfortunately
a
very
timid
lady
whenever
she
hears
a
noise
in
the
street
or
sees
people
coming
towards
the
house
she
always
jumps
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
either
thieves
or
drunkards
or
snakes
or
tigers
or
malaria
or
cockroaches
or
caterpillars
even
after
all
these
years
of
experience
she
is
not
able
to
overcome
her
terror
so
she
was
full
of
doubts
about
the
cabuliwallah
and
used
to
beg
me
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
him
i
tried
to
laugh
her
fear
gently
away
but
then
she
would
turn
round
on
me
seriously
and
ask
me
solemn
questions
were
children
never
kidnapped
was
it
then
not
true
that
there
was
slavery
in
cabul
was
it
so
very
absurd
that
this
big
man
should
be
able
to
carry
off
a
tiny
child
i
urged
that
though
not
impossible
it
was
highly
improbable
but
this
was
not
enough
and
her
dread
persisted
as
it
was
indefinite
however
it
did
not
seem
right
to
forbid
the
man
the
house
and
the
intimacy
went
on
unchecked
once
a
year
in
the
middle
of
january
rahmun
the
cabuliwallah
was
in
the
habit
of
returning
to
his
country
and
as
the
time
approached
he
would
be
very
busy
going
from
house
to
house
collecting
his
debts
this
year
however
he
could
always
find
time
to
come
and
see
mini
it
would
have
seemed
to
an
outsider
that
there
was
some
conspiracy
between
the
two
for
when
he
could
not
come
in
the
morning
he
would
appear
in
the
evening
even
to
me
it
was
a
little
startling
now
and
then
in
the
corner
of
a
dark
room
suddenly
to
surprise
this
tall
much
bebagged
man
but
when
mini
would
run
in
smiling
with
her
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
and
the
two
friends
so
far
apart
in
age
would
subside
into
their
old
laughter
and
their
old
jokes
i
felt
reassured
one
morning
a
few
days
before
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
i
was
correcting
my
proof
sheets
in
my
study
it
was
chilly
weather
through
the
window
the
rays
of
the
sun
touched
my
feet
and
the
slight
warmth
was
very
welcome
it
was
almost
eight
and
the
early
pedestrians
were
returning
home
with
their
heads
covered
all
at
once
i
heard
an
uproar
in
the
street
and
looking
out
saw
rahmun
being
led
away
bound
between
two
policemen
and
behind
them
a
crowd
of
curious
boys
there
were
on
the
clothes
of
the
cabuliwallah
and
one
of
the
policemen
carried
a
knife
hurrying
out
i
stopped
them
and
inquired
what
it
all
meant
partly
from
one
partly
from
another
i
gathered
that
a
certain
neighbour
had
owed
the
pedlar
something
for
a
rampuri
shawl
but
had
falsely
denied
having
bought
it
and
that
in
the
course
of
the
quarrel
rahmun
had
struck
him
now
in
the
heat
of
his
excitement
the
prisoner
began
calling
his
enemy
all
sorts
of
names
when
suddenly
in
a
verandah
of
my
house
appeared
my
little
mini
with
her
usual
exclamation
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
rahmun
face
lighted
up
as
he
turned
to
her
he
had
no
bag
under
his
arm
so
she
could
not
discuss
the
elephant
with
him
she
at
once
therefore
proceeded
to
the
next
question
are
you
going
to
the
house
rahmun
laughed
and
said
just
where
i
am
going
little
one
then
seeing
that
the
reply
did
not
amuse
the
child
he
held
up
his
fettered
hands
ah
he
said
i
would
have
thrashed
that
old
but
my
hands
are
bound
on
a
charge
of
murderous
assault
rahmun
was
sentenced
to
some
imprisonment
time
passed
away
and
he
was
not
remembered
the
accustomed
work
in
the
accustomed
place
was
ours
and
the
thought
of
the
once
free
mountaineer
spending
his
years
in
prison
seldom
or
never
occurred
to
us
even
my
mini
i
am
ashamed
to
say
forgot
her
old
friend
new
companions
filled
her
life
as
she
grew
older
she
spent
more
of
her
time
with
girls
so
much
time
indeed
did
she
spend
with
them
that
she
came
no
more
as
she
used
to
do
to
her
father
room
i
was
scarcely
on
speaking
terms
with
her
years
had
passed
away
it
was
once
more
autumn
and
we
had
made
arrangements
for
our
mini
marriage
it
was
to
take
place
during
the
puja
holidays
with
durga
returning
to
kailas
the
light
of
our
home
also
was
to
depart
to
her
husband
house
and
leave
her
father
in
the
shadow
the
morning
was
bright
after
the
rains
there
was
a
sense
of
ablution
in
the
air
and
the
looked
like
pure
gold
so
bright
were
they
that
they
gave
a
beautiful
radiance
even
to
the
sordid
brick
walls
of
our
calcutta
lanes
since
early
dawn
that
day
the
had
been
sounding
and
at
each
beat
my
own
heart
throbbed
the
wail
of
the
tune
bhairavi
seemed
to
intensify
my
pain
at
the
approaching
separation
my
mini
was
to
be
married
that
night
from
early
morning
noise
and
bustle
had
pervaded
the
house
in
the
courtyard
the
canopy
had
to
be
slung
on
its
bamboo
poles
the
chandeliers
with
their
tinkling
sound
must
be
hung
in
each
room
and
verandah
there
was
no
end
of
hurry
and
excitement
i
was
sitting
in
my
study
looking
through
the
accounts
when
some
one
entered
saluting
respectfully
and
stood
before
me
it
was
rahmun
the
cabuliwallah
at
first
i
did
not
recognise
him
he
had
no
bag
nor
the
long
hair
nor
the
same
vigour
that
he
used
to
have
but
he
smiled
and
i
knew
him
again
when
did
you
come
rahmun
i
asked
him
last
evening
he
said
i
was
released
from
jail
the
words
struck
harsh
upon
my
ears
i
had
never
before
talked
with
one
who
had
wounded
his
fellow
and
my
heart
shrank
within
itself
when
i
realised
this
for
i
felt
that
the
day
would
have
been
had
he
not
turned
up
there
are
ceremonies
going
on
i
said
and
i
am
busy
could
you
perhaps
come
another
day
at
once
he
turned
to
go
but
as
he
reached
the
door
he
hesitated
and
said
may
i
not
see
the
little
one
sir
for
a
moment
it
was
his
belief
that
mini
was
still
the
same
he
had
pictured
her
running
to
him
as
she
used
calling
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
he
had
imagined
too
that
they
would
laugh
and
talk
together
just
as
of
old
in
fact
in
memory
of
former
days
he
had
brought
carefully
wrapped
up
in
paper
a
few
almonds
and
raisins
and
grapes
obtained
somehow
from
a
countryman
for
his
own
little
fund
was
dispersed
i
said
again
there
is
a
ceremony
in
the
house
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
any
one
the
man
face
fell
he
looked
wistfully
at
me
for
a
moment
then
said
good
morning
and
went
out
i
felt
a
little
sorry
and
would
have
called
him
back
but
i
found
he
was
returning
of
his
own
accord
he
came
close
up
to
me
holding
out
his
offerings
with
the
words
i
brought
these
few
things
sir
for
the
little
one
will
you
give
them
to
her
i
took
them
and
was
going
to
pay
him
but
he
caught
my
hand
and
said
you
are
very
kind
sir
keep
me
in
your
recollection
do
not
offer
me
money
you
have
a
little
girl
i
too
have
one
like
her
in
my
own
home
i
think
of
her
and
bring
fruits
to
your
child
not
to
make
a
profit
for
myself
saying
this
he
put
his
hand
inside
his
big
loose
robe
and
brought
out
a
small
and
dirty
piece
of
paper
with
great
care
he
unfolded
this
and
smoothed
it
out
with
both
hands
on
my
table
it
bore
the
impression
of
a
little
hand
not
a
photograph
not
a
drawing
the
impression
of
an
hand
laid
flat
on
the
paper
this
touch
of
his
own
little
daughter
had
been
always
on
his
heart
as
he
had
come
year
after
year
to
calcutta
to
sell
his
wares
in
the
streets
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
forgot
that
he
was
a
poor
cabuli
while
i
was
but
no
what
was
i
more
than
he
he
also
was
a
father
that
impression
of
the
hand
of
his
little
in
her
distant
mountain
home
reminded
me
of
my
own
little
mini
i
sent
for
mini
immediately
from
the
inner
apartment
many
difficulties
were
raised
but
i
would
not
listen
clad
in
the
red
silk
of
her
with
the
sandal
paste
on
her
forehead
and
adorned
as
a
young
bride
mini
came
and
stood
bashfully
before
me
the
cabuliwallah
looked
a
little
staggered
at
the
apparition
he
could
not
revive
their
old
friendship
at
last
he
smiled
and
said
little
one
are
you
going
to
your
house
but
mini
now
understood
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
she
could
not
reply
to
him
as
of
old
she
flushed
up
at
the
question
and
stood
before
him
with
her
face
turned
down
i
remembered
the
day
when
the
cabuliwallah
and
my
mini
had
first
met
and
i
felt
sad
when
she
had
gone
rahmun
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
the
idea
had
suddenly
come
to
him
that
his
daughter
too
must
have
grown
in
this
long
time
and
that
he
would
have
to
make
friends
with
her
anew
assuredly
he
would
not
find
her
as
he
used
to
know
her
and
besides
what
might
not
have
happened
to
her
in
these
eight
years
the
sounded
and
the
mild
autumn
sun
streamed
round
us
but
rahmun
sat
in
the
little
calcutta
lane
and
saw
before
him
the
barren
mountains
of
afghanistan
i
took
out
a
and
gave
it
to
him
saying
go
back
to
your
own
daughter
rahmun
in
your
own
country
and
may
the
happiness
of
your
meeting
bring
good
fortune
to
my
child
having
made
this
present
i
had
to
curtail
some
of
the
festivities
i
could
not
have
the
electric
lights
i
had
intended
nor
the
military
band
and
the
ladies
of
the
house
were
despondent
at
it
but
to
me
the
was
all
the
brighter
for
the
thought
that
in
a
distant
land
a
father
met
again
with

the
ii
the
phatik
chakravorti
was
ringleader
among
the
boys
of
the
village
a
new
mischief
got
into
his
head
there
was
a
heavy
log
lying
on
the
of
the
river
waiting
to
be
shaped
into
a
mast
for
a
boat
he
decided
that
they
should
all
work
together
to
shift
the
log
by
main
force
from
its
place
and
roll
it
away
the
owner
of
the
log
would
be
angry
and
surprised
and
they
would
all
enjoy
the
fun
every
one
seconded
the
proposal
and
it
was
carried
unanimously
but
just
as
the
fun
was
about
to
begin
mākhan
phatik
younger
brother
sauntered
up
and
sat
down
on
the
log
in
front
of
them
all
without
a
word
the
boys
were
puzzled
for
a
moment
he
was
pushed
rather
timidly
by
one
of
the
boys
and
told
to
get
up
but
he
remained
quite
unconcerned
he
appeared
like
a
young
philosopher
meditating
on
the
futility
of
games
phatik
was
furious
mākhan
he
cried
if
you
do
get
down
this
minute
i
thrash
you
mākhan
only
moved
to
a
more
comfortable
position
now
if
phatik
was
to
keep
his
regal
dignity
before
the
public
it
was
clear
he
ought
to
carry
out
his
threat
but
his
courage
failed
him
at
the
crisis
his
fertile
brain
however
rapidly
seized
upon
a
new
manœuvre
which
would
discomfit
his
brother
and
afford
his
followers
an
added
amusement
he
gave
the
word
of
command
to
roll
the
log
and
mākhan
over
together
mākhan
heard
the
order
and
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
stick
on
but
he
overlooked
the
fact
like
those
who
attempt
earthly
fame
in
other
matters
that
there
was
peril
in
it
the
boys
began
to
heave
at
the
log
with
all
their
might
calling
out
one
two
three
go
at
the
word
go
the
log
went
and
with
it
went
mākhan
philosophy
glory
and
all
the
other
boys
shouted
themselves
hoarse
with
delight
but
phatik
was
a
little
frightened
he
knew
what
was
coming
and
sure
enough
mākhan
rose
from
mother
earth
blind
as
fate
and
screaming
like
the
furies
he
rushed
at
phatik
and
scratched
his
face
and
beat
him
and
kicked
him
and
then
went
crying
home
the
first
act
of
the
drama
was
over
phatik
wiped
his
face
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
sunken
barge
by
the
river
bank
and
began
to
chew
a
piece
of
grass
a
boat
came
up
to
the
landing
and
a
man
with
grey
hair
and
dark
moustache
stepped
on
shore
he
saw
the
boy
sitting
there
doing
nothing
and
asked
him
where
the
chakravortis
lived
phatik
went
on
chewing
the
grass
and
said
over
there
but
it
was
quite
impossible
to
tell
where
he
pointed
the
stranger
asked
him
again
he
swung
his
legs
to
and
fro
on
the
side
of
the
barge
and
said
go
and
find
out
and
continued
to
chew
the
grass
as
before
but
now
a
servant
came
down
from
the
house
and
told
phatik
his
mother
wanted
him
phatik
refused
to
move
but
the
servant
was
the
master
on
this
occasion
he
took
phatik
up
roughly
and
carried
him
kicking
and
struggling
in
impotent
rage
when
phatik
came
into
the
house
his
mother
saw
him
she
called
out
angrily
so
you
have
been
hitting
mākhan
again
phatik
answered
indignantly
no
i
have
who
told
you
that
his
mother
shouted
do
tell
lies
you
have
phatik
said
sullenly
i
tell
you
i
have
you
ask
mākhan
but
mākhan
thought
it
best
to
stick
to
his
previous
statement
he
said
yes
mother
phatik
did
hit
me
phatik
patience
was
already
exhausted
he
could
not
bear
this
injustice
he
rushed
at
mākhan
and
hammered
him
with
blows
take
that
he
cried
and
that
and
that
for
telling
lies
his
mother
took
mākhan
side
in
a
moment
and
pulled
phatik
away
beating
him
with
her
hands
when
phatik
pushed
her
aside
she
shouted
out
what
you
little
villain
would
you
hit
your
own
mother
it
was
just
at
this
critical
juncture
that
the
stranger
arrived
he
asked
what
was
the
matter
phatik
looked
sheepish
and
ashamed
but
when
his
mother
stepped
back
and
looked
at
the
stranger
her
anger
was
changed
to
surprise
for
she
recognized
her
brother
and
cried
why
dada
where
have
you
come
from
as
she
said
these
words
she
bowed
to
the
ground
and
touched
his
feet
her
brother
had
gone
away
soon
after
she
had
married
and
he
had
started
business
in
bombay
his
sister
had
lost
her
husband
while
he
was
there
bishamber
had
now
come
back
to
calcutta
and
had
at
once
made
enquiries
about
his
sister
he
had
then
hastened
to
see
her
as
soon
as
he
found
out
where
she
was
the
next
few
days
were
full
of
rejoicing
the
brother
asked
after
the
education
of
the
two
boys
he
was
told
by
his
sister
that
phatik
was
a
perpetual
nuisance
he
was
lazy
disobedient
and
wild
but
mākhan
was
as
good
as
gold
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
and
very
fond
of
reading
bishamber
kindly
offered
to
take
phatik
off
his
sister
hands
and
educate
him
with
his
own
children
in
calcutta
the
widowed
mother
readily
agreed
when
his
uncle
asked
phatik
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
calcutta
with
him
his
joy
knew
no
bounds
and
he
said
oh
yes
uncle
in
a
way
that
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
meant
it
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
the
mother
to
get
rid
of
phatik
she
had
a
prejudice
against
the
boy
and
no
love
was
lost
between
the
two
brothers
she
was
in
daily
fear
that
he
would
either
drown
mākhan
some
day
in
the
river
or
break
his
head
in
a
fight
or
run
him
into
some
danger
at
the
same
time
she
was
a
little
distressed
to
see
extreme
eagerness
to
get
away
phatik
as
soon
as
all
was
settled
kept
asking
his
uncle
every
minute
when
they
were
to
start
he
was
on
pins
and
needles
all
day
long
with
excitement
and
lay
awake
most
of
the
night
he
bequeathed
to
mākhan
in
perpetuity
his
his
big
kite
and
his
marbles
indeed
at
this
time
of
departure
his
generosity
towards
mākhan
was
unbounded
when
they
reached
calcutta
phatik
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
aunt
for
the
first
time
she
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
this
unnecessary
addition
to
her
family
she
found
her
own
three
boys
quite
enough
to
manage
without
taking
any
one
else
and
to
bring
a
village
lad
of
fourteen
into
their
midst
was
terribly
upsetting
bishamber
should
really
have
thought
twice
before
committing
such
an
indiscretion
in
this
world
of
human
affairs
there
is
no
worse
nuisance
than
a
boy
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
is
neither
ornamental
nor
useful
it
is
impossible
to
shower
affection
on
him
as
on
a
little
boy
and
he
is
always
getting
in
the
way
if
he
talks
with
a
childish
lisp
he
is
called
a
baby
and
if
he
answers
in
a
way
he
is
called
impertinent
in
fact
any
talk
at
all
from
him
is
resented
then
he
is
at
the
unattractive
growing
age
he
grows
out
of
his
clothes
with
indecent
haste
his
voice
grows
hoarse
and
breaks
and
quavers
his
face
grows
suddenly
angular
and
unsightly
it
is
easy
to
excuse
the
shortcomings
of
early
childhood
but
it
is
hard
to
tolerate
even
unavoidable
lapses
in
a
boy
of
fourteen
the
lad
himself
becomes
painfully
when
he
talks
with
elderly
people
he
is
either
unduly
forward
or
else
so
unduly
shy
that
he
appears
ashamed
of
his
very
existence
yet
it
is
at
this
very
age
when
in
his
heart
of
hearts
a
young
lad
most
craves
for
recognition
and
love
and
he
becomes
the
devoted
slave
of
any
one
who
shows
him
consideration
but
none
dare
openly
love
him
for
that
would
be
regarded
as
undue
indulgence
and
therefore
bad
for
the
boy
so
what
with
scolding
and
chiding
he
becomes
very
much
like
a
stray
dog
that
has
lost
his
master
for
a
boy
of
fourteen
his
own
home
is
the
only
paradise
to
live
in
a
strange
house
with
strange
people
is
little
short
of
torture
while
the
height
of
bliss
is
to
receive
the
kind
looks
of
women
and
never
to
be
slighted
by
them
it
was
anguish
to
phatik
to
be
the
unwelcome
guest
in
his
aunt
house
despised
by
this
elderly
woman
and
slighted
on
every
occasion
if
ever
she
asked
him
to
do
anything
for
her
he
would
be
so
overjoyed
that
he
would
overdo
it
and
then
she
would
tell
him
not
to
be
so
stupid
but
to
get
on
with
his
lessons
the
cramped
atmosphere
of
neglect
oppressed
phatik
so
much
that
he
felt
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
he
wanted
to
go
out
into
the
open
country
and
fill
his
lungs
with
fresh
air
but
there
was
no
open
country
to
go
to
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
calcutta
houses
and
walls
he
would
dream
night
after
night
of
his
village
home
and
long
to
be
back
there
he
remembered
the
glorious
meadow
where
he
used
to
fly
his
kite
all
day
long
the
broad
where
he
would
wander
about
the
day
singing
and
shouting
for
joy
the
narrow
brook
where
he
could
go
and
dive
and
swim
at
any
time
he
liked
he
thought
of
his
band
of
boy
companions
over
whom
he
was
despot
and
above
all
the
memory
of
that
tyrant
mother
of
his
who
had
such
a
prejudice
against
him
occupied
him
day
and
night
a
kind
of
physical
love
like
that
of
animals
a
longing
to
be
in
the
presence
of
the
one
who
is
loved
an
inexpressible
wistfulness
during
absence
a
silent
cry
of
the
inmost
heart
for
the
mother
like
the
lowing
of
a
calf
in
the
twilight
this
love
which
was
almost
an
animal
instinct
agitated
the
shy
nervous
lean
uncouth
and
ugly
boy
no
one
could
understand
it
but
it
preyed
upon
his
mind
continually
there
was
no
more
backward
boy
in
the
whole
school
than
phatik
he
gaped
and
remained
silent
when
the
teacher
asked
him
a
question
and
like
an
overladen
ass
patiently
suffered
all
the
blows
that
came
down
on
his
back
when
other
boys
were
out
at
play
he
stood
wistfully
by
the
window
and
gazed
at
the
roofs
of
the
distant
houses
and
if
by
chance
he
espied
children
playing
on
the
open
terrace
of
any
roof
his
heart
would
ache
with
longing
one
day
he
summoned
up
all
his
courage
and
asked
his
uncle
uncle
when
can
i
go
home
his
uncle
answered
wait
till
the
holidays
come
but
the
holidays
would
not
come
till
october
and
there
was
a
long
time
still
to
wait
one
day
phatik
lost
his
lesson
book
even
with
the
help
of
books
he
had
found
it
very
difficult
indeed
to
prepare
his
lesson
now
it
was
impossible
day
after
day
the
teacher
would
cane
him
unmercifully
his
condition
became
so
abjectly
miserable
that
even
his
cousins
were
ashamed
to
own
him
they
began
to
jeer
and
insult
him
more
than
the
other
boys
he
went
to
his
aunt
at
last
and
told
her
that
he
had
lost
his
book
his
aunt
pursed
her
lips
in
contempt
and
said
you
great
clumsy
country
lout
how
can
i
afford
with
all
my
family
to
buy
you
new
books
five
times
a
month
that
night
on
his
way
back
from
school
phatik
had
a
bad
headache
with
a
fit
of
shivering
he
felt
he
was
going
to
have
an
attack
of
malarial
fever
his
one
great
fear
was
that
he
would
be
a
nuisance
to
his
aunt
the
next
morning
phatik
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
all
searches
in
the
neighbourhood
proved
futile
the
rain
had
been
pouring
in
torrents
all
night
and
those
who
went
out
in
search
of
the
boy
got
drenched
through
to
the
skin
at
last
bishamber
asked
help
from
the
police
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
police
van
stopped
at
the
door
before
the
house
it
was
still
raining
and
the
streets
were
all
flooded
two
constables
brought
out
phatik
in
their
arms
and
placed
him
before
bishamber
he
was
wet
through
from
head
to
foot
muddy
all
over
his
face
and
eyes
flushed
red
with
fever
and
his
limbs
trembling
bishamber
carried
him
in
his
arms
and
took
him
into
the
inner
apartments
when
his
wife
saw
him
she
exclaimed
what
a
heap
of
trouble
this
boy
has
given
us
had
you
better
send
him
home
phatik
heard
her
words
and
sobbed
out
loud
uncle
i
was
just
going
home
but
they
dragged
me
back
again
the
fever
rose
very
high
and
all
that
night
the
boy
was
delirious
bishamber
brought
in
a
doctor
phatik
opened
his
eyes
flushed
with
fever
and
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
and
said
vacantly
uncle
have
the
holidays
come
yet
bishamber
wiped
the
tears
from
his
own
eyes
and
took
phatik
lean
and
burning
hands
in
his
own
and
sat
by
him
through
the
night
the
boy
began
again
to
mutter
at
last
his
voice
became
excited
mother
he
cried
do
beat
me
like
that
mother
i
telling
the
truth
the
next
day
phatik
became
conscious
for
a
short
time
he
turned
his
eyes
about
the
room
as
if
expecting
some
one
to
come
at
last
with
an
air
of
disappointment
his
head
sank
back
on
the
pillow
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
with
a
deep
sigh
bishamber
knew
his
thoughts
and
bending
down
his
head
whispered
phatik
i
have
sent
for
your
mother
the
day
went
by
the
doctor
said
in
a
troubled
voice
that
the
condition
was
very
critical
phatik
began
to
cry
out
by
the
mark
three
fathoms
by
the
mark
four
fathoms
by
the
mark
he
had
heard
the
sailor
on
the
calling
out
the
mark
on
the
now
he
was
himself
plumbing
an
unfathomable
sea
later
in
the
day
phatik
mother
burst
into
the
room
like
a
whirlwind
and
began
to
toss
from
side
to
side
and
moan
and
cry
in
a
loud
voice
bishamber
tried
to
calm
her
agitation
but
she
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
cried
phatik
my
darling
my
darling
phatik
stopped
his
restless
movements
for
a
moment
his
hands
ceased
beating
up
and
down
he
said
eh
the
mother
cried
again
phatik
my
darling
my
darling
phatik
very
slowly
turned
his
head
and
without
seeing
anybody
said
mother
the
holidays
have
come
words
to
be
studied
from
the
latin
word
ponere
to
place
compare
from
the
latin
unus
one
and
animus
mind
compare
from
the
greek
philos
a
friend
and
sophia
wisdom
compare
a
french
word
which
has
found
its
home
in
english
french
is
frequently
giving
to
english
new
words
compare
in
this
story
from
the
latin
jungere
to
join
compare
from
the
negative
un
meaning
not
and
the
root
meaning
to
draw
compare
from
the
greek
word
atmos
the
air
and
sphaira
a
globe
compare
probably
from
the
english
word
wish
wishfulness
several
however
regard
it
as
coming
from
an
old
word
whist
or
wist

silent
the
vernacular
word
udās
has
the
same
meaning
from
the
latin

this

made
up
of
two
words
holy

the
religious
days
of
the

no

thus
they
got
the
meaning
of
holidays
as
opposed
to
working
days
once
there
was
a
king
iii
once
there
was
a
king
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
when
we
were
children
there
was
no
need
to
know
who
the
king
in
the
fairy
story
was
it
did
matter
whether
he
was
called
shiladitya
or
shaliban
whether
he
lived
at
kashi
or
kanauj
the
thing
that
made
a
boy
heart
go
thump
thump
with
delight
was
this
one
sovereign
truth
this
reality
of
all
realities
once
there
was
a
king
but
the
readers
of
this
modern
age
are
far
more
exact
and
exacting
when
they
hear
such
an
opening
to
a
story
they
are
at
once
critical
and
suspicious
they
apply
the
searchlight
of
science
to
its
legendary
haze
and
ask
which
king
the
have
become
more
precise
in
their
turn
they
are
no
longer
content
with
the
old
indefinite
there
was
a
king
but
assume
instead
a
look
of
profound
learning
and
begin
once
there
was
a
king
named
ajatasatru
the
modern
reader
curiosity
however
is
not
so
easily
satisfied
he
blinks
at
the
author
through
his
scientific
spectacles
and
asks
again
which
ajatasatru
when
we
were
young
we
understood
all
sweet
things
and
we
could
detect
the
sweets
of
a
fairy
story
by
an
unerring
science
of
our
own
we
never
cared
for
such
useless
things
as
knowledge
we
only
cared
for
truth
and
our
unsophisticated
little
hearts
knew
well
where
the
crystal
palace
of
truth
lay
and
how
to
reach
it
but
we
are
expected
to
write
pages
of
facts
while
the
truth
is
simply
this
there
was
a
king
i
remember
vividly
that
evening
in
calcutta
when
the
fairy
story
began
the
rain
and
the
storm
had
been
incessant
the
whole
of
the
city
was
flooded
the
water
was
in
our
lane
i
had
a
straining
hope
which
was
almost
a
certainty
that
my
tutor
would
be
prevented
from
coming
that
evening
i
sat
on
the
stool
in
the
far
corner
of
the
verandah
looking
down
the
lane
with
a
heart
beating
faster
and
faster
every
minute
i
kept
my
eye
on
the
rain
and
when
it
began
to
diminish
i
prayed
with
all
my
might
please
god
send
some
more
rain
till
seven
is
over
for
i
was
quite
ready
to
believe
that
there
was
no
other
need
for
rain
except
to
protect
one
helpless
boy
one
evening
in
one
corner
of
calcutta
from
the
deadly
clutches
of
his
tutor
if
not
in
answer
to
my
prayer
at
any
rate
according
to
some
grosser
law
of
nature
the
rain
did
not
give
up
but
alas
nor
did
my
teacher
exactly
to
the
minute
in
the
bend
of
the
lane
i
saw
his
approaching
umbrella
the
great
bubble
of
hope
burst
in
my
breast
and
my
heart
collapsed
truly
if
there
is
a
punishment
to
fit
the
crime
after
death
then
my
tutor
will
be
born
again
as
me
and
i
shall
be
born
as
my
tutor
as
soon
as
i
saw
his
umbrella
i
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
to
my
room
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
were
sitting
opposite
one
another
playing
cards
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
i
ran
into
the
room
and
flung
myself
on
the
bed
beside
my
mother
and
said
mother
the
tutor
has
come
and
i
have
such
a
bad
headache
could
i
have
no
lessons
i
hope
no
child
of
immature
age
will
be
allowed
to
read
this
story
and
i
sincerely
trust
it
will
not
be
used
in
or
primers
for
junior
classes
for
what
i
did
was
dreadfully
bad
and
i
received
no
punishment
whatever
on
the
contrary
my
wickedness
was
crowned
with
success
my
mother
said
to
me
all
right
and
turning
to
the
servant
added
tell
the
tutor
that
he
can
go
back
home
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
she
did
think
my
illness
very
serious
as
she
went
on
with
her
game
as
before
and
took
no
further
notice
and
i
also
burying
my
head
in
the
pillow
laughed
to
my
heart
content
we
perfectly
understood
one
another
my
mother
and
i
but
every
one
must
know
how
hard
it
is
for
a
boy
of
seven
years
old
to
keep
up
the
illusion
of
illness
for
a
long
time
after
about
a
minute
i
got
hold
of
grandmother
and
said
grannie
do
tell
me
a
story
i
had
to
ask
this
many
times
grannie
and
mother
went
on
playing
cards
and
took
no
notice
at
last
mother
said
to
me
child
do
bother
wait
till
we
finished
our
game
but
i
persisted
grannie
do
tell
me
a
story
i
told
mother
she
could
finish
her
game
but
she
must
let
grannie
tell
me
a
story
there
and
then
at
last
mother
threw
down
the
cards
and
said
you
had
better
do
what
he
wants
i
ca
manage
him
perhaps
she
had
it
in
her
mind
that
she
would
have
no
tiresome
tutor
on
the
morrow
while
i
should
be
obliged
to
be
back
at
those
stupid
lessons
as
soon
as
ever
mother
had
given
way
i
rushed
at
grannie
i
got
hold
of
her
hand
and
dancing
with
delight
dragged
her
inside
my
mosquito
curtain
on
to
the
bed
i
clutched
hold
of
the
bolster
with
both
hands
in
my
excitement
and
jumped
up
and
down
with
joy
and
when
i
had
got
a
little
quieter
said
now
grannie
let
have
the
story
grannie
went
on
and
the
king
had
a
queen
that
was
good
to
begin
with
he
had
only
one
it
is
usual
for
kings
in
fairy
stories
to
be
extravagant
in
queens
and
whenever
we
hear
that
there
are
two
queens
our
hearts
begin
to
sink
one
is
sure
to
be
unhappy
but
in
grannie
story
that
danger
was
past
he
had
only
one
queen
we
next
hear
that
the
king
had
not
got
any
son
at
the
age
of
seven
i
did
think
there
was
any
need
to
bother
if
a
man
had
no
son
he
might
only
have
been
in
the
way
nor
are
we
greatly
excited
when
we
hear
that
the
king
has
gone
away
into
the
forest
to
practise
austerities
in
order
to
get
a
son
there
was
only
one
thing
that
would
have
made
me
go
into
the
forest
and
that
was
to
get
away
from
my
tutor
but
the
king
left
behind
with
his
queen
a
small
girl
who
grew
up
into
a
beautiful
princess
twelve
years
pass
away
and
the
king
goes
on
practising
austerities
and
never
thinks
all
this
while
of
his
beautiful
daughter
the
princess
has
reached
the
full
bloom
of
her
youth
the
age
of
marriage
has
passed
but
the
king
does
not
return
and
the
queen
pines
away
with
grief
and
cries
is
my
golden
daughter
destined
to
die
unmarried
ah
me
what
a
fate
is
mine
then
the
queen
sent
men
to
the
king
to
entreat
him
earnestly
to
come
back
for
a
single
night
and
take
one
meal
in
the
palace
and
the
king
consented
the
queen
cooked
with
her
own
hand
and
with
the
greatest
care
dishes
she
made
a
seat
for
him
of
and
arranged
the
food
in
plates
of
gold
and
cups
of
silver
the
princess
stood
behind
with
the
fan
in
her
hand
the
king
after
twelve
absence
came
into
the
house
and
the
princess
waved
the
fan
lighting
up
all
the
room
with
her
beauty
the
king
looked
in
his
daughter
face
and
forgot
to
take
his
food
at
last
he
asked
his
queen
pray
who
is
this
girl
whose
beauty
shines
as
the
gold
image
of
the
goddess
whose
daughter
is
she
the
queen
beat
her
forehead
and
cried
ah
how
evil
is
my
fate
do
you
not
know
your
own
daughter
the
king
was
struck
with
amazement
he
said
at
last
my
tiny
daughter
has
grown
to
be
a
woman
what
else
the
queen
said
with
a
sigh
do
you
not
know
that
twelve
years
have
passed
by
but
why
did
you
not
give
her
in
marriage
asked
the
king
you
were
away
the
queen
said
and
how
could
i
find
her
a
suitable
husband
the
king
became
vehement
with
excitement
the
first
man
i
see
he
said
when
i
come
out
of
the
palace
shall
marry
her
the
princess
went
on
waving
her
fan
of
peacock
feathers
and
the
king
finished
his
meal
the
next
morning
as
the
king
came
out
of
his
palace
he
saw
the
son
of
a
brahman
gathering
sticks
in
the
forest
outside
the
palace
gates
his
age
was
about
seven
or
eight
the
king
said
i
will
marry
my
daughter
to
him
who
can
interfere
with
a
king
command
at
once
the
boy
was
called
and
the
marriage
garlands
were
exchanged
between
him
and
the
princess
at
this
point
i
came
up
close
to
my
wise
grannie
and
asked
her
eagerly
when
then
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
there
was
a
devout
wish
to
substitute
myself
for
that
fortunate
of
seven
years
old
the
night
was
resonant
with
the
patter
of
rain
the
earthen
lamp
by
my
bedside
was
burning
low
my
grandmother
voice
droned
on
as
she
told
the
story
and
all
these
things
served
to
create
in
a
corner
of
my
credulous
heart
the
belief
that
i
had
been
gathering
sticks
in
the
dawn
of
some
indefinite
time
in
the
kingdom
of
some
unknown
king
and
in
a
moment
garlands
had
been
exchanged
between
me
and
the
princess
beautiful
as
the
goddess
of
grace
she
had
a
gold
band
on
her
hair
and
gold
earrings
in
her
ears
she
had
a
necklace
and
bracelets
of
gold
and
a
golden
round
her
waist
and
a
pair
of
golden
anklets
tinkled
above
her
feet
if
my
grandmother
were
an
author
how
many
explanations
she
would
have
to
offer
for
this
little
story
first
of
all
every
one
would
ask
why
the
king
remained
twelve
years
in
the
forest
secondly
why
should
the
king
daughter
remain
unmarried
all
that
while
this
would
be
regarded
as
absurd
even
if
she
could
have
got
so
far
without
a
quarrel
still
there
would
have
been
a
great
hue
and
cry
about
the
marriage
itself
first
it
never
happened
secondly
how
could
there
be
a
marriage
between
a
princess
of
the
warrior
caste
and
a
boy
of
the
priestly
brahman
caste
her
readers
would
have
imagined
at
once
that
the
writer
was
preaching
against
our
social
customs
in
an
underhand
way
and
they
would
write
letters
to
the
papers
so
i
pray
with
all
my
heart
that
my
grandmother
may
be
born
a
grandmother
again
and
not
through
some
cursed
fate
take
birth
as
her
luckless
grandson
with
a
throb
of
joy
and
delight
i
asked
grannie
what
then
grannie
went
on
then
the
princess
took
her
little
husband
away
in
great
distress
and
built
a
large
palace
with
seven
wings
and
began
to
cherish
her
husband
with
great
care
i
jumped
up
and
down
in
my
bed
and
clutched
at
the
bolster
more
tightly
than
ever
and
said
what
then
grannie
continued
the
little
boy
went
to
school
and
learnt
many
lessons
from
his
teachers
and
as
he
grew
up
his
began
to
ask
him
who
is
that
beautiful
lady
living
with
you
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
the
brahman
son
was
eager
to
know
who
she
was
he
could
only
remember
how
one
day
he
had
been
gathering
sticks
and
a
great
disturbance
arose
but
all
that
was
so
long
ago
that
he
had
no
clear
recollection
four
or
five
years
passed
in
this
way
his
companions
always
asked
him
who
is
that
beautiful
lady
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
and
the
brahman
son
would
come
back
from
school
and
sadly
tell
the
princess
my
school
companions
always
ask
me
who
is
that
beautiful
lady
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
and
i
can
give
them
no
reply
tell
me
oh
tell
me
who
you
are
the
princess
said
let
it
pass
i
will
tell
you
some
other
day
and
every
day
the
brahman
son
would
ask
who
are
you
and
the
princess
would
reply
let
it
pass
i
will
tell
you
some
other
day
in
this
manner
four
or
five
more
years
passed
away
at
last
the
brahman
son
became
very
impatient
and
said
if
you
do
not
tell
me
who
you
are
o
beautiful
lady
i
will
leave
this
palace
with
the
seven
wings
then
the
princess
said
i
will
certainly
tell
you
next
day
the
brahman
son
as
soon
as
he
came
home
from
school
said
now
tell
me
who
you
are
the
princess
said
i
will
tell
you
after
supper
when
you
are
in
bed
the
brahman
son
said
very
well
and
he
began
to
count
the
hours
in
expectation
of
the
night
and
the
princess
on
her
side
spread
white
flowers
over
the
golden
bed
and
lighted
a
gold
lamp
with
fragrant
oil
and
adorned
her
hair
and
dressed
herself
in
a
beautiful
robe
of
blue
and
began
to
count
the
hours
in
expectation
of
the
night
that
evening
when
her
husband
the
brahman
son
had
finished
his
meal
too
excited
almost
to
eat
and
had
gone
to
the
golden
bed
in
the
bedchamber
strewn
with
flowers
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
surely
know
who
this
beautiful
lady
is
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
the
princess
took
for
her
food
that
which
was
left
over
by
her
husband
and
slowly
entered
the
bedchamber
she
had
to
answer
that
night
the
question
who
was
the
beautiful
lady
that
lived
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
and
as
she
went
up
to
the
bed
to
tell
him
she
found
a
serpent
had
crept
out
of
the
flowers
and
had
bitten
the
brahman
son
her
was
lying
on
the
bed
of
flowers
with
face
pale
in
death
my
heart
suddenly
ceased
to
throb
and
i
asked
with
choking
voice
what
then
grannie
said
then
but
what
is
the
use
of
going
on
any
further
with
the
story
it
would
only
lead
on
to
what
was
more
and
more
impossible
the
boy
of
seven
did
not
know
that
if
there
were
some
what
then
after
death
no
grandmother
of
a
grandmother
could
tell
us
all
about
it
but
the
child
faith
never
admits
defeat
and
it
would
snatch
at
the
mantle
of
death
itself
to
turn
him
back
it
would
be
outrageous
for
him
to
think
that
such
a
story
of
one
teacherless
evening
could
so
suddenly
come
to
a
stop
therefore
the
grandmother
had
to
call
back
her
story
from
the
chamber
of
the
great
end
but
she
does
it
so
simply
it
is
merely
by
floating
the
dead
body
on
a
banana
stem
on
the
river
and
having
some
incantations
read
by
a
magician
but
in
that
rainy
night
and
in
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
death
loses
all
its
horror
in
the
mind
of
the
boy
and
seems
nothing
more
than
a
deep
slumber
of
a
single
night
when
the
story
ends
the
tired
eyelids
are
weighed
down
with
sleep
thus
it
is
that
we
send
the
little
body
of
the
child
floating
on
the
back
of
sleep
over
the
still
water
of
time
and
then
in
the
morning
read
a
few
verses
of
incantation
to
restore
him
to
the
world

life

raicharan
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
came
as
a
servant
to
his
house
he
belonged
to
the
same
caste
as
his
master
and
was
given
his
master
little
son
to
nurse
as
time
went
on
the
boy
left
arms
to
go
to
school
from
school
he
went
on
to
college
and
after
college
he
entered
the
judicial
service
always
until
he
married
raicharan
was
his
sole
attendant
but
when
a
mistress
came
into
the
house
raicharan
found
two
masters
instead
of
one
all
his
former
influence
passed
to
the
new
mistress
this
was
compensated
by
a
fresh
arrival
anukul
had
a
son
born
to
him
and
raicharan
by
his
unsparing
attentions
soon
got
a
complete
hold
over
the
child
he
used
to
toss
him
up
in
his
arms
call
to
him
in
absurd
baby
language
put
his
face
close
to
the
baby
and
draw
it
away
again
with
a
laugh
presently
the
child
was
able
to
crawl
and
cross
the
doorway
when
raicharan
went
to
catch
him
he
would
scream
with
mischievous
laughter
and
make
for
safety
raicharan
was
amazed
at
the
profound
skill
and
exact
judgment
the
baby
showed
when
pursued
he
would
say
to
his
mistress
with
a
look
of
awe
and
mystery
your
son
will
be
a
judge
some
day
new
wonders
came
in
their
turn
when
the
baby
began
to
toddle
that
was
to
raicharan
an
epoch
in
human
history
when
he
called
his
father
and
his
mother
and
raicharan
then
raicharan
ecstasy
knew
no
bounds
he
went
out
to
tell
the
news
to
all
the
world
after
a
while
raicharan
was
asked
to
show
his
ingenuity
in
other
ways
he
had
for
instance
to
play
the
part
of
a
horse
holding
the
reins
between
his
teeth
and
prancing
with
his
feet
he
had
also
to
wrestle
with
his
little
charge
and
if
he
could
not
by
a
wrestler
trick
fall
on
his
back
defeated
at
the
end
a
great
outcry
was
certain
about
this
time
anukul
was
transferred
to
a
district
on
the
banks
of
the
padma
on
his
way
through
calcutta
he
bought
his
son
a
little
he
bought
him
also
a
yellow
satin
waistcoat
a
cap
and
some
gold
bracelets
and
anklets
raicharan
was
wont
to
take
these
out
and
put
them
on
his
little
charge
with
ceremonial
pride
whenever
they
went
for
a
walk
then
came
the
rainy
season
and
day
after
day
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
the
hungry
river
like
an
enormous
serpent
swallowed
down
terraces
villages
cornfields
and
covered
with
its
flood
the
tall
grasses
and
wild
casuarinas
on
the
sandbanks
from
time
to
time
there
was
a
deep
thud
as
the
crumbled
the
unceasing
roar
of
the
main
current
could
be
heard
from
far
away
masses
of
foam
carried
swiftly
past
proved
to
the
eye
the
swiftness
of
the
stream
one
afternoon
the
rain
cleared
it
was
cloudy
but
cool
and
bright
raicharan
little
despot
did
not
want
to
stay
in
on
such
a
fine
afternoon
his
lordship
climbed
into
the
raicharan
between
the
shafts
dragged
him
slowly
along
till
he
reached
the
on
the
banks
of
the
river
there
was
no
one
in
the
fields
and
no
boat
on
the
stream
across
the
water
on
the
farther
side
the
clouds
were
rifted
in
the
west
the
silent
ceremonial
of
the
setting
sun
was
revealed
in
all
its
glowing
splendour
in
the
midst
of
that
stillness
the
child
all
of
a
sudden
pointed
with
his
finger
in
front
of
him
and
cried
pitty
fow
close
by
on
a
stood
a
large
tree
in
full
flower
my
lord
the
baby
looked
at
it
with
greedy
eyes
and
raicharan
knew
his
meaning
only
a
short
time
before
he
had
made
out
of
these
very
flower
balls
a
small
and
the
child
had
been
so
entirely
happy
dragging
it
about
with
a
string
that
for
the
whole
day
raicharan
was
not
asked
to
put
on
the
reins
at
all
he
was
promoted
from
a
horse
into
a
groom
but
raicharan
had
no
wish
that
evening
to
go
splashing
through
the
mud
to
reach
the
flowers
so
he
quickly
pointed
his
finger
in
the
opposite
direction
calling
out
look
baby
look
look
at
the
bird
and
with
all
sorts
of
curious
noises
he
pushed
the
rapidly
away
from
the
tree
but
a
child
destined
to
be
a
judge
can
not
be
put
off
so
easily
and
besides
there
was
at
the
time
nothing
to
attract
his
eyes
and
you
can
not
keep
up
for
ever
the
pretence
of
an
imaginary
bird
the
little
master
mind
was
made
up
and
raicharan
was
at
his
end
very
well
baby
he
said
at
last
you
sit
still
in
the
cart
and
i
go
and
get
you
the
pretty
flower
only
mind
you
do
go
near
the
water
as
he
said
this
he
made
his
legs
bare
to
the
knee
and
waded
through
the
oozing
mud
towards
the
tree
the
moment
raicharan
had
gone
his
little
master
thoughts
went
off
at
racing
speed
to
the
forbidden
water
the
baby
saw
the
river
rushing
by
splashing
and
gurgling
as
it
went
it
seemed
as
though
the
disobedient
wavelets
themselves
were
running
away
from
some
greater
raicharan
with
the
laughter
of
a
thousand
children
at
the
sight
of
their
mischief
the
heart
of
the
human
child
grew
excited
and
restless
he
got
down
stealthily
from
the
and
toddled
off
towards
the
river
on
his
way
he
picked
up
a
small
stick
and
leant
over
the
bank
of
the
stream
pretending
to
fish
the
mischievous
fairies
of
the
river
with
their
mysterious
voices
seemed
inviting
him
into
their
raicharan
had
plucked
a
handful
of
flowers
from
the
tree
and
was
carrying
them
back
in
the
end
of
his
cloth
with
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
but
when
he
reached
the
there
was
no
one
there
he
looked
on
all
sides
and
there
was
no
one
there
he
looked
back
at
the
cart
and
there
was
no
one
there
in
that
first
terrible
moment
his
blood
froze
within
him
before
his
eyes
the
whole
universe
swam
round
like
a
dark
mist
from
the
depth
of
his
broken
heart
he
gave
one
piercing
cry
master
master
little
master
but
no
voice
answered
no
child
laughed
mischievously
back
no
scream
of
baby
delight
welcomed
his
return
only
the
river
ran
on
with
its
splashing
gurgling
noise
as
before
as
though
it
knew
nothing
at
all
and
had
no
time
to
attend
to
such
a
tiny
human
event
as
the
death
of
a
child
as
the
evening
passed
by
raicharan
mistress
became
very
anxious
she
sent
men
out
on
all
sides
to
search
they
went
with
lanterns
in
their
hands
and
reached
at
last
the
banks
of
the
padma
there
they
found
raicharan
rushing
up
and
down
the
fields
like
a
stormy
wind
shouting
the
cry
of
despair
master
master
little
master
when
they
got
raicharan
home
at
last
he
fell
prostrate
at
the
feet
of
his
mistress
they
shook
him
and
questioned
him
and
asked
him
repeatedly
where
he
had
left
the
child
but
all
he
could
say
was
that
he
knew
nothing
though
every
one
held
the
opinion
that
the
padma
had
swallowed
the
child
there
was
a
lurking
doubt
left
in
the
mind
for
a
band
of
gipsies
had
been
noticed
outside
the
village
that
afternoon
and
some
suspicion
rested
on
them
the
mother
went
so
far
in
her
wild
grief
as
to
think
it
possible
that
raicharan
himself
had
stolen
the
child
she
called
him
aside
with
piteous
entreaty
and
said
raicharan
give
me
back
my
baby
give
me
back
my
child
take
from
me
any
money
you
ask
but
give
me
back
my
child
raicharan
only
beat
his
forehead
in
reply
his
mistress
ordered
him
out
of
the
house
anukul
tried
to
reason
his
wife
out
of
this
wholly
unjust
suspicion
why
on
earth
he
said
should
he
commit
such
a
crime
as
that
the
mother
only
replied
the
baby
had
gold
ornaments
on
his
body
who
knows
it
was
impossible
to
reason
with
her
after
that
ii
raicharan
went
back
to
his
own
village
up
to
this
time
he
had
had
no
son
and
there
was
no
hope
that
any
child
would
now
be
born
to
him
but
it
came
about
before
the
end
of
a
year
that
his
wife
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
died
an
overwhelming
resentment
at
first
grew
up
in
raicharan
heart
at
the
sight
of
this
new
baby
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
resentful
suspicion
that
it
had
come
as
a
usurper
in
place
of
the
little
master
he
also
thought
it
would
be
a
grave
offence
to
be
happy
with
a
son
of
his
own
after
what
had
happened
to
his
master
little
child
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
widowed
sister
who
mothered
the
new
baby
it
would
not
have
lived
long
but
a
change
gradually
came
over
raicharan
mind
a
wonderful
thing
happened
this
new
baby
in
turn
began
to
crawl
about
and
cross
the
doorway
with
mischief
in
its
face
it
also
showed
an
amusing
cleverness
in
making
its
escape
to
safety
its
voice
its
sounds
of
laughter
and
tears
its
gestures
were
those
of
the
little
master
on
some
days
when
raicharan
listened
to
its
crying
his
heart
suddenly
began
thumping
wildly
against
his
ribs
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
former
little
master
was
crying
somewhere
in
the
unknown
land
of
death
because
he
had
lost
his
phailna
for
that
was
the
name
raicharan
sister
gave
to
the
new
baby
soon
began
to
talk
it
learnt
to
say
and
with
a
baby
accent
when
raicharan
heard
those
familiar
sounds
the
mystery
suddenly
became
clear
the
little
master
could
not
cast
off
the
spell
of
his
and
therefore
he
had
been
reborn
in
his
own
house
the
three
arguments
in
favour
of
this
were
to
raicharan
altogether
beyond
dispute
the
new
baby
was
born
soon
after
his
little
master
death
his
wife
could
never
have
accumulated
such
merit
as
to
give
birth
to
a
son
in
middle
age
the
new
baby
walked
with
a
toddle
and
called
out
and
there
was
no
sign
lacking
which
marked
out
the
future
judge
then
suddenly
raicharan
remembered
that
terrible
accusation
of
the
mother
ah
he
said
to
himself
with
amazement
the
mother
heart
was
right
she
knew
i
had
stolen
her
child
when
once
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
he
was
filled
with
remorse
for
his
past
neglect
he
now
gave
himself
over
body
and
soul
to
the
new
baby
and
became
its
devoted
attendant
he
began
to
bring
it
up
as
if
it
were
the
son
of
a
rich
man
he
bought
a
a
yellow
satin
waistcoat
and
a
cap
he
melted
down
the
ornaments
of
his
dead
wife
and
made
gold
bangles
and
anklets
he
refused
to
let
the
little
child
play
with
any
one
of
the
neighbourhood
and
became
himself
its
sole
companion
day
and
night
as
the
baby
grew
up
to
boyhood
he
was
so
petted
and
spoilt
and
clad
in
such
finery
that
the
village
children
would
call
him
your
lordship
and
jeer
at
him
and
older
people
regarded
raicharan
as
unaccountably
crazy
about
the
child
at
last
the
time
came
for
the
boy
to
go
to
school
raicharan
sold
his
small
piece
of
land
and
went
to
calcutta
there
he
got
employment
with
great
difficulty
as
a
servant
and
sent
phailna
to
school
he
spared
no
pains
to
give
him
the
best
education
the
best
clothes
the
best
food
meanwhile
he
himself
lived
on
a
mere
handful
of
rice
and
would
say
in
secret
ah
my
little
master
my
dear
little
master
you
loved
me
so
much
that
you
came
back
to
my
house
you
shall
never
suffer
from
any
neglect
of
mine
twelve
years
passed
away
in
this
manner
the
boy
was
able
to
read
and
write
well
he
was
bright
and
healthy
and
he
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
his
personal
appearance
and
was
specially
careful
in
parting
his
hair
he
was
inclined
to
extravagance
and
finery
and
spent
money
freely
he
could
never
quite
look
on
raicharan
as
a
father
because
though
fatherly
in
affection
he
had
the
manner
of
a
servant
a
further
fault
was
this
that
raicharan
kept
secret
from
every
one
that
he
himself
was
the
father
of
the
child
the
students
of
the
hostel
where
phailna
was
a
boarder
were
greatly
amused
by
raicharan
country
manners
and
i
have
to
confess
that
behind
his
father
back
phailna
joined
in
their
fun
but
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
all
the
students
loved
the
innocent
and
old
man
and
phailna
was
very
fond
of
him
also
but
as
i
have
said
before
he
loved
him
with
a
kind
of
condescension
raicharan
grew
older
and
older
and
his
employer
was
continually
finding
fault
with
him
for
his
incompetent
work
he
had
been
starving
himself
for
the
boy
sake
so
he
had
grown
physically
weak
and
no
longer
up
to
his
daily
task
he
would
forget
things
and
his
mind
became
dull
and
stupid
but
his
employer
expected
a
full
servant
work
out
of
him
and
would
not
brook
excuses
the
money
that
raicharan
had
brought
with
him
from
the
sale
of
his
land
was
exhausted
the
boy
was
continually
grumbling
about
his
clothes
and
asking
for
more
money
iii
raicharan
made
up
his
mind
he
gave
up
the
situation
where
he
was
working
as
a
servant
and
left
some
money
with
phailna
and
said
i
have
some
business
to
do
at
home
in
my
village
and
shall
be
back
soon
he
went
off
at
once
to
baraset
where
anukul
was
magistrate
wife
was
still
broken
down
with
grief
she
had
had
no
other
child
one
day
anukul
was
resting
after
a
long
and
weary
day
in
court
his
wife
was
buying
at
an
exorbitant
price
a
herb
from
a
mendicant
quack
which
was
said
to
ensure
the
birth
of
a
child
a
voice
of
greeting
was
heard
in
the
courtyard
anukul
went
out
to
see
who
was
there
it
was
raicharan
anukul
heart
was
softened
when
he
saw
his
old
servant
he
asked
him
many
questions
and
offered
to
take
him
back
into
service
raicharan
smiled
faintly
and
said
in
reply
i
want
to
make
obeisance
to
my
mistress
anukul
went
with
raicharan
into
the
house
where
the
mistress
did
not
receive
him
as
warmly
as
his
old
master
raicharan
took
no
notice
of
this
but
folded
his
hands
and
said
it
was
not
the
padma
that
stole
your
baby
it
was
i
anukul
exclaimed
great
god
eh
what
where
is
he
raicharan
replied
he
is
with
me
i
will
bring
him
the
day
after
it
was
sunday
there
was
no
magistrate
court
sitting
both
husband
and
wife
were
looking
expectantly
along
the
road
waiting
from
early
morning
for
raicharan
appearance
at
ten
he
came
leading
phailna
by
the
hand
anukul
wife
without
a
question
took
the
boy
into
her
lap
and
was
wild
with
excitement
sometimes
laughing
sometimes
weeping
touching
him
kissing
his
hair
and
his
forehead
and
gazing
into
his
face
with
hungry
eager
eyes
the
boy
was
very
and
dressed
like
a
gentleman
son
the
heart
of
anukul
brimmed
over
with
a
sudden
rush
of
affection
nevertheless
the
magistrate
in
him
asked
have
you
any
proofs
raicharan
said
how
could
there
be
any
proof
of
such
a
deed
god
alone
knows
that
i
stole
your
boy
and
no
one
else
in
the
world
when
anukul
saw
how
eagerly
his
wife
was
clinging
to
the
boy
he
realised
the
futility
of
asking
for
proofs
it
would
be
wiser
to
believe
and
then
where
could
an
old
man
like
raicharan
get
such
a
boy
from
and
why
should
his
faithful
servant
deceive
him
for
nothing
but
he
added
severely
raicharan
you
must
not
stay
here
where
shall
i
go
master
said
raicharan
in
a
choking
voice
folding
his
hands
i
am
old
who
will
take
in
an
old
man
as
a
servant
the
mistress
said
let
him
stay
my
child
will
be
pleased
i
forgive
him
but
anukul
magisterial
conscience
would
not
allow
him
no
he
said
he
can
not
be
forgiven
for
what
he
has
done
raicharan
bowed
to
the
ground
and
clasped
anukul
feet
master
he
cried
let
me
stay
it
was
not
i
who
did
it
it
was
god
anukul
conscience
was
more
shocked
than
ever
when
raicharan
tried
to
put
the
blame
on
god
shoulders
no
he
said
i
could
not
allow
it
i
can
not
trust
you
any
more
you
have
done
an
act
of
treachery
raicharan
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
it
was
not
i
who
did
it
who
was
it
then
asked
anukul
raicharan
replied
it
was
my
fate
but
no
educated
man
could
take
this
for
an
excuse
anukul
remained
obdurate
when
phailna
saw
that
he
was
the
wealthy
magistrate
son
and
not
raicharan
he
was
angry
at
first
thinking
that
he
had
been
cheated
all
this
time
of
his
birthright
but
seeing
raicharan
in
distress
he
generously
said
to
his
father
father
forgive
him
even
if
you
let
him
live
with
us
let
him
have
a
small
monthly
pension
after
hearing
this
raicharan
did
not
utter
another
word
he
looked
for
the
last
time
on
the
face
of
his
son
he
made
obeisance
to
his
old
master
and
mistress
then
he
went
out
and
was
mingled
with
the
numberless
people
of
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
month
anukul
sent
him
some
money
to
his
village
but
the
money
came
back
there
was

the

and
the
clerks
from

office

he
is
so
careful
with
his
money
that
even
the
most
dogged
efforts
of
the
boys
from
the
local
football
club
fail
to
make
any
impression
on
his
pocket
at
the
time
this
story
opens
a
new
guest
came
into
his
household
after
a
long
period
of
despair
his
wife
nanibala
bore
him
a
son
the
child
resembled
his
mother
large
eyes
nose
and
fair
complexion
ratikanta
adharlal
protégé
gave
verdict
he
is
worthy
of
this
noble
house
they
named
him
venugopal
never
before
had
adharlal
wife
expressed
any
opinion
differing
from
her
husband
on
household
expenses
there
had
been
a
hot
discussion
now
and
then
about
the
propriety
of
some
necessary
item
and
up
to
this
time
she
had
merely
acknowledged
defeat
with
silent
contempt
but
now
adharlal
could
no
longer
maintain
his
supremacy
he
had
to
give
way
little
by
little
when
things
for
his
son
were
in
question
ii
as
venugopal
grew
up
his
father
gradually
became
accustomed
to
spending
money
on
him
he
obtained
an
old
teacher
who
had
a
considerable
repute
for
his
learning
and
also
for
his
success
in
dragging
impassable
boys
through
their
examinations
but
such
a
training
does
not
lead
to
the
cultivation
of
amiability
this
man
tried
his
best
to
win
the
heart
but
the
little
that
was
left
in
him
of
the
natural
milk
of
human
kindness
had
turned
sour
and
the
child
repulsed
his
advances
from
the
very
beginning
the
mother
in
consequence
objected
to
him
strongly
and
complained
that
the
very
sight
of
him
made
her
boy
ill
so
the
teacher
left
just
then
haralal
made
his
appearance
with
a
dirty
dress
and
a
torn
pair
of
old
canvas
shoes
haralal
mother
who
was
a
widow
had
kept
him
with
great
difficulty
at
a
district
school
out
of
the
scanty
earnings
which
she
made
by
cooking
in
strange
houses
and
husking
rice
he
managed
to
pass
the
matriculation
and
determined
to
go
to
college
as
a
result
of
his
condition
his
pinched
face
tapered
to
a
point
in
an
unnatural
manner
like
cape
comorin
in
the
map
of
india
and
the
only
broad
portion
of
it
was
his
forehead
which
resembled
the
ranges
of
the
himalayas
the
servant
asked
haralal
what
he
wanted
and
he
answered
timidly
that
he
wished
to
see
the
master
the
servant
answered
sharply
you
ca
see
him
haralal
was
hesitating
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
when
venugopal
who
had
finished
his
game
in
the
garden
suddenly
came
to
the
door
the
servant
shouted
at
haralal
get
away
quite
unaccountably
venugopal
grew
excited
and
cried
no
he
sha
get
away
and
he
dragged
the
stranger
to
his
father
adharlal
had
just
risen
from
his
sleep
and
was
sitting
quietly
on
the
upper
verandah
in
his
cane
chair
rocking
his
legs
ratikanta
was
enjoying
his
hookah
seated
in
a
chair
next
to
him
he
asked
haralal
how
far
he
had
got
in
his
reading
the
young
man
bent
his
head
and
answered
that
he
had
passed
the
matriculation
ratikanta
looked
stern
and
expressed
surprise
that
he
should
be
so
backward
for
his
age
haralal
kept
silence
it
was
ratikanta
special
pleasure
to
torture
his
patron
dependants
whether
actual
or
potential
suddenly
it
struck
adharlal
that
he
would
be
able
to
employ
this
youth
as
a
tutor
for
his
son
on
next
to
nothing
he
agreed
there
and
then
to
take
him
at
a
salary
of
five
rupees
a
month
with
board
and
lodging
free
iii
this
time
the
post
of
tutor
remained
occupied
longer
than
before
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
haralal
and
his
pupil
became
great
friends
never
before
did
haralal
have
such
an
opportunity
of
loving
any
young
human
creature
his
mother
had
been
so
poor
and
dependent
that
he
had
never
had
the
privilege
of
playing
with
the
children
where
she
was
employed
at
work
he
had
not
hitherto
suspected
the
hidden
stores
of
love
which
lay
all
the
while
accumulating
in
his
own
heart
venu
also
was
glad
to
find
a
companion
in
haralal
he
was
the
only
boy
in
the
house
his
two
younger
sisters
were
looked
down
upon
as
unworthy
of
being
his
playmates
so
his
new
tutor
became
his
only
companion
patiently
bearing
the
undivided
weight
of
the
tyranny
of
his
child
friend
iv
venu
was
now
eleven
haralal
had
passed
his
intermediate
winning
a
scholarship
he
was
working
hard
for
his
degree
after
college
lectures
were
over
he
would
take
venu
out
into
the
public
park
and
tell
him
stories
about
the
heroes
from
greek
history
and
victor
romances
the
child
used
to
get
quite
impatient
to
run
to
haralal
after
school
hours
in
spite
of
his
mother
attempts
to
keep
him
by
her
side
this
displeased
nanibala
she
thought
that
it
was
a
plot
of
haralal
to
captivate
her
boy
in
order
to
prolong
his
own
appointment
one
day
she
talked
to
him
from
behind
the
purdah
it
is
your
duty
to
teach
my
son
only
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
morning
and
evening
but
why
are
you
always
with
him
the
child
has
nearly
forgotten
his
own
parents
you
must
understand
that
a
man
of
your
position
is
no
fit
companion
for
a
boy
belonging
to
this
house
haralal
voice
choked
a
little
as
he
answered
that
for
the
future
he
would
merely
be
venu
teacher
and
would
keep
away
from
him
at
other
times
it
was
haralal
usual
practice
to
begin
his
college
study
early
before
dawn
the
child
would
come
to
him
directly
after
he
had
washed
himself
there
was
a
small
pool
in
the
garden
and
they
used
to
feed
the
fish
in
it
with
puffed
rice
venu
was
also
engaged
in
building
a
miniature
at
the
corner
of
the
garden
with
its
liliputian
gates
and
hedges
and
gravel
paths
when
the
sun
became
too
hot
they
would
go
back
into
the
house
and
venu
would
have
his
morning
lesson
from
haralal
on
the
day
in
question
venu
had
risen
earlier
than
usual
because
he
wished
to
hear
the
end
of
the
story
which
haralal
had
begun
the
evening
before
but
he
found
his
teacher
absent
when
asked
about
him
the
said
that
he
had
gone
out
at
lesson
time
venu
remained
unnaturally
quiet
he
never
even
asked
haralal
why
he
had
gone
out
but
went
on
mechanically
with
his
lessons
when
the
child
was
with
his
mother
taking
his
breakfast
she
asked
him
what
had
happened
to
make
him
so
gloomy
and
why
he
was
not
eating
his
food
venu
gave
no
answer
after
his
meal
his
mother
caressed
him
and
questioned
him
repeatedly
venu
burst
out
crying
and
said
master
mashai
his
mother
asked
venu
what
about
master
mashai
but
venu
found
it
difficult
to
name
the
offence
which
his
teacher
had
committed
his
mother
said
to
venu
has
your
master
mashai
been
saying
anything
to
you
against
venu
could
not
understand
the
question
and
went
away
v
there
was
a
theft
in
adhar
babu
house
the
police
were
called
in
to
investigate
even
haralal
trunks
were
searched
ratikanta
said
with
meaning
the
man
who
steals
anything
does
not
keep
his
thefts
in
his
own
box
adharlal
called
his
son
tutor
and
said
to
him
it
will
not
be
convenient
for
me
to
keep
any
of
you
in
my
own
house
from
you
will
have
to
take
up
your
quarters
outside
only
coming
in
to
teach
my
son
at
the
proper
time
ratikanta
said
sagely
drawing
at
his
hookah
that
is
a
good
proposal
good
for
both
parties
haralal
did
not
utter
a
word
but
he
sent
a
letter
saying
that
it
would
be
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
remain
as
tutor
to
venu
when
venu
came
back
from
school
he
found
his
tutor
room
empty
even
that
broken
steel
trunk
of
his
was
absent
the
rope
was
stretched
across
the
corner
but
there
were
no
clothes
or
towel
hanging
on
it
only
on
the
table
which
formerly
was
strewn
with
books
and
papers
stood
a
bowl
containing
some
with
a
label
on
which
was
written
the
word
venu
in
haralal
the
boy
ran
up
at
once
to
his
father
and
asked
him
what
had
happened
his
father
told
him
that
haralal
had
resigned
his
post
venu
went
to
his
room
and
flung
himself
down
and
began
to
cry
adharlal
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
the
next
day
when
haralal
was
sitting
on
his
wooden
bedstead
in
the
hostel
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
attend
his
college
lectures
suddenly
he
saw
adhar
babu
servant
coming
into
his
room
followed
by
venu
venu
at
once
ran
up
to
him
and
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
asking
him
to
come
back
to
the
house
haralal
could
not
explain
why
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
go
back
but
the
memory
of
those
clinging
arms
and
that
pathetic
request
used
to
choke
his
breath
with
emotion
long
after
vi
haralal
found
out
after
this
that
his
mind
was
in
an
unsettled
state
and
that
he
had
but
a
small
chance
of
winning
the
scholarship
even
if
he
could
pass
the
examination
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
without
the
scholarship
he
could
not
continue
his
studies
so
he
tried
to
get
employment
in
some
office
fortunately
for
him
an
english
manager
of
a
big
merchant
firm
took
a
fancy
to
him
at
first
sight
after
only
a
brief
exchange
of
words
the
manager
asked
him
if
he
had
any
experience
and
could
he
bring
any
testimonial
haralal
could
only
answer
no
nevertheless
a
post
was
offered
him
of
twenty
rupees
a
month
and
fifteen
rupees
were
allowed
him
in
advance
to
help
him
to
come
properly
dressed
to
the
office
the
manager
made
haralal
work
extremely
hard
he
had
to
stay
on
after
office
hours
and
sometimes
go
to
his
master
house
late
in
the
evening
but
in
this
way
he
learnt
his
work
quicker
than
others
and
his
fellow
clerks
became
jealous
of
him
and
tried
to
injure
him
but
without
effect
he
rented
a
small
house
in
a
narrow
lane
and
brought
his
mother
to
live
with
him
as
soon
as
his
salary
was
raised
to
forty
rupees
a
month
thus
happiness
came
back
to
his
mother
after
weary
years
of
waiting
haralal
mother
used
to
express
a
desire
to
see
venugopal
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
much
she
wished
to
prepare
some
dishes
with
her
own
hand
and
to
ask
him
to
come
just
once
to
dine
with
her
son
haralal
avoided
the
subject
by
saying
that
his
house
was
not
big
enough
to
invite
him
for
that
purpose
vii
the
news
reached
haralal
that
venu
mother
had
died
he
could
not
wait
a
moment
but
went
at
once
to
adharlal
house
to
see
venu
after
that
they
began
to
see
each
other
frequently
but
times
had
changed
venu
stroking
his
budding
moustache
had
grown
quite
a
young
man
of
fashion
friends
befitting
his
present
condition
were
numerous
that
old
dilapidated
study
chair
and
desk
had
vanished
and
the
room
now
seemed
to
be
bursting
with
pride
at
its
new
acquisitions
its
oleographs
and
other
furniture
venu
had
entered
college
but
showed
no
haste
in
crossing
the
boundary
of
the
intermediate
examination
haralal
remembered
his
mother
request
to
invite
venu
to
dinner
after
great
hesitation
he
did
so
venugopal
with
his
handsome
face
at
once
won
the
mother
heart
but
as
soon
as
ever
the
meal
was
over
he
became
impatient
to
go
and
looking
at
his
gold
watch
he
explained
that
he
had
pressing
engagements
elsewhere
then
he
jumped
into
his
carriage
which
was
waiting
at
the
door
and
drove
away
haralal
with
a
sigh
said
to
himself
that
he
would
never
invite
him
again
viii
one
day
on
returning
from
office
haralal
noticed
the
presence
of
a
man
in
the
dark
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
his
house
possibly
he
would
have
passed
him
by
had
not
the
heavy
scent
of
some
foreign
perfume
attracted
his
attention
haralal
asked
who
was
there
and
the
answer
came
it
is
i
master
mashai
what
is
the
matter
venu
said
haralal
when
did
you
arrive
i
came
hours
ago
said
venu
i
did
not
know
that
you
returned
so
late
they
went
upstairs
together
and
haralal
lighted
the
lamp
and
asked
venu
whether
all
was
well
venu
replied
that
his
college
classes
were
becoming
a
fearful
bore
and
his
father
did
not
realize
how
dreadfully
hard
it
was
for
him
to
go
on
in
the
same
class
year
after
year
with
students
much
younger
than
himself
haralal
asked
him
what
he
wished
to
do
venu
then
told
him
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
england
and
become
a
barrister
he
gave
an
instance
of
a
student
much
less
advanced
than
himself
who
was
getting
ready
to
go
haralal
asked
him
if
he
had
received
his
father
permission
venu
replied
that
his
father
would
not
hear
a
word
of
it
until
he
had
passed
the
intermediate
and
that
was
an
impossibility
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
haralal
suggested
that
he
himself
should
go
and
try
to
talk
over
his
father
no
said
venu
i
can
never
allow
that
haralal
asked
venu
to
stay
for
dinner
and
while
they
were
waiting
he
gently
placed
his
hand
on
venu
shoulder
and
said
venu
you
should
not
quarrel
with
your
father
or
leave
home
venu
jumped
up
angrily
and
said
that
if
he
was
not
welcome
he
could
go
elsewhere
haralal
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
implored
him
not
to
go
away
without
taking
his
food
but
venu
snatched
away
his
hand
and
was
just
leaving
the
room
when
haralal
mother
brought
the
food
in
on
a
tray
on
seeing
venu
about
to
leave
she
pressed
him
to
remain
and
he
did
so
with
bad
grace
while
he
was
eating
the
sound
of
a
carriage
stopping
at
the
door
was
heard
first
a
servant
entered
the
room
with
creaking
shoes
and
then
adhar
babu
himself
venu
face
became
pale
the
mother
left
the
room
as
soon
as
she
saw
strangers
enter
adhar
babu
called
out
to
haralal
in
a
voice
thick
with
anger
ratikanta
gave
me
full
warning
but
i
could
not
believe
that
you
had
such
devilish
cunning
hidden
in
you
so
you
think
you
going
to
live
upon
venu
this
is
sheer
kidnapping
and
i
shall
prosecute
you
in
the
police
court
venu
silently
followed
his
father
and
went
out
of
the
house
ix
the
firm
to
which
haralal
belonged
began
to
buy
up
large
quantities
of
rice
and
dhal
from
the
country
districts
to
pay
for
this
haralal
had
to
take
the
cash
every
saturday
morning
by
the
early
train
and
disburse
it
there
were
special
centres
where
the
brokers
and
middlemen
would
come
with
their
receipts
and
accounts
for
settlement
some
discussion
had
taken
place
in
the
office
about
haralal
being
entrusted
with
this
work
without
any
security
but
the
manager
undertook
all
the
responsibility
and
said
that
a
security
was
not
needed
this
special
work
used
to
go
on
from
the
middle
of
december
to
the
middle
of
april
haralal
would
get
back
from
it
very
late
at
night
one
day
after
his
return
he
was
told
by
his
mother
that
venu
had
called
and
that
she
had
persuaded
him
to
take
his
dinner
at
their
house
this
happened
more
than
once
the
mother
said
that
it
was
because
venu
missed
his
own
mother
and
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
about
it
one
day
venu
waited
for
haralal
to
return
and
had
a
long
talk
with
him
master
mashai
he
said
father
has
become
so
cantankerous
of
late
that
i
can
not
live
with
him
any
longer
and
besides
i
know
that
he
is
getting
ready
to
marry
again
ratikanta
is
seeking
a
suitable
match
and
they
are
always
conspiring
about
it
there
used
to
be
a
time
when
my
father
would
get
anxious
if
i
were
absent
from
home
even
for
a
few
hours
now
if
i
am
away
for
more
than
a
week
he
takes
no
notice
indeed
he
is
greatly
relieved
if
this
marriage
takes
place
i
feel
that
i
can
not
live
in
the
house
any
longer
you
must
show
me
a
way
out
of
this
i
want
to
become
independent
haralal
felt
deeply
pained
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
help
his
former
pupil
venu
said
that
he
was
determined
to
go
to
england
and
become
a
barrister
somehow
or
other
he
must
get
the
passage
money
out
of
his
father
he
could
borrow
it
on
a
note
of
hand
and
his
father
would
have
to
pay
when
the
creditors
filed
a
suit
with
this
borrowed
money
he
would
get
away
and
when
he
was
in
england
his
father
was
certain
to
remit
his
expenses
but
who
is
there
haralal
asked
who
would
advance
you
the
money
you
said
venu
i
exclaimed
haralal
in
amazement
yes
said
venu
i
seen
the
servant
bringing
heaps
of
money
here
in
bags
the
servant
and
the
money
belong
to
someone
else
haralal
explained
why
the
money
came
to
his
house
at
night
like
birds
to
their
nest
to
be
scattered
next
morning
but
ca
the
manager
advance
the
sum
venu
asked
he
may
do
so
said
haralal
if
your
father
stands
security
the
discussion
ended
at
this
point
x
one
friday
night
a
carriage
and
pair
stopped
before
haralal
lodging
house
when
venu
was
announced
haralal
was
counting
money
in
his
bedroom
seated
on
the
floor
venu
entered
the
room
dressed
in
a
strange
manner
he
had
discarded
his
bengali
dress
and
was
wearing
a
parsee
coat
and
trousers
and
had
a
cap
on
his
head
rings
were
prominent
on
almost
all
the
fingers
of
both
hands
and
a
thick
gold
chain
was
hanging
round
his
neck
there
was
a
in
his
pocket
and
diamond
studs
could
be
seen
peeping
from
his
shirt
sleeves
haralal
at
once
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
and
why
he
was
wearing
that
dress
my
father
marriage
said
venu
comes
off
he
tried
hard
to
keep
it
from
me
but
i
found
it
out
i
asked
him
to
allow
me
to
go
to
our
at
barrackpur
for
a
few
days
and
he
was
only
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
i
am
going
there
and
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
to
come
back
haralal
looked
pointedly
at
the
rings
on
his
fingers
venu
explained
that
they
had
belonged
to
his
mother
haralal
then
asked
him
if
he
had
already
had
his
dinner
he
answered
yes
have
you
had
yours
no
said
haralal
i
can
not
leave
this
room
until
i
have
all
the
money
safely
locked
up
in
this
iron
chest
go
and
take
your
dinner
said
venu
while
i
keep
guard
here
your
mother
will
be
waiting
for
you
for
a
moment
haralal
hesitated
and
then
he
went
out
and
had
his
dinner
in
a
short
time
he
came
back
with
his
mother
and
the
three
of
them
sat
among
the
bags
of
money
talking
together
when
it
was
about
midnight
venu
took
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
and
jumped
up
saying
that
he
would
miss
his
train
then
he
asked
haralal
to
keep
all
his
rings
and
his
watch
and
chain
until
he
asked
for
them
again
haralal
put
them
all
together
in
a
leather
bag
and
laid
it
in
the
iron
safe
venu
went
out
the
canvas
bags
containing
the
currency
notes
had
already
been
placed
in
the
safe
only
the
loose
coins
remained
to
be
counted
over
and
put
away
with
the
rest
xi
haralal
lay
down
on
the
floor
of
the
same
room
with
the
key
under
his
pillow
and
went
to
sleep
he
dreamt
that
venu
mother
was
loudly
reproaching
him
from
behind
the
curtain
her
words
were
indistinct
but
rays
of
different
colours
from
the
jewels
on
her
body
kept
piercing
the
curtain
like
needles
and
violently
vibrating
haralal
struggled
to
call
venu
but
his
voice
seemed
to
forsake
him
at
last
with
a
noise
the
curtain
fell
down
haralal
started
up
from
his
sleep
and
found
darkness
piled
up
round
about
him
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
had
flung
open
the
window
and
put
out
the
light
haralal
whole
body
was
wet
with
perspiration
he
relighted
the
lamp
and
saw
by
the
clock
that
it
was
four
in
the
morning
there
was
no
time
to
sleep
again
for
he
had
to
get
ready
to
start
after
haralal
had
washed
his
face
and
hands
his
mother
called
from
her
own
room
baba
why
are
you
up
so
soon
it
was
the
habit
of
haralal
to
see
his
mother
face
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
in
order
to
bring
a
blessing
upon
the
day
his
mother
said
to
him
i
was
dreaming
that
you
were
going
out
to
bring
back
a
bride
for
yourself
haralal
went
to
his
own
bedroom
and
began
to
take
out
the
bags
containing
the
silver
and
the
currency
notes
suddenly
his
heart
stopped
beating
three
of
the
bags
appeared
to
be
empty
he
knocked
them
against
the
iron
safe
but
this
only
proved
his
fear
to
be
true
he
opened
them
and
shook
them
with
all
his
might
two
letters
from
venu
dropped
out
from
one
of
the
bags
one
was
addressed
to
his
father
and
one
to
haralal
haralal
tore
open
his
own
letter
and
began
reading
the
words
seemed
to
run
into
one
another
he
trimmed
the
lamp
but
felt
as
if
he
could
not
understand
what
he
read
yet
the
purport
of
the
letter
was
clear
venu
had
taken
three
thousand
rupees
in
currency
notes
and
had
started
for
england
the
steamer
was
to
sail
before
that
very
morning
the
letter
ended
with
the
words
i
am
explaining
everything
in
a
letter
to
my
father
he
will
pay
off
the
debt
and
then
again
my
ornaments
which
i
have
left
in
your
care
will
more
than
cover
the
amount
i
have
taken
haralal
locked
up
his
room
and
hired
a
carriage
and
went
with
all
haste
to
the
jetty
but
he
did
not
know
even
the
name
of
the
steamer
which
venu
had
taken
he
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
wharves
from
ghat
to
metiaburuj
he
found
that
two
steamers
had
started
on
their
voyage
to
england
early
that
morning
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
know
which
of
them
carried
venu
or
how
to
reach
him
when
haralal
got
home
the
sun
was
strong
and
the
whole
of
calcutta
was
awake
everything
before
his
eyes
seemed
blurred
he
felt
as
if
he
were
pushing
against
a
fearful
obstacle
which
was
bodiless
and
without
pity
his
mother
came
on
the
verandah
to
ask
him
anxiously
where
he
had
gone
with
a
dry
laugh
he
said
to
her
to
bring
home
a
bride
for
myself
and
then
he
fainted
away
on
opening
his
eyes
after
a
while
haralal
asked
his
mother
to
leave
him
entering
his
room
he
shut
the
door
from
the
inside
while
his
mother
remained
seated
on
the
floor
of
the
verandah
in
the
fierce
glare
of
the
sun
she
kept
calling
to
him
fitfully
almost
mechanically
baba
baba
the
servant
came
from
the
manager
office
and
knocked
at
the
door
saying
that
they
would
miss
the
train
if
they
did
not
start
out
at
once
haralal
called
from
inside
it
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
start
this
morning
then
where
are
we
to
go
sir
i
will
tell
you
later
on
the
servant
went
downstairs
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
suddenly
haralal
thought
of
the
ornaments
which
venu
had
left
behind
up
till
now
he
had
completely
forgotten
about
them
but
with
the
thought
came
instant
relief
he
took
the
leather
bag
containing
them
and
also
venu
letter
to
his
father
and
left
the
house
before
he
reached
adharlal
house
he
could
hear
the
bands
playing
for
the
wedding
yet
on
entering
he
could
feel
that
there
had
been
some
disturbance
haralal
was
told
that
there
had
been
a
theft
the
night
before
and
one
or
two
servants
were
suspected
adhar
babu
was
sitting
in
the
upper
verandah
flushed
with
anger
and
ratikanta
was
smoking
his
hookah
haralal
said
to
adhar
babu
i
have
something
private
to
tell
you
adharlal
flared
up
i
have
no
time
now
he
was
afraid
that
haralal
had
come
to
borrow
money
or
to
ask
his
help
ratikanta
suggested
that
if
there
was
any
delicacy
in
making
the
request
in
his
presence
he
would
leave
the
place
adharlal
told
him
angrily
to
sit
where
he
was
then
haralal
handed
over
the
bag
which
venu
had
left
behind
adharlal
asked
what
was
inside
it
and
haralal
opened
it
and
gave
the
contents
into
his
hands
then
adhar
babu
said
with
a
sneer
it
a
paying
business
that
you
two
have
started
you
and
your
former
pupil
you
were
certain
that
the
stolen
property
would
be
traced
and
so
you
come
along
with
it
to
me
to
claim
a
reward
haralal
presented
the
letter
which
venu
had
written
to
his
father
this
only
made
adharlal
all
the
more
furious
what
all
this
he
shouted
i
call
for
the
police
my
son
has
not
yet
come
of
age
and
have
smuggled
him
out
of
the
country
bet
my
soul
you
lent
him
a
few
hundred
rupees
and
then
taken
a
note
of
hand
for
three
thousand
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
bound
by
i
never
advanced
him
any
money
at
all
said
haralal
then
how
did
he
find
it
said
adharlal
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
broke
open
your
safe
and
stole
it
haralal
stood
silent
ratikanta
sarcastically
remarked
i
do
believe
this
fellow
ever
set
hands
on
as
much
as
three
thousand
rupees
in
his
life
when
haralal
left
the
house
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
of
dreading
anything
or
even
of
being
anxious
his
mind
seemed
to
refuse
to
work
directly
he
entered
the
lane
he
saw
a
carriage
waiting
before
his
own
lodging
for
a
moment
he
felt
certain
that
it
was
venu
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
his
calamity
could
be
so
hopelessly
final
haralal
went
up
quickly
but
found
an
english
assistant
from
the
firm
sitting
inside
the
carriage
the
man
came
out
when
he
saw
haralal
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
asked
him
why
did
you
go
out
by
train
this
morning
the
servant
had
told
the
manager
his
suspicions
and
he
had
sent
this
man
to
find
out
haralal
answered
notes
to
the
amount
of
three
thousand
rupees
are
missing
the
man
asked
how
that
could
have
happened
haralal
remained
silent
the
man
said
to
haralal
let
us
go
upstairs
together
and
see
where
you
keep
your
money
they
went
up
to
the
room
and
counted
the
money
and
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
when
the
mother
saw
this
she
could
not
contain
herself
any
longer
she
came
out
before
the
stranger
and
said
baba
what
has
happened
he
answered
in
broken
hindustani
that
some
money
had
been
stolen
stolen
the
mother
cried
why
how
could
it
be
stolen
who
could
do
such
a
dastardly
thing
haralal
said
to
her
mother
do
say
a
word
the
man
collected
the
remainder
of
the
money
and
told
haralal
to
come
with
him
to
the
manager
the
mother
barred
the
way
and
said
sir
where
are
you
taking
my
son
i
have
brought
him
up
starving
and
straining
to
do
honest
work
my
son
would
never
touch
money
belonging
to
others
the
englishman
not
knowing
bengali
said
achcha
achcha
haralal
told
his
mother
not
to
be
anxious
he
would
explain
it
all
to
the
manager
and
soon
be
back
again
the
mother
entreated
him
with
a
distressed
voice
baba
you
have
taken
a
morsel
of
food
all
morning
haralal
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
drove
away
and
the
mother
sank
to
the
ground
in
the
anguish
of
her
heart
the
manager
said
to
haralal
tell
me
the
truth
what
did
happen
haralal
said
to
him
i
have
taken
any
money
i
fully
believe
it
said
the
manager
but
surely
you
know
who
has
taken
it
haralal
looked
on
the
ground
and
remained
silent
somebody
said
the
manager
must
have
taken
it
away
with
your
connivance
nobody
replied
haralal
could
take
it
away
with
my
knowledge
without
taking
first
my
life
look
here
haralal
said
the
manager
i
trusted
you
completely
i
took
no
security
i
employed
you
in
a
post
of
great
responsibility
every
one
in
the
office
was
against
me
for
doing
so
the
three
thousand
rupees
is
a
small
matter
but
the
shame
of
all
this
to
me
is
a
great
matter
i
will
do
one
thing
i
will
give
you
the
whole
day
to
bring
back
this
money
if
you
do
so
i
shall
say
nothing
about
it
and
i
will
keep
you
on
in
your
post
it
was
now
eleven
haralal
with
bent
head
went
out
of
the
office
the
clerks
began
to
discuss
the
affair
with
exultation
what
can
i
what
can
i
haralal
repeated
to
himself
as
he
walked
along
like
one
dazed
the
sun
heat
pouring
down
upon
him
at
last
his
mind
ceased
to
think
at
all
about
what
could
be
done
but
the
mechanical
walk
went
on
without
ceasing
this
city
of
calcutta
which
offered
its
shelter
to
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
had
become
like
a
steel
trap
he
could
see
no
way
out
the
whole
body
of
people
were
conspiring
to
surround
and
hold
him
captive
this
most
insignificant
of
men
whom
no
one
knew
nobody
had
any
special
grudge
against
him
yet
everybody
was
his
enemy
the
crowd
passed
by
brushing
against
him
the
clerks
of
the
offices
were
eating
their
lunch
on
the
road
side
from
their
plates
made
of
leaves
a
tired
wayfarer
on
the
maidan
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
was
lying
with
one
hand
beneath
his
head
and
one
leg
upraised
over
the
other
the
women
crowded
into
hackney
carriages
were
wending
their
way
to
the
temple
a
chuprassie
came
up
with
a
letter
and
asked
him
the
address
on
the
envelope
so
the
afternoon
went
by
then
came
the
time
when
the
offices
were
all
about
to
close
carriages
started
off
in
all
directions
carrying
people
back
to
their
homes
the
clerks
packed
tightly
on
the
seats
of
the
trams
looked
at
the
theatre
advertisements
as
they
returned
to
their
lodgings
from
haralal
had
neither
his
work
in
the
office
nor
release
from
work
in
the
evening
he
had
no
need
to
hurry
to
catch
the
tram
to
take
him
to
his
home
all
the
busy
occupations
of
the
city
the
buildings
the
horses
and
carriages
the
incessant
traffic
seemed
now
at
one
time
to
swell
into
dreadful
reality
and
at
another
time
to
subside
into
the
shadowy
unreal
haralal
had
taken
neither
food
nor
rest
nor
shelter
all
that
day
the
street
lamps
were
lighted
from
one
road
to
another
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
watchful
darkness
like
some
demon
was
keeping
its
eyes
wide
open
to
guard
every
movement
of
its
victim
haralal
did
not
even
have
the
energy
to
enquire
how
late
it
was
the
veins
on
his
forehead
throbbed
and
he
felt
as
if
his
head
would
burst
through
the
paroxysms
of
pain
which
alternated
with
the
apathy
of
dejection
only
one
thought
came
again
and
again
to
his
mind
among
the
innumerable
multitudes
in
that
vast
city
only
one
name
found
its
way
through
his
dry
throat
mother
he
said
to
himself
at
the
deep
of
night
when
no
one
is
awake
to
capture
me
me
who
am
the
least
of
all
men
i
will
silently
creep
to
my
mother
arms
and
fall
asleep
and
may
i
never
wake
again
haralal
one
trouble
was
lest
some
police
officer
should
molest
him
in
the
presence
of
his
mother
and
this
kept
him
back
from
going
home
when
it
became
impossible
for
him
at
last
to
bear
the
weight
of
his
own
body
he
hailed
a
carriage
the
driver
asked
him
where
he
wanted
to
go
he
said
nowhere
i
want
to
drive
across
the
maidan
to
get
the
fresh
air
the
man
at
first
did
not
believe
him
and
was
about
to
drive
on
when
haralal
put
a
rupee
into
his
hand
as
an
advance
payment
thereupon
the
driver
crossed
and
then
the
maidan
from
one
side
to
the
other
traversing
the
different
roads
haralal
laid
his
throbbing
head
on
the
side
of
the
open
window
of
the
carriage
and
closed
his
eyes
slowly
all
the
pain
abated
his
body
became
cool
a
deep
and
intense
peace
filled
his
heart
and
a
supreme
deliverance
seemed
to
embrace
him
on
every
side
it
was
true
the
day
despair
which
threatened
him
with
its
grip
of
utter
helplessness
it
was
true
it
was
false
he
knew
now
that
it
was
only
an
empty
fear
of
the
mind
deliverance
was
in
the
infinite
sky
and
there
was
no
end
to
peace
no
king
or
emperor
in
the
world
had
the
power
to
keep
captive
this
nonentity
this
haralal
in
the
sky
surrounding
his
emancipated
heart
on
every
side
he
felt
the
presence
of
his
mother
that
one
poor
woman
she
seemed
to
grow
and
grow
till
she
filled
the
infinity
of
darkness
all
the
roads
and
buildings
and
shops
of
calcutta
gradually
became
enveloped
by
her
in
her
presence
vanished
all
the
aching
pains
and
thoughts
and
consciousness
of
haralal
it
burst
that
bubble
filled
with
the
hot
vapour
of
pain
and
now
there
was
neither
darkness
nor
light
but
only
one
tense
fulness
the
cathedral
clock
struck
one
the
driver
called
out
impatiently
babu
my
horse
ca
go
on
any
longer
where
do
you
want
to
go
there
came
no
answer
the
driver
came
down
and
shook
haralal
and
asked
him
again
where
he
wanted
to
go
there
came
no
answer
and
the
answer
was
never
received
from
haralal
where
he
wanted
to
go
words
to
be
studied
this
word
meant
originally
a
broacher
one
who
broached
or
made
a
hole
in
casks
of
wine
to
test
their
value
for
sale
then
it
came
to
mean
a
middleman
in
a
sale
this
word
comes
from
the
old
french
tourner
meaning
to
turn
the
original
sense
of
the
word
is
one
who
turns
or
transfers
property
and
thus
it
comes
to
mean
one
who
is
appointed
to
do
legal
business
in
the
name
of
another
compare
the
phrase
of
this
comes
from
the
two
words
meaning
death
and
gage
meaning
pledge
a
death
pledge
it
is
used
for
the
transfer
of
property
as
a
pledge
or
guarantee
that
the
debt
will
be
paid
compare
also
compare
from
the
latin
meaning
to
drive
this
latin
root
has
another
form
pel
also
meaning
to
drive
we
have
thus
two
series
of
words
and
noun
this
word
comes
from
the
latin
amicus
friend
and
is
the
same
in
origin
as
amicability
compare
and
this
originally
meant
from
the
latin
sal
meaning
salt
first
it
meant
the
given
to
soldiers
then
it
meant
a
fixed
pay
compare
the
use
of
in
india
which
is
somewhat
similar
this
word
has
come
into
the
english
language
from
a
famous
story
book
called
gulliver
travels
liliput
was
a
place
where
tiny
people
lived
and
brobdingnag
was
a
place
where
giants
lived
these
two
words
are
therefore
sometimes
used
in
an
amusing
manner
to
represent
respectively
the
land
of
dwarfs
and
the
land
of
giants
these
titles
were
originally
used
in
the
old
medieval
universities
of
europe
the
word
bachelor
was
taken
from
its
use
in
chivalry
where
it
meant
a
young
knight
not
yet
fully
qualified
or
equipped
then
came
the
master
or
fully
qualified
person
a
secondary
meaning
of
bachelor
which
is
now
the
most
common
is
an
unmarried
person
a
man
not
being
considered
fully
qualified
or
equipped
till
he
is
married
this
word
has
a
very
interesting
history
the
latin
language
was
the
literary
language
of
the
south
of
europe
for
many
centuries
and
the
vernacular
languages
were
despised
the
word
for
vernacular
was
romanicus
as
contrasted
with
latinus
latin
the
old
folk
stories
of
the
middle
ages
were
written
in
the
vernacular
or
romance
languages
and
as
these
stories
were
strange
and
mysterious
the
word
romance
became
used
for
this
kind
of
literature
from
the
greek
word
pathos
meaning
suffering
compare
from
the
latin
lapis
meaning
a
stone
it
probably
means
to
separate
stone
from
stone
compare
from
the
latin
medius
meaning
middle
compare
from
the
greek
polis
meaning
a
city
compare
from
the
word
bar
there
was
a
bar
in
the
law
court
from
which
the
lawyer
pleaded
his
case
so
the
pleader
was
called
a
compare
the
phrase
called
to
the
bar
from
the
latin
root
meaning
to
stand
compare
a
word
of
doubtful
origin
probably
akin
to
the
word
dazed
from
the
latin
word
res
meaning
a
thing
compare
from
the
latin
alter
meaning
other
compare
from
the
latin
finis
meaning
end
compare
subha
vi
subha
when
the
girl
was
given
the
name
of
subhashini
who
could
have
guessed
that
she
would
prove
dumb
her
two
elder
sisters
were
sukeshini
and
suhasini
and
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
her
father
named
his
youngest
girl
subhashini
she
was
called
subha
for
short
her
two
elder
sisters
had
been
married
with
the
usual
cost
and
difficulty
and
now
the
youngest
daughter
lay
like
a
silent
weight
upon
the
heart
of
her
parents
all
the
world
seemed
to
think
that
because
she
did
not
speak
therefore
she
did
not
feel
it
discussed
her
future
and
its
own
anxiety
freely
in
her
presence
she
had
understood
from
her
earliest
childhood
that
god
had
sent
her
like
a
curse
to
her
house
so
she
withdrew
herself
from
ordinary
people
and
tried
to
live
apart
if
only
they
would
all
forget
her
she
felt
she
could
endure
it
but
who
can
forget
pain
night
and
day
her
parents
minds
were
aching
on
her
account
especially
her
mother
looked
upon
her
as
a
deformity
in
herself
to
a
mother
a
daughter
is
a
more
closely
intimate
part
of
herself
than
a
son
can
be
and
a
fault
in
her
is
a
source
of
personal
shame
banikantha
subha
father
loved
her
rather
better
than
his
other
daughters
her
mother
regarded
her
with
aversion
as
a
stain
upon
her
own
body
if
subha
lacked
speech
she
did
not
lack
a
pair
of
large
dark
eyes
shaded
with
long
lashes
and
her
lips
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
response
to
any
thought
that
rose
in
her
mind
when
we
express
our
thought
in
words
the
medium
is
not
found
easily
there
must
be
a
process
of
translation
which
is
often
inexact
and
then
we
fall
into
error
but
black
eyes
need
no
translating
the
mind
itself
throws
a
shadow
upon
them
in
them
thought
opens
or
shuts
shines
forth
or
goes
out
in
darkness
hangs
steadfast
like
the
setting
moon
or
like
the
swift
and
restless
lightning
illumines
all
quarters
of
the
sky
they
who
from
birth
have
had
no
other
speech
than
the
trembling
of
their
lips
learn
a
language
of
the
eyes
endless
in
expression
deep
as
the
sea
clear
as
the
heavens
wherein
play
dawn
and
sunset
light
and
shadow
the
dumb
have
a
lonely
grandeur
like
nature
own
wherefore
the
other
children
almost
dreaded
subha
and
never
played
with
her
she
was
silent
and
companionless
as
noontide
the
hamlet
where
she
lived
was
chandipur
its
river
small
for
a
river
of
bengal
kept
to
its
narrow
bounds
like
a
daughter
of
the
middle
class
this
busy
streak
of
water
never
overflowed
its
banks
but
went
about
its
duties
as
though
it
were
a
member
of
every
family
in
the
villages
beside
it
on
either
side
were
houses
and
banks
shaded
with
trees
so
stepping
from
her
queenly
throne
the
became
a
garden
deity
of
each
home
and
forgetful
of
herself
performed
her
task
of
endless
benediction
with
swift
and
cheerful
foot
banikantha
house
looked
out
upon
the
stream
every
hut
and
stack
in
the
place
could
be
seen
by
the
passing
boatmen
i
know
not
if
amid
these
signs
of
worldly
wealth
any
one
noticed
the
little
girl
who
when
her
work
was
done
stole
away
to
the
waterside
and
sat
there
but
here
nature
fulfilled
her
want
of
speech
and
spoke
for
her
the
murmur
of
the
brook
the
voice
of
the
village
folk
the
songs
of
the
boatmen
the
crying
of
the
birds
and
rustle
of
trees
mingled
and
were
one
with
the
trembling
of
her
heart
they
became
one
vast
wave
of
sound
which
beat
upon
her
restless
soul
this
murmur
and
movement
of
nature
were
the
dumb
girl
language
that
speech
of
the
dark
eyes
which
the
long
lashes
shaded
was
the
language
of
the
world
about
her
from
the
trees
where
the
cicalas
chirped
to
the
quiet
stars
there
was
nothing
but
signs
and
gestures
weeping
and
sighing
and
in
the
deep
when
the
boatmen
and
had
gone
to
their
dinner
when
the
villagers
slept
and
birds
were
still
when
the
were
idle
when
the
great
busy
world
paused
in
its
toil
and
became
suddenly
a
lonely
awful
giant
then
beneath
the
vast
impressive
heavens
there
were
only
dumb
nature
and
a
dumb
girl
sitting
very
silent
one
under
the
spreading
sunlight
the
other
where
a
small
tree
cast
its
shadow
but
subha
was
not
altogether
without
friends
in
the
stall
were
two
cows
sarbbashi
and
panguli
they
had
never
heard
their
names
from
her
lips
but
they
knew
her
footfall
though
she
had
no
words
she
murmured
lovingly
and
they
understood
her
gentle
murmuring
better
than
all
speech
when
she
fondled
them
or
scolded
or
coaxed
them
they
understood
her
better
than
men
could
do
subha
would
come
to
the
shed
and
throw
her
arms
round
sarbbashi
neck
she
would
rub
her
cheek
against
her
friend
and
panguli
would
turn
her
great
kind
eyes
and
lick
her
face
the
girl
paid
them
three
regular
visits
every
day
and
others
that
were
irregular
whenever
she
heard
any
words
that
hurt
her
she
would
come
to
these
dumb
friends
out
of
due
time
it
was
as
though
they
guessed
her
anguish
of
spirit
from
her
quiet
look
of
sadness
coming
close
to
her
they
would
rub
their
horns
softly
against
her
arms
and
in
dumb
puzzled
fashion
try
to
comfort
her
besides
these
two
there
were
goats
and
a
kitten
but
subha
had
not
the
same
equality
of
friendship
with
them
though
they
showed
the
same
attachment
every
time
it
got
a
chance
night
or
day
the
kitten
would
jump
into
her
lap
and
settle
down
to
slumber
and
show
its
appreciation
of
an
aid
to
sleep
as
subha
drew
her
soft
fingers
over
its
neck
and
back
subha
had
a
comrade
also
among
the
higher
animals
and
it
is
hard
to
say
what
were
the
girl
relations
with
him
for
he
could
speak
and
his
gift
of
speech
left
them
without
any
common
language
he
was
the
youngest
boy
of
the
gosains
pratap
by
name
an
idle
fellow
after
long
effort
his
parents
had
abandoned
the
hope
that
he
would
ever
make
his
living
now
losels
have
this
advantage
that
though
their
own
folk
disapprove
of
them
they
are
generally
popular
with
every
one
else
having
no
work
to
chain
them
they
become
public
property
just
as
every
town
needs
an
open
space
where
all
may
breathe
so
a
village
needs
two
or
three
gentlemen
of
leisure
who
can
give
time
to
all
then
if
we
are
lazy
and
want
a
companion
one
is
to
hand
pratap
chief
ambition
was
to
catch
fish
he
managed
to
waste
a
lot
of
time
this
way
and
might
be
seen
almost
any
afternoon
so
employed
it
was
thus
most
often
that
he
met
subha
whatever
he
was
about
he
liked
a
companion
and
when
one
is
catching
fish
a
silent
companion
is
best
of
all
pratap
respected
subha
for
her
taciturnity
and
as
every
one
called
her
subha
he
showed
his
affection
by
calling
her
su
subha
used
to
sit
beneath
a
tamarind
and
pratap
a
little
distance
off
would
cast
his
line
pratap
took
with
him
a
small
allowance
of
betel
and
subha
prepared
it
for
him
and
i
think
that
sitting
and
gazing
a
long
while
she
desired
ardently
to
bring
some
great
help
to
pratap
to
be
of
real
aid
to
prove
by
any
means
that
she
was
not
a
useless
burden
to
the
world
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
then
she
turned
to
the
creator
in
prayer
for
some
rare
power
that
by
an
astonishing
miracle
she
might
startle
pratap
into
exclaiming
my
i
never
dreamt
our
su
could
have
done
this
only
think
if
subha
had
been
a
water
nymph
she
might
have
risen
slowly
from
the
river
bringing
the
gem
of
a
snake
crown
to
the
then
pratap
leaving
his
paltry
fishing
might
dive
into
the
lower
world
and
see
there
on
a
golden
bed
in
a
palace
of
silver
whom
else
but
dumb
little
su
banikantha
child
yes
our
su
the
only
daughter
of
the
king
of
that
shining
city
of
jewels
but
that
might
not
be
it
was
impossible
not
that
anything
is
really
impossible
but
su
had
been
born
not
into
the
royal
house
of
patalpur
but
into
banikantha
family
and
she
knew
no
means
of
astonishing
the
boy
gradually
she
grew
up
gradually
she
began
to
find
herself
a
new
inexpressible
consciousness
like
a
tide
from
the
central
places
of
the
sea
when
the
moon
is
full
swept
through
her
she
saw
herself
questioned
herself
but
no
answer
came
that
she
could
understand
once
upon
a
time
late
on
a
night
of
full
moon
she
slowly
opened
her
door
and
peeped
out
timidly
nature
herself
at
full
moon
like
lonely
subha
was
looking
down
on
the
sleeping
earth
her
strong
young
life
beat
within
her
joy
and
sadness
filled
her
being
to
its
brim
she
reached
the
limits
even
of
her
own
illimitable
loneliness
nay
passed
beyond
them
her
heart
was
heavy
and
she
could
not
speak
at
the
skirts
of
this
silent
troubled
mother
there
stood
a
silent
troubled
girl
the
thought
of
her
marriage
filled
her
parents
with
an
anxious
care
people
blamed
them
and
even
talked
of
making
them
outcasts
banikantha
was
well
off
they
had
twice
daily
and
consequently
he
did
not
lack
enemies
then
the
women
interfered
and
bani
went
away
for
a
few
days
presently
he
returned
and
said
we
must
go
to
calcutta
they
got
ready
to
go
to
this
strange
country
subha
heart
was
heavy
with
tears
like
a
dawn
with
a
vague
fear
that
had
been
gathering
for
days
she
dogged
her
father
and
mother
like
a
dumb
animal
with
her
large
eyes
wide
open
she
scanned
their
faces
as
though
she
wished
to
learn
something
but
not
a
word
did
they
vouchsafe
one
afternoon
in
the
midst
of
all
this
as
pratap
was
fishing
he
laughed
so
then
su
they
have
caught
your
bridegroom
and
you
are
going
to
be
married
mind
you
do
forget
me
altogether
then
he
turned
his
mind
again
to
his
fish
as
a
stricken
doe
looks
in
the
hunter
face
asking
in
silent
agony
what
have
i
done
to
you
so
subha
looked
at
pratap
that
day
she
sat
no
longer
beneath
her
tree
banikantha
having
finished
his
nap
was
smoking
in
his
bedroom
when
subha
dropped
down
at
his
feet
and
burst
out
weeping
as
she
gazed
towards
him
banikantha
tried
to
comfort
her
and
his
cheek
grew
wet
with
tears
it
was
settled
that
on
the
morrow
they
should
go
to
calcutta
subha
went
to
the
to
bid
farewell
to
her
childhood
comrades
she
fed
them
with
her
hand
she
clasped
their
necks
she
looked
into
their
faces
and
tears
fell
fast
from
the
eyes
which
spoke
for
her
that
night
was
the
tenth
of
the
moon
subha
left
her
room
and
flung
herself
down
on
her
grassy
couch
beside
her
dear
river
it
was
as
if
she
threw
her
arms
about
earth
her
strong
silent
mother
and
tried
to
say
do
not
let
me
leave
you
mother
put
your
arms
about
me
as
i
have
put
mine
about
you
and
hold
me
fast
one
day
in
a
house
in
calcutta
subha
mother
dressed
her
up
with
great
care
she
imprisoned
her
hair
knotting
it
up
in
laces
she
hung
her
about
with
ornaments
and
did
her
best
to
kill
her
natural
beauty
subha
eyes
filled
with
tears
her
mother
fearing
they
would
grow
swollen
with
weeping
scolded
her
harshly
but
the
tears
disregarded
the
scolding
the
bridegroom
came
with
a
friend
to
inspect
the
bride
her
parents
were
dizzy
with
anxiety
and
fear
when
they
saw
the
god
arrive
to
select
the
beast
for
his
sacrifice
behind
the
stage
the
mother
called
her
instructions
aloud
and
increased
her
daughter
weeping
twofold
before
she
sent
her
into
the
examiner
presence
the
great
man
after
scanning
her
a
long
time
observed
not
so
bad
he
took
special
note
of
her
tears
and
thought
she
must
have
a
tender
heart
he
put
it
to
her
credit
in
the
account
arguing
that
the
heart
which
was
distressed
at
leaving
her
parents
would
presently
prove
a
useful
possession
like
the
oyster
pearls
the
child
tears
only
increased
her
value
and
he
made
no
other
comment
the
almanac
was
consulted
and
the
marriage
took
place
on
an
auspicious
day
having
delivered
over
their
dumb
girl
into
another
hands
parents
returned
home
thank
god
their
caste
in
this
and
their
safety
in
the
next
world
were
assured
the
bridegroom
work
lay
in
the
west
and
shortly
after
the
marriage
he
took
his
wife
thither
in
less
than
ten
days
every
one
knew
that
the
bride
was
dumb
at
least
if
any
one
did
not
it
was
not
her
fault
for
she
deceived
no
one
her
eyes
told
them
everything
though
no
one
understood
her
she
looked
on
every
hand
she
found
no
speech
she
missed
the
faces
familiar
from
birth
of
those
who
had
understood
a
dumb
girl
language
in
her
silent
heart
there
sounded
an
endless
voiceless
weeping
which
only
the
searcher
of
hearts
could
hear
words
to
be
studied
from
the
latin
unus
meaning
one
and
forma
meaning
form
compare
the
last
word
occurs
in
the
next
paragraph
of
the
story
the
latin
word
meaning
to
bring
has
two
roots
viz
fer
and
lat
this
word
is
taken
from
the
second
root
we
have
the
two
parallel
series
of
words
in
english
transfer
refer
confer
differ
etc
translate
relate
collate
dilate
etc
this
is
one
of
the
few
words
in
the
english
language
whose
origin
is
doubtful
it
probably
comes
from
the
word
to
pose
which
itself
is
a
shortened
form
of
oppose
meaning
to
set
forward
a
difficult
problem
an
uncommon
english
word
meaning
a
person
who
is
good
for
nothing
the
word
is
derived
from
the
verb
to
lose
the
latin
word
tacitus
means
quiet
or
silent
compare
this
is
used
by
common
people
in
england
it
is
probably
the
short
form
of
my
eye
the
word
in
this
sense
means
to
follow
like
a
dog
to
follow
closely
from
this
we
have
the
adjective
dogged
pronounced
as
two
syllables
meaning
persevering
persistent
never
giving
in
doggéd
courage
from
the
french
garder
or
guarder
meaning
to
keep
this
french
word
appears
in
many
english
forms
compare
this
word
comes
from
an
old
saxon
root
which
has
left
many
words
in
modern
english
compare
from
the
latin
word
capere
meaning
to
take
the
english
verbs
such
as
receive
conceive
perceive
have
come
into
english
from
the
french
the
latin
root
is
more
clearly
seen
in
the
nouns
such
as
deception
reception
perception
etc
it
should
be
carefully
noticed
that
these
french
forms
are
spelt
instead
of
a
simple
rule
is
this
that
after
write
not
but
after
other
consonants
write
compare
the
spelling
of
with
that
of
the
postmaster
vii
the
postmaster
the
postmaster
first
took
up
his
duties
in
the
village
of
ulapur
though
the
village
was
a
small
one
there
was
an
indigo
factory
near
by
and
the
proprietor
an
englishman
had
managed
to
get
a
post
office
established
our
postmaster
belonged
to
calcutta
he
felt
like
a
fish
out
of
water
in
this
remote
village
his
office
and
were
in
a
dark
thatched
shed
not
far
from
a
green
slimy
pond
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
dense
growth
the
men
employed
in
the
indigo
factory
had
no
leisure
moreover
they
were
hardly
desirable
companions
for
decent
folk
nor
is
a
calcutta
boy
an
adept
in
the
art
of
associating
with
others
among
strangers
he
appears
either
proud
or
ill
at
ease
at
any
rate
the
postmaster
had
but
little
company
nor
had
he
much
to
do
at
times
he
tried
his
hand
at
writing
a
verse
or
two
that
the
movement
of
the
leaves
and
the
clouds
of
the
sky
were
enough
to
fill
life
with
joy
such
were
the
sentiments
to
which
he
sought
to
give
expression
but
god
knows
that
the
poor
fellow
would
have
felt
it
as
the
gift
of
a
new
life
if
some
genie
of
the
had
in
one
night
swept
away
the
trees
leaves
and
all
and
replaced
them
with
a
macadamised
road
hiding
the
clouds
from
view
with
rows
of
tall
houses
the
postmaster
salary
was
small
he
had
to
cook
his
own
meals
which
he
used
to
share
with
ratan
an
orphan
girl
of
the
village
who
did
odd
jobs
for
him
when
in
the
evening
the
smoke
began
to
curl
up
from
the
village
cowsheds
and
the
cicalas
chirped
in
every
bush
when
the
mendicants
of
the
baül
sect
sang
their
shrill
songs
in
their
daily
when
any
poet
who
had
attempted
to
watch
the
movement
of
the
leaves
in
the
dense
bamboo
thickets
would
have
felt
a
ghostly
shiver
run
down
his
back
the
postmaster
would
light
his
little
lamp
and
call
out
ratan
ratan
would
sit
outside
waiting
for
this
call
and
instead
of
coming
in
at
once
would
reply
did
you
call
me
sir
what
are
you
doing
the
postmaster
would
ask
i
must
be
going
to
light
the
kitchen
fire
would
be
the
answer
and
the
postmaster
would
say
oh
let
the
kitchen
fire
be
for
awhile
light
me
my
pipe
first
at
last
ratan
would
enter
with
cheeks
vigorously
blowing
into
a
flame
a
live
coal
to
light
the
tobacco
this
would
give
the
postmaster
an
opportunity
of
conversing
well
ratan
perhaps
he
would
begin
do
you
remember
anything
of
your
mother
that
was
a
fertile
subject
ratan
partly
remembered
and
partly
did
her
father
had
been
fonder
of
her
than
her
mother
him
she
recollected
more
vividly
he
used
to
come
home
in
the
evening
after
his
work
and
one
or
two
evenings
stood
out
more
clearly
than
others
like
pictures
in
her
memory
ratan
would
sit
on
the
floor
near
the
postmaster
feet
as
memories
crowded
in
upon
her
she
called
to
mind
a
little
brother
that
she
had
and
how
on
some
bygone
cloudy
day
she
had
played
at
fishing
with
him
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
with
a
twig
for
a
such
little
incidents
would
drive
out
greater
events
from
her
mind
thus
as
they
talked
it
would
often
get
very
late
and
the
postmaster
would
feel
too
lazy
to
do
any
cooking
at
all
ratan
would
then
hastily
light
the
fire
and
toast
some
unleavened
bread
which
with
the
cold
remnants
of
the
morning
meal
was
enough
for
their
supper
on
some
evenings
seated
at
his
desk
in
the
corner
of
the
big
empty
shed
the
postmaster
too
would
call
up
memories
of
his
own
home
of
his
mother
and
his
sister
of
those
for
whom
in
his
exile
his
heart
was
sad
memories
which
were
always
haunting
him
but
which
he
could
not
talk
about
with
the
men
of
the
factory
though
he
found
himself
naturally
recalling
them
aloud
in
the
presence
of
the
simple
little
girl
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
girl
would
allude
to
his
people
as
mother
brother
and
sister
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
in
fact
she
had
a
complete
picture
of
each
one
of
them
painted
in
her
little
heart
one
noon
during
a
break
in
the
rains
there
was
a
cool
soft
breeze
blowing
the
smell
of
the
damp
grass
and
leaves
in
the
hot
sun
felt
like
the
warm
breathing
of
the
tired
earth
on
one
body
a
persistent
bird
went
on
all
the
afternoon
repeating
the
burden
of
its
one
complaint
in
nature
audience
chamber
the
postmaster
had
nothing
to
do
the
shimmer
of
the
freshly
washed
leaves
and
the
remnants
of
the
retreating
were
sights
to
see
and
the
postmaster
was
watching
them
and
thinking
to
himself
oh
if
only
some
kindred
soul
were
near
just
one
loving
human
being
whom
i
could
hold
near
my
heart
this
was
exactly
he
went
on
to
think
what
that
bird
was
trying
to
say
and
it
was
the
same
feeling
which
the
murmuring
leaves
were
striving
to
express
but
no
one
knows
or
would
believe
that
such
an
idea
might
also
take
possession
of
an
village
postmaster
in
the
deep
silent
interval
of
his
work
the
postmaster
sighed
and
called
out
ratan
ratan
was
then
sprawling
beneath
the
busily
engaged
in
eating
unripe
guavas
at
the
voice
of
her
master
she
ran
up
breathlessly
saying
were
you
calling
me
dada
i
was
thinking
said
the
postmaster
of
teaching
you
to
read
and
then
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
taught
her
the
alphabet
thus
in
a
very
short
time
ratan
had
got
as
far
as
the
double
consonants
it
seemed
as
though
the
showers
of
the
season
would
never
end
canals
ditches
and
hollows
were
all
overflowing
with
water
day
and
night
the
patter
of
rain
was
heard
and
the
croaking
of
frogs
the
village
roads
became
impassable
and
marketing
had
to
be
done
in
punts
one
heavily
clouded
morning
the
postmaster
little
pupil
had
been
long
waiting
outside
the
door
for
her
call
but
not
hearing
it
as
usual
she
took
up
her
book
and
slowly
entered
the
room
she
found
her
master
stretched
out
on
his
bed
and
thinking
that
he
was
resting
she
was
about
to
retire
on
when
she
suddenly
heard
her
name
ratan
she
turned
at
once
and
asked
were
you
sleeping
dada
the
postmaster
in
a
plaintive
voice
said
i
am
not
well
feel
my
head
is
it
very
hot
in
the
loneliness
of
his
exile
and
in
the
gloom
of
the
rains
his
ailing
body
needed
a
little
tender
nursing
he
longed
to
remember
the
touch
on
the
forehead
of
soft
hands
with
tinkling
bracelets
to
imagine
the
presence
of
loving
womanhood
the
nearness
of
mother
and
sister
and
the
exile
was
not
disappointed
ratan
ceased
to
be
a
little
girl
she
at
once
stepped
into
the
post
of
mother
called
in
the
village
doctor
gave
the
patient
his
pills
at
the
proper
intervals
sat
up
all
night
by
his
pillow
cooked
his
gruel
for
him
and
every
now
and
then
asked
are
you
feeling
a
little
better
dada
it
was
some
time
before
the
postmaster
with
weakened
body
was
able
to
leave
his
no
more
of
this
said
he
with
decision
i
must
get
a
transfer
he
at
once
wrote
off
to
calcutta
an
application
for
a
transfer
on
the
ground
of
the
unhealthiness
of
the
place
relieved
from
her
duties
as
nurse
ratan
again
took
up
her
old
place
outside
the
door
but
she
no
longer
heard
the
same
old
call
she
would
sometimes
peep
inside
furtively
to
find
the
postmaster
sitting
on
his
chair
or
stretched
on
his
bed
and
staring
into
the
air
while
ratan
was
awaiting
her
call
the
postmaster
was
awaiting
a
reply
to
his
application
the
girl
read
her
old
lessons
over
and
over
again
her
great
fear
was
lest
when
the
call
came
she
might
be
found
wanting
in
the
double
consonants
at
last
after
a
week
the
call
did
come
one
evening
with
an
overflowing
heart
ratan
rushed
into
the
room
with
her
were
you
calling
me
dada
the
postmaster
said
i
am
going
away
ratan
where
are
you
going
dada
i
am
going
home
when
will
you
come
back
i
am
not
coming
back
ratan
asked
no
other
question
the
postmaster
of
his
own
accord
went
on
to
tell
her
that
his
application
for
a
transfer
had
been
rejected
so
he
had
resigned
his
post
and
was
going
home
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
another
word
the
lamp
went
on
dimly
burning
and
from
a
leak
in
one
corner
of
the
thatch
water
dripped
steadily
into
an
earthen
vessel
on
the
floor
beneath
it
after
a
while
ratan
rose
and
went
off
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
the
meal
but
she
was
not
so
quick
about
it
as
on
other
days
many
new
things
to
think
of
had
entered
her
little
brain
when
the
postmaster
had
finished
his
supper
the
girl
suddenly
asked
him
dada
will
you
take
me
to
your
home
the
postmaster
laughed
what
an
idea
said
he
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
explain
to
the
girl
wherein
lay
the
absurdity
that
whole
night
in
her
waking
and
in
her
dreams
the
laughing
reply
haunted
her
what
an
idea
on
getting
up
in
the
morning
the
postmaster
found
his
bath
ready
he
had
stuck
to
his
calcutta
habit
of
bathing
in
water
drawn
and
kept
in
pitchers
instead
of
taking
a
plunge
in
the
river
as
was
the
custom
of
the
village
for
some
reason
or
other
the
girl
could
not
ask
him
about
the
time
of
his
departure
so
she
had
fetched
the
water
from
the
river
long
before
sunrise
that
it
should
be
ready
as
early
as
he
might
want
it
after
the
bath
came
a
call
for
ratan
she
entered
noiselessly
and
looked
silently
into
her
master
face
for
orders
the
master
said
you
need
not
be
anxious
about
my
going
away
ratan
i
shall
tell
my
successor
to
look
after
you
these
words
were
kindly
meant
no
doubt
but
inscrutable
are
the
ways
of
a
woman
heart
ratan
had
borne
many
a
scolding
from
her
master
without
complaint
but
these
kind
words
she
could
not
bear
she
burst
out
weeping
and
said
no
no
you
need
not
tell
anybody
anything
at
all
about
me
i
want
to
stay
on
here
the
postmaster
was
dumbfounded
he
had
never
seen
ratan
like
this
before
the
new
incumbent
duly
arrived
and
the
postmaster
having
given
over
charge
prepared
to
depart
just
before
starting
he
called
ratan
and
said
here
is
something
for
you
i
hope
it
will
keep
you
for
some
little
time
he
brought
out
from
his
pocket
the
whole
of
his
salary
retaining
only
a
trifle
for
his
travelling
expenses
then
ratan
fell
at
his
feet
and
cried
oh
dada
i
pray
you
do
give
me
anything
do
in
any
way
trouble
about
me
and
then
she
ran
away
out
of
sight
the
postmaster
heaved
a
sigh
took
up
his
carpet
bag
put
his
umbrella
over
his
shoulder
and
accompanied
by
a
man
carrying
his
tin
trunk
he
slowly
made
for
the
boat
when
he
got
in
and
the
boat
was
under
way
and
the
river
like
a
stream
of
tears
welling
up
from
the
earth
swirled
and
sobbed
at
her
bows
then
he
felt
a
pain
at
heart
the
face
of
a
village
girl
seemed
to
represent
for
him
the
great
unspoken
pervading
grief
of
mother
earth
herself
at
one
time
he
had
an
impulse
to
go
back
and
bring
away
along
with
him
that
lonesome
waif
forsaken
of
the
world
but
the
wind
had
just
filled
the
sails
the
boat
had
got
well
into
the
middle
of
the
turbulent
current
and
already
the
village
was
left
behind
and
its
outlying
came
in
sight
so
the
traveller
borne
on
the
breast
of
the
river
consoled
himself
with
philosophical
reflections
on
the
numberless
meetings
and
partings
going
on
in
the
world
on
death
the
great
parting
from
which
none
returns
but
ratan
had
no
philosophy
she
was
wandering
about
the
post
office
in
a
flood
of
tears
it
may
be
that
she
had
still
a
lurking
hope
in
some
corner
of
her
heart
that
her
dada
would
return
and
that
is
why
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
alas
for
our
foolish
human
nature
its
fond
mistakes
are
persistent
the
dictates
of
reason
take
a
long
time
to
assert
their
own
sway
the
surest
proofs
meanwhile
are
disbelieved
false
hope
is
clung
to
with
all
one
might
and
main
till
a
day
comes
when
it
has
sucked
the
heart
dry
and
it
forcibly
breaks
through
its
bonds
and
departs
after
that
comes
the
misery
of
awakening
and
then
once
again
the
longing
to
get
back
into
the
maze
of
the
same
mistakes
words
to
be
studied
this
word
has
a
very
interesting
history
it
means
indian
the
celebrated
dye
came
from
india
this
dye
was
first
known
to
the
greeks
who
called
it
indikon
then
to
the
latins
who
called
it
indicum
then
to
the
italians
and
spaniards
who
called
it
indigo
it
was
introduced
into
england
from
italy
by
artists
and
painters
who
kept
the
italian
word
indigo
without
change
there
is
a
latin
word
genius
meaning
originally
a
spirit
inhabiting
a
special
place
it
is
from
this
word
that
our
english
common
noun
genius
is
taken
meaning
a
specially
gifted
or
inspired
person
a
man
of
genius
but
in
the
arabian
nights
a
completely
different
arabic
word
is
found
viz
jinn
with
its
feminine
form
jinni
this
was
written
in
english
genie
and
was
confused
with
the
word
genius
the
plural
of
genie
when
used
in
this
sense
is
genii
which
is
really
the
plural
of
the
latin
word
genius
this
is
quite
a
modern
word
in
english
it
comes
from
the
name
of
the
inventor
of
this
kind
of
who
was
macadam
he
discovered
that
different
layers
of
small
stone
rolled
in
one
after
the
other
can
stand
the
wear
and
tear
of
traffic
we
have
similar
words
from
proper
names
compare
etc
from
the
latin
ludere
to
play
compare
this
word
came
into
english
from
the
spanish
it
is
of
great
interest
to
trace
the
names
of
the
fruits
in
english
back
to
their
sources
comes
from
corinth
from
the
portuguese
from
the
tamil
mankay
from
the
arabic
narang
and
hindustani
narangi
from
arabic
from
the
greek
daktulos
meaning
finger
the
two
first
letters
in
the
greek
language
are
called
alpha
and
beta
then
the
whole
series
of
letters
was
named
an
alphabeta
or
alphabet
from
the
latin
sonare
meaning
to
sound
consonants
are
letters
which
sound
with
the
vowels
compare
this
is
one
example
of
a
word
taken
into
english
from
the
latin
through
the
french
having
a
companion
word
in
english
the
companion
word
in
this
case
is
compare
and
and
and
this
word
has
come
into
the
english
language
from
common
speech
it
is
a
mixture
of
the
english
word
dumb
and
the
latin
fundere
to
pour
which
we
find
in
it
is
not
often
that
we
get
such
hybrid
words
in
earlier
english
though
they
are
becoming
common
in
the
case
of
new
words
such
as
etc
the
old
rule
used
to
be
that
a
compound
word
in
english
should
have
its
parts
from
the
same
language
both
parts
latin
or
greek
or
saxon
but
this
rule
is
rapidly
breaking
down
in
common
practice
as
new
words
rush
into
the
english
language
to
express
all
the
new
discoveries
of
science
we
have
english
and
greek
roots
mixed
such
as
and
latin
and
greek
roots
mixed
such
as
the
castaway
viii
the
castaway
towards
evening
the
storm
was
at
its
height
from
the
terrific
downpour
of
rain
the
crash
of
thunder
and
the
repeated
flashes
of
lightning
you
might
think
that
a
battle
of
the
gods
and
demons
was
raging
in
the
skies
black
clouds
waved
like
the
flags
of
doom
the
ganges
was
lashed
into
a
fury
and
the
trees
of
the
gardens
on
either
bank
swayed
from
side
to
side
with
sighs
and
groans
in
a
closed
room
of
one
of
the
riverside
houses
at
chandernagore
a
husband
and
his
wife
were
seated
on
a
bed
spread
on
the
floor
intently
discussing
an
earthen
lamp
burned
beside
them
the
husband
sharat
was
saying
i
wish
you
would
stay
on
a
few
days
more
you
would
then
be
able
to
return
home
quite
strong
again
the
wife
kiran
was
saying
i
have
quite
recovered
already
it
will
not
can
not
possibly
do
me
any
harm
to
go
home
now
every
married
person
will
at
once
understand
that
the
conversation
was
not
quite
so
brief
as
i
have
reported
it
the
matter
was
not
difficult
but
the
arguments
for
and
against
did
not
advance
it
towards
a
solution
like
a
rudderless
boat
the
discussion
kept
turning
round
and
round
the
same
point
and
at
last
threatened
to
be
overwhelmed
in
a
flood
of
tears
sharat
said
the
doctor
thinks
you
should
stop
here
a
few
days
longer
kiran
replied
your
doctor
knows
everything
well
said
sharat
you
know
that
just
now
all
sorts
of
illnesses
are
abroad
you
would
do
well
to
stop
here
a
month
or
two
more
and
at
this
moment
i
suppose
every
one
in
this
place
is
perfectly
well
what
had
happened
was
this
kiran
was
a
universal
favourite
with
her
family
and
neighbours
so
that
when
she
fell
seriously
ill
they
were
all
anxious
the
village
wiseacres
thought
it
shameless
for
her
husband
to
make
so
much
fuss
about
a
mere
wife
and
even
to
suggest
a
change
of
air
and
asked
if
sharat
supposed
that
no
woman
had
ever
been
ill
before
or
whether
he
had
found
out
that
the
folk
of
the
place
to
which
he
meant
to
take
her
were
immortal
did
he
imagine
that
the
writ
of
fate
did
not
run
there
but
sharat
and
his
mother
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
them
thinking
that
the
little
life
of
their
darling
was
of
greater
importance
than
the
united
wisdom
of
a
village
people
are
wont
to
reason
thus
when
danger
threatens
their
loved
ones
so
sharat
went
to
chandernagore
and
kiran
recovered
though
she
was
still
very
weak
there
was
a
pinched
look
on
her
face
which
filled
the
beholder
with
pity
and
made
his
heart
tremble
as
he
thought
how
narrowly
she
had
escaped
death
kiran
was
fond
of
society
and
amusement
the
loneliness
of
her
riverside
villa
did
not
suit
her
at
all
there
was
nothing
to
do
there
were
no
interesting
neighbours
and
she
hated
to
be
busy
all
day
with
medicine
and
dieting
there
was
no
fun
in
measuring
doses
and
making
fomentations
such
was
the
subject
discussed
in
their
closed
room
on
this
stormy
evening
so
long
as
kiran
deigned
to
argue
there
was
a
chance
of
a
fair
fight
when
she
ceased
to
reply
and
with
a
toss
of
her
head
disconsolately
looked
the
other
way
the
poor
man
was
disarmed
he
was
on
the
point
of
surrendering
unconditionally
when
a
servant
shouted
a
message
through
the
shut
door
sharat
got
up
and
on
opening
the
door
learnt
that
a
boat
had
been
upset
in
the
storm
and
that
one
of
the
occupants
a
young
brahmin
boy
had
succeeded
in
swimming
ashore
at
their
garden
kiran
was
at
once
her
own
sweet
self
and
set
to
work
to
get
out
some
dry
clothes
for
the
boy
she
then
warmed
a
cup
of
milk
and
invited
him
to
her
room
the
boy
had
long
curly
hair
big
expressive
eyes
and
no
sign
yet
of
hair
on
the
face
kiran
after
getting
him
to
drink
some
milk
asked
him
all
about
himself
he
told
her
that
his
name
was
nilkanta
and
that
he
belonged
to
a
theatrical
troupe
they
were
coming
to
play
in
a
neighbouring
villa
when
the
boat
had
suddenly
foundered
in
the
storm
he
had
no
idea
what
had
become
of
his
companions
he
was
a
good
swimmer
and
had
just
managed
to
reach
the
shore
the
boy
stayed
with
them
his
narrow
escape
from
a
terrible
death
made
kiran
take
a
warm
interest
in
him
sharat
thought
the
boy
appearance
at
this
moment
rather
a
good
thing
as
his
wife
would
now
have
something
to
amuse
her
and
might
be
persuaded
to
stay
on
for
some
time
longer
her
too
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
profiting
their
brahmin
guest
by
her
kindness
and
nilkanta
himself
was
delighted
at
his
double
escape
from
his
master
and
from
the
other
world
as
well
as
at
finding
a
home
in
this
wealthy
family
but
in
a
short
while
sharat
and
his
mother
changed
their
opinion
and
longed
for
his
departure
the
boy
found
a
secret
pleasure
in
smoking
sharat
hookahs
he
would
calmly
go
off
in
pouring
rain
with
best
silk
umbrella
for
a
stroll
through
the
village
and
make
friends
with
all
whom
he
met
moreover
he
had
got
hold
of
a
mongrel
village
dog
which
he
petted
so
recklessly
that
it
came
indoors
with
muddy
paws
and
left
tokens
of
its
visit
on
sharat
spotless
bed
then
he
gathered
about
him
a
devoted
band
of
boys
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
and
the
result
was
that
not
a
solitary
mango
in
the
neighbourhood
had
a
chance
of
ripening
that
season
there
is
no
doubt
that
kiran
had
a
hand
in
spoiling
the
boy
sharat
often
warned
her
about
it
but
she
would
not
listen
to
him
she
made
a
dandy
of
him
with
sharat
clothes
and
gave
him
new
ones
also
and
because
she
felt
drawn
towards
him
and
had
a
curiosity
to
know
more
about
him
she
was
constantly
calling
him
to
her
own
room
after
her
bath
and
midday
meal
kiran
would
be
seated
on
the
bedstead
with
her
box
by
her
side
and
while
her
maid
combed
and
dried
her
hair
nilkanta
would
stand
in
front
and
recite
pieces
out
of
his
repertory
with
appropriate
gesture
and
song
his
waving
wildly
thus
the
long
afternoon
hours
passed
merrily
away
kiran
would
often
try
to
persuade
sharat
to
sit
with
her
as
one
of
the
audience
but
sharat
who
had
taken
a
cordial
dislike
to
the
boy
refused
nor
could
nilkanta
do
his
part
half
so
well
when
sharat
was
there
his
mother
would
sometimes
be
lured
by
the
hope
of
hearing
sacred
names
in
the
recitation
but
love
of
her
sleep
speedily
overcame
devotion
and
she
lay
lapped
in
dreams
the
boy
often
got
his
ears
boxed
and
pulled
by
sharat
but
as
this
was
nothing
to
what
he
had
been
used
to
as
a
member
of
the
troupe
he
did
not
mind
it
in
the
least
in
his
short
experience
of
the
world
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
as
the
earth
consisted
of
land
and
water
so
human
life
was
made
up
of
eatings
and
beatings
and
that
the
beatings
largely
predominated
it
was
hard
to
tell
nilkanta
age
if
it
was
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
then
his
face
was
too
old
for
his
years
if
seventeen
or
eighteen
then
it
was
too
young
he
was
either
a
man
too
early
or
a
boy
too
late
the
fact
was
that
joining
the
theatrical
band
when
very
young
he
had
played
the
parts
of
radhika
damayanti
and
sita
and
a
thoughtful
providence
so
arranged
things
that
he
grew
to
the
exact
stature
that
his
manager
required
and
then
growth
ceased
since
every
one
saw
how
small
nilkanta
was
and
he
himself
felt
small
he
did
not
receive
due
respect
for
his
years
causes
natural
and
artificial
combined
to
make
him
sometimes
seem
immature
for
seventeen
years
and
at
other
times
a
mere
lad
of
fourteen
but
far
too
knowing
even
for
seventeen
and
as
no
sign
of
hair
appeared
on
his
face
the
confusion
became
greater
either
because
he
smoked
or
because
he
used
language
beyond
his
years
his
lips
puckered
into
lines
that
showed
him
to
be
old
and
hard
but
innocence
and
youth
shone
in
his
large
eyes
i
fancy
that
his
heart
remained
young
but
the
hot
glare
of
publicity
had
been
a
that
ripened
untimely
his
outward
aspect
in
the
quiet
shelter
of
sharat
house
and
garden
at
chandernagore
nature
had
leisure
to
work
her
way
unimpeded
nilkanta
had
lingered
in
a
kind
of
unnatural
youth
but
now
he
silently
and
swiftly
overpassed
that
stage
his
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
came
to
adequate
revelation
no
one
observed
the
change
and
its
first
sign
was
this
that
when
kiran
treated
him
like
a
boy
he
felt
ashamed
when
the
gay
kiran
one
day
proposed
that
he
should
play
the
part
of
lady
companion
the
idea
of
woman
dress
hurt
him
though
he
could
not
say
why
so
now
when
she
called
for
him
to
act
over
again
his
old
characters
he
disappeared
it
never
occurred
to
nilkanta
that
he
was
even
now
not
much
more
than
a
in
a
strolling
company
he
even
made
up
his
mind
to
pick
up
a
little
education
from
sharat
factor
but
because
he
was
the
pet
of
his
master
wife
the
factor
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
him
also
his
restless
training
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
keep
his
mind
long
engaged
sooner
or
later
the
alphabet
did
a
misty
dance
before
his
eyes
he
would
sit
long
enough
with
an
open
book
on
his
lap
leaning
against
a
bush
beside
the
ganges
the
waves
sighed
below
boats
floated
past
birds
flitted
and
twittered
restlessly
above
what
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
as
he
looked
down
on
that
book
he
alone
knew
if
indeed
he
did
know
he
never
advanced
from
one
word
to
another
but
the
glorious
thought
that
he
was
actually
reading
a
book
filled
his
soul
with
exultation
whenever
a
boat
went
by
he
lifted
his
book
and
pretended
to
be
reading
hard
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
but
his
energy
dropped
as
soon
as
the
audience
was
gone
formerly
he
sang
his
songs
automatically
but
now
their
tunes
stirred
in
his
mind
their
words
were
of
little
import
and
full
of
trifling
alliteration
even
the
feeble
meaning
they
had
was
beyond
his
comprehension
yet
when
he
sang
bird
ah
wherefore
stirred
to
wrong
our
royal
lady
goose
ah
say
why
wilt
thou
slay
her
in
forest
shady
then
he
felt
as
if
transported
to
another
world
and
to
fear
other
folk
this
familiar
earth
and
his
own
poor
life
became
music
and
he
was
transformed
that
tale
of
the
goose
and
the
king
daughter
flung
upon
the
mirror
of
his
mind
a
picture
of
surpassing
beauty
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
he
imagined
himself
to
be
but
the
destitute
little
slave
of
the
theatrical
troupe
faded
from
his
memory
when
with
evening
the
child
of
want
lies
down
dirty
and
hungry
in
his
squalid
home
and
hears
of
prince
and
princess
and
fabled
gold
then
in
the
dark
hovel
with
its
dim
flickering
candle
his
mind
springs
free
from
its
bonds
of
poverty
and
misery
and
walks
in
fresh
beauty
and
glowing
raiment
strong
beyond
all
fear
of
hindrance
through
that
fairy
realm
where
all
is
possible
even
so
this
drudge
of
wandering
players
fashioned
himself
and
his
world
anew
as
he
moved
in
spirit
amid
his
songs
the
lapping
water
rustling
leaves
and
calling
birds
the
goddess
who
had
given
shelter
to
him
the
helpless
the
her
gracious
lovely
face
her
exquisite
arms
with
their
shining
bangles
her
rosy
feet
as
soft
as
all
these
by
some
magic
became
one
with
the
music
of
his
song
when
the
singing
ended
the
mirage
faded
and
the
nilkanta
of
the
stage
appeared
again
with
his
wild
fresh
from
the
complaints
of
his
neighbour
the
owner
of
the
despoiled
sharat
would
come
and
box
his
ears
and
cuff
him
the
boy
nilkanta
the
misleader
of
adoring
youths
went
forth
once
more
to
make
ever
new
mischief
by
land
and
water
and
in
the
branches
that
are
above
the
earth
shortly
after
the
advent
of
nilkanta
sharat
younger
brother
satish
came
to
spend
his
college
vacation
with
them
kiran
was
hugely
pleased
at
finding
a
fresh
occupation
she
and
satish
were
of
the
same
age
and
the
time
passed
pleasantly
in
games
and
quarrels
and
reconciliations
and
laughter
and
even
tears
suddenly
she
would
clasp
him
over
the
eyes
from
behind
with
hands
or
she
would
write
monkey
on
his
back
or
else
she
would
bolt
the
door
on
him
from
the
outside
amidst
peals
of
laughter
satish
in
his
turn
did
not
take
things
lying
down
he
would
steal
her
keys
and
rings
he
would
put
pepper
among
her
betel
he
would
tie
her
to
the
bed
when
she
was
not
looking
meanwhile
heaven
only
knows
what
possessed
poor
nilkanta
he
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
bitterness
which
he
must
avenge
on
somebody
or
something
he
thrashed
his
devoted
for
no
fault
and
sent
them
away
crying
he
would
kick
his
pet
mongrel
till
it
made
the
skies
resound
with
its
whinings
when
he
went
out
for
a
walk
he
would
litter
his
path
with
twigs
and
leaves
beaten
from
the
roadside
shrubs
with
his
cane
kiran
liked
to
see
people
enjoying
good
fare
nilkanta
had
an
immense
capacity
for
eating
and
never
refused
a
good
thing
however
often
it
was
offered
so
kiran
liked
to
send
for
him
to
have
his
meals
in
her
presence
and
ply
him
with
delicacies
happy
in
the
bliss
of
seeing
this
brahmin
boy
eat
to
satiety
after
satish
arrival
she
had
much
less
spare
time
on
her
hands
and
was
seldom
present
when
nilkanta
meals
were
served
before
her
absence
made
no
difference
to
the
appetite
and
he
would
not
rise
till
he
had
drained
his
cup
of
milk
and
rinsed
it
thoroughly
with
water
but
now
if
kiran
was
not
present
to
ask
him
to
try
this
and
that
he
was
miserable
and
nothing
tasted
right
he
would
get
up
without
eating
much
and
say
to
the
in
a
choking
voice
i
am
not
hungry
he
thought
in
imagination
that
the
news
of
his
repeated
refusal
i
am
not
hungry
would
reach
kiran
he
pictured
her
concern
and
hoped
that
she
would
send
for
him
and
press
him
to
eat
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
kiran
never
knew
and
never
sent
for
him
and
the
maid
finished
whatever
he
left
he
would
then
put
out
the
lamp
in
his
room
and
throw
himself
on
his
bed
in
the
darkness
burying
his
head
in
the
pillow
in
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
what
was
his
grievance
against
whom
and
from
whom
did
he
expect
redress
at
last
when
no
one
else
came
mother
sleep
soothed
with
her
soft
caresses
the
wounded
heart
of
the
motherless
lad
nilkanta
came
to
the
unshakable
conviction
that
satish
was
poisoning
kiran
mind
against
him
if
kiran
was
and
had
not
her
usual
smile
he
would
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
some
trick
of
satish
had
made
her
angry
with
him
he
took
to
praying
to
the
gods
with
all
the
fervour
of
his
hate
to
make
him
at
the
next
rebirth
satish
and
satish
him
he
had
an
idea
that
a
brahmin
wrath
could
never
be
in
vain
and
the
more
he
tried
to
consume
satish
with
the
fire
of
his
curses
the
more
did
his
own
heart
burn
within
him
and
upstairs
he
would
hear
satish
laughing
and
joking
with
his
nilkanta
never
dared
openly
to
show
his
enmity
to
satish
but
he
would
contrive
a
hundred
petty
ways
of
causing
him
annoyance
when
satish
went
for
a
swim
in
the
river
and
left
his
soap
on
the
steps
of
the
on
coming
back
for
it
he
would
find
that
it
had
disappeared
once
he
found
his
favourite
striped
tunic
floating
past
him
on
the
water
and
thought
it
had
been
blown
away
by
the
wind
one
day
kiran
desiring
to
entertain
satish
sent
for
nilkanta
to
recite
as
usual
but
he
stood
there
in
gloomy
silence
quite
surprised
kiran
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
but
he
remained
silent
and
when
again
pressed
by
her
to
repeat
some
particular
favourite
piece
of
hers
he
answered
i
do
remember
and
walked
away
at
last
the
time
came
for
their
return
home
everybody
was
busy
packing
up
satish
was
going
with
them
but
to
nilkanta
nobody
said
a
word
the
question
whether
he
was
to
go
or
not
seemed
to
have
occurred
to
nobody
the
subject
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
been
raised
by
kiran
who
had
proposed
to
take
him
along
with
them
but
her
husband
and
his
mother
and
brother
had
all
objected
so
strenuously
that
she
let
the
matter
drop
a
couple
of
days
before
they
were
to
start
she
sent
for
the
boy
and
with
kind
words
advised
him
to
go
back
to
his
own
home
so
many
days
had
he
felt
neglected
that
this
touch
of
kindness
was
too
much
for
him
he
burst
into
tears
kiran
eyes
were
also
brimming
over
she
was
filled
with
remorse
at
the
thought
that
she
had
created
a
tie
of
affection
which
could
not
be
permanent
but
satish
was
much
annoyed
at
the
blubbering
of
this
overgrown
boy
why
does
the
fool
stand
there
howling
instead
of
speaking
said
he
when
kiran
scolded
him
for
an
unfeeling
creature
he
replied
my
dear
sister
you
do
not
understand
you
are
too
good
and
trustful
this
fellow
turns
up
from
the
lord
knows
where
and
is
treated
like
a
king
naturally
the
tiger
has
no
wish
to
become
a
mouse
again
and
he
has
evidently
discovered
that
there
is
nothing
like
a
tear
or
two
to
soften
your
heart
nilkanta
hurriedly
left
the
spot
he
felt
he
would
like
to
be
a
knife
to
cut
satish
to
pieces
a
needle
to
pierce
him
through
and
through
a
fire
to
burn
him
to
ashes
but
satish
was
not
even
scared
it
was
only
his
own
heart
that
bled
and
bled
satish
had
brought
with
him
from
calcutta
a
grand
inkstand
the
inkpot
was
set
in
a
boat
drawn
by
a
goose
supporting
a
penholder
it
was
a
great
favourite
of
his
and
he
cleaned
it
carefully
every
day
with
an
old
silk
handkerchief
kiran
would
laugh
and
tapping
the
silver
bird
beak
would
say
bird
ah
wherefore
stirred
to
wrong
our
royal
lady
and
the
usual
war
of
words
would
break
out
between
her
and
her
the
day
before
they
were
to
start
the
inkstand
was
missing
and
could
nowhere
be
found
kiran
smiled
and
said
your
goose
has
flown
off
to
look
for
your
damayanti
but
satish
was
in
a
great
rage
he
was
certain
that
nilkanta
had
stolen
it
for
several
people
said
they
had
seen
him
prowling
about
the
room
the
night
before
he
had
the
accused
brought
before
him
kiran
also
was
there
you
have
stolen
my
inkstand
you
thief
he
blurted
out
bring
it
back
at
once
nilkanta
had
always
taken
punishment
from
sharat
deserved
or
undeserved
with
perfect
equanimity
but
when
he
was
called
a
thief
in
kiran
presence
his
eyes
blazed
with
a
fierce
anger
his
breast
swelled
and
his
throat
choked
if
satish
had
said
another
word
he
would
have
flown
at
him
like
a
wild
cat
and
used
his
nails
like
claws
kiran
was
greatly
distressed
at
the
scene
and
taking
the
boy
into
another
room
said
in
her
sweet
kind
way
nilu
if
you
really
have
taken
that
inkstand
give
it
to
me
quietly
and
i
shall
see
that
no
one
says
another
word
to
you
about
it
big
tears
coursed
down
the
cheeks
till
at
last
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
kiran
came
back
from
the
room
and
said
i
am
sure
nilkanta
has
not
taken
the
inkstand
sharat
and
satish
were
equally
positive
that
no
other
than
nilkanta
could
have
done
it
but
kiran
said
determinedly
never
sharat
wanted
to
the
boy
but
his
wife
refused
to
allow
it
then
satish
suggested
that
his
room
and
box
should
be
searched
and
kiran
said
if
you
dare
do
such
a
thing
i
will
never
forgive
you
you
shall
not
spy
on
the
poor
innocent
boy
and
as
she
spoke
her
wonderful
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
settled
the
matter
and
effectually
prevented
any
further
molestation
of
nilkanta
kiran
heart
overflowed
with
pity
at
this
attempted
outrage
on
a
homeless
lad
she
got
two
new
suits
of
clothes
and
a
pair
of
shoes
and
with
these
and
a
banknote
in
her
hand
she
quietly
went
into
room
in
the
evening
she
intended
to
put
these
parting
presents
into
his
box
as
a
surprise
the
box
itself
had
been
her
gift
from
her
bunch
of
keys
she
selected
one
that
fitted
and
noiselessly
opened
the
box
it
was
so
jumbled
up
with
odds
and
ends
that
the
new
clothes
would
not
go
in
so
she
thought
she
had
better
take
everything
out
and
pack
the
box
for
him
at
first
knives
tops
reels
bamboo
twigs
polished
shells
for
peeling
green
mangoes
bottoms
of
broken
tumblers
and
such
like
things
dear
to
a
boy
heart
were
discovered
then
there
came
a
layer
of
linen
clean
and
otherwise
and
from
under
the
linen
there
emerged
the
missing
inkstand
goose
and
all
kiran
with
flushed
face
sat
down
helplessly
with
the
inkstand
in
her
hand
puzzled
and
wondering
in
the
meantime
nilkanta
had
come
into
the
room
from
behind
without
kiran
knowing
it
he
had
seen
the
whole
thing
and
thought
that
kiran
had
come
like
a
thief
to
catch
him
in
his
thieving
and
that
his
deed
was
out
how
could
he
ever
hope
to
convince
her
that
he
was
not
a
thief
and
that
only
revenge
had
prompted
him
to
take
the
inkstand
which
he
meant
to
throw
into
the
river
at
the
first
chance
in
a
weak
moment
he
had
put
it
in
the
box
instead
he
was
not
a
thief
his
heart
cried
out
not
a
thief
then
what
was
he
what
could
he
say
that
he
had
stolen
and
yet
he
was
not
a
thief
he
could
never
explain
to
kiran
how
grievously
wrong
she
was
and
then
how
could
he
bear
the
thought
that
she
had
tried
to
spy
on
him
at
last
kiran
with
a
deep
sigh
replaced
the
inkstand
in
the
box
and
as
if
she
were
the
thief
herself
covered
it
up
with
the
linen
and
the
trinkets
as
they
were
before
and
at
the
top
she
placed
the
presents
together
with
the
banknote
which
she
had
brought
for
him
the
next
day
the
boy
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
villagers
had
not
seen
him
the
police
could
discover
no
trace
of
him
said
sharat
now
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
let
us
have
a
look
at
his
box
but
kiran
was
obstinate
in
her
refusal
to
allow
that
to
be
done
she
had
the
box
brought
up
to
her
own
room
and
taking
out
the
inkstand
alone
she
threw
it
into
the
river
the
whole
family
went
home
in
a
day
the
garden
became
desolate
and
only
that
starving
mongrel
of
nilkanta
remained
prowling
along
the
whining
and
whining
as
if
its
heart
would
break
words
to
be
studied
a
certain
number
of
words
such
as
have
come
into
english
through
the
french
from
the
latin
there
is
a
constant
tendency
in
modern
english
to
leave
out
the
letter
u
and
spell
etc
but
this
movement
has
not
yet
gained
much
ground
in
england
this
form
originally
comes
from
the
dutch
the
ending
acres
is
a
corruption
of
the
dutch
seggen
which
is
the
same
as
the
english
to
say
the
word
is
equivalent
to
this
is
a
word
which
comes
through
the
french
from
the
latin
dignus
meaning
worthy
compare
an
example
of
two
words
with
slightly
different
meanings
coming
from
one
and
the
same
french
word
the
french
word
is
troupe
meaning
a
company
this
form
is
used
in
english
for
a
company
of
players
or
actors
but
the
form
troop
is
used
chiefly
of
soldiers
this
is
a
modern
english
word
from
the
greek
autos
meaning
self
compare
modern
english
is
drawing
largely
from
the
greek
language
for
its
new
words
the
latin
word
for
letter
is
littera
from
this
we
get
many
english
words
etc
from
the
latin
mirari
to
wonder
compare
this
is
one
of
the
words
in
english
which
keeps
the
old
french
accent
on
the
last
syllable
miráge
the
tendency
in
english
is
always
to
throw
the
accent
back
as
far
as
possible
many
words
have
changed
their
pronunciation
in
the
course
of
time
obdurate
in
milton
time
was
pronounced
obdúrate
but
it
is
pronounced
óbdurate
trafalgar
was
pronounced
trafalgár
last
century
now
we
pronounce
it
trafálgar
the
son
of
rashmani
ix
the
son
of
rashmani
i
kalipada
mother
was
rashmani
but
she
had
to
do
the
duty
of
the
father
as
well
because
when
both
of
the
parents
are
mother
then
it
is
bad
for
the
child
bhavani
her
husband
was
wholly
incapable
of
keeping
his
children
under
discipline
to
know
why
he
was
bent
on
spoiling
his
son
you
must
hear
something
of
the
former
history
of
the
family
bhavani
was
born
in
the
famous
house
of
saniari
his
father
abhaya
charan
had
a
son
shyama
charan
by
his
first
wife
when
he
married
again
after
her
death
he
had
himself
passed
the
marriageable
age
and
his
new
took
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
his
position
to
have
a
special
portion
of
his
estate
settled
on
his
daughter
in
this
way
he
was
satisfied
that
proper
provision
had
been
made
if
his
daughter
should
become
a
widow
early
in
life
she
would
be
independent
of
the
charity
of
shyama
charan
the
first
part
of
his
anticipation
came
true
for
very
soon
after
the
birth
of
a
son
whom
she
called
bhavani
abhaya
charan
died
it
gave
the
great
peace
and
consolation
as
he
looked
forward
to
his
own
death
to
know
that
his
daughter
was
properly
looked
after
shyama
charan
was
quite
grown
up
in
fact
his
own
eldest
boy
was
a
year
older
than
bhavani
he
brought
up
the
latter
with
his
own
son
in
doing
this
he
never
took
a
farthing
from
the
property
allotted
to
his
and
every
year
he
got
a
receipt
from
her
after
submitting
detailed
accounts
his
honesty
in
this
affair
surprised
the
neighbourhood
in
fact
they
thought
that
such
honesty
was
another
name
for
foolishness
they
did
not
like
the
idea
of
a
division
being
made
in
the
undivided
ancestral
property
if
shyama
charan
in
some
underhand
manner
had
been
able
to
annul
the
dowry
his
neighbours
would
have
admired
his
sagacity
and
there
were
good
advisers
ready
to
hand
who
could
have
rendered
him
material
aid
in
the
attainment
of
such
an
object
but
shyama
charan
in
spite
of
the
risk
of
crippling
his
patrimony
strictly
set
aside
the
dowry
which
came
to
the
share
of
his
and
the
widow
vraja
sundari
being
naturally
affectionate
and
trustful
had
every
confidence
in
shyama
charan
whom
she
trusted
as
her
own
son
more
than
once
she
had
chided
him
for
being
so
particular
about
her
portion
of
the
property
she
would
tell
him
that
as
she
was
not
going
to
take
her
property
with
her
when
she
died
and
as
it
would
in
any
case
revert
to
the
family
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
so
very
strict
about
rendering
accounts
but
he
never
listened
to
her
shyama
charan
was
a
severe
disciplinarian
by
habit
and
his
children
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
but
bhavani
had
every
possible
freedom
and
this
gave
rise
to
the
impression
that
he
was
more
partial
to
his
than
to
his
own
sons
but
bhavani
education
was
sadly
neglected
and
he
completely
relied
on
shyama
charan
for
the
management
of
his
share
of
the
property
he
merely
had
to
sign
documents
occasionally
without
ever
spending
a
thought
on
their
contents
on
the
other
hand
tarapada
the
eldest
son
of
shyama
charan
was
quite
an
expert
in
the
management
of
the
estate
having
to
act
as
an
assistant
to
his
father
after
the
death
of
shyama
charan
tarapada
said
to
bhavani
uncle
we
must
not
live
together
as
we
have
done
for
so
long
because
some
trifling
misunderstanding
may
come
at
any
moment
and
cause
utter
disruption
bhavani
never
imagined
even
in
his
dream
that
a
day
might
come
when
he
would
have
to
manage
his
own
affairs
the
world
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
ever
appeared
to
him
complete
and
entire
in
itself
it
was
an
incomprehensible
calamity
to
him
that
there
could
be
a
dividing
line
somewhere
and
that
this
world
of
his
could
be
split
into
two
when
he
found
that
tarapada
was
immovable
and
indifferent
to
the
grief
and
dishonour
that
such
a
step
would
bring
to
the
family
he
began
to
rack
his
brain
to
find
out
how
the
property
could
be
divided
with
the
least
possible
strain
tarapada
showed
surprise
at
his
uncle
anxiety
and
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
about
this
because
the
division
had
already
been
made
in
the
of
his
grandfather
bhavani
said
in
amazement
but
i
know
nothing
of
this
tarapada
said
in
answer
then
you
must
be
the
only
one
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
who
does
not
for
lest
there
should
be
ruinous
litigation
after
he
had
gone
my
grandfather
had
already
given
a
portion
of
the
property
to
your
mother
bhavani
thought
this
not
unlikely
and
asked
what
about
the
house
tarapada
said
if
you
wish
you
can
keep
this
house
to
yourself
and
we
shall
be
contented
with
the
other
house
in
the
district
town
as
bhavani
had
never
been
to
this
he
had
neither
knowledge
of
it
nor
affection
for
it
he
was
astounded
at
the
magnanimity
of
tarapada
for
so
easily
relinquishing
his
right
to
the
house
in
the
village
where
they
had
been
brought
up
but
when
bhavani
told
everything
to
his
mother
she
struck
her
forehead
with
her
hand
and
said
this
is
preposterous
what
i
got
from
my
husband
was
my
own
dowry
and
its
income
is
very
small
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
be
deprived
of
your
share
in
your
father
property
bhavani
said
tarapada
is
quite
positive
that
his
grandfather
never
gave
us
any
thing
except
this
land
vraja
sundari
was
astonished
and
informed
her
son
that
her
husband
had
made
two
copies
of
his
will
one
of
which
was
still
lying
in
her
own
box
the
box
was
opened
and
it
was
found
that
there
was
only
the
deed
of
gift
for
the
property
belonging
to
the
mother
and
nothing
else
the
copy
of
the
will
had
been
taken
out
the
help
of
advisers
was
sought
the
man
who
came
to
their
rescue
was
bagala
the
son
of
their
family
it
was
the
profession
of
the
father
to
look
after
the
spiritual
needs
of
the
village
the
material
side
was
left
to
the
son
the
two
of
them
had
divided
between
themselves
the
other
world
and
this
whatever
might
be
the
result
for
others
they
themselves
had
nothing
to
suffer
from
this
division
bagala
said
that
even
if
the
will
was
missing
the
shares
in
the
ancestral
property
must
be
equal
as
between
the
brothers
just
at
this
time
a
copy
of
a
will
made
its
appearance
supporting
the
claims
of
the
other
side
in
this
document
there
was
no
mention
of
bhavani
and
the
whole
property
was
given
to
the
grandsons
at
the
time
when
no
son
was
born
to
bhavani
with
bagala
as
his
captain
bhavani
set
out
on
his
voyage
across
the
perilous
sea
of
litigation
when
his
vessel
at
last
reached
harbour
his
funds
were
nearly
exhausted
and
the
ancestral
property
was
in
the
hands
of
the
other
party
the
land
which
was
given
to
his
mother
had
dwindled
to
such
an
extent
that
it
could
barely
give
them
shelter
or
keep
up
the
family
dignity
then
tarapada
went
away
to
the
district
town
and
they
never
met
again
ii
shyama
charan
treachery
pierced
the
heart
of
the
widow
like
an
assassin
knife
to
the
end
of
her
life
almost
every
day
she
would
heave
a
sigh
and
say
that
god
would
never
suffer
such
an
injustice
to
be
done
she
was
quite
firm
in
her
faith
when
she
said
to
bhavani
i
do
not
know
your
law
or
your
law
courts
but
i
am
certain
that
my
true
will
and
testament
will
someday
be
recovered
you
will
find
it
again
because
bhavani
was
helpless
in
worldly
matters
such
assurances
as
these
gave
him
great
consolation
he
settled
down
in
his
inactivity
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
his
pious
mother
prophecy
could
never
remain
unfulfilled
after
his
mother
death
his
faith
became
all
the
stronger
since
the
memory
of
her
piety
acquired
greater
radiance
through
mystery
he
felt
quite
unconcerned
about
the
stress
of
their
poverty
which
became
more
and
more
formidable
as
the
years
went
by
the
necessities
of
life
and
the
maintenance
of
family
traditions
these
seemed
to
him
like
play
acting
on
a
temporary
stage
not
real
things
when
his
former
expensive
clothing
was
outworn
and
he
had
to
buy
cheap
materials
in
the
shop
this
amused
him
almost
like
a
joke
he
smiled
and
said
to
himself
these
people
do
not
know
that
this
is
only
a
passing
phase
of
my
fortune
their
surprise
will
be
all
the
greater
when
some
day
i
shall
celebrate
the
puja
festival
with
unwonted
magnificence
this
certainty
of
future
prodigality
was
so
clear
to
his
mind
eye
that
present
penury
escaped
his
attention
his
servant
noto
was
the
principal
companion
with
whom
he
had
discussions
about
these
things
they
used
to
have
animated
conversations
in
which
sometimes
his
opinion
differed
from
his
master
as
to
the
propriety
of
bringing
down
a
theatrical
troupe
from
calcutta
for
these
future
occasions
noto
used
to
get
reprimands
from
bhavani
for
his
natural
miserliness
in
these
items
of
future
expenditure
while
bhavani
one
anxiety
was
about
the
absence
of
an
heir
who
could
inherit
his
vast
possible
wealth
a
son
was
born
to
him
the
horoscope
plainly
indicated
that
the
lost
property
would
come
back
to
this
boy
from
the
time
of
the
birth
of
his
son
bhavani
attitude
was
changed
it
became
cruelly
difficult
for
him
now
to
bear
his
poverty
with
his
old
amused
equanimity
because
he
felt
that
he
had
a
duty
towards
this
new
representative
of
the
illustrious
house
of
saniari
who
had
such
a
glorious
future
before
him
that
the
traditional
extravagance
could
not
be
maintained
on
the
occasion
of
the
birth
of
his
child
gave
him
the
keenest
sorrow
he
felt
as
if
he
were
cheating
his
own
son
so
he
compensated
his
boy
with
an
inordinate
amount
of
spoiling
bhavani
wife
rashmani
had
a
different
temperament
from
her
husband
she
never
felt
any
anxiety
about
the
family
traditions
of
the
chowdhuris
of
saniari
bhavani
was
quite
aware
of
the
fact
and
indulgently
smiled
to
himself
as
though
nothing
better
could
be
expected
from
a
woman
who
came
from
a
vaishnava
family
of
very
humble
lineage
rashmani
frankly
acknowledged
that
she
could
not
share
the
family
sentiments
what
concerned
her
most
was
the
welfare
of
her
own
child
there
was
hardly
an
acquaintance
in
the
neighbourhood
with
whom
bhavani
did
not
discuss
the
question
of
the
lost
will
but
he
never
spoke
a
word
about
it
to
his
wife
once
or
twice
he
had
tried
but
her
perfect
unconcern
had
made
him
drop
the
subject
she
neither
paid
attention
to
the
past
greatness
of
the
family
nor
to
its
future
glories
she
kept
her
mind
busy
with
the
actual
necessities
of
the
present
and
those
necessities
were
not
small
in
number
or
quality
when
the
goddess
of
fortune
deserts
a
house
she
usually
leaves
some
of
her
burdens
behind
and
this
ancient
family
was
still
encumbered
with
its
host
of
dependents
though
its
own
shelter
was
nearly
crumbling
to
dust
these
parasites
take
it
to
be
an
insult
if
they
are
asked
to
do
any
service
they
get
at
the
least
touch
of
the
kitchen
smoke
they
are
visited
with
sudden
rheumatism
the
moment
they
are
asked
to
run
errands
therefore
all
the
responsibilities
of
maintaining
the
family
were
laid
upon
rashmani
herself
women
lose
their
delicacy
of
refinement
when
they
are
compelled
night
and
day
to
haggle
with
their
destiny
over
things
which
are
pitifully
small
and
for
this
they
are
blamed
by
those
for
whom
they
toil
besides
her
household
affairs
rashmani
had
to
keep
all
the
accounts
of
the
little
landed
property
which
remained
and
also
to
make
arrangements
for
collecting
rents
never
before
was
the
estate
managed
with
such
strictness
bhavani
had
been
quite
incapable
of
collecting
his
dues
rashmani
never
made
any
remission
of
the
least
fraction
of
rent
the
tenants
and
even
her
own
agents
reviled
her
behind
her
back
for
the
meanness
of
the
family
from
which
she
came
even
her
husband
occasionally
used
to
enter
his
protest
against
the
harsh
economy
which
went
against
the
grain
of
the
house
of
saniari
rashmani
quite
ungrudgingly
took
the
blame
of
all
this
upon
herself
and
openly
confessed
the
poverty
of
her
parents
tying
the
end
of
her
tightly
round
her
waist
she
went
on
with
her
household
duties
in
her
own
vigorous
fashion
and
made
herself
thoroughly
disagreeable
both
to
the
inmates
of
the
house
and
to
her
neighbours
but
nobody
ever
had
the
courage
to
interfere
only
one
thing
she
carefully
avoided
she
never
asked
her
husband
to
help
her
in
any
work
and
she
was
nervously
afraid
of
his
taking
up
any
responsibilities
indeed
she
was
always
furiously
engaged
in
keeping
her
husband
idle
and
because
he
had
received
the
best
possible
training
in
this
direction
she
was
wholly
successful
in
her
mission
rashmani
had
attained
middle
age
before
her
son
came
up
to
this
time
all
the
tenderness
of
the
mother
in
her
and
all
the
love
of
the
wife
had
their
centre
of
devotion
in
this
husband
bhavani
was
a
child
grown
up
by
mistake
beyond
its
natural
age
this
was
the
reason
why
after
the
death
of
her
husband
mother
she
had
to
assume
the
position
of
mother
and
mistress
in
one
in
order
to
protect
her
husband
from
invasions
of
bagala
the
son
of
the
and
other
calamities
rashmani
adopted
such
a
stern
demeanour
that
the
companions
of
her
husband
used
to
be
terribly
afraid
of
her
she
never
had
the
opportunity
which
a
woman
usually
has
of
keeping
her
fierceness
hidden
and
of
softening
the
keen
edge
of
her
words
maintaining
a
dignified
reserve
towards
men
such
as
is
proper
for
a
woman
bhavani
meekly
accepted
his
wife
authority
with
regard
to
himself
but
it
became
extremely
hard
for
him
to
obey
her
when
it
related
to
kalipada
his
son
the
reason
was
that
rashmani
never
regarded
bhavani
son
from
the
point
of
view
of
bhavani
himself
in
her
heart
she
pitied
her
husband
and
said
poor
man
it
was
no
fault
of
his
but
his
misfortune
to
be
born
into
a
rich
family
that
is
why
she
never
could
expect
her
husband
to
be
deprived
of
any
comfort
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
whatever
might
be
the
condition
of
the
household
finance
she
tried
hard
to
keep
him
in
his
habitual
ease
and
luxury
under
her
régime
all
expense
was
strictly
limited
except
in
the
case
of
bhavani
she
would
never
allow
him
to
notice
if
some
inevitable
gap
occurred
in
the
preparation
of
his
meals
or
his
apparel
she
would
blame
some
imaginary
dog
for
spoiling
dishes
that
were
never
made
and
would
blame
herself
for
her
carelessness
she
would
attack
noto
for
letting
some
fictitious
article
of
dress
be
stolen
or
lost
this
had
the
usual
effect
of
rousing
bhavani
sympathy
on
behalf
of
his
favourite
servant
and
he
would
take
up
his
defence
indeed
it
had
often
happened
that
bhavani
had
confessed
with
shamelessness
that
he
had
used
the
dress
which
had
never
been
bought
and
for
whose
loss
noto
was
blamed
but
what
happened
afterwards
he
had
not
the
power
to
invent
and
was
obliged
to
rely
upon
the
fertile
imagination
of
his
wife
who
was
also
the
accuser
thus
rashmani
treated
her
husband
but
she
never
put
her
son
in
the
same
category
for
he
was
her
own
child
and
why
should
he
be
allowed
to
give
himself
airs
kalipada
had
to
be
content
for
his
breakfast
with
a
few
handfuls
of
puffed
rice
and
some
treacle
during
the
cold
weather
he
had
to
wrap
his
body
as
well
as
his
head
with
a
thick
rough
cotton
she
would
call
his
teacher
before
her
and
warn
him
never
to
spare
her
boy
if
he
was
the
least
neglectful
with
his
lessons
this
treatment
of
his
own
son
was
the
hardest
blow
that
bhavani
charan
suffered
since
the
days
of
his
destitution
but
as
he
had
always
acknowledged
defeat
at
the
hands
of
the
powerful
he
had
not
the
spirit
to
stand
up
against
his
wife
in
her
method
of
dealing
with
the
boy
the
dress
which
rashmani
provided
for
her
son
during
the
puja
festivities
was
made
of
such
poor
material
that
in
former
days
the
very
servants
of
the
house
would
have
rebelled
if
it
had
been
offered
to
them
but
rashmani
more
than
once
tried
her
best
to
explain
to
her
husband
that
kalipada
being
the
most
recent
addition
to
the
chowdhuri
family
had
never
known
their
former
splendour
and
so
was
quite
glad
to
get
what
was
given
to
him
but
this
pathetic
innocence
of
the
boy
about
his
own
destiny
hurt
bhavani
more
than
anything
else
and
he
could
not
forgive
himself
for
deceiving
the
child
when
kalipada
would
dance
for
joy
and
rush
to
him
to
show
him
some
present
from
his
mother
which
was
ridiculously
trivial
bhavani
heart
would
suffer
torture
bagala
the
son
was
now
in
an
affluent
condition
owing
to
his
agency
in
the
law
suit
which
had
brought
about
the
ruin
of
bhavani
with
the
money
which
he
had
in
hand
he
used
to
buy
cheap
tinsel
wares
from
calcutta
before
the
puja
holidays
invisible
ink
absurd
combinations
of
stick
and
umbrella
with
pictures
in
the
corner
silk
fabrics
bought
at
auctions
and
other
things
of
this
kind
attractive
to
the
simple
villagers
these
were
his
stock
in
trade
all
the
forward
young
men
of
the
village
vied
with
one
another
in
rising
above
their
rusticity
by
purchasing
these
sweepings
of
the
calcutta
market
which
they
were
told
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
city
gentry
once
bagala
had
bought
a
wonderful
toy
a
doll
in
the
form
of
a
foreign
woman
which
when
wound
up
would
rise
from
her
chair
and
begin
to
fan
herself
with
sudden
alacrity
kalipada
was
fascinated
by
it
he
had
a
very
good
reason
to
avoid
asking
his
mother
about
the
toy
so
he
went
straight
to
his
father
and
begged
him
to
purchase
it
for
him
bhavani
answered
yes
at
once
but
when
he
heard
the
price
his
face
fell
rashmani
kept
all
the
money
and
he
went
to
her
as
a
timid
beggar
he
began
with
all
sorts
of
irrelevant
remarks
and
then
took
a
desperate
plunge
into
the
subject
with
startling
incoherence
rashmani
briefly
remarked
are
you
mad
bhavani
charan
sat
silent
revolving
in
his
mind
what
to
say
next
look
here
he
exclaimed
i
do
think
i
need
milk
pudding
daily
with
my
dinner
who
told
you
said
rashmani
sharply
the
doctor
says
it
very
bad
for
biliousness
the
doctor
a
fool
but
i
sure
that
rice
agrees
with
me
better
than
your
they
are
too
indigestible
i
never
seen
the
least
sign
of
indigestion
in
you
you
have
been
accustomed
to
them
all
your
life
bhavani
charan
was
ready
enough
to
make
sacrifices
but
there
his
passage
was
barred
butter
might
rise
in
price
but
the
number
of
his
never
diminished
milk
was
quite
enough
for
him
at
his
midday
meal
but
curds
also
had
to
be
supplied
because
that
was
the
family
tradition
rashmani
could
not
have
borne
seeing
him
sit
down
to
his
meal
if
curds
were
not
supplied
therefore
all
his
attempts
to
make
a
breach
in
his
daily
provisions
through
which
the
fanning
foreign
woman
might
enter
were
an
utter
failure
then
bhavani
paid
a
visit
to
bagala
for
no
reason
whatever
and
after
a
great
deal
of
round
about
talk
asked
concerning
the
foreign
doll
of
course
his
straightened
circumstances
had
long
been
known
to
bagala
yet
it
was
a
perfect
misery
to
bhavani
to
have
to
hesitate
to
buy
this
doll
for
his
son
owing
to
want
of
ready
money
swallowing
his
pride
he
brought
out
from
under
his
arm
an
expensive
old
kashmir
shawl
and
said
in
a
husky
voice
my
circumstances
are
bad
just
at
present
and
i
have
got
much
cash
so
i
have
determined
to
mortgage
this
shawl
and
buy
that
doll
for
kalipada
if
the
object
offered
had
been
less
expensive
than
this
kashmir
shawl
bagala
would
at
once
have
closed
the
bargain
but
knowing
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
take
possession
of
this
shawl
in
face
of
the
village
opinion
and
still
more
in
face
of
rashmani
watchfulness
he
refused
to
accept
it
and
bhavani
had
to
go
back
home
disappointed
with
the
kashmir
shawl
hidden
under
his
arm
kalipada
asked
every
day
for
that
foreign
fanning
toy
and
bhavani
smiled
every
day
and
said
wait
a
bit
my
boy
till
the
seventh
day
of
the
moon
comes
round
but
every
new
day
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
keep
up
that
smile
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
moon
bhavani
made
a
sudden
inroad
upon
his
wife
and
said
i
noticed
that
there
something
wrong
with
kalipada
something
the
matter
with
his
health
nonsense
said
rashmani
he
in
the
best
of
health
have
you
noticed
him
sitting
silent
for
hours
together
i
should
be
very
greatly
relieved
if
he
could
sit
still
for
as
many
minutes
when
all
his
arrows
had
missed
their
mark
and
no
impression
had
been
made
bhavani
charan
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
passing
his
fingers
through
his
hair
went
away
and
sat
down
on
the
verandah
and
began
to
smoke
with
fearful
assiduity
on
the
fifth
day
at
his
morning
meal
bhavani
passed
by
the
curds
and
the
milk
pudding
without
touching
them
in
the
evening
he
simply
took
one
single
piece
of
the
were
left
unheeded
he
complained
of
want
of
appetite
this
time
a
considerable
breach
was
made
in
the
fortifications
on
the
sixth
day
rashmani
took
kalipada
into
the
room
and
sweetly
calling
him
by
his
pet
name
said
betu
you
are
old
enough
to
know
that
it
is
the
halfway
house
to
stealing
to
desire
that
which
you
have
kalipada
whimpered
and
said
what
do
i
know
about
it
father
promised
to
give
me
that
doll
rashmani
sat
down
to
explain
to
him
how
much
lay
behind
his
promise
how
much
pain
how
much
affection
how
much
loss
and
privation
rashmani
had
never
in
her
life
before
talked
thus
to
kalipada
because
it
was
her
habit
to
give
short
and
sharp
commands
it
filled
the
boy
with
amazement
when
he
found
his
mother
coaxing
him
and
explaining
things
at
such
a
length
and
mere
child
though
he
was
he
could
fathom
something
of
the
deep
suffering
of
his
mother
heart
yet
at
the
same
time
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
it
was
hard
for
this
boy
to
turn
his
mind
away
altogether
from
that
captivating
foreign
fanning
woman
he
pulled
a
long
face
and
began
to
scratch
the
ground
this
made
rashmani
heart
at
once
hard
and
she
said
in
her
severe
tone
yes
you
may
weep
and
cry
or
become
angry
but
you
shall
never
get
that
which
is
not
for
you
to
have
and
she
hastened
away
without
another
word
kalipada
went
out
bhavani
charan
was
still
smoking
his
hookah
noticing
kalipada
from
a
distance
he
got
up
and
walked
in
the
opposite
direction
as
if
he
had
some
urgent
business
kalipada
ran
to
him
and
said
but
that
doll
bhavani
could
not
raise
a
smile
that
day
he
put
his
arm
round
kalipada
neck
and
said
baba
wait
a
little
i
have
some
pressing
business
to
get
through
let
me
finish
it
first
and
then
we
will
talk
about
it
saying
this
he
went
out
of
his
house
kalipada
saw
him
brush
a
tear
from
his
eyes
he
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
his
father
and
it
was
quite
evident
even
to
this
boy
that
he
was
going
nowhere
in
particular
and
that
he
was
dragging
the
weight
of
a
despair
which
could
not
be
relieved
kalipada
at
once
went
back
to
his
mother
and
said
mother
i
do
want
that
foreign
doll
that
morning
bhavani
charan
returned
late
when
he
sat
down
to
his
meal
after
his
bath
it
was
quite
evident
by
the
look
on
his
face
that
the
curds
and
the
milk
pudding
would
fare
no
better
with
him
than
on
the
day
before
and
that
the
best
part
of
the
fish
would
go
to
the
cat
just
at
this
critical
juncture
rashmani
brought
in
a
box
bound
round
with
twine
and
set
it
before
her
husband
her
intention
had
been
to
reveal
the
mystery
of
this
packet
to
her
husband
when
he
went
to
take
his
nap
after
his
meal
but
in
order
to
remove
the
undeserved
neglect
of
the
curds
and
the
milk
and
the
fish
she
had
to
disclose
its
contents
before
the
time
so
the
foreign
doll
came
out
of
the
box
and
without
more
ado
began
to
fan
itself
vigorously
after
this
the
cat
had
to
go
away
disappointed
bhavani
remarked
to
his
wife
that
the
cooking
was
the
best
he
had
ever
tasted
the
fish
soup
was
incomparable
the
curds
had
set
themselves
with
an
exactness
that
was
rarely
attained
and
the
milk
pudding
was
superb
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
moon
kalipada
got
the
toy
for
which
he
had
been
pining
during
the
whole
of
that
day
he
allowed
the
foreigner
to
go
on
fanning
herself
and
thereby
made
his
boy
companions
jealous
in
any
other
case
this
performance
would
have
seemed
to
him
monotonously
tiresome
but
knowing
that
on
the
following
day
he
would
have
to
give
the
toy
back
his
constancy
to
it
on
that
single
occasion
remained
unabated
at
the
rental
of
two
rupees
per
diem
rashmani
had
hired
it
from
bagala
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
moon
kalipada
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
returned
the
toy
along
with
the
box
and
twine
to
bagala
with
his
own
hands
from
that
day
forward
kalipada
began
to
share
the
confidences
of
his
mother
and
it
became
so
absurdly
easy
for
bhavani
to
give
expensive
presents
every
year
that
it
surprised
even
himself
when
with
the
help
of
his
mother
kalipada
came
to
know
that
nothing
in
this
world
could
be
gained
without
paying
for
it
with
the
inevitable
price
of
suffering
he
rapidly
grew
up
in
his
mind
and
became
a
valued
assistant
to
his
mother
in
her
daily
tasks
it
come
to
be
a
natural
rule
of
life
with
him
that
no
one
should
add
to
the
burden
of
the
world
but
that
each
should
try
to
lighten
it
when
kalipada
won
a
scholarship
at
the
vernacular
examination
bhavani
proposed
that
he
should
give
up
his
studies
and
take
in
hand
the
supervision
of
the
estate
kalipada
went
to
his
mother
and
said
i
shall
never
be
a
man
if
i
do
not
complete
my
education
the
mother
said
you
are
right
baba
you
must
go
to
calcutta
kalipada
explained
to
her
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
spend
a
single
pice
on
him
his
scholarship
would
be
sufficient
and
he
would
try
to
get
some
work
to
supplement
it
but
it
was
necessary
to
convince
bhavani
of
the
wisdom
of
the
course
rashmani
did
not
wish
to
employ
the
argument
that
there
was
very
little
of
the
estate
remaining
to
require
supervision
for
she
knew
how
it
would
hurt
him
she
said
that
kalipada
must
become
a
man
whom
everyone
could
respect
but
all
the
members
of
the
chowdhuri
family
had
attained
their
respectability
without
ever
going
a
step
outside
the
limits
of
saniari
the
outer
world
was
as
unknown
to
them
as
the
world
beyond
the
grave
bhavani
therefore
could
not
conceive
how
anybody
could
think
of
a
boy
like
kalipada
going
to
calcutta
but
the
cleverest
man
in
the
village
bagala
fortunately
agreed
with
rashmani
it
is
perfectly
clear
he
said
that
one
day
kalipada
will
become
a
lawyer
and
then
he
will
set
matters
right
concerning
the
property
of
which
the
family
has
been
deprived
this
was
a
great
consolation
to
bhavani
charan
and
he
brought
out
the
file
of
records
about
the
theft
of
the
will
and
tried
to
explain
the
whole
thing
to
kalipada
by
dint
of
daily
discussion
but
his
son
was
lacking
in
proper
enthusiasm
and
merely
echoed
his
father
sentiment
about
this
solemn
wrong
the
day
before
kalipada
departure
for
calcutta
rashmani
hung
round
his
neck
an
amulet
containing
some
mantras
to
protect
him
from
evils
she
gave
him
at
the
same
time
a
currency
note
advising
him
to
keep
it
for
any
special
emergency
this
note
which
was
the
symbol
of
his
mother
numberless
daily
acts
of
was
the
truest
amulet
of
all
for
kalipada
he
determined
to
keep
it
by
him
and
never
to
spend
it
whatever
might
happen
iii
from
this
time
onward
the
old
interminable
discussions
about
the
theft
of
the
will
became
less
frequent
on
the
part
of
bhavani
his
one
topic
of
conversation
was
the
marvellous
adventure
of
kalipada
in
search
of
his
education
kalipada
was
actually
engaged
in
his
studies
in
the
city
of
calcutta
kalipada
knew
calcutta
as
well
as
the
palm
of
his
hand
kalipada
had
been
the
first
to
hear
the
great
news
that
another
bridge
was
going
to
be
built
over
the
ganges
near
hughli
the
day
on
which
the
father
received
his
son
letter
he
would
go
to
every
house
in
the
village
to
read
it
to
his
neighbours
and
he
would
hardly
find
time
even
to
take
his
spectacles
from
his
nose
on
arriving
at
a
fresh
house
he
would
remove
them
from
their
case
with
the
utmost
deliberation
then
he
would
wipe
them
carefully
with
the
end
of
his
then
word
by
word
he
would
slowly
read
the
letter
through
to
one
neighbour
after
another
with
something
like
the
following
comment
brother
just
listen
what
the
world
coming
to
even
the
dogs
and
the
jackals
are
to
cross
the
holy
ganges
without
washing
the
dust
from
their
feet
who
could
imagine
such
a
sacrilege
no
doubt
it
was
very
deplorable
but
all
the
same
it
gave
bhavani
charan
a
peculiar
pleasure
to
communicate
at
first
hand
such
important
news
from
his
own
son
letter
and
this
more
than
compensated
for
the
spiritual
disaster
which
must
surely
overtake
the
numberless
creatures
of
this
present
age
to
everyone
he
met
he
solemnly
nodded
his
head
and
prophesied
that
the
days
were
soon
coming
when
mother
ganges
would
disappear
altogether
all
the
while
cherishing
the
hope
that
the
news
of
such
a
momentous
event
would
come
to
him
by
letter
from
his
own
son
in
the
proper
time
kalipada
with
very
great
difficulty
scraped
together
just
enough
money
to
pay
his
expenses
till
he
passed
his
matriculation
and
again
won
a
scholarship
bhavani
at
once
made
up
his
mind
to
invite
all
the
village
to
a
feast
for
he
imagined
that
his
son
good
ship
of
fortune
had
now
reached
its
haven
and
there
would
be
no
more
occasion
for
economy
but
he
received
no
encouragement
from
rashmani
kalipada
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
a
place
of
study
in
a
lodging
house
near
his
college
the
proprietor
allowed
him
to
occupy
a
small
room
on
the
ground
floor
which
was
absolutely
useless
for
other
lodgers
in
exchange
for
this
and
his
board
he
had
to
coach
the
son
of
the
owner
of
the
house
the
one
great
advantage
was
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
any
fellow
lodger
ever
sharing
his
quarters
so
although
ventilation
was
lacking
his
studies
were
uninterrupted
those
of
the
students
who
paid
their
rent
and
lived
in
the
upper
story
had
no
concern
with
kalipada
but
soon
it
became
painfully
evident
that
those
who
are
up
above
have
the
power
to
hurl
missiles
at
those
below
with
all
the
more
deadly
force
because
of
their
distance
the
leader
of
those
above
was
sailen
sailen
was
the
scion
of
a
rich
family
it
was
unnecessary
for
him
to
live
in
a
students
mess
but
he
successfully
convinced
his
guardians
that
this
would
be
best
for
his
studies
the
real
reason
was
that
sailen
was
naturally
fond
of
company
and
the
students
lodging
house
was
an
ideal
place
where
he
could
have
all
the
pleasure
of
companionship
without
any
of
its
responsibilities
it
was
the
firm
conviction
of
sailen
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
a
man
of
feeling
the
advantage
of
harbouring
such
a
conviction
was
that
it
needed
no
proof
in
practice
vanity
is
not
like
a
horse
or
an
elephant
requiring
expensive
fodder
nevertheless
as
sailen
had
plenty
of
money
he
did
not
allow
his
vanity
merely
to
graze
at
large
he
took
special
pride
in
keeping
it
it
must
be
said
to
his
credit
that
he
had
a
genuine
desire
to
help
people
in
their
need
but
the
desire
in
him
was
of
such
a
character
that
if
a
man
in
difficulty
refused
to
come
to
him
for
help
he
would
turn
round
on
him
and
do
his
best
to
add
to
his
trouble
his
mess
mates
had
their
tickets
for
the
theatre
bought
for
them
by
sailen
and
it
cost
them
nothing
to
have
occasional
feasts
they
could
borrow
money
from
him
without
meaning
to
pay
it
back
when
a
newly
married
youth
was
in
doubt
about
the
choice
of
some
gift
for
his
wife
he
could
fully
rely
on
sailen
good
taste
in
the
matter
on
these
occasions
the
youth
would
take
sailen
to
the
shop
and
pretend
to
select
the
cheapest
and
least
suitable
presents
then
sailen
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
would
intervene
and
select
the
right
thing
at
the
mention
of
the
price
the
young
husband
would
pull
a
long
face
but
sailen
would
always
be
ready
to
abide
by
his
own
superior
choice
and
to
pay
the
cost
in
this
manner
sailen
became
the
acknowledged
patron
of
the
students
upstairs
it
made
him
intolerant
of
the
insolence
of
any
one
who
refused
to
accept
his
help
indeed
to
help
others
in
this
way
had
become
his
hobby
kalipada
in
his
tattered
jersey
used
to
sit
on
a
dirty
mat
in
his
damp
room
below
and
recite
his
lessons
swinging
himself
from
side
to
side
to
the
rhythm
of
the
sentence
it
was
a
sheer
necessity
for
him
to
get
that
scholarship
next
year
kalipada
mother
had
made
him
promise
before
he
left
home
for
calcutta
that
he
would
avoid
the
company
of
rich
young
men
therefore
he
bore
the
burden
of
his
indigence
alone
strictly
keeping
himself
from
those
who
had
been
more
favoured
by
fortune
but
to
sailen
it
seemed
a
sheer
impertinence
that
a
student
as
poor
as
kalipada
should
yet
have
the
pride
to
keep
away
from
his
patronage
besides
this
in
his
food
and
dress
and
everything
kalipada
poverty
was
so
blatantly
exposed
it
hurt
sailen
sense
of
decency
every
time
he
looked
down
into
kalipada
room
he
was
offended
by
the
sight
of
the
cheap
clothing
the
dingy
mosquito
net
and
the
tattered
bedding
whenever
he
passed
on
his
way
to
his
own
room
in
the
upper
story
the
sight
of
these
things
was
unavoidable
to
crown
it
all
there
was
that
absurd
amulet
which
kalipada
always
had
hanging
round
his
neck
and
those
daily
rites
of
devotion
which
were
so
ridiculously
out
of
fashion
one
day
sailen
and
his
followers
condescended
to
invite
kalipada
to
a
feast
thinking
that
his
gratitude
would
know
no
bounds
but
kalipada
sent
an
answer
saying
that
his
habits
were
different
and
it
would
not
be
wholesome
for
him
to
accept
the
invitation
sailen
was
unaccustomed
to
such
a
refusal
and
it
roused
up
in
him
all
the
ferocity
of
his
insulted
benevolence
for
some
days
after
this
the
noise
on
the
upper
story
became
so
loudly
insistent
that
it
was
impossible
for
kalipada
to
go
on
with
his
studies
he
was
compelled
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
his
days
studying
in
the
park
and
to
get
up
very
early
and
sit
down
to
his
work
long
before
it
was
light
owing
to
his
condition
his
mental
overwork
and
room
kalipada
began
to
suffer
from
continual
attacks
of
headache
there
were
times
when
he
was
obliged
to
lie
down
on
his
bed
for
three
or
four
days
together
but
he
made
no
mention
of
his
illness
in
his
letters
to
his
father
bhavani
himself
was
certain
that
just
as
vegetation
grew
rank
in
his
village
surroundings
so
comforts
of
all
kinds
sprang
up
of
themselves
from
the
soil
of
calcutta
kalipada
never
for
a
moment
disabused
his
mind
of
that
misconception
he
did
not
fail
to
write
to
his
father
even
when
suffering
from
one
of
these
paroxysms
of
pain
the
deliberate
rowdiness
of
the
students
in
the
upper
story
added
at
such
times
to
his
distress
kalipada
tried
to
make
himself
as
scarce
and
small
as
possible
in
order
to
avoid
notice
but
this
did
not
bring
him
relief
one
day
he
found
that
a
cheap
shoe
of
his
own
had
been
taken
away
and
replaced
by
an
expensive
foreign
one
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
college
with
such
an
incongruous
pair
he
made
no
complaint
however
but
bought
some
old
shoes
from
the
cobbler
one
day
a
student
from
the
upper
story
came
into
his
room
and
asked
him
have
you
by
any
mistake
brought
away
my
silver
cigarette
case
with
you
kalipada
got
annoyed
and
answered
i
have
never
been
inside
your
room
in
my
life
the
student
stooped
down
hullo
he
said
here
it
is
and
the
valuable
cigarette
case
was
picked
up
from
the
corner
of
the
room
kalipada
determined
to
leave
this
lodging
house
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
passed
his
intermediate
examination
provided
only
he
could
get
a
scholarship
to
enable
him
to
do
so
every
year
the
students
of
the
house
used
to
have
their
annual
saraswati
puja
though
the
greater
part
of
the
expenses
fell
to
the
share
of
sailen
every
one
else
contributed
according
to
his
means
the
year
before
they
had
contemptuously
left
out
kalipada
from
the
list
of
contributors
but
this
year
merely
to
tease
him
they
came
with
their
subscription
book
kalipada
instantly
paid
five
rupees
to
the
fund
though
he
had
no
intention
of
participating
in
the
feast
his
penury
had
long
brought
on
him
the
contempt
of
his
fellow
lodgers
but
this
unexpected
gift
of
five
rupees
became
to
them
insufferable
the
saraswati
puja
was
performed
with
great
éclat
and
the
five
rupees
could
easily
have
been
spared
it
had
been
hard
indeed
for
kalipada
to
part
with
it
while
he
took
the
food
given
him
in
his
landlord
house
he
had
no
control
over
the
time
at
which
it
was
served
besides
this
since
the
servants
brought
him
the
food
he
did
not
like
to
criticise
the
dishes
he
preferred
to
provide
himself
with
some
extra
things
and
after
the
forced
extravagance
of
his
subscription
he
had
to
forgo
all
this
and
suffered
in
consequence
his
paroxysms
of
headache
became
more
frequent
and
though
he
passed
his
examination
he
failed
to
obtain
the
scholarship
that
he
desired
the
loss
of
the
scholarship
drove
kalipada
to
do
extra
work
as
a
private
tutor
and
to
stick
to
the
same
unhealthy
room
in
the
lodging
house
the
students
overhead
had
hoped
that
they
would
be
relieved
of
his
presence
but
punctually
to
the
day
the
room
was
unlocked
on
the
lower
floor
kalipada
entered
clad
in
the
same
old
dirty
check
parsee
coat
a
coolie
from
sealdah
station
took
down
from
his
head
a
steel
trunk
and
other
miscellaneous
packages
and
laid
them
on
the
floor
of
the
room
and
a
long
wrangle
ensued
as
to
the
proper
amount
of
pice
that
were
due
in
the
depths
of
those
packages
there
were
mango
chutnies
and
other
condiments
which
his
mother
had
specially
prepared
kalipada
was
aware
that
in
his
absence
the
students
in
search
of
a
jest
did
not
scruple
to
come
into
his
room
by
stealth
he
was
especially
anxious
to
keep
these
home
gifts
from
their
cruel
scrutiny
as
tokens
of
home
affection
they
were
supremely
precious
to
him
but
to
the
town
students
they
denoted
merely
the
boorishness
of
villagers
the
vessels
were
crude
and
earthen
fastened
up
by
an
earthen
lid
fixed
on
with
paste
of
flour
they
were
neither
glass
nor
porcelain
and
therefore
sure
to
be
regarded
with
insolent
disdain
by
rich
people
formerly
kalipada
used
to
keep
these
stores
hidden
under
his
bed
covering
them
up
with
old
newspapers
but
this
time
he
took
the
precaution
of
always
locking
up
his
door
even
if
he
went
out
for
a
few
minutes
this
still
further
roused
the
spleen
of
sailen
and
his
party
it
seemed
to
them
preposterous
that
the
room
which
was
poor
enough
to
draw
tears
from
the
eyes
of
the
most
hardened
burglar
should
be
as
carefully
guarded
as
if
it
were
a
second
bank
of
bengal
does
he
actually
believe
they
said
among
themselves
that
the
temptation
will
be
irresistible
for
us
to
steal
that
parsee
coat
sailen
had
never
visited
this
dark
and
mildewed
room
from
which
the
plaster
was
dropping
the
glimpses
that
he
had
taken
while
going
especially
when
in
the
evening
kalipada
the
upper
part
of
his
body
bare
would
sit
poring
over
his
books
with
a
smoky
lamp
beside
him
were
enough
to
give
him
a
sense
of
suffocation
sailen
asked
his
boon
companions
to
explore
the
room
below
and
find
out
the
treasure
which
kalipada
had
hidden
everybody
felt
intensely
amused
at
the
proposal
the
lock
on
kalipada
door
was
a
cheap
one
which
had
the
magnanimity
to
lend
itself
to
any
key
one
evening
when
kalipada
had
gone
out
to
his
private
tuition
two
or
three
of
the
students
with
an
exuberant
sense
of
humour
took
a
lantern
and
unlocked
the
room
and
entered
it
did
not
need
a
moment
to
discover
the
pots
of
chutney
under
the
bed
but
these
hardly
seemed
valuable
enough
to
demand
such
watchful
care
on
the
part
of
kalipada
a
further
search
disclosed
a
key
on
a
ring
under
the
pillow
they
opened
the
steel
trunk
with
the
key
and
found
a
few
soiled
clothes
books
and
writing
material
they
were
about
to
shut
the
box
in
disgust
when
they
saw
at
the
very
bottom
a
packet
covered
by
a
dirty
handkerchief
on
uncovering
three
or
four
wrappers
they
found
a
currency
note
of
fifty
rupees
this
made
them
burst
out
into
peals
of
laughter
they
felt
certain
that
kalipada
was
harbouring
suspicion
against
the
whole
world
in
his
mind
because
of
this
fifty
rupees
the
meanness
of
this
suspicious
precaution
deepened
the
intensity
of
their
contempt
for
kalipada
just
then
they
heard
a
outside
they
hastily
shut
the
box
locked
the
door
and
ran
upstairs
with
the
note
in
their
possession
sailen
was
vastly
amused
though
fifty
rupees
was
a
mere
trifle
he
could
never
have
believed
that
kalipada
had
so
much
money
in
his
trunk
they
all
decided
to
watch
the
result
of
this
loss
upon
that
queer
creature
downstairs
when
kalipada
came
home
that
night
after
his
tuition
was
over
he
was
too
tired
to
notice
any
disorder
in
his
room
one
of
his
worst
attacks
of
nervous
headache
was
coming
on
and
he
went
straight
to
bed
the
next
day
when
he
brought
out
his
trunk
from
under
the
bed
and
took
out
his
clothes
he
found
it
open
he
was
naturally
careful
but
it
was
not
unlikely
he
thought
that
he
had
forgotten
to
lock
it
on
the
day
before
but
when
he
lifted
the
lid
he
found
all
the
contents
and
his
heart
gave
a
great
thud
when
he
discovered
that
the
note
given
to
him
by
his
mother
was
missing
he
searched
the
box
over
and
over
again
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
it
and
when
his
loss
was
made
certain
he
flung
himself
upon
his
bed
and
lay
like
one
dead
just
then
he
heard
footsteps
following
one
another
on
the
stairs
and
every
now
and
then
an
outburst
of
laughter
from
the
upper
room
it
struck
him
all
of
a
sudden
that
this
was
not
a
theft
sailen
and
his
party
must
have
taken
the
note
to
amuse
themselves
and
make
laughter
out
of
it
it
would
have
given
him
less
pain
if
a
thief
had
stolen
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
these
young
men
had
laid
their
impious
hands
upon
his
mother
herself
this
was
the
first
time
that
kalipada
had
ascended
those
stairs
he
ran
to
the
upper
floor
the
old
jersey
on
his
shoulders
his
face
flushed
with
anger
and
the
pain
of
his
illness
as
it
was
sunday
sailen
and
his
company
were
seated
in
the
verandah
laughing
and
talking
without
any
warning
kalipada
burst
upon
them
and
shouted
give
me
back
my
note
if
he
had
begged
it
of
them
they
would
have
relented
but
the
sight
of
his
anger
made
them
furious
they
started
up
from
their
chairs
and
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
sir
what
do
you
mean
what
note
kalipada
shouted
the
note
you
have
taken
from
my
box
how
dare
you
they
shouted
back
do
you
take
us
to
be
thieves
if
kalipada
had
held
any
weapon
in
his
hand
at
that
moment
he
certainly
would
have
killed
some
one
among
them
but
when
he
was
about
to
spring
they
fell
on
him
and
four
or
five
of
them
dragged
him
down
to
his
room
and
thrust
him
inside
sailen
said
to
his
companions
here
take
this
note
and
throw
it
to
that
they
all
loudly
exclaimed
no
let
him
climb
down
first
and
give
us
a
written
apology
then
we
shall
consider
it
sailen
party
all
went
to
bed
at
the
proper
time
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
innocent
in
the
morning
they
had
almost
forgotten
kalipada
but
some
of
them
while
passing
his
room
heard
the
sound
of
talking
and
they
thought
that
possibly
he
was
busy
consulting
some
lawyer
the
door
was
shut
from
the
inside
they
tried
to
overhear
but
what
they
heard
had
nothing
legal
about
it
it
was
quite
incoherent
they
informed
sailen
he
came
down
and
stood
with
his
ear
close
to
the
door
the
only
thing
that
could
be
distinctly
heard
was
the
word
this
frightened
sailen
he
thought
that
possibly
kalipada
had
gone
mad
on
account
of
the
grief
of
losing
that
note
sailen
shouted
kalipada
babu
two
or
three
times
but
got
no
answer
only
that
muttering
sound
continued
sailen
called
kalipada
babu
please
open
the
door
your
note
has
been
found
but
still
the
door
was
not
opened
and
that
muttering
sound
went
on
sailen
had
never
anticipated
such
a
result
as
this
he
did
not
express
a
word
of
repentance
to
his
followers
but
he
felt
the
sting
of
it
all
the
same
some
advised
him
to
break
open
the
door
others
thought
that
the
police
should
be
called
in
for
kalipada
might
be
in
a
dangerous
state
of
lunacy
sailen
at
once
sent
for
a
doctor
who
lived
close
at
hand
when
they
burst
open
the
door
they
found
the
bedding
hanging
from
the
bed
and
kalipada
lying
on
the
floor
unconscious
he
was
tossing
about
and
throwing
up
his
arms
and
muttering
with
his
eyes
red
and
open
and
his
face
all
flushed
the
doctor
examined
him
and
asked
if
there
were
any
relative
near
at
hand
for
the
case
was
serious
sailen
answered
that
he
knew
nothing
but
would
make
inquiries
the
doctor
then
advised
the
removal
of
the
patient
at
once
to
an
upstairs
room
and
proper
nursing
arrangements
day
and
night
sailen
took
him
up
to
his
own
room
and
dismissed
his
followers
he
got
some
ice
and
put
it
on
kalipada
head
and
began
to
fan
him
with
his
own
hand
kalipada
fearing
that
mocking
references
would
be
made
had
concealed
the
names
and
address
of
his
parents
from
these
people
with
special
care
so
sailen
had
no
alternative
but
to
open
his
box
he
found
two
bundles
of
letters
tied
up
with
ribbon
one
of
them
contained
his
mother
letters
the
other
contained
his
father
his
mother
letters
were
fewer
in
number
than
his
father
sailen
closed
the
door
and
began
to
read
the
letters
he
was
startled
when
he
saw
the
address
saniari
the
house
of
the
chowdhuries
and
then
the
name
of
the
father
bhavani
he
folded
up
the
letters
and
sat
still
gazing
at
kalipada
face
some
of
his
friends
had
casually
mentioned
that
there
was
a
resemblance
between
kalipada
and
himself
but
he
was
offended
at
the
remark
and
did
not
believe
it
he
discovered
the
truth
he
knew
that
his
own
grandfather
shyama
charan
had
a
named
bhavani
but
the
later
history
to
the
family
had
remained
a
secret
to
him
he
did
not
even
know
that
bhavani
had
a
son
named
kalipada
and
he
never
suspected
that
bhavani
had
come
to
such
an
abject
state
of
poverty
as
this
he
now
felt
not
only
relieved
but
proud
of
his
own
relative
kalipada
that
he
had
refused
to
enter
himself
on
the
list
of
protégés
iv
knowing
that
his
party
had
insulted
kalipada
almost
every
day
sailen
felt
reluctant
to
keep
him
in
the
lodging
house
with
them
so
he
rented
another
suitable
house
and
kept
him
there
bhavani
came
down
in
haste
to
calcutta
the
moment
he
received
a
letter
from
sailen
informing
him
of
his
son
illness
rashmani
parted
with
all
her
savings
giving
instructions
to
her
husband
to
spare
no
expense
upon
her
son
it
was
not
considered
proper
for
the
daughters
of
the
great
chowdhuri
family
to
leave
their
home
and
go
to
calcutta
unless
absolutely
obliged
and
therefore
she
had
to
remain
behind
offering
prayers
to
all
the
tutelary
gods
when
bhavani
charan
arrived
he
found
kalipada
still
unconscious
and
delirious
it
nearly
broke
bhavani
heart
when
he
heard
himself
called
mashai
kalipada
often
called
him
in
his
delirium
and
he
tried
to
make
himself
recognized
by
his
son
but
in
vain
the
doctor
came
again
and
said
the
fever
was
getting
less
he
thought
the
case
was
taking
a
more
favourable
turn
for
bhavani
it
was
an
impossibility
to
imagine
that
his
son
would
not
recover
he
live
it
was
his
destiny
to
live
bhavani
was
much
struck
with
the
behaviour
of
sailen
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
he
was
not
of
their
own
kith
and
kin
he
supposed
all
this
kindness
to
be
due
to
the
town
training
which
sailen
had
received
bhavani
spoke
to
sailen
disparagingly
of
the
country
habits
which
village
people
like
himself
got
into
gradually
the
fever
went
down
and
kalipada
recovered
consciousness
he
was
astonished
beyond
measure
when
he
saw
his
father
sitting
in
the
room
beside
him
his
first
anxiety
was
lest
he
should
discover
the
miserable
state
in
which
he
had
been
living
but
what
would
be
harder
still
to
bear
was
if
his
father
with
his
rustic
manners
became
the
butt
of
the
people
upstairs
he
looked
round
him
but
could
not
recognize
his
own
room
and
wondered
if
he
had
been
dreaming
but
he
found
himself
too
weak
to
think
he
supposed
that
it
had
been
his
father
who
had
removed
him
to
this
better
lodging
but
he
had
no
power
to
calculate
how
he
could
possibly
bear
the
expense
the
only
thing
that
concerned
him
at
that
moment
was
that
he
felt
he
must
live
and
for
that
he
had
a
claim
upon
the
world
once
when
his
father
was
absent
sailen
came
in
with
a
plate
of
grapes
in
his
hand
kalipada
could
not
understand
this
at
all
and
wondered
if
there
was
some
practical
joke
behind
it
he
at
once
became
excited
and
wondered
how
he
could
save
his
father
from
annoyance
sailen
set
the
plate
down
on
the
table
and
touched
kalipada
feet
humbly
and
said
my
offence
has
been
great
pray
forgive
me
kalipada
started
and
sat
up
on
his
bed
he
could
see
that
repentance
was
sincere
and
he
was
greatly
moved
when
kalipada
had
first
come
to
the
students
lodging
house
he
had
felt
strongly
drawn
towards
this
handsome
youth
he
never
missed
a
chance
of
looking
at
his
face
when
sailen
passed
by
his
room
on
his
way
upstairs
he
would
have
given
all
the
world
to
be
friends
with
him
but
the
barrier
was
too
great
to
overcome
now
when
sailen
brought
him
the
grapes
and
asked
his
forgiveness
he
silently
looked
at
his
face
and
silently
accepted
the
grapes
which
spoke
of
his
repentance
it
amused
kalipada
greatly
when
he
noticed
the
intimacy
that
had
sprung
up
between
his
father
and
sailen
sailen
used
to
call
bhavani
charan
grandfather
and
exercised
to
the
full
the
grandchild
privilege
of
joking
with
him
the
principal
object
of
the
jokes
was
the
absent
grandmother
sailen
made
the
confession
that
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
kalipada
illness
to
steal
all
the
delicious
chutnies
which
his
grandmother
had
made
with
her
own
hand
the
news
of
his
act
of
thieving
gave
kalipada
very
great
joy
he
found
it
easy
to
deprive
himself
if
he
could
find
any
one
who
could
appreciate
the
good
things
made
by
his
mother
thus
this
time
of
his
convalescence
became
the
happiest
period
in
the
whole
of
kalipada
life
there
was
only
one
flaw
in
this
unalloyed
happiness
kalipada
had
a
fierce
pride
in
his
poverty
which
prevented
him
ever
speaking
about
his
family
better
days
therefore
when
his
father
used
to
talk
of
his
former
prosperity
kalipada
winced
bhavani
could
not
keep
to
himself
the
one
great
event
of
his
life
the
theft
of
that
will
which
he
was
absolutely
certain
that
he
would
some
day
recover
kalipada
had
always
regarded
this
as
a
kind
of
mania
of
his
father
and
in
collusion
with
his
mother
he
had
often
humoured
his
father
concerning
this
amiable
weakness
but
he
shrank
in
shame
when
his
father
talked
about
this
to
sailen
he
noticed
particularly
that
sailen
did
not
relish
such
conversation
and
that
he
often
tried
to
prove
with
a
certain
amount
of
feeling
its
absurdity
but
bhavani
who
was
ready
to
give
in
to
others
in
matters
much
more
serious
in
this
matter
was
adamant
kalipada
tried
to
pacify
him
by
saying
that
there
was
no
great
need
to
worry
about
it
because
those
who
were
enjoying
its
benefit
were
almost
the
same
as
his
own
children
since
they
were
his
nephews
such
talk
sailen
could
not
bear
for
long
and
he
used
to
leave
the
room
this
pained
kalipada
because
he
thought
that
sailen
might
get
quite
a
wrong
conception
of
his
father
and
imagine
him
to
be
a
grasping
worldly
old
man
sailen
would
have
revealed
his
own
relationship
to
kalipada
and
his
father
long
before
but
this
discussion
about
the
theft
of
the
will
prevented
him
it
was
hard
for
him
to
believe
that
his
grandfather
or
father
had
stolen
the
will
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
but
think
that
some
cruel
injustice
had
been
done
in
depriving
bhavani
of
his
share
of
the
ancestral
property
therefore
he
gave
up
arguing
when
the
subject
was
brought
forward
and
took
some
occasion
to
leave
as
soon
as
possible
though
kalipada
still
had
headaches
in
the
evening
with
a
slight
rise
in
temperature
he
did
not
take
it
at
all
seriously
he
became
anxious
to
resume
his
studies
because
he
felt
it
would
be
a
calamity
to
him
if
he
again
missed
his
scholarship
he
secretly
began
to
read
once
more
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
strict
orders
of
the
doctor
kalipada
asked
his
father
to
return
home
assuring
him
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
health
bhavani
had
been
all
his
life
fed
and
nourished
and
cooked
for
by
his
wife
he
was
pining
to
get
back
he
did
not
therefore
wait
to
be
pressed
on
the
morning
of
his
intended
departure
when
he
went
to
say
to
kalipada
he
found
him
very
ill
indeed
his
face
red
with
fever
and
his
whole
body
burning
he
had
been
committing
to
memory
page
after
page
of
his
text
book
of
logic
half
through
the
night
and
for
the
remainder
he
could
not
sleep
at
all
the
doctor
took
sailen
aside
this
relapse
he
said
is
fatal
sailen
came
to
bhavani
and
said
the
patient
requires
a
mother
nursing
she
must
be
brought
to
calcutta
it
was
evening
when
rashmani
came
and
she
only
saw
her
son
alive
for
a
few
hours
not
knowing
how
her
husband
could
survive
such
a
terrible
shock
she
altogether
suppressed
her
own
sorrow
her
son
was
merged
in
her
husband
again
and
she
took
up
this
burden
of
the
dead
and
the
living
on
her
own
aching
heart
she
said
to
her
god
it
is
too
much
for
me
to
bear
but
she
did
bear
it
v
it
was
midnight
with
the
very
weariness
of
her
sorrow
rashmani
had
fallen
asleep
soon
after
reaching
her
own
home
in
the
village
but
bhavani
had
no
sleep
that
night
tossing
on
his
bed
for
hours
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
saying
merciful
god
then
he
got
up
from
his
bed
and
went
out
he
entered
the
room
where
kalipada
had
been
wont
to
do
his
lessons
in
his
childhood
the
lamp
shook
as
he
held
it
in
his
hand
on
the
wooden
settle
there
was
still
the
torn
quilt
made
long
ago
by
rashmani
herself
on
the
wall
were
figures
of
euclid
and
algebra
drawn
in
charcoal
the
remains
of
a
royal
reader
no
iii
and
a
few
exercise
books
were
lying
about
and
the
one
odd
slipper
of
his
infancy
which
had
evaded
notice
so
long
was
keeping
its
place
in
the
dusty
obscurity
of
the
corner
of
the
room
it
had
become
so
important
that
nothing
in
the
world
however
great
could
keep
it
hidden
any
longer
bhavani
put
the
lamp
in
the
niche
on
the
wall
and
silently
sat
on
the
settle
his
eyes
were
dry
but
he
felt
choked
as
if
with
want
of
breath
bhavani
opened
the
shutters
on
the
eastern
side
and
stood
still
grasping
the
iron
bars
gazing
into
the
darkness
through
the
drizzling
rain
he
could
see
the
outline
of
the
clump
of
trees
at
the
end
of
the
outer
wall
at
this
spot
kalipada
had
made
his
own
garden
the
passion
flowers
which
he
had
planted
with
his
own
hand
had
grown
densely
thick
while
he
gazed
at
this
bhavani
felt
his
heart
come
up
into
his
throat
with
choking
pain
there
was
nobody
now
to
wait
for
and
expect
daily
the
summer
vacation
had
come
but
no
one
would
come
back
home
to
fill
the
vacant
room
and
use
its
old
familiar
furniture
o
baba
mine
he
cried
o
baba
o
baba
mine
he
sat
down
the
rain
came
faster
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
among
the
grass
and
withered
leaves
bhavani
heart
stood
still
he
hoped
it
was
that
which
was
beyond
all
hope
he
thought
it
was
kalipada
himself
come
to
see
his
own
garden
and
in
this
downpour
of
rain
how
wet
he
would
be
anxiety
about
this
made
him
restless
then
somebody
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
of
the
iron
window
bars
the
cloak
round
his
head
made
it
impossible
for
bhavani
to
see
his
face
clearly
but
his
height
was
the
same
as
that
of
kalipada
darling
cried
bhavani
you
have
come
and
he
rushed
to
open
the
door
but
when
he
came
outside
to
the
spot
where
the
figure
had
stood
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
he
walked
up
and
down
in
the
garden
through
the
drenching
rain
but
no
one
was
there
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
raising
his
voice
and
calling
kalipada
but
no
answer
came
the
servant
noto
who
was
sleeping
in
the
cowshed
heard
his
cry
and
came
out
and
coaxed
him
back
to
his
room
next
day
in
the
morning
noto
while
sweeping
the
room
found
a
bundle
just
underneath
the
grated
window
he
brought
it
to
bhavani
who
opened
it
and
found
it
was
an
old
document
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
after
reading
a
few
lines
came
rushing
in
to
rashmani
and
gave
the
paper
into
her
hand
rashmani
asked
what
is
it
bhavani
replied
it
is
the
will
who
gave
it
you
he
himself
came
last
night
to
give
it
to
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
bhavani
said
i
have
no
need
of
it
now
and
he
tore
the
will
to
pieces
when
the
news
reached
the
village
bagala
proudly
nodded
his
head
and
said
did
i
prophesy
that
the
will
would
be
recovered
through
kalipada
but
the
grocer
ramcharan
replied
last
night
when
the
ten
train
reached
the
station
a
handsome
looking
young
man
came
to
my
shop
and
asked
the
way
to
the
chowdhuri
house
and
i
thought
he
had
some
kind
of
bundle

his
hand

to
be
studied

latin
vertere
to
turn

this
word
is
of
doubtful
origin
we
have
the
simpler
form
maze
but
do
not
know
how
it
has
come
into
english
the
latin
word
pre
means
before
and
the
latin
word
posterus
behind
the
literal
meaning
therefore
is
and
so
absurd
outrageous
this
comes
from
the
old
french
treacher
to
trick
it
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
word
traitor
which
comes
from
the
latin
traditor
one
who

up
of
two
words

quite
common

this
word
still
retains
its
french
form
and
accent
and
pronunciation
little
by
little
such
french
words
become
pronounced
and
spelt
in
an
english
form
and
take
a
permanent
place
in
the
language
for
instance
the
french
word
morale
with
accent
on
the
last
syllable
is
now
becoming
a
common
english
word
in
time
it
will
probably
be
accented
on
the
first
syllable
like
ordinary
english
words
and
will
drop
its
final
this
is
another
old
norwegian
word
meaning
a
wide
opening
compare
these
norwegian
words
came
into
english
somewhat
plentifully
at
the
time
of
the
danish
conquest
from
the
greek
syn

pathos

it
should
be
noted
that
the
word
compassion
from
the
latin
cum

passio
suffering
has
the
same
root
meaning
viz
suffering

the

the

dropped
their
french
spelling
altogether

the
old

the
english

from
the

have
here
a
case

a
french
word
branching
off
into
two
quite
distinct
english
words
etiquette

its
own
meaning
one

the
islands

english
words
are
thus
taken
from
the
names
of
places
compare
corinth
ragusa
calicut
brundusium
egyptian
kashmir
originally
this
word
means
that
which
is
not
pertinent
and
so
something
later
on
it
got
the
present
meaning
of
something
insolent
from
the
spanish
the
word
is
the
diminutive
of
the
latin
musca
a
fly

the
latin
scrupulus
a
small
sharp
stone
this
word
meant
first
in
english
a
very
small
weight
of
twenty
grains
then
it
came
to
mean
a
slight
weight
on
the
mind
or
conscience
in
the
trial
scene
of
shakespeare
merchant
of
venice
we
have
the
original
sense
used
the
twentieth
part
of
one
poor
scruple
from
the
latin
uber
udder
thus
it
comes
to
mean
flowing
from
the
udder
and
so
overflowing
kerchief
came
from
two
french
words
couvre
to
cover
and
chef
the
head
it
meant
a
head
cloth
then
a
smaller
cloth
was
used
in

hand
and
this
was
called
a

the
latin
luna

former
times
europeans
used
to
think
that
madness
was

subject
is
usually
called
geometry
from
the
latin
surdus
deaf
deaf
people
generally
appear
stupid
to
those
who
can
hear
so
this
word
has
come
to
mean
foolish
or
ridiculous
this
probably
is
a
shortened
form
of
turvy
being
a
colloquial
corruption
for
turned
or
turned
over
the
babus
of
nayanjore
x
the
babus
of
nayanjore
i
once
upon
a
time
the
babus
at
nayanjore
were
famous
landholders
they
were
noted
for
their
princely
extravagance
they
would
tear
off
the
rough
border
of
their
dacca
muslin
because
it
rubbed
against
their
delicate
skin
they
could
spend
many
thousands
of
rupees
over
the
wedding
of
a
kitten
and
on
a
certain
grand
occasion
it
is
alleged
that
in
order
to
turn
night
into
day
they
lighted
numberless
lamps
and
showered
silver
threads
from
the
sky
to
imitate
sunlight
those
were
the
days
before
the
flood
the
flood
came
the
line
of
succession
among
these
babus
with
their
lordly
habits
could
not
continue
for
long
like
a
lamp
with
too
many
wicks
burning
the
oil
flared
away
quickly
and
the
light
went
out
kailas
babu
our
neighbour
is
the
last
relic
of
this
extinct
magnificence
before
he
grew
up
his
family
had
very
nearly
reached
its
lowest
ebb
when
his
father
died
there
was
one
dazzling
outburst
of
funeral
extravagance
and
then
insolvency
the
property
was
sold
to
liquidate
the
debt
what
little
ready
money
was
left
over
was
altogether
insufficient
to
keep
up
the
past
ancestral
splendours
kailas
babu
left
nayanjore
and
came
to
calcutta
his
son
did
not
remain
long
in
this
world
of
faded
glory
he
died
leaving
behind
him
an
only
daughter
in
calcutta
we
are
kailas
babu
neighbours
curiously
enough
our
own
family
history
is
just
the
opposite
of
his
my
father
got
his
money
by
his
own
exertions
and
prided
himself
on
never
spending
a
penny
more
than
was
needed
his
clothes
were
those
of
a
working
man
and
his
hands
also
he
never
had
any
inclination
to
earn
the
title
of
babu
by
extravagant
display
and
i
myself
his
only
son
owe
him
gratitude
for
that
he
gave
me
the
very
best
education
and
i
was
able
to
make
my
way
in
the
world
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
fact
that
i
am
a
man
crisp
in
my
safe
are
dearer
to
me
than
a
long
pedigree
in
an
empty
family
chest
i
believe
this
was
why
i
disliked
seeing
kailas
babu
drawing
his
heavy
cheques
on
the
public
credit
from
the
bankrupt
bank
of
his
ancient
babu
reputation
i
used
to
fancy
that
he
looked
down
on
me
because
my
father
had
earned
money
with
his
own
hands
i
ought
to
have
noticed
that
no
one
showed
any
vexation
towards
kailas
babu
except
myself
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
an
old
man
who
did
less
harm
than
he
he
was
always
ready
with
his
kindly
little
acts
of
courtesy
in
times
of
sorrow
and
joy
he
would
join
in
all
the
ceremonies
and
religious
observances
of
his
neighbours
his
familiar
smile
would
greet
young
and
old
alike
his
politeness
in
asking
details
about
domestic
affairs
was
untiring
the
friends
who
met
him
in
the
street
were
perforce
ready
to
be
while
a
long
string
of
questions
of
this
kind
followed
one
another
from
his
lips
my
dear
friend
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
are
you
quite
well
how
is
shashi
and
dada
is
he
all
right
do
you
know
i
only
just
heard
that
madhu
son
has
got
fever
how
is
he
have
you
heard
and
hari
charan
babu
i
have
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
i
hope
he
is
not
what
the
matter
with
rakkhal
and
er
er
how
are
the
ladies
of
your
family
kailas
babu
was
spotlessly
neat
in
his
dress
on
all
occasions
though
his
supply
of
clothes
was
sorely
limited
every
day
he
used
to
air
his
shirts
and
vests
and
coats
and
trousers
carefully
and
put
them
out
in
the
sun
along
with
his
his
pillowcase
and
the
small
carpet
on
which
he
always
sat
after
airing
them
he
would
shake
them
and
brush
them
and
put
them
carefully
away
his
little
bits
of
furniture
made
his
small
room
decent
and
hinted
that
there
was
more
in
reserve
if
needed
very
often
for
want
of
a
servant
he
would
shut
up
his
house
for
a
while
then
he
would
iron
out
his
shirts
and
linen
with
his
own
hands
and
do
other
little
menial
tasks
after
this
he
would
open
his
door
and
receive
his
friends
again
though
kailas
babu
as
i
have
said
had
lost
all
his
landed
property
he
had
still
some
family
heirlooms
left
there
was
a
silver
cruet
for
sprinkling
scented
water
a
filigree
box
for
a
small
gold
salver
a
costly
ancient
shawl
and
the
ceremonial
dress
and
ancestral
turban
these
he
had
rescued
with
the
greatest
difficulty
from
the
clutches
on
every
suitable
occasion
he
would
bring
them
out
in
state
and
thus
try
to
save
the
dignity
of
the
babus
of
nayanjore
at
heart
the
most
modest
of
men
in
his
daily
speech
he
regarded
it
as
a
sacred
duty
owed
to
his
rank
to
give
free
play
to
his
family
pride
his
friends
would
encourage
this
trait
in
his
character
with
kindly
and
it
gave
them
great
amusement
the
neighbourhood
soon
learnt
to
call
him
their
thakur
dada
they
would
flock
to
his
house
and
sit
with
him
for
hours
together
to
prevent
his
incurring
any
expense
one
or
other
of
his
friends
would
bring
him
tobacco
and
say
thakur
dada
this
morning
some
tobacco
was
sent
to
me
from
gaya
do
take
it
and
see
how
you
like
it
thakur
dada
would
take
it
and
say
it
was
excellent
he
would
then
go
on
to
tell
of
a
certain
exquisite
tobacco
which
they
once
smoked
in
the
old
days
of
nayanjore
at
the
cost
of
a
guinea
an
ounce
i
wonder
he
used
to
say
if
any
one
would
like
to
try
it
now
i
have
some
left
and
can
get
it
at
once
every
one
knew
that
if
they
asked
for
it
then
somehow
or
other
the
key
of
the
cupboard
would
be
missing
or
else
ganesh
his
old
family
servant
had
put
it
away
somewhere
you
never
can
be
sure
he
would
add
where
things
go
to
when
servants
are
about
now
this
ganesh
of
mine
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
fool
he
is
but
i
have
the
heart
to
dismiss
him
ganesh
for
the
credit
of
the
family
was
quite
ready
to
bear
all
the
blame
without
a
word
one
of
the
company
usually
said
at
this
point
never
mind
thakur
dada
please
do
trouble
to
look
for
it
this
tobacco
we
smoking
will
do
quite
well
the
other
would
be
too
strong
then
thakur
dada
would
be
relieved
and
settle
down
again
and
the
talk
would
go
on
when
his
guests
got
up
to
go
away
thakur
dada
would
accompany
them
to
the
door
and
say
to
them
on
the
oh
by
the
way
when
are
you
all
coming
to
dine
with
me
one
or
other
of
us
would
answer
not
just
yet
thakur
dada
not
just
yet
we
fix
a
day
later
quite
right
he
would
answer
quite
right
we
had
much
better
wait
till
the
rains
come
it
too
hot
now
and
a
grand
rich
dinner
such
as
i
should
want
to
give
you
would
upset
us
in
weather
like
this
but
when
the
rains
did
come
every
one
was
very
careful
not
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
if
the
subject
was
brought
up
some
friend
would
suggest
gently
that
it
was
very
inconvenient
to
get
about
when
the
rains
were
so
severe
and
therefore
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
they
were
over
thus
the
game
went
on
thakur
dada
poor
lodging
was
much
too
small
for
his
position
and
we
used
to
condole
with
him
about
it
his
friends
would
assure
him
they
quite
understood
his
difficulties
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
get
a
decent
house
in
calcutta
indeed
they
had
all
been
looking
out
for
years
for
a
house
to
suit
him
but
i
need
hardly
add
no
friend
had
been
foolish
enough
to
find
one
thakur
dada
used
to
say
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
well
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
put
up
with
this
house
after
all
then
he
would
add
with
a
genial
smile
but
you
know
i
could
never
bear
to
be
away
from
my
friends
i
must
be
near
you
that
really
compensates
for
everything
somehow
i
felt
all
this
very
deeply
indeed
i
suppose
the
real
reason
was
that
when
a
man
is
young
stupidity
appears
to
him
the
worst
of
crimes
kailas
babu
was
not
really
stupid
in
ordinary
business
matters
every
one
was
ready
to
consult
him
but
with
regard
to
nayanjore
his
utterances
were
certainly
void
of
common
sense
because
out
of
amused
affection
for
him
no
one
contradicted
his
impossible
statements
he
refused
to
keep
them
in
bounds
when
people
recounted
in
his
hearing
the
glorious
history
of
nayanjore
with
absurd
exaggerations
he
would
accept
all
they
said
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
never
doubted
even
in
his
dreams
that
any
one
could
disbelieve
it
ii
when
i
sit
down
and
try
to
analyse
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
i
had
towards
kailas
babu
i
see
that
there
was
a
still
deeper
reason
for
my
dislike
i
will
now
explain
though
i
am
the
son
of
a
rich
man
and
might
have
wasted
time
at
college
my
industry
was
such
that
i
took
my
degree
in
calcutta
university
when
quite
young
my
moral
character
was
flawless
in
addition
my
outward
appearance
was
so
handsome
that
if
i
were
to
call
myself
beautiful
it
might
be
thought
a
mark
of
but
could
not
be
considered
an
untruth
there
could
be
no
question
that
among
the
young
men
of
bengal
i
was
regarded
by
parents
generally
as
a
very
eligible
match
i
was
myself
quite
clear
on
the
point
and
had
determined
to
obtain
my
full
value
in
the
marriage
market
when
i
pictured
my
choice
i
had
before
my
eye
a
wealthy
father
only
daughter
extremely
beautiful
and
highly
educated
proposals
came
pouring
in
to
me
from
far
and
near
large
sums
in
cash
were
offered
i
weighed
these
offers
with
rigid
impartiality
in
the
delicate
scales
of
my
own
estimation
but
there
was
no
one
fit
to
be
my
partner
i
became
convinced
with
the
poet
bhabavuti
that
in
this
world
endless
time
and
boundless
space
one
be
born
at
last
to
match
my
sovereign
grace
but
in
this
puny
modern
age
and
this
contracted
space
of
modern
bengal
it
was
doubtful
if
the
peerless
creature
existed
as
yet
meanwhile
my
praises
were
sung
in
many
tunes
and
in
different
metres
by
designing
parents
whether
i
was
pleased
with
their
daughters
or
not
this
worship
which
they
offered
was
never
unpleasing
i
used
to
regard
it
as
my
proper
due
because
i
was
so
good
we
are
told
that
when
the
gods
withhold
their
boons
from
mortals
they
still
expect
their
worshippers
to
pay
them
fervent
honour
and
are
angry
if
it
is
withheld
i
had
that
divine
expectance
strongly
developed
in
myself
i
have
already
mentioned
that
thakur
dada
had
an
only
i
had
seen
her
many
times
but
had
never
mistaken
her
for
beautiful
no
thought
had
ever
entered
my
mind
that
she
would
be
a
possible
partner
for
myself
all
the
same
it
seemed
quite
certain
to
me
that
some
day
or
other
kailas
babu
would
offer
her
with
all
due
worship
as
an
oblation
at
my
shrine
indeed
this
was
the
inner
secret
of
my
dislike
i
was
thoroughly
annoyed
that
he
had
not
done
so
already
i
heard
that
thakur
dada
had
told
his
friends
that
the
babus
of
nayanjore
never
craved
a
boon
even
if
the
girl
remained
unmarried
he
would
not
break
the
family
tradition
it
was
this
arrogance
of
his
that
made
me
angry
my
indignation
smouldered
for
some
time
but
i
remained
perfectly
silent
and
bore
it
with
the
utmost
patience
because
i
was
so
good
as
lightning
accompanies
thunder
so
in
my
character
a
flash
of
humour
was
mingled
with
the
mutterings
of
my
wrath
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
me
to
punish
the
old
man
merely
to
give
vent
to
my
rage
and
for
a
long
time
i
did
nothing
at
all
but
suddenly
one
day
such
an
amusing
plan
came
into
my
head
that
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
carrying
it
into
effect
i
have
already
said
that
many
of
kailas
babu
friends
used
to
flatter
the
old
man
vanity
to
the
full
one
who
was
a
retired
government
servant
had
told
him
that
whenever
he
saw
the
chota
lât
sahib
he
always
asked
for
the
latest
news
about
the
babus
of
nayanjore
and
the
chota
lât
had
been
heard
to
say
that
in
all
bengal
the
only
really
respectable
families
were
those
of
the
maharaja
of
cossipore
and
the
babus
of
nayanjore
when
this
monstrous
falsehood
was
told
to
kailas
babu
he
was
extremely
gratified
and
often
repeated
the
story
and
wherever
after
that
he
met
this
government
servant
in
company
he
would
ask
along
with
other
questions
oh
er
by
the
way
how
is
the
chota
lât
sahib
quite
well
did
you
say
ah
yes
i
am
so
delighted
to
hear
it
and
the
dear
mem
sahib
is
she
quite
well
too
ah
yes
and
the
little
children
are
they
quite
well
also
ah
yes
that
very
good
news
be
sure
and
give
them
my
compliments
when
you
see
them
kailas
babu
would
constantly
express
his
intention
of
going
some
day
and
paying
a
visit
to
the
lord
sahib
but
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
many
chota
lâts
and
burra
lâts
also
would
come
and
go
and
much
water
would
pass
down
the
hoogly
before
the
family
coach
of
nayanjore
would
be
furbished
up
to
pay
a
visit
to
government
house
one
day
i
took
kailas
babu
aside
and
told
him
in
a
whisper
thakur
dada
i
was
at
the
levee
yesterday
and
the
chota
lât
sahib
happened
to
mention
the
babus
of
nayanjore
i
told
him
that
kailas
babu
had
come
to
town
do
you
know
he
was
terribly
hurt
because
you
had
called
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
put
etiquette
on
one
side
and
pay
you
a
private
visit
himself
this
very
afternoon
anybody
else
could
have
seen
through
this
plot
of
mine
in
a
moment
and
if
it
had
been
directed
against
another
person
kailas
babu
would
have
understood
the
joke
but
after
all
that
he
had
heard
from
his
friend
the
government
servant
and
after
all
his
own
exaggerations
a
visit
from
the
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
became
highly
nervous
and
excited
at
my
news
each
detail
of
the
coming
visit
exercised
him
greatly
most
of
all
his
own
ignorance
of
english
how
on
earth
was
that
difficulty
to
be
met
i
told
him
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
it
was
aristocratic
not
to
know
english
and
besides
the
always
brought
an
interpreter
with
him
and
he
had
expressly
mentioned
that
this
visit
was
to
be
private
about
midday
when
most
of
our
neighbours
are
at
work
and
the
rest
are
asleep
a
carriage
and
pair
stopped
before
the
lodging
of
kailas
babu
two
flunkeys
in
livery
came
up
the
stairs
and
announced
in
a
loud
voice
the
chota
lât
sahib
has
arrived
kailas
babu
was
ready
waiting
for
him
in
his
ceremonial
robes
and
ancestral
turban
and
ganesh
was
by
his
side
dressed
in
his
master
best
suit
of
clothes
for
the
occasion
when
the
chota
lât
sahib
was
announced
kailas
babu
ran
panting
and
puffing
and
trembling
to
the
door
and
led
in
a
friend
of
mine
in
disguise
with
repeated
salaams
bowing
low
at
each
step
and
walking
backward
as
best
he
could
he
had
his
old
family
shawl
spread
over
a
hard
wooden
chair
and
he
asked
the
lât
sahib
to
be
seated
he
then
made
a
speech
in
urdu
the
ancient
court
language
of
the
sahibs
and
presented
on
the
golden
salver
a
string
of
gold
the
last
relics
of
his
broken
fortune
the
old
family
servant
ganesh
with
an
expression
of
awe
bordering
on
terror
stood
behind
with
the
drenching
the
lât
sahib
and
touched
him
gingerly
from
time
to
time
with
the
from
the
filigree
box
kailas
babu
repeatedly
expressed
his
regret
at
not
being
able
to
receive
his
honour
bahadur
with
all
the
ancestral
magnificence
of
his
own
family
estate
at
nayanjore
there
he
could
have
welcomed
him
properly
with
due
ceremonial
but
in
calcutta
he
was
a
mere
stranger
and
sojourner
in
fact
a
fish
out
of
water
my
friend
with
his
tall
silk
hat
on
very
gravely
nodded
i
need
hardly
say
that
according
to
english
custom
the
hat
ought
to
have
been
removed
inside
the
room
but
my
friend
did
not
dare
to
take
it
off
for
fear
of
detection
and
kailas
babu
and
his
old
servant
ganesh
were
sublimely
unconscious
of
the
breach
of
etiquette
after
a
ten
minutes
interview
which
consisted
chiefly
of
nodding
the
head
my
friend
rose
to
his
feet
to
depart
the
two
flunkeys
in
livery
as
had
been
planned
beforehand
carried
off
in
state
the
string
of
gold
the
gold
salver
the
old
ancestral
shawl
the
silver
and
the
filigree
box
they
placed
them
ceremoniously
in
the
carriage
kailas
babu
regarded
this
as
the
usual
habit
of
chota
lât
sahibs
i
was
watching
all
the
while
from
the
next
room
my
sides
were
aching
with
suppressed
laughter
when
i
could
hold
myself
in
no
longer
i
rushed
into
a
further
room
suddenly
to
discover
in
a
corner
a
young
girl
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
when
she
saw
my
uproarious
laughter
she
stood
upright
in
passion
flashing
the
lightning
of
her
big
dark
eyes
in
mine
and
said
with
a
voice
tell
me
what
harm
has
my
grandfather
done
to
you
why
have
you
come
to
deceive
him
why
have
you
come
here
why
she
could
say
no
more
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
broke
into
sobs
my
laughter
vanished
in
a
moment
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
anything
but
a
supremely
funny
joke
in
this
act
of
mine
and
here
i
discovered
that
i
had
given
the
cruellest
pain
to
this
tenderest
little
heart
all
the
ugliness
of
my
cruelty
rose
up
to
condemn
me
i
slunk
out
of
the
room
in
silence
like
a
kicked
dog
hitherto
i
had
only
looked
upon
kusum
the
of
kailas
babu
as
a
somewhat
worthless
commodity
in
the
marriage
market
waiting
in
vain
to
attract
a
husband
but
now
i
found
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
in
the
corner
of
that
room
a
human
heart
was
beating
the
whole
night
through
i
had
very
little
sleep
my
mind
was
in
a
tumult
on
the
next
day
very
early
in
the
morning
i
took
all
those
stolen
goods
back
to
kailas
babu
lodgings
wishing
to
hand
them
over
in
secret
to
the
servant
ganesh
i
waited
outside
the
door
and
not
finding
any
one
went
upstairs
to
kailas
babu
room
i
heard
from
the
passage
kusum
asking
her
grandfather
in
the
most
winning
voice
dada
dearest
do
tell
me
all
that
the
chota
lât
sahib
said
to
you
yesterday
do
leave
out
a
single
word
i
am
dying
to
hear
it
all
over
again
and
dada
needed
no
encouragement
his
face
beamed
over
with
pride
as
he
related
all
manner
of
praises
which
the
lât
sahib
had
been
good
enough
to
utter
concerning
the
ancient
families
of
nayanjore
the
girl
was
seated
before
him
looking
up
into
his
face
and
listening
with
rapt
attention
she
was
determined
out
of
love
for
the
old
man
to
play
her
part
to
the
full
my
heart
was
deeply
touched
and
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
stood
there
in
silence
in
the
passage
while
thakur
dada
finished
all
his
embellishments
of
the
chota
lât
sahib
wonderful
visit
when
he
left
the
room
at
last
i
took
the
stolen
goods
and
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
the
girl
and
came
away
without
a
word
later
in
the
day
i
called
again
to
see
kailas
babu
himself
according
to
our
ugly
modern
custom
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
making
no
greeting
at
all
to
this
old
man
when
i
came
into
the
room
but
on
this
day
i
made
a
low
bow
and
touched
his
feet
i
am
convinced
the
old
man
thought
that
the
coming
of
the
chota
lât
sahib
to
his
house
was
the
cause
of
my
new
politeness
he
was
highly
gratified
by
it
and
an
air
of
benign
serenity
shone
from
his
eyes
his
friends
had
looked
in
and
he
had
already
begun
to
tell
again
at
full
length
the
story
of
the
visit
with
still
further
adornments
of
a
most
fantastic
kind
the
interview
was
already
becoming
an
epic
both
in
quality
and
in
length
when
the
other
visitors
had
taken
their
leave
i
made
my
proposal
to
the
old
man
in
a
humble
manner
i
told
him
that
though
i
could
never
for
a
moment
hope
to
be
worthy
of
marriage
connection
with
such
an
illustrious
family
yet
etc
etc
when
i
made
clear
my
proposal
of
marriage
the
old
man
embraced
me
and
broke
out
in
a
tumult
of
joy
i
am
a
poor
man
and
could
never
have
expected
such
great
good
fortune
that
was
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
that
kailas
babu
confessed
to
being
poor
it
was
also
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
that
he
forgot
if
only
for
a
single
moment
the
ancestral
dignity
that
belongs
to
the
babus
of
nayanjore
words
to
be
studied
this
method
of
forming
compound
words
from
two
original
english
words
should
be
studied
compare
the
following
words
which
have
land
for
one
of
their
parts
when
the
second
word
is
not
very
closely
attached
to
the
first
word
a
hyphen
is
put
between
thus
from
the
latin
stinguere
to
quench
compare
this
word
is
the
same
as
check
only
in
this
case
the
original
french
form
has
been
kept
the
verb
to
check
came
into
english
originally
from
the
game
of
chess
in
eastern
lands
when
the
chess
king
was
in
danger
the
word
shah
was
called
out
and
when
the
chess
king
could
not
move
shah
mata
these
were
corrupted
into
check
and
checkmate
this
word
is
a
curious
mixture
of
the
old
french
banque
compare
and
the
latin
rumpere
to
break
compare
it
is
thus
a
hybrid
word
in
modern
english
from
two
latin
words
filum
a
thread
and
granum
a
grain
a
corruption
of
attar
the
word
is
originally
arabic
and
persian
this
word
has
now
taken
its
place
in
most
of
the
european
languages
it
has
come
to
europe
from
the
turkish
tulbend
and
the
persian
dulband
this
word
came
originally
from
central
america
it
was
brought
to
europe
by
the
spaniards
who
pronounced
it
tabaco
it
has
now
travelled
all
round
the
world
and
has
gained
a
place
in
all
the
indian
vernaculars
as
well
as
in
the
further
east
the
old
english
word
ben
meant
a
prayer
and
this
was
the
original
meaning
of
boon
but
a
new
word
appeared
in
english
viz
the
adjective
boon
from
the
french
bon
meaning
good
compare
this
influenced
the
earlier
word
which
thus
gained
its
present
meaning
of
a
blessing
or
gift
smolder
is
an
old
english
word
meaning
smoke
cognate
words
in
english
are
and
which
come
from
the
same
root
the
origin
of
this
word
is
very
doubtful
some
connect
it
with
ging
or
gang
meaning
to
go
others
with
meaning
gentle
or
graceful
the
word
has
no
relation
to
ginger
which
is
an
eastern
word
coming
originally
from
the
sanskrit
and
the
hindustani
from
the
greek
phainō

short
stories

has
been
often
translated
the
present
translation
is
by
the
late
sister
nivedita
and
her
simple
vivid
style
should
be
noticed
by
the
indian
student
reader
it
is
a
good
example
of
modern
english
with
its
short
sentences
its
careful
choice
of
words
and
its
luminous
clearness
of
meaning
a
man
from
cabul
or
kabul
the
capital
of
afghanistan
like
a
ship
putting
out
to
sea
on
a
new
voyage
mini
attendant
rabindranath
tagore
pictures
himself
as
engaged
in
writing
a
novel
full
of
wild
adventures
these
names
are
made
up
to
suit
the
story
the
writer
amusingly
imagines
the
hero
and
heroine
actually
swinging
by
the
rope
until
he
can
get
back
to
his
desk
and
finish
writing
about
how
they
escaped
the
amir
of
kabul

question
about
guarding
the
of
india
against

done
this

a
pleasant

used
instead
of
the
unpleasant
word

during
the
hot
weather
the

of
ancient

of

to
say
he
would

to
this
is
an
english
idiom
like

means
to
begin
just
as
the
conjurer
makes
all
kinds
of
things
appear
before
the
eyes
vegetables
are
rooted
to
the
ground
so
rabindranath
is
rooted
to
his
desk
and
can
not
make
long
journeys
it
was
because
there
was
no
actual
reason
for
it
indefinite
here
means
vague
the

the
this
is
a
brief
way
of
saying
forbid
the
man

this
word
is
made
up
for
the
occasion
and
means
laden
with
bags
compare
the
words
bedewed
besmeared
the
word
just
has
become
very
commonly
used
in
modern
english
it
means
exactly
merely
or
at
the
very
moment
compare
he
had
just
gone
out
it
was
just
a
joke
on
speaking
rabindranath
tagore
is
here
making
a
joke
not

means

become
so
eager
to
talk
with
her
girl
friends
that
she
had
almost
neglected
her
father
the
durga
festival
in
bengal
is
supposed
to
represent
the
time
when
parvati
or
durga
left
her
father
home
in
the
himalayas
called
kailas
and
went
to
live

the
glass
ornamental
hangings
on
which
candles
were

great
houses
at
weddings
it
was
not
considered
a
good
omen
or
good
fortune
to
meet
a
criminal
on
a
wedding
day
used
up
another
allusion
to
the
goddess
durga
and
her
home
in
the
himalayas
this
word
comes
from
the
same
root
as
the
word
to
appear
it
means
a
sudden
or
strange
sight
it
often
means
a
ghost
mini
had
so
changed
that
when
she
appeared
in
her
wedding
dress
she
startled
him
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
friends
with
her
his
own
daughter
would
not
know
him
at
first
before
him
the
barren
his
memory
was
so
strong
that
it
made
him
forget
the
crowded
calcutta
street
and
think
of
his
home
in
the
mountains
the
one
seconded
the
all
were
so
eagerly
in
favour
that
they
wanted
to
speak
at
once
in
support
of
it
his
position
as
a
king
of
the
other
boys
full
of
inventions
and
plans
a
french
word
meaning
a
plan
of
battle
of

would
feel
himself
disgraced
if
he
gave

earth
is
here
pictured
as
a
person
there
is
a
story
of
a
giant
who
gained
fresh
power
every
time
his
body
touched
the
earth
which
was
his
mother
these
were
supposed
to
be
certain
demons
who
pursued
guilty
men
with
loud
cries
servant
was
notice
the
play
of
words
here
the
servant
and
master
change
places
at
this
exact
moment
when
things
were
so
dangerous
the
usual
bengal
word
for
brother
love
was
this
is
a
mild
way
of
saying
that
they
disliked
one
another
pins
and
exceedingly
restless
like
some
one
standing
on
sharp
points
the
phrase
is
a
mock
legal
one
meaning
for
all
time
no
means
she
was
very
displeased
because
she
had
already
children
of
her
own
in
english
a
phrase
is
often
put
in
a
negative
way
to
imply
a
very
strong
positive
statement
thus
by
no
means
happy
may
mean
very
unhappy
such
an
doing
such
an
unwise
thing
a
mock
humorous
expression
meaning
very
quickly
for
wishes
to
be
noticed
and
loved
just
as
a
young
animal
clings
to
its
mother
for
protection
the
phrase
repeats
in
another
form
what
was
said
before
in
the
words
a
kind
of
physical
love
her
drew
her
lips
tight
like
the
mouth
of
a
purse
which
is
tightened
by
pulling
the
string
if
expecting
some
he
was
looking
for
his
mother
very
dangerous
the
danger
point
of
the
illness
might
be
reached
at
any
moment
and
death
might
come
the
when
a
shallow
place
comes
at
sea
or
on
a
great
river
one
of
the
sailors
throws
a
piece
of
lead
with
a
string
tied
to
it
into
the
water
and
then
looks
at
the
on
the
string
he
calls
out
that
the
depth
is
three
or
four
fathoms
according
to
the
mark
the
line
with
a
lead
weight
to
plumb
is
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
a
piece
of
water
here
phatik
is
pictured
as
himself
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
sea
of
death
which
none
can
fathom
the
bengali
word
for
holiday
means
also
release
it
is
as
though
he
were
saying
my
release
has
come
this
can
not
be
represented
in
the
english
once
there
was
a
king
in
this
story
rabindranath
tagore
begins
with
some
amusing
sentences
about
the
dull
matter
of
fact
character
of
modern
scientific
people
who
can
not
enjoy
a
fairy
story
without
asking
is
it
true
the
poet
implies
that
there
are
deeper
truths
than
modern
science
has
yet
discovered
the
ending
of
the
present
story
will
show
this
more
clearly
there
is
a
play
upon
the
word
sovereign
which
can
mean
kingly
and
also
supreme
there
is
further
play
here
with
the
words
exact
and
exacting
exact
means
precise
and
exacting
means
making
others
precise
the
ancient
legends
are
very
obscure
just
like
an
object
seen
through
a
mist
mere
book
knowledge
knowledge
of
outside
things
inner
truth
such
as
comes
from
the
heart
of
man
and
can
not
be
reasoned
or
disputed
past
the
time
when
his
tutor
was
due
other
as
if
god
would
continue
the
rain
merely
to
keep
his
tutor
away
though
it
might
not
have
been
caused
by
his
prayers
still
for
some
reason
the
rain
did
continue
did
my
supply
the
words
give
up
to
fit
the
an
amusing
reference
to
the
doctrine
of
which
states
that
each
deed
will
have
its
due
reward
or
punishment
strictly
speaking
it
should
be
i
not
me
but
he
is
writing
not
too
strictly
hope
no
the
author
here
amusingly
pretends
that
the
child
way
of
getting
out
of
his
lessons
was
too
shocking
for
young
boys
in
the
junior
school
to
read
about
will
marry
my
daughter
to
the
verb
to
marry
in
english
can
be
used
in
two
senses
to
wed
some
one
to
take
in
marriage
to
get
some
one
wedded
to
give
in
marriage
the
later
sense
is
used
here
the
dawn
of
some
indefinite
in
some
past
existence

rabindranath
returns
to
his
mocking
humour
a
modern
author
he
says
would
be
obliged
to
explain
all
sorts
of
details
in
the
story
and
this
is
a
phrase
used
for
the
noise
and
bustle
that
is
made
when
people
are
searching
for
a
thief
referring
back
to
the
grandmother
an
underhand
under
the
disguise
of
a
fairy
story
that
is
in
the
old
conditions
when
people
were
not
too
exacting
about
accuracy
a
humorous
way
of
referring
to
himself
the
author
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
in
the
modern
age
of
science
the
word
wings
is
here
used
not
for
wings
like
those
of
birds
but
for
the
sides
of
a
large
building
projecting
out
at
an
angle
from
the
main
building
what
is
the
use
the
author
here
breaks
off
the
story
as
though
it
were
useless
to
go
on
any
further
in
these
modern
days
when
every
thing
has
to

that

sweetly
smiling

out
at

to
come
rolling
and
surging
in

nature
with
her
full
tide

seems
troubled
and
longing
to
break
out
into

to
the

himself

wields
such
mighty
powers

refusal
