but
ye
are
wise
and
ye
know
what
the
jest
is
worth
general
summary
we
are
very
slightly
changed
from
the
who
ranged
india
prehistoric
clay
whoso
drew
the
longest
bow
ran
his
brother
down
you
know
as
we
run
men
down
today
dowb
the
first
of
all
his
race
met
the
mammoth
face
to
face
on
the
lake
or
in
the
cave
stole
the
steadiest
canoe
ate
the
quarry
others
slew
died
and
took
the
finest
grave
when
they
scratched
the
someone
made
the
sketch
his
own
filched
it
from
the
artist
then
even
in
those
early
days
won
a
simple
viceroy
praise
through
the
toil
of
other
men
ere
they
hewed
the
sphinx
visage
favoritism
governed
kissage
even
as
it
does
in
this
age
who
shall
doubt
the
secret
hid
under
cheops
pyramid
was
that
the
contractor
did
cheops
out
of
several
millions
or
that
joseph
sudden
rise
to
comptroller
of
supplies
was
a
fraud
of
monstrous
size
on
king
pharoah
swart
civilians
thus
the
artless
songs
i
sing
do
not
deal
with
anything
new
or
never
said
before
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
today
official
sinning
and
shall
be
forevermore
army
headquarters
old
is
the
song
that
i
sing
old
as
my
unpaid
bills
old
as
the
chicken
that
kitmutgars
bring
men
at
old
as

ahasuerus
jenkins
of
the
operatic
own
was
dowered
with
a
tenor
voice
of
tone
his
views
on
equitation
were
perhaps
a
trifle
queer
he
had
no
seat
worth
mentioning
but
oh
he
had
an
ear
he
clubbed
his
wretched
company
a
dozen
times
a
day
he
used
to
quit
his
charger
in
a
parabolic
way
his
method
of
saluting
was
the
joy
of
all
beholders
but
ahasuerus
jenkins
had
a
head
upon
his
shoulders
he
took
two
months
to
simla
when
the
year
was
at
the
spring
and
underneath
the
deodars
eternally
did
sing
he
warbled
like
a
bulbul
but
particularly
at
cornelia
agrippina
who
was
musical
and
fat
she
controlled
a
humble
husband
who
in
turn
controlled
a
where
cornelia
agrippina
human
were
kept
from
april
to
october
on
a
plump
retaining
fee
supplied
of
course
per
mensem
by
the
indian
treasury
cornelia
used
to
sing
with
him
and
jenkins
used
to
play
he
praised
unblushingly
her
notes
for
he
was
false
as
they
so
when
the
winds
of
april
turned
the
budding
roses
brown
cornelia
told
her
husband
tom
you
must
send
him
they
haled
him
from
his
regiment
which
did
much
regret
him
they
found
for
him
an
and
on
that
stool
they
set
him
to
play
with
maps
and
catalogues
three
idle
hours
a
day
and
draw
his
plump
retaining
fee
which
means
his
double
pay
now
ever
after
dinner
when
the
coffeecups
are
brought
ahasuerus
waileth
the
grand
pianoforte
and
thanks
to
fair
cornelia
his
fame
hath
waxen
great

ahasuerus
jenkins
is
a
power
in
the
state
study
of
an
elevation
in
indian
ink
this
ditty
is
a
string
of
lies
but
how
the
deuce
did
gubbins
rise
potiphar
gubbins
stands
at
the
top
of
the
tree
and
i
muse
in
my
bed
on
the
reasons
that
led
to
the
hoisting
of
potiphar
potiphar
gubbins
is
seven
years
junior
to
me
each
bridge
that
he
makes
he
either
buckles
or
breaks
and
his
work
is
as
rough
as
he
potiphar
gubbins
is
coarse
as
a
chimpanzee
and
i
ca
understand
why
you
gave
him
your
hand
lovely
mehitabel
lee
potiphar
gubbins
is
dear
to
the
powers
that
be
for
they
bow
and
they
smile
in
an
affable
style
which
is
seldom
accorded
to
me
potiphar
gubbins
is
certain
as
certain
can
be
of
a
post
which
is
claimed
by
a
host
of
seniors
including
me
careless
and
lazy
is
he
greatly
inferior
to
me
what
is
the
spell
that
you
manage
so
well
commonplace
potiphar
lovely
mehitabel

let
me
inquire
of
thee
should
i
have

thou

mated

strange

half
a
dozen
englishmen

the

a
future
fine

nothing
more

things
were
lively
for
a
week
in
the
state

even
now
the
people
speak
of
that
time
regretfully

the
story
of
uriah
now
there
were
two
men
in
one
city
the
one
rich
and
the
other
jack
barrett
went
to
quetta
because
they
told
him
to
he
left
his
wife
at
simla
on
his
monthly
screw
jack
barrett
died
at
quetta
ere
the
next
month
pay
he
drew
jack
barrett
went
to
quetta
he
did
understand
the
reason
of
his
transfer
from
the
pleasant
the
season
was
september
and
it
killed
him
out
of
hand
jack
barrett
went
to
quetta
and
there
gave
up
the
ghost
attempting
two
men
duty
in
that
very
healthy
post
and
barrett
mourned
for
him
five
lively
months
at
most
jack
barrett
bones
at
quetta
enjoy
profound
repose
but
i
should
be
astonished
if
now
his
spirit
knows
the
reason
of
his
transfer
from
the
himalayan
snows
and
when
the
last
great
bugle
call
adown
the
hurnal
throbs
when
the
last
grim
joke
is
entered
in
the
big
black
book
of
jobs
and
quetta
graveyards
give
again
their
victims
to
the
air
i
should
like
to
be
the
man
who
sent
jack
barrett
there
the
post
that
fitted
though
tangled
and
twisted
the
course
of
true
love
this
ditty
explains
no
tangle
so
tangled
it
can
not
improve
if
the
lover
has
brains
ere
the
steamer
bore
him
eastward
sleary
was
engaged
to
marry
an
attractive
girl
at
tunbridge
whom
he
called
my
little
sleary
pay
was
very
modest
sleary
was
the
other
way
who
can
cook
a
dinner
on
eight
poor
rupees
a
day
long
he
pondered
the
question
in
his
scantly
furnished
quarters
then
proposed
to
minnie
boffkin
eldest
of
judge
boffkin
daughters
certainly
an
impecunious
subaltern
was
not
a
catch
but
the
boffkins
knew
that
minnie
might
make
another
match
so
they
recognised
the
business
and
to
feed
and
clothe
the
bride
got
him
made
a
something
something
somewhere
on
the
bombay
side
anyhow
the
billet
carried
pay
enough
for
him
to
marry
as
the
artless
sleary
put
it
just
the
thing
for
me
and
did
he
therefore
jilt
miss
boffkin
impulse
of
a
baser
mind
no
he
started
epileptic
fits
of
an
appalling
kind
of
his
modus
operandi
only

could
gather
pears

sticks
will
give
you
little
taste
and
lots
of

places
his
affliction
used
to
smite
sleary
with
distressing
vigour
always
in
the
boffkins
sight
ere
a
week
was
over
minnie
weepingly
returned
his
ring
told
him
his
unhappy
weakness
stopped
all
thought
of
marrying

his
list
to
a
ditty
queer
the
sale
of
a
bought
like
a
bullock
hoof
and
hide
by
the
little
tin
gods
on
the
mountain
side
by
the
laws
of
the
family
circle
is
written
in
letters
of
brass
that
only
a
colonel
from
chatham
can
manage
the
railways
of
state
because
of
the
gold
on
his
breeks
and
the
subjects
wherein
he
must
pass
because
in
all
matters
that
deal
not
with
railways
his
knowledge
is
great
now
exeter
battleby
tring
had
laboured
from
boyhood
to
eld
on
the
lines
of
the
east
and
the
west
and
eke
of
the
north
and
south
many
lines
had
he
built
and
surveyed
important
the
posts
which
he
held
and
the
lords
of
the
iron
horse
were
dumb
when
he
opened
his
mouth
black
as
the
raven
his
garb
and
his
heresies
jettier
still
hinting
that
railways
required
lifetimes
of
study
and
knowledge
never
clanked
sword
by
his
side
vauban
he
knew
not
nor
drill
nor
was
his
name
on
the
list
of
the
men
who
had
passed
through
the
wherefore
the
little
tin
gods
harried
their
little
tin
souls
seeing
he
came
not
from
chatham
jingled
no
spurs
at
his
heels
knowing
that
nevertheless
was
he
first
on
the
government
rolls
for
the
billet
of
railway
instructor
to
little
tin
gods
on
letters
not
seldom
they
wrote
him
having
the
honour
to
state
it
would
be
better
for
all
men
if
he
were
laid
on
the
shelf
much
would
accrue
to
his
an
he
consented
to
wait
until
the
little
tin
gods
built
him
a
berth
for
himself
special
well
paid
and
exempt
from
the
law
of
the
fifty
and
five
even
to
ninety
and
nine
these
were
the
terms
of
the
pact
thus
did
the
little
tin
gods
long
may
their
highnesses
thrive
silence
his
mouth
with
rupees
keeping
their
circle
intact
appointing
a
colonel
from
chatham
who
managed
the
bhamo
state
line
the
which
was
one
mile
and
one
furlong
a
guaranteed
gauge
so
exeter

consented
his
claims
to
resign
and
died
on
four
thousand

ninetieth

age

viceroy
now
those
days
are
dead
and
done

delilah

and
depraved
ulysses
gunne
delilah
aberyswith
was
a
lady
not
too
young
with
a
perfect
taste
in
dresses
and
a
tongue
with
a
thirst
for
information
and
a
greater
thirst
for
praise
and
a
little
house
in
simla
in
the
prehistoric
days
by
reason
of
her
marriage
to
a
gentleman
in
power
delilah
was
acquainted
with
the
gossip
of
the
hour
and
many
little
secrets
of
the
kind
were
whispered
to
delilah
and
she
bore
them
all
in
mind
she
patronized
extensively
a
man
ulysses
gunne
whose
mode
of
earning
money
was
a
low
and
shameful
one
he
wrote
for
certain
papers
which
as
everybody
knows
is
worse
than
serving
in
a
shop
or
scaring
off
the
crows
he
praised
her
queenly
beauty
first
and
later
on
he
hinted
at
the
vastness
of
her
intellect
with
compliment
unstinted
he
went
with
her
and
his
love
for
her
was
such
that
he
lent
her
all
his
horses
and
she
galled
them
very
much
one
day
they
brewed
a
secret
of
a
fine
financial
sort
it
related
to
appointments
to
a
man
and
a
report
was
almost
worth
the
keeping
only
seven
people
knew
it
and
gunne
rose
up
to
seek
the
truth
and
patiently
pursue
it
it
was
a
viceroy
secret
but
perhaps
the
wine
was
red
perhaps
an
aged
councillor
had
lost
his
aged
head
perhaps
delilah
eyes
were
bright
delilah
whispers
sweet
the
aged
member
told
her
what
treason
to
repeat
ulysses
went
and
they
talked
of
love
and
flowers
ulysses
went
and
he
called
for
several
hours
ulysses
went
and
delilah
helped
him
dance
ulysses
let
the
waltzes
go
and
waited
for
his
chance
the
summer
sun
was
setting
and
the
summer
air
was
still
the
couple
went
in
the
shade
of
summer
hill
the
wasteful
sunset
faded
out
in
and
gold
ulysses
pleaded
softly
and
that
bad
delilah
told
next
morn
a
startled
empire
learnt
the
news
next
week
the
aged
councillor
was
shaking
in
his
shoes
next
month
i
met
delilah
and
she
did
not
show
the
least
hesitation
in
affirming
that
ulysses
was

his

jenny
and
me
were
engaged
you
see
on
the
eve
of
the
fancy
ball
so
a
kiss
or
two
was
nothing
to
you
or
any
one
else
at
all
jenny
would
go
in
a
domino
pretty
and
pink
but
warm
while
i
attended
clad
in
a
splendid
austrian
uniform
now
we
had
arranged
through
notes
exchanged
early
that
afternoon
at
number
four
to
waltz
no
more
but
to
sit
in
the
dusk
and
spoon
i
wish
you
to
see
that
jenny
and
me
had
barely
exchanged
our
troth
so
a
kiss
or
two
was
strictly
due
by
from
and
between
us
both
when
three
was
over
an
eager
lover
i
fled
to
the
gloom
outside
and
a
domino
came
out
also
whom
i
took
for
my
future
bride
that
is
to
say
in
a
casual
way
i
slipped
my
arm
around
her
with
a
kiss
or
two
which
is
nothing
to
you
and
ready
to
kiss
i
found
her
she
turned
her
head
and
the
name
she
said
was
certainly
not
my
own
but
ere
i
could
speak
with
a
smothered
shriek
she
fled
and
left
me
alone
then
jenny
came
and
i
saw
with
shame
she
doffed
her
domino
and
i
had
embraced
an
alien
waist
but
i
did
not
tell
her
so
next
morn
i
knew
that
there
were
two
dominoes
pink
and
one
had
cloaked
the
spouse
of
sir
julian
house
our
big
political
gun
sir
was
old
and
her
hair
was
gold
and
her
eye
was
a
blue
cerulean
and
the
name
she
said
when
she
turned
her
head
was
not
in
the
least
like
the
man
who
could
write
shun
shun
the
bowl
that
fatal
facile
drink
has
ruined
many
geese
who
dipped
their
quills
in
bribe
murder

but
steer
clear
of
ink
save
when
you
write
receipts
for
bills
in
there
may
be
silver
in
the
all
i
know
of
is
the
iron
and
the
gall
boanerges
blitzen
servant
of
the
queen
is
a
dismal
failure
is
a
in
a
luckless
moment
he
discovered
men
rise
to
high
position
through
a
ready
pen
boanerges
blitzen
argued
therefore
i
with
the
selfsame
weapon
can
attain
as
only
he
did
not
possess
when
he
made
the
trial
wicked
wit
of
irony
of
l
men
who
spar
with
government
need
to
back
their
blows
something
more
than
ordinary
journalistic
prose
never
young
civilian
prospects
were
so
bright
till
an
indian
paper
found
that
he
could
write
never
young
civilian
prospects
were
so
dark
when
the
wretched
blitzen
wrote
to
make
his
mark
certainly
he
scored
it
bold
and
black
and
firm
in
that
indian
paper
made
his
seniors
squirm
quoted
office
scandals
wrote
the
tactless
truth
was
there
ever
known
a
more
misguided
youth
when
the
rag
he
wrote
for
praised
his
plucky
game
boanerges
blitzen
felt
that
this
was
fame
when
the
men
he
wrote
of
shook
their
heads
and
swore
boanerges
blitzen
only
wrote
the
more
posed
as
young
ithuriel
resolute
and
grim
till
he
found
promotion
did
come
to
him
till
he
found
that
reprimands
weekly
were
his
lot
and
his
many
districts
curiously
hot
till
he
found
his
furlough
strangely
hard
to
win
boanerges
blitzen
did
care
to
pin
then
it
seemed
to
dawn
on
him
something
was
right
boanerges
blitzen
put
it
down
to
spite
languished
in
a
district
desolate
and
dry
watched
the
local
government
yearly
pass
him
by
wondered
where
the
hitch
was
called
it
most
unfair
that
was
seven
years
ago
and
he
still
is
there
municipal
why
is
my
district
low
said
binks
of
hezabad
well
drains
and
are
my
own
peculiar
fad
i
learnt
a
lesson
once
it
ran
thus
quoth
that
most
veracious
man
it
was
an
august
evening
and
in
snowy
garments
clad
i
paid
a
round
of
visits
in
the
lines
of
hezabad
when
presently
my
waler
saw
and
did
not
like
at
all
a
commissariat
elephant
careering
down
the
mall
i
could
see
the
driver
and
across
my
mind
it
rushed
that
that
commissariat
elephant
had
suddenly
gone
musth
i
did
care
to
meet
him
and
i
could
well
get
down
so
i
let
the
waler
have
it
and
we
headed
for
the
town
the
buggy
was
a
new
one
and
praise
dykes
it
stood
the
strain
till
the
waler
jumped
a
bullock
just
above
the
city
drain
and
the
next
that
i
remember
was
a
hurricane
of
squeals
and
the
creature
making
toothpicks
of
my
patent
wheels
he
seemed
to
want
the
owner
so
i
fled
distraught
with
fear
to
the
main
drain
while
he
snorted
in
my
ear
reached
the
safely
and
in
darkness
and
despair
felt
the
brute
proboscis
fingering
my
hair
heard
it
trumpet
on
my
shoulder
tried
to
crawl
a
little
higher
found
the
main
drain
sewage
outfall
blocked
some
eight
feet
up
with
mire
and
for
twenty
reeking
minutes
sir
my
very
marrow
froze
while
the
trunk
was
feeling
blindly
for
a
purchase
on
my
toes
it
missed
me
by
a
fraction
but
my
hair
was
turning
grey
before
they
called
the
drivers
up
and
dragged
the
brute
away
then
i
sought
the
city
elders
and
my
words
were
very
plain
they
flushed
that
and
it
never
choked
again
you
may
hold
with
and
the
cure
till
you
been
a
periwinkle
shrinking
coyly
up
a
sewer
i
believe
in
culverts
this
is
why
the
small
and
if
you
do
believe
me
get
shikarred
yourself
that
all
a
code
of
morals
lest
you
should
think
this
story
true
i
merely
mention
i
evolved
it
lately
is
a
most
unmitigated
misstatement
now
jones
had
left
his
bride
to
keep
his
house
in
order
and
hied
away
to
the
hurrum
hills
above
the
afghan
border
to
sit
on
a
rock
with
a
heliograph
but
ere
he
left
he
taught
his
wife
the
working
of
the
code
that
sets
the
miles
at
naught
and
love
had
made
him
very
sage
as
nature
made
her
fair
so
cupid
and
apollo
linked
per
heliograph
the
pair
at
dawn
across
the
hurrum
hills
he
flashed
her
counsel
wise
at
the
dying
sunset
bore
her
husband
homilies
he
warned
her
seductive
youths
in
scarlet
clad
and
gold
as
much
as
the
blandishments
paternal
of
the
old
but
kept
his
gravest
warnings
for
hereby
the
ditty
hangs
that
lothario
bangs
was
general
bangs
with
aide
and
staff
who
tittupped
on
the
way
when
they
beheld
a
heliograph
tempestuously
at
play
they
thought
of
border
risings
and
of
stations
sacked
and
burnt
so
stopped
to
take
the
message
down
and
this
is
what
they
learnt

they
booked
that

from

a

he
flashed
her
counsel

but
howsoever
love
be
blind
the
world
at
large
hath

with
damnatory
dot

he
heliographed
his

some
interesting
details
of
the
general
private
life
the
artless
was
mute
the
shining
staff
were
still

red

ever

grew

this
is

at

his

i

we
tapped

the

is

at

the

the

the

told
to
me
was
fultah
fisher
where
reside
and
there
were
men
of
all
the
ports
from
mississip
to
clyde
and
regally
they
spat
and
smoked
and
fearsomely
they
lied
they
lied
about
the
purple
sea
that
gave
them
scanty
bread
they
lied
about
the
earth
beneath
the
heavens
overhead
for
they
had
looked
too
often
on
black
rum
when
that
was
red
they
told
their
tales
of
wreck
and
wrong
of
shame
and
lust
and
fraud
they
backed
their
toughest
statements
with
the
brimstone
of
the
lord
and
crackling
oaths
went
to
and
fro
across
the
board
and
there
was
hans
the

bare
of

who
carried
on
his
hairy
chest
the
maid
ultruda
charm
the
little
silver
crucifix
that
keeps
a

and
there
was
jake

pamba
the

the

and
luz

then
the

began
an
oath
from

a
shriek
upon

stairs
a
dance
of

on

a
unawares
and

hans

anne

looted
first
the

the

silver
crucifix
that
keeps
a

from

as
the
bell
clinks
as
i
left
the
halls
at
lumley
rose
the
vision
of
a
comely
maid
last
season
worshipped
dumbly
watched
with
fervor
from
afar
and
i
wondered
idly
blindly
if
the
maid
would
greet
me
kindly
that
was
all
the
rest
was
settled
by
the
clinking
yea
my
life
and
hers
were
coupled
by
the
tonga
for
my
misty
meditation
at
the
second
suffered
sudden
dislocation
fled
before
the
tuneless
jar
of
a
wagner
obbligato
scherzo
doublehand
staccato
played
on
either
pony
saddle
by
the
clacking
played
with
human
speech
i
fancied
by
the
jigging
jolting
bar
she
was
sweet
thought
i
last
season
but
surely
wild
unreason
such
tiny
hope
to
freeze
on
as
was
offered
by
my
star
when
she
whispered
something
sadly
we
feel
your
going
badly
and
you
let
the
chance
escape
you
rapped
the
rattling
what
a
chance
and
what
an
idiot
clicked
the
vicious
heart
of
man
oh
heart
of
putty
had
i
gone
by
kakahutti
on
the
old
and
rutty
i
had
that
fatal
car
but
his
fortune
each
must
bide
by
so
i
watched
the
milestones
slide
by
to
you
call
on
her
tomorrow
fugue
with
cymbals
by
the
bar
you
must
call
on
her
tomorrow
gallop
by
the
bar
yet
a
further
stage
my
goal
on
we
were
whirling
down
to
solon
with
a
double
lurch
and
roll
on
best
foot
foremost
ganz
und
gar
she
was
very
sweet
i
hinted
if
a
kiss
had
been
imprinted
ha
saved
a
world
of
trouble
clashed
the
busy
accepted
or
rejected
banged
and
clanged
the
then
a
notion
wild
and
daring
the
income
tax
paring
and
a
hasty
thought
of
sharing
less
than

watch
your

maggie
is

the

the

there

smile
which
is
the

portion
bondage
bought
with
a

dusky
beauties
fifty
tied
in

counsellors
cunning
and
silent
comforters
true
and
tried
and
never
a

at

in

solace
in

in

only
a

shall
envy
who
read
of
the
tale
of
my

for
maggie
has
written
a
letter
to
give
me
my
choice
between
the
wee
little
whimpering
love
and
the
great
god
nick
o
teen
and
i
have
been
servant
of
love
for
barely
a
twelvemonth
clear
but
i
have
been
priest
of
cabanas
a
matter
of
seven
year
and
the
gloom
of
my
bachelor
days
is
flecked
with
the
cheery
light
of
stumps
that
i
burned
to
friendship
and
pleasure
and
work
and
fight
and
i
turn
my
eyes
to
the
future
that
maggie
and
i
must
prove
but
the
only
light
on
the
marshes
is
the
of
love
will
it
see
me
safe
through
my
journey
or
leave
me
bogged
in
the
mire
since
a
puff
of
tobacco
can
cloud
it
shall
i
follow
the
fitful
fire
open
the

let
me
consider
anew
old
friends
and
who
is
maggie
that
i
should
abandon
you
a
million
surplus
maggies
are
willing
to
bear
the

a

a

of
two
cities
where
the
cultivator
smiles
on
his
byles
where
the
cholera
the
cyclone
and
the
crow
come
and
go
where
the
merchant
deals
in
indigo
and
tea
hides
and
ghi
where
the
babu
drops
inflammatory
hints
in
his
prints
stands
a
city
charnock
chose
it
packed
away
near
a
bay
by
the
sewage
rendered
fetid
by
the
sewer
made
impure
by
the
sunderbunds
unwholesome
by
the
swamp
moist
and
damp
and
the
city
and
the
viceroy
as
we
see
do
agree
once
two
hundred
years
ago
the
trader
came
meek
and
tame
where
his
timid
foot
first
halted
there
he
stayed
till
mere
trade
grew
to
empire
and
he
sent
his
armies
forth
south
and
north
till
the
country
from
peshawur
to
ceylon
was
his
own
thus
the
midday
halt
of
charnock
more
the
pity
grew
a
city
as
the
fungus
sprouts
chaotic
from
its
bed
so
it
spread
laid
and
built
on
the
silt
palace
byre
hovel
poverty
and
pride
side
by
side
and
above
the
packed
and
pestilential
town
death
looked
down
but
the
rulers
in
that
city
by
the
sea
turned
to
flee
fled
with
each
returning
from
its
ills
to
the
hills
from
the
clammy
fogs
of
morning
from
the
blaze
of
old
days
from
the
sickness
of
the
noontide
from
the
heat
beat
retreat
for
the
country
from
peshawur
to
ceylon
was
their
own
but
the
merchant
risked
the
perils
of
the
plain
for
his
gain
now
the
of
charnock
the
palms
asks
an
alms
and
the
burden
of
its
lamentation
is
briefly
this
because
for
certain
months
we
boil
and
stew
so
should
you
cast
the
viceroy
and
his
council
to
perspire
in
our
fire
and
for
answer
to
the
argument
in
vain
we
explain
that
an
amateur
saint
lawrence
can
not
fry
all
must
fry
that
the
merchant
risks
the
perils
of
the
plain
for
gain
nor
can
rulers
rule
a
house
that
men
grow
rich
in

ye

where
his

sown
with

there
is
rock
to

and

ye
may
hear

snick
where
never

taken

he
with

and
the
head
of

bid
him
stay

who

sits
not

at

he
up

away
from

bukloh
as
fast
as
he
can
fly
till
he
was
aware
of
his

mare
in

till
he
was
aware
of
his

mare
with
kamal
upon

back
and
when
he
could
spy
the
white
of
her
eye
he
made
the
pistol
crack
he
has
fired
once
he
has
fired
twice
but
the
whistling
ball
went
wide
ye
shoot
like

said
show
now
if
ye
can
it
up
and
over
the
tongue
of

as
blown
dustdevils
go
the

he
fled
like
a
stag
of
ten
but
the
mare
like
a
barren
doe
the
dun
he
leaned
against
the
bit
and
slugged
his
head
above
but
the
red
mare
played
with
the
as
a
maiden
plays
with
a
glove
there
was
rock
to
the
left
and
rock
to
the
right
and
low

thrice
he
heard
a

tho
never
a

was
seen
they
have
ridden
the
low
moon
out
of
the
sky
their
hoofs
drum
up
the
dawn
the
dun
he
went
like
a
wounded
bull
but
the
mare
like
a
fawn
the
dun
he
fell
at
a
in
a
woful
heap
fell
he
and
kamal
has
turned
the
red
mare
back
and
pulled
the
rider
free
he
has
knocked
the
pistol
out
of
his

small
room
was
there
to
strive
was
only
by
favour
of
mine
quoth
he
ye
rode
so
long
alive
there
was
not
a
rock
for
twenty
mile
there
was
not
a
clump
of
tree
but
covered
a
man
of
my
own
men
with
his
rifle
cocked
on
his
knee
if
i
had
raised
my
as
i
have
held
it
low
the
little
jackals
that
flee
so
fast
were
feasting
all
in
a
row
if
i
had
bowed
my
head
on
my
breast
as
i
have
held
it
high
the
kite
that
whistles
above
us
now
were
gorged
till
she
could
not
lightly
answered
the
colonel
son
do
good
to
bird
and
beast
but
count
who
come
for
the
broken
meats
before
thou
makest
a
feast
if
there
should
follow
a
thousand
swords
to
carry
my
bones
away
belike
the
price
of
a
jackal
meal
were
more
than
a
thief
could
pay
they
will
feed
their
horse
on
the
standing
crop
their
men
on
the
garnered
grain
the
thatch
of
the
byres
will
serve
their
fires
when
all
the
cattle
are
slain
but
if
thou
thinkest
the
price
be
fair
thy
brethren
wait
to
sup
the
hound
is
kin
to
the
howl
dog
and
call
them
up
and
if
thou
thinkest
the
price
be
high
in
steer
and
gear
and
stack
give
me
my
father
mare
again
and
i
fight
my
own
way
back
kamal
has
gripped
him
by
the
hand
and
set
him
upon
his
feet
no
talk
shall
be
of
dogs
said
he
when
wolf
and
gray
wolf
meet
may
i
eat
dirt
if
thou
hast
hurt
of
me
in
deed
or
breath
what
dam
of
lances
brought
thee
forth
to
jest
at
the
dawn
with
death
lightly
answered
the
colonel
son
i
hold
by
the
blood
of
my
clan
take
up
the
mare
for
my
father
gift
by
god
she
has
carried
a
man
the
red
mare
ran
to
the
colonel
son
and
nuzzled
against
his
breast
we
be
two
strong
men
said
kamal
then
but
she
loveth
the
younger
best
so
she
shall
go
with
a
lifter
dower
my
rein
my
broidered
saddle
and
and
silver
stirrups
the
colonel
son
a
pistol
drew
and
held
it
ye
have
taken
the
one
from
a
foe
said
he
will
ye
take
the
mate
from
a

a

the

not

years
ago
a

orders
of

against

would
have
broken
out
of
the
palace
had
not
the
gates
been
barred
but
one
of
them
disguised
as
the
king
favourite
passed
through
the
line
of
guards
and
reached
the
pyre
there
her
courage
failing
she
prayed
her
cousin
a
baron
of
the
court
to
kill
her
this
he
did
not
knowing
who
she
was
udai
chand
lay
sick
to
death
in
his
hold
by
gungra
hill
all
night
we
heard
the
ring
for
the
soul
of
the
dying
rajpoot
king
all
night
beat
up
from
the
women
wing
a
cry
that
we
could
not
still
all
night
the
barons
came
and
went
the
lords
of
the
outer
guard
all
night
the
cressets
glimmered
pale
on
ulwar
sabre
and
tonk
jezail
mewar
headstall
and
marwar
mail
that
clinked
in
the
palace
yard
in
the
golden
room
on
the
palace
roof
all
night
he
fought
for
air
and
there
was
sobbing
behind
the
screen
rustle
and
whisper
of
women
unseen
and
the
hungry
eyes
of
the
boondi
queen
on
the
death
she
might
not
share
he
passed
at
dawn
the
leaped
from
ridge
to
from
the
malwa
plains
to
the
abu
scars
and
wail
upon
wail
went
up
to
the
stars
behind
the
grim
when
they
knew
that
the
king
was
dead
the
dumb
priest
knelt
to
tie
his
mouth
and
robe
him
for
the
pyre
the
boondi
queen
beneath
us
cried
see
now
that
we
die
as
our
mothers
died
in
the
by
our
master
side
out
women
to
the
fire
we
drove
the
great
gates
home
apace
white
hands
were
on
the
sill
but
ere
the
rush
of
the
unseen
feet
had
reached
the
turn
to
the
open
street
the
bars
shot
down
the
beat
we
held
the
dovecot
still
a
face
looked
down
in
the
gathering
day
and
laughing
spoke
from
the
wall
ohe
they
mourn
here
let
me
by
azizun
the
lucknow
i
when
the
house
is
rotten
the
rats
must
fly
and
i
seek
another
thrall
for

ruled
the
king
as
did
queen
tonight
the
queens
rule
me
guard
them
safely
but
let
me
go
or
ever
they
pay
the
debt
they
owe
in
scourge
and
torture
she
leaped
below
and
the
grim
guard
watched
her
flee
they
knew
that
the
king
had
spent
his
soul
on
a
that
he
prayed
to
a
lucknow
god
and
kissed
the
ground
where
her
feet
had
trod
and
doomed
to
death
at
her
drunken
nod
and
swore
by
her
lightest
curl
we
bore
the
king
to
his
fathers
place
where
the
tombs
of
the

where
the
gray
apes
swing

all
night
the
red
flame
stabbed
the
sky
with
wavering
spears
and
out
of
a
shattered
temple
crept
a
woman
who
veiled
her
head
and
wept
and
called
on
the
king
but
the
great
king
slept
and
turned
not
for
her
tears
small
thought
had
he
to
mark
the
strife
cold
fear
with
hot
desire
when
thrice
she
leaped
from
the
leaping
flame
and
thrice
she
beat
her
breast
for
shame
and
thrice
like
a
wounded
dove
she
came
and
moaned
about

fire

watched

silent
streets
between
who

stood
by
the
king
in
sport
and

to
blade
in

or
boar
at
bay
and
he
was
a
baron
old
and
gray
and
kin
to
the
boondi
queen
he
said
o
shameless
put
aside
the
veil
upon
thy
brow
who
held
the
king
and
all
his
land
to
the
wanton
will
of
a
harlot
hand
will
the
white
ash
rise
from
the
blistered
brand
stoop
down
and
call
him
now
then
she
by
the
faith
of
my
tarnished
soul
all
things
i
did
not
well
i
had
hoped
to
clear
ere
the
fire
died
and
lay
me
down
by
my
master
side
to
rule
in
heaven
his
only
bride
while
the
others
howl
in
hell
but
i
have
felt
the
fire
breath
and
hard
it
is
to
die
yet
if
i
may
pray
a
rajpoot
lord
to
sully
the
steel
of
a
thakur
sword
with
blood
of
a
trade
abhorred
and
the
thakur
answered
he
drew
and
struck
the
straight
blade
drank
the
life
beneath
the
breast
i
had
looked
for
the
queen
to
face
the
flame
but
the
harlot
dies

lean
red
as

and
blue
as

fluttered
from

to

up
anew

they
found
their
meal
on
the
heart
of
the
boondi
queen
the
ballad
of
the

abdhur

the
durani
chief
of
him

the

his

his
grace
is
manifold
he
has
taken
toll
of
the
north
and
the
south
his
glory
reacheth
far
and
they
tell
the
tale
of
his
charity
from
balkh
to
kandahar
before
the
old
peshawur
gate
where
kurd
and
kaffir
meet
the
governor
of
kabul
dealt
the
justice
of
the
street
and
that
was
strait
as
running
noose
and
swift
as
plunging
knife
tho
he
who
held
the
longer
purse
might
hold
the
longer
life
there
was
a
hound
of
hindustan

struck
a
euzufzai
wherefore
they
spat
upon
his
face
and
led
him
out
to
die
it
chanced
the
king
went
forth
that
hour
when
throat
was
bared
to
knife
the
kaffir
grovelled
and
clamoured
for
his
life
then
said
the
king
have
hope
o

death
disgraced
is
hard
much
honour
shall
be
thine
and
called
the
captain
of

yar
khan
a
bastard
of
the
blood
so
saith
and
he
was
honoured
of
the
king
the
which
is
salt
to
death
and
he
was
son
of
daoud
shah
the
reiver
of
the
plains
and
blood
of
old
durani
lords
ran
fire
in
his
veins
and
was
to
tame
an
afghan
pride
nor
hell
nor
heaven
could
bind

make

flag
unrolled
when
the
big
guns

to
the
khyber
peak
and
his
fly
ye
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
wolves
of
the
abazai
that
night
before
the
watch
was
set
when
all
the
streets
were

spoke

that
clamour
for
thy
that
night
when
all
the
gates
were
shut
to

and
to
throne
within
a
little
the
king
lay
down
alone
before
the
sinking
of
the
moon
which
is
the
night
of
night
yar
khan
came
softly
to
the
king
to
make
his
honour
white
the
children
of
the
town
had
mocked
beneath
his
horse
hoofs
the
harlots
of
the
town
had
hailed
him
butcher
from
their
roofs
but
as
he
groped
against
the
wall
two
hands
upon
him
fell
the
king
behind
his
shoulder
spake
dead
man
thou
dost
not
well
is
ill
to
jest
with
kings
by
day
and
seek
a
boon
by
night
and
that
thou
bearest
in
thy
hand
is
all
too
sharp
to
write
but
three
days
hence
if
god
be
good
and
if
thy
strength
remain
thou
shalt
demand
one
boon
of
me
and
bless
me
in
thy
pain
for
i
am
merciful
to
all

of

the
ghilzai
knows
ere
the
melting
snows
when
the
swollen
banks
break
forth
when
the
crawl
to
the
sungar
wall
and
his
usbeg
lances
fail
ye
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
wolves
of
the
zuka
kheyl
they
stoned
him
in
the
when
dawn
was
in
the
sky
according
to
the
written
word
see
that
he
do
not
they
stoned
him
till
the
stones
were
piled
above
him
on
the
plain
and
those
the
labouring
limbs
displaced
they
tumbled
back
again
one
watched
beside
the
dreary
mound
that
veiled
the
battered
thing
and
him
the
king
with
laughter
called
the
herald
of
the
king
it
was
upon
the
second
night
the
night
of
ramazan
the
watcher
leaning
earthward
heard
the
message
of
yar
khan
from
shattered
breast
through
shrivelled
lips
broke
forth
the
rattling
breath
creature
of
god
deliver
me
from
agony
of
they
sought
the
king
among
his
girls
and
risked
their
lives
thereby
protector
of
the
pitiful
give
orders
that
he
die
bid
him
endure
until
the
day
a
lagging
answer
came
the
night
is
short
and
he
can
pray
and
learn
to
bless
my
before
the
dawn
three
times
he
spoke
and
on
the
day
once
more
creature
of
god
deliver
me
and
bless
the
king
therefor
they
shot
him
at
the
morning
prayer
to
ease
him
of
his
pain
and
when
he
heard
the
matchlocks
clink
he
blessed
the
king
again
which
thing
the
singers
made
a
song
for
all
the
world
to
sing
so
that
the
outer
seas
may
know
the
mercy
of
the
king
abdhur
rahman
the
durani
chief
of
him
is
the
story
told
he
has
opened
his
mouth
to
the
north
and
the
south
they
have
stuffed
his
mouth
with
gold
ye
know
the
truth
of
his
tender
ruth
and
sweet
his
favours
are
ye
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
from
balkh
to
kandahar
the
ballad
of
the
king
jest
when
flushes
the
desert
grass
our
kafilas
wind
through
the
khyber
pass
lean
are
the
camels
but
fat
the
frails
light
are
the
purses
but
heavy
the
bales
as
the
snowbound
trade
of
the
north
comes
down
to
the
of
peshawur
town
in
a
turquoise
twilight
crisp
and
chill
a
kafila
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
then
blue
of
the
cooking
rose
and
answered
to
and
the
picketed
ponies
shag
and
wild
strained
at
their
ropes
as
the
feed
was
piled
and
the
bubbling
camels
beside
the
load
sprawled
for
a
furlong
adown
the
road
and
the
persian
brought
for
sale
spat
at
the
dogs
from
the
and
the
tribesmen
bellowed
to
hasten
the
food
and
the
twinkled
by
fort
jumrood
and
there
fled
on
the
wings
of
the
gathering
dusk
a
savour
of
camels
and
carpets
and
musk
a
murmur
of
voices
a
reek
of
smoke
to
tell
us
the
trade
of
the
khyber
woke
the
lid
of
the
chattered
high
the
knives
were
whetted
and
then
came
i
to
mahbub
ali
the
muleteer
patching
his
bridles
and
counting
his
gear
crammed
with
the
gossip
of
half
a
year
but
mahbub
ali
the
kindly
said
better
is
speech
when
the
belly
is
so
we
plunged
the
hand
to
the
deep
in
a
cinnamon
stew
of
the
sheep
and
he
who
never
hath
tasted
the
food
by
allah
he
knoweth
not
bad
from
good
we
cleansed
our
beards
of
the
we
lay
on
the
mats
and
were
filled
with
peace
and
the
talk
slid
north
and
the
talk
slid
south
with
the
sliding
puffs
from
the
four
things
greater
than
all
things
are
women
and
horses
and
power
and
war
we
spake
of
them
all
but
the
last
the
most
for
i
sought
a
word
of
a
russian
post
of
a
shifty
promise
an
unsheathed
sword
and
a
guard
on
the
helmund
ford
then
mahbub
ali
lowered
his
eyes
in
the
fashion
of
one
who
is
weaving
lies
quoth
he
of
the
russians
who
can
say
when
the
night
is
gathering
all
is
gray
but
we
look
that
the
gloom
of
the
night
shall
die
in
the
morning
flush
of
a
sky
friend
of
my
heart
is
it

or
wise
to
warn
a
king
of
his
enemies
we
know
what
heaven
or
hell
may
bring
but
no
man
knoweth
the
mind
of
the

that
unsought

the

his

was
a
clucking
khuttuck

and
the

close
to

he
carried
the
curse
of
an
unstanched

so
that
he
sought
the
favour
of

at
the
kabul
court
and
travelled
in

to
kabul
in
full
durbar
the
king
held
talk
with
his
chief
in
war
into
the
press
of
the
crowd
he
broke
and
what
he
had
heard
of
the
coming
spoke
then
gholam
hyder
the
red
chief
smiled
as
a
mother
might
on
a
babbling
child
but
those
who
would
laugh
restrained
their
breath
when
the
face
of
the
king
showed
dark
as
death
evil
it
is
in
full
durbar
to
cry
to
a
ruler
of
gathering
war
slowly
he
led
to
a
small
that
grew
by
a
cleft
of
the
city
wall
and
he
said
to
the
boy
shall
praise
thy
zeal
so
long
as
the
red
spurt
follows
the
steel
the
russ
is
upon
us

a

set
that
he
might
not
flee
a
score
of
bayonets
ringed
the
tree
the
fell
in
showers
of
snow
when
he
shook
at
his
death
as
he
looked
below
by
the
power
of
god
who
alone
is
great
till
the
seventh
day
he
fought
with
his
fate
then
madness
took
him
and
men
declare
he
mowed
in
the
branches
as
ape
and
bear
and
last
as
a
sloth
ere
his

failed
and
he
hung
as
a

in
the
forks
and
wailed
and
sleep
the
cord
of
his
hands
untied
and
he
fell
and

on

night
is
gathering
all
is
gray
to
things
greater
than
all

and
the

and
since
we
know
not
how
war
may
prove
heart
of
my

let
us
talk
of
love
the
ballad
of
boh
da
thone
this
is
the
ballad
of
boh
da
thone
erst
a
pretender
to
theebaw
throne
who
harried
the
district
of
alalone
how
he
met
with
his
fate
and
the
at
the
hand
of
harendra
mukerji
senior
gomashta
boh
da
thone
was
a
warrior
bold
his
sword
and
his
snider
were
bossed
with
gold
and
the
peacock
banner
his
henchmen
bore
was
stiff
with
bullion
but
stiffer
with
gore
he
shot
at
the
strong
and
he
slashed
at
the
weak
from
the
salween
scrub
to
the
chindwin
teak
he
crucified
noble
he
sacrificed
mean
he
filled
old
ladies
with
kerosene
while
over
the
water
the
papers
cried
the
patriot
fights
for
his
countryside
but
little
they
cared
for
the
native
press
the
worn
white
soldiers
in
khaki
dress
who
tramped
through
the
jungle
and
camped
in
the
byre
who
died
in
the
swamp
and
were
tombed
in
the
mire
who
gave
up
their
lives
at
the
queen
command
for
the
pride
of
their
race
and
the
peace
of
the
land
now
first
of
the
foemen
of
boh
da
thone
was
captain
of
the
black
tyrone
and
his
was
a
company
seventy
strong
who
hustled
that
dissolute
chief
along
there
were
lads
from
galway
and
louth
and
meath
who
went
to
their
death
with
a
joke
in
their
teeth
and
worshipped
with
fluency
fervour
and
zeal
the
mud
on
the
of
crook
but
ever
a
blight
on
their
labours
lay
and
ever
their
quarry
would
vanish
away
till
the
boys
of
the
black
tyrone
took
a
brotherly
interest
in
boh
da
thone
and
sooth
if
pursuit
in
possession
ends
the
boh
and
his
trackers
were
best
of
friends
the
word
of
a
scout
a
march
by
night
a
rush
through
the
mist
a
scattering
fight
a
volley
from
cover
a
corpse
in
the
clearing
the
glimpse
of
a
and
heavy
jade
earring
the
flare
of
a
village
the
tally
of
slain
and
the
boh
was
abroad
on
the
raid
again
they
cursed
their
luck
as
the
irish
will
they
gave
him
credit
for
cunning
and
skill
they
buried
their
dead
they
bolted
their
beef
and
started
anew
on
the
track
of
the
thief
till
in
place
of
the
kalends
of
greece
men
said
when
crook
and
his
darlings
come
back
with
the
they
had
hunted
the
boh
from
the
hills
to
the
plain
he
doubled
and
broke
for
the
hills
again
they
had
crippled
his
power
for
rapine
and
raid
they
had
routed
him
out
of
his
pet
stockade
and
at
last
they
came
when
the
day
star
tired
to
a
camp
deserted
a
village
fired
a
black
cross
blistered
the
and
the
body
upon
it
was
stark
and
cold
the
wind
of
the
dawn
went
merrily
past
the
high
grass
bowed
her
plumes
to
the
blast
and
out
of
the
grass
on
a
sudden
broke
a
spirtle
of
fire
a
whorl
of
smoke
and
captain
of
the
black
tyrone
was
blessed
with
a
slug
in
the
the
gift
of
his
enemy
boh
da
thone
now
a
slug
that
is
hammered
from
is
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
and
a
rankling
fire
the
festered
as
may
in
a
steaming
barrack
at
mandalay
the
left
arm
throbbed
and
the
captain
swore
i
like
to
be
after
the
boh
once
more
the
fever
held
him
the
captain
said
i
give
a
hundred
to
look
at
his
head
the
hospital
punkahs
creaked
and
whirred
but
babu
harendra
gomashta
heard
he
thought
of
the
green
and
dank
that
girdled
his
home
by
the
dacca
tank
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
his
high
school
son
he
thought
but
abandoned
the
thought
of
a
gun
his
sleep
was
broken
by
visions
dread
of
a
shining
boh
with
a
silver
head
he
kept
his
counsel
and
went
his
way
and
swindled
the
cartmen
of
half
their
pay
and
the
months
went
on
as
the
worst
must
do
and
the
boh
returned
to
the
raid
anew
but
the
captain
had
quitted
the
strife
and
in
far
simoorie
had
taken
a
wife
and
she
was
a
damsel
of
delicate
mould
with
hair
like
the
sunshine
and
heart
of
gold
and
little
she
knew
the
arms
that
embraced
had
cloven
a
man
from
the
brow
to
the
waist
and
little
she
knew
that
the
loving
lips
had
ordered
a
quivering
life
eclipse
and
the
eye
that
lit
at
her
lightest
breath
had
glared
unawed
in
the
gates
of
death
for
these
be
matters
a
man
would
hide
as
a
general
rule
from
an
innocent
bride
and
little
the
captain
thought
of
the
past
and
of
all
men
babu
harendra
last
but
slow
in
the
sludge
of
the
kathun
road
the
government
bullock
train
toted
its
load
speckless
and
spotless
and
shining
with
ghee
in
the
rearmost
cart
sat
the
and
ever
a
phantom
before
him
fled
of
a
scowling
boh
with
a
silver
head
then
the
stuck
though
the
coolies
slaved
and
the
cartmen
flogged
and
the
escort
raved
and
out
of
the
jungle
with
yells
and
squeals
pranced
boh
da
thone
and
his
gang
at
his
heels
then
belching
blunderbuss
answered
back
the
snider
snarl
and
the
carbine
crack
and
the
blithe
revolver
began
to
sing
to
the
blade
that
twanged
on
the
and
the
brown
flesh
blued
where
the
kissed
as
the
steel
shot
back
with
a
wrench
and
a
twist
and
the
great
white
bullocks
with
onyx
eyes
watched
the
souls
of
the
dead
arise
and
over
the
smoke
of
the
fusillade
the
peacock
banner
staggered
and
swayed
oh
gayest
of
scrimmages
man
may
see
is
a
rush
on
the
the
babu
shook
at
the
horrible
sight
and
girded
his
ponderous
loins
for
flight
but
fate
had
ordained
that
the
boh
should
start
on
a
raid
of
the
rearmost
cart
and
out
of
that
cart
with
a
bellow
of
woe
the
babu
fell
flat
on
the
top
of
the
boh
for
years
had
harendra
served
the
state
to
the
growth
of
his
purse
and
the
girth
of
his
there
were
twenty
stone
as
the
knows
on
the
broad
of
the
chest
of
this
best
of
bohs
and
twenty
stone
from
a
height
discharged
are
bad
for
a
boh
with
a
spleen
enlarged
oh
short
was
the
struggle
severe
was
the
shock
he
dropped
like
a
bullock
he
lay
like
a
block
and
the
babu
above
him
convulsed
with
fear
heard
the
labouring
hissed
out
in
his
ear
and
thus
in
a
fashion
undignified
the
princely
pest
of
the
chindwin
died
turn
now
to
simoorie
where
lapped
in
his
ease
the
captain
is
petting
the
bride
on
his
knees
where
the
whit
of
the
bullet
the
wounded
man
scream
are
mixed
as
the
mist
of
some
devilish
dream
forgotten
forgotten
the
sweat
of
the
shambles
where
the
blooms
and
the
gray
monkey
gambols
from
the
set
free
and
released
from
the
steel
the
peace
of
the
lord
is
with
captain
up
the
hill
to
simoorie
most
patient
of
drudges
the
bags
on
his
shoulder
the
trudges
for
captain
sahib
one
hundred
and
ten
rupees
to
collect
on
then
their
breakfast
was
stopped
while
the
and
hammer
tore
waxcloth
split
and
chipped
out
the
dammer
on
the
napery
snow
with
a
crash
and
a
thud
rolled
the
head
of
the
boh
and
gummed
to
the
scalp
was
a
letter
which
ran
in
fielding

love
and
affection
for

and
show
awful
kindness
to
satisfy
me
i
am
graceful
master
your
as
the
rabbit
is
drawn
to
the
rattlesnake
power
as
the
smoker
eye
fills
at
the
opium
hour
as
a
horse
reaches
up
to
the
manger
above
as
the
waiting
ear
yearns
for
the
whisper
of
love
from
the
arms
of
the
bride
and
slow
the
captain
bent
down
to
the
head
of
the
boh
and
as
he
looked
on
the
thing
where
it
lay
the
winking
new
spoons
and
the
napkins
array
the
freed
mind
fled
back
to
the
days
the
scuffle
the
smoke
and
the
blaze
the
forced
march
at
night
and
the
quick
rush
at
dawn
the
banjo
at
twilight
the
burial
ere
morn
the
stench
of
the
marshes
the
raw
piercing
smell
when
the
overhand
silenced
the
yell
the
oaths
of
his
irish
that
surged
when
they
stood
where
the
black
crosses
hung
the
kuttamow
flood
as
a
derelict
ship
drifts
away
with
the
tide
the
captain
went
out
on
the
past
from
his
bride
back
back
through
the
springs
to
the
chill
of
the
year
when
he
hunted
the
boh
from
maloon
to
tsaleer
as
the
shape
of
a
corpse
dimmers
up
through
deep
water
in
his
eye
lit
the
passionless
passion
of
slaughter
and
men
who
had
fought
with
for
the
life
had
gazed
on
his
face
with
less
dread
than
his
wife
for
she
who
had
held
him
so
long
could
not
hold
him
though
a
eternity
should
have
controlled
him
but
watched
the
twin
terror
the
head
turned
to
head
the
scowling
scarred
black
and
the
flushed
savage
red
the
spirit
that
changed
from
her
knowing
and
flew
to
some
grim
hidden
past
she
had
never
a
clue
to
but
it
knew
as
it
grinned
for
he
touched
it
unfearing
and
muttered
aloud
so
you
kept
that
jade
earring
then
nodded
and
kindly
as
friend
nods
to
friend
old
man
you
fought
well
but
you
lost
in
the
the
visions
departed
and
shame
followed
passion
he
took
what
i
said
in
this
horrible
fashion
i
write
to
harendra
with

unsainted
the
captain
came
back
to
the

who
had
fainted

this
is

no

the
rhyme
of
the
three
captains
this
ballad
appears
to
refer
to
one
of
the
exploits
of
the
notorious
paul
jones
the
american
pirate
it
is
founded
on
fact
at
the
close
of
a
winter
day
their
anchors
down
by
london
town
the
three
great
captains
lay
and
one
was
admiral
of
the
north
from
solway
firth
to
skye
and
one
was
lord
of
the
wessex
coast
and
all
the
lands
thereby
and
one
was
master
of
the
thames
from
limehouse
to
blackwall
and
he
was
captain
of
the
fleet
the
bravest
of
them
all
their
good
guns
guarded
their
great
gray
sides
that
were
thirty
foot
in
the
sheer
when
there
came
a
certain
with
news
of
a
privateer
her
rigging
was
rough
with
the
clotted
drift
that
drives
in
a
northern
breeze
her
sides
were
clogged
with
the
lazy
weed
that
spawns
in
the
eastern
seas
light
she
rode
in
the
rude
to
left
and
right
she
rolled
and
the
skipper
sat
on
the
and
stared
at
an
empty
hold
i
ha
paid
port
dues
for
your
law
quoth
he
and
where
is
the
law
ye
boast
if
i
sail
unscathed
from
a
heathen
port
to
be
robbed
on
a
christian
coast
ye
have
smoked
the
hives
of
the
laccadives
as
we
burn
the
lice
in
a
bunk
we
tack
not
now
to
a
gallang
prow
or
a
plunging
junk
i
had
no
fear
but
the
seas
were
clear
as
far
as
a
sail
might
fare
till
i
met
with
a
yankee
brig
that
rode
off
finisterre
there
were
canvas
blinds
to
his
ports
to
screen
the
weight
he
bore
and
the
signals
ran
for
a
merchantman
from
sandy
hook
to
the
nore
he
would
not
fly
the
rovers
flag
the
bloody
or
the
black
but
now
he
floated
the
gridiron
and
now
he
flaunted
the
jack
he
spoke
of
the
law
as
he
crimped
my
crew
he
swore
it
was
only
a
loan
but
when
i
would
ask
for
my
own
again
he
swore
it
was
none
of
my
own
he
has
taken
my
little
parrakeets
that
nest
beneath
the
line
he
has
stripped
my
rails
of
the
and
the
green
unripened
pine
he
has
taken
my
bale
of
dammer
and
spice
i
won
beyond
the
seas
he
has
taken
my
grinning
heathen
gods
and
what
should
he
want
o
these
my
foremast
would
not
mend
his
boom
my
deckhouse
patch
his
boats
he
has
whittled
the
two
this
yank
yahoo
to
peddle
for
oats
i
could
not
fight
for
the
failing
light
and
a
rough
beside
but
i
hulled
him
once
for
a
clumsy
crimp
and
twice
because
he
lied
had
i
had
guns
as
i
had
goods
to
work
my
christian
harm
i
had
run
him
up
from
his
to
trade
with
his
own
i
had
nailed
his
ears
to
my
and
ripped
them
off
with
a
saw
and
soused
them
in
the
bilgewater
and
served
them
to
him
raw
i
had
flung
him
blind
in
a
rudderless
boat
to
rot
in
the
rocking
dark
i
had
towed
him
aft
of
his
own
craft
a
bait
for
his
brother
shark
i
had
lapped
him
round
with
cocoa
husk
and
drenched
him
with
the
oil
and
lashed
him
fast
to
his
own
mast
to
blaze
above
my
spoil
i
had
stripped
his
hide
for
my
and
tasselled
his
beard
i
the
mesh
and
spitted
his
crew
on
the
live
bamboo
that
grows
through
the
gangrened
flesh
i
had
hove
him
down
by
the
mangroves
brown
where
the
sucks
and
draws
moored
by
the
heel
to
his
own
keel
to
wait
for
the
claws
he
is
lazar
within
and
lime
without
ye
can
nose
him
far
enow
for
he
carries
the
taint
of
a
musky
ship
the
reek
of
the
slaver
dhow
the
skipper
looked
at
the
tiering
guns
and
the
bulwarks
tall
and
cold
and
the
captains
three
full
courteously
peered
down
at
the
gutted
hold
and
the
captains
three
called
courteously
from
deck
to
good
sir
we
ha
dealt
with
that
merchantman
or
ever
your
teeth
were
cut
your
words
be
words
of
a
lawless
race
and
the
law
it
standeth
thus
he
comes
of
a
race
that
have
never
a
law
and
he
never
has
boarded
us
we
ha
sold
him
canvas
and
rope
and
spar
we
know
that
his
price
is
fair
and
we
know
that
he
weeps
for
the
lack
of
a
law
as
he
rides
off
finisterre
and
since
he
is
damned
for
a
by
you
and
better
than
you
we
hold
it
meet
that
the
english
fleet
should
know
that
we
hold
him
the
skipper
called
to
the
tall
taffrail
and
what
is
that
to
me
did
ever
you
hear
of
a
yankee
brig
that
rifled
a
do
i
loom
so
large
from
your
that
i
lift
like
a
ship
the
line
he
has
learned
to
run
from
a
shotted
gun
and
harry
such
craft
as
mine
there
is
never
a
law
on
the
cocos
keys
to
hold
a
white
man
in
but
we
do
not
steal
the
niggers
meal
for
that
is
a
nigger
sin
must
he
have
his
law
as
a
quid
to
chaw
or
laid
in
brass
on
his
wheel
does
he
steal
with
tears
when
he
buccaneers
gad
then
why
does
he
steal
the
skipper
bit
on
a
word
and
the
word
it
was
not
sweet
for
he
could
see
the
captains
three
had
signalled
to
the
fleet
but
three
and
two
in
white
and
blue
the
whimpering
flags
began
we
have
heard
a
tale
of
a
foreign
sail
but

beneath
his

swore
by

of

my
picaroon

we
have
sold
our

to
the

we
know
that
his

winked
his

and
swore
by

the
halliards
twanged
against

the
ballad
of

our

would
sweep
the

clean
wherefore
she
kept
her
hatches
close
when
the

arose
to
save
the

had
one
of

deep
in

they
racked
their

and

free
in

of

tide
it
was
our
clampherdown
fell
in
with
a
cruiser
light
that
carried
the
dainty
hotchkiss
gun
and
a
pair
o
heels
wherewith
to
run
from
the
grip
of
a
fight
she
opened
fire
at
seven
miles
as
ye
shoot
at
a
bobbing
cork
and
once
she
fired
and
twice
she
fired
till
the
drooped
like

that

the
melts
apace
the

for
an

or
twain
and
patch
the
shattered
plates
and
he
answered
make
it
she
opened
fire
within
the
mile
as
ye
shoot
at
the
flying
duck
and
the
great
shot
fair

with
the

of

below
you
can

the
hiss
of
the
helpless
ram
you
can
hear
the
twisted
runners
and
he
answered
turn
and
go
it
was
our
clampherdown
and
grimly
did
she
roll
swung
round
to
take
the
cruiser
fire
as
the

faces
the

ire
when

the

it

the

they
can
not

down
lie
down

beam
we
dare
not

for
she
can

and
dare
ye
fire
another

and

in
the

steam
it
was
our
clampherdown
that
carried
an
but
fifty
feet
at

lay
bare
as
the

of
the

the

of

they
hack
us
through

through

chilled
steel
bolts
are
swift
we
have
emptied
the
bunkers
in
open
sea
their
shrapnel
bursts
where
our
coal
should

he
answered
let
her
it
was
our
clampherdown
swung
round
upon
the
tide
her
two
dumb
guns
glared
south
and
north
and
the
blood
and
the
bubbling
steam
ran
forth

she
ground

they

they

answered
grapple

they
have
asked
for
the
steel
they
shall
have
it
now
out
cutlasses
and
board
it
was
our
clampherdown
spewed
up
four
hundred
men
and
the
scalded
stokers
yelped
delight
as
they
rolled
in
the
waist
and
heard
the
fight
stamp
their
pen
they
cleared
the
cruiser
end
to
end
from
to
hold
they
fought
as
they
fought
in
nelson
fleet
they
were
stripped
to
the
waist
they
were
bare
to
the
feet
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
old
it
was
the
sinking
clampherdown
heaved
up
her
battered
side
and
carried
a
million
pounds
in
steel
to
the
cod
and
the
and
the
scour
of
the
channel
tide
it
was
the
crew
of
the
clampherdown
stood
out
to
sweep
the
sea
on
a
cruiser
won
from
an
ancient
foe
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
long
ago
and
as
it
still
shall
be
the
ballad
of
the
bolivar
seven
men
from
all
the
world
back
to
docks
again
rolling
down
the
ratcliffe
road
drunk
and
raising
cain
give
the
girls
another
drink
we
sign
away
we
that
took
the
bolivar
out
across
the
bay
we
put
out
from
sunderland
loaded
down
with
rails
we
put
back
to
sunderland
our
cargo
shifted
we
put
out
from
sunderland
met
the
winter
gales
seven
days
and
seven
nights
to
the
start
we
drifted
racketing
her
rivets
loose
white
as
snow
all
the
coals
adrift
adeck
half
the
rails
below
leaking
like
a
steering
like
a
dray
out
we
took
the
bolivar
out
across
the
bay
one
by
one
the
lights
came
up
winked
and
let
us
by
mile
by
mile
we
waddled
on
coal
and
short
met
a
blow
that
laid
us
down
heard
a
bulkhead
fly
left
the
wolf
behind
us
with
a
list
to
port
trailing
like
a
wounded
duck
working
out
her
soul
clanging
like
a
after
every
roll
just
a
funnel
and
a
mast
lurching
through
the
spray
so
we
threshed
the
bolivar
out
across
the
bay
her
hog
and
felt
her
sag
betted
when
she
break
wondered
every
time
she
raced
if
she
stand
the
shock
heard
the
seas
like
drunken
men
pounding
at
her
strake
hoped
the
lord
keep
his
thumb
on
the
banged
against
the
iron
decks
bilges
choked
with
coal
flayed
and
frozen
foot
and
hand
sick
of
heart
and
soul
last
we
prayed
she
buck
herself
into
judgment
day
hi
we
cursed
the
bolivar
knocking
round
the
bay
o
her
nose
flung
up
to
sky
groaning
to
be
still
up
and
down
and
back
we
went
never
time
for
breath
then
the
money
paid
at
lloyd
caught
her
by
the
heel
and
the
stars
ran
round
and
round
dancin
at
our
death
aching
for
an
hour
sleep
dozing
off
between
the
rotten
rivets
draw
when
she
took
it
green
the
compass
chase
its
tail
like
a
cat
at
play
that
was
on
the
bolivar
south
across
the
bay
once
we
saw
between
the
squalls
lyin
head
to
swell
mad
with
work
and
weariness
wishin
they
was
we
some
damned
liner
lights
go
by
like
a
long
hotel
cheered
her
from
the
bolivar
swampin
in
the
sea
then
a
grayback
cleared
us
out
then
the
skipper
laughed
boys
the
wheel
has
gone
to
hell
rig
the
winches
aft
yoke
the
kicking
get
her
under
way
so
we
steered
her
out
across
the
bay
just
a
pack
o
rotten
plates
puttied
up
with
tar
in
we
came
an
time

ai

we

across

the

above
the
portico
a
bearing
the

remained
fluttering
in
the
flames
for
some
time
but
ultimately
when
it
fell
the
crowds
rent
the

with
shouts
and
seemed
to
see

my

where
the

on

croon
their
endless
ocean
legends
to
the
lazy
locked
lagoon
strayed
amid
lonely

mazed
amid

waked
the

to

i
tossed
the

in

never
was
isle
so
little
never
was
sea
so
lone
but
over
the
scud
and
the
an

was
flown
i
have
wrenched
it
free
from
the
halliard
to
hang
for
a
wisp
on
the
horn
i
have
chased
it
north
to
the

ribboned

rolled

torn
i
have
spread
its
fold
the
dying
adrift
in
a
hopeless
sea
i

hurled
it
swift
on

seen
the

that
the

was

day
of

from

the

of

that
the

of

made

tomlinson
now
tomlinson
gave
up
the
ghost
in
his
house
in
berkeley
square
and
a
spirit
came
to
his
bedside
and
gripped
him
by
the
hair
a
spirit
gripped
him
by
the
hair
and
carried
him
far
away
till
he
heard
as
the
roar
of
a
ford
the
roar
of
the
milky
way
till
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
milky
way
die
down
and
drone
and
cease
and
they
came
to
the
gate
within
the
wall
where
peter
holds
the
keys
stand
up
stand
up
now
tomlinson
and
answer
loud
and
high
the
good
that
ye
did
for
the
sake
of
men
or
ever
ye
came
to
die
the
good
that
ye
did
for
the
sake
of
men
in
little
earth
so
lone
and
the
naked
soul
of
tomlinson
grew
white
as
a
bone
o
i
have
a
friend
on
earth
he
said
that
was
my
priest
and
guide
and
well
would
he
answer
all
for
me
if
he
were
by
my
for
that
ye
strove
in
it
shall
be
written
fair
but
now
ye
wait
at
heaven
gate
and
not
in
berkeley
square
though
we
called
your
friend
from
his
bed
this
night
he
could
not
speak
for
you
for
the
race
is
run
by
one
and
one
and
never
by
two
and
then
tomlinson
looked
up
and
down
and
little
gain
was
there
for
the
naked
stars
grinned
overhead
and
he
saw
that
his
soul
was
bare
the
wind
that
blows
between
the
worlds
it
cut
him
like
a
knife
and
tomlinson
took
up
his
tale
and
spoke
of
his
good
in
life
this
i
have
read
in
a
book
he
said
and
that
was
told
to
me
and
this
i
have
thought
that
another
man
thought
of
a
prince
in
the
good
souls
flocked
like
homing
doves
and
bade
him
clear
the
path
and
peter
twirled
the
jangling
keys
in
weariness
and
wrath
ye
have
read
ye
have
heard
ye
have
thought
he
said
and
the
tale
is
yet
to
run
by
the
worth
of
the
body
that
once
ye
had
give
answer
what
done
then
tomlinson
looked
back
and
forth
and
little
good
it
bore
for
the
darkness
stayed
at
his
and
heaven
gate
before
o
this
i
have
felt
and
this
i
have
guessed
and
this
i
have
heard
men
say
and
this
they
wrote
that
another
man
wrote
of
a
carl
in
ye
have
read
ye
have
felt
ye
have
guessed
good
lack
ye
have
hampered
heaven
gate
there
little
room
between
the
stars
in
idleness
to
prate
o
none
may
reach
by
hired
speech
of
neighbour
priest
and
kin
through
borrowed
deed
to
god
good
meed
that
lies
so
fair
within
get
hence
get
hence
to
the
lord
of
wrong
for
doom
has
yet
to
run
and
the
faith
that
ye
share
with
berkeley
square
uphold
you
tomlinson
the
spirit
gripped
him
by
the
hair
and
sun
by
sun
they
fell
till
they
came
to
the
belt
of
naughty
stars
that
rim
the
mouth
of
hell
the
first
are
red
with
pride
and
wrath
the
next
are
white
with
pain
but
the
third
are
black
with
clinkered
sin
that
can
not
burn
again
they
may
hold
their
path
they
may
leave
their
path
with
never
a
soul
to
mark
they
may
burn
or
freeze
but
they
must
not
cease
in
the
scorn
of
the
outer
dark
the
wind
that
blows
between
the
worlds
it
nipped
him
to
the
bone
and
he
yearned
to
the
flare
of
there
as
the
light
of
his
own
the
devil
he
sat
behind
the
bars
where
the
desperate
legions
drew
but
he
caught
the
hasting
tomlinson
and
would
not
let
him
through
wot
ye
the
price
of
good
that
i
must
pay
said
he
that
ye
rank
yoursel
so
fit
for
hell
and
ask
no
leave
of
me
i
am
all
to
adam
breed
that
ye
should
give
me
scorn
for
i
strove
with
god
for
your
first
father
the
day
that
he
was
born
sit
down
sit
down
upon
the
slag
and
answer
loud
and
high
the
harm
that
ye
did
to
the
sons
of
men
or
ever
you
came
to
and
tomlinson
looked
up
and
up
and
saw
against
the
night
the
belly
of
a
tortured
star
in
light
and
tomlinson
looked
down
and
down
and
saw
beneath
his
feet
the
frontlet
of
a
tortured
star
in
heat
o
i
had
a
love
on
earth
said
he
that
kissed
me
to
my
fall
and
if
ye
would
call
my
love
to
me
i
know
she
would
answer
all
that
ye
did
in
love
forbid
it
shall
be
written
fair
but
now
ye
wait
at
gate
and
not
in
berkeley
square
though
we
whistled
your
love
from
her
bed
tonight
i
trow
she
would
not
run
for
the
sin
ye
do
by
two
and
two
ye
must
pay
for
one
by
one
the
wind
that
blows
between
the
worlds
it
cut
him
like
a
knife
and
tomlinson
took
up
the
tale
and
spoke
of
his
sin
in
life
once
i
ha
laughed
at
the
power
of
love
and
twice
at
the
grip
of
the
grave
and
thrice
i
ha
patted
my
god
on
the
head
that
men
might
call
me
the
devil
he
blew
on
a
brandered
soul
and
set
it
aside
to
cool
do
ye
think
i
would
waste
my
good
on
the
hide
of
a
fool
i
see
no
worth
in
the
hobnailed
mirth
or
the
jolthead
jest
ye
did
that
i
should
waken
my
gentlemen
that
are
sleeping
three
on
a
then
tomlinson
looked
back
and
forth
and
there
was
little
grace
for
filled
the
houseless
soul
with
the
fear
of
naked
space
nay
this
i
ha
heard
quo
tomlinson
and
this
was
noised
abroad
and
this
i
ha
got
from
a
belgian
book
on
the
word
of
a
dead
french
ye
ha
heard
ye
ha
read
ye
ha
got
good
lack
and
the
tale
begins
afresh
have
ye
sinned
one
sin
for
the
pride
o
the
eye
or
the
sinful
lust
of
the
flesh
then
tomlinson
he
gripped
the
bars
and
yammered
let
me
in
for
i
mind
that
i
borrowed
my
neighbour
wife
to
sin
the
deadly
the
devil
he
grinned
behind
the
bars
and
banked
the
fires
high
did
ye
read
of
that
sin
in
a
book
said
he
and
tomlinson
said
ay
the
devil
he
blew
upon
his
nails
and
the
little
devils
ran
and
he
said
go
husk
this
whimpering
thief
that
comes
in
the
guise
of
a
man
winnow
him
out
star
and
star
and
sieve
his
proper
worth
there
sore
decline
in
adam
line
if
this
be
spawn
of
empusa
crew
so
they
may
not
face
the
fire
but
weep
that
they
bin
too
small
to
sin
to
the
height
of
their
desire
over
the
coal
they
chased
the
soul
and
racked
it
all
abroad
as
children
rifle
a
or
the
raven
foolish
hoard
and
back
they
came
with
the
tattered
thing
as
children
after
play
and
they
said
the
soul
that
he
got
from
god
he
has
bartered
clean
away
we
have
threshed
a
stook
of
print
and
book
and
winnowed
a
chattering
wind
and
many
a
soul
wherefrom
he
stole
but
his
we
can
not
find
we
have
handled
him
we
have
dandled
him
we
have
seared
him
to
the
bone
and
sure
if
tooth
and
nail
show
truth
he
has
no
soul
of
his
the
devil
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
breast
and
rumbled
deep
and
low
i
all
to
adam
breed
that
i
should
bid
him
go
yet
close
we
lie
and
deep
we
lie
and
if
i
gave
him
place
my
gentlemen
that
are
so
proud
would
flout
me
to
my
face
they
call
my
house
a
common
stews
and
me
a
careless
host
and
i
would
not
anger
my
gentlemen
for
the
sake
of
a
shiftless
the
devil
he
looked
at
the
mangled
soul
that
prayed
to
feel
the
flame
and
he
thought
of
holy
charity
but
he
thought
of
his
own
good
name
now
ye
could
haste
my
coal
to
waste
and
sit
ye
down
to
fry
did
ye
think
of
that
theft
for
yourself
said
he
and
tomlinson
said
ay
the
devil
he
blew
an
outward
breath
for
his
heart
was
free
from
care
ye
have
scarce
the
soul
of
a
louse
he
said
but
the
roots
of
sin
are
there
and
for
that
sin
should
ye
come
in
were
i
the
lord
alone
but
sinful
pride
has
rule
inside
and
mightier
than
my
own
honour
and
wit
they
sit
to
each
his
priest
and
whore
nay
scarce
i
dare
myself
go
there
and
you
they
torture
sore
ye
are
neither
spirit
nor
spirk
he
said
ye
are
neither
book
nor
brute
go
get
ye
back
to
the
flesh
again
for
the
sake
of
man
repute
i
all
to
adam
breed
that
i
should
mock
your
pain
but
look
that
ye
win
to
worthier
sin
ere
ye
come
back
again
get
hence
the
hearse
is
at
your
door
the
grim
black
stallions
wait
they
bear
your
clay
to
place
today
speed
lest
ye
come
too
late
go
back
to
earth
with
a
lip
unsealed
go
back
with
an
open
eye
and
carry
my
word
to
the
sons
of
men
or
ever
ye
come
to
die
that
the
sin
they
do
by
two
and
two
they
must
pay
for
one
by
one
and
the
god
that
you
took
from
a
printed
book
be
with
you
tomlinson
ballads
dedication
to

have
made
for
you
a
