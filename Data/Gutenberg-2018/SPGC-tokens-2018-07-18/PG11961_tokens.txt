i
the
blue
bird
the
tall
youth
turning
to
the
right
went
down
a
gentle
slope
until
he
came
to
a
little
stream
where
he
knelt
and
drank
despite
his
weariness
his
thirst
and
his
danger
he
noticed
the
silvery
color
of
the
water
and
its
soft
sighing
sound
as
it
flowed
over
its
pebbly
bed
made
a
pleasant
murmur
in
his
ear
robert
lennox
always
had
an
eye
for
the
beautiful
and
the
flashing
brook
in
its
setting
of
deep
intense
forest
green
soothed
his
senses
speaking
to
him
of
comfort
and
hope
he
drank
again
and
then
sat
back
among
the
bushes
still
breathing
heavily
but
with
much
more
freedom
the
sharp
pain
left
his
chest
new
strength
began
to
flow
into
his
muscles
and
as
the
body
was
renewed
so
the
spirit
soared
up
and
became
sanguine
once
more
he
put
his
ear
to
the
earth
and
listened
long
but
heard
nothing
save
sounds
natural
to
the
wilderness
the
rustling
of
leaves
before
the
light
wind
the
whisper
of
the
tiny
current
and
the
occasional
sweet
note
of
a
bird
in
brilliant
dress
pluming
itself
on
a
bough
in
its
pride
he
drew
fresh
courage
from
the
peace
of
the
woods
and
resolved
to
remain
longer
there
by
the
stream
settling
himself
into
the
bushes
and
tall
grass
until
he
was
hidden
from
all
but
a
trained
gaze
he
waited
body
and
soul
alike
growing
steadily
in
vigor
the
forest
was
in
its
finest
colors
spring
had
never
brought
to
it
a
more
splendid
robe
gorgeous
and
glowing
its
green
adorned
with
wild
flowers
and
the
bloom
of
bush
and
tree
like
a
gigantic
stretch
of
tapestry
the
great
trunks
of
oak
and
elm
and
maple
grew
in
endless
rows
and
overhead
the
foliage
gleamed
a
veil
of
emerald
lace
before
the
sun
robert
drank
in
the
glory
eye
and
ear
but
he
never
failed
to
watch
the
thickets
and
to
listen
for
hostile
sounds
he
knew
full
well
that
his
life
rested
upon
his
vigilance
and
often
as
he
had
been
in
danger
in
the
great
northern
woods
he
valued
too
much
these
precious
days
of
his
youth
to
risk
their
sudden
end
through
any
neglect
of
his
own
he
looked
now
and
then
at
the
bird
which
still
preened
itself
on
a
little
bough
when
the
shadows
from
the
waving
foliage
fell
upon
its
feathers
it
showed
a
bright
purple
but
when
the
sunlight
poured
through
it
glowed
a
glossy
blue
he
did
not
know
its
name
but
it
was
a
brave
bird
a
gay
bird
now
and
then
it
ceased
its
hopping
back
and
forth
raised
its
head
and
sent
forth
a
deep
sweet
thrilling
note
amazing
in
volume
to
come
from
so
small
a
body
had
he
dared
to
make
a
sound
robert
would
have
whistled
a
bar
or
two
in
reply
the
bird
was
a
friend
to
one
alone
and
in
need
and
its
dauntless
melody
made
his
own
heart
beat
higher
if
a
creature
so
tiny
was
not
afraid
in
the
wilderness
why
should
he
be
he
had
learned
to
take
sharp
notice
of
everything
on
the
border
and
in
such
times
man
was
compelled
to
observe
with
eye
and
ear
with
all
the
five
senses
and
often
too
with
a
sixth
sense
an
intuition
an
outgrowth
of
the
other
five
developed
by
long
habit
and
training
which
the
best
of
the
rangers
possessed
to
a
high
degree
and
in
which
the
lad
was
not
lacking
he
knew
that
the
minutest
trifle
must
not
escape
his
attention
or
the
forfeit
might
be
his
life
while
he
relaxed
his
own
care
not
at
all
he
felt
that
the
bird
was
a
wary
sentinel
for
him
he
knew
that
if
an
enemy
came
in
haste
through
the
undergrowth
it
would
fly
away
before
him
he
had
been
warned
in
that
manner
in
another
crisis
and
he
had
full
faith
now
in
the
caution
of
the
valiant
little
singer
his
trust
in
truth
was
so
great
that
he
rose
from
his
covert
and
bent
down
for
a
third
drink
of
the
clear
cool
water
then
he
stood
up
his
figure
defiant
and
took
long
deep
breaths
his
heart
now
beating
smoothly
and
easily
as
if
it
had
been
put
to
no
painful
test
still
no
sound
of
a
foe
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
the
pursuit
had
died
down
but
he
knew
enough
of
the
warriors
of
the
woods
to
make
sure
before
he
resumed
a
flight
that
would
expose
him
in
the
open
he
crept
back
into
the
thicket
burying
himself
deep
and
was
careful
not
to
break
a
twig
or
brush
a
leaf
which
to
the
unerring
eyes
of
those
who
followed
could
mark
where
he
was
hidden
well
but
yet
lying
where
he
could
see
he
turned
his
gaze
back
to
the
bird
it
was
now
pouring
out
an
unbroken
volume
of
song
as
it
swayed
on
a
twig
like
a
leaf
shaken
in
the
wind
its
voice
was
thrillingly
sweet
and
it
seemed
mad
with
joy
as
its
tiny
throat
swelled
with
the
burden
of
its
melody
robert
in
the
thicket
smiled
because
he
too
shared
in
so
much
gladness
a
faint
sound
out
of
the
far
west
came
to
him
it
was
so
slight
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
it
from
the
whisper
of
the
wind
it
barely
registered
on
the
drum
of
the
ear
but
when
he
listened
again
and
with
all
his
powers
he
was
sure
that
it
was
a
new
and
foreign
note
then
he
separated
it
from
the
breeze
among
the
leaves
and
it
seemed
to
him
to
contain
a
quality
like
that
of
the
human
voice
if
so
it
might
be
hostile
because
his
friends
willet
the
hunter
and
tayoga
the
onondaga
were
many
miles
away
he
had
left
them
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
called
by
the
whites
george
but
more
musically
by
the
indians
andiatarocte
and
there
was
nothing
in
their
plans
that
would
now
bring
them
his
way
however
welcome
they
might
be
he
could
not
hope
for
them
foes
only
were
to
be
expected
the
faint
cry
scarcely
more
than
a
variation
of
the
wind
registered
again
though
lightly
on
the
drum
of
his
ear
and
now
he
knew
that
it
came
from
the
lungs
of
man
man
the
pursuer
man
the
slayer
and
so
in
this
case
the
red
man
perhaps
tandakora
the
fierce
ojibway
chief
himself
doubtless
it
was
a
signal
one
band
calling
to
another
and
he
listened
anxiously
for
the
reply
but
he
did
not
hear
it
the
point
from
which
it
was
sent
being
too
remote
and
he
settled
back
into
his
bed
of
bushes
and
grass
resolved
to
keep
quite
still
until
he
could
make
up
his
mind
about
the
next
step
on
the
border
as
well
as
elsewhere
it
was
always
wise
when
one
did
not
know
what
to
do
to
do
nothing
but
the
tall
youth
was
keenly
apprehensive
the
signals
indicated
that
the
pursuing
force
had
spread
out
and
it
might
enclose
him
in
a
fatal
circle
his
eager
temperament
always
sensitive
to
impressions
was
kindled
into
fire
and
his
imagination
painted
the
whole
forest
scene
in
the
most
vivid
colors
a
thought
at
first
it
now
became
a
conviction
with
him
that
tandakora
led
the
pursuit
the
red
leader
had
come
upon
his
trail
in
some
way
and
venomous
from
so
many
failures
would
follow
now
for
days
in
an
effort
to
take
him
he
saw
the
huge
ojibway
again
with
all
the
intensity
of
reality
his
malignant
face
his
mighty
body
naked
to
the
waist
and
painted
in
hideous
designs
he
saw
too
the
warriors
who
were
with
him
many
of
them
and
they
were
fully
as
eager
and
fierce
as
their
chief
but
his
imagination
which
was
so
vital
a
part
of
him
did
not
paint
evil
and
danger
alone
it
drew
the
good
in
colors
no
less
deep
and
glowing
it
saw
himself
refreshed
stronger
of
body
and
keener
of
mind
than
ever
escaping
every
wile
and
snare
laid
for
his
ruin
it
saw
him
making
a
victorious
flight
through
the
forest
his
arrival
at
the
shining
lake
and
his
reunion
with
willet
and
tayoga
those
faithful
friends
of
many
a
peril
he
knew
that
if
he
waited
long
enough
he
would
hear
the
indian
call
once
more
as
the
bands
must
talk
to
one
another
if
they
carried
out
a
concerted
pursuit
and
he
decided
that
when
it
came
he
would
go
it
would
be
his
signal
too
the
only
trouble
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
might
be
too
near
when
the
cry
was
sent
yet
he
must
take
the
risk
and
there
was
his
sentinel
bird
still
pluming
itself
in
brilliant
colors
on
its
waving
bough
the
bird
sang
anew
pouring
forth
a
brilliant
tune
and
robert
from
his
covert
smiled
up
at
it
again
it
had
a
fine
spirit
a
gay
spirit
like
his
own
and
now
it
would
surely
warn
him
if
danger
crept
too
close
while
the
thought
was
fresh
in
his
mind
the
third
signal
came
and
now
it
was
so
clear
and
distinct
that
it
indicated
a
rapid
approach
but
he
was
still
unable
to
choose
a
way
for
his
flight
and
he
lingered
for
a
sign
from
the
bird
if
the
warriors
were
stealing
through
the
bushes
it
would
fly
directly
from
them
at
least
he
believed
so
and
fancy
had
so
much
power
over
him
especially
in
such
a
situation
that
belief
became
conviction
the
bird
stopped
singing
suddenly
but
kept
his
perch
on
the
waving
bough
robert
always
insisted
that
it
looked
straight
at
him
before
it
uttered
two
or
three
sharp
notes
and
then
rising
in
the
air
hovered
for
a
few
minutes
above
the
bough
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
his
call
had
come
steeped
in
indian
lore
he
had
seen
earth
and
air
work
miracles
and
it
was
not
less
wonderful
that
a
living
creature
should
perform
one
now
and
in
his
behalf
for
a
breathless
instant
or
two
he
forgot
the
warriors
and
watched
the
bird
a
flash
of
blue
flame
against
the
green
veil
of
the
forest
it
was
perched
there
in
order
to
be
sure
that
he
saw
and
then
it
would
show
the
way
with
every
pulse
beating
hard
he
stood
up
silently
his
eyes
still
on
the
blue
flash
confident
that
a
new
miracle
was
at
hand
the
bird
uttered
three
or
four
notes
not
short
or
sharp
now
but
soft
long
and
beckoning
dying
away
in
the
gentlest
of
echoes
his
imagination
as
vivid
as
ever
translated
it
into
a
call
to
him
to
come
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
the
blue
flame
like
the
pillow
of
cloud
by
day
moved
slowly
to
the
northeast
and
toward
the
lake
stepping
cautiously
he
followed
his
sign
thrilled
at
the
doing
of
the
miracle
his
eyes
on
his
flying
guide
his
ears
attuned
to
warn
him
if
any
danger
threatened
from
the
forest
so
near
it
never
occurred
to
robert
that
he
might
not
be
led
aright
his
faith
and
confidence
were
supreme
he
had
lived
too
much
with
tayoga
not
to
share
his
belief
that
the
hand
of
manitou
was
stretched
forth
now
to
lead
those
who
put
their
trust
in
him
the
blue
flame
that
was
a
living
bird
flew
slowly
on
pausing
an
instant
or
two
on
a
bough
turning
for
a
short
curve
to
right
or
left
but
always
coming
back
to
the
main
course
that
pointed
toward
andiatarocte
he
walked
beside
the
little
brook
from
which
he
had
drunk
then
across
it
and
over
a
low
hill
into
a
shallow
valley
the
forest
everywhere
but
the
undergrowth
not
too
dense
for
easy
passage
his
attentive
ear
brought
no
sound
from
either
flank
save
those
natural
to
the
woods
though
he
was
sure
that
a
hostile
call
would
come
soon
it
would
be
time
for
the
bands
to
talk
to
one
another
but
he
had
no
fear
the
supreme
intervention
had
been
made
in
his
favor
and
he
kept
his
eyes
on
his
flying
guide
they
crossed
the
valley
and
began
the
ascent
of
another
and
high
hill
rough
with
rocky
outcrops
and
a
heavy
growth
of
briars
and
vines
his
pace
became
slower
of
necessity
and
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
had
lost
the
blue
flame
but
it
always
reappeared
and
for
the
first
time
since
its
flight
from
the
bough
it
sang
a
few
notes
a
clear
melodious
treble
carrying
far
through
the
windy
forest
the
lad
believed
that
the
song
was
meant
for
him
clearly
it
said
to
him
to
follow
and
with
equal
clearness
it
told
him
that
safety
lay
only
in
the
path
he
now
traveled
he
believed
with
all
the
ardor
of
his
soul
and
there
was
no
weariness
in
his
body
as
he
climbed
the
high
hill
near
the
summit
he
heard
on
his
right
the
long
dying
indian
cry
so
full
of
menace
its
answer
to
the
left
and
then
a
third
shout
directly
behind
him
he
understood
he
was
between
the
horns
of
a
crescent
and
they
were
not
far
away
he
left
faint
traces
only
as
he
fled
but
they
had
so
much
skill
they
could
follow
with
speed
and
he
was
quite
sure
they
expected
to
take
him
this
belief
did
not
keep
his
heart
from
beating
high
they
did
not
know
how
he
was
protected
and
led
and
there
was
the
blue
flame
before
him
always
showing
him
the
way
he
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
saw
other
hills
fold
on
fold
lying
before
him
he
had
hoped
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lake
from
the
summit
but
no
glint
of
its
waters
came
and
then
he
knew
it
must
yet
be
miles
away
his
heart
sank
for
a
moment
andiatarocte
had
appealed
to
him
as
a
refuge
just
why
he
did
not
know
but
he
vaguely
expected
to
find
safety
there
perhaps
he
would
meet
willet
and
tayoga
by
its
shore
and
to
him
the
three
united
always
seemed
invincible
his
courage
was
gone
only
an
instant
or
two
then
it
came
back
stronger
than
ever
the
note
of
his
guide
clear
and
uplifting
rose
again
and
he
increased
his
speed
lest
he
be
enclosed
within
those
horns
the
far
slope
was
rocky
and
he
leaped
from
one
stony
outcrop
to
another
even
if
he
could
hide
his
trail
only
a
few
yards
it
would
be
so
much
time
gained
while
they
were
compelled
to
seek
it
he
was
forced
to
watch
his
steps
here
but
when
he
was
at
the
bottom
and
looked
up
the
blue
flame
was
still
before
him
on
it
went
over
the
next
slope
and
he
followed
at
speed
noticing
with
joy
that
the
rocky
nature
of
the
ground
continued
and
the
most
skillful
warrior
who
ever
lived
must
spend
many
minutes
hunting
his
traces
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
gaining
and
he
had
proof
of
it
in
the
fact
that
the
pursuers
now
uttered
no
cry
had
they
been
closing
in
on
him
they
would
have
called
to
one
another
in
triumph
well
for
him
that
he
was
so
strong
and
sound
of
heart
and
lung
well
for
him
too
that
he
was
borne
up
by
a
great
spirit
and
by
his
belief
that
a
supreme
power
was
working
in
his
behalf
he
felt
little
weariness
as
he
climbed
a
ridge
his
breath
was
easy
and
regular
and
his
steps
were
long
and
swift
his
guide
was
before
him
whatever
his
pace
whether
fast
or
slow
the
distance
between
them
never
seemed
to
change
the
bird
would
dart
aside
perhaps
to
catch
an
insect
but
it
always
returned
promptly
to
its
course
his
eyes
caught
a
gleam
of
silver
from
the
crest
of
the
fourth
ridge
that
he
crossed
and
he
knew
it
was
a
ray
of
sunlight
striking
upon
the
waters
of
the
lake
now
his
coveted
haven
was
not
so
far
away
and
the
great
pulses
in
his
temples
throbbed
he
would
reach
the
lake
and
he
would
find
refuge
tandakora
in
all
his
malice
would
fail
once
more
the
thought
was
so
pleasant
to
him
that
he
laughed
aloud
and
now
feeling
the
need
to
use
the
strength
he
had
saved
with
such
care
he
began
to
run
as
fast
as
he
could
it
was
his
object
to
open
up
a
wide
gap
between
himself
and
the
warriors
one
so
great
that
if
occasion
came
he
might
double
or
turn
without
being
seen
the
forest
remained
dense
a
sea
of
trees
with
many
bushes
and
clinging
vines
in
which
an
ignorant
or
incautious
runner
would
have
tripped
and
fallen
but
robert
was
neither
and
he
did
not
forget
as
he
fled
to
notice
where
his
feet
fell
his
skill
and
presence
of
mind
kept
him
from
stumbling
or
from
making
any
noise
that
would
draw
the
attention
of
possible
pursuers
who
might
have
crept
up
on
his
flank
while
they
had
only
his
faint
trail
to
guide
them
the
pursuit
was
impeded
and
as
long
as
they
did
not
see
him
his
chance
to
hide
was
far
greater
he
lost
sight
of
his
feathered
guide
two
or
three
times
but
the
bird
never
failed
to
reappear
a
brilliant
blue
flame
against
the
green
wall
of
the
wilderness
his
emblem
of
hope
leading
him
over
the
hills
and
valleys
toward
andiatarocte
now
he
saw
the
lake
from
a
crest
not
a
mere
band
of
silver
showing
through
the
trees
but
a
broad
surface
reflecting
the
sunlight
in
varied
colors
it
was
a
beacon
to
him
and
summoning
the
last
ounce
of
his
strength
and
will
he
ran
at
amazing
speed
once
more
he
heard
the
warriors
behind
him
calling
to
one
another
and
they
were
much
farther
away
his
mighty
effort
had
not
been
in
vain
his
pulses
beat
hard
with
the
throb
of
victory
not
yet
won
but
of
which
he
felt
sure
and
he
rejoiced
too
because
he
had
come
again
upon
rocky
ground
where
his
flight
left
so
little
trace
that
tandakora
himself
would
be
baffled
for
a
while
he
knew
that
the
shores
of
the
lake
at
the
point
he
was
nearing
were
comparatively
low
and
a
vague
plan
to
hide
in
the
dense
foliage
at
the
water
edge
came
into
his
mind
he
did
not
know
just
how
he
would
do
it
but
he
would
be
guided
by
events
as
they
developed
the
bird
surely
would
not
lead
him
on
unless
less
to
safety
and
no
doubt
entered
his
mind
but
it
was
highly
important
to
widen
yet
more
the
distance
between
him
and
the
warriors
and
he
still
ran
with
all
the
speed
at
his
command
the
last
crest
was
reached
and
before
him
spread
the
splendid
lake
in
its
deep
green
setting
a
glittering
spectacle
that
he
never
failed
to
admire
and
that
he
admired
even
now
when
his
life
was
in
peril
and
instants
were
precious
the
bird
perched
suddenly
on
a
bough
uttered
a
few
thrilling
notes
and
was
then
gone
a
last
blue
flash
into
the
dense
foliage
he
did
not
see
it
again
and
he
did
not
expect
to
do
so
its
work
was
done
strong
in
the
faith
of
the
wilderness
he
believed
and
always
believed
he
crouched
a
few
moments
on
a
ledge
and
looked
back
tandakora
and
his
men
had
not
yet
come
in
sight
nor
could
he
hear
them
doubtless
they
had
lost
his
trail
when
he
leaped
from
one
stone
to
another
and
were
now
looking
for
it
his
time
to
hide
if
he
were
to
have
one
was
at
hand
and
he
meant
to
make
the
most
of
the
chance
he
bent
lower
and
remained
there
until
his
breathing
became
regular
and
easy
after
his
mighty
effort
all
his
five
senses
and
the
sixth
that
was
instinct
or
divination
alert
to
every
sound
two
or
three
birds
began
to
sing
but
they
were
not
his
bird
and
he
gave
them
no
attention
a
rabbit
leaped
from
its
nest
under
the
bushes
and
ran
it
went
back
on
his
trail
and
he
considered
it
a
sure
sign
that
his
pursuers
were
yet
distant
he
might
steal
another
precious
minute
or
two
for
his
overworked
lungs
and
heart
he
knew
the
need
of
doing
everything
to
gain
a
little
more
strength
it
was
his
experience
in
border
war
and
the
stern
training
of
willet
and
tayoga
that
made
him
able
to
do
so
and
he
was
ruler
enough
of
himself
to
wait
yet
a
little
longer
than
he
had
planned
then
when
he
felt
that
tandakora
must
be
near
he
straightened
up
though
not
to
his
full
height
and
ran
swiftly
down
the
long
slope
to
the
lake
he
found
at
the
bottom
a
narrow
place
between
cliff
and
water
grown
thickly
with
bushes
and
he
followed
it
at
least
half
a
mile
until
the
shores
towered
above
him
dark
and
steep
and
the
lake
came
up
against
them
like
a
wall
he
could
go
no
farther
and
he
waded
into
a
dense
growth
of
bushes
and
weeds
where
he
stood
up
to
his
waist
in
water
and
waited
hidden
well
he
knew
that
if
the
warriors
followed
and
saw
him
he
would
have
little
opportunity
to
escape
but
the
chances
were
a
hundred
to
one
against
their
finding
him
in
such
a
covert
rock
and
water
had
blotted
out
his
trail
and
he
felt
safe
he
secured
his
belt
containing
his
smaller
weapons
and
ammunition
about
his
shoulders
beyond
touch
of
water
and
put
his
rifle
in
the
forks
of
two
bushes
convenient
to
his
hands
it
was
a
luxury
to
rest
even
if
one
did
stand
in
a
lake
the
water
was
cold
but
he
did
not
yet
feel
the
chill
and
he
listened
for
possible
sounds
of
pursuit
he
heard
after
a
while
the
calls
of
warriors
to
one
another
and
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
the
shouts
were
faint
and
moreover
they
came
from
the
crest
of
the
cliff
they
had
not
found
his
trail
down
the
slope
and
they
were
hunting
for
him
on
the
heights
he
laughed
again
with
sheer
satisfaction
he
had
been
right
rock
and
water
had
come
to
his
aid
and
he
was
too
well
hidden
even
for
the
eager
eyes
of
tandakora
and
his
warriors
to
follow
him
he
waited
a
long
time
he
heard
the
cries
nearer
him
then
farther
away
and
at
last
at
such
a
great
distance
that
they
could
barely
be
separated
from
the
lap
of
the
waters
he
was
growing
cold
now
the
chill
from
the
lake
was
rising
in
his
body
but
with
infinite
patience
bred
by
long
practice
of
the
wilderness
he
did
not
stir
he
knew
that
silence
could
be
deceptive
some
of
the
warriors
might
come
back
and
might
wait
in
a
thicket
hoping
that
he
would
rise
and
disclose
himself
thinking
the
danger
past
more
than
one
careless
wanderer
in
the
past
had
been
caught
in
such
a
manner
and
he
was
resolved
to
guard
against
the
trick
making
the
last
call
upon
his
patience
he
stood
motionless
while
the
chill
crept
steadily
upward
through
his
veins
and
muscles
he
could
see
the
surface
of
the
open
lake
through
the
veil
of
bushes
and
tall
grass
the
water
broke
in
gentle
waves
under
a
light
wind
and
kept
up
a
soft
sighing
that
was
musical
and
soothing
had
he
been
upon
dry
land
he
could
have
closed
his
eyes
and
gone
to
sleep
but
as
it
was
he
did
not
complain
since
he
had
found
safety
if
not
comfort
he
even
found
strength
in
himself
despite
his
situation
to
admire
the
gleaming
expanse
of
andiatarocte
with
its
shifting
colors
and
the
far
cliffs
lofty
and
dim
much
of
robert
life
much
of
its
most
eventful
portion
was
passing
around
this
lake
and
he
had
a
peculiar
affection
for
it
it
always
aroused
in
him
a
sense
of
beauty
of
charm
and
of
majesty
and
he
had
grown
too
to
look
upon
it
as
a
friend
and
protector
he
believed
that
it
had
brought
him
good
luck
and
he
did
not
doubt
that
it
would
do
so
again
he
looked
for
a
canoe
one
perhaps
that
might
contain
willet
and
tayoga
seeking
him
and
keeping
well
beyond
the
aim
of
a
lurking
marksman
on
the
shore
but
he
saw
no
shadow
on
the
water
nothing
that
could
be
persuaded
into
the
likeness
of
a
boat
only
wild
fowl
circling
and
dipping
and
now
and
then
a
gleam
where
a
fish
leaped
up
to
fall
swiftly
back
again
he
was
alone
and
he
must
depend
upon
himself
only
he
began
to
move
a
little
to
lift
one
foot
and
then
the
other
careful
to
make
no
splash
in
the
water
and
the
slight
exercise
checked
the
creeping
chill
encouraged
he
increased
it
stopping
at
intervals
to
listen
for
the
approach
of
a
foe
there
was
no
sound
and
he
walked
back
and
forth
a
little
presently
his
eyes
trained
to
observe
all
things
noticed
a
change
in
the
air
a
gray
tint
so
far
a
matter
of
quality
rather
than
color
was
coming
into
it
and
his
heart
leaped
with
joy
absorbed
in
his
vital
struggle
he
had
failed
to
reckon
the
passage
of
time
the
day
was
closing
and
blessed
covering
night
was
at
hand
robert
loved
the
day
and
the
sun
but
darkness
was
always
a
friend
of
those
who
fled
and
now
he
prayed
that
it
would
come
thick
and
dark
the
sun
still
hung
over
the
eastern
shores
red
and
blazing
but
before
long
it
went
down
seeming
to
sink
into
the
lake
and
the
night
that
robert
had
wished
heavy
and
black
swept
over
the
earth
then
he
left
the
water
and
stood
upon
dry
land
the
narrow
ledge
between
the
cliff
and
the
waves
where
he
took
off
his
lower
garments
wrung
them
as
nearly
dry
as
he
could
and
hanging
them
on
the
bushes
waited
for
the
wind
to
do
the
rest
his
sense
of
triumph
had
never
been
so
strong
alone
and
relying
only
upon
his
own
courage
and
skill
he
had
escaped
the
fierce
tandakora
and
his
persistent
warriors
he
could
even
boast
of
it
to
willet
and
tayoga
when
he
found
them
again
it
was
wonderful
to
feel
safe
after
great
peril
and
his
bright
imagination
climbed
the
heights
as
he
had
escaped
them
then
so
he
would
slip
always
from
the
snares
of
his
foes
it
was
this
quality
in
him
the
spirit
of
eternal
hope
that
appealed
so
strongly
to
all
who
knew
him
and
that
made
him
so
attractive
after
a
while
he
took
venison
and
hominy
from
his
knapsack
and
ate
with
content
then
he
resumed
his
clothing
now
dried
completely
by
the
wind
and
felt
that
he
had
never
been
stronger
or
more
fitted
to
cope
with
attack
the
darkness
was
intense
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
showed
through
it
only
a
fitful
gray
the
cliff
behind
him
was
now
a
black
bank
and
its
crest
could
not
be
seen
at
all
he
was
eager
to
go
but
he
still
used
the
patience
so
necessary
in
the
wilderness
knowing
that
the
longer
he
waited
the
less
likely
he
was
to
meet
the
band
of
tandakora
he
lay
down
in
a
thicket
of
tall
grass
and
bushes
resolved
not
to
start
before
midnight
and
he
felt
so
much
at
peace
that
before
he
knew
he
was
going
to
sleep
he
was
sleeping
when
he
awoke
he
felt
a
little
dismay
at
first
but
it
was
soon
gone
after
all
he
had
passed
the
time
of
waiting
in
the
easiest
way
and
no
enemy
had
come
the
moon
and
stars
were
not
to
be
seen
but
instinct
told
him
that
it
was
not
beyond
midnight
he
arose
to
go
but
a
slight
sound
came
from
the
lake
and
he
stayed
it
was
merely
the
cry
of
the
night
bird
calling
to
its
mate
one
would
have
said
but
robert
attention
was
attracted
by
an
odd
inflection
in
it
a
strain
that
seemed
familiar
he
listened
with
the
utmost
attention
and
when
it
came
a
second
time
he
was
so
sure
that
his
pulses
beat
very
fast
willet
and
tayoga
as
he
had
hoped
in
the
day
were
out
there
on
the
lake
it
had
been
foolish
of
him
to
think
they
would
come
in
the
full
sunlight
exposed
to
every
hostile
eye
it
was
their
natural
course
to
approach
in
the
dark
and
send
a
signal
that
he
would
know
he
imitated
the
call
a
soft
low
note
but
one
that
traveled
far
and
soon
the
answer
came
no
more
was
needed
the
circle
was
complete
willet
and
tayoga
were
on
the
lake
and
they
knew
that
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
waiting
he
took
a
long
breath
of
intense
relief
and
delight
tandakora
would
resume
the
search
for
him
in
the
morning
hunting
along
the
crest
and
he
might
even
find
his
way
to
the
narrow
ledge
on
which
robert
now
stood
but
the
lad
would
be
gone
across
the
waters
where
he
left
no
trail
he
saw
a
stout
young
bush
growing
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
leaning
far
out
while
he
held
on
to
it
with
one
hand
he
watched
he
did
not
repeat
the
call
one
less
cautious
would
have
done
so
but
he
knew
that
his
friends
had
located
him
already
and
he
meant
to
run
no
risk
of
telling
the
warriors
also
where
he
stood
meanwhile
he
listened
attentively
for
the
sound
of
the
paddles
but
many
long
minutes
passed
before
he
heard
the
faint
dip
dip
that
betokened
the
approach
of
willet
and
tayoga
he
never
doubted
for
an
instant
that
it
was
their
canoe
and
again
his
heart
felt
that
triumphant
feeling
surely
no
man
ever
had
more
loyal
or
braver
comrades
if
he
had
malignant
enemies
he
also
had
staunch
friends
who
more
than
offset
them
he
saw
presently
a
faint
shadow
a
deeper
dark
in
the
darkness
and
he
uttered
very
low
the
soft
note
of
the
bird
in
an
instant
came
the
answer
and
then
the
shadow
turning
glided
toward
him
a
canoe
took
form
and
shape
and
he
saw
in
it
two
figures
which
were
unmistakably
those
of
willet
and
tayoga
swinging
their
paddles
with
powerful
hands
again
he
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
because
these
two
trusty
comrades
had
come
but
it
was
absurd
ever
to
doubt
for
an
instant
that
they
would
come
he
leaned
out
from
the
tree
to
the
last
inch
and
called
in
a
penetrating
whisper
dave
tayoga
this
way
the
canoe
shifted
its
course
a
little
and
entered
the
bushes
by
the
side
of
robert
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
putting
down
their
dripping
paddles
and
stepping
out
in
the
shallow
water
in
the
dusk
the
great
figure
of
willet
loomed
up
more
than
ever
a
tower
of
strength
and
the
slender
but
muscular
form
of
tayoga
the
very
model
of
a
young
indian
warrior
seemed
to
be
made
of
gleaming
bronze
had
robert
needed
any
infusion
of
courage
and
will
their
appearance
alone
would
have
brought
it
with
them
and
we
have
found
dagaeoga
again
said
the
onondaga
in
a
whimsical
tone
no
i
have
found
you
said
robert
you
were
lost
from
me
i
was
not
lost
from
you
it
is
the
same
and
i
think
by
your
waiting
here
at
midnight
that
you
have
been
in
great
peril
so
i
have
been
and
i
may
be
yet
and
you
too
i
have
been
pursued
by
warriors
tandakora
at
their
head
i
have
not
seen
them
but
i
know
from
the
venom
and
persistence
of
the
pursuit
that
he
leads
them
i
eluded
them
by
coming
down
the
cliff
and
hiding
among
the
bushes
here
i
stood
in
the
water
all
the
afternoon
we
thought
you
might
be
somewhere
along
the
western
shore
after
we
divided
for
our
scout
about
the
lake
the
great
bear
and
i
met
as
we
had
arranged
but
you
did
not
come
we
concluded
that
the
enemy
had
got
in
the
way
and
so
we
took
from
its
hiding
place
a
canoe
which
had
been
left
on
a
former
journey
and
began
to
cruise
upon
andiatarocte
calling
at
far
intervals
for
you
he
spoke
in
his
usual
precise
school
english
and
in
a
light
playful
tone
but
robert
knew
the
depth
of
his
feelings
the
friendship
of
the
white
lad
and
the
red
was
held
by
hooks
of
steel
like
that
of
damon
and
pythias
of
old
i
think
i
heard
your
first
call
said
robert
it
was
very
loud
but
never
was
a
sound
more
welcome
nor
can
i
be
too
grateful
for
that
habit
you
have
of
hiding
canoes
here
and
there
in
the
wilderness
saved
us
all
more
than
once
it
is
merely
the
custom
of
my
people
forced
upon
us
by
need
and
i
but
follow
it
does
alter
my
gratitude
i
see
that
the
canoe
is
big
enough
for
me
too
so
it
is
dagaeoga
you
can
enter
it
take
my
paddle
and
work
the
three
adjusted
their
weight
in
the
slender
craft
and
robert
taking
willet
paddle
instead
of
tayoga
they
pushed
out
into
the
lake
while
the
great
hunter
sat
with
his
long
rifle
across
his
knees
watching
for
the
least
sign
that
the
warriors
might
be
coming
chapter
ii
the
live
canoe
robert
was
fully
aware
that
their
peril
was
not
yet
over
the
indians
too
might
have
canoes
upon
the
lake
but
he
considered
that
the
bulk
of
it
had
passed
so
his
heart
was
light
and
as
they
shot
out
toward
the
middle
of
andiatarocte
he
talked
of
the
pursuit
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
escaped
it
i
was
led
the
right
way
by
a
bird
one
that
sang
he
said
your
manitou
tayoga
sent
that
bird
to
save
me
you
do
really
believe
it
came
for
that
special
purpose
asked
the
hunter
why
not
interrupted
the
onondaga
we
do
know
that
miracles
are
done
often
my
nation
and
all
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
have
long
known
it
if
manitou
wishes
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
snatch
dagaeoga
from
his
foes
it
is
not
for
us
to
ask
his
reason
why
willet
was
silent
he
would
not
say
anything
to
disturb
the
belief
of
tayoga
he
was
never
one
to
attack
anybody
religion
besides
he
was
not
sure
that
he
did
not
believe
himself
we
know
too
continued
tayoga
devoutly
that
tododaho
the
mighty
onondaga
chief
who
went
away
to
his
star
more
than
four
hundred
years
ago
and
who
sits
there
watching
over
the
hodenosaunee
has
intervened
more
than
once
in
our
behalf
he
is
an
arm
of
manitou
and
acts
for
him
he
looked
up
the
sky
was
hidden
by
the
thick
darkness
no
ray
of
silver
or
gray
showed
anywhere
but
the
onondaga
knew
where
lay
the
star
upon
which
sat
his
patron
saint
with
the
wise
snakes
coil
on
coil
in
his
hair
he
felt
that
through
the
banks
of
mist
and
vapor
tododaho
was
watching
over
him
and
as
long
as
he
tried
to
live
the
right
way
taught
to
him
by
his
fathers
the
great
onondaga
chieftain
would
lead
him
through
all
perils
even
as
the
bird
in
brilliant
blue
plumage
had
shown
robert
the
path
from
the
pursuit
of
tandakora
the
sublime
faith
of
tayoga
never
wavered
for
an
instant
the
wind
rose
a
little
a
heavy
swell
stirred
the
lake
and
their
light
craft
swayed
with
vigor
but
the
two
youths
were
expert
canoemen
none
better
in
all
the
wilderness
and
it
shipped
no
water
the
hunter
sitting
with
his
hands
on
his
rifle
did
not
stir
nor
did
he
speak
for
a
long
time
willet
at
that
moment
shared
the
faith
of
his
two
younger
comrades
he
was
grateful
too
because
once
more
they
had
found
robert
for
whom
he
had
all
the
affection
of
a
father
the
three
reunited
were
far
stronger
than
the
three
scattered
and
he
did
not
believe
that
any
force
on
the
lakes
or
in
the
mountains
could
trap
them
but
his
questing
eyes
watched
the
vast
oblong
of
the
lake
looking
continually
for
a
sign
whether
that
of
friend
or
foe
what
did
you
find
robert
he
asked
at
last
nothing
but
the
band
of
tandakora
replied
the
lad
with
a
light
laugh
i
took
my
way
squarely
into
trouble
and
then
i
had
hard
work
taking
it
out
again
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
to
me
if
you
two
had
come
in
the
canoe
it
seems
said
the
onondaga
in
his
whimsical
precise
manner
that
a
large
part
of
our
lives
great
bear
is
spent
in
rescuing
dagaeoga
do
you
think
when
we
go
into
the
great
beyond
and
arrive
at
the
feet
of
manitou
and
he
asks
us
what
we
have
done
with
our
time
on
earth
he
will
put
it
to
our
credit
when
we
reply
that
we
consumed
at
least
ten
years
saving
dagaeoga
from
his
enemies
yes
tayoga
we
get
white
marks
for
it
because
robert
has
also
saved
us
and
there
is
no
nobler
work
than
saving
fellow
creatures
manitou
knows
also
that
it
is
hard
to
live
in
the
wilderness
and
a
man
must
spend
a
lot
of
his
time
escaping
death
look
to
the
east
tayoga
lad
and
tell
me
if
you
think
that
a
point
of
light
on
the
mountain
over
there
the
onondaga
studied
intently
the
dark
wall
of
the
east
and
presently
his
eyes
picked
out
a
dot
against
its
background
infinitesimal
like
the
light
of
a
firefly
but
not
to
be
ignored
by
expert
woodsmen
yes
great
bear
he
replied
i
see
it
is
not
larger
than
the
littlest
star
but
it
moves
from
side
to
side
and
i
think
it
is
a
signal
so
do
i
lad
the
lake
is
narrow
here
and
the
answer
if
there
be
any
will
come
from
the
west
shore
now
we
look
all
together
three
pairs
of
eyes
are
better
than
one
the
two
lads
ceased
paddling
holding
the
canoe
steady
with
an
occasional
stroke
and
began
to
search
the
western
cliffs
in
methodical
fashion
letting
the
eye
travel
from
the
farthest
point
in
the
north
gradually
toward
the
south
and
neglecting
no
place
in
the
dark
expanse
there
it
is
exclaimed
robert
almost
opposite
us
i
believe
in
the
very
cliff
at
the
point
of
which
i
lay
see
it
winking
and
blinking
away
yes
that
it
said
robert
now
i
wonder
what
those
two
lights
are
saying
to
each
other
across
lake
george
it
might
be
worth
one
while
to
know
for
they
surely
signaling
it
may
be
about
us
or
it
may
be
about
the
army
in
the
south
i
did
find
anything
but
trouble
said
robert
now
what
did
you
and
tayoga
find
plenty
traces
of
both
white
men
and
red
replied
the
hunter
the
forests
were
full
of
french
and
indians
i
think
luc
with
a
powerful
force
is
near
the
north
end
of
lake
george
and
the
marquis
de
montcalm
will
soon
be
at
ticonderoga
to
meet
us
but
we
sweep
him
away
when
our
great
army
comes
up
from
new
york
so
we
should
lad
but
the
marquis
is
an
able
general
wily
and
brave
he
showed
his
quality
at
fort
william
henry
and
we
underrate
him
though
i
am
afraid
that
what
we
do
besides
the
forest
fights
for
the
defense
it
not
like
you
to
be
despondent
dave
said
robert
i
not
lad
i
just
a
feeling
that
we
should
be
mighty
cautious
some
think
the
marquis
wo
stand
when
our
big
army
comes
but
i
do
and
i
look
for
a
great
battle
on
the
shores
of
either
george
or
champlain
and
we
win
it
said
robert
in
sanguine
tones
that
rests
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
said
willet
thoughtfully
but
we
got
to
deal
with
one
thing
at
a
time
it
our
business
now
to
escape
from
the
people
who
are
making
those
lights
wink
at
each
other
or
the
battle
wherever
it
fought
or
whoever
wins
wo
include
us
because
we
be
off
on
another
star
maybe
sitting
at
the
feet
of
tayoga
tododaho
there
another
light
on
the
west
shore
toward
the
south
said
the
onondaga
and
a
fourth
on
the
eastern
cliff
also
toward
the
south
added
robert
all
four
of
them
are
winking
now
it
seems
to
be
a
general
conversation
and
i
wish
we
could
understand
their
language
said
the
hunter
earnestly
i
thinking
however
that
they
talking
about
us
they
must
have
found
out
in
some
manner
that
we
on
the
lake
and
they
want
to
take
us
then
said
robert
it
time
for
manitou
to
send
a
heavy
mist
that
we
may
escape
in
it
manitou
can
work
miracles
for
those
whom
he
favors
said
tayoga
and
now
and
then
he
sends
them
but
oftenest
he
withholds
his
hand
lest
we
become
spoiled
and
rely
upon
him
when
we
should
rely
upon
ourselves
you
never
spoke
a
truer
word
tayoga
said
the
hunter
it
the
same
as
saying
that
heaven
helps
those
who
help
themselves
and
got
to
do
a
lot
of
work
for
ourselves
this
night
i
think
the
indian
canoes
are
already
on
andiatarocte
looking
for
us
robert
would
have
felt
a
chill
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
his
comrades
the
danger
was
unknown
mysterious
it
might
come
from
any
point
and
while
the
foe
prepared
they
must
wait
until
he
disclosed
himself
waiting
was
the
hardest
thing
to
do
i
think
we
better
stay
just
where
we
are
for
a
while
said
the
hunter
it
would
be
foolish
to
use
our
strength
until
we
know
what
we
are
using
it
for
it
certain
that
manitou
intends
to
let
us
fend
for
ourselves
because
the
night
is
lightening
which
is
a
hard
thing
for
fugitives
the
clouds
floated
away
toward
the
north
a
star
came
out
then
another
and
then
a
cluster
the
lofty
shores
on
either
side
rose
up
clear
and
distinct
no
longer
vague
black
walls
the
surface
of
the
water
turned
to
gray
but
it
was
still
swept
by
a
heavy
swell
in
which
the
canoe
rocked
willet
finally
suggested
that
they
pull
to
a
small
island
lying
on
their
right
and
anchor
in
the
heavy
foliage
overhanging
the
water
if
it
grows
much
lighter
they
be
able
to
see
us
from
the
cliffs
he
said
and
for
us
now
situated
as
we
are
the
most
important
of
all
things
is
to
hide
it
was
a
tiny
island
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
acre
in
size
but
it
was
covered
with
heavy
forest
and
they
found
refuge
among
the
long
boughs
that
touched
the
water
where
they
rested
in
silence
while
more
stars
came
out
throwing
a
silver
radiance
over
the
lake
the
three
were
silent
and
robert
watched
the
western
light
that
lay
farthest
south
it
seemed
to
be
about
two
miles
away
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
it
grow
until
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
no
longer
a
light
but
a
fire
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
he
asked
calling
the
attention
of
willet
the
hunter
looked
for
a
while
before
replying
the
fire
still
grew
and
soon
a
light
on
the
eastern
shore
began
to
turn
into
a
fire
increasing
in
the
same
manner
i
take
it
that
they
intend
to
illuminate
the
lake
at
least
this
portion
of
it
said
willet
they
have
gigantic
bonfires
casting
their
light
far
over
the
water
and
they
think
that
we
wo
be
able
to
hide
then
which
proves
that
they
are
in
great
force
on
both
shores
said
tayoga
how
does
it
prove
it
asked
robert
the
onondaga
laughed
softly
o
dagaeoga
he
said
you
speak
before
you
think
you
are
always
thinking
before
you
speak
but
perhaps
it
is
not
your
fault
manitou
gave
you
a
tongue
of
gold
and
it
becomes
a
man
to
use
that
which
he
can
use
best
it
is
very
simple
to
drag
up
the
fallen
wood
for
such
big
fires
takes
many
men
nor
would
all
of
them
be
employed
for
such
work
while
some
of
them
feed
the
flames
others
are
seeking
us
we
can
look
for
their
canoes
soon
their
plan
is
a
bad
one
for
what
they
want
to
do
said
the
hunter
a
master
mind
must
be
directing
them
i
am
confirmed
in
my
opinion
that
luc
is
there
i
been
sure
of
it
all
the
time
said
robert
it
seems
that
fate
intends
us
to
be
continually
matching
our
wits
against
his
it
a
fact
and
it
strange
how
it
come
about
said
the
hunter
thoughtfully
robert
looked
at
him
hoping
he
would
say
more
but
he
did
not
continue
the
subject
instead
he
said
that
they
know
what
they
doing
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
we
must
move
all
the
area
of
the
lake
about
us
will
be
lighted
up
soon
the
two
bonfires
were
now
lofty
blazing
pyramids
and
a
third
farther
north
began
also
to
send
its
flames
toward
the
sky
the
surface
of
the
lake
glowed
with
red
light
which
crept
steadily
toward
the
little
island
in
the
shadow
of
which
the
three
scouts
lay
it
became
apparent
that
they
had
no
time
to
waste
if
they
intended
to
avoid
being
trapped
push
out
said
willet
and
with
strong
sweeps
of
the
paddle
robert
and
tayoga
sent
the
canoe
from
the
shelter
of
the
boughs
but
they
still
kept
close
to
the
island
and
then
made
for
another
about
a
hundred
yards
south
the
glow
had
not
yet
come
near
enough
to
disclose
them
while
they
were
in
the
open
water
but
robert
felt
intense
relief
when
they
drew
again
into
the
shelter
of
trees
the
bonfire
on
the
western
shore
was
the
largest
and
despite
the
distance
he
saw
passing
before
the
flames
tiny
black
figures
which
he
knew
to
be
warriors
or
french
if
any
white
men
were
there
they
were
still
feeding
the
fire
and
the
pyramid
of
light
rose
to
an
extraordinary
height
but
robert
knew
the
peril
was
elsewhere
it
would
come
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
he
shifted
his
gaze
to
the
gray
waters
searching
everywhere
for
indian
canoes
he
believed
that
they
would
appear
first
in
the
north
and
he
scoured
the
horizon
there
from
side
to
side
trying
to
detect
the
first
black
dot
when
it
should
show
over
the
lake
the
waters
where
his
eyes
searched
were
wholly
in
darkness
an
unbroken
black
line
of
the
sky
meeting
a
heaving
surface
he
looked
back
and
forth
over
the
whole
extent
a
half
dozen
times
and
found
nothing
to
break
the
continuity
hope
that
the
warriors
of
tandakora
were
not
coming
sprang
up
in
his
breast
but
he
put
it
down
again
although
imagination
was
so
strong
in
him
he
was
nevertheless
in
moments
of
peril
a
realist
hard
experience
had
taught
him
long
since
that
when
his
life
was
in
danger
he
must
face
facts
there
another
island
about
a
half
mile
away
he
said
to
willet
do
you
think
we
better
make
for
it
now
in
a
minute
or
two
lad
if
nothing
happens
replied
the
hunter
i
like
to
see
what
coming
here
if
anything
at
all
comes
robert
turned
his
gaze
back
toward
the
north
passing
his
eyes
once
more
to
and
fro
along
the
line
where
the
dusky
sky
met
the
dusky
lake
and
then
he
started
a
little
a
dot
detached
itself
from
the
center
of
the
line
followed
quickly
by
another
another
and
others
they
were
points
infinitely
small
and
one
at
that
distance
could
have
told
nothing
about
them
from
their
appearance
only
but
he
knew
they
were
indian
canoes
they
could
be
nothing
else
it
was
certain
also
that
they
were
seeking
the
three
do
you
see
them
asked
robert
yes
and
it
a
fleet
replied
willet
they
are
lighting
up
the
lake
with
their
bonfires
and
their
canoes
are
coming
south
to
drive
us
into
the
open
there
generalship
in
this
i
think
luc
is
surely
in
command
the
hunter
expressed
frank
admiration
often
in
the
long
duel
between
them
and
the
redoubtable
french
leader
he
paid
tribute
to
the
valor
and
skill
of
luc
like
robert
he
never
felt
any
hostility
toward
him
there
was
nothing
small
about
willet
and
he
had
abundant
esteem
for
a
gallant
foe
it
time
now
to
run
for
it
again
he
said
and
it
important
to
keep
out
of
their
sight
i
think
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
swim
said
tayoga
and
let
the
canoe
carry
our
weapons
and
ammunition
and
for
us
to
hide
behind
it
as
we
done
before
you
right
lad
the
canoe
is
low
and
does
not
make
much
of
a
blur
upon
the
lake
but
if
we
are
sitting
upright
in
it
we
can
be
much
more
easily
seen
now
quick
the
word
they
took
off
all
their
outer
clothing
and
moccasins
putting
the
garments
and
their
weapons
into
the
little
craft
and
sinking
into
the
water
behind
it
pushed
out
from
the
overhanging
boughs
it
was
a
wise
precaution
when
they
reached
the
long
open
stretch
of
water
robert
felt
that
the
glow
from
the
nearest
bonfire
was
directly
upon
them
although
he
knew
that
his
fancy
made
the
light
much
stronger
than
it
really
was
the
canoe
still
merged
with
the
color
of
the
waves
which
were
now
running
freely
and
as
the
three
swam
with
powerful
strokes
sending
it
swiftly
ahead
of
them
robert
was
hopeful
that
they
would
reach
the
next
island
unseen
the
distance
seemed
to
lengthen
and
grow
interminable
and
their
pace
although
rapid
was
to
robert
like
that
of
a
snail
yet
the
longest
journey
must
come
to
an
end
the
new
island
rose
at
last
before
them
larger
than
the
others
but
like
the
rest
covered
throughout
with
heavy
forest
they
were
almost
in
its
shelter
when
a
faint
cry
came
from
the
lofty
cliff
on
the
west
it
was
a
low
whining
sound
very
distant
but
singularly
penetrating
a
sinister
note
with
which
robert
was
familiar
the
indian
war
whoop
he
recognized
it
and
understood
its
significance
warriors
had
seen
the
canoe
and
knew
that
it
marked
the
flight
of
the
three
what
do
you
think
we
better
do
he
said
we
stop
for
a
moment
or
two
at
the
island
and
take
a
look
around
us
replied
willet
they
moored
the
canoe
and
waded
to
the
shore
far
behind
them
was
the
indian
fleet
about
twenty
canoes
coming
in
the
formation
of
an
arrow
while
the
bonfires
on
the
cliffs
towered
toward
the
sky
a
rising
wind
swept
the
waves
down
and
they
crumbled
one
after
another
as
they
broke
upon
the
island
it
looks
like
a
trap
with
us
inside
of
it
said
the
hunter
that
shout
meant
that
they
seen
our
canoe
as
you
lads
know
warriors
have
already
gone
below
to
head
us
off
and
maybe
they
got
another
fleet
which
answering
their
signals
will
come
up
from
the
south
shutting
us
between
two
forces
we
are
in
their
trap
admitted
robert
but
we
can
break
out
of
it
we
been
in
traps
before
but
none
of
them
ever
held
us
so
we
can
lad
i
did
mean
to
be
discouraging
i
was
just
stating
the
situation
as
it
now
is
we
a
long
way
from
being
taken
the
path
has
been
opened
to
us
said
the
onondaga
what
do
you
mean
asked
robert
lo
dagaeoga
the
wind
grows
strong
and
it
sweeps
toward
the
south
the
way
we
were
going
i
hear
tayoga
but
i
do
understand
we
will
send
the
canoe
with
wind
and
waves
but
we
will
stay
here
put
on
a
false
scent
exclaimed
the
hunter
it
a
big
risk
but
it
the
only
thing
to
be
done
as
the
bird
saved
robert
so
the
wind
may
save
us
the
waves
are
running
pretty
fast
toward
the
south
now
and
the
canoe
will
ride
like
a
thing
of
life
they
too
far
away
to
tell
whether
we
are
in
it
it
was
a
daring
thing
to
do
but
robert
too
felt
that
it
must
be
done
and
they
did
not
delay
in
the
doing
of
it
they
took
out
their
clothing
weapons
and
ammunition
willet
gave
the
canoe
a
mighty
shove
and
it
sailed
gallantly
southward
on
the
crest
of
the
high
waves
i
feel
as
if
i
were
saying
to
a
faithful
friend
said
robert
it
more
than
a
friend
said
willet
it
an
ally
that
will
draw
the
enemy
after
it
and
leave
us
here
in
safety
if
manitou
so
wills
it
said
tayoga
it
is
for
him
to
say
whether
the
men
of
tandakora
will
pass
us
by
but
the
canoe
is
truly
alive
dagaeoga
it
skims
over
the
lake
like
a
great
bird
if
it
has
a
spirit
in
it
and
i
do
not
know
that
it
has
not
it
guards
us
and
means
to
lead
away
our
enemy
in
pursuit
of
it
quick
to
receive
impressions
robert
also
clothed
the
canoe
with
life
and
a
soul
a
soul
wholly
friendly
to
the
three
who
now
stooping
down
on
the
island
amid
the
foliage
watched
the
action
of
the
little
craft
which
seemed
in
truth
to
be
guided
by
reason
now
it
pauses
a
little
said
robert
it
beckoning
to
the
indian
fleet
to
follow
it
is
because
it
hangs
on
the
top
of
a
wave
that
is
about
to
break
said
willet
often
you
see
waves
hesitate
that
way
just
before
they
crumble
i
prefer
to
believe
with
dagaeoga
said
the
onondaga
the
canoe
is
our
ally
and
knowing
that
we
want
the
warriors
to
pass
us
it
lingers
a
bit
to
call
them
on
it
may
be
as
you
say
said
the
hunter
i
not
one
to
disturb
the
faith
of
anybody
if
the
canoe
is
alive
as
you
think
then
it
is
alive
and
all
the
better
for
us
spirits
go
into
the
bodies
of
inanimate
things
persisted
the
red
youth
and
make
them
alive
for
a
while
all
the
people
of
the
hodenosaunee
have
known
that
for
centuries
the
canoe
hesitates
and
beckons
again
said
robert
and
as
sure
as
we
are
here
the
skies
have
turned
somewhat
darker
the
warriors
in
the
fleet
or
on
the
shore
can
not
possibly
tell
the
canoe
is
empty
again
the
hand
of
manitou
is
stretched
forth
to
protect
us
said
tayoga
devoutly
it
is
he
who
sends
the
protecting
veil
and
we
shall
be
saved
we
have
to
wait
and
see
whether
the
warriors
stop
and
search
our
island
or
follow
straight
after
the
canoe
then
we
know
said
willet
they
will
go
on
said
tayoga
with
great
confidence
look
at
the
canoe
it
is
not
going
so
fast
now
why
because
it
wishes
to
tantalize
our
enemies
to
arouse
in
their
minds
a
belief
that
they
can
overtake
it
it
behaves
as
if
we
were
in
it
and
as
if
we
were
becoming
exhausted
by
our
great
exertions
with
the
paddles
its
conduct
is
just
like
that
of
a
man
who
flees
for
his
life
i
know
although
i
can
not
see
their
eyes
that
the
pursuing
warriors
think
they
have
us
now
they
believe
that
our
weakness
will
grow
heavier
and
heavier
upon
us
until
it
overpowers
us
tandakora
reckons
that
our
scalps
are
already
hanging
at
his
belt
thus
does
manitou
make
foolish
those
whom
he
intends
to
lead
away
from
their
dearest
wish
i
begin
to
think
they
really
going
to
leave
us
but
it
too
early
yet
to
tell
definitely
said
the
hunter
we
should
give
them
an
earthly
chance
to
see
us
and
for
that
reason
we
better
retreat
into
the
heart
of
the
island
we
must
leave
all
the
work
of
deception
to
the
canoe
the
great
bear
is
right
said
tayoga
manitou
will
not
help
those
who
sit
still
relying
wholly
on
him
they
drew
back
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
and
sat
down
on
a
hillock
covered
with
dense
bushes
though
from
their
place
of
hiding
they
could
see
the
water
on
all
sides
unless
the
indians
landed
on
the
island
and
made
a
thorough
search
they
would
not
be
found
meanwhile
the
canoe
was
faithful
to
its
trust
the
strong
wind
out
of
the
north
carried
it
on
with
few
moments
of
hesitation
as
it
poised
on
breaking
waves
its
striking
similitude
to
life
never
being
lost
for
an
instant
robert
began
to
believe
with
tayoga
that
it
was
in
very
fact
and
truth
alive
and
endowed
with
reason
why
not
the
iroquois
believed
that
spirits
could
go
into
wood
and
who
was
he
to
argue
that
white
men
were
right
and
red
men
wrong
his
life
in
the
forest
had
proved
to
him
often
that
red
men
were
right
and
white
men
wrong
whoever
might
be
right
the
canoe
was
still
a
tantalizing
object
to
the
pursuit
it
may
have
been
due
to
a
slight
shift
of
the
wind
but
it
began
suddenly
to
have
the
appearance
of
dancing
upon
the
waves
swinging
a
little
to
and
fro
teetering
about
but
in
the
main
keeping
its
general
course
straight
ahead
tayoga
laughed
softly
the
canoe
is
in
a
frolicsome
mood
he
said
it
has
sport
with
the
men
of
tandakora
it
dances
and
it
throws
jests
at
them
it
says
think
you
can
catch
me
but
you
can
not
why
do
you
come
so
slowly
why
do
you
hurry
i
am
here
see
i
wait
a
little
i
do
not
go
as
fast
as
i
can
because
i
wish
to
give
you
a
better
chance
ah
here
comes
the
fleet
and
here
comes
our
supreme
test
said
willet
gravely
if
they
turn
in
toward
the
island
then
we
are
lost
and
we
know
in
five
minutes
robert
heart
missed
a
beat
or
two
and
then
settled
back
steadily
it
was
one
thing
to
be
captured
by
the
french
and
another
to
be
taken
by
tandakora
he
resolved
to
fight
to
the
last
rather
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
ojibway
chief
who
knew
no
mercy
neither
of
the
three
spoke
not
even
in
whispers
as
they
watched
almost
with
suspended
breath
the
progress
of
the
fleet
the
bonfires
had
never
ceased
to
rise
and
expand
for
a
long
distance
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
lighted
up
brilliantly
the
crests
of
the
waves
near
them
were
tipped
with
red
as
if
with
blood
and
the
strong
wind
moaned
like
the
voice
of
evil
robert
felt
a
chill
in
his
blood
he
knew
that
the
fate
of
his
comrades
and
himself
hung
on
a
hair
nearer
came
the
canoes
and
in
the
glare
of
the
fires
they
saw
the
occupants
distinctly
in
the
first
boat
a
large
one
for
those
waters
containing
six
paddles
sat
no
less
a
person
than
the
great
ojibway
chief
himself
bare
as
usual
to
the
waist
and
painted
in
many
a
hideous
design
gigantic
in
reality
the
gray
night
and
the
lurid
light
of
the
fires
made
him
look
larger
accentuating
every
wicked
feature
he
seemed
to
robert
to
be
in
both
spirit
and
body
the
prince
of
darkness
himself
just
behind
tandakora
sat
two
white
men
whom
the
three
recognized
as
auguste
de
courcelles
and
françois
de
jumonville
the
french
officers
with
whom
they
had
been
compelled
to
reckon
on
other
fields
of
battle
and
intrigue
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
french
were
present
in
this
great
encircling
movement
and
robert
was
stronger
than
ever
in
his
belief
that
luc
had
the
supreme
command
i
could
reach
tandakora
from
here
with
a
bullet
whispered
willet
and
almost
i
am
tempted
to
do
it
but
the
great
bear
will
not
yield
to
his
temptation
tayoga
whispered
back
there
are
two
reasons
he
knows
that
he
could
slay
tandakora
but
it
would
mean
the
death
of
us
all
and
the
price
is
too
great
then
he
remembers
that
the
ojibway
chief
is
mine
it
is
for
me
to
settle
with
him
in
the
last
reckoning
aye
lad
you
right
either
reason
is
good
enough
we
let
him
pass
if
pass
he
means
and
i
hope
devoutly
that
he
does
the
fleet
preserving
its
formation
was
now
almost
abreast
of
the
island
and
once
robert
thought
it
was
going
to
turn
in
toward
them
the
long
boat
of
tandakora
wavered
and
the
red
giant
looked
at
the
island
curiously
but
at
the
last
moment
the
empty
canoe
far
ahead
and
dim
in
the
dark
beckoned
them
on
more
insistently
than
ever
now
the
die
is
cast
whispered
the
onondaga
tensely
in
twenty
seconds
we
shall
know
our
fate
and
i
think
the
good
spirit
that
has
gone
into
our
canoe
means
to
save
us
tandakora
said
something
to
the
french
officers
and
they
too
looked
at
the
island
but
the
fleeing
canoe
danced
on
the
crest
of
a
high
wave
and
its
call
was
potent
in
the
souls
of
white
men
and
red
alike
it
was
still
too
far
away
for
them
to
tell
that
it
was
empty
sudden
fear
assailed
them
in
the
darkness
that
it
would
escape
and
with
it
the
three
who
had
eluded
them
so
often
and
whom
they
wanted
most
to
take
tandakora
spoke
sharply
to
the
paddlers
who
bent
to
their
task
with
increased
energy
the
long
canoe
leaped
forward
and
with
it
the
others
manitou
has
stretched
forth
his
hand
once
more
and
he
has
stretched
it
between
our
enemies
and
us
said
tayoga
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
it
so
lad
said
the
hunter
his
own
voice
shaking
a
little
i
truly
believe
you
right
when
you
say
that
as
the
bird
was
sent
to
save
robert
so
a
good
spirit
was
put
into
the
canoe
to
save
us
all
who
am
i
and
who
is
anybody
to
question
the
religion
and
beliefs
of
another
man
nor
will
i
question
them
said
robert
with
emphasis
they
were
stalwart
men
in
the
indian
fleet
skilled
and
enduring
with
the
paddle
and
the
fugitive
canoe
danced
before
them
a
will
the
wisp
that
they
must
pursue
without
rest
their
own
canoes
leaped
forward
and
as
the
arrow
into
which
they
were
formed
shot
past
the
island
the
three
hidden
in
its
heart
drew
the
deep
long
breaths
of
those
who
have
suddenly
passed
from
death
to
life
we
wo
stop
said
robert
in
a
whimsical
tone
speed
ye
tandakora
speed
ye
speed
ye
de
courcelles
and
de
jumonville
of
treacherous
memory
if
you
do
hasten
the
flying
canoe
will
yet
escape
you
more
power
to
your
arms
o
ye
paddlers
bend
to
your
strokes
the
canoe
that
you
pursue
is
light
and
it
is
carried
in
the
heart
of
the
wind
you
have
no
time
to
lose
white
men
and
red
if
you
would
reach
the
precious
prize
the
faster
you
go
the
better
you
will
like
it
and
the
better
we
will
too
on
swift
canoes
on
the
imagination
of
dagaeoga
has
been
kindled
again
said
tayoga
and
the
bird
with
a
golden
note
has
gone
into
his
throat
now
he
can
talk
and
talk
much
without
ever
feeling
weariness
as
is
his
custom
at
least
i
have
something
to
talk
about
laughed
robert
i
was
never
before
so
glad
to
see
the
backs
of
anybody
as
i
am
now
to
look
at
the
backs
of
those
indians
and
frenchmen
we
wo
do
anything
to
stop
said
the
hunter
from
their
hillock
they
saw
the
fleet
sweep
on
at
a
great
rate
toward
the
south
while
the
fires
in
the
north
no
longer
necessary
to
the
indian
plan
began
to
die
the
red
tint
on
the
water
then
faded
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
became
a
solemn
gray
it
well
for
us
those
fires
sank
said
the
hunter
because
while
tandakora
has
gone
on
we
ca
live
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
on
this
little
island
we
got
to
get
to
the
mainland
somehow
without
being
seen
and
darkness
is
our
best
friend
said
robert
so
it
is
and
in
their
pursuit
of
the
canoe
our
foes
are
likely
to
relax
their
vigilance
on
this
part
of
the
lake
can
you
see
our
little
boat
now
robert
just
faintly
and
i
think
it
a
last
glimpse
i
hope
the
wind
behind
it
will
stay
so
strong
that
tandakora
will
never
overtake
it
i
should
hate
to
think
that
a
canoe
that
has
been
such
a
friend
to
us
has
been
compelled
to
serve
our
enemies
there
it
goes
leading
straight
ahead
and
now
it
gone
farewell
brave
and
loyal
canoe
now
what
do
you
intend
to
do
dave
swim
to
the
mainland
as
soon
as
those
fires
sink
a
little
more
we
have
got
to
decide
when
the
head
of
a
swimming
man
wo
show
to
chance
warriors
in
the
bushes
and
then
make
a
dash
for
it
because
if
tandakora
overtakes
the
canoe
he
be
coming
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
will
be
dark
enough
for
us
to
risk
it
said
the
onondaga
again
came
the
thick
dusk
so
necessary
to
those
who
flee
for
life
two
fires
on
the
high
cliffs
blazed
far
in
the
south
but
the
light
from
them
did
not
reach
the
island
where
the
three
lay
where
peril
had
grazed
them
before
going
on
the
water
all
about
them
and
the
nearer
shores
lay
in
shadow
the
time
to
go
has
come
said
the
hunter
we
swim
to
the
western
side
and
climb
through
that
dip
between
the
high
cliffs
how
far
would
you
say
it
is
asked
robert
about
a
half
mile
quite
a
swim
even
for
as
good
swimmers
as
we
are
when
you
consider
we
have
to
carry
our
equipment
why
not
launch
one
of
those
fallen
trees
that
lie
near
the
water
edge
and
make
it
carry
us
a
good
idea
robert
a
happy
thought
does
come
now
and
then
into
that
young
head
of
yours
dagaeoga
is
wiser
than
he
looks
said
the
onondaga
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
for
you
tayoga
retorted
young
lennox
oh
you
both
learn
laughed
willet
as
in
the
ancient
wood
everywhere
there
were
fallen
trees
on
the
island
and
they
rolled
a
small
one
about
six
inches
through
at
the
stem
into
the
lake
they
chose
it
because
it
had
not
been
down
long
and
yet
had
many
living
branches
some
with
young
leaves
on
them
there
is
enough
foliage
left
to
hide
our
heads
and
shoulders
said
willet
the
tree
will
serve
a
double
purpose
it
our
ship
and
also
our
refuge
they
took
off
all
their
clothing
and
fastened
it
and
the
arms
ammunition
and
knapsacks
of
food
on
the
tree
then
they
pushed
off
with
a
caution
from
the
hunter
that
they
must
not
allow
their
improvised
raft
to
turn
in
the
water
as
the
wetting
of
the
ammunition
could
easily
prove
fatal
with
a
prayer
that
fortune
which
had
favored
them
so
much
thus
far
would
still
prove
kind
they
struck
out
chapter
iii
in
the
cliff
it
was
only
a
half
mile
to
the
promised
land
and
robert
expected
a
quick
and
easy
voyage
as
they
were
powerful
swimmers
and
could
push
the
tree
before
them
without
trouble
when
i
reach
the
shore
and
get
well
back
of
the
lake
he
said
to
tayoga
i
mean
to
lie
down
in
a
thicket
and
sleep
hours
i
am
entitled
now
to
a
rest
that
long
dagaeoga
will
sleep
when
the
spirits
of
earth
and
air
decree
it
and
not
before
replied
the
onondaga
gravely
can
you
see
anything
of
our
foes
in
the
south
not
a
trace
then
your
eyes
are
not
as
good
as
mine
or
you
do
not
use
them
as
well
because
i
see
a
speck
on
the
water
blacker
than
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
it
is
moving
where
tayoga
look
toward
the
eastern
shore
where
the
cliff
rises
tall
and
almost
straight
ah
i
see
it
now
it
a
canoe
and
it
moving
so
it
is
dagaeoga
and
it
is
coming
our
way
did
i
not
tell
you
that
manitou
no
matter
how
much
he
favors
us
will
not
help
us
all
the
time
not
even
the
great
and
pious
tododaho
when
he
was
on
earth
expected
so
much
now
i
think
that
after
saving
you
with
the
bird
and
all
of
us
with
the
empty
canoe
he
means
to
leave
us
to
our
own
strength
and
courage
and
see
what
we
will
do
and
it
will
be
strange
if
after
being
protected
so
far
by
a
power
greater
than
our
own
we
ca
protect
ourselves
now
said
willet
gravely
the
canoe
is
coming
fast
said
tayoga
i
can
see
it
growing
on
the
water
so
it
is
and
i
infer
from
its
speed
that
it
has
at
least
four
paddles
in
it
there
no
doubt
they
are
disappointed
in
not
finding
us
farther
down
and
their
boat
has
come
back
to
look
for
us
this
is
not
the
only
tree
uprooted
by
the
wind
and
afloat
on
the
lake
said
tayoga
and
now
it
must
be
our
purpose
to
make
the
warriors
think
it
has
come
into
the
water
naturally
long
before
the
french
word
camouflage
was
brought
into
general
use
by
a
titanic
war
the
art
of
concealment
and
illusion
was
practiced
universally
by
the
natives
of
the
north
american
wilderness
it
was
in
truth
their
favorite
stratagem
in
their
unending
wars
and
there
was
high
praise
for
those
who
could
use
it
best
well
spoken
tayoga
said
willet
luckily
these
living
branches
hide
us
and
as
the
wind
still
blows
strongly
toward
the
south
we
must
let
the
tree
float
in
that
direction
and
not
go
toward
the
mainland
said
robert
aye
lad
for
the
present
it
stern
necessity
if
the
warriors
in
that
canoe
saw
the
tree
floating
against
the
wind
they
know
we
here
trust
for
that
i
think
we
about
to
run
another
gauntlet
the
trunk
now
drifted
with
the
wind
though
the
three
edged
it
ever
so
slightly
but
steadily
toward
the
shore
meanwhile
the
canoe
grew
and
grew
and
they
saw
as
willet
had
surmised
that
it
contained
four
paddles
it
was
evident
too
that
they
were
on
a
quest
as
the
boat
began
to
veer
about
and
the
four
indians
swept
the
lake
with
eager
eyes
the
tree
drifted
on
farther
to
the
west
and
near
the
shore
another
tree
was
floating
in
the
same
manner
and
off
to
the
east
a
third
was
beckoning
in
like
fashion
there
was
nothing
in
the
behavior
of
the
three
trees
to
indicate
that
one
of
them
was
different
from
the
other
two
the
eyes
of
the
savages
passed
over
them
one
after
another
but
they
saw
no
human
being
hidden
within
their
boughs
yet
robert
at
least
when
those
four
pairs
of
eyes
rested
on
his
tree
felt
them
burning
into
his
back
it
was
a
positive
relief
when
they
moved
on
and
began
to
hunt
elsewhere
they
will
yet
bring
their
canoe
much
closer
whispered
willet
too
much
to
expect
that
they
will
let
us
go
so
easily
and
we
got
to
keep
up
the
illusion
quite
a
while
longer
do
push
on
the
tree
the
wind
is
dying
a
little
and
our
pace
must
be
absolutely
the
pace
of
the
breeze
they
notice
everything
and
if
we
were
to
go
too
fast
they
be
sure
to
see
it
they
no
longer
sought
to
control
their
floating
support
and
as
the
wind
suddenly
sank
very
much
it
hung
lazily
on
the
crests
of
little
waves
it
was
a
hard
test
to
endure
while
the
canoe
with
the
four
relentless
warriors
in
it
rowed
about
seeking
them
robert
paid
all
the
price
of
a
vivid
and
extremely
brilliant
imagination
while
those
with
such
a
temperament
look
far
ahead
and
have
a
vision
of
triumphs
to
come
out
of
the
distant
future
they
also
see
far
more
clearly
the
troubles
and
dangers
that
confront
them
so
their
nerves
are
much
more
severely
tried
than
are
those
of
the
ordinary
and
apathetic
great
will
power
must
come
to
their
relief
and
thus
it
was
with
robert
his
body
quivered
though
not
with
the
cold
of
the
water
but
his
soul
was
steady
although
the
wind
sank
which
was
against
them
the
darkness
increased
and
the
fact
that
two
other
trees
were
afloat
within
view
was
greatly
in
their
favor
it
gave
them
comrades
in
that
lazy
drifting
and
diverted
suspicion
if
they
conclude
to
make
a
close
examination
of
our
tree
what
shall
we
do
whispered
robert
we
be
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
the
water
the
hunter
whispered
back
but
we
have
to
get
our
rifles
loose
from
their
lashings
and
make
a
fight
of
it
i
hoping
it
wo
come
to
that
the
canoe
approached
the
tree
and
then
veered
away
again
as
if
the
warriors
were
satisfied
with
its
appearance
certainly
a
tree
more
innocent
in
looks
never
floated
on
the
waves
of
lake
george
the
three
were
masters
of
illusion
and
deception
and
they
did
not
do
a
single
thing
to
turn
the
tree
from
its
natural
way
of
drifting
it
obeyed
absolutely
the
touch
of
the
wind
and
not
that
of
their
hands
which
rested
as
lightly
as
down
upon
the
trunk
once
the
wind
stopped
entirely
and
the
tree
had
no
motion
save
that
of
the
swell
it
wandered
idly
a
lone
derelict
upon
a
solitary
lake
robert
scarcely
breathed
when
the
canoe
was
sent
their
way
he
was
wholly
unconscious
of
the
water
in
which
he
was
sunk
to
the
shoulders
but
every
imaginative
nerve
was
alive
to
the
immense
peril
if
they
return
and
come
much
nearer
we
must
immerse
to
the
eyes
whispered
willet
then
they
would
have
to
be
almost
upon
us
before
they
saw
us
it
will
make
it
much
harder
for
us
to
get
at
our
weapons
but
we
must
take
that
risk
too
they
have
turned
said
robert
and
here
they
come
it
looked
this
time
as
if
the
savages
had
decided
to
make
a
close
and
careful
inspection
of
the
tree
bearing
directly
toward
it
and
coming
so
close
that
robert
could
see
their
fierce
painted
faces
well
and
the
muscles
rising
and
falling
on
their
powerful
arms
as
they
swept
their
paddles
through
the
water
now
he
prayed
that
the
foliage
of
the
tree
would
hide
them
well
and
he
sank
his
body
so
deep
in
the
lake
that
a
little
water
trickled
into
his
mouth
while
only
the
tips
of
his
fingers
rested
on
the
trunk
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
were
submerged
as
deeply
as
he
the
upper
parts
of
their
faces
and
their
hair
blending
with
the
water
when
he
saw
how
little
they
were
disclosed
in
the
dusk
his
confidence
returned
the
four
savages
brought
the
canoe
within
thirty
feet
but
the
floating
tree
kept
its
secret
its
lazy
drift
was
that
of
complete
innocence
and
their
eyes
could
not
see
the
dark
heads
that
merged
so
well
with
the
dark
trunk
they
gazed
for
a
half
minute
or
so
then
brought
their
canoe
about
in
a
half
circle
and
paddled
swiftly
away
toward
the
second
tree
now
tododaho
on
his
star
surely
put
it
in
their
minds
to
go
away
whispered
the
onondaga
and
i
do
not
think
they
will
come
back
again
even
so
we
ca
yet
make
haste
said
the
hunter
cautiously
if
this
tree
seems
to
act
wrong
they
see
it
though
at
a
long
distance
and
come
flying
down
on
us
the
great
bear
is
right
as
always
but
the
wind
is
blowing
again
and
we
can
begin
to
edge
in
toward
the
shore
so
we
can
now
we
push
the
tree
slowly
toward
the
right
all
together
but
be
very
gentle
robert
do
let
your
enthusiasm
run
away
with
you
if
we
depart
much
from
the
course
of
the
wind
be
after
us
again
no
matter
how
far
away
they
are
now
they
have
finished
their
examination
of
the
second
tree
said
tayoga
in
his
precise
school
english
and
now
they
are
going
to
the
third
which
will
take
them
a
yet
greater
distance
from
us
so
they
are
fortune
is
with
us
they
no
longer
felt
it
necessary
to
keep
submerged
to
the
mouth
but
drew
themselves
up
resting
their
elbows
on
the
trunk
floating
easily
in
the
buoyant
water
they
had
carefully
avoided
turning
the
tree
in
any
manner
and
their
arms
ammunition
and
packs
were
dry
and
safe
but
they
had
been
submerged
so
long
that
they
were
growing
cold
and
now
that
the
immediate
danger
seemed
to
have
been
passed
they
realized
it
i
like
lake
george
said
robert
it
a
glorious
lake
a
beautiful
lake
a
majestic
lake
the
finest
lake
i
know
but
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
want
to
live
in
its
waters
dagaeoga
is
never
satisfied
said
tayoga
he
might
have
been
sunk
in
some
shallow
muddy
lake
in
a
flat
country
but
instead
he
is
put
in
this
noble
one
with
its
beautiful
cool
waters
and
the
grand
mountains
are
all
about
him
but
this
is
the
second
time
i
been
immersed
in
a
very
short
space
tayoga
and
just
now
i
crave
dry
land
i
ca
recall
a
single
hour
or
a
single
moment
when
i
ever
wanted
it
more
than
i
do
this
instant
i
of
a
mind
with
you
in
that
matter
robert
said
the
hunter
and
if
all
continues
to
go
as
well
as
it
now
going
we
set
foot
on
it
in
fifteen
minutes
that
canoe
is
close
to
the
third
tree
and
stopped
to
look
at
it
i
think
we
can
push
a
little
faster
toward
the
land
they
ca
notice
our
slant
at
that
distance
aye
right
lads
now
the
cliffs
are
coming
much
nearer
and
they
look
real
friendly
i
see
a
little
cove
in
there
where
our
good
tree
can
land
and
it
wo
be
hard
for
us
to
find
our
way
up
the
banks
though
they
do
rise
so
high
now
steady
in
we
go
it
a
snug
little
cove
put
here
to
receive
us
be
cautious
how
you
rise
out
of
the
water
lads
those
fellows
see
like
owls
in
the
dark
and
they
trace
us
outlined
here
against
the
shore
that
it
tayoga
you
always
do
the
right
thing
we
crawl
out
of
the
lake
behind
this
little
screen
of
bushes
now
have
you
lads
got
all
your
baggage
loose
from
the
tree
yes
replied
robert
then
we
let
it
go
it
been
a
fine
tree
a
kind
tree
said
robert
and
i
no
doubt
tayoga
is
right
when
he
thinks
a
good
spirit
friendly
to
us
has
gone
into
it
they
pushed
it
off
and
saw
it
float
again
on
the
lake
borne
on
by
the
wind
then
they
dried
their
bodies
as
well
as
they
could
in
their
haste
and
resumed
their
clothing
the
hunter
shook
his
gigantic
frame
and
he
felt
the
strength
pour
back
into
his
muscles
and
veins
when
he
grasped
his
rifle
it
had
been
his
powerful
comrade
for
many
years
and
he
now
stood
where
he
could
use
it
with
deadly
effect
if
the
savages
should
come
they
rested
several
minutes
before
beginning
the
climb
of
the
cliff
and
saw
a
second
and
then
a
third
canoe
coming
out
of
the
south
evidently
seeking
them
they
pretty
sure
now
that
we
have
escaped
in
that
direction
said
willet
and
they
be
back
in
full
force
looking
for
us
we
got
off
the
lake
just
in
time
the
cliffs
towered
over
them
to
a
height
of
nearly
two
thousand
feet
but
they
began
the
ascent
up
a
slanting
depression
that
they
had
seen
from
the
lake
well
covered
with
bushes
and
they
took
it
at
ease
looking
back
occasionally
to
watch
the
futile
hunt
of
the
canoes
for
them
we
not
out
of
their
ring
yet
said
willet
they
be
carrying
on
another
search
for
us
on
top
of
the
cliffs
do
discourage
us
dave
said
robert
we
feel
happy
now
having
escaped
one
danger
and
we
wo
escape
the
other
until
we
come
to
it
perhaps
you
right
lad
we
enjoy
our
few
minutes
of
safety
while
we
can
and
the
sight
of
those
canoes
scurrying
around
the
lake
looking
for
their
lost
prey
will
help
along
our
merriment
that
true
said
robert
and
i
think
i
take
a
glance
at
them
now
just
to
soothe
my
soul
they
were
about
three
quarters
of
the
way
up
the
cliff
and
the
three
turning
at
the
same
time
gazed
down
at
a
great
height
upon
the
vast
expanse
of
lake
george
the
night
had
lightened
again
a
full
moon
coming
out
and
hosts
of
stars
sparkling
in
the
heavens
the
surface
of
the
lake
gleamed
in
silver
and
they
distinctly
saw
the
canoes
cruising
about
in
their
search
for
the
three
they
also
saw
far
in
the
south
a
part
of
the
fleet
returning
and
robert
breathed
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
that
they
had
escaped
at
last
from
the
water
they
turned
back
to
the
top
but
the
white
lad
felt
a
sudden
faintness
and
had
he
not
clung
tightly
to
a
stout
young
bush
he
would
have
gone
crashing
down
the
slope
he
quickly
recovered
himself
and
sought
to
hide
his
momentary
weakness
but
the
hunter
had
noticed
his
stumbling
step
and
gave
him
a
keen
questing
glance
then
he
too
stopped
we
climbed
enough
he
said
robert
you
come
to
the
end
of
your
rope
for
the
present
it
a
wonder
your
strength
did
give
out
long
ago
after
all
you
been
through
oh
i
can
go
on
i
not
tired
at
all
exclaimed
the
youth
valiantly
the
great
bear
tells
the
truth
dagaeoga
said
the
onondaga
looking
at
him
with
sympathy
and
you
can
not
hide
it
from
us
we
will
seek
a
covert
here
robert
knew
that
any
further
effort
to
conceal
his
sudden
exhaustion
would
be
in
vain
the
collapse
was
too
complete
but
he
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
as
he
had
gone
through
far
more
than
willet
and
tayoga
and
he
had
reached
the
limit
of
human
endurance
well
yes
i
am
tired
he
admitted
but
as
we
hanging
on
the
side
of
a
cliff
about
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
the
water
i
do
see
any
nice
comfortable
inn
with
big
white
beds
in
it
waiting
for
us
stay
where
you
are
dagaeoga
said
the
onondaga
we
will
not
try
the
summit
but
i
may
find
some
sort
of
an
alcove
in
the
cliff
a
few
feet
of
fairly
level
space
where
we
can
rest
robert
sank
down
by
the
friendly
bush
with
his
back
against
a
great
uplift
of
stone
while
willet
stood
on
a
narrow
shelf
supporting
himself
against
a
young
evergreen
tayoga
disappeared
silently
upward
the
painful
contraction
in
the
chest
of
the
lad
grew
easier
and
black
specks
that
had
come
before
his
eyes
floated
away
he
returned
to
a
firm
land
of
reality
but
he
knew
that
his
strength
was
not
yet
sufficient
to
permit
of
their
going
on
tayoga
came
back
in
about
ten
minutes
i
have
found
it
he
said
in
his
precise
school
english
it
is
not
much
but
about
three
hundred
feet
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
is
a
slight
hollow
that
will
give
support
for
our
bodies
there
we
may
lie
down
and
dagaeoga
can
sleep
his
weariness
away
camping
securely
between
our
enemies
above
and
our
enemies
below
said
robert
his
vivid
imagination
leaping
up
again
it
appeals
to
me
to
be
so
near
them
and
yet
well
hidden
especially
as
we
left
no
trail
on
this
rocky
precipice
that
they
can
follow
it
would
help
me
a
lot
if
they
were
not
so
close
laughed
the
hunter
i
do
need
your
contrasts
robert
to
make
me
rest
like
it
better
if
they
were
a
hundred
miles
away
instead
of
only
a
few
hundred
yards
but
lead
on
tayoga
and
we
say
what
we
think
of
this
inn
of
yours
when
we
see
it
the
hollow
was
not
so
bad
an
indentation
in
the
stone
extending
back
perhaps
three
feet
and
almost
hidden
by
dwarfed
evergreens
and
climbing
vines
it
was
not
visible
twenty
feet
above
or
below
and
it
would
have
escaped
any
eye
less
keen
than
that
of
the
onondaga
you
done
well
tayoga
said
willet
there
are
better
inns
in
albany
and
new
york
but
it
a
pretty
good
place
to
be
found
in
the
side
of
a
cliff
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
the
water
we
be
snug
enough
here
they
crawled
into
the
hollow
matted
the
vines
carefully
in
front
of
them
to
guard
against
a
slip
or
an
incautious
step
and
then
the
three
lay
back
against
the
wall
feeling
an
immense
relief
while
not
so
worn
as
robert
the
bones
and
muscles
of
willet
and
tayoga
also
were
calling
out
for
rest
i
glad
i
here
said
the
hunter
and
the
others
were
forced
to
laugh
at
his
intense
earnestness
robert
sank
against
the
wall
of
the
cliff
and
he
felt
an
immense
peace
the
arching
stone
over
his
head
and
the
dwarfed
evergreens
pushing
themselves
up
where
the
least
bit
of
soil
was
to
be
found
shut
out
the
view
before
them
but
it
was
as
truly
an
inn
to
him
at
that
moment
as
any
he
had
ever
entered
he
closed
his
eyes
in
content
and
every
nerve
and
muscle
relaxed
since
you
shut
down
your
lids
lad
keep
down
said
the
hunter
sleep
will
do
you
more
good
now
than
anything
else
but
robert
quickly
opened
his
eyes
again
no
he
said
i
think
i
eat
first
willet
laughed
i
might
have
known
that
you
would
remember
your
appetite
he
said
but
it
not
a
bad
idea
we
all
have
a
late
supper
they
had
venison
and
cold
hominy
from
their
knapsacks
and
they
ate
with
sharp
appetites
then
robert
let
his
lids
fall
again
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
off
to
slumberland
now
you
follow
him
tayoga
said
willet
and
i
watch
but
remember
to
awake
me
for
my
turn
said
the
onondaga
you
can
rely
upon
me
said
the
hunter
the
disciplined
mind
of
tayoga
knew
how
to
compel
sleep
and
on
this
occasion
it
was
needful
for
him
to
exert
his
will
in
an
incredibly
brief
time
he
was
pursuing
robert
through
the
gates
of
sleep
to
the
blessed
land
of
slumber
that
lay
beyond
and
the
hunter
was
left
alone
on
watch
willet
despite
his
long
life
in
the
woods
was
a
man
of
cultivation
and
refinement
he
knew
and
liked
the
culture
of
the
cities
in
its
highest
sense
his
youth
had
not
been
spent
in
the
north
american
wilderness
he
had
tasted
the
life
of
london
and
paris
and
long
use
and
practice
had
not
blunted
his
mind
to
the
extraordinary
contrasts
between
forest
and
town
he
appreciated
now
to
the
full
their
singular
situation
practically
hanging
on
the
side
of
a
mighty
cliff
with
cruel
enemies
seeking
them
below
and
equally
cruel
enemies
waiting
for
them
above
the
crevice
in
which
they
lay
was
little
more
than
a
dent
in
the
stone
wall
if
either
of
the
lads
moved
a
foot
and
the
evergreens
failed
to
hold
him
he
would
go
spinning
a
quarter
of
a
mile
straight
down
to
the
lake
the
hunter
looked
anxiously
in
the
dusk
at
the
slender
barrier
but
he
judged
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
stop
any
unconscious
movement
then
he
glanced
at
robert
and
tayoga
and
he
was
reassured
they
were
so
tired
and
sleep
had
claimed
them
so
completely
that
they
lay
like
the
dead
neither
stirred
a
particle
but
in
the
silence
the
hunter
heard
their
regular
breathing
the
years
had
not
made
willet
a
skeptic
while
he
did
not
accept
unquestioningly
all
the
beliefs
of
tayoga
neither
did
he
wholly
reject
them
it
might
well
be
true
that
earth
air
trees
and
other
objects
were
inhabited
by
spirits
good
or
bad
at
least
it
was
a
pleasing
belief
and
he
had
no
proof
that
it
was
not
true
certainly
it
seemed
as
if
some
great
protection
had
been
given
to
his
comrades
and
himself
in
the
last
day
or
two
he
looked
up
through
the
evergreen
veil
at
the
peaceful
stars
and
gave
thanks
and
gratitude
the
night
continued
to
lighten
new
constellations
swam
into
the
heavenly
blue
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
as
far
as
eye
could
range
was
a
waving
mass
of
molten
silver
the
portion
of
the
indian
fleet
that
had
come
back
from
the
south
was
passing
it
was
almost
precisely
opposite
the
covert
now
and
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
from
the
base
of
the
cliff
the
light
was
so
good
that
willet
distinctly
saw
the
paddlers
at
work
and
the
other
warriors
sitting
upright
it
was
not
possible
to
read
eyes
at
such
a
distance
but
he
imagined
what
they
expressed
and
the
thought
pleased
him
as
robert
had
predicted
the
snugness
of
their
hiding
place
with
savages
above
and
savages
below
heightened
his
feeling
of
comfort
and
safety
he
was
in
sight
and
yet
unseen
they
would
never
think
of
the
three
hanging
there
in
the
side
of
the
cliff
he
laughed
softly
under
his
breath
and
he
had
never
laughed
with
more
satisfaction
he
tried
to
pick
out
tandakora
judging
that
his
immense
size
would
disclose
him
but
the
chief
was
not
there
evidently
he
was
with
the
other
part
of
the
fleet
and
was
continuing
the
vain
search
in
the
south
he
laughed
again
and
with
the
same
satisfaction
when
he
thought
of
the
ojibway
rage
because
the
hated
three
had
slipped
once
more
through
his
fingers
an
ojibway
has
no
business
here
in
the
province
of
new
york
anyway
he
murmured
his
place
is
out
by
the
great
lakes
the
canoes
passed
on
and
after
a
while
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
the
waves
of
lake
george
even
the
drifting
trees
including
the
one
that
had
served
them
so
well
had
gone
out
of
sight
the
lake
only
expressed
peace
it
was
as
it
might
have
been
in
the
dawn
of
time
with
the
passings
of
no
human
beings
to
vex
its
surface
something
stirred
in
the
bushes
near
the
hunter
an
eagle
with
great
spread
of
wing
rose
from
a
nest
and
sailed
far
out
over
the
silvery
waters
willet
surmised
that
the
nearness
of
the
three
had
disturbed
it
and
he
was
sorry
he
had
a
kindly
feeling
toward
birds
and
beasts
just
then
and
he
did
not
wish
to
drive
even
an
eagle
from
his
home
he
hoped
that
it
would
come
back
and
after
a
while
it
did
so
settling
upon
its
nest
which
could
not
have
been
more
than
fifty
yards
away
where
its
mate
had
remained
unmoving
while
the
other
went
abroad
to
hunt
there
was
no
further
sign
of
life
from
the
people
of
the
wilderness
and
willet
sat
silent
a
long
time
dawn
came
intense
and
brilliant
he
had
hoped
the
day
would
be
cloudy
and
he
would
have
welcomed
rain
despite
its
discomfort
but
the
sun
was
in
its
greatest
splendor
and
the
air
was
absolutely
translucent
the
lake
and
the
mountains
sprang
out
sharp
and
clear
far
to
the
south
the
hunter
saw
a
smudge
upon
the
water
which
he
knew
to
be
indian
canoes
they
were
miles
away
but
it
was
evident
that
the
french
and
indians
still
held
the
lake
and
there
was
no
escape
for
the
three
by
water
there
had
been
some
idea
in
willet
mind
of
returning
along
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
to
their
own
little
boat
but
the
brilliant
day
and
the
indian
presence
compelled
him
to
put
it
away
the
sun
huge
red
and
scintillating
swung
clear
of
the
mighty
mountains
and
the
waters
that
had
been
silver
in
the
first
morning
light
turned
to
burning
gold
in
the
shining
day
far
came
near
and
objects
close
by
grew
to
twice
their
size
to
attempt
to
pass
the
warriors
in
such
a
light
would
be
like
walking
on
an
open
plain
thought
the
hunter
and
always
quick
to
decide
he
took
his
resolution
it
was
characteristic
of
david
willet
that
no
matter
what
the
situation
he
always
made
the
best
of
it
his
mind
was
a
remarkable
mingling
of
vigor
penetration
and
adaptability
if
one
had
to
wait
well
one
had
to
wait
and
there
was
nothing
else
in
it
he
sank
down
in
the
little
cove
in
the
cliff
and
rested
his
back
against
the
stony
wall
he
robert
and
tayoga
filled
it
and
his
moccasined
feet
touched
the
dwarfed
shrubs
which
made
the
thin
green
curtain
before
the
opening
he
realized
more
fully
now
in
the
intense
light
of
a
brilliant
day
what
a
slender
shelf
it
was
any
one
of
them
might
have
pitched
from
it
to
a
sure
death
below
he
was
glad
that
the
white
lad
and
the
red
lad
had
been
so
tired
that
they
lay
like
the
dead
their
positions
were
exactly
the
same
as
when
they
sank
to
sleep
they
had
not
stirred
an
inch
in
the
night
and
there
was
no
sign
now
that
they
intended
to
awake
any
time
soon
if
they
had
gone
to
the
land
of
dreams
they
were
finding
it
a
pleasant
country
and
they
were
in
no
hurry
to
return
from
it
the
giant
hunter
smiled
he
had
promised
the
onondaga
to
awaken
him
at
dawn
and
he
knew
that
robert
expected
as
much
but
he
would
not
keep
his
promise
he
would
let
nature
hold
sway
when
it
chose
to
awaken
them
it
could
and
meanwhile
he
would
do
nothing
he
moved
just
a
little
to
make
himself
more
comfortable
and
reclined
patiently
willet
was
intensely
grateful
for
the
little
curtain
of
evergreens
without
it
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
warriors
could
detect
them
even
in
the
side
of
the
lofty
cliff
only
a
few
bushes
stood
between
them
and
torture
and
death
but
they
stood
there
just
the
same
time
passed
slowly
and
the
morning
remained
as
brilliant
as
ever
he
paid
little
attention
to
what
was
passing
on
the
lake
but
he
listened
with
all
the
power
of
his
hearing
for
anything
that
might
happen
on
the
cliff
above
them
he
knew
that
the
warriors
were
far
from
giving
up
the
chase
and
he
expected
a
sign
there
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
it
came
he
heard
the
cry
of
a
wolf
and
then
a
like
cry
replying
but
he
knew
that
the
sounds
came
from
the
throats
of
warriors
he
pressed
himself
a
little
harder
against
the
stony
wall
and
looked
at
his
two
young
comrades
their
souls
still
wandered
in
the
pleasant
land
of
dreams
and
their
bodies
took
no
interest
in
what
was
occurring
here
they
did
not
stir
in
four
or
five
minutes
the
two
cries
were
repeated
much
nearer
and
the
hunter
fairly
concentrated
all
his
powers
into
the
organ
of
hearing
faint
voices
only
whispers
floated
down
to
him
and
he
knew
that
the
warriors
were
ranging
along
the
cliff
just
above
them
leaning
forward
cautiously
he
peeped
above
the
veil
of
evergreens
and
saw
two
dark
faces
gazing
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
a
brief
look
was
enough
then
he
drew
back
and
waited
chapter
iv
the
daring
attempt
willet
knew
from
their
paint
that
the
faces
looking
down
were
those
of
huron
warriors
but
he
was
quite
sure
they
had
not
seen
anything
and
that
the
men
would
soon
pass
on
it
was
impossible
even
for
the
sharpest
eyes
to
pick
out
the
three
behind
the
evergreen
screen
nevertheless
he
put
his
rifle
forward
ready
for
an
instant
shot
if
needed
but
remained
absolutely
still
waiting
for
them
to
make
the
next
move
his
sensitive
hearing
brought
down
the
faint
voices
again
and
once
or
twice
the
light
crush
of
footsteps
evidently
the
warriors
were
moving
slowly
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
talking
as
they
went
and
the
hunter
surmised
that
the
three
were
the
subject
of
their
attention
he
imagined
their
chagrin
at
the
way
in
which
the
chase
had
vanished
and
he
laughed
softly
to
think
that
he
and
the
lads
lay
so
near
their
enemies
but
invisible
and
so
well
hidden
the
voices
became
fainter
and
died
away
the
soft
crush
of
footsteps
came
no
more
and
the
world
returned
to
all
the
seeming
of
peace
without
any
trace
of
cruelty
in
it
but
willet
was
not
lured
by
such
an
easy
promise
into
any
rash
act
he
knew
the
savages
would
come
again
and
that
unbroken
vigilance
was
the
price
of
life
once
more
he
settled
himself
into
the
easiest
position
and
watched
he
had
all
the
patience
of
the
indians
themselves
to
whom
time
mattered
little
and
since
sitting
there
was
the
best
thing
to
be
done
he
was
content
to
sit
there
robert
and
tayoga
slept
on
the
morning
was
far
gone
but
they
still
rambled
happily
in
the
land
of
dreams
and
showed
no
signs
of
a
wish
to
return
to
earth
willet
thought
it
better
that
they
should
sleep
on
because
youthful
bodies
demanded
it
and
because
the
delay
which
would
be
hard
for
robert
especially
would
thus
pass
more
easily
he
was
willing
for
them
to
stay
longer
in
the
far
happy
land
that
they
were
visiting
the
sun
slowly
climbed
the
eastern
arch
of
the
heavens
the
day
lost
none
of
its
intense
vivid
quality
the
waters
of
the
lake
glowed
in
wonderful
changing
colors
now
gold
now
silver
and
then
purple
or
blue
willet
even
in
those
hours
of
anxiety
did
not
forget
to
steep
his
soul
in
the
beauty
of
lake
george
his
life
was
cast
amid
great
and
continuous
dangers
and
he
had
no
family
that
he
could
call
his
own
yet
he
had
those
whom
he
loved
and
if
he
were
to
choose
over
again
the
land
in
which
to
live
he
would
choose
this
very
majestic
land
in
which
he
now
sat
as
human
life
went
the
great
hunter
was
happy
the
sound
of
a
shot
and
then
of
a
second
came
from
the
cliff
above
he
heard
no
cry
following
them
no
note
of
the
war
whoop
and
thinking
it
over
he
concluded
that
the
shots
were
fired
by
indians
hunting
since
the
war
game
about
the
lake
had
increased
greatly
and
the
warriors
whether
attached
to
the
french
army
or
roving
at
their
own
will
relied
chiefly
upon
the
forest
for
food
but
the
reports
were
significant
the
indian
ring
about
them
was
not
broken
and
he
measured
their
own
supplies
of
venison
and
hominy
a
little
after
noon
tayoga
awoke
and
he
awoke
in
the
indian
fashion
without
the
noise
of
incautious
movements
or
sudden
words
but
stepping
at
once
from
complete
sleep
to
complete
consciousness
every
faculty
in
him
was
alive
i
have
slept
long
great
bear
and
it
is
late
he
said
but
not
too
late
tayoga
there
nothing
for
us
to
do
then
the
warriors
are
still
above
i
heard
two
shots
a
little
while
ago
i
think
they
came
from
hunters
it
is
almost
certainly
so
great
bear
since
there
is
nothing
in
this
region
for
them
to
shoot
at
save
ourselves
and
no
bullets
have
landed
near
us
yours
has
been
a
peaceful
sleep
robert
too
is
now
coming
out
of
his
great
slumber
the
white
lad
stirred
and
murmured
a
little
as
he
awoke
his
reentry
into
the
world
of
fact
was
not
quite
as
frictionless
as
that
of
his
indian
comrade
do
not
fall
down
the
cliff
while
you
stretch
yourself
dagaeoga
said
the
onondaga
i
wo
tayoga
i
no
wish
to
reach
the
lake
in
such
fashion
i
see
by
the
sun
that
it
late
what
happened
while
i
slept
two
great
attacks
by
tandakora
and
his
men
were
beaten
off
by
the
great
bear
and
myself
as
we
felt
ourselves
a
match
for
them
we
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
awaken
you
but
of
course
if
you
had
been
pushed
a
bit
harder
you
would
have
called
upon
me
i
glad
you
concluded
to
use
me
for
tipping
the
scales
of
a
doubtful
combat
to
enter
at
the
most
strenuous
moment
is
what
i
fitted
for
best
and
if
your
weapons
are
not
sufficient
dagaeoga
you
can
make
a
speech
to
them
and
talk
them
to
death
the
hunter
smiled
he
hoped
the
boys
would
always
be
willing
to
jest
with
each
other
in
this
manner
it
was
good
to
have
high
spirits
in
a
crisis
take
a
little
venison
and
hominy
lads
he
said
because
i
think
we
going
to
spend
some
time
in
this
most
spacious
and
hospitable
inn
of
ours
they
ate
and
then
were
thirsty
but
they
had
no
water
although
it
floated
peacefully
in
millions
of
gallons
below
we
dry
but
i
think
we
going
to
be
much
dryer
said
willet
we
must
go
down
one
by
one
in
the
night
for
water
said
tayoga
we
are
to
reckon
on
a
long
stay
then
said
robert
yes
said
willet
and
we
might
as
well
make
ourselves
at
home
a
great
climb
down
but
we
have
to
do
it
if
i
could
get
up
and
walk
about
it
would
be
easier
said
robert
i
think
my
muscles
are
growing
a
bit
stiff
from
disuse
the
descent
for
water
will
loosen
them
up
said
willet
philosophically
it
was
a
tremendously
long
afternoon
one
of
the
longest
that
robert
ever
spent
and
his
position
grew
cramped
and
difficult
he
found
some
relief
now
and
then
in
stretching
his
muscles
but
there
was
nothing
to
assuage
the
intense
thirst
that
assailed
all
three
robert
throat
and
mouth
were
dry
and
burning
and
he
looked
longingly
at
the
lake
that
shimmered
and
gleamed
below
them
the
waters
sparkling
in
their
brilliant
and
changing
colors
were
cool
and
inviting
they
bade
him
come
and
his
throat
grew
hotter
and
hotter
but
he
would
make
no
complaint
he
must
endure
it
in
silence
all
the
afternoon
and
all
the
next
day
too
if
they
should
be
held
there
late
in
the
afternoon
they
heard
shots
again
but
they
were
quite
sure
that
the
reports
as
before
were
due
to
indian
hunters
rogers
with
rangers
might
be
somewhere
in
the
region
of
the
lakes
but
they
did
not
think
he
was
anywhere
near
them
if
a
skirmish
was
occurring
on
the
cliff
they
would
hear
the
shouts
of
the
combatants
the
warriors
will
have
a
feast
said
tayoga
and
they
will
have
plenty
of
water
to
drink
said
robert
ruefully
you
remember
that
time
when
we
were
on
the
peak
and
we
found
the
spring
in
the
slope
but
there
is
no
spring
here
said
tayoga
we
know
that
because
we
came
up
the
cliff
there
is
no
water
for
us
this
side
of
the
lake
the
afternoon
long
as
it
was
ended
at
last
the
intense
burning
sunlight
faded
and
the
cool
grateful
shadows
came
the
three
stirred
in
the
niche
and
robert
felt
a
little
relief
but
his
throat
and
mouth
were
still
dry
and
hard
and
they
pained
him
whenever
he
talked
yet
they
forced
themselves
to
eat
a
scant
supper
although
the
food
increased
their
thirst
but
they
knew
that
without
it
their
strength
would
decrease
and
they
expected
to
obtain
water
in
the
dark
the
twilight
passed
night
came
but
they
waited
with
infinite
patience
refusing
to
move
too
soon
despite
their
great
thirst
instead
tayoga
suggested
that
he
go
to
the
crest
of
the
cliff
and
see
if
there
was
a
possible
way
out
for
them
in
that
direction
willet
agreed
and
the
onondaga
crept
up
without
sound
disappearing
in
a
few
seconds
among
the
short
bushes
that
hung
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
tayoga
was
a
trailer
of
surpassing
skill
and
he
reached
the
top
without
rustling
a
bush
or
sending
a
single
pebble
rolling
then
he
peered
cautiously
over
the
rim
and
beheld
a
great
fire
burning
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
thirty
or
forty
warriors
were
sitting
around
it
eating
he
did
not
see
tandakora
among
them
but
he
surmised
that
it
was
an
allied
band
and
that
the
ojibway
was
not
far
off
the
feast
that
the
three
had
expected
was
in
full
progress
the
hunt
had
been
successful
and
the
indians
with
their
usual
appetites
were
enjoying
the
results
they
broiled
or
roasted
great
pieces
of
deer
over
the
coals
and
then
devoured
them
to
the
last
shred
but
tayoga
saw
that
while
the
majority
were
absorbed
in
their
pleasant
task
a
half
dozen
sentinels
their
line
extending
on
either
side
of
the
camp
kept
vigilant
watch
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
three
to
pass
there
they
would
have
to
go
down
to
the
lake
for
water
and
then
hide
in
their
niche
tayoga
was
about
to
turn
back
from
the
cliff
when
he
heard
a
shout
that
he
knew
was
full
of
significance
he
understood
the
meaning
of
every
cry
and
he
translated
it
at
once
into
a
note
of
triumph
it
sounded
like
the
whoop
over
the
taking
of
a
scalp
or
the
capture
of
a
prisoner
and
his
curiosity
was
aroused
something
had
happened
and
he
was
resolved
to
see
what
it
was
several
of
the
warriors
by
the
fire
replied
to
the
whoop
and
then
it
came
again
nearer
but
with
exactly
the
same
note
that
of
triumph
the
onondaga
flattened
his
body
against
the
earth
and
drew
himself
a
little
higher
in
the
dusk
his
black
eyes
glowed
with
interest
but
he
knew
that
his
curiosity
would
soon
be
gratified
those
who
had
sent
forth
the
cry
were
swiftly
approaching
the
camp
four
warriors
came
through
the
undergrowth
and
they
were
pushing
a
figure
before
them
it
was
that
of
a
man
in
a
bedraggled
and
torn
red
uniform
his
hands
tied
behind
him
and
all
the
color
gone
from
his
face
powerful
as
was
his
tayoga
uttered
a
low
cry
of
surprise
it
was
the
young
englishman
grosvenor
a
prisoner
of
the
hostile
warriors
and
in
a
most
desperate
case
the
onondaga
wondered
how
he
had
been
taken
but
whatever
the
way
he
was
in
the
hands
of
enemies
who
knew
little
mercy
the
warriors
around
the
fire
uttered
a
universal
yell
of
triumph
when
they
saw
the
captain
and
many
of
them
ran
forward
to
meet
grosvenor
whirling
their
tomahawks
and
knives
in
his
face
and
dancing
about
as
if
mad
with
joy
it
was
a
truly
ferocious
scene
the
like
of
which
was
witnessed
thousands
of
times
in
the
great
north
american
forests
and
tayoga
softened
by
long
contact
with
high
types
of
white
men
felt
pity
the
light
from
the
great
fire
fell
directly
on
grosvenor
face
and
showed
its
pallor
it
was
evident
that
he
was
weary
through
and
through
but
he
tried
to
hold
himself
erect
and
he
did
not
flinch
when
the
sharp
blades
flashed
close
to
his
face
but
tayoga
knew
that
his
feelings
had
become
blunted
only
the
trained
forest
runner
could
keep
steady
in
the
face
of
such
threats
when
they
came
near
the
fire
one
of
the
warriors
gave
grosvenor
a
push
and
he
fell
amid
cruel
laughter
but
he
struggled
to
his
feet
again
stood
a
few
minutes
and
then
sank
down
on
a
little
hillock
where
his
captors
left
him
alone
for
the
present
tayoga
watched
him
thoughtfully
he
knew
that
his
presence
in
the
indian
camp
complicated
their
own
situation
robert
would
never
hear
of
going
away
without
an
attempt
at
rescue
and
tayoga
own
good
heart
moved
him
to
the
same
course
yet
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
take
the
young
englishman
from
the
center
of
the
indian
camp
tayoga
knew
too
what
grief
his
news
would
cause
to
young
lennox
between
whom
and
grosvenor
a
great
friendship
had
been
formed
for
the
matter
of
that
both
the
onondaga
and
the
hunter
also
were
very
partial
to
the
englishman
the
warriors
presently
untied
grosvenor
hands
and
gave
him
some
food
the
captive
ate
a
little
he
had
no
appetite
for
more
and
then
tried
to
smooth
out
his
hair
and
his
clothing
and
to
make
himself
more
presentable
he
also
straightened
his
worn
figure
and
sat
more
erect
tayoga
gave
silent
approval
here
was
a
man
he
might
be
a
prisoner
and
be
in
a
most
desperate
plight
but
he
would
present
the
best
possible
face
to
his
foes
it
was
exactly
what
an
onondaga
or
a
mohawk
warrior
would
do
and
the
young
englishman
though
he
knew
little
of
the
forest
was
living
up
to
its
traditions
if
he
has
to
die
reflected
tayoga
he
will
die
well
if
his
people
hear
that
he
has
gone
they
will
have
no
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
the
way
in
which
he
went
here
is
the
making
of
a
great
white
warrior
the
onondaga
knew
that
robert
and
willet
were
now
expecting
him
back
but
his
interest
in
grosvenor
kept
him
a
while
longer
watching
at
the
cliff
rim
he
thought
it
likely
that
tandakora
might
come
and
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
huge
ojibway
came
striding
through
the
bushes
and
into
the
circle
of
the
firelight
his
body
bare
as
usual
save
for
breech
cloth
leggins
and
moccasins
and
painted
with
the
hideous
devices
so
dear
to
the
savage
heart
the
warriors
received
him
with
deference
indicating
clearly
to
tayoga
that
they
were
under
his
authority
but
without
making
any
reply
to
their
salutation
he
strode
up
to
the
prisoner
and
folding
his
arms
across
his
mighty
breast
regarded
him
smiling
cruelly
the
onondaga
did
not
see
the
smile
but
he
knew
it
was
there
the
man
would
not
be
tandakora
if
it
were
not
in
that
savage
heart
the
chivalry
that
so
often
marked
the
indians
of
the
higher
type
found
no
place
grosvenor
worn
to
the
bone
and
dazed
by
the
extraordinary
and
fearful
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
nevertheless
straightened
up
anew
and
gave
back
defiantly
the
stare
of
the
gigantic
and
sinister
figure
that
confronted
him
then
tayoga
saw
tandakora
raise
his
hand
and
strike
the
young
englishman
a
heavy
blow
in
the
face
grosvenor
fell
but
sprang
up
instantly
and
rushed
at
the
ojibway
only
to
find
himself
before
the
point
of
a
knife
the
young
officer
stood
still
a
few
minutes
then
turned
with
dignity
and
sat
down
once
more
tayoga
knew
and
appreciated
his
feelings
he
had
suffered
exactly
the
same
humiliation
from
tandakora
himself
and
he
meant
with
all
his
soul
that
some
day
the
debt
should
be
paid
in
full
now
in
a
vicarious
way
he
took
upon
himself
grosvenor
debt
also
the
prisoner
did
not
have
experience
in
the
woods
his
great
merits
lay
elsewhere
but
he
was
the
friend
of
robert
therefore
of
tayoga
and
the
onondaga
felt
it
only
right
that
he
should
pay
for
both
tandakora
sat
down
a
warrior
handed
him
a
huge
piece
of
deer
meat
and
he
began
to
eat
all
the
others
interrupted
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
arrival
of
the
chief
resumed
the
same
pleasant
occupation
tayoga
deciding
that
he
had
seen
enough
began
to
climb
down
with
great
care
the
descent
was
harder
than
the
ascent
but
he
reached
the
niche
without
noise
and
the
sight
of
him
was
very
welcome
to
robert
and
the
hunter
who
had
begun
to
worry
over
his
absence
which
was
much
longer
than
they
had
expected
did
you
see
the
warriors
tayoga
asked
young
lennox
i
saw
them
dagaeoga
they
are
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
only
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
they
have
a
good
fire
and
they
are
eating
the
game
they
killed
in
the
day
and
there
is
no
chance
for
us
to
pass
none
dagaeoga
nor
would
we
pass
if
we
could
why
not
i
see
no
reason
for
our
staying
here
save
that
we
have
to
do
it
one
is
there
dagaeoga
whom
we
can
not
leave
a
prisoner
in
their
hands
who
it
not
black
rifle
nor
rogers
the
ranger
they
would
never
let
themselves
be
taken
no
dagaeoga
it
is
neither
of
those
but
while
i
watched
at
the
cliff
rim
i
saw
the
warriors
bring
in
that
young
englishman
grosvenor
whom
you
know
and
like
so
well
what
grosvenor
what
could
he
have
been
doing
in
this
forest
that
i
know
not
dagaeoga
save
that
he
has
been
getting
himself
captured
how
i
know
not
either
but
i
saw
him
brought
in
a
prisoner
tandakora
came
while
i
watched
and
smote
the
captive
heavily
in
the
face
with
his
hand
that
debt
i
take
upon
myself
in
addition
to
my
own
you
will
pay
both
tayoga
and
with
interest
said
the
hunter
with
conviction
but
you
were
right
when
you
assumed
that
we
could
not
go
away
and
leave
grosvenor
a
prisoner
in
their
hands
because
here
and
because
you
saw
him
your
manitou
has
laid
upon
us
the
duty
of
saving
him
robert
face
glowed
in
the
dusk
we
bound
to
see
it
that
way
he
said
we
be
disgraced
forever
with
ourselves
if
we
went
away
and
left
him
now
how
are
we
to
do
it
i
do
know
how
yet
replied
the
onondaga
but
we
must
first
go
down
to
the
water
we
forgotten
our
thirst
in
the
news
i
bring
but
it
will
soon
be
on
us
again
fiercer
and
more
burning
than
ever
and
we
must
have
all
our
strength
for
the
great
task
before
us
i
think
it
better
for
all
three
of
us
to
go
down
to
the
lake
at
once
said
willet
if
anything
happens
we
be
together
and
we
are
stronger
against
danger
united
than
separated
i
lead
the
way
it
was
a
long
and
slow
descent
every
step
taken
with
minute
care
and
as
they
approached
the
lake
robert
found
that
his
thirst
was
up
and
leaping
i
feel
that
i
could
drink
the
whole
lake
dry
he
said
do
not
do
that
dagaeoga
said
tayoga
in
his
precise
way
lake
george
is
too
beautiful
to
be
lost
we
might
swim
across
it
said
willet
looking
at
the
silvery
surface
of
the
water
unbroken
by
the
dark
line
of
any
canoe
a
way
has
opened
to
us
here
but
we
ca
follow
it
now
robert
knelt
at
the
margin
and
took
a
little
drink
first
letting
the
cool
water
moisten
his
mouth
and
throat
before
he
swallowed
it
how
grateful
it
was
how
wonderfully
refreshing
one
must
almost
perish
with
thirst
before
he
knew
the
enormous
value
of
water
and
when
it
was
found
one
must
know
how
to
drink
it
right
he
took
a
second
and
somewhat
larger
drink
then
waiting
a
while
he
drank
freely
and
as
much
as
he
wanted
strength
courage
optimism
flowed
back
into
his
veins
as
they
came
down
the
cliff
he
had
not
seen
any
way
to
rescue
grosvenor
nor
did
he
see
it
now
but
he
knew
that
they
would
do
it
his
restored
body
and
mind
would
not
admit
the
possibility
of
failure
they
remained
nearly
an
hour
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
at
the
water
edge
and
then
began
the
slow
and
painful
ascent
to
the
niche
which
they
reached
without
mishap
another
half
hour
there
and
having
examined
well
their
arms
they
climbed
to
the
cliff
rim
where
they
looked
over
and
robert
obtained
his
first
view
of
the
indian
camp
the
feasting
was
over
the
fires
had
sunk
far
down
and
most
of
the
warriors
were
asleep
but
tandakora
himself
sat
with
his
arms
across
his
chest
glowering
into
the
coals
and
a
line
of
sentinels
was
set
a
red
gleam
from
his
uniform
showed
where
grosvenor
leaning
against
a
log
had
fallen
at
last
into
a
happy
slumber
in
which
his
desperate
case
was
forgotten
for
the
time
i
confess
that
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
still
it
must
be
done
whispered
the
hunter
yes
it
must
be
done
the
onondaga
whispered
back
we
must
steal
our
friend
out
of
the
hands
of
his
enemies
neither
do
i
know
how
to
do
it
but
perhaps
tododaho
will
tell
me
see
there
is
his
star
he
pointed
to
a
great
star
dancing
in
the
sky
a
star
with
a
light
mist
across
its
face
which
he
knew
to
be
the
wise
snakes
that
lay
coil
on
coil
in
the
hair
of
the
onondaga
sage
who
had
gone
away
four
hundred
years
ago
to
his
place
in
the
heavens
and
prayed
for
a
thought
a
happy
thought
that
would
tell
him
the
way
in
a
moment
his
mind
was
in
a
state
of
high
spiritual
exaltation
an
electric
current
seemed
to
pass
from
the
remote
star
to
him
he
shut
his
eyes
and
his
face
became
rapt
in
a
few
minutes
he
opened
them
again
and
said
quietly
i
think
great
bear
that
tododaho
has
told
us
how
to
proceed
you
and
dagaeoga
must
draw
off
the
warriors
and
then
i
will
take
red
coat
from
those
that
may
be
left
behind
it
mighty
risky
since
when
great
bear
have
we
been
turned
aside
by
risks
besides
there
is
no
other
way
it
seems
that
i
ca
think
of
any
other
tayoga
unfolded
his
plan
robert
and
willet
must
steal
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
seek
to
pass
to
the
north
of
the
line
of
sentinels
if
not
detected
they
would
purposely
cause
an
alarm
and
as
a
consequence
draw
off
the
main
portion
of
the
band
then
it
was
their
duty
to
see
to
it
that
they
were
not
taken
meanwhile
tayoga
in
the
excitement
and
confusion
was
to
secure
the
release
of
grosvenor
and
they
would
flee
southward
to
the
mouth
of
a
small
creek
in
the
lake
where
robert
and
willet
after
making
a
great
turn
were
to
join
them
it
complicated
and
it
a
desperate
chance
said
willet
thoughtfully
but
i
do
see
anything
else
to
do
besides
we
have
got
to
act
quickly
being
on
the
they
wo
hold
him
long
and
you
know
the
kind
of
death
tandakora
will
serve
out
to
him
robert
shuddered
he
knew
too
well
and
knowing
so
well
he
was
ready
to
risk
his
life
to
save
his
friend
i
think
said
tayoga
that
we
had
better
wait
until
it
is
about
two
hours
after
midnight
then
the
minds
and
bodies
of
the
warriors
will
be
at
their
dullest
and
we
will
have
the
best
chance
right
tayoga
said
the
hunter
we
have
to
use
every
trifle
that
in
our
favor
can
you
see
tandakora
from
here
he
is
leaning
against
the
big
tree
asleep
i
glad
of
that
he
may
be
a
bit
confused
when
he
awakes
suddenly
and
rushes
off
after
us
full
tilt
with
nearly
all
the
warriors
if
only
two
guards
are
left
with
the
prisoner
tayoga
you
can
dispose
of
fortune
may
favor
us
provided
we
use
our
wits
and
strength
to
the
utmost
that
provision
must
always
be
made
great
bear
using
what
patience
they
could
they
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
crouched
there
until
they
judged
it
was
about
two
in
the
morning
the
night
being
then
at
its
darkest
tandakora
still
slept
against
his
tree
and
the
fires
were
almost
out
the
red
gleam
from
the
uniform
of
grosvenor
could
no
longer
be
seen
but
robert
had
marked
well
the
place
where
he
sat
and
he
knew
that
the
young
englishman
was
there
sleeping
the
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
everything
was
still
and
peaceful
after
all
we
could
escape
through
their
lines
now
whispered
robert
so
it
turns
out
said
the
hunter
but
it
looks
as
if
we
were
held
back
in
order
that
we
might
save
grosvenor
that
too
may
be
true
it
is
time
to
go
said
tayoga
farewell
great
bear
farewell
dagaeoga
may
we
meet
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
as
we
have
planned
and
may
we
be
four
who
meet
there
and
not
three
may
all
the
stars
fight
for
us
said
robert
with
emotion
and
then
he
and
willet
moved
away
among
the
bushes
leaving
tayoga
alone
at
the
cliff
rim
young
lennox
knew
that
theirs
was
a
most
perilous
venture
had
he
given
himself
time
to
think
about
it
he
would
have
seen
that
the
chances
were
about
ten
to
one
against
its
success
but
he
resolutely
closed
his
mind
against
that
phase
of
it
and
insisted
upon
hope
his
was
the
spirit
that
leads
to
success
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
odds
willet
was
first
and
robert
was
close
behind
neither
looked
back
but
they
knew
that
tayoga
would
not
move
until
the
alarm
was
given
and
they
could
flee
away
with
the
pursuit
hot
upon
their
heels
young
lennox
saw
again
that
they
could
now
have
slipped
through
the
indian
lines
but
the
thought
of
deserting
grosvenor
never
entered
his
mind
it
seemed
though
as
if
all
the
elements
of
nature
were
conspiring
to
facilitate
the
flight
of
the
hunter
and
himself
the
sentinels
whose
dusky
figures
they
were
yet
able
to
see
moved
sleepily
up
and
down
no
dead
wood
that
would
break
with
a
snap
thrust
itself
before
their
feet
the
wilderness
opened
a
way
for
them
i
think
a
warrior
or
two
may
be
watching
in
the
forest
to
the
north
of
us
whispered
willet
but
we
go
through
the
line
there
see
that
fellow
standing
under
the
tree
about
a
hundred
yards
to
the
south
he
the
one
to
give
the
alarm
but
circumstances
still
favored
them
nature
was
peaceful
when
they
wished
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
that
their
flight
should
be
detected
nothing
happened
and
the
vigilance
of
the
warriors
who
usually
watched
so
well
seemed
to
be
relaxed
robert
was
conscious
that
they
were
passing
unseen
and
unheard
between
the
sentinel
on
the
north
and
the
sentinel
on
the
south
two
hundred
yards
farther
on
and
the
hunter
brought
his
moccasin
sharply
down
upon
a
dead
stick
which
broke
with
a
sharp
snap
a
sound
that
penetrated
far
in
the
still
night
robert
glancing
back
saw
the
sentinel
on
the
south
stiffen
to
attention
and
then
utter
a
cry
of
alarm
a
shout
sufficient
to
awaken
any
one
of
the
sleeping
indians
it
was
given
back
in
an
instant
by
several
voices
from
the
camp
and
then
the
hunter
and
the
youth
sprang
to
their
task
now
we
to
run
as
we
never
run
before
exclaimed
willet
but
we
must
let
think
they
going
to
catch
us
first
sending
back
a
tremendous
shout
of
defiance
that
he
knew
would
enrage
tandakora
men
to
the
utmost
he
raced
with
long
swift
steps
through
the
forest
and
robert
was
always
close
on
his
heels
the
yells
of
the
indians
behind
them
who
pushed
forward
in
pursuit
were
succeeded
by
silence
and
robert
knew
they
now
were
running
for
their
lives
luckily
they
were
coming
into
a
country
with
which
the
hunter
had
some
acquaintance
and
turning
a
little
to
the
south
he
led
the
way
into
a
ravine
down
which
they
took
a
swift
course
after
a
mile
or
so
he
stopped
and
the
two
rested
their
lungs
and
muscles
they
ca
see
our
trail
said
the
hunter
and
have
to
depend
on
eye
and
ear
but
they
stick
to
the
chase
for
a
long
time
i
no
doubt
they
think
all
three
of
us
are
here
and
that
they
may
take
us
in
one
haul
ready
to
start
on
again
robert
my
breath
is
all
right
now
and
i
run
a
race
with
anybody
you
do
think
they
lost
us
do
you
not
likely
but
in
case
they
have
i
tell
where
we
are
he
uttered
a
shout
so
piercing
that
it
made
robert
jump
then
he
led
again
at
a
great
pace
down
the
ravine
and
a
single
cry
behind
them
showed
that
the
pursuit
was
coming
as
nearly
as
robert
could
calculate
the
warriors
were
about
three
hundred
yards
away
he
could
not
see
them
but
he
was
sure
they
would
hang
on
as
long
as
the
slightest
chance
was
left
to
overtake
willet
and
himself
they
fled
in
silence
at
least
another
mile
and
then
feeling
their
breath
grow
difficult
again
they
stopped
a
second
time
still
in
the
ravine
and
among
thick
bushes
our
flight
may
be
a
joke
on
them
as
we
intend
to
draw
them
after
us
said
robert
but
constant
running
turns
it
into
a
joke
on
us
too
i
done
so
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
in
the
last
few
days
that
i
feel
as
if
i
were
spending
my
life
dodging
here
and
there
in
the
forest
trying
to
escape
warriors
willet
laughed
dryly
it
not
the
sort
of
life
for
a
growing
youth
he
said
but
have
to
live
it
for
a
while
remember
our
task
if
they
lose
our
trail
it
our
business
to
make
find
it
again
here
another
challenge
to
he
shouted
once
more
a
long
defiant
war
cry
much
like
that
of
the
warriors
themselves
and
then
he
and
robert
resumed
their
flight
leaving
the
ravine
presently
and
taking
a
sharper
course
toward
the
south
i
think
we
have
lost
back
there
if
it
had
been
for
that
whoop
of
mine
said
willet
perhaps
it
about
time
to
lose
them
said
robert
hopefully
the
sooner
we
do
it
the
happier
i
feel
not
yet
robert
my
lad
we
must
give
tayoga
all
the
time
he
needs
for
the
work
he
trying
to
do
after
all
his
task
is
the
main
one
and
the
most
dangerous
i
think
we
can
slow
up
a
bit
here
we
have
to
save
our
breath
they
dropped
down
to
a
walk
and
took
another
deep
curve
toward
the
south
and
now
also
to
the
east
their
present
course
if
persisted
in
would
bring
them
back
to
the
lake
the
night
was
still
dark
but
their
trained
eyes
had
grown
so
used
to
it
that
they
could
see
very
well
in
the
dusk
both
were
looking
back
and
at
the
same
time
they
saw
a
shadowy
figure
appear
in
the
forest
behind
them
robert
knew
that
it
was
the
vanguard
of
the
pursuit
which
was
drawing
uncomfortably
close
at
least
for
him
a
shout
from
the
warriors
was
followed
by
a
shot
and
a
bullet
cut
its
way
through
the
leaves
near
them
i
think
we
ought
to
give
a
hint
that
they
come
too
close
at
their
peril
said
willet
and
raising
his
own
rifle
he
sent
back
an
answering
shot
which
did
not
go
astray
the
first
warrior
fell
and
others
who
had
come
forward
in
the
undergrowth
gave
back
for
the
time
they
take
the
hint
said
the
hunter
and
now
we
increase
our
speed
he
reloaded
as
they
ran
and
a
little
later
robert
sent
a
bullet
that
struck
the
mark
once
more
the
warriors
shrank
back
for
the
time
and
the
hunter
and
lad
using
their
utmost
speed
fled
toward
the
southwest
at
such
a
great
rate
that
the
pursuit
at
length
was
left
behind
and
finally
was
lost
day
found
their
foes
out
of
sight
and
two
or
three
hours
later
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
where
they
were
to
meet
tayoga
in
case
he
succeeded
and
now
the
rest
is
in
other
hands
than
ours
said
willet
forcing
themselves
to
assume
a
patience
they
could
scarcely
feel
they
sat
down
to
wait
chapter
v
tayoga
skill
they
still
had
food
left
in
their
knapsacks
and
they
ate
a
portion
drinking
afterward
from
the
creek
then
they
resumed
their
places
in
the
dense
undergrowth
where
they
could
watch
well
and
yet
remain
hidden
they
could
also
see
from
where
they
lay
the
shimmering
waters
of
andiatarocte
and
the
lake
seemed
to
be
once
more
at
peace
they
felt
satisfaction
that
they
had
completed
their
part
of
the
great
enterprise
but
their
anxiety
nevertheless
was
intense
as
willet
had
truly
said
tayoga
share
was
the
more
dangerous
and
delicate
by
far
do
you
think
he
will
come
robert
asked
after
a
long
silence
if
any
human
being
could
come
under
such
circumstances
and
bring
grosvenor
with
him
it
is
tayoga
replied
the
hunter
i
think
sometimes
that
the
onondaga
is
superhuman
in
the
forest
then
he
will
come
said
robert
hopefully
best
not
place
our
hopes
too
high
the
hours
alone
will
tell
hard
work
waiting
but
that
our
task
the
morning
drew
on
another
beautiful
day
had
dawned
but
robert
scarcely
noticed
its
character
he
was
thinking
with
all
his
soul
of
tayoga
and
grosvenor
would
they
come
willet
was
able
to
read
his
mind
he
was
intensely
anxious
himself
but
he
knew
that
the
strain
of
waiting
upon
robert
with
his
youthful
and
imaginative
mind
was
greater
he
was
bound
to
be
suffering
cruelly
we
must
give
them
time
he
said
remember
that
grosvenor
is
not
used
to
the
woods
and
ca
go
through
them
as
fast
as
we
can
we
must
have
confidence
too
we
both
know
what
a
wonder
tayoga
is
robert
sprang
suddenly
to
his
feet
what
was
that
he
exclaimed
a
sound
had
come
out
of
the
north
just
a
breath
but
it
was
not
the
wind
among
the
leaves
nor
yet
the
distant
song
of
a
bird
it
was
the
faint
howl
of
a
wolf
and
yet
robert
believed
that
it
was
not
a
wolf
that
made
it
did
you
hear
it
he
repeated
aye
lad
i
heard
it
replied
the
hunter
is
a
signal
and
is
tayoga
too
who
comes
but
whether
he
comes
alone
or
with
a
friend
i
know
not
to
tell
that
we
must
bide
here
and
see
should
not
we
send
our
answer
nay
lad
he
knows
where
we
are
this
is
the
appointed
place
and
the
fewer
signals
we
give
the
less
likely
the
enemy
is
to
get
a
hint
here
i
do
think
we
will
hear
from
tayoga
again
until
he
shows
in
person
robert
said
no
more
knowing
full
well
the
truth
of
the
words
but
his
heart
was
beating
hard
and
he
stirred
nervously
he
had
been
drawn
strongly
to
grosvenor
and
he
knew
what
a
horrible
fate
awaited
him
at
the
hands
of
tandakora
unless
the
onondaga
saved
him
nor
would
there
be
another
chance
for
interruption
by
tayoga
or
anybody
else
but
the
minutes
passed
and
he
took
courage
tayoga
had
not
yet
come
if
alone
he
would
have
arrived
by
this
time
his
slowness
must
be
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
grosvenor
with
him
more
minutes
passed
and
he
heard
steps
in
the
undergrowth
now
he
was
sure
tayoga
was
not
alone
his
moccasins
never
left
any
sound
he
stood
up
expectant
and
two
figures
appeared
among
the
bushes
they
were
tayoga
calm
his
breath
unhurried
a
faint
smile
in
his
dark
eyes
and
grosvenor
exhausted
reeling
his
clothing
worse
torn
than
ever
but
the
light
of
hope
on
his
face
robert
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
grasped
the
young
englishman
hand
thank
god
you
are
here
he
exclaimed
i
thank
god
and
i
thank
this
wonderful
young
indian
too
panted
grosvenor
it
was
a
miracle
i
had
given
up
hope
when
he
dropped
from
the
skies
and
saved
me
sit
down
and
get
your
breath
man
said
willet
then
you
can
tell
us
about
it
grosvenor
sank
upon
the
ground
and
did
not
speak
again
until
the
pain
in
his
laboring
chest
was
gone
tayoga
leaned
against
a
tree
and
robert
noticed
then
that
he
carried
an
extra
rifle
and
ammunition
the
onondaga
thought
of
everything
willet
filled
his
cap
with
water
at
the
creek
and
brought
it
to
grosvenor
who
drank
long
and
deeply
tastes
good
said
the
hunter
smiling
like
nectar
said
the
englishman
but
it
nectar
to
me
too
to
see
both
of
you
willet
and
lennox
i
do
understand
yet
how
it
happened
it
really
and
truly
a
miracle
a
miracle
mostly
of
tayoga
working
said
the
hunter
i
thought
the
end
of
everything
for
me
had
come
said
grosvenor
and
i
was
only
praying
that
it
might
not
be
harder
for
me
than
i
could
stand
when
the
alarm
was
heard
in
the
forest
and
nearly
all
the
indians
ran
off
in
pursuit
of
something
or
other
only
two
were
left
with
me
there
was
a
shot
from
the
woods
one
of
them
fell
this
wonderful
friend
of
yours
appeared
from
the
forest
wounded
the
other
who
took
to
his
heels
then
we
started
running
in
the
other
direction
and
here
we
are
it
a
marvel
and
i
do
yet
see
how
it
was
done
tayoga
marvelous
knowledge
of
the
woods
his
skill
and
his
quickness
made
the
greater
part
of
the
miracle
said
the
hunter
and
you
see
too
lieutenant
grosvenor
that
he
even
had
the
forethought
to
bring
away
with
him
the
rifle
and
ammunition
of
the
fallen
warrior
that
you
might
have
arms
now
that
you
are
strong
enough
to
bear
them
again
tayoga
without
a
word
handed
him
the
rifle
and
ammunition
and
grosvenor
felt
strength
flowing
back
into
his
body
when
he
took
them
could
you
eat
a
bite
asked
willet
i
think
i
could
now
replied
the
englishman
although
i
confess
i
had
no
appetite
up
to
the
present
my
situation
did
permit
hunger
willet
handed
him
a
piece
of
venison
and
he
ate
meanwhile
tayoga
who
seemed
to
feel
no
weariness
and
the
others
were
watching
in
a
short
time
the
hunter
announced
that
it
was
time
to
go
we
ca
afford
to
delay
here
any
longer
and
have
overtake
us
he
said
we
out
of
the
ring
now
and
it
our
affair
to
keep
out
lieutenant
grosvenor
you
can
tell
us
as
we
go
along
how
you
happened
to
be
the
prisoner
of
tandakora
it
needs
only
a
few
words
said
the
englishman
as
they
took
their
way
southward
through
the
woods
i
was
at
albany
with
a
body
of
troops
a
vanguard
for
the
force
that
we
mean
to
march
against
the
french
at
ticonderoga
i
was
sent
northward
with
ten
men
to
scour
the
country
and
in
the
woods
we
were
set
upon
suddenly
by
savage
warriors
my
troopers
were
either
killed
or
scattered
and
i
was
taken
that
was
yesterday
morning
since
then
i
have
been
hurried
through
the
forest
i
know
not
where
and
i
have
had
a
most
appalling
experience
as
i
have
said
before
i
long
since
given
up
hope
for
a
miracle
like
the
one
that
has
saved
me
what
a
horrible
creature
that
giant
indian
was
tandakora
is
all
that
you
think
him
and
more
he
been
hunting
us
too
and
when
he
comes
back
to
his
camp
he
be
after
us
all
four
again
so
that
why
we
hurry
you
in
no
bigger
hurry
than
i
am
said
grosvenor
with
attempt
at
a
smile
if
i
could
find
the
boots
i
put
them
on
tayoga
once
more
led
the
way
and
he
examined
the
forest
on
all
sides
with
eyes
that
saw
everything
robert
and
willet
were
greatly
refreshed
by
their
rest
at
the
creek
and
the
promise
of
life
that
had
been
made
again
so
wonderfully
put
new
strength
in
grosvenor
frame
so
they
were
able
to
travel
at
a
good
pace
though
the
three
listened
continually
for
any
sound
that
might
indicate
pursuit
yet
as
the
morning
progressed
there
was
no
hostile
sign
and
their
confidence
rose
robert
hoped
most
devoutly
that
they
would
soon
come
within
the
region
of
friends
while
the
french
and
indians
held
the
whole
length
of
lake
champlain
and
it
was
believed
montcalm
would
fortify
somewhere
near
ticonderoga
yet
lake
george
was
debatable
it
was
generally
considered
within
the
british
and
american
sphere
although
they
were
having
ample
proof
that
fierce
bands
of
the
enemy
roved
about
it
at
will
aside
from
the
danger
there
was
another
reason
why
he
wished
so
earnestly
for
escape
from
this
tenacious
pursuit
they
were
seeing
the
bottoms
of
their
knapsacks
one
could
not
live
on
air
and
mountain
lakes
alone
however
splendid
they
might
be
and
although
the
wilderness
usually
furnished
food
to
three
such
capable
hunters
they
could
not
seek
game
while
tandakora
and
his
savage
warriors
were
seeking
them
so
their
problem
was
in
a
sense
economic
and
could
not
be
fought
with
weapons
only
at
a
signal
from
willet
who
observed
that
grosvenor
was
somewhat
tired
they
sank
their
pace
to
a
slow
walk
and
in
about
three
hours
stopped
entirely
sitting
down
on
fallen
timber
which
had
been
heaped
in
a
windrow
by
a
passing
hurricane
they
were
still
in
dense
forest
and
had
borne
away
somewhat
from
andiatarocte
but
through
the
foliage
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
lake
rippling
peacefully
in
silver
and
blue
and
purple
once
more
i
want
to
thank
you
fellows
for
saving
me
said
grosvenor
do
mention
it
again
said
the
hunter
in
the
wilderness
we
have
to
save
one
another
now
and
then
or
none
of
us
would
live
your
turn
to
rescue
us
may
come
before
you
think
i
know
nothing
of
the
forest
i
feel
helpless
here
just
the
same
you
do
know
what
weapon
tayoga
manitou
may
place
in
your
hands
the
border
brings
strange
and
unexpected
chances
but
our
present
crisis
is
not
over
we
not
saved
yet
and
we
afford
to
relax
our
efforts
a
particle
what
is
it
tayoga
the
onondaga
rising
from
the
fallen
tree
had
gone
about
twenty
yards
into
the
forest
where
he
was
examining
the
ground
obviously
with
great
concentration
of
both
eye
and
mind
he
waited
at
least
a
minute
before
replying
then
he
said
our
friend
the
lone
ranger
black
rifle
has
passed
here
how
can
you
know
that
asked
grosvenor
in
surprise
come
and
look
at
his
traces
said
tayoga
see
where
he
has
written
his
name
in
the
earth
that
is
he
has
left
what
you
would
call
in
europe
his
visiting
card
grosvenor
looked
attentively
at
the
ground
but
he
saw
only
a
very
faint
impression
and
he
never
would
have
noticed
that
had
not
the
onondaga
pointed
it
out
to
him
it
might
have
been
left
by
a
deer
he
objected
impossible
said
tayoga
the
entire
imprint
is
not
made
but
there
is
enough
to
indicate
very
clearly
that
a
human
foot
and
nothing
else
pressed
there
here
is
another
trace
although
lighter
and
here
another
and
another
the
trail
leads
southward
but
granting
it
to
be
that
of
a
man
grosvenor
again
objected
it
might
be
that
of
any
one
of
the
thousands
who
roam
the
wilderness
the
great
red
trailer
who
had
inherited
the
forest
lore
of
countless
generations
smiled
it
is
not
any
one
of
the
thousands
and
it
could
not
be
he
said
it
is
easy
to
tell
that
the
footsteps
are
those
of
a
white
man
because
they
turn
out
and
not
in
as
do
ours
of
the
red
race
that
is
very
easy
even
dagaeoga
here
the
great
talker
knows
it
the
footsteps
are
far
apart
so
we
are
sure
that
they
are
those
of
a
tall
man
the
imprints
are
deep
proving
them
to
have
been
made
by
a
heavy
man
and
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
heel
the
impression
is
deeper
than
on
the
inner
edge
i
noticed
when
we
last
saw
black
rifle
which
was
not
long
ago
that
he
wore
moccasins
of
moose
hide
that
he
had
turned
them
outward
a
little
through
wear
and
that
a
small
strip
of
the
hardest
moose
hide
had
been
sewed
on
the
right
edge
of
each
heel
in
order
to
keep
them
level
those
strips
have
made
their
marks
here
somebody
else
might
have
put
strips
of
hide
on
his
moccasin
heels
it
is
so
but
black
rifle
is
tall
and
large
and
heavy
and
we
know
that
the
man
who
made
this
trail
is
tall
large
and
heavy
the
chances
are
a
hundred
to
one
against
the
fact
that
any
other
man
tall
large
and
heavy
with
moose
hide
strips
to
even
the
wear
of
his
moccasin
heels
has
passed
here
especially
as
this
is
within
the
range
of
black
rifle
i
know
that
it
is
he
as
truly
as
i
know
that
i
am
standing
here
of
course
said
robert
who
had
never
felt
the
slightest
doubt
of
tayoga
knowledge
what
was
black
rifle
doing
he
was
looking
for
luc
or
tandakora
because
his
trail
does
not
lead
straight
on
see
here
it
comes
and
here
again
if
black
rifle
had
been
on
a
journey
he
would
have
gone
straight
but
he
is
seeking
something
and
so
he
turns
about
ah
he
wishes
to
see
if
there
are
any
canoes
visible
on
the
lake
for
lo
the
trail
now
leads
toward
the
water
here
he
found
that
none
was
to
be
seen
and
here
he
rested
black
rifle
had
been
long
on
his
feet
two
days
and
two
nights
perhaps
because
it
takes
much
to
make
him
weary
he
sat
on
this
log
he
left
a
strand
from
the
fringe
of
his
buckskin
hunting
shirt
caught
on
a
splinter
do
you
not
see
it
lieutenant
grosvenor
now
that
you
hold
it
up
before
my
eyes
i
notice
it
but
i
should
never
have
found
it
in
the
wilderness
minute
observation
is
what
every
trailer
has
to
learn
said
willet
else
you
are
no
trailer
at
all
and
you
learn
lieutenant
while
you
are
with
us
that
tayoga
is
probably
the
greatest
trailer
the
world
has
ever
produced
peace
great
bear
peace
protested
the
onondaga
it
so
just
the
same
now
what
did
black
rifle
do
after
he
rested
himself
on
the
log
he
went
back
farther
into
the
woods
turning
away
from
the
lake
replied
tayoga
and
he
sat
down
again
on
another
fallen
log
black
rifle
was
hungry
and
he
ate
here
is
the
small
bone
of
a
deer
picked
quite
clean
lying
on
the
ground
by
the
log
black
rifle
was
a
fortunate
man
he
had
bread
too
see
here
is
a
crumb
in
this
crack
in
the
log
too
deep
down
for
any
bird
to
reach
with
his
bill
black
rifle
sat
here
quite
a
long
time
he
was
thinking
hard
he
did
not
need
so
much
time
for
resting
he
remained
sitting
on
the
log
while
he
was
trying
to
decide
what
he
would
do
it
is
likely
that
black
rifle
thought
a
great
force
was
behind
him
and
he
turned
back
to
see
had
he
kept
straight
on
toward
the
south
as
he
was
going
at
first
he
would
not
have
needed
so
much
time
for
thinking
over
his
plans
ah
he
has
turned
lo
his
trail
goes
almost
directly
back
on
his
own
course
it
will
lead
to
the
top
of
the
hillock
there
because
he
wants
to
see
far
and
i
think
that
after
seeing
he
will
turn
again
and
follow
his
original
course
why
do
you
think
that
asked
grosvenor
because
o
red
coat
it
is
likely
that
black
rifle
knew
from
the
first
which
way
he
wanted
to
go
and
went
that
way
he
has
merely
turned
back
like
a
wise
general
to
scout
a
little
and
see
that
no
danger
comes
from
the
rear
yes
he
stood
here
on
the
hillock
from
which
we
can
get
a
good
view
over
the
country
and
walked
to
every
side
of
the
crest
to
find
where
the
best
view
could
be
obtained
that
red
coat
is
the
simplest
of
all
things
behold
the
traces
of
his
moccasins
as
he
walked
from
side
to
side
nothing
else
could
have
made
black
rifle
move
about
so
much
in
the
space
of
a
few
square
yards
now
he
leaves
the
hillock
and
goes
down
its
side
toward
a
low
valley
in
which
runs
a
brook
black
rifle
is
thirsty
and
will
drink
deep
that
you
ca
possibly
know
tayoga
but
i
do
know
it
red
coat
you
do
even
know
a
brook
is
near
i
know
it
because
i
have
seen
it
my
eyes
are
trained
to
the
forest
and
i
caught
the
gleam
of
running
water
through
the
leaves
to
the
west
running
water
of
course
means
a
brook
black
rifle
trail
now
leads
toward
it
and
i
assume
that
he
was
thirsty
because
he
had
just
eaten
well
we
are
nearly
always
thirsty
after
eating
but
we
shall
see
whether
i
am
right
here
is
the
brook
and
there
are
the
faint
traces
made
by
black
rifle
knees
when
he
knelt
to
reach
the
water
he
started
away
but
found
that
he
was
still
thirsty
so
he
came
back
and
drank
again
here
are
his
footprints
about
a
yard
from
the
others
this
time
he
will
go
back
toward
the
south
and
i
think
it
is
sure
that
he
is
looking
for
luc
who
must
have
gone
in
that
direction
with
a
strong
force
tandakora
having
stayed
behind
to
take
us
it
is
likely
that
black
rifle
went
on
because
a
great
british
and
american
army
is
gathering
below
which
fact
he
knows
well
and
it
is
probable
that
black
rifle
follows
luc
because
he
will
hunt
the
biggest
game
grosvenor
eyes
sparkled
i
understand
he
said
it
is
a
great
art
that
of
trailing
through
the
wilderness
and
i
can
see
how
circumstances
compel
you
to
learn
it
we
have
to
learn
it
to
live
said
the
hunter
gravely
but
with
tayoga
it
is
an
art
carried
to
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
he
was
born
with
a
gift
for
it
a
very
great
gift
he
inherited
all
the
learning
accumulated
by
a
thousand
years
of
ancestors
and
then
he
added
to
it
by
his
own
supreme
efforts
do
not
believe
all
that
great
bear
tells
you
said
tayoga
modestly
for
unknown
reasons
he
is
partial
to
me
and
enlarges
my
small
merits
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
place
for
all
of
you
to
wait
while
i
went
back
on
the
trail
a
piece
said
the
hunter
if
black
rifle
found
it
necessary
to
cover
the
rear
it
a
much
more
urgent
duty
for
us
who
know
that
we
been
followed
by
tandakora
to
do
the
same
the
great
bear
is
always
wise
said
tayoga
we
will
take
our
ease
while
we
await
him
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
turf
and
relaxed
his
figure
completely
he
had
learned
long
since
to
make
the
most
of
every
passing
minute
and
seeing
robert
imitate
him
exactly
grosvenor
did
likewise
the
hunter
had
disappeared
already
in
the
bushes
and
the
three
lay
in
silence
grosvenor
felt
an
immense
peace
brave
as
a
young
lion
he
had
been
overwhelmed
nevertheless
by
his
appalling
experiences
and
his
sudden
rescue
where
rescue
seemed
impossible
had
taken
him
back
to
the
heights
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
three
and
especially
the
onondaga
could
do
everything
tayoga
skill
as
a
trailer
and
scout
was
so
marvelous
that
no
enemy
could
come
anywhere
near
without
his
knowledge
the
young
englishman
felt
that
he
was
defended
by
impassable
walls
and
he
was
so
free
from
apprehension
that
his
nerves
became
absolutely
quiet
then
worn
nature
took
its
toll
and
his
eyelids
drooped
before
he
was
aware
that
he
was
sleepy
he
was
asleep
you
might
do
as
red
coat
has
done
dagaeoga
said
tayoga
i
can
watch
for
us
all
and
it
is
wise
in
the
forest
to
take
sleep
when
we
can
i
try
said
robert
and
he
tried
so
successfully
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
too
slumbered
with
his
figure
outstretched
and
his
head
on
his
arm
tayoga
made
a
circle
about
three
hundred
yards
in
diameter
about
them
but
finding
no
hostile
sign
came
back
and
lay
on
the
turf
near
them
he
relaxed
his
figure
again
and
closed
his
eyes
which
may
have
seemed
strange
but
which
was
not
so
in
the
case
of
tayoga
his
hearing
was
extraordinarily
acute
and
when
his
eyes
were
shut
it
grew
much
stronger
than
ever
now
he
knew
that
no
warrior
could
come
within
rifle
shot
of
them
without
his
ears
telling
him
of
the
savage
approach
every
creeping
footstep
would
be
registered
upon
that
delicate
drum
with
eyes
shut
and
brain
rested
tayoga
nevertheless
knew
all
that
was
going
on
near
him
that
eardrum
of
infinite
delicacy
told
him
that
a
woodpecker
was
tapping
on
a
tree
well
toward
the
north
that
a
little
gray
bird
almost
as
far
to
the
south
was
singing
with
great
vigor
and
sweetness
that
a
rabbit
was
hopping
about
in
the
undergrowth
curious
and
yet
fearful
that
an
eagle
with
a
faint
whirr
of
wings
had
alighted
on
a
bough
and
was
looking
at
the
three
that
the
eagle
thinking
they
might
be
dangerous
had
unfolded
his
wings
again
and
was
flying
away
that
a
deer
passing
to
the
west
had
caught
a
whiff
of
them
on
the
wind
and
was
running
with
all
speed
in
the
other
direction
that
a
lynx
had
climbed
a
tree
and
after
staring
at
them
had
climbed
down
again
and
had
fled
his
coward
heart
filled
with
terror
thus
tayoga
with
his
ears
watched
his
world
he
too
his
eyelids
lowered
felt
a
peace
that
was
soothing
and
almost
dreamy
but
though
his
body
relaxed
those
wonderfully
sensitive
drums
of
his
ears
caught
and
registered
everything
the
record
showed
that
for
nearly
two
hours
the
life
of
the
wilderness
went
on
as
usual
the
ordinary
work
and
play
of
animal
and
bird
and
then
the
drums
told
him
that
man
was
coming
a
footstep
was
registered
very
clearly
and
then
another
and
another
but
tayoga
did
not
open
his
eyes
he
knew
who
was
coming
as
well
as
if
he
had
seen
him
the
drums
of
his
ears
made
signals
that
his
mind
recognized
at
once
he
had
long
known
the
faint
sound
of
those
footsteps
willet
was
coming
back
tayoga
through
the
faculty
of
hearing
was
aware
of
much
more
than
the
mere
fact
that
the
hunter
was
returning
he
knew
that
willet
had
found
nothing
that
the
pursuit
was
still
far
away
and
that
they
were
in
no
immediate
danger
he
knew
it
by
his
easy
regular
walk
free
from
either
haste
or
lagging
delay
he
knew
it
by
the
straight
direct
line
he
took
for
the
three
young
men
devoid
of
any
stops
or
turnings
aside
to
watch
and
listen
willet
course
was
without
care
tayoga
opened
his
eyes
and
lazily
regarded
the
giant
figure
of
his
friend
now
in
full
view
robert
and
grosvenor
slept
on
i
am
glad
said
the
onondaga
it
was
significant
of
the
way
in
which
they
understood
each
other
and
the
way
they
could
read
the
signs
of
the
forest
that
they
could
talk
almost
without
words
so
am
i
said
the
hunter
but
i
had
hoped
for
it
since
it
is
so
we
need
not
awaken
them
just
yet
no
let
them
sleep
another
hour
tayoga
meant
that
he
was
glad
the
enemy
had
not
approached
and
willet
replied
that
he
had
hoped
for
such
good
luck
no
further
explanation
was
needed
you
had
the
heaviest
part
of
the
burden
to
carry
last
night
said
the
hunter
so
it
would
be
wise
for
you
to
join
them
if
you
can
in
the
hour
that
left
see
if
you
ca
follow
them
at
once
i
think
i
can
said
tayoga
at
least
i
will
try
in
five
minutes
he
too
had
gone
to
the
land
of
dreams
and
the
hunter
watched
alone
willet
although
weary
was
in
high
spirits
they
had
come
marvelously
through
many
perils
and
tayoga
achievement
in
rescuing
grosvenor
he
repeated
to
himself
was
well
nigh
miraculous
after
such
startling
luck
they
could
not
fail
and
an
omen
of
continued
good
fortune
was
the
fact
they
had
encountered
the
trail
of
black
rifle
he
would
be
a
powerful
addition
to
their
little
force
when
found
and
willet
did
not
doubt
that
they
would
overtake
him
the
only
problem
that
really
worried
him
now
was
that
of
food
small
as
was
their
army
of
four
it
had
to
be
provisioned
and
for
the
present
he
did
not
see
the
way
to
do
it
he
let
the
three
sleep
overtime
and
when
they
awoke
they
were
grateful
to
him
for
it
i
am
quite
made
over
said
grosvenor
and
i
think
that
if
i
stay
in
the
wilderness
long
enough
i
may
learn
to
be
a
scout
too
but
as
all
my
life
has
been
spent
in
quite
different
kinds
of
country
i
suppose
it
will
take
a
hundred
years
to
give
me
a
good
start
tayoga
smiled
not
a
hundred
years
he
said
red
coat
has
begun
very
well
and
now
with
a
lot
of
good
solid
food
i
feel
equal
to
any
march
continued
grosvenor
most
englishmen
you
know
eat
well
tayoga
looked
at
robert
who
looked
at
willet
who
in
his
turn
looked
at
the
onondaga
that
just
what
we
have
to
do
without
said
the
hunter
gravely
the
bottoms
of
our
knapsacks
are
looking
up
at
us
we
have
a
splendid
chance
to
see
how
long
we
can
do
without
food
one
needs
such
a
test
now
and
then
grosvenor
face
fell
but
his
was
the
true
mettle
in
an
instant
his
countenance
became
cheerful
again
i
not
hungry
he
exclaimed
it
was
the
delusion
of
a
moment
and
it
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
i
suffer
from
such
brief
spells
the
others
laughed
that
the
right
spirit
said
willet
and
while
we
have
nothing
to
eat
we
have
lots
of
hope
i
been
hungrier
than
this
often
and
as
you
see
i
never
starved
to
death
a
single
time
there
always
lots
of
food
somewhere
in
the
wilderness
if
you
only
know
how
to
put
your
hand
on
it
i
think
it
is
now
best
for
us
to
follow
on
the
trail
of
black
rifle
said
tayoga
that
so
responded
the
hunter
it
grown
a
lot
colder
while
you
lads
slept
though
i
think
you
can
follow
it
without
any
trouble
tayoga
the
red
lad
said
nothing
but
at
once
picked
up
the
traces
which
now
led
south
slanting
back
a
little
toward
the
lake
black
rifle
was
going
fast
he
said
his
stride
lengthens
he
must
have
divined
where
luc
with
his
force
lay
and
he
took
a
direct
course
for
it
ah
he
turns
suddenly
aside
and
walks
to
and
fro
that
curious
said
the
hunter
i
see
the
footprints
all
about
what
did
black
rifle
mean
by
moving
about
in
such
a
manner
it
is
not
odd
at
all
said
tayoga
doubtless
black
rifle
was
suffering
from
the
same
lack
that
we
are
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
provision
his
army
of
one
at
once
he
suddenly
saw
a
chance
to
do
so
and
he
turned
aside
from
his
direct
journey
toward
the
south
so
we
shall
soon
see
where
black
rifle
shot
his
bear
and
why
not
a
deer
said
grosvenor
because
his
trail
now
leads
toward
that
deep
thicket
on
our
right
a
thicket
made
up
of
bushes
and
vines
and
briars
a
deer
could
not
have
gone
into
it
but
a
bear
could
and
we
know
now
it
was
a
bear
because
here
are
its
tracks
black
rifle
killed
the
bear
in
the
thicket
are
you
sure
of
that
tayoga
asked
robert
absolutely
sure
dagaeoga
it
is
in
this
case
a
matter
of
mind
and
not
of
eye
black
rifle
is
too
good
a
hunter
to
fire
a
useless
shot
and
too
experienced
to
miss
his
game
when
he
needs
it
so
badly
he
would
take
every
precaution
for
success
my
mind
tells
me
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
miss
and
he
did
miss
said
robert
as
they
entered
the
thicket
see
where
the
vines
and
briars
were
threshed
about
by
the
bear
as
he
fell
here
are
spots
of
blood
and
here
goes
the
path
along
which
he
dragged
the
body
all
this
is
as
plain
as
day
it
was
a
fat
bear
too
said
tayoga
although
it
is
early
spring
he
had
found
so
many
good
roots
and
berries
that
he
had
more
than
made
up
for
the
loss
of
weight
in
his
long
winter
fast
we
will
soon
find
where
black
rifle
cleaned
his
prize
a
bear
is
too
heavy
to
carry
far
ah
he
did
his
work
just
beyond
us
in
the
little
valley
how
do
you
know
that
asked
grosvenor
we
ca
yet
see
into
the
valley
the
great
red
trailer
smiled
this
time
o
red
coat
he
replied
it
is
a
combination
of
mind
and
eye
mind
tells
me
that
black
rifle
could
not
clean
and
dress
his
bear
unless
he
got
it
to
water
mind
tells
me
that
a
brook
is
flowing
in
the
valley
just
ahead
of
us
because
there
is
scarcely
a
valley
in
the
country
that
does
not
have
its
brook
eye
tells
me
that
black
rifle
finished
his
task
by
the
great
oak
there
do
you
not
see
the
huge
buzzards
flying
above
the
tree
they
are
conclusive
ah
the
forest
people
gathered
fast
in
numbers
they
expected
that
black
rifle
would
leave
them
a
great
feast
they
found
a
little
brook
of
clear
cold
water
and
beside
it
the
place
where
black
rifle
had
cleaned
his
bear
reserving
afterward
the
choice
portion
for
himself
when
he
went
on
said
tayoga
the
forest
people
made
a
rush
for
what
he
did
not
want
which
was
much
great
birds
came
we
can
not
see
their
trail
through
the
air
but
we
can
see
where
they
hopped
about
here
on
the
ground
tore
at
the
flesh
and
fought
with
one
another
for
the
spoil
a
lynx
came
and
then
another
and
then
wolves
the
weasel
and
the
mink
too
hung
on
the
outskirts
waiting
for
what
the
bigger
animals
might
leave
among
them
they
left
nothing
and
they
were
not
long
in
the
task
only
shining
bones
lay
on
the
ground
they
had
been
picked
clean
and
all
the
forest
people
had
gone
after
their
brief
banquet
the
trails
led
away
in
different
directions
but
that
of
black
rifle
went
on
toward
the
south
the
traces
however
were
more
distinct
than
they
had
been
before
he
stopped
for
the
bear
it
is
because
he
is
carrying
much
weight
said
tayoga
black
rifle
no
longer
skips
along
like
a
youth
as
red
coat
here
does
you
can
have
all
the
sport
with
me
you
wish
said
grosvenor
i
do
forget
that
you
saved
my
life
when
by
all
the
rules
of
logic
it
was
lost
beyond
the
hope
of
recovery
black
rifle
would
not
eat
so
much
bear
meat
himself
said
tayoga
nor
would
he
carry
such
a
burden
without
good
cause
it
may
be
that
he
expects
us
he
has
perhaps
heard
that
we
are
in
this
region
it
possible
said
the
hunter
full
of
eagerness
they
pressed
forward
on
the
trail
chapter
vi
black
rifle
they
had
been
following
the
trail
about
half
an
hour
when
tayoga
noticed
that
it
was
growing
deeper
ah
he
said
black
rifle
now
walks
much
more
slowly
so
slow
that
he
barely
creeps
and
his
feet
press
down
harder
i
think
he
is
going
to
make
another
stop
maybe
he
intends
to
cook
a
part
of
that
fat
bear
said
grosvenor
struggling
hard
though
to
keep
all
trace
of
envy
out
of
his
voice
you
said
a
while
back
that
he
was
going
to
kill
the
bear
because
he
was
hungry
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
be
a
very
foolish
man
if
having
got
his
bear
he
did
make
use
of
any
portion
of
it
tayoga
laughed
with
sincere
enjoyment
red
coat
reasons
well
he
said
if
a
man
is
eager
to
eat
and
he
has
that
which
he
can
eat
then
he
would
be
a
silly
man
if
he
did
not
eat
red
coat
has
all
the
makings
of
a
trailer
in
a
few
more
yards
black
rifle
will
stop
and
cook
himself
a
splendid
dinner
here
he
put
his
bear
meat
upon
this
log
the
red
stains
show
it
then
he
picked
up
dead
and
fallen
wood
and
broke
it
into
the
right
length
over
the
log
you
can
see
where
he
broke
places
in
the
bark
at
the
same
time
then
he
heaped
them
all
in
the
little
hollow
where
he
has
left
the
pile
of
ashes
but
before
he
lighted
a
fire
with
his
flint
and
steel
he
made
a
wide
circle
all
about
to
see
if
any
enemy
might
be
near
we
knew
he
would
do
that
because
black
rifle
is
a
very
cautious
man
but
his
trail
proves
it
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
look
then
satisfied
he
came
back
and
started
the
flame
but
he
kept
the
blaze
very
low
lest
a
prowling
foe
see
it
when
the
bed
of
coals
was
fanned
he
cooked
large
portions
of
the
bear
and
ate
because
black
rifle
was
hungry
ah
so
hungry
and
the
bear
was
very
savory
and
pleasing
to
his
palate
stop
tayoga
stop
exclaimed
grosvenor
i
ca
stand
such
torture
you
make
me
starve
to
death
where
i
stand
but
as
you
are
about
to
become
a
warrior
of
the
woods
red
coat
said
the
onondaga
gravely
you
must
learn
to
endure
among
us
a
warrior
will
purposely
put
the
fire
to
his
hand
or
his
breast
and
hold
it
there
until
the
flesh
smokes
nor
will
he
utter
a
groan
or
even
wince
and
all
his
people
will
applaud
him
and
call
him
brave
grosvenor
shuddered
he
did
not
see
the
lurking
gleam
of
humor
in
the
eye
of
tayoga
i
do
need
to
pretend
for
the
sake
of
practice
that
i
am
starving
he
said
i
starving
in
fact
and
i
do
it
without
the
need
of
applause
but
black
rifle
was
enjoying
himself
greatly
continued
the
onondaga
and
we
can
rejoice
in
the
joys
of
a
friend
if
we
have
not
a
thing
ourselves
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
somebody
else
had
it
he
used
his
opportunities
to
the
utmost
here
are
more
bones
which
he
threw
away
with
shreds
of
flesh
yet
on
them
and
which
the
forest
people
came
to
pick
clean
lo
their
tracks
are
everywhere
about
black
rifle
little
camp
one
of
them
became
so
persistent
and
bold
a
wolf
it
was
that
black
rifle
not
willing
to
shoot
seized
a
large
stone
and
threw
it
at
him
with
great
violence
there
lies
the
stone
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
as
there
is
fresh
earth
on
its
under
surface
it
was
partly
imbedded
in
the
ground
where
black
rifle
snatched
it
up
there
just
beyond
your
right
foot
red
coat
is
a
little
depression
the
place
in
the
earth
from
which
he
tore
it
black
rifle
aim
was
good
too
he
struck
the
wolf
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
there
are
red
stains
where
several
drops
of
blood
fell
the
wolf
was
full
of
mortification
pain
and
anger
when
he
ran
away
he
would
never
have
been
so
bold
and
venturesome
if
his
hunger
had
not
made
him
forget
his
prudence
he
was
as
hungry
as
you
are
this
minute
red
coat
i
suppose
you
are
giving
me
preliminary
practice
in
torture
tayoga
well
go
on
with
it
old
fellow
i
try
to
stand
it
no
that
is
enough
as
a
beginning
we
will
follow
the
trail
of
black
rifle
again
after
he
had
eaten
so
well
he
was
so
much
refreshed
that
he
will
start
again
with
a
vigorous
and
strong
step
lo
it
is
as
i
said
he
is
taking
a
long
stride
but
i
do
not
think
he
is
walking
fast
his
pace
is
very
slow
it
may
be
that
there
is
something
in
what
dagaeoga
says
it
is
possible
that
black
rifle
is
waiting
for
those
who
will
not
be
unwelcome
to
him
robert
was
quite
able
to
fathom
what
was
passing
in
the
brain
of
the
onondaga
he
saw
that
the
trail
was
growing
quite
fresh
and
his
spirits
became
buoyant
and
red
coat
is
hungry
said
tayoga
that
lurking
gleam
of
humor
in
his
eye
growing
larger
let
him
remember
that
however
he
may
suffer
from
lack
of
food
he
can
suffer
yet
more
it
is
wonderful
what
the
body
can
endure
and
yet
live
here
black
rifle
stopped
and
rested
on
these
stones
perhaps
an
hour
no
red
coat
there
are
no
signs
to
show
it
but
the
trail
on
the
other
side
is
much
fresher
which
proves
it
it
is
quite
clear
now
that
black
rifle
is
waiting
he
is
not
running
away
from
anybody
or
anything
ah
red
coat
if
we
only
had
some
of
his
precious
bear
steaks
how
welcome
to
us
they
would
be
go
on
tayoga
as
i
told
you
i
try
to
stand
it
that
is
well
red
coat
but
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
wish
for
black
rifle
bear
steaks
we
will
have
a
portion
of
them
ourselves
now
tayoga
your
talk
sounds
a
little
wild
to
me
but
listen
red
coat
the
onondaga
suddenly
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
shrill
whistle
that
penetrated
far
in
the
forest
in
a
few
instants
the
answer
another
whistle
came
back
from
a
point
a
few
hundred
yards
ahead
and
tayoga
said
quietly
red
coat
black
rifle
is
waiting
for
us
we
will
now
go
forward
and
he
will
give
us
our
dinner
they
advanced
without
hesitation
and
the
figure
of
the
dark
hunter
rose
up
to
meet
them
his
face
showed
pleasure
as
he
extended
his
hand
first
to
willet
dave
old
comrade
he
said
the
sight
of
you
in
the
forest
is
always
a
pleasure
to
the
eye
i
thought
you
be
coming
with
the
lads
and
i
been
making
ready
for
you
i
knew
that
tayoga
the
greatest
trailer
the
world
has
ever
known
would
be
sure
to
strike
my
traces
and
that
he
read
them
like
print
and
here
robert
too
a
fine
boy
if
i
do
say
it
to
his
face
and
lieutenant
grosvenor
you
may
know
me
lieutenant
though
i
recall
you
and
i
can
tell
you
you
mighty
lucky
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
these
three
i
think
so
too
said
grosvenor
earnestly
red
coat
is
happy
to
see
you
said
tayoga
but
he
will
be
happier
to
see
your
bear
the
lieutenant
is
hungry
said
black
rifle
then
come
there
is
enough
for
all
what
made
you
wait
for
us
asked
robert
you
know
how
i
roam
the
woods
doing
as
i
please
and
under
command
i
found
that
tandakora
was
by
the
lake
with
warriors
and
that
luc
was
not
far
away
tandakora
men
seemed
to
be
trailing
somebody
and
hiding
in
the
bushes
i
spied
on
them
i
was
near
enough
to
hear
two
warriors
talking
and
i
learned
that
it
was
you
they
were
following
then
coming
on
ahead
i
left
a
trail
for
you
to
see
and
i
got
plenty
of
bear
steaks
already
cooked
for
you
god
bless
you
black
rifle
said
grosvenor
fervently
amen
said
robert
black
rifle
showed
them
his
lair
among
dense
bushes
and
after
they
had
satisfied
their
hunger
the
bear
divided
in
equal
portions
among
all
was
stored
away
in
their
knapsacks
grosvenor
luckily
having
retained
his
own
as
the
indians
had
not
deprived
him
of
it
they
now
had
food
enough
for
several
days
and
one
great
source
of
anxiety
was
removed
what
had
you
found
black
rifle
asked
willet
luc
has
a
big
force
he
throwing
a
sort
of
veil
before
montcalm
while
the
marquis
fortifies
to
meet
the
attack
of
the
british
and
americans
that
all
know
is
coming
perhaps
the
lieutenant
can
tell
us
most
about
that
force
it
to
be
a
great
one
said
grosvenor
and
we
go
through
to
quebec
said
robert
his
eyes
flashing
his
imagination
at
once
alive
we
put
out
forever
the
fire
always
burning
in
the
north
and
give
our
border
peace
easy
lads
easy
said
willet
a
thing
never
done
until
done
i
feel
pretty
sure
we
do
it
but
we
reckon
with
present
difficulties
first
it
seems
to
me
it
our
duty
now
to
follow
luc
and
see
what
he
means
to
do
with
his
force
it
hard
on
you
lieutenant
because
you
have
to
stay
with
us
you
ca
go
back
to
albany
just
yet
grosvenor
glanced
around
at
the
unbroken
forest
i
resigned
he
said
after
that
wonderful
escape
i
ready
for
anything
i
see
that
this
is
my
great
chance
to
become
a
scout
and
i
do
the
best
i
can
i
take
it
said
black
rifle
that
the
main
object
of
luc
is
to
clear
the
forest
of
all
our
scouts
and
skirmishers
in
order
that
we
may
be
kept
in
complete
ignorance
of
montcalm
movements
we
show
him
that
he
ca
do
it
you
have
not
forgotten
any
of
your
skill
have
you
tayoga
so
far
from
forgetting
any
of
it
he
acquired
more
said
willet
answering
for
the
onondaga
when
it
comes
to
trailing
that
boy
just
breathes
it
in
he
adds
some
new
tricks
every
day
but
i
think
better
lie
by
the
rest
of
and
do
you
black
rifle
we
do
want
to
wear
out
our
lads
at
the
start
well
spoken
dave
responded
black
rifle
it
a
camp
in
the
enemy
country
we
have
to
make
with
the
warriors
all
about
us
but
we
must
take
the
risk
we
better
go
to
the
next
brook
and
walk
up
it
a
long
distance
it
the
oldest
of
all
tricks
to
hide
your
trail
but
it
is
still
the
best
they
found
the
brook
only
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
on
and
extended
their
walk
along
its
pebbly
bed
fully
a
mile
and
a
half
as
a
precaution
keeping
to
their
wading
until
they
could
emerge
on
rocky
ground
where
they
left
no
trail
it
will
be
only
chance
now
that
will
bring
them
down
on
us
said
willet
do
you
think
lieutenant
that
after
such
a
long
walk
you
could
manage
another
bear
steak
if
the
company
will
join
me
replied
grosvenor
i
do
wish
to
show
bad
manners
i
join
you
said
willet
speaking
for
the
others
and
i
think
we
make
a
brief
camp
on
that
wooded
hill
there
why
on
a
hill
willet
why
not
in
a
hollow
where
it
seems
to
me
we
would
be
better
hidden
because
besides
hiding
ourselves
we
want
to
see
and
you
can
see
better
from
a
height
than
from
a
valley
in
the
bushes
there
have
a
view
all
about
us
and
i
do
think
our
enemies
can
come
too
near
unseen
by
us
when
we
get
into
the
thicket
on
the
hill
lieutenant
you
can
resume
that
pleasant
nap
that
you
did
not
finish
eight
or
ten
hours
more
of
sleep
will
be
just
the
thing
for
you
all
of
you
sleep
a
while
said
black
rifle
i
guard
i
fresh
but
be
sure
you
walk
on
the
stones
we
must
leave
no
trace
they
found
a
fairly
comfortable
place
in
the
thicket
and
soon
all
were
asleep
except
black
rifle
who
sat
with
his
rifle
between
his
knees
and
from
his
covert
scanned
the
forest
on
all
sides
black
rifle
felt
satisfaction
he
was
pleased
to
be
with
the
friends
for
whom
he
cared
most
an
historical
figure
solitary
aloof
he
was
a
vivid
personality
yet
scarcely
anything
was
known
about
him
his
right
name
even
had
disappeared
and
to
the
border
far
and
near
he
was
just
black
rifle
or
black
jack
a
great
scout
and
a
terror
to
the
indians
in
his
way
he
was
fond
of
willet
tayoga
and
young
lennox
and
he
felt
also
that
he
would
like
grosvenor
when
he
knew
him
better
so
while
they
slept
he
watched
with
a
vigilance
that
nobody
save
tayoga
could
surpass
black
rifle
saw
the
life
of
the
forest
go
on
undisturbed
the
birds
on
the
boughs
went
about
their
business
and
the
little
animals
worked
or
played
as
usual
in
the
bushes
everything
said
to
him
that
no
enemy
was
near
and
his
own
five
senses
confirmed
it
the
afternoon
passed
and
about
twilight
tayoga
awoke
but
the
others
slept
on
sleep
now
black
rifle
said
the
onondaga
i
will
take
up
the
watch
i
do
feel
like
closing
my
eyes
just
yet
tayoga
replied
the
scout
and
i
sit
a
while
with
you
nothing
has
happened
tandakora
has
not
been
able
to
find
our
trail
but
he
will
hunt
long
for
it
black
rifle
when
my
race
hates
it
hates
well
tandakora
feels
his
grudge
against
us
he
has
tried
to
do
us
much
harm
and
he
is
grieved
because
we
have
not
fallen
before
him
he
blames
us
for
it
i
know
he
does
did
you
hear
something
walking
in
the
thicket
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
it
is
only
a
bear
perhaps
he
is
looking
for
a
good
place
in
which
to
pass
the
night
but
he
will
go
much
farther
away
why
tayoga
because
the
wind
is
shifting
about
a
little
and
in
another
minute
it
will
take
him
a
whiff
of
the
human
odor
then
he
will
run
away
and
run
fast
now
he
is
running
i
do
hear
him
tayoga
but
i
take
it
that
you
know
what
you
are
saying
is
true
my
ears
are
uncommonly
keen
black
rifle
it
is
no
merit
of
mine
that
they
are
so
why
should
a
man
talk
about
a
gift
from
manitou
when
it
really
is
the
work
of
manitou
ah
the
bear
is
going
toward
the
south
and
he
is
well
frightened
because
he
never
stops
to
look
back
nor
does
he
hesitate
now
he
is
gone
and
he
will
not
come
back
again
black
rifle
glanced
at
the
onondaga
in
the
dusk
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
admiration
you
have
wonderful
gifts
tayoga
he
said
i
do
believe
such
eyes
and
ears
as
yours
are
to
be
found
in
the
head
of
any
other
man
but
as
i
have
just
told
you
black
rifle
however
good
they
may
be
the
credit
belongs
to
manitou
and
not
to
me
i
am
but
a
poor
instrument
still
you
find
useful
and
the
exercise
of
such
powers
must
yield
a
certain
pleasure
they
particularly
valuable
just
now
as
thinking
we
have
an
eventful
night
i
think
so
too
black
rifle
with
the
warriors
and
the
french
so
near
us
it
is
not
likely
that
it
could
pass
in
peace
at
any
rate
dave
and
the
lads
are
not
worrying
about
it
i
never
saw
anybody
sleep
more
soundly
i
reckon
they
were
pretty
well
worn
out
so
they
were
and
unless
danger
comes
very
close
we
will
not
awaken
them
that
it
will
be
near
us
soon
i
do
not
doubt
because
tododaho
warns
me
that
peril
is
at
hand
he
was
looking
up
at
the
star
on
which
his
patron
saint
sat
and
his
face
had
that
rapt
expression
which
it
always
wore
when
his
spirit
leaped
into
the
void
to
meet
that
of
the
great
onondaga
chief
who
had
gone
away
four
hundred
years
ago
black
rifle
regarded
him
with
respect
he
too
was
steeped
in
indian
lore
and
belief
and
if
tayoga
said
he
saw
and
heard
what
others
could
not
hear
or
see
then
he
saw
and
heard
them
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
what
do
you
see
tayoga
he
asked
tododaho
sits
on
his
star
with
the
wise
snakes
coil
on
coil
in
his
hair
and
the
great
mohawk
hayowentha
who
is
inferior
only
to
tododaho
speaks
to
him
from
his
own
star
across
infinite
space
they
are
talking
of
us
but
it
comes
only
as
a
whisper
like
the
dying
voice
of
a
distant
wind
and
i
can
not
understand
their
words
but
both
the
great
warriors
look
down
warningly
at
us
they
tell
us
to
beware
that
we
are
threatened
by
a
great
peril
i
can
read
their
faces
but
a
mist
is
passing
in
the
heavens
the
star
of
the
mohawk
fades
lo
it
is
gone
and
now
the
vapors
gather
before
the
face
of
tododaho
too
lo
he
also
has
gone
and
there
are
only
clouds
and
mists
in
the
far
heavens
but
the
great
chiefs
from
their
stars
have
told
us
to
watch
and
to
watch
well
i
believe
you
i
believe
every
word
you
say
tayoga
exclaimed
black
rifle
in
a
tone
of
awe
the
mist
is
coming
down
here
too
i
think
it
floating
in
from
the
lake
it
will
be
all
over
the
thickets
soon
i
reckon
that
the
danger
threatening
us
is
from
the
warriors
and
if
we
are
in
a
veil
of
fog
we
have
to
rely
on
our
ears
i
not
bragging
when
i
say
that
mine
are
pretty
good
but
yours
are
better
tayoga
did
not
reply
he
knew
that
the
compliment
was
true
but
as
before
he
ascribed
the
credit
to
manitou
because
he
had
made
the
gift
and
not
to
himself
who
was
merely
an
involuntary
agent
the
mist
and
vapors
were
increasing
drifting
toward
them
in
clouds
from
the
lake
a
vanguard
of
shreds
and
patches
already
floating
over
the
bushes
in
which
they
lay
it
was
evident
that
soon
they
would
not
be
able
to
see
five
yards
from
there
in
ten
minutes
the
mist
became
a
fog
white
and
thick
the
sleeping
three
were
almost
hidden
although
they
were
at
the
feet
of
the
watchers
and
the
two
saw
each
other
but
dimly
they
seemed
to
be
in
a
tiny
island
with
a
white
ocean
circling
about
them
the
onondaga
lay
flat
and
put
his
ear
to
the
earth
what
do
you
hear
tayoga
whispered
the
scout
nothing
yet
black
rifle
but
the
usual
whispers
of
the
wilderness
a
little
wind
among
the
trees
and
a
distant
and
uneasy
deer
walking
why
should
a
deer
be
walking
about
at
this
time
and
why
should
he
be
uneasy
tayoga
any
deer
in
his
right
mind
ought
to
be
taking
his
rest
now
in
the
forest
that
is
true
black
rifle
but
this
deer
is
worried
and
when
a
deer
is
worried
there
is
a
cause
a
deer
is
not
like
a
man
full
of
fancies
and
creating
danger
when
danger
there
is
none
he
is
troubled
because
there
are
strange
presences
in
the
woods
presences
that
he
dreads
maybe
he
scents
us
no
the
wind
does
not
blow
from
us
toward
him
do
not
move
do
not
stir
in
the
least
black
rifle
i
think
i
catch
another
sound
almost
as
light
as
that
made
by
a
leaf
when
it
falls
ah
manitou
is
good
to
me
he
makes
me
hear
better
than
i
ever
heard
before
because
it
is
his
purpose
i
know
not
why
to
make
me
do
so
there
comes
the
little
sound
again
and
it
is
real
it
was
a
footstep
far
away
and
then
another
and
another
and
now
many
it
is
the
tread
of
marching
men
and
they
are
white
men
how
do
you
know
they
are
white
men
tayoga
mingled
with
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
is
a
little
clank
made
by
the
hilts
of
swords
and
the
butts
of
pistols
striking
against
the
metal
on
their
belts
there
is
a
slight
creaking
of
leather
too
which
could
not
possibly
come
from
a
band
of
warriors
i
hear
the
echo
of
a
voice
i
think
it
is
a
command
a
short
sharp
word
or
two
such
as
white
officers
give
the
sounds
of
the
footsteps
merge
now
black
rifle
because
the
men
are
marching
to
the
same
step
i
think
there
must
be
at
least
fifty
of
them
they
are
sure
to
be
french
because
we
are
certain
our
troops
are
not
yet
in
this
region
and
because
only
the
french
are
so
active
that
they
make
these
swift
marches
at
night
unfortunately
that
so
tayoga
will
they
pass
near
us
very
near
us
but
i
do
not
think
they
will
see
us
as
the
fog
is
so
thick
should
we
wake
the
others
and
move
no
at
least
not
yet
now
they
are
going
very
slowly
it
is
not
because
they
do
not
know
the
way
but
because
the
fog
troubles
them
it
is
luc
who
leads
them
i
do
see
how
your
ear
can
tell
you
that
tayoga
it
is
not
my
ear
it
is
my
mind
that
tells
me
black
rifle
the
french
would
not
go
through
the
forest
unless
they
had
warriors
with
them
as
guides
flankers
and
skirmishers
only
luc
could
make
them
come
because
we
know
that
even
the
french
have
great
trouble
in
inducing
them
to
enter
big
battles
they
like
better
ambush
and
foray
de
courcelles
could
not
make
them
march
on
this
journey
nor
could
jumonville
my
reason
tells
me
it
could
be
only
luc
it
must
be
yes
i
sure
now
it
luc
up
to
some
trick
that
we
ought
to
meet
but
we
do
not
know
what
the
trick
is
black
rifle
ah
they
have
stopped
all
of
them
have
stopped
it
is
not
possible
that
they
have
seen
any
traces
of
us
tayoga
we
left
no
trail
besides
this
fog
is
so
thick
and
heavy
it
like
a
blanket
hiding
everything
no
it
is
not
that
we
left
no
trail
they
are
so
near
that
we
could
see
them
if
there
were
no
fog
now
i
hear
some
one
walking
alone
in
front
of
the
company
his
step
is
quick
sharp
and
positive
it
is
luc
because
being
the
leader
he
is
the
only
one
who
would
walk
that
way
at
such
a
time
i
think
he
wants
to
see
for
himself
or
rather
feel
just
where
they
are
now
he
too
stops
and
some
one
walks
forward
to
join
him
it
is
a
frenchman
because
he
has
on
boots
i
can
hear
just
the
faintest
creak
of
the
leather
it
must
be
de
courcelles
it
may
be
his
comrade
jumonville
no
it
is
de
courcelles
because
he
is
tall
while
jumonville
is
not
and
the
stride
of
this
man
who
is
going
forward
to
join
luc
is
long
it
is
surely
de
courcelles
luc
does
not
like
him
but
he
has
to
use
him
because
the
frenchmen
are
not
many
and
a
leader
can
only
lead
those
who
are
at
hand
to
be
led
now
they
talk
together
perhaps
they
are
puzzled
about
the
direction
well
so
would
i
be
if
i
had
to
go
anywhere
in
such
a
fog
they
walk
back
together
to
the
soldiers
and
now
there
is
no
noise
of
footsteps
i
take
it
that
they
waiting
for
something
aye
black
rifle
they
are
waiting
in
the
hope
that
the
fog
will
rise
you
know
how
suddenly
a
fog
can
lift
and
leave
everything
bright
and
clear
and
they
would
see
us
at
once
they
be
fairly
on
top
of
us
so
they
would
be
if
the
fog
should
go
quickly
away
and
do
you
think
it
will
asked
black
rifle
in
alarm
tayoga
laughed
under
his
breath
i
do
not
he
replied
confidently
there
is
no
wind
to
take
it
away
the
great
bank
of
mist
and
vapor
will
be
heavy
upon
the
ground
and
will
increase
in
thickness
it
would
not
be
wise
for
us
to
move
because
there
may
be
ears
among
them
as
keen
as
ours
and
they
might
hear
us
then
blinded
by
the
fog
we
might
walk
directly
into
the
hands
of
prowling
warriors
although
we
are
not
many
yards
from
them
we
are
safest
where
we
are
motionless
and
still
black
rifle
also
lay
down
and
put
his
ear
to
the
earth
i
hear
very
well
myself
although
not
as
well
as
you
tayoga
he
whispered
and
i
want
to
notice
what
they
doing
as
far
as
i
can
i
make
out
the
sound
of
a
lot
of
footsteps
but
i
ca
tell
what
they
mean
they
are
sending
groups
in
different
directions
black
rifle
looking
for
a
way
through
the
forest
rather
than
for
us
they
are
still
uncertain
where
they
are
five
or
six
men
are
going
southward
about
as
many
have
turned
toward
the
west
and
two
warriors
and
a
frenchman
are
coming
toward
us
the
rest
stay
where
they
are
it
the
three
coming
in
our
direction
who
are
bothering
me
but
remember
black
rifle
that
we
are
hidden
in
the
deep
fog
as
a
fish
is
hidden
in
the
water
and
it
will
be
almost
as
hard
to
find
us
they
must
step
nearly
upon
us
before
they
could
see
us
black
rifle
in
his
eventful
life
upon
the
border
had
passed
through
many
a
crisis
but
never
any
that
tested
his
nerves
more
thoroughly
than
the
one
he
now
faced
he
too
heard
the
steps
of
the
three
warriors
coming
in
their
direction
cautiously
feeling
a
way
through
the
great
bank
of
mist
it
was
true
that
they
could
pass
near
without
seeing
but
chance
might
bring
them
straight
to
the
little
group
he
shifted
his
fingers
to
the
lock
and
trigger
of
his
rifle
and
looked
at
the
sleeping
three
whose
figures
were
almost
hidden
although
they
were
not
a
yard
away
he
felt
that
they
should
be
awake
and
ready
but
in
waking
grosvenor
at
least
might
make
enough
noise
to
draw
the
warriors
upon
them
at
once
they
have
shifted
their
course
a
little
whispered
tayoga
and
it
leads
to
our
right
now
they
change
back
again
and
now
they
keep
turning
toward
the
left
i
think
they
will
pass
eight
or
ten
yards
from
us
which
will
be
as
good
as
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
the
white
man
slowly
raised
his
rifle
but
did
not
cock
it
that
action
would
have
made
a
clicking
sound
sharp
and
clear
in
the
fog
but
the
quick
hands
were
ready
for
instant
use
he
knew
as
tayoga
had
said
that
the
chance
of
the
warriors
walking
upon
them
in
the
blinding
fog
was
small
but
if
the
chance
came
it
would
have
to
be
met
with
all
their
power
and
resource
i
think
they
will
come
within
about
ten
feet
of
us
continued
tayoga
in
his
soft
whisper
there
are
two
tall
warriors
and
one
quite
short
the
tall
ones
take
about
three
steps
to
the
short
four
and
even
then
the
short
man
is
always
behind
they
do
not
walk
in
single
file
as
usual
but
spread
out
that
they
may
cover
as
much
ground
as
possible
now
they
are
coming
very
near
and
i
think
it
best
black
rifle
that
i
talk
no
more
for
the
present
but
i
will
hold
my
rifle
ready
as
you
are
doing
if
unlucky
chance
should
bring
them
upon
us
the
footsteps
approached
and
passed
a
little
to
the
left
but
came
so
near
that
black
rifle
almost
fancied
he
could
see
the
dim
figures
in
the
fog
when
they
went
on
he
drew
a
mighty
breath
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
we
fairly
grazed
the
edge
of
death
he
whispered
i
sit
up
now
and
you
can
do
the
rest
of
the
listening
all
by
yourself
tayoga
the
three
have
rejoined
the
main
body
said
the
onondaga
and
the
other
parties
that
went
out
have
also
gone
back
i
think
the
one
that
went
south
probably
found
the
way
in
which
they
wanted
to
go
and
they
will
now
move
on
leaving
us
safe
for
the
while
yes
i
can
hear
them
marching
and
the
clank
of
the
french
weapons
and
equipment
he
listened
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
announced
that
they
were
quite
beyond
hearing
they
are
gone
he
said
and
great
bear
dagaeoga
and
red
coat
have
not
even
known
that
they
were
here
in
which
they
were
lucky
said
black
rifle
the
scout
awoke
the
three
who
were
much
astonished
to
learn
that
such
danger
had
passed
so
near
them
then
they
considered
what
was
best
for
them
to
do
next
chapter
vii
the
forest
battle
it
is
quite
evident
said
robert
as
they
talked
that
we
must
follow
on
the
trail
of
luc
we
settled
in
our
minds
that
he
wants
to
keep
our
people
busy
along
lake
george
while
montcalm
fortifies
higher
up
then
it
our
duty
to
find
out
what
he
doing
and
stop
it
if
we
can
all
were
in
agreement
upon
the
point
even
grosvenor
who
did
not
yet
feel
at
home
in
the
woods
but
we
must
wait
until
the
fog
lifts
said
willet
if
we
moved
now
we
might
walk
directly
into
the
arms
of
the
enemy
and
we
can
afford
to
wait
the
night
through
anyhow
tayoga
we
have
got
to
keep
you
fresh
because
your
senses
and
faculties
must
be
at
their
finest
and
most
delicate
pitch
for
trailing
so
now
you
go
to
sleep
all
the
rest
of
you
do
the
same
and
i
watch
soon
four
slumbered
and
only
the
hunter
was
awake
and
on
guard
but
he
was
enough
his
sight
and
hearing
were
almost
as
good
as
those
of
tayoga
himself
and
he
too
began
to
believe
that
the
onondaga
manitou
was
a
shield
before
them
danger
had
come
often
and
very
near
but
it
had
always
passed
and
for
the
present
at
least
he
was
not
apprehensive
the
fog
might
hang
on
all
night
if
it
chose
they
could
easily
make
up
lost
ground
in
the
morning
meanwhile
they
were
accumulating
fresh
strength
the
four
were
sleeping
very
placidly
and
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
awake
before
dawn
willet
looked
at
their
relaxed
figures
with
genuine
benevolence
there
were
the
friends
for
whom
he
cared
most
and
he
felt
sure
the
young
englishman
also
would
become
an
addition
grosvenor
was
full
of
courage
and
he
had
already
proved
that
he
was
adaptable
he
would
learn
fast
the
hunter
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
situation
the
fog
did
not
go
away
instead
it
thickened
perceptibly
rolling
up
in
new
waves
from
the
lake
the
figures
of
the
sleeping
four
were
wrapped
in
it
as
in
a
white
blanket
but
willet
knew
they
were
there
no
air
stirred
and
as
he
sat
silent
he
listened
for
sounds
that
might
come
through
the
white
veil
hearing
only
the
occasional
stirring
of
some
animal
toward
morning
the
inevitable
change
occurred
a
wind
arose
in
the
south
gentle
puffs
in
the
beginning
then
blowing
steady
and
strong
the
fog
was
torn
away
first
at
the
top
where
it
was
thinnest
floating
off
in
shreds
and
patches
and
then
the
whole
wall
of
it
yielded
before
the
insistent
breeze
driven
toward
the
north
like
a
mist
and
leaving
the
woods
and
thickets
free
willet
made
a
careful
circle
about
the
camp
at
a
range
of
several
hundred
yards
and
found
no
sign
of
hostile
presence
then
he
resumed
his
silent
vigil
and
an
hour
later
the
sun
rose
in
a
shower
of
gold
tayoga
opened
his
eyes
and
willet
awakened
the
others
the
fog
is
gone
said
the
hunter
and
eyes
are
useful
once
more
i
been
around
the
camp
and
there
is
no
immediate
threat
hanging
over
us
we
can
enjoy
a
good
breakfast
on
black
rifle
cold
bear
and
then
we
start
on
luc
trail
the
path
of
the
force
that
had
marched
past
in
the
night
was
quite
plain
even
grosvenor
with
his
inexperience
could
tell
that
many
men
had
walked
there
most
of
the
frenchmen
as
well
as
the
indians
had
worn
moccasins
but
the
imprints
made
by
the
boot
heels
of
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
were
clearly
visible
among
the
fainter
traces
how
many
men
would
you
say
were
in
this
force
tayoga
asked
willet
about
fifty
frenchmen
and
maybe
as
many
warriors
replied
the
onondaga
the
frenchmen
stay
together
but
the
warriors
leave
now
and
then
in
little
parties
and
the
trail
also
shows
where
some
of
the
parties
came
back
see
red
coat
here
is
where
two
warriors
returned
the
french
stay
with
luc
not
because
they
are
not
good
scouts
and
trailers
but
because
the
division
of
the
work
now
allots
this
task
to
the
indians
you
right
when
you
call
the
french
good
scouts
and
trailers
said
willet
they
seem
to
take
naturally
to
forest
life
and
i
know
the
indians
like
them
better
than
they
do
any
other
white
people
as
i
often
tell
robert
here
the
french
are
enemies
of
whom
anybody
can
be
proud
there
is
a
braver
race
in
the
world
i
do
underrate
said
grosvenor
it
wo
be
long
until
we
reach
their
camp
said
tayoga
sharp
sword
is
too
great
a
leader
to
have
carried
his
men
very
far
in
a
blind
fog
i
do
not
think
he
went
on
more
than
a
mile
it
is
likely
that
he
stopped
at
the
first
brook
and
the
slope
of
the
ground
shows
that
we
will
come
soon
to
a
stream
more
of
the
scouts
that
he
sent
out
are
returning
to
the
main
trail
they
could
not
have
gone
far
in
the
fog
and
of
course
they
found
nothing
we
have
then
to
beware
lest
we
run
into
their
camp
before
they
left
it
said
willet
i
do
think
sharp
sword
would
stay
there
after
dawn
continued
the
onondaga
the
fact
that
he
marched
at
night
in
the
fog
shows
that
he
is
eager
to
get
on
and
i
am
quite
sure
we
will
find
a
cold
camp
here
go
the
footsteps
of
luc
i
know
they
are
his
because
his
foot
is
small
and
he
wears
moccasins
all
the
french
soldiers
have
larger
feet
and
the
other
two
frenchmen
de
courcelles
and
de
jumonville
wear
boots
sharp
sword
does
not
regard
the
two
officers
with
favor
he
does
not
associate
with
them
more
than
is
necessary
he
keeps
on
the
right
side
of
the
trail
and
they
on
the
left
here
go
his
moccasins
and
there
go
their
boots
and
straight
ahead
is
the
brook
by
the
side
of
which
we
find
their
camp
said
robert
who
had
caught
the
silver
flash
of
water
through
the
green
foliage
the
trail
as
he
had
said
led
to
the
brook
where
the
signs
of
an
encampment
were
numerous
the
fog
was
dense
with
them
as
it
was
with
us
said
tayoga
it
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
moved
about
a
great
deal
walking
over
all
the
ground
before
they
finally
chose
a
place
if
there
had
been
no
fog
or
even
only
a
little
they
could
have
chosen
at
once
what
they
wanted
knowing
that
they
had
no
enemy
strong
enough
to
be
feared
they
kindled
a
fire
here
by
this
log
more
for
the
sake
of
light
than
for
warmth
sharp
sword
did
not
talk
over
anything
with
his
lieutenants
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
his
trail
leads
to
the
north
side
of
the
camp
where
he
wrapped
himself
in
his
blanket
and
lay
down
i
imagine
that
the
canadian
dubois
who
goes
with
him
as
an
attendant
watched
over
him
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
slept
on
the
other
side
of
the
camp
there
go
their
boots
all
the
french
soldiers
but
dubois
lay
down
to
sleep
and
only
the
warriors
watched
they
left
at
dawn
not
stopping
to
eat
breakfast
if
they
had
eaten
birds
would
be
here
hunting
shreds
of
flesh
in
the
grass
but
we
do
not
see
a
single
bird
nor
has
any
wolf
or
other
prowling
animal
been
drawn
by
the
odor
of
food
we
were
right
in
our
surmise
that
sharp
sword
did
not
wish
to
delay
perhaps
there
is
some
force
of
ours
that
he
can
catch
in
a
trap
and
he
wishes
to
repeat
his
success
against
the
mountain
wolf
and
it
is
our
business
to
stop
him
said
willet
if
so
we
must
act
promptly
great
bear
when
sharp
sword
makes
up
his
mind
to
strike
he
strikes
quick
and
hard
after
his
brief
camp
here
he
continued
his
march
toward
the
south
he
threw
out
warriors
as
scouts
and
skirmishers
you
can
see
their
trail
leading
off
into
the
woods
and
then
his
main
force
marched
in
a
close
and
compact
group
just
beyond
the
camp
a
little
while
after
they
made
the
new
start
he
called
de
courcelles
and
de
jumonville
to
him
and
talked
with
them
a
little
here
is
where
his
moccasins
stood
and
here
is
where
their
boots
stood
facing
him
while
they
received
his
orders
then
the
boots
walked
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
luc
must
have
spoken
to
them
very
sharply
why
do
you
say
that
tayoga
asked
grosvenor
you
will
notice
that
here
where
the
trails
of
boots
turn
back
the
stems
of
grass
in
two
or
three
places
are
broken
off
not
crushed
down
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
kicked
them
in
anger
with
the
sharp
toes
of
their
boots
and
they
could
have
been
angry
only
because
sharp
sword
rebuked
them
you
must
be
right
tayoga
it
does
not
admit
of
any
doubt
red
coat
they
took
their
places
at
the
rear
of
the
marching
line
and
sharp
sword
went
on
ahead
at
no
time
does
he
permit
them
to
walk
beside
him
he
still
regards
the
two
frenchmen
with
much
disfavor
and
he
will
continue
to
do
so
though
he
must
use
them
in
his
expedition
tayoga
spoke
in
his
precise
school
english
in
which
he
never
omitted
or
abbreviated
a
word
but
he
was
very
positive
it
did
not
occur
to
any
of
the
others
to
doubt
him
they
had
seen
too
many
evidences
of
his
surpassing
skill
on
the
trail
they
swung
along
and
grosvenor
noticed
that
many
birds
now
appeared
hopping
about
in
the
path
as
if
searching
among
the
bushes
and
in
the
grass
for
something
it
looks
as
if
they
were
seeking
food
dropped
by
our
foes
he
said
did
we
not
say
that
red
coat
would
learn
and
learn
fast
exclaimed
tayoga
he
has
in
him
the
spirit
of
the
forester
and
in
time
he
will
make
a
great
trailer
i
have
observed
the
birds
red
coat
and
your
conclusion
is
correct
sharp
sword
force
did
not
pause
to
cook
breakfast
or
even
to
eat
it
at
the
camp
but
they
took
it
as
they
walked
along
swiftly
dropping
shreds
of
flesh
or
grains
of
hominy
or
bones
picked
clean
as
they
walked
the
birds
have
come
to
feast
on
their
leavings
doubtless
they
have
eaten
all
already
and
are
merely
hunting
for
more
that
does
not
exist
it
is
strange
that
no
prowling
wolf
has
come
ah
i
see
the
nose
of
one
now
in
the
thicket
sharp
sword
and
his
force
can
not
be
very
far
ahead
and
we
shall
have
to
be
very
cautious
how
we
proceed
i
think
it
likely
said
willet
that
tandakora
and
his
band
will
join
him
soon
if
he
is
intending
an
attack
upon
us
somewhere
he
will
want
to
mass
his
full
strength
for
it
tandakora
will
join
him
before
he
makes
his
next
camp
said
tayoga
in
the
most
positive
manner
great
bear
reasons
well
i
expect
to
see
the
trail
of
the
ojibway
chief
within
an
hour
they
went
forward
slowly
lest
they
walk
into
an
ambush
set
by
the
foe
and
before
they
had
gone
two
miles
the
onondaga
pointed
to
a
new
trail
coming
out
of
the
forest
and
merging
into
that
of
luc
dagaeoga
knows
who
has
walked
here
he
said
yes
replied
robert
it
easy
to
tell
where
the
great
feet
of
tandakora
have
passed
i
suppose
he
leaves
bigger
footprints
than
any
other
man
now
in
the
province
of
new
york
his
warriors
were
with
him
too
when
he
joined
luc
we
were
right
in
supposing
that
the
french
leader
meditates
an
attack
upon
us
somewhere
tandakora
talked
a
while
with
luc
said
tayoga
when
they
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
farther
the
big
moccasins
and
the
small
moccasins
stood
together
beside
the
trail
the
earth
was
dampened
much
by
the
fog
last
night
and
it
leaves
the
impressions
i
think
he
talked
longer
with
the
ojibway
than
he
did
with
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
tandakora
is
an
evil
man
but
perhaps
luc
feels
less
dislike
for
him
than
he
does
for
the
two
white
men
the
ojibway
is
only
a
savage
from
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
but
the
frenchmen
should
know
that
the
straight
way
of
life
is
the
right
way
you
do
not
forget
dagaeoga
how
de
courcelles
planned
with
the
others
that
time
we
were
in
quebec
to
have
you
killed
by
the
bully
boucher
i
do
forget
it
said
robert
i
can
never
forget
it
nor
do
i
forget
how
dave
took
my
place
and
sent
the
bully
to
a
land
where
he
can
never
more
do
murder
much
as
i
hate
tandakora
i
do
blame
luc
for
hating
him
less
than
he
does
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
after
the
talk
they
went
on
together
to
the
head
of
the
line
said
tayoga
now
they
increase
their
speed
the
stride
of
luc
lengthens
and
as
it
lengthens
so
must
those
of
all
the
rest
we
are
not
now
in
any
danger
of
running
into
them
but
we
may
incur
it
before
night
they
did
not
abate
their
own
speed
but
continued
in
the
path
without
pause
until
nearly
noon
the
broad
trail
led
straight
on
over
hills
across
valleys
and
always
through
deep
forest
cut
here
and
there
by
clear
streams
the
sun
came
out
and
it
was
warm
under
the
trees
grosvenor
unused
to
such
severe
exertion
of
this
kind
began
to
breathe
with
difficulty
but
tayoga
called
a
halt
in
time
at
the
edge
of
a
brook
and
all
knelt
to
drink
luc
men
were
tired
and
thirsty
too
red
coat
said
the
onondaga
all
of
them
drank
you
can
see
the
prints
of
their
knees
and
feet
as
they
bent
over
the
water
it
is
a
good
brook
manitou
has
filled
the
wilderness
with
its
like
that
man
and
beast
may
enjoy
them
we
will
rest
here
a
while
if
great
bear
and
black
rifle
say
so
we
do
said
the
two
men
together
they
remained
fully
an
hour
by
the
little
stream
robert
himself
used
as
he
was
to
the
wilderness
was
glad
of
the
rest
and
grosvenor
fairly
reveled
in
it
feeling
that
his
nerves
and
muscles
were
being
created
anew
they
also
made
further
inroads
on
their
bear
and
grosvenor
was
glad
to
see
the
birds
coming
for
the
shreds
they
dropped
he
had
quite
a
kindly
feeling
for
the
little
winged
creatures
i
do
want
to
think
that
everything
in
the
woods
is
an
enemy
he
said
when
they
resumed
the
pursuit
they
found
another
new
trail
merging
into
that
of
the
main
force
it
was
a
mixed
band
red
and
white
as
the
character
of
the
footprints
showed
and
numbered
about
twenty
men
it
is
clear
said
tayoga
that
as
we
supposed
sharp
sword
is
planning
a
heavy
stroke
all
the
detached
forces
are
coming
in
under
instructions
to
join
him
we
know
that
montcalm
drew
back
into
the
north
after
his
great
blow
at
fort
william
henry
and
we
think
he
is
going
to
fortify
on
champlain
or
between
the
two
lakes
some
of
our
people
must
be
along
the
shores
of
andiatarocte
and
sharp
sword
does
not
want
them
to
find
out
too
much
about
montcalm
at
any
rate
i
think
our
own
enterprise
will
culminate
before
night
said
willet
we
should
overtake
them
by
dusk
if
we
try
sharp
sword
men
will
make
a
new
camp
before
long
said
tayoga
and
from
that
they
will
launch
their
attack
upon
whatever
point
or
force
of
ours
they
intend
to
attack
they
are
not
going
so
fast
now
and
the
trail
is
growing
very
warm
sharp
sword
stride
is
shortening
and
so
of
course
is
the
stride
of
all
the
others
i
think
he
now
feels
that
the
need
of
hurrying
is
over
and
he
is
likely
to
become
much
more
deliberate
and
the
ground
is
beginning
to
slope
down
toward
a
deep
valley
said
willet
water
and
wood
will
be
plentiful
there
and
i
think
where
luc
will
make
his
camp
i
think
so
too
said
tayoga
and
since
the
dusk
is
not
far
away
maybe
they
have
lighted
the
fire
already
suppose
great
bear
we
climb
the
hill
on
our
right
and
see
if
our
eyes
can
reach
their
smoke
the
crest
of
the
hill
was
about
three
hundred
feet
above
them
but
when
they
reached
it
they
could
see
a
great
distance
on
all
sides
the
lake
a
vast
glittering
bowl
on
their
left
and
the
mighty
green
wilderness
of
hills
mountains
and
woods
on
their
right
directly
ahead
of
them
was
a
faint
dark
line
against
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
sky
smoke
said
tayoga
luc
smoke
said
willet
the
very
smoke
of
the
camp
for
which
we
were
looking
and
which
we
were
expecting
said
black
rifle
robert
pulses
beat
hard
as
they
always
did
when
he
knew
the
great
french
chevalier
to
be
near
but
that
emotion
soon
passed
and
in
its
place
came
the
thought
of
the
enemy
presence
however
much
he
admired
luc
he
was
an
official
foe
to
be
met
upon
the
battlefield
we
must
look
into
their
camp
he
said
so
we
must
said
willet
and
to
do
that
we
shall
have
to
go
much
nearer
the
risk
is
too
great
now
but
it
will
soon
be
night
and
then
we
can
approach
we
can
see
them
well
then
because
they
build
all
the
fires
they
like
since
they
think
they
have
nothing
to
fear
then
the
five
waited
in
silence
among
the
thick
woods
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
grosvenor
prepared
his
mind
for
his
first
stalk
full
of
courage
ambitious
eager
to
excel
he
resolved
to
acquit
himself
with
credit
but
this
was
war
far
different
from
that
on
the
open
fields
of
europe
for
which
his
early
training
had
fitted
him
one
must
lie
in
the
deep
forest
and
depend
upon
the
delicacy
of
eye
and
ear
and
an
exceeding
quickness
of
hand
it
had
not
been
long
since
he
would
have
considered
his
present
situation
incredible
and
even
now
it
required
some
effort
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
true
but
there
beside
him
were
the
comrades
whom
he
liked
so
well
robert
tayoga
and
the
hunter
whom
he
had
known
before
and
the
strange
dark
figure
of
black
rifle
that
man
of
mystery
and
terror
around
him
was
the
wilderness
now
in
the
glow
of
advancing
twilight
and
before
him
he
knew
well
lay
luc
and
the
formidable
french
and
indian
force
time
and
place
were
enough
to
try
the
soul
of
an
inexperienced
youth
and
yet
grosvenor
was
not
afraid
his
own
spirit
and
willingness
to
dare
peril
made
a
shield
for
him
his
comrades
were
only
four
in
number
but
grosvenor
felt
that
in
fact
they
were
twenty
he
did
not
know
what
strange
pass
into
which
they
would
lead
him
but
he
felt
sure
they
would
succeed
he
saw
the
red
rim
of
the
sun
sink
behind
the
western
crests
and
then
the
last
twilight
died
into
the
night
heavy
darkness
trailed
over
the
forest
but
soon
moon
and
stars
sprang
out
and
the
sky
became
silver
the
spire
of
smoke
reappearing
across
its
southern
face
but
willet
who
was
in
reality
the
leader
of
the
little
party
gave
no
sign
grosvenor
knew
that
they
were
waiting
for
the
majority
of
luc
force
to
go
to
sleep
leaving
only
the
sentinels
before
they
approached
but
it
was
hard
to
sit
there
so
long
his
nerves
were
on
edge
and
his
muscles
ached
but
his
spirit
put
a
powerful
rein
over
the
flesh
and
he
said
never
a
word
until
far
in
the
night
willet
gave
the
order
to
advance
be
careful
lads
he
said
and
now
is
your
chance
lieutenant
to
show
how
well
you
can
keep
up
the
start
you
made
as
a
trailer
that
smoke
over
there
which
merges
from
several
camp
fires
is
our
beacon
they
crept
through
the
thickets
grosvenor
saw
the
dark
gray
tower
against
the
sky
grow
larger
and
larger
and
at
last
a
luminous
glow
that
came
from
the
camp
fires
rose
under
the
horizon
to
the
edge
of
this
last
hill
whispered
willet
and
i
think
we
can
see
them
they
redoubled
their
care
as
they
advanced
and
then
thrusting
their
heads
through
the
bushes
looked
down
into
the
little
valley
in
which
the
camp
of
luc
was
pitched
several
fires
were
burning
and
robert
distinctly
saw
the
french
leader
standing
before
one
of
them
not
in
forest
green
but
in
his
splendid
officer
uniform
of
white
and
silver
a
gallant
and
romantic
figure
he
looked
outlined
by
the
blaze
young
lithe
and
strong
again
the
heart
of
the
lad
throbbed
and
he
was
drawn
powerfully
toward
luc
what
was
it
that
caused
this
feeling
and
why
had
the
chevalier
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
at
risk
shown
himself
to
be
his
friend
not
as
many
in
the
camp
as
they
had
expected
had
yet
gone
to
sleep
tandakora
somber
and
gigantic
gnawed
the
flesh
from
the
big
bone
of
a
deer
and
then
throwing
the
bone
into
the
fire
approached
luc
robert
saw
them
talking
and
presently
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
came
also
the
four
talked
a
little
while
and
now
and
then
the
chevalier
pointed
toward
the
south
that
is
where
they
intend
their
blow
to
fall
whispered
tayoga
beyond
a
doubt
lad
the
hunter
whispered
back
but
we
may
be
able
to
anticipate
the
wild
scene
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
looked
upon
before
cast
a
strange
spell
over
grosvenor
he
too
recognized
even
at
the
distance
the
power
of
luc
personality
and
tandakora
looming
immense
in
the
firelight
was
like
some
monster
out
of
an
earlier
primordial
world
warriors
and
soldiers
asleep
were
scattered
before
the
fires
and
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
walked
the
sentinels
it
was
an
alert
and
formidable
camp
and
the
young
englishman
felt
that
he
and
his
comrades
were
grazing
the
extreme
edge
of
danger
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
presently
left
luc
and
went
to
another
fire
where
they
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
their
military
cloaks
spread
over
them
then
the
short
dark
canadian
dubois
appeared
and
luc
spoke
to
him
also
dubois
bowed
respectfully
and
brought
a
blanket
which
he
spread
before
the
fire
luc
lay
down
on
it
and
he
too
was
soon
asleep
it
time
for
us
to
go
whispered
willet
but
i
feel
safer
if
tandakora
also
went
to
sleep
that
savage
is
likely
to
send
out
scouts
tandakora
does
not
mean
to
sleep
said
tayoga
he
suspects
that
we
are
somewhere
near
and
he
is
troubled
if
he
were
not
uneasy
he
would
take
his
rest
which
is
what
a
chief
always
does
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself
but
he
has
thrown
his
second
bone
into
the
fire
and
he
walks
about
looking
now
at
the
sleepers
and
now
at
the
forest
i
think
he
will
soon
send
two
or
three
runners
toward
the
south
see
he
is
speaking
to
them
now
and
two
are
starting
two
indians
left
the
camp
and
glided
silently
into
the
woods
then
tandakora
stopped
his
restless
pacing
and
lay
down
on
the
ground
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
but
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
the
four
on
the
hill
crept
away
as
cautiously
as
they
had
come
and
they
agreed
that
they
would
make
a
curve
around
luc
camp
traveling
all
night
toward
the
south
willet
was
anxious
about
the
two
warriors
whom
tandakora
had
sent
out
and
he
felt
that
they
might
possibly
encounter
them
on
the
way
he
led
his
little
group
first
toward
the
lake
and
then
bore
south
being
quite
sure
that
before
noon
the
next
day
they
would
reach
a
british
or
american
detachment
of
some
kind
everything
indicated
such
proximity
and
they
were
agreed
that
they
would
find
their
friends
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
it
was
not
likely
that
either
colonials
or
regulars
would
leave
the
open
water
and
go
far
into
woods
which
furnished
so
many
perils
they
were
refreshed
by
sleep
and
plenty
of
food
and
they
made
good
time
they
walked
in
single
file
willet
leading
with
tayoga
last
and
grosvenor
in
front
of
him
the
young
englishman
ambition
encouraged
by
success
was
rising
higher
than
ever
and
he
was
resolved
that
this
night
trail
which
he
was
treading
should
be
a
good
one
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
robert
walked
in
front
of
him
and
he
was
careful
to
step
exactly
where
young
lennox
did
knowing
that
if
he
did
so
he
would
break
no
sticks
and
make
no
undue
noise
the
test
was
severe
but
he
succeeded
by
and
by
his
breath
grew
short
once
more
nevertheless
he
was
glad
when
willet
halted
and
asked
tayoga
if
he
heard
any
unusual
sound
in
the
forest
before
replying
the
onondaga
lay
down
and
put
his
ear
to
the
ground
i
do
hear
a
sound
which
is
not
that
of
the
trees
nor
of
an
animal
he
replied
it
is
made
by
men
walking
and
i
think
they
are
the
two
warriors
whom
tandakora
sent
out
from
the
camp
and
if
you
can
hear
them
walking
they
must
be
very
near
that
is
sure
it
is
true
great
bear
these
two
warriors
are
sent
south
to
spy
upon
whatever
force
of
ours
luc
means
to
attack
and
it
may
be
that
they
will
strike
our
trail
although
they
are
not
looking
for
it
there
is
light
enough
now
to
show
our
traces
to
good
trailers
aye
tayoga
you
speak
truly
lie
down
lads
we
must
not
show
ourselves
it
possible
that
they
pass
on
and
not
dream
of
our
presence
here
it
is
in
the
hands
of
manitou
said
the
onondaga
gravely
they
are
still
walking
toward
the
south
at
an
even
pace
which
shows
that
they
have
seen
nothing
i
can
hear
their
footfalls
only
a
whisper
against
the
earth
but
unmistakable
now
they
are
just
behind
us
and
their
course
is
the
same
as
ours
ah
the
footfalls
cease
they
have
stopped
they
have
seen
our
trail
great
bear
manitou
has
given
his
decree
against
us
and
who
are
we
to
complain
he
has
done
so
much
for
us
that
now
he
would
put
us
to
the
test
and
see
whether
we
are
worthy
of
his
favor
we
shall
have
to
fight
the
messengers
it
should
be
easy
enough
for
us
who
are
five
to
beat
two
warriors
said
robert
we
can
surely
beat
two
said
tayoga
but
they
will
try
to
hold
us
while
they
call
help
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
hear
the
cry
of
a
night
bird
doubtless
an
owl
have
they
begun
to
move
again
asked
robert
i
can
not
hear
a
sound
perhaps
they
are
stirring
but
they
creep
so
cautiously
that
they
make
no
noise
at
all
it
would
be
their
object
to
make
their
own
position
uncertain
and
then
we
would
go
on
at
great
peril
from
their
bullets
it
will
be
best
for
us
to
stay
a
while
where
we
are
tayoga
words
were
accepted
at
once
as
wise
by
the
others
it
was
impossible
to
tell
where
the
two
warriors
now
lay
and
if
they
undertook
to
go
on
their
figures
would
be
disclosed
at
once
by
the
brilliant
moonshine
so
they
flattened
themselves
against
the
ground
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
and
waited
patiently
the
time
seemed
to
grosvenor
to
be
forever
but
he
thrilled
with
the
belief
in
coming
combat
he
still
felt
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
all
company
for
forest
and
midnight
battle
and
he
did
not
fear
the
issue
willet
was
hopeful
that
the
skies
would
darken
but
they
did
not
do
so
the
persistent
moon
and
a
host
of
stars
continued
to
shine
down
flooding
the
forest
with
light
and
he
knew
that
if
any
one
of
them
stood
up
a
bullet
would
be
his
instant
welcome
at
last
came
the
cry
of
the
night
bird
the
note
of
the
owl
as
tayoga
had
predicted
rising
from
a
point
to
their
right
and
somewhat
behind
them
but
too
far
away
for
rifle
shot
it
was
a
singular
note
wild
desolate
and
full
of
menace
there
may
have
been
another
band
of
warriors
in
this
direction
whispered
tayoga
perhaps
a
group
of
hunters
who
had
not
yet
returned
to
luc
and
he
is
calling
to
them
no
earthly
doubt
of
it
said
black
rifle
can
you
hear
the
reply
tayoga
now
i
hear
it
though
it
is
very
faint
it
is
from
the
south
and
the
warriors
will
soon
be
here
we
shall
have
a
band
to
fight
then
we
better
bear
off
toward
the
west
said
willet
come
lads
we
have
to
creep
for
it
they
made
their
way
very
slowly
on
hands
and
knees
away
from
the
lake
willet
leading
and
tayoga
bringing
up
the
rear
it
was
hard
and
painful
work
for
grosvenor
but
again
he
succeeded
in
advancing
without
noise
and
he
began
to
think
they
would
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
savage
scouts
when
a
sibilant
whisper
from
willet
warned
them
to
fall
flat
again
his
command
was
just
in
time
as
a
rifle
cracked
in
the
bushes
ahead
of
them
and
grosvenor
distinctly
heard
the
bullet
as
it
hissed
over
their
heads
willet
threw
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
but
quickly
took
it
down
again
the
indian
who
had
fired
was
gone
and
a
little
puff
of
smoke
rising
above
the
bushes
told
where
he
had
been
then
the
five
crept
away
toward
the
right
and
drew
into
a
slight
hollow
rimmed
around
with
bushes
where
they
lay
hugging
the
earth
our
course
took
us
almost
directly
into
the
path
of
that
fellow
said
willet
and
of
course
he
saw
us
i
sorry
i
did
get
a
shot
at
him
do
not
worry
great
bear
said
tayoga
you
will
find
plenty
of
use
for
your
bullets
the
band
has
come
hark
to
the
war
whoop
the
long
piercing
yell
so
full
of
menace
and
most
sinister
in
its
dying
note
swelled
through
the
forest
grosvenor
despite
his
courage
and
confidence
in
his
comrades
shivered
he
had
heard
that
same
yell
many
a
time
when
braddock
army
was
cut
down
in
the
deep
forest
by
an
invisible
foe
he
could
never
forget
its
import
but
he
grasped
his
rifle
firmly
and
strove
to
see
the
enemy
who
he
knew
was
approaching
his
four
comrades
lay
in
silence
but
the
muzzle
of
every
weapon
was
thrust
forward
it
fortunate
we
found
this
little
hollow
said
willet
it
will
give
us
shelter
for
a
while
and
we
need
it
said
black
rifle
they
know
where
we
are
of
course
but
they
take
their
time
about
attacking
keep
your
heads
down
lads
said
willet
do
be
too
eager
to
see
if
they
too
far
away
for
us
to
shoot
at
we
are
too
far
away
for
them
too
five
minutes
later
and
a
flash
came
from
a
thicket
on
their
left
willet
pulled
trigger
at
the
flash
and
a
death
cry
came
back
that
one
out
of
the
way
said
black
rifle
calmly
and
they
mad
clean
through
hear
yell
the
fierce
war
whoop
died
in
many
echoes
and
bullets
spattered
the
rocks
about
them
the
five
made
no
further
reply
as
yet
but
the
forest
battle
was
now
on
chapter
viii
the
boat
builders
robert
and
grosvenor
lay
side
by
side
propped
up
partly
on
their
elbows
their
rifles
thrust
well
forward
and
watching
toward
the
north
they
were
not
able
to
see
anything
save
the
dark
outline
of
the
forest
and
a
little
puff
of
smoke
rising
where
an
indian
had
fired
the
wilderness
itself
was
absolutely
still
but
robert
vivid
imagination
as
usual
peopled
it
thickly
although
his
eye
did
not
reach
any
human
figure
his
mind
pictured
them
everywhere
waiting
patiently
for
a
chance
at
his
comrades
and
himself
he
more
than
any
other
of
the
five
realized
the
full
extent
of
the
danger
his
extraordinary
fancy
pictured
to
him
every
possibility
and
so
his
courage
was
all
the
greater
because
he
had
the
strength
to
face
them
with
a
tranquil
mind
a
flash
in
the
thicket
and
a
bullet
struck
on
a
rock
near
robert
glanced
off
and
buried
itself
in
a
tree
beyond
them
he
shivered
a
little
fancy
pictured
the
bullet
not
as
missing
but
as
hitting
him
then
he
steadied
himself
and
was
as
ready
as
willet
or
black
rifle
for
whatever
might
come
i
think
that
shot
was
fired
by
a
sharpshooter
who
has
crept
forward
ahead
of
the
others
whispered
the
hunter
he
lying
behind
that
low
bush
to
the
west
i
of
your
mind
about
it
said
black
rifle
as
soon
as
he
reloads
he
chance
another
shot
at
where
he
thinks
we
lying
and
that
will
be
his
last
robert
heard
the
low
words
and
he
shivered
again
a
little
he
could
never
grow
used
to
the
taking
of
human
life
even
in
dire
necessity
he
knew
that
willet
had
spoken
the
truth
and
that
the
red
sharpshooter
would
fire
only
one
more
shot
soon
he
had
the
proof
the
second
flash
came
from
the
same
point
again
the
bullet
glanced
among
the
rocks
but
before
the
report
of
the
rifle
died
another
answered
it
was
that
of
the
hunter
and
he
found
his
mark
a
cry
came
from
the
bush
followed
by
a
fierce
yell
of
anger
from
those
farther
back
and
then
the
sinister
stillness
settled
again
over
the
wilderness
the
indian
has
gone
whispered
grosvenor
in
an
awed
tone
to
robert
yes
dave
fired
at
the
flash
and
he
never
misses
the
cry
showed
it
but
it
will
make
the
warriors
all
the
more
eager
to
take
us
the
silence
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
fire
was
opened
upon
them
from
three
sides
bullets
singing
over
their
heads
or
spattering
upon
the
rocks
lie
flat
lads
commanded
willet
this
is
random
lead
and
if
we
keep
close
to
the
earth
all
pass
us
by
the
warriors
are
seldom
good
marksmen
but
one
of
the
bullets
glancing
from
a
rock
nipped
black
rifle
in
the
shoulder
it
was
a
very
slight
wound
though
and
its
only
effect
was
to
make
him
more
eager
to
reach
his
enemy
in
a
few
minutes
his
chance
came
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
dusky
but
incautious
figure
among
the
trees
and
quick
as
a
flash
drew
trigger
on
it
there
was
no
cry
but
he
saw
the
shadowy
figure
go
down
not
to
rise
again
and
the
fierce
soul
of
black
rifle
was
satisfied
scattered
shots
were
fired
after
another
silence
and
a
bullet
grazed
the
back
of
grosvenor
hand
drawing
a
drop
or
two
of
blood
it
stung
for
a
few
moments
but
on
the
whole
he
was
proud
of
the
little
hurt
it
was
a
badge
of
honor
and
made
him
truly
a
member
of
this
great
forest
band
it
also
stimulated
his
zeal
and
he
became
eager
for
a
shot
of
his
own
he
watched
intently
and
when
the
warriors
fired
again
he
sent
his
bullet
at
the
flash
as
he
had
seen
willet
and
black
rifle
do
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
hit
anything
but
he
hoped
tayoga
who
fired
for
the
first
time
presently
brought
down
a
warrior
and
robert
wounded
another
but
willet
and
black
rifle
talked
together
in
whispers
and
they
were
anxious
they
wo
try
to
rush
us
so
long
as
we
keep
among
the
rocks
said
the
hunter
they
know
now
that
we
good
shots
but
they
hold
us
here
until
day
when
their
main
force
will
come
up
and
then
we
be
finished
it
seems
pretty
certain
that
their
plan
now
said
the
scout
and
between
you
and
me
dave
we
got
to
get
away
from
here
somehow
the
moon
has
faded
a
bit
and
that
will
help
us
a
little
what
do
you
think
tayoga
we
did
not
escape
other
traps
to
remain
here
in
this
replied
the
onondaga
we
must
take
the
chance
and
go
in
half
an
hour
perhaps
when
the
clouds
floating
up
there
get
well
before
the
moon
robert
heard
them
distinctly
and
he
glanced
at
the
moon
which
was
steadily
growing
paler
while
the
shadows
were
deepening
over
the
forest
yet
it
was
obvious
that
it
would
not
become
very
dark
and
the
half
hour
of
which
willet
had
spoken
would
probably
measure
the
limit
of
the
increase
can
you
hear
them
moving
in
the
bush
tayoga
asked
willet
the
onondaga
put
his
ear
to
the
ground
only
a
light
sound
toward
the
north
reaches
me
he
replied
warriors
there
seem
to
be
moving
about
it
may
be
that
they
have
received
more
help
i
think
great
bear
that
the
time
for
us
to
go
if
we
go
at
all
is
coming
fast
willet
decided
in
a
few
minutes
that
it
would
not
be
any
darker
than
it
was
then
and
choosing
a
southern
direction
he
crept
from
the
rocks
the
others
following
him
in
line
tayoga
as
usual
bringing
up
the
rear
they
made
a
hundred
yards
in
silence
and
then
at
a
low
signal
from
the
hunter
they
sank
down
almost
flat
every
one
listening
for
a
sound
from
the
besiegers
only
tayoga
was
able
to
hear
faint
noises
to
right
and
left
they
do
not
know
yet
that
we
have
left
the
rocks
he
whispered
and
they
are
still
watching
that
point
manitou
may
carry
us
in
safety
between
them
they
were
about
to
resume
their
painful
creeping
when
a
half
dozen
rifles
on
their
right
flashed
and
they
dropped
down
again
but
the
bullets
did
not
come
their
way
instead
they
rang
among
the
rocks
which
they
had
just
left
tayoga
laughed
softly
they
think
we
are
still
there
he
whispered
and
they
send
much
lead
against
the
inoffensive
stone
the
more
the
better
for
us
i
devoutly
glad
the
rocks
catch
what
is
intended
for
us
said
grosvenor
feeling
intense
relief
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
tayoga
before
i
can
stand
up
and
walk
like
a
man
again
no
one
can
answer
that
question
replied
the
onondaga
but
remember
red
coat
that
you
are
getting
splendid
practice
in
the
art
of
going
silently
along
a
trail
on
a
dark
night
it
is
what
every
forest
runner
must
learn
grosvenor
in
the
dusk
could
not
see
the
twinkle
in
tayoga
eye
but
drawing
upon
fresh
founts
of
courage
and
resolution
he
settled
himself
anew
to
his
task
his
elbows
and
knees
ached
and
it
was
difficult
to
carry
his
rifle
as
he
crawled
along
but
his
ambition
was
as
high
as
ever
and
he
would
not
complain
the
lone
hoot
of
an
owl
came
from
the
point
on
the
right
where
one
of
the
indian
groups
lay
and
it
was
promptly
answered
by
a
like
sound
from
the
left
where
another
group
was
hidden
i
think
they
beginning
to
suspect
that
we
may
have
slipped
away
said
willet
and
they
talking
to
one
another
about
it
now
stalk
the
rocks
to
see
but
that
will
take
time
which
we
can
use
handily
come
on
lads
we
go
as
fast
as
possible
curving
around
a
small
hill
willet
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
others
with
intense
relief
did
likewise
robert
and
grosvenor
joints
were
young
and
elastic
and
the
stiffness
quickly
left
them
but
both
had
done
enough
creeping
and
crawling
for
one
night
all
stood
listening
for
a
minute
or
two
they
heard
no
more
shots
fired
at
the
rocks
but
the
two
owls
began
to
call
again
to
each
other
do
you
understand
them
tayoga
asked
willet
they
talk
the
huron
language
replied
the
onondaga
in
his
precise
fashion
that
is
their
signals
are
those
used
by
the
hurons
they
are
asking
each
other
what
has
happened
at
the
rocks
and
neither
can
tell
their
expression
is
that
of
doubt
impatience
and
worry
they
say
to
each
other
whom
we
believed
we
held
in
a
trap
may
have
broken
out
of
it
it
will
take
time
to
see
and
also
much
peril
if
they
are
still
in
the
trap
because
they
can
use
their
rifles
well
we
annoy
them
much
great
bear
the
big
hunter
chuckled
i
do
mind
that
he
said
their
worries
are
not
my
worries
ah
there
they
go
again
what
are
they
saying
now
tayoga
their
tone
grows
more
anxious
you
can
tell
what
they
feel
by
the
expression
of
the
owl
their
fear
that
we
may
have
stolen
out
of
the
trap
is
increasing
but
they
can
not
know
unless
they
go
and
see
and
then
they
may
be
creeping
into
the
muzzles
of
our
rifles
it
is
a
difficult
problem
that
we
have
given
them
to
solve
great
bear
we
leave
it
for
lads
now
that
we
on
our
feet
we
go
at
speed
they
walked
very
rapidly
but
they
stopped
when
they
heard
once
more
the
faint
cries
of
the
owls
now
almost
lost
in
the
distance
tayoga
interpreted
them
they
are
cries
of
anger
he
said
they
have
discovered
that
we
are
not
in
the
rocks
and
now
they
will
look
around
for
our
trail
which
will
be
hard
to
find
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
keep
on
toward
the
south
as
hard
as
we
can
so
it
would
be
great
bear
but
others
are
coming
up
from
the
south
and
we
would
go
directly
into
their
arms
what
do
you
mean
tayoga
a
number
of
men
are
advancing
and
i
think
they
are
warriors
then
we
have
merely
slipped
out
of
one
trap
to
fall
into
another
it
is
possible
great
bear
it
is
also
possible
that
those
who
come
are
friends
let
me
put
my
ear
to
the
earth
which
is
the
bringer
of
sound
it
is
clear
to
me
that
those
who
walk
toward
us
are
warriors
white
men
would
not
tread
so
lightly
i
do
not
think
great
bear
that
any
force
of
the
indians
who
are
allied
with
the
french
would
be
coming
up
from
the
south
and
the
chances
are
that
these
be
friends
he
sent
forth
the
call
of
a
bird
a
beautiful
clear
note
and
it
was
answered
instantly
with
a
note
as
clear
and
as
beautiful
they
are
friends
said
tayoga
joyfully
these
be
the
ganeagaono
ganeagaono
exclaimed
grosvenor
mohawks
explained
robert
the
keepers
of
the
eastern
gate
the
leading
warriors
of
the
six
nations
and
friends
of
ours
we
are
in
truth
in
luck
ten
dusky
figures
came
forward
to
meet
them
and
with
great
joy
robert
recognized
in
the
leader
the
fierce
young
mohawk
chief
daganoweda
who
once
before
had
come
to
their
help
in
a
crisis
but
it
was
tayoga
who
welcomed
him
first
daganoweda
of
the
clan
of
the
turtle
of
the
nation
ganeagaono
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
the
sight
of
you
is
very
pleasant
to
our
eyes
he
said
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
you
are
my
brother
and
we
are
well
met
the
chief
rejoined
they
saluted
each
other
and
then
daganoweda
greeted
the
others
all
of
whom
were
known
to
him
of
old
save
grosvenor
but
who
was
presented
duly
in
the
ceremonious
style
loved
by
the
iroquois
we
are
pursued
by
men
of
tandakora
said
willet
they
are
not
far
away
now
we
do
not
wish
to
fight
them
because
we
would
hasten
below
with
a
warning
the
black
eyes
of
the
fierce
mohawk
flashed
will
the
great
bear
give
us
his
battle
he
said
he
asked
for
it
as
if
for
a
favor
we
usually
fight
our
own
quarrels
through
replied
willet
but
as
i
said
duty
calls
us
from
here
in
haste
then
since
you
wish
it
daganoweda
we
pass
the
fight
to
you
but
have
you
enough
men
ten
mohawks
are
enough
to
meet
any
wandering
band
of
our
enemies
that
may
be
in
the
woods
replied
the
young
chief
proudly
let
great
bear
and
his
friends
go
in
peace
this
fight
is
ours
despite
the
dusk
robert
saw
daganoweda
eyes
glisten
he
thoroughly
understood
the
fierce
soul
of
the
young
mohawk
chief
who
would
not
let
such
a
brilliant
opportunity
for
battle
pass
him
then
farewell
daganoweda
said
willet
you
have
been
a
friend
at
the
right
moment
he
led
again
in
the
flight
toward
the
south
and
the
five
saw
the
chief
and
his
warriors
passing
the
other
way
sink
into
the
dusk
soon
they
heard
shots
behind
them
and
they
knew
that
the
mohawks
were
engaged
in
battle
with
the
hurons
and
their
friends
they
sped
on
for
a
long
time
and
when
they
stopped
they
were
close
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
the
water
showing
dimly
through
the
trees
i
think
we
may
rest
easy
for
a
while
now
said
willet
i
certain
not
one
of
those
warriors
was
able
to
get
by
the
mohawks
and
not
likely
that
an
enemy
is
within
several
miles
of
us
can
you
hear
anything
tayoga
nothing
replied
the
onondaga
tododaho
on
his
star
tells
me
that
we
have
this
part
of
the
forest
to
ourselves
that
being
so
we
stay
here
a
long
time
lads
you
might
unroll
your
blankets
and
make
the
best
of
things
grosvenor
blanket
had
not
been
taken
from
him
when
he
was
a
prisoner
and
it
was
still
strapped
on
his
back
he
and
robert
found
the
rest
most
welcome
and
they
were
not
slow
in
wrapping
the
blankets
around
their
bodies
and
making
themselves
comfortable
without
willing
it
they
fell
asleep
but
were
awakened
shortly
after
dawn
see
said
willet
pointing
toward
the
south
a
filmy
trail
of
blue
smoke
rose
across
the
clear
blue
sky
that
whatever
it
is
said
the
hunter
is
what
luc
is
advancing
against
but
in
spite
of
all
the
risks
we
run
we
be
there
in
time
to
give
warning
robert
looked
with
the
deepest
interest
at
the
smoke
which
was
a
long
way
off
but
it
seemed
to
rise
from
the
lake
edge
and
he
thought
it
must
be
a
british
or
american
post
it
was
at
a
most
exposed
and
dangerous
point
but
his
heart
thrilled
at
willet
words
yes
in
spite
of
every
danger
that
had
been
thrown
across
their
path
they
would
be
able
to
carry
word
in
time
we
be
there
in
half
an
hour
and
we
know
what
going
forward
said
willet
we
know
before
then
said
grosvenor
confidently
our
marvelous
indian
friend
here
will
tell
us
when
we
half
way
tayoga
smiled
but
said
nothing
and
they
started
again
willet
as
usual
leading
and
the
onondaga
bringing
up
the
rear
the
spire
of
smoke
thickened
and
darkened
and
to
robert
and
grosvenor
it
seemed
most
friendly
and
alluring
it
appeared
to
rise
from
a
little
point
of
land
thrust
into
the
lake
but
they
could
not
yet
see
its
base
owing
to
an
intervening
hill
just
before
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
tayoga
said
wait
a
moment
great
bear
i
think
i
hear
a
sound
from
the
place
where
the
smoke
rises
and
we
may
be
able
to
tell
what
it
means
they
stopped
promptly
and
the
onondaga
put
his
ear
to
the
earth
i
hear
the
sounds
very
distinctly
now
he
said
they
are
of
a
kind
not
often
occurring
on
these
shores
what
are
they
asked
robert
eagerly
they
are
made
by
axes
biting
into
wood
many
men
are
cutting
down
trees
they
building
a
fort
and
they
in
a
hurry
about
it
or
they
would
not
be
felling
trees
so
early
in
the
morning
your
reasoning
about
the
hurry
is
good
dagaeoga
the
white
man
will
not
go
into
the
forest
with
his
ax
at
daybreak
unless
the
need
of
haste
is
great
but
it
is
not
a
fort
they
build
mingled
with
the
fall
of
the
axes
i
hear
another
note
it
is
a
humming
and
a
buzzing
it
is
heard
in
these
forests
much
less
often
than
the
thud
of
the
ax
ah
i
was
in
doubt
at
first
but
i
know
it
now
it
is
the
sound
made
by
a
great
saw
as
it
eats
into
the
wood
a
saw
mill
tayoga
yes
dagaeoga
that
is
what
it
is
and
now
mind
will
tell
us
why
it
is
here
the
logs
that
the
axes
cut
down
are
sawed
in
the
mill
the
saw
would
not
be
needed
if
the
logs
were
to
be
used
for
building
a
fort
the
ax
would
do
it
all
the
logs
are
being
turned
into
planks
and
boards
which
shows
that
they
being
used
for
some
purpose
requiring
much
finer
finish
than
the
mere
building
of
a
fort
now
the
mind
of
dagaeoga
is
working
well
great
bear
and
i
have
been
on
the
point
where
the
new
saw
mill
stands
and
the
timber
there
is
fine
interrupted
willet
just
the
kind
that
white
men
use
when
they
build
long
boats
for
traveling
on
the
lakes
boats
that
will
carry
many
men
and
armband
supplies
we
know
that
a
great
army
of
red
coats
is
advancing
it
expects
to
come
up
george
and
then
probably
to
champlain
to
meet
montcalm
and
to
invade
canada
it
is
an
army
that
will
need
hundreds
of
boats
for
such
a
purpose
and
they
must
be
built
and
they
building
some
of
right
here
on
this
point
before
us
exclaimed
robert
tayoga
smiled
it
is
so
he
said
precisely
there
can
not
be
any
doubt
of
it
a
saw
mill
could
not
be
here
for
any
other
purpose
but
if
we
had
not
come
it
would
be
destroyed
or
captured
before
night
by
st
luc
come
on
lads
and
we
soon
be
among
said
willet
from
the
crest
of
a
hill
they
looked
down
upon
a
scene
of
great
activity
the
sun
was
scarcely
risen
but
more
than
fifty
men
were
at
work
on
the
forest
with
axes
and
at
the
very
edge
of
the
water
a
saw
mill
was
in
active
operation
along
the
shore
where
as
many
more
toiled
were
boats
finished
and
others
in
all
stages
of
progress
soldiers
in
uniform
rifles
on
shoulder
walked
about
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
refreshing
to
the
eyes
of
robert
and
grosvenor
here
were
many
men
of
their
own
race
and
here
were
many
activities
telling
of
great
energy
in
the
war
after
so
much
peril
in
the
forest
they
would
be
glad
to
be
in
the
open
and
with
their
own
kind
again
look
robert
said
willet
do
you
know
them
know
whom
asked
young
lennox
the
officers
of
this
camp
the
lads
in
the
brave
uniforms
if
my
eyes
make
no
mistake
and
they
do
make
any
the
fine
tall
young
fellow
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
water
is
our
philadelphia
friend
captain
colden
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
dave
and
right
glad
am
i
to
see
him
and
there
too
is
wilton
the
fighting
quaker
and
carson
also
why
this
is
to
be
in
truth
a
reunion
willet
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
trumpet
fashion
and
uttered
a
long
piercing
shout
then
the
five
advanced
and
marched
into
the
camp
of
their
friends
where
they
received
a
welcome
amazed
but
full
of
warmth
grosvenor
too
being
made
to
feel
at
home
have
you
dropped
from
the
skies
asked
colden
scarcely
that
replied
robert
laughing
with
pleasure
but
been
shot
out
of
the
forest
and
very
glad
we
are
to
be
here
come
to
tell
you
also
that
we
been
pursued
by
a
strong
french
and
indian
force
led
by
luc
himself
and
that
it
will
be
upon
you
before
nightfall
and
i
trained
in
my
boyhood
not
to
fight
will
have
to
fight
again
said
wilton
i
know
that
none
will
do
it
better
said
robert
but
we
will
give
you
breakfast
said
colden
and
while
you
are
eating
i
will
put
the
camp
in
a
posture
of
defense
we
are
here
building
boats
to
be
used
by
the
army
in
its
advance
against
montcalm
and
we
did
know
that
the
enemy
in
force
was
south
of
crown
point
there
were
several
sheds
and
in
one
of
these
a
most
abundant
breakfast
was
served
to
them
including
coffee
and
white
bread
neither
of
which
they
had
seen
in
a
long
time
and
which
were
most
welcome
while
they
ate
they
saw
the
young
pennsylvania
officers
arranging
their
forces
with
skill
and
rapidity
they
learned
a
lot
since
we
were
with
that
time
at
fort
refuge
said
robert
they
had
to
learn
said
willet
the
forests
in
these
times
are
a
hard
teacher
but
they
bright
and
good
boys
just
the
same
nobody
would
learn
faster
even
as
red
coat
has
learned
to
be
a
scout
and
to
know
the
trail
said
tayoga
but
he
is
not
sorry
to
come
among
white
men
and
to
have
good
food
once
more
no
i
not
said
grosvenor
emphatically
my
ambition
to
be
a
fine
trailer
was
high
last
night
and
it
still
with
me
but
i
had
enough
of
creeping
and
crawling
to
last
me
a
long
time
and
if
we
have
to
fight
again
i
think
i
can
fight
better
standing
up
we
will
have
to
fight
again
be
sure
of
that
said
tayoga
decisively
before
breakfast
was
over
colden
came
to
them
and
robert
told
in
detail
and
with
great
vividness
all
they
had
seen
the
young
philadelphia
captain
face
became
very
grave
it
was
you
who
warned
us
before
fort
refuge
he
said
and
now
you
come
again
you
helped
us
to
success
then
and
you
help
us
now
even
if
your
coming
does
bring
news
of
danger
i
consider
it
a
good
omen
we
be
proud
to
stand
in
line
with
you
once
more
said
robert
although
he
felt
that
with
luc
in
command
the
attack
of
the
french
and
indians
would
be
formidable
colden
would
have
available
for
battle
between
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
two
hundred
men
about
fifty
of
whom
were
soldiers
but
all
the
others
the
boat
builders
and
the
rest
were
capable
fighters
too
they
could
certainly
make
a
powerful
resistance
even
to
the
daring
and
skillful
french
chevalier
and
with
a
certain
number
of
boats
finished
the
lake
also
was
open
to
them
in
case
retreat
became
necessary
luckily
too
luc
had
no
cannon
courageous
captain
colden
considered
their
situation
far
from
desperate
there
was
hope
too
that
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
might
come
not
only
those
he
had
with
him
in
the
night
battle
but
others
as
well
the
mohawks
loving
a
combat
would
not
let
go
by
such
a
one
as
that
now
threatening
willet
rose
from
his
breakfast
and
surveyed
the
position
there
were
no
real
buildings
only
sheds
the
largest
covering
the
saw
mill
and
the
others
used
for
the
protection
of
tools
and
of
the
men
when
they
slept
against
the
weather
all
the
trees
for
a
distance
well
beyond
rifle
shot
had
been
cut
away
for
timber
a
lucky
fact
as
the
hostile
indians
could
not
now
use
them
for
ambush
stout
arms
were
throwing
the
fallen
trees
into
a
long
line
of
breastworks
and
the
place
already
began
to
look
like
a
fortified
point
willet
eyes
glistened
although
luc
beat
us
when
we
were
with
rogers
he
said
i
think
we
hold
him
here
we
certain
advantages
that
will
help
us
mightily
thanks
to
you
and
your
comrades
for
bringing
us
such
timely
warning
repeated
colden
i
confess
that
i
did
not
suspect
any
enemy
was
nearer
than
champlain
and
neither
we
nor
our
superiors
at
albany
have
feared
an
attack
here
it
sure
to
come
said
willet
grosvenor
refreshed
and
reinvigorated
was
taking
an
active
share
in
the
preparations
he
had
smoothed
and
brushed
his
uniform
with
scrupulous
care
and
despite
the
great
hardships
through
which
he
had
passed
looked
once
more
neat
and
trim
he
had
returned
to
his
incarnation
as
a
trim
young
british
officer
adaptable
and
liking
the
americans
equipped
moreover
with
a
certain
experience
of
the
border
he
was
at
once
on
the
best
of
terms
with
colden
wilton
carson
and
the
others
and
was
in
truth
one
of
them
wilton
found
him
a
belt
and
a
small
sword
which
he
buckled
on
and
which
as
a
badge
of
office
gave
him
a
certain
moral
strength
making
him
in
fact
a
thoroughly
happy
man
that
morning
black
rifle
after
food
had
slid
quietly
into
the
forest
to
spy
out
the
enemy
robert
flexible
vivid
his
imagination
always
alive
was
with
tayoga
helping
him
with
the
breastworks
and
keeping
an
eye
at
the
same
time
on
the
forest
the
lake
behind
him
stretched
away
vast
peaceful
and
beautiful
but
he
seldom
looked
at
it
now
he
did
not
anticipate
danger
that
way
it
would
come
through
the
woods
a
gradual
slope
hemmed
in
on
either
side
by
high
cliffs
and
only
a
few
hundred
yards
wide
led
to
the
point
on
which
the
saw
mill
stood
luc
must
approach
by
the
slope
the
cliffs
were
impossible
and
the
longer
he
looked
at
it
the
better
robert
liked
the
position
daring
men
such
as
colden
had
could
hold
it
against
a
much
larger
force
let
luc
come
he
would
find
a
brave
and
ready
defense
dagaeoga
thinks
we
can
hold
the
saw
mill
even
against
sharp
sword
said
tayoga
how
do
you
know
i
think
it
because
it
is
printed
on
dagaeoga
face
when
dagaeoga
fancy
is
alive
which
is
nearly
all
the
time
his
eyes
speak
and
they
tell
one
very
clearly
what
he
thinks
his
eyes
say
that
the
slope
is
narrow
luc
can
come
that
way
only
we
have
here
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
good
rifles
and
in
face
of
the
storm
of
lead
that
we
can
send
against
him
he
can
not
rush
us
that
is
what
the
eyes
and
face
of
dagaeoga
say
you
right
tayoga
that
is
what
my
brain
thinks
though
i
know
it
was
printed
on
my
face
but
it
all
the
easier
for
you
to
read
it
because
you
probably
thinking
the
same
that
i
do
i
do
dagaeoga
since
luc
is
not
able
to
effect
a
surprise
he
has
a
great
task
before
him
though
he
will
persist
in
it
because
he
wants
to
destroy
our
force
and
our
boats
also
but
the
morning
passed
without
any
demonstration
from
the
forest
many
of
the
boat
builders
began
to
believe
it
was
a
false
alarm
and
murmured
at
the
continuous
and
hard
labor
on
the
breastworks
but
colden
knowing
that
willet
and
his
friends
were
to
be
trusted
implicitly
held
them
to
their
tasks
the
hunter
also
looked
into
the
question
of
food
supply
and
found
it
ample
they
had
brought
much
food
with
them
from
albany
and
the
forest
had
furnished
much
more
there
was
no
occasion
for
alarm
on
that
point
since
the
siege
could
not
be
a
long
one
noon
came
and
no
sign
of
the
enemy
willet
began
to
think
the
attack
would
be
postponed
until
night
as
luc
doubtless
had
learned
already
that
he
could
not
carry
the
place
by
surprise
but
he
relied
most
upon
the
word
of
black
rifle
who
had
not
yet
returned
from
the
forest
the
dark
scout
came
back
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
he
told
colden
and
willet
that
he
had
seen
nothing
of
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
though
there
were
indications
in
the
forest
that
they
had
defeated
the
hurons
the
night
before
but
luc
was
at
hand
not
much
more
than
a
mile
away
where
he
had
pitched
a
camp
more
french
and
canadians
had
arrived
and
he
now
led
a
force
of
at
least
five
hundred
men
the
great
majority
of
whom
were
warriors
he
thought
an
attack
would
be
made
after
dark
but
in
what
form
it
was
impossible
to
say
which
means
said
colden
that
i
must
have
sentinels
who
will
never
relax
their
vigilance
particularly
as
the
night
is
going
to
be
dark
said
willet
a
haze
over
the
lake
now
and
the
sun
will
set
in
a
mist
the
twilight
was
heavy
as
he
had
predicted
and
it
was
soon
black
on
the
mountains
and
the
lake
but
within
the
camp
fires
were
burning
throwing
a
cheerful
light
and
many
guards
were
posted
crude
but
effective
fortifications
stretched
all
along
the
forest
side
of
the
camp
and
willet
black
rifle
and
tayoga
were
among
the
stumps
in
front
of
them
no
enemy
would
be
able
to
hide
there
even
in
the
night
wagons
in
which
they
had
brought
their
supplies
were
drawn
up
in
a
circle
and
would
form
an
inner
line
of
defense
robert
was
with
grosvenor
and
wilton
near
the
center
of
the
camp
knowing
the
french
and
indians
as
i
now
do
said
wilton
i
never
doubt
for
an
instant
that
an
attack
will
come
before
morning
my
experience
at
fort
refuge
is
sufficient
indication
it
is
strange
that
i
who
was
reared
not
to
believe
in
fighting
should
now
be
compelled
to
do
it
all
the
time
and
while
my
profession
is
fighting
said
grosvenor
i
always
expected
to
fight
in
the
open
fields
of
europe
and
now
i
learning
my
trade
in
the
deep
forests
of
north
america
where
it
quite
another
sort
of
business
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
lennox
before
we
hear
the
owls
hoot
and
the
wolves
bark
robert
laughed
we
had
a
lot
of
such
signals
in
the
last
few
days
he
replied
but
in
this
country
battles
are
not
always
opened
with
still
i
dare
say
we
hear
out
of
the
forest
in
front
of
them
came
a
long
lonely
hoot
speak
of
the
owl
and
you
hear
his
voice
said
wilton
if
tayoga
were
here
he
could
tell
us
exactly
what
that
owl
who
is
no
owl
but
an
indian
meant
said
grosvenor
also
the
tribe
of
the
indian
his
age
his
complexion
what
he
had
for
supper
how
he
is
feeling
and
whether
he
is
married
or
single
oh
i
assure
you
wilton
you
need
smile
i
seen
the
onondaga
do
things
much
more
marvelous
nothing
short
of
trailing
a
bird
through
the
air
would
really
test
his
wilderness
powers
i
was
smiling
at
your
belief
grosvenor
said
the
young
quaker
i
was
merely
smiling
at
your
earnestness
when
you
tell
me
anything
about
tayoga
skill
on
the
trail
i
shall
believe
it
i
do
care
what
it
is
i
saw
him
do
marvelous
things
when
we
were
at
fort
refuge
the
owl
ceased
its
melancholy
cry
and
no
other
sound
came
from
the
forest
while
the
camp
waited
with
as
much
patience
as
it
could
muster
for
the
attack
chapter
ix
the
masked
attack
light
clouds
floated
before
the
moon
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
ruffled
by
a
southern
wind
as
no
attack
was
anticipated
from
the
south
the
guard
in
that
quarter
was
comparatively
small
but
it
was
composed
nevertheless
of
good
men
the
boat
builders
mostly
but
all
experienced
with
the
rifle
and
under
the
direct
command
of
carson
but
the
main
force
was
always
kept
facing
the
forest
and
there
behind
the
logs
colden
stood
with
the
four
black
rifle
again
being
outside
the
hooting
of
the
owls
had
not
been
repeated
and
the
long
wait
had
become
hard
upon
the
nerves
of
the
young
philadelphia
captain
do
you
feel
sure
that
they
will
attack
he
asked
willet
perhaps
luc
seeing
the
strength
of
our
position
will
draw
off
or
send
to
montcalm
for
cannon
which
doubtless
would
take
a
week
the
hunter
shook
his
head
luc
will
not
go
away
he
said
nor
will
he
send
for
cannon
which
would
take
too
long
he
will
not
use
his
strength
alone
he
will
depend
also
upon
wile
and
stratagem
against
which
we
must
guard
every
minute
i
think
i
take
my
own
men
and
go
outside
we
can
be
of
more
service
there
i
suppose
you
right
but
do
walk
into
danger
i
depend
a
lot
on
you
willet
climbed
over
the
logs
tayoga
robert
and
grosvenor
followed
red
coat
buckled
on
a
sword
and
i
did
not
think
he
would
go
on
a
trail
again
said
tayoga
one
instance
in
which
you
did
read
my
mind
right
rejoined
the
englishman
i
know
that
swords
do
belong
on
the
trail
but
this
is
only
a
little
blade
and
you
fellows
ca
leave
me
behind
i
did
read
your
mind
right
said
tayoga
laughing
softly
i
merely
spoke
of
your
sword
to
see
what
you
would
say
i
knew
all
the
time
that
you
would
come
with
us
the
stumps
where
the
forest
had
been
cut
away
stretched
for
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
up
the
slope
and
a
little
distance
from
the
breastwork
the
dark
shadow
of
black
rifle
came
forward
to
meet
them
nothing
yet
asked
the
hunter
nothing
so
far
three
or
four
good
men
are
with
me
among
the
stumps
but
not
a
warrior
has
yet
appeared
i
suppose
they
know
we
be
on
watch
here
and
it
not
worth
while
taking
so
great
a
risk
they
advanced
to
the
far
edge
of
the
stump
region
and
crouched
there
the
night
was
now
quite
dark
the
moon
almost
hidden
the
stars
but
few
and
the
forest
a
solid
black
line
before
them
why
ca
tayoga
use
his
ears
said
grosvenor
he
hear
them
though
a
mile
away
a
little
farther
on
and
he
will
replied
willet
but
we
in
our
turn
do
dare
to
go
deep
into
the
forest
a
hundred
yards
more
and
the
onondaga
put
ear
to
earth
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
announced
anything
i
hear
footsteps
fairly
near
to
us
he
said
at
last
and
i
think
they
are
those
of
warriors
they
would
be
more
cautious
but
they
do
not
believe
we
are
outside
the
line
of
logs
yes
they
are
warriors
all
warriors
there
is
no
jingle
of
metal
such
as
the
french
have
on
their
coats
or
belts
and
they
are
going
to
take
a
look
at
our
position
they
are
about
to
pass
now
to
our
right
i
also
hear
steps
but
farther
away
on
our
left
and
i
think
they
are
those
of
frenchmen
likely
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
wanting
also
to
look
us
over
said
willet
there
is
another
and
larger
force
coming
directly
toward
us
continued
the
onondaga
and
i
think
it
includes
both
french
and
warriors
this
may
be
the
attack
and
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
fall
back
they
withdrew
a
little
but
remained
among
the
stumps
though
hidden
carefully
robert
himself
could
now
hear
the
advance
of
the
large
force
in
front
of
them
and
he
wondered
what
could
be
luc
plan
of
battle
surely
he
would
not
try
to
take
the
sawmill
by
storm
in
face
of
so
many
deadly
rifles
black
rifle
suddenly
left
the
others
and
crept
toward
the
right
robert
eyes
followed
him
and
his
mind
was
held
by
a
curious
sort
of
fascination
he
knew
that
the
scout
had
heard
something
and
he
almost
divined
what
was
about
to
occur
black
rifle
stopped
a
moment
or
two
at
a
stump
and
then
curved
swiftly
about
it
a
dusky
figure
sprang
up
but
the
war
cry
was
choked
in
the
throat
of
the
huron
and
then
the
knife
wielded
by
a
powerful
arm
flashed
robert
quickly
turned
his
eyes
away
because
he
did
not
wish
to
see
the
fall
of
the
blade
and
he
knew
that
the
end
was
certain
black
rifle
came
back
in
a
few
moments
his
dark
eyes
glittered
but
he
had
wiped
the
knife
and
it
was
in
his
belt
again
his
comrades
will
find
him
in
a
few
minutes
said
willet
and
better
not
linger
here
they
went
back
toward
the
sawmill
and
presently
they
heard
a
terrible
cry
of
rage
a
cry
given
for
the
fallen
warrior
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
grow
used
to
such
yells
said
grosvenor
shuddering
i
never
grown
used
to
yet
said
robert
the
shout
was
followed
by
a
half
dozen
shots
and
a
bullet
or
two
whistled
overhead
but
it
was
clear
that
all
of
them
had
been
fired
at
random
the
warriors
aware
that
the
chance
of
surprise
had
passed
were
venting
their
wrath
in
noise
willet
suddenly
raised
his
own
rifle
and
pulled
the
trigger
another
dusky
figure
sprang
up
and
then
fell
prone
they
were
coming
too
close
he
said
that
be
a
warning
now
back
lads
to
the
breastwork
as
they
retreated
the
shots
and
yells
increased
the
forest
ringing
with
the
whoops
while
bullets
pattered
on
the
stumps
both
grosvenor
and
robert
were
glad
when
they
were
inside
the
logs
once
more
and
colden
was
glad
to
see
them
for
all
i
knew
you
had
fallen
he
said
and
i
ca
spare
you
we
left
our
mark
on
said
the
saturnine
black
rifle
they
know
we
waiting
for
the
demonstration
increased
in
volume
the
whole
forest
ringing
with
the
fierce
whoops
stout
nerves
even
had
good
excuse
for
being
shaken
and
colden
paled
a
little
but
his
soul
was
high
sound
and
fury
but
no
attack
he
said
willet
looked
at
him
approvingly
you
become
a
true
forest
leader
captain
colden
he
said
learned
to
tell
the
real
rush
from
the
pretended
one
they
wo
try
anything
yet
a
while
but
they
madder
than
hornets
and
sure
to
move
on
us
later
you
just
watch
yet
colden
wilton
and
the
others
were
compelled
to
argue
with
the
men
especially
with
the
boat
builders
and
wood
choppers
stern
military
discipline
was
unknown
then
in
the
forest
the
private
often
considered
himself
a
better
man
than
his
officer
and
frequently
told
him
so
troops
from
the
towns
or
the
older
settled
regions
seemed
never
to
grow
used
to
indian
methods
of
warfare
they
walked
again
and
again
into
the
same
sort
of
ambush
now
they
felt
sure
because
the
indian
fire
had
evaporated
in
scattered
shots
that
the
french
and
the
warriors
had
gone
away
and
that
they
might
as
well
be
asleep
save
for
the
guards
but
colden
repressed
them
with
a
stern
hand
if
it
had
been
for
our
experience
at
fort
refuge
i
might
feel
that
way
myself
he
said
the
silence
is
certainly
consoling
and
makes
one
feel
that
all
danger
has
passed
the
silence
is
what
i
dread
most
said
robert
is
anything
stirring
on
the
lake
not
a
thing
replied
wilton
who
had
been
watching
in
that
quarter
i
never
saw
george
look
more
peaceful
robert
suggested
that
they
go
down
to
the
shore
again
and
wilton
grosvenor
and
he
walked
through
the
camp
not
stopping
until
they
stood
at
the
water
edge
you
surely
do
anticipate
anything
here
said
wilton
i
do
know
replied
robert
thoughtfully
but
our
enemies
both
french
and
indians
are
full
of
craft
we
must
guard
against
wile
and
stratagem
wilton
looked
out
over
the
lake
where
the
gentle
wind
still
blew
and
the
rippling
waters
made
a
slight
sighing
sound
almost
like
a
lullaby
the
opposite
cliffs
rose
steep
and
lofty
showing
dimly
through
the
dusk
but
there
was
no
threat
in
their
dark
wall
to
south
and
north
the
surface
melted
in
the
darkness
but
it
too
seemed
friendly
and
protecting
wilton
shook
his
head
no
peril
could
come
by
that
road
but
he
held
his
peace
he
had
his
opinion
but
he
would
not
utter
it
aloud
against
those
who
had
so
much
more
experience
than
he
the
darkness
made
a
further
gain
the
pallid
moon
went
wholly
out
and
the
last
of
the
stars
left
but
they
had
ample
wood
inside
the
camp
and
they
built
the
fires
higher
the
flames
lighting
up
the
tanned
eager
faces
of
the
men
and
gleaming
along
the
polished
barrels
of
their
long
rifles
willet
had
inspected
the
supply
of
ammunition
and
he
considered
it
ample
that
fear
was
removed
from
his
mind
tayoga
went
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
again
and
reported
no
apparent
movement
in
the
force
of
luc
but
they
had
built
a
great
fire
of
their
own
and
did
not
mean
to
go
away
the
attack
would
come
some
time
or
other
but
when
or
how
no
man
could
tell
robert
who
could
do
as
he
pleased
concluded
to
stay
with
wilton
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
where
the
darkness
was
continually
creeping
closer
to
the
shore
the
high
cliffs
on
the
far
side
were
lost
to
sight
and
only
a
little
of
andiatarocte
surface
could
now
be
seen
the
wind
began
to
moan
wilton
shivered
the
lake
do
look
as
friendly
as
it
did
an
hour
ago
he
said
a
crash
of
shots
from
the
slope
followed
his
words
the
war
whoop
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
bullets
rattled
among
the
stumps
and
on
the
crude
stockade
the
real
attack
said
wilton
perhaps
said
robert
he
was
about
to
turn
away
and
join
in
the
defense
but
an
impulse
from
some
unknown
source
made
him
stay
wilton
duty
kept
him
there
though
he
chafed
to
be
on
the
active
side
of
the
camp
the
sharp
crack
of
rifles
showed
that
the
defenders
were
replying
and
they
sent
forth
a
defiant
cheer
they
may
creep
down
to
the
edge
of
the
stumps
and
try
to
pick
off
our
men
said
robert
but
they
wo
make
a
rush
luc
would
never
allow
it
i
do
understand
this
demonstration
it
must
be
a
cover
for
something
else
he
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
darkness
and
listened
to
the
moan
of
the
lake
had
the
foe
a
fleet
he
might
have
expected
an
attack
that
way
but
he
knew
that
for
the
present
the
british
and
americans
controlled
andiatarocte
the
darkness
was
still
gathering
on
the
water
he
could
not
see
twenty
yards
from
the
land
but
behind
him
everything
was
brightness
the
fires
had
been
replenished
the
men
lined
the
stockade
and
were
firing
fast
cheers
replied
to
whoops
smoke
of
battle
overhung
the
camp
and
drifted
off
into
the
forest
robert
looked
toward
the
stockade
again
it
was
his
impulse
to
go
and
again
he
stayed
there
was
a
slight
gurgling
in
the
water
almost
at
his
feet
and
a
dark
figure
rose
from
the
waves
followed
in
an
instant
by
another
and
then
by
many
more
robert
his
imagination
up
and
leaping
thrilled
with
horror
he
understood
at
once
they
were
attacked
by
swimming
savages
while
the
great
shouting
and
turmoil
in
their
front
was
going
on
a
line
of
warriors
had
reached
the
lake
somewhere
in
the
darkness
and
were
now
in
the
camp
itself
he
was
palsied
only
for
a
moment
then
his
faculties
were
alive
and
he
saw
the
imminent
need
leaping
back
he
uttered
a
piercing
shout
and
drawing
his
pistol
he
fired
point
blank
at
the
first
of
the
warriors
wilton
who
had
felt
the
same
horror
at
sight
of
the
dark
faces
fired
also
and
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
as
men
came
to
their
help
the
warriors
were
armed
only
with
tomahawk
and
knife
and
they
had
expected
a
surprise
which
they
might
have
effected
if
it
had
not
been
for
robert
keenness
but
more
of
them
came
continually
and
they
made
a
formidable
attack
sending
forth
yell
after
yell
as
a
signal
to
their
comrades
in
front
that
they
had
landed
they
rushed
forward
neither
robert
nor
wilton
ever
had
any
clear
idea
of
that
fierce
combat
in
the
dark
the
defenders
fired
their
rifles
and
pistols
if
they
had
time
and
then
closed
in
with
cold
steel
meanwhile
the
attack
on
the
front
redoubled
but
here
at
the
water
edge
it
was
fiercest
borderer
met
warrior
and
now
and
then
locked
in
the
arms
of
one
another
they
fell
and
rolled
together
into
the
lake
grosvenor
came
too
and
after
firing
his
pistols
he
drew
his
small
sword
plunging
into
the
thick
of
the
combat
thrusting
with
deadly
effect
the
savages
were
hurled
back
but
more
swimming
warriors
came
to
their
aid
dark
heads
were
continually
rising
from
the
lake
and
stalwart
figures
almost
naked
sprang
to
the
shore
tomahawks
and
knives
gleamed
and
the
air
echoed
with
fierce
whoop
of
indian
and
shout
of
borderer
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
camp
too
the
attack
was
now
pressed
with
unrelenting
vigor
the
shrill
call
of
a
whistle
showed
that
luc
himself
was
near
and
frenchmen
canadians
and
indians
at
the
edge
of
the
cleared
ground
and
in
the
first
line
of
stumps
poured
a
storm
of
bullets
against
the
breastwork
and
into
the
camp
many
of
the
defenders
were
hit
some
mortally
the
gallant
colden
had
his
fine
three
cornered
hat
of
which
he
was
very
proud
shot
away
but
calm
and
resolute
he
strode
about
among
his
men
handling
his
forces
like
the
veteran
that
he
had
become
strengthening
the
weak
points
applauding
the
daring
and
encouraging
the
faltering
willet
who
was
crouched
behind
the
logs
firing
his
rifle
with
deadly
effect
glanced
at
him
more
than
once
with
approval
do
you
think
we
can
hold
off
tayoga
the
hunter
said
to
the
onondaga
who
was
by
his
side
aye
great
bear
we
can
replied
tayoga
they
will
not
be
able
to
enter
our
camp
here
but
this
is
not
their
spearhead
they
expect
to
thrust
through
on
the
side
of
the
water
where
they
have
come
swimming
hark
to
the
shouts
behind
us
and
the
two
lads
robert
and
the
young
englishman
have
gone
there
i
think
you
judge
aright
about
that
being
their
spearhead
we
go
there
too
choosing
a
moment
when
they
were
not
observed
by
the
others
lest
it
might
be
construed
as
a
withdrawal
in
the
face
of
force
they
slipped
away
from
the
logs
it
was
easy
to
find
such
an
opportunity
as
the
camp
was
now
full
of
smoke
from
the
firing
drifting
over
everything
and
often
hiding
the
faces
of
the
combatants
from
their
comrades
only
a
few
yards
away
but
the
battle
raged
most
fiercely
along
the
water
edge
there
it
was
hand
to
hand
and
for
a
while
it
looked
as
if
the
dusky
warriors
would
make
good
their
footing
to
the
defenders
it
seemed
that
the
lake
spewed
them
forth
continually
and
that
they
would
overwhelm
with
weight
of
numbers
yet
the
gallant
borderers
would
not
give
back
and
encouraging
one
another
with
resounding
cheers
they
held
the
doubtful
shore
into
this
confused
and
terrible
struggle
willet
and
tayoga
hurled
themselves
and
their
arrival
was
most
opportune
push
back
lads
push
back
into
the
water
with
shouted
the
stalwart
hunter
and
emptying
rifle
and
pistol
he
clubbed
the
former
striking
terrific
blows
tayoga
tomahawk
in
hand
went
up
and
down
like
a
deadly
flame
soldiers
and
borderers
came
to
the
danger
point
and
the
savages
were
borne
back
not
one
of
them
coming
from
the
water
was
able
to
enter
the
camp
the
terrible
line
of
lead
and
steel
that
faced
them
was
impassable
and
all
the
time
the
tremendous
shouts
of
willet
poured
fresh
courage
and
zeal
into
the
young
troops
and
the
borderers
at
lads
at
he
cried
push
back
throw
into
the
water
show
they
ca
enter
our
camp
that
the
back
door
like
the
front
door
is
closed
that
the
way
good
for
you
grosvenor
a
sword
is
a
deadly
weapon
when
one
knows
how
to
use
it
a
wonderful
blow
for
you
tayoga
but
you
always
deal
wonderful
ones
careful
robert
the
tomahawk
now
lads
drive
drive
hard
the
men
united
in
one
mighty
rush
that
the
warriors
could
not
withstand
they
were
hurled
back
from
the
land
and
after
their
fashion
when
a
blow
had
failed
they
quit
in
sudden
and
utter
fashion
springing
into
the
water
and
swimming
with
all
their
power
they
disappeared
in
the
heavy
darkness
which
now
hovered
close
to
shore
many
of
the
young
soldiers
carried
away
by
the
heat
of
combat
were
about
to
leap
into
the
lake
and
follow
them
but
willet
running
up
and
down
restrained
their
eager
spirits
no
no
he
cried
do
do
that
they
be
a
match
for
you
in
the
water
we
won
and
we
keep
what
we
won
all
the
warriors
who
had
landed
save
the
dead
were
now
gone
evidently
swimming
for
some
point
near
by
and
the
battle
in
front
as
if
by
a
preconcerted
signal
also
sank
down
suddenly
then
silver
whistle
was
heard
and
french
and
indians
alike
drew
off
robert
stood
dazed
by
the
abrupt
end
of
the
combat
his
blood
was
hot
and
millions
of
black
specks
danced
before
his
eyes
the
sudden
silence
after
so
much
shouting
and
firing
made
his
pulses
beat
like
the
sound
of
drums
in
his
ears
he
held
an
empty
pistol
in
his
right
hand
but
he
passed
his
left
palm
over
his
hot
face
and
wiped
away
the
mingled
reek
of
perspiration
and
burned
gunpowder
grosvenor
stood
near
him
staring
at
the
red
edge
of
his
own
sword
put
up
your
weapon
red
coat
said
tayoga
calmly
the
battle
is
over
for
the
time
and
we
won
exclaimed
grosvenor
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
real
when
i
saw
all
those
dark
figures
coming
out
of
the
water
then
he
shuddered
violently
and
in
sudden
excess
of
emotion
flung
his
sword
from
him
but
he
went
a
moment
later
and
picked
it
up
again
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
on
every
side
but
the
price
paid
was
large
fifteen
men
were
dead
and
many
others
were
wounded
the
bodies
of
seventeen
indians
who
had
fallen
in
the
water
attack
were
found
and
were
consigned
to
the
waves
others
with
their
french
allies
had
gone
down
on
the
side
of
the
forest
but
most
of
the
fallen
had
been
taken
away
by
their
comrades
it
was
a
victory
for
colden
and
his
men
but
it
left
serious
alarm
for
the
future
luc
was
still
in
the
forest
and
he
might
attack
again
in
yet
greater
force
besides
they
would
have
to
guard
against
many
a
cunning
and
dangerous
device
from
that
master
of
forest
warfare
colden
called
a
council
at
which
willet
and
black
rifle
were
central
figures
and
they
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
strengthen
their
log
outworks
and
to
practice
eternal
vigilance
then
they
began
to
toil
anew
on
the
breastworks
strengthening
them
with
fresh
timber
of
which
fortunately
they
had
a
vast
supply
as
so
much
had
been
cut
to
be
turned
into
boats
a
double
guard
was
placed
at
the
water
edge
lest
the
warriors
come
back
for
a
new
attack
and
the
wounded
were
made
as
comfortable
as
the
circumstances
would
admit
luckily
willet
and
many
others
were
well
acquainted
with
the
rude
but
effective
border
surgery
much
of
it
learned
from
the
indians
and
they
were
able
to
give
timely
help
the
hurt
endured
in
silence
their
frontier
stoicism
did
not
allow
them
to
give
voice
to
pain
blankets
were
spread
for
them
under
the
sheds
or
in
the
sawmill
and
some
despite
their
injuries
fell
asleep
from
exhaustion
soldiers
and
borderers
walked
behind
the
palisades
others
continually
molded
bullets
while
some
were
deep
in
slumber
waiting
their
turn
to
be
called
for
the
watch
it
began
to
rain
by
and
by
not
heavily
but
a
slow
dull
seeping
fall
that
was
inexpressibly
dreary
and
the
thick
clammy
darkness
shot
with
mists
and
vapors
from
the
lake
rolled
up
to
the
very
edge
of
the
fires
robert
might
have
joined
the
sleepers
as
he
was
detached
from
immediate
duty
but
his
brain
was
still
too
much
heated
to
admit
it
despite
his
experience
and
his
knowledge
that
it
could
not
be
so
his
vivid
fancy
filled
forest
and
water
with
enemies
coming
forward
to
a
new
attack
he
saw
luc
sword
in
hand
leading
them
and
shaking
his
body
violently
he
laughed
at
himself
this
would
never
do
what
does
dagaeoga
see
that
is
so
amusing
asked
tayoga
nothing
tayoga
i
was
merely
ridiculing
myself
for
looking
into
the
blackness
and
seeing
foes
who
are
not
there
and
yet
we
all
do
it
if
our
enemies
are
not
there
they
are
at
least
not
far
away
i
have
been
outside
with
black
rifle
and
we
have
been
into
the
edge
of
the
forest
sharp
sword
makes
a
big
camp
and
shows
all
the
signs
of
intending
to
stay
long
we
may
yet
lose
the
sawmill
it
is
best
to
understand
the
full
danger
what
does
dagaeoga
mean
to
do
now
i
think
i
go
back
to
the
water
edge
and
help
keep
the
watch
there
that
seems
to
be
my
place
he
found
wilton
still
in
command
of
the
lake
guard
and
grosvenor
with
him
the
young
quaker
had
been
shocked
by
the
grim
battle
but
he
showed
a
brave
front
nevertheless
he
had
put
on
his
military
cloak
to
protect
himself
from
the
rain
and
robert
and
grosvenor
had
borrowed
others
for
the
same
purpose
we
won
a
victory
said
wilton
but
as
i
gather
it
not
final
that
luc
whose
name
seems
to
inspire
so
much
terror
will
come
again
am
i
not
right
lennox
you
right
wilton
luc
will
come
not
a
second
time
only
but
a
third
and
a
fourth
if
necessary
and
ca
we
expect
any
help
we
supposed
to
have
command
of
this
lake
for
the
present
i
know
of
none
the
three
walked
up
and
down
listening
to
the
mournful
lapping
of
the
waves
on
the
beach
and
the
sigh
of
the
dripping
rain
the
stimulus
of
excited
action
had
passed
and
they
felt
heavy
and
depressed
they
could
see
only
a
few
yards
over
the
lake
and
must
depend
there
upon
ear
to
warn
them
of
a
new
attack
that
way
the
fact
added
to
their
worries
but
luckily
tayoga
with
his
amazing
powers
of
hearing
joined
them
establishing
at
once
what
was
in
effect
a
listening
post
although
it
was
not
called
then
by
that
name
wilton
drew
much
strength
from
the
presence
of
the
onondaga
while
it
made
the
confidence
of
grosvenor
supreme
now
we
surely
know
if
they
come
he
said
a
long
while
passed
without
a
sign
but
they
did
not
relax
their
vigilance
a
particle
and
tayoga
interpreted
the
darkness
for
them
there
was
a
little
wind
he
said
after
a
while
but
it
is
almost
dead
now
the
waves
are
running
no
longer
i
hear
a
slight
sound
to
the
south
which
was
not
there
before
i
hear
nothing
tayoga
said
robert
perhaps
not
dagaeoga
but
i
hear
it
which
is
enough
the
sound
is
quite
faint
but
it
is
regular
like
the
beating
of
a
pulse
now
i
can
tell
what
it
is
it
is
the
stroke
of
a
paddle
there
is
a
canoe
upon
the
lake
passing
in
front
of
us
it
is
not
the
canoe
of
a
friend
or
it
would
come
at
once
to
the
land
it
contains
only
one
man
how
do
i
know
red
coat
because
the
canoe
is
so
small
the
stroke
of
the
paddle
is
light
and
yet
the
canoe
moves
swiftly
a
canoe
heavy
enough
to
hold
two
men
could
not
be
moved
so
fast
without
a
stroke
also
heavy
how
do
i
know
it
is
going
fast
dagaeoga
do
not
ask
such
simple
questions
because
the
sound
of
the
paddle
stroke
moving
rapidly
toward
the
north
shows
it
doubtless
some
of
sharp
warriors
brought
with
them
a
canoe
overland
and
they
are
now
using
it
to
spy
upon
us
what
can
we
do
about
it
tayoga
nothing
red
coat
ah
the
canoe
has
turned
and
is
now
going
back
toward
the
south
but
more
slowly
the
man
in
it
could
locate
our
camp
easily
by
the
glow
of
the
fires
through
the
mist
and
vapors
perhaps
he
can
see
a
dim
outline
of
our
figures
and
one
of
us
may
get
a
bullet
while
we
stand
here
watching
no
red
coat
it
is
not
at
all
likely
his
aim
would
be
extremely
uncertain
in
the
darkness
the
warrior
is
not
usually
a
good
marksman
nor
is
it
his
purpose
here
to
shoot
he
would
rather
spy
upon
us
without
giving
an
alarm
ah
the
man
has
now
stopped
his
southward
journey
and
is
veering
about
uncertainly
he
dips
in
the
paddle
only
now
and
then
that
is
strange
all
his
actions
express
doubt
uncertainty
and
even
alarm
what
do
you
think
has
happened
tayoga
manitou
yet
has
the
secret
in
his
keeping
dagaeoga
but
if
we
wait
in
patience
a
little
it
may
be
revealed
to
me
the
canoe
is
barely
moving
and
the
man
in
it
watches
now
his
paddle
makes
a
little
splash
as
he
turns
slightly
to
the
right
it
is
certain
that
he
has
been
alarmed
the
spy
thinks
he
is
being
spied
upon
and
doubtless
he
is
right
he
grows
more
and
more
uneasy
he
moves
again
he
moves
twice
in
an
aimless
fashion
although
we
do
not
see
him
in
the
flesh
it
is
easy
to
tell
that
he
is
trying
to
pierce
the
darkness
with
his
eyes
not
to
make
out
us
but
to
discern
something
very
near
the
canoe
his
alarm
grows
and
probably
with
good
cause
ah
he
has
made
a
sudden
powerful
stroke
with
the
paddle
shooting
the
canoe
many
feet
to
the
left
but
it
is
too
late
too
late
for
what
tayoga
exclaimed
robert
the
onondaga
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
or
two
but
stood
tense
and
strained
his
eyes
his
whole
attitude
showed
excitement
a
rare
thing
with
him
it
was
too
late
he
repeated
whatever
threatened
the
man
in
the
canoe
whatever
the
danger
was
it
has
struck
i
heard
a
little
splash
it
was
made
by
the
man
falling
into
the
water
he
has
gone
now
what
has
become
of
the
canoe
perhaps
the
warrior
when
he
fell
dropped
the
paddle
into
the
water
and
the
canoe
is
drifting
slowly
away
no
i
think
some
one
is
swimming
to
it
ah
he
is
in
the
canoe
now
and
he
has
recovered
the
paddle
i
hear
the
strokes
which
are
different
from
those
made
by
the
man
who
was
in
it
before
they
have
a
longer
sweep
the
new
man
is
stronger
he
is
very
powerful
and
he
does
not
take
the
canoe
back
and
forth
he
is
coming
toward
the
land
stand
here
and
we
will
welcome
daganoweda
of
the
ganeagaono
it
might
be
some
other
but
i
do
not
think
it
possible
it
is
surely
daganoweda
a
canoe
shot
from
the
mists
and
vapors
the
fierce
young
mohawk
chief
put
down
the
paddle
and
stepping
from
the
light
craft
into
the
shallow
water
raised
his
hand
in
a
proud
salute
he
was
truly
a
striking
figure
the
dusk
enlarged
him
until
he
appeared
gigantic
he
was
naked
except
for
belt
and
breech
cloth
and
water
ran
from
his
shining
bronze
body
a
tomahawk
and
knife
in
the
belt
were
his
only
weapons
but
robert
knew
instinctively
that
one
of
them
had
been
wielded
well
welcome
daganoweda
he
said
we
were
not
looking
for
you
but
if
we
had
taken
thought
about
it
we
might
have
known
that
you
would
come
the
dark
eyes
of
the
mohawk
flashed
and
his
figure
seemed
to
grow
in
stature
there
has
been
a
battle
he
said
and
sharp
sword
with
a
great
force
is
pressing
hard
upon
the
white
brothers
of
the
ganeagaono
it
was
not
possible
for
daganoweda
to
stay
away
that
is
true
you
are
a
great
chief
you
scent
the
conflict
afar
and
you
always
come
to
it
our
people
could
have
no
truer
no
braver
ally
the
arrival
of
daganoweda
alone
is
as
the
coming
of
ten
men
the
nostrils
of
the
chief
dilated
obviously
he
was
pleased
at
robert
round
and
swelling
sentences
i
come
in
the
canoe
of
a
foe
he
said
the
warrior
who
was
in
it
has
gone
into
the
lake
we
know
that
tayoga
who
is
a
wonder
for
hearing
and
a
still
greater
wonder
at
interpreting
what
he
hears
followed
your
marvelous
achievement
and
told
us
every
step
in
its
progress
he
even
knew
that
it
was
you
and
announced
your
coming
through
the
mists
and
vapors
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
is
a
great
warrior
and
the
greatest
trailer
in
the
world
even
though
he
be
so
young
tayoga
said
nothing
and
his
face
did
not
move
but
his
eyes
gleamed
do
you
come
alone
asked
robert
the
warriors
who
were
with
me
when
you
met
us
in
the
woods
are
at
hand
replied
the
chief
and
they
await
my
signal
they
have
crept
past
the
line
of
sharp
sword
though
tandakora
and
many
men
watched
and
are
not
far
away
i
will
call
them
he
sent
forth
twice
the
harsh
cry
of
a
water
fowl
there
was
no
answer
but
he
did
not
seem
to
expect
any
standing
at
attention
every
line
of
his
figure
expressing
supreme
confidence
the
others
shared
his
belief
i
hear
them
they
come
said
tayoga
at
length
presently
a
slight
sound
as
of
long
easy
strokes
reached
them
all
and
in
a
few
moments
a
line
of
dark
heads
appeared
through
the
mists
and
vapors
then
the
mohawks
swam
to
land
carrying
their
rifles
and
ammunition
daganoweda
too
on
their
heads
and
stood
up
in
a
silent
and
dripping
line
before
their
chief
it
is
well
said
daganoweda
looking
them
over
with
an
approving
eye
you
are
all
here
and
we
fight
in
the
next
battle
beside
our
white
brothers
a
battle
that
you
would
be
loath
to
miss
and
right
glad
we
are
to
welcome
such
sturdy
help
said
the
voice
of
willet
behind
them
tell
captain
colden
that
you
here
the
young
captain
came
at
once
and
welcomed
daganoweda
in
proper
dignified
fashion
blankets
and
food
were
given
to
the
mohawks
and
they
ate
and
warmed
themselves
by
the
fire
they
were
not
many
but
robert
knew
they
were
a
great
addition
the
fiery
spirit
of
daganoweda
alone
was
worth
twenty
men
i
think
that
we
better
seek
sleep
now
said
young
lennox
to
grosvenor
i
admit
one
is
tempted
to
stay
awake
that
he
may
see
and
hear
everything
but
sooner
or
later
you
got
to
rest
they
found
a
good
place
under
one
of
the
sheds
and
wrapped
in
blankets
soon
sank
to
slumber
the
day
after
such
a
momentous
night
came
dark
and
gloomy
with
the
rain
still
dripping
a
north
wind
had
arisen
and
high
waves
chased
one
another
over
the
lake
there
was
still
much
fog
on
the
land
side
and
under
its
cover
the
french
and
indians
were
stalking
the
camp
firing
at
every
incautious
head
most
of
those
bullets
are
french
said
tayoga
because
the
warriors
are
not
good
sharpshooters
and
they
are
aimed
well
i
think
that
sharp
sword
has
selected
all
the
best
french
and
canadian
marksmen
and
has
sent
them
down
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
to
harass
us
as
long
as
the
fog
hangs
there
we
may
expect
their
bullets
the
fire
of
these
hidden
sharpshooters
soon
became
terribly
harassing
from
points
of
vantage
they
sent
their
bullets
even
into
the
very
heart
of
the
camp
not
a
head
or
a
shoulder
not
an
arm
could
be
exposed
three
men
were
killed
a
dozen
more
were
wounded
and
the
spirit
of
the
garrison
was
visibly
affected
at
the
suggestion
of
willet
colden
selected
thirty
sharpshooters
of
his
own
and
sent
them
among
the
stumps
to
meet
the
french
and
canadian
riflemen
robert
and
tayoga
were
in
this
band
and
willet
himself
led
it
daganoweda
and
three
of
his
warriors
who
were
good
shots
also
went
along
black
rifle
was
already
outside
on
one
of
his
usual
solitary
but
fierce
all
the
men
as
soon
as
they
left
the
breastworks
lay
almost
flat
on
the
wet
ground
and
crept
forward
with
the
utmost
care
it
was
a
service
of
extreme
danger
none
could
be
more
so
and
it
was
certain
that
not
all
of
them
would
come
back
chapter
x
in
the
fog
when
robert
went
into
the
fog
and
began
to
creep
from
stump
to
stump
his
imagination
leaped
up
at
once
and
put
a
foe
at
every
point
in
front
of
him
perhaps
he
deserved
more
credit
for
courage
and
daring
than
any
of
the
others
because
his
vivid
fancy
foresaw
all
the
dangers
and
more
tayoga
was
on
his
right
and
willet
on
his
left
daganoweda
who
had
all
the
eagerness
of
black
rifle
himself
was
farther
down
the
line
flashes
of
fire
appeared
now
and
then
in
the
fog
ahead
of
them
and
bullets
hummed
over
their
heads
robert
essentially
humane
began
to
share
nevertheless
the
zeal
of
these
hunters
of
men
around
him
the
french
and
canadians
were
seeking
their
lives
and
they
must
strike
back
he
peered
through
the
fog
looking
for
a
chance
to
fire
forgetting
the
wet
ground
and
the
rain
which
was
fast
soaking
him
through
and
through
he
was
concerned
only
to
keep
his
rifle
and
powder
dry
two
flashes
on
his
right
showed
that
the
defenders
were
already
replying
we
can
not
go
much
farther
dagaeoga
whispered
tayoga
or
we
will
be
among
them
i
shall
take
this
stump
just
ahead
and
i
the
one
beside
it
i
do
mind
admitting
that
a
thick
stump
between
you
and
your
enemy
is
a
good
thing
he
sank
down
behind
his
chosen
bulwark
and
stared
through
the
fog
the
flashes
of
fire
continued
but
they
were
on
his
right
and
left
and
nothing
appeared
directly
in
front
of
him
a
cry
came
from
a
point
farther
down
the
line
one
of
the
defenders
had
been
hit
and
presently
another
fell
robert
again
saw
all
the
dangers
and
more
but
his
mind
was
in
complete
command
of
his
body
and
he
watched
with
unfailing
vigilance
he
saw
willet
suddenly
level
his
rifle
across
his
protecting
stump
and
fire
no
cry
came
in
response
but
he
believed
that
the
hunter
bullet
had
found
its
target
tayoga
also
pulled
trigger
but
robert
did
not
yet
see
anything
at
which
to
aim
although
the
sound
of
shots
from
the
two
hostile
fronts
was
now
almost
continuous
the
combat
in
the
dim
mists
had
a
certain
weird
quality
and
imaginative
mind
heightened
its
effect
it
was
almost
like
the
blind
shooting
at
the
blind
a
pink
dot
would
appear
in
the
fog
expand
a
little
and
then
go
out
there
would
be
a
sharp
report
the
whistling
of
a
bullet
perhaps
and
that
was
all
the
white
men
fought
in
silence
and
if
there
were
any
indians
with
the
french
and
canadians
they
imitated
them
robert
at
last
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
dusky
figure
about
thirty
yards
in
front
of
him
and
aiming
his
rifle
quickly
fired
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
had
hit
save
that
no
shot
came
in
reply
but
tayoga
who
was
once
again
ear
to
the
ground
said
that
their
foes
were
drawing
back
a
little
they
find
our
fire
hotter
than
they
had
expected
he
said
if
they
can
shoot
in
the
fog
so
can
we
and
the
great
bear
is
more
than
a
match
for
them
in
such
a
contest
the
whole
line
crept
forward
and
paused
again
behind
another
row
of
stumps
a
general
volley
met
them
and
they
found
protection
none
too
soon
bullets
chipped
little
pieces
off
the
stumps
or
struck
in
the
ground
about
them
but
robert
knew
that
they
had
been
fired
largely
at
random
or
had
been
drawn
perhaps
by
a
slight
noise
there
was
a
strong
temptation
to
return
the
fire
in
a
like
manner
but
he
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
withhold
his
aim
for
the
present
and
not
shoot
until
he
had
a
sure
target
yet
the
dim
battle
in
the
fog
increased
in
volume
more
skirmishers
from
the
forces
of
luc
came
up
and
the
line
of
fire
spread
to
both
left
and
right
a
yell
was
heard
now
and
then
and
it
was
evident
that
the
indians
in
large
numbers
were
coming
into
the
combat
willet
band
was
reënforced
also
from
the
camp
and
his
line
extended
to
meet
that
of
the
foe
rifles
cracked
incessantly
the
white
fog
was
sprinkled
with
pink
dots
and
above
the
heads
of
the
men
it
was
darkened
by
the
smoke
that
rose
from
the
firing
at
rare
intervals
a
deep
cheer
from
a
borderer
replied
to
the
savage
war
whoop
a
man
four
stumps
from
robert
was
hit
in
the
head
and
died
without
a
sound
but
willet
firing
at
the
flash
of
the
rifle
that
slew
him
avenged
his
loss
a
bullet
grazed
robert
head
cutting
off
two
locks
of
hair
very
neatly
its
passage
took
his
breath
for
a
moment
or
two
and
gave
him
a
shock
but
he
recovered
quickly
and
still
controlling
his
impulse
to
pull
trigger
in
haste
looked
for
something
at
which
to
aim
the
fog
had
not
lifted
at
all
but
by
gazing
into
its
heart
a
long
time
robert
was
able
to
see
a
little
distance
now
and
then
the
figure
of
an
enemy
as
he
leaped
from
the
shelter
of
one
stump
to
another
was
outlined
dimly
but
invariably
there
was
not
enough
time
for
a
shot
soon
he
made
out
a
large
stump
not
very
far
ahead
of
him
and
he
saw
the
flash
of
a
rifle
from
it
he
caught
a
glimpse
only
of
the
hands
that
held
the
weapon
but
he
believed
them
to
be
a
white
man
hands
and
he
believed
also
that
the
man
behind
the
stump
was
one
of
the
best
french
sharpshooters
robert
resolved
to
bring
down
the
frenchman
who
presently
when
firing
once
more
might
then
expose
enough
of
himself
for
a
target
he
waited
patiently
and
the
second
shot
came
he
saw
the
hands
again
the
arms
part
of
one
shoulder
and
the
side
of
the
head
and
taking
quick
aim
he
pulled
the
trigger
though
he
was
satisfied
that
his
bullet
had
missed
but
the
flame
of
battle
was
lighted
in
robert
soul
hating
nobody
and
wishing
good
to
all
he
nevertheless
sought
to
kill
because
some
one
was
seeking
to
kill
him
and
because
killing
was
the
business
of
those
about
him
what
came
to
be
known
later
as
mass
psychology
took
hold
of
him
all
his
mental
and
physical
powers
were
concentrated
on
the
single
task
of
slaying
an
enemy
the
affair
now
resolved
itself
into
a
duel
between
single
foes
deciding
to
await
a
third
shot
from
his
enemy
he
made
his
position
behind
the
stump
a
little
easier
poised
as
it
were
ready
to
throw
every
faculty
physical
and
mental
into
his
reply
to
that
expected
third
shot
he
was
quite
sure
too
that
he
would
have
a
chance
because
the
man
had
exposed
so
much
more
of
himself
at
the
second
shot
than
at
the
first
and
his
escape
from
the
bullets
would
make
him
expose
yet
more
at
the
third
his
heart
began
to
throb
hard
and
his
pulses
were
beating
fast
the
battle
was
still
going
on
about
him
but
he
forgot
all
the
rest
of
it
the
shots
the
shouts
the
flashes
and
remembered
only
his
own
part
he
judged
that
in
another
minute
the
man
would
show
himself
so
believing
he
laid
his
rifle
across
his
stump
cocked
it
and
was
ready
to
take
aim
and
fire
in
a
few
seconds
his
foe
head
appeared
after
just
about
the
delay
that
he
had
expected
and
robert
hand
sprang
to
the
trigger
at
the
very
moment
the
man
pulled
his
own
the
bullet
hummed
by
his
cheek
his
finger
contracted
and
then
it
loosened
a
sudden
acuteness
of
vision
or
a
chance
thinning
of
the
fog
at
that
point
enabled
him
to
see
the
face
and
he
recognized
the
french
partisan
charles
langlade
known
also
to
the
indians
as
the
owl
who
with
his
wife
the
dove
had
once
held
him
in
a
captivity
by
no
means
unkind
his
humane
instincts
his
gratitude
his
feeling
for
another
flared
up
even
in
that
moment
of
battle
and
passion
when
the
impulse
was
so
strong
his
aim
quick
as
it
was
had
been
sure
and
deadly
but
deflecting
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
a
shade
his
finger
contracted
again
the
spurt
of
fire
leaped
forth
and
the
bullet
sang
by
the
ear
of
langlade
singing
to
him
a
little
song
of
caution
as
it
passed
telling
such
a
wary
partisan
as
he
that
his
stump
was
a
very
exposed
stump
dangerous
to
the
last
degree
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
find
one
somewhere
else
robert
did
not
see
the
owl
go
away
but
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
gone
because
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
such
a
skilled
forest
fighter
would
do
the
fog
thickened
again
and
in
a
few
more
minutes
both
lines
shifted
somewhat
then
he
had
to
watch
new
stumps
at
new
points
and
his
thoughts
were
once
more
in
tune
with
those
about
him
concentrated
on
the
battle
and
the
a
bullet
tipped
his
ear
and
he
saw
that
it
came
from
a
stump
hardly
visible
in
the
fog
the
sharpshooter
was
not
likely
to
be
langlade
again
and
at
once
it
became
robert
ambition
to
put
him
out
of
action
no
consideration
of
mercy
or
humanity
would
restrain
him
now
if
he
obtained
a
chance
of
a
good
shot
and
he
waited
patiently
for
it
evidently
this
new
sharpshooter
had
detected
his
presence
also
and
the
second
duel
was
on
the
man
fired
again
in
a
minute
or
two
and
the
bullet
chipped
very
close
he
was
so
quick
too
that
robert
did
not
get
an
opportunity
to
return
his
fire
but
he
recognized
the
face
and
to
his
great
surprise
saw
that
it
was
de
courcelles
who
had
taken
a
place
in
line
with
the
skirmishers
rage
seized
him
at
once
this
was
the
man
who
had
tried
to
trick
him
to
his
death
in
that
affair
with
the
bully
boucher
at
quebec
he
was
shaken
with
righteous
anger
all
the
kindliness
and
mercy
that
he
had
felt
toward
langlade
disappeared
he
was
sure
too
that
de
courcelles
knew
him
and
was
trying
his
best
to
kill
him
robert
peered
over
his
stump
and
sought
eagerly
for
a
shot
he
could
play
at
that
game
as
well
as
de
courcelles
but
his
enemy
was
cautious
it
was
some
time
before
he
risked
another
bullet
and
then
robert
in
reply
missed
though
he
also
had
been
untouched
his
anger
increased
although
he
had
little
hate
in
his
composition
he
could
not
forget
that
this
man
de
courcelles
had
been
a
party
to
an
infamous
attempt
upon
his
life
and
even
now
in
what
amounted
to
a
duel
was
seeking
to
kill
him
his
own
impulses
under
such
a
spur
and
for
the
moment
were
those
of
the
slayer
he
used
all
the
skill
that
he
had
learned
in
the
forest
to
secure
an
opportunity
for
the
taking
of
his
foe
life
robert
sought
to
draw
de
courcelles
fire
again
meanwhile
having
reloaded
his
own
rifle
and
he
raised
his
cap
a
little
above
the
edge
of
the
stump
but
the
trick
was
too
old
for
the
frenchman
and
he
did
not
yield
to
it
taking
the
chance
he
thrust
up
his
face
dropping
back
immediately
as
de
courcelles
bullet
sang
over
his
head
then
he
sprang
up
and
was
in
time
to
pull
trigger
at
his
enemy
who
fell
back
robert
was
able
to
tell
in
the
single
glimpse
through
the
fog
that
de
courcelles
was
not
killed
the
bullet
had
struck
him
in
the
shoulder
inflicting
a
wound
certainly
painful
but
probably
not
dangerous
although
it
was
likely
to
feed
the
man
hate
of
robert
even
so
young
lennox
was
glad
now
that
he
had
not
killed
him
that
his
death
was
not
upon
his
hands
it
was
enough
to
disable
him
and
to
drive
him
out
of
the
battle
the
fighting
grew
once
more
in
volume
and
fury
rifles
cracked
continuously
up
and
down
the
line
the
war
whoop
of
the
indians
was
incessant
and
the
deep
cheer
of
the
borderers
replied
to
it
but
robert
saw
that
the
end
of
the
combat
was
near
not
that
the
rage
of
man
was
abated
but
because
nature
as
if
tired
of
so
much
strife
was
putting
in
between
a
veil
that
would
hide
the
hostile
forces
from
each
other
the
fog
suddenly
began
to
thicken
rapidly
rolling
up
from
the
lake
in
great
white
waves
that
made
figures
dim
and
shadowy
even
a
few
paces
away
if
the
fighting
went
on
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
friend
from
foe
and
willet
at
once
sent
forth
a
sharp
call
which
was
repeated
up
and
down
the
line
the
french
leaders
took
like
action
and
by
mutual
consent
the
two
forces
fell
apart
the
firing
and
the
shouts
ceased
abruptly
and
a
slow
withdrawal
was
begun
the
fog
had
conquered
is
dagaeoga
hurt
asked
tayoga
untouched
replied
robert
i
saw
that
you
and
the
frenchman
de
courcelles
were
engaged
in
a
battle
of
your
own
i
might
have
helped
you
but
if
i
know
you
you
did
not
wish
my
aid
no
tayoga
it
was
man
to
man
i
confess
that
while
our
duel
was
on
i
was
filled
with
rage
against
him
and
tried
my
best
to
kill
but
now
i
glad
i
gave
him
only
a
wound
your
hate
flows
away
as
de
courcelles
blood
flows
out
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
but
do
you
hear
anything
of
the
enemy
tayoga
fog
seems
to
be
a
conductor
of
sound
now
and
then
nothing
except
the
light
noises
of
withdrawal
the
retreating
footsteps
become
fainter
and
fainter
and
i
think
we
shall
have
peace
for
they
might
fire
bullets
at
random
against
the
camp
but
luc
will
not
let
them
waste
lead
in
such
a
manner
no
dagaeoga
we
will
lie
quiet
now
and
dress
our
wounds
he
was
right
as
the
firing
was
not
renewed
though
the
pickets
stationed
at
short
intervals
kept
as
sharp
a
watch
as
they
could
in
the
fog
while
the
others
lay
by
the
fires
which
were
now
built
higher
than
usual
colden
was
hopeful
that
luc
would
draw
off
but
tayoga
and
black
rifle
who
went
out
again
into
the
fog
reported
no
sign
of
it
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
prepared
to
maintain
a
long
siege
we
must
get
help
said
willet
we
supposed
to
control
lake
george
and
we
know
that
forces
of
ours
are
at
the
south
end
where
they
advanced
since
the
taking
of
fort
william
henry
we
have
to
send
messengers
who
are
they
to
be
asked
colden
robert
and
tayoga
are
most
fit
you
have
plenty
of
boats
they
can
take
a
light
one
and
leave
at
once
while
the
fog
holds
colden
agreed
young
lennox
and
the
onondaga
were
more
than
willing
and
in
a
half
hour
everything
was
ready
for
the
start
a
strong
canoe
with
paddles
for
two
was
chosen
and
they
put
in
it
their
rifles
plenty
of
ammunition
and
some
food
a
year
from
now
if
the
war
is
still
going
on
i
be
going
with
you
on
such
errands
said
grosvenor
confidently
red
coat
speaks
the
truth
he
learns
fast
said
tayoga
i
wo
tell
you
lads
to
be
careful
because
you
do
need
any
advice
said
willet
many
were
at
the
water
edge
when
they
pushed
off
and
robert
knew
that
they
were
followed
by
the
best
of
wishes
not
only
for
their
success
but
for
themselves
also
a
few
strokes
of
the
paddles
and
the
whole
camp
save
a
luminous
glow
through
the
fog
was
gone
a
few
more
strokes
and
the
luminous
glow
too
departed
the
two
were
alone
once
more
in
the
wilderness
and
they
had
little
but
instinct
to
guide
them
in
their
perilous
journey
upon
the
waters
but
they
were
not
afraid
robert
instead
felt
a
curious
exaltation
of
the
spirit
he
was
supremely
confident
that
he
and
tayoga
would
carry
out
their
mission
in
spite
of
everything
it
is
odd
how
quickly
the
camp
sank
from
sight
he
said
it
is
because
we
are
in
the
heart
of
a
great
fog
said
tayoga
since
it
was
thick
enough
to
hide
the
battle
it
is
thick
enough
also
to
hide
the
camp
and
us
from
each
other
but
dagaeoga
it
is
a
friendly
fog
as
it
conceals
us
from
our
enemies
also
that
so
tayoga
but
i
thinking
this
fog
will
hold
dangers
for
us
too
luc
is
not
likely
to
neglect
the
lake
and
he
surmise
that
we
send
for
help
we
had
experience
on
the
water
in
fogs
before
and
you
have
to
use
your
ears
as
you
did
then
so
i
will
dagaeoga
suppose
we
stop
now
and
listen
but
nothing
of
a
hostile
nature
came
to
them
through
the
mists
and
vapors
and
resuming
the
paddles
again
they
bore
more
toward
the
center
of
the
lake
where
they
thought
they
would
be
likely
to
escape
the
cruising
canoes
of
the
enemy
if
any
should
be
sent
out
by
luc
they
expected
too
that
the
fog
would
thin
there
but
it
did
not
do
so
seeming
to
spread
over
the
full
extent
of
andiatarocte
how
long
do
you
think
the
fog
will
last
asked
robert
all
day
i
fear
replied
tayoga
that
bad
if
any
of
our
friends
should
be
on
the
shore
we
wo
be
able
to
see
but
we
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
dagaeoga
we
may
be
able
to
hear
them
the
fog
was
the
greatest
they
had
ever
seen
on
andiatarocte
seeming
to
ooze
up
from
the
depths
of
the
waters
and
to
spread
over
everything
the
keenest
eyes
like
those
of
robert
and
tayoga
could
penetrate
it
only
a
few
yards
and
it
hung
in
heavy
wet
folds
over
their
faces
it
was
difficult
even
to
tell
direction
and
they
paddled
very
slowly
in
a
direction
that
they
surmised
led
to
the
south
after
a
while
they
stopped
again
that
tayoga
might
establish
a
new
listening
post
upon
the
water
though
nothing
alarming
yet
came
to
those
marvelous
ears
of
his
but
it
was
evident
that
he
expected
peril
and
robert
also
anticipated
it
a
force
as
large
as
luc
is
sure
to
have
brought
canoes
overland
said
young
lennox
and
in
a
fog
like
this
he
have
them
launched
on
the
lake
it
is
so
said
tayoga
using
his
favorite
expression
and
i
think
they
will
come
soon
they
moved
on
once
more
a
few
hundred
yards
and
then
when
the
onondaga
listened
a
long
time
he
announced
that
the
hostile
canoes
were
on
the
lake
cruising
about
in
the
fog
i
hear
one
to
the
right
of
us
another
to
the
left
and
several
directly
ahead
he
said
sharp
sword
brought
plenty
of
canoes
with
him
and
he
is
using
them
i
think
they
have
formed
a
line
across
the
lake
surmising
that
we
would
send
a
message
to
the
south
sharp
sword
is
a
great
leader
and
he
forgets
nothing
they
ca
draw
a
line
that
we
wo
pass
now
they
began
to
use
their
paddles
very
slowly
and
gently
the
canoe
barely
creeping
along
and
tayoga
listening
with
all
his
powers
but
the
onondaga
was
aware
that
his
were
not
the
only
keen
ears
on
the
lake
and
that
gentle
as
was
the
movement
of
the
paddies
that
he
and
robert
held
it
might
be
heard
the
canoe
on
our
right
is
coming
in
a
little
closer
to
us
he
whispered
it
is
a
very
large
canoe
because
it
holds
four
paddles
i
can
trace
the
four
separate
sounds
they
try
to
soften
their
strokes
lest
the
hidden
messenger
whom
they
want
to
catch
may
hear
them
but
they
can
not
destroy
the
sound
altogether
now
the
one
on
the
left
is
bearing
in
toward
us
also
i
think
they
have
made
a
chain
across
the
lake
and
hope
to
keep
anything
from
passing
can
you
hear
those
ahead
of
us
very
slightly
and
only
now
and
then
but
it
is
enough
to
tell
us
that
they
are
still
there
but
dagaeoga
we
must
go
ahead
even
if
they
are
before
us
we
can
not
think
of
turning
back
no
such
thought
entered
my
head
tayoga
we
run
this
gauntlet
that
was
what
i
knew
you
would
say
the
canoes
from
both
right
and
left
still
approach
i
think
they
carry
on
a
patrol
in
the
fog
and
move
back
and
forth
always
keeping
in
touch
now
we
must
go
forward
a
little
or
they
will
be
upon
us
but
be
ever
so
gentle
with
the
paddle
dagaeoga
that
is
it
we
make
so
little
sound
that
it
is
no
sound
at
all
and
they
can
not
hear
us
now
we
are
well
beyond
them
and
the
two
canoes
are
meeting
in
the
fog
the
men
in
them
talk
together
you
hear
them
very
well
yourself
dagaeoga
their
exact
words
do
not
come
to
our
ears
but
we
know
they
are
telling
one
another
that
no
messenger
from
the
beleaguered
camp
has
yet
passed
now
they
part
and
go
back
on
their
beat
we
can
afford
to
forget
them
dagaeoga
and
think
of
those
ahead
we
still
have
the
real
gauntlet
to
run
be
very
gentle
with
the
paddle
again
i
hear
the
canoes
ahead
of
us
very
clearly
now
one
of
them
is
large
also
with
four
paddles
in
it
and
two
of
the
men
are
frenchmen
i
can
not
understand
what
they
say
but
i
hear
the
french
accent
the
sound
is
not
at
all
like
that
the
warriors
make
one
of
the
frenchmen
is
giving
instructions
as
i
can
tell
by
his
tone
of
command
and
i
think
the
canoes
are
going
to
spread
out
more
yes
they
are
moving
away
to
both
right
and
left
they
must
feel
sure
that
we
are
here
somewhere
in
the
fog
trying
to
get
by
them
but
the
big
canoe
with
the
frenchmen
in
it
keeps
its
place
bear
a
little
to
the
left
dagaeoga
and
we
can
pass
it
unseen
it
was
the
most
delicate
of
tasks
to
paddle
the
canoe
and
cause
scarcely
a
ripple
in
the
water
but
they
were
so
skillful
they
were
able
to
do
it
and
make
no
sound
that
robert
himself
could
hear
although
his
nerves
were
steady
his
excitement
was
intense
a
situation
so
extraordinary
put
every
power
of
his
imagination
into
play
his
fancy
fairly
peopled
the
water
with
hostile
canoes
they
were
in
a
triple
ring
about
him
and
tayoga
all
his
pulses
were
beating
hard
yet
his
will
as
usual
was
master
of
his
nerves
and
the
hand
that
held
the
paddle
never
shook
a
canoe
on
the
outer
line
and
from
the
left
is
now
bearing
in
toward
us
whispered
tayoga
there
are
two
men
in
it
as
the
strokes
of
the
paddles
show
they
are
coming
toward
us
some
evil
spirit
must
have
whispered
to
them
that
we
are
here
ah
they
have
stopped
what
does
it
mean
dagaeoga
listen
did
you
not
hear
a
little
splash
they
think
to
surprise
us
they
keep
the
paddles
silent
and
try
a
new
trick
hold
the
canoe
here
dagaeoga
and
i
will
meet
the
warrior
who
comes
the
onondaga
dropped
his
rifle
hunting
shirt
and
belt
with
his
pistol
in
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
then
his
knife
in
his
teeth
he
was
over
the
side
so
quickly
that
robert
did
not
have
time
to
protest
in
an
instant
he
was
gone
in
the
fog
and
the
youth
in
the
canoe
could
do
nothing
but
wait
a
prey
to
the
most
terrible
apprehensions
robert
with
an
occasional
motion
of
the
paddle
held
the
canoe
steady
on
the
water
and
tried
to
pierce
the
fog
with
his
eyes
he
knew
that
he
must
stay
just
where
he
was
or
tayoga
when
he
came
back
might
never
find
him
if
he
came
back
if
he
listened
with
all
his
ears
for
some
sound
however
slight
that
might
tell
him
what
was
happening
out
of
the
fog
came
a
faint
splash
and
then
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
young
lennox
shuddered
and
the
hair
on
his
head
stood
up
a
little
he
knew
that
sound
was
made
by
a
soul
passing
but
whose
soul
once
more
he
realized
to
the
full
that
his
lot
was
cast
in
wild
and
perilous
places
a
swimming
face
appeared
in
the
fog
close
to
the
canoe
and
then
his
heart
fell
from
his
throat
to
its
usual
place
tayoga
climbed
lightly
into
the
canoe
no
easy
feat
in
such
a
situation
put
on
his
belt
and
replaced
the
knife
in
the
sheath
robert
asked
him
nothing
he
had
no
need
to
do
so
the
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
had
told
the
full
tale
now
we
will
bear
to
the
right
again
dagaeoga
said
tayoga
calmly
as
the
water
dripped
from
him
robert
shivered
once
more
his
fertile
fancy
reproduced
that
brief
fierce
struggle
in
the
water
but
he
said
nothing
promptly
following
the
suggestion
of
tayoga
and
sending
the
canoe
to
the
right
the
position
was
too
perilous
though
for
them
to
continue
on
one
course
long
and
at
the
end
of
forty
or
fifty
yards
they
stopped
both
listening
intently
some
of
them
are
talking
with
one
another
now
whispered
tayoga
the
warrior
who
swam
does
not
come
back
to
his
canoe
and
they
wonder
why
he
stays
in
the
water
so
long
soon
they
will
know
that
he
is
never
coming
out
of
the
water
now
i
hear
a
voice
raised
somewhat
above
the
others
it
is
a
french
voice
it
is
not
that
of
luc
because
he
must
remain
on
shore
to
direct
his
army
it
is
not
that
of
de
courcelles
because
you
wounded
him
and
he
must
be
lying
in
camp
nursing
his
hurts
so
i
conclude
that
it
is
jumonville
who
is
next
in
rank
and
who
therefore
would
be
likely
to
command
on
this
important
service
i
am
sure
it
is
jumonville
and
his
raised
voice
indicates
that
he
is
giving
orders
he
realizes
that
the
swimmer
will
not
return
and
that
we
must
be
near
perhaps
he
knows
or
guesses
that
the
messengers
are
you
and
i
because
he
has
learned
long
since
that
we
are
fitted
for
just
such
service
and
that
we
have
done
such
deeds
for
instance
our
journey
to
quebec
on
which
we
first
met
him
then
he
think
dave
is
here
too
because
he
was
with
us
then
no
he
will
be
quite
sure
the
great
bear
is
not
here
he
knows
that
he
is
too
important
in
the
defense
of
the
camp
that
while
captain
colden
commands
it
is
the
great
bear
who
suggests
and
really
directs
everything
his
sharp
orders
signify
some
sudden
new
plan
they
have
a
fleet
of
canoes
and
i
think
they
are
making
a
chain
with
the
links
connected
so
closely
that
we
can
not
pass
it
is
a
real
gauntlet
for
us
to
run
dagaeoga
and
how
are
we
to
run
it
we
must
pass
as
warriors
as
men
of
their
own
i
do
not
look
like
a
warrior
but
you
can
make
yourself
look
like
one
in
the
fog
at
least
enough
perhaps
to
go
by
your
hair
is
a
little
long
take
off
your
hunting
shirt
and
the
other
shirt
beneath
it
bare
yourself
to
the
waist
and
in
such
a
fog
as
this
it
would
take
the
keenest
of
eyes
only
a
few
yards
away
to
tell
that
you
are
white
quick
dagaeoga
lay
the
garments
on
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
bend
well
upon
your
paddle
and
appear
to
be
searching
the
water
everywhere
for
the
messengers
who
try
to
escape
i
will
do
the
same
ah
that
is
well
you
look
and
act
so
much
like
a
warrior
of
the
woods
dagaeoga
that
even
i
in
the
same
canoe
could
well
take
you
for
a
huron
now
we
will
whisper
no
more
for
a
while
because
they
come
and
they
will
soon
be
upon
us
robert
bent
over
his
paddle
his
upper
clothing
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
with
his
rifle
and
tayoga
upon
the
garments
ready
to
be
snatched
up
in
an
instant
if
need
should
come
the
cold
wet
fog
beat
upon
his
bare
shoulders
and
chest
but
he
did
not
feel
it
instead
his
blood
was
hot
in
every
vein
and
the
great
pulses
in
his
temples
beat
so
hard
that
they
made
a
roaring
in
his
ears
distinct
sounds
now
came
from
both
left
and
right
the
swish
of
paddles
the
ripple
of
water
against
the
side
of
a
canoe
men
talking
they
were
coming
to
the
chain
that
had
been
stretched
in
front
of
them
and
their
fate
would
soon
be
decided
now
they
must
be
not
only
brave
to
the
uttermost
but
they
must
be
consummate
actors
too
figures
began
to
form
themselves
in
the
fog
the
outline
of
a
canoe
with
two
men
in
it
appeared
on
their
right
another
showed
just
ahead
and
two
more
on
the
left
robert
from
his
lowered
eyes
bent
over
the
paddle
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
one
ahead
a
great
canoe
or
rather
boat
containing
five
men
one
of
whom
wielded
no
paddle
but
who
sat
in
its
center
issuing
orders
through
the
fog
came
a
slight
gleam
of
metal
from
his
epaulets
and
belt
and
although
the
face
was
indistinct
robert
knew
that
it
was
jumonville
the
officer
was
telling
the
canoes
to
keep
close
watch
not
to
let
the
chain
be
broken
that
the
messengers
were
close
at
hand
that
they
would
soon
be
taken
and
that
their
comrade
who
did
not
come
back
would
be
avenged
robert
bent
a
little
lower
over
his
paddle
his
whole
body
prickled
and
the
roaring
in
his
ears
increased
tayoga
suddenly
struck
him
a
smart
blow
across
his
bowed
back
and
spoke
to
him
fiercely
in
harsh
guttural
huron
robert
did
not
understand
the
words
but
they
sounded
like
a
stern
rebuke
for
poor
work
with
the
paddle
the
blow
and
the
words
stimulated
him
keyed
him
to
a
supreme
effort
as
an
actor
all
his
histrionic
temperament
flared
up
at
once
he
made
a
poor
stroke
with
the
paddle
threw
up
much
surplus
water
and
as
he
cowered
away
from
tayoga
he
corrected
himself
hastily
tayoga
uttered
a
sharp
rebuke
again
but
did
not
strike
a
second
time
that
would
have
been
too
much
robert
next
stroke
was
fine
and
sweeping
and
he
heard
jumonville
say
in
french
which
many
of
the
indians
understood
go
more
toward
the
center
of
the
lake
and
take
a
place
in
the
line
tayoga
and
robert
obeyed
dumbly
passing
jumonville
boat
at
a
range
of
five
or
six
yards
going
a
little
beyond
the
line
and
turning
about
as
if
to
make
a
curve
that
would
keep
them
from
striking
any
other
canoe
again
robert
made
a
false
stroke
with
the
paddle
causing
the
canoe
to
rock
dangerously
and
now
tayoga
fully
justified
by
the
fierce
code
of
the
forest
in
striking
him
again
snatched
his
own
paddle
out
of
the
water
and
gave
him
a
smart
rap
with
the
flat
of
it
across
the
back
at
the
same
time
upbraiding
him
fiercely
in
huron
dolt
fool
he
exclaimed
will
you
never
learn
how
to
hold
your
paddle
will
you
never
know
the
stroke
will
you
tip
us
both
into
the
water
at
such
a
time
when
the
messengers
of
the
enemy
are
seeking
to
steal
through
do
better
with
the
paddle
or
you
shall
stay
at
home
with
the
old
women
and
work
for
the
warriors
robert
snarled
in
reply
but
he
did
not
repay
the
blow
he
made
another
awkward
sweep
that
sent
them
farther
on
the
outward
curve
and
he
heard
jumonville
harsh
laugh
he
was
still
the
superb
actor
his
excitement
was
real
and
he
counterfeited
a
nervousness
and
jerkiness
that
appeared
real
also
one
more
wild
stroke
and
they
shot
farther
out
jumonville
angrily
ordered
them
to
return
but
robert
seemed
to
be
possessed
by
a
spell
of
awkwardness
and
tayoga
craftily
aided
him
come
back
roared
jumonville
robert
and
tayoga
were
fifteen
yards
away
and
the
great
blanket
of
fog
was
enclosing
them
now
now
dagaeoga
whispered
the
onondaga
tensely
we
paddle
with
all
our
might
straight
toward
the
south
two
paddles
wielded
by
skillful
and
powerful
arms
flashed
in
the
water
and
the
canoe
sped
on
its
way
a
shout
of
anger
rose
behind
them
and
robert
distinctly
heard
jumonville
say
in
french
after
them
after
them
it
was
the
messengers
who
stole
by
they
have
tricked
us
those
words
were
sweet
in
the
ears
of
young
lennox
he
had
played
the
actor
and
the
reward
the
saving
of
their
lives
had
been
paid
it
was
one
of
their
greatest
triumphs
and
the
savor
of
it
would
endure
long
the
very
thought
gave
fresh
power
to
his
arm
and
back
and
he
swept
his
paddle
with
a
strength
that
he
had
never
known
before
the
canoe
skimmed
the
water
like
a
bird
and
fairly
flew
in
their
chosen
course
robert
own
faculties
became
marvelously
acute
he
heard
behind
them
the
repeated
and
angry
orders
of
jumonville
the
hurried
strokes
of
many
paddles
the
splashing
of
canoes
turned
quickly
about
a
hum
of
excited
voices
and
then
he
felt
a
great
swell
of
confidence
the
roaring
in
his
ears
was
gone
his
nerves
became
amazingly
steady
and
every
stroke
with
his
paddle
was
long
and
finished
a
work
of
art
four
or
five
minutes
of
such
toil
and
tayoga
rested
on
his
paddle
robert
imitated
him
now
we
will
take
our
ease
and
listen
said
the
onondaga
the
fog
is
still
our
friend
and
they
will
think
we
have
turned
to
one
side
in
it
because
that
is
the
natural
thing
to
do
but
you
and
i
dagaeoga
will
not
turn
just
yet
i
ca
hear
anything
tayoga
can
you
i
can
not
dagaeoga
but
we
will
not
have
long
to
wait
now
i
catch
the
light
swish
of
a
paddle
they
are
feeling
about
in
the
fog
there
goes
another
paddle
and
more
they
come
closer
but
we
still
bide
here
a
little
i
hear
the
voice
of
jumonville
he
is
very
angry
but
why
should
he
be
more
angry
at
any
other
than
at
himself
he
saw
us
with
his
own
eyes
he
shouts
many
sharp
orders
and
some
of
them
are
foolish
they
must
be
so
because
no
man
could
shout
orders
so
fast
and
in
such
a
confused
way
and
have
them
all
good
he
sends
more
canoes
to
both
right
and
left
to
seek
us
you
and
i
can
afford
to
laugh
dagaeoga
sitting
at
rest
in
their
canoe
they
laughed
with
robert
it
was
not
so
much
a
laugh
of
amusement
as
a
laugh
of
relief
after
such
tremendous
tension
he
felt
that
they
were
now
sure
to
escape
and
with
tayoga
he
waited
calmly
chapter
xi
the
happy
escape
the
spirits
of
young
lennox
rose
to
the
zenith
although
they
were
still
grazing
the
edge
of
peril
he
had
supreme
confidence
in
tayoga
and
also
in
the
fog
it
was
a
great
fog
a
thick
fog
a
kindly
fog
and
it
had
made
possible
their
escape
and
the
achievement
of
their
mission
having
held
so
long
it
would
hold
until
they
needed
it
no
longer
have
they
come
any
nearer
tayoga
he
asked
jumonville
is
still
giving
orders
and
sending
the
canoes
somewhat
at
random
he
is
not
the
leader
sharp
sword
would
be
in
an
emergency
nor
anything
like
it
he
is
having
his
own
boat
paddled
about
uncertainly
i
can
hear
the
paddles
of
the
four
men
in
it
now
and
then
he
speaks
angrily
too
he
is
upbraiding
those
who
are
not
to
blame
how
are
you
feeling
now
dagaeoga
has
manitou
already
filled
you
with
new
strength
i
feeling
as
well
as
i
ever
did
in
my
life
i
ready
to
swing
the
paddle
again
then
we
go
the
fog
will
not
wait
for
us
forever
we
must
use
it
while
we
have
it
they
swept
their
paddles
through
the
water
in
long
and
vigorous
strokes
and
the
canoe
shot
forward
once
more
they
were
confident
now
that
no
enemy
was
ahead
of
them
and
that
none
of
those
behind
could
overtake
them
the
wet
cold
fog
still
enclosed
them
like
a
heavy
damp
blanket
but
their
vigorous
exercise
and
their
high
spirits
kept
them
warm
after
ten
minutes
they
made
another
stop
but
as
tayoga
could
hear
nothing
of
jumonville
party
they
pushed
on
again
at
speed
by
and
by
the
onondaga
said
i
feel
the
fog
thinning
dagaeoga
a
wind
out
of
the
west
has
risen
and
soon
it
will
take
it
all
away
but
it
has
served
its
purpose
i
shall
always
feel
well
toward
fogs
yes
here
it
goes
the
wind
is
rising
fast
and
it
is
taking
away
the
mists
and
vapors
in
great
folds
the
water
began
to
roughen
under
the
stiff
breeze
the
fog
was
split
asunder
the
pieces
were
torn
to
fragments
and
shreds
and
then
everything
was
swept
away
leaving
the
surface
of
the
lake
a
silver
mirror
and
the
mountains
high
and
green
on
either
shore
far
behind
them
hovered
the
indian
canoes
and
four
or
five
miles
ahead
a
tower
of
smoke
rose
from
the
west
bank
certainly
our
people
said
robert
looking
at
the
smoke
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
said
the
onondaga
and
that
is
where
we
will
go
and
those
behind
us
know
now
that
we
tricked
them
in
the
fog
and
have
escaped
they
give
forth
a
shout
of
anger
and
disappointment
now
they
turn
back
they
eased
their
strokes
a
little
as
the
pursuit
had
been
abandoned
but
curved
more
toward
the
center
of
the
lake
lest
some
hidden
sharpshooter
on
shore
might
reach
them
and
made
fair
speed
toward
the
smoke
which
robert
surmised
might
be
made
by
a
vanguard
of
troops
we
ought
to
have
help
for
colden
and
willet
very
soon
he
said
it
will
not
be
long
said
tayoga
but
dagaeoga
has
forgotten
something
can
he
not
think
what
it
is
no
tayoga
i
ca
recall
anything
dagaeoga
body
is
bare
from
the
waist
up
it
is
well
for
an
indian
to
go
thus
into
a
white
camp
but
it
is
not
the
custom
of
the
people
to
whom
lennox
belongs
you
right
i
had
so
much
excitement
that
i
forgotten
all
about
my
clothes
i
must
be
true
to
my
race
when
i
meet
my
brethren
he
reclothed
himself
resumed
his
paddle
and
they
pushed
on
steadily
for
the
smoke
no
trace
of
the
fog
was
left
the
lake
glistened
in
the
sun
the
ranges
showed
green
from
base
to
summit
and
the
tower
of
smoke
deepened
and
broadened
can
you
make
out
what
lies
at
the
foot
of
it
tayoga
asked
robert
i
think
i
can
see
a
gleam
of
the
sun
on
an
epaulet
it
is
certainly
a
camp
of
your
people
the
lake
is
supposed
to
be
under
their
command
and
if
the
french
should
make
a
new
incursion
here
upon
its
shores
they
would
not
build
their
fires
so
boldly
now
i
see
another
gleam
and
i
hear
the
ring
of
axes
they
are
not
boat
builders
because
no
boats
either
finished
or
unfinished
show
at
the
water
edge
they
are
probably
cutting
wood
for
their
fires
i
hear
too
the
crack
of
a
whip
which
means
that
they
have
wagons
and
the
presence
of
wagons
indicates
a
large
force
they
may
be
coming
ahead
with
supplies
for
our
great
army
when
it
advances
i
can
now
see
men
in
uniform
and
there
are
some
red
coats
among
them
hold
your
paddle
as
high
as
you
can
dagaeoga
as
a
sign
that
we
are
friends
and
i
will
send
the
canoe
in
toward
the
shore
ah
they
see
us
now
and
men
are
coming
down
to
the
lake
edge
to
meet
us
it
is
a
large
camp
and
it
should
hold
enough
men
to
make
luc
give
up
the
siege
of
colden
the
two
sent
the
canoe
swiftly
toward
the
land
where
soldiers
and
others
in
hunter
dress
were
already
gathered
to
meet
them
robert
saw
a
tall
thin
officer
in
a
colonial
uniform
standing
on
the
narrow
beach
and
assuming
him
to
be
in
command
he
said
as
the
canoe
swept
in
we
are
messengers
sir
from
the
force
of
captain
colden
which
is
besieged
at
the
sawmill
ten
or
twelve
miles
farther
north
besieged
did
you
say
said
the
officer
speaking
in
a
sharp
dry
voice
it
one
of
those
french
tricks
they
always
playing
on
us
rushing
in
under
our
very
noses
and
trying
to
cut
out
our
forces
that
it
sir
the
french
and
indian
host
in
this
case
is
led
by
luc
the
ablest
and
most
daring
of
all
their
partisans
and
unless
you
give
help
they
have
to
escape
as
best
they
can
in
what
boats
they
have
as
i
a
good
massachusetts
man
i
expected
something
of
this
kind
i
sent
word
to
pownall
our
governor
that
we
must
be
extremely
cautious
in
respect
to
the
french
but
he
thinks
the
army
of
general
abercrombie
will
overwhelm
everything
forest
fighting
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
open
fields
a
fact
which
the
french
seem
to
have
mastered
better
than
we
have
my
name
young
sir
is
elihu
strong
i
a
colonel
of
the
massachusetts
militia
and
i
command
the
force
that
you
see
posted
here
and
mine
sir
is
robert
lennox
a
free
lance
and
this
is
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
great
onondaga
nation
a
devoted
friend
of
ours
and
the
finest
trailer
the
world
has
ever
produced
ah
i
heard
something
of
you
both
when
i
was
at
albany
from
one
jacobus
huysman
a
stout
and
worthy
burgher
who
spoke
well
of
you
and
who
hazarded
a
surmise
that
i
might
meet
you
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
lakes
we
lived
in
the
house
of
mynheer
jacobus
when
we
went
to
school
in
albany
we
owe
him
much
there
was
a
third
who
was
generally
with
you
a
famous
hunter
david
willet
was
there
not
he
is
with
captain
colden
sir
assisting
in
the
defense
i
glad
he
there
judging
from
what
i
heard
of
him
he
a
tower
of
strength
but
come
into
the
camp
doubtless
both
of
you
need
food
and
rest
the
times
be
dark
and
we
must
get
out
of
each
day
whatever
it
has
to
offer
robert
looked
at
him
with
interest
he
was
the
forerunner
of
a
type
that
was
to
develop
markedly
in
new
england
tall
thin
critical
shrewd
and
tenacious
to
the
last
degree
he
and
his
kind
were
destined
to
make
a
great
impress
upon
the
new
world
he
gave
to
the
two
the
best
the
camp
had
and
ordered
that
they
be
treated
with
every
courtesy
i
a
strong
force
here
he
said
although
it
might
have
been
stronger
if
our
governor
and
legislature
had
done
their
full
duty
still
we
must
make
the
best
of
everything
my
men
reported
indians
in
the
forest
to
the
north
of
us
and
that
perhaps
is
the
reason
why
we
have
not
come
into
contact
with
captain
colden
but
i
did
not
suspect
that
he
was
besieged
robert
as
he
ate
the
good
food
set
before
him
looked
over
the
camp
which
had
been
pitched
well
with
pickets
to
guard
against
ambush
and
his
eyes
glistened
as
they
fell
upon
two
brass
cannon
standing
side
by
side
upon
a
slight
rise
in
the
center
of
the
camp
the
big
guns
when
well
handled
were
always
effective
against
forest
warriors
colonel
strong
eyes
followed
his
i
see
that
you
are
taking
notice
of
my
cannon
he
said
good
pieces
but
if
our
governor
and
legislature
had
done
their
duty
they
be
four
instead
of
two
still
we
have
to
make
the
best
of
what
we
have
i
told
shirley
that
we
must
prepare
for
a
great
war
and
i
tell
pownall
the
same
those
who
do
know
him
always
underrate
our
french
foe
i
never
do
sir
said
robert
i
seen
too
much
of
him
to
do
that
well
well
we
do
the
best
we
can
i
four
hundred
men
here
though
if
the
governor
and
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
had
done
their
full
duty
they
be
eight
hundred
not
to
say
a
thousand
advance
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
relief
of
colden
he
can
surely
hold
out
until
the
morrow
not
a
doubt
of
it
sir
and
if
you
pardon
me
for
making
a
suggestion
i
would
begin
any
advance
until
the
morning
not
much
of
the
day
is
left
if
we
started
this
afternoon
night
would
overtake
us
in
the
woods
and
the
chevalier
de
luc
is
sure
to
plant
an
ambush
for
us
sensibly
spoken
young
sir
we
an
eternally
rash
people
always
walking
into
traps
i
in
my
force
about
twenty
good
scouts
though
if
the
governor
and
legislature
of
massachusetts
had
done
their
full
duty
they
be
forty
not
to
say
fifty
and
i
do
want
to
risk
their
loss
in
night
fighting
in
the
forest
he
went
away
and
robert
saw
him
moving
among
his
men
giving
orders
elihu
strong
a
merchant
nevertheless
had
made
himself
a
strenuous
soldier
at
his
province
call
and
he
was
not
unwilling
to
learn
even
from
those
not
more
than
half
his
age
open
eyes
will
do
well
said
tayoga
open
eyes
aye
dagaeoga
the
colonel
who
is
named
strong
i
will
call
open
eyes
because
he
is
willing
to
look
and
see
he
will
look
when
you
tell
him
to
look
and
many
who
come
from
the
cities
will
not
do
that
and
because
his
eyes
are
open
he
will
not
stick
his
head
into
an
ambush
yet
he
will
always
complain
of
others
and
sometimes
of
himself
too
laughed
robert
i
think
he
be
fair
in
that
respect
now
tayoga
we
rest
here
and
be
easy
with
ourselves
until
morning
when
we
advance
we
will
stay
dagaeoga
but
i
do
not
know
whether
it
will
be
so
easy
since
jumonville
saw
us
escape
he
will
tell
luc
of
it
and
sharp
sword
will
send
a
force
here
to
harry
open
eyes
and
to
make
him
think
the
forest
is
full
of
warriors
but
open
eyes
though
he
may
complain
will
not
be
afraid
it
was
even
as
the
onondaga
predicted
the
foe
came
with
the
twilight
the
dark
wilderness
about
them
gave
back
whoops
and
yells
and
furtive
bands
skirmished
with
strong
scouts
then
the
shouts
of
the
warriors
increased
greatly
in
number
and
seemed
to
come
from
all
points
about
the
camp
it
was
obvious
to
robert
that
the
enemy
was
trying
to
make
strong
men
believe
that
a
great
force
was
confronting
them
and
some
of
them
unused
to
the
woods
showed
apprehension
lest
such
an
unseen
and
elusive
danger
overwhelm
them
but
elihu
strong
never
flinched
the
forest
was
almost
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
him
as
it
was
to
his
troops
but
he
was
there
to
dare
its
perils
and
he
dared
them
i
shall
keep
my
men
in
camp
and
await
attack
if
they
make
it
he
said
to
robert
to
whom
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
and
whatever
happens
i
shall
move
forward
in
the
morning
to
the
relief
of
colden
he
shut
his
thin
lips
tightly
together
and
his
pale
blue
eyes
flashed
the
merchant
turned
soldier
had
the
stoutest
of
hearts
and
a
stout
heart
was
what
was
needed
in
his
camp
that
night
the
warriors
gave
his
men
no
rest
they
circled
about
continually
firing
and
whooping
and
trying
to
create
panic
or
at
least
a
fear
that
would
hold
strong
where
he
was
robert
went
to
sleep
early
and
when
he
awakened
far
in
the
night
the
turmoil
was
still
going
on
but
he
saw
elihu
strong
walking
back
and
forth
near
one
of
the
fires
and
in
the
glow
his
thin
face
still
reflected
an
iron
resolution
satisfied
that
the
camp
was
in
no
danger
of
being
frightened
young
lennox
went
back
to
sleep
a
gray
chilly
morning
came
and
soon
after
dawn
elihu
strong
began
to
prepare
his
men
for
their
perilous
progress
serving
first
an
ample
hot
breakfast
with
plenty
of
tea
and
coffee
open
eyes
not
only
watches
but
he
knows
much
said
tayoga
he
has
learned
that
an
army
marches
better
on
a
full
stomach
strong
then
asked
robert
and
tayoga
to
serve
in
a
way
as
guides
and
he
made
his
dispositions
sending
his
scouts
in
advance
putting
his
most
experienced
soldiers
on
the
flanks
and
heading
his
main
column
with
the
two
brass
cannon
the
strictest
injunctions
that
nobody
straggle
were
given
and
then
the
force
took
up
its
march
they
had
not
been
molested
while
at
breakfast
and
when
making
the
preparations
but
as
soon
as
they
left
the
fire
and
entered
the
deep
forest
the
terrifying
turmoil
burst
forth
again
fierce
whoops
resounding
on
every
side
and
bullets
pattering
on
the
leaves
or
bark
colonel
strong
left
his
scouts
and
flankers
to
deal
with
the
ambushed
warriors
and
the
main
column
face
to
the
front
marched
steadily
toward
colden
camp
it
was
to
be
a
trial
of
nerves
and
robert
was
quite
confident
that
the
stern
new
england
leader
would
win
the
savages
make
a
tremendous
tumult
he
said
to
young
lennox
but
their
bullets
are
not
reaching
us
we
not
to
be
shaken
by
mere
noise
when
they
find
that
out
as
they
soon
will
said
robert
make
an
attack
some
french
officers
and
troops
must
be
with
them
perhaps
jumonville
came
in
the
night
to
lead
them
he
and
tayoga
then
went
a
short
distance
into
the
forest
ahead
of
the
scouts
and
tayoga
saw
ample
evidence
that
the
french
were
present
with
the
indians
you
are
right
in
your
surmise
that
jumonville
came
in
the
night
he
said
he
wore
boots
and
here
are
the
imprints
of
his
heels
i
think
he
is
not
far
away
now
watch
well
dagaeoga
while
i
lie
on
the
earth
and
listen
ear
to
the
ground
the
onondaga
announced
that
he
could
hear
men
on
both
sides
of
them
moving
there
is
the
light
step
of
the
warriors
he
said
and
also
the
heavier
tread
of
the
french
i
think
i
can
hear
jumonville
himself
it
sounds
like
the
crush
of
boots
perhaps
they
are
now
seeking
to
lay
an
ambush
then
it
time
for
us
to
fall
back
tayoga
both
for
our
own
sakes
and
for
the
sake
of
colonel
strong
force
the
two
retreated
quickly
lest
they
be
caught
in
an
ambush
and
gave
warning
to
elihu
strong
that
an
attack
was
now
probable
a
belief
in
which
they
were
confirmed
by
the
report
the
scouts
brought
in
presently
that
a
creek
was
just
ahead
a
crossing
always
being
a
favorite
place
for
an
indian
trap
so
be
it
said
colonel
strong
calmly
we
are
ready
if
the
governor
and
legislature
of
massachusetts
had
done
their
full
duty
we
be
twice
as
strong
but
even
as
we
are
we
force
the
passage
of
the
creek
you
will
find
a
body
of
the
warriors
on
this
side
of
the
stream
said
tayoga
they
will
give
way
after
a
little
firing
tempting
you
to
think
you
have
won
an
easy
victory
then
when
about
half
of
your
men
are
across
they
will
attack
with
all
their
might
hoping
to
cut
you
down
i
thank
you
for
telling
me
said
colonel
strong
i
no
doubt
you
know
what
you
talking
about
your
manner
indicates
it
we
might
be
much
better
equipped
than
we
are
if
those
in
authority
in
my
province
had
done
their
full
duty
but
we
will
make
way
nevertheless
cover
the
passage
of
the
creek
with
the
guns
the
firing
in
front
already
showed
that
tayoga
prediction
was
coming
true
and
it
was
accompanied
by
a
tremendous
volume
of
yelling
as
if
the
whole
indian
force
were
gathered
on
the
near
side
of
the
creek
robert
from
the
crest
of
a
hill
saw
the
stream
narrow
and
deep
though
not
too
deep
for
fording
as
he
was
to
learn
later
fringed
on
either
side
with
a
dense
growth
of
low
bushes
from
the
shelter
of
which
warriors
were
sending
their
bullets
toward
the
white
force
the
men
were
eager
to
go
against
them
at
once
but
the
scouts
were
sent
forward
through
the
undergrowth
to
open
up
a
flanking
fire
and
then
the
main
column
marched
on
at
a
steady
pace
the
crash
of
the
rifles
grew
fast
the
warriors
on
the
near
side
of
the
creek
leaped
from
the
bushes
as
strong
men
drew
near
waded
the
stream
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
on
the
other
bank
giving
forth
howls
of
disappointment
as
they
fled
the
soldiers
uttering
a
shout
of
triumph
undertook
to
rush
forward
in
pursuit
but
strong
restrained
them
it
the
ambush
against
which
the
onondaga
warned
us
he
said
to
his
lieutenants
and
we
wo
run
into
it
bring
forward
the
cannon
the
two
brass
guns
fine
twelve
pounders
were
moved
up
within
close
range
of
the
creek
and
they
swept
the
forest
on
the
other
side
with
balls
and
grape
shot
it
was
probably
the
first
time
cannon
were
ever
heard
in
those
woods
and
the
reports
came
back
in
many
echoes
boughs
and
twigs
rained
down
it
is
a
great
sound
said
tayoga
admiringly
and
the
warriors
who
are
trying
to
plant
an
ambush
will
not
like
it
but
you
remember
braddock
fate
said
robert
the
cannon
do
much
then
but
this
is
different
dagaeoga
open
eyes
has
his
eyes
open
he
is
merely
using
the
cannon
as
a
cover
for
his
advance
they
will
be
backed
up
by
the
rifles
you
will
see
the
soldiers
approached
the
creek
cautiously
and
when
the
first
ranks
were
in
the
water
the
cannon
raked
the
woods
ahead
to
right
and
left
and
to
left
and
right
the
best
of
the
riflemen
were
also
pushed
forward
and
when
the
warriors
opened
fire
they
were
quickly
driven
away
then
the
whole
force
carrying
the
cannon
with
them
crossed
and
stood
in
triumph
on
the
other
side
did
i
not
tell
you
that
open
eyes
knew
what
he
was
doing
said
tayoga
it
seems
that
he
does
robert
replied
but
we
have
yet
arrived
at
colden
station
an
attack
in
force
is
sure
to
come
dagaeoga
speaks
truth
i
think
it
will
occur
a
mile
or
two
farther
on
they
will
make
it
before
captain
colden
men
can
learn
that
we
are
on
the
march
then
they
wo
wait
long
anywhere
will
do
as
the
forest
is
dense
everywhere
since
they
had
carried
the
ford
with
but
little
loss
the
cannon
that
had
blazed
the
way
ceased
to
fire
but
the
gunners
regarded
them
proudly
and
robert
did
not
withhold
admiration
they
were
pioneers
fine
brass
creatures
and
when
handled
right
they
were
a
wonderful
help
in
the
forest
he
did
not
blame
the
gunners
for
patting
the
barrels
for
scraping
the
mud
of
the
creek
crossing
from
the
wheels
and
for
speaking
to
them
affectionately
massive
and
polished
they
gleamed
in
the
sun
and
inspired
confidence
tayoga
went
ahead
in
the
forest
but
came
back
soon
and
reported
a
low
ridge
not
more
than
half
a
mile
farther
on
a
likely
place
for
an
attack
which
he
judged
would
come
there
it
would
be
made
by
the
united
force
of
the
french
and
indians
and
would
be
severe
so
be
it
said
elihu
strong
whose
iron
calm
nothing
disturbed
we
are
ready
for
the
foe
though
luc
himself
should
come
it
is
true
that
instead
of
two
cannon
we
might
have
had
four
or
even
six
or
twice
as
many
men
if
the
governor
and
legislature
of
massachusetts
had
done
their
full
duty
but
we
let
that
pass
will
you
lennox
and
you
tayoga
advance
with
the
scouts
and
be
my
eyes
robert
appreciated
the
compliment
to
the
full
and
promptly
replied
in
the
affirmative
for
them
both
then
he
and
tayoga
at
once
plunged
into
the
forest
with
the
borderers
who
were
there
to
provide
against
ambush
all
of
them
approaching
the
menacing
ridge
with
great
care
it
was
a
long
projection
rising
about
a
hundred
feet
and
grown
densely
with
trees
and
bushes
it
looked
very
quiet
and
peaceful
and
birds
even
were
singing
there
among
the
boughs
the
leader
of
the
scouts
a
bronzed
man
of
middle
age
named
adams
turned
to
tayoga
i
see
nothing
there
he
said
but
i
heard
of
you
and
your
power
to
find
things
where
others
ca
do
you
think
they
on
that
ridge
waiting
for
us
it
is
certain
replied
the
onondaga
it
is
the
place
best
fitted
for
them
and
they
will
not
neglect
it
let
me
go
forward
a
little
with
my
friend
dagaeoga
and
we
will
unveil
them
we
wait
here
and
if
they
on
it
i
believe
you
soon
know
it
said
adams
confidently
tayoga
slid
forward
among
the
bushes
and
robert
followed
neither
made
the
slightest
noise
and
they
drew
much
nearer
to
the
ridge
which
still
basked
in
the
sun
peaceful
and
innocent
in
looks
not
a
warrior
or
a
frenchman
appeared
there
the
bushes
gave
back
no
glint
of
weapons
nothing
was
disclosed
they
may
be
hidden
in
that
jungle
but
they
wo
stir
until
under
the
muzzles
of
their
rifles
what
do
you
propose
to
do
asked
robert
i
will
tempt
them
dagaeoga
tempt
them
i
do
understand
you
tododaho
on
his
great
star
which
we
can
not
see
in
the
day
but
which
nevertheless
is
there
whispers
to
me
that
tandakora
himself
is
among
the
bushes
on
the
ridge
it
is
just
such
an
ambush
as
he
loves
as
you
know
dagaeoga
he
hates
us
all
but
he
hates
me
most
if
he
sees
a
good
opportunity
for
a
shot
at
me
he
will
not
be
able
to
forego
it
for
heaven
sake
tayoga
do
make
a
martyr
of
yourself
merely
to
draw
the
enemy
fire
no
such
thought
was
in
my
mind
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
leave
the
world
which
i
find
bright
and
full
of
interest
moreover
i
wish
to
see
the
end
of
this
war
and
what
will
happen
afterward
risks
are
a
part
of
our
life
dagaeoga
but
i
will
take
none
that
is
undue
tayoga
spoke
in
his
usual
precise
book
english
explaining
everything
fully
and
robert
said
nothing
more
but
he
awaited
the
actions
of
the
onondaga
with
intense
interest
tayoga
crept
forward
five
or
six
yards
more
and
then
he
stumbled
striking
against
a
bush
and
shaking
it
violently
robert
was
amazed
it
was
incredible
that
the
onondaga
should
be
so
awkward
and
then
he
remembered
tayoga
was
going
to
draw
the
enemy
fire
tayoga
struck
against
another
bush
and
then
stood
upright
and
visible
those
hidden
on
the
ridge
if
such
there
were
could
see
him
clearly
the
response
was
immediate
a
gigantic
figure
stood
up
among
the
bushes
leveled
a
rifle
and
fired
at
him
point
blank
but
the
onondaga
quick
as
lightning
dropped
back
and
the
bullet
whistled
over
his
head
robert
fired
at
the
great
painted
figure
of
tandakora
but
he
too
missed
and
in
a
moment
the
ojibway
chief
sank
down
in
the
undergrowth
a
shout
came
from
the
hidden
indians
about
him
they
are
there
said
tayoga
and
we
know
just
where
many
of
them
lie
we
will
suggest
to
open
eyes
that
he
fire
the
cannon
at
that
point
they
rejoined
adams
you
were
right
as
i
knew
you
be
said
the
scout
you
located
yes
because
tandakora
could
not
resist
his
hate
of
me
said
the
onondaga
they
withdrew
to
the
main
force
and
once
more
the
brave
brass
guns
were
brought
up
sending
solid
shot
and
grape
into
the
bushes
on
the
ridge
then
moving
forward
and
repeating
the
fire
many
rifles
opened
upon
them
from
the
thickets
and
several
men
fell
but
elihu
strong
held
his
people
in
hand
and
the
scouts
drove
back
the
sharpshooters
meanwhile
the
whole
force
advanced
and
began
to
climb
the
ridge
the
cannon
being
turned
on
the
flanks
where
the
attack
was
now
heaviest
a
fierce
battle
ensued
and
the
guns
served
with
great
skill
and
effectiveness
kept
the
indians
at
bay
more
of
strong
men
were
slain
and
many
were
hit
but
their
own
rifles
backed
up
the
guns
with
a
deadly
fire
thus
the
combat
was
waged
in
the
thickets
a
full
two
hours
when
they
heard
a
great
shout
toward
the
north
and
willet
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
men
broke
his
way
through
to
their
relief
then
french
and
indians
drew
off
and
the
united
forces
proceeded
to
the
point
where
colden
wilton
carson
and
grosvenor
gave
them
a
great
welcome
we
are
here
said
elihu
strong
if
the
governor
and
legislature
of
massachusetts
had
done
their
full
duty
we
might
have
been
here
sooner
but
here
we
are
i
knew
that
you
would
come
back
and
bring
help
with
you
said
grosvenor
to
robert
i
felt
sure
that
tayoga
would
guide
the
canoe
through
every
peril
your
confidence
was
not
misplaced
said
robert
he
did
some
wonderful
work
he
was
as
great
a
trailer
on
the
water
as
he
is
on
land
now
that
we
are
so
much
stronger
i
wonder
what
luc
is
going
to
do
but
black
rifle
came
in
the
next
morning
with
the
news
that
the
chevalier
and
his
whole
force
were
gone
they
had
stolen
away
silently
in
the
night
and
were
now
marching
northward
probably
to
join
montcalm
i
not
surprised
said
willet
we
now
too
strong
for
him
and
luc
is
not
the
man
to
waste
his
time
and
strength
in
vain
endeavors
i
suspect
that
we
will
next
hear
of
him
near
champlain
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
ticonderoga
i
think
we
better
follow
his
trail
a
little
distance
willet
himself
led
the
band
that
pursued
luc
and
it
included
tayoga
robert
grosvenor
black
rifle
and
adams
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
having
left
shortly
before
on
an
expedition
of
their
own
it
was
an
easy
enough
task
as
the
trail
necessarily
was
wide
and
deep
and
the
onondaga
could
read
it
almost
with
his
eyes
shut
here
went
sharp
sword
he
said
after
looking
about
a
while
i
find
traces
of
his
moccasins
which
i
would
know
anywhere
because
i
have
seen
them
so
many
times
before
here
another
frenchman
joined
him
and
walked
beside
him
for
a
while
it
was
jumonville
whose
imprints
i
also
know
they
talked
together
perhaps
jumonville
was
narrating
the
details
of
his
encounter
with
us
now
he
leaves
luc
who
is
joined
by
another
frenchman
wearing
moccasins
but
the
man
is
heavy
and
walked
with
a
heavy
step
it
is
the
canadian
dubois
who
attends
upon
sharp
sword
and
who
is
devoted
to
him
perhaps
sharp
sword
is
giving
him
instructions
about
the
camp
that
they
will
make
when
the
day
is
over
now
dubois
also
goes
and
here
come
the
great
moccasins
of
tandakora
i
have
seen
none
other
so
large
in
the
woods
and
a
child
would
know
them
he
too
talks
with
sharp
sword
but
sharp
sword
does
not
stop
for
him
they
walk
on
together
because
the
stride
continues
steady
and
even
just
the
length
that
a
man
of
sharp
sword
height
would
make
when
walking
tandakora
is
very
angry
not
at
sharp
sword
he
would
not
dare
to
show
anger
against
him
but
at
the
will
of
manitou
who
would
not
let
him
win
a
victory
over
us
he
did
not
get
much
satisfaction
from
sharp
sword
because
he
stayed
with
him
only
a
very
short
time
here
his
trail
leads
away
again
and
sharp
sword
once
more
walks
on
alone
perhaps
sharp
sword
prefers
to
be
alone
most
men
do
after
a
disappointment
and
he
knows
that
his
attack
upon
the
boat
builders
has
been
a
failure
sharp
sword
does
not
like
failures
any
more
than
other
people
do
and
he
wants
to
think
he
is
planning
how
to
win
a
great
success
and
to
atone
for
his
failure
here
i
do
not
see
anything
of
de
courcelles
i
do
not
find
his
trail
anywhere
which
shows
that
the
wound
you
gave
him
dagaeoga
was
severe
he
is
being
carried
either
by
warriors
or
french
soldiers
on
a
litter
it
is
far
more
likely
to
be
soldiers
and
here
i
find
them
the
trail
of
four
men
who
walk
exactly
even
two
by
two
all
the
time
the
rage
of
de
courcelles
will
mount
very
high
against
you
dagaeoga
and
you
will
have
to
beware
of
him
i
am
ready
for
him
said
robert
proudly
the
broad
trail
led
steadily
on
toward
the
north
but
willet
after
a
while
spread
out
his
own
little
force
taking
no
chances
with
forest
ambush
he
considered
it
highly
probable
that
before
long
tandakora
would
curve
aside
with
some
of
his
warriors
hoping
to
trap
the
unwary
he
was
confirmed
in
his
opinion
by
the
onondaga
reading
of
the
trail
i
find
the
footprints
of
the
ojibway
chief
again
said
tayoga
here
they
go
at
the
edge
of
the
trail
now
he
has
stopped
his
stride
has
ceased
and
he
stands
with
his
moccasins
close
together
he
is
probably
talking
with
his
warriors
and
he
meditates
something
the
rage
of
tandakora
is
as
great
as
that
of
de
courcelles
but
tandakora
is
not
hurt
and
he
is
able
to
strike
he
moves
on
again
and
ah
here
he
goes
into
the
woods
beyond
question
he
is
now
engaged
in
planting
an
ambush
for
those
who
would
follow
luc
shall
we
go
back
great
bear
or
shall
we
meet
the
ojibway
ambush
with
an
ambush
of
our
own
the
black
eyes
of
the
onondaga
sparkled
we
ought
to
turn
back
replied
willet
but
i
ca
resist
playing
tandakora
own
game
with
him
it
may
give
us
a
chance
to
rid
the
border
of
that
scourge
we
leave
the
trail
and
go
into
the
deep
bush
led
by
the
hunter
the
little
band
plunged
into
the
forest
and
began
a
careful
circle
intending
to
come
back
to
the
trail
some
distance
ahead
and
to
post
themselves
behind
tandakora
in
case
that
wily
savage
was
planning
an
ambush
as
they
felt
sure
he
was
they
redoubled
their
precautions
ceasing
all
talk
for
the
while
and
allowing
no
bushes
to
rustle
as
they
passed
willet
led
the
line
and
tayoga
brought
up
the
rear
grosvenor
was
just
behind
robert
he
too
was
now
able
to
bring
down
his
feet
in
soundless
fashion
and
to
avoid
every
stick
or
twig
that
might
break
with
a
crack
beneath
his
weight
while
he
was
aware
of
the
perils
before
them
his
heart
beat
high
he
felt
that
he
was
making
further
progress
and
that
he
was
becoming
a
worthy
forest
runner
after
two
careful
hours
of
travel
they
came
back
again
to
the
broad
trail
which
showed
that
luc
was
still
maintaining
steady
progress
toward
the
north
but
both
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
felt
sure
that
tandakora
and
a
chosen
band
were
now
to
the
south
waiting
in
ambush
for
those
who
would
come
in
pursuit
we
better
draw
if
we
can
said
willet
let
know
here
but
make
believe
we
friends
i
think
i
can
do
it
said
tayoga
i
know
huron
and
regis
signals
it
is
likely
that
some
of
the
warriors
with
tandakora
are
hurons
and
in
any
event
the
ojibway
will
understand
the
signals
he
imitated
the
cawing
of
a
crow
and
presently
the
answer
came
from
the
forest
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
south
the
cry
was
repeated
and
the
answer
came
duly
a
second
time
no
one
in
the
little
band
now
doubted
that
tandakora
and
his
men
were
there
shall
we
attack
asked
robert
i
think
we
can
sting
them
a
little
replied
willet
our
numbers
are
few
but
the
force
of
the
ojibway
is
not
likely
to
be
large
it
was
his
purpose
to
strike
and
get
away
and
that
what
we
do
now
tayoga
we
relying
upon
you
to
get
us
into
a
good
position
on
his
flank
the
onondaga
led
them
in
another
but
much
smaller
circle
toward
the
forest
from
which
the
answering
caws
of
the
crow
had
come
the
way
went
through
dense
thickets
but
before
he
reached
his
chosen
spot
he
stopped
look
he
said
pointing
to
the
earth
where
there
were
faint
traces
that
robert
could
scarcely
see
and
over
which
he
would
have
passed
unnoticing
here
is
where
tandakora
went
on
his
way
to
the
ambush
it
is
a
little
trail
and
it
was
to
be
only
a
little
ambush
he
has
only
about
ten
warriors
with
him
the
ojibway
has
come
back
for
revenge
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
without
striking
at
least
one
blow
perhaps
he
slipped
away
from
sharp
sword
to
try
the
ambush
on
his
own
account
they
ca
be
far
ahead
said
the
hunter
no
said
the
onondaga
they
will
be
coming
back
in
response
to
my
call
and
i
think
we
would
better
await
them
here
they
disposed
themselves
in
good
order
for
battle
and
then
sank
to
the
earth
light
waves
of
air
registered
delicately
but
clearly
on
those
wonderful
eardrums
of
tayoga
faint
though
the
sound
was
he
understood
it
it
was
the
careful
tread
of
men
tandakora
and
his
warriors
were
on
the
way
called
by
the
crow
he
knew
when
they
came
within
a
hundred
yards
of
where
he
and
his
companions
lay
and
he
knew
when
they
spread
out
in
cautious
fashion
to
see
what
manner
of
friends
these
were
who
came
he
knew
too
that
tandakora
would
not
walk
into
a
trap
and
he
had
not
expected
at
any
time
that
he
would
it
having
been
merely
his
purpose
when
he
cawed
like
a
crow
to
call
him
back
to
fair
and
honorable
combat
ambush
against
ambush
he
noted
when
the
thin
line
of
detached
warriors
began
to
advance
again
he
was
even
able
to
trace
the
step
of
tandakora
heavier
than
the
others
and
to
discern
when
the
ojibway
chief
stopped
a
second
time
trying
to
pierce
the
thickets
with
his
eyes
tandakora
is
in
doubt
he
whispered
to
robert
the
call
of
the
crow
which
at
first
seemed
so
friendly
has
another
meaning
now
he
is
not
so
sure
that
friends
are
here
after
all
but
he
does
not
understand
how
an
enemy
happens
to
be
behind
him
he
is
angry
too
that
his
own
pretty
ambush
in
which
he
was
sitting
so
cunningly
waiting
for
us
is
broken
up
tandakora
humor
is
far
from
good
but
because
of
it
mine
is
excellent
you
certainly
learned
the
dictionary
well
when
you
were
in
our
schools
robert
whispered
back
but
as
full
as
ever
of
admiration
for
tayoga
powers
has
all
sound
ceased
now
they
are
not
stirring
they
have
become
quite
sure
that
we
are
enemies
and
they
wait
for
us
to
act
first
then
i
give
a
lead
said
willet
who
lay
on
tayoga
right
he
thrust
out
a
foot
bringing
it
down
on
a
dead
stick
so
hard
that
it
broke
with
a
sharp
snap
but
instantly
drew
away
to
the
shelter
of
another
bush
a
rifle
cracked
in
front
of
them
and
a
bullet
cut
the
air
over
the
broken
stick
before
the
warrior
who
fired
the
bullet
could
sink
back
black
rifle
pulled
the
trigger
at
a
certain
target
and
the
man
fell
without
a
sound
a
fine
shot
captain
jack
said
willet
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
hunter
himself
made
another
just
as
good
for
a
half
hour
the
combat
was
waged
in
the
deep
thickets
mere
glimpses
serving
for
aim
but
the
combatants
were
as
fierce
and
tenacious
as
if
the
issue
were
joined
by
great
armies
four
warriors
fell
willet
band
suffered
only
a
few
scratches
and
then
at
a
signal
from
him
they
melted
away
into
the
woods
curved
about
again
and
took
up
the
return
journey
toward
their
own
force
we
did
enough
said
willet
when
he
was
sure
they
were
not
pursued
by
tandakora
all
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
sting
the
ojibway
and
not
to
let
him
forget
that
those
who
ambush
may
be
ambushed
he
be
fairly
burning
with
anger
how
are
you
feeling
red
coat
asked
tayoga
as
well
as
could
be
expected
after
such
an
experience
replied
grosvenor
with
pride
but
the
young
englishman
was
very
sober
too
a
warrior
had
fallen
before
his
rifle
and
with
the
heat
of
battle
over
he
was
very
thoughtful
chapter
xii
the
french
camp
they
returned
to
the
camp
without
further
event
colden
and
strong
were
gratified
to
learn
that
the
retreat
of
luc
was
real
and
that
he
was
certainly
going
toward
champlain
with
the
obvious
intention
of
joining
montcalm
we
owe
you
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
colonel
said
the
young
officer
frankly
to
elihu
strong
if
you
had
not
come
i
do
think
we
could
have
held
out
against
st
luc
we
did
the
best
we
could
replied
elihu
strong
if
the
governor
and
legislature
of
massachusetts
had
done
their
full
duty
we
have
been
here
earlier
with
twice
as
many
men
and
guns
but
as
it
is
we
did
our
best
and
man
can
do
no
more
they
decided
that
they
would
hold
the
point
and
await
the
coming
of
the
great
army
under
abercrombie
which
was
to
crush
montcalm
the
outworks
were
built
higher
and
stronger
and
the
brass
cannon
were
mounted
upon
them
at
points
where
they
could
sweep
the
forest
these
fine
were
sources
of
much
moral
courage
and
added
greatly
to
the
spirits
of
the
troops
they
had
shown
their
power
at
the
forcing
of
the
ford
and
at
the
taking
of
the
ridge
and
their
brazen
mouths
menacing
the
forest
looked
well
willet
and
his
comrades
considered
it
their
duty
to
stay
there
also
and
wait
for
abercrombie
and
the
third
day
after
the
retreat
of
luc
robert
and
tayoga
went
into
the
woods
to
see
whether
tandakora
had
turned
back
again
with
his
warriors
they
reckoned
that
the
ojibway
chief
anger
was
so
strong
that
he
would
make
another
attempt
at
revenge
upon
those
who
had
defeated
him
there
was
a
rumor
that
the
indians
with
the
french
were
becoming
much
dissatisfied
that
they
were
awed
by
the
reports
of
the
mighty
british
and
american
force
advancing
under
abercrombie
and
might
leave
the
french
to
meet
it
alone
do
you
think
there
is
much
in
these
rumors
asked
robert
as
he
and
the
onondaga
went
into
the
forest
i
do
replied
tayoga
the
warriors
with
the
french
do
not
like
the
cannon
and
they
say
the
force
that
is
coming
against
montcalm
is
very
vast
a
great
battle
may
be
fought
but
tandakora
and
his
men
are
not
likely
to
be
there
they
will
go
away
and
await
a
better
day
then
i
glad
they
desert
for
a
while
they
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
french
that
will
leave
our
own
scouts
and
forest
runners
the
lords
of
the
wild
though
it
seems
to
me
tayoga
that
you
the
true
and
veritable
lord
of
the
wild
then
if
that
were
so
though
you
praise
my
skill
too
much
dagaeoga
you
and
the
great
bear
and
black
rifle
also
are
lords
of
the
wild
lords
of
the
wild
i
like
the
term
it
is
something
to
be
that
at
this
time
and
in
this
region
we
mainly
a
wilderness
people
tayoga
and
our
wars
are
waged
in
the
woods
we
not
more
than
two
miles
from
the
camp
now
and
yet
we
completely
lost
in
the
forest
there
not
a
trace
of
man
i
do
even
see
any
smoke
soiling
the
sky
it
is
so
dagaeoga
and
we
are
again
in
the
shadow
of
peril
dangers
in
the
forest
are
as
thick
as
leaves
on
the
trees
here
is
an
old
trail
of
our
enemies
i
not
interested
in
old
trails
what
we
looking
for
is
new
ones
if
we
keep
going
toward
the
north
it
may
be
that
we
will
find
them
dagaeoga
several
miles
farther
on
they
came
to
other
trails
which
the
onondaga
examined
with
great
interest
and
care
two
or
three
he
pronounced
quite
recent
but
he
did
not
read
any
particular
purpose
in
them
it
is
likely
that
they
were
made
by
hunters
he
said
while
the
armies
are
gathering
the
warriors
are
sure
to
seek
game
here
two
of
them
passed
and
here
they
stood
behind
a
tree
it
is
sure
now
that
those
two
were
hunting
i
think
they
stood
behind
a
tree
to
ambush
a
deer
the
deer
was
to
the
west
of
them
the
traces
they
left
in
the
soft
earth
under
the
tree
show
that
the
toes
of
their
moccasins
pointed
toward
the
west
and
so
they
were
looking
that
way
at
the
deer
which
probably
stood
in
the
thicket
over
there
nibbling
at
its
food
they
must
have
had
an
easy
shot
now
we
enter
the
thicket
lo
dagaeoga
here
is
where
the
deer
fell
look
at
the
little
bushes
broken
and
at
the
dark
stain
on
the
ground
where
its
life
flowed
out
they
dragged
the
body
to
the
other
side
of
the
thicket
and
cut
it
up
there
nothing
could
be
plainer
the
traces
are
so
numerous
they
were
casual
hunters
and
it
is
not
worth
our
while
to
follow
them
northward
they
still
pursued
their
course
and
struck
another
and
larger
trail
which
made
tayoga
look
grave
this
is
the
path
of
seven
or
eight
warriors
he
said
and
it
is
likely
that
they
are
a
scouting
party
they
have
come
back
as
we
expected
to
spy
upon
us
and
to
cut
off
stragglers
from
our
camp
we
will
follow
it
a
little
while
it
led
south
by
west
and
seemed
to
go
on
with
a
definite
purpose
but
after
a
mile
or
so
it
divided
four
warriors
as
tayoga
said
going
in
one
direction
and
three
in
the
other
suppose
i
follow
those
on
the
north
a
short
distance
while
you
take
those
on
the
south
suggested
robert
we
will
do
so
said
tayoga
and
in
an
hour
come
back
to
this
point
the
three
warriors
were
on
the
north
and
as
the
earth
was
soft
robert
saw
their
trail
quite
clearly
leading
steadily
west
by
north
his
own
ambition
to
excel
as
a
trailer
was
aroused
and
he
followed
it
with
great
energy
two
or
three
times
when
the
ground
became
hard
and
rocky
he
lost
it
but
a
little
search
always
disclosed
it
again
and
he
renewed
the
pursuit
with
increased
zeal
he
went
on
over
a
hill
and
then
into
a
wide
valley
well
grown
with
thickets
pushing
his
way
through
the
bushes
he
sought
the
traces
and
was
startled
by
a
sound
almost
at
his
shoulder
keyed
to
the
dangers
of
the
forest
he
whirled
instantly
but
it
was
too
late
a
powerful
warrior
threw
himself
upon
him
and
though
robert
by
a
great
effort
threw
him
off
he
sprang
back
and
another
on
the
other
side
also
seized
him
he
was
borne
to
the
earth
and
a
third
indian
coming
up
he
was
quickly
secured
robert
at
first
was
so
sick
with
chagrin
that
he
did
not
think
about
his
life
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
warriors
would
have
tomahawked
him
and
this
he
soon
realized
thankful
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
been
spared
for
the
present
at
least
yet
his
mortification
endured
what
would
tayoga
say
when
he
saw
by
the
trail
that
he
had
been
caught
so
easily
he
had
fairly
walked
into
the
trap
and
he
was
now
a
prisoner
the
second
time
yet
he
showed
the
stoicism
that
he
had
learned
in
a
forest
life
while
the
indians
bound
his
wrists
tightly
with
rawhide
thongs
he
stood
up
and
looked
them
squarely
in
the
face
one
of
the
warriors
took
his
rifle
and
examined
it
with
a
pleased
eye
another
appropriated
his
pistol
and
a
third
helped
himself
to
his
knife
and
hatchet
i
four
shillings
in
an
inside
pocket
said
robert
if
you
want
take
but
the
warriors
did
not
understand
english
and
shook
their
heads
evidently
they
were
satisfied
with
the
spoil
they
had
taken
already
which
way
asked
robert
they
replied
by
leading
him
to
the
northwest
he
was
hopeful
at
first
that
tayoga
might
rescue
him
as
he
had
done
once
before
but
the
warriors
were
wary
and
powerful
and
three
too
were
too
many
for
the
onondaga
alone
to
attack
the
thought
passed
and
by
an
effort
of
the
will
he
resigned
himself
to
his
immediate
captivity
they
did
not
mean
to
take
his
life
and
while
there
was
no
hope
for
the
present
there
was
plenty
of
it
for
the
future
he
could
be
in
a
far
worse
case
his
unfailing
optimism
broke
through
the
shell
of
mortification
and
he
became
resolutely
cheerful
which
way
my
friends
he
said
to
the
warriors
but
again
they
understood
no
english
and
shook
their
heads
do
plume
yourself
too
much
on
that
rifle
he
said
speaking
to
the
warrior
who
had
taken
his
favorite
weapon
you
have
it
for
the
present
but
when
i
escape
for
the
second
time
i
mean
to
take
it
with
me
i
give
you
fair
warning
the
warrior
who
seemed
to
be
good
natured
shook
his
head
once
more
and
grinned
not
abating
at
all
his
air
of
proprietorship
so
far
as
the
rifle
was
concerned
and
you
with
the
pistol
continued
the
prisoner
i
beg
to
tell
you
it
mine
not
yours
and
i
shall
claim
it
again
what
you
understand
well
i
have
to
find
some
way
to
make
you
comprehend
later
on
the
three
warriors
walked
briskly
and
robert
of
course
had
no
choice
but
to
keep
pace
with
them
they
indicated
very
conclusively
that
they
knew
where
they
meant
to
go
and
so
he
assumed
that
a
hostile
camp
was
not
very
far
away
resolved
to
show
no
sign
of
discouragement
he
held
his
head
erect
and
stepped
springily
about
three
miles
and
he
saw
a
gleam
of
uniforms
through
the
trees
a
few
steps
more
and
his
heart
gave
a
leap
he
beheld
a
group
of
indians
and
several
frenchmen
and
one
of
them
tall
young
distinguished
was
luc
the
chevalier
was
in
a
white
uniform
trimmed
with
silver
a
silver
hilted
small
sword
by
his
side
and
his
smile
was
not
unpleasant
when
he
said
to
robert
i
sent
out
these
three
warriors
to
find
me
a
prisoner
and
bring
him
in
but
i
little
suspected
that
it
would
be
you
i
suspected
as
little
that
it
was
you
to
whom
i
was
being
taken
said
robert
but
since
i
had
to
be
a
prisoner
i
glad
i
yours
instead
of
de
courcelles
or
jumonville
as
those
two
soldiers
of
france
have
as
little
cause
to
love
me
as
i
have
to
love
them
monsieur
de
courcelles
is
suffering
from
a
bullet
wound
it
was
my
bullet
you
say
that
rather
proudly
but
perhaps
i
better
not
tell
it
to
him
it
seems
lennox
that
you
have
a
certain
facility
in
getting
yourself
captured
as
this
is
the
second
time
within
a
year
i
was
treated
so
well
by
the
french
that
i
thought
i
could
risk
it
again
said
robert
jauntily
the
chevalier
smiled
robert
felt
again
that
current
of
understanding
and
sympathy
that
so
it
seemed
to
him
had
passed
so
often
between
them
i
see
said
luc
that
you
are
willing
to
give
credit
to
france
the
evergreen
nation
the
nation
of
light
and
eternal
life
we
may
lose
at
times
we
may
be
defeated
at
times
but
we
always
rise
anew
you
british
and
americans
will
realize
that
some
day
i
do
not
hate
france
i
do
think
you
do
but
this
is
scarcely
a
time
for
me
to
give
you
a
lecture
on
french
qualities
sit
down
on
this
log
i
trust
that
my
warriors
did
not
treat
you
with
undue
harshness
i
nothing
to
complain
of
they
took
my
weapons
but
that
is
the
law
of
war
i
have
done
the
same
in
their
place
as
i
see
it
they
not
particularly
bad
indians
but
if
you
do
mind
i
like
you
to
cut
these
rawhide
thongs
that
bind
my
wrists
they
beginning
to
sting
the
chevalier
drew
a
knife
and
with
one
sweep
of
its
keen
edge
severed
the
rawhide
robert
wrists
flew
apart
and
the
blood
once
more
flowed
freely
through
his
veins
though
the
stinging
did
not
cease
he
felt
great
relief
i
thank
you
he
said
politely
but
as
i
told
you
before
i
do
not
hold
it
against
your
warriors
because
they
bound
me
i
have
escaped
had
they
given
me
any
chance
at
all
and
i
warn
you
now
as
i
warned
them
that
i
intend
to
escape
later
on
luc
smiled
i
accept
the
challenge
he
said
and
i
see
that
you
make
good
your
boast
i
can
assure
you
too
if
by
any
possibility
you
should
escape
it
certainly
will
not
be
before
the
great
battle
great
battle
what
great
battle
you
do
mean
that
montcalm
will
dare
to
meet
abercrombie
such
an
idea
was
in
my
mind
why
we
come
with
four
or
five
to
one
the
marquis
de
montcalm
can
not
stand
against
such
a
powerful
force
as
ours
we
definite
information
that
he
wo
be
able
to
muster
more
than
three
or
four
thousand
men
we
hear
too
that
the
indians
frightened
by
our
power
are
leaving
him
for
the
time
at
least
some
of
your
surmises
may
be
correct
but
your
facts
do
follow
from
them
the
marquis
de
montcalm
our
great
leader
will
await
your
abercrombie
no
matter
what
your
force
may
be
i
violate
no
military
secret
when
i
tell
you
that
and
i
tell
you
also
that
you
are
very
far
from
being
assured
of
any
victory
the
chevalier
suddenly
dropped
his
light
manner
and
became
intensely
earnest
his
eyes
gleamed
for
an
instant
with
blue
fire
but
it
was
only
a
passing
moment
of
emotion
he
was
in
an
instant
his
old
easy
self
again
we
talk
like
the
debaters
of
the
schools
he
said
when
we
are
at
war
i
am
to
march
in
a
few
minutes
i
suggest
that
in
return
for
certain
liberties
you
give
me
your
pledge
to
attempt
no
escape
until
we
arrive
at
the
camp
of
the
marquis
de
montcalm
i
ca
do
it
since
i
promised
you
that
i
will
escape
i
must
neglect
no
chance
so
be
it
then
i
must
guard
you
well
but
i
will
not
have
your
wrists
bound
again
here
comes
an
expert
rover
of
the
forest
who
will
be
your
immediate
jailer
a
white
man
at
the
head
of
several
warriors
was
approaching
through
the
woods
he
was
young
lean
with
a
fierce
hooked
roman
nose
and
a
bold
aggressive
face
tanned
to
the
color
of
mahogany
robert
recognized
him
at
once
and
since
he
had
to
be
a
prisoner
a
second
time
he
took
a
certain
pleasure
in
the
meeting
how
do
you
do
monsieur
langlade
he
said
you
see
i
come
back
i
forgot
to
tell
you
and
i
here
to
make
amends
for
my
lack
of
politeness
and
how
is
the
patient
and
watchful
spouse
the
dove
robert
spoke
in
good
french
and
the
partisan
stared
in
astonishment
then
a
pleased
look
of
recognition
came
into
his
eyes
ah
it
young
lennox
he
exclaimed
young
lennox
come
back
to
us
it
not
mere
politeness
that
makes
me
tell
you
i
glad
to
see
you
you
did
make
a
very
clever
escape
with
the
aid
of
that
indian
friend
of
yours
i
hope
to
capture
tayoga
some
day
and
if
i
do
it
will
be
an
achievement
of
which
i
shall
boast
all
the
rest
of
my
life
but
we
take
good
care
that
you
do
leave
us
again
he
has
just
warned
me
that
he
intends
to
escape
a
second
time
said
luc
then
it
will
be
a
pretty
test
of
mettle
said
the
owl
appreciation
showing
in
his
tone
and
we
welcome
it
have
you
any
commands
for
me
sir
he
spoke
with
great
respect
when
he
addressed
the
query
to
luc
and
the
chevalier
replied
that
they
would
march
in
a
half
hour
then
langlade
gave
robert
food
and
took
a
little
himself
sitting
with
the
prisoner
and
informing
him
that
the
dove
had
worried
greatly
over
his
escape
although
she
was
not
to
blame
she
considered
that
in
some
indirect
manner
it
was
a
reflection
upon
her
vigilance
and
it
was
many
months
before
she
was
fully
consoled
i
must
send
word
to
her
by
one
of
our
runners
that
you
have
been
retaken
said
the
owl
and
i
wish
to
tell
you
lennox
that
the
dove
younger
sister
who
is
so
much
like
her
in
looks
and
character
is
still
unmarried
and
perhaps
it
may
come
into
the
mind
of
the
chevalier
de
luc
or
the
marquis
de
montcalm
to
send
you
back
to
our
village
you
once
more
most
polite
laughed
robert
but
i
far
too
young
yet
to
think
of
marriage
it
not
an
offer
that
i
make
to
many
young
men
said
langlade
regretfully
in
truth
i
know
of
none
other
to
whom
i
have
mentioned
it
when
they
took
up
the
march
the
force
numbered
about
fifty
men
and
robert
walked
between
langlade
and
a
stalwart
indian
luc
was
further
on
they
did
not
seem
to
fear
any
ambush
and
langlade
chattered
after
his
fashion
he
made
the
most
of
the
french
resources
he
spoke
as
if
the
marquis
de
montcalm
had
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
veteran
french
regulars
and
half
as
many
indian
warriors
do
consider
me
contentious
monsieur
langlade
said
robert
at
last
but
i
know
full
well
that
your
general
has
not
half
that
many
troops
no
not
a
third
and
that
nearly
all
his
indians
are
about
to
leave
him
and
how
do
you
know
that
exclaimed
the
owl
well
one
frenchman
equals
two
of
the
english
or
the
bostonnais
and
that
doubles
our
numbers
you
do
see
any
chance
to
escape
do
you
not
at
present
laughed
robert
not
now
nor
at
any
other
time
no
man
ever
escapes
twice
from
the
french
the
talk
of
langlade
his
frank
egotism
and
boastfulness
for
himself
personally
and
for
the
french
collectively
beguiled
the
journey
which
soon
became
strenuous
the
force
advancing
at
a
great
pace
through
the
forest
at
night
a
fire
was
built
in
the
deep
woods
the
knapsacks
furnished
plenty
of
food
and
robert
slept
soundly
on
a
blanket
until
dawn
he
had
seen
before
closing
his
eyes
that
a
strict
guard
was
set
and
he
knew
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
keep
awake
in
the
hope
of
escape
like
a
wise
man
he
dismissed
the
hope
of
the
impossible
at
once
and
waited
calmly
for
another
time
he
knew
too
that
luc
had
originally
sent
out
his
warriors
to
capture
a
prisoner
from
whom
they
might
drag
information
but
that
the
chevalier
would
not
try
to
him
knowing
its
futility
they
traveled
northward
by
east
all
the
next
day
through
very
rough
country
slept
another
night
in
the
forest
and
on
the
third
day
approached
a
great
camp
which
held
the
main
french
force
heart
thrilled
here
was
the
center
of
the
french
power
in
north
america
vaudreuil
and
bigot
at
quebec
might
plan
and
plot
and
weave
their
webs
but
in
the
end
the
mighty
struggle
between
french
and
english
and
their
colonies
must
be
decided
by
the
armies
he
knew
that
this
was
the
outlet
of
lake
george
and
he
knew
also
that
the
army
of
abercrombie
was
gathering
at
the
head
of
the
same
lake
his
interest
grew
keener
as
they
drew
nearer
he
saw
clusters
of
tents
cannon
parked
and
many
fires
there
were
no
earthworks
or
other
fortifications
and
he
inferred
from
their
absence
that
montcalm
was
undecided
whether
to
go
or
stay
but
robert
thought
proudly
that
he
would
surely
go
when
the
invincible
army
advanced
from
its
base
at
the
head
of
the
lake
the
whole
camp
lay
under
his
eye
and
he
had
enough
military
experience
now
to
judge
the
french
numbers
by
its
size
he
did
not
think
they
were
much
in
excess
of
three
thousand
and
as
abercrombie
would
come
four
or
five
to
one
montcalm
must
surely
retreat
i
take
it
that
this
is
ticonderoga
he
said
to
luc
aye
replied
the
chevalier
and
in
effect
you
have
champlain
on
one
side
of
you
and
george
on
the
other
but
you
ca
hold
the
place
against
our
great
force
i
here
in
time
to
join
you
in
your
retreat
we
do
seem
to
be
retreating
as
you
notice
lennox
and
i
do
know
that
we
will
still
that
rests
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
i
think
you
find
here
some
old
friends
and
enemies
of
yours
and
though
your
people
have
made
a
great
outcry
against
the
marquis
de
montcalm
because
of
the
affair
at
fort
william
henry
i
am
sure
you
will
find
that
the
french
know
how
to
treat
a
prisoner
i
shall
put
you
for
the
present
in
the
care
of
monsieur
langlade
with
whom
you
appear
to
have
no
quarrel
he
has
his
instructions
it
was
the
second
time
that
robert
had
entered
the
camp
of
montcalm
and
his
keen
interest
drove
away
for
the
present
all
thought
of
himself
he
noted
anew
the
uniforms
mostly
white
faced
with
blue
or
violet
or
red
or
yellow
and
with
black
hats
there
were
the
battalions
of
guienne
la
reine
béarn
la
sarre
languedoc
berry
and
royal
roussillon
the
canadians
swarthy
thick
and
strong
wore
white
with
black
facings
some
indians
were
about
but
fewer
than
robert
had
expected
it
was
true
then
that
they
had
become
alarmed
at
abercrombie
advancing
might
and
were
leaving
the
french
to
their
fate
you
are
to
stay
in
a
tent
with
me
said
langlade
and
you
will
be
so
thoroughly
surrounded
by
the
army
that
you
will
have
no
earthly
chance
of
escape
so
i
think
it
better
that
you
pledge
your
word
not
to
attempt
it
for
a
while
and
i
can
make
things
easier
for
you
no
i
decline
again
to
give
such
a
pledge
said
robert
firmly
i
warn
you
as
i
warned
the
chevalier
de
luc
that
i
going
to
escape
langlade
looked
at
him
searchingly
and
then
the
face
of
the
partisan
kindled
i
believe
you
mean
it
he
exclaimed
you
rely
on
yourself
and
you
think
too
that
clever
onondaga
tayoga
will
come
again
to
your
aid
i
acknowledge
that
he
a
great
trailer
that
he
master
of
some
things
that
even
i
charles
langlade
the
owl
do
not
know
but
he
can
not
steal
you
away
a
second
time
i
admit
that
i
been
thinking
of
tayoga
he
may
be
here
now
close
to
us
the
owl
gave
a
startled
look
at
the
empty
air
as
if
he
expected
tayoga
to
be
hovering
there
formidable
but
invisible
i
see
you
do
fear
him
laughed
robert
i
do
but
we
shall
be
a
match
for
him
this
time
though
i
never
underrate
his
powers
a
young
officer
in
a
captain
uniform
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
robert
then
he
advanced
and
extended
his
hand
it
is
evident
that
you
like
the
french
he
said
since
you
are
continually
coming
back
to
them
de
galissonnière
exclaimed
robert
as
he
warmly
shook
the
extended
hand
yes
here
i
am
and
i
do
like
many
of
the
french
i
sorry
we
official
enemies
i
know
that
our
people
will
treat
you
well
jested
de
galissonnière
and
then
when
we
take
new
york
you
can
tell
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
what
good
masters
we
are
and
teach
them
to
be
reconciled
young
lennox
made
a
reply
in
like
spirit
and
de
galissonnière
passed
on
but
a
man
walking
near
with
his
shoulder
well
bound
greeted
him
in
no
such
friendly
manner
instead
a
heavy
frown
came
over
his
face
and
his
eyes
flashed
cruelly
it
was
de
courcelles
nursing
the
wound
robert
had
given
him
and
at
the
same
time
increasing
his
anger
the
youth
returned
his
gaze
defiantly
colonel
de
courcelles
does
not
like
you
said
langlade
who
had
noticed
the
brief
exchange
he
does
not
replied
robert
it
was
my
bullet
that
hurt
his
shoulder
but
i
gave
him
the
wound
in
fair
combat
and
he
hates
you
because
of
it
that
and
other
things
what
a
strange
man
a
wound
received
in
fair
and
honorable
battle
should
be
a
tie
that
binds
if
you
had
given
it
to
me
in
a
combat
on
equal
terms
i
have
considered
it
an
honor
conferred
upon
me
by
you
it
would
have
wiped
away
all
grievance
and
have
made
us
friends
then
monsieur
langlade
i
afraid
i
missed
my
opportunity
to
make
our
friendship
warmer
than
it
is
how
is
that
i
held
you
also
under
the
muzzle
of
my
rifle
in
that
battle
in
the
forest
but
when
i
recognized
you
i
could
not
send
the
bullet
i
turned
the
weapon
aside
ah
that
was
in
truth
a
most
worthy
and
chivalrous
act
embrace
me
my
friend
no
no
we
american
men
never
embrace
or
kiss
one
another
i
should
have
remembered
a
cold
people
but
never
mind
you
are
my
brother
and
i
esteem
you
so
highly
that
i
shall
let
nothing
on
earth
take
you
away
from
us
can
you
not
reconsider
your
decision
about
the
sister
of
the
dove
she
would
make
you
a
most
admirable
wife
and
after
the
war
we
could
become
the
greatest
rangers
you
and
i
that
the
forest
has
ever
known
and
the
life
in
the
woods
is
marvelous
in
its
freedom
and
variety
but
robert
plead
extreme
youth
once
more
and
the
owl
was
forced
to
be
resigned
the
small
tent
in
which
guard
and
prisoner
were
to
sleep
was
almost
in
the
center
of
the
camp
and
robert
truly
would
have
needed
wings
and
the
power
of
invisibility
to
escape
then
instead
of
it
he
let
the
thought
pass
for
a
while
and
went
to
sleep
on
a
blanket
while
young
lennox
slept
luc
was
in
the
tent
of
montcalm
talking
with
his
leader
the
marquis
was
in
much
perplexity
his
spies
had
brought
him
word
of
the
great
force
that
was
mustering
in
the
south
and
he
did
not
know
whether
to
await
the
attack
at
ticonderoga
or
to
retreat
to
the
powerful
fortifications
at
crown
point
on
lake
champlain
his
own
ardent
soul
flushed
by
the
successes
he
had
already
won
told
him
to
stay
but
prudence
bade
him
go
now
he
wanted
to
hear
what
luc
had
to
say
and
wanting
it
he
knew
also
that
the
chevalier
was
the
most
valiant
and
daring
of
his
captains
he
wished
to
hear
from
the
dauntless
leader
just
what
he
wished
to
hear
and
nothing
else
your
observations
then
confirm
what
the
spies
have
reported
he
said
the
enemy
can
easily
control
lake
george
he
has
only
to
make
an
effort
to
do
so
my
general
replied
luc
i
could
have
captured
the
boat
builders
on
the
point
or
have
compelled
their
retirement
but
large
forces
came
to
their
relief
the
numbers
of
the
foe
are
even
greater
than
we
had
feared
how
many
men
do
you
think
general
abercrombie
will
have
when
he
advances
against
us
not
less
than
fifteen
thousand
sir
perhaps
more
the
face
of
montcalm
fell
as
many
as
that
he
exclaimed
it
is
more
than
four
to
one
he
can
not
have
less
sir
repeated
luc
positively
montcalm
brow
clouded
and
he
paced
back
and
forth
and
the
indians
who
have
been
so
powerful
an
ally
he
said
at
last
they
are
frightened
by
the
reports
concerning
the
army
after
their
fashion
they
wish
to
run
away
before
superior
force
and
fight
when
the
odds
are
not
so
great
it
is
most
embarrassing
to
lose
their
help
at
such
a
critical
time
can
you
do
nothing
with
this
sullen
giant
tandakora
who
has
such
influence
over
them
i
fear
not
sir
he
was
with
me
on
the
expedition
from
which
i
have
just
returned
and
he
fared
ill
he
is
in
a
most
savage
humor
he
is
like
a
bear
that
will
hide
in
the
woods
and
lick
its
hurts
until
the
sting
has
passed
i
think
we
may
consider
it
certain
sir
that
they
will
desert
us
for
the
time
and
we
shall
have
but
little
more
than
three
thousand
french
and
canadians
to
defend
the
honor
of
france
and
his
majesty
great
colony
in
north
america
we
might
retreat
to
the
fortifications
at
crown
point
and
make
an
advantageous
stand
there
but
it
goes
ill
with
me
to
withdraw
still
prudence
cries
upon
me
to
do
so
i
have
talked
with
bourlamaque
trepezec
lotbiniére
the
engineer
langy
the
partisan
and
other
of
my
lieutenants
whom
you
know
they
express
varying
opinions
now
colonel
de
luc
i
want
yours
an
opinion
that
is
absolutely
your
own
luc
drew
himself
up
and
his
warrior
soul
flashed
through
his
blue
eyes
sir
he
said
it
goes
as
ill
with
me
as
it
does
with
you
to
retreat
my
heart
is
here
at
ticonderoga
nor
does
prudence
suggest
to
me
that
we
retreat
to
crown
point
my
head
agreeing
with
my
heart
says
that
we
should
stand
here
and
that
is
your
conviction
it
is
sir
ticonderoga
is
ours
and
we
can
keep
it
upon
what
do
you
base
this
opinion
in
such
a
crisis
as
this
we
must
be
influenced
by
sound
military
reasons
and
not
by
sentiment
my
reasons
sir
are
military
that
is
why
my
heart
goes
with
my
head
it
is
true
that
the
army
will
come
in
overwhelming
numbers
but
they
may
be
overwhelming
numbers
that
will
not
overwhelm
as
we
know
the
british
commanders
have
not
adapted
themselves
as
well
as
the
french
to
wilderness
campaigning
their
tactics
and
strategy
are
the
same
as
those
they
practice
in
the
open
fields
of
europe
and
it
puts
them
at
a
great
disadvantage
we
have
been
willing
to
learn
from
the
indians
who
have
practiced
forest
warfare
for
centuries
and
the
british
colonials
the
bostonnais
fall
into
the
faults
of
the
parent
country
in
spite
of
all
experience
they
continue
to
despise
wilderness
wile
and
stratagem
and
in
a
manner
that
is
amazing
they
walk
continually
into
ambush
and
are
cut
up
before
they
can
get
out
of
it
i
am
not
one
to
cheapen
the
valor
of
british
and
british
colonials
it
has
been
proved
too
often
on
desperate
fields
but
in
the
kind
of
war
we
must
wage
here
deep
in
the
wilds
of
north
america
valor
is
often
unavailing
and
i
think
sir
that
we
can
rely
upon
one
fact
the
enemy
will
take
us
too
lightly
he
is
sure
to
do
something
that
will
keep
him
from
using
his
whole
force
at
the
right
moment
against
us
our
forest
knowledge
will
work
all
the
time
in
our
behalf
i
entreat
you
sir
to
keep
the
army
here
at
ticonderoga
and
await
the
attack
luc
spoke
with
intense
earnestness
and
his
words
had
all
the
ring
of
conviction
montcalm
dark
face
was
illumined
again
he
walked
back
and
forth
in
deep
thought
the
engineer
lotbiniére
a
man
whose
opinion
i
respect
is
of
your
mind
he
said
at
last
he
says
that
whether
crown
point
or
ticonderoga
it
merely
either
horn
of
the
dilemma
and
naturally
if
the
dangers
of
the
two
places
are
even
we
prefer
ticonderoga
and
no
retreat
the
marquis
de
vaudreuil
had
a
plan
to
save
ticonderoga
by
means
of
a
diversion
with
a
heavy
force
under
bourlamaque
de
levis
and
longueuil
into
the
mohawk
valley
but
some
american
rangers
taken
near
lake
george
by
langy
told
him
that
abercrombie
already
had
thirty
thousand
men
at
the
head
of
george
and
the
marquis
at
once
abandoned
the
scheme
it
was
lucky
for
us
the
rangers
exaggerated
so
much
that
the
plan
was
destined
to
failure
as
we
needed
here
the
men
who
were
sent
on
it
we
save
or
lose
ticonderoga
by
fighting
at
ticonderoga
itself
and
by
nothing
else
i
thank
you
colonel
de
luc
for
your
gallant
and
timely
words
i
have
been
wavering
and
they
have
decided
me
we
stay
here
and
await
the
army
and
the
star
of
france
will
not
fail
us
said
st
luc
with
intense
conviction
i
trust
not
i
feel
more
confidence
since
i
have
decided
and
i
do
know
this
the
young
men
who
are
my
lieutenants
are
as
brave
and
skillful
leaders
as
any
chief
could
desire
and
the
troops
will
fight
even
ten
to
one
if
i
ask
it
of
them
it
is
a
pleasure
and
a
glory
to
command
troops
of
such
incomparable
bravery
as
the
french
but
we
must
try
to
keep
the
indians
with
us
i
confess
that
i
know
little
about
dealing
with
them
has
this
savage
chief
tandakora
come
back
to
ticonderoga
i
think
he
is
here
sir
do
you
wish
me
to
talk
with
him
i
do
i
wish
it
very
much
he
is
very
sullen
sir
he
holds
that
the
indians
have
received
no
rewards
for
their
services
we
have
given
them
blankets
and
food
and
muskets
and
ammunition
he
takes
those
as
a
matter
of
course
but
he
means
something
else
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
the
savages
want
us
to
give
prisoners
to
them
montcalm
face
clouded
again
to
burn
at
the
stake
or
to
torture
to
death
otherwise
he
exclaimed
my
reputation
and
what
is
more
the
reputation
of
france
suffers
already
from
the
massacre
at
william
henry
though
god
knows
i
would
have
prevented
it
if
i
could
it
happened
so
suddenly
and
so
unexpectedly
that
i
could
not
stop
it
until
the
harm
was
done
but
never
luc
never
will
i
give
up
a
prisoner
to
them
for
their
tortures
though
every
savage
in
our
armies
desert
us
i
hold
with
you
sir
that
we
can
not
surrender
prisoners
to
them
even
though
the
cause
of
france
should
suffer
then
talk
to
this
savage
chief
make
him
see
reason
promise
him
and
his
people
what
you
wish
in
muskets
ammunition
blankets
and
such
things
but
no
prisoners
not
one
luc
with
a
respectful
salute
left
the
tent
he
was
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
he
was
depressed
over
the
smallness
of
the
french
numbers
and
yet
he
was
elated
by
montcalm
decision
to
stay
at
ticonderoga
and
await
abercrombie
he
was
confident
as
he
had
said
that
some
lucky
chance
would
happen
and
that
the
overwhelming
superiority
of
the
army
would
be
nullified
the
chevalier
cast
a
discriminating
eye
over
the
french
position
the
staunch
battalion
of
berry
lay
near
the
foot
of
lake
george
but
the
greater
part
of
the
army
under
the
direct
command
of
montcalm
was
in
camp
near
a
saw
mill
the
valiant
bourlamaque
was
at
the
head
of
the
portage
and
another
force
held
the
point
of
embarkation
on
lake
george
but
he
knew
that
montcalm
would
change
these
dispositions
when
the
day
of
battle
came
on
the
westward
side
of
the
camp
several
fires
burned
and
dark
figures
lay
near
them
luc
marked
one
of
these
a
gigantic
savage
stretched
at
his
ease
and
he
walked
toward
him
he
pretended
at
first
that
his
errand
had
nothing
to
do
with
tandakora
but
stood
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
for
a
minute
or
two
nor
did
the
ojibway
chief
take
any
notice
he
lay
at
ease
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
thoughts
were
hidden
behind
his
sullen
face
does
tandakora
know
what
the
commander
of
the
french
army
has
decided
to
do
said
luc
at
last
tandakora
is
not
thinking
much
about
it
replied
the
chief
montcalm
is
a
brave
general
he
shows
that
he
is
not
afraid
of
the
great
army
the
english
and
the
bostonnais
have
gathered
he
will
not
retreat
to
crown
point
or
anywhere
else
but
will
stay
at
ticonderoga
and
defeat
his
foes
the
black
eyes
of
the
ojibway
flickered
tandakora
does
not
undertake
to
tell
montcalm
what
he
must
do
he
said
nor
must
montcalm
undertake
to
tell
tandakora
what
he
should
do
what
montcalm
may
do
will
not
now
keep
tandakora
awake
luc
heart
filled
with
hot
anger
but
he
was
used
to
dealing
with
indians
he
understood
their
minds
from
the
inside
and
he
had
a
superb
of
his
own
we
know
that
tandakora
is
a
great
chief
he
said
evenly
we
know
too
that
he
and
his
men
are
as
free
as
the
winds
as
they
blow
where
they
please
so
the
warriors
of
tandakora
go
where
they
wish
but
onontio
the
of
canada
and
tandakora
have
long
been
friends
they
have
been
allies
they
have
fought
side
by
side
in
many
a
battle
if
onontio
falls
tandakora
falls
with
him
if
the
british
and
bostonnais
are
victorious
there
will
be
room
for
none
of
the
tribes
save
the
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
them
tandakora
hates
onontio
will
not
be
able
to
protect
them
any
more
and
they
will
be
driven
from
all
their
hunting
grounds
he
paused
to
watch
his
words
take
effect
and
they
obviously
stirred
the
soul
of
the
savage
chief
who
moved
uneasily
it
is
true
he
said
sharp
sword
never
tells
a
falsehood
if
onontio
is
struck
down
then
the
british
the
bostonnais
and
the
hodenosaunee
triumph
but
my
warriors
bring
me
word
that
our
enemies
have
gathered
the
greatest
force
the
world
has
ever
seen
at
the
head
of
andiatarocte
they
come
thicker
than
the
leaves
of
the
forest
they
have
more
guns
than
we
can
count
they
will
trample
montcalm
and
his
soldiers
under
their
feet
so
according
to
our
custom
tandakora
and
his
warriors
would
go
away
into
the
forest
until
the
british
and
the
bostonnais
scatter
unable
to
find
us
then
when
they
are
not
looking
we
will
strike
them
and
take
many
scalps
tandakora
spoke
in
his
most
impressive
manner
and
when
he
ceased
his
eyes
met
luc
defiantly
again
the
blood
of
the
chevalier
burned
with
wrath
but
as
before
he
restrained
himself
and
his
smooth
voice
gave
no
hint
of
anger
as
he
replied
odds
are
of
no
avail
against
montcalm
the
children
of
onontio
are
used
to
dealing
with
them
remember
tandakora
the
great
victories
montcalm
won
at
oswego
and
william
henry
he
has
the
soul
of
a
mighty
chief
he
has
decided
to
stay
here
at
ticonderoga
and
await
the
enemy
confident
that
he
will
win
the
victory
tandakora
is
a
great
warrior
is
he
willing
to
have
no
share
in
such
a
triumph
the
cruel
eyes
of
the
ojibway
glistened
the
heart
of
tandakora
is
heavy
within
him
he
said
he
and
his
warriors
are
not
afraid
of
the
british
and
the
bostonnais
they
have
fought
by
the
side
of
montcalm
but
they
do
not
receive
all
the
rewards
that
onontio
owes
them
onontio
has
given
to
them
freely
of
his
muskets
and
powder
and
bullets
and
of
his
blankets
and
food
but
he
takes
from
them
the
prisoners
we
have
no
scalps
to
carry
home
it
is
against
the
custom
of
the
french
to
put
prisoners
to
death
or
torture
moreover
we
have
no
prisoners
here
the
rangers
taken
by
langy
have
already
been
sent
to
canada
there
is
one
in
the
camp
now
he
was
captured
by
three
of
my
warriors
those
you
sent
out
and
by
the
law
of
war
he
belongs
to
me
yet
sharp
sword
and
montcalm
hold
him
i
speak
of
the
youth
lennox
the
comrade
of
the
onondaga
tayoga
who
is
my
bitterest
enemy
i
hate
lennox
too
because
he
has
stood
so
often
in
my
way
and
i
demand
him
to
do
with
as
i
please
because
it
is
my
right
the
ojibway
moved
close
to
luc
and
the
fierce
black
eyes
glared
into
those
of
stern
blue
the
chevalier
did
not
change
his
smooth
placatory
tone
as
he
replied
i
can
not
give
up
lennox
it
is
true
that
he
was
taken
by
your
warriors
but
they
were
then
in
my
service
so
he
is
my
prisoner
but
he
is
only
a
single
captive
a
lad
ask
for
some
other
and
greater
reward
tandakora
and
it
shall
be
yours
give
me
the
prisoner
lennox
and
i
and
my
warriors
stay
and
fight
with
you
at
ticonderoga
refuse
him
and
we
go
the
chief
words
were
sharp
and
decisive
and
luc
understood
him
he
knew
that
the
savage
ojibway
hated
young
lennox
intensely
and
would
put
him
to
the
torture
he
never
hesitated
an
instant
i
can
not
yield
the
prisoner
to
you
he
said
the
custom
of
the
french
will
not
permit
it
the
warriors
are
a
great
help
in
battle
and
the
reward
i
ask
is
but
small
luc
knows
that
montcalm
needs
men
here
what
is
this
boy
to
luc
that
he
refuses
so
great
a
price
for
him
it
can
not
be
done
tandakora
i
keep
the
prisoner
lennox
and
later
i
will
send
him
to
canada
to
be
held
there
until
the
war
is
over
then
the
forest
will
swallow
up
tandakora
and
his
warriors
the
chief
returned
to
the
fire
and
lay
at
ease
in
his
blanket
luc
walked
thoughtfully
back
toward
the
tent
of
montcalm
he
knew
that
it
was
his
duty
to
report
the
offer
of
tandakora
to
his
chief
but
he
did
so
reluctantly
you
have
refused
it
already
said
the
marquis
i
have
sir
replied
luc
then
you
have
done
well
i
confirm
you
in
the
refusal
luc
saluted
with
great
respect
and
again
retired
from
the
tent
chapter
xiii
eve
of
battle
robert
awoke
the
next
morning
well
physically
but
depressed
mentally
he
believed
that
a
great
battle
and
a
great
victory
for
the
army
was
coming
and
he
would
have
no
part
in
it
the
losses
of
braddock
defeat
and
the
taking
of
fort
william
henry
by
montcalm
would
be
repaired
once
more
the
flag
of
his
native
land
and
of
his
ancestral
land
would
be
triumphant
but
he
would
be
merely
a
spectator
even
if
he
were
as
much
as
that
it
was
a
bitter
reflection
and
again
he
thought
of
escape
but
no
plan
seemed
possible
he
was
held
as
firmly
in
the
center
of
an
army
as
if
he
were
in
the
jaws
of
a
powerful
vise
nor
was
it
possible
for
tayoga
however
great
his
skill
and
daring
to
reach
him
there
he
strove
to
be
philosophical
but
it
is
hard
for
youth
to
reconcile
itself
at
first
though
it
may
soon
forget
breakfast
was
given
to
him
and
he
was
permitted
to
go
outside
the
tent
into
a
small
open
space
though
not
beyond
on
all
sides
of
him
stretched
the
impassable
lines
of
the
french
army
there
were
several
other
prisoners
within
the
enclosure
a
ranger
a
hunter
and
three
or
four
farmers
who
had
been
taken
in
forays
farther
south
the
fresh
air
and
the
brilliant
sunshine
revived
robert
spirits
he
looked
eagerly
about
him
striving
to
divine
the
french
intentions
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
them
he
knew
however
upon
reflection
that
this
would
be
so
the
french
would
not
put
any
prisoners
in
a
position
to
obtain
information
that
would
be
of
great
value
in
the
possible
event
of
escape
he
undertook
to
talk
with
the
other
prisoners
but
they
were
a
melancholy
lot
not
to
be
cheered
they
were
all
thinking
of
a
long
in
truth
an
indefinite
imprisonment
in
canada
and
they
mourned
many
people
had
been
taken
into
canada
by
french
and
indians
in
former
forays
and
had
been
lost
forever
robert
turned
away
from
his
comrades
and
sat
down
on
a
stone
where
he
speculated
idly
on
what
was
passing
about
him
he
believed
that
the
french
would
withdraw
to
crown
point
at
least
and
might
retreat
all
the
way
to
canada
leaving
lake
champlain
as
well
as
lake
george
to
the
complete
control
of
the
forces
he
expected
to
see
preparations
to
that
effect
and
when
he
saw
none
he
concluded
that
they
were
merely
postponed
for
a
day
or
two
so
far
as
he
could
judge
the
aspect
of
the
french
army
was
leisurely
he
did
not
observe
any
signs
of
trepidation
but
then
withdrawal
was
always
easy
in
the
great
north
american
wilderness
there
was
yet
plenty
of
time
for
it
he
noticed
a
complete
absence
of
indians
and
the
fact
struck
him
with
great
surprise
while
he
was
advancing
various
theories
to
account
for
it
young
captain
louis
de
galissonnière
came
and
greeted
him
cordially
i
hope
you
understand
that
we
french
know
how
to
treat
a
prisoner
he
said
i
nothing
of
which
to
complain
replied
robert
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
been
with
you
and
on
this
occasion
as
on
the
first
i
seem
to
be
more
of
a
guest
than
a
captive
you
the
special
prisoner
of
colonel
de
luc
who
stands
extremely
high
with
the
marquis
de
montcalm
the
colonel
wishes
you
to
be
treated
well
and
seems
to
favor
you
why
is
it
frankly
i
do
know
but
i
learned
long
since
that
he
was
a
most
chivalrous
foe
i
suppose
i
am
to
be
sent
into
canada
along
with
the
other
prisoners
i
suppose
so
but
there
is
no
way
for
you
to
go
just
now
why
ca
i
go
with
your
army
with
our
army
it
retreats
of
course
before
our
overwhelming
force
de
galissonnière
laughed
you
are
disposed
to
be
facetious
he
said
you
will
observe
that
we
are
not
retreating
you
see
no
preparations
to
do
so
but
that
all
i
will
tell
you
more
would
be
valuable
information
for
the
enemy
should
you
escape
i
warned
colonel
de
luc
that
i
mean
to
escape
in
due
time
i
do
like
to
reject
such
noble
hospitality
as
you
showing
me
but
my
duty
to
my
country
demands
it
robert
was
now
in
a
most
excellent
humor
his
sanguine
temperament
was
asserting
itself
to
the
full
what
he
wished
to
see
he
saw
he
was
slipping
away
from
the
french
and
he
was
advancing
with
the
english
and
americans
to
a
great
and
brilliant
victory
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
sparkled
de
galissonnière
looked
at
him
curiously
but
said
nothing
i
observe
one
very
significant
fact
continued
robert
what
is
that
i
see
no
indians
who
are
usually
so
numerous
about
your
camps
you
need
tell
me
what
has
happened
but
i
been
among
indians
a
great
deal
i
know
their
ways
and
i
tell
you
they
see
that
yours
is
a
lost
cause
and
they
deserted
you
now
is
that
so
the
young
frenchman
was
silent
but
it
was
the
turn
of
his
face
to
flush
i
did
expect
you
to
answer
me
in
words
continued
robert
triumphantly
but
i
can
see
the
indians
never
fight
in
a
battle
that
they
consider
lost
before
it
joined
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
captain
de
galissonnière
that
if
the
marquis
de
montcalm
awaits
our
attack
his
army
will
be
destroyed
i
do
not
know
it
at
all
then
robert
felt
ashamed
because
he
had
been
led
away
by
his
enthusiasm
and
apologized
for
a
speech
that
might
have
seemed
boastful
to
the
young
frenchman
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
but
de
galissonnière
with
his
accustomed
courtesy
said
it
was
nothing
and
when
he
left
presently
both
were
in
the
best
of
humors
robert
convinced
that
he
had
been
right
about
the
indians
watched
for
them
as
the
morning
went
on
but
he
never
saw
a
single
warrior
there
could
be
no
doubt
now
that
they
had
gone
and
while
he
could
not
consider
them
chivalric
they
were
at
least
wise
the
next
familiar
face
that
he
beheld
was
one
far
from
welcome
to
him
it
was
that
of
a
man
who
happened
to
pass
near
the
enclosure
and
who
stopped
suddenly
when
he
caught
sight
of
robert
he
was
in
civilian
dress
but
he
was
none
other
than
achille
garay
that
spy
whose
secret
message
had
been
wrested
from
him
in
the
forest
by
robert
and
tayoga
the
gaze
that
garay
bent
upon
robert
was
baleful
his
capture
by
the
three
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
compelled
to
disclose
the
letter
had
been
humiliating
and
robert
did
not
doubt
that
the
man
would
seek
revenge
he
shivered
a
little
feeling
that
as
a
prisoner
he
was
in
a
measure
helpless
then
his
back
stiffened
i
glad
to
see
garay
that
you
where
you
belong
with
the
french
he
called
out
i
hope
you
did
suffer
any
more
from
hunger
in
the
woods
when
willet
the
onondaga
and
i
let
you
go
the
spy
came
closer
and
his
look
was
so
full
of
venom
that
young
lennox
despite
himself
shuddered
time
makes
all
things
even
he
said
i
do
forget
how
you
and
your
friends
held
me
in
your
power
in
the
forest
but
here
you
are
a
prisoner
i
have
a
good
chance
to
make
the
score
even
robert
remembered
also
how
this
man
had
attempted
his
life
in
albany
for
some
reason
that
he
could
not
yet
fathom
and
he
felt
that
he
was
now
and
in
very
truth
a
most
dangerous
enemy
nevertheless
he
replied
quietly
that
was
an
act
of
war
you
were
carrying
a
message
for
the
enemy
we
were
wholly
within
our
rights
when
we
forced
you
to
disclose
the
paper
it
makes
no
difference
said
garay
i
owe
you
and
your
comrades
a
debt
and
i
shall
pay
it
robert
turned
his
back
on
him
and
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
enclosure
when
he
turned
around
five
minutes
later
garay
was
gone
but
robert
felt
uncomfortable
here
was
a
man
who
did
not
have
the
gallantry
and
chivalry
that
marked
so
many
of
the
french
if
he
could
he
would
strike
some
great
blow
he
strove
to
dismiss
garay
from
his
mind
and
in
his
interest
in
what
was
going
on
about
him
he
finally
succeeded
he
saw
frenchmen
and
canadians
leaving
the
camp
and
others
returning
his
knowledge
of
war
made
him
believe
that
those
coming
had
been
messengers
sent
forth
to
watch
the
army
and
those
going
were
dispatched
on
the
same
service
their
alarm
must
be
great
he
reflected
pleasantly
and
none
could
bring
to
montcalm
any
reassuring
news
once
he
saw
montcalm
and
once
luc
but
neither
spoke
to
him
he
and
his
comrades
the
other
prisoners
slept
that
night
in
the
open
the
weather
being
warm
a
blanket
was
allotted
to
every
one
by
their
captors
and
robert
long
used
to
unlimited
fresh
air
preferred
the
outside
to
the
inside
of
a
tent
nothing
disturbed
his
slumbers
but
he
expected
that
the
french
retreat
would
begin
the
next
day
on
the
contrary
montcalm
stayed
in
his
camp
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
withdrawal
on
the
second
and
third
days
or
on
others
that
came
he
inferred
then
that
the
advance
of
abercrombie
had
been
delayed
and
the
french
were
merely
hanging
on
until
their
retreat
became
compulsory
he
had
been
in
the
camp
about
a
week
and
as
he
saw
no
more
of
garay
he
concluded
that
the
man
had
been
sent
away
on
some
errand
it
was
highly
probable
that
he
was
now
in
the
south
spying
upon
the
army
it
was
for
just
such
duties
that
he
was
fitted
then
he
began
to
think
of
him
less
and
less
his
old
impatience
and
keen
disappointment
because
he
was
a
prisoner
when
such
great
days
were
coming
returned
with
doubled
vigor
he
chafed
greatly
and
looked
around
again
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
but
did
not
see
the
remotest
possibility
of
it
after
all
he
must
reconcile
himself
his
situation
could
be
far
worse
he
was
well
treated
and
some
of
the
french
leaders
while
official
enemies
were
personal
friends
his
mind
also
dwelled
upon
the
singular
fact
that
the
french
army
did
not
retreat
he
tried
to
glean
something
from
de
galissonnière
who
talked
with
him
several
times
but
the
young
captain
would
not
depart
from
generalities
he
invariably
shut
up
tight
when
they
approached
any
detail
of
the
present
military
situation
a
dark
night
came
with
much
wind
and
threat
of
rain
robert
thought
that
he
and
his
fellow
captives
would
have
to
ask
the
shelter
of
tents
but
the
rain
passed
farther
to
the
west
though
the
heavy
darkness
remained
he
was
glad
as
the
weather
was
now
oppressively
warm
and
he
greatly
preferred
to
sleep
on
a
blanket
in
the
open
air
the
night
was
somewhat
advanced
when
he
lay
down
the
other
prisoners
were
asleep
already
he
had
not
found
any
kindred
minds
among
them
and
as
they
were
apathetic
he
had
not
talked
with
them
much
now
he
did
not
miss
them
at
all
as
he
lay
on
his
blanket
and
watched
the
wavering
lights
of
the
camp
it
was
still
quite
dark
with
a
moaning
wind
but
his
experience
of
weather
told
him
that
the
chance
of
rain
was
gone
far
in
the
west
lightning
flickered
and
low
thunder
grumbled
there
now
and
then
but
in
the
camp
everything
was
dry
owing
to
the
warmth
the
fires
used
for
cooking
had
been
permitted
to
burn
out
and
the
whole
army
seemed
at
peace
robert
himself
shared
this
feeling
of
rest
the
storm
passing
so
far
away
soothed
and
lulled
him
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
there
unharmed
and
witness
its
course
at
a
far
point
he
dozed
a
while
fell
asleep
and
awoke
again
in
half
an
hour
nothing
had
changed
there
was
still
an
occasional
flicker
of
lightning
and
mutter
of
thunder
and
the
darkness
remained
heavy
he
could
dimly
see
the
forms
of
his
comrades
lying
on
their
blankets
not
one
of
them
stirred
they
slept
heavily
and
he
rather
envied
them
they
had
little
imagination
and
when
one
was
in
bad
case
he
was
lucky
to
be
without
it
the
figure
lying
nearest
him
he
took
to
be
that
of
the
hunter
a
taciturn
man
who
talked
least
of
them
all
and
again
robert
felt
envy
because
he
could
lose
all
care
so
thoroughly
and
so
easily
in
sleep
the
man
was
as
still
and
unconcerned
as
one
of
the
mountain
peaks
that
looked
down
upon
them
he
would
imitate
him
and
although
sleep
might
be
unwilling
he
would
conquer
it
a
resolute
mind
could
triumph
over
anything
he
shut
his
eyes
and
his
will
was
so
strong
that
he
held
them
shut
a
full
ten
minutes
although
sleep
did
not
come
when
he
opened
them
again
he
thought
that
the
hunter
had
moved
a
little
after
all
the
man
was
mortal
and
had
human
emotions
he
was
not
an
absolute
log
tilden
he
called
tilden
was
the
hunter
name
but
tilden
did
not
stir
nor
did
he
respond
in
any
way
when
he
called
a
second
time
he
had
been
mistaken
he
had
given
the
man
too
much
credit
he
was
really
a
log
a
dull
apathetic
fellow
to
whom
the
extraordinary
conditions
around
them
made
no
appeal
he
would
not
speak
to
him
again
as
long
as
they
were
prisoners
together
and
closing
his
eyes
anew
he
resolutely
wooed
slumber
once
more
robert
hearing
was
not
so
wonderfully
keen
as
tayoga
but
it
was
very
keen
nevertheless
and
as
he
lay
eyes
shut
something
impinged
upon
the
drums
of
his
ears
it
was
faint
but
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
part
of
the
usual
sounds
of
the
night
his
ear
at
once
registered
an
alarm
on
his
brain
his
eyes
opened
the
man
whom
he
had
taken
to
be
the
hunter
was
bending
over
him
and
dark
though
it
was
he
distinctly
saw
the
gleam
of
a
knife
in
his
hand
his
first
feeling
passing
in
a
flash
was
one
of
vague
wonderment
that
anybody
should
menace
him
in
such
a
manner
and
then
he
saw
the
lowering
face
of
garay
he
had
been
a
fool
to
forget
him
with
a
convulsive
and
powerful
effort
he
threw
his
body
to
one
side
and
when
the
knife
fell
the
blade
missed
him
by
an
inch
then
robert
sprang
to
his
feet
but
garay
uttering
an
angry
exclamation
at
his
missed
stroke
did
not
attempt
another
instead
agile
as
a
cat
he
ran
lightly
away
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
camp
robert
sat
down
somewhat
dazed
it
had
all
been
an
affair
of
a
minute
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
real
his
comrades
still
slept
soundly
and
the
camp
seemed
as
peaceful
as
ever
for
a
time
robert
could
not
decide
what
to
do
he
knew
that
he
had
been
threatened
by
a
formidable
danger
and
that
instinct
more
than
anything
else
had
saved
him
he
was
almost
prepared
to
believe
that
tayoga
tododaho
looking
down
from
his
remote
star
had
intervened
in
his
behalf
the
question
solved
itself
although
he
knew
that
garay
had
made
a
foul
attempt
upon
his
life
he
had
no
proof
his
story
would
seem
highly
improbable
moreover
he
was
a
prisoner
while
garay
was
one
of
the
french
nobody
would
believe
his
tale
he
must
keep
quiet
and
watch
he
was
glad
to
see
that
the
night
was
now
lightening
garay
would
not
come
back
then
at
least
but
robert
was
sure
that
he
would
repeat
the
attack
some
time
or
other
revenge
was
a
powerful
motive
and
he
undoubtedly
had
another
as
strong
he
must
guard
against
garay
with
all
his
five
senses
the
night
continued
to
brighten
the
lightning
ceased
to
flicker
the
storm
had
blown
itself
out
in
the
distance
and
a
fine
moon
and
a
myriad
of
stars
came
out
things
in
the
camp
became
clearly
visible
and
feeling
that
garay
would
attempt
nothing
more
at
such
a
time
robert
closed
his
eyes
again
he
soon
slept
and
did
not
awaken
until
all
the
other
prisoners
were
up
tilden
he
said
to
the
hunter
i
offer
you
my
sincere
apologies
apologies
said
the
hunter
in
surprise
what
for
because
i
mistook
a
much
worse
man
for
you
you
did
know
anything
about
it
at
the
time
but
i
did
it
and
i
sorry
i
wronged
you
so
much
even
in
thought
the
hunter
touched
his
forehead
clearly
the
misfortunes
of
the
young
prisoner
were
weighing
too
heavily
upon
him
one
must
endure
captivity
better
than
that
do
take
it
so
hard
lennox
he
said
it
not
like
being
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
and
there
is
always
the
chance
of
escape
de
galissonnière
visited
him
again
that
morning
and
robert
true
to
his
resolution
said
nothing
of
garay
the
captain
did
not
speak
of
the
army
but
robert
judged
from
his
manner
that
he
was
highly
expectant
surely
abercrombie
was
about
to
advance
and
the
retreat
of
montcalm
could
not
be
more
than
a
day
away
de
galissonnière
stayed
only
ten
minutes
and
then
robert
was
left
to
his
own
devices
he
tried
to
talk
to
tilden
but
the
hunter
lapsed
again
into
an
apathetic
state
and
having
little
success
he
fell
back
on
his
own
thoughts
and
what
his
eyes
might
behold
in
the
afternoon
he
saw
montcalm
at
some
distance
talking
with
luc
and
bourlamaque
and
then
he
saw
a
man
whose
appearance
betokened
haste
and
anxiety
approach
them
robert
did
not
know
it
then
but
it
was
the
able
and
daring
french
partisan
langy
and
he
came
out
of
the
forest
with
vital
news
meanwhile
langy
saluted
montcalm
with
the
great
respect
that
his
successes
had
won
from
all
the
french
when
the
marquis
turned
his
keen
eye
upon
him
he
knew
at
once
that
his
message
whatever
it
might
be
was
of
supreme
importance
what
is
it
monsieur
langy
a
report
on
the
movements
of
the
enemy
come
to
my
tent
and
tell
me
of
it
fully
and
do
you
luc
and
bourlamaque
come
with
me
also
you
should
hear
everything
they
went
into
the
tent
and
all
sat
down
luc
eyes
never
left
the
partisan
langy
he
saw
that
the
man
was
full
of
his
news
eager
to
tell
it
and
was
impressed
with
its
importance
he
knew
langy
even
better
than
montcalm
did
few
were
more
skillful
in
the
forest
and
he
had
a
true
sense
of
proportion
that
did
not
desert
him
under
stress
his
eyes
traveled
over
the
partisan
attire
and
there
his
own
great
skill
as
a
ranger
told
him
much
his
garments
were
disarranged
burrs
and
one
or
two
little
twigs
were
clinging
to
them
obviously
he
had
come
far
and
in
haste
the
thoughts
of
luc
and
in
truth
the
thoughts
of
all
of
them
went
to
the
army
speak
monsieur
langy
said
montcalm
i
can
see
that
you
have
come
swiftly
and
you
would
not
come
so
without
due
cause
i
wish
to
report
to
you
sir
said
langy
that
the
entire
army
of
the
enemy
is
now
embarked
on
the
lake
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
is
advancing
against
us
montcalm
eyes
sparkled
his
warlike
soul
leaped
up
at
the
thought
of
speedy
battle
that
was
being
offered
a
flame
was
lighted
also
in
luc
blood
and
bourlamaque
was
no
less
eager
it
was
no
lack
of
valor
and
enterprise
that
caused
the
french
to
lose
their
colonies
in
north
america
you
know
this
positively
asked
the
i
have
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
tell
it
as
you
saw
it
i
lay
in
the
woods
above
the
lake
with
my
men
and
i
saw
the
british
and
americans
go
into
their
boats
a
vast
flock
of
them
they
are
all
afloat
on
the
lake
at
this
moment
and
are
coming
against
us
could
you
make
a
fair
estimate
of
their
numbers
i
obtained
the
figures
with
much
exactitude
from
one
or
two
stragglers
that
we
captured
on
the
land
my
eyes
confirm
these
figures
there
are
about
seven
thousand
of
the
english
regulars
and
about
nine
thousand
of
the
american
colonials
so
many
as
that
five
to
one
you
tell
us
they
are
all
in
boats
said
luc
how
many
of
these
boats
contain
their
artillery
they
have
not
yet
embarked
the
cannon
as
nearly
as
we
can
gather
the
guns
will
not
come
until
the
army
is
at
ticonderoga
what
it
is
as
i
tell
you
replied
langy
to
luc
the
guns
can
not
come
up
the
lake
until
a
day
or
two
after
the
army
is
landed
their
force
is
so
great
that
they
do
not
seem
to
think
they
will
need
the
artillery
luc
his
face
glowing
turned
to
montcalm
sir
he
said
i
made
to
you
the
prophecy
that
some
chance
some
glorious
chance
would
yet
help
us
and
that
chance
has
come
their
very
strength
has
betrayed
them
into
an
error
that
may
prove
fatal
despising
us
they
give
us
our
opportunity
no
matter
how
great
the
odds
we
can
hold
earthworks
and
abattis
against
them
unless
they
bring
cannon
or
at
least
we
may
make
a
great
attempt
at
it
the
swarthy
face
of
montcalm
was
illumined
by
the
light
from
his
eyes
i
verily
believe
that
your
gallant
soul
speaks
truth
chevalier
de
st
luc
he
exclaimed
i
said
once
that
we
would
stand
and
i
say
it
again
we
put
all
to
the
hazard
since
they
come
without
cannon
we
do
have
our
chance
go
langy
and
take
your
needed
rest
you
have
served
us
well
and
now
we
have
the
others
here
and
talk
over
our
preparations
the
engineers
lotbiniére
and
le
mercier
were
as
before
zealous
for
battle
at
ticonderoga
and
their
opinion
counted
for
much
with
montcalm
de
levis
held
back
by
the
vacillating
vaudreuil
had
not
yet
come
from
montreal
and
the
swiftest
of
the
canadian
paddlers
was
sent
down
lake
ticonderoga
in
a
canoe
to
hurry
him
on
then
the
entire
battalion
of
berry
went
to
work
at
once
with
spade
and
pick
and
ax
to
prepare
a
breastwork
and
abattis
stretching
a
line
of
defense
in
front
of
the
fort
and
not
using
the
fort
itself
robert
saw
the
frenchmen
attack
the
trees
with
their
axes
and
the
earth
with
their
spades
and
he
divined
at
once
the
news
that
langy
had
brought
the
army
was
advancing
his
heart
throbbed
victory
and
rescue
were
at
hand
tilden
he
said
to
the
hunter
listen
to
the
ring
of
the
ax
and
the
thud
of
the
spade
aye
i
hear
was
the
apathetic
reply
but
they
do
interest
me
i
a
prisoner
but
it
may
mean
that
you
wo
be
a
prisoner
much
longer
the
french
are
fortifying
and
they
gone
to
work
with
so
much
haste
and
energy
that
it
shows
an
imminent
need
there
only
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
it
they
expecting
our
army
and
a
prompt
attack
tilden
began
to
show
interest
on
my
life
i
think
you
right
he
said
and
yet
montcalm
changed
his
mind
again
at
the
last
moment
two
veteran
officers
montguy
and
bernès
pointed
out
to
him
that
his
present
position
was
dominated
by
the
adjacent
heights
and
in
order
to
escape
that
danger
he
resolved
to
retreat
a
little
he
broke
up
his
camp
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
part
of
the
army
fell
back
through
the
woods
more
than
a
mile
and
the
rest
of
it
withdrew
in
boats
on
the
lake
to
the
same
point
robert
and
his
comrades
were
carried
with
the
army
on
land
to
the
fort
there
he
became
separated
from
the
others
and
remained
in
the
rear
but
luckily
for
his
wishes
on
a
mount
where
he
could
see
most
that
was
passing
though
his
chance
of
escape
was
as
remote
as
ever
he
stood
on
the
rocky
peninsula
of
ticonderoga
behind
him
the
great
lake
champlain
stretched
far
into
north
and
south
to
the
west
the
ground
sloped
gently
upward
a
half
mile
and
then
sank
again
on
each
side
of
the
ridge
formed
thus
was
low
ground
and
the
ridge
presented
itself
at
once
to
the
military
eye
as
a
line
of
defense
hugues
one
of
his
officers
had
already
recommended
it
to
montcalm
and
men
under
two
of
his
engineers
desandrouin
and
pontleroy
were
now
at
work
there
the
final
line
of
defense
was
begun
at
dawn
and
robert
whom
no
one
disturbed
witnessed
a
scene
of
prodigious
energy
the
whole
french
army
threw
itself
heart
and
soul
into
the
task
the
men
hot
under
the
july
sun
threw
aside
their
coats
and
the
officers
putting
their
own
hands
to
the
work
did
likewise
there
was
a
continuous
ring
of
axes
and
the
air
resounded
with
the
crash
of
trees
falling
in
hundreds
and
thousands
the
tops
and
ends
of
the
boughs
were
cut
off
the
trees
the
ends
left
thus
were
sharpened
and
the
trees
were
piled
upon
one
another
with
the
sharp
ends
facing
the
enemy
who
was
to
come
robert
watched
as
these
bristling
rows
grew
to
a
height
of
at
least
nine
feet
and
then
he
saw
the
men
build
on
the
inner
side
platforms
on
which
they
could
stand
and
fire
over
the
crest
without
exposing
anything
except
their
heads
in
front
of
the
abattis
more
trees
with
sharpened
boughs
were
spread
for
a
wide
space
the
whole
field
with
its
stumps
and
trees
looking
as
if
a
mighty
hurricane
had
swept
over
it
robert
was
soldier
enough
to
see
what
a
formidable
obstruction
was
being
raised
but
he
thought
the
powerful
artillery
of
the
attacking
army
would
sweep
it
away
or
level
it
he
did
not
know
that
the
big
guns
were
being
left
behind
in
truth
langy
first
news
that
the
cannon
would
not
be
embarked
upon
the
lake
was
partly
wrong
the
loading
of
the
cannon
was
delayed
but
after
the
british
and
americans
reached
their
landing
and
began
the
march
across
country
for
the
attack
the
guns
although
brought
down
the
lake
were
left
behind
as
not
needed
but
the
french
knew
all
these
movements
and
whether
the
cannon
were
left
at
one
point
or
another
it
was
just
the
same
to
them
so
long
as
they
were
not
used
in
the
assault
robert
intense
mortification
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
lie
idle
and
witness
the
efforts
of
his
enemies
returned
but
no
matter
how
he
chafed
he
could
see
no
way
out
of
it
then
his
absorption
in
what
was
going
on
about
him
made
him
forget
his
personal
fortunes
the
setting
for
the
great
drama
was
wild
and
picturesque
in
the
extreme
on
one
side
stretched
the
long
gleaming
lake
a
lake
of
wildness
and
beauty
associated
with
so
much
of
romance
and
peril
in
american
story
over
them
towered
the
crest
of
the
peak
later
known
as
defiance
to
the
south
and
west
was
lake
george
the
iroquois
andiatarocte
that
gem
of
the
east
and
on
all
sides
save
champlain
circled
the
forest
just
beginning
to
wither
under
the
fierce
summer
sun
the
energy
of
the
french
did
not
diminish
stronger
and
stronger
grew
abattis
and
breastwork
the
whole
becoming
a
formidable
field
over
which
men
might
charge
to
death
but
robert
only
smiled
to
himself
abercrombie
mighty
array
of
cannon
would
smash
everything
and
then
the
brave
infantry
charging
through
the
gaps
would
destroy
the
french
army
the
french
he
knew
were
brave
and
skillful
but
their
doom
was
sure
once
luc
spoke
to
him
the
chevalier
had
thrown
off
his
coat
also
and
he
had
swung
an
ax
with
the
best
i
am
sorry
lennox
he
said
that
we
have
not
had
time
to
send
you
away
but
as
you
can
see
our
operations
are
somewhat
hurried
chance
put
you
here
and
here
you
will
have
to
stay
until
all
is
over
i
see
that
you
are
expecting
an
army
said
robert
and
i
infer
from
all
these
preparations
that
it
will
soon
be
upon
you
it
is
betraying
no
military
secret
to
admit
that
it
is
even
so
abercrombie
will
soon
be
at
hand
and
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
await
him
i
judge
that
he
has
sufficient
force
to
overwhelm
you
we
are
never
beaten
before
battle
the
marquis
de
montcalm
would
not
stay
unless
he
had
a
fair
chance
of
success
robert
was
silent
and
luc
quickly
went
back
to
his
work
all
day
the
men
toiled
and
when
the
sun
went
down
they
were
still
at
their
task
the
ring
of
axes
and
the
crash
of
falling
trees
resounded
through
the
dark
part
of
the
soldiers
put
their
kettles
and
pots
on
the
fires
but
the
others
labored
on
in
the
night
came
the
valiant
de
levis
with
his
men
and
montcalm
gave
him
a
heartfelt
welcome
de
levis
was
a
host
in
himself
and
montcalm
felt
that
he
was
just
in
time
he
expected
the
battle
on
the
morrow
his
scouts
told
him
that
abercrombie
would
be
at
hand
but
without
his
artillery
the
marquis
looked
at
the
formidable
abattis
the
rows
and
rows
of
trees
presenting
their
myriad
of
spiked
ends
and
hope
was
alive
in
his
heart
he
regretted
once
more
the
absence
of
the
indians
who
had
been
led
away
by
the
sulky
tandakora
but
victory
won
with
their
help
demanded
a
fearful
price
as
he
had
learned
at
william
henry
montcalm
luc
de
levis
bourlamaque
lotbiniére
and
other
trusted
officers
held
a
consultation
far
in
the
night
an
important
event
had
occurred
already
a
scouting
force
of
french
and
canadians
under
trepezec
and
langy
had
been
trapped
by
rangers
under
rogers
and
troops
under
fitch
and
lyman
the
french
and
canadians
were
cut
to
pieces
but
in
the
battle
the
gallant
young
lord
howe
the
real
leader
of
the
army
had
been
killed
he
had
gone
forward
with
the
vanguard
exposing
himself
rashly
perhaps
and
his
life
was
the
forfeit
immediate
confusion
in
the
councils
followed
and
montcalm
and
his
lieutenants
had
noticed
the
lack
of
precision
and
directness
robert
did
not
see
the
french
officers
going
to
the
council
but
he
knew
that
the
french
army
meant
to
stay
even
while
the
men
were
cutting
down
the
trees
he
could
not
persuade
himself
wholly
that
montcalm
would
fight
there
at
ticonderoga
but
as
the
night
advanced
his
last
faint
doubt
disappeared
he
would
certainly
witness
a
great
battle
on
the
morrow
he
could
not
sleep
every
nerve
in
him
seemed
to
be
alive
one
vivid
picture
after
another
floated
before
his
mind
the
lake
behind
him
grew
dim
before
him
were
the
camp
fires
of
the
french
the
wooden
wall
the
dark
line
of
the
forest
and
hills
and
the
crest
of
defiance
looking
solemnly
down
on
them
although
held
firmly
there
within
lines
which
one
could
not
pass
nobody
seemed
to
take
any
notice
of
him
he
could
rest
or
watch
as
he
chose
and
he
had
no
choice
but
to
watch
he
saw
the
french
lie
down
on
their
arms
save
for
the
numerous
sentinels
posted
everywhere
and
after
a
while
though
most
of
the
night
was
gone
the
ring
of
axes
and
the
fall
of
trees
ceased
there
was
a
hum
of
voices
but
that
too
died
in
time
and
long
after
midnight
with
his
back
against
a
tree
he
dozed
a
little
while
he
was
awakened
by
a
premonition
a
warning
out
of
the
dark
and
opening
his
eyes
he
saw
garay
slinking
near
he
did
not
know
whether
the
spy
meant
another
attempt
upon
his
life
but
standing
up
he
stared
at
him
intently
garay
shrank
away
and
disappeared
in
the
further
ranges
of
the
camp
robert
somehow
was
not
afraid
the
man
would
not
make
such
a
trial
again
at
so
great
a
risk
and
his
mind
turned
back
to
its
preoccupation
the
great
battle
that
was
coming
near
morning
he
dozed
again
for
an
hour
or
so
but
he
awoke
before
the
summer
dawn
all
his
faculties
were
alive
and
his
body
attuned
when
he
saw
the
sun
rise
bringing
with
it
the
momentous
day
chapter
xiv
ticonderoga
the
french
army
rose
with
the
sun
the
drums
beating
the
call
to
battle
montcalm
stationed
the
battalions
of
languedoc
and
la
sarre
on
the
left
with
bourlamaque
to
command
them
on
the
right
de
levis
led
the
battalions
of
béarn
guienne
and
la
reine
montcalm
himself
stood
with
the
battalion
of
royal
roussillon
in
the
center
and
luc
was
by
his
side
volunteers
held
the
sunken
ground
between
the
breastwork
and
the
outlet
of
lake
george
a
strong
force
of
regulars
and
canadians
was
on
the
side
of
lake
champlain
under
the
guns
of
the
fort
there
then
having
taken
their
places
all
the
parts
of
the
army
went
to
work
again
strengthening
the
defenses
with
ax
and
spade
improving
every
moment
that
might
be
left
all
thought
of
escape
left
robert
mind
in
the
mighty
and
thrilling
drama
that
was
about
to
be
played
before
him
once
more
he
stared
at
the
long
line
of
the
lake
and
then
his
whole
attention
was
for
the
circling
forest
and
the
hills
that
was
where
the
army
of
his
country
lay
nothing
was
to
be
expected
from
the
lake
victory
would
come
from
the
woods
and
he
looked
so
long
at
the
trees
that
they
blurred
together
into
one
mass
he
knew
that
the
english
and
americans
were
near
but
just
how
near
he
could
not
gather
from
those
around
him
he
brushed
his
eyes
to
clear
them
and
continued
to
study
the
forest
the
sun
great
and
brilliant
was
flooding
it
with
light
gilding
the
slopes
and
crests
of
defiance
and
tinging
the
green
of
the
leaves
with
gold
nothing
stirred
there
the
wilderness
seemed
silent
as
if
men
never
fought
in
its
depths
time
went
slowly
on
after
all
the
army
might
not
advance
to
the
attack
that
day
if
so
his
disappointment
would
be
bitter
he
wanted
a
great
victory
and
he
wanted
it
at
once
his
eyes
suddenly
caught
a
gleam
on
the
crest
of
defiance
a
bit
of
red
flashed
among
the
trees
he
thought
it
was
the
uniform
of
a
british
soldier
and
his
heart
beat
hard
the
army
was
surely
advancing
the
attack
would
be
made
and
the
victory
would
be
won
that
day
not
on
the
morrow
nor
next
week
but
before
the
sun
set
the
blood
pounded
in
his
temples
he
looked
at
the
french
they
too
had
seen
the
scarlet
gleam
on
defiance
and
they
were
watching
montcalm
and
luc
began
to
talk
together
earnestly
de
levis
and
bourlamaque
walked
back
and
forth
among
their
troops
but
their
gaze
was
upon
the
crest
the
men
lay
down
ax
and
spade
for
the
time
and
reached
for
their
arms
robert
saw
the
sunlight
glittering
on
musket
and
bayonet
and
once
more
he
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
the
great
drama
on
which
the
curtain
was
now
rising
another
scarlet
patch
appeared
on
the
crest
and
then
more
he
knew
that
the
scouts
and
skirmishers
were
there
doubtless
in
strong
force
it
was
likely
that
the
rangers
who
would
be
in
forest
green
were
more
numerous
than
the
english
and
the
attack
could
not
now
be
far
away
a
sharp
crack
a
puff
of
white
smoke
on
the
hill
and
the
first
shot
of
ticonderoga
was
fired
then
came
a
volley
but
the
french
made
no
reply
none
of
the
bullets
had
reached
them
robert
did
not
know
it
then
but
the
gleam
came
from
the
red
blankets
of
iroquois
indians
the
allies
of
the
english
and
not
from
english
uniforms
they
kept
up
a
vigorous
but
harmless
fire
for
a
short
while
and
then
drew
off
silence
descended
once
more
on
the
forest
and
robert
was
puzzled
it
could
not
be
possible
that
this
was
to
be
the
only
attack
the
smoke
of
the
rifles
was
already
drifting
away
from
the
crest
gone
like
summer
vapor
the
french
were
returning
to
their
work
with
ax
and
spade
the
forest
covered
and
enclosed
everything
no
sound
came
from
it
montcalm
and
luc
walking
up
and
down
began
to
talk
together
again
they
looked
no
longer
toward
the
crest
of
defiance
but
watched
the
southern
wilderness
the
work
with
the
ax
increased
montcalm
had
no
mind
to
lose
the
precious
hours
more
trees
fell
fast
and
they
were
added
to
the
formidable
works
the
sun
grew
hotter
and
poured
down
sheaves
of
fiery
rays
but
the
toilers
disregarded
it
swinging
the
axes
with
muscles
that
took
no
note
of
weariness
robert
thought
the
morning
would
last
forever
an
hour
before
noon
de
galissonnière
was
passing
and
noticing
him
sitting
on
a
low
mound
he
said
i
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
you
lennox
but
i
see
that
you
like
ourselves
await
the
battle
so
i
do
said
robert
as
lightly
as
he
could
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
somewhat
delayed
not
our
fault
i
assure
you
perhaps
you
did
think
so
earlier
but
you
see
we
willing
to
fight
no
matter
how
great
the
odds
i
admit
it
the
marquis
de
montcalm
has
his
courage
perhaps
too
much
de
galissonnière
glanced
at
the
strong
works
and
his
smile
was
confident
but
he
merely
said
it
is
for
the
future
to
tell
then
he
went
on
and
robert
hoped
that
whatever
happened
the
battle
would
spare
the
young
frenchman
up
went
the
sun
toward
the
zenith
a
light
wind
rustled
the
foliage
noon
was
near
and
he
began
to
wonder
anew
what
had
become
of
the
advancing
army
suddenly
the
echo
of
a
crash
came
out
of
the
forest
in
front
he
stood
erect
listening
intently
and
the
sound
rose
again
but
it
was
not
an
echo
now
it
was
real
and
he
knew
that
the
battle
was
at
hand
the
crashes
became
continuous
mingled
with
them
were
shouts
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
began
to
float
above
the
trees
the
french
fired
a
cannon
as
a
signal
and
before
the
echoes
of
its
report
rolled
away
every
man
dropped
ax
or
spade
and
was
in
his
place
weapon
in
hand
the
noise
of
the
firing
in
front
grew
fast
montcalm
scouts
and
pickets
were
driven
in
and
the
soldiers
of
the
advancing
army
began
to
show
among
the
trees
the
french
batteries
opened
the
roar
in
robert
ear
was
terrific
but
he
stood
at
his
utmost
height
in
order
that
he
might
see
the
assault
his
eyes
caught
the
gleam
of
uniforms
and
the
flash
of
sunlight
on
bayonet
and
rifle
he
knew
now
that
his
own
people
dauntless
and
tenacious
were
coming
he
did
not
know
that
they
had
left
their
artillery
behind
and
that
they
expected
to
destroy
the
french
army
with
bayonet
and
rifle
and
musket
the
fire
from
the
french
barrier
increased
in
volume
its
crash
beat
heavily
and
continuously
on
the
drums
of
robert
ears
a
deadly
sleet
was
beating
upon
the
advancing
english
and
americans
already
their
dead
were
heaping
up
in
rows
montcalm
men
showed
their
heads
only
above
their
works
their
bodies
were
sheltered
by
the
logs
and
they
fired
and
fired
into
the
charging
masses
until
the
barrels
of
rifles
and
muskets
grew
too
hot
for
them
to
hold
meanwhile
they
shouted
with
all
their
might
vive
la
france
vive
notre
general
vive
le
roi
and
luc
who
stood
always
with
montcalm
hummed
softly
and
under
his
breath
hier
sur
le
pont
oui
chanter
la
belle
it
goes
well
he
said
to
montcalm
aye
a
fair
beginning
replied
the
marquis
fire
ran
through
french
veins
no
cannon
balls
were
coming
from
the
enemy
to
sweep
down
their
defenses
bullets
from
rifle
and
musket
were
beating
in
vain
on
their
wooden
wall
and
before
them
came
the
foe
a
vast
converging
mass
a
target
that
no
one
could
miss
they
were
far
from
their
own
land
deep
in
the
great
north
american
wilderness
but
as
they
saw
it
they
fought
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
france
and
to
keep
what
was
hers
they
redoubled
their
shouts
and
fired
faster
and
faster
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
rose
over
the
clearing
and
the
forest
but
through
it
the
attacking
army
always
advanced
a
hedge
of
bayonets
leading
robert
saw
everything
clearly
his
heart
sank
for
a
moment
and
then
leaped
up
again
many
of
his
own
had
fallen
but
a
great
red
curve
was
advancing
it
was
the
british
regulars
the
best
troops
in
the
charge
that
europe
could
furnish
and
they
would
surely
carry
the
wooden
wall
as
far
as
he
could
see
in
front
and
to
left
and
right
their
bayonets
flashed
in
the
sun
and
a
cry
of
admiration
sprang
to
his
lips
forward
they
came
their
line
even
and
beautiful
and
then
the
tempest
beat
upon
them
the
entire
french
fire
was
concentrated
upon
the
concave
red
lines
the
batteries
poured
grape
shot
upon
them
and
a
sleet
of
lead
cut
through
flesh
and
bone
gaps
were
torn
in
their
ranks
but
the
others
closed
up
and
came
on
the
american
colonials
on
their
flanks
charging
as
bravely
robert
suddenly
remembered
a
vision
of
his
vague
and
fleeting
then
but
very
real
now
he
was
standing
here
at
ticonderoga
looking
at
the
battle
as
it
passed
before
him
and
now
it
was
no
vision
but
the
truth
had
tayoga
manitou
opened
the
future
to
him
for
a
moment
then
the
memory
was
gone
and
the
terrific
drama
of
the
present
claimed
his
whole
mind
the
red
lines
were
not
stopped
in
the
face
of
awful
losses
they
were
still
coming
they
were
among
the
trees
where
the
men
were
entangled
with
the
boughs
or
ran
upon
the
wooden
spikes
often
they
tripped
and
fell
but
rising
they
returned
to
the
charge
offering
their
breasts
to
the
deadly
storm
that
never
diminished
for
an
instant
robert
walked
back
and
forth
in
his
little
space
every
nerve
was
on
edge
the
smoke
of
the
firing
was
in
eye
throat
and
nostril
and
his
brain
was
hot
but
confidence
was
again
supreme
they
come
they
come
nothing
can
stop
them
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
now
the
colonials
on
the
flank
pressed
forward
and
they
also
advanced
through
the
lines
of
the
regulars
in
front
and
charged
with
them
together
british
and
americans
climbed
over
the
mass
of
fallen
trees
in
face
of
the
terrible
fire
and
reached
the
wooden
wall
itself
where
the
sleet
beat
directly
upon
their
faces
for
a
long
distance
behind
them
their
dead
and
wounded
lay
in
hundreds
and
hundreds
many
of
them
tried
to
scale
the
barrier
but
were
beaten
back
now
montcalm
luc
de
levis
bourlamaque
and
all
the
french
leaders
made
their
mightiest
efforts
the
eye
of
the
french
commander
swept
the
field
he
neglected
nothing
never
was
a
man
better
served
by
his
lieutenants
luc
was
at
every
threatened
point
encouraging
with
voice
and
example
bourlamaque
received
a
dangerous
wound
but
refused
to
quit
the
field
bougainville
was
hit
but
his
hurt
was
less
severe
and
he
took
no
notice
of
it
two
bullets
pierced
the
hat
of
de
levis
luc
took
a
half
dozen
through
his
clothes
and
his
body
was
grazed
three
times
but
his
gay
and
warlike
spirit
mounted
steadily
and
he
hummed
his
little
french
air
over
and
over
again
more
british
and
americans
pressed
to
the
wooden
wall
the
new
black
watch
stalwart
scotchmen
bagpipes
playing
charged
over
everything
two
british
columns
made
a
powerful
and
tremendous
attack
upon
the
french
right
where
stood
the
valiant
battalions
of
béarn
and
guienne
it
seemed
for
a
while
that
they
might
overwhelm
everything
they
were
against
the
barrier
itself
and
were
firing
into
the
defense
montcalm
rushed
to
the
spot
with
all
the
reserves
he
could
muster
luc
sprang
among
the
men
and
shouted
to
them
to
increase
their
fire
this
point
became
the
center
of
the
battle
and
its
full
fury
was
concentrated
there
a
mass
of
highlanders
tearing
at
the
wooden
wall
refused
to
give
back
though
they
fell
fast
a
captain
climbed
up
the
barrier
officers
and
men
followed
him
they
stood
a
moment
on
the
crest
as
if
to
poise
themselves
and
then
leaped
down
among
the
french
where
they
were
killed
those
who
stood
on
the
other
side
were
swept
by
a
hurricane
of
fire
and
at
last
they
yielded
slowly
robert
saw
all
and
he
was
seized
with
a
great
horror
the
army
was
not
crashing
over
everything
those
who
entered
the
french
works
died
there
the
wooden
wall
held
nowhere
was
the
line
of
defense
broken
boats
loaded
with
troops
coming
down
the
outlet
of
lake
george
to
turn
the
french
left
were
repelled
by
the
muskets
of
the
canadian
volunteers
some
of
the
boats
were
sunk
and
the
soldiers
struggled
in
the
water
as
cannon
balls
and
bullets
beat
upon
them
his
view
of
the
field
was
blurred
for
a
while
by
the
smoke
from
so
much
firing
which
floated
in
thickening
clouds
over
all
the
open
spaces
and
the
edges
of
the
forest
it
produced
curious
optical
illusions
the
french
loomed
through
it
increased
fourfold
in
numbers
every
individual
man
magnified
in
size
he
saw
them
lurid
and
gigantic
pulling
the
triggers
of
their
rifles
or
muskets
or
working
the
batteries
the
cannon
also
grew
from
or
into
guns
three
or
four
times
as
large
and
many
stood
where
none
had
stood
before
the
smoke
continued
to
inflame
his
brain
also
and
it
made
him
pass
through
great
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
now
the
army
was
going
to
sweep
over
the
wooden
wall
in
spite
of
everything
with
sheer
weight
and
bravery
it
would
crush
the
french
and
take
ticonderoga
it
must
be
because
he
wanted
it
to
be
it
was
going
to
be
then
he
passed
to
the
other
extreme
when
one
of
the
charges
spent
itself
at
the
barrier
sending
perhaps
a
few
men
over
it
like
foam
from
a
wave
that
has
reached
its
crest
his
heart
sank
to
the
depths
and
he
was
sure
the
british
and
americans
could
not
come
again
mortal
men
would
not
offer
themselves
so
often
to
slaughter
if
the
firing
died
for
a
little
space
he
was
in
deep
despair
but
his
soul
leaped
up
again
as
the
charge
came
anew
it
was
certainly
victory
this
time
hope
could
not
be
crushed
in
him
his
vivid
fancy
made
him
hear
above
the
triumphant
shouts
of
the
french
the
deep
cheers
of
the
advancing
army
the
beating
of
drums
and
the
playing
of
invisible
bands
all
the
time
whether
in
attack
or
retreat
the
smoke
continued
to
increase
and
to
inflame
and
excite
it
was
like
a
gas
its
taste
was
acrid
and
bitter
as
death
robert
coughed
and
tried
to
blow
it
away
but
it
returned
in
waves
heavier
than
ever
and
then
he
ceased
to
fight
against
it
the
british
and
american
troops
came
again
and
again
to
the
attack
their
officers
leading
them
on
never
had
they
shown
greater
courage
or
more
willingness
to
die
when
the
first
lines
were
cut
down
at
the
barrier
others
took
their
places
they
charged
into
the
vast
mass
of
fallen
trees
and
against
the
spikes
blinded
by
the
smoke
of
so
much
firing
they
nevertheless
kept
their
faces
toward
the
enemy
and
sought
to
see
him
the
fierce
cheering
of
the
french
merely
encouraged
them
to
new
attempts
the
battle
went
on
for
hours
it
seemed
days
to
robert
mass
after
mass
of
british
and
colonials
continued
to
charge
upon
the
wooden
wall
always
to
be
broken
down
by
the
french
fire
leaving
heaps
of
their
dead
among
those
logs
and
boughs
and
on
that
bristling
array
of
spikes
at
last
they
advanced
no
more
twilight
came
over
the
field
the
terrible
fire
that
had
raged
since
noon
died
and
the
sun
set
upon
the
greatest
military
triumph
ever
won
by
france
in
the
new
world
twilight
gathered
over
the
most
sanguinary
field
america
had
yet
seen
in
the
east
the
dark
was
already
at
hand
but
in
the
west
the
light
from
the
sunken
sun
yet
lingered
casting
a
scarlet
glow
alike
over
the
fallen
and
the
triumphant
faces
of
the
victors
within
the
works
where
the
french
had
stood
fires
were
lighted
and
everything
there
was
brilliant
but
outside
where
so
much
valor
had
been
wasted
the
shadows
that
seemed
to
creep
out
of
the
illimitable
forest
grew
thicker
and
thicker
the
wind
moaned
incessantly
among
the
leaves
and
the
persistent
smoke
that
had
been
so
bitter
in
the
throat
and
nostrils
of
robert
still
hung
in
great
clouds
that
the
wind
moved
but
little
from
the
woods
came
long
fierce
howls
the
wolves
no
longer
frightened
by
the
crash
of
cannon
and
muskets
were
coming
and
under
cover
of
bushes
and
floating
smoke
they
crept
nearer
and
nearer
robert
sat
a
long
time
bewildered
stunned
the
incredible
had
happened
he
had
seen
it
with
his
own
eyes
and
yet
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
it
was
true
the
great
army
had
been
beaten
by
a
french
force
far
less
in
numbers
rather
it
had
beaten
itself
that
neglect
to
bring
up
the
cannon
had
proved
fatal
and
the
finest
force
yet
gathered
on
the
soil
of
north
america
had
been
cut
to
pieces
a
prodigious
opportunity
had
been
lost
by
a
commander
who
stayed
a
mile
and
a
half
in
the
rear
while
his
valiant
men
charged
to
certain
death
young
lennox
walked
stiffly
a
few
steps
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
in
the
dark
and
amid
the
joyous
excitement
of
the
defenders
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
frenchman
but
he
made
no
attempt
then
to
escape
no
such
thought
was
in
his
mind
for
the
moment
his
amazement
gave
way
to
horror
he
wanted
to
see
what
was
beyond
the
wooden
wall
where
he
knew
the
dead
and
wounded
lay
piled
deep
among
the
logs
and
sharpened
boughs
unbelievable
it
was
but
it
was
true
his
own
eyes
had
seen
and
his
own
ears
had
heard
he
listened
to
the
triumphant
shouts
of
the
french
and
his
soul
sank
within
him
a
few
shots
came
from
the
forest
now
and
then
but
the
great
army
had
vanished
save
for
its
fallen
montcalm
still
cautious
relaxing
no
vigilance
fearing
that
the
enemy
would
yet
come
back
with
his
cannon
walked
among
his
troops
and
gave
them
thanks
in
person
beer
and
wine
in
abundance
and
food
were
served
to
them
fires
were
lighted
and
the
field
that
they
had
defended
was
to
be
their
camp
many
scouts
were
sent
into
the
forest
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
opposing
army
most
of
the
soldiers
after
eating
and
drinking
threw
themselves
upon
the
ground
and
slept
but
it
was
long
before
the
leader
and
any
of
his
lieutenants
closed
their
eyes
although
he
felt
a
mighty
joy
over
his
great
victory
of
the
day
montcalm
was
still
a
prey
to
anxieties
his
own
force
triumphant
though
it
might
be
was
small
the
enemy
might
come
again
on
the
morrow
with
nearly
four
to
one
and
if
he
brought
his
cannon
with
him
he
could
take
ticonderoga
despite
the
great
losses
he
had
suffered
already
once
more
he
talked
with
luc
whom
he
trusted
implicitly
the
chevalier
did
not
believe
a
second
attack
would
be
made
and
his
belief
was
so
strong
it
amounted
to
a
conviction
the
same
mind
he
said
that
sent
their
army
against
us
without
artillery
will
now
go
to
the
other
extreme
having
deemed
us
negligible
it
will
think
us
invincible
luc
logic
was
correct
the
french
passed
the
night
in
peace
and
the
next
morning
when
de
levis
went
out
with
a
strong
party
to
look
for
the
enemy
he
found
that
he
was
gone
and
that
in
his
haste
he
had
left
behind
vast
quantities
of
food
and
other
supplies
which
the
french
eagerly
seized
montcalm
that
day
full
of
pride
caused
a
great
cross
to
be
erected
on
his
victorious
field
of
battle
and
upon
it
he
wrote
in
latin
quid
dux
quid
miles
quid
strata
ingentia
ligna
en
signum
en
victor
deus
hic
deus
ipse
triumphat
which
a
great
american
writer
has
translated
into
soldier
and
chief
and
ramparts
strength
are
nought
behold
the
conquering
cross
is
god
the
triumph
wrought
but
for
robert
the
night
that
closed
down
was
the
blackest
he
had
ever
known
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
abercrombie
army
could
be
defeated
confident
in
its
overwhelming
numbers
he
had
believed
that
it
would
easily
sweep
away
the
french
and
take
ticonderoga
the
skill
and
valor
of
montcalm
luc
de
levis
and
the
others
no
matter
how
skillful
and
valiant
they
might
be
could
avail
nothing
and
after
ticonderoga
it
would
be
a
mere
question
of
time
until
crown
point
fell
too
and
after
that
would
come
quebec
and
the
conquest
of
canada
now
when
his
spirits
had
soared
so
high
the
fall
was
correspondingly
low
his
sensitive
mind
upon
which
events
always
painted
themselves
with
such
vividness
reflected
only
the
darkest
pictures
he
saw
the
triumphant
advance
of
the
french
the
indians
laying
waste
the
whole
of
new
york
province
and
the
enemy
at
the
gates
of
new
york
itself
the
night
itself
was
a
perfect
reproduction
of
his
own
mind
he
saw
through
his
spirits
as
through
a
glass
the
dusk
was
thick
heavy
it
was
noisome
it
had
a
quality
that
was
almost
ponderable
it
was
unpleasant
to
eye
and
nostril
he
tasted
and
breathed
the
smoke
that
was
shot
through
it
and
he
felt
a
sickening
of
the
soul
he
heard
a
wind
moaning
through
the
forest
and
it
was
to
him
a
dirge
the
lament
of
those
who
had
fallen
he
knew
there
had
been
no
lack
of
bravery
on
the
part
of
his
own
after
a
while
he
took
some
consolation
in
that
fact
british
and
americans
had
come
to
the
attack
long
after
hope
of
success
was
gone
they
had
not
known
how
to
win
but
never
had
men
known
better
how
to
die
such
valor
would
march
to
triumph
in
the
end
he
lay
awake
almost
the
whole
night
and
he
did
not
expect
abercrombie
to
advance
again
somehow
he
had
the
feeling
that
the
play
so
far
as
this
particular
drama
was
concerned
was
played
out
the
blow
was
so
heavy
that
he
was
in
a
dull
and
apathetic
state
from
which
he
was
stirred
only
once
in
the
evening
and
that
was
when
two
frenchmen
passed
near
him
escorting
a
prisoner
of
whose
face
he
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
firelight
he
started
forward
exclaiming
charteris
the
young
man
tall
handsome
and
firm
of
feature
although
a
captive
turned
who
called
me
he
asked
it
is
i
robert
lennox
said
robert
i
knew
you
in
new
york
aye
lennox
i
recognize
you
now
we
meet
again
after
so
long
a
time
i
could
have
preferred
the
meeting
to
be
elsewhere
and
under
other
circumstances
but
it
is
something
to
know
that
you
are
alive
they
shook
hands
with
great
friendliness
and
the
frenchmen
who
were
guarding
charteris
waited
patiently
may
our
next
meeting
be
under
brighter
omens
said
robert
i
think
it
will
be
said
charteris
confidently
then
he
went
on
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
were
to
see
each
other
again
and
the
drama
that
was
to
bring
them
face
to
face
once
more
was
destined
to
be
as
thrilling
as
that
at
ticonderoga
the
next
night
came
heavy
and
dark
and
robert
who
continued
to
be
treated
with
singular
forbearance
wandered
toward
lake
champlain
which
lay
pale
and
shadowy
under
the
thick
dusk
no
one
stopped
him
the
sentinels
seemed
to
have
business
elsewhere
and
suddenly
he
remembered
his
old
threat
to
escape
hope
returned
to
a
mind
that
had
been
stunned
for
a
time
and
it
came
back
vivid
and
strong
then
hope
sank
down
again
when
a
figure
issued
from
the
dusk
and
stood
before
him
it
was
luc
lennox
said
the
chevalier
what
are
you
doing
here
merely
wandering
about
replied
robert
i
a
prisoner
as
you
know
but
no
one
is
bothering
about
me
which
i
take
to
be
natural
when
the
echoes
of
so
great
a
battle
have
scarcely
yet
died
luc
looked
at
him
keenly
and
robert
met
his
gaze
he
could
not
read
the
eye
of
the
chevalier
you
have
been
a
prisoner
of
ours
once
before
but
you
escaped
said
the
chevalier
it
seems
that
you
are
a
hard
lad
to
hold
but
then
i
had
the
help
of
the
greatest
trailer
and
forest
runner
in
the
world
my
staunch
friend
tayoga
the
onondaga
if
he
rescued
you
once
he
will
probably
try
to
do
it
again
and
the
great
hunter
willet
is
likely
to
be
with
him
i
suppose
you
were
planning
a
few
moments
ago
to
escape
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
i
might
have
been
but
i
see
now
that
it
is
too
late
too
late
is
a
phrase
that
should
be
seldom
used
by
youth
robert
tried
once
again
to
read
the
chevalier
eye
but
look
contained
the
old
enigma
i
admit
said
young
lennox
that
i
thought
i
might
find
an
open
place
in
your
line
it
was
only
a
possible
chance
luc
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
the
darkness
that
lay
before
them
like
a
great
black
blanket
there
is
much
yet
to
be
done
by
us
at
ticonderoga
he
said
perhaps
it
is
true
that
a
possible
chance
for
you
to
escape
does
exist
but
my
duties
are
too
important
for
me
to
concern
myself
about
guarding
a
single
prisoner
his
figure
vanished
he
was
gone
without
noise
and
robert
stared
at
the
place
where
he
had
been
then
the
hope
of
escape
came
back
more
vivid
and
more
powerful
than
ever
too
late
was
a
phrase
that
should
not
be
known
to
youth
luc
was
right
he
walked
straight
ahead
no
sentinel
barred
the
way
presently
the
lake
still
and
luminous
stretched
across
his
path
and
darting
into
the
bushes
along
its
edge
he
ran
for
a
long
time
then
he
sank
down
and
looked
back
he
saw
dimly
the
lights
of
the
camp
but
he
heard
no
sound
of
pursuit
rising
he
began
a
great
curve
about
ticonderoga
intending
to
seek
his
own
army
which
he
knew
could
not
yet
be
far
away
once
he
heard
light
footsteps
and
hid
deep
in
the
bush
from
his
covert
he
saw
a
band
of
warriors
at
least
twenty
in
number
go
by
their
lean
sinewy
figures
showing
faintly
in
the
dusk
their
faces
were
turned
toward
the
south
and
he
shuddered
already
they
were
beginning
to
raid
the
border
he
knew
that
they
had
taken
little
or
no
part
in
the
battle
at
ticonderoga
but
now
the
great
success
of
the
french
would
bring
them
flocking
back
to
montcalm
banner
and
they
would
rush
like
wolves
upon
those
whom
they
thought
defenseless
hoping
for
more
slaughters
like
that
of
william
henry
tandakora
would
not
neglect
such
a
glowing
opportunity
for
scalps
his
savage
spirit
would
incite
the
warriors
to
attempts
yet
greater
and
robert
looked
closely
at
the
dusky
line
thinking
for
a
moment
that
he
might
be
there
but
he
did
not
see
his
gigantic
figure
and
the
warriors
flitted
on
gone
like
shadows
in
the
darkness
then
the
fugitive
youth
resumed
his
own
flight
far
in
the
night
robert
sank
down
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
it
was
a
physical
and
mental
collapse
coming
with
great
suddenness
but
he
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
the
natural
consequence
flowing
from
a
period
of
such
excessive
strain
his
emotions
throughout
the
great
battle
had
been
tense
and
violent
and
they
had
been
hardly
less
so
in
the
time
that
followed
and
in
the
course
of
the
events
that
led
to
his
escape
and
knowing
he
forced
himself
to
do
what
was
necessary
he
lay
down
in
the
shelter
of
dense
bushes
and
kept
himself
perfectly
quiet
for
a
long
time
he
would
not
allow
hand
or
foot
to
move
his
weary
heart
at
last
began
to
beat
with
regularity
the
blood
ceased
to
pound
in
his
temples
and
his
nerves
grew
steadier
he
dozed
a
little
or
at
least
passed
into
a
state
that
was
midway
between
wakefulness
and
oblivion
then
the
terrible
battle
was
fought
once
more
before
him
again
he
heard
the
crash
and
roar
of
the
french
fire
again
he
saw
british
and
americans
coming
forward
in
indomitable
masses
offering
themselves
to
death
once
again
he
saw
them
tangled
among
the
logs
and
sharpened
boughs
and
then
mowed
down
at
the
wooden
wall
he
roused
himself
and
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
to
shut
away
that
vision
of
the
stricken
field
and
the
vivid
reminder
of
his
terrible
disappointment
the
picture
was
still
as
fresh
as
the
reality
and
it
sent
shudders
through
him
every
time
he
saw
it
he
would
keep
it
from
his
sight
whenever
he
could
lest
he
grow
too
morbid
he
rose
and
started
once
more
toward
the
south
but
the
forest
became
more
dense
and
tangled
and
the
country
rougher
in
his
weakened
state
he
was
not
able
to
think
with
his
usual
clearness
and
precision
and
he
lost
the
sense
of
direction
he
began
to
wander
about
aimlessly
and
at
last
he
stopped
almost
in
despair
he
was
in
a
desperate
plight
he
was
unarmed
and
a
man
alone
and
without
weapons
in
the
wilderness
was
usually
as
good
as
lost
he
looked
around
trying
to
study
the
points
of
the
compass
the
night
was
not
dark
trees
and
bushes
stood
up
distinctly
and
on
a
bough
not
far
away
his
eyes
suddenly
caught
a
flash
of
blue
the
flash
was
made
by
a
small
glossy
bird
that
wavered
on
a
bough
and
he
was
about
to
turn
away
taking
no
further
notice
of
it
when
the
bird
flew
slowly
before
him
and
in
a
direction
which
he
now
knew
led
straight
toward
the
south
he
remembered
back
to
his
mind
rushed
an
earlier
escape
and
how
he
had
followed
the
flight
of
a
bird
to
safety
had
tayoga
manitou
intervened
again
in
his
favor
was
it
chance
or
did
he
in
a
dazed
state
imagine
that
he
saw
what
he
did
not
see
the
bird
an
azure
flash
flew
on
before
him
and
hope
flowing
in
an
invincible
tide
in
his
veins
he
followed
he
was
in
continual
fear
lest
the
blue
flame
fade
away
but
on
he
went
over
hills
and
across
valleys
and
brooks
and
it
was
always
just
before
him
he
had
been
worn
and
weary
before
but
now
he
felt
strong
and
active
courage
rose
steadily
in
his
veins
and
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
reach
friends
near
dawn
the
bird
suddenly
disappeared
among
the
leaves
robert
stopped
and
heard
a
light
in
the
bushes
being
apprehensive
lest
he
be
he
shrank
away
and
then
stopped
he
listened
a
while
and
the
sound
not
being
repeated
he
hoped
that
he
had
been
mistaken
but
a
voice
called
suddenly
from
a
bush
not
ten
feet
away
come
dagaeoga
the
great
bear
and
i
await
you
tododaho
watching
on
his
star
has
sent
us
into
your
path
robert
uttering
a
joyful
cry
sprang
forward
and
the
onondaga
and
willet
rising
from
the
thicket
greeted
him
with
the
utmost
warmth
i
knew
we
find
you
again
said
willet
how
did
you
manage
to
escape
a
way
seemed
to
open
for
me
replied
robert
the
last
man
i
saw
in
the
french
camp
was
luc
after
that
i
met
no
sentinel
although
i
passed
where
a
sentinel
would
stand
ah
said
willet
they
gave
him
food
and
after
sunrise
they
started
toward
the
south
robert
told
how
he
had
seen
the
great
battle
and
the
french
victory
tayoga
black
rifle
grosvenor
and
i
were
in
the
attack
said
willet
but
we
went
through
it
without
a
scratch
no
troops
ever
fought
more
bravely
than
ours
the
defeat
was
the
fault
of
the
commander
not
theirs
but
we
put
behind
us
the
battle
lost
and
think
of
the
battle
yet
to
be
won
so
we
will
said
robert
as
he
looked
around
at
the
great
curving
forest
its
deep
green
tinted
with
the
light
brown
of
summer
it
was
a
friendly
forest
now
it
no
longer
had
the
aspect
of
the
night
before
when
the
wolves
their
jaws
slavering
in
anticipation
howled
in
its
thickets
rabbits
sprang
up
as
they
passed
but
the
little
creatures
of
the
wild
did
not
seem
to
be
afraid
they
did
not
run
away
instead
they
crouched
under
the
bushes
and
gazed
with
mild
eyes
at
the
human
beings
who
made
no
threats
a
deer
drinking
at
the
edge
of
a
brook
raised
its
head
a
little
and
then
continued
to
drink
birds
sang
in
the
dewy
dawn
with
uncommon
freshness
and
sweetness
the
whole
world
was
renewed
creature
as
he
was
of
his
moods
robert
spirits
soared
again
at
his
meeting
with
tayoga
and
willet
those
staunch
friends
of
his
bound
to
him
by
such
strong
ties
and
so
many
dangers
shared
the
past
was
the
past
ticonderoga
was
a
defeat
a
great
defeat
when
a
victory
had
been
expected
but
it
was
not
irreparable
hope
sang
in
his
heart
and
his
face
flushed
in
the
dawn
the
onondaga
looking
at
him
smiled
dagaeoga
already
looks
to
the
future
he
said
so
i
do
replied
robert
with
enthusiasm
why
should
i
the
night
just
passed
has
favored
me
i
escaped
i
met
you
and
dave
and
it
a
glorious
morning
the
sun
was
rising
in
a
splendid
sea
of
color
tinting
the
woods
with
red
and
gold
never
had
the
wilderness
looked
more
beautiful
to
him
he
turned
his
face
in
the
direction
of
ticonderoga
we
come
back
he
said
his
heart
full
of
courage
and
we
yet
win
the
victory
even
to
the
taking
of
quebec
so
we
will
said
the
hunter
aye
stadacona
itself
will
fall
said
tayoga
refreshed
and
strong
they
plunged
anew
into
the
forest
traveling
swiftly
toward
the
south
