victor
marie
hugo
their
second
son
was
born
on
the
of
february
at
besançon
france
though
a
weakling
he
was
carried
with
his
in
the
train
of
their
father
through
the
south
of
france
in
pursuit
of
fra
diavolo
the
italian
brigand
and
finally
into
spain
colonel
hugo
had
become
general
and
there
besides
being
governor
over
three
provinces
was
lord
high
steward
at
king
joseph
court
where
his
eldest
son
abel
was
installed
as
page
the
other
two
were
educated
for
similar
posts
among
hostile
young
spaniards
under
stern
priestly
tutors
in
the
nobles
college
at
madrid
a
palace
become
a
monastery
upon
the
english
advance
to
free
spain
of
the
invaders
the
general
and
abel
remained
at
bay
whilst
the
mother
and
children
hastened
to
paris
again
in
a
house
once
a
convent
victor
and
his
brother
eugène
were
taught
by
priests
until
by
the
accident
of
their
roof
sheltering
a
comrade
of
their
father
a
change
of
tutor
was
afforded
them
this
was
general
lahorie
a
man
of
superior
education
main
supporter
of
malet
in
his
daring
plot
to
take
the
government
into
the
republicans
hands
during
the
absence
of
napoleon
in
russia
lahorie
read
old
french
and

with
victor
till
the
police
scented
him
out
and
led
him
to
execution
october
school
claimed
the
young
hugos
after
this
tragical
episode
where
they
were
oddities
among
the
humdrum
tradesmen
sons
victor
thoughtful
and
taciturn
rhymed
profusely
in
tragedies
printing
in
his
books
châteaubriand
or
nothing
and
engaging
his
more
animated
brother
to
flourish
the
cid
sword
and
roar
the
tyrant
speeches
in
both
suffered
a
sympathetic
anxiety
as
their
father
held
out
at
thionville
against
the
allies
finally
repulsing
them
by
a
sortie
this
was
pure
loyalty
to
the
fallen
bonaparte
for
hugo
had
lost
his
all
in
spain
his
very
savings
having
been
sunk
in
real
estate
through
king
insistence
on
his
adherents
investing
to
prove
they
had
come
to
stay
the
bourbons
enthroned
anew
general
hugo
received
less
for
his
neutrality
than
thanks
to
his
wife
piety
and
loyalty
confirmation
of
his
title
and
rank
and
moreover
a
fieldmarshalship
abel
was
accepted
as
a
page
too
but
there
was
no
money
awarded
the
money
being
what
the
eaglet
at
reichstadt
most
required
for
an
attempt
at
his
throne
and
the
poor
officer
was
left
in
seclusion
to
write
consolingly
about
his
campaigns
and
defences
of
fortified
towns
decidedly
the
pen
had
superseded
the
sword
for
victor
and
eugène
were
scribbling
away
in
ephemeral
political
sheets
as
apprenticeship
to
founding
a
periodical
of
their
own
victor
poetry
became
remarkable
in
muse
and
conservateur
the
odes
being
permeated
with
legitimist
and
sentiments
delightful
to
the
taste
of
madam
hugo
member
as
she
was
of
the
courtly
order
of
the
royal
lily
in
the
french
academy
honorably
mentioned
victor
odes
on
the
advantages
of
study
with
a
misgiving
that
some
elder
hand
was
masked
under
the
line
ascribing
scant
fifteen
years
to
the
author
at
the
toulouse
floral
games
he
won
prizes
two
years
successively
his
critical
judgment
was
sound
as
well
for
he
had
divined
the
powers
of
lamartine
his
odes
collected
in
a
volume
gave
his
mother
her
opportunity
at
court
louis
xviii
granted
the
a
pension
of
francs
it
was
the
windfall
for
which
the
youth
had
been
waiting
to
enable
him
to
gratify
his
first
love
in
his
childhood
his
father
and
one
foucher
head
of
a
war
office
department
had
jokingly
betrothed
a
son
of
the
one
to
a
daughter
of
the
other
abel
had
loftier
views
than
alliance
with
a
civil
servant
child
eugène
was
in
love
elsewhere
but
victor
had
fallen
enamored
with
adèle
foucher
it
is
true
when
poverty
beclouded
the
hugos
the
fouchers
had
shrunk
into
their
mantle
of
dignity
and
the
girl
had
been
strictly
forbidden
to
correspond
with
her
he
finding
letters
barred
out
wrote
a
love
story
hans
of
iceland
in
two
weeks
where
were
recited
his
hopes
fears
and
constancy
and
this
book
she
could
read
it
pleased
the
public
no
less
and
its
sale
together
with
that
of
the
odes
and
a
west
indian
romance
buck
jargal
together
with
a
royal
pension
emboldened
the
poet
to
renew
his
to
refuse
the
recipient
of
court
funds
was
not
possible
to
a
public
functionary
foucher
consented
to
the
betrothal
in
the
summer
of
so
encloistered
had
mdlle
adèle
been
her
reading
hans
the
exceptional
intrusion
that
she
only
learnt
on
meeting
her
affianced
that
he
was
mourning
his
mother
in
october
they
were
wed
the
bride
nineteen
the
bridegroom
but
one
year
the
elder
the
dinner
was
marred
by
the
sinister
disaster
of
eugène
hugo
going
mad
he
died
in
an
asylum
five
years
later
the
author
terminated
his
wedding
year
with
the
ode
to
louis
read
to
a
society
after
the
president
of
the
academy
had
introduced
him
as
the
most
promising
of
our
young
lyrists
in
spite
of
new
poems
revealing
a
napoleonic
bias
victor
was
invited
to
see
charles
consecrated
at
rheims
of
may
and
was
entered
on
the
roll
of
the
legion
of
honor
repaying
the
favors
with
the
verses
expected
but
though
a
son
was
born
to
him
he
was
not
restored
to
conservatism
with
his
mother
death
all
that
had
vanished
his
tragedy
of
cromwell
broke
lances
upon
royalists
and
upholders
of
the
still
reigning
style
of
tragedy
the
second
collection
of
odes
preluding
it
showed
the
spirit
of
the
son
of
napoleon
general
rather
than
of
the
bourbonist
on
the
occasion
too
of
the
duke
of
tarento
being
announced
at
the
austrian
ambassador
ball
february
as
plain
marshal
macdonald
victor
became
the
mouthpiece
of
indignant
bonapartists
in
his
ode
to
the
napoleon
column
in
the
place
vendôme
his
orientales
though
written
in
a
parisian
suburb
by
one
who
had
not
travelled
appealed
for
grecian
liberty
and
depicted
sultans
and
pashas
as
tyrants
many
a
line
being
deemed
applicable
to
personages
nearer
the
seine
than
stamboul
cromwell
was
not
actable
and
amy
robsart
in
collaboration
with
his
foucher
miserably
failed
notwithstanding
a
finale
superior
to
scott
in
one
twelvemonth
there
was
this
failure
to
record
the
death
of
his
father
from
apoplexy
at
his
eldest
son
marriage
and
the
birth
of
a
second
son
to
victor
towards
the
close
still
imprudent
the
young
father
again
irritated
the
court
with
satire
in
marion
delorme
and
hernani
two
plays
immediately
suppressed
by
the
censure
all
the
more
active
as
the
revolution
of
july
was
surely
seething
up
to
the
edge
of
the
crater
at
this
juncture
the
poet
châteaubriand
fading
star
to
our
rising
sun
yielded
up
to
him
formally
his
place
at
the
poets
table
in
the
summer
of
a
civil
ceremony
was
performed
over
the
insurgents
killed
in
the
previous
year
and
hugo
was
constituted
of
the
revolution
by
having
his
hymn
sung
in
the
pantheon
over
the
biers
under
louis
philippe
marion
delorme
could
be
played
but
livelier
attention
was
turned
to
nôtre
dame
de
paris
the
historical
romance
in
which
hugo
vied
with
sir
walter
it
was
to
have
been
followed
by
others
but
the
publisher
unfortunately
secured
a
contract
to
monopolize
all
the
new
novelist
prose
fictions
for
a
term
of
years
and
the
author
revenged
himself
by
publishing
poems
and
plays
alone
hence
nôtre
dame
long
stood
unique
it
was
translated
in
all
languages
and
plays
and
operas
were
founded
on
it
heine
professed
to
see
in
the
prominence
of
the
hunchback
a
personal
appeal
of
the
author
who
was
slightly
deformed
by
one
shoulder
being
a
trifle
higher
than
the
other
this
malicious
suggestion
reposed
also
on
the
fact
that
the
of
le
roi
a
tragedy
suppressed
after
one
representation
for
its
reflections
on
royalty
was
also
a
contorted
piece
of
humanity
this
play
was
followed
by
lucrezia
borgia
marie
tudor
and
angelo
written
in
a
singular
poetic
prose
spite
of
bald
translations
their
action
was
sufficiently
dramatic
to
make
them
successes
and
even
still
enduring
on
our
stage
they
have
all
been
arranged
as
operas
whilst
hugo
himself
to
oblige
the
father
of
louise
bertin
a
magazine
publisher
of
note
wrote
esmeralda
for
her
music
in
thus
at
when
he
was
promoted
to
an
officership
in
the
legion
of
honor
it
was
acknowledged
his
due
as
a
laborious
worker
in
all
fields
of
literature
however
contestable
the
merits
and
tendencies
of
his
essays
in
the
academy
having
rejected
him
several
times
elected
him
among
the
forty
immortals
in
the
previous
year
had
been
successfully
acted
ruy
blas
for
which
play
he
had
gone
to
spanish
sources
with
and
after
the
then
imperative
rhine
tour
came
an
unendurable
trilogy
the
burgraves
played
one
long
long
night
in
a
real
tragedy
was
to
mark
that
year
his
daughter
léopoldine
being
drowned
in
the
seine
with
her
husband
who
would
not
save
himself
when
he
found
that
her
on
the
sinking
boat
was
not
to
be
loosed
for
distraction
hugo
plunged
into
politics
a
peer
in
he
sat
between
marshal
soult
and
pontécoulant
the
of
louis
xvi
his
maiden
speech
bore
upon
artistic
copyright
but
he
rapidly
became
a
power
in
much
graver
matters
as
fate
would
have
it
his
speech
on
the
bonapartes
induced
king
louis
philippe
to
allow
prince
louis
napoleon
bonaparte
to
return
and
there
being
no
gratitude
in
politics
the
emancipated
outlaw
rose
as
a
rival
candidate
for
the
presidency
for
which
hugo
had
nominated
himself
in
his
newspaper
the
the
story
of
the
is
well
known
for
the
republican
side
read
hugo
own
history
of
a
crime
hugo
proscribed
betook
himself
to
brussels
london
and
the
channel
islands
waiting
to
return
with
right
when
the
usurper
should
be
expelled
meanwhile
he
satirized
the
third
napoleon
and
his
congeners
with
ceaseless
shafts
the
principal
being
the
famous
napoleon
the
little
based
on
the
analogical
reasoning
that
as
the
earth
has
moons
the
lion
the
jackal
man
himself
his
simian
double
a
minor
napoleon
was
inevitable
as
a
standard
of
estimation
the
grain
by
which
a
pyramid
is
measured
these
flings
were
collected
in
les
châtiments
a
volume
preceded
by
les
contemplations
mostly
written
in
the
and
followed
by
les
chansons
des
rues
et
des
bois
the
baffled
publisher
having
expired
or
at
least
his
heirs
being
satisfied
three
novels
appeared
long
heralded
in
les
misérables
ye
wretched
wherein
the
author
figures
as
marius
and
his
father
as
the
bonapartist
officer
in

sweetly
lies
an

looks
as

pillowed
on

he
sleeps
oh
see
his

swims
on

there
at

led

down
beneath

the

appears
to
rock
the

upon

he
wakes
ah

of

haste
oh
haste
he
cries
alas
what
mother
could
confide
her
offspring
to
the
wild
and
watery
waste
he
stretches
out
his
arms
the
rippling
tide
murmurs
around
him
where
all
rudely
placed
he
rests
but
with
a
few
frail

beneath

such
helpless
innocence
and
death
oh

he
is

the

is

she
holds
the

captured

by

blew
them
back
into

put
out
their

more
than

perished
harmless

the

their

crept
the
shades
of
night
whilst
scarce
distinguished
in
the
black
profound

aqueducts
great
pillars
gleamed
around

then
was
seen
a

of

a

arise
monsters
around
the

my

kindled

beneath

seemed
oft
unto

watched

along

had
rained
its
stars
in

my

so
fearless
in

my
dauntless
khans
my
spahis
brave
swift
thunderbolts
of

my
sunburnt
bedouins
trooping
from

afar
who
laughed
to
see
the
laboring
hind
stand
terrified
at
gaze
and
urged
their
desert
horses
on
amid
the
ripening
maize
these
horses
with
their
fiery
eyes
their
slight
untiring
feet
that
flew
along
the
fields
of
corn
like
grasshoppers
so
fleet
what
to
behold
again
no
more
loud
charging
the
plain
their
squadrons
in
the
hostile
shot
diminished
all
in
vain
burst
grandly
on
the
heavy
squares
like
clouds
that
bear
the
storms
enveloping
in
lightning
fires
the
dark
resisting
swarms
oh
they
are
dead
their
housings
bright
are
trailed
amid
their
gore
dark
blood
is
on
their
manes
and
sides
all
deeply
clotted
all
vainly
now
the
spur
would
strike
these
cold
and
rounded
flanks
to
wake
them
to
their
wonted
speed
amid
the
rapid
ranks
here
the
bold
riders
red
and
stark
upon
the
sands
lie
down
who
in
their
friendly
shadows
slept
throughout
the
halt
at

oh
allah
who
will
give
me
back
my
terrible
array
see
where
it
straggles
the

for

on

flung
prodigal

tartar
chiefs
or
of
arabian
birth
their

their

their

seem
now
as
if
a
troubled
dream
had
passed
before
mine
eyes
my
valiant
warriors
and
their
steeds
thus
doomed
to
fall
and
bleed
their
voices
rouse
no
echo
now
their
footsteps
have
no
speed
they
sleep
and
have
forgot
at
last
the
sabre
and
the
bit
yon
vale
with
all
the
corpses
heaped
seems
one
wide
long
shall
the

rest
upon

the

unspent
amid

fatal
fiery
ring
enamoured
of
the
fight
now
the
dim
horizon
sinks
the
peaceful
pall
of
night
the
brave
have
nobly
done
their
work
and
calmly
sleep
at
last
the
crows
begin
and
the
dead
are
gathering
dark
and
fast
already
through
their
feathers
black
they
pass
their
eager
beaks
forth
from
the
forest
distant
depth
from
bald
and
barren
peaks
they
congregate
in
hungry
flocks
and
rend
their
gory
prey
woe
to
that
flaunting
army
pride
so
vaunting
yesterday
that
formidable
host
alas
is
coldly
nerveless
now
to
drive
the
vulture
from
his
gorge
or
scare
the
carrion
crow
were
now
that
host
again
mine
own

with

oh
what

unrestoring
death
that
jealous
tyrant

do
with
the
brave
departed
souls
that
can
not
swing
a

why
turned
the

aside
from

why
struck
no

hand
my

within
its

yesterday
a

drums
were
heard
when
i
went
by

forty
agas
turned
their
looks
respectful
on
mine
eye
and
trembled
with
contracted
brows
within
their
hall

instead
of
heavy
catapults
of
slow
unwieldy
weight
i
had
bright
cannons
rolling
on

wheels
in
threatening
tiers
and
calm
and
steady
by
their
sides
marched
english
cannoniers
but
yesterday
and
i
had
towns
and
castles
strong
and
high
and
greeks
in
thousands
for
the
base
and
merciless
to
buy
but
yesterday
and
arsenals
and
harems
were
my
own
while
now
defeated
and
proscribed
deserted
and
alone
i
flee
away
a
fugitive

of
my
former

not
now
at

one

must

the

bounding

where
distant
vision
fails
all
stealthily
with
eyes
on

and
shrinking
from
the
sight
as
a
nocturnal
robber
holds
his
dark
and
breathless
flight
and

he
sees
the
gibbet
spread
its

the

it
regards
from

the

panted
moving

who
never

my
chair

sent

then
let
fly
a
shower
of
words
the
envious
use
get
out

said
with

me
alone
alone
i

poor
man
alone
ah
what
fine
result
what
triumph
rare
as
one
turns
from
the
coffin
dead
so
left
you
me
i
could
but
stare
upon
the
door
through
which
you
fled
i
proud
and
grave
but
punished
quite
and
what
care
you
for
this
my
plight
you
have
recovered
liberty
fresh
air
and
lovely
scenery
the
spacious
park
and
grass
the
running
stream
where
you
can
throw
a
blade
to
watch
what
comes
to
pass
blue
sky
and
all
the
spring
can
show
nature
serenely
fair
to
see
the
book
of
birds

free
god
poem
worth
much
more
than
mine
where
flowers
for
perfect
stanzas
shine
flowers
that
a
child
may
pluck
in
play
no
harsh
voice
frightening
it
away
and
i
alone
all
pleasure
alone
with
pedant
called
ennui
for
since
the
morning
at
my
door
ennui
has
waited
patiently
that
born
you
mark
one
sunday
in
december
dark
poor
little
ones
he
loved
you
not
and
waited
till
the
chance
he
got
to
enter
as
you
passed
away
and
in
the
very
corner
where
you
played
with
frolic
laughter
gay
he
sighs
and
yawns
with
weary
air
what
can
i
do
shall
i
read
books
or
write
more
verse
or
turn
fond
looks
upon
enamels
blue
and
white
on
insects
rare
as
seen
upon
my
dresden
china
ware
or
shall
i
touch
the
globe
and
care
to
make
the
heavens
turn
upon
its
axis
no
not
one
not
one
of
all
these
things
care
i
to
do
all
wearies
me
i
think
of
you
in
truth
with
you
my
sunshine
fled
and
gayety
with
your
light
tread
glad
noise
that
set
me
dreaming
still
was
my
delight
to
watch
your
will
and
mark
you
point
with
to
help
your
spelling
out
a
word
to
see
the
pearls
between
your
lips
when
i
your
joyous
laughter
heard
your
honest
brows
that
looked
so
true
and
said
oh
yes
to
each
intent
your
great
bright
eyes
that
loved
to
view
with
admiration
innocent
my
fine
old
sèvres
the
eager
thought
that
every
kind
of
knowledge
sought
the
elbow
push
with
come
and
see
oh
certes
spirits
sylphs
there
be
and
fays
the
wind
blows
often
here
the
gnomes
that
squat
the
ceiling
near
in
corners
made
by
old
books
dim
the
dwarfs
those
goblins
grim
that
seem
at
home
vases
rare
and
chat
to
them
with
friendly
air
oh
how
the
joyous
demon
throng
must
all
have
laughed
with
laughter
long
to
see
you
on
my
rough
drafts
fall
my
bald
hexameters
and
all
the
mournful
miserable
band
and
drag
them
with
relentless
hand
from
out
their
box
with
true
delight
to
set
them
each
and
all
and
then
with
clapping
hands
to
lean
above
the
stove
and
watch
the
scene
how
to
the
mass
deformed
there
came
a
soul
that
showed
itself
in
flame
bright
tricksy
children
oh
i
pray
come
back
and
sing
and
dance
away
and
chatter
too
sometimes
you
may
a
giddy
group
a
big
book
seize
or
sometimes
if
it
so
you
please
with
nimble
step
you
run
to
me
and
push
the
arm
that
holds
the
pen
till
on
my
finished
verse
will
be
a
stroke
that
like
a
steeple
when
seen
suddenly
upon
a
plain
my
soul
longs
for
your
breath
again
to
warm
it
oh
return
come
here
with
laugh
and
babble
and
no
fear
when
with
your
shadow
you
obscure
the
book
i
read
for
i
am
sure
oh
madcaps
terrible
and
dear
that
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
but
who
has
with
scolding
tongue
blamed
out
of
season
pardon
me
you
must
forgive
for
sad
are
we
the
young
should
not
be
hard
and
cold
and
unforgiving
to
the
old
children
each
morn
your
souls
ope
out
like
windows
to
the
shining
day
oh
miracle
that
comes
about
the
miracle
that
children
gay
have
happiness
and
goodness
too
caressed
by
destiny
are
you
charming
you
are
if
you
but
play
but
we
with
living
overwrought
and
full
of
grave
and
sombre
thought
are
snappish
oft
dear
little
men
we
have
days
and
then
are
quite
unjust
and
full
of
care
it
rained
this
morning
and
the
air
was
chill
but
clouds
that
dimm
the
sky
have
passed
things
spited
me
and
why
but
now
my
heart
repents
behold
what
was
that
made
me
cross
and
scold
all
you
understand
when
brows
are
mark
by
time
stern
hand
then
you
will
comprehend
be
sure
when
older
that
to
say
less
pure
the
fault
i
freely
own
was
mine
but
oh
for
pardon
now
i
pine
enough
my
punishment
to
meet
you
must
forgive
i
do
entreat
with
clasped
hands
praying
oh
come
back
make
peace
and
you
shall
nothing
lack
see
now

pencils
paper
here
and

so
coveted
by

my
great
and
tapestried

chair

will
from
you
no
longer
keep
you
shall
about
my
table
climb
and
dance
or
drag
without
a
cry
from
me
as
if
it
were
a
crime
even
i
look
on
patiently
if
you
your
jagged
toys
all
throw
upon
my
carved
bench
till
it
show
the

torn

freely
too

leave
in
your
own

desired

touch

inspired
with

attired

if

verses
burn
should
seem
to
you
a

children

suffered
and
you
still
know
not
what
gloomy
thoughts
weigh
down
the
weary
grown
what
warmth
is
shed
by
your
sweet
smile
how
much
he
needs
to
gaze
awhile
upon
your

his

from

to
see
what

show
of

that

to
my

most
dear
in
how
short
a
span
doth
all
nature
change
how
quickly
she
smoothes
with
her
hand
serene
and
how
rarely
she
snaps
in
her
ceaseless
range
the
links
that
bound
our
hearts
to
the
scene
our
beautiful

are
all
laid
waste
the

felled
that
our

once
bore
our
rows
of
roses
by

are
destroyed
where
they
leap
the
barrier
the
fount
is
walled
in
where
at
noonday
pride
she
so
gayly
drank
from
the
wood
descending
in
her
fairy
hand
was
transformed
the
tide
and
it
turned
to
pearls
through
her
fingers
wending
the
wild
rugged
path

paved
with
spars
where
erst
in
the
sand
her
footsteps
were
traced
when
so
small
were
the

that
the

that
they
seemed

effaced

on

of

my

is

avoid
the

the
thundering

here
the

there
the

there
is

left

bereft

we

he
seemed
to
shiver
for
the

was
keen
was
a
poor
statue
underneath
a
mass
of
leafless
branches
with
a
blackened
back
and
a
green
foot
an
isolated
faun
in
old
deserted
park
who
bending
forward
himself
in
the
entangled
boughs
half
in
his
marble
settings
he
was
there
pensive
and
bound
to
earth
and
as
all
things
devoid
of
movement
he
was
there
forgotten
trees
were
around
him
whipped
by
icy
blasts
gigantic
chestnuts
without
leaf
or
bird
and
like
himself
grown
old
in
that
same
place
through
the
dark
network
of
their
undergrowth
pallid
his
aspect
and
the
earth
was
brown
starless
and
moonless

might

were
you

you

of

have
you
not
sometimes
with
that
oblique
eye
winked
at
the
farnese

alone
have
you
o

considerately
turned
from
side
to
side
when
came
and
now
advised
as
shepherd
now
as
satyr
have
you
sometimes
upon
this
very
bench
seen
at
vincent

instilling
grace
into

have
you
ever
thrown
that
searching
glance
on
louis
with

on
anne
with
buckingham
and
did
they
not
start
with
flushed
cheeks
to
hear
your
laugh
ring
forth
from
corner
of
the
wood
was
your
advice
as
to
the

asked

in

flying
the

ears
of

came
he
tears
on

to
reveal
to
you
the
sorrows
of
his
nymphs
of

what
said
boileau
to
you
to
you
o
lettered
faun
who
once
with

in

eclogue
held

charming

have
you
seen

you

he
perchance
at

here
the
thinker
homeward
went
has
he
who
seeing
souls
all
naked
could
not
fear
your
nudity
in
his
inquiring
mind
confronted
you
with
man
under
the
branches
thus
did
i
speak
to
him
he
no
answer
gave
i
shook
my
head
and
moved
myself
away
then
from
the
copses
and
from
secret
caves
hid
in
the
wood
methought
a
ghostly
voice
came
forth
and
woke
an
echo
in
my
souls
as
in
the
hollow
of
an
amphora
imprudent
poet
thus
it
seemed
to
say
what
dost
thou
here
leave
the
forsaken
fauns
in
peace
beneath
their
trees
dost
thou
not
know
poet
that
ever
it
is
impious
deemed
in
desert
spots
where
drowsy
shades
repose
though
love
itself
might
prompt
thee
to
shake
down
the
moss
that
hangs
from
ruined
centuries
and
with
the
vain
noise
of
throe
words
to
mar
the
recollections
of
the
dead
then
to
the

all
enwrapped
in

i
hurried
dreaming
of
the
vanished
days
and
still
behind
me
hieroglyph

of

the
lonely
faun
held
to
his
laughter
through

i
went
my

in

pondering
on

that

my

with

in

went
forth
into
great
silence
and
great
night
by
iceland
and
norway
after
him
gloom
swallowed
up
the
universe
he
stood
a
sovran
kingdomless
a
lonely
ghost
confronted
with
immensity
he
saw
the
awful
infinite
at
whose
portal
pale
lightning
sinks
dying
darkness
skeleton
whose
joints
are
nights
and
utter
formlessness
moving
confusedly
in
the
horrible
dark
inscrutable
and
blind
no
star
was
there
yet
something
like
a
haggard
gleam
no
sound
but
the
dull
tide
of
darkness
and
her
dumb
and
fearful
shudder
is
the
tomb
he
said
god
is
beyond
three
steps
he
took
then
cried
was
deathly
as
the
grave
and
not
a
voice
responded
nor
came
any
breath
to
sway
the
snowy
mantle
with
unsullied
white
emboldening
the
spectral
wanderer
sudden
he
marked
how
like
a
gloomy
star
a
spot
grew
broad
upon
his
livid
robe
slowly
it
widened
raying
darkness
forth
and
canute
proved
it
with
his
spectral
hands
it
was
a
drop
of
blood

but
he
saw
nothing
space
was
black
no

said
canute
raising
his
proud
head
there
fell
a
second
stain
beside
the
first
then
it
grew
larger
and
the
cimbrian
chief
stared
at
the
thick
vague
darkness
and
saw
naught
still
as
a
bloodhound
follows
on
his
track
sad
he
went
on
fell
a
third
red
stain
on
the
white
he
had
never
fled
howbeit
canute
forward
went
no
more
but
turned
on
that
side
where
the
sword
arm
hangs
a
drop
of
blood
as
if
athwart
a
dream
fell
on
the
shroud
and
reddened
his
right
hand
then
as
in
reading
one
turns
back
a
page
a
second
time
he
changed
his
course
and
turned
to
the
dim
left
there
fell
a
drop
of
blood
canute
drew
back
trembling
to
be
alone
and
wished
he
had
not
left
his
burial
couch
but
when
a
fell
again
he
stopped
stooped
his
pale
head
and
tried
to
make
a
prayer
then
fell
a
drop
and
the
prayer
died
away
in
savage
terror
darkly
he
moved
on
a
hideous
spectre
hesitating
white
and
ever
as
he
went
a
drop
of
blood
implacably
from
the
darkness
broke
away
and
stained
that
awful
whiteness
he
beheld
shaking
as
doth
a
poplar
in
the
wind
those
stains
grow
darker
and
more
numerous
another
and
another
and
another
they
seem
to
light
up
that
funereal
gloom
and
mingling
in
the
folds
of
that
white
sheet
made
it
a
cloud
of
blood
he
went
and
went
and
still
from
that
unfathomable
vault
the
red
blood
dropped
upon
him
drop
by
drop
always
for
ever
without
noise
as
though
from
the
black
feet
of
some
corpse
alas
who
wept
those
formidable
tears
the
infinite
toward
heaven
of
the
good
attainable

canute
went
on

ever
walking
came
to
a
closed
door
that
from
beneath
showed
a

he
looked
down
upon
his
for
that
was

was

the

from

none

the

it

there

a

a

would
appear

bear

were

the

gazers
could
descry
the
blackened
hall
lit
up

brilliantly
none
dared

and
this
the
reason
why
iv
the
custom
of
lusace
when
died
a
noble
marquis
of
lusace
was
custom
for
the
heir
who
filled
his
place
before
assuming
princely
pomp
and
power
to
sup
one
night
in
corbus
olden
tower
from
this
weird
meal
he
passed
to
the
degree
of
prince
and
margrave
nor
could
ever
he
be
thought
brave
knight
or
she

reckoned
of

till
they

of
ages
gone

nest
alone
of
its
dead
masters
ancient
was
the

the

a

they
from

owed

which
he
was

carry
on
the

decree
it
was
that
he
should
pass
alone
the
night
which
made
him
king
as
in
their
solemn
sight
just
at
the
forest
edge
a
clerk
was
met
with
wine
in
sacred
cup
and
purpose
set
a
wine
mysterious
which
the
heir
must
drink
to
cause
deep
slumber
till
next
day
soft
brink
then
to
the
castle
tower
he
wends
his
way
and
finds
a
supper
laid
with
rich
display
he
sups
and
sleeps
then
to
his
slumbering
eyes
the
shades
of
kings
from

none
dare
the

to
enter
on
this
night

when
the
morning
dawns
crowds
are
in

the
dreamer
to
deliver
whom
half
dazed
and
with
the
visions
of
the
night
amazed
they
to
the
old
church
take
where
rests
the
dust
of
borivorus
then
the
bishop
must
with
fervent
blessings
on
his
eyes
and
mouth
put
in
his
hands
the
stony
hatchets
both
with
which
even
like
death
impartially
struck

with
the

in

without

claw
the
other
one
the
will
controlling
yet
to
mass
they
both
went
still
and
on
the
rosary
told
their
beads
each
day
but
none
the
less
the
world
believed
that
they
unto
the
powers
of
hell
their
souls
had
sold
even
in
whispers
men
each
other
told
the
details
of
the
pact
which
they
had
signed
with
that
dark
power
the
foe

yet
lived
they
side
by

in

state
and
close

all
the
people
near
from

dwelt
in
abject
fear
mastered
by
them
their
figures
darkly
grand
had
ruddy
reflex
from
the
wasted
land
and
fires
and
towns
they
sacked
besides
the
one
like

as
fine

spread
their
fame
declaring
them
divine
until
each

in

fine

met
with
praise
the
ancient
hierarch
in
those
old
days
had
custom
strange
a
now
forgotten
thing
it
was
a
european
plan
that
king
of
france
was
marquis
and
th
imperial
head
of
germany
was
duke
there
was
no
need
to
class
the
other
kings
but
barons
they
obedient
vassals
unto
rome
their
stay
the
king
of
poland
was
but
simple
knight
yet
now
for
once
had
strange
unwonted
right
and
as
exception
to
the
common
state
this
one
sarmatian
king
was
held
as
great
as
german
emperor
and
each
knew
how
his
evil
part
to
play
nor
mercy
show
the
german
had
one
aim
it
was
to
take
all
land
he
could
and
it
his
own
to
make
the
pole
already
having
baltic
shore
seized
celtic
ports
still
needing
more
and
more
on
all
the
northern
sea
his
crafts
roused
fear
iceland
beheld
his
demon
navy
near
antwerp
the
german
burnt
and
prussias
twain
bowed
to
the
yoke
the
polish
king
was
fain
to
help
the
russian
spotocus
his
aid
was
like
the
help
that
in
their
common
trade
a
sturdy
butcher
gives
a
weaker
one
the
king
it
is
who
seizes
and
this
done
the
pillages
usurping
right
in
war
teutonic
settled
but
by
might
the
king
in
jutland
cynic
footing
gains
the
weak
coerced
the
while
with
cunning
pains
the
strong
are
duped
but
is
a
law
they
make
that
their
accord
themselves
should
never
break
from
arctic
seas
to
cities
transalpine
their
hideous
talons
curved
for
sure
rapine
scrape
and
the
mournful
continent
their
plans
succeed
and
each
is
well
content
thus
under
satan
all
paternal
care
they
brothers
are
this
royal
bandit
pair
oh
noxious
conquerors
with
transient
rule
chimera
heads
ambition
can
but
fool
their
misty
minds
but
harbor
rottenness
loathsome
and
fetid
and
all
barrenness
their
deeds
to
ashes
turn
and
the
mystic
skeleton
is
theirs
to
dread
the
daring
german
and
the
cunning
pole
noted
a
woman
had
control
of
lands
and
watched
mahaud
like
evil
spies
and
from
the
cruel
mouth
with
dyes
of
wrath
empurpled
came
these
words
of
late
the
empire
wearies
of
the
wallet
weight
hung
at
its
back
this
high
and
low
lusace
whose
hateful
load
grows
heavier
apace
that
now
a
woman
holds
its
ruler
place
threatening
and
blood
suggesting
every
word
the
watchful
pole
was
silent
but
he
heard
two
monstrous
dangers
but
the
heedless
one
babbles
and
smiles
and
bids
all
care
begone
likes
lively
speech
while
all
the
poor
she
makes
to
love
her
and
the
taxes
off
she
takes
a
life
of
dance
and
pleasure
she
has
known
a
woman
always
in
her
jewelled
crown
it
is
the
pearl
she
loves
not
cutting
gems
for
these
can
wound
and
mark
men
diadems
she
pays
the
hire
of
homer
copyists
and
in
the
courts
of
love
presiding
lists
quite
recently
unto
her
court
have
come
two
men
unknown
their
names
or
native
home
their
rank
or
race
but
one
plays
well
the
lute
the
other
is
a
troubadour
both
suit
the
taste
of
mahaud
when
on
summer
eve
opened
windows
they
obtain
her
leave
to
sing
upon
the
terrace
and
relate
the
charming
tales
that
do
with
music
mate
in
august
the
moravians
have
their
fête
but
it
is
radiant
june
in
which
lusace
must
consecrate
her
noble
margrave
race
thus
in
the
weird
and
old
ancestral
tower
for
mahaud
now
has
come
the
fateful
hour
the
lonely
supper
which
her
state
decrees
what
matters
this
to
flowers
and
birds
and
trees
and
clouds
and
fountains
that
the
people
may
still
bear
their
yoke
have
kings
to
rule
alway
the
water
flows
the
wind
in
passing
by
in

takes
up
the
questioning
cry
vii
the

the
old
stupendous
hall

but
one

in

dusk
it
seems
that
more

recede
in

unlimited
at

there
is
a

spread

in

behold

is
arranged

the

were
carved
in

by

with

reclaim

there
a

with
likeness

displayed
amid

terror
crouches
in

so
high

who

with

look
up

will
haply
seem
to

the

of

has
something
more
sepulchral

more
dread
than
lurid
glare
from

with
stately
daïs
near
two
rows
of

a

on

with

at

the

stern
and
cold

erect
and
haughty

these

are
dreams
of
horror
clothed
in
brass
which
from
profoundest
depths
of
evil
pass
with
futile
aim
to
dare
the
infinite
souls
tremble
at
the
silent
spectre
sight
as
if
in
this
mysterious
cavalcade
they
saw
the
weird
and
mystic
halt
was
made
of
them
who
at
the
coming
dawn
of
day
would
fade
and
from
their
vision
pass
away

stranger

in

masks

the
staves
of
hideous
biers

not
their
joints
more
strong
than
are
the
joinings
of
these

long
scaled
gauntlet

like
worms
that

stony
feet

for
the
charnel

only
meet
the
pikes

carved
and
seem
to
be
too
heavy

the
shapes
defiantly
sit
proudly
in
the

perforce
the

united

there
history
here
each
coat
of

is
representant
of
some
stirring
tale
each
escutcheon

to
show
a
vision
of
the

it
we
know
here

the

barbaric
lords
who
amid
war
rapine
bore
gilded

upon
their
banners
still
painted
on

to

how
mute

were
heard
like
savage

gnashing

the
helmets

have
not
a

and
all
the

the

are
stranded
now
in
helplessness
alway
to
see
the
shadows
still
prolonged
that
seem
to
take
at
night
the
image
of
a
dream

two
great
files

from

afar

the

between
their

the

of
this

dread
all
waiting
signal
of
the
judgment
day
in

in

king
who
on
the
earth
had
found
only
twelve
knights
to
grace
his
table
round
the

an
assembly
of
strange
things
of
horrors
such
as
nightmare
only
brings
asps
and
spread
eagles
without
beak
or
feet
sirens
and
mermaids
here
and
dragons
meet
and
antlered

fearful
things
of
monstrous
fancy
born
upon
the
rigid
form
of
morion
sheen
winged
lions
and
the
cerberus
are
seen
and
serpents
winged

things
made
to
fright
the
timid
foe
alone
by
sense
of
sight
some
leaning
forward
and
the
others
back
they
looked
a
growing
forest
that
did
lack
no
form
of
terror
but
these
things
of
dread
that
once
on
barons
helms
the
battle
led
beneath
the
giant
banners
now
are
still
as
if
they
gaped
and
found
the
time
but
ill
wearied
the
ages
passed
so
slowly
by
and
that
the
gory
dead
no
more
did
lie
beneath
their
feet
pined
for
the
the
trumpet
clash
the
carnage
and
the
strife
yawning
to
taste
again
their
dreadful
life
like
tears
upon
the
palfreys
muzzles
were
the
hard
reflections
of
the
metal
there
from
out
these
spectres
ages
past
exhumed
and
as
their
shadows
on
the
loomed
cast
by
the
trembling
light
each
figure
wan
seemed
growing
and
a
monstrous
shape
to
don
so
that
the
double
range
of
horrors
made
the
darkened
zenith
clouds
of
blackest
shade
that
shaped
themselves
to
profiles
terrible
all
motionless
the
coursers
horrible
that
formed
a
legion
lured
by
death
to
war
these
men
and
horses
masked
how
dread
they
are
absorbed
in
shadows
of
the
eternal
shore
among
the
living
all
their
tasks
are
silent
they
seem
all
mystery
to
brave
these
sphinxes
whom
no
beacon
light
can
save
upon
the
threshold
of
the
gulf
so
near
as
if
they
faced
the
great
enigma
here
ready
with
hoofs
between
the
pillars
blue
to
strike
out
sparks
and
combats
to
renew
choosing
for
the
shades
below
which
they
provoked

eviradnus
motionless
and
lone
the
hero
is
within

nears
the

show
in

the

gilt

for

thirsts

there
must
stay
one
drop
in
emptied
glass
and
betray
the
fact
that
some
one
living

been
here
straight
to

he
pauses
near

which
is
next
the

shining

seizes
the
rider
plucks
the
phantom
knight
to
pieces
all
in
vain
its
panoply
and
pallid
shining
to
his
practised
eye
then
he
conveys
the
severed
iron
remains
to
corner
of
the
hall
where
darkness
reigns
against
the
wall
he
lays
the
armor
low
in
dust
and
gloom
like
hero
vanquished
now
but
keeping
lance
and
shield
so
old
mounts
to
the
empty

and
behold
a

eviradnus
has
become
like
to
the
others
in

frigid
home

down
scarce
breathing
seemed
maintained
throughout
the

a
silence
reigned
xi
a
little
music

like
hum

unseen
nests
we
hear
a
mirthful
buzz
of
voices
coming
near
of
footsteps

from
the
trembling
trees
and
now
the
forest
all
receives
a
flood
of
moonlight
and
there
gently
floats
the
sound
of
a
guitar
of
inspruck
notes
which
blend
with
chimes
vibrating
to
the
hand
of
tiny
bell
where
sounds
a
grain
of
sand

mixes
with
the
melody
and
vaguely
melts
to

trembled
and
was
hushed

stopped
like

and
all
was
still
xii
great
joss
and
little
zeno
quite
suddenly
there
showed
across
the
door
three
heads
which
all
a
festive
aspect
wore
two
men
were
there
and
dressed
in
cloth
of
gold
a
woman
of
the
men
one
might
have
told
some
thirty
years
the
other
younger
seemed
was
tall
and
fair
and
from
his
shoulder
gleamed
a
gay
guitar
with
ivy
leaves
enlaced
the
other
man
was
dark
but
and
small
at
the
first
glance
they
seemed
to
be
but
made
of
perfume
and
frivolity
handsome
they
were
but
through
their
comely
mien
a
grinning
demon
might
be
clearly
seen
april
has
flowers
where
lurk
the
slugs
between
big
joss
and
little
zeno
pray
come
here
look
now
how
dreadful
can
i
help
but
fear
madame
mahaud
was
speaker
moonlight
there
caressingly
enhanced
her
beauty
rare
making
it
shine
and
tremble
as
if
she
so
soft
and
gentle
were
of
things
that
be
of
air
created
and
are
brought
and
by
heavenly
flashes
now
she
spoke
again
certes
is
heavy
purchase
of
a
throne
to
pass
the
night
here
utterly
alone
had
you
not
slyly
come
to
guard
me
now
i
should
have
died
of
fright
outright
i
know
the
moonbeams
through
the
open
door
did
fall
and
shine
upon
the
figure
next
the
wall
said
zeno
if
i
played
the
marquis
part

send
this
rubbish
to
the
auction
mart
out
of
the
heap
should
come
the
finest
wine
pleasure
and
were
it
all
mine
and
then
with
scornful
hand
he
touched
the
thing
and
made
the
metal
like
a
soul
cry
ring
he
laughed
the
gauntlet
trembled
at
his
stroke
let
rest
my
ancestors

then
murmuring
added
she
for
you
are
much
too
small
their
noble
armor
here
to
touch
and
zeno
paled
but
joss
with
laugh
exclaimed
why
all
these
good
black
men
so
grandly
named
are
only
nests
for
mice
by
jove
although
they
lifelike
look
and
terrible
we
know
what
is
within

listen
and
you

proudly
named

the
end
not

only
now
remain
a
peaceful
nibbling
rat
to
calmly
pierce
a
prince
noble
armor
proud
and
fierce
sing
if
you
will
but
do
not
speak
so
loud
besides
such
things
as
these
said
fair
mahaud
in
your
condition
are
not
understood
well
said
made
answer
zeno
is
a
place
of
wonders
i
see
serpents
and
can
trace
vampires
and
monsters
swarming
that
arise
in
mist
through
chinks
to
meet
the
gazer
eyes
then
mahaud
shuddered
and
she
said
the
wine
the
abbé
made
me
drink
as
task
of
mine
will
soon
enwrap
me
in
the
soundest
sleep
swear
not
to
leave
me
that
you
here
will
keep
i
swear
cried
joss
and
zeno
i
also
but
now
at
once
to
supper
let
us
go
xiii
they
sup
with
laugh
and
song
they
to
the
table
went
said
mahaud
gayly
it
is
my
intent
to
make
joss
chamberlain
zeno
shall
be
a
constable
supreme
of
high
degree
all
three
were
joyous
and
were
fair
to
see
joss
ate
and
zeno
drank
on
stools
the
pair
with
mahaud
musing
in
the
regal
chair
the
sound
of
separate
leaf
we
do
not
note
and
so
their
babble
seemed
to
idly
float
and
leave
no
thought
behind
now
and
again
joss
his
guitar
made
trill
with
plaintive
strain
or
tyrolean
air
and
lively
tales
they
told
mingled
with
mirth
all
free
and
frank
and
bold
said
mahaud
do
you
know
how
fortunate
you
are
yes
we
are
young
at
any
rate
lovers
half
crazy
this
is
truth
at
least
and
more
for
you
know
latin
like
a
priest
and
joss
sings
well
ah
yes
our
master
true
yields
us
these
gifts
beyond
the
measure
due
your
master
who
is
he
mahaud
exclaimed
satan
we
say
but
sin
you
think
him
named
said
zeno
veiling
words
in
raillery
do
not
laugh
thus
she
said
with
dignity
peace
zeno
joss
you
speak
my
chamberlain
madame
viridis
countess
of
milan
was
deemed
superb
diana
on
the
mount
dazzled
the
shepherd
boy
ever
we
count
the
isabel
of
saxony
so
fair
and
cleopatra
beauty
all
so
rare
aspasia
too
that
must
with
theirs
compare
that
praise
of
them
no
fitting
language
hath
divine
was
rhodope
and
venus
wrath
was
such
at
erylesis
perfect
throat
she
dragged
her
to
the
forge
where
vulcan
smote
her
beauty
on
his
anvil
well
as
much
as
star
transcends
a
sequin
and
just
such
as
temple
is
to
i
say
you
do
eclipse
their
beauty
every
way
those
airy
sprites
that
from
the
azure
smile
peris
and
elfs
the
while
they
men
beguile
have
brows
less
youthful
pure
than
yours
besides
dishevelled
they
whose
shaded
beauty
hides
in
clouds
said
mahaud
you
but
sing
too
well
then
joss
more
homage
sought
to
bring
if
i
were
angel
under
said
he
or
girl
or
demon
i
would
seek
to
be
by
you
instructed
in
all
art
and
grace
and
as
in
school
but
take
a
scholar
place
highness
you
are
a
fairy
bright
whose
hand
for
sceptre
vile
gave
up
your
proper
wand
fair
mahaud
mused
then
said
be
silent
now
you
seem
to
watch
me
little
is
i
know
only
that
from
bohemia
joss
doth
come
and
that
in
poland
zeno
hath
his
home
but
you
amuse
me
i
am
rich
you
poor
what
boon
shall
i
confer
and
make
secure
what
gift
ask
of
me
poets
what
you
will
and
i
will
grant
it
promise
to
fulfil
a
kiss
said
joss
a
kiss
and
anger
fraught
amazed
at
minstrel
having
such
a
thought
while
flush
of
indignation
warmed
her
cheek
you
do
forget
to
whom
it
is
you
speak
she
cried
had
i
not
known
your
high
degree
should
i
have
asked
this
royal
boon
said
he
obtained
or
given
a
kiss
must
ever
be
no
gift
like
king
no
kiss
like
that
of
queen
queen
and
on
mahaud
face
a
smile
was
seen
xiv
after
supper
but
now
the
potion
proved
its
subtle
power
and
mahaud
heavy
eyelids
to
lower
zeno
with
finger
on
his
lip
looked
on
her
head
next
drooped
and
consciousness
was
gone
smiling
she
slept
serene
and
very
fair
he
took
her
hand
which
fell
all
unaware
she
sleeps
said
zeno
now
let
chance
or
fate
decide
for
us
which
has
the
marquisate
and
which
the
girl
upon
their
faces
now
a
hungry
tiger
look
began
to
show
my
brother
let
us
speak
like
men
of
sense
said
joss
while
mahaud
dreams
in
innocence
we
grasp
all
here
and
hold
the
foolish
thing
our
friend
below
to
us
success
will
bring
he
keeps
his
word
is
thanks
to
him
i
say
no
awkward
chance
has
marred
our
plans
all
has
succeeded
now
no
human
power
can
take
from
us
this
woman
and
her
dower
let
us
conclude
to
wrangle
and
to
fight
for
just
a
yes
or
no
or
to
prove
right
the
arian
doctrines
all
the
time
the
pope
laughs
in
his
sleeve
at
you
or
with
the
hope
some
damsel
with
a
tender
skin
and
milkwhite
dainty
hands
by
force
to
win
this
might
be
well
in
days
when
men
bore
loss
and
fought
for
latin
or
byzantine
cross
when
jack
and
rudolf
did
like
fools
contend
and
for
a
simple
wench
their
valor
spend
when
pepin
held
a
synod
at
leptine
and
times
than
now
were
much
less
wise
and
fine
we
do
no
longer
heap
up
quarrels
thus
but
better
know
how
projects
to
discuss
have
you
the
needful
dice
yes
here
they
wait
for
us
who
wins
shall
have
the
marquisate
loser
the
girl
agreed
a
noise
i
hear
only
the
wind
that
sounds
like
some
one
near
are
you
afraid
said
zeno
naught
i
fear
save
fasting
and
that
solid
earth
should
gape
let
throw
and
fate
decide
ere
time
escape
then
rolled
the
dice
is
four
was
joss
to
throw
six
and
i
neatly
win
you
see
and
lo
at
bottom
of
this
box
i
found
lusace
and
henceforth
my
orchestra
will
have
place
to
it
they
dance
taxes
i
raise
and
they
in
dread
of
rope
and
forfeit
well
will
pay
brass
shall
be
my
flutes
that
lead
where
gibbets
rise
the
imposts
grow
and
spread
said
zeno
i
the
girl
and
so
is
best
she
beautiful
said
joss
yes
is
confess
what
shall
you
do
with
her
asked
joss
i
know
make
her
a
corpse
said
zeno
marked
you
how
the
jade
insulted
me
just
now
too
small
she
called
me
such
the
words
her
lips
let
fall
i
say
that
moment
ere
the
dice
i
threw
had
yawning
hell
cried
out
son
for
you
the
chance
is
open
still
take
in
a
heap
the
fair
lusace
seven
towns
and
reap
the
corn
and
wine
and
oil
of
counties
ten
with
all
their
people
diligent
and
then
bohemia
with
its
silver
mines
and
now
the
lofty
land
whence
mighty
rivers
flow
and
not
a
brook
returns
add
to
these
counts
the
tyrol
with
its
lovely
azure
mounts
and
france
with
her
historic
come
now
decide
what
is
your
choice
must
be
i
should
have
answered
give
to
me
rather
than
france
bohemia
or
the
fair
blue
tyrol
i
my
choice
o
hell
declare
for
government
of
darkness
and
of
death
of
grave
and
worms
brother
this
woman
hath
as
marchioness
with
absurdity
set
forth
to
rule
frontier
bulwarks
of
the
north
in
any
case
to
us
a
danger
she
and
having
stupidly
insulted
me
is
needful
that
she
die
to
blurt
all
out
i
know
that
you
desire
her
without
doubt
the
flame
that
rages
in
my
heart
warms
yours
to
carry
out
these
subtle
plans
of
ours
we
have
become
as
gypsies
near
this
doll
you
as
her
page
i
dotard
to
control
pretended
gallants
changed
to
lovers
now
so
brother
this
being
fact
for
us
to
know
sooner
or
later
our
best
intent
about
her
we
should
quarrel
evident
is
it
our
compact
would
be
broken
through
there
is
one
only
thing
for
us
to
do
and
that
is
kill
her
logic
very
clear
said
musing
joss
but
what
of
blood
shed
here
then
zeno
stooped
and
lifted
from
the
ground
an
edge
of
carpet
groped
until
he
found
a
ring
which
pulled
an
opening
did
disclose
with
deep
abyss
beneath
from
it
there
rose
the
odor
rank
of
crime
joss
walked
to
see
while
zeno
pointed
to
it
silently
but
eyes
met
eyes
and
joss
well
pleased
was
fain
by
nod
of
head
to
make
approval
plain
xv
the
oubliettes
if
sulphurous
light
had
shone
from
this
vile
well
one
might
have
said
it
was
a
mouth
of
hell
so
large
the
trap
that
by
some
sudden
blow
a
man
might
backward
fall
and
sink
below
who
looked
could
see
a
harrow
threatening
teeth
but
lost
in
night
was
everything
beneath
partitions
have
a
reddened
smear
and
terror
unrelieved
is
master
here
one
feels
the
place
has
secret
histories
replete
with
dreadful
murderous
mysteries
and
that
this
sepulchre
forgot
is
home
of
trailing
ghosts
that
grope
their
way
along
the
walls
where
spectre
reptiles
crawl
our
fathers
fashioned
for
us
after
all
some
useful
things
said
joss
then
zeno
spoke
i
know
what
corbus
hides
beneath
its
cloak
i
and
the
osprey
know
the
castle
old
and
what
in
bygone
times
the
justice
bold
and
are
you
sure
that
mahaud
will
not
wake
her
eyes
are
closed
as
now
my
fist
i
make
she
is
in
mystic
and
unearthly
sleep
the
potion
still
its
power
her
must
keep
but
she
will
surely
wake
at
break
of
day
in
darkness
what
will
all
the
courtiers
say
when
in
the
place
of
her
they
find
two
men
to
them
we
will
declare
ourselves
and
then
they
at
our
feet
will
fall
where
leads
this
hole
to
where
the
crow
makes
feast
and
torrents
roll
to
desolation
let
us
end
it
now
these
young
and
handsome
men
had
seemed
to
grow
deformed
and
hideous
so
doth
foul
black
heart
disfigure
man
till
beauty
all
depart
so
to
the
hell
within
the
human
face
transparent
is
they
nearer
move
apace
and
mahaud
soundly
sleeps
as
in
a
bed
to
work
joss
seizes
her
and
holds
her
head
supporting
her
beneath
her
arms
in
his
and
then
he
dared
to
plant
a
monstrous
kiss
upon
her
rosy
lips
while
zeno
bent
before
the
massive
chair
and
with
intent
her
robe
disordered
as
he
raised
her
feet
her
dainty
ankles
thus
their
gaze
to
meet
and
while
the
mystic
sleep
was
all
profound
the
pit
gaped
wide
like
grave
in
burial
ground
xvi
what
they
attempt
becomes
difficult
bearing
the
sleeping
mahaud
they
moved
now
silent
and
bent
with
heavy
step
and
slow
zeno
faced
darkness
joss
turned
towards
the
light
so
that
the
hall
to
joss
was
quite
in
sight
sudden
he
stopped
and
zeno
what
now
called
but
joss
replied
not
though
he
seemed
appalled
and
made
a
sign
to
zeno
who
with
speed
looked
back
then
seemed
they
changed
to
stone
indeed
for
both
perceived
that
in
the
vaulted
hall
one
of
the
grand
old
knights
ranged
by
the
wall
descended
from
his
horse
like
phantom
he
moved
with
a
horrible
tranquillity
masked
by
his
helm
towards
them
he
came
his
tread
made
the
floor
tremble
and
one
might
have
said
a
spirit
of
th
abyss
was
here
between
them
and
the
pit
he
came
a
barrier
seen
then
said
with
sword
in
hand
and
visor
down
in
measured
tones
that
had
sepulchral
grown
as
tolling
bell
stop
sigismond
and
you
king
ladisläus
at
those
words
though
few
they
dropped
the
marchioness
and
in
such
a
way
that
at
their
feet
like
rigid
corpse
she
lay
the
deep
voice
speaking
from
the
visor
grate
proceeded
while
the
two
in
abject
state
cowered
low
joss
paled
by
gloom
and
dread
and
zeno
trembled
like
a
yielding
mast
you
two
who
listen
now
must
recollect
the
compact
all
your
suspect
is
this
satan
god
of
darkened
sphere
the
king
of
gloom
and
winds
that
bring
things
drear
alliance
make
with
my
two
brothers
dear
the
emperor
sigismond
and
polish
king
named
ladisläus
i
to
surely
bring
aid
and
protection
to
them
both
alway
and
never
to
absent
myself
or
say
i
weary
and
yet
more
i
being
lord
of
sea
and
land
to
sigismond
award
the
earth
to
ladisläus
all
the
sea
with
this
condition
that
they
yield
to
me
when
i
the
forfeit
claim
the
king
his
head
but
shall
the
emperor
give
his
soul
instead
said
joss
he
spectre
with
flashing
eyes
and
art
thou
satan
come
to
us
surprise
much
less
am
i
and
yet
much
more
oh
kings
of
crimes
and
plots
your
day
is
but
i
your
lives
will
only
take
beneath
the
talons
black
your
souls
let
stay
to
wrestle
still
the
pair
looked
stupefied
and
crushed
exchanging
looks
was
zeno
cried
speaking
to
joss
now
who
who
can
it
be
joss
stammered
yes
no
refuge
can
i
see
the
doom
is
on
us
but
oh
spectre
say
who
are
you
i
the
judge
then
mercy
pray
the
voice
replied
god
guides
his
chosen
hand
to
be
th
avenger
in
your
path
to
stand
your
hour
has
sounded
nothing
now
indeed
can
change
for
you
the
destiny
decreed
irrevocable
quite
yes
i
looked
on
ah
little
did
you
think
that
any
one
to
this
unwholesome
gloom
could
knowledge
bring
that
joss
a
kaiser
was
and
zeno
king
you
spoke
just
now
but
why
too
late
to
plead
the
forfeit
due
and
hope
should
all
be
dead
incurables
for
you
i
am
the
grave
oh
miserable
men
that
naught
can
save
yes
sigismond
a
kaiser
is
and
you
a
king
o
ladisläus
it
is
true
you
thought
of
god
but
as
a
wheel
to
roll
your
chariot
on
you
who
have
king
control
poland
and
its
many
towns
so
strong
you
milan
duke
to
whom
at
once
belong
the
gold
and
iron
crowns
you
emperor
made
by
rome
a
son
of
hercules
is
said
and
you
of
spartibor
and
your
two
crowns
are
shining
lights
and
yet
your
shadow
frowns
from
every
mountain
land
to
trembling
sea
you
are
at
giddy
heights
twin
powers
to
be
a
glory
and
a
force
for
all
that
great
but
the
purple
canopy
of
state
th
expanding
and
triumphant
arch
you
prize
royal
power
that
sacred
veils
disguise
beneath
your
crowns
of
pearls
and
jewelled
stars
beneath
your
exploits
terrible
and
wars
you
sigismond
have
but
a
monster
been
and
ladisläus
you
are
scoundrel
seen
oh
degradation
of
the
sceptre
might
and
swords
when
justice
has
a
hand
like
night
foul
and
polluted
and
before
this
thing
this
hydra
do
the
temple
hinges
swing
the
throne
becomes
the
haunt
of
all
things
base
oh
age
of
infamy
and
foul
disgrace
oh
starry
heavens
looking
on
the
shame
no
brow
but
reddens
with
resentful
flame
and
yet
the
silent
people
do
not
stir
oh
million
arms
what
things
do
you
deter
poor
sheep
whom
devour
have
you
not
nails
with
strong
desiring
power
to
rend
these
royalties
that
you
so
cower
but
two
are
taken
such
as
will
amaze
hell
itself
when
it
on
them
shall
gaze
ah
sigismond
and
ladisläus
you
were
once
triumphant
splendid
to
the
view
stifling
with
your
prosperity
but
now
the
hour
of
retribution
lays
you
low
ah
do
the
vulture
and
the
crocodile
shed
tears
at
such
a
sight
i
fain
must
smile
it
seems
to
me
is
very
good
sometimes
that
princes
conquerors
stained
with
bandits
crimes
sparkling
with
splendor
wearing
crowns
of
gold
should
know
the
deadly
sweat
endured
of
old
that
of
jehoshaphat
should
sob
and
fear
and
after
crime
th
unclean
be
brought
to
bear
is
well
god
rules
and
thus
it
is
that
i
these
masters
of
the
world
can
make
to
lie
in
ashes
at
my
feet
and
this
was
he
who
reigned
and
this
a
caesar
known
to
be
in
truth
my
old
heart
aches
with
very
shame
to
see
such
cravens
with
such
noble
name
but
let
us
finish
what
has
just
passed
here
demands
thick
shrouding
and
the
time
is
near
th
accursed
dice
that
rolled
at
calvary
you
rolled
a
woman
murder
to
decree
it
was
a
dark
disastrous
game
to
play
but
not
for
me
a
moral
to
essay
this
moment
to
the
misty
grave
is
due
and
far
too
vile
and
little
human
you
to
see
your
evil
ways
your
fingers
lack
the
human
power
your
shocking
deeds
to
track
what
use
in
darkness
mirror
to
uphold
what
use
your
doings
to
be
now
retold
drink
of
the
darkness
greedy
of
the
ill
to
which
from
habit
you
attracted
still
not
recognizing
in
the
draught
you
take
the
stench
that
your
atrocities
must
make
i
only
tell
you
that
this
burdened
age
tires
of
your
highnesses
that
soil
its
page
and
of
your
villanies
and
this
is
why
you
now
must
swell
the
stream
that
passes
by
of
refuse
filth
oh
horrid
scene
to
show
of
these
young
men
and
that
young
girl
just
now
oh
can
you
really
be
of
human
kind
breathing
pure
air
of
heaven
do
we
find
that
you
are
men
oh
no
for
when
you
laid
foul
lips
upon
the
mouth
of
sleeping
maid
you
seemed
but
ghouls
that
had
come
furtively
from
out
the
tombs
only
a
horrid
lie
your
human
shape
of
some
strange
frightful
beast
you
have
the
soul
to
darkness
i
at
least
remit
you
now
oh
murderer
sigismond
and
ladisläus
pirate
both
beyond
release
two
demons
that
have
broken
ban
therefore
is
time
their
empire
over
man
and
converse
with
the
living
should
be
tyrants
behold
your
tomb
your
eyes
before
vampires
and
dogs
your
sepulchre
is
here
enter
he
pointed
to
the
gulf
so
near
all
terrified
upon
their
knees
they
fell
oh
take
us
not
in
your
dread
realm
to
dwell
said
sigismond
but
phantom
do
us
tell
what
thou
wouldst
have
from
us
we
will
obey
oh
mercy
is
for
mercy
now
we
pray
behold
us
at
your
feet
oh
spectre
dread
and
no
old
crone
in
feebler
voice
could
plead
than
ladisläus
did
but
not
a
word
said
now
the
figure
motionless
with
sword
in
hand
this
sovereign
soul
seemed
to
commune
with
self
beneath
his
metal
sheath
yet
soon
and
suddenly
with
tranquil
voice
said
he
princes
your
craven
spirit
wearies
me
no
phantom
only
man
am
arise
i
like
not
to
be
dreaded
otherwise
than
with
the
fear
to
which
i
used
know
me
for
it
is
eviradnus
that
you
see
xvii
the
club
as
from
the
mist
a
noble
pine
we
tell
grown
old
upon
the
heights
of
appenzel
when
morning
freshness
breathes
round
all
the
wood
so
eviradnus
now
before
them
stood
opening
his
visor
which
at
once
revealed
the
snowy
beard
it
had
so
well
concealed
thin
sigismond
was
still
as
dog
at
gaze
but
ladisläus
leaped
and
howl
did
raise
and
laughed
and
gnashed
his
teeth
till
like
a
cloud
that
sudden
bursts
his
rage
was
all
avowed
is
but
an
old
man
after
all
he
cried
then
the
great
knight
who
looked
at
both
replied
oh
kings
an
old
man
of
my
time
can
cope
with
two
much
younger
ones
of
yours
i
hope
to
mortal
combat
i
defy
you
both
singly
or
if
you
will
i
nothing
loth
with
two
together
to
contend
choose
here
from
out
the
heap
what
weapon
shall
appear
most
fit
as
you
no
cuirass
wear
i
see
i
will
take
off
my
own
for
all
must
be
in
order
perfect
your
punishment
then
eviradnus
true
to
his
intent
stripped
to
his
utrecht
jerkin
but
the
while
he
calmly
had
disarmed
with
dexterous
guile
had
ladisläus
seized
a
knife
that
lay
upon
the
damask
cloth
and
slipped
away
his
shoes
then
barefoot
swiftly
silently
he
crept
behind
the
knight
with
arm
held
high
but
eviradnus
was
of
all
aware
and
turned
upon
the
murderous
weapon
there
and
twisted
it
away
then
in
a
trice
his
strong
colossal
hand
grasped
like
a
vice
the
neck
of
ladisläus
who
the
blade
now
dropped
over
his
eyes
a
misty
shade
showed
that
the
royal
dwarf
was
near
to
death
traitor
said
eviradnus
in
his
wrath
i
rather
should
have
hewn
your
limbs
away
and
left
you
crawling
on
your
stumps
i
say
but
now
die
fast
ghastly
with
starting
eyes
the
king
without
a
cry
or
struggle
dies
one
dead
but
lo
the
other
stands
defiant
for
the
knight
when
he
unlaced
his
cuirass
had
his
trusty
sword
laid
down
and
sigismond
now
grasps
it
as
his
own
the
laughed
at
the
beard
and
sword
in
hand
a
murderer
glad
appeared
crossing
his
arms
he
cried
is
my
turn
now
and
the
black
mounted
knights
in
solemn
row
were
judges
of
the
strife
before
them
lay
the
sleeping
mahaud
and
not
far
away
the
fatal
pit
near
which
the
champion
knight
with
evil
emperor
must
contend
for
right
though
weaponless
he
was
and
yawned
the
pit
expectant
which
should
be
engulfed
in
it
now
we
shall
see
for
whom
this
ready
grave
said
sigismond
you
dog
whom
naught
can
save
aware
was
eviradnus
that
if
he
turned
for
a
blade
unto
the
armory
he
would
be
instant
pierced
what
can
he
do
the
moment
is
for
him
supreme
but
lo
he
glances
now
at
ladisläus
dead
and
with
a
smile
triumphant
and
yet
dread
and
air
of
lion
caged
to
whom
is
shown
some
loophole
of
escape
he
bends
him
down
ha
ha
no
other
club
than
this
i
need
he
cried
as
seizing
in
his
hands
with
speed
the
dead
king
heels
the
body
lifted
high
then
to
the
frightened
emperor
he
came
nigh
and
made
him
shake
with
horror
and
with
fear
the
weapon
all
so
ghastly
did
appear
the
head
became
the
stone
to
this
strange
sling
of
which
the
body
was
the
potent
string
and
while
was
brandished
in
a
deadly
way
the
dislocated
arms
made
monstrous
play
with
hideous
gestures
as
now
upside
down
the
bludgeon
corpse
a
giant
force
had
grown
is
well
said
eviradnus
and
he
cried
arrange
between
yourselves
you
two
allied
if
were
extinguished
surely
it
by
such
a
contest
might
be
all
relit
from
kindling
spark
struck
out
from
dead
king
brow
to
death
a
living
emperor
now
and
sigismond
thus
met
and
horrified
recoiled
to
near
the
unseen
opening
wide
the
human
club
was
raised
and
struck
again
and
eviradnus
did
alone
remain
all
but
he
heard
the
sound
of
spectres
two
falling
to
depths
profound
then
stooping
the
pit
he
gazed
below
and
as
now
he
murmured
low
tiger
and
jackal
meet
their
portion
here
is
well
together
they
should
disappear
xviii
daybreak
then
lifts
he
mahaud
to
the
ducal
chair
and
shuts
the
trap
with
noiseless
gentle
care
and
puts
in
order
everything
around
so
that
on
waking
naught
should
her
astound
no
drop
of
blood
the
thing
has
cost
mused
he
and
that
is
best
indeed
but
suddenly
some
distant
bells
clang
out
the
mountains
gray
have
scarlet
tips
proclaiming
dawning
day
the
hamlets
are
astir
and
crowds
come
out
bearing
fresh
branches
of
the
broom
about
to
seek
their
lady
who
herself
awakes
rosy
as
morn
just
when
the
morning
breaks
still
she
ponders
can
it
be
some
mystic
change
has
passed
for
her
to
see
one
old
man
in
the
place
of
two
quite
young
her
wondering
eyes
search
carefully
and
long
it
may
be
she
regrets
the
change
meanwhile
the
valiant
knight
salutes
her
with
a
smile
and
then
approaching
her
with
friendly
mien
says
madam

your
sleep
all

a

a

watches

what

the
clear
shine
of
waters
shadowed
by
the
birch
and
pine
what
lies
before
a
swan
with
silver

the
wave
that
murmurs
to
the
branch
swing
or
the
deep
garden
flowering
below
fair
as
an
angel
frozen
into
snow
the
royal
child
looks
on
and
hardly
seems
to
know
as
in
a
depth
of
glory
far
away
down
in
the
green
park
a
lofty
palace
lay
there
drank
the
deer
from
many
a
crystal
pond
and
the
starred
peacock
gemmed
the
shade
beyond
around
that
child
all
nature
shone
more
bright
her
innocence
was
as
an
added
light
rubies
and
diamonds
strewed
the
grass
she
trode
and
jets
of
sapphire
from
the
dolphins
flowed
still
at

side
she
holds
her
place
her
bodice
bright

set
with

lace
her
rich
robe
through
every
satin
fold
wanders
an
arabesque
in
threads
of
gold
from
its
green
urn
the
rose
unfolding
grand
weighs
down
the
exquisite
smallness
of
her
hand
and
when

child
bends
to
the
red
leafs
tip
her
laughing
nostril
and
her
carmine
lip
the
royal
flower
purpureal
kissing
there
hides

than

bright
and
fair
so
that

deceived
can
scarcely
speak
where
shows
the

where
the

from

she
there
heaven
in

her

a
prayer
yet
the

and
before
life
and
fate
poor
child
she
feels
herself
so
vaguely
great
with
stately
grace
she
gives
her
presence
high
to
dawn
to
spring
to
shadows
flitting
by
to
the
dark
sunset
glories
of
the
heaven
and
all
the
wild
magnificence
of
even
on
nature
waits
eternal
and
serene
with
all
the
graveness
of
a
little
queen
she
never
sees
a
man
but
on
his
knee
she
duchess
of
brabant
one
day
will
be
or
rule
sardinia
or
the
flemish
crowd
she
is
the
infanta
five
years
old
and
proud
thus
is
it
with
kings
children
for
they
wear
a
shadowy
circlet
on
their
forehead
fair
their
tottering
steps
are
towards
a
kingly
chair
calmly
she
waits
and
breathes
her
gathered
flower
till
one
shall
cull
for
her
imperial
power
already
her
eye
saith
it
is
my
right
even
love
flows
from
her
mingled
with
affright
if
some
one
seeing
her
so
fragile
stand
were
it
to
save
her
should
put
forth
his
hand
ere
he
had
made
a
step
or
breathed
a
vow
the
scaffold
shadow
were
upon
his
brow
while
the

laughs
beyond
the
bastion
thick
of
that
vast
palace
roman
catholic
whose
every
turret
like
a
mitre
shows
behind
the
lattice
something
dreadful
goes
men
shake
to
see
a
shadow
from
beneath
passing
from
pane
to
pane
like
vapory
wreath
pale
black
and
still
it
glides
from
room
to
room
in
the
same
spot
like
ghost
upon
a
tomb
or
glues
its
dark
brown
to
the
casement
wan
dim
shade
that
lengthens
as
the
night
draws
on
its
step
funereal
lingers
like
the
swing
of
passing
bell
is
death
or
else
the
king
is
he
the
man
by
whom
men
live
and
die
but
could
one
look
beyond
that
phantom
eye
as
by
the
wall
he
leans
a
little
space
and
see
what
shadows
fill
his
soul
dark
place
not
the
fair
child
the
waters
clear
the
flowers
golden
with
sunset
not
the
birds
the
bowers
no
that
eye
those
fatal
brows
that
keep
the
fathomless
brain
like
ocean
dark
and
deep
there
as
in
moving
mirage
should
one
find
a
fleet
of
ships
that
go
before
the
wind
on
the
foamed
wave
and
the
starlight
pale
the
strain
and
rattle
of
a
fleet
in
sail
and
through
the
fog
an
isle
on
her
white
rock
hearkening
from
far
the
thunder
coming
shock
still
by
the
water
edge
doth
silent
stand
the
infanta
with
the
in
her
hand
caresses
it
with
eyes
as
blue
as
heaven
sudden
a
breeze
such
breeze
as
panting
even
from
her
full
heart
flings
out
to
field
and
brake
ruffles
the
waters
bids
the
rushes
shake
and
makes
through
all
their
green
recesses
swell
the
massive
myrtle
and
the
asphodel
to
the
fair
child
it
comes
and
tears
away
on
its
strong
wing
the
from
the
spray
on
the
wild
waters
casts
it
bruised
and
torn
and
the
infanta
only
holds
a
thorn
frightened
perplexed
she
follows
with
her
eyes
into
the
basin
where
her
ruin
lies
looks
up
to
heaven
and
questions
of
the
breeze
that
had
not
feared
her
highness
to
displease
but
all
the
pond
is
changed
anon
so
clear
now
back
it
swells
as
though
with
rage
and
fear
a
mimic
sea
its
small
waves
rise
and
fall
and
the
poor
rose
is
broken
by
them
all
its
hundred
leaves
tossed
wildly
round
and
round
beneath
a
thousand
waves
are
whelmed
and
drowned

still

for
the
rude
waves
din
through
the
thin
roof
the
plashing
fall

something
terrible
is
couched
within
so
for

delight
the

bloom
for
song
for

so
fast
away
what
hath
she
done
within

of

what
foldeth
she
beneath

gray
and
hurries
home
and
hides
it
in

with
face
and
nervous
tread
what
hath
she
stolen
from
the
awful
dead
the
dawn
was
whitening
over
the

as
she
sat
pensive
touching
broken
chords
of
thought
while
the
hoarse
surge
howled
a
sad
concert
to
her
broken
words
ah
my
poor
husband
we
had
five
before
already
so
much
care
so
much
to
find
for
he
must
work
for
all
i
give
him
more
what
was
that
noise
his
step
ah
no
the
wind
that
i
should
be
afraid
of
him
i
love
i
have
done
ill
if
he
should
beat
me
now

would
not
blame
him
did
not
the
door
move
not
yet

sits
with
careful
brow
wrapped
in

inward
grief
nor

that
dash
against
his
prow
nor
the
black
cormorant
shrieking
on
the
shore
sudden
the
door
flies
open
wide
and
lets
noisily
in
the
scarcely
clear
and
the
good
fisher
dragging
his
damp
nets
stands
on
the
threshold
with
a
joyous
cheer
is
thou
she
cries
and
eager
as
a
lover
leaps
up
and
holds
her
husband
to
her
breast
her
greeting
kisses
all
his
vesture
cover
is
i
good
wife
and
his
broad
face
expressed
how
gay
his
heart
that
janet
love
made
light
what
weather
was
it
hard
your
fishing
bad
the
sea
was
like
a
nest
of
thieves
but
i
embrace
thee
and
my
heart
is
glad
there
was
a
devil
in
the
wind
that
blew
i
tore
my
net
caught
nothing
broke
my
line
and
once
i
thought
the
bark
was
broken
too
what
did
you
all
the
night
long
janet
mine
she
trembling
in
the
darkness
answered
i
oh
naught
i
sew
i
watch
i
was
afraid
the
waves
were
loud
as
thunders
from
the
sky
but
it
is
over
shyly
then
she
said
our

died
last
night
it
must
have
been

you
were
gone
she
left
two
little
ones
so
small
so

the
one
just

the
other
scarcely

the
man
looked
grave
and
in
the
corner
cast
his
old
fur
bonnet
wet
with
rain
and
sea
muttered
awhile
and
scratched
his
head
at
last

have
five
children

already
in
bad

we
must
sleep
sometimes

are

it

i
can

did

take
the

from

no

to

perhaps
so
little
they
can
neither
work
nor

go

they
will
be
frightened
sore
if
with
the

alone
they
waken

knocking
at

door
and
we
must
take
the
children
home

xiii
a
lion
in
his
jaws
caught
up
a
child
not
harming
it
and
to
the
woodland
wild
with
secret
streams
and
lairs
bore
off
his
prey
the
beast
as
one
might
cull
a
bud
in
may
it
was
a
rosy
boy
a
king
own

a
lad
with
bright
eyes
shining
wide
and
save
this
son
his
majesty
beside
had
but
one
girl
two
years
of
age
and
so
the
monarch
suffered
being
old
much
woe
his
heir
the
monster
prey
while
the
whole
land
in
dread
both
of
the
beast
and
king
did
stand
sore
terrified
were
all
by
came
a
knight
that
road
who
halted
asking
what
the
fright
they
told
him
and
he
spurred
straight
for
the
site
the
beast
was
seen
to
smile
ere
joined
they

the
man

monster
in
most
desperate
duel

the

the

stronger
was
and
tore
that
brave
breast
under
its
cuirass
scrunching
that
hero
till
he
sprawled
alas
beneath
his
shield
all
blood
and
mud
and
mess
whereat
the
lion
feasted
then
it
went
back
to
its
rocky
couch
and
slept
content
sudden
loud
cries
and
clamors
striking
out
qualm
to
the
heart
of
the
quiet
horn
and
shout
causing
the
solemn
wood
to
reel
with
rout
terrific
was
this
noise
that
rolled
before
it
seemed
a
squadron
nay
was
something
more
a
whole
battalion
sent
by
that
sad
king
with
force
of
arms
his
little
prince
to
bring
together
with
the

he
on

as

as

in

or

bristled
majestic
from
the
teeth
to
tail
and
shook
full
fifty
missiles
from
his
hide
but
no
heed
took
he
steadfastly
he
eyed
and
roared
a
roar
hoarse
vibrant
vengeful
dread
a
rolling
raging
peal
of
wrath
which
spread
making
the
thunder

who
thunders

this
is
what
was
viewed
in
town
dawn
coming
people
going
some
adown
praying
some
crying
pallid
cheeks
swift
feet
and
a
huge
lion
stalking
through
the
street
it
seemed
scarce
short
of
rash
impiety
to
cross
its
path
as
the
fierce
beast
went
by
so
to
the
palace
and
its
gilded
dome
with
stately
steps
unchallenged
did
he
roam
he
enters
it
within
those
walls
he
leapt
no
man
for
certes
though
he
raged
and
wept
his
majesty
like
all
close
shelter
kept
solicitous
to
live
holding
his
breath
specially
precious
to
the
realm
now
death
is
not
thus
viewed
by
honest
beasts
of
prey
and
when
the
lion
found
fled
away
ashamed
to
be
so
grand
man
being
so
base
he
muttered
to
himself
a
wretched
king
is
well
i
eat
his
boy
then
wandering
lordly
he
traversed
courts
and
corridors
paced
beneath
vaults
of
gold
on
shining
floors
glanced
at
the
throne
deserted
stalked
from
hall
to
hall
green
yellow
crimson
empty
all
rich
couches
void
soft
seats
unoccupied
and
as
he
walked
he
looked
from
side
to
side
to
find
some
pleasant
nook
for
his
repast
since
appetite
was
come
to
munch
at
last
the
princely
morsel
ah
what
sight
astounds
that
grisly
lounger
in
the
palace
grounds
an
alcove
on

gives
and
there
a
tiny
thing
forgot
in
the
general
fear
lulled
in
the
dreams
of
infancy
bathed
with
soft
sunlight
falling
brokenly
through
leaf
and
lattice
was
at
that
moment
waking
a
little
lovely
maid
most
dear
and
taking
the
prince
sister
all
alone
undressed
she
sat
up
singing
children
sing
so
best
charming
this
beauteous
and
so
the
beast
caught
sight
of
her
and
stopped
and
then
entered
the
floor
creaked
as
he
stalked
straight
in
above
the
playthings
by
the
little
bed
the
lion
put
his
shaggy
massive
head
dreadful
with
savage
might
and
lordly
scorn
more
dreadful
with
that
princely
prey
so
borne
which
she
quick
spying
brother
brother
cried
oh
my
own
brother
and
unterrified
she
gazed
upon
that
monster
of
the
wood
whose
yellow
balls

had
withstood
and
well
who
knows
what
thoughts
these
small

hold
she
rose
up
in

with

stroked
down
its

thou
