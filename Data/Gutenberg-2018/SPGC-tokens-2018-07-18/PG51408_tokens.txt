dear
sir
in
compliance
with
your
request
i
enclose
herewith
a
transcript
of
the
pertinent
sections
of
the
journal
of
david
bannerman
deceased
the
original
document
is
being
held
at
this
office
until
proper
disposition
can
be
determined
our
investigation
has
shown
no
connection
between
bannerman
and
any
organization
subversive
or
otherwise
so
far
as
we
can
learn
he
was
exactly
what
he
seemed
an
inoffensive
summer
resident
retired
with
a
small
independent
income
a
recluse
to
some
extent
but
well
spoken
of
by
local
tradesmen
and
other
neighbors
a
connection
between
bannerman
and
the
type
of
activity
that
concerns
your
department
would
seem
most
unlikely
the
following
information
is
summarized
from
the
earlier
parts
of
bannerman
journal
and
tallies
with
the
results
of
our
own
limited
inquiry
he
was
born
in
at
springfield
massachusetts
attended
public
school
there
and
was
graduated
from
harvard
college
in
his
studies
having
been
interrupted
by
two
years
military
service
he
was
wounded
in
action
in
the
argonne
receiving
a
spinal
injury
he
earned
a
doctorate
in
biology
delayed
of
his
war
injury
necessitated
hospitalization
from
to
he
taught
elementary
sciences
in
a
private
school
in
boston
he
published
two
textbooks
in
introductory
biology
and
in
he
retired
from
teaching
a
pension
and
a
modest
income
from
textbook
royalties
evidently
made
this
possible
aside
from
the
spinal
injury
which
caused
him
to
walk
with
a
stoop
his
health
is
said
to
have
been
fair
autopsy
findings
suggested
that
the
spinal
condition
must
have
given
him
considerable
pain
he
is
not
known
to
have
mentioned
this
to
anyone
not
even
his
physician
lester
morse
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
of
drug
addiction
or
alcoholism
at
one
point
early
in
his
journal
bannerman
describes
himself
as
a
naturalist
of
the
puttering
type
i
would
rather
sit
on
a
log
than
write
monographs
it
pays
off
better
morse
and
others
who
knew
bannerman
personally
tell
me
that
this
conveys
a
hint
of
his
personality
i
am
not
qualified
to
comment
on
the
material
of
this
journal
except
to
say
that
i
have
no
evidence
to
support
or
to
contradict
bannerman
statements
the
journal
has
been
studied
only
by
my
immediate
superiors
by
morse
and
by
myself
i
take
it
for
granted
you
will
hold
the
matter
in
strictest
confidence
with
the
journal
i
am
also
enclosing
a
statement
by
morse
written
at
my
request
for
our
records
and
for
your
information
you
will
note
that
he
says
with
some
qualifications
that
death
was
not
inconsistent
with
an
embolism
he
has
signed
a
death
certificate
on
that
basis
you
will
recall
from
my
letter
of
august
that
it
was
morse
who
discovered
bannerman
body
because
he
was
a
close
personal
friend
of
the
deceased
morse
did
not
feel
able
to
perform
the
autopsy
himself
it
was
done
by
a
stephen
clyde
of
this
city
and
was
virtually
negative
as
regards
cause
of
death
neither
confirming
nor
contradicting
morse
original
tentative
diagnosis
if
you
wish
to
read
the
autopsy
report
in
full
i
shall
be
glad
to
forward
a
copy
morse
tells
me
that
so
far
as
he
knows
bannerman
had
no
near
relatives
he
never
married
for
the
last
twelve
summers
he
occupied
a
small
cottage
on
a
back
road
about
miles
from
this
city
and
had
few
visitors
the
neighbor
steele
mentioned
in
the
journal
is
a
farmer
age
of
good
character
who
tells
me
he
never
got
really
acquainted
with
dr
bannerman
at
this
office
we
feel
that
unless
new
information
comes
to
light
further
active
investigation
is
hardly
justified

extract
from

june
it
must
have
been
at
least
three
weeks
ago
when
we
had
that
flying
saucer
flurry
observers
the
other
side
of
katahdin
saw
it
come
down
this
side
observers
this
side
saw
it
come
down
the
other
size
anywhere
from
six
inches
to
sixty
feet
in
diameter
or
was
it
and
speed
whatever
you
please
seem
to
recall
that
witnesses
agreed
on
a
light
there
was
the
inevitable
gobbledegookery
of
official
explanation
designed
to
leave
everyone
impressed
soothed
and
disappointed
i
paid
scant
attention
to
the
excitement
and
less
to
the
explanations
naturally
i
thought
it
was
just
a
flying
saucer
but
now
camilla
has
hatched
out
an
angel
i
have
eight
hens
all
yearlings
except
camilla
this
is
her
third
spring
i
boarded
her
two
winters
at
my
neighbor
steele
farm
when
i
closed
this
shack
and
shuffled
my
chilly
bones
off
to
florida
because
even
as
a
pullet
she
had
a
manner
which
overbore
me
i
could
never
have
eaten
camilla
if
she
had
looked
at
the
ax
with
that
same
expression
of
rancid
disapproval
and
she
would
i
should
have
felt
i
was
beheading
a
favorite
aunt
her
only
concession
to
sentiment
is
the
annual
rush
of
maternity
to
the
brain
normal
for
a
white
plymouth
rock
this
year
she
stole
a
nest
successfully
in
a
tangle
of
blackberry
by
the
time
i
located
it
i
estimated
i
was
about
two
weeks
too
late
i
had
to
outwit
her
by
watching
from
a
window
she
is
far
too
acute
to
be
openly
trailed
from
feeding
ground
to
nest
when
i
had
bled
and
pruned
my
way
to
her
hideout
she
was
sitting
on
nine
eggs
and
hating
my
guts
they
could
not
be
fertile
since
i
keep
no
rooster
and
i
was
about
to
rob
her
when
i
saw
the
ninth
egg
was
not
hers
nor
any
other
chicken
it
was
a
deep
blue
transparent
with
flecks
of
inner
light
that
made
me
think
of
the
first
stars
in
a
clear
evening
it
was
the
same
size
as
camilla
eggs
there
was
an
embryo
but
nothing
i
could
recognize
i
returned
the
egg
to
camilla
bare
and
fevered
breastbone
and
went
back
to
the
house
for
a
long
cool
drink
that
was
ten
days
ago
i
know
i
ought
to
have
kept
a
record
i
examined
the
blue
egg
every
day
watching
how
some
nameless
life
grew
within
it
until
finally
the
angel
chipped
the
shell
deftly
in
two
parts
this
was
evidently
done
with
the
aid
of
small
horny
on
her
elbows
these
growths
were
sloughed
off
on
the
second
day
i
wish
i
had
seen
her
break
the
shell
but
when
i
visited
the
blackberry
tangle
three
days
ago
she
was
already
out
she
poked
her
exquisite
head
through
camilla
neck
feather
smiled
sleepily
and
snuggled
back
into
darkness
to
finish
drying
off
so
what
could
i
do
more
than
save
the
broken
shell
and
wriggle
my
clumsy
self
out
of
there
i
had
removed
camilla
own
eggs
the
day
before
camilla
was
only
moderately
annoyed
i
was
nervous
about
disposing
of
them
even
though
they
were
obviously
camilla
but
no
harm
was
done
i
cracked
each
one
to
be
sure
very
frankly
rotten
eggs
and
nothing
more
in
the
evening
of
that
day
i
thought
of
rats
and
weasels
as
i
should
have
earlier
i
hastily
prepared
a
box
in
the
kitchen
and
brought
the
two
in
the
angel
quiet
in
my
closed
hand
they
are
there
now
i
think
they
are
comfortable
three
days
after
hatching
the
angel
is
the
length
of
my
say
three
inches
tall
with
about
the
relative
proportions
of
a
girl
except
for
head
hands
and
probably
the
soles
of
her
feet
she
is
clothed
in
feathery
down
the
color
of
ivory
what
can
be
seen
of
her
skin
is
a
glowing
pink
i
do
mean
glowing
like
the
inside
of
certain
seashells
just
above
the
small
of
her
back
are
two
stubs
which
i
take
to
be
infantile
wings
they
do
not
suggest
an
extra
pair
of
specialized
forelimbs
i
think
they
are
wholly
differentiated
organs
perhaps
they
will
be
like
the
wings
of
an
insect
somehow
i
never
thought
of
angels
buzzing
maybe
she
wo
i
know
very
little
about
angels
at
present
the
stubs
are
covered
with
some
dull
tissue
no
doubt
a
protective
sheath
to
be
discarded
when
the
membranes
if
they
are
membranes
are
ready
to
grow
between
the
stubs
is
a
not
very
prominent
ridge
special
musculature
i
suppose
otherwise
her
shape
is
quite
human
even
to
a
pair
of
minuscule
mammalian
just
visible
under
the
down
how
that
can
make
sense
in
an
organism
is
beyond
my
comprehension
just
for
the
record
so
is
a
corot
landscape
so
is
schubert
unfinished
so
is
the
flight
of
a
hummingbird
or
the
of
frost
on
a
windowpane
the
down
on
her
head
has
grown
visibly
in
three
days
and
is
of
different
quality
from
the
body
down
later
it
may
resemble
human
hair
probably
as
a
diamond
resembles
a
chunk
of
granite
a
curious
thing
has
happened
i
went
to
camilla
box
after
writing
that
judy
was
already
lying
in
front
of
it
unexcited
the
head
was
out
from
under
the
feathers
and
i
thought
with
more
verbal
distinctness
than
such
thoughts
commonly
take
here
i
am
a
naturalist
of
middle
years
and
cold
sober
observing
a
oviparous
mammal
with
down
and
footnote
bannerman
dog
mentioned
often
earlier
in
the
journal
a
english
setter
according
to
an
entry
of
may
she
was
then
beginning
to
go
blind
blaine
the
thing
is
she
giggled
now
it
might
have
been
only
amusement
at
my
appearance
which
to
her
must
be
enormously
gross
and
comic
but
another
thought
formed
unspoken
am
no
longer
and
her
face
hardly
bigger
than
a
dime
immediately
changed
from
laughter
to
a
brooding
and
friendly
thoughtfulness
judy
and
camilla
are
old
friends
judy
seems
untroubled
by
the
angel
i
have
no
worries
about
leaving
them
alone
together
june
i
made
no
entry
last
night
the
angel
was
talking
to
me
and
when
that
was
finished
i
drowsed
off
immediately
on
a
cot
which
i
have
moved
into
the
kitchen
to
be
near
them
i
had
never
been
strongly
impressed
by
the
evidence
for
extrasensory
perception
it
is
fortunate
that
my
mind
was
able
to
accept
the
novelty
since
to
the
angel
it
is
clearly
a
matter
of
course
her
tiny
mouth
is
most
expressive
but
moves
only
for
that
reason
and
for
eating
not
for
speech
probably
she
could
speak
to
her
own
kind
if
she
wished
but
i
dare
say
the
sound
would
be
above
the
range
of
my
hearing
as
well
as
my
understanding
last
night
after
i
brought
the
cot
in
and
was
about
to
finish
my
puttering
bachelor
supper
she
climbed
to
the
edge
of
the
box
and
pointed
first
at
herself
and
then
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
table
afraid
to
let
my
vast
hand
take
hold
of
her
i
held
it
out
flat
and
she
sat
in
my
palm
camilla
was
inclined
to
fuss
but
the
angel
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
camilla
subsided
watchful
but
no
longer
alarmed
the
is
porcelain
and
the
angel
shivered
i
folded
a
towel
and
spread
a
silk
handkerchief
on
top
of
that
the
angel
sat
on
this
arrangement
with
apparent
comfort
near
my
face
i
was
not
even
bewildered
without
realizing
why
that
does
seem
possible
does
it
but
there
was
a
good
reason
she
reached
me
first
with
visual
imagery
how
can
i
make
it
plain
that
this
had
nothing
in
common
with
my
sleeping
dreams
there
was
no
weight
of
symbolism
from
my
littered
past
no
discoverable
connection
with
any
of
yesterday
commonplaces
indeed
no
actual
involvement
of
my
personality
at
all
i
saw
i
was
moving
vision
though
without
eyes
or
other
flesh
and
while
my
mind
saw
it
also
knew
where
my
flesh
was
seated
at
the
kitchen
table
if
anyone
had
entered
the
kitchen
if
there
had
been
a
noise
of
alarm
out
in
the
henhouse
i
should
have
known
it
there
was
a
valley
such
as
i
have
not
seen
and
never
will
on
earth
i
have
seen
many
beautiful
places
on
this
planet
some
of
them
were
even
tranquil
once
i
took
a
slow
steamer
to
new
zealand
and
had
the
pacific
as
a
for
many
days
i
can
hardly
say
how
i
knew
this
was
not
earth
the
grass
of
the
valley
was
a
familiar
green
a
river
below
me
was
a
blue
and
silver
thread
under
sunlight
there
were
trees
much
like
pine
and
maple
and
maybe
that
is
what
they
were
but
it
was
not
earth
i
was
aware
of
mountains
heaped
to
strange
heights
on
either
side
of
the
valley
snow
rose
amber
gold
the
amber
tint
was
unlike
any
mountain
color
i
have
noticed
in
this
world
at
or
i
may
have
known
it
was
not
earth
simply
because
her
mind
dwelling
within
some
unimaginable
brain
smaller
than
the
tip
of
my
little
finger
told
me
so
i
watched
two
inhabitants
of
that
world
come
flying
to
rest
in
the
field
of
sunny
grass
where
my
bodiless
vision
had
brought
me
adult
forms
such
as
my
angel
would
surely
be
when
she
had
her
growth
except
that
both
of
these
were
male
and
one
of
them
was
the
latter
was
also
old
with
a
face
knowing
and
full
of
tranquillity
the
other
was
flushed
and
lively
with
youth
both
were
beautiful
the
down
of
the
old
one
was
the
other
was
ivory
with
hints
of
orange
their
wings
were
true
membranes
with
more
variety
of
subtle
iridescence
than
i
have
seen
even
in
the
wings
of
a
dragonfly
i
could
not
say
that
any
color
was
dominant
for
each
motion
brought
a
ripple
of
change
these
two
sat
at
their
ease
on
the
grass
i
realized
that
they
were
talking
to
each
other
though
their
lips
did
not
move
in
speech
more
than
once
or
twice
they
would
nod
smile
now
and
then
illustrate
something
with
twinkling
hands
a
huge
rabbit
lolloped
past
them
i
knew
thanks
to
my
own
efforts
i
supposed
that
this
animal
was
of
the
same
size
as
our
common
wild
ones
later
a
snake
three
times
the
size
of
the
angels
came
flowing
through
the
grass
the
old
one
reached
out
to
stroke
its
head
carelessly
and
i
think
he
did
it
without
interrupting
whatever
he
was
saying
another
creature
came
in
leisured
leaps
he
was
monstrous
yet
i
felt
no
alarm
in
the
angels
or
myself
imagine
a
being
built
somewhat
like
a
kangaroo
up
to
the
head
about
eight
feet
tall
and
really
the
thick
balancing
tail
and
enormous
legs
were
the
only
kangaroolike
features
about
him
the
body
above
the
massive
thighs
was
not
dwarfed
but
thick
and
square
the
arms
and
hands
were
quite
humanoid
and
the
head
was
round
manlike
except
for
its
face
there
was
only
a
single
nostril
and
his
mouth
was
set
in
the
vertical
the
eyes
were
large
and
mild
i
received
an
impression
of
high
intelligence
and
natural
gentleness
in
one
of
his
manlike
hands
he
carried
two
tools
so
familiar
and
ordinary
that
i
knew
my
body
by
the
kitchen
table
had
laughed
in
startled
recognition
but
after
all
a
garden
spade
and
rake
are
basic
once
invented
i
expect
we
did
it
ourselves
in
the
neolithic
there
is
little
reason
why
they
should
change
much
down
the
millennia
this
farmer
halted
by
the
angels
and
the
three
conversed
a
while
the
big
head
nodded
agreeably
i
believe
the
young
angel
made
a
joke
certainly
the
convulsions
in
the
huge
green
face
made
me
think
of
laughter
then
this
amiable
monster
turned
up
the
grass
in
a
patch
a
few
yards
square
broke
the
sod
and
raked
the
surface
smooth
just
as
any
competent
gardener
might
do
except
that
he
moved
with
the
relaxed
smoothness
of
a
being
whose
strength
far
exceeds
the
requirements
of
his
task
i
was
back
in
my
kitchen
with
everyday
eyes
my
angel
was
exploring
the
table
i
had
a
loaf
of
bread
there
and
a
dish
of
strawberries
in
cream
she
was
trying
a
breadcrumb
seemed
to
like
it
fairly
well
i
offered
the
strawberries
she
broke
off
one
of
the
seeds
and
nibbled
it
but
did
care
so
much
for
the
pulp
i
held
up
the
great
spoon
with
sugary
cream
she
steadied
it
with
both
hands
to
try
some
i
think
she
liked
it
it
had
been
stupid
of
me
not
to
realize
that
she
would
be
hungry
i
brought
wine
from
the
cupboard
she
watched
inquiringly
so
i
put
a
couple
of
drops
on
the
handle
of
a
spoon
the
taste
really
pleased
her
she
chuckled
and
patted
her
tiny
stomach
though
i
afraid
it
very
good
sherry
i
brought
some
crumbs
of
cake
but
she
indicated
that
she
was
full
came
close
to
my
face
and
motioned
me
to
lower
my
head
she
reached
up
until
she
could
press
both
hands
against
my
forehead
i
felt
it
only
enough
to
know
her
hands
were
there
and
she
stood
so
a
long
time
trying
to
tell
me
something
it
was
difficult
pictures
come
through
with
relative
ease
but
now
she
was
transmitting
an
abstraction
of
a
complex
kind
my
clumsy
brain
suffered
in
the
effort
to
receive
something
did
come
across
but
i
have
only
the
crudest
way
of
passing
it
on
imagine
an
equilateral
triangle
place
the
following
words
one
at
each
corner
recruiting
collecting
saving
the
meaning
she
wanted
to
convey
ought
to
be
near
the
center
of
the
triangle
i
had
also
the
sense
that
her
message
provided
a
partial
explanation
of
her
errand
in
this
lovable
and
damnable
world
she
looked
weary
when
she
stood
away
from
me
i
put
out
my
palm
and
she
climbed
into
it
to
be
carried
back
to
the
nest
she
did
not
talk
to
me
tonight
nor
eat
but
she
gave
a
reason
coming
out
from
camilla
feathers
long
enough
to
turn
her
back
and
show
me
the
the
protective
sheaths
have
dropped
off
the
wings
are
rapidly
growing
they
are
probably
damp
and
weak
she
was
quite
tired
and
went
back
into
the
warm
darkness
almost
at
once
camilla
must
be
exhausted
too
i
do
think
she
has
been
off
the
nest
more
than
twice
since
i
brought
them
into
the
house
june
today
she
can
fly
i
learned
it
in
the
afternoon
when
i
was
fiddling
about
in
the
garden
and
judy
was
loafing
in
the
sunshine
she
loves
something
apart
from
sight
and
sound
called
me
to
hurry
back
to
the
house
i
saw
my
angel
through
the
screen
door
before
i
opened
it
one
of
her
feet
had
caught
in
a
hideous
loop
of
loose
wire
at
a
break
in
the
mesh
her
first
tug
of
alarm
must
have
tightened
the
loop
so
that
her
hands
were
not
strong
enough
to
force
it
open
fortunately
i
was
able
to
cut
the
wire
with
a
pair
of
shears
before
i
lost
my
head
then
she
could
free
her
foot
without
injury
camilla
had
been
frantic
rushing
around
fluffed
up
but
here
an
odd
thing
perfectly
silent
none
of
the
recognized
of
dismay
if
an
ordinary
chick
had
been
in
trouble
she
would
have
raised
the
roof
the
angel
flew
to
me
and
hovered
pressing
her
hands
on
my
forehead
the
message
was
clear
at
once
no
harm
done
she
flew
down
to
tell
camilla
the
same
thing
yes
in
the
same
way
i
saw
camilla
standing
near
my
feet
with
her
neck
out
and
head
low
and
the
angel
put
a
hand
on
either
side
of
her
scraggy
comb
camilla
relaxed
clucked
in
the
normal
way
and
spread
her
wings
for
a
shelter
the
angel
went
under
it
but
only
to
oblige
camilla
i
think
at
least
she
stuck
her
head
through
the
wing
feathers
and
winked
she
must
have
seen
something
else
then
for
she
came
out
and
flew
back
to
me
and
touched
a
finger
to
my
cheek
looked
at
the
finger
saw
it
was
wet
put
it
in
her
mouth
made
a
face
and
laughed
at
me
we
went
outdoors
into
the
sun
camilla
too
and
the
angel
gave
me
an
exhibition
of
what
flying
ought
to
be
not
even
wagner
can
speak
of
joy
as
her
first
free
flying
did
at
one
moment
she
would
be
hanging
in
front
of
my
eyes
radiant
and
delighted
the
next
instant
she
would
be
a
dot
of
color
against
a
cloud
try
to
imagine
something
that
would
make
a
hummingbird
seem
dull
and
sluggish
they
do
hum
softer
than
a
hummingbird
louder
than
a
dragonfly
something
like
the
sound
of
for
instance
the
one
i
used
to
call
hummingbird
moth
when
i
was
a
child
i
was
frightened
naturally
frightened
first
at
what
might
happen
to
her
but
that
was
unnecessary
i
do
think
she
would
be
in
danger
from
any
savage
animal
except
possibly
man
i
saw
a
cooper
hawk
slant
down
the
invisible
toward
the
swirl
of
color
where
she
was
dancing
by
herself
presently
she
was
drawing
iridescent
rings
around
him
then
while
he
soared
in
smaller
circles
i
could
not
see
her
but
maybe
she
felt
my
fright
she
was
again
in
front
of
me
pressing
my
forehead
in
the
now
familiar
way
i
knew
she
was
amused
and
caught
the
idea
that
the
hawk
was
a
lazy
character
not
quite
the
way
i
describe
but
it
all
in
the
point
of
view
i
believe
she
had
been
riding
his
back
no
doubt
with
her
telepathic
hands
on
his
predatory
head
later
i
was
frightened
by
the
thought
that
she
might
not
want
to
return
to
me
could
i
compete
with
sunlight
and
open
sky
the
passage
of
that
terror
through
me
brought
her
swiftly
back
and
her
hands
said
with
great
clarity
do
ever
be
afraid
of
anything
it
is
necessary
for
you
once
this
afternoon
i
was
saddened
by
the
realization
that
old
judy
can
take
little
part
in
what
goes
on
now
i
can
well
remember
judy
running
like
the
wind
the
angel
must
have
heard
this
thought
in
me
for
she
stood
a
long
time
beside
judy
drowsy
head
while
judy
tail
thumped
cheerfully
on
the
warm
grass
in
the
evening
the
angel
made
a
heavy
meal
on
two
or
three
cake
crumbs
and
another
drop
of
sherry
and
we
had
what
was
almost
a
sustained
conversation
i
will
write
it
in
that
form
this
time
rather
than
grope
for
anything
more
exact
i
asked
her
how
far
away
is
your
home
my
home
is
here
i
meant
the
place
your
people
came
from
ten
light
years
the
images
you
showed
me
that
quiet
valley
that
is
ten
light
years
away
yes
but
that
was
my
father
talking
to
you
through
me
he
was
grown
when
the
journey
began
he
is
two
hundred
and
forty
years
old
our
years
days
longer
than
each
of
yours
mainly
i
was
conscious
of
a
flood
of
relief
i
had
feared
on
the
basis
of
terrestrial
biology
that
her
explosively
rapid
growth
after
hatching
must
foretell
a
brief
life
but
it
all
right
she
can
outlive
me
and
by
a
few
hundred
years
at
that
your
father
is
here
now
on
this
planet
shall
i
see
him
she
took
her
hands
away
listening
i
believe
the
answer
was
no
he
is
sorry
he
is
ill
and
can
not
live
long
i
am
to
see
him
in
a
few
days
when
i
fly
a
little
better
he
taught
me
for
twenty
years
after
i
was
born
i
do
understand
i
thought
that
later
friend
my
father
is
grateful
for
your
kindness
to
me
i
do
know
what
i
thought
about
that
i
felt
no
faintest
trace
of
condescension
in
the
message
and
he
was
showing
me
things
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
ten
light
years
away
yes
then
she
wanted
me
to
rest
a
while
i
am
sure
she
knows
what
a
huge
effort
it
is
for
my
primitive
brain
to
function
in
this
way
but
before
she
ended
the
conversation
by
humming
down
to
her
nest
she
gave
me
this
and
i
received
it
with
such
clarity
that
i
can
not
be
mistaken
he
says
that
only
fifty
million
years
ago
it
was
a
jungle
there
just
as
terra
is
now
june
when
i
woke
four
days
ago
the
angel
was
having
breakfast
and
little
camilla
was
dead
the
angel
watched
me
rub
sleep
out
of
my
eyes
watched
me
discover
camilla
and
then
flew
to
me
i
received
this
does
it
make
you
unhappy
i
do
know
exactly
you
can
get
fond
of
a
hen
especially
a
cantankerous
and
homely
old
one
whose
personality
has
a
lot
in
common
with
your
own
she
was
old
she
wanted
a
flock
of
chicks
and
i
could
stay
with
her
so
i
something
obscure
here
probably
my
mind
was
trying
too
hard
to
grasp
it
so
i
saved
her
life
i
could
make
nothing
else
out
of
it
she
said
saved
camilla
death
looked
natural
except
that
i
should
have
expected
the
death
contractions
to
muss
the
straw
and
that
had
happened
maybe
the
angel
had
arranged
the
old
lady
body
for
decorum
though
i
see
how
her
muscular
strength
would
have
been
equal
to
it
camilla
weighed
at
least
seven
pounds
as
i
was
burying
her
at
the
edge
of
the
garden
and
the
angel
was
humming
over
my
head
i
recalled
a
thing
which
when
it
happened
i
had
dismissed
as
a
dream
merely
a
moonlight
image
of
the
angel
standing
in
the
nest
box
with
her
hands
on
camilla
head
then
pressing
her
mouth
gently
on
camilla
throat
just
before
the
hen
head
sank
down
out
of
my
line
of
vision
probably
i
actually
awoke
and
saw
it
happen
i
am
somehow
unconcerned
even
as
i
think
more
about
it
pleased
after
the
burial
the
angel
hands
said
sit
on
the
grass
and
talk
question
me
i
tell
you
what
i
can
my
father
asks
you
to
write
it
down
so
that
is
what
we
have
been
doing
for
the
last
four
days
i
have
been
going
to
school
a
slow
but
willing
pupil
rather
than
enter
anything
in
this
journal
for
in
the
evenings
i
was
exhausted
i
made
notes
as
best
i
could
the
angel
has
gone
now
to
see
her
father
and
will
not
return
until
morning
i
shall
try
to
make
a
readable
version
of
my
notes
since
she
had
invited
questions
i
began
with
something
which
had
been
bothering
me
as
a
naturalist
exceedingly
i
could
see
how
creatures
no
larger
than
the
adults
i
had
observed
could
lay
eggs
as
large
as
camilla
nor
could
i
understand
why
if
they
were
hatched
in
an
almost
adult
condition
and
able
to
eat
a
varied
diet
she
had
any
use
for
that
ridiculous
lovely
and
apparently
functional
pair
of
breasts
when
the
angel
grasped
my
difficulty
she
exploded
with
laughter
her
kind
which
buzzed
her
all
over
the
garden
and
caused
her
to
fluff
my
hair
on
the
wing
and
pinch
my
earlobe
she
lit
on
a
rhubarb
leaf
and
gave
a
delectably
naughty
representation
of
herself
as
a
hen
laying
an
egg
including
the
cackle
she
got
me
to
bumbling
helplessly
my
kind
of
laughter
and
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
quiet
down
then
she
did
her
best
to
explain
they
are
true
mammals
and
the
young
not
more
than
two
or
at
most
three
in
a
lifetime
averaging
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
are
delivered
in
very
much
the
human
way
the
baby
is
nursed
human
fashion
until
his
brain
begins
to
respond
a
little
to
their
unspoken
language
that
takes
three
to
four
weeks
then
he
is
placed
in
an
altogether
different
medium
she
could
not
describe
that
clearly
because
there
was
very
little
in
my
educational
storehouse
to
help
me
grasp
it
it
is
some
gaseous
medium
which
arrests
bodily
growth
for
an
almost
indefinite
period
while
mental
growth
continues
it
took
them
she
says
about
seven
thousand
years
to
perfect
this
technique
after
they
first
hit
on
the
idea
they
are
never
in
a
hurry
the
infant
remains
under
this
delicate
and
precise
control
for
anywhere
from
fifteen
to
thirty
years
the
period
depending
not
only
on
his
mental
vigor
but
also
on
the
type
of
lifework
he
tentatively
elects
as
soon
as
his
brain
is
knowing
enough
to
make
a
choice
during
this
period
his
mind
is
guided
with
patience
by
teachers
who
it
seems
those
teachers
know
their
business
this
was
peculiarly
difficult
for
me
to
assimilate
although
the
facts
came
through
clearly
enough
in
their
world
the
profession
of
teacher
is
more
highly
honored
than
any
other
can
such
a
thing
be
possible
and
so
difficult
to
enter
that
only
the
strongest
minds
dare
to
attempt
it
i
had
to
rest
a
while
after
absorbing
that
an
aspirant
must
spend
fifty
years
not
including
the
period
of
infantile
education
merely
getting
ready
to
begin
and
the
acquisition
of
factual
knowledge
while
not
understressed
takes
only
a
small
proportion
of
those
fifty
years
then
if
he
good
enough
he
can
take
a
small
part
in
the
elementary
instruction
of
a
few
babies
and
if
he
does
well
on
that
basis
for
another
thirty
or
forty
years
he
is
considered
a
fair
beginner
once
upon
a
time
i
myself
lurched
around
stuffy
classrooms
trying
to
insert
a
few
predigested
facts
i
wonder
how
many
of
them
facts
into
the
minds
of
bored
and
preoccupied
adolescents
some
of
whom
may
have
liked
me
moderately
well
i
was
even
able
to
shake
hands
and
be
nice
while
their
terribly
parents
explained
to
me
how
they
ought
to
be
educated
so
much
of
our
human
effort
goes
down
the
drain
of
futility
i
sometimes
wonder
how
we
ever
got
as
far
as
the
bronze
age
somehow
we
did
though
and
a
short
way
beyond
after
that
preliminary
stage
of
an
angel
education
is
finished
the
baby
is
transferred
to
more
ordinary
surroundings
and
his
bodily
growth
completes
itself
in
a
very
short
time
wings
grow
abruptly
as
i
have
seen
and
he
reaches
a
maximum
height
of
six
inches
by
our
measure
only
then
does
he
enter
on
that
lifetime
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
for
not
until
then
does
his
body
begin
to
age
my
angel
has
been
a
living
personality
for
many
years
but
will
not
celebrate
her
first
birthday
for
almost
a
year
i
like
to
think
of
that
at
about
the
same
time
that
they
learned
the
principles
of
interplanetary
travel
approximately
twelve
million
years
ago
these
people
also
learned
how
growth
could
be
rearrested
at
any
point
short
of
full
maturity
at
first
the
knowledge
served
no
purpose
except
in
the
control
of
illnesses
which
still
occasionally
struck
them
at
that
time
but
when
the
long
periods
of
time
required
for
space
travel
were
considered
the
advantages
became
obvious
so
it
happens
that
my
angel
was
born
ten
light
years
away
she
was
trained
by
her
father
and
many
others
in
the
wisdom
of
seventy
million
years
that
she
tells
me
is
the
approximate
sum
of
their
history
and
then
she
was
safely
sealed
and
cherished
in
what
my
superamebic
brain
regarded
as
a
blue
egg
education
did
not
proceed
at
that
time
her
mind
went
to
sleep
with
the
rest
of
her
when
warmth
made
her
wake
and
grow
again
she
remembered
what
to
do
with
the
little
horny
bumps
provided
for
her
elbows
and
came
out
into
this
planet
god
help
her
i
wondered
why
her
father
should
have
chosen
any
combination
so
unreliable
as
an
old
hen
and
a
human
being
surely
he
must
have
had
plenty
of
excellent
ways
to
bring
the
shell
to
the
right
temperature
her
answer
should
have
satisfied
me
immensely
but
i
am
still
compelled
to
wonder
about
it
camilla
was
a
nice
hen
and
my
father
studied
your
mind
while
you
were
asleep
it
was
a
bad
landing
and
much
was
broken
no
such
landing
was
ever
made
before
after
so
long
a
journey
only
four
other
could
come
with
my
father
three
of
them
died
en
route
and
he
is
very
and
there
were
nine
other
children
to
care
for
yes
i
knew
she
said
that
an
angel
thought
i
was
good
enough
to
be
trusted
with
his
daughter
if
it
upsets
me
all
i
need
do
is
look
at
her
and
then
in
the
mirror
as
for
the
explanation
i
can
only
conclude
there
must
be
more
which
i
am
not
ready
to
understand
i
was
worried
about
those
nine
others
but
she
assured
me
they
were
all
well
and
i
sensed
that
i
ought
not
to
ask
more
about
them
at
present
their
planet
she
says
is
closely
similar
to
this
a
trifle
larger
moving
in
a
somewhat
longer
orbit
around
a
sun
like
ours
two
gleaming
moons
smaller
than
ours
their
orbits
are
such
that
nights
come
rarely
they
are
magic
and
she
will
ask
her
father
to
show
me
one
if
he
can
because
of
a
slower
rotation
their
day
has
of
our
hours
their
atmosphere
is
mainly
nitrogen
and
oxygen
in
the
proportion
familiar
to
us
slightly
richer
in
some
of
the
rare
gases
the
climate
is
now
what
we
should
call
tropical
and
subtropical
but
they
have
known
glacial
rigors
like
those
in
our
world
past
there
are
only
two
great
continental
land
masses
and
many
thousands
of
large
islands
their
total
population
is
only
five
billion
it
seems
my
angel
wants
to
become
a
student
of
animal
life
here
on
earth
i
her
teacher
but
bless
her
for
the
notion
anyhow
we
sat
and
traded
animals
for
a
couple
of
hours
last
night
i
found
it
restful
after
the
mental
struggle
to
grasp
more
difficult
matters
judy
was
something
new
to
her
they
have
several
luscious
monsters
on
that
planet
but
in
her
view
so
have
we
she
told
me
of
a
blue
fifty
feet
long
relatively
harmless
that
bellows
cowlike
and
comes
into
the
tidal
marshes
to
lay
black
eggs
so
i
gave
her
a
whale
she
offered
a
ball
of
mammalian
fluff
as
big
as
my
head
and
weighing
under
an
ounce
i
matched
her
with
a
marmoset
she
tried
me
with
a
pink
brontosaur
very
rare
but
i
was
ready
with
the
platypus
and
that
caused
us
to
exchange
some
pretty
funny
remarks
about
mammalian
eggs
all
trivial
in
a
way
also
the
happiest
evening
in
my
tangled
years
of
life
she
was
a
trifle
hesitant
to
explain
those
kangaroolike
people
until
she
was
sure
i
really
wanted
to
know
it
seems
they
are
about
the
nearest
parallel
to
human
life
on
that
planet
not
a
near
parallel
of
course
as
she
was
careful
to
explain
agreeable
and
always
friendly
souls
though
they
were
always
so
i
sure
and
of
a
somewhat
more
alert
intelligence
than
we
possess
manual
workers
mainly
because
they
prefer
it
nowadays
but
some
of
them
are
excellent
mathematicians
the
first
practical
spaceship
was
built
by
a
group
of
them
with
assistance
of
course
names
offer
a
difficulty
because
of
the
nature
of
the
angelic
language
they
have
scant
use
for
them
except
for
the
purpose
of
written
record
and
writing
naturally
plays
little
part
in
their
daily
life
no
occasion
to
write
a
letter
when
distance
is
no
obstacle
to
the
speech
of
your
mind
an
angel
formal
name
is
about
as
important
to
him
as
say
my
social
security
number
is
to
me
she
has
not
told
me
hers
because
my
mind
ca
grasp
the
phonetics
on
which
their
written
language
is
based
as
we
would
speak
a
name
an
angel
will
project
the
friend
image
to
his
receiving
mind
more
pleasant
and
more
intimate
i
think
although
it
was
a
shock
to
me
at
first
to
glimpse
my
own
ugly
mug
in
my
mind
eye
stories
are
occasionally
written
if
there
is
something
in
them
that
should
be
preserved
precisely
as
it
was
in
the
first
telling
but
in
their
world
the
true
has
a
more
important
place
than
the
printer
he
offers
one
of
the
best
of
their
quieter
pleasures
a
good
one
can
hold
his
audience
for
a
week
and
never
tire
them
what
is
this
in
your
mind
when
you
think
of
me
she
asked
once
a
being
men
have
imagined
for
centuries
when
they
thought
of
themselves
as
they
might
like
to
be
and
not
as
they
are
i
did
not
try
too
painfully
hard
to
learn
much
about
the
principles
of
space
travel
the
most
my
brain
could
take
in
of
her
explanation
was
something
like
rocket
then
phototropism
now
that
makes
scant
sense
so
far
as
i
know
phototropism
movement
toward
light
is
an
phenomenon
one
thinks
of
it
as
a
response
of
protoplasm
in
some
plants
and
animal
organisms
most
of
them
simple
to
the
stimulus
of
light
certainly
not
as
a
force
capable
of
moving
inorganic
matter
i
think
that
whatever
may
be
the
principle
she
was
describing
this
word
phototropism
was
merely
the
nearest
thing
to
it
in
my
reservoir
of
language
if
i
did
know
the
physical
principles
which
brought
them
here
and
could
write
them
in
terms
accessible
to
technicians
i
would
not
do
it
here
is
a
thing
i
am
afraid
no
hypothetical
reader
of
this
journal
would
believe
these
people
as
i
have
written
learned
their
method
of
space
travel
some
twelve
million
years
ago
yet
this
is
the
first
time
they
have
ever
used
it
to
convey
them
to
another
planet
the
heavens
are
rich
in
worlds
she
tells
me
on
many
of
them
there
is
life
often
on
very
primitive
levels
no
external
force
prevented
her
people
from
going
forth
colonizing
conquering
as
far
as
they
pleased
they
could
have
populated
a
whole
galaxy
they
did
not
because
they
believed
they
were
not
ready
more
precisely
good
enough
only
fifty
million
years
ago
by
her
account
did
they
learn
as
we
may
learn
eventually
that
intelligence
without
goodness
is
worse
than
high
explosive
in
the
hands
of
a
baboon
for
beings
advanced
beyond
the
level
of
pithecanthropus
intelligence
is
a
cheap
commodity
not
too
hard
to
develop
hellishly
easy
to
use
for
unconsidered
ends
whereas
goodness
is
not
to
be
achieved
without
unending
effort
of
the
hardest
kind
within
the
self
whether
the
self
be
man
or
angel
it
is
clear
even
to
me
that
the
conquest
of
evil
is
only
one
step
not
the
most
important
goodness
she
tried
to
tell
me
is
an
altogether
positive
quality
the
part
of
living
nature
that
swarms
with
such
monstrosities
as
cruelty
meanness
bitterness
greed
is
not
to
be
filled
by
a
vacuum
when
these
horrors
are
eliminated
kindness
for
only
one
example
anybody
who
defines
kindness
only
as
the
absence
of
cruelty
does
understand
the
nature
of
either
they
do
not
aim
at
perfection
these
angels
only
at
the
attainable
they
passed
through
many
millenia
while
advances
in
technology
merely
worsened
their
condition
and
increased
the
peril
of
they
came
through
that
in
time
war
was
at
length
so
far
outgrown
that
its
recurrence
was
impossible
and
the
development
of
wholly
rational
beings
could
begin
then
they
were
ready
to
start
growing
up
through
more
millenia
of
seeking
to
earn
the
simple
out
of
the
complex
discovering
how
to
use
knowledge
and
not
be
used
by
it
even
then
of
course
they
slipped
back
often
enough
there
were
what
she
refers
to
as
eras
of
fatigue
in
their
dimmer
past
they
had
had
many
dark
ages
lost
civilizations
hopeful
beginnings
ending
in
dust
earlier
still
they
had
come
out
of
the
slime
as
we
did
but
their
period
of
deepest
uncertainty
and
sternest
did
not
come
until
twelve
million
years
ago
when
they
knew
a
universe
could
be
theirs
for
the
taking
and
knew
they
were
not
yet
good
enough
they
are
in
no
more
hurry
than
the
stars
she
tried
to
convey
something
tentatively
at
this
point
which
was
really
beyond
both
of
us
it
had
to
do
with
time
not
as
i
understand
time
being
perhaps
the
most
essential
attribute
of
god
not
as
i
was
ever
able
to
understand
that
word
seeing
my
mental
exhaustion
she
gave
up
the
effort
and
later
told
me
that
the
conception
was
extremely
difficult
for
her
too
not
only
i
gathered
because
of
her
youth
and
relative
ignorance
there
was
also
a
hint
that
her
father
might
not
have
wished
her
to
bring
my
brain
up
to
a
hurdle
like
that
one
of
course
they
explored
their
little
spaceships
were
roaming
the
ether
before
there
was
anything
like
man
on
earth
roaming
and
listening
observing
recording
never
entering
nor
taking
part
in
the
life
of
any
home
but
their
own
for
five
million
years
they
even
forbade
themselves
to
go
beyond
their
own
solar
system
though
it
would
have
been
easy
to
do
so
and
in
the
following
seven
million
years
although
they
traveled
to
incredible
distances
the
same
stern
restraint
was
held
in
force
it
was
altogether
unrelated
to
what
we
should
call
fear
that
i
think
is
as
extinct
in
them
as
hate
there
was
so
much
to
do
at
home
i
wish
i
could
imagine
it
they
mapped
the
heavens
and
played
in
their
own
sunlight
naturally
i
can
not
tell
you
what
goodness
is
i
know
only
moderately
well
what
it
seems
to
mean
to
us
human
beings
it
appears
that
the
best
of
us
can
often
with
enormous
difficulty
however
achieve
a
manner
of
life
in
which
goodness
somewhat
overbalances
our
aggressive
hostile
tendencies
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
we
are
in
other
words
a
fraction
alive
the
rest
is
in
the
dark
dante
was
a
bitter
masochist
beethoven
a
frantic
and
miserable
snob
shakespeare
wrote
potboilers
and
christ
said
my
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
but
give
us
fifty
million
years
i
am
no
pessimist
after
all
watched
organisms
on
the
slide
and
listened
to
fourth
night
before
last
i
said
to
the
angel
in
spite
of
everything
you
and
i
are
kindred
she
granted
me
agreement
june
she
was
lying
on
my
pillow
this
morning
so
that
i
could
see
her
when
i
awoke
her
father
has
died
and
she
was
with
him
when
it
happened
there
was
again
that
which
i
could
interpret
only
to
mean
that
his
life
had
been
saved
i
was
still
when
my
mind
asked
what
will
you
do
stay
with
you
if
you
wish
it
for
the
rest
of
your
life
the
last
part
of
the
message
was
clouded
but
i
am
familiar
with
that
now
it
seems
to
mean
there
is
some
further
element
which
eludes
me
i
could
not
be
mistaken
about
the
part
i
did
receive
it
gives
me
amazing
speculations
being
only
i
might
live
another
thirty
or
forty
years
she
was
preoccupied
this
morning
but
whatever
she
felt
about
her
father
death
that
might
be
paralleled
by
sadness
in
a
human
being
was
hidden
from
me
she
did
say
her
father
was
sorry
he
had
not
been
able
to
show
me
a
night
one
adult
then
remains
in
this
world
except
to
say
that
he
is
two
hundred
years
old
and
full
of
knowledge
and
that
he
endured
the
long
journey
without
serious
ill
effects
she
has
told
me
little
about
him
and
there
are
ten
children
including
herself
something
was
sparkling
at
her
throat
when
she
was
aware
of
my
interest
in
it
she
took
it
off
and
i
fetched
a
magnifying
glass
a
necklace
under
the
glass
much
like
our
finest
human
workmanship
if
your
imagination
can
reduce
it
to
the
proper
scale
the
stones
appeared
similar
to
the
jewels
we
know
diamonds
sapphires
rubies
emeralds
the
diamonds
snapping
out
every
color
under
heaven
but
there
were
two
or
three
very
dark
purple
stones
unlike
anything
i
know
not
amethysts
i
am
sure
the
necklace
was
strung
on
something
more
slender
than
cobweb
and
the
design
of
the
joining
clasp
was
too
delicate
for
my
glass
to
help
me
the
necklace
had
been
her
mother
she
told
me
as
she
put
it
back
around
her
throat
i
thought
i
saw
the
same
shy
pride
that
any
human
girl
might
feel
in
displaying
a
new
pretty
she
wanted
to
show
me
other
things
she
had
brought
and
flew
to
the
table
where
she
had
left
a
sort
of
satchel
an
inch
and
a
half
long
quite
a
load
for
her
to
fly
with
but
the
translucent
substance
is
so
light
that
when
she
rested
the
satchel
on
my
finger
i
scarcely
felt
it
she
arranged
a
few
articles
eagerly
for
my
inspection
and
i
put
the
glass
to
work
again
one
was
a
jeweled
comb
she
ran
it
through
the
down
on
her
chest
and
legs
to
show
me
its
use
there
was
a
set
of
tools
too
small
for
the
glass
to
interpret
them
i
learned
later
they
were
a
sewing
kit
a
book
and
some
writing
instrument
much
like
a
metal
pencil
the
book
i
understand
is
a
blank
record
for
her
to
use
as
needed
and
finally
when
i
was
fully
awake
and
dressed
and
we
had
finished
breakfast
she
reached
in
the
bottom
of
the
satchel
for
a
parcel
that
was
heavy
for
her
and
made
me
understand
it
was
a
gift
for
me
my
father
made
it
for
you
but
i
put
in
the
stone
myself
last
night
she
unwrapped
it
a
ring
precisely
the
size
for
my
little
finger
i
broke
down
somewhat
she
understood
that
and
sat
on
my
shoulder
patting
my
earlobe
till
i
had
command
of
myself
i
have
no
idea
what
the
jewel
is
it
shifts
with
the
light
from
purple
to
jade
green
to
amber
the
metal
resembles
platinum
in
appearance
except
for
a
tinge
of
rose
at
certain
angles
of
light
when
i
stare
into
the
stone
i
think
i
see
never
mind
that
now
i
am
not
ready
to
write
it
down
and
perhaps
never
will
be
unless
i
am
sure
we
improved
our
housekeeping
later
in
the
morning
i
showed
her
over
the
house
it
is
much
cape
codder
two
rooms
up
and
two
down
every
corner
interested
her
and
when
she
found
a
shoebox
in
the
bedroom
closet
she
asked
for
it
at
her
direction
i
have
arranged
it
on
a
chest
near
my
bed
and
the
window
which
shall
be
always
open
she
says
the
mosquitoes
will
not
bother
me
and
i
do
doubt
her
i
unearthed
a
white
silk
scarf
for
the
bottom
of
the
box
after
asking
my
permission
as
if
i
could
want
to
refuse
her
anything
she
got
her
sewing
kit
and
snipped
off
a
piece
of
the
scarf
several
inches
square
folded
it
on
itself
several
times
and
sewed
it
into
a
narrow
pillow
an
inch
long
so
now
she
has
a
proper
bed
and
a
room
of
her
own
i
wish
i
had
something
less
coarse
than
silk
but
she
insists
she
pleased
with
it
we
have
not
talked
very
much
today
in
the
afternoon
she
flew
out
for
an
hour
play
in
the
when
she
returned
she
let
me
know
that
she
needed
a
long
sleep
she
is
still
sleeping
i
think
i
am
writing
this
downstairs
fearing
the
light
might
disturb
her
is
it
possible
i
can
have
thirty
or
forty
years
in
her
company
i
wonder
how
teachable
my
mind
still
is
i
seem
to
be
able
to
assimilate
new
facts
as
well
as
i
ever
could
this
ungainly
carcass
should
be
durable
with
reasonable
care
of
course
facts
without
a
synthesizing
imagination
are
no
better
than
scattered
bricks
but
perhaps
my
imagination
i
do
know
judy
wants
out
i
shall
turn
in
when
she
comes
back
i
wonder
if
poor
judy
life
could
be
the
word
is
certainly
saved
i
must
ask
june
last
night
when
i
stopped
writing
i
did
go
to
bed
but
i
was
restless
refusing
sleep
at
some
time
in
the
small
hours
there
was
light
from
a
single
moon
she
flew
over
to
me
the
tensions
dissolved
away
like
an
illness
and
my
mind
was
able
to
respond
with
a
certain
calm
i
made
plain
that
i
would
never
willingly
part
company
with
her
which
i
am
sure
she
already
knew
and
she
gave
me
to
understand
that
there
are
two
alternatives
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
the
choice
she
says
is
altogether
mine
and
i
must
take
time
to
be
sure
of
my
decision
i
can
live
out
my
natural
span
whatever
it
proves
to
be
and
she
will
not
leave
me
for
long
at
any
time
she
will
be
there
to
advise
teach
help
me
in
anything
good
i
care
to
undertake
she
says
she
would
enjoy
this
for
some
reason
she
is
as
we
say
in
our
language
fond
of
me
lord
the
books
i
could
write
i
fumble
for
words
now
in
the
usual
human
way
whatever
i
put
on
paper
is
a
miserable
fraction
of
the
potential
the
words
themselves
are
rarely
the
right
ones
but
under
her
guidance
i
could
take
a
fair
part
in
shaking
the
world
with
words
alone
i
could
preach
to
my
own
people
before
long
i
would
be
heard
i
could
study
and
explore
what
small
nibblings
we
have
made
at
the
sum
of
available
knowledge
suppose
i
brought
in
one
leaf
from
outdoors
or
one
common
little
bug
in
a
few
hours
of
studying
it
with
her
i
know
more
of
my
own
specialty
than
a
flood
of
the
best
textbooks
could
tell
me
she
has
also
let
me
know
that
when
she
and
those
who
came
with
her
have
learned
a
little
more
about
humanity
it
should
be
possible
to
improve
my
health
greatly
and
probably
my
life
expectancy
i
imagine
my
back
could
ever
straighten
but
she
thinks
the
pain
might
be
cleared
away
entirely
without
drugs
i
could
have
a
clearer
mind
in
a
body
that
would
neither
fail
nor
torment
me
then
there
is
the
other
alternative
it
seems
they
have
developed
a
technique
by
means
of
which
any
unresisting
living
subject
whose
brain
is
capable
of
memory
at
all
can
experience
it
is
a
i
understand
of
their
silent
speech
and
a
very
recent
one
they
have
practiced
it
for
only
a
few
thousand
years
and
since
their
own
understanding
of
the
phenomenon
is
very
incomplete
they
classify
it
among
their
experimental
techniques
in
a
general
way
it
may
somewhat
resemble
that
reliving
of
the
past
which
psychoanalysis
can
sometimes
bring
about
in
a
limited
way
for
therapeutic
purposes
but
you
must
imagine
that
sort
of
thing
tremendously
magnified
and
clarified
capable
of
including
every
detail
which
has
ever
registered
on
the
subject
brain
the
purpose
is
not
therapeutic
as
we
would
understand
it
quite
the
opposite
the
end
result
is
death
whatever
is
recalled
by
this
process
is
transmitted
to
the
receiving
mind
which
can
retain
it
and
record
any
or
all
of
it
if
such
a
record
is
desired
but
to
the
subject
who
recalls
it
is
a
flowing
away
without
return
thus
it
is
not
a
true
remembering
but
a
giving
the
mind
is
swept
clear
naked
of
all
its
past
and
along
with
memory
life
withdraws
also
very
quietly
at
the
end
i
suppose
it
must
be
like
standing
without
resistance
in
the
engulfment
of
a
flood
tide
until
finally
the
waters
close
over
that
it
seems
is
how
camilla
life
was
saved
when
i
finally
grasped
that
i
laughed
and
the
angel
of
course
caught
the
reason
i
was
thinking
about
my
neighbor
steele
who
boarded
camilla
for
me
in
his
henhouse
for
a
couple
of
winters
somewhere
safe
in
the
angelic
records
there
must
be
a
image
of
the
patch
in
the
seat
of
steele
pants
and
naturally
view
of
me
too
not
too
unkind
i
hope
she
could
help
the
expression
on
her
rigid
little
face
and
i
do
believe
it
ever
meant
anything
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
is
the
saved
life
of
my
angel
father
recall
can
be
a
long
process
she
says
depending
on
the
intricacy
and
richness
of
the
mind
recalling
and
in
all
but
the
last
stages
it
can
be
halted
at
will
her
father
recall
was
begun
when
they
were
still
far
out
in
space
and
he
knew
that
he
could
not
long
survive
the
journey
when
that
journey
ended
the
recall
had
progressed
so
far
that
very
little
actual
memory
remained
to
him
of
his
life
on
that
other
planet
he
had
what
must
be
called
a
deductive
memory
from
the
material
of
the
years
not
yet
given
away
he
could
reconstruct
what
must
have
been
and
i
assume
the
other
adult
who
survived
the
passage
must
have
been
able
to
shelter
him
from
errors
that
loss
of
memory
might
involve
this
i
infer
is
why
he
could
not
show
me
a
night
i
forgot
to
ask
her
whether
the
images
he
did
send
me
were
from
actual
or
deductive
memory
deductive
i
think
for
there
was
a
certain
dimness
about
them
not
present
when
my
angel
gives
me
a
picture
of
something
seen
with
her
own
eyes
eyes
by
the
way
were
you
wondering
in
the
same
fashion
my
own
life
could
be
saved
every
aspect
of
existence
that
i
ever
touched
that
ever
touched
me
could
be
transmitted
to
some
perfect
record
the
nature
of
the
written
record
is
beyond
me
but
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
relative
perfection
nothing
important
good
or
bad
would
be
lost
and
they
need
a
knowledge
of
humanity
if
they
are
to
carry
out
whatever
it
is
they
have
in
mind
it
would
be
difficult
she
tells
me
and
sometimes
painful
most
of
the
effort
would
be
hers
but
some
of
it
would
have
to
be
mine
in
her
period
of
infantile
education
she
elected
what
we
should
call
zoology
as
her
life
work
for
that
reason
she
was
given
intensive
theoretical
training
in
this
technique
right
now
i
guess
she
knows
more
than
anyone
else
on
this
planet
not
only
about
what
makes
a
hen
tick
but
how
it
feels
to
be
a
hen
though
a
beginner
she
is
in
all
essentials
already
an
expert
she
can
help
me
she
thinks
if
i
choose
this
alternative
at
any
rate
she
could
ease
me
over
the
toughest
spots
keep
my
courage
from
flagging
for
it
seems
that
this
process
of
recall
is
painful
to
an
advanced
intellect
without
condescension
she
calls
us
very
advanced
because
while
all
pretense
and
are
stripped
away
there
remains
conscience
still
functioning
by
whatever
standards
of
good
and
bad
the
individual
has
developed
in
his
lifetime
our
present
knowledge
of
our
own
motives
is
such
a
pathetically
small
beginning
hardly
stronger
than
an
infant
first
effort
to
focus
his
eyes
i
am
merely
wondering
how
much
of
my
life
if
i
choose
this
way
will
seem
to
me
altogether
hideous
certainly
plenty
of
the
good
deeds
which
i
still
cherish
in
memory
like
so
many
cherubs
will
turn
up
with
the
leering
aspect
of
greed
or
petty
vanity
or
worse
not
that
i
am
a
bad
man
in
any
reasonable
sense
of
the
term
i
respect
myself
no
occasion
to
grovel
and
beat
my
chest
i
not
ashamed
to
stand
comparison
with
any
other
fair
sample
of
the
species
but
there
you
are
i
human
and
under
the
aspect
of
eternity
so
far
plus
this
afternoon
newspaper
that
is
a
rather
serious
thing
without
real
knowledge
i
think
of
this
total
recall
as
something
like
a
passage
down
a
corridor
of
a
myriad
images
now
dark
now
brilliant
now
pleasant
now
horrible
guided
by
no
certainty
except
an
awareness
of
the
open
blind
door
at
the
end
of
it
it
could
have
its
pleasing
moments
and
its
consolations
i
do
see
how
it
could
ever
approximate
the
delight
and
satisfaction
of
living
a
few
more
years
in
this
world
with
the
angel
lighting
on
my
shoulder
when
she
wishes
and
talking
to
me
i
had
to
ask
her
how
great
a
value
such
a
record
would
be
to
them
obvious
enough
they
can
be
of
little
use
to
us
by
their
standards
until
they
understand
us
and
they
came
here
to
be
of
use
to
us
as
well
as
to
themselves
and
understanding
us
to
them
means
knowing
us
inside
out
with
a
completeness
such
as
our
most
dedicated
and
laborious
scholars
could
never
imagine
i
remember
about
those
twelve
million
years
they
will
not
touch
us
until
they
are
certain
no
harm
will
come
of
it
on
our
tortured
planet
however
there
is
a
time
factor
they
know
that
well
enough
of
course
recall
can
not
begin
unless
the
subject
is
willing
or
unresisting
to
them
that
has
to
mean
willing
for
any
being
with
intellect
enough
to
make
a
considered
choice
now
i
wonder
how
many
they
could
find
who
would
be
honestly
willing
to
make
that
uneasy
journey
into
death
for
no
reward
except
an
assurance
that
they
were
serving
their
own
kind
and
the
angels
more
to
the
point
i
wonder
if
i
would
be
able
to
achieve
such
willingness
myself
even
with
her
help
when
this
had
been
explained
to
me
she
urged
me
again
to
make
no
hasty
decision
and
she
pointed
out
to
me
what
my
thoughts
were
already
groping
at
why
not
both
alternatives
within
a
reasonable
limit
of
time
why
could
i
have
ten
or
fifteen
years
or
more
with
her
and
then
undertake
the
total
recall
perhaps
not
until
my
physical
powers
had
started
toward
senility
i
thought
that
over
this
morning
i
had
almost
decided
to
choose
that
most
welcome
and
comfortable
solution
then
my
daily
paper
was
delivered
not
that
i
needed
any
such
reminder
in
the
afternoon
i
asked
her
if
she
knew
whether
in
the
present
state
of
human
technology
it
would
be
possible
for
our
folly
to
actually
destroy
this
planet
she
did
not
know
for
certain
three
of
the
other
children
have
gone
away
to
different
parts
of
the
world
to
learn
what
they
can
about
that
but
she
had
to
tell
me
that
such
a
thing
has
happened
before
elsewhere
in
the
universe
i
guess
i
wo
write
a
letter
to
the
papers
advancing
an
explanation
for
the
occasional
appearance
of
a
nova
among
the
stars
doubtless
others
have
hit
on
the
same
hypothesis
without
the
aid
of
angels
and
that
is
not
all
i
must
consider
i
could
die
by
accident
or
sudden
disease
before
i
had
begun
to
give
my
life
only
now
at
this
very
late
moment
rubbing
my
sweaty
forehead
and
gazing
into
the
lights
of
that
wonderful
ring
have
i
been
able
to
put
together
some
obvious
facts
in
the
required
synthesis
i
do
know
of
course
what
forms
their
assistance
to
us
will
take
i
suspect
human
beings
wo
see
or
hear
much
of
the
angels
for
a
long
time
to
come
now
and
then
disastrous
decisions
may
be
altered
and
those
who
believe
themselves
wholly
responsible
wo
realize
why
their
minds
worked
that
way
here
and
there
maybe
an
influential
mind
will
be
rather
strangely
nudged
into
a
better
course
something
like
that
there
may
be
new
discoveries
and
inventions
of
kinds
that
will
tend
to
neutralize
the
menace
of
our
nastiest
playthings
but
whatever
the
angels
decide
to
do
the
record
and
analysis
of
my
fairly
typical
life
will
be
an
aid
it
could
even
be
the
small
weight
deciding
the
balance
between
triumph
and
failure
that
is
fact
one
two
my
angel
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
for
all
their
amazing
level
of
advancement
are
also
of
perishable
protoplasm
therefore
if
this
ball
of
mud
becomes
a
ball
of
flame
they
also
will
be
destroyed
even
if
they
have
the
means
to
use
their
spaceship
again
or
to
build
another
it
might
easily
happen
that
they
would
not
learn
their
danger
in
time
to
escape
and
for
all
i
know
this
could
be
tomorrow
or
tonight
so
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
as
to
my
choice
and
i
will
tell
her
when
she
wakes
july
tonight
there
is
no
recall
i
am
to
rest
a
while
i
see
it
is
almost
a
month
since
i
last
wrote
in
this
journal
my
total
recall
began
three
weeks
ago
and
already
the
first
years
of
my
life
have
been
saved
footnote
at
this
point
bannerman
handwriting
alters
curiously
from
here
on
he
used
a
soft
pencil
instead
of
a
pen
and
the
script
shows
signs
of
haste
in
spite
of
this
however
it
is
actually
much
clearer
steadier
and
easier
to
read
than
the
earlier
entries
in
his
normal
blaine
it
was
a
week
after
i
told
the
angel
my
decision
before
she
was
prepared
to
start
the
recall
during
that
week
she
searched
my
present
mind
more
closely
than
i
should
have
imagined
was
possible
she
had
to
be
sure
during
that
week
of
hard
questions
i
dare
say
she
learned
more
about
my
kind
than
has
ever
gone
on
record
even
in
a
physician
office
i
hope
she
did
to
any
psychiatrist
who
might
question
that
i
offer
a
naturalist
suggestion
it
is
easy
to
imagine
after
some
laborious
time
that
we
have
noticed
everything
a
given
patch
of
ground
can
show
us
but
alter
the
only
a
little
dig
down
a
foot
with
a
spade
say
or
climb
a
and
look
downward
it
a
whole
new
world
when
the
angel
was
not
exploring
me
in
this
fashion
she
took
pains
to
make
me
glimpse
the
satisfactions
and
million
rewarding
experiences
i
might
have
if
i
chose
the
other
way
i
see
how
necessary
that
was
at
the
time
it
seemed
almost
cruel
she
had
to
do
it
for
my
own
sake
and
i
am
glad
that
i
was
somehow
able
to
stand
fast
to
my
original
choice
so
was
she
in
the
end
she
has
even
said
she
loves
me
for
it
what
that
troubling
word
means
to
her
is
not
within
my
mind
i
am
satisfied
to
take
it
in
the
human
sense
since
i
no
longer
require
normal
sleep
the
recall
begins
at
night
as
soon
as
the
lights
begin
to
go
out
in
the
village
and
there
is
little
danger
of
interruption

putter
about
in

i
have
sold

my

judy

week
ago
that
practically
winds
up
my

that
i
went
to
write
a
codicil
to
my
will
i
might
as
well
do
that
now
right
here
in
this
journal
instead
of
bothering
my
lawyer

should
be
legal

whom
it
may
concern

hereby
bequeath
to
my

the
ring
which
will
be
found
at
my
death
on
the
fifth
finger
of
my
left
hand
i
would
urge
morse
to
retain
this
ring
in
his
private
possession
at
all
times
and
to
make
provision
for
its
disposal
in
the
event
of
his
own
death
to
some
person
in
whose
character
he
places
the
utmost

i

it

spotty

there
is
so
much
i
no

effects
thus
far
i
have
no
faintest
recollection
of
anything
that
happened
earlier
than
my
birthday
my
deductive
memory
seems
rather
efficient
and
i
am
sure
i
could
reconstruct
most
of
the
story
if
it
were
worth
the
bother
this
afternoon
i
grubbed
around
among
some
old
letters
of
that
period
but
they
were
very
interesting
my
knowledge
of
english
is
unaffected
i
can
still
read
scientific
german
and
some
french
because
i
had
occasion
to
use
those
languages
fairly
often
after
i
was
the
scraps
of
latin
dating
from
high
school
are
gone
so
are
algebra
and
all
but
the
simplest
proposition
of
high
school
geometry
i
never
needed
them
i
can
remember
thinking
of
my
mother
after
but
i
do
not
know
whether
the
image
this
provides
really
resembles
her
my
father
died
when
i
was
so
i
remember
him
as
a
sick
old
man
i
believe
i
had
a
younger
brother
but
he
must
have
died
in
childhood
footnote
bannerman
mother
died
in
of
influenza
his
brother
three
years
older
not
younger
died
of
pneumonia
blaine
judy
passing
was
tranquil
pleasant
for
her
i
think
it
took
the
better
part
of
a
day
we
went
out
to
an
abandoned
field
i
know
and
she
lay
blinking
in
the
sunshine
with
the
angel
sitting
by
her
while
i
dug
a
grave
and
then
rambled
off
after
wild
raspberries
toward
evening
the
angel
came
and
told
me
i
could
bury
judy
it
was
finished
and
most
interesting
she
said
i
do
see
how
there
can
have
been
anything
distressing
about
it
for
judy
after
all
what
hurts
us
worst
is
to
have
our
favorite
stripped
away
and
i
do
think
judy
had
any
i
have
not
found
the
recall
painful
at
least
not
in
retrospect
there
must
have
been
sharp
moments
mercifully
forgotten
along
with
their
causes
as
if
the
process
had
gone
on
under
anesthesia
certainly
there
were
plenty
of
incidents
in
my
first
years
which
i
should
not
care
to
offer
to
the
understanding
of
any
but
the
angels
quite
often
i
must
have
been
mean
selfish
base
in
any
number
of
ways
if
only
to
judge
by
the
record
since
those
old
letters
touch
on
a
few
of
these
things
to
me
they
now
matter
only
as
material
for
a
record
which
is
safely
out
of
my
hands
however
to
any
person
i
may
have
harmed
i
wish
to
say
this
you
were
hurt
by
aspects
of
my
humanity
which
may
not
in
a
few
million
years
be
quite
so
common
among
us
against
these
darker
elements
i
struggled
in
my
human
fashion
as
you
do
yourselves
the
effort
is
not
wasted
one
evening
i
think
it
was
june
lester
dropped
around
for
sherry
and
chess
had
seen
him
in
quite
a
while
and
have
since
there
is
a
moderate
polio
scare
this
summer
and
it
keeps
him
on
the
jump
the
angel
retired
behind
some
books
on
an
upper
shelf
i
afraid
it
was
dusty
and
had
fun
with
our
chess
she
had
a
fair
view
of
your
bald
spot
lester
later
she
remarked
that
she
liked
your
looks
but
ca
you
do
something
about
that
weight
she
suggested
an
odd
expedient
which
i
believe
has
occurred
to
your
medical
self
from
time
to
time
eating
less
maybe
she
should
have
done
what
she
did
with
those
chess
games
nothing
more
than
my
usual
blundering
happened
until
after
my
first
ten
moves
by
that
time
i
suppose
she
had
absorbed
the
principles
and
she
took
over
i
was
not
fully
aware
of
it
until
i
saw
you
looking
like
a
boiled
duck
i
had
imagined
my
astonishing
moves
were
the
result
of
my
own
damn
cleverness
seriously
lester
think
back
to
that
evening
you
played
in
stiff
amateur
tournaments
you
know
your
own
abilities
and
you
know
mine
ask
yourself
whether
i
could
have
done
anything
like
that
without
help
i
tell
you
again
i
did
study
the
game
in
the
interval
when
you
here
i
never
even
had
a
chess
book
in
the
library
and
if
i
had
no
amount
of
study
would
take
me
into
your
class
i
have
that
sort
of
mentality
just
your
humble
sparring
partner
and
i
enjoyed
it
on
that
basis
as
you
might
enjoy
watching
a
prima
donna
surgeon
pull
off
some
miracle
you
would
dream
of
attempting
yourself
even
if
your
game
had
been
away
below
par
that
evening
and
i
do
think
it
was
i
could
never
have
pinned
your
ears
back
three
times
running
without
help
that
evening
you
were
a
long
way
out
of
class
that
all
i
could
tell
you
anything
about
it
at
the
time
she
was
clear
on
that
point
so
i
could
only
bumble
and
preen
myself
and
leave
you
mystified
but
she
wants
me
to
write
anything
i
choose
in
this
journal
and
somehow
lester
i
think
you
may
find
the
next
few
decades
pretty
interesting
you
still
young
some
ten
years
younger
than
i
think
you
see
many
things
that
i
wish
i
might
see
come
to
pass
or
i
would
so
wish
if
i
were
not
convinced
that
my
choice
was
the
right
one
most
of
those
new
events
will
not
be
spectacular
i
guess
many
of
the
turns
to
a
better
way
will
hardly
be
recognized
at
the
time
for
what
they
are
by
you
or
anyone
else
obviously
our
nature
being
what
it
is
we
shall
not
change
overnight
to
hope
for
that
would
be
as
absurd
as
it
is
to
imagine
that
any
formula
ideology
theory
of
social
pattern
can
bring
us
into
utopia
as
i
see
it
lester
and
i
think
your
consulting
room
would
have
told
you
the
same
even
if
your
own
intuition
were
not
enough
there
is
only
one
battle
of
importance
armageddon
and
armageddon
field
is
within
each
individual
at
the
moment
i
believe
i
am
the
happiest
man
who
ever
lived
july
all
but
the
last
ten
years
are
now
given
away
the
physical
fatigue
though
still
pleasant
is
quite
overwhelming
i
am
not
troubled
by
the
weeds
in
my
garden
patch
merely
a
different
sort
of
flowers
where
i
had
planned
something
else
an
hour
ago
she
brought
me
the
seed
of
a
blown
dandelion
to
show
me
how
lovely
it
was
i
do
suppose
i
had
ever
noticed
i
hope
whoever
takes
over
this
place
will
bring
it
back
to
farming
they
say
the
ten
acres
below
the
house
used
to
be
good
potato
land
nice
early
ground
it
is
delightful
to
sit
in
the
sun
as
if
i
were
old
after
thumbing
over
earlier
entries
in
this
journal
i
see
i
have
often
felt
quite
bitter
toward
my
own
kind
i
deduce
that
i
must
have
been
a
lonely
man
with
much
of
the
loneliness
a
great
part
of
my
bitterness
must
have
been
no
more
than
one
ugly
of
a
life
spent
too
much
apart
some
of
it
doubtless
came
from
objective
causes
yet
i
do
believe
i
ever
had
more
cause
than
any
moderately
intelligent
man
who
would
like
to
see
his
world
a
pleasanter
place
than
it
has
been
my
angel
tells
me
that
the
scar
on
my
back
is
due
to
an
injury
received
in
some
early
stage
of
the
war
that
still
goes
on
that
could
have
soured
me
perhaps
it
all
right
it
in
the
record
she
is
racing
with
a
hummingbird
holding
back
i
think
to
give
the
swift
little
green
fluff
a
break
another
note
for
you
lester
i
have
already
indicated
my
ring
is
to
be
yours
i
do
want
to
tell
you
what
i
have
discovered
of
its
properties
for
fear
it
might
not
give
you
the
same
pleasure
and
interest
that
it
has
given
me
of
course
like
any
spot
of
shifting
light
and
color
it
is
an
aid
to
it
is
more
much
more
than
that
but
find
out
for
yourself
at
some
time
when
you
are
a
little
protected
from
everyday
distractions
i
know
it
ca
harm
you
because
i
know
its
source
by
the
way
i
wish
you
would
convey
to
my
publishers
my
request
that
they
either
discontinue
printing
my
or
else
bring
out
a
new
edition
revised
in
accordance
with
some
notes
you
will
find
in
the
top
left
drawer
of
my
library
desk
i
glanced
through
that
book
after
my
angel
assured
me
that
i
wrote
it
and
i
was
amazed
however
i
afraid
my
notes
are
messy
i
call
them
mine
by
a
poetic
license
and
they
may
be
too
advanced
for
the
present
day
though
the
revision
is
mainly
a
matter
of
leaving
out
certain
generalities
that
are
so
use
your
best
judgment
it
a
very
minor
textbook
and
the
thing
is
too
important
a
last
wriggle
of
my
vanishing
personal
vanity
july
i
have
seen
a
night
it
was
given
to
me
by
that
remaining
at
the
end
of
a
wonderful
visit
when
he
and
six
of
those
nine
other
children
came
to
see
me
it
was
last
night
i
think
yes
must
have
been
first
there
was
a
murmur
of
wings
above
the
house
my
angel
flew
in
laughing
then
they
were
here
all
about
me
full
of
gaiety
and
colored
fire
showing
off
in
every
way
they
knew
would
please
me
each
one
had
something
graceful
and
friendly
to
say
to
me
one
brought
me
a
moving
image
of
the
lawrence
seen
at
morning
from
half
a
mile
up
clouds
eagles
now
how
could
he
know
that
would
delight
me
so
much
and
each
one
thanked
me
for
what
i
had
done
but
it
been
so
easy
and
at
the
end
the
old
one
his
skin
is
quite
black
and
his
down
is
white
and
gray
gave
the
remembered
image
of
a
night
he
saw
it
some
sixty
years
ago
i
have
not
even
considered
making
an
effort
to
describe
it
my
fingers
will
not
hold
this
pencil
much
longer
tonight
oh
soaring
buildings
of
white
and
amber
untroubled
countryside
silver
on
curling
rivers
a
glimpse
of
open
sea
a
moon
rising
in
clarity
another
setting
in
a
wreath
of
cloud
between
them
a
wide
wandering
of
unfamiliar
stars
here
and
there
the
angels
worthy
after
fifty
million
years
to
live
in
such
night
no
i
can
not
describe
anything
like
that
but
you
human
kindred
of
mine
i
can
do
something
better
i
can
tell
you
that
this
night
glorious
as
it
was
was
no
more
beautiful
than
a
night
under
a
single
moon
on
this
ancient
and
familiar
earth
might
be
if
you
will
imagine
that
human
evil
has
been
cleared
away
and
that
our
own
people
have
started
at
last
on
the
greatest
of
all
explorations
themselves
july
nothing
now
remains
to
give
away
but
the
memory
of
the
time
that
has
passed
since
the
angel
came
i
am
to
rest
as
long
as
i
wish
write
whatever
i
want
then
i
shall
get
myself
over
to
the
bed
and
lie
down
as
if
for
sleep
she
tells
me
that
i
can
keep
my
eyes
open
she
will
close
them
for
me
when
i
no
longer
see
her
i
remain
convinced
that
our
human
case
is
hopeful
i
feel
sure
that
in
only
a
few
thousand
years
we
may
be
able
to
perform
some
of
the
simpler
preparatory
tasks
such
as
casting
out
evil
and
loving
our
neighbors
and
if
that
should
prove
to
be
so
who
can
doubt
that
in
another
few
million
years
or
even
less
we
might
be
only
a
little
lower
than
the
angels

to
have

but
no

to
have
been

was

of
duty
december
mccarran
is
believed
not
to
have
written
about
nor
discussed
the
bannerman
affair
with
anyone
else
it
is
almost
certain
that
he
himself
removed
the
extract
and
related
papers
from
the
files
unofficially
it
would
seem
when
he
severed
his
connection
with
the
fbi
in
at
any
rate
they
were
found
among
his
effects
after
his
assassination
and
were
released
to
the
public

later
by

originally
attached

of
complaint
written
by
stephen
clyde
and
mentioned
in
the
accompanying

unfortunately
been

owing
perhaps
to

not

to

repeated
except
if
as

there
was
a
penciled

later
erased
iodine
vapor
has
been
used
to
bring
out
the
unmistakable

the
notation
read
in
part
as
follows
be
it
from
a
mcc
to
lose
his
job
except
if
as
and
the
rest
is
undecipherable
except
for
a
terminal
word
which
is
regrettably
unparliamentary
statement
by
lester
morse
dated
august
on
the
afternoon
of
july
acting
on
what
i
am
obliged
to
describe
as
an
unexpected
impulse
i
drove
out
to
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
calling
on
my
friend
david
bannerman
i
had
not
seen
him
nor
had
word
from
him
since
the
evening
of
june
of
this
year
after
knocking
calling
to
him
and
hearing
no
response
i
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
and
found
him
dead
from
superficial
indications
i
judged
that
death
must
have
taken
place
during
the
previous
night
he
was
lying
on
his
bed
on
his
left
side
comfortably
disposed
as
if
for
sleep
but
fully
dressed
with
a
fresh
shirt
and
clean
summer
slacks
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
closed
and
there
was
no
trace
of
the
disorder
to
be
expected
at
even
the
easiest
death
because
of
these
signs
i
assumed
soon
as
i
had
determined
the
absence
of
breath
and
heartbeat
and
noted
the
chill
of
the
body
that
some
neighbor
must
have
already
found
him
performed
these
simple
rites
of
respect
for
him
and
probably
notified
a
local
physician
or
other
responsible
person
i
therefore
waited
bannerman
had
no
telephone
expecting
that
someone
would
soon
call
bannerman
journal
was
on
a
table
near
his
bed
open
to
that
page
on
which
he
had
written
a
codicil
to
his
will
i
read
that
part
later
while
i
was
waiting
for
others
to
come
i
read
the
remainder
of
the
journal
as
he
apparently
wished
me
to
do
the
ring
he
mentions
was
on
the
fifth
finger
of
his
left
hand
and
it
is
now
in
my
possession
when
writing
that
codicil
bannerman
must
have
overlooked
or
forgotten
the
fact
that
in
his
formal
will
written
some
months
earlier
he
had
appointed
me
executor
if
there
are
legal
technicalities
involved
i
shall
be
pleased
to
fully
with
the
proper
authorities
the
ring
however
will
remain
in
my
keeping
since
that
was
bannerman
expressed
wish
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
offer
it
for
examination
or
discussion
under
any
circumstances
the
notes
for
a
revision
of
one
of
his
textbooks
were
in
his
desk
as
indicated
in
the
journal
they
are
by
no
means
messy
nor
are
they
particularly
revolutionary
except
in
so
far
as
he
wished
to
as
theory
or
hypothesis
certain
statements
which
i
would
have
regarded
as
axiomatic
this
is
not
my
field
and
i
am
not
competent
to
judge
i
shall
take
up
the
matter
with
his
publishers
at
the
earliest
opportunity
footnote
librarian
note
but
it
seems
he
never
did
no
new
edition
of
introductory
biology
was
ever
brought
out
and
the
textbook
has
been
out
of
print
since
so
far
as
i
can
determine
and
bearing
in
mind
the
results
of
the
autopsy
performed
by
stephen
clyde
the
death
of
david
bannerman
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
presence
of
an
embolism
of
some
type
not
distinguishable
on
post
mortem
i
have
so
stated
on
the
certificate
of
death
i
am
compelled
to
add
one
other
item
of
medical
opinion
for
what
it
may
be
worth
i
am
not
a
psychiatrist
but
owing
to
the
demands
of
general
practise
i
have
found
it
advisable
to
keep
as
up
to
date
as
possible
with
current
findings
and
opinion
in
this
branch
of
medicine
bannerman
possessed
in
my
opinion
emotional
and
intellectual
stability
to
a
higher
degree
than
anyone
else
of
comparable
intelligence
in
the
entire
field
of
my
acquaintance
personal
and
professional
if
it
is
suggested
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
hallucinatory
psychosis
i
can
only
say
that
it
must
have
been
of
a
type
quite
outside
my
experience
and
not
described
so
far
as
i
know
anywhere
in
the
literature
of
psychopathology
bannerman
house
on
the
afternoon
of
july
was
in
good
order
near
the
open
unscreened
window
of
his
bedroom
there
was
a
coverless
shoebox
with
a
folded
silk
scarf
in
the
bottom
i
found
no
pillow
such
as
bannerman
describes
in
the
journal
but
observed
that
a
small
section
had
been
cut
from
the
scarf
in
this
box
and
near
it
there
was
a
peculiar
fragrance
faint
aromatic
very
sweet
such
as
i
have
never
encountered
before
and
therefore
can
not
describe
it
may
or
may
not
have
any
bearing
on
the
case
that
while
i
remained
in
his
house
that
afternoon
i
felt
no
sense
of
grief
or
personal
loss
although
bannerman
had
been
a
loved
and
honored
friend
for
a
number
of
years
i
merely
had
and
have
a
conviction
that
after
the
completion
of
some
very
great
undertaking
he
had
found
peace
the
ring
he
bequeathed
to
me
has
confirmed
that
