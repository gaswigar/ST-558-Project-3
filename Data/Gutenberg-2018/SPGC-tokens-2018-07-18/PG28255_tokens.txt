beard
because
of
his
love
of
the
big
outdoors
foreword
as
this
book
is
written
for
boys
of
all
ages
it
has
been
divided
under
two
general
heads
the
tomahawk
camps
and
the
axe
camps
that
is
camps
which
may
be
built
with
no
tool
but
a
hatchet
and
camps
that
will
need
the
aid
of
an
axe
the
smallest
boys
can
build
some
of
the
simple
shelters
and
the
older
boys
can
build
the
more
difficult
ones
the
reader
may
if
he
likes
begin
with
the
first
of
the
book
build
his
way
through
it
and
graduate
by
building
the
log
houses
in
doing
this
he
will
be
closely
following
the
history
of
the
human
race
because
ever
since
our
arboreal
ancestors
with
prehensile
toes
scampered
among
the
branches
of
the
forests
and
built
nestlike
shelters
in
the
trees
men
have
made
themselves
shacks
for
a
temporary
refuge
but
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
club
of
america
as
one
of
the
founders
of
the
boy
scouts
of
america
and
as
the
founder
of
the
boy
pioneers
of
america
it
would
not
be
proper
for
the
author
to
admit
for
one
moment
that
there
can
be
such
a
thing
as
a
camp
without
a
and
for
that
reason
the
tree
folks
and
the
missing
link
whose
remains
were
found
in
java
and
to
whom
the
scientists
gave
the
name
of
pithecanthropus
erectus
can
not
be
counted
as
campers
because
did
not
know
how
to
build
a
neither
can
we
admit
the
ancient
maker
of
stone
implements
called
eoliths
to
be
one
of
us
because
he
too
knew
not
the
joys
of
a
but
there
was
another
fellow
called
the
neanderthal
man
who
lived
in
the
ice
age
in
europe
and
he
to
be
a
man
or
freeze
as
far
as
we
know
he
was
the
first
man
to
build
a
the
cold
weather
made
him
hustle
and
hustling
developed
him
true
he
did
cook
and
eat
his
neighbors
once
in
a
while
and
even
split
their
bones
for
the
marrow
but
we
will
forget
that
part
and
just
remember
him
as
the
first
camper
in
europe
recently
a
pygmy
skeleton
was
discovered
near
los
angeles
which
is
claimed
to
be
about
twenty
thousand
years
old
but
we
do
not
know
whether
this
man
knew
how
to
build
a
fire
or
not
we
do
know
however
that
the
american
camper
was
here
on
this
continent
when
our
bible
was
yet
an
unfinished
manuscript
and
that
he
was
building
his
fires
toasting
his
venison
and
building
sheds
when
the
eric
settled
in
greenland
when
thorwald
fought
with
the
skraelings
and
biarni
dragon
ship
made
the
trip
down
the
coast
of
vineland
about
the
dawn
of
the
christian
era
we
also
know
that
the
american
camper
was
here
when
columbus
with
his
comical
toy
ships
was
blundering
around
the
west
indies
we
also
know
that
the
american
camper
watched
henry
hudson
steer
the
around
manhattan
island
it
is
this
same
american
camper
who
has
taught
us
to
build
many
of
the
shacks
to
be
found
in
the
following
pages
the
shacks
sheds
shanties
and
shelters
described
in
the
following
pages
are
all
of
them
similar
to
those
used
by
the
people
on
this
continent
or
suggested
by
the
ones
in
use
and
are
typically
american
and
the
designs
are
suited
to
the
arctics
the
tropics
and
temperate
climes
also
to
the
plains
the
mountains
the
desert
the
bog
and
even
the
water
it
seems
to
be
natural
and
proper
to
follow
the
camp
as
it
grows
until
it
develops
into
a
somewhat
pretentious
log
house
but
this
book
must
not
be
considered
as
competing
in
any
manner
with
professional
architects
the
buildings
here
suggested
require
a
woodsman
more
than
an
architect
the
work
demands
more
the
skill
of
the
axeman
than
that
of
the
carpenter
and
joiner
the
log
houses
are
supposed
to
be
buildings
which
any
real
outdoor
man
should
be
able
to
erect
by
himself
and
for
himself
many
of
the
buildings
have
already
been
built
in
many
parts
of
the
country
by
boy
pioneers
and
boy
scouts
this
book
is
not
intended
as
an
encyclopedia
or
history
of
primitive
architecture
the
bureaus
at
washington
and
the
museum
of
natural
history
are
better
equipped
for
that
purpose
than
the
author
the
boys
will
undoubtedly
acquire
a
dexterity
and
skill
in
building
the
shacks
and
shanties
here
described
which
will
be
of
lasting
benefit
to
them
whether
they
acquire
the
skill
by
building
camps
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
or
in
building
them
for
the
more
practical
purpose
of
furnishing
shelter
for
overnight
pleasure
hikes
for
the
wilderness
trail
or
for
permanent
camps
while
living
in
the
open
it
has
been
the
writer
experience
that
the
readers
depend
more
upon
his
diagrams
than
they
do
upon
the
written
matter
in
his
books
and
so
in
this
book
he
has
again
attempted
to
make
the
diagrams
the
book
was
written
in
answer
to
requests
by
many
people
interested
in
the
boy
scout
movement
and
others
interested
in
the
general
activities
of
boys
and
also
in
answer
to
the
personal
demands
of
hundreds
of
boys
and
many
men
the
drawings
are
all
original
and
many
of
them
invented
by
the
author
himself
and
published
here
for
the
first
time
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
all
the
boy
readers
the
boy
scouts
and
other
older
boys
calling
themselves
scoutmasters
and
sportsmen
with
practical
hints
drawings
and

how
to
build
suitable
shelters

where

how

it
may
be
necessary
for
me
to
remind
the
boys
that
they
must
use
the
material
at
hand
in
building
their
shacks
shelters
sheds
and
shanties
and
that
they
are
very
fortunate
if
their
camp
is
located
in
a
country
where
the
mountain
goose
is
to
be
found
the
mountain
goose
from
labrador
down
to
the
northwestern
borders
of
new
england
and
new
york
and
from
thence
to
southwestern
virginia
north
carolina
and
tennessee
the
woodsman
and
camper

make
their

from
the
feathers
of
the
mountain
goose
the
mountain
goose
is
also
found
inhabiting
the
frozen
soil
of
alaska
and
following
the
pacific
and
the
rocky
mountains
the
abies
make
their
as
far
south
as
guatemala
consequently
the
abies
or
mountain
goose
should
be
a
familiar
friend
of
all
the
scouts
who
live
in
the
mountainous
country

i
forgot
to
say
that
the
mountain
goose
figs
and
is
not
a
bird
but
a
tree
it
is
humorously
called
a
goose
by
the
woodsmen
because
they
all
make
their
beds
of
its
feathers

known
by
the
botanist
as

there
is
nothing
in
nature
which
has
a
wilder
more
sylvan
and
charming
perfume
than
the
balsam

has
not

woods

pleasure

balsam
beds
the
balsam
bed
is
made
of
the
small
twigs
of
in
gathering
these
collect
twigs
of
different
lengths
from
eighteen
inches
long
to
be
used
as
the
foundation
of
the
bed
to
ten
or
twelve
inches
long
for
the
top
layer
if
you
want
to
rest
well
do
not
economize
on
the
amount
you
gather
many
a
time
i
have
had
my
bones
ache
as
a
result
of
being
too
tired
to
make
my
bed
properly
and
attempting
to
sleep
on
a
thin
layer
of
boughs
if
you
attempt
to
chop
off
the
boughs
of
balsam
they
will
resent
your
effort
by
springing
back
and
slapping
you
in
the
face
you
can
cut
them
with
your
knife
but
it
is
slow
work
and
will
blister
your
hands
take
twig
by
twig
with
the
thumb
and
fingers
the
thumb
on
top
pointing
toward
the
tip
of
the
bough
and
the
two
forefingers
underneath
press
down
with
the
thumb
and
with
a
twist
of
the
wrist
you
can
snap
the
twigs
like
fig
shows
two
views
of
the
hands
in
a
proper
position
to
snap
off
twigs
easily
and
clean
the
one
at
the
left
shows
the
hand
as
it
would
appear
looking
down
upon
it
the
one
at
the
right
shows
the
view
as
you
look
at
it
from
the
side
packing
boughs
after
collecting
a
handful
of
boughs
string
them
on
a
stick
which
you
have
previously
prepared
fig
this
stick
should
be
of
strong
green
hardwood
four
or
five
feet
long
with
a
fork
about
six
inches
long
left
on
it
at
the
butt
end
to
keep
the
boughs
from
sliding
off
and
sharpened
at
the
upper
end
so
that
it
can
be
easily
poked
through
a
handful
of
boughs
string
the
boughs
on
this
stick
as
you
would
string
fish
but
do
it
one
handful
at
a
time
allowing
the
butts
to
point
in
different
directions
it
is
astonishing
to
see
the
amount
of
boughs
you
can
carry
when
strung
on
a
stick
in
this
manner
and
thrown
over
your
shoulder
as
in
fig
if
you
have
a
lash
rope
place
the
boughs
on
a
loop
of
the
rope
as
in
fig
then
bring
the
two
ends
of
the
rope
up
through
the
loop
and
sling
the
bundle
on
your
back
clean
your
hands
when
you
have
finished
gathering
the
material
for
your
bed
your
hands
will
be
covered
with
a
sticky
sap
and
although
they
will
be
a
sorry
sight
a
little
lard
or
baking
grease
will
soften
the
pitchy
substance
so
that
it
may
be
washed
off
with
soap
and
water
how
to
make
beds
to
make
your
bed
spread
a
layer
of
the
larger
boughs
on
the
ground
commence
at
the
head
and
shingle
them
down
to
the
foot
so
that
the
tips
point
toward
the
head
of
the
bed
overlapping
the
butts
fig
continue
this
until
your
mattress
is
thick
enough
to
make
a
soft
couch
upon
which
you
can
sleep
as
comfortably
as
you
do
at
home
cover
the
couch
with
one
blanket
and
use
the
bag
containing
your
coat
extra
clothes
and
sweater
for
a
pillow
then
if
you
do
not
sleep
well
you
must
blame
the
cook
other
bedding
if
you
should
happen
to
be
camping
in
a
country
destitute
of
balsam
hemlock
or
pine
you
can
make
a
good
spring
mattress
by
collecting
small
green
branches
of
any
sort
of
tree
which
is
springy
and
elastic
build
the
mattress
as
already
described
on
top
of
this
put
a
thick
layer
of
hay
straw
or
dry
leaves
or
even
green
material
provided
you
have
a
rubber
blanket
or
poncho
to
cover
the
latter
in
kentucky
i
have
made
a
mattress
of
this
description
and
covered
the
branches
with
a
thick
layer
of
the
purple
blossoms
of
ironweed
over
this
i
spread
a
rubber
army
blanket
to
keep
out
the
moisture
from
the
green
stuff
and
on
top
of
this
made
my
bed
with
my
other
blankets
it
was
as
comfortable
a
couch
as
i
have
ever
slept
on
in
fact
it
was
literally
a
bed
of
flowers
ii
the
shelter
the
first
object
of
a
roof
of
any
kind
is
protection
against
the
weather
no
shelter
is
necessary
in
fair
weather
unless
the
sun
in
the
day
or
the
dampness
or
coolness
of
the
night
cause
discomfort
in
parts
of
the
west
there
is
so
little
rain
that
a
tent
is
often
an
unnecessary
burden
but
in
the
east
and
the
other
parts
of
the
country
some
sort
of
shelter
is
necessary
for
health
and
comfort
the
original
american
was
always
quick
to
see
the
advantages
offered
by
an
overhanging
cliff
for
a
camp
site
figs
his
simple
camps
all
through
the
arid
southwest
had
gradually
turned
into
carefully
built
houses
long
before
we
came
here
the
overhanging
cliffs
protected
the
buildings
from
the
rain
and
weather
and
the
site
was
easily
defended
from
enemies
but
while
these
had
reached
the
dignity
of
castles
in
the
southwest
in
the
eastern
states
pennsylvania
for
instance
the
iroquois
indians
were
making
primitive
camps
and
using
every
available
overhanging
cliff
for
that
purpose
any
one
may
use
a
pointed
stick
on
the
floor
of
one
of
these
half
caves
and
unearth

by

man
in

half
caves
the
projecting
ledges
of
bluestone
that
have
horizontal
seams
form
half
caves
from
the
falling
apart
of
the
lower
layers
of
the
cliff
caused
by
rain
and
ice
and
often
aided
by
the
fine
roots
of
the
black
birch
rock
oak
and
other
plants
until
nature
has
worked
long
enough
as
a
and
produced
half
caves
large
enough
to
shelter
a
stooping
man
figs
and
although
not
always
necessary
it
is
sometimes
best
to
make
a
shelter
for
the
open
face
of
such
a
cave
even
if
we
only
need
it
for
a
temporary
camp
fig
this
may
be
done
by
resting
poles
slanting
against
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
over
these
making
a
covering
of
balsam
pine
hemlock
palmetto
palm
branches
or
any
available
material
for
thatch
to
shed
the
rain
and
prevent
it
driving
under
the
cliff
to
wet
our
bedding
walls
it
is
not
always
necessary
to
thatch
the
wall
a
number
of
green
boughs
with
leaves
adhering
may
be
rested
against
the
cliffs
and
will
answer
for
that
purpose
set
the
boughs
upside
down
so
that
they
will
shed
the
rain
and
not
hold
it
so
as
to
drip
into
camp
use
your
common
sense
and
gumption
which
will
teach
you
that
all
the
boughs
should
point
downward
and
not
upward
as
most
of
them
naturally
grow
i
am
careful
to
call
your
attention
to
this
because
i
lately
saw
some
men
teaching
boy
scouts
how
to
make
camps
and
they
were
placing
the
boughs
for
the
lads
around
the
shelter
with
their
branches
pointing
upward
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
not
shed
the
rain
these
instructors
were
city
men
and
apparently
thought
that
the
boughs
were
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
give
privacy
to
the
occupants
of
the
shelter
forgetting
that
in
the
wilds
the
wilderness
itself
furnishes
privacy

the
shelter
the
half
cave
was
probably
the
first
or
shelter
in
this
country
but
overhanging
cliffs
are
not
always
found
where
we
wish
to
make
our
camp
and
we
must
resort
to
other
forms
of
shelter
and
the
use
of
other
material
in
such
localities
iii
how
to
make
the
shelter
and
the
now
that
you
know
how
to
make
a
bed
in
a
half
cave
we
will
take
up
the
most
simple
and
primitive
manufactured
shelters
shelter
for
a
stand
select
a
and
cut
it
partly
through
the
trunk
so
that
it
will
fall
as
shown
in
fig
then
trim
off
the
branches
on
the
so
as
to
leave
room
to
make
your
bed
beneath
the
branches
next
trim
the
branches
off
the
top
or
roof
of
the
trunk
and
with
them
thatch
the
roof
do
this
by
setting
the
branches
with
their
butts
up
as
shown
in
the
shelter
of
fig
and
then
thatch
with
smaller
browse
as
described
in
making
the
bed
this
will
make
a
cosey
shelter
the
or
take
three
forked
sticks
and
fig
and
interlock
the
forked
ends
so
that
they
will
stand
as
shown
in
fig
over
this
framework
rest
branches
with
the
butt
ends
up
as
shown
in
the
shelter
fig
or
lay
a
number
of
poles
as
shown
in
the
figure
fig
and
thatch
this
with
browse
as
illustrated
by
the
shelter
in
fig
or
take
elm
spruce
or
birch
bark
and
shingle
as
in
fig
these
shelters
may
be
built
for
one
boy
or
they
may
be
made
large
enough
for
several
men
they
may
be
thatched
with
balsam

the

has
enough
common
sense
and
sufficient
love
of
the
woods
to
prevent
him
from
killing
or
marring
and
disfiguring
trees
where
trees
are
not
plenty
and
this
restriction
includes
all
settled
or
partially
settled
parts
of
the
country
but
in
the
real
forests
and
wilderness
miles
and
miles
away
from
human
habitation
there
are
few
campers
and
consequently
there
will
be
fewer
trees
injured
and
these
few
will
not
be
missed
selecting
bark
to
get
the

clean

you
seek

woods
for
a
comparatively
smooth
trunk

proceed
in

manner

take
it
off
a
standing
tree
cut
one

another
as
high
as
you
can
reach

slit
it
along
a
perpendicular
line
connecting
the
two
cuts
as
in

this
will
doubtless
in
time
kill
the
tree

the
great
advantage
of
this
sort
of
shelter
is
that
it
is
much
easier
to
do
your
thatching

is
also
a
new
style
of

intended

as
you
would

also
used
across

upon
which
to
place
the
bundles
of
fagots
or
twigs
twigs
is
probably
the
best
term
to
use
here
as
fagots
might
be
thought
to
mean
larger
sticks
which
may
be
stiff
and
obstinate
and
hard
to
handle
roofs
after
the
walls
are
erected
a
roof
may
be
placed
upon

as
shown
in

thatched
with
small
sticks
over
which
a
thatch
of
straw
hay
rushes

and
or
browse
may
be
used
to
shed
the
rain
one
great
advantage
which
recommends
the
and
fagot
camp
to
lovers
of
nature
and
students
of
forestry
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
cut
down
or
destroy
a
single
large
or
valuable
young
tree
in
order
to
procure
the
material
necessary
to
make
the
camp
both
of
these
camps
can
be
made
in
forest
lands
by
using
the
lower
branches
of
the
trees
which
when
properly
cut
close
to
the
trunk
fig
do
not
injure
the
standing
timber
the
fagot
hut
may
be
made
into
a
permanent
camp
by
plastering
the
outside
with
soft
mud
or
clay
and
treating
the
inside
walls
in
the
same
manner
thus
transforming
it
into
an
adobe
shack
vi
indian
shacks
and
shelters
while
the
ingenuity
of
the
white
man
may
make
improvements
upon
the
arbors
huts
and
shelters
of
the
native
red
man
we
must
not
forget
that
these
native
shelters
have
been
used
with
success
by
the
indians
for
centuries
also
we
must
not
forget
that
our
principal
objection
to
many
of
them
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
are
ill
ventilated
and
dirty
both
of
which
defects
may
be
remedied
without
materially
departing
from
the
lines
laid
down
by
the
savage
architects
the
making
of
windows
will
supply
ventilation
to
indian
huts
but
the
form
of
the
hut
we
must
bear
in
mind
is
made
to
suit
the
locality
in
which
we
find
it
apache
hogan
the
white
mountain
apache
builds
a
shack
figs
and
which
is
practically
the
same
as
that
already
described
and
shown
in
figs
and
the
difference
being
that
the
apache
shack
is
not
covered
with
birch
bark
a
material
peculiar
to
the
north
but
the
apache
uses
a
thatch
of
the
rank
grass
to
be
found
where
his
shacks
are
located
however
the
white
mountain
apache
has
become
so
degenerate
and
so
lost
to
the
true
sense
of
dignity
as
a
savage
that
he
stoops
to
use
with
which

san

the
san

apache
indians
build
a
hut
by
making
a
framework
of
small
saplings
bent
in
arches
as
the
boys
did
in
kentucky
when
the
writer
was
himself
a
lad
and
as
shown
in
fig
the
ends
of
the
pole
are
sunk
into
the
ground
in
the
form
of
a
circle
while
their
tips
are
bent
over
and
bound
together
thus
forming
a
series
of
loops
which
overlap
each
other
and
give
stability
and
support
to
the
principal
loops
which
run
from
the
ground
to
the
top
of
the
dome
the
indians
thatch
these
huts
with
arranged
in
overlapping
rows

much
farther
north
i
have
seen
the
chippewa
indians
build
a

in
practically
the
same
manner
as
the
san
carlos
apache
but
the
chippewas
covered
their
frame
with
layers
of
birch
bark
held
in
place
by
ropes
stretched
over
it
as
shown
in
fig
the
door
to
their
huts
consisted
of
a
blanket
portière
in
the
same
locality
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
procure
such
large
strips
of
birch
bark
but
the
frame
is
a
good
one
to
be
used
in
many
localities
and
like
all
other
frames
it
can
be
covered
with
the
material
at
hand
it
may
be
shingled
with
smaller
pieces
of
bark
covered
with
brush
and
thatched
with
browse

with
hay

with

fig
which
may
be
adapted
for
our
use
in
almost
any
section
of
the
country
it
can
be
made
warm
and
tight
for
the
far
north
and
cool
and
airy
for
the
arid
regions
of
the
southwest
the
framework
as
you
may
see
by
referring
to
the
diagram
is
similar
to
the
we
men
made
when
we
were
boys
and
which
are
described
in
the
american
boy
handy
book
consisting
of
four
upright
posts
supporting
in
their
crotches
two
crosspieces
over
which
a
flat
roof
is
made
by
placing
poles
across
but
the
sides
of
this
shack
are
not
upright
but
made
by
resting
leaning
poles
against
the
eaves
white
man
walls
the
principal
difference
between
a
white
man
architecture
and
the
indian
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
white
man
with
brick
stone
or
frame
house
in
his
mind
is
possessed
of
a
desire
to
build
perpendicular
walls
walls
which
are
hard
to
thatch
and
difficult
to
cover
with
turf
especially
in
the
far
north
where
there
is
no
true
sod
such
as
we
understand
in
the
middle
country
where
our
grass
grows
thickly
with
interlacing
roots
boys
will
do
well
to
remember
this
and
imitate
the
indian
in
making
slanting
walls
for
their
shacks
shanties
and
shelters
in
the
woods
if
they
have
boards
or
stone
or
brick
or
logs
with
which
to
build
they
may
with
propriety
use
a
perpendicular
wall

the
ones
here
given
most
of
which
were
originally
made
for
caspar
whitney
while
he
was
editor
of
the

the

as
here
given
is
my
own
design

invention

it
is
supposed
to
be
shingled
with
birch
bark
but
as
is
the
case
with
all
these
camps
other
bark
may
be
substituted
for
the
birch
and
if
no
bark
is
within
reach
and
you
are
near
enough

an
excellent
substitute

not

than
half
as

you
will
note
that
the

cut
round
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
and
a
slit
is
made
connecting
the
two
cuts
as
already
described

that
the

may
be
peeled
off
by
running
a
blunt
instrument

whittled
to
the
shape
of
a

it
is

how
to

it
up

how
to
bind
the

viii
indian
communal
houses
when
the
french
communists
were
raising
cain
in
europe
they
doubtless
thought
their
idea
was
practically
new
but
thousands
of
years
before
they
bore
the
red
banner
through
the
streets
of
paris
the
american
indians
were
living
quiet
and
peaceful
communal
lives
on
this
continent
when
i
use
the
words
and
i
of
course
mean
as
regards
their
own
particular
commune
and
not
taking
into
account
their
attitude
toward
their
neighbors
the
pueblo
indians
built
themselves
adobe
communal
houses
the
nez
percés
built
themselves
houses
of
sticks
and
dry
grass
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
sometimes
containing
families
while
the
nechecolles
had
houses
two
hundred
and
feet
in
length
but
this
is
not
a
book
of
history
all
we
want
to
know
is
how
to
build
shacks
for
our
own
use
so
we
will
borrow
one
from
the
communal
home
of
the
iroquois
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
make
this
one
hundred
feet
long
as
the
iroquois
indians
did
we
can
make
a
diminutive
one
as
a
playhouse
for
our
children
a
one
as
a
camp
for
our
boy
scouts
or
a
one
for
a
party
of
campers
but
first
we
must
gather
a
number
of
long
flexible
saplings
and
plant
them
in
two
rows
with
their
butt
ends
in
the
ground
as
shown
in
fig
after
which
we
may
bend
their
upper
ends
so
that
they
will
overlap
each
other
and
form
arches
when
they
are
lashed
together
with
twine
if
we
have
it
or
with
wire
if
it
is
handy
but
if
we
are
real
woodsmen
we
will
bind
them
with
rope
made
of
fibres
of
bark
or
the
flexible
roots
which
we
find
in
the
forests
then
we
bind
horizontal
poles
or
rods
to
the
arches
placing
the
poles
about
a
foot
or
two
apart
according
to
the
material
with
which
we
are
to
shingle
it
we
make
a
simple
doorway
with
upright
posts
at
one
end
and
bind
the
horizontal
posts
on
as
we
did
at
the
sides
next
we
shingle
it
with
bark
or
with
strips
of
tar
paper
and
hold
the
shingles
in
place
by
binding
poles
upon
the
outside
as
shown
in
fig
a
hole
or
holes
are
left
in
the
roof
over
the
fireplaces
for
openings
for
the
smoke
to
escape
in
lieu
of
a
chimney
a
of
bark
is
fastened
at
its
lower
edge
by
pieces
of
twine
to
the
roof
so
as
to
shield
the
opening
this
should
be
movable
so
that
it
may
be
shifted
according
to
the
wind

easily
constructed

the

sticks
shown
in

with
sheets
of
tar
paper
in
place
of
the
birch
bark
usually
used
for
that
purpose
personally
i
do
not
like
tar
paper
it
seems
to
rob
the
camp
of
a
true
flavor
of
the
woods
it
knocks
the
sentiment
out
of
it
and
except
to
sailors
the
odor
of
the
tar
is
not
nearly
as
delightful
as
that
of
the
fragrant
balsam
boughs
nevertheless
tar
paper
is
now
used
in
all
the
lumber
camps
and
is
spreading
farther
and
farther
into
the
woods
as
the
birch
bark
becomes
scarce
and
the
are
improved
when
one
can
enter
the
woods
with
an
automobile
you
must
expect
to
find
tar
paper
camps
because
the
paper
is
easily
transported
easily
handled
and
easily
applied
for
the
purpose
of
the

be
reproduced
by
tacking

to

if
you
make

do
paint
it

off

before
we
proceed
any
further
it
may
be
best
to
give
the
plan
of
a
workshop
a
camp
an
outhouse
or
a
shed
to
be
made
of
sawed
lumber
the
framework
of
which
is
made
of
what
is
known
as
that
is
pieces
of
lumber
two
inches
thick
by
four
inches
wide
the
plans
used
here
are
from
my
book
the
jack
of
all
trades
but
the
dimensions
may
be
altered
to
suit
your
convenience
the
sills
which
are
four
inches
by
four
inches
are
also
supposed
to
be
made
by
nailing
two
together
first
stake
out
your
foundation
and
see
that
the
corners
are
square
that
is
at
right
angles
and
test
this
with
a
tape
or
ruler
by
measuring
six
feet
one
way
and
eight
feet
the
other
from
a
corner
along
the
proposed
sides
of
the
house
marking
these
points
if
a
rod
will
reach
exactly
across
from
point
to
point
the
corner
is
square
and
you
may
dig
your
the
foundation
you
may
use
a
foundation
of
stones
or
a
series
of
stone
piles
but
if
you
use
stones
and
expect
your
house
to
remain
plumb
where
the
winters
are
severe
you
must
dig
holes
for
them
at
least
three
feet
deep
in
order
to
go
below
the
fill
these
holes
with
broken
stone
on
top
of
which
you
can
make
your
pile
of
stones
to
act
as
support
for
the
sills
but
the
simplest
method
is
to
use
posts
of
locust
cedar
or
chestnut
or
if
this
is
too
much
trouble
pack
the
dirt
tightly
drain
it
well
by
making
it
slope
away
from
the
house
in
every
direction
and
lay
your
foundation
sills
on
the
level
earth
in
that
case
you
had
better
use
chestnut
wood
for
the
sills
spruce
will
rot
very
quickly
in
contact
with
the
damp
earth
and
pine
will
not
last
long
under
the
same
circumstances
all
through
certain
sections
of
this
country
there
are
hundreds
of
humble
dwellings
built
upon
mudsills
in
other
words
with
no
foundation
or
floor
but
the
bare
ground
we
will
suppose
that
you
have
secured
some
posts
about
two
feet
six
inches
long
with
good
flat
ends
the
better
material
you
can
obtain
the
trimmer
and
better
will
be
the
appearance
of
your
house
but
a
house
which
will
protect
you
and
your
tools
may
be
made
of
the
roughest
lumber
the
plans
here
drawn
will
answer
for
the
rough
or
fine
material
but
we
suppose
that
medium
material
is
to
be
used
it
will
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
reader
is
able
to
procure
enough
timber
to
supply
studs
ribs
purlins
rafters
beams
and
posts
for
the
frame
shown
in
fig
two
pieces
of
timber
each
fifteen
feet
long
should
be
made
for
sills
by
nailing
together
add
to
this
some
boarding
or
even
rough
boards
for
sides
and
roof
some
enthusiasm
and
good
american
pluck
and
the
shop
is
almost
as
good
as
built
first
lay
the
foundation
eight
by
fifteen
feet
and
then
you
may
proceed
to
dig
your
the
outside
of
the
posts
should
be
flush
or
even
with
the
outside
edges
of
the
sills
and
end
beams
of
the
house
as
shown
in
the
diagram
if
there
are
four
posts
on
each
of
the
long
sides
they
should
be
equal
distances
apart
dig
the
holes
three
feet
deep
allowing
six
inches
of
the
posts
to
protrude
above
ground
if
you
drive
two
stakes
a
short
distance
beyond
the
foundation
in
line
with
your
foundation
lines
and
run
a
string
from
the
top
of
one
stake
to
the
top
of
the
other
you
can
without
much
trouble
get
it
upon
a
perfect
level
by
testing
it
and
adjusting
until
the
string
represents
the
level
for
your
sill
when
this
is
done
set
your
posts
to
correspond
to
the
level
of
the
string
then
place
your
sill
on
top
of
the
posts
and
test
that
with
your
level
if
found
to
be
correct
fill
in
the
dirt
around
the
posts
and
pack
it
firmly
then
spike
your
sill
to
the
posts

go
through
the
same
operation

the
first
difficult
work
is
now
done
and
with
the
exception
of
the
roof
the
rest
only
needs
ordinary
care
it
is
supposed
that
you
have
already
sawed
off
and
prepared
about
nine

them
in

you
may
now
neatly
floor
the

with
boards
these
boards
must
be
laid
lengthwise
with
the
building
and
crosswise
with
the
beams
when
this
is
finished
you
will
have
a
beautiful
platform
on
which
to
work
where
you
will
be
in
no
danger
of
losing
your
tools
and
you
may
use
the
floor
as
a
table
on
which
to
measure
and
plan
the
sides
and
roof
ridge

it
is
a
good
idea
to
make
your
ridge
plank
and
rafters
while
the
floor
is
clear

lay
out

on
the

allow
two
inches
at
the
top
for
the
ridge
plank
at

two
by

for
the
end

you
then
have
a
pattern
for
each
rafter
with
a
plumb
edge
at
and
a
bird
mouth
at
the
plumb
edge
must
be
parallel
with

the
two
jaws
of
the
bird
mouth
parallel
with
and
respectively
make
six
rafters
of
and
one
ridge
plank
the
purlins
and
collar
can
be
made
and
fitted
after
the
roof
is
raised
set
your
roof
timber
carefully
to
one
side
and
clear
the
floor
for
the
studs
ribs
and
plates
first
prepare
the
end
posts
and
make
them
of
each
post
is
of
two
pieces
there
will
be
four
outside
pieces
each
five
feet
eight
inches
in
length
which
rest
on
the
end
beams
and
four
inside
pieces
each
six
feet
in
length
this
allows
two
inches
at
the
top
for
the
ends
of
the
end
plates
to
rest
upon
examine
the
corner
posts
and
you
will
see
that
the
outside
rests
upon
the
top
side
of
the
end
beam
and
the
rests
directly
upon
said
you
will
also
observe
that
the
inside
rests
directly
upon
the
sill
which
would
make
the
former
four
inches
longer
than
the
outside
piece
if
it
is
extended
to
the
but
you
will
also
notice
that
there
is
a
notch
in
the
end
plate
for
the
outside
corner
piece
to
fit
in
and
that
the
end
of
the
end
plate
fits
on
top
the
inside
piece
of
the
corner
posts
taking
off
two
inches
which
makes
the
inside
piece
just
six
feet
long
this
is
a
very
simple
arrangement
as
may
be
seen
by
examining
the
diagram
besides
the
corner
posts
each
of
which
we
have
seen
is
made
of
two
pieces
of
there
are
four
studs
for
the
front
side
each
six
feet
two
inches
long
the
short
studs
shown
in
the
diagram
on
the
rear
side
are
unnecessary
and
are
only
shown
so
that
they
may
be
put
in
as
convenient
attachments
for
shelves
and
tool
racks
the
first
stud
on
the
front
is
placed
two
feet
from
the
corner
post
and
the
second
one
about
six
feet
six
inches
from
the
first
to
allow
a
space
for
a
window
the
next
two
studs
form
the
and
must
be
far
enough
from
the
corner
to
allow
the
door
to
open
and
swing
out
of
the
way
if
you
make
your
door
two
and
one
half
feet
wide
a
good
size
you
may
set
your
last
stud
two
feet
from
the
corner
post
and
leave
a
space
of
two
feet
six
inches
for
the
doorway
now
mark
off
on
the
floor
the
places
where
the
studs
will
come
and
cut
out
the
flooring
at
these
points
to
allow
the
ends
of
the
studs
to
enter
and
rest
on
the
sill
next
make
four
ribs
one
long
one
to
go
beneath
the
window
one
short
one
to
fit
between
the
corner
post
and
the
door
stud
not
shown
in
diagram
another
to
fit
between
the
door
stud
and
window
stud
and
another
to
fit
between
the
window
stud
and
the
first
corner
post
the
nearest
corner
in
the
diagram
next
make
your
exactly
fifteen
feet
long
fit
the
frame
together
on
the
floor
and
nail
the
pieces
together
the
ribs
in
place
get
some
help
and
raise
the
whole
side
frame
and
slip
the
ends
of
the
studs
into
their
respective
slots
make
the
end
posts
plumb
and
hold
them
in
place
temporarily
by
a
board
one
end
of
which
is
nailed
to
the
top
end
of
the
post
and
the
other
to
the
end
beam
such
a
diagonal
board
at
each
end
will
hold
the
side
in
place
until
the
opposite
side
is
raised
and
similarly
supported
it
is
now
a
simple
thing
to
slip
the
end
plates
in
place
under
the
until
their
outside
edges
are
even
with
the
outside
of
the
corner
posts
a
long
wire
nail
driven
through
the
and
end
plates
down
into
the
posts
at
each
corner
will
hold
them
securely
a
rib
between
the
two
nearest
end
posts
and
make
two
window
studs
and
three
ribs
for
the
opposite
end
the
framing
now
only
needs
the
roof
timbers
to
complete
the
skeleton
of
your
shop
across
from
to
lay
some
loose
boards
for
a
platform
and
standing
on
these
boards
let
your
assistant
lift
one
end
of
the
ridge
plank
while
with
one
nail
to
each
rafter
you
fasten
the
two
end
rafters
onto
the
ridge
plank
fit
the
jaws
of
the
bird
mouth
over
the
ends
of
the
and
hold
them
temporarily
in
place
with
a
stay
lath
that
is
a
piece
of
board
temporarily
nailed
to
rafter
and
end
plate
the
other
end
of
the
ridge
is
now
resting
on
the
platform
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
this
may
be
lifted
up
for
the
single
nails
will
allow
movement
the
rafters
are
nailed
in
place
with
one
nail
each
and
a
stay
lath
fastened
on
to
hold
them
in
place
test
the
ends
with
your
and
when
they
are
found
to
be
correct
nail
all
the
rafters
securely
in
place
and
stiffen
the
centre
pair
with
a
piece
called
a
collar
add
four
purlins
set
at
right
angles
to
the
rafters
and
take
off
your
hat
and
give
three
cheers
and
do
not
forget
to
nail
a
green
bough
to
your
roof
tree
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
and
custom
the
sides
of
the
house
may
be
covered
with
oilcloth
tin
tar
paper
or
the
cheapest
sort
of
lumber
and
the
house
may
be
roofed
with
the
same
material
but
if
you
can
secure
good
lumber
use
thirteen
by
seven
eighths
by
nine
and
one
quarter
inch
one
side
planed
so
that
it
may
be
painted
you
can
make
two
sideboards
out
of
each
piece
six
feet
six
inches
in
length
nail
the
sides
on
running
the
boards
vertically
leaving
openings
for
windows
and
doors
at
the
proper
places
if
you
have
made
a
triangular
edge
to
your
ridge
board
it
will
add
to
the
finish
and
the
roof
may
be
neatly
and
tightly
laid
with
the
upper
edge
of
one
side
protruding
a
couple
of
inches
over
the
opposite
side
and
thus
protecting
the
joint
from
rain
additional
security
is
gained
by
nailing
what
are
called
picket
strips
seven
eighths
by
one
and
three
quarter
inches
over
each
place
where
the
planks
join
or
the
roof
may
be
covered
with
sheathing
boards
and
shingles
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
give
the
many
details
such
as
the
manufacture
of
the
door
and
the
arrangements
of
the
windows
as
these
small
problems
can
be
easily
solved
by
examining
doors
and
windows
of
similar
structures
xi
a
sod
house
for
the

the
difference
between
this
sod
house
and
the
ones
used
in
the
arid
regions
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
sod
will
be
growing
on
the
sod
house
which
is
intended
for
and
is
an
ornamental
building
for
the

possibly
one
might
say
that
the
sod
house
is
an
effete
product
of
civilization
where
utility
is
sacrificed
to
display
but
it
is
pretty
and
beauty
is
always
worth
while
besides
which
the
same
plans
may
be
used
in
building
a
real
adobe
and
practically
are
used
in
some
of
the
desert
ranches
along
the
colorado
river
the
principal
difference
in
construction
between
the
one
shown
in
figs
and
and
the
one
in
fig
is
that
in
the
sod
house
the
sod
is
held
in

in
the

be
made
flat

covered
with

will
have
to
be
held
in
place
by
pegging
other
poles
along
the
eaves
as
shown
in
the
corner
of

this
will
keep
the
sod
from
sliding
off
the
roof

you
may
build
a
roof
after
the
manner
illustrated
by
fig
and

that
is
if
you
want
to
make
a
neat
workmanlike
house
but
any
of
the
ways
shown
by

will
answer
for
the
framework
of

must
necessarily
be

how
to
build
elevated
shacks
shanties
and
shelters
for
many
reasons
it
is
sometimes
necessary
or
advisable
to
have
one
camp
on
stilts
so
to
speak
especially
is
this
true
in
the
more
tropical
countries
where
noxious
serpents
and
insects
abound
a
simple
form
of
stilted
shack
is
shown
by
fig
to
build
this
shack
we
must
first
erect
an
elevated
platform
fig
this
is
made
by
setting
four
forked
sticks
of
equal
height
in
the
ground
and
any
height
from
the
ground
to
suit
the
ideas
of
the
camp
builder
if
for
some
reason
the
uprights
are
wabbly
the
frame
may
be
stiffened
by
lashing
diagonal
cross
sticks
to
the
frame
after
you
have
erected
the
four
uprights
lay
two
poles
through
the
crotches
as
in
fig
and
make
a
platform
by
placing
other
poles
across
these
after
which
a
shelter
may
be
made
in
the
form
of
an
open
adirondack
camp
or
any
of
the
forms
previously
described
fig
shows
the
framework
for
the
open
camp
of
adirondack
style
with
the
uprights
lashed
to
the
side
bars
if
you
have
nails
of
course
you
can
nail
these
together
but
these
plans
are
made
on
the
assumption
that
you
have
no
nails
for
that
purpose
which
will
probably
be
true

now
almost
obsolete

is
a

the
ground
is
marshy
damp
and
unfit
to

upon
as
you
will
see
by
the

fig
the
house
is
built
upon
a
platform
similar
to
the
one
last
described
in
this
instance
however
the
shelter
itself
is
formed
by
a
series
of
arches
similar
to
the
iroquois

the
uprights

the
two
sides

their
ends
bent
over

of
a
tin
pan

the

have
all
been
halved

them

for

but
a
real
bog
ken
is
one
that
is
built
over
boggy
or
marshy
places
too
soft
to
support
an
ordinary
structure
to
overcome
this
difficulty
required
considerable
study
and
experiment
but
at
length
the
author
hit
upon
a
simple
plan
which
has
proved
effective
if
you
wish
to
build
a
duck
hunter
camp
on
the
soft
meadows
or
for
any
other
reason
you
desire
a
camp
on
treacherous
boggy
ground
you
may
build
one
by
first
making
a
thick
mattress
of
twigs
and
sticks
as
shown
by
fig
this
mattress
acts
on
the
principle
of
a
and
prevents
your
house
from
sinking
by
distributing
the
weight
equally
over
a
wide
surface
the
mattress
should
be
carefully
made
of
sticks
having
their
branches
trimmed
off
sufficiently
to
allow
them
to
lie
in
regular
courses
as
in
the
diagram
the
first
course
should
be
laid
one
way
and
the
next
course
at
right
angles
to
the
first
and
so
on
until
the
mattress
is
sufficiently
thick
for
the
purpose
standing
on
the
mattress
it
will
be
an
easy
matter
with
your
hands
to
force
the
sharpened
ends
of
your
upright
posts
and
down
into
the
yielding
mud
but
be
careful
not
to
push
them
too
far
because
in
some
of
these
marshes
the
mud
is
practically
bottomless
it
is
only
necessary
for
the
supports
to
sink
in
the
mud
far
enough
to
make
them
stand
upright

the

step
is
to

of

a

of
rods

between

them

press
them
down

they
fit
snugly

poles
and
there
nail
them
fast
to
the
uprights
as
shown
in

after
which
to
further
bind
them
you
may
nail
a
diagonal
from
to
and
to
but
this
may
not
be
necessary
when
you
have
proceeded
thus
far
you
may
erect
a
framework

shown

flooring
the
crosspieces

if

my
experience
with
this
sort
of
work
leads
me
to
advise
the
use
of
piles
upon
which
to
build
in
place
of
piers
of
stones
where
i
have
used
such
piers
upon
small
inland
lakes
the
tremendous
push
of
the
freezing
ice
has
upset
them
whereas
the
ice
seems
to
slide
around
the
piles
without
pushing
them
over
the
real
danger
with
piles
lies
in
the
fact
that
if
the
water
rises
after
the
ice
has
frozen
around
the
uprights
the
water
will
lift
the
ice
up
and
the
ice
will
sometimes
pull
the
piles
out
of
the
bottom
like
a
dentist
pulls
teeth
nevertheless
piles
are
much
better
for
a
foundation
for
a
camp
or
pier
than
any
crib
of
rocks
and
that
is
the
reason
i
have
shown
the
cribs
in
figs
and
made
so
as
to
rest
upon
the
bottom
supposedly
below
the

if
there
is

in
the

we

at
the
spot
where
you
are
to
erect
the

begin
by
laying
out
on

what
we
call
the
kite

first
take
three
of
the

two
of
the

and
placing
them
on
a

stretch
of

arrange
them
in

of
a
parallelogram
put
for
the
top
rail
at
the
top
of
the
parallelogram
and
for
the
bottom
of
the
parallelogram
and
let
them
rest
upon
the
sides
and
but
put
under
the
sides
and
in
order
to
bind
these
together
securely
the
ends
of
all
the
sticks
must
be
allowed
to
project
a
few
inches
should
be
far
enough
below
to
give
the
proper
height
for
a
railing
around
the
platform
the
platform
itself
rests
upon
forms
the
top
railing
to
the
fence
around
it
now
take
two
of
your
poles
and
place
them
diagonally
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
parallelogram
with
the
small
ends
of
the
poles
lying
over
the
ends
of
and
the
butt
ends
of
the
poles
extending
beyond
as
in
fig
lash
these
poles
securely
in
place
where
the
poles
cross
each
other
in
the
or
centre
it
is
best
to
flatten
them
some
by
scoring
and
hewing
with
a
hatchet
but
care
must
be
taken
not
to
weaken
them
by
scoring
too
deep
next
take
your

rope
double
it
run
the

down
under

bring
it
up

which
occasionally
visit

since
i
published
the

plans
of

many
people
have
adopted
the
idea
and
built
quite
expensive
structures
in
the
boughs
of
the
trees
probably
all
these
buildings
are
intact
at
the
present
writing
the
boys
at
lynn
built
a
very
substantial
house
in
the
trees
and
the
truant
officer
claimed
that
the
lads
hid
away
there
so
that
they
could
play
hookey
from
school
but
if
this
is
true
and
there
seems
to
be
some
doubt
about
it
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
fault
was
probably
with
and
not
the
boys
for
boys
who
have
ingenuity
and
grit
enough
to
build
a
substantial
house
in
a
tree
can
not
be
bad
boys
industry
skill
and
laborious
work
are
not
the
attributes
of
the
bad
boy
some
new
york
city
boys
built
a
house
in
the
trees
at
one
hundred
and
street
but
here
the
police
interfered
claiming
that
it
was
against
a
city
ordinance
to
build
houses
in
and
maybe
it
is
but
fortunately
for
the
boys
there
are
other
trees
which
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
there
is

was
recently

interesting

avenue

a
house
so
commodious
that
it
was
capable
of
accommodating

many
as
fifteen
people
but
it
was
not
as
pretty

attractive
a
as
the
one
located
at
the
foot
of
mount
tamalpais
in

which
is

while
down
in

another
man
who
feared

mosquitoes

objected
to
wild
beasts

snakes
built
himself
a
house
on

an
seventy

quite
a

completely
hides

retreat
from
the
pests
enumerated
it
might
not
be
so
safe
from
lightning
in
one
of
those
violent
tropical
storms
but
it
is
probably
as
safe
as
any
house
in
that
country
for
one
must
take
chances
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
house
one
dwells
in

and
savage
men
all
over
the
world
for
thousands
of
years
have
built
dwellings
in

tops
in
the
philippines
many
natives
live
in

the
kinnikars
of
travancore
india
are
said
to
live
in
houses
built
in
the
trees
but
in
new
guinea
it
seems
that
such
houses
are
only
provided
for
the
girls
and
every
night
the
dusky
lassies
are
sent
to
bed
in
shacks
perched
in
the
tree
tops

to
make
safety
doubly
safe

watchful
parents
take
away
the
ladders
and
their
daughters
can
not
reach
the
ground
until
the
ladders
are
replaced

morning
the
most
important
thing
about
all
this
is
that
a
is
always
a
source
of
delight
to
the
boys
and
young
people
and
furthermore
the
boys
have
over
and
over
again
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
author
that
they
themselves
are
perfectly
competent
to
build
these
shacks
and
not
only
to
build
them
but
to
avoid
accidents
and
serious
falls
while

caches
the
difference
between
tomahawk
shacks
and
axe
houses
reminds
me
of
the
difference
between
the
ileum
and
the
jejunum
of
which
my
classmate
once
said
there
is
no
way
of
telling
the
beginning
of
one
or
the
ending
of
by
the
hue
of
the
latter
it
must
be
confessed
that
some
of
the
shacks
described
in
the
preceding
pages
are
rather
stout
and
massive
to
be
classed
as
tomahawk
shelters
but
as
indicated
by
my
reference
to
physiology
this
is
not
the
fault
the
trouble
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
nature
abhors
the
arbitrary
division
line
which
man
loves
to
make
for
his
own
convenience
the
tomahawk
shacks
gradually
evolve
into
axe
camps
and
houses
and
there
is
no
telling
the
beginning
of
one
and
the
end
of
hence
when
i
say
that
all
the
previous
shacks
sheds
shelters
and
shanties
are
fashioned
with
a
hatchet
the
statement
must
be
accepted
as
true
only
so
far
as
possible
to
build
them
without
an
axe
but
in
looking
over
the
diagram
it
is
evident
at
a
glance
that
the
logs
are
growing
so
thick
that
the
necessity
of
the
woodman
axe
is
more
and
more
apparent
nevertheless
the
accompanying
caches
have
been
classed
with
the
tomahawk
group
and
we
will
allow
them
to
remain
there
wherever
man
travels
in
the
wilderness
he
finds
it
necessary
to
cache
that
is
hide
or
secure
some
of
his
goods
or
provisions
the
security
of
these

these

it

there

how
to
use
an
axe
the
old
backwoodsmen
were
as
expert
with
their
axes
as
they
were
with
their
rifles
and
they
were
just
as
careful
in
the
selection
of
these
tools
as
they
were
in
the
selection
of
their
arms
many
a
time
i
have
seen
them
pick
up
a
store
axe
sight
along
the
handle
and
then
cast
it
contemptuously
aside
they
demanded
of
their
axes
that
the
cutting
edge
should
be
exactly
in
line
with
the
point
in
the
centre
of
the
butt
end
of
the
handle
they
also
kept
their
axes
so
sharp
that
they
could
whittle
with
them
like
one
can
with
a
good
furthermore
they
allowed
but
themselves
to
use
their
own
particular
axe
in
my
log
house
in
the
mountains
of
pike
county
i
have
a
table
fashioned
entirely
with
an
axe
even
the
ends
of
the
boards
which
form
the
top
of
the
table
were
cut
off
by
siley
rosencranz
with
his
trusty
axe
because
he
had
no
saw
both
general
grant
and
abraham
lincoln
were
expert
axemen
and
probably
a
number
of
other
presidents
were
also
skilful
in
the
use
of
this
tool
but
it
is
not
expected
that
the
modern
vacation
pioneer
shall
be
an
expert
consequently
a
few
simple
rules
and
suggestions
will
be
here
given
to
guide
the
amateur
and
he
must
depend
upon
his
own
judgment
and
common
sense
to
work
out
the
minor
problems
which
will
beset
him
in
the
use
of
this
tool
dangers
all
edged
tools
are
dangerous
when
in
the
hands
of
chumps
dangerous
to
themselves
and
to
any
one
else
who
is
near
them
for
instance
only
a
chump
will
use
an
axe
when
its
head
is
loose
and
is
in
danger
of
flying
off
the
handle
only
a
chump
will
use
his
axe
to
cut
roots
or
sticks
lying
flat
on
the
ground
where
he
is
liable
to
strike
stones
and
other
objects
and
take
the
edge
off
the
blade
only
a
chump
will
leave
an
axe
lying
around
on
the
ground
for
people
to
stumble
over
if
there
is
a
stump
handy
at
your
camp
and
you
are
through
using
the
axe
strike
the
blade
into
the
top
of
the
stump
and
leave
the
axe
sticking
there
where
it
will
be
safe
from
injury
remember
before
chopping
down
a
tree
or
before
using
the
axe
at
all
to
see
that
there
is
enough
space
above
and
around
you
to
enable
you
to
swing
the
axe
clear
fig
without
the
danger
of
striking
bushes
or
overhanging
branches
which
may
deflect
the
blade
and
cause
accidents
more
or
less
serious
do
not
stand
behind
a
tree
as
it
falls
fig
for
the
boughs

strike
those
of
a
standing
tree
causing
the
butt
to
shoot
back
or
kick
and
many
a
woodsman
has
lost
his
life
from
the
kick
of
a
falling
tree
before
chopping
a
tree
down
select
the
place
where
it
is
to
fall
a
place
where
it
will
not
be
liable
to
lodge
in
another
tree
on
its

not
try
to
fell

against
the

cut
a

it
to

avoid
pinching
your

you
discover
that
the

cut
a

some
inches
above
your

split
off
the
piece
between
the
two
notches

again
make
the
notch

split
off
the
piece

until
you
make
room
for
the
axe
to
continue
your
chopping
when

is
finished
begin
another
one
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
tree
a
little
higher

the
first
one

when
the
wood
between
the
two
notches
becomes
too
small
to
support
the
weight
of
the
tree
the
top
of

it
is
sometimes

by

there
was
a
standing
close
to
my
log
house
and
leaning
toward
the
building
under
ordinary
circumstances
felling
this
tree
would
cause
it
to
strike
the
house
with
all
the
weight
of
its
trunk
and
branches
when
i
told
siley
rosencranz
i
wanted
that
tree
cut
down
he
sighted
up
the
tree
took
a
chew
of
tobacco
and
walked
away
for
several
days
he
went
through
the
same
performance
until
at
last
one
day
he
brought
out
his
trusty
axe
and
made
the
chips
fly
soon
the
chestnut
was
lying
prone
on
the
ground
from
the
house
what
this
old
backwoodsman
did
was
to
wait
until
a
strong
wind
had
sprung
up
blowing
in
the
direction
that
he
wanted
the
tree
to
fall
and
his
skilful
chopping
with
the
aid
of
the
wind
placed
the
tree
exactly
where
he
wished
it
fig

how
to
make
the
cuts
on
a
standing

in

also
some
logs
are
usually
split
by
the
use
of
wedges
but
it
is
possible
to
split
them
by
the
use
of
two
axes
fig
shows
both
methods
to
split
with
the
axe
strike
it
smartly
into
the
wood
at
the
small
end
so
as
to
start
a
crack
then
sink
the
axe
in
the
crack
next
take
the
second
axe
and
strike
it
in
line
with
the
first
one
at
if
this
is
done
properly
it
should
open
the
crack
wide
enough
to
release
the
first
axe
without
trouble
which
may
then
be
struck
in
the
log
at
in
this
manner
it
is
possible
to
split
a
piece
of
timber
without
the
use
of
wedges
the
first
axe
should
be
struck
in
at
the
smaller
or
top
end
of
the
log
to
split
a
log
with
wedges
take
your
axe
in
your
left
hand
and
a
club
in
your
right
hand
and
by
hammering
the
head
of
your
axe
with
the
club
drive
the
blade
into
the
small
end
of
the
log
far
enough
to
make
a
crack
deep
enough
to
hold
the
thin
edge
of
your
wedges
make
this
crack
all
the
way
across
the
end
of
the
log
as
in
fig
put
two
wedges
in
the
end
of
the
log
as
in
the
diagram
and
drive
them
until
the
wood
begins
to
split
and
crack
along
the
sides
of
the
log
then
follow
up
this
crack
with
other
wedges
as
shown
at
and
until
the
log
is
split
in
half
while
ordinary
wood
splits
easily
enough
with
the
grain
it
is
very
difficult
to
drive
an
axe
through
the
wood
at
right
angles
to
the
grain
as
shown
by
diagram
to
the
left
fig
hence
if
the
amateur
be
chopping
wood
if
he
will
strike
a
slanting
blow
like
the
one
to
the
right
in
fig
he
will
discover
that
the
blade
of
his
axe
will
enter
the
wood
whereas
in
the
first
position
where
he
strikes
the
grain
at
right
angles
it
will
only
make
a
dent
in
the
wood
and
bounce
the
axe
back
but
in
striking
a
diagonal
blow
he
must
use
care
not
to
slant
his
axe
too
far
or
the
blade
of
the
axe
may
only
scoop
out
a
shallow
chip
and
swing
around
seriously
injuring
the
axeman
or
some
one
else
if
it
is
desired
to
cut
off
the
limb
of
a
tree
do
not
disfigure
the
tree
by
tearing
the
bark
down
trees
are
becoming
too
scarce
for
us
to
injure
them
unnecessarily
if
you
cut
part
way
through
the
limb
on
the
see
the
diagram
fig
and
then
cut
partly
through
from
the
top
side
the
limb
will
fall
off
without
tearing
the
bark
down
the
trunk
but
if
you
cut
only
from
the
top
see
diagram
fig
sooner
or
later
the
weight
of
the
limb
will
tear
it
off
and
make
an
ugly
wound
down
the
front
of
the
tree
which
in
time
decays
makes
a
hollow
and
ultimately
destroys
the
tree
a
neatly
cut
branch
on
the
other
hand
when
the
stub
has
been
sheared
off
close
to
the
bark
will
heal
up
leaving
only
an
on
the
bark
to
tell
where
the
limb
once
grew
if
it
is
desired
to
chop
a
log
up
into
shorter
pieces
remember
to
stand
on
the
log
to
do
your
chopping
as
in
fig
this
will
do
away
with
the
necessity
of
rolling
the
log
over
when
you
want
to
chop
on
the
other
side
do
not
forget
to
make
the
kerf
or
notch
the
same
as
in
other
words
the
distance
across
the
notch
should
equal
the
diameter
of
the
log
if
you
start
with
too
narrow
a
kerf
or
notch
before
you
finish
you
will
be
compelled
to
widen

puncheon

with
which
they
floored
their
cabins
before
the
advent

milled

perhaps
it

for

and
snap
it
from

that

may
be

level
the
expert
axeman
will
do
this
by
what
he
calls

it
might
be
well
to
say
here
that
if
you
select
for
puncheons
wood
with
a
straight
grain
and
wood
that
will
split
easily
you
will
simplify
your
task
but
even
mean
stubborn
wood
may
be
flattened
by
scoring
and
hewing
quoting
from
horace
kephart
excellent
book
on
woodcraft
an
experienced
man
can
tell
a
log
by
merely
scanning
the
bark
if
the
ridges
and
furrows
of
the
bark
run
straight
up
and
down
the
wood
will
have
a
corresponding
straight
grain
but
if
they
are
spiral
the
wood
will
split
waney
or
not
at
all
waney
is
a
good
word
almost
as
good
as
sensiation
so
when
you
try
to
quarter
a
log
with
which
to
chink
your
cabin
or
log
house
do
select
a
waney
log
to
quarter
a
log
split
it
as
shown
in

and
split
it
along
the
dotted
lines
shown
in
the
end

in
the

woods
the
woodsmen
are
adepts
in
making
shakes
splits
clapboards
or
shingles
by
the
use
of
only
an
axe
and
splitting
them
out
of
the
billets
of
wood
from
four
to
six
feet
long
the
core
of
the
log
fig
is
first
cut
out
and
then
the
pieces
are
split
out
having
edges
as
shown
by
the
lines
marked
on
fig
they
also
split
out
boards
after
the
manner
shown
by
fig
in
making
either
the
boards
or
the
shakes
if
it
is
found
that
the
wood
splinters
down
into
the
body
of
the
log
too
far
or
into
the
board
or
shake
too
far
you
must
commence
at
the
other
end
of
the
billet
or
log
and
split
it
up
to
meet
the
first
split
or
take
hold
of
the
split
or
board
with
your
hands
and
deftly
tear
it
from
the
log
an
art
which
only
experience
can
teach

have
seen
houses
composed
of
nothing
but
a
framework
with
sides
and
roof
shingled
over
with
these
splits
in
the
west
they
call
these
shake
cabins
it
may
be
wise
before
we
close
this
axeman
talk
to
caution
the
reader
against
chopping
firewood
by
resting
one
end
of
the
stick
to
be
cut
on
a
log
and
the
other
end
on
the
ground
as
shown
in
fig
and
then
striking
this
stick
a
sharp
blow
with
the
axe
in
the
middle
the
effect
of
this
often
is
to
send
the
broken
piece
or
fragment
gyrating
through
the
air
as
is
shown
by
the
dotted
lines
and
many
a
woodchopper
has
lost
an
eye
from
a
blow
inflicted
by
one
of
these
flying
pieces
indeed
i
have
had
some
of
my
friends
meet
with
this
serious
and
painful
accident
from
the
same
cause
and
i
have
seen
men
in
the
lumber
fields
who
have
been
blinded
in
a
similar
manner
there
are
two
sorts
of
axes
in
general
use
among
the
lumbermen
but
the
axe
appears
to
be
the
most
popular
among
lumberjacks
my
readers
however
are
not
lumberjacks
but
campers
and
a
axe
is
a
nuisance
around
camps
it
is
always
dangerous
and
even
when
one
blade
is
sunk
into
the
tree
the
other
blade
is
sticking
out
a
menace
to
everybody
and
everything
that
comes
near
it
but
the
real
reliable
axe
is
the
one
that
is
exceedingly
useful
in
a
camp
around
a
country
place
or
a
farm
i
even
have
one
now
in
my
studio
closet
here
in
the
city
of
new
york
but
i
keep
it
more
for
sentiment
sake
than
for
any
real
use
it
may
be
to
me

the
stefansson
sod
shack
now
that
we
know
how
to
wield
the
axe
we
can
begin
on
more
ambitious
structures
than
those
preceding
we
may
now
build
camps
in
which
we
use
logs
instead
of
poles
most
of
these
camps
are
intended
to
be
covered
with
sod
or
earth
and
are
nearly
related
to
the
old
prairie
dugout
the
sod
house
is
used
in
the
arctic
regions
because
it
is
warm
inside
and
it
is
used
in
the
arid
regions
because
it
is
cool
inside
you
will
note
that
the
principle
on
which
the
stefansson
is
constructed
fig
is
practically
the
same
as
that
of
the
pontiac
fig
the
stefansson
frame
however
is
made
of
larger
timbers
than
the
pontiac
because
it
not
only
must
support
a
roof
and
side
of
logs
and
sod
but
must
also
be
able
to
sustain
any
quantity
of
snow
first
erect
two
forked
upright
sticks
fig
and
then
steady
them
by
two
braces
next
lay
four
more
logs
or
sticks
for
the
with
their
butt
ends
on
the
and
their
small
ends
on
the
ground
as
in
fig
support
these
logs
by
a
number
of
small
uprights
as
many
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
the
uprights
may
have
forks
at
the
top
or
have
the
top
ends
cut
to
fit
in
notches
made
for
that
purpose
in
the
as
shown
by
fig
the
shortest
uprights
at
the
end
of
the
roof
should
be
forked
so
that
the
projecting
fork
will
tend
to
keep
the
roof
logs
from
sliding
down
the
roof
is
made
by
a
number
of
straight
rafters
placed
one
with
the
butt
in
front
next
with
the
butt
in
the
rear
alternately
so
that
they
will
fit
snugly
together
until
the
whole
roof
is
covered
the
sides
are
made
by
setting
a
number
of
sticks
in
a
trench
and
slanting
them
against
the
roof
both
sides
front
and
rear
of
the
building
should
project
six
inches
above
the
roof
in
order
to
hold
the
sod
and
dirt
and
keep
it
from
sliding
off

by

it
really
consists
of
scraggy
grass
thinly
distributed
on

consequently
we
must
secure
the
sod
by
having
the

project
a
little

in

the

that

built
himself
such

he
did
not
invent
them
he
borrowed
the
general
plan
from
the
natives

adapted
it
to
his
use
thereby
placing
the
official
stamp
on
this

as
a
useful
building
for
outdoor
people

consequently

shacks

use

frequently
worth
more
a

so
the
home
builders
used
other
material
they
built
themselves
houses

kerosene
cans

of
any

every
thing
usually
these
houses
were
dugouts
as
is
the
barrel
one
shown
in

not
infrequently
made
a
house

a
hollow

more
practical
and
one
that
can
be
used
almost
anywhere

where

the
ones
that
we
are
going
to

now
are
in

almost

the
real
difference
being
in
the
peculiar
log
work
of
the
barabara
in
place
of
the
rafters
of
the
said
hogan
to
build
a
barabara
you
will
need
eight
short
posts
for
the
outside
wall
and
six
or
eight
longer
posts
for
the
inside
supports
fig
the
outside
posts
should
stand
about
three
feet
above
the
ground
after
they
have
been
planted
in
the
holes
dug
for
the
purpose
the
top
of
the
posts
should
be
cut
as
shown
by
fig
in
order
to
fit
in
the
notch
fig
the
cross
logs
where
they
cross
each
other
should
be
notched
like
those
of
a
log
cabin
figs
and
or
flattened
at
the
points
of
contact
plant
your
first
four
posts
for
the
front
of
your
barabara
in
a
line
two
posts
for
the
corners
and
fig
and
two
at
the
middle
of
the
line
and
for
plan
fig
the
tops
of
these
posts
should
be
level
with
each
other
so
that
if
a
straight
log
is
placed
over
them
the
log
will
lie
level
next
plant
the
two
and
fig
at
equal
distances
from
the
two
front
posts
and
make
them
a
few
feet
farther
apart
than
are
the
front
posts
the
sketch
of
the

is
drawn
in
very
steep

building
next
resting
a
long
log
over
the
side

at
the
front
of
the
building
the

course
must
be
enough
taller
than
the
two
end
posts
to
allow
for
the
thickness
of
the
log
so
that
the
front
log
will
rest
upon
their
top
next
put
your
two
corner
logs
on
and
your
outside
rail
is
complete
build
the
inside
rail
in
the
same
manner
then
continue
to
build
up
with
the
logs
as
shown
in

you
have

then
cover
it
with

it
with
hay

straw
and
hold
the
thatch
in

with
poles
or
sticks
as
shown
in

the

may
also
be
covered
with
earth

this
sort
of
a
house
if
built
with
planks
or
boards
nailed
securely
to
the
rafters
and
covered
with
earth
and
sod
will
make
a
splendid
cave
house
for
boys
and
a
playhouse
for
children
on
the
lawn
and
it
may
be
covered
with
green
growing
sod
so
as
to
have
the
appearance
of
an
ornamental
mound
the
instinct
of
the
is
deeply
implanted
in
the
hearts
of
boys
and
every
year
we
have
a
list
of
fatal
accidents
caused
by
the
little
fellows
digging

which
frequently
fall
in

bury
the
little

ventilated
by
a
chimney
hole
in
the
roof
as

this

the
framework
is
a
good
one
to
use
in
all
parts
of
the
country
for
more
or
less
permanent
camps
but
the
long

little
traps
he
knows
just
how
to
build
a
navajo
hogan
or
at
least
the
particular
navajo
hogan
shown
by

and
this
one
is
and
may
be
improved
by
notching
the
logs

building
them
up
one
on
top
of
the
other
to
the
required
height
after
laying
some
rafters
for
the
roof
and
leaving
a
hole
for
the
chimney
the
frame
is
complete
in
hot
countries
no
chimney
hole
is
left
in
the
roof
because
the
people
there
do
not
build
fires
inside
the
house
they
go
indoors
to
keep
cool
and
not
to
get
warm
but
the
navajo
hogan
also
makes
a
good
house
in
places
where
people
really
need
a
fire
make

doorway

leaving
an
opening

and
chinking
the
logs
along
the
opening

hold
them
in
place
until
the
is
nailed
or
pegged
to
them

then
build
a
shed
entranceway
fig
which
is
necessary
because
the
slanting
sides
of
the
house
with
an
unroofed
doorway
have
no
protection
against
the
free
entrance
of

xxiv
how
to
build
an
american
boy
hogan
the
first
time
any
working
plans
of
an
underground
house
for
boys
were
published
was
when
an
article
by
the
present
writer
on
the
subject
appeared
in
the
home
afterward
it
was
published
with
a
lot
of
similar
material
in
the
jack
of
all
trades
since
then
other
writers
have
not
hesitated
to
use
the
author
sketches
with
very
little
alteration
imitation
is
the
sincerest
compliment
although
it
is
not
always
fair
but
it
does
however
show
the
popularity
of
the
idea
the
american
boy
hogan
may
be
built
like
the
preceding
shacks
of
the
material
found
in
the
woods
or
it
may
be
constructed
of
old
boards
and
waste
material
to
be
found
in
village
back
yards
or
on
the
farm
or
if
the
boys
have
the
price
or
if
they
can
interest
their
fathers
or
uncles
in
their
scheme
it
may
be
built
of
milled
lumber
procured
at
the
frame
procure
some
good
sound
planks
and
some
pieces
of
two
by
four
with
which
to
build
your
frame
the
hogan
should
be
large
enough
to
allow
room
for
a
table
made
of
a
some
benches
stools
or
chairs
and
the
ceilings
should
be
high
enough
for
the
tallest
boy
to
stand
erect
without
bumping
his
head
furniture
one
funny
thing
about
this
house
is
that
it
must
be
furnished
before
it
is
built
because
the
doorway
and
passageway
will
be
too
small
to
admit
any
furniture
larger
than
a
stool
select
or
make
your
furniture
and
have
it
ready
then
decide
upon
the
location
of
your
hogan
which
should
be
like
the
western
dugouts
on
the
edge
of
some
bank
fig
in
this
diagram
the
dotted
line
shows
how
the
bank
originally
sloped
foundation
the
real
hard
work
connected
with
this
is
the
digging
of
the
foundation
one
man
started
to
build
one
of
these
hogans
but
he
weakened
before
he
had
the
foundation
dug
he
wrote
the
author
a
long
letter
complaining
of
the
hard
work
at
the
same
time
the
author
was
receiving
letters
from
telling
how
much
fun
they
had
in
building
and
finishing
their
underground
houses
caves
ever
since
robinson
crusoe
and
swiss
family
robinson
were
written
cave
houses
have
been
particularly
attractive
to
boys
no
doubt
they
were
just
as
attractive
before
these
books
were
written
and
that
may
be
the
reason
the
books
themselves
are
so
popular
at
any
rate
when
the
author
was
a
small
boy
he
was
always
searching
for
natural
caves
or
trying
to
dig
them
for
himself
and
so
were
all
of
his
companions
one
of
the
most
charming
features
of
the
tom
sawyer
and
huckleberry
finn
stories
is
that
part
connected
with
the

dangerous

the
trouble
is
that
with
caves
which
the
boys
dig
for
themselves
there
is
always
serious
danger
of
the
roof
falling
in
and
smothering
the
young
troglodytes
but
a
properly
built
underground
hogan
is
perfectly
safe
from
such
accidents
framing
after
you
have
levelled
off
the
foundation
erect
the
rear
posts
of
and
fig
these
posts
should
be
of
the
same
height
and
tall
enough
to
allow
the
roof
to
slant
toward
the
front
as
in
fig
the
front
posts
and
although
shorter
than
the
back
posts
should
be
tall
enough
to
allow
headroom
one
two
or
three
more
posts
may
be
erected
between
the
post
and
the
post
if
additional
strength
is
required
the
same
is
true
of
the
sides
and
in
place
of
having
only
one
post
in
the
middle
of
each
side
and
fig
there
may
be
two
or
three
posts
all
according
to
the
size
of
the
house
you
are
building
the
main
point
is
to
make
compact
and
strong
of
your
framework
so
that
in
the
wet
weather
the
banks
surrounding
it
will
not
be
tempted
to
push
in
the
sides
and
spoil
your
house
decaying
wood
locust
chestnut
and
cedar
will
last
longer
than
other
varieties
of
wood
when
exposed
to
contact
with
damp
earth
but
common
wood
which
rots
easily
may
be
protected
by
preservatives
one
of
which
is
boiled
with
pulverized
charcoal
stirred
into
it
until
a
black
paint
is
produced
some
people
say
that
a
coat
of
charcoal
paint
will
preserve
even
a
basswood
fence
post
for
a
lifetime
and
if
that
is
true
a
hogan
protected
by
a
coating
upon
the
outside
of

made
by
stirring
fine
charcoal
into

it
is
as
thick

of
my
readers
will
have
occasion

having
some

the
uprights
in

they
can
be
secured
with
temporary
braces

those
shown
running
diagonally
across
from

to
you
may
then
proceed
to
board
up
the
sides

slipping
the
planks
between
the

may
be
made

or
it
may
be
made
of

those
shown
on

over
the
planking
or
anything
in

which
will
keep
out

water
as
for
looks
that
will
not
count
because
the
roof
is
to
be
afterward
covered
with
sod

if
you
wish
to
make
the
roof
as
the
made
theirs
put
your
biggest
logs
crosswise
from
to
of
your
house
for
rafters
and
across
the
larger
logs
lay
a
lot
of
small
poles
as
close
together
as
may
be
running
from
the
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
fill
in
the
cracks
between
with
moss
or
calk
them
with
dry
grass
on
them
place
a
layer
of
brush
browse
or
small
sticks
and
over
this
a
thick
coating
of
clay
or
ordinary
mud
and
pack
it
down
hard
by
tramping
it
with
your
feet
until
it
becomes
a
smooth
and
tightly
packed
crust
over
this
you
can
put
your
sod
and
weeds
to
conceal
your
secret

make
the
frame
for
the
underground

nail
across
the

form
the
top

the
doorway
after
which
put
in
the
supports
and
next
build
the
frame
and
join
it
to
by
the
two
pieces
and
and
put
in
the
middle

the
passageway
should
be
about
six
feet
long

enable
you
to
creep
through

comfort
the
bottom
piece
can
be
nailed
to
a
couple
of
sticks
driven
in
the
ground
for
that
purpose
the
next
thing
in
order
is
the
floor
and
to
make
this
firm
you
must
lay
a
number
of
parallel
to
and
and
see
that
they
are
level
you
will
need
a
number
of
shorter
pieces
of
the
same
material
to
run
parallel
to
and
for
the
hall
floor
as
may
be
seen
in
fig
across
these
nail
your
floor
securely
as
shown
in
fig
there
are
no
windows
shown
in
the
diagram
but
if
the
builders
wish
one
it
can
be
placed
immediately
over
the
entrance
or
hallway
in
the
frame
marked
fig
in
which
case
the
top
covering
of
dirt
must
be
shovelled
away
from
it
to
admit
the
light
in
the
same
manner
that
it
is
in
the
dugout
shown
in
fig
and
also
in
the
small
sketch
fig
the
ventilator
shown
in
fig
may
be
replaced
if
thought
desirable
by
a
chimney
for
an
open
fire
on
account
of
the
need
of
ventilation
a
stove
would
not
be
the
proper
thing
for
an
underground
house
but
an
open
fire
would
help
the
ventilation
in
the
diagram
the
ventilator
is
set
over
a
square
hole
in
the
roof
it
may
be
made
of
a
barrel
or
barrels
with
the
heads
knocked
out
placed
over
the
hole
in
the
roof

may
know
that
the
air
in
your
little
hogan
is
pure

how
to

boys
you
have
now
passed
through
the
of
shack
making
you
are
older
than
you
were
when
you
began
you
have
acquired
more
skill
and
more
muscle
and
it
is
time
to
begin
to
handle
the
woodsman
axe
to
handle
it
skilfully
and
to
use
it
as
a
tool
with
which
to
fashion
anything
from
a
table
to
a
house
none
of
you
is
too
young
to
learn
to
use
the
axe
general

all
of
them
could
wield
an
axe
by
the
time
they
were
eight
or
nine
years
old
and
do
it
without
chopping
off
their
toes
or
splitting
any
one
else

open
remember
that
every
time
you
hurt
yourself
with
an
axe
i
have
a
yellow
ribbon
for
you
to
wear
as
a
chump
mark
but
joking
aside
we
must
now
get
down
to
serious
work
of
preparing
the
logs
in
order
to
build
us
a
little
cabin
of
our
own

log
for
our
gang
or
a
log
camp
for
our
troop
of
scouts
notching
logs
to
make
the
logs
hold
together
at
the
corners
of
our
cabins
it
is
necessary
to
lock
them
in
some
manner
and
the
usual
way
is
to
notch
them
you
may
cut
flat
notches
like
those
shown
in
fig
and
this
will
hold
the
logs
together
as
shown
by
or
you
may
only
flatten
the
ends
making
the
general
putnam
joint
shown
in
fig
this
is
called
after
general
putnam
because
the
log
cabins
at
his
old
camp
near
my
farm
at
redding
are
made
in
this
manner
or
you
may
use
the
pike
notch
which
has
a
cut
on
the
lower
log
as
shown
by
fig
made
to
fit
into
a
triangular
notch
shown
by
when
fitted
together
these
logs
look
like
the
sketch
marked
which
was
drawn
from
a
cabin
built
in
this
manner
but
the
simplest
notch
is
the
rounded
one
shown
by
and
fig
when
these
are
locked
together
they
will
fit
like
those
shown
at
fig
away
up
north
the
people
dovetail
the
ends
of
the
logs
fig
so
that
their
ends
fit
snugly
together
and
are
also
securely
locked
by
their
dovetail
shape
to
build
a
log
house
place
the
two
sill
logs
on
the
ground
or
on
the
foundation
made
for
them
then
two
other
logs
across
them
as
shown
in
fig
handling
the
logs
that
the
logs
may
be
more
easily
handled
they
should
be
piled
up
on
a
skidway
which
is
made
by
resting
the
top
ends
of
a
number
of
poles
upon
a
big
log
or
some
other
sort
of
elevation
and
their
lower
ends
upon
the
ground
with
this
arrangement
the
logs
may
be
rolled
off
without
much
trouble
as
they
are
used
chinking
a

cabin

with
hardwood
logs
or
with
logs
can
seldom
be
made
as
tight
as
one
built
with
the
straight
spruce
logs
of
the
virgin
forests
the
latter
will
lie
as
close
as
the
ones
shown
in
fig
while
the
former
on
account
of
their
unevenness
will
have
large
cracks
between
them
like
those
shown
in
fig
these
cracks
may
be
stopped
up
by
quartering
small
pieces
of
timber
and
fig
and
fitting
these
quartered
pieces
into
the
cracks
between
the
logs
where
they
are

cabins
really
this
is
the
best
way
to
plan
a
large
cabin
if
you
intend
to
erect
one
from
your
model
you
can
see
at
a
glance
just
how
to
divide
your
cabin
up
into
rooms
where
you
want
to
place
the
fireplace
windows
and
doors
and
i
would
advise
you
always
to
make
a
small
model
before
building
make
the
model
about
one
foot
three
inches
long
by
ten
inches
wide
using
sticks
for
logs
a
little
less
than
one
inch
in
diameter
that
is
one
inch
through
or
one
inch
thick
i
have
taken
these
dimensions
or
measurements
from
a
little
model
that
i
have
before
me
here
in
my
studio
but
of
course
you
can
vary
them
according
to
the
plans
of
your
cabin

in
what
is
known
as
the
unexplored
country
that
is
the
unmapped
country
of

we
travelled
over
trails
that

were
untouched
by

he
carried
up

this

was
then
sixty
years
of
age
but
all
this
talk
is
for
the
purpose
of
telling
you
the
use
of
the

log
our
pioneer
ancestors
used
them
to
ascend
to
the
loft
over
their
cabins
where
they
slept

it
is
also
a
good
ladder
to
use
for
and
a
one
for
our
underground
hogans

we
have
an
entrance
through
the
top
instead
of
one
at
the
side
shown
by

since
you
have
learned
how
to
use
the
axe
you
may
make
one
of
these
primitive
ladders
to
reach
the
in
your
barn
if
you
have
a
barn
you
may
make
the
ladder
of
one
log
if
you
set
the
pole
or
log
upright
and
notch
it
on
both
sides
so
that
you
can
clasp
it
with
your

my

readers
may
build
a
similar
house
by
using
small

the

will
brighten
and
warm
the
interior
of
the

and
make
things
comfortable
the
chimney
may
be
made
by
first
building
a
fireplace
of
sod
or
stone
as
shown
in

on

how
to

the

and
the

the
red
jacket
is
another
camp
but
this
you
see
has
straight
walls
marking
it
as
white
man
in
form
not
apparently
borrowed
from
the
red
men
it
is
however
a
good
comfortable
rough
camp
and
figs
and
show
how
it
was
evolved
or
grew
to
build
the
red
jacket
one
will
first
have
to
know
how
to
build
the
more
simple
forms
which
we
call
the
new
brunswick
then
the
next
step
will
be
the
christopher
gist
and
last
the
red
jacket
we
will
now
begin
with
the
new
brunswick
the
new
brunswick
by
referring
to
fig
you
will
see
that
it
is
practically
a
deep
adirondack
camp
with
a
built
in
front
of
it
to
build
this
camp
make
the
plan
about
six
feet
by
twelve
on
the
ground
of
course
the
back
logs
must
be
something
over
six
feet
long
to
allow
for
six
feet
in
the
clear
notch
about
four
or
five
back
logs
with
the
plain
rounded
notch
already
described
and
illustrated
by
fig
then
lay
the
side
sill
logs
and
erect
two
upright
forked
sticks
for
the
front
of
your
cabin
to
hold
the
cross
stick
which
supports
the
roof
rafter
now
build
up
your
cabin
as
you
would
a
log
house
notching
only
the
small
ends
of
the
side
logs
and
saving
the
larger
ends
for
the
front
between
each
of
these
chink
with
other
logs
shaped
to
fit
the
spaces
or
with
pieces
of
other
logs
so
as
to
make
the
front
higher
than
the
rear
when
the
logs
meet
the
rafter
pole
all
the
cracks
are
chinked
up
with
small
pieces
of
wood
and
the
crevices
calked
with
moss
then
the
roof
of
bark
is
put
on
shingled
as
described
for
the
pontiac
and
illustrated
by
figs
and
the
bark
is
kept
in
place
by
laying
sticks
or
poles
over
it
to
weight
it
down
as
may
be
seen
by
the
plan
of
the
roof
fig
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
way
the
unfinished
roof
would
look
to
you
if
you
were
looking
down
upon
it
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
or
an
aeroplane
after
you
have
your
camp
finished
take
some
green
logs
from
the
if
they
are
handy
and
split
them
in
half
by
one
of
the
methods
shown
by
fig
then
leaving
enough
room
for
a
passageway
erect
your
of
green
logs
resting
them
against
a
pole
laid
between
two
forked
sticks
be
sure
you
have
the
green
split
side
of
the
log
facing
the
camp
and
the
bark
side
facing
outdoors
because
the
green
wood
will
not
burn
readily
and
as
the
is
built
close
to
the
if
the
shield
is
made
of
very
inflammable
material
it
will
soon
burn
down
some
woods
you
know
burn
well
when
green
and
some
woods
must
be
made
dry
before
we
can
use
them
for
fuel
but
the
wood
we
want
for
the
is
the
sort
that
will
not
burn
readily
the
woods
we
save
to
use
in
our
fire
christopher
gist
the
next
camp
is
the
christopher
gist
named
after
george
camping
friend
this
camp
as
you
may
see
by
fig
is
built
like
a
new
brunswick
except
that
the
side
sill
logs
are
much
longer
as
is
also
the
log
which
extends
over
the
doorway
then
in
place
of
having
a
built
by
itself
the
in
fig
is
the
other
end
of
the
cabin
built
just
the
same
as
the
rear
end
but
it
should
be
built
of
peeled
logs
as
they
are
less
liable
to
catch
afire
than
the
ones
with
the
bark
upon
them
if
you
feel
real
lazy
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
peel
the
bark
off
from
the
inside
half
of
the
log
above
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
roof

cabin
doors
and
and
foot
latches
and
how
to
make
them
perhaps
my
reader
has
noticed
that
although
many
of
the
descriptions
of
how
to
build
the
shacks
shanties
shelters
camps
sheds
tilts
and
so
forth
are
given
with
somewhat
minute
details
little
or
nothing
has
been
said
regarding
the
doors
and
of
course
we
have
no
doors
on
the
open
adirondack
camp
but
we
have
passed
the
open
camps
now
and
are
well
into
cabin
work
and
all
cabins
have
some
sort
of
a
door
all
doors
have
or
should
have
some
sort
of
a
so
the
doors
and
have
been
saved
for
this
place
in
the
book
where
they
are
sandwiched
between
the
log
cabin
and
the
log
houses
proper
which
is
probably
the
best
place
for
them
the
gummers
who
collect
spruce
gum
in
the
north
woods
and
the
trappers
and
all
of
the
hermit
class
of
woodsmen
frequently
come
home
to
their
little
shack
with
their
hands
full
of
traps
or
with
game
on
their
shoulders
and
consequently
they
want
to
have
a
door
which
may
be
opened
without
the
necessity
of
dropping
their
load
and
so
they
use
a
foot
latch
foot
latch
one
of
the
simplest
of
the
foot
latches
consists
of
a
piece
of
wood
cut
out
by
the
aid
of
axe
and
to
the
form
shown
by
fig
a
hole
in
the
door
cut
for
that
purpose
admits
the
flattened
and
notched
end
and
upon
the
inside
it
fits
the
round
log
sill
the
owner
of
the
shack
when
reaching
home
steps
upon
the
foot
latch
fig
which
lifts
up
the
catch
on
the
inside
and
allows
the
door
to
swing
open
trigger
latch
fig
shows
a
more
complicated
form
of
latch
with
a
trigger
protruding
from
the
lower
part
of
the
door
which
is
hinged
to
a
wooden
shaft
and
the
shaft
in
turn
is
connected
with
the
latch
the
fastenings
of
the
trigger
to
the
shaft
and
the
shaft
to
the
latch
are
made
with
hardwood
pegs
or
wire
nails
which
move
freely
in
their
sockets
the
latch
is
the
simplest
form
of
a
wooden
bar
fastened
at
one
end
with
a
screw
or
nail
on
which
it
can
move
up
and
down
freely
the
other
end
is
allowed
to
drop
into
the
catch
the
latch
itself
is
similar
to
the
one
shown
in
figs
and
the
trigger
is
also
fastened
to
a
block
on
the
outside
of
the
door
by
a
nail
or
peg
upon
which
it
moves
freely
so
that
when
the
weight
of
the
foot
is
placed
upon
the
trigger
outside
the
door
that
end
is
forced
down
which
pushed
the
end
attached
to
the
shaft
up
this
pushes
the
shaft
up
and
the
shaft
pushes
latch
thus
the
door
is
unfastened
the

the
edge
of
the

trigger

but
in
this
one
the
literally
hangs
outside
and
any
one
may
enter
by
pulling
it
figs
and
but
when
the
owner
is
in
and
does
not
want
to
be
interrupted
he
pulls
the
string
in
which
tells
the
outsider
that
he
must
knock
before
he
can
be
admitted
this
simplest
form
of
latch
has
been
here
put
upon
the
simplest
form
of
a
door
a
door
with
a
wooden
hinge
made
by
nailing
a
round
rod
to
the
edge
of
the
door
and
allowing
the
ends
of
the
rod
to
project
above
and
below
the
door
in
the
sill
log
below
the
door
a
hole
about
two
inches
deep
is
bored
to
receive
the
short
end
of
the
hinge
rod
above
a
deeper
hole
is
bored
to
receive
the
long
end
of
the
hinge
rod
to
hang
the
door
run
the
long
end
up
in
the
top
hole
far
enough
to
lift
the
door
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
drop
the
lower
end
of
the
hinge
rod
in
the
lower
hole
your
door
is
then
hung
and
may
swing
back
and
forth
at
your
pleasure
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
such
a
door
admits
plenty
of
cold
air
it
is
a
very
popular
door
for
camps
and
is
even
used
for

secret
locks
are
more
useful
than
strong
ones
for
a
country
house
which
is
left
alone
during
the
winter
months
for
it
is
not
so
much
cupidity
which
causes
such
houses
to
be
broken
into
as
it
is
the
curiosity
of
the
native
boys
but
while
these
lads
often
do
not
hesitate
to
force

pick
a

they
will
seldom
go
as
far
as
to

if
your

your

is
safe
from

they
make
the
safest

is
all
well
enough
to
build
our
shacks
and
shanties
and
camps
of
logs
with
the
bark
on

when
one
wishes
to
build

one
wants
a
house

abraham

log

still

it
was

logs
with
no
bark
on

there
is
a
log
house
still
standing
in
dayton
it
is
said
to
have
been
built
before
the
town
was
there
but
there
is
no
bark
on
the
logs
bark
holds
moisture
and
moisture
creates
decay
by
inviting
fibrous
and
threadlike
cousins
of
the
toadstool
to
grow
on
the
damp
wood
and
work
their
way
into
its
substance
the
bark
also
shelters
all
sorts
of
boring
insects
and
the
boring
insects
make
holes
through
the
logs
which
admit
the
rain
and
in
the
end
cause
decay
so
that
the
first
thing
to
remember
is
to
peel
the
logs
of
which
you
propose
to
build
the
cabin

is
now

cabin

hugh
baker
dean
of
the
new
york
state
college
of
forestry
writes
me
that
two
or
three
applications
of
warm
oil
with
a
brush
will
be
very
helpful
and
will
probably
be
all
that
the
ordinary
man
can
do
creosote
is
the
best
preservative
because
of
its
penetrating
power
and
the
way
it
acts
upon
the
fibres
of
wood
and
in
the
end
is
cheaper
than
a
good
many
other
things
which
have
been
used
to
preserve
timber
in
fact
various
forms
of
creosote
are
preservers
of
organic
matter
there
is
no
advantage
in
using
charcoal
at
all
and
i
presume
suggestions
have
been
made
for
using
it
because
we
know
that
charred
wood
is
more
durable
is
good
ordinary
paint
will
be
better
but
neither
of
them
is
as
effective
as
creosote
and
both
are
more
expensive
you
will
find
that
carbolineum
and
other
patent
preparations
are
recommended
very
highly
they
are
good
but
expensive
and
the
difference
in
price
between
these
patent
preparations
and
ordinary
creosote
is
much
larger
than
is
justified
by
their
increased
value
creosote
can
be
procured
in

if

you
may
rest
your
sill
logs
upon
posts
or
stone
piles
in
either
case
in
the
northern
states
they
should
extend
three
feet
below
the
ground
so
as
to
be
below
and
prevent
the
upheaval
of
the
spring
thaw
from
throwing
your
house
out
of
plumb
roofing
all
the
log
cabins
were
roofed
with
shakes
splits
clapboards
or
shingles
as
already
described
and
illustrated
by
figs
and
but
they
are
usually
shingled
with
the
shingle
of
commerce
you
may
however
cover
the
roof
with
planks
as
shown
by
fig
or
with
bark
weighted
down
with
poles
as
shown
by
fig
in
covering
it
with
board
or
plank
nail
the
latter
on
as
you
would
on
a
floor
then
lay

course
of
boards
over
the
cracks
which
show
between
the
boards
on
the
first
course
gables
the
gable
ends
of
the
cabin
should
be
built
up
of
logs
with
the
rafters
of
the
roof
running
between
the
logs
as
they
are
in
figs
and
but
the
roof
may
be
built
as
it
frequently
is
nowadays
of
mill
lumber
in
which
case
it
may
be
framed
as
shown
by
figs
and
the
gable
end
above
the
logs
filled
in
with
upright
poles
as
shown
in
figs
and
or
planked
up
as
shown
in
the
southern
fig
or
the
ends
may
be
boarded
up
and
covered
with
tar
paper
as
shown
in
fig
or
the
gable
end
may
be
shingled
with
ordinary
shingles
fig
steep
roof
remember
that
the
steeper
the
roof
is
the
longer
the
shingles
will
last
because
the
water
will
run
off
readily
and
quickly
on
a
steep
surface
and
the
shingles
have
an
opportunity
to
dry
quickly
besides
which
the
snow
slides
off
a
steep
roof
and
the
driving
rains
do
not
beat
under
the
shingles
if
you
are
using
milled
lumber
for
the
roof
erect
the
rafters
at
the
gable
end
first
with
the
ridge
board
as
shown
in
fig
and
in
greater
detail
in
fig
put
the
other
rafters
two
or
three
feet
apart
let
your
roof
overhang
the
walls
by
at
least
seven
or
eight
inches
so
as
to
keep
the
drip
from
the
rain
free
of
the
wall
it
is
much
easier
for
the
architect
to
draw
a
log
house
than
it
is
for
a
builder
to
erect
one
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
draughtsman
can
make
his
logs
as
straight
as
he
chooses
also
that
he
can
put
the
uneven
places
where
they
fit
best
but
except
in
countries
the
tree
trunks
do
not
grow
as
straight
as
the
logs
in
my
pictures
and
you
must
pick
out
the
logs
which
will
fit
together
run
them
alternately
butt
and
head
that
is
if
you
put
the
thick
end
of
the
log
at
the
end
of
your
house
with
the
small
end
at
the
left
put
the
next
log
with
the
small
end
at
the
right
and
thick
end
at
the
left
otherwise
if
all
the
thick
ends
are
put
at
one
side
and
the
small
ends
at
the
other
your
house
will
be
taller
at
one
end
than
at
the
other
as
is
the
case
with
some
of
our
previous
shacks
and
camps
figs
and
which
are
purposely
built
that
way
if
it
is
planned
to
have
glass
window
lights
make
your
window
openings
of
the
proper
size
to
fit
the
which
come
with
the
sashes
from
the
factory
in
any
case
if
the
cabin
is
to
be
left
unoccupied
you
should
have
heavy
shutters
to
fit
in
the
window
opening
so
as
to
keep
out
trespassers
chinking
if
your
logs
are
uneven
and
leave
large
spaces
between
them
they
may
be
chinked
up
by
filling
the
spaces
with
mud
plaster
or
cement
and
then
forcing
in
quartered
pieces
of
small
logs
and
nailing
them
or
spiking
them
in
position
if
your
logs
are
straight
spruce
logs
and
fit
snugly
the
cracks
may
be
calked
up
with
swamp
moss
sphagnum
or
like
a
boat
with
oakum
or
the
larger
spaces
may
be
filled
with
flat
stones
and
covered
with
mud
this
mud
will
last
from
one
to
seven
or
eight
years
i
have
some
on
my
own
log
cabin
that
has
been
there
even
a
longer
time
xxxvii
a
hunter
or
fisherman
cabin
in
all
the
hilly
and
mountainous
states
there
are
tracts
of
forest
lands
and
waste
lands
of
no
use
to
the
farmer
and
of
no
use
to
settlers
but
such
places
offer
ideal
spots
for
summer
camps
for
boys
and
naturalists
for
fishermen
and
sportsmen
and
here
they
may
erect
their
cabins
and
enjoy
themselves
in
a
healthy
natural
manner
these
cabins
will
vary
according
to
the
wants
of
the
owners
according
to
the
material
at
hand
and
the
land
upon
which
they
are
built
by
extending
the
rafters
of
the
roof
the
latter
may
be
extended
to
protect
the
front
and
make
a
sort
of
piazza
which
may
be
floored
with
puncheons
the
logs
forming
the
sides
of
the
house
may
be
allowed
to
extend
so
as
to
make
a
wall
or
fence
as
they
do
on
the
side
of
the
frontispiece
thus
preventing
the
danger
of
falling
over
the
cliff
upon
which
this
cabin
is
perched
and
receiving
injury
or
an
ducking
in
the
lake
they
may
also
be
extended
as
they
are
on
the
left
to
make
a
shield
behind
which
a
is
concealed
or
to
protect
an
enclosure
for
the
storage
of
the
larger
camp
utensils
in
fact
this
drawing
is
made
as
a
suggestion
and
not
to
be
copied
exactly
because
every
spot
differs
from
every
other
spot
and
one
wants
to
make
one
house
conform
to
the
requirements
of
its
location
for
instance
the
logs
upon
the
side
might
be
allowed
to
extend
all
the
way
up
to
the
roof
as
they
do
at
the
bottom
and
thus
make
a
cosey
corner
protected
from
the
wind
and
storm
the
windows
in
such
a
cabin
may
be
made
very
small
for
all
work
is
supposed
to
be
done
outdoors
and
when
more
light
is
needed
on
the
inside
the
door
may
be
left
open
in
a
country
or
a
mosquito
country
however
when
you
are
out
of
reach
of
screen
doors
may
be
tacked
over
the
windows
and
a
portière
of
over
the
doorway

how
to
make
a
wyoming

hoko
river

a
shake
cabin
a
canadian
mossback
and
a
or
southern
house
one
of
the
charms
of
a
building
is
the
many
possibilities
of
novelties
suggested
by
the
logs
themselves
in
the
hunter
cabin
we
have
seen
how
the
ends
of
the
logs
were
allowed
to
stick
out
in
front
and
form
a
rail
for
the
front
stoop
the
builders
of
the
olebos
have
followed
this
idea
still
further
the
wyoming
olebo
in
fig
we
see
that
the
side
walls
of
the
pen
are
allowed
to
extend
on
each
side
so
as
to
enclose
a
room
or
if
you
choose
to
so
call
it
a
front
porch
veranda
stoop
piazza
or
gallery
according
to
the
section
of
the
country
in
which
you
live
so
as
to
better
understand
this
cabin
the
plan
is
drawn
in
perspective
with
the
cabin
above

made
to
appear
as
if
some
one
had
lifted

the
sides
of
your
house

the
of

for

and
the

protrudes
above
the

the
southern
or
cabin
now
we
come
to
the
most
delightful
of
all
forms
of
a
log
house
the
one
shown
in
fig
is
a
very
simple
one
such
as
might
be
built
by
any
group
of
boys
but
i
have
lived
in
such
houses
down
south
that
were
very
much
more
elaborate
frequently
they
have
a
second
story
which
extends
like
the
roof
over
the
open
gallery
between
the
pens
the
chimneys
are
at
the
gable
ends
that
is
on
the
outside
of
the
house
and
since
we
will
have
quite
a
space
devoted
to
fireplaces
and
chimneys
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
here
that
in
many
portions
of
the
south
the
fireplaces
while
broad
are
often
quite
shallow
and
not
nearly
so
deep
as
some
found
in
the
old
houses
on
long
island
in
new
york
and
the
eastern
states
the
open
gallery
makes
a
delightful
cool
lounging
place
also
a
place
for
the
ladies
to
sit
and
sew
and
serves
as
an
during
the
warm
weather
this
sort
of
house
is
inappropriate
and
ill
fitted
for
the
climate
which
produced
the
olebo
the
mossback
and
the
kanuck
but
exactly
suited
for
our
southern
states
and
very
pleasant
even
as
far
north
as
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
i
have
lived
in
one
part
of
every
summer
for
the
last
years
in
the
mountains
of
northern
pennsylvania
the
may
be
built
by
boys
with
the
two
rooms
ten
by
ten
and
a
gallery
six
feet
wide
or
the
two
rooms
six
by
six
and
a
gallery
five
feet
wide
the
plan
may
be
seen
on
the
sketch
below
the
house
fig
where
you
only
expect
to
use
the
house
in
the
summer
months
a
or
can
be
used
with
comfort
even
in
the
northern
states
but
in
the
in
such
states
as
michigan
and
part
of
new
york
the
gallery
would
be
filled
up
with
drifting

xxxix
native
names
for
the
parts
of
a
kanuck
log
cabin
and
how
to
build
one
if
the
writer
forgets
himself
once
in
a
while
and
uses
words
not
familiar
to
his
boy
readers
he
hopes
they
will
forgive
him
and
put
all
such
slips
down
as
the
result
of
leaving
boys
company
once
in
a
while
and
associating
with
men
the
reader
knows
that
men
dearly
love
big
ungainly
words
and
that
just
as
soon
as
boys
do
something
worth
while
the
men
get
busy
hunting
up
some
name
for
it
when
one
is
talking
of
foreign
things
however
it
is
well
to
give
the
foreign
names
for
those
things
and
since
the
next
house
to
be
described
is
not
a
real
american
one
but
a
native
of
canada
the
canadian
names
are
given
for
its
parts
while
in
northern
quebec
making
notes
for
the
kanuck
the
writer
enlisted
the
interest
of
a
fellow
member
of
the
club
of
america
doctor
alexander
lambert
and
through
him
secured
the
names
of
all
parts
of
the
canadian
shack
the
author
is
not
a
and
although
like
most
of
his
readers
he
studied
french
at
school
what
he
learned
of
that
great
language
is
now
securely
locked
up
in
one
of
the
vaults
of
his
brain
and
the
key
lost
he
owns
up
to
his
ignorance
because
he
is
a
scout
and
would
not
try
to
deceive
his
readers
also
because
if
the
reader
knowledge
of
french
enables
him
to
find
some
error
the
writer
can
sidestep
the
mistake
and
say
mine
but
joking
aside
these
names
are
the
ones
used
in
the
province
of
quebec
and
are
here
given
not
because
they
are
good
french
but
because
they
are
the
names
used
by
the
builders

the
natives

by
the
indians

how
to
make
a
pole
house
and
how
to
make
a
unique
but
thoroughly
american
totem
log
house
a
pole
house
is
a
log
house
with
the
logs
set
upright
we
call
it
a
pole
house
because
usually
the
logs
are
smaller
than
those
used
for
a
log
house
the
pole
house
fig
is
built
in
the
manner
shown
by
figs
and
but
in
the
present
instance
the
is
a
log
which
is
allowed
to
extend
some
distance
beyond
the
house
both
in
front
and
rear
and
the
front
end
of
the
is
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
grotesque
or
comical
animal
head
like
those
we
see
on
the
roof
is
made
of
shakes
see
figs
to
and
the
shakes
are
held
in
place
by
poles
pegged
onto
the
roof
in
much
the
same
manner
as
we
have
described
and
called
for
the
kanuck
this
pole
cabin
may
have
an
dutch
door
which
will
add
to
its
quaintness
and
may
have
but
one
room
which
will
answer
the
many
purposes
of
a
and
a
at
the
back
can
be
used
for
a
kitchen
american
totem
log
house
but
if
you
really
want
something
unique
build
a
log
house
on
the
general
plan
shown
by
figs
and
then
carve
the
ends
of
all
the
extending
logs
to
represent
the
heads
of
reptiles
beasts
or
birds
also
carve
the
posts
which
support
the
end
logs
on
the
front
gallery
porch
or
veranda
in
the
form
of
you
may
add
further
to
the
quaint
effect
by
placing
small
where
your
steps
begin
on
the
walk

and
adding
a
tall
fig
for
your
family

or
the
totem
of
your
clan

how
to
arrange
and
cut
your
logs

the
pens

supposed
to
be
behind

half
of
this
room
being
open
with
the
front
room
it
makes
a
large
the
stairs
lead
up
to
the
overhead
the
latter
are
made
by
dividing
the
space
with
partitions
to
suit
your
convenience
before
building
take
your
and
a
number
of
little
sticks
to
represent
the
logs
of
your
cabin
call
an
inch
a
foot
or
a
half
inch
a
foot
as
will
suit
your
convenience
and
measure
all
the
sticks
on
this
scale
using
inches
or
parts
of
inches
for
feet
then
sit
down
on
the
ground
or
on
the
floor
and
experiment
in
building
a
toy
house
or
miniature
model
until
you
make
one
which
is
satisfactory
next
glue
the
little
logs
of
the
pen
together
but
make
the
roof
so
that
it
may
be
taken
off
and
put
on
like
the

box
keep

they
will
a
set
of
plans
and
sections
on
paper
fig
is
a
very
simple
plan
and
only
put
here
as
a
suggestion
you
can
put
the
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
house
instead
of
on
one
side
of
it
or
make
any
changes
which
suit

fancy
the

of
the
house
may
be
ten
by
twelve
or
twenty
by
thirty
feet
a
camp
or
a
dwelling
the
main
point
is
to
finish
your
house
up
with
totems
as
shown
by
fig

then
tell
the
other
fellows
where
you

may

weather
will
tone
it
down
so
that
it
will
be
sufficiently
rustic
to

if
you
leave
the
bark

the
logs
a

will
rot
your

lay
up

when

have
reached

frame
your
roof
after
the
manner
shown
by
fig
or
any
of
the
other
methods
described
which
may
suit
your
fancy
or
convenience
but
in
this
case
we
use
the
susitna
form
for
the
end
plates
which
are
made
by
first
severing
the
root
of
a
tree
and
leaving
an
elbow

the

of
the
trunk
fig
this

and

heading
of

the

at
the

of

are
carved
to
represent
grotesque

fig
the
house
when
built
is
something
like
the
wyoming
olebo
fig
but
with
the
difference
which
will
appear
after
careful
inspection
of
the
diagram
the
wyoming
olebo
is
a
house
this
is
a
house
the
wyoming
olebo
has
a
roof
built
upon
a
modified
plan
of
a
kanuck
this
roof
is
built
on
the
american
plan
with
the
logs
continued
up
to
the
top
of
the
gable
as
are
those
in
the
olympic
fig
but
the
present
house
is
supposed
to
be
built
to
be
sure
it
is
made
of
rude
material
but
handled
in
a
very
neat
and
workmanlike
manner
great
care
must
be
used
in
notching
and
joining
the
logs
and
only
the
straightest
logs
which
can
be
had
should
be
used
for
the
walls
of
the
house
the
piazza
may
need
some
additional
supports
if
there
is
a
wide
front
to
the
house
but
with
a
narrow
front
half
log
puncheons
will
be
sufficiently
stiff
to
support
themselves
totems
the
most
difficult
part
about
these
descriptions
for
the
writer
is
where
he
attempts
to
tell
you
how
to
make
your
totems
but
remember
that
a
totem
in
order
to
have
a
totem
look
must
be
very
crude
and
amateurish
a
quality
that
the
reader
should
be
able
to
give
it
without
much
instruction
the
next
important
thing
is
that
when
you
make
one
side
of
a
head
be
it
a
snake
a
man
a
beast
or
a
bird
make
the
other
side
like
it
do
not
make
the
head
lopsided
make
both
sides
of
the
same
proportions
flatten
the
sides
of
the
end
of
the
log
enough
to
give
you
a
smooth
surface
then
sketch
the
profile
on
each
side
of
the
log
with
charcoal
or
chalk
carve
out
the
head
with
a
chisel
and
and
gouge
until
you
have
fashioned
it
into
the
shape
desired
in
order
to
do
this
the
end
of
the
log
should
be
free
from
the
ground
and
a
convenient
distance
above
it
the
carving
is
best
done
after
the
house
is
practically
finished
but
the
two
end
plates
had
better
be
carved
before
they
are
hoisted
into
place
when
you
carve
out
the
fig
or
the
log
had
better
be
put
on
an
elongated
sawbuck
arrangement
which
will
hold
it
free
from
the
ground
and
allow
one
to
turn
it
over
as
the
work
may
require
fig
represents
a
peeled
log
on
this
log
one
may
sketch
with
chalk
the
various
figures
here
represented
then
begin
by
notching
the
log
fig
according
to
the
notches
which
are
necessary
to
carve
out
the
totem
figs
and
show
different
views
of
the
same
totem
figures
fig
shows
how
to
make
a
variation
of
the
paint
your
totem
heads
and
figures

and

and
to
suit
your
fancy
the
more
startling
they
are
the
better
will
they
imitate
the
indian
totems
the
weather
will
eventually
tone
them
down
to
the
harmonious
colors

the
small
boys
who
started
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
are
older
and
more
experienced
now
and
even
if
they
can
not
handle
the
big
logs
themselves
they
are
perfectly
competent
to
teach
their
daddies
and
uncles
and
their
big
brothers
how
to
do
it
so
they
may
act
as
boss
builders
and
architects
and
let
the
older
men
do
the
heavy
work
but
however
you
proceed
to
build
this
house
when
it
is
finished
you
will
have
a
typically
native
building
and
at
the
same
time
different
from
all
others
as
quaint
as
any
bungling
bungalow
and
in
better
taste
because
it
will
fit
in
the
landscape
and
become
part
of
it
and
look
as
if
it
in
place
of
appearing
as
if
it
had
been
blown
by
a
tornado
from
some

could
ever
find
the

it
is
somewhere
among
the
tracks

the
long
island

they
had
double
doors

doors
which
were
cut
in
two
up
so
that
you
might
open
the
top

both
halves

suit
your
fancy
the

of
these

had
two

between
them
down
the
upper

was
a
great
brass
knocker
with
a
grip
big
enough
to
accommodate
both
hands
in
case
you
really
wanted
to
make
a
noise
there
was
another
house
of
this
same
description
in
the
outskirts
of
hoboken
and
i
often
wondered
what
the
origin
of
that
peculiar
roof
might
be
i
found
this
type
of
house
as
far
north
toward
the
hudson

as
the

go

still
farther
north

not
exactly
the

the

the
one
from

the
old
long
island
farmhouses
were
evolved
although
the
old
long
islanders
copied
theirs
from
the
homes
they
left
in
holland
but
we
must
remember
that
even
the
effete
civilization
of
europe
once
had
a
backwoods
country
a
long
long
time
ago
and
then
they
built
their
houses
from
the
timbers
hewn
in
the
forests
as
our
own
ancestors
did
in
this
country
consequently
many
of
the
characteristics
of
houses
which
seem
to
us
useless
and
unnecessary
are
survivals
of
the
necessary
characteristics
of
houses
made

crude
material
xlii
how
to
make
a
fireplace
and
chimney
for
a
simple
log
cabin
fig
shows
a
simple
form
of
fireplace
which
is
practically
the
granddaddy
of
all
the
other
fireplaces
it
consists
of
three
walls
for
windbreaks
laid
up
in
stone
or
sod
against
some
stakes
driven
in
the
ground
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
them
the
stakes
are
notched
or
forked
and
small
logs
are
laid
horizontally
in
these
forks
and
on
top
of
this
a
pyramidal
form
of
a
log
pen
is
built
of
small
logs
and
billets
and
this
answers
the
purpose
of
a
chimney
this
style
of
fireplace
is
adapted
to
use
in
camps
and
rude
shacks
like
those
shown
by
figs
and
also
for
the
most
primitive
log
cabins
but
when
we
make
a
real
log
house
we
usually
plan
to
have
a
more
elaborate
or
more
finished
fireplace
and
chimney
the
of
fig

shown
by
fig
mud
hearth
here
you
see
there
is
a
mud
hearth
a
wall
of
clay
plastered
over
the
stones
of
the
fireplace
this
will
prevent
the
fire
from
cracking
and
chipping
the
stones
but
clay
is
not
absolutely
necessary
in
this
fireplace
when
however
you
build
the
walls
of
your
fireplace
of
logs
and
your
chimney

sticks
the
clay
necessary
to
prevent
the
fire
from
igniting
the

and
consuming
it
for
a

make
a

logs
and
then
a
back
log
neatly
notched
so
as
to
look
like
the

in
the
walls
of
the

build
your
fireplace
walls
as
shown
by

after
which
take
your
mud
or
clay
and
make
the
hearth
by
hammering
the
clay
down
hard
until
you
have
a
firm
smooth
foundation
the
front
hearth
may
be
made
as
shown
in

of
stones
of
any
size
from
pebbles
to
flagstones
with
the
surfaces
levelled
by
sinking

make
the
clay
walls
of
the
fireplace
at
least
one
foot
thick
and
pack
it
down
hard
and
tight
as
you
build
it
if
you
choose
you
may
make
a
temporary
inside
wall
of
plank
as
they
do
when
they
make
cement
walls
and
then
between
the
temporary
board
wall
and
the
logs
put
in
your
moist
clay
and
ram
it
down
hard
until
the
top
of
the
fireplace
is
reached
after
which
the
boards
may
be
removed
and
the
inside
of
the

smoothed
off

wiping
it
with
a
wet
cloth

after
the

split
some
sticks
and
make
them
about
one
inch
wide

one
half

use
the
round
sticks
in
the
form
in
which
they
grow

peel
off
the

where
they
run

may
have
to
be
chinked
up
so
as
to
keep
them
level

the

should
be
built

as
it
has
four
sides
to
balance
it
leave

many
many
years

in

the

in

in

the

an
advance
and
improvement
upon
the
log
chimney
but
i
doubt
if
it
requires
any
more
skill
to
build

foundation
dig
your
foundation
for
your
fireplace
and
chimney
at
least
three
feet
deep
then
fill
the
hole
up
with
small
cobblestones
or
broken
bluestone
until
you
have
reached
nearly
the
level
of
the
ground
upon
this
you
can
begin
to
lay
your
hearth
and
chimney
foundation
if
you
fail
to
dig
this
foundation
the
frost
will
work
the
ground
under
your
chimney
and
the
chimney
will
work
with
the
ground
causing
it
either
to
upset
or
to
tilt
to
one
side
or
the
other
and
spoil
the
looks
of
your

in

remember
that

the
more

the

but
the

and
the

be
the
danger

fires
lay
your
stones
in
mortar
or
cement
see
that
each
stone
fits
firmly
in
the
bed
and
does
not
rock
and
that
it
breaks
joints
with
the
other
stone
below
it
by
breaking
joints
i
mean
that
the
crack
between
the
two
stones
on
the
upper
tier
should
fit
over
the
middle
of
the
stone
on
the
lower
tier
this
with
the
aid
of
the
cement
locks
the
stones
and
prevents
any
accidental
cracks
which
may
open
from
extending
any
further
than
the
two
stones
between
which
it
started
if
however
you
do
not
break
joints

might
run
from
the
top

the
bottom

it
to
fall

make
four

you
did
with

chimney
fig
and
let
the
top
of
the
chimney
extend
above
the
roof

three
feet

the

bars
these
iron
bars
are
necessary
for
safety
because
although
the
stone
may
bridge
the
fireplace
successfully
the
settling
of
the
chimney
or
the
heat

to
have
a
fireplace
in
the
middle
of
the
room
personally
such
a
fireplace
does
not
appeal
to
me
but
there
are
other
people
who
like
the
novelty
of
such
a
fireplace
and
fig

one
constructed
of
rough
stones
the
fireplace
is
high
so
that
one
tending
it
does
not
have
to
stoop
and
get
a
backache
the
foundation
should
be
built
in
the
ground
underneath
the
cabin
and
up
through
the
floor
a
flat
stone
covers
the
top
of
the
fireplace

fireplaces
and
the
art
of
tending
the
fire
one
of
my
readers
has
written
to
me
asking
what
to
do
about
a
fireplace
that
smokes
not
knowing
the
fireplace
in
question
i
can
not
prescribe
for
that
particular
invalid
but
i
have
a
long
acquaintance
with
many
fireplaces
that
smoke
and
fireplaces
that
do
not
in
other
words
healthy
fireplaces
with
a
good
digestion
and
diseased
fireplaces
functionally
wrong
with
poor
digestion
so
perhaps
the
easiest
way
to
answer
these
questions
is
to
describe
a
few
of
my
acquaintances
among
the
fireplaces
which
i
have
studied
there
is
an
old
fireplace
in
small
acres
binghamton
of
which
i
made
sketches
and
took
measurements
which
furnished
me
data
by
which
i
built
the
fireplaces
in
my
own
houses
in
binghamton
fireplaces
the
side
walls
are
on
an
angle
and
converge
toward
the
back
of
the
fireplace
as
in
fig
the
back
also
pitches
forward
as
in
fig
the
great
advantage
of
this
is
the
reflecting
of
more
heat
into
the
room
fig
shows
the
fireplace
before
which
i
am
now
working
the
fire
was
started
in
last
november
and
is
now
april
still
burning
although
it
has
not
been
rekindled
since
it
was
first
lighted
this
fireplace
is
well
constructed
and
on
very
cold
days
i
have
the
fire
burning
out
on
the
hearth
fully
a
foot
beyond
the
line
of
the

any

the

of

give
these
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
want
to
know
how
to
build
a
fireplace
which
will
not
smoke
but
of
course
even
the
best
of
fireplaces
will
smoke
if
the
fire
is
not
properly
arranged
with
smoke
the
angle
of
reflection
would
be
equal
to
the
angle
of
incidence
did
not
the
constant
tendency
of
smoke
to
ascend
modify
this
rule
throw
a
rubber
ball
against
the
wall
and
the
direction
from
your
hand
to
where
it
strikes

the
ball
bounces
away
from
the

but
before
we
enter
into
the
question
regarding
the
structure
of
the
flue
we
will
take
up
the
management
of
the
fire
itself
in
the
first
place
there
is
but
one
person
who
can
manage
a
fire
and
that
is
yourself
servants
never
did
and
never
will
learn
the
art
and
as
i
am
writing
for
men
and
the
ladies
are
not
supposed
to
read
this
article
i
will
state
that
the
fair
sex
show
a
like
deficiency
in
this
line
the
first
thing
a
woman
wants
to
do
with
a
fire
is
to
make
the
logs
roost
on
the
andirons
the
next
thing
is
to
remove
every
speck
of
ashes
from
the
hearth
and
then
she
wonders
why
the
fire
wo
burn
the
ashes
have
not
been
removed
from
my
studio
fire
since
it
was
first
lighted

and
to
keep

embers

the

in
my
studio

you
will
see
by
this
diagram
that
the
logs
are
not
resting
on
the
andirons
i
only
use
the
andirons
as
a
safeguard
to
keep
the
logs
from
rolling
out
on
the
hearth
if
the
fire
has
been
replenished
late
in
the
evening
with
a
fresh
log
before
retiring
i
pull
the
front
or
the
ornamental
parts
of
the
andirons
to
the
hearth
and
then
lay
the
shovel
and
poker
across
them
horizontally
when
the
burning
log
is
covered
with
ashes
and
the
andirons
arranged
in
this
manner
you
can
retire
at
night
with
a
feeling
of
security
and
the
knowledge
that
if
your
house
catches
afire
it
will
not
be
caused
by
the
embers
in
your
fireplace
then
in
the
morning
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
shovel
out
the
ashes
from
the
rear
of
the
fireplace
put
in
a
new
backlog
and
bed
it
in
with
ashes
as
shown
in

put
your
glowing
embers
next
to
the
backlog
and
your

wood
on

will
be
blazing

you

make
the
mistake
of
poking
a
with
the
idea
by
that
means
of
making
it
burn
more
briskly
or
boosting
up
the
logs
to
get
a
draught
under

two

the
building
of
the
log
house
how
a
pioneer
log
house
was
put
up
with
the
help
of
backwoods
farmers
making
plans
with
a
pocket
knife
our
log
house
on
the
shore
of
big
tink
pond
pike
county
was
built
long
before
the
general
public
had
been
educated
to
enjoy
the
subtle
charms
of
wild
nature
at
a
time
when
was
confined
to
scientists
and
children
and
long
before
it
was
fashionable
to
have
wild
fowl
on
one
lawn
and
wild
flowers
in
one
garden
at
that
time
only
a
few
unconventional
souls
spent
their
vacations
out
of
sight
of
summer
hotels
camping
on
the
mountain
or
forest
trails
the
present
state
of
the
public
mind
in
regard
to
outdoor
life
has
only
been
developed
within
the
last
few
years
and
when
i
first
announced
my
intention
of
hunting
up
some
accessible
wild
corner
and
there
erecting
a
log
house
for
a
summer
studio
and
home
i
found
only
unsympathetic
listeners
but
i
was
young
and
rash
at
that
time
and
without
any
previous
experience
in
building
or
the
aid
of
books
to
guide
me
and
with
only
such
help
as
i
could
find
among
backwoods
farmers
i
built
a
log
house
that
is
probably
the
pioneer
among
log
houses
erected
by
city
men
for
summer
homes
it
gave
charles
wingate
the
suggestions
from
which
he
evolved
twilight
park
in
the
catskills
twilight
park
being
the
resort
of
literary
people
and
their
friends
did
much
to
popularize
log
houses
with
city
people
the
deserted
farms
of
new
england
offer
charming
possibilities
for
those
whose
taste
is
for
nature
with
a
shave
hair
cut
and
store
clothes
but
for
lovers
of
untamed
nature
the
waste
lands
offer
stronger
inducements
for
days
and
there
is
no
building
which
fits
so
naturally
in
a
wild
landscape
as
a
good
log
cabin
it
looks
as
if
it
really
belonged
there
and
not
like
a
windfall
from
some
passing
whirlwind
when
i
make
the
claim
that
any
ordinary
man
can
build
himself
a
summer
home
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
will
not
make
blunders
and
plenty
of
them
only
fools
never
make
mistakes
wise
men
profit
by
them
and
the
reader
may
profit
by
mine
for
there
is
no
lack
of
them
in
our
log
house
at
big
tink
but
the
house
still
stands
on
the
bank
overlooking
the
lake
and
is
practically
as
sound
as
it
was
when
the
last
spike
was
driven
years
ago
almost
all
of
the
original
log
cabins
that
were
once
sprinkled
through
the
eastern
part
of
our
country
disappeared
with
the
advent
of
the
and
the
few
which
still
exist
in
the
northern
part
of
the
country
east
of
the
alleghany
mountains
would
not
be
recognized
as
log
houses
by
the
casual
observer
for
the
picturesque
log
exteriors
have
been
concealed
by
a
covering
of
clapboards
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
even
among
the
old
mountaineers
i
could
find
none
who
had
ever
attended
a
frolic
or
participated
in
the
erection
of
a
real
log
house
most
of
these
old
fellows
however
could
remember
living
in
such
houses
in
their
youth
but
they
could
not
understand
why
any
sane
man
of
wanted
to
waste
so
much
good
lumber
and
in
the
quaint
old
american
dialect
still
preserved
in
these
regions
they
explained
the
wastefulness
of
my
plans
and
pointed
out
to
me
the
number
of
good
planks
which
might
be
sawed
from
each

two
houses
under
one
roof
by
referring
to
fig
it
will
be
seen
that
above
the
gallery
there
is
a
portico
which
we
called
the
afterthought
because
it
did
not
appear
upon
the
original
plans
we
got
the
hint
as
jimmy
called
it
when
it
was
noticed
that
chance
had
ordained
that
the
two
logs
should
protrude
much
farther
than
the
others
do
saw
them
off
i
exclaimed
we
will
have
a
balcony
and
so
the
two
logs
were
left
and
this
gave
us
room
for
a
balcony
over
the
gallery
back
of
which
is
a
bedroom
while
the
two
large
bedrooms
on
each
side
have
doors
opening
on
the
passageway
which
is
made
still
broader
by
the
addition
of
the
balcony
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
a
stairway
marked
out
on
the
ground
plan
but
there
was
none
on
the
original
plan
for
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
did
not
know
where
to
put
the
stairs
until
the
logs
were
in
place
however
it
is
just
such
problems
that
lend
charm
to
the
work
of
building
your
own
house
an
architect
or
a
professional
builder
would
have
the
thing
all
cut
and
dried
beforehand
and
leave
nothing
to
chance
and
inspiration
this
takes
the
whole
charm
out
of
the
work
when
one
is
building
for
recreation
and
the
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
the
occupation
when
our
house
was
finished
we
had
no
shutters
to
the
windows
and
no
way
of
closing
up
the
open
ends
of
the
gallery
and
my
helpers
told
me
that
i
must
not
leave
the
house
that
way
because
stray
cattle
would
use
the
house
for
a
stable
and
break
the
windows
with
their
horns
as
they
swung
their
heads
to
drive
away
the
flies
so
we
nailed
boards
over
these
openings
when
we
closed
the
house
for
the
winter
later
we
invented
some
shutters
see
fig
which
can
be
put
up
with
little
trouble
and
in
a
few
moments
fig
shows
how
these
shutters
are
put
in
place
and
locked
on
the
inside
by
a
movable
sill
that
is
slid
up
against
the
bottom
of
the
shutters
and
fastened
in
place
by
iron
pins
let
into
holes
bored
for
the
purpose

of
course
this
forms
no

to
a

burglar
but
there
is
nothing
inside
to
tempt
cracksmen
and
these
professional
men
seldom
stray
into
the

the
shutters
serve
to
keep
out
cattle
small

is
a
healthy
wholesome
occupation

the
kind
necessary

people
of
sedentary
occupations

those
whose

the
same
day
in
when
the
writer
was
himself
a
bachelor
he
went
out
into
the
wilderness
on
the
shores
of
big
tink
pond
upon
which
he
built
the
log
house
shown
in
the
sketch
at
first
he
kept
bachelor
hall
there
with
some
choice
spirits
not
the
kind
you
find
in
bottles
on
the
shelf
but
the
human
kind
who
love
the
outdoor
world
and
nature
or
he
took
his
parents
and
near
relatives
with
him
for
a
vacation
in
the
woods
like
all
sensible
men
in
course
of
time
he
married
and
then
he
took
his
bride
out
to
the
cabin
in
the
woods
at
length
the
time
came
when
he
found
it
necessary
to
shoulder
his
axe
and
go
to
the
woods
to
secure
material
for
a
new
of
he
cut
the
young
peeled
them
and
with
them
constructed
a
crib
and
every
year
for
the
last
eight
years
that
crib
has
been
occupied
part
of
the
season
thus
you
see
a
camp
of
this
kind
becomes
hallowed
with
the
most
sacred
of
human
memories
and
becomes
a
joy

only
to
the

thereof

the

how
to
patch
a
shingle
roof
the
reader
must
not
suppose
that
the
roof
of
my
camp
was
made
of
flannel
because
it
shrank
for
the
whole
house
which
was
made
of
logs
diminished
in
size
as
the
wood
became
seasoned
so
that
now
each
log
averages
a
quarter
of
an
inch
less
in
width
than
it
did
when
the
house
was
built
twenty
odd
years
ago
there
are
just
one
hundred
logs
in
the
house
which
makes
the
house
inches
smaller
than
it
was
when
it
was
built
but
i
can
not
point
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
two
feet
and
one
inch
are
missing
neither
do
i
know
that
this
had
anything
to
do
with
the
opening
in
the
roof
about
the
chimney
but
i
do
know
that
the
opening
gradually
became
wider
and
wider
until
it
not
only
admitted
the
entrance
of
numerous
flying
squirrels
and
other
varmints
but
also
let
in
the
rain
and
snow
and
consequently
it
had
to
be
remedied
neither
the
flying
squirrels
nor
the
elements

at

camps
cement
is
not
always
handy
and
even
if
one
is
living
in
a
farmhouse
it
will
probably
necessitate
quite
a
long
drive
to
procure
it

however
there
happens
to
be
on

put

i
like
my

way

by

and
it
must
not
be
taken
for
granted
that
every
camp
or
farmhouse
has
a
supply
of
tin
washers
but
we
know
that
every
camp
and
farmhouse
does
have
a
supply
of
tin
cans
and
the
washers
may
be
made
from
these
as
shown
by
figs
and
knock
the
cans
apart
at
their
seams
and
cut
the
tin
up
into
pieces

these
pieces
in

so
as
to

place
them
on

wood

punch
holes
in
them
by
driving
a
wire
nail
through

will
have
better

than
those
you
can

handsome
patched
roofs

new

any
decent
shingled
roof
should
last
fifteen
years
without
repairing
and
many
of
them
last
nearly
twice
that
time
but
there
comes
a
time
when
the
roof
begins
to
leak
and
needs
mending
when
that
time
comes
with
your
whittle
a
number
of
little
wooden
pegs
or
splints
each
about
six
inches
long
and
a
little
thicker
than
a
with
which
to
mark
the
holes
go
up
in
the
attic
and
wherever
you
see
daylight
through
the
roof
push
through
the
hole
a
wooden
peg
to
mark
the
spot
then
when
you
have
finished
and
are
ready
to
climb
on
the
roof
take
off
your
shoes
put
on
a
pair
of
woollen
socks
and
there
will
be
little
danger
of
your
slipping
new

rubber
shoes
with
corrugated
soles
are
also
good
to
wear

that
the

drive
a

shingle
up
under

over
the
damaged
one
where
there
is
a
bad
place
in
the
roof
it
may
be
necessary
to
make
a
patch
of
a
number
of
shingles
like
the
one
shown
in
the
corner
of
fig
but
even
then
it
is
not
necessary
to
remove
the
old
shingles
unless
the
hole
is
very
large
these
patches
of
old
tin
or
new
shingles
do
not
look
handsome
on
an
old
roof
but
they
serve
their
purpose
in
keeping
out
the
rain
and
snow
and
preventing
moisture
from
rotting
the
timbers
the
weather
will
soon
tone
down
the
color
of
the
new
shingles
so
that
they
will
not
be
noticeable
and
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
having
a
dry
roof
over
your
head
there
is
only
one
thing
worse
than
a
leaky
roof
and
that
is
a
leaky
boat

patching
in
these
days
when
everybody
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
in

very
sensibly
using
it
to

a
farm

farmhouse
so
as
to
be
able
for
a
part
of
the
year
to
return
to
the
simple
life
of
our
ancestors
it
is
very
necessary
that
we
should
also
know
something
of
the
simple
economies
of
those
days
for
when
one
finds
oneself
out
on
a
farm
there
is
no
plumber
around
the
corner
and
no
tinsmith
on
the
next
block
whom
one
may
call
upon
to
repair
breaks
and
the
damage
done
by
time
and
weather
on
an
old
farmhouse
the
ordinary
man
under
these
conditions
is
helpless
but
some
are
inspired
by
novel
ideas
as
for
instance
the
man
who
mended
the
leaking

porous
plasters

much
more

and
just
as

if

extensions
of

do
not

to
replace
it
with

remember
that
most
of
the
modern
sheet
tin
is
made
by
modern
methods
and
its
life
is
not
an
extended
one
the
sheet
they
often
use
in

of
sheet
rapidly
disintegrates
and
such
a
roof
will
not
last
you
half

that
a
properly
patched
old

the

you
do

with
the
red
roof
paint
will
make
the
white
patches
the
same
color
as
the
surrounding
tin
and
effectually
conceal
them
do
not
forget
the
importance
of
carefully
going
over
your
roof
after
it
is
mended
and
make
sure
that
every
joint
is
properly
covered
tacked
and
thoroughly
coated
with
white
lead
cover
all

and
caps

a

run
through
the
tin
roofing
but
it
will
find
its
way
through

if
they
are
not
made
absolutely
tight
plumbing
after
i
had
finished
doctoring
up
the
kitchen
roof
of
my
farmhouse
i
discovered
that
the
from
the
kitchen
sink
had
a
nasty
leak
where
the
pipe
ran
through
the
cellar
of
course
there
was
no
plumber
handy
plumbers
do
not
live
in
farming
districts
so
it
was
up
to
me
and
my
helper
to
stop
the
leak
as
best
we
could
a
few
blows
on
the
lead
with
the
hammer
carefully
administered
almost
closed
the
hole
i
then
had
recourse
to
the
white
lead
which
i
had
been
using
on
the
kitchen
roof
and
i
daubed
the
pipe
with
paint
still
the
water
oozed
through
but
after
i
had
applied
a
strip
of
linen
to
the
leak
and
then
neatly
wrapped
it
round
and
painted
the
whole
of
it
with
white
lead
the
leak
was
effectually
stopped
and
the
pipe
is
apparently
as
good
now
six
years
after
the
mending
as
it
was
when
it
was
new
in
this
sort
of
work
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
the
white
lead
we
depend
upon
and
the
other
material
which
we
use
the
tin
and
the
rags
are
only
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
and
holding
the
white
lead
in
place
of
course
a
roof
may
be
mended
with
tar
but
that
is
always
unsightly
and
insists
upon
running
when
heated
by
a
hot
sun
besides
it
is
most
difficult
to
conceal
and
does
not
come
ready
for
use
like
white
lead
if
the
leak
happens
to
be
around
the
chimney
it
can
be
mended
by
bending
pieces
of
tin
up
against
the
chimney
according
to
the
diagram
shown
for
the
tar
paper
and
patent
roofings
figs
and
flashings
chimneys
walls
etc
lead
or
copper
is
best
for
flashings
but
in
case
metal
is
not
convenient
you
will
find
that
various
patent
roofing
materials
are
good
substitutes
run
the
strips
of
roofing
to
the
angle
formed
by
the
object
to
be
flashed
and
extend
the
same
up
the
object
three
or
four
inches
fasten
these
strips
to
the
roof
in
the
usual
way
or
by
nailing
cleats
of
wood
over
the
top
edges
leaks
in
tubs
barrels
and
tanks
used
about
the
farm
can
be
mended
with
rags
tin
and
white
lead
in
the
manner
described
for
the
roof
and
pipe
also
leaks
in
the
leaders
running
from
the
roof
may
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
but
if
you
must
get
new
leaders
for
your
house
by
no
means
replace
the
old
ones
with
tubes
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
galvanized
steel
and
galvanized
iron
by
its
appearance
the
steel
is
brighter
and
more
silvery
than
the
iron
but
my
experience
is
that
the
steel
will
last
only
two
or
three
years
sometimes
one
season
puts
steel
pipes
out
of
commission
whereas
galvanized
iron
will
last
indefinitely
after
having
three
sets
of
leaders
on
my
town
house
i
had
them
replaced
with
copper
leaders
for
although
the
expense
is
greater
i
have
found
it
more
economical
in
the
end
for
people
having
plenty
of
money
to
spend
on
their
country
houses
i
would
advise
the
use
of
copper
leaders
but
folks
of
limited
means
will
save
money
patching
up
the
old
tin
ones
or
old
galvanized
ones
instead
of
replacing
them
with
galvanized
steel
which
is
of
little
service
for
outdoor
wear
there
are
i
believe
only
a
few
firms
who
now
manufacture
galvanized
iron
but
your
architect
can
find
them
if
you
insist
upon
it
xlviii
how
to
make
a
concealed
log
cabin
inside
of
a
modern
house
it
was
because
the
writer
knew
that
a
great
many
men
and
all
the
boys
rebelled
against
the
conventionalities
and
restrictions
of
a
modern
house
that
he
first
invented
and
suggested
the
surprise
den
and
told
how
to
make
one
years
ago
in
the
magazine
since
that
article
appeared
the
idea
has
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
people
there
is
a
beautiful
one
in
toledo
where
the
writer
was
entertained
during
the
floods
and
doctor
root
of
hartford
has
even
a
better
one
in
his
home
in
that
yankee
city
fig
shows
a
rough
sketch
of
a
corner
of
doctor
root
surprise
den
which
he
calls
his
loggery
from
the
outside
of
the
house
there
is
no
indication
of
anything
upon
the
inside
that
may
not
be
found
in
any
conventional
dwelling
which
is
the
proper
way
to
build
the
surprise
den

and
are
sketches
made
as
suggestions
to
those
wishing
to
add
the
surprise
den
to
their
dwelling
to
fathers
and
mothers
having
sons
anywhere
from
twelve
to
thirty
years
of
age
it
is
almost
a
necessity
nowadays
to
give
these
boys
a
room
of
their
own
popularly
known
as
the
den
a
retreat
where
they
can
go
and
sit
in
a
chair
without
having
fancy
embroidered
tidies
adhere
to
their
coat
collars
where
they
can
lean
back
in
their
chairs
if
they
choose
with
no
danger
of
ruining
the
valuable
hepplewhite
or
breaking
the
claw
feet
off
a
rare
chippendale
a
place
where
they
can
relax
the
greater
the
contrast
between
this
room
and
the
rest
of
the
house
the
greater
will
be
the
enjoyment
derived
by
the
boys
to
whom
it
belongs
the
only
two
surprise
dens
which
i
have
personally
visited
are
the
pride
of
the
lives
of
two
gentlemen
who
are
both
long
past
the
years
generally
accorded
to
youth
but
both
of
them
are
still
boys
in
their
hearts
the
truth
is
a
surprise
den
appeals
to
any
man
with
romance
in
his
soul
and
the
more
grand
stately
and
formal
his
house
may
be
the
greater
will
the
contrast
be
and
the
greater
the
surprise
of
this
den
it
is
a
unique
idea
and
makes
a
delightful
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
house
as
well
as

remember
that

but
the

were
published
first
solely
for

the
reader
must
have
no
doubt
noticed
that
the
problems
in
this
book
have
become
more
and
more
difficult
as
we
approach
the
end
but
this
is
because
everything
grows
as
we
acquire
skill
we
naturally
seek
more
and
more
difficult
work
on
which
to
exercise
our
skill
these
gateways
however
are
none
of
them
too
difficult
for
the
boys
to
build
themselves
the
main
problem
to
overcome
in
building
the
picturesque
log
gateway
shown
by
fig
is
not
in
laying
up
the
logs
or
constructing
the
roof
the
reader
has
already
learned
how
to
do
both
in
the
forepart
of
this
book
but
it
is
in
so
laying
the
logs
that
the
slant
or
incline
on
the
two
outsides
will
be
exactly
the
same
also
in
so
building
the
sides
that
when
you
reach
the
top
of
the
open
way
and
place
your
first
overhead
log
the
log
will
be
exactly
horizontal
exactly
level
as
it
must
be
to
carry
out
the
plan
in
a
workmanlike
manner
fig
shows
you
the
framework
of
the
roof
the
of
which
is
a
plank
cut
that
is
lower
in
the
centre
than
at
either
end
the
frame
should
be
roofed
with
shingles
or
at
least
shingles
if
you
use
the
manufactured
article
of
commerce
this
gateway
is
appropriate
for
a
common
fence
or
any
of
the
log
fences
illustrated
in
the
previous
diagrams
fig
shows
how
the
fence
here
shown
is
constructed
the
logs
are
bevelled
to
fit
in
diagonally
the
and
logs
are
set
in
as
shown
by
the
dotted
line
in

a
gateway
like
the
one
shown
here
would
make
a
splendid
and
imposing
one
for
a
permanent
camp
whether
it
be
a
boy
scout
a
girl
pioneer
a
private
camp
for
boys

simply
the
entrance

a
large
private
