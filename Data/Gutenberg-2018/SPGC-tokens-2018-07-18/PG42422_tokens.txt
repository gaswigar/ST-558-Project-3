dedication
to
a
rapidly
disappearing
class
the
pioneer
prospectors
whose
bravery
intelligence
and
industry
blazed
the
trails
in
the
western
wilderness
for
advancing
civilization
and
made
possible
the
development
of
the
great
west
this
volume
is
very
respectfully
dedicated
oh
that
my
words
were
now
written
oh
that
they
were
inscribed
in
a
book
job
xix
books
have
from
time
immemorial
been
the
conservators
of
human
wisdom
the
repositories
of
information
the
mentors
of
youth
and
adolescence
the
counsellors
of
manhood
the
comfort
and
companionship
of
age
the
experience
of
an
individual
school
or
era
when
committed
to
book
form
becomes
the
common
property
of
all
succeeding
time
and
the
accumulated
knowledge
of
the
past
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
through
the
medium
of
books
may
with
justice
be
regarded
as
the
most
valuable
of
human
heritages
but
they
have
not
always
been
unmixed
blessings
they
have
both
led
and
misled
they
have
elucidated
yet
have
mystified
they
have
dissipated
the
shadows
of
ignorance
and
superstition
but
in
some
instances
have
confused
and
obscured
the
searchlight
of
truth
in
the
economy
of
human
affairs
books
have
been
factors
of
no
small
importance
they
have
proved
the
most
potent
expositors
of
iniquitous
systems
and
when
properly
directed
against
crying
evils
have
accomplished
speedy
reforms
they
have
precipitated
wars
incited
revolts
and
seditions
in
the
cause
of
progress
yet
have
intensified
prejudice
political
religious
and
racial
with
silent
eloquence
they
have
cried
out
against
the
wrongs
of
those
who
had
none
to
plead
their
cause
while
in
other
cases
their
influence
has
tended
to
perpetuate
existing
abuses
in
some
instances
they
have
taught
men
to
be
content
with
servitude
in
others
have
ignited
the
beacon
fires
of
liberty
though
they
are
usually
found
enlisted
under
the
banners
of
justice
yet
no
cause
has
ever
been
so
unworthy
and
no
institution
so
unholy
that
books
have
not
been
written
in
their
defence
in
verity
they
have
sown
both
wheat
and
tares
books
have
been
written
on
every
conceivable
subject
under
all
conditions
by
all
sorts
of
writers
and
from
an
endless
variety
of
motives
the
recompense
of
those
who
have
written
them
has
been
equally
various
some
have
been
apotheosized
and
worshipped
others
have
been
the
recipients
of
orders
and
decorations
of
honor
at
the
hands
of
kings
and
potentates
while
others
have
received
the
ovations
of
admiring
multitudes
some
have
anonymously
contributed
their
mite
toward
the
enrichment
of
literature
others
have
appeared
from
whence
we
know
not
and
after
placing
their
offerings
upon
the
altars
of
poesy
and
art
have
departed
unrewarded
into
the
shadows
of
obscurity
leaving
as
footprints
innumerable
quotations
which
have
become
proverbial
some
as
the
bards
and
minnesingers
of
old
who
in
medi√¶val
castles
ate
their
bread
by
the
sufferance
of
the
feudal
lords
and
barons
have
in
more
recent
years
been
dependent
upon
the
bounty
of
some
munificent
and
usually
titled
patron
to
whom
they
as
a
matter
of
policy
dedicated
their
strains
and
panegyrics
consequently
wielding
mercenary
pens
some
who
have
presumed
to
write
in
a
manner
displeasing
to
those
who
sat
in
high
places
have
met
with
vilification
exile
imprisonment
decapitation
and
have
not
been
strangers
to
the
pillory
criticism
and
ridicule
are
the
patent
rewards
of
incipient
authorship
while
want
neglect
and
starvation
have
terminated
the
career
of
more
than
one
name
afterwards
great
in
the
world
of
letters
aside
from
motives
common
to
all
who
with
reverent
steps
humbly
strive
to
follow
where
the
great
lights
of
poesy
have
led
the
author
of
these
unpretentious
pages
has
been
actuated
by
a
desire
to
portray
in
his
correct
light
a
very
frequently
misrepresented
character
viz
the
pioneer
prospector
it
has
long
been
customary
for
writers
of
western
fiction
to
picture
this
character
as
a
but
rough
and
untutored
individual
expressing
himself
in
a
vernacular
consisting
of
equal
parts
of
slang
profanity
and
questionable
grammar
possessing
no
ambitions
above
the
card
table
or
the
strong
waters
which
cause
all
men
to
err
who
drink
them
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
this
class
extending
from
the
years
of
infancy
to
middle
age
convinces
the
writer
that
the
common
description
is
manifestly
unjust
and
misleading
the
men
who
flocked
to
the
early
gold
excitements
and
who
subsequently
prospected
the
western
mountain
ranges
for
their
hidden
wealth
were
the
cream
of
american
and
european
manhood
men
possessed
of
more
than
ordinary
endowments
of
intellect
education
and
physique
while
their
industry
bravery
and
hardihood
have
never
been
questioned
proof
of
this
exists
in
the
names
which
have
lingered
behind
them
as
a
matter
of
record
for
it
was
the
prospector
who
christened
the
mountains
gulches
and
mining
locations
of
the
west
a
cursory
perusal
of
the
maps
of
mineral
surveys
in
any
western
mining
district
will
reveal
in
abundance
such
names
as
hector
ajax
golden
fleece
atlas
pegasus
etc
indicating
that
those
who
applied
them
were
if
not
college
graduates
men
not
unfamiliar
with
the
classics
the
use
of
such
names
as
cleopatra
crusader
or
magna
charta
by
a
prospector
unversed
in
history
would
naturally
be
unexpected
one
without
knowledge
of
literature
would
hardly
grace
his
location
stakes
with
such
names
as
dante
hamlet
or
mephistopheles
while
one
entirely
unlettered
could
not
by
chance
hit
upon
such
names
as
pandora
medusa
or
sesostris
of
the
pioneer
prospectors
but
few
remain
many
have
fallen
asleep
others
tiring
of
the
privation
and
uncertainty
incident
to
a
life
are
pursuing
other
vocations
while
many
have
become
prosperous
ranch
and
and
may
now
be
found
in
almost
any
western
valley
a
few
a
very
few
in
comparison
with
the
less
fortunate
majority
acquiring
a
competence
removed
to
other
localities
and
in
not
a
few
instances
have
become
conspicuous
figures
in
the
world
of
business
politics
and
finance
in
the
mountainous
districts
of
the
west
you
may
still
occasionally
see
a
veteran
prospector
of
the
old
school
living
the
life
of
a
hermit
in
his
log
cabin
situated
in
some
picturesque
park
or
gulch
near
his
sometimes
valuable
but
more
frequently
worthless
mining
locations
there
he
lives
winter
and
summer
his
only
companion
a
cat
or
dog
the
ambitions
of
his
youth
still
unrealized
but
at
three
score
and
ten
hopeful
and
expectant
his
bent
form
white
hair
and
venerable
bearing
impress
you
strangely
at
first
but
it
is
only
when
you
overcome
the
reticence
peculiar
to
those
who
have
long
dwelt
in
solitude
and
engage
him
in
conversation
that
his
mental
status
becomes
apparent
to
your
surprise
you
discover
that
he
can
converse
entertainingly
on
any
subject
from
the
mosaic
dispensation
to
the
latest
inventions
in
the
world
of
mechanism
you
may
find
him
to
be
not
only
a
shakspearean
scholar
but
a
deep
student
of
that
volume
which
whether
considered
from
a
sacred
or
secular
point
of
view
stands
preeminently
forth
as
the
book
of
books
you
may
find
him
able
to
translate
homer
or
virgil
and
that
the
masterpieces
of
literature
are
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
own
cabin
walls
a
glimpse
at
the
interior
of
his
cabin
discloses
an
ample
stock
of
newspapers
and
magazines
while
books
are
not
strangers
there
is
something
pathetic
about
his
loneliness
you
leave
him
with
the
feeling
that
society
has
been
the
loser
by
his
voluntary
banishment
and
are
reminded
of
immortal
lines
full
many
a
gem
of
purest
ray
serene
the
dark
unfathomed
caves
of
ocean
bear
full
many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen
and
waste
its
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
you
speculate
upon
the
story
of
his
life
for
you
feel
that
it
has
a
secret
if
not
a
tragedy
connected
with
it
into
which
you
may
not
probe
you
ask
yourself
the
question
has
not
his
life
been
wasted
and
if
he
alone
is
to
be
considered
there
is
none
but
an
affirmative
answer
but
his
life
has
not
been
barren
of
results
he
has
been
a
contributory
factor
in
the
upbuilding
of
an
empire
for
he
is
one
of
the
class
who
laid
the
foundations
of
western
prosperity
these
men
came
west
for
various
reasons
some
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
adventure
some
to
acquire
fortunes
or
to
retrieve
vanished
ones
others
possibly
to
outlive
the
stigma
of
youthful
mistakes
in
the
lives
of
many
of
them
are

when
the
stellar
beacons
failed
a
darkness
unrelieved
prevailed
out
of
the
ambient

of

bereft
of
its
accustomed
bloom
came
comfortless
and
gray
sped
the
nocturnal
shades
away
unveiling
with
their
winged
retreat
a
twilight
sad
and
incomplete
reluctantly
as

aspired

retired
as

armies
often

spun

silvery
web
of

ominous
and
gray
obscured

glories
of

such
was
the
dreary
winter
day
which
dawned
with
dull
and
leaden
sky
no
cheerful
penetrating
ray
flashed
from
the
sun
resplendent
eye
in
vain
through
rift
and
orifice
he
strove
with
radiant
beam
to
kiss
each
mountain
peak
and

height
apparelled
in
their
garbs
of
white
and

each
brow
so
bleak
and
cold
with
burnished
diadem
of

ascending
in

flight

the
canopy

of

as
through

feeble
outline
met
the
gaze
this
faded
till
his
glowing
face
left
no
suggestive
spot
or
trace
no
corollary
on
the
pall
which
settled
and
pervaded
all
as
stormy
cowls
their
summits
hid
in
turret
tower
and
pyramid
of
stately
and
majestic
mien
was
nature

from
yawning
chasm

minaret
and

carved
by
the
tireless
hand
of

in
forms
fantastic
yet
sublime

impregnable

profiled
on
the
lowering
sky

the
tremendous
height
of
brother
peaks
on
left
and
right
in
his
commanding
station
placed
the
giant
of
the
rocky
waste
with
aspect
stood
the
sentry
of
the
solitude
guarding
the
mountainous
expanse
with
his
imposing
battlements
in
armor
panoplied
with
rugged
walls
on
every
side
beseamed
with
countless
scars
and

from
combat
with

towered
with
mute
and
massive
form
a
challenge
to
the
gathering
storm
this
overshadowing
mountain
peak
in
solemn
silence
seemed
to
speak
a
prophecy
of
arctic
doom
as
in
his
frigid
splendor
dressed
he
reared
aloft
his
frozen
crest
surmounted
by
a
snowy
plume
his
wrinkled
and
forbidding
brow
a
sombre
shadow
seemed
to
throw
other
crags
as
wild
and
stern
which
frowned
defiance
in
return
the
wind
lugubrious
and
sad
in
doleful
accents
soft
and
low
mourned
through
the
dismal
forests
clad
in
weird
habiliments
of
snow
as
if
forsooth
the
sylvan
ghosts
had
mobilized
in
pallid
hosts
to
haunt
their
rugged
solitudes
the
spectres
of
departed
woods
and
with
uninterrupted
flow
the
streamlet
underneath
the
snow
answered
the
wind
despondent
moan
with
plaint
of
gurgling
monotone
or
locked
in
winter
stern
embrace
no
longer
trickled
in
its
bed
but
found
a
frigid
resting
place
in
stationary
ice
instead
the
crystal
snowflakes
gently
fell
enrobing
mountain
plain
and
dell
in
mantle
spotless
and
complete
as
nature
in
her
winding
sheet
layer
upon
layer
fell
fast
and
deep
till
every
cliff
abrupt
and
steep
was
crowned
with
coronal
of
white
capricious
gusts
which
whirl
and
sift
built
comb
and
overhanging
drift
from
feathery
flakes
so
soft
and
light
more
thickly
flew
the
snow
and
fast
the
wind
developed
and
the
blast
soon
churned
the
tempest
till
the
air
seemed
but
a
white
and
whirling
glare
through
which
the
penetrating
eye
no
shape
nor
contour
might
descry
the
poor
belated
traveller
who
braved
the
rigor
of
that
day
might
thank
his
bright
protecting
star
if
orbs
of
pure
celestial
ray
far
in
the
scintillating
skies
preside
human
destinies
that
he
bewildered
and
distressed
had
warded
off
exhaustion
rest
and
in
that
maze
of
pine
and
fir
escaped
an
icy
sepulchre
when
driving
snows
accumulate
they
yield
to
the
tremendous
weight
and
down
the
mountain
rugged
sides
the
mass
with
great
momentum
slides
cleaving
the
fragile
spruce
and
pine
which
stand
in
its
line
as
bearded
grain
mature
and
lithe
goes
down
before
the
reaper
scythe
or
when
the
cyclone
baleful
force
in
flood
of
atmospheric
wrath
pursues
its
devastating
course
leaving
but
ruin
in
its
path
despoiling
in
a
moment

the
most
exalted
works
of
man
or
waters
suddenly
set
free
when
some
black
thunder
cloud
is
rent
rush
down
a
wild
declivity
with
irresistible
descent
depositing
on
every
hand
a
layer
of
sediment
and
sand
with
swift
and
spoliating
flow
uprooting
many
a
noble
tree
to
strew
the
desert
wastes
below
with
scattered
and
debris
such
is
the
dreadful
avalanche
which
rends
the
forest
root
and
branch
from
dangers
in
such
varied
form
and
the
discomforts
of
the
storm
small
wonder
was
the
mountaineer
left
not
his
fireside
ruddy
cheer
but
from
behind
the
bolted
door
discerned
the
tempest
strident
roar
or
heard
the
pendent
icicle
which
from
the
eaves
in
fragments
fell
as
some
more
formidable
blast
in
paroxysmal
fury
passed
it
shook
with
intermittent
throes
of
boisterous
spasmodic
power
a
most
substantial
hut
which
rose
as
summer
breeze
sways
grass
or
flower
and
the
dull
immobile
ground
trembled
in
sympathy
profound
such
was
the
fury
of
the
storm
as
if
the
crystal
flakes
had
met

militating
hosts
to
swarm
in
siege
about
its
parapet
when
every
rampant
onslaught
failed
the
blast
in
wanton
frenzy
wailed
as
if
with
unspent
rage
the
wind
felt
much
disgruntled
and
chagrined
and
though
of
nugatory
force
could
vent
its
spleen
with
accents
hoarse
as
some
beleaguered
tower
of
old
besieged
by
warriors
stern
and
bold
who
dashed
against
its
walls
of
stone
which
were
not
swayed
nor
overthrown
as
vicious
strokes
delivered
well
innocuous
and
futile
fell
then
watched
the
walls
withstand
the
strain
and
cursed
and
gnashed
their
teeth
in
vain
beneath
a
massive
pinnacle
whose
weird
forbidding
shadows
fell
and
gulch
and
forest
overcast
with
mantle
ominous
and
vast
nestling

this

cabin
quaint
and
rude
from
the
surrounding
forest
hewed
with
primitive

form
withstood
the
onslaught
of
the
storm
and
at
the
entrance
of
a
dell
stood
as
a
rustic
sentinel
beneath
a
pine
protecting
skirt
it
reared
its
modest
roof
of
poles
laid
close
then
overlaid
with
dirt
to
cover
up
the
cracks
and
holes
the
intervals
between
the
logs

daubed
with
mud
from
mountain
bogs
the
ground
did
service
as
a
floor
in
this
as
many
huts
before
so
beaten
down
beneath
the
tread
it
more
resembled
tile
instead
the
plastic
clay
compressed
and
sleek
was
level
and
as
hard
as
brick
protruding
boulders
smooth
and
bare
exposed
their
faces
here
and
there
and
with
their
surfaces
displayed
a
primitive
mosaic
made
and
terminating
in
a
stack
some
feet
above
the

the
fireplace

and
black
arose

object
of

express
the
reason
why
in

prime
i
left
a

sought

gentle

do
expect
a
tale
in
mongrel
dialect
for
uncle
jim

james
hale
who
lived
as
anchorite

monk
once
led
the
senior

at

had
his

in

leaped

gyrations
played
around
the
logs
of
hemlock
dry

with
the
tempest
seethed
and
swayed
as
curled
the
drowsy
wreaths
of

above

the
old
man
spoke
was
on
a
day
about
like
this
when
fresh
from
youthful
haunts
and
scenes
i
first
beheld
yon
precipice
and
sought
these
gulches
and
ravines
to
pan
despite
the
frost
and
cold
for
shining
particles
of
gold
and
hewed
the
rocker
and
the
sluice
from
out
the
native
pine
and
spruce
arrayed
in
nature
pristine
dress
this
was
indeed
a
wilderness

ever
viewed

more
forbidding

my
simple
tale
goes
back
to
a

england
vale
it
is
though
simple
tale
it
be
a

unwritten
tragedy
a
story
with
few
incidents

many
years
of
penitence
as
one
for

foul
crime
pursued
doth
flee
in
frenzy
rash

blind
to
wilderness

solitude
i
fled
to

both
fair

true
just
where
it

for

ere

crept
around

such
as

from

to
colossal
size

the

rumor
or
the

may
be
discredited
at
first

oft
repeated

received
is
soon
unconsciously
believed
though
inconsistent
and
abstract
fanned
by
insinuating
tongues
imaginary
faults
and
wrongs
soon
gain
the
currency
of

the
purest

misconstrued
by
the
lascivious
and
lewd
and
envy
loves
to
lie
in
wait
with
fangs
imbrued
in
venomed
hate
this
slander
born
of
jealousy
was
told
as
solemn
truth
to
me
by
tongues
i
deemed
immaculate
alas
that
shafts
from
falsehood
bow
should
undetected
cleave
the
air
or
wanton
hands
in
malice
sow
the
tares
of
discord
and
despair
for
every
seed
of
falsehood
sown
brings
forth
a
harvest
of
its
own
and
ears
most
ready
to
believe
are
difficult
to
undeceive
alas
that
shafts
from
falsehood
tongue
should
fall
suspicious
ears
among
and
be
received
and
nursed
forsooth
as
arrows
of
unblemished
truth
maligning
spotless
innocence
with
grave
impeachments
of
offence
their
crime
of
heinous
crimes
the
worst
with
multiplied
damnation
cursed
who
lost
to
every
sense
of
shame
assassinate
a
woman
name
for
such
with
calumnies
would
drag
an
angel
from
the
skies
and
stain
its
vestal
robes
of
white
with
slander
sable
hues
of
night
holding
to
ridicule
and
shame
the
ruins
of
a
once
fair

who
so
from

chalice
sips
may
greet
you

the

field
the
rankest
poisons
often
yield
and
falsehood
loves
to
hide
her
tooth
the
habiliments
of

this
scandal
venomous
and
vile
had
no
foundation
but
a
smile
but
on
it
wagging
tongues
had
built
a
massive
pyramid
of
guilt
in
evil
hour
i
too
believed
for
fabrications
more
absurd
than
the
aspersions
i
had
heard
have
wiser
ears
than
mine
deceived
i
fought
suspicion
vainly
tried
to
cast
each
rising
doubt
aside
but
he
who
lists
to
tales
of
ill
believes
in
part
despite
his
will
then
in
my
face
as
in
a
book
she
read
one
sad
distrustful
look
a
look
of
pity
yet
of
doubt
for
silence
cries
most
loudly
out
and
who
can
smile
with
visage
bright
to
shield
misgivings
black
as
night
unhappy
trait
that
in
us
lies
we
doubt
the
verdict
of
our
eyes
we
doubt
each
faculty
and
sense
yet
credit
sham
and
false
pretence
we
question
truth
and
much
prefer
to
list
to
falsehood
than
to
her
and
that
which
most
substantial
seems
we
doubt
yet
place
our
faith
in
dreams
we
doubt
the
pearl
of
purest
white
we
doubt
the
diamond
clear
and
bright
and
yet
accept
the
base
and
flawed
yes
revel
in
all
forms
of
fraud
that
moment
lack
of
confidence
the
shadow
of
remote
offence
cost
each
the
sweetest
joys
of
life
cost
her
a
husband
me
a
wife
ere
yet
that
month
its
course
had
spent
in
time
continuous
descent
her
face
had
been
forever
hid
beneath
the
sod
and
coffin
lid
then
slanderous
tongues
forgot
their
lies
and
wagged
in
glowing
eulogies
though
tears
the
pearls
of
sorrow
be
and
many
her
grave
were
shed
mine
was
a
tearless
agony
a
deeper
grief
instead
that
rumor
void
of
fact
or
proof
too
late
betrayed
the
cloven
hoof
too
late
alas
was
given
me
to
recognize
its
falsity
within
a
rural
burial
place
a
rude
though
quaint
necropolis
where
through
the
growth
of
hemlock
trees
is
borne
the
requiem
of
the
breeze
where
stand
the
funeral
pines
as
plumes
above
the
scattered
graves
and
tombs
and
sigh
with
drooping
branches
spread
in
sylvan
dirges
for
the
dead
beneath
a
fir
tree
sombre
shade
my
last
adieu
to
her
was
made
close
by
the
slab
of
graven
stone
which
marks
her
place
of
silent
rest
i
knelt
at
midnight
and
alone
then
rose
and
started
for
the
west
the
wind
in
temporary
lull
had
dwindled
to
a
plaintive
moan
as
if
in
mournful
monotone
her
cup
of
anguish
being
full
sad
nature
of
bale
had
overflowed
with
plaint
and
wail
in
palpitating
throbs
of
woe
it
now
arose
and
whirled
the
snow
with
triple
energy
renewed
filling
the
dismal
solitude
with
woeful
shriekings
of
despair
as
demon
orgies
in
the
air
and
culminated
in
a
roar
more
violent
than
aught
before
at
length
another
timely
lull
made
human
voices
audible
as
uncle
jim
resumed
his
seat
a
voice
cried
out
for
russian
pete
iii
the
prisoner
of
russian
pete
but
little
had
been
known
he
liked
to
read
and
be
so
much
alone
no
more
his
close
associates
could
tell
save
that
he
spoke
the
english
language
well
about
this
stranger
with
the
clever
tongue
an
air
of
mystery
and
sadness
clung
his
name
so
long
and
unpronounceable
which
none
could
frame
much
less
presume
to
spell
waiving
abridgment
partial
or
complete
was
by
the
boys
transformed
to
russian
pete
now
russian
pete
was
tall
and
strong
of
limb
nor
more
than
half
as
old
as
uncle
jim
of
noble
stature
and
commanding
brow
with
knees
which
in
no
genuflections
bow
his
face
was
sad
the
index
of
a
breast
where
memory
fires
were
raging
unsuppressed
with
eyes
which
search
in
closest
scrutiny
nor
yet
offend
the
object
they
would
see
one
who
from
feature
act
and
equipoise
had
known
life
sorrows
better
than
its
joys
a
man
whom
you
would
notice
in
the
street
and
know
the
second
time
if
you
should
meet
this
man
of
mystery
and
intellect
arose
and
stood
in
manhood
poise
erect
in
tone
of
voice
so
musical
and
clear
it
might
have
charmed
the
most
exacting
ear
and
wealth
of
language
few
can
hope
to
reach
nor
trace
of
foreign
accent
in
his
speech
he
forthwith
spake
my
simple
tale
shall
be
not
one
of
love
but
dire
captivity
like
uncle
jim
however
it
contains
the
cause
why
i
forsook
my
native
plains
no
tender
web
of
sentiment
but
one
by
treachery
and
machination
spun
across
the
sea
in
distant
realms
afar
in
the
remote
dominions
of
the
czar
past
where
the
dnieper
rolls
his
murky
flood
surcharged
with
fertilizing
silt
and
mud
past
the
dark
forests
and
productive
plains
which
he
with
many
a
tributary
drains
within
that
city
whose
inhabitants
with
flaming
torch
withstood
the
arms
of
france
preferring
ruin
to
the
victor
boast
or
occupation
by
an
alien
host
fair
moscow
which
became
a
funeral
pyre
and
perished
in
her
fire
that
her
invaders
chilled
by
snow
and
sleet
might
sink
in
irretrievable
defeat
a
few
years
since
the
date
concerns
us
not
a
minor
detail
readily
forgot
beneath
the
shadow
of
her
noblest
spire
there
dwelt
two
students
children
of
one
sire
with
prospects
fair
at
manhood
budding
edge
in
caste
esteemed
of
no
base
parentage
two
students
versed
in
languages
and
planned
for
consul
service
in
a
distant
land
as
foreign
usages
are
studied
most
when
one
aspires
to
diplomatic
post
thus
eagerly
did
we
acquire
the
tongue
of
you
whom
i
address
and
live
among
with
lucubrations
diligent
we
sought
our
ways
up
varied
avenues
of
thought
until
by
prejudice
no
longer
bound
we
stood
at
last
upon
dissenting
ground
or
wavered
where
reluctant
doubts
confuse
in
that
strange
zone
of
ruminating
views
where
progress
and
established
custom
meet
yes
crossed
its
boundaries
with
reckless
feet
in
that
stern
empire
on
disruption
brink
some
things
you
may
and
some
you
may
not
think
express
yourself
and
instantly
disgraced
your
steps
may
point
toward
a
siberian
waste
your
substance
confiscated
by
a
court
where
equity
is
but
a
theme
for
sport
extol
your
theories
proffer
your
advice
and
chains
or
banishment
may
be
the
price
for
despot
hands
since
might
initial
sway
have
fashioned
chains
for
worthier
hands
than
they
and
oftentimes
beneath
the
tyrant
heel
are
crushed
the
lives
which
strive
for
human
weal
who
dare
to
hold
the
gonfalon
aloft
for
human
rights
and
progress
yes
how
oft
since
cain
that
fratricidal
murder
wrought
have
death
and
durance
been
the
price
of

he
who
espouses

the

when

the

breakers
dash
to
martyrdom
perhaps
in

enthusiastic
heat
we
may
have
been
a
little
indiscreet
when
we
thus
inexperienced
and
young
against
oppression
dared
to
raise
the
tongue
perhaps
best
to
tarnish
manhood
brow
with
servile
adulation
and
to
bow
with
craven
salaam
and
obeisance
down
in
sycophantic
homage
to
a
crown
what
though
the

its

groans
and

what

page
three
days
were
we
in
custody
detained
in
stern
abeyance
formally
constrained
within
a
court
where
no
protesting
word
from

or
counsel
may
be
heard
a
court
where
no

eloquence
may
quash
the
allegations
of

our
doom
was
sealed
by
a
capricious
judge
who
thereby
satisfied
a
family
grudge
the
sentence
passed
the
stalwart
cossack
guard
straightway
transferred
us
to
a
prison
yard
there
parted
we
before
its
grated
door
they
dragged
him
in
and
he
was
seen
no
more
another
door
with
dull
metallic
sound
was
closed
and
i
was
hurried
underground
through
labyrinth
of
passages
and
halls
past
dingy
arches
and
protruding
walls
where
gloom
perpetual
the
eye
obscures
through
damp
recesses
nooks
and
apertures
with
foul
effluvia
and
odors
filled
by
darkness
dampness
and
decay
distilled
for
noisome
vapors

in
cavern
depths

and
generate
in

warmth
or

the
loathsome
mildew
and
corrupting
mould
at
length
through
cruel
maze
of
grate
and
stone
by
paths
circuitous
and
ways
unknown
we
reached
the
cell
as
hideous
a
den
as
ever
held
unwilling
beasts
or
men
and
soon
with
manacles
securely
bound
myself
its
only
occupant
i
found
a
dungeon
dimly
lighted
and
obscure
with
pools
of
water
stagnant
and
impure
whose
noxious
exhalations
permeate
the
deadened
air
which
could
not
circulate
and
laden
with
malignant
slime
and
ooze
upon
the
walls
discharged
in
baneful
dews
or
else
precipitate
with
vapory
loss
enrobed
the
cruel
stones
with
pendent
moss
and
water
foul
as
offended
lip
fell
from
the
roof
with
intermittent
drip
remote
from
daylight
dismal
and
unsunned
decompositions
stored
a
teeming
fund
of
molecules
and
organisms
strange
in
an
invisible
but
constant
change
as
stagnant
waters
generate
a
froth
these
with
spontaneous
and
fungous
growth
had
draped
the
dungeon
limited
expanse
with
toadstool
bulb
and
foul
protuberance
these
from
the
air
its
milder
virtues
drank
supplanting
ichors
venemous
and
dank
whose
essence
deleterious
the
while
exudes
in
savors
and
miasmas
vile
high
on
the
wall
a
slit
a
slender
ray
of
sunshine
would
admit
on
pleasant
mornings
when
the
sky
was
clear
from
leaden
fogs
and
hazy
atmosphere
a
ray
of
sunlight
yes
a
welcome
ray
a
wholesome
beam
but
just
too
far
away
although
i
tugged
at
the
remorseless
chain
and
strove
to
reach
that
sunbeam
was
in
vain
the
lambent
gleam
which
broke
into
the
cell
alone
on
toad
and
savage
rodent
fell
in
vain
i
wrenched
the
manacles
in
vain
i
sought
to
rend
the
cruel
gyves
in
twain
strove
with
contortions
painful
and
extreme
to
lay
my
head
within
this
gladsome
beam
or
even
touch
it
with
the
in
vain
no
galling
chain
relaxed
its
grip
a
ray
of
sunlight
just
beyond
my
reach
like
tantalus
as
ancient
classics
teach
when
for
duplicity
and
theft
immersed
in
rippling
waters
doomed
to
ceaseless
thirst
for
as
his
parching
lips
essayed
to
drink
the
mocking
waters
would
recede
or
sink
though
luscious
fruits
hung
pendent
in
his
sight
to
coax
the
palate
and
the
appetite
his
hand
reached
forth
with
eager
thrust
those
selfsame
fruits
resolved
to
baleful
dust
that
sunbeam
though
an
aggravation
fair
still
closed
the
floodgates
of
complete
despair
as
dykes
constrain
in
distant
lowland
realms
the
deluge
which
engulfs
and
overwhelms
with
final
resource
and
expedient
and
all
her
vials
of
expectation
spent
fate
in
her
changeable
kaleidoscope
evolves
new
turns
to
re√´stablish
hope
that
ray
of
sunshine
as
an
angel
smile
beaming
in
love
amid
surroundings
vile
came
morn
by
morn
to
mitigate
and
bless
a
benediction
in
my
bitterness
time
after
time
when
the
approaching
night
had
banished
every
modicum
of
light
and
clothed
each
outline
with
her
sable
guise
i
watched
the
greenish
glow
of
reptile
eyes
nor
dared
to
slumber
till
exhaustion
sleep
benumbed
my
senses
with
its
stupors
deep
then
conjured
by
the
witcheries
of
night
came
pleasant
dreams
and
visions
of
delight
those
iridescent
phantasies
of
air
which
mock
the
troubled
breast
in
its
despair
then
waking
the
delusive
phantoms
flown
a
prisoner
upon
a
floor
of
stone
my
fare
was
still
the
captive
mouldy
crust
my
chains
still
reeked
with
clotted
gore
and
rust
the
rigid
shackles
still
retained
their
clutch
and
clammy
walls
repulsed
the
friendly
touch
day
after
day
besmeared
with
filth
and
slime
in
foul
monotony
i
passed
the
time
battling
with
vermin
foes
a
teeming
brood
prolific
and
not
easily
withstood
an
evil
pest
ubiquitous
and
rife
in
the
fecundity
of
insect
life
in
agony
of
body
and
of
brain
each
breath
a
stifling
gasp
and
twinge
of
pain
cursing
my
fortune
though
each
fevered
curse
redounding
made
my
agony
the
worse
for
fits
of
anger
seldom
mollify
when
vacancy
reiterates
the
cry
or
walls
of
cold
unsympathetic
stone
respond
but
hollow
echoes
of
a
groan
though
limbs
as
free
and
restless
as
the
wind
are
not
to
shackles
readily
resigned
complaint
with
oath
and
bitterness
replete
in
prisoner
is
doubly
indiscreet
the
imprecation
born
of
righteous
wrath
subtracts
no
obstacle
from
any
path
bereft
of
star
or
luminary
bright
no
night
so
dark

in

radiations
soft
and

darkness
most
dense

and

no

voice
might
penetrate
the
gloom
nor
break
the
silence
of
that
fetid
tomb
with
genial
converse
which
in
some
degree
makes
men
forget
their
depth
of
misery
silence
most
tragic
horrible
profound
except
the
sharp
and
intermittent
sound
of

noise
of

things
the
squeak
of
vampires
and
their
whirr
of
wings
or
cries
of
swift
pursuit
or
of
despair
rang
out
upon
the
pestilential

as

prevailing

for

man
in
his
dominion
absolute
removed
above

province
of
the

from

has
little
to
distinguish
from
the

with
all

denied
and
his
gregarious

unsupplied

well
up
in

one

all
to
solitary

in
prison
thrall
through
the
long
hours
of
physical
distress
in
my
extremity
of
loneliness
i
felt
companionship
in
this

for
the
vicious
rat
and
sluggish
toad
thrice
sixty
days
of
corporal
decay

anguish
slowly
wore
away
thrice
sixty
nights
of
filthy
durance
passed
each
day
and
night
more
hopeless
than
the
last
my
limbs
no

brawny
and
alert
were
loathsome
and
inert
with
shaggy
beard
and
matted
unkempt
hair
with
face
no

rubicund
and
fair
which
haggard
and
emaciated
shone
and
through
the
sallow
skin
disclosed
the

thus
languished
nature
in
enforced
decay
till

burned

famished

what
followed
would
be
tedious
to
recite
the

but
the
incidents
of
flight
alone
an
outcast
from
my
native
hearth
an
aimless
wanderer
upon
the
earth
blown
as
the
desert
shifts
a
grain
of
sand
borne
by
each
wanton
gale
from
land
to

a
keen
observer
of
the

withal
a

strife
watching

as
a

of

where
love
hate

hold
us
by

in
various
forms
of

some

undone
by

positions
gained
at
a
tremendous

by
one
false

may
be
forever
lost
each
studied
movement
each
strategic
course
is
shaped
by
contact
with
opposing

moves
which
seem
fortuitous
and
blind
are
often
those
most
cunningly
designed
in
devious
ways
we
may
not

our

my

no

mine
my

seeking
an

shrine
have
found
a
home
within
the
mountain
west
where
truth
may
preach
her
gospel
unsuppressed
all
eyes
were
now
on
russian
pete
who
quietly
resumed
his
seat
at
the
conclusion
of
his
tale
the
wind
had
risen
to
a
gale
and
mourned
as
though
in
sympathy
with
human
woe
and
misery
or
as
the
winds
for
some
offence
to
man
or
his
creations
done
now
wailed
a
frenzied
penitence
in
orison
the
elements
petitioning
the
pardon
of
their
stormy
king
as
the
supplicating
cries
might
from
the
damned
in
torment
rise
and
cleave
the
palpitating
air
with
hopeless
accents
of
despair
as
uncle
jim
stirred
up
the
fire
with
observation
taciturn
all
watched
the
crackling
hemlock
burn
till
some
one
called
for
dad
mcguire
iv
a
sequel
of
the
lost
cause
now
dad
mcguire
was
old
and
bent
of
form
tanned
by
exposure
to
the
sun
and
storm
of
grizzled
beard
and
brow
the
furrows
traced
by
time
remorseless
plough
hardy
and
gnarl√®d
as
the
mountain
oak
bent
by
the
hand
of
time
but
still
unbroke
bowed
by
the
weight
of
years
and
labors
done
a
man
whose
course
had
neared
the
setting
sun
his
face
a
blending
of
the
calm
and
sad
so
they
called
him
dad
this
man
so
near
his
journey
close
with
great
deliberation
rose
coughed
once
or
twice
and
scratched
his
nose
then
as
became
a
veteran
surveyed
his
hearers
and
began
since
uncle
jim
and
russian
pete
declared
the
reasons
why
their
feet
this
rugged
wilderness
have
trod
and
left
for
aye
their
native
sod
i
too
will
recapitulate
that
chapter
from
my
book
of
fate
where
rappahannock
silver
stream
reflects
the
moon
resplendent
beam
and
sheds
a
mellow
lustre
the
trees
and
shrubs
that
fringe
the
shore
where
nature
lavish
hand
bestows
the
crystal
dews
and
generous
showers
where
lily
hollyhock
and
rose
and
herbs
and
flowers
combining
form
a
floral
scene
on
background
of
eternal
green
where
through
the
solemn
night
is
heard
the
warbling
plaint
of
feathered
throats
as
whippoorwill
and
mockingbird
pour
forth
their
wealth
of
liquid
notes
blank
page
while
the
accompanying
breeze
sighs
through
the
underbrush
and
trees
and
rippling
waters
blend
their
tune
in
salutation
to
the
moon
where
singing
insects
bugs
and
bees
mingle
their
droning
harmonies
with
croakings
of
loquacious
frogs
in
the
adjacent
swamps
and
bogs
where
from
the
water
air
and
ground
rises
a
symphony
of
sound
mid
nature
fond
environment
my
boyhood
happy
hours
were
spent
but
now
my
narrative
begins
i
had
a
brother
we
were
twins
sunburnt
and
freckled
light
of
heart
resembling
each
other
so
that
few
could
tell
the
two
apart
we
grew
as
two
twin
pines
might
grow
upon
the
isolated
edge
of
some
lone
precipice
or
ledge
that
overlooks
the
vale
below
remote
from
every
wooded
strip
with
but
each
other
fellowship
in
solitary
station
placed
with
branches
locked
and
interlaced
as
sworn
to
cherish
and
defend
each
other
to
the
bitter
end
illustration
with
swift
and
spoliating
flow
uprooting
many
a
noble
tree
to
strew
the
desert
waste
below
with
scattered
and
debris
page
the
course
of
uneventful
life
ran
smoothly
on
unmarred
by
strife
till
childish
fancy
disappeared
as
manhood
sterner
age
was
neared
then
in
a
city
bustling
mart
the
cords
of
fate
drew
us
apart
through
paths
of
accident
and
chance
environment
and
circumstance
within
their
complicated
maze
we
reached
that
parting
of
the
ways
where
sentiment
is
nipped
by
frost
where
ties
of
consanguinity
disrupt
and
often
disagree
or
through
indifference
are
lost
we
happened
that
eventful
spring
to
hold
a
family
gathering
to
reunite
each
severed
tie
so
soon
to
be
dissolved
for
aye
as
famines
with
their
blight
respond
when
some
vile
genius
waves
his
wand
and
leave
a
ghastly
aftermath
of
bleaching
bones
to
mark
their
path
or
demon
hands
in
foul
offence
pour
out
the
vials
of
pestilence
to
reap
with
desolating
breath
a
harvest
of
untimely
death
the
throes
of
internecine
war
now
rent
the
nation
to
its
core
and
smote
with
decimating
hand
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
land
estranging
never
to
amend
father
from
son
and
friend
from
friend
dissolving
many
sacred
cords
of
love
in
bitterest
enmity
lips
once
replete
with
friendly
words
now
challenged
as
an
enemy
we
who
had
never
quarrelled
before
parted
in
wrath
and
met
no
more
his
firm
convictions
led
him
where
a
banner
floated
in
the
air
in
silken
corrugations
curled
the
admiration
of
a
world
beneath
its
constellated
stars
its
azure
field
and
crimson
bars
although
no
message
ever
came
to
tell
his
fate
or
spread
his
fame
i
know
that
the
shot
and
shell
he
served
the
cause
he
fought
for
well
for
aught
i
know
his
manly
form
went
down
before
some
leaden
storm
and
lay
with
mangled
flesh
and
bone
among
the
numberless
unknown
who
filled
the
trenches
where
they
died
uncoffined
unidentified
the
voice
of
duty
led
me
where
the
strains
of
dixie
filled
the
air
where
curling
smoke
in
graceful
rings
rose
on
the
evening
silent
wings
and
hovering
the
mist
and
damp
betrayed
the
presence
of
the
camp
i
pass
the
story
of
the
war
the
cause
we
lost
but
struggled
for
through
four
long
years
in
southern
fens
to
wiser
tongues
and
abler
pens
through
four
long
years
of
tragedy
i
fought
bled
marched
and
starved
with
lee
till
appomattox
final
day
i
in
a
uniform
of
gray
before
the
cannon
yawning
mouth
defended
my
beloved
south
the
struggle
ending
in
complete
although
most
honorable
defeat
footsore
and
hungry
broken
sad
in
ragged
regimentals
clad
towards
rappahannock
silver
flood
i
plodded
homeward
through
the
mud
to
find
a
desolated
home
the
final
page
in
war
red
tome
that
day
as
i
remember
well
the
splashing
rain
in
torrents
fell
the
pregnant
clouds
discharged
their
debt
of
moist
apologetic
tears
as
if
in
passionate
regret
for
rain
withheld
in
famine
years
and
from
exuberance
of
grief
in
drizzling
penance
found
relief
or
as
if
tears
from
unseen
eyes
were
wafted
downward
from
the
skies
in
tardy
expiation
for
the
carnage
of
remorseless
war
the
sorrow
of
the
elements
for
human
woe
and
violence
the
roads
which
thread
the
country
lanes
had
turned
to
sheets
of
liquid
mud
as
if
to
cover
up
the
stains
of
civil
war
and
human
blood
that
evening
as
a
pall
of
cloud
enveloped
nature
as
a
shroud
bedraggled
and
dispirited
my
footsteps
to
the
old
home
led
again
i
stood
before
the
door
i
left
in
wrath
four
years
before
but
what
a
change
the
vandal
torch
had
long
devoured
the
roof
and
porch
the
gray
disintegrating
walls
still
swayed
and
tottered
in
the
air
or
lay
in
heaps
within
its
halls
in
melancholy
ruin
there
the
towering
chimney
black
and
tall
stood
as
if
mourning
its
fall
and
through
the
dismal
mist
and
rain
the
windows
void
of
sash
and
pane
seemed
staring
at
the
gathering
night
in
wild
expression
of
affright
the
fields
my
infancy
had
known
with
briar
and
weed
were
overgrown
the
sunlight
heralding
the
morn
no
longer
smiled
on
waving
corn
i
wandered
aimlessly
around
yet
heard
not
one
familiar
sound
no
stamp
of
hoof
nor
flap
of
wing
no
low
of
cow
nor
bleat
of
sheep
nor
any
tame
domestic
thing
silence
most
horrible
and
deep
no
pony
whinnied
in
its
stall
nor
neighed
in
answer
to
my
call
no
purr
of
cat
nor
bark
of
dog
naught
but
the
croaking
of
the
frog
no
voice
of
relative
or
kin
no
father
paused
and
stroked
his
chin
then
rushed
with
recognizing
grasp
to
hold
his
son
within
his
clasp
no
mother
with
her
silvered
hair
rocked
in
the
same
old
rocking
chair
first
at
the
ruins
then
the
ground
i
gazed
in
turn
mechanically
till
startled
by
a
mournful
sound
a
piteous
and
plaintive
cry
i
turned
and
peering
through
the
storm
discerned
the
outlines
of
a
form
bewailing
the
ruins
there
in
accents
of
complete
despair
i
knew
her
voice
and
felt
her
woe
she
was
my
nurse
poor
aunty
chloe
between
her
sobs
disconsolate
this
freed
but
ever
faithful
slave
told
of
my
ag√®d
parents
fate
then
led
me
to
the
double
grave
i
who
through
four
long
tragic
years
had
never
yielded
once
to
tears
clasping
her
hand
so
kind
and
true
wept
with
the
rain
and
she
wept
too
ere
daybreak
with
increasing
light
evolved
from
disappearing
night
the
morn
in
radiant
splendor
dressed
i
too
had
started
for
the
west
ere
the
conclusion
of
the
narrative
through
every
crack
and
cranny
of
the
door
the
snow
had
sifted
in
as
through
a
sieve
and
piled
in
little
cones
upon
the
floor
without
the
raging
tempest
still
assailed
within
the
fire
to
glowing
coals
had
failed
all
smoked
and
with
their
eyes
on
dad
mcguire
waited
for
some
one
else
to
build
the
fire
such
close
attention
had
his
tale
received
it
seemed
as
if
was
partially
believed
few
of
the
tales
which
we
enjoy
the
most
in
verity
may
that
distinction
boast
the
dying
embers
shed
their
mellow
glow
upon
the
ag√®d
face
of
dad
mcguire
as
he
swept
out
the
little
piles
of
snow
and
laid
a
hemlock
log
upon
the
fire
then
followed
disconnected
colloquies
and
witticisms
in
the
form
of
jest
the
joke
is
always
where
the
miner
is
the
form
of
levity
he
loves
the
best
for
cutting
truths
have
thereby
been
conveyed
where
delicacy
all
other
forms
forbade
as
some
fierce
gale
that
bows
the
gnarl√®d
oak
sinks
till
it
scarcely
sways
the
underbrush
the
laughter
incident
to
jest
and
joke
subsided
to
a
calm
and
tranquil
hush
all
husbanded
their
energy
and
strength
and
smoked
in
silence
for
a
moment
length
the
avalanche
just
then
a
crashing
sound
was
heard
that
caused
each
ruddy
cheek
to
blanch
though
no
one
moved
nor
spoke
a
word
all
listening
to
the
avalanche
with
apprehensive
ears
intent
knew
what
a
mountain
snowslide
meant
nor
marvel
that
each
visage
paled
nor
that
the
hardy
sinews
quailed
these
terrors
of
the
solitude
the
mountain
timbered
slopes
denude
sweeping
the
frozen
spruce
and
fir
as
with
a
snowy
scimitar
nor
can
the
stately
pines
prevent
its
irresistible
descent
a
foe
admitting
no
defence
a
moment
passed
in
dire
suspense
and
at
its
expiration
brief
each
heaved
a
breath
of
deep
relief
the
snowslide
terrible
and
vast
had
precipice
and
chasm
leapt
and
down
the
rugged
mountains
swept
missing
the
cabin
as
it
passed
the
cabin
clock
had
indicated
five
when
due
composure
was
at
length
restored
as
evidence
that
all
were
still
alive
queries
were
made
about
the
festive
board
as
sailors
shipwrecked
on
some
barren
rock
after
the
first
excitement
of
the
shock
mingle
their
words
of
gratitude
and
prayer
with
speculations
on
the
bill
of
fare
no
depth
of
danger
man
is
called
to
face
no
exultation
nor
extreme
disgrace
no
victory
nor
depression
of

can
shake
recurrent
hunger
from
her
seat
the

oracle
so
often
used
a
pack
of
playing
cards
was
soon
produced
a
turn
at
whist
the
afternoon
before
told
who
should
cut
the
wood
and
sweep
the
floor
as
one
of
the
disasters
of
defeat
washing
the

fell
to
russian
pete
a
game
of
played
with
equal
zeal
decided
who
should
cook
the
evening
meal
conspiring
cards
electing
uncle
jim
the
culinary
task
devolved
on
him
accordingly
with
acquiescent
nod
abiding
by
the
fortunes
of
the
game
this
patriarch
so
venerable
and
odd
whose
skill
in
cooking
was
of
local
fame
knocked
out
the
ashes
from
his
meerschaum
pipe
and
laid
it
tenderly
upon
the
shelf
took
a
preliminary
wash
and
wipe
and
squinting
in
the
mirror
at
himself
like
most
of
those
possessed
of
little
hair
brushed
what
he
still
had
left
with
greatest
care
small
use
for
comb
or
brush
had
uncle
jim
his
capillary
wealth
a
grayish
rim
or
hirsute
chaplet
as
it
had
been
called
by
other
miners
less
completely
bald
fringing
his
head
an
inch
above
the
ears
marked
off
his
shining
pate
in
hemispheres
his
flowing
beard
of
venerable
air
enjoyed
a
strict
monopoly
in
hair
as
if
the
raven
curls
that
once
adorned
his
occiput
that
habitation
scorned
and
took
as
an
expression
of
chagrin
a
change
of
venue
to
his
ample
chin
when
uncle
jim
was
duly
washed
and
groomed
the
running
conversation
was
resumed
and
as
the
veteran
his
task
pursued
mixing
the
biscuit
dough
with
judgment
good
all
smoked
and
talked
excepting
dad
mcguire
who
helping
uncle
jim
stirred
up
the
fire
raking
the
embers
in
a
little
pile
then
warmed
the
old
dutch
oven
up
a
while
and
after
greasing
with
a
bacon
rind
the
biscuit
dough
was
to
its
depths
consigned
soon
from
within
the
oven
partly
hid
by
embers
piled
upon
the
cumbrous
lid
the
baking
powder
biscuits
nestling
there
with
wholesome
exhalations
charged
the
air
a
pot
of
beans
suspended
by
a
wire
swung
like
a
pendulum
above
the
fire
and
answered
every
flame
combustive
kiss
with
roundelay
of
bubble
and
of
hiss
while
in
the
esculent
commotion
swam
the
residue
of
what
was
once
a
ham
though
epicures
who
yearn
for
fowl
and
fish
may
scorn
this
plain
and
inexpensive
dish
so
free
from
the
extravagance
of
waste
yet
succulent
and
pleasant
to
the
taste
of
all
the
varied
products
of
the
soil
the
bean
is
most
esteemed
by
those
who
toil
removed
in
place
less
prominent
and
hot
one
might
have
seen
the
old
black
coffee
pot
and
watched
the
puffs
of
aromatic
steam
rise
on
the
background
of
the
firelight
gleam
a
pleasant
sibilation
filled
the
room
as
with
an
unctuous
savor
or
perfume
the
bacon
sizzled
in
the
the
bane
and
terror
of
dyspeptic
man
but
those
who
labor
for
their
daily
bread
of
sedentary
ills
have
little
dread
the
simple
yet
salubrious
repast
was
on
the
rustic
table
spread
at
last
no
flashed
and
sparkled
in
the
light
nor

in
a
wilderness
of

the

stood
upon
a
shelf
where
every
one
could
reach
and
help
himself
the
nibbling
rodent
and
destructive
moth
found
naught
to
lure
them
in

with
all
the

the
final
course
was
ushered
in
at
last
when
apple
sauce
around
the
board
was
passed
as
uncle

stretched
forth
his
hand
across
the
table
to
the
dish
of
and
on
his
ample
pie
tin
placed
some
more
a
hurried
knock
resounded
from
the

and
steve
mccoy
a
miner
in
the
camp
with
brow
from
snow
and
perspiration
damp
rushed
in
from
out
the
white
and
whirling
waste
in
the
excitement
incident
to
haste
and
waiving
further
ceremony
cried
our
cabin
has
been
taken
by
a
slide
steve
as
a
snowy
santa
claus
appeared
pulling
the
icicles
from
off
his
beard
relating
in
his
intervals
of
breath
his
tale
of
dire
disaster
and
of
death
he
and
his
partner
smithy
were
on
shift
within
the
tunnel
working
in
a
drift
chasing
a
stringer
in
their
search
for
ore
within
the
hill
a
thousand
feet
or
more
the
rock
was
hard
and
both
of
them
were
tired
the
holes
were
blasted
as
the
work
required
then
to
their
consternation
and
surprise
upon
emerging
from
the
tunnel
mouth
no
hospitable
cabin
met
their
eyes
upon
the
hillside
sloping
toward
the
south
the
hut
of
logs
where
they
had
cooked
and
slept
had
been
from
human
eyes
forever
swept
their
partners
it
were
reason
to

were
suffocating
in
a
snowy
tomb
smithy
had
gone
to
uncle
bobby
green
whose
cabin
lay
the
nearest
to
the
scene
to
summon
help
and
get
the
boys
to
go
to
probe
with
poles
and
shovels
in
the

to
find
the
living

if

had
sped
to
make

two

who
arrived
the
night
before

been
invited
till
the
storm
was
to

their
hospitality
their
fate
had
raised
the
list
of
dead
perhaps
to
eight
ere

had
panted
forth
his

the

had
risen
up
with
one

the

at

the

slight
must
not
be

steve
as
a
runner
who
has
reached
his

leaned
half
exhausted
on
his
snowshoe
pole
the
while
his
sturdy
auditors
began
to
don
their
caps
and
mittens
to
a
man
then
wrapping
mufflers
their

put
on

forth
to
the
rescue
went
the
miners
bold
regardless
of
the
tempest
wild
and
brisk
regardless
of
the
driving
snow
and
cold
regardless
of
the
hazard
and
the
risk
facing
with
stalwart
resolution
brave
the
snowy
fate
of
those

of
the
storm
require
another
and

down
his

do
their
duty
in
the

through
gloomy

dark
which
skirt
the
confines
of
the
mountain

with
arduous
climb
and
hazardous
ascent
up
through
the
gulch
precipitous
and
wild
to
where
the

had
spent

on
such
occasions
little
may
be
said
the
sternest
use
subdued
and
whispered
breath
for
silence
seems
contagious
from
the
dead

vague
unconscious
reverence
for
death
facing
the
inconvenience
of
the
blast
which
whirled
the
drifting
snowflakes
as
it
passed
the
party
shovelled
and
with
one
accord
abstained
from
converse
no
one
spoke
a
word
till
hours
of
strenuous
search
disclosed
to
sight
six
corpses
from
their
sepulchre
of
white
the
other
two
who
by
some
wondrous
means
escaped
with
but
some
trifling
cuts
and
sprains
were
in
the
meantime
by
their
fellows
found
dazed
and
exhausted
in
the
gulch
below
for
men
will
grope
around
describing
circles
in
the
blinding
snow
until
they
sink
their
vital
forces
spent
and
crystal
snowflakes
weave
their
cerement
six
pairs
of
skies
each
improvised
a
sled
on
which
were
placed
the
stark
and
staring
dead
as
flickering
lanterns
flashed
a
ghostly
glow
upon
them
in
their
of
snow
the
sad
procession
now
retraced
its
course
back
through
the
dismal
forest
while
the
blast
wailed
forth
a
requiem
in
accents
hoarse
which
shuddering
pines
as
it
passed
with
sorely
overtaxed
and
waning
strength
as
some
spent
swimmer
struggling
to
the
shore
the
weary
party
found
its
way
at
length
back
through
the
forest
to
the
cabin
door
as
uncle
jim
whose
life
was
ever
spent
in
ministering
to
others
had
been
sent
ahead
the
dying
coals
had
been
renewed
with
fresh
supplies
of
pine
and
aspen
wood
and
blazed
a
cheery
invitation
forth
to
those
who
sought
the
comfort
of
the
hearth
norwegian
snowshoes
the
two
survivors
were
the
strangers
who
had
just
arrived
the
afternoon
before
their
names
nor
antecedents
no
one
knew
but
western
miners
do
not
close
the
door
on
weary
travellers
they
be
no
matter
what
their
race
or
pedigree
the
one
credential
needed
in
the
west
is
human
being
and
distressed
the
rescued
miners
much
benumbed
and
chilled
to
show
some

dad
mcguire
in
therapeutics
skilled
to
cure
the
maladies
of
beast
or
man
pursuant
of
his
task
from
out
some
secret
depths
produced
a
flask
which
to
the
rescued
miners
he
applied
as
guaranteed
to
warm
them
up
inside
by
way
of
chance
digression
should
you
ask
the
nature
of
the
liquid
in
the
flask
which
evidently
the
boys
had
used
before
we
must
admit
the
empty
bottle

most
of

camps

rescued
men
appeared
in
age
to
crowd
the
years
and
ten
of
stalwart
form
with
whitened
hair
and
beard
the
peer
of
multitudes
of
younger
men
in
matters
appertaining
to
physique
he
first
recovered
and
essayed
to
speak
as
dad
mcguire
and
kind
old
uncle
jim
were
ministering
as
best
they
could
to
him
in
kindly
interest
they
inquired
his
name
john
mcguire
the
labored
answer
came
as
dad
mcguire
leaned
over
him
to
hear
his
gaze
descried
a
mole
behind
his
ear
then
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
as
one
who
scarcely
can
believe
his
eyes
he
turned
the
stranger
over
on
his
back
found
two
more
moles
and
cried
my
brother
jack
erratic
as
the
vacillating
wind
are
the
mysterious
wanderings
of
the
mind
when
reason
lays
her
golden
veil
aside
what
vagaries
and
aberrations
glide
through
the
disordered
precincts
of
the
brain
what
phantoms
rise
and
disappear
again
what
curious
blendings
of
reality
and
fact
with
wildest
flights
of
phantasy
the
flickerings
of
reason
feeble
light
and
relaxation
into
mental
night
seem
as
a
beacon
on
some
coast
which
flutters
wanes
and
disappears
almost
then
with
a
flash
illuminates
the
shore
gleams
for
a
moment
and
is
seen
no
more
or
on
some
starless
midnight
when
the
storm
dissolves
in
chaos
each
familiar
form
and
robes
the
landscape
in
cimmerian
pall
the
lightnings
play
then
darkness
covers
all
unlocked
by
fever
and
delirium
the
cautious
tongue
becomes
no
longer
dumb
and
with
the
nervous
tension
overwrought
oft
gives
expression
to
the
secret
thought
was
thus
the
junior
of
the
rescued
men
a
modern
hercules
both
fair
and
young
with
accent
truly
cosmopolitan
raved
both
in
english
and
some
unknown
tongue
his
accents
wild
and
unintelligible
devoid
of
meaning
on
his
hearers
fell
with
the
exception
of
the
practised
ear
of
russian
pete
who
stood
beside
him
there
and
seemed
from
his
expression
to
detect
some
most
familiar
tongue
or
dialect
when
reason
with
a
penetrating
gleam
burst
through
the
canopy
of
mental
gloom
as
one
awakening
from
a
hideous
dream
he
started
up
and
stared
about
the
room
until
he
chanced
to
catch
the
kindly
eyes
of
russian
pete
which
kindled
with
surprise
a
look
of
mutual
recognition
passed
between
the
men
so
strangely
joined
at
last
all
that
the
congregated
miners
heard
was
one
presumably
a
russian
word
and
russian
pete
with
face
held
his
lost
brother
in
his
kind
embrace
dazed
by
exhaustion
comatose
and
deep
the
two
survivors
while
the
tempest
roared
were
through
the
gentle
ministry
of
sleep
to
normal
strength
unconsciously
restored
illustration
we
grew
as
two
twin
pines
might
grow
upon
the
isolated
edge
of
some
lone
precipice
or
ledge
page
is
human
nature
to
review
again
the
stirring
incidents
of
joy
or
pain
so
on
the
eve
of
the
succeeding
day
when
hours
had
passed
away
the
party
grouped
around
the
blazing
light
which
from
the
fireplace
streamed
into
the
night
and
in
its
glow
so
comfortable
and
warm
recounted
the
disasters
of
the
storm
like
some
informal
gathering
at
first
all
spoke
at
once
as
with
a
common
burst
then
as
the
intermittent
tempest
wailed
the
talk
subsided
and
a
calm
prevailed
all
watched
the
pitch
ooze
from
the
knots
and
burn
or
smoked
their
pipes
in
silent
unconcern
some
moments
passed
when
uncle
jim
arose
nudged
dad
mcguire
who
seemed
inclined
to
doze
and
as
he
started
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
addressed
him
and
the
russian
in
this
wise
two
days
ago
the
three
of
us
confessed
the
reasons
that
impelled
us
to
come
west
now
if
it
please
your
brethren
to
relate
the
strange
caprice
of
fortune
or
of
fate
which
led
them
hither
after
all
these
years
the
boys
will
listen
with
attentive
ears
vii
the
blight
of
war
all
eyes
now
sought
the
brother
of
mcguire
who
sat
apart
some
distance
from
the
fire
smoking
in
silence
while
the
flickering
light
mingled
its
crimson
with
his
locks
of
white
he
with
his
flowing
patriarchal
beard
a
sage
from
some
forgotten
age
appeared
or
wrinkled
seer
from
some
enchanted
clime
whose
eye
could
pierce
the
veil
of
future
time
there
in
the
ever
thickening
haze
of
smoke
he
being
three
times
importuned
awoke
as
from
his
corncob
pipe
and
nostrils
broke
the
spiral
wreaths
of
blue
tobacco
smoke
which
formed
a
smoky
halo
as
they
spread
a
foot
above
his
venerable
head
resembling
halos
which
the
artist
paints
angel
heads
or
medi√¶val
saints
this
man
of
years
so
calm
and
circumspect
stroked
his
long
beard
yawned
twice
and
stood
erect
like
to
a
wizard
or
magician
old
with
some
mysterious
secret
to
unfold
this
man
whose
bearing
would
command
respect
stepped
forth
and
eyed
his
listeners
direct
then
waiving
preludes
or
apologies
addressed
his
auditors
in
terms
like
these
these
lips
which
now
their
secret
shall
reveal
for
more
than
forty
years
have
worn
a
seal
for
years
as
hunter
pioneer
and
scout
i
roamed
the
western
solitudes
about
not
caring
whether
fortune
smiled
or
not
if
memory
painful
twinges
were
forgot
i
sought
as
many
other
men
have
done
within
the
wilderness
oblivion
work
is
the
only
sure
iconoclast
for
the
unpleasant
memories
of
the
past
so
as
a
placer
miner
prospector
and
half
a
dozen
avocations
more
within
the
city
and
the
solitude
the
goddess
of
success
i
wooed
twice
was
i
numbered
with
the
men
of
wealth
twice
lost
i
all
including
strength
and
health
for
wealth
when
fortune
fickle
wheel
revolves
adversely
into
empty
air
dissolves
till
fate
so
strangely
led
my
footsteps
here
mine
was
indeed
a
versatile
career
yet
none
my
antecedents
ever
guessed
nor
learned
from
me
the
cause
that
led
me
west
this
hair
and
beard
which
envy
not
the
drifting
snowbanks
their
unbroken
white
methinks
as
memory
scans
the
backward
track
vied
with
the
raven
glossy
coat
of
black
when
i
with
some
adventurous
emigrants
first
crossed
the
plain
monotonous
expanse
to
leave
my
former
history
behind
but
who
can
regulate
his
peace
of
mind
or
drop
the
morbid
burdens
of
the
breast
by
simply
going
east
or
coming
west
down
upon
the
rappahannock
shore
enshrined
in
memory
though
seen
no
more
there
lies
an
old
plantation
there
i
drew
my
infant
breath
and
into
manhood
grew
its
fields
are
overgrown
with
willows
now
for
more
than
forty
years
unturned
by
plough
while
war
red
desolation
razed
to
earth
the
old
stone
that
claimed
my
birth
ah
yes
is
forty
years
ago
or
more
since
standing
near
the
old
paternal
door
one
pleasant
morning
in
the
early
spring
with
some
few
friends
and
kinfolks
visiting
two
mounted
neighbors
stopped
in
passing
by
and
reining
up
their
horses
hurriedly
told
us
the
news
which
like
a
cannon
ball
sped
through
the
land
announcing
sumter
fall
the
animus
with
which
their
comments
fell
i
heard
months
later
in
the
rebel
yell
in
civil
war
or
fratricide
is
found
no
place
for
such
as
seek
a
middle
ground
though
lines
of
demarcation
intervene
no
peaceful
neutral
zone
may
lie
between
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
breast
the
tide
of
public
sentiment
and
to
decide
in
opposition
though
the
cause
be
right
when
crossing
public
sentiment
means
fight
is
easier
to
let
the
moving
throng
without
resistance
carry
you
along
when
he
who
hesitates
or
turns
around
may
in
the
grist
of
public
wrath
be
ground
but
men
there
are
you
can
not
drive
in
flocks
they
dash
like
breakers
or
resist
like
rocks
within
my
breast
i
fought
my
sternest
fight
i
could
not
view
the
southern
cause
as
right
and
yet
i
loved
the
people
of
the
south
debating
thus
i
opened
not
my
mouth
both
in
my
waking
hours
and
in
my
dreams
i
heard
the
arguments
of
two
extremes
my
conscience
said
uniform
of
blue
awaits
your
coming
wear
it
and
be
true
my
interests
argued
the
cause
be
wrong
your
people
have
espoused
it
right
along
your
worthy
family
has
for
many
years
seen
sorrow
only
in
the
white
man
tears
desertion
means
to
wear
the
traitor
brands
and
face
your
friends
with
muskets
in
their
hands
to
slay
them
with
the
bayonet
and
ball
or
by
perhaps
your
brother
hand
to
fall
i
heard
the
clarion
accents
of
the
fife
fan
into
flames
the
dormant
coals
of
strife
with
blast
prophetic
and
reverberant
swell
i
heard
the
bugle
echoing
voice
foretell
the
coming
conflict
while
the
brazen
notes
were
answered
by
the
cheers
from
many
throats
i
heard
the
measured
rattle
of
the
drum
proclaiming
that
the
day
of
wrath
had
come
i
heard
harangues
incendiary
and
loud
meet
with
the
approbation
of
the
crowd
i
saw
the
faltering
and
irresolute
greeted
with
jeer
and
deprecating
hoot
i
saw
the
threatening
clouds
of
war
increase
yet
prayed
for
peace
where
there
could
be
no
peace
the
winds
of
slavery
their
seed
had
sown
that
seed
to
rank
maturity
had
grown
the
cup
was
full
and
now
from
branch
and
root
the
whirlwind
came
to
strip
its
lawful
fruit
i
saw
my
friends
and
neighbors
march
away
with
martial
tread
in
uniforms
of
gray
i
saw
them
raise
their
caps
in
passing
by
and
fair
hands
wave
their
kerchiefs
in
reply
then
i
who
had
in
military
schools
received
some
insight
into
army
rules
and
being
of
a
martial
turn
of
mind
was
offered
a
commission
and
declined
my
declination
was
a
shock
to
all
said
they
shun
your
country
call
then
stay
at
home
from
wounds
and
scars
exempt
but
pay
the
price
your
former
friends
contempt
that
action
was
for
me
the
rubicon
which
crossed
i
had
no
choice
but
follow
on
but
what
a
change
the
penalty
was
high
my
childhood
friends
now
passed
me
coldly
by
i
who
had
been
a
social
favorite
received
no
salutation
when
we
met
fair
ones
who
used
to
smile
now
looked
askance
or
eyed
me
with
a
cold
indifference
my
action
seemed
base
cowardice
in
their
eyes
they
knowing
not
my
secret
sympathies
though
of
a
family
rich
and
widely
known
i
stood
in
the
community
alone
like
a
pariah
none
would
recognize
inaction
was
enough
to
ostracize
i
seemed
to
see
like
hagar
fated
son
against
me
raised
the
hand
of
every
one
the
time
had
come
when
i
must
make
my
choice
defend
one
side
with
musket
and
with
voice
then
i
to
conscience
and
convictions
true
seemed
an
apostate
for
i
chose
the
blue
there
are
inscriptions
on
the
scrolls
of
fate
which
seem
too
bitter
even
to
relate
i
waive
the
details
better
to
conceal
the
secret
skeletons
than
to
reveal
i
shall
not
tell
you
how
my
brother
stormed
when
he
of
my
intentions
was
informed
i
pass
the
story
how
my
ringing
ears
were
filled
with
threats
entreaties
and
with
sneers
and
how
with
face
the
maiden
came
who
was
to
be
my
bride
and
bear
my
name
how
she
appealed
to
sentiment
and
pride
plead
supplicated
then
forsook
my
side
and
how
one
evening
in
an
angry
burst
my
sire
pronounced
his
favorite
son
accurst
and
how
a
mother
clinging
to
her
child
saw
son
and
father
still
unreconciled
and
how
that
father
pointing
to
the
door
forbade
that
son
to
cross
the
threshold
more
go
said
he
never
more
return
go
slay
your
neighbors
pillage
sack
and
burn
but
never
while
the
golden
sun
doth
shine
be
welcomed
home
as
son
and
heir
of
mine
i
state
not
what
in
anger
i
replied
for
anger
in
my
breast
has
long
since
died
renounced
despised
and
disinherited
i
trod
the
path
of
duty
where
it
led
and
ten
days
later
in
the
rain
and
damp
stood
as
a
sentry
near
a
union
camp
fain
from
my
recollections
would
i
blot
these
images
which
time
erases
not
and
leave
to
history
undying
page
the
recitation
of
those
acts
of
rage
incarnadined
with
human
blood
appears
the
record
of
the
four
succeeding
years
black
with
the
ruins
of
the
vandal
flame
a
carnival
of
misery
and
shame
i
must
abridge
and
if
my
hearers
please
confine
myself
to
generalities
from
first
manassas
to
the
wilderness
a
period
of
some
four
years
more
or
less
but
anyway
till
long
in
a
musket
or
a
i
bore
though
years
have
passed
i
have
remembrance
yet
of
musketry
and
glistening
bayonet
as
retrospective
moods
attune
the
ear
to
memory
voice
again
i
seem
to
hear
the
cannon
deep
and
minatory
roar
like
breakers
dashing
on
a
shore
the
bursting
bomb
and
fulminating
shell
again
their
stories
of
destruction
tell
again
with
memory
eye
i
view
the
sanguinary
scenes
of
the
march
of
infantry
the
reckless
dash
of
cavalry
with
onslaught
fierce
and
rash
i
see
their
sabres
glittering
and
bare
flash
from
their
scabbards
in
the
smoky
air
i
hear
the
clatter
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
see
the
smoke
expand
in
greyish
puffs
as
rifles
flash
and
speed
the
deadly
ball
i
see
the
riders
from
their
horses
fall
yet
forward
moves
the
furious
attack
the
opposing
column
wavers
and
falls
back
i
see
the
impact
combat
hand
to
hand
horses
and
riders
writhing
on
the
sand
i
see
the
steeds
with
perspiration
wet
sink
on
the
bayonet
i
see
them
wounded
by
the
fatal
lunge
become
unmanageable
and
madly
plunge
foaming
and
snorting
with
the
sudden
pain
they
trample
on
the
wounded
and
the
slain
i
see
their
riders
in
the
stirrups
stand
and
grasp
their
pistols
with
the
bridle
hand
i
see
the
pistols
flash
and
sabres
thrust
a
scene
of
wild
confusion
smoke
and
dust
i
hear
the
bugle
sounding
a
retreat
they
now
retire
their
victory
complete
but
mark
the
price
paid
for
their
brief
success
horses
with
saddles
riderless
i
see
an
army
bivouac
on
the
field
to
nature
obdurate
demands
they
yield
and
on
the
ground
from
sheer
exhaustion
spent
they
lie
without
protecting
roof
or
tent
so
silently
their
prostrate
forms
are
spread
one
may
not
tell
the
sleeping
from
the
dead
i
see
before
the
campfire
fitful
gleam
the
sentry
pace
as
in
a
waking
dream
yet
manfully
subduing
the
fatigue
of
battle
and
the
march
of
many
a
league
for
no
excitement
or
emotion
serves
to
buoy
his
spirits
or
sustain
his
nerves
weak
from
the
loss
of
their
accustomed
rest
with
heavy
eyes
and
aching
bones
distressed
the
while
their
weary
comrades
soundly
sleep
the
sentinels
their
lonely
vigils
keep
as
from
the
glittering
expanse
of
skies
the
stars
look
down
with
cold
impassive
eyes
i
see
brigades
magnificent
and
large
with
bristling
bayonets
prepare
to
charge
i
see
their
banners
in
the
distance
gleam
reflecting
back
the
sun
resplendent
beam
within
the
shelter
of
the
rifle
pits
another
army
with
composure
sits
while
ever
and
anon
a
rifle
crack
seems
to
invite
the
spirited
attack
from
a
commanding
wooded
eminence
by
nature
calculated
for
defence
upon
the
advancing
regiments
i
see
the
murderous
belching
of
artillery
i
see
their
proud
and
militant
array
before
the
deadly
grapeshot
melt
away
before
the
rifle
supplementing
breath
whole
columns
sink
in
ghastly
heaps
of
death
i
see
them
close
their
gaps
and
press
ahead
but
only
to
augment
the
list
of
dead
i
see
them
stretched
upon
the
burning
sands
clutching
the
air
with
lacerated
hands
from
underneath
the
mutilated
heap
the
wounded
with
great
difficulty
creep
dragging
a
helpless
arm
or
shattered
limb
with
reeling
brain
and
sight
confused
and
dim
they
grope
they
crawl
or
limp
with
painful
tread
their
uniforms
no
longer
blue
but
red
and
pinioned
underneath
the
ghastly
pile
i
hear
them
struggle
for
release
the
while
but
fainter
ever
fainter
grow
their
cries
fainter
and
fainter
still
their
groans
arise
weaker
and
weaker
are
their
throes
until
with
one
last
quivering
throb
they
too
are
still
i
see
the
vultures
as
they
scent
afar
their
portion
in
the
reeking
spoils
of
war
far
in
the
distance
scattering
specks

this
is
the
realistic
side
of
war
which
most
men
overlook
and
all
abhor
which
differs
from
the
sentiments

war
is
a
crucible
that
tries
men
souls
a
drama
stern
in
all
its
various
r√¥les
though
saturated
with
all
forms
of
crime
is
celebrated
in
heroic
rhyme
though
opposite
to
every
humane
thought
with
murder
pillage
and
destruction
fraught
in
literature
in
history
and
art
it
forms
the
theme
or
plays
a

though
at
the
best
deplorable

with

the

its
eras
though
with
tragedy
replete
form
whereon
ambitious

perhaps
to

an

that
heroes
are

no

may
be
for
as
men
will
fight

will
fight
for

they
must
have
heroes
though

though
no

their

give
him
heroes
let
the
armies

and
he
will
worship
them
with

though
down
within
their
breasts
most
men
prefer
to
be
the
hero
than
the
worshipper

gain
the
plaudits
of
the

the

with
ambitious
zeal

upward
and
accomplishing
his

to
take
his

condescends
forgetting
that

honors
are
bedewed
with
human

and
based
on

blood
some
streaks
in
military
pomp
we
see
that
savor
much
of
pride
and
vanity
as
thirst
for
notoriety
and
fame
has
often
fanned
the
patriotic
flame
though
one
might
think
that
men
would
be
content
to
pluck
one
star
from
glory
firmament
yet
when
they
mount
the
ladder
a
few
rounds
their
envy
and
ambition
know
no
bounds
to
wear
the
epaulette
and
strut
with
pride
makes
men
forget
that
war
is
homicide
some

some

some
call

it
seems
that
some
have
been
created
for
the
honors
some
the
sacrifice
of
war
when
i
enlisted
as
a
raw
recruit
promotion
was
no
object
of
pursuit
but
liking
honor
more
than
sacrifice
on
i
soon
cast
envious
eyes
for

rash
act
was

bravery
good
fortune
made
a
corporal
of
me
soon
as
if
favored
by
some
lucky
charm
i
wore
a

stripes
upon
my

twice

i
wounded
twice
resumed
the

before
my
wounds
had
been
completely
healed

until
i

a

encysted
in
my

twice
was
i
captured
twice
as
prisoner
drank
i
the
dregs
from
out
the
cup
of
war
as
if
some
guardian
star
my
course
arranged
once
i
escaped
and
once
was
i
exchanged
then
as
lieutenant
rose
i
from
the
ranks
received
a
medal
and
a
vote
of
thanks
the
ladder
of
promotion
round
by
round
i
soon
ascended
and
henceforth
was
found
among
the
few
selected
favorites
whom
fortune
decks
with
stars
and
epaulettes
though
liking
not
the
r√¥le
of
matador
within
the
ruthless
theatre
of

from
private

i
played
until
my
sword
directed
a
brigade
i
wore
the
night
before
i
started
west
four
medal
decorations
on
my
breast
the
war
progressed
for
time
rolls
on
the
same
in
peace
or
war
and
became
a
chapter
in
the
annals
of
the
past
when
was
ushered
in
at
last
to
write
in
characters
of
blood
and
fire
its
page
of
human
immolation
dire
the
waiting
army
lay
encamped
before
the
rapidan
inhospitable
shore
the
first
few
weeks
devoid
of
incident
were
in
the
army
winter
quarters
spent
until
the
winter
on
his
snowy
wing
retired
before
the
genial
breath
of
spring
in
speculation
on
the
moves
to
come
the
tongue
of
prophecy
remained
not
dumb
but
showered
prognostications
of
defeat
succeeded
by
the
usual
retreat
when
rumors
of
offensive
action
planned
as
spring
approached
were
spread
through
each
command
until
the
troops
were
mobilized
and
massed
until
the
final
orders
had
been
passed
the
veterans
who
had
remembrance
still
recounted
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
but
soon
the
dreadful
wilderness
campaign
with
its
long
lists
of
wounded
and
of
slain
vied
with
the
carnage
of
the
year
before
if
it
be
possible
to
measure
gore
the
tactics
had
been
changed
for
no
retreat
was
ordered
as
the
sequel
of
defeat
instead
of
faltering
or
turning
back
there
came
another
furious
attack
another
movement
with
invasive
tread
and
spottsylvania
claimed
its
heaps
of
dead
defeated
but
uncrushed
and
undismayed
the
weakened
corps
including
my
brigade
with
sadly
thinned
and
decimated
ranks
was
hurled
once
more
against
the
rebel
flanks
there
in
a
hurricane
of
shot
and
shell
of
its
surviving
numbers
fell
was
thus
cold
harbor
quarry
made
complete
the
trio
of
victorious
defeat
three
southern
victories
yet
like
a
knell
upon
the
southern
ear
these
triumphs
fell
for
those
who
perished
in
that
dismal
waste
had
fallen
and
could
never
be
replaced
though
stubbornly
contested
inch
by
inch
the
lines
were
tightened
like
a
horse
cinch
we
watched
the
southern
forces
day
by
day
from
natural
abrasion
wear
away
one
evening
as
the
disappearing
light
unveiled
the
beauties
of
a
cloudless
night
with
much
diminished
numbers
my
brigade
its
camp
beside
the
rappahannock
made
some
five
miles
distant
from
the
spot
of
earth
associated
with
my
humble
birth
next
morning
ere
the
twinkling
stars
had
set
while
officers
and
men
were
sleeping
yet
a
courier
rode
up
to
my
command
and
placed
a
cipher
message
in
my
hand
then
spurring
well
his
horse
of
dapple
grey
with
parting
salutation
rode
away
this
was
the
import
of
that
message
stern
waste
the
district
all
the
fences
burn
leave
not
a
house
or
stable
unconsumed
my
father
house
among
the
rest
was
doomed
i
read
that
message
and
my
anger
blazed
my
home
to
be
by
my
own
orders
razed
a
vision
rose
before
my
swimming
brain
i
saw
the
old
parental
roof
again
i
saw
my
father
as
in
days
of
yore
smoking
his
pipe
beside
the
open
door
i
saw
his
gaze
with
penetrating
look
fixed
on
the
pages
of
some
wholesome
book
i
saw
my
mother
sit
beside
him
there
recumbent
in
her
old
reclining
chair
the
vision
changed
i
saw
her
parting
tears
my
father
parting
curse
rang
in
my
ears
go
said
he
nevermore
return
go
slay
your
neighbors
pillage
sack
and
burn
but
never
while
the
golden
sun
doth
shine
be
welcomed
home
as
son
and
heir
of
mine
i
felt
but
little
longing
to
return
and
less
desire
to
pillage
sack
and
burn
and
yet
those
cruel
orders
i
must
give
no
power
had
i
to
voice
the
negative
in
commonplace
affairs
of
life
is
true
men
may
elect
to
do
or
not
to
do
in
military
operations
they
have
no
alternative
but
to
obey
ah
fain
from
that
impending
holocaust
would
i
have
snatched
them
rather
had
i
lost
the
tinselled
honors
and
the
epaulettes
and
doffed
my
uniform
without
regrets
than
harm
by
word
or
deed
that
ag√®d
sire
yet
i
must
start
who
fain
would
quench
the
fire
i
read
and
read
that
cipher
message
there
how
many
times
i
have
not
to
declare
but
over
and
again
i
scanned
the
lines
and
pondered
well
its
symbols
and
its
signs
ironclad
were
they
from
every
standpoint
viewed
admitting
not
of
choice
or
latitude
so
to
the
officers
of
my
command
i
gave
their
orders
with
a
trembling
hand
and
swift
as
horseflesh
ever
travelled
went
to
seek
the
corps
commander
in
his
tent
to
crave
this
boon
or
favor
at
his
hand
my
father
house
be
still
allowed
to
stand
was
long
before
i
gained
an
audience
i
felt
but
can
not
picture
the
suspense
of
that
long
hour
involuntary
wait
too
late
my
heart
would
beat
too
late
too
late
i
took
a
seat
and
pulled
my
watch
out
once
late
too
late
the
timepiece
ticked
response
i
paced
the
ground
with
quick
impatient
tread
late
too
late
too
late
my
footsteps
said
late
too
late
too
late
with
fluttering
beat
my
heart
responded
to
my
echoing
feet
the
general
who
a
kindly
heart
possessed
no
sooner
heard
than
granted
my
request
was
but
a
moment
work
to
mount
my
steed
and
spur
him
to
his
maximum
of
speed
the
faithful
creature
seemed
to
understand
and
needed
little
urging
from
my
hand
as
down
the
turnpike
toward
my
childhood
home
he
fairly
flew
his
bridle
white
with
foam
his
hoofbeats
as
we
clattered
the
ground
returned
a
dull
premonitory
sound
which
seemed
to
echo
and
accentuate
the
burden
of
my
heart
late
too
late
the
fences
near
the
turnpike
as
we
passed
were
by
my
orders
disappearing
fast
the
rails
were
piled
in
heaps
and
soon
became
a
prey
to
war
red
ally
vandal
flame
houses
familiar
to
my
childish
sight
glowed
strangely
with
an
unaccustomed
light
while
from
adjacent
barns
and
broke
incipient
tongues
of
flame
and
clouds
of
smoke
the
orders
ruthless
and
inflexible
were
by
the
soldiers
executed
well
still
down
the
turnpike
dashed
my
sweating
horse
i
plied
the
cruel
spurs
with
double
force
when
in
the
distance
there
appeared
to
view
the
old
stone
my
childhood
knew
my
spirit
sank
though
i
was
not
surprised
my
worst
misgivings
had
been
realized
for
from
the
roof
and
upper
windows
came
dense
clouds
of
smoke
and
lurid
sheets
of
flame
it
had
its
portion
in
the
common
fate
late
the
mocking
rang
late
we
passed
a
company
on
their
return
from
executing
those
instructions
stern
it
was
the
company
of
my
brigade
wherein
i
first
was
a
lieutenant
made
its
officers
and
men
i
knew
by
name
they
cheered
me
when
their
captain
i
became
they
cheered
me
when
i
left
a
major
tent
to
be
the
colonel
of
their
regiment
they
did
my
bidding
how
could
i
condemn
they
honored
me
and
i
respected
them
and
yet
these
favorites
of
my
command
had
not
one
hour
before
applied
the
brand
which
was
transforming
with
its
wand
of
fire
my
father
house
into
his
funeral
pyre
that
they
had
met
resistance
i
could
see
for
wounded
men
in
number
two
or
three
were
by
their
comrades
carted
in
advance
while
one
more
limped
behind
the
ambulance
upon
a
stretcher
carried
in
their
van
the
soldiers
bore
the
body
of
a
man
he
was
their
captain
and
my
bosom
friend
he
plied
that
torch
and
met
a
bloody
end
i
plunged
the
spurs
but
not
without
remorse
into
his
steaming
flanks
and
urged
my
horse
which
i
disliked
to
tax
beyond
his
strength
such
speed
had
he
maintained
that
now
at
length
he
was
compelled
to
pant
and
hesitate
with
labored
effort
we
dashed
through
the
gate
or
where
the
gate
had
been
an
hour
before
for
gate
and
fence
alike
were
seen
no
more
save
in
the
scattered
bonfires
while
at
most
all
that
remained
was
here
and
there
a
post
there
was
a
fascination
in
that
sight
which
seemed
to
conquer
and
unnerve
me
quite
a
sense
of
horror
not
akin
to
fear
possessed
my
being
as
we
galloped
near
all
sorts
of
evil
pictures
filled
my
mind
as
one
who
seeks
yet
dreads
what
he
may
find
as
we
drew
nearer
i
remember
well
with
hissing
crash
the
roof
collapsed
and
fell
dismounting
i
the
premises
surveyed
and
viewed
the
havoc
and
destruction
made
crushed
by
the
disappointment
the
suspense
and
failure
of
my
planned
deliverance
i
moved
about
with
apprehensive
tread
to
seek
my
relatives
alive
or
dead
and
near
a
haystack
smouldering
ruins
found
my
father
body
weltering
on
the
ground
a
musket
tightly
clenched
within
his
hand
slain
by
the
troopers
of
my
own
command
his
whitened
locks
were
streaked
with
crimson
stains
the
same
red
blood
then
coursing
through
my
veins
close
by
his
side
a
form
with
silvered
hair
caressed
his
brow
with
dazed
abstracted
air
was
she
who
nursed
my
being
into
life
the
highest
type
of
mother
and
of
wife
our
glances
met
yet
i
framed
to
speak
she
started
up
then
with
a
piercing
shriek
fell
back
expiring
on
the
speechless
clay
of
him
whose
life
so
lately
ebbed
away
as
campfires
gleamed
and
heaven
orb
serene
with
borrowed
radiance
the
scene
within
a
grave
beneath
the
crimson
sands
i
laid
them
both
to
rest
with
my
own
hands
in
lieu
of
prayer
or
solemn
dirge
was
heard
the
twittering
cadence
of
the
mockingbird
uniting
with
the
sentry
muffled
tread
which
seemed
a
measured
requiem
for
the
dead
as
side
by
side
in
death
eternal
sleep
i
laid
them
tenderly
nor
paused
to
weep
for
feelings
which
in
tears
find
no
relief
had
dried
the
very
fountainheads
of
grief
i
shaped
a
double
mound
above
their
clay
planted
a
wooden
cross
and
went
my
way
that
night
i
tore
the
medals
from
my
breast
resigned
my
sword
and
started
for
the
west
viii
the
story
of
an
exile
such
was
the
tragic
story
told
and
tired
from
standing
on
his
feet
this
patriarch
so
gray
and
old
relit
his
pipe
and
took
a
seat
as
one
inert
and
overtaxed
from
strenuous
toil
he
soon
relaxed
into
that
dull
composure
which
fatigue
accords
to
poor
and
rich
the
observation
could
detect
no
levity
nor
disrespect
nor
through
his
story
was
there
heard
remark
or
interruptive
word
his
voice
and
bearing
as
he
spoke
admitting
not
of
jest
or
joke
the
common
feeling
seemed
to
be
respect
and
deepest
sympathy
as
childish
incidents
recurred
in
memory
to
dad
mcguire
as
one
who
neither
saw
nor
heard
he
sat
intent
upon
the
fire
yet
watched
the
blaze
with
that
intensity
of
gaze
which
shows
the
things
the
eyes
have
caught
are
not
the
subjects
of
the
thought
but
far
beyond
their
metes
and
bounds
the
vision
rests
on
other
grounds
this
story
of
a
life
rehearsed
left
other
eyes
bedimmed
and
blurred
each
with
his
silent
thoughts
conversed
and
none
presumed
to
speak
a
word
lest
sympathy
the
tears
provoke
old
uncle
jim
forgot
to
smoke
and
though
he
had
replenished
it
still
left
his
meerschaum
pipe
unlit
till
as
the
watchdog
suddenly
wakes
up
with
apprehensive
sniff
he
started
from
his
reverie
and
took
an
unsuccessful
whiff
but
embers
which
the
fire
supplied
soon
changed
the
fragrant
charge
inside
with
alternating
draw
and
whiff
into
a
meerschaum
teneriffe
all
smoked
excepting
dad
mcguire
who
stirred
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
placed
thereon
what
seemed
to
be
the
remnants
of
a
hemlock
tree
was
one
of
those
ungainly
stumps
composed
of
twisted
knots
and
bumps
which
every
boy
or
even
man
in
chopping
wood
skips
if
he
can
was
such
a
chunk
as
may
be
seen
after
the
woodpile
chopped
up
clean
the
log
they
split
the
blocks
upon
and
leave
when
all
the
rest
is
gone
this
chunk
which
none
of
them
could
split
though
many
had
attempted
it
by
divers
and
ingenious
ways
was
soon
enveloped
in
a
blaze
which
shed
its
glare
into
the
night
as
beacons
radiate
their
light
reclining
by
his
brother
side
abstracted
and
preoccupied
the
russian
rubicund
and
hale
was
importuned
to
tell
his
tale
and
slightly
coughing
from
the
smoke
forthwith
in
faultless
diction
spoke
my
brother
story
you
have
heard
the
same
should
mine
be
word
for
word
up
to
that
dismal
dungeon
grate
which
he
presumed
had
sealed
my
fate
i
doubt
not
he
related
well
the
horrors
of
that
loathsome
cell
so
that
description
now
by
me
would
fruitless
repetition
be
sufficient
be
it
to
declare
that
brief
was
my
detention
there
though
discontent
the
action
was
which
constituted
my
offence
i
felt
the
weight
of
russian
laws
when
chained
to
other
malcontents
before
the
chains
had
time
to
rust
i
plodded
through
the
mud
and
dust
as
many
exiles
erst
had
trod
their
footprints
often
stained
with
blood
with
clanking
chains
and
painful
stride
with
cossack
guards
on
either
side
we
marched
in
silence
in
the
reach
of
sabres
that
discouraged
speech
a
sad
procession
for
full
well
our
destinations
could
we
tell
down
country
lane
and
village
street
we
limped
with
bruised
and
blistered
feet
in
single
file
as
some
infirm
though
monstrous
centipede
or
worm
beset
by
some
tormenting
foe
might
move
with
locomotion
slow
and
tortured
by
its
enemy
propel
its
foul
dimensions
by
past
where
the
urals
bleak
and
high
invade
the
cerulean
sky
with
summits
desolate
and
gray
with
weary
tread
we
wound
our
way
where
intertwining
branches
made
a
vernal
canopy
of
shade
the
from
their
arches
high
mocked
at
our
chains
as
we
passed
by
the
only
forms
of
earth
or
air
deprived
of
rightful
freedom
there
at
night
in
forest
depths
profound
we
lay
upon
the
cheerless
ground
where
on
our
route
we
chanced
to
be
nor
couch
nor
coverlet
had
we
between
us
and
the
turf
or
stones
to
soothe
our
tired
and
aching
bones
our
limbs
emaciated
grew
ragged
were
we
and
dirty
too
as
the
plains
we
dragged
our
grievous
weight
of
chains
as
passed
the
autumn
months
away
six
leagues
we
measured
every
day
six
leagues
our
loads
were
daily
borne
on
shoulders
galled
and
each
morning
was
our
march
begun
before
the
advent
of
the
sun
while
every
evening
in
the
west
he
sank
before
we
paused
for
rest
time
and
again
upon
the
road
the
weaker
dropped
beneath
their
load
and
fainting
from
fatigue
and
pain
they
sank
but
rose
not
up
again
where
the
pacific
broad
expanse
of
sleeping
waters
calm
and
fair
divide
the
mighty
continents
with
their
pelagic
barrier
upon
the
asiatic
shore
some
twelve
leagues
from
the
sea
or
more
in
course
of
time
our
weary
line
was
halted
at
a
penal
mine
was
there
within
a
log
stockade
constructed
in
a
manner
crude
that
we
our
habitation
made
through
many
months
of
servitude
a
mine
a
mine
the
world
around
a
cheerless
place
wherever
found
dismal
and
dark
beyond
compare
and
charged
with
foul
unwholesome
air
which
fills
the
lungs
at
every
breath
with
germs
of
an
untimely
death
in
caverns
subterranean
with
limbs
not
bound
by
gyve
or
chain
of
those
who
toil
few
are
the
men
who
reach
the
threescore
years
and
ten
such
was
the
mine
wherein
we
slaved
from
morn
till
night
or
when
the
sun
had
ceased
to
shine
we
toiled
till
his
returning
light
then
dragged
each
one
his
ball
and
chain
back
to
his
bed
of
straw
again
day
after
day
could
there
be
seen
the
same
monotonous
routine
such
was
the
drudging
life
we
led
till
hope
from
every
bosom
fled
and
each
became
as
time
rolled
on
a
spiritless
automaton
the
details
of
a
captive
lot
i
fear
would
interest
you
not
so
your
forbearance
i
beseech
while
in
impromptu
forms
of
speech
i
strive
in
simple
terms
to
shape
the
narrative
of
my
escape
from
out
the
realms
of
tropic
heat
invading
with
contagious
feet
came
there
a
plague
one
up
from
the
south
with
fatal
stride
it
stalked
and
poured
its
vials
forth
upon
the
sparsely
settled
north
a
wave
of
pestilence
and
fear
swept
the
northland
far
and
near
the
frenzied
peasants
in
their
fright
sought
safety
in
promiscuous
flight
in
consternation
and
alarm
to
seek
immunity
from
harm
they
left
the
sick
in
their
distress
and
fled
into
the
wilderness
as
if
within
the
solitude
the
nemesis
which
had
pursued
might
satiate
its
deadly
wrath
and
deviate
or
change
its
path
and
its
malignant
steps
retrace
back
to
the
southern
the
left
behind
the
paralyzed
the
halt
and
blind
the
well
in
abject
terror
fled
forsook
the
dying
while
the
dead
unburied
in
the
summer
breeze
became
a
nidus
of
disease
wherefrom
fresh
seeds
of
pestilence
were
scattered
by
the
elements
of
those
who
felt
its
loathsome
breath
but
few
escaped
a
speedy
death
so
rapid
were
the
ravages
of
that
distemper
or
disease
that
many
stricken
in
the
night
expired
before
the
dawn
of
light
for
some
who
in
the
morning
time
stood
well
and
strong
in
manhood
prime
the
noontide
brought
the
fatal
scourge
and
evening
zephyrs
played
the
dirge
those
who
survived
the
plague
direct
oft
died
from
hunger
and
neglect
the
convalescents
woke
and
found
no
ministering
forms
around
no
watcher
sitting
by
the
bed
alone
were
they
save
for
the
dead
they
called
but
echo
voice
alone
answered
the
supplicating
moan
they
prayed
but
no
one
heard
their
prayer
then
perished
from
the
want
of
care
the
suffering
of
the
stricken
then
defies
descriptive
word
or
pen
i
see
with
memory
vision
yet
the
beads
of
suppurating
sweat
stand
on
the
burning
brows
of
those
smitten
with
agonizing
throes
as
racking
tortures
permeate
each
swollen
and
distorted
shape
with
thirst
which
none
may
mitigate
they
call
for
drink
with
mouths
agape
yet
naught
may
succor
such
distress
save
coma
and
unconsciousness
when
these
the
intellect
benumb
the
sense
and
feeling
overcome
within
its
tuneful
cavern
hung
no
longer
rests
the
fluent
tongue
but
swollen
by
the
pain
and
drouth
protrudes
from
out
the
parching
mouth
the
burning
and
discolored
lip
imagined
moisture
tries
to
sip
again
they
vainly
strive
to
speak
their
fevered
incoherencies
but
vocal
organs
parched
and
weak
respond
but
labored
gasp
and
wheeze
i
scent
the
putrefying
air
and
see
the
horror
and
despair
depicted
on
the
lineaments
of
every
stricken
countenance
i
see
them
writhe
then
suddenly
with
ghastly
leer
convulse
and
die
as
stagnant
waters
generate
a
fungous
and
unsightly
freight
of
morbid
scum
and
slimy
moss
of
origin
spontaneous
so
latent
germs
unnoticed
lurk
in
readiness
for
deadly
work
when
these
the
right
conditions
find
and
spread
infection
to
the
wind
chronologers
both
far
and
near
record
an
epidemic
year
within
the
bounds
of
our
stockade
the
plague
its
foul
appearance
made
and
soon
inoculated
there
its
virus
to
the
very
air
till
the
genial
summer
breeze
seemed
a
dispenser
of
disease
then
as
impartial
lightnings
strike
the
nobleman
and
serf
alike
within
this
filthy
prison
yard
it
smote
both
prisoner
and
guard
the
difference
of
race
of
lot
of
rank
was
speedily
forgot
as
discipline
succumbed
to
dread
and
officers
and
soldiers
fled
save
such
as
fallen
by
the
way
helpless
and
unattended
lay
till
death
brought
silence
and
relief
from
agony
intense
though
brief
within
the
walls
of
the
stockade
not
one
unstricken
person
stayed
except
some
convicts
who
remained
for
one
good
reason
we
were
chained
our
dingy
quarters
floor
and
bed
were
filled
with
dying
and
with
dead
the
only
shelter
we
could
claim
a
fetid
became
i
need
not
tell
you
how
the
air
was
filled
with
accents
of
despair
how
clamor
and
entreaty
smote
the
air
from
blistered
tongue
and
throat
as
burning
rash
and
ghastly
rheum
supplanted
nature
ruddy
bloom
how
moan
and
outcry
curse
and
prayer
were
mingled
with
each
other
there
some
raved
in
dialects
unknown
or
terms
provincial
while
the
groan
the
common
tongue
of
suffering
men
was
echoed
ever
and
again
some
with
reluctant
clutch
and
gasp
saw
life
receding
from
their
grasp
and
some
with
stoic
countenance
maintained
a
stern
indifference
for
what
are
death
abstruse
alarms
when
life
is
shorn
of
all
its
charms
as
zealots
when
they
come
to
die
lift
their
enraptured
gaze
on
high
and
clasp
to
the
expiring
breast
some
crucifix
or
icon
blest
and
mutter
with
stertorious
breath
some
sacred
word
or
shibboleth
then
sink
expectant
and
resigned
as
if
in
death
a
boon
to
find
some
in
excruciating
pain
welcomed
its
foul
destroying
breath
and
sought
from
cruel
gyve
and
chain
emancipation
though
in
death
is
not
my
purpose
to
declare
the
horrors
which
befell
us
there
as
passed
the
fatal
hours
away
of
that
most
memorable
day
each
hour
increased
our
dire
distress
yet
found
our
numbers
less
and
less
till
when
the
shadows
overspread
the
major
number
were
the
dead
but
three
survived
that
awful
night
to
gaze
upon
the
morning
light
and
when
the
noonday
breezes
blew
that
three
had
been
reduced
to
two
and
ere
the
setting
of
the
sun
i
was
the
sole
remaining
one
a
silence
strangely
mute
and
dumb
succeeded
pandemonium
there
when
my
last
companion
died
chained
to
a
corpse
on
either
side
strange
as
may
seem
the
miracle
i
never
felt
more
strong
and
well
nor
held
my
life
in
less
esteem
in
that
position
most
extreme
by
silent
death
surrounded
i
enjoyed
a
weird
immunity
serve
no
purpose
to
recite
my
feelings
as
approaching
night
with
his
impenetrable
pall
descended
and
enveloped
all
i
sat
alone
in
fear
and
dread
chained
to
the
floor
and
to
the
dead
a
gruesome
and
revolting
sight
is
horrifying
in
the
light
but
when
dissembling
night
conceals
the
breast
a
double
terror
feels
that
darkness
black
beyond
compare
seemed
a
fit
mantle
for
despair
few
are
the
words
when
hope
has
failed
an
awful
quietude
prevailed
i
sat
a
mute
and
helpless
lump
and
felt
my
heart
pulsating
thump
with
movement
regular
and
strong
propel
life
crimson
flood
along
but
made
no
sound
until
the
spell
of
silence
was
unbearable
i
spoke
but
all
the
ears
in
reach
were
deaf
to
every
charm
of
speech
i
shouted
till
the
roof
the
floor
and
walls
resounded
with
the
roar
i
called
the
dead
men
at
my
side
but
echo
voice
alone
replied
i
was
alone
nor
man
nor
brute
was
there
save
those
so
stark
and
mute
my
voice
upon
my
listening
ear
fell
most
unnatural
and
queer
as
if
with
weird
uncanny
sound
the
walls
responsive
voices
found
and
echoed
back
the
tones
at
will
to
mock
those
tongues
so
cold
and
still
though
these
vociferations
made
my
spirit
none
the
less
afraid
the
silence
seemed
more
terrible
words
fail
me
as
i
strive
to
tell
how
in
my
desperation
i
abandoned
hope
yet
could
not
die
i
never
craved
the
morning
light
as
through
that
terrifying
night
for
gentle
but
erratic
sleep
withheld
her
respite
soft
and
deep
as
in
that
charnel
house
i
lay
till
twilight
ushered
in
the
day
when
daylight
had
returned
again
i
strove
with
the
relentless
chain
twisted
and
tugged
until
at
length
a
more
than
ordinary
strength
possessed
my
arm
and
at
one
stroke
the
rivets
weakened
bent
and
broke
one
master
wrench
and
from
the
floor
the
ring
which
held
the
chain
i
tore
i
dragged
the
dead
men
the
ground
till
forge
and
anvil
i
had
found
there
with
the
hammer
rasp
and
file
i
wrought
with
diligence
the
while
at
some
expense
of
time
and
pains
i
disengaged
the
cruel
chains
and
stood
once
more
erect
and
free
thus
ended
my
captivity
a
guard
lay
prostrate
on
the
sand
his
rifle
in
his
lifeless
hand
i
wrenched
it
from
his
rigid
clutch
then
played
the
ghoul
in
for
clothing
and
accoutrements
escaped
not
my
despoiling
touch
i
breathed
the
air
of
liberty
alone
i
stood
but
armed
and
free
to
mislead
any
watchful
eyes
i
donned
a
militant
disguise
and
in
the
dead
man
uniform
was
soon
prepared
for
strife
or
storm
unseen
unhindered
unpursued
i
soon
was
in
the
solitude
contending
with
impediments
which
every
wilderness
presents
primeval
forests
through
which
poured
rivers
unknown
to
bridge
or
ford
swamps
overgrown
with
weeds
and
moss
almost
impossible
to
cross
a
waste
of
fallen
trees
and
logs
rank
vegetation
stagnant
bogs
decaying
leaves
profusely
spread
which
rustled
at
the
slightest
tread
while
underbrush
and
thicket
made
a
thorny
maze
or
barricade
through
which
was
difficult
to
force
a
passage
or
retain
one
course
there
my
experience
began
along
the
lines
of
primal
man
my
fare
as
i
remember
well
was
strictly
aboriginal
for
stupid
grouse
and
ptarmigan
were
easily
approached
and
slain
and
as
a
relish
for
such
food
i
had
the
berries
of
the
wood
through
arches
of
umbrageous
shade
i
journeyed
onward
undismayed
and
undisturbed
by
man
or
beast
made
daily
progress
toward
the
east
till
viewing
the
pacific
shore
northward
along
the
coast
i
bore
i
kept
that
course
for
many
days
where
none
but
savage
eyes
might
gaze
full
many
a
mile
my
footsteps
led
through
regions
uninhabited
till
where
kamschatka
barren
rocks
resist
the
sea
aggressive
shocks
one
gloomy
afternoon
i
stood
and
watched
the
wide
and
trackless
flood
make
a
tedious
tale
i
fear
not
meet
for
recitation
here
should
i
endeavor
to
relate
the
details
of
a
hermit
fate
to
all
appearance
i
was
free
a
plethora
of
liberty
is
little
consolation
where
one
lonely
recluse
breathes
the
air
for
solitary
mortals
find
but
little
joy
and
peace
of
mind
when
freedom
is
enjoyed
alone
its
fondest
attributes
are
flown
men
of
companions
destitute
sink
to
the
level
of
the
brute
their
sacred
essence
seems
to
be
dependent
on
community
each
morning
in
the
reddening
skies
alone
i
watched
the
sun
god
rise
while
every
evening
in
the
west
alone
i
watched
him
sink
to
rest
to
catch
a
passing
ship
in
vain
i
hourly
scanned
the
watery
plain
till
one
fair
morn
a
distant
sail
brought
the
conclusion
of
my
tale
the
whaler
such
she
proved
to
be
steered
landward
through
a
rippling
sea
and
made
directly
for
the
shore
she
anchored
then
i
saw
them
lower
the
ship
at
a
command
i
saw
them
row
then
saw
them
land
fearing
occasion
might
require
the
service
of
a
signal
fire
a
mass
of
driftwood
i
had
heaped
behind
that
pile
i
hid
and
peeped
from
that
concealed
position
i
watching
with
closest
scrutiny
discovered
that
the
squad
of
ten
were
not
my
their
purpose
i
could
now
discern
one
had
a
spade
which
turn
by
turn
each
wielded
till
their
willing
hands
had
delved
a
grave
within
the
sands
six
of
the
party
i
espied
returning
to
the
side
where
from
its
bottom
they
began
to
raise
the
body
of
a
man
in
canvas
strips
securely
sewed
all
ready
for
its
last
abode
from
every
motion
it
would
seem
the
object
of
sincere
esteem
from
my
location
i
could
see
them
balance
it
most
tenderly
as
on
six
shoulders
broad
and
strong
they
bore
it
sorrowfully
along
while
wind
and
surge
joined
in
a
requiem
or
dirge
the
sun
through
hazy
autumn
skies
shone
on
the
simple
obsequies
as
round
the
open
grave
they
stood
in
reverential
attitude
and
shovelled
in
the
brown
sea
sand
one
with
a
in
his
hand
essayed
the
r√¥le
of
corybant
omitting
the
accustomed
chant
he
read
a
burial
service
there
concluding
with
its
words
of
prayer
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
these
words
of
that
abiding
trust
in
life
beyond
the
fleeting
span
which
heaven
has
accorded
man
elysian
fields
where
perfect
peace
succeeds
life
transitory
lease
the
inextinguishable
fire
of
faith
the
daughter
of
desire
glows
brightest
when
the
faltering
breath
is
conscious
of
approaching
death
bent
the
weight
of
many
years
the
form
of
hoary
age
appears
as
the
failing
hourglass
shows
that
life
is
drawing
to
its
close
and
when
the
final
sands
are
spent
the
trembling
limbs
make
their
descent
into
the
shadows
while
the
ray
of
faith
illuminates
the
way
vain
introspection
which
descries
no
light
behind
the
mysteries
of
death
engenders
in
the
breast
but
vacant
yearnings
and
unrest
relying
on
the
eye
of
hope
we
look
beyond
our
mundane
scope
and
with
enraptured
vision
see
the
of
futurity
with
eager
eyes
i
watched
them
stand
upon
that
barren
waste
of
sand
until
the
final
words
of
prayer
had

were

ear
borne
on

which
blew
directly
from
the

my
breast
with
deep
emotion
stirred
i
recognized
their

an

read

proved

they
loved

there
rose
another

teach
beside
that
northern
sea
its
lesson
of
mortality
death
on
that
dismal
northern
main

binding
with
its
silent

freed
me

before
them
face
to
face
then
in
their
own
vernacular
gave
proper
salutation
there
was
plain
that
they
regarded
me
as
human
salvage
which
the
sea
had
in
some
evil
moment
tossed
upon
that
bleak
and
barren
coast
like
broken
wreckage
or
debris
cast
up
by
the
capricious
sea
with
frank
but
sympathetic
eyes

me
with
no

i
rehearsed
without

my
story

a
castaway
repairing
to

soon

had
never
a
thought
to
be
sad
but
meandered
in
joy
through
the
meadows
with
bluebell
and
columbine
clad
her
ripples
were
ripples
of
laughter
and
the
soft
dulcet
voice
of
her
flow
was
suggestive
of
peace
and
affection
not
accents
of
anguish
and
woe
long
ago
ere
the
foot
of
the
white
man
had
left
its
first
print
on
the
sod
a
people
both
free
and
contented
her

the

they

the

with
singing
which
blent
with
its
musical
flow
this
people
so
artless
and
peaceful
knew
nothing
of
carnage
and
war
but
dwelt
in
such
quiet
and
plenty
they
knew
not
what
weapons
were
for
they
gathered
the
maize
in
its
season
unmindful
of
famine
or
foe
and
chanted
their
thanks
to
the
spirits
that
dwelt
in
the
ca√±ons
below
but
one
evil
day
from
the
northland
swept
an
army
in
battle
array
which
fell
on
this
innocent
people
and
massacred
all
in
a
day
their
bodies
were
cast
in
the
river
a
feast
for
the
vultures
when

the
laughter
and
