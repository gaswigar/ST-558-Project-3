salvation
from
sin
the
remission
of
sins
jesus
in
the
world
jesus
and
his
fellow
townsmen
the
heirs
of
heaven
and
earth
sorrow
the
pledge
of
joy
god
family
the
reward
of
obedience
the
yoke
of
jesus
the
salt
and
the
light
of
the
world
the
right
hand
and
the
left
the
hope
of
the
universe
from
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
i
i
would
help
some
to
understand
what
jesus
came
from
the
home
of
our
father
to
be
to
us
and
do
for
us
everything
in
the
world
is
more
or
less
misunderstood
at
first
we
have
to
learn
what
it
is
and
come
at
length
to
see
that
it
must
be
so
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
then
we
know
it
and
we
never
know
a
thing
until
we
know
it
thus
i
presume
there
is
scarce
a
human
being
who
resolved
to
speak
openly
would
not
confess
to
having
something
that
plagued
him
something
from
which
he
would
gladly
be
free
something
rendering
it
impossible
for
him
at
the
moment
to
regard
life
as
an
altogether
good
thing
most
men
i
presume
imagine
that
free
of
such
and
such
things
antagonistic
life
would
be
an
unmingled
satisfaction
worthy
of
being
prolonged
indefinitely
the
causes
of
their
discomfort
are
of
all
kinds
and
the
degrees
of
it
reach
from
simple
uneasiness
to
a
misery
such
as
makes
annihilation
the
highest
hope
of
the
sufferer
who
can
persuade
himself
of
its
possibility
perhaps
the
greater
part
of
the
energy
of
this
world
life
goes
forth
in
the
endeavour
to
rid
itself
of
discomfort
some
to
escape
it
leave
their
natural
surroundings
behind
them
and
with
strong
and
continuous
effort
keep
rising
in
the
social
scale
to
discover
at
every
new
ascent
fresh
trouble
as
they
think
awaiting
them
whereas
in
truth
they
have
brought
the
trouble
with
them
others
making
haste
to
be
rich
are
slow
to
find
out
that
the
poverty
of
their
souls
none
the
less
that
their
purses
are
filling
will
yet
keep
them
unhappy
some
court
endless
change
nor
know
that
on
themselves
the
change
must
pass
that
will
set
them
free
others
expand
their
souls
with
knowledge
only
to
find
that
content
will
not
dwell
in
the
great
house
they
have
built
to
number
the
varieties
of
human
endeavour
to
escape
discomfort
would
be
to
enumerate
all
the
modes
of
such
life
as
does
not
know
how
to
live
all
seek
the
thing
whose
defect
appears
the
of
their
misery
and
is
but
the
variable
of
it
the
cause
of
the
shape
it
takes
not
of
the
misery
itself
for
when
one
apparent
cause
is
removed
another
at
once
succeeds
the
real
cause
of
his
trouble
is
a
something
the
man
has
not
perhaps
recognized
as
even
existent
in
any
case
he
is
not
yet
acquainted
with
its
true
nature
however
absurd
the
statement
may
appear
to
one
who
has
not
yet
discovered
the
fact
for
himself
the
cause
of
every
man
discomfort
is
evil
moral
evil
first
of
all
evil
in
himself
his
own
sin
his
own
wrongness
his
own
unrightness
and
then
evil
in
those
he
loves
with
this
latter
i
have
not
now
to
deal
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
it
is
for
the
man
to
get
rid
of
his
own
sin
no
special
sin
may
be
recognizable
as
having
caused
this
or
that
special
physical
discomfort
which
may
indeed
have
originated
with
some
ancestor
but
evil
in
ourselves
is
the
cause
of
its
continuance
the
source
of
its
necessity
and
the
preventive
of
that
patience
which
would
soon
take
from
it
or
at
least
blunt
its
sting
the
evil
is
unnecessary
and
passes
with
the
attainment
of
the
object
for
which
it
is
permitted
namely
the
development
of
pure
will
in
man
the
suffering
also
is
essentially
unnecessary
but
while
the
evil
lasts
the
suffering
whether
consequent
or
merely
concomitant
is
absolutely
necessary
foolish
is
the
man
and
there
are
many
such
men
who
would
rid
himself
or
his
fellows
of
discomfort
by
setting
the
world
right
by
waging
war
on
the
evils
around
him
while
he
neglects
that
integral
part
of
the
world
where
lies
his
business
his
first
business
namely
his
own
character
and
conduct
were
it
possible
an
absurd
supposition
that
the
world
should
thus
be
righted
from
the
outside
it
would
yet
be
impossible
for
the
man
who
had
contributed
to
the
work
remaining
what
he
was
ever
to
enjoy
the
perfection
of
the
result
himself
not
in
tune
with
the
organ
he
had
tuned
he
must
imagine
it
still
a
distracted
jarring
instrument
the
philanthropist
who
regards
the
wrong
as
in
the
race
forgetting
that
the
race
is
made
up
of
conscious
and
wrong
individuals
forgets
also
that
wrong
is
always
generated
in
and
done
by
an
individual
that
the
wrongness
exists
in
the
individual
and
by
him
is
passed
over
as
tendency
to
the
race
and
that
no
evil
can
be
cured
in
the
race
except
by
its
being
cured
in
its
individuals
tendency
is
not
absolute
evil
it
is
there
that
it
may
be
resisted
not
yielded
to
there
is
no
way
of
making
three
men
right
but
by
making
right
each
one
of
the
three
but
a
cure
in
one
man
who
repents
and
turns
is
a
beginning
of
the
cure
of
the
whole
human
race
even
if
a
man
suffering
be
a
far
inheritance
for
the
curing
of
which
by
faith
and
obedience
this
life
would
not
be
sufficiently
long
faith
and
obedience
will
yet
render
it
endurable
to
the
man
and
overflow
in
help
to
his
the
groaning
body
wrapt
in
the
garment
of
hope
will
with
outstretched
neck
look
for
its
redemption
and
endure
the
one
cure
for
any
organism
is
to
be
set
right
to
have
all
its
parts
brought
into
harmony
with
each
other
the
one
comfort
is
to
know
this
cure
in
process
rightness
alone
is
cure
the
return
of
the
organism
to
its
true
self
is
its
only
possible
ease
to
free
a
man
from
suffering
he
must
be
set
right
put
in
health
and
the
health
at
the
root
of
man
being
his
rightness
is
to
be
free
from
wrongness
that
is
from
sin
a
man
is
right
when
there
is
no
wrong
in
him
the
wrong
the
evil
is
in
him
he
must
be
set
free
from
it
i
do
not
mean
set
free
from
the
sins
he
has
done
that
will
follow
i
mean
the
sins
he
is
doing
or
is
capable
of
doing
the
sins
in
his
being
which
spoil
his
nature
the
wrongness
in
him
the
evil
he
consents
to
the
sin
he
is
which
makes
him
do
the
sin
he
does
to
save
a
man
from
his
sins
is
to
say
to
him
in
sense
perfect
and
eternal
up
and
walk
be
at
liberty
in
thy
essential
being
be
free
as
the
son
of
god
is
free
to
do
this
for
us
jesus
was
born
and
remains
born
to
all
the
ages
when
misery
drives
a
man
to
call
out
to
the
source
of
his
life
and
i
take
the
increasing
outcry
against
existence
as
a
sign
of
the
growth
of
the
race
toward
a
sense
of
the
need
of
regeneration
the
answer
i
think
will
come
in
a
quickening
of
his
conscience
this
earnest
of
the
promised
deliverance
may
not
in
all
probability
will
not
be
what
the
man
desires
he
will
want
only
to
be
rid
of
his
suffering
but
that
he
can
not
have
save
in
being
delivered
from
its
essential
root
a
thing
infinitely
worse
than
any
suffering
it
can
produce
if
he
will
not
have
that
deliverance
he
must
keep
his
suffering
through
chastisement
he
will
take
at
last
the
only
way
that
leads
into
the
liberty
of
that
which
is
and
must
be
there
can
be
no
deliverance
but
to
come
out
of
his
evil
dream
into
the
glory
of
god
it
is
true
that
jesus
came
in
delivering
us
from
our
sins
to
deliver
us
also
from
the
painful
consequences
of
our
sins
but
these
consequences
exist
by
the
one
law
of
the
universe
the
true
will
of
the
perfect
that
broken
that
disobeyed
by
the
creature
disorganization
renders
suffering
inevitable
it
is
the
natural
consequence
of
the
unnatural
and
in
the
perfection
of
god
creation
the
result
is
curative
of
the
cause
the
pain
at
least
tends
to
the
healing
of
the
breach
the
lord
never
came
to
deliver
men
from
the
consequences
of
their
sins
while
yet
those
sins
remained
that
would
be
to
cast
out
of
window
the
medicine
of
cure
while
yet
the
man
lay
sick
to
go
dead
against
the
very
laws
of
being
yet
men
loving
their
sins
and
feeling
nothing
of
their
dread
hatefulness
have
consistently
with
their
low
condition
constantly
taken
this
word
concerning
the
lord
to
mean
that
he
came
to
save
them
from
the
punishment
of
their
sins
the
idea
the
miserable
fancy
rather
has
terribly
corrupted
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
the
message
of
the
good
news
has
not
been
truly
delivered
unable
to
believe
in
the
forgiveness
of
their
father
in
heaven
imagining
him
not
at
liberty
to
forgive
or
incapable
of
forgiving
forthright
not
really
believing
him
god
our
saviour
but
a
god
bound
either
in
his
own
nature
or
by
a
law
above
him
and
compulsory
upon
him
to
exact
some
recompense
or
satisfaction
for
sin
a
multitude
of
teaching
men
have
taught
their
fellows
that
jesus
came
to
bear
our
punishment
and
save
us
from
hell
they
have
represented
a
result
as
the
object
of
his
mission
the
said
result
nowise
to
be
desired
by
true
man
save
as
consequent
on
the
gain
of
his
object
the
mission
of
jesus
was
from
the
same
source
and
with
the
same
object
as
the
punishment
of
our
sins
he
came
to
work
along
with
our
punishment
he
came
to
side
with
it
and
set
us
free
from
our
sins
no
man
is
safe
from
hell
until
he
is
free
from
his
sins
but
a
man
to
whom
his
sins
that
is
the
evil
things
in
him
are
a
burden
while
he
may
indeed
sometimes
feel
as
if
he
were
in
hell
will
soon
have
forgotten
that
ever
he
had
any
other
hell
to
think
of
than
that
of
his
sinful
condition
for
to
him
his
sins
are
hell
he
would
go
to
the
other
hell
to
be
free
of
them
free
of
them
hell
itself
would
be
endurable
to
him
for
hell
is
god
and
not
the
devil
hell
is
on
the
side
of
god
and
man
to
free
the
child
of
god
from
the
corruption
of
death
not
one
soul
will
ever
be
redeemed
from
hell
but
by
being
saved
from
his
sins
from
the
evil
in
him
if
hell
be
needful
to
save
him
hell
will
blaze
and
the
worm
will
writhe
and
bite
until
he
takes
refuge
in
the
will
of
the
father
from
hell
is
salvation
as
conceived
by
such
to
whom
hell
and
not
evil
is
the
terror
but
if
even
for
dread
of
hell
a
poor
soul
seek
the
father
he
will
be
heard
of
him
in
his
terror
and
taught
of
him
to
seek
the
immeasurably
greater
gift
will
in
the
greater
receive
the
less
there
is
another
important
misapprehension
of
the
words
of
the
messengers
of
the
good
tidings
that
they
threaten
us
with
punishment
because
of
the
sins
we
have
committed
whereas
their
message
is
of
forgiveness
not
of
vengeance
of
deliverance
not
of
evil
to
come
not
for
anything
he
has
committed
do
they
threaten
a
man
with
the
outer
darkness
not
for
any
or
all
of
his
sins
that
are
past
shall
a
man
be
condemned
not
for
the
worst
of
them
needs
he
dread
remaining
unforgiven
the
sin
he
dwells
in
the
sin
he
will
not
come
out
of
is
the
sole
ruin
of
a
man
his
present
his
live
sins
those
pervading
his
thoughts
and
ruling
his
conduct
the
sins
he
keeps
doing
and
will
not
give
up
the
sins
he
is
called
to
abandon
and
clings
to
the
same
sins
which
are
the
cause
of
his
misery
though
he
may
not
know
it
these
are
they
for
which
he
is
even
now
condemned
it
is
true
the
memory
of
the
wrongs
we
have
done
is
or
will
become
very
bitter
but
not
for
those
is
condemnation
and
if
that
in
our
character
which
made
them
possible
were
abolished
remorse
would
lose
its
worst
bitterness
in
the
hope
of
future
amends
is
the
condemnation
that
light
is
come
into
the
world
and
men
loved
darkness
rather
than
light
because
their
deeds
were
evil
it
is
the
indwelling
badness
ready
to
produce
bad
actions
that
we
need
to
be
delivered
from
against
this
badness
if
a
man
will
not
strive
he
is
left
to
commit
evil
and
reap
the
consequences
to
be
saved
from
these
consequences
would
be
no
deliverance
it
would
be
an
immediate
ever
deepening
damnation
it
is
the
evil
in
our
being
no
essential
part
of
it
thank
god
the
miserable
fact
that
the
very
child
of
god
does
not
care
for
his
father
and
will
not
obey
him
causing
us
to
desire
wrongly
act
wrongly
or
where
we
try
not
to
act
wrongly
yet
making
it
impossible
for
us
not
to
feel
wrongly
this
is
what
he
came
to
deliver
us
from
not
the
things
we
have
done
but
the
possibility
of
doing
such
things
any
more
with
the
departure
of
this
possibility
and
with
the
hope
of
confession
hereafter
to
those
we
have
wronged
will
depart
also
the
power
over
us
of
the
evil
things
we
have
done
and
so
we
shall
be
saved
from
them
also
the
bad
that
lives
in
us
our
evil
judgments
our
unjust
desires
our
hate
and
pride
and
envy
and
greed
and
these
are
the
souls
of
our
sins
our
live
sins
more
terrible
than
the
bodies
of
our
sins
namely
the
deeds
we
do
inasmuch
as
they
not
only
produce
these
loathsome
things
but
make
us
loathsome
as
they
our
wrong
deeds
are
our
dead
works
our
evil
thoughts
are
our
live
sins
these
the
essential
opposites
of
faith
and
love
the
sins
that
dwell
and
work
in
us
are
the
sins
from
which
jesus
came
to
deliver
us
when
we
turn
against
them
and
refuse
to
obey
them
they
rise
in
fierce
insistence
but
the
same
moment
begin
to
die
we
are
then
on
the
lord
side
as
he
has
always
been
on
ours
and
he
begins
to
deliver
us
from
them
anything
in
you
which
in
your
own
child
would
make
you
feel
him
not
so
pleasant
as
you
would
have
him
is
something
wrong
this
may
mean
much
to
one
little
or
nothing
to
another
things
in
a
child
which
to
one
parent
would
not
seem
worth
minding
would
fill
another
with
horror
after
his
moral
development
where
the
one
parent
would
smile
the
other
would
look
aghast
perceiving
both
the
present
evil
and
the
to
follow
but
as
the
love
of
him
who
is
love
transcends
ours
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
so
must
he
desire
in
his
child
infinitely
more
than
the
most
jealous
love
of
the
best
mother
can
desire
in
hers
he
would
have
him
rid
of
all
discontent
all
fear
all
grudging
all
bitterness
in
word
or
thought
all
gauging
and
measuring
of
his
own
with
a
different
rod
from
that
he
would
apply
to
another
he
will
have
no
curling
of
the
lip
no
indifference
in
him
to
the
man
whose
service
in
any
form
he
uses
no
desire
to
excel
another
no
contentment
at
gaining
by
his
loss
he
will
not
have
him
receive
the
smallest
service
without
gratitude
would
not
hear
from
him
a
tone
to
jar
the
heart
of
another
a
word
to
make
it
ache
be
the
ache
ever
so
transient
from
such
as
from
all
other
sins
jesus
was
born
to
deliver
us
not
primarily
or
by
itself
from
the
punishment
of
any
of
them
when
all
are
gone
the
holy
punishment
will
have
departed
also
he
came
to
make
us
good
and
therein
blessed
children
one
is
at
the
root
of
all
the
rest
it
is
no
individual
action
or
anything
that
comes
of
mood
or
passion
it
is
the
by
the
man
and
consequent
inactivity
in
him
of
the
highest
of
all
relations
that
relation
which
is
the
root
and
first
essential
condition
of
every
other
true
relation
of
or
in
the
human
soul
it
is
the
absence
in
the
man
of
harmony
with
the
being
whose
thought
is
the
man
existence
whose
word
is
the
man
power
of
thought
it
is
true
that
being
thus
his
offspring
god
as
st
paul
affirms
can
not
be
far
from
any
one
of
us
were
we
not
in
closest
contact
of
creating
and
created
we
could
not
exist
as
we
have
in
us
no
power
to
be
so
have
we
none
to
continue
being
but
there
is
a
closer
contact
still
as
absolutely
necessary
to
our
and
highest
existence
as
the
other
to
our
being
at
all
to
the
mere
capacity
of
faring
well
or
for
the
highest
creation
of
god
in
man
is
his
will
and
until
the
highest
in
man
meets
the
highest
in
god
their
true
relation
is
not
yet
a
spiritual
fact
the
flower
lies
in
the
root
but
the
root
is
not
the
flower
the
relation
exists
but
while
one
of
the
parties
neither
knows
loves
nor
acts
upon
it
the
relation
is
as
it
were
yet
unborn
the
highest
in
man
is
neither
his
intellect
nor
his
imagination
nor
his
reason
all
are
inferior
to
his
will
and
indeed
in
a
grand
way
dependent
upon
it
his
will
must
meet
god
a
will
from
god
else
were
no
possible
between
them
not
the
less
therefore
but
the
more
is
all
god
for
god
creates
in
the
man
the
power
to
will
his
will
it
may
cost
god
a
suffering
man
can
never
know
to
bring
the
man
to
the
point
at
which
he
will
will
his
will
but
when
he
is
brought
to
that
point
and
declares
for
the
truth
that
is
for
the
will
of
god
he
becomes
one
with
god
and
the
end
of
god
in
the
man
creation
the
end
for
which
jesus
was
born
and
died
is
gained
the
man
is
saved
from
his
sins
and
the
universe
flowers
yet
again
in
his
redemption
but
i
would
not
be
supposed
from
what
i
have
said
to
imagine
the
lord
without
sympathy
for
the
sorrows
and
pains
which
reveal
what
sin
is
and
by
means
of
which
he
would
make
men
sick
of
sin
with
everything
human
he
sympathizes
evil
is
not
human
it
is
the
defect
and
opposite
of
the
human
but
the
suffering
that
follows
it
is
human
belonging
of
necessity
to
the
human
that
has
sinned
while
it
is
by
cause
of
sin
suffering
is
the
sinner
that
he
may
be
delivered
from
his
sin
jesus
is
in
himself
aware
of
every
human
pain
he
feels
it
also
in
him
too
it
is
pain
with
the
energy
of
tenderest
love
he
wills
his
brothers
and
sisters
free
that
he
may
fill
them
to
overflowing
with
that
essential
thing
joy
for
that
they
were
indeed
created
but
the
moment
they
exist
truth
becomes
the
first
thing
not
happiness
and
he
must
make
them
true
were
it
possible
however
for
pain
to
continue
after
evil
was
gone
he
would
never
rest
while
one
ache
was
yet
in
the
world
perfect
in
sympathy
he
feels
in
himself
i
say
the
tortured
presence
of
every
nerve
that
lacks
its
repose
the
man
may
recognize
the
evil
in
him
only
as
pain
he
may
know
little
and
care
nothing
about
his
sins
yet
is
the
lord
sorry
for
his
pain
he
cries
aloud
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
he
does
not
say
unto
me
all
ye
that
feel
the
burden
of
your
sins
he
opens
his
arms
to
all
weary
enough
to
come
to
him
in
the
poorest
hope
of
rest
right
gladly
would
he
free
them
from
their
misery
but
he
knows
only
one
way
he
will
teach
them
to
be
like
himself
meek
and
lowly
bearing
with
gladness
the
yoke
of
his
will
this
is
the
one
the
only
right
the
only
possible
way
of
freeing
them
from
their
sins
the
cause
of
their
unrest
with
them
the
weariness
comes
first
with
him
the
sins
there
is
but
one
cure
for
both
the
will
of
the
father
that
which
is
his
joy
will
be
their
deliverance
he
might
indeed
it
may
be
take
from
them
the
human
send
them
down
to
some
lower
stage
of
being
and
so
free
them
from
suffering
but
that
must
be
either
a
descent
toward
annihilation
or
a
fresh
beginning
to
grow
up
again
toward
the
region
of
suffering
they
have
left
for
that
which
is
not
growing
must
at
length
die
out
of
creation
the
disobedient
and
selfish
would
fain
in
the
hell
of
their
hearts
possess
the
liberty
and
gladness
that
belong
to
purity
and
love
but
they
can
not
have
them
they
are
weary
and
both
with
what
they
are
and
because
of
what
they
were
made
for
but
are
not
the
lord
knows
what
they
need
they
know
only
what
they
want
they
want
ease
he
knows
they
need
purity
their
very
existence
is
an
evil
of
which
but
for
his
resolve
to
purify
them
their
maker
must
rid
his
universe
how
can
he
keep
in
his
sight
a
foul
presence
must
the
creator
send
forth
his
virtue
to
hold
alive
a
thing
that
will
be
evil
a
thing
that
ought
not
to
be
that
has
no
claim
but
to
cease
the
lord
himself
would
not
live
save
with
an
existence
absolutely
good
it
may
be
my
reader
will
desire
me
to
say
the
lord
will
deliver
him
from
his
sins
that
is
like
the
lawyer
is
my
neighbour
the
spirit
of
such
a
mode
of
receiving
the
offer
of
the
lord
deliverance
is
the
root
of
all
the
horrors
of
a
corrupt
theology
so
acceptable
to
those
who
love
weak
and
beggarly
hornbooks
of
religion
such
questions
spring
from
the
passion
for
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
not
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
men
would
understand
they
do
not
care
to
understand
where
it
is
impossible
they
should
understand
save
by
obeying
they
would
search
into
the
work
of
the
lord
instead
of
doing
their
part
in
it
thus
making
it
impossible
both
for
the
lord
to
go
on
with
his
work
and
for
themselves
to
become
capable
of
seeing
and
understanding
what
he
does
instead
of
immediately
obeying
the
lord
of
life
the
one
condition
upon
which
he
can
help
them
and
in
itself
the
beginning
of
their
deliverance
they
set
themselves
to
question
their
unenlightened
intellects
as
to
his
plans
for
their
deliverance
and
not
merely
how
he
means
to
effect
it
but
how
he
can
be
able
to
effect
it
they
would
bind
their
samson
until
they
have
scanned
his
limbs
and
thews
incapable
of
understanding
the
first
motions
of
freedom
in
themselves
they
proceed
to
interpret
the
riches
of
his
divine
soul
in
terms
of
their
own
beggarly
notions
to
paraphrase
his
glorious
verse
into
their
own
paltry
commercial
prose
and
then
in
the
growing
presumption
of
imagined
success
to
insist
upon
their
acceptance
of
their
distorted
shadows
of
plan
of
salvation
as
the
truth
of
him
in
whom
is
no
darkness
and
the
one
condition
of
their
acceptance
with
him
they
delay
setting
their
foot
on
the
stair
which
alone
can
lead
them
to
the
house
of
wisdom
until
they
shall
have
determined
the
material
and
mode
of
its
construction
for
the
sake
of
knowing
they
postpone
that
which
alone
can
enable
them
to
know
and
substitute
for
the
true
understanding
which
lies
beyond
a
false
persuasion
that
they
already
understand
they
will
not
accept
that
is
act
upon
their
highest
privilege
that
of
obeying
the
son
of
god
it
is
on
them
that
do
his
will
that
the
day
dawns
to
them
the
arises
in
their
hearts
obedience
is
the
soul
of
knowledge
by
obedience
i
intend
no
kind
of
obedience
to
man
or
submission
to
authority
claimed
by
man
or
community
of
men
i
mean
obedience
to
the
will
of
the
father
however
revealed
in
our
conscience
god
forbid
i
should
seem
to
despise
understanding
the
new
testament
is
full
of
urgings
to
understand
our
whole
life
to
be
life
at
all
must
be
a
growth
in
understanding
what
i
cry
out
upon
is
the
misunderstanding
that
comes
of
man
endeavour
to
understand
while
not
obeying
upon
obedience
our
energy
must
be
spent
understanding
will
follow
not
anxious
to
know
our
duty
or
knowing
it
and
not
doing
it
how
shall
we
understand
that
which
only
a
true
heart
and
a
clean
soul
can
ever
understand
the
power
in
us
that
would
understand
were
it
free
lies
in
the
bonds
of
imperfection
and
impurity
and
is
therefore
incapable
of
judging
the
divine
it
can
not
see
the
truth
if
it
could
see
it
it
would
not
know
it
and
would
not
have
it
until
a
man
begins
to
obey
the
light
that
is
in
him
is
darkness
any
honest
soul
may
understand
this
much
however
for
it
is
a
thing
we
may
of
ourselves
judge
to
be
right
that
the
lord
can
not
save
a
man
from
his
sins
while
he
holds
to
his
sins
an
omnipotence
that
could
do
and
not
do
the
same
thing
at
the
same
moment
were
an
idea
too
absurd
for
mockery
an
omnipotence
that
could
at
once
make
a
man
a
free
man
and
leave
him
a
slave
make
him
the
very
likeness
of
god
and
good
only
because
he
could
not
help
being
good
would
be
an
idea
of
the
same
character
equally
absurd
equally
but
the
lord
is
not
unreasonable
he
requires
no
high
motives
where
such
could
not
yet
exist
he
does
not
say
must
be
sorry
for
your
sins
or
you
need
not
come
to
me
to
be
sorry
for
his
sins
a
man
must
love
god
and
man
and
love
is
the
very
thing
that
has
to
be
developed
in
him
it
is
but
common
sense
that
a
man
longing
to
be
freed
from
suffering
or
made
able
to
bear
it
should
betake
himself
to
the
power
by
whom
he
is
equally
is
it
common
sense
that
if
a
man
would
be
delivered
from
the
evil
in
him
he
must
himself
begin
to
cast
it
out
himself
begin
to
disobey
it
and
work
righteousness
as
much
as
either
is
it
common
sense
that
a
man
should
look
for
and
expect
the
help
of
his
father
in
the
endeavour
alone
he
might
labour
to
all
eternity
and
not
succeed
he
who
has
not
made
himself
can
not
set
himself
right
without
him
who
made
him
but
his
maker
is
in
him
and
is
his
strength
the
man
however
who
instead
of
doing
what
he
is
told
broods
speculating
on
the
metaphysics
of
him
who
calls
him
to
his
work
stands
leaning
his
back
against
the
door
by
which
the
lord
would
enter
to
help
him
the
moment
he
sets
about
putting
straight
the
thing
that
is
crooked
i
mean
doing
right
where
he
has
been
doing
wrong
he
withdraws
from
the
entrance
gives
way
for
the
master
to
come
in
he
can
not
make
himself
pure
but
he
can
leave
that
which
is
impure
he
can
spread
out
the
discoloured
web
of
his
life
before
the
bleaching
sun
of
righteousness
he
can
not
save
himself
but
he
can
let
the
lord
save
him
the
struggle
of
his
weakness
is
as
essential
to
the
coming
victory
as
the
strength
of
him
who
resisted
unto
death
striving
against
sin
the
sum
of
the
whole
matter
is
this
the
son
has
come
from
the
father
to
set
the
children
free
from
their
sins
the
children
must
hear
and
obey
him
that
he
may
send
forth
judgment
unto
victory
son
of
our
father
help
us
to
do
what
thou
sayest
and
so
with
thee
die
unto
sin
that
we
may
rise
to
the
sonship
for
which
we
were
created
help
us
to
repent
even
to
the
sending
away
of
our
sins
remission
of
john
did
baptize
in
the
wilderness
and
preach
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
i
god
and
man
must
combine
for
salvation
from
sin
and
the
same
word
here
and
elsewhere
translated
seems
to
be
employed
in
the
new
testament
for
the
share
of
either
in
the
great
deliverance
but
first
let
me
say
something
concerning
the
word
here
and
everywhere
translated
i
would
not
even
suggest
a
mistranslation
but
the
idea
intended
by
the
word
has
been
so
misunderstood
and
therefore
mistaught
that
it
requires
some
consideration
of
the
word
itself
to
get
at
a
right
recognition
of
the
moral
fact
it
represents
the
greek
word
then
of
which
the
word
is
the
accepted
synonym
and
fundamentally
the
accurate
rendering
is
made
up
of
two
words
the
conjoint
meaning
of
which
is
change
of
or
there
is
in
it
no
intent
of
or
hint
at
or
or
any
other
of
the
mental
conditions
that
not
unfrequently
accompanying
repentance
have
been
taken
for
essential
parts
of
it
sometimes
for
its
very
essence
here
the
last
of
the
prophets
or
the
evangelist
who
records
his
doings
qualifies
the
word
as
if
he
held
it
insufficient
in
itself
to
convey
the
baptist
meaning
with
the
three
words
that
follow
it
greek
eis
aphesin
amartiôn
kaerussôn
baptisma
metauoias
eis
aphesin
amartiôn
a
baptism
of
repentance
a
sending
away
of
i
do
not
say
the
phrase
greek
aphesis
amartiôn
never
means
one
form
at
least
of
sending
away
of
sins
neither
do
i
say
that
the
taking
of
the
phrase
to
mean
for
the
remission
of
namely
repentance
in
order
to
obtain
the
pardon
of
god
involves
any
inconsistency
but
i
say
that
the
word
greek
eis
rather
than
that
the
word
greek
aphesis
translated
means
fundamentally
a
away
a
and
that
the
writer
seems
to
use
the
added
phrase
to
make
certain
what
he
means
by
a
repentance
namely
that
reaches
to
the
sending
away
or
abjurement
of
sins
i
do
not
think
change
of
mind
unto
the
remission
or
pardon
of
would
be
nearly
so
logical
a
phrase
as
change
of
mind
unto
the
dismission
of
the
revised
version
refuses
the
word
and
chooses
though
it
retains
which
word
now
conveys
no
meaning
except
the
forgiveness
of
god
i
think
that
here
the
same
word
is
used
for
man
dismission
of
his
sins
as
is
elsewhere
used
for
god
dismission
or
remission
of
them
in
both
uses
it
is
a
sending
away
of
sins
with
the
difference
of
meaning
that
comes
from
the
differing
sources
of
the
action
both
god
and
man
send
away
sins
but
in
the
one
case
god
sends
away
the
sins
of
the
man
and
in
the
other
the
man
sends
away
his
own
sins
i
do
not
enter
into
the
question
whether
god
aphesis
may
or
may
not
mean
as
well
the
sending
of
his
sins
out
of
a
man
as
the
pardon
of
them
whether
it
may
not
sometimes
mean
and
sometimes
i
am
sure
the
one
deed
can
not
be
separated
from
the
other
that
the
phrase
here
intends
repentance
unto
the
ceasing
from
sin
the
giving
up
of
what
is
wrong
i
will
try
to
show
at
least
probable
in
the
first
place
the
user
of
the
phrase
either
defines
the
change
of
mind
he
means
as
one
that
has
for
its
object
the
pardon
of
god
or
as
one
that
reaches
to
a
new
life
the
latter
seems
to
me
the
more
natural
interpretation
by
far
the
kind
and
scope
of
the
repentance
or
change
and
not
any
end
to
be
gained
by
it
appears
intended
the
change
must
be
one
of
will
and
conduct
a
radical
change
of
life
on
the
part
of
the
man
he
must
repent
that
is
change
his
mind
not
to
a
different
opinion
not
even
to
a
mere
betterment
of
his
conduct
not
to
anything
less
than
a
sending
away
of
his
sins
this
interpretation
of
the
preaching
of
the
baptist
seems
to
me
i
repeat
the
more
direct
the
fuller
of
meaning
the
more
logical
next
in
st
matthew
gospel
the
baptist
buttressing
argument
or
imminent
motive
for
the
change
he
is
pressing
upon
the
people
is
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
the
king
of
heaven
is
coming
you
must
give
up
your
sinning
the
same
argument
for
immediate
action
lies
in
his
quotation
from
isaiah
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
the
only
true
the
only
possible
preparation
for
the
coming
lord
is
to
cease
from
doing
evil
and
begin
to
do
well
to
send
away
sin
they
must
cleanse
not
the
streets
of
their
cities
not
their
houses
or
their
garments
or
even
their
persons
but
their
hearts
and
their
doings
it
is
true
the
baptist
did
not
see
that
the
kingdom
coming
was
not
of
this
world
but
of
the
higher
world
in
the
hearts
of
men
it
is
true
that
his
faith
failed
him
in
his
imprisonment
because
he
heard
of
no
martial
movement
on
the
part
of
the
lord
no
assertion
of
his
sovereignty
no
convincing
show
of
his
power
but
he
did
see
plainly
that
righteousness
was
essential
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
he
did
not
yet
perceive
that
righteousness
the
kingdom
of
heaven
that
he
did
not
see
that
the
lord
was
already
initiating
his
kingdom
by
sending
away
sin
out
of
the
hearts
of
his
people
is
not
wonderful
the
lord
answer
to
his
message
of
doubt
was
to
send
his
messenger
back
an
of
what
he
was
doing
so
to
wake
or
clarify
in
him
the
perception
that
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this
world
that
he
dealt
with
other
means
to
another
end
than
john
had
yet
recognized
as
his
mission
or
object
for
obedient
love
in
the
heart
of
the
poorest
he
healed
or
persuaded
was
his
kingdom
come
again
observe
that
when
the
pharisees
came
to
john
he
said
to
them
forth
therefore
fruits
meet
for
repentance
is
not
this
the
same
as
unto
the
sending
away
of
your
sins
note
also
that
when
the
multitudes
came
to
the
prophet
and
all
with
the
classes
most
obnoxious
to
the
rest
the
publicans
and
the
soldiers
asked
what
he
would
have
them
do
thus
plainly
recognizing
that
something
was
required
of
them
his
instruction
was
throughout
in
the
same
direction
they
must
send
away
their
sins
and
each
must
begin
with
the
fault
that
lay
next
him
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
at
hand
they
must
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
by
beginning
to
do
as
must
be
done
in
his
kingdom
they
could
not
rid
themselves
of
their
sins
but
they
could
set
about
sending
them
away
they
could
quarrel
with
them
and
proceed
to
turn
them
out
of
the
house
the
lord
was
on
his
way
to
do
his
part
in
their
final
banishment
those
who
had
repented
to
the
sending
away
of
their
sins
he
would
baptize
with
a
holy
power
to
send
them
away
indeed
the
operant
will
to
get
rid
of
them
would
be
baptized
with
a
fire
that
should
burn
them
up
when
a
man
breaks
with
his
sins
then
the
wind
of
the
lord
fan
will
blow
them
away
the
fire
of
the
lord
heart
will
consume
them
i
think
then
that
the
part
of
the
repentant
man
and
not
the
part
of
god
in
the
sending
away
of
sins
is
intended
here
it
is
the
man
one
preparation
for
receiving
the
power
to
overcome
them
the
baptism
of
fire
not
seldom
what
comes
in
the
name
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
must
seem
even
to
one
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
no
good
news
at
all
it
does
not
draw
him
it
wakes
in
him
not
a
single
hope
he
has
no
desire
after
what
it
offers
him
as
redemption
the
god
it
gives
him
news
of
is
not
one
to
whom
he
would
draw
nearer
but
when
such
a
man
comes
to
see
that
the
very
god
must
be
his
life
the
heart
of
his
consciousness
when
he
perceives
that
rousing
himself
to
put
from
him
what
is
evil
and
do
the
duty
that
lies
at
his
door
he
may
fearlessly
claim
the
help
of
him
who
him
into
being
then
his
will
immediately
sides
with
his
conscience
he
begins
to
try
to
and
first
thing
toward
being
to
rid
himself
of
what
is
antagonistic
to
all
being
namely
multitudes
will
not
even
approach
the
appalling
task
the
labour
and
pain
of
god
is
doing
his
part
is
undergoing
the
mighty
toil
of
an
creation
endowing
men
with
power
to
be
but
few
as
yet
are
those
who
take
up
their
part
who
respond
to
the
call
of
god
who
will
to
be
who
put
forth
a
divine
effort
after
real
existence
to
the
many
the
spirit
of
the
prophet
cries
ye
and
change
your
way
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
near
you
let
your
king
possess
his
own
let
god
throne
himself
in
you
that
his
liberty
be
your
life
and
you
free
men
that
he
may
enter
clear
the
house
for
him
send
away
the
bad
things
out
of
it
depart
from
evil
and
do
good
the
duty
that
lieth
at
thy
door
do
it
be
it
great
or
small
for
indeed
in
this
region
there
is
no
great
or
small
content
with
your
wages
said
the
baptist
to
the
soldiers
to
many
people
now
the
word
would
be
your
temper
or
courteous
to
all
or
each
hold
the
other
better
than
himself
or
just
to
your
neighbour
that
you
may
love
him
to
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
we
must
bestir
ourselves
in
the
very
spot
of
the
desert
on
which
we
stand
we
must
cast
far
from
us
our
evil
thing
that
blocks
the
way
of
his
if
we
do
not
never
will
those
wheels
roll
through
our
streets
never
will
our
desert
blossom
with
his
roses
the
message
of
john
to
his
countrymen
was
then
and
is
yet
the
one
message
to
the
world
away
your
sins
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
near
some
of
us
i
can
not
say
for
i
do
not
know
who
have
already
repented
who
have
long
ago
begun
to
send
away
our
sins
need
fresh
repentance
every
day
how
many
times
a
day
god
only
knows
we
are
so
ready
to
get
upon
some
path
that
seems
to
run
parallel
with
the
narrow
way
and
then
take
no
note
of
its
divergence
what
is
there
for
us
when
we
discover
that
we
are
out
of
the
way
but
to
bethink
ourselves
and
turn
by
those
need
no
repentance
the
lord
may
have
meant
such
as
had
repented
perfectly
had
sent
away
all
their
sins
and
were
now
with
him
in
his
father
house
also
such
as
have
never
sinned
and
such
as
no
longer
turn
aside
for
any
temptation
we
shall
now
perhaps
be
able
to
understand
the
relation
of
the
lord
himself
to
the
baptism
of
john
he
came
to
john
to
be
baptized
and
most
would
say
john
baptism
was
of
repentance
for
the
remission
or
pardon
of
sins
but
the
lord
could
not
be
baptized
for
the
remission
of
sins
for
he
had
never
done
a
selfish
an
untrue
or
an
unfair
thing
he
had
never
wronged
his
father
any
more
than
ever
his
father
had
wronged
him
happy
happy
son
and
father
who
had
never
either
done
the
other
wrong
in
thought
word
or
deed
as
little
had
he
wronged
brother
or
sister
he
needed
no
forgiveness
there
was
nothing
to
forgive
no
more
could
he
be
baptized
for
repentance
in
him
repentance
would
have
been
to
turn
to
evil
where
then
was
the
propriety
of
his
coming
to
be
baptized
by
john
and
insisting
on
being
by
him
baptized
it
must
lie
elsewhere
if
we
take
the
words
of
john
to
mean
baptism
of
repentance
unto
the
sending
away
of
sins
and
if
we
bear
in
mind
that
in
his
case
repentance
could
not
be
inasmuch
as
what
repentance
is
necessary
to
bring
about
in
man
was
already
existent
in
jesus
then
altering
the
words
to
fit
the
case
and
saying
baptism
of
willed
devotion
to
the
sending
away
of
sin
we
shall
see
at
once
how
the
baptism
of
jesus
was
a
thing
right
and
fit
that
he
had
no
sin
to
repent
of
was
not
because
he
was
so
constituted
that
he
could
not
sin
if
he
would
it
was
because
of
his
own
will
and
judgment
he
sent
sin
away
from
him
sent
it
from
him
with
the
full
choice
and
energy
of
his
nature
god
knows
good
and
evil
and
blessed
be
his
name
chooses
good
never
will
his
righteous
anger
make
him
unfair
to
us
make
him
forget
that
we
are
dust
like
him
his
son
also
chose
good
and
in
that
choice
resisted
all
temptation
to
help
his
fellows
otherwise
than
as
their
and
his
father
would
instead
of
crushing
the
power
of
evil
by
divine
force
instead
of
compelling
justice
and
destroying
the
wicked
instead
of
making
peace
on
the
earth
by
the
rule
of
a
perfect
prince
instead
of
gathering
the
children
of
jerusalem
under
his
wings
whether
they
would
or
not
and
saving
them
from
the
horrors
that
anguished
his
prophetic
soul
he
let
evil
work
its
will
while
it
lived
he
contented
himself
with
the
slow
unencouraging
ways
of
help
essential
making
men
good
casting
out
not
merely
controlling
satan
carrying
to
their
perfect
issue
on
earth
the
old
primeval
principles
because
of
which
the
father
honoured
him
hast
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
therefore
god
even
thy
god
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows
to
love
righteousness
is
to
make
it
grow
not
to
avenge
it
and
to
win
for
righteousness
the
true
victory
he
as
well
as
his
brethren
had
to
send
away
evil
throughout
his
life
on
earth
he
resisted
every
impulse
to
work
more
rapidly
for
a
lower
good
strong
perhaps
when
he
saw
old
age
and
innocence
and
righteousness
trodden
under
foot
what
but
this
gives
any
worth
of
reality
to
the
temptation
in
the
wilderness
to
the
devil
departing
from
him
for
a
season
to
his
coming
again
to
experience
a
like
failure
ever
and
ever
in
the
whole
attitude
of
his
being
in
his
heart
always
lifted
up
in
his
unfailing
readiness
to
pull
with
the
father
yoke
he
was
repelling
driving
away
sin
away
from
himself
and
as
lord
of
men
and
their
saviour
away
from
others
also
bringing
them
to
abjure
it
like
himself
no
man
least
of
all
any
lord
of
men
can
be
good
without
willing
to
be
good
without
setting
himself
against
evil
without
sending
away
sin
other
men
have
to
send
it
away
out
of
them
the
lord
had
to
send
it
away
from
before
him
that
it
should
not
enter
into
him
therefore
is
the
stand
against
sin
common
to
the
captain
of
salvation
and
the
soldiers
under
him
what
did
jesus
come
into
the
world
to
do
the
will
of
god
in
saving
his
people
from
their
sins
not
from
the
punishment
of
their
sins
that
blessed
aid
to
repentance
but
from
their
sins
themselves
the
paltry
as
well
as
the
heinous
the
venial
as
well
as
the
loathsome
his
whole
work
was
and
is
to
send
away
sin
to
banish
it
from
the
earth
yea
to
cast
it
into
the
abyss
of
behind
the
back
of
god
his
was
the
holy
war
he
came
carrying
it
into
our
world
he
resisted
unto
blood
the
soldiers
that
followed
him
he
taught
and
trained
to
resist
also
unto
blood
striving
against
sin
so
he
became
the
captain
of
their
salvation
and
they
freed
themselves
fought
and
suffered
for
others
this
was
the
task
to
which
he
was
baptized
this
is
yet
his
enduring
labour
is
my
blood
of
the
new
covenant
which
is
shed
for
many
unto
the
sending
away
of
sins
what
was
the
new
covenant
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
not
according
to
the
covenant
which
they
brake
but
this
i
will
put
my
law
in
their
inward
parts
and
write
it
in
their
hearts
and
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
john
baptized
unto
repentance
because
those
to
whom
he
was
sent
had
to
repent
they
must
bethink
themselves
and
send
away
the
sin
that
was
in
them
but
had
there
been
a
man
aware
of
no
sin
in
him
but
aware
that
life
would
be
no
life
were
not
sin
kept
out
of
him
that
man
would
have
been
right
in
receiving
the
baptism
of
john
unto
the
continuous
dismission
of
the
sin
ever
wanting
to
enter
in
at
his
door
the
object
of
the
baptism
was
the
sending
away
of
sin
its
object
was
repentance
only
where
necessary
to
only
as
introducing
as
resulting
in
that
he
to
whom
john
was
not
sent
he
whom
he
did
not
call
he
who
needed
no
repentance
was
baptized
for
the
same
object
to
the
same
conflict
for
the
same
end
the
banishment
of
sin
from
the
dominions
of
his
father
and
that
first
by
his
own
sternest
repudiation
of
it
in
himself
thence
came
his
victory
in
the
wilderness
he
would
have
his
fathers
way
not
his
own
could
he
be
less
fitted
to
receive
the
baptism
of
john
that
the
object
of
it
was
no
new
thing
with
him
who
had
been
about
it
from
the
beginning
yea
from
all
eternity
we
shall
be
about
it
i
presume
to
all
eternity
such
then
as
were
baptized
by
john
were
initiated
into
the
company
of
those
whose
work
was
to
send
sin
out
of
the
world
and
first
by
sending
it
out
of
themselves
by
having
done
with
it
their
earliest
endeavour
in
this
direction
would
as
i
have
said
open
the
door
for
that
help
to
enter
without
which
a
man
could
never
succeed
in
the
divinely
arduous
task
could
not
because
the
region
in
which
the
work
has
to
be
wrought
lies
in
the
very
roots
of
his
own
being
where
knowing
nothing
of
the
secrets
of
his
essential
existence
he
can
immediately
do
nothing
where
the
maker
of
him
alone
is
potent
alone
is
consciously
present
the
change
that
must
pass
in
him
more
than
equals
a
new
creation
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
higher
creation
but
its
necessity
is
involved
in
the
former
creation
and
thence
we
have
a
right
to
ask
help
of
our
creator
for
he
requires
of
us
what
he
has
created
us
unable
to
effect
without
him
nay
nay
could
we
do
anything
without
him
it
were
a
thing
to
leave
undone
blessed
fact
that
he
hath
made
us
so
near
him
that
the
scale
of
our
being
is
so
large
that
we
are
completed
only
by
his
presence
in
it
that
we
are
not
men
without
him
that
we
can
be
one
with
our
creator
that
we
are
not
cut
off
from
the
original
infinite
that
in
him
we
must
share
infinitude
or
be
enslaved
by
the
finite
the
very
patent
of
our
royalty
is
that
not
for
a
moment
can
we
live
our
true
life
without
the
eternal
life
present
in
and
with
our
spirits
without
him
at
our
unknown
root
we
cease
to
be
true
a
dog
can
not
live
without
the
presence
of
god
but
i
presume
a
dog
may
live
a
good
without
knowing
the
presence
of
his
origin
man
is
dead
if
he
know
not
the
power
which
is
his
cause
his
deepest
selfing
self
the
presence
which
is
not
himself
and
is
nearer
to
him
than
himself
which
is
infinitely
more
himself
more
his
very
being
than
he
is
himself
the
being
of
which
we
are
conscious
is
not
our
full
self
the
extent
of
our
consciousness
of
our
self
is
no
measure
of
our
self
our
consciousness
is
infinitely
less
than
we
while
god
is
more
necessary
even
to
that
poor
consciousness
of
self
than
our
is
necessary
to
our
humanity
until
a
man
become
the
power
of
his
own
existence
become
his
own
god
the
sole
thing
necessary
to
his
existing
is
the
will
of
god
for
the
and
perfecting
of
that
existence
the
sole
thing
necessary
is
that
the
man
should
know
his
maker
present
in
him
all
that
the
children
want
is
their
father
the
one
true
end
of
all
speech
concerning
holy
things
is
the
persuading
of
the
individual
man
to
cease
to
do
evil
to
set
himself
to
do
well
to
look
to
the
lord
of
his
life
to
be
on
his
side
in
the
new
struggle
supposing
the
suggestions
i
have
made
correct
i
do
not
care
that
my
reader
should
understand
them
except
it
be
to
turn
against
the
evil
in
him
and
begin
to
cast
it
out
if
this
be
not
the
result
it
is
of
no
smallest
consequence
whether
he
agree
with
my
interpretation
or
not
if
he
do
thus
repent
it
is
of
equally
little
consequence
for
setting
himself
to
do
the
truth
he
is
on
the
way
to
know
all
things
real
knowledge
has
begun
to
grow
possible
for
him
i
am
not
sure
what
the
lord
means
in
the
words
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
baptism
could
not
be
the
fulfilling
of
all
righteousness
perhaps
he
means
must
by
a
full
act
of
the
will
give
ourselves
altogether
to
righteousness
we
must
make
it
the
business
of
our
lives
to
send
away
sin
and
do
the
will
of
the
father
that
is
my
work
as
much
as
the
work
of
any
man
who
must
repent
ere
he
can
begin
i
will
not
be
left
out
when
you
call
men
to
be
pure
as
our
father
is
pure
to
be
certain
whom
he
intends
by
might
perhaps
help
us
to
see
his
meaning
does
he
intend
of
us
does
he
intend
father
and
me
or
does
he
intend
and
me
john
if
the
saying
mean
what
i
have
suggested
then
the
would
apply
to
all
that
have
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
being
that
can
must
devote
himself
to
righteousness
to
be
right
is
no
adjunct
of
completeness
it
is
the
ground
and
foundation
of
existence
but
perhaps
it
was
a
lesson
for
john
himself
who
mighty
preacher
of
righteousness
as
he
was
did
not
yet
count
it
the
all
of
life
i
can
not
tell
note
that
when
the
lord
began
his
teaching
he
employed
neither
using
nor
inculcating
any
rite
the
same
words
as
john
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
that
kingdom
had
been
at
hand
all
his
infancy
boyhood
and
young
manhood
he
was
in
the
world
with
his
father
in
his
heart
that
was
the
kingdom
of
heaven
lonely
man
on
the
hillside
or
boy
the
cynosure
of
his
father
was
everything
to
him
ye
not
that
i
must
be
in
my
father
things
in
the
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
us
behold
thy
father
and
i
have
sought
thee
sorrowing
and
he
said
unto
them
is
it
that
ye
sought
me
wist
ye
not
that
i
must
be
about
my
father
business
and
they
understood
not
the
saying
which
he
spake
unto
ii
was
that
his
saying
why
did
they
not
understand
it
do
we
understand
it
what
did
his
saying
mean
the
greek
is
not
absolutely
clear
whether
the
syriac
words
he
used
were
more
precise
who
in
this
world
can
tell
but
had
we
heard
his
very
words
we
too
with
his
father
and
mother
would
have
failed
to
understand
them
must
we
fail
still
it
will
show
at
once
where
our
initial
difficulty
lies
if
i
give
the
latter
half
of
the
saying
as
presented
in
the
revised
english
version
its
departure
from
the
authorized
reveals
the
point
of
obscurity
ye
not
that
i
must
be
in
my
father
house
his
parents
had
his
exact
words
yet
did
not
understand
we
have
not
his
exact
words
and
are
in
doubt
as
to
what
the
greek
translation
of
them
means
if
the
authorized
translation
be
true
to
the
intent
of
the
greek
and
therefore
to
that
of
the
syriac
how
could
his
parents
knowing
him
as
they
did
from
all
that
had
been
spoken
before
concerning
him
from
all
they
had
seen
in
him
from
the
ponderings
in
mary
own
heart
and
from
the
precious
thoughts
she
and
joseph
cherished
concerning
him
have
failed
to
understand
him
when
he
said
that
wherever
he
was
he
must
be
about
his
father
business
on
the
other
hand
supposing
them
to
know
and
feel
that
he
must
be
about
his
father
business
would
that
have
been
reason
sufficient
in
view
of
the
degree
of
spiritual
development
to
which
they
had
attained
for
the
lord
expecting
them
not
to
be
anxious
about
him
when
they
had
lost
him
thousands
on
thousands
who
trust
god
for
their
friends
in
things
spiritual
do
not
trust
him
for
them
in
regard
of
their
mere
health
or
material
his
parents
knew
how
prophets
had
always
been
treated
in
the
land
or
if
they
did
not
think
in
that
direction
there
were
many
dangers
to
which
a
boy
like
him
would
seem
exposed
to
rouse
an
anxiety
that
could
be
met
only
by
a
faith
equal
to
saying
has
happened
to
him
death
itself
it
can
be
no
evil
to
one
who
is
about
his
father
business
and
such
a
faith
i
think
the
lord
could
not
yet
have
expected
of
them
that
what
the
world
counts
misfortune
might
befall
him
on
his
father
business
would
have
been
recognized
by
him
i
think
as
reason
for
their
parental
anxiety
so
long
as
they
had
not
learned
god
that
he
is
what
he
is
the
thing
the
lord
had
come
to
teach
his
father
men
and
women
his
words
seem
rather
to
imply
that
there
was
no
need
to
be
anxious
about
his
personal
safety
fear
of
some
accident
to
him
seems
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
trouble
and
he
did
not
mean
i
think
that
they
ought
not
to
mind
if
he
died
doing
his
father
will
but
that
he
was
in
no
danger
as
regarded
accident
or
misfortune
this
will
appear
more
plainly
as
we
proceed
so
much
for
the
authorized
version
let
us
now
take
the
translation
given
us
by
the
revisers
ye
not
that
i
must
be
in
my
father
house
are
they
authorized
in
translating
the
greek
thus
i
know
no
justification
for
it
but
am
not
learned
enough
to
say
they
have
none
that
the
syriac
has
it
so
is
of
little
weight
seeing
it
is
no
original
syriac
but
retranslation
if
he
did
say
father
could
he
have
meant
the
temple
and
his
parents
not
have
known
what
he
meant
and
why
should
he
have
taken
it
for
granted
they
would
know
or
judge
that
they
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
there
so
little
did
the
temple
suggest
itself
to
them
that
either
it
was
the
last
place
in
which
they
sought
him
or
they
had
been
there
before
and
had
found
him
if
he
meant
that
they
might
have
known
this
without
being
told
why
was
it
that
even
when
he
set
the
thing
before
them
they
did
not
understand
him
i
do
not
believe
he
meant
the
temple
i
do
not
think
he
said
or
meant
my
fathers
what
then
makes
those
who
give
us
this
translation
prefer
it
to
the
phrase
in
the
authorized
version
my
father
one
or
other
of
two
causes
most
likely
both
together
an
ecclesiastical
fancy
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
found
in
the
temple
a
mind
ecclesiastical
will
presume
the
temple
the
fittest
therefore
most
likely
place
for
the
son
of
god
to
betake
himself
to
but
such
a
mind
would
not
be
the
first
to
reflect
that
the
temple
was
a
place
where
the
father
was
worshipped
neither
in
spirit
nor
in
truth
a
place
built
by
one
of
the
vilest
rulers
of
this
world
less
fit
than
many
another
spot
for
the
special
presence
of
him
of
whom
the
prophet
bears
witness
saith
the
high
and
lofty
one
that
inhabiteth
eternity
whose
name
is
holy
i
dwell
in
the
high
and
holy
place
with
him
also
that
is
of
a
contrite
and
humble
spirit
to
revive
the
spirit
of
the
humble
and
to
revive
the
heart
of
the
contrite
ones
jesus
himself
with
the
same
breath
in
which
once
he
called
it
his
father
house
called
it
a
den
of
thieves
his
expulsion
from
it
of
the
buyers
and
sellers
was
the
first
waft
of
the
fan
with
which
he
was
come
to
purge
his
father
dominions
nothing
could
ever
cleanse
that
house
his
fanning
rose
to
a
tempest
and
swept
it
out
of
his
father
world
for
the
second
possible
cause
of
the
change
from
to
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
found
in
the
temple
can
hardly
be
a
reason
for
his
expecting
his
parents
to
know
that
he
was
there
and
if
it
witnessed
to
some
way
of
thought
or
habit
of
his
with
which
they
were
acquainted
it
is
i
repeat
difficult
to
see
why
the
parents
should
fail
to
perceive
what
the
interpreters
have
found
so
easily
but
the
parents
looked
for
a
larger
meaning
in
the
words
of
such
a
son
whose
meaning
at
the
same
time
was
too
large
for
them
to
find
when
according
to
the
greek
the
lord
on
the
occasion
already
alluded
to
says
father
house
he
says
it
plainly
he
uses
the
word
here
he
does
not
let
us
see
what
lies
in
the
greek
to
guide
us
to
the
thought
in
the
mind
of
the
lord
when
he
thus
reasoned
with
the
apprehensions
of
his
father
and
mother
the
greek
taken
literally
says
ye
not
that
i
must
be
in
the
of
my
father
the
authorized
version
supplies
the
revised
there
is
no
noun
in
the
greek
and
the
article
is
in
the
plural
to
translate
it
as
literally
as
it
can
be
translated
making
of
it
an
english
sentence
the
saying
stands
ye
not
that
i
must
be
in
the
things
of
my
father
the
plural
article
implies
the
english
and
the
question
is
then
what
does
he
mean
the
word
might
mean
or
but
why
the
plural
article
should
be
contracted
to
mean
do
not
know
in
a
great
wide
sense
no
doubt
the
word
might
be
used
as
i
am
about
to
show
but
surely
not
as
meaning
the
temple
he
was
arguing
for
confidence
in
god
on
the
part
of
his
parents
not
for
a
knowledge
of
his
whereabout
the
same
thing
that
made
them
anxious
concerning
him
prevented
them
from
understanding
his
words
lack
namely
of
faith
in
the
father
this
the
one
thing
he
came
into
the
world
to
teach
men
those
words
were
meant
to
teach
his
parents
they
are
spirit
and
life
involving
the
one
principle
by
which
men
shall
live
they
hold
the
same
core
as
his
words
to
his
disciples
in
the
storm
ye
of
little
faith
let
us
look
more
closely
at
them
did
you
look
for
me
did
you
not
know
that
i
must
be
among
my
father
things
what
are
we
to
understand
by
father
things
the
translation
given
in
the
authorized
version
is
i
think
as
to
the
words
themselves
a
thoroughly
justifiable
one
must
be
about
my
father
business
or
father
affairs
i
refuse
it
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
does
not
fit
the
logic
of
the
narrative
as
does
the
word
which
besides
opens
to
us
a
door
of
large
and
joyous
prospect
of
course
he
was
about
his
father
business
and
they
might
know
it
and
yet
be
anxious
about
him
not
having
a
perfect
faith
in
that
father
but
as
i
have
said
already
it
was
not
anxiety
as
to
what
might
befall
him
because
of
doing
the
will
of
the
father
he
might
well
seem
to
them
as
yet
too
young
for
danger
from
that
source
it
was
but
the
vague
perils
of
life
beyond
their
sight
that
appalled
them
theirs
was
just
the
uneasiness
that
possesses
every
parent
whose
child
is
missing
and
if
they
like
him
had
trusted
in
their
father
they
would
have
known
what
their
son
now
meant
when
he
said
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
father
things
namely
that
the
very
things
from
which
they
dreaded
evil
accident
were
his
own
that
he
was
not
doing
the
father
business
in
a
foreign
country
but
in
the
own
house
understood
as
meaning
the
world
or
the
universe
the
phrase
father
house
would
be
a
better
translation
than
the
authorized
understood
as
meaning
the
poor
miserable
temple
no
more
the
house
of
god
than
a
dead
body
is
the
house
of
a
man
it
is
immeasurably
inferior
it
seems
to
me
i
say
that
the
lord
meant
to
remind
them
or
rather
to
make
them
feel
for
they
had
not
yet
learned
the
fact
that
he
was
never
away
from
home
could
not
be
lost
as
they
had
thought
him
that
he
was
in
his
father
house
all
the
time
where
no
hurt
could
come
to
him
things
about
him
were
the
furniture
and
utensils
of
his
home
he
knew
them
all
and
how
to
use
them
must
be
among
my
belongings
the
world
was
his
home
because
his
father
house
he
was
not
a
stranger
who
did
not
know
his
way
about
in
it
he
was
no
lost
child
but
with
his
father
all
the
time
here
we
find
one
main
thing
wherein
the
lord
differs
from
us
we
are
not
at
home
in
this
great
universe
our
father
house
we
ought
to
be
and
one
day
we
shall
be
but
we
are
not
yet
this
reveals
jesus
more
than
man
by
revealing
him
more
man
than
we
we
are
not
complete
men
we
are
not
anything
near
it
and
are
therefore
out
of
harmony
more
or
less
with
everything
in
the
house
of
our
birth
and
habitation
always
struggling
to
make
our
home
in
the
world
we
have
not
yet
succeeded
we
are
not
at
home
in
it
because
we
are
not
at
home
with
the
lord
of
the
house
the
father
of
the
family
not
one
with
our
elder
brother
who
is
his
right
hand
it
is
only
the
son
the
daughter
that
abideth
ever
in
the
house
when
we
are
true
children
if
not
the
world
then
the
universe
will
be
our
home
felt
and
known
as
such
the
house
we
are
satisfied
with
and
would
not
change
hence
until
then
the
hard
struggle
the
constant
strife
we
hold
with
as
we
call
the
things
of
our
father
a
strife
invaluable
for
our
development
at
the
same
time
manifesting
us
not
yet
men
enough
to
be
lords
of
the
house
built
for
us
to
live
in
we
can
not
govern
or
command
in
it
as
did
the
lord
because
we
are
not
at
one
with
his
father
therefore
neither
in
harmony
with
his
things
nor
rulers
over
them
our
best
power
in
regard
to
them
is
but
to
find
out
wonderful
facts
concerning
them
and
their
relations
and
turn
these
facts
to
our
uses
on
systems
of
our
own
for
we
discover
what
we
seem
to
discover
by
working
inward
from
without
while
he
works
outward
from
within
and
we
shall
never
understand
the
world
until
we
see
it
in
the
direction
in
which
he
works
making
it
namely
from
within
outward
this
of
course
we
can
not
do
until
we
are
one
with
him
in
the
meantime
so
much
are
both
we
and
his
things
his
that
we
can
err
concerning
them
only
as
he
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
err
we
can
wander
only
in
the
direction
of
the
truth
if
but
to
find
that
we
can
find
nothing
think
for
a
moment
how
jesus
was
at
home
among
the
things
of
his
father
it
seems
to
me
i
repeat
a
spiritless
explanation
of
his
words
that
the
temple
was
the
place
where
naturally
he
was
at
home
does
he
make
the
least
lamentation
over
the
temple
it
is
jerusalem
he
weeps
over
the
men
of
jerusalem
the
killers
the
stoners
what
was
his
place
of
prayer
not
the
temple
but
the
where
does
he
find
symbols
whereby
to
speak
of
what
goes
on
in
the
mind
and
before
the
face
of
his
father
in
heaven
not
in
the
temple
not
in
its
rites
not
on
its
altars
not
in
its
holy
of
holies
he
finds
them
in
the
world
and
its
facts
on
the
roadside
in
the
field
in
the
vineyard
in
the
garden
in
the
house
in
the
family
and
the
commonest
of
its
affairs
the
lighting
of
the
lamp
the
leavening
of
the
meal
the
neighbour
borrowing
the
losing
of
the
coin
the
straying
of
the
sheep
even
in
the
unlovely
facts
also
of
the
world
which
he
turns
to
holy
use
such
as
the
unjust
judge
the
false
steward
the
faithless
labourers
he
ignores
the
temple
see
how
he
drives
the
devils
from
the
souls
and
bodies
of
men
as
we
the
wolves
from
our
sheepfolds
how
before
him
the
diseases
scaly
and
spotted
hurry
and
flee
the
world
has
for
him
no
chamber
of
terror
he
walks
to
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
the
sealed
cellar
of
his
father
house
and
calls
forth
its
four
days
dead
he
rebukes
the
mourners
he
stays
the
funeral
and
gives
back
the
departed
children
to
their
parents
arms
the
roughest
of
its
servants
do
not
make
him
wince
none
of
them
are
so
arrogant
as
to
disobey
his
word
he
falls
asleep
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
that
threatens
to
swallow
his
boat
hear
how
on
that
same
occasion
he
rebukes
his
disciples
the
children
to
tremble
at
a
gust
of
wind
in
the
house
little
ones
afraid
of
a
storm
hear
him
tell
the
watery
floor
to
be
still
and
no
longer
toss
his
brothers
see
the
watery
floor
obey
him
and
grow
still
see
how
the
wandering
creatures
under
it
come
at
his
call
see
him
leave
his
and
go
walking
over
its
heaving
surface
to
the
help
of
his
men
of
little
faith
see
how
the
water
turns
to
wine
how
its
bread
grows
more
bread
at
his
word
see
how
he
goes
from
the
house
for
a
while
and
returning
with
fresh
power
takes
what
shape
he
pleases
walks
through
its
closed
doors
and
goes
up
and
down
its
invisible
stairs
all
his
life
he
was
among
his
father
things
either
in
heaven
or
in
the
world
not
then
only
when
they
found
him
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
he
is
still
among
his
father
things
everywhere
about
in
the
world
everywhere
throughout
the
wide
universe
whatever
he
laid
aside
to
come
to
us
to
whatever
limitations
for
our
sake
he
stooped
his
regal
head
he
dealt
with
the
things
about
him
in
such
lordly
childlike
manner
as
made
it
clear
they
were
not
strange
to
him
but
the
things
of
his
father
he
claimed
none
of
them
as
his
own
would
not
have
had
one
of
them
his
except
through
his
father
only
as
his
father
could
he
enjoy
them
only
as
coming
forth
from
the
father
and
full
of
the
thought
and
nature
had
they
to
him
any
existence
that
the
things
were
his
fathers
made
them
precious
things
to
him
he
had
no
care
for
having
as
men
count
having
all
his
having
was
in
the
father
i
wonder
if
he
ever
put
anything
in
his
pocket
i
doubt
if
he
had
one
did
he
ever
say
is
mine
not
yours
did
he
not
say
things
are
mine
therefore
they
are
yours
oh
for
his
liberty
among
the
things
of
the
father
only
by
knowing
them
the
things
of
our
father
can
we
escape
enslaving
ourselves
to
them
through
the
false
the
infernal
idea
of
of
them
we
make
them
our
tyrants
make
the
relation
between
them
and
us
an
evil
thing
the
world
was
a
blessed
place
to
jesus
because
everything
in
it
was
his
father
what
pain
must
it
not
have
been
to
him
to
see
his
brothers
so
vilely
misuse
the
father
house
by
grasping
each
for
himself
at
the
family
things
if
the
knowledge
that
a
spot
in
the
landscape
retains
in
it
some
pollution
suffices
to
disturb
our
pleasure
in
the
whole
how
must
it
not
have
been
with
him
how
must
it
not
be
with
him
now
in
regard
to
the
disfigurements
and
defilements
caused
by
the
greed
of
men
by
their
haste
to
be
rich
in
his
father
lovely
house
whoever
is
able
to
understand
wordsworth
or
henry
vaughan
when
either
speaks
of
the
glorious
insights
of
his
childhood
will
be
able
to
imagine
a
little
how
jesus
must
in
his
eternal
childhood
regard
the
world
hear
what
wordsworth
says
our
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
the
soul
that
rises
with
us
our
life
star
hath
had
elsewhere
its
setting
and
cometh
from
afar
not
in
entire
forgetfulness
and
not
in
utter
nakedness
but
trailing
clouds
of
glory
do
we
come
from
god
who
is
our
home
heaven
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
shades
of
the
begin
to
close
upon
the
growing
boy
but
he
beholds
the
light
and
whence
it
flows
he
sees
it
in
his
joy
the
youth
who
daily
farther
from
the
east
must
travel
still
is
nature
priest
and
by
the
vision
splendid
is
on
his
way
attended
at
length
the
man
perceives
it
die
away
and
fade
into
the
light
of
common
day
hear
what
henry
vaughan
says
happy
those
early
dayes
when
i
shin
in
my
before
i
understood
this
place
appointed
for
my
second
race
or
taught
my
soul
to
fancy
ought
but
a
white
celestiall
thought
when
yet
i
had
not
walkt
above
a
mile
or
two
from
my
first
love
and
looking
back
at
that
short
space
could
see
a
glimpse
of
his
when
on
some
gilded
cloud
or
flowre
my
gazing
soul
would
dwell
an
houre
and
in
those
weaker
glories
spy
some
shadows
of
eternity
before
i
taught
my
tongue
to
wound
my
conscience
with
a
sinfull
sound
or
had
the
black
art
to
dispence
a
sinne
to
sence
but
felt
through
all
this
fleshly
dresse
bright
shootes
of
everlastingnesse
o
how
i
long
to
travell
back
and
tread
again
that
ancient
track
that
i
might
once
more
reach
that
plaine
where
first
i
left
my
glorious
traine
from
whence
th
inlightned
spirit
sees
that
shady
city
of
palme
trees
whoever
has
thus
gazed
on
flower
or
cloud
whoever
can
recall
poorest
memory
of
the
trail
of
glory
that
hung
about
his
childhood
must
have
some
faint
idea
how
his
father
house
and
the
things
in
it
always
looked
and
must
still
look
to
the
lord
with
him
there
is
no
fading
into
the
light
of
common
day
he
has
never
lost
his
childhood
the
very
essence
of
childhood
being
nearness
to
the
father
and
the
outgoing
of
his
creative
love
whence
with
that
insight
of
his
eternal
childhood
of
which
the
insight
of
the
little
ones
here
is
a
fainter
repetition
he
must
see
everything
as
the
father
means
it
the
child
sees
things
as
the
father
means
him
to
see
them
as
he
thought
of
them
when
he
uttered
them
for
god
is
not
only
the
father
of
the
child
but
of
the
childhood
that
constitutes
him
a
child
therefore
the
childness
is
of
the
divine
nature
the
child
may
not
indeed
be
capable
of
looking
into
the
method
but
he
can
in
a
measure
understand
his
work
has
therefore
free
entrance
to
his
study
and
workshop
both
and
is
welcome
to
find
out
what
he
can
with
fullest
liberty
to
ask
him
questions
there
are
men
too
who
at
their
best
see
in
their
lower
measure
things
as
they
are
as
god
sees
them
always
jesus
saw
things
just
as
his
father
saw
them
in
his
creative
imagination
when
willing
them
out
to
the
eyes
of
his
children
but
if
he
could
always
see
the
things
of
his
father
even
as
some
men
and
more
children
see
them
at
times
he
might
well
feel
at
home
among
them
he
could
not
cease
to
admire
cease
to
love
them
i
say
because
the
life
in
them
the
presence
of
the
creative
one
would
ever
be
plain
to
him
in
the
perfect
would
familiarity
ever
destroy
wonder
at
things
essentially
wonderful
because
essentially
divine
to
cease
to
wonder
is
to
fall
from
the
childlike
to
the
commonplace
the
most
undivine
of
all
moods
intellectual
our
nature
can
never
be
at
home
among
things
that
are
not
wonderful
to
us
could
we
see
things
always
as
we
have
sometimes
seen
them
and
as
one
day
we
must
always
see
them
only
far
better
should
we
ever
know
dullness
greatly
as
we
might
enjoy
all
forms
of
art
much
as
we
might
learn
through
the
eyes
and
thoughts
of
other
men
should
we
fly
to
these
for
deliverance
from
from
any
haunting
discomfort
should
we
not
just
open
our
own
look
upon
the
things
themselves
and
be
consoled
jesus
then
would
have
his
parents
understand
that
he
was
in
his
father
world
among
his
father
things
where
was
nothing
to
hurt
him
he
knew
them
all
was
in
the
secret
of
them
all
could
use
and
order
them
as
did
his
father
to
this
same
i
think
all
we
humans
are
destined
to
rise
though
so
many
of
us
now
are
ignorant
what
kind
of
home
we
need
what
a
home
we
are
capable
of
having
we
too
shall
inherit
the
earth
with
the
son
eternal
doing
with
it
as
we
would
willing
with
the
will
of
the
father
to
such
a
home
as
we
now
inhabit
only
perfected
and
perfectly
beheld
we
are
travelling
never
to
reach
it
save
by
the
obedience
that
makes
us
the
children
therefore
the
heirs
of
god
and
thank
god
there
the
father
does
not
die
that
the
children
may
inherit
for
bliss
of
heaven
we
inherit
with
the
father
all
the
dangers
of
jesus
came
from
the
priests
and
the
learned
in
the
traditional
law
whom
his
parents
had
not
yet
begun
to
fear
on
his
behalf
they
feared
the
dangers
of
the
rugged
way
the
thieves
and
robbers
of
the
for
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
the
priests
and
the
rulers
they
would
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
their
messiah
their
king
little
they
imagined
when
they
found
him
where
he
ought
to
have
been
safest
had
it
been
indeed
his
father
house
that
there
he
sat
amid
lions
the
great
doctors
of
the
temple
he
could
rule
all
the
in
his
father
house
but
not
the
men
of
religion
the
men
of
the
temple
who
called
his
father
their
father
true
he
might
have
compelled
them
with
a
word
withered
them
by
a
glance
with
a
made
them
grovel
at
his
feet
but
such
supremacy
over
his
brothers
the
lord
of
life
despised
he
must
rule
them
as
his
father
ruled
himself
he
would
have
them
know
themselves
of
the
same
family
with
himself
have
them
at
home
among
the
things
of
god
caring
for
the
things
he
cared
for
loving
and
hating
as
he
and
his
father
loved
and
hated
ruling
themselves
by
the
essential
laws
of
being
because
they
would
not
be
such
he
let
them
do
to
him
as
they
would
that
he
might
get
at
their
hearts
by
some
unknown
unguarded
door
in
their
diviner
part
will
be
god
among
you
i
will
be
myself
to
you
will
not
have
me
then
do
to
me
as
you
will
the
created
shall
have
power
over
him
through
whom
they
were
created
that
they
may
be
compelled
to
know
him
and
his
father
they
shall
look
on
him
whom
they
have
pierced
his
parents
found
him
in
the
temple
they
never
really
found
him
until
he
entered
the
true
temple
their
own
adoring
hearts
the
temple
that
knows
not
its
builder
is
no
temple
in
it
dwells
no
divinity
but
at
length
he
comes
to
his
own
and
his
own
receive
him
comes
to
them
in
the
might
of
his
mission
to
preach
good
tidings
to
the
poor
to
heal
the
to
preach
deliverance
and
sight
and
liberty
and
the
lord
own
good
time
and
his
fellow
and
he
came
to
nazareth
where
he
had
been
brought
up
and
as
his
custom
was
he
went
into
the
synagogue
on
the
sabbath
day
and
stood
up
for
to
read
and
there
was
delivered
unto
him
the
book
of
the
prophet
esaias
and
when
he
had
opened
the
book
he
found
the
place
where
it
was
written
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
he
hath
sent
me
to
heal
the
brokenhearted
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
to
preach
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
and
he
closed
the
book
and
he
gave
it
again
to
the
minister
and
sat
down
and
the
eyes
of
all
them
that
were
in
the
synagogue
were
fastened
on
him
and
he
began
to
say
unto
them
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
iv
the
lord
sermon
upon
the
mount
seems
such
an
enlargement
of
these
words
of
the
prophet
as
might
but
for
the
refusal
of
the
men
of
nazareth
to
listen
to
him
have
followed
his
reading
of
them
here
recorded
that
as
given
by
the
evangelist
they
correspond
to
neither
of
the
differing
originals
of
the
english
and
greek
versions
ought
to
be
enough
in
itself
to
do
away
with
the
spiritually
vulgar
notion
of
the
verbal
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
the
point
at
which
the
lord
stops
in
his
reading
is
suggestive
he
closes
the
book
leaving
the
words
the
day
of
vengeance
of
our
god
or
as
in
the
septuagint
day
of
recompense
unread
vengeance
is
as
holy
a
thing
as
his
love
yea
is
love
for
god
is
love
and
god
is
not
vengeance
but
apparently
the
lord
would
not
give
the
word
a
place
in
his
announcement
of
his
mission
his
hearers
would
not
recognize
it
as
a
form
of
the
father
love
but
as
vengeance
on
their
enemies
not
vengeance
on
the
selfishness
of
those
who
would
not
be
their
brother
keeper
he
had
not
begun
with
nazareth
neither
with
galilee
prophet
has
no
honour
in
his
own
country
he
said
and
began
to
teach
where
it
was
more
likely
he
would
be
heard
it
is
true
that
he
wrought
his
first
miracle
in
cana
but
that
was
at
his
mother
request
not
of
his
own
intent
and
he
did
not
begin
his
teaching
there
he
went
first
to
jerusalem
there
cast
out
the
buyers
and
sellers
from
the
temple
and
did
other
notable
things
alluded
to
by
st
john
then
went
back
to
galilee
where
having
seen
the
things
he
did
in
jerusalem
his
former
neighbours
were
now
prepared
to
listen
to
him
of
these
the
nazarenes
to
whom
the
sight
of
him
was
more
familiar
retained
the
most
prejudice
against
him
he
belonged
to
their
very
city
they
had
known
him
from
a
child
and
low
indeed
are
they
in
whom
familiarity
with
the
high
and
true
breeds
contempt
they
are
judged
already
yet
such
was
the
fame
of
the
new
prophet
that
even
they
were
willing
to
hear
in
the
synagogue
what
he
had
to
say
to
them
thence
to
determine
for
themselves
what
claim
he
had
to
an
honourable
reception
but
the
eye
of
their
judgment
was
not
single
therefore
was
their
body
full
of
darkness
should
nazareth
indeed
prove
to
their
satisfaction
the
city
of
the
great
prophet
they
were
more
than
ready
to
grasp
at
the
renown
of
having
produced
him
he
was
indeed
the
great
prophet
and
within
a
few
minutes
they
would
have
slain
him
for
the
honour
of
israel
in
the
ignoble
even
the
love
of
their
country
partakes
largely
of
the
ignoble
there
was
a
shadow
of
the
hateless
vengeance
of
god
in
the
expulsion
of
the
dishonest
dealers
from
the
temple
with
which
the
lord
initiated
his
mission
that
was
his
first
parable
to
jerusalem
to
nazareth
he
comes
with
the
sweetest
words
of
the
prophet
of
hope
in
his
mouth
good
tidings
of
great
joy
of
healing
and
sight
and
liberty
followed
by
the
godlike
announcement
that
what
the
prophet
had
promised
he
was
come
to
fulfil
his
heart
his
eyes
his
lips
his
hands
his
whole
body
is
full
of
gifts
for
men
and
that
day
was
that
scripture
fulfilled
in
their
ears
the
prophecy
had
gone
before
that
he
should
save
his
people
from
their
sins
he
brings
an
announcement
they
will
better
understand
he
is
come
he
says
to
deliver
men
from
sorrow
and
pain
ignorance
and
oppression
everything
that
makes
life
hard
and
unfriendly
what
a
gracious
speech
what
a
daring
pledge
to
a
world
whelmed
in
tyranny
and
wrong
to
the
women
of
it
i
imagine
it
sounded
the
sweetest
in
them
woke
the
highest
hopes
they
had
scarce
had
a
hearing
when
the
lord
came
and
thereupon
things
began
to
mend
with
them
and
are
mending
still
for
the
lord
is
at
work
and
will
be
he
is
the
refuge
of
the
oppressed
by
its
very
woes
as
by
bitterest
medicine
he
is
setting
the
world
free
from
sin
and
woe
this
very
hour
he
is
curing
its
disease
the
symptoms
of
which
are
so
varied
and
so
painful
working
none
the
less
faithfully
that
the
sick
taking
the
symptoms
for
the
disease
cry
out
against
the
incompetence
of
their
physician
power
can
heal
the
they
cry
and
indeed
it
takes
a
god
to
do
it
but
the
god
is
here
in
yet
better
words
than
those
of
the
prophet
spoken
straight
from
his
own
heart
he
cries
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
he
calls
to
him
every
heart
knowing
its
own
bitterness
speaks
to
the
troubled
consciousness
of
every
child
of
the
father
he
is
come
to
free
us
from
everything
that
makes
life
less
than
bliss
essential
no
other
could
be
a
gospel
worthy
of
the
god
of
men
every
one
will
i
presume
confess
to
more
or
less
misery
its
apparent
source
may
be
this
or
that
its
real
source
is
to
use
a
poor
figure
a
dislocation
of
the
juncture
between
the
created
and
the
creating
life
this
primal
evil
is
the
parent
of
evils
unnumbered
hence
of
miseries
multitudinous
under
the
weight
of
which
the
arrogant
man
cries
out
against
life
and
goes
on
to
misuse
it
while
the
child
looks
around
for
help
and
who
shall
help
him
but
his
father
the
father
is
with
him
all
the
time
but
it
may
be
long
ere
the
child
knows
himself
in
his
arms
his
heart
may
be
long
troubled
as
well
as
his
outer
life
the
dank
mists
of
doubtful
thought
may
close
around
his
way
and
hide
from
him
the
light
of
the
world
cold
winds
from
the
desert
of
foiled
endeavour
may
sorely
buffet
and
for
a
time
baffle
his
hope
but
every
now
and
then
the
blue
pledge
of
a
great
sky
will
break
through
the
clouds
over
his
head
and
a
faint
aurora
will
walk
his
darkest
east
gradually
he
grows
more
capable
of
imagining
a
world
in
which
every
good
thing
thinkable
may
be
a
fact
best
of
all
the
story
of
him
who
is
himself
the
good
news
the
gospel
of
god
becomes
not
only
more
and
more
believable
to
his
heart
but
more
and
more
ministrant
to
his
life
of
conflict
and
his
assurance
of
a
living
father
who
hears
when
his
children
cry
the
gospel
according
to
this
or
that
expounder
of
it
may
repel
him
unspeakably
the
gospel
according
to
jesus
christ
attracts
him
supremely
and
ever
holds
where
it
has
drawn
him
to
the
priest
the
scribe
the
elder
exclaiming
against
his
in
refusing
what
they
teach
he
answers
is
life
or
death
to
me
your
gospel
i
can
not
take
to
believe
as
you
would
have
me
believe
would
be
to
lose
my
god
your
god
is
no
god
to
me
i
do
not
desire
him
i
would
rather
die
the
death
than
believe
in
such
a
god
in
the
name
of
the
true
god
i
cast
your
gospel
from
me
it
is
no
gospel
and
to
believe
it
would
be
to
wrong
him
in
whom
alone
lies
my
hope
to
believe
in
such
a
man
he
might
go
on
to
say
such
a
message
as
i
read
of
in
the
new
testament
is
life
from
the
dead
i
have
yielded
myself
to
live
no
more
in
the
idea
of
self
but
with
the
life
of
god
to
him
i
commit
the
creature
he
has
made
that
he
may
live
in
it
and
work
out
its
life
develop
it
according
to
the
idea
of
it
in
his
own
creating
mind
i
fall
in
with
his
ways
for
me
i
believe
in
him
i
trust
him
i
try
to
obey
him
i
look
to
be
rendered
capable
of
and
receive
a
pure
vision
of
his
will
freedom
from
the
of
my
limitation
from
the
bondage
of
a
finite
existence
for
the
finite
that
dwells
in
the
infinite
and
in
which
the
infinite
dwells
is
finite
no
longer
those
who
are
thus
children
indeed
are
little
gods
the
divine
brood
of
the
infinite
father
no
mere
promise
of
deliverance
from
the
consequences
of
sin
would
be
any
gospel
to
me
less
than
the
liberty
of
a
holy
heart
less
than
the
freedom
of
the
lord
himself
will
never
satisfy
one
human
soul
father
set
me
free
in
the
glory
of
thy
will
so
that
i
will
only
as
thou
willest
thy
will
be
at
once
thy
perfection
and
mine
thou
alone
art
deliverance
absolute
safety
from
every
cause
and
kind
of
trouble
that
ever
existed
anywhere
now
exists
or
ever
can
exist
in
thy
universe
but
the
people
of
the
lord
town
to
whom
he
read
appropriating
them
the
gracious
words
of
the
prophet
were
of
the
wise
and
prudent
of
their
day
with
one
and
the
same
breath
they
seem
to
cry
things
are
good
it
is
true
but
they
must
come
after
our
way
we
must
have
the
promise
to
our
fathers
fulfilled
that
we
shall
rule
the
world
the
chosen
of
god
the
children
of
abraham
and
israel
we
want
to
be
a
free
people
manage
our
own
affairs
live
in
plenty
and
do
as
we
please
liberty
alone
can
ever
cure
the
woes
of
which
you
speak
we
do
not
need
to
be
better
we
are
well
enough
give
us
riches
and
honour
and
keep
us
content
with
ourselves
that
we
may
be
satisfied
with
our
own
likeness
and
thou
shalt
be
the
messiah
never
perhaps
would
such
be
spoken
words
but
the
prevailing
condition
of
their
minds
might
often
well
take
form
in
such
speech
whereon
will
they
ground
their
complaint
should
god
give
them
their
hearts
desire
when
that
desire
given
closes
in
upon
them
with
a
torturing
sense
of
slavery
when
they
find
that
what
they
have
imagined
their
own
will
was
but
a
suggestion
they
knew
not
whence
when
they
discover
that
life
is
not
good
yet
they
can
not
die
will
they
not
then
turn
and
entreat
their
maker
to
save
them
after
his
own
fashion
let
us
try
to
understand
the
brief
elliptical
narrative
of
what
took
place
in
the
synagogue
of
nazareth
on
the
occasion
of
our
announcement
of
his
mission
day
said
jesus
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
and
went
on
with
his
divine
talk
we
shall
yet
know
i
trust
what
gracious
words
were
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth
surely
some
who
heard
them
still
remember
them
for
bare
him
witness
and
wondered
at
them
how
did
they
bear
him
witness
surely
not
alone
by
the
intensity
of
their
wondering
gaze
must
not
the
narrator
mean
that
their
hearts
bore
witness
to
the
power
of
his
presence
that
they
felt
the
appeal
of
his
soul
to
theirs
that
they
said
in
themselves
man
spake
like
this
man
must
not
the
light
of
truth
in
his
face
beheld
of
such
even
as
knew
not
the
truth
have
lifted
their
souls
up
truthward
was
it
not
the
something
true
common
to
all
hearts
that
bore
the
wondering
witness
to
the
graciousness
of
his
words
had
not
those
words
found
a
way
to
the
pure
human
that
is
the
divine
in
the
men
was
it
not
therefore
that
they
were
drawn
to
him
all
but
ready
to
accept
him
on
their
own
terms
alas
not
his
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
them
a
true
messenger
but
truth
in
him
was
not
truth
to
them
had
he
been
what
they
took
him
for
he
would
have
been
no
saviour
they
were
however
though
partly
by
mistake
well
disposed
toward
him
and
it
was
with
a
growing
sense
of
being
honoured
by
his
relation
to
them
and
the
property
they
had
in
him
that
they
said
not
this
joseph
son
but
the
lord
knew
what
was
in
their
hearts
he
knew
the
false
notion
with
which
they
were
almost
ready
to
declare
for
him
he
knew
also
the
final
proof
to
which
they
were
in
their
wisdom
and
prudence
about
to
subject
him
he
did
not
look
likely
to
be
a
prophet
seeing
he
had
grown
up
among
them
and
had
never
shown
any
credentials
they
had
a
right
to
proof
positive
they
had
heard
of
wonderful
things
he
had
done
in
other
places
why
had
they
not
first
of
all
been
done
in
sight
who
had
a
claim
equal
to
theirs
who
so
capable
as
they
to
pronounce
judgment
on
his
mission
whether
false
or
true
had
they
not
known
him
from
childhood
his
words
were
gracious
but
words
were
nothing
he
must
something
something
wonderful
without
such
conclusive
satisfying
proof
nazareth
at
least
would
never
acknowledge
him
they
were
quite
ready
for
the
honour
of
having
any
true
prophet
such
as
it
seemed
not
impossible
the
son
of
joseph
might
turn
out
to
be
recognized
as
their
one
of
their
own
people
if
he
were
such
theirs
was
the
credit
of
having
produced
him
then
indeed
they
were
ready
to
bear
witness
to
him
take
his
part
adopt
his
cause
and
before
the
world
stand
up
for
him
as
to
his
being
the
messiah
that
was
merest
absurdity
did
they
not
all
know
his
father
the
carpenter
he
might
however
be
the
prophet
whom
so
many
of
the
best
in
the
nation
were
at
the
moment
expecting
let
him
do
something
wonderful
they
were
not
a
gracious
people
or
a
good
the
lord
saw
their
thought
and
it
was
far
from
being
to
his
mind
he
desired
no
such
reception
as
they
were
at
present
equal
to
giving
a
prophet
his
mighty
works
were
not
meant
for
such
as
they
to
convince
them
of
what
they
were
incapable
of
understanding
or
welcoming
those
who
would
not
believe
without
signs
and
wonders
could
never
believe
worthily
with
any
number
of
them
and
none
should
be
given
them
his
mighty
works
were
to
rouse
the
love
and
strengthen
the
faith
of
the
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
of
such
as
were
ready
to
come
to
the
light
and
show
that
they
were
of
the
light
he
knew
how
poor
the
meaning
the
nazarenes
put
on
the
words
he
had
read
what
low
expectations
they
had
of
the
messiah
when
most
they
longed
for
his
coming
they
did
not
hear
the
prophet
while
he
read
the
prophet
at
sight
of
a
few
poor
little
wonders
nothing
to
him
to
them
sufficient
to
prove
him
such
a
messiah
as
looked
for
they
would
burst
into
loud
acclaim
and
rush
to
their
arms
eager
his
officers
and
soldiers
to
open
the
one
triumphant
campaign
against
the
accursed
romans
and
sweep
them
beyond
the
borders
of
their
sacred
country
their
messiah
would
make
of
their
nation
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
themselves
the
favourites
of
his
court
and
the
tyrants
of
the
world
salvation
from
their
sins
was
not
in
their
hearts
not
in
their
imaginations
not
at
all
in
their
thoughts
they
had
heard
him
read
his
commission
to
heal
the
they
would
rush
to
break
hearts
in
his
name
the
lord
knew
them
and
their
vain
expectations
he
would
have
no
such
followers
no
followers
on
false
conceptions
no
followers
whom
wonders
would
delight
but
nowise
better
the
nazarenes
were
not
yet
of
the
sort
that
needed
but
one
change
to
be
his
people
he
had
come
to
give
them
help
until
they
accepted
his
they
could
have
none
to
give
him
the
lord
never
did
mighty
work
in
proof
of
his
mission
to
help
a
growing
faith
in
himself
and
his
father
he
would
do
anything
he
healed
those
whom
healing
would
deeper
heal
those
in
whom
suffering
had
so
far
done
its
work
that
its
removal
also
would
carry
it
on
to
the
nazarenes
he
would
not
manifest
his
power
they
were
not
in
a
condition
to
get
good
from
such
manifestation
it
would
but
confirm
their
present
arrogance
and
ambition
wonderful
works
can
only
nourish
a
faith
already
existent
to
him
who
believes
without
it
a
miracle
be
granted
it
was
the
israelite
indeed
whom
the
lord
met
with
miracle
i
said
unto
thee
i
saw
thee
under
the
believest
thou
thou
shalt
see
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
on
the
son
of
man
those
who
laughed
him
to
scorn
were
not
allowed
to
look
on
the
resurrection
of
the
daughter
of
jairus
peter
when
he
would
walk
on
the
water
had
both
permission
and
power
given
him
to
do
so
the
widow
received
the
prophet
and
was
fed
the
syrian
went
to
the
prophet
and
was
cured
in
nazareth
because
of
unbelief
the
lord
could
only
lay
his
hands
on
a
few
sick
folk
in
the
rest
was
none
of
that
leaning
toward
the
truth
which
alone
can
make
room
for
the
help
of
a
miracle
this
they
soon
made
manifest
the
lord
saw
them
on
the
point
of
challenging
a
display
of
his
power
and
anticipated
the
challenge
with
a
refusal
for
the
better
understanding
of
his
words
let
me
presume
to
paraphrase
them
know
you
will
apply
to
me
the
proverb
physician
heal
thyself
requiring
me
to
prove
what
is
said
of
me
in
capernaum
by
doing
the
same
here
but
there
is
another
proverb
no
prophet
is
accepted
in
his
own
country
unaccepted
i
do
nothing
wonderful
in
the
great
famine
elijah
was
sent
to
no
widow
of
the
many
in
israel
but
to
a
sidonian
and
elisha
cured
no
leper
of
the
many
in
israel
but
naaman
the
syrian
there
are
those
fit
to
see
signs
and
wonders
they
are
not
always
the
kin
of
the
prophet
the
nazarenes
heard
with
indignation
their
wonder
at
his
gracious
words
was
changed
to
bitterest
wrath
the
very
beams
of
their
ugly
religion
were
exclusiveness
and
pride
in
the
fancied
favour
of
god
for
them
only
of
all
the
nations
to
hint
at
the
possibility
of
a
revelation
of
the
glory
of
god
to
a
stranger
far
more
to
hint
that
a
stranger
might
be
fitter
to
receive
such
a
revelation
than
a
jew
was
an
offence
reaching
to
the
worst
insult
and
it
was
cast
in
their
teeth
by
a
common
man
of
their
own
city
art
but
a
son
and
dost
thou
teach
darest
thou
imply
a
divine
preference
for
capernaum
over
nazareth
in
bad
odour
with
the
rest
of
their
countrymen
they
were
the
prouder
of
themselves
the
synagogue
observe
rose
in
a
fury
such
a
fellow
a
prophet
he
was
worse
than
the
worst
of
gentiles
he
was
a
false
jew
a
traitor
to
his
god
a
friend
of
the
romans
away
with
him
his
townsmen
led
the
van
in
his
rejection
by
his
own
the
men
of
nazareth
would
have
forestalled
his
crucifixion
by
them
of
jerusalem
what
a
sidonian
woman
fitter
to
receive
the
prophet
than
any
jewess
a
heathen
worthier
to
be
kept
alive
by
miracle
in
time
of
famine
than
a
worshipper
of
the
true
god
a
leper
of
damascus
less
displeasing
to
god
than
the
lepers
of
his
chosen
race
it
was
no
longer
condescending
approval
that
shone
in
their
eyes
he
a
prophet
they
had
seen
through
him
soon
had
they
found
him
out
the
moment
he
perceived
it
useless
to
pose
for
a
prophet
with
them
who
had
all
along
known
the
breed
of
him
he
had
turned
to
insult
them
he
dared
not
attempt
in
his
own
city
the
deceptions
with
which
by
the
help
of
satan
he
had
made
such
a
grand
show
and
fooled
the
idiots
of
capernaum
he
saw
they
knew
him
too
well
were
too
to
be
cozened
by
him
and
to
avoid
their
expected
challenge
fell
to
reviling
the
holy
nation
let
him
take
the
consequences
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
with
him
how
could
there
be
any
miracle
for
such
they
were
well
satisfied
with
themselves
and
nothing
almost
sees
miracles
but
misery
need
and
the
upward
look
the
mood
ready
to
believe
when
and
where
it
can
the
embryonic
faith
is
dear
to
him
whose
love
would
have
us
trust
him
let
any
man
seek
him
not
in
curious
inquiry
whether
the
story
of
him
may
be
true
or
can
not
be
true
in
humble
readiness
to
accept
him
altogether
if
only
he
can
and
he
shall
find
him
we
shall
not
fail
of
help
to
believe
because
we
doubt
but
if
the
questioner
be
such
that
the
dispersion
of
his
doubt
would
but
leave
him
in
disobedience
the
power
of
truth
has
no
care
to
effect
his
conviction
why
cast
out
a
devil
that
the
man
may
the
better
do
the
work
of
the
devil
the
childlike
doubt
will
as
it
softens
and
yields
minister
nourishment
with
all
that
was
good
in
it
to
the
at
its
heart
the
wise
and
prudent
unbelief
will
be
left
to
develop
its
own
misery
the
lord
could
easily
have
satisfied
the
nazarenes
that
he
was
the
messiah
they
would
but
have
hardened
into
the
nucleus
of
an
army
for
the
subjugation
of
the
world
to
a
warfare
with
their
own
sins
to
the
subjugation
of
their
doing
and
desiring
to
the
will
of
the
great
father
all
the
miracles
in
his
power
would
never
have
persuaded
them
a
true
convincement
is
not
possible
to
hearts
and
minds
like
theirs
not
only
is
it
impossible
for
a
low
man
to
believe
a
thousandth
part
of
what
a
noble
man
can
but
a
low
man
can
not
believe
anything
as
a
noble
man
believes
it
the
men
of
nazareth
could
have
believed
in
jesus
as
their
saviour
from
the
romans
as
their
saviour
from
their
sins
they
could
not
believe
in
him
for
they
loved
their
sins
the
king
of
heaven
came
to
offer
them
a
share
in
his
kingdom
but
they
were
not
poor
in
spirit
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
not
for
them
gladly
would
they
have
inherited
the
earth
but
they
were
not
meek
and
the
earth
was
for
the
lowly
children
of
the
perfect
father
heirs
of
heaven
and
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
taught
them
saying
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
the
words
of
the
lord
are
the
seed
sown
by
the
sower
into
our
hearts
they
must
fall
that
they
may
grow
meditation
and
prayer
must
water
them
and
obedience
keep
them
in
the
sunlight
thus
will
they
bear
fruit
for
the
lord
gathering
those
of
his
disciples
that
is
obedient
hearers
who
had
any
experience
in
trying
to
live
would
in
part
at
once
understand
them
but
as
they
obeyed
and
pondered
the
meaning
of
them
would
keep
growing
this
we
see
in
the
writings
of
the
apostles
it
will
be
so
with
us
also
who
need
to
understand
everything
he
said
neither
more
nor
less
than
they
to
whom
first
he
spoke
while
our
obligation
to
understand
is
far
greater
than
theirs
at
the
time
inasmuch
as
we
have
had
nearly
two
thousand
years
experience
of
the
continued
coming
of
the
kingdom
he
then
preached
it
is
not
yet
come
it
has
been
all
the
time
and
is
now
drawing
slowly
nearer
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
it
is
commonly
called
seems
the
first
free
utterance
in
the
presence
of
any
large
assembly
of
the
good
news
of
the
kingdom
he
had
been
teaching
his
disciples
and
messengers
and
had
already
brought
the
glad
tidings
that
his
father
was
their
father
to
many
besides
to
nathanael
for
one
to
nicodemus
to
the
woman
of
samaria
to
every
one
he
had
cured
every
one
whose
cry
for
help
he
had
heard
his
epiphany
was
a
gradual
thing
beginning
where
it
continues
with
the
individual
it
is
impossible
even
to
guess
at
what
number
may
have
heard
him
on
this
occasion
he
seems
to
have
gone
up
the
mount
because
of
the
crowd
to
secure
a
somewhat
opener
position
whence
he
could
better
speak
and
thither
followed
him
those
who
desired
to
be
taught
of
him
accompanied
doubtless
by
not
a
few
in
whom
curiosity
was
the
chief
motive
disciple
or
gazer
he
addressed
the
individuality
of
every
one
that
had
ears
to
hear
peter
and
andrew
james
and
john
are
all
we
know
as
his
recognized
disciples
followers
and
companions
at
the
time
but
while
his
words
were
addressed
to
such
as
had
come
to
him
desiring
to
learn
of
him
the
things
he
uttered
were
eternal
truths
life
in
which
was
essential
for
every
one
of
his
father
children
therefore
they
were
for
all
he
who
heard
to
obey
was
his
disciple
how
different
at
the
first
sound
of
it
must
the
good
news
have
been
from
the
news
anxiously
expected
by
those
who
waited
for
the
messiah
even
the
baptist
in
prison
lay
listening
after
something
of
quite
another
sort
the
lord
had
to
send
him
a
message
by
of
his
doings
to
remind
him
that
god
thoughts
are
not
as
our
thoughts
or
his
ways
as
our
ways
that
the
design
of
god
is
other
and
better
than
the
expectation
of
men
his
summary
of
the
gifts
he
was
giving
to
men
culminated
with
the
preaching
of
the
good
news
to
the
poor
if
john
had
known
these
his
doings
before
he
had
not
recognized
them
as
belonging
to
the
lord
special
mission
the
lord
tells
him
it
is
not
enough
to
have
accepted
him
as
the
messiah
he
must
recognize
his
doings
as
the
work
he
had
come
into
the
world
to
do
and
as
in
their
nature
so
divine
as
to
be
the
very
business
of
the
son
of
god
in
whom
the
father
was
well
pleased
wherein
then
consisted
the
goodness
of
the
news
which
he
opened
his
mouth
to
give
them
what
was
in
the
news
to
make
the
poor
glad
why
was
his
arrival
with
such
words
in
his
heart
and
mouth
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
all
good
news
from
heaven
is
of
essential
truth
involving
duty
and
giving
and
promising
help
to
the
performance
of
it
there
can
be
no
good
news
for
us
men
except
of
uplifting
love
and
no
one
can
be
lifted
up
who
will
not
rise
if
god
himself
sought
to
raise
his
little
ones
without
their
consenting
effort
they
would
drop
from
his
foiled
endeavour
he
will
carry
us
in
his
arms
till
we
are
able
to
walk
he
will
carry
us
in
his
arms
when
we
are
weary
with
walking
he
will
not
carry
us
if
we
will
not
walk
very
different
are
the
good
news
jesus
brings
us
from
certain
prevalent
representations
of
the
gospel
founded
on
the
pagan
notion
that
suffering
is
an
offset
for
sin
and
culminating
in
the
vile
assertion
that
the
suffering
of
an
innocent
man
just
because
he
is
innocent
yea
perfect
is
a
satisfaction
to
the
holy
father
for
the
evil
deeds
of
his
children
as
a
theory
concerning
the
atonement
nothing
could
be
worse
either
intellectually
morally
or
spiritually
announced
as
the
gospel
itself
as
the
good
news
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
idea
is
monstrous
as
any
chinese
dragon
such
a
gospel
is
no
gospel
however
accepted
as
god
sent
by
good
men
of
a
certain
development
it
is
evil
news
dwarfing
enslaving
maddening
news
to
the
of
the
dreariest
damnation
doubtless
some
elements
of
the
gospel
are
mixed
up
with
it
on
most
occasions
of
its
announcement
none
the
more
is
it
the
message
received
from
him
it
can
be
good
news
only
to
such
as
are
prudently
willing
to
be
delivered
from
a
god
they
fear
but
unable
to
accept
the
gospel
of
a
perfect
god
in
whom
to
trust
perfectly
the
good
news
of
jesus
was
just
the
news
of
the
thoughts
and
ways
of
the
father
in
the
midst
of
his
family
he
told
them
that
the
way
men
thought
for
themselves
and
their
children
was
not
the
way
god
thought
for
himself
and
his
children
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
founded
and
must
at
length
show
itself
founded
on
very
different
principles
from
those
of
the
kingdoms
and
families
of
the
world
meaning
by
the
world
that
part
of
the
father
family
which
will
not
be
ordered
by
him
will
not
even
try
to
obey
him
the
world
man
its
great
its
successful
its
honorable
man
is
he
who
may
have
and
do
what
he
pleases
whose
strength
lies
in
money
and
the
praise
of
men
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
the
man
who
is
humblest
and
serves
his
fellows
the
most
multitudes
of
men
in
no
degree
notable
as
ambitious
or
proud
hold
the
ambitious
the
proud
man
in
honour
and
for
all
deliverance
hope
after
some
shadow
of
his
prosperity
how
many
even
of
those
who
look
for
the
world
to
come
seek
to
the
powers
of
this
world
for
deliverance
from
its
evils
as
if
god
were
the
god
of
the
world
to
come
only
the
oppressed
of
the
lord
time
looked
for
a
messiah
to
set
their
nation
free
and
make
it
rich
and
strong
the
oppressed
of
our
time
believe
in
money
knowledge
and
the
will
of
a
people
which
needs
but
power
to
be
in
its
turn
the
oppressor
the
first
words
of
the
lord
on
this
occasion
were
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
is
not
the
proud
it
is
not
the
greedy
of
distinction
it
is
not
those
who
gather
and
hoard
not
those
who
lay
down
the
law
to
their
neighbours
not
those
that
condescend
any
more
than
those
that
shrug
the
shoulder
and
shoot
out
the
lip
that
have
any
share
in
the
kingdom
of
the
father
that
kingdom
has
no
relation
with
or
resemblance
to
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
deals
with
no
one
thing
that
distinguishes
their
rulers
except
to
repudiate
it
the
son
of
god
will
favour
no
smallest
ambition
be
it
in
the
heart
of
him
who
leans
on
his
bosom
the
kingdom
of
god
the
refuge
of
the
oppressed
the
golden
age
of
the
new
world
the
real
utopia
the
newest
yet
oldest
atlantis
the
home
of
the
children
will
not
open
its
gates
to
the
most
miserable
who
would
rise
above
his
equal
in
misery
who
looks
down
on
any
one
more
miserable
than
himself
it
is
the
home
of
perfect
brotherhood
the
poor
the
beggars
in
spirit
the
humble
men
of
heart
the
unambitious
the
unselfish
those
who
never
despise
men
and
never
seek
their
praises
the
lowly
who
see
nothing
to
admire
in
themselves
therefore
can
not
seek
to
be
admired
of
others
the
men
who
give
themselves
away
these
are
the
freemen
of
the
kingdom
these
are
the
citizens
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
men
who
are
aware
of
their
own
essential
poverty
not
the
men
who
are
poor
in
friends
poor
in
influence
poor
in
acquirements
poor
in
money
but
those
who
are
poor
in
spirit
who
themselves
poor
who
know
nothing
to
be
pleased
with
themselves
for
and
desire
nothing
to
make
them
think
well
of
themselves
who
know
that
they
need
much
to
make
their
life
worth
living
to
make
their
existence
a
good
thing
to
make
them
fit
to
live
these
humble
ones
are
the
poor
whom
the
lord
calls
blessed
when
a
man
says
i
am
low
and
worthless
then
the
gate
of
the
kingdom
begins
to
open
to
him
for
there
enter
the
true
and
this
man
has
begun
to
know
the
truth
concerning
himself
whatever
such
a
man
has
attained
to
he
straightway
forgets
it
is
part
of
him
and
behind
him
his
business
is
with
what
he
has
not
with
the
things
that
lie
above
and
before
him
the
man
who
is
proud
of
anything
he
thinks
he
has
reached
has
not
reached
it
he
is
but
proud
of
himself
and
imagining
a
cause
for
his
pride
if
he
had
reached
he
would
already
have
begun
to
forget
he
who
delights
in
contemplating
whereto
he
has
attained
is
not
merely
sliding
back
he
is
already
in
the
dirt
of
the
gate
of
the
kingdom
is
closed
and
he
outside
the
child
who
clinging
to
his
father
dares
not
think
he
has
in
any
sense
attained
while
as
yet
he
is
not
as
his
father
his
father
heart
his
father
heaven
is
his
natural
home
to
find
himself
thinking
of
himself
as
above
his
fellows
would
be
to
that
child
a
shuddering
terror
his
universe
would
contract
around
him
his
ideal
wither
on
its
throne
the
least
motion
of
the
first
thought
of
placing
himself
in
the
forefront
of
estimation
would
be
to
him
a
flash
from
the
nether
abyss
god
is
his
life
and
his
lord
that
his
father
should
be
content
with
him
must
be
all
his
care
among
his
relations
with
his
neighbour
infinitely
precious
comparison
with
his
neighbour
has
no
place
which
is
the
greater
is
of
no
account
he
would
not
choose
to
be
less
than
his
neighbour
he
would
choose
his
neighbour
to
be
greater
than
he
he
looks
up
to
every
man
otherwise
gifted
than
he
his
neighbour
is
more
than
he
all
come
from
the
one
mighty
father
shall
he
judge
the
live
thoughts
of
god
which
is
greater
and
which
is
less
in
thus
denying
thus
turning
his
back
on
himself
he
has
no
thought
of
saintliness
no
thought
but
of
his
father
and
his
brethren
to
such
a
child
best
secrets
are
open
he
clambers
about
the
throne
of
the
father
unrebuked
his
back
is
ready
for
the
smallest
heavenly
playmate
his
arms
are
an
open
refuge
for
any
blackest
little
lost
kid
of
the
flock
he
will
toil
with
it
up
the
heavenly
stair
up
the
very
steps
of
the
great
white
throne
to
lay
it
on
the
father
knees
for
the
glory
of
that
father
is
not
in
knowing
himself
god
but
in
giving
himself
away
in
creating
and
redeeming
and
glorifying
his
children
the
man
who
does
not
house
self
has
room
to
be
his
real
self
eternal
idea
of
him
he
lives
eternally
in
virtue
of
the
creative
power
present
in
him
with
momently
unimpeded
creation
he
how
should
there
be
in
him
one
thought
of
ruling
or
commanding
or
surpassing
he
can
imagine
no
bliss
no
good
in
being
greater
than
some
one
else
he
is
unable
to
wish
himself
other
than
he
is
except
more
what
god
made
him
for
which
is
indeed
the
highest
willing
of
the
will
of
god
his
brother
wellbeing
is
essential
to
his
bliss
the
thought
of
standing
higher
in
the
favour
of
god
than
his
brother
would
make
him
miserable
he
would
lift
every
brother
to
the
embrace
of
the
father
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
they
are
of
the
same
spirit
as
god
and
of
nature
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
theirs
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
expresses
the
same
principle
the
same
law
holds
in
the
earth
as
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
how
should
it
be
otherwise
has
the
creator
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
ceased
to
rule
it
after
his
fashion
because
his
rebellious
children
have
so
long
to
their
own
hurt
vainly
endeavoured
to
rule
it
after
theirs
the
kingdom
of
heaven
belongs
to
the
poor
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
the
earth
as
god
sees
it
as
those
to
whom
the
kingdom
of
heaven
belongs
also
see
it
is
good
all
good
very
good
fit
for
the
meek
to
inherit
and
one
day
they
shall
inherit
it
not
indeed
as
men
of
the
world
count
inheritance
but
as
the
maker
and
owner
of
the
world
has
from
the
first
counted
it
so
different
are
the
two
ways
of
inheriting
that
one
of
the
meek
may
be
heartily
enjoying
his
possession
while
one
of
the
proud
is
selfishly
walling
him
out
from
the
spot
in
it
he
loves
best
the
meek
are
those
that
do
not
assert
themselves
do
not
defend
themselves
never
dream
of
avenging
themselves
or
of
returning
aught
but
good
for
evil
they
do
not
imagine
it
their
business
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
meek
man
may
indeed
take
much
thought
but
it
will
not
be
for
himself
he
never
builds
an
exclusive
wall
shuts
any
honest
neighbour
out
he
will
not
always
serve
the
wish
but
always
the
good
of
his
neighbour
his
service
must
be
true
service
self
shall
be
no
umpire
in
affair
of
his
man
consciousness
of
himself
is
but
a
shadow
the
meek
man
self
always
vanishes
in
the
light
of
a
real
presence
his
nature
lies
open
to
the
father
of
men
and
to
every
good
impulse
is
as
it
were
empty
no
bristling
importance
no
vain
attendance
of
fancied
rights
and
wrongs
guards
his
door
or
crowds
the
passages
of
his
house
they
are
for
the
angels
to
come
and
go
abandoned
thus
to
the
truth
as
the
sparks
from
the
gleaming
river
dip
into
the
flowers
of
unperfected
vision
so
the
many
souls
of
the
visible
world
lights
from
the
father
of
lights
enter
his
heart
freely
and
by
them
he
inherits
the
earth
he
was
created
to
inherit
possesses
it
as
his
father
made
him
capable
of
possessing
and
the
earth
of
being
possessed
because
the
man
is
meek
his
eye
is
single
he
sees
things
as
god
sees
them
as
he
would
have
his
child
see
them
to
confront
creation
with
pure
eyes
is
to
possess
it
how
little
is
the
man
able
to
make
his
own
who
would
ravish
all
the
man
who
by
the
exclusion
of
others
from
the
space
he
calls
his
would
grasp
any
portion
of
the
earth
as
his
own
befools
himself
in
the
attempt
the
very
bread
he
has
swallowed
can
not
so
in
any
real
sense
be
his
there
does
not
exist
such
a
power
of
possessing
as
he
would
arrogate
there
is
not
such
a
sense
of
having
as
that
of
which
he
has
conceived
the
shadow
in
his
degenerate
and
lapsing
imagination
the
real
owner
of
his
demesne
is
that
pedlar
passing
his
gate
into
a
divine
soul
receiving
the
sweetnesses
which
not
all
the
greed
of
the
possessor
can
keep
within
his
walls
they
overflow
the
of
the
coping
to
give
themselves
to
the
footfarer
the
motions
aerial
the
sounds
the
odours
of
those
imprisoned
spaces
are
the
earnest
of
a
possession
for
which
is
ever
growing
his
power
of
possessing
in
no
wise
will
such
inheritance
interfere
with
the
claim
of
the
man
who
calls
them
his
each
possessor
has
them
his
as
much
as
each
in
his
own
way
is
capable
of
possessing
them
for
possession
is
determined
by
the
kind
and
the
scope
of
the
power
of
possessing
and
the
earth
has
a
fourth
dimension
of
which
the
mere
owner
of
its
soil
knows
nothing
the
child
of
the
maker
is
naturally
the
inheritor
but
if
the
child
try
to
possess
as
a
house
the
thing
his
father
made
an
organ
will
he
succeed
in
so
possessing
it
or
if
he
do
nestle
in
a
corner
of
its
case
will
he
oust
thereby
the
lord
of
its
multiplex
harmony
sitting
regnant
on
the
seat
of
sway
and
drawing
with
touch
from
the
house
of
the
child
the
liege
homage
of
its
rendered
wealth
to
the
poverty
of
such
a
child
are
all
those
left
who
think
to
have
and
to
hold
after
the
corrupt
fancies
of
a
greedy
self
we
can
not
see
the
world
as
god
means
it
save
in
proportion
as
our
souls
are
meek
in
meekness
only
are
we
its
inheritors
meekness
alone
makes
the
spiritual
retina
pure
to
receive
god
things
as
they
are
mingling
with
them
neither
imperfection
nor
impurity
of
its
own
a
thing
so
beheld
that
it
conveys
to
me
the
divine
thought
issuing
in
its
form
is
mine
by
nothing
but
its
mediation
between
god
and
my
life
can
anything
be
mine
the
man
so
dull
as
to
insist
that
a
thing
is
his
because
he
has
bought
it
and
paid
for
it
had
better
bethink
himself
that
not
all
the
combined
forces
of
law
justice
and
goodwill
can
keep
it
his
while
even
death
can
not
take
the
world
from
the
man
who
possesses
it
as
alone
the
maker
of
him
and
it
cares
that
he
should
possess
it
this
man
leaves
it
but
carries
it
with
him
that
man
carries
with
him
only
its
loss
he
passes
unable
to
close
hand
or
mouth
upon
any
portion
of
it
its
to
him
was
but
the
changes
he
could
make
in
it
and
the
nearness
into
which
he
could
bring
it
to
the
body
he
lived
in
that
body
the
earth
in
its
turn
possesses
now
and
it
lies
very
still
changing
nothing
but
being
changed
is
this
the
fine
of
the
great
buyer
of
land
to
have
his
fine
pate
full
of
fine
dirt
in
the
soul
of
the
meek
the
earth
remains
an
endless
possession
his
because
he
who
made
it
is
his
his
as
nothing
but
his
maker
could
ever
be
the
creature
he
has
the
earth
by
his
divine
relation
to
him
who
sent
it
forth
from
him
as
a
tree
sends
out
its
leaves
to
inherit
the
earth
is
to
grow
ever
more
alive
to
the
presence
in
it
and
in
all
its
parts
of
him
who
is
the
life
of
men
how
far
one
may
advance
in
such
inheritance
while
yet
in
the
body
will
simply
depend
on
the
meekness
he
attains
while
yet
in
the
body
but
it
may
be
as
frederick
denison
maurice
the
servant
of
god
thought
while
yet
he
was
with
us
that
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
are
the
same
in
which
we
now
live
righteously
inhabited
by
the
meek
with
their
eyes
what
if
the
meek
of
the
dead
be
thus
possessing
it
even
now
but
i
do
not
care
to
speculate
it
is
enough
that
the
man
who
refuses
to
assert
himself
seeking
no
recognition
by
men
leaving
the
care
of
his
life
to
the
father
and
occupying
himself
with
the
will
of
the
father
shall
find
himself
by
and
by
at
home
in
the
father
house
with
all
the
father
property
his
which
is
more
the
possessor
of
the
world
he
who
has
a
thousand
houses
or
he
who
without
one
house
to
call
his
own
has
ten
in
which
his
knock
at
the
door
would
rouse
instant
jubilation
which
is
the
richer
the
man
who
his
large
money
spent
would
have
no
refuge
or
he
for
whose
necessity
a
hundred
would
sacrifice
comfort
which
of
the
two
possessed
the
earth
king
agrippa
or
paul
which
is
the
real
possessor
of
a
book
the
man
who
has
its
original
and
every
following
edition
and
shows
to
many
an
admiring
and
envying
visitor
now
this
now
that
in
binding
characteristic
with
yea
from
secret
shrine
is
able
to
draw
forth
and
display
the
author
manuscript
with
the
very
shapes
in
which
his
thoughts
came
forth
to
the
light
of
day
or
the
man
who
cherishes
one
little
coverless
untitled
bethumbed
copy
which
he
takes
with
him
in
his
solitary
walks
and
broods
over
in
his
silent
chamber
always
finding
in
it
some
beauty
or
excellence
or
aid
he
had
not
found
before
which
is
to
him
in
truth
as
a
live
companion
for
what
makes
the
thing
a
book
is
it
not
that
it
has
a
soul
the
mind
in
it
of
him
who
wrote
the
book
therefore
only
can
the
book
be
possessed
for
life
alone
can
be
the
possession
of
life
the
dead
possess
their
dead
only
to
bury
them
does
not
he
then
who
loves
and
understands
his
book
possess
it
with
such
possession
as
is
impossible
to
the
other
just
so
may
the
world
itself
be
possessed
either
as
a
volume
unread
or
as
the
wine
of
a
soul
precious
of
a
embalmed
and
treasured
up
on
purpose
to
a
life
beyond
life
it
may
be
possessed
as
a
book
filled
with
words
from
the
mouth
of
god
or
but
as
the
covers
of
that
book
as
an
embodiment
or
incarnation
of
god
himself
or
but
as
a
house
built
to
sell
the
lord
loved
the
world
and
the
things
of
the
world
not
as
the
men
of
the
world
love
them
but
finding
his
father
in
everything
that
came
from
his
father
heart
the
same
spirit
then
is
required
for
possessing
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
for
inheriting
the
earth
how
should
it
not
be
so
when
the
one
power
is
the
informing
life
of
both
if
we
are
the
lord
we
possess
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
so
inherit
the
earth
how
many
who
call
themselves
by
his
name
would
have
it
otherwise
they
would
possess
the
earth
and
inherit
the
kingdom
such
fill
churches
and
chapels
on
sundays
anywhere
suits
for
the
worship
of
mammon
yet
verily
earth
as
well
as
heaven
may
be
largely
possessed
even
now
two
men
are
walking
abroad
together
to
the
one
the
world
yields
thought
after
thought
of
delight
he
sees
heaven
and
earth
embrace
one
another
he
feels
an
indescribable
presence
over
and
in
them
his
joy
will
afterward
in
the
solitude
of
his
chamber
break
forth
in
song
to
the
other
oppressed
with
the
thought
of
his
poverty
or
ruminating
how
to
make
much
into
more
the
glory
of
the
lord
is
but
a
warm
summer
day
it
enters
in
at
no
window
of
his
soul
it
offers
him
no
gift
for
in
the
very
temple
of
god
he
looks
for
no
god
in
it
nor
must
there
needs
be
two
men
to
think
and
feel
thus
differently
in
what
diverse
fashion
will
any
one
to
mood
see
the
same
world
of
the
same
glad
creator
alas
for
men
if
it
changed
as
we
change
if
it
grew
meaningless
when
we
grow
faithless
thought
for
a
morrow
that
may
never
come
dread
of
the
dividing
death
which
works
for
endless
companionship
anger
with
one
we
love
will
cloud
the
radiant
morning
and
make
the
day
dark
with
night
at
evening
having
bethought
ourselves
and
returned
to
him
that
feeds
the
ravens
and
watches
the
dying
sparrow
and
says
to
his
children
one
another
the
sunset
splendour
is
glad
over
us
the
western
sky
is
refulgent
as
the
court
of
the
father
when
the
glad
news
is
spread
abroad
that
a
sinner
has
repented
we
have
mourned
in
the
twilight
of
our
little
faith
but
having
sent
away
our
sin
the
glory
of
god
heaven
over
his
darkening
earth
has
comforted
us
the
pledge
of
are
they
that
mourn
for
they
shall
be
comforted
grief
then
sorrow
pain
of
heart
mourning
is
no
between
man
and
god
so
far
is
it
from
opposing
any
obstacle
to
the
passage
of
god
light
into
man
soul
that
the
lord
congratulates
them
that
mourn
there
is
no
evil
in
sorrow
true
it
is
not
an
essential
good
a
good
in
itself
like
love
but
it
will
mingle
with
any
good
thing
and
is
even
so
allied
to
good
that
it
will
open
the
door
of
the
heart
for
any
good
more
of
sorrowful
than
of
joyful
men
are
always
standing
about
the
everlasting
doors
that
open
into
the
presence
of
the
most
high
it
is
true
also
that
joy
is
in
its
nature
more
divine
than
sorrow
for
although
man
must
sorrow
and
god
share
in
his
sorrow
yet
in
himself
god
is
not
sorrowful
and
the
creator
never
made
man
for
sorrow
it
is
but
a
stormy
strait
through
which
he
must
pass
to
his
ocean
of
peace
he
the
joy
the
last
in
every
song
still
i
repeat
a
man
in
sorrow
is
in
general
far
nearer
god
than
a
man
in
joy
gladness
may
make
a
man
forget
his
thanksgiving
misery
drives
him
to
his
prayers
for
we
not
yet
we
are
only
the
endless
day
will
at
length
dawn
whose
every
throbbing
moment
will
heave
our
hearts
godward
we
shall
scarce
need
to
lift
them
up
now
there
are
two
to
the
house
of
prayer
and
sorrow
is
more
on
the
alert
to
open
than
her
grandson
joy
the
gladsome
child
runs
farther
afield
the
wounded
child
turns
to
go
home
the
weeper
sits
down
close
to
the
gate
the
lord
of
life
draws
nigh
to
him
from
within
god
loves
not
sorrow
yet
rejoices
to
see
a
man
sorrowful
for
in
his
sorrow
man
leaves
his
heavenward
door
on
the
latch
and
god
can
enter
to
help
him
he
loves
i
say
to
see
him
sorrowful
for
then
he
can
come
near
to
part
him
from
that
which
makes
his
sorrow
a
welcome
sight
when
ephraim
bemoans
himself
he
is
a
pleasant
child
so
good
a
medicine
is
sorrow
so
powerful
to
slay
the
moths
that
infest
and
devour
the
human
heart
that
the
lord
is
glad
to
see
a
man
weep
he
congratulates
him
on
his
sadness
grief
is
an
thing
but
she
is
love
own
child
and
her
mother
loves
her
the
promise
to
them
that
mourn
is
not
kingdom
of
but
that
their
mourning
shall
be
ended
that
they
shall
be
comforted
to
mourn
is
not
to
fight
with
evil
it
is
only
to
miss
that
which
is
good
it
is
not
an
essential
heavenly
condition
like
poorness
of
spirit
or
meekness
no
man
will
carry
his
mourning
with
him
into
heaven
or
if
he
does
it
will
speedily
be
turned
either
into
joy
or
into
what
will
result
in
joy
namely
redemptive
action
mourning
is
a
blossom
on
the
of
love
is
there
any
mourning
worthy
the
name
that
has
not
love
for
its
root
men
mourn
because
they
love
love
is
the
life
out
of
which
are
fashioned
all
the
natural
feelings
every
emotion
of
man
love
modelled
by
faith
is
hope
love
shaped
by
wrong
is
anger
verily
anger
though
pure
of
sin
love
invaded
by
loss
is
grief
the
garment
of
mourning
is
oftenest
a
the
loss
of
the
loved
by
death
is
the
main
cause
of
the
mourning
of
the
world
the
greek
word
here
used
to
describe
the
blessed
of
the
lord
generally
means
that
mourn
for
the
it
is
not
in
the
new
testament
employed
exclusively
in
this
sense
neither
do
i
imagine
it
stands
here
for
such
only
there
are
griefs
than
death
sorer
far
and
harder
far
to
comfort
harder
even
for
god
himself
with
whom
all
things
are
possible
but
it
may
give
pleasure
to
know
that
the
promise
of
comfort
to
those
that
mourn
may
specially
apply
to
those
that
mourn
because
their
loved
have
gone
out
of
their
sight
and
beyond
the
reach
of
their
cry
their
sorrow
indeed
to
the
love
divine
involves
no
difficulty
it
is
a
small
matter
easily
met
the
father
whose
elder
son
is
ever
with
him
but
whose
younger
is
in
a
far
country
wasting
his
substance
with
riotous
living
is
unspeakably
more
to
be
pitied
and
is
harder
to
help
than
that
father
both
of
whose
sons
lie
in
the
sleep
of
death
much
of
what
goes
by
the
name
of
comfort
is
merely
worthless
and
such
as
could
be
comforted
by
it
i
should
not
care
to
comfort
let
time
do
what
it
may
to
bring
the
ease
of
oblivion
let
change
of
scene
do
what
in
it
lies
to
lead
thought
away
from
the
vanished
let
new
loves
bury
grief
in
the
grave
of
the
old
love
consolation
of
such
sort
could
never
have
crossed
the
mind
of
jesus
would
the
truth
call
a
man
blessed
because
his
pain
would
sooner
or
later
depart
leaving
him
at
best
no
better
than
before
and
certainly
poorer
not
only
the
beloved
gone
but
the
sorrow
for
him
too
and
with
the
sorrow
the
love
that
had
caused
the
sorrow
blessed
of
god
because
restored
to
an
absence
of
sorrow
such
a
god
were
fitly
adored
only
where
not
one
heart
worshipped
in
spirit
and
in
truth
lord
means
of
course
some
one
may
say
the
comfort
of
the
mourners
will
be
the
restoration
of
that
which
they
have
lost
he
means
blessed
are
ye
although
ye
mourn
for
your
sorrow
will
be
turned
into
joy
happy
are
they
whom
nothing
less
than
such
restoration
will
comfort
but
would
such
restoration
be
comfort
enough
for
the
heart
of
jesus
to
give
was
ever
love
so
deep
so
pure
so
perfect
as
to
be
good
enough
for
him
and
suppose
the
love
between
the
parted
two
had
been
such
would
the
mere
restoration
in
the
future
of
that
which
once
he
had
be
ground
enough
for
so
emphatically
proclaiming
the
man
blessed
now
blessed
while
yet
in
the
midnight
of
his
loss
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
hour
of
his
deliverance
to
call
a
man
in
his
sorrow
because
of
something
to
be
given
him
surely
implies
a
something
better
than
what
he
had
before
true
the
joy
that
is
past
may
have
been
so
great
that
the
man
might
well
feel
blessed
in
the
merest
hope
of
its
restoration
but
would
that
be
meaning
enough
for
the
word
in
the
mouth
of
the
lord
that
the
interruption
of
his
blessedness
was
but
temporary
would
hardly
be
fit
ground
for
calling
the
man
in
that
interruption
is
a
strong
word
and
in
the
mouth
of
jesus
means
all
it
can
mean
can
his
saying
here
mean
less
than
are
they
that
mourn
for
they
shall
be
comforted
with
a
bliss
well
worth
all
the
pain
of
the
medicinal
sorrow
besides
the
benediction
surely
means
that
the
man
is
blessed
of
his
condition
of
mourning
not
in
spite
of
it
his
mourning
is
surely
a
part
at
least
of
the
lord
ground
for
congratulating
him
is
it
not
the
present
operative
means
whereby
the
consolation
is
growing
possible
in
a
word
i
do
not
think
the
lord
would
be
content
to
call
a
man
blessed
on
the
mere
ground
of
his
going
to
be
restored
to
a
former
bliss
by
no
means
perfect
i
think
he
congratulated
the
mourners
upon
the
grief
they
were
enduring
because
he
saw
the
excellent
glory
of
the
comfort
that
was
drawing
nigh
because
he
knew
the
immeasurably
greater
joy
to
which
the
sorrow
was
at
once
clearing
the
way
and
conducting
the
mourner
when
i
say
god
forbid
i
should
mean
i
mean
the
same
bliss
divinely
enlarged
and
divinely
purified
passed
again
through
the
hands
of
the
creative
perfection
the
lord
knew
all
the
history
of
love
and
loss
beheld
throughout
the
universe
the
winged
love
discrowning
the
skeleton
fear
god
comfort
must
ever
be
larger
than
man
grief
else
were
there
gaps
in
his
godhood
mere
restoration
would
leave
a
hiatus
barren
and
growthless
in
the
development
of
his
children
but
alas
what
a
pinched
hope
what
miserable
expectations
most
who
call
themselves
the
lord
disciples
derive
from
their
notions
of
his
teaching
well
may
they
think
of
death
as
the
one
thing
to
be
right
zealously
avoided
and
for
ever
lamented
who
would
forsake
even
the
hut
of
his
sorrow
for
the
poor
mean
place
they
imagine
the
father
house
why
many
of
them
do
not
even
expect
to
know
their
friends
there
do
not
expect
to
distinguish
one
from
another
of
all
the
holy
assembly
they
will
look
in
many
faces
but
never
to
recognize
old
friends
and
lovers
a
fine
saviour
of
men
is
their
jesus
glorious
lights
they
shine
in
the
world
of
our
sorrow
holding
forth
a
word
of
darkness
of
dismallest
death
is
the
lord
such
as
they
believe
him
then
good
master
cries
the
human
heart
thought
thou
couldst
save
me
but
alas
thou
canst
not
if
thou
savest
the
part
of
our
being
which
can
sin
thou
lettest
the
part
that
can
love
sink
into
hopeless
perdition
thou
art
not
he
that
should
come
i
look
for
another
thou
wouldst
destroy
and
not
save
me
thy
father
is
not
my
father
thy
god
is
not
my
god
ah
to
whom
shall
we
go
he
has
not
the
words
of
eternal
life
this
jesus
and
the
universe
is
dark
as
chaos
o
father
this
thy
son
is
good
but
we
need
a
greater
son
than
he
never
will
thy
children
love
thee
under
the
shadow
of
this
new
law
that
they
are
not
to
love
one
another
as
thou
lovest
them
how
does
that
man
love
god
of
what
kind
is
the
love
he
bears
him
who
is
unable
to
believe
that
god
loves
every
throb
of
every
human
heart
toward
another
did
not
the
lord
die
that
we
should
love
one
another
and
be
one
with
him
and
the
father
and
is
not
the
knowledge
of
difference
essential
to
the
deepest
love
can
there
be
oneness
without
difference
harmony
without
distinction
are
all
to
have
the
same
face
then
why
faces
at
all
if
the
plains
of
heaven
are
to
be
crowded
with
the
same
one
face
over
and
over
for
ever
but
one
moment
will
pass
ere
by
monotony
bliss
shall
have
grown
ghastly
why
not
perfect
spheres
of
featureless
ivory
rather
than
those
multitudinous
heads
with
one
face
or
are
we
to
start
afresh
with
countenances
all
new
each
beautiful
each
lovable
each
a
revelation
of
the
infinite
father
each
distinct
from
every
other
and
therefore
all
blending
toward
a
full
revealing
but
never
more
the
dear
old
precious
faces
with
its
whole
story
in
each
which
seem
at
the
very
thought
of
them
to
draw
our
hearts
out
of
our
bosoms
were
they
created
only
to
become
dear
and
be
destroyed
is
it
in
wine
only
that
the
old
is
better
would
such
a
new
heaven
be
a
thing
to
thank
god
for
would
this
be
a
prospect
on
which
the
son
of
man
would
congratulate
the
mourner
or
at
which
the
mourner
for
the
dead
would
count
himself
blessed
it
is
a
shame
that
such
a
preposterous
monstrous
unbelief
should
call
for
argument
a
heaven
without
human
love
it
were
inhuman
and
yet
more
undivine
to
desire
it
ought
not
to
be
desired
by
any
being
made
in
the
image
of
god
the
lord
of
life
died
that
his
father
children
might
grow
perfect
in
love
might
love
their
brothers
and
sisters
as
he
loved
them
is
it
to
this
end
that
they
must
cease
to
know
one
another
to
annihilate
the
past
of
our
earthly
embodiment
would
be
to
crush
under
the
heel
of
an
iron
fate
the
very
idea
of
tenderness
human
or
divine
we
shall
all
doubtless
be
changed
but
in
what
direction
to
something
less
or
to
something
greater
to
something
that
is
less
we
which
means
degradation
to
something
that
is
not
we
which
means
annihilation
or
to
something
that
is
more
we
which
means
a
farther
development
of
the
original
idea
of
us
the
divine
germ
of
us
holding
in
it
all
we
ever
were
all
we
ever
can
and
must
become
what
is
it
constitutes
this
or
that
man
is
it
what
he
himself
thinks
he
is
assuredly
not
is
it
what
his
friends
at
any
given
moment
think
him
far
from
it
in
which
of
his
changing
moods
is
he
more
himself
loves
any
lover
so
little
as
to
desire
change
in
the
person
loved
no
something
different
to
bring
him
or
her
closer
to
the
indwelling
ideal
in
the
loveliest
is
there
not
something
not
like
her
something
less
lovely
than
she
some
little
thing
in
which
a
change
would
make
her
not
less
but
more
herself
is
it
not
of
the
very
essence
of
the
christian
hope
that
we
shall
be
changed
from
much
bad
to
all
good
if
a
wife
so
love
that
she
would
keep
every
opposition
every
inconsistency
in
her
husband
as
yet
but
partially
harmonious
character
she
does
not
love
well
enough
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
if
its
imperfections
be
essential
to
the
individuality
she
loves
and
to
the
repossession
of
her
joy
in
it
she
may
be
sure
that
if
he
were
restored
to
her
as
she
would
have
him
she
would
soon
come
to
love
him
less
perhaps
to
love
him
not
at
all
for
no
one
who
does
not
love
perfection
will
ever
keep
constant
in
loving
fault
is
not
lovable
it
is
only
the
good
in
which
the
alien
fault
dwells
that
causes
it
to
seem
capable
of
being
loved
neither
is
it
any
man
peculiarities
that
make
him
beloved
it
is
the
essential
humanity
underlying
those
peculiarities
they
may
make
him
interesting
and
where
not
offensive
they
may
come
to
be
loved
for
the
sake
of
the
man
but
in
themselves
they
are
of
smallest
account
we
must
not
however
confound
peculiarity
with
diversity
diversity
is
in
and
from
god
peculiarity
in
and
from
man
the
real
man
is
the
divine
idea
of
him
the
man
god
had
in
view
when
he
began
to
send
him
forth
out
of
thought
into
thinking
the
man
he
is
now
working
to
perfect
by
casting
out
what
is
not
he
and
developing
what
is
he
but
in
god
real
men
that
is
his
ideal
men
the
diversity
is
infinite
he
does
not
repeat
his
creations
every
one
of
his
children
differs
from
every
other
and
in
every
one
the
diversity
is
lovable
god
gives
in
his
children
an
analysis
of
himself
an
analysis
that
will
never
be
exhausted
it
is
the
original
of
the
individual
man
that
will
at
length
be
given
without
spot
or
blemish
into
the
arms
of
love
such
surely
is
the
heart
of
the
comfort
the
lord
will
give
those
whose
love
is
now
making
them
mourn
and
their
present
blessedness
must
be
the
expectation
of
the
time
when
the
true
lover
shall
find
the
restored
the
same
as
the
lost
with
precious
differences
the
things
that
were
not
like
the
true
self
gone
or
going
the
things
that
were
loveliest
lovelier
still
the
restored
not
merely
more
than
the
lost
but
more
the
person
lost
than
he
or
she
that
was
lost
for
the
things
which
made
him
or
her
what
he
or
she
was
the
things
that
rendered
lovable
the
things
essential
to
the
person
will
be
more
present
because
more
developed
whether
or
not
the
lord
was
here
thinking
specially
of
the
mourners
for
the
dead
as
i
think
he
was
he
surely
does
not
limit
the
word
of
comfort
to
them
or
wish
us
to
believe
less
than
that
his
father
has
perfect
comfort
for
every
human
grief
out
upon
such
miserable
theologians
as
instead
of
receiving
them
into
the
good
soil
of
a
generous
heart
to
bring
forth
truth
an
hundred
fold
so
cut
and
pare
the
words
of
the
lord
as
to
take
the
very
life
from
them
quenching
all
their
glory
and
colour
in
their
own
inability
to
believe
and
still
would
have
the
dead
letter
of
them
accepted
as
the
comfort
of
a
creator
to
the
sore
hearts
he
made
in
his
own
image
here
if
they
were
god
spies
some
such
would
tell
us
that
the
lord
proclaims
the
blessedness
of
those
that
mourn
for
their
sins
and
of
them
only
what
mere
honest
man
would
make
a
promise
which
was
all
a
reservation
except
in
one
unmentioned
point
assuredly
they
who
mourn
for
their
sins
will
be
gloriously
comforted
but
certainly
such
also
as
are
bowed
down
with
any
grief
the
lord
would
have
us
know
that
sorrow
is
not
a
part
of
life
that
it
is
but
a
wind
blowing
throughout
it
to
winnow
and
cleanse
where
shall
the
woman
go
whose
child
is
at
the
point
of
death
or
whom
the
husband
of
her
youth
has
forsaken
but
to
her
father
in
heaven
must
she
keep
away
until
she
knows
herself
sorry
for
her
sins
how
should
that
woman
care
to
be
delivered
from
her
sins
how
could
she
accept
any
comfort
who
believed
the
child
of
her
bosom
lost
to
her
for
ever
would
the
lord
have
such
a
one
be
of
good
cheer
of
merry
heart
because
her
sins
were
forgiven
her
would
such
a
mother
be
a
woman
of
whom
the
saviour
of
men
might
have
been
born
if
a
woman
forget
the
child
she
has
borne
and
nourished
how
shall
she
remember
the
father
from
whom
she
has
herself
come
the
lord
came
to
heal
the
therefore
he
said
are
the
mourners
hope
in
god
mother
for
the
deadest
of
thy
children
even
for
him
who
died
in
his
sins
thou
mayest
have
long
to
wait
for
him
but
he
will
be
found
it
may
be
thou
thyself
wilt
one
day
be
sent
to
seek
him
and
find
him
rest
thy
hope
on
no
excuse
thy
love
would
make
for
him
neither
upon
any
quibble
theological
or
sacerdotal
hope
on
in
him
who
created
him
and
who
loves
him
more
than
thou
god
will
excuse
him
better
than
thou
and
his
uncovenanted
mercy
is
larger
than
that
of
his
ministers
shall
not
father
do
best
to
find
his
prodigal
the
good
shepherd
to
find
his
lost
sheep
the
angels
in
his
presence
know
the
father
and
watch
for
the
prodigal
thou
shalt
be
comforted
there
is
one
phase
of
our
mourning
for
the
dead
which
i
must
not
leave
unconsidered
seeing
it
is
the
pain
within
pain
of
all
our
mourning
the
sorrow
namely
with
its
keen
recurrent
pangs
because
of
things
we
have
said
or
done
or
omitted
to
say
or
do
while
we
companied
with
the
departed
the
very
life
that
would
give
itself
to
the
other
aches
with
the
sense
of
having
this
time
and
that
not
given
what
it
might
we
cast
ourselves
at
their
feet
crying
forgive
me
my
heart
own
but
they
are
pale
with
distance
and
do
not
seem
to
hear
it
may
be
that
they
are
longing
in
like
agony
of
love
after
us
but
know
better
or
perhaps
only
are
more
assured
than
we
that
we
shall
be
comforted
together
by
and
by
bethink
thee
brother
sister
i
say
bethink
thee
of
the
splendour
of
god
and
answer
would
he
be
perfect
if
in
his
restitution
of
all
things
there
were
no
opportunity
for
declaring
our
bitter
grief
and
shame
for
the
past
no
moment
in
which
to
sob
sister
brother
i
am
thy
slave
no
room
for
making
amends
at
the
same
time
when
the
desired
moment
comes
one
look
in
the
eyes
may
be
enough
and
we
shall
know
one
another
even
as
god
knows
us
like
the
purposed
words
of
the
prodigal
in
the
parable
it
may
be
that
the
words
of
our
confession
will
hardly
find
place
heart
may
so
speak
to
heart
as
to
forget
there
were
such
things
mourner
hope
in
god
and
comfort
where
thou
canst
and
the
lord
of
mourners
will
be
able
to
comfort
thee
the
sooner
it
may
be
thy
very
severity
with
thyself
has
already
moved
the
lord
to
take
thy
part
such
as
mourn
the
loss
of
love
such
from
whom
the
friend
the
brother
the
lover
has
turned
away
what
shall
i
cry
to
them
you
too
shall
be
comforted
only
hearken
whatever
selfishness
clouds
the
love
that
mourns
the
loss
of
love
that
selfishness
must
be
taken
out
of
it
burned
out
of
it
even
by
pain
extreme
if
such
be
needful
by
cause
of
that
in
thy
love
which
was
not
love
it
may
be
thy
loss
has
come
anyhow
because
of
thy
love
defect
thou
must
suffer
that
it
may
be
supplied
god
will
not
like
the
unjust
judge
avenge
thee
to
escape
the
cry
that
troubles
him
no
crying
will
make
him
comfort
thy
selfishness
he
will
not
render
thee
incapable
of
loving
truly
he
despises
neither
thy
love
though
mingled
with
selfishness
nor
thy
suffering
that
springs
from
both
he
will
disentangle
thy
selfishness
from
thy
love
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
his
cure
for
thy
selfishness
at
once
and
thy
suffering
is
to
make
thee
love
more
and
more
truly
not
with
the
love
of
love
but
with
the
love
of
the
person
whose
lost
love
thou
bemoanest
for
the
love
of
love
is
the
love
of
thyself
begin
to
love
as
god
loves
and
thy
grief
will
assuage
but
for
comfort
wait
his
time
what
he
will
do
for
thee
he
only
knows
it
may
be
thou
wilt
never
know
what
he
will
do
but
only
what
he
has
done
it
was
too
good
for
thee
to
know
save
by
receiving
it
the
moment
thou
art
capable
of
it
thine
it
will
be
one
thing
is
clear
in
regard
to
every
trouble
that
the
natural
way
with
it
is
straight
to
the
father
knee
the
father
is
father
his
children
else
why
did
he
make
himself
their
father
wouldst
thou
not
mourner
be
comforted
rather
after
the
one
eternal
fashion
the
child
by
the
father
than
in
such
poor
temporary
way
as
would
but
leave
thee
the
more
exposed
to
thy
worst
enemy
thine
own
unreclaimed
self
an
enemy
who
has
but
this
one
good
thing
in
him
that
he
will
always
bring
thee
to
sorrow
the
lord
has
come
to
wipe
away
our
tears
he
is
doing
it
he
will
have
it
done
as
soon
as
he
can
and
until
he
can
he
would
have
them
flow
without
bitterness
to
which
end
he
tells
us
it
is
a
blessed
thing
to
mourn
because
of
the
comfort
on
its
way
accept
his
comfort
now
and
so
prepare
for
the
comfort
at
hand
he
is
getting
you
ready
for
it
but
you
must
be
a
fellow
worker
with
him
or
he
will
never
have
done
he
have
you
pure
in
heart
eager
after
righteousness
a
very
child
of
his
father
in
heaven
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
are
they
which
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
for
they
shall
be
filled
are
the
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
the
cry
of
the
deepest
in
man
has
always
been
to
see
god
it
was
the
cry
of
moses
and
the
cry
of
job
the
cry
of
psalmist
and
of
prophet
and
to
the
cry
there
has
ever
been
faintly
heard
a
far
approach
of
coming
answer
in
the
fullness
of
time
the
son
appears
with
the
proclamation
that
a
certain
class
of
men
shall
behold
the
father
are
the
pure
in
heart
he
cries
they
shall
see
god
he
who
saw
god
who
sees
him
now
who
always
did
and
always
will
see
him
says
pure
and
you
also
shall
see
him
to
see
god
was
the
lord
own
eternal
one
happiness
therefore
he
knew
that
the
essential
bliss
of
the
creature
is
to
behold
the
face
of
the
creator
in
that
face
lies
the
mystery
of
a
man
own
nature
the
history
of
a
man
own
being
he
who
can
read
no
line
of
it
can
know
neither
himself
nor
his
fellow
he
only
who
knows
god
a
little
can
at
all
understand
man
the
blessed
in
dante
paradise
ever
and
always
read
each
other
thoughts
in
god
looking
to
him
they
find
their
neighbour
all
that
the
creature
needs
to
see
or
know
all
that
the
creature
can
see
or
know
is
the
face
of
him
from
whom
he
came
not
seeing
and
knowing
it
he
will
never
be
at
rest
seeing
and
knowing
it
his
existence
will
yet
indeed
be
a
mystery
to
him
and
an
awe
but
no
more
a
dismay
to
know
that
it
is
and
that
it
has
power
neither
to
continue
nor
to
cease
must
to
any
soul
alive
enough
to
appreciate
the
fact
be
merest
terror
save
also
it
knows
one
with
it
the
power
by
which
it
exists
from
the
man
who
comes
to
know
and
feel
that
power
in
him
and
one
with
him
loneliness
anxiety
and
fear
vanish
he
is
no
more
an
orphan
without
a
home
a
little
one
astray
on
the
cold
waste
of
a
helpless
consciousness
he
cries
me
fast
to
thy
creating
will
that
i
may
know
myself
one
with
it
know
myself
its
outcome
its
willed
embodiment
and
rejoice
without
trembling
be
this
the
delight
of
my
being
that
thou
hast
willed
hast
loved
me
forth
let
me
know
that
i
am
thy
child
born
to
obey
thee
dost
thou
not
justify
thy
deed
to
thyself
by
thy
tenderness
toward
me
dost
thou
not
justify
it
to
thy
child
by
revealing
to
him
his
claim
on
thee
because
of
thy
disparture
of
him
from
thyself
because
of
his
utter
dependence
on
thee
father
thou
art
in
me
else
i
could
not
be
in
thee
could
have
no
house
for
my
soul
to
dwell
in
or
any
world
in
which
to
walk
abroad
these
truths
are
i
believe
the
very
necessities
of
fact
but
a
man
does
not
therefore
at
a
given
moment
necessarily
know
them
it
is
absolutely
necessary
none
the
less
to
his
real
being
that
he
should
know
these
spiritual
relations
in
which
he
stands
to
his
origin
yea
that
they
should
be
always
present
and
potent
with
him
and
become
the
heart
and
sphere
and
substance
of
his
consciousness
of
which
they
are
the
ground
and
foundation
once
to
have
seen
them
is
not
always
to
see
them
there
are
times
and
those
times
many
when
the
cares
of
this
world
with
no
right
to
any
part
in
our
thought
seeing
either
they
are
unreasonable
or
god
imperfect
so
blind
the
eyes
of
the
soul
to
the
radiance
of
the
eternally
true
that
they
see
it
only
as
if
it
ought
to
be
true
not
as
if
it
must
be
true
as
if
it
might
be
true
in
the
region
of
thought
but
could
not
be
true
in
the
region
of
fact
our
very
senses
filled
with
the
things
of
our
passing
sojourn
combine
to
cast
discredit
upon
the
existence
of
any
world
for
the
sake
of
which
we
are
furnished
with
an
inner
eye
an
eternal
ear
but
had
we
once
seen
god
face
to
face
should
we
not
be
always
and
for
ever
sure
of
him
we
have
had
but
glimpses
of
the
father
yet
if
we
had
seen
god
face
to
face
but
had
again
become
impure
of
heart
if
such
a
fearful
thought
be
a
possible
idea
we
should
then
no
more
believe
that
we
had
ever
beheld
him
a
soul
could
never
recall
the
vision
whose
essential
verity
was
its
only
possible
proof
none
but
the
pure
in
heart
see
god
only
the
hope
to
see
him
even
those
who
saw
the
lord
the
express
image
of
his
person
did
not
see
god
they
only
saw
jesus
and
then
but
the
outside
jesus
or
a
little
more
they
were
not
pure
in
heart
they
saw
him
and
did
not
see
him
they
saw
him
with
their
eyes
but
not
with
those
eyes
which
alone
can
see
god
those
were
not
born
in
them
yet
neither
the
eyes
of
the
nor
the
eyes
of
unembodied
spirits
can
see
god
only
the
eyes
of
that
eternal
something
that
is
of
the
very
essence
of
god
the
the
the
can
see
him
it
is
not
because
we
are
created
and
he
uncreated
it
is
not
because
of
any
difference
involved
in
that
difference
of
all
differences
that
we
can
not
see
him
if
he
pleased
to
take
a
shape
and
that
shape
were
presented
to
us
and
we
saw
that
shape
we
should
not
therefore
be
seeing
god
even
if
we
knew
it
was
a
shape
of
god
call
it
even
god
himself
our
eyes
rested
upon
if
we
had
been
told
the
fact
and
believed
the
report
yet
if
we
did
not
see
the
were
not
capable
of
recognizing
him
so
as
without
the
report
to
know
the
vision
him
we
should
not
be
seeing
god
we
should
only
be
seeing
the
tabernacle
in
which
for
the
moment
he
dwelt
in
other
words
not
seeing
what
in
the
form
made
it
a
form
fit
for
him
to
take
we
should
not
be
seeing
a
presence
which
could
only
be
god
to
see
god
is
to
stand
on
the
highest
point
of
created
being
not
until
we
see
god
no
partial
and
passing
embodiment
of
him
but
the
abiding
presence
do
we
stand
upon
our
own
the
height
of
the
existence
god
has
given
us
and
up
to
which
he
is
leading
us
that
there
we
should
stand
is
the
end
of
our
creation
this
truth
is
at
the
heart
of
everything
means
all
kinds
of
completions
may
be
uttered
in
many
ways
but
language
will
never
compass
it
for
form
will
never
contain
it
nor
shall
we
ever
see
that
is
know
god
perfectly
we
shall
indeed
never
absolutely
know
man
or
woman
or
child
but
we
may
know
god
as
we
never
can
know
human
being
as
we
never
can
know
ourselves
we
not
only
may
but
we
must
so
know
him
and
it
can
never
be
until
we
are
pure
in
heart
then
shall
we
know
him
with
the
infinitude
of
an
knowledge
is
it
then
to
be
pure
in
heart
i
answer
it
is
not
necessary
to
define
this
purity
or
to
have
in
the
mind
any
clear
form
of
it
for
even
to
know
perfectly
were
that
possible
what
purity
of
heart
is
would
not
be
to
be
pure
in
heart
then
am
i
to
try
after
it
can
i
do
so
without
knowing
what
it
is
though
you
do
not
know
any
definition
of
purity
you
know
enough
to
begin
to
be
pure
you
do
not
know
what
a
man
is
but
you
know
how
to
make
his
acquaintance
perhaps
even
how
to
gain
his
friendship
your
brain
does
not
know
what
purity
is
your
heart
has
some
acquaintance
with
purity
itself
your
brain
in
seeking
to
know
what
it
is
may
even
obstruct
your
heart
in
bettering
its
friendship
with
it
to
know
what
purity
is
a
man
must
already
be
pure
but
he
who
can
put
the
question
already
knows
enough
of
purity
i
repeat
to
begin
to
become
pure
if
this
moment
you
determine
to
start
for
purity
your
conscience
will
at
once
tell
you
where
to
begin
if
you
reply
conscience
says
nothing
definite
i
answer
are
but
playing
with
your
conscience
determine
and
it
will
speak
if
you
care
to
see
god
be
pure
if
you
will
not
be
pure
you
will
grow
more
and
more
impure
and
instead
of
seeing
god
will
at
length
find
yourself
face
to
face
with
a
vast
inane
a
vast
inane
yet
filled
full
of
one
inhabitant
that
devouring
monster
your
own
false
self
if
for
this
neither
do
you
care
i
tell
you
there
is
a
power
that
will
not
have
it
so
a
love
that
will
make
you
care
by
the
consequences
of
not
caring
you
who
seek
purity
and
would
have
your
also
seek
it
spend
not
your
labour
on
the
stony
ground
of
their
intellect
endeavouring
to
explain
what
purity
is
give
their
imagination
the
one
pure
man
call
up
their
conscience
to
witness
against
their
own
deeds
urge
upon
them
the
grand
resolve
to
be
pure
with
the
first
endeavour
of
a
soul
toward
her
purity
will
begin
to
draw
nigh
calling
for
admittance
and
never
will
a
man
have
to
pause
in
the
divine
toil
asking
what
next
is
required
of
him
the
demands
of
the
indwelling
purity
will
ever
be
in
front
of
his
obedience
if
one
should
say
i
am
shut
out
from
this
blessing
i
am
not
pure
in
heart
never
shall
i
see
god
here
is
another
word
from
the
same
eternal
heart
to
comfort
him
making
his
grief
its
own
consolation
for
this
man
also
there
is
blessing
with
the
messenger
of
the
father
unhappy
men
were
we
if
god
were
the
god
of
the
perfected
only
and
not
of
the
growing
the
becoming
are
they
says
the
lord
concerning
the
not
yet
pure
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
for
they
shall
be
filled
filled
with
righteousness
they
are
pure
pure
they
shall
see
god
long
ere
the
lord
appeared
ever
since
man
was
on
the
earth
nay
surely
from
the
very
beginning
was
his
spirit
at
work
in
it
for
righteousness
in
the
fullness
of
time
he
came
in
his
own
human
person
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
he
came
to
his
own
of
the
same
mind
with
himself
who
hungered
and
thirsted
after
righteousness
they
should
be
fulfilled
of
righteousness
to
hunger
and
thirst
after
anything
implies
a
sore
personal
need
a
strong
desire
a
passion
for
that
thing
those
that
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
seek
with
their
whole
nature
the
design
of
that
nature
nothing
less
will
give
them
satisfaction
that
alone
will
set
them
at
ease
they
long
to
be
delivered
from
their
sins
to
send
them
away
to
be
clean
and
blessed
by
their
absence
in
a
word
to
become
men
god
men
for
sin
gone
all
the
rest
is
good
it
was
not
in
such
hearts
it
was
not
in
any
heart
that
the
revolting
legal
fiction
of
imputed
righteousness
arose
righteousness
itself
god
righteousness
rightness
in
their
own
being
in
heart
and
brain
and
hands
is
what
they
desire
of
such
men
was
nathanael
in
whom
was
no
guile
such
perhaps
was
nicodemus
too
although
he
did
come
to
jesus
by
night
such
was
zacchaeus
the
temple
could
do
nothing
to
deliver
them
but
by
their
very
futility
its
observances
had
done
their
work
developing
the
desires
they
could
not
meet
making
the
men
hunger
and
thirst
the
more
after
genuine
righteousness
the
lord
must
bring
them
this
bread
from
heaven
with
him
the
live
original
rightness
in
their
hearts
they
must
speedily
become
righteous
with
that
love
their
friend
who
is
at
once
both
the
root
and
the
flower
of
things
they
would
strive
vigorously
as
well
as
hunger
eagerly
after
righteousness
love
is
the
father
of
righteousness
it
could
not
be
and
could
not
be
hungered
after
but
for
love
the
lord
of
righteousness
himself
could
not
live
without
love
without
the
father
in
him
every
heart
was
created
for
and
can
live
no
otherwise
than
in
and
upon
love
eternal
perfect
pure
unchanging
and
love
necessitates
righteousness
in
how
many
souls
has
not
the
very
thought
of
a
real
god
waked
a
longing
to
be
different
to
be
pure
to
be
right
the
fact
that
this
feeling
is
possible
that
a
soul
can
become
dissatisfied
with
itself
and
desire
a
change
in
itself
reveals
god
as
an
essential
part
of
its
being
for
in
itself
the
soul
is
aware
that
it
can
not
be
what
it
would
what
it
ought
that
it
can
not
set
itself
right
a
need
has
been
generated
in
the
soul
for
which
the
soul
can
generate
no
supply
a
presence
higher
than
itself
must
have
caused
that
need
a
power
greater
than
itself
must
supply
it
for
the
soul
knows
its
very
need
its
very
lack
is
of
something
greater
than
itself
but
the
primal
need
of
the
human
soul
is
yet
greater
than
this
the
longing
after
righteousness
is
only
one
of
the
manifestations
of
it
the
need
itself
is
that
of
not
for
the
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
the
causing
it
is
the
man
need
of
god
a
moral
that
is
a
human
a
spiritual
being
must
either
be
god
or
one
with
god
this
truth
begins
to
reveal
itself
when
the
man
begins
to
feel
that
he
can
not
cast
out
the
thing
he
hates
can
not
be
the
thing
he
loves
that
he
hates
thus
that
he
loves
thus
is
because
god
is
in
him
but
he
finds
he
has
not
enough
of
god
his
awaking
strength
manifests
itself
in
his
sense
of
weakness
for
only
strength
can
know
itself
weak
the
negative
can
not
know
itself
at
all
weakness
can
not
know
itself
weak
it
is
a
little
strength
that
longs
for
more
it
is
infant
righteousness
that
hungers
after
righteousness
to
every
soul
dissatisfied
with
itself
comes
this
word
at
once
rousing
and
consoling
from
the
power
that
lives
and
makes
him
live
that
in
his
hungering
and
thirsting
he
is
blessed
for
he
shall
be
filled
his
hungering
and
thirsting
is
the
divine
pledge
of
the
divine
meal
the
more
he
hungers
and
thirsts
the
more
blessed
is
he
the
more
room
is
there
in
him
to
receive
that
which
god
is
yet
more
eager
to
give
than
he
to
have
it
is
the
miserable
emptiness
that
makes
a
man
hunger
and
thirst
and
as
the
body
so
the
soul
hungers
after
what
belongs
to
its
nature
a
man
hungers
and
thirsts
after
righteousness
because
his
nature
needs
it
needs
it
because
it
was
made
for
it
his
soul
desires
its
own
his
nature
is
good
and
desires
more
good
therefore
that
he
is
empty
of
good
needs
discourage
no
one
for
what
is
emptiness
but
room
to
be
filled
emptiness
is
need
of
good
the
emptiness
that
desires
good
is
itself
good
even
if
the
hunger
after
righteousness
should
in
part
spring
from
a
desire
after
it
is
not
therefore
false
a
man
could
not
even
be
ashamed
of
himself
without
some
sense
of
the
beauty
of
rightness
by
divine
degrees
the
man
will
at
length
grow
sick
of
himself
and
desire
righteousness
with
a
pure
hunger
just
as
a
man
longs
to
eat
that
which
is
good
nor
thinks
of
the
strength
it
will
restore
to
be
filled
with
righteousness
will
be
to
forget
even
righteousness
itself
in
the
bliss
of
being
righteous
that
is
a
child
of
god
the
thought
of
righteousness
will
vanish
in
the
fact
of
righteousness
when
a
creature
is
just
what
he
is
meant
to
be
what
only
he
is
fit
to
be
when
therefore
he
is
truly
himself
he
never
thinks
what
he
is
he
that
thing
why
think
about
it
it
is
no
longer
outside
of
him
that
he
should
contemplate
or
desire
it
god
made
man
and
woke
in
him
the
hunger
for
righteousness
the
lord
came
to
enlarge
and
rouse
this
hunger
the
first
and
lasting
effect
of
his
words
must
be
to
make
the
hungering
and
thirsting
long
yet
more
if
their
passion
grow
to
a
despairing
sense
of
the
unattainable
a
hopelessness
of
ever
gaining
that
without
which
life
were
worthless
let
them
remember
that
the
lord
congratulates
the
hungry
and
thirsty
so
sure
does
he
know
them
of
being
one
day
satisfied
their
hunger
is
a
precious
thing
to
have
none
the
less
that
it
were
a
bad
thing
to
retain
unappeased
it
springs
from
the
lack
but
also
from
the
love
of
good
and
its
presence
makes
it
possible
to
supply
the
lack
happy
then
ye
pining
souls
the
food
you
would
have
is
the
one
thing
the
lord
would
have
you
have
the
very
thing
he
came
to
bring
you
fear
not
ye
hungering
and
thirsting
you
shall
have
righteousness
enough
though
none
to
spare
none
to
spare
yet
enough
to
overflow
upon
every
man
see
how
the
lord
goes
on
filling
his
disciples
john
and
peter
and
james
and
paul
with
righteousness
from
within
what
honest
soul
interpreting
the
servant
by
the
master
and
unbiassed
by
the
tradition
of
them
that
would
shut
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
can
doubt
what
paul
means
by
righteousness
which
is
of
god
by
faith
he
was
taught
of
jesus
christ
through
the
words
he
had
spoken
and
the
man
who
does
not
understand
jesus
christ
will
never
understand
his
apostles
what
righteousness
could
st
paul
have
meant
but
the
same
the
lord
would
have
men
hunger
and
thirst
after
the
very
righteousness
wherewith
god
is
righteous
they
that
hunger
and
thirst
after
such
only
righteousness
shall
become
pure
in
heart
and
shall
see
god
if
your
hunger
seems
long
in
being
filled
it
is
well
it
should
seem
long
but
what
if
your
righteousness
tarry
because
your
hunger
after
it
is
not
eager
there
are
who
sit
long
at
the
table
because
their
desire
is
slow
they
eat
as
who
should
say
we
need
no
food
in
things
spiritual
increasing
desire
is
the
sign
that
satisfaction
is
drawing
nearer
but
it
were
better
to
hunger
after
righteousness
for
ever
than
to
dull
the
sense
of
lack
with
the
husks
of
the
christian
scribes
and
lawyers
he
who
trusts
in
the
atonement
instead
of
in
the
father
of
jesus
christ
fills
his
fancy
with
the
chimeras
of
a
vulgar
legalism
not
his
heart
with
the
righteousness
of
god
hear
another
like
word
of
the
lord
he
assures
us
that
the
father
hears
the
cries
of
his
elect
of
those
whom
he
seeks
to
worship
him
because
they
worship
in
spirit
and
in
truth
not
god
avenge
his
own
elect
he
says
cry
day
and
night
unto
him
now
what
can
elect
have
to
keep
on
crying
for
night
and
day
but
righteousness
he
allows
that
god
seems
to
put
off
answering
them
but
assures
us
he
will
answer
them
speedily
even
now
he
must
be
busy
answering
their
prayers
increasing
hunger
is
the
best
possible
indication
that
he
is
doing
so
for
some
divine
reason
it
is
well
they
should
not
yet
know
in
themselves
that
he
is
answering
their
prayers
but
the
day
must
come
when
we
shall
be
righteous
even
as
he
is
righteous
when
no
word
of
his
will
miss
being
understood
because
of
our
lack
of
righteousness
when
no
unrighteousness
shall
hide
from
our
eyes
the
face
of
the
father
these
two
promises
of
seeing
god
and
being
filled
with
righteousness
have
place
between
the
individual
man
and
his
father
in
heaven
directly
the
promise
i
now
come
to
has
place
between
a
man
and
his
god
as
the
god
of
other
men
also
as
the
father
of
the
whole
family
in
heaven
and
earth
are
the
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
those
that
are
on
their
way
to
see
god
those
who
are
growing
pure
in
heart
through
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
are
indeed
the
children
of
god
but
specially
the
lord
calls
those
his
children
who
on
their
way
home
are
in
the
travelling
company
for
surely
those
in
any
family
are
specially
the
children
who
make
peace
with
and
among
the
rest
the
true
idea
of
the
universe
is
the
whole
family
in
heaven
and
earth
all
the
children
in
this
part
of
it
the
earth
at
least
are
not
good
children
but
however
far
therefore
the
earth
is
from
being
a
true
portion
of
a
real
family
the
at
the
root
of
the
world
that
by
and
for
which
it
exists
is
its
relation
to
god
the
father
of
men
for
the
development
of
this
germ
in
the
consciousness
of
the
children
the
church
whose
idea
is
the
purer
family
within
the
more
mixed
ever
growing
as
leaven
within
the
meal
by
absorption
but
which
itself
is
alas
not
easily
distinguishable
from
the
world
it
would
change
is
one
of
the
passing
means
for
the
same
purpose
the
whole
divine
family
is
made
up
of
numberless
human
families
that
in
these
men
may
learn
and
begin
to
love
one
another
god
then
would
make
of
the
world
a
true
divine
family
now
the
primary
necessity
to
the
very
existence
of
a
family
is
peace
many
a
human
family
is
no
family
and
the
world
is
no
family
yet
for
the
lack
of
peace
wherever
peace
is
growing
there
of
course
is
the
live
peace
counteracting
disruption
and
disintegration
and
helping
the
development
of
the
true
essential
family
the
one
question
therefore
as
to
any
family
is
whether
peace
or
strife
be
on
the
increase
in
it
for
peace
alone
makes
it
possible
for
the
binding
of
life
love
namely
and
justice
to
spread
throughout
what
were
else
but
a
heap
of
still
drifting
sand
the
quiet
the
winds
of
the
world
ever
ready
to
be
up
and
blowing
they
tend
and
cherish
the
interlacing
roots
of
the
ministering
grass
they
spin
and
twist
many
uniting
cords
and
they
weave
many
supporting
bands
they
are
the
servants
for
the
sake
of
the
individual
of
the
family
of
the
world
of
the
great
universal
family
of
heaven
and
earth
they
are
the
true
children
of
that
family
the
allies
and
ministers
of
every
clasping
and
consolidating
force
in
it
they
are
with
god
in
the
creation
of
the
family
they
help
him
to
get
it
to
his
mind
to
perfect
his
ever
radiating
peace
they
welcome
love
but
do
not
seek
it
they
provoke
no
jealousy
they
are
the
children
of
god
for
like
him
they
would
be
one
with
his
creatures
his
eldest
son
his
very
likeness
was
the
first
of
the
preaching
peace
to
them
that
were
afar
off
and
them
that
were
nigh
he
stood
undefended
in
the
turbulent
crowd
of
his
fellows
and
it
was
only
over
his
dead
body
that
his
brothers
began
to
come
together
in
the
peace
that
will
not
be
broken
he
rose
again
from
the
dead
his
brothers
like
himself
are
dying
unto
sin
and
not
yet
have
the
evil
children
made
their
father
hate
or
their
elder
brother
flinch
on
the
other
hand
those
whose
influence
is
to
divide
and
separate
causing
the
hearts
of
men
to
lean
away
from
each
other
make
themselves
the
children
of
the
evil
one
born
of
god
and
not
of
the
devil
they
turn
from
god
and
adopt
the
devil
their
father
they
set
their
life
against
god
against
the
whole
creative
redemptive
purpose
of
his
unifying
will
ever
obstructing
the
one
prayer
of
the
that
the
children
may
be
one
with
him
in
the
father
against
the
of
creation
against
that
for
which
the
son
yielded
himself
utterly
the
sowers
of
strife
the
fomenters
of
discord
contend
ceaseless
they
do
their
part
with
all
the
other
powers
of
evil
to
make
the
world
which
the
love
of
god
holds
together
a
world
at
least
though
not
yet
a
family
one
heaving
mass
of
dissolution
but
they
labour
in
vain
through
the
mass
and
through
it
that
it
may
cohere
this
way
and
that
guided
in
dance
inexplicable
of
prophetic
harmony
move
the
children
of
god
the
lights
of
the
world
the
lovers
of
men
the
with
god
the
ever
weaving
after
a
pattern
devised
by
and
known
only
to
him
who
orders
their
ways
the
web
of
the
world
history
but
for
them
the
world
would
have
no
history
it
would
vanish
a
cloud
of
windborne
dust
as
in
his
labour
so
shall
these
share
in
the
joy
of
god
in
the
divine
fruition
of
victorious
endeavour
blessed
are
the
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
children
because
they
set
the
father
on
the
throne
of
the
family
the
main
practical
difficulty
with
some
at
least
of
the
is
how
to
carry
themselves
toward
the
undoers
of
peace
the
disuniters
of
souls
perhaps
the
most
potent
of
these
are
not
those
powers
of
the
church
visible
who
care
for
canon
and
dogma
more
than
for
truth
and
for
the
church
more
than
for
christ
who
take
uniformity
for
unity
who
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
nor
knowing
what
spirit
they
are
of
such
men
i
say
are
perhaps
neither
the
most
active
nor
the
most
potent
force
working
for
the
disintegration
of
the
body
of
christ
i
imagine
also
that
neither
are
the
of
politics
the
worst
foes
to
divine
unity
ungenerous
and
often
knowingly
false
as
they
are
to
their
opponents
to
whom
they
seem
to
have
no
desire
to
be
honest
and
fair
i
think
rather
they
must
be
the
babbling
liars
of
the
social
circle
and
the
faithless
brothers
and
unloving
sisters
of
disunited
human
families
but
why
inquire
every
every
form
of
however
small
or
poor
or
grotesque
is
a
separating
and
scattering
force
and
these
forces
are
multitudinous
these
points
of
radial
repulsion
are
innumerable
because
of
the
prevailing
passion
of
mean
souls
to
seem
great
and
feel
important
if
such
can
not
hope
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
world
if
they
can
not
even
become
cynosure
of
neighbouring
eyes
they
will
in
what
sphere
they
may
call
their
own
however
small
it
be
try
to
make
a
party
for
themselves
each
revolving
on
his
or
her
own
axis
will
attempt
to
a
private
whirlpool
of
human
monads
to
draw
such
a
surrounding
the
partisan
of
self
will
sometimes
gnaw
asunder
the
most
precious
of
bonds
poison
whole
broods
of
infant
loves
such
real
schismatics
go
about
where
not
inventing
evil
yet
rejoicing
in
iniquity
mishearing
misrepresenting
paralyzing
affection
separating
hearts
their
chosen
calling
is
that
of
the
the
child
of
the
dividing
devil
they
belong
to
the
class
of
whom
dante
places
in
the
lowest
infernal
gulf
as
their
proper
home
many
a
woman
who
now
imagines
herself
standing
well
in
morals
and
religion
will
find
herself
at
last
just
such
a
child
of
the
devil
and
her
misery
will
be
the
hope
of
her
redemption
but
it
is
not
for
her
sake
that
i
write
these
things
would
such
a
woman
recognize
her
own
likeness
were
i
to
set
it
down
as
close
as
words
could
draw
it
i
am
rather
as
one
groping
after
some
light
on
the
true
behaviour
toward
her
kind
are
we
to
treat
persons
known
for
liars
and
as
the
children
of
the
devil
or
not
are
we
to
turn
away
from
them
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
them
rousing
an
ignorant
strife
of
tongues
concerning
our
conduct
are
we
guilty
of
connivance
when
silent
as
to
the
ambush
whence
we
know
the
wicked
arrow
privily
shot
are
we
to
call
the
traitor
to
account
or
are
we
to
give
warning
of
any
sort
i
have
no
answer
each
must
carry
the
question
that
perplexes
to
the
light
of
the
world
to
what
purpose
is
the
spirit
of
god
promised
to
them
that
ask
it
if
not
to
help
them
order
their
way
aright
one
thing
is
plain
that
we
must
love
the
another
is
nearly
as
plain
that
if
we
do
not
love
him
we
must
leave
him
alone
for
without
love
there
can
be
no
and
words
will
but
occasion
more
strife
to
be
kind
neither
hurts
nor
compromises
kindness
has
many
phases
and
the
fitting
form
of
it
may
avoid
offence
and
must
avoid
untruth
we
must
not
fear
what
man
can
do
to
us
but
commit
our
way
to
the
father
of
the
family
we
must
be
nowise
anxious
to
defend
ourselves
and
if
not
ourselves
because
god
is
our
defence
then
why
our
friends
is
he
not
their
defence
as
much
as
ours
commit
thy
friend
cause
also
to
him
who
judgeth
righteously
be
ready
to
bear
testimony
for
thy
friend
as
thou
wouldst
to
receive
the
blow
struck
at
him
but
do
not
plunge
into
a
nest
of
scorpions
to
rescue
his
handkerchief
be
true
to
him
thyself
nor
spare
to
show
thou
lovest
and
honourest
him
but
defence
may
dishonour
men
may
say
what
is
thy
friend
esteem
then
so
small
he
is
unwise
who
drags
a
rich
veil
from
a
whatever
our
relation
then
with
any
our
mercy
must
ever
be
within
call
and
it
may
help
us
against
an
indignation
too
strong
to
be
pure
to
remember
that
when
any
man
is
reviled
for
then
is
he
blessed
reward
of
are
the
merciful
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
are
they
which
are
persecuted
for
righteousness
sake
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven
for
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
which
were
before
you
mercy
can
not
get
in
where
mercy
goes
not
out
the
outgoing
makes
way
for
the
incoming
god
takes
the
part
of
humanity
against
the
man
the
man
must
treat
men
as
he
would
have
god
treat
him
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
the
lord
says
heavenly
father
will
also
forgive
you
but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
father
forgive
your
trespasses
and
in
the
prophecy
of
the
judgment
of
the
son
of
man
he
represents
himself
as
saying
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
but
the
demand
for
mercy
is
far
from
being
for
the
sake
only
of
the
man
who
needs
his
neighbour
mercy
it
is
greatly
more
for
the
sake
of
the
man
who
must
show
the
mercy
it
is
a
small
thing
to
a
man
whether
or
not
his
neighbour
be
merciful
to
him
it
is
life
or
death
to
him
whether
or
not
he
be
merciful
to
his
neighbour
the
greatest
mercy
that
can
be
shown
to
man
is
to
make
him
merciful
therefore
if
he
will
not
be
merciful
the
mercy
of
god
must
compel
him
thereto
in
the
parable
of
the
king
taking
account
of
his
servants
he
delivers
the
unmerciful
debtor
to
the
tormentors
he
should
pay
all
that
was
due
unto
him
the
king
had
forgiven
his
debtor
but
as
the
debtor
refuses
to
pass
on
the
forgiveness
to
his
neighbour
the
only
way
to
make
a
return
in
kind
the
king
withdraws
his
forgiveness
if
we
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
our
trespasses
remain
for
how
can
god
in
any
sense
forgive
remit
or
send
away
the
sin
which
a
man
insists
on
retaining
unmerciful
we
must
be
given
up
to
the
tormentors
until
we
learn
to
be
merciful
god
is
merciful
we
must
be
merciful
there
is
no
blessedness
except
in
being
such
as
god
it
would
be
altogether
unmerciful
to
leave
us
unmerciful
the
reward
of
the
merciful
is
that
by
their
mercy
they
are
rendered
capable
of
receiving
the
mercy
of
god
yea
god
himself
who
is
mercy
that
men
may
be
drawn
to
taste
and
see
and
understand
the
lord
associates
reward
with
righteousness
the
lord
would
have
men
love
righteousness
but
how
are
they
to
love
it
without
being
acquainted
with
it
how
are
they
to
go
on
loving
it
without
a
growing
knowledge
of
it
to
draw
them
toward
it
that
they
may
begin
to
know
it
and
to
encourage
them
when
assailed
by
the
disappointments
that
accompany
endeavour
he
tells
them
simply
a
truth
concerning
it
that
in
the
doing
of
it
there
is
great
reward
let
no
one
start
with
dismay
at
the
idea
of
a
reward
of
righteousness
saying
virtue
is
its
own
reward
is
not
virtue
then
a
reward
is
any
other
imaginable
reward
worth
mentioning
beside
it
true
the
man
may
after
this
mode
or
that
mistake
the
reward
promised
not
the
less
must
he
have
it
or
perish
who
will
count
himself
deceived
by
overfulfilment
would
a
parent
be
deceiving
his
child
in
saying
boy
you
will
have
a
great
reward
if
you
learn
greek
foreseeing
his
son
delight
in
homer
and
plato
now
but
a
valueless
waste
in
his
eyes
when
his
reward
comes
will
the
youth
feel
aggrieved
that
it
is
greek
and
not
the
nature
indeed
of
the
lord
promised
rewards
is
hardly
to
be
mistaken
yet
the
foolish
remarks
one
sometimes
hears
make
me
wish
to
point
out
that
neither
is
the
lord
proclaiming
an
ethical
system
nor
does
he
make
the
blunder
of
representing
as
righteousness
the
doing
of
a
good
thing
because
of
some
advantage
to
be
thereby
gained
when
he
promises
he
only
states
some
fact
that
will
encourage
his
disciples
that
is
all
who
learn
of
him
to
meet
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
doing
right
and
so
learning
righteousness
his
object
being
to
make
men
righteous
not
to
teach
them
philosophy
i
doubt
if
those
who
would
on
the
ground
of
mentioned
reward
set
aside
the
teaching
of
the
lord
are
as
anxious
to
be
righteous
as
they
are
to
prove
him
unrighteous
if
they
were
they
would
i
think
take
more
care
to
represent
him
truly
they
would
make
farther
search
into
the
thing
nor
be
willing
that
he
whom
the
world
confesses
its
best
man
and
whom
they
themselves
perhaps
confess
their
superior
in
conduct
should
be
found
less
pure
in
theory
than
they
must
the
lord
hide
from
his
friends
that
they
will
have
cause
to
rejoice
that
they
have
been
obedient
must
he
give
them
no
help
to
counterbalance
the
load
with
which
they
start
on
their
race
is
he
to
tell
them
the
horrors
of
the
persecutions
that
await
them
and
not
the
sweet
sympathies
that
will
help
them
through
was
it
wrong
to
assure
them
that
where
he
was
going
they
should
go
also
the
lord
could
not
demand
of
them
more
righteousness
than
he
does
ye
therefore
perfect
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
but
not
to
help
them
by
word
of
love
deed
of
power
and
promise
of
good
would
have
shown
him
far
less
of
a
brother
and
a
saviour
it
is
the
part
of
the
enemy
of
righteousness
to
increase
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
becoming
righteous
and
to
diminish
those
in
the
way
of
seeming
righteous
jesus
desires
no
righteousness
for
the
pride
of
being
righteous
any
more
than
for
advantage
to
be
gained
by
it
therefore
while
requiring
such
purity
as
the
man
beforehand
is
unable
to
imagine
he
gives
him
all
the
encouragement
he
can
he
will
not
enhance
his
victory
by
difficulties
of
them
there
are
enough
but
by
completeness
he
will
not
demand
the
loftiest
motives
in
the
yet
far
from
loftiest
soul
to
those
the
soul
must
grow
he
will
hearten
the
child
with
promises
and
fulfil
them
to
the
contentment
of
the
man
men
can
not
be
righteous
without
love
to
love
a
righteous
man
is
the
best
the
only
way
to
learn
righteousness
the
lord
gives
us
himself
to
love
and
promises
his
closest
friendship
to
them
that
overcome
god
rewards
are
always
in
kind
am
your
father
be
my
children
and
i
will
be
your
father
every
obedience
is
the
opening
of
another
door
into
the
boundless
universe
of
life
so
long
as
the
constitution
of
that
universe
remains
so
long
as
the
world
continues
to
be
made
by
god
righteousness
can
never
fail
of
perfect
reward
before
it
could
be
otherwise
the
government
must
have
passed
into
other
hands
the
idea
of
merit
is
nowise
essential
to
that
of
reward
jesus
tells
us
that
the
lord
who
finds
his
servant
faithful
will
make
him
sit
down
to
meat
and
come
forth
and
serve
him
he
says
likewise
ye
have
done
all
say
we
are
unprofitable
servants
we
have
done
only
that
which
it
was
our
duty
to
do
reward
is
the
rebound
of
virtue
ball
from
the
hand
of
love
a
sense
of
merit
is
the
most
sneaking
shape
that
can
assume
god
reward
lies
closed
in
all
the
doer
of
right
grows
better
and
humbler
and
comes
nearer
to
god
heart
as
nearer
to
his
likeness
grows
more
capable
of
own
blessedness
and
of
inheriting
the
kingdoms
of
heaven
and
earth
to
be
made
greater
than
one
fellows
is
the
offered
reward
of
hell
and
involves
no
greatness
to
be
made
greater
than
one
self
is
the
divine
reward
and
involves
a
real
greatness
a
man
might
be
set
above
all
his
fellows
to
be
but
so
much
less
than
he
was
before
a
man
can
not
be
raised
a
above
himself
without
rising
nearer
to
god
the
reward
itself
then
is
righteousness
and
the
man
who
was
righteous
for
the
sake
of
such
reward
knowing
what
it
was
would
be
righteous
for
the
sake
of
righteousness
which
yet
however
would
not
be
perfection
but
i
must
distinguish
and
divide
no
farther
now
the
reward
of
mercy
is
not
often
of
this
world
the
merciful
do
not
often
receive
mercy
in
return
from
their
fellows
perhaps
they
do
not
often
receive
much
gratitude
none
the
less
being
the
children
of
their
father
in
heaven
will
they
go
on
to
show
mercy
even
to
their
enemies
they
must
give
like
god
and
like
god
be
blessed
in
giving
there
is
a
mercy
that
lies
in
the
endeavour
to
share
with
others
the
best
things
god
has
given
they
who
do
so
will
be
persecuted
and
reviled
and
slandered
as
well
as
thanked
and
loved
and
befriended
the
lord
not
only
promises
the
greatest
possible
reward
he
tells
his
disciples
the
worst
they
have
to
expect
he
not
only
shows
them
the
fair
countries
to
which
they
are
bound
he
tells
them
the
truth
of
the
rough
weather
and
the
hardships
of
the
way
he
will
not
have
them
choose
in
ignorance
at
the
same
time
he
strengthens
them
to
meet
coming
difficulty
by
instructing
them
in
its
real
nature
all
this
is
part
of
his
preparation
of
them
for
his
work
for
taking
his
yoke
upon
them
and
becoming
with
him
in
his
father
vineyard
they
must
not
imagine
because
they
are
the
servants
of
his
father
that
therefore
they
shall
find
their
work
easy
they
shall
only
find
the
reward
great
neither
will
he
have
them
fancy
when
evil
comes
upon
them
that
something
unforeseen
unprovided
for
has
befallen
them
it
is
just
then
on
the
contrary
that
their
reward
comes
nigh
when
men
revile
them
and
persecute
them
then
they
may
know
that
they
are
blessed
their
suffering
is
ground
for
rejoicing
for
exceeding
gladness
the
ignominy
cast
upon
them
leaves
the
name
of
the
lord
father
written
upon
their
foreheads
the
mark
of
the
true
among
the
false
of
the
children
among
the
slaves
with
all
who
suffer
for
the
world
persecution
is
the
seal
of
their
patent
a
sign
that
they
were
sent
they
fill
up
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
for
his
body
sake
let
us
look
at
the
similar
words
the
lord
spoke
in
a
later
address
to
his
disciples
in
the
presence
of
thousands
on
the
plain
supplemented
with
lamentation
over
such
as
have
what
they
desire
st
luke
vi
be
ye
poor
for
yours
is
the
kingdom
of
god
blessed
are
ye
that
hunger
now
for
ye
shall
be
filled
blessed
are
ye
that
weep
now
for
ye
shall
laugh
blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
hate
you
and
when
they
shall
separate
you
from
their
company
and
shall
reproach
you
and
cast
out
your
name
as
evil
for
the
son
of
man
sake
rejoice
ye
in
that
day
and
leap
for
joy
for
behold
your
reward
is
great
in
heaven
for
in
the
like
manner
did
their
fathers
unto
the
woe
unto
you
that
are
rich
for
ye
have
received
your
consolation
woe
unto
you
that
are
full
for
ye
shall
hunger
woe
unto
you
that
laugh
now
for
ye
shall
mourn
and
weep
woe
unto
you
when
all
men
shall
speak
well
of
you
for
so
did
their
fathers
to
the
false
prophets
on
this
occasion
he
uses
the
word
without
limitation
every
true
want
every
genuine
need
every
hunger
is
a
thing
provided
for
in
the
idea
of
the
universe
but
no
attempt
to
fill
a
void
otherwise
than
the
heart
of
the
universe
intended
and
intends
is
or
can
be
anything
but
a
woe
god
forgets
none
of
his
children
the
naughty
ones
any
more
than
the
good
love
and
reward
is
for
the
good
love
and
correction
for
the
bad
the
bad
ones
will
trouble
the
good
but
shall
do
them
no
hurt
the
evil
a
man
does
to
his
neighbour
shall
do
his
neighbour
no
harm
shall
work
indeed
for
his
good
but
he
himself
will
have
to
mourn
for
his
doing
a
sore
injury
to
himself
it
is
to
his
neighbour
a
cause
of
jubilation
not
for
the
evil
the
man
does
to
himself
over
that
there
is
sorrow
in
heaven
but
for
the
good
it
occasions
his
neighbour
the
poor
the
hungry
the
weeping
the
hated
may
lament
their
lot
as
if
god
had
forgotten
them
but
god
is
all
the
time
caring
for
them
blessed
in
his
sight
now
they
shall
soon
know
themselves
blessed
are
ye
that
weep
now
for
ye
shall
laugh
welcome
words
from
the
glad
heart
of
the
saviour
do
they
not
make
our
hearts
burn
within
us
they
shall
be
comforted
even
to
laughter
the
poor
the
hungry
the
weeping
the
hated
the
persecuted
are
the
powerful
the
opulent
the
merry
the
loved
the
victorious
of
god
kingdom
to
be
filled
with
good
things
to
laugh
for
very
delight
to
be
honoured
and
sought
and
cherished
but
such
as
have
their
poor
consolation
in
this
life
alas
for
them
for
those
who
have
yet
to
learn
what
hunger
is
for
those
whose
laughter
is
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
for
those
who
have
loved
and
gathered
the
praises
of
men
for
the
rich
the
jocund
the
evil
is
on
its
way
to
seize
them
dives
must
go
without
lazarus
must
have
god
education
makes
use
of
terrible
extremes
there
are
last
that
shall
be
first
and
first
that
shall
be
last
the
lord
knew
what
trials
what
tortures
even
awaited
his
disciples
after
his
death
he
knew
they
would
need
every
encouragement
he
could
give
them
to
keep
their
hearts
strong
lest
in
some
moment
of
dismay
they
should
deny
him
if
they
had
denied
him
where
would
our
gospel
be
if
there
are
none
able
and
ready
to
be
crucified
for
him
now
alas
for
the
age
to
come
what
a
poor
travesty
of
the
good
news
of
god
will
arrive
at
their
doors
those
whom
our
lord
felicitates
are
all
the
children
of
one
family
and
everything
that
can
be
called
blessed
or
blessing
comes
of
the
same
righteousness
if
a
disciple
be
blessed
because
of
any
one
thing
every
other
blessing
is
either
his
or
on
the
way
to
become
his
for
he
is
on
the
way
to
receive
the
very
righteousness
of
god
each
good
thing
opens
the
door
to
the
one
next
it
so
to
all
the
rest
but
as
if
these
his
assurances
and
promises
and
comfortings
were
not
large
enough
as
if
the
mention
of
any
condition
whatever
might
discourage
some
humble
man
of
heart
with
a
sense
of
unfitness
with
the
fear
perhaps
conviction
that
the
promise
was
not
for
him
as
if
some
one
might
say
i
am
proud
and
neither
poor
in
spirit
nor
meek
i
am
at
times
not
at
all
hungry
after
righteousness
i
am
not
half
merciful
and
am
very
ready
to
feel
hurt
and
indignant
i
am
shut
out
from
every
blessing
the
lord
knowing
the
multitudes
that
can
urge
nothing
in
their
own
favour
and
sorely
feel
they
are
not
blessed
looks
abroad
over
the
wide
world
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
calls
aloud
including
in
the
boundless
invitation
every
living
soul
with
but
the
one
qualification
of
unrest
or
discomfort
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
yoke
of
at
that
time
jesus
answered
and
said
according
to
luke
in
that
hour
jesus
rejoiced
in
spirit
and
said
thank
thee
o
father
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
because
thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
unto
babes
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
father
and
no
man
knoweth
the
son
according
to
luke
the
son
is
the
father
neither
knoweth
any
man
the
father
according
to
luke
the
father
is
the
son
and
he
to
whomsoever
the
son
will
reveal
him
xi
x
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
take
my
yoke
upon
you
and
learn
of
me
for
i
am
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
souls
for
my
yoke
is
easy
and
my
burden
is
light
xi
the
words
of
the
lord
in
the
former
two
of
these
paragraphs
are
represented
both
by
matthew
and
by
luke
as
spoken
after
the
denunciation
of
the
cities
of
chorazin
bethsaida
and
capernaum
only
in
luke
narrative
the
return
of
the
seventy
is
mentioned
between
and
there
the
rejoicing
of
the
lord
over
the
father
revelation
of
himself
to
babes
appears
to
have
reference
to
the
seventy
the
fact
that
the
return
of
the
seventy
is
not
mentioned
elsewhere
leaves
us
free
to
suppose
that
the
words
were
indeed
spoken
on
that
occasion
the
circumstances
however
as
circumstances
are
to
us
of
little
importance
not
being
necessary
to
the
understanding
of
the
words
the
lord
makes
no
complaint
against
the
wise
and
prudent
he
but
recognizes
that
they
are
not
those
to
whom
his
father
reveals
his
best
things
for
which
fact
and
the
reasons
of
it
he
thanks
or
praises
his
father
bless
thy
will
i
see
that
thou
art
right
i
am
of
one
mind
with
thee
something
of
each
of
these
phases
of
meaning
seems
to
belong
to
the
greek
word
why
not
reveal
true
things
first
to
the
wise
are
they
not
the
fittest
to
receive
them
yes
if
these
things
and
their
wisdom
lie
in
the
same
region
not
otherwise
no
amount
of
knowledge
or
skill
in
physical
science
will
make
a
man
the
fitter
to
argue
a
metaphysical
question
and
the
wisdom
of
this
world
meaning
by
the
term
the
philosophy
of
prudence
precaution
specially
unfits
a
man
for
receiving
what
the
father
has
to
reveal
in
proportion
to
our
care
about
our
own
well
being
is
our
incapability
of
understanding
and
welcoming
the
care
of
the
father
the
wise
and
the
prudent
with
all
their
energy
of
thought
could
never
see
the
things
of
the
father
sufficiently
to
recognize
them
as
true
their
sagacity
labours
in
earthly
things
and
so
fills
their
minds
with
their
own
questions
and
conclusions
that
they
can
not
see
the
eternal
foundations
god
has
laid
in
man
or
the
consequent
necessities
of
their
own
nature
they
are
proud
of
finding
out
things
but
the
things
they
find
out
are
all
less
than
themselves
because
however
they
have
discovered
them
they
imagine
such
things
the
goal
of
the
human
intellect
if
they
grant
there
may
be
things
beyond
those
they
either
count
them
beyond
their
reach
or
declare
themselves
uninterested
in
them
for
the
wise
and
prudent
they
do
not
exist
they
work
only
to
gather
by
the
senses
and
deduce
from
what
they
have
so
gathered
the
prudential
the
probable
the
expedient
the
protective
they
never
think
of
the
essential
of
what
in
itself
must
be
they
are
cautious
wary
discreet
judicious
circumspect
provident
temporizing
they
have
no
enthusiasm
and
are
shy
of
all
forms
of
it
a
clever
hard
thin
people
who
take
for
the
universe
and
love
of
facts
for
love
of
truth
they
know
nothing
deeper
in
man
than
mere
surface
mental
facts
and
their
relations
they
do
not
perceive
or
they
turn
away
from
any
truth
which
the
intellect
can
not
formulate
zeal
for
god
will
never
eat
them
up
why
should
it
he
is
not
interesting
to
them
theology
may
be
to
such
men
religion
means
theology
how
should
the
treasure
of
the
father
be
open
to
such
in
their
hands
his
rubies
would
draw
in
their
fire
and
cease
to
glow
the
roses
of
paradise
in
their
gardens
would
blow
withered
they
never
go
beyond
the
porch
of
the
temple
they
are
not
sure
whether
there
be
any
and
they
do
not
care
to
go
in
and
see
why
indeed
should
they
it
would
but
be
to
turn
and
come
out
again
even
when
they
know
their
duty
they
must
take
it
to
pieces
and
consider
the
grounds
of
its
claim
before
they
will
render
it
obedience
all
those
evil
doctrines
about
god
that
work
misery
and
madness
have
their
origin
in
the
brains
of
the
wise
and
prudent
not
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
these
wise
and
prudent
careful
to
make
the
words
of
his
messengers
rime
with
their
conclusions
interpret
the
great
heart
of
god
not
by
their
own
hearts
but
by
their
miserable
intellects
and
postponing
the
obedience
which
alone
can
give
power
to
the
understanding
press
upon
men
minds
their
wretched
interpretations
of
the
will
of
the
father
instead
of
the
doing
of
that
will
upon
their
hearts
they
call
their
philosophy
the
truth
of
god
and
say
men
must
hold
it
or
stand
outside
they
are
the
slaves
of
the
letter
in
all
its
weakness
and
imperfection
and
will
be
until
the
spirit
of
the
word
the
spirit
of
obedience
shall
set
them
free
the
babes
must
beware
lest
the
wise
and
prudent
come
between
them
and
the
father
they
must
yield
no
claim
to
authority
over
their
belief
made
by
man
or
community
by
church
any
more
than
by
synagogue
that
alone
is
for
them
to
believe
which
the
lord
reveals
to
their
souls
as
true
that
alone
is
it
possible
for
them
to
believe
with
what
he
counts
belief
the
divine
object
for
which
teacher
or
church
exists
is
the
persuasion
of
the
individual
heart
to
come
to
jesus
the
spirit
to
be
taught
what
he
alone
can
teach
terribly
has
his
gospel
suffered
in
the
mouths
of
the
wise
and
prudent
how
would
it
be
faring
now
had
its
first
messages
been
committed
to
persons
of
repute
instead
of
those
simple
fishermen
it
would
be
nowhere
or
if
anywhere
unrecognizable
from
the
first
we
should
have
had
a
system
founded
on
a
human
interpretation
of
the
divine
gospel
instead
of
the
gospel
itself
which
would
have
disappeared
as
it
is
we
have
had
one
dull
miserable
human
system
after
another
usurping
its
place
but
thank
god
the
gospel
remains
the
little
child
heedless
of
his
trailing
cloud
of
glory
and
looking
about
him
aghast
in
an
unknown
world
may
yet
see
and
run
to
the
arms
open
to
the
children
how
often
has
not
some
symbol
employed
in
the
new
testament
been
forced
into
the
service
of
argument
for
one
or
another
contemptible
scheme
of
redemption
which
were
no
redemption
while
the
truth
for
the
sake
of
which
the
symbol
was
used
the
thing
meant
to
be
conveyed
by
it
has
lain
unregarded
beside
the
heap
of
rubbish
had
the
wise
and
prudent
been
the
confidants
of
god
i
repeat
the
letter
would
at
once
have
usurped
the
place
of
the
spirit
the
ministering
slave
would
have
been
set
over
the
household
a
system
of
religion
with
its
rickety
malodorous
plan
of
salvation
would
not
only
have
at
once
been
put
in
the
place
of
a
living
christ
but
would
yet
have
held
that
place
the
great
brother
the
human
god
the
eternal
son
the
living
one
would
have
been
as
utterly
hidden
from
the
tearful
eyes
and
aching
hearts
of
the
weary
and
as
if
he
had
never
come
from
the
deeps
of
love
to
call
the
children
home
out
of
the
shadows
of
a
universe
but
the
father
revealed
the
father
things
to
his
babes
the
babes
loved
and
began
to
do
them
therewith
began
to
understand
them
and
went
on
growing
in
the
knowledge
of
them
and
in
the
power
of
communicating
them
while
to
the
wise
and
prudent
the
deepest
words
of
the
most
of
them
all
john
boanerges
even
now
appear
but
a
rosary
of
platitudes
the
babe
understands
the
wise
and
prudent
but
is
understood
only
by
the
babe
the
father
then
revealed
his
things
to
babes
because
the
babes
were
his
own
little
ones
uncorrupted
by
the
wisdom
or
the
care
of
this
world
and
therefore
able
to
receive
them
the
others
though
his
children
had
not
begun
to
be
like
him
therefore
could
not
receive
them
the
father
things
could
not
have
got
anyhow
into
their
minds
without
leaving
all
their
value
all
their
spirit
outside
the
unchildlike
place
the
babes
are
near
enough
whence
they
come
to
understand
a
little
how
things
go
in
the
presence
of
their
father
in
heaven
and
thereby
to
interpret
the
words
of
the
son
the
child
who
has
not
yet
above
a
mile
or
two
from
his
love
is
not
out
of
touch
with
the
mind
of
his
father
quickly
will
he
seal
the
old
bond
when
the
son
himself
the
first
of
the
babes
the
one
perfect
babe
of
god
comes
to
lead
the
children
out
of
the
lovely
of
into
the
land
of
the
celestial
thought
as
god
is
the
one
only
real
father
so
is
it
only
to
god
that
any
one
can
be
a
perfect
child
in
his
garden
only
can
childhood
blossom
the
leader
of
the
great
array
of
little
ones
himself
in
virtue
of
his
firstborn
childhood
the
first
recipient
of
the
revelations
of
his
father
having
thus
given
thanks
and
said
why
he
gave
thanks
breaks
out
afresh
renewing
expression
of
delight
that
god
had
willed
it
thus
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
i
venture
to
translate
o
father
for
thus
came
forth
satisfaction
before
thee
and
think
he
meant
father
for
thereat
were
all
thy
angels
filled
with
satisfaction
the
babes
were
the
prophets
in
heaven
and
the
angels
were
glad
to
find
it
was
to
be
so
upon
the
earth
also
they
rejoiced
to
see
that
what
was
bound
in
heaven
was
bound
on
earth
that
the
same
principle
held
in
each
compare
matt
xviii
and
also
luke
xv
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones
for
i
say
unto
you
that
their
angels
in
heaven
do
always
behold
the
face
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
thus
it
is
not
the
will
before
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
angels
who
stand
before
i
think
he
means
one
of
these
little
ones
should
perish
so
i
say
unto
you
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
having
thus
thanked
his
father
that
he
has
done
after
his
own
and
acceptable
and
perfect
will
he
turns
to
his
disciples
and
tells
them
that
he
knows
the
father
being
his
son
and
that
he
only
can
reveal
the
father
to
the
rest
of
his
children
things
are
delivered
unto
me
of
my
father
and
no
one
knoweth
the
son
but
the
father
neither
knoweth
any
one
the
father
save
the
son
and
he
to
whomsoever
the
son
willeth
to
reveal
him
it
is
almost
as
if
his
mention
of
the
babes
brought
his
thoughts
back
to
himself
and
his
father
between
whom
lay
the
secret
of
all
life
and
all
sending
yea
all
loving
the
relation
of
the
father
and
the
son
contains
the
idea
of
the
universe
jesus
tells
his
disciples
that
his
father
had
no
secrets
from
him
that
he
knew
the
father
as
the
father
knew
him
the
son
must
know
the
father
he
only
could
know
him
and
knowing
he
could
reveal
him
the
son
could
make
the
other
the
imperfect
children
know
the
father
and
so
become
such
as
he
all
things
were
given
unto
him
by
the
father
because
he
was
the
son
of
the
father
for
the
same
reason
he
could
reveal
the
things
of
the
father
to
the
child
of
the
father
the
is
the
one
eternal
ever
enduring
never
changing
relation
note
that
while
the
lord
here
represents
the
knowledge
his
father
and
he
have
each
of
the
other
as
limited
to
themselves
the
statement
is
one
of
fact
only
not
of
design
or
intention
his
presence
in
the
world
is
for
the
removal
of
that
limitation
the
father
knows
the
son
and
sends
him
to
us
that
we
may
know
him
the
son
knows
the
father
and
dies
to
reveal
him
the
glory
of
god
mysteries
is
that
they
are
for
his
children
to
look
into
when
the
lord
took
the
little
child
in
the
presence
of
his
disciples
and
declared
him
his
representative
he
made
him
the
representative
of
his
father
also
but
the
eternal
child
alone
can
reveal
him
to
reveal
is
immeasurably
more
than
to
represent
it
is
to
present
to
the
eyes
that
know
the
true
when
they
see
it
jesus
represented
god
the
spirit
of
jesus
reveals
god
the
represented
god
a
man
may
refuse
many
refused
the
lord
the
revealed
god
no
one
can
refuse
to
see
god
and
to
love
him
are
one
he
can
be
revealed
only
to
the
child
perfectly
to
the
pure
child
only
all
the
discipline
of
the
world
is
to
make
men
children
that
god
may
be
revealed
to
them
no
man
when
first
he
comes
to
himself
can
have
any
true
knowledge
of
god
he
can
only
have
a
desire
after
such
knowledge
but
while
he
does
not
know
him
at
all
he
can
not
become
in
his
heart
god
child
so
the
father
must
draw
nearer
to
him
he
sends
therefore
his
first
born
who
does
know
him
is
exactly
like
him
and
can
represent
him
perfectly
drawn
to
him
the
children
receive
him
and
then
he
is
able
to
reveal
the
father
to
them
no
wisdom
of
the
wise
can
find
out
god
no
words
of
the
can
reveal
him
the
simplicity
of
the
whole
natural
relation
is
too
deep
for
the
philosopher
the
son
alone
can
reveal
god
the
child
alone
understand
him
the
elder
brother
companies
with
the
younger
and
makes
him
yet
more
a
child
like
himself
he
interpenetrates
his
willing
companion
with
his
obedient
glory
he
lets
him
see
how
he
delights
in
his
father
and
lets
him
know
that
god
is
his
father
too
he
rouses
in
his
little
brother
the
sense
of
their
father
will
and
the
younger
as
he
hears
and
obeys
begins
to
see
that
his
elder
brother
must
be
the
very
image
of
their
father
he
becomes
more
and
more
of
a
child
and
more
and
more
the
son
reveals
to
him
the
father
for
he
knows
that
to
know
the
father
is
the
one
thing
needful
to
every
child
of
the
father
the
one
thing
to
fill
the
divine
gulf
of
his
necessity
to
see
the
father
is
the
cry
of
every
in
the
universe
of
the
father
is
the
need
where
not
the
cry
of
every
living
soul
comfort
yourselves
then
brothers
and
sisters
he
to
whom
the
son
will
reveal
him
shall
know
the
father
and
the
son
came
to
us
that
he
might
reveal
him
brother
we
cry
us
the
father
be
thyself
to
us
that
in
thee
we
may
know
him
we
too
are
his
children
let
the
other
children
share
with
thee
in
the
things
of
the
father
having
spoken
to
his
father
first
and
now
to
his
disciples
the
lord
turns
to
the
whole
world
and
lets
his
heart
overflow
st
matthew
alone
has
saved
for
us
the
eternal
cry
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
know
the
father
come
then
to
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
he
does
not
here
call
those
who
want
to
know
the
father
his
cry
goes
far
beyond
them
it
reaches
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
calls
those
who
are
weary
those
who
do
not
know
that
ignorance
of
the
father
is
the
cause
of
all
their
labour
and
the
heaviness
of
their
burden
unto
me
he
says
i
will
give
you
rest
this
is
the
lord
own
form
of
his
gospel
more
intensely
personal
and
direct
at
the
same
time
of
yet
wider
inclusion
than
that
which
at
nazareth
he
appropriated
from
isaiah
differing
from
it
also
in
this
that
it
is
interfused
with
strongest
persuasion
to
the
troubled
to
enter
into
and
share
his
own
eternal
rest
i
will
turn
his
argument
a
little
have
rest
because
i
know
the
father
be
meek
and
lowly
of
heart
toward
him
as
i
am
let
him
lay
his
yoke
upon
you
as
he
lays
it
on
me
i
do
his
will
not
my
own
take
on
you
the
yoke
that
i
wear
be
his
child
like
me
become
a
babe
to
whom
he
can
reveal
his
wonders
then
shall
you
too
find
rest
to
your
souls
you
shall
have
the
same
peace
i
have
you
will
be
weary
and
heavy
laden
no
more
i
find
my
yoke
easy
my
burden
light
we
must
not
imagine
that
when
the
lord
says
my
yoke
upon
you
he
means
a
yoke
which
he
lays
on
those
that
come
to
him
yoke
is
the
yoke
he
wears
himself
the
yoke
his
father
lays
upon
him
the
yoke
out
of
which
that
same
moment
he
speaks
bearing
it
with
glad
patience
must
take
on
you
the
yoke
i
have
taken
the
father
lays
it
upon
us
the
best
of
the
good
wine
remains
i
have
kept
it
to
the
last
a
friend
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
master
does
not
mean
we
must
take
on
us
a
yoke
like
his
we
must
take
on
us
the
very
yoke
he
is
carrying
dante
describing
how
on
the
first
terrace
of
purgatory
he
walked
stooping
to
be
on
a
level
with
oderisi
who
went
bowed
to
the
ground
by
the
ponderous
burden
of
the
pride
he
had
cherished
on
earth
says
went
walking
with
this
soul
just
as
oxen
walk
in
the
yoke
this
picture
almost
always
comes
to
me
with
the
words
of
the
lord
my
yoke
upon
you
and
learn
of
me
their
intent
is
the
other
end
of
my
yoke
doing
as
i
do
being
as
i
am
think
of
it
a
moment
to
walk
in
the
same
yoke
with
the
son
of
man
doing
the
same
labour
with
him
and
having
the
same
feeling
common
to
him
and
us
this
and
nothing
else
is
offered
the
man
who
would
have
rest
to
his
soul
is
required
of
the
man
who
would
know
the
father
is
by
the
lord
pressed
upon
him
to
whom
he
would
give
the
same
peace
which
pervades
and
sustains
his
own
eternal
heart
but
a
yoke
is
for
drawing
withal
what
load
is
it
the
lord
is
drawing
wherewith
is
the
cart
laden
which
he
would
have
us
help
him
draw
with
what
but
the
will
of
the
eternal
the
perfect
father
how
should
the
father
honour
the
son
but
by
giving
him
his
will
to
embody
in
deed
by
making
him
hand
to
his
father
heart
and
hardest
of
all
in
bringing
home
his
children
specially
in
drawing
this
load
must
his
share
how
to
draw
it
he
must
learn
of
him
who
draws
by
his
side
whoever
in
the
commonest
duties
that
fall
to
him
does
as
the
father
would
have
him
do
bears
his
yoke
along
with
jesus
and
the
father
takes
his
help
for
the
redemption
of
the
world
for
the
deliverance
of
men
from
the
slavery
of
their
own
waggons
into
the
liberty
of
god
husbandmen
bearing
the
same
yoke
with
jesus
the
man
learns
to
walk
step
for
step
with
him
drawing
drawing
the
cart
laden
with
the
will
of
the
father
of
both
and
rejoicing
with
the
joy
of
jesus
the
glory
of
existence
is
to
take
up
its
burden
and
exist
for
existence
eternal
and
supreme
for
the
father
who
does
his
divine
and
perfect
best
to
impart
his
glad
life
to
us
making
us
sharers
of
that
nature
which
is
bliss
and
that
labour
which
is
peace
he
lives
for
us
we
must
live
for
him
the
little
ones
must
take
their
full
share
in
the
great
work
his
work
is
the
business
of
the
family
starts
thy
soul
trembles
thy
brain
at
the
thought
of
such
a
burden
as
the
will
of
the
eternally
creating
eternally
saving
god
shall
mortal
man
walk
in
such
a
yoke
sayest
thou
with
the
son
of
god
bearing
it
also
why
brother
sister
it
is
the
only
burden
bearable
the
only
burden
that
can
be
borne
of
mortal
under
any
other
the
lightest
he
must
at
last
sink
outworn
his
very
soul
gray
with
sickness
he
on
whom
lay
the
other
half
of
the
burden
of
god
the
weight
of
his
creation
to
redeem
says
yoke
i
bear
is
easy
the
burden
i
draw
is
light
and
this
he
said
knowing
the
death
he
was
to
die
the
yoke
did
not
gall
his
neck
the
burden
did
not
overstrain
his
sinews
neither
did
the
goal
on
calvary
fright
him
from
the
straight
way
thither
he
had
the
will
of
the
father
to
work
out
and
that
will
was
his
strength
as
well
as
his
joy
he
had
the
same
will
as
his
father
to
him
the
one
thing
worth
living
for
was
the
share
the
love
of
his
father
gave
him
in
his
work
he
loved
his
father
even
to
the
death
of
the
cross
and
eternally
beyond
it
when
we
give
ourselves
up
to
the
father
as
the
son
gave
himself
we
shall
not
only
find
our
yoke
easy
and
our
burden
light
but
that
they
communicate
ease
and
lightness
not
only
will
they
not
make
us
weary
but
they
will
give
us
rest
from
all
other
weariness
let
us
not
waste
a
moment
in
asking
how
this
can
be
the
only
way
to
know
that
is
to
take
the
yoke
on
us
that
rest
is
a
secret
for
every
heart
to
know
for
never
a
tongue
to
tell
only
by
having
it
can
we
know
it
if
it
seem
impossible
to
take
the
yoke
on
us
let
us
attempt
the
impossible
let
us
lay
hold
of
the
yoke
and
bow
our
heads
and
try
to
get
our
necks
under
it
giving
our
father
the
opportunity
he
will
help
and
not
fail
us
he
is
helping
us
every
moment
when
least
we
think
we
need
his
help
when
most
we
think
we
do
then
may
we
most
boldly
as
most
earnestly
we
must
cry
for
it
what
or
how
much
his
creatures
can
do
or
bear
god
only
understands
but
when
most
it
seems
impossible
to
do
or
bear
we
must
be
most
confident
that
he
will
neither
demand
too
much
nor
fail
with
the
vital
that
help
will
be
there
when
wanted
that
is
the
moment
it
can
be
help
to
be
able
beforehand
to
imagine
ourselves
doing
or
bearing
we
have
neither
claim
nor
need
it
is
vain
to
think
that
any
weariness
however
caused
any
burden
however
slight
may
be
got
rid
of
otherwise
than
by
bowing
the
neck
to
the
yoke
of
the
father
will
there
can
be
no
other
rest
for
heart
and
soul
that
he
has
created
from
every
burden
from
every
anxiety
from
all
dread
of
shame
or
loss
even
loss
of
love
itself
that
yoke
will
set
us
free
these
words
of
the
lord
so
many
as
are
reported
in
common
by
st
matthew
and
st
luke
namely
his
thanksgiving
and
his
statement
concerning
the
mutual
knowledge
of
his
father
and
himself
meet
me
like
a
well
known
face
unexpectedly
encountered
they
come
to
me
like
a
piece
of
heavenly
bread
cut
from
the
gospel
of
st
john
the
words
are
not
in
that
gospel
and
in
st
matthew
and
st
luke
there
is
nothing
more
of
the
kind
in
st
mark
nothing
like
them
the
passage
seems
to
me
just
one
solitary
flower
testifying
to
the
presence
in
the
gospels
of
matthew
and
luke
of
the
same
root
of
thought
and
feeling
which
everywhere
blossoms
in
that
of
john
it
looks
as
if
it
had
crept
out
of
the
fourth
gospel
into
the
first
and
third
and
seems
a
true
sign
though
no
proof
that
however
much
the
fourth
be
unlike
the
other
gospels
they
have
all
the
same
origin
some
disciple
was
able
to
remember
one
such
word
of
which
the
promised
comforter
brought
many
to
the
remembrance
of
john
i
do
not
see
how
the
more
phenomenal
gospels
are
ever
to
be
understood
save
through
a
right
perception
of
the
relation
in
which
the
lord
stands
to
his
father
which
relation
is
the
main
subject
of
the
gospel
according
to
st
john
as
to
the
loving
cry
of
the
great
brother
to
the
whole
weary
world
which
matthew
alone
has
set
down
i
seem
aware
of
a
certain
indescribable
individuality
in
its
tone
distinguishing
it
from
all
his
other
sayings
on
record
those
who
come
at
the
call
of
the
lord
and
take
the
rest
he
offers
them
learning
of
him
and
bearing
the
yoke
of
the
father
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
the
light
of
the
world
salt
and
the
light
of
the
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
savour
wherewith
shall
it
be
salted
it
is
thenceforth
good
for
nothing
but
to
be
cast
out
and
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
men
ye
are
the
light
of
the
world
a
city
that
is
set
on
an
hill
can
not
be
hid
neither
do
men
light
a
candle
and
put
it
under
a
bushel
but
on
a
candlestick
and
it
giveth
light
unto
all
that
are
in
the
house
let
your
light
so
shine
before
men
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
lord
knew
these
men
and
had
their
hearts
in
his
hand
else
would
he
have
told
them
they
were
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
the
light
of
the
world
they
were
in
danger
it
is
true
of
pluming
themselves
on
what
he
had
said
of
them
of
taking
their
importance
to
their
own
credit
and
seeing
themselves
other
than
god
saw
them
yet
the
lord
does
not
hesitate
to
call
his
few
humble
disciples
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
every
century
since
has
borne
witness
that
such
indeed
they
were
that
he
spoke
of
them
but
the
simple
fact
where
would
the
world
be
now
but
for
their
salt
and
their
light
the
world
that
knows
neither
their
salt
nor
their
light
may
imagine
itself
now
at
least
greatly
retarded
by
the
survival
of
their
influences
but
such
as
have
chosen
aspiration
and
not
ambition
will
cry
but
for
those
men
whither
should
we
at
this
moment
be
bound
their
master
set
them
to
be
salt
against
corruption
and
light
against
darkness
and
our
souls
answer
and
say
lord
they
have
been
the
salt
they
have
been
the
light
of
the
world
no
sooner
has
he
used
the
symbol
of
the
salt
than
the
lord
proceeds
to
supplement
its
incompleteness
they
were
salt
which
must
remember
that
it
is
salt
which
must
live
salt
and
choose
salt
and
be
salt
for
the
whole
worth
of
salt
lies
in
its
being
salt
and
all
the
saltness
of
the
moral
salt
lies
in
the
will
to
be
salt
to
lose
its
saltness
then
is
to
cease
to
exist
save
as
a
vile
thing
whose
very
being
is
unjustifiable
what
is
to
be
done
with
saltless
salt
with
such
as
would
teach
religion
and
know
not
god
having
thus
carried
the
figure
as
far
as
it
will
serve
him
the
master
changes
it
for
another
which
he
can
carry
farther
for
salt
only
preserves
from
growing
bad
it
does
not
cause
anything
to
grow
better
his
disciples
are
the
salt
of
the
world
but
they
are
more
therefore
having
warned
the
human
salt
to
look
to
itself
that
it
be
indeed
salt
he
proceeds
are
the
light
of
the
world
a
city
a
candle
and
so
resumes
his
former
path
of
persuasion
and
enforcement
is
so
therefore
make
it
so
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
therefore
be
salt
are
the
light
of
the
world
therefore
shine
are
a
city
be
seen
upon
your
hill
are
the
lord
candles
let
no
bushels
cover
you
let
your
light
shine
every
disciple
of
the
lord
must
be
a
preacher
of
righteousness
cities
are
the
best
lighted
portions
of
the
world
and
perhaps
the
lord
meant
are
a
live
city
therefore
light
up
your
city
some
connection
of
the
city
with
light
seems
probably
in
his
thought
seeing
the
allusion
to
the
city
on
the
hill
comes
in
the
midst
of
what
he
says
about
light
in
relation
to
his
disciples
as
the
light
of
the
world
anyhow
the
city
is
the
best
circle
in
which
and
the
best
centre
from
which
to
diffuse
moral
light
a
man
brooding
in
the
desert
may
find
the
very
light
of
light
but
he
must
go
to
the
city
to
let
it
shine
from
the
general
idea
of
light
however
associated
with
the
city
as
visible
to
all
the
country
around
the
lord
turns
at
once
in
this
probably
fragmentary
representation
of
his
words
to
the
homelier
the
more
individual
and
personally
applicable
figure
of
the
lamp
do
men
light
a
lamp
and
put
it
under
a
bushel
but
on
a
lampstand
and
it
giveth
light
to
all
that
are
in
the
house
here
let
us
meditate
a
moment
for
what
is
a
lamp
or
a
man
lighted
for
them
that
need
light
therefore
for
all
a
candle
is
not
lighted
for
itself
neither
is
a
man
the
light
that
serves
self
only
is
no
true
light
its
one
virtue
is
that
it
will
soon
go
out
the
bushel
needs
to
be
lighted
but
not
by
being
put
over
the
lamp
the
man
own
soul
needs
to
be
lighted
but
light
for
itself
only
light
covered
by
the
bushel
is
darkness
whether
to
soul
or
bushel
light
unshared
is
darkness
to
be
light
indeed
it
must
shine
out
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
light
that
it
is
for
others
the
thing
is
true
of
the
spiritual
as
of
the
physical
light
of
the
truth
as
of
its
type
the
lights
of
the
world
are
live
lights
the
lamp
that
the
lord
kindles
is
a
lamp
that
can
will
to
shine
a
soul
that
must
shine
its
true
relation
to
the
spirits
around
it
to
god
and
its
fellows
is
its
light
then
only
does
it
fully
shine
when
its
love
which
is
its
light
shows
it
to
all
the
souls
within
its
scope
and
all
those
souls
to
each
other
and
so
does
its
part
to
bring
all
together
toward
one
in
the
darkness
each
soul
is
alone
in
the
light
the
souls
are
a
family
men
do
not
light
a
lamp
to
kill
it
with
a
bushel
but
to
set
it
on
a
stand
that
it
may
give
light
to
all
that
are
in
the
house
the
lord
seems
to
say
have
i
lighted
you
not
that
you
may
shine
for
yourselves
but
that
you
may
give
light
unto
all
i
have
set
you
like
a
city
on
a
hill
that
the
whole
earth
may
see
and
share
in
your
light
shine
therefore
so
shine
before
men
that
they
may
see
your
good
things
and
glorify
your
father
for
the
light
with
which
he
has
lighted
you
take
heed
to
your
light
that
it
be
such
that
it
so
shine
that
in
you
men
may
see
the
father
may
see
your
works
so
good
so
plainly
his
that
they
recognize
his
presence
in
you
and
thank
him
for
you
there
was
the
danger
always
of
the
shadow
of
the
clouding
the
lamp
the
father
had
lighted
and
the
moment
they
ceased
to
show
the
father
the
light
that
was
in
them
was
darkness
god
alone
is
the
light
and
our
light
is
the
shining
of
his
will
in
our
lives
if
our
light
shine
at
all
it
must
be
it
can
be
only
in
showing
the
father
nothing
is
light
that
does
not
bear
him
witness
the
man
that
sees
the
glory
of
god
would
turn
sick
at
the
thought
of
glorifying
his
own
self
whose
one
only
possible
glory
is
to
shine
with
the
glory
of
god
when
a
man
tries
to
shine
from
the
self
that
is
not
one
with
god
and
filled
with
his
light
he
is
but
making
ready
for
his
own
gathering
contempt
the
man
who
like
his
lord
seeks
not
his
own
but
the
will
of
him
who
sent
him
he
alone
shines
he
who
would
shine
in
the
praises
of
men
will
sooner
or
later
find
himself
but
a
left
broken
on
the
field
let
us
bestir
ourselves
then
to
keep
this
word
of
the
lord
and
to
this
end
inquire
how
we
are
to
let
our
light
shine
to
the
man
who
does
not
try
to
order
his
thoughts
and
feelings
and
judgments
after
the
will
of
the
father
i
have
nothing
to
say
he
can
have
no
light
to
let
shine
for
to
let
our
light
shine
is
to
see
that
in
every
even
the
smallest
thing
our
lives
and
actions
correspond
to
what
we
know
of
god
that
as
the
true
children
of
our
father
in
heaven
we
do
everything
as
he
would
have
us
do
it
need
i
say
that
to
let
our
light
shine
is
to
be
just
honourable
true
courteous
more
careful
over
the
claim
of
our
neighbour
than
our
own
as
knowing
ourselves
in
danger
of
overlooking
it
and
not
bound
to
insist
on
every
claim
of
our
own
the
man
who
takes
no
count
of
what
is
fair
friendly
pure
unselfish
lovely
gracious
where
is
his
claim
to
call
jesus
his
master
where
his
claim
to
christianity
what
saves
his
claim
from
being
merest
mockery
the
outshining
of
any
human
light
must
be
obedience
to
truth
recognized
as
such
our
first
show
of
light
as
the
lord
disciples
must
be
in
doing
the
things
he
tells
us
naturally
thus
we
declare
him
our
master
the
ruler
of
our
conduct
the
enlightener
of
our
souls
and
while
in
the
doing
of
his
will
a
man
is
learning
the
loveliness
of
righteousness
he
can
hardly
fail
to
let
some
light
shine
across
the
dust
of
his
failures
the
exhalations
from
his
faults
thus
will
his
disciples
shine
as
lights
in
the
world
holding
forth
the
word
of
life
to
shine
we
must
keep
in
his
light
sunning
our
souls
in
it
by
thinking
of
what
he
said
and
did
and
would
have
us
think
and
do
so
shall
we
drink
the
light
like
some
diamonds
keep
it
and
shine
in
the
dark
doing
his
will
men
will
see
in
us
that
we
count
the
world
his
hold
that
his
will
and
not
ours
must
be
done
in
it
our
very
faces
will
then
shine
with
the
hope
of
seeing
him
and
being
taken
home
where
he
is
only
let
us
remember
that
trying
to
look
what
we
ought
to
be
is
the
beginning
of
hypocrisy
if
we
do
indeed
expect
better
things
to
come
we
must
let
our
hope
appear
a
christian
who
looks
gloomy
at
the
mention
of
death
still
more
one
who
talks
of
his
friends
as
if
he
had
lost
them
turns
the
bushel
of
his
over
the
lamp
of
the
lord
light
death
is
but
our
visible
horizon
and
our
look
ought
always
to
be
focussed
beyond
it
we
should
never
talk
as
if
death
were
the
end
of
anything
to
let
our
light
shine
we
must
take
care
that
we
have
no
respect
for
riches
if
we
have
none
there
is
no
fear
of
our
showing
any
to
treat
the
poor
man
with
less
attention
or
cordiality
than
the
rich
is
to
show
ourselves
the
servants
of
mammon
in
like
manner
we
must
lay
no
value
on
the
praise
of
men
or
in
any
way
seek
it
we
must
honour
no
man
because
of
intellect
fame
or
success
we
must
not
shrink
in
fear
of
the
judgment
of
men
from
doing
openly
what
we
hold
right
or
at
all
acknowledge
as
a
what
calls
itself
society
or
harbour
the
least
anxiety
for
its
approval
in
business
the
custom
of
the
trade
must
be
understood
by
both
contracting
parties
else
it
can
have
no
place
either
as
law
or
excuse
with
the
disciple
of
jesus
the
man
to
whom
business
is
one
thing
and
religion
another
is
not
a
disciple
if
he
refuses
to
harmonize
them
by
making
his
business
religion
he
has
already
chosen
mammon
if
he
thinks
not
to
settle
the
question
it
is
settled
the
most
futile
of
all
human
endeavours
is
to
serve
god
and
mammon
the
man
who
makes
the
endeavour
betrays
his
master
in
the
temple
and
kisses
him
in
the
garden
takes
advantage
of
him
in
the
shop
and
offers
him
service
on
sunday
his
very
is
but
a
further
service
of
mammon
but
let
us
waste
no
strength
in
despising
such
men
let
us
rather
turn
the
light
upon
ourselves
are
we
not
in
some
way
denying
him
is
our
light
bearing
witness
is
it
shining
before
men
so
that
they
glorify
god
for
it
if
it
does
not
shine
it
is
darkness
in
the
darkness
which
a
man
takes
for
light
he
will
thrust
at
the
heart
of
the
lord
himself
he
who
goes
about
his
everyday
duty
as
the
work
the
father
has
given
him
to
do
is
he
who
lets
his
light
shine
but
such
a
man
will
not
be
content
with
this
he
must
yet
let
his
light
shine
whatever
makes
his
heart
glad
he
will
have
his
neighbour
share
the
body
is
a
lantern
it
must
not
be
a
dark
lantern
the
glowing
heart
must
show
in
the
shining
face
his
glad
thought
may
not
be
one
to
impart
to
his
neighbour
but
he
must
not
quench
the
vibration
of
its
gladness
ere
it
reach
him
what
shall
we
say
of
him
who
comes
from
his
closet
his
with
such
a
veil
over
his
face
as
masks
his
very
humanity
is
it
with
the
father
that
man
has
had
communion
whose
every
movement
is
and
in
whose
eyes
dwell
no
smiles
for
the
people
of
his
house
the
man
who
receives
the
quiet
attentions
the
divine
ministrations
of
wife
or
son
or
daughter
without
token
of
pleasure
without
sign
of
gratitude
can
hardly
have
been
with
jesus
or
can
he
have
been
with
him
and
have
left
him
behind
in
his
closet
if
his
faith
in
god
take
from
a
man
his
cheerfulness
how
shall
the
face
of
a
man
ever
shine
and
why
are
they
always
glad
before
the
face
of
the
father
in
heaven
it
is
true
that
pain
or
inward
grief
may
blameless
banish
all
smiling
but
even
heaviness
of
heart
has
no
right
so
to
tumble
the
bushel
over
the
lamp
that
no
ray
can
get
out
to
tell
that
love
is
yet
burning
within
the
man
must
at
least
let
his
dear
ones
know
that
something
else
than
displeasure
with
them
is
the
cause
of
his
clouded
countenance
what
a
sweet
colour
the
divine
light
takes
to
itself
in
courtesy
whose
perfection
is
the
recognition
of
every
man
as
a
temple
of
the
living
god
sorely
ruined
sadly
defiled
the
temple
may
be
but
if
god
had
left
it
it
would
be
a
heap
and
not
a
house
next
to
love
specially
will
the
light
shine
out
in
fairness
what
light
can
he
have
in
him
who
is
always
on
his
own
side
and
will
never
descry
reason
or
right
on
that
of
his
adversary
and
certainly
if
he
that
showeth
mercy
as
well
he
that
showeth
justice
ought
to
do
it
with
cheerfulness
but
if
all
our
light
shine
out
and
none
of
our
darkness
shall
we
not
be
in
utmost
danger
of
hypocrisy
yes
if
we
but
hide
our
darkness
and
do
not
strive
to
slay
it
with
our
light
what
way
have
we
to
show
it
while
struggling
to
destroy
it
only
when
we
cherish
evil
is
there
hypocrisy
in
hiding
it
a
man
who
is
honestly
fighting
it
and
showing
it
no
quarter
is
already
conqueror
in
christ
or
will
soon
be
and
more
than
innocent
but
our
good
feelings
those
that
make
for
righteousness
and
unity
we
ought
to
let
shine
they
claim
to
commune
with
the
light
in
others
many
parents
hold
words
unsaid
which
would
lift
from
the
hearts
of
their
children
yea
make
them
leap
for
joy
a
stern
father
and
a
silent
mother
make
mournful
or
which
is
far
worse
hard
children
need
i
add
that
if
any
one
hearing
the
injunction
to
let
his
light
shine
makes
himself
shine
instead
it
is
because
the
light
is
not
in
him
but
what
shall
i
say
of
such
as
in
the
name
of
religion
let
only
their
darkness
out
the
darkness
of
worshipped
opinion
the
darkness
of
and
disobedience
such
are
those
who
tear
asunder
the
body
of
christ
with
the
explosives
of
dispute
on
the
plea
of
such
a
unity
as
alone
they
can
understand
namely
a
paltry
uniformity
what
have
not
the
and
the
dissenter
to
answer
for
who
hiding
what
true
light
they
have
if
indeed
they
have
any
each
under
the
bushel
of
his
radiate
only
repulsion
there
is
no
schism
none
whatever
in
using
diverse
forms
of
thought
or
worship
true
honesty
is
never
schismatic
the
real
schismatic
is
the
man
who
turns
away
love
and
justice
from
the
neighbour
who
holds
theories
in
religious
philosophy
or
as
to
different
from
his
own
who
denies
or
avoids
his
brother
because
he
follows
not
with
him
who
calls
him
a
schismatic
because
he
prefers
this
or
that
mode
of
public
worship
not
his
the
other
be
schismatic
he
himself
certainly
he
walks
in
the
darkness
of
opinion
not
in
the
light
of
life
not
in
the
faith
which
worketh
by
love
worst
of
all
is
division
in
the
name
of
christ
who
came
to
make
one
neither
paul
nor
apollos
nor
cephas
would
least
of
all
will
christ
be
the
leader
of
any
party
save
that
of
his
own
elect
the
party
of
love
of
love
which
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
which
envieth
not
is
not
puffed
up
doth
not
behave
itself
unseemly
seeketh
not
its
own
is
not
easily
provoked
thinketh
no
evil
rejoiceth
not
in
iniquity
but
rejoiceth
in
the
truth
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
your
light
shine
says
the
lord
if
i
have
none
the
call
can
not
apply
to
me
but
i
must
bethink
me
lest
in
the
night
i
am
cherishing
about
me
the
lord
come
upon
me
like
a
thief
there
may
be
those
however
and
i
think
they
are
numerous
who
having
some
or
imagining
they
have
much
light
yet
have
not
enough
to
know
the
duty
of
letting
it
shine
on
their
neighbours
the
lord
would
have
his
men
so
alive
with
his
light
that
it
should
for
ever
go
flashing
from
each
to
all
and
all
with
eternal
response
keep
glorifying
the
father
dost
thou
look
for
a
good
time
coming
friend
when
thou
shalt
know
as
thou
art
known
let
the
joy
of
thy
hope
stream
forth
upon
thy
neighbours
fold
them
round
in
that
which
maketh
thyself
glad
let
thy
nature
grow
more
expansive
and
communicative
look
like
the
man
thou
art
a
man
who
knows
something
very
good
thou
believest
thyself
on
the
way
to
the
heart
of
things
walk
so
shine
so
that
all
that
see
thee
shall
want
to
go
with
thee
what
light
issues
from
such
as
make
their
faces
long
at
the
very
name
of
death
and
look
and
speak
as
if
it
were
the
end
of
all
things
and
the
worst
of
evils
jesus
told
his
men
not
to
fear
death
told
them
his
friends
should
go
to
be
with
him
told
them
they
should
live
in
the
house
of
his
father
and
their
father
and
since
then
he
has
risen
himself
from
the
tomb
and
gone
to
prepare
a
place
for
them
who
what
are
these
miserable
refusers
of
comfort
not
christians
surely
oh
yes
they
are
christians
are
gone
they
say
be
for
ever
with
the
lord
and
then
they
weep
and
lament
and
seem
more
afraid
of
starting
to
join
them
than
of
aught
else
under
the
sun
to
the
last
attainable
moment
they
cling
to
what
they
call
life
they
are
children
were
there
ever
any
other
such
children
who
hang
crying
to
the
skirts
of
their
mother
and
will
not
be
lifted
to
her
bosom
they
are
not
of
paul
mind
to
be
with
him
is
not
better
they
worship
their
physician
and
their
prayer
to
the
god
of
their
life
is
to
spare
them
from
more
life
what
sort
of
christians
are
they
where
shines
their
light
alas
for
thee
poor
world
hadst
thou
no
better
lights
than
these
you
who
have
light
show
yourselves
the
sons
and
daughters
of
light
of
god
of
hope
the
heirs
of
a
great
completeness
freely
let
your
light
shine
only
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
righteousness
before
men
to
be
seen
of
them
right
hand
and
the
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
righteousness
before
men
to
be
seen
of
them
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
but
when
thou
doest
alms
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth
that
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
himself
shall
reward
vi
let
your
light
out
freely
that
men
may
see
it
but
not
that
men
may
see
you
if
i
do
anything
not
because
it
has
to
be
done
not
because
god
would
have
it
so
not
that
i
may
do
right
not
because
it
is
honest
not
that
i
love
the
thing
not
that
i
may
be
true
to
my
lord
not
that
the
truth
may
be
recognized
as
truth
and
as
his
but
that
i
may
be
seen
as
the
doer
that
i
may
be
praised
of
men
that
i
may
gain
repute
or
fame
be
the
thing
itself
ever
so
good
i
may
look
to
men
for
my
reward
for
there
is
none
for
me
with
the
father
if
that
light
being
my
pleasure
i
do
it
that
the
light
may
shine
and
that
men
may
know
light
the
father
of
lights
i
do
well
but
if
i
do
it
that
i
may
be
seen
shining
that
the
light
may
be
noted
as
emanating
from
me
and
not
from
another
then
am
i
of
those
that
seek
glory
of
men
and
worship
satan
the
light
that
through
me
may
possibly
illuminate
others
will
in
me
and
for
me
be
darkness
when
thou
doest
alms
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
how
then
am
i
to
let
my
light
shine
if
i
take
pains
to
hide
what
i
do
the
injunction
is
not
to
hide
what
you
do
from
others
but
to
hide
it
from
yourself
the
master
would
have
you
not
plume
yourself
upon
it
not
cherish
the
thought
that
you
have
done
it
or
confer
with
yourself
in
satisfaction
over
it
you
must
not
count
it
to
your
praise
a
man
must
not
desire
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
his
right
hand
must
not
seek
the
praise
of
his
left
hand
his
doing
must
not
invite
his
the
right
hand
must
let
the
thing
done
go
as
a
thing
we
must
meditate
nothing
either
as
a
fine
thing
for
us
to
do
or
a
fine
thing
for
us
to
have
done
we
must
not
imagine
any
merit
in
us
it
would
be
to
love
a
lie
for
we
can
have
none
there
is
no
such
thing
possible
is
there
anything
to
be
proud
of
in
refusing
to
worship
the
devil
is
it
a
grand
thing
is
it
a
meritorious
thing
not
to
be
vile
when
we
have
done
all
we
are
unprofitable
servants
our
very
best
is
but
decent
what
more
could
it
be
why
then
think
of
it
as
anything
more
what
things
could
we
or
any
one
do
worthy
of
being
brooded
over
as
possessions
good
to
do
they
were
bad
to
pride
ourselves
upon
they
are
why
should
a
man
meditate
with
satisfaction
on
having
denied
himself
some
selfish
indulgence
any
more
than
on
having
washed
his
hands
may
we
roll
the
rejection
of
a
villainy
as
a
sweet
morsel
under
our
tongues
they
were
the
worst
villains
of
all
who
could
be
proud
of
not
having
committed
a
villainy
and
their
pride
would
but
render
them
the
more
capable
of
the
villainy
when
next
the
temptation
to
it
came
even
if
our
supposed
merit
were
of
the
positive
order
and
we
did
every
duty
perfectly
the
moment
we
began
to
pride
ourselves
upon
the
fact
we
should
drop
into
a
hell
of
worthlessness
what
are
we
for
but
to
do
our
duty
we
must
do
it
and
think
nothing
of
ourselves
for
that
neither
care
what
men
think
of
us
for
anything
with
the
praise
or
blame
of
men
we
have
nought
to
do
their
blame
may
be
a
good
thing
their
praise
can
not
be
but
the
worst
sort
of
the
praise
of
men
is
the
praise
we
give
ourselves
we
must
do
nothing
to
be
seen
of
ourselves
we
must
seek
no
approbation
even
but
that
of
god
else
we
shut
the
door
of
the
kingdom
from
the
outside
his
approbation
will
but
quicken
our
sense
of
unworthiness
what
seek
the
praise
of
men
for
being
fair
to
our
own
brothers
and
sisters
what
seek
the
praise
of
god
for
laying
our
hearts
at
the
feet
of
him
to
whom
we
utterly
belong
there
is
no
pride
so
mean
and
all
pride
is
absolutely
essentially
mean
as
the
pride
of
being
holier
than
our
fellow
except
the
pride
of
being
holy
such
imagined
holiness
is
foulness
religion
itself
in
the
hearts
of
the
unreal
is
a
dead
thing
what
seems
life
in
it
is
the
vermiculate
life
of
a
corpse
there
is
one
word
in
the
context
as
we
have
it
in
the
authorized
version
that
used
to
trouble
me
seeming
to
make
its
publicity
a
portion
of
the
reward
for
doing
certain
right
things
in
secret
i
mean
the
word
at
the
ends
of
the
fourth
the
sixth
and
the
eighteenth
verses
making
the
lord
seem
to
say
the
praise
of
men
and
thou
shalt
at
length
have
the
praise
of
men
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly
reward
shall
be
seen
of
men
and
thou
seen
as
the
receiver
of
the
reward
in
what
other
way
could
the
word
then
or
now
be
fairly
understood
it
must
be
the
interpolation
of
some
jew
scribe
who
even
after
learning
a
little
of
the
christ
continued
unable
to
conceive
as
reward
anything
that
did
not
draw
part
at
least
of
its
sweetness
from
the
gazing
eyes
of
the
multitude
glad
was
i
to
find
that
the
word
is
not
in
the
best
manuscripts
and
god
be
thanked
that
it
is
left
out
in
the
revised
version
what
shall
we
think
of
the
daring
that
could
interpolate
it
but
of
like
sort
is
the
daring
of
much
exposition
of
the
master
words
what
men
have
not
faith
enough
to
receive
they
will
still
dilute
to
the
standard
of
their
own
faculty
of
reception
if
any
one
say
did
the
lord
let
the
word
remain
there
so
long
if
he
never
said
it
i
answer
perhaps
that
the
minds
of
his
disciples
might
be
troubled
at
its
presence
arise
against
it
and
do
him
right
by
casting
it
out
and
so
wisdom
be
justified
of
her
children
but
there
are
some
who
if
the
notion
of
reward
is
not
naturally
a
trouble
to
them
yet
have
come
to
feel
it
such
because
of
the
words
of
certain
objectors
who
think
to
take
a
higher
stand
than
the
christian
saying
the
idea
of
reward
for
doing
right
is
a
low
an
unworthy
idea
now
verily
it
would
be
a
low
thing
for
any
child
to
do
his
will
in
the
hope
that
his
father
would
reward
him
for
it
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
for
a
father
whose
child
endeavours
to
please
him
to
let
him
know
that
he
recognizes
his
childness
toward
him
and
will
be
fatherly
good
to
him
what
kind
of
a
father
were
the
man
who
because
there
could
be
no
merit
or
desert
in
doing
well
would
not
give
his
child
a
smile
or
a
pleased
word
when
he
saw
him
trying
his
best
would
not
such
acknowledgment
from
the
father
be
the
natural
correlate
of
the
child
behaviour
and
what
would
the
father
smile
be
but
the
perfect
reward
of
the
child
suppose
the
father
to
love
the
child
so
that
he
wants
to
give
him
everything
but
dares
not
until
his
character
is
developed
must
he
not
be
glad
and
show
his
gladness
at
every
shade
of
a
progress
that
will
at
length
set
him
free
to
throne
his
son
over
all
that
he
has
am
an
unprofitable
servant
says
the
man
who
has
done
his
duty
but
his
lord
coming
unexpectedly
and
finding
him
at
his
post
girds
himself
and
makes
him
sit
down
to
meat
and
comes
forth
and
serves
him
how
could
the
divine
order
of
things
founded
for
growth
and
gradual
betterment
hold
and
proceed
without
the
notion
of
return
for
a
thing
done
must
there
be
only
current
and
no
tide
how
can
we
be
workers
with
god
at
his
work
and
he
never
say
you
my
child
will
he
take
joy
in
his
success
and
give
none
is
he
the
husbandman
to
take
all
the
profit
and
muzzle
the
mouth
of
his
ox
when
a
man
does
work
for
another
he
has
his
wages
for
it
and
society
exists
by
the
dependence
of
man
upon
man
through
work
and
wages
the
devil
is
not
the
inventor
of
this
society
he
has
invented
the
notion
of
a
certain
degradation
in
work
a
still
greater
in
wages
and
following
this
up
has
constituted
a
society
after
his
own
likeness
which
despises
work
leaves
it
undone
and
so
can
claim
its
wages
without
disgrace
if
you
say
one
ought
to
do
right
for
the
sake
of
reward
i
go
farther
and
say
man
do
right
for
the
sake
of
reward
a
man
may
do
a
thing
indifferent
he
may
do
a
thing
wrong
for
the
sake
of
reward
but
a
thing
in
itself
right
done
for
reward
would
in
the
very
doing
cease
to
be
right
at
the
same
time
if
a
man
does
right
he
can
not
escape
being
rewarded
for
it
and
to
refuse
the
reward
would
be
to
refuse
life
and
foil
the
creative
love
the
whole
question
is
of
the
kind
of
reward
expected
what
first
reward
for
doing
well
may
i
look
for
to
grow
purer
in
heart
and
stronger
in
the
hope
of
at
length
seeing
god
if
a
man
be
not
after
this
fashion
rewarded
he
must
perish
as
to
happiness
or
any
lower
rewards
that
naturally
follow
the
first
is
god
to
destroy
the
law
of
his
universe
the
divine
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
in
order
to
say
must
do
well
but
you
shall
gain
no
good
by
it
you
must
lead
a
dull
joyless
existence
to
all
eternity
that
lack
of
delight
may
show
you
pure
could
love
create
with
such
end
in
view
righteousness
does
not
demand
creation
it
is
love
not
righteousness
that
can
not
live
alone
the
creature
must
already
be
ere
righteousness
can
put
in
a
claim
but
hearts
and
souls
there
love
itself
which
created
for
love
and
joy
presses
the
demand
of
righteousness
first
a
righteousness
that
created
misery
in
order
to
itself
would
be
a
righteousness
that
was
unrighteous
god
will
die
for
righteousness
but
never
create
for
a
joyless
righteousness
to
call
into
being
the
necessarily
and
hopelessly
incomplete
would
be
to
wrong
creation
in
its
very
essence
to
create
for
the
knowledge
of
himself
and
then
not
give
himself
would
be
injustice
even
to
cruelty
and
if
god
give
himself
what
other
reward
there
can
be
no
is
not
included
seeing
he
is
life
and
all
her
children
the
all
in
all
it
will
take
the
utmost
joy
god
can
give
to
let
men
know
him
and
what
man
knowing
him
would
mind
losing
every
other
joy
only
what
other
joy
could
keep
from
entering
where
the
god
of
joy
already
dwelt
the
law
of
the
universe
holds
and
will
hold
the
name
of
the
father
be
praised
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
have
sown
the
wind
and
they
shall
reap
the
whirlwind
that
soweth
to
his
flesh
shall
of
the
flesh
reap
corruption
but
he
that
soweth
to
the
spirit
shall
of
the
spirit
reap
life
everlasting
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
and
he
shall
have
more
abundance
but
whosoever
hath
not
from
him
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
he
hath
to
object
to
christianity
as
selfish
is
utter
foolishness
christianity
alone
gives
any
hope
of
deliverance
from
selfishness
is
it
selfish
to
desire
to
love
is
it
selfish
to
hope
for
purity
and
the
sight
of
god
what
better
can
we
do
for
our
neighbour
than
to
become
altogether
righteous
toward
him
will
he
not
be
the
nearer
sharing
in
the
exceeding
great
reward
of
a
return
to
the
divine
idea
where
is
the
evil
toward
god
where
the
wrong
to
my
neighbour
if
i
think
sometimes
of
the
joys
to
follow
in
the
train
of
perfect
loving
is
not
the
atmosphere
of
god
love
itself
the
very
breath
of
the
father
wherein
can
float
no
thinnest
pollution
of
selfishness
the
only
material
wherewithal
to
build
the
airy
castles
of
heaven
the
childlike
heart
might
cry
me
all
the
wages
all
the
reward
thy
perfect
can
give
thy
unmeriting
child
my
fit
wages
may
be
pain
sorrow
humiliation
of
soul
i
stretch
out
my
hands
to
receive
them
thy
reward
will
be
to
lift
me
out
of
the
mire
of
and
bring
me
nearer
to
thyself
and
thy
children
welcome
divinest
of
good
things
thy
highest
reward
is
thy
purest
gift
thou
didst
make
me
for
it
from
the
first
thou
the
eternal
life
hast
been
labouring
still
to
fit
me
for
receiving
it
the
vision
the
knowledge
the
possession
of
thyself
i
can
seek
but
what
thou
waitest
and
watchest
to
give
i
would
be
such
into
whom
thy
love
can
flow
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
merit
that
could
live
before
god
is
the
merit
of
jesus
who
of
himself
at
once
untaught
unimplored
laid
himself
aside
and
turned
to
the
father
refusing
his
life
save
in
the
father
like
god
of
himself
he
chose
righteousness
and
so
merited
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
god
in
the
same
spirit
he
gave
himself
afterward
to
his
father
children
and
merited
the
power
to
transfuse
the
energy
of
his
spirit
into
theirs
made
perfect
he
became
the
author
of
eternal
salvation
unto
all
them
that
obey
him
but
it
is
a
word
of
little
daring
that
jesus
had
no
thought
of
merit
in
what
he
did
that
he
saw
only
what
he
had
to
be
what
he
must
i
speak
after
the
poor
fashion
of
a
man
lost
in
what
is
too
great
for
him
yet
is
his
very
where
can
be
a
man
merit
in
refusing
to
go
down
to
an
abyss
of
loss
loss
of
the
right
to
be
loss
of
his
father
loss
of
himself
would
satan
with
all
the
instincts
and
impulses
of
his
origin
in
him
have
eternal
life
by
refusing
to
be
a
devil
not
the
less
would
he
have
had
eternal
life
not
the
less
would
he
have
been
wrapt
in
the
love
and
confidence
of
the
father
he
would
have
had
his
reward
i
can
not
imagine
thing
created
meriting
aught
save
by
divine
courtesy
i
suspect
the
notion
of
merit
belongs
to
a
low
development
and
the
higher
a
man
rises
the
less
will
he
find
it
worth
a
thought
perhaps
we
shall
come
to
see
that
it
owes
what
being
it
has
to
man
that
it
is
a
thing
thinkable
only
by
man
i
suspect
it
is
not
a
thought
of
the
eternal
mind
and
has
in
itself
no
existence
being
to
god
merely
a
thing
thought
by
man
for
merit
lives
from
man
to
man
and
not
from
man
o
lord
to
thee
the
man
then
who
does
right
and
seeks
no
praise
from
men
while
he
merits
nothing
shall
be
rewarded
by
his
father
and
his
reward
will
be
right
precious
to
him
we
must
let
our
light
shine
make
our
faith
our
hope
our
love
manifest
that
men
may
praise
not
us
for
shining
but
the
father
for
creating
the
light
no
man
with
faith
hope
love
alive
in
his
soul
could
make
the
divine
possessions
a
show
to
gain
for
himself
the
admiration
of
men
not
the
less
must
they
appear
in
our
words
in
our
looks
in
our
carriage
above
all
in
honourable
unselfish
hospitable
helpful
deeds
our
light
must
shine
in
cheerfulness
in
joy
yea
where
a
man
has
the
gift
in
merriment
in
freedom
from
care
save
for
one
another
in
interest
in
the
things
of
others
in
fearlessness
and
tenderness
in
courtesy
and
graciousness
in
our
anger
and
indignation
specially
must
our
light
shine
but
we
must
give
no
quarter
to
the
most
shadowy
thought
of
how
this
or
that
will
look
from
the
faintest
thought
of
the
praise
of
men
we
must
turn
away
no
man
can
be
the
disciple
of
christ
and
desire
fame
to
desire
fame
is
ignoble
it
is
a
beggarly
greed
in
the
noble
mind
it
is
the
more
of
an
infirmity
there
is
no
aspiration
in
it
nothing
but
ambition
it
is
simply
selfishness
that
would
be
proud
if
it
could
fame
is
the
applause
of
the
many
and
the
judgment
of
the
many
is
foolish
therefore
the
greater
the
fame
the
more
is
the
foolishness
that
swells
it
and
the
worse
is
the
foolishness
that
longs
after
it
aspiration
is
the
sole
escape
from
ambition
he
who
aspires
that
is
does
his
endeavour
to
rise
above
himself
neither
lusts
to
be
higher
than
his
neighbour
nor
seeks
to
mount
in
his
opinion
what
light
there
is
in
him
shines
the
more
that
he
does
nothing
to
be
seen
of
men
he
stands
in
the
mist
between
the
gulf
and
the
glory
and
looks
upward
he
loves
not
his
own
soul
but
longs
to
be
clean
out
of
the
gulf
into
the
glory
father
my
soul
cries
out
to
be
lifted

the

dismal

the
shameful

let
us
try
through
these
words
to
get
at
the
idea
in
st
paul
mind
for
which
they
stand
and
have
so
long
stood
it
can
be
no
worthless
idea
they
represent
no
mere
platitude
which
a
man
failing
to
understand
it
at
once
may
without
loss
leave
behind
him
the
words
mean
something
which
paul
believes
vitally
associated
with
the
life
and
death
of
his
master
he
had
seen
jesus
with
his
bodily
eyes
i
think
but
he
had
not
seen
him
with
those
alone
he
had
seen
and
saw
him
with
the
real
eyes
the
eyes
that
do
not
see
except
they
understand
and
the
sight
of
him
had
uplifted
his
whole
nature
first
his
pure
will
for
righteousness
and
then
his
hoping
imagination
and
out
of
these
in
the
knowledge
of
jesus
he
spoke
the
letters
he
has
left
behind
him
written
in
the
power
of
this
uplifting
have
waked
but
poor
ideas
in
poor
minds
for
words
if
they
seem
to
mean
anything
must
always
seem
to
mean
something
within
the
scope
of
the
mind
hearing
them
words
can
not
convey
the
thought
of
a
thinker
to
a
of
a
largely
aspiring
and
soul
to
a
creature
satisfied
with
his
poverty
and
counting
his
meagre
faculty
the
human
standard
neither
will
they
readily
reveal
the
mind
of
one
old
in
thought
to
one
who
has
but
lately
begun
to
think
the
higher
the
reader
notion
of
what
st
paul
intends
the
higher
the
idea
that
is
which
his
words
wake
in
him
the
more
likely
is
it
to
be
the
same
which
moved
the
man
who
had
seen
jesus
and
was
his
own
no
more
if
a
man
err
in
his
interpretation
it
will
hardly
be
by
attributing
to
his
words
an
intent
too
high
first
then
what
does
paul
the
slave
of
christ
intend
by
creature
or
creation
if
he
means
the
he
did
not
surely
and
without
saying
so
mean
to
exclude
the
noblest
part
of
it
the
sentient
if
he
did
it
is
doubly
strange
that
he
should
immediately
attribute
not
merely
sense
but
conscious
sense
to
that
part
the
insentient
namely
which
remained
if
you
say
he
does
so
but
by
a
figure
of
speech
i
answer
that
a
figure
that
meant
less
than
it
said
and
how
much
less
would
not
this
would
be
one
altogether
unworthy
of
the
lord
messenger
first
i
repeat
to
exclude
the
sentient
from
the
term
common
to
both
in
the
word
or
and
then
to
attribute
the
capabilities
of
the
sentient
to
the
insentient
as
a
mere
figure
to
express
the
hopes
of
men
with
regard
to
the
perfecting
of
the
insentient
for
the
comfort
of
men
were
a
violence
as
unfit
in
rhetoric
as
in
its
own
nature
take
another
part
of
the
same
utterance
we
know
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
together
until
now
is
it
not
manifest
that
to
interpret
such
words
as
referring
to
the
mere
imperfections
of
the
insensate
material
world
would
be
to
make
of
the
phrase
a
worthless
hyperbole
i
am
inclined
to
believe
the
apostle
regarded
the
whole
visible
creation
as
in
far
differing
degrees
of
consciousness
a
live
outcome
from
the
heart
of
the
living
one
who
is
all
and
in
all
such
view
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
care
to
insist
upon
i
only
care
to
argue
that
the
word
or
must
include
everything
in
creation
that
has
sentient
life
that
i
should
in
the
class
include
a
greater
number
of
phenomena
than
a
reader
may
be
prepared
to
admit
will
nowise
affect
the
force
of
what
i
have
to
say
seeing
my
point
is
simply
this
that
in
the
term
paul
comprises
all
creatures
capable
of
suffering
the
condition
of
which
sentient
therefore
superior
portion
gives
him
occasion
to
speak
of
the
whole
creation
as
suffering
in
the
process
of
its
divine
evolution
or
development
groaning
and
travailing
as
in
the
pangs
of
giving
birth
to
a
better
self
a
nobler
world
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
idea
that
the
creation
should
know
what
it
is
groaning
after
or
wherein
the
higher
condition
constituting
its
deliverance
must
consist
the
human
race
groans
for
deliverance
how
much
does
the
race
know
that
its
redemption
lies
in
becoming
one
with
the
father
and
partaking
of
his
glory
here
and
there
one
of
the
race
knows
it
which
is
indeed
a
pledge
for
the
race
but
the
race
can
not
be
said
to
know
its
own
lack
or
to
have
even
a
notion
of
what
alone
can
stay
its
groaning
in
like
manner
the
whole
creation
is
groaning
after
an
unforeseen
yet
essential
birth
groans
with
the
necessity
of
being
freed
from
a
state
that
is
but
a
transitional
and
not
a
true
one
from
a
condition
that
nowise
answers
to
the
intent
in
which
existence
began
in
both
the
lower
creation
and
the
higher
this
same
groaning
of
the
fettered
idea
after
a
freer
life
seems
the
first
enforced
decree
of
a
holy
fate
and
itself
the
first
movement
of
the
hampered
thing
toward
the
liberty
of
another
birth
to
believe
that
god
made
many
of
the
lower
creatures
merely
for
prey
or
to
be
the
slaves
of
a
slave
and
writhe
under
the
tyrannies
of
a
cruel
master
who
will
not
serve
his
own
master
that
he
created
and
is
creating
an
endless
succession
of
them
to
reap
little
or
no
good
of
life
but
its
cessation
a
doctrine
held
by
some
and
practically
accepted
by
multitudes
is
to
believe
in
a
god
who
so
far
as
one
portion
at
least
of
his
creation
is
concerned
is
a
demon
but
a
creative
demon
is
an
absurdity
and
were
such
a
creator
possible
he
would
not
be
god
but
must
one
day
be
found
and
destroyed
by
the
real
god
not
the
less
the
fact
remains
that
miserable
suffering
abounds
among
them
and
that
even
supposing
god
did
not
foresee
how
creation
would
turn
out
for
them
the
thing
lies
at
his
door
he
has
besides
made
them
so
far
dumb
that
they
can
not
move
the
hearts
of
the
oppressors
into
whose
hands
he
has
given
them
telling
how
hard
they
find
the
world
how
sore
their
life
in
it
the
apostle
takes
up
their
case
and
gives
us
material
for
an
answer
to
such
as
blame
god
for
their
sad
condition
there
are
many
i
suspect
who
from
the
eighth
chapter
of
st
epistle
to
the
romans
gather
this
much
and
no
more
that
the
lower
animals
alive
at
the
coming
of
the
lord
whensoever
that
may
be
will
thenceforward
with
such
as
thereafter
may
come
into
existence
lead
a
happy
life
for
the
time
allotted
them
strong
champions
of
god
these
profound
believers
what
lovers
of
life
what
disciples
of
st
paul
nay
what
disciples
of
jesus
to
whom
such
a
gloss
is
consolation
for
the
moans
of
a
universe
truly
the
furnace
of
affliction
they
would
extinguish
thus
casts
out
the
more
an
evil
odour
for
all
the
creatures
who
through
ages
of
misery
have
groaned
and
travailed
and
died
to
these
mild
christians
it
is
enough
that
they
are
dead
therefore
as
they
would
argue
out
of
it
now
is
well
with
them
i
seem
to
hear
such
say
are
mercifully
dealt
with
their
sufferings
are
over
they
had
not
to
live
on
for
ever
in
oppression
the
god
of
their
life
has
taken
from
them
their
past
and
troubles
them
with
no
future
it
is
true
this
were
no
small
consolation
concerning
such
as
are
gone
away
surely
rest
is
better
than
ceaseless
toil
and
pain
but
what
shall
we
say
of
such
a
heedless
god
as
those
christians
are
content
to
worship
is
he
a
merciful
god
is
he
a
loving
god
how
shall
he
die
to
escape
the
remorse
of
the
authorship
of
so
much
misery
our
pity
turns
from
the
dead
creature
to
the
live
creator
who
could
live
and
know
himself
the
maker
of
so
many
extinguished
hearts
whose
friend
was
not
he
but
death
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
father
of
jesus
there
is
no
such
creator
be
we
have
not
to
do
with
the
dead
only
there
are
those
which
live
and
suffer
is
there
no
comfort
concerning
them
but
that
they
too
shall
at
length
die
and
leave
their
misery
and
what
shall
we
say
of
those
coming
and
yet
to
come
and
pass
evermore
issuing
from
the
fountain
of
life
daily
born
into
evil
things
will
the
consolation
that
they
will
soon
die
suffice
for
the
heart
of
the
child
who
laments
over
his
dead
bird
or
rabbit
and
would
fain
love
that
father
in
heaven
who
keeps
on
making
the
creatures
alas
they
are
crowding
in
they
can
not
help
themselves
their
misery
is
awaiting
them
would
those
christians
have
me
believe
in
a
god
who
differentiates
creatures
from
himself
only
that
they
may
be
the
prey
of
other
creatures
or
spend
a
few
hours
or
years
helpless
and
lonely
speechless
and
without
appeal
in
merciless
hands
then
pass
away
into
nothingness
i
will
not
in
the
name
of
jesus
i
will
not
had
he
not
known
something
better
would
he
have
said
what
he
did
about
the
father
of
men
and
the
sparrows
what
many
men
call
their
beliefs
are
but
the
prejudices
they
happen
to
have
picked
up
why
should
such
believers
waste
a
thought
as
to
how
their
paltry
of
the
planet
fare
many
indeed
have
all
their
lives
been
too
busy
making
their
human
fellows
groan
and
sweat
for
their
own
fancied
to
spare
a
thought
for
the
fate
of
the
yet
more
helpless
but
there
are
not
a
few
who
would
be
indignant
at
having
their
belief
in
god
questioned
who
yet
seem
greatly
to
fear
imagining
him
better
than
he
is
whether
is
it
he
or
themselves
they
dread
injuring
by
expecting
too
much
of
him
see
the
plain
facts
of
the
case
they
say
is
no
questioning
them
what
can
be
done
for
the
poor
things
except
indeed
you
take
the
absurd
notion
into
your
head
that
they
too
have
a
life
beyond
the
grave
why
should
such
a
notion
seem
to
you
absurd
i
answer
the
teachers
of
the
nation
have
unwittingly
it
seems
to
me
through
unbelief
wronged
the
animals
deeply
by
their
silence
anent
the
thoughtless
popular
presumption
that
they
have
no
hereafter
thus
leaving
them
deprived
of
a
great
advantage
to
their
position
among
men
but
i
suppose
they
too
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
preserver
of
man
and
beast
never
had
a
thought
of
keeping
one
beast
alive
beyond
a
certain
time
in
which
case
heartless
men
might
well
argue
he
did
not
care
how
they
wronged
them
for
he
meant
them
no
redress
their
immortality
is
no
new
faith
with
me
but
as
old
as
my
childhood
do
you
believe
in
immortality
for
yourself
i
would
ask
any
reader
who
is
not
in
sympathy
with
my
hope
for
the
animals
if
not
i
have
no
argument
with
you
but
if
you
do
why
not
believe
in
it
for
them
verily
were
immortality
no
greater
a
thing
for
the
animals
than
it
seems
for
men
to
some
who
yet
profess
to
expect
it
i
should
scarce
care
to
insist
upon
their
share
in
it
but
if
the
thought
be
anywise
precious
to
you
is
it
essential
to
your
enjoyment
in
it
that
nothing
less
than
yourself
should
share
its
realization
are
you
the
lowest
kind
of
creature
that
be
permitted
to
live
had
god
been
of
like
heart
with
you
would
he
have
given
life
and
immortality
to
creatures
so
much
less
than
himself
as
we
are
these
not
worth
making
immortal
how
then
were
they
worth
calling
out
of
the
depth
of
it
is
a
greater
deed
to
make
be
that
which
was
not
than
to
seal
it
with
an
infinite
immortality
did
god
do
that
which
was
not
worth
doing
what
he
thought
worth
making
you
think
not
worth
continuing
made
you
would
have
him
go
on
for
ever
creating
new
things
with
one
hand
and
annihilating
those
he
had
made
with
the
other
for
i
presume
you
would
not
prefer
the
earth
to
be
without
animals
if
it
were
harder
for
god
to
make
the
former
go
on
living
than
to
send
forth
new
then
his
creatures
were
no
better
than
the
toys
which
a
child
makes
and
destroys
as
he
makes
them
for
what
good
for
what
divine
purpose
is
the
maker
of
the
sparrow
present
at
its
death
if
he
does
not
care
what
becomes
of
it
what
is
he
there
for
i
repeat
if
he
have
no
care
that
it
go
well
with
his
bird
in
its
dying
that
it
be
neither
comfortless
nor
lost
in
the
abyss
if
his
presence
be
no
good
to
the
sparrow
are
you
very
sure
what
good
it
will
be
to
you
when
your
hour
comes
believe
it
is
not
by
a
little
only
that
the
heart
of
the
universe
is
tenderer
more
loving
more
just
and
fair
than
yours
or
mine
if
you
did
not
believe
you
were
yourself
to
death
i
could
not
blame
you
for
thinking
all
was
over
with
the
sparrow
but
to
believe
in
immortality
for
yourself
and
not
care
to
believe
in
it
for
the
sparrow
would
be
simply
and
selfish
if
it
would
make
you
happy
to
think
there
was
life
beyond
death
for
the
sparrow
as
well
as
for
yourself
i
would
gladly
help
you
at
least
to
hope
that
there
may
be
i
know
of
no
reason
why
i
should
not
look
for
the
animals
to
rise
again
in
the
same
sense
in
which
i
hope
myself
to
rise
again
which
is
to
reappear
clothed
with
another
and
better
form
of
life
than
before
if
the
father
will
raise
his
children
why
should
he
not
also
raise
those
whom
he
has
taught
his
little
ones
to
love
love
is
the
one
bond
of
the
universe
the
heart
of
god
the
life
of
his
children
if
animals
can
be
loved
they
are
loveable
if
they
can
love
they
are
yet
more
plainly
loveable
love
is
eternal
how
then
should
its
object
perish
must
the
very
immortality
of
love
divide
the
bond
of
love
must
the
love
live
on
for
ever
without
its
object
or
worse
still
must
the
love
die
with
its
object
and
be
eternal
no
more
than
it
what
a
correlation
in
which
the
one
side
was
eternal
the
other
where
not
yet
annihilated
constantly
perishing
is
not
our
love
to
the
animals
a
precious
variety
of
love
and
if
god
gave
the
creatures
to
us
that
a
new
phase
of
love
might
be
born
in
us
toward
another
kind
of
life
from
the
same
fountain
why
should
the
new
life
be
more
perishing
than
the
new
love
can
you
imagine
that
if
one
of
god
little
ones
were
to
ask
him
to
give
again
one
of
the
earth
old
loves
kitten
or
pony
or
squirrel
or
dog
which
he
had
taken
from
him
the
father
would
say
no
if
the
thing
was
so
good
that
god
made
it
for
and
gave
it
to
the
child
at
first
who
never
asked
for
it
why
should
he
not
give
it
again
to
the
child
who
prays
for
it
because
the
father
had
made
him
love
it
what
a
child
may
ask
for
the
father
will
keep
ready
that
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
believing
thus
i
grant
that
there
are
impossibilities
i
deny
perhaps
the
first
difficulty
that
occurs
is
the
many
forms
of
life
which
we
can
not
desire
again
to
see
but
while
we
would
gladly
keep
the
perfected
forms
of
the
higher
animals
we
may
hope
that
those
of
many
other
kinds
are
as
transitory
as
their
bodies
belonging
but
to
a
stage
of
development
all
animal
forms
tend
to
higher
why
should
not
the
individual
as
well
as
the
race
pass
through
stages
of
ascent
if
i
have
myself
gone
through
each
of
the
typical
forms
of
lower
life
on
my
way
to
the
human
a
supposition
by
antenatal
history
rendered
probable
and
therefore
may
have
passed
through
any
number
of
individual
forms
of
life
i
do
not
see
why
each
of
the
lower
animals
should
not
as
well
pass
upward
through
a
succession
of
bettering
embodiments
i
grant
that
the
theory
requires
another
to
complement
it
namely
that
those
men
and
women
who
do
not
even
approximately
fulfil
the
conditions
of
their
elevated
rank
who
will
not
endeavour
after
the
great
idea
striving
to
ascend
are
sent
away
back
down
to
that
stage
of
development
say
of
fish
or
insect
or
reptile
beyond
which
their
moral
nature
has
refused
to
advance
who
has
not
seen
or
known
men
who
not
to
have
passed
or
indeed
in
some
things
to
have
approached
the
development
of
the
more
human
of
the
lower
animals
let
those
take
care
who
look
contemptuously
upon
the
animals
lest
in
misusing
one
of
them
they
misuse
some
ancestor
of
their
own
sent
back
as
the
one
mercy
for
him
to
reassume
far
past
forms
and
conditions
far
past
in
physical
that
is
but
not
in
moral
development
and
so
have
another
opportunity
of
passing
the
barrier
the
suggestion
may
appear
very
ridiculous
and
no
doubt
lends
itself
to
humorous
comment
but
what
if
it
should
be
true
what
if
the
amused
reader
should
himself
be
getting
ready
to
follow
the
remanded
ancestor
upon
it
however
i
do
not
care
to
spend
thought
or
time
least
of
all
argument
what
i
care
to
press
is
the
question
if
we
believe
in
the
progress
of
creation
as
hitherto
manifested
also
in
the
marvellous
changes
of
form
that
take
place
in
every
individual
of
certain
classes
why
should
there
be
any
difficulty
in
hoping
that
old
lives
may
reappear
in
new
forms
the
typical
soul
reappears
in
higher
formal
type
why
may
not
also
the
individual
soul
reappear
in
higher
form
multitudes
evidently
count
it
safest
to
hold
by
a
dull
scheme
of
things
can
it
be
because
like
david
in
browning
poem
they
dread
lest
they
should
worst
the
giver
by
inventing
better
gifts
than
his
that
we
do
not
know
is
the
best
reason
for
hoping
to
the
full
extent
god
has
made
possible
to
us
if
then
we
go
wrong
it
will
be
in
the
direction
of
the
right
and
with
such
aberration
as
will
be
easier
to
correct
than
what
must
come
of
refusing
to
imagine
and
leaving
the
dullest
traditional
prepossessions
to
rule
our
hearts
and
minds
with
no
claim
but
the
poverty
of
their
expectation
from
the
paternal
riches
those
that
hope
little
can
not
grow
much
to
them
the
very
glory
of
god
must
be
a
small
thing
for
their
hope
of
it
is
so
small
as
not
to
be
worth
rejoicing
in
that
he
is
a
faithful
creator
means
nothing
to
them
for
far
the
larger
portion
of
the
creatures
he
has
made
truly
their
notion
of
faithfulness
is
poor
enough
how
then
can
their
faith
be
strong
in
the
very
nature
of
divine
things
the
must
be
false
the
stupid
soul
which
can
not
know
its
own
stupidity
and
will
not
trouble
itself
either
to
understand
or
to
imagine
is
the
farthest
behind
of
all
the
backward
children
in
god
nursery
as
i
say
then
i
know
no
cause
of
reasonable
difficulty
in
regard
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
lower
animals
except
the
present
nature
of
some
of
them
but
what
christian
will
dare
to
say
that
god
does
not
care
about
them
and
he
knows
them
as
we
can
not
know
them
great
or
small
they
are
his
great
are
all
his
results
small
are
all
his
beginnings
that
we
have
to
send
many
of
his
creatures
out
of
this
phase
of
their
life
because
of
their
hurtfulness
in
this
phase
of
ours
is
to
me
no
the
very
fact
that
this
has
always
had
to
be
done
the
long
protracted
combat
of
the
race
with
such
and
the
constantly
repeated
though
not
invariable
victory
of
the
man
has
had
an
essential
and
incalculable
share
in
the
development
of
humanity
which
is
the
rendering
of
man
capable
of
knowing
god
and
when
their
part
to
that
end
is
no
longer
necessary
changed
conditions
may
speedily
so
operate
that
the
wolf
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
lie
down
with
the
kid
the
difficulty
may
go
for
nothing
in
view
of
the
forces
of
that
future
with
which
this
loving
speculation
concerns
itself
i
would
now
lead
my
companion
a
little
closer
to
what
the
apostle
says
in
the
nineteenth
verse
to
come
closer
if
we
may
to
the
idea
that
burned
in
his
heart
when
he
wrote
what
we
call
the
eighth
chapter
of
his
epistle
to
the
romans
oh
how
far
ahead
he
seems
in
his
hope
for
the
creation
of
the
footsore
and
halting
brigade
of
christians
at
present
crossing
the
world
he
knew
christ
and
could
therefore
look
into
the
will
of
the
father
the
earnest
expectation
of
the
creature
waiteth
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
at
the
head
of
one
of
his
poems
henry
vaughan
has
this
latin
translation
of
the
verse
i
do
not
know
whether
he
found
or
made
it
but
it
is
closer
to
its
sense
than
ours
res
creatae
exerto
capite
observantes
expectant
revelationem
filiorum
dei
the
things
created
watching
with
head
thrust
out
await
the
revelation
of
the
sons
of
god
why
because
god
has
subjected
the
creation
to
vanity
in
the
hope
that
the
creation
itself
shall
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
for
this
double
deliverance
from
corruption
and
the
consequent
subjection
to
vanity
the
creation
is
eagerly
watching
the
bondage
of
corruption
god
encounters
and
counteracts
by
subjection
to
vanity
corruption
is
the
breaking
up
of
the
essential
idea
the
falling
away
from
the
original
indwelling
and
thought
it
is
met
by
the
suffering
which
itself
causes
that
suffering
is
for
redemption
for
deliverance
it
is
the
life
in
the
corrupting
thing
that
makes
the
suffering
possible
it
is
the
live
part
not
the
corrupted
part
that
suffers
it
is
the
redeemable
not
the
doomed
thing
that
is
subjected
to
vanity
the
race
in
which
evil
that
is
corruption
is
at
work
needs
as
the
one
means
for
its
rescue
subjection
to
vanity
it
is
the
one
hope
against
the
supremacy
of
corruption
and
the
whole
encircling
harboring
and
helping
creation
must
for
the
sake
of
man
its
head
and
for
its
own
further
sake
too
share
in
this
subjection
to
vanity
with
its
hope
of
deliverance
corruption
brings
in
vanity
causes
empty
aching
gaps
in
vitality
this
aching
is
what
most
people
regard
as
evil
it
is
the
unpleasant
cure
of
evil
it
takes
all
shapes
of
suffering
of
the
body
of
the
mind
of
the
heart
of
the
spirit
it
is
altogether
beneficent
without
this
ever
invading
vanity
what
hope
would
there
be
for
the
rich
and
powerful
accustomed
to
and
set
upon
their
own
way
what
hope
for
the
the
conceited
the
greedy
the
miserly
the
more
things
men
seek
the
more
varied
the
things
they
imagine
they
need
the
more
are
they
subject
to
vanity
all
the
forms
of
which
may
be
summed
in
the
word
disappointment
he
who
would
not
house
with
disappointment
must
seek
the
incorruptible
the
true
he
must
break
the
bondage
of
havings
and
shows
of
rumours
and
praises
and
pretences
and
selfish
pleasures
he
must
come
out
of
the
false
into
the
real
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
light
out
of
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
to
bring
men
to
break
with
corruption
the
gulf
of
the
inane
yawns
before
them
aghast
in
soul
they
cry
of
vanities
all
is
vanity
and
beyond
the
abyss
begin
to
espy
the
eternal
world
of
truth
note
now
hope
that
the
creation
itself
also
as
something
besides
and
other
than
god
men
and
women
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
liberty
of
the
glory
of
the
children
of
god
the
creation
then
is
to
share
in
the
deliverance
and
liberty
and
glory
of
the
children
of
god
deliverance
from
corruption
liberty
from
bondage
must
include
escape
from
the
very
home
and
goal
of
corruption
namely
death
and
that
in
all
its
kinds
and
degrees
when
you
say
then
that
for
the
children
of
god
there
is
no
more
death
remember
that
the
deliverance
of
the
creature
is
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
dead
in
bondage
to
corruption
how
can
they
share
in
the
liberty
of
the
children
of
life
where
is
their
deliverance
if
such
then
be
the
words
of
the
apostle
does
he
or
does
he
not
i
ask
hold
the
idea
of
the
immortality
of
the
animals
if
you
say
all
he
means
is
that
the
creatures
alive
at
the
coming
of
the
lord
will
be
set
free
from
the
tyranny
of
corrupt
man
i
refer
you
to
what
i
have
already
said
of
the
poverty
of
such
an
interpretation
accepting
the
failure
of
justice
and
love
toward
those
that
have
passed
away
are
passing
and
must
yet
ere
that
coming
be
born
to
pass
away
for
ever
for
the
man
whose
heart
aches
to
adore
a
faithful
creator
what
comfort
lies
in
such
good
news
he
must
perish
for
lack
of
a
true
god
oh
lame
conclusion
to
the
grand
prophecy
is
god
a
mocker
who
will
not
be
mocked
is
there
a
past
to
god
with
which
he
has
done
is
time
too
much
for
him
is
he
god
enough
to
care
for
those
that
happen
to
live
at
one
present
time
but
not
god
enough
to
care
for
those
that
happened
to
live
at
another
present
time
or
did
he
care
for
them
but
could
not
help
them
shall
we
not
rather
believe
that
the
vessels
of
less
honour
the
misused
the
maltreated
shall
be
filled
full
with
creative
wine
at
last
shall
not
the
children
have
little
dogs
under
the
father
table
to
which
to
let
fall
plenty
of
crumbs
if
there
was
such
provision
for
the
sparrows
of
our
lord
time
of
sojourn
and
he
will
bring
yet
better
with
him
when
he
comes
again
how
should
the
dead
sparrows
and
their
sorrows
be
passed
over
of
him
with
whom
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
or
would
the
deliverance
of
the
creatures
into
the
liberty
have
been
much
worth
mentioning
if
within
a
few
years
their
share
in
the
glory
of
the
sons
of
god
was
to
die
away
in
death
but
the
gifts
of
god
are
without
repentance
how
st
paul
longs
for
and
loves
liberty
only
true
lover
of
liberty
is
he
who
will
die
to
give
it
to
his
neighbour
st
paul
loved
liberty
more
than
his
own
liberty
but
then
see
how
different
his
notion
of
the
liberty
on
its
way
to
the
children
of
god
from
the
dull
modern
fancies
of
heaven
still
set
forth
in
the
popular
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
will
at
least
be
a
heaven
and
an
earth
what
would
the
newest
earth
be
to
the
old
children
without
its
animals
barer
than
the
heavens
emptied
of
the
constellations
that
are
called
by
their
names
then
if
the
earth
must
have
its
animals
why
not
the
old
ones
already
dear
the
sons
of
god
are
not
a
new
race
of
sons
of
god
but
the
old
race
glorified
why
a
new
race
of
animals
and
not
the
old
ones
glorified
the
apostle
says
they
are
to
share
in
the
liberty
of
the
sons
of
god
will
it
not
then
be
a
liberty
like
ours
a
liberty
always
ready
to
be
offered
on
the
altar
of
love
what
sweet
service
will
not
that
of
the
animals
be
thus
offered
how
sweet
also
to
minister
to
them
in
their
turns
of
need
for
to
us
doubtless
will
they
then
flee
for
help
in
any
difficulty
as
now
they
flee
from
us
in
dread
of
our
tyranny
what
lovelier
feature
in
the
newness
of
the
new
earth
than
the
old
animals
glorified
with
us
in
their
home
with
us
our
common
home
the
house
of
our
father
each
kind
an
unfailing
pleasure
to
the
other
ah
what
horses
ah
what
dogs
ah
what
wild
beasts
and
what
birds
in
the
air
the
whole
redeemed
creation
goes
to
make
up
st
paul
heaven
he
had
learned
of
him
who
would
leave
no
one
out
who
made
the
excuse
for
his
murderers
that
they
did
not
know
what
they
were
doing
is
not
the
prophecy
on
the
groaning
creation
to
have
its
fulfilment
in
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
does
not
this
involve
its
existence
beyond
what
we
call
this
world
why
should
it
not
then
involve
immortality
would
it
not
be
more
like
the
king
eternal
immortal
invisible
to
know
no
life
but
the
immortal
to
create
nothing
that
could
die
to
slay
nothing
but
evil
he
is
not
a
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
for
all
live
unto
him
but
what
is
this
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
for
which
the
whole
creation
is
waiting
the
children
themselves
are
waiting
for
it
when
they
have
it
then
will
their
house
and
retinue
the
creation
whose
fate
hangs
on
that
of
the
children
share
it
with
them
what
is
this
liberty
all
liberty
must
of
course
consist
in
the
realization
of
the
ideal
harmony
between
the
creative
will
and
the
created
life
in
the
correspondence
of
the
creature
active
being
to
the
creator
idea
which
is
his
substantial
soul
in
other
words
the
creature
liberty
is
what
his
obedience
to
the
law
of
his
existence
the
will
of
his
maker
effects
for
him
the
instant
a
soul
moves
counter
to
the
will
of
its
prime
cause
the
universe
is
its
prison
it
dashes
against
the
walls
of
it
and
the
sweetest
of
its
uplifting
and
sustaining
forces
at
once
become
its
manacles
and
fetters
but
st
paul
is
not
at
the
moment
thinking
either
of
the
metaphysical
notion
of
liberty
or
of
its
religious
realization
he
has
in
his
thought
the
birth
of
the
consciousness
of
freedom
not
only
so
that
the
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
ourselves
also
which
have
the
first
fruits
of
the
spirit
even
we
ourselves
groan
within
ourselves
waiting
for
the
redemption
of
our
body
we
are
not
free
he
implies
until
our
body
is
redeemed
then
all
the
creation
will
be
free
with
us
he
regards
the
creation
as
part
of
our
embodiment
the
whole
creation
is
waiting
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
god
that
is
the
redemption
of
their
body
the
idea
of
which
extends
to
their
whole
material
envelopment
with
all
the
life
that
belongs
to
it
for
this
as
for
them
the
bonds
of
corruption
must
fall
away
it
must
enter
into
the
same
liberty
with
them
and
be
that
for
which
it
was
created
a
vital
temple
perfected
by
the
unbroken
indwelling
of
its
divinity
the
liberty
here
intended
it
may
be
unnecessary
to
say
is
not
that
essential
liberty
freedom
from
sin
but
the
completing
of
the
redemption
of
the
spirit
by
the
redemption
of
the
body
the
perfecting
of
the
greater
by
its
necessary
complement
of
the
less
evil
has
been
constantly
at
work
turning
our
house
of
the
body
into
a
prison
rendering
it
more
opaque
and
heavy
and
insensible
casting
about
it
bands
and
cerements
and
filling
it
with
aches
and
pains
the
freest
soul
the
purest
of
lovers
the
man
most
incapable
of
anything
mean
would
not
for
all
his
mighty
liberty
yet
feel
absolutely
at
large
while
chained
to
a
dying
body
nor
the
less
hampered
but
the
more
that
that
dying
body
was
his
own
the
redemption
of
the
body
therefore
the
making
of
it
for
the
man
a
genuine
perfected
responsive
is
essential
to
the
apostle
notion
of
a
man
deliverance
the
new
man
must
have
a
new
body
with
a
new
heaven
and
earth
st
paul
never
thinks
of
himself
as
released
from
body
he
desires
a
perfect
one
and
of
a
nobler
sort
he
would
inhabit
a
house
and
give
up
the
one
suitable
only
to
this
lower
stage
of
life
infected
and
unsafe
from
the
first
and
now
much
dilapidated
in
the
service
of
the
master
who
could
so
easily
give
him
a
better
he
wants
a
spiritual
body
a
body
that
will
not
thwart
but
second
the
needs
and
aspirations
of
the
spirit
he
had
in
his
mind
i
presume
such
a
body
as
the
lord
died
with
changed
by
the
interpenetrating
of
the
creative
indwelling
will
to
a
heavenly
body
the
body
with
which
he
rose
a
body
like
the
lord
is
i
imagine
necessary
to
bring
us
into
true
and
perfect
contact
with
the
creation
of
which
there
must
be
multitudinous
phases
whereof
we
can
not
now
be
even
aware
the
way
in
which
both
good
and
indifferent
people
alike
lay
the
blame
on
their
bodies
and
look
to
death
rather
than
struggle
to
set
them
at
liberty
appears
to
me
low
and
cowardly
it
is
the
master
fleeing
from
the
slave
despising
at
once
and
fearing
him
we
must
hold
the
supremacy
over
our
bodies
but
we
must
not
despise
body
it
is
a
divine
thing
body
and
soul
are
in
the
image
of
god
and
the
lord
of
life
was
last
seen
in
the
glorified
body
of
his
death
i
believe
that
he
still
wears
that
body
but
we
shall
do
better
without
these
bodies
that
suffer
and
grow
old
which
may
indeed
as
some
think
be
but
the
outer
cases
the
husks
of
our
real
bodies
endlessly
helpful
as
they
have
been
to
us
and
that
in
a
measure
incalculable
through
their
very
subjection
to
vanity
we
are
yet
surely
not
in
altogether
and
only
helpful
company
so
long
as
the
houses
wherein
we
live
have
so
many
spots
and
stains
in
them
which
friendly
death
it
may
be
can
alone
wash
out
so
many
and
sores
which
the
hand
pulling
down
and
rebuilding
of
fresh
and
nobler
material
alone
can
banish
when
the
sons
then
are
free
when
their
bodies
are
redeemed
they
will
lift
up
with
them
the
lower
creation
into
their
liberty
st
paul
seems
to
believe
that
perfection
in
their
kind
awaits
also
the
humbler
inhabitants
of
our
world
its
advent
to
follow
immediately
on
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
god
for
our
sakes
and
their
own
they
have
been
made
subject
to
vanity
for
our
sakes
and
their
own
they
shall
be
restored
and
glorified
that
is
raised
higher
with
us
has
the
question
no
interest
for
you
it
would
have
much
had
you
now
what
you
must
one
day
have
a
heart
big
enough
to
love
any
life
god
has
thought
fit
to
create
had
the
lord
cared
no
more
for
what
of
his
father
was
lower
than
himself
than
you
do
for
what
of
your
is
lower
than
you
you
would
not
now
be
looking
for
any
sort
of
redemption
i
have
omitted
in
my
quotations
the
word
used
in
both
english
versions
it
is
no
translation
of
the
greek
word
for
which
it
stands
it
is
used
by
st
paul
as
meaning
the
same
thing
with
the
phrase
redemption
of
the
body
a
fact
to
bring
the
interpretation
given
it
at
once
into
question
falser
translation
if
we
look
at
the
importance
of
the
thing
signified
and
its
utter
loss
in
the
word
used
to
represent
it
not
to
mention
the
substitution
for
that
of
the
apostle
of
an
idea
not
only
untrue
but
actively
mischievous
was
never
made
the
thing
st
paul
means
in
the
word
he
uses
has
simply
nothing
to
do
with
adoption
nothing
whatever
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
chapter
of
his
epistle
to
the
galatians
he
makes
perfectly
clear
what
he
intends
by
it
his
unusual
word
means
the
father
recognition
when
he
comes
of
age
of
the
child
relation
to
him
by
giving
him
his
fitting
place
of
dignity
in
the
house
and
here
the
deliverance
of
the
body
is
the
act
of
this
recognition
by
the
great
father
completing
and
crowning
and
declaring
the
freedom
of
the
man
the
perfecting
of
the
last
lingering
remnant
of
his
deliverance
st
paul
word
i
repeat
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
means
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
god
the
showing
of
those
as
sons
who
have
always
been
his
children
the
bringing
of
them
out
before
the
universe
in
such
suitable
attire
and
with
such
fit
attendance
that
to
look
at
them
is
to
see
what
they
are
the
sons
of
the
house
such
to
whom
their
elder
brother
applied
the
words
said
ye
are
gods
if
then
the
sons
groan
within
themselves
looking
to
be
lifted
up
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
same
world
groan
with
them
and
cry
shall
they
not
also
be
lifted
up
have
they
not
also
a
faithful
creator
he
must
be
a
selfish
man
indeed
who
does
not
desire
that
it
should
be
so
it
appears
then
that
in
the
expectation
of
the
apostle
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
in
which
dwell
the
sons
of
god
are
to
be
inhabited
by
blessed
animals
also
inferior
but
risen
and
i
think
yet
to
rise
in
continuous
development
here
let
me
revert
a
moment
and
say
a
little
more
clearly
and
strongly
a
thing
i
have
already
said
when
the
apostle
speaks
of
the
whole
creation
is
it
possible
he
should
have
dismissed
the
animals
from
his
thoughts
to
regard
the
trees
and
flowers
bearing
their
part
in
the
groaning
and
travailing
of
the
sore
burdened
world
or
could
he
animals
and
trees
and
flowers
forgotten
have
intended
by
the
creation
that
groaned
and
travailed
only
the
bulk
of
the
earth
its
mountains
and
valleys
plains
and
seas
and
rivers
its
agglomeration
of
hard
and
soft
of
hot
and
cold
of
moist
and
dry
if
he
could
then
the
portion
that
least
can
be
supposed
to
feel
or
know
is
regarded
by
the
apostle
of
love
as
immeasurably
more
important
than
the
portion
that
loves
and
moans
and
cries
nor
is
this
all
for
thereupon
he
attributes
the
of
the
excluded
far
more
sentient
portion
at
least
to
the
altogether
inferior
and
less
sentient
and
upon
the
ground
of
that
faculty
builds
the
vision
of
its
redemption
if
it
could
be
so
then
how
should
the
seeming
apostle
affected
rhapsody
of
hope
be
to
us
other
than
a
mere
of
falsest
rhetoric
a
for
nothing
as
degrading
to
art
as
objectless
in
nature
much
would
i
like
to
know
clearly
what
animals
the
apostle
saw
on
his
travels
or
around
his
home
when
he
had
one
their
conditions
and
their
relations
to
their
superiors
anyhow
they
were
often
suffering
creatures
and
paul
was
a
man
growing
hourly
in
likeness
to
his
maker
and
theirs
therefore
overflowing
with
sympathy
perhaps
as
he
wrote
there
passed
through
his
mind
a
throb
of
pity
for
the
beasts
he
had
to
kill
at
ephesus
if
the
lord
said
very
little
about
animals
could
he
have
done
more
for
them
than
tell
men
that
his
father
cared
for
them
he
has
thereby
wakened
and
is
wakening
in
the
hearts
of
men
a
seed
his
father
planted
it
grows
but
slowly
yet
has
already
borne
a
little
precious
fruit
his
loving
friend
st
francis
has
helped
him
and
many
others
have
tried
and
are
now
trying
to
help
him
whoever
sows
the
seed
of
that
seed
the
father
planted
is
helping
the
son
our
behaviour
to
the
animals
our
words
concerning
them
are
seed
either
good
or
bad
in
the
hearts
of
our
children
no
one
can
tell
to
what
the
animals
might
not
grow
even
here
on
the
old
earth
under
the
old
heaven
if
they
were
but
dealt
with
according
to
their
true
position
in
regard
to
us
they
are
in
sense
very
real
and
divine
our
kindred
if
i
call
them
our
poor
relations
it
is
to
suggest
that
poor
relations
are
often
ill
used
relatives
poor
or
rich
may
be
such
ill
behaved
disagreeable
persons
that
we
can
not
treat
them
as
we
gladly
would
but
our
endeavour
should
be
to
develop
every
true
relation
he
who
is
prejudiced
against
a
relative
because
he
is
poor
is
himself
an
relative
and
to
be
is
an
excluding
fault
with
the
court
of
the
high
countries
there
poverty
is
welcome
vulgarity
inadmissible
those
who
love
certain
animals
selfishly
pampering
them
as
so
many
mothers
do
their
children
with
worse
results
that
they
may
be
loved
of
them
in
return
betray
them
to
their
enemies
they
are
not
lovers
of
animals
but
only
of
favourites
and
do
their
part
to
make
the
rest
of
the
world
dislike
animals
theirs
are
the
dogs
that
inhospitably
growl
and
bark
and
snap
moving
the
indifferent
to
dislike
and
confirming
the
unfriendly
in
their
antagonism
any
met
in
the
interests
of
their
kind
would
condemn
such
dogs
to
be
discreetly
bitten
and
their
mistresses
to
be
avoided
and
certainly
if
animals
are
intended
to
live
and
grow
she
is
the
enemy
of
any
individual
animal
who
stunts
his
moral
and
intellectual
development
by
unwise
indulgence
of
whatever
nature
be
the
heaven
of
the
animals
that
animal
is
not
in
the
fair
way
to
enter
it
the
education
of
the
lower
lies
at
the
door
of
the
higher
and
in
true
education
is
truest
kindness
but
what
shall
i
say
of
such
as
for
any
kind
of
end
subject
animals
to
torture
i
dare
hardly
trust
myself
to
the
expression
of
my
judgment
of
their
conduct
in
this
regard
are
investigators
we
are
not
doing
it
for
our
own
sakes
but
for
the
sake
of
others
our
the
higher
your
motive
for
it
the
greater
is
the
blame
of
your
unrighteousness
must
we
congratulate
you
on
such
a
love
for
your
fellows
as
inspires
you
to
wrong
the
weaker
than
they
those
that
are
without
helper
against
you
shall
we
count
the
man
worthy
who
for
the
sake
of
his
friend
robbed
another
man
too
feeble
to
protect
himself
and
too
poor
to
punish
his
assailant
for
the
sake
of
your
children
would
you
waylay
a
beggar
no
real
good
can
grow
in
the
soil
of
injustice
i
can
not
help
suspecting
however
that
the
desire
to
know
has
a
greater
share
in
the
enormity
than
the
desire
to
help
alas
for
the
science
that
will
sacrifice
the
law
of
righteousness
but
to
behold
a
law
of
sequence
the
tree
of
knowledge
will
never
prove
to
man
the
tree
of
life
there
is
no
law
says
thou
shalt
know
a
thousand
laws
cry
out
thou
shalt
do
right
these
men
are
a
law
unto
themselves
and
what
a
law
it
is
the
old
story
the
greed
of
knowing
casts
out
righteousness
and
mercy
and
faith
whatever
believed
a
benefit
may
or
may
not
thus
be
wrought
for
higher
creatures
the
injustice
to
the
lower
is
nowise
affected
justice
has
no
respect
of
persons
but
they
are
surely
the
weaker
that
stand
more
in
need
of
justice
labour
is
a
law
of
the
universe
and
is
not
an
evil
death
is
a
law
of
this
world
at
least
and
is
not
an
evil
torture
is
the
law
of
no
world
but
the
hell
of
human
invention
labour
and
death
are
for
the
best
good
of
those
that
labour
and
die
they
are
laws
of
life
torture
is
doubtless
for
the
good
of
the
tortured
but
it
will
one
day
burn
a
very
hell
in
the
hearts
of
the
torturers
torture
can
be
inflicted
only
by
the
superior
the
divine
idea
of
a
superior
is
one
who
requires
duty
and
protects
helps
delivers
our
relation
to
the
animals
is
that
of
their
superiors
in
the
family
who
require
labour
it
may
be
but
are
just
helpful
protective
can
they
know
anything
of
the
father
who
neither
love
nor
rule
their
inferiors
but
use
them
as
a
child
his
insensate
toys
pulling
them
to
pieces
to
know
what
is
inside
them
such
men
of
science
let
them
have
the
dignity
to
the
fullness
of
its
worth
lust
to
know
as
if
a
life
lay
in
knowing
as
if
it
were
a
vile
thing
to
be
ignorant
so
vile
that
for
the
sake
of
his
secret
hoard
of
facts
they
do
right
in
breaking
with
torture
into
the
house
of
the
innocent
surely
they
shall
not
thus
find
the
way
of
understanding
surely
there
is
a
maniac
thirst
for
knowledge
as
a
maniac
thirst
for
wine
or
for
blood
he
who
loves
knowledge
the
most
genuinely
will
with
the
most
patience
wait
for
it
until
it
can
be
had
righteously
need
i
argue
the
injustice
can
a
sentient
creature
come
forth
without
rights
without
claim
to
or
to
consideration
from
the
other
creatures
whom
they
find
equally
without
action
of
their
own
present
in
space
if
one
answer
aught
i
know
it
may
be
so
where
then
are
thy
own
rights
i
ask
if
another
have
none
thine
must
lie
in
thy
superior
power
and
will
there
not
one
day
come
a
stronger
than
thou
mayst
thou
not
one
day
be
in
naboth
place
with
an
ahab
getting
up
to
go
into
thy
vineyard
to
possess
it
the
rich
man
may
come
prowling
after
thy
little
ewe
lamb
and
what
wilt
thou
have
to
say
he
may
be
the
stronger
and
thou
the
weaker
that
the
rights
of
the
animals
are
so
much
less
than
ours
does
not
surely
argue
them
the
less
rights
they
have
little
and
we
have
much
ought
they
therefore
to
have
less
and
we
more
must
we
not
rather
be
the
more
honourably
anxious
that
they
have
their
little
to
the
full
every
gain
of
injustice
is
a
loss
to
the
world
for
life
consists
neither
in
length
of
days
nor
in
ease
of
body
greed
of
life
and
wrong
done
to
secure
it
will
never
work
anything
but
direst
loss
as
to
knowledge
let
justice
guide
thy
search
and
thou
wilt
know
the
sooner
do
the
will
of
god
and
thou
shalt
know
god
and
he
will
open
thine
eyes
to
look
into
the
very
heart
of
knowledge
force
thy
violent
way
and
gain
knowledge
to
miss
truth
thou
mayest
wound
the
heart
of
god
but
thou
canst
not
rend
it
asunder
to
find
the
truth
that
sits
there
enthroned
what
man
would
he
be
who
accepted
the
offer
to
be
healed
and
kept
alive
by
means
which
necessitated
the
torture
of
certain
animals
would
he
feel
himself
a
gentleman
walking
the
earth
with
the
sense
that
his
life
and
conscious
were
informed
and
upheld
by
the
agonies
of
other
lives
hope
sir
your
health
is
better
than
it
has
been
you
i
am
wonderfully
restored
have
entered
in
truth
upon
a
fresh
lease
of
life
my
organism
has
been
nourished
with
the
agonies
of
several
dogs
and
the
pangs
of
a
multitude
of
rabbits
and
and
i
am
aware
of
a
marvellous
change
for
the
better
they
gave
me
their
lives
and
i
gave
them
in
return
worse
pains
than
mine
the
bargain
has
proved
a
quite
satisfactory
one
true
their
lives
were
theirs
not
mine
but
then
their
sufferings
were
theirs
not
mine
they
could
not
defend
themselves
they
had
not
a
word
to
say
so
reasonable
was
the
exchange
poor
fools
they
were
neither
so
wise
nor
so
strong
nor
such
lovers
of
comfort
as
i
if
they
could
not
take
care
of
themselves
that
was
their
not
mine
every
animal
for
himself
there
was
a
certain
patriotic
priest
who
thought
it
better
to
put
a
just
man
to
death
than
that
a
whole
nation
should
perish
precious
salvation
that
might
be
wrought
by
injustice
but
then
the
just
man
taught
that
the
rich
man
and
the
beggar
must
one
day
change
places
set
the
life
of
a
dog
against
the
life
of
a
human
being
no
but
the
torture
of
a
dog
against
the
prolonged
life
of
a
being
capable
of
torturing
him
priceless
gain
the
lengthening
of
such
a
life
to
the
man
and
his
friends
and
his
country
that
the
animals
do
not
suffer
so
much
as
we
should
under
like
inflictions
i
hope
true
and
think
true
but
is
toothache
nothing
because
there
are
yet
worse
pains
for
head
and
face
not
a
few
who
now
regard
themselves
as
benefactors
of
mankind
will
one
day
be
looked
upon
with
a
disapprobation
which
no
argument
will
now
convince
them
they
deserve
but
yet
another
day
is
coming
when
they
will
themselves
right
sorrowfully
pour
out
disapprobation
upon
their
own
deeds
for
they
are
not
stones
but
men
and
must
repent
let
them
in
the
interests
of
humanity
give
their
own
entrails
to
the
knife
their
own
silver
cord
to
be
laid
bare
their
own
golden
bowl
to
be
watched
throbbing
and
i
will
worship
at
their
feet
but
shall
i
admire
their
discoveries
at
the
expense
of
the
stranger
nay
no
stranger
the
poor
brother
within
their
gates
your
conscience
does
not
trouble
you
take
heed
that
the
light
that
is
in
you
be
not
darkness
whatever
judgment
mean
will
it
suffice
you
in
that
hour
to
say
burning
desire
to
know
how
life
wrought
in
him
drove
me
through
the
gates
and
bars
of
his
living
house
i
doubt
if
you
will
add
in
your
heart
any
more
than
with
your
tongue
i
did
well
to
those
who
expect
a
world
to
come
i
say
then
let
us
take
heed
how
we
carry
ourselves
to
the
creation
which
is
to
occupy
with
us
the
world
to
come
to
those
whose
hearts
are
sore
for
that
creation
i
say
the
lord
is
mindful
of
his
own
and
will
save
both
man
and
beast
the
end
