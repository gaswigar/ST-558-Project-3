gingerly
sitting
on

edge
of
a
chair
what
the
matter
patty
olivia

i
have
just
run
away
from

bishop

i
peters
the
susceptible
observed
patty
sucking
an
injured
thumb
were
evidently
not
made
for
driving
in
tacks
i
wish
i
had
a
hammer
this
remark
called
forth
no
response
and
patty
peered
down
from
the
top
of
the
at
her
who
was
sitting
on
the
floor
dragging
and
curtains
from
a
box
priscilla
she
begged
you
are
doing
anything
useful
go
down
and
ask
peters
for
a
hammer
priscilla
rose
reluctantly
i
dare
say
fifty
girls
have
already
been
after
a
hammer
oh
he
has
a
private
one
in
his
back
pocket
borrow
that
and
pris
patty
called
after
her
over
the
transom
just
tell
him
to
send
up
a
man
to
take
that
closet
door
off
its
hinges
patty
in
the
interval
sat
down
on
the
top
step
and
surveyed
the
chaos
beneath
her
an
oriental
rush
chair
very
much
out
at
the
elbows
several
miscellaneous
chairs
two
desks
a
divan
a
table
and
two
boxes
radiated
from
the
center
of
the
room
the
floor
as
it
showed
through
the
interstices
was
covered
with
a
carpet
while
the
curtains
and
hangings
were
of
a
not
very
subdued
crimson
one
would
scarcely
patty
remarked
to
the
furniture
in
general
call
it
a
symphony
in
color
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
come
in
she
called
a
girl
in
a
blue
linen
reaching
to
her
ankles
and
with
a
braid
of
hair
hanging
down
her
back
appeared
in
the
doorway
patty
examined
her
in
silence
the
girl
eyes
traveled
around
the
room
in
some
surprise
and
finally
reached
the
top
of
the
ladder
i
i
a
freshman
she
began
my
dear
murmured
patty
in
a
deprecatory
tone
i
should
have
taken
you
for
a
senior
but
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
toward
the
nearest
box
come
in
and
sit
down
i
need
your
advice
now
there
are
shades
of
green
she
went
on
as
if
continuing
a
conversation
which
are
not
so
bad
with
red
but
i
ask
you
frankly
if
shade
of
green
would
go
with
anything
the
freshman
looked
at
patty
and
looked
at
the
carpet
and
smiled
dubiously
no
she
admitted
i
do
believe
it
would
i
knew
you
would
say
that
exclaimed
patty
in
a
tone
of
relief
now
what
would
you
advise
us
to
do
with
the
carpet
the
freshman
looked
blank
i
i
do
know
unless
you
take
it
up
she
stammered
the
very
thing
said
patty
i
wonder
we
had
thought
of
it
before
priscilla
reappeared
at
this
point
with
the
announcement
peters
is
the
most
suspicious
man
i
ever
knew
but
she
stopped
uncertainly
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
freshman
priscilla
said
patty
severely
i
you
did
divulge
the
fact
that
we
are
hanging
the
walls
with
tapestry
this
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
toward
the
printed
cotton
cloth
dangling
from
the
molding
i
tried
not
to
said
priscilla
guiltily
but
he
read
in
my
eyes
he
had
no
sooner
looked
at
me
than
he
said
here
miss
you
know
it
against
the
rules
to
hang
curtains
on
the
walls
and
you
must
put
nails
in
the
plastering
and
i
do
believe
you
need
a
hammer
anyway
disgusting
creature
said
patty
but
continued
priscilla
hastily
i
stopped
and
borrowed
georgie
merriles
hammer
on
my
way
back
oh
i
forgot
she
added
he
says
we
ca
take
the
closet
door
off
its
hinges
that
as
soon
as
we
get
ours
off
five
hundred
other
young
ladies
will
be
wanting
theirs
off
and
that
it
would
take
half
a
dozen
men
all
summer
to
put
them
back
again
a
portentous
frown
was
gathering
on
patty
brow
and
the
freshman
wishing
to
avert
a
possible
domestic
tragedy
inquired
timidly
who
is
peters
peters
said
priscilla
is
a
short
gentleman
with
a
red
vandyke
beard
whose
technical
title
is
janitor
but
who
is
really
dictator
every
one
is
afraid
of
him
even
prexy
i
not
said
patty
and
she
added
firmly
that
door
is
coming
down
whether
he
says
so
or
not
so
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
do
it
ourselves
her
eyes
wandered
back
to
the
carpet
and
her
face
brightened
oh
pris
we
got
a
beautiful
new
scheme
my
friend
here
says
she
does
like
the
carpet
at
all
and
suggests
that
we
take
it
up
get
some
black
paint
and
put
it
on
the
floor
ourselves
i
agree
she
added
that
a
flemish
oak
floor
covered
with
rugs
would
be
a
great
improvement
priscilla
glanced
uncertainly
from
the
freshman
to
the
floor
do
you
think
they
let
us
do
it
it
would
never
do
to
ask
them
said
patty
the
freshman
rose
uneasily
i
came
she
said
hesitatingly
to
find
out
that
is
i
understand
that
the
girls
rent
their
old
books
and
i
thought
if
you
would
mind
mind
said
patty
reassuringly
we
rent
our
souls
for
fifty
cents
a
semester
it
it
was
a
latin
dictionary
i
wanted
said
the
freshman
and
the
girls
next
door
said
perhaps
you
had
one
a
beautiful
one
said
patty
no
interrupted
priscilla
hers
is
lost
from
o
to
r
and
it
all
torn
but
mine
she
dived
down
into
one
of
the
boxes
and
hauled
out
a
chunky
volume
without
any
covers
while
it
is
not
so
beautiful
as
it
was
once
it
is
still
as
useful
mine
annotated
said
patty
and
illustrated
i
show
you
what
a
superior
book
it
is
and
she
began
descending
the
ladder
but
priscilla
charged
upon
her
and
she
retreated
to
the
top
again
why
she
wailed
to
the
terrified
freshman
did
you
not
say
you
wanted
a
dictionary
before
she
came
back
let
me
give
you
some
advice
at
the
beginning
of
your
college
career
she
added
warningly
never
choose
a
bigger
than
yourself
they
dangerous
the
freshman
was
backing
precipitously
toward
the
door
when
it
opened
and
revealed
an
girl
with
fluffy
reddish
hair
pris
you
wretch
you
walked
off
with
my
hammer
oh
georgie
we
need
it
worse
than
you
do
come
in
and
help
tack
hello
georgie
called
patty
from
the
ladder
is
this
room
going
to
be
beautiful
when
it
finished
georgie
looked
about
you
are
more
sanguine
than
i
should
be
she
laughed
you
ca
tell
yet
patty
returned
we
going
to
cover
the
with
this
red
stuff
and
paint
the
floor
black
and
have
dark
furniture
and
red
hangings
and
soft
lights
it
will
look
just
like
the
oriental
room
in
the
waldorf
how
in
the
world
georgie
demanded
do
you
ever
make
them
let
you
do
all
these
things
i
stuck
in
three
innocent
little
and
peters
descended
upon
me
bristling
with
wrath
and
said
he
report
me
if
i
did
pull
them
out
we
never
ask
explained
patty
it
the
only
way
you
got
enough
to
do
if
you
expect
to
get
settled
by
monday
georgie
remarked
agreed
patty
descending
the
ladder
with
a
sudden
access
of
energy
and
you
got
to
stay
and
help
us
we
have
to
get
all
this
furniture
moved
into
the
bedrooms
and
the
carpet
up
before
we
even
to
paint
she
regarded
the
freshman
tentatively
are
you
awfully
busy
not
very
my
has
come
yet
so
i
ca
settle
that
nice
then
you
can
help
us
move
furniture
patty
said
priscilla
i
think
you
are
too
bad
i
should
really
love
to
stay
and
help
if
you
let
me
certainly
said
patty
obligingly
i
forgot
to
ask
your
name
she
continued
and
i
do
suppose
you
like
to
be
called
not
specific
enough
my
name
is
genevieve
ainslee
randolph
genevieve
ains
dear
me
i
ca
remember
anything
like
that
do
you
mind
if
i
call
you
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
for
short
the
freshman
looked
doubtful
and
patty
proceeded
lady
clara
allow
me
to
present
my
miss
priscilla
pond
no
relation
to
the
extract
she
athletic
and
wins
dashes
and
hurdle
races
and
gets
her
name
in
the
paper
to
a
really
gratifying
extent
and
my
dear
friend
miss
georgie
merriles
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
dakota
miss
merriles
is
very
talented
sings
in
the
glee
club
plays
on
the
comb
and
interrupted
georgie
let
me
present
miss
patty
wyatt
who
has
no
specialty
said
patty
modestly
but
is
merely
good
and
beautiful
and
bright
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
which
opened
without
waiting
for
a
response
miss
theodora
bartlet
continued
patty
commonly
known
as
the
twin
miss
vere
de
vere
the
twin
looked
dazed
murmured
miss
vere
de
vere
and
dropped
down
on
a
box
the
term
explained
patty
is
used
in
a
merely
allegorical
sense
there
is
really
only
one
of
her
the
title
was
conferred
in
her
freshman
year
and
the
reason
has
been
lost
in
the
dim
dawn
of
antiquity
the
freshman
looked
at
the
twin
and
opened
her
mouth
but
shut
it
again
without
saying
anything
my
favorite
maxim
said
patty
has
always
been
is
golden
i
observe
that
we
are
kindred
spirits
patty
said
priscilla
do
stop
bothering
that
poor
child
and
get
to
work
bothering
said
patty
i
am
not
bothering
her
we
are
just
getting
acquainted
however
i
dare
say
it
is
not
the
time
for
hollow
civilities
do
you
want
to
borrow
anything
she
added
turning
to
the
twin
or
did
you
just
drop
in
to
pay
a
social
call
just
a
social
call
but
i
think
i
come
in
again
when
there
no
furniture
to
move
you
do
happen
to
be
going
into
town
this
afternoon
yes
said
the
twin
but
she
added
guardedly
if
it
a
i
refuse
to
bring
it
out
i
offered
to
bring
one
out
for
lucille
carter
last
night
because
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
give
a
and
i
speared
the
conductor
with
it
getting
into
the
car
and
while
i
was
apologizing
to
him
i
knocked
prexy
hat
off
with
the
other
end
we
have
all
the
we
need
said
patty
it
just
some
paint
five
cans
of
black
paint
and
three
brushes
at
the
store
and
thank
you
very
much
now
she
continued
the
first
thing
is
to
get
that
door
down
and
i
will
wrest
a
from
the
unwilling
peters
while
you
remove
tacks
from
the
carpet
he
wo
give
you
one
said
priscilla
you
see
said
patty
five
minutes
later
she
returned
waving
above
her
head
an
unmistakable
mes
amies
peters
own
private
for
which
i
am
to
be
personally
responsible
how
did
you
get
it
inquired
priscilla
suspiciously
you
act
said
patty
as
if
you
thought
i
knocked
him
down
in
some
dark
corner
and
robbed
him
i
merely
asked
him
for
it
politely
and
he
asked
me
what
i
wanted
to
do
with
it
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
take
out
screws
and
the
reason
impressed
him
so
that
he
handed
it
over
without
a
word
peters
she
added
is
a
dear
only
he
like
every
other
man
you
have
to
use
diplomacy
by
ten
that
night
the
study
carpet
of
was
neatly
folded
and
deposited
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
above
whence
its
origin
would
be
difficult
to
trace
the
entire
region
was
steeped
in
an
odor
of
turpentine
and
the
study
floor
of
was
a
shining
black
except
for
four
or
five
unpainted
spots
which
patty
designated
as
and
which
were
to
be
treated
later
every
caller
that
had
dropped
in
during
the
afternoon
or
evening
had
had
a
brush
thrust
into
her
hand
and
had
been
made
to
go
down
upon
her
knees
and
paint
besides
the
floor
three
bookcases
and
a
chair
had
been
transferred
from
mahogany
to
flemish
oak
and
there
was
still
half
a
can
of
paint
left
which
patty
was
anxiously
trying
to
dispose
of
the
next
morning
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
about
the
had
been
reërected
and
the
business
of
was
going
forward
with
enthusiasm
when
a
knock
suddenly
interrupted
the
work
patty
all
unconscious
of
impending
doom
cheerily
called
come
in
the
door
opened
and
the
figure
of
peters
appeared
on
the
threshold
and
priscilla
basely
fled
leaving
her
stranded
on
the
ladder
are
you
the
young
lady
who
borrowed
my
screw
peters
stopped
and
looked
at
the
floor
and
his
jaw
dropped
in
astonishment
where
is
that
there
carpet
he
demanded
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
thought
it
was
under
the
paint
it
out
in
the
hall
said
patty
pleasantly
please
be
careful
and
do
step
on
the
paint
it
a
great
improvement
do
you
think
you
oughter
got
permission
he
began
but
his
eye
fell
on
the
tapestry
and
he
stopped
again
yes
said
patty
but
we
knew
you
could
spare
a
man
just
now
to
paint
it
for
us
so
we
did
like
to
trouble
you
it
against
the
rules
to
hang
curtains
on
the
walls
i
have
heard
that
it
was
said
patty
affably
and
i
think
ordinarily
it
a
very
good
rule
but
just
look
at
the
color
of
that
it
you
have
had
enough
experience
with
peters
to
know
that
is
impossible
especially
when
our
and
portières
are
red
peters
eyes
had
traveled
to
the
closet
bereft
of
its
door
are
you
the
young
lady
he
demanded
gruffly
who
asked
me
to
have
that
door
taken
off
its
hinges
no
said
patty
i
think
that
must
have
been
my
it
was
heavy
she
continued
plaintively
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
getting
it
down
but
of
course
we
realized
that
you
were
awfully
busy
and
that
it
really
was
your
fault
that
what
i
wanted
the
for
she
added
i
sorry
that
i
did
get
it
back
last
night
but
i
was
very
tired
and
i
forgot
illustration
men
know
such
a
lot
about
such
things
peters
merely
grunted
he
was
examining
a
corner
cabinet
hanging
on
the
wall
did
you
know
he
asked
severely
that
it
against
the
rules
to
put
nails
in
the
plaster
those
are
nails
expostulated
patty
they
hooks
i
remembered
that
you
did
like
holes
so
i
only
put
in
two
though
i
am
really
afraid
that
three
are
necessary
what
do
you
think
peters
does
it
seem
solid
peters
shook
it
it
solid
enough
he
said
sulkily
as
he
turned
his
eye
fell
on
the
table
in
priscilla
bedroom
is
that
a
in
there
he
demanded
patty
shrugged
her
shoulders
an
apology
for
one
be
peters
get
against
that
bookcase
it
just
painted
peters
jumped
aside
and
stood
like
the
colossus
of
rhodes
with
one
foot
on
one
and
the
other
on
another
three
feet
away
it
is
hard
for
even
a
janitor
to
be
dignified
in
such
a
position
and
while
he
was
gathering
his
scattered
impressions
patty
looked
longingly
around
the
room
for
some
one
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
with
her
she
felt
that
the
silence
was
becoming
ominous
however
and
she
hastened
to
interrupt
it
there
something
wrong
with
that
stove
it
wo
burn
a
bit
i
am
afraid
we
did
put
it
together
just
right
i
should
be
surprised
if
might
be
able
to
tell
what
the
matter
with
it
mr
peters
she
smiled
sweetly
men
know
such
a
lot
about
such
things
would
you
mind
looking
at
it
peters
grunted
again
but
he
approached
the
stove
five
minutes
later
when
priscilla
stuck
her
head
in
to
find
out
if
by
chance
anything
remained
of
patty
she
saw
peters
on
his
knees
on
the
floor
of
her
bedroom
with
the
dismembered
stove
scattered
about
him
and
heard
him
saying
i
do
know
as
i
have
any
call
to
report
you
for
i
since
they
up
they
might
as
well
stay
and
voice
returning
you
kind
peters
of
course
if
priscilla
shut
the
door
softly
and
retired
around
the
corner
to
await
peters
departure
how
in
the
world
did
you
manage
him
she
asked
bursting
in
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
had
died
away
down
the
corridor
i
expected
to
sing
a
requiem
over
your
remains
and
i
found
peters
on
his
knees
engaged
in
amicable
conversation
patty
smiled
inscrutably
you
must
remember
she
said
that
peters
is
not
only
a
janitor
he
is
also
a
man
ii
an
early
fright
i
make
the
tea
said
patty
graciously
as
you
please
said
priscilla
with
a
skeptical
shrug
patty
bustled
about
amid
a
rattle
of
china
the
cups
are
rather
dusty
she
observed
dubiously
you
better
wash
them
priscilla
returned
no
said
patty
it
too
much
trouble
just
close
the
blinds
please
and
we
light
the
candles
and
that
will
do
as
well
come
in
she
called
in
answer
to
a
knock
georgie
merriles
lucille
carter
and
the
bartlet
twin
appeared
in
the
doorway
did
i
hear
the
two
p
were
going
to
serve
tea
this
afternoon
inquired
the
twin
yes
come
in
i
going
to
make
it
myself
answered
patty
and
see
how
much
more
attentive
a
hostess
i
am
than
priscilla
here
twin
she
added
you
take
the
kettle
out
and
fill
it
with
water
and
lucille
please
go
and
borrow
some
alcohol
from
the
freshmen
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
our
bottle
empty
i
do
it
myself
only
borrowed
such
a
lot
lately
and
they
do
know
you
you
see
and
oh
georgie
you
an
obliging
dear
just
run
to
the
store
and
get
some
sugar
i
think
i
saw
some
money
in
that
silver
inkstand
on
priscilla
desk
we
got
some
sugar
objected
priscilla
i
bought
a
whole
pound
yesterday
no
my
lamb
we
have
got
it
any
more
i
lent
it
to
bonnie
connaught
last
night
just
hunt
around
for
the
spoons
she
added
i
think
i
saw
them
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
the
bookcase
behind
kipling
and
what
may
i
ask
are
going
to
do
inquired
priscilla
i
said
patty
oh
i
am
going
to
sit
in
the
and
preside
ten
minutes
later
the
company
being
disposed
about
the
room
on
cushions
and
the
party
well
under
way
it
was
discovered
that
there
were
no
lemons
are
you
sure
asked
patty
anxiously
not
one
said
priscilla
peering
into
the
stein
where
the
lemons
were
kept
i
said
georgie
refuse
to
go
to
the
store
again
no
matter
said
patty
graciously
we
can
do
very
well
without
them
she
did
not
take
lemon
herself
the
object
of
tea
is
not
for
the
sake
of
the
tea
but
for
the
conversation
which
accompanies
it
and
one
must
not
let
accidents
annoy
him
you
see
young
ladies
she
went
on
in
the
tone
of
an
instructor
giving
a
lecture
though
i
have
just
spilled
the
alcohol
over
the
sugar
i
appear
not
to
notice
it
but
keep
up
an
easy
flow
of
conversation
to
divert
my
guests
a
repose
of
manner
is
above
all
things
to
be
cultivated
patty
leaned
languidly
back
in
her
chair
is
founder
day
she
resumed
in
a
conversational
tone
i
wonder
if
many
that
reminds
me
interrupted
the
twin
you
girls
need
save
any
dances
for
my
brother
i
got
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
saying
he
could
come
he
has
broken
anything
has
he
patty
asked
sympathetically
broken
anything
ah
an
arm
or
a
leg
or
a
neck
accidents
are
so
prevalent
about
founder
time
no
he
was
called
out
of
town
on
important
business
important
business
patty
laughed
dear
man
why
could
he
have
thought
of
something
new
i
think
myself
it
was
just
an
excuse
the
twin
acknowledged
he
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
he
would
be
the
only
man
here
and
that
alone
and
unaided
he
would
have
to
dance
with
all
six
hundred
girls
patty
shook
her
head
sadly
they
all
alike
founder
would
be
founder
if
half
the
guests
did
develop
serious
illness
or
important
business
or
dead
relations
the
last
minute
the
only
safe
way
is
to
invite
three
men
and
make
out
one
program
i
simply
ca
realize
that
is
founder
said
priscilla
it
does
seem
a
week
since
we
unpacked
our
trunks
after
vacation
and
before
we
know
it
we
shall
be
packing
them
again
for
christmas
yes
and
before
we
know
it
we
be
unpacking
them
again
with
examinations
three
weeks
ahead
said
georgie
the
pessimist
oh
for
the
matter
of
that
returned
patty
the
optimist
before
we
know
it
we
be
walking
up
one
side
of
the
platform
for
our
diplomas
and
coming
down
the
other
side
blooming
alumnæ
and
then
sighed
georgie
before
we
even
have
time
to
decide
on
a
career
we
be
old
ladies
telling
our
grandchildren
to
stand
up
straight
and
remember
their
rubbers
and
said
priscilla
before
any
of
us
get
any
tea
we
be
in
our
graves
if
you
do
stop
talking
and
watch
that
kettle
it
boiling
said
patty
yes
said
priscilla
it
been
boiling
for
ten
minutes
it
hot
said
patty
i
should
think
it
might
be
said
priscilla
and
now
the
problem
is
how
to
get
it
off
without
burning
one
self
you
presiding
you
must
solve
your
own
problems
is
an
easy
matter
and
patty
hooked
it
off
on
the
end
of
a
young
ladies
she
said
with
a
wave
of
the
kettle
there
is
nothing
like
a
college
education
to
teach
you
a
way
out
of
every
difficulty
if
when
you
are
out
in
the
wide
wide
world
where
oh
where
are
the
grave
old
seniors
chanted
the
twin
where
oh
where
are
they
the
rest
took
it
up
and
patty
waited
patiently
they
gone
out
of
cairnsley
ethics
they
gone
out
of
cairnsley
ethics
they
gone
out
of
cairnsley
ethics
into
the
wide
wide
if
you
have
finished
your
ovation
young
ladies
i
will
proceed
with
my
lecture
when
as
i
say
you
are
out
in
the
wide
wide
world
making
tea
some
afternoon
for
one
of
the
young
men
popularly
supposed
to
be
there
who
have
dropped
in
to
make
an
afternoon
call
do
you
follow
me
young
ladies
or
do
i
speak
too
fast
if
while
you
are
engaged
in
conversation
the
kettle
should
become
too
hot
do
not
put
your
finger
in
your
mouth
and
shriek
and
coquettishly
say
to
the
young
man
take
it
off
as
might
a
young
woman
who
has
not
enjoyed
your
advantages
but
rather
rise
to
the
emergency
say
to
him
calmly
kettle
has
become
may
i
trouble
you
to
go
into
the
hall
and
bring
an
umbrella
and
when
he
returns
you
can
hook
it
off
gracefully
and
expeditiously
as
you
have
seen
me
do
young
ladies
and
the
young
patty
take
care
this
from
priscilla
in
a
wail
this
from
georgie
patty
hastily
set
the
kettle
down
on
the
floor
i
awfully
sorry
georgie
does
it
hurt
not
in
the
least
it
really
a
pleasant
sensation
to
have
boiling
water
poured
over
you
the
bartlet
twin
sniffed
i
smell
burning
rug
patty
groaned
i
resign
pris
i
resign
here
you
preside
i
never
ask
to
make
it
again
i
should
like
observed
the
twin
to
see
patty
entertaining
a
young
man
it
not
such
an
unprecedented
event
said
patty
with
some
warmth
you
can
watch
me
night
if
it
will
give
you
so
much
pleasure
night
are
you
going
to
have
a
man
for
the
prom
that
said
patty
is
my
intention
and
you
have
asked
me
for
a
dance
this
in
an
aggrieved
chorus
from
the
entire
room
i
have
asked
any
one
said
patty
with
dignity
do
you
mean
you
going
to
have
all
of
the
twenty
dances
with
him
yourself
oh
no
i
do
expect
to
dance
more
than
ten
with
him
myself
i
have
made
out
his
card
yet
she
added
why
not
i
never
do
has
he
been
here
before
then
no
that
the
reason
the
reason
for
what
well
patty
deigned
to
explain
i
invited
him
for
every
party
since
freshman
year
and
did
he
decline
no
he
accepted
but
he
never
came
why
not
he
was
scared
scared
of
the
girls
yes
said
patty
partly
but
mostly
of
the
faculty
the
would
hurt
him
of
course
not
but
he
could
understand
that
you
see
he
had
a
fright
when
he
was
young
a
fright
what
was
it
well
said
patty
it
happened
this
way
it
was
while
i
was
at
he
was
at
andover
then
and
his
home
was
in
the
south
and
one
time
when
he
went
through
washington
he
stopped
off
to
call
on
me
as
it
happened
the
butler
had
left
two
days
before
and
had
taken
with
him
all
the
knives
and
forks
and
all
the
money
he
could
find
and
nancy
lee
gold
watch
and
two
and
my
silver
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
a
pie
she
enumerated
with
a
conscientious
regard
for
details
and
trent
that
the
principal
had
advertised
for
a
new
butler
i
should
have
thought
the
old
one
would
have
discouraged
her
from
keeping
butlers
said
georgie
you
think
so
said
patty
but
she
was
a
very
persevering
woman
on
the
day
that
raoul
that
his
name
came
to
call
nineteen
people
had
applied
for
the
place
and
trent
was
worn
out
from
interviewing
them
so
she
told
miss
sarah
that
her
daughter
to
attend
to
those
who
came
in
the
evening
miss
sarah
was
tall
and
wore
spectacles
and
was
was
a
good
disciplinarian
suggested
the
twin
yes
said
patty
feelingly
an
good
disciplinarian
well
when
raoul
got
there
he
gave
his
card
to
ellen
and
asked
for
me
but
ellen
did
understand
and
she
called
miss
sarah
and
when
miss
sarah
saw
him
in
his
evening
clothes
she
took
him
for
a
butler
put
in
georgie
yes
she
took
him
for
a
butler
and
she
looked
at
the
card
he
given
ellen
and
said
icily
does
this
mean
it
my
name
he
stammered
see
said
miss
sarah
where
is
your
recommendation
did
know
it
was
necessary
he
said
terribly
scared
course
it
necessary
miss
sarah
returned
ca
allow
you
to
come
into
the
house
unless
i
have
letters
from
the
places
where
been
before
did
suppose
you
were
so
strict
he
said
have
to
be
strict
miss
sarah
answered
firmly
you
had
much
experience
he
did
know
what
she
meant
but
he
thought
it
would
be
safest
to
say
he
had
of
course
you
wo
do
she
replied
old
are
you
he
was
so
frightened
by
this
time
that
he
could
remember
he
gasped
mean
twenty
miss
sarah
saw
his
confusion
and
thought
he
had
designs
on
some
of
the
heiresses
intrusted
to
her
care
do
see
how
you
to
come
here
she
said
severely
should
not
think
of
having
you
in
the
house
for
a
moment
you
altogether
too
young
and
too
and
with
that
raoul
got
up
and
bolted
when
ellen
told
miss
sarah
the
next
day
that
he
asked
for
me
she
was
terribly
mortified
and
she
made
me
write
and
explain
and
invite
him
to
dinner
but
wild
horses
could
have
dragged
him
into
the
house
again
he
been
afraid
to
stop
off
in
washington
ever
since
he
always
goes
straight
through
on
a
sleeper
and
says
he
has
nightmares
even
then
and
is
that
why
he
wo
come
to
the
college
yes
said
patty
that
the
reason
i
told
him
we
did
have
any
butlers
here
but
he
said
we
had
lady
faculty
and
that
as
bad
but
i
thought
you
said
he
coming
to
the
prom
he
is
this
time
are
you
sure
yes
said
patty
with
ominous
emphasis
i
sure
he
knows
she
added
what
will
happen
if
he
does
what
will
happen
asked
the
twin
nothing
the
twin
shook
her
head
and
georgie
inquired
then
why
do
you
make
out
his
program
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
i
did
do
it
before
because
it
sort
of
seemed
like
tempting
providence
i
did
want
to
be
the
cause
of
any
really
accident
happening
to
him
she
explained
a
trifle
ambiguously
as
she
got
out
pencil
and
paper
what
dances
can
you
give
me
lucille
and
you
georgie
have
you
got
the
third
taken
while
this
business
was
being
settled
a
knock
unheeded
had
sounded
on
the
door
it
came
again
what
that
asked
priscilla
did
some
one
knock
come
in
the
door
opened
and
a
maid
stood
upon
the
threshold
with
a
yellow
envelop
in
her
hand
she
peered
uncertainly
around
the
darkened
room
from
one
face
to
another
miss
patty
wyatt
she
asked
patty
stretched
out
her
hand
in
silence
for
the
envelop
and
propping
it
up
on
her
desk
looked
at
it
with
a
grim
smile
what
is
it
patty
are
you
going
to
read
it
there
no
need
i
know
what
it
says
then
i
read
it
said
priscilla
ripping
it
open
is
it
a
leg
or
an
arm
patty
inquired
with
mild
curiosity
neither
said
priscilla
it
a
oh
murmured
patty
what
is
it
demanded
georgie
the
curious
read
it
out
loud
new
haven
november
broke
playing
honest
injun
terribly
sorry
better
luck
next
time
raoul
there
will
not
observed
patty
a
next
time
iii
the
impressionable
todhunter
has
the
mail
been
around
yet
called
priscilla
to
a
girl
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
do
believe
so
it
has
been
in
our
room
there
she
comes
now
and
priscilla
swooped
down
upon
the
got
anything
for
do
you
want
miss
wyatt
mail
too
yes
i
take
everything
what
a
lot
is
that
all
for
us
and
priscilla
walked
down
the
corridor
swinging
her
by
its
and
opening
envelops
as
she
went
she
was
presently
joined
by
georgie
merriles
likewise
swinging
a
by
a
hello
pris
going
to
english
want
me
to
help
carry
your
mail
thank
you
said
priscilla
you
may
keep
the
most
of
it
now
that
she
added
holding
out
a
blue
envelop
is
an
advertisement
for
cold
cream
which
no
lady
should
be
without
and
that
holding
out
a
yellow
envelop
is
an
advertisement
for
beef
extract
which
no
should
be
without
and
that
holding
out
a
white
envelop
is
the
worst
of
all
because
it
looks
like
a
legitimate
letter
and
it
nothing
but
a
madam
thing
telling
me
my
tailor
has
moved
from
to
street
and
hopes
i
continue
to
favor
him
with
my
patronage
and
here
she
went
on
turning
to
her
correspondence
is
a
and
a
letter
for
patty
and
one
from
yale
that
probably
raoul
explaining
why
he
could
come
to
the
prom
it
wo
do
any
good
though
no
mortal
man
can
ever
make
her
believe
he
did
have
his
broken
on
purpose
and
i
do
know
whom
that
from
priscilla
continued
examining
the
last
letter
marked
a
new
york
never
heard
of
it
did
you
never
saw
the
writing
before
either
georgie
laughed
do
you
keep
tab
on
all
of
patty
correspondents
oh
i
know
the
most
of
them
by
this
time
she
usually
reads
the
interesting
ones
out
loud
and
the
ones
that
are
interesting
she
never
answers
so
they
stop
writing
hurry
up
the
bell
going
to
ring
and
they
pushed
in
among
the
crowd
of
girls
on
the
steps
of
the
the
bell
did
ring
just
as
they
reached
the
and
priscilla
dropped
the
letters
without
comment
into
patty
lap
as
she
went
past
patty
was
reading
poetry
and
did
not
look
up
she
had
assimilated
some
ten
pages
of
shelley
since
the
first
bell
rang
and
as
she
was
not
sure
which
would
be
taken
up
in
class
she
was
now
swallowing
wordsworth
in
the
same
voracious
manner
patty
method
in
romantic
poetry
was
to
be
very
fresh
on
the
first
part
of
the
lesson
catch
the
instructor
eye
early
in
the
hour
make
a
brilliant
recitation
and
pass
the
remainder
of
the
time
in
gentle
meditation
however
the
unwonted
bulk
of
her
correspondence
diverted
her
mind
from
its
immediate
duty
she
failed
to
catch
the
instructor
eye
and
the
recitation
proceeded
without
her
assistance
priscilla
watched
her
from
the
back
seat
as
she
read
the
yale
letter
with
a
skeptical
frown
and
made
a
grimace
over
the
blue
and
the
yellow
but
before
she
had
reached
the
hotel
a
priscilla
was
paying
attention
to
the
recitation
again
it
was
coming
her
way
and
she
was
anxiously
forming
an
opinion
on
the
essential
characteristics
of
wordsworth
view
of
immortality
suddenly
the
room
was
startled
by
an
audible
titter
from
patty
who
hastily
composed
her
face
and
assumed
a
look
of
vacuous
innocence
but
too
late
she
had
caught
the
instructor
eye
at
last
miss
wyatt
what
do
you
consider
the
most
serious
limitations
of
our
author
miss
wyatt
blinked
once
or
twice
this
question
out
of
its
context
was
not
illuminating
it
was
a
part
of
her
philosophy
however
never
to
flunk
flat
she
always
crawled
well
she
began
with
an
air
of
profound
deliberation
that
question
might
be
considered
in
two
ways
either
from
an
artistic
or
a
philosophic
standpoint
this
sounded
promising
and
the
instructor
smiled
encouragingly
yes
she
said
and
yet
continued
patty
after
still
profounder
deliberation
i
think
the
same
reason
will
be
found
to
be
the
ultimate
explanation
of
both
the
instructor
might
have
inquired
both
what
but
she
refrained
and
merely
waited
patty
thought
she
had
done
enough
but
she
plunged
on
desperately
in
spite
of
his
really
deep
philosophy
we
notice
a
certain
one
might
almost
say
about
his
poetry
and
a
lack
of
er
meditation
which
i
should
attribute
to
his
immaturity
and
his
a
rather
wild
life
if
he
had
lived
longer
i
think
he
might
have
overcome
it
in
time
the
class
looked
dazed
and
the
corners
of
the
instructor
mouth
twitched
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
point
of
view
miss
wyatt
and
as
far
as
i
know
entirely
original
as
they
were
crowding
out
at
the
end
of
the
recitation
priscilla
pounced
upon
patty
what
on
earth
were
you
saying
about
wordsworth
youth
and
immaturity
she
demanded
the
man
lived
to
be
over
eighty
and
composed
a
poem
with
his
last
gasp
wordsworth
i
was
talking
about
shelley
well
the
class
was
how
should
i
know
patty
demanded
indignantly
she
said
author
and
i
avoided
specific
details
as
long
as
i
could
oh
patty
patty
and
you
said
he
was
wild
the
lamblike
wordsworth
what
were
you
laughing
at
anyway
demanded
georgie
patty
smiled
again
why
she
said
unfolding
the
hotel
a
letter
it
from
an
englishman
todhunter
some
one
my
father
discovered
last
summer
and
invited
out
to
stay
with
us
for
a
few
days
i
forgotten
all
about
him
and
here
he
writes
to
know
whether
and
when
he
may
call
and
if
so
will
it
be
convenient
for
him
to
come
that
a
comprehensive
sentence
is
it
his
train
gets
in
at
five
and
he
be
out
about
six
he
is
going
to
take
any
chances
said
priscilla
no
said
patty
but
i
do
mind
i
invited
him
to
come
out
to
dinner
some
night
though
i
forgotten
it
he
really
very
nice
and
in
spite
of
what
the
funny
papers
say
about
englishmen
quite
entertaining
intentionally
or
unintentionally
inquired
georgie
both
said
patty
what
he
doing
in
america
asked
priscilla
not
writing
a
book
on
the
american
girl
i
hope
not
quite
as
bad
as
that
said
patty
he
corresponding
for
a
newspaper
though
she
smiled
dreamily
he
very
curious
about
college
patty
i
you
were
not
guilty
of
trying
to
make
an
englishman
a
guest
in
your
father
house
believe
any
of
your
absurd
fabrications
of
course
not
said
patty
i
was
most
careful
in
everything
i
told
him
but
she
acknowledged
he
he
gets
impressions
easily
it
is
easy
to
get
impressions
when
one
is
talking
with
you
observed
georgie
he
asked
me
patty
continued
ignoring
this
remark
what
we
studied
in
college
but
i
remembered
that
he
was
an
alien
in
a
foreign
land
and
i
curbed
my
natural
instincts
and
outlined
the
courses
in
the
catalogue
verbatim
and
i
explained
the
different
methods
of
instruction
and
described
the
library
and
laboratories
and
was
he
impressed
asked
priscilla
yes
said
patty
i
think
you
might
almost
say
dazed
he
asked
me
apologetically
if
we
ever
did
anything
to
relieve
the
strain
had
any
amusements
you
know
and
i
said
oh
yes
we
had
a
browning
and
an
ibsen
club
and
we
sometimes
gave
greek
tragedies
in
the
original
he
was
positively
afraid
to
come
near
me
again
for
fear
i
forget
and
talk
to
him
in
greek
instead
of
english
in
view
of
the
facts
patty
friends
considered
this
last
remark
distinctly
humorous
for
she
had
flunked
her
freshman
greek
three
times
and
had
been
advised
by
the
faculty
to
take
it
over
sophomore
year
i
hope
since
he
a
newspaper
writer
said
priscilla
that
you
do
something
to
lighten
his
impression
or
he
never
favor
colleges
in
england
i
had
thought
of
that
said
patty
perhaps
i
ought
they
had
reached
the
steps
of
the
dormitory
let
not
go
in
said
georgie
let
go
down
to
muldoon
and
get
some
chocolate
cake
thank
you
said
priscilla
i
in
training
soup
then
ca
eat
between
meals
you
come
then
patty
sorry
but
i
got
to
take
my
white
dress
down
to
the
laundry
and
have
it
pressed
are
you
going
to
dress
up
for
him
to
the
extent
of
evening
clothes
yes
said
patty
i
think
i
owe
it
to
the
american
girl
well
sighed
georgie
i
hungry
but
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
go
in
and
dress
that
doll
for
the
college
settlement
association
the
mine
done
said
priscilla
and
patty
would
take
one
did
you
see
bonnie
connaught
sitting
on
the
back
seat
in
biology
this
morning
hemming
her
doll
petticoat
straight
through
the
lecture
really
laughed
patty
it
a
good
thing
professor
the
college
settlement
association
by
way
of
parenthesis
was
in
the
habit
of
distributing
three
hundred
dolls
among
the
students
every
year
before
christmas
to
be
dressed
and
sent
to
the
settlement
in
new
york
the
dolls
were
supposed
to
be
so
well
dressed
that
the
east
side
mothers
could
use
them
as
models
for
the
clothing
of
their
own
children
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
tendency
among
the
girls
was
to
strive
for
effect
and
not
for
detail
on
the
evening
before
the
dolls
were
to
be
shipped
a
doll
show
was
regularly
held
at
which
two
cents
admittance
was
charged
stamps
accepted
to
pay
the
expressage
it
was
ten
minutes
past
six
and
phillips
hall
such
of
it
as
was
not
late
was
dining
when
the
maid
arrived
with
algernon
vivian
todhunter
card
patty
radiant
in
a
white
evening
gown
was
trying
with
much
squirming
to
fasten
it
in
the
middle
of
the
back
oh
sadie
she
called
to
the
maid
would
you
mind
coming
in
here
and
buttoning
my
dress
i
ca
reach
it
from
above
or
below
you
look
just
beautiful
miss
wyatt
said
sadie
admiringly
patty
laughed
do
you
think
i
can
uphold
the
honor
of
the
nation
to
be
sure
miss
said
sadie
politely
patty
ran
down
the
corridor
to
the
door
of
the
and
then
swept
slowly
in
with
what
she
called
an
air
of
continental
repose
the
room
was
empty
she
glanced
about
in
some
surprise
for
she
knew
that
the
two
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
were
being
used
for
the
doll
show
she
tiptoed
over
and
peered
in
through
the
door
the
room
was
filled
with
dolls
in
rows
and
tiers
every
piece
of
furniture
was
covered
with
them
and
in
a
far
corner
at
the
end
of
a
long
vista
of
dolls
appeared
algernon
vivian
todhunter
gingerly
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
surrounded
by
baby
dolls
and
awkwardly
holding
in
his
lap
the
three
he
had
displaced
patty
drew
back
behind
the
door
and
spent
fully
three
minutes
in
regaining
her
continental
repose
then
she
entered
the
room
and
greeted
todhunter
effusively
he
carefully
transferred
the
dolls
to
his
left
arm
and
stood
up
and
shook
hands
let
me
take
the
little
dears
said
patty
kindly
i
afraid
in
your
way
todhunter
murmured
something
about
its
being
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
to
hold
them
patty
plumped
up
their
clothes
and
rearranged
them
on
the
sofa
with
motherly
solicitude
while
todhunter
watched
her
gravely
his
national
politeness
and
his
reportorial
instinct
each
struggling
for
the
mastery
finally
he
began
tentatively
i
say
miss
wyatt
do
er
the
young
ladies
spend
much
time
playing
with
dolls
no
said
patty
candidly
i
do
think
you
could
say
they
spend
much
i
have
never
heard
of
but
one
girl
actually
neglecting
her
work
for
it
you
must
think
that
we
have
as
many
dolls
as
this
here
night
she
went
on
it
is
rather
an
unusual
occurrence
once
a
year
the
girls
hold
what
they
call
a
doll
show
to
see
who
has
dressed
her
doll
the
best
ah
i
see
said
todhunter
a
little
friendly
rivalry
purely
friendly
said
patty
as
they
started
for
the
todhunter
adjusted
his
monocle
and
took
a
parting
look
at
the
doll
show
i
afraid
you
think
us
childish
todhunter
said
patty
not
at
all
miss
wyatt
he
assured
her
hastily
i
think
it
quite
charming
you
know
and
so
er
unexpected
i
had
always
been
told
that
they
played
somewhat
peculiar
games
at
these
women
colleges
but
i
never
supposed
they
did
anything
so
feminine
as
to
play
with
dolls
illustration
algernon
vivian
todhunter
gingerly
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
when
patty
returned
to
her
room
that
night
she
found
georgie
and
priscilla
surrounded
by
grammars
and
dictionaries
doing
german
prose
her
appearance
was
hailed
with
a
cry
of
indignant
protest
when
have
a
man
said
priscilla
i
divide
him
up
among
my
friends
when
he
a
curiosity
added
georgie
and
we
dressed
up
in
grand
clothes
and
stood
in
your
way
coming
out
of
chapel
went
on
priscilla
and
you
never
even
looked
at
us
englishmen
are
so
bashful
apologized
patty
i
did
want
to
frighten
him
priscilla
looked
at
her
suspiciously
patty
i
hope
you
did
impose
on
the
poor
man
credulity
certainly
not
said
patty
with
dignity
i
explained
everything
he
asked
me
and
was
most
careful
not
to
exaggerate
but
she
added
with
engaging
frankness
i
can
not
be
responsible
for
any
he
may
have
obtained
when
an
englishman
once
gets
an
idea
you
know
almost
impossible
to
change
it
iv
a
question
of
ethics
patty
methods
were
the
result
of
a
wide
experience
in
the
professorial
type
of
mind
by
her
senior
year
she
had
reduced
the
matter
of
recitation
to
a
system
and
could
foretell
with
unvarying
precision
the
day
she
would
be
called
on
and
the
question
she
would
be
asked
her
tactics
varied
with
the
subject
and
the
instructor
and
were
the
result
of
a
penetration
and
knowledge
of
human
nature
that
might
have
accomplished
something
in
a
worthier
cause
in
chemistry
for
example
her
instructor
was
a
man
who
had
outlived
any
early
illusions
in
regard
to
the
superior
conscientiousness
of
girls
over
boys
he
was
not
by
nature
a
suspicious
person
but
a
long
experience
in
teaching
had
inculcated
an
inordinate
wariness
which
was
sometimes
out
of
season
he
allowed
no
napping
in
his
classes
and
those
who
did
not
pay
attention
suffered
patty
discovered
his
weakness
early
in
the
year
and
planned
her
campaign
accordingly
as
long
as
she
did
not
understand
the
experiment
in
hand
she
would
watch
him
with
a
face
beaming
with
intelligence
but
when
she
did
understand
and
wished
to
recite
she
would
let
her
eyes
wander
to
the
window
with
a
dreamy
smile
and
being
asked
a
question
would
come
back
to
the
realities
of
chemistry
with
a
start
and
after
a
moment
of
ostentatious
pondering
make
a
brilliant
recitation
it
must
be
confessed
that
her
moments
of
abstraction
were
rare
she
was
far
too
often
radiantly
interested
in
french
her
tactics
were
exactly
opposite
the
instructor
with
all
the
native
politeness
of
his
race
called
on
those
only
who
caught
his
eye
and
appeared
willing
and
anxious
to
recite
this
made
the
matter
comparatively
simple
but
still
required
considerable
finesse
patty
dropped
her
pen
spilled
the
pages
from
her
tied
her
and
even
sneezed
opportunely
in
order
not
to
catch
his
eye
at
inconvenient
moments
the
rest
of
the
class
who
were
not
artists
contented
themselves
with
merely
lowering
their
eyes
as
he
looked
along
the
line
a
method
which
in
patty
scornful
estimation
said
as
plainly
as
words
please
do
call
on
me
i
do
know
but
with
professor
cairnsley
who
taught
philosophy
it
was
more
difficult
to
form
a
working
hypothesis
he
had
grown
old
in
the
service
of
the
college
and
after
thirty
years
experience
of
he
was
still
as
unsuspiciously
trustful
as
he
had
been
in
the
beginning
taking
it
for
granted
that
his
pupils
were
as
interested
in
the
contemplation
of
philosophic
truths
as
he
himself
the
professor
conducted
his
recitations
without
a
suspicion
of
guile
and
based
his
procedure
entirely
upon
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
the
key
to
his
method
had
always
remained
a
mystery
and
several
generations
of
classes
had
searched
for
it
in
vain
some
averred
that
he
called
on
every
seventh
girl
others
that
he
drew
lots
patty
triumphantly
announced
early
in
the
course
that
she
had
discovered
the
secret
at
last
that
on
monday
he
called
on
the
girls
on
tuesday
those
with
yellow
hair
on
wednesday
and
thursday
those
with
brown
and
on
friday
those
with
black
but
this
solution
like
the
others
was
found
to
break
down
in
actual
practice
and
patty
for
one
discovered
that
it
required
all
her
ingenuity
and
even
a
good
deal
of
studying
to
maintain
her
reputation
for
brilliancy
in
professor
cairnsley
classes
and
she
cared
about
maintaining
it
for
she
liked
the
professor
and
was
one
of
his
favorite
pupils
she
had
known
his
wife
before
she
entered
college
and
she
often
called
upon
them
in
their
home
and
in
short
exemplified
the
ideal
relations
between
faculty
and
students
owing
to
the
pressure
of
many
interests
patty
researches
into
philosophy
were
not
as
deep
as
the
intentions
of
the
course
but
she
had
a
very
good
working
knowledge
which
in
its
details
would
have
astonished
professor
cairnsley
could
he
have
got
behind
the
scenes
though
her
knowledge
was
not
based
strictly
on
the
her
reputation
in
the
class
was
good
and
as
patty
admitted
with
a
sigh
it
a
great
strain
on
the
imagination
to
keep
up
a
reputation
in
philosophy
it
had
been
established
indeed
as
far
back
as
her
sophomore
year
when
the
psychology
class
was
awed
into
silence
by
its
first
introduction
to
the
abstractions
of
science
and
patty
alone
had
dared
to
lift
her
voice
the
professor
one
morning
had
been
placidly
lecturing
along
on
the
subject
of
sensation
and
in
the
course
of
the
lecture
had
remarked
it
is
probable
that
the
individual
experiences
all
the
primary
sensations
during
the
first
few
months
of
infancy
and
that
in
after
life
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
new
sensation
professor
cairnsley
patty
piped
up
did
you
ever
shoot
the
chutes
the
ice
was
broken
at
last
and
the
class
felt
at
home
even
in
the
somewhat
deep
waters
of
philosophy
and
patty
however
undeservedly
had
gained
the
credit
of
having
a
deeper
insight
than
most
into
matters
psychical
and
so
into
her
senior
year
when
she
entered
upon
the
study
of
ethics
she
carried
along
an
unearned
and
fragile
reputation
built
upon
subterfuges
and
likely
to
crumble
at
the
slightest
touch
she
had
maintained
it
very
creditably
up
to
the
christmas
vacation
and
had
argued
upon
the
ultimate
ground
of
moral
obligation
and
the
origin
of
conscience
quite
as
intelligently
as
though
she
had
previously
read
what
the
had
to
say
on
the
subject
but
when
they
had
commenced
the
study
of
specific
theologies
based
upon
definite
historical
facts
patty
found
her
imagination
of
little
use
and
on
several
occasions
it
had
been
purely
good
luck
that
had
saved
her
from
exposure
once
the
bell
had
rung
at
an
opportune
moment
and
twice
she
had
been
able
to
avert
a
direct
answer
by
leading
the
discussion
into
side
issues
she
realized
however
that
fortune
would
not
always
favor
her
and
as
the
professor
usually
forgot
to
call
the
roll
she
formed
the
nefarious
practice
of
cutting
class
when
she
did
not
have
her
lesson
for
a
week
or
so
in
particular
her
pressure
of
work
in
other
directions
not
all
of
them
scholastic
had
prevented
her
from
devoting
her
usual
amount
of
energy
to
the
task
of
maintaining
her
philosophy
reputation
and
she
had
without
conscience
cut
ethics
several
days
in
succession
and
had
failed
to
comment
upon
the
fact
to
the
professor
what
did
he
lecture
about
in
ethics
those
recitations
i
missed
she
inquired
of
priscilla
one
afternoon
swedenborg
swedenborg
repeated
patty
dreamily
he
got
up
a
new
religion
did
he
or
was
it
a
new
system
of
gymnastics
i
heard
about
him
but
i
do
seem
to
remember
any
details
you
better
make
him
up
he
important
i
dare
say
but
i
lived
years
without
knowing
about
him
and
i
can
wait
a
month
longer
i
saving
up
confucius
and
the
jesuits
for
and
i
add
swedenborg
to
the
list
you
better
not
professor
cairnsley
fond
of
him
and
is
likely
to
pop
a
special
examination
at
any
moment
not
professor
cairnsley
laughed
patty
he
does
want
to
waste
the
time
he
going
to
lecture
straight
on
for
two
weeks
nice
man
i
see
it
in
his
eye
what
i
admire
in
a
professor
is
a
good
steady
plodding
disposition
that
does
go
in
for
sensational
surprises
you
find
yourself
mistaken
some
day
warned
priscilla
no
danger
my
dear
cassandra
i
know
professor
cairnsley
and
professor
cairnsley
thinks
he
knows
me
and
we
just
get
along
together
beautifully
i
wish
there
were
more
like
him
patty
added
with
a
sigh
professor
cairnsley
began
a
lecture
the
next
morning
which
was
evidently
calculated
to
extend
through
the
hour
and
patty
cast
a
triumphant
glance
at
priscilla
as
she
unscrewed
the
top
of
her
and
settled
down
to
work
in
the
course
of
the
lecture
however
he
had
occasion
to
refer
to
swedenborg
and
pausing
a
moment
he
casually
asked
a
girl
on
the
front
seat
for
a
résumé
of
swedenborg
philosophy
she
unfortunately
confusing
him
with
schopenhauer
glibly
attributed
to
him
doctrines
which
would
have
outraged
his
soul
could
he
have
heard
them
it
is
written
that
the
worm
will
turn
and
the
professor
bland
smile
deserted
him
as
he
passed
the
question
to
a
second
girl
without
much
better
result
the
class
in
general
had
evidently
been
laboring
under
patty
delusion
that
the
time
had
not
come
in
which
to
learn
back
notes
amazed
and
indignant
he
pursued
the
matter
with
a
persistency
and
a
rancor
he
seldom
showed
he
began
going
straight
through
the
class
growing
more
and
more
sarcastic
with
each
recitation
as
she
saw
him
finish
with
the
row
in
front
and
begin
on
her
row
patty
knew
that
she
was
doomed
she
racked
her
brain
for
some
memory
of
swedenborg
he
was
a
name
to
her
and
nothing
more
he
might
have
been
an
ancient
greek
or
a
modern
american
for
all
she
knew
as
professor
cairnsley
came
along
the
line
he
was
gradually
eliciting
from
the
terrified
class
the
superficial
points
which
were
more
or
less
common
to
all
philosophers
patty
perceived
that
her
imagination
could
not
help
her
out
that
for
once
the
placid
professor
was
on
the
and
that
swedenborg
and
nothing
but
swedenborg
would
serve
she
cast
an
agonized
glance
up
at
priscilla
and
priscilla
grinned
back
with
i
told
you
so
written
on
every
feature
patty
looked
about
desperately
the
was
shaped
like
an
amphitheater
with
part
of
the
seats
on
a
level
with
the
main
floor
and
the
rest
rising
in
tiers
patty
sat
on
the
main
floor
well
toward
the
rear
she
could
barely
see
the
professor
head
but
he
was
coming
irrevocably
she
did
not
have
to
see
very
clearly
to
know
that
the
girl
before
her
answered
wildly
the
professor
frowned
and
looking
down
at
his
slowly
and
deliberately
made
a
zero
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
patty
seat
was
empty
she
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
with
her
head
bowed
behind
the
girl
in
front
the
unconscious
professor
passed
over
her
bent
head
and
called
on
the
girl
on
the
other
side
who
coughed
hysterically
once
or
twice
and
flunked
flat
and
while
he
was
crediting
the
fact
in
his
patty
resumed
her
seat
a
ripple
of
laughter
ran
around
the
room
the
professor
frowned
and
remarked
that
he
saw
no
occasion
for
amusement
the
bell
rang
and
the
class
somewhat
sheepishly
filed
out
that
afternoon
patty
burst
into
the
study
where
priscilla
and
georgie
merriles
were
making
tea
did
you
ever
think
i
had
much
of
a
conscience
she
demanded
never
thought
it
was
your
strong
point
said
georgie
well
i
got
a
perfectly
tremendous
one
what
do
you
think
i
been
doing
making
up
your
ethics
lectures
suggested
priscilla
worse
than
that
you
been
to
gym
patty
said
georgie
goodness
no
i
not
so
far
gone
as
that
well
i
tell
you
i
met
professor
cairnsley
by
the
gate
and
walked
in
with
him
and
if
you
please
he
complimented
me
on
my
work
in
ethics
that
ought
to
have
been
embarrassing
said
georgie
it
was
acknowledged
patty
i
told
him
i
did
really
know
as
much
as
he
thought
i
did
what
did
he
say
he
said
i
was
too
modest
he
such
a
trustful
old
man
you
know
that
you
sort
of
hate
to
deceive
him
and
what
do
you
think
i
told
him
about
the
seat
priscilla
smiled
approvingly
upon
her
usually
recreant
well
patty
you
certainly
are
better
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
thank
you
murmured
patty
i
begin
to
believe
you
got
a
conscience
said
georgie
an
excellent
one
said
patty
complacently
it
pays
in
the
end
said
priscilla
it
does
agreed
patty
professor
cairnsley
said
he
would
explain
swedenborg
to
me
himself
and
he
invited
me
over
to
dinner
v
the
elusive
kate
ferris
the
mysterious
kate
ferris
who
kept
priscilla
on
the
verge
of
nervous
prostration
for
a
whole
semester
entered
upon
her
college
career
in
an
entirely
unpremeditated
and
impromptu
manner
it
began
one
day
away
back
in
november
georgie
merriles
and
patty
had
just
strolled
home
from
the
athletic
field
where
they
had
been
witnessing
the
start
of
a
cross
country
in
which
priscilla
was
impersonating
a
fox
as
they
entered
the
study
georgie
stopped
to
examine
some
loose
sheets
of
paper
which
were
impaled
upon
the
door
what
this
patty
oh
that
the
for
the
german
club
secretary
you
know
and
every
one
who
wants
to
join
comes
here
the
study
has
been
so
full
of
freshmen
all
the
time
that
i
told
her
to
hang
it
on
the
door
and
let
them
join
outside
it
works
beautifully
patty
turned
the
leaves
and
ran
her
eyes
down
the
list
of
sprawling
signatures
it
a
popular
organization
is
it
the
freshmen
are
simply
scrambling
to
get
in
they
trying
to
show
fräulein
scherin
how
much
interest
they
take
in
the
subject
georgie
laughed
patty
picked
up
the
pencil
would
you
like
to
join
i
know
priscilla
would
be
gratified
no
thank
you
i
pay
club
dues
enough
already
i
afraid
i
not
exactly
eligible
myself
as
i
do
know
any
german
it
such
a
beautifully
sharp
pencil
though
that
i
hate
not
to
write
with
it
patty
poised
the
pencil
a
moment
and
abstractedly
traced
the
name
kate
ferris
georgie
laughed
if
there
should
happen
to
be
a
kate
ferris
in
college
she
would
be
surprised
to
find
herself
a
member
of
the
german
club
and
the
incident
was
forgotten
a
few
days
later
the
two
came
in
from
class
to
find
priscilla
and
the
president
of
the
german
club
sitting
on
the
divan
with
their
heads
together
frantically
turning
the
leaves
of
the
catalogue
she
is
a
sophomore
the
president
announced
she
be
a
freshman
priscilla
look
again
i
gone
over
this
list
three
times
and
there
is
a
single
ferris
down
georgie
and
patty
exchanged
glances
and
inquired
the
trouble
a
girl
named
kate
ferris
has
registered
for
the
german
club
and
gone
through
all
the
classes
and
there
simply
is
any
such
girl
in
college
possibly
a
special
patty
suggested
of
course
why
did
we
think
of
that
and
priscilla
turned
to
the
list
of
special
students
no
she
is
here
let
me
look
and
patty
ran
her
eyes
down
the
column
you
mistaken
the
name
she
remarked
handing
the
book
back
with
a
shrug
priscilla
produced
the
and
triumphantly
exhibited
an
unmistakable
kate
ferris
they
forgot
to
put
her
in
the
catalogue
i
never
knew
them
to
make
such
a
mistake
before
said
the
president
dubiously
i
do
believe
we
better
put
her
in
the
till
we
find
out
who
she
is
then
you
hurt
her
feelings
said
georgie
freshmen
are
terribly
sensitive
about
being
slighted
oh
very
well
it
does
matter
and
kate
ferris
was
accordingly
enrolled
in
the
club
records
several
weeks
later
priscilla
was
engaged
in
laboriously
turning
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
into
grammatical
german
and
as
she
closed
the
dictionary
and
grammar
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
remarked
to
patty
do
you
know
it
very
queer
about
that
kate
ferris
she
has
paid
her
dues
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
she
has
attended
a
single
meeting
would
you
take
her
name
off
the
roll
i
do
believe
in
college
any
more
you
might
as
well
said
patty
and
she
listlessly
watched
priscilla
as
she
scratched
out
the
name
with
a
penknife
patty
never
made
the
mistake
of
the
next
morning
as
priscilla
came
in
from
a
class
she
found
a
note
on
her
written
in
the
perpendicular
characters
of
kate
ferris
it
ran
dear
miss
pond
i
came
to
pay
my
german
club
dues
and
as
you
are
not
in
i
have
left
the
money
on
the
bookcase
am
sorry
to
have
missed
so
many
meetings
but
have
not
been
able
to
attend
classes
lately
kate
ferris
priscilla
exhibited
the
note
to
the
president
as
a
tangible
proof
that
kate
ferris
still
existed
and
reinscribed
the
name
in
the
a
few
weeks
later
she
found
a
second
note
on
her
dear
miss
pond
as
i
am
very
busy
with
my
class
work
i
find
that
i
have
not
time
to
attend
the
german
club
meetings
and
so
have
decided
to
resign
i
left
my
letter
of
resignation
on
the
bookcase
kate
ferris
as
priscilla
scratched
the
name
out
of
the
again
she
remarked
to
patty
i
am
glad
this
kate
ferris
has
left
the
club
at
last
she
has
caused
me
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
of
the
members
put
together
the
next
morning
a
third
note
appeared
on
the
block
dear
miss
pond
i
happened
to
mention
the
fact
of
my
having
resigned
from
the
german
club
to
fräulein
scherin
last
night
and
she
said
that
the
club
would
help
me
in
my
work
and
advised
me
to
stay
in
it
so
i
shall
be
much
obliged
if
you
will
not
present
my
letter
at
the
meeting
after
all
as
i
have
decided
to
follow
her
advice
kate
ferris
priscilla
tossed
the
note
to
patty
with
a
groan
and
getting
out
the
she
turned
to
the
f
and
reënrolled
kate
ferris
patty
sympathetically
watched
the
process
over
her
shoulder
the
book
is
getting
so
thin
in
that
spot
she
laughed
that
kate
ferris
is
actually
coming
through
on
the
other
side
if
she
changes
her
mind
many
more
times
there
wo
be
anything
left
i
going
to
ask
fräulein
scherin
about
her
priscilla
declared
she
made
me
so
much
trouble
that
i
curious
to
see
what
she
looks
like
she
did
ask
fräulein
scherin
but
fräulein
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
girl
i
have
so
many
freshmen
she
apologized
i
can
not
all
of
them
with
their
queer
names
remember
priscilla
inquired
about
kate
ferris
from
the
freshmen
she
knew
but
though
all
of
them
thought
that
the
name
sounded
familiar
none
of
them
could
exactly
place
her
she
was
variously
described
as
tall
and
dark
and
small
and
light
but
further
inquiry
always
proved
that
the
girl
they
had
in
mind
was
some
one
else
priscilla
kept
hearing
about
the
girl
on
all
sides
but
could
never
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
miss
ferris
called
several
times
on
business
but
priscilla
always
happened
to
be
out
her
name
was
posted
on
the
for
having
library
books
that
were
overdue
she
even
wrote
a
paper
for
one
of
the
german
club
meetings
georgie
was
not
a
facile
german
scholar
and
it
had
required
a
whole
saturday
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
she
was
suddenly
called
out
of
town
she
did
not
read
it
in
person
a
month
or
two
after
kate
ferris
advent
priscilla
had
friends
visiting
her
from
new
york
for
whom
she
gave
a
tea
in
the
study
i
am
going
to
invite
kate
ferris
she
announced
i
upon
finding
out
what
she
looks
like
do
said
patty
i
should
like
to
find
out
myself
the
invitation
was
despatched
and
on
the
next
day
priscilla
received
a
formal
acceptance
it
strange
that
she
should
send
an
acceptance
for
a
tea
she
remarked
as
she
read
it
but
i
glad
to
get
it
anyway
i
like
to
feel
sure
that
i
to
see
her
at
last
on
the
evening
of
the
tea
after
the
guests
had
gone
and
the
furniture
had
been
moved
back
the
weary
hostesses
in
somewhat
rumpled
evening
dresses
a
considerable
crush
results
when
fifty
are
entertained
in
a
room
whose
utmost
capacity
is
fifteen
were
reëntertaining
one
or
two
friends
on
the
lettuce
sandwiches
and
cakes
the
obliging
guests
had
failed
to
consume
the
company
and
the
clothes
having
passed
in
review
the
conversation
flagged
a
little
and
georgie
suddenly
asked
was
kate
ferris
here
i
was
so
busy
passing
cakes
that
i
did
look
and
i
wanted
to
see
her
especially
that
so
patty
exclaimed
i
did
see
her
either
she
the
most
abnormally
inconspicuous
person
i
ever
heard
of
what
did
she
look
like
pris
priscilla
knit
her
brows
she
could
have
come
i
kept
watching
for
her
all
the
evening
it
strange
is
it
when
she
was
so
careful
to
send
an
acceptance
i
growing
positively
morbid
over
the
girl
i
begin
to
think
she
invisible
i
begin
to
think
so
myself
said
patty
the
next
morning
mail
brought
a
bunch
of
violets
and
an
apology
from
kate
ferris
she
had
been
unavoidably
detained
it
positively
uncanny
priscilla
declared
i
shall
go
to
the
registrar
and
tell
her
that
this
kate
ferris
is
neither
down
in
the
catalogue
nor
the
college
directory
and
find
out
where
she
lives
do
do
anything
reckless
georgie
pleaded
take
what
the
gods
send
and
be
grateful
but
priscilla
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
she
returned
from
the
registrar
office
flushed
and
defiant
she
insists
that
there
any
such
person
in
college
and
that
i
must
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
name
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
absurd
that
seems
to
me
the
only
reasonable
explanation
patty
agreed
amicably
perhaps
it
is
harris
instead
of
ferris
priscilla
faced
her
ominously
you
read
the
name
yourself
it
was
as
plain
as
printing
we
all
liable
to
make
mistakes
patty
murmured
soothingly
do
you
know
said
georgie
i
begin
to
think
it
all
a
hallucination
and
that
there
really
is
any
kate
ferris
it
strange
of
course
but
not
any
stranger
than
some
of
those
cases
you
read
about
in
psychology
hallucinations
do
send
flowers
said
priscilla
hotly
and
she
stalked
out
of
the
room
leaving
patty
and
georgie
to
review
the
campaign
i
afraid
it
gone
far
enough
said
georgie
if
she
bothers
the
office
very
much
there
be
an
official
investigation
i
afraid
so
sighed
patty
it
been
very
entertaining
but
she
is
really
getting
sensitive
on
the
subject
and
i
do
dare
mention
kate
ferris
name
when
we
alone
shall
we
tell
her
patty
shook
her
head
not
just
now
i
should
dare
she
believes
in
corporal
punishment
a
few
days
later
priscilla
received
another
note
directed
in
the
hand
she
had
come
to
dread
she
threw
it
into
the
unopened
but
curiosity
prevailing
she
drew
it
out
again
and
read
it
dear
miss
pond
as
i
have
been
obliged
to
leave
college
on
account
of
my
health
i
inclose
my
resignation
to
the
german
club
i
thank
you
very
sincerely
for
your
kindness
to
me
this
year
and
shall
always
look
back
upon
our
friendship
as
one
of
the
happiest
memories
of
my
college
life
yours
sincerely
kate
ferris
when
patty
came
in
she
found
priscilla
silently
and
grimly
scratching
a
hole
into
the
where
kate
ferris
name
had
been
changed
her
mind
again
patty
asked
pleasantly
she
left
college
priscilla
snapped
and
do
you
ever
mention
her
name
to
me
again
patty
sighed
sympathetically
and
remarked
to
the
room
in
general
sort
of
pathetic
to
have
your
whole
college
life
summed
up
in
a
hole
in
the
german
club
archives
i
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
her
vi
a
story
with
four
sequels
it
was
saturday
and
patty
had
been
working
ever
since
breakfast
with
a
brief
pause
for
luncheon
on
a
paper
entitled
shakspere
the
man
at
four
she
laid
down
her
pen
pushed
her
manuscript
into
the
and
faced
her
defiantly
what
do
i
care
about
shakspere
the
man
he
been
dead
three
hundred
years
priscilla
laughed
unfeelingly
what
do
i
care
about
a
frog
nervous
system
for
the
matter
of
that
but
i
am
writing
an
interesting
monograph
on
it
just
the
same
ah
i
dare
say
you
are
making
a
valuable
addition
to
the
subject
it
quite
as
valuable
as
your
addition
to
shaksperiana
patty
dropped
a
voluble
sigh
and
turned
to
the
window
to
note
that
it
was
raining
dismally
oh
hand
it
in
said
priscilla
comfortingly
you
worked
on
it
all
day
and
it
probably
no
worse
than
the
most
of
your
things
no
sense
to
it
said
patty
they
used
to
that
laughed
priscilla
what
are
you
laughing
at
anyway
patty
asked
crossly
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
in
this
beastly
place
always
having
to
do
what
you
do
want
to
do
when
you
most
do
want
to
do
it
just
the
same
day
after
day
get
up
by
bells
eat
by
bells
sleep
by
bells
i
feel
like
some
sort
of
a
delinquent
living
in
an
asylum
priscilla
treated
this
outburst
with
the
silence
it
deserved
and
patty
turned
back
to
her
perusal
of
the
campus
i
wish
something
would
happen
she
said
discontentedly
i
think
put
on
a
mackintosh
and
go
out
in
search
of
adventure
pneumonia
will
happen
if
you
do
what
business
has
it
to
be
raining
anyway
when
it
ought
to
be
snowing
as
this
was
unanswerable
priscilla
returned
to
her
frogs
and
patty
drummed
gloomily
on
the
until
a
maid
appeared
with
a
card
a
caller
cried
patty
a
missionary
a
rescuer
a
deliverer
heaven
send
it
for
me
miss
pond
said
sadie
laying
the
card
on
the
table
patty
pounced
upon
it
frederick
k
stanthrope
who
he
pris
priscilla
wrinkled
up
her
brows
i
do
know
i
never
heard
of
him
what
do
you
suppose
it
can
be
an
adventure
i
know
it
an
adventure
probably
your
uncle
that
you
never
heard
of
has
just
died
in
the
south
sea
islands
and
left
you
a
fortune
because
you
his
namesake
or
else
you
a
countess
by
rights
and
were
stolen
from
your
cradle
in
infancy
and
he
the
lawyer
come
to
tell
you
about
it
i
think
it
might
have
happened
to
me
when
i
so
bored
to
death
but
hurry
up
and
tell
me
about
it
at
least
a
adventure
better
than
no
adventure
at
all
yes
your
hair
is
all
right
never
mind
looking
in
the
glass
and
patty
pushed
her
out
of
the
door
and
sitting
down
at
her
desk
again
quite
cheerfully
pulled
her
discarded
paper
out
of
the
and
began
it
with
evident
approval
priscilla
returned
before
she
had
finished
he
did
ask
for
me
at
all
she
announced
he
asked
for
miss
mckay
miss
mckay
that
junior
with
the
hair
she
explained
a
trifle
vaguely
how
disgusting
cried
patty
i
had
it
all
planned
how
i
was
going
to
live
with
you
in
your
castle
up
in
the
hartz
mountains
and
now
it
turns
out
that
miss
mckay
is
the
countess
and
i
do
even
know
her
what
did
the
man
look
like
and
what
did
he
do
well
he
looked
rather
frightened
and
did
do
anything
but
stammer
there
were
two
men
in
the
and
of
course
i
picked
out
the
wrong
one
and
begged
his
pardon
and
asked
if
he
were
stanthrope
he
said
no
his
name
was
wiggins
so
then
the
only
thing
left
for
me
to
do
was
to
beg
the
other
one
pardon
he
was
sitting
in
that
green
chair
with
his
eyes
glued
to
his
shoes
and
holding
his
hat
and
cane
in
front
of
him
like
breastworks
as
if
he
were
preparing
to
repel
an
attack
he
did
look
very
approachable
but
i
boldly
accosted
him
and
asked
if
he
were
stanthrope
he
stood
up
and
stammered
and
blushed
and
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
deny
it
but
finally
acknowledged
that
he
was
and
then
stood
politely
waiting
for
me
to
state
my
business
i
explained
and
he
stammered
some
more
and
finally
got
out
that
he
had
called
to
see
miss
mckay
and
that
the
maid
must
have
made
a
mistake
he
was
quite
cross
about
it
you
know
and
acted
as
if
i
had
insulted
him
and
the
other
man
the
horrible
wiggins
one
laughed
and
then
looked
out
of
the
window
and
pretended
he
had
i
apologized
though
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
see
what
there
was
to
apologize
for
and
told
him
i
would
send
the
maid
for
miss
mckay
and
backed
out
is
that
all
patty
asked
disappointedly
if
i
could
have
a
better
adventure
than
that
i
should
have
any
but
the
funny
thing
is
that
when
i
told
sadie
she
that
he
had
asked
for
me
ha
the
plot
thickens
after
all
what
does
it
mean
did
he
look
like
a
detective
or
merely
a
pickpocket
he
looked
like
a
very
ordinarily
embarrassed
young
man
patty
shook
her
head
dejectedly
there
a
mystery
somewhere
but
i
do
see
that
it
affords
much
entertainment
i
dare
say
that
when
miss
mckay
came
he
told
her
he
had
asked
for
her
at
all
he
had
asked
for
miss
higginbotham
the
only
explanation
i
can
think
of
is
that
he
is
insane
and
there
are
so
many
insane
people
in
the
world
that
it
even
interesting
patty
recounted
the
story
of
priscilla
caller
at
the
that
night
i
know
the
sequel
said
lucille
carter
the
other
man
the
wiggins
is
bonnie
connaught
cousin
and
he
told
her
about
some
young
man
who
came
out
in
the
car
with
him
and
asked
for
miss
pond
at
the
door
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
to
change
his
mind
and
went
tearing
down
the
corridor
after
the
maid
yelling
there
hi
there
at
the
top
of
his
voice
but
he
could
catch
her
and
when
miss
pond
came
he
pretended
he
had
asked
for
some
one
else
is
that
all
asked
patty
i
do
think
it
is
much
of
a
sequel
it
just
proves
that
there
a
plot
against
priscilla
life
and
i
already
knew
that
i
intend
to
ask
miss
mckay
about
him
i
do
know
her
except
by
sight
but
in
a
case
of
life
and
death
like
this
i
think
it
necessary
to
wait
for
an
introduction
the
next
evening
patty
announced
sequel
number
two
frederick
stanthrope
lives
in
new
york
and
is
miss
mckay
brother
best
friend
she
has
only
met
him
once
before
and
does
know
any
of
his
past
affiliations
but
the
queer
thing
is
that
he
never
mentioned
to
her
anything
about
priscilla
should
you
naturally
think
he
would
have
told
her
about
such
a
funny
mistake
in
my
opinion
patty
continued
solemnly
it
was
plainly
premeditated
he
is
undoubtedly
a
villain
in
disguise
and
he
used
his
acquaintance
with
miss
mckay
as
a
cloak
to
elude
detection
my
theory
is
this
he
got
priscilla
name
out
of
the
catalogue
and
came
here
intending
to
murder
her
for
her
but
when
he
saw
how
big
she
was
he
was
scared
and
so
abandoned
his
dastardly
intent
now
if
he
had
chosen
me
my
body
would
at
this
moment
have
been
concealed
behind
the
sofa
and
my
reposing
in
the
murderer
pocket
patty
shuddered
think
what
i
escaped
and
all
the
time
i
was
grumbling
because
nothing
ever
happens
here
a
few
days
later
she
appeared
at
the
table
with
a
further
announcement
i
have
the
pleasure
of
offering
for
your
perusal
young
ladies
the
third
and
last
sequel
in
the
great
mystery
and
i
hereby
take
the
opportunity
of
apologizing
to
stanthrope
for
my
unworthy
suspicions
he
is
not
a
burglar
nor
a
detective
nor
a
murderer
nor
even
a
lawyer
but
just
a
poor
young
man
with
a
buried
romance
how
did
you
find
out
in
a
chorus
of
voices
i
just
met
miss
mckay
in
the
hall
and
she
has
been
in
new
york
where
her
brother
told
her
the
particulars
it
seems
that
three
or
four
years
ago
frederick
stanthrope
was
engaged
to
a
girl
here
in
college
named
alice
pond
she
is
now
hiram
brown
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
being
in
town
last
saturday
on
business
he
decided
to
run
out
and
call
on
miss
mckay
as
he
was
such
a
friend
of
her
brother
and
also
for
the
sake
of
old
times
he
amused
himself
all
the
way
out
in
the
car
by
resurrecting
his
buried
romance
and
he
kept
getting
more
and
more
pensive
with
every
mile
when
he
finally
reached
the
door
and
handed
his
card
to
the
maid
he
abstractedly
called
for
miss
pond
just
as
he
used
to
do
four
years
ago
he
did
realize
at
first
what
he
had
done
then
it
came
over
him
in
a
flash
but
he
could
catch
sadie
he
knew
of
course
that
the
other
man
had
heard
and
he
sat
there
scared
to
death
trying
to
think
of
some
plausible
excuse
and
momentarily
expecting
a
strange
miss
pond
to
pop
in
and
demand
an
explanation
sure
enough
the
curtains
parted
and
a
tall
beautiful
stately
creature
i
quote
miss
mckay
brother
swept
into
the
room
and
approaching
the
wrong
man
asked
him
in
haughty
tones
if
he
were
frederick
stanthrope
he
very
properly
denied
it
whereupon
there
was
nothing
for
the
right
stanthrope
to
do
but
stand
up
and
acknowledge
it
like
a
man
which
he
did
but
there
he
stuck
his
imagination
was
numbed
paralyzed
so
he
turned
it
off
on
poor
sadie
and
all
the
time
he
knew
that
the
other
man
knew
that
he
was
lying
and
that
is
all
patty
finished
it
not
much
of
a
story
but
such
as
it
is
it
a
blessing
to
have
it
concluded
patty
called
priscilla
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
have
you
been
telling
them
that
absurd
story
why
not
asked
patty
having
heard
so
many
sequels
they
naturally
wanted
to
hear
the
last
priscilla
laughed
but
yours
does
happen
to
be
the
last
i
know
a
still
later
one
later
than
patty
the
table
demanded
yes
later
than
patty
it
is
really
a
sequel
it
just
an
appendix
i
should
tell
you
only
you
find
it
out
so
i
might
as
well
miss
mckay
has
invited
two
men
for
the
junior
party
and
both
have
accepted
as
two
men
are
hard
to
manage
she
has
by
request
asked
me
to
take
care
of
one
of
them
namely
frederick
k
stanthrope
patty
sighed
i
see
a
whole
series
of
sequels
stretching
away
into
the
future
it
worse
than
the
elsie
books
vii
in
pursuit
of
old
english
hello
patty
have
you
read
the
this
morning
called
cathy
fair
as
she
caught
up
with
patty
on
the
way
home
from
a
recitation
no
said
patty
i
think
it
a
bad
habit
you
see
too
many
unpleasant
things
there
well
there
certainly
an
unpleasant
one
miss
skelling
wishes
the
old
english
class
to
be
provided
with
writing
materials
this
afternoon
patty
stopped
with
a
groan
i
think
it
absolutely
abominable
to
give
an
examination
without
a
word
of
warning
not
an
examination
quoted
cathy
just
a
test
to
see
how
much
you
know
i
do
know
a
thing
wailed
patty
not
a
blessed
thing
nonsense
patty
you
know
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
class
bluff
it
all
pure
bluff
i
come
in
strong
on
the
literary
criticism
and
the
general
discussions
and
she
never
realizes
that
i
do
know
a
word
of
the
grammar
you
got
two
hours
you
can
cut
your
classes
and
review
it
up
two
hours
said
patty
sadly
i
need
two
days
i
never
learned
it
i
tell
you
the
grammar
is
a
thing
no
mortal
can
carry
in
his
head
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
wait
and
learn
it
before
examinations
i
do
wish
to
appear
unfeeling
laughed
cathy
but
i
should
say
my
dear
that
it
serves
you
right
oh
i
dare
say
said
patty
you
are
as
bad
as
priscilla
and
she
trailed
gloomily
homeward
she
found
her
friends
reviewing
biology
and
eating
olives
have
one
asked
lucille
carter
who
provided
with
a
by
way
of
fork
was
presiding
over
the
bottle
for
the
moment
no
thanks
returned
patty
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
exhausted
life
and
longs
for
death
what
the
matter
inquired
priscilla
you
do
mean
to
say
that
woman
has
given
you
another
special
topic
worse
than
that
and
patty
laid
bare
the
tragedy
a
sympathetic
silence
followed
they
realized
that
while
she
was
perhaps
not
strictly
deserving
of
sympathy
still
her
impending
fate
was
of
the
kind
that
might
overtake
any
one
you
know
pris
said
patty
miserably
that
i
simply
pass
no
said
priscilla
soothingly
i
do
believe
you
can
i
shall
flunk
absolutely
miss
skelling
will
never
have
any
confidence
in
me
again
and
will
make
me
recite
every
bit
of
grammar
for
the
rest
of
the
semester
i
should
think
you
cut
ventured
georgie
that
being
in
her
opinion
the
most
obvious
method
of
escaping
an
examination
i
ca
i
just
met
miss
skelling
in
the
hall
five
minutes
before
the
blow
fell
and
she
knows
i
alive
and
able
to
be
about
besides
the
class
meets
again
morning
and
i
have
to
cram
all
night
or
cut
that
too
why
do
you
go
to
miss
skelling
and
frankly
explain
the
situation
suggested
lucille
the
virtuous
and
ask
her
to
let
you
off
for
a
day
or
two
she
would
like
you
all
the
better
for
it
will
you
listen
to
the
guileless
babe
said
patty
what
is
there
to
explain
may
i
ask
i
ca
very
well
tell
her
that
i
prefer
not
to
learn
the
lessons
as
she
gives
them
out
but
think
it
easier
to
wait
and
cram
them
up
at
one
fell
swoop
just
before
examinations
that
ingratiate
myself
in
her
favor
it
your
own
fault
said
priscilla
patty
groaned
i
was
just
waiting
to
hear
you
say
that
you
always
do
it
always
true
where
are
you
going
as
patty
started
for
the
door
i
am
going
said
patty
to
ask
richards
to
give
me
a
new
one
who
will
understand
and
appreciate
me
and
sympathize
with
my
afflictions
patty
walked
gloomily
down
the
corridor
lost
in
meditation
her
way
led
past
the
door
of
the
doctor
office
which
was
standing
invitingly
open
three
or
four
girls
were
sitting
around
the
room
laughing
and
talking
and
waiting
their
turns
patty
glanced
in
and
a
radiant
smile
suddenly
lightened
her
face
but
it
was
instantly
replaced
by
a
look
of
settled
sadness
she
walked
in
and
dropped
into
an
with
a
sigh
what
the
matter
patty
you
look
as
if
you
had
melancholia
patty
smiled
apathetically
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
she
murmured
and
leaned
back
and
closed
her
eyes
illustration
what
the
matter
patty
next
said
the
doctor
from
the
doorway
but
as
she
caught
sight
of
patty
she
walked
over
and
shook
her
arm
is
this
patty
wyatt
what
is
the
matter
with
you
child
patty
opened
her
eyes
with
a
start
nothing
she
said
i
just
a
little
tired
come
in
here
with
me
it
not
my
turn
objected
patty
that
makes
no
difference
returned
the
doctor
patty
dropped
limply
into
the
let
me
see
your
tongue
is
coated
very
much
your
pulse
seems
regular
though
possibly
a
trifle
feverish
have
you
been
working
hard
i
do
think
i
been
working
any
harder
than
usual
said
patty
truthfully
sitting
up
late
nights
patty
considered
i
was
up
rather
late
twice
last
week
she
confessed
if
you
girls
persist
in
studying
until
all
hours
of
the
night
i
do
know
what
we
doctors
can
do
patty
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
explain
that
it
was
a
party
on
each
occasion
so
she
merely
sighed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
is
your
appetite
good
yes
said
patty
in
a
tone
which
belied
the
words
it
seems
to
be
very
good
said
the
doctor
i
just
a
little
tired
pursued
patty
but
i
think
i
shall
be
all
right
as
soon
as
i
get
a
chance
to
rest
perhaps
i
need
a
tonic
she
suggested
you
better
stay
out
of
classes
for
a
day
or
two
and
get
thoroughly
rested
oh
no
said
patty
in
evident
perturbation
our
room
is
so
full
of
girls
all
the
time
that
it
really
more
restful
to
go
to
classes
and
besides
i
ca
stay
out
just
now
why
not
demanded
the
doctor
suspiciously
well
said
patty
a
trifle
reluctantly
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
i
got
to
cram
for
an
examination
and
the
word
cram
was
to
the
doctor
as
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
nonsense
she
ejaculated
i
know
what
i
shall
do
with
you
you
are
going
right
over
to
the
infirmary
for
a
few
days
oh
doctor
patty
pleaded
with
tears
in
her
eyes
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
and
i
to
take
that
examination
what
examination
is
it
old
english
miss
skelling
i
will
see
miss
skelling
myself
said
the
doctor
and
explain
that
you
can
not
take
the
examination
until
you
come
out
and
now
she
added
making
a
note
of
patty
case
i
will
have
you
put
in
the
convalescent
ward
and
we
will
try
the
rest
cure
for
a
few
days
and
feed
you
up
on
and
and
see
if
we
can
get
that
appetite
back
thank
you
said
patty
with
the
resigned
air
of
one
who
has
given
up
struggling
against
the
inevitable
i
like
to
see
you
take
an
interest
in
your
work
added
the
doctor
kindly
but
you
must
always
remember
my
dear
that
health
is
the
first
consideration
patty
returned
to
the
study
and
executed
an
impromptu
dance
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
what
the
matter
exclaimed
priscilla
are
you
crazy
no
said
patty
only
and
she
went
into
her
bedroom
and
began
slinging
things
into
a
case
priscilla
stood
in
the
doorway
and
watched
her
in
amazement
are
you
going
to
new
york
she
asked
no
said
patty
to
the
infirmary
patty
wyatt
you
a
wretched
little
hypocrite
not
at
all
said
patty
cheerfully
i
did
ask
to
go
but
the
doctor
simply
insisted
i
told
her
i
had
an
examination
but
she
said
it
did
make
any
difference
health
must
be
the
first
consideration
what
in
that
bottle
demanded
priscilla
that
for
my
appetite
said
patty
with
a
grin
the
doctor
hopes
to
improve
it
i
did
like
to
discourage
her
but
i
do
much
believe
she
can
she
dropped
an
old
english
grammar
and
a
copy
of
beowulf
into
her
they
wo
let
you
study
said
priscilla
i
shall
not
ask
them
said
patty
tell
the
girls
to
drop
in
occasionally
and
see
me
in
my
incarceration
visiting
hour
from
five
to
six
she
stuck
her
head
in
again
if
any
one
wants
to
send
violets
i
think
they
might
cheer
me
up
the
next
afternoon
georgie
and
priscilla
presented
themselves
at
the
infirmary
and
were
met
at
the
door
by
the
austere
figure
of
the
head
nurse
i
will
see
if
miss
wyatt
is
awake
she
said
dubiously
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
excite
her
she
to
be
kept
very
quiet
oh
no
we
do
her
good
remonstrated
georgie
and
the
two
girls
tiptoed
in
after
the
nurse
the
convalescent
ward
was
a
large
airy
room
furnished
in
green
and
white
with
four
or
five
beds
each
surrounded
with
brass
poles
and
curtains
patty
was
lying
in
one
of
the
corner
beds
near
a
window
propped
up
on
pillows
with
her
hair
tumbled
about
her
face
and
a
table
beside
her
covered
with
flowers
and
glasses
of
medicine
this
elaborate
paraphernalia
of
sickness
created
a
momentary
illusion
in
the
minds
of
the
visitors
priscilla
ran
to
the
bedside
and
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
her
invalid
patty
dear
she
said
anxiously
how
do
you
feel
a
seraphic
smile
spread
over
patty
face
i
been
able
to
take
a
little
nourishment
she
said
patty
you
a
scandalous
humbug
who
gave
you
those
violets
love
from
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
that
blessed
freshman
and
borrowed
every
drop
of
alcohol
the
poor
child
ever
thought
of
owning
and
whom
are
those
roses
from
miss
skelling
patty
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
patty
had
the
grace
to
blush
slightly
i
was
a
trifle
embarrassed
she
admitted
but
when
i
reflected
upon
how
sorry
she
would
have
been
to
find
out
how
little
i
knew
and
how
glad
she
will
be
to
find
out
how
much
i
know
my
conscience
was
appeased
have
you
been
studying
asked
georgie
studying
patty
lifted
up
the
corner
of
her
pillow
and
exhibited
a
blue
book
two
days
more
of
this
and
i
shall
be
the
chief
authority
in
america
on
roots
how
do
you
manage
it
oh
said
patty
when
the
begins
i
lie
down
and
shut
my
eyes
and
they
tiptoe
over
and
look
at
me
and
whisper
asleep
and
softly
draw
the
curtains
around
the
bed
and
i
get
out
the
book
and
put
in
two
solid
hours
of
irregular
verbs
and
am
still
sleeping
when
they
come
to
look
at
me
they
perfectly
astonished
at
the
amount
i
sleep
i
heard
the
nurse
telling
the
doctor
that
she
did
believe
had
any
sleep
for
a
month
and
the
worst
of
it
is
she
added
that
i
tired
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
and
i
should
just
love
to
stay
over
here
and
sleep
all
day
if
i
were
so
beastly
conscientious
about
that
old
grammar
poor
patty
laughed
georgie
she
will
be
imposing
on
herself
next
as
well
as
on
the
whole
college
friday
morning
patty
returned
to
the
world
how
old
english
inquired
priscilla
very
well
thank
you
it
was
something
of
a
cram
but
i
think
i
know
that
grammar
by
heart
from
the
preface
to
the
index
you
back
in
all
your
other
work
do
you
think
it
paid
that
remains
to
be
seen
laughed
patty
she
knocked
on
miss
skelling
door
and
after
the
first
polite
greetings
stated
her
errand
i
should
like
if
it
is
convenient
for
you
to
take
the
examination
i
missed
do
you
feel
able
to
take
it
i
feel
much
better
able
to
take
it
than
i
did
on
tuesday
miss
skelling
smiled
kindly
you
have
done
very
good
work
in
old
english
this
semester
miss
wyatt
and
i
should
not
ask
you
to
take
the
examination
at
all
if
i
thought
it
would
be
fair
to
the
rest
of
the
class
fair
to
the
rest
of
the
class
patty
looked
a
trifle
blank
she
had
not
considered
this
aspect
of
the
question
and
a
slow
red
flush
crept
over
her
face
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
rose
uncertainly
when
it
comes
to
that
miss
skelling
she
confessed
i
afraid
it
would
be
quite
fair
to
the
rest
of
the
class
for
me
to
take
it
miss
skelling
did
not
understand
but
miss
wyatt
she
expostulated
in
a
puzzled
tone
it
was
not
difficult
i
am
sure
you
could
pass
patty
smiled
i
am
sure
i
could
miss
skelling
i
do
believe
you
could
ask
me
a
question
that
i
could
answer
but
the
point
is
that
it
all
learned
since
tuesday
the
doctor
was
laboring
under
a
little
delusion
very
natural
under
the
circumstances
when
she
sent
me
to
the
infirmary
and
i
spent
my
time
there
studying
but
miss
wyatt
this
is
very
unusual
i
shall
not
know
how
to
mark
you
miss
skelling
murmured
in
some
distress
oh
mark
me
zero
said
patty
cheerfully
it
does
matter
in
the
least
i
know
such
a
lot
that
i
get
through
on
the
finals
i
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
and
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
thoughtfully
homeward
did
it
pay
asked
priscilla
patty
laughed
and
murmured
softly
king
of
france
rode
up
the
hill
with
full
ten
thousand
men
the
king
of
france
did
gain
the
top
and
then
rode
down
again
what
are
you
talking
about
demanded
priscilla
old
english
said
patty
as
she
sat
down
at
her
desk
and
commenced
on
the
three
days
work
she
had
missed
viii
the
deceased
robert
it
was
ten
and
patty
having
just
read
her
ethics
over
for
the
third
time
without
comprehending
it
had
announced
sleepily
i
shall
have
to
be
good
by
inspiration
i
ca
seem
to
grasp
the
rule
when
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
and
a
maid
appeared
with
the
announcement
richards
wishes
to
see
miss
wyatt
at
this
hour
patty
cried
in
dismay
it
must
be
something
serious
think
priscilla
what
have
i
been
doing
lately
that
would
outrage
the
warden
sufficiently
to
call
me
up
at
ten
you
do
suppose
going
to
be
suspended
or
rusticated
or
expelled
or
anything
like
that
do
you
i
ca
think
of
a
thing
i
done
it
a
telegram
the
maid
said
sympathetically
a
telegram
patty
face
turned
pale
and
she
left
the
room
without
a
word
priscilla
and
georgie
sat
on
the
couch
and
looked
at
each
other
with
troubled
faces
all
ordinary
telegrams
came
directly
to
the
students
they
knew
that
something
serious
must
have
happened
to
have
it
sent
to
the
warden
georgie
got
up
and
walked
around
the
room
uncertainly
shall
i
go
away
pris
she
asked
i
suppose
patty
would
rather
be
alone
if
anything
has
happened
but
if
she
going
home
and
has
to
pack
her
trunk
come
and
tell
me
and
i
will
come
down
and
help
they
stood
at
the
door
a
few
moments
talking
in
low
tones
and
as
georgie
started
to
turn
away
patty
step
suddenly
sounded
in
the
corridor
she
came
in
with
a
queer
smile
on
her
lips
and
sat
down
on
the
couch
the
warden
has
certainly
reduced
the
matter
of
scaring
people
to
a
fine
art
she
said
i
was
never
more
frightened
in
my
life
i
thought
that
the
least
that
had
happened
was
an
earthquake
which
had
engulfed
the
entire
family
what
was
the
matter
georgie
and
priscilla
asked
in
a
breath
patty
spread
out
a
crumpled
telegram
on
her
knee
and
the
girls
read
it
over
her
shoulder
robert
died
of
an
overdose
of
chloroform
at
ten
this
morning
funeral
thomas
wyatt
thomas
wyatt
said
patty
grimly
is
my
small
brother
tommy
and
robert
is
short
for
bobby
shafto
which
was
the
name
of
tommy
bull
pup
the
homeliest
and
dog
that
was
ever
received
into
the
bosom
of
a
respectable
family
but
why
in
the
world
did
he
telegraph
it
a
joke
said
patty
shaking
her
head
dejectedly
joking
runs
in
the
family
and
we
all
inherited
the
tendency
one
time
my
father
but
as
my
friend
kipling
says
that
another
story
this
dog
you
see
this
robert
shafto
has
cast
a
shadow
over
my
vacations
for
more
than
a
year
he
killed
my
kitten
and
ate
my
venetian
lace
collar
it
did
even
give
him
indigestion
he
went
out
and
wallowed
in
the
rain
and
mud
and
came
in
and
slept
on
my
bed
he
stole
the
beefsteak
for
breakfast
and
the
rubbers
and
for
blocks
around
property
on
the
street
appreciably
declined
for
prospective
purchasers
refused
to
purchase
so
long
as
tommy
wyatt
kept
a
dog
robert
was
threatened
with
death
time
and
again
but
tommy
always
managed
to
conceal
him
from
impending
justice
until
the
trouble
had
blown
over
but
this
time
i
suppose
he
committed
some
supreme
enormity
probably
chewed
up
the
baby
or
one
of
my
father
persian
rugs
or
something
like
that
and
tommy
knowing
how
i
detested
the
beast
evidently
thought
it
would
be
a
good
joke
to
telegraph
though
wherein
lies
the
point
i
ca
make
out
ah
i
see
said
georgie
and
richards
thought
that
robert
was
a
relation
what
did
she
say
she
said
in
patty
dear
when
i
knocked
on
the
door
usually
when
i
have
had
the
honor
of
being
received
by
her
she
has
somewhat
frigidly
called
me
wyatt
i
opened
the
door
with
my
knees
shaking
when
i
heard
that
dear
and
she
took
my
hand
and
said
am
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
heard
bad
news
from
your
brother
i
gasped
robert
i
was
dazed
i
racked
my
brains
but
i
could
remember
any
brother
robert
is
very
ill
she
went
on
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
patty
poor
little
robert
passed
away
this
morning
and
she
laid
the
telegram
before
me
then
when
it
flashed
over
me
what
it
meant
i
was
so
relieved
that
i
put
my
head
down
on
her
desk
and
simply
laughed
till
i
cried
and
she
thought
i
was
crying
all
the
time
and
kept
patting
my
head
and
quoting
psalms
well
then
i
did
dare
to
tell
her
after
she
had
expended
all
that
sympathy
so
as
soon
as
i
could
stop
laughing
which
was
very
soon
for
i
had
got
considerable
momentum
i
raised
my
head
and
told
her
trying
to
be
truthful
and
at
the
same
time
not
hurt
her
feelings
that
robert
was
not
a
brother
but
just
a
sort
of
friend
and
do
you
know
she
immediately
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
fiancé
and
began
stroking
my
hair
and
murmuring
that
it
was
sometimes
harder
to
lose
friends
than
relatives
but
that
i
was
still
young
and
i
must
not
let
it
blast
my
life
and
that
maybe
in
the
future
when
time
had
dulled
the
pain
and
then
remembering
that
it
would
do
to
advise
me
to
adopt
a
second
fiancé
before
i
had
buried
my
first
she
stopped
suddenly
and
asked
if
i
wished
to
go
home
to
the
funeral
i
told
her
no
that
i
did
think
it
would
be
best
and
she
said
perhaps
not
if
it
had
been
announced
and
she
kissed
me
and
told
me
she
was
glad
to
see
me
bearing
up
so
bravely
patty
priscilla
exclaimed
in
horror
it
dreadful
how
could
you
let
her
think
it
how
could
i
help
it
patty
demanded
indignantly
what
with
being
frightened
into
hysterics
first
and
then
having
a
strange
fiancé
thrust
at
me
without
a
moment
notice
i
think
that
i
carried
off
the
situation
with
rare
delicacy
and
finesse
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
tactful
to
tell
her
it
was
nothing
but
a
bull
pup
she
was
quoting
scripture
about
i
do
see
how
it
was
exactly
your
fault
georgie
acknowledged
thank
you
said
patty
if
you
had
a
brother
like
tommy
wyatt
you
would
know
how
to
sympathize
with
me
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
know
that
the
dog
is
dead
but
i
should
like
to
have
had
the
news
broken
a
little
less
gently
patty
exclaimed
priscilla
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
do
you
happen
to
remember
that
you
are
on
the
reception
committee
of
the
dramatic
club
cotillion
night
what
will
richards
think
when
she
sees
you
in
evening
dress
receiving
at
a
party
on
the
very
day
your
fiancé
has
been
buried
i
wonder
said
patty
doubtfully
do
you
really
think
i
ought
to
stay
away
after
working
like
a
little
making
favors
for
the
thing
i
hate
to
have
to
miss
it
just
because
my
brother
bull
pup
that
i
never
even
is
dead
i
go
she
added
brightening
and
receive
the
guests
with
a
forced
and
mechanical
smile
and
every
time
i
feel
the
warden
eyes
upon
me
i
shall
with
difficulty
choke
back
the
tears
and
she
will
say
to
herself
girl
how
nobly
she
is
struggling
to
present
a
composed
face
to
the
world
none
would
dream
to
look
at
that
seemingly
radiant
creature
that
while
she
is
outwardly
so
gay
she
is
in
reality
concealing
a
great
sorrow
which
is
gnawing
at
her
very
vitals
ix
patty
the
comforter
it
was
on
the
eve
of
the
examinations
and
a
gloom
had
fallen
over
the
college
the
conscientious
ones
who
had
worked
all
the
year
were
working
harder
than
ever
and
the
frivolous
ones
who
had
played
all
the
year
were
working
with
a
desperate
frenzy
calculated
to
render
their
minds
a
blank
when
the
crucial
hour
should
have
arrived
but
patty
was
not
working
it
was
a
canon
of
her
college
philosophy
gained
by
three
and
a
half
years
of
personal
experience
that
the
day
before
examinations
is
not
the
time
to
begin
to
study
one
has
impressed
the
instructor
with
one
intelligent
interest
in
the
subject
or
one
has
not
and
the
result
is
as
sure
as
if
the
marks
were
already
down
in
black
and
white
in
the
college
archives
and
so
patty
who
at
least
lived
up
to
her
lights
was
with
the
exception
of
a
few
points
which
she
intended
to
learn
for
this
period
only
conscientiously
neglecting
the
judicious
review
recommended
by
the
faculty
her
friends
however
who
though
perhaps
equally
philosophic
were
less
consistent
were
subjecting
themselves
to
what
was
known
as
a
regular
freshman
cram
and
as
no
one
had
any
time
to
talk
to
patty
or
to
make
anything
to
eat
she
found
it
an
unprofitable
period
her
own
even
drove
her
from
the
study
because
she
laughed
out
loud
over
the
book
she
was
reading
and
an
exile
she
wandered
around
to
the
studies
of
her
friends
and
was
confronted
by
an
engaged
on
every
door
she
was
sitting
on
a
in
the
corridor
pondering
on
the
general
barrenness
of
things
when
she
suddenly
remembered
her
friends
the
freshmen
in
study
she
had
not
visited
them
for
some
time
and
freshmen
are
usually
interesting
at
this
period
she
accordingly
turned
down
the
corridor
that
led
to
and
found
a
positively
engaged
to
every
one
in
letters
three
inches
high
across
the
door
this
promised
a
richness
of
entertainment
within
and
patty
heaved
a
disappointed
sigh
loud
enough
to
carry
through
the
transom
the
turning
of
leaves
and
rustling
of
paper
ceased
evidently
they
were
listening
but
they
gave
no
sign
patty
wrote
a
note
on
the
with
reverberating
and
then
retired
noisily
and
tiptoed
back
a
moment
later
and
leaned
against
the
wall
curiosity
prevailed
the
door
opened
and
a
face
wearing
a
hunted
look
peered
out
oh
patty
wyatt
was
that
you
she
asked
we
thought
it
was
frances
stoddard
coming
down
to
have
geometry
explained
and
so
we
kept
still
come
in
goodness
no
i
would
come
in
over
an
like
that
for
anything
i
afraid
you
busy
the
freshman
grasped
her
by
the
arm
patty
if
you
love
us
come
in
and
cheer
us
up
we
so
scared
we
do
know
what
to
do
patty
consented
to
be
drawn
across
the
threshold
i
do
want
to
interrupt
you
she
remonstrated
if
you
have
anything
to
do
the
study
was
occupied
by
three
girls
patty
smiled
benignly
at
the
two
haggard
faces
before
her
where
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
she
asked
she
surely
is
wasting
these
precious
last
moments
in
anything
frivolous
she
in
her
bedroom
with
a
geometry
in
one
hand
and
a
greek
grammar
in
the
other
trying
to
learn
them
both
at
once
tell
her
to
come
out
here
i
want
to
give
her
some
good
advice
and
patty
sat
down
on
the
divan
and
surveyed
the
room
with
an
appreciative
smile
oh
patty
i
so
glad
to
see
you
lady
clara
exclaimed
appearing
in
the
doorway
the
sophomores
have
been
telling
us
the
most
stories
about
examinations
they
are
true
are
they
mercy
no
do
believe
a
word
those
sophomores
tell
you
they
were
freshmen
themselves
last
year
and
if
the
examinations
were
as
bad
as
they
say
they
would
have
passed
them
either
a
relieved
expression
stole
over
the
three
faces
you
such
a
comfort
patty
take
things
easily
they
one
gets
inured
to
almost
anything
in
time
said
patty
examinations
are
even
entertaining
if
you
know
the
right
answers
but
we
wo
know
the
right
answers
one
of
the
freshmen
wailed
her
terror
returning
we
simply
do
know
and
latin
comes
and
geometry
the
next
day
oh
well
in
that
case
you
ca
get
through
anyway
so
do
worry
you
must
take
it
philosophically
you
know
patty
settled
herself
among
the
cushions
and
smiled
upon
her
frightened
auditors
with
easy
nonchalance
as
an
example
of
the
uselessness
of
studying
at
the
eleventh
hour
when
you
have
done
anything
through
the
term
i
will
tell
you
my
experience
with
freshman
greek
i
was
badly
prepared
when
i
came
i
did
study
through
the
term
and
without
exaggeration
i
did
know
anything
three
days
before
examinations
i
suddenly
comprehended
the
situation
and
i
began
swallowing
that
grammar
in
chunks
i
drank
black
coffee
to
keep
awake
and
worked
till
two
in
the
morning
and
scarcely
stopped
cramming
irregular
verbs
for
meals
i
simply
thought
in
greek
and
dreamed
in
greek
and
if
you
will
believe
it
after
all
that
work
i
flunked
in
greek
it
shook
my
faith
in
studying
for
examinations
i
never
done
it
since
and
i
never
flunked
since
i
believe
that
it
just
a
matter
of
fate
whether
you
get
through
or
not
so
i
never
bother
any
more
the
freshmen
looked
at
one
another
disconsolately
if
it
all
decided
beforehand
we
lost
patty
smiled
reassuringly
a
little
flunking
now
and
then
will
happen
to
the
best
of
men
but
i
heard
they
send
people
home
drop
them
you
know
if
they
flunk
more
than
a
certain
amount
is
that
so
lady
clara
inquired
in
hushed
tones
oh
yes
said
patty
they
have
to
i
known
some
of
the
brightest
girls
in
college
to
be
dropped
lady
clara
groaned
i
awfully
shaky
in
geometry
patty
do
they
flunk
many
girls
in
that
many
said
patty
the
mere
clerical
labor
of
writing
out
the
notes
occupies
the
department
two
days
is
the
examination
terribly
hard
i
do
remember
much
about
it
it
been
such
a
long
time
since
i
was
a
freshman
you
see
they
picked
out
the
hardest
theorems
i
know
things
you
could
even
draw
let
alone
demonstrate
the
pyramid
that
cut
in
slices
for
one
i
do
remember
its
name
and
that
sprawling
one
that
looks
like
a
snail
crawling
out
of
its
shell
the
devil
coffin
i
believe
it
called
technically
and
oh
yes
they
give
you
originals
originals
like
nothing
you
ever
had
before
and
they
put
a
little
note
at
the
top
of
the
page
telling
you
to
do
them
first
and
you
get
so
muddled
trying
to
think
fast
that
you
ca
think
at
all
i
know
a
girl
who
spent
all
the
two
hours
trying
to
think
out
an
original
and
just
as
she
got
ready
to
write
it
down
the
bell
rang
and
she
had
to
hand
in
her
paper
and
what
happened
oh
she
flunked
you
could
really
blame
the
instructor
you
know
for
not
reading
between
the
lines
for
there
were
any
lines
to
read
between
but
it
was
sort
of
a
pity
for
the
girl
really
knew
an
awful
lot
but
she
could
express
it
that
just
like
me
ah
it
like
a
good
many
people
a
silence
ensued
and
the
freshmen
looked
at
one
another
dejectedly
but
you
can
live
even
if
you
should
flunk
math
patty
continued
reassuringly
other
people
have
done
it
before
you
if
it
were
only
geometry
but
we
scared
over
latin
oh
latin
there
no
use
studying
for
that
for
you
ca
possibly
read
it
all
over
and
if
you
just
pick
out
a
part
it
sure
not
to
be
the
same
part
pick
out
the
best
way
is
to
say
incantations
over
the
book
and
open
it
with
your
eyes
blindfolded
and
study
the
page
it
opens
to
then
in
case
you
do
pass
and
you
probably
wo
you
can
throw
the
blame
on
fate
my
freshman
year
if
i
remember
right
they
gave
us
for
prose
composition
one
of
emerson
essays
to
translate
into
latin
and
we
could
even
tell
what
it
meant
in
english
the
three
looked
at
one
another
again
i
could
do
anything
like
that
nor
i
nor
i
nor
any
one
else
said
patty
we
can
flunk
latin
and
math
but
if
we
flunk
any
more
we
gone
i
believe
so
said
patty
and
i
awfully
shaky
in
german
and
i
in
french
and
i
in
greek
i
do
know
anything
about
german
said
patty
never
had
it
myself
but
i
remember
hearing
priscilla
say
that
the
printed
examination
papers
did
come
but
in
time
and
fräulein
scherin
who
writes
a
frightful
hand
wrote
the
questions
on
the
board
in
german
script
and
they
could
even
read
them
in
french
i
believe
the
first
question
was
to
write
out
the
there
are
seven
verses
and
no
one
had
learned
them
and
the
you
know
is
a
thing
that
you
simply
make
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
as
for
greek
i
told
you
my
own
experience
i
am
sure
nothing
could
be
worse
than
that
the
freshmen
looked
at
one
another
hopelessly
there
only
english
and
hygiene
and
bible
history
left
english
is
something
you
ca
tell
anything
about
said
patty
they
as
likely
as
not
to
ask
you
to
write
a
heroic
poem
in
iambic
pentameters
if
you
know
what
they
are
you
have
to
depend
on
inspiration
you
ca
study
for
it
i
hope
sighed
lady
clara
to
get
through
hygiene
and
bible
history
though
as
they
only
count
one
hour
apiece
i
suppose
it
is
much
you
must
be
too
sanguine
said
patty
it
all
depends
on
chance
the
class
in
hygiene
is
so
big
that
the
professor
has
time
to
read
the
papers
he
just
goes
down
the
list
and
flunks
every
thirteenth
girl
i
not
sure
about
bible
history
but
i
think
he
does
the
same
because
i
know
freshman
year
that
i
made
a
mistake
and
handed
in
my
map
of
the
holy
lands
done
in
colored
chalk
to
the
hygiene
professor
and
my
chart
of
the
digestive
system
to
the
bible
professor
and
neither
of
them
noticed
it
they
did
look
a
good
deal
alike
but
not
so
much
but
what
you
could
tell
them
apart
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
i
hope
none
of
you
will
be
number
thirteen
the
freshmen
stared
at
one
another
in
speechless
horror
and
patty
rose
well
my
children
and
above
all
things
do
worry
glad
if
i
been
able
to
cheer
you
up
a
little
for
so
much
depends
on
not
being
nervous
do
believe
any
of
the
silly
stories
the
sophomores
tell
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
they
just
trying
to
frighten
you
x
per
college
is
a
more
or
less
selfish
place
everybody
is
so
busy
with
her
own
affairs
that
she
has
no
time
to
give
to
her
neighbor
unless
her
neighbor
has
something
to
give
in
return
olivia
copeland
apparently
had
nothing
to
give
in
return
she
was
quiet
and
inconspicuous
and
it
took
a
second
glance
to
realize
that
her
face
was
striking
and
that
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
other
freshmen
did
not
have
by
an
unfelicitous
chance
she
was
placed
in
the
same
study
with
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
and
emily
washburn
they
thought
her
foreign
and
queer
and
she
thought
them
crude
and
boisterous
and
after
the
first
week
or
two
of
politely
trying
to
get
acquainted
the
effort
was
dropped
on
both
sides
the
year
wore
on
and
nobody
knew
or
at
least
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
fact
that
olivia
copeland
was
homesick
and
unhappy
her
thought
that
they
had
done
their
duty
when
they
occasionally
asked
her
to
play
golf
or
go
skating
with
them
an
invitation
they
were
very
safe
in
giving
as
she
knew
how
to
do
neither
her
instructors
thought
that
they
had
done
their
duty
when
they
called
her
up
to
the
desk
after
class
and
warned
her
that
her
work
was
not
as
good
as
it
had
been
and
that
if
she
wished
to
pass
she
must
improve
in
it
the
english
class
was
the
only
one
in
which
she
was
not
warned
but
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
her
themes
were
handed
about
among
the
different
instructors
and
that
she
was
referred
to
in
the
department
as
that
remarkable
miss
copeland
the
department
had
a
theory
that
if
they
let
a
girl
know
she
was
doing
good
work
she
would
immediately
stop
and
rest
upon
her
reputation
and
olivia
in
consequence
did
not
discover
that
she
was
remarkable
she
merely
discovered
that
she
was
miserable
and
out
of
place
and
she
continued
to
drip
tears
of
homesickness
before
a
sketch
of
an
italian
villa
that
hung
above
her
desk
it
was
patty
wyatt
who
first
discovered
her
patty
had
dropped
into
the
freshmen
room
one
afternoon
on
some
errand
or
other
probably
to
borrow
alcohol
and
had
idly
picked
up
a
pile
of
english
themes
that
were
lying
on
the
study
table
whose
are
these
do
you
care
if
i
look
at
them
she
asked
no
you
can
read
them
if
you
want
to
said
lady
clara
olivia
but
she
wo
mind
patty
carelessly
turned
the
pages
and
then
as
a
title
caught
her
eye
she
suddenly
looked
up
with
a
show
of
interest
of
capri
what
on
earth
does
olivia
copeland
know
about
the
of
capri
oh
she
lives
somewhere
near
there
at
sorrento
said
lady
clara
indifferently
olivia
copeland
lives
at
sorrento
patty
stared
why
did
you
tell
me
i
supposed
you
knew
it
her
father
an
artist
or
something
of
the
sort
she
lived
in
italy
all
her
life
that
what
makes
her
so
queer
patty
had
once
spent
a
sunshiny
week
in
sorrento
herself
and
the
very
memory
of
it
was
intoxicating
where
is
she
she
asked
excitedly
i
want
to
talk
to
her
i
do
know
where
she
is
out
walking
probably
she
goes
off
walking
all
by
herself
and
never
speaks
to
any
one
and
then
when
we
ask
her
to
do
something
rational
like
golf
or
she
pokes
in
the
house
and
reads
dante
in
italian
imagine
why
she
must
be
interesting
said
patty
in
surprise
and
she
turned
back
to
the
themes
i
think
these
are
splendid
she
exclaimed
sort
of
queer
i
think
said
lady
clara
but
there
one
rather
funny
it
was
read
in
class
about
a
peasant
that
lost
his
donkey
i
find
it
and
she
rummaged
through
the
pile
patty
read
it
soberly
and
lady
clara
watched
her
with
a
shade
of
disappointment
do
you
think
it
pretty
good
she
asked
yes
i
think
it
one
of
the
best
things
i
ever
read
you
never
even
smiled
my
dear
child
it
is
funny
is
funny
why
the
class
simply
roared
over
it
patty
shrugged
your
appreciation
must
have
gratified
olivia
and
here
it
february
and
i
barely
spoken
to
her
the
next
afternoon
patty
was
strolling
home
from
a
recitation
when
she
spied
olivia
copeland
across
the
campus
headed
for
pine
bluff
and
evidently
out
for
a
solitary
walk
olivia
copeland
wait
a
moment
patty
called
are
you
going
for
a
walk
may
i
come
too
she
asked
as
she
panted
up
behind
olivia
assented
with
evident
surprise
and
patty
fell
into
step
beside
her
i
just
found
out
yesterday
that
you
live
in
sorrento
and
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
i
was
there
myself
once
and
i
think
it
the
most
glorious
spot
on
earth
olivia
eyes
shone
really
she
gasped
oh
i
so
glad
and
before
she
knew
it
she
was
telling
patty
the
story
of
how
she
had
come
to
college
to
please
her
father
and
how
she
loved
italy
and
hated
america
and
what
she
did
not
tell
about
her
loneliness
and
homesickness
patty
divined
she
realized
that
the
girl
remarkable
and
she
determined
in
the
future
to
take
an
interest
in
her
and
make
her
like
college
but
a
senior
life
is
busy
and
taken
up
with
its
own
affairs
and
for
the
next
week
or
two
patty
saw
little
of
the
freshman
beyond
an
occasional
chat
in
the
corridors
one
evening
she
and
priscilla
had
returned
late
from
a
dinner
in
town
to
be
confronted
by
a
dark
room
and
an
empty
wait
a
moment
and
i
get
some
matches
said
patty
and
she
knocked
on
a
door
across
the
corridor
where
a
freshman
lived
with
whom
they
had
a
borrowing
acquaintance
she
found
within
her
own
freshman
friends
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
and
emily
washburn
it
was
evident
by
the
three
heads
close
together
and
the
hush
that
fell
on
the
group
as
she
entered
that
some
momentous
piece
of
gossip
had
been
interrupted
patty
forgot
her
waiting
in
the
dark
and
dropped
into
a
chair
with
the
evident
purpose
of
staying
out
the
evening
tell
me
all
about
it
children
she
said
cordially
the
freshmen
looked
at
one
another
and
hesitated
a
new
president
patty
suggested
or
just
a
class
mutiny
it
about
olivia
copeland
lady
clara
returned
dubiously
but
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
say
anything
olivia
copeland
patty
straightened
up
with
a
new
interest
in
her
eyes
what
olivia
copeland
been
doing
she
been
flunking
and
flunking
patty
face
was
blank
but
i
thought
she
was
so
bright
oh
she
is
bright
only
you
know
she
has
a
way
of
making
people
find
it
out
and
besides
lady
clara
added
with
meaning
emphasis
she
was
scared
over
examinations
patty
cast
a
quick
look
at
her
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
lady
clara
was
fond
of
patty
but
she
was
only
human
and
she
had
been
frightened
herself
well
she
explained
she
had
heard
a
lot
of
stories
from
er
about
how
hard
the
examinations
are
and
the
awful
things
they
do
to
you
if
you
do
pass
and
being
a
stranger
she
believed
them
of
course
emily
and
i
knew
better
but
she
was
just
scared
to
death
and
she
went
all
to
pieces
and
nonsense
said
patty
impatiently
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
if
it
had
been
a
sophomore
that
had
tried
to
frighten
us
pursued
lady
clara
we
should
have
minded
so
much
but
a
senior
now
patty
are
you
sorry
that
you
told
us
all
those
things
asked
emily
patty
laughed
for
the
matter
of
that
i
never
say
anything
i
not
sorry
for
half
an
hour
later
i
going
to
get
out
a
book
some
day
entitled
i
wish
i
had
said
a
collection
of
by
patty
wyatt
i
think
it
more
than
a
when
you
frighten
a
girl
so
she
i
suppose
you
think
you
rubbing
it
in
said
patty
imperturbably
but
girls
do
flunk
because
they
frightened
they
flunk
because
they
do
know
olivia
knew
five
times
as
much
geometry
as
i
did
and
i
got
through
and
she
did
patty
examined
the
carpet
in
silence
she
thinks
she
going
to
be
dropped
and
she
just
crying
terribly
pursued
emily
with
a
certain
relish
in
the
details
crying
said
patty
sharply
what
she
crying
for
because
she
feels
bad
i
suppose
she
been
out
walking
and
got
caught
in
the
rain
and
she
did
get
back
in
time
for
dinner
and
then
found
those
notes
waiting
for
her
she
up
there
lying
on
the
bed
and
she
got
hysterics
or
roman
fever
or
something
like
that
she
told
us
to
go
away
and
let
her
alone
she
awfully
cross
all
of
a
sudden
patty
rose
i
think
i
go
and
cheer
her
up
let
her
alone
patty
said
emily
i
know
the
way
you
cheer
people
up
if
you
had
cheered
her
up
before
examinations
she
would
have
flunked
i
did
know
anything
about
her
then
said
patty
a
trifle
sulkily
and
anyway
she
added
as
she
opened
the
door
i
did
say
anything
that
affected
her
passing
one
way
or
the
other
she
turned
toward
olivia
room
however
with
a
conscience
that
was
not
quite
comfortable
she
could
not
remember
just
what
she
told
those
freshmen
about
examinations
but
she
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
it
might
not
have
been
of
a
reassuring
nature
i
wish
i
could
ever
learn
when
it
is
time
for
joking
and
when
it
is
not
she
said
to
herself
as
she
knocked
on
the
study
door
no
one
answered
and
she
turned
the
knob
and
entered
a
stifled
sob
came
from
one
of
the
bedrooms
and
patty
hesitated
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
crying
herself
and
she
always
felt
uncomfortable
when
other
people
did
it
something
must
be
done
however
and
she
advanced
to
the
threshold
and
silently
regarded
olivia
who
was
stretched
face
downward
on
the
bed
at
the
sound
of
patty
step
she
raised
her
head
and
cast
a
startled
glance
at
the
intruder
and
then
buried
her
face
in
the
pillows
again
patty
scribbled
an
engaged
sign
and
pinned
it
on
the
study
door
and
drawing
up
a
chair
beside
the
bed
she
sat
down
with
the
air
of
a
physician
about
to
make
a
diagnosis
well
olivia
she
began
in
a
tone
what
is
the
trouble
olivia
opened
her
hands
and
disclosed
some
crumpled
papers
patty
spread
them
out
and
hastily
ran
her
eyes
over
the
official
printed
slips
miss
is
hereby
informed
that
she
has
been
found
deficient
in
hours
miss
is
hereby
informed
that
she
has
been
found
deficient
in
hour
miss
is
hereby
informed
that
she
has
been
found
deficient
in
hours
patty
performed
a
rapid
calculation
three
and
one
are
four
and
four
are
eight
and
knit
her
brows
will
they
send
me
home
patty
mercy
no
child
i
hope
not
a
person
who
done
as
good
work
as
you
in
english
ought
to
have
the
right
to
flunk
every
other
blessed
thing
if
she
wants
to
but
you
dropped
if
you
flunk
eight
hours
you
told
me
so
yourself
do
believe
anything
i
told
you
said
patty
reassuringly
i
know
what
i
talking
about
more
than
half
the
time
i
hate
to
be
sent
back
and
have
my
father
know
i
failed
when
he
spent
so
much
time
preparing
me
but
olivia
began
to
cry
again
i
want
to
go
back
so
much
that
i
do
believe
i
care
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
said
patty
she
put
her
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
mercy
child
you
sopping
wet
and
shivering
sit
up
and
take
those
shoes
off
olivia
sat
up
and
pulled
at
the
laces
with
ineffectual
fingers
and
patty
jerked
them
open
and
dumped
the
shoes
in
a
squashy
heap
on
the
floor
do
you
know
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
you
not
crying
because
you
flunked
you
crying
because
you
caught
cold
and
you
tired
and
wet
and
hungry
you
take
those
wet
clothes
off
this
minute
and
get
into
a
warm
and
i
get
you
some
dinner
i
do
want
any
dinner
wailed
olivia
and
she
showed
signs
of
turning
back
to
the
pillows
again
do
act
like
a
baby
olivia
said
patty
sharply
sit
up
and
be
a
a
man
ten
minutes
later
patty
returned
from
a
successful
looting
expedition
and
deposited
her
spoils
on
the
bedroom
table
olivia
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
watched
her
apathetically
a
picture
of
shivering
despondency
drink
this
commanded
patty
as
she
extended
a
steaming
glass
olivia
obediently
raised
it
to
her
lips
and
drew
back
what
in
it
she
asked
faintly
everything
i
could
find
that
hot
quinine
and
whisky
and
jamaica
ginger
and
cough
syrup
and
a
dash
of
red
pepper
and
one
or
two
other
things
it
my
own
idea
you
ca
take
cold
after
i
i
do
believe
i
want
any
drink
it
every
drop
said
patty
grimly
and
olivia
shut
her
eyes
and
gulped
it
down
now
said
patty
cheerfully
bustling
about
i
get
dinner
have
you
a
and
any
alcohol
by
chance
that
nice
we
have
three
courses
canned
soup
canned
baked
beans
and
preserved
ginger
all
of
them
hot
it
mighty
lucky
georgie
merriles
was
in
new
york
or
never
have
lent
them
to
me
olivia
to
her
own
astonishment
presently
found
herself
laughing
she
had
thought
that
she
would
never
smile
again
as
she
sipped
mulligatawny
soup
from
a
and
balanced
a
of
steaming
baked
beans
on
her
knee
and
now
said
patty
as
the
three
courses
disposed
of
she
tucked
the
freshman
into
bed
we
map
out
a
campaign
while
eight
hours
are
pretty
serious
they
are
not
of
necessity
deadly
what
made
you
flunk
latin
prose
i
never
had
any
before
i
came
and
when
i
told
miss
certainly
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
flunk
you
you
should
have
mentioned
the
subject
but
never
mind
it
only
one
hour
and
it
take
you
a
minute
to
work
it
off
how
about
german
german
a
little
hard
because
it
so
different
from
italian
and
french
you
know
and
i
sort
of
frightened
when
she
calls
on
me
and
pretty
stupid
on
the
whole
patty
suggested
i
afraid
i
am
she
confessed
well
i
dare
say
you
deserved
to
flunk
in
that
you
can
tutor
it
up
and
pass
it
off
in
the
spring
how
about
geometry
i
thought
i
knew
that
only
she
did
ask
what
i
expected
and
an
unfortunate
circumstance
but
it
will
happen
could
you
review
it
up
a
little
and
take
a
reëxamination
right
away
yes
i
sure
i
could
only
they
wo
give
me
another
chance
send
me
home
first
who
your
instructor
miss
prescott
patty
frowned
and
then
she
laughed
i
thought
if
it
were
miss
hawley
i
could
go
to
her
and
explain
the
matter
and
ask
her
to
give
you
a
reëxamination
miss
hawley
occasionally
human
but
miss
prescott
no
wonder
you
flunked
i
afraid
of
her
myself
she
the
only
woman
that
ever
got
a
degree
at
some
german
university
and
she
simply
has
a
thought
in
the
world
beyond
mathematics
i
do
believe
the
woman
has
any
soul
if
one
of
those
mediums
should
come
here
and
dematerialize
her
all
that
would
be
left
would
be
an
equilateral
triangle
patty
shook
her
head
i
afraid
there
not
much
use
in
arguing
with
a
person
like
that
if
she
once
sees
a
truth
you
know
she
sees
it
for
all
time
but
never
mind
i
do
the
best
i
can
i
tell
her
an
undiscovered
mathematical
genius
that
it
latent
but
if
examine
you
again
she
find
it
that
ought
to
appeal
to
her
go
to
sleep
and
do
worry
i
manage
her
good
night
and
thank
you
patty
called
a
tolerably
cheerful
voice
from
under
the
covers
patty
closed
the
door
and
stood
a
moment
in
the
hall
pondering
the
situation
olivia
copeland
was
too
valuable
to
throw
away
the
college
must
be
made
to
realize
her
worth
but
that
was
difficult
patty
had
tried
to
make
the
college
realize
things
before
miss
prescott
was
the
only
means
of
salvation
that
she
could
think
of
and
miss
prescott
was
a
doubtful
means
she
did
not
at
all
relish
the
prospect
of
calling
on
her
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
to
do
she
made
a
little
grimace
and
laughed
i
acting
like
a
freshman
myself
she
thought
walk
up
patty
and
face
the
guns
and
without
giving
herself
time
to
hesitate
she
marched
and
knocked
on
miss
prescott
door
she
reflected
after
she
had
knocked
that
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
politic
to
have
postponed
her
business
until
the
morrow
but
the
door
opened
before
she
had
time
to
run
away
and
she
found
herself
rather
confusedly
bowing
to
miss
prescott
who
held
in
her
hand
not
a
book
on
calculus
but
a
common
magazine
good
evening
miss
wyatt
wo
you
come
in
and
sit
down
said
miss
prescott
in
a
very
cordially
human
tone
as
she
sank
into
a
deep
rush
chair
patty
had
a
blurred
vision
of
low
bookcases
pictures
rugs
and
polished
brass
thrown
into
soft
relief
by
a
shaded
lamp
which
stood
on
the
table
before
she
had
time
to
mentally
shake
herself
and
reconstruct
her
ideas
she
was
gaily
chatting
to
miss
prescott
about
the
probable
outcome
of
a
serial
story
in
the
magazine
miss
prescott
did
not
seem
to
wonder
in
the
least
at
this
unusual
visit
but
talked
along
easily
on
various
subjects
and
laughed
and
told
stories
like
the
humanest
of
human
beings
patty
watched
her
fascinated
she
she
thought
to
herself
and
she
began
to
wonder
how
old
she
was
never
before
had
she
associated
any
age
whatever
with
miss
prescott
she
had
regarded
her
much
in
the
same
light
as
a
scientific
truth
which
exists
but
is
quite
irrespective
of
time
or
place
she
tried
to
recall
some
story
that
had
been
handed
about
among
the
girls
her
freshman
year
she
remembered
vaguely
that
it
had
in
it
the
suggestion
that
miss
prescott
had
once
been
in
love
at
the
time
patty
had
scoffingly
repudiated
the
idea
but
now
she
was
half
willing
to
believe
it
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
the
bell
rang
and
patty
recalled
her
errand
with
a
start
i
suppose
she
said
you
are
wondering
why
i
came
i
was
hoping
said
miss
prescott
with
a
smile
that
it
was
just
to
see
me
without
any
ulterior
motive
it
will
be
the
next
time
if
you
will
let
me
come
again
but
i
had
another
reason
which
i
afraid
you
think
impertinent
and
she
added
frankly
i
do
know
just
what
the
best
way
to
tell
it
so
that
you
think
it
impertinent
tell
it
to
me
any
way
you
please
and
i
will
try
not
to
think
so
said
miss
prescott
kindly
do
you
think
sometimes
the
girls
can
tell
more
of
one
ability
than
the
instructors
patty
asked
i
know
a
girl
she
continued
a
freshman
who
is
in
some
ways
the
most
remarkable
person
i
have
ever
met
of
course
i
ca
be
sure
but
i
should
say
that
she
is
going
to
be
very
good
in
english
some
day
so
good
you
know
that
the
college
will
be
proud
of
her
well
this
girl
has
flunked
such
a
lot
that
i
am
afraid
she
is
in
danger
of
being
sent
home
and
the
college
simply
ca
afford
to
lose
her
i
do
know
anything
about
your
rules
of
course
but
what
seems
to
me
the
easiest
way
is
for
you
to
give
her
another
examination
in
geometry
immediately
she
really
knows
it
and
then
tell
the
faculty
about
her
and
urge
them
to
give
her
another
trial
patty
brought
out
this
astounding
request
in
the
most
way
possible
and
the
corners
of
miss
prescott
mouth
twitched
as
she
asked
of
whom
are
you
speaking
olivia
copeland
miss
prescott
mouth
grew
firm
and
she
looked
like
the
instructor
in
mathematics
again
miss
copeland
did
absolutely
nothing
on
her
examination
miss
wyatt
and
what
little
she
has
recited
during
the
year
does
not
betoken
any
unusual
ability
i
am
sorry
but
it
would
be
impossible
but
miss
prescott
patty
expostulated
the
girl
has
worked
under
such
peculiar
disadvantages
she
an
american
but
she
lives
abroad
and
all
our
ways
are
new
to
her
she
has
never
been
to
school
a
day
in
her
life
her
father
prepared
her
for
college
and
of
course
not
in
the
same
way
that
the
other
girls
have
been
prepared
she
is
shy
and
not
being
used
to
reciting
in
a
class
she
does
know
how
to
show
off
i
am
sure
miss
prescott
that
if
you
would
take
her
and
examine
her
yourself
you
would
find
that
she
understands
the
work
that
is
if
you
would
let
her
get
over
being
afraid
of
you
first
i
know
you
busy
and
it
asking
a
good
deal
patty
finished
apologetically
it
is
not
that
miss
wyatt
for
of
course
i
do
not
wish
to
mark
any
student
unjustly
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
you
have
overestimated
miss
copeland
ability
she
has
really
had
a
chance
to
show
what
is
in
her
and
if
she
has
failed
in
as
many
courses
as
you
say
the
college
you
know
must
keep
up
the
standard
of
its
work
and
in
questions
like
this
it
is
not
always
possible
to
consider
the
individual
patty
felt
that
she
was
being
dismissed
and
she
groped
about
wildly
for
a
new
plea
her
eye
caught
a
framed
picture
of
the
old
monastery
of
amalfi
hanging
over
the
bookcase
perhaps
you
lived
in
italy
she
asked
miss
prescott
started
slightly
no
she
said
but
i
spent
some
time
there
that
picture
of
amalfi
up
there
made
me
think
of
it
olivia
copeland
you
know
lives
near
there
at
sorrento
a
gleam
of
interest
flashed
into
miss
prescott
eye
that
how
i
first
came
to
notice
her
continued
patty
but
she
did
interest
me
so
much
until
i
talked
to
her
it
seems
that
her
father
is
an
artist
and
she
was
born
in
italy
and
has
only
visited
america
once
when
she
was
a
little
girl
her
mother
is
dead
and
she
and
her
father
live
in
an
old
villa
on
that
road
along
the
coast
leading
to
sorrento
she
has
never
had
any
girl
friends
just
her
friends
artists
and
diplomats
and
people
like
that
she
speaks
italian
and
she
knows
all
about
italian
art
and
politics
and
the
church
and
the
agrarian
laws
and
how
the
people
are
taxed
and
all
the
peasants
around
sorrento
are
her
friends
she
is
so
homesick
that
she
nearly
dies
and
the
only
person
here
that
she
can
talk
to
about
the
things
she
is
interested
in
is
the
peanut
man
illustration
olivia
copeland
the
girls
she
rooms
with
are
just
nice
exuberant
american
girls
and
are
interested
in
golf
and
and
welsh
rabbit
and
richard
harding
davis
stories
and
gibson
pictures
and
she
never
even
of
any
of
them
until
four
months
ago
she
has
a
sketch
of
the
villa
that
her
father
did
it
white
stucco
you
know
with
terraces
and
marble
balustrades
and
broken
statues
and
a
grove
of
with
a
fountain
in
the
center
just
think
of
to
a
place
like
that
miss
prescott
and
then
being
suddenly
plunged
into
a
place
like
this
without
any
friends
or
any
one
who
even
knows
about
the
things
you
know
think
how
lonely
you
would
be
patty
leaned
forward
with
flushed
cheeks
carried
away
by
her
own
eloquence
you
know
what
italy
like
it
a
sort
of
disease
if
you
once
get
fond
of
it
you
never
forget
it
and
you
just
ca
be
happy
till
you
get
back
and
with
olivia
it
her
home
besides
she
never
known
anything
else
and
it
hard
at
first
to
keep
your
mind
on
mathematics
when
you
dreaming
all
the
time
of
ilex
groves
and
fountains
and
nightingales
and
and
things
like
that
she
finished
lamely
for
miss
prescott
suddenly
leaned
back
in
the
shadow
and
it
seemed
to
patty
that
her
face
had
grown
pale
and
the
hand
that
held
the
magazine
trembled
patty
flushed
uncomfortably
and
tried
to
think
what
she
had
said
she
was
always
saying
things
that
hurt
people
feelings
without
meaning
to
suddenly
that
old
story
from
her
freshman
year
flashed
into
her
mind
he
had
been
an
artist
and
had
lived
in
italy
and
had
died
of
roman
fever
and
miss
prescott
had
gone
to
germany
to
study
mathematics
and
had
never
cared
for
anything
else
since
it
sounded
rather
made
up
but
it
might
be
true
had
she
stumbled
on
a
forbidden
subject
she
wondered
miserably
she
had
of
course
it
was
just
her
way
the
silence
was
becoming
unbearable
she
struggled
to
think
of
something
to
say
but
nothing
came
and
she
rose
abruptly
i
sorry
to
have
taken
so
much
of
your
time
miss
prescott
i
hope
i
have
bored
you
good
night
miss
prescott
rose
and
took
patty
hand
good
night
my
dear
and
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
i
am
glad
to
know
of
olivia
copeland
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
about
her
geometry
and
i
shall
be
glad
besides
to
know
her
as
as
a
friend
for
i
too
once
cared
for
italy
patty
closed
the
door
softly
and
tiptoed
home
through
the
dim
corridors
did
you
bring
the
matches
called
a
sleepy
voice
from
bedroom
patty
started
oh
the
matches
she
laughed
no
i
forgot
them
i
never
knew
you
to
accomplish
anything
yet
that
you
started
out
to
do
patty
wyatt
i
accomplished
something
just
the
same
patty
retorted
with
a
little
note
of
triumph
in
her
voice
but
i
have
an
idea
how
i
happened
to
do
it
she
added
frankly
to
herself
and
she
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
quite
unaware
of
how
much
she
accomplished
for
unconsciously
she
had
laid
the
foundation
of
a
friendship
which
was
to
make
happy
the
future
of
a
lonely
freshman
and
an
equally
lonely
instructor
xi
local
color
the
third
senior
table
had
discovered
a
new
amusement
with
which
to
enlighten
the
tedium
of
waiting
while
maggie
was
in
the
kitchen
foraging
for
food
the
game
was
called
local
color
in
honor
of
patty
famous
definition
in
english
class
local
color
is
that
which
makes
a
lie
seem
truthful
the
object
of
the
game
was
to
see
who
could
tell
the
biggest
lie
without
being
found
out
and
the
one
rule
required
that
the
victims
be
disillusionized
before
they
left
the
table
patty
was
the
instigator
the
champion
player
and
the
final
victim
of
the
game
baron
münchhausen
himself
would
have
blushed
at
some
of
her
creations
and
her
stories
were
told
with
such
an
air
of
ingenuous
honesty
that
the
most
outrageous
among
them
obtained
credence
the
game
in
its
original
conception
may
have
been
innocent
enough
but
the
rule
was
not
always
as
carefully
observed
as
it
should
have
been
and
the
most
unaccountable
scandals
began
to
float
about
college
the
president
of
christians
had
been
called
up
for
cutting
chapel
the
shark
of
the
class
had
flunked
her
ethics
and
even
failed
to
get
through
on
the
re
cathy
fair
was
an
own
cousin
of
professor
hitchcock
and
called
him
tommy
to
his
face
these
and
far
worse
were
becoming
public
property
and
even
personal
fabrications
in
regard
to
the
faculty
intended
solely
for
undergraduate
consumption
were
reaching
the
ears
of
the
faculty
themselves
one
day
patty
dropped
into
an
room
on
some
committee
work
and
she
found
the
children
in
the
manner
of
their
elders
regaling
themselves
on
dainty
bits
of
college
gossip
i
heard
the
funniest
thing
about
professor
winters
yesterday
piped
up
a
sophomore
tell
it
to
us
what
was
it
cried
a
chorus
of
voices
i
like
to
hear
something
funny
about
professor
winters
he
the
man
i
ever
saw
remarked
a
freshman
well
resumed
the
sophomore
it
seems
he
was
going
to
get
married
last
week
and
the
invitations
were
all
out
and
the
presents
all
there
when
the
bride
came
down
with
the
mumps
really
how
funny
came
in
a
chorus
from
the
delighted
auditors
yes
on
both
sides
and
the
clergyman
had
never
had
it
so
the
ceremony
had
to
be
postponed
patty
blood
froze
she
recognized
the
tale
it
was
one
of
her
own
offspring
only
shorn
of
its
unessential
adornments
where
in
the
world
did
you
hear
any
such
absurd
thing
as
that
she
demanded
severely
i
heard
lucille
carter
tell
it
at
a
fudge
party
up
in
bonnie
connaught
room
last
night
answered
the
sophomore
stoutly
sure
that
the
source
was
a
reputable
one
patty
groaned
and
i
suppose
that
every
blessed
one
of
that
dozen
girls
has
told
it
to
another
dozen
by
this
time
and
that
it
only
bounded
by
the
boundaries
of
the
campus
well
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
lucille
carter
does
know
what
she
is
talking
about
that
a
likely
story
is
it
she
added
with
fine
scorn
does
professor
winters
look
like
a
man
who
ever
dare
propose
to
a
girl
let
alone
marry
her
and
she
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
up
to
the
single
where
lucille
lived
lucille
said
patty
what
do
you
mean
by
spreading
that
story
about
professor
winters
bride
mumps
you
told
it
to
me
yourself
answered
lucille
with
some
warmth
she
was
a
believing
creature
with
an
essentially
literal
mind
and
she
had
always
been
out
of
her
element
in
the
lofty
imaginative
realms
of
local
color
i
told
it
to
you
said
patty
indignantly
you
goose
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
believed
it
i
was
just
playing
local
color
how
should
i
know
that
you
told
it
as
if
it
were
true
of
course
said
patty
that
the
game
you
would
have
believed
me
if
i
had
but
you
never
said
it
was
true
you
do
follow
the
rule
i
did
think
it
was
necessary
i
never
supposed
any
one
would
believe
any
such
absurd
story
as
that
i
do
see
how
it
was
my
fault
of
course
it
was
your
fault
you
should
be
spreading
malicious
tales
about
the
faculty
it
irreverent
the
story
all
over
college
by
this
time
and
professor
winters
has
probably
heard
it
himself
he
flunk
you
on
the
finals
to
pay
for
it
see
if
he
does
and
patty
went
home
leaving
a
and
thoroughly
indignant
lucille
behind
her
about
a
month
before
the
introduction
of
local
color
patty
had
entered
upon
a
new
activity
which
she
referred
to
impartially
as
molding
public
opinion
and
elevating
the
press
the
way
of
it
was
this
the
college
which
was
a
modest
and
retiring
institution
craving
only
to
be
unmolested
in
its
atmosphere
of
academic
calm
had
been
recently
exploited
by
a
sensational
newspaper
the
fact
that
none
of
the
stories
was
true
did
not
mitigate
the
annoyance
the
college
was
besieged
by
reporters
who
had
heard
rumors
and
wished
to
have
them
corroborated
for
exclusive
publication
in
the
censor
or
advertiser
or
star
and
they
would
also
like
a
photograph
of
miss
bentley
as
she
appeared
in
the
character
of
portia
and
since
she
refused
to
give
it
to
them
they
stated
their
intention
of
faking
one
which
they
gallantly
assured
her
would
be
far
homelier
than
the
original
the
climax
was
reached
when
bonnie
connaught
was
unfortunate
enough
to
sprain
her
ankle
in
something
more
than
a
portrait
of
her
clothed
in
a
sweater
with
a
under
her
arm
appeared
in
a
new
york
evening
paper
and
three
inches
high
announced
in
red
ink
that
the
champion
athlete
and
most
popular
society
girl
in
college
was
at
death
door
owing
to
injuries
received
in
bonnie
eminently
respectable
family
descended
upon
the
college
in
an
indignant
body
for
the
purpose
of
taking
her
home
and
were
with
difficulty
soothed
by
an
equally
indignant
faculty
the
alumnæ
wrote
that
in
their
day
such
brutal
games
as
had
not
been
countenanced
and
that
they
feared
the
college
had
deteriorated
parents
wrote
that
they
would
remove
their
daughters
from
college
if
they
were
to
be
subjected
to
such
publicity
and
the
poor
president
was
of
course
quite
helpless
before
the
glorious
american
privilege
of
free
speech
finally
the
college
hit
upon
a
partially
protective
measure
that
of
furnishing
its
own
news
and
a
regularly
organized
newspaper
corps
was
formed
among
the
students
with
a
member
of
the
faculty
at
the
head
the
more
respectable
of
the
papers
were
very
glad
to
have
a
correspondent
from
the
inside
whose
facts
needed
no
investigation
and
the
less
respectable
in
due
time
betook
themselves
to
more
fruitful
fields
of
scandal
and
happily
forgot
the
existence
of
the
college
patty
having
the
reputation
of
being
an
english
shark
had
been
duly
empaneled
and
presented
with
a
local
paper
at
first
she
had
been
filled
with
a
fit
sense
of
the
responsibility
of
the
position
and
had
conscientiously
neglected
her
college
work
for
its
sake
but
in
time
the
novelty
wore
off
and
her
weekly
budgets
became
more
and
more
perfunctory
in
character
the
choice
of
patty
for
this
particular
paper
perhaps
had
not
been
very
for
the
editor
wished
a
column
a
week
of
what
he
designated
as
chatty
news
whereas
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
given
her
a
city
paper
which
required
only
a
brief
statement
of
important
facts
patty
own
tendencies
it
must
be
confessed
had
a
slightly
yellow
tinge
and
with
a
delighted
editor
egging
her
on
it
was
hard
for
her
to
suppress
her
latent
love
for
local
color
the
paper
however
had
a
wide
circulation
among
the
faculty
which
circumstance
tended
to
have
a
chastening
effect
the
day
following
patty
contretemps
with
lucille
happened
to
be
friday
and
she
was
painfully
engaged
in
her
weekly
molding
of
public
opinion
it
had
been
a
barren
week
and
there
was
nothing
to
write
about
she
reviewed
at
length
a
set
of
french
encyclopedias
which
had
been
given
to
the
library
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
a
remarkable
collection
of
of
the
prehistoric
cow
which
had
been
presented
to
the
department
of
paleontology
she
gave
in
full
the
list
of
the
seventeen
girls
who
had
been
honored
with
scholarships
laboriously
writing
out
their
full
names
with
miss
attached
to
each
and
the
name
of
the
town
and
the
state
in
its
unabbreviated
length
and
still
it
only
mounted
up
to
ten
pages
and
it
took
eighteen
of
patty
writing
to
make
a
column
she
strolled
down
to
examine
the
again
and
discovered
a
new
notice
which
she
had
overlooked
before
friday
january
professor
james
harkner
wallis
of
the
lick
observatory
will
lecture
in
the
auditorium
at
eight
upon
theories
of
the
sidereal
system
patty
regarded
the
notice
without
emotion
it
did
not
look
capable
of
expansion
and
she
did
not
feel
the
remotest
interest
in
the
sidereal
system
the
brief
account
of
the
lecturer
however
which
was
appended
to
the
notice
stated
that
professor
wallis
was
one
of
the
best
known
of
living
astronomers
and
that
he
had
conducted
important
original
investigations
if
i
knew
anything
about
astronomy
she
thought
desperately
i
might
be
able
to
spread
him
out
over
two
pages
an
acquaintance
of
patty
strolled
up
to
the
did
you
ever
hear
of
that
man
asked
patty
pointing
to
the
notice
never
but
i
not
an
astronomer
i
not
either
said
patty
i
wonder
who
he
is
she
added
wistfully
it
seems
he
very
famous
and
i
really
like
to
know
something
about
him
the
girl
opened
her
eyes
in
some
surprise
at
this
thirst
for
gratuitous
information
it
did
not
accord
with
patty
reputation
and
ever
after
when
it
was
affirmed
in
her
presence
that
patty
wyatt
was
brilliant
but
superficial
she
stoutly
maintained
that
patty
was
deeper
than
people
thought
she
pondered
a
moment
and
then
returned
lucille
carter
takes
astronomy
she
could
tell
you
about
him
so
she
does
i
forgotten
it
and
patty
swung
off
toward
room
she
found
a
number
of
girls
sitting
around
on
the
various
pieces
of
furniture
eating
fudge
and
discussing
the
tragedies
of
one
maeterlinck
what
this
said
patty
a
party
oh
no
said
lucille
just
an
extra
session
of
the
dramatic
theory
class
do
be
afraid
there
your
up
on
the
hello
pris
what
are
you
doing
here
said
patty
dipping
out
some
fudge
with
a
spoon
there
had
been
a
disagreement
as
to
how
long
it
should
boil
just
paying
a
social
call
what
are
you
doing
i
thought
you
were
going
to
hurry
up
and
get
through
so
you
could
go
to
dinner
i
am
said
patty
vaguely
but
i
got
lonely
the
conversation
drifting
off
to
maeterlinck
again
she
seized
the
opportunity
to
inquire
of
lucille
who
this
astronomy
man
going
to
lecture
he
quite
famous
is
he
very
said
lucille
professor
phelps
has
been
talking
about
him
every
day
for
the
last
week
where
the
lick
observatory
anyway
pursued
patty
i
remember
for
the
life
of
me
whether
it
in
california
or
on
peak
lucille
considered
a
moment
it
in
dublin
ireland
dublin
ireland
asked
patty
in
some
surprise
i
could
have
sworn
that
it
was
in
california
are
you
sure
you
know
where
it
is
lucille
of
course
i
sure
have
we
been
having
it
for
three
days
steady
california
you
must
be
crazy
patty
i
think
you
better
elect
astronomy
i
know
it
said
patty
meekly
i
was
going
to
but
i
heard
that
it
was
terribly
hard
and
i
thought
senior
year
you
have
a
right
to
take
something
a
little
easy
but
you
know
that
the
funniest
thing
about
the
lick
observatory
for
i
really
know
a
lot
about
it
read
an
article
on
it
just
a
little
while
ago
and
i
do
know
how
i
got
the
impression
but
i
was
almost
sure
it
was
in
the
united
states
it
just
shows
that
you
can
never
be
sure
of
anything
no
said
lucille
it
is
safe
is
it
connected
with
dublin
university
asked
patty
i
believe
so
said
lucille
and
this
astronomy
person
continued
patty
warming
to
her
work
i
suppose
he
an
irishman
then
of
course
said
lucille
he
very
noted
what
he
done
asked
patty
it
said
on
the
he
made
some
important
discoveries
i
suppose
though
they
frightful
technicalities
that
no
one
ever
heard
of
well
said
lucille
considering
he
discovered
the
rings
of
saturn
and
the
milky
way
the
rings
of
saturn
why
i
thought
those
had
been
discovered
ago
he
must
be
a
terribly
old
man
i
remember
reading
about
them
when
i
was
an
infant
in
arms
it
was
a
good
while
ago
said
lucille
eight
or
nine
years
at
least
and
the
milky
way
continued
patty
with
a
show
of
incredulity
i
do
see
how
people
could
have
helped
discovering
that
long
ago
i
could
have
done
it
myself
and
i
do
pretend
to
know
anything
about
astronomy
oh
of
course
lucille
hastened
to
explain
the
phenomenon
had
been
observed
before
but
had
never
been
accounted
for
i
see
said
patty
surreptitiously
taking
notes
he
must
really
be
an
awfully
important
man
how
did
he
happen
to
do
all
this
he
went
up
in
a
balloon
said
lucille
vaguely
a
balloon
what
fun
exclaimed
patty
her
reportorial
instinct
waking
to
the
scent
they
use
balloons
a
lot
more
in
europe
than
they
do
here
i
believe
he
has
his
balloon
with
him
here
in
america
said
lucille
he
never
travels
without
it
what
the
good
of
it
inquired
patty
i
suppose
she
continued
furnishing
her
own
explanation
it
gets
him
such
a
lot
nearer
to
the
stars
that
without
doubt
the
reason
said
lucille
i
wish
he
send
it
up
here
sighed
patty
do
you
know
any
more
interesting
details
about
him
n
no
said
lucille
i
ca
think
of
any
more
at
present
he
certainly
the
most
interesting
professor
i
ever
heard
of
said
patty
and
it
strange
i
never
heard
of
him
before
there
seem
to
be
a
good
many
things
you
have
never
heard
of
observed
lucille
yes
acknowledged
patty
there
are
well
patty
said
priscilla
emerging
from
the
discussion
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
if
you
going
to
dinner
with
me
you
better
stop
fooling
with
lucille
and
go
home
and
get
your
work
done
very
well
said
patty
rising
with
obliging
promptitude
girls
come
and
see
me
and
i
give
you
some
fudge
that
done
thank
you
for
the
information
she
called
back
to
lucille
the
monday
afternoon
following
patty
and
priscilla
with
two
or
three
other
girls
came
strolling
back
from
the
lake
jingling
their
skates
over
their
arms
come
in
girls
and
have
some
hot
tea
said
priscilla
as
they
reached
the
study
door
here
a
note
for
patty
said
bonnie
connaught
picking
up
an
envelop
from
the
table
terribly
must
have
come
in
the
college
mail
open
it
patty
and
let
see
what
you
flunked
dear
me
said
patty
i
thought
that
was
a
habit
i
outgrown
freshman
year
they
crowded
around
and
read
the
note
over
her
shoulder
patty
had
no
secrets
the
observatory
january
miss
patty
wyatt
dear
miss
wyatt
i
am
informed
that
you
are
the
correspondent
for
the
saturday
evening
and
i
take
the
liberty
of
calling
your
attention
to
a
rather
grave
error
which
occurred
in
last
week
issue
you
stated
that
the
lick
observatory
is
in
dublin
ireland
while
as
is
a
matter
of
general
information
it
is
situated
near
san
francisco
california
professor
james
harkner
wallis
is
not
an
irishman
he
is
an
american
though
he
has
carried
on
some
very
important
investigations
he
is
the
discoverer
of
neither
the
rings
of
saturn
nor
the
milky
way
very
truly
yours
howard
phelps
it
from
professor
phelps
what
can
he
mean
said
the
twin
in
bewilderment
oh
patty
groaned
priscilla
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
actually
believed
all
that
stuff
of
course
i
believed
it
how
could
i
know
she
was
lying
she
was
lying
do
use
such
reckless
language
i
like
to
know
what
you
call
it
then
said
patty
angrily
local
color
my
dear
just
local
color
the
worm
will
turn
you
know
why
did
you
tell
me
wailed
patty
never
supposed
for
a
moment
you
believed
her
thought
you
were
joking
all
the
time
what
the
matter
patty
what
have
you
done
the
others
demanded
divided
between
a
pardonable
feeling
of
curiosity
and
a
sense
that
they
ought
to
retire
before
this
domestic
tragedy
oh
tell
them
said
patty
bitterly
tell
every
one
you
see
shout
it
from
the
dome
of
the
observatory
you
might
as
well
it
be
all
over
college
in
a
couple
of
hours
priscilla
explained
and
as
she
explained
the
funny
side
began
to
strike
her
by
the
time
she
had
finished
they
were
all
except
patty
reduced
to
hysterics
the
poor
editor
gurgled
priscilla
he
always
after
a
scoop
and
he
certainly
got
one
this
time
where
is
it
patty
the
paper
gasped
bonnie
i
threw
it
away
said
patty
sulkily
priscilla
rummaged
it
out
of
the
and
the
four
bent
over
it
delightedly
ireland
eminent
astronomer
spending
a
few
weeks
in
america
lecturing
at
the
principal
colleges
his
famous
discovery
of
the
rings
of
saturn
made
during
a
balloon
ascension
three
thousand
feet
in
the
air
though
this
is
his
first
visit
to
the
states
he
speaks
with
only
a
slight
brogue
loyal
son
of
old
erin
patty
patty
and
you
of
all
people
to
be
so
gullible
professor
james
harkner
wallis
parents
will
be
writing
to
prexy
next
to
say
that
their
son
ca
lecture
here
any
more
if
he
is
to
be
subjected
to
this
sort
of
thing
it
disgusting
said
bonnie
connaught
feelingly
when
you
got
through
laughing
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
to
do
tell
professor
phelps
it
was
a
slip
of
the
pen
a
slip
of
the
pen
to
the
extent
of
half
a
column
is
good
said
the
twin
i
think
you
girls
are
beastly
to
laugh
when
i
am
probably
being
expelled
this
minute
faculty
meeting
does
come
till
four
said
bonnie
patty
sat
down
by
the
desk
and
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
patty
said
priscilla
you
are
crying
are
you
no
said
patty
savagely
i
thinking
you
will
never
think
of
anything
that
will
explain
that
patty
looked
up
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
received
an
inspiration
i
going
to
tell
him
the
truth
do
do
anything
so
rash
pleaded
the
twin
that
is
of
course
the
only
thing
you
can
do
said
priscilla
sit
down
and
write
him
a
note
and
i
promise
not
to
laugh
till
you
get
through
patty
stood
up
i
think
she
said
i
go
and
see
him
oh
no
write
him
a
note
it
loads
easier
no
said
patty
with
dignity
i
think
i
owe
him
a
personal
explanation
is
my
hair
all
right
if
you
girls
reveal
this
to
a
single
person
before
i
come
back
i
not
tell
you
a
thing
he
says
she
added
as
she
closed
the
door
patty
returned
half
an
hour
later
just
as
they
were
finally
settling
down
to
tea
she
peered
around
the
darkening
room
finding
only
four
expectant
faces
she
leisurely
seated
herself
on
a
cushion
on
the
floor
and
stretched
out
her
hand
for
a
steaming
cup
what
did
he
say
what
kept
you
so
long
oh
i
stopped
in
the
office
to
change
my
electives
and
it
delayed
me
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
man
made
you
elect
astronomy
priscilla
asked
indignantly
certainly
not
said
patty
i
should
have
done
it
if
he
had
oh
patty
i
know
you
like
to
tease
but
i
think
it
odious
you
know
we
in
suspense
tell
us
what
happened
well
said
patty
placidly
gathering
her
skirts
about
her
i
told
him
exactly
how
it
was
i
did
hide
anything
not
even
the
bride
with
the
mumps
was
he
cross
or
did
he
laugh
he
laughed
said
patty
till
i
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
off
his
chair
and
i
looked
anxiously
around
for
some
water
and
a
he
really
has
a
surprising
sense
of
humor
for
a
member
of
the
faculty
was
he
nice
yes
said
patty
he
was
a
dear
when
he
got
through
discussing
universal
truth
i
asked
him
if
i
might
elect
astronomy
and
he
said
i
would
find
it
pretty
hard
the
second
semester
but
i
told
him
i
was
willing
to
work
and
he
said
i
really
showed
a
remarkable
aptitude
for
explaining
phenomena
and
that
if
i
were
in
earnest
he
would
be
glad
to
have
me
in
the
class
i
think
a
man
as
forgiving
as
that
to
be
elected
said
priscilla
you
certainly
have
more
courage
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
said
bonnie
i
never
could
have
gone
over
and
explained
to
that
man
in
the
wide
world
patty
smiled
discreetly
when
you
have
to
explain
to
a
woman
she
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
stating
a
natural
law
it
is
better
to
write
a
note
but
when
it
is
a
man
always
explain
in
person
xii
the
exigencies
of
etiquette
if
i
had
been
the
one
to
invent
etiquette
said
patty
i
should
have
made
party
calls
payable
one
year
after
date
and
then
should
have
allowed
three
days
grace
at
the
end
in
which
case
said
priscilla
i
suppose
you
would
get
out
of
calling
on
millard
altogether
exactly
said
patty
millard
more
familiarly
referred
to
as
prexy
annually
invited
the
seniors
to
dinner
in
parties
of
ten
patty
whose
turn
had
come
a
short
time
before
owing
to
an
untoward
misfortune
had
been
in
the
infirmary
at
the
time
but
though
she
had
missed
the
fun
she
now
found
it
necessary
to
pay
the
call
of
course
she
resumed
i
can
see
why
you
should
be
expected
to
call
if
you
attend
the
function
and
partake
of
the
food
but
what
i
understand
is
why
a
peaceable
citizen
who
desires
only
to
gang
his
ain
gait
should
upon
the
reception
of
an
entirely
unsolicited
invitation
suddenly
find
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
put
on
his
best
dress
and
his
best
hat
and
gloves
in
order
to
call
upon
people
he
barely
knows
your
genders
said
priscilla
are
a
trifle
mixed
that
said
patty
is
the
fault
of
the
language
the
logic
i
think
you
will
find
correct
you
can
see
what
would
happen
she
pursued
if
you
carry
it
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
suppose
for
instance
that
every
woman
i
have
ever
met
in
this
town
should
suddenly
take
it
into
her
head
to
invite
me
to
a
dinner
here
i
perfectly
unsuspicious
and
innocent
of
any
evil
because
of
a
purely
arbitrary
law
which
i
did
not
help
to
make
would
not
only
have
to
sit
down
and
write
a
hundred
regrets
but
would
have
to
pay
a
hundred
calls
within
the
next
two
weeks
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
it
i
do
believe
you
need
worry
about
it
patty
of
course
we
know
you
popular
but
you
not
as
popular
as
that
no
said
patty
i
did
mean
that
i
thought
i
really
get
that
many
invitations
it
only
that
one
is
open
to
the
constant
danger
during
the
progress
of
this
conversation
georgie
merriles
had
been
lounging
on
the
couch
by
the
window
reading
the
merchant
of
venice
in
a
critically
unimpassioned
way
that
the
instructor
in
dramatic
theory
could
not
have
praised
too
much
the
room
finally
having
become
too
dark
for
reading
she
threw
down
the
book
with
something
like
a
yawn
it
would
have
been
a
joke
on
portia
she
remarked
if
bassanio
had
chosen
the
wrong
casket
and
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
campus
outside
groups
of
girls
were
coming
along
the
path
from
the
lake
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
mingled
with
laughter
and
the
jingling
of
skates
floated
up
through
the
gathering
dusk
across
the
stretches
of
snow
and
bare
trees
lights
were
beginning
to
twinkle
in
the
other
dormitories
while
nearer
at
hand
and
more
clearly
visible
rose
the
irregular
outline
of
the
president
house
patty
said
georgie
with
her
nose
against
the
pane
if
you
really
want
to
get
that
call
out
of
the
way
now
your
chance
millard
has
just
gone
out
patty
dashed
into
her
bedroom
and
began
jerking
out
bureau
drawers
priscilla
she
called
in
an
agonized
tone
do
you
remember
where
i
keep
my
cards
it
ten
minutes
of
six
patty
you
ca
go
now
yes
i
can
it
does
matter
what
time
it
is
so
long
as
she
out
i
go
just
as
i
am
not
in
a
patty
hesitated
an
instant
well
she
admitted
i
suppose
the
butler
might
tell
her
i
put
on
a
hat
this
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
making
a
really
great
concession
some
more
banging
of
bureau
drawers
and
she
appeared
in
a
black
velvet
hat
trimmed
with
lace
with
the
brown
jacket
of
her
suit
over
her
red
blouse
and
a
blue
and
very
muddy
boots
showing
below
patty
you
a
disgrace
to
the
room
cried
priscilla
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
are
going
to
millard
in
a
short
skirt
and
those
awful
the
butler
wo
look
at
my
feet
i
so
beautiful
above
and
patty
banged
the
door
behind
her
georgie
and
priscilla
flattened
themselves
against
the
window
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
call
look
gasped
priscilla
there
millard
going
in
at
the
back
door
and
there
patty
my
but
she
looks
funny
call
her
back
cried
priscilla
wildly
trying
to
open
the
window
let
her
alone
laughed
georgie
it
will
be
such
fun
to
gloat
over
her
the
window
came
up
with
a
jerk
patty
patty
shrieked
priscilla
patty
turned
and
waved
her
hand
airily
ca
stop
now
will
be
back
in
a
moment
and
she
sped
on
around
the
corner
the
two
stood
watching
the
house
for
several
minutes
vaguely
expecting
an
explosion
of
some
sort
to
occur
but
nothing
happened
patty
was
swallowed
as
if
by
the
grave
and
the
house
gave
no
sign
they
accordingly
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
dressed
for
dinner
with
the
philosophy
which
a
life
fraught
with
alarms
and
surprises
gives
dinner
was
half
over
and
the
table
had
finished
discussing
demise
when
that
young
lady
trailed
placidly
in
smiled
on
the
expectant
faces
and
inquired
what
kind
of
soup
they
had
had
bean
soup
it
was
any
good
said
georgie
impatiently
what
happened
did
you
have
a
nice
call
no
maggie
i
do
care
for
any
soup
just
bring
me
some
steak
please
patty
in
a
pleading
chorus
what
happened
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
patty
sweetly
yes
thank
you
i
had
a
very
pleasant
call
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
bread
lucille
patty
i
think
you
obnoxious
said
georgie
tell
us
what
happened
well
began
patty
in
a
leisurely
manner
i
said
to
the
butler
millard
in
and
he
said
to
me
without
even
a
smile
am
not
sure
miss
will
you
please
step
into
the
and
i
see
i
was
going
to
tell
him
that
he
need
bother
as
i
knew
she
was
out
but
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
would
look
a
little
better
if
i
waited
and
let
him
find
out
for
himself
so
i
walked
in
and
sat
down
in
a
embroidered
chair
there
was
a
big
mirror
in
front
of
me
and
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
study
the
effect
which
i
will
acknowledge
was
a
trifle
mixed
a
trifle
georgie
assented
i
was
beginning
pursued
patty
to
feel
nervous
for
fear
some
of
the
family
might
drop
in
when
the
man
came
back
and
said
millard
will
be
down
in
a
minute
if
i
had
seen
you
at
that
moment
georgie
merriles
there
would
have
been
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
my
first
thought
was
of
flight
but
the
man
was
guarding
the
door
and
prexy
had
my
card
while
i
was
frenziedly
trying
to
think
of
a
valid
excuse
for
my
costume
the
lady
came
in
and
i
rose
and
greeted
her
graciously
one
might
almost
say
gushingly
i
talked
very
fast
and
tried
to
hypnotize
her
so
that
she
would
keep
her
eyes
on
my
face
but
it
was
no
use
i
saw
them
traveling
downward
and
pretty
soon
i
knew
by
the
amused
expression
that
they
had
arrived
at
my
shoes
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
pursued
patty
warming
to
her
subject
i
threw
myself
upon
her
mercy
and
confessed
the
whole
damning
truth
what
kind
of
is
that
she
demanded
leaning
forward
and
gazing
anxiously
after
a
passing
maid
tell
me
giving
us
raspberry
again
no
it
vanilla
go
on
patty
well
where
was
i
you
just
told
her
the
truth
oh
yes
she
said
she
always
wanted
to
meet
the
college
girls
informally
and
know
them
just
as
they
are
and
she
was
very
glad
of
this
opportunity
and
there
i
sat
looking
like
a
kaleidoscope
and
feeling
like
a
fool
and
she
taking
it
for
granted
that
i
was
being
perfectly
natural
complimentary
was
it
at
this
point
dinner
was
announced
and
she
invited
me
to
stay
quite
insisted
in
fact
to
make
up
she
said
for
the
one
i
had
missed
when
i
was
ill
in
the
infirmary
patty
looked
around
the
table
with
a
reminiscent
smile
what
did
you
say
did
you
refuse
asked
lucille
no
i
accepted
and
am
over
there
at
present
eating
de
foie
no
really
patty
what
did
you
say
well
said
patty
i
told
her
that
this
was
night
at
the
college
and
that
i
sort
of
hated
to
miss
it
but
that
would
be
mutton
night
which
i
did
mind
missing
in
the
least
so
if
she
would
just
as
leave
transfer
her
invitation
i
would
accept
for
with
pleasure
patty
exclaimed
lucille
in
a
horrified
tone
you
did
say
that
just
a
little
local
color
lucille
laughed
priscilla
but
objected
lucille
we
promised
not
to
play
local
color
any
more
have
you
not
learned
said
priscilla
that
patty
can
no
more
live
without
local
color
than
she
can
live
without
food
it
ingrained
in
her
nature
never
mind
said
patty
you
may
not
believe
me
now
but
night
when
i
all
dressed
up
in
beautiful
clothes
swapping
stories
with
prexy
and
eating
lobster
salad
while
you
are
over
here
having
mutton
maybe
you
be
sorry
xiii
a
crash
without
i
love
the
smell
of
powder
said
patty
gunpowder
or
as
patty
at
the
moment
had
her
nose
buried
in
a
box
of
she
thought
it
unnecessary
to
answer
it
brings
back
my
youth
she
pursued
the
best
times
of
my
life
have
been
mixed
up
with
powder
and
rouge
washington
birthday
nights
and
minstrel
shows
and
masquerades
and
plays
at
and
even
mother
goose
tableaux
when
i
was
a
patty
reminiscences
were
interrupted
by
georgie
who
was
anxiously
pacing
up
and
down
the
wings
it
queer
some
of
the
cast
do
come
i
told
them
to
be
here
early
so
we
could
get
them
all
made
up
and
not
have
a
rush
at
the
end
oh
there
time
enough
said
patty
comfortably
it
is
seven
yet
and
if
they
going
to
dress
in
their
rooms
it
wo
take
any
time
over
here
just
to
make
them
up
and
put
on
their
wigs
it
a
comparatively
small
cast
you
see
now
on
the
night
of
the
trig
ceremonies
when
we
had
to
make
up
three
whole
ballets
and
only
had
one
box
of
we
rushed
i
thought
i
never
live
to
see
the
curtain
go
down
do
you
remember
the
suit
of
we
made
for
bonnie
connaught
out
of
wire
it
took
and
the
store
was
terribly
dubious
about
renting
them
to
us
and
then
after
working
every
spare
second
for
three
days
over
the
thing
we
found
the
last
minute
that
we
had
left
a
big
enough
hole
for
her
to
get
into
and
oh
do
keep
still
patty
said
georgie
nervously
i
ca
remember
what
i
have
to
do
when
you
talk
all
the
time
a
manager
on
the
eve
of
producing
a
new
play
with
his
reputation
at
stake
may
be
excused
for
being
a
trifle
irritable
patty
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
descended
through
the
to
the
hall
where
she
found
cathy
fair
strolling
up
and
down
the
center
aisle
in
an
apparently
aimless
manner
hello
cathy
said
patty
what
are
you
doing
over
here
i
head
usher
and
i
wanted
to
see
if
those
foolish
sophomores
had
mixed
up
the
numbers
again
it
strikes
me
they
a
trifle
close
together
said
patty
sitting
down
and
squeezing
in
her
knees
yes
i
know
but
you
ca
get
eight
hundred
people
into
this
hall
any
other
way
when
we
once
get
them
packed
they
have
to
sit
still
that
all
what
are
you
doing
over
here
yourself
she
continued
i
did
know
you
were
on
the
committee
or
are
you
just
helping
georgie
i
in
the
cast
said
patty
oh
are
you
i
saw
the
program
but
i
forgotten
it
i
often
wondered
why
you
have
been
in
any
of
the
class
plays
fortune
and
the
faculty
are
against
it
sighed
patty
you
see
they
did
discover
my
histrionic
ability
before
examinations
freshman
year
and
after
examinations
when
i
was
asked
to
be
in
the
play
the
faculty
thought
i
could
spend
the
time
to
better
advantage
studying
greek
at
the
time
of
the
sophomore
play
i
was
on
something
else
and
serve
and
this
year
i
had
just
been
deprived
of
my
privileges
for
coming
back
late
after
christmas
but
i
thought
you
said
you
were
in
it
oh
said
patty
it
a
minor
part
and
my
name
does
appear
what
sort
of
a
part
is
it
i
a
crash
a
crash
yes
crash
without
lord
bromley
says
i
will
brave
all
for
your
sake
i
will
follow
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
at
this
point
a
crash
is
heard
without
i
said
patty
proudly
am
the
crash
i
sit
behind
a
moonlit
balcony
in
a
space
about
two
feet
square
and
drop
a
into
a
box
it
may
not
sound
like
a
very
important
part
but
it
is
the
pivot
upon
which
the
whole
plot
turns
i
hope
you
wo
be
taken
with
laughed
cathy
i
try
not
said
patty
there
comes
the
butler
and
lord
bromley
and
cynthia
i
got
to
go
and
make
them
up
why
are
you
making
people
up
if
you
are
not
on
the
committee
oh
once
during
a
period
of
mental
weakness
i
took
lessons
and
i
supposed
to
know
how
if
you
get
any
flowers
i
send
them
in
by
an
usher
do
said
patty
i
sure
to
get
a
lot
behind
the
scenes
all
was
joyful
confusion
georgie
in
a
short
skirt
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
a
in
her
hand
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
directing
the
and
distracted
committee
patty
in
the
was
presiding
over
the
cast
with
a
hare
foot
in
one
hand
and
the
other
daubed
with
red
and
blue
oh
patty
remonstrated
cynthia
with
a
horrified
glance
in
the
mirror
i
look
more
like
a
soubrette
than
a
heroine
that
the
way
you
ought
to
look
returned
patty
here
hold
still
till
i
put
another
dab
on
your
chin
cynthia
appealed
to
the
faithful
lord
bromley
who
was
sitting
in
the
background
politely
letting
the
ladies
go
first
look
bonnie
you
think
i
too
red
i
know
it
all
come
off
when
you
kiss
me
if
it
comes
off
as
easily
as
that
you
be
more
fortunate
than
most
of
the
people
i
make
up
and
patty
smiled
knowingly
as
she
remembered
how
priscilla
had
soaked
half
the
night
on
the
occasion
of
a
previous
play
and
then
had
appeared
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
with
lowering
eyebrows
and
a
hectic
flush
on
each
cheek
you
must
remember
that
take
a
lot
of
color
she
explained
condescendingly
look
ghastly
if
i
let
you
go
the
way
you
wanted
to
at
first
next
no
said
patty
as
the
butler
presented
himself
you
do
come
till
the
second
act
i
take
the
irate
parent
first
the
irate
parent
was
dragged
from
a
corner
where
he
had
been
anxiously
mumbling
over
his
lines
what
the
matter
asked
patty
as
she
began
daubing
in
wrinkles
with
a
liberal
hand
are
you
afraid
said
the
parent
i
not
afraid
only
i
afraid
that
i
will
be
afraid
you
just
better
change
your
mind
then
said
patty
sternly
we
are
going
to
allow
any
patty
you
can
manage
georgie
merriles
make
her
let
me
go
on
without
any
wig
cried
cynthia
returning
and
holding
up
to
view
a
mass
of
yellow
curls
of
a
shade
that
was
never
produced
in
the
course
of
nature
patty
looked
at
the
wig
critically
it
is
perhaps
a
trifle
golden
for
the
part
golden
said
cynthia
it
positively
wait
till
you
see
how
it
lights
up
he
calls
me
his
beauty
and
i
sure
no
one
with
dark
eyes
or
any
other
kind
of
eyes
would
have
hair
like
that
my
own
looks
a
great
deal
better
why
do
you
wear
your
own
then
wrinkle
up
your
forehead
parent
and
let
me
see
which
way
they
run
georgie
paid
two
dollars
for
renting
it
and
she
bound
to
get
the
money
worth
of
wear
out
of
it
even
if
she
makes
me
look
like
a
fright
and
spoils
the
play
nonsense
said
patty
pushing
away
the
parent
and
giving
her
undivided
attention
to
the
question
your
own
hair
does
look
better
just
mislay
the
wig
and
keep
out
of
georgie
way
till
the
curtain
goes
up
the
audience
are
beginning
to
come
she
announced
to
the
room
in
general
and
you
got
to
keep
still
back
there
you
making
an
awful
racket
and
they
can
hear
you
all
over
the
house
here
what
are
you
making
such
a
noise
for
she
demanded
of
lord
bromley
who
came
clumping
up
with
footfalls
which
reverberated
through
the
flies
i
ca
help
it
he
said
crossly
look
at
these
boots
they
so
big
that
i
can
step
out
of
them
without
unlacing
them
it
not
my
fault
i
have
anything
to
do
with
the
costumes
i
know
it
but
what
can
i
do
never
mind
said
patty
soothingly
they
do
look
so
awfully
bad
you
have
to
try
and
walk
without
raising
your
feet
she
went
out
on
the
stage
where
georgie
was
giving
her
last
directions
to
the
the
minute
the
curtain
goes
down
on
the
first
act
change
this
forest
to
the
scene
and
do
make
any
noise
hammering
if
you
have
to
hammer
do
it
while
the
playing
how
does
it
look
she
asked
anxiously
turning
to
patty
beautiful
said
patty
i
scarcely
recognize
it
the
forest
scene
had
served
in
every
outdoor
capacity
for
the
last
four
years
and
it
was
usually
hailed
with
a
groan
on
the
part
of
the
audience
i
was
just
coming
in
to
see
if
the
cast
were
ready
said
georgie
they
all
made
up
and
are
sitting
in
the
getting
what
shall
i
do
now
let
me
see
said
georgie
consulting
her
book
one
of
the
committee
is
to
prompt
one
is
to
stay
with
the
men
and
see
that
they
manage
the
curtain
and
the
lights
in
the
right
places
one
is
to
give
the
cues
and
two
are
to
help
change
costumes
cynthia
has
to
change
from
a
to
a
in
four
minutes
i
think
you
better
help
her
too
anything
you
please
said
patty
obligingly
i
stand
on
a
stool
with
the
in
the
air
ready
to
drop
it
over
her
head
the
moment
she
appears
like
a
harness
on
a
is
everything
out
here
done
what
time
is
it
yes
everything
done
and
it
five
minutes
of
eight
we
can
begin
as
soon
as
the
audience
is
ready
they
peered
through
the
folds
of
the
heavy
velvet
curtain
at
the
sea
of
faces
in
front
eight
hundred
girls
in
light
were
talking
and
laughing
and
singing
snatches
of
song
would
start
up
in
one
corner
and
sweep
gaily
over
the
house
and
sometimes
two
would
meet
and
clash
in
the
center
to
the
horror
of
those
who
preferred
harmony
to
volume
here
come
the
old
girls
said
patty
as
a
procession
of
some
fifty
filed
into
reserved
seats
near
the
front
there
are
loads
of
last
year
class
back
what
are
the
juniors
doing
look
i
believe
they
are
going
to
serenade
them
the
juniors
rose
in
a
body
and
turning
to
their
departed
sister
class
sang
a
song
notable
for
its
sentiment
rather
than
its
meter
i
do
hope
it
will
be
a
success
sighed
georgie
if
it
does
come
up
to
last
year
senior
play
i
shall
oh
it
will
said
patty
reassuringly
anything
would
be
better
than
that
now
the
glee
club
going
to
sing
two
songs
said
georgie
thank
heaven
they
new
she
added
fervently
and
the
orchestra
plays
an
overture
and
then
the
curtain
goes
up
run
and
tell
them
to
come
out
here
ready
for
the
first
act
lord
bromley
was
standing
in
the
wings
disgustedly
viewing
the
see
here
patty
he
called
as
she
hurried
past
look
at
this
stuff
georgie
merriles
has
palmed
off
on
us
for
wine
you
expect
me
to
drink
any
such
dope
as
patty
paused
for
an
instant
what
the
matter
with
it
she
inquired
pouring
out
some
in
a
glass
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
matter
it
made
of
currant
jelly
and
water
with
cold
tea
mixed
in
i
made
it
myself
said
patty
with
some
dignity
it
a
beautiful
color
but
i
have
to
drain
my
glass
at
a
draught
expostulated
the
outraged
lord
i
sure
there
nothing
in
currant
jelly
or
tea
to
hurt
you
you
can
be
thankful
it
is
poisonous
and
patty
hurried
on
the
glee
club
sang
the
two
new
songs
punctuated
with
the
appreciative
applause
of
a
audience
and
the
orchestra
commenced
the
overture
everybody
clear
the
stage
said
georgie
in
a
low
tone
and
you
keep
your
eyes
on
the
book
she
added
sternly
to
the
prompter
you
lost
your
place
twice
at
the
dress
rehearsal
the
overture
died
down
a
bell
tinkled
and
the
curtain
parted
in
the
middle
discovering
cynthia
sitting
on
a
in
the
castle
park
originally
the
forest
of
arden
as
the
curtain
fell
at
the
end
of
the
act
and
the
applause
gave
way
to
an
excited
buzz
in
the
audience
patty
hugged
georgie
gleefully
fifty
times
better
than
last
year
heaven
send
theo
granby
is
out
there
piously
ejaculated
georgie
theo
granby
had
been
the
chairman
of
last
year
senior
play
the
curtain
had
risen
on
the
fourth
act
and
patty
squeezed
herself
into
the
somewhat
close
quarters
behind
the
balcony
there
was
fortunately
or
rather
unfortunately
a
window
in
the
rear
of
the
building
at
this
point
and
patty
opened
it
and
perched
herself
at
one
end
of
the
sill
with
the
ready
for
use
at
the
other
end
the
crash
was
not
due
for
some
time
and
patty
having
lately
elected
astronomy
whiled
away
the
interval
by
examining
the
stars
on
the
stage
matters
were
approaching
a
climax
lord
bromley
was
making
an
excellent
lover
as
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
audience
was
taking
him
seriously
instead
of
laughing
through
the
love
scenes
as
usual
cynthia
he
implored
say
that
you
will
be
mine
and
i
will
brave
all
for
your
sake
i
will
follow
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
gazed
tenderly
into
her
eyes
and
waited
for
the
crash
a
silence
as
of
the
tomb
prevailed
and
he
continued
to
gaze
tenderly
while
a
grin
rapidly
spread
over
the
audience
hang
patty
he
murmured
savagely
might
have
known
she
do
something
like
what
was
that
did
you
hear
a
noise
he
asked
aloud
no
said
cynthia
truthfully
i
did
not
hear
anything
pretend
you
did
he
whispered
and
they
continued
to
improvise
after
some
five
minutes
of
hopeless
floundering
the
prompter
got
them
back
on
the
track
again
and
the
act
proceeded
with
the
audience
happily
unaware
that
anything
was
missing
ten
minutes
later
lord
bromley
was
declaiming
cynthia
let
us
flee
this
place
its
dark
rooms
haunt
me
its
silence
oppresses
me
and
the
crash
came
for
the
first
moment
the
audience
was
too
startled
to
notice
that
the
actors
were
also
taken
by
surprise
then
lord
bromley
who
was
getting
used
to
emergencies
pulled
himself
together
and
ejaculated
hark
what
was
that
sound
i
think
it
was
a
crash
said
cynthia
he
grasped
her
hand
and
ran
back
toward
the
balcony
give
us
our
lines
he
said
to
the
prompter
as
he
went
past
the
prompter
had
dropped
the
book
and
could
find
the
place
make
them
up
came
in
a
piercing
whisper
from
behind
the
balcony
a
silence
ensued
while
the
two
dashed
back
and
forth
looking
excitedly
up
and
down
the
stage
then
the
despairing
lord
bromley
stretched
out
his
arms
in
a
gesture
of
supplication
cynthia
he
burst
out
in
tones
of
realistic
longing
i
can
not
bear
this
horrible
suspense
let
us
flee
and
they
fled
fully
three
pages
too
early
forgetting
to
leave
the
letter
which
should
have
apprised
the
irate
parent
of
the
circumstance
georgie
was
tramping
up
and
down
the
wings
wringing
her
hands
and
lamenting
the
day
that
ever
patty
had
been
born
hurry
up
that
parent
before
they
stop
clapping
said
lord
bromley
and
they
never
know
the
difference
the
poor
old
man
with
his
wig
over
one
ear
was
unceremoniously
hustled
on
to
the
stage
where
he
raved
up
and
down
and
swore
never
to
forgive
his
ungrateful
daughter
in
so
realistic
a
manner
that
the
audience
forgot
to
wonder
how
he
found
it
out
in
due
time
the
runaways
returned
from
the
notary
overcame
the
old
man
harshness
received
the
parental
blessing
and
the
curtain
fell
on
a
scene
of
domestic
felicity
that
delighted
the
freshmen
in
the
gallery
patty
crawled
out
from
under
the
balcony
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
georgie
feet
lord
bromley
raised
her
up
never
mind
patty
the
audience
know
the
difference
and
anyway
it
was
all
for
the
best
my
mustache
would
have
stayed
on
more
than
two
minutes
longer
they
could
hear
some
one
shouting
in
the
front
what
the
matter
with
georgie
merriles
and
a
hundred
voices
replied
she
all
right
who
all
right
what
the
matter
with
the
cast
they
all
right
the
burst
open
and
a
crowd
of
congratulatory
friends
burst
in
and
gathered
around
the
disheveled
actors
and
committee
it
the
best
senior
play
since
we
been
in
college
the
freshmen
are
simply
crazy
over
it
lord
bromley
your
room
will
be
full
of
flowers
for
a
month
patty
called
the
head
usher
over
the
heads
of
the
others
let
me
congratulate
you
i
was
in
the
very
back
of
the
room
and
never
heard
a
thing
but
your
crash
it
sounded
patty
demanded
georgie
what
in
the
world
were
you
doing
i
was
counting
the
stars
said
the
contrite
patty
and
then
i
remembered
too
late
and
i
turned
around
suddenly
and
it
fell
off
i
am
terribly
sorry
never
mind
laughed
georgie
since
it
turned
out
well
i
forgive
you
all
the
cast
and
committee
she
said
raising
her
voice
come
up
to
my
room
for
food
i
sorry
i
ca
invite
you
all
she
added
to
the
girls
crowded
in
the
doorway
but
i
live
in
a
single
xiv
the
mystery
of
the
shadowed
sophomore
oh
i
say
bonnie
bonnie
connaught
priscilla
wait
a
minute
called
a
girl
from
across
the
links
as
the
two
were
strolling
homeward
one
afternoon
dragging
their
behind
them
they
turned
and
waited
while
bonnie
sophomore
cousin
mildred
connaught
dashed
up
she
grasped
them
excitedly
and
at
the
same
time
glanced
over
her
shoulder
with
the
air
of
a
criminal
who
is
being
tracked
i
want
to
tell
you
something
she
panted
come
in
here
where
no
one
will
see
us
and
she
dived
into
a
clump
of
growing
by
the
path
priscilla
and
bonnie
followed
more
leisurely
and
dropped
down
on
the
soft
needles
with
an
air
of
amused
tolerance
well
mildred
what
the
matter
bonnie
inquired
mildly
the
sophomore
lowered
her
voice
to
an
impressive
whisper
although
there
was
not
a
person
within
a
hundred
yards
i
am
being
she
said
solemnly
followed
exclaimed
bonnie
in
amazement
are
you
crazy
child
you
act
like
a
boy
who
been
reading
dime
novels
listen
girls
you
must
tell
a
soul
because
it
a
great
secret
we
going
to
plant
the
class
tree
and
i
am
chairman
of
the
ceremonies
everything
is
ready
the
costumes
are
finished
and
the
plans
all
arranged
so
that
the
class
can
get
out
to
the
place
without
being
seen
the
freshmen
have
a
suspicion
that
it
going
to
be
but
they
have
found
out
that
i
chairman
of
the
committee
and
if
you
please
mildred
eyes
grew
wide
with
excitement
they
been
me
for
a
week
they
have
of
girls
appointed
to
watch
me
and
i
ca
stir
without
a
freshman
tagging
along
behind
when
i
went
down
to
order
the
there
was
one
right
at
my
elbow
and
i
had
to
pretend
that
i
come
for
i
have
simply
had
to
let
the
rest
of
the
committee
do
all
of
the
work
because
i
was
so
afraid
the
freshmen
would
find
out
the
time
it
was
funny
at
first
but
i
am
getting
nervous
it
horrible
to
think
that
you
being
watched
all
the
time
i
feel
as
if
i
committed
a
murder
and
keep
looking
over
my
shoulder
like
like
macbeth
it
bonnie
shuddered
i
thrilled
to
the
bone
to
think
of
the
peril
a
member
of
my
family
is
braving
for
the
sake
of
her
class
you
need
laugh
said
mildred
it
a
serious
matter
if
those
freshmen
come
to
our
tree
ceremonies
we
never
hear
the
last
of
it
but
they
are
not
going
to
come
she
added
with
a
meaning
smile
they
have
another
engagement
we
chose
because
there
a
lecture
before
the
archæological
society
by
some
alumna
person
who
been
digging
up
remains
in
rome
the
freshmen
have
been
told
to
go
and
hear
her
on
account
of
their
latin
imagine
their
feelings
when
they
are
cooped
up
in
the
auditorium
trying
to
look
intelligent
about
the
roman
forum
and
listening
to
our
yells
outside
priscilla
and
bonnie
smiled
appreciatively
it
was
not
so
long
after
all
since
they
themselves
were
sophomores
and
they
recalled
their
own
tree
ceremonies
when
the
freshmen
had
been
cooped
up
but
the
trouble
is
pursued
mildred
that
it
more
important
for
me
to
get
there
than
any
one
else
because
i
have
to
dig
the
hole
peters
is
really
going
to
dig
it
you
know
i
just
take
out
the
first
shovelful
but
i
ca
get
there
on
account
of
that
beastly
scout
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
acting
suspicious
she
run
and
warn
the
class
i
see
said
bonnie
but
what
have
priscilla
and
i
to
do
with
it
well
said
mildred
tentatively
you
both
pretty
big
you
know
and
you
our
sister
class
and
you
ought
to
help
us
certainly
acquiesced
bonnie
but
in
just
what
way
well
my
idea
was
this
if
you
would
just
stroll
down
by
the
lake
after
chapel
and
loiter
sort
of
inconspicuously
among
the
trees
you
know
i
would
come
that
way
a
little
later
and
then
when
the
detective
person
came
along
after
me
you
could
just
nab
her
and
chuck
her
in
the
lake
asked
bonnie
no
of
course
not
do
use
any
force
just
politely
detain
her
till
you
hear
us
yelling
take
her
for
a
walk
she
feel
honored
bonnie
laughed
the
program
struck
her
as
entertaining
i
do
see
anything
very
immoral
in
delaying
a
freshman
who
is
going
where
she
has
no
business
to
go
what
do
you
say
pris
it
not
exactly
a
excursion
acknowledged
priscilla
but
i
do
see
why
it
is
as
legitimate
for
us
to
play
detective
as
for
them
by
all
means
said
bonnie
behold
sherlock
holmes
and
his
friend
watson
about
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
shadowed
sophomore
you
saved
my
life
said
mildred
feelingly
do
forget
right
after
chapel
by
the
lake
she
peered
warily
out
through
the
branches
i
got
to
get
the
keys
to
the
gymnasium
so
the
refreshments
can
be
put
in
during
chapel
do
you
see
anybody
lurking
about
i
guess
i
can
get
off
without
being
seen
and
she
sped
away
like
a
hunted
animal
bonnie
looked
after
her
and
laughed
is
a
great
time
but
somewhat
fussy
she
quoted
and
the
two
took
their
homeward
way
they
found
patty
who
was
experiencing
a
periodical
fit
of
studying
immersed
in
dictionaries
and
grammars
it
was
under
protest
that
she
allowed
herself
to
be
interrupted
long
enough
to
hear
the
story
of
their
proposed
adventure
you
babies
she
exclaimed
have
you
grown
up
yet
do
you
think
it
a
little
undignified
for
seniors
one
might
almost
say
alumnæ
to
be
kidnapping
freshmen
we
not
kidnapping
freshmen
bonnie
remonstrated
we
teaching
them
manners
it
my
duty
to
protect
my
little
cousin
you
can
come
with
us
and
help
detect
said
priscilla
generously
thank
you
said
patty
loftily
i
have
time
to
play
with
you
children
cathy
fair
and
i
are
going
to
do
old
english
that
evening
as
patty
keyed
to
the
point
of
grappling
with
and
throwing
whole
pages
of
beowulf
stood
outside
the
chapel
door
waiting
for
cathy
to
appear
the
professor
of
latin
came
out
with
a
stranger
oh
miss
wyatt
she
exclaimed
in
a
relieved
tone
pouncing
upon
patty
i
wish
to
present
you
to
miss
henderson
one
of
our
alumnæ
who
is
to
lecture
before
the
archæological
society
she
has
not
been
back
for
several
years
and
wishes
to
see
the
new
buildings
have
you
time
to
show
her
around
the
campus
a
little
before
the
lecture
begins
patty
bowed
and
murmured
that
she
would
be
most
happy
and
cast
an
agonized
glance
back
at
cathy
as
she
led
the
lecturer
off
as
they
strolled
about
patty
poured
out
all
the
statistics
she
knew
about
the
various
buildings
and
miss
henderson
received
them
with
exclamations
of
delighted
surprise
she
was
rather
young
and
gushing
for
a
and
an
archæologist
patty
decided
and
she
wondered
desperately
how
she
could
dispose
of
her
and
get
back
to
beowulf
and
cathy
they
rounded
the
top
of
a
little
hill
and
miss
henderson
exclaimed
delightedly
there
is
the
lake
just
as
it
used
to
be
patty
stifled
a
desire
to
remark
that
lakes
had
a
habit
of
staying
where
they
used
to
be
and
asked
politely
if
miss
henderson
would
like
to
take
a
row
miss
henderson
thought
that
it
would
be
pleasant
but
she
had
forgotten
her
watch
and
was
afraid
there
would
not
be
time
patty
glanced
about
vaguely
for
some
further
object
of
interest
and
spied
mildred
connaught
sauntering
toward
the
lake
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
sherlock
holmes
adventure
and
she
suddenly
had
an
inspiration
be
it
said
to
her
credit
that
she
hesitated
a
moment
but
the
lecturer
next
remark
led
to
her
own
undoing
she
was
murmuring
something
about
feeling
like
a
stranger
and
wishing
that
she
might
know
the
students
informally
and
see
a
little
of
the
real
college
life
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
gratify
her
when
i
can
do
it
so
easily
patty
told
herself
and
she
added
out
loud
i
am
sure
we
have
time
for
a
little
row
miss
henderson
you
walk
on
and
i
will
run
back
and
get
my
watch
it
wo
take
a
minute
i
would
have
you
do
that
it
is
too
much
trouble
remonstrated
miss
henderson
it
no
trouble
whatever
patty
protested
kindly
i
can
take
a
cross
cut
and
meet
you
at
the
little
where
the
boats
are
moored
it
straight
down
this
path
you
ca
miss
it
just
follow
that
girl
over
there
and
she
darted
away
the
lecturer
gazed
dubiously
after
her
a
moment
and
then
started
on
after
the
girl
who
cast
a
look
over
her
shoulder
and
quickened
her
pace
it
was
growing
quite
dusky
under
the
trees
and
the
lecturer
hurried
on
trying
to
keep
the
girl
in
sight
but
she
unexpectedly
turned
a
corner
and
disappeared
and
at
the
same
moment
two
strange
girls
suddenly
dropped
into
the
path
apparently
from
the
good
evening
they
said
pleasantly
are
you
taking
a
walk
the
lecturer
started
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
but
as
soon
as
she
could
regain
her
composure
she
replied
politely
that
she
was
strolling
about
and
looking
at
the
campus
perhaps
you
would
like
to
stroll
with
us
they
inquired
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
but
i
have
an
engagement
to
row
with
one
of
the
students
priscilla
and
bonnie
exchanged
delighted
glances
they
had
evidently
caught
a
resourceful
young
person
oh
no
it
too
late
for
a
row
you
might
get
malaria
priscilla
remonstrated
come
and
sit
on
the
fence
with
us
and
admire
the
stars
it
a
lovely
night
the
lecturer
cast
an
alarmed
glance
toward
the
fence
which
appeared
to
have
an
unusually
narrow
top
rail
you
are
very
kind
she
stammered
but
i
really
ca
stop
the
girl
will
be
waiting
who
is
the
girl
they
inquired
i
do
know
that
i
remember
her
name
mildred
connaught
bonnie
suggested
no
i
do
think
that
is
it
but
i
really
ca
say
i
have
only
just
met
her
miss
henderson
was
growing
more
and
more
puzzled
in
her
day
the
students
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
strangers
with
invitations
to
go
walking
and
sit
on
fences
ah
stay
with
us
bonnie
begged
laying
a
hand
on
her
arm
lonely
and
want
some
one
to
talk
to
we
tell
you
a
secret
if
you
do
i
am
sorry
miss
henderson
murmured
confusedly
but
we
tell
you
the
secret
anyway
said
bonnie
generously
and
sure
you
be
interested
the
sophomores
are
going
to
have
their
tree
ceremonies
and
you
know
priscilla
broke
in
that
the
freshmen
really
ought
to
attend
them
too
it
does
matter
if
they
are
invited
but
where
do
you
suppose
the
freshmen
are
they
attending
a
foolish
little
lecture
on
the
roman
forum
and
though
we
do
wish
to
seem
insistent
bonnie
added
we
should
really
like
to
have
your
company
until
the
lecture
is
over
until
the
lecture
is
over
but
i
am
the
lecturer
gasped
miss
henderson
bonnie
grinned
delightedly
i
am
happy
to
meet
you
she
said
with
a
bow
and
perhaps
you
do
not
recognize
us
i
am
sherlock
holmes
and
this
is
my
friend
dr
watson
watson
bowed
and
remarked
that
it
was
an
unexpected
pleasure
he
had
often
heard
of
the
famous
lecturer
but
had
never
hoped
to
meet
her
miss
henderson
who
was
not
very
conversant
with
recent
literature
looked
more
dazed
than
ever
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
there
was
an
insane
asylum
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
thought
was
not
reassuring
we
not
handcuff
you
said
bonnie
magnanimously
if
you
come
with
us
quietly
the
lecturer
in
spite
of
fervid
protestations
that
she
was
a
lecturer
presently
found
herself
sitting
on
the
fence
with
a
girl
on
either
side
grasping
an
elbow
a
light
was
beginning
to
break
upon
her
together
with
a
poignant
realization
of
the
fact
that
she
was
seeing
more
of
the
real
college
life
than
she
cared
for
what
time
is
it
she
asked
anxiously
ten
minutes
past
eight
by
my
watch
but
i
think
it
a
little
slow
said
bonnie
i
am
afraid
you
going
to
be
late
for
your
lecture
said
priscilla
it
seems
a
pity
to
waste
it
suppose
you
tell
it
to
us
instead
yes
do
urged
bonnie
i
just
dote
on
the
roman
forum
the
lecturer
preserved
a
dignified
silence
which
was
broken
only
by
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
and
the
occasional
remarks
of
the
two
detectives
she
had
relinquished
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
the
archæological
society
and
had
philosophically
resigned
herself
to
the
prospect
of
sitting
on
the
fence
all
night
when
suddenly
there
burst
out
from
across
the
campus
a
song
of
victory
mingled
with
cheers
and
inarticulate
yells
at
the
first
sound
bonnie
and
priscilla
tumbled
down
from
the
fence
bringing
the
lecturer
with
them
and
each
grasping
her
by
a
hand
they
started
to
run
come
on
and
see
the
fun
they
laughed
perfectly
welcome
it
no
secret
any
more
and
in
spite
of
breathless
protestations
that
she
much
preferred
to
walk
miss
henderson
found
herself
dashing
across
the
campus
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
heads
suddenly
appeared
in
the
dormitory
windows
doors
banged
and
girls
came
running
from
every
quarter
with
excited
exclamations
the
sophomores
are
having
their
tree
ceremonies
where
are
the
freshmen
why
did
they
get
there
a
crowd
quickly
gathered
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
watched
the
scene
with
laughing
interest
a
wide
circle
of
colored
lanterns
swayed
in
the
breeze
and
within
a
line
of
figures
wound
and
unwound
about
a
tiny
tree
to
the
music
of
a
solemn
chant
is
it
pretty
are
you
glad
we
brought
you
bonnie
demanded
as
they
pushed
through
the
crowd
the
lecturer
did
not
answer
for
she
caught
sight
of
the
latin
professor
hurrying
toward
them
miss
henderson
i
was
afraid
you
were
lost
it
is
nearly
eight
the
audience
has
been
waiting
and
we
have
been
filling
in
the
time
with
reports
for
a
moment
the
lecturer
was
silent
being
occupied
with
an
amused
scrutiny
of
the
faces
of
her
captors
and
then
she
rose
to
the
occasion
like
a
lady
and
a
scholar
and
delivered
a
masterly
apology
with
never
a
reference
to
her
sojourn
on
the
fence
bonnie
and
priscilla
stared
at
each
other
without
a
word
and
as
miss
henderson
was
led
away
to
the
remnants
of
her
audience
patty
suddenly
appeared
good
evening
sherlock
holmes
and
watson
did
you
solve
your
mystery
she
asked
sweetly
priscilla
turned
her
to
the
light
and
scrutinized
her
face
patty
smiled
back
with
innocent
eyes
priscilla
knew
the
expression
and
she
shook
her
you
little
wretch
she
exclaimed
patty
squirmed
out
from
under
her
grasp
if
you
remember
she
murmured
i
once
said
that
the
lick
observatory
was
in
dublin
ireland
it
was
a
very
funny
mistake
of
course
but
i
know
of
others
that
are
funnier
what
do
you
mean
bonnie
demanded
i
mean
said
patty
that
i
wish
you
never
to
mention
the
lick
observatory
again
xv
patty
and
the
bishop
the
rang
for
sunday
morning
service
and
patty
laid
down
her
book
with
a
sigh
and
went
and
stood
by
the
open
window
the
outside
world
was
a
shimmering
green
and
yellow
the
trees
showed
a
feathery
fringe
against
the
sky
and
the
breeze
was
redolent
of
violets
and
fresh
earth
patty
called
priscilla
from
her
bedroom
you
have
to
hurry
if
you
want
me
to
fasten
your
dress
i
have
to
go
to
choir
rehearsal
patty
turned
back
with
another
sigh
and
began
slowly
unhooking
her
collar
then
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
and
stared
absently
out
of
the
window
a
vigorous
banging
of
bureau
drawers
in
priscilla
room
was
presently
followed
by
priscilla
herself
in
the
doorway
she
surveyed
her
suspiciously
why
are
you
dressing
she
demanded
i
fasten
my
own
dress
you
need
wait
said
patty
without
removing
her
eyes
from
the
window
bishop
copeley
going
to
preach
and
he
such
an
old
dear
you
must
be
late
patty
elevated
her
chin
a
trifle
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
are
you
going
to
chapel
patty
brought
her
gaze
back
from
the
window
and
looked
up
at
priscilla
beseechingly
it
such
a
lovely
day
she
pleaded
and
i
so
much
rather
spend
the
time
out
of
doors
i
sure
it
would
be
a
lot
better
for
my
spiritual
welfare
it
not
a
question
of
spiritual
welfare
it
a
question
of
cuts
you
already
twice
what
excuse
do
you
intend
to
give
when
the
committee
asks
for
an
explanation
unto
the
day
laughed
patty
when
the
time
comes
think
of
a
beautiful
new
excuse
that
will
charm
the
committee
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
evade
the
rules
the
way
you
do
where
is
the
fun
of
living
if
you
are
going
to
make
yourself
a
slave
to
all
sorts
of
petty
rules
asked
patty
wearily
i
do
know
why
you
have
a
right
to
live
outside
of
rules
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
patty
shrugged
i
take
the
right
and
every
one
else
can
do
the
same
every
one
else
ca
returned
priscilla
hotly
for
there
be
any
law
left
in
college
if
they
did
i
should
a
good
deal
rather
play
out
of
doors
myself
than
go
to
chapel
but
i
used
up
all
my
cuts
and
i
ca
you
could
either
if
you
had
a
shred
of
proper
feeling
left
the
only
way
you
can
get
out
of
it
is
by
lying
priscilla
dear
patty
murmured
people
in
polite
society
do
put
things
quite
so
baldly
if
you
would
be
respected
in
the
best
circles
you
must
practise
the
art
of
equivocation
priscilla
frowned
impatiently
are
you
coming
or
are
you
not
she
demanded
i
am
not
priscilla
closed
the
door
not
quite
as
softly
as
a
door
should
be
closed
and
patty
was
left
alone
she
sat
thinking
a
few
minutes
with
slightly
flushed
cheeks
and
then
as
the
chapel
bell
rang
she
shook
herself
and
laughed
even
had
she
wished
to
go
it
was
too
late
now
and
all
feeling
of
responsibility
vanished
as
soon
as
the
decorous
swish
of
sunday
silks
had
ceased
in
the
corridor
outside
she
caught
up
a
book
and
a
cushion
and
creeping
down
by
the
side
stairs
set
gaily
out
across
the
sunlit
lawn
with
the
deliciously
guilty
thrill
of
a
truant
little
boy
who
has
run
away
from
school
from
the
open
windows
of
the
chapel
she
could
hear
the
college
chanting
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
and
incline
our
hearts
to
keep
this
law
she
laughed
happily
to
herself
she
was
not
keeping
laws
they
might
stay
in
there
in
the
gloom
if
they
wanted
to
with
their
commandments
and
their
litanies
she
was
worshiping
under
the
blue
sky
to
the
jubilant
chanting
of
the
birds
she
was
the
only
person
alive
and
out
that
morning
and
the
spring
was
in
her
blood
and
she
felt
as
though
she
owned
the
world
the
campus
had
never
seemed
so
radiant
she
paused
on
the
little
rustic
bridge
to
watch
the
excited
swirling
of
the
brook
and
she
nearly
lost
her
balance
while
trying
to
launch
a
tiny
boat
made
of
a
piece
of
bark
she
dropped
pebbles
into
the
pool
in
order
to
watch
the
startled
frogs
splash
back
into
the
water
and
she
threw
her
cushion
at
a
squirrel
and
laughed
aloud
at
its
angry
chattering
she
raced
up
the
side
of
pine
bluff
and
dropped
down
panting
on
the
fragrant
needles
in
the
shadow
of
a
tall
pine
below
her
the
buildings
of
the
college
lay
clustered
among
the
trees
and
in
the
sunday
quiet
with
the
sunlight
shining
on
the
towers
it
looked
like
some
medieval
village
sleeping
in
the
valley
patty
gazed
down
dreamily
with
eyes
and
imagined
that
presently
a
band
of
troubadours
and
ladies
would
come
riding
out
on
mules
but
the
sight
of
peters
strolling
to
the
gateway
in
his
sunday
clothes
spoiled
the
illusion
and
she
turned
to
her
book
with
a
smile
presently
she
closed
it
however
this
was
not
the
time
for
reading
one
could
read
in
winter
and
when
it
rained
and
even
in
the
college
library
with
every
one
else
turning
pages
but
out
here
in
the
open
with
the
real
things
of
life
happening
all
about
it
was
a
waste
of
opportunity
her
eyes
wandered
back
to
the
campus
again
and
she
suddenly
grew
sober
as
the
thought
swept
over
her
that
in
a
few
weeks
more
it
would
be
hers
no
longer
this
happy
irresponsible
community
life
which
had
come
to
be
the
only
natural
way
of
living
was
suddenly
at
an
end
she
remembered
the
first
day
of
being
a
freshman
when
everything
but
herself
had
looked
so
big
and
she
had
thought
desperately
four
years
of
this
it
had
seemed
like
an
eternity
and
now
that
it
was
over
it
seemed
like
a
minute
she
wanted
to
clutch
the
present
and
hold
it
fast
it
was
a
terrible
thing
this
growing
old
and
there
were
the
girls
she
would
have
to
say
with
no
opening
day
in
the
fall
and
priscilla
lived
in
california
and
georgie
in
south
dakota
and
bonnie
in
kentucky
and
she
in
new
england
and
they
were
the
only
people
in
the
world
she
particularly
cared
to
talk
to
she
would
have
to
get
acquainted
with
her
mother
friends
with
chronically
people
who
talked
about
husbands
and
children
and
servants
and
there
would
be
men
she
had
never
had
time
to
know
many
men
but
some
day
she
would
probably
be
marrying
one
of
them
and
then
all
be
over
and
before
she
had
time
to
think
she
would
be
an
old
lady
telling
her
grandchildren
stories
about
when
she
was
a
girl
illustration
i
have
just
run
away
from
you
bishop
copeley
patty
gazed
mournfully
down
on
the
campus
almost
on
the
verge
of
tears
over
her
lost
youth
when
a
step
suddenly
sounded
on
the
gravel
path
and
she
looked
up
with
a
startled
glance
to
see
a
churchly
figure
rounding
the
hill
involuntarily
she
prepared
for
flight
but
the
bishop
had
spied
her
together
with
a
little
rustic
seat
under
a
tree
and
he
smiled
upon
the
one
and
dropped
down
upon
the
other
with
a
sigh
of
content
a
beautiful
view
he
gasped
but
a
very
steep
hill
it
is
steep
patty
agreed
politely
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
escape
she
resumed
her
seat
and
added
with
a
laugh
i
have
just
run
away
from
you
bishop
copeley
and
here
you
come
following
along
behind
like
an
accusing
conscience
the
bishop
chuckled
i
run
away
myself
he
returned
i
knew
i
should
have
to
be
introduced
to
a
hundred
or
so
of
you
after
service
so
i
just
slipped
out
the
back
way
for
a
quiet
stroll
patty
eyed
him
appreciatively
with
a
new
sense
of
i
should
like
to
have
run
away
from
church
as
well
he
confessed
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
out
of
doors
is
the
best
church
on
a
day
like
this
that
what
i
think
said
patty
cordially
but
i
had
no
idea
that
bishops
were
so
sensible
they
chatted
along
in
a
friendly
manner
on
various
subjects
and
exchanged
lay
opinions
on
the
college
and
the
clergy
it
a
funny
thing
about
this
place
said
patty
ruminatingly
that
though
we
have
a
different
preacher
every
sunday
we
always
have
the
same
sermon
the
same
sermon
inquired
the
bishop
somewhat
aghast
practically
the
same
said
patty
i
heard
it
for
four
years
and
i
think
i
could
almost
preach
it
myself
they
all
seem
to
think
you
know
that
because
we
come
to
college
we
must
be
monsters
of
reason
and
they
urge
us
to
remember
that
reason
and
science
are
not
the
only
things
that
count
in
the
world
that
feeling
is
after
all
the
main
factor
and
they
quote
a
little
poem
about
the
flower
being
beautiful
i
know
not
why
that
was
what
yours
was
about
she
asked
anxiously
not
this
time
said
the
bishop
i
preached
an
old
one
it
the
best
way
said
patty
we
human
beings
if
we
do
come
to
college
i
remember
once
we
had
a
man
from
yale
or
harvard
or
some
such
place
and
he
preached
an
old
sermon
he
urged
us
to
become
more
manly
it
was
very
refreshing
the
bishop
smiled
do
you
run
away
from
church
very
often
he
inquired
mildly
no
i
do
have
a
chance
when
i
room
with
priscilla
but
obligatory
chapel
makes
you
want
to
run
away
she
added
it
not
the
chapel
i
object
to
it
the
obligatoriness
but
you
have
a
system
of
er
cuts
he
suggested
three
a
month
said
patty
sadly
evening
chapel
counts
as
one
but
sunday
morning
church
as
two
so
you
expended
two
cuts
to
escape
me
he
asked
with
a
smile
oh
it
was
you
patty
remonstrated
hastily
it
was
just
the
obligatoriness
and
besides
she
added
frankly
my
legitimate
cuts
were
used
up
days
ago
and
when
i
once
begin
i
am
reckless
and
may
i
ask
what
happens
when
you
the
bishop
inquired
well
said
patty
there
are
proctors
you
know
that
mark
you
when
you
are
absent
and
then
if
they
find
that
you
the
committee
calls
you
up
and
asks
the
reason
if
you
produce
a
good
excuse
you
are
deprived
of
your
privileges
for
a
month
and
you
ca
be
on
committees
or
in
plays
or
get
leave
of
absence
to
go
out
of
town
i
see
said
the
bishop
and
will
you
have
to
suffer
all
of
those
penalties
oh
no
said
patty
comfortably
i
shall
produce
a
good
excuse
what
will
you
say
he
inquired
i
do
know
exactly
i
shall
have
to
depend
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
the
bishop
regarded
her
quizzically
do
you
mean
he
asked
that
having
broken
the
rule
you
intend
to
evade
the
penalty
by
to
put
it
flatly
a
falsehood
oh
no
bishop
said
patty
in
a
shocked
tone
of
course
i
shall
tell
the
truth
only
she
looked
up
in
the
bishop
face
with
an
irresistible
smile
the
committee
probably
wo
understand
it
for
an
instant
the
bishop
face
relaxed
and
then
he
grew
grave
again
by
a
subterfuge
he
asked
acknowledged
patty
i
suppose
you
call
it
a
subterfuge
i
dare
say
i
am
pretty
bad
she
added
but
you
have
to
have
a
reputation
for
something
in
a
place
like
this
or
you
get
overlooked
i
ca
compete
in
goodness
or
in
athletics
or
in
anything
like
that
so
there
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
surpass
in
badness
i
have
quite
a
gift
for
it
the
corners
of
the
bishop
mouth
twitched
you
do
look
like
one
with
a
criminal
record
i
young
yet
said
patty
it
has
commenced
to
show
my
dear
little
girl
said
the
bishop
i
have
already
preached
one
sermon
which
you
did
come
to
hear
and
i
ca
undertake
to
preach
another
for
your
benefit
patty
looked
relieved
but
there
is
one
question
i
should
like
to
ask
you
in
after
years
when
you
are
through
college
and
the
question
is
asked
of
some
of
your
you
know
you
have
not
told
me
your
name
patty
wyatt
you
know
patty
wyatt
and
what
sort
of
a
girl
was
she
will
the
answer
be
what
you
would
wish
patty
considered
i
think
on
the
whole
they
stand
by
me
this
morning
the
bishop
continued
placidly
i
asked
a
professor
in
an
entirely
casual
way
about
a
young
woman
a
of
your
own
who
is
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
the
answer
was
immediate
and
unhesitating
and
you
can
imagine
how
much
it
gratified
me
is
not
a
finer
girl
in
college
he
replied
is
honest
in
work
and
honest
in
play
and
thoroughly
conscientious
in
everything
she
does
said
patty
that
must
have
been
priscilla
no
smiled
the
bishop
it
was
not
priscilla
the
young
woman
of
whom
i
am
speaking
is
the
president
of
your
student
association
catherine
fair
yes
it
true
said
patty
critically
cathy
fair
hits
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
would
you
like
to
go
out
with
that
reputation
i
really
not
bad
pleaded
patty
that
is
as
badness
goes
but
i
could
be
as
good
as
cathy
it
would
be
going
against
nature
i
am
afraid
suggested
the
bishop
that
you
do
not
try
very
hard
you
may
not
think
that
it
matters
what
people
think
now
that
you
are
young
but
how
will
it
be
when
you
grow
older
and
it
will
not
be
long
he
added
age
slips
upon
you
before
you
realize
it
patty
looked
sober
you
will
soon
be
thirty
and
then
forty
and
then
fifty
patty
sighed
and
do
you
think
that
a
woman
of
that
age
is
attractive
if
she
deals
in
subterfuges
and
evasions
patty
squirmed
a
trifle
and
dug
a
little
hole
in
the
with
her
toe
you
must
remember
that
you
can
not
form
your
character
in
a
moment
my
dear
character
is
a
plant
of
slow
growth
and
the
seeds
must
be
planted
early
the
bishop
rose
and
patty
scrambled
to
her
feet
with
a
look
of
relief
he
took
the
pillow
and
the
book
under
his
arm
and
they
started
down
the
hill
i
have
preached
you
a
sermon
after
all
he
said
apologetically
but
preaching
is
my
trade
and
you
must
forgive
an
old
man
for
being
prosy
patty
held
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
as
they
stopped
before
the
door
of
phillips
hall
bishop
she
said
and
thank
you
for
the
sermon
i
guess
i
needed
it
i
getting
old
she
climbed
the
stairs
slowly
and
hesitating
a
moment
outside
her
own
room
where
the
sound
of
laughing
voices
through
the
transom
betokened
that
the
clan
was
gathered
she
kept
on
to
the
door
of
a
single
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
come
in
a
voice
called
in
response
to
her
knock
patty
turned
the
knob
and
stuck
her
head
in
hello
cathy
are
you
busy
of
course
not
come
in
and
talk
to
me
patty
shut
the
door
and
leaned
with
her
back
against
it
this
is
a
social
call
she
announced
impressively
i
come
to
see
you
officially
officially
you
president
of
students
i
believe
i
believe
i
am
sighed
cathy
and
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
half
as
much
trouble
with
his
subjects
as
i
have
with
mine
he
has
my
sincerest
sympathy
i
suppose
we
are
a
great
deal
of
trouble
said
patty
contritely
trouble
my
dear
said
cathy
solemnly
i
spent
the
entire
week
running
around
to
the
different
cottages
making
speeches
to
those
blessed
freshmen
they
hand
in
chapel
excuses
and
they
run
off
with
library
books
and
altogether
they
an
immoral
lot
they
can
afford
to
be
they
young
sighed
patty
enviously
but
i
she
added
am
getting
old
and
it
time
i
was
getting
good
called
to
tell
you
that
i
four
times
and
i
have
any
excuse
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
cathy
in
amazement
chapel
excuses
i
four
times
i
think
it
four
though
i
rather
lost
count
and
i
have
any
excuse
but
patty
do
tell
me
that
you
must
have
some
excuse
some
reason
for
not
the
shadow
of
one
just
stayed
away
because
i
did
feel
like
going
but
you
must
give
me
reason
remonstrated
cathy
in
distress
or
i
have
to
report
it
to
the
committee
and
you
be
deprived
of
your
privileges
you
ca
afford
that
you
know
for
you
chairman
of
the
senior
prom
but
i
did
have
any
excuse
and
i
ca
make
one
up
said
patty
i
will
soon
be
thirty
and
then
forty
and
then
fifty
do
you
think
a
woman
of
that
age
is
attractive
if
she
deals
in
subterfuges
and
evasions
character
she
added
solemnly
is
a
plant
of
slow
growth
and
the
seeds
must
be
planted
early
cathy
looked
puzzled
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
she
said
but
i
suppose
you
do
anyway
she
added
i
sorry
about
the
chairmanship
but
i
well
i
sort
of
glad
too
she
laid
a
hand
on
patty
shoulder
of
course
i
always
liked
you
patty
everybody
does
but
i
do
believe
i
ever
appreciated
you
and
i
glad
to
find
it
out
before
we
leave
college
patty
face
flushed
a
trifle
and
she
drew
away
half
sheepishly
best
postpone
your
felicitations
until
she
laughed
for
i
may
think
of
some
good
excuse
in
the
night
she
was
greeted
in
the
study
with
a
cry
of
welcome
well
patty
said
priscilla
i
hear
you
been
taking
a
walk
with
the
bishop
did
you
tell
him
you
cut
chapel
i
did
and
he
said
he
wished
he
might
have
cut
too
she
incorrigible
sighed
georgie
she
even
been
corrupting
the
bishop
you
better
be
careful
patty
wyatt
warned
bonnie
connaught
will
get
you
if
you
do
watch
out
and
be
sorry
when
they
take
you
off
the
senior
prom
patty
sobered
for
a
moment
but
she
hastily
assumed
a
nonchalant
air
they
have
got
me
she
laughed
and
i
already
off
or
at
least
i
shall
be
as
soon
as
they
have
a
meeting
patty
cried
the
room
in
a
horrified
chorus
what
do
you
mean
patty
shrugged
just
what
i
say
deprived
of
my
privileges
for
cutting
chapel
it
a
shame
said
georgie
indignantly
that
committee
is
going
a
little
too
far
when
it
takes
a
senior
privileges
away
without
even
hearing
her
case
she
grasped
patty
by
the
arm
and
started
toward
the
door
come
on
and
tell
cathy
fair
about
it
she
will
fix
it
all
right
patty
hung
back
and
disengaged
her
wrist
from
georgie
grasp
let
me
alone
she
said
sulkily
there
nothing
to
be
done
i
told
her
myself
i
had
any
excuse
you
told
her
georgie
stared
her
incredulity
and
bonnie
connaught
laughed
patty
reminds
me
of
the
burglar
who
crawled
out
the
back
window
with
the
silver
and
then
rang
the
front
and
handed
it
back
what
the
matter
patty
priscilla
asked
solicitously
do
you
feel
well
patty
sighed
i
getting
old
she
said
you
getting
what
old
soon
i
be
thirty
and
then
forty
and
then
fifty
and
do
you
think
any
one
will
love
me
then
if
i
deal
in
subterfuges
and
evasions
character
my
dear
girls
is
a
plant
of
slow
growth
and
the
seeds
must
be
planted
early
you
went
and
told
the
committee
voluntarily
of
your
own
accord
without
even
waiting
to
be
called
up
georgie
persisted
determined
to
get
at
the
facts
of
the
case
i
getting
old
repeated
patty
it
time
i
was
getting
good
as
i
said
before
character
is
a
plant
georgie
looked
at
the
others
and
shook
her
head
in
bewilderment
and
bonnie
connaught
laughed
and
murmured
to
the
room
in
general
when
patty
gets
to
heaven
