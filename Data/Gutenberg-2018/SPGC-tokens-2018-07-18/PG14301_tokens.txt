proofreading
team
first
i
must
warn
you
before
beginning
this
work
not
to
be
surprised
to
hear
me
calling

if
the
following
pages
are
ever
to
see
the
light
of
day
it
will
be
because
they
have
been
stolen
from
me
the
delay
that
i
exact
before
they
shall
be
disclosed
assures
me
of
that
footnote
this
letter
together
with
the
manuscript
which
accompanies
it
the
latter
in
a
separate
sealed
envelope
was
entrusted
by
lieutenant
ferrières
of
the
spahis
the
day
of
the
departure
of
that
officer
for
the
tassili
of
the
tuareg
central
sahara
to
sergeant
chatelain
the
sergeant
was
instructed
to
deliver
it
on
his
next
leave
to
leroux
honorary
counsel
at
the
court
of
appeals
at
riom
and
lieutenant
ferrières
nearest
relative
as
this
magistrate
died
suddenly
before
the
expiration
of
the
term
of
ten
years
set
for
the
publication
of
the
manuscript
here
presented
difficulties
arose
which
have
delayed
its
publication
up
to
the
present
date
as
to
this
disclosure
let
no
one
distrust
my
aim
when
i
prepare
for
it
when
i
insist
upon
it
you
may
believe
me
when
i
maintain
that
no
pride
of
authorship
binds
me
to
these
pages
already
i
am
too
far
removed
from
all
such
things
only
it
is
useless
that
others
should
enter
upon
the
path
from
which
i
shall
not
return
four
in
the
morning
soon
the
sun
will
kindle
the
hamada
with
its
pink
fire
all
about
me
the
bordj
is
asleep
through
the
door
of
his
room
i
hear
andré
de
breathing
quietly
very
quietly
in
two
days
we
shall
start
he
and
i
we
shall
leave
the
bordj
we
shall
penetrate
far
down
there
to
the
south
the
official
orders
came
this
morning
now
even
if
i
wished
to
withdraw
it
is
too
late
andré
and
i
asked
for
this
mission
the
authorization
that
i
sought
together
with
him
has
at
this
moment
become
an
order
the
hierarchic
channels
cleared
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
at
the
ministry
and
then
to
be
afraid
to
recoil
before
this
adventure
to
be
afraid
i
said
i
know
that
i
am
not
afraid
one
night
in
the
gurara
when
i
found
two
of
my
sentinels
slaughtered
with
the
shameful
cross
cut
of
the
berbers
slashed
across
their
stomachs
then
i
was
afraid
i
know
what
fear
is
just
so
now
when
i
gazed
into
the
black
depths
whence
suddenly
all
at
once
the
great
red
sun
will
rise
i
know
that
it
is
not
with
fear
that
i
tremble
i
feel
surging
within
me
the
sacred
horror
of
this
mystery
and
its
irresistible
attraction
delirious
dreams
perhaps
the
mad
imaginings
of
a
brain
surcharged
and
an
eye
distraught
by
mirages
the
day
will
come
doubtless
when
i
shall
reread
these
pages
with
an
indulgent
smile
as
a
man
of
fifty
is
accustomed
to
smile
when
he
rereads
old
letters
delirious
dreams
mad
imaginings
but
these
dreams
these
imaginings
are
dear
to
me
captain
de
and
lieutenant
ferrières
reads
the
official
dispatch
will
proceed
to
tassili
to
determine
the
statigraphic
relation
of
albien
sandstone
and
carboniferous
limestone
they
will
in
addition
profit
by
any
opportunities
of
determining
the
possible
change
of
attitude
of
the
axdjers
towards
our
penetration
etc
if
the
journey
should
indeed
have
to
do
only
with
such
poor
things
i
think
that
i
should
never
undertake
it
so
i
am
longing
for
what
i
dread
i
shall
be
dejected
if
i
do
not
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
what
makes
me
strangely
fearful
in
the
depths
of
the
valley
of
wadi
mia
a
jackal
is
barking
now
and
again
when
a
beam
of
moonlight
breaks
in
a
silver
patch
through
the
hollows
of
the
clouds
making
him
think
he
sees
the
young
sun
a
turtle
dove
moans
among
the
palm
trees
i
hear
a
step
outside
i
lean
out
of
the
window
a
shade
clad
in
luminous
black
stuff
glides
over
the
earth
of
the
terrace
of
the
fortification
a
light
shines
in
the
electric
blackness
a
man
has
just
lighted
a
cigarette
he
crouches
facing
southwards
he
is
smoking
it
is
our
targa
guide
the
man
who
in
three
days
is
to
lead
us
across
the
unknown
plateaus
of
the
mysterious
imoschaoch
across
the
hamadas
of
black
stones
the
great
dried
oases
the
stretches
of
silver
salt
the
tawny
hillocks
the
flat
gold
dunes
that
are
crested
over
when
the
alizé
blows
with
a
shimmering
haze
of
pale
sand
he
is
the
man
there
recurs
to
my
mind
tragic
phrase
at
the
very
moment
the
colonel
was
putting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
was
felled
by
a
sabre
blow
there
he
is
peacefully
smoking
his
cigarette
a
cigarette
from
the
package
that
i
gave
him
may
the
lord
forgive
me
for
it
footnote
duveyrier
the
disaster
of
the
flatters
mission
bull
geol
the
lamp
casts
a
yellow
light
on
the
paper
strange
fate
which
i
never
knew
exactly
why
decided
one
day
when
i
was
a
lad
of
sixteen
that
i
should
prepare
myself
for
saint
cyr
and
gave
me
there
andré
de
as
classmate
i
might
have
studied
law
or
medicine
then
i
should
be
today
a
respectable
inhabitant
of
a
town
with
a
church
and
running
water
instead
of
this
phantom
brooding
with
an
unspeakable
anxiety
over
this
desert
which
is
about
to
swallow
me
a
great
insect
has
flown
in
through
the
window
it
buzzes
strikes
against
the
rough
cast
rebounds
against
the
globe
of
the
lamp
and
then
helpless
its
wings
singed
by
the
still
burning
candle
drops
on
the
white
paper
it
is
an
african
may
bug
big
black
with
spots
of
livid
gray
i
think
of
others
its
brothers
in
france
the
may
bugs
which
i
have
seen
on
stormy
summer
evenings
projecting
themselves
like
little
particles
of
the
soil
of
my
native
countryside
it
was
there
that
as
a
child
i
spent
my
vacations
and
later
on
my
leaves
on
my
last
leave
through
those
same
meadows
there
wandered
beside
me
a
slight
form
wearing
a
thin
scarf
because
of
the
evening
air
so
cool
back
there
but
now
this
memory
stirs
me
so
slightly
that
i
scarcely
raise
my
eyes
to
that
dark
corner
of
my
room
where
the
light
is
dimly
reflected
by
the
glass
of
an
indistinct
portrait
i
realize
of
how
little
consequence
has
become
what
had
seemed
at
one
time
capable
of
filling
all
my
life
this
plaintive
mystery
is
of
no
more
interest
to
me
if
the
strolling
singers
of
rolla
came
to
murmur
their
famous
nostalgic
airs
under
the
window
of
this
bordj
i
know
that
i
should
not
listen
to
them
and
if
they
became
insistent
i
should
send
them
on
their
way
what
has
been
capable
of
causing
this
metamorphosis
in
me
a
story
a
legend
perhaps
told
at
any
rate
by
one
on
whom
rests
the
direst
of
suspicions
has
finished
his
cigarette
i
hear
him
returning
with
slow
steps
to
his
mat
in
barrack

to
the
left
of
the
guard
post
our
departure
being
scheduled
for
the
tenth
of

to

begun
on

the
first
and
finished
on

fifth
of

olivier
ferrières
spahis
i
a
southern
assignment
sunday
the
sixth
of
june
broke
the
monotony
of
the
life
that
we
were
leading
at
the
post
of
by
two
events
of
unequal
importance
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
mlle
de
c
and
the
latest
numbers
of
the
official
journal
of
the
french
republic
i
have
the
lieutenant
permission
said
sergeant
chatelain
beginning
to
glance
through
the
magazines
he
had
just
removed
from
their
wrappings
i
acquiesced
with
a
nod
already
completely
absorbed
in
reading
mlle
de
c
letter
when
this
reaches
you
was
the
gist
of
this
charming
being
letter
mama
and
i
will
doubtless
have
left
paris
for
the
country
if
in
your
distant
parts
it
might
be
a
consolation
to
imagine
me
as
bored
here
as
you
possibly
can
be
make
the
most
of
it
the
grand
prix
is
over
i
played
the
horse
you
pointed
out
to
me
and
naturally
i
lost
last
night
we
dined
with
the
martials
de
la
touche
elias
chatrian
was
there
always
amazingly
young
i
am
sending
you
his
last
book
which
has
made
quite
a
sensation
it
seems
that
the
martials
de
la
touche
are
depicted
there
without
disguise
i
will
add
to
it
bourget
last
and
loti
and
france
and
two
or
three
of
the
latest
music
hall
hits
in
the
political
word
they
say
the
law
about
congregations
will
meet
with
strenuous
opposition
nothing
much
in
the
theatres
i
have
taken
out
a
summer
subscription
for
would
you
care
for
it
in
the
country
no
one
knows
what
to
do
always
the
same
lot
of
idiots
ready
for
tennis
i
shall
deserve
no
credit
for
writing
to
you
often
spare
me
your
reflections
concerning
young
combemale
i
am
less
than
nothing
of
a
feminist
having
too
much
faith
in
those
who
tell
me
that
i
am
pretty
in
yourself
in
particular
but
indeed
i
grow
wild
at
the
idea
that
if
i
permitted
myself
half
the
familiarities
with
one
of
our
lads
that
you
have
surely
with
your
enough
of
that
it
is
too
unpleasant
an
idea
i
had
reached
this
point
in
the
prose
of
this
advanced
young
woman
when
a
scandalized
exclamation
of
the
sergeant
made
me
look
up
lieutenant
yes
they
are
up
to
something
at
the
ministry
see
for
yourself
he
handed
me
the
official
i
read
by
a
decision
of
the
first
of
may
captain
de
andré
unattached
is
assigned
to
the
third
spahis
and
appointed
commandant
of
the
post
of
chatelain
displeasure
became
fairly
exuberant
captain
de
commandant
of
the
post
a
post
which
has
never
had
a
slur
upon
it
they
must
take
us
for
a
dumping
ground
my
surprise
was
as
great
as
the
sergeant
but
just
then
i
saw
the
evil
face
of
gourrut
the
convict
we
used
as
clerk
he
had
stopped
his
scrawling
and
was
listening
with
a
sly
interest
sergeant
captain
de
is
my
ranking
classmate
i
answered
dryly
chatelain
saluted
and
left
the
room
i
followed
there
there
i
said
clapping
him
on
the
back
no
hard
feelings
remember
that
in
an
hour
we
are
starting
for
the
oasis
have
the
cartridges
ready
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
restock
the
larder
i
went
back
to
the
office
and
motioned
gourrut
to
go
left
alone
i
finished
mlle
de
c
letter
very
quickly
and
then
reread
the
decision
of
the
ministry
giving
the
post
a
new
chief
it
was
now
five
months
that
i
had
enjoyed
that
distinction
and
on
my
word
i
had
accepted
the
responsibility
well
enough
and
been
very
well
pleased
with
the
independence
i
can
even
affirm
without
taking
too
much
credit
for
myself
that
under
my
command
discipline
had
been
better
maintained
than
under
captain
dieulivol
predecessor
a
brave
man
this
captain
dieulivol
a
officer
under
dodds
and
duchesne
but
subject
to
a
terrible
propensity
for
strong
liquors
and
too
much
inclined
when
he
had
drunk
to
confuse
his
dialects
and
to
talk
to
a
houassa
in
sakalave
no
one
was
ever
more
sparing
of
the
post
water
supply
one
morning
when
he
was
preparing
his
absinthe
in
the
presence
of
the
sergeant
chatelain
noticing
the
captain
glass
saw
with
amazement
that
the
green
liquor
was
blanched
by
a
far
stronger
admixture
of
water
than
usual
he
looked
up
aware
that
something
abnormal
had
just
occurred
rigid
the
carafe
inverted
in
his
hand
captain
dieulivol
was
spilling
the
water
which
was
running
over
on
the
sugar
he
was
dead
for
six
months
since
the
disappearance
of
this
sympathetic
old
tippler
the
powers
had
not
seemed
to
interest
themselves
in
finding
his
successor
i
had
even
hoped
at
times
that
a
decision
might
be
reached
investing
me
with
the
rights
that
i
was
in
fact
exercising
and
today
this
surprising
appointment
captain
de
he
was
of
my
class
at
cyr
i
had
lost
track
of
him
then
my
attention
had
been
attracted
to
him
by
his
rapid
advancement
his
decoration
the
recognition
of
three
particularly
daring
expeditions
of
exploration
to
tebesti
and
the
air
and
suddenly
the
mysterious
drama
of
his
fourth
expedition
that
famous
mission
undertaken
with
captain
morhange
from
which
only
one
of
the
explorers
came
back
everything
is
forgotten
quickly
in
france
that
was
at
least
six
years
ago
i
had
not
heard
mentioned
since
i
had
even
supposed
that
he
had
left
the
army
and
now
i
was
to
have
him
as
my
chief
after
all
what
the
difference
i
mused
he
or
another
at
school
he
was
charming
and
we
have
had
only
the
most
pleasant
relationships
besides
i
have
enough
yearly
income
to
afford
the
rank
of
captain
and
i
left
the
office
whistling
as
i
went
we
were
now
chatelain
and
i
our
guns
resting
on
the
already
cooling
earth
beside
the
pool
that
forms
the
center
of
the
meager
oasis
hidden
behind
a
kind
of
hedge
of
alfa
the
setting
sun
was
reddening
the
stagnant
ditches
which
irrigate
the
poor
garden
plots
of
the
sedentary
blacks
not
a
word
during
the
approach
not
a
word
during
the
shoot
chatelain
was
obviously
sulking
in
silence
we
knocked
down
one
after
the
other
several
of
the
miserable
doves
which
came
on
dragging
wings
heavy
with
the
heat
of
the
day
to
quench
their
thirst
at
the
thick
green
water
when
a
slaughtered
little
bodies
were
lined
up
at
our
feet
i
put
my
hand
on
the
sergeant
shoulder
chatelain
he
trembled
chatelain
i
was
rude
to
you
a
little
while
ago
do
be
angry
it
was
the
bad
time
before
the
siesta
the
bad
time
of
midday
the
lieutenant
is
master
here
he
answered
in
a
tone
that
was
meant
to
be
gruff
but
which
was
only
strained
chatelain
do
be
angry
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
know
really
no
i
do
know
chatelain
chatelain
why
not
be
sensible
tell
me
something
about
captain
de
i
know
nothing
he
spoke
sharply
nothing
then
what
were
you
saying
a
little
while
ago
captain
de
is
a
brave
man
he
muttered
the
words
with
his
head
still
obstinately
bent
he
went
alone
to
bilma
to
the
air
quite
alone
to
those
places
where
no
one
had
ever
been
he
is
a
brave
man
he
is
a
brave
man
undoubtedly
i
answered
with
great
restraint
but
he
murdered
his
companion
captain
morhange
did
he
not
the
old
sergeant
trembled
he
is
a
brave
man
he
persisted
chatelain
you
are
a
child
are
you
afraid
that
i
am
going
to
repeat
what
you
say
to
your
new
captain
i
had
touched
him
to
the
quick
he
drew
himself
up
sergeant
chatelain
is
afraid
of
no
one
lieutenant
he
has
been
at
abomey
against
the
amazons
in
a
country
where
a
black
arm
started
out
from
every
bush
to
seize
your
leg
while
another
cut
it
off
for
you
with
one
blow
of
a
cutlass
then
what
they
say
what
you
yourself
that
is
talk
talk
which
is
repeated
in
france
chatelain
everywhere
he
bent
his
head
still
lower
without
replying
ass
i
burst
out
will
you
speak
lieutenant
lieutenant
he
fairly
pled
i
swear
that
what
i
know
or
nothing
what
you
know
you
are
going
to
tell
me
and
right
away
if
not
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
for
a
month
i
shall
not
speak
to
you
except
on
official
business
thirty
native
arabs
and
four
europeans
myself
the
sergeant
a
corporal
and
gourrut
the
threat
was
terrible
it
had
its
effect
all
right
then
lieutenant
he
said
with
a
great
sigh
but
afterwards
you
must
not
blame
me
for
having
told
you
things
about
a
superior
which
should
not
be
told
and
come
only
from
the
talk
i
overheard
at
mess
tell
away
it
was
in
i
was
then
mess
sergeant
at
sfax
with
the
spahis
i
had
a
good
record
and
besides
as
i
did
not
drink
the
adjutant
had
assigned
me
to
the
officers
mess
it
was
a
soft
berth
the
marketing
the
accounts
recording
the
library
books
which
were
borrowed
there
were
many
and
the
key
of
the
wine
cupboard
for
with
that
you
ca
trust
orderlies
the
colonel
was
young
and
dined
at
mess
one
evening
he
came
in
late
looking
perturbed
and
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
called
for
silence
he
said
have
a
communication
to
make
to
you
and
i
shall
ask
for
your
advice
here
is
the
question
tomorrow
morning
the
of
lands
at
sfax
aboard
her
is
captain
de
recently
assigned
to
feriana
en
route
to
his
post
the
colonel
paused
thought
i
menu
is
about
to
be
considered
for
you
know
the
custom
lieutenant
which
has
existed
ever
since
there
have
been
any
officers
clubs
in
africa
when
an
officer
is
passing
by
his
comrades
go
to
meet
him
at
the
boat
and
invite
him
to
remain
with
them
for
the
length
of
his
stay
in
port
he
pays
his
score
in
news
from
home
on
such
occasions
everything
is
of
the
best
even
for
a
simple
lieutenant
at
sfax
an
officer
on
a
visit
meant
one
extra
course
vintage
wine
and
old
liqueurs
but
this
time
i
imagined
from
the
looks
the
officers
exchanged
that
perhaps
the
old
stock
would
stay
undisturbed
in
its
cupboard
have
all
i
think
heard
of
captain
de
gentlemen
and
the
rumors
about
him
it
is
not
for
us
to
inquire
into
them
and
the
promotion
he
has
had
his
decoration
if
you
will
permits
us
to
hope
that
they
are
without
foundation
but
between
not
suspecting
an
officer
of
being
a
criminal
and
receiving
him
at
our
table
as
a
comrade
there
is
a
gulf
that
we
are
not
obliged
to
bridge
that
is
the
matter
on
which
i
ask
your
advice
there
was
silence
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
all
of
them
suddenly
quite
grave
even
to
the
merriest
of
the
second
lieutenants
in
the
corner
where
i
realized
that
they
had
forgotten
me
i
tried
not
to
make
the
least
sound
that
might
recall
my
presence
thank
you
colonel
one
of
the
majors
finally
replied
your
courtesy
in
consulting
us
all
my
comrades
i
imagine
know
to
what
terrible
rumors
you
refer
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
in
paris
at
the
army
geographical
service
where
i
was
before
coming
here
most
of
the
officers
of
the
highest
standing
had
an
opinion
on
this
unfortunate
matter
which
they
avoided
stating
but
which
cast
no
glory
upon
captain
de
was
at
bammako
at
the
time
of
the
mission
said
a
captain
opinion
of
the
officers
there
i
am
sorry
to
say
differed
very
little
from
what
the
major
describes
but
i
must
add
that
they
all
admitted
that
they
had
nothing
but
suspicions
to
go
on
and
suspicions
are
certainly
not
enough
considering
the
atrocity
of
the
affair
are
quite
enough
gentlemen
replied
the
colonel
account
for
our
hesitation
it
is
not
a
question
of
passing
judgment
but
no
man
can
sit
at
our
table
as
a
matter
of
right
it
is
a
privilege
based
on
fraternal
esteem
the
only
question
is
whether
it
is
your
decision
to
accord
it
to
so
saying
he
looked
at
the
officers
as
if
he
were
taking
a
roll
call
one
after
another
they
shook
their
heads
see
that
we
agree
he
said
our
task
is
unfortunately
not
yet
over
the
of
will
be
in
port
tomorrow
morning
the
launch
which
meets
the
passengers
leaves
at
eight
it
will
be
necessary
gentlemen
for
one
of
you
to
go
aboard
captain
de
might
be
expecting
to
come
to
us
we
certainly
have
no
intention
of
inflicting
upon
him
the
humiliation
of
refusing
him
if
he
presented
himself
in
expectation
of
the
customary
reception
he
must
be
prevented
from
coming
it
will
be
wisest
to
make
him
understand
that
it
is
best
for
him
to
stay
aboard
the
colonel
looked
at
the
officers
again
they
could
not
but
agree
but
how
uncomfortable
each
one
looked
can
not
hope
to
find
a
volunteer
among
you
for
this
kind
of
mission
so
i
am
compelled
to
appoint
some
one
captain
grandjean
captain
de
is
also
a
captain
it
is
fitting
that
it
be
an
officer
of
his
own
rank
who
carries
him
our
message
besides
you
are
the
latest
comer
here
therefore
it
is
to
you
that
i
entrust
this
painful
interview
i
do
not
need
to
suggest
that
you
conduct
it
as
diplomatically
as
possible
captain
grandjean
bowed
while
a
sigh
of
relief
escaped
from
all
the
others
as
long
as
the
colonel
stayed
in
the
room
grandjean
remained
apart
without
speaking
it
was
only
after
the
chief
had
departed
that
he
let
fall
the
words
are
some
things
that
ought
to
count
a
good
deal
for
promotion
the
next
day
at
luncheon
everyone
was
impatient
for
his
return
demanded
the
colonel
briefly
captain
grandjean
did
not
reply
immediately
he
sat
down
at
the
table
where
his
comrades
were
mixing
their
drinks
and
he
a
man
notorious
for
sobriety
drank
almost
at
a
gulp
without
waiting
for
the
sugar
to
melt
a
full
glass
of
absinthe
captain
repeated
the
colonel
colonel
it
done
you
can
be
at
ease
he
will
not
set
foot
on
shore
but
ye
gods
what
an
ordeal
the
officers
did
not
dare
speak
only
their
looks
expressed
their
anxious
curiosity
captain
grandjean
poured
himself
a
swallow
of
water
see
i
had
gotten
my
speech
all
ready
in
the
launch
but
as
i
went
up
the
ladder
i
knew
that
i
had
forgotten
it
was
in
the
with
the
captain
of
the
boat
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
never
find
the
strength
to
tell
him
when
i
saw
him
all
ready
to
go
ashore
he
was
in
full
dress
uniform
his
sabre
lay
on
the
bench
and
he
was
wearing
spurs
no
one
wears
spurs
on
shipboard
i
presented
myself
and
we
exchanged
several
remarks
but
i
must
have
seemed
somewhat
strained
for
from
the
first
moment
i
knew
that
he
sensed
something
under
some
pretext
he
left
the
captain
and
led
me
aft
near
the
great
rudder
wheel
there
i
dared
speak
colonel
what
did
i
say
how
i
must
have
stammered
he
did
not
look
at
me
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
railing
he
let
his
eyes
wander
far
off
smiling
slightly
then
of
a
sudden
when
i
was
well
tangled
up
in
explanations
he
looked
at
me
coolly
and
said
must
thank
you
my
dear
fellow
for
having
given
yourself
so
much
trouble
but
it
is
quite
unnecessary
i
am
out
of
sorts
and
have
no
intention
of
going
ashore
at
least
i
have
the
pleasure
of
having
made
your
acquaintance
since
i
can
not
profit
by
your
hospitality
you
must
do
me
the
favor
of
accepting
mine
as
long
as
the
launch
stays
by
the
vessel
then
we
went
back
to
the
he
himself
mixed
the
cocktails
he
talked
to
me
we
discovered
that
we
had
mutual
acquaintances
never
shall
i
forget
that
face
that
ironic
and
distant
look
that
sad
and
melodious
voice
ah
colonel
gentlemen
i
know
what
they
may
say
at
the
geographic
office
or
in
the
posts
of
the
soudan
there
can
be
nothing
in
it
but
a
horrible
suspicion
such
a
man
capable
of
such
a
crime
believe
me
it
is
not
possible
that
is
all
lieutenant
finished
chatelain
after
a
silence
i
have
never
seen
a
sadder
meal
than
that
one
the
officers
hurried
through
lunch
without
a
word
being
spoken
in
an
atmosphere
of
depression
against
which
no
one
tried
to
struggle
and
in
this
complete
silence
you
could
see
them
always
furtively
watching
the
of
where
she
was
dancing
merrily
in
the
breeze
a
league
from
shore
she
was
still
there
in
the
evening
when
they
assembled
for
dinner
and
it
was
not
until
a
blast
of
the
whistle
followed
by
curls
of
smoke
escaping
from
the
red
and
black
smokestack
had
announced
the
departure
of
the
vessel
for
gabes
that
conversation
was
resumed
and
even
then
less
gaily
than
usual
after
that
lieutenant
at
the
officers
club
at
sfax
they
avoided
like
the
plague
any
subject
which
risked
leading
the
conversation
back
to
captain
de
chatelain
had
spoken
almost
in
a
whisper
and
the
little
people
of
the
desert
had
not
heard
this
singular
history
it
was
an
hour
since
we
had
fired
our
last
cartridge
around
the
pool
the
turtle
doves
once
more
reassured
were
bathing
their
feathers
mysterious
great
birds
were
flying
under
the
darkening
palm
trees
a
less
warm
wind
rocked
the
trembling
black
palm
branches
we
had
laid
aside
our
helmets
so
that
our
temples
could
welcome
the
touch
of
the
feeble
breeze
chatelain
i
said
it
is
time
to
go
back
to
the
bordj
slowly
we
picked
up
the
dead
doves
i
felt
the
sergeant
looking
at
me
reproachfully
as
if
regretting
that
he
had
spoken
yet
during
all
the
time
that
our
return
trip
lasted
i
could
not
find
the
strength
to
break
our
desolate
silence
with
a
single
word
the
night
had
almost
fallen
when
we
arrived
the
flag
which
surmounted
the
post
was
still
visible
drooping
on
its
standard
but
already
its
colors
were
indistinguishable
to
the
west
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
dunes
gashed
against
the
black
violet
of
the
sky
when
we
had
crossed
the
gate
of
the
fortifications
chatelain
left
me
i
am
going
to
the
stables
he
said
i
returned
alone
to
that
part
of
the
fort
where
the
billets
for
the
europeans
and
the
stores
of
ammunition
were
located
an
inexpressible
sadness
weighed
upon
me
i
thought
of
my
comrades
in
french
garrisons
at
this
hour
they
must
be
returning
home
to
find
awaiting
them
spread
out
upon
the
bed
their
dress
uniform
their
braided
tunic
their
sparkling
epaulettes
tomorrow
i
said
to
myself
i
shall
request
a
change
of
station
the
stairway
of
earth
was
already
black
but
a
few
gleams
of
light
still
seemed
palely
prowling
in
the
office
when
i
entered
a
man
was
sitting
at
my
desk
bending
over
the
files
of
orders
his
back
was
toward
me
he
did
not
hear
me
enter
really
gourrut
my
lad
i
beg
you
not
to
disturb
yourself
make
yourself
completely
at
home
the
man
had
risen
and
i
saw
him
to
be
quite
tall
slender
and
very
pale
lieutenant
ferrières
is
it
not
he
advanced
holding
out
his
hand
captain
de
delighted
my
dear
fellow
at
the
same
time
chatelain
appeared
on
the
threshold
sergeant
said
the
newcomer
i
can
not
congratulate
you
on
the
little
i
have
seen
there
is
not
a
camel
saddle
which
is
not
in
want
of
buckles
and
they
are
rusty
enough
to
suggest
that
it
rains
at
three
hundred
days
in
the
year
furthermore
where
were
you
this
afternoon
among
the
four
frenchmen
who
compose
the
post
i
found
only
on
my
arrival
one
convict
opposite
a
quart
of
we
will
change
all
that
i
hope
at
ease
captain
i
said
and
my
voice
was
colorless
while
chatelain
remained
frozen
at
attention
i
must
tell
you
that
the
sergeant
was
with
me
that
it
is
i
who
am
responsible
for
his
absence
from
the
post
that
he
is
an
irreproachable
officer
from
every
point
of
view
and
that
if
we
had
been
warned
of
your
arrival
evidently
he
said
with
a
coldly
ironical
smile
also
lieutenant
i
have
no
intention
of
holding
him
responsible
for
the
negligences
which
attach
to
your
office
he
is
not
obliged
to
know
that
the
officer
who
abandons
a
post
like
if
it
is
only
for
two
hours
risks
not
finding
much
left
on
his
return
the
chaamba
brigands
my
dear
sir
love
firearms
and
for
the
sake
of
the
sixty
muskets
in
your
racks
i
am
sure
they
would
not
scruple
to
make
an
officer
whose
otherwise
excellent
record
is
well
known
to
me
account
for
his
absence
to
a
come
with
me
if
you
please
we
will
finish
the
little
inspection
i
began
too
rapidly
a
little
while
ago
he
was
already
on
the
stairs
i
followed
in
his
footsteps
chatelain
closed
the
order
of
march
i
heard
him
murmuring
in
a
tone
which
you
can
imagine
well
we
are
in
for
it
now
ii
captain
de
a
few
days
sufficed
to
convince
us
that
chatelain
fears
as
to
our
official
relations
with
the
new
chief
were
vain
often
i
have
thought
that
by
the
severity
he
showed
at
our
first
encounter
wished
to
create
a
formal
barrier
to
show
us
that
he
knew
how
to
keep
his
head
high
in
spite
of
the
weight
of
his
heavy
past
certain
it
is
that
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
showed
himself
in
a
very
different
light
even
complimenting
the
sergeant
on
the
upkeep
of
the
post
and
the
instruction
of
the
men
to
me
he
was
charming
we
are
of
the
same
class
are
we
he
said
to
me
i
do
have
to
ask
you
to
dispense
with
formalities
it
is
your
right
vain
marks
of
confidence
alas
false
witnesses
to
a
freedom
of
spirit
one
in
face
of
the
other
what
more
accessible
in
appearance
than
the
immense
sahara
open
to
all
those
who
are
willing
to
be
engulfed
by
it
yet
what
is
more
secret
after
six
months
of
companionship
of
communion
of
life
such
as
only
a
post
in
the
south
offers
i
ask
myself
if
the
most
extraordinary
of
my
adventures
is
not
to
be
leaving
toward
unsounded
solitudes
with
a
man
whose
real
thoughts
are
as
unknown
to
me
as
these
same
solitudes
for
which
he
has
succeeded
in
making
me
long
the
first
surprise
which
was
given
me
by
this
singular
companion
was
occasioned
by
the
baggage
that
followed
him
on
his
inopportune
arrival
alone
from
wargla
he
had
trusted
to
the
mehari
he
rode
only
what
can
be
carried
without
harm
by
such
a
delicate
beast
his
arms
sabre
and
revolver
a
heavy
carbine
and
a
very
reduced
pack
the
rest
did
not
arrive
till
fifteen
days
later
with
the
convoy
which
supplied
the
post
three
cases
of
respectable
dimensions
were
carried
one
after
another
to
the
captain
room
and
the
grimaces
of
the
porters
said
enough
as
to
their
weight
i
discreetly
left
to
his
unpacking
and
began
opening
the
mail
which
the
convoy
had
sent
me
he
returned
to
the
office
a
little
later
and
glanced
at
the
several
reviews
which
i
had
just
recieved
so
he
said
you
take
these
he
skimmed
through
as
he
spoke
the
last
number
of
the
der
gesellschaft
fur
erdkunde
in
yes
i
answered
these
gentlemen
are
kind
enough
to
interest
themselves
in
my
works
on
the
geology
of
the
wadi
mia
and
the
high
igharghar
that
may
be
useful
to
me
he
murmured
continuing
to
turn
over
the
leaves
it
at
your
service
thanks
i
am
afraid
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
in
exchange
except
pliny
perhaps
and
still
you
know
what
he
said
of
igharghar
according
to
king
juba
however
come
help
me
put
my
traps
in
place
and
you
will
see
if
anything
appeals
to
you
i
accepted
without
further
urging
we
commenced
by
unearthing
various
meteorological
and
astronomical
instruments
the
thermometers
of
baudin
salleron
fastre
an
aneroid
a
fortin
barometer
chronometers
a
sextant
an
astronomical
spyglass
a
compass
glass
in
short
what
duveyrier
calls
the
material
that
is
simplest
and
easiest
to
transport
on
a
camel
as
handed
them
to
me
i
arranged
them
on
the
only
table
in
the
room
now
he
announced
to
me
there
is
nothing
more
but
books
i
will
pass
them
to
you
pile
them
up
in
a
corner
until
i
can
have
a
made
for
two
hours
altogether
i
helped
him
to
heap
up
a
real
library
and
what
a
library
such
as
never
before
a
post
in
the
south
had
seen
all
the
texts
consecrated
under
whatever
titles
by
antiquity
to
the
regions
of
the
sahara
were
reunited
between
the
four
walls
of
that
little
room
of
the
bordj
herodotus
and
pliny
naturally
and
likewise
strabo
and
ptolemy
pomponius
mela
and
ammien
marcellin
but
besides
these
names
which
reassured
my
ignorance
a
little
i
perceived
those
of
corippus
of
paul
orose
of
eratosthenes
of
photius
of
diodorus
of
sicily
of
solon
of
dion
cassius
of

of
seville
of
martin

of
ethicus
of
athenée
the
historiae
the
antonini
the
latini
of
riese
the
graeci
of

muller
since
i
have
had
the
occasion
to
familiarize
myself
with
agatarchides
of
cos
and
artemidorus
of
ephesus
but
i
admit
that
in
this
instance
the
presence
of
their
dissertations
in
the
saddle
bags
of
a
captain
of
cavalry
caused
me
some
amazement
i
mention
further
the
dell
by
leon
the
of
of
of
of
of
mahommed
in
the
midst
of
this
babel
i
remember
the
names
of
only
two
volumes
of
contemporary
french
scholars
there
were
also
the
laborious
theses
of
berlioux
and
of
schirmer

while
i
proceeded
to
make
piles
of
as
similar
dimensions
as
possible
i
kept
saying
to
myself
to
think
that
i
have
been
believing
all
this
time
that
in
his
mission
with
morhange
was
particularly
concerned
in
scientific
observations
either
my
memory
deceives
me
strangely
or
he
is
riding
a
horse
of
another
color
what
is
sure
is
that
there
is
nothing
for
me
in
the
midst
of
all
this
chaos
he
must
have
read
on
my
face
the
signs
of
too
apparently
expressed
surprise
for
he
said
in
a
tone
in
which
i
divined
a
tinge
of
defiance
the
choice
of
these
books
surprises
you
a
bit
i
ca
say
it
surprises
me
i
replied
since
i
do
know
the
nature
of
the
work
for
which
you
have
collected
them
in
any
case
i
dare
say
without
fear
of
being
contradicted
that
never
before
has
officer
of
the
arabian
office
possessed
a
library
in
which
the
humanities
were
so
well
represented
he
smiled
evasively
and
that
day
we
pursued
the
subject
no
further
among
books
i
had
noticed
a
voluminous
notebook
secured
by
a
strong
lock
several
times
i
surprised
him
in
the
act
of
making
notations
in
it
when
for
any
reason
he
was
called
out
of
the
room
he
placed
his
album
carefully
in
a
small
cabinet
of
white
wood
provided
by
the
munificence
of
the
administration
when
he
was
not
writing
and
the
office
did
not
require
his
presence
he
had
the
mehari
which
he
had
brought
with
him
saddled
and
a
few
minutes
later
from
the
terrace
of
the
fortifications
i
could
see
the
double
silhouette
disappearing
with
great
strides
behind
a
hummock
of
red
earth
on
the
horizon
each
time
these
trips
lasted
longer
from
each
he
returned
in
a
kind
of
exaltation
which
made
me
watch
him
with
daily
increasing
disquietude
during
meal
hours
the
only
time
we
passed
quite
alone
together
well
i
said
to
myself
one
day
when
his
remarks
had
been
more
lacking
in
sequence
than
usual
it
no
fun
being
aboard
a
submarine
when
the
captain
takes
opium
what
drug
can
this
fellow
be
taking
anyway
next
day
i
looked
hurriedly
through
my
comrade
drawers
this
inspection
which
i
believed
to
be
my
duty
reassured
me
momentarily
all
very
good
i
thought
provided
he
does
not
carry
with
him
his
capsules
and
his
pravaz
syringe
i
was
still
in
that
stage
where
i
could
suppose
that
imagination
needed
artificial
stimulants
meticulous
observation
undeceived
me
there
was
nothing
suspicious
in
this
respect
moreover
he
rarely
drank
and
almost
never
smoked
and
nevertheless
there
was
no
means
of
denying
the
increase
of
his
disquieting
feverishness
he
returned
from
his
expeditions
each
time
with
his
eyes
more
brilliant
he
was
paler
more
animated
more
irritable
one
evening
he
left
the
post
about
six
at
the
end
of
the
greatest
heat
of
the
day
we
waited
for
him
all
night
my
anxiety
was
all
the
stronger
because
quite
recently
caravans
had
brought
tidings
of
bands
of
robbers
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
post
at
dawn
he
had
not
returned
he
did
not
come
before
midday
his
camel
collapsed
under
him
rather
than
knelt
he
realized
that
he
must
excuse
himself
but
he
waited
till
we
were
alone
at
lunch
i
am
so
sorry
to
have
caused
you
any
anxiety
but
the
dunes
were
so
beautiful
under
the
moon
i
let
myself
be
carried
farther
and
farther
i
have
no
reproaches
to
make
dear
fellow
you
are
free
and
the
chief
here
only
allow
me
to
recall
to
you
certain
warnings
concerning
the
chaamba
brigands
and
the
misfortunes
that
might
arise
from
a
commandant
of
a
post
absenting
himself
too
long
he
smiled
i
do
dislike
such
evidence
of
a
good
memory
he
said
simply
he
was
in
excellent
too
excellent
spirits
do
blame
me
i
set
out
for
a
short
ride
as
usual
then
the
moon
rose
and
then
i
recognized
the
country
it
is
just
where
twenty
years
ago
next
november
flatters
followed
the
way
to
his
destiny
in
an
exaltation
which
the
certainty
of
not
returning
made
keener
and
more
intense
strange
state
of
mind
for
a
chief
of
an
expedition
i
murmured
say
nothing
against
flatters
no
man
ever
loved
the
desert
as
he
did
even
to
dying
of
it
palat
and
douls
among
many
others
have
loved
it
as
much
i
answered
but
they
were
alone
when
they
exposed
themselves
to
it
responsible
only
for
their
own
lives
they
were
free
flatters
on
the
other
hand
was
responsible
for
sixty
lives
and
you
can
not
deny
that
he
allowed
his
whole
party
to
be
massacred
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
lips
before
i
regretted
them
i
thought
of
chatelain
story
of
the
officers
club
at
sfax
where
they
avoided
like
the
plague
any
kind
of
conversation
which
might
lead
their
thoughts
toward
a
certain
mission
happily
i
observed
that
my
companion
was
not
listening
his
brilliant
eyes
were
far
away
what
was
your
first
garrison
he
asked
suddenly
auxonne
he
gave
an
unnatural
laugh
auxonne
province
of
the
cote
district
of
dijon
six
thousand

railway
drill
school

the
wife

and
the
major

leaves
every
sunday
the
first
of
the
month
to
paris
the
three
others
to
dijon
that
explains
your
judgment
of
flatters
for
my
part
my
dear
fellow
my
first
garrison
was
at
boghar
i
arrived
there
one
morning
in
october
a
second
lieutenant
aged
twenty
of
the
first
african
batallion
the
white
chevron
on
my
black
sleeve
sun
stripe
as
the
say
in
speaking
of
their
grades
boghar
two
days
before
from
the
bridge
of
the
steamer
i
had
begun
to
see
the
shores
of
africa
i
pity
all
those
who
when
they
see
those
pale
cliffs
for
the
first
time
do
not
feel
a
great
leap
at
their
hearts
at
the
thought
that
this
land
prolongs
itself
thousands
and
thousands
of
leagues
i
was
little
more
than
a
child
i
had
plenty
of
money
i
was
ahead
of
schedule
i
could
have
stopped
three
or
four
days
at
algiers
to
amuse
myself
instead
i
took
the
train
that
same
evening
for
berroughia
there
scarcely
a
hundred
kilometers
from
algiers
the
railway
stopped
going
in
a
straight
line
you
wo
find
another
until
you
get
to
the
cape
the
diligence
travels
at
night
on
account
of
the
heat
when
we
came
to
the
hills
i
got
out
and
walked
beside
the
carriage
straining
for
the
sensation
in
this
new
atmosphere
of
the
kiss
of
the
outlying
desert
about
midnight
at
the
camp
of
the
zouaves
a
humble
post
on
the
road
embankment
overlooking
a
dry
valley
whence
rose
the
feverish
perfume
of
oleander
we
changed
horses
they
had
there
a
troop
of
convicts
and
impressed
laborers
under
escort
of
riflemen
and
convoys
to
the
quarries
in
the
south
in
part
rogues
in
uniform
from
the
jails
of
algiers
and
douara
without
arms
of
course
the
others
civilians
such
civilians
this
year
recruits
the
young
bullies
of
the
chapelle
and
the
they
left
before
we
did
then
the
diligence
caught
up
with
them
from
a
distance
i
saw
in
a
pool
of
moonlight
on
the
yellow
road
the
black
irregular
mass
of
the
convoy
then
i
heard
a
weary
dirge
the
wretches
were
singing
one
in
a
sad
and
gutteral
voice
gave
the
couplet
which
trailed
dismally
through
the
depths
of
the
blue
ravines
est
grande
elle
fait
le
trottoir
avec
ceux
de
la
bande
a
and
the
others
took
up
in
chorus
the
horrible
refrain
la
bastille
a
la
bastille
on
aime
bien
on
aime
bien
nini
peau
elle
est
si
belle
et
si
gentille
a
la
i
saw
them
all
in
contrast
to
myself
when
the
diligence
passed
them
they
were
terrible
under
the
hideous
searchlight
their
eyes
shone
with
a
sombre
fire
in
their
pale
and
shaven
faces
the
burning
dust
strangled
their
raucous
voices
in
their
throats
a
frightful
sadness
took
possession
of
me
when
the
diligence
had
left
this
fearful
nightmare
behind
i
regained
my
much
further
south
i
exclaimed
to
myself
the
places
untouched
by
this
miserable
bilgewater
of
civilization
when
i
am
weary
when
i
have
a
moment
of
anguish
and
longing
to
turn
back
on
the
road
that
i
have
chosen
i
think
of
the
prisoners
of
berroughia
and
then
i
am
glad
to
continue
on
my
way
but
what
a
reward
when
i
am
in
one
of
those
places
where
the
poor
animals
never
think
of
fleeing
because
they
have
never
seen
man
where
the
desert
stretches
out
around
me
so
widely
that
the
old
world
could
crumble
and
never
a
single
ripple
on
the
dune
a
single
cloud
in
the
white
sky
come
to
warn
me
is
true
i
murmured
too
once
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
at
i
felt
that
way
up
to
that
time
i
had
let
him
enjoy
his
exaltations
without
interruption
i
understood
too
late
the
error
that
i
had
made
in
pronouncing
that
unfortunate
sentence
his
mocking
nervous
laughter
began
anew
ah
indeed
at
i
beg
you
old
man
in
your
own
interest
if
you
do
want
to
make
an
ass
of
yourself
avoid
that
species
of
reminiscence
honestly
you
make
me
think
of
fromentin
or
that
poor
maupassant
who
talked
of
the
desert
because
he
had
been
to
djelfa
two
days
journey
from
the
street
of
and
the
government
buildings
four
days
from
the
avenue
de
and
who
because
he
saw
a
poor
devil
of
a
camel
dying
near
believed
himself
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
on
the
old
route
of
the
caravans
the
desert
it
seems
to
me
however
that
i
said
a
little
vexed
but
my
poor
friend
the
last
time
that
i
passed
that
way
there
were
as
many
old
newspapers
and
empty
sardine
boxes
as
if
it
had
been
sunday
in
the
wood
of
vincennes
such
a
determined
such
an
evident
desire
to
annoy
me
made
me
forget
my
reserve
evidently
i
replied
resentfully
i
have
never
been
to
i
stopped
myself
but
it
was
already
too
late
he
looked
at
me
squarely
in
the
face
to
where
he
said
with
good
humor
i
did
not
answer
to
where
he
repeated
and
as
i
remained
strangled
in
my
muteness
to
wadi
tarhit
do
you
mean
it
was
on
the
east
bank
of
wadi
tarhit
a
hundred
and
twenty
kilometers
from
timissao
at
degrees
north
latitude
according
to
the
official
report
that
captain
morhange
was
buried
andré
i
cried
stupidly
i
swear
to
you
what
do
you
swear
to
me
that
i
never
meant
to
speak
of
wadi
tarhit
why
why
should
you
not
speak
to
me
of
wadi
tarhit
in
answer
to
my
supplicating
silence
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
idiot
was
all
he
said
and
he
left
me
before
i
could
think
of
even
one
word
to
say
so
much
humility
on
my
part
had
however
not
disarmed
him
i
had
the
proof
of
it
the
next
day
and
the
way
he
showed
his
humor
was
even
marked
by
an
exhibition
of
wretchedly
poor
taste
i
was
just
out
of
bed
when
he
came
into
my
room
can
you
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
demanded
he
had
in
his
hand
one
of
the
official
registers
in
his
nervous
crises
he
always
began
sorting
them
over
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
pretext
for
making
himself
militarily
insupportable
this
time
chance
had
favored
him
he
opened
the
register
i
blushed
violently
at
seeing
the
poor
proof
of
a
photograph
that
i
knew
well
what
is
that
he
repeated
disdainfully
too
often
i
had
surprised
him
in
the
act
of
regarding
none
too
kindly
the
portrait
of
mlle
de
which
hung
in
my
room
not
to
be
convinced
at
that
moment
that
he
was
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
i
controlled
myself
however
and
placed
the
poor
little
print
in
the
drawer
but
my
calmness
did
not
pacify
him
henceforth
he
said
take
care
i
beg
you
not
to
mix
mementoes
of
your
gallantry
with
the
official
papers
he
added
with
a
smile
that
spoke
insult
it
is
necessary
to
furnish
objects
of
excitation
to
gourrut
andré
i
said
and
i
was
white
i
demand
he
stood
up
to
the
full
height
of
his
stature
well
what
is
it
a
gallantry
nothing
more
i
have
authorized
you
to
speak
of
wadi
halfa
have
i
then
i
have
the
right
i
should
think
andré
now
he
was
looking
maliciously
at
the
wall
at
the
little
portrait
the
replica
of
which
i
had
just
subjected
to
this
painful
scene
there
there
i
say
you
are
angry
are
you
but
between
ourselves
you
will
admit
will
you
not
that
she
is
a
little
thin
and
before
i
could
find
time
to
answer
him
he
had
removed
himself
humming
the
shameful
refrain
of
the
previous
night
la
bastille
a
la
bastille
on
aime
bien
on
aime
bien
nini
peau
de
for
three
days
neither
of
us
spoke
to
the
other
my
exasperation
was
too
deep
for
words
was
i
then
to
be
held
responsible
for
his
avatars
was
it
my
fault
if
between
two
phrases
one
seemed
always
some
allusion
the
situation
is
intolerable
i
said
to
myself
it
can
not
last
longer
it
was
to
cease
very
soon
one
week
after
the
scene
of
the
photograph
the
courier
arrived
i
had
scarcely
glanced
at
the
index
of
the
the
german
review
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
when
i
started
with
uncontrollable
amazement
i
had
just
read
reise
und
entdeckungen
zwei
fronzosischer
offiziere
rittmeisters
morhange
und
oberleutnants
de
in
westlichen
sahara
at
the
same
time
i
heard
my
comrade
voice
anything
interesting
in
this
number
no
i
answered
carelessly
let
see
i
obeyed
what
else
was
there
to
do
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
grew
paler
as
he
ran
over
the
index
however
his
tone
was
altogether
natural
when
he
said
you
will
let
me
borrow
it
of
course
and
he
went
out
casting
me
one
defiant
glance
the
day
passed
slowly
i
did
not
see
him
again
until
evening
he
was
gay
very
gay
and
his
gaiety
hurt
me
when
we
had
finished
dinner
we
went
out
and
leaned
on
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
from
there
out
swept
the
desert
which
the
darkness
was
already
encroaching
upon
from
the
east
andré
broke
the
silence
by
the
way
i
have
returned
your
review
to
you
you
were
right
it
is
not
interesting
his
expression
was
one
of
supreme
amusement
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
with
you
anyway
nothing
i
answered
my
throat
aching
nothing
shall
i
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
supplication
idiot
he
found
it
necessary
to
repeat
once
more
night
fell
quickly
only
the
southern
slope
of
wadi
mia
was
still
yellow
among
the
boulders
a
little
jackal
was
running
about
yapping
sharply
the
is
making
a
fuss
about
nothing
bad
business
said
he
continued
pitilessly
then
you
are
willing
to
say
anything
i
made
a
great
effort
to
produce
the
following
pitiful
phrase
what
an
exhausting
day
what
a
night
heavy
heavy
you
do
feel
like
yourself
you
do
know
any
more
yes
said
the
voice
of
as
from
a
distance
a
heavy
heavy
night
as
heavy
do
you
know
as
when
i
killed
captain
morhange
iii
the
mission
so
i
killed
captain
morhange
andré
de
said
to
me
the
next
day
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
place
with
a
calm
that
took
no
account
of
the
night
the
frightful
night
i
had
just
been
through
why
do
i
tell
you
this
i
do
know
in
the
least
because
of
the
desert
perhaps
are
you
a
man
capable
of
enduring
the
weight
of
that
confidence
and
further
if
necessary
of
assuming
the
consequences
it
may
bring
i
do
know
that
either
the
future
will
decide
for
the
present
there
is
only
one
thing
certain
the
fact
i
tell
you
again
that
i
killed
captain
morhange
i
killed
him
and
since
you
want
me
to
specify
the
reason
you
understand
that
i
am
not
going
to
torture
my
brain
to
turn
it
into
a
romance
for
you
or
commence
by
recounting
in
the
naturalistic
manner
of
what
stuff
my
first
trousers
were
made
or
as
the
would
have
it
how
often
i
went
as
a
child
to
confession
and
how
much
i
liked
doing
it
i
have
no
taste
for
useless
exhibitions
you
will
find
that
this
recital
begins
strictly
at
the
time
when
i
met
morhange
and
first
of
all
i
tell
you
however
much
it
has
cost
my
peace
of
mind
and
my
reputation
i
do
not
regret
having
known
him
in
a
word
apart
from
all
question
of
false
friendship
i
am
convicted
of
a
black
ingratitude
in
having
killed
him
it
is
to
him
it
is
to
his
knowledge
of
rock
inscriptions
that
i
owe
the
only
thing
that
has
raised
my
life
in
interest
above
the
miserable
little
lives
dragged
out
by
my
companions
at
auxonne
and
elsewhere
this
being
understood
here
are
the
facts
note
from
this
point
on
begins
an
extended
narrative
indeed
it
may
be
most
of
the
remaining
book
i
was
changing
the
quoting
until
i
reached
the
end
of
the
chapter
and
found
that
it
continued
on
from
there
it
was
in
the
arabian
office
at
wargla
when
i
was
a
lieutenant
that
i
first
heard
the
name
morhange
and
i
must
add
that
it
was
for
me
the
occasion
of
an
attack
of
bad
humor
we
were
having
difficult
times
the
hostility
of
the
sultan
of
morocco
was
latent
at
touat
where
the
assassination
of
flatters
and
of
frescaly
had
already
been
concocted
connivance
was
being
given
to
the
plots
of
our
enemies
touat
was
the
center
of
conspiracies
of
razzias
of
defections
and
at
the
same
time
the
depot
of
supply
for
the
insatiable
nomads
the
governors
of
algeria
tirman
cambon
laferriere
demanded
its
occupation
the
ministers
of
war
tacitly
agreed
but
there
was
parliament
which
did
nothing
at
all
because
of
england
because
of
germany
and
above
all
because
of
a
certain
of
the
rights
of
man
and
of
the
which
prescribed
that
insurrection
is
the
most
sacred
of
duties
even
when
the
insurgents
are
savages
who
cut
your
head
off
in
short
the
military
authority
could
only
at
its
own
discretion
increase
the
southern
garrisons
and
establish
new
posts
this
one
berresof
fort
macmahon
fort
lallemand
fort
miribel
but
as
castries
puts
it
you
do
hold
the
nomads
with
bordjs
you
hold
them
by
the
belt
the
middle
was
the
oasis
of
touat
their
honors
the
lawyers
of
paris
had
to
be
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
taking
possession
of
the
oasis
of
touat
the
best
way
would
be
to
present
them
with
a
faithful
picture
of
the
plots
that
were
being
woven
there
against
us
the
principal
authors
were
and
still
are
the
senoussis
whose
able
chief
has
been
forced
by
our
arms
to
transfer
the
seat
of
his
confederation
several
thousand
leagues
from
there
to
schimmedrou
in
the
tibesti
they
had
i
say
through
modesty
the
idea
of
ascertaining
the
traces
left
by
these
agitators
on
their
favorite
places
of
concourse
rhât
temassinin
the
plain
of
adejamor
and
it
was
you
see
at
least
after
leaving
temassinin
practically
the
same
itinerary
as
that
followed
in
by
general
rohlfs
i
had
already
attracted
some
attention
by
two
excursions
one
to
agadès
and
the
other
to
bilma
and
was
considered
by
the
staff
officers
to
be
one
of
the
best
informed
on
the
senoussis
question
i
was
therefore
selected
to
assume
this
new
task
i
then
suggested
that
it
would
be
of
interest
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
to
get
in
passing
an
idea
of
the
northern
ahaggar
so
as
to
make
sure
whether
the
tuaregs
of
ahitarhen
had
continued
to
have
as
cordial
relations
with
the
senoussis
as
they
had
had
when
they
combined
to
massacre
the
flatters
mission
i
was
immediately
accorded
the
permission
the
change
in
my
first
plan
was
as
follows
after
reaching
ighelaschem
six
hundred
kilometers
south
of
temassinin
instead
of
taking
the
direct
road
to
touat
via
rhât
i
would
penetrating
between
the
high
land
of
mouydir
and
ahaggar
strike
off
to
the
southwest
as
far
as
here
i
would
turn
again
northwards
towards
by
the
road
to
the
soudan
and
agadès
in
all
hardly
eight
kilometers
additional
in
a
trip
of
about
seven
hundred
leagues
with
the
certainty
of
making
as
complete
an
examination
as
possible
of
the
roads
which
our
enemies
the
senoussis
of
tibesti
and
the
tuareg
of
the
ahaggar
must
follow
to
arrive
at
touat
on
the
way
for
every
explorer
has
his
pet
fancy
i
was
not
at
all
displeased
to
think
that
i
would
have
a
chance
to
examine
the
geological
formation
of
the
plateau
of
egere
about
which
duveyrier
and
the
others
are
so
disappointingly
indefinite
everything
was
ready
for
my
departure
from
wargla
everything
which
is
to
say
very
little
three
mehara
mine
my
companion
a
faithful
chaamba
whom
i
had
had
with
me
in
my
wanderings
through
the
air
less
of
a
guide
in
the
country
i
was
familiar
with
than
a
machine
for
saddling
and
unsaddling
camels
then
a
third
to
carry
provisions
and
skins
of
drinking
water
very
little
since
i
had
taken
pains
to
locate
the
stops
with
reference
to
the
wells
some
people
go
equipped
for
this
kind
of
expedition
with
a
hundred
regulars
and
even
cannon
i
am
for
the
tradition
of
douls
and
rené
callie
i
go
alone
i
was
at
that
perfect
moment
when
only
one
thin
thread
still
held
me
to
the
civilized
world
when
an
official
cable
arrived
at
wargla
lieutenant
de
it
said
briefly
will
delay
his
departure
until
the
arrival
of
captain
morhange
who
will
accompany
him
on
his
expedition
of
exploration
i
was
more
than
disappointed
i
alone
had
had
the
idea
of
this
expedition
i
had
had
all
the
difficulty
that
you
can
imagine
to
make
the
authorities
agree
to
it
and
now
when
i
was
rejoicing
at
the
idea
of
the
long
hours
i
would
spend
alone
with
myself
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
they
sent
me
a
stranger
and
to
make
matters
worse
a
superior
the
condolences
of
my
comrades
aggravated
my
bad
humor
the
yearly
report
consulted
on
the
spot
had
given
them
the
following
information
morhange
class
of
breveted
captain
unassigned
topographical
service
of
the
army
there
is
the
explanation
for
you
said
one
they
are
sending
one
of
their
creatures
to
pull
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
after
you
have
had
all
the
trouble
of
making
it
breveted
that
a
great
way
the
theories
of
ardant
du
picq
or
else
nothing
about
here
i
do
altogether
agree
with
you
said
the
major
they
knew
in
parliament
for
some
one
is
always
indiscreet
the
real
aim
of
mission
to
force
their
hand
for
the
occupation
of
touat
and
this
morhange
must
be
a
man
serving
the
interests
of
the
army
commission
all
these
people
secretaries
members
of
parliament
governors
keep
a
close
watch
on
each
other
some
one
will
write
an
amusing
paradoxical
history
some
day
of
the
french
colonial
expansion
which
is
made
without
the
knowledge
of
the
powers
in
office
when
it
is
not
actually
in
spite
of
them
whatever
the
reason
the
result
will
be
the
same
i
said
bitterly
we
will
be
two
frenchmen
to
spy
on
each
other
night
and
day
along
the
roads
to
the
south
an
amiable
prospect
when
one
has
none
too
much
time
to
foil
all
the
tricks
of
the
natives
when
does
he
arrive
day
after
tomorrow
probably
i
have
news
of
a
convoy
coming
from
ghardaia
it
is
likely
that
he
will
avail
himself
of
it
the
indications
are
that
he
does
know
very
much
about
traveling
alone
captain
morhange
did
arrive
in
fact
two
days
later
by
means
of
the
convoy
from
ghardaia
i
was
the
first
person
for
whom
he
asked
when
he
came
to
my
room
whither
i
had
withdrawn
in
dignity
as
soon
as
the
convoy
was
sighted
i
was
disagreeably
surprised
to
foresee
that
i
would
have
great
difficulty
in
preserving
my
prejudice
against
him
he
was
tall
his
face
full
and
ruddy
with
laughing
blue
eyes
a
small
black
moustache
and
hair
that
was
already
white
i
have
a
thousand
apologies
to
make
to
you
my
dear
fellow
he
said
immediately
with
a
frankness
that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
man
you
must
be
furious
with
my
importunity
in
upsetting
your
plans
and
delaying
your
departure
by
no
means
captain
i
replied
coolly
you
really
have
only
yourself
to
blame
it
is
on
account
of
your
knowledge
of
the
southern
routes
so
highly
esteemed
at
paris
that
i
wished
to
have
you
to
initiate
me
when
the
ministries
of
instruction
and
of
commerce
and
the
geographical
society
combined
to
charge
me
with
the
mission
which
brings
me
here
these
three
honorable
institutions
have
in
fact
entrusted
me
with
the
attempt
to
the
ancient
track
of
the
caravans
which
from
the
ninth
century
trafficked
between
tunis
and
the
soudan
by
toweur
wargla
and
the
bend
of
the
bourroum
and
to
study
the
possibility
of
restoring
this
route
to
its
ancient
splendor
at
the
same
time
at
the
geographic
bureau
i
heard
of
the
journey
that
you
are
undertaking
from
wargla
to
our
two
itineraries
are
the
same
only
i
must
admit
to
you
that
it
is
the
first
voyage
of
this
kind
that
i
have
ever
undertaken
i
would
not
be
afraid
to
hold
forth
for
an
hour
on
arabian
literature
in
the
amphitheatre
of
the
school
of
oriental
languages
but
i
know
well
enough
that
in
the
desert
i
should
have
to
ask
for
directions
whether
to
turn
right
or
left
this
is
the
only
chance
which
could
give
me
such
an
opportunity
and
at
the
same
time
put
me
under
obligation
for
this
introduction
to
so
charming
a
companion
you
must
not
blame
me
if
i
seized
it
if
i
used
all
my
influence
to
retard
your
departure
from
wargla
until
the
instant
when
i
could
join
you
i
have
only
one
more
word
to
add
to
what
i
have
said
i
am
entrusted
with
a
mission
which
by
its
origin
is
rendered
essentially
civilian
you
are
sent
out
by
the
ministry
of
war
up
to
the
moment
when
arrived
at
we
turn
our
backs
on
each
other
to
attain
you
touat
and
i
the
niger
all
your
recommendations
all
your
orders
will
be
followed
by
a
subaltern
and
i
hope
by
a
friend
as
well
all
the
time
he
was
talking
so
openly
i
felt
delightedly
my
worst
recent
fears
melting
away
nevertheless
i
still
experienced
a
mean
desire
to
show
him
some
marks
of
reserve
for
having
thus
disposed
of
my
company
at
a
distance
without
consulting
me
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
captain
for
your
extremely
flattering
words
when
do
you
wish
to
leave
wargla
he
made
a
gesture
of
complete
detachment
whenever
you
like
tomorrow
this
evening
i
have
already
delayed
you
your
preparations
must
have
already
been
made
for
some
time
my
little
maneuver
had
turned
against
myself
i
had
not
been
counting
on
leaving
before
the
next
week
tomorrow
captain
but
your
luggage
he
smiled
delightfully
i
thought
it
best
to
bring
as
little
as
possible
a
light
pack
some
papers
my
brave
camel
had
no
difficulty
in
bringing
it
along
for
the
rest
i
depend
on
your
advice
and
the
resources
of
owargla
i
was
well
caught
i
had
nothing
further
to
say
and
moreover
such
freedom
of
spirit
and
manner
had
already
captivated
me
it
seems
said
my
comrades
when
the
time
for
aperitives
had
brought
us
all
together
again
that
this
captain
of
yours
is
a
remarkably
charming
fellow
remarkably
you
surely
ca
have
any
trouble
with
him
it
is
only
up
to
you
to
see
that
later
on
he
does
get
all
the
glory
we
are
working
with
the
same
end
in
view
i
answered
evasively
i
was
thoughtful
only
thoughtful
i
give
you
my
word
from
that
moment
i
harbored
no
further
grudge
against
morhange
yet
my
silence
persuaded
him
that
i
was
unforgiving
and
everyone
do
you
hear
me
everyone
said
later
on
when
suspicions
became
rife
he
is
surely
guilty
we
saw
them
go
off
together
we
can
affirm
it
i
am
guilty
but
for
a
low
motive
of
jealousy
how
sickening
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
flee
flee
as
far
as
the
places
where
there
are
no
more
men
who
think
and
reason
morhange
appeared
his
arm
resting
on
the
major
who
was
beaming
over
this
new
acquaintanceship
he
presented
him
enthusiastically
captain
morhange
gentlemen
an
officer
of
the
old
school
and
a
man
after
our
own
hearts
i
give
you
my
word
he
wants
to
leave
tomorrow
but
we
must
give
him
such
a
reception
that
he
will
forget
that
idea
before
two
days
are
up
come
captain
you
have
at
least
eight
days
to
give
us
i
am
at
the
disposition
of
lieutenant
de
replied
morhange
with
a
quiet
smile
the
conversation
became
general
the
sound
of
glasses
and
laughter
rang
out
i
heard
my
comrades
in
ecstasies
over
the
stories
that
the
newcomer
poured
out
with
humor
and
i
never
never
have
i
felt
so
sad
the
time
came
to
pass
into
the
at
my
right
captain
cried
the
major
more
and
more
beaming
and
i
hope
you
will
keep
on
giving
us
these
new
lines
on
paris
we
are
not
up
with
the
times
here
you
know
yours
to
command
major
said
morhange
be
seated
gentlemen
the
officers
obeyed
with
a
joyous
clatter
of
moving
chairs
i
had
not
taken
my
eyes
off
morhange
who
was
still
standing
major
gentlemen
you
will
allow
me
he
said
and
before
sitting
down
at
that
table
where
every
moment
he
was
the
life
of
the
party
in
a
low
voice
with
his
eyes
closed
captain
morhange
recited
the
benedicite
iv
towards
latitude
you
see
said
captain
morhange
to
me
fifteen
days
later
you
are
much
better
informed
about
the
ancient
routes
through
the
sahara
than
you
have
been
willing
to
let
me
suppose
since
you
know
of
the
existence
of
the
two
tadekkas
but
the
one
of
which
you
have
just
spoken
is
the
tadekka
of
located
by
this
historian
seventy
days
from
touat
and
placed
by
schirmer
very
plausibly
in
the
unexplored
territory
of
the
aouelimmiden
this
is
the
tadekka
by
which
the
sonrhaï
caravans
passed
every
year
travelling
by
egypt
my
tadekka
is
different
the
capital
of
the
veiled
people
placed
by
twenty
days
south
of
wargla
which
he
calls
tadmekka
it
is
towards
this
tadmekka
that
i
am
headed
i
must
establish
tadmekka
in
the
ruins
of
the
commercial
trade
route
which
in
the
ninth
century
bound
the
tunisian
djerid
to
the
bend
the
niger
makes
at
bourroum
passed
by
it
is
to
study
the
possibility
of
reestablishing
this
ancient
thoroughfare
that
the
ministries
gave
me
this
mission
which
has
given
me
the
pleasure
of
your
companionship
you
are
probably
in
for
a
disappointment
i
said
everything
indicates
that
the
commerce
there
is
very
slight
well
i
shall
see
he
answered
composedly
this
was
while
we
were
following
the
unicolored
banks
of
a
salt
lake
the
great
saline
stretch
shone
under
the
rising
sun
the
legs
of
our
five
mehara
cast
on
it
their
moving
shadows
of
a
darker
blue
for
a
moment
the
only
inhabitant
of
these
solitudes
a
bird
a
kind
of
indeterminate
heron
rose
and
hung
in
the
air
as
if
suspended
from
a
thread
only
to
sink
back
to
rest
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
i
led
the
way
selecting
the
route
morhange
followed
enveloped
in
a
bernous
his
head
covered
with
the
straight
of
the
spahis
a
great
chaplet
of
alternate
red
and
white
beads
ending
in
a
cross
around
his
neck
he
realized
perfectly
the
ideal
of
father
white
fathers
after
a
halt
at
temassinin
we
had
just
left
the
road
followed
by
flatters
and
taken
an
oblique
course
to
the
south
i
have
the
honor
of
having
antedated
fourcau
in
demonstrating
the
importance
of
temassinin
as
a
geometrical
point
for
the
passage
of
caravans
and
of
selecting
the
place
where
captain
pein
has
just
now
constructed
a
fort
the
junction
for
the
roads
that
lead
to
touat
from
fezzan
and
tibesti
temassinin
is
the
future
seat
of
a
marvellous
intelligence
department
what
i
had
collected
there
in
two
days
about
the
disposition
of
our
senoussis
enemies
was
of
importance
i
noticed
that
morhange
let
me
proceed
with
my
inquiries
with
complete
indifference
these
two
days
he
had
passed
in
conversation
with
the
old
negro
guardian
of
the
turbet
which
preserves
under
its
plaster
dome
the
remains
of
the
venerated
the
confidences
they
exchanged
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
forgotten
but
from
the
negro
amazed
admiration
i
realized
the
ignorance
in
which
i
stood
to
the
mysteries
of
the
desert
and
how
familiar
they
were
to
my
companion
and
if
you
want
to
get
any
idea
of
the
extraordinary
originality
which
morhange
introduced
into
such
surroundings
you
who
after
all
have
a
certain
familiarity
with
the
tropics
listen
to
this
it
was
exactly
two
hundred
kilometers
from
here
in
the
vicinity
of
the
great
dune
in
that
horrible
stretch
of
six
days
without
water
we
had
just
enough
for
two
days
before
reaching
the
next
well
and
you
know
these
wells
as
flatters
wrote
to
his
wife
you
have
to
work
for
hours
before
you
can
clean
them
out
and
succeed
in
watering
beasts
and
men
by
chance
we
met
a
caravan
there
which
was
going
east
towards
rhadamès
and
had
come
too
far
north
the
camels
humps
shrunken
and
shaking
bespoke
the
sufferings
of
the
troop
behind
came
a
little
gray
ass
a
pitiful
burrow
interfering
at
every
step
and
lightened
of
its
pack
because
the
merchants
knew
that
it
was
going
to
die
instinctively
with
its
last
strength
it
followed
knowing
that
when
it
could
stagger
no
longer
the
end
would
come
and
the
flutter
of
the
bald
wings
i
love
animals
which
i
have
solid
reasons
for
preferring
to
men
but
never
should
i
have
thought
of
doing
what
morhange
did
then
i
tell
you
that
our
water
skins
were
almost
dry
and
that
our
own
camels
without
which
one
is
lost
in
the
empty
desert
had
not
been
watered
for
many
hours
morhange
made
his
kneel
uncocked
a
skin
and
made
the
little
ass
drink
i
certainly
felt
gratification
at
seeing
the
poor
bare
flanks
of
the
miserable
beast
pant
with
satisfaction
but
the
responsibility
was
mine
also
i
had
seen
aghast
expression
and
the
disapproval
of
the
thirsty
members
of
the
caravan
i
remarked
on
it
how
it
was
received
what
have
i
given
replied
morhange
was
my
own
we
will
reach
evening
about
six
between
here
and
there
i
know
that
i
shall
not
be
thirsty
and
that
in
a
tone
in
which
for
the
first
time
he
allowed
the
authority
of
a
captain
to
speak
that
is
easy
to
say
i
thought
he
knows
that
when
he
wants
them
my
and
are
at
his
service
but
i
did
not
yet
know
morhange
very
well
and
it
is
true
that
until
the
evening
of
the
next
day
when
we
reached
refusing
our
offers
with
smiling
determination
he
drank
nothing
shades
of
francis
of
assisi
umbrian
hills
so
pure
under
the
rising
sun
it
was
in
the
light
of
a
like
sunrise
by
the
border
of
a
pale
stream
leaping
in
full
cascades
from
a
niche
of
the
gray
rocks
of
egere
that
morhange
stopped
the
unlooked
for
waters
rolled
upon
the
sand
and
we
saw
in
the
light
which
mirrored
them
little
black
fish
fish
in
the
middle
of
the
sahara
all
three
of
us
were
mute
before
this
paradox
of
nature
one
of
them
had
strayed
into
a
little
channel
of
sand
he
had
to
stay
there
struggling
in
vain
his
little
white
belly
exposed
to
the
air
morhange
picked
him
up
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
put
him
back
into
the
little
stream
shades
of
francis
umbrian
hills
but
i
have
sworn
not
to
break
the
thread
of
the
story
by
these
untimely
digressions
you
see
captain
morhange
said
to
me
a
week
later
that
i
was
right
in
advising
you
to
go
farther
south
before
making
for
something
told
me
that
this
highland
of
egere
was
not
interesting
from
your
point
of
view
while
here
you
have
only
to
stoop
to
pick
up
pebbles
which
will
allow
you
to
establish
the
volcanic
origin
of
this
region
much
more
certainly
than
des
cloizeaux
and
doctor
marrés
have
done
this
was
while
we
were
following
the
western
pass
of
the
tidifest
mountains
about
the
degree
of
northern
latitude
i
should
indeed
be
ungrateful
not
to
thank
you
i
said
i
shall
always
remember
that
instant
we
had
left
our
camels
and
were
collecting
fragments
of
the
most
characteristic
rocks
morhange
employed
himself
with
a
discernment
which
spoke
worlds
for
his
knowledge
of
geology
a
science
he
had
often
professed
complete
ignorance
of
then
i
asked
him
the
following
question
may
i
prove
my
gratitude
by
making
you
a
confession
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
me
well
then
i
do
see
the
practical
value
of
this
trip
you
have
undertaken
he
smiled
why
not
to
explore
the
old
caravan
route
to
demonstrate
that
a
connection
has
existed
from
the
most
ancient
times
between
the
mediterranean
world
and
the
country
of
the
blacks
that
seems
nothing
in
your
eyes
the
hope
of
settling
once
for
all
the
secular
disputes
which
have
divided
so
many
keen
minds

you
think
that
that
is
devoid
of
interest
a
plague
upon
you
for
being
hard
to
please
i
spoke
of
practical
value
i
said
you
wo
deny
that
this
controversy
is
only
the
affair
of
cabinet
geographers
and
office
explorers
morhange
kept
on
smiling
dear
friend
do
wither
me
deign
to
recall
that
your
mission
was
confided
to
you
by
the
ministry
of
war
while
i
hold
mine
on
behalf
of
the
ministry
of
public
instruction
a
different
origin
justifies
our
different
aims
it
certainly
explains
i
readily
concede
that
to
you
why
what
i
am
in
search
of
has
no
practical
value
you
are
also
authorized
by
the
ministry
of
commerce
i
replied
playing
my
next
card
by
this
chief
you
are
instructed
to
study
the
possibility
of
restoring
the
old
trade
route
of
the
ninth
century
but
on
this
point
do
attempt
to
mislead
me
with
your
knowledge
of
the
history
and
geography
of
the
sahara
your
mind
must
have
been
made
up
before
you
left
paris
the
road
from
djerid
to
the
niger
is
dead
stone
dead
you
knew
that
no
important
traffic
would
pass
by
this
route
before
you
undertook
to
study
the
possibility
of
restoring
it
morhange
looked
me
full
in
the
face
and
if
that
should
be
so
he
said
with
the
most
charming
attitude
if
i
had
before
leaving
the
conviction
you
say
what
do
you
conclude
from
that
i
should
prefer
to
have
you
tell
me
simply
my
dear
boy
that
i
had
less
skill
than
you
in
finding
the
pretext
for
my
voyage
that
i
furnished
less
good
reasons
for
the
true
motives
that
brought
me
here
a
pretext
i
do
see
be
sincere
in
your
turn
if
you
please
i
am
sure
that
you
have
the
greatest
desire
to
inform
the
arabian
office
about
the
practices
of
the
senoussis
but
admit
that
the
information
that
you
will
obtain
is
not
the
sole
and
innermost
aim
of
your
excursion
you
are
a
geologist
my
friend
you
have
found
a
chance
to
gratify
your
taste
in
this
trip
no
one
would
think
of
blaming
you
because
you
have
known
how
to
reconcile
what
is
useful
to
your
country
and
agreeable
to
yourself
but
for
the
love
of
god
do
deny
it
i
need
no
other
proof
than
your
presence
here
on
this
side
of
the
tidifest
a
very
curious
place
from
a
mineralogical
point
of
view
but
some
hundred
and
fifty
kilometers
south
of
your
official
route
it
was
not
possible
to
have
countered
me
with
a
better
grace
i
parried
by
attacking
am
i
to
conclude
from
all
this
that
i
do
not
know
the
real
aims
of
your
trip
and
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
official
motives
i
had
gone
a
bit
too
far
i
felt
it
from
the
seriousness
with
which
morhange
reply
was
delivered
no
my
dear
friend
you
must
not
conclude
just
that
i
should
have
no
taste
for
a
lie
which
was
based
on
fraud
towards
the
estimable
constitutional
bodies
which
have
judged
me
worthy
of
their
confidence
and
their
support
the
ends
that
they
have
assigned
to
me
i
shall
do
my
best
to
attain
but
i
have
no
reason
for
hiding
from
you
that
there
is
another
quite
personal
which
is
far
nearer
to
my
heart
let
us
say
if
you
will
to
use
a
terminology
that
is
otherwise
deplorable
that
this
is
the
end
while
the
others
are
the
means
would
there
be
any
indiscretion
none
replied
my
companion
is
only
a
few
days
distant
he
whose
first
steps
you
have
guided
with
such
solicitude
in
the
desert
should
have
nothing
hidden
from
you
we
had
halted
in
the
valley
of
a
little
dry
well
where
a
few
sickly
plants
were
growing
a
spring
near
by
was
circled
by
a
crown
of
gray
verdure
the
camels
had
been
unsaddled
for
the
night
and
were
seeking
vainly
at
every
stride
to
nibble
the
spiny
tufts
of
the
black
and
polished
sides
of
the
tidifest
mountains
rose
almost
vertically
above
our
heads
already
the
blue
smoke
of
the
fire
on
which
was
cooking
dinner
rose
through
the
motionless
air
not
a
sound
not
a
breath
the
smoke
mounted
straight
straight
and
slowly
up
the
pale
steps
of
the
firmament
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
of
asked
morhange
i
think
so
is
it
a
geographical
work
published
by
the
benedictines
under
the
direction
of
a
certain
dom
granger
your
memory
is
correct
said
morhange
even
so
let
me
explain
a
little
more
fully
some
of
the
things
you
have
not
had
as
much
reason
as
i
to
interest
yourself
in
the
of
proposes
to
establish
the
boundaries
of
that
great
tide
of
christianity
through
all
the
ages
and
for
all
parts
of
the
globe
an
undertaking
worthy
of
the
benedictine
learning
worthy
of
such
a
prodigy
of
erudition
as
dom
granger
himself
and
it
is
these
boundaries
that
you
have
come
to
determine
here
no
doubt
i
murmured
just
so
replied
my
companion
he
was
silent
and
i
respected
his
silence
prepared
by
now
to
be
astonished
at
nothing
it
is
not
possible
to
give
confidences
by
halves
without
being
ridiculous
he
continued
after
several
minutes
of
meditation
speaking
gravely
in
a
voice
which
held
no
suggestion
of
that
flashing
humor
which
had
a
month
before
enchanted
the
young
officers
at
wargla
i
have
begun
on
mine
i
will
tell
you
everything
trust
my
discretion
however
and
do
not
insist
upon
certain
events
of
my
private
life
if
four
years
ago
at
the
close
of
these
events
i
resolve
to
enter
a
monastery
it
does
not
concern
you
to
know
my
reasons
i
can
marvel
at
it
myself
that
the
passage
in
my
life
of
a
being
absolutely
devoid
of
interest
should
have
sufficed
to
change
the
current
of
that
life
i
can
marvel
that
a
creature
whose
sole
merit
was
her
beauty
should
have
been
permitted
by
the
creator
to
swing
my
destiny
to
such
an
unforeseen
direction
the
monastery
at
whose
doors
i
knocked
had
the
most
valid
reasons
for
doubting
the
stability
of
my
vocation
what
the
world
loses
in
such
fashion
it
often
calls
back
as
readily
in
short
i
can
not
blame
the
father
abbot
for
having
forbidden
me
to
apply
for
my
army
discharge
by
his
instructions
i
asked
for
and
obtained
permission
to
be
placed
on
the
inactive
list
for
three
years
at
the
end
of
those
three
years
of
consecration
it
would
be
seen
whether
the
world
was
definitely
dead
to
your
servant
the
first
day
of
my
arrival
at
the
cloister
i
was
assigned
to
dom
granger
and
placed
by
him
at
work
on
the
of
a
brief
examination
decided
him
as
to
what
kind
of
service
i
was
best
fitted
to
render
this
is
how
i
came
to
enter
the
studio
devoted
to
the
cartography
of
northern
africa
i
did
not
know
one
word
of
arabic
but
it
happened
that
in
garrison
at
lyon
i
had
taken
at
the
des
lettres
a
course
with
berlioux
a
very
erudite
geographer
no
doubt
but
obsessed
by
one
idea
the
influence
the
greek
and
roman
civilizations
had
exercised
on
africa
this
detail
of
my
life
was
enough
for
dom
granger
he
provided
me
straightway
with
berber
vocabularies
by
venture
by
delaporte
by
brosselard
with
the
sketch
of
the
by
stanley
fleeman
and
the
de
grammaire
de
la
langue
by
major
hanoteau
at
the
end
of
three
months
i
was
able
to
decipher
any
inscriptions
in
tifinar
you
know
that
tifinar
is
the
national
writing
of
the
tuareg
the
expression
of
this
temachek
language
which
seems
to
us
the
most
curious
protest
of
the
targui
race
against
its
mohammedan
enemies
dom
granger
in
fact
believed
that
the
tuareg
are
christians
dating
from
a
period
which
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
but
which
coincided
no
doubt
with
the
splendor
of
the
church
of
hippon
even
better
than
i
you
know
that
the
cross
is
with
them
the
symbol
of
fate
in
decoration
duveyrier
has
claimed
that
it
figures
in
their
alphabet
on
their
arms
among
the
designs
of
their
clothes
the
only
tattooing
that
they
wear
on
the
forehead
on
the
back
of
the
hand
is
a
cross
with
four
equal
branches
the
pummels
of
their
saddles
the
handles
of
their
sabres
of
their
poignards
are
and
is
it
necessary
to
remind
you
that
although
islam
forbids
bells
as
a
sign
of
christianity
the
harness
of
tuareg
camels
are
trimmed
with
bells
neither
dom
granger
nor
i
attach
an
exaggerated
importance
to
such
proofs
which
resemble
too
much
those
which
make
such
a
display
in
the
of
but
it
is
indeed
impossible
to
refuse
all
credence
to
certain
theological
arguments
amanai
the
god
of
the
tuareg
unquestionably
the
adonai
of
the
bible
is
unique
they
have
a
hell
the
last
fire
where
reigns
iblis
our
lucifer
their
paradise
where
they
are
rewarded
for
good
deeds
is
inhabited
by
our
angels
and
do
not
urge
the
resemblance
of
this
theology
to
the
koran
for
i
will
meet
you
with
historic
arguments
and
remind
you
that
the
tuareg
have
struggled
all
through
the
ages
at
the
cost
of
partial
extermination
to
maintain
their
faith
against
the
encroachments
of
mohammedan
fanaticism
many
times
i
have
studied
with
dom
granger
that
formidable
epoch
when
the
aborigines
opposed
the
conquering
arabs
with
him
i
have
seen
how
the
army
of
one
of
the
companions
of
the
prophet
invaded
this
desert
to
reduce
the
tuareg
tribes
and
impose
on
them
mussulman
rules
these
tribes
were
then
rich
and
prosperous
they
were
the
ihbggaren
the
imededren
the
ouadelen
the
the
but
internal
quarrels
sapped
their
strength
still
it
was
not
until
after
a
long
and
cruel
war
that
the
arabians
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
the
capital
of
the
berbers
which
had
proved
such
a
redoubtable
stronghold
they
destroyed
it
after
they
had
massacred
the
inhabitants
on
the
ruins
okba
constructed
a
new
city
this
city
is
the
one
that
destroyed
was
the
berber
tadmekka
what
dom
granger
asked
of
me
was
precisely
that
i
should
try
to
exhume
from
the
ruins
of
the
mussulman
the
ruins
of
tadmekka
which
was
berber
and
perhaps
christian
i
understand
i
murmured
so
far
so
good
said
morhange
but
what
you
must
grasp
now
is
the
practical
sense
of
these
religious
men
my
masters
you
remember
that
even
after
three
years
of
monastic
life
they
preserved
their
doubts
as
to
the
stability
of
my
vocation
they
found
at
the
same
time
means
of
testing
it
once
for
all
and
of
adapting
official
facilities
to
their
particular
purposes
one
morning
i
was
called
before
the
father
abbot
and
this
is
what
he
said
to
me
in
the
presence
of
dom
granger
who
expressed
silent
approval
term
of
inactive
service
expires
in
fifteen
days
you
will
return
to
paris
and
apply
at
the
ministry
to
be
reinstated
with
what
you
have
learned
here
and
the
relationships
we
have
been
able
to
maintain
at
headquarters
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
being
attached
to
the
geographical
staff
of
the
army
when
you
reach
the
rue
de
grenelle
you
will
receive
our
instructions
i
was
astonished
at
their
confidence
in
my
knowledge
when
i
was
reestablished
as
captain
again
in
the
geographical
service
i
understood
at
the
monastery
the
daily
association
with
dom
granger
and
his
pupils
had
kept
me
constantly
convinced
of
the
inferiority
of
my
knowledge
when
i
came
in
contact
with
my
military
brethren
i
realized
the
superiority
of
the
instruction
i
had
received
i
did
not
have
to
concern
myself
with
the
details
of
my
mission
the
ministries
invited
me
to
undertake
it
my
initiative
asserted
itself
on
only
one
occasion
when
i
learned
that
you
were
going
to
leave
wargla
on
the
present
expedition
having
reason
to
distrust
my
practical
qualifications
as
an
explorer
i
did
my
best
to
retard
your
departure
so
that
i
might
join
you
i
hope
that
you
have
forgiven
me
by
now
the
light
in
the
west
was
fading
where
the
sun
had
already
sunk
into
a
matchless
luxury
of
violet
draperies
we
were
alone
in
this
immensity
at
the
feet
of
the
rigid
black
rocks
nothing
but
ourselves
nothing
nothing
but
ourselves
i
held
out
my
hand
to
morhange
and
he
pressed
it
then
he
said
if
they
still
seem
infinitely
long
to
me
the
several
thousand
kilometers
which
separate
me
from
the
instant
when
my
task
accomplished
i
shall
at
last
find
oblivion
in
the
cloister
for
the
things
for
which
i
was
not
made
let
me
tell
you
this
the
several
hundred
kilometers
which
still
separate
us
from
seem
to
me
infinitely
short
to
traverse
in
your
company
on
the
pale
water
of
the
little
pool
motionless
and
fixed
like
a
silver
nail
a
star
had
just
been
born
i
murmured
my
heart
full
of
an
indefinable
sadness
patience
we
are
not
there
yet
in
truth
we
never
were
to
be
there
v
the
inscription
with
a
blow
of
the
tip
of
his
cane
morhange
knocked
a
fragment
of
rock
from
the
black
flank
of
the
mountain
what
is
it
he
asked
holding
it
out
to
me
a
basaltic
peridot
i
said
it
ca
be
very
interesting
you
barely
glanced
at
it
it
is
very
interesting
on
the
contrary
but
for
the
moment
i
admit
that
i
am
otherwise
preoccupied
how
look
this
way
a
bit
i
said
showing
towards
the
west
on
the
horizon
a
black
spot
across
the
white
plain
it
was
six
in
the
morning
the
sun
had
risen
but
it
could
not
be
found
in
the
surprisingly
polished
air
and
not
a
breath
of
air
not
a
breath
suddenly
one
of
the
camels
called
an
enormous
antelope
had
just
come
in
sight
and
had
stopped
in
its
flight
terrified
racing
the
wall
of
rock
it
stayed
there
at
a
little
distance
from
us
dazed
trembling
on
its
slender
legs
had
rejoined
us
when
the
legs
of
the
mohor
tremble
it
is
because
the
firmament
is
shaken
he
muttered
a
storm
yes
a
storm
and
you
find
that
alarming
i
did
not
answer
immediately
i
was
exchanging
several
brief
words
with
who
was
occupied
in
soothing
the
camels
which
were
giving
signs
of
being
restive
morhange
repeated
his
question
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
alarming
i
do
know
i
have
never
seen
a
storm
on
the
hoggar
but
i
distrust
it
and
the
signs
are
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
big
one
see
there
already
a
slight
dust
had
risen
before
the
cliff
in
the
still
air
a
few
grains
of
sand
had
begun
to
whirl
round
and
round
with
a
speed
which
increased
to
dizziness
giving
us
in
advance
the
spectacle
in
miniature
of
what
would
soon
be
breaking
upon
us
with
harsh
cries
a
flock
of
wild
geese
appeared
flying
low
they
came
out
of
the
west
they
are
fleeing
towards
the
sebkha
said
there
could
be
no
greater
mistake
i
thought
morhange
looked
at
me
curiously
what
must
we
do
he
asked
mount
our
camels
immediately
before
they
are
completely
demoralized
and
hurry
to
find
shelter
in
some
high
places
take
account
of
our
situation
it
is
easy
to
follow
the
bed
of
a
stream
but
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
the
storm
will
have
burst
within
a
half
hour
a
perfect
torrent
will
be
rushing
here
on
this
soil
which
is
almost
impermeable
rain
will
roll
like
a
pail
of
water
thrown
on
a
bituminous
pavement
no
depth
all
height
look
at
this
and
i
showed
him
a
dozen
meters
high
long
hollow
gouges
marks
of
former
erosions
on
the
rocky
wall
in
an
hour
the
waters
will
reach
that
height
those
are
the
marks
of
the
last
inundation
let
us
get
started
there
is
not
an
instant
to
lose
all
right
morhange
replied
tranquilly
we
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
make
the
camels
kneel
when
we
had
thrown
ourselves
into
the
saddle
they
started
off
at
a
pace
which
their
terror
rendered
more
and
more
disorderly
of
a
sudden
the
wind
began
a
formidable
wind
and
almost
at
the
same
time
the
light
was
eclipsed
in
the
ravine
above
our
heads
the
sky
had
become
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
darker
than
the
walls
of
the
canyon
which
we
were
descending
at
a
breathless
pace
a
path
a
stairway
in
the
wall
i
screamed
against
the
wind
to
my
companions
if
we
do
find
one
in
a
minute
we
are
lost
they
did
not
hear
me
but
turning
in
my
saddle
i
saw
that
they
had
lost
no
distance
morhange
following
me
and
in
the
rear
driving
the
two
baggage
camels
masterfully
before
him
a
blinding
streak
of
lightning
rent
the
obscurity
a
peal
of
thunder
to
infinity
by
the
rocky
wall
rang
out
and
immediately
great
tepid
drops
began
to
fall
in
an
instant
our
burnouses
which
had
been
blown
out
behind
by
the
speed
with
which
we
were
traveling
were
stuck
tight
to
our
streaming
bodies
saved
i
exclaimed
suddenly
abruptly
on
our
right
a
crevice
opened
in
the
midst
of
the
wall
it
was
the
almost
perpendicular
bed
of
a
stream
an
affluent
of
the
one
we
had
had
the
unfortunate
idea
of
following
that
morning
already
a
veritable
torrent
was
gushing
over
it
with
a
fine
uproar
i
have
never
better
appreciated
the
incomparable
of
camels
in
the
most
precipitate
places
bracing
themselves
stretching
out
their
great
legs
balancing
themselves
among
the
rocks
that
were
beginning
to
be
swept
loose
our
camels
accomplished
at
that
moment
what
the
mules
of
the
pyrannees
might
have
failed
in
after
several
moments
of
superhuman
effort
we
found
ourselves
at
last
out
of
danger
on
a
kind
of
basaltic
terrace
elevated
some
fifty
meters
above
the
channel
of
the
stream
we
had
just
left
luck
was
with
us
a
little
grotto
opened
out
behind
succeeded
in
sheltering
the
camels
there
from
its
threshold
we
had
leisure
to
contemplate
in
silence
the
prodigious
spectacle
spread
out
before
us
you
have
i
believe
been
at
the
camp
of
chalons
for
artillery
drills
you
have
seen
when
the
shell
bursts
how
the
chalky
soil
of
the
marne
effervesces
like
the
inkwells
at
school
when
we
used
to
throw
a
piece
of
calcium
carbonate
into
them
well
it
was
almost
like
that
but
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
in
the
midst
of
obscurity
the
white
waters
rushed
into
the
depths
of
the
black
hole
and
rose
and
rose
towards
the
pedestal
on
which
we
stood
and
there
was
the
uninterrupted
noise
of
thunder
and
still
louder
the
sound
of
whole
walls
of
rock
undermined
by
the
flood
collapsing
in
a
heap
and
dissolving
in
a
few
seconds
of
time
in
the
midst
of
the
rising
water
all
the
time
that
this
deluge
lasted
one
hour
perhaps
two
morhange
and
i
stayed
bending
over
this
fantastic
foaming
vat
anxious
to
see
to
see
everything
to
see
in
spite
of
everything
rejoicing
with
a
kind
of
ineffable
horror
when
we
felt
the
shelf
of
basalt
on
which
we
had
taken
refuge
swaying
beneath
us
from
the
battering
impact
of
the
water
i
believe
that
never
for
an
instant
did
we
think
so
beautiful
it
was
of
wishing
for
the
end
of
that
gigantic
nightmare
finally
a
ray
of
the
sun
shone
through
only
then
did
we
look
at
each
other
morhange
held
out
his
hand
thank
you
he
said
simply
and
he
added
with
a
smile
to
be
drowned
in
the
very
middle
of
the
sahara
would
have
been
pretentious
and
ridiculous
you
have
saved
us
thanks
to
your
power
of
decision
from
this
very
paradoxical
end
ah
that
he
had
been
thrown
by
a
misstep
of
his
camel
and
rolled
to
his
death
in
the
midst
of
the
flood
then
what
followed
would
never
have
happened
that
is
the
thought
that
comes
to
me
in
hours
of
weakness
but
i
have
told
you
that
i
pull
myself
out
of
it
quickly
no
no
i
do
not
regret
it
i
can
not
regret
it
that
what
happened
did
happen
morhange
left
me
to
go
into
the
little
grotto
where
camels
were
now
resting
comfortably
i
stayed
alone
watching
the
torrent
which
was
continuously
rising
with
the
impetuous
inrush
of
its
unbridled
tributaries
it
had
stopped
raining
the
sun
shone
from
a
sky
that
had
renewed
its
blueness
i
could
feel
the
clothes
that
had
a
moment
before
been
drenching
drying
upon
me
incredibly
fast
a
hand
was
placed
on
my
shoulder
morhange
was
again
beside
me
come
here
he
said
somewhat
surprised
i
followed
him
we
went
into
the
grotto
the
opening
which
was
big
enough
to
admit
the
camels
made
it
fairly
light
morhange
led
me
up
to
the
smooth
face
of
rock
opposite
look
he
said
with
unconcealed
joy
what
of
it
do
you
see
i
see
that
there
are
several
tuareg
inscriptions
i
answered
with
some
disappointment
but
i
thought
i
had
told
you
that
i
read
tifinar
writing
very
badly
are
these
writings
more
interesting
than
the
others
we
have
come
upon
before
look
at
this
one
said
morhange
there
was
such
an
accent
of
triumph
in
his
tone
that
this
time
i
concentrated
my
attention
i
looked
again
the
characters
of
the
inscription
were
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
cross
it
plays
such
an
important
part
in
this
adventure
that
i
can
not
forego
retracing
it
for
you
o
o
o
o
w
transcriber
note
this
is
but
a
crude
ascii
representation
of
the
inscription
the
center
is
rotated
degrees
in
the
book
it
was
designed
with
great
regularity
and
the
characters
were
cut
deep
into
the
rock
although
i
knew
so
little
of
rock
inscriptions
at
that
time
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
antiquity
of
this
one
morhange
became
more
and
more
radiant
as
he
regarded
it
i
looked
at
him
questioningly
well
what
have
you
to
say
now
he
asked
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
i
tell
you
that
i
can
barely
read
tifinar
shall
i
help
you
he
suggested
this
course
in
berber
writing
after
the
emotions
through
which
we
had
just
passed
seemed
to
me
a
little
inopportune
but
morhange
was
so
visibly
delighted
that
i
could
not
dash
his
joy
very
well
then
began
my
companion
as
much
at
his
ease
as
if
he
had
been
before
a
blackboard
what
will
strike
you
first
about
this
inscription
is
its
repetition
in
the
form
of
a
cross
that
is
to
say
that
it
contains
the
same
word
twice
top
to
bottom
and
right
to
left
the
word
which
it
composes
has
seven
letters
so
the
fourth
letter
w
transcriber
note
rotated
deg
comes
naturally
in
the
middle
this
arrangement
which
is
unique
in
tifinar
writing
is
already
remarkable
enough
but
there
is
better
still
now
we
will
read
it
getting
it
wrong
three
times
out
of
seven
i
finally
succeeded
with
morhange
help
in
spelling
the
word
have
you
got
it
asked
morhange
when
i
had
finished
my
task
less
than
ever
i
answered
a
little
put
out
a
n
t
i
n
h
a
antinha
i
do
know
that
word
or
anything
like
it
in
all
the
saharan
dialects
i
am
familiar
with
morhange
rubbed
his
hands
together
his
satisfaction
was
without
bounds
you
have
said
it
that
is
why
the
discovery
is
unique
why
there
is
really
nothing
either
in
berber
or
in
arabian
analogous
to
this
word
then
then
my
dear
friend
we
are
in
the
presence
of
a
foreign
word
translated
into
tifinar
and
this
word
belongs
according
to
your
theory
to
what
language
you
must
realize
that
the
letter
does
not
exist
in
the
tifinar
alphabet
it
has
here
been
replaced
by
the
phonetic
sign
which
is
nearest
to
it
restore
to
the
place
which
belongs
to
it
in
the
word
and
you
have
antinea
precisely
we
find
ourselves
before
a
greek
vocable
reproduced
in
tifinar
and
i
think
that
now
you
will
agree
with
me
that
my
find
has
a
certain
interest
that
day
we
had
no
more
conferences
upon
texts
a
loud
cry
anguished
terrifying
rang
out
we
rushed
out
to
find
a
strange
spectacle
awaiting
us
although
the
sky
had
cleared
again
the
torrent
of
yellow
water
was
still
foaming
and
no
one
could
predict
when
it
would
fall
in
struggling
desperately
in
the
current
was
an
extraordinary
mass
gray
and
soft
and
swaying
but
what
at
the
first
glance
overwhelmed
us
with
astonishment
was
to
see
usually
so
calm
at
this
moment
apparently
beside
himself
with
frenzy
bounding
through
the
gullies
and
over
the
rocks
of
the
ledge
in
full
pursuit
of
the
shipwreck
of
a
sudden
i
seized
morhange
by
the
arm
the
grayish
thing
was
alive
a
pitiful
long
neck
emerged
from
it
with
the
heartrending
cry
of
a
beast
in
despair
the
fool
i
cried
he
has
let
one
of
our
beasts
get
loose
and
the
stream
is
carrying
it
away
you
are
mistaken
said
morhange
our
camels
are
all
in
the
cave
the
one
is
running
after
is
not
ours
and
the
cry
of
anguish
we
just
heard
that
was
not
either
is
a
brave
chaamb
who
has
at
this
moment
only
one
idea
to
appropriate
the
intestate
capital
represented
by
this
camel
in
the
stream
who
gave
that
cry
then
let
us
try
if
you
like
to
explore
up
this
stream
that
our
guide
is
descending
at
such
a
rate
and
without
waiting
for
my
answer
he
had
already
set
out
through
the
recently
washed
gullies
of
the
rocky
bank
at
that
moment
it
can
be
truly
said
that
morhange
went
to
meet
his
destiny
i
followed
him
we
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
proceeding
two
or
three
hundred
meters
finally
we
saw
at
our
feet
a
little
rushing
brook
where
the
water
was
falling
a
trifle
see
there
said
morhange
a
blackish
bundle
was
balancing
on
the
waves
of
the
creek
when
we
had
come
up
even
with
it
we
saw
that
it
was
a
man
in
the
long
dark
blue
robes
of
the
tuareg
give
me
your
hand
said
morhange
and
brace
yourself
against
a
rock
hard
he
was
very
very
strong
in
an
instant
as
if
it
were
child
play
he
had
brought
the
body
ashore
he
is
still
alive
he
pronounced
with
satisfaction
now
it
is
a
question
of
getting
him
to
the
grotto
this
is
no
place
to
resuscitate
a
drowned
man
he
raised
the
body
in
his
powerful
arms
it
is
astonishing
how
little
he
weighs
for
a
man
of
his
height
by
the
time
we
had
retraced
the
way
to
the
grotto
the
man
cotton
clothes
were
almost
dry
but
the
dye
had
run
plentifully
and
it
was
an
indigo
man
that
morhange
was
trying
to
recall
to
life
when
i
had
made
him
swallow
a
quart
of
rum
he
opened
his
eyes
looked
at
the
two
of
us
with
surprise
then
closing
them
again
murmured
almost
unintelligibly
a
phrase
the
sense
of
which
we
did
not
get
until
some
days
later
can
it
be
that
i
have
reached
the
end
of
my
mission
what
mission
is
he
talking
about
i
said
let
him
recover
himself
completely
responded
morhange
you
had
better
open
some
preserved
food
with
fellows
of
this
build
you
have
to
observe
the
precautions
prescribed
for
drowned
europeans
it
was
indeed
a
species
of
giant
whose
life
we
had
just
saved
his
face
although
very
thin
was
regular
almost
beautiful
he
had
a
clear
skin
and
little
beard
his
hair
already
white
showed
him
to
be
a
man
of
sixty
years
when
i
placed
a
tin
of
before
him
a
light
of
voracious
joy
came
into
his
eyes
the
tin
contained
an
allowance
for
four
persons
it
was
empty
in
a
flash
behold
said
morhange
a
robust
appetite
now
we
can
put
our
questions
without
scruple
already
the
targa
had
placed
over
his
forehead
and
face
the
blue
veil
prescribed
by
the
ritual
he
must
have
been
completely
famished
not
to
have
performed
this
indispensable
formality
sooner
there
was
nothing
visible
now
but
the
eyes
watching
us
with
a
light
that
grew
steadily
more
sombre
french
officers
he
murmured
at
last
and
he
took
morhange
hand
and
having
placed
it
against
his
breast
carried
it
to
his
lips
suddenly
an
expression
of
anxiety
passed
over
his
face
and
my
mehari
he
asked
i
explained
that
our
guide
was
then
employed
in
trying
to
save
his
beast
he
in
turn
told
us
how
it
had
stumbled
and
fallen
into
the
current
and
he
himself
in
trying
to
save
it
had
been
knocked
over
his
forehead
had
struck
a
rock
he
had
cried
out
after
that
he
remembered
nothing
more
what
is
your
name
i
asked
what
tribe
do
you
belong
to
the
tribe
of
the
are
the
serfs
of
the
tribe
of
the
great
nobles
of
hoggar
yes
he
answered
casting
a
side
glance
in
my
direction
it
seemed
that
such
precise
questions
on
the
affairs
of
ahygar
were
not
to
his
liking
the
if
i
am
not
mistaken
are
established
on
the
southwest
flank
of
atakor
what
were
you
doing
so
far
from
your
home
territory
when
we
saved
your
life
footnote
another
name
in
the
temahaq
language
for
ahaggar
note
by
m
leroux
i
was
going
by
way
of
tit
to
he
said
what
were
you
going
to
do
at
he
was
about
to
reply
but
suddenly
we
saw
him
tremble
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
point
of
the
cavern
we
looked
to
see
what
it
was
he
had
just
seen
the
rock
inscription
which
had
so
delighted
morhange
an
hour
before
do
you
know
that
morhange
asked
him
with
keen
curiosity
the
targa
did
not
speak
a
word
but
his
eyes
had
a
strange
light
do
you
know
that
insisted
morhange
and
he
added
antinea
antinea
repeated
the
man
and
he
was
silent
why
do
you
answer
the
captain
i
called
out
with
a
strange
feeling
of
rage
sweeping
over
me
the
targui
looked
at
me
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
speak
but
his
eyes
became
suddenly
hard
under
the
lustrous
veil
i
saw
his
features
stiffening
morhange
and
i
turned
around
on
the
threshold
of
the
cavern
breathless
discomfited
harassed
by
an
hour
of
vain
pursuit
had
returned
to
us
vi
the
disaster
of
the
lettuce
as
and
came
face
to
face
i
fancied
that
both
the
targa
and
the
chaamba
gave
a
sudden
start
which
each
immediately
repressed
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
fleeting
impression
nevertheless
it
was
enough
to
make
me
resolve
that
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
with
our
guide
i
would
question
him
closely
concerning
our
new
companion
the
beginning
of
the
day
had
been
wearisome
enough
we
decided
therefore
to
spend
the
rest
of
it
there
and
even
to
pass
the
night
in
the
cave
waiting
till
the
flood
had
completely
subsided
in
the
morning
when
i
was
marking
our
day
march
upon
the
map
morhange
came
toward
me
i
noticed
that
his
manner
was
somewhat
restrained
in
three
days
we
shall
be
at
i
said
to
him
perhaps
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
badly
as
the
camels
go
perhaps
we
shall
separate
before
then
he
muttered
how
so
you
see
i
have
changed
my
itinerary
a
little
i
have
given
up
the
idea
of
going
straight
to
timissao
first
i
should
like
to
make
a
little
excursion
into
the
interior
of
the
ahaggar
range
i
frowned
what
is
this
new
idea
as
i
spoke
i
looked
about
for
whom
i
had
seen
in
conversation
with
morhange
the
previous
evening
and
several
minutes
before
he
was
quietly
mending
one
of
his
sandals
with
a
waxed
thread
supplied
by
he
did
not
raise
his
head
it
is
simply
explained
morhange
less
and
less
at
his
ease
that
this
man
tells
me
there
are
similar
inscriptions
in
several
caverns
in
western
ahaggar
these
caves
are
near
the
road
that
he
has
to
take
returning
home
he
must
pass
by
tit
now
from
tit
by
way
of
silet
is
hardly
two
hundred
kilometers
it
is
a
route
as
short
again
as
the
one
that
i
shall
have
to
take
alone
after
i
leave
you
from
to
timissao
that
is
in
part
you
see
the
reason
which
has
made
me
decide
to
footnote
the
route
and
the
stages
from
tit
to
timissao
were
actually
plotted
out
as
early
as
by
captain
bissuel
tuarge
de
itineraries
and
note
by
m
leroux
in
part
in
very
small
part
i
replied
but
is
your
mind
absolutely
made
up
it
is
he
answered
me
when
do
you
expect
to
leave
me
the
road
which
proposes
to
take
into
ahaggar
crosses
this
one
about
four
leagues
from
here
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
in
this
connection
please
tell
me
it
is
to
let
me
take
one
of
the
two
baggage
camels
since
my
targa
has
lost
his
the
camel
which
carries
your
baggage
belongs
to
you
as
much
as
does
your
own
mehari
i
answered
coldly
we
stood
there
several
minutes
without
speaking
morhange
maintained
an
uneasy
silence
i
was
examining
my
map
all
over
it
in
greater
or
less
degree
but
particularly
towards
the
south
the
unexplored
portions
of
ahaggar
stood
out
as
far
too
numerous
white
patches
in
the
tan
area
of
supposed
mountains
i
finally
said
you
give
me
your
word
that
when
you
have
seen
these
famous
grottos
you
will
make
straight
for
timissao
by
tit
and
silet
he
looked
at
me
uncomprehendingly
why
do
you
ask
that
because
if
you
promise
me
that
provided
of
course
that
my
company
is
not
unwelcome
to
you
i
will
go
with
you
either
way
i
shall
have
two
hundred
kilometers
to
go
i
shall
strike
for
from
the
south
instead
of
from
the
west
that
is
the
only
difference
morhange
looked
at
me
with
emotion
why
do
you
do
this
he
murmured
my
dear
fellow
i
said
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
addressed
morhange
in
this
familiar
way
my
dear
fellow
i
have
a
sense
which
becomes
marvellously
acute
in
the
desert
the
sense
of
danger
i
gave
you
a
slight
proof
of
it
yesterday
morning
at
the
coming
of
the
storm
with
all
your
knowledge
of
rock
inscriptions
you
seem
to
me
to
have
no
very
exact
idea
of
what
kind
of
place
ahaggar
is
nor
what
may
be
in
store
for
you
there
on
that
account
i
should
be
just
as
well
pleased
not
to
let
you
run
sure
risks
alone
i
have
a
guide
he
said
with
his
adorable
naiveté
in
the
same
squatting
position
kept
on
patching
his
old
slipper
i
took
a
step
toward
him
you
heard
what
i
said
to
the
captain
yes
the
targa
answered
calmly
i
am
going
with
him
we
leave
you
at
tit
to
which
place
you
must
bring
us
where
is
the
place
you
proposed
to
show
the
captain
i
did
not
propose
to
show
it
to
him
it
was
his
own
idea
said
the
targa
coldly
the
grottos
with
the
inscriptions
are
march
southward
in
the
mountains
at
first
the
road
is
rather
rough
but
farther
on
it
turns
and
you
gain
timissao
very
easily
there
are
good
wells
where
the
tuareg
taitoqs
who
are
friendly
to
the
french
come
to
water
their
camels
and
you
know
the
road
well
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
eyes
had
a
scornful
smile
i
have
taken
it
twenty
times
he
said
in
that
case
let
get
started
we
rode
for
two
hours
i
did
not
exchange
a
word
with
morhange
i
had
a
clear
intuition
of
the
folly
we
were
committing
in
risking
ourselves
so
unconcernedly
in
that
least
known
and
most
dangerous
part
of
the
sahara
every
blow
which
had
been
struck
in
the
last
twenty
years
to
undermine
the
french
advance
had
come
from
this
redoubtable
ahaggar
but
what
of
it
it
was
of
my
own
will
that
i
had
joined
in
this
mad
scheme
no
need
of
going
over
it
again
what
was
the
use
of
spoiling
my
action
by
a
continual
exhibition
of
disapproval
and
furthermore
i
may
as
well
admit
that
i
rather
liked
the
turn
that
our
trip
was
beginning
to
take
i
had
at
that
instant
the
sensation
of
journeying
toward
something
incredible
toward
some
tremendous
adventure
you
do
not
live
with
impunity
for
months
and
years
as
the
guest
of
the
desert
sooner
or
later
it
has
its
way
with
you
annihilates
the
good
officer
the
timid
executive
overthrows
his
solicitude
for
his
responsibilities
what
is
there
behind
those
mysterious
rocks
those
dim
solitudes
which
have
held
at
bay
the
most
illustrious
pursuers
of
mystery
you
follow
i
tell
you
you
follow
are
you
sure
at
least
that
this
inscription
is
interesting
enough
to
justify
us
in
our
undertaking
i
asked
morhange
my
companion
started
with
pleasure
ever
since
we
began
our
journey
i
had
realized
his
fear
that
i
was
coming
along
as
soon
as
i
offered
him
a
chance
to
convince
me
his
scruples
vanished
and
his
triumph
seemed
assured
to
him
never
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
he
tried
to
control
but
through
which
the
enthusiasm
rang
out
never
has
a
greek
inscription
been
found
so
far
south
the
farthest
points
where
they
have
been
reported
are
in
the
south
of
algeria
and
cyrene
but
in
ahaggar
think
of
it
it
is
true
that
this
one
is
translated
into
tifinar
but
this
peculiarity
does
not
diminish
the
interest
of
the
coincidence
it
increases
it
what
do
you
take
to
be
the
meaning
of
this
word
can
only
be
a
proper
name
said
morhange
to
whom
does
it
refer
i
admit
i
do
know
and
if
at
this
very
moment
i
am
marching
toward
the
south
dragging
you
along
with
me
it
is
because
i
count
on
learning
more
about
it
its
etymology
it
has
one
definitely
but
there
are
thirty
possibilities
bear
in
mind
that
the
tifinar
alphabet
is
far
from
tallying
with
the
greek
alphabet
which
increases
the
number
of
hypotheses
shall
i
suggest
several
i
was
just
about
to
ask
you
to
to
begin
with
there
is
greek
agti
and
greek
neos
woman
who
is
placed
opposite
a
an
explanation
which
would
have
been
pleasing
to
gaffarel
and
to
my
venerated
master
berlioux
that
would
apply
well
enough
to
the
of
ships
there
is
a
technical
term
that
i
can
not
recall
at
this
moment
not
if
you
beat
me
a
hundred
times
over
footnote
it
is
perhaps
worth
noting
here
that
de
is
the
exact
title
of
a
very
remarkable
collection
of
poems
by
mme
note
by
m
leroux
then
there
is
greek
agtinêa
that
you
must
relate
to
greek
agti
and
greek
naos
who
holds
herself
before
greek
naos
the
greek
naos
of
the
temple
who
is
opposite
the
sanctuary
therefore
priestess
an
interpretation
which
would
enchant
girard
and
renan
next
we
have
greek
agtine
from
greek
agti
and
greek
neos
new
which
can
mean
two
things
either
who
is
the
contrary
of
which
is
to
say
old
or
who
is
the
enemy
of
or
enemy
of
there
is
still
another
sense
of
greek
gati
exchange
for
which
is
capable
of
complicating
all
the
others
i
have
mentioned
likewise
there
are
four
meanings
for
the
verb
greek
neô
which
means
in
turn
go
to
flow
to
or
to
there
is
more
still
and
notice
please
that
i
have
not
at
my
disposition
on
the
otherwise
commodious
hump
of
this
mehari
either
the
great
dictionary
of
estienne
or
the
lexicons
of
passow
of
pape
or
of
this
is
only
to
show
you
my
dear
friend
that
epigraphy
is
but
a
relative
science
always
dependent
on
the
discovery
of
a
new
text
which
contradicts
the
previous
findings
when
it
is
not
merely
at
the
mercy
of
the
humors
of
the
epigraphists
and
their
pet
conceptions
of
the
universe
that
was
rather
my
view
of
it
i
said
but
i
must
admit
my
astonishment
to
find
that
with
such
a
sceptical
opinion
of
the
goal
you
still
do
not
hesitate
to
take
risks
which
may
be
quite
considerable
morhange
smiled
wanly
i
do
not
interpret
my
friend
i
collect
from
what
i
will
take
back
to
him
dom
granger
has
the
ability
to
draw
conclusions
which
are
beyond
my
slight
knowledge
i
was
amusing
myself
a
little
pardon
me
just
then
the
girth
of
one
of
the
baggage
camels
evidently
not
well
fastened
came
loose
part
of
the
load
slipped
and
fell
to
the
ground
descended
instantly
from
his
beast
and
helped
repair
the
damage
when
they
had
finished
i
made
my
mehari
walk
beside
it
will
be
better
to
resaddle
the
camels
at
the
next
stop
they
will
have
to
climb
the
mountain
the
guide
looked
at
me
with
amazement
up
to
that
time
i
had
thought
it
unnecessary
to
acquaint
him
with
our
new
projects
but
i
supposed
would
have
told
him
lieutenant
the
road
across
the
white
plain
to
is
not
mountainous
said
the
chaamba
we
are
not
keeping
to
the
road
across
the
white
plain
we
are
going
south
by
ahaggar
by
ahaggar
he
murmured
but
but
what
i
do
not
know
the
road
is
going
to
guide
us
i
watched
as
he
made
this
suppressed
ejaculation
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
targa
with
a
mixture
of
stupor
and
fright
camel
was
a
dozen
yards
ahead
of
us
side
by
side
with
morhange
the
two
men
were
talking
i
realized
that
morhange
must
be
conversing
with
about
the
famous
inscriptions
but
we
were
not
so
far
behind
that
they
could
not
have
overheard
our
words
again
i
looked
at
my
guide
i
saw
that
he
was
pale
what
is
it
i
asked
in
a
low
voice
not
here
lieutenant
not
here
he
muttered
his
teeth
chattered
he
added
in
a
whisper
not
here
this
evening
when
we
stop
when
he
turns
to
the
east
to
pray
when
the
sun
goes
down
then
call
me
to
you
i
will
tell
you
but
not
here
he
is
talking
but
he
is
listening
go
ahead
join
the
captain
what
next
i
murmured
pressing
my
camel
neck
with
my
foot
so
as
to
make
him
overtake
morhange
it
was
about
five
when
who
was
leading
the
way
came
to
a
stop
here
it
is
he
said
getting
down
from
his
camel
it
was
a
beautiful
and
sinister
place
to
our
left
a
fantastic
wall
of
granite
outlined
its
gray
ribs
against
the
sky
this
wall
was
pierced
from
top
to
bottom
by
a
winding
corridor
about
a
thousand
feet
high
and
scarcely
wide
enough
in
places
to
allow
three
camels
to
walk
abreast
here
it
is
repeated
the
targa
to
the
west
straight
behind
us
the
track
that
we
were
leaving
unrolled
like
a
pale
ribbon
the
white
plain
the
road
to
the
established
halts
the
wells
and
on
the
other
side
this
black
wall
against
the
mauve
sky
this
dark
passage
i
looked
at
morhange
we
had
better
stop
here
he
said
simply
advises
us
to
take
as
much
water
here
as
we
can
carry
with
one
accord
we
decided
to
spend
the
night
there
before
undertaking
the
mountain
there
was
a
spring
in
a
dark
basin
from
which
fell
a
little
cascade
there
were
a
few
shrubs
a
few
plants
already
the
camels
were
browsing
at
the
length
of
their
tethers
arranged
our
camp
dinner
service
of
tin
cups
and
plates
on
a
great
flat
stone
an
opened
tin
of
meat
lay
beside
a
plate
of
lettuce
which
he
had
just
gathered
from
the
moist
earth
around
the
spring
i
could
tell
from
the
distracted
manner
in
which
he
placed
these
objects
upon
the
rock
how
deep
was
his
anxiety
as
he
was
bending
toward
me
to
hand
me
a
plate
he
pointed
to
the
gloomy
black
corridor
which
we
were
about
to
enter
he
murmured
what
did
he
say
asked
morhange
who
had
seen
the
gesture
this
is
the
country
of
that
is
what
the
arabs
call
ahaggar
went
a
little
distance
off
and
sat
down
leaving
us
to
our
dinner
squatting
on
his
heels
he
began
to
eat
a
few
lettuce
leaves
that
he
had
kept
for
his
own
meal
was
still
motionless
suddenly
the
targa
rose
the
sun
in
the
west
was
no
larger
than
a
red
brand
we
saw
approach
the
fountain
spread
his
blue
burnous
on
the
ground
and
kneel
upon
it
i
did
not
suppose
that
the
tuareg
were
so
observant
of
mussulman
tradition
said
morhange
nor
i
i
replied
thoughtfully
but
i
had
something
to
do
at
that
moment
besides
making
such
speculations
i
called
at
the
same
time
i
looked
at
absorbed
in
his
prayer
bowed
toward
the
west
apparently
he
was
paying
no
attention
to
me
as
he
prostrated
himself
i
called
again
come
with
me
to
my
mehari
i
want
to
get
something
out
of
the
saddle
bags
still
kneeling
was
mumbling
his
prayer
slowly
composedly
but
had
not
budged
his
only
response
was
a
deep
moan
morhange
and
i
leaped
to
our
feet
and
ran
to
the
guide
reached
him
as
soon
as
we
did
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
limbs
already
cold
the
chaamba
breathed
a
death
rattle
in
morhange
arms
i
had
seized
one
of
his
hands
took
the
other
each
in
his
own
way
was
trying
to
divine
to
understand
suddenly
leapt
to
his
feet
he
had
just
seen
the
poor
embossed
bowl
which
the
arab
had
held
an
instant
before
between
his
knees
and
which
now
lay
overturned
upon
the
ground
he
picked
it
up
looked
quickly
at
one
after
another
of
the
leaves
of
lettuce
remaining
in
it
and
then
gave
a
hoarse
exclamation
so
said
morhange
it
his
turn
now
he
is
going
to
go
mad
watching
closely
i
saw
him
hasten
without
a
word
to
the
rock
where
our
dinner
was
set
a
second
later
he
was
again
beside
us
holding
out
the
bowl
of
lettuce
which
he
had
not
yet
touched
then
he
took
a
thick
long
pale
green
leaf
from
bowl
and
held
it
beside
another
leaf
he
had
just
taken
from
our
bowl
was
all
he
said
i
shuddered
and
so
did
morhange
it
was
the
the
of
the
arabs
of
the
sahara
the
terrible
plant
which
had
killed
a
part
of
the
flatters
mission
more
quickly
and
surely
than
tuareg
arms
stood
up
his
tall
silhouette
was
outlined
blackly
against
the
sky
which
suddenly
had
turned
pale
lilac
he
was
watching
us
we
bent
again
over
the
unfortunate
guide
the
targa
repeated
and
shook
his
head
died
in
the
middle
of
the
night
without
having
regained
consciousness
vii
the
country
of
fear
it
is
curious
said
morhange
to
see
how
our
expedition
uneventful
since
we
left
ouargla
is
now
becoming
exciting
he
said
this
after
kneeling
for
a
moment
in
prayer
before
the
painfully
dug
grave
in
which
we
had
lain
the
guide
i
do
not
believe
in
god
but
if
anything
can
influence
whatever
powers
there
may
be
whether
of
good
or
of
evil
of
light
or
of
darkness
it
is
the
prayer
of
such
a
man
for
two
days
we
picked
our
way
through
a
gigantic
chaos
of
black
rock
in
what
might
have
been
the
country
of
the
moon
so
barren
was
it
no
sound
but
that
of
stones
rolling
under
the
feet
of
the
camels
and
striking
like
gunshots
at
the
foot
of
the
precipices
a
strange
march
indeed
for
the
first
few
hours
i
tried
to
pick
out
by
compass
the
route
we
were
following
but
my
calculations
were
soon
upset
doubtless
a
mistake
due
to
the
swaying
motion
of
the
camel
i
put
the
compass
back
in
one
of
my
from
that
time
on
was
our
master
we
could
only
trust
ourselves
to
him
he
went
first
morhange
followed
him
and
i
brought
up
the
rear
we
passed
at
every
step
most
curious
specimens
of
volcanic
rock
but
i
did
not
examine
them
i
was
no
longer
interested
in
such
things
another
kind
of
curiosity
had
taken
possession
of
me
i
had
come
to
share
morhange
madness
if
my
companion
had
said
to
me
we
are
doing
a
very
rash
thing
let
us
go
back
to
the
known
trails
i
should
have
replied
you
are
free
to
do
as
you
please
but
i
am
going
on
toward
evening
of
the
second
day
we
found
ourselves
at
the
foot
of
a
black
mountain
whose
jagged
ramparts
towered
in
profile
seven
thousand
feet
above
our
heads
it
was
an
enormous
shadowy
fortress
like
the
outline
of
a
feudal
stronghold
silhouetted
with
incredible
sharpness
against
the
orange
sky
there
was
a
well
with
several
trees
the
first
we
had
seen
since
cutting
into
ahaggar
a
group
of
men
were
standing
about
it
their
camels
tethered
close
by
were
cropping
a
mouthful
here
and
there
at
seeing
us
the
men
drew
together
alert
on
the
defensive
turned
to
us
and
said
eggali
tuareg
we
went
toward
them
they
were
handsome
men
those
eggali
the
largest
tuareg
whom
i
ever
have
seen
with
unexpected
swiftness
they
drew
aside
from
the
well
leaving
it
to
us
spoke
a
few
words
to
them
they
looked
at
morhange
and
me
with
a
curiosity
bordering
on
fear
but
at
any
rate
with
respect
i
drew
several
little
presents
from
my
saddlebags
and
was
astonished
at
the
reserve
of
the
chief
who
refused
them
he
seemed
afraid
even
of
my
glance
when
they
had
gone
i
expressed
my
astonishment
at
this
shyness
for
which
my
previous
experiences
with
the
tribes
of
the
sahara
had
not
prepared
me
they
spoke
with
respect
even
with
fear
i
said
to
and
yet
the
tribe
of
the
eggali
is
noble
and
that
of
the
to
which
you
tell
me
you
belong
is
a
slave
tribe
a
smile
lighted
the
dark
eyes
of
it
is
true
he
said
well
then
i
told
them
that
we
three
the
captain
you
and
i
were
bound
for
the
mountain
of
the
evil
spirits
with
a
gesture
he
indicated
the
black
mountain
they
are
afraid
all
the
tuareg
of
ahaggar
are
afraid
of
the
mountain
of
the
evil
spirits
you
saw
how
they
were
up
and
off
at
the
very
mention
of
its
name
it
is
to
the
mountain
of
the
evil
spirits
that
you
are
taking
us
queried
morhange
yes
replied
the
targa
that
is
where
the
inscriptions
are
that
i
told
you
about
you
did
not
mention
that
detail
to
us
why
should
i
the
tuareg
are
afraid
of
the
spirits
with
horns
and
tails
covered
with
hair
who
make
the
cattle
sicken
and
die
and
cast
spells
over
men
but
i
know
well
that
the
christians
are
not
afraid
and
even
laugh
at
the
fears
of
the
tuareg
and
you
i
asked
you
are
a
targa
and
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
showed
a
little
red
leather
bag
hung
about
his
neck
on
a
chain
of
white
seeds
i
have
my
amulet
he
replied
gravely
blessed
by
the
venerable
himself
and
then
i
am
with
you
you
saved
my
life
you
have
desired
to
see
the
inscriptions
the
will
of
allah
be
done
as
he
finished
speaking
he
squatted
on
his
heels
drew
out
his
long
reed
pipe
and
began
to
smoke
gravely
all
this
is
beginning
to
seem
very
strange
said
morhange
coming
over
to
me
you
can
say
that
without
exaggeration
i
replied
you
remember
as
well
as
i
the
passage
in
which
barth
tells
of
his
expedition
to
the
idinen
the
mountain
of
the
evil
spirits
of
the
azdjer
tuareg
the
region
had
so
evil
a
reputation
that
no
targa
would
go
with
him
but
he
got
back
yes
he
got
back
replied
my
comrade
but
only
after
he
had
been
lost
without
water
or
food
he
came
so
near
dying
of
hunger
and
thirst
that
he
had
to
open
a
vein
and
drink
his
own
blood
the
prospect
is
not
particularly
attractive
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
after
all
it
was
not
my
fault
that
we
were
there
morhange
understood
my
gesture
and
thought
it
necessary
to
make
excuses
i
should
be
curious
he
went
on
with
rather
forced
gaiety
to
meet
these
spirits
and
substantiate
the
facts
of
pomponius
mela
who
knew
them
and
locates
them
in
fact
in
the
mountain
of
the
tuareg
he
calls
them
blemyens
gamphasantes
satyrs
he
says
naked
the
have
no
head
their
faces
are
placed
on
their
chests
the
have
nothing
like
men
except
faces
the
are
made
as
is
commonly
described
is
it
very
strange
to
find
greek
names
given
to
the
barbarian
spirits
of
this
region
believe
me
we
are
on
a
curious
trail
i
am
sure
that
antinea
will
be
our
key
to
remarkable
discoveries
listen
i
said
laying
a
finger
on
my
lips
strange
sounds
rose
from
about
us
as
the
evening
advanced
with
great
strides
a
kind
of
crackling
followed
by
long
rending
shrieks
echoed
and
reechoed
to
infinity
in
the
neighboring
ravines
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
whole
black
mountain
suddenly
had
begun
to
moan
we
looked
at
he
was
smoking
on
without
twitching
a
muscle
the
are
waking
up
he
said
simply
morhange
listened
without
saying
a
word
doubtless
he
understood
as
i
did
the
overheated
rocks
the
crackling
of
the
stone
a
whole
series
of
physical
phenomena
the
example
of
the
singing
statue
of
memnon
but
for
all
that
this
unexpected
concert
reacted
no
less
painfully
on
our
overstrained
nerves
the
last
words
of
poor
came
to
my
mind
the
country
of
fear
i
murmured
in
a
low
voice
and
morhange
repeated
the
country
of
fear
the
strange
concert
ceased
as
the
first
stars
appeared
in
the
sky
with
deep
emotion
we
watched
the
tiny
bluish
flames
appear
one
after
another
at
that
portentous
moment
they
seemed
to
span
the
distance
between
us
isolated
condemned
lost
and
our
brothers
of
higher
latitudes
who
at
that
hour
were
rushing
about
their
poor
pleasures
with
delirious
frenzy
in
cities
where
the
whiteness
of
electric
lamps
came
on
in
a
burst

barâd
voice
raised
itself
in
slow
guttural
tones
it
resounded
with
sad
grave
majesty
in
the
silence
now
complete
i
touched
the
targa
arm
with
a
movement
of
his
head
he
pointed
to
a
constellation
glittering
in
the
firmament
the
pleiades
i
murmured
to
morhange
showing
him
the
seven
pale
stars
while
took
up
his
mournful
song
in
the
same
monotone

the

a

one
of
whose

away
a
sudden
sickness
came
over
me
i
seized
the
targa
arm
as
he
was
starting
to
intone
his
refrain
for
the
third
time
when
will
we
reach
this
cave
with
the
inscriptions
i
asked
brusquely
he
looked
at
me
and
replied
with
his
usual
calm
we
are
there
we
are
there
then
why
do
you
show
it
to
us
you
did
not
ask
me
he
replied
not
without
a
touch
of
insolence
morhange
had
jumped
to
his
feet
the
cave
is
here
it
is
here
replied
slowly
rising
to
his
feet
take
us
to
it
morhange
i
said
suddenly
anxious
night
is
falling
we
will
see
nothing
and
perhaps
it
is
still
some
way
off
it
is
hardly
five
hundred
paces
replied
the
cave
is
full
of
dead
underbrush
we
will
set
it
on
fire
and
the
captain
will
see
as
in
full
daylight
come
my
comrade
repeated
and
the
camels
i
hazarded
they
are
tethered
said
and
we
shall
not
be
gone
long
he
had
started
toward
the
black
mountain
morhange
trembling
with
excitement
followed
i
followed
too
the
victim
of
profound
uneasiness
my
pulses
throbbed
i
am
not
afraid
i
kept
repeating
to
myself
i
swear
that
this
is
not
fear
and
really
it
was
not
fear
yet
what
a
strange
dizziness
there
was
a
mist
over
my
eyes
my
ears
buzzed
again
i
heard
voice
but
multiplied
immense
and
at
the
same
time
very
low
the
daughters
of
the
night
are
seven
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
voice
of
the
mountain
repeated
that
sinister
last
line
to
infinity
and
the
seventh
is
a
boy
one
of
whose
eyes
has
flown
away
here
it
is
said
the
targa
a
black
hole
in
the
wall
opened
up
bending
over
entered
we
followed
him
the
darkness
closed
around
us
a
yellow
flame
had
struck
his
flint
he
set
fire
to
a
pile
of
brush
near
the
surface
at
first
we
could
see
nothing
the
smoke
blinded
us
stayed
at
one
side
of
the
opening
of
the
cave
he
was
seated
and
more
inscrutible
than
ever
had
begun
again
to
blow
great
puffs
of
gray
smoke
from
his
pipe
the
burning
brush
cast
a
flickering
light
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
morhange
he
seemed
very
pale
with
both
hands
braced
against
the
wall
he
was
working
to
decipher
a
mass
of
signs
which
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
nevertheless
i
thought
i
could
see
his
hands
trembling
the
devil
i
thought
finding
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
my
thoughts
he
seems
to
be
as
unstrung
as
i
i
heard
him
call
out
to
in
what
seemed
to
me
a
loud
voice
stand
to
one
side
let
the
air
in
what
a
smoke
he
kept
on
working
at
the
signs
suddenly
i
heard
him
again
but
with
difficulty
it
seemed
as
if
even
sounds
were
confused
in
the
smoke
antinea
at
last
antinea
but
not
cut
in
the
rock
the
marks
traced
in
ochre
not
ten
years
old
perhaps
not
five
oh
he
pressed
his
hands
to
his
head
again
he
cried
out
it
is
a
mystery
a
tragic
mystery
i
laughed
teasingly
come
on
come
on
do
get
excited
over
it
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
shook
me
i
saw
his
eyes
big
with
terror
and
astonishment
are
you
mad
he
yelled
in
my
face
not
so
loud
i
replied
with
the
same
little
laugh
he
looked
at
me
again
and
sank
down
overcome
on
a
rock
opposite
me
was
still
smoking
placidly
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
we
could
see
the
red
circle
of
his
pipe
glowing
in
the
darkness
madman
madman
repeated
morhange
his
voice
seemed
to
stick
in
his
throat
suddenly
he
bent
over
the
brush
which
was
giving
its
last
darts
of
flame
high
and
clear
he
picked
out
a
branch
which
had
not
yet
caught
i
saw
him
examine
it
carefully
then
throw
it
back
in
the
fire
with
a
loud
laugh
ha
ha
that
good
all
right
he
staggered
toward
pointing
to
the
fire
it
hemp
hasheesh
hasheesh
oh
that
a
good
one
all
right
yes
it
a
good
one
i
repeated
bursting
into
laughter
quietly
smiled
approval
the
dying
fire
lit
his
inscrutable
face
and
flickered
in
his
terrible
dark
eyes
a
moment
passed
suddenly
morhange
seized
the
targa
arm
i
want
to
smoke
too
he
said
give
me
a
pipe
the
specter
gave
him
one
what
a
european
pipe
a
european
pipe
i
repeated
feeling
gayer
and
gayer
with
an
initial
as
if
made
on
purpose
m
captain
morhange
masson
corrected
quietly
captain
masson
i
repeated
in
concert
with
morhange
we
laughed
again
ha
ha
ha
captain
masson
colonel
flatters
the
well
of
garama
they
killed
him
to
take
his
pipe
that
pipe
it
was
who
killed
captain
masson
it
was
repeated
the
targa
with
imperturbable
calm
captain
masson
and
colonel
flatters
had
left
the
convoy
to
look
for
the
well
said
morhange
laughing
it
was
then
that
the
tuareg
attacked
them
i
finished
laughing
as
hard
as
i
could
a
targa
of
ahagga
seized
the
bridle
of
captain
masson
horse
said
morhange
had
hold
of
colonel
flatters
bridle
put
in
the
colonel
puts
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
receives
a
cut
from
saber
i
said
captain
masson
draws
his
revolver
and
fires
on
shooting
off
three
fingers
of
his
left
hand
said
morhange
but
finished
imperturbably
but
with
one
blow
of
his
saber
splits
captain
masson
he
gave
a
silent
satisfied
laugh
as
he
spoke
the
dying
flame
lit
up
his
face
we
saw
the
gleaming
black
stem
of
his
pipe
he
held
it
in
his
left
hand
one
finger
no
two
fingers
only
on
that
hand
hello
i
had
not
noticed
that
before
morhange
also
noticed
it
for
he
finished
with
a
loud
laugh
then
after
splitting
his
skull
you
robbed
him
you
took
his
pipe
from
him
bravo
does
not
reply
but
i
can
see
how
satisfied
with
himself
he
is
he
keeps
on
smoking
i
can
hardly
see
his
features
now
the
firelight
pales
dies
i
have
never
laughed
so
much
as
this
evening
i
am
sure
morhange
never
has
either
perhaps
he
will
forget
the
cloister
and
all
because
stole
captain
masson
pipe
again
that
accursed
song
the
seventh
is
a
boy
one
of
whose
eyes
has
flown
away
one
can
not
imagine
more
senseless
words
it
is
very
strange
really
there
seem
to
be
four
of
us
in
this
cave
now
four
i
say
five
six
seven
eight
make
yourselves
at
home
my
friends
what
there
are
no
more
of
you
i
am
going
to
find
out
at
last
how
the
spirits
of
this
region
are
made
the
the
morhange
says
that
the
have
their
faces
on
the
middle
of
their
chests
surely
this
one
who
is
seizing
me
in
his
arms
is
not
a
now
he
is
carrying
me
outside
and
morhange
i
do
not
want
them
to
forget
morhange
they
did
not
forget
him
i
see
him
perched
on
a
camel
in
front
of
that
one
to
which
i
am
fastened
they
did
well
to
fasten
me
for
otherwise
i
surely
would
tumble
off
these
spirits
certainly
are
not
bad
fellows
but
what
a
long
way
it
is
i
want
to
stretch
out
to
sleep
a
while
ago
we
surely
were
following
a
long
passage
then
we
were
in
the
open
air
now
we
are
again
in
an
endless
stifling
corridor
here
are
the
stars
again
is
this
ridiculous
course
going
to
keep
on
hello
lights
stars
perhaps
no
lights
i
say
a
stairway
on
my
word
of
rocks
to
be
sure
but
still
a
stairway
how
can
the
camels
but
it
is
no
longer
a
camel
this
is
a
man
carrying
me
a
man
dressed
in
white
not
a
nor
a
morhange
must
be
giving
himself
airs
with
his
historical
reasoning
all
false
i
repeat
all
false
good
morhange
provided
that
his
does
not
let
him
fall
on
this
unending
stairway
something
glitters
on
the
ceiling
yes
it
is
a
lamp
a
copper
lamp
as
at
tunis
at
barbouchy
good
here
again
you
can
not
see
anything
but
i
am
making
a
fool
of
myself
i
am
lying
down
now
i
can
go
to
sleep
what
a
silly
day
gentlemen
i
assure
you
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
bind
me
i
do
not
want
to
go
down
on
the
boulevards
darkness
again
steps
of
someone
going
away
silence
but
only
for
a
moment
someone
is
talking
beside
me
what
are
they
saying
no
it
is
impossible
that
metallic
ring
that
voice
do
you
know
what
it
is
calling
that
voice
do
you
know
what
it
is
calling
in
the
tones
of
someone
used
to
the
phrase
well
it
is
calling
play
your
cards
gentlemen
play
your
cards
there
are
ten
thousand
in
the
bank
play
your
cards
gentlemen
in
the
name
of
god
am
i
or
am
i
not
at
ahaggar
viii
awakening
at
ahaggar
it
was
broad
daylight
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
thought
at
once
of
morhange
i
could
not
see
him
but
i
heard
him
close
by
giving
little
grunts
of
surprise
i
called
to
him
he
ran
to
me
then
they
did
tie
you
up
i
asked
i
beg
your
pardon
they
did
but
they
did
it
badly
i
managed
to
get
free
you
might
have
untied
me
too
i
remarked
crossly
what
good
would
it
have
done
i
should
only
have
waked
you
up
and
i
thought
that
your
first
word
would
be
to
call
me
there
that
done
i
reeled
as
i
tried
to
stand
on
my
feet
morhange
smiled
we
might
have
spent
the
whole
night
smoking
and
drinking
and
not
been
in
a
worse
state
he
said
anyhow
that
with
his
hasheesh
is
a
fine
rascal
i
corrected
i
rubbed
my
hand
over
my
forehead
where
are
we
my
dear
boy
morhange
replied
since
i
awakened
from
the
extraordinary
nightmare
which
is
mixed
up
with
the
smoky
cave
and
the
stairway
of
the
arabian
nights
i
have
been
going
from
surprise
to
surprise
from
confusion
to
confusion
just
look
around
you
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
stared
then
i
seized
my
friend
hand
morhange
i
begged
tell
me
if
we
are
still
dreaming
we
were
in
a
round
room
perhaps
fifty
feet
in
diameter
and
of
about
the
same
height
lighted
by
a
great
window
opening
on
a
sky
of
intense
blue
swallows
flew
back
and
forth
outside
giving
quick
joyous
cries
the
floor
the
incurving
walls
and
the
ceiling
were
of
a
kind
of
veined
marble
like
porphyry
panelled
with
a
strange
metal
paler
than
gold
darker
than
silver
clouded
just
then
by
the
early
morning
mist
that
came
in
through
the
window
in
great
puffs
i
staggered
toward
this
window
drawn
by
the
freshness
of
the
breeze
and
the
sunlight
which
was
chasing
away
my
dreams
and
i
leaned
my
elbows
on
the
balustrade
i
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
delight
i
was
standing
on
a
kind
of
balcony
cut
into
the
flank
of
a
mountain
overhanging
an
abyss
above
me
blue
sky
below
appeared
a
veritable
earthly
paradise
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
mountains
that
formed
a
continuous
and
impassable
wall
about
it
a
garden
lay
spread
out
down
there
the
palm
trees
gently
swayed
their
great
fronds
at
their
feet
was
a
tangle
of
the
smaller
trees
which
grow
in
an
oasis
under
their
protection
almonds
lemons
oranges
and
many
others
which
i
could
not
distinguish
from
that
height
a
broad
blue
stream
fed
by
a
waterfall
emptied
into
a
charming
lake
the
waters
of
which
had
the
marvellous
transparency
which
comes
in
high
altitudes
great
birds
flew
in
circles
over
this
green
hollow
i
could
see
in
the
lake
the
red
flash
of
a
flamingo
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
which
towered
on
all
sides
were
completely
covered
with
snow
the
blue
stream
the
green
palms
the
golden
fruit
and
above
it
all
the
miraculous
snow
all
this
bathed
in
that
limpid
air
gave
such
an
impression
of
beauty
of
purity
that
my
poor
human
strength
could
no
longer
stand
the
sight
of
it
i
laid
my
forehead
on
the
balustrade
which
too
was
covered
with
that
heavenly
snow
and
began
to
cry
like
a
baby
morhange
was
behaving
like
another
child
but
he
had
awakened
before
i
had
and
doubtless
had
had
time
to
grasp
one
by
one
all
these
details
whose
fantastic
staggered
me
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
gently
pulled
me
back
into
the
room
you
have
seen
anything
yet
he
said
look
look
morhange
well
old
man
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it
look
i
had
just
realized
that
the
strange
room
was
furnished
god
forgive
me
in
the
european
fashion
there
were
indeed
here
and
there
round
leather
tuareg
cushions
brightly
colored
blankets
from
gafsa
rugs
from
kairouan
and
caramani
hangings
which
at
that
moment
i
should
have
dreaded
to
draw
aside
but
a
panel
in
the
wall
showed
a
bookcase
crowded
with
books
a
whole
row
of
photographs
of
masterpieces
of
ancient
art
were
hung
on
the
walls
finally
there
was
a
table
almost
hidden
under
its
heap
of
papers
pamphlets
books
i
thought
i
should
collapse
at
seeing
a
recent
number
of
the
i
looked
at
morhange
he
was
looking
at
me
and
suddenly
a
mad
laugh
seized
us
and
doubled
us
up
for
a
good
minute
i
do
not
know
morhange
finally
managed
to
say
whether
or
not
we
shall
regret
some
day
our
little
excursion
into
ahaggar
but
admit
in
the
meantime
that
it
promises
to
be
rich
in
unexpected
adventures
that
unforgettable
guide
who
puts
us
to
sleep
just
to
distract
us
from
the
unpleasantness
of
caravan
life
and
who
lets
me
experience
in
the
best
of
good
faith
the
delights
of
hasheesh
that
fantastic
night
ride
and
to
cap
the
climax
this
cave
of
a
nureddin
who
must
have
received
the
education
of
the
athenian
bersot
at
the
french
all
this
is
enough
on
my
word
to
upset
the
wits
of
the
best
balanced
what
do
i
think
my
poor
friend
why
just
what
you
yourself
think
i
do
understand
it
at
all
not
at
all
what
you
politely
call
my
learning
is
not
worth
a
cent
and
why
should
i
be
all
mixed
up
this
living
in
caves
amazes
me
pliny
speaks
of
the
natives
living
in
caves
seven
days
march
southwest
of
the
country
of
the
amantes
and
twelve
days
to
the
westward
of
the
great
syrte
herodotus
says
also
that
the
garamentes
used
to
go
out
in
their
chariots
to
hunt
the
ethopians
but
here
we
are
in
ahaggar
in
the
midst
of
the
targa
country
and
the
best
authorities
tell
us
that
the
tuareg
never
have
been
willing
to
live
in
caves
duveyrier
is
precise
on
that
point
and
what
is
this
i
ask
you
but
a
cave
turned
into
a
workroom
with
pictures
of
the
venus
de
medici
and
the
apollo
sauroctone
on
the
walls
i
tell
you
that
it
is
enough
to
drive
you
mad
and
morhange
threw
himself
on
a
couch
and
began
to
roar
with
laughter
again
see
i
said
this
is
latin
i
had
picked
up
several
scattered
papers
from
the
in
the
middle
of
the
room
morhange
took
them
from
my
hands
and
devoured
them
greedily
his
face
expressed
unbounded
stupefaction
stranger
and
stranger
my
boy
someone
here
is
composing
with
much
citation
of
texts
a
dissertation
on
the
gorgon
islands

to

it
is
there
that
perseus
ah
morhange
words
choked
in
his
throat
a
sharp
shrill
voice
pierced
the
immense
room
gentlemen
i
beg
you
let
my
papers
alone
i
turned
toward
the
newcomer
one
of
the
caramani
curtains
was
drawn
aside
and
the
most
unexpected
of
persons
came
in
resigned
as
we
were
to
unexpected
events
the
improbability
of
this
sight
exceeded
anything
our
imaginations
could
have
devised
on
the
threshold
stood
a
little
man
with
a
pointed
sallow
face
half
hidden
by
an
enormous
pair
of
green
spectacles
and
a
pepper
and
salt
beard
no
shirt
was
visible
but
an
impressive
broad
red
cravat
he
wore
white
trousers
red
leather
slippers
furnished
the
only
oriental
suggestion
of
his
costume
he
wore
not
without
pride
the
rosette
of
an
officer
of
the
department
of
education
he
collected
the
papers
which
morhange
had
dropped
in
his
amazement
counted
them
arranged
them
then
casting
a
peevish
glance
at
us
he
struck
a
copper
gong
the
portiére
was
raised
again
a
huge
white
targa
entered
i
seemed
to
recognize
him
as
one
of
the
genii
of
the
cave

were

the

respectfully

expected
he
replied
and
last
night
the
embalmers
had
not
yet
finished
they
brought
them
here
in
the
meantime
and
he
pointed
to
us
very
well
you
may
go
snapped
the
little
man
ferradji
backed
toward
the
door
on
the
threshold
he
stopped
and
spoke
again
i
was
to
remind
you
sir
that
dinner
is
served
all
right
go
along
and
the
little
man
seated
himself
at
the
desk
and
began
to
finger
the
papers
feverishly
i
do
not
know
why
but
a
mad
feeling
of
exasperation
seized
me
i
walked
toward
him
sir
i
said
my
friend
and
i
do
not
know
where
we
are
nor
who
you
are
we
can
see
only
that
you
are
french
since
you
are
wearing
one
of
the
highest
honorary
decorations
of
our
country
you
may
have
made
the
same
observation
on
your
part
i
added
indicating
the
slender
red
ribbon
which
i
wore
on
my
vest
he
looked
at
me
in
contemptuous
surprise
well
sir
well
sir
the
negro
who
just
went
out
pronounced
the
name
of
the
name
of
a
brigand
a
bandit
one
of
the
assassins
of
colonel
flatters
are
you
acquainted
with
that
detail
sir
the
little
man
surveyed
me
coldly
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
certainly
but
what
difference
do
you
suppose
that
makes
to
me
what
i
cried
beside
myself
with
rage
who
are
you
anyway
sir
said
the
little
old
man
with
comical
dignity
turning
to
morhange
i
call
you
to
witness
the
strange
manners
of
your
companion
i
am
here
in
my
own
house
and
i
do
not
allow
you
must
excuse
my
comrade
sir
said
morhange
stepping
forward
he
is
not
a
man
of
letters
as
you
are
these
young
lieutenants
are
you
know
and
besides
you
can
understand
why
both
of
us
are
not
as
calm
as
might
be
desired
i
was
furious
and
on
the
point
of
disavowing
these
strangely
humble
words
of
morhange
but
a
glance
showed
me
that
there
was
as
much
irony
as
surprise
in
his
expression
i
know
indeed
that
most
officers
are
brutes
grumbled
the
little
old
man
but
that
is
no
reason
i
am
only
an
officer
myself
morhange
went
on
in
an
even
humbler
tone
and
if
ever
i
have
been
sensible
to
the
intellectual
inferiority
of
that
class
i
assure
you
that
it
was
now
in
glancing
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
taken
the
liberty
to
do
so
in
glancing
over
the
learned
pages
which
you
devote
to
the
passionate
story
of
medusa
according
to
procles
of
carthage
cited
by
pausanias
a
laughable
surprise
spread
over
the
features
of
the
little
old
man
he
hastily
wiped
his
spectacles
what
he
finally
cried
it
is
indeed
unfortunate
in
this
matter
morhange
continued
imperturbably
that
we
are
not
in
possession
of
the
curious
dissertation
devoted
to
this
burning
question
by
statius
sebosus
a
work
which
we
know
only
through
pliny
and
which
you
know
statius
sebosus
and
which
my
master
the
geographer
berlioux
you
knew
berlioux
you
were
his
pupil
stammered
the
little
man
with
the
decoration
i
have
had
that
honor
replied
morhange
very
coldly
but
but
sir
then
you
have
heard
mentioned
you
are
familiar
with
the
question
the
problem
of
atlantis
indeed
i
am
not
unacquainted
with
the
works
of
lagneau
ploix
arbois
de
jubainville
said
morhange
frigidly
my
god
the
little
man
was
going
through
extraordinary
contortions
sir
captain
how
happy
i
am
how
many
excuses
just
then
the
portiére
was
raised
ferradji
appeared
again
sir
they
want
me
to
tell
you
that
unless
you
come
they
will
begin
without
you
i
am
coming
i
am
coming
say
ferradji
that
we
will
be
there
in
a
moment
why
sir
if
i
had
foreseen
it
is
extraordinary
to
find
an
officer
who
knows
procles
of
carthage
and
arbois
de
jubainville
again
but
i
must
introduce
myself
i
am
etienne
le
mesge
fellow
of
the
university
captain
morhange
said
my
companion
i
stepped
forward
in
my
turn
lieutenant
de
it
is
a
fact
sir
that
i
am
very
likely
to
confuse
arbois
of
carthage
with
procles
de
jubainville
later
i
shall
have
to
see
about
filling
up
those
gaps
but
just
now
i
should
like
to
know
where
we
are
if
we
are
free
and
if
not
what
occult
power
holds
us
you
have
the
appearance
sir
of
being
sufficiently
at
home
in
this
house
to
be
able
to
enlighten
us
upon
this
point
which
i
must
confess
i
weakly
consider
of
the
first
importance
le
mesge
looked
at
me
a
rather
malevolent
smile
twitched
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
opened
his
lips
a
gong
sounded
impatiently
in
good
time
gentlemen
i
will
tell
you
i
will
explain
everything
but
now
you
see
that
we
must
hurry
it
is
time
for
lunch
and
our
fellow
diners
will
get
tired
of
waiting
our
fellow
diners
there
are
two
of
them
le
mesge
explained
we
three
constitute
the
european
personnel
of
the
house
that
is
the
fixed
personnel
he
seemed
to
feel
obliged
to
add
with
his
disquieting
smile
two
strange
fellows
gentlemen
with
whom
doubtless
you
will
care
to
have
as
little
to
do
as
possible
one
is
a
churchman
though
a
protestant
the
other
is
a
man
of
the
world
gone
astray
an
old
fool
pardon
i
said
but
it
must
have
been
he
whom
i
heard
last
night
he
was
gambling
with
you
and
the
minister
doubtless
le
mesge
made
a
gesture
of
offended
dignity
the
idea
with
me
sir
it
is
with
the
tuareg
that
he
plays
he
teaches
them
every
game
imaginable
there
that
is
he
who
is
striking
the
gong
to
hurry
us
up
it
is
half
past
nine
and
the
de
trente
et
opens
at
ten
let
us
hurry
i
suppose
that
anyway
you
will
not
be
averse
to
a
little
refreshment
indeed
we
shall
not
refuse
morhange
replied
we
followed
le
mesge
along
a
long
winding
corridor
with
frequent
steps
the
passage
was
dark
but
at
intervals
night
lights
and
incense
burners
were
placed
in
niches
cut
into
the
solid
rock
the
passionate
oriental
scents
perfumed
the
darkness
and
contrasted
strangely
with
the
cold
air
of
the
snowy
peaks
from
time
to
time
a
white
targa
mute
and
expressionless
as
a
phantom
would
pass
us
and
we
would
hear
the
clatter
of
his
slippers
die
away
behind
us
le
mesge
stopped
before
a
heavy
door
covered
with
the
same
pale
metal
which
i
had
noticed
on
the
walls
of
the
library
he
opened
it
and
stood
aside
to
let
us
pass
although
the
dining
room
which
we
entered
had
little
in
common
with
european
dining
rooms
i
have
known
many
which
might
have
envied
its
comfort
like
the
library
it
was
lighted
by
a
great
window
but
i
noticed
that
it
had
an
outside
exposure
while
that
of
the
library
overlooked
the
garden
in
the
center
of
the
crown
of
mountains
no
center
table
and
none
of
those
barbaric
pieces
of
furniture
that
we
call
chairs
but
a
great
number
of
buffet
tables
of
gilded
wood
like
those
of
venice
heavy
hangings
of
dull
and
subdued
colors
and
cushions
tuareg
or
tunisian
in
the
center
was
a
huge
mat
on
which
a
feast
was
placed
in
finely
woven
baskets
among
silver
pitchers
and
copper
basins
filled
with
perfumed
water
the
sight
of
it
filled
me
with
childish
satisfaction
le
mesge
stepped
forward
and
introduced
us
to
the
two
persons
who
already
had
taken
their
places
on
the
mat
spardek
he
said
and
by
that
simple
phrase
i
understood
how
far
our
host
placed
himself
above
vain
human
titles
the
reverend
spardek
of
manchester
bowed
reservedly
and
asked
our
permission
to
keep
on
his
tall
hat
he
was
a
dry
cold
man
tall
and
thin
he
ate
in
pious
sadness
enormously
monsieur
bielowsky
said
le
mesge
introducing
us
to
the
second
guest
count
casimir
bielowsky
hetman
of
jitomir
the
latter
corrected
with
perfect
good
humor
as
he
stood
up
to
shake
hands
i
felt
at
once
a
certain
liking
for
the
hetman
of
jitomir
who
was
a
perfect
example
of
an
old
beau
his
hair
was
parted
in
the
center
later
i
found
out
that
the
hetman
dyed
it
with
a
concoction
of
he
had
magnificent
whiskers
also
in
the
style
of
the
emperor
francis
joseph
his
nose
was
undeniably
a
little
red
but
so
fine
so
aristocratic
his
hands
were
marvelous
it
took
some
thought
to
place
the
date
of
the
style
of
the
count
costume
bottle
green
with
yellow
facings
ornamented
with
a
huge
seal
of
silver
and
enamel
the
recollection
of
a
portrait
of
the
duke
de
morny
made
me
decide
on
or
and
the
further
chapters
of
this
story
will
show
that
i
was
not
far
wrong
the
count
made
me
sit
down
beside
him
one
of
his
first
questions
was
to
demand
if
i
ever
cut
fives
footnote
à
a
card
game
played
only
for
very
high
stakes
that
depends
on
how
i
feel
i
replied
well
said
i
have
not
done
so
since
i
swore
off
a
row
the
devil
of
a
party
one
day
at
walewski
i
cut
fives
naturally
i
was
worrying
any
the
other
had
a
four
cried
the
little
baron
de
chaux
gisseux
who
was
laying
staggering
sums
on
my
table
i
hurled
a
bottle
of
champagne
at
his
head
he
ducked
it
was
marshal
baillant
who
got
the
bottle
a
scene
the
matter
was
fixed
up
because
we
were
both
free
masons
the
emperor
made
me
promise
not
to
cut
fives
again
i
have
kept
my
promise
not
to
cut
fives
again
i
have
kept
my
promise
but
there
are
moments
when
it
is
hard
he
added
in
a
voice
steeped
in
melancholy
try
a
little
of
this
ahaggar
excellent
vintage
it
is
i
lieutenant
who
instructed
these
people
in
the
uses
of
the
juice
of
the
vine
the
vine
of
the
palm
trees
is
very
good
when
it
is
properly
fermented
but
it
gets
insipid
in
the
long
run
it
was
powerful
that
ahaggar
we
sipped
it
from
large
silver
goblets
it
was
fresh
as
rhine
wine
dry
as
the
wine
of
the
hermitage
and
then
suddenly
it
brought
back
recollections
of
the
burning
wines
of
portugal
it
seemed
sweet
fruity
an
admirable
wine
i
tell
you
that
wine
crowned
the
most
perfect
of
luncheons
there
were
few
meats
to
be
sure
but
those
few
were
remarkably
seasoned
profusion
of
cakes
pancakes
served
with
honey
fragrant
fritters
of
sour
milk
and
dates
and
everywhere
in
great
enamel
platters
or
wicker
jars
fruit
masses
of
fruit
figs
dates
pistachios
jujubes
pomegranates
apricots
huge
bunches
of
grapes
larger
than
those
which
bent
the
shoulders
of
the
hebrews
in
the
land
of
canaan
heavy
watermelons
cut
in
two
showing
their
moist
red
pulp
and
their
rows
of
black
seeds
i
had
scarcely
finished
one
of
these
beautiful
iced
fruits
when
le
mesge
rose
gentlemen
if
you
are
ready
he
said
to
morhange
and
me
get
away
from
that
old
dotard
as
soon
as
you
can
whispered
the
hetman
of
jitomir
to
me
the
party
of
et
will
begin
soon
you
shall
see
you
shall
see
we
go
it
even
harder
than
at
cora
pearl
gentlemen
repeated
le
mesge
in
his
dry
tone
we
followed
him
when
the
three
of
us
were
back
again
in
the
library
he
said
addressing
me
you
sir
asked
a
little
while
ago
what
occult
power
holds
you
here
your
manner
was
threatening
and
i
should
have
refused
to
comply
had
it
not
been
for
your
friend
whose
knowledge
enables
him
to
appreciate
better
than
you
the
value
of
the
revelations
i
am
about
to
make
to
you
he
touched
a
spring
in
the
side
of
the
wall
a
cupboard
appeared
stuffed
with
books
he
took
one
you
are
both
of
you
continued
le
mesge
in
the
power
of
a
woman
this
woman
the
sultaness
the
queen
the
absolute
sovereign
of
ahaggar
is
called
antinea
do
start
morhange
you
will
soon
understand
he
opened
the
book
and
read
this
sentence
must
warn
you
before
i
take
up
the
subject
matter
do
not
be
surprised
to
hear
me
call
the
barbarians
by
greek
names
what
is
that
book
stammered
morhange
whose
pallor
terrified
me
this
book
le
mesge
replied
very
slowly
weighing
his
words
with
an
extraordinary
expression
of
triumph
is
the
greatest
the
most
beautiful
the
most
secret
of
the
dialogues
of
plato
it
is
the
critias
of
atlantis
the
critias
but
it
is
unfinished
murmured
morhange
it
is
unfinished
in
france
in
europe
everywhere
else
said
le
mesge
but
it
is
finished
here
look
for
yourself
at
this
copy
but
what
connection
repeated
morhange
while
his
eyes
traveled
avidly
over
the
pages
what
connection
can
there
be
between
this
dialogue
complete
yes
it
seems
to
me
complete
what
connection
with
this
woman
antinea
why
should
it
be
in
her
possession
because
replied
the
little
man
imperturbably
this
book
is
her
patent
of
nobility
her
de
in
a
sense
do
you
understand
because
it
established
her
prodigious
genealogy
because
she
is
because
she
is
repeated
morhange
because
she
is
the
grand
daughter
of
neptune
the
last
descendant
of
the
atlantides
ix
atlantis
le
mesge
looked
at
morhange
triumphantly
it
was
evident
that
he
addressed
himself
exclusively
to
morhange
considering
him
alone
worthy
of
his
confidences
there
have
been
many
sir
he
said
both
french
and
foreign
officers
who
have
been
brought
here
at
the
caprice
of
our
sovereign
antinea
you
are
the
first
to
be
honored
by
my
disclosures
but
you
were
the
pupil
of
berlioux
and
i
owe
so
much
to
the
memory
of
that
great
man
that
it
seems
to
me
i
may
do
him
homage
by
imparting
to
one
of
his
disciples
the
unique
results
of
my
private
research
he
struck
the
bell
ferradji
appeared
coffee
for
these
gentlemen
ordered
le
mesge
he
handed
us
a
box
gorgeously
decorated
in
the
most
flaming
colors
full
of
egyptian
cigarettes
i
never
smoke
he
explained
but
antinea
sometimes
comes
here
these
are
her
cigarettes
help
yourselves
gentlemen
i
have
always
had
a
horror
of
that
pale
tobacco
which
gives
a
barber
of
the
rue
de
la
michodière
the
illusion
of
oriental
voluptuousness
but
in
their
way
these
cigarettes
were
not
bad
and
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
used
up
my
stock
of
caporal
here
are
the
back
numbers
of
vie
said
le
mesge
to
me
amuse
yourself
with
them
if
you
like
while
i
talk
to
your
friend
sir
i
replied
brusquely
it
is
true
that
i
never
studied
with
berlioux
nevertheless
you
must
allow
me
to
listen
to
your
conversation
i
shall
hope
to
find
something
in
it
to
amuse
me
as
you
wish
said
the
little
old
man
we
settled
ourselves
comfortably
le
mesge
sat
down
before
the
desk
shot
his
cuffs
and
commenced
as
follows
however
much
gentlemen
i
prize
complete
objectivity
in
matters
of
erudition
i
can
not
utterly
detach
my
own
history
from
that
of
the
last
descendant
of
clito
and
neptune
i
am
the
creation
of
my
own
efforts
from
my
childhood
the
prodigious
impulse
given
to
the
science
of
history
by
the
nineteenth
century
has
affected
me
i
saw
where
my
way
led
i
have
followed
it
in
spite
of
everything
in
spite
of
everything
everything
i
mean
it
literally
with
no
other
resources
than
my
own
work
and
merit
i
was
received
as
fellow
of
history
and
geography
at
the
examination
of
a
great
examination
among
the
thirteen
who
were
accepted
there
were
names
which
have
since
become
illustrious
julian
bourgeois
auerbach
i
do
not
envy
my
colleagues
on
the
summits
of
their
official
honors
i
read
their
works
with
commiseration
and
the
pitiful
errors
to
which
they
are
condemned
by
the
insufficiency
of
their
documents
would
amply
counterbalance
my
chagrin
and
fill
me
with
ironic
joy
had
i
not
been
raised
long
since
above
the
satisfaction
of
when
i
was
professor
at
the
lycée
du
parc
at
lyons
i
knew
berlioux
and
followed
eagerly
his
works
on
african
history
i
had
at
that
time
a
very
original
idea
for
my
doctor
thesis
i
was
going
to
establish
a
parallel
between
the
berber
heroine
of
the
seventh
century
who
struggled
against
the
arab
invader
kahena
and
the
french
heroine
joan
of
arc
who
struggled
against
the
english
invader
i
proposed
to
the
des
at
paris
this
title
for
my
thesis
of
arc
and
the
this
simple
announcement
gave
rise
to
a
perfect
outcry
in
learned
circles
a
furor
of
ridicule
my
friends
warned
me
discreetly
i
refused
to
believe
them
finally
i
was
forced
to
believe
when
my
rector
summoned
me
before
him
and
after
manifesting
an
astonishing
interest
in
my
health
asked
whether
i
should
object
to
taking
two
years
leave
on
half
pay
i
refused
indignantly
the
rector
did
not
insist
but
fifteen
days
later
a
ministerial
decree
with
no
other
legal
procedure
assigned
me
to
one
of
the
most
insignificant
and
remote
lycées
of
france
at
realize
my
exasperation
and
you
will
excuse
the
excesses
to
which
i
delivered
myself
in
that
strange
country
what
is
there
to
do
in
landes
if
you
neither
eat
nor
drink
i
did
both
violently
my
pay
melted
away
in
in
woodcocks
in
fine
wines
the
result
came
quickly
enough
in
less
than
a
year
my
joints
began
to
crack
like
the
axle
of
a
bicycle
that
has
gone
a
long
way
upon
a
dusty
track
a
sharp
attack
of
gout
nailed
me
to
my
bed
fortunately
in
that
blessed
country
the
cure
is
in
reach
of
the
suffering
so
i
departed
to
dax
at
vacation
time
to
try
the
waters
i
rented
a
room
on
the
bank
of
the
adour
overlooking
the
des
a
charwoman
took
care
of
it
for
me
she
worked
also
for
an
old
gentleman
a
retired
examining
magistrate
president
of
the
society
which
was
a
vague
scientific
backwater
in
which
the
scholars
of
the
neighborhood
applied
themselves
with
prodigious
incompetence
to
the
most
whimsical
subjects
one
afternoon
i
stayed
in
my
room
on
account
of
a
very
heavy
rain
the
good
woman
was
energetically
polishing
the
copper
latch
of
my
door
she
used
a
paste
called
tripoli
which
she
spread
upon
a
paper
and
rubbed
and
rubbed
the
peculiar
appearance
of
the
paper
made
me
curious
i
glanced
at
it
heavens
where
did
you
get
this
paper
she
was
perturbed
my
master
he
has
lots
of
it
i
tore
this
out
of
a
notebook
are
ten
francs
go
and
get
me
the
notebook
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
was
back
with
it
by
good
luck
it
lacked
only
one
page
the
one
with
which
she
had
been
polishing
my
door
this
manuscript
this
notebook
have
you
any
idea
what
it
was
merely
the
to
of
the
mythologist
denis
de
milet
which
is
mentioned
by
diodorus
and
the
loss
of
which
i
had
so
often
heard
berlioux
deplore
footnote
how
did
the
to
arrive
at
dax
i
have
found
so
far
only
one
credible
hypothesis
it
might
have
been
discovered
in
africa
by
the
traveller
de
behagle
a
member
of
the
society
who
studied
at
the
college
of
dax
and
later
on
several
occasions
visited
the
town
note
by
m
leroux
this
inestimable
document
contained
numerous
quotations
from
the
critias
it
gave
an
abstract
of
the
illustrious
dialogue
the
sole
existing
copy
of
which
you
held
in
your
hands
a
little
while
ago
it
established
past
controversy
the
location
of
the
stronghold
of
the
atlantides
and
demonstrated
that
this
site
which
is
denied
by
science
was
not
submerged
by
the
waves
as
is
supposed
by
the
rare
and
timorous
defenders
of
the
atlantide
hypothesis
he
called
it
the
mazycian
range
you
know
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
the
identification
of
the
mazyces
of
herodotus
with
the
people
of
imoschaoch
the
tuareg
but
the
manuscript
of
denys
unquestionably
identifies
the
historical
mazyces
with
the
atlantides
of
the
supposed
legend
i
learned
therefore
from
denys
not
only
that
the
central
part
of
atlantis
the
cradle
and
home
of
the
dynasty
of
neptune
had
not
sunk
in
the
disaster
described
by
plato
as
engulfing
the
rest
of
the
atlantide
isle
but
also
that
it
corresponded
to
the
tuareg
ahaggar
and
that
in
this
ahaggar
at
least
in
his
time
the
noble
dynasty
of
neptune
was
supposed
to
be
still
existent
the
historians
of
atlantis
put
the
date
of
the
cataclysm
which
destroyed
all
or
part
of
that
famous
country
at
nine
thousand
years
before
christ
if
denis
de
milet
who
wrote
scarcely
three
thousand
years
ago
believed
that
in
his
time
the
dynastic
issue
of
neptune
was
still
ruling
its
dominion
you
will
understand
that
i
thought
immediately
what
has
lasted
nine
thousand
years
may
last
eleven
thousand
from
that
instant
i
had
only
one
aim
to
find
the
possible
descendants
of
the
atlantides
and
since
i
had
many
reasons
for
supposing
them
to
be
debased
and
ignorant
of
their
original
splendor
to
inform
them
of
their
illustrious
descent
you
will
easily
understand
that
i
imparted
none
of
my
intentions
to
my
superiors
at
the
university
to
solicit
their
approval
or
even
their
permission
considering
the
attitude
they
had
taken
toward
me
would
have
been
almost
certainly
to
invite
confinement
in
a
cell
so
i
raised
what
i
could
on
my
own
account
and
departed
without
trumpet
or
drum
for
oran
on
the
first
of
october
i
reached
stretched
at
my
ease
beneath
a
palm
tree
at
the
oasis
i
took
infinite
pleasure
in
considering
how
that
very
day
the
principal
of
beside
himself
struggling
to
control
twenty
horrible
urchins
howling
before
the
door
of
an
empty
class
room
would
be
telegraphing
wildly
in
all
directions
in
search
of
his
lost
history
professor
le
mesge
stopped
and
looked
at
us
to
mark
his
satisfaction
i
admit
that
i
forgot
my
dignity
and
i
forgot
the
affectation
he
had
steadily
assumed
of
talking
only
to
morhange
you
will
pardon
me
sir
if
your
discourse
interests
me
more
than
i
had
anticipated
but
you
know
very
well
that
i
lack
the
fundamental
instruction
necessary
to
understand
you
you
speak
of
the
dynasty
of
neptune
what
is
this
dynasty
from
which
i
believe
you
trace
the
descent
of
antinea
what
is
her
rôle
in
the
story
of
atlantis
le
mesge
smiled
with
condescension
meantime
winking
at
morhange
with
the
eye
nearest
to
him
morhange
was
listening
without
expression
without
a
word
chin
in
hand
elbow
on
knee
plato
will
answer
for
me
sir
said
the
professor
and
he
added
with
an
accent
of
inexpressible
pity
is
it
really
possible
that
you
have
never
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
introduction
to
the
critias
he
placed
on
the
table
the
book
by
which
morhange
had
been
so
strangely
moved
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
began
to
read
it
seemed
as
if
the
magic
of
plato
vibrated
through
and
transfigured
this
ridiculous
little
old
man
drawn
by
lot
the
different
parts
of
the
earth
the
gods
obtained
some
a
larger
and
some
a
smaller
share
it
was
thus
that
neptune
having
received
in
the
division
the
isle
of
atlantis
came
to
place
the
children
he
had
had
by
a
mortal
in
one
part
of
that
isle
it
was
not
far
from
the
sea
a
plain
situated
in
the
midst
of
the
isle
the
most
beautiful
and
they
say
the
most
fertile
of
plains
about
fifty
stades
from
that
plain
in
the
middle
of
the
isle
was
a
mountain
there
dwelt
one
of
those
men
who
in
the
very
beginning
was
born
of
the
earth
evenor
with
his
wife
leucippe
they
had
only
one
daughter
clito
she
was
marriageable
when
her
mother
and
father
died
and
neptune
being
enamored
of
her
married
her
neptune
fortified
the
mountain
where
she
dwelt
by
isolating
it
he
made
alternate
girdles
of
sea
and
land
the
one
smaller
the
others
greater
two
of
earth
and
three
of
water
and
centered
them
round
the
isle
in
such
a
manner
that
they
were
at
all
parts
equally
distant
le
mesge
broke
off
his
reading
does
this
arrangement
recall
nothing
to
you
he
queried
morhange
morhange
i
stammered
you
remember
our
route
yesterday
our
abduction
the
two
corridors
that
we
had
to
cross
before
arriving
at
this
mountain
the
girdles
of
earth
and
of
water
two
tunnels
two
enclosures
of
earth
ha
ha
chuckled
le
mesge
he
smiled
as
he
looked
at
me
i
understood
that
this
smile
meant
can
he
be
less
obtuse
than
i
had
supposed
as
if
with
a
mighty
effort
morhange
broke
the
silence
i
understand
well
enough
i
understand
the
three
girdles
of
water
but
then
you
are
supposing
sir
an
explanation
the
ingeniousness
of
which
i
do
not
contest
you
are
supposing
the
exact
hypothesis
of
the
saharan
sea
i
suppose
it
and
i
can
prove
it
replied
the
irascible
little
old
chap
banging
his
fist
on
the
table
i
know
well
enough
what
schirmer
and
the
rest
have
advanced
against
it
i
know
it
better
than
you
do
i
know
all
about
it
sir
i
can
present
all
the
proofs
for
your
consideration
and
in
the
meantime
this
evening
at
dinner
you
will
no
doubt
enjoy
some
excellent
fish
and
you
will
tell
me
if
these
fish
caught
in
the
lake
that
you
can
see
from
this
window
seem
to
you
fresh
water
fish
you
must
realize
he
continued
the
mistake
of
those
who
believing
in
atlantis
have
sought
to
explain
the
cataclysm
in
which
they
suppose
the
island
to
have
sunk
without
exception
they
have
thought
that
it
was
swallowed
up
actually
there
has
not
been
an
immersion
there
has
been
an
emersion
new
lands
have
emerged
from
the
atlantic
wave
the
desert
has
replaced
the
sea
the
the
salt
lakes
the
triton
lakes
the
sandy
syrtes
are
the
desolate
vestiges
of
the
free
sea
water
over
which
in
former
days
the
fleets
swept
with
a
fair
wind
towards
the
conquest
of
attica
sand
swallows
up
civilization
better
than
water
there
remains
nothing
of
the
beautiful
isle
that
the
sea
and
winds
kept
gay
and
verdant
but
this
chalky
mass
nothing
has
endured
in
this
rocky
basin
cut
off
forever
from
the
living
world
but
the
marvelous
oasis
that
you
have
at
your
feet
these
red
fruits
this
cascade
this
blue
lake
sacred
witnesses
to
the
golden
age
that
is
gone
last
evening
in
coming
here
you
had
to
cross
the
five
enclosures
the
three
belts
of
water
dry
forever
the
two
girdles
of
earth
through
which
are
hollowed
the
passages
you
traversed
on
camel
back
where
formerly
the
triremes
floated
the
only
thing
that
in
this
immense
catastrophe
has
preserved
its
likeness
to
its
former
state
is
this
mountain
the
mountain
where
neptune
shut
up
his
clito
the
daughter
of
evenor
and
leucippe
the
mother
of
atlas
and
the
ancestress
of
antinea
the
sovereign
under
whose
dominion
you
are
about
to
enter
forever
sir
morhange
with
the
most
exquisite
courtesy
it
would
be
only
a
natural
anxiety
which
would
urge
us
to
inquire
the
reasons
and
the
end
of
this
dominion
but
behold
to
what
extent
your
revelation
interests
me
i
defer
this
question
of
private
interest
of
late
in
two
caverns
it
has
been
my
fortune
to
discover
tifinar
inscriptions
of
this
name
antinea
my
comrade
is
witness
that
i
took
it
for
a
greek
name
i
understand
now
thanks
to
you
and
the
divine
plato
that
i
need
no
longer
feel
surprised
to
hear
a
barbarian
called
by
a
greek
name
but
i
am
no
less
perplexed
as
to
the
etymology
of
the
word
can
you
enlighten
me
i
shall
certainly
not
fail
you
there
sir
said
le
mesge
i
may
tell
you
too
that
you
are
not
the
first
to
put
to
me
that
question
most
of
the
explorers
that
i
have
seen
enter
here
in
the
past
ten
years
have
been
attracted
in
the
same
way
intrigued
by
this
greek
work
reproduced
in
tifinar
i
have
even
arranged
a
fairly
exact
catalogue
of
these
inscriptions
and
the
caverns
where
they
are
to
be
met
with
all
or
almost
all
are
accompanied
by
this
legend
here
commences
her
i
myself
have
had
repainted
with
ochre
such
as
were
beginning
to
be
effaced
but
to
return
to
what
i
was
telling
you
before
none
of
the
europeans
who
have
followed
this
epigraphic
mystery
here
have
kept
their
anxiety
to
solve
this
etymology
once
they
found
themselves
in
antinea
palace
they
all
become
otherwise
preoccupied
i
might
make
many
disclosures
as
to
the
little
real
importance
which
purely
scientific
interests
possess
even
for
scholars
and
the
quickness
with
which
they
sacrifice
them
to
the
most
mundane
considerations
their
own
lives
for
instance
let
us
take
that
up
another
time
sir
if
it
is
satisfactory
to
you
said
morhange
always
admirably
polite
this
digression
had
only
one
point
sir
to
show
you
that
i
do
not
count
you
among
these
unworthy
scholars
you
are
really
eager
to
know
the
origin
of
this
name
and
that
before
knowing
what
kind
of
woman
it
belongs
to
and
her
motives
for
holding
you
and
this
gentleman
as
her
prisoners
i
stared
hard
at
the
little
old
man
but
he
spoke
with
profound
seriousness
so
much
the
better
for
you
my
boy
i
thought
otherwise
it
would
have
taken
me
long
to
send
you
through
the
window
to
air
your
ironies
at
your
ease
the
law
of
gravity
ought
not
to
be
here
at
ahaggar
you
no
doubt
formulated
several
hypotheses
when
you
first
encountered
the
name
antinea
continued
le
mesge
imperturbable
under
my
fixed
gaze
addressing
himself
to
morhange
would
you
object
to
repeating
them
to
me
not
at
all
sir
said
morhange
and
very
composedly
he
enumerated
the
etymological
suggestions
i
have
given
previously
the
little
man
with
the
shirt
front
rubbed
his
hands
very
good
he
admitted
with
an
accent
of
intense
jubilation
amazingly
good
at
least
for
one
with
only
the
modicum
of
greek
that
you
possess
but
it
is
all
none
the
less
false
it
is
because
i
suspected
as
much
that
i
put
my
question
to
you
said
morhange
blandly
i
will
not
keep
you
longer
in
suspense
said
le
mesge
the
word
antinea
is
composed
as
follows
is
nothing
but
a
tifinar
addition
to
an
essentially
greek
name
is
the
berber
feminine
article
we
have
several
examples
of
this
combination
take
the
north
african
town
the
name
means
the
whole
from
and
from
greek
nap
so
signifies
the
new
from
and
from
greek
ea
and
the
prefix
queried
morhang
is
it
possible
sir
that
i
have
put
myself
to
the
trouble
of
talking
to
you
for
a
solid
hour
about
the
critias
with
such
trifling
effect
it
is
certain
that
the
prefix
alone
has
no
meaning
you
will
understand
that
it
has
one
when
i
tell
you
that
we
have
here
a
very
curious
case
of
apocope
you
must
not
read
you
must
read
has
been
lost
by
apocope
has
survived
to
sum
up
antinea
is
composed
in
the
following
manner
greek
and
its
meaning
new
is
dazzlingly
apparent
from
this
demonstration
i
looked
at
morhange
his
astonishment
was
without
bounds
the
berber
prefix
had
literally
stunned
him
have
you
had
occasion
sir
to
verify
this
very
ingenious
etymology
he
was
finally
able
to
gasp
out
you
have
only
to
glance
over
these
few
books
said
le
mesge
disdainfully
he
opened
successively
five
ten
twenty
cupboards
an
enormous
library
was
spread
out
to
our
view
everything
everything
it
is
all
here
murmured
morhange
with
an
astonishing
inflection
of
terror
and
admiration
everything
that
is
worth
consulting
at
any
rate
said
le
mesge
all
the
great
books
whose
loss
the
learned
world
deplores
and
how
has
it
happened
sir
you
distress
me
i
thought
you
familiar
with
certain
events
you
are
forgetting
then
the
passage
where
pliny
the
elder
speaks
of
the
library
of
carthage
and
the
treasures
which
were
accumulated
there
in
when
that
city
fell
under
the
blows
of
the
knave
scipio
the
incredible
collection
of
illiterates
who
bore
the
name
of
the
roman
senate
had
only
the
profoundest
contempt
for
these
riches
they
presented
them
to
the
native
kings
this
is
how
mantabal
received
this
priceless
heritage
it
was
transmitted
to
his
son
and
grandson
hiempsal
juba
i
juba
ii
the
husband
of
the
admirable
cleopatra
selene
the
daughter
of
the
great
cleopatra
and
mark
antony
cleopatra
selene
had
a
daughter
who
married
an
atlantide
king
this
is
how
antinea
the
daughter
of
neptune
counts
among
her
ancestors
the
immortal
queen
of
egypt
that
is
how
by
following
the
laws
of
inheritance
the
remains
of
the
library
of
carthage
enriched
by
the
remnants
of
the
library
of
alexandria
are
actually
before
your
eyes
science
fled
from
man
while
he
was
building
those
monstrous
babels
of
in
berlin
london
paris
science
was
taking
refuge
in
this
desert
corner
of
ahaggar
they
may
well
forge
their
hypotheses
back
there
based
on
the
loss
of
the
mysterious
works
of
antiquity
these
works
are
not
lost
they
are
here
they
are
here
the
hebrew
the
chaldean
the
assyrian
books
here
the
great
egyptian
traditions
which
inspired
solon
herodotus
and
plato
here
the
greek
mythologists
the
magicians
of
roman
africa
the
indian
mystics
all
the
treasures
in
a
word
for
the
lack
of
which
contemporary
dissertations
are
poor
laughable
things
believe
me
he
is
well
avenged
the
little
universitarian
whom
they
took
for
a
madman
whom
they
defied
i
have
lived
i
live
i
shall
live
in
a
perpetual
burst
of
laughter
at
their
false
and
garbled
erudition
and
when
i
shall
be
dead
error
thanks
to
the
jealous
precaution
of
neptune
taken
to
isolate
his
clito
from
the
rest
of
the
world
error
i
say
will
continue
to
reign
as
sovereign
mistress
over
their
pitiful
compositions
sir
said
morhange
in
grave
voice
you
have
just
affirmed
the
influence
of
egypt
on
the
civilizations
of
the
people
here
for
reasons
which
some
day
perhaps
i
shall
have
occasion
to
explain
to
you
i
would
like
to
have
proof
of
that
relationship
we
need
not
wait
for
that
sir
said
le
mesge
then
in
my
turn
i
advanced
two
words
if
you
please
sir
i
said
brutally
i
will
not
hide
from
you
that
these
historical
discussions
seem
to
me
absolutely
out
of
place
it
is
not
my
fault
if
you
have
had
trouble
with
the
university
and
if
you
are
not
at
the
college
of
france
or
elsewhere
for
the
moment
just
one
thing
concerns
me
to
know
just
what
this
lady
antinea
wants
with
us
my
comrade
would
like
to
know
her
relation
with
ancient
egypt
very
well
for
my
part
i
desire
above
everything
to
know
her
relations
with
the
government
of
algeria
and
the
arabian
bureau
le
mesge
gave
a
strident
laugh
i
am
going
to
give
you
an
answer
that
will
satisfy
you
both
he
replied
and
he
added
follow
me
it
is
time
that
you
should
learn
x
the
red
marble
hall
we
passed
through
an
interminable
series
of
stairs
and
corridors
following
le
mesge
you
lose
all
sense
of
direction
in
this
labyrinth
i
muttered
to
morhange
worse
still
you
will
lose
your
head
answered
my
companion
this
old
fool
is
certainly
very
learned
but
god
knows
what
he
is
driving
at
however
he
has
promised
that
we
are
soon
to
know
le
mesge
had
stopped
before
a
heavy
dark
door
all
incrusted
with
strange
symbols
turning
the
lock
with
difficulty
he
opened
it
enter
gentlemen
i
beg
you
he
said
a
gust
of
cold
air
struck
us
full
in
the
face
the
room
we
were
entering
was
chill
as
a
vault
at
first
the
darkness
allowed
me
to
form
no
idea
of
its
proportions
the
lighting
purposely
subdued
consisted
of
twelve
enormous
copper
lamps
placed
upon
the
ground
and
burning
with
brilliant
red
flames
as
we
entered
the
wind
from
the
corridor
made
the
flames
flicker
momentarily
casting
about
us
our
own
enlarged
and
misshapen
shadows
then
the
gust
died
down
and
the
flames
no
longer
flurried
again
licked
up
the
darkness
with
their
motionless
red
tongues
these
twelve
giant
lamps
each
one
about
ten
feet
high
were
arranged
in
a
kind
of
crown
the
diameter
of
which
must
have
been
about
fifty
feet
in
the
center
of
this
circle
was
a
dark
mass
all
streaked
with
trembling
red
reflections
when
i
drew
nearer
i
saw
it
was
a
bubbling
fountain
it
was
the
freshness
of
this
water
which
had
maintained
the
temperature
of
which
i
have
spoken
huge
seats
were
cut
in
the
central
rock
from
which
gushed
the
murmuring
shadowy
fountain
they
were
heaped
with
silky
cushions
twelve
incense
burners
within
the
circle
of
red
lamps
formed
a
second
crown
half
as
large
in
diameter
their
smoke
mounted
toward
the
vault
invisible
in
the
darkness
but
their
perfume
combined
with
the
coolness
and
sound
of
the
water
banished
from
the
soul
all
other
desire
than
to
remain
there
forever
le
mesge
made
us
sit
down
in
the
center
of
the
hall
on
the
cyclopean
seats
he
seated
himself
between
us
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
your
eyes
will
grow
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
i
noticed
that
he
spoke
in
a
hushed
voice
as
if
he
were
in
church
little
by
little
our
eyes
did
indeed
grow
used
to
the
red
light
only
the
lower
part
of
the
great
hall
was
illuminated
the
whole
vault
was
drowned
in
shadow
and
its
height
was
impossible
to
estimate
vaguely
i
could
perceive
overhead
a
great
smooth
gold
chandelier
flecked
like
everything
else
with
sombre
red
reflections
but
there
was
no
means
of
judging
the
length
of
the
chain
by
which
it
hung
from
the
dark
ceiling
the
marble
of
the
pavement
was
of
so
high
a
polish
that
the
great
torches
were
reflected
even
there
this
room
i
repeat
was
round
a
perfect
circle
of
which
the
fountain
at
our
backs
was
the
center
we
sat
facing
the
curving
walls
before
long
we
began
to
be
able
to
see
them
they
were
of
peculiar
construction
divided
into
a
series
of
niches
broken
ahead
of
us
by
the
door
which
had
just
opened
to
give
us
passage
behind
us
by
a
second
door
a
still
darker
hole
which
i
divined
in
the
darkness
when
i
turned
around
from
one
door
to
the
other
i
counted
sixty
niches
making
in
all
one
hundred
and
twenty
each
was
about
ten
feet
high
each
contained
a
kind
of
case
larger
above
than
below
closed
only
at
the
lower
end
in
all
these
cases
except
two
just
opposite
me
i
thought
i
could
discern
a
brilliant
shape
a
human
shape
certainly
something
like
a
statue
of
very
pale
bronze
in
the
arc
of
the
circle
before
me
i
counted
clearly
thirty
of
these
strange
statues
what
were
these
statues
i
wanted
to
see
i
rose
le
mesge
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
in
good
time
he
murmured
in
the
same
low
voice
all
in
good
time
the
professor
was
watching
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
the
hall
and
from
behind
which
we
could
hear
the
sound
of
footsteps
becoming
more
and
more
distinct
it
opened
quietly
to
admit
three
tuareg
slaves
two
of
them
were
carrying
a
long
package
on
their
shoulders
the
third
seemed
to
be
their
chief
at
a
sign
from
him
they
placed
the
package
on
the
ground
and
drew
out
from
one
of
the
niches
the
case
which
it
contained
you
may
approach
gentlemen
said
le
mesge
he
motioned
the
three
tuareg
to
withdraw
several
paces
you
asked
me
not
long
since
for
some
proof
of
the
egyptian
influence
on
this
country
said
le
mesge
what
do
you
say
to
that
case
to
begin
with
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
case
that
the
servants
had
deposited
upon
the
ground
after
they
took
it
from
its
niche
morhange
uttered
a
thick
cry
we
had
before
us
one
of
those
cases
designed
for
the
preservation
of
mummies
the
same
shiny
wood
the
same
bright
decorations
the
only
difference
being
that
here
tifinar
writing
replaced
the
hieroglyphics
the
form
narrow
at
the
base
broader
above
ought
to
have
been
enough
to
enlighten
us
i
have
already
said
that
the
lower
half
of
this
large
case
was
closed
giving
the
whole
structure
the
appearance
of
a
rectangular
wooden
shoe
le
mesge
knelt
and
fastened
on
the
lower
part
of
the
case
a
square
of
white
cardboard
a
large
label
that
he
had
picked
up
from
his
desk
a
few
minutes
before
on
leaving
the
library
you
may
read
he
said
simply
but
still
in
the
same
low
tone
i
knelt
also
for
the
light
of
the
great
candelabra
was
scarcely
sufficient
to
read
the
label
where
none
the
less
i
recognized
the
professor
handwriting
it
bore
these
few
words
in
a
large
round
hand
number
major
sir
archibald
russell
born
at
richmond
july
died
at
ahaggar
december
i
leapt
to
my
feet
major
russell
i
exclaimed
not
so
loud
not
so
loud
said
le
mesge
no
one
speaks
out
loud
here
the
major
russell
i
repeated
obeying
his
injunction
as
if
in
spite
of
myself
who
left
khartoum
last
year
to
explore
sokoto
the
same
replied
the
professor
and
where
is
major
russell
he
is
there
replied
le
mesge
the
professor
made
a
gesture
the
tuareg
approached
a
poignant
silence
reigned
in
the
mysterious
hall
broken
only
by
the
fresh
splashing
of
the
fountain
the
three
negroes
were
occupied
in
undoing
the
package
that
they
had
put
down
near
the
painted
case
weighed
down
with
wordless
horror
morhange
and
i
stood
watching
soon
a
rigid
form
a
human
form
appeared
a
red
gleam
played
over
it
we
had
before
us
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
a
statue
of
pale
bronze
wrapped
in
a
kind
of
white
veil
a
statue
like
those
all
around
us
upright
in
their
niches
it
seemed
to
fix
us
with
an
impenetrable
gaze
sir
archibald
russell
murmured
le
mesge
slowly
morhange
approached
speechless
but
strong
enough
to
lift
up
the
white
veil
for
a
long
long
time
he
gazed
at
the
sad
bronze
statue
a
mummy
a
mummy
he
said
finally
you
deceive
yourself
sir
this
is
no
mummy
accurately
speaking
no
replied
le
mesge
this
is
not
a
mummy
none
the
less
you
have
before
you
the
mortal
remains
of
sir
archibald
russell
i
must
point
out
to
you
here
my
dear
sir
that
the
processes
of
embalming
used
by
antinea
differ
from
the
processes
employed
in
ancient
egypt
here
there
is
no
natron
nor
bands
nor
spices
the
industry
of
ahaggar
in
a
single
effort
has
achieved
a
result
obtained
by
european
science
only
after
long
experiments
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
arrived
here
and
found
that
they
were
employing
a
method
i
supposed
known
only
to
the
civilized
world
le
mesge
struck
a
light
tap
with
his
finger
on
the
forehead
of
sir
archibald
russell
it
rang
like
metal
it
is
bronze
i
said
that
is
not
a
human
forehead
it
is
bronze
le
mesge
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
a
human
forehead
he
affirmed
curtly
and
not
bronze
bronze
is
darker
sir
this
is
the
great
unknown
metal
of
which
plato
speaks
in
the
critias
and
which
is
something
between
gold
and
silver
it
is
the
special
metal
of
the
mountains
of
the
atlantides
it
is
bending
again
i
satisfied
myself
that
this
metal
was
the
same
as
that
with
which
the
walls
of
the
library
were
overcast
it
is
orichalch
continued
le
mesge
you
look
as
if
you
had
no
idea
how
a
human
body
can
look
like
a
statue
of
orichalch
come
captain
morhange
you
whom
i
gave
credit
for
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
have
you
never
heard
of
the
method
of
variot
by
which
a
human
body
can
be
preserved
without
embalming
have
you
never
read
the
book
of
that
practitioner
he
explains
a
method
called
the
skin
is
coated
with
a
very
thin
layer
of
silver
salts
to
make
it
a
conductor
the
body
then
is
placed
in
a
solution
of
copper
sulphate
and
the
polar
currents
do
their
work
the
body
of
this
estimable
english
major
has
been
metalized
in
the
same
manner
except
that
a
solution
of
orichalch
sulphate
a
very
rare
substance
has
been
substituted
for
that
of
copper
sulphate
thus
instead
of
the
statue
of
a
poor
slave
a
copper
statue
you
have
before
you
a
statue
of
metal
more
precious
than
silver
or
gold
in
a
word
a
statue
worthy
of
the
granddaughter
of
neptune

waved
his
arm
the
black

seized
the
body
in
a
few
seconds
they
slid
the
orichalch
ghost
into
its
painted
wooden
sheath
that
was
set
on
end
and
slid
into
its
niche
beside
the
niche
where
an
exactly
similar
sheath
was
labelled
number
upon
finishing
their
task
they
retired
without
a
word
a
draught
of
cold
air
from
the
door
again
made
the
flames
of
the
copper
torches
flicker
and
threw
great
shadows
about
us
morhange
and
i
remained
as
motionless
as
the
pale
metal
specters
which
surrounded
us
suddenly
i
pulled
myself
together
and
staggered
forward
to
the
niche
beside
that
in
which
they
just
had
laid
the
remains
of
the
english

i
looked
for

louis

i
laid
my
forehead
against
the
cold
wall
and
with
shaking
shoulders
began
to
sob
i
heard
the
muffled
voice
of
morhange
speaking
to
the
professor
sir
this
has
lasted
long
enough
let
us
make
an
end
of
it
he
wanted
to
know
said
le

what
am
i
to
do
i
went
up
to
him
and
seized
his
shoulders
what
happened
to
him
what
did
he
die
of
just
like
the
others
the
professor
replied
just
like
lieutenant
woodhouse
like
captain
deligne
like
major

like
colonel
von
wittman
like
the
of
yesterday
and
all
those
of
of
what
did
they
die
morhange
demanded
imperatively
in
his
turn
the
professor
looked
at
morhange
i
saw
my
comrade
grow
pale
of
what
did
they
die
sir
died
of
and
he
added
in
a
very
low
very
grave
voice
now
you
know
gently
and
with
a
tact
which
we
should
hardly
have
suspected
in
him
le
mesge
drew
us
away
from
the
statues
a
moment
later
morhange
and
i
found
ourselves
again
seated
or
rather
sunk
among
the
cushions
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
invisible
fountain
murmured
its
plaint
at
our
feet
le
mesge
sat
between
us
now
you
know
he
repeated
you
know
but
you
do
not
yet
understand
then
very
slowly
he
said
you
are
as
they
have
been
the
prisoners
of
antinea
and
vengeance
is
due

vengeance
said
morhange
who
had
regained
his
for
what
i
beg
to
ask
what
have
the
lieutenant
and
i
done
to
atlantis
how
have
we
incurred
her
hatred
it
is
an
old
quarrel
a
very
old
quarrel
the
professor
replied
gravely
a
quarrel
which
long
antedates
you
m
morhange
explain
yourself
i
beg
of
you
professor
you
are
man
she
is
a
woman
said
the
dreamy
voice
of
le
mesge
the
whole
matter
lies
there
really
sir
i
do
not
see
we
do
not
see
you
are
going
to
understand
have
you
really
forgotten
to
what
an
extent
the
beautiful
queens
of
antiquity
had
just
cause
to
complain
of
the
strangers
whom
fortune
brought
to
their
borders
the
poet
victor
hugo
pictured
their
detestable
acts
well
enough
in
his
colonial
poem
called
fille
wherever
we
look
we
see
similar
examples
of
fraud
and
ingratitude
these
gentlemen
made
free
use
of
the
beauty
and
the
riches
of
the
lady
then
one
fine
morning
they
disappeared
she
was
indeed
lucky
if
her
lover
having
observed
the
position
carefully
did
not
return
with
ships
and
troops
of
occupation
your
learning
charms
me
said
morhange
continue
do
you
need
examples
alas
they
abound
think
of
the
cavalier
fashion
in
which
ulysses
treated
calypso

what
should
i
say
of

with
inconceivable

with
still
greater
brutality

undeserved
fashion

only
to

she
takes
what

can
give
her
she
lends
them
her

while
her

dominates

she
is
the

who
has
never

the
slave
of

even
for
a

she
has
never

to
regain
her
for
she
never
has
lost
it
she
is
the
only
woman
who
has
been
able
to
disassociate
those
two
inextricable
things
love
and
voluptuousness
le
mesge
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
once
every
day
she
comes
to
this
vault
she
stops
before
the
niches
she
meditates
before
the
rigid
statues
she
touches
the
cold
bosoms
so
burning
when
she
knew
them
then
after
dreaming
before
the
empty
niche
where
the
next
victim
soon
will
sleep
his
eternal
sleep
in
a
cold
case
of
orichalch
she
returns
nonchalantly
where
he
is
waiting
for
her
the
professor
stopped
speaking
the
fountain
again
made
itself
heard
in
the
midst
of
the
shadow
my
pulses
beat
my
head
seemed
on
fire
a
fever
was
consuming
me
and
all
of
them
i
cried
regardless
of
the
place
all
of
them
complied
they
submitted
well
she
has
only
to
come
and
she
will
see
what
will
happen
morhange
was
silent
my
dear
sir
said
le
mesge
in
a
very
gentle
voice
you
are
speaking
like
a
child
you
do
not
know
you
have
not
seen
antinea
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
that
among
those
and
with
a
sweeping
gesture
he
indicated
the
silent
circle
of
statues
there
were
men
as
courageous
as
you
and
perhaps
less
excitable
i
remember
one
of
them
especially
well
a
phlegmatic
englishman
who
now
is
resting
under
number
when
he
first
appeared
before
antinea
he
was
smoking
a
cigar
and
like
all
the
rest
he
bent
before
the
gaze
of
his
sovereign
do
not
speak
until
you
have
seen
her
a
university
training
hardly
fits
one
to
discourse
upon
matters
of
passion
and
i
feel
scarcely
qualified
myself
to
tell
you
what
antinea
is
i
only
affirm
this
that
when
you
have
seen
her
you
will
remember
nothing
else
family
country
honor
you
will
renounce
everything
for
her
everything
asked
morhange
in
a
calm
voice
everything
le
mesge
insisted
emphatically
you
will
forget
all
you
will
renounce
all
from
outside
a
faint
sound
came
to
us
le
mesge
consulted
his
watch
in
any
case
you
will
see
the
door
opened
a
tall
white
targa
the
tallest
we
had
yet
seen
in
this
remarkable
abode
entered
and
came
toward
us
he
bowed
and
touched
me
lightly
on
the
shoulder
follow
him
said
le
mesge
without
a
word
i
obeyed
xi
antinea
my
guide
and
i
passed
along
another
long
corridor
my
excitement
increased
i
was
impatient
for
one
thing
only
to
come
face
to
face
with
that
woman
to
tell
her
so
far
as
anything
else
was
concerned
i
already
was
done
for
i
was
mistaken
in
hoping
that
the
adventure
would
take
an
heroic
turn
at
once
in
real
life
these
contrasts
never
are
definitely
marked
out
i
should
have
remembered
from
many
past
incidents
that
the
burlesque
was
regularly
mixed
with
the
tragic
in
my
life
we
reached
a
little
transparent
door
my
guide
stood
aside
to
let
me
pass
i
found
myself
in
the
most
luxurious
of
a
ground
glass
ceiling
diffused
a
gay
rosy
light
over
the
marble
floor
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
a
clock
fastened
to
the
wall
in
place
of
the
figures
for
the
hours
were
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
the
small
hand
had
not
yet
reached
the
sign
of
capricorn
only
three
the
day
seemed
to
have
lasted
a
century
already
and
only
a
little
more
than
half
of
it
was
gone
another
idea
came
to
me
and
a
convulsive
laugh
bent
me
double
antinea
wants
me
to
be
at
my
best
when
i
meet
her
a
mirror
of
orichalch
formed
one
whole
side
of
the
room
glancing
into
it
i
realized
that
in
all
decency
there
was
nothing
exaggerated
in
the
demand
my
untrimmed
beard
the
frightful
layer
of
dirt
which
lay
about
my
eyes
and
furrowed
my
cheeks
my
clothing
spotted
by
all
the
clay
of
the
sahara
and
torn
by
all
the
thorns
of
ahaggar
all
this
made
me
appear
a
pitiable
enough
suitor
i
lost
no
time
in
undressing
and
plunging
into
the
porphry
bath
in
the
center
of
the
room
a
delicious
drowsiness
came
over
me
in
that
perfumed
water
a
thousand
little
jars
spread
on
a
costly
carved
wood
danced
before
my
eyes
they
were
of
all
sizes
and
colors
carved
in
a
very
transparent
kind
of
jade
the
warm
humidity
of
the
atmosphere
hastened
my
relaxation
i
still
had
strength
to
think
the
devil
take
atlantis
and
the
vault
and
le
mesge
then
i
fell
asleep
in
the
bath
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
the
little
hand
of
the
clock
had
almost
reached
the
sign
of
taurus
before
me
his
black
hands
braced
on
the
edge
of
the
bath
stood
a
huge
negro
and
his
forehead
bound
with
an
immense
orange
turban
he
looked
at
me
and
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
silent
laugh
who
is
this
fellow
the
negro
laughed
harder
without
saying
a
word
he
lifted
me
like
a
feather
out
of
the
perfumed
water
now
of
a
color
on
which
i
shall
not
dwell
in
no
time
at
all
i
was
stretched
out
on
an
inclined
marble
table
the
negro
began
to
massage
me
vigorously
more
gently
there
fellow
my
masseur
did
not
reply
but
laughed
and
rubbed
still
harder
where
do
you
come
from
kanem
torkou
you
laugh
too
much
for
a
targa
unbroken
silence
the
negro
was
as
speechless
as
he
was
hilarious
after
all
i
am
making
a
fool
of
myself
i
said
giving
up
the
case
such
as
he
is
he
is
more
agreeable
than
le
mesge
with
his
nightmarish
erudition
but
on
my
word
what
a
recruit
he
would
be
for
hamman
on
the
rue
des
mathurins
cigarette
sidi
without
awaiting
my
reply
he
placed
a
cigarette
between
my
lips
and
lighted
it
and
resumed
his
task
of
polishing
every
inch
of
me
he
does
talk
much
but
he
is
obliging
i
thought
and
i
sent
a
puff
of
smoke
into
his
face
this
pleasantry
seemed
to
delight
him
immensely
he
showed
his
pleasure
by
giving
me
great
slaps
when
he
had
dressed
me
down
sufficiently
he
took
a
little
jar
from
the
and
began
to
rub
me
with
a
ointment
weariness
seemed
to
fly
away
from
my
rejuvenated
muscles
a
stroke
on
a
copper
gong
my
masseur
disappeared
a
stunted
old
negress
entered
dressed
in
the
most
tawdry
tinsel
she
was
talkative
as
a
magpie
but
at
first
i
did
not
understand
a
word
in
the
interminable
string
she
unwound
while
she
took
first
my
hands
then
my
feet
and
polished
the
nails
with
determined
grimaces
another
stroke
on
the
gong
the
old
woman
gave
place
to
another
negro
grave
this
time
and
dressed
all
in
white
with
a
knitted
skull
cap
on
his
oblong
head
it
was
the
barber
and
a
remarkably
dexterous
one
he
quickly
trimmed
my
hair
and
on
my
word
it
was
well
done
then
without
asking
me
what
style
i
preferred
he
shaved
me
clean
i
looked
with
pleasure
at
my
face
once
more
visible
antinea
must
like
the
american
type
i
thought
what
an
affront
to
the
memory
of
her
worthy
grandfather
neptune
the
gay
negro
entered
and
placed
a
package
on
the
divan
the
barber
disappeared
i
was
somewhat
astonished
to
observe
that
the
package
which
my
new
valet
opened
carefully
contained
a
suit
of
white
flannels
exactly
like
those
french
officers
wear
in
algeria
in
summer
the
wide
trousers
seemed
made
to
my
measure
the
tunic
fitted
without
a
wrinkle
and
my
astonishment
was
unbounded
at
observing
that
it
even
had
two
gilt
the
insignia
of
my
rank
braided
on
the
cuffs
for
shoes
there
were
slippers
of
red
morocco
leather
with
gold
ornaments
the
underwear
all
of
silk
seemed
to
have
come
straight
from
the
rue
de
la
paix
dinner
was
excellent
i
murmured
looking
at
myself
in
the
mirror
with
satisfaction
the
apartment
is
perfectly
arranged
yes
but
i
could
not
repress
a
shudder
when
i
suddenly
recalled
that
room
of
red
marble
the
clock
struck
half
past
four
someone
rapped
gently
on
the
door
the
tall
white
targa
who
had
brought
me
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
stepped
forward
touched
me
on
the
arm
and
signed
for
me
to
follow
again
i
followed
him
we
passed
through
interminable
corridors
i
was
disturbed
but
the
warm
water
had
given
me
a
certain
feeling
of
detachment
and
above
all
more
than
i
wished
to
admit
i
had
a
growing
sense
of
lively
curiosity
if
at
that
moment
someone
had
offered
to
lead
me
back
to
the
route
across
the
white
plain
near
would
i
have
accepted
hardly
i
tried
to
feel
ashamed
of
my
curiosity
i
thought
of
maillefeu
he
too
followed
this
corridor
and
now
he
is
down
there
in
the
red
marble
hall
i
had
no
time
to
linger
over
this
reminiscence
i
was
suddenly
bowled
over
thrown
to
the
ground
as
if
by
a
sort
of
meteor
the
corridor
was
dark
i
could
see
nothing
i
heard
only
a
mocking
growl
the
white
targa
had
flattened
himself
back
against
the
wall
good
i
mumbled
picking
myself
up
the
deviltries
are
beginning
we
continued
on
our
way
a
glow
different
from
that
of
the
rose
night
lights
soon
began
to
light
up
the
corridor
we
reached
a
high
bronze
door
in
which
a
strange
lacy
design
had
been
cut
in
filigree
a
clear
gong
sounded
and
the
double
doors
opened
part
way
the
targa
remained
in
the
corridor
closing
the
doors
after
me
i
took
a
few
steps
forward
mechanically
then
paused
rooted
to
the
spot
and
rubbed
my
eyes
i
was
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
the
sky
several
hours
of
shaded
light
had
unaccustomed
me
to
daylight
it
poured
in
through
one
whole
side
of
the
huge
room
the
room
was
in
the
lower
part
of
this
mountain
which
was
more
honeycombed
with
corridors
and
passages
than
an
egyptian
pyramid
it
was
on
a
level
with
the
garden
which
i
had
seen
in
the
morning
from
the
balcony
and
seemed
to
be
a
continuation
of
it
the
carpet
extended
out
under
the
great
palm
trees
and
the
birds
flew
about
the
forest
of
pillars
in
the
room
by
contrast
the
half
of
the
room
untouched
by
direct
light
from
the
oasis
seemed
dark
the
sun
setting
behind
the
mountain
painted
the
garden
paths
with
rose
and
flamed
with
red
upon
the
traditional
flamingo
which
stood
with
one
foot
raised
at
the
edge
of
the
sapphire
lake
suddenly
i
was
bowled
over
a
second
time
i
felt
a
warm
silky
touch
a
burning
breath
on
my
neck
again
the
mocking
growl
which
had
so
disturbed
me
in
the
corridor
with
a
wrench
i
pulled
myself
free
and
sent
a
chance
blow
at
my
assailant
the
cry
this
time
of
pain
and
rage
broke
out
again
it
was
echoed
by
a
long
peal
of
laughter
furious
i
turned
to
look
for
the
insolent
onlooker
thinking
to
speak
my
mind
and
then
my
glance
stood
still
antinea
was
before
me
in
the
dimmest
part
of
the
room
under
a
kind
of
arch
lit
by
the
mauve
rays
from
a
dozen
four
women
lay
on
a
heap
of
cushions
and
rare
white
persian
rugs
i
recognized
the
first
three
as
tuareg
women
of
a
splendid
regular
beauty
dressed
in
magnificent
robes
of
white
silk
embroidered
in
gold
the
fourth
very
dark
skinned
almost
negroid
seemed
younger
a
tunic
of
red
silk
enhanced
the
dusk
of
her
face
her
arms
and
her
bare
feet
the
four
were
grouped
about
a
sort
of
throne
of
white
rugs
covered
with
a
gigantic
lion
skin
on
which
half
raised
on
one
elbow
lay
antinea
antinea
whenever
i
saw
her
after
that
i
wondered
if
i
had
really
looked
at
her
before
so
much
more
beautiful
did
i
find
her
more
beautiful
inadequate
word
inadequate
language
but
is
it
really
the
fault
of
the
language
or
of
those
who
abuse
the
word
one
could
not
stand
before
her
without
recalling
the
woman
for
whom
ephractoeus
overcame
atlas
of
her
for
whom
sapor
usurped
the
scepter
of
ozymandias
for
whom
mamylos
subjugated
susa
and
tentyris
for
whom
antony
fled

an
egyptian
fell
over
her
abundant
curls
its
two
points
of
heavy
cloth
extended
to
her
slim
hips
the
golden
serpent
was
clasped
about
her
little
round
determined
forehead
darting
its
double
tongue
of
rubies
over
her
head
she
wore
a
tunic
of
black
chiffon
shot
with
gold
very
light
very
full
slightly
gathered
in
by
a
white
muslin
scarf
embroidered
with
iris
in
black
pearls
that
was
antinea
costume
but
what
was
she
beneath
all
this
a
slim
young
girl
with
long
green
eyes
and
the
slender
profile
of
a
hawk
a
more
intense
adonis
a
child
queen
of
sheba
but
with
a
look
a
smile
such
as
no
oriental
ever
had
a
miracle
of
irony
and
freedom
i
did
not
see
her
body
indeed
i
should
not
have
thought
of
looking
at
it
had
i
had
the
strength
and
that
perhaps
was
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
that
first
impression
in
that
unforgettable
moment
nothing
would
have
seemed
to
me
more
horribly
sacrilegious
than
to
think
of
the
fifty
victims
in
the
red
marble
hall
of
the
fifty
young
men
who
had
held
that
slender
body
in
their
arms
she
was
still
laughing
at
me
king
hiram
she
called
i
turned
and
saw
my
enemy
on
the
capital
of
one
of
the
columns
twenty
feet
above
the
floor
a
splendid
leopard
was
crouched
he
still
looked
surly
from
the
blow
i
had
dealt
him
king
hiram
antinea
repeated
come
here
the
beast
relaxed
like
a
spring
released
he
fawned
at
his
feet
i
saw
his
red
tongue
licking
her
bare
little
ankles
ask
the
gentleman
pardon
she
said
the
leopard
looked
at
me
spitefully
the
yellow
skin
of
his
muzzle
puckered
about
his
black
moustache
fftt
he
grumbled
like
a
great
cat
go
antinea
ordered
imperiously
the
beast
crawled
reluctantly
toward
me
he
laid
his
head
humbly
between
his
paws
and
waited
i
stroked
his
beautiful
spotted
forehead
you
must
not
be
vexed
said
antinea
he
is
always
that
way
with
strangers
then
he
must
often
be
in
bad
humor
i
said
simply
those
were
my
first
words
they
brought
a
smile
to
antinea
lips
she
gave
me
a
long
quiet
look
aguida
she
said
to
one
of
the
targa
women
you
will
give
pounds
in
gold
to
you
are
a
lieutenant
she
asked
after
a
pause
yes
where
do
you
come
from
from
france
i
might
have
guessed
that
she
said
ironically
but
from
what
part
of
france
from
what
we
call
the
from
what
town
from
duras
she
reflected
a
moment
duras
there
is
a
little
river
there
the
dropt
and
a
fine
old
château
you
know
duras
i
murmured
amazed
you
go
there
from
bordeaux
by
a
little
branch
railway
she
went
on
it
is
a
road
with
hills
crowned
by
the
feudal
ruins
the
villages
have
beautiful
names
monségur
la
tresne
créon
créon
as
in
antigone
you
have
been
there
she
looked
at
me
do
speak
so
coldly
she
said
sooner
or
later
we
will
be
intimate
and
you
may
as
well
lay
aside
formality
now
this
threatening
promise
suddenly
filled
me
with
great
happiness
i
thought
of
le
mesge
words
do
talk
until
you
have
seen
her
when
you
have
seen
her
you
will
renounce
everything
for
her
have
i
been
in
duras
she
went
on
with
a
burst
of
laughter
you
are
joking
imagine
neptune
granddaughter
in
the
compartment
of
a
local
train
she
pointed
to
an
enormous
white
rock
which
towered
above
the
palm
trees
of
the
garden
that
is
my
horizon
she
said
gravely
she
picked
up
one
of
several
books
which
lay
scattered
about
her
on
the
lion
skin
the
time
table
of
the
de
fer
de
she
said
admirable
reading
for
one
who
never
budges
here
it
is
five
in
the
afternoon
a
train
a
local
arrived
three
minutes
ago
at
surgères
in
the
it
will
start
on
in
six
minutes
in
two
hours
it
will
reach
la
rochelle
how
strange
it
seems
to
think
of
such
things
here
so
far
away
so
much
commotion
there
here
nothing
changes
you
speak
french
well
i
said
she
gave
a
little
nervous
laugh
i
have
to
and
german
too
and
italian
and
english
and
spanish
my
way
of
living
has
made
me
a
great
polygot
but
i
prefer
french
even
to
tuareg
and
arabian
it
seems
as
if
i
had
always
known
it
and
i
am
not
saying
that
to
please
you
there
was
a
pause
i
thought
of
her
grandmother
of
whom
plutarch
said
there
were
few
races
with
which
she
needed
an
interpreter
cleopatra
spoke
their
own
language
to
the
ethiopians
to
the
troglodytes
the
hebrews
the
arabs
the
medes
and
the
persians
do
not
stand
rooted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
you
worry
me
come
sit
here
beside
me
move
over
king
hiram
the
leopard
obeyed
with
good
temper
beside
her
was
an
onyx
bowl
she
took
from
it
a
perfectly
plain
ring
of
orichalch
and
slipped
it
on
my
left
i
saw
that
she
wore
one
like
it
give
monsieur
de
a
rose
sherbet
the
dark
girl
in
red
silk
obeyed
my
private
secretary
said
antinea
introducing
her
mademoiselle
of
gâo
on
the
niger
her
family
is
almost
as
ancient
as
mine
as
she
spoke
she
looked
at
me
her
green
eyes
seemed
to
be
appraising
me
and
your
comrade
the
captain
she
asked
in
a
dreamy
tone
i
have
not
yet
seen
him
what
is
he
like
does
he
resemble
you
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
entered
i
thought
of
morhange
i
did
not
answer
antinea
smiled
she
stretched
herself
out
full
length
on
the
lion
skin
her
bare
right
knee
slipped
out
from
under
her
tunic
it
is
time
to
go
find
him
she
said
languidly
you
will
soon
receive
my
orders
show
him
the
way
first
take
him
to
his
room
he
can
not
have
seen
it
i
rose
and
lifted
her
hand
to
my
lips
she
struck
me
with
it
so
sharply
as
to
make
my
lips
bleed
as
if
to
brand
me
as
her
possession
i
was
in
the
dark
corridor
again
the
young
girl
in
the
red
silk
tunic
walked
ahead
of
me
here
is
your
room
she
said
if
you
wish
i
will
take
you
to
the
the
others
are
about
to
meet
there
for
dinner
she
spoke
an
adorable
lisping
french
no
i
would
rather
stay
here
this
evening
i
am
not
hungry
i
am
tired
you
remember
my
name
she
said
she
seemed
proud
of
it
i
felt
that
in
her
i
had
an
ally
in
case
of
need
i
remember
your
name
because
it
is
beautiful
footnote
in
berber
tanit
means
a
spring
zerga
is
the
feminine
of
the
adjective
azreg
blue
note
by
m
leroux
then
i
added
now
leave
me
little
one
i
want
to
be
alone
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
go
i
was
touched
but
at
the
same
time
vexed
i
felt
a
great
need
of
withdrawing
into
myself
my
room
is
above
yours
she
said
there
is
a
copper
gong
on
the
table
here
you
have
only
to
strike
if
you
want
anything
a
white
targa
will
answer
for
a
second
these
instructions
amused
me
i
was
in
a
hotel
in
the
midst
of
the
sahara
i
had
only
to
ring
for
service
i
looked
about
my
room
my
room
for
how
long
it
was
fairly
large
cushions
a
couch
an
alcove
cut
into
the
rock
all
lighted
by
a
great
window
covered
by
a
matting
shade
i
went
to
the
window
and
raised
the
shade
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
entered
i
leaned
my
elbows
on
the
rocky
sill
inexpressible
emotion
filled
my
heart
the
window
faced
south
it
was
about
two
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
the
black
polished
volcanic
wall
yawned
dizzily
below
me
in
front
of
me
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
away
was
another
wall
the
first
enclosure
mentioned
in
the
critias
and
beyond
it
in
the
distance
i
saw
the
limitless
red
desert
xii
morhange
disappears
my
fatigue
was
so
great
that
i
lay
as
if
unconscious
until
the
next
day
i
awoke
about
three
in
the
afternoon
i
thought
at
once
of
the
events
of
the
previous
day
they
seemed
amazing
let
me
see
i
said
to
myself
let
us
work
this
out
i
must
begin
by
consulting
morhange
i
was
ravenously
hungry
the
gong
which
had
pointed
out
lay
within
arm
reach
i
struck
it
a
white
targa
appeared
show
me
the
way
to
the
library
i
ordered
he
obeyed
as
we
wound
our
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
stairs
and
corridors
i
realized
that
i
could
never
have
found
my
way
without
his
help
morhange
was
in
the
library
intently
reading
a
manuscript
a
lost
treatise
of
saint
optat
he
said
oh
if
only
dom
granger
were
here
see
it
is
written
in
characters
i
did
not
reply
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
an
object
which
lay
on
the
table
beside
the
manuscript
it
was
an
orichalch
ring
exactly
like
that
which
antinea
had
given
me
the
previous
day
and
the
one
which
she
herself
wore
morhange
smiled
well
i
said
well
you
have
seen
her
i
have
indeed
morhange
replied
she
is
beautiful
is
she
not
it
would
be
difficult
to
dispute
that
my
comrade
answered
i
even
believe
that
i
can
say
that
she
is
as
intelligent
as
she
is
beautiful
there
was
a
pause
morhange
was
calmly
fingering
the
orichalch
ring
you
know
what
our
fate
is
to
be
i
know
le
mesge
explained
it
to
us
yesterday
in
polite
mythological
terms
this
evidently
is
an
extraordinary
adventure
he
was
silent
then
said
looking
at
me
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
dragged
you
here
the
only
mitigating
feature
is
that
since
last
evening
you
seem
to
have
been
bearing
your
lot
very
easily
where
had
morhange
learned
this
insight
into
the
human
heart
i
did
not
reply
thus
giving
him
the
best
of
proofs
that
he
had
judged
correctly
what
do
you
think
of
doing
i
finally
murmured
he
rolled
up
the
manuscript
leaned
back
comfortably
in
his
armchair
and
lit
a
cigar
i
have
thought
it
over
carefully
with
the
aid
of
my
conscience
i
have
marked
out
a
line
of
conduct
the
matter
is
clear
and
admits
no
discussion
the
question
is
not
quite
the
same
for
me
as
for
you
because
of
my
character
which
i
admit
has
set
out
on
a
rather
doubtful
adventure
to
be
sure
i
have
not
taken
holy
orders
but
even
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
ninth
commandment
itself
forbids
my
having
relations
with
a
woman
not
my
wife
i
admit
that
i
have
no
taste
for
the
kind
of
forced
servitude
for
which
the
excellent
has
so
kindly
recruited
us
that
granted
the
fact
remains
that
my
life
is
not
my
own
with
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
as
might
a
private
explorer
travelling
at
his
own
expenses
and
for
his
own
ends
i
have
a
mission
to
accomplish
results
to
obtain
if
i
could
regain
my
liberty
by
paying
the
singular
ransom
which
this
country
exacts
i
should
consent
to
give
satisfaction
to
antinea
according
to
my
ability
i
know
the
tolerance
of
the
church
and
especially
that
of
the
order
to
which
i
aspire
such
a
procedure
would
be
ratified
immediately
and
who
knows
perhaps
even
approved
saint
mary
the
egyptian
gave
her
body
to
boatmen
under
similar
circumstances
she
received
only
glorification
for
it
in
so
doing
she
had
the
certainty
of
attaining
her
goal
which
was
holy
the
end
justified
the
means
but
my
case
is
quite
different
if
i
give
in
to
the
absurd
caprices
of
this
woman
that
will
not
keep
me
from
being
catalogued
down
in
the
red
marble
hall
as
number
or
as
number
if
she
prefers
to
take
you
first
under
those
conditions
under
those
conditions
under
those
conditions
it
would
be
unpardonable
for
me
to
acquiesce
then
what
do
you
intend
to
do
what
do
i
intend
to
do
morhange
leaned
back
in
the
armchair
and
smilingly
launched
a
puff
of
smoke
toward
the
ceiling
nothing
he
said
and
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
man
has
this
superiority
over
woman
he
is
so
constructed
that
he
can
refuse
advances
then
he
added
with
an
ironical
smile
a
man
can
not
be
forced
to
accept
unless
he
wishes
to
i
nodded
i
tried
the
most
subtle
reasoning
on
antinea
he
continued
it
was
breath
wasted
i
said
at
the
end
of
my
arguments
not
le
mesge
she
began
to
laugh
not
the
reverend
spardek
she
replied
mesge
and
spardek
are
savants
whom
i
respect
but
soit
à
jamais
rêveur
inutile
qui
voulut
le
premier
dans
sa
stupidité
problème
insoluble
et
stérile
aux
choses
de
mêler
she
added
with
that
really
very
charming
smile
of
hers
you
have
not
looked
carefully
at
either
of
them
there
followed
several
compliments
on
my
figure
to
which
i
found
nothing
to
reply
so
completely
had
she
disarmed
me
by
those
four
lines
from
baudelaire
she
condescended
to
explain
further
mesge
is
a
learned
gentleman
whom
i
find
useful
he
knows
spanish
and
italian
keeps
my
papers
in
order
and
is
busy
working
out
my
genealogy
the
reverend
spardek
knows
english
and
german
count
bielowsky
is
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
slavic
languages
besides
i
love
him
like
a
father
he
knew
me
as
a
child
when
i
had
not
dreamed
such
stupid
things
as
you
know
of
me
they
are
indispensable
to
me
in
my
relations
with
visitors
of
different
races
although
i
am
beginning
to
get
along
well
enough
in
the
languages
which
i
need
but
i
am
talking
a
great
deal
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
explained
my
conduct
your
friend
is
not
so
curious
with
that
she
dismissed
me
a
strange
woman
indeed
i
think
there
is
a
bit
of
renan
in
her
but
she
is
cleverer
than
that
master
of
sensualism
gentlemen
said
le
mesge
suddenly
entering
the
room
why
are
you
so
late
they
are
waiting
dinner
for
you
the
little
professor
was
in
a
particularly
good
humor
that
evening
he
wore
a
new
violet
rosette
well
he
said
in
a
mocking
tone
you
have
seen
her
neither
morhange
nor
i
replied
the
reverend
spardek
and
the
hetmari
of
jitomir
already
had
begun
eating
when
we
arrived
the
setting
sun
threw
raspberry
lights
on
the
mat
be
seated
gentlemen
said
le
mesge
noisily
lieutenant
de
you
were
not
with
us
last
evening
you
are
about
to
taste
the
cooking
of
koukou
our
bambara
chef
for
the
first
time
you
must
give
me
your
opinion
of
it
a
negro
waiter
set
before
me
a
superb
fish
covered
with
a
pimento
sauce
as
red
as
tomatoes
i
have
explained
that
i
was
ravenously
hungry
the
dish
was
exquisite
the
sauce
immediately
made
me
thirsty
white
ahaggar
the
herman
of
jitomir
breathed
in
my
ear
as
he
filled
my
goblet
with
a
clear
topaz
liquid
i
developed
it
myself
pour
la
tête
tout
pour
les
i
emptied
the
goblet
at
a
gulp
the
company
began
to
seem
charming
well
captain
morhange
le
mesge
called
out
to
my
comrade
who
had
taken
a
mouthful
of
fish
what
do
you
say
to
this
acanthopterygian
it
was
caught
in
the
lake
in
the
oasis
do
you
begin
to
admit
the
hypothesis
of
the
saharan
sea
the
fish
is
an
argument
my
companion
replied
suddenly
he
became
silent
the
door
had
opened
a
white
targa
entered
the
diners
stopped
talking
the
veiled
man
walked
slowly
toward
morhange
and
touched
his
right
arm
very
well
said
morhange
he
got
up
and
followed
the
messenger
the
pitcher
of
ahaggar
stood
between
me
and
count
bielowsky
i
filled
my
goblet
a
goblet
which
held
a
pint
and
gulped
it
down
the
hetman
looked
at
me
sympathetically
ha
ha
laughed
le
mesge
nudging
me
with
his
elbow
antinea
has
respect
for
the
hierarchic
order
the
reverend
spardek
smiled
modestly
ha
ha
laughed
le
mesge
again
my
glass
was
empty
for
a
moment
i
was
tempted
to
hurl
it
at
the
head
of
the
fellow
in
history
but
what
of
it
i
filled
it
and
emptied
it
again
morhange
will
miss
this
delicious
roast
of
mutton
said
the
professor
more
and
more
hilarious
as
he
awarded
himself
a
thick
slice
of
meat
he
wo
regret
it
said
the
hetman
crossly
this
is
not
roast
it
is
ram
horn
really
koukou
is
beginning
to
make
fun
of
us
blame
it
on
the
reverend
the
shrill
voice
of
le
mesge
cut
in
i
have
told
him
often
enough
to
hunt
other
proselytes
and
leave
our
cook
alone
professor
spardek
began
with
dignity
i
maintain
my
contention
cried
le
mesge
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
getting
a
bit
overloaded
i
call
the
gentleman
to
witness
he
went
on
turning
to
me
he
has
just
come
he
is
unbiased
therefore
i
ask
him
has
one
the
right
to
spoil
a
bambara
cook
by
addling
his
head
with
theological
discussions
for
which
he
has
no
predisposition
alas
the
pastor
replied
sadly
you
are
mistaken
he
has
only
too
strong
a
propensity
to
controversy
koukou
is
a
who
uses
colas
cow
as
an
excuse
for
doing
nothing
and
letting
our
scallops
burn
declared
the
hetman
long
live
the
pope
he
cried
filling
the
glasses
all
around
i
assure
you
that
this
bambara
worries
me
spardek
went
on
with
great
dignity
do
you
know
what
he
has
come
to
he
denies
transubstantiation
he
is
within
an
inch
of
the
heresy
of
zwingli
and
oecolampades
koukou
denies
transubstantiation
sir
said
le
mesge
very
much
excited
cooks
should
be
left
in
peace
jesus
whom
i
consider
as
good
a
theologian
as
you
understood
that
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
call
martha
away
from
her
oven
to
talk
nonsense
to
her
exactly
so
said
the
hetman
approvingly
he
was
holding
a
jar
between
his
knees
and
trying
to
draw
its
cork
oh
côtes
rôties
wines
from
the
he
murmured
to
me
as
he
finally
succeeded
touch
glasses
koukou
denies
transubstantiation
the
pastor
continued
sadly
emptying
his
glass
eh
said
the
hetman
of
jitomir
in
my
ear
let
them
talk
on
you
see
that
they
are
quite
drunk
his
own
voice
was
thick
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
the
world
in
filling
my
goblet
to
the
brim
i
wanted
to
push
the
pitcher
away
then
an
idea
came
to
me
at
this
very
moment
morhange
whatever
he
may
say
she
is
so
beautiful
i
reached
out
for
the
glass
and
emptied
it
once
more
le
mesge
and
the
pastor
were
now
engaged
in
the
most
extraordinary
religious
controversy
throwing
at
each
other
heads
the
book
of
common
prayer
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
and
the
unigenitus
little
by
little
the
hetman
began
to
show
that
ascendancy
over
them
which
is
the
characteristic
of
a
man
of
the
world
even
when
he
is
thoroughly
drunk
the
superiority
of
education
over
instruction
count
bielowsky
had
drunk
five
times
as
much
as
the
professor
or
the
pastor
but
he
carried
his
wine
ten
times
better
let
us
leave
these
drunken
fellows
he
said
with
disgust
come
on
old
man
our
partners
are
waiting
in
the
gaming
room
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
hetman
as
we
entered
permit
me
to
present
a
new
player
to
you
my
friend
lieutenant
de
let
it
go
at
that
he
murmured
in
my
ear
they
are
the
servants
but
i
like
to
fool
myself
you
see
i
saw
that
he
was
very
drunk
indeed
the
gaming
room
was
very
long
and
narrow
a
huge
table
almost
level
with
the
floor
and
surrounded
with
cushions
on
which
a
dozen
natives
were
lying
was
the
chief
article
of
furniture
two
engravings
on
the
wall
gave
evidence
of
the
happiest
broadmindedness
in
taste
one
of
da
vinci
john
the
baptist
and
the
des
dernières
of
alphonse
de
neuville
on
the
table
were
earthenware
goblets
a
heavy
jar
held
palm
liqueur
i
recognized
acquaintances
among
those
present
my
masseur
the
manicure
the
barber
and
two
or
three
tuareg
who
had
lowered
their
veils
and
were
gravely
smoking
long
pipes
while
waiting
for
something
better
all
were
plunged
in
the
delights
of
a
card
game
that
looked
like
rams
two
of
antinea
beautiful
ladies
in
waiting
aguida
and
sydya
were
among
the
number
their
smooth
bistre
skins
gleamed
beneath
veils
shot
with
silver
i
was
sorry
not
to
see
the
red
silk
tunic
of
again
i
thought
of
morhange
but
only
for
an
instant
the
chips
koukou
demanded
the
hetman
we
are
not
here
to
amuse
ourselves
the
zwinglian
cook
placed
a
box
of
chips
in
front
of
him
count
bielowsky
set
about
counting
them
and
arranging
them
in
little
piles
with
infinite
care
the
white
are
worth
a
he
explained
to
me
the
red
a
hundred
francs
the
yellow
five
hundred
the
green
a
thousand
oh
it
the
devil
of
a
game
that
we
play
here
you
will
see
i
open
with
ten
thousand
said
the
zwinglian
cook
twelve
thousand
said
the
hetman
thirteen
said
sydya
with
a
slow
smile
as
she
seated
herself
on
the
count
knee
and
began
to
arrange
her
chips
lovingly
in
little
piles
fourteen
i
said
fifteen
said
the
sharp
voice
of
rosita
the
old
manicure
seventeen
proclaimed
the
hetman
twenty
thousand
the
cook
broke
in
he
hammered
on
the
table
and
casting
a
defiant
look
at
us
repeated
i
take
it
at
twenty
thousand
the
hetman
made
an
impatient
gesture
that
devil
koukou
you
ca
do
anything
against
the
beast
you
will
have
to
play
carefully
lieutenant
koukou
had
taken
his
place
at
the
end
of
the
table
he
threw
down
the
cards
with
an
air
which
abashed
me
i
told
you
so
the
way
it
was
at
anna
deslions
the
hetman
murmured
proudly
make
your
bets
gentlemen
yelped
the
negro
make
your
bets
wait
you
beast
called
bielowsky
do
you
see
that
the
glasses
are
empty

cacambo
the
goblets
were
filled
immediately
by
the
jolly
masseur

said
koukou
addressing
sydya
the
beautiful
targa
who
sat
at
his
right
the
girl
cut
like
one
who
knows
superstitions
with
her
left
hand
but
it
must
be
said
that
her
right
was
busy
lifting
a
cup
to
her
lips
i
watched
the
curve
of
her
beautiful
throat
my
deal
said
koukou
we
were
thus
arranged
at
the
left
the
hetman
aguida
whose
waist
he
had
encircled
with
the
most
aristocratic
freedom
cacambo
a
tuareg
woman

two
veiled
negroes
who
were
watching
the
game
intently
at
the
right

and
two
white

grave
and
attentive

added
coldly
i
double
said
the
hetman
cacambo
and
aguida
followed
his
example
on
our
side
we
were
more
careful
the
manicure
especially
would
not
risk
more
than
twenty
francs
at
a
time
i
demand
that
the
cards
be
evened
up
said
koukou
imperturbably
this
fellow
is
unbearable
grumbled
the
count
there
are
you
satisfied
koukou
dealt
and
laid
down
a
nine
my
country
and
my
honor
raged
bielowsky
i
had
an
eight
i
had
two
kings
and
so
showed
no
ill
temper
rosita
took
the
cards
out
of
my
hands
i
watched
sydya
at
my
right
her
heavy
black
hair
covered
her
shoulders
she
was
really
very
beautiful
though
a
bit
tipsy
as
were
all
that
fantastic
company
she
looked
at
me
too
but
with
lowered
eyelids
like
a
timid
little
wild
animal
oh
i
thought
she
may
well
be
afraid
i
am
labelled
trespassing
i
touched
her
foot
she
drew
it
back
in
fright
who
wants
cards
koukou
demanded
not
i
said
the
hetman
served
said
sydya
the
cook
drew
a
four

he
said
that
card
was
meant
for
me
cursed
the
count
and

i
had
a
five
if
only
i
had
never
promised
his
majesty
the
emperor
napoleon
ii
never
to
cut
fives
there
are
times
when
it
is
hard
very
hard
and
look
at
that
beast
of
a
negro
who
plays
charlemagne
it
was
true
koukou
swept
in
of
the
chips
rose
with
dignity
and
bowed
to
the
company
till
gentlemen
get
along
the
whole
pack
of
you
howled
the
hetman
of
jitomir
stay
with
me
lieutenant
de
when
we
were
alone
he
poured
out
another
huge
cupfull
of
liqueur
the
ceiling
of
the
room
was
lost
in
the
gray
smoke
what
time
is
it
i
asked
after
midnight
but
you
are
not
going
to
leave
me
like
this
my
dear
boy
i
am
he
wept
bitterly
the
tail
of
his
coat
spread
out
on
the
divan
behind
him
like
the
wings
of
a
beetle
is
aguida
a
beauty
he
went
on
still
weeping
she
makes
me
think
of
the
countess
de
teruel
though
she
is
a
little
darker
you
know
the
countess
de
teruel
mercedes
who
went
in
bathing
nude
at
biarritz
in
front
of
the
rock
of
the
virgin
one
day
when
prince
bismarck
was
standing
on
the
you
do
not
remember
her
mercedes
de
teruel
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
forget
you
must
have
been
too
young
two
perhaps
three
years
old
a
child
yes
a
child
oh
my
child
to
have
been
of
that
generation
and
to
be
reduced
to
playing
cards
with
savages
i
must
tell
you
i
stood
up
and
pushed
him
off
stay
stay
he
implored
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
how
i
came
here
things
i
have
never
told
anyone
stay
i
must
unbosom
myself
to
a
true
friend
i
will
tell
you
everything
i
repeat
i
trust
you
you
are
a
frenchman
a
gentleman
i
know
that
you
will
repeat
nothing
to
her
that
i
will
repeat
nothing
to
her
to
whom
his
voice
stuck
in
his
throat
i
thought
i
saw
a
shudder
of
fear
pass
over
him
to
her
to
antinea
he
murmured
i
sat
down
again
xiii
the
hetman
of
jitomir
story
count
casimir
had
reached
that
stage
where
drunkenness
takes
on
a
kind
of
gravity
of
regretfulness
he
thought
a
little
then
began
his
story
i
regret
that
i
can
not
reproduce
more
perfectly
its
archaic
flavor
when
the
grapes
begin
to
color
in
antinea
garden
i
shall
be
it
is
very
sad
my
dear
boy
to
have
sowed
all
your
wild
oats
it
is
true
that
life
is
always
beginning
over
again
how
bitter
to
have
known
the
tuileries
in
and
to
have
reached
the
point
where
i
am
now
one
evening
just
before
the
war
i
remember
that
victor
black
was
still
living
some
charming
women
whose
names
i
need
not
disclose
i
read
the
names
of
their
sons
from
time
to
time
in
the
society
news
of
the
expressed
to
me
their
desire
to
rub
elbows
with
some
real
of
the
artist
quarter
i
took
them
to
a
ball
at
the
there
was
a
crowd
of
young
painters
models
students
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
several
couples
danced
the
till
the
chandeliers
shook
with
it
we
noticed
especially
a
little
dark
man
dressed
in
a
miserable
and
checked
trousers
which
assuredly
knew
the
support
of
no
suspenders
he
was
with
a
wretched
beard
and
hair
as
greasy
as
could
be
he
bounded
and
kicked
extravagantly
the
ladies
called
him
léon
gambetta
what
an
annoyance
when
i
realize
that
i
need
only
have
felled
this
wretched
lawyer
with
one
pistol
shot
to
have
guaranteed
perfect
happiness
to
myself
and
to
my
adopted
country
for
my
dear
fellow
i
am
french
at
heart
if
not
by
birth
i
was
born
in
at
warsaw
of
a
polish
father
and
a
russian
mother
it
is
from
her
that
i
hold
my
title
of
hetman
of
jitomir
it
was
restored
to
me
by
czar
alexander
ii
on
a
request
made
to
him
on
his
visit
to
paris
by
my
august
master
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
for
political
reasons
which
i
can
not
describe
without
retelling
the
history
of
unfortunate
poland
my
father
count
bielowsky
left
warsaw
in
and
went
to
live
in
london
after
the
death
of
my
mother
he
began
to
squander
his
immense
fortune
from
sorrow
he
said
when
in
his
time
he
died
at
the
period
of
the
prichard
affair
he
left
me
barely
a
thousand
pounds
sterling
of
income
plus
two
or
three
systems
of
gaming
the
impracticability
of
which
i
learned
later
i
will
never
be
able
to
think
of
my
nineteenth
and
twentieth
years
without
emotion
for
i
then
completely
liquidated
this
small
inheritance
london
was
indeed
an
adorable
spot
in
those
days
i
had
a
jolly
bachelor
apartment
in
piccadilly
shops
palaces
bustle
and
breeze
the
whirling
of
wheels
and
the
murmur
of
trees
fox
hunting
in
a
driving
a
buggy
in
hyde
park
the
rout
not
to
mention
the
delightful
little
parties
with
the
light
venuses
of
drury
lane
this
took
all
my
time
all
i
am
unjust
there
was
also
gaming
and
a
sentiment
of
filial
piety
forced
me
to
verify
the
systems
of
the
late
count
my
father
it
was
gaming
which
was
the
cause
of
the
event
i
must
describe
to
you
by
which
my
life
was
to
be
so
strangely
changed
my
friend
lord
malmesbury
had
said
to
me
a
hundred
times
must
take
you
to
see
an
exquisite
creature
who
lives
in
oxford
street
number
miss
howard
one
evening
i
went
with
him
it
was
the
of
february
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
really
marvelously
beautiful
and
the
guests
were
charming
besides
malmesbury
i
observed
several
acquaintances
lord
clebden
lord
chesterfield
sir
francis
mountjoye
major
in
the
second
life
guards
and
count
they
played
cards
and
then
began
to
talk
politics
events
in
france
played
the
main
part
in
the
conversation
and
they
discussed
endlessly
the
consequences
of
the
revolt
that
had
broken
out
in
paris
that
same
morning
in
consequence
of
the
interdiction
of
the
banquet
in
the
arrondissement
of
which
word
had
just
been
received
by
telegram
up
to
that
time
i
had
never
bothered
myself
with
public
affairs
so
i
do
know
what
moved
me
to
affirm
with
the
impetuosity
of
my
nineteen
years
that
the
news
from
france
meant
the
republic
next
day
and
the
empire
the
day
after
the
company
received
my
sally
with
a
discreet
laugh
and
their
looks
were
centered
on
a
guest
who
made
the
fifth
at
a
table
where
they
had
just
stopped
playing
the
guest
smiled
too
he
rose
and
came
towards
me
i
observed
that
he
was
of
middle
height
perhaps
even
shorter
buttoned
tightly
into
a
blue
frock
coat
and
that
his
eye
had
a
dreamy
look
all
the
players
watched
this
scene
with
delighted
amusement
have
i
the
honor
of
addressing
he
asked
in
a
very
gentle
voice
bielowsky
i
answered
coolly
to
show
him
that
the
difference
in
our
ages
was
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
interrogation
well
my
dear
count
may
your
prediction
indeed
be
realized
and
i
hope
that
you
will
not
neglect
the
tuileries
said
the
guest
in
the
blue
coat
with
a
smile
and
he
added
finally
consenting
to
present
himself
bonaparte
i
played
no
active
rôle
in
the
and
i
do
not
regret
it
it
is
a
principle
with
me
that
a
stranger
should
not
meddle
with
the
internal
affairs
of
a
country
the
prince
understood
this
discretion
and
did
not
forget
the
young
man
who
had
been
of
such
good
omen
to
him
i
was
one
of
the
first
whom
he
called
to
the
elysée
my
fortune
was
definitely
established
by
a
defamatory
note
on
the
little
the
next
year
when
mgr
sibour
was
out
of
the
way
i
was
made
gentleman
of
the
chamber
and
the
emperor
was
even
so
kind
as
to
have
me
marry
the
daughter
of
the
marshal
repeto
duke
of
mondovi
i
have
no
scruple
in
announcing
that
this
union
was
not
what
it
should
have
been
the
countess
who
was
ten
years
older
than
i
was
crabbed
and
not
particularly
pretty
moreover
her
family
had
insisted
resolutely
on
a
marriage
portion
now
i
had
nothing
at
this
time
except
the
thousand
pounds
for
my
appointment
as
gentleman
of
the
chamber
a
sad
lot
for
anyone
on
intimate
terms
with
the
count
and
the
duke
of
without
the
kindness
of
the
emperor
where
would
i
have
been
one
morning
in
the
spring
of
i
was
in
my
study
opening
my
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
his
majesty
calling
me
to
the
tuileries
at
four
a
letter
from
clémentine
informing
me
that
she
expected
me
at
five
at
her
house
clémentine
was
the
beautiful
one
for
whom
just
then
i
was
ready
to
commit
any
folly
i
was
so
proud
of
her
that
one
evening
at
the
i
flaunted
her
before
prince
metternich
who
was
tremendously
taken
with
her
all
the
court
envied
me
that
conquest
and
i
was
morally
obliged
to
continue
to
assume
its
expenses
and
then
clémentine
was
so
pretty
the
emperor
himself
the
other
letters
good
lord
the
other
letters
were
the
bills
of
the
dressmakers
of
that
young
person
who
in
spite
of
my
discreet
remonstrances
insisted
on
having
them
sent
to
my
conjugal
dwelling
there
were
bills
for
something
over
forty
thousand
francs
gowns
and
ball
dresses
from
rue
de
richelieu
hats
and
bonnets
from
madame

from
the

handkerchiefs
from
the

from
this
whitening

particular
overwhelmed
me
with
stupefaction
the
bill
showed
flasks
six
hundred
and
francs
and
fifty
centimes
worth
of
whitening
cream
from
enough
to
soften
the
skin
of
a
squadron
of
a
hundred
guards
ca
keep
on
i
said
putting
the
bills
in
my
pocket
at
ten
minutes
to
four
i
crossed
the
wicket
by
the
carrousel
in
the
salon
of
the
de

happened
on
bacciochi
emperor

the
grippe
he
said

his
room

has
given
orders
to
have
you
admitted
as
soon
as
you
arrive
come
his
majesty
dressed
in
a
braided
vest
and
cossack
trousers
was
meditating
before
a
window
the
pale
green
of
the
tuileries
showed
luminously
under
a
gentle
warm
shower
here
he
is
said
napoleon
have
a
cigarette
it
seems
that
you
had
great
doings
you
and
last
evening
at
the
de
i
smiled
with
satisfaction
your
majesty
knows
already
know
i
know
vaguely
you
know
last
mot
but
you
are
going
to
tell
it
to
me
goes
then
we
were
five
or
six
myself
gramont
persigny
said
the
emperor
has
no
right
to
associate
with
gramont
after
all
that
paris
says
about
his
wife
so
sire
well
persigny
was
excited
no
doubt
about
it
he
began
telling
us
how
troubled
he
was
because
of
the
conduct
fialin
is
over
tactful
muttered
the
emperor
so
sire
then
does
your
majesty
know
what
gramont
hurled
at
him
said
to
him
le
i
forbid
you
to
speak
ill
of
my
mistress
before
me
goes
too
far
said
napoleon
with
a
dreamy
smile
is
what
we
all
thought
including
who
was
nevertheless
delighted
of
this
said
napoleon
after
a
silence
have
forgotten
to
ask
you
for
news
of
the
countess
bielowsky
is
very
well
sire
i
thank
your
majesty
clémentine
still
the
same
dear
child
sire
but
seems
that
baroche
is
madly
in
love
with
her
am
very
much
honored
sire
but
this
honor
becomes
too
burdensome
i
had
drawn
from
my
pocket
that
morning
bills
and
i
spread
them
out
under
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
he
looked
at
them
with
his
distant
smile
come
if
that
is
all
i
can
fix
that
since
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
am
entirely
at
your
majesty
service
he
struck
a
gong
for
m
mocquard
have
the
grippe
he
said
will
explain
the
affair
to
you
the
emperor
private
secretary
entered
is
bielowsky
mocquard
said
napoleon
know
what
i
want
him
to
do
explain
it
to
him
and
he
began
to
tap
on
the
against
which
the
rain
was
beating
furiously
dear
count
said
mocquard
taking
a
chair
is
very
simple
you
have
doubtless
heard
of
a
young
explorer
of
promise
henry
duveyrier
i
shook
my
head
as
a
sign
of
negation
very
much
surprised
at
this
beginning
duveyrier
continued
mocquard
returned
to
paris
after
a
particularly
daring
trip
to
south
africa
and
the
sahara
vivien
de
saint
martin
whom
i
have
seen
recently
has
assured
me
that
the
geographical
society
intends
to
confer
its
great
gold
medal
upon
him
in
recognition
of
these
exploits
in
the
course
of
his
trip
duveyrier
has
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
chief
of
the
people
who
always
have
been
so
rebellious
to
his
majesty
armies
the
tuareg
i
looked
at
the
emperor
my
bewilderment
was
such
that
he
began
to
laugh
he
said
duveyrier
continued
mocquard
able
to
arrange
to
have
a
delegation
of
these
chiefs
come
to
paris
to
present
their
respects
to
his
majesty
very
important
results
may
arise
from
this
visit
and
his
excellency
the
colonial
minister
does
not
despair
of
obtaining
the
signature
of
a
treaty
of
commerce
reserving
special
advantages
to
our
fellow
countrymen
these
chiefs
five
of
them
among
them
sheik
otham
or
sultan
of
the
confederation
of
adzjer
arrive
morning
at
the
de
duveyrier
will
meet
them
but
the
emperor
has
thought
that
besides
thought
said
napoleon
iii
delighted
by
my
bewilderment
thought
that
it
was
correct
to
have
some
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
my
chamber
wait
upon
the
arrival
of
these
mussulman
dignitaries
that
is
why
you
are
here
my
poor
bielowsky
do
be
frightened
he
added
laughing
harder
will
have
duveyrier
with
you
you
are
charged
only
with
the
special
part
of
the
reception
to
accompany
these
princes
to
the
lunch
that
i
am
giving
them
at
the
tuileries
then
in
the
evening
discreetly
on
account
of
their
religious
scruples
to
succeed
in
giving
them
a
very
high
idea
of
parisian
civilization
with
nothing
exaggerated
do
not
forget
that
in
the
sahara
they
are
very
high
religious
dignitaries
in
that
respect
i
have
confidence
in
your
tact
and
give
you
mocquard
will
apportion
on
the
budget
half
to
foreign
affairs
half
to
the
colonies
the
funds
count
bielowsky
will
need
for
the
reception
of
the
tuareg
delegation
it
seems
to
me
that
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
begin
the
count
has
only
to
tell
you
if
he
is
forced
to
exceed
that
figure
clémentine
lived
on
the
rue
boccador
in
a
little
moorish
pavilion
that
i
had
bought
for
her
from
de
lesseps
i
found
her
in
bed
when
she
saw
me
she
burst
into
tears
fools
that
we
are
she
murmured
amidst
her
sobs
have
we
done
tell
me
have
we
done
what
have
we
done
she
repeated
and
i
felt
against
me
her
floods
of
black
hair
her
warm
cheek
which
was
fragrant
with
de
is
it
what
can
it
be
is
and
she
murmured
something
in
my
ear
i
said
stupefied
you
quite
sure
i
quite
sure
i
was
thunderstruck
do
seem
much
pleased
she
said
sharply
did
not
say
that
though
really
i
am
very
much
pleased
i
assure
you
it
to
me
let
us
spend
the
day
together
tomorrow
i
stammered
she
demanded
suspiciously
i
have
to
pilot
the
tuareg
mission
about
paris
the
emperor
orders
bluff
is
this
asked
clémentine
admit
that
nothing
so
much
resembles
a
lie
as
the
truth
i
retold
mocquard
story
to
clémentine
as
well
as
i
could
she
listened
to
me
with
an
expression
that
said
ca
fool
me
that
way
finally
furious
i
burst
out
can
see
for
yourself
i
am
dining
with
them
tomorrow
and
i
invite
you
shall
be
very
pleased
to
come
said
clémentine
with
great
dignity
i
admit
that
i
lacked
at
that
minute
but
think
what
a
day
it
had
been
forty
thousand
francs
of
bills
as
soon
as
i
woke
up
the
ordeal
of
escorting
the
savages
around
paris
all
the
next
day
and
quite
unexpectedly
the
announcement
of
an
approaching
irregular
paternity
all
i
thought
as
i
returned
to
my
house
are
the
emperor
orders
he
has
commanded
me
to
give
the
tuareg
an
idea
of
parisian
civilization
clémentine
comports
herself
very
well
in
society
and
just
now
it
would
not
do
to
aggravate
her
i
will
engage
a
room
for
at
the
de
and
tell
and
to
bring
their
silly
mistresses
it
will
be
very
french
to
enjoy
the
attitude
of
these
children
of
the
desert
in
the
midst
of
this
little
party
the
train
from
marseilles
arrived
at
on
the
platform
i
found
duveyrier
a
young
man
of
with
blue
eyes
and
a
little
blond
beard
the
tuareg
fell
into
his
arms
as
they
descended
from
the
train
he
had
lived
with
them
for
two
years
in
their
tents
the
devil
knows
where
he
presented
me
to
their
chief
sheik
otham
and
to
four
others
splendid
fellows
in
their
blue
cotton
draperies
and
their
amulets
of
red
leather
fortunately
they
all
spoke
a
kind
of
which
helped
things
along
footnote
dialect
spoken
in
algeria
and
the
levant
a
mixture
of
arabian
french
italian
and
spanish
i
only
mention
in
passing
the
lunch
at
the
tuileries
the
visits
in
the
evening
to
the
museum
to
the
de
to
the
imperial
printing
press
each
time
the
tuareg
inscribed
their
names
in
the
registry
of
the
place
they
were
visiting
it
was
interminable
to
give
you
an
idea
here
is
the
complete
name
of
sheik
otham
alone
footnote
i
have
succeeded
in
finding
on
the
registry
of
the
imperial
printing
press
the
names
of
the
tuareg
chiefs
and
those
who
accompanied
them
on
their
visit
henry
duveyrier
and
the
count
bielowsky
note
by
m
leroux
and
there
were
five
of
them
like
that
i
maintained
my
good
humor
however
because
on
the
boulevards
everywhere
our
success
was
colossal
at
the
de
at
it
amounted
to
frenzy
the
delegation
a
little
drunk
embraced
me
napoléon
bono
eugénie
bono
casimir
bono
and
were
already
in
booth
number
eight
with
anna
grimaldi
of
the
and
hortense
schneider
both
beautiful
enough
to
strike
terror
to
the
heart
but
the
palm
was
for
my
dear
clémentine
when
she
entered
i
must
tell
you
how
she
was
dressed
a
gown
of
white
tulle
over
china
blue
tarletan
with
pleatings
and
ruffles
of
tulle
over
the
pleatings
the
tulle
skirt
was
caught
up
on
each
side
by
garlands
of
green
leaves
mingled
with
rose
clusters
thus
it
formed
a
valence
which
allowed
the
tarletan
skirt
to
show
in
front
and
on
the
sides
the
garlands
were
caught
up
to
the
belt
and
in
the
space
between
their
branches
were
knots
of
rose
satin
with
long
ends
the
pointed
bodice
was
draped
with
tulle
the
billowy
bertha
of
tulle
was
edged
with
lace
by
way
of
she
had
placed
upon
her
black
locks
a
diadem
crown
of
the
same
flowers
two
long
leafy
tendrils
were
twined
in
her
hair
and
fell
on
her
neck
as
cloak
she
had
a
kind
of
scarf
of
blue
cashmere
embroidered
in
gold
and
lined
with
blue
satin
so
much
beauty
and
splendor
immediately
moved
the
tuareg
and
especially
clémentine
neighbor
brother
of
sheik
otham
and
sultan
of
ahaggar
by
the
time
the
soup
arrived
a
bouillon
of
wild
game
seasoned
with
tokay
he
was
already
much
smitten
when
they
served
the
compote
of
fruits
martinique
la
liqueur
de
mme
he
showed
every
indication
of
illimitable
passion
the
cyprian
wine
la
made
him
quite
sure
of
his
sentiments
hortense
kicked
my
foot
under
the
table
gramont
intending
to
do
the
same
to
anna
made
a
mistake
and
aroused
the
indignant
protests
of
one
of
the
tuareg
i
can
safely
say
that
when
the
time
came
to
go
to
mabille
we
were
enlightened
as
to
the
manner
in
which
our
visitors
respected
the
prohibition
decreed
by
the
prophet
in
respect
to
wine
at
mabille
while
clémentine
hortense
anna
ludovic
and
the
three
tuareg
gave
themselves
over
to
the
wildest
gallops
sheik
otham
took
me
aside
and
confided
to
me
with
visible
emotion
a
certain
commission
with
which
he
had
just
been
charged
by
his
brother
sheik
ahmed
the
next
day
very
early
i
reached
clémentine
house
dear
i
began
after
having
waked
her
not
without
difficulty
to
me
i
want
to
talk
to
you
seriously
she
rubbed
her
eyes
a
bit
crossly
did
you
like
that
young
arabian
gentleman
who
was
so
taken
with
you
last
night
well
enough
she
said
blushing
you
know
that
in
his
country
he
is
the
sovereign
prince
and
reigns
over
territories
five
or
six
times
greater
than
those
of
our
august
master
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
murmured
something
of
that
kind
to
me
she
said
becoming
interested
would
it
please
you
to
mount
on
a
throne
like
our
august
sovereign
the
empress
eugénie
clémentine
looked
startled
own
brother
sheik
otham
has
charged
me
in
his
name
to
make
this
offer
clémentine
dumb
with
amazement
did
not
reply
empress
she
finally
stammered
decision
rests
with
you
they
must
have
your
answer
before
midday
if
it
is
we
lunch
together
at
voisin
and
the
bargain
is
made
i
saw
that
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
but
she
thought
it
well
to
display
a
little
sentiment
you
you
she
groaned
leave
you
thus
never
foolishness
dear
child
i
said
gently
do
know
perhaps
that
i
am
ruined
yes
completely
i
do
even
know
how
i
am
going
to
pay
for
your
complexion
cream
she
sighed
she
added
however
the
child
child
child
our
child
that
is
so
why
you
will
have
to
put
it
down
to
profit
and
loss
i
am
even
convinced
that
sheik
ahmed
will
find
that
it
resembles
him
can
turn
everything
into
a
joke
she
said
between
laughing
and
crying
the
next
morning
at
the
same
hour
the
marseilles
express
carried
away
the
five
tuareg
and
clémentine
the
young
woman
radiant
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
sheik
ahmed
who
was
beside
himself
with
joy
you
many
shops
in
your
capital
she
asked
him
languidly
and
he
smiling
broadly
under
his
veil
replied
besef
bono
roumis
at
the
last
moment
clémentine
had
a
pang
of
emotion
casimir
you
have
always
been
kind
to
me
i
am
going
to
be
a
queen
if
you
weary
of
it
here
promise
me
swear
to
me
the
sheik
had
understood
he
took
a
ring
from
his
finger
and
slipped
it
onto
mine
casimir
comrade
he
affirmed
come
find
us
take
sidi
ahmed
ring
and
show
it
everybody
at
ahaggar
comrades
ahaggar
when
i
came
out
of
the
de
i
had
the
feeling
of
having
perpetrated
an
excellent
joke
the
hetman
of
jitomir
was
completely
drunk
i
had
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
understanding
the
end
of
his
story
because
he
interjected
every
other
moment
couplets
from
jacques
best

so
kind

am
going
to
be
killed
on
the
barricades
casimir
she
sobbed
falling
into
my
arms
have
misjudged
you
will
you
forgive
me
forgive
you
aurelie
i
said
with
dignified
emotion
have
not
always
been
right
myself
i
tore
myself
away
from
this
mad
scene
it
was
six
on
the
rue
de
bac
i
hailed
a
cab
on
its
mad
career
francs
tip
i
said
to
the
coachman
you
get
to
the
de
in
time
for
the
marseilles
train
six
the
hetman
of
jitomir
could
say
no
more
he
had
rolled
over
on
the
cushions
and
slept
with
clenched
fists
i
walked
unsteadily
to
the
great
window
the
sun
was
rising
pale
yellow
behind
the
sharp
blue
mountains
xiv
hours
of
waiting
it
was
at
night
that
liked
to
tell
me
a
little
of
his
enthralling
history
he
gave
it
to
me
in
short
installments
exact
and
chronological
never
anticipating
the
episodes
of
a
drama
whose
tragic
outcome
i
knew
already
not
that
he
wished
to
obtain
more
effect
that
way
i
felt
that
he
was
far
removed
from
any
calculation
of
that
sort
simply
from
the
extraordinary
nervousness
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
recalling
such
memories
one
evening
the
mail
from
france
had
just
arrived
the
letters
that
chatelain
had
handed
us
lay
upon
the
little
table
not
yet
opened
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
a
pale
halo
in
the
midst
of
the
great
black
desert
we
were
able
to
recognize
the
writing
of
the
addresses
oh
the
victorious
smile
of
when
pushing
aside
all
those
letters
i
said
to
him
in
a
trembling
voice
go
on
he
acquiesced
without
further
words
nothing
can
give
you
any
idea
of
the
fever
i
was
in
from
the
day
when
the
hetman
of
jitomir
told
me
of
his
adventures
to
the
day
when
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
antinea
the
strangest
part
was
that
the
thought
that
i
was
in
a
way
condemned
to
death
did
not
enter
into
this
fever
on
the
contrary
it
was
stimulated
by
my
desire
for
the
event
which
would
be
the
signal
of
my
downfall
the
summons
from
antinea
but
this
summons
was
not
speedy
in
coming
and
from
this
delay
arose
my
unhealthy
exasperation
did
i
have
any
lucid
moments
in
the
course
of
these
hours
i
do
not
think
so
i
do
not
recall
having
even
said
to
myself
you
ashamed
captive
in
an
unheard
of
situation
you
not
only
are
not
trying
to
escape
but
you
even
bless
your
servitude
and
look
forward
to
your
ruin
i
did
not
even
color
my
desire
to
remain
there
to
enjoy
the
next
step
in
the
adventure
by
the
pretext
i
might
have
given
unwillingness
to
escape
without
morhange
if
i
felt
a
vague
uneasiness
at
not
seeing
him
again
it
was
not
because
of
a
desire
to
know
that
he
was
well
and
safe
well
and
safe
i
knew
him
to
be
moreover
the
tuareg
slaves
of
antinea
household
were
certainly
not
very
communicative
the
women
were
hardly
more
loquacious
i
heard
it
is
true
from
sydya
and
aguida
that
my
companion
liked
pomegranates
or
that
he
could
not
endure
of
bananas
but
if
i
asked
for
a
different
kind
of
information
they
fled
in
fright
down
the
long
corridors
with
it
was
different
this
child
seemed
to
have
a
distaste
for
mentioning
before
me
anything
bearing
in
any
way
upon
antinea
nevertheless
i
knew
that
she
was
devoted
to
her
mistress
with
a
doglike
fidelity
but
she
maintained
an
obstinate
silence
if
i
pronounced
her
name
or
persisting
the
name
of
morhange
as
for
the
europeans
i
did
not
care
to
question
these
sinister
puppets
besides
all
three
were
difficult
of
approach
the
hetman
of
jitomir
was
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
alcohol
what
intelligence
remained
to
him
he
seemed
to
have
dissolved
the
evening
when
he
had
invoked
his
youth
for
me
i
met
him
from
time
to
time
in
the
corridors
that
had
become
all
at
once
too
narrow
for
him
humming
in
a
thick
voice
a
couplet
from
the
music
of
reine
ma
fille
isabelle
sois
à
car
elle
est
la
plus
belle
et
toi
le
plus
as
for
pastor
spardek
i
would
cheerfully
have
killed
the
old
skinflint
and
the
hideous
little
man
with
the
decorations
the
placid
printer
of
labels
for
the
red
marble
hall
how
could
i
meet
him
without
wanting
to
cry
out
in
his
face
eh
sir
professor
a
very
curious
case
of
apocope
greek
atlantinea
suppression
of
of
and
of
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
another
case
as
curious
greek
klêmêntinea
clémentine
apocope
of
of
of
and
of
if
morhange
were
with
us
he
would
tell
you
many
charming
erudite
things
about
it
but
alas
morhange
does
not
deign
to
come
among
us
any
more
we
never
see
morhange
my
fever
for
information
found
a
little
more
favorable
reception
from
rosita
the
old
negress
manicure
never
have
i
had
my
nails
polished
so
often
as
during
those
days
of
waiting
now
after
six
years
she
must
be
dead
i
shall
not
wrong
her
memory
by
recording
that
she
was
very
partial
to
the
bottle
the
poor
old
soul
was
defenseless
against
those
that
i
brought
her
and
that
i
emptied
with
her
through
politeness
unlike
the
other
slaves
who
are
brought
from
the
south
toward
turkey
by
the
merchants
of
rhât
she
was
born
in
constantinople
and
had
been
brought
into
africa
by
her
master
when
he
became
of
rhadamès
but
do
let
me
complicate
this
already
wandering
history
by
the
incantations
of
this
manicure
she
said
to
me
the
daughter
of
sultan
of
ahaggar
and
sheik
of
the
great
and
noble
tribe
of
she
was
born
in
the
year
twelve
hundred
and
of
the
hegira
she
has
never
wished
to
marry
any
one
her
wish
has
been
respected
for
the
will
of
women
is
sovereign
in
this
ahaggar
where
she
rules
she
is
a
cousin
of
and
if
she
speaks
the
word
christian
blood
will
flow
from
djerid
to
touat
and
from
tchad
to
senegal
if
she
had
wished
it
she
might
have
lived
beautiful
and
respected
in
the
land
of
the
christians
but
she
prefers
to
have
them
come
to
her
i
said
you
know
him
he
is
entirely
devoted
to
her
here
knows
very
well
because
he
is
continually
traveling
it
is
true
that
he
is
entirely
devoted
to
antinea
is
a
senoussi
and
antinea
is
the
cousin
of
the
chief
of
the
senoussi
besides
he
owes
his
life
to
her
he
is
one
of
the
men
who
assassinated
the
great
kébir
flatters
on
account
of
that
ikenoukhen
of
the
adzjer
tuareg
fearing
french
reprisals
wanted
to
deliver
to
them
when
the
whole
sahara
turned
against
him
he
found
asylum
with
antinea
will
never
forget
it
for
he
is
brave
and
observes
the
law
of
the
prophet
to
thank
her
he
led
to
antinea
who
was
then
twenty
years
old
three
french
officers
of
the
first
troops
of
occupation
in
tunis
they
are
the
ones
who
are
numbered
in
the
red
marble
hall
and
has
always
fulfilled
his
duties
successfully
is
well
trained
and
he
knows
the
vast
sahara
as
i
know
my
little
room
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
at
first
he
made
mistakes
that
is
how
on
his
first
trips
he
brought
back
old
le
mesge
and
marabout
spardek
did
antinea
say
when
she
saw
them
she
laughed
so
hard
that
she
spared
them
was
vexed
to
see
her
laugh
so
since
then
he
has
never
made
a
mistake
has
never
made
a
mistake
i
have
cared
for
the
hands
and
feet
of
all
that
he
has
brought
here
all
were
young
and
handsome
but
i
think
that
your
comrade
whom
they
brought
to
me
the
other
day
after
you
were
here
is
the
handsomest
of
all
i
asked
turning
the
conversation
since
she
spared
them
their
lives
did
she
not
free
the
pastor
and
le
mesge
has
found
them
useful
it
seems
said
the
old
woman
then
whoever
once
enters
here
can
never
leave
otherwise
the
french
would
soon
be
here
and
when
they
saw
the
hall
of
red
marble
they
would
massacre
everybody
besides
of
all
those
whom
has
brought
here
no
one
save
one
has
wished
to
escape
after
seeing
antinea
keeps
them
a
long
time
depends
upon
them
and
the
pleasure
that
she
takes
in
them
two
months
three
months
on
the
average
it
depends
a
big
belgian
officer
formed
like
a
colossus
did
last
a
week
on
the
other
hand
everyone
here
remembers
little
douglas
kaine
an
english
officer
she
kept
him
almost
a
year
then
then
he
died
said
the
old
woman
as
if
astonished
at
my
question
what
did
he
die
she
used
the
same
phrase
as
le
mesge
all
the
others
of
love
love
she
continued
they
all
die
of
love
when
they
see
that
their
time
is
ended
and
that
has
gone
to
find
others
several
have
died
quietly
with
tears
in
their
great
eyes
they
neither
ate
nor
slept
any
more
a
french
naval
officer
went
mad
all
night
he
sang
a
sad
song
of
his
native
country
a
song
which
echoed
through
the
whole
mountain
another
a
spaniard
was
as
if
maddened
he
tried
to
bite
it
was
necessary
to
kill
him
many
have
died
of
a
that
is
more
violent
than
opium
when
they
no
longer
have
antinea
they
smoke
smoke
most
have
died
that
way
the
happiest
little
kaine
died
differently
did
little
kaine
die
a
way
that
pained
us
all
very
much
i
told
you
that
he
stayed
longer
among
us
than
anyone
else
we
had
become
used
to
him
in
antinea
room
on
a
little
kairouan
table
painted
in
blue
and
gold
there
is
a
gong
with
a
long
silver
hammer
with
an
ebony
handle
very
heavy
aguida
told
me
about
it
when
antinea
gave
little
kaine
his
dismissal
smiling
as
she
always
does
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
mute
very
pale
she
struck
the
gong
for
someone
to
take
him
away
a
targa
slave
came
but
little
kaine
had
leapt
for
the
hammer
and
the
targa
lay
on
the
ground
with
his
skull
smashed
antinea
smiled
all
the
time
they
led
little
kaine
to
his
room
the
same
night
eluding
guards
he
jumped
out
of
his
window
at
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
the
workmen
in
the
embalming
room
told
me
that
they
had
the
greatest
difficulty
with
his
body
but
they
succeeded
very
well
you
have
only
to
go
see
for
yourself
he
occupies
niche
number
in
the
red
marble
hall
the
old
woman
drowned
her
emotion
in
her
glass
days
before
she
continued
had
done
his
nails
here
for
this
was
his
room
on
the
wall
near
the
window
he
had
written
something
in
the
stone
with
his
knife
see
it
is
still
here
it
not
fate
that
on
this
july
midnight
at
any
other
moment
that
verse
traced
in
the
stone
of
the
window
through
which
the
english
officer
had
hurled
himself
would
have
killed
me
with
overpowering
emotion
but
just
then
another
thought
was
in
my
heart
me
i
said
controlling
my
voice
as
well
as
i
could
antinea
holds
one
of
us
in
her
power
she
shuts
him
up
near
her
does
she
not
nobody
sees
him
any
more
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
is
not
afraid
that
he
will
escape
the
mountain
is
well
guarded
antinea
has
only
to
strike
her
silver
gong
he
will
be
brought
back
to
her
immediately
my
companion
i
have
not
see
him
since
she
sent
for
him
the
negress
smiled
comprehendingly
you
have
not
seen
him
it
is
because
he
prefers
to
remain
near
her
antinea
does
not
force
him
to
neither
does
she
prevent
him
i
struck
my
fist
violently
upon
the
table
along
with
you
old
fool
and
be
quick
about
it
rosita
fled
frightened
hardly
taking
time
to
collect
her
little
instruments
it
not
fate
that
on
this
july
midnight
i
obeyed
the
negress
suggestion
following
the
corridors
losing
my
way
set
on
the
right
road
again
by
the
reverend
spardek
i
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
red
marble
hall
i
entered
the
freshness
of
the
perfumed
crypt
did
me
good
no
place
can
be
so
sinister
that
it
is
not
as
it
were
purified
by
the
murmur
of
running
water
the
cascade
gurgling
in
the
middle
hall
comforted
me
one
day
before
an
attack
i
was
lying
with
my
section
in
deep
grass
waiting
for
the
moment
the
blast
of
the
bugle
which
would
demand
that
we
leap
forward
into
the
hail
of
bullets
a
stream
was
at
my
feet
i
listened
to
its
fresh
rippling
i
admired
the
play
of
light
and
shade
in
the
transparent
water
the
little
beasts
the
little
black
fish
the
green
grass
the
yellow
wrinkled
sand
the
mystery
of
water
always
has
carried
me
out
of
myself
here
in
this
magic
hall
my
thoughts
were
held
by
the
dark
cascade
it
felt
friendly
it
kept
me
from
faltering
in
the
midst
of
these
rigid
evidences
of
so
many
monstrous
sacrifices
number
it
was
he
all
right
lieutenant
douglas
kaine
born
at
edinburgh
september
died
at
ahaggar
july
he
was
even
his
face
was
thin
under
the
coat
of
orichalch
his
mouth
sad
and
passionate
it
was
certainly
he
poor
edinburgh
i
knew
edinburgh
without
ever
having
been
there
from
the
wall
of
the
castle
you
can
see
the
pentland
hills
look
a
little
lower
down
said
stevenson
sweet
miss
flora
to
anne
of
look
a
little
lower
down
and
you
will
see
in
the
fold
of
the
hill
a
clump
of
trees
and
a
curl
of
smoke
that
rises
from
among
them
that
is
swanston
cottage
where
my
brother
and
i
live
with
my
aunt
if
it
really
pleases
you
to
see
it
i
shall
be
glad
when
he
left
for
darfour
douglas
kaine
must
surely
have
left
in
edinburgh
a
miss
flora
as
blonde
as
flora
but
what
are
these
slips
of
girls
beside
antinea
kaine
however
sensible
a
mortal
however
made
for
this
kind
of
love
had
loved
otherwise
he
was
dead
and
here
was
number
on
account
of
whom
kaine
dashed
himself
on
the
rocks
of
the
sahara
and
who
in
his
turn
is
dead
also
to
die
to
love
how
naturally
the
word
resounded
in
the
red
marble
hall
how
antinea
seemed
to
tower
above
that
circle
of
pale
statues
does
love
then
need
so
much
death
in
order
that
it
may
be
multiplied
other
women
in
other
parts
of
the
world
are
doubtless
as
beautiful
as
antinea
more
beautiful
perhaps
i
hold
you
to
witness
that
i
have
not
said
much
about
her
beauty
why
then
this
obsession
this
fever
this
consumption
of
all
my
being
why
am
i
ready
for
the
sake
of
pressing
this
quivering
form
within
my
arms
for
one
instant
to
face
things
that
i
dare
not
think
of
for
fear
i
should
tremble
before
them
here
is
number
the
last
morhange
will
be
i
shall
be
in
six
months
eight
perhaps
what
difference
anyway
i
shall
be
hoisted
into
this
niche
an
image
without
eyes
a
dead
soul
a
finished
body
i
touched
the
heights
of
bliss
of
exaltation
that
can
be
felt
what
a
child
i
was
just
now
i
lost
my
temper
with
a
negro
manicure
i
was
jealous
of
morhange
on
my
word
why
not
since
i
was
at
it
be
jealous
of
those
here
present
then
of
the
others
the
absent
who
will
come
one
by
one
to
fill
the
black
circle
of
the
still
empty
niches
morhange
i
know
is
at
this
moment
with
antinea
and
it
is
to
me
a
bitter
and
splendid
joy
to
think
of
his
joy
but
some
evening
in
three
months
four
perhaps
the
embalmers
will
come
here
niche
will
receive
its
prey
then
a
targa
slave
will
advance
toward
me
i
shall
shiver
with
superb
ecstasy
he
will
touch
my
arm
and
it
will
be
my
turn
to
penetrate
into
eternity
by
the
bleeding
door
of
love
when
i
emerged
from
my
meditation
i
found
myself
back
in
the
library
where
the
falling
night
obscured
the
shadows
of
the
people
who
were
assembled
there
i
recognized
le
mesge
the
pastor
the
hetman
aguida
two
tuareg
slaves
still
more
all
joining
in
the
most
animated
conference
i
drew
nearer
astonished
even
alarmed
to
see
together
so
many
people
who
ordinarily
felt
no
kind
of
sympathy
for
each
other
an
unheard
of
occurrence
had
thrown
all
the
people
of
the
mountain
into
uproar
two
spanish
explorers
come
from
rio
de
oro
had
been
seen
to
the
west
in
adhar
ahnet
as
soon
as
was
informed
he
had
prepared
to
go
to
meet
them
at
that
instant
he
had
received
the
order
to
do
nothing
henceforth
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
for
the
first
time
antinea
was
in
love
xv
the
lament
of
i
roused
myself
vaguely
from
the
half
sleep
to
which
i
had
finally
succumbed
i
half
opened
my
eyes
immediately
i
flattened
back
two
feet
from
my
face
was
the
muzzle
of
king
hiram
yellow
with
a
tracery
of
black
the
leopard
was
helping
me
to
wake
up
otherwise
he
took
little
interest
for
he
yawned
his
dark
red
jaws
beautiful
gleaming
white
fangs
opened
and
closed
lazily
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
it
was
little
she
was
crouching
on
a
cushion
near
the
divan
where
i
was
stretched
out
curiously
watching
my
close
interview
with
the
leopard
king
hiram
was
bored
she
felt
obliged
to
explain
to
me
i
brought
him
how
nice
i
growled
only
tell
me
could
he
not
have
gone
somewhere
else
to
be
amused
he
is
all
alone
now
said
the
girl
have
sent
him
away
he
made
too
much
noise
when
he
played
these
words
recalled
me
to
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
if
you
like
i
will
make
him
go
away
said
no
let
him
alone
i
looked
at
the
leopard
with
sympathy
our
common
misfortune
brought
us
together
i
even
caressed
his
rounded
forehead
king
hiram
showed
his
contentment
by
stretching
out
at
full
length
and
uncurling
his
great
amber
claws
the
mat
on
the
floor
had
much
to
suffer
galé
is
here
too
said
the
little
girl
galé
who
may
he
be
at
the
same
time
i
saw
on
knees
a
strange
animal
about
the
size
of
a
big
cat
with
flat
ears
and
a
long
muzzle
its
pale
gray
fur
was
rough
it
was
watching
me
with
queer
little
pink
eyes
it
is
my
mongoose
explained
come
now
i
said
sharply
is
that
all
i
must
have
looked
so
crabbed
and
ridiculous
that
began
to
laugh
i
laughed
too
galé
is
my
friend
she
said
when
she
was
serious
again
i
saved
her
life
it
was
when
she
was
quite
little
i
will
tell
you
about
it
some
day
see
how
she
is
so
saying
she
dropped
the
mongoose
on
my
knees
it
is
very
nice
of
you
i
said
to
come
and
pay
me
a
visit
i
passed
my
hand
slowly
over
the
animal
back
what
time
is
it
now
a
little
after
nine
see
the
sun
is
already
high
let
me
draw
the
shade
the
room
was
in
darkness
galé
eyes
grew
redder
king
hiram
became
green
it
is
very
nice
of
you
i
repeated
pursuing
my
idea
i
see
that
you
are
free
you
never
came
so
early
before
a
shade
passed
over
the
girl
forehead
yes
i
am
free
she
said
almost
bitterly
i
looked
at
more
closely
for
the
first
time
i
realized
that
she
was
beautiful
her
hair
which
she
wore
falling
over
her
shoulders
was
not
so
much
curly
as
it
was
gently
waving
her
features
were
of
remarkable
fineness
the
nose
very
straight
a
small
mouth
with
delicate
lips
a
strong
chin
she
was
not
black
but
copper
colored
her
slender
graceful
body
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
disgusting
thick
sausages
which
the
carefully
cared
for
bodies
of
the
blacks
become
a
large
circle
of
copper
made
a
heavy
decoration
around
her
forehead
and
hair
she
had
four
bracelets
still
heavier
on
her
wrists
and
anklets
and
for
clothing
a
green
silk
tunic
slashed
in
points
braided
with
gold
green
bronze
gold
you
are
a
sonrhaï
i
asked
gently
she
replied
with
almost
ferocious
pride
i
am
a
sonrhaï
strange
little
thing
i
thought
evidently
this
was
a
subject
on
which
did
not
intend
the
conversation
to
turn
i
recalled
how
almost
painfully
she
had
pronounced
that
they
when
she
had
told
me
how
they
had
driven
away
king
hiram
i
am
a
sonrhaï
she
repeated
i
was
born
at
gâo
on
the
niger
the
ancient
sonrhaï
capital
my
fathers
reigned
over
the
great
mandingue
empire
you
need
not
scorn
me
because
i
am
here
as
a
slave
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
galé
seated
on
his
little
haunches
washed
his
shining
mustaches
with
his
forepaws
and
king
hiram
stretched
out
on
the
mat
groaned
plaintively
in
his
sleep
he
is
dreaming
said
a
finger
on
her
lips
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
she
said
you
must
be
hungry
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
want
to
eat
with
the
others
i
did
not
answer
you
must
eat
she
continued
if
you
like
i
will
go
get
something
to
eat
for
you
and
me
i
will
bring
king
hiram
and
galé
dinner
here
too
when
you
are
sad
you
should
not
stay
alone
and
the
little
green
and
gold
fairy
vanished
without
waiting
for
my
answer
that
was
how
my
friendship
with
began
each
morning
she
came
to
my
room
with
the
two
beasts
she
rarely
spoke
to
me
of
antinea
and
when
she
did
it
was
always
indirectly
the
question
that
she
saw
ceaselessly
hovering
on
my
lips
seemed
to
be
unbearable
to
her
and
i
felt
her
avoiding
all
the
subjects
towards
which
i
myself
dared
not
direct
the
conversation
to
make
sure
of
avoiding
them
she
prattled
prattled
prattled
like
a
nervous
little
parokeet
i
was
sick
and
this
sister
of
charity
in
green
and
bronze
silk
tended
me
with
such
care
as
never
was
before
the
two
wild
beasts
the
big
and
the
little
were
there
each
side
of
my
couch
and
during
my
delirium
i
saw
their
mysterious
sad
eyes
fixed
on
me
in
her
melodious
voice
told
me
wonderful
stories
and
among
them
the
one
she
thought
most
wonderful
the
story
of
her
life
it
was
not
till
much
later
very
suddenly
that
i
realized
how
far
this
little
barbarian
had
penetrated
into
my
own
life
wherever
thou
art
at
this
hour
dear
little
girl
from
whatever
peaceful
shores
thou
watchest
my
tragedy
cast
a
look
at
thy
friend
pardon
him
for
not
having
accorded
thee
from
the
very
first
the
gratitude
that
thou
deservedest
so
richly
i
remember
from
my
childhood
she
said
the
vision
of
a
yellow
and
sun
rising
through
the
morning
mists
over
the
smooth
waves
of
a
great
river
river
where
there
is
water
the
niger
it
was
but
you
are
not
listening
to
me
i
am
listening
to
you
i
swear
it
little
you
are
sure
i
am
not
wearying
you
you
want
me
to
go
on
go
on
little
go
on
well
with
my
little
companions
of
whom
i
was
very
fond
i
played
at
the
edge
of
the
river
where
there
is
water
under
the
jujube
trees
brothers
of
the
the
spines
of
which
pierced
the
head
of
your
prophet
and
which
we
call
tree
of
paradise
because
our
prophet
told
us
that
under
it
would
live
those
chosen
of
paradise
and
which
is
sometimes
so
big
so
big
that
a
horseman
can
not
traverse
its
shade
in
a
century
footnote
the
koran
chapter
verse
note
by
m
leroux
there
we
wove
beautiful
garlands
with
mimosa
the
pink
flowers
of
the
caper
bush
and
white
cockles
then
we
threw
them
in
the
green
water
to
ward
off
evil
spirits
and
we
laughed
like
mad
things
when
a
great
snorting
hippopotamus
raised
his
swollen
head
and
we
bombarded
him
in
glee
until
he
had
to
plunge
back
again
with
a
tremendous
splash
that
was
in
the
mornings
then
there
fell
on
gâo
the
deathlike
lull
of
the
red
siesta
when
that
was
finished
we
came
back
to
the
edge
of
the
river
to
see
the
enormous
crocodiles
with
bronze
creep
along
little
by
little
among
the
clouds
of
mosquitoes
and
on
the
banks
and
work
their
way
traitorously
into
the
yellow
ooze
of
the
mud
flats
then
we
bombarded
them
as
we
had
done
the
hippopotamus
in
the
morning
and
to
fête
the
sun
setting
behind
the
black
branches
of
the
we
made
a
circle
stamping
our
feet
then
clapping
our
hands
as
we
sang
the
sonrhaï
hymn
such
were
the
ordinary
occupations
of
free
little
girls
but
you
must
not
think
that
we
were
only
frivolous
and
i
will
tell
you
if
you
like
how
i
who
am
talking
to
you
i
saved
a
french
chieftain
who
must
be
vastly
greater
than
yourself
to
judge
by
the
number
of
gold
ribbons
he
had
on
his
white
sleeves
tell
me
little
i
said
my
eyes
elsewhere
you
have
no
right
to
smile
she
said
a
little
aggrieved
and
to
pay
no
attention
to
me
but
never
mind
it
is
for
myself
that
i
tell
these
things
for
the
sake
of
recollection
above
gâo
the
niger
makes
a
bend
there
is
a
little
promontory
in
the
river
thickly
covered
with
large
gum
trees
it
was
an
evening
in
august
and
the
sun
was
sinking
not
a
bird
in
the
forest
but
had
gone
to
rest
motionless
until
the
morning
suddenly
we
heard
an
unfamiliar
noise
in
the
west
growing
louder
and
suddenly
there
was
a
great
flight
of
water
birds
aigrettes
pelicans
wild
ducks
and
teal
which
scattered
over
the
gum
trees
followed
by
a
column
of
black
smoke
which
was
scarcely
flurried
by
the
breeze
that
was
springing
up
it
was
a
gunboat
turning
the
point
sending
out
a
wake
that
shook
the
overhanging
bushes
on
each
side
of
the
river
one
could
see
that
the
red
white
and
blue
flag
on
the
stern
had
drooped
till
it
was
dragging
in
the
water
so
heavy
was
the
evening
she
stopped
at
the
little
point
of
land
a
small
boat
was
let
down
manned
by
two
native
soldiers
who
rowed
and
three
chiefs
who
soon
leapt
ashore
the
oldest
a
french
with
a
great
white
burnous
who
knew
our
language
marvelously
asked
to
speak
to
sheik
when
my
father
advanced
and
told
him
that
it
was
he
the
told
him
that
the
commandant
of
the
club
at
timbuctoo
was
very
angry
that
a
mile
from
there
the
gunboat
had
run
on
an
invisible
pile
of
logs
that
she
had
sprung
a
leak
and
that
she
could
not
so
continue
her
voyage
towards
ansango
my
father
replied
that
the
french
who
protected
the
poor
natives
against
the
tuareg
were
welcome
that
it
was
not
from
evil
design
but
for
fish
that
they
had
built
the
barrage
and
that
he
put
all
the
resources
of
gâo
including
the
forge
at
the
disposition
of
the
french
chief
for
repairing
the
gunboat
while
they
were
talking
the
french
chief
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
him
he
was
already
tall
with
shoulders
a
little
bent
and
blue
eyes
as
clear
as
the
stream
whose
name
i
bear
here
little
one
he
said
in
his
gentle
voice
am
the
daughter
of
sheik
and
i
do
only
what
i
wish
i
replied
vexed
at
his
informality
are
right
he
answered
smiling
you
are
pretty
will
you
give
me
the
flowers
that
you
have
around
your
neck
it
was
a
great
necklace
of
purple
hibiscus
i
held
it
out
to
him
he
kissed
me
the
peace
was
made
meantime
under
the
direction
of
my
father
the
native
soldiers
and
strong
men
of
the
tribe
had
hauled
the
gunboat
into
a
pocket
of
the
river
is
work
there
for
all
day
colonel
said
the
chief
mechanic
after
inspecting
the
leaks
wo
be
able
to
get
away
before
the
day
after
and
if
we
to
do
that
these
lazy
soldiers
must
loaf
on
the
job
an
awful
bore
groaned
my
new
friend
but
his
did
not
last
long
so
ardently
did
my
little
companions
and
i
seek
to
distract
him
he
listened
to
our
most
beautiful
songs
and
to
thank
us
made
us
taste
the
good
things
that
had
been
brought
from
the
boat
for
his
dinner
he
slept
in
our
great
cabin
which
my
father
gave
up
to
him
and
for
a
long
time
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
looked
through
the
cracks
of
the
cabin
where
i
lay
with
my
mother
at
the
lights
of
the
gunboat
trembling
in
red
ripples
on
the
surface
of
the
dark
waves
that
night
i
had
a
frightful
dream
i
saw
my
friend
the
french
officer
sleeping
in
peace
while
a
great
crow
hung
croaking
above
his
head
caw
the
shade
of
the
gum
trees
of
gâo
caw
caw
will
avail
nothing
tomorrow
night
caw
caw
to
the
white
chief
nor
to
his
escort
dawn
had
scarcely
begun
when
i
went
to
find
the
native
soldiers
they
were
stretched
out
on
the
bridge
of
the
gunboat
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
whites
were
still
sleeping
to
do
nothing
i
approached
the
oldest
one
and
spoke
to
him
with
authority
i
saw
the
black
crow
in
a
dream
last
night
he
told
me
that
the
shade
of
the
gum
trees
of
gâo
would
be
fatal
to
your
chief
in
the
coming
night
and
as
they
all
remained
motionless
stretched
out
gazing
at
the
sky
without
even
seeming
to
have
heard
i
added
to
his
escort
it
was
the
hour
when
the
sun
was
highest
and
the
colonel
was
eating
in
the
cabin
with
the
other
frenchmen
when
the
chief
mechanic
entered
do
know
what
has
come
over
the
natives
they
are
working
like
angels
if
they
keep
on
this
way
colonel
we
shall
be
able
to
leave
this
evening
good
said
the
colonel
do
let
them
spoil
the
job
by
too
much
haste
we
do
have
to
be
at
ansango
before
the
end
of
the
week
it
will
be
better
to
start
in
the
morning
i
trembled
suppliantly
i
approached
and
told
him
the
story
of
my
dream
he
listened
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
then
at
the
last
he
said
gravely
is
agreed
little
we
will
leave
this
evening
if
you
wish
it
and
he
kissed
me
the
darkness
had
already
fallen
when
the
gunboat
now
repaired
left
the
harbor
my
friend
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
of
frenchmen
who
waved
their
caps
as
long
as
we
could
see
them
standing
alone
on
the
rickety
jetty
i
waited
watching
the
water
flow
by
until
the
last
sound
of
the
vessel
had
died
away
into
the
night

the

a

only
for

almost
all
lay
with
their
throats
cut
under
the
ruins
of
the
thatch
of
gâo
beside
my
father
brave
once
again
gâo
had
been
razed
by
a
band
of
awellimiden
who
had
come
to
massacre
the
french
on
their
gunboat
the
tuareg
hurried
us
hurried
us
for
they
were
afraid
of
being
pursued
we
traveled
thus
for
ten
days
and
as
the
millet
and
hemp
disappeared
the
march
became
more
frightful
finally
near
isakeryen
in
the
country
of
kidal
the
tuareg
sold
us
to
a
caravan
of
trarzan
moors
who
were
going
from
bamrouk
to
rhât
at
first
because
they
went
more
slowly
it
seemed
good
fortune
but
before
long
the
desert
was
an
expanse
of
rough
pebbles
and
the
women
began
to
fall
as
for
the
men
the
last
of
them
had
died
far
back
under
the
blows
of
the
stick
for
having
refused
to
go
farther
i
still
had
the
strength
to
keep
going
and
even
as
far
in
the
lead
as
possible
so
as
not
to
hear
the
cries
of
my
little
playmates
each
time
one
of
them
fell
by
the
way
unable
to
rise
again
they
saw
one
of
the
drivers
descend
from
his
camel
and
drag
her
into
the
bushes
a
little
way
to
cut
her
throat
but
one
day
i
heard
a
cry
that
made
me
turn
around
it
was
my
mother
she
was
kneeling
holding
out
her
poor
arms
to
me
in
an
instant
i
was
beside
her
but
a
great
moor
dressed
in
white
separated
us
a
red
moroccan
case
hung
around
his
neck
from
a
black
chaplet
he
drew
a
cutlass
from
it
i
can
still
see
the
blue
steel
on
the
brown
skin
another
horrible
cry
an
instant
later
driven
by
a
club
i
was
trotting
ahead
swallowing
my
little
tears
trying
to
regain
my
place
in
the
caravan
near
the
wells
of
asiou
the
moors
were
attacked
by
a
party
of
tuareg
of
serfs
of
the
great
tribe
of
which
rules
over
ahaggar
they
in
their
turn
were
massacred
to
the
last
man
that
is
how
i
was
brought
here
and
offered
as
homage
to
antinea
who
was
pleased
with
me
and
ever
since
has
been
kind
to
me
that
is
why
it
is
no
slave
who
soothes
your
fever
with
stories
that
you
do
not
even
listen
to
but
the
last
descendant
of
the
great
sonrhaï
emperors
of
the
destroyer
of
men
and
of
countries
of
mohammed
azkia
who
made
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
taking
with
him
fifteen
hundred
cavaliers
and
three
hundred
thousand
of
gold
in
the
days
when
our
power
stretched
without
rival
from
chad
to
touat
and
to
the
western
sea
and
when
gâo
raised
her
cupola
sister
of
the
sky
above
the
other
cities
higher
above
her
rival
cupolas
than
is
the
tamarisk
above
the
humble
plants
of
sorghum
xvi
the
silver
hammer
ne
défends
plus
et
je
ne
veux
qu
aller
reconnaître
la
place
où
je
dois
andromaque
it
was
this
sort
of
a
night
when
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
happened
toward
five
the
sky
clouded
over
and
a
sense
of
the
coming
storm
trembled
in
the
stifling
air
i
shall
always
remember
it
it
was
the
fifth
of
january
king
hiram
and
galé
lay
heavily
on
the
matting
of
my
room
leaning
on
my
elbows
beside
in
the
window
i
spied
the
advance
tremors
of
lightning
one
by
one
they
rose
streaking
the
now
total
darkness
with
their
bluish
stripes
but
no
burst
of
thunder
followed
the
storm
did
not
attain
the
peaks
of
ahaggar
it
passed
without
breaking
leaving
us
in
our
gloomy
bath
of
sweat
i
am
going
to
bed
said
i
have
said
that
her
room
was
above
mine
its
bay
window
was
some
thirty
feet
above
that
before
which
i
lay
she
took
galé
in
her
arms
but
king
hiram
would
have
none
of
it
digging
his
four
paws
into
the
matting
he
whined
in
anger
and
uneasiness
leave
him
i
finally
said
to
for
once
he
may
sleep
here
so
it
was
that
this
little
beast
incurred
his
large
share
of
responsibility
in
the
events
which
followed
left
alone
i
became
lost
in
my
reflections
the
night
was
black
the
whole
mountain
was
shrouded
in
silence
it
took
the
louder
and
louder
growls
of
the
leopard
to
rouse
me
from
my
meditation
king
hiram
was
braced
against
the
door
digging
at
it
with
his
drawn
claws
he
who
had
refused
to
follow
a
while
ago
now
wanted
to
go
out
he
was
determined
to
go
out
be
still
i
said
to
him
enough
of
that
lie
down
i
tried
to
pull
him
away
from
the
door
i
succeeded
only
in
getting
a
staggering
blow
from
his
paw
then
i
sat
down
on
the
divan
my
quiet
was
short
be
honest
with
yourself
i
said
since
morhange
abandoned
you
since
the
day
when
you
saw
antinea
you
have
had
only
one
idea
what
good
is
it
to
beguile
yourself
with
the
stories
of
charming
as
they
are
this
leopard
is
a
pretext
perhaps
a
guide
oh
you
know
that
mysterious
things
are
going
to
happen
tonight
how
have
you
been
able
to
keep
from
doing
anything
as
long
as
this
immediately
i
made
a
resolve
if
i
open
the
door
i
thought
king
hiram
will
leap
down
the
corridor
and
i
shall
have
great
difficulty
in
following
him
i
must
find
some
other
way
the
shade
of
the
window
was
worked
by
means
of
a
small
cord
i
pulled
it
down
then
i
tied
it
into
a
firm
leash
which
i
fastened
to
the
metal
collar
of
the
leopard
i
half
opened
the
door
there
now
you
can
go
but
quietly
quietly
i
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
curb
the
ardor
of
king
hiram
who
dragged
me
along
the
shadowy
labyrinth
of
corridors
it
was
shortly
before
nine
and
the
night
lights
were
almost
burned
out
in
the
niches
now
and
then
we
passed
one
which
was
casting
its
last
flickers
what
a
labyrinth
i
realized
that
from
here
on
i
would
not
recognize
the
way
to
her
room
i
could
only
follow
the
leopard
at
first
furious
he
gradually
became
used
to
towing
me
he
strained
ahead
belly
to
the
ground
with
snuffs
of
joy
nothing
is
more
like
one
black
corridor
than
another
black
corridor
doubt
seized
me
suppose
i
should
suddenly
find
myself
in
the
baccarat
room
but
that
was
unjust
to
king
hiram
barred
too
long
from
the
dear
presence
the
good
beast
was
taking
me
exactly
where
i
wanted
him
to
take
me
suddenly
at
a
turn
the
darkness
ahead
lifted
a
rose
window
faintly
glimmering
red
and
green
appeared
before
us
the
leopard
stopped
with
a
low
growl
before
the
door
in
which
the
rose
window
was
cut
i
recognized
it
as
the
door
through
which
the
white
targa
had
led
me
the
day
after
my
arrival
when
i
had
been
set
upon
by
king
hiram
when
i
had
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
antinea
we
are
much
better
friends
i
said
flattering
him
so
that
he
would
not
give
a
dangerously
loud
growl
i
tried
to
open
the
door
the
light
coming
through
the
window
fell
upon
the
floor
green
and
red
a
simple
latch
which
i
turned
i
shortened
the
leash
to
have
better
control
of
king
hiram
who
was
getting
nervous
the
great
room
where
i
had
seen
antinea
for
the
first
time
was
completely
dark
but
the
garden
on
which
it
gave
shone
under
a
clouded
moon
in
a
sky
weighted
down
with
the
storm
which
did
not
break
not
a
breath
of
air
the
lake
gleamed
like
a
sheet
of
pewter
i
seated
myself
on
a
cushion
holding
the
leopard
firmly
between
my
knees
he
was
purring
with
impatience
i
was
thinking
not
about
my
goal
for
a
long
time
that
had
been
fixed
but
about
the
means
then
i
seemed
to
hear
a
distant
murmur
a
faint
sound
of
voices
king
hiram
growled
louder
struggled
i
gave
him
a
little
more
leash
he
began
to
rub
along
the
dark
walls
on
the
sides
whence
the
voices
seemed
to
come
i
followed
him
stumbling
as
quietly
as
i
could
among
the
scattered
cushions
my
eyes
become
accustomed
to
the
darkness
could
see
the
pyramid
of
cushions
on
which
antinea
had
first
appeared
to
me
suddenly
i
stumbled
the
leopard
had
stopped
i
realized
that
i
had
stepped
on
his
tail
brave
beast
he
did
not
make
a
sound
groping
along
the
wall
i
felt
a
second
door
quietly
very
quietly
i
opened
it
as
i
had
opened
the
preceding
one
the
leopard
whimpered
feebly
king
hiram
i
murmured
be
quiet
and
i
put
my
arms
about
his
powerful
neck
i
felt
his
warm
wet
tongue
on
my
hands
his
flanks
quivered
he
shook
with
happiness
in
front
of
us
lighted
in
the
center
another
room
opened
up
in
the
middle
six
men
were
squatting
on
the
matting
playing
dice
and
drinking
coffee
from
tiny
copper
coffee
cups
with
long
stems
they
were
the
white
tuareg
a
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
threw
a
circle
of
light
over
them
everything
outside
that
circle
was
in
deep
shadow
the
black
faces
the
copper
cups
the
white
robes
the
moving
light
and
shadow
made
a
strange
etching
they
played
with
a
reserved
dignity
announcing
the
throws
in
raucous
voices
then
slowly
very
slowly
i
slipped
the
leash
from
the
collar
of
the
impatient
little
beast
go
boy
he
leapt
with
a
sharp
yelp
and
what
i
had
foreseen
happened
the
first
bound
of
king
hiram
carried
him
into
the
midst
of
the
white
tuareg
sowing
confusion
in
the
bodyguard
another
leap
carried
him
into
the
shadow
again
i
made
out
vaguely
the
shaded
opening
of
another
corridor
on
the
side
of
the
room
opposite
where
i
was
standing
there
i
thought
the
confusion
in
the
room
was
indescribable
but
noiseless
one
realized
the
restraint
which
nearness
to
a
great
presence
imposed
upon
the
exasperated
guards
the
stakes
and
the
had
rolled
in
one
direction
the
copper
cups
in
the
other
two
of
the
tuareg
doubled
up
with
pain
were
rubbing
their
ribs
with
low
oaths
i
need
not
say
that
i
profited
by
this
silent
confusion
to
glide
into
the
room
i
was
now
flattened
against
the
wall
of
the
second
corridor
down
which
king
hiram
had
just
disappeared
at
that
moment
a
clear
gong
echoed
in
the
silence
the
trembling
which
seized
the
tuareg
assured
me
that
i
had
chosen
the
right
way
one
of
the
six
men
got
up
he
passed
me
and
i
fell
in
behind
him
i
was
perfectly
calm
my
least
movement
was
perfectly
calculated
all
that
i
risk
here
now
i
said
to
myself
is
being
led
back
politely
to
my
room
the
targa
lifted
a
curtain
i
followed
on
his
heels
into
the
chamber
of
antinea
the
room
was
huge
and
at
once
well
lighted
and
very
dark
while
the
right
half
where
antinea
was
gleamed
under
shaded
lamps
the
left
was
dim
those
who
have
penetrated
into
a
mussulman
home
know
what
a
is
a
kind
of
square
niche
in
the
wall
four
feet
from
the
floor
its
opening
covered
by
a
curtain
one
mounts
to
it
by
wooden
steps
i
noticed
such
a
at
my
left
i
crept
into
it
my
pulses
beat
in
the
shadow
but
i
was
calm
quite
calm
there
i
could
see
and
hear
everything
i
was
in
antinea
chamber
there
was
nothing
singular
about
the
room
except
the
great
luxury
of
the
hangings
the
ceiling
was
in
shadow
but
multicolored
lanterns
cast
a
vague
and
gentle
light
over
gleaming
stuffs
and
furs
antinea
was
stretched
out
on
a
lion
skin
smoking
a
little
silver
tray
and
pitcher
lay
beside
her
king
hiram
was
flattened
out
at
her
feet
licking
them
madly
the
targa
slave
stood
rigid
before
her
one
hand
on
his
heart
the
other
on
his
forehead
saluting
antinea
spoke
in
a
hard
voice
without
looking
at
the
man
why
did
you
let
the
leopard
pass
i
told
you
that
i
wanted
to
be
alone
he
knocked
us
over
mistress
said
the
targa
humbly
the
doors
were
not
closed
then
the
slave
did
not
answer
shall
i
take
him
away
he
asked
and
his
eyes
fastened
upon
king
hiram
who
stared
at
him
maliciously
expressed
well
enough
his
desire
for
a
negative
reply
let
him
stay
since
he
is
here
said
antinea
she
tapped
nervously
on
the
little
silver
tray
what
is
the
captain
doing
she
asked
he
dined
a
while
ago
and
seemed
to
enjoy
his
food
the
targa
answered
has
he
said
nothing
yes
he
asked
to
see
his
companion
the
other
officer
antinea
tapped
the
little
tray
still
more
rapidly
did
he
say
nothing
else
no
mistress
said
the
man
a
pallor
overspread
the
atlantide
little
forehead
go
get
him
she
said
brusquely
bowing
the
targa
left
the
room
i
listened
to
this
dialogue
with
great
anxiety
was
this
morhange
had
he
been
faithful
to
me
after
all
had
i
suspected
him
unjustly
he
had
wanted
to
see
me
and
been
unable
to
my
eyes
never
left
antinea
she
was
no
longer
the
haughty
mocking
princess
of
our
first
interview
she
no
longer
wore
the
golden
circlet
on
her
forehead
not
a
bracelet
not
a
ring
she
was
dressed
only
in
a
full
flowing
tunic
her
black
hair
unbound
lay
in
masses
of
ebony
over
her
slight
shoulders
and
her
bare
arms
her
beautiful
eyes
were
deep
circled
her
divine
mouth
drooped
i
did
not
know
whether
i
was
glad
or
sorry
to
see
this
new
quivering
cleopatra
flattened
at
her
feet
king
hiram
gazed
submissively
at
her
an
immense
orichalch
mirror
with
golden
reflections
was
set
into
the
wall
at
the
right
suddenly
she
raised
herself
erect
before
it
i
saw
her
nude
a
splendid
and
bitter
sight
a
woman
who
thinks
herself
alone
standing
before
her
mirror
in
expectation
of
the
man
she
wishes
to
subdue
the
six
scattered
about
the
room
sent
up
invisible
columns
of
perfume
the
balsam
spices
of
arabia
wore
floating
webs
in
which
my
shameless
senses
were
entangled
and
back
toward
me
standing
straight
as
a
lily
antinea
smiled
into
her
mirror
low
steps
sounded
in
the
corridor
antinea
immediately
fell
back
into
the
nonchalant
pose
in
which
i
had
first
seen
her
one
had
to
see
such
a
transformation
to
believe
it
possible
morhange
entered
the
room
preceded
by
a
white
targa
he
too
seemed
rather
pale
but
i
was
most
struck
by
the
expression
of
serene
peace
on
that
face
which
i
thought
i
knew
so
well
i
felt
that
i
never
had
understood
what
manner
of
man
morhange
was
never
he
stood
erect
before
antinea
without
seeming
to
notice
her
gesture
inviting
him
to
be
seated
she
smiled
at
him
you
are
surprised
perhaps
she
said
finally
that
i
should
send
for
you
at
so
late
an
hour
morhange
did
not
move
an
eyelash
have
you
considered
it
well
she
demanded
morhange
smiled
gravely
but
did
not
reply
i
could
read
in
antinea
face
the
effort
it
cost
her
to
continue
smiling
i
admired
the
of
these
two
beings
i
sent
for
you
she
continued
you
do
not
guess
why
well
it
is
to
tell
you
something
that
you
do
not
expect
it
will
be
no
surprise
to
you
if
i
say
that
i
never
met
a
man
like
you
during
your
captivity
you
have
expressed
only
one
wish
do
you
recall
it
i
asked
your
permission
to
see
my
friend
before
i
died
said
morhange
simply
i
do
not
know
what
stirred
me
more
on
hearing
these
words
delight
at
morhange
formal
tone
in
speaking
to
antinea
or
emotion
at
hearing
the
one
wish
he
had
expressed
but
antinea
continued
calmly
that
is
why
i
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
that
you
are
going
to
see
him
again
and
i
am
going
to
do
something
else
you
will
perhaps
scorn
me
even
more
when
you
realize
that
you
had
only
to
oppose
me
to
bend
me
to
your
will
i
who
have
bent
all
other
wills
to
mine
but
however
that
may
be
it
is
decided
i
give
you
both
your
liberty
tomorrow
will
lead
you
past
the
fifth
enclosure
are
you
satisfied
i
am
said
morhange
with
a
mocking
smile
that
will
give
me
a
chance
he
continued
to
make
better
plans
for
the
next
trip
i
intend
to
make
this
way
for
you
need
not
doubt
that
i
shall
feel
bound
to
return
to
express
my
gratitude
only
next
time
to
render
so
great
a
queen
the
honors
due
her
i
shall
ask
my
government
to
furnish
me
with
two
or
three
hundred
european
soldiers
and
several
cannon
antinea
was
standing
up
very
pale
what
are
you
saying
i
am
saying
said
morhange
coldly
that
i
foresaw
this
first
threats
then
promises
antinea
stepped
toward
him
he
had
folded
his
arms
he
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
grave
pity
i
will
make
you
die
in
the
most
atrocious
agonies
she
said
finally
i
am
your
prisoner
morhange
replied
you
shall
suffer
things
that
you
can
not
even
imagine
i
am
your
prisoner
repeated
morhange
in
the
same
sad
calm
antinea
paced
the
room
like
a
beast
in
a
cage
she
advanced
toward
my
companion
and
no
longer
mistress
of
herself
struck
him
in
the
face
he
smiled
and
caught
hold
of
her
drawing
her
little
wrists
together
with
a
strange
mixture
of
force
and
gentleness
king
hiram
growled
i
thought
he
was
about
to
leap
but
the
cold
eyes
of
morhange
held
him
fascinated
i
will
have
your
comrade
killed
before
your
eyes
gasped
antinea
it
seemed
to
me
that
morhange
paled
but
only
for
a
second
i
was
overcome
by
the
nobility
and
insight
of
his
reply
my
companion
is
brave
he
does
not
fear
death
and
in
any
case
he
would
prefer
death
to
life
purchased
at
the
price
you
name
so
saying
he
let
go
antinea
wrists
her
pallor
was
terrible
from
the
expression
of
her
mouth
i
felt
that
this
would
be
her
last
word
to
him
listen
she
said
how
beautiful
she
was
in
her
scorned
majesty
her
beauty
powerless
for
the
first
time
listen
she
continued
listen
for
the
last
time
remember
that
i
hold
the
gates
of
this
palace
that
i
have
supreme
power
over
your
life
remember
that
you
breathe
only
at
my
pleasure
remember
i
have
remembered
all
that
said
morhange
a
last
time
she
repeated
the
serenity
of
morhange
face
was
so
powerful
that
i
scarcely
noticed
his
opponent
in
that
transfigured
countenance
no
trace
of
worldliness
remained
a
last
time
came
antinea
voice
almost
breaking
morhange
was
not
even
looking
at
her
as
you
will
she
said
her
gong
resounded
she
had
struck
the
silver
disc
the
white
targa
appeared
leave
the
room
morhange
his
head
held
high
went
out
now
antinea
is
in
my
arms
this
is
no
haughty
voluptuous
woman
whom
i
am
pressing
to
my
heart
it
is
only
an
unhappy
scorned
little
girl
so
great
was
her
trouble
that
she
showed
no
surprise
when
i
stepped
out
beside
her
her
head
is
on
my
shoulder
like
the
crescent
moon
in
the
black
clouds
i
see
her
clear
little
profile
amid
her
mass
of
hair
her
warm
arms
hold
me
convulsively
tremblant
coeur
who
could
resist
such
an
embrace
amid
the
soft
perfumes
in
the
langorous
night
i
feel
myself
a
being
without
will
is
this
my
voice
the
voice
which
is
murmuring
ask
me
what
you
will
and
i
will
do
it
i
will
do
it
my
senses
are
sharpened
tenfold
keen
my
head
rests
against
a
soft
nervous
little
knee
clouds
of
odors
whirl
about
me
suddenly
it
seems
as
if
the
golden
lanterns
are
waving
from
the
ceiling
like
giant
censers
is
this
my
voice
the
voice
repeating
in
a
dream
ask
me
what
you
will
and
i
will
do
it
i
will
do
it
antinea
face
is
almost
touching
mine
a
strange
light
flickers
in
her
great
eyes
beyond
i
see
the
gleaming
eyes
of
king
hiram
beside
him
there
is
a
little
table
of
kairouan
blue
and
gold
on
that
table
i
see
the
gong
with
which
antinea
summons
the
slaves
i
see
the
hammer
with
which
she
struck
it
just
now
a
hammer
with
a
long
ebony
handle
a
heavy
silver
head
the
hammer
with
which
little
lieutenant
kaine
dealt
death
i
see
nothing
more
xvii
the
maidens
of
the
rocks
i
awakened
in
my
room
the
sun
already
at
its
zenith
filled
the
place
with
unbearable
light
and
heat
the
first
thing
i
saw
on
opening
my
eyes
was
the
shade
ripped
down
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
then
confusedly
the
night
events
began
to
come
back
to
me
my
head
felt
stupid
and
heavy
my
mind
wandered
my
memory
seemed
blocked
i
went
out
with
the
leopard
that
is
certain
that
red
mark
on
my
forefinger
shows
how
he
strained
at
the
leash
my
knees
are
still
dusty
i
remember
creeping
along
the
wall
in
the
room
where
the
white
tuareg
were
playing
at
dice
that
was
the
minute
after
king
hiram
had
leapt
past
them
after
that
oh
morhange
and
antinea
and
then
i
recalled
nothing
more
i
recalled
nothing
more
but
something
must
have
happened
something
which
i
could
not
remember
i
was
uneasy
i
wanted
to
go
back
yet
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
afraid
to
go
i
have
never
felt
anything
more
painful
than
those
conflicting
emotions
it
is
a
long
way
from
here
to
antinea
apartments
i
must
have
been
very
sound
asleep
not
to
have
noticed
when
they
brought
me
back
for
they
have
brought
me
back
i
stopped
trying
to
think
it
out
my
head
ached
too
much
i
must
have
air
i
murmured
i
am
roasting
here
it
will
drive
me
mad
i
had
to
see
someone
no
matter
whom
mechanically
i
walked
toward
the
library
i
found
le
mesge
in
a
transport
of
delirious
joy
the
professor
was
engaged
in
opening
an
enormous
bale
carefully
sewed
in
a
brown
blanket
you
come
at
a
good
time
sir
he
cried
on
seeing
me
enter
the
magazines
have
just
arrived
he
dashed
about
in
feverish
haste
presently
a
stream
of
pamphlets
and
magazines
blue
green
yellow
and
salmon
was
bursting
from
an
opening
in
the
bale
splendid
splendid
he
cried
dancing
with
joy
not
too
late
either
here
are
the
numbers
for
october
fifteenth
we
must
give
a
vote
of
thanks
to
good
ameur
his
good
spirits
were
contagious
there
is
a
good
turkish
merchant
who
subscribes
to
all
the
interesting
magazines
of
the
two
continents
he
sends
them
on
by
rhadamès
to
a
destination
which
he
little
suspects
ah
here
are
the
french

le
mesge
ran
feverishly
over
the
tables
of

politics

and
le
mesge
was
really
delirious
with
it
a
puff
of
breeze
came
from
the
window
i
went
to
the
balustrade
and
resting
my
elbows
on
it
began
to
run
through
a
number
of
the
des
deux
i
did
not
read
but
flipped
over
the
pages
my
eyes
now
on
the
lines
of
swarming
little
black
characters
now
on
the
rocky
basin
which
lay
shivering
pale
pink
under
the
declining
sun
suddenly
my
attention
became
fixed
there
was
a
strange
coincidence
between
the
text
and
the
landscape
in
the
sky
overhead
were
only
light
shreds
of
cloud
like
bits
of
white
ash
floating
up
from
logs
the
sun
fell
over
a
circle
of
rocky
peaks
silhouetting
their
severe
lines
against
the
azure
sky
from
on
high
a
great
sadness
and
gentleness
poured
down
into
the
lonely
enclosure
like
a
magic
drink
into
a
deep
cup

page
i
turned
the
pages
feverishly
my
mind
seemed
to
be
clearing
behind
me
le
mesge
deep
in
an
article
voiced
his
opinions
in
indignant
growls
i
continued
reading
on
all
sides
a
magnificent
view
spread
out
before
us
in
the
raw
light
the
chain
of
rocks
clearly
visible
in
their
barren
desolation
which
stretched
to
the
very
summit
lay
stretched
out
like
some
great
heap
of
gigantic
unformed
things
left
by
some
primordial
race
of
titans
to
stupefy
human
beings
overturned
towers
it
is
shameful
downright
shameful
the
professor
was
repeating
overturned
towers
crumbling
citadels
cupolas
fallen
in
broken
pillars
mutilated
colossi
prows
of
vessels
thighs
of
monsters
bones
of
titans
this
mass
impassable
with
its
ridges
and
gullies
seemed
the
embodiment
of
everything
huge
and
tragic
so
clear
were
the
distances
downright
shameful
le
mesge
kept
on
saying
in
exasperation
thumping
his
fist
on
the
table
so
clear
were
the
distances
that
i
could
see
as
if
i
had
it
under
my
eyes
infinitely
enlarged
every
contour
of
the
rock
which
violante
had
shown
me
through
the
window
with
the
gesture
of
a
creator
trembling
i
closed
the
magazine
at
my
feet
now
red
i
saw
the
rock
which
antinea
had
pointed
out
to
me
the
day
of
our
first
interview
huge
steep
overhanging
the
reddish
brown
garden
that
is
my
horizon
she
had
said
le
mesge
excitement
had
passed
all
bounds
it
is
worse
than
shameful
it
is
infamous
i
almost
wanted
to
strangle
him
into
silence
he
seized
my
arm
read
that
sir
and
although
you
do
know
a
great
deal
about
the
subject
you
will
see
that
this
article
on
roman
africa
is
a
miracle
of
misinformation
a
monument
of
ignorance
and
it
is
signed
do
you
know
by
whom
it
is
signed
leave
me
alone
i
said
brutally
well
it
is
signed
gaston
boissier
yes
sir
gaston
boissier
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
lecturer
at
the
normale
permanent
secretary
of
the
french
academy
member
of
the
academy
of
inscriptions
and
literature
one
of
those
who
once
ruled
out
the
subject
of
my
thesis
one
of
those
ah
poor
university
ah
poor
france
i
was
no
longer
listening
i
had
begun
to
read
again
my
forehead
was
covered
with
sweat
but
it
seemed
as
if
my
head
had
been
cleared
like
a
room
when
a
window
is
opened
memories
were
beginning
to
come
back
like
doves
winging
their
way
home
to
the
dovecote
at
that
moment
an
irrepressible
tremor
shook
her
whole
body
her
eyes
dilated
as
if
some
terrible
sight
had
filled
them
with
horror
she
murmured
and
for
seconds
she
was
unable
to
say
another
word
i
looked
at
her
in
mute
anguish
and
the
suffering
which
drew
her
dear
lips
together
seemed
also
to
clutch
at
my
heart
the
vision
which
was
in
her
eyes
passed
into
mine
and
i
saw
again
the
thin
white
face
of
antonello
and
the
quick
quivering
of
his
eyelids
the
waves
of
agony
which
seized
his
long
worn
body
and
shook
it
like
a
reed
i
threw
the
magazine
upon
the
table
that
is
it
i
said
to
cut
the
pages
i
had
used
the
knife
with
which
le
mesge
had
cut
the
cords
of
the
bale
a
short
dagger
one
of
those
daggers
that
the
tuareg
wear
in
a
bracelet
sheath
against
the
upper
left
arm
i
slipped
it
into
the
big
pocket
of
my
flannel
dolman
and
walked
toward
the
door
i
was
about
to
cross
the
threshold
when
i
heard
le
mesge
call
me
monsieur
de
saint
avit
monsieur
de
saint
avit
i
want
to
ask
you
something
please
what
is
it
nothing
important
you
know
that
i
have
to
mark
the
labels
for
the
red
marble
hall
i
walked
toward
the
table
well
i
forgot
to
ask
morhange
at
the
beginning
the
date
and
place
of
his
birth
after
that
i
had
no
chance
i
did
not
see
him
again
so
i
am
forced
to
turn
to
you
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
i
can
i
said
very
calmly
he
took
a
large
white
card
from
a
box
which
contained
several
and
dipped
his
pen
number
captain
captain
morhange
while
i
dictated
one
hand
resting
on
the
table
i
noticed
on
my
cuff
a
stain
a
little
stain
reddish
brown
morhange
repeated
le
mesge
finishing
the
lettering
of
my
friend
name
born
at
villefranche
villefranche
rhône
what
date
the
fourteenth
of
october
the
fourteenth
of
october
good
died
at
ahaggar
the
fifth
of
january
there
that
is
done
a
thousand
thanks
sir
for
your
kindness
you
are
welcome
i
left
le
mesge
my
mind
thenceforth
was
well
made
up
and
as
i
said
i
was
perfectly
calm
nevertheless
when
i
had
taken
leave
of
le
mesge
i
felt
the
need
of
waiting
a
few
minutes
before
executing
my
decision
first
i
wandered
through
the
corridors
then
finding
myself
near
my
room
i
went
to
it
it
was
still
intolerably
hot
i
sat
down
on
my
divan
and
began
to
think
the
dagger
in
my
pocket
bothered
me
i
took
it
out
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
it
was
a
good
dagger
with
a
blade
and
with
a
collar
of
orange
leather
between
the
blade
and
the
handle
the
sight
of
it
recalled
the
silver
hammer
i
remembered
how
easily
it
fitted
into
my
hand
when
i
struck
every
detail
of
the
scene
came
back
to
me
with
incomparable
vividness
but
i
did
not
even
shiver
it
seemed
as
if
my
determination
to
kill
the
instigator
of
the
murder
permitted
me
peacefully
to
evoke
its
brutal
details
if
i
reflected
over
my
deed
it
was
to
be
surprised
at
it
not
to
condemn
myself
well
i
said
to
myself
i
have
killed
this
morhange
who
was
once
a
baby
who
like
all
the
others
cost
his
mother
so
much
trouble
with
his
baby
sicknesses
i
have
put
an
end
to
his
life
i
have
reduced
to
nothingness
the
monument
of
love
of
tears
of
trials
overcome
and
pitfalls
escaped
which
constitutes
a
human
existence
what
an
extraordinary
adventure
that
was
all
no
fear
no
remorse
none
of
that
shakespearean
horror
after
the
murder
which
today
sceptic
though
i
am
and
blasé
and
utterly
utterly
disillusioned
sets
me
shuddering
whenever
i
am
alone
in
a
dark
room
come
i
thought
it
time
time
to
finish
it
up
i
picked
up
the
dagger
before
putting
it
in
my
pocket
i
went
through
the
motion
of
striking
all
was
well
the
dagger
fitted
into
my
hand
i
had
been
through
antinea
apartment
only
when
guided
the
first
time
by
the
white
targa
the
second
time
by
the
leopard
yet
i
found
the
way
again
without
trouble
just
before
coming
to
the
door
with
the
rose
window
i
met
a
targa
let
me
pass
i
ordered
your
mistress
has
sent
for
me
the
man
obeyed
stepping
back
soon
a
dim
melody
came
to
my
ears
i
recognized
the
sound
of
a
the
violin
with
a
single
string
played
by
the
tuareg
women
it
was
aguida
playing
squatting
as
usual
at
the
feet
of
her
mistress
the
three
other
women
were
also
squatted
about
her
was
not
there
oh
since
that
was
the
last
time
i
saw
her
let
oh
let
me
tell
you
of
antinea
how
she
looked
in
that
supreme
moment
did
she
feel
the
danger
hovering
over
her
and
did
she
wish
to
brave
it
by
her
surest
artifices
i
had
in
mind
the
slender
unadorned
body
without
rings
without
jewels
which
i
had
pressed
to
my
heart
the
night
before
and
now
i
started
in
surprise
at
seeing
before
me
adorned
like
an
idol
not
a
woman
but
a
queen
the
heavy
splendor
of
the
pharaohs
weighted
down
her
slender
body
on
her
head
was
the
great
gold
of
egyptian
gods
and
kings
emeralds
the
national
stone
of
the
tuareg
were
set
in
it
tracing
and
retracing
her
name
in
tifinar
characters
a
red
satin
embroidered
in
golden
lotus
enveloped
her
like
the
casket
of
a
jewel
at
her
feet
lay
an
ebony
scepter
headed
with
a
trident
her
bare
arms
were
encircled
by
two
serpents
whose
fangs
touched
her
armpits
as
if
to
bury
themselves
there
from
the
ear
pieces
of
the
streamed
a
necklace
of
emeralds
its
first
strand
passed
under
her
determined
chin
the
others
lay
in
circles
against
her
bare
throat
she
smiled
as
i
entered
i
was
expecting
you
she
said
simply
i
advanced
till
i
was
four
steps
from
the
throne
then
stopped
before
her
she
looked
at
me
ironically
what
is
that
she
asked
with
perfect
calm
i
followed
her
gesture
the
handle
of
the
dagger
protruded
from
my
pocket
i
drew
it
out
and
held
it
firmly
in
my
hand
ready
to
strike
the
first
of
you
who
moves
will
be
sent
naked
six
leagues
into
the
red
desert
and
left
there
to
die
said
antinea
coldly
to
her
women
whom
my
gesture
had
thrown
into
a
frightened
murmuring
she
turned
to
me
that
dagger
is
very
ugly
and
you
hold
it
badly
shall
i
send
sydya
to
my
room
to
get
the
silver
hammer
you
are
more
adroit
with
it
than
with
the
dagger
antinea
i
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
going
to
kill
you
do
not
speak
so
formally
you
were
more
affectionate
last
night
are
you
embarrassed
by
them
she
said
pointing
to
the
women
whose
eyes
were
wide
with
terror
kill
me
she
went
on
you
are
hardly
reasonable
kill
me
at
the
moment
when
you
can
reap
the
fruits
of
the
murder
of
did
did
he
suffer
i
asked
suddenly
trembling
very
little
i
told
you
that
you
used
the
hammer
as
if
you
had
done
nothing
else
all
your
life
like
little
kaine
i
murmured
she
smiled
in
surprise
oh
you
know
that
story
yes
like
little
kaine
but
at
least
kaine
was
sensible
you
i
do
not
understand
i
do
not
understand
myself
very
well
she
looked
at
me
with
amused
curiosity
antinea
i
said
what
is
it
i
did
what
you
told
me
to
may
i
in
turn
ask
one
favor
ask
you
one
question
what
is
it
it
was
dark
was
it
not
in
the
room
where
was
very
dark
i
had
to
lead
you
to
the
bed
where
he
lay
asleep
he
asleep
you
are
sure
i
said
so
he
did
not
die
instantly
did
he
no
i
know
exactly
when
he
died
two
minutes
after
you
struck
him
and
fled
with
a
shriek
then
surely
could
not
have
known
known
what
that
it
was
i
who
who
held
the
hammer
he
might
not
have
known
it
indeed
antinea
said
but
he
did
know
how
he
did
know
because
i
told
him
she
said
staring
at
me
with
magnificent
audacity
and
i
murmured
he
he
believed
it
with
the
help
of
my
explanation
he
recognized
your
shriek
if
he
had
not
realized
that
you
were
his
murderer
the
affair
would
not
have
interested
me
she
finished
with
a
scornful
little
smile
four
steps
i
said
separated
me
from
antinea
i
sprang
forward
but
before
i
reached
her
i
was
struck
to
the
floor
king
hiram
had
leapt
at
my
throat
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
the
calm
haughty
voice
of
antinea
call
the
men
she
commanded
a
second
later
i
was
released
from
the
leopard
clutch
the
six
white
tuareg
had
surrounded
me
and
were
trying
to
bind
me
i
am
fairly
strong
and
quick
i
was
on
my
feet
in
a
second
one
of
my
enemies
lay
on
the
floor
ten
feet
away
felled
by
a
blow
on
the
jaw
another
was
gasping
under
my
knee
that
was
the
last
time
i
saw
antinea
she
stood
erect
both
hands
resting
on
her
ebony
scepter
watching
the
struggle
with
a
smile
of
contemptuous
interest
suddenly
i
gave
a
loud
cry
and
loosed
the
hold
i
had
on
my
victim
a
cracking
in
my
left
arm
one
of
the
tuareg
had
seized
it
and
twisted
until
my
shoulder
was
dislocated
when
i
completely
lost
consciousness
i
was
being
carried
down
the
corridor
by
two
white
phantoms
so
bound
that
i
could
not
move
a
muscle
xviii
the
through
the
great
open
window
waves
of
pale
moonlight
surged
into
my
room
a
slender
white
figure
was
standing
beside
the
bed
where
i
lay
you
i
murmured
she
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
sh
yes
it
is
i
i
tried
to
raise
myself
up
on
the
bed
a
terrible
pain
seized
my
shoulder
the
events
of
the
afternoon
came
back
to
my
poor
harassed
mind
oh
little
one
if
you
knew
i
know
she
said
i
was
weaker
than
a
baby
after
the
overstrain
of
the
day
had
come
a
fit
of
utter
nervous
depression
a
lump
rose
in
my
throat
choking
me
if
you
knew
if
you
only
knew
take
me
away
little
one
get
me
away
from
here
not
so
loud
she
whispered
there
is
a
white
targa
on
guard
at
the
door
take
me
away
save
me
i
repeated
that
is
what
i
came
for
she
said
simply
i
looked
at
her
she
no
longer
was
wearing
her
beautiful
red
silk
tunic
a
plain
white
was
wrapped
about
her
and
she
had
drawn
one
corner
of
it
over
her
head
i
want
to
go
away
too
she
said
in
a
smothered
voice
for
a
long
time
i
have
wanted
to
go
away
i
want
to
see
gâo
the
village
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
the
blue
gum
trees
and
the
green
water
ever
since
i
came
here
i
have
wanted
to
get
away
she
repeated
but
i
am
too
little
to
go
alone
into
the
great
sahara
i
never
dared
speak
to
the
others
who
came
here
before
you
they
all
thought
only
of
but
you
you
wanted
to
kill
her
i
gave
a
low
moan
you
are
suffering
she
said
they
broke
your
arm
dislocated
it
anyhow
let
me
see
with
infinite
gentleness
she
passed
her
smooth
little
hands
over
my
shoulder
you
tell
me
that
there
is
a
white
targa
on
guard
before
my
door
i
said
then
how
did
you
get
in
that
way
she
said
pointing
to
the
window
a
dark
perpendicular
line
halved
its
blue
opening
went
to
the
window
i
saw
her
standing
erect
on
the
sill
a
knife
shone
in
her
hands
she
cut
the
rope
at
the
top
of
the
opening
it
slipped
down
to
the
stone
with
a
dry
sound
she
came
back
to
me
how
can
we
escape
i
asked
that
way
she
repeated
and
she
pointed
again
at
the
window
i
leaned
out
my
feverish
gaze
fell
upon
the
shadowy
depths
searching
for
those
invisible
rocks
the
rocks
upon
which
little
kaine
had
dashed
himself
that
way
i
exclaimed
shuddering
why
it
is
two
hundred
feet
from
here
to
the
ground
the
rope
is
two
hundred
and
fifty
she
replied
it
is
a
good
strong
rope
which
i
stole
in
the
oasis
they
used
it
in
felling
trees
it
is
quite
new
climb
down
that
way
with
my
shoulder
i
will
let
you
down
she
said
firmly
feel
how
strong
my
arms
are
not
that
i
shall
rest
your
weight
on
them
but
see
on
each
side
of
the
window
is
a
marble
column
by
twisting
the
rope
around
one
of
them
i
can
let
you
slip
down
and
scarcely
feel
your
weight
and
look
she
continued
i
have
made
a
big
knot
every
ten
feet
i
can
stop
the
rope
with
them
every
now
and
then
if
i
want
to
rest
and
you
i
asked
when
you
are
down
i
shall
tie
the
rope
to
one
of
the
columns
and
follow
there
are
the
knots
on
which
to
rest
if
the
rope
cuts
my
hands
too
much
but
do
be
afraid
i
am
very
agile
at
gâo
when
i
was
just
a
child
i
used
to
climb
almost
as
high
as
this
in
the
gum
trees
to
take
the
little
toucans
out
of
their
nests
it
is
even
easier
to
climb
down
and
when
we
are
down
how
will
we
get
out
do
you
know
the
way
through
the
barriers
no
one
knows
the
way
through
the
barriers
she
said
except
and
perhaps
antinea
then
there
are
the
camels
of
those
which
he
uses
on
his
forays
i
untethered
the
strongest
one
and
led
him
out
just
below
us
and
gave
him
lots
of
hay
so
that
he
will
not
make
a
sound
and
will
be
well
fed
when
we
start
but
i
still
protested
she
stamped
her
foot
but
what
stay
if
you
wish
if
you
are
afraid
i
am
going
i
want
to
see
gâo
once
again
gâo
with
its
blue
and
its
green
water
i
felt
myself
blushing
i
will
go
i
would
rather
die
of
thirst
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
than
stay
here
let
us
start
tut
she
said
not
yet
she
showed
me
that
the
dizzy
descent
was
in
brilliant
moonlight
not
yet
we
must
wait
they
would
see
us
in
an
hour
the
moon
will
have
circled
behind
the
mountain
that
will
be
the
time
she
sat
silent
her
wrapped
completely
about
her
dark
little
figure
was
she
praying
perhaps
suddenly
i
no
longer
saw
her
darkness
had
crept
in
the
window
the
moon
had
turned
hand
was
on
my
arm
she
drew
me
toward
the
abyss
i
tried
not
to
tremble
everything
below
us
was
in
shadow
in
a
low
firm
voice
began
to
speak
everything
is
ready
i
have
twisted
the
rope
about
the
pillar
here
is
the
put
it
under
your
arms
take
this
cushion
keep
it
pressed
against
your
hurt
shoulder
a
leather
cushion
it
is
tightly
stuffed
keep
face
to
the
wall
it
will
protect
you
against
the
bumping
and
scraping
i
was
now
master
of
myself
very
calm
i
sat
down
on
the
sill
of
the
window
my
feet
in
the
void
a
breath
of
cool
air
from
the
peaks
refreshed
me
i
felt
little
hand
in
my
vest
pocket
here
is
a
box
i
must
know
when
you
are
down
so
i
can
follow
you
will
open
the
box
there
are
in
it
i
shall
see
them
and
follow
you
she
held
my
hand
a
moment
now
go
she
murmured
i
went
i
remember
only
one
thing
about
that
descent
i
was
overcome
with
vexation
when
the
rope
stopped
and
i
found
myself
feet
dangling
against
the
perfectly
smooth
wall
what
is
the
little
fool
waiting
for
i
said
to
myself
i
have
been
hung
here
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ah
at
last
oh
here
i
am
stopped
again
once
or
twice
i
thought
i
was
reaching
the
ground
but
it
was
only
a
projection
from
the
rock
i
had
to
give
a
quick
shove
with
my
foot
then
suddenly
i
found
myself
seated
on
the
ground
i
stretched
out
my
hands
bushes
a
thorn
pricked
my
finger
i
was
down
immediately
i
began
to
get
nervous
again
i
pulled
out
the
cushion
and
slipped
off
the
noose
with
my
good
hand
i
pulled
the
rope
holding
it
out
five
or
six
feet
from
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
put
my
foot
on
it
then
i
took
the
little
cardboard
box
from
my
pocket
and
opened
it
one
after
the
other
three
little
luminous
circles
rose
in
the
inky
night
i
saw
them
rise
higher
and
higher
against
the
rocky
wall
their
pale
rose
aureols
gleamed
faintly
then
one
by
one
they
turned
disappeared
you
are
tired
sidi
lieutenant
let
me
hold
the
rope
rose
up
at
my
side
i
looked
at
his
tall
black
silhouette
i
shuddered
but
i
did
not
let
go
of
the
rope
on
which
i
began
to
feel
distant
jerks
give
it
to
me
he
repeated
with
authority
and
he
took
it
from
my
hands
i
do
know
what
possessed
me
then
i
was
standing
beside
that
great
dark
phantom
and
i
ask
you
what
could
i
with
a
dislocated
shoulder
do
against
that
man
whose
agile
strength
i
already
knew
what
was
there
to
do
i
saw
him
buttressed
against
the
wall
holding
the
rope
with
both
hands
with
both
feet
with
all
his
body
much
better
than
i
had
been
able
to
do
a
rustling
above
our
heads
a
little
shadowy
form
there
said
seizing
the
little
shadow
in
his
powerful
arms
and
placing
her
on
the
ground
while
the
rope
let
slack
slapped
back
against
the
rock
recognized
the
targa
and
groaned
he
put
his
hand
roughly
over
her
mouth
shut
up
camel
thief
wretched
little
fly
he
seized
her
arm
then
he
turned
to
me
come
he
said
in
an
imperious
tone
i
obeyed
during
our
short
walk
i
heard
teeth
chattering
with
terror
we
reached
a
little
cave
go
in
said
the
targa
he
lighted
a
torch
the
red
light
showed
a
superb
mehari
peacefully
chewing
his
cud
the
little
one
is
not
stupid
said
pointing
to
the
animal
she
knows
enough
to
pick
out
the
best
and
the
strongest
but
she
is
he
held
the
torch
nearer
the
camel
she
is
he
continued
she
only
saddled
him
no
water
no
food
at
this
hour
three
days
from
now
all
three
of
you
would
have
been
dead
on
the
road
and
on
what
a
road
teeth
no
longer
chattered
she
was
looking
at
the
targa
with
a
mixture
of
terror
and
hope
come
here
sidi
lieutenant
said
so
that
i
can
explain
to
you
when
i
was
beside
him
he
said
on
each
side
there
is
a
skin
of
water
make
that
water
last
as
long
as
possible
for
you
are
going
to
cross
a
terrible
country
it
may
be
that
you
will
not
find
a
well
for
three
hundred
miles
there
he
went
on
in
the
saddle
bags
are
cans
of
preserved
meat
not
many
for
water
is
much
more
precious
here
also
is
a
carbine
your
carbine
sidi
try
not
to
use
it
except
to
shoot
antelopes
and
there
is
this
he
spread
out
a
roll
of
paper
i
saw
his
inscrutible
face
bent
over
it
his
eyes
were
smiling
he
looked
at
me
once
out
of
the
enclosures
what
way
did
you
plan
to
go
he
asked
toward
idelès
to
retake
the
route
where
you
met
the
captain
and
me
i
said
shook
his
head
i
thought
as
much
he
murmured
then
he
added
coldly
before
sunset
you
and
the
little
one
would
have
been
caught
and
massacred
toward
the
north
is
ahaggar
he
continued
and
all
ahaggar
is
under
the
control
of
antinea
you
must
go
south
then
we
shall
go
south
by
what
route
why
by
silet
and
timissao
the
targa
again
shook
his
head
they
will
look
for
you
on
that
road
also
he
said
it
is
a
good
road
the
road
with
the
wells
they
know
that
you
are
familiar
with
it
the
tuareg
would
not
fail
to
wait
at
the
wells
well
then
well
said
you
must
not
rejoin
the
road
from
timissao
to
timbuctoo
until
you
are
four
hundred
miles
from
here
toward
iferouane
or
better
still
at
the
spring
of
telemsi
that
is
the
boundary
between
the
tuareg
of
ahaggar
and
the
awellimiden
tuareg
the
little
voice
of
broke
in
it
was
the
awellimiden
tuareg
who
massacred
my
people
and
carried
me
into
slavery
i
do
not
want
to
pass
through
the
country
of
the
awellimiden
be
still
miserable
little
fly
said
then
addressing
me
he
continued
i
have
said
what
i
have
said
the
little
one
is
not
wrong
the
awellimiden
are
a
savage
people
but
they
are
afraid
of
the
french
many
of
them
trade
with
the
stations
north
of
the
niger
on
the
other
hand
they
are
at
war
with
the
people
of
ahaggar
who
will
not
follow
you
into
their
country
what
i
have
said
is
said
you
must
rejoin
the
timbuctoo
road
near
where
it
enters
the
borders
of
the
awellimiden
their
country
is
wooded
and
rich
in
springs
if
you
reach
the
springs
at
telemsi
you
will
finish
your
journey
beneath
a
canopy
of
blossoming
mimosa
on
the
other
hand
the
road
from
here
to
telemsi
is
shorter
than
by
way
of
timissao
it
is
quite
straight
yes
it
is
direct
i
said
but
in
following
it
you
have
to
cross
the
tanezruft
waved
his
hand
impatiently
knows
that
he
said
he
knows
what
the
tanezruft
is
he
who
has
traveled
over
all
the
sahara
knows
that
he
would
shudder
at
crossing
the
tanezruft
and
the
tassili
from
the
south
he
knows
that
the
camels
that
wander
into
that
country
either
die
or
become
wild
for
no
one
will
risk
his
life
to
go
look
for
them
it
is
the
terror
that
hangs
over
that
region
that
may
save
you
for
you
have
to
choose
you
must
run
the
risk
of
dying
of
thirst
on
the
tracks
of
the
tanezruft
or
have
your
throat
cut
along
some
other
route
you
can
stay
here
he
added
my
choice
is
made
i
announced
good
he
replied
again
opening
out
the
roll
of
paper
this
trail
begins
at
the
second
barrier
of
earth
to
which
i
will
lead
you
it
ends
at
iferouane
i
have
marked
the
wells
but
do
not
trust
to
them
too
much
for
many
of
them
are
dry
be
careful
not
to
stray
from
the
route
if
you
lose
it
it
is
death
now
mount
the
camel
with
the
little
one
two
make
less
noise
than
four
we
went
a
long
way
in
silence
walked
ahead
and
his
camel
followed
meekly
we
crossed
first
a
dark
passage
then
a
deep
gorge
then
another
passage
the
entrance
to
each
was
hidden
by
a
thick
tangle
of
rocks
and
briars
suddenly
a
burning
breath
touched
our
faces
a
dull
reddish
light
filtered
in
through
the
end
of
the
passage
the
desert
lay
before
us
had
stopped
get
down
he
said
a
spring
gurgled
out
of
the
rock
the
targa
went
to
it
and
filled
a
copper
cup
with
the
water
drink
he
said
holding
it
out
to
each
of
us
in
turn
we
obeyed
drink
again
he
ordered
you
will
save
just
so
much
of
the
contents
of
your
water
skins
now
try
not
to
be
thirsty
before
sunset
he
looked
over
the
saddle
girths
that
all
right
he
murmured
now
go
in
two
hours
the
dawn
will
be
here
you
must
be
out
of
sight
i
was
filled
with
emotion
at
this
last
moment
i
went
to
the
targa
and
took
his
hand
i
asked
in
a
low
voice
why
are
you
doing
this
he
stepped
back
and
i
saw
his
dark
eyes
gleam
why
he
said
yes
why
he
replied
with
dignity
the
prophet
permits
every
just
man
once
in
his
lifetime
to
let
pity
take
the
place
of
duty
is
turning
this
permission
to
the
advantage
of
one
who
saved
his
life
and
you
are
not
afraid
i
asked
that
i
will
disclose
the
secret
of
antinea
if
i
return
among
frenchmen
he
shook
his
head
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
he
said
and
his
voice
was
full
of
irony
it
is
not
to
your
interest
that
frenchmen
should
know
how
the
captain
met
his
death
i
was
horrified
at
this
logical
reply
perhaps
i
am
doing
wrong
the
targa
went
on
in
not
killing
the
little
one
but
she
loves
you
she
will
not
talk
now
go
day
is
coming
i
tried
to
press
the
hand
of
this
strange
rescuer
but
he
again
drew
back
do
not
thank
me
what
i
am
doing
i
do
to
acquire
merit
in
the
eyes
of
god
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
never
do
it
again
neither
for
you
nor
for
anyone
else
and
as
i
made
a
gesture
to
reassure
him
on
that
point
do
not
protest
he
said
in
a
tone
the
mockery
of
which
still
sounds
in
my
ears
do
not
protest
what
i
am
doing
is
of
value
to
me
but
not
to
you
i
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
not
to
you
sidi
lieutenant
not
to
you
his
grave
voice
continued
for
you
will
come
back
and
when
that
day
comes
do
not
count
on
the
help
of
i
will
come
back
i
asked
shuddering
you
will
come
back
the
targa
replied
he
was
standing
erect
a
black
statue
against
the
wall
of
gray
rock
you
will
come
back
he
repeated
with
emphasis
you
are
fleeing
now
but
you
are
mistaken
if
you
think
that
you
will
look
at
the
world
with
the
same
eyes
as
before
henceforth
one
idea
will
follow
you
everywhere
you
go
and
in
one
year
five
perhaps
ten
years
you
will
pass
again
through
the
corridor
through
which
you
have
just
come
be
still
said
the
trembling
voice
of
be
still
yourself
miserable
little
fly
said
he
sneered
the
little
one
is
afraid
because
she
knows
that
i
tell
the
truth
she
knows
the
story
of
lieutenant
ghiberti
lieutenant
ghiberti
i
said
the
sweat
standing
out
on
my
forehead
he
was
an
italian
officer
whom
i
met
between
rhât
and
rhadamès
eight
years
ago
he
did
not
believe
that
love
of
antinea
could
make
him
forget
all
else
that
life
contained
he
tried
to
escape
and
he
succeeded
i
do
not
know
how
for
i
did
not
help
him
he
went
back
to
his
country
but
hear
what
happened
two
years
later
to
the
very
day
when
i
was
leaving
the
i
discovered
a
miserable
tattered
creature
half
dead
from
hunger
and
fatigue
searching
in
vain
for
the
entrance
to
the
northern
barrier
it
was
lieutenant
ghiberti
come
back
he
fills
niche
number
in
the
red
marble
hall
the
targa
smiled
slightly
that
is
the
story
of
lieutenant
ghiberti
which
you
wished
to
hear
but
enough
of
this
mount
your
camel
i
obeyed
without
saying
a
word
seated
behind
me
put
her
little
arms
around
me
was
still
holding
the
bridle
one
word
more
he
said
pointing
to
a
black
spot
against
the
violet
sky
of
the
southern
horizon
you
see
the
there
that
is
your
way
it
is
eighteen
miles
from
here
you
should
reach
it
by
sunrise
then
consult
your
map
the
next
point
is
marked
if
you
do
not
stray
from
the
line
you
should
be
at
the
springs
of
telemsi
in
eight
days
the
camel
neck
was
stretched
toward
the
dark
wind
coming
from
the
south
the
targa
released
the
bridle
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
now
go
thank
you
i
called
to
him
turning
back
in
the
saddle
thank
you
and
farewell
i
heard
his
voice
replying
in
the
distance
lieutenant
de
saint
avit
xix
the
tanezruft
during
the
first
hour
of
our
flight
the
great
mehari
of
carried
us
at
a
mad
pace
we
covered
at
least
five
leagues
with
fixed
eyes
i
guided
the
beast
toward
the
which
the
targa
had
pointed
out
its
ridge
becoming
higher
and
higher
against
the
paling
sky
the
speed
caused
a
little
breeze
to
whistle
in
our
ears
great
tufts
of
like
fleshless
skeletons
were
tossed
to
right
and
left
i
heard
the
voice
of
whispering
stop
the
camel
at
first
i
did
not
understand
stop
him
she
repeated
her
hand
pulled
sharply
at
my
right
arm
i
obeyed
the
camel
slackened
his
pace
with
very
bad
grace
listen
she
said
at
first
i
heard
nothing
then
a
very
slight
noise
a
dry
rustling
behind
us
stop
the
camel
commanded
it
is
not
worth
while
to
make
him
kneel
a
little
gray
creature
bounded
on
the
camel
the
mehari
set
out
again
at
his
best
speed
let
him
go
said
galé
has
jumped
on
i
felt
a
tuft
of
bristly
hair
under
my
arm
the
mongoose
had
followed
our
footsteps
and
rejoined
us
i
heard
the
quick
panting
of
the
brave
little
creature
becoming
gradually
slower
and
slower
i
am
happy
murmured
had
not
been
mistaken
we
reached
the
as
the
sun
rose
i
looked
back
the
atakor
was
nothing
more
than
a
monstrous
chaos
amid
the
night
mists
which
trailed
the
dawn
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
pick
out
from
among
the
nameless
peaks
the
one
on
which
antinea
was
still
weaving
her
passionate
plots
you
know
what
the
tanezruft
is
the
plain
of
plains
abandoned
uninhabitable
the
country
of
hunger
and
thirst
we
were
then
starting
on
the
part
of
the
desert
which
duveyrier
calls
the
tassili
of
the
south
and
which
figures
on
the
maps
of
the
minister
of
public
works
under
this
attractive
title
rocky
plateau
without
water
without
vegetation
inhospitable
for
man
and
beast
nothing
unless
parts
of
the
kalahari
is
more
frightful
than
this
rocky
desert
oh
did
not
exaggerate
in
saying
that
no
one
would
dream
of
following
us
into
that
country
great
patches
of
oblivion
still
refused
to
clear
away
memories
chased
each
other
incoherently
about
my
head
a
sentence
came
back
to
me
textually
it
seemed
to
dick
that
he
had
never
since
the
beginning
of
original
darkness
done
anything
at
all
save
jolt
through
the
air
i
gave
a
little
laugh
in
the
last
few
hours
i
thought
i
have
been
heaping
up
literary
situations
a
while
ago
a
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
i
was
fabrice
of
chartreuse
de
beside
his
italian
dungeon
now
here
on
my
camel
i
am
dick
of
light
that
crossing
the
desert
to
meet
his
companions
in
arms
i
chuckled
again
then
shuddered
i
thought
of
the
preceding
night
of
the
orestes
of
who
agreed
to
sacrifice
pyrrhus
a
literary
situation
indeed
had
reckoned
eight
days
to
get
to
the
wooded
country
of
the
awellimiden
forerunners
of
the
grassy
steppes
of
the
soudan
he
knew
well
the
worth
of
his
beast
had
suddenly
given
him
a
name
the
white
one
for
the
magnificent
mehari
had
an
almost
spotless
coat
once
he
went
two
days
without
eating
merely
picking
up
here
and
there
a
branch
of
an
acacia
tree
whose
hideous
white
spines
four
inches
long
filled
me
with
fear
for
our
friend
oesophagus
the
wells
marked
out
by
were
indeed
at
the
indicated
spots
but
we
found
nothing
in
them
but
a
burning
yellow
mud
it
was
enough
for
the
camel
enough
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day
thanks
to
prodigious
we
had
used
up
only
one
of
our
two
water
skins
then
we
believed
ourselves
safe
near
one
of
these
muddy
puddles
i
succeeded
that
day
in
shooting
down
a
little
desert
gazelle
skinned
the
beast
and
we
regaled
ourselves
with
a
delicious
haunch
meantime
little
galé
who
never
ceased
prying
about
the
cracks
in
the
rocks
during
our
halts
in
the
heat
discovered
an
a
sand
crocodile
five
feet
long
and
made
short
work
of
breaking
his
neck
she
ate
so
much
she
could
not
budge
it
cost
us
a
pint
of
water
to
help
her
digestion
we
gave
it
with
good
grace
for
we
were
happy
did
not
say
so
but
her
joy
at
knowing
that
i
was
thinking
no
more
of
the
woman
in
the
gold
diadem
and
the
emeralds
was
apparent
and
really
during
those
days
i
hardly
thought
of
her
i
thought
only
of
the
torrid
heat
to
be
avoided
of
the
water
skins
which
if
you
wished
to
drink
fresh
water
had
to
be
left
for
an
hour
in
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
of
the
intense
joy
which
seized
you
when
you
raised
to
your
lips
a
leather
goblet
brimming
with
that
water
i
can
say
this
with
authority
with
good
authority
indeed
passion
spiritual
or
physical
is
a
thing
for
those
who
have
eaten
and
drunk
and
rested
it
was
five
in
the
afternoon
the
frightful
heat
was
slackening
we
had
left
a
kind
of
rocky
crevice
where
we
had
had
a
little
nap
seated
on
a
huge
rock
we
were
watching
the
reddening
west
i
spread
out
the
roll
of
paper
on
which
had
marked
the
stages
of
our
journey
as
far
as
the
road
from
the
soudan
i
realized
again
with
joy
that
his
itinerary
was
exact
and
that
i
had
followed
it
scrupulously
the
evening
of
the
day
after
i
said
we
shall
be
setting
out
on
the
stage
which
will
take
us
by
the
next
dawn
to
the
waters
at
telemsi
once
there
we
shall
not
have
to
worry
any
more
about
water
eyes
danced
in
her
thin
face
and
gâo
she
asked
we
will
be
only
a
week
from
the
niger
and
said
that
at
telemsi
one
reached
a
road
overhung
with
mimosa
i
know
the
mimosa
she
said
they
are
the
little
yellow
balls
that
melt
in
your
hand
but
i
like
the
caper
flowers
better
you
will
come
with
me
to
gâo
my
father
was
killed
as
i
told
you
by
the
awellimiden
but
my
people
must
have
rebuilt
the
villages
they
are
used
to
that
you
will
see
how
you
will
be
received
i
will
go
i
promise
you
but
you
also
you
must
promise
me
what
oh
i
guess
you
must
take
me
for
a
little
fool
if
you
believe
me
capable
of
speaking
of
things
which
might
make
trouble
for
my
friend
she
looked
at
me
as
she
spoke
privation
and
great
fatigue
had
chiselled
the
brown
face
where
her
great
eyes
shone
since
then
i
have
had
time
to
assemble
the
maps
and
compasses
and
to
fix
forever
the
spot
where
for
the
first
time
i
understood
the
beauty
of
eyes
there
was
a
deep
silence
between
us
it
was
she
who
broke
it
night
is
coming
we
must
eat
so
as
to
leave
as
soon
as
possible
she
stood
up
and
went
toward
the
rocks
almost
immediately
i
heard
her
calling
in
an
anguished
voice
that
sent
a
chill
through
me
come
oh
come
see
with
a
bound
i
was
at
her
side
the
camel
she
murmured
the
camel
i
looked
and
a
deadly
shudder
seized
me
stretched
out
at
full
length
on
the
other
side
of
the
rocks
his
pale
flanks
knotted
up
by
convulsive
spasms
lay
in
anguish
i
need
not
say
that
we
rushed
to
him
in
feverish
haste
of
what
was
dying
i
did
not
know
i
never
have
known
all
the
mehara
are
that
way
they
are
at
once
the
most
enduring
and
the
most
delicate
of
beasts
they
will
travel
for
six
months
across
the
most
frightful
deserts
with
little
food
without
water
and
seem
only
the
better
for
it
then
one
day
when
nothing
is
the
matter
they
stretch
out
and
give
you
the
slip
with
disconcerting
ease
when
and
i
saw
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
we
stood
there
without
a
word
watching
his
slackening
spasms
when
he
breathed
his
last
we
felt
that
our
life
as
well
as
his
had
gone
it
was
who
spoke
first
how
far
are
we
from
the
soudan
road
she
asked
we
are
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
from
the
springs
of
telemsi
i
replied
we
could
make
thirty
miles
by
going
toward
iferouane
but
the
wells
are
not
marked
on
that
route
then
we
must
walk
toward
the
springs
of
telemsi
she
said
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
that
makes
seven
days
seven
days
at
the
least
how
far
is
it
to
the
first
well
miles
the
little
girl
face
contracted
somewhat
but
she
braced
up
quickly
we
must
set
out
at
once
set
out
on
foot
she
stamped
her
foot
i
marveled
to
see
her
so
strong
we
must
go
she
repeated
we
are
going
to
eat
and
drink
and
make
galé
eat
and
drink
for
we
can
not
carry
all
the
tins
and
the
water
skin
is
so
heavy
that
we
should
not
get
three
miles
if
we
tried
to
carry
it
we
will
put
a
little
water
in
one
of
the
tins
after
emptying
it
through
a
little
hole
that
will
be
enough
for
stage
which
will
be
eighteen
miles
without
water
we
will
set
out
for
another
eighteen
miles
and
we
will
reach
the
wells
marked
on
the
paper
by
oh
i
murmured
sadly
if
my
shoulder
were
only
not
this
way
i
could
carry
the
water
skin
it
is
as
it
is
said
you
will
take
your
carbine
and
two
tins
of
meat
i
shall
take
two
more
and
the
one
filled
with
water
come
we
must
leave
in
an
hour
if
we
wish
to
cover
the
eighteen
miles
you
know
that
when
the
sun
is
up
the
rocks
are
so
hot
we
can
not
walk
i
leave
you
to
imagine
in
what
sad
silence
we
passed
that
hour
which
we
had
begun
so
happily
and
confidently
without
the
little
girl
i
believe
i
should
have
seated
myself
upon
a
rock
and
waited
galé
only
was
happy
we
must
not
let
her
eat
too
much
said
she
would
not
be
able
to
follow
us
and
she
must
work
if
she
catches
another
it
will
be
for
us
you
have
walked
in
the
desert
you
know
how
terrible
the
first
hours
of
the
night
are
when
the
moon
comes
up
huge
and
yellow
a
sharp
dust
seems
to
rise
in
suffocating
clouds
you
move
your
jaws
mechanically
as
if
to
crush
the
dust
that
finds
its
way
into
your
throat
like
fire
then
usually
a
kind
of
lassitude
of
drowsiness
follows
you
walk
without
thinking
you
forget
where
you
are
walking
you
remember
only
when
you
stumble
of
course
you
stumble
often
but
anyway
it
is
bearable
the
night
is
ending
you
say
and
with
it
the
march
all
in
all
i
am
less
tired
than
at
the
beginning
the
night
ends
but
then
comes
the
most
terrible
hour
of
all
you
are
perishing
of
thirst
and
shaking
with
cold
all
the
fatigue
comes
back
at
once
the
horrible
breeze
which
precedes
the
dawn
is
no
comfort
quite
the
contrary
every
time
you
stumble
you
say
the
next
misstep
will
be
the
last
that
is
what
people
feel
and
say
even
when
they
know
that
in
a
few
hours
they
will
have
a
good
rest
with
food
and
water
i
was
suffering
terribly
every
step
jolted
my
poor
shoulder
at
one
time
i
wanted
to
stop
to
sit
down
then
i
looked
at
she
was
walking
ahead
with
her
eyes
almost
closed
her
expression
was
an
indefinable
one
of
mingled
suffering
and
determination
i
closed
my
own
eyes
and
went
on
such
was
the
first
stage
at
dawn
we
stopped
in
a
hollow
in
the
rocks
soon
the
heat
forced
us
to
rise
to
seek
a
deeper
one
did
not
eat
instead
she
swallowed
a
little
of
her
half
can
of
water
she
lay
drowsy
all
day
galé
ran
about
our
rock
giving
plaintive
little
cries
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
about
the
second
march
it
was
more
horrible
than
anything
you
can
imagine
i
suffered
all
that
it
is
humanly
possible
to
suffer
in
the
desert
but
already
i
began
to
observe
with
infinite
pity
that
my
man
strength
was
outlasting
the
nervous
force
of
my
little
companion
the
poor
child
walked
on
without
saying
a
word
chewing
feebly
one
corner
of
her
which
she
had
drawn
over
her
face
galé
followed
the
well
toward
which
we
were
dragging
ourselves
was
indicated
on
paper
by
the
one
word
is
the
plural
of
and
means
two
isolated
trees
day
was
dawning
when
finally
i
saw
the
two
trees
two
gum
trees
hardly
a
league
separated
us
from
them
i
gave
a
cry
of
joy
courage
there
is
the
well
she
drew
her
veil
aside
and
i
saw
the
poor
anguished
little
face
so
much
the
better
she
murmured
because
otherwise
she
could
not
even
finish
the
sentence
we
finished
the
last
half
mile
almost
at
a
run
we
already
saw
the
hole
the
opening
of
the
well
finally
we
reached
it
it
was
empty
it
is
a
strange
sensation
to
be
dying
of
thirst
at
first
the
suffering
is
terrible
then
gradually
it
becomes
less
you
become
partly
unconscious
ridiculous
little
things
about
your
life
occur
to
you
fly
about
you
like
mosquitoes
i
began
to
remember
my
history
composition
for
the
entrance
examination
of
the
campaign
of
marengo
obstinately
i
repeated
to
myself
i
have
already
said
that
the
battery
unmasked
by
marmont
at
the
moment
of
charge
included
eighteen
pieces
no
i
remember
now
it
was
only
twelve
pieces
i
am
sure
it
was
twelve
pieces
i
kept
on
repeating
twelve
pieces
then
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
coma
i
was
recalled
from
it
by
feeling
a
iron
on
my
forehead
i
opened
my
eyes
was
bending
over
me
it
was
her
hand
which
burnt
so
get
up
she
said
we
must
go
on
go
on
the
desert
is
on
fire
the
sun
is
at
the
zenith
it
is
noon
we
must
go
on
she
repeated
then
i
saw
that
she
was
delirious
she
was
standing
erect
her
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
little
galé
rolled
up
in
a
ball
was
asleep
on
it
bareheaded
indifferent
to
the
frightful
sunlight
she
kept
repeating
we
must
go
on
a
little
sense
came
back
to
me
cover
your
head
cover
your
head
come
she
repeated
let
go
gâo
is
over
there
not
far
away
i
can
feel
it
i
want
to
see
gâo
again
i
made
her
sit
down
beside
me
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
i
realized
that
all
strength
had
left
her
the
wave
of
pity
that
swept
over
me
brought
back
my
senses
gâo
is
just
over
there
is
it
she
asked
her
gleaming
eyes
became
imploring
yes
dear
little
girl
gâo
is
there
but
for
god
sake
lie
down
the
sun
is
fearful
oh
gâo
gâo
she
repeated
i
know
very
well
that
i
shall
see
gâo
again
she
sat
up
her
fiery
little
hands
gripped
mine
listen
i
must
tell
you
so
you
can
understand
how
i
know
i
shall
see
gâo
again
be
quiet
my
little
girl
be
quiet
no
i
must
tell
you
a
long
time
ago
on
the
bank
of
the
river
where
there
is
water
at
gâo
where
my
father
was
a
prince
there
was
well
one
day
one
feast
day
there
came
from
the
interior
of
the
country
an
old
magician
dressed
in
skins
and
feathers
with
a
mask
and
a
pointed
with
castanets
and
two
serpents
in
a
bag
on
the
village
square
where
all
our
people
formed
in
a
circle
he
danced
the
i
was
in
the
first
row
and
because
i
had
a
necklace
of
pink
tourmaline
he
quickly
saw
that
i
was
the
daughter
of
a
chief
so
he
spoke
to
me
of
the
past
of
the
great
mandingue
empire
over
which
my
grandfathers
had
ruled
of
our
enemies
the
fierce
kountas
of
everything
and
finally
he
said
no
fear
little
girl
then
he
said
again
not
be
afraid
evil
days
may
be
in
store
for
you
but
what
does
that
matter
for
one
day
you
will
see
gâo
gleaming
on
the
horizon
no
longer
a
servile
gâo
reduced
to
the
rank
of
a
little
negro
town
but
the
splendid
gâo
of
other
days
the
great
capital
of
the
country
of
the
blacks
gâo
reborn
with
its
mosque
of
seven
towers
and
fourteen
cupolas
of
turquoise
with
its
houses
with
cool
courts
its
fountains
its
watered
gardens
all
blooming
with
great
red
and
white
flowers
that
will
be
for
you
the
hour
of
deliverance
and
of
royalty
was
standing
up
all
about
us
on
our
heads
the
sun
blazed
on
the
burning
it
white
suddenly
the
child
stretched
out
her
arms
she
gave
a
terrible
cry
gâo
there
is
gâo
i
looked
at
her
gâo
she
repeated
oh
i
know
it
well
there
are
the
trees
and
the
fountains
the
cupolas
and
the
towers
the
palm
trees
the
great
red
and
white
flowers
gâo
indeed
along
the
shimmering
horizon
rose
a
fantastic
city
with
mighty
buildings
that
towered
tier
on
tier
until
they
formed
a
rainbow
we
stood
and
watched
the
terrible
mirage
quiver
feverishly
before
us
gâo
i
cried
gâo
and
almost
immediately
i
uttered
another
cry
of
sorrow
and
of
horror
little
hand
relaxed
in
mine
i
had
just
time
to
catch
the
child
in
my
arms
and
hear
her
murmur
as
in
a
whisper
and
then
that
will
be
the
day
of
deliverance
the
day
of
deliverance
and
of
royalty
several
hours
later
i
took
the
knife
with
which
we
had
skinned
the
desert
gazelle
and
in
the
sand
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
where
had
given
up
her
spirit
i
made
a
little
hollow
where
she
was
to
rest
when
everything
was
ready
i
wanted
to
look
once
more
at
that
dear
little
face
courage
failed
me
for
a
moment
then
i
quickly
drew
the
over
the
brown
face
and
laid
the
body
of
the
child
in
the
hollow
i
had
reckoned
without
galé
the
eyes
of
the
mongoose
had
not
left
me
during
the
whole
time
that
i
was
about
my
sad
duty
when
she
heard
the
first
handfuls
of
sand
fall
on
the
she
gave
a
sharp
cry
i
looked
at
her
and
saw
her
ready
to
spring
her
eyes
daring
fire
galé
i
implored
and
i
tried
to
stroke
her
she
bit
my
hand
and
then
leapt
into
the
grave
and
began
to
dig
throwing
the
sand
furiously
aside
i
tried
three
times
to
chase
her
away
i
felt
that
i
should
never
finish
my
task
and
that
even
if
i
did
galé
would
stay
there
and
disinter
the
body
my
carbine
lay
at
my
feet
a
shot
drew
echoes
from
the
immense
empty
desert
a
moment
later
galé
also
slept
her
last
sleep
curled
up
as
i
so
often
had
seen
her
against
the
neck
of
her
mistress
when
the
surface
showed
nothing
more
than
a
little
mound
of
trampled
sand
i
rose
staggering
and
started
off
aimlessly
into
the
desert
toward
the
south
xx
the
circle
is
complete
at
the
foot
of
the
valley
of
the
mia
at
the
place
where
the
jackal
had
cried
the
night
told
me
he
had
killed
morhange
another
jackal
or
perhaps
the
same
one
howled
again
immediately
i
had
a
feeling
that
this
night
would
see
the
irremediable
fulfilled
we
were
seated
that
evening
as
before
on
the
poor
veranda
improvised
outside
our
the
floor
was
of
plaster
the
balustrade
of
twisted
branches
four
posts
supported
a
thatched
roof
i
have
already
said
that
from
the
veranda
one
could
look
far
out
over
the
desert
as
he
finished
speaking
rose
and
stood
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
railing
i
followed
him
and
then
i
said
he
looked
at
me
and
then
what
surely
you
know
what
all
the
newspapers
told
how
in
the
country
of
the
awellimiden
i
was
found
dying
of
hunger
and
thirst
by
an
expedition
under
the
command
of
captain
aymard
and
taken
to
timbuctoo
i
was
delirious
for
a
month
afterward
i
have
never
known
what
i
may
have
said
during
those
spells
of
burning
fever
you
may
be
sure
the
officers
of
the
timbuctoo
club
did
not
feel
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
tell
me
when
i
told
them
of
my
adventures
as
they
are
related
in
the
report
of
the
morhange
expedition
i
could
see
well
enough
from
the
cold
politeness
with
which
they
received
my
explanations
that
the
official
version
which
i
gave
them
differed
at
certain
points
from
the
fragments
which
had
escaped
me
in
my
delirium
they
did
not
press
the
matter
it
remains
understood
that
captain
morhange
died
from
a
sunstroke
and
that
i
buried
him
on
the
border
of
the
tarhit
watercourse
three
marches
from
timissao
everybody
can
detect
that
there
are
things
missing
in
my
story
doubtless
they
guess
at
some
mysterious
drama
but
proofs
are
another
matter
because
of
the
impossibility
of
collecting
them
they
prefer
to
smother
what
could
only
become
a
silly
scandal
but
now
you
know
all
the
details
as
well
as
i
and
she
i
asked
timidly
he
smiled
triumphantly
it
was
triumph
at
having
led
me
to
think
no
longer
of
morhange
or
of
his
crime
the
triumph
of
feeling
that
he
had
succeeded
in
imbuing
me
with
his
own
madness
yes
he
said
she
for
six
years
i
have
learned
nothing
more
about
her
but
i
see
her
i
talk
with
her
i
am
thinking
now
how
i
shall
reenter
her
presence
i
shall
throw
myself
at
her
feet
and
say
simply
me
i
rebelled
against
your
law
i
did
not
know
but
now
i
know
and
you
see
that
like
lieutenant
ghiberti
i
have
come
back
honor
country
said
old
le
mesge
will
forget
all
for
her
old
le
mesge
is
a
stupid
man
but
he
speaks
from
experience
he
knows
he
who
has
seen
broken
before
antinea
the
wills
of
the
fifty
ghosts
in
the
red
marble
hall
and
now
will
you
in
your
turn
ask
me
is
this
woman
do
i
know
myself
and
besides
what
difference
does
it
make
what
does
her
past
and
the
mystery
of
her
origin
matter
to
me
what
does
it
matter
whether
she
is
the
true
descendant
of
the
god
of
the
sea
and
the
sublime
lagides
or
the
bastard
of
a
polish
drunkard
and
a
harlot
of
the
marbeuf
quarter
at
the
time
when
i
was
foolish
enough
to
be
jealous
of
morhange
these
questions
might
have
made
some
difference
to
the
ridiculous
that
civilized
people
mix
up
with
passion
but
i
have
held
antinea
body
in
my
arms
i
no
longer
wish
to
know
any
other
nor
if
the
fields
are
in
blossom
nor
what
will
become
of
the
human
spirit
i
do
not
wish
to
know
or
rather
it
is
because
i
have
too
exact
a
vision
of
that
future
that
i
pretend
to
destroy
myself
in
the
only
destiny
that
is
worth
while
a
nature
unfathomed
and
virgin
a
mysterious
love
nature
unfathomed
and
i
must
explain
myself
one
winter
day
in
a
large
city
all
streaked
with
the
soot
that
falls
from
black
chimneys
of
factories
and
of
those
horrible
houses
in
the
suburbs
i
attended
a
funeral
we
followed
the
hearse
in
the
mud
the
church
was
new
damp
and
poor
aside
from
two
or
three
people
relatives
struck
down
by
a
dull
sorrow
everyone
had
just
one
idea
to
find
some
pretext
to
get
away
those
who
went
as
far
as
the
cemetery
were
those
who
did
not
find
an
excuse
i
see
the
gray
walls
and
the
cypresses
those
trees
of
sun
and
shade
so
beautiful
in
the
country
of
southern
france
against
the
low
purple
hills
i
see
the
horrible
undertaker
men
in
greasy
jackets
and
shiny
top
hats
i
see
no
i
stop
it
too
horrible
near
the
wall
in
a
remote
plot
a
grave
had
been
dug
in
frightful
yellow
pebbly
clay
it
was
there
that
they
left
the
dead
man
whose
name
i
no
longer
remember
while
they
were
lowering
the
casket
i
looked
at
my
hands
those
hands
which
in
that
strangely
lighted
country
had
pressed
the
hands
of
antinea
a
great
pity
for
my
body
seized
me
a
great
fear
of
what
threatened
it
in
these
cities
of
mud
i
said
to
myself
may
be
that
this
body
this
dear
body
will
come
to
such
an
end
no
no
my
body
precious
above
all
other
treasures
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
spare
you
that
ignominy
you
shall
not
rot
under
a
registered
number
in
the
filth
of
a
suburban
cemetery
your
brothers
in
love
the
fifty
knights
of
orichalch
await
you
mute
and
grave
in
the
red
marble
hall
i
shall
take
you
back
to
them
a
shame
to
him
who
retails
the
secrets
of
his
loves
the
sahara
lays
its
impassable
barrier
about
antinea
that
is
why
the
most
unreasonable
requirements
of
this
woman
are
in
reality
more
modest
and
chaste
than
your
marriage
will
be
with
its
vulgar
public
show
the
bans
the
invitations
the
announcements
telling
an
and
joking
people
that
after
such
and
such
an
hour
on
such
and
such
a
day
you
will
have
the
right
to
violate
your
little
tupenny
virgin
i
think
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
you
no
there
is
still
one
thing
more
i
told
you
a
while
ago
about
the
red
marble
hall
south
of
cherchell
to
the
west
of
the
mazafran
river
on
a
hill
which
in
the
early
morning
emerges
from
the
mists
of
the
mitidja
there
is
a
mysterious
stone
pyramid
the
natives
call
it
tomb
of
the
christian
that
is
where
the
body
of
antinea
ancestress
that
cleopatra
selene
daughter
of
mark
antony
and
cleopatra
was
laid
to
rest
though
it
is
placed
in
the
path
of
invasions
this
tomb
has
kept
its
treasure
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
discover
the
painted
room
where
the
beautiful
body
reposes
in
a
glass
casket
all
that
the
ancestress
has
been
able
to
do
the
descendant
will
be
able
to
surpass
in
grim
magnificence
in
the
center
of
the
red
marble
hall
on
the
rock
whence
comes
the
plaint
of
the
gloomy
fountain
a
platform
is
reserved
it
is
there
on
an
orichalch
throne
with
the
egyptian
and
the
golden
serpent
on
her
brow
and
the
trident
of
neptune
in
her
hand
that
the
marvelous
woman
i
have
told
you
about
will
be
ensconced
on
that
day
when
the
hundred
and
twenty
niches
hollowed
out
in
a
circle
around
her
throne
shall
each
have
received
its
willing
prey
when
i
left
ahaggar
you
remember
that
it
was
niche
number
that
was
to
be
mine
since
then
i
have
never
stopped
calculating
and
i
conclude
that
it
is
in
number
or
that
i
shall
repose
but
any
calculations
based
upon
so
fragile
a
foundation
as
a
woman
whim
may
be
erroneous
that
is
why
i
am
getting
more
and
more
nervous
must
hurry
i
tell
myself
must
hurry
i
must
hurry
i
repeated
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
he
raised
his
head
with
an
indefinable
expression
of
joy
his
hand
trembled
with
happiness
when
he
shook
mine
you
will
see
he
repeated
excitedly
you
will
see
ecstatically
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
held
me
there
a
long
moment
an
extraordinary
happiness
swept
over
both
of
us
while
alternately
laughing
and
crying
like
children
we
kept
repeating
we
must
hurry
we
must
hurry
suddenly
there
sprang
up
a
slight
breeze
that
made
the
tufts
of
thatch
in
the
roof
rustle
the
sky
pale
lilac
grew
paler
still
and
suddenly
a
great
yellow
rent
tore
it
in
the
east
dawn
broke
over
the
empty
desert
from
within
the
stockade
came
dull
noises
a
bugle
call
the
rattle
of
chains
the
post
was
waking
up
for
several
seconds
we
stood
there
silent
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
southern
route
by
which
one
reaches
temassinin
eguéré
and
ahaggar
a
rap
on
the
door
behind
us
made
us
start
come
in
said
andré
de
in
a
voice
which
had
become
suddenly
hard
the
quartermaster
chatelain
stood
before
us
what
do
you
want
of
me
at
this
hour
asked
brusquely
the
stood
at
attention
excuse
me
captain
but
a
native
was
discovered
near
the
post
last
night
by
the
patrol
he
was
not
trying
to
hide
as
soon
as
he
had
been
brought
here
he
asked
to
be
led
before
the
commanding
officer
it
was
midnight
and
i
did
want
to
disturb
you
who
is
this
native
a
targa
captain
a
targa
go
get
him
chatelain
stepped
aside
escorted
by
one
of
our
native
soldiers
the
man
stood
behind
him
they
came
out
on
the
terrace
the
new
arrival
six
feet
tall
was
indeed
a
targa
the
light
of
dawn
fell
upon
his
cotton
robes
one
could
see
his
great
dark
eyes
flashing
when
he
was
opposite
my
companion
i
saw
a
tremor
immediately
suppressed
run
through
both
men
they
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
in
silence
then
bowing
and
in
a
very
calm
voice
the
targa
spoke
peace
be
with
you
lieutenant
de
in
the
same
calm
voice
andré
answered
him
peace
be
with
you
transcriber
notes
the
original
books
there
were
handwritten
characters
for
the
greek
words
used
in
the
discussion
of
the
tifinar
engravings
the
approximate
greek
transliterations
have
been
substituted
another
inscription
was
in
the
book
and
the
center
symbol
looks
like
a
capital

to
that

where
the
symbol
