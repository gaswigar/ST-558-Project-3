scene
ii
in

asleep
the
morning
light
is
coming
through
the

the
time
is
eight
wheeler
brisk
person
enters
with
a
and
jones
more
slowly
with
a
scuttle
wheeler
drawing
the
curtains
that
precious
husband
of
yours
was
round
for
you
after
you
gone
yesterday
jones
wanted
your
money
for
drink
i
suppose
he
hangs
about
the
corner
here
half
the
time
i
saw
him
outside
the
goat
and
bells
when
i
went
to
the
post
last
night
if
i
were
you
i
would
live
with
him
i
would
live
with
a
man
that
raised
his
hand
to
me
i
put
up
with
it
why
do
you
take
your
children
and
leave
him
if
you
put
up
with
it
only
make
him
worse
i
never
can
see
why
because
a
man
married
you
he
should
knock
you
about
jones
slim
and
and
with
a
smooth
soft
even
voice
her
manner
patient
her
way
of
talking
quite
impersonal
she
wears
a
blue
linen
dress
and
boots
with
holes
it
was
nearly
two
last
night
before
he
come
home
and
he
was
himself
he
made
me
get
up
and
he
knocked
me
about
he
did
seem
to
know
what
he
was
saying
or
doing
of
course
i
would
leave
him
but
i
really
afraid
of
what
he
do
to
me
he
such
a
violent
man
when
he
not
himself
wheeler
why
do
you
get
him
locked
up
you
never
have
any
peace
until
you
get
him
locked
up
if
i
were
you
i
go
to
the
police
court
tomorrow
that
what
i
would
do
jones
of
course
i
ought
to
go
because
he
does
treat
me
so
badly
when
he
not
himself
but
you
see
bettina
he
has
a
very
hard
time
he
been
out
of
work
two
months
and
it
preys
upon
his
mind
when
he
in
work
he
behaves
himself
much
better
it
when
he
out
of
work
that
he
so
violent
wheeler
well
if
you
wo
take
any
steps
you
never
get
rid
of
him
jones
of
course
it
very
wearing
to
me
i
do
get
my
sleep
at
nights
and
it
not
as
if
i
were
getting
help
from
him
because
i
have
to
do
for
the
children
and
all
of
us
and
he
throws
such
dreadful
things
up
at
me
talks
of
my
having
men
to
follow
me
about
such
a
thing
never
happens
no
man
ever
speaks
to
me
and
of
course
it
just
the
other
way
it
what
he
does
that
wrong
and
makes
me
so
unhappy
and
then
he
always
threatenin
to
cut
my
throat
if
i
leave
him
it
all
the
drink
and
things
preying
on
his
mind
he
not
a
bad
man
really
sometimes
he
speak
quite
kind
to
me
but
i
stood
so
much
from
him
i
do
feel
it
in
me
to
speak
kind
back
but
just
keep
myself
to
myself
and
he
all
right
with
the
children
too
except
when
he
not
himself
wheeler
you
mean
when
he
drunk
the
beauty
jones
yes
without
change
of
voice
there
the
young
gentleman
asleep
on
the
sofa
they
both
look
silently
at
jack
jones
at
last
in
her
soft
voice
he
does
look
quite
himself
wheeler
he
a
young
limb
that
what
he
is
it
my
belief
he
was
tipsy
last
night
like
your
husband
it
another
kind
of
bein
out
of
work
that
sets
him
to
drink
i
go
and
tell
marlow
this
is
his
job
she
goes
jones
upon
her
knees
begins
a
gentle
sweeping
jack
waking
who
there
what
is
it
jones
it
me
sir
jones
jack
sitting
up
and
looking
round
where
is
it
what
what
time
is
it
jones
it
getting
on
for
nine
sir
jack
for
nine
why
what
rising
and
loosening
his
tongue
putting
hands
to
his
head
and
staring
hard
at
mrs
jones
look
here
you
jones
do
you
say
you
caught
me
asleep
here
jones
no
sir
of
course
i
wo
sir
jack
it
quite
an
accident
i
do
know
how
it
happened
i
must
have
forgotten
to
go
to
bed
it
a
queer
thing
i
got
a
most
beastly
headache
mind
you
do
say
anything
jones
goes
out
and
passes
marlow
in
the
doorway
marlow
is
young
and
quiet
he
is
cleanshaven
and
his
hair
is
brushed
high
from
his
forehead
in
a
coxcomb
incidentally
a
butler
he
is
first
a
man
he
looks
at
jones
and
smiles
a
private
smile
marlow
not
the
first
time
and
wo
be
the
last
looked
a
bit
dicky
eh
jones
jones
he
did
look
quite
himself
of
course
i
did
take
notice
marlow
you
used
to
them
how
your
old
man
jones
softly
as
throughout
well
he
was
very
bad
last
night
he
did
seem
to
know
what
he
was
about
he
was
very
late
and
he
was
most
abusive
but
now
of
course
he
asleep
marlow
that
his
way
of
finding
a
job
eh
jones
as
a
rule
marlow
he
goes
out
early
every
morning
looking
for
work
and
sometimes
he
comes
in
fit
to
drop
and
of
course
i
ca
say
he
does
try
to
get
it
because
he
does
trade
very
bad
she
stands
quite
still
her
fan
and
brush
before
her
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
long
vistas
of
experience
traversing
them
with
her
impersonal
eye
but
he
not
a
good
husband
to
me
last
night
he
hit
me
and
he
was
so
dreadfully
abusive
marlow
bank
eh
he
too
fond
of
the
goat
and
bells
that
what
the
matter
with
him
i
see
him
at
the
corner
late
every
night
he
hangs
about
jones
he
gets
to
feeling
very
low
walking
about
all
day
after
work
and
being
refused
so
often
and
then
when
he
gets
a
drop
in
him
it
goes
to
his
head
but
he
should
treat
his
wife
as
he
treats
me
sometimes
i
had
to
go
and
walk
about
at
night
when
he
would
let
me
stay
in
the
room
but
he
sorry
for
it
afterwards
and
he
hangs
about
after
me
he
waits
for
me
in
the
street
and
i
do
think
he
ought
to
because
i
always
been
a
good
wife
to
him
and
i
tell
him
barthwick
would
like
him
coming
about
the
place
but
that
only
makes
him
angry
and
he
says
dreadful
things
about
the
gentry
of
course
it
was
through
me
that
he
first
lost
his
place
through
his
not
treating
me
right
and
that
made
him
bitter
against
the
gentry
he
had
a
very
good
place
as
groom
in
the
country
but
it
made
such
a
stir
because
of
course
he
did
treat
me
right
marlow
got
the
sack
jones
yes
his
employer
said
he
could
keep
him
because
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
and
he
said
it
was
such
a
bad
example
but
it
very
important
for
me
to
keep
my
work
here
i
have
the
three
children
and
i
do
want
him
to
come
about
after
me
in
the
streets
and
make
a
disturbance
as
he
sometimes
does
marlow
holding
up
the
empty
decanter
not
a
drain
next
time
he
hits
you
get
a
witness
and
go
down
to
the
court
jones
yes
i
think
i
made
up
my
mind
i
think
i
ought
to
marlow
that
right
where
the
ciga
he
searches
for
the
silver
box
he
looks
at
jones
who
is
sweeping
on
her
hands
and
knees
he
checks
himself
and
stands
reflecting
from
the
tray
he
picks
two
cigarettes
and
reads
the
name
on
them
nestor
where
the
deuce
with
a
meditative
air
he
looks
again
at
jones
and
taking
up
jack
overcoat
he
searches
in
the
pockets
wheeler
with
a
tray
of
breakfast
things
comes
in
marlow
aside
to
wheeler
have
you
seen
the
wheeler
no
marlow

i
put
it
on
the
tray
last
night
and
he

smoking
showing
her

ends
of
cigarettes

not
in
these
pockets
he
ca
have
taken
it
upstairs
this
morning

a
good
look
in
his
room
when
he
comes
down
who

jones
jones
i
finished
here

i
do
the
now

looking
at
her
doubtfully
have
you
seen
better
do
the
boudwower
first
jones
goes
out
with
pan
and
brush
marlow
and
wheeler
look
each
other
in
the
face
marlow
it
turn
up
wheeler
hesitating
you
do
think
she
nodding
at
the
door
marlow
stoutly
i
do
i
never
believes

of
anybody

but
the
master
have
to
be
told
marlow
you
wait
a
bit
and
see
if
it
do
turn
up
no
business
of
ours
i
set
my
mind
against
it
the
curtain
falls
the
curtain
rises
again
at
once
scene
iii
barthwick
and
barthwick
are
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
he
is
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
quietly
important
with
a
bald
forehead
and
and
the
times
in
his
hand
she
is
a
lady
of
nearly
fifty
well
dressed
with
greyish
hair
good
features
and
a
decided
manner
they
face
each
other
barthwick
from
behind
his
paper
the
labour
man
has
got
in
at
the
for
barnside
my
dear
barthwick
another
labour
i
ca
think
what
on
earth
the
country
is
about
barthwick
i
predicted
it
it
not
a
matter
of
vast
importance
barthwick
not
how
can
you
take
it
so
calmly
john
to
me
it
simply
outrageous
and
there
you
sit
you
liberals
and
pretend
to
encourage
these
people
barthwick
frowning
the
representation
of
all
parties
is
necessary
for
any
proper
reform
for
any
proper
social
policy
barthwick
i
no
patience
with
your
talk
of
reform
all
that
nonsense
about
social
policy
we
know
perfectly
well
what
it
is
they
want
they
want
things
for
themselves
those
socialists
and
labour
men
are
an
absolutely
selfish
set
of
people
they
have
no
sense
of
patriotism
like
the
upper
classes
they
simply
want
what
we
got
barthwick
want
what
we
got
he
stares
into
space
my
dear
what
are
you
talking
about
with
a
contortion
i
no
alarmist
barthwick
cream
quite
uneducated
men
wait
until
they
begin
to
tax
our
investments
i
convinced
that
when
they
once
get
a
chance
they
will
tax
everything
they
no
feeling
for
the
country
you
liberals
and
conservatives
you
all
alike
you
do
see
an
inch
before
your
noses
you
no
imagination
not
a
scrap
of
imagination
between
you
you
ought
to
join
hands
and
nip
it
in
the
bud
barthwick
you
talking
nonsense
how
is
it
possible
for
liberals
and
conservatives
to
join
hands
as
you
call
it
that
shows
how
absurd
it
is
for
women
why
the
very
essence
of
a
liberal
is
to
trust
in
the
people
barthwick
now
john
eat
your
breakfast
as
if
there
were
any
real
difference
between
you
and
the
conservatives
all
the
upper
classes
have
the
same
interests
to
protect
and
the
same
principles
calmly
oh
you
sitting
upon
a
volcano
john
barthwick
what
barthwick
i
read
a
letter
in
the
paper
yesterday
i
forget
the
man
name
but
it
made
the
whole
thing
perfectly
clear
you
do
look
things
in
the
face
barthwick
indeed
heavily
i
am
a
liberal
drop
the
subject
please
barthwick
toast
i
quite
agree
with
what
this
man
says
education
is
simply
ruining
the
lower
classes
it
unsettles
them
and
that
the
worst
thing
for
us
all
i
see
an
enormous
difference
in
the
manner
of
servants
barthwick
with
suspicious
emphasis
i
welcome
any
change
that
will
lead
to
something
better
he
opens
a
letter
h
this
is
that
affair
of
master
jack
again
high
street
oxford
sir
we
have
received
john
barthwick
senior
draft
for
forty
pounds
oh
the
letter
to
him
we
now
enclose
the
cheque
you
cashed
with
us
which
as
we
stated
in
our
previous
letter
was
not
met
on
presentation
at
your
bank
we
are
sir
yours
obediently
moss
and
sons
tailors
h
staring
at
the
cheque
a
pretty
business
altogether
the
boy
might
have
been
prosecuted
barthwick
come
john
you
know
jack
did
mean
anything
he
only
thought
he
was
overdrawing
i
still
think
his
bank
ought
to
have
cashed
that
cheque
they
must
know
your
position
barthwick
replacing
in
the
envelope
the
letter
and
the
cheque
much
good
that
would
have
done
him
in
a
court
of
law
he
stops
as
jack
comes
in
fastening
his
waistcoat
and
staunching
a
razor
cut
upon
his
chin
jack
sitting
down
between
them
and
speaking
with
an
artificial
joviality
sorry
i
late
he
looks
lugubriously
at
the
dishes
tea
please
mother
any
letters
for
me
barthwick
hands
the
letter
to
him
but
look
here
i
say
this
has
been
opened
i
do
wish
you
would
barthwick
touching
the
envelope
i
suppose
i
entitled
to
this
name
jack
sulkily
well
i
ca
help
having
your
name
father
he
reads
the
letter
and
mutters
brutes
barthwick
eyeing
him
you
do
deserve
to
be
so
well
out
of
that
jack
have
you
ragged
me
enough
dad
barthwick
yes
john
let
jack
have
his
breakfast
barthwick
if
you
had
had
me
to
come
to
where
would
you
have
been
it
the
merest
accident
suppose
you
had
been
the
son
of
a
poor
man
or
a
clerk
obtaining
money
with
a
cheque
you
knew
your
bank
could
not
meet
it
might
have
ruined
you
for
life
i
see
what
to
become
of
you
if
these
are
your
principles
i
never
did
anything
of
the
sort
myself
jack
i
expect
you
always
had
lots
of
money
if
you
got
plenty
of
money
of
course
barthwick
on
the
contrary
i
had
not
your
advantages
my
father
kept
me
very
short
of
money
jack
how
much
had
you
dad
barthwick
it
not
material
the
question
is
do
you
feel
the
gravity
of
what
you
did
jack
i
do
know
about
the
gravity
of
course
i
very
sorry
if
you
think
it
was
wrong
have
i
said
so
i
should
never
have
done
it
at
all
if
i
had
been
so
jolly
hard
up
barthwick
how
much
of
that
forty
pounds
have
you
got
left
jack
jack
hesitating
i
do
know
not
much
barthwick
how
much
jack
desperately
i
have
got
any
barthwick
what
jack
i
know
i
got
the
most
beastly
headache
he
leans
his
head
on
his
hand
barthwick
headache
my
dear
boy

you
eat
any
breakfast
jack
drawing
in
his
breath
too
jolly
bad
barthwick
i
so
sorry
come
with
me
dear
i
give
you
something
that
will
take
it
away
at
once
they
leave
the
room
and
barthwick
tearing
up
the
letter
goes
to
the
fireplace
and
puts
the
pieces
in
the
fire
while
he
is
doing
this
marlow

a
minute

time

gesture
of
dismay

this
jones

here
the
whole
morning

h
is

marlow
yes
sir
barthwick
very
good
i
shall
make
a
point
of
clearing
this
up
on
principle
i
shall
make
a
point
of
fixing
the
responsibility
it
goes
to
the
foundations
of
security
in
all
your
interests
marlow
yes
sir
barthwick
what
sort
of
circumstances
is
this
jones

believe
not
sir
barthwick
very
well
say
nothing
about
it
to
any
one
tell
wheeler
not
to
speak
of
it
and
ask
jones
to
step
up
here
marlow
very
good
sir
marlow
goes
out
his
face
concerned
and
barthwick
stays
his
face
judicial
and
a
little
pleased
as
befits
a
man
conducting
an
inquiry
barthwick
and
hey
son
come
in
barthwick
well
my
dear
you
not
seen
it
i
suppose
barthwick
no
but
what
an
extraordinary
thing
john
marlow
of
course
is
out
of
the
question
i
certain
none
of
the
maids
as
for
cook
barthwick
oh
cook
barthwick
of
course
it
perfectly
detestable
to
me
to
suspect
anybody
barthwick
it
is
not
a
question
of
one
feelings
it
a
question
of
justice
on
principle
barthwick
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
the
charwoman
knew
something
about
it
it
was
laura
who
recommended
her
barthwick
judicially
i
am
going
to
have
jones
up
leave
it
to
me
and
er
remember
that
nobody
is
guilty
until
proved
so
i
shall
be
careful
i
have
no
intention
of
frightening
her
i
shall
give
her
every
chance
i
hear
she
in
poor
circumstances
if
we
are
not
able
to
do
much
for
them
we
are
bound
to
have
the
greatest
sympathy
with
the
poor
jones
comes
in
pleasantly
oh
good
morning
jones
jones
soft
and
even
unemphatic
good
morning

your
husband
he
not
in
work
i
hear
jones
no
sir
of
course

not
earning
anything
just
now

barthwick
and
how
many
children
have
you
jones

very
much
sir

little
silence
barthwick
and
how
old
is
the
eldest
jones
nine
years
old
sir
barthwick
do
they
go
to
school
jones
yes

take
with
them
of

not
always
able
to
give

anything
sometimes
i
have
to
send
them
without
but
my
husband
is
very
good
about
the
children
when
he
in
work
but
when
he
not
in
work
of
course
he
a
very
difficult
man
barthwick
he
drinks
i
suppose
jones
yes
sir
of
course
i
ca
say
he
does
drink
because
he
does
barthwick
and
i
suppose
he
takes
all
your
money
jones
no
sir
he
very
good
about
my
money
except
when
he
not
himself
and
then
of
course
he
treats
me
very
badly
barthwick
now
what
is
he
your
husband
jones
by
profession
sir
of
course
he
a
groom
barthwick
a
groom
how
came
he
to
lose
his
place
jones
he
lost
his
place
a
long
time
ago
sir
and
he
never
had
a
very
long
job
since
and
now
of
course
the
are
against
him
barthwick
when
were
you
married
to
him
jones
jones
eight
years
ago
sir
that
was
in
barthwick
sharply
eight
you
said
the
eldest
child
was
nine
jones
yes
of
course
that
was
why
he
lost
his
place
he
did
treat
me
rightly
and
of
course
his
employer
said
he
could
keep
him
because
of
the
example
barthwick
you
mean
he
ahem
jones
yes
sir
and
of
course
after
he
lost
his
place
he
married
me
barthwick
you
actually
mean
to
say
you
you
were
barthwick
my
dear
barthwick
indignantly
how
disgraceful
barthwick
hurriedly
and
where
are
you
living
now
jones
jones
we
not
got
a
home
sir
of
course
we
been
obliged
to
put
away
most
of
our
things
barthwick
put
your
things
away
you
mean
to
to
er
to
pawn
them
jones
yes
sir
to
put
them
away
we
living
in
merthyr
street
that
is
close
by
here
sir
at
no
we
just
have
the
one
room
barthwick
and
what
do
you
pay
a
week
jones
we
pay
six
shillings
a
week
sir
for
a
furnished
room
barthwick
and
i
suppose
you
behind
in
the
rent
jones
yes
sir
we
a
little
behind
in
the
rent
barthwick
but
you
in
good
work
are
you
jones
well
sir
i
have
a
day
in
stamford
place
thursdays
and
mondays
and
wednesdays
and
fridays
i
come
here
but
of
course
is
a
because
of
yesterday
bank
holiday
barthwick
i
see
four
days
a
week
and
you
get
half
a
crown
a
day
is
that
it
jones
yes
sir
and
my
dinner
but
sometimes
it
only
half
a
day
and
that
eighteen
pence
barthwick
and
when
your
husband
earns
anything
he
spends
it
in
drink
i
suppose
jones
sometimes
he
does
sir
and
sometimes
he
gives
it
to
me
for
the
children
of
course
he
would
work
if
he
could
get
it
sir
but
it
seems
there
are
a
great
many
people
out
of
work
barthwick
ah
yes
we
er
wo
go
into
that
sympathetically
and
how
about
your
work
here
do
you
find
it
hard
jones
oh
no
sir
not
very
hard
sir
except
of
course
when
i
do
get
my
sleep
at
night
barthwick
ah
and
you
help
do
all
the
rooms
and
sometimes
i
suppose
you
go
out
for
cook
jones
yes
sir
barthwick
and
you
been
out
this
morning
jones
yes
sir
of
course
i
had
to
go
to
the
greengrocer
barthwick
exactly
so
your
husband
earns
nothing
and
he
a
bad
character
jones
no
sir
i
do
say
that
sir
i
think
there
a
great
deal
of
good
in
him
though
he
does
treat
me
very
bad
sometimes
and
of
course
i
do
like
to
leave
him
but
i
think
i
ought
to
because
really
i
hardly
know
how
to
stay
with
him
he
often
raises
his
hand
to
me
not
long
ago
he
gave
me
a
blow
here
touches
her
breast
and
i
can
feel
it
now
so
i
think
i
ought
to
leave
him
do
you
sir
barthwick
ah
i
ca
help
you
there
it
a
very
serious
thing
to
leave
your
husband
very
serious
thing
jones
yes
sir
of
course
i
afraid
of
what
he
might
do
to
me
if
i
were
to
leave
him
he
can
be
so
very
violent
barthwick
h
well
that
i
ca
pretend
to
say
anything
about
it
the
bad
principle
i
speaking
of
jones
yes
sir
i
know
nobody
can
help
me
i
know
i
must
decide
for
myself
and
of
course
i
know
that
he
has
a
very
hard
life
and
he
fond
of
the
children
and
its
very
hard
for
him
to
see
them
going
without
food
barthwick
hastily
well

dear

be
any
alternative

effect

in
principle
i
was
thinking
of
that
jack
maliciously
crackers

compelled
to
pass
the
crackers
barthwick
lady
holyrood
told
me

once

do
wish

nothing
barthwick
h
barthwick
servants
have
too
much
license
they
hang
together
so
terribly
you
never
can
tell
what
they
really
thinking
it
as
if
they
were
all
in
a
conspiracy
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
even
with
marlow
you
feel
that
he
never
lets
you
know
what
really
in
his
mind
i
hate
that
secretiveness
it
destroys
all
confidence
i
feel
sometimes
i
should
like
to
shake
him
jack
marlow
a
most
decent
chap
it
simply
beastly
every
one
knowing
your
affairs
barthwick
the
less
you
say
about
that
the
better
barthwick
it
goes
all
through
the
lower
classes
you
can
not
tell
when
they
are
speaking
the
truth
when
i
was
shopping
after
leaving
the
holyroods
one
of
these
unemployed
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
i
suppose
i
only
had
twenty
yards
or
so
to
walk
to
the
carnage
but
he
seemed
to
spring
up
in
the
street
barthwick
ah
you
must
be
very
careful
whom
you
speak
to
in
these
days
barthwick
i
did
answer
him
of
course
but
i
could
see
at
once
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
barthwick
cracking
a
nut
there
one
very
good
rule
look
at
their
eyes
jack
crackers
please
dad
barthwick
passing
the
crackers
if
their
eyes
are
i
sometimes
give
them
sixpence
it
against
my
principles
but
it
most
difficult
to
refuse
if
you
see
that
they
desperate
and
dull
and
as
so
many
of
them
are
it
certain
to
mean
drink
or
crime
or
something
unsatisfactory
barthwick
this
man
had
dreadful
eyes
he
looked
as
if
he
could
commit
a
murder
i
nothing
to
eat
he
said
just
like
that
barthwick
what
was
william
about
he
ought
to
have
been
waiting
jack
raising
his
to
his
nose
is
this
the
dad
barthwick
holding
his
to
his
eye
lowers
it
and
passes
it
before
his
nose
barthwick
i
hate
people
that
ca
speak
the
truth
father
and
son
exchange
a
look
behind
their
port
it
just
as
easy
to
speak
the
truth
as
not
i
always
found
it
easy
enough
it
makes
it
impossible
to
tell
what
is
genuine
one
feels
as
if
one
were
continually
being
taken
in
barthwick
sententiously
the
lower
classes
are
their
own
enemies
if
they
would
only
trust
us
they
would
get
on
so
much
better
barthwick
but
even
then
it
so
often
their
own
fault
look
at
that
jones
this
morning
barthwick
i
only
want
to
do
what
right
in
that
matter
i
had
occasion
to
see
roper
this
afternoon
i
mentioned
it
to
him
coming
in
this
evening
it
all
depends
on
what
the
detective
says
i
had
my
doubts
i
been
thinking
it
over
barthwick
the
woman
impressed
me
most
unfavourably
she
seemed
to
have
no
shame
that
affair
she
was
talking
about
she
and
the
man
when
they
were
young
so
immoral
and
before
you
and
jack
i
could
have
put
her
out
of
the
room
barthwick
oh
i
do
want
to
excuse
them
but
in
looking
at
these
matters
one
must
consider
barthwick
perhaps
you
say
the
man
employer
was
wrong
in
dismissing
him
barthwick
of
course
not
it
not
there
that
i
feel
doubt
what
i
ask
myself
is
jack
port
please
dad
barthwick
circulating
the
decanter
in
religious
imitation
of
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
i
ask
myself
whether
we
are
sufficiently
careful
in
making
inquiries
about
people
before
we
engage
them
especially
as
regards
moral
conduct
jack
pass
please
mother
barthwick
passing
it
my
dear
boy
are
you
drinking
too
much
jack
fills
his
glass
marlow
entering
detective
snow
to
see
you
sir
barthwick
uneasily
ah
say
i
be
with
him
in
a
minute
barthwick
without
turning
let
him
come
in
here
marlow
snow
enters
in
an
overcoat
his
bowler
hat
in
hand
barthwick
oh
good
evening
snow
good
evening
sir
good
evening
i
called
round
to
report
what
i
done
rather
late
i
afraid
another
case
took
me
away
he
takes
the
silver
box
out
o
f
his
pocket
causing
a
sensation
in
the
barthwick
family
this
is
the
identical
article
i
believe
barthwick
certainly
certainly
snow
havin
your
crest
and
cypher
as
you
described
to
me
sir
i
no
hesitation
in
the
matter
barthwick
excellent
will
you
have
a
glass
of
he
glances
at
the
waning
port
er
pours
out
sherry
jack
just
give
mr
snow
this
jack
rises
and
gives
the
glass
to
snow
then
lolling
in
his
chair
regards
him
indolently
snow
drinking
off
wine
and
putting
down
the
glass
after
seeing
you
i
went
round
to
this
woman
lodgings
sir
it
a
low
neighborhood
and
i
thought
it
as
well
to
place
a
constable
below
and
not
without
was
wanted
as
things
turned
out
barthwick
indeed
snow
yes
sir
i
some
trouble
i
asked
her
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
article
she
could
give
me
no
answer
except
to
deny
the
theft
so
i
took
her
into
custody
then
her
husband
came
for
me
so
i
was
obliged
to
take
him
too
for
assault
he
was
very
violent
on
the
way
to
the
station
very
violent
threatened
you
and
your
son
and
altogether
he
was
a
handful
i
can
till
you
barthwick
what
a
ruffian
he
must
be
snow
yes
a
rough
customer
jack
sipping
his
mine
bemused
punch
the
beggar
head
snow
given
to
drink
as
i
understand
sir
barthwick
it
to
be
hoped
he
will
get
a
severe
punishment
snow
the
odd
thing
is
sir
that
he
persists
in
sayin
he
took
the
box
himself
barthwick
took
the
box
himself
he
smiles
what
does
he
think
to
gain
by
that
snow
he
says
the
young
gentleman
was
intoxicated
last
night
jack
stops
the
cracking
of
a
nut
and
looks
at
snow
barthwick
losing
his
smile
has
put
his
down
there
is
a
silence
snow
looking
from
face
to
face
remarks
took
him
into
the
house
and
gave
him
whisky
and
under
the
influence
of
an
empty
stomach
the
man
says
he
took
the
box
barthwick
the
impudent
wretch
barthwick
d
you
mean
that
he
er
intends
to
put
this
forward
snow
that
be
his
line
sir
but
whether
he
endeavouring
to
shield
his
wife
or
whether
he
looks
at
jack
there
something
in
it
will
be
for
the
magistrate
to
say
barthwick
haughtily
something
in
what
i
understand
you
as
if
my
son
would
bring
a
man
like
that
into
the
house
barthwick
from
the
fireplace
with
an
effort
to
be
calm
my
son
can
speak
for
himself
no
doubt
well
jack
what
do
you
say
barthwick
sharply
what
does
he
say
why
of
course
he
says
the
whole
story
stuff
jack
embarrassed
well
of
course
i
of
course
i
do
know
anything
about
it
barthwick
i
should
think
not
indeed
to
snow
the
man
is
an
audacious
ruffian
barthwick
suppressing
jumps
but
in
view
of
my
son
saying
there
nothing
in
this
this
fable
will
it
be
necessary
to
proceed
against
the
man
under
the
circumstances
snow
we
shall
have
to
charge
him
with
the
assault
sir
it
would
be
as
well
for
your
son
to
come
down
to
the
court
there
be
a
remand
no
doubt
the
queer
thing
is
there
was
quite
a
sum
of
money
found
on
him
and
a
crimson
silk
purse
barthwick
starts
jack
rises
and
sits
dozen
again
i
suppose
the
lady
has
missed
her
purse
barthwick
hastily
oh
no
oh
no
jack
no
barthwick
dreamily
no
to
snow
i
been
inquiring
of
the
servants
this
man
does
hang
about
the
house
i
shall
feel
much
safer
if
he
gets
a
good
long
sentence
i
do
think
we
ought
to
be
protected
against
such
ruffians
barthwick
yes
yes
of
course
on
principle
but
in
this
case
we
have
a
number
of
things
to
think
of
to
snow
i
suppose
as
you
say
the
man
must
be
charged
eh
snow
no
question
about
that
sir
barthwick
staring
gloomily
at
jack
this
prosecution
goes
very
much
against
the
grain
with
me
i
have
great
sympathy
with
the
poor
in
my
position
i
bound
to
recognise
the
distress
there
is
amongst
them
the
condition
of
the
people
leaves
much
to
be
desired
d
you
follow
me
i
wish
i
could
see
my
way
to
drop
it
barthwick
sharply
john
it
simply
not
fair
to
other
people
it
putting
property
at
the
mercy
of
any
one
who
likes
to
take
it
barthwick
trying
to
make
signs
to
her
aside
i
not
defending
him
not
at
all
i
trying
to
look
at
the
matter
broadly
barthwick
nonsense
john
there
a
time
for
everything
snow
rather
sardonically
i
might
point
out
sir
that
to
withdraw
the
charge
of
stealing
would
not
make
much
difference
because
the
facts
must
come
out
he
looks
significantly
at
jack
in
reference
to
the
assault
and
as
i
said
that
charge
will
have
to
go
forward
barthwick
hastily
yes
oh
exactly
it
entirely
on
the
woman
account
entirely
a
matter
of
my
own
private
feelings
snow
if
i
were
you
sir
i
should
let
things
take
their
course
it
not
likely
there
be
much
difficulty
these
things
are
very
quick
settled
barthwick
doubtfully
you
think
so
you
think
so
jack
rousing
himself
i
say
what
shall
i
have
to
swear
to
snow
that
best
known
to
yourself
sir
retreating
to
the
door
better
employ
a
solicitor
sir
in
case
anything
should
arise
we
shall
have
the
butler
to
prove
the
loss
of
the
article
you
excuse
me
going
i
rather
pressed
the
case
may
come
on
any
time
after
eleven
good
evening
sir
good
evening
i
shall
have
to
produce
the
box
in
court
so
if
you
excuse
me
sir
i
may
as
well
take
it
with
me
he
takes
the
silver
box
and
leaves
them
with
a
little
bow
barthwick
makes
a
move
to
follow
him
then
dashing
his
hands
beneath
his
coat
tails
speaks
with
desperation
barthwick
i
do
wish
you
leave
me
to
manage
things
myself
you
will
put
your
nose
into
matters
you
know
nothing
of
a
pretty
mess
you
made
of
this
barthwick
coldly
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
talking
about
if
you
ca
stand
up
for
your
rights
i
can
i
no
patience
with
your
principles
it
such
nonsense
barthwick
principles

do

horror
rising

common
decency

drunken
loafer
of
a
husband

the
things
he
says
that
fellow
there
he
waves
his
hand
at

ward
off
a
blow

him
into
the
house
last
night

imagine
such
a
thing
roper
laughs
barthwick

nods
and
barthwick
setting
her

gives
a
slow
look
at
jack
and
sits
down
at
the
table
what
on
earth
to
be
done

ruffian
like
this
jones
will
make
all
the
capital

out
of

purse

took
that
purse
barthwick

when
the
woman
came
here
for
it
this
morning
barthwick
here
she
had
the
impudence
why

told
she
looks
round
from
face
to
face
no
one
answers
hey
there
is
a
pause
barthwick
suddenly
what
to
be
done
roper
roper
quietly
to
jack
i
suppose
you
did
leave
your
in
the
door
jack
sullenly
yes

did
barthwick
good
heavens
what
next
barthwick
i
certain
you
never
let
that
man
into
the
house
jack
it
a
wild
invention
i
sure
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
roper
roper
very
suddenly
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
jack
promptly
on
the
sofa
there
hesitating
that
is
i
barthwick
on
the
sofa
d
you
mean
to
say
you
did
go
to
bed
sullenly
no
barthwick
if
you
do
remember
anything
how
can
you
remember
that
jack
because
i
woke
up
there
in
the
morning
barthwick
oh
jack
barthwick
good
gracious
jack
and
jones
saw
me
i
wish

bait
me
so
roper
do
you
remember
giving
any
one
a
drink

by
jove
i
do
seem
to
remember
a
fellow
with
a
fellow
with
he
looks
at
roper
i
say
d
you
want
me
roper
quick
as
lightning
with
a
dirty
face
jack
with
illumination
i
do
i
distinctly
remember
his
barthwick
moves
abruptly
barthwick
looks
at
roper
angrily
and
touches
her
son
arm
barthwick
you
do
remember
it
ridiculous
i
believe
the
man
was
ever
here
at
all
barthwick
you
must
speak
the
truth
if
it
is
the
truth
but
if
you
do
remember
such
a
dirty
business
i
shall
wash
my
hands
of
you
altogether

glaring
at
them

i
do

what
you
do
want
barthwick
we
want
you
to
speak
the
truth
and
say
you
never
let
this
low
man
into
the
house
barthwick
of
course
if
you
think
that
you
really
gave
this
man
whisky
in
that
disgraceful
way
and
let
him
see
what
you
been
doing
and
were
in
such
a
disgusting
condition
that
you
remember
a
word
of
it
roper
quick
i
no
memory
myself
never
had
barthwick
desperately
i
do
know
what
you
to
say
roper
to
jack
say
nothing
at
all
do
put
yourself
in
a
false
position
the
man
stole
the
things
or
the
woman
stole
the
things
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
were
asleep
on
the
sofa
barthwick
your
leaving
the
in
the
door
was
quite
bad
enough
there
no
need
to
mention
anything
else
touching
his
forehead
softly
my
dear
how
hot
your
head
is
jack
but
i
want
to
know
what
i
to
do
passionately
i
be
badgered
like
this
barthwick
recoils
from
him
roper
very
quickly
you
forget
all
about
it
you
were
asleep
jack
must
i
go
down
to
the
court
roper
shaking
his
head
no
barthwick
in
a
relieved
voice
is
that
so
roper
yes
barthwick
but
you
go
roper
roper
yes
jack
with
wan
cheerfulness
thanks
awfully
so
long
as
i
do
have
to
go
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
head
i
think
if
you
excuse
me
i
had
a
most
beastly
day
he
looks
from
his
father
to
his
mother
barthwick
turning
quickly
goodnight
my
boy
jack
mother
he
goes
out
barthwick
heaves
a
sigh
there
is
a
silence
barthwick
he
gets
off
too
easily
but
for
my
money
that
woman
would
have
prosecuted
him
roper
you
find
money
useful
barthwick
i
my
doubts
whether
we
ought
to
hide
the
truth
roper
there
be
a
remand
barthwick
what
d
you
mean
he
have
to
appear
on
the
remand
roper
yes
barthwick
h
i
thought
you
be
able
to
look
here
roper
you
must
keep
that
purse
out
of
the
papers
roper
fixes
his
little
eyes
on
him
and
nods
barthwick
roper
do
you
think
the
magistrate
ought
to
be
told
what
sort
of
people
these
jones
are
i
mean
about
their
immorality
before
they
were
married
i
do
know
if
john
told
you
roper
afraid
it
not
material
barthwick
not
material
roper
purely
private
life
may
have
happened
to
the
magistrate
barthwick
with
a
movement
as
if
to
shift
a
burden
then
take
the
thing
into
your
hands
roper
if
the
gods
are
kind
he
holds
his
hand
out
barthwick
shaking
it
dubiously
kind
eh
what
you
going
roper
yes
i
another
case
something
like
yours
most
unexpected
he
bows
to
barthwick
and
goes
out
followed
by
barthwick
talking
to
the
last
barthwick
at
the
table
bursts
into
smothered
sobs
barthwick
returns
barthwick
to
himself
there
be
a
scandal
barthwick
disguising
her
grief
at
once
i
simply
imagine
what
roper
means
by
making
a
joke
of
a
thing
like
that
barthwick
staring
strangely
you
you
ca
imagine
anything
you
no
more
imagination
than
a
fly
barthwick
angrily
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
i
have
no
imagination
barthwick
flustered
i
i
upset
from
beginning
to
end
the
whole
thing
has
been
utterly
against
my
principles
barthwick
rubbish
you
have
any
your
principles
are
nothing
in
the
world
but
sheer
fright
barthwick
walking
to
the
window
i
never
been
frightened
in
my
life
you
heard
what
roper
said
it
enough
to
upset
one
when
a
thing
like
this
happens
everything
one
says
and
does
seems
to
turn
in
one
mouth
it
it
uncanny
it
not
the
sort
of
thing
i
been
accustomed
to
as
though
stifling
he
throws
the
window
open
the
faint
sobbing
of
a
child
comes
in
what
that
they
listen
barthwick
sharply
i
ca
stand
that
crying
i
must
send
marlow
to
stop
it
my
nerves
are
all
on
edge
she
rings
the
bell
barthwick
i
shut
the
window
you
hear
nothing
he
shuts
the
window
there
is
silence
barthwick
sharply
that
no
good
it
on
my
nerves
nothing
upsets
me
like
a
child
crying
marlow
comes
in
what
that
noise
of
crying
marlow
it
sounds
like
a
child
barthwick
it
is
a
child
i
can
see
it
against
the
railings
marlow
opening
the
window
and
looking
out
quietly
it
jones
little
boy
he
came
here
after
his
mother
barthwick
moving
quickly
to
the
window
poor
little
chap
john
we
ought
to
go
on
with
this
barthwick
sitting
heavily
in
a
chair
ah
but
it
out
of
our
hands
barthwick
turns
her
back
to
the
window
there
is
an
expression
of
distress
on
hey
face
she
stands
motionless
compressing
her
lips
the
crying
begins
again
barthwick
coveys
his
ears
with
his
hands
and
marlow
shuts
the
window
the
crying
ceases
the
curtain
falls
act
iii
eight
days
have

that
i
did
take
the
box
magistrate
yes
but
did
you
know
that
it
was
taken
jones
no
your
worship
and
of
course
to
what
my
husband
says
your
worship
i
ca
speak
of
my
own
knowledge
of
course
i
know
that
he
came
home
very
late
on
the
monday
night
it
was
past
one
when
he
came
in
and
he
was
not
himself
at
all
magistrate
had
he
been
drinking
jones
yes
your
worship
magistrate
and
was
he
drunk
jones
yes
your
worship
he
was
almost
quite
drunk
magistrate
and
did
he
say
anything
to
you
jones
no
your
worship
only
to
call
me
names
and
of
course
in
the
morning
when
i
got
up
and
went
to
work
he
was
asleep
and
i
do
know
anything
more
about
it
until
i
came
home
again
except
that
barthwick
that
my
employer
your
worship
told
me
the
box
was
missing
magistrate
yes
yes
jones
but
of
course
when
i
was
shaking
out
my
husband
coat
the
fell
out
and
all
the
cigarettes
were
scattered
on
the
bed
magistrate
you
say
all
the
cigarettes
were
scattered
on
the
bed
to
snow
did
you
see
the
cigarettes
scattered
on
the
bed
snow
no
your
worship
i
did
not
magistrate
you
see
he
says
he
did
see
them
jones
well
they
were
there
for
all
that
snow
i
ca
say
your
worship
that
i
had
the
opportunity
of
going
round
the
room
i
had
all
my
work
cut
out
with
the
male
prisoner
magistrate
to
mrs
jones
well
what
more
have
you
to
say
jones
of
course
when
i
saw
the
box
your
worship
i
was
dreadfully
upset
and
i
could
think
why
he
had
done
such
a
thing
when
the
officer
came
we
were
having
words
about
it
because
it
is
ruin
to
me
your
worship
in
my
profession
and
i
have
three
little
children
dependent
on
me
magistrate
protruding
his
neck
yes
yes
but
what
did
he
say
to
you
jones
i
asked
him
whatever
came
over
him
to
do
such
a
thing
and
he
said
it
was
the
drink
he
said
he
had
had
too
much
to
drink
and
something
came
over
him
and
of
course
your
worship
he
had
had
very
little
to
eat
all
day
and
the
drink
does
go
to
the
head
when
you
have
not
had
enough
to
eat
your
worship
may
not
know
but
it
is
the
truth
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
all
through
his
married
life
i
have
never
known
him
to
do
such
a
thing
before
though
we
have
passed
through
great
hardships
and
speaking
with
soft
emphasis
i
am
quite
sure
he
would
not
have
done
it
if
he
had
been
himself
at
the
time
magistrate
yes
yes
but
do
you
know
that
that
is
no
excuse
jones
yes
your
worship
i
know
that
it
is
no
excuse
the
magistrate
leans
over
and
parleys
with
his
clerk
jack
leaning
over
from
his
seat
behind
i
say
dad
barthwick
tsst
sheltering
his
mouth
he
speaks
to
roper
roper
you
had
better
get
up
now
and
say
that
considering
the
circumstances
and
the
poverty
of
the
prisoners
we
have
no
wish
to
proceed
any
further
and
if
the
magistrate
would
deal
with
the
case
as
one
of
disorder
only
on
the
part
of
bald
constable
hssshh
roper
shakes
his
head
magistrate
now
supposing
what
you
say
and
what
your
husband
says
is
true
what
i
have
to
consider
is
how
did
he
obtain
access
to
this
house
and
were
you
in
any
way
a
party
to
his
obtaining
access
you
are
the
charwoman
employed
at
the
house
jones
yes
your
worship
and
of
course
if
i
had
let
him
into
the
house
it
would
have
been
very
wrong
of
me
and
i
have
never
done
such

bag
in
your
barthwick
jumps
roper
i
submit
to
your
worship
that
these
questions
are
hardly
to
the
point
the
prisoner
having
admitted
that
he
himself
does
not
remember
anything
there
is
a
smile
on
the
face
of
justice
it
is
a
case
of
the
blind
leading
the
blind
jones
violently
i
done
no
more
than
wot
he
i
a
poor
man
i
got
no
money
an
no
friends
he
a
toff
he
can
do
wot
i
ca
magistrate
now
now
all
this
wo
help
you
you
must
be
quiet
you
say
you
took
this
box
now
what
made
you
take
it
were
you
pressed
for
money
jones
i
always
pressed
for
money
magistrate
was
that
the
reason
you
took
it
jones
no
magistrate
to
snow
was
anything
found
on
him
snow
yes
your
worship
there
was
six
pounds
twelve
found
on

and
this
purse
the
red
silk
purse
is
handed
to
the
magistrate
barthwick
rises
his
seat
but
hastily
sits
down
again
magistrate
staring
at
the
purse
yes
yes
let
me
see
there
is
a
silence
no
no
i
nothing
before
me
as
to
the
purse
how
did
you
come
by
all
that
money
jones
after
a
long
pause
suddenly
i
declines
to
say
magistrate
but
if
you
had
all
that
money
what
made
you
take
this
box
jones
i
took
it
out
of
spite
magistrate
hissing
with
protruded
neck
you
took
it
out
of
spite
well
now
that
something
but
do
you
imagine
you
can
go
about
the
town
taking
things
out
of
spite
jones
if
you
had
my
life
if
you
been
out
of
work
magistrate
yes
yes
i
know
because
you
out
of
work
you
think
it
an
excuse
for
everything
jones
pointing
at
jack
you
ask
wot
made
take
the
roper
quietly
does
your
worship
require
this
witness
in
the
box
any
longer
magistrate
ironically
i
think
not
he
is
hardly
profitable
jack
leaves
the
and
hanging
his
head
resumes
his
seat
jones
you
ask
wot
made
take
the
lady
but
the
bald
constable
catches
him
by
the
sleeve
bald
constable
sssh
magistrate
emphatically
now
listen
to
me
i
nothing
to
do
with
what
he
may
or
may
not
have
taken
why
did
you
resist
the
police
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
jones
it
war
their
duty
to
take
my
wife
a
respectable
woman
that
done
nothing
magistrate
but
i
say
it
was
what
made
you
strike
the
officer
a
blow
jones
any
man
would
a
struck
a
blow
i
strike
again
i
would
magistrate
you
are
not
making
your
case
any
better
by
violence
how
do
you
suppose
we
could
get
on
if
everybody
behaved
like
you
jones
leaning
forward
earnestly
well
wot
about
to
make
up
to
for

i
lost
my
work
and
i
had
to
find
another
room
owing
to
the
scandal
magistrate
yes
yes
i
know
but
if
he
had
acted
like
this
nobody
would
have
suffered
jones
glaring
round
at
jack
i
done
no
worse
than
wot
wot
i
want
to
know
is
wot
goin
to
be
done
to
the
bald
constable
again
says
hssh
roper
barthwick
wishes
it
known
your
worship
that
considering
the
poverty
of
the
prisoners
he
does
not
press
the
charge
as
to

box
perhaps
your
worship
would
deal
with
the
case
as
one
of
disorder
jones
i
do
want
it
smothered
up
i
want
it

the
woman
in
a
kindly
voice
he
addresses
jones
who
stands
unmoving

her
hands
crossed
on
the
rail
it
is
very
unfortunate
for
you
that
this
man

consequences
to
him
but
the
consequences
to
