the
séance
on
a
march
evening
at
eight
o
clock
backhouse
the
rising
star
in
the
psychic
ushered
into
the
study
at
prolands
the
hampstead
residence
of
montague
faull
the
room
was
illuminated
only
by
the
light
of
a
blazing
fire
the
host
eying
him
with
indolent
curiosity
got
up
and
the
usual
conventional
greetings
were
exchanged
having
indicated
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
to
his
guest
the
south
american
merchant
sank
back
again
into
his
own
the
electric
light
was
switched
on
faull
s
prominent
features
skin
and
general
air
of
bored
impassiveness
did
not
seem
greatly
to
impress
the
medium
who
was
accustomed
to
regard
men
from
a
special
angle
backhouse
on
the
contrary
was
a
novelty
to
the
merchant
as
he
tranquilly
studied
him
through
half
closed
lids
and
the
smoke
of
a
cigar
he
wondered
how
this
little
thickset
person
with
the
pointed
beard
contrived
to
remain
so
fresh
and
sane
in
appearance
in
view
of
the
morbid
nature
of
his
occupation
do
you
smoke
drawled
faull
by
way
of
starting
the
conversation
no
then
will
you
take
a
drink
not
at
present
i
thank
a
pause
everything
is
satisfactory
the
materialisation
will
take
place
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
s
good
for
i
would
not
like
my
guests
to
be
disappointed
i
have
your
check
written
out
in
my
afterward
will
do
quite
nine
o
clock
was
the
time
specified
i
believe
i
fancy
the
conversation
continued
to
flag
faull
sprawled
in
his
chair
and
remained
apathetic
would
you
care
to
hear
what
arrangements
i
have
made
i
am
unaware
that
any
are
necessary
beyond
chairs
for
your
i
mean
the
decoration
of
the
siance
room
the
music
and
so
backhouse
stared
at
his
host
but
this
is
not
a
theatrical
that
s
correct
perhaps
i
ought
to
explain
there
will
be
ladies
present
and
ladies
you
know
are
aesthetically
in
that
case
i
have
no
objection
i
only
hope
they
will
enjoy
the
performance
to
the
he
spoke
rather
dryly
well
that
s
all
right
then
said
faull
flicking
his
cigar
into
the
fire
he
got
up
and
helped
himself
to
whisky
will
you
come
and
see
the
room
thank
you
no
i
prefer
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
till
the
time
then
let
s
go
to
see
my
sister
jameson
who
is
in
the
drawing
room
she
sometimes
does
me
the
kindness
to
act
as
my
hostess
as
i
am
i
will
be
delighted
said
backhouse
coldly
they
found
the
lady
alone
sitting
by
the
open
pianoforte
in
a
pensive
attitude
she
had
been
playing
scriabin
and
was
overcome
the
medium
took
in
her
small
tight
patrician
features
and
hands
and
wondered
how
faull
came
by
such
a
sister
she
received
him
bravely
with
just
a
shade
of
quiet
emotion
he
was
used
to
such
receptions
at
the
hands
of
the
sex
and
knew
well
how
to
respond
to
them
what
amazes
me
she
half
whispered
after
ten
minutes
of
graceful
hollow
conversation
is
if
you
must
know
it
not
so
much
the
manifestation
that
will
surely
be
your
assurance
that
it
will
take
place
tell
me
the
grounds
of
your
i
dream
with
open
eyes
he
answered
looking
around
at
the
door
and
others
see
my
dreams
that
is
but
that
s
beautiful
responded
jameson
she
smiled
rather
absently
for
the
first
guest
had
just
entered
it
was
the
celebrated
for
his
shrewd
judicial
humour
which
however
he
had
the
good
sense
not
to
attempt
to
carry
into
private
life
although
well
on
the
wrong
side
of
seventy
his
eyes
were
still
disconcertingly
bright
with
the
selective
skill
of
an
old
man
he
immediately
settled
himself
in
the
most
comfortable
of
many
comfortable
chairs
so
we
are
to
see
wonders
tonight
fresh
material
for
your
autobiography
remarked
faull
ah
you
should
not
have
mentioned
my
unfortunate
book
an
old
public
servant
is
merely
amusing
himself
in
his
retirement
backhouse
you
have
no
cause
for
have
studied
in
the
school
of
i
am
not
alarmed
there
can
be
no
possible
objection
to
your
publishing
whatever
you
you
are
most
kind
said
the
old
man
with
a
cunning
smile
trent
is
not
coming
tonight
remarked
jameson
throwing
a
curious
little
glance
at
her
brother
i
never
thought
he
would
it
s
not
in
his
mrs
trent
you
must
understand
she
went
on
addressing
the
magistrate
has
placed
us
all
under
a
debt
of
gratitude
she
has
decorated
the
old
lounge
hall
upstairs
most
beautifully
and
has
secured
the
services
of
the
sweetest
little
but
this
is
roman
backhouse
thinks
the
spirits
should
be
treated
with
more
deference
laughed
faull
surely
poetic
environment
pardon
me
i
am
a
simple
man
and
always
prefer
to
reduce
things
to
elemental
simplicity
i
raise
no
opposition
but
i
express
my
opinion
nature
is
one
thing
and
art
is
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
don
t
agree
with
you
said
the
an
occasion
like
this
ought
to
be
simple
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
you
will
forgive
my
bluntness
we
shall
sit
in
full
light
replied
backhouse
and
every
opportunity
will
be
given
to
all
to
inspect
the
room
i
shall
also
ask
you
to
submit
me
to
a
personal
a
rather
embarrassed
silence
followed
it
was
broken
by
the
arrival
of
two
more
guests
who
entered
together
these
were
prior
the
prosperous
city
coffee
importer
and
lang
the
stockjobber
well
known
in
his
own
circle
as
an
amateur
prestidigitator
backhouse
was
slightly
acquainted
with
the
latter
prior
perfuming
the
room
with
the
faint
odour
of
wine
and
tobacco
smoke
tried
to
introduce
an
atmosphere
of
joviality
into
the
proceedings
finding
that
no
one
seconded
his
efforts
however
he
shortly
subsided
and
fell
to
examining
the
water
colours
on
the
walls
lang
tall
thin
and
growing
bald
said
little
but
stared
at
backhouse
a
good
deal
coffee
liqueurs
and
cigarettes
were
now
brought
in
everyone
partook
except
lang
and
the
medium
at
the
same
moment
professor
halbart
was
announced
he
was
the
eminent
psychologist
the
author
and
lecturer
on
crime
insanity
genius
and
so
forth
considered
in
their
mental
aspects
his
presence
at
such
a
gathering
somewhat
mystified
the
other
guests
but
all
felt
as
if
the
object
of
their
meeting
had
immediately
acquired
additional
solemnity
he
was
small
and
mild
in
manner
but
was
probably
the
most
of
all
that
mixed
company
completely
ignoring
the
medium
he
at
once
sat
down
beside
with
whom
he
began
to
exchange
remarks
at
a
few
minutes
past
the
appointed
hour
trent
entered
unannounced
she
was
a
woman
of
about
she
had
a
white
demure
saintlike
face
smooth
black
hair
and
lips
so
crimson
and
full
that
they
seemed
to
be
bursting
with
blood
her
tall
graceful
body
was
most
expensively
attired
kisses
were
exchanged
between
her
and
jameson
she
bowed
to
the
rest
of
the
assembly
and
stole
a
half
glance
and
a
smile
at
faull
the
latter
gave
her
a
queer
look
and
backhouse
who
lost
nothing
saw
the
concealed
barbarian
in
the
complacent
gleam
of
his
eye
she
refused
the
refreshment
that
was
offered
her
and
faull
proposed
that
as
everyone
had
now
arrived
they
should
adjourn
to
the
lounge
hall
trent
held
up
a
slender
palm
did
you
or
did
you
not
give
me
carte
blanche
montague
of
course
i
did
said
faull
laughing
but
what
s
the
matter
perhaps
i
have
been
rather
presumptuous
i
don
t
know
i
have
invited
a
couple
of
friends
to
join
us
no
no
one
knows
them
the
two
most
extraordinary
individuals
you
ever
saw
and
mediums
i
am
it
sounds
very
mysterious
who
are
these
conspirators
at
least
tell
us
their
names
you
provoking
girl
put
in
jameson
one
rejoices
in
the
name
of
maskull
and
the
other
in
that
of
nightspore
that
s
nearly
all
that
i
know
about
them
so
don
t
overwhelm
me
with
any
more
but
where
did
you
pick
them
up
you
must
have
picked
them
up
but
this
is
a
have
i
sinned
against
convention
i
swear
i
will
tell
you
not
another
word
about
them
they
will
be
here
directly
and
then
i
will
deliver
them
to
your
tender
i
don
t
know
them
said
faull
and
nobody
else
seems
to
but
of
course
we
will
all
be
very
pleased
to
have
them
shall
we
wait
or
what
i
said
nine
and
it
s
past
that
now
it
s
quite
possible
they
may
not
turn
up
after
all
anyway
don
t
i
would
prefer
to
start
at
once
said
backhouse
the
lounge
a
lofty
room
forty
feet
long
by
twenty
wide
had
been
divided
for
the
occasion
into
two
equal
parts
by
a
heavy
brocade
curtain
drawn
across
the
middle
the
far
end
was
thus
concealed
the
nearer
half
had
been
converted
into
an
auditorium
by
a
crescent
of
armchairs
there
was
no
other
furniture
a
large
fire
was
burning
halfway
along
the
wall
between
the
chairbacks
and
the
door
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
by
electric
bracket
lamps
a
sumptuous
carpet
covered
the
floor
having
settled
his
guests
in
their
seats
faull
stepped
up
to
the
curtain
and
flung
it
aside
a
replica
or
nearly
so
of
the
drury
lane
presentation
of
the
temple
scene
in
the
magic
flute
was
then
exposed
to
view
the
gloomy
massive
architecture
of
the
interior
the
glowing
sky
above
it
in
the
background
and
silhouetted
against
the
latter
the
gigantic
seated
statue
of
the
pharaoh
a
fantastically
carved
wooden
couch
lay
before
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
near
the
curtain
obliquely
placed
to
the
auditorium
was
a
plain
oak
armchair
for
the
use
of
the
medium
many
of
those
present
felt
privately
that
the
setting
was
quite
inappropriate
to
the
occasion
and
savoured
rather
unpleasantly
of
ostentation
backhouse
in
particular
seemed
put
out
the
usual
compliments
however
were
showered
on
trent
as
the
deviser
of
so
remarkable
a
theatre
faull
invited
his
friends
to
step
forward
and
examine
the
apartment
as
minutely
as
they
might
desire
prior
and
lang
were
the
only
ones
to
accept
the
former
wandered
about
among
the
pasteboard
scenery
whistling
to
himself
and
occasionally
tapping
a
part
of
it
with
his
knuckles
lang
who
was
in
his
element
ignored
the
rest
of
his
party
and
commenced
a
patient
systematic
search
on
his
own
account
for
secret
apparatus
faull
and
trent
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
temple
talking
together
in
low
tones
while
jameson
pretending
to
hold
backhouse
in
conversation
watched
them
as
only
a
deeply
interested
woman
knows
how
to
watch
lang
to
his
own
disgust
having
failed
to
find
anything
of
a
suspicious
nature
the
medium
now
requested
that
his
own
clothing
should
be
searched
all
these
precautions
are
quite
needless
and
beside
the
matter
in
hand
as
you
will
immediately
see
for
yourselves
my
reputation
demands
however
that
other
people
who
are
not
present
would
not
be
able
to
say
afterward
that
trickery
has
been
resorted
to
lang
again
fell
the
ungrateful
task
of
investigating
pockets
and
sleeves
within
a
few
minutes
he
expressed
himself
satisfied
that
nothing
mechanical
was
in
backhouse
s
possession
the
guests
reseated
themselves
faull
ordered
two
more
chairs
to
be
brought
for
trent
s
friends
who
however
had
not
yet
arrived
he
then
pressed
an
electric
bell
and
took
his
own
seat
the
signal
was
for
the
hidden
orchestra
to
begin
playing
a
murmur
of
surprise
passed
through
the
audience
as
without
previous
warning
the
beautiful
and
solemn
strains
of
mozart
s
temple
music
pulsated
through
the
air
the
expectation
of
everyone
was
raised
while
beneath
her
pallor
and
composure
it
could
be
seen
that
trent
was
deeply
moved
it
was
evident
that
aesthetically
she
was
by
far
the
most
important
person
present
faull
watched
her
with
his
face
sunk
on
his
chest
sprawling
as
usual
backhouse
stood
up
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
began
speaking
the
music
instantly
sank
to
pianissimo
and
remained
so
for
as
long
as
he
was
on
his
legs
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
are
about
to
witness
a
materialisation
that
means
you
will
see
something
appear
in
space
that
was
not
previously
there
at
first
it
will
appear
as
a
vaporous
form
but
finally
it
will
be
a
solid
body
which
anyone
present
may
feel
and
for
example
shake
hands
with
for
this
body
will
be
in
the
human
shape
it
will
be
a
real
man
or
i
can
t
a
man
or
woman
without
known
antecedents
if
however
you
demand
from
me
an
explanation
of
the
origin
of
this
materialised
it
comes
from
whence
the
atoms
and
molecules
composing
its
tissues
are
am
unable
to
satisfy
you
i
am
about
to
produce
the
phenomenon
if
anyone
can
explain
it
to
me
afterward
i
shall
be
very
grateful
that
is
all
i
have
to
he
resumed
his
seat
half
turning
his
back
on
the
assembly
and
paused
for
a
moment
before
beginning
his
task
it
was
precisely
at
this
minute
that
the
manservant
opened
the
door
and
announced
in
a
subdued
but
distinct
voice
mr
maskull
everyone
turned
round
faull
rose
to
welcome
the
late
arrivals
backhouse
also
stood
up
and
stared
hard
at
them
the
two
strangers
remained
standing
by
the
door
which
was
closed
quietly
behind
them
they
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
mild
sensation
caused
by
their
appearance
to
subside
before
advancing
into
the
room
maskull
was
a
kind
of
giant
but
of
broader
and
more
robust
physique
than
most
giants
he
wore
a
full
beard
his
features
were
thick
and
heavy
coarsely
modelled
like
those
of
a
wooden
carving
but
his
eyes
small
and
black
sparkled
with
the
fires
of
intelligence
and
audacity
his
hair
was
short
black
and
bristling
nightspore
was
of
middle
height
but
so
that
he
appeared
to
be
trained
out
of
all
human
frailties
and
susceptibilities
his
hairless
face
seemed
consumed
by
an
intense
spiritual
hunger
and
his
eyes
were
wild
and
distant
both
men
were
dressed
in
tweeds
before
any
words
were
spoken
a
loud
and
terrible
crash
of
falling
masonry
caused
the
assembled
party
to
start
up
from
their
chairs
in
consternation
it
sounded
as
if
the
entire
upper
part
of
the
building
had
collapsed
faull
sprang
to
the
door
and
called
to
the
servant
to
say
what
was
happening
the
man
had
to
be
questioned
twice
before
he
gathered
what
was
required
of
him
he
said
he
had
heard
nothing
in
obedience
to
his
master
s
order
he
went
upstairs
nothing
however
was
amiss
there
neither
had
the
maids
heard
anything
in
the
meantime
backhouse
who
almost
alone
of
those
assembled
had
preserved
his
sangfroid
went
straight
up
to
nightspore
who
stood
gnawing
his
nails
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
sir
it
was
supernatural
said
nightspore
in
a
harsh
muffled
voice
turning
away
from
his
questioner
i
guessed
so
it
is
a
familiar
phenomenon
but
i
have
never
heard
it
so
he
then
went
among
the
guests
reassuring
them
by
degrees
they
settled
down
but
it
was
observable
that
their
former
easy
and
interest
in
the
proceedings
was
now
changed
to
strained
watchfulness
maskull
and
nightspore
took
the
places
allotted
to
them
trent
kept
stealing
uneasy
glances
at
them
throughout
the
entire
incident
mozart
s
hymn
continued
to
be
played
the
orchestra
also
had
heard
nothing
backhouse
now
entered
on
his
task
it
was
one
that
began
to
be
familiar
to
him
and
he
had
no
anxiety
about
the
result
it
was
not
possible
to
effect
the
materialisation
by
mere
concentration
of
will
or
the
exercise
of
any
faculty
otherwise
many
people
could
have
done
what
he
had
engaged
himself
to
do
his
nature
was
dividing
wall
between
himself
and
the
spiritual
world
was
broken
in
many
places
through
the
gaps
in
his
mind
the
inhabitants
of
the
invisible
when
he
summoned
them
passed
for
a
moment
timidly
and
awfully
into
the
solid
coloured
universe
he
could
not
say
how
it
was
brought
about
the
experience
was
a
rough
one
for
the
body
and
many
such
struggles
would
lead
to
insanity
and
early
death
that
is
why
backhouse
was
stern
and
abrupt
in
his
manner
the
coarse
clumsy
suspicion
of
some
of
the
witnesses
the
frivolous
aestheticism
of
others
were
equally
obnoxious
to
his
grim
bursting
heart
but
he
was
obliged
to
live
and
to
pay
his
way
must
put
up
with
these
impertinences
he
sat
down
facing
the
wooden
couch
his
eyes
remained
open
but
seemed
to
look
inward
his
cheeks
paled
and
he
became
noticeably
thinner
the
spectators
almost
forgot
to
breathe
the
more
sensitive
among
them
began
to
feel
or
imagine
strange
presences
all
around
them
maskull
s
eyes
glittered
with
anticipation
and
his
brows
went
up
and
down
but
nightspore
appeared
bored
after
a
long
ten
minutes
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
was
seen
to
become
slightly
blurred
as
though
an
intervening
mist
were
rising
from
the
ground
this
slowly
developed
into
a
visible
cloud
coiling
hither
and
thither
and
constantly
changing
shape
the
professor
half
rose
and
held
his
glasses
with
one
hand
further
forward
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
by
slow
stages
the
cloud
acquired
the
dimensions
and
approximate
outline
of
an
adult
human
body
although
all
was
still
vague
and
blurred
it
hovered
lightly
in
the
air
a
foot
or
so
above
the
couch
backhouse
looked
haggard
and
ghastly
jameson
quietly
fainted
in
her
chair
but
she
was
unnoticed
and
presently
revived
the
apparition
now
settled
down
upon
the
couch
and
at
the
moment
of
doing
so
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
dark
solid
and
manlike
many
of
the
guests
were
as
pale
as
the
medium
himself
but
faull
preserved
his
stoical
apathy
and
glanced
once
or
twice
at
trent
she
was
staring
straight
at
the
couch
and
was
twisting
a
little
lace
handkerchief
through
the
different
fingers
of
her
hand
the
music
went
on
playing
the
figure
was
by
this
time
unmistakably
that
of
a
man
lying
down
the
face
focused
itself
into
distinctness
the
body
was
draped
in
a
sort
of
shroud
but
the
features
were
those
of
a
young
man
one
smooth
hand
fell
over
nearly
touching
the
floor
white
and
motionless
the
weaker
spirits
of
the
company
stared
at
the
vision
in
sick
horror
the
rest
were
grave
and
perplexed
the
seeming
man
was
dead
but
somehow
it
did
not
appear
like
a
death
succeeding
life
but
like
a
death
preliminary
to
life
all
felt
that
he
might
sit
up
at
any
minute
stop
that
music
muttered
backhouse
tottering
from
his
chair
and
facing
the
party
faull
touched
the
bell
a
few
more
bars
sounded
and
then
total
silence
ensued
anyone
who
wants
to
may
approach
the
couch
said
backhouse
with
difficulty
lang
at
once
advanced
and
stared
awestruck
at
the
supernatural
youth
you
are
at
liberty
to
touch
said
the
medium
but
lang
did
not
venture
to
nor
did
any
of
the
others
who
one
by
one
stole
up
to
the
it
came
to
faull
s
turn
he
looked
straight
at
trent
who
seemed
frightened
and
disgusted
at
the
spectacle
before
her
and
then
not
only
touched
the
apparition
but
suddenly
grasped
the
drooping
hand
in
his
own
and
gave
it
a
powerful
squeeze
trent
gave
a
low
scream
the
ghostly
visitor
opened
his
eyes
looked
at
faull
strangely
and
sat
up
on
the
couch
a
cryptic
smile
started
playing
over
his
mouth
faull
looked
at
his
hand
a
feeling
of
intense
pleasure
passed
through
his
body
maskull
caught
jameson
in
his
arms
she
was
attacked
by
another
spell
of
faintness
trent
ran
forward
and
led
her
out
of
the
room
neither
of
them
returned
the
phantom
body
now
stood
upright
looking
about
him
still
with
his
peculiar
smile
prior
suddenly
felt
sick
and
went
out
the
other
men
more
or
less
hung
together
for
the
sake
of
human
society
but
nightspore
paced
up
and
down
like
a
man
weary
and
impatient
while
maskull
attempted
to
interrogate
the
youth
the
apparition
watched
him
with
a
baffling
expression
but
did
not
answer
backhouse
was
sitting
apart
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
door
was
burst
open
violently
and
a
stranger
unannounced
half
leaped
half
strode
a
few
yards
into
the
room
and
then
stopped
none
of
faull
s
friends
had
ever
seen
him
before
he
was
a
thick
shortish
man
with
surprising
muscular
development
and
a
head
far
too
large
in
proportion
to
his
body
his
beardless
yellow
face
indicated
as
a
first
impression
a
mixture
of
sagacity
brutality
and
humour
gentlemen
he
called
out
loudly
his
voice
was
piercing
and
oddly
disagreeable
to
the
ear
so
we
have
a
little
visitor
nightspore
turned
his
back
but
everyone
else
stared
at
the
intruder
in
astonishment
he
took
another
few
steps
forward
which
brought
him
to
the
edge
of
the
theatre
may
i
ask
sir
how
i
come
to
have
the
honour
of
being
your
host
asked
faull
sullenly
he
thought
that
the
evening
was
not
proceeding
as
smoothly
as
he
had
anticipated
the
newcomer
looked
at
him
for
a
second
and
then
broke
into
a
great
roaring
guffaw
he
thumped
faull
on
the
back
the
play
was
rather
rough
for
the
victim
was
sent
staggering
against
the
wall
before
he
could
recover
his
balance
good
evening
my
host
and
good
evening
to
you
too
my
lad
he
went
on
addressing
the
supernatural
youth
who
was
now
beginning
to
wander
about
the
room
in
apparent
unconsciousness
of
his
surroundings
i
have
seen
someone
very
like
you
before
i
there
was
no
response
the
intruder
thrust
his
head
almost
up
to
the
phantom
s
face
you
have
no
right
here
as
you
the
shape
looked
back
at
him
with
a
smile
full
of
significance
which
however
no
one
could
understand
be
careful
what
you
are
doing
said
backhouse
quickly
what
s
the
matter
spirit
usher
i
don
t
know
who
you
are
but
if
you
use
physical
violence
toward
that
as
you
seem
inclined
to
do
the
consequences
may
prove
very
and
without
pleasure
our
evening
would
be
spoiled
wouldn
t
it
my
little
mercenary
friend
humour
vanished
from
his
face
like
sunlight
from
a
landscape
leaving
it
hard
and
rocky
before
anyone
realised
what
he
was
doing
he
encircled
the
soft
white
neck
of
the
materialised
shape
with
his
hairy
hands
and
with
a
double
turn
twisted
it
completely
round
a
faint
unearthly
shriek
sounded
and
the
body
fell
in
a
heap
to
the
floor
its
face
was
uppermost
the
guests
were
unutterably
shocked
to
observe
that
its
expression
had
changed
from
the
mysterious
but
fascinating
smile
to
a
vulgar
sordid
bestial
grin
which
cast
a
cold
shadow
of
moral
nastiness
into
every
heart
the
transformation
was
accompanied
by
a
sickening
stench
of
the
graveyard
the
features
faded
rapidly
away
the
body
lost
its
consistence
passing
from
the
solid
to
the
shadowy
condition
and
before
two
minutes
had
elapsed
the
had
entirely
disappeared
the
short
stranger
turned
and
confronted
the
party
with
a
long
loud
laugh
like
nothing
in
nature
the
professor
talked
excitedly
to
in
low
tones
faull
beckoned
backhouse
behind
a
wing
of
scenery
and
handed
him
his
check
without
a
word
the
medium
put
it
in
his
pocket
buttoned
his
coat
and
walked
out
of
the
room
lang
followed
him
in
order
to
get
a
drink
the
stranger
poked
his
face
up
into
maskull
s
well
giant
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
wouldn
t
you
like
to
see
the
land
where
this
sort
of
fruit
grows
wild
what
sort
of
fruit
that
specimen
maskull
waved
him
away
with
his
huge
hand
who
are
you
and
how
did
you
come
here
call
up
your
friend
perhaps
he
may
recognise
nightspore
had
moved
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
was
watching
the
embers
with
a
set
fanatical
expression
let
krag
come
to
me
if
he
wants
me
he
said
in
his
strange
voice
you
see
he
does
know
me
uttered
krag
with
a
humorous
look
walking
over
to
nightspore
he
put
a
hand
on
the
back
of
his
chair
still
the
same
old
gnawing
hunger
what
is
doing
these
days
demanded
nightspore
disdainfully
without
altering
his
attitude
surtur
has
gone
and
we
are
to
follow
how
do
you
two
come
to
know
each
other
and
of
whom
are
you
speaking
asked
maskull
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
perplexity
krag
has
something
for
us
let
us
go
outside
replied
nightspore
he
got
up
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
maskull
following
the
direction
of
his
eye
observed
that
the
few
remaining
men
were
watching
their
little
group
attentively
chapter
in
the
street
the
three
men
gathered
in
the
street
outside
the
house
the
night
was
slightly
frosty
but
particularly
clear
with
an
east
wind
blowing
the
multitude
of
blazing
stars
caused
the
sky
to
appear
like
a
vast
scroll
of
hieroglyphic
symbols
maskull
felt
oddly
excited
he
had
a
sense
that
something
extraordinary
was
about
to
happen
what
brought
you
to
this
house
tonight
krag
and
what
made
you
do
what
you
did
how
are
we
understand
that
apparition
that
must
have
been
crystalman
s
expression
on
its
face
muttered
nightspore
we
have
discussed
that
haven
t
we
maskull
maskull
is
anxious
to
behold
that
rare
fruit
in
its
native
maskull
looked
at
krag
carefully
trying
to
analyse
his
own
feelings
toward
him
he
was
distinctly
repelled
by
the
man
s
personality
yet
side
by
side
with
this
aversion
a
savage
living
energy
seemed
to
spring
up
in
his
heart
that
in
some
strange
fashion
was
attributable
to
krag
why
do
you
insist
on
this
simile
he
asked
because
it
is
apropos
nightspore
s
quite
right
that
was
crystalman
s
face
and
we
are
going
to
crystalman
s
and
where
is
this
mysterious
country
that
s
a
quaint
name
but
where
is
it
krag
grinned
showing
his
yellow
teeth
in
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
it
is
the
residential
suburb
of
what
is
he
talking
about
nightspore
do
you
mean
the
star
of
that
name
he
went
on
to
krag
which
you
have
in
front
of
you
at
this
very
minute
said
krag
pointing
a
thick
finger
toward
the
brightest
star
in
the
sky
there
you
see
arcturus
and
tormance
is
its
one
inhabited
maskull
looked
at
the
heavy
gleaming
star
and
again
at
krag
then
he
pulled
out
a
pipe
and
began
to
fill
it
you
must
have
cultivated
a
new
form
of
humour
i
am
glad
if
i
can
amuse
you
maskull
if
only
for
a
few
i
meant
to
ask
do
you
know
my
name
it
would
be
odd
if
i
didn
t
seeing
that
i
only
came
here
on
your
account
as
a
matter
of
fact
nightspore
and
i
are
old
maskull
paused
with
his
suspended
match
you
came
here
on
my
account
surely
on
your
account
and
nightspore
s
we
three
are
to
be
fellow
maskull
now
lit
his
pipe
and
puffed
away
coolly
for
a
few
moments
i
m
sorry
krag
but
i
must
assume
you
are
krag
threw
his
head
back
and
gave
a
scraping
laugh
am
i
mad
nightspore
has
surtur
gone
to
tormance
ejaculated
nightspore
in
a
strangled
voice
fixing
his
eyes
on
krag
s
face
yes
and
he
requires
that
we
follow
him
at
maskull
s
heart
began
to
beat
strangely
it
all
sounded
to
him
like
a
dream
conversation
and
since
how
long
krag
have
i
been
required
to
do
things
by
a
total
stranger
besides
who
is
this
individual
krag
s
chief
said
nightspore
turning
his
head
away
the
riddle
is
too
elaborate
for
me
i
give
you
are
looking
for
mysteries
said
krag
so
naturally
you
are
finding
them
try
and
simplify
your
ideas
my
friend
the
affair
is
plain
and
maskull
stared
hard
at
him
and
smoked
rapidly
where
have
you
come
from
now
demanded
nightspore
suddenly
from
the
old
observatory
at
starkness
have
you
heard
of
the
famous
starkness
observatory
maskull
no
where
is
it
on
the
coast
of
scotland
curious
discoveries
are
made
there
from
time
to
as
for
example
how
to
make
voyages
to
the
stars
so
this
surtur
turns
out
to
be
an
astronomer
and
you
too
presumably
krag
grinned
again
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
wind
up
your
affairs
when
can
you
be
ready
to
start
you
are
too
considerate
said
maskull
laughing
outright
i
was
beginning
to
fear
that
i
would
be
hauled
away
at
once
however
i
have
neither
wife
land
nor
profession
so
there
s
nothing
to
wait
for
what
is
the
itinerary
you
are
a
fortunate
man
a
bold
daring
heart
and
no
krag
s
features
became
suddenly
grave
and
rigid
don
t
be
a
fool
and
refuse
a
gift
of
luck
a
gift
declined
is
not
offered
a
second
krag
replied
maskull
simply
returning
his
pipe
to
his
pocket
i
ask
you
to
put
yourself
in
my
place
even
if
i
were
a
man
sick
for
adventures
how
could
i
listen
seriously
to
such
an
insane
proposition
as
this
what
do
i
know
about
you
or
your
past
record
you
may
be
a
practical
joker
or
you
may
have
come
out
of
a
know
nothing
about
it
if
you
claim
to
be
an
exceptional
man
and
want
my
cooperation
you
must
offer
me
exceptional
and
what
proofs
would
you
consider
adequate
maskull
as
he
spoke
he
gripped
maskull
s
arm
a
sharp
chilling
pain
immediately
passed
through
the
latter
s
body
and
at
the
same
moment
his
brain
caught
fire
a
light
burst
in
upon
him
like
the
rising
of
the
sun
he
asked
himself
for
the
first
time
if
this
fantastic
conversation
could
by
any
chance
refer
to
real
things
listen
krag
he
said
slowly
while
peculiar
images
and
conceptions
started
to
travel
in
rich
disorder
through
his
mind
you
talk
about
a
certain
journey
well
if
that
journey
were
a
possible
one
and
i
were
given
the
chance
of
making
it
i
would
be
willing
never
to
come
back
for
hours
on
that
arcturian
planet
i
would
give
my
life
that
is
my
attitude
toward
that
journey
now
prove
to
me
that
you
re
not
talking
nonsense
produce
your
krag
stared
at
him
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
his
face
gradually
resuming
its
jesting
expression
oh
you
will
get
your
hours
and
perhaps
longer
but
not
much
longer
you
re
an
audacious
fellow
maskull
but
this
trip
will
prove
a
little
strenuous
even
for
you
and
so
like
the
unbelievers
of
old
you
want
a
sign
from
heaven
maskull
frowned
but
the
whole
thing
is
ridiculous
our
brains
are
overexcited
by
what
took
place
in
there
let
us
go
home
and
sleep
it
krag
detained
him
with
one
hand
while
groping
in
his
breast
pocket
with
the
other
he
presently
fished
out
what
resembled
a
small
folding
lens
the
diameter
of
the
glass
did
not
exceed
two
inches
first
take
a
peep
at
arcturus
through
this
maskull
it
may
serve
as
a
provisional
sign
it
s
the
best
i
can
do
unfortunately
i
am
not
a
travelling
magician
be
very
careful
not
to
drop
it
it
s
somewhat
maskull
took
the
lens
in
his
hand
struggled
with
it
for
a
minute
and
then
looked
at
krag
in
amazement
the
little
object
weighed
at
least
twenty
pounds
though
it
was
not
much
bigger
than
a
crown
piece
what
stuff
can
this
be
krag
look
through
it
my
good
friend
that
s
what
i
gave
it
to
you
maskull
held
it
up
with
difficulty
directed
it
toward
the
gleaming
arcturus
and
snatched
as
long
and
as
steady
a
glance
at
the
star
as
the
muscles
of
his
arm
would
permit
what
he
saw
was
this
the
star
which
to
the
naked
eye
appeared
as
a
single
yellow
point
of
light
now
became
clearly
split
into
two
bright
but
minute
suns
the
larger
of
which
was
still
yellow
while
its
smaller
companion
was
a
beautiful
blue
but
this
was
not
all
apparently
circulating
around
the
yellow
sun
was
a
comparatively
small
and
hardly
distinguishable
satellite
which
seemed
to
shine
not
by
its
own
but
by
reflected
light
maskull
lowered
and
raised
his
arm
repeatedly
the
same
spectacle
revealed
itself
again
and
again
but
he
was
able
to
see
nothing
else
then
he
passed
back
the
lens
to
krag
without
a
word
and
stood
chewing
his
underlip
you
take
a
glimpse
too
scraped
krag
proffering
the
glass
to
nightspore
nightspore
turned
his
back
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
krag
laughed
sardonically
and
returned
the
lens
to
his
pocket
well
maskull
are
you
satisfied
arcturus
then
is
a
double
sun
and
is
that
third
point
the
planet
tormance
our
future
home
maskull
continued
to
ponder
you
inquire
if
i
am
satisfied
i
don
t
know
krag
it
s
miraculous
and
that
s
all
i
can
say
about
it
but
i
m
satisfied
of
one
thing
there
must
be
very
wonderful
astronomers
at
starkness
and
if
you
invite
me
to
your
observatory
i
will
surely
i
do
invite
you
we
set
off
from
and
you
nightspore
demanded
maskull
the
journey
has
to
be
made
answered
his
friend
in
indistinct
tones
though
i
don
t
see
what
will
come
of
krag
shot
a
penetrating
glance
at
him
more
remarkable
adventures
than
this
would
need
to
be
arranged
before
we
could
excite
yet
he
is
but
not
con
amore
he
is
coming
merely
to
bear
you
maskull
again
sought
the
heavy
sombre
star
gleaming
in
solitary
might
in
the
heavens
and
as
he
gazed
his
heart
swelled
with
grand
and
painful
longings
for
which
however
he
was
unable
to
account
to
his
own
intellect
he
felt
that
his
destiny
was
in
some
way
bound
up
with
this
gigantic
sun
but
still
he
did
not
dare
to
admit
to
himself
krag
s
seriousness
he
heard
his
parting
remarks
in
deep
abstraction
and
only
after
the
lapse
of
several
minutes
when
alone
with
nightspore
did
he
realise
that
they
referred
to
such
mundane
matters
as
travelling
routes
and
times
of
trains
does
krag
travel
north
with
us
nightspore
i
didn
t
catch
no
we
go
on
first
and
he
joins
us
at
starkness
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
maskull
remained
thoughtful
what
am
i
to
think
of
that
man
for
your
information
replied
nightspore
wearily
i
have
never
known
him
to
chapter
starkness
a
couple
of
days
later
at
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
maskull
and
nightspore
arrived
at
starkness
observatory
having
covered
the
seven
miles
from
haillar
station
on
foot
the
road
very
wild
and
lonely
ran
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
near
the
edge
of
rather
lofty
cliffs
within
sight
of
the
north
sea
the
sun
shone
but
a
brisk
east
wind
was
blowing
and
the
air
was
salt
and
cold
the
dark
green
waves
were
flecked
with
white
throughout
the
walk
they
were
accompanied
by
the
plaintive
beautiful
crying
of
the
gulls
the
observatory
presented
itself
to
their
eyes
as
a
little
community
without
neighbours
and
perched
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
land
there
were
three
buildings
a
small
dwelling
house
a
low
workshop
and
about
two
hundred
yards
farther
north
a
square
tower
of
granite
masonry
seventy
feet
in
height
the
house
and
the
shop
were
separated
by
an
open
yard
littered
with
waste
a
single
stone
wall
surrounded
both
except
on
the
side
facing
the
sea
where
the
house
itself
formed
a
continuation
of
the
cliff
no
one
appeared
the
windows
were
all
closed
and
maskull
could
have
sworn
that
the
whole
establishment
was
shut
up
and
deserted
he
passed
through
the
open
gate
followed
by
nightspore
and
knocked
vigorously
at
the
front
door
the
knocker
was
thick
with
dust
and
had
obviously
not
been
used
for
a
long
time
he
put
his
ear
to
the
door
but
could
hear
no
movements
inside
the
house
he
then
tried
the
handle
the
door
was
looked
they
walked
around
the
house
looking
for
another
entrance
but
there
was
only
the
one
door
this
isn
t
promising
growled
maskull
there
s
no
one
here
now
you
try
the
shed
while
i
go
over
to
that
nightspore
who
had
not
spoken
half
a
dozen
words
since
leaving
the
train
complied
in
silence
and
started
off
across
the
yard
maskull
passed
out
of
the
gate
again
when
he
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
which
stood
some
way
back
from
the
cliff
he
found
the
door
heavily
padlocked
gazing
up
he
saw
six
windows
one
above
the
other
at
equal
distances
all
on
the
east
is
overlooking
the
sea
realising
that
no
satisfaction
was
to
be
gained
here
he
came
away
again
still
more
irritated
than
before
when
he
rejoined
his
friend
nightspore
reported
that
the
workshop
was
also
locked
did
we
or
did
we
not
receive
an
invitation
demanded
maskull
energetically
the
house
is
empty
replied
nightspore
biting
his
nails
better
break
a
i
certainly
don
t
mean
to
camp
out
till
krag
condescends
to
he
picked
up
an
old
iron
bolt
from
the
yard
and
retreating
to
a
safe
distance
hurled
it
against
a
sash
window
on
the
ground
floor
the
lower
pane
was
completely
shattered
carefully
avoiding
the
broken
glass
maskull
thrust
his
hand
through
the
aperture
and
pushed
back
the
frame
fastening
a
minute
later
they
had
climbed
through
and
were
standing
inside
the
house
the
room
which
was
a
kitchen
was
in
an
indescribably
filthy
and
neglected
condition
the
furniture
scarcely
held
together
broken
utensils
and
rubbish
lay
on
the
floor
instead
of
on
the
dust
heap
everything
was
covered
with
a
deep
deposit
of
dust
the
atmosphere
was
so
foul
that
maskull
judged
that
no
fresh
air
had
passed
into
the
room
for
several
months
insects
were
crawling
on
the
walls
they
went
into
the
other
rooms
on
the
lower
scullery
a
barely
furnished
dining
room
and
a
storing
place
for
lumber
the
same
dirt
mustiness
and
neglect
met
their
eyes
at
least
half
a
year
must
have
elapsed
since
these
rooms
were
last
touched
or
even
entered
does
your
faith
in
krag
still
hold
asked
maskull
i
confess
mine
is
at
vanishing
point
if
this
affair
isn
t
one
big
practical
joke
it
has
every
promise
of
being
one
krag
never
lived
here
in
his
come
upstairs
first
said
nightspore
the
upstairs
rooms
proved
to
consist
of
a
library
and
three
bedrooms
all
the
windows
were
tightly
closed
and
the
air
was
insufferable
the
beds
had
been
slept
in
evidently
a
long
time
ago
and
had
never
been
made
since
the
tumbled
discoloured
bed
linen
actually
preserved
the
impressions
of
the
sleepers
there
was
no
doubt
that
these
impressions
were
ancient
for
all
sorts
of
floating
dirt
had
accumulated
on
the
sheets
and
coverlets
who
could
have
slept
here
do
you
think
interrogated
maskull
the
observatory
staff
more
likely
travellers
like
ourselves
they
left
maskull
flung
the
windows
wide
open
in
every
room
he
came
to
and
held
his
breath
until
he
had
done
so
two
of
the
bedrooms
faced
the
sea
the
third
the
library
the
moorland
this
library
was
now
the
only
room
left
unvisited
and
unless
they
discovered
signs
of
recent
occupation
here
maskull
made
up
his
mind
to
regard
the
whole
business
as
a
gigantic
hoax
but
the
library
like
all
the
other
rooms
was
foul
with
stale
air
and
maskull
having
flung
the
window
up
and
down
fell
heavily
into
an
armchair
and
looked
disgustedly
at
his
friend
now
what
is
your
opinion
of
krag
nightspore
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
which
stood
before
the
window
he
may
still
have
left
a
message
for
what
message
why
do
you
mean
in
this
room
see
no
nightspore
s
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
finally
seeming
to
linger
upon
a
wall
cupboard
which
contained
a
few
old
bottles
on
one
of
the
shelves
and
nothing
else
maskull
glanced
at
him
and
at
the
cupboard
then
without
a
word
he
got
up
to
examine
the
bottles
there
were
four
altogether
one
of
which
was
larger
than
the
rest
the
smaller
ones
were
about
eight
inches
long
all
were
but
had
flattened
bottoms
which
enabled
them
to
stand
upright
two
of
the
smaller
ones
were
empty
and
unstoppered
the
others
contained
a
colourless
liquid
and
possessed
stoppers
that
were
connected
by
a
thin
metal
rod
with
a
catch
halfway
down
the
side
of
the
bottle
they
were
labelled
but
the
labels
were
yellow
with
age
and
the
writing
was
nearly
undecipherable
maskull
carried
the
filled
bottles
with
him
to
the
table
in
front
of
the
window
in
order
to
get
better
light
nightspore
moved
away
to
make
room
for
him
he
now
made
out
on
the
larger
bottle
the
words
solar
back
rays
and
on
the
other
one
after
some
doubt
he
thought
that
he
could
distinguish
something
like
arcturian
back
he
looked
up
to
stare
curiously
at
his
friend
have
you
been
here
before
nightspore
i
guessed
krag
would
leave
a
well
i
don
t
may
be
a
message
but
it
means
nothing
to
us
or
at
all
events
to
me
what
are
back
rays
light
that
goes
back
to
its
source
muttered
nightspore
and
what
kind
of
light
would
that
be
nightspore
seemed
unwilling
to
answer
but
finding
maskull
s
eyes
still
fixed
on
him
he
brought
out
unless
light
pulled
as
well
as
pushed
how
would
flowers
contrive
to
twist
their
heads
around
after
the
sun
i
don
t
know
but
the
point
is
what
are
these
bottles
for
while
he
was
still
talking
with
his
hand
on
the
smaller
bottle
the
other
which
was
lying
on
its
side
accidentally
rolled
over
in
such
a
manner
that
the
metal
caught
against
the
table
he
made
a
movement
to
stop
it
his
hand
was
actually
descending
bottle
suddenly
disappeared
before
his
eyes
it
had
not
rolled
off
the
table
but
had
really
was
nowhere
at
all
maskull
stared
at
the
table
after
a
minute
he
raised
his
brows
and
turned
to
nightspore
with
a
smile
the
message
grows
more
nightspore
looked
bored
the
valve
became
unfastened
the
contents
have
escaped
through
the
open
window
toward
the
sun
carrying
the
bottle
with
them
but
the
bottle
will
be
burned
up
by
the
earth
s
atmosphere
and
the
contents
will
dissipate
and
will
not
reach
the
maskull
listened
attentively
and
his
smile
faded
does
anything
prevent
us
from
experimenting
with
this
other
bottle
replace
it
in
the
cupboard
said
nightspore
arcturus
is
still
below
the
horizon
and
you
would
succeed
only
in
wrecking
the
maskull
remained
standing
before
the
window
pensively
gazing
out
at
the
sunlit
moors
krag
treats
me
like
a
child
he
remarked
presently
and
perhaps
i
really
am
a
child
my
cynicism
must
seem
most
amusing
to
krag
but
why
does
he
leave
me
to
find
out
all
this
by
i
don
t
include
you
nightspore
but
what
time
will
krag
be
here
not
before
dark
i
expect
his
friend
replied
chapter
the
voice
it
was
by
this
time
past
three
o
clock
feeling
hungry
for
they
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
morning
maskull
went
downstairs
to
forage
but
without
much
hope
of
finding
anything
in
the
shape
of
food
in
a
safe
in
the
kitchen
he
discovered
a
bag
of
mouldy
oatmeal
which
was
untouchable
a
quantity
of
quite
good
tea
in
an
airtight
caddy
and
an
unopened
can
of
ox
tongue
best
of
all
in
the
cupboard
he
came
across
an
uncorked
bottle
of
scotch
whisky
he
at
once
made
preparations
for
a
scratch
meal
a
pump
in
the
yard
ran
clear
after
a
good
deal
of
hard
working
at
it
and
he
washed
out
and
filled
the
antique
kettle
for
firewood
one
of
the
kitchen
chairs
was
broken
up
with
a
chopper
the
light
dusty
wood
made
a
good
blaze
in
the
grate
the
kettle
was
boiled
and
cups
were
procured
and
washed
ten
minutes
later
the
friends
were
dining
in
the
library
nightspore
ate
and
drank
little
but
maskull
sat
down
with
good
appetite
there
being
no
milk
whisky
took
the
place
of
it
the
nearly
black
tea
was
mixed
with
an
equal
quantity
of
the
spirit
of
this
concoction
maskull
drank
cup
after
cup
and
long
after
the
tongue
had
disappeared
he
was
still
imbibing
nightspore
looked
at
him
queerly
do
you
intend
to
finish
the
bottle
before
krag
comes
krag
won
t
want
any
and
one
must
do
something
i
feel
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
the
cup
which
was
on
its
way
to
maskull
s
lips
remained
poised
in
the
air
have
you
anything
in
view
nightspore
let
us
walk
out
to
the
gap
of
what
s
that
a
showplace
answered
nightspore
biting
his
lip
maskull
finished
off
the
cup
and
rose
to
his
feet
walking
is
better
than
soaking
at
any
time
and
especially
on
a
day
like
this
how
far
is
it
three
or
four
miles
each
you
probably
mean
something
said
maskull
for
i
m
beginning
to
regard
you
as
a
second
krag
but
if
so
so
much
the
better
i
am
growing
nervous
and
need
they
left
the
house
by
the
door
which
they
left
ajar
and
immediately
found
themselves
again
on
the
moorland
road
that
had
brought
them
from
haillar
this
time
they
continued
along
it
past
the
tower
maskull
as
they
went
by
regarded
the
erection
with
puzzled
interest
what
is
that
tower
nightspore
we
sail
from
the
platform
on
the
tonight
him
a
quick
look
maskull
smiled
but
his
eyes
were
grave
then
we
are
looking
at
the
gateway
of
arcturus
and
krag
is
now
travelling
north
to
unlock
you
no
longer
think
it
impossible
i
fancy
mumbled
nightspore
after
a
mile
or
two
the
road
parted
from
the
sea
coast
and
swerved
sharply
inland
across
the
hills
with
nightspore
as
guide
they
left
it
and
took
to
the
grass
a
faint
sheep
path
marked
the
way
along
the
cliff
edge
for
some
distance
but
at
the
end
of
another
mile
it
vanished
the
two
men
then
had
some
rough
walking
up
and
down
hillsides
and
across
deep
gullies
the
sun
disappeared
behind
the
hills
and
twilight
imperceptibly
came
on
they
soon
reached
a
spot
where
further
progress
appeared
impossible
the
buttress
of
a
mountain
descended
at
a
steep
angle
to
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
forming
an
impassable
slope
of
slippery
grass
maskull
halted
stroked
his
beard
and
wondered
what
the
next
step
was
to
be
there
s
a
little
scrambling
here
said
nightspore
we
are
both
used
to
climbing
and
there
is
not
much
in
he
indicated
a
narrow
ledge
winding
along
the
face
of
the
precipice
a
few
yards
beneath
where
they
were
standing
it
averaged
from
fifteen
to
thirty
inches
in
width
without
waiting
for
maskull
s
consent
to
the
undertaking
he
instantly
swung
himself
down
and
started
walking
along
this
ledge
at
a
rapid
pace
maskull
seeing
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
followed
him
the
shelf
did
not
extend
for
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
its
passage
was
somewhat
unnerving
there
was
a
sheer
drop
to
the
sea
four
hundred
feet
below
in
a
few
places
they
had
to
sidle
along
without
placing
one
foot
before
another
the
sound
of
the
breakers
came
up
to
them
in
a
low
threatening
roar
upon
rounding
a
corner
the
ledge
broadened
out
into
a
platform
of
rock
and
came
to
a
sudden
end
a
narrow
inlet
of
the
sea
separated
them
from
the
continuation
of
the
cliffs
beyond
as
we
can
t
get
any
further
said
maskull
i
presume
this
is
your
gap
of
sorgie
yes
answered
his
friend
first
dropping
on
his
knees
and
then
lying
at
full
length
face
downward
he
drew
his
head
and
shoulders
over
the
edge
and
began
to
stare
straight
down
at
the
water
what
is
there
interesting
down
there
nightspore
receiving
no
reply
however
he
followed
his
friend
s
example
and
the
next
minute
was
looking
for
himself
nothing
was
to
be
seen
the
gloom
had
deepened
and
the
sea
was
nearly
invisible
but
while
he
was
ineffectually
gazing
he
heard
what
sounded
like
the
beating
of
a
drum
on
the
narrow
strip
of
shore
below
it
was
very
faint
but
quite
distinct
the
beats
were
in
time
with
the
third
beat
slightly
accented
he
now
continued
to
hear
the
noise
all
the
time
he
was
lying
there
the
beats
were
in
no
way
drowned
by
the
far
louder
sound
of
the
surf
but
seemed
somehow
to
belong
to
a
different
world
when
they
were
on
their
feet
again
he
questioned
nightspore
we
came
here
solely
to
hear
that
nightspore
cast
one
of
his
odd
looks
at
him
it
s
called
locally
the
drum
taps
of
you
will
not
hear
that
name
again
but
perhaps
you
will
hear
the
sound
and
if
i
do
what
will
it
imply
demanded
maskull
in
amazement
it
bears
its
own
message
only
try
always
to
hear
it
more
and
more
distinctly
now
it
s
growing
dark
and
we
must
get
maskull
pulled
out
his
watch
automatically
and
looked
at
the
time
it
was
past
six
but
he
was
thinking
of
nightspore
s
words
and
not
of
the
time
night
had
already
fallen
by
the
time
they
regained
the
tower
the
black
sky
was
glorious
with
liquid
stars
arcturus
was
a
little
way
above
the
sea
directly
opposite
them
in
the
east
as
they
were
passing
the
base
of
the
tower
maskull
observed
with
a
sudden
shock
that
the
gate
was
open
he
caught
hold
of
nightspore
s
arm
violently
look
krag
is
yes
we
must
make
haste
to
the
and
why
not
the
tower
he
s
probably
in
there
since
the
gate
is
open
i
m
going
up
to
nightspore
grunted
but
made
no
opposition
all
was
inside
the
gate
maskull
struck
a
match
and
the
flickering
light
disclosed
the
lower
end
of
a
circular
flight
of
stone
steps
are
you
coming
up
he
asked
no
i
ll
wait
maskull
immediately
began
the
ascent
hardly
had
he
mounted
half
a
dozen
steps
however
before
he
was
compelled
to
pause
to
gain
breath
he
seemed
to
be
carrying
upstairs
not
one
maskull
but
three
as
he
proceeded
the
sensation
of
crushing
weight
so
far
from
diminishing
grew
worse
and
worse
it
was
nearly
physically
impossible
to
go
on
his
lungs
could
not
take
in
enough
oxygen
while
his
heart
thumped
like
a
ship
s
engine
sweat
coursed
down
his
face
at
the
twentieth
step
he
completed
the
first
revolution
of
the
tower
and
came
face
to
face
with
the
first
window
which
was
set
in
a
high
embrasure
realising
that
he
could
go
no
higher
he
struck
another
match
and
climbed
into
the
embrasure
in
order
that
he
might
at
all
events
see
something
from
the
tower
the
flame
died
and
he
stared
through
the
window
at
the
stars
then
to
his
astonishment
he
discovered
that
it
was
not
a
window
at
all
but
a
lens
the
sky
was
not
a
wide
expanse
of
space
containing
a
multitude
of
stars
but
a
blurred
darkness
focused
only
in
one
part
where
two
very
bright
stars
like
small
moons
in
size
appeared
in
close
conjunction
and
near
them
a
more
minute
planetary
object
as
brilliant
as
venus
and
with
an
observable
disk
one
of
the
suns
shone
with
a
glaring
white
light
the
other
was
a
weird
and
awful
blue
their
light
though
almost
solar
in
intensity
did
not
illuminate
the
interior
of
the
tower
maskull
knew
at
once
that
the
system
of
spheres
at
which
he
was
gazing
was
what
is
known
to
astronomy
as
the
star
arcturus
he
had
seen
the
sight
before
through
krag
s
glass
but
then
the
scale
had
been
smaller
the
colors
of
the
twin
suns
had
not
appeared
in
their
naked
reality
these
colors
seemed
to
him
most
marvellous
as
if
in
seeing
them
through
earth
eyes
he
was
not
seeing
them
correctly
but
it
was
at
tormance
that
he
stared
the
longest
and
the
most
earnestly
on
that
mysterious
and
terrible
earth
countless
millions
of
miles
distant
it
had
been
promised
him
that
he
would
set
foot
even
though
he
might
leave
his
bones
there
the
strange
creatures
that
he
was
to
behold
and
touch
were
already
living
at
this
very
moment
a
low
sighing
whisper
sounded
in
his
ear
from
not
more
than
a
yard
away
don
t
you
understand
maskull
that
you
are
only
an
instrument
to
be
used
and
then
broken
nightspore
is
asleep
now
but
when
he
wakes
you
must
die
you
will
go
but
he
will
maskull
hastily
struck
another
match
with
trembling
fingers
no
one
was
in
sight
and
all
was
quiet
as
the
tomb
the
voice
did
not
sound
again
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
he
redescended
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
on
gaining
the
open
air
his
sensation
of
weight
was
instantly
removed
but
he
continued
panting
and
palpitating
like
a
man
who
has
lifted
a
far
too
heavy
load
nightspore
s
dark
form
came
forward
was
krag
there
if
he
was
i
didn
t
see
him
but
i
heard
someone
was
it
krag
it
was
not
a
voice
warned
me
against
yes
you
will
hear
these
voices
too
said
nightspore
enigmatically
chapter
the
night
of
departure
when
they
returned
to
the
house
the
windows
were
all
in
darkness
and
the
door
was
ajar
just
as
they
had
left
it
krag
presumably
was
not
there
maskull
went
all
over
the
house
striking
matches
in
every
the
end
of
the
examination
he
was
ready
to
swear
that
the
man
they
were
expecting
had
not
even
stuck
his
nose
inside
the
premises
groping
their
way
into
the
library
they
sat
down
in
the
total
darkness
to
wait
for
nothing
else
remained
to
be
done
maskull
lit
his
pipe
and
began
to
drink
the
remainder
of
the
whisky
through
the
open
window
sounded
in
their
ears
the
trainlike
grinding
of
the
sea
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
krag
must
be
in
the
tower
after
all
remarked
maskull
breaking
the
silence
yes
he
is
getting
i
hope
he
doesn
t
expect
us
to
join
him
there
it
was
beyond
my
why
heaven
knows
the
stairs
must
have
a
magnetic
pull
of
some
it
is
tormantic
gravity
muttered
nightspore
i
understand
rather
i
don
it
doesn
t
he
went
on
smoking
in
silence
occasionally
taking
a
mouthful
of
the
neat
liquor
who
is
surtur
he
demanded
abruptly
we
others
are
gropers
and
bunglers
but
he
is
a
maskull
digested
this
i
fancy
you
are
right
for
though
i
know
nothing
about
him
his
mere
name
has
an
exciting
effect
on
me
are
you
personally
acquainted
with
him
i
must
be
i
forget
replied
nightspore
in
a
choking
voice
maskull
looked
up
surprised
but
could
make
nothing
out
in
the
blackness
of
the
room
do
you
know
so
many
extraordinary
men
that
you
can
forget
some
of
them
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
this
will
we
meet
him
where
we
are
going
you
will
meet
death
maskull
ask
me
no
more
can
t
answer
then
let
us
go
on
waiting
for
krag
said
maskull
coldly
ten
minutes
later
the
front
door
slammed
and
a
light
quick
footstep
was
heard
running
up
the
stairs
maskull
got
up
with
a
beating
heart
krag
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
bearing
in
his
hand
a
feebly
glimmering
lantern
a
hat
was
on
his
head
and
he
looked
stern
and
forbidding
after
scrutinising
the
two
friends
for
a
moment
or
so
he
strode
into
the
room
and
thrust
the
lantern
on
the
table
its
light
hardly
served
to
illuminate
the
walls
you
have
got
here
then
maskull
so
it
i
shan
t
thank
you
for
your
hospitality
for
it
has
been
conspicuous
by
its
krag
ignored
the
remark
are
you
ready
to
start
by
all
you
are
it
is
not
so
entertaining
krag
surveyed
him
critically
i
heard
you
stumbling
about
in
the
tower
you
couldn
t
get
up
it
it
looks
like
an
obstacle
for
nightspore
informs
me
that
the
start
takes
place
from
the
but
your
other
doubts
are
all
removed
so
far
krag
that
i
now
possess
an
open
mind
i
am
quite
willing
to
see
what
you
can
nothing
more
is
asked
but
this
tower
business
you
know
that
until
you
are
able
to
climb
to
the
top
you
are
unfit
to
stand
the
gravitation
of
tormance
then
i
repeat
it
s
an
awkward
obstacle
for
i
certainly
can
t
get
krag
hunted
about
in
his
pockets
and
at
length
produced
a
clasp
knife
remove
your
coat
and
roll
up
your
shirt
sleeve
he
directed
do
you
propose
to
make
an
incision
with
that
yes
and
don
t
start
difficulties
because
the
effect
is
certain
but
you
can
t
possibly
understand
it
still
a
cut
with
a
began
maskull
laughing
it
will
answer
maskull
interrupted
nightspore
then
bare
your
arm
too
you
aristocrat
of
the
universe
said
krag
let
us
see
what
your
blood
is
made
nightspore
obeyed
krag
pulled
out
the
big
blade
of
the
knife
and
made
a
careless
and
almost
savage
slash
at
maskull
s
upper
arm
the
wound
was
deep
and
blood
flowed
freely
do
i
bind
it
up
asked
maskull
scowling
with
pain
krag
spat
on
the
wound
pull
your
shirt
down
it
won
t
bleed
any
he
then
turned
his
attention
to
nightspore
who
endured
his
operation
with
grim
indifference
krag
threw
the
knife
on
the
floor
an
awful
agony
emanating
from
the
wound
started
to
run
through
maskull
s
body
and
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
would
not
have
to
faint
but
it
subsided
almost
immediately
and
then
he
felt
nothing
but
a
gnawing
ache
in
the
injured
arm
just
strong
enough
to
make
life
one
long
discomfort
that
s
finished
said
krag
now
you
can
follow
picking
up
the
lantern
he
walked
toward
the
door
the
others
hastened
after
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
light
and
a
moment
later
their
footsteps
clattering
down
the
uncarpeted
stairs
resounded
through
the
deserted
house
krag
waited
till
they
were
out
and
then
banged
the
front
door
after
them
with
such
violence
that
the
windows
shook
while
they
were
walking
swiftly
across
to
the
tower
maskull
caught
his
arm
i
heard
a
voice
up
those
what
did
it
say
that
i
am
to
go
but
nightspore
is
to
krag
smiled
the
journey
is
getting
notorious
he
remarked
after
a
pause
there
must
be
about
well
do
you
want
to
return
i
don
t
know
what
i
want
but
i
thought
the
thing
was
curious
enough
to
be
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
hear
voices
said
krag
but
you
mustn
t
for
a
minute
imagine
that
all
is
wise
that
comes
to
you
out
of
the
night
when
they
had
arrived
at
the
open
gateway
of
the
tower
he
immediately
set
foot
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
spiral
staircase
and
ran
nimbly
up
bearing
the
lantern
maskull
followed
him
with
some
trepidation
in
view
of
his
previous
painful
experience
on
these
stairs
but
when
after
the
first
steps
he
discovered
that
he
was
still
breathing
freely
his
dread
changed
to
relief
and
astonishment
and
he
could
have
chattered
like
a
girl
at
the
lowest
window
krag
went
straight
ahead
without
stopping
but
maskull
clambered
into
the
embrasure
in
order
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
the
miraculous
spectacle
of
the
arcturian
group
the
lens
had
lost
its
magic
property
it
had
become
a
common
sheet
of
glass
through
which
the
ordinary
sky
field
appeared
the
climb
continued
and
at
the
second
and
third
windows
he
again
mounted
and
stared
out
but
still
the
common
sights
presented
themselves
after
that
he
gave
up
and
looked
through
no
more
windows
krag
and
nightspore
meanwhile
had
gone
on
ahead
with
the
light
so
that
he
had
to
complete
the
ascent
in
darkness
when
he
was
near
the
top
he
saw
yellow
light
shining
through
the
crack
of
a
door
his
companions
were
standing
just
inside
a
small
room
shut
off
from
the
staircase
by
rough
wooden
planking
it
was
rudely
furnished
and
contained
nothing
of
astronomical
interest
the
lantern
was
resting
on
a
table
maskull
walked
in
and
looked
around
him
with
curiosity
are
we
at
the
top
except
for
the
platform
over
our
heads
replied
krag
why
didn
t
that
lowest
window
magnify
as
it
did
earlier
in
the
evening
oh
you
missed
your
opportunity
said
krag
grinning
if
you
had
finished
your
climb
then
you
would
have
seen
sights
from
the
fifth
window
for
example
you
would
have
seen
tormance
like
a
continent
in
relief
from
the
sixth
you
would
have
seen
it
like
a
landscape
but
now
there
s
no
why
what
has
need
got
to
do
with
it
things
are
changed
my
friend
since
that
wound
of
yours
for
the
same
reason
that
you
have
now
been
able
to
mount
the
stairs
there
was
no
necessity
to
stop
and
gape
at
illusions
en
very
well
said
maskull
not
quite
understanding
what
he
meant
but
is
this
surtur
s
den
he
has
spent
time
i
wish
you
would
describe
this
mysterious
individual
krag
we
may
not
get
another
what
i
said
about
the
windows
also
applies
to
surtur
there
s
no
need
to
waste
time
over
visualising
him
because
you
are
immediately
going
on
to
the
then
let
us
he
pressed
his
eyeballs
wearily
do
we
strip
asked
nightspore
naturally
answered
krag
and
he
began
to
tear
off
his
clothes
with
slow
uncouth
movements
why
demanded
maskull
following
however
the
example
of
the
other
two
men
krag
thumped
his
vast
chest
which
was
covered
with
thick
hairs
like
an
ape
s
who
knows
what
the
tormance
fashions
are
like
we
may
sprout
don
t
say
we
exclaimed
maskull
pausing
in
the
middle
of
his
undressing
krag
smote
him
on
the
back
new
pleasure
organs
possible
maskull
you
like
that
the
three
men
stood
as
nature
made
them
maskull
s
spirits
rose
fast
as
the
moment
of
departure
drew
near
a
farewell
drink
to
success
cried
krag
seizing
a
bottle
and
breaking
its
head
off
between
his
fingers
there
were
no
glasses
but
he
poured
the
wine
into
some
cracked
cups
perceiving
that
the
others
drank
maskull
tossed
off
his
cupful
it
was
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
draught
of
liquid
electricity
krag
dropped
onto
the
floor
and
rolled
around
on
his
back
kicking
his
legs
in
the
air
he
tried
to
drag
maskull
down
on
top
of
him
and
a
little
horseplay
went
on
between
the
two
nightspore
took
no
part
in
it
but
walked
to
and
fro
like
a
hungry
caged
animal
suddenly
from
there
came
a
single
prolonged
piercing
wail
such
as
a
banshee
might
be
imagined
to
utter
it
ceased
abruptly
and
was
not
repeated
what
s
that
called
out
maskull
disengaging
himself
impatiently
from
krag
krag
rocked
with
laughter
a
scottish
spirit
trying
to
reproduce
the
bagpipes
of
its
earth
honour
of
our
nightspore
turned
to
krag
maskull
will
sleep
throughout
the
journey
and
you
too
if
you
wish
my
altruistic
friend
i
am
pilot
and
you
passengers
can
amuse
yourselves
as
you
are
we
off
at
last
asked
maskull
yes
you
are
about
to
cross
your
rubicon
maskull
but
what
a
rubicon
do
you
know
that
it
takes
light
a
hundred
years
or
so
to
arrive
here
from
arcturus
yet
we
shall
do
it
in
nineteen
then
you
assert
that
surtur
is
already
there
surtur
is
where
he
is
he
is
a
great
won
t
i
see
him
krag
went
up
to
him
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
don
t
forget
that
you
have
asked
for
it
and
wanted
it
few
people
in
tormance
will
know
more
about
him
than
you
do
but
your
memory
will
be
your
worst
he
led
the
way
up
a
short
iron
ladder
mounting
through
a
trap
to
the
flat
roof
above
when
they
were
up
he
switched
on
a
small
electric
torch
maskull
beheld
with
awe
the
torpedo
of
crystal
that
was
to
convey
them
through
the
whole
breadth
of
visible
space
it
was
forty
feet
long
eight
wide
and
eight
high
the
tank
containing
the
arcturian
back
rays
was
in
front
the
car
behind
the
nose
of
the
torpedo
was
directed
toward
the
sky
the
whole
machine
rested
upon
a
flat
platform
raised
about
four
feet
above
the
level
of
the
roof
so
as
to
encounter
no
obstruction
on
starting
its
flight
krag
flashed
the
light
on
to
the
door
of
the
car
to
enable
them
to
enter
before
doing
so
maskull
gazed
sternly
once
again
at
the
gigantic
star
which
was
to
be
their
sun
from
now
onward
he
frowned
shivered
slightly
and
got
in
beside
nightspore
krag
clambered
past
them
onto
his
pilot
s
seat
he
threw
the
flashlight
through
the
open
door
which
was
then
carefully
closed
fastened
and
screwed
up
he
pulled
the
starting
lever
the
torpedo
glided
gently
from
its
platform
and
passed
rather
slowly
away
from
the
tower
seaward
its
speed
increased
sensibly
though
not
excessively
until
the
approximate
limits
of
the
earth
s
atmosphere
were
reached
krag
then
released
the
speed
valve
and
the
car
sped
on
its
way
with
a
velocity
more
nearly
approaching
that
of
thought
than
of
light
maskull
had
no
opportunity
of
examining
through
the
crystal
walls
the
rapidly
changing
panorama
of
the
heavens
an
extreme
drowsiness
oppressed
him
he
opened
his
eyes
violently
a
dozen
times
but
on
the
thirteenth
attempt
he
failed
from
that
time
forward
he
slept
heavily
the
bored
hungry
expression
never
left
nightspore
s
face
the
alterations
in
the
aspect
of
the
sky
seemed
to
possess
not
the
least
interest
for
him
krag
sat
with
his
hand
on
the
lever
watching
with
savage
intentness
his
phosphorescent
charts
and
gauges
chapter
joiwind
it
was
dense
night
when
maskull
awoke
from
his
profound
sleep
a
wind
was
blowing
against
him
gentle
but
such
as
he
had
never
experienced
on
earth
he
remained
sprawling
on
the
ground
as
he
was
unable
to
lift
his
body
because
of
its
intense
weight
a
numbing
pain
which
he
could
not
identify
with
any
region
of
his
frame
acted
from
now
onward
as
a
lower
sympathetic
note
to
all
his
other
sensations
it
gnawed
away
at
him
continuously
sometimes
it
embittered
and
irritated
him
at
other
times
he
forgot
it
he
felt
something
hard
on
his
forehead
putting
his
hand
up
he
discovered
there
a
fleshy
protuberance
the
size
of
a
small
plum
having
a
cavity
in
the
middle
of
which
he
could
not
feel
the
bottom
then
he
also
became
aware
of
a
large
knob
on
each
side
of
his
neck
an
inch
below
the
ear
from
the
region
of
his
heart
a
tentacle
had
budded
it
was
as
long
as
his
arm
but
thin
like
whipcord
and
soft
and
flexible
as
soon
as
he
thoroughly
realised
the
significance
of
these
new
organs
his
heart
began
to
pump
whatever
might
or
might
not
be
their
use
they
proved
one
he
was
in
a
new
world
one
part
of
the
sky
began
to
get
lighter
than
the
rest
maskull
cried
out
to
his
companions
but
received
no
response
this
frightened
him
he
went
on
shouting
out
at
irregular
alarmed
at
the
silence
and
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
finally
as
no
answering
hail
came
he
thought
it
wiser
not
to
make
too
much
noise
and
after
that
he
lay
quiet
waiting
in
cold
blood
for
what
might
happen
in
a
short
while
he
perceived
dim
shadows
around
him
but
these
were
not
his
friends
a
pale
milky
vapour
over
the
ground
began
to
succeed
the
black
night
while
in
the
upper
sky
rosy
tints
appeared
on
earth
one
would
have
said
that
day
was
breaking
the
brightness
went
on
imperceptibly
increasing
for
a
very
long
time
maskull
then
discovered
that
he
was
lying
on
sand
the
colour
of
the
sand
was
scarlet
the
obscure
shadows
he
had
seen
were
bushes
with
black
stems
and
purple
leaves
so
far
nothing
else
was
visible
the
day
surged
up
it
was
too
misty
for
direct
sunshine
but
before
long
the
brilliance
of
the
light
was
already
greater
than
that
of
the
midday
sun
on
earth
the
heat
too
was
intense
but
maskull
welcomed
relieved
his
pain
and
diminished
his
sense
of
crushing
weight
the
wind
had
dropped
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
he
now
tried
to
get
onto
his
feet
but
succeeded
only
in
kneeling
he
was
unable
to
see
far
the
mists
had
no
more
than
partially
dissolved
and
all
that
he
could
distinguish
was
a
narrow
circle
of
red
sand
dotted
with
ten
or
twenty
bushes
he
felt
a
soft
cool
touch
on
the
back
of
his
neck
he
started
forward
in
nervous
fright
and
in
doing
so
tumbled
over
onto
the
sand
looking
up
over
his
shoulder
quickly
he
was
astounded
to
see
a
woman
standing
beside
him
she
was
clothed
in
a
single
flowing
pale
green
garment
rather
classically
draped
according
to
earth
standards
she
was
not
beautiful
for
although
her
face
was
otherwise
human
she
was
the
additional
disfiguring
organs
that
maskull
had
discovered
in
himself
she
also
possessed
the
heart
tentacle
but
when
he
sat
up
and
their
eyes
met
and
remained
in
sympathetic
contact
he
seemed
to
see
right
into
a
soul
that
was
the
home
of
love
warmth
kindness
tenderness
and
intimacy
such
was
the
noble
familiarity
of
that
gaze
that
he
thought
he
knew
her
after
that
he
recognised
all
the
loveliness
of
her
person
she
was
tall
and
slight
all
her
movements
were
as
graceful
as
music
her
skin
was
not
of
a
dead
opaque
colour
like
that
of
an
earth
beauty
but
was
opalescent
its
hue
was
continually
changing
with
every
thought
and
emotion
but
none
of
these
tints
was
were
delicate
and
poetic
she
had
very
long
loosely
plaited
flaxen
hair
the
new
organs
as
soon
as
maskull
had
familiarised
himself
with
them
imparted
something
to
her
face
that
was
unique
and
striking
he
could
not
quite
define
it
to
himself
but
subtlety
and
inwardness
seemed
added
the
organs
did
not
contradict
the
love
of
her
eyes
or
the
angelic
purity
of
her
features
but
nevertheless
sounded
a
deeper
note
that
saved
her
from
mere
girlishness
her
gaze
was
so
friendly
and
unembarrassed
that
maskull
felt
scarcely
any
humiliation
at
sitting
at
her
feet
naked
and
helpless
she
realised
his
plight
and
put
into
his
hands
a
garment
that
she
had
been
carrying
over
her
arm
it
was
similar
to
the
one
she
was
wearing
but
of
a
darker
more
masculine
colour
do
you
think
you
can
put
it
on
by
yourself
he
was
distinctly
conscious
of
these
words
yet
her
voice
had
not
sounded
he
forced
himself
up
to
his
feet
and
she
helped
him
to
master
the
complications
of
the
drapery
poor
you
are
suffering
she
said
in
the
same
inaudible
language
this
time
he
discovered
that
the
sense
of
what
she
said
was
received
by
his
brain
through
the
organ
on
his
forehead
where
am
i
is
this
tormance
he
asked
as
he
spoke
he
staggered
she
caught
him
and
helped
him
to
sit
down
yes
you
are
with
then
she
regarded
him
with
a
smile
and
began
speaking
aloud
in
english
her
voice
somehow
reminded
him
of
an
april
day
it
was
so
fresh
nervous
and
girlish
i
can
now
understand
your
language
it
was
strange
at
first
in
the
future
i
ll
speak
to
you
with
my
this
is
extraordinary
what
is
this
organ
he
asked
touching
his
forehead
it
is
named
the
by
means
of
it
we
read
one
another
s
thoughts
still
speech
is
better
for
then
the
heart
can
be
read
he
smiled
they
say
that
speech
is
given
us
to
deceive
one
can
deceive
with
thought
too
but
i
m
thinking
of
the
best
not
the
have
you
seen
my
friends
she
scrutinised
him
quietly
before
answering
did
you
not
come
alone
i
came
with
two
other
men
in
a
machine
i
must
have
lost
consciousness
on
arrival
and
i
haven
t
seen
them
that
s
very
strange
no
i
haven
t
seen
them
they
can
t
be
here
or
we
would
have
known
it
my
husband
and
what
is
your
name
and
your
husband
s
name
mine
is
husband
s
is
panawe
we
live
a
very
long
way
from
here
still
it
came
to
us
both
last
night
that
you
were
lying
here
insensible
we
almost
quarrelled
about
which
of
us
should
come
to
you
but
in
the
end
i
here
she
laughed
i
won
because
i
am
the
of
the
two
he
is
the
purer
in
thanks
joiwind
said
maskull
simply
the
colors
chased
each
other
rapidly
beneath
her
skin
oh
why
do
you
say
that
what
pleasure
is
greater
than
i
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
but
now
we
must
exchange
what
is
this
he
demanded
rather
puzzled
it
must
be
so
your
blood
is
far
too
thick
and
heavy
for
our
world
until
you
have
an
infusion
of
mine
you
will
never
get
maskull
flushed
i
feel
like
a
complete
ignoramus
here
won
t
it
hurt
you
if
your
blood
pains
you
i
suppose
it
will
pain
me
but
we
will
share
the
this
is
a
new
kind
of
hospitality
to
me
he
muttered
wouldn
t
you
do
the
same
for
me
asked
joiwind
half
smiling
half
agitated
i
can
t
answer
for
any
of
my
actions
in
this
world
i
scarcely
know
where
i
am
why
course
i
would
while
they
were
talking
it
had
become
full
day
the
mists
had
rolled
away
from
the
ground
and
only
the
upper
atmosphere
remained
charged
the
desert
of
scarlet
sand
stretched
in
all
directions
except
one
where
there
was
a
sort
of
little
low
hills
clothed
sparsely
with
little
purple
trees
from
base
to
summit
it
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
joiwind
had
brought
with
her
a
small
flint
knife
without
any
trace
of
nervousness
she
made
a
careful
deep
incision
on
her
upper
arm
maskull
expostulated
really
this
part
of
it
is
nothing
she
said
laughing
and
if
it
sacrifice
that
is
no
merit
is
there
in
that
come
arm
the
blood
was
streaming
down
her
arm
it
was
not
red
blood
but
a
milky
opalescent
fluid
not
that
one
said
maskull
shrinking
i
have
already
been
cut
he
submitted
the
other
and
his
blood
poured
forth
joiwind
delicately
and
skilfully
placed
the
mouths
of
the
two
wounds
together
and
then
kept
her
arm
pressed
tightly
against
maskull
s
for
a
long
time
he
felt
a
stream
of
pleasure
entering
his
body
through
the
incision
his
old
lightness
and
vigour
began
to
return
to
him
after
about
five
minutes
a
duel
of
kindness
started
between
them
he
wanted
to
remove
his
arm
and
she
to
continue
at
last
he
had
his
way
but
it
was
none
too
stood
there
pale
and
dispirited
she
looked
at
him
with
a
more
serious
expression
than
before
as
if
strange
depths
had
opened
up
before
her
eyes
what
is
your
name
where
have
you
come
from
with
this
awful
blood
from
a
world
called
earth
the
blood
is
clearly
unsuitable
for
this
world
joiwind
but
after
all
that
was
only
to
be
expected
i
am
sorry
i
let
you
have
your
oh
don
t
say
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
we
must
all
help
one
another
yet
feel
and
well
you
may
for
it
s
a
fearful
thing
for
a
girl
to
accept
in
her
own
veins
the
blood
of
a
strange
man
from
a
strange
planet
if
i
had
not
been
so
dazed
and
weak
i
would
never
have
allowed
but
i
would
have
insisted
are
we
not
all
brothers
and
sisters
why
did
you
come
here
maskull
he
was
conscious
of
a
slight
degree
of
embarrassment
will
you
think
it
foolish
if
i
say
i
hardly
know
came
with
those
two
men
perhaps
i
was
attracted
by
curiosity
or
perhaps
it
was
the
love
of
perhaps
said
joiwind
i
wonder
these
friends
of
yours
must
be
terrible
men
why
did
they
come
that
i
can
tell
you
they
came
to
follow
her
face
grew
troubled
i
don
t
understand
it
one
of
them
at
least
must
be
a
bad
man
and
yet
if
he
is
following
shaping
as
he
is
called
can
t
be
really
what
do
you
know
of
surtur
asked
maskull
in
astonishment
joiwind
remained
silent
for
a
time
studying
his
face
his
brain
moved
restlessly
as
though
it
were
being
probed
from
outside
i
see
and
yet
i
don
t
see
she
said
at
last
it
is
very
difficult
your
god
is
a
dreadful
unfriendly
invisible
here
we
don
t
worship
a
god
like
that
tell
me
has
any
man
set
eyes
on
your
god
what
does
all
this
mean
joiwind
why
speak
of
god
i
want
to
in
ancient
times
when
the
earth
was
young
and
grand
a
few
holy
men
are
reputed
to
have
walked
and
spoken
with
god
but
those
days
are
our
world
is
still
young
said
joiwind
shaping
goes
among
us
and
converses
with
us
he
is
real
and
friend
and
lover
shaping
made
us
and
he
loves
his
have
you
met
him
demanded
maskull
hardly
believing
his
ears
no
i
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
yet
some
day
i
may
have
an
opportunity
to
sacrifice
myself
and
then
i
may
be
rewarded
by
meeting
and
talking
with
i
have
certainly
come
to
another
world
but
why
do
you
say
he
is
the
same
as
surtur
yes
he
is
the
same
we
women
call
him
shaping
and
so
do
most
men
but
a
few
name
him
maskull
bit
his
nail
have
you
ever
heard
of
crystalman
that
is
shaping
once
again
you
see
he
has
many
shows
how
much
he
occupies
our
minds
crystalman
is
a
name
of
it
s
odd
said
maskull
i
came
here
with
quite
different
ideas
about
joiwind
shook
her
hair
in
that
grove
of
trees
over
there
stands
a
desert
shrine
of
his
let
us
go
and
pray
there
and
then
we
ll
go
on
our
way
to
poolingdred
that
is
my
home
it
s
a
long
way
off
and
we
must
get
there
before
now
what
is
blodsombre
for
about
four
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
branchspell
s
rays
are
so
hot
that
no
one
can
endure
them
we
call
it
is
branchspell
another
name
for
arcturus
joiwind
threw
off
her
seriousness
and
laughed
naturally
we
don
t
take
our
names
from
you
maskull
i
don
t
think
our
names
are
very
poetic
but
they
follow
she
took
his
arm
affectionately
and
directed
their
walk
towards
the
hills
as
they
went
along
the
sun
broke
through
the
upper
mists
and
a
terrible
gust
of
scorching
heat
like
a
blast
from
a
furnace
struck
maskull
s
head
he
involuntarily
looked
up
but
lowered
his
eyes
again
like
lightning
all
that
he
saw
in
that
instant
was
a
glaring
ball
of
electric
white
three
times
the
apparent
diameter
of
the
sun
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
quite
blind
my
god
he
exclaimed
if
it
s
like
this
in
early
morning
you
must
be
right
enough
about
when
he
had
somewhat
recovered
himself
he
asked
how
long
are
the
days
here
joiwind
again
he
felt
his
brain
being
probed
at
this
time
of
the
year
for
every
hour
s
daylight
that
you
have
in
summer
we
have
the
heat
is
yet
somehow
i
don
t
feel
so
distressed
by
it
as
i
would
have
i
feel
it
more
than
usual
it
s
not
difficult
to
account
for
it
you
have
some
of
my
blood
and
i
have
some
of
yes
every
time
i
realise
that
me
joiwind
will
my
blood
alter
if
i
stay
here
long
enough
mean
will
it
lose
its
redness
and
thickness
and
become
pure
and
thin
and
like
yours
why
not
if
you
live
as
we
live
you
will
assuredly
grow
like
do
you
mean
food
and
drink
we
eat
no
food
and
drink
only
and
on
that
you
manage
to
sustain
life
well
maskull
our
water
is
good
water
replied
joiwind
smiling
as
soon
as
he
could
see
again
he
stared
around
at
the
landscape
the
enormous
scarlet
desert
extended
everywhere
to
the
horizon
excepting
where
it
was
broken
by
the
oasis
it
was
roofed
by
a
cloudless
deep
blue
almost
violet
sky
the
circle
of
the
horizon
was
far
larger
than
on
earth
on
the
skyline
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
in
which
they
were
walking
appeared
a
chain
of
mountains
apparently
about
forty
miles
distant
one
which
was
higher
than
the
rest
was
shaped
like
a
cup
maskull
would
have
felt
inclined
to
believe
he
was
travelling
in
dreamland
but
for
the
intensity
of
the
light
which
made
everything
vividly
real
joiwind
pointed
to
the
mountain
that
s
you
didn
t
come
from
there
he
exclaimed
quite
startled
yes
i
did
indeed
and
that
is
where
we
have
to
go
to
with
the
single
object
of
finding
me
why
the
colour
mounted
to
his
face
then
you
are
the
bravest
and
noblest
of
all
girls
he
said
quietly
after
a
pause
without
exception
why
this
is
a
journey
for
an
athlete
she
pressed
his
arm
while
a
score
of
unpaintable
delicate
hues
stained
her
cheeks
in
rapid
transition
please
don
t
say
any
more
about
it
maskull
it
makes
me
feel
very
well
but
can
we
possibly
get
there
before
midday
oh
yes
and
you
mustn
t
be
frightened
at
the
distance
we
think
nothing
of
long
distances
have
so
much
to
think
about
and
feel
time
goes
all
too
during
their
conversation
they
had
drawn
near
the
base
of
the
hills
which
sloped
gently
and
were
not
above
fifty
feet
in
height
maskull
now
began
to
see
strange
specimens
of
vegetable
life
what
looked
like
a
small
patch
of
purple
grass
above
five
feet
square
was
moving
across
the
sand
in
their
direction
when
it
came
near
enough
he
perceived
that
it
was
not
grass
there
were
no
blades
but
only
purple
roots
the
roots
were
revolving
for
each
small
plant
in
the
whole
patch
like
the
spokes
of
a
rimless
wheel
they
were
alternately
plunged
in
the
sand
and
withdrawn
from
it
and
by
this
means
the
plant
proceeded
forward
some
uncanny
instinct
was
keeping
all
the
plants
together
moving
at
one
pace
in
one
direction
like
a
flock
of
migrating
birds
in
flight
another
remarkable
plant
was
a
large
feathery
ball
resembling
a
dandelion
fruit
which
they
encountered
sailing
through
the
air
joiwind
caught
it
with
an
exceedingly
graceful
movement
of
her
arm
and
showed
it
to
maskull
it
had
roots
and
presumably
lived
in
the
air
and
fed
on
the
chemical
constituents
of
the
atmosphere
but
what
was
peculiar
about
it
was
its
colour
it
was
an
entirely
new
a
new
shade
or
combination
but
a
new
primary
colour
as
vivid
as
blue
red
or
yellow
but
quite
different
when
he
inquired
she
told
him
that
it
was
known
as
presently
he
met
with
a
second
new
colour
this
she
designated
the
sense
impressions
caused
in
maskull
by
these
two
additional
primary
colors
can
only
be
vaguely
hinted
at
by
analogy
just
as
blue
is
delicate
and
mysterious
yellow
clear
and
unsubtle
and
red
sanguine
and
passionate
so
he
felt
ulfire
to
be
wild
and
painful
and
jale
dreamlike
feverish
and
voluptuous
the
hills
were
composed
of
a
rich
dark
mould
small
trees
of
weird
shapes
all
differing
from
each
other
but
all
covered
the
slopes
and
top
maskull
and
joiwind
climbed
up
and
through
some
hard
fruit
bright
blue
in
colour
of
the
size
of
a
large
apple
and
shaped
like
an
egg
was
lying
in
profusion
underneath
the
trees
is
the
fruit
here
poisonous
or
why
don
t
you
eat
it
asked
maskull
she
looked
at
him
tranquilly
we
don
t
eat
living
things
the
thought
is
horrible
to
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
that
theoretically
but
do
you
really
sustain
your
bodies
on
water
supposing
you
could
find
nothing
else
to
live
on
you
eat
other
men
i
would
neither
will
we
eat
plants
and
animals
which
are
our
fellow
creatures
so
nothing
is
left
to
us
but
water
and
as
one
can
really
live
on
anything
water
does
very
maskull
picked
up
one
of
the
fruits
and
handled
it
curiously
as
he
did
so
another
of
his
newly
acquired
sense
organs
came
into
action
he
found
that
the
fleshy
knobs
beneath
his
ears
were
in
some
novel
fashion
acquainting
him
with
the
inward
properties
of
the
fruit
he
could
not
only
see
feel
and
smell
it
but
could
detect
its
intrinsic
nature
this
nature
was
hard
persistent
and
melancholy
joiwind
answered
the
questions
he
had
not
asked
those
organs
are
called
their
use
is
to
enable
us
to
understand
and
sympathise
with
all
living
what
advantage
do
you
derive
from
that
joiwind
the
advantage
of
not
being
cruel
and
selfish
dear
he
threw
the
fruit
away
and
flushed
again
joiwind
looked
into
his
swarthy
bearded
face
without
embarrassment
and
slowly
smiled
have
i
said
too
much
have
i
been
too
familiar
do
you
know
why
you
think
so
it
s
because
you
are
still
impure
by
and
by
you
will
listen
to
all
language
without
before
he
realised
what
she
was
about
to
do
she
threw
her
tentacle
round
his
neck
like
another
arm
he
offered
no
resistance
to
its
cool
pressure
the
contact
of
her
soft
flesh
with
his
own
was
so
moist
and
sensitive
that
it
resembled
another
kind
of
kiss
he
saw
who
it
was
that
embraced
pale
beautiful
girl
yet
oddly
enough
he
experienced
neither
voluptuousness
nor
sexual
pride
the
love
expressed
by
the
caress
was
rich
glowing
and
personal
but
there
was
not
the
least
trace
of
sex
in
so
he
received
it
she
removed
her
tentacle
placed
her
two
arms
on
his
shoulders
and
penetrated
with
her
eyes
right
into
his
very
soul
yes
i
wish
to
be
pure
he
muttered
without
that
what
can
i
ever
be
but
a
weak
squirming
devil
joiwind
released
him
this
we
call
the
magn
she
said
indicating
her
tentacle
by
means
of
it
what
we
love
already
we
love
more
and
what
we
don
t
love
at
all
we
begin
to
a
godlike
organ
it
is
the
one
we
guard
most
jealously
said
joiwind
the
shade
of
the
trees
afforded
a
timely
screen
from
the
now
almost
insufferable
rays
of
branchspell
which
was
climbing
steadily
upward
to
the
zenith
on
descending
the
other
side
of
the
little
hills
maskull
looked
anxiously
for
traces
of
nightspore
and
krag
but
without
result
after
staring
about
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
suspicions
had
already
begun
to
gather
in
his
mind
a
small
natural
amphitheatre
lay
at
their
feet
completely
circled
by
the
heights
the
centre
was
of
red
sand
in
the
very
middle
shot
up
a
tall
stately
tree
with
a
black
trunk
and
branches
and
transparent
crystal
leaves
at
the
foot
of
this
tree
was
a
natural
circular
well
containing
dark
green
water
when
they
had
reached
the
bottom
joiwind
took
him
straight
over
to
the
well
maskull
gazed
at
it
intently
is
this
the
shrine
you
talked
about
yes
it
is
called
shaping
s
well
the
man
or
woman
who
wishes
to
invoke
shaping
must
take
up
some
of
the
gnawl
water
and
drink
pray
for
me
said
maskull
your
unspotted
prayer
will
carry
more
what
do
you
wish
for
for
purity
answered
maskull
in
a
troubled
voice
joiwind
made
a
cup
of
her
hand
and
drank
a
little
of
the
water
she
held
it
up
to
maskull
s
mouth
you
must
drink
he
obeyed
she
then
stood
erect
closed
her
eyes
and
in
a
voice
like
the
soft
murmurings
of
spring
prayed
aloud
shaping
my
father
i
am
hoping
you
can
hear
me
a
strange
man
has
come
to
us
weighed
down
with
heavy
blood
he
wishes
to
be
pure
let
him
know
the
meaning
of
love
let
him
live
for
others
don
t
spare
him
pain
dear
shaping
but
let
him
seek
his
own
pain
breathe
into
him
a
noble
maskull
listened
with
tears
in
his
heart
as
joiwind
finished
speaking
a
blurred
mist
came
over
his
eyes
and
half
buried
in
the
scarlet
sand
appeared
a
large
circle
of
dazzlingly
white
pillars
for
some
minutes
they
flickered
to
and
fro
between
distinctness
and
indistinctness
like
an
object
being
focused
then
they
faded
out
of
sight
again
is
that
a
sign
from
shaping
asked
maskull
in
a
low
awed
tone
perhaps
it
is
it
is
a
time
what
can
that
be
joiwind
you
see
dear
maskull
the
temple
does
not
yet
exist
but
it
will
do
so
because
it
must
what
you
and
i
are
now
doing
in
simplicity
wise
men
will
do
hereafter
in
full
it
is
right
for
man
to
pray
said
maskull
good
and
evil
in
the
world
don
t
originate
from
nothing
god
and
devil
must
exist
and
we
should
pray
to
the
one
and
fight
the
yes
we
must
fight
what
name
did
you
say
asked
maskull
in
amazement
author
of
evil
and
you
call
he
immediately
concealed
his
thoughts
to
prevent
joiwind
from
learning
his
relationship
to
this
being
he
made
his
mind
a
blank
why
do
you
hide
your
mind
from
me
she
demanded
looking
at
him
strangely
and
changing
colour
in
this
bright
pure
radiant
world
evil
seems
so
remote
one
can
scarcely
grasp
its
but
he
lied
joiwind
continued
gazing
at
him
straight
out
of
her
clean
soul
the
world
is
good
and
pure
but
many
men
are
corrupt
panawe
my
husband
has
travelled
and
he
has
told
me
things
i
would
almost
rather
have
not
heard
one
person
he
met
believed
the
universe
to
be
from
top
to
bottom
a
conjurer
s
i
should
like
to
meet
your
well
we
are
going
home
maskull
was
on
the
point
of
inquiring
whether
she
had
any
children
but
was
afraid
of
offending
her
and
checked
himself
she
read
the
mental
question
what
need
is
there
is
not
the
whole
world
full
of
lovely
children
why
should
i
want
selfish
possessions
an
extraordinary
creature
flew
past
uttering
a
plaintive
cry
of
five
distinct
notes
it
was
not
a
bird
but
had
a
body
paddled
by
five
webbed
feet
it
disappeared
among
the
trees
joiwind
pointed
to
it
as
it
went
by
i
love
that
beast
grotesque
as
it
all
the
more
for
its
grotesqueness
but
if
i
had
children
of
my
own
would
i
still
love
it
which
is
love
two
or
three
or
to
love
all
every
woman
can
t
be
like
you
joiwind
but
it
is
good
to
have
a
few
like
you
wouldn
t
it
be
as
well
he
went
on
since
we
ve
got
to
walk
through
that
wilderness
to
make
turbans
for
our
heads
out
of
some
of
those
long
leaves
she
smiled
rather
pathetically
you
will
think
me
foolish
but
every
tearing
off
of
a
leaf
would
be
a
wound
in
my
heart
we
have
only
to
throw
our
robes
over
our
no
doubt
that
will
answer
the
same
purpose
but
tell
t
these
very
robes
once
part
of
a
living
creature
oh
they
are
the
webs
of
a
certain
animal
but
they
have
never
been
in
themselves
you
reduce
life
to
extreme
simplicity
remarked
maskull
meditatively
but
it
is
very
climbing
back
over
the
hills
they
now
without
further
ceremony
began
their
march
across
the
desert
they
walked
side
by
side
joiwind
directed
their
course
straight
toward
poolingdred
from
the
position
of
the
sun
maskull
judged
their
way
to
lie
due
north
the
sand
was
soft
and
powdery
very
tiring
to
his
naked
feet
the
red
glare
dazed
his
eyes
and
made
him
he
was
hot
parched
and
tormented
with
the
craving
to
drink
his
undertone
of
pain
emerged
into
full
consciousness
i
see
my
friends
nowhere
and
it
is
very
yes
it
is
it
is
accidental
said
joiwind
with
a
peculiar
intonation
exactly
agreed
maskull
if
they
had
met
with
a
mishap
their
bodies
would
still
be
there
it
begins
to
look
like
a
piece
of
bad
work
to
me
they
must
have
gone
on
and
left
me
well
i
am
here
and
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
will
trouble
no
more
about
i
don
t
wish
to
speak
ill
of
anyone
said
joiwind
but
my
instinct
tells
me
that
you
are
better
away
from
those
men
they
did
not
come
here
for
your
sake
but
for
their
they
walked
on
for
a
long
time
maskull
was
beginning
to
feel
faint
she
twined
her
magn
lovingly
around
his
waist
and
a
strong
current
of
confidence
and
instantly
coursed
through
his
veins
thanks
joiwind
but
am
i
not
weakening
you
yes
she
replied
with
a
quick
thrilling
glance
but
not
it
gives
me
great
presently
they
met
a
fantastic
little
creature
the
size
of
a
lamb
waltzing
along
on
three
legs
each
leg
in
turn
moved
to
the
front
and
so
the
little
monstrosity
proceeded
by
means
of
a
series
of
complete
rotations
it
was
vividly
coloured
as
though
it
had
been
dipped
into
pots
of
bright
blue
and
yellow
paint
it
looked
up
with
small
shining
eyes
as
they
passed
joiwind
nodded
and
smiled
to
it
that
s
a
personal
friend
of
mine
maskull
whenever
i
come
this
way
i
see
it
it
s
always
waltzing
and
always
in
a
hurry
but
it
never
seems
to
get
it
seems
to
me
that
life
is
so
here
that
there
is
no
need
for
anyone
to
get
anywhere
what
i
don
t
quite
understand
is
how
you
manage
to
pass
your
days
without
that
s
a
strange
word
it
means
does
it
not
craving
for
excitement
something
of
the
kind
said
maskull
that
must
be
a
disease
brought
on
by
rich
but
are
you
never
dull
how
could
we
be
our
blood
is
quick
and
light
and
free
our
flesh
is
clean
and
unclogged
inside
and
out
before
long
i
hope
you
will
understand
what
sort
of
question
you
have
farther
on
they
encountered
a
strange
phenomenon
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
a
fountain
rose
perpendicularly
fifty
feet
into
the
air
with
a
cool
and
pleasant
hissing
sound
it
differed
however
from
a
fountain
in
this
the
water
of
which
it
was
composed
did
not
return
to
the
ground
but
was
absorbed
by
the
atmosphere
at
the
summit
it
was
in
fact
a
tall
graceful
column
of
dark
green
fluid
with
a
capital
of
coiling
and
twisting
vapours
when
they
came
closer
maskull
perceived
that
this
water
column
was
the
continuation
and
termination
of
a
flowing
brook
which
came
down
from
the
direction
of
the
mountains
the
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
was
evidently
that
the
water
at
this
spot
found
chemical
affinities
in
the
upper
air
and
consequently
forsook
the
ground
now
let
us
drink
said
joiwind
she
threw
herself
unaffectedly
at
full
length
on
the
sand
face
downward
by
the
side
of
the
brook
and
maskull
was
not
long
in
following
her
example
she
refused
to
quench
her
thirst
until
she
had
seen
him
drink
he
found
the
water
heavy
but
bubbling
with
gas
he
drank
copiously
it
affected
his
palate
in
a
new
the
purity
and
cleanness
of
water
was
combined
the
exhilaration
of
a
sparkling
wine
raising
his
somehow
the
intoxication
brought
out
his
better
nature
and
not
his
lower
we
call
it
gnawl
water
said
joiwind
this
is
not
quite
pure
as
you
can
see
by
the
colour
at
poolingdred
it
is
crystal
clear
but
we
would
be
ungrateful
if
we
complained
after
this
you
ll
find
we
ll
get
along
much
maskull
now
began
to
realise
his
environment
as
it
were
for
the
first
time
all
his
sense
organs
started
to
show
him
beauties
and
wonders
that
he
had
not
hitherto
suspected
the
uniform
glaring
scarlet
of
the
sands
became
separated
into
a
score
of
clearly
distinguished
shades
of
red
the
sky
was
similarly
split
up
into
different
blues
the
radiant
heat
of
branchspell
he
found
to
affect
every
part
of
his
body
with
unequal
intensities
his
ears
awakened
the
atmosphere
was
full
of
murmurs
the
sands
hummed
even
the
sun
s
rays
had
a
sound
of
their
kind
of
faint
aeolian
harp
subtle
puzzling
perfumes
assailed
his
nostrils
his
palate
lingered
over
the
memory
of
the
gnawl
water
all
the
pores
of
his
skin
were
tickled
and
soothed
by
hitherto
unperceived
currents
of
air
his
poigns
explored
actively
the
inward
nature
of
everything
in
his
immediate
vicinity
his
magn
touched
joiwind
and
drew
from
her
person
a
stream
of
love
and
joy
and
lastly
by
means
of
his
breve
he
exchanged
thoughts
with
her
in
silence
this
mighty
sense
symphony
stirred
him
to
the
depths
and
throughout
the
walk
of
that
endless
morning
he
felt
no
more
fatigue
when
it
was
drawing
near
to
blodsombre
they
approached
the
sedgy
margin
of
a
dark
green
lake
which
lay
underneath
poolingdred
panawe
was
sitting
on
a
dark
rock
waiting
for
them
chapter
panawe
the
husband
got
up
to
meet
his
wife
and
their
guest
he
was
clothed
in
white
he
had
a
beardless
face
with
breve
and
poigns
his
skin
on
face
and
body
alike
was
so
white
fresh
and
soft
that
it
scarcely
looked
skin
at
rather
resembled
a
new
kind
of
pure
snowy
flesh
extending
right
down
to
his
bones
it
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
artificially
whitened
skin
of
an
woman
its
whiteness
and
delicacy
aroused
no
voluptuous
thoughts
it
was
obviously
the
manifestation
of
a
cold
and
almost
cruel
chastity
of
nature
his
hair
which
fell
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
also
was
white
but
again
from
vigour
not
decay
his
eyes
were
black
quiet
and
fathomless
he
was
still
a
young
man
but
so
stern
were
his
features
that
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
lawgiver
and
this
in
spite
of
their
great
beauty
and
harmony
his
magn
and
joiwind
s
intertwined
for
a
single
moment
and
maskull
saw
his
face
soften
with
love
while
she
looked
exultant
she
put
him
in
her
husband
s
arms
with
gentle
force
and
stood
back
gazing
and
smiling
maskull
felt
rather
embarrassed
at
being
embraced
by
a
man
but
submitted
to
it
a
sense
of
cool
pleasant
languor
passed
through
him
in
the
act
the
stranger
is
then
he
was
startled
by
panawe
s
speaking
in
english
and
the
voice
too
was
extraordinary
it
was
absolutely
tranquil
but
its
tranquillity
seemed
in
a
curious
fashion
to
be
an
illusion
proceeding
from
a
rapidity
of
thoughts
and
feelings
so
great
that
their
motion
could
not
be
detected
how
this
could
be
he
did
not
know
how
do
you
come
to
speak
in
a
tongue
you
have
never
heard
before
demanded
maskull
thought
is
a
rich
complex
thing
i
can
t
say
if
i
am
really
speaking
your
tongue
by
instinct
or
if
you
yourself
are
translating
my
thoughts
into
your
tongue
as
i
utter
already
you
see
that
panawe
is
wiser
than
i
am
said
joiwind
gaily
what
is
your
name
asked
the
husband
that
name
must
have
a
again
thought
is
a
strange
thing
i
connect
that
name
with
with
what
try
to
discover
said
joiwind
has
there
been
a
man
in
your
world
who
stole
something
from
the
maker
of
the
universe
in
order
to
ennoble
his
fellow
creatures
there
is
such
a
myth
the
hero
s
name
was
well
you
seem
to
be
identified
in
my
mind
with
that
what
it
all
means
i
can
t
say
accept
it
as
a
good
omen
for
panawe
never
lies
and
never
speaks
there
must
be
some
confusion
these
are
heights
beyond
me
said
maskull
calmly
but
looking
rather
contemplative
where
do
you
come
from
from
the
planet
of
a
distant
sun
called
what
for
i
was
tired
of
vulgarity
returned
maskull
laconically
he
intentionally
avoided
mentioning
his
fellow
voyagers
in
order
that
krag
s
name
should
not
come
to
light
that
s
an
honourable
motive
said
panawe
and
what
s
more
it
may
be
true
though
you
spoke
it
as
a
as
far
as
it
goes
it
s
quite
true
said
maskull
staring
at
him
with
annoyance
and
surprise
the
swampy
lake
extended
for
about
half
a
mile
from
where
they
were
standing
to
the
lower
buttresses
of
the
mountain
feathery
purple
reeds
showed
themselves
here
and
there
through
the
shallows
the
water
was
dark
green
maskull
did
not
see
how
they
were
going
to
cross
it
joiwind
caught
his
arm
perhaps
you
don
t
know
that
the
lake
will
bear
us
panawe
walked
onto
the
water
it
was
so
heavy
that
it
carried
his
weight
joiwind
followed
with
maskull
he
instantly
started
to
slip
the
motion
was
amusing
and
he
learned
so
fast
by
watching
and
imitating
panawe
that
he
was
soon
able
to
balance
himself
without
assistance
after
that
he
found
the
sport
excellent
for
the
same
reason
that
women
excel
in
dancing
joiwind
s
half
falls
and
recoveries
were
far
more
graceful
and
sure
than
those
of
either
of
the
men
her
slight
draped
bending
rising
swaying
twisting
upon
the
surface
of
the
dark
was
a
picture
maskull
could
not
keep
his
eyes
away
from
the
lake
grew
deeper
the
gnawl
water
became
the
crags
gullies
and
precipices
of
the
shore
could
now
be
distinguished
in
detail
a
waterfall
was
visible
descending
several
hundred
feet
the
surface
of
the
lake
grew
much
so
that
maskull
had
difficulty
in
keeping
his
balance
he
therefore
threw
himself
down
and
started
swimming
on
the
face
of
the
water
joiwind
turned
her
head
and
laughed
so
joyously
that
all
her
teeth
flashed
in
the
sunlight
they
landed
in
a
few
more
minutes
on
a
promontory
of
black
rock
the
water
on
maskull
s
garment
and
body
evaporated
very
quickly
he
gazed
upward
at
the
towering
mountain
but
at
that
moment
some
strange
movements
on
the
part
of
panawe
attracted
his
attention
his
face
was
working
convulsively
and
he
began
to
stagger
about
then
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
took
from
it
what
looked
like
a
pebble
he
looked
at
it
carefully
for
some
seconds
joiwind
also
looked
over
his
shoulder
with
quickly
changing
colors
after
this
inspection
panawe
let
the
it
to
the
ground
and
took
no
more
interest
in
it
may
i
look
asked
maskull
and
without
waiting
for
permission
he
picked
it
up
it
was
a
delicately
beautiful
crystal
of
pale
green
where
did
this
come
from
he
asked
queerly
panawe
turned
away
but
joiwind
answered
for
him
it
came
out
of
my
that
s
what
i
thought
but
i
couldn
t
believe
it
but
what
is
it
i
don
t
know
that
it
has
either
name
or
use
it
is
merely
an
overflowing
of
beauty
joiwind
smiled
if
you
were
to
regard
nature
as
the
husband
and
panawe
as
the
wife
maskull
perhaps
everything
would
be
maskull
reflected
on
earth
he
said
after
a
minute
men
like
panawe
are
called
artists
poets
and
musicians
beauty
overflows
into
them
too
and
out
of
them
again
the
only
distinction
is
that
their
productions
are
more
human
and
nothing
comes
from
it
but
vanity
said
panawe
and
taking
the
crystal
out
of
maskull
s
hand
he
threw
it
into
the
lake
the
precipice
they
now
had
to
climb
was
several
hundred
feet
in
height
maskull
was
more
anxious
for
joiwind
than
for
himself
she
was
evidently
tiring
but
she
refused
all
help
and
was
in
fact
still
the
nimbler
of
the
two
she
made
a
mocking
face
at
him
panawe
seemed
lost
in
quiet
thoughts
the
rock
was
sound
and
did
not
crumble
under
their
weight
the
heat
of
branchspell
however
was
by
this
time
almost
killing
the
radiance
was
shocking
in
its
white
intensity
and
maskull
s
pain
steadily
grew
worse
when
they
got
to
the
top
a
plateau
of
dark
rock
appeared
bare
of
vegetation
stretching
in
both
directions
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
it
was
of
a
nearly
uniform
width
of
five
hundred
yards
from
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
to
the
lower
slopes
of
the
chain
of
hills
inland
the
hills
varied
in
height
the
poolingdred
was
approximately
a
thousand
feet
above
them
the
upper
part
of
it
was
covered
with
a
kind
of
glittering
vegetation
which
he
could
not
comprehend
joiwind
put
her
hand
on
maskull
s
shoulder
and
pointed
upward
here
you
have
the
highest
peak
in
the
whole
is
until
you
come
to
the
ifdawn
on
hearing
that
strange
name
he
experienced
a
momentary
unaccountable
sensation
of
wild
vigour
and
it
passed
away
without
losing
time
panawe
led
the
way
up
the
mountainside
the
lower
half
was
of
bare
rock
not
difficult
to
climb
halfway
up
however
it
grew
steeper
and
they
began
to
meet
bushes
and
small
trees
the
growth
became
thicker
as
they
continued
to
ascend
and
when
they
neared
the
summit
tall
forest
trees
appeared
these
bushes
and
trees
had
pale
glassy
trunks
and
branches
but
the
small
twigs
and
the
leaves
were
translucent
and
crystal
they
cast
no
shadows
from
above
but
still
the
shade
was
cool
both
leaves
and
branches
were
fantastically
shaped
what
surprised
maskull
the
most
however
was
the
fact
that
as
far
as
he
could
see
scarcely
any
two
plants
belonged
to
the
same
species
won
t
you
help
maskull
out
of
his
difficulty
said
joiwind
pulling
her
husband
s
arm
he
smiled
if
he
ll
forgive
me
for
again
trespassing
in
his
brain
but
the
difficulty
is
small
life
on
a
new
planet
maskull
is
necessarily
energetic
and
lawless
and
not
sedate
and
imitative
nature
is
still
yet
matter
is
plastic
the
will
forks
and
sports
incessantly
and
thus
no
two
creatures
are
well
i
understand
all
that
replied
maskull
after
listening
attentively
but
what
i
don
t
grasp
is
living
creatures
here
sport
so
energetically
how
does
it
come
about
that
human
beings
wear
much
the
same
shape
as
in
my
world
i
ll
explain
that
too
said
panawe
all
creatures
that
resemble
shaping
must
of
necessity
resemble
one
then
sporting
is
the
blind
will
to
become
like
shaping
it
is
most
wonderful
said
maskull
then
the
brotherhood
of
man
is
not
a
fable
invented
by
idealists
but
a
solid
joiwind
looked
at
him
and
changed
colour
panawe
relapsed
into
sternness
maskull
became
interested
in
a
new
phenomenon
the
blossoms
of
a
crystal
bush
were
emitting
mental
waves
which
with
his
breve
he
could
clearly
distinguish
they
cried
out
silently
to
me
to
me
while
he
looked
a
flying
worm
guided
itself
through
the
air
to
one
of
these
blossoms
and
began
to
suck
its
nectar
the
floral
cry
immediately
ceased
they
now
gained
the
crest
of
the
mountain
and
looked
down
beyond
a
lake
occupied
its
cavity
a
fringe
of
trees
partly
intercepted
the
view
but
maskull
was
able
to
perceive
that
this
mountain
lake
was
nearly
circular
and
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
its
shore
stood
a
hundred
feet
below
them
observing
that
his
hosts
did
not
propose
to
descend
he
begged
them
to
wait
for
him
and
scrambled
down
to
the
surface
when
he
got
there
he
found
the
water
perfectly
motionless
and
of
a
colourless
transparency
he
walked
onto
it
lay
down
at
full
length
and
peered
into
the
depths
it
was
weirdly
clear
he
could
see
down
for
an
indefinite
distance
without
arriving
at
any
bottom
some
dark
shadowy
objects
almost
out
of
reach
of
his
eyes
were
moving
about
then
a
sound
very
faint
and
mysterious
seemed
to
come
up
through
the
gnawl
water
from
an
immense
depth
it
was
like
the
rhythm
of
a
drum
there
were
four
beats
of
equal
length
but
the
accent
was
on
the
third
it
went
on
for
a
considerable
time
and
then
ceased
the
sound
appeared
to
him
to
belong
to
a
different
world
from
that
in
which
he
was
travelling
the
latter
was
mystical
dreamlike
and
drumming
was
like
a
very
dim
undertone
of
reality
it
resembled
the
ticking
of
a
clock
in
a
room
full
of
voices
only
occasionally
possible
to
be
picked
up
by
the
ear
he
rejoined
panawe
and
joiwind
but
said
nothing
to
them
about
his
experience
they
all
walked
round
the
rim
of
the
crater
and
gazed
down
on
the
opposite
side
precipices
similar
to
those
that
had
overlooked
the
desert
here
formed
the
boundary
of
a
vast
moorland
plain
whose
dimensions
could
not
be
measured
by
the
eye
it
was
solid
land
yet
he
could
not
make
out
its
prevailing
colour
it
was
as
if
made
of
transparent
glass
but
it
did
not
glitter
in
the
sunlight
no
objects
in
it
could
be
distinguished
except
a
rolling
river
in
the
far
distance
and
farther
off
still
on
the
horizon
a
line
of
dark
mountains
of
strange
shapes
instead
of
being
rounded
conical
or
hogbacked
these
heights
were
carved
by
nature
into
the
semblance
of
castle
battlements
but
with
extremely
deep
indentations
the
sky
immediately
above
the
mountains
was
of
a
vivid
intense
blue
it
contrasted
in
a
most
marvellous
way
with
the
blue
of
the
rest
of
the
heavens
it
seemed
more
luminous
and
radiant
and
was
in
fact
like
the
afterglow
of
a
gorgeous
blue
sunset
maskull
kept
on
looking
the
more
he
gazed
the
more
restless
and
noble
became
his
feelings
what
is
that
light
panawe
was
sterner
than
usual
while
his
wife
clung
to
his
arm
it
is
second
sun
he
replied
those
hills
are
the
ifdawn
marest
now
let
us
get
to
our
is
it
imagination
or
am
i
really
being
by
that
light
no
it
s
not
s
real
how
can
it
be
otherwise
when
two
suns
of
different
natures
are
drawing
you
at
the
same
time
luckily
you
are
not
looking
at
alppain
itself
it
s
invisible
here
you
would
need
to
go
at
least
as
far
as
ifdawn
to
set
eyes
on
why
do
you
say
luckily
because
the
agony
caused
by
those
opposing
forces
would
perhaps
be
more
than
you
could
bear
but
i
don
t
for
the
short
distance
that
remained
of
their
walk
maskull
was
very
thoughtful
and
uneasy
he
understood
nothing
whatever
object
his
eye
chanced
to
rest
on
changed
immediately
into
a
puzzle
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
mountain
peak
seemed
brooding
mysterious
and
waiting
panawe
gave
him
a
friendly
anxious
look
and
without
further
delay
led
the
way
down
a
little
track
which
traversed
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
terminated
in
the
mouth
of
a
cave
this
cave
was
the
home
of
panawe
and
joiwind
it
was
dark
inside
the
host
took
a
shell
and
filling
it
with
liquid
from
a
well
carelessly
sprinkled
the
sandy
floor
of
the
interior
a
greenish
phosphorescent
light
gradually
spread
to
the
furthest
limits
of
the
cavern
and
continued
to
illuminate
it
for
the
whole
time
they
were
there
there
was
no
furniture
some
dried
fernlike
leaves
served
for
couches
the
moment
she
got
in
joiwind
fell
down
in
exhaustion
her
husband
tended
her
with
calm
concern
he
bathed
her
face
put
drink
to
her
lips
energised
her
with
his
magn
and
finally
laid
her
down
to
sleep
at
the
sight
of
the
noble
woman
thus
suffering
on
his
account
maskull
was
distressed
panawe
however
endeavoured
to
reassure
him
it
s
quite
true
this
has
been
a
very
long
hard
double
journey
but
for
the
future
it
will
lighten
all
her
other
journeys
for
her
such
is
the
nature
of
i
can
t
conceive
how
i
have
walked
so
far
in
a
morning
said
maskull
and
she
has
been
twice
the
love
flows
in
her
veins
instead
of
blood
and
that
s
why
she
is
so
you
know
she
gave
me
some
of
it
otherwise
you
couldn
t
even
have
i
shall
never
forget
the
languorous
heat
of
the
day
outside
the
bright
mouth
of
the
cavern
the
cool
seclusion
of
the
interior
with
its
pale
green
glow
invited
maskull
to
sleep
but
curiosity
got
the
better
of
his
lassitude
will
it
disturb
her
if
we
talk
but
how
do
you
feel
i
require
little
sleep
in
any
case
it
s
more
important
that
you
should
hear
something
about
your
new
life
it
s
not
all
as
innocent
and
idyllic
as
this
if
you
intend
to
go
through
you
ought
to
be
instructed
about
the
oh
i
guessed
as
much
but
how
shall
we
i
put
questions
or
will
you
tell
me
what
you
think
is
most
essential
panawe
motioned
to
maskull
to
sit
down
on
a
pile
of
ferns
and
at
the
same
time
reclined
himself
leaning
on
one
arm
with
outstretched
legs
i
will
tell
some
incidents
of
my
life
you
will
begin
to
learn
from
them
what
sort
of
place
you
have
come
i
shall
be
grateful
said
maskull
preparing
himself
to
listen
panawe
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
started
his
narrative
in
tranquil
measured
yet
sympathetic
tones
panawe
s
story
my
earliest
recollection
is
of
being
taken
when
three
years
old
that
s
equivalent
to
fifteen
of
your
years
but
we
develop
more
slowly
here
by
my
father
and
mother
to
see
broodviol
the
wisest
man
in
tormance
he
dwelt
in
the
great
wombflash
forest
we
walked
through
trees
for
three
days
sleeping
at
night
the
trees
grew
taller
as
we
went
along
until
the
tops
were
out
of
sight
the
trunks
were
of
a
dark
red
colour
and
the
leaves
were
of
pale
ulfire
my
father
kept
stopping
to
think
if
left
uninterrupted
he
would
remain
for
half
a
day
in
deep
abstraction
my
mother
came
out
of
poolingdred
and
was
of
a
different
stamp
she
was
beautiful
generous
and
also
active
she
kept
urging
him
on
this
led
to
many
disputes
between
them
which
made
me
miserable
on
the
fourth
day
we
passed
through
a
part
of
the
forest
which
bordered
on
the
sinking
sea
this
sea
is
full
of
pouches
of
water
that
will
not
bear
a
man
s
weight
and
as
these
light
parts
don
t
differ
in
appearance
from
the
rest
it
is
dangerous
to
cross
my
father
pointed
out
a
dim
outline
on
the
horizon
and
told
me
it
was
swaylone
s
island
men
sometimes
go
there
but
none
ever
return
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
we
found
broodviol
standing
in
a
deep
miry
pit
in
the
forest
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
trees
three
hundred
feet
high
he
was
a
big
gnarled
rugged
wrinkled
sturdy
old
man
his
age
at
that
time
was
a
hundred
and
twenty
of
our
years
or
nearly
six
hundred
of
yours
his
body
was
trilateral
he
had
three
legs
three
arms
and
six
eyes
placed
at
equal
distances
all
around
his
head
this
gave
him
an
aspect
of
great
watchfulness
and
sagacity
he
was
standing
in
a
sort
of
trance
i
afterward
heard
this
saying
of
his
to
lie
is
to
sleep
to
sit
is
to
dream
to
stand
is
to
my
father
caught
the
infection
and
fell
into
meditation
but
my
mother
roused
them
both
thoroughly
broodviol
scowled
at
her
savagely
and
demanded
what
she
required
then
i
too
learned
for
the
first
time
the
object
of
our
journey
i
was
a
is
to
say
i
was
without
sex
my
parents
were
troubled
over
this
and
wished
to
consult
the
wisest
of
men
old
broodviol
smoothed
his
face
and
said
this
perhaps
will
not
be
so
difficult
i
will
explain
the
marvel
every
man
and
woman
among
us
is
a
walking
murderer
if
a
male
he
has
struggled
with
and
killed
the
female
who
was
born
in
the
same
body
with
a
female
she
has
killed
the
male
but
in
this
child
the
struggle
is
still
how
shall
we
end
it
asked
my
mother
let
the
child
direct
its
will
to
the
scene
of
the
combat
and
it
will
be
of
whichever
sex
it
you
want
of
course
to
be
a
man
don
t
you
said
my
mother
to
me
earnestly
then
i
shall
be
slaying
your
daughter
and
that
would
be
a
something
in
my
tone
attracted
broodviol
s
notice
that
was
spoken
not
selfishly
but
magnanimously
therefore
the
male
must
have
spoken
it
and
you
need
not
trouble
further
before
you
arrive
home
the
child
will
be
a
my
father
walked
away
out
of
sight
my
mother
bent
very
low
before
broodviol
for
about
ten
minutes
and
he
remained
all
that
time
looking
kindly
at
her
i
heard
that
shortly
afterward
alppain
came
into
that
land
for
a
few
hours
daily
broodviol
grew
melancholy
and
died
his
prophecy
came
we
reached
home
i
knew
the
meaning
of
shame
but
i
have
often
pondered
over
his
words
since
in
later
years
when
trying
to
understand
my
own
nature
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
wisest
of
men
as
he
was
he
still
did
not
see
quite
straight
on
this
occasion
between
me
and
my
twin
sister
enclosed
in
one
body
there
never
was
any
struggle
but
instinctive
reverence
for
life
withheld
both
of
us
from
fighting
for
existence
hers
was
the
stronger
temperament
and
she
sacrificed
not
me
as
soon
as
i
comprehended
this
i
made
a
vow
never
to
eat
or
destroy
anything
that
contained
i
have
kept
it
ever
since
while
i
was
still
hardly
a
grown
man
my
father
died
my
mother
s
death
followed
immediately
and
i
hated
the
associations
of
the
land
i
therefore
made
up
my
mind
to
travel
into
my
mother
s
country
where
as
she
had
often
told
me
nature
was
most
sacred
and
solitary
one
hot
morning
i
came
to
shaping
s
causeway
it
is
so
called
either
because
shaping
once
crossed
it
or
because
of
its
stupendous
character
it
is
a
natural
embankment
twenty
miles
long
which
links
the
mountains
bordering
my
homeland
with
the
ifdawn
marest
the
valley
lies
below
at
a
depth
varying
from
eight
to
ten
thousand
terrible
precipice
on
either
side
the
knife
edge
of
the
ridge
is
generally
not
much
over
a
foot
wide
the
causeway
goes
due
north
and
south
the
valley
on
my
right
hand
was
plunged
in
on
my
left
was
sparkling
with
sunlight
and
dew
i
walked
fearfully
along
this
precarious
path
for
some
miles
far
to
the
east
the
valley
was
closed
by
a
lofty
tableland
connecting
the
two
chains
of
mountains
but
overtopping
even
the
most
towering
pinnacles
this
is
called
the
sant
levels
i
was
never
there
but
i
have
heard
two
curious
facts
concerning
the
inhabitants
the
first
is
that
they
have
no
women
the
second
that
though
they
are
addicted
to
travelling
in
other
parts
they
never
acquire
habits
of
the
peoples
with
whom
they
reside
presently
i
turned
giddy
and
lay
at
full
length
for
a
great
while
clutching
the
two
edges
of
the
path
with
both
hands
and
staring
at
the
ground
i
was
lying
on
with
eyes
when
that
passed
i
felt
like
a
different
man
and
grew
conceited
and
gay
about
halfway
across
i
saw
someone
approaching
me
a
long
way
off
this
put
fear
into
my
heart
again
for
i
did
not
see
how
we
could
very
well
pass
however
i
went
slowly
on
and
presently
we
drew
near
enough
together
for
me
to
recognise
the
walker
it
was
slofork
the
sorcerer
i
had
never
met
him
before
but
i
knew
him
by
his
peculiarities
of
person
he
was
of
a
bright
gamboge
colour
and
possessed
a
very
long
nose
which
appeared
to
be
a
useful
organ
but
did
not
add
to
his
beauty
as
i
knew
beauty
he
was
dubbed
sorcerer
from
his
wondrous
skill
in
budding
limbs
and
organs
the
tale
is
told
that
one
evening
he
slowly
sawed
his
leg
off
with
a
blunt
stone
and
then
lay
for
two
days
in
agony
while
his
new
leg
was
sprouting
he
was
not
reputed
to
be
a
consistently
wise
man
but
he
had
periodical
flashes
of
penetration
and
audacity
that
none
could
equal
we
sat
down
and
faced
one
another
about
two
yards
apart
which
of
us
walks
over
the
other
asked
slofork
his
manner
was
as
calm
as
the
day
itself
but
to
my
young
nature
terrible
with
hidden
terrors
i
smiled
at
him
but
did
not
wish
for
this
humiliation
we
continued
sitting
thus
in
a
friendly
way
for
many
minutes
what
is
greater
than
pleasure
he
asked
suddenly
i
was
at
an
age
when
one
wishes
to
be
thought
equal
to
any
emergency
so
concealing
my
surprise
i
applied
myself
to
the
conversation
as
if
it
were
for
that
purpose
we
had
met
pain
i
replied
for
pain
drives
out
what
is
greater
than
pain
i
reflected
love
because
we
will
accept
our
loved
one
s
share
of
but
what
is
greater
than
love
he
persisted
nothing
and
what
is
nothing
that
you
must
tell
tell
you
i
will
this
is
shaping
s
world
he
that
is
a
good
child
here
knows
pleasure
pain
and
love
and
gets
his
rewards
but
there
s
another
shaping
there
all
this
is
unknown
and
another
order
of
things
reigns
that
world
we
call
it
is
not
nothing
but
there
was
a
pause
i
have
heard
said
i
that
you
are
good
at
growing
and
ungrowing
organs
that
s
not
enough
for
me
every
organ
tells
me
the
same
story
i
want
to
hear
different
is
it
true
what
men
say
that
your
wisdom
flows
and
ebbs
in
pulses
quite
true
replied
slofork
but
those
you
had
it
from
did
not
add
that
they
have
always
mistaken
the
flow
for
the
my
experience
is
said
i
sententiously
that
wisdom
is
perhaps
it
is
young
man
but
you
have
never
learned
that
and
never
will
for
you
the
world
will
continue
to
wear
a
noble
awful
face
you
will
never
rise
above
mysticism
but
be
happy
in
your
own
before
i
realised
what
he
was
doing
he
jumped
tranquilly
from
the
path
down
into
the
empty
void
he
crashed
with
momentum
toward
the
valley
below
i
screeched
flung
myself
down
on
the
ground
and
shut
my
eyes
often
have
i
wondered
which
of
my
juvenile
remarks
it
was
that
caused
this
sudden
resolution
on
his
part
to
commit
suicide
whichever
it
might
be
since
then
i
have
made
it
a
rigid
law
never
to
speak
for
my
own
pleasure
but
only
to
help
others
i
came
eventually
to
the
marest
i
threaded
its
mazes
in
terror
for
four
days
i
was
frightened
of
death
but
still
more
terrified
at
the
possibility
of
losing
my
sacred
attitude
toward
life
when
i
was
nearly
through
and
was
beginning
to
congratulate
myself
i
stumbled
across
the
third
extraordinary
personage
of
my
grim
muremaker
it
was
under
horrible
circumstances
on
an
afternoon
cloudy
and
stormy
i
saw
suspended
in
the
air
without
visible
support
a
living
man
he
was
hanging
in
an
upright
position
in
front
of
a
yawning
gulf
a
thousand
feet
deep
lay
beneath
his
feet
i
climbed
as
near
as
i
could
and
looked
on
he
saw
me
and
made
a
wry
grimace
like
one
who
wishes
to
turn
his
humiliation
into
humour
the
spectacle
so
astounded
me
that
i
could
not
even
grasp
what
had
happened
i
am
muremaker
he
cried
in
a
scraping
voice
which
shocked
my
ears
all
my
life
i
have
sorbed
i
am
sorbed
nuclamp
and
i
fell
out
over
a
woman
now
nuclamp
holds
me
up
like
this
while
the
strength
of
his
will
lasts
i
shall
remain
suspended
but
when
he
gets
it
can
t
be
long
drop
into
those
had
it
been
another
man
i
would
have
tried
to
save
him
but
this
like
being
was
too
well
known
to
me
as
one
who
passed
his
whole
existence
in
tormenting
murdering
and
absorbing
others
for
the
sake
of
his
own
delight
i
hurried
away
and
did
not
pause
again
that
day
in
poolingdred
i
met
joiwind
we
walked
and
talked
together
for
a
month
and
by
that
time
we
found
that
we
loved
each
other
too
well
to
panawe
stopped
speaking
that
is
a
fascinating
story
remarked
maskull
now
i
begin
to
know
my
way
around
better
but
one
thing
puzzles
what
s
that
how
it
happens
that
men
here
are
ignorant
of
tools
and
arts
and
have
no
civilisation
and
yet
contrive
to
be
social
in
their
habits
and
wise
in
their
do
you
imagine
then
that
love
and
wisdom
spring
from
tools
but
i
see
how
it
arises
in
your
world
you
have
fewer
sense
organs
and
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
you
have
been
obliged
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
stones
and
metals
that
s
by
no
means
a
sign
of
no
i
suppose
not
said
maskull
but
i
see
i
have
a
great
deal
to
they
talked
together
a
little
longer
and
then
gradually
fell
asleep
joiwind
opened
her
eyes
smiled
and
slumbered
again
chapter
the
lusion
plain
maskull
awoke
before
the
others
he
got
up
stretched
himself
and
walked
out
into
the
sunlight
branchspell
was
already
declining
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
crater
edge
and
looked
away
toward
ifdawn
the
afterglow
of
alppain
had
by
now
completely
disappeared
the
mountains
stood
up
wild
and
grand
they
impressed
him
like
a
simple
musical
theme
the
notes
of
which
are
widely
separated
in
the
scale
a
spirit
of
rashness
daring
and
adventure
seemed
to
call
to
him
from
them
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
determination
flashed
into
his
heart
to
walk
to
the
marest
and
explore
its
dangers
he
returned
to
the
cavern
to
say
to
his
hosts
joiwind
looked
at
him
with
her
brave
and
honest
eyes
is
this
selfishness
maskull
she
asked
or
are
you
drawn
by
something
stronger
than
yourself
we
must
be
reasonable
he
answered
smiling
i
can
t
settle
down
in
poolingdred
before
i
have
found
out
something
about
this
surprising
new
planet
of
yours
remember
what
a
long
way
i
have
come
but
very
likely
i
shall
come
back
will
you
make
me
a
promise
maskull
hesitated
ask
nothing
difficult
for
i
hardly
know
my
powers
it
is
not
hard
and
i
wish
it
promise
to
raise
your
hand
against
a
living
creature
either
to
strike
pluck
or
eat
without
first
recollecting
its
mother
who
suffered
for
perhaps
i
won
t
promise
that
said
maskull
slowly
but
i
ll
undertake
something
more
tangible
i
will
never
lift
my
hand
against
a
living
creature
without
first
recollecting
you
she
turned
a
little
pale
now
if
panawe
knew
that
panawe
existed
he
might
be
panawe
put
his
hand
on
her
gently
you
would
not
talk
like
that
in
shaping
s
presence
he
said
no
forgive
me
i
m
not
quite
myself
perhaps
it
is
maskull
s
blood
in
my
veins
now
let
us
bid
him
adieu
let
us
pray
that
he
will
do
only
honourable
deeds
wherever
he
may
i
ll
set
maskull
on
his
way
said
panawe
there
s
no
need
replied
maskull
the
way
is
but
talking
shortens
the
maskull
turned
to
go
joiwind
pulled
him
around
toward
her
softly
you
won
t
think
badly
of
other
women
on
my
account
you
are
a
blessed
spirit
answered
he
she
trod
quietly
to
the
inner
extremity
of
the
cave
and
stood
there
thinking
panawe
and
maskull
emerged
into
the
open
air
halfway
down
the
cliff
face
a
little
spring
was
encountered
its
water
was
colourless
transparent
but
gaseous
as
soon
as
maskull
had
satisfied
his
thirst
he
felt
himself
different
his
surroundings
were
so
real
to
him
in
their
vividness
and
colour
so
unreal
in
their
mystery
that
he
scrambled
downhill
like
one
in
a
winter
s
dream
when
they
reached
the
plain
he
saw
in
front
of
them
an
interminable
forest
of
tall
trees
the
shapes
of
which
were
extraordinarily
foreign
looking
the
leaves
were
crystalline
and
looking
upward
it
was
as
if
he
were
gazing
through
a
roof
of
glass
the
moment
they
got
underneath
the
trees
the
light
rays
of
the
sun
continued
to
come
savage
and
they
were
gelded
of
heat
then
it
was
not
hard
to
imagine
that
they
were
wandering
through
cool
bright
elfin
glades
through
the
forest
beginning
at
their
very
feet
an
avenue
perfectly
straight
and
not
very
wide
went
forward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
maskull
wanted
to
talk
to
his
travelling
companion
but
was
somehow
unable
to
find
words
panawe
glanced
at
him
with
an
inscrutable
yet
enchanting
and
half
feminine
he
then
broke
the
silence
but
strangely
enough
maskull
could
not
make
out
whether
he
was
singing
or
speaking
from
his
lips
issued
a
slow
musical
recitative
exactly
like
a
bewitching
adagio
from
a
low
toned
stringed
there
was
a
difference
instead
of
the
repetition
and
variation
of
one
or
two
short
themes
as
in
music
panawe
s
theme
was
never
came
to
an
end
but
rather
resembled
a
conversation
in
rhythm
and
melody
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
no
recitative
for
it
was
not
declamatory
it
was
a
long
quiet
stream
of
lovely
emotion
maskull
listened
entranced
yet
agitated
the
song
if
it
might
be
termed
song
seemed
to
be
always
just
on
the
point
of
becoming
clear
and
with
the
intelligibility
of
words
but
in
the
way
one
sympathises
with
another
s
moods
and
feelings
and
maskull
felt
that
something
important
was
about
to
be
uttered
which
would
explain
all
that
had
gone
before
but
it
was
invariably
postponed
he
never
yet
somehow
he
did
understand
late
in
the
afternoon
they
came
to
a
clearing
and
there
panawe
ceased
his
recitative
he
slowed
his
pace
and
stopped
in
the
fashion
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
convey
that
he
intends
to
go
no
farther
what
is
the
name
of
this
country
asked
maskull
it
is
the
lusion
was
that
music
in
the
nature
of
a
you
wish
me
not
to
go
on
your
work
lies
before
you
and
not
behind
what
was
it
then
what
work
do
you
allude
to
it
must
have
seemed
like
something
to
you
it
seemed
like
shaping
music
to
the
instant
he
had
absently
uttered
these
words
maskull
wondered
why
he
had
done
so
as
they
now
appeared
meaningless
to
him
panawe
however
showed
no
surprise
shaping
you
will
find
am
i
dreaming
or
awake
you
are
maskull
fell
into
deep
thought
so
be
it
he
said
rousing
himself
now
i
will
go
on
but
where
must
i
sleep
tonight
you
will
reach
a
broad
river
on
that
you
can
travel
to
the
foot
of
the
marest
tomorrow
but
tonight
you
had
better
sleep
where
the
forest
and
river
adieu
then
panawe
but
do
you
wish
to
say
anything
more
to
me
only
this
you
go
help
to
make
the
world
beautiful
and
not
that
s
more
than
any
of
us
can
undertake
i
am
a
simple
man
and
have
no
ambitions
in
the
way
of
beautifying
tell
joiwind
i
will
try
to
keep
myself
they
parted
rather
coldly
maskull
stood
erect
where
they
had
stopped
and
watched
panawe
out
of
sight
he
sighed
more
than
once
he
became
aware
that
something
was
about
to
happen
the
air
was
breathless
the
sunshine
unobstructed
wrapped
his
frame
in
voluptuous
heat
a
solitary
cloud
immensely
high
raced
through
the
sky
overhead
a
single
trumpet
note
sounded
in
the
far
distance
from
somewhere
behind
him
it
gave
him
an
impression
of
being
several
miles
away
at
first
but
then
it
slowly
swelled
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
at
the
same
time
that
it
increased
in
volume
still
the
same
note
sounded
but
now
it
was
as
if
blown
by
a
giant
trumpeter
immediately
over
his
head
then
it
gradually
diminished
in
force
and
travelled
away
in
front
of
him
it
ended
very
faintly
and
distantly
he
felt
himself
alone
with
nature
a
sacred
stillness
came
over
his
heart
past
and
future
were
forgotten
the
forest
the
sun
the
day
did
not
exist
for
him
he
was
unconscious
of
had
no
thoughts
and
no
feelings
yet
never
had
life
had
such
an
altitude
for
him
a
man
stood
with
crossed
arms
right
in
his
path
he
was
so
clothed
that
his
limbs
were
exposed
while
his
body
was
covered
he
was
young
rather
than
old
maskull
observed
that
his
countenance
possessed
none
of
the
special
organs
of
tormance
to
which
he
had
not
even
yet
become
reconciled
he
was
his
whole
person
seemed
to
radiate
an
excess
of
life
like
the
trembling
of
air
on
a
hot
day
his
eyes
had
such
force
that
maskull
could
not
meet
them
he
addressed
maskull
by
name
in
an
extraordinary
voice
it
had
a
double
tone
the
primary
one
sounded
far
away
the
second
was
an
undertone
like
a
sympathetic
tanging
string
maskull
felt
a
rising
joy
as
he
continued
standing
in
the
presence
of
this
individual
he
believed
that
something
good
was
happening
to
him
he
found
it
physically
difficult
to
bring
any
words
out
why
do
you
stop
me
maskull
look
well
at
me
who
am
i
i
think
you
are
i
am
maskull
again
attempted
to
meet
his
eyes
but
felt
as
if
he
were
being
stabbed
you
know
that
this
is
my
world
why
do
you
think
i
have
brought
you
here
i
wish
you
to
serve
maskull
could
no
longer
speak
those
who
joke
at
my
world
continued
the
vision
those
who
make
a
mock
of
its
stern
eternal
rhythm
its
beauty
and
sublimity
which
are
not
but
proceed
from
fathomless
shall
not
i
do
not
mock
ask
me
your
questions
and
i
will
answer
i
have
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
serve
me
maskull
do
you
not
understand
you
are
my
servant
and
i
shall
not
this
is
for
my
sake
and
not
for
these
last
words
had
no
sooner
left
surtur
s
mouth
than
maskull
saw
him
spring
suddenly
upward
and
outward
looking
up
at
the
vault
of
the
sky
he
saw
the
whole
expanse
of
vision
filled
by
surtur
s
as
a
concrete
man
but
as
a
vast
concave
cloud
image
looking
down
and
frowning
at
him
then
the
spectacle
vanished
as
a
light
goes
out
maskull
stood
inactive
with
a
thumping
heart
now
he
again
heard
the
solitary
trumpet
note
the
sound
began
this
time
faintly
in
the
far
distance
in
front
of
him
travelled
slowly
toward
him
with
regularly
increasing
intensity
passed
overhead
at
its
loudest
and
then
grew
more
and
more
quiet
wonderful
and
solemn
as
it
fell
away
in
the
rear
until
the
note
was
merged
in
the
deathlike
silence
of
the
forest
it
appeared
to
maskull
like
the
closing
of
a
marvellous
and
important
chapter
simultaneously
with
the
fading
away
of
the
sound
the
heavens
seemed
to
open
up
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
into
a
blue
vault
of
immeasurable
height
he
breathed
a
great
breath
stretched
all
his
limbs
and
looked
around
him
with
a
slow
smile
after
a
while
he
resumed
his
journey
his
brain
was
all
dark
and
confused
but
one
idea
was
already
beginning
to
stand
out
from
the
shapeless
and
grand
like
the
growing
image
in
the
soul
of
a
creative
artist
the
staggering
thought
that
he
was
a
man
of
destiny
the
more
he
reflected
upon
all
that
had
occurred
since
his
arrival
in
this
new
even
before
leaving
clearer
and
more
indisputable
it
became
that
he
could
not
be
here
for
his
own
purposes
but
must
be
here
for
an
end
but
what
that
end
was
he
could
not
imagine
through
the
forest
he
saw
branchspell
at
last
sinking
in
the
west
it
looked
a
stupendous
ball
of
red
he
could
realise
at
his
ease
what
a
sun
it
was
the
avenue
took
an
abrupt
turn
to
the
left
and
began
to
descend
steeply
a
wide
rolling
river
of
clear
and
dark
water
was
visible
in
front
of
him
no
great
way
off
it
flowed
from
north
to
south
the
forest
path
led
him
straight
to
its
banks
maskull
stood
there
and
regarded
the
lapping
gurgling
waters
pensively
on
the
opposite
bank
the
forest
continued
miles
to
the
south
poolingdred
could
just
be
distinguished
on
the
northern
skyline
the
ifdawn
mountains
loomed
wild
beautiful
and
dangerous
they
were
not
a
dozen
miles
away
like
the
first
mutterings
of
a
thunderstorm
the
first
faint
breaths
of
cool
wind
maskull
felt
the
stirrings
of
passion
in
his
heart
in
spite
of
his
bodily
fatigue
he
wished
to
test
his
strength
against
something
this
craving
he
identified
with
the
crags
of
the
marest
they
seemed
to
have
the
same
magical
attraction
for
his
will
as
the
lodestone
for
iron
he
kept
biting
his
nails
as
he
turned
his
eyes
in
that
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
conquer
the
heights
that
evening
but
when
he
glanced
back
again
at
poolingdred
he
remembered
joiwind
and
panawe
and
grew
more
tranquil
he
decided
to
make
his
bed
at
this
spot
and
to
set
off
as
soon
after
daybreak
as
he
should
awake
he
drank
at
the
river
washed
himself
and
lay
down
on
the
bank
to
sleep
by
this
time
so
far
had
his
idea
progressed
that
he
cared
nothing
for
the
possible
dangers
of
the
confided
in
his
star
branchspell
set
the
day
faded
night
with
its
terrible
weight
came
on
and
through
it
all
maskull
slept
long
before
midnight
however
he
was
awakened
by
a
crimson
glow
in
the
sky
he
opened
his
eyes
and
wondered
where
he
was
he
felt
heaviness
and
pain
the
red
glow
was
a
terrestrial
phenomenon
it
came
from
among
the
trees
he
got
up
and
went
toward
the
source
of
the
light
away
from
the
river
not
a
hundred
feet
off
he
nearly
stumbled
across
the
form
of
a
sleeping
woman
the
object
which
emitted
the
crimson
rays
was
lying
on
the
ground
several
yards
away
from
her
it
was
like
a
small
jewel
throwing
off
sparks
of
red
light
he
barely
threw
a
glance
at
that
however
the
woman
was
clothed
in
the
large
skin
of
an
animal
she
had
big
smooth
shapely
limbs
rather
muscular
than
fat
her
magn
was
not
a
thin
tentacle
but
a
third
arm
terminating
in
a
hand
her
face
which
was
upturned
was
wild
powerful
and
exceedingly
handsome
but
he
saw
with
surprise
that
in
place
of
a
breve
on
her
forehead
she
possessed
another
eye
all
three
were
closed
the
colour
of
her
skin
in
the
crimson
glow
he
could
not
distinguish
he
touched
her
gently
with
his
hand
she
awoke
calmly
and
looked
up
at
him
without
stirring
a
muscle
all
three
eyes
stared
at
him
but
the
two
lower
ones
were
dull
and
carriers
of
vision
the
middle
upper
one
alone
expressed
her
inner
nature
its
haughty
unflinching
glare
had
yet
something
seductive
and
alluring
in
it
maskull
felt
a
challenge
in
that
look
of
lordly
feminine
will
and
his
manner
instinctively
stiffened
she
sat
up
can
you
speak
my
language
he
asked
i
wouldn
t
put
such
a
question
but
others
have
been
able
why
should
you
imagine
that
i
can
t
read
your
mind
is
it
so
extremely
complex
she
spoke
in
a
rich
lingering
musical
voice
which
delighted
him
to
listen
to
no
but
you
have
no
well
but
haven
t
i
a
sorb
which
is
better
and
she
pointed
to
the
eye
on
her
brow
what
is
your
name
and
where
do
you
come
from
these
contemptuous
replies
began
to
irritate
him
and
yet
the
mere
sound
of
her
voice
was
fascinating
i
am
going
there
tomorrow
he
remarked
she
laughed
as
if
against
her
will
but
made
no
comment
my
name
is
maskull
he
went
on
i
am
a
another
so
i
should
judge
from
your
absurd
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
say
at
once
said
maskull
bluntly
are
we
or
are
we
not
to
be
friends
she
yawned
and
stretched
her
arms
without
rising
why
should
we
be
friends
if
i
thought
you
were
a
man
i
might
accept
you
as
a
you
must
look
elsewhere
for
so
be
it
maskull
now
go
away
and
leave
me
in
she
dropped
her
head
again
to
the
ground
but
did
not
at
once
close
her
eyes
what
are
you
doing
here
he
interrogated
oh
we
ifdawn
folk
occasionally
come
here
to
sleep
for
there
often
enough
it
is
a
night
for
us
which
has
no
next
being
such
a
terrible
place
and
seeing
that
i
am
a
total
stranger
it
would
be
merely
courteous
if
you
were
to
warn
me
what
i
have
to
expect
in
the
way
of
i
am
perfectly
and
utterly
indifferent
to
what
becomes
of
you
retorted
oceaxe
are
you
returning
in
the
morning
persisted
maskull
if
i
then
we
will
go
she
got
up
again
on
her
elbow
instead
of
making
plans
for
other
people
i
would
do
a
very
necessary
pray
tell
well
there
s
no
reason
why
i
should
but
i
will
i
would
try
to
convert
my
women
s
organs
into
men
s
organs
it
is
a
man
s
speak
more
oh
it
s
plain
enough
if
you
attempt
to
pass
through
ifdawn
without
a
sorb
you
are
simply
committing
suicide
and
that
magn
too
is
worse
than
you
probably
know
what
you
are
talking
about
oceaxe
but
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
she
negligently
pointed
to
the
stone
lying
on
the
ground
there
is
the
solution
if
you
hold
that
drude
to
your
organs
for
a
good
while
perhaps
it
will
start
the
change
and
perhaps
nature
will
do
the
rest
during
the
night
i
promise
oceaxe
now
really
turned
her
back
on
maskull
he
considered
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
walked
over
to
where
the
stone
was
lying
and
took
it
in
his
hand
it
was
a
pebble
the
size
of
a
hen
s
egg
radiant
with
crimson
light
as
though
and
throwing
out
a
continuous
shower
of
small
sparks
finally
deciding
that
oceaxe
s
advice
was
good
he
applied
the
drude
first
to
his
magn
and
then
to
his
breve
he
experienced
a
cauterising
feeling
of
healing
pain
chapter
oceaxe
maskull
s
second
day
on
tormance
dawned
branchspell
was
already
above
the
horizon
when
he
awoke
he
was
instantly
aware
that
his
organs
had
changed
during
the
night
his
fleshy
breve
was
altered
into
an
eyelike
sorb
his
magn
had
swelled
and
developed
into
a
third
arm
springing
from
the
breast
the
arm
gave
him
at
once
a
sense
of
greater
physical
security
but
with
the
sorb
he
was
obliged
to
experiment
before
he
could
grasp
its
function
as
he
lay
there
in
the
white
sunlight
opening
and
shutting
each
of
his
three
eyes
in
turn
he
found
that
the
two
lower
ones
served
his
understanding
the
upper
one
his
will
that
is
to
say
with
the
lower
eyes
he
saw
things
in
clear
detail
but
without
personal
interest
with
the
sorb
he
saw
nothing
as
appeared
as
an
object
of
importance
or
to
his
own
needs
rather
puzzled
as
to
how
this
would
turn
out
he
got
up
and
looked
about
him
he
had
slept
out
of
sight
of
oceaxe
he
was
anxious
to
learn
if
she
were
still
on
the
spot
but
before
going
to
ascertain
he
made
up
his
mind
to
bathe
in
the
river
it
was
a
glorious
morning
the
hot
white
sun
already
began
to
glare
but
its
heat
was
tempered
by
a
strong
wind
which
whistled
through
the
trees
a
host
of
fantastic
clouds
filled
the
sky
they
looked
like
animals
and
were
always
changing
shape
the
ground
as
well
as
the
leaves
and
branches
of
the
forest
trees
still
held
traces
of
heavy
dew
or
rain
during
the
night
a
poignantly
sweet
smell
of
nature
entered
his
nostrils
his
pain
was
quiescent
and
his
spirits
were
high
before
he
bathed
he
viewed
the
mountains
of
the
ifdawn
marest
in
the
morning
sunlight
they
stood
out
pictorially
he
guessed
that
they
were
from
five
to
six
thousand
feet
high
the
lofty
irregular
castellated
line
seemed
like
the
walls
of
a
magic
city
the
cliffs
fronting
him
were
composed
of
gaudy
emerald
yellow
ulfire
and
black
as
he
gazed
at
them
his
heart
began
to
beat
like
a
slow
heavy
drum
and
he
thrilled
all
hopes
aspirations
and
emotions
came
over
him
it
was
more
than
the
conquest
of
a
new
world
which
he
was
something
different
he
bathed
and
drank
and
as
he
was
reclothing
himself
oceaxe
strolled
indolently
up
he
could
now
perceive
the
colour
of
her
was
a
vivid
yet
delicate
mixture
of
carmine
white
and
jale
the
effect
was
startlingly
unearthly
with
these
new
colors
she
looked
like
a
genuine
representative
of
a
strange
planet
her
frame
also
had
something
curious
about
it
the
curves
were
womanly
the
bones
were
characteristically
all
seemed
somehow
to
express
a
daring
masculine
underlying
will
the
commanding
eye
on
her
forehead
set
the
same
puzzle
in
plainer
language
its
bold
domineering
egotism
was
shot
with
undergleams
of
sex
and
softness
she
came
to
the
river
s
edge
and
reviewed
him
from
top
to
toe
now
you
are
built
more
like
a
man
she
said
in
her
lovely
lingering
voice
you
see
the
experiment
was
successful
he
answered
smiling
gaily
oceaxe
continued
looking
him
over
did
some
woman
give
you
that
ridiculous
robe
a
woman
did
give
it
to
me
his
but
i
saw
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
gift
at
the
time
and
i
don
t
i
think
i
d
look
better
in
as
she
drawled
the
words
she
began
stripping
off
the
skin
which
suited
her
form
so
well
and
motioned
to
him
to
exchange
garments
he
obeyed
rather
shamefacedly
for
he
realised
that
the
proposed
exchange
was
in
fact
more
appropriate
to
his
sex
he
found
the
skin
a
freer
dress
oceaxe
in
her
drapery
appeared
more
dangerously
feminine
to
him
i
don
t
want
you
to
receive
gifts
at
all
from
other
women
she
remarked
slowly
why
not
what
can
i
be
to
you
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
during
the
her
voice
was
retarded
scornful
she
sat
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
and
looked
away
in
what
way
she
returned
no
answer
to
his
question
but
began
to
pull
off
pieces
of
the
bark
last
night
you
were
so
last
night
is
not
today
do
you
always
walk
through
the
world
with
your
head
over
your
shoulder
it
was
now
maskull
s
turn
to
be
silent
still
if
you
have
male
instincts
as
i
suppose
you
have
you
can
t
go
on
resisting
me
but
this
is
preposterous
said
maskull
opening
his
eyes
wide
granted
that
you
are
a
beautiful
can
t
be
quite
so
oceaxe
sighed
and
rose
to
her
feet
it
doesn
t
matter
i
can
from
that
i
gather
that
you
intend
to
make
the
journey
in
my
society
i
have
no
fact
i
shall
be
only
on
condition
that
you
drop
this
yet
you
do
think
me
beautiful
why
shouldn
t
i
think
so
if
it
is
the
fact
i
fail
to
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
my
feelings
bring
it
to
an
end
oceaxe
you
will
find
plenty
of
men
to
love
at
that
she
blazed
up
does
love
pick
and
choose
you
fool
do
you
imagine
i
am
so
hard
put
to
it
that
i
have
to
hunt
for
lovers
is
not
crimtyphon
waiting
for
me
at
this
very
moment
very
well
i
am
sorry
to
have
hurt
your
feelings
now
carry
the
temptation
no
it
is
a
temptation
where
a
lovely
woman
is
concerned
i
am
not
my
own
i
m
not
proposing
anything
so
very
hateful
am
i
why
do
you
humiliate
me
so
maskull
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
i
repeat
i
am
not
my
own
then
who
is
your
master
yesterday
i
saw
surtur
and
from
today
i
am
serving
did
you
speak
with
him
she
asked
curiously
i
tell
me
what
he
no
i
can
won
t
but
whatever
he
said
his
beauty
was
more
tormenting
than
yours
oceaxe
and
that
s
why
i
can
look
at
you
in
cold
did
surtur
forbid
you
to
be
a
man
maskull
frowned
is
love
such
a
manly
sport
then
i
should
have
thought
it
it
doesn
t
matter
you
won
t
always
be
so
boyish
but
don
t
try
my
patience
too
let
us
talk
about
something
above
all
let
us
get
on
our
she
suddenly
broke
into
a
laugh
so
rich
sweet
and
enchanting
that
he
grew
half
inflamed
and
half
wished
to
catch
her
body
in
his
arms
oh
maskull
a
fool
you
are
in
what
way
am
i
a
fool
he
demanded
at
her
words
but
at
his
own
weakness
isn
t
the
whole
world
the
handiwork
of
innumerable
pairs
of
lovers
and
yet
you
think
yourself
above
all
that
you
try
to
fly
away
from
nature
but
where
will
you
find
a
hole
to
hide
yourself
in
besides
beauty
i
now
credit
you
with
a
second
quality
read
me
well
and
then
it
is
natural
law
that
you
ll
think
twice
and
three
times
before
throwing
me
away
and
now
before
we
go
we
had
better
eat
said
maskull
thoughtfully
don
t
you
eat
is
food
in
the
same
category
as
love
what
food
is
it
fish
from
the
maskull
recollected
his
promise
to
joiwind
at
the
same
time
he
felt
hungry
is
there
nothing
milder
she
pulled
her
mouth
scornfully
you
came
through
poolingdred
didn
t
you
all
the
people
there
are
the
same
they
think
life
is
to
be
looked
at
and
not
lived
now
that
you
are
visiting
ifdawn
you
will
have
to
change
your
go
catch
your
fish
he
returned
pulling
down
his
brows
the
broad
clear
waters
flowed
past
them
with
swelling
undulations
from
the
direction
of
the
mountains
oceaxe
knelt
down
on
the
bank
and
peered
into
the
depths
presently
her
look
became
tense
and
concentrated
she
dipped
her
hand
in
and
pulled
out
some
sort
of
little
monster
it
was
more
like
a
reptile
than
a
fish
with
its
scaly
plates
and
teeth
she
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
it
started
crawling
about
suddenly
she
darted
all
her
will
into
her
sorb
the
creature
leaped
into
the
air
and
fell
down
dead
she
picked
up
a
slate
and
with
it
removed
the
scales
and
entrails
during
this
operation
her
hands
and
garment
became
stained
with
the
light
scarlet
blood
find
the
drude
maskull
she
said
with
a
lazy
smile
you
had
it
last
he
searched
for
it
it
was
hard
to
locate
for
its
rays
had
grown
dull
and
feeble
in
the
sunlight
but
at
last
he
found
it
oceaxe
placed
it
in
the
interior
of
the
monster
and
left
the
body
lying
on
the
ground
while
it
s
cooking
i
ll
wash
some
of
this
blood
away
which
frightens
you
so
much
have
you
never
seen
blood
before
maskull
gazed
at
her
in
perplexity
the
old
paradox
came
contrasting
sexual
characteristics
in
her
person
her
bold
masterful
masculine
egotism
of
manner
seemed
quite
incongruous
with
the
fascinating
and
disturbing
femininity
of
her
voice
a
startling
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
in
your
country
i
m
told
there
is
an
act
of
will
called
what
is
that
she
held
her
red
dripping
hands
away
from
her
draperies
and
uttered
a
delicious
clashing
laugh
you
think
i
am
half
a
man
answer
my
i
m
a
woman
through
and
through
the
marrowbone
but
that
s
not
to
say
i
have
never
absorbed
and
that
means
new
strings
for
my
harp
maskull
a
wider
range
of
passions
a
stormier
heart
for
you
for
them
i
don
t
know
the
victims
don
t
describe
their
experiences
probably
unhappiness
of
some
they
still
know
this
is
a
fearful
business
he
exclaimed
regarding
her
gloomily
one
would
think
ifdawn
a
land
of
oceaxe
gave
a
beautiful
sneer
as
she
took
a
step
toward
the
river
better
men
than
in
every
sense
of
the
walking
about
with
foreign
wills
inside
them
you
may
be
as
moral
as
you
like
maskull
but
the
fact
remains
animals
were
made
to
be
eaten
and
simple
natures
were
made
to
be
and
human
rights
count
for
nothing
she
had
bent
over
the
river
s
edge
to
wash
her
arms
and
hands
but
glanced
up
over
her
shoulder
to
answer
his
remark
they
do
count
but
we
only
regard
a
man
as
human
for
just
as
long
as
he
s
able
to
hold
his
own
with
the
flesh
was
soon
cooked
and
they
breakfasted
in
silence
maskull
cast
heavy
doubtful
glances
from
time
to
time
toward
his
companion
whether
it
was
due
to
the
strange
quality
of
the
food
or
to
his
long
abstention
he
did
not
know
but
the
meal
tasted
nauseous
and
even
cannibalistic
he
ate
little
and
the
moment
he
got
up
he
felt
defiled
let
me
bury
this
drude
where
i
can
find
it
some
other
time
said
oceaxe
on
the
next
occasion
though
i
shall
have
no
maskull
with
me
to
shock
now
we
have
to
take
to
the
they
stepped
off
the
land
onto
the
water
it
flowed
against
them
with
a
sluggish
current
but
the
opposition
instead
of
hindering
them
had
the
contrary
caused
them
to
exert
themselves
and
they
moved
faster
they
climbed
the
river
in
this
way
for
several
miles
the
exercise
gradually
improved
the
circulation
of
maskull
s
blood
and
he
began
to
look
at
things
in
a
far
more
cheerful
way
the
hot
sunshine
the
diminished
wind
the
marvellous
cloud
scenery
the
quiet
crystal
was
soothing
and
delightful
they
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
gaily
painted
heights
of
ifdawn
there
was
something
enigmatic
to
him
in
those
bright
walls
he
was
attracted
by
them
yet
felt
a
sort
of
awe
they
looked
real
but
at
the
same
time
very
supernatural
if
one
could
see
the
portrait
of
a
ghost
painted
with
a
hard
firm
outline
in
substantial
colors
the
feelings
produced
by
such
a
sight
would
be
exactly
similar
to
maskull
s
impressions
as
he
studied
the
ifdawn
precipices
he
broke
the
long
silence
those
mountains
have
most
extraordinary
shapes
all
the
lines
are
straight
and
slopes
or
she
walked
backward
on
the
water
in
order
to
face
him
that
s
typical
of
ifdawn
nature
is
all
hammer
blows
with
us
nothing
soft
and
i
hear
you
but
i
don
t
understand
all
over
the
marest
you
ll
find
patches
of
ground
plunging
down
or
rushing
up
trees
grow
fast
women
and
men
don
t
think
twice
before
acting
one
may
call
ifdawn
a
place
of
quick
maskull
was
impressed
a
fresh
wild
primitive
how
is
it
where
you
come
from
asked
oceaxe
oh
mine
is
a
decrepit
world
where
nature
takes
a
hundred
years
to
move
a
foot
of
solid
land
men
and
animals
go
about
in
flocks
originality
is
a
lost
are
there
women
there
as
with
you
and
not
very
differently
do
they
love
he
laughed
so
much
so
that
it
has
changed
the
dress
speech
and
thoughts
of
the
whole
probably
they
are
more
beautiful
than
i
no
i
think
not
said
maskull
there
was
another
rather
long
silence
as
they
travelled
unsteadily
onward
what
is
your
business
in
ifdawn
demanded
oceaxe
suddenly
he
hesitated
over
his
answer
can
you
grasp
that
it
s
possible
to
have
an
aim
right
in
front
of
one
so
big
that
one
can
t
see
it
as
a
whole
she
stole
a
long
inquisitive
look
at
him
what
sort
of
aim
a
moral
are
you
proposing
to
set
the
world
right
i
propose
am
don
t
wait
too
long
for
time
doesn
t
in
something
will
happen
said
maskull
oceaxe
threw
a
subtle
smile
so
you
have
no
special
destination
in
the
marest
no
and
if
you
ll
permit
me
i
will
come
home
with
singular
man
she
said
with
a
short
thrilling
laugh
that
s
what
i
have
been
offering
all
the
time
of
course
you
will
come
home
with
me
as
for
crimtyphon
you
mentioned
that
name
before
who
is
he
oh
my
lover
or
as
you
would
say
my
this
doesn
t
improve
matters
said
maskull
it
leaves
them
exactly
where
they
were
we
merely
have
to
remove
we
are
certainly
misunderstanding
each
other
said
maskull
quite
startled
do
you
by
any
chance
imagine
that
i
am
making
a
compact
with
you
you
will
do
nothing
against
your
will
but
you
have
promised
to
come
home
with
tell
me
how
do
you
remove
husbands
in
ifdawn
either
you
or
i
must
kill
he
eyed
her
for
a
full
minute
now
we
are
passing
from
folly
to
not
at
all
replied
oceaxe
it
is
the
truth
and
when
you
have
seen
crimtyphon
you
will
realise
i
m
aware
i
am
on
a
strange
planet
said
maskull
slowly
where
all
sorts
of
unheard
of
things
may
happen
and
where
the
very
laws
of
morality
may
be
different
still
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
murder
is
murder
and
i
ll
have
no
more
to
do
with
a
woman
who
wants
to
make
use
of
me
to
get
rid
of
her
you
think
me
wicked
demanded
oceaxe
steadily
or
then
you
had
better
leave
me
only
what
you
wish
to
be
consistent
don
t
you
leave
all
other
mad
and
wicked
people
as
well
then
you
ll
find
it
easier
to
reform
the
maskull
frowned
but
said
nothing
well
demanded
oceaxe
with
a
half
smile
i
ll
come
with
you
and
i
ll
see
only
to
warn
oceaxe
broke
into
a
cascade
of
rich
feminine
laughter
but
whether
at
the
image
conjured
up
by
maskull
s
last
words
or
from
some
other
cause
he
did
not
know
the
conversation
dropped
at
a
distance
of
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
now
towering
cliffs
the
river
made
a
sharp
turn
to
the
west
and
was
no
longer
of
use
to
them
on
their
journey
maskull
stared
up
doubtfully
it
s
a
stiff
climb
for
a
hot
let
s
rest
here
a
little
said
she
indicating
a
smooth
flat
island
of
black
rock
standing
up
just
out
of
the
water
in
the
middle
of
the
river
they
accordingly
went
to
it
and
maskull
sat
down
oceaxe
however
standing
graceful
and
erect
turned
her
face
toward
the
cliffs
opposite
and
uttered
a
piercing
and
peculiar
call
what
is
that
for
she
did
not
answer
after
waiting
a
minute
she
repeated
the
call
maskull
now
saw
a
large
bird
detach
itself
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
precipices
and
sail
slowly
down
toward
them
it
was
followed
by
two
others
the
flight
of
these
birds
was
exceedingly
slow
and
clumsy
what
are
they
he
asked
she
still
returned
no
answer
but
smiled
rather
peculiarly
and
sat
down
beside
him
before
many
minutes
he
was
able
to
distinguish
the
shapes
and
colors
of
the
flying
monsters
they
were
not
birds
but
creatures
with
long
snakelike
bodies
and
ten
reptilian
legs
apiece
terminating
in
fins
which
acted
as
wings
the
bodies
were
of
bright
blue
the
legs
and
fins
were
yellow
they
were
flying
without
haste
but
in
a
somewhat
ominous
fashion
straight
toward
them
he
could
make
out
a
long
thin
spike
projecting
from
each
of
the
heads
they
are
shrowks
explained
oceaxe
at
last
if
you
want
to
know
their
intention
i
ll
tell
you
to
make
a
meal
of
us
first
of
all
their
spikes
will
pierce
us
and
then
their
mouths
which
are
really
suckers
will
drain
us
dry
of
thoroughly
too
there
are
no
half
measures
with
shrowks
they
are
toothless
beasts
so
don
t
eat
as
you
show
such
admirable
sangfroid
said
maskull
dryly
i
take
it
there
s
no
particular
nevertheless
he
instinctively
tried
to
get
on
to
his
feet
and
failed
a
new
form
of
paralysis
was
chaining
him
to
the
ground
are
you
trying
to
get
up
asked
oceaxe
smoothly
well
yes
but
those
cursed
reptiles
seem
to
be
nailing
me
down
to
the
rock
with
their
wills
may
i
ask
if
you
had
any
special
object
in
view
in
waking
them
up
i
assure
you
the
danger
is
quite
real
maskull
instead
of
talking
and
asking
questions
you
had
much
better
see
what
you
can
do
with
your
i
seem
to
have
no
will
oceaxe
was
seized
with
a
paroxysm
of
laughter
but
it
was
still
rich
and
beautiful
it
s
obvious
you
aren
t
a
very
heroic
protector
maskull
it
seems
i
must
play
the
man
and
you
the
woman
i
expected
better
things
of
your
big
body
why
my
husband
would
send
those
creatures
dancing
all
around
the
sky
by
way
of
a
joke
before
disposing
of
them
now
watch
me
two
of
the
three
i
ll
kill
the
third
we
will
ride
home
on
which
one
shall
we
keep
the
shrowks
continued
their
slow
wobbling
flight
toward
them
their
bodies
were
of
huge
size
they
produced
in
maskull
the
same
sensation
of
loathing
as
insects
did
he
instinctively
understood
that
as
they
hunted
with
their
wills
there
was
no
necessity
for
them
to
possess
a
swift
motion
choose
which
you
please
he
said
shortly
they
are
equally
objectionable
to
then
i
ll
choose
the
leader
as
it
is
presumably
the
most
energetic
animal
watch
she
stood
upright
and
her
sorb
suddenly
blazed
with
fire
maskull
felt
something
snap
inside
his
brain
his
limbs
were
free
once
more
the
two
monsters
in
the
rear
staggered
and
darted
head
foremost
toward
the
earth
one
after
the
other
he
watched
them
crash
on
the
ground
and
then
lie
motionless
the
leader
still
came
toward
them
but
he
fancied
that
its
flight
was
altered
in
character
it
was
no
longer
menacing
but
tame
and
unwilling
oceaxe
guided
it
with
her
will
to
the
mainland
shore
opposite
their
island
rock
its
vast
bulk
lay
there
extended
awaiting
her
pleasure
they
immediately
crossed
the
water
maskull
viewed
the
shrowk
at
close
quarters
it
was
about
thirty
feet
long
its
skin
was
shining
slippery
and
leathery
a
mane
of
black
hair
covered
its
long
neck
its
face
was
awesome
and
unnatural
with
its
carnivorous
eyes
frightful
stiletto
and
sucking
cavity
there
were
true
fins
on
its
back
and
tail
have
you
a
good
seat
asked
oceaxe
patting
the
creature
s
flank
as
i
have
to
steer
let
me
jump
on
she
pulled
up
her
gown
then
climbed
up
and
sat
astride
the
animal
s
back
just
behind
the
mane
which
she
clutched
between
her
and
the
fin
there
was
just
room
for
maskull
he
grasped
the
two
flanks
with
his
outer
hands
his
third
new
arm
pressed
against
oceaxe
s
back
and
for
additional
security
he
was
compelled
to
encircle
her
waist
with
it
directly
he
did
so
he
realised
that
he
had
been
tricked
and
that
this
ride
had
been
planned
for
one
purpose
inflame
his
desires
the
third
arm
possessed
a
function
of
its
own
of
which
hitherto
he
had
been
ignorant
it
was
a
developed
magn
but
the
stream
of
love
which
was
communicated
to
it
was
no
longer
pure
and
was
boiling
passionate
and
torturing
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
kept
quiet
but
oceaxe
had
not
plotted
the
adventure
to
remain
unconscious
of
his
feelings
she
looked
around
with
a
golden
triumphant
smile
the
ride
will
last
some
time
so
hold
on
well
her
voice
was
soft
like
a
flute
but
rather
malicious
maskull
grinned
and
said
nothing
he
dared
not
remove
his
arm
the
shrowk
straddled
on
to
its
legs
it
jerked
itself
forward
and
rose
slowly
and
uncouthly
in
the
air
they
began
to
paddle
upward
toward
the
painted
cliffs
the
motion
was
swaying
rocking
and
sickening
the
contact
of
the
brute
s
slimy
skin
was
disgusting
all
this
however
was
merely
background
to
maskull
as
he
sat
there
with
closed
eyes
holding
on
to
oceaxe
in
the
front
and
centre
of
his
consciousness
was
the
knowledge
that
he
was
gripping
a
fair
woman
and
that
her
flesh
was
responding
to
his
touch
like
a
lovely
harp
they
climbed
up
and
up
he
opened
his
eyes
and
ventured
to
look
around
him
by
this
time
they
were
already
level
with
the
top
of
the
outer
rampart
of
precipices
there
now
came
in
sight
a
wild
archipelago
of
islands
with
jagged
outlines
emerging
from
a
sea
of
air
the
islands
were
mountain
summits
or
more
accurately
speaking
the
country
was
a
high
tableland
fissured
everywhere
by
narrow
and
apparently
bottomless
cracks
these
cracks
were
in
some
cases
like
canals
in
others
like
lakes
in
others
merely
holes
in
the
ground
closed
in
all
round
the
perpendicular
sides
of
the
is
the
upper
visible
parts
of
the
innumerable
cliff
of
bare
rock
gaudily
coloured
but
the
level
surfaces
were
a
tangle
of
wild
plant
life
the
taller
trees
alone
were
distinguishable
from
the
shrowk
s
back
they
were
of
different
shapes
and
did
not
look
ancient
they
were
slender
and
swaying
but
did
not
appear
very
graceful
they
looked
tough
wiry
and
savage
as
maskull
continued
to
explore
the
landscape
he
forgot
oceaxe
and
his
passion
other
strange
feelings
came
to
the
front
the
morning
was
gay
and
bright
the
sun
scorched
down
clouds
sailed
across
the
sky
the
earth
was
vivid
wild
and
lonely
yet
he
experienced
no
aesthetic
felt
nothing
but
an
intense
longing
for
action
and
possession
when
he
looked
at
anything
he
immediately
wanted
to
deal
with
it
the
atmosphere
of
the
land
seemed
not
free
but
sticky
attraction
and
repulsion
were
its
constituents
apart
from
this
wish
to
play
a
personal
part
in
what
was
going
on
around
and
beneath
him
the
scenery
had
no
significance
for
him
so
preoccupied
was
he
that
his
arm
partly
released
its
clasp
oceaxe
turned
around
to
gaze
at
him
whether
or
not
she
was
satisfied
with
what
she
saw
she
uttered
a
low
laugh
like
a
peculiar
chord
cold
again
so
quickly
maskull
what
do
you
want
he
asked
absently
still
looking
over
the
side
it
s
extraordinary
how
drawn
i
feel
to
all
you
wish
to
take
a
hand
i
wish
to
get
oh
we
have
a
good
way
to
go
yet
so
you
really
feel
different
different
from
what
what
are
you
talking
about
said
maskull
still
lost
in
abstraction
oceaxe
laughed
again
it
would
be
strange
if
we
couldn
t
make
a
man
of
you
for
the
material
is
after
that
she
turned
her
back
once
more
the
air
islands
differed
from
water
islands
in
another
way
they
were
not
on
a
plane
surface
but
sloped
upward
like
a
succession
of
broken
terraces
as
the
journey
progressed
the
shrowk
had
hitherto
been
flying
well
above
the
ground
but
now
when
a
new
line
of
towering
cliffs
confronted
them
oceaxe
did
not
urge
the
beast
upward
but
caused
it
to
enter
a
narrow
canyon
which
intersected
the
mountains
like
a
channel
they
were
instantly
plunged
into
deep
shade
the
canal
was
not
above
thirty
feet
wide
the
walls
stretched
upward
on
both
sides
for
many
hundred
feet
it
was
as
cool
as
an
ice
chamber
when
maskull
attempted
to
plumb
the
chasm
with
his
eyes
he
saw
nothing
but
black
obscurity
what
is
at
the
bottom
he
asked
death
for
you
if
you
go
to
look
for
we
know
that
i
mean
is
there
any
kind
of
life
down
there
not
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
said
oceaxe
but
of
course
all
things
are
i
think
very
likely
there
is
life
he
returned
thoughtfully
her
ironical
laugh
sounded
out
of
the
gloom
shall
we
go
down
and
see
you
find
that
amusing
no
not
that
what
i
do
find
amusing
is
the
big
stranger
with
the
beard
who
is
so
keenly
interested
in
everything
except
maskull
then
laughed
too
i
happen
to
be
the
only
thing
in
tormance
which
is
not
a
novelty
for
yes
but
i
am
a
novelty
for
the
channel
went
zigzagging
its
way
through
the
belly
of
the
mountain
and
all
the
time
they
were
gradually
rising
at
least
i
have
heard
nothing
like
your
voice
before
said
maskull
who
since
he
had
no
longer
anything
to
look
at
was
at
last
ready
for
conversation
what
s
the
matter
with
my
voice
it
s
all
that
i
can
distinguish
of
you
now
that
s
why
i
mentioned
isn
t
it
t
i
speak
distinctly
oh
it
s
clear
enough
s
inappropriate
i
won
t
explain
further
said
maskull
but
whether
you
are
speaking
or
laughing
your
voice
is
by
far
the
loveliest
and
strangest
instrument
i
have
ever
listened
to
and
yet
i
repeat
it
is
you
mean
that
my
nature
doesn
t
correspond
he
was
just
considering
his
reply
when
their
talk
was
abruptly
broken
off
by
a
huge
and
terrifying
but
not
very
loud
sound
rising
up
from
the
gulf
directly
underneath
them
it
was
a
low
grinding
roaring
thunder
the
ground
is
rising
under
us
cried
oceaxe
shall
we
escape
she
made
no
answer
but
urged
the
shrowk
s
flight
upward
at
such
a
steep
gradient
that
they
retained
their
seats
with
difficulty
the
floor
of
the
canyon
upheaved
by
some
mighty
subterranean
force
could
be
heard
and
almost
felt
coming
up
after
them
like
a
gigantic
landslip
in
the
wrong
direction
the
cliffs
cracked
and
fragments
began
to
fall
a
hundred
awful
noises
filled
the
air
growing
louder
and
louder
each
hissing
cracking
grinding
booming
exploding
roaring
when
they
had
still
fifty
feet
or
so
to
go
to
reach
the
top
a
sort
of
dark
indefinite
sea
of
broken
rocks
and
soil
appeared
under
their
feet
ascending
rapidly
with
irresistible
might
accompanied
by
the
most
horrible
noises
the
canal
was
filled
up
for
two
hundred
yards
before
and
behind
them
millions
of
tons
of
solid
matter
seemed
to
be
raised
the
shrowk
in
its
ascent
was
caught
by
the
uplifted
debris
beast
and
riders
experienced
in
that
moment
all
the
horrors
of
an
were
rolled
violently
over
and
thrown
among
the
rocks
and
dirt
all
was
thunder
instability
motion
confusion
before
they
had
time
to
realise
their
position
they
were
in
the
sunlight
the
upheaval
still
continued
in
another
minute
or
two
the
valley
floor
had
formed
a
new
mountain
a
hundred
feet
or
more
higher
than
the
old
then
its
movement
ceased
suddenly
every
noise
stopped
as
if
by
magic
not
a
rock
moved
oceaxe
and
maskull
picked
themselves
up
and
examined
themselves
for
cuts
and
bruises
the
shrowk
lay
on
its
side
panting
violently
and
sweating
with
fright
that
was
a
nasty
affair
said
maskull
flicking
the
dirt
off
his
person
oceaxe
staunched
a
cut
on
her
chin
with
a
corner
of
her
robe
it
might
have
been
far
worse
i
mean
it
s
bad
enough
to
come
up
but
it
s
death
to
go
down
and
that
happens
just
as
whatever
induces
you
to
live
in
such
a
country
i
don
t
know
maskull
habit
i
suppose
i
have
often
thought
of
moving
out
of
a
good
deal
must
be
forgiven
you
for
having
to
spend
your
life
in
a
place
like
this
where
one
is
obviously
never
safe
from
one
minute
to
you
will
learn
by
degrees
she
answered
smiling
she
looked
hard
at
the
monster
and
it
got
heavily
to
its
feet
get
on
again
maskull
she
directed
climbing
back
to
her
perch
we
haven
t
too
much
time
to
he
obeyed
they
resumed
their
interrupted
flight
this
time
over
the
mountains
and
in
full
sunlight
maskull
settled
down
again
to
his
thoughts
the
peculiar
atmosphere
of
the
country
continued
to
soak
into
his
brain
his
will
became
so
restless
and
uneasy
that
merely
to
sit
there
in
inactivity
was
a
torture
he
could
scarcely
endure
not
to
be
doing
something
how
secretive
you
are
maskull
said
oceaxe
quietly
without
turning
her
head
what
do
you
mean
oh
i
know
perfectly
well
what
s
passing
inside
you
now
i
think
it
wouldn
t
be
amiss
to
ask
friendship
still
enough
oh
don
t
ask
me
anything
growled
maskull
i
ve
far
too
many
problems
in
my
head
already
i
only
wish
i
could
answer
some
of
he
stared
stonily
at
the
landscape
the
beast
was
winging
its
way
toward
a
distant
mountain
of
singular
shape
it
was
an
enormous
natural
quadrilateral
pyramid
rising
in
great
terraces
and
terminating
in
a
broad
flat
top
on
which
what
looked
like
green
snow
still
lingered
what
mountain
is
that
he
asked
disscourn
the
highest
point
in
are
we
going
there
why
should
we
go
there
but
if
you
were
going
on
farther
it
might
be
worth
your
while
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
top
it
commands
the
whole
land
as
far
as
the
sinking
sea
and
swaylone
s
beyond
you
can
also
see
alppain
from
that
s
a
sight
i
mean
to
see
before
i
have
do
you
maskull
she
turned
around
and
put
her
hand
on
his
wrist
stay
with
me
and
one
day
we
ll
go
to
disscourn
he
grunted
unintelligibly
there
were
no
signs
of
human
existence
in
the
country
under
their
feet
while
maskull
was
still
grimly
regarding
it
a
large
tract
of
forest
not
far
ahead
bearing
many
trees
and
rocks
suddenly
subsided
with
an
awful
roar
and
crashed
down
into
an
invisible
gulf
what
was
solid
land
one
minute
became
a
chasm
the
next
he
jumped
violently
up
with
the
shock
this
is
oceaxe
remained
unmoved
why
life
here
must
be
absolutely
impossible
he
went
on
when
he
had
somewhat
recovered
himself
a
man
would
need
nerves
of
steel
is
there
no
means
at
all
of
foreseeing
a
catastrophe
like
this
oh
i
suppose
we
wouldn
t
be
alive
if
there
weren
t
replied
oceaxe
with
composure
we
are
more
or
less
clever
at
that
doesn
t
prevent
our
often
getting
you
had
better
teach
me
the
we
ll
have
many
things
to
go
over
together
and
among
them
i
expect
will
be
whether
we
are
to
stay
in
the
land
at
all
but
first
let
us
get
how
far
is
it
now
it
is
right
in
front
of
you
said
oceaxe
pointing
with
her
forefinger
you
can
see
he
followed
the
direction
of
the
finger
and
after
a
few
questions
made
out
the
spot
she
was
indicating
it
was
a
broad
peninsula
about
two
miles
distant
three
of
its
sides
rose
sheer
out
of
a
lake
of
air
the
bottom
of
which
was
invisible
its
fourth
was
a
bottleneck
joining
it
to
the
mainland
it
was
overgrown
with
bright
vegetation
distinct
in
the
brilliant
atmosphere
a
single
tall
tree
shooting
up
in
the
middle
of
the
peninsula
dwarfed
everything
else
it
was
wide
and
shady
with
leaves
i
wonder
if
crimtyphon
is
there
remarked
oceaxe
can
i
see
two
figures
or
am
i
mistaken
i
also
see
something
said
maskull
in
twenty
minutes
they
were
directly
above
the
peninsula
at
a
height
of
about
fifty
feet
the
shrowk
slackened
speed
and
came
to
earth
on
the
mainland
exactly
at
the
gateway
of
the
isthmus
they
both
with
aching
thighs
what
shall
we
do
with
the
monster
asked
oceaxe
without
waiting
for
a
suggestion
she
patted
its
hideous
face
with
her
hand
fly
away
home
i
may
want
you
some
other
it
gave
a
stupid
grunt
elevated
itself
on
its
legs
again
and
after
half
running
half
flying
for
a
few
yards
rose
awkwardly
into
the
air
and
paddled
away
in
the
same
direction
from
which
they
had
come
they
watched
it
out
of
sight
and
then
oceaxe
started
to
cross
the
neck
of
land
followed
by
maskull
branchspell
s
white
rays
beat
down
on
them
with
pitiless
force
the
sky
had
by
degrees
become
cloudless
and
the
wind
had
dropped
entirely
the
ground
was
a
rich
riot
of
vividly
coloured
ferns
shrubs
and
grasses
through
these
could
be
seen
here
and
there
the
golden
chalky
occasionally
a
glittering
white
metallic
boulder
everything
looked
extraordinary
and
barbaric
maskull
was
at
last
walking
in
the
weird
ifdawn
marest
which
had
created
such
strange
feelings
in
him
when
seen
from
a
distance
and
now
he
felt
no
wonder
or
curiosity
at
all
but
only
desired
to
meet
human
intense
had
grown
his
will
he
longed
to
test
his
powers
on
his
fellow
creatures
and
nothing
else
seemed
of
the
least
importance
to
him
on
the
peninsula
all
was
coolness
and
delicate
shade
it
resembled
a
large
copse
about
two
acres
in
extent
in
the
heart
of
the
tangle
of
small
trees
and
undergrowth
was
a
partially
cleared
the
roots
of
the
giant
tree
growing
in
the
centre
had
killed
off
the
smaller
fry
all
around
it
by
the
side
of
the
tree
sparkled
a
little
bubbling
fountain
whose
water
was
the
precipices
on
all
sides
overhung
with
thorns
flowers
and
creepers
invested
the
enclosure
with
an
air
of
wild
and
charming
mythological
mountain
god
might
have
dwelt
here
maskull
s
restless
eye
left
everything
to
fall
on
the
two
men
who
formed
the
centre
of
the
picture
one
was
reclining
in
the
ancient
grecian
fashion
of
banqueters
on
a
tall
couch
of
mosses
sprinkled
with
flowers
he
rested
on
one
arm
and
was
eating
a
kind
of
plum
with
calm
enjoyment
a
pile
of
these
plums
lay
on
the
couch
beside
him
the
branches
of
the
tree
completely
sheltered
him
from
the
sun
his
small
boyish
form
was
clad
in
a
rough
skin
leaving
his
limbs
naked
maskull
could
not
tell
from
his
face
whether
he
were
a
young
boy
or
a
grown
man
the
features
were
smooth
soft
and
childish
their
expression
was
seraphically
tranquil
but
his
violet
upper
eye
was
sinister
and
adult
his
skin
was
of
the
colour
of
yellow
ivory
his
long
curling
hair
matched
his
was
violet
the
second
man
was
standing
erect
before
the
other
a
few
feet
away
from
him
he
was
short
and
muscular
his
face
was
broad
bearded
and
rather
commonplace
but
there
was
something
terrible
about
his
appearance
the
features
were
distorted
by
a
look
of
pain
despair
and
horror
oceaxe
without
pausing
strolled
lightly
and
lazily
up
to
the
outermost
shadows
of
the
tree
some
distance
from
the
couch
we
have
met
with
an
uplift
she
remarked
carelessly
looking
toward
the
youth
he
eyed
her
but
said
nothing
how
is
your
plant
man
getting
on
her
tone
was
artificial
but
extremely
beautiful
while
waiting
for
an
answer
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
her
legs
gracefully
thrust
under
her
body
and
pulled
down
the
skirt
of
her
robe
maskull
remained
standing
just
behind
her
with
crossed
arms
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
why
don
t
you
answer
your
mistress
sature
said
the
boy
on
the
couch
in
a
calm
treble
voice
the
man
addressed
did
not
alter
his
expression
but
replied
in
a
strangled
tone
i
am
getting
on
very
well
oceaxe
there
are
already
buds
on
my
feet
tomorrow
i
hope
to
take
maskull
felt
a
rising
storm
inside
him
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
although
these
words
were
uttered
by
sature
they
were
being
dictated
by
the
boy
what
he
says
is
quite
true
remarked
the
latter
tomorrow
roots
will
reach
the
ground
and
in
a
few
days
they
ought
to
be
well
established
then
i
shall
set
to
work
to
convert
his
arms
into
branches
and
his
fingers
into
leaves
it
will
take
longer
to
transform
his
head
into
a
crown
but
still
i
fact
i
can
almost
promise
that
within
a
month
you
and
i
oceaxe
will
be
plucking
and
enjoying
fruit
from
this
new
and
remarkable
i
love
these
natural
experiments
he
concluded
putting
out
his
hand
for
another
plum
they
thrill
this
must
be
a
joke
said
maskull
taking
a
step
forward
the
youth
looked
at
him
serenely
he
made
no
reply
but
maskull
felt
as
if
he
were
being
thrust
backward
by
an
iron
hand
on
his
throat
the
morning
s
work
is
now
concluded
sature
come
here
again
after
blodsombre
after
tonight
you
will
remain
here
permanently
i
expect
so
you
had
better
set
to
work
to
clear
a
patch
of
ground
for
your
roots
never
fresh
and
charming
these
plants
appear
to
you
now
in
the
future
they
will
be
your
deadliest
rivals
and
enemies
now
you
may
the
man
limped
painfully
away
across
the
isthmus
out
of
sight
oceaxe
yawned
maskull
pushed
his
way
forward
as
if
against
a
wall
are
you
joking
or
are
you
a
devil
i
am
crimtyphon
i
never
joke
for
that
epithet
of
yours
i
will
devise
a
new
punishment
for
the
duel
of
wills
commenced
without
ceremony
oceaxe
got
up
stretched
her
beautiful
limbs
smiled
and
prepared
herself
to
witness
the
struggle
between
her
old
lover
and
her
new
crimtyphon
smiled
too
he
reached
out
his
hand
for
more
fruit
but
did
not
eat
it
maskull
s
control
broke
down
and
he
dashed
at
the
boy
choking
with
red
beard
wagged
and
his
face
was
crimson
when
he
realised
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
crimtyphon
left
off
smiling
slipped
off
the
couch
and
threw
a
terrible
and
malignant
glare
into
his
sorb
maskull
staggered
he
gathered
together
all
the
brute
force
of
his
will
and
by
sheer
weight
continued
his
advance
the
boy
shrieked
and
ran
behind
the
couch
trying
to
get
away
his
opposition
suddenly
collapsed
maskull
stumbled
forward
recovered
himself
and
then
vaulted
clear
over
the
high
pile
of
mosses
to
get
at
his
antagonist
he
fell
on
top
of
him
with
all
his
bulk
grasping
his
throat
he
pulled
his
little
head
completely
around
so
that
the
neck
was
broken
crimtyphon
immediately
died
the
corpse
lay
underneath
the
tree
with
its
face
upturned
maskull
viewed
it
attentively
and
as
he
did
so
an
expression
of
awe
and
wonder
came
into
his
own
countenance
in
the
moment
of
death
crimtyphon
s
face
had
undergone
a
startling
and
even
shocking
alteration
its
personal
character
had
wholly
vanished
giving
place
to
a
vulgar
grinning
mask
which
expressed
nothing
he
did
not
have
to
search
his
mind
long
to
remember
where
he
had
seen
the
brother
of
that
expression
it
was
identical
with
that
on
the
face
of
the
apparition
at
the
siance
after
krag
had
dealt
with
it
chapter
tydomin
oceaxe
sat
down
carelessly
on
the
couch
of
mosses
and
began
eating
the
plums
you
see
you
had
to
kill
him
maskull
she
said
in
a
rather
quizzical
voice
he
came
away
from
the
corpse
and
regarded
red
and
still
breathing
hard
it
s
no
joking
matter
you
especially
ought
to
keep
why
because
he
was
your
you
think
i
ought
to
show
i
feel
none
don
t
pretend
woman
oceaxe
smiled
from
your
manner
one
would
think
you
were
accusing
me
of
some
maskull
literally
snorted
at
her
words
what
you
live
with
live
in
the
arms
of
a
morbid
monstrosity
and
oh
now
i
grasp
it
she
said
in
a
tone
of
perfect
detachment
i
m
well
maskull
she
proceeded
after
a
pause
and
who
gave
you
the
right
to
rule
my
conduct
am
i
not
mistress
of
my
own
person
he
looked
at
her
with
disgust
but
said
nothing
there
was
another
long
interval
of
silence
i
never
loved
him
said
oceaxe
at
last
looking
at
the
ground
that
makes
it
all
the
what
does
all
this
do
you
want
nothing
from
heaven
she
gave
a
hard
laugh
you
come
here
with
your
foreign
preconceptions
and
expect
us
all
to
bow
down
to
what
preconceptions
just
because
crimtyphon
s
sports
are
strange
to
you
you
murder
you
would
like
to
murder
sports
that
diabolical
oh
you
re
sentimental
said
oceaxe
contemptuously
why
do
you
need
to
make
such
a
fuss
over
that
man
life
is
life
all
the
world
over
and
one
form
is
as
good
as
another
he
was
only
to
be
made
a
tree
like
a
million
other
trees
if
they
can
endure
the
life
why
can
t
he
and
this
is
ifdawn
morality
oceaxe
began
to
grow
angry
it
s
you
who
have
peculiar
ideas
you
rave
about
the
beauty
of
flowers
and
think
them
divine
but
when
it
s
a
question
of
taking
on
this
divine
fresh
pure
enchanting
loveliness
yourself
in
your
own
person
it
immediately
becomes
a
cruel
and
wicked
degradation
here
we
have
a
strange
riddle
in
my
oceaxe
you
re
a
beautiful
heartless
wild
more
if
you
weren
t
a
well
her
let
us
hear
what
would
happen
if
i
weren
t
a
woman
maskull
bit
his
nails
it
doesn
t
matter
i
can
t
touch
there
s
certainly
not
the
difference
of
a
hair
between
you
and
your
for
this
you
may
thank
my
foreign
farewell
he
turned
to
go
oceaxe
s
eyes
slanted
at
him
through
their
long
lashes
where
are
you
off
to
maskull
that
s
a
matter
of
no
importance
for
wherever
i
go
it
must
be
a
change
for
the
better
you
walking
whirlpools
of
crime
wait
a
minute
i
only
want
to
say
this
blodsombre
is
just
starting
and
you
had
better
stay
here
till
the
afternoon
we
can
quickly
put
that
body
out
of
sight
and
as
you
seem
to
detest
me
so
much
the
place
is
big
needn
t
talk
or
even
see
each
i
don
t
wish
to
breathe
the
same
singular
man
she
was
sitting
erect
and
motionless
like
a
beautiful
statue
and
what
of
your
wonderful
interview
with
surtur
and
all
the
undone
things
which
you
set
out
to
do
you
aren
t
the
one
i
shall
speak
to
about
that
but
eyed
her
while
i
m
still
here
you
can
tell
me
this
what
s
the
meaning
of
the
expression
on
that
corpse
s
face
is
that
another
crime
maskull
all
dead
people
look
like
that
ought
they
not
to
i
once
heard
it
called
crystalman
s
why
not
we
are
all
daughters
and
sons
of
crystalman
it
is
doubtless
the
family
it
has
also
been
told
me
that
surtur
and
crystalman
are
one
and
the
you
have
wise
and
truthful
then
how
could
it
have
been
surtur
whom
i
saw
said
maskull
more
to
himself
than
to
her
that
apparition
was
something
quite
she
dropped
her
mocking
manner
and
sliding
imperceptibly
toward
him
gently
pulled
his
arm
you
have
to
talk
sit
down
beside
me
and
ask
me
your
questions
i
m
not
excessively
smart
but
i
ll
try
to
be
of
maskull
permitted
himself
to
be
dragged
down
with
soft
violence
she
bent
toward
him
as
if
confidentially
and
contrived
that
her
sweet
cool
feminine
breath
should
fan
his
cheek
aren
t
you
here
to
alter
the
evil
to
the
good
maskull
then
what
does
it
matter
who
sent
you
what
can
you
possibly
know
of
good
and
evil
are
you
only
instructing
the
initiated
who
am
i
to
instruct
anybody
however
you
re
quite
right
i
wish
to
do
what
i
because
i
am
qualified
but
because
i
am
oceaxe
s
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
you
re
a
giant
both
in
body
and
soul
what
you
want
to
do
you
can
is
that
your
honest
opinion
or
are
you
flattering
me
for
your
own
ends
she
sighed
don
t
you
see
how
difficult
you
are
making
the
conversation
let
s
talk
about
your
work
not
about
maskull
suddenly
noticed
a
strange
blue
light
glowing
in
the
northern
sky
it
was
from
alppain
but
alppain
itself
was
behind
the
hills
while
he
was
observing
it
a
peculiar
wave
of
of
a
disquieting
nature
passed
through
him
he
looked
at
oceaxe
and
it
struck
him
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
being
unnecessarily
brutal
to
her
he
had
forgotten
that
she
was
a
woman
and
defenceless
won
t
you
stay
she
asked
all
of
a
sudden
quite
openly
and
frankly
yes
i
think
i
ll
stay
he
replied
slowly
and
another
thing
i
ve
misjudged
your
character
pray
forgive
me
i
m
a
hasty
passionate
there
are
enough
easygoing
men
hard
knocks
are
a
good
medicine
for
vicious
hearts
and
you
didn
t
misjudge
my
character
as
far
as
you
every
woman
has
more
than
one
character
don
t
you
know
that
during
the
pause
that
followed
a
snapping
of
twigs
was
heard
and
both
looked
around
startled
they
saw
a
woman
stepping
slowly
across
the
neck
that
separated
them
from
the
mainland
tydomin
muttered
oceaxe
in
a
vexed
frightened
voice
she
immediately
moved
away
from
maskull
and
stood
up
the
newcomer
was
of
middle
height
very
slight
and
graceful
she
was
no
longer
quite
young
her
face
wore
the
composure
of
a
woman
who
knows
her
way
about
the
world
it
was
intensely
pale
and
under
its
quiescence
there
just
was
a
glimpse
of
something
strange
and
dangerous
it
was
curiously
alluring
though
not
exactly
beautiful
her
hair
was
clustering
and
boyish
reaching
only
to
the
neck
it
was
of
a
strange
indigo
colour
she
was
quaintly
attired
in
a
tunic
and
breeches
pieced
together
from
the
square
plates
of
some
reptile
her
small
breasts
were
exposed
her
sorb
was
black
and
contemplative
without
once
glancing
up
at
oceaxe
and
maskull
she
quietly
glided
straight
toward
crimtyphon
s
corpse
when
she
arrived
within
a
few
feet
of
it
she
stopped
and
looked
down
with
arms
folded
oceaxe
drew
maskull
a
little
away
and
whispered
it
s
crimtyphon
s
other
wife
who
lives
under
disscourn
she
s
a
most
dangerous
woman
be
careful
what
you
say
if
she
asks
you
to
do
anything
refuse
it
the
poor
soul
looks
harmless
yes
she
the
poor
soul
is
quite
capable
of
swallowing
up
krag
himself
now
play
the
the
murmur
of
their
voices
seemed
to
attract
tydomin
s
notice
for
she
now
slowly
turned
her
eyes
toward
them
who
killed
him
she
demanded
her
voice
was
so
soft
low
and
refined
that
maskull
hardly
was
able
to
catch
the
words
the
sounds
however
lingered
in
his
ears
and
curiously
enough
seemed
to
grow
stronger
instead
of
fainter
oceaxe
whispered
don
t
say
a
word
leave
it
all
to
then
she
swung
her
body
around
to
face
tydomin
squarely
and
said
aloud
i
killed
tydomin
s
words
by
this
time
were
ringing
in
maskull
s
head
like
an
actual
physical
sound
there
was
no
question
of
being
able
to
ignore
them
he
had
to
make
an
open
confession
of
his
act
whatever
the
consequences
might
be
quietly
taking
oceaxe
by
the
shoulder
and
putting
her
behind
him
he
said
in
a
low
but
perfectly
distinct
voice
it
was
i
that
killed
oceaxe
looked
both
haughty
and
frightened
maskull
says
that
so
as
to
shield
me
as
he
thinks
i
require
no
shield
maskull
i
killed
him
i
believe
you
oceaxe
you
did
murder
him
not
with
your
own
strength
for
you
brought
this
man
along
for
the
maskull
took
a
couple
of
steps
toward
tydomin
it
s
of
little
consequence
who
killed
him
for
he
s
better
dead
than
alive
in
my
opinion
still
i
did
it
oceaxe
had
no
hand
in
the
tydomin
appeared
not
to
hear
looked
beyond
him
at
oceaxe
musingly
when
you
murdered
him
didn
t
it
occur
to
you
that
i
would
come
here
to
find
out
i
never
once
thought
of
you
replied
oceaxe
with
an
angry
laugh
do
you
really
imagine
that
i
carry
your
image
with
me
wherever
i
go
if
someone
were
to
murder
your
lover
here
what
would
you
do
lying
hypocrite
oceaxe
spat
out
you
never
were
in
love
with
crimtyphon
you
always
hated
me
and
now
you
think
it
an
excellent
opportunity
to
make
it
good
now
that
crimtyphon
s
gone
for
we
both
know
he
would
have
made
a
footstool
of
you
if
i
had
asked
him
he
worshiped
me
but
he
laughed
at
you
he
thought
you
tydomin
flashed
a
quick
gentle
smile
at
maskull
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
listen
to
all
this
without
question
and
feeling
it
the
right
thing
to
do
he
walked
away
out
of
earshot
tydomin
approached
oceaxe
perhaps
because
my
beauty
fades
and
i
m
no
longer
young
i
needed
him
all
the
oceaxe
gave
a
kind
of
snarl
well
he
s
dead
and
that
s
the
end
of
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
tydomin
the
other
woman
smiled
faintly
and
rather
pathetically
there
s
nothing
left
to
do
except
mourn
the
dead
you
won
t
grudge
me
that
last
office
do
you
want
to
stay
here
demanded
oceaxe
suspiciously
yes
oceaxe
dear
i
wish
to
be
then
what
is
to
become
of
us
i
thought
that
you
and
your
is
his
name
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
two
would
go
to
disscourn
and
spend
blodsombre
at
my
oceaxe
called
out
aloud
to
maskull
will
you
come
with
me
now
to
disscourn
if
you
wish
returned
maskull
go
first
oceaxe
i
must
question
your
friend
about
crimtyphon
s
death
i
won
t
keep
why
don
t
you
question
me
rather
demanded
oceaxe
looking
up
sharply
tydomin
gave
the
shadow
of
a
smile
we
know
each
other
too
play
no
tricks
said
oceaxe
and
she
turned
to
go
surely
you
must
be
dreaming
said
tydomin
that
s
the
you
want
to
walk
over
the
the
path
oceaxe
had
chosen
led
across
the
isthmus
the
direction
which
tydomin
proposed
for
her
was
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
into
empty
space
shaping
i
must
be
mad
cried
oceaxe
with
a
laugh
and
she
obediently
followed
the
other
s
finger
she
walked
straight
on
toward
the
edge
of
the
abyss
twenty
paces
away
maskull
pulled
his
beard
around
and
wondered
what
she
was
doing
tydomin
remained
standing
with
outstretched
finger
watching
her
without
hesitation
without
slackening
her
step
once
oceaxe
strolled
when
she
had
reached
the
extreme
end
of
the
land
she
still
took
one
more
step
maskull
saw
her
limbs
wrench
as
she
stumbled
over
the
edge
her
body
disappeared
and
as
it
did
so
an
awful
shriek
sounded
disillusionment
had
come
to
her
an
instant
too
late
he
tore
himself
out
of
his
stupor
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
threw
himself
on
the
ground
recklessly
and
looked
over
oceaxe
had
vanished
he
continued
staring
wildly
down
for
several
minutes
and
then
began
to
sob
tydomin
came
up
to
him
and
he
got
to
his
feet
the
blood
kept
rushing
to
his
face
and
leaving
it
again
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
speak
at
all
then
he
brought
out
the
words
with
difficulty
you
shall
pay
for
this
tydomin
but
first
i
want
to
hear
why
you
did
hadn
t
i
cause
she
asked
standing
with
downcast
eyes
was
it
pure
fiendishness
it
was
for
crimtyphon
s
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
death
i
told
you
you
are
loyal
to
her
and
i
m
loyal
to
loyal
you
ve
made
a
terrible
blunder
she
wasn
t
my
mistress
i
killed
crimtyphon
for
quite
another
reason
she
had
absolutely
no
part
in
wasn
t
she
your
lover
asked
tydomin
slowly
you
ve
made
a
terrible
mistake
repeated
maskull
i
killed
him
because
he
was
a
wild
beast
she
was
as
innocent
of
his
death
as
you
tydomin
s
face
took
on
a
hard
look
so
you
are
guilty
of
two
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
why
couldn
t
you
believe
me
asked
maskull
who
was
pale
and
sweating
painfully
who
gave
you
the
right
to
kill
him
demanded
tydomin
sternly
he
said
nothing
and
perhaps
did
not
hear
her
question
she
sighed
two
or
three
times
and
began
to
stir
restlessly
since
you
murdered
him
you
must
help
me
bury
what
s
to
be
done
this
is
a
most
fearful
you
are
a
most
fearful
man
why
did
you
come
here
to
do
all
this
what
are
we
to
you
unfortunately
you
are
another
pause
ensued
it
s
no
use
standing
here
said
tydomin
nothing
can
be
done
you
must
come
with
come
with
you
where
to
to
disscourn
there
s
a
burning
lake
on
the
far
side
of
it
he
always
wished
to
be
cast
there
after
death
we
can
do
that
after
the
meantime
we
must
take
him
you
re
a
callous
heartless
woman
why
should
he
be
buried
when
that
poor
girl
must
remain
unburied
you
know
that
s
out
of
the
question
replied
tydomin
quietly
maskull
s
eyes
roamed
about
agitatedly
apparently
seeing
nothing
we
must
do
something
she
continued
i
shall
go
you
can
t
wish
to
stay
here
alone
no
i
couldn
t
stay
why
should
i
want
to
you
want
me
to
carry
the
corpse
he
can
t
carry
himself
and
you
murdered
him
perhaps
it
will
ease
your
mind
to
carry
ease
my
mind
said
maskull
rather
stupidly
there
s
only
one
relief
for
remorse
and
that
s
voluntary
and
have
you
no
remorse
he
asked
fixing
her
with
a
heavy
eye
these
crimes
are
yours
maskull
she
said
in
a
low
but
incisive
voice
they
walked
over
to
crimtyphon
s
body
and
maskull
hoisted
it
on
to
his
shoulders
it
weighed
heavier
than
he
had
thought
tydomin
did
not
offer
to
assist
him
to
adjust
the
ghastly
burden
she
crossed
the
isthmus
followed
by
maskull
their
path
lay
through
sunshine
and
shadow
branchspell
was
blazing
in
a
cloudless
sky
the
heat
was
of
sweat
coursed
down
his
face
and
the
corpse
seemed
to
grow
heavier
and
heavier
tydomin
always
walked
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
were
fastened
in
an
unseeing
stare
on
her
white
womanish
calves
he
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
his
features
grew
sullen
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
he
suddenly
allowed
his
burden
to
slip
off
his
shoulders
on
to
the
ground
where
it
lay
sprawled
every
which
way
he
called
out
to
tydomin
she
quickly
looked
around
come
here
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
why
should
i
be
carrying
this
why
should
i
be
following
you
at
all
what
surprises
me
is
why
this
has
never
struck
me
she
at
once
came
back
to
him
i
suppose
you
re
tired
maskull
let
us
sit
down
perhaps
you
have
come
a
long
way
this
morning
oh
it
s
not
tiredness
but
a
sudden
gleam
of
sense
do
you
know
of
any
reason
why
i
should
be
acting
as
your
porter
he
laughed
again
but
nevertheless
sat
down
on
the
ground
beside
her
tydomin
neither
looked
at
him
nor
answered
her
head
was
half
bent
so
as
to
face
the
northern
sky
where
the
alppain
light
was
still
glowing
maskull
followed
her
gaze
and
also
watched
the
glow
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
why
don
t
you
speak
he
asked
at
last
what
does
that
light
suggest
to
you
maskull
i
m
not
speaking
of
that
doesn
t
it
suggest
anything
at
all
perhaps
it
doesn
t
what
does
it
matter
not
sacrifice
maskull
grew
sullen
again
sacrifice
of
what
what
do
you
mean
hasn
t
it
entered
your
head
yet
said
tydomin
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
and
speaking
in
her
delicate
hard
manner
that
this
adventure
of
yours
will
scarcely
come
to
an
end
until
you
have
made
some
sort
of
sacrifice
he
returned
no
answer
and
she
said
nothing
more
in
a
few
minutes
time
maskull
got
up
of
his
own
accord
and
irreverently
and
almost
angrily
threw
crimtyphon
s
corpse
over
his
shoulder
again
how
far
do
we
have
to
go
he
asked
in
a
surly
tone
an
hour
s
lead
still
this
isn
t
the
sacrifice
i
mean
said
tydomin
quietly
as
she
went
on
in
front
almost
immediately
they
reached
more
difficult
ground
they
had
to
pass
from
peak
to
peak
as
from
island
to
island
in
some
cases
they
were
able
to
stride
or
jump
across
but
in
others
they
had
to
make
use
of
rude
bridges
of
fallen
timber
it
appeared
to
be
a
frequented
path
underneath
were
the
black
impenetrable
the
surface
were
the
glaring
sunshine
the
gay
painted
rocks
the
chaotic
tangle
of
strange
plants
there
were
countless
reptiles
and
insects
the
latter
were
thicker
built
than
those
of
still
more
disgusting
and
some
of
them
were
of
enormous
size
one
monstrous
insect
as
large
as
a
horse
stood
right
in
the
centre
of
their
path
without
budging
it
was
had
jaws
like
scimitars
and
underneath
its
body
was
a
forest
of
legs
tydomin
gave
one
malignant
look
at
it
and
sent
it
crashing
into
the
gulf
what
have
i
to
offer
except
my
life
maskull
suddenly
broke
out
and
what
good
is
that
it
won
t
bring
that
poor
girl
back
into
the
sacrifice
is
not
for
utility
it
s
a
penalty
which
we
i
know
the
point
is
whether
you
can
go
on
enjoying
life
after
what
has
she
waited
for
maskull
to
come
even
with
her
perhaps
you
imagine
i
m
not
man
imagine
that
because
i
allowed
poor
oceaxe
to
die
for
she
did
die
for
you
said
tydomin
in
a
quiet
emphatic
voice
that
would
be
a
second
blunder
of
yours
returned
maskull
just
as
firmly
i
was
not
in
love
with
oceaxe
and
i
m
not
in
love
with
your
life
is
not
then
i
don
t
understand
what
you
want
or
what
you
are
speaking
it
s
not
for
me
to
ask
a
sacrifice
from
you
maskull
that
would
be
compliance
on
your
part
but
not
sacrifice
you
must
wait
until
you
feel
there
s
nothing
else
for
you
to
it
s
all
very
the
conversation
was
abruptly
cut
short
by
a
prolonged
and
frightful
crashing
roaring
sound
coming
from
a
short
distance
ahead
it
was
accompanied
by
a
violent
oscillation
of
the
ground
on
which
they
stood
they
looked
up
startled
just
in
time
to
witness
the
final
disappearance
of
a
huge
mass
of
forest
land
not
two
hundred
yards
in
front
of
them
several
acres
of
trees
plants
rocks
and
soil
with
all
its
teeming
animal
life
vanished
before
their
eyes
like
a
magic
story
the
new
chasm
was
cut
as
if
by
a
knife
beyond
its
farther
edge
the
alppain
glow
burned
blue
just
over
the
horizon
now
we
shall
have
to
make
a
detour
said
tydomin
halting
maskull
caught
hold
of
her
with
his
third
hand
listen
to
me
while
i
try
to
describe
what
i
m
feeling
when
i
saw
that
landslip
everything
i
have
heard
about
the
last
destruction
of
the
world
came
into
my
mind
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
were
actually
witnessing
it
and
that
the
world
were
really
falling
to
pieces
then
where
the
land
was
we
now
have
this
empty
awful
s
to
say
it
seems
to
me
as
if
our
life
will
come
to
the
same
condition
where
there
was
something
there
will
be
nothing
but
that
terrible
blue
glare
on
the
opposite
side
is
exactly
like
the
eye
of
fate
it
accuses
us
and
demands
what
we
have
made
of
our
life
which
is
no
more
at
the
same
time
it
is
grand
and
joyful
the
joy
consists
in
it
is
in
our
power
to
give
freely
what
will
later
on
be
taken
from
us
by
tydomin
watched
him
attentively
then
your
feeling
is
that
your
life
is
worthless
and
you
make
a
present
of
it
to
the
first
one
who
asks
no
it
goes
beyond
that
i
feel
that
the
only
thing
worth
living
for
is
to
be
so
magnanimous
that
fate
itself
will
be
astonished
at
us
understand
me
it
isn
t
cynicism
or
bitterness
or
despair
but
heroism
it
s
hard
to
now
you
shall
hear
what
sacrifice
i
offer
you
maskull
it
s
a
heavy
one
but
that
s
what
you
seem
to
that
is
so
in
my
present
mood
it
can
t
be
too
then
if
you
are
in
earnest
resign
your
body
to
me
now
that
crimtyphon
s
dead
i
m
tired
of
being
a
i
fail
to
listen
then
i
wish
to
start
a
new
existence
in
your
body
i
wish
to
be
a
male
i
see
it
isn
t
worth
while
being
a
woman
i
mean
to
dedicate
my
own
body
to
crimtyphon
i
shall
tie
his
body
and
mine
together
and
give
them
a
common
funeral
in
the
burning
lake
that
s
the
sacrifice
i
offer
you
as
i
said
it
s
a
hard
so
you
do
ask
me
to
die
though
how
you
can
make
use
of
my
body
is
difficult
to
no
i
don
t
ask
you
to
die
you
will
go
on
how
is
it
possible
without
a
body
tydomin
gazed
at
him
earnestly
there
are
many
such
beings
even
in
your
world
there
you
call
them
spirits
apparitions
phantoms
they
are
in
reality
living
wills
deprived
of
material
bodies
always
longing
to
act
and
enjoy
but
quite
unable
to
do
so
are
you
enough
to
accept
such
a
state
do
you
think
if
it
s
possible
i
accept
it
replied
maskull
quietly
not
in
spite
of
its
heaviness
but
because
of
it
but
how
is
it
possible
undoubtedly
there
are
very
many
things
possible
in
our
world
of
which
you
have
no
conception
now
let
us
wait
till
we
get
home
i
don
t
hold
you
to
your
word
for
unless
it
s
a
free
sacrifice
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
i
am
not
a
man
who
speaks
lightly
if
you
can
perform
this
miracle
you
have
my
consent
once
for
then
we
ll
leave
it
like
that
for
the
present
said
tydomin
sadly
they
proceeded
on
their
way
owing
to
the
subsidence
tydomin
seemed
rather
doubtful
at
first
as
to
the
right
road
but
by
making
a
long
divergence
they
eventually
got
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
newly
formed
chasm
a
little
later
on
in
a
narrow
copse
crowning
a
miniature
insulated
peak
they
fell
in
with
a
man
he
was
resting
himself
against
a
tree
and
looked
tired
overheated
and
despondent
he
was
young
his
beardless
expression
bore
an
expression
of
unusual
sincerity
and
in
other
respects
he
seemed
a
hardy
hardworking
youth
of
an
intellectual
type
his
hair
was
thick
short
and
flaxen
he
possessed
neither
a
sorb
nor
a
third
presumably
he
was
not
a
native
of
ifdawn
his
forehead
however
was
disfigured
by
what
looked
like
a
haphazard
assortment
of
eyes
eight
in
number
of
different
sizes
and
shapes
they
went
in
pairs
and
whenever
two
were
in
use
it
was
indicated
by
a
peculiar
rest
remained
dull
until
their
turn
came
in
addition
to
the
upper
eyes
he
had
the
two
lower
ones
but
they
were
vacant
and
lifeless
this
extraordinary
battery
of
eyes
alternatively
alive
and
dead
gave
the
young
man
an
appearance
of
almost
alarming
mental
activity
he
was
wearing
nothing
but
a
sort
of
skin
kilt
maskull
seemed
somehow
to
recognise
the
face
though
he
had
certainly
never
set
eyes
on
it
before
tydomin
suggested
to
him
to
set
down
the
corpse
and
both
sat
down
to
rest
in
the
shade
question
him
maskull
she
said
rather
carelessly
jerking
her
head
toward
the
stranger
maskull
sighed
and
asked
aloud
from
his
seat
on
the
ground
what
s
your
name
and
where
do
you
come
from
the
man
studied
him
for
a
few
moments
first
with
one
pair
of
eyes
then
with
another
then
with
a
third
he
next
turned
his
attention
to
tydomin
who
occupied
him
a
still
longer
time
he
replied
at
last
in
a
dry
manly
nervous
voice
i
am
digrung
i
have
arrived
here
from
his
colour
kept
changing
and
maskull
suddenly
realised
of
whom
he
reminded
him
it
was
of
joiwind
perhaps
you
re
going
to
poolingdred
digrung
he
inquired
interested
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
i
can
find
my
way
out
of
this
accursed
possibly
you
are
acquainted
with
joiwind
there
she
s
my
sister
i
m
on
my
way
to
see
her
now
why
do
you

first
country

to
beyond

sinking
what
is

like

yourselves
the
same
old
murders
and
sudden
deaths
are
you
ill
asked
digrung
who
is
this
woman

you
following
at
her
heels
like
a
slave
she
looks
insane

me
what
s
that
are
you
dragging
it
around
the
country
with
you
tydomin
smiled
i
ve
already
heard
it
said
about
matterplay
that
if
one
sows
an
answer
there
a
rich
crop
of
questions
immediately
springs
up
but
why
do
you
make
this
unprovoked
attack
on
me
digrung
i
don
t
attack
you
woman
but
i
know
you
i
see
into
you
and
i
see
insanity
that
wouldn
t
matter
but
i
don
t
like
to
see
a
man
of
intelligence
like
maskull
caught
in
your
filthy
i
suppose
even
you
clever
matterplay
people
sometimes
misjudge
character
however
i
don
t
mind
your
opinion
s
nothing
to
me
digrung
you
d
better
answer
his
questions
maskull
not
for
his
own
your
feminine
friend
is
sure
to
be
curious
about
your
having
been
seen
carrying
a
dead
maskull
s
underlip
shot
out
tell
your
sister
nothing
digrung
don
t
mention
my
name
at
all
i
don
t
want
her
to
know
about
this
meeting
of
why
not
i
don
t
wish
t
that
enough
digrung
looked
impassive
thoughts
and
words
he
said
which
don
t
correspond
with
the
real
events
of
the
world
are
considered
most
shameful
in
i
m
not
asking
you
to
lie
only
to
keep
to
hide
the
truth
is
a
special
branch
of
lying
i
can
t
accede
to
your
wish
i
must
tell
joiwind
everything
as
far
as
i
know
maskull
got
up
and
tydomin
followed
his
example
she
touched
digrung
on
the
arm
and
gave
him
a
strange
look
the
dead
man
is
my
husband
and
maskull
murdered
him
now
you
ll
understand
why
he
wishes
you
to
hold
your
i
guessed
there
was
some
foul
play
said
digrung
it
doesn
t
can
t
falsify
facts
joiwind
must
you
refuse
to
consider
her
feelings
said
maskull
turning
pale
feelings
which
flourish
on
illusions
and
sicken
and
die
on
realities
aren
t
worth
considering
but
joiwind
s
are
not
of
that
if
you
decline
to
do
what
i
ask
at
least
return
home
without
seeing
her
your
sister
will
get
very
little
pleasure
out
of
the
meeting
when
she
hears
your
what
are
these
strange
relations
between
you
demanded
digrung
eying
him
with
suddenly
aroused
suspicion
maskull
stared
back
in
a
sort
of
bewilderment
good
god
you
don
t
doubt
your
own
sister
that
pure
angel
tydomin
caught
hold
of
him
delicately
i
don
t
know
joiwind
but
whoever
she
is
and
whatever
she
s
like
i
know
s
more
fortunate
in
her
friend
than
in
her
brother
now
if
you
really
value
her
happiness
maskull
you
will
have
to
take
some
firm
step
or
i
mean
to
digrung
i
shall
stop
your
if
you
intend
a
second
murder
no
doubt
you
are
big
maskull
turned
around
to
tydomin
and
laughed
i
seem
to
be
leaving
a
wake
of
corpses
behind
me
on
this
why
a
corpse
there
s
no
need
to
kill
thanks
for
that
said
digrung
dryly
all
the
same
some
crime
is
about
to
burst
i
feel
what
must
i
do
then
asked
maskull
it
is
not
my
business
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
not
very
interested
if
i
were
in
your
place
maskull
i
would
not
hesitate
long
don
t
you
understand
how
to
absorb
these
creatures
who
set
their
feeble
obstinate
wills
against
yours
that
is
a
worse
crime
said
maskull
who
knows
he
will
live
but
he
will
tell
no
digrung
laughed
but
changed
colour
i
was
right
then
the
monster
has
sprung
into
the
light
of
maskull
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
have
the
choice
and
we
are
not
joking
do
as
i
you
have
fallen
low
maskull
but
you
are
walking
in
a
dream
and
i
can
t
talk
to
you
as
for
you
must
be
like
a
pleasant
bath
to
you
there
are
strange
ties
between
maskull
and
myself
but
you
are
a
a
foreigner
i
care
nothing
for
nevertheless
i
shall
not
be
frightened
out
of
my
plans
which
are
legitimate
and
do
as
you
please
said
tydomin
if
you
come
to
grief
your
thoughts
will
hardly
have
corresponded
with
the
real
events
of
the
world
which
is
what
you
boast
about
it
is
no
affair
of
i
shall
go
on
and
not
back
exclaimed
digrung
with
angry
emphasis
tydomin
threw
a
swift
evil
smile
at
maskull
bear
witness
that
i
have
tried
to
persuade
this
young
man
now
you
must
come
to
a
quick
decision
in
your
own
mind
as
to
which
is
of
the
greatest
importance
digrung
s
happiness
or
joiwind
s
digrung
won
t
allow
you
to
preserve
them
it
won
t
take
me
long
to
decide
digrung
i
gave
you
a
last
chance
to
change
your
as
long
as
it
s
in
my
power
i
shall
go
on
and
warn
my
sister
against
her
criminal
maskull
again
clutched
at
him
but
this
time
with
violence
instructed
in
his
actions
by
some
new
and
horrible
instinct
he
pressed
the
young
man
tightly
to
his
body
with
all
three
arms
a
feeling
of
wild
sweet
delight
immediately
passed
through
him
then
for
the
first
time
he
comprehended
the
triumphant
joys
of
it
satisfied
the
hunger
of
the
will
exactly
as
food
satisfies
the
hunger
of
the
body
digrung
proved
made
little
opposition
his
personality
passed
slowly
and
evenly
into
maskull
s
the
latter
became
strong
and
gorged
the
victim
gradually
became
paler
and
limper
until
maskull
held
a
corpse
in
his
arms
he
dropped
the
body
and
stood
trembling
he
had
committed
his
second
crime
he
felt
no
immediate
difference
in
his
soul
but
tydomin
shed
a
sad
smile
on
him
like
winter
sunshine
he
half
expected
her
to
speak
but
she
said
nothing
instead
she
made
a
sign
to
him
to
pick
up
crimtyphon
s
corpse
as
he
obeyed
he
wondered
why
digrung
s
dead
face
did
not
wear
the
frightful
crystalman
mask
why
hasn
t
he
altered
he
muttered
to
himself
tydomin
heard
him
she
kicked
digrung
lightly
with
her
little
foot
he
isn
t
s
why
the
expression
you
mean
is
waiting
for
your
then
is
that
my
real
character
she
laughed
softly
you
came
here
to
carve
a
strange
world
and
now
it
appears
you
are
carved
yourself
oh
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
maskull
you
needn
t
stand
there
gaping
you
belong
to
shaping
like
the
rest
of
us
you
are
not
a
king
or
a
since
when
have
i
belonged
to
him
what
does
that
matter
perhaps
since
you
first
breathed
the
air
of
tormance
or
perhaps
since
five
minutes
without
waiting
for
his
response
she
set
off
through
the
copse
and
strode
on
to
the
next
island
maskull
followed
physically
distressed
and
looking
very
grave
the
journey
continued
for
half
an
hour
longer
without
incident
the
character
of
the
scenery
slowly
changed
the
mountaintops
became
loftier
and
more
widely
separated
from
one
another
the
gaps
were
filled
with
rolling
white
clouds
which
bathed
the
shores
of
the
peaks
like
a
mysterious
sea
to
pass
from
island
to
island
was
hard
work
the
intervening
spaces
were
so
however
knew
the
way
the
intense
light
the
sky
the
patches
of
vivid
landscape
emerging
from
the
white
made
a
profound
impression
on
maskull
s
mind
the
glow
of
alppain
was
hidden
by
the
huge
mass
of
disscourn
which
loomed
up
straight
in
front
of
them
the
green
snow
on
the
top
of
the
gigantic
pyramid
had
by
now
completely
melted
away
the
black
gold
and
crimson
of
its
mighty
cliffs
stood
out
with
terrific
brilliance
they
were
directly
beneath
the
bulk
of
the
mountain
which
was
not
a
mile
away
it
did
not
appear
dangerous
to
climb
but
he
was
unaware
on
which
side
of
it
their
destination
lay
it
was
split
from
top
to
bottom
by
numerous
straight
fissures
a
few
waterfalls
descended
here
and
there
like
narrow
motionless
threads
the
face
of
the
mountain
was
rugged
and
bare
it
was
strewn
with
detached
boulders
and
great
jagged
rocks
projected
everywhere
like
iron
teeth
tydomin
pointed
to
a
small
black
hole
near
the
base
which
might
be
a
cave
that
is
where
i
you
live
here
alone
it
s
an
odd
choice
for
a
you
are
not
unbeautiful
a
woman
s
life
is
over
at
she
replied
sighing
and
i
am
far
older
than
that
ten
years
ago
it
would
have
been
i
who
lived
yonder
and
not
oceaxe
then
all
this
wouldn
t
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
stood
within
the
mouth
of
the
cave
it
was
ten
feet
high
and
its
interior
was
impenetrably
black
put
down
the
body
in
the
entrance
out
of
the
sun
directed
tydomin
he
did
so
she
cast
a
keenly
scrutinising
glance
at
him
does
your
resolution
still
hold
maskull
why
shouldn
t
it
hold
my
brains
are
not
follow
me
they
both
stepped
into
the
cave
at
that
very
moment
a
sickening
crash
like
heavy
thunder
just
over
their
heads
set
maskull
s
weakened
heart
thumping
violently
an
avalanche
of
boulders
stones
and
dust
swept
past
the
cave
entrance
from
above
if
their
going
in
had
been
delayed
by
a
single
minute
they
would
have
been
killed
tydomin
did
not
even
look
up
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
started
walking
with
him
into
the
darkness
the
temperature
became
as
cold
as
ice
at
the
first
bend
the
light
from
the
outer
world
disappeared
leaving
them
in
absolute
blackness
maskull
kept
stumbling
over
the
uneven
ground
but
she
kept
tight
hold
of
him
and
hurried
him
along
the
tunnel
seemed
of
interminable
length
presently
however
the
atmosphere
such
was
his
impression
he
was
somehow
led
to
imagine
that
they
had
come
to
a
larger
chamber
here
tydomin
stopped
and
then
forced
him
down
with
quiet
pressure
his
groping
hand
encountered
stone
and
by
feeling
it
all
over
he
discovered
that
it
was
a
sort
of
stone
slab
or
couch
raised
a
foot
or
eighteen
inches
from
the
ground
she
told
him
to
lie
down
has
the
time
come
asked
maskull
he
lay
there
waiting
in
the
darkness
ignorant
of
what
was
going
to
happen
he
felt
her
hand
clasping
his
without
perceiving
any
gradation
he
lost
all
consciousness
of
his
body
he
was
no
longer
able
to
feel
his
limbs
or
internal
organs
his
mind
remained
active
and
alert
nothing
particular
appeared
to
be
taking
place
then
the
chamber
began
to
grow
light
like
very
early
morning
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
retina
of
his
eyes
was
affected
he
fancied
that
he
heard
music
but
while
he
was
listening
for
it
it
stopped
the
light
grew
stronger
the
air
grew
warmer
he
heard
the
confused
sound
of
distant
voices
suddenly
tydomin
gave
his
hand
a
powerful
squeeze
he
heard
someone
scream
faintly
and
then
the
light
leaped
up
and
he
saw
everything
clearly
he
was
lying
on
a
wooden
couch
in
a
strangely
decorated
room
lighted
by
electricity
his
hand
was
being
squeezed
not
by
tydomin
but
by
a
man
dressed
in
the
garments
of
civilisation
with
whose
face
he
was
certainly
familiar
but
under
what
circumstances
he
could
not
recall
other
people
stood
in
the
too
were
vaguely
known
to
him
he
sat
up
and
began
to
smile
without
any
especial
reason
and
then
stood
upright
everybody
seemed
to
be
watching
him
with
anxiety
and
wondered
why
yet
he
felt
that
they
were
all
acquaintances
two
in
particular
he
man
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
who
paced
restlessly
backward
and
forward
his
face
transfigured
by
stern
holy
grandeur
and
that
other
big
bearded
was
himself
was
looking
at
his
own
double
but
it
was
just
as
if
a
man
of
middle
age
were
suddenly
confronted
with
his
own
photograph
as
an
earnest
idealistic
youth
his
other
self
spoke
to
him
he
heard
the
sounds
but
did
not
comprehend
the
sense
then
the
door
was
abruptly
flung
open
and
a
short
looking
individual
leaped
in
he
began
to
behave
in
an
extraordinary
manner
to
everyone
around
him
and
after
that
came
straight
up
to
he
spoke
some
words
but
they
were
incomprehensible
a
terrible
expression
came
over
the
newcomer
s
face
and
he
grasped
his
neck
with
a
pair
of
hairy
hands
maskull
felt
his
bones
bending
and
breaking
excruciating
pains
passed
through
all
the
nerves
of
his
body
and
he
experienced
a
sense
of
impending
death
he
cried
out
and
sank
helplessly
on
the
floor
in
a
heap
the
chamber
and
the
company
light
went
out
once
more
he
found
himself
in
the
blackness
of
the
cave
he
was
this
time
lying
on
the
ground
but
tydomin
was
still
with
him
holding
his
hand
he
was
in
horrible
bodily
agony
but
this
was
only
a
setting
for
the
despairing
anguish
that
filled
his
mind
tydomin
addressed
him
in
tones
of
gentle
reproach
why
are
you
back
so
soon
i
ve
not
had
time
yet
you
must
he
caught
hold
of
her
and
pulled
himself
up
to
his
feet
she
gave
a
low
scream
as
though
in
pain
what
does
this
are
you
doing
maskull
began
maskull
but
the
effort
to
produce
his
words
choked
him
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
stop
of
krag
tell
me
quickly
what
has
happened
free
my
he
gripped
her
arm
tighter
yes
i
ve
seen
krag
i
m
oh
you
are
awake
and
you
must
die
said
maskull
in
an
awful
voice
but
why
what
has
happened
you
must
die
and
i
must
kill
you
because
i
am
awake
and
for
no
other
reason
you
dancing
mistress
tydomin
breathed
hard
for
a
little
time
then
she
seemed
suddenly
to
regain
her
you
won
t
offer
me
violence
surely
in
this
black
cave
no
the
sun
shall
look
on
for
it
is
not
a
murder
but
rest
assured
that
you
must
must
expiate
your
fearful
you
have
already
said
so
and
i
see
you
have
the
power
you
have
escaped
me
it
is
very
curious
well
then
maskull
let
us
come
outside
i
am
not
afraid
but
kill
me
courteously
for
i
have
also
been
courteous
to
you
i
make
no
other
chapter
on
disscourn
by
the
time
that
they
regained
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
blodsombre
was
at
its
height
in
front
of
them
the
scenery
sloped
long
succession
of
mountain
islands
in
a
sea
of
clouds
behind
them
the
bright
stupendous
crags
of
disscourn
loomed
up
for
a
thousand
feet
or
more
maskull
s
eyes
were
red
and
his
face
looked
stupid
he
was
still
holding
the
woman
by
the
arm
she
made
no
attempt
to
speak
or
to
get
away
she
seemed
perfectly
gentle
and
composed
after
gazing
at
the
country
for
a
long
time
in
silence
he
turned
toward
her
whereabouts
is
the
fiery
lake
you
spoke
of
it
lies
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
but
why
do
you
ask
it
is
just
as
well
if
we
have
some
way
to
walk
i
shall
grow
calmer
and
that
s
what
i
want
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
what
is
going
to
happen
is
not
a
murder
but
an
it
will
taste
the
same
said
tydomin
when
i
have
gone
out
of
this
country
i
don
t
wish
to
feel
that
i
have
left
a
demon
behind
me
wandering
at
large
that
would
not
be
fair
to
others
so
we
will
go
to
the
lake
which
promises
an
easy
death
for
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
we
must
wait
till
blodsombre
is
is
this
a
time
for
luxurious
feelings
however
hot
it
is
now
we
will
both
be
cool
by
evening
we
must
start
at
without
doubt
you
are
the
master
maskull
may
i
not
carry
crimtyphon
maskull
looked
at
her
strangely
i
grudge
no
man
his
she
painfully
hoisted
the
body
on
her
narrow
shoulders
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
the
heat
struck
them
like
a
blow
on
the
head
maskull
moved
aside
to
allow
her
to
precede
him
but
no
compassion
entered
his
heart
he
brooded
over
the
wrongs
the
woman
had
done
him
the
way
went
along
the
south
side
of
the
great
pyramid
near
its
base
it
was
a
rough
road
clogged
with
boulders
and
crossed
by
cracks
and
water
gullies
they
could
see
the
water
but
could
not
get
at
it
there
was
no
shade
blisters
formed
on
their
skin
while
all
the
water
in
their
blood
seemed
to
dry
up
maskull
forgot
his
own
tortures
in
his
devil
s
delight
at
tydomin
s
sing
me
a
song
he
called
out
presently
a
characteristic
she
turned
her
head
and
gave
him
a
long
peculiar
look
then
without
any
sort
of
expostulation
started
singing
her
voice
was
low
and
weird
the
song
was
so
extraordinary
that
he
had
to
rub
his
eyes
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
the
slow
surprises
of
the
grotesque
melody
began
to
agitate
him
in
a
horrible
fashion
the
words
were
pure
else
their
significance
was
too
deep
for
him
where
in
the
name
of
all
unholy
things
did
you
acquire
that
stuff
woman
tydomin
shed
a
sickly
smile
while
the
corpse
swayed
about
with
ghastly
jerks
over
her
left
shoulder
she
held
it
in
position
with
her
two
left
arms
it
s
a
pity
we
could
not
have
met
as
friends
maskull
i
could
have
shown
you
a
side
of
tormance
which
now
perhaps
you
will
never
see
the
wild
mad
side
but
now
it
s
too
late
and
it
doesn
t
they
turned
the
angle
of
the
mountain
and
started
to
traverse
the
western
base
which
is
the
quickest
way
out
of
this
miserable
land
asked
maskull
it
is
easiest
to
go
to
will
we
see
it
from
anywhere
yes
though
it
is
a
long
way
have
you
been
there
i
am
a
woman
and
true
i
have
heard
something
of
the
but
don
t
ask
me
any
more
questions
said
tydomin
who
was
becoming
faint
maskull
stopped
at
a
little
spring
he
himself
drank
and
then
made
a
cup
of
his
hand
for
the
woman
so
that
she
might
not
have
to
lay
down
her
burden
the
gnawl
water
acted
like
seemed
to
replenish
all
the
cells
of
his
body
as
though
they
had
been
thirsty
sponge
pores
sucking
up
liquid
tydomin
recovered
her
about
of
an
hour
later
they
worked
around
the
second
corner
and
entered
into
full
view
of
the
north
aspect
of
disscourn
a
hundred
yards
lower
down
the
slope
on
which
they
were
walking
the
mountain
ended
abruptly
in
a
chasm
the
air
above
it
was
filled
with
a
sort
of
green
haze
which
trembled
violently
like
the
atmosphere
immediately
over
a
furnace
the
lake
is
underneath
said
tydomin
maskull
looked
curiously
about
him
beyond
the
crater
the
country
sloped
away
in
a
continuous
descent
to
the
skyline
behind
them
a
narrow
path
channelled
its
way
up
through
the
rocks
toward
the
towering
summit
of
the
pyramid
miles
away
in
the
quarter
a
long
plateau
raised
its
head
far
above
all
the
surrounding
country
it
was
there
and
then
he
made
up
his
mind
that
that
should
be
his
destination
that
day
tydomin
meanwhile
had
walked
straight
to
the
gulf
and
set
down
crimtyphon
s
body
on
the
edge
in
a
minute
or
two
maskull
joined
her
arrived
at
the
brink
he
immediately
flung
himself
at
full
length
on
his
chest
to
see
what
could
be
seen
of
the
lake
of
fire
a
gust
of
hot
asphyxiating
air
smote
his
face
and
set
him
coughing
but
he
did
not
get
up
until
he
had
stared
his
fill
at
the
huge
sea
of
green
molten
lava
tossing
and
swirling
at
no
great
distance
below
like
a
living
will
a
faint
sound
of
drumming
came
up
he
listened
intently
and
as
he
did
so
his
heart
quickened
and
the
black
cares
rolled
away
from
his
soul
all
the
world
and
its
accidents
seemed
at
that
moment
false
and
without
meaning
he
climbed
abstractedly
to
his
feet
tydomin
was
talking
to
her
dead
husband
she
was
peering
into
the
hideous
face
of
ivory
and
fondling
his
violet
hair
when
she
perceived
maskull
she
hastily
kissed
the
withered
lips
and
got
up
from
her
knees
lifting
the
corpse
with
all
three
arms
she
staggered
with
it
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
gulf
and
after
an
instant
s
hesitation
allowed
it
to
drop
into
the
lava
it
disappeared
immediately
without
sound
a
metallic
splash
came
up
that
was
crimtyphon
s
funeral
now
i
am
ready
he
did
not
answer
but
stared
past
her
another
figure
was
standing
erect
and
mournful
not
far
behind
her
it
was
joiwind
her
face
was
wan
and
there
was
an
accusing
look
in
her
eyes
maskull
knew
that
it
was
a
phantasm
and
that
the
real
joiwind
was
miles
away
at
poolingdred
turn
around
tydomin
he
said
oddly
and
tell
me
what
you
see
behind
i
don
t
see
anything
she
answered
looking
around
but
i
see
just
as
he
was
speaking
the
apparition
vanished
now
i
present
you
with
your
life
tydomin
she
wishes
the
woman
fingered
her
chin
thoughtfully
i
little
expected
i
should
ever
be
beholden
for
my
life
to
one
of
my
own
so
be
it
what
really
happened
to
you
in
my
cavern
i
really
saw
yes
some
miracle
must
have
taken
she
suddenly
shivered
come
let
us
leave
this
horrible
spot
i
shall
never
come
here
yes
said
maskull
it
stinks
of
death
and
dying
but
where
are
we
to
are
we
to
do
take
me
to
sant
i
must
get
away
from
this
hellish
tydomin
remained
standing
dull
and
then
she
gave
an
abrupt
bitter
little
laugh
we
make
our
journey
together
in
singular
stages
rather
than
be
alone
i
ll
come
with
you
know
that
if
i
set
foot
in
sant
they
will
kill
at
least
set
me
on
the
way
i
wish
to
get
there
before
night
is
it
possible
if
you
are
willing
to
take
risks
with
nature
and
why
should
you
not
take
risks
today
your
luck
holds
but
someday
or
other
it
won
t
let
us
start
said
maskull
the
luck
i
ve
had
so
far
is
nothing
to
brag
blodsombre
was
over
when
they
set
off
it
was
early
afternoon
but
the
heat
seemed
more
stifling
than
ever
they
made
no
more
pretence
at
conversation
both
were
buried
in
their
own
painful
thoughts
the
land
fell
away
from
disscourn
in
all
other
directions
but
toward
sant
there
was
a
gentle
persistent
rise
its
dark
distant
plateau
continued
to
dominate
the
landscape
and
after
walking
for
an
hour
they
seemed
none
the
nearer
to
it
the
air
was
stale
and
stagnant
by
and
by
an
upright
object
apparently
the
work
of
man
attracted
maskull
s
notice
it
was
a
slender
tree
stem
with
the
bark
still
on
imbedded
in
the
stony
ground
from
the
upper
end
three
branches
sprang
out
pointing
aloft
at
a
sharp
angle
they
were
stripped
to
twigs
and
leaves
and
getting
closer
he
saw
that
they
had
been
artificially
fastened
on
at
equal
distances
from
each
other
as
he
stared
at
the
object
a
strange
sudden
flush
of
confident
vanity
and
seemed
to
pass
through
him
but
it
was
so
momentary
that
he
could
be
sure
of
nothing
what
may
that
be
tydomin
it
is
hator
s
and
what
is
its
purpose
it
s
a
guide
to
but
who
or
what
is
hator
hator
was
the
founder
of
thousands
of
years
ago
he
laid
down
the
principles
they
all
live
by
and
that
trifork
is
his
symbol
when
i
was
a
little
child
my
father
told
me
the
legends
but
i
ve
forgotten
most
of
maskull
regarded
it
attentively
does
it
affect
you
in
any
way
and
why
should
it
do
that
she
said
dropping
her
lip
scornfully
i
am
only
a
woman
and
these
are
masculine
a
sort
of
gladness
came
over
me
said
maskull
but
perhaps
i
am
they
passed
on
the
scenery
gradually
changed
in
character
the
solid
parts
of
the
land
grew
more
continuous
the
fissures
became
narrower
and
more
infrequent
there
were
now
no
more
subsidences
or
upheavals
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
ifdawn
marest
appeared
to
be
giving
place
to
a
different
order
of
things
later
on
they
encountered
a
flock
of
pale
blue
jellies
floating
in
the
air
they
were
miniature
animals
tydomin
caught
one
in
her
hand
and
began
to
eat
it
just
as
one
eats
a
luscious
pear
plucked
from
a
tree
maskull
who
had
fasted
since
early
morning
was
not
slow
in
following
her
example
a
sort
of
electric
vigour
at
once
entered
his
limbs
and
body
his
muscles
regained
their
elasticity
his
heart
began
to
beat
with
hard
slow
strong
throbs
food
and
body
seem
to
agree
well
in
this
world
he
remarked
smiling
she
glanced
toward
him
perhaps
the
explanation
is
not
in
the
food
but
in
your
i
brought
my
body
with
you
brought
your
soul
with
you
but
that
s
altering
fast
in
a
copse
they
came
across
a
short
wide
tree
without
leaves
but
possessing
a
multitude
of
thin
flexible
branches
like
the
tentacles
of
a
cuttlefish
some
of
these
branches
were
moving
rapidly
a
furry
animal
somewhat
resembling
a
wildcat
leaped
about
among
them
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
but
the
next
minute
maskull
was
shocked
to
realise
that
the
beast
was
not
leaping
at
all
but
was
being
thrown
from
branch
to
branch
by
the
volition
of
the
tree
exactly
as
an
imprisoned
mouse
is
thrown
by
a
cat
from
paw
to
paw
he
watched
the
spectacle
a
while
with
morbid
interest
that
s
a
gruesome
reversal
of
rôles
one
can
see
you
re
disgusted
she
replied
stifling
a
yawn
but
that
is
because
you
are
a
slave
to
words
if
you
called
that
plant
an
animal
you
would
find
its
occupation
perfectly
natural
and
pleasing
and
why
should
you
not
call
it
an
animal
i
am
quite
aware
that
as
long
as
i
remain
in
the
ifdawn
marest
i
shall
go
on
listening
to
this
sort
of
they
trudged
along
for
an
hour
or
more
without
talking
the
day
became
overcast
a
thin
mist
began
to
shroud
the
landscape
and
the
sun
changed
into
an
immense
ruddy
disk
which
could
be
stared
at
without
flinching
a
chill
damp
wind
blew
against
them
presently
it
grew
still
darker
the
sun
disappeared
and
glancing
first
at
his
companion
and
then
at
himself
maskull
noticed
that
their
skin
and
clothing
were
coated
by
a
kind
of
green
hoarfrost
the
land
was
now
completely
solid
about
half
a
mile
in
front
of
them
against
a
background
of
dark
fog
a
moving
forest
of
tall
waterspouts
gyrated
slowly
and
gracefully
hither
and
thither
they
were
green
and
and
looked
terrifying
tydomin
explained
that
they
were
not
waterspouts
at
all
but
mobile
columns
of
lightning
then
they
are
dangerous
so
we
think
she
answered
watching
them
closely
someone
is
wandering
there
who
appears
to
have
a
different
among
the
spouts
and
entirely
encompassed
by
them
a
man
was
walking
with
a
slow
calm
composed
gait
his
back
turned
toward
maskull
and
tydomin
there
was
something
unusual
in
his
form
looked
extraordinarily
distinct
solid
and
real
if
there
s
danger
he
ought
to
be
warned
said
maskull
he
who
is
always
anxious
to
teach
will
learn
nothing
returned
the
woman
coolly
she
restrained
maskull
by
a
pressure
of
the
arm
and
continued
to
watch
the
base
of
one
of
the
columns
touched
the
man
he
remained
unharmed
but
turned
sharply
around
as
if
for
the
first
time
made
aware
of
the
proximity
of
these
deadly
waltzers
then
he
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
and
stretched
both
arms
aloft
above
his
head
like
a
diver
he
seemed
to
be
addressing
the
columns
while
they
looked
on
the
electric
spouts
discharged
themselves
with
a
series
of
loud
explosions
the
stranger
stood
alone
uninjured
he
dropped
his
arms
the
next
moment
he
caught
sight
of
the
two
and
stood
still
waiting
for
them
to
come
up
the
pictorial
clarity
of
his
person
grew
more
and
more
noticeable
as
they
approached
his
body
seemed
to
be
composed
of
some
substance
heavier
and
denser
than
solid
matter
tydomin
looked
perplexed
he
must
be
a
sant
man
i
have
seen
no
one
quite
like
him
before
this
is
a
day
of
days
for
he
must
be
an
individual
of
great
importance
murmured
maskull
they
now
came
up
to
him
he
was
tall
strong
and
bearded
and
was
clothed
in
a
shirt
and
breeches
of
skin
since
turning
his
back
to
the
wind
the
green
deposit
on
his
face
and
limbs
had
changed
to
streaming
moisture
through
which
his
natural
colour
was
visible
it
was
that
of
pale
iron
there
was
no
third
arm
his
face
was
harsh
and
frowning
and
a
projecting
chin
pushed
the
beard
forward
on
his
forehead
there
were
two
flat
membranes
like
rudimentary
eyes
but
no
sorb
these
membranes
were
expressionless
but
in
some
strange
way
seemed
to
add
vigour
to
the
stern
eyes
underneath
when
his
glance
rested
on
maskull
the
latter
felt
as
though
his
brain
were
being
thoroughly
travelled
through
the
man
was
his
physical
distinctness
transcended
nature
by
contrast
with
him
every
object
in
the
neighbourhood
looked
vague
and
blurred
tydomin
s
person
suddenly
appeared
faint
without
significance
and
maskull
realised
that
it
was
no
better
with
himself
a
queer
quickening
fire
began
running
through
his
veins
he
turned
to
the
woman
if
this
man
is
going
to
sant
i
shall
bear
him
company
we
can
now
part
no
doubt
you
will
think
it
high
let
tydomin
come
the
words
were
delivered
in
a
rough
foreign
tongue
but
were
as
intelligible
to
maskull
as
if
spoken
in
english
you
who
know
my
name
also
know
my
sex
said
tydomin
quietly
it
is
death
for
me
to
enter
that
is
the
old
law
i
am
the
bearer
of
the
new
is
it
will
it
be
accepted
the
old
skin
is
cracking
the
new
skin
has
been
silently
forming
underneath
the
moment
of
sloughing
has
the
storm
gathered
the
green
snow
drove
against
them
as
they
stood
talking
and
it
grew
intensely
cold
none
noticed
it
what
is
your
name
asked
maskull
with
a
beating
heart
my
name
maskull
is
spadevil
you
a
voyager
across
the
dark
ocean
of
space
shall
be
my
first
witness
and
follower
you
tydomin
a
daughter
of
the
despised
sex
shall
be
my
the
new
law
but
what
is
it
until
eye
sees
of
what
use
it
is
for
ear
to
hear
come
both
of
you
to
me
tydomin
went
to
him
unhesitatingly
spadevil
pressed
his
hand
on
her
sorb
and
kept
it
there
for
a
few
minutes
while
he
closed
his
own
eyes
when
he
removed
it
maskull
observed
that
the
sorb
was
transformed
into
twin
membranes
like
spadevil
s
own
tydomin
looked
dazed
she
glanced
quietly
about
for
a
little
while
apparently
testing
her
new
faculty
then
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
and
snatching
up
spadevil
s
hand
she
bent
over
and
kissed
it
hurriedly
many
times
my
past
has
been
bad
she
said
numbers
have
received
harm
from
me
and
none
good
i
have
worse
but
now
i
can
throw
all
that
away
and
laugh
nothing
can
now
injure
me
oh
maskull
you
and
i
have
been
fools
together
don
t
you
repent
your
crimes
asked
maskull
leave
the
past
alone
said
spadevil
it
can
not
be
reshaped
the
future
alone
is
ours
it
starts
fresh
and
clean
from
this
very
minute
why
do
you
hesitate
maskull
are
you
afraid
what
is
the
name
of
those
organs
and
what
is
their
function
they
are
probes
and
they
are
the
gates
opening
into
a
new
maskull
lingered
no
longer
but
permitted
spadevil
to
cover
his
sorb
while
the
iron
hand
was
still
pressing
his
forehead
the
new
law
quietly
flowed
into
his
consciousness
like
a
stream
of
clean
water
which
had
hitherto
been
dammed
by
his
obstructive
will
the
law
was
duty
chapter
spadevil
maskull
found
that
his
new
organs
had
no
independent
function
of
their
own
but
only
intensified
and
altered
his
other
senses
when
he
used
his
eyes
ears
or
nostrils
the
same
objects
presented
themselves
to
him
but
his
judgment
concerning
them
was
different
previously
all
external
things
had
existed
for
him
now
he
existed
for
them
according
to
whether
they
served
his
purpose
or
were
in
harmony
with
his
nature
or
otherwise
they
had
been
pleasant
or
painful
now
these
words
pleasure
and
pain
simply
had
no
meaning
the
other
two
watched
him
while
he
was
making
himself
acquainted
with
his
new
mental
outlook
he
smiled
at
them
you
were
quite
right
tydomin
he
said
in
a
bold
cheerful
voice
we
have
been
fools
so
near
the
light
all
the
time
and
we
never
guessed
it
always
buried
in
the
past
or
ignoring
the
now
it
turns
out
that
apart
from
the
present
we
have
no
life
at
thank
spadevil
for
it
she
answered
more
loudly
than
usual
maskull
looked
at
the
man
s
dark
concrete
form
spadevil
now
i
mean
to
follow
you
to
the
end
i
can
do
nothing
the
severe
face
showed
no
sign
of
a
muscle
relaxed
watch
that
you
don
t
lose
your
gift
he
said
gruffly
tydomin
spoke
you
promised
that
i
should
enter
sant
with
attach
yourself
to
the
truth
not
to
me
for
i
may
die
before
you
but
the
truth
will
accompany
you
to
your
death
however
now
let
us
journey
together
all
three
of
the
words
had
not
left
his
mouth
before
he
put
his
face
against
the
fine
driving
snow
and
pressed
onward
toward
his
destination
he
walked
with
a
long
stride
tydomin
was
obliged
to
half
run
in
order
to
keep
up
with
him
the
three
travelled
abreast
spadevil
in
the
middle
the
fog
was
so
dense
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
a
hundred
yards
ahead
the
ground
was
covered
by
the
green
snow
the
wind
blew
in
gusts
from
the
sant
highlands
and
was
piercingly
cold
spadevil
are
you
a
man
or
more
than
a
man
asked
maskull
he
that
is
not
more
than
a
man
is
where
have
you
now
come
from
from
brooding
maskull
out
of
no
other
mother
can
truth
be
born
i
have
brooded
and
rejected
and
i
have
brooded
again
now
after
many
months
absence
from
sant
the
truth
at
last
shines
forth
for
me
in
its
simple
splendour
like
an
upturned
i
see
its
shining
said
maskull
but
how
much
does
it
owe
to
ancient
hator
knowledge
has
its
seasons
the
blossom
was
to
hator
the
fruit
is
to
me
hator
also
was
a
now
his
followers
do
not
brood
in
sant
all
is
icy
selfishness
a
living
death
they
hate
pleasure
and
this
hatred
is
the
greatest
pleasure
to
but
in
what
way
have
they
fallen
off
from
hator
s
doctrines
for
him
in
his
sullen
purity
of
nature
all
the
world
was
a
snare
a
limed
twig
knowing
that
pleasure
was
everywhere
a
fierce
mocking
enemy
crouching
and
waiting
at
every
corner
of
the
road
of
life
in
order
to
kill
with
its
sweet
sting
the
naked
grandeur
of
the
soul
he
shielded
himself
behind
pain
this
also
his
followers
do
but
they
do
not
do
it
for
the
sake
of
the
soul
but
for
the
sake
of
vanity
and
what
is
the
trifork
the
stem
maskull
is
hatred
of
pleasure
the
first
fork
is
disentanglement
from
the
sweetness
of
the
world
the
second
fork
is
power
over
those
who
still
writhe
in
the
nets
of
illusion
the
third
fork
is
the
healthy
glow
of
one
who
steps
into
from
what
land
did
hator
come
it
is
not
said
he
lived
in
ifdawn
for
a
while
there
are
many
legends
told
of
him
while
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
said
tydomin
relate
some
of
these
legends
the
snow
had
ceased
the
day
brightened
branchspell
reappeared
like
a
phantom
sun
but
bitter
blasts
of
wind
still
swept
over
the
plain
in
those
days
said
spadevil
there
existed
in
ifdawn
a
mountain
island
separated
by
wide
spaces
from
the
land
around
it
a
handsome
girl
who
knew
sorcery
caused
a
bridge
to
be
constructed
across
which
men
and
women
might
pass
to
it
having
by
a
false
tale
drawn
hator
on
to
this
rock
she
pushed
at
the
bridge
with
her
foot
until
it
tumbled
into
the
depths
below
you
and
i
hator
are
now
together
and
there
is
no
means
of
separating
i
wish
to
see
how
long
the
famous
frost
man
can
withstand
the
breath
smiles
and
perfume
of
a
hator
said
no
word
either
then
or
all
that
day
he
stood
till
sunset
like
a
tree
trunk
and
thought
of
other
things
then
the
girl
grew
passionate
and
shook
her
curls
she
rose
from
where
she
was
sitting
she
looked
at
him
and
touched
his
arm
but
he
did
not
see
her
she
looked
at
him
so
that
all
the
soul
was
in
her
eyes
and
then
she
fell
down
dead
hator
awoke
from
his
thoughts
and
saw
her
lying
still
warm
at
his
feet
a
corpse
he
passed
to
the
mainland
but
how
it
is
not
tydomin
shuddered
you
too
have
met
your
wicked
woman
spadevil
but
your
method
is
a
nobler
don
t
pity
other
women
said
spadevil
but
love
the
right
hator
also
once
conversed
with
with
the
maker
of
the
world
said
maskull
thoughtfully
with
the
maker
of
pleasure
it
is
told
how
shaping
defended
his
world
and
tried
to
force
hator
to
acknowledge
loveliness
and
joy
but
hator
answering
all
his
marvellous
speeches
in
a
few
concise
iron
words
showed
how
this
joy
and
beauty
was
but
another
name
for
the
bestiality
of
souls
wallowing
in
luxury
and
sloth
shaping
smiled
and
said
how
comes
it
that
your
wisdom
is
greater
than
that
of
the
master
of
wisdom
hator
said
my
wisdom
does
not
come
from
you
nor
from
your
world
but
from
that
other
world
which
you
shaping
have
vainly
tried
to
shaping
replied
what
then
do
you
do
in
my
world
hator
said
i
am
here
falsely
and
therefore
i
am
subject
to
your
false
pleasures
but
i
wrap
myself
in
because
it
is
good
but
because
i
wish
to
keep
myself
as
far
from
you
as
possible
for
pain
is
not
yours
neither
does
it
belong
to
the
other
world
but
it
is
the
shadow
cast
by
your
false
shaping
then
said
what
is
this
faraway
other
world
of
which
you
say
this
is
is
not
so
how
happens
it
that
you
alone
of
all
my
creatures
have
knowledge
of
it
but
hator
spat
at
his
feet
and
said
you
lie
shaping
all
have
knowledge
of
it
you
with
your
pretty
toys
alone
obscure
it
from
our
shaping
asked
what
then
am
i
hator
answered
you
are
the
dreamer
of
impossible
and
then
the
story
goes
that
shaping
departed
ill
pleased
with
what
had
been
what
other
world
did
hator
refer
to
asked
maskull
one
where
grandeur
reigns
maskull
just
as
pleasure
reigns
whether
grandeur
or
pleasure
it
makes
no
difference
said
maskull
the
individual
spirit
that
lives
and
wishes
to
live
is
mean
and
guard
you
your
pride
returned
spadevil
do
not
make
law
for
the
universe
and
for
all
time
but
for
yourself
and
for
this
small
false
life
of
in
what
shape
did
death
come
to
that
hard
unconquerable
man
asked
tydomin
he
lived
to
be
old
but
went
upright
and
to
his
last
hour
when
he
saw
that
death
could
not
be
staved
off
longer
he
determined
to
destroy
himself
he
gathered
his
friends
around
him
not
from
vanity
but
that
they
might
see
to
what
lengths
the
human
soul
can
go
in
its
perpetual
warfare
with
the
voluptuous
body
standing
erect
without
support
he
died
by
withholding
his
a
silence
followed
which
lasted
for
perhaps
an
hour
their
minds
refused
to
acknowledge
the
icy
winds
but
the
current
of
their
thoughts
became
frozen
when
branchspell
however
shone
out
again
though
with
subdued
power
maskull
s
curiosity
rose
once
more
your
fellow
countrymen
then
spadevil
are
sick
with
the
men
of
other
countries
said
spadevil
are
the
slaves
of
pleasure
and
desire
knowing
it
but
the
men
of
my
country
are
the
slaves
of
pleasure
and
desire
not
knowing
and
yet
that
proud
pleasure
which
rejoices
in
has
something
noble
in
he
who
studies
himself
at
all
is
ignoble
only
by
despising
soul
as
well
as
body
can
a
man
enter
into
true
on
what
grounds
do
they
reject
women
inasmuch
as
a
woman
has
ideal
love
and
can
not
live
for
herself
love
for
another
is
pleasure
for
the
loved
one
and
therefore
injurious
to
a
forest
of
false
ideas
is
waiting
for
your
axe
said
maskull
but
will
they
allow
it
spadevil
knows
maskull
said
tydomin
that
be
it
today
or
be
it
tomorrow
love
can
t
be
kept
out
of
a
land
even
by
the
disciples
of
beware
of
of
emotion
exclaimed
spadevil
love
is
but
pleasure
once
removed
think
not
of
pleasing
others
but
of
serving
forgive
me
spadevil
if
i
am
still
right
has
no
sex
so
long
tydomin
as
you
remember
that
you
are
a
woman
so
long
you
will
not
enter
into
divine
apathy
of
but
where
there
are
no
women
there
are
no
children
said
maskull
how
came
there
to
be
all
these
generations
of
hator
men
life
breeds
passion
passion
breeds
suffering
suffering
breeds
the
yearning
for
relief
from
suffering
men
throng
to
sant
from
all
parts
in
order
to
have
the
scars
of
their
souls
in
place
of
hatred
of
pleasure
which
all
can
understand
what
simple
formula
do
you
offer
iron
obedience
to
duty
answered
spadevil
and
if
they
ask
how
far
is
this
consistent
with
hatred
of
pleasure
what
will
your
pronouncement
be
i
do
not
answer
them
but
i
answer
you
maskull
who
ask
the
question
hatred
is
passion
and
all
passion
springs
from
the
dark
fires
of
self
do
not
hate
pleasure
at
all
but
pass
it
by
on
one
side
calm
and
what
is
the
criterion
of
pleasure
how
can
we
always
recognise
it
in
order
to
avoid
it
rigidly
follow
duty
and
such
questions
will
not
later
in
the
afternoon
tydomin
timidly
placed
her
fingers
on
spadevil
s
arm
fearful
doubts
are
in
my
mind
she
said
this
expedition
to
sant
may
turn
out
badly
i
have
seen
a
vision
of
you
spadevil
and
myself
lying
dead
and
covered
in
blood
but
maskull
was
not
we
may
drop
the
torch
but
it
will
not
be
extinguished
and
others
will
raise
show
me
a
sign
that
you
are
not
as
other
that
i
may
know
that
our
blood
will
not
be
spadevil
regarded
her
sternly
i
am
not
a
magician
i
don
t
persuade
the
senses
but
the
soul
does
your
duty
call
you
to
sant
tydomin
then
go
there
does
it
not
call
you
to
sant
then
go
no
farther
is
not
this
simple
what
signs
are
necessary
did
i
not
see
you
dispel
those
spouts
of
lightning
no
common
man
could
have
done
who
knows
what
any
man
can
do
this
man
can
do
one
thing
that
man
can
do
another
but
what
all
men
can
do
is
their
duty
and
to
open
their
eyes
to
this
i
must
go
to
sant
and
if
necessary
lay
down
my
life
will
you
not
still
accompany
me
yes
said
tydomin
i
will
follow
you
to
the
end
it
is
all
the
more
essential
because
i
keep
on
displeasing
you
with
my
remarks
and
that
means
i
have
not
yet
learned
my
lesson
do
not
be
humble
for
humility
is
only
and
while
we
are
thinking
of
self
we
must
be
neglecting
some
action
we
could
be
planning
or
shaping
in
our
tydomin
continued
to
be
uneasy
and
preoccupied
why
was
maskull
not
in
the
picture
she
asked
you
dwell
on
this
foreboding
because
you
imagine
it
is
tragical
there
is
nothing
tragical
in
death
tydomin
nor
in
life
there
is
only
right
and
wrong
what
arises
from
right
or
wrong
action
does
not
matter
we
are
not
gods
constructing
a
world
but
simple
men
and
women
doing
our
immediate
duty
we
may
die
in
you
have
seen
it
but
the
truth
will
go
on
spadevil
why
do
you
choose
sant
to
start
your
work
in
asked
maskull
these
men
with
fixed
ideas
seem
to
me
the
least
likely
of
any
to
follow
a
new
where
a
bad
tree
thrives
a
good
tree
will
flourish
but
where
no
tree
at
all
can
be
found
nothing
will
i
understand
you
said
maskull
here
perhaps
we
are
going
to
martyrdom
but
elsewhere
we
should
resemble
men
preaching
to
shortly
before
sunset
they
arrived
at
the
extremity
of
the
upland
plain
above
which
towered
the
black
cliffs
of
the
sant
levels
a
dizzy
artificially
constructed
staircase
of
more
than
a
thousand
steps
of
varying
depth
twisting
and
forking
in
order
to
conform
to
the
angles
of
the
precipices
led
to
the
world
overhead
in
the
place
where
they
stood
they
were
sheltered
from
the
cutting
winds
branchspell
radiantly
shining
at
last
but
on
the
point
of
sinking
filled
the
cloudy
sky
with
violent
lurid
colors
some
of
the
combinations
of
which
were
new
to
maskull
the
circle
of
the
horizon
was
so
gigantic
that
had
he
been
suddenly
carried
back
to
earth
he
would
by
comparison
have
fancied
himself
to
be
moving
beneath
the
dome
of
some
little
cathedral
he
realised
that
he
was
on
a
foreign
planet
but
he
was
not
stirred
or
uplifted
by
the
knowledge
he
was
conscious
only
of
moral
ideas
looking
backward
he
saw
the
plain
which
for
several
miles
past
had
been
without
vegetation
stretching
back
away
to
disscourn
so
regular
had
been
the
ascent
and
so
great
was
the
distance
that
the
huge
pyramid
looked
nothing
more
than
a
slight
swelling
on
the
face
of
the
earth
spadevil
stopped
and
gazed
over
the
landscape
in
silence
in
the
evening
sunlight
his
form
looked
more
dense
dark
and
real
than
ever
before
his
features
were
set
hard
in
grimness
he
turned
around
to
his
companions
what
is
the
greatest
wonder
in
all
this
wonderful
scene
he
demanded
acquaint
us
said
maskull
all
that
you
see
is
born
from
pleasure
and
moves
on
from
pleasure
to
pleasure
nowhere
is
right
to
be
found
it
is
shaping
s
there
is
another
wonder
said
tydomin
and
she
pointed
her
finger
toward
the
sky
overhead
a
small
cloud
so
low
down
that
it
was
perhaps
not
more
than
five
hundred
feet
above
them
was
sailing
along
in
front
of
the
dark
wall
of
cliff
it
was
in
the
exact
shape
of
an
open
human
hand
with
pointing
fingers
it
was
stained
crimson
by
the
sun
and
one
or
two
tiny
cloudlets
beneath
the
fingers
looked
like
falling
drops
of
blood
who
can
doubt
now
that
our
death
is
close
at
hand
said
tydomin
i
have
been
close
to
death
twice
today
the
first
time
i
was
ready
but
now
i
am
more
ready
for
i
shall
die
side
by
side
with
the
man
who
has
given
me
my
first
do
not
think
of
death
but
of
right
persistence
replied
spadevil
i
am
not
here
to
tremble
before
shaping
s
portents
but
to
snatch
men
from
he
at
once
proceeded
to
lead
the
way
up
the
staircase
tydomin
gazed
upward
after
him
for
a
moment
with
an
odd
worshiping
light
in
her
eyes
then
she
followed
him
the
second
of
the
party
maskull
climbed
last
he
was
travel
stained
unkempt
and
very
tired
but
his
soul
was
at
peace
as
they
steadily
ascended
the
almost
perpendicular
stairs
the
sun
got
higher
in
the
sky
its
light
dyed
their
bodies
a
ruddy
gold
they
gained
the
top
there
they
found
rolling
in
front
of
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
a
barren
desert
of
white
sand
broken
here
and
there
by
large
jagged
masses
of
black
rock
tracts
of
the
sand
were
reddened
by
the
sinking
sun
the
vast
expanse
of
sky
was
filled
by
shaped
clouds
and
wild
colors
the
freezing
wind
flurrying
across
the
desert
drove
the
fine
particles
of
sand
painfully
against
their
faces
where
now
do
you
take
us
asked
maskull
he
who
guards
the
old
wisdom
of
sant
must
give
up
that
wisdom
to
me
that
i
may
change
it
what
he
says
others
will
say
i
go
to
find
and
where
will
you
seek
him
in
this
bare
country
spadevil
struck
off
toward
the
north
unhesitatingly
it
is
not
so
far
he
said
it
is
his
custom
to
be
in
that
part
where
sant
overhangs
the
wombflash
forest
perhaps
he
will
be
there
but
i
can
not
maskull
glanced
toward
tydomin
her
sunken
cheeks
and
the
dark
circles
beneath
her
eyes
told
of
her
extreme
weariness
the
woman
is
tired
spadevil
he
said
she
smiled
it
s
but
another
step
into
the
land
of
death
i
can
manage
it
give
me
your
arm
he
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
supported
her
along
that
way
the
sun
is
now
sinking
said
maskull
will
we
get
there
before
dark
fear
nothing
maskull
and
tydomin
this
pain
is
eating
up
the
evil
in
your
nature
the
road
you
are
walking
can
not
remain
unwalked
we
shall
arrive
before
the
sun
then
disappeared
behind
the
ridges
that
formed
the
western
boundary
of
the
ifdawn
marest
the
sky
blazed
up
into
more
vivid
colors
the
wind
grew
colder
they
passed
some
pools
of
colourless
gnawl
water
round
the
banks
of
which
were
planted
fruit
trees
maskull
ate
some
of
the
fruit
it
was
hard
bitter
and
astringent
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
taste
but
he
felt
braced
and
invigorated
by
the
juices
no
other
trees
or
shrubs
were
to
be
seen
anywhere
no
animals
appeared
no
birds
or
insects
it
was
a
desolate
land
a
mile
or
two
passed
when
they
again
approached
the
edge
of
the
plateau
far
down
beneath
their
feet
the
great
wombflash
forest
began
but
daylight
had
vanished
there
maskull
s
eyes
rested
only
on
a
vague
darkness
he
faintly
heard
what
sounded
like
the
distant
sighing
of
innumerable
treetops
in
the
rapidly
darkening
twilight
they
came
abruptly
on
a
man
he
was
standing
in
a
pool
on
one
leg
a
pile
of
boulders
had
hidden
him
from
their
view
the
water
came
as
far
up
as
his
calf
a
trifork
similar
to
the
one
maskull
had
seen
on
disscourn
but
smaller
had
been
stuck
in
the
mud
close
by
his
hand
they
stopped
by
the
side
of
the
pond
and
waited
immediately
he
became
aware
of
their
presence
the
man
set
down
his
other
leg
and
waded
out
of
the
water
toward
them
picking
up
his
trifork
in
doing
so
this
is
not
maulger
but
catice
said
spadevil
maulger
is
dead
said
catice
speaking
the
same
tongue
as
spadevil
but
with
an
even
harsher
accent
so
that
the
tympanum
of
maskull
s
ear
was
affected
painfully
the
latter
saw
before
him
a
bowed
powerful
individual
advanced
in
years
he
wore
nothing
but
a
scanty
loincloth
his
trunk
was
long
and
heavy
but
his
legs
were
rather
short
his
face
was
beardless
coloured
and
it
was
disfigured
by
a
number
of
longitudinal
ruts
a
quarter
of
an
inch
deep
the
cavities
of
which
seemed
clogged
with
ancient
dirt
the
hair
of
his
head
was
black
and
sparse
instead
of
the
twin
membranous
organs
of
spadevil
he
possessed
but
one
and
this
was
in
the
centre
of
his
brow
spadevil
s
dark
solid
person
stood
out
from
the
rest
like
a
reality
among
dreams
has
the
trifork
passed
to
you
he
demanded
yes
why
have
you
brought
this
woman
to
sant
i
have
brought
another
thing
to
sant
i
have
brought
the
new
catice
stood
motionless
and
looked
troubled
state
shall
i
speak
with
many
words
or
few
words
if
you
wish
to
say
what
is
not
many
words
will
not
suffice
if
you
wish
to
say
what
is
a
few
words
will
be
spadevil
frowned
to
hate
pleasure
brings
pride
with
it
pride
is
a
pleasure
to
kill
pleasure
we
must
attach
ourselves
to
duty
while
the
mind
is
planning
right
action
it
has
no
time
to
think
of
is
that
the
whole
asked
catice
the
truth
is
simple
even
for
the
simplest
do
you
destroy
hator
and
all
his
generations
with
a
single
word
i
destroy
nature
and
set
up
a
long
silence
followed
my
probe
is
double
said
spadevil
suffer
me
to
double
yours
and
you
will
see
as
i
come
you
here
you
big
man
said
catice
to
maskull
maskull
advanced
a
step
closer
do
you
follow
spadevil
in
his
new
faith
as
far
as
death
exclaimed
maskull
catice
picked
up
a
flint
with
this
stone
i
strike
out
one
of
your
two
probes
when
you
have
but
one
you
will
see
with
me
and
you
will
recollect
with
spadevil
choose
you
then
the
superior
faith
and
i
shall
obey
your
endure
this
little
pain
maskull
for
the
sake
of
future
men
said
spadevil
the
pain
is
nothing
replied
maskull
but
i
fear
the
permit
me
although
i
am
only
a
woman
to
take
his
place
catice
said
tydomin
stretching
out
her
hand
he
struck
at
it
violently
with
the
flint
and
gashed
it
from
wrist
to
thumb
the
pale
carmine
blood
spouted
up
what
brings
this
to
sant
he
said
how
does
she
presume
to
make
the
rules
of
life
for
the
sons
of
hator
she
bit
her
lip
and
stepped
back
well
then
maskull
accept
i
certainly
should
not
have
played
false
to
spadevil
but
you
hardly
if
he
bids
me
i
must
do
it
said
maskull
but
who
knows
what
will
come
of
it
spadevil
spoke
of
all
the
descendants
of
hator
catice
is
the
most
wholehearted
and
sincere
he
will
trample
my
truth
underfoot
thinking
me
a
demon
sent
by
shaping
to
destroy
the
work
of
this
land
but
a
seed
will
escape
and
my
blood
and
yours
tydomin
will
wash
it
then
men
will
know
that
my
destroying
evil
is
their
greatest
good
but
none
here
will
live
to
see
maskull
now
went
quite
close
to
catice
and
offered
his
head
catice
raised
his
hand
and
after
holding
the
flint
poised
for
a
moment
brought
it
down
with
adroitness
and
force
upon
the
probe
maskull
cried
out
with
the
pain
the
blood
streamed
down
and
the
function
of
the
organ
was
destroyed
there
was
a
pause
while
he
walked
to
and
fro
trying
to
staunch
the
blood
what
now
do
you
feel
maskull
what
do
you
see
inquired
tydomin
anxiously
he
stopped
and
stared
hard
at
her
i
now
see
straight
he
said
slowly
what
does
that
mean
he
continued
to
wipe
the
blood
from
his
forehead
he
looked
troubled
henceforward
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
fight
with
my
nature
and
refuse
to
feel
pleasure
and
i
advise
you
to
do
the
spadevil
gazed
at
him
sternly
do
you
renounce
my
teaching
maskull
however
returned
the
gaze
without
dismay
spadevil
s
like
clearness
of
form
had
departed
for
him
his
frowning
face
he
knew
to
be
the
deceptive
portico
of
a
weak
and
confused
intellect
it
is
is
it
false
to
sacrifice
oneself
for
another
demanded
tydomin
i
can
t
argue
as
yet
said
maskull
at
this
moment
the
world
with
its
sweetness
seems
to
me
a
sort
of
charnel
house
i
feel
a
loathing
for
everything
in
it
including
myself
i
know
no
is
there
no
duty
asked
spadevil
in
a
harsh
tone
it
appears
to
me
but
a
cloak
under
which
we
share
the
pleasure
of
other
tydomin
pulled
at
spadevil
s
arm
maskull
has
betrayed
you
as
he
has
so
many
others
let
us
he
stood
fast
you
have
changed
quickly
maskull
without
answering
him
turned
to
catice
why
do
men
go
on
living
in
this
soft
shameful
world
when
they
can
kill
themselves
pain
is
the
native
air
of
surtur
s
children
to
what
other
air
do
you
wish
to
escape
surtur
s
children
is
not
surtur
shaping
it
is
the
greatest
of
lies
it
is
shaping
s
answer
maskull
said
spadevil
do
you
repudiate
right
action
leave
me
alone
go
back
i
am
not
thinking
of
you
and
your
ideas
i
wish
you
no
the
darkness
came
on
fast
there
was
another
prolonged
silence
catice
threw
away
the
flint
and
picked
up
his
staff
the
woman
must
return
home
he
said
she
was
persuaded
here
and
did
not
come
freely
you
spadevil
must
as
you
are
tydomin
said
quietly
he
has
no
power
to
enforce
this
are
you
going
to
allow
the
truth
to
fall
to
the
ground
spadevil
it
will
not
perish
by
my
death
but
by
my
efforts
to
escape
from
death
catice
i
accept
your
tydomin
smiled
for
my
part
i
am
too
tired
to
walk
farther
today
so
i
shall
die
with
catice
said
to
maskull
prove
your
sincerity
kill
this
man
and
his
mistress
according
to
the
laws
of
i
can
t
do
that
i
have
travelled
in
friendship
with
you
denied
duty
and
now
you
must
do
your
duty
said
spadevil
calmly
stroking
his
beard
whatever
law
you
accept
you
must
obey
without
turning
to
right
or
left
your
law
commands
that
we
must
be
stoned
and
it
will
soon
be
have
you
not
even
this
amount
of
manhood
exclaimed
tydomin
maskull
moved
heavily
be
my
witness
catice
that
the
thing
was
forced
on
hator
is
looking
on
and
approving
replied
catice
maskull
then
went
apart
to
the
pile
of
boulders
scattered
by
the
side
of
the
pool
he
glanced
about
him
and
selected
two
large
fragments
of
rock
the
heaviest
that
he
thought
he
could
carry
with
these
in
his
arms
he
staggered
back
he
dropped
them
on
the
ground
and
stood
recovering
his
breath
when
he
could
speak
again
he
said
i
have
a
bad
heart
for
the
business
is
there
no
alternative
sleep
here
tonight
spadevil
and
in
the
morning
go
back
to
where
you
have
come
from
no
one
shall
harm
spadevil
s
ironic
smile
was
lost
in
the
gloom
shall
i
brood
again
maskull
for
still
another
year
and
after
that
come
back
to
sant
with
other
truths
come
waste
no
time
but
choose
the
heavier
stone
for
me
for
i
am
stronger
than
maskull
lifted
one
of
the
rocks
and
stepped
out
four
full
paces
spadevil
confronted
him
erect
and
waited
tranquilly
the
huge
stone
hurtled
through
the
air
its
flight
looked
like
a
dark
shadow
it
struck
spadevil
full
in
the
face
crushing
his
features
and
breaking
his
neck
he
died
instantaneously
tydomin
looked
away
from
the
fallen
man
be
very
quick
maskull
and
don
t
let
me
keep
him
he
panted
and
raised
the
second
stone
she
placed
herself
in
front
of
spadevil
s
body
and
stood
there
unsmiling
and
cold
the
blow
caught
her
between
breast
and
chin
and
she
fell
maskull
went
to
her
and
kneeling
on
the
ground
her
in
his
arms
there
she
breathed
out
her
last
sighs
after
that
he
laid
her
down
again
and
rested
heavily
on
his
hands
while
he
peered
into
the
dead
face
the
transition
from
its
heroic
spiritual
expression
to
the
vulgar
and
grinning
mask
of
crystalman
came
like
a
flash
but
he
saw
it
he
stood
up
in
the
darkness
and
pulled
catice
toward
him
is
that
the
true
likeness
of
shaping
it
is
shaping
stripped
of
how
comes
this
horrible
world
to
exist
catice
did
not
answer
who
is
surtur
you
will
get
nearer
to
him
tomorrow
but
not
i
am
wading
through
too
much
blood
said
maskull
nothing
good
can
come
of
do
not
fear
change
and
destruction
but
laughter
and
maskull
meditated
tell
me
catice
if
i
had
elected
to
follow
spadevil
would
you
really
have
accepted
his
faith
he
was
a
man
replied
catice
i
see
that
the
pride
of
our
men
is
only
another
of
pleasure
tomorrow
i
too
shall
leave
sant
to
reflect
on
all
maskull
shuddered
then
these
two
deaths
were
not
a
necessity
but
a
crime
his
part
was
played
and
henceforward
the
woman
would
have
dragged
down
his
ideas
with
her
soft
love
and
loyalty
regret
nothing
stranger
but
go
away
at
once
out
of
the
tonight
where
shall
i
go
to
wombflash
where
you
will
meet
the
deepest
minds
i
will
put
you
on
the
he
linked
his
arm
in
maskull
s
and
they
walked
away
into
the
night
for
a
mile
or
more
they
skirted
the
edge
of
the
precipice
the
wind
was
searching
and
drove
grit
into
their
faces
through
the
rifts
of
the
clouds
stars
faint
and
brilliant
appeared
maskull
saw
no
familiar
constellations
he
wondered
if
the
sun
of
earth
was
visible
and
if
so
which
one
it
was
they
came
to
the
head
of
a
rough
staircase
leading
down
the
cliffside
it
resembled
the
one
by
which
he
had
come
up
but
this
descended
to
the
wombflash
forest
that
is
your
path
said
catice
and
i
shall
not
come
any
maskull
detained
him
say
just
this
before
we
part
does
pleasure
appear
so
shameful
to
us
because
in
feeling
pleasure
we
forget
our
and
that
muspel
answered
catice
having
made
this
reply
he
disengaged
himself
and
turning
his
back
disappeared
into
the
darkness
maskull
stumbled
down
the
staircase
as
best
he
could
he
was
tired
but
contemptuous
of
his
pains
his
uninjured
probe
began
to
discharge
matter
he
lowered
himself
from
step
to
step
during
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
the
rustling
and
sighing
of
the
trees
grew
louder
as
he
approached
the
bottom
the
air
became
still
and
warm
inky
blackness
was
all
around
him
he
at
last
reached
level
ground
still
attempting
to
proceed
he
began
to
trip
over
roots
and
to
collide
with
tree
trunks
after
this
had
happened
a
few
times
he
determined
to
go
no
farther
that
night
he
heaped
together
some
dry
leaves
for
a
pillow
and
immediately
flung
himself
down
to
sleep
deep
and
heavy
unconsciousness
seized
him
almost
instantly
chapter
the
wombflash
forest
he
awoke
to
his
third
day
on
tormance
his
limbs
ached
he
lay
on
his
side
looking
stupidly
at
his
surroundings
the
forest
was
like
night
but
that
period
of
the
night
when
the
grey
dawn
is
about
to
break
and
objects
begin
to
be
guessed
at
rather
than
seen
two
or
three
amazing
shadowy
shapes
as
broad
as
houses
loomed
up
out
of
the
twilight
he
did
not
realise
that
they
were
trees
until
he
turned
over
on
his
back
and
followed
their
course
upward
far
overhead
so
high
up
that
he
dared
not
calculate
the
height
he
saw
their
tops
glittering
in
the
sunlight
against
a
tiny
patch
of
blue
sky
clouds
of
mist
rolling
over
the
floor
of
the
forest
kept
interrupting
his
view
in
their
silent
passage
they
were
like
phantoms
flitting
among
the
trees
the
leaves
underneath
him
were
sodden
and
heavy
drops
of
moisture
splashed
onto
his
head
from
time
to
time
he
continued
lying
there
trying
to
reconstruct
the
events
of
the
preceding
day
his
brain
was
lethargic
and
confused
something
terrible
had
happened
but
what
it
was
he
could
not
for
a
long
time
recollect
then
suddenly
there
came
before
his
eyes
that
ghastly
closing
scene
at
dusk
on
the
sant
s
crushed
and
bloody
features
and
tydomin
s
dying
sighs
he
shuddered
convulsively
and
felt
sick
the
peculiar
moral
outlook
that
had
dictated
these
brutal
murders
had
departed
from
him
during
the
night
and
now
he
recognised
what
he
had
done
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
day
he
seemed
to
have
been
labouring
under
a
series
of
heavy
enchantments
first
oceaxe
had
enslaved
him
then
tydomin
then
spadevil
and
lastly
catice
they
had
forced
him
to
murder
and
violate
he
had
guessed
nothing
but
had
imagined
that
he
was
travelling
as
a
free
and
enlightened
stranger
what
was
this
nightmare
journey
would
it
continue
in
the
same
way
the
silence
of
the
forest
was
so
intense
that
he
heard
no
sound
except
the
pumping
of
blood
through
his
arteries
putting
his
hand
to
his
face
he
found
that
his
remaining
probe
had
disappeared
and
that
he
was
in
possession
of
three
eyes
the
third
eye
was
on
his
forehead
where
the
old
sorb
had
been
he
could
not
guess
its
use
he
still
had
his
third
arm
but
it
was
nerveless
now
he
puzzled
his
head
for
a
long
time
trying
unsuccessfully
to
recall
that
name
which
had
been
the
last
word
spoken
by
catice
he
got
up
with
the
intention
of
resuming
his
journey
he
had
no
toilet
to
make
and
no
meal
to
prepare
the
forest
was
tremendous
the
nearest
tree
appeared
to
him
to
have
a
circumference
of
at
least
a
hundred
feet
other
dim
boles
looked
equally
large
but
what
gave
the
scene
its
aspect
of
immensity
was
the
vast
spaces
separating
tree
from
tree
it
was
like
some
gigantic
supernatural
hall
in
a
life
after
death
the
lowest
branches
were
fifty
yards
or
more
from
the
ground
there
was
no
underbrush
the
soil
was
carpeted
only
by
the
dead
wet
leaves
he
looked
all
around
him
to
find
his
direction
but
the
cliffs
of
sant
which
he
had
descended
were
way
was
like
every
other
way
he
had
no
idea
which
quarter
to
attack
he
grew
frightened
and
muttered
to
himself
craning
his
neck
back
he
stared
upward
and
tried
to
discover
the
points
of
the
compass
from
the
direction
of
the
sunlight
but
it
was
impossible
while
he
was
standing
there
anxious
and
hesitating
he
heard
the
drum
taps
the
rhythmical
beats
proceeded
from
some
distance
off
the
unseen
drummer
seemed
to
be
marching
through
the
forest
away
from
him
surtur
he
said
under
his
breath
the
next
moment
he
marvelled
at
himself
for
uttering
the
name
that
mysterious
being
had
not
been
in
his
thoughts
nor
was
there
any
ostensible
connection
between
him
and
the
drumming
he
began
to
in
the
meantime
the
sounds
were
travelling
away
automatically
he
started
walking
in
the
same
direction
the
drum
beats
had
this
odd
and
mystical
there
was
nothing
inspiring
in
them
but
on
the
contrary
they
reminded
him
of
some
place
and
some
life
with
which
he
was
perfectly
familiar
once
again
they
caused
all
his
other
sense
impressions
to
appear
false
the
sounds
were
intermittent
they
would
go
on
for
a
minute
or
for
five
minutes
and
then
cease
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
maskull
followed
them
as
well
as
he
could
he
walked
hard
among
the
huge
indistinct
trees
in
the
attempt
to
come
up
with
the
origin
of
the
noise
but
the
same
distance
always
seemed
to
separate
them
the
forest
from
now
onward
descended
the
gradient
was
mostly
one
foot
in
in
some
places
it
was
much
steeper
and
in
other
parts
again
it
was
practically
level
ground
for
quite
long
stretches
there
were
great
swampy
marshes
through
which
maskull
was
obliged
to
splash
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
how
wet
he
only
he
could
catch
sight
of
that
individual
with
the
drum
mile
after
mile
was
covered
and
still
he
was
no
nearer
to
doing
so
the
gloom
of
the
forest
settled
down
upon
his
spirits
he
felt
despondent
tired
and
savage
he
had
not
heard
the
drum
beats
for
some
while
and
was
half
inclined
to
discontinue
the
pursuit
passing
around
a
great
columnar
tree
trunk
he
almost
stumbled
against
a
man
who
was
standing
on
the
farther
side
he
was
leaning
against
the
trunk
with
one
hand
in
an
attitude
of
repose
his
other
hand
was
resting
on
a
staff
maskull
stopped
short
and
stared
at
him
he
was
nearly
naked
and
of
gigantic
build
he
maskull
by
a
head
his
face
and
body
were
faintly
phosphorescent
his
in
pale
green
and
luminous
shining
like
lamps
his
skin
was
hairless
but
the
hair
of
his
head
was
piled
up
in
thick
black
coils
and
fastened
like
a
woman
s
his
features
were
absolutely
tranquil
but
a
terrible
quiet
energy
seemed
to
lie
just
underneath
the
surface
maskull
addressed
him
did
the
drumming
come
from
you
the
man
shook
his
head
what
is
your
name
he
replied
in
a
strange
strained
twisted
voice
maskull
gathered
that
the
name
he
gave
was
what
is
that
drumming
surtur
said
dreamsinter
is
it
advisable
for
me
to
follow
it
why
perhaps
he
intends
me
to
he
brought
me
here
from
dreamsinter
caught
hold
of
him
bent
down
and
peered
into
his
face
not
you
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
maskull
had
heard
nightspore
s
name
since
his
arrival
on
the
planet
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
could
frame
no
more
questions
eat
this
said
dreamsinter
then
we
will
chase
the
sound
he
picked
something
up
from
the
ground
and
handed
it
to
maskull
he
could
not
see
distinctly
but
it
felt
like
a
hard
round
nut
of
the
size
of
a
fist
i
can
t
crack
dreamsinter
took
it
between
his
hands
and
broke
it
into
pieces
maskull
then
ate
some
of
the
pulpy
interior
which
was
intensely
disagreeable
what
am
i
doing
in
tormance
then
he
asked
you
came
to
steal
to
give
a
deeper
life
to
doubting
if
your
soul
could
endure
that
maskull
could
hardly
decipher
the
strangled
words
muspel
that
s
the
name
i
ve
been
trying
to
remember
ever
since
i
dreamsinter
suddenly
turned
his
head
sideways
and
appeared
to
listen
for
something
he
motioned
with
his
hand
to
maskull
to
keep
quiet
is
it
the
drumming
hush
they
he
was
looking
toward
the
upper
forest
the
now
familiar
drum
rhythm
was
time
accompanied
by
the
tramp
of
marching
feet
maskull
saw
marching
through
the
trees
and
heading
toward
them
three
men
in
single
file
separated
from
one
another
by
only
a
yard
or
so
they
were
travelling
down
hill
at
a
swift
pace
and
looked
neither
to
left
nor
right
they
were
naked
their
figures
were
shining
against
the
black
background
of
the
forest
with
a
pale
supernatural
and
ghostly
when
they
were
abreast
of
him
about
twenty
feet
off
he
perceived
who
they
were
the
first
man
was
the
second
was
krag
the
third
man
was
nightspore
their
faces
were
grim
and
set
the
source
of
the
drumming
was
out
of
sight
the
sound
appeared
to
come
from
some
point
in
front
of
them
maskull
and
dreamsinter
put
themselves
in
motion
to
keep
up
with
the
swiftly
moving
marchers
at
the
same
time
a
low
faint
music
began
its
rhythm
stepped
with
the
drum
beats
but
unlike
the
latter
it
did
not
seem
to
proceed
from
any
particular
quarter
of
the
forest
it
resembled
the
subjective
music
heard
in
dreams
which
accompanies
the
dreamer
everywhere
as
a
sort
of
natural
atmosphere
rendering
all
his
experiences
emotional
it
seemed
to
issue
from
an
unearthly
orchestra
and
was
strongly
troubled
pathetic
and
tragic
maskull
marched
and
listened
and
as
he
listened
it
grew
louder
and
stormier
but
the
pulse
of
the
drum
interpenetrated
all
the
other
sounds
like
the
quiet
beating
of
reality
his
emotion
deepened
he
could
not
have
said
if
minutes
or
hours
were
passing
the
spectral
procession
marched
on
a
little
way
ahead
on
a
path
parallel
with
his
own
and
dreamsinter
s
the
music
pulsated
violently
krag
lifted
his
arm
and
displayed
a
long
knife
he
sprang
forward
and
raising
it
over
the
phantom
maskull
s
back
stabbed
him
twice
leaving
the
knife
in
the
wound
the
second
time
maskull
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
down
dead
krag
leaped
into
the
forest
and
vanished
from
sight
nightspore
marched
on
alone
stern
and
unmoved
the
music
rose
to
crescendo
the
whole
dim
gigantic
forest
was
roaring
with
sound
the
tones
came
from
all
sides
from
above
from
the
ground
under
their
feet
it
was
so
grandly
passionate
that
maskull
felt
his
soul
loosening
from
its
bodily
envelope
he
continued
to
follow
nightspore
a
strange
brightness
began
to
glow
in
front
of
them
it
was
not
daylight
but
a
radiance
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
and
such
as
he
could
not
have
imagined
to
be
possible
nightspore
moved
straight
toward
it
maskull
felt
his
chest
bursting
the
light
flashed
higher
the
awful
harmonies
of
the
music
followed
hard
one
upon
another
like
the
waves
of
a
wild
magic
ocean
his
body
was
incapable
of
enduring
such
shocks
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
tumbled
over
in
a
faint
that
resembled
death
chapter
polecrab
the
morning
slowly
passed
maskull
made
some
convulsive
movements
and
opened
his
eyes
he
sat
up
blinking
all
was
and
silent
in
the
forest
the
strange
light
had
gone
the
music
had
ceased
dreamsinter
had
vanished
he
fingered
his
beard
clotted
with
tydomin
s
blood
and
fell
into
a
deep
muse
according
to
panawe
and
catice
this
forest
contains
wise
men
perhaps
dreamsinter
was
one
perhaps
that
vision
i
have
just
seen
was
a
specimen
of
his
wisdom
it
looked
almost
like
an
answer
to
my
question
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
about
myself
but
about
surtur
then
i
would
have
got
a
different
answer
i
might
have
learned
something
i
might
have
seen
he
remained
quiet
and
apathetic
for
a
bit
but
i
couldn
t
face
that
awful
glare
he
proceeded
it
was
bursting
my
body
he
warned
me
too
and
so
surtur
does
really
exist
and
my
journey
stands
for
something
but
why
am
i
here
and
what
can
i
do
who
is
surtur
where
is
he
to
be
found
something
wild
came
into
his
eyes
what
did
dreamsinter
mean
by
his
not
you
but
nightspore
am
i
a
secondary
he
regarded
as
important
and
i
as
unimportant
where
is
nightspore
and
what
is
he
doing
am
i
to
wait
for
his
time
and
i
originate
nothing
he
continued
sitting
up
with
legs
i
must
make
up
my
mind
that
this
is
a
strange
journey
and
that
the
strangest
things
will
happen
in
it
it
s
no
use
making
plans
for
i
can
t
see
two
steps
is
unknown
but
one
thing
s
evident
nothing
but
the
wildest
audacity
will
carry
me
through
and
i
must
sacrifice
everything
else
to
that
and
therefore
if
surtur
shows
himself
again
i
shall
go
forward
to
meet
him
even
if
it
means
through
the
black
quiet
aisles
of
the
forest
the
drum
beats
came
again
the
sound
was
a
long
way
off
and
very
faint
it
was
like
the
last
mutterings
of
thunder
after
a
heavy
storm
maskull
listened
without
getting
up
the
drumming
faded
into
silence
and
did
not
return
he
smiled
queerly
and
said
aloud
thanks
surtur
i
accept
the
when
he
was
about
to
get
up
he
found
that
the
shrivelled
skin
that
had
been
his
third
arm
was
flapping
disconcertingly
with
every
movement
of
his
body
he
made
perforations
in
it
all
around
as
close
to
his
chest
as
possible
with
the
fingernails
of
both
hands
then
he
carefully
twisted
it
off
in
that
world
of
rapid
growth
and
ungrowth
he
judged
that
the
stump
would
soon
disappear
after
that
he
rose
and
peered
into
the
darkness
the
forest
at
that
point
sloped
rather
steeply
and
without
thinking
twice
about
it
he
took
the
downhill
direction
never
doubting
it
would
bring
him
somewhere
as
soon
as
he
started
walking
his
temper
became
gloomy
and
was
shaken
tired
dirty
and
languid
with
hunger
moreover
he
realised
that
the
walk
was
not
going
to
be
a
short
one
be
that
as
it
may
he
determined
to
sit
down
no
more
until
the
whole
dismal
forest
was
at
his
back
one
after
another
the
shadowy
houselike
trees
were
observed
avoided
and
passed
far
overhead
the
little
patch
of
glowing
sky
was
still
always
visible
otherwise
he
had
no
clue
to
the
time
of
day
he
continued
tramping
sullenly
down
the
slope
for
many
damp
slippery
some
places
through
bogs
when
presently
the
twilight
seemed
to
thin
he
guessed
that
the
open
world
was
not
far
away
the
forest
grew
more
palpable
and
grey
and
now
he
saw
its
majesty
better
the
tree
trunks
were
like
round
towers
and
so
wide
were
the
intervals
that
they
resembled
natural
amphitheatres
he
could
not
make
out
the
colour
of
the
bark
everything
he
saw
amazed
him
but
his
admiration
was
of
the
growling
grudging
kind
the
difference
in
light
between
the
forest
behind
him
and
the
forest
ahead
became
so
marked
that
he
could
no
longer
doubt
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
coming
out
real
light
was
in
front
of
him
looking
back
he
found
he
had
a
shadow
the
trunks
acquired
a
reddish
tint
he
quickened
his
pace
as
the
minutes
went
by
the
bright
patch
ahead
grew
luminous
and
vivid
it
had
a
tinge
of
blue
he
also
imagined
that
he
heard
the
sound
of
surf
all
that
part
of
the
forest
toward
which
he
was
moving
became
rich
with
colour
the
boles
of
the
trees
were
of
a
deep
dark
red
their
leaves
high
above
his
head
were
the
dead
leaves
on
the
ground
were
of
a
colour
he
could
not
name
at
the
same
time
he
discovered
the
use
of
his
third
eye
by
adding
a
third
angle
to
his
sight
every
object
he
looked
at
stood
out
in
greater
relief
the
world
looked
less
realistic
and
significant
he
had
a
stronger
attraction
toward
his
surroundings
he
seemed
somehow
to
lose
his
egotism
and
to
become
free
and
thoughtful
now
through
the
last
trees
he
saw
full
daylight
less
than
half
a
mile
separated
him
from
the
border
of
the
forest
and
eager
to
discover
what
lay
beyond
he
broke
into
a
run
he
heard
the
surf
louder
it
was
a
peculiar
hissing
sound
that
could
proceed
only
from
water
yet
was
unlike
the
sea
almost
immediately
he
came
within
sight
of
an
enormous
horizon
of
dancing
waves
which
he
knew
must
be
the
sinking
sea
he
fell
back
into
a
quick
walk
continuing
to
stare
hard
the
wind
that
met
him
was
hot
fresh
and
sweet
when
he
arrived
at
the
final
fringe
of
forest
which
joined
the
wide
sands
of
the
shore
without
any
change
of
level
he
leaned
with
his
back
to
a
great
tree
and
gazed
his
fill
motionless
at
what
lay
in
front
of
him
the
sands
continued
east
and
west
in
a
straight
line
broken
only
here
and
there
by
a
few
creeks
they
were
of
a
brilliant
orange
colour
but
there
were
patches
of
violet
the
forest
appeared
to
stand
sentinel
over
the
shore
for
its
entire
length
everything
else
was
sea
and
had
never
seen
so
much
water
the
semicircle
of
the
skyline
was
so
vast
that
he
might
have
imagined
himself
on
a
flat
world
with
a
range
of
vision
determined
only
by
the
power
of
his
eye
the
sea
was
unlike
any
sea
on
earth
it
resembled
an
immense
liquid
opal
on
a
body
colour
of
rich
magnificent
flashes
of
red
yellow
and
blue
were
everywhere
shooting
up
and
vanishing
the
wave
motion
was
extraordinary
pinnacles
of
water
were
slowly
formed
until
they
attained
a
height
of
perhaps
ten
or
twenty
feet
when
they
would
suddenly
sink
downward
and
outward
creating
in
their
descent
a
series
of
concentric
rings
for
long
distances
around
them
quickly
moving
currents
like
rivers
in
the
sea
could
be
seen
racing
away
from
land
they
were
of
a
darker
green
and
bore
no
pinnacles
where
the
sea
met
the
shore
the
waves
rushed
over
the
sands
far
in
with
almost
sinister
by
a
weird
hissing
spitting
sound
which
was
what
maskull
had
heard
the
green
tongues
rolled
in
without
foam
about
twenty
miles
distant
as
he
judged
directly
opposite
him
a
long
low
island
stood
up
from
the
sea
black
and
not
distinguished
in
outline
it
was
swaylone
s
island
maskull
was
less
interested
in
that
than
in
the
blue
sunset
that
glowed
behind
its
back
alppain
had
set
but
the
whole
northern
sky
was
plunged
into
the
minor
key
by
its
afterlight
branchspell
in
the
zenith
was
white
and
overpowering
the
day
was
cloudless
and
terrifically
hot
but
where
the
blue
sun
had
sunk
a
sombre
shadow
seemed
to
overhang
the
world
maskull
had
a
feeling
of
as
if
two
chemically
distinct
forces
were
simultaneously
acting
upon
the
cells
of
his
body
since
the
afterglow
of
alppain
affected
him
like
this
he
thought
it
more
than
likely
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
face
that
sun
itself
and
go
on
living
still
some
modification
might
happen
to
him
that
would
make
it
possible
the
sea
tempted
him
he
made
up
his
mind
to
bathe
and
at
once
walked
toward
the
shore
the
instant
he
stepped
outside
the
shadow
line
of
the
forest
trees
the
blinding
rays
of
the
sun
beat
down
on
him
so
savagely
that
for
a
few
minutes
he
felt
sick
and
his
head
swam
he
trod
quickly
across
the
sands
the
parts
were
nearly
hot
enough
to
roast
food
he
judged
but
the
violet
parts
were
like
fire
itself
he
stepped
on
a
patch
in
ignorance
and
immediately
jumped
high
into
the
air
with
a
startled
yell
the
sea
was
voluptuously
warm
it
would
not
bear
his
weight
so
he
determined
to
try
swimming
first
of
all
he
stripped
off
his
skin
garment
washed
it
thoroughly
with
sand
and
water
and
laid
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
then
he
scrubbed
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
washed
out
his
beard
and
hair
after
that
he
waded
in
a
long
way
until
the
water
reached
his
breast
and
took
to
the
spouts
as
far
as
possible
he
found
it
no
pastime
the
water
was
everywhere
of
unequal
density
in
some
places
he
could
swim
in
others
he
could
barely
save
himself
from
drowning
in
others
again
he
could
not
force
himself
beneath
the
surface
at
all
there
were
no
outward
signs
to
show
what
the
water
ahead
held
in
store
for
him
the
whole
business
was
most
dangerous
he
came
out
feeling
clean
and
invigorated
for
a
time
he
walked
up
and
down
the
sands
drying
himself
in
the
hot
sunshine
and
looking
around
him
he
was
a
naked
stranger
in
a
huge
foreign
mystical
world
and
whichever
way
he
turned
unknown
and
threatening
forces
were
glaring
at
him
the
gigantic
white
withering
branchspell
the
awful
changing
alppain
the
beautiful
deadly
treacherous
sea
the
dark
and
eerie
swaylone
s
island
the
forest
out
of
which
he
had
just
all
these
mighty
powers
surrounding
him
on
every
side
what
resources
had
he
a
feeble
ignorant
traveller
from
a
tiny
planet
on
the
other
side
of
space
to
oppose
to
avoid
being
utterly
destroyed
then
he
smiled
to
himself
i
ve
already
been
here
two
days
and
still
i
survive
i
have
with
that
one
can
balance
the
universe
but
what
is
verbal
expression
or
a
thing
as
he
was
putting
on
his
skin
which
was
now
dry
the
answer
came
to
him
and
this
time
he
was
grave
surtur
brought
me
here
and
surtur
is
watching
over
me
that
is
my
but
what
is
surtur
in
this
world
how
is
he
able
to
protect
me
against
the
blind
and
ungovernable
forces
of
nature
is
he
stronger
than
nature
hungry
as
he
was
for
food
he
was
hungrier
still
for
human
society
for
he
wished
to
inquire
about
all
these
things
he
asked
himself
which
way
he
should
turn
his
steps
there
were
only
two
ways
along
the
shore
either
east
or
west
the
nearest
creek
lay
to
the
east
cutting
the
sands
about
a
mile
away
he
walked
toward
it
the
forest
face
was
forbidding
and
enormously
high
it
was
so
squarely
turned
to
the
sea
that
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
planed
by
tools
maskull
strode
along
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
but
kept
his
head
constantly
turned
away
from
them
toward
the
it
was
more
cheerful
the
creek
when
he
reached
it
proved
to
be
broad
and
banked
it
was
not
a
river
but
an
arm
of
the
sea
its
still
dark
green
water
curved
around
a
bend
out
of
sight
into
the
forest
the
trees
on
both
banks
overhung
the
water
so
that
it
was
completely
in
shadow
he
went
as
far
as
the
bend
beyond
which
another
short
reach
appeared
a
man
was
sitting
on
a
narrow
shelf
of
bank
with
his
feet
in
the
water
he
was
clothed
in
a
coarse
rough
hide
which
left
his
limbs
bare
he
was
short
thick
and
sturdy
with
short
legs
and
a
long
powerful
arms
terminating
in
hands
of
an
extraordinary
size
he
was
oldish
his
face
was
plain
slablike
and
expressionless
it
was
full
of
wrinkles
and
both
face
and
head
were
bald
and
his
skin
was
tough
and
leathery
he
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
peasant
or
fisherman
there
was
no
trace
in
his
face
of
thought
for
others
or
delicacy
of
feeling
he
possessed
three
eyes
of
different
blue
and
ulfire
in
front
of
him
riding
on
the
water
moored
to
the
bank
was
an
elementary
raft
consisting
of
the
branches
of
trees
clumsily
corded
together
maskull
addressed
him
are
you
another
of
the
wise
men
of
the
wombflash
forest
the
man
answered
him
in
a
gruff
husky
voice
looking
up
as
he
did
so
i
m
a
fisherman
i
know
nothing
about
what
name
do
you
go
by
polecrab
what
s
yours
maskull
if
you
re
a
fisherman
you
ought
to
have
fish
i
m
polecrab
grunted
and
paused
a
minute
before
answering
there
s
fish
enough
my
dinner
is
cooking
in
the
sands
now
it
s
easy
enough
to
get
you
some
maskull
found
this
a
pleasant
speech
but
how
long
will
it
take
he
asked
the
man
slid
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
producing
a
shrill
screeching
noise
he
lifted
his
feet
from
the
water
and
clambered
onto
the
bank
in
a
minute
or
two
a
curious
little
beast
came
crawling
up
to
his
feet
turning
its
face
and
eyes
up
affectionately
like
a
dog
it
was
about
two
feet
long
and
somewhat
resembled
a
small
seal
but
had
six
legs
ending
in
strong
claws
arg
go
fish
said
polecrab
hoarsely
the
animal
immediately
tumbled
off
the
bank
into
the
water
it
swam
gracefully
to
the
middle
of
the
creek
and
made
a
pivotal
dive
beneath
the
surface
where
it
remained
a
great
while
simple
fishing
remarked
maskull
but
what
s
the
raft
for
to
go
to
sea
with
the
best
fish
are
out
at
sea
these
are
that
arg
seems
a
highly
intelligent
polecrab
grunted
again
i
ve
trained
close
on
a
hundred
of
them
the
bigheads
learn
best
but
they
re
slow
swimmers
the
narrowheads
swim
like
eels
but
can
t
be
taught
now
i
ve
started
interbreeding
s
one
of
do
you
live
here
alone
no
i
ve
got
a
wife
and
three
boys
my
wife
s
sleeping
somewhere
but
where
the
lads
are
shaping
maskull
began
to
feel
very
much
at
home
with
this
unsophisticated
being
the
raft
s
all
crazy
he
remarked
staring
at
it
if
you
go
far
out
in
that
you
ve
got
more
pluck
than
i
i
ve
been
to
matterplay
on
it
said
polecrab
the
arg
reappeared
and
started
swimming
to
shore
but
this
time
clumsily
as
if
it
were
bearing
a
heavy
weight
under
the
surface
when
it
landed
at
its
master
s
feet
they
saw
that
each
set
of
claws
was
clutching
a
in
all
polecrab
took
them
from
it
he
proceeded
to
cut
off
the
heads
and
tails
with
a
stone
which
he
picked
up
these
he
threw
to
the
arg
which
devoured
them
without
any
fuss
polecrab
beckoned
to
maskull
to
follow
him
and
carrying
the
fish
walked
toward
the
open
shore
by
the
same
way
that
he
had
come
when
they
reached
the
sands
he
sliced
the
fish
removed
the
entrails
and
digging
a
shallow
hole
in
a
patch
of
violet
sand
placed
the
remainder
of
the
carcasses
in
it
and
covered
them
over
again
then
he
dug
up
his
own
dinner
maskull
s
nostrils
quivered
at
the
savoury
smell
but
he
was
not
yet
to
dine
polecrab
turning
to
go
with
the
cooked
fish
in
his
hands
said
these
are
mine
not
yours
when
yours
are
done
you
can
come
back
and
join
me
supposing
you
want
how
soon
will
that
be
about
twenty
minutes
replied
the
fisherman
over
his
shoulder
maskull
sheltered
himself
in
the
shadows
of
the
forest
and
waited
when
the
time
had
approximately
elapsed
he
disinterred
his
meal
scorching
his
fingers
in
the
operation
although
it
was
only
the
surface
of
the
sand
which
was
so
intensely
hot
then
he
returned
to
polecrab
in
the
warm
still
air
and
cheerful
shade
of
the
inlet
they
munched
in
silence
looking
from
their
food
to
the
sluggish
water
and
back
again
with
every
mouthful
maskull
felt
his
strength
returning
he
finished
before
polecrab
who
ate
like
a
man
for
whom
time
has
no
value
when
he
had
done
he
stood
up
come
and
drink
he
said
in
his
husky
voice
maskull
looked
at
him
inquiringly
the
man
led
him
a
little
way
into
the
forest
and
walked
straight
up
to
a
certain
tree
at
a
convenient
height
in
its
trunk
a
hole
had
been
tapped
and
plugged
polecrab
removed
the
plug
and
put
his
mouth
to
the
aperture
sucking
for
quite
a
long
time
like
a
child
at
its
mother
s
breast
maskull
watching
him
imagined
that
he
saw
his
eyes
growing
brighter
when
his
own
turn
came
to
drink
he
found
the
juice
of
the
tree
somewhat
like
coconut
milk
in
flavour
but
intoxicating
it
was
a
new
sort
of
intoxication
however
for
neither
his
will
not
his
emotions
were
excited
but
only
his
that
only
in
a
certain
way
his
thoughts
and
images
were
not
freed
and
loosened
but
on
the
contrary
kept
labouring
and
swelling
painfully
until
they
reached
the
full
beauty
of
an
aperçu
which
would
then
flame
up
in
his
consciousness
burst
and
vanish
after
that
the
whole
process
started
over
again
but
there
was
never
a
moment
when
he
was
not
perfectly
cool
and
master
of
his
senses
when
each
had
drunk
twice
polecrab
replugged
the
hole
and
they
returned
to
their
bank
is
it
blodsombre
yet
asked
maskull
sprawling
on
the
ground
well
content
polecrab
resumed
his
old
upright
sitting
posture
with
his
feet
in
the
water
just
beginning
was
his
hoarse
response
then
i
must
stay
here
till
it
s
over
shall
we
talk
we
can
said
the
other
without
enthusiasm
maskull
glanced
at
him
through
lids
wondering
if
he
were
exactly
what
he
seemed
to
be
in
his
eyes
he
thought
he
detected
a
wise
light
have
you
travelled
much
polecrab
not
what
you
would
call
you
tell
me
you
ve
been
to
kind
of
country
is
that
i
don
t
know
i
went
there
to
pick
up
what
countries
lie
beyond
it
threal
comes
next
as
you
go
north
they
say
it
s
a
land
of
mystics
i
don
t
mystics
so
i
m
told
still
farther
north
there
s
now
we
re
going
far
there
are
mountains
altogether
it
must
be
a
very
dangerous
place
especially
for
a
man
like
you
take
care
of
this
is
rather
premature
polecrab
how
do
you
know
i
m
going
there
as
you
ve
come
from
the
south
i
suppose
you
ll
go
well
that
s
right
enough
said
maskull
staring
hard
at
him
but
how
do
you
know
i
ve
come
from
the
south
well
then
perhaps
you
haven
there
s
a
look
of
ifdawn
about
what
kind
of
look
a
tragical
look
said
polecrab
he
never
even
glanced
at
maskull
but
was
gazing
at
a
fixed
spot
on
the
water
with
unblinking
eyes
what
lies
beyond
lichstorm
asked
maskull
after
a
minute
or
two
barey
where
you
have
two
suns
instead
of
beyond
that
fact
i
know
nothing
about
it
then
comes
the
and
what
s
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
that
you
must
find
out
for
yourself
for
i
doubt
if
anybody
has
ever
crossed
it
and
come
maskull
was
silent
for
a
little
while
how
is
it
that
your
people
are
so
unadventurous
i
seem
to
be
the
only
one
travelling
from
what
do
you
mean
by
your
people
don
t
know
that
i
don
t
belong
to
your
planet
at
all
i
ve
come
from
another
world
what
to
find
i
came
here
with
krag
and
follow
surtur
i
must
have
fainted
the
moment
i
arrived
when
i
sat
up
it
was
night
and
the
others
had
vanished
since
then
i
ve
been
travelling
at
polecrab
scratched
his
nose
you
haven
t
found
surtur
yet
i
ve
heard
his
drum
taps
frequently
in
the
forest
this
morning
i
came
quite
close
to
him
then
two
days
ago
in
the
lusion
plain
i
saw
a
being
in
man
s
shape
who
called
himself
well
maybe
it
was
no
that
s
impossible
replied
maskull
reflectively
it
was
crystalman
and
it
isn
t
a
question
of
my
suspecting
know
how
because
this
is
crystalman
s
world
and
surtur
s
world
is
something
quite
that
s
queer
then
said
polecrab
since
i
ve
come
out
of
that
forest
proceeded
maskull
talking
half
to
himself
a
change
has
come
over
me
and
i
see
things
differently
everything
here
looks
much
more
solid
and
real
in
my
eyes
than
in
other
places
so
much
so
that
i
can
t
entertain
the
least
doubt
of
its
existence
it
not
only
looks
real
it
is
on
that
i
would
stake
my
life
but
at
the
same
time
that
it
s
real
it
is
like
a
dream
at
all
like
a
dream
and
that
s
just
what
i
want
to
explain
this
world
of
perhaps
of
mine
too
for
that
t
give
me
the
slightest
impression
of
a
dream
or
an
illusion
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
know
it
s
really
here
at
this
moment
and
it
s
exactly
as
we
re
seeing
it
you
and
i
yet
it
s
false
it
s
false
in
this
sense
polecrab
side
by
side
with
it
another
world
exists
and
that
other
world
is
the
true
one
and
this
one
is
all
false
and
deceitful
to
the
very
core
and
so
it
occurs
to
me
that
reality
and
falseness
are
two
words
for
the
same
perhaps
there
is
such
another
world
said
polecrab
huskily
but
did
that
vision
also
seem
real
and
false
to
you
very
real
but
not
false
then
for
then
i
didn
t
understand
all
this
but
just
because
it
was
real
it
couldn
t
have
been
surtur
who
has
no
connection
with
didn
t
those
drum
taps
sound
real
to
you
i
had
to
hear
them
with
my
ears
and
so
they
sounded
real
to
me
still
they
were
somehow
different
and
they
certainly
came
from
surtur
if
i
didn
t
hear
them
correctly
that
was
my
fault
and
not
polecrab
growled
a
little
if
surtur
chooses
to
speak
to
you
in
that
fashion
it
appears
he
s
trying
to
say
what
else
can
i
think
but
polecrab
what
s
your
he
calling
me
to
the
life
after
death
the
old
man
stirred
uneasily
i
m
a
fisherman
he
said
after
a
minute
or
two
i
live
by
killing
and
so
does
everybody
this
life
seems
to
me
all
wrong
so
maybe
life
of
any
kind
is
wrong
and
surtur
s
world
is
not
life
at
all
but
something
yes
but
will
death
lead
me
to
it
whatever
it
is
ask
the
dead
said
polecrab
and
not
a
living
maskull
continued
in
the
forest
i
heard
music
and
saw
a
light
which
could
not
have
belonged
to
this
world
they
were
too
strong
for
my
senses
and
i
must
have
fainted
for
a
long
time
there
was
a
vision
as
well
in
which
i
saw
myself
killed
while
nightspore
walked
on
toward
the
light
polecrab
uttered
his
grunt
you
have
enough
to
think
a
short
silence
ensued
which
was
broken
by
maskull
so
strong
is
my
sense
of
the
untruth
of
this
present
life
that
it
may
come
to
my
putting
an
end
to
the
fisherman
remained
quiet
and
immobile
maskull
lay
on
his
stomach
propped
his
face
on
his
hands
and
stared
at
him
what
do
you
think
polecrab
is
it
possible
for
any
man
while
in
the
body
to
gain
a
closer
view
of
that
other
world
than
i
have
done
i
am
an
ignorant
man
stranger
so
i
can
t
say
perhaps
there
are
many
others
like
you
who
would
gladly
where
i
should
like
to
meet
do
you
think
you
were
made
of
one
stuff
and
the
rest
of
mankind
of
another
stuff
i
can
t
be
so
presumptuous
possibly
all
men
are
reaching
out
toward
muspel
in
most
cases
without
being
aware
of
in
the
wrong
direction
said
polecrab
maskull
gave
him
a
strange
look
how
so
i
don
t
speak
from
my
own
wisdom
said
polecrab
for
i
have
none
but
i
have
just
now
recalled
what
broodviol
once
told
me
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
he
was
an
old
one
he
said
that
crystalman
tries
to
turn
all
things
into
one
and
that
whichever
way
his
shapes
march
in
order
to
escape
from
him
they
find
themselves
again
face
to
face
with
crystalman
and
are
changed
into
new
crystals
but
that
this
marching
of
shapes
which
we
call
forking
springs
from
the
unconscious
desire
to
find
surtur
but
is
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
right
one
for
surtur
s
world
does
not
lie
on
this
side
of
the
one
which
was
the
beginning
of
life
but
on
the
other
side
and
to
get
to
it
we
must
repass
through
the
one
but
this
can
only
be
by
renouncing
our
life
and
reuniting
ourselves
to
the
whole
of
crystalman
s
world
and
when
this
has
been
done
it
is
only
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
though
many
good
men
imagine
it
to
be
the
whole
journey
as
far
as
i
can
remember
that
is
what
broodviol
said
but
perhaps
as
i
was
then
a
young
and
ignorant
man
i
may
have
left
out
words
which
would
explain
his
meaning
maskull
who
had
listened
attentively
to
all
this
remained
thoughtful
at
the
end
it
s
plain
enough
he
said
but
what
did
he
mean
by
our
reuniting
ourselves
to
crystalman
s
world
if
it
is
false
are
we
to
make
ourselves
false
as
well
i
didn
t
ask
him
that
question
and
you
are
as
well
qualified
to
answer
it
as
i
he
must
have
meant
that
as
it
is
we
are
each
of
us
living
in
a
false
private
world
of
our
own
a
world
of
dreams
and
appetites
and
distorted
perceptions
by
embracing
the
great
world
we
certainly
lose
nothing
in
truth
and
polecrab
withdrew
his
feet
from
the
water
stood
up
yawned
and
stretched
his
limbs
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
he
said
in
a
surly
voice
now
let
me
go
to
maskull
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
but
made
no
reply
the
old
man
let
himself
down
stiffly
on
to
the
ground
and
prepared
to
rest
while
he
was
still
arranging
his
position
to
his
liking
a
footfall
sounded
behind
the
two
men
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
forest
maskull
twisted
his
neck
and
saw
a
woman
approaching
them
he
at
once
guessed
that
it
was
polecrab
s
wife
he
sat
up
but
the
fisherman
did
not
stir
the
woman
came
and
stood
in
front
of
them
looking
down
from
what
appeared
a
great
height
her
dress
was
similar
to
her
husband
s
but
covered
her
limbs
more
she
was
young
tall
slender
and
strikingly
erect
her
skin
was
lightly
tanned
and
she
looked
strong
but
not
at
all
peasantlike
refinement
was
stamped
all
over
her
her
face
had
too
much
energy
of
expression
for
a
woman
and
she
was
not
beautiful
her
three
great
eyes
kept
flashing
and
glowing
she
had
great
masses
of
fine
yellow
hair
coiled
up
and
fastened
but
so
carelessly
that
some
of
the
strands
were
flowing
down
her
back
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
rather
weak
voice
but
full
of
lights
and
shades
and
somehow
intense
passionateness
never
seemed
to
be
far
away
from
it
forgiveness
is
asked
for
listening
to
your
conversation
she
said
addressing
maskull
i
was
resting
behind
the
tree
and
heard
it
he
got
up
slowly
are
you
polecrab
s
wife
she
is
my
wife
said
polecrab
and
her
name
is
gleameil
sit
down
again
you
too
wife
since
you
are
they
both
obeyed
i
heard
everything
repeated
gleameil
but
what
i
did
not
hear
was
where
you
are
going
to
maskull
after
you
have
left
i
know
no
more
than
you
listen
then
there
s
only
one
place
for
you
to
go
to
and
that
is
swaylone
s
island
i
will
ferry
you
across
myself
before
what
shall
i
find
there
he
may
go
wife
put
in
the
old
man
hoarsely
but
i
won
t
allow
you
to
go
i
will
take
him
over
no
you
have
always
put
me
off
said
gleameil
with
some
emotion
this
time
i
mean
to
go
when
teargeld
shines
at
night
and
i
sit
on
the
shore
here
listening
to
earthrid
s
music
travelling
faintly
across
the
sea
i
am
can
t
endure
it
i
have
long
since
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
the
island
and
see
what
this
music
is
if
it
s
bad
if
it
kills
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
man
and
his
music
gleameil
demanded
maskull
i
think
the
music
will
answer
all
your
questions
better
than
polecrab
has
possibly
in
a
way
that
will
surprise
what
kind
of
music
can
it
be
to
travel
all
those
miles
across
the
sea
a
peculiar
kind
so
we
are
told
not
pleasant
but
painful
and
the
man
that
can
play
the
instrument
of
earthrid
would
be
able
to
conjure
up
the
most
astonishing
forms
which
are
not
phantasms
but
that
may
be
so
growled
polecrab
but
i
have
been
to
the
island
by
daylight
and
what
did
i
find
there
human
bones
new
and
ancient
those
are
earthrid
s
victims
and
you
wife
shall
not
but
will
that
music
play
tonight
asked
maskull
yes
replied
gleameil
gazing
at
him
intently
when
teargeld
rises
which
is
our
if
earthrid
plays
men
to
death
it
appears
to
me
that
his
own
death
is
due
in
any
case
i
should
like
to
hear
those
sounds
for
myself
but
as
for
taking
you
with
me
die
too
easily
in
tormance
i
have
only
just
now
washed
myself
clean
of
the
death
blood
of
another
gleameil
laughed
but
said
nothing
now
go
to
sleep
said
polecrab
when
the
time
comes
i
will
take
you
across
he
lay
down
again
and
closed
his
eyes
maskull
followed
his
example
but
gleameil
remained
sitting
erect
with
her
legs
under
her
who
was
that
other
woman
maskull
she
asked
presently
he
did
not
answer
but
pretended
to
sleep
chapter
swaylone
s
island
when
he
awoke
the
day
was
not
so
bright
and
he
guessed
it
was
late
afternoon
polecrab
and
his
wife
were
both
on
their
feet
and
another
meal
of
fish
had
been
cooked
and
was
waiting
for
him
is
it
decided
who
is
to
go
with
me
he
asked
before
sitting
down
i
go
said
gleameil
do
you
agree
polecrab
the
fisherman
growled
a
little
in
his
throat
and
motioned
to
the
others
to
take
their
seats
he
took
a
mouthful
before
answering
something
strong
is
attracting
her
and
i
can
t
hold
her
back
i
don
t
think
i
shall
see
you
again
wife
but
the
lads
are
now
nearly
old
enough
to
fend
for
don
t
take
dejected
views
replied
gleameil
sternly
she
was
not
eating
i
shall
come
back
and
make
amends
to
you
it
s
only
for
a
maskull
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
in
perplexity
let
me
go
alone
i
would
be
sorry
if
anything
gleameil
shook
her
head
don
t
regard
this
as
a
woman
s
caprice
she
said
even
if
you
hadn
t
passed
this
way
i
would
have
heard
that
music
soon
i
have
a
hunger
for
haven
t
you
any
such
feeling
polecrab
no
a
woman
is
a
noble
and
sensitive
creature
and
there
are
attractions
in
nature
too
subtle
for
males
take
her
with
you
since
she
is
set
on
it
maybe
she
s
right
perhaps
earthrid
s
music
will
answer
your
questions
and
hers
what
are
your
questions
gleameil
the
woman
shed
a
strange
smile
you
may
be
sure
that
a
question
which
requires
music
for
an
answer
can
t
be
put
into
if
you
are
not
back
by
the
morning
remarked
her
husband
i
will
know
you
are
the
meal
was
finished
in
a
constrained
silence
polecrab
wiped
his
mouth
and
produced
a
seashell
from
a
kind
of
pocket
will
you
say
goodbye
to
the
boys
shall
i
call
them
she
considered
a
moment
i
must
see
he
put
the
shell
to
his
mouth
and
blew
a
loud
mournful
noise
passed
through
the
air
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
a
sound
of
scurrying
footsteps
and
the
boys
were
seen
emerging
from
the
forest
maskull
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
first
children
he
had
seen
on
tormance
the
oldest
boy
was
carrying
the
youngest
on
his
back
while
the
third
trotted
some
distance
behind
the
child
was
let
down
and
all
the
three
formed
a
semicircle
in
front
of
maskull
standing
staring
up
at
him
with
eyes
polecrab
looked
on
stolidly
but
gleameil
glanced
away
from
them
with
proudly
raised
head
and
a
baffling
expression
maskull
put
the
ages
of
the
boys
at
about
nine
seven
and
five
years
respectively
but
he
was
calculating
according
to
earth
time
the
eldest
was
tall
slim
but
strongly
built
he
like
his
brothers
was
naked
and
his
skin
from
top
to
toe
was
his
facial
muscles
indicated
a
wild
and
daring
nature
and
his
eyes
were
like
green
fires
the
second
showed
promise
of
being
a
broad
powerful
man
his
head
was
large
and
heavy
and
drooped
his
face
and
skin
were
reddish
his
eyes
were
almost
too
sombre
and
penetrating
for
a
child
s
that
one
said
polecrab
pinching
the
boy
s
ear
may
perhaps
grow
up
to
be
a
second
who
was
that
demanded
the
boy
bending
his
head
forward
to
hear
the
answer
a
big
old
man
of
marvellous
wisdom
he
became
wise
by
making
up
his
mind
never
to
ask
questions
but
to
find
things
out
for
if
i
had
not
asked
this
question
i
should
not
have
known
about
that
would
not
have
mattered
replied
the
father
the
youngest
child
was
paler
and
slighter
than
his
brothers
his
face
was
mostly
tranquil
and
expressionless
but
it
had
this
peculiarity
about
it
that
every
few
minutes
without
any
apparent
cause
it
would
wrinkle
up
and
look
perplexed
at
these
times
his
eyes
which
were
of
a
tawny
gold
seemed
to
contain
secrets
difficult
to
associate
with
one
of
his
age
he
puzzles
me
said
polecrab
he
has
a
soul
like
sap
and
he
s
interested
in
nothing
he
may
turn
out
to
be
the
most
remarkable
of
the
maskull
took
the
child
in
one
hand
and
lifted
him
as
high
as
his
head
he
took
a
good
look
at
him
and
set
him
down
again
the
boy
never
changed
countenance
what
do
you
make
of
him
asked
the
fisherman
it
s
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
but
it
just
escapes
me
let
me
drink
again
and
then
i
shall
have
go
and
drink
maskull
strode
over
to
the
tree
drank
and
returned
in
ages
to
come
he
said
speaking
deliberately
he
will
be
a
grand
and
awful
tradition
a
seer
possibly
or
even
a
divinity
watch
over
him
the
eldest
boy
looked
scornful
i
want
to
be
none
of
those
things
i
would
like
to
be
like
that
big
and
he
pointed
his
finger
at
maskull
he
laughed
and
showed
his
white
teeth
through
his
beard
thanks
for
the
compliments
old
warrior
he
said
he
s
great
and
brawny
continued
the
boy
and
can
hold
his
own
with
other
men
can
you
hold
me
up
with
one
arm
as
you
did
that
child
maskull
complied
that
is
being
a
man
exclaimed
the
boy
enough
said
polecrab
impatiently
i
called
you
lads
here
to
say
goodbye
to
your
mother
she
is
going
away
with
this
man
i
think
she
may
not
return
but
we
don
t
the
second
boy
s
face
became
suddenly
inflamed
is
she
going
of
her
own
choice
he
inquired
yes
replied
the
father
then
she
is
he
brought
the
words
out
with
such
force
and
emphasis
that
they
sounded
like
the
crack
of
a
whip
the
old
man
cuffed
him
twice
is
it
your
mother
you
are
speaking
of
the
boy
stood
his
ground
without
change
of
expression
but
said
nothing
the
youngest
child
spoke
for
the
first
time
my
mother
will
not
come
back
but
she
will
die
polecrab
and
his
wife
looked
at
one
another
where
are
you
going
to
mother
asked
the
eldest
lad
gleameil
bent
down
and
kissed
him
to
the
well
then
if
you
don
t
come
back
by
tomorrow
morning
i
will
go
and
look
for
maskull
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
in
his
mind
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
man
s
journey
he
said
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
not
to
come
i
am
not
to
be
dissuaded
she
replied
he
stroked
his
beard
in
perplexity
is
it
time
to
start
it
wants
four
hours
to
sunset
and
we
shall
need
all
maskull
sighed
i
ll
go
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
wait
there
for
you
and
the
raft
you
will
wish
to
make
your
farewells
he
then
clasped
polecrab
by
the
hand
adieu
fisherman
you
have
repaid
me
well
for
my
answers
said
the
old
man
gruffly
but
it
s
not
your
fault
and
in
shaping
s
world
the
worst
things
the
eldest
boy
came
close
to
maskull
and
frowned
at
him
farewell
big
man
he
said
but
guard
my
mother
well
as
well
as
you
are
well
able
to
or
i
shall
follow
you
and
kill
maskull
walked
slowly
along
the
creek
bank
till
he
came
to
the
bend
the
glorious
sunshine
and
the
sparkling
brilliant
sea
then
met
his
eyes
again
and
all
melancholy
was
swept
out
of
his
mind
he
continued
as
far
as
the
seashore
and
issuing
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
forest
strolled
on
to
the
sands
and
sat
down
in
the
full
sunlight
the
radiance
of
alppain
had
long
since
disappeared
he
drank
in
the
hot
invigorating
wind
listened
to
the
hissing
waves
and
stared
over
the
coloured
sea
with
its
pinnacles
and
currents
at
swaylone
s
island
what
music
can
that
be
which
tears
a
wife
and
mother
away
from
all
she
loves
the
most
he
meditated
it
sounds
unholy
will
it
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
can
it
in
a
little
while
he
became
aware
of
a
movement
behind
him
and
turning
his
head
he
saw
the
raft
floating
along
the
creek
toward
the
open
sea
polecrab
was
standing
upright
propelling
it
with
a
rude
pole
he
passed
by
maskull
without
looking
at
him
or
making
any
salutation
and
proceeded
out
to
sea
while
he
was
wondering
at
this
strange
behaviour
gleameil
and
the
boys
came
in
sight
walking
along
the
bank
of
the
inlet
the
was
holding
her
hand
and
talking
and
the
other
two
were
behind
she
was
calm
and
smiling
but
seemed
abstracted
what
is
your
husband
doing
with
the
raft
asked
maskull
he
s
putting
it
in
position
and
we
shall
wade
out
and
join
it
she
answered
in
her
voice
but
how
shall
we
make
the
island
without
oars
or
sails
don
t
you
see
that
current
running
away
from
land
see
he
is
approaching
it
that
will
take
us
straight
but
how
can
you
get
back
there
is
a
way
but
we
need
not
think
of
that
why
shouldn
t
i
come
too
demanded
the
eldest
boy
because
the
raft
won
t
carry
three
maskull
is
a
heavy
it
doesn
t
matter
said
the
boy
i
know
where
there
is
wood
for
another
raft
as
soon
as
you
have
gone
i
shall
set
to
polecrab
had
by
this
time
manoeuvred
his
flimsy
craft
to
the
position
he
desired
within
a
few
yards
of
the
current
which
at
that
point
made
a
sharp
bend
from
the
east
he
shouted
out
some
words
to
his
wife
and
maskull
gleameil
kissed
her
children
convulsively
and
broke
down
a
little
the
eldest
boy
bit
his
lip
till
it
bled
and
tears
glistened
in
his
eyes
but
the
younger
children
stared
and
displayed
no
emotion
gleameil
now
walked
into
the
sea
followed
by
maskull
the
water
covered
first
their
ankles
then
their
knees
but
when
it
came
as
high
as
their
waists
they
were
close
on
the
raft
polecrab
let
himself
down
into
the
water
and
assisted
his
wife
to
climb
over
the
side
when
she
was
up
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
no
words
were
exchanged
maskull
scrambled
up
on
to
the
front
part
of
the
raft
the
woman
sat
in
the
stern
and
seized
the
pole
polecrab
shoved
them
off
toward
the
current
while
she
worked
her
pole
until
they
had
got
within
its
power
the
raft
immediately
began
to
travel
swiftly
away
from
land
with
a
smooth
swaying
motion
the
boys
waved
from
the
shore
gleameil
responded
but
maskull
turned
his
back
squarely
to
land
and
gazed
ahead
polecrab
was
wading
back
to
the
shore
for
upward
of
an
hour
maskull
did
not
change
his
position
by
an
inch
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
splashing
of
the
strange
waves
all
around
them
and
the
streamlike
gurgle
of
the
current
which
threaded
its
way
smoothly
through
the
tossing
tumultuous
sea
from
their
pathway
of
safety
the
beautiful
dangers
surrounding
them
were
an
exhilarating
experience
the
air
was
fresh
and
clean
and
the
heat
from
branchspell
now
low
in
the
west
was
at
last
endurable
the
riot
of
sea
colors
had
long
since
banished
all
sadness
and
anxiety
from
his
heart
yet
he
felt
such
a
grudge
against
the
woman
for
selfishly
forsaking
those
who
should
have
been
dear
to
her
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
begin
a
conversation
but
when
over
the
now
enlarged
shape
of
the
dark
island
he
caught
sight
of
a
long
chain
of
lofty
distant
mountains
glowing
in
the
evening
sunlight
he
felt
constrained
to
break
the
silence
by
inquiring
what
they
were
it
is
lichstorm
said
gleameil
maskull
asked
no
questions
about
it
but
in
turning
to
address
her
his
eyes
had
rested
on
the
rapidly
receding
wombflash
forest
and
he
continued
to
stare
at
that
they
had
travelled
about
eight
miles
and
now
he
could
better
estimate
the
enormous
height
of
the
trees
overtopping
them
far
away
he
saw
sant
and
he
fancied
but
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
could
distinguish
disscourn
as
well
now
that
we
are
alone
in
a
strange
place
said
gleameil
averting
her
head
and
looking
down
over
the
side
of
the
raft
into
the
water
tell
me
what
you
thought
of
maskull
paused
before
answering
he
seemed
to
me
like
a
mountain
wrapped
in
cloud
you
see
the
lower
buttresses
and
think
that
is
all
but
then
high
up
far
above
the
clouds
you
suddenly
catch
sight
of
more
even
then
it
is
not
the
you
read
character
well
and
have
great
perception
remarked
gleameil
quietly
now
say
what
i
in
place
of
a
human
heart
you
have
a
wild
harp
and
that
s
all
i
know
about
what
was
that
you
said
to
my
husband
about
two
worlds
you
yes
i
heard
and
i
also
am
conscious
of
two
worlds
my
husband
and
boys
are
real
to
me
and
i
love
them
fondly
but
there
is
another
world
for
me
as
there
is
for
you
maskull
and
it
makes
my
real
world
appear
all
false
and
perhaps
we
are
seeking
the
same
thing
but
can
it
be
right
to
satisfy
our
at
the
expense
of
other
people
no
it
s
not
right
it
is
wrong
and
base
but
in
that
other
world
these
words
have
no
there
was
a
silence
it
s
useless
to
discuss
such
topics
said
maskull
the
choice
is
now
out
of
our
hands
and
we
must
go
where
we
are
taken
what
i
would
rather
speak
about
is
what
awaits
us
on
the
i
am
that
we
shall
find
earthrid
who
is
earthrid
and
why
is
it
called
swaylone
s
island
they
say
earthrid
came
from
threal
but
i
know
nothing
else
about
him
as
for
swaylone
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
his
if
you
please
said
maskull
in
a
age
began
gleameil
when
the
seas
were
hot
and
clouds
hung
heavily
over
the
earth
and
life
was
rich
with
transformations
swaylone
came
to
this
island
on
which
men
had
never
before
set
foot
and
began
to
play
his
first
music
in
tormance
nightly
when
the
moon
shone
people
used
to
gather
on
this
shore
behind
us
and
listen
to
the
faint
sweet
strains
floating
from
over
the
sea
one
night
shaping
whom
you
call
crystalman
was
passing
this
way
in
company
with
krag
they
listened
a
while
to
the
music
and
shaping
said
have
you
heard
more
beautiful
sounds
this
is
my
world
and
my
krag
stamped
with
his
foot
and
laughed
you
must
do
better
than
that
if
i
am
to
admire
it
let
us
pass
over
and
see
this
bungler
at
shaping
consented
and
they
passed
over
to
the
island
swaylone
was
not
able
to
see
their
presence
shaping
stood
behind
him
and
breathed
thoughts
into
his
soul
so
that
his
music
became
ten
times
lovelier
and
people
listening
on
that
shore
went
mad
with
sick
delight
can
any
strains
be
nobler
demanded
shaping
krag
grinned
and
said
you
are
naturally
effeminate
now
let
me
then
he
stood
behind
swaylone
and
shot
ugly
discords
fast
into
his
head
his
instrument
was
so
cracked
that
never
since
has
it
played
right
from
that
time
forth
swaylone
could
utter
only
distorted
music
yet
it
called
to
folk
more
than
the
other
sort
many
men
crossed
over
to
the
island
during
his
lifetime
to
listen
to
the
amazing
tones
but
none
could
endure
them
all
died
after
swaylone
s
death
another
musician
took
up
the
tale
and
so
the
light
has
passed
down
from
torch
to
torch
till
now
earthrid
bears
an
interesting
legend
commented
maskull
but
who
is
krag
they
say
that
when
the
world
was
born
krag
was
born
with
spirit
compounded
of
those
vestiges
of
muspel
which
shaping
did
not
know
how
to
transform
thereafter
nothing
has
gone
right
with
the
world
for
he
dogs
shaping
s
footsteps
everywhere
and
whatever
the
latter
does
he
undoes
to
love
he
joins
death
to
sex
shame
to
intellect
madness
to
virtue
cruelty
and
to
fair
exteriors
bloody
entrails
these
are
krag
s
actions
so
the
lovers
of
the
world
call
him
they
don
t
understand
maskull
that
without
him
the
world
would
lose
its
krag
and
beauty
exclaimed
he
with
a
cynical
smile
even
so
that
same
beauty
which
you
and
i
are
now
voyaging
to
discover
that
beauty
for
whose
sake
i
am
renouncing
husband
children
and
happiness
did
you
imagine
beauty
to
be
pleasant
that
pleasant
beauty
is
an
insipid
compound
of
shaping
to
see
beauty
in
its
terrible
purity
you
must
tear
away
the
pleasure
from
do
you
say
i
am
going
to
seek
beauty
gleameil
such
an
idea
is
far
from
my
she
did
not
respond
to
his
remark
after
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
to
hear
if
she
would
speak
again
he
turned
his
back
on
her
once
more
there
was
no
more
talk
until
they
reached
the
island
the
air
had
grown
chill
and
damp
by
the
time
they
approached
its
shores
branchspell
was
on
the
point
of
touching
the
sea
the
island
appeared
to
be
some
three
or
four
miles
in
length
there
were
first
of
all
broad
sands
then
low
dark
cliffs
and
behind
these
a
wilderness
of
insignificant
swelling
hills
entirely
devoid
of
vegetation
the
current
bore
them
to
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
coast
when
it
made
a
sharp
angle
and
proceeded
to
skirt
the
length
of
the
land
gleameil
jumped
overboard
and
began
swimming
to
shore
maskull
followed
her
example
and
the
raft
abandoned
was
rapidly
borne
away
by
the
current
they
soon
touched
ground
and
were
able
to
wade
the
rest
of
the
way
by
the
time
they
reached
dry
land
the
sun
had
set
gleameil
made
straight
for
the
hills
and
maskull
after
casting
a
single
glance
at
the
low
dim
outline
of
the
wombflash
forest
followed
her
the
cliffs
were
soon
scrambled
up
then
the
ascent
was
gentle
and
easy
while
the
rich
dry
brown
mould
was
good
to
walk
upon
a
little
way
off
on
their
left
something
white
was
shining
you
need
not
go
to
it
said
the
woman
it
can
be
nothing
else
than
one
of
those
skeletons
polecrab
talked
about
and
is
another
one
over
there
this
brings
it
home
remarked
maskull
smiling
there
is
nothing
comical
in
having
died
for
beauty
said
gleameil
bending
her
brows
at
him
and
when
in
the
course
of
their
walk
he
saw
the
innumerable
human
bones
from
gleaming
white
to
dirty
yellow
lying
scattered
about
as
if
it
were
a
naked
graveyard
among
the
hills
he
agreed
with
her
and
fell
into
a
sombre
mood
it
was
still
light
when
they
reached
the
highest
point
and
could
set
eyes
on
the
other
side
the
sea
to
the
north
of
the
island
was
in
no
way
different
from
that
which
they
had
crossed
but
its
lively
colors
were
fast
becoming
invisible
that
is
matterplay
said
the
woman
pointing
her
finger
toward
some
low
land
on
the
horizon
which
seemed
to
be
even
farther
off
than
wombflash
i
wonder
how
digrung
passed
over
meditated
maskull
not
far
away
in
a
hollow
enclosed
by
a
circle
of
little
hills
they
saw
a
small
circular
lake
not
more
than
half
a
mile
in
diameter
the
sunset
colors
of
the
sky
were
reflected
in
its
waters
that
must
be
irontick
remarked
gleameil
what
is
that
i
have
heard
that
it
s
the
instrument
earthrid
plays
we
are
getting
close
responded
he
let
us
go
and
when
they
drew
nearer
they
observed
that
a
man
was
reclining
on
the
farther
side
in
an
attitude
of
sleep
if
that
s
not
the
man
himself
who
can
it
be
said
maskull
let
s
get
across
the
water
if
it
will
bear
us
it
will
save
he
now
assumed
the
lead
and
took
running
strides
down
the
slope
which
bounded
the
lake
on
that
side
gleameil
followed
him
with
greater
dignity
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
recumbent
man
as
if
fascinated
when
maskull
reached
the
water
s
edge
he
tried
it
with
one
foot
to
discover
if
it
would
carry
his
weight
something
unusual
in
its
appearance
led
him
to
have
doubts
it
was
a
tranquil
dark
and
beautifully
reflecting
sheet
of
water
it
resembled
a
mirror
of
liquid
metal
finding
that
it
would
bear
him
and
that
nothing
happened
he
placed
his
second
foot
on
its
surface
instantly
he
sustained
a
violent
shock
throughout
his
body
as
from
a
powerful
electric
current
and
he
was
hurled
in
a
tumbled
heap
back
on
to
the
bank
he
picked
himself
up
brushed
the
dirt
off
his
person
and
started
walking
around
the
lake
gleameil
joined
him
and
they
completed
the
half
circuit
together
they
came
to
the
man
and
maskull
prodded
him
with
his
foot
he
woke
up
and
blinked
at
them
his
face
was
pale
weak
and
and
had
a
disagreeable
expression
there
were
thin
sprouts
of
black
hair
on
his
chin
and
head
on
his
forehead
in
place
of
a
third
eye
he
possessed
a
perfectly
circular
organ
with
elaborate
convolutions
like
an
ear
he
had
an
unpleasant
smell
he
appeared
to
be
of
young
middle
age
wake
up
man
said
maskull
sharply
and
tell
us
if
you
are
what
time
is
it
counterquestioned
the
man
does
it
want
long
to
moonrise
without
appearing
to
care
about
an
answer
he
sat
up
and
turning
away
from
them
began
to
scoop
up
the
loose
soil
with
his
hand
and
to
eat
it
halfheartedly
now
how
can
you
eat
that
filth
demanded
maskull
in
disgust
don
t
be
angry
maskull
said
gleameil
laying
hold
of
his
arm
and
flushing
a
little
it
is
man
who
is
to
help
he
has
not
said
i
am
earthrid
said
the
other
in
his
weak
and
muffled
voice
which
however
suddenly
struck
maskull
as
being
autocratic
what
do
you
want
here
or
rather
you
had
better
get
away
as
quickly
as
you
can
for
it
will
be
too
late
when
teargeld
you
need
not
explain
exclaimed
maskull
we
know
your
reputation
and
we
have
come
to
hear
your
music
but
what
s
that
organ
for
on
your
forehead
earthrid
glared
and
smiled
and
glared
again
that
is
for
rhythm
which
is
what
changes
noise
into
music
don
t
stand
and
argue
but
go
away
it
is
no
pleasure
to
me
to
people
the
island
with
corpses
they
corrupt
the
air
and
do
nothing
darkness
now
crept
swiftly
on
over
the
landscape
you
are
rather
bigmouthed
said
maskull
coolly
but
after
we
have
heard
you
play
perhaps
i
shall
adventure
a
tune
you
are
you
a
musician
then
do
you
even
know
what
music
is
a
flame
danced
in
gleameil
s
eyes
maskull
thinks
music
reposes
in
the
instrument
she
said
in
her
intense
way
but
it
is
in
the
soul
of
the
yes
said
earthrid
but
that
is
not
all
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
in
threal
where
i
was
born
and
brought
up
we
learn
the
mystery
of
the
three
in
nature
this
world
which
lies
extended
before
us
has
three
directions
length
is
the
line
which
shuts
off
what
is
from
what
is
not
breadth
is
the
surface
which
shows
us
in
what
manner
one
thing
of
lives
with
another
thing
depth
is
the
path
which
leads
from
to
our
own
body
in
music
it
is
not
otherwise
tone
is
existence
without
which
nothing
at
all
can
be
symmetry
and
numbers
are
the
manner
in
which
tones
exist
one
with
another
emotion
is
the
movement
of
our
soul
toward
the
wonderful
world
that
is
being
created
now
men
when
they
make
music
are
accustomed
to
build
beautiful
tones
because
of
the
delight
they
cause
therefore
their
music
world
is
based
on
pleasure
its
symmetry
is
regular
and
charming
its
emotion
is
sweet
and
lovely
but
my
music
is
founded
on
painful
tones
and
thus
its
symmetry
is
wild
and
difficult
to
discover
its
emotion
is
bitter
and
if
i
had
not
anticipated
its
being
original
i
would
not
have
come
here
said
maskull
still
can
t
harsh
tones
have
simple
symmetry
of
form
and
why
must
they
necessarily
cause
more
profound
emotions
in
us
who
listen
pleasures
may
harmonise
pains
must
clash
and
in
the
order
of
their
clashing
lies
the
symmetry
the
emotions
follow
the
music
which
is
rough
and
you
may
call
it
music
remarked
maskull
thoughtfully
but
to
me
it
bears
a
closer
resemblance
to
actual
if
shaping
s
plans
had
gone
straight
life
would
have
been
like
that
other
sort
of
music
he
who
seeks
can
find
traces
of
that
intention
in
the
world
of
nature
but
as
it
has
turned
out
real
life
resembles
my
music
and
mine
is
the
true
shall
we
see
living
shapes
i
don
t
know
what
my
mood
will
be
returned
earthrid
but
when
i
have
finished
you
shall
adventure
your
tune
and
produce
whatever
shapes
you
indeed
the
tune
is
out
of
your
own
big
the
shocks
you
are
preparing
may
kill
us
said
gleameil
in
a
low
taut
voice
but
we
shall
die
seeing
earthrid
looked
at
her
with
a
dignified
expression
neither
you
nor
any
other
person
can
endure
the
thoughts
which
i
put
into
my
music
still
you
must
have
it
your
own
way
it
needed
a
woman
to
call
it
but
if
this
is
beauty
what
is
ugliness
that
i
can
tell
you
master
replied
gleameil
smiling
at
him
ugliness
is
old
stale
life
while
yours
every
night
issues
fresh
from
the
womb
of
earthrid
stared
at
her
without
response
teargeld
is
rising
he
said
at
last
and
now
you
shall
not
for
as
the
words
left
his
mouth
the
full
moon
peeped
over
the
hills
in
the
dark
eastern
sky
they
watched
it
in
silence
and
soon
it
was
wholly
up
it
was
larger
than
the
moon
of
earth
and
seemed
nearer
its
shadowy
parts
stood
out
in
just
as
strong
relief
but
somehow
it
did
not
give
maskull
the
impression
of
being
a
dead
world
branchspell
shone
on
the
whole
of
it
but
alppain
only
on
a
part
the
broad
crescent
that
reflected
branchspell
s
rays
alone
was
white
and
brilliant
but
the
part
that
was
illuminated
by
both
suns
shone
with
a
greenish
radiance
that
had
almost
solar
power
and
yet
was
cold
and
cheerless
on
gazing
at
that
combined
light
he
felt
the
same
sense
of
disintegration
that
the
afterglow
of
alppain
had
always
caused
in
him
but
now
the
feeling
was
not
physical
but
merely
aesthetic
the
moon
did
not
appear
romantic
to
him
but
disturbing
and
mystical
earthrid
rose
and
stood
quietly
for
a
minute
in
the
bright
moonlight
his
face
seemed
to
have
undergone
a
change
it
lost
its
loose
weak
disagreeable
look
and
acquired
a
sort
of
crafty
grandeur
he
clapped
his
hands
together
meditatively
two
or
three
times
and
walked
up
and
down
the
others
stood
together
watching
him
then
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
lake
and
leaning
on
his
side
placed
his
right
hand
open
palm
downward
on
the
ground
at
the
same
time
stretching
out
his
right
leg
so
that
the
foot
was
in
contact
with
the
water
while
maskull
was
in
the
act
of
staring
at
him
and
at
the
lake
he
felt
a
stabbing
sensation
right
through
his
heart
as
though
he
had
been
pierced
by
a
rapier
he
barely
recovered
himself
from
falling
and
as
he
did
so
he
saw
that
a
spout
had
formed
on
the
water
and
was
now
subsiding
again
the
next
moment
he
was
knocked
down
by
a
violent
blow
in
the
mouth
delivered
by
an
invisible
hand
he
picked
himself
up
and
observed
that
a
second
spout
had
formed
no
sooner
was
he
on
his
legs
than
a
hideous
pain
hammered
away
inside
his
brain
as
if
caused
by
a
malignant
tumour
in
his
agony
he
stumbled
and
fell
again
this
time
on
the
arm
krag
had
wounded
all
his
other
mishaps
were
forgotten
in
this
one
which
half
stunned
him
it
lasted
only
a
moment
and
then
sudden
relief
came
and
he
found
that
earthrid
s
rough
music
had
lost
its
power
over
him
he
saw
him
still
stretched
in
the
same
position
spouts
were
coming
thick
and
fast
on
the
lake
which
was
full
of
lively
motion
but
gleameil
was
not
on
her
legs
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
in
a
heap
without
moving
her
attitude
was
ugly
and
he
guessed
she
was
dead
when
he
reached
her
he
discovered
that
she
was
dead
in
what
state
of
mind
she
had
died
he
did
not
know
for
her
face
wore
the
vulgar
crystalman
grin
the
whole
tragedy
had
not
lasted
five
minutes
he
went
over
to
earthrid
and
dragged
him
forcibly
away
from
his
playing
you
have
been
as
good
as
your
word
musician
he
said
gleameil
is
earthrid
tried
to
collect
his
scattered
senses
i
warned
her
he
replied
sitting
up
did
i
not
beg
her
to
go
away
but
she
died
very
easily
she
did
not
wait
for
the
beauty
she
spoke
about
she
heard
nothing
of
the
passion
nor
even
of
the
rhythm
neither
have
maskull
looked
down
at
him
in
indignation
but
said
nothing
you
should
not
have
interrupted
me
went
on
earthrid
when
i
am
playing
nothing
else
is
of
importance
i
might
have
lost
the
thread
of
my
ideas
fortunately
i
never
forget
i
shall
start
over
if
music
is
to
continue
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
i
play
the
man
glanced
up
quickly
that
can
t
it
must
be
said
maskull
decisively
i
prefer
playing
to
listening
another
reason
is
that
you
will
have
every
night
but
i
have
only
earthrid
clenched
and
unclenched
his
fist
and
began
to
turn
pale
with
your
recklessness
you
are
likely
to
kill
us
both
irontick
belongs
to
me
and
until
you
have
learned
how
to
play
you
would
only
break
the
well
then
i
will
break
it
but
i
am
going
to
the
musician
jumped
to
his
feet
and
confronted
him
do
you
intend
to
take
it
from
me
by
violence
keep
calm
you
will
have
the
same
choice
that
you
offered
us
i
shall
give
you
time
to
go
away
how
will
that
serve
me
if
you
spoil
my
lake
you
don
t
understand
what
you
are
go
or
stay
responded
maskull
i
give
you
till
the
water
gets
smooth
again
after
that
i
begin
earthrid
kept
swallowing
he
glanced
at
the
lake
and
back
to
maskull
do
you
swear
it
how
long
that
will
take
you
know
better
than
i
but
till
then
you
are
earthrid
cast
him
a
look
of
malice
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
moved
away
and
started
to
climb
the
nearest
hill
halfway
up
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
apprehensively
as
if
to
see
what
was
happening
in
another
minute
or
so
he
had
disappeared
over
the
crest
travelling
in
the
direction
of
the
shore
that
faced
matterplay
later
when
the
water
was
once
more
tranquil
maskull
sat
down
by
its
edge
in
imitation
of
earthrid
s
attitude
he
knew
neither
how
to
set
about
producing
his
music
nor
what
would
come
of
it
but
audacious
projects
entered
his
brain
and
he
willed
to
create
physical
above
all
one
shape
that
of
surtur
before
putting
his
foot
to
the
water
he
turned
things
over
a
little
in
his
mind
he
said
what
themes
are
in
common
music
shapes
are
in
this
music
the
composer
does
not
find
his
theme
by
picking
out
single
notes
but
the
whole
theme
flashes
into
his
mind
by
inspiration
so
it
must
be
with
shapes
when
i
start
playing
if
i
am
worth
anything
the
undivided
ideas
will
pass
from
my
unconscious
mind
to
this
lake
and
then
reflected
back
in
the
dimensions
of
reality
i
shall
be
for
the
first
time
made
acquainted
with
them
so
it
must
the
instant
his
foot
touched
the
water
he
felt
his
thoughts
flowing
from
him
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
but
the
mere
act
of
flowing
created
a
sensation
of
joyful
mastery
with
this
was
curiosity
to
learn
what
they
would
prove
to
be
spouts
formed
on
the
lake
in
increasing
numbers
but
he
experienced
no
pain
his
thoughts
which
he
knew
to
be
music
did
not
issue
from
him
in
a
steady
unbroken
stream
but
in
great
rough
gushes
succeeding
intervals
of
quiescence
when
these
gushes
came
the
whole
lake
broke
out
in
an
eruption
of
spouts
he
realised
that
the
ideas
passing
from
him
did
not
arise
in
his
intellect
but
had
their
source
in
the
fathomless
depths
of
his
will
he
could
not
decide
what
character
they
should
have
but
he
was
able
to
force
them
out
or
retard
them
by
the
exercise
of
his
volition
at
first
nothing
changed
around
him
then
the
moon
grew
dimmer
and
a
strange
new
radiance
began
to
illuminate
the
landscape
it
increased
so
imperceptibly
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
recognised
it
as
the
which
he
had
seen
in
the
wombflash
forest
he
could
not
give
it
a
colour
or
a
name
but
it
filled
him
with
a
sort
of
stern
and
sacred
awe
he
called
up
the
resources
of
his
powerful
will
the
spouts
thickened
like
a
forest
and
many
of
them
were
twenty
feet
high
teargeld
looked
faint
and
pale
the
radiance
became
intense
but
it
cast
no
shadows
the
wind
got
up
but
where
maskull
was
sitting
it
was
calm
shortly
afterward
it
began
to
shriek
and
whistle
like
a
full
gale
he
saw
no
shapes
and
redoubled
his
efforts
his
ideas
were
now
rushing
out
onto
the
lake
so
furiously
that
his
whole
soul
was
possessed
by
exhilaration
and
defiance
but
still
he
did
not
know
their
nature
a
huge
spout
shot
up
and
at
the
same
moment
the
hills
began
to
crack
and
break
great
masses
of
loose
soil
were
erupted
from
their
bowels
and
in
the
next
period
of
quietness
he
saw
that
the
landscape
had
altered
still
the
mysterious
light
intensified
the
moon
disappeared
entirely
the
noise
of
the
unseen
tempest
was
terrifying
but
maskull
played
heroically
on
trying
to
urge
out
ideas
which
would
take
shape
the
hillsides
were
cleft
with
chasms
the
water
escaping
from
the
tops
of
the
spouts
swamped
the
land
but
where
he
was
it
was
dry
the
radiance
grew
terrible
it
was
everywhere
but
maskull
fancied
that
it
was
far
brighter
in
one
particular
quarter
he
thought
that
it
was
becoming
localised
preparatory
to
contracting
into
a
solid
form
he
strained
and
strained
immediately
afterward
the
bottom
of
the
lake
subsided
its
waters
fell
through
and
his
instrument
was
broken
the
vanished
the
moon
shone
out
again
but
maskull
could
not
see
it
after
that
unearthly
shining
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
in
total
blackness
the
screaming
wind
ceased
there
was
a
dead
silence
his
thoughts
finished
flowing
toward
the
lake
and
his
foot
no
longer
touched
water
but
hung
in
space
he
was
too
stunned
by
the
suddenness
of
the
change
to
either
think
or
feel
while
he
was
still
lying
dazed
a
vast
explosion
occurred
in
the
newly
opened
depths
beneath
the
lakebed
the
water
in
its
descent
had
met
fire
maskull
was
lifted
bodily
in
the
air
many
yards
high
and
came
down
heavily
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
came
to
his
senses
again
he
saw
everything
teargeld
was
gleaming
brilliantly
he
was
lying
by
the
side
of
the
old
lake
but
it
was
now
a
crater
to
the
bottom
of
which
his
eyes
could
not
penetrate
the
hills
encircling
it
were
torn
as
if
by
heavy
gunfire
a
few
thunderclouds
were
floating
in
the
air
at
no
great
height
from
which
branched
lightning
descended
to
the
earth
incessantly
accompanied
by
alarming
and
singular
crashes
he
got
on
his
legs
and
tested
his
actions
finding
that
he
was
uninjured
he
first
of
all
viewed
the
crater
at
closer
quarters
and
then
started
to
walk
painfully
toward
the
northern
shore
when
he
had
attained
the
crest
above
the
lake
the
landscape
sloped
gently
down
for
two
miles
to
the
sea
everywhere
he
passed
through
traces
of
his
rough
work
the
country
was
carved
into
scarps
grooves
channels
and
craters
he
arrived
at
the
line
of
low
cliffs
overlooking
the
beach
and
found
that
these
also
were
partly
broken
down
by
landslips
he
got
down
onto
the
sand
and
stood
looking
over
the
moonlit
agitated
sea
wondering
how
he
could
contrive
to
escape
from
this
island
of
failure
then
he
saw
earthrid
s
body
lying
quite
close
to
him
it
was
on
its
back
both
legs
had
been
violently
torn
off
and
he
could
not
see
them
anywhere
earthrid
s
teeth
were
buried
in
the
flesh
of
his
right
forearm
indicating
that
the
man
had
died
in
unreasoning
physical
agony
the
skin
gleamed
green
in
the
moonlight
but
it
was
stained
by
darker
discolourations
which
were
wounds
the
sand
about
him
was
dyed
by
the
pool
of
blood
which
had
long
since
filtered
through
maskull
left
the
corpse
in
dismay
and
walked
a
long
way
along
the
shore
sitting
down
on
a
rock
he
waited
for
daybreak
chapter
leehallfae
at
midnight
when
teargeld
was
in
the
south
throwing
his
shadow
straight
toward
the
sea
and
making
everything
nearly
as
bright
as
day
he
saw
a
great
tree
floating
in
the
water
not
far
out
it
was
thirty
feet
out
of
the
water
upright
and
alive
and
its
roots
must
have
been
enormously
deep
and
wide
it
was
drifting
along
the
coast
through
the
heavy
seas
maskull
eyed
it
incuriously
for
a
few
minutes
then
it
dawned
on
him
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
to
investigate
its
nature
without
stopping
to
weigh
the
danger
he
immediately
swam
out
caught
hold
of
the
lowest
branch
and
swung
himself
up
he
looked
aloft
and
saw
that
the
main
stem
was
thick
to
the
very
top
terminating
in
a
knob
that
somewhat
resembled
a
human
head
he
made
his
way
toward
this
knob
through
the
multitude
of
boughs
which
were
covered
with
tough
slippery
marine
leaves
like
seaweed
arriving
at
the
crown
he
found
that
it
actually
was
a
sort
of
head
for
there
were
membranes
like
rudimentary
eyes
all
the
way
around
it
denoting
some
form
of
low
intelligence
at
that
moment
the
tree
touched
bottom
though
some
way
from
the
shore
and
began
to
bump
heavily
to
steady
himself
maskull
put
his
hand
out
and
in
doing
so
accidentally
covered
some
of
the
membranes
the
tree
sheered
off
the
land
as
if
by
an
act
of
will
when
it
was
steady
again
maskull
removed
his
hand
they
at
once
drifted
back
to
shore
he
thought
a
bit
and
then
started
experimenting
with
the
eyelike
membranes
it
was
as
he
had
eyes
were
stimulated
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
whichever
way
the
light
came
from
the
tree
would
travel
a
rather
defiant
smile
crossed
maskull
s
face
as
it
struck
him
that
it
might
be
possible
to
navigate
this
huge
as
far
as
matterplay
he
lost
no
time
in
putting
the
conception
into
execution
tearing
off
some
of
the
long
tough
leaves
he
bound
up
all
the
membranes
except
the
ones
that
faced
the
north
the
tree
instantly
left
the
island
and
definitely
put
out
to
sea
it
travelled
due
north
it
was
not
moving
at
more
than
a
mile
an
hour
however
while
matterplay
was
possibly
forty
miles
distant
the
great
spout
waves
fell
against
the
trunk
with
mighty
thuds
the
breaking
seas
hissed
through
the
lower
rested
high
and
dry
but
was
more
than
a
little
apprehensive
about
their
slow
rate
of
progress
presently
he
sighted
a
current
racing
along
toward
the
west
and
that
put
another
idea
into
his
head
he
began
to
juggle
with
the
membranes
again
and
before
long
had
succeeded
in
piloting
his
tree
into
the
stream
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
in
its
rapids
he
blinded
the
crown
entirely
and
thenceforward
the
current
acted
in
the
double
capacity
of
road
and
steed
maskull
made
himself
secure
among
the
branches
and
slept
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
when
his
eyes
opened
again
the
island
was
out
of
sight
teargeld
was
setting
in
the
western
sea
the
sky
in
the
east
was
bright
with
the
colours
of
the
approaching
day
the
air
was
cool
and
fresh
the
light
over
the
sea
was
beautiful
gleaming
and
mysterious
ahead
a
long
dark
line
of
low
cliffs
perhaps
a
mile
away
the
current
no
longer
ran
toward
the
shore
but
began
to
skirt
the
coast
without
drawing
any
closer
to
it
as
soon
as
maskull
realised
the
fact
he
manoeuvred
the
tree
out
of
its
channel
and
started
drifting
it
inshore
the
eastern
sky
blazed
up
suddenly
with
violent
dyes
and
the
outer
rim
of
branchspell
lifted
itself
above
the
sea
the
moon
had
already
sunk
the
shore
loomed
nearer
and
nearer
in
physical
character
it
was
like
swaylone
s
same
wide
sands
small
cliffs
and
rounded
insignificant
hills
inland
without
vegetation
in
the
sunlight
however
it
looked
romantic
maskull
and
morose
cared
nothing
for
all
that
but
the
moment
the
tree
grounded
clambered
swiftly
down
through
the
branches
and
dropped
into
the
sea
by
the
time
he
had
swam
ashore
the
white
stupendous
sun
was
high
above
the
horizon
he
walked
along
the
sands
toward
the
east
for
a
considerable
distance
without
having
any
special
intention
in
his
mind
he
thought
he
would
go
on
until
he
came
to
some
creek
or
valley
and
then
turn
up
it
the
sun
s
rays
were
cheering
and
began
to
relieve
him
of
his
oppressive
night
weight
after
strolling
along
the
beach
for
about
a
mile
he
was
stopped
by
a
broad
stream
that
flowed
into
the
sea
out
of
a
kind
of
natural
gateway
in
the
line
of
cliffs
its
water
was
of
a
beautiful
limpid
green
all
filled
with
bubbles
so
aerated
and
enticing
did
it
look
that
he
flung
himself
face
downward
on
the
ground
and
took
a
prolonged
draught
when
he
got
up
again
his
eyes
started
to
play
became
alternately
blurred
and
clear
it
may
have
been
pure
imagination
but
he
fancied
that
digrung
was
moving
inside
him
he
followed
the
bank
of
the
stream
through
the
gap
in
the
cliffs
and
then
for
the
first
time
saw
the
real
matterplay
a
valley
appeared
like
a
jewel
enveloped
by
naked
rock
all
the
hill
country
was
bare
and
lifeless
but
this
valley
lying
in
the
heart
of
it
was
extremely
fertile
he
had
never
seen
such
fertility
it
wound
up
among
the
hills
and
all
that
he
was
looking
at
was
its
broad
lower
end
the
floor
of
the
valley
was
about
half
a
mile
wide
the
stream
that
ran
down
its
middle
was
nearly
a
hundred
feet
across
but
was
exceedingly
most
places
not
more
than
a
few
inches
deep
the
sides
of
the
valley
were
about
seventy
feet
high
but
very
sloping
they
were
clothed
from
top
to
bottom
with
little
of
varied
tints
of
one
colour
like
earth
trees
but
of
widely
diverse
colours
most
of
which
were
brilliant
and
positive
the
floor
itself
was
like
a
magician
s
garden
densely
interwoven
trees
shrubs
and
parasitical
climbers
fought
everywhere
for
possession
of
it
the
forms
were
strange
and
grotesque
and
each
one
seemed
different
the
colours
of
leaf
flower
sexual
organs
and
stem
were
equally
the
different
combinations
of
the
five
primary
colours
of
tormance
seemed
to
be
represented
and
the
result
for
maskull
was
a
sort
of
eye
chaos
so
rank
was
the
vegetation
that
he
could
not
fight
his
way
through
it
he
was
obliged
to
take
to
the
riverbed
the
contact
of
the
water
created
an
odd
tingling
sensation
throughout
his
body
like
a
mild
electric
shock
there
were
no
birds
but
a
few
looking
winged
reptiles
of
small
size
kept
crossing
the
valley
from
hill
to
hill
swarms
of
flying
insects
clustered
around
him
threatening
mischief
but
in
the
end
it
turned
out
that
his
blood
was
disagreeable
to
them
for
he
was
not
bitten
once
repulsive
crawling
creatures
resembling
centipedes
scorpions
snakes
and
so
forth
were
in
myriads
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
but
they
also
made
no
attempt
to
use
their
weapons
on
his
bare
legs
and
feet
as
he
passed
through
them
into
the
water
presently
however
he
was
confronted
in
midstream
by
a
hideous
monster
of
the
size
of
a
pony
but
resembling
in
it
resembled
sea
crustacean
and
then
he
came
to
a
halt
they
stared
at
one
another
the
beast
with
wicked
eyes
maskull
with
cool
and
wary
ones
while
he
was
staring
a
singular
thing
happened
to
him
his
eyes
blurred
again
but
when
in
a
minute
or
two
this
blurring
passed
away
and
he
saw
clearly
once
more
his
vision
had
changed
in
character
he
was
looking
right
through
the
animal
s
body
and
could
distinguish
all
its
interior
parts
the
outer
crust
however
and
all
the
hard
tissues
were
misty
and
through
them
a
luminous
network
of
veins
and
arteries
stood
out
in
startling
distinctness
the
hard
parts
faded
away
to
nothingness
and
the
blood
system
alone
was
left
not
even
the
fleshy
ducts
remained
the
naked
blood
alone
was
visible
flowing
this
way
and
that
like
a
fiery
liquid
skeleton
in
the
shape
of
the
monster
then
this
blood
began
to
change
too
instead
of
a
continuous
liquid
stream
maskull
perceived
that
it
was
composed
of
a
million
individual
points
the
red
colour
had
been
an
illusion
caused
by
the
rapid
motion
of
the
points
he
now
saw
clearly
that
they
resembled
minute
suns
in
their
scintillating
brightness
they
seemed
like
a
double
drift
of
stars
streaming
through
space
one
drift
was
travelling
toward
a
fixed
point
in
the
centre
while
the
other
was
moving
away
from
it
he
recognised
the
former
as
the
veins
of
the
beast
the
latter
as
the
arteries
and
the
fixed
point
as
the
heart
while
he
was
still
looking
lost
in
amazement
the
starry
network
went
out
suddenly
like
an
extinguished
flame
where
the
crustacean
had
stood
there
was
nothing
yet
through
this
nothing
he
could
not
see
the
landscape
something
was
standing
there
that
intercepted
the
light
though
it
possessed
neither
shape
colour
nor
substance
and
now
the
object
which
could
no
longer
be
perceived
by
vision
began
to
be
felt
by
emotion
a
delightful
springlike
sense
of
rising
sap
of
quickening
pulses
of
love
adventure
mystery
beauty
possession
of
his
being
and
strangely
enough
he
identified
it
with
the
monster
why
that
invisible
brute
should
cause
him
to
feel
young
sexual
and
audacious
he
did
not
ask
himself
for
he
was
fully
occupied
with
the
effect
but
it
was
as
if
flesh
bones
and
blood
had
been
discarded
and
he
were
face
to
face
with
naked
life
itself
which
slowly
passed
into
his
own
body
the
sensations
died
away
there
was
a
brief
interval
and
then
the
streaming
starlike
skeleton
rose
up
again
out
of
space
it
changed
to
the
system
the
hard
parts
of
the
body
reappeared
with
more
and
more
distinctness
and
at
the
same
time
the
network
of
blood
grew
fainter
presently
the
interior
parts
were
entirely
concealed
by
the
creature
stood
opposite
maskull
in
its
old
formidable
ugliness
hard
painted
and
concrete
disliking
something
about
him
the
crustacean
turned
aside
and
stumbled
awkwardly
away
on
its
six
legs
with
laborious
and
repulsive
movements
toward
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
maskull
s
apathy
left
him
after
this
adventure
he
became
uneasy
and
thoughtful
he
imagined
that
he
was
beginning
to
see
things
through
digrung
s
eyes
and
that
there
were
strange
troubles
immediately
ahead
the
next
time
his
eyes
started
to
blur
he
fought
it
down
with
his
will
and
nothing
happened
the
valley
ascended
with
many
windings
toward
the
hills
it
narrowed
considerably
and
the
wooded
slopes
on
either
side
grew
steeper
and
higher
the
stream
shrunk
to
about
twenty
feet
across
but
it
was
was
alive
with
motion
music
and
bubbles
the
electric
sensations
caused
by
its
water
became
more
pronounced
almost
disagreeably
so
but
there
was
nowhere
else
to
walk
with
its
deafening
confusion
of
sounds
from
the
multitude
of
living
creatures
the
little
valley
resembled
a
vast
conversation
hall
of
nature
the
life
was
still
more
prolific
than
before
every
square
foot
of
space
was
a
tangle
of
struggling
wills
both
animal
and
vegetable
for
a
naturalist
it
would
have
been
paradise
for
no
two
shapes
were
alike
and
all
were
fantastic
with
individual
character
it
looked
as
if
life
forms
were
being
coined
so
fast
by
nature
that
there
was
not
physical
room
for
all
nevertheless
it
was
not
as
on
earth
where
a
hundred
seeds
are
scattered
in
order
that
one
may
be
sown
here
the
young
forms
seemed
to
survive
while
to
find
accommodation
for
them
the
old
ones
perished
everywhere
he
looked
they
were
withering
and
dying
without
any
ostensible
were
simply
being
killed
by
new
life
other
creatures
sported
so
wildly
in
front
of
his
very
eyes
that
they
became
of
different
kingdoms
altogether
for
example
a
fruit
was
lying
on
the
ground
of
the
size
and
shape
of
a
lemon
but
with
a
tougher
skin
he
picked
it
up
intending
to
eat
the
contained
pulp
but
inside
it
was
a
fully
formed
young
tree
just
on
the
point
of
bursting
its
shell
maskull
threw
it
away
upstream
it
floated
back
toward
him
by
the
time
he
was
even
with
it
its
downward
motion
had
stopped
and
it
was
swimming
against
the
current
he
fished
it
out
and
discovered
that
it
had
sprouted
six
rudimentary
legs
maskull
sang
no
paeans
of
praise
in
honour
of
the
gloriously
overcrowded
valley
on
the
contrary
he
felt
deeply
cynical
and
depressed
he
thought
that
the
unseen
it
was
called
nature
life
will
or
was
so
frantic
to
rush
forward
and
occupy
this
small
vulgar
contemptible
world
could
not
possess
very
high
aims
and
was
not
worth
much
how
this
sordid
struggle
for
an
hour
or
two
of
physical
existence
could
ever
be
regarded
as
a
deeply
earnest
and
important
business
was
beyond
his
comprehension
the
atmosphere
choked
him
he
longed
for
air
and
space
thrusting
his
way
through
to
the
side
of
the
ravine
he
began
to
climb
the
overhanging
cliff
swinging
his
way
up
from
tree
to
tree
when
he
arrived
at
the
top
branchspell
beat
down
on
him
with
such
brutal
white
intensity
that
he
saw
that
there
was
no
staying
there
he
looked
around
to
ascertain
what
part
of
the
country
he
had
come
to
he
had
travelled
about
ten
miles
from
the
sea
as
the
crow
flies
the
bare
undulating
wolds
sloped
straight
down
toward
it
the
water
glittered
in
the
distance
and
on
the
horizon
he
was
just
able
to
make
out
swaylone
s
island
looking
north
the
land
continued
sloping
upward
as
far
as
he
could
see
over
the
is
to
say
some
miles
line
of
black
rocks
of
quite
another
character
showed
themselves
this
was
probably
threal
behind
these
again
against
the
sky
perhaps
fifty
or
even
a
hundred
miles
off
were
the
peaks
of
lichstorm
most
of
them
covered
with
greenish
snow
that
glittered
in
the
sunlight
they
were
stupendously
high
and
of
weird
contours
most
of
them
were
conical
to
the
top
but
from
the
top
great
masses
of
mountain
balanced
themselves
at
what
looked
like
impossible
without
apparent
support
a
land
like
that
promised
something
new
he
thought
extraordinary
inhabitants
the
idea
took
shape
in
his
mind
to
go
there
and
to
travel
as
swiftly
as
possible
it
might
even
be
feasible
to
get
there
before
sunset
it
was
less
the
mountains
themselves
that
attracted
him
than
the
country
which
lay
prospect
of
setting
eyes
on
the
blue
sun
which
he
judged
to
be
the
wonder
of
wonders
in
tormance
the
direct
route
was
over
the
hills
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
because
of
the
killing
heat
and
the
absence
of
shade
he
guessed
however
that
the
valley
would
not
take
him
far
out
of
his
way
and
decided
to
keep
to
that
for
the
time
being
much
as
he
hated
and
feared
it
into
the
hotbed
of
life
therefore
he
once
more
swung
himself
once
down
he
continued
to
follow
the
windings
of
the
valley
for
several
miles
through
sunlight
and
shadow
the
path
became
increasingly
difficult
the
cliffs
closed
in
on
either
side
until
they
were
less
than
a
hundred
yards
apart
while
the
bed
of
the
ravine
was
blocked
by
boulders
great
and
small
so
that
the
little
stream
which
was
now
diminished
to
the
proportions
of
a
brook
had
to
come
down
where
and
how
it
could
the
forms
of
life
grew
stranger
pure
plants
and
pure
animals
disappeared
by
degrees
and
their
place
was
filled
by
singular
creatures
that
seemed
to
partake
of
both
characters
they
had
limbs
faces
will
and
intelligence
but
they
remained
for
the
greater
part
of
their
time
rooted
in
the
ground
by
preference
and
they
fed
only
on
soil
and
air
maskull
saw
no
sexual
organs
and
failed
to
understand
how
the
young
came
into
existence
then
he
witnessed
an
astonishing
sight
a
large
and
fully
developed
appeared
suddenly
in
front
of
him
out
of
empty
space
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
but
stared
at
the
creature
for
a
long
time
in
amazement
it
went
on
calmly
moving
and
burrowing
before
him
as
thought
it
had
been
there
all
its
life
giving
up
the
puzzle
maskull
resumed
his
striding
from
rock
to
rock
up
the
gorge
and
then
quietly
and
without
warning
the
same
phenomenon
occurred
again
no
longer
could
he
doubt
that
he
was
seeing
nature
was
precipitating
its
shapes
into
the
world
without
making
use
of
the
medium
of
parentage
no
solution
of
the
problem
presented
itself
the
brook
too
had
altered
in
character
a
trembling
radiance
came
up
from
its
green
water
like
some
imprisoned
force
escaping
into
the
air
he
had
not
walked
in
it
for
some
time
now
he
did
so
to
test
its
quality
he
felt
new
life
entering
his
body
from
his
feet
upward
it
resembled
a
slowly
moving
cordial
rather
than
mere
heat
the
sensation
was
quite
new
in
his
experience
yet
he
knew
by
instinct
what
it
was
the
energy
emitted
by
the
brook
was
ascending
his
body
neither
as
friend
nor
foe
but
simply
because
it
happened
to
be
the
direct
road
to
its
objective
elsewhere
but
although
it
had
no
hostile
intentions
it
was
likely
to
prove
a
rough
was
clearly
conscious
that
its
passage
through
his
body
threatened
to
bring
about
some
physical
transformation
unless
he
could
do
something
to
prevent
it
leaping
quickly
out
of
the
water
he
leaned
against
a
rock
tightened
his
muscles
and
braced
himself
against
the
impending
change
at
that
very
moment
the
blurring
again
attacked
his
sight
and
while
he
was
guarding
against
that
his
forehead
sprouted
out
into
a
galaxy
of
new
eyes
he
put
his
hand
up
and
counted
six
in
addition
to
his
old
ones
the
danger
was
past
and
maskull
laughed
congratulating
himself
on
having
got
off
so
easily
then
he
wondered
what
the
new
organs
were
they
were
a
good
or
a
bad
thing
he
had
not
taken
a
dozen
steps
up
the
ravine
before
he
found
out
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
jumping
down
from
the
top
of
a
boulder
his
vision
altered
and
he
came
to
an
automatic
standstill
he
was
perceiving
two
worlds
simultaneously
with
his
own
eyes
he
saw
the
gorge
as
before
with
its
rocks
brook
sunshine
and
shadows
but
with
his
acquired
eyes
he
saw
differently
all
the
details
of
the
valley
were
visible
but
the
light
seemed
turned
down
and
everything
appeared
faint
hard
and
uncoloured
the
sun
was
obscured
by
masses
of
cloud
which
filled
the
whole
sky
this
vapour
was
in
violent
and
almost
living
motion
it
was
thick
in
extension
but
thin
in
texture
some
parts
however
were
far
denser
than
others
as
the
particles
were
crushed
together
or
swept
apart
by
the
motion
the
green
sparks
from
the
brook
when
closely
watched
could
be
distinguished
individually
each
one
wavering
up
toward
the
clouds
but
the
moment
they
got
within
them
a
fearful
struggle
seemed
to
begin
the
spark
endeavoured
to
escape
through
to
the
upper
air
while
the
clouds
concentrated
around
it
whichever
way
it
darted
trying
to
create
so
dense
a
prison
that
further
movement
would
be
impossible
as
far
as
maskull
could
detect
most
of
the
sparks
succeeded
eventually
in
finding
their
way
out
after
frantic
efforts
but
one
that
he
was
looking
at
was
caught
and
what
happened
was
this
a
complete
ring
of
cloud
surrounded
it
and
in
spite
of
its
furious
leaps
and
flashes
in
all
if
it
were
a
live
savage
creature
caught
in
a
could
it
find
an
opening
but
it
dragged
the
enveloping
cloud
stuff
with
it
wherever
it
went
the
vapours
continued
to
thicken
around
it
until
they
resembled
the
black
heavy
compressed
sky
masses
seen
before
a
bad
thunderstorm
then
the
green
spark
which
was
still
visible
in
the
interior
ceased
its
efforts
and
remained
for
a
time
quite
quiescent
the
cloud
shape
went
on
consolidating
itself
and
became
nearly
spherical
as
it
grew
heavier
and
stiller
it
started
slowly
to
descend
toward
the
valley
floor
when
it
was
directly
opposite
maskull
with
its
lower
end
only
a
few
feet
off
the
ground
its
motion
stopped
altogether
and
there
was
a
complete
pause
for
at
least
two
minutes
suddenly
like
a
stab
of
forked
lightning
the
great
cloud
shot
together
became
small
indented
and
coloured
and
as
a
started
walking
around
on
legs
and
rooting
up
the
ground
in
search
of
food
the
concluding
stage
of
the
phenomenon
he
witnessed
with
his
normal
eyesight
it
showed
him
the
creature
s
appearing
miraculously
out
of
nowhere
maskull
was
shaken
his
cynicism
dropped
from
him
and
gave
place
to
curiosity
and
awe
that
was
exactly
like
the
birth
of
a
thought
he
said
to
himself
but
who
was
the
thinker
some
great
living
mind
is
at
work
in
this
spot
he
has
intelligence
for
all
his
shapes
are
different
and
he
has
character
for
all
belong
to
the
same
general
type
if
i
m
not
wrong
and
if
it
s
the
force
called
shaping
or
crystalman
i
ve
seen
enough
to
make
me
want
to
find
out
something
more
about
him
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
go
on
to
other
riddles
before
i
have
solved
a
voice
called
out
to
him
from
behind
and
turning
around
he
saw
a
human
figure
hastening
toward
him
from
some
distance
down
the
ravine
it
looked
more
like
a
man
than
a
woman
he
was
rather
tall
but
nimble
and
was
clothed
in
a
dark
frocklike
garment
that
reached
from
the
neck
to
below
the
knees
around
his
head
was
rolled
a
turban
maskull
waited
for
him
and
when
he
was
nearer
went
a
little
way
to
meet
him
then
he
experienced
another
surprise
for
this
person
although
clearly
a
human
being
was
neither
man
nor
woman
nor
anything
between
the
two
but
was
unmistakably
of
a
third
positive
sex
which
was
remarkable
to
behold
and
difficult
to
understand
in
order
to
translate
into
words
the
sexual
impression
produced
in
maskull
s
mind
by
the
stranger
s
physical
aspect
it
is
necessary
to
coin
a
new
pronoun
for
none
in
earthly
use
would
be
applicable
instead
of
he
she
or
it
therefore
ae
will
be
used
he
found
himself
incapable
of
grasping
at
first
why
the
bodily
peculiarities
of
this
being
should
strike
him
as
springing
from
sex
and
not
from
race
and
yet
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
itself
body
face
and
eyes
were
absolutely
neither
male
nor
female
but
something
quite
different
just
as
one
can
distinguish
a
man
from
a
woman
at
the
first
glance
by
some
indefinable
difference
of
expression
and
atmospheres
altogether
apart
from
the
contour
of
the
figure
so
the
stranger
was
separated
in
appearance
from
both
as
with
men
and
women
the
whole
person
expressed
a
latent
sensuality
which
gave
body
and
face
alike
their
peculiar
character
maskull
decided
that
it
was
what
for
whom
it
was
neither
the
passion
of
a
male
nor
the
instinct
of
a
female
to
obey
her
destiny
it
was
as
real
and
irresistible
as
these
but
quite
different
as
he
continued
staring
into
those
strange
archaic
eyes
he
had
an
intuitive
feeling
that
aer
lover
was
no
other
than
shaping
himself
it
came
to
him
that
the
design
of
this
love
was
not
the
continuance
of
the
race
but
the
immortality
on
earth
of
the
individual
no
children
were
produced
by
the
act
the
lover
aerself
was
the
eternal
child
further
ae
sought
like
a
man
but
received
like
a
woman
all
these
things
were
dimly
and
confusedly
expressed
by
this
extraordinary
being
who
seemed
to
have
dropped
out
of
another
age
when
creation
was
different
of
all
the
weird
personalities
maskull
had
so
far
met
in
tormance
this
one
struck
him
as
infinitely
the
most
is
the
farthest
removed
from
him
in
spiritual
structure
if
they
were
to
live
together
for
a
hundred
years
they
could
never
be
companions
maskull
pulled
himself
out
of
his
trancelike
meditations
and
viewing
the
newcomer
in
greater
detail
tried
with
his
understanding
to
account
for
the
marvellous
things
told
him
by
his
intuitions
ae
possessed
broad
shoulders
and
big
bones
and
was
without
female
breasts
and
so
far
ae
resembled
a
man
but
the
bones
were
so
flat
and
angular
that
aer
flesh
presented
something
of
the
character
of
a
crystal
having
plane
surfaces
in
place
of
curves
the
body
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
ground
down
by
the
sea
of
ages
into
smooth
and
rounded
regularity
but
had
sprung
together
in
angles
and
facets
as
the
result
of
a
single
sudden
idea
the
face
too
was
broken
and
irregular
with
his
racial
prejudices
maskull
found
little
beauty
in
it
yet
beauty
there
was
though
neither
of
a
masculine
nor
of
a
feminine
type
for
it
had
the
three
essentials
of
beauty
character
intelligence
and
repose
the
skin
was
coloured
and
strangely
luminous
as
if
lighted
from
within
the
face
was
beardless
but
the
hair
of
the
head
was
as
long
as
a
woman
s
and
dressed
in
a
single
plait
fell
down
behind
as
far
as
the
ankles
ae
possessed
only
two
eyes
that
part
of
the
turban
which
went
across
the
forehead
protruded
so
far
in
front
that
it
evidently
concealed
some
organ
maskull
found
it
impossible
to
compute
aer
age
the
frame
appeared
active
vigorous
and
healthy
the
skin
was
clear
and
glowing
the
eyes
were
powerful
and
might
well
be
in
early
youth
nevertheless
the
longer
maskull
gazed
the
more
an
impression
of
unbelievable
ancientness
came
upon
real
youth
seemed
as
far
away
as
the
view
observed
through
a
reversed
telescope
at
last
he
addressed
the
stranger
though
it
was
just
as
if
he
were
conversing
with
a
dream
to
what
sex
do
you
belong
he
asked
the
voice
in
which
the
reply
came
was
neither
manly
nor
womanly
but
was
oddly
suggestive
of
a
mystical
forest
horn
heard
from
a
great
distance
nowadays
there
are
men
and
women
but
in
the
olden
times
the
world
was
peopled
by
i
think
i
am
the
only
survivor
of
all
those
beings
who
were
then
passing
through
faceny
s
faceny
who
is
now
miscalled
shaping
or
crystalman
the
superficial
names
invented
by
a
race
of
superficial
what
s
your
own
name
what
leehallfae
and
yours
is
maskull
i
read
in
your
mind
that
you
have
just
come
through
some
wonderful
adventures
you
seem
to
possess
extraordinary
luck
if
it
lasts
long
enough
perhaps
i
can
make
use
of
do
you
think
that
my
luck
exists
for
your
benefit
but
never
mind
that
now
it
is
your
that
interests
me
how
do
you
satisfy
your
desires
leehallfae
pointed
to
the
concealed
organ
on
her
brow
with
that
i
gather
life
from
the
streams
that
flow
in
all
the
hundred
matterplay
valleys
the
streams
spring
direct
from
faceny
my
whole
life
has
been
spent
trying
to
find
faceny
himself
i
ve
hunted
so
long
that
if
i
were
to
state
the
number
of
years
you
would
believe
i
maskull
looked
at
the
phaen
slowly
in
ifdawn
i
met
someone
else
from
young
man
called
digrung
i
absorbed
you
can
t
be
telling
me
this
out
of
it
was
a
fearful
crime
what
will
come
of
it
leehallfae
gave
a
curious
wrinkled
smile
in
matterplay
he
will
stir
inside
you
for
he
smells
the
air
already
you
have
his
eyes
i
knew
him
take
care
of
yourself
or
something
more
startling
may
happen
keep
out
of
the
this
seems
to
me
a
terrible
valley
in
which
anything
may
don
t
torment
yourself
about
digrung
the
valleys
belong
by
right
to
the
men
here
are
interlopers
it
is
a
good
work
to
remove
maskull
continued
thoughtful
i
say
no
more
but
i
see
i
will
have
to
be
cautious
what
did
you
mean
about
my
helping
you
with
my
luck
your
luck
is
fast
weakening
but
it
may
still
be
strong
enough
to
serve
me
together
we
will
search
for
search
for
is
it
so
hard
to
find
i
have
told
you
that
my
whole
life
has
been
spent
in
the
you
said
faceny
the
phaen
gazed
at
him
with
queer
ancient
eyes
and
smiled
again
this
stream
maskull
like
every
other
life
stream
in
matterplay
has
its
source
in
faceny
but
as
all
these
streams
issue
out
from
threal
it
is
in
threal
that
we
must
look
for
but
what
s
to
prevent
your
finding
threal
surely
it
s
a
country
it
lies
underground
its
communications
with
the
upper
world
are
few
and
where
they
are
no
one
that
i
have
ever
spoken
to
knows
i
have
scoured
the
valleys
and
the
hills
i
have
been
to
the
very
gates
of
lichstorm
i
am
old
so
that
your
aged
men
would
appear
newborn
infants
beside
me
but
i
am
as
far
from
threal
as
when
i
was
a
green
youth
dwelling
among
a
throng
of
fellow
then
if
my
luck
is
good
yours
is
very
bad
but
when
you
have
found
faceny
what
do
you
gain
leehallfae
looked
at
him
in
silence
the
smile
faded
from
aer
face
and
its
place
was
taken
by
such
a
look
of
unearthly
pain
and
sorrow
that
maskull
had
no
need
to
press
his
question
ae
was
consumed
by
the
grief
and
yearning
of
a
lover
eternally
separated
from
the
loved
one
the
scents
and
traces
of
whose
person
were
always
present
this
passion
stamped
aer
features
at
that
moment
with
a
wild
stern
spiritual
beauty
far
transcending
any
beauty
of
woman
or
man
but
the
expression
vanished
suddenly
and
then
the
abrupt
contrast
showed
maskull
the
real
leehallfae
aer
sensuality
was
solitary
but
was
like
the
heroism
of
a
lonely
nature
pursuing
animal
aims
with
untiring
persistence
he
looked
at
the
phaen
askance
and
drummed
his
fingers
against
his
thigh
well
we
will
go
together
we
may
find
something
and
in
any
case
i
shan
t
be
sorry
to
converse
with
such
a
singular
individual
as
but
i
should
warn
you
maskull
you
and
i
are
of
different
creations
a
phaen
s
body
contains
the
whole
of
life
a
man
s
body
contains
only
the
half
of
other
half
is
in
woman
faceny
may
be
too
strong
a
draught
for
your
body
to
endure
do
you
not
feel
this
i
am
dull
with
my
different
feelings
i
must
take
what
precautions
i
can
and
chance
the
he
bent
down
and
taking
hold
of
the
phaen
s
thin
and
ragged
robe
tore
off
a
broad
strip
which
he
proceeded
to
swathe
in
folds
around
his
forehead
i
m
not
forgetting
your
advice
leehallfae
i
would
not
like
to
start
the
walk
as
maskull
and
finish
it
as
the
phaen
gave
a
twisted
grin
and
they
began
to
move
upstream
the
road
was
difficult
they
had
to
stride
from
boulder
to
boulder
and
found
it
warm
work
occasionally
a
worse
obstacle
presented
itself
which
they
could
surmount
only
by
climbing
there
was
no
more
conversation
for
a
long
time
maskull
as
far
as
possible
adopted
his
companion
s
counsel
to
avoid
the
water
but
here
and
there
he
was
forced
to
set
foot
in
it
the
second
or
third
time
he
did
so
he
felt
a
sudden
agony
in
his
arm
where
it
had
been
wounded
by
krag
his
eyes
grew
joyful
his
fears
vanished
and
he
began
deliberately
to
tread
the
stream
leehallfae
stroked
aer
chin
and
watched
him
with
eyes
trying
to
comprehend
what
had
happened
is
your
luck
speaking
to
you
maskull
or
what
is
the
matter
listen
you
are
a
being
of
antique
experience
and
ought
to
know
if
anyone
does
what
is
muspel
the
phaen
s
face
was
blank
i
don
t
know
the
it
is
another
world
of
some
that
can
not
be
there
is
only
this
one
maskull
came
up
to
aer
linked
arms
and
began
to
talk
i
m
glad
i
fell
in
with
you
leehallfae
for
this
valley
and
everything
connected
with
it
need
a
lot
of
explaining
for
example
in
this
spot
there
are
hardly
any
organic
forms
have
they
all
disappeared
you
call
this
brook
a
life
stream
yet
the
nearer
its
source
we
get
the
less
life
it
produces
a
mile
or
two
lower
down
we
had
those
spontaneous
animals
appearing
out
of
nowhere
while
right
down
by
the
sea
plants
and
animals
were
tumbling
over
one
another
now
if
all
this
is
connected
in
some
mysterious
way
or
other
with
your
faceny
it
seems
to
me
he
must
have
a
most
paradoxical
nature
his
essence
doesn
t
start
creating
shapes
until
it
has
become
thoroughly
weakened
and
watered
but
perhaps
both
of
us
are
talking
leehallfae
shook
aer
head
everything
hangs
together
the
stream
is
life
and
it
is
throwing
off
sparks
of
life
all
the
time
when
these
sparks
are
caught
and
imprisoned
by
matter
they
become
living
shapes
the
nearer
the
stream
is
to
its
source
the
more
terrible
and
vigorous
is
its
life
you
ll
see
for
yourself
when
we
reach
the
head
of
the
valley
that
there
are
no
living
shapes
there
at
all
that
means
that
there
is
no
kind
of
matter
tough
enough
to
capture
and
hold
the
terrible
sparks
that
are
to
be
found
there
lower
down
the
stream
most
of
the
sparks
are
vigorous
enough
to
escape
to
the
upper
air
but
some
are
held
when
they
are
a
little
way
up
and
these
burst
suddenly
into
shapes
i
myself
am
of
this
nature
lower
down
still
toward
the
sea
the
stream
has
lost
a
great
part
of
its
vital
power
and
the
sparks
are
lazy
and
sluggish
they
spread
out
rather
than
rise
into
the
air
there
is
hardly
any
kind
of
matter
however
delicate
that
is
incapable
of
capturing
these
feeble
sparks
and
they
are
captured
in
accounts
for
the
innumerable
living
shapes
you
see
there
but
not
only
sparks
are
passed
from
one
body
to
another
by
way
of
generation
and
can
never
hope
to
cease
being
so
until
they
are
worn
out
by
decay
lowest
of
all
you
have
the
sinking
sea
itself
there
the
degenerate
and
enfeebled
life
of
the
matterplay
streams
has
for
its
body
the
whole
sea
so
weak
is
it
s
power
that
it
can
t
succeed
in
creating
any
shapes
at
all
but
you
can
see
its
ceaseless
futile
attempts
to
do
so
in
those
so
the
slow
development
of
men
and
women
is
due
to
the
feebleness
of
the
life
germ
in
their
case
exactly
it
can
t
attain
all
its
desires
at
once
and
now
you
can
see
how
immeasurably
superior
are
the
phaens
who
spring
spontaneously
from
the
more
electric
and
vigorous
but
where
does
the
matter
come
from
that
imprisons
these
sparks
when
life
dies
it
becomes
matter
matter
itself
dies
but
its
place
is
constantly
taken
by
new
but
if
life
comes
from
faceny
how
can
it
die
at
all
life
is
the
thoughts
of
faceny
and
once
these
thoughts
have
left
his
brain
they
are
dying
this
is
a
cheerless
philosophy
said
maskull
but
who
is
faceny
himself
then
and
why
does
he
think
at
all
leehallfae
gave
another
wrinkled
smile
that
i
ll
explain
too
faceny
is
of
this
nature
he
faces
nothingness
in
all
directions
he
has
no
back
and
no
sides
but
is
all
face
and
this
face
is
his
shape
it
must
necessarily
be
so
for
nothing
else
can
exist
between
him
and
nothingness
his
face
is
all
eyes
for
he
eternally
contemplates
nothingness
he
draws
his
inspirations
from
it
in
no
other
way
could
he
feel
himself
for
the
same
reason
phaens
and
even
men
love
to
be
in
empty
places
and
vast
solitudes
for
each
one
is
a
little
that
rings
true
said
maskull
thoughts
flow
perpetually
from
faceny
s
face
backward
since
his
face
is
on
all
sides
however
they
flow
into
his
interior
a
draught
of
thought
thus
continuously
flows
from
nothingness
to
the
inside
of
faceny
which
is
the
world
the
thoughts
become
shapes
and
people
the
world
this
outer
world
therefore
which
is
lying
all
around
us
is
not
outside
at
all
as
it
happens
but
inside
the
visible
universe
is
like
a
gigantic
stomach
and
the
real
outside
of
the
world
we
shall
never
maskull
pondered
deeply
for
a
while
leehallfae
i
fail
to
see
what
you
personally
have
to
hope
for
since
you
are
nothing
more
than
a
discarded
dying
have
you
never
loved
a
woman
asked
the
phaen
regarding
him
fixedly
perhaps
i
when
you
loved
did
you
have
no
high
moments
that
s
asking
the
same
question
in
other
in
those
moments
you
were
approaching
faceny
if
you
could
have
drawn
nearer
still
would
you
not
have
done
so
i
would
regardless
of
the
even
if
you
personally
had
nothing
to
hope
for
but
i
would
have
that
to
hope
leehallfae
walked
on
in
silence
a
man
is
the
half
of
life
ae
broke
out
suddenly
a
woman
is
the
other
half
of
life
but
a
phaen
is
the
whole
of
life
moreover
when
life
becomes
split
into
halves
something
else
has
dropped
out
of
that
belongs
only
to
the
whole
between
your
love
and
mine
there
is
no
comparison
if
even
your
sluggish
blood
is
drawn
to
faceny
without
stopping
to
ask
what
will
come
of
it
how
do
you
suppose
it
is
with
me
i
don
t
question
the
genuineness
of
your
passion
replied
maskull
but
it
s
a
pity
you
can
t
see
your
way
to
carry
it
forward
into
the
next
leehallfae
gave
a
distorted
grin
expressing
heaven
knows
what
emotion
men
think
what
they
like
but
phaens
are
so
made
that
they
can
see
the
world
only
as
it
really
that
ended
the
conversation
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
and
they
appeared
to
be
approaching
the
head
of
the
ravine
its
walls
had
still
further
closed
in
and
except
at
those
moments
when
branchspell
was
directly
behind
them
they
strode
along
all
the
time
in
deep
shade
but
still
it
was
disagreeably
hot
and
relaxing
all
life
had
ceased
a
beautiful
fantastic
spectacle
was
presented
by
the
cliff
faces
the
rocky
ground
and
the
boulders
that
choked
the
entire
width
of
the
gorge
they
were
of
a
crystalline
limestone
heavily
scored
by
veins
of
bright
gleaming
blue
the
rivulet
was
no
longer
green
but
a
clear
transparent
crystal
its
noise
was
musical
and
altogether
it
looked
most
romantic
and
charming
but
leehallfae
seemed
to
find
something
else
in
features
grew
more
and
more
set
and
tortured
about
half
an
hour
after
all
the
other
life
forms
had
vanished
another
was
precipitated
out
of
space
in
front
of
their
eyes
it
was
as
tall
as
maskull
himself
and
had
a
brilliant
and
vigorous
appearance
as
befitted
a
creature
just
out
of
nature
s
mint
it
started
to
walk
about
but
hardly
had
it
done
so
when
it
burst
silently
asunder
nothing
remained
of
whole
body
disappeared
instantaneously
into
the
same
invisible
mist
from
which
it
had
sprung
that
bears
out
what
you
said
commented
maskull
turning
rather
pale
yes
answered
leehallfae
we
have
now
come
to
the
region
of
terrible
then
since
you
re
right
in
this
i
must
believe
all
that
you
ve
been
telling
as
he
uttered
the
words
they
were
just
turning
a
bend
of
the
ravine
there
now
loomed
up
straight
ahead
a
perpendicular
cliff
about
three
hundred
feet
in
height
composed
of
white
marbled
rock
it
was
the
head
of
the
valley
and
beyond
it
they
could
not
proceed
in
return
for
my
wisdom
said
the
phaen
you
will
now
lend
me
your
they
walked
up
to
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
maskull
looked
at
it
reflectively
it
was
possible
to
climb
it
but
the
ascent
would
be
difficult
the
now
tiny
brook
issued
from
a
hole
in
the
rock
only
a
few
feet
up
apart
from
its
musical
running
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
the
floor
of
the
gorge
was
in
shadow
but
about
halfway
up
the
precipice
the
sun
was
shining
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
demanded
maskull
everything
is
now
in
your
hands
and
i
have
no
suggestions
to
make
now
it
s
your
luck
that
must
help
maskull
continued
gazing
up
a
little
while
longer
we
had
better
wait
till
the
afternoon
leehallfae
i
ll
probably
have
to
climb
to
the
top
but
it
s
too
hot
at
besides
i
m
tired
i
ll
snatch
a
few
hours
sleep
after
that
we
ll
leehallfae
seemed
annoyed
but
raised
no
opposition
chapter
corpang
maskull
did
not
awaken
till
long
after
blodsombre
leehallfae
was
standing
by
his
side
looking
down
at
him
it
was
doubtful
whether
ae
had
slept
at
all
what
time
is
it
maskull
asked
rubbing
his
eyes
and
sitting
up
the
day
is
passing
was
the
vague
reply
maskull
got
on
to
his
feet
and
gazed
up
at
the
cliff
now
i
m
going
to
climb
that
no
need
for
both
of
us
to
risk
our
necks
so
you
wait
here
and
if
i
find
anything
on
top
i
ll
call
a
phaen
glanced
at
him
strangely
there
s
nothing
up
there
except
a
bare
hillside
i
ve
been
there
often
have
you
anything
special
in
mind
heights
often
bring
me
inspiration
sit
down
and
refreshed
by
his
sleep
maskull
immediately
attacked
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
took
the
first
twenty
feet
at
a
single
rush
then
it
grew
precipitous
and
the
ascent
demanded
greater
circumspection
and
intelligence
there
were
few
or
footholds
he
had
to
reflect
before
every
step
on
the
other
hand
it
was
sound
rock
and
he
was
no
novice
at
the
sport
branchspell
glared
full
on
the
wall
so
that
it
half
blinded
him
with
its
glittering
whiteness
after
many
doubts
and
pauses
he
drew
near
the
top
he
was
hot
sweating
copiously
and
rather
dizzy
to
reach
a
ledge
he
caught
hold
of
two
projecting
rocks
one
with
each
hand
at
the
same
time
scrambling
upward
his
legs
between
the
rocks
the
rock
which
was
the
larger
of
the
two
became
dislodged
by
his
weight
and
flying
like
a
huge
dark
shadow
past
his
head
crashed
down
with
a
terrifying
sound
to
the
foot
of
the
precipice
followed
by
an
avalanche
of
smaller
stones
maskull
steadied
himself
as
well
as
he
could
but
it
was
some
moments
before
he
dared
to
look
down
behind
him
at
first
he
could
not
distinguish
leehallfae
then
he
caught
sight
of
legs
and
hindquarters
a
few
feet
up
the
cliff
from
the
bottom
he
perceived
that
the
phaen
had
aer
head
in
a
cavity
and
was
scrutinising
something
and
waited
for
aer
to
reappear
ae
emerged
looked
up
to
maskull
and
called
out
in
aer
hornlike
voice
the
entrance
is
here
i
m
coming
down
roared
maskull
wait
for
me
he
descended
taking
too
much
care
for
he
thought
he
recognised
his
luck
in
this
within
twenty
minutes
was
standing
beside
the
phaen
what
happened
the
rock
you
dislodged
struck
this
other
rock
just
above
the
spring
it
tore
it
out
of
its
bed
there
s
room
for
us
to
get
in
don
t
get
excited
said
maskull
it
s
a
remarkable
accident
but
we
have
plenty
of
time
let
me
he
peered
into
the
hole
which
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
big
man
without
stooping
contrasted
with
the
daylight
outside
it
was
dark
yet
a
peculiar
glow
pervaded
the
place
and
he
could
see
well
enough
a
rock
tunnel
went
straight
forward
into
the
bowels
of
the
hill
out
of
sight
the
valley
brook
did
not
flow
along
the
floor
of
this
tunnel
as
he
had
expected
but
came
up
as
a
spring
just
inside
the
entrance
well
leehallfae
not
much
need
to
deliberate
eh
still
observe
that
your
stream
parts
company
with
us
as
he
turned
around
for
an
answer
he
noticed
that
his
companion
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
why
what
s
the
matter
leehallfae
pressed
a
hand
to
aer
heart
the
stream
leaves
us
but
what
makes
the
stream
what
it
is
continues
with
us
faceny
is
but
surely
you
don
t
expect
to
see
him
in
person
why
are
you
shaking
perhaps
it
will
be
too
much
for
me
after
why
how
is
it
affecting
you
the
phaen
took
him
by
the
shoulder
and
held
him
at
arm
s
length
endeavouring
to
study
him
with
aer
unsteady
eyes
faceny
s
thoughts
are
obscure
i
am
his
lover
you
are
a
lover
of
women
yet
he
grants
to
you
what
he
denies
to
what
does
he
grant
to
me
to
see
him
and
go
on
living
i
shall
die
but
it
s
immaterial
tomorrow
both
of
us
will
be
maskull
impatiently
shook
himself
free
your
sensations
may
be
reliable
in
your
own
case
but
how
do
you
know
i
shall
die
life
is
flaming
up
inside
you
replied
leehallfae
shaking
aer
head
but
after
it
has
reached
its
will
sink
rapidly
and
you
ll
die
tomorrow
as
for
me
if
i
enter
threal
i
shan
t
come
out
again
a
smell
of
death
is
being
wafted
to
me
out
of
this
you
talk
like
a
frightened
man
i
smell
i
am
not
frightened
said
leehallfae
had
been
gradually
recovering
aer
but
when
one
has
lived
as
long
as
i
have
it
is
a
serious
matter
to
die
every
year
one
puts
out
new
decide
what
you
re
going
to
do
said
maskull
with
a
touch
of
contempt
for
i
m
going
in
at
the
phaen
gave
an
odd
meditative
stare
down
the
ravine
and
after
that
walked
into
the
cavern
without
another
word
maskull
scratching
his
head
followed
close
at
aer
heels
the
moment
they
stepped
across
the
bubbling
spring
the
atmosphere
altered
without
becoming
stale
or
unpleasant
it
grew
cold
clear
and
refined
and
somehow
suggested
austere
and
tomblike
thoughts
the
daylight
disappeared
at
the
first
bend
in
the
tunnel
after
that
maskull
could
not
say
where
the
light
came
from
the
air
itself
must
have
been
luminous
for
though
it
was
as
light
as
full
moon
on
earth
neither
he
nor
leehallfae
cast
a
shadow
another
peculiarity
of
the
light
was
that
both
the
walls
of
the
tunnel
and
their
own
bodies
appeared
colourless
everything
was
black
and
white
like
a
lunar
landscape
this
intensified
the
solemn
funereal
feelings
created
by
the
atmosphere
after
they
had
proceeded
for
about
ten
minutes
the
tunnel
began
to
widen
out
the
roof
was
high
above
their
heads
and
six
men
could
have
walked
side
by
side
leehallfae
was
visibly
weakening
ae
dragged
aerself
along
slowly
and
painfully
with
sunken
head
maskull
caught
hold
of
aer
you
can
t
go
on
like
that
better
let
me
take
you
the
phaen
smiled
and
staggered
i
m
don
t
talk
like
that
it
s
only
a
passing
indisposition
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
no
help
me
forward
i
wish
to
see
the
sick
must
have
their
way
said
maskull
lifting
aer
bodily
in
his
arms
he
walked
quickly
along
for
another
hundred
yards
or
so
they
then
emerged
from
the
tunnel
and
faced
a
world
the
parallel
of
which
he
had
never
set
eyes
upon
before
set
me
down
directed
leehallfae
feebly
here
i
ll
maskull
obeyed
and
laid
aer
down
at
full
length
on
the
rocky
ground
the
phaen
raised
aerself
with
difficulty
on
one
arm
and
stared
with
eyes
at
the
mystic
landscape
maskull
looked
too
and
what
he
saw
was
a
vast
undulating
plain
lighted
as
if
by
the
there
was
of
course
no
moon
and
there
were
no
shadows
he
made
out
running
streams
in
the
distance
beside
them
were
trees
of
a
peculiar
kind
they
were
rooted
in
the
ground
but
the
branches
also
were
aerial
roots
and
there
were
no
leaves
no
other
plants
could
be
seen
the
soil
was
soft
porous
rock
resembling
pumice
beyond
a
mile
or
two
in
any
direction
the
light
merged
into
obscurity
at
their
back
a
great
rocky
wall
extended
on
either
hand
but
it
was
not
square
like
a
wall
but
full
of
bays
and
promontories
like
an
indented
line
of
sea
cliffs
the
roof
of
this
huge
underworld
was
out
of
sight
here
and
there
a
mighty
shaft
of
naked
rock
fantastically
weathered
towered
aloft
into
the
gloom
doubtless
serving
to
support
the
roof
there
were
no
detail
of
the
landscape
was
black
white
or
grey
the
scene
appeared
so
still
so
solemn
and
religious
that
all
his
feelings
quieted
down
to
absolute
tranquillity
leehallfae
fell
back
suddenly
maskull
dropped
on
his
knees
and
helplessly
watched
the
last
flickerings
of
aer
spirit
going
out
like
a
candle
in
foul
air
death
came
he
closed
the
eyes
the
awful
grin
of
crystalman
immediately
fastened
upon
the
phaen
s
dead
features
while
maskull
was
still
kneeling
he
became
conscious
of
someone
standing
beside
him
he
looked
up
quickly
and
saw
a
man
but
did
not
at
once
rise
another
phaen
dead
said
the
newcomer
in
a
grave
toneless
and
intellectual
voice
maskull
got
up
the
man
was
short
and
thickset
but
emaciated
his
forehead
was
not
disfigured
by
any
organs
he
was
the
features
were
energetic
and
rather
it
seemed
to
maskull
as
though
a
pure
hard
life
had
done
something
toward
refining
them
his
sanguine
eyes
carried
a
twisted
puzzled
look
some
unanswerable
problem
was
apparently
in
the
forefront
of
his
brain
his
face
was
hairless
the
hair
of
his
head
was
short
and
manly
his
brow
was
wide
he
was
clothed
in
a
black
sleeveless
robe
and
bore
a
long
staff
in
his
hand
there
was
an
air
of
cleanness
and
austerity
about
the
whole
man
that
was
attractive
he
went
on
speaking
dispassionately
to
maskull
and
while
doing
so
kept
passing
his
hand
reflectively
over
his
cheeks
and
chin
they
all
find
their
way
here
to
die
they
come
from
matterplay
there
they
live
to
an
incredible
age
partly
on
that
account
and
partly
because
of
their
spontaneous
origin
they
regard
themselves
as
the
favoured
children
of
faceny
but
when
they
come
here
to
find
him
they
die
at
i
think
this
one
is
the
last
of
the
race
but
whom
do
i
speak
to
i
am
corpang
who
are
you
where
do
you
come
from
and
what
are
you
doing
here
my
name
is
maskull
my
home
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
universe
as
for
what
i
am
doing
accompanied
leehallfae
that
phaen
from
but
a
man
doesn
t
accompany
a
phaen
out
of
friendship
what
do
you
want
in
threal
then
this
is
threal
maskull
remained
silent
corpang
studied
his
face
with
rough
curious
eyes
are
you
ignorant
or
merely
reticent
maskull
i
came
here
to
ask
questions
and
not
to
answer
the
stillness
of
the
place
was
almost
oppressive
not
a
breeze
stirred
and
not
a
sound
came
through
the
air
their
voices
had
been
lowered
as
though
they
were
in
a
cathedral
then
do
you
want
my
society
or
not
asked
corpang
yes
if
you
can
fit
in
with
my
mood
which
to
talk
about
but
you
must
at
least
tell
me
where
you
want
to
go
i
want
to
see
what
is
to
be
seen
here
and
then
go
on
to
i
can
guide
you
through
if
that
s
all
you
want
come
let
us
first
let
s
do
our
duty
and
bury
the
dead
if
turn
around
directed
corpang
maskull
looked
around
quickly
leehallfae
s
body
had
disappeared
what
does
this
has
happened
the
body
has
returned
to
whence
it
came
there
was
nowhere
here
for
it
to
be
so
it
has
vanished
no
burial
will
be
was
the
phaen
an
illusion
then
in
no
well
explain
quickly
then
what
has
taken
place
i
seem
to
be
going
there
s
nothing
unintelligible
in
it
if
you
ll
only
listen
calmly
the
phaen
belonged
body
and
soul
to
the
outside
visible
faceny
this
underworld
is
not
faceny
s
world
but
thire
s
and
faceny
s
creatures
can
not
breathe
its
atmosphere
as
this
applies
not
only
to
whole
bodies
but
even
to
the
last
particles
of
bodies
the
phaen
has
dissolved
into
but
don
t
you
and
i
belong
to
the
outside
world
too
we
belong
to
all
three
what
three
do
you
mean
there
are
three
worlds
said
corpang
composedly
the
first
is
faceny
s
the
second
is
amfuse
s
the
third
is
thire
s
from
him
threal
gets
its
but
this
is
mere
nomenclature
in
what
sense
are
there
three
worlds
corpang
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
all
this
we
can
discuss
as
we
go
along
it
s
a
torment
to
me
to
be
standing
maskull
stared
again
at
the
spot
where
leehallfae
s
body
had
lain
quite
bewildered
at
the
extraordinary
disappearance
he
could
scarcely
tear
himself
away
from
the
place
so
mysterious
was
it
not
until
corpang
called
to
him
a
second
time
did
he
make
up
his
mind
to
follow
him
they
set
off
from
the
rock
wall
straight
across
the
airlit
plain
directing
their
course
toward
the
nearest
trees
the
subdued
light
the
absence
of
shadows
the
massive
shafts
springing
out
of
the
jetlike
ground
the
fantastic
trees
the
absence
of
a
sky
the
deathly
silence
the
knowledge
that
he
was
combination
of
all
these
things
predisposed
maskull
s
mind
to
mysticism
and
he
prepared
himself
with
some
anxiety
to
hear
corpang
s
explanation
of
the
land
and
its
wonders
he
already
began
to
grasp
that
the
reality
of
the
outside
world
and
the
reality
of
this
world
were
two
quite
different
things
in
what
sense
are
there
three
worlds
he
demanded
repeating
his
former
question
corpang
smote
the
end
of
his
staff
on
the
ground
first
of
all
maskull
what
is
your
motive
for
asking
if
it
s
mere
intellectual
curiosity
tell
me
for
we
mustn
t
play
with
awful
no
it
isn
t
that
said
maskull
slowly
i
m
not
a
student
my
journey
is
no
holiday
isn
t
there
blood
on
your
soul
asked
corpang
eying
him
intently
the
blood
rose
steadily
to
maskull
s
face
but
in
that
light
it
caused
it
to
appear
black
unfortunately
there
is
and
not
a
the
other
s
face
was
all
wrinkles
but
he
made
no
comment
and
so
you
see
went
on
maskull
with
a
short
laugh
i
m
in
the
very
best
condition
for
receiving
your
corpang
still
paused
underneath
your
crimes
i
see
a
man
he
said
after
a
few
minutes
on
that
account
and
because
we
are
commanded
to
help
one
another
i
won
t
leave
you
at
present
though
i
little
thought
to
be
walking
with
a
murderer
now
to
your
question
whatever
a
man
sees
with
his
eyes
maskull
he
sees
in
three
breadth
depth
length
is
existence
breadth
is
relation
depth
is
something
of
the
sort
was
told
me
by
earthrid
the
musician
who
came
from
i
don
t
know
him
what
else
did
he
tell
you
he
went
on
to
apply
it
to
music
continue
and
pardon
the
these
three
states
of
perception
are
the
three
worlds
existence
is
faceny
s
world
relation
is
amfuse
s
world
feeling
is
thire
s
can
t
we
come
down
to
hard
facts
said
maskull
frowning
i
understand
no
more
than
i
did
before
what
you
mean
by
three
there
are
no
harder
facts
than
the
ones
i
am
giving
you
the
first
world
is
visible
tangible
nature
it
was
created
by
faceny
out
of
nothingness
and
therefore
we
call
it
that
i
the
second
world
is
which
i
don
t
mean
lust
without
love
every
individual
would
be
entirely
and
unable
deliberately
to
act
on
others
without
love
there
would
be
no
even
hatred
anger
or
revenge
would
be
possible
these
are
all
imperfect
and
distorted
forms
of
pure
love
interpenetrating
faceny
s
world
of
nature
therefore
we
have
amfuse
s
world
of
love
or
what
grounds
have
you
for
assuming
that
this
second
world
is
not
contained
in
the
first
they
are
contradictory
a
natural
man
lives
for
himself
a
lover
lives
for
it
may
be
so
it
s
rather
mystical
but
go
is
thire
length
and
breadth
together
without
depth
give
flatness
life
and
love
without
feeling
produce
shallow
superficial
natures
feeling
is
the
need
of
men
to
stretch
out
toward
their
you
mean
prayer
and
worship
i
mean
intimacy
with
thire
this
feeling
is
not
to
be
found
in
either
the
first
or
second
world
therefore
it
is
a
third
world
just
as
depth
is
the
line
between
object
and
subject
feeling
is
the
line
between
thire
and
but
what
is
thire
himself
thire
is
the
i
still
don
t
understand
said
maskull
do
you
believe
in
three
separate
gods
or
are
these
merely
three
ways
of
regarding
one
god
there
are
three
gods
for
they
are
mutually
antagonistic
yet
they
are
somehow
maskull
reflected
a
while
how
have
you
arrived
at
these
conclusions
none
other
are
possible
in
threal
why
in
is
there
peculiar
here
i
will
show
you
they
walked
on
for
above
a
mile
in
silence
while
maskull
digested
what
had
been
said
when
they
came
to
the
first
trees
which
grew
along
the
banks
of
a
small
stream
of
transparent
water
corpang
halted
that
bandage
around
your
forehead
has
long
been
unnecessary
he
remarked
maskull
removed
it
he
found
that
the
line
of
his
brow
was
smooth
and
uninterrupted
as
it
had
never
yet
been
since
his
arrival
in
tormance
how
has
this
come
how
did
you
know
it
they
were
faceny
s
organs
they
have
vanished
just
as
the
phaen
s
body
maskull
kept
rubbing
his
forehead
i
feel
more
human
without
them
but
why
isn
t
the
rest
of
my
body
affected
because
its
living
will
contains
the
element
of
why
are
we
stopping
here
corpang
broke
off
the
tip
of
one
of
the
aerial
roots
of
a
tree
and
proffered
it
to
him
eat
this
for
food
or
something
else
food
for
body
and
maskull
bit
into
the
root
it
was
white
and
hard
its
white
sap
was
bleeding
it
had
no
taste
but
after
eating
it
he
experienced
a
change
of
perception
the
landscape
without
alteration
of
light
or
outline
became
several
degrees
more
stern
and
sacred
when
he
looked
at
corpang
he
was
impressed
by
his
aspect
of
gothic
awfulness
but
the
perplexed
expression
was
still
in
his
eyes
do
you
spend
all
your
time
here
corpang
occasionally
i
go
above
but
not
what
fastens
you
to
this
gloomy
world
the
search
for
then
it
s
still
a
search
let
us
walk
as
they
resumed
their
journey
across
the
dim
gradually
rising
plain
the
conversation
became
even
more
earnest
in
character
than
before
although
i
was
not
born
here
proceeded
corpang
i
ve
lived
here
for
years
and
during
all
that
time
i
have
been
drawing
nearer
to
thire
as
i
hope
but
there
is
this
peculiarity
about
first
stages
are
richer
in
fruit
and
more
promising
than
the
later
ones
the
longer
a
man
seeks
thire
the
more
he
seems
to
absent
himself
in
the
beginning
he
is
felt
and
known
sometimes
as
a
shape
sometimes
as
a
voice
sometimes
an
overpowering
emotion
later
on
all
is
dry
dark
and
harsh
in
the
soul
then
you
would
think
that
thire
was
a
million
miles
how
do
you
explain
that
when
everything
is
darkest
he
may
be
nearest
but
this
is
troubling
you
my
days
are
spent
in
you
still
persist
though
this
day
darkness
can
t
be
the
ultimate
state
my
questions
will
be
a
silence
ensued
what
do
you
propose
to
show
me
asked
maskull
the
land
is
about
to
grow
wilder
i
am
taking
you
to
the
three
figures
which
were
carved
and
erected
by
an
earlier
race
of
men
there
we
will
and
what
then
if
you
are
truehearted
you
will
see
things
you
will
not
easily
they
had
been
walking
slightly
uphill
in
a
sort
of
trough
between
two
parallel
gently
sloping
downs
the
trough
now
deepened
while
the
hills
on
either
side
grew
steeper
they
were
in
an
ascending
valley
and
as
it
curved
this
way
and
that
the
landscape
was
shut
off
from
view
they
came
to
a
little
spring
bubbling
up
from
the
ground
it
formed
a
trickling
brook
which
was
unlike
all
other
brooks
in
that
it
was
flowing
up
the
valley
instead
of
down
before
long
it
was
joined
by
other
miniature
rivulets
so
that
in
the
end
it
became
a
stream
maskull
kept
looking
at
it
and
puckering
his
forehead
nature
has
other
laws
here
it
seems
nothing
can
exist
here
that
is
not
a
compound
of
the
three
yet
the
water
is
flowing
i
can
t
explain
it
but
there
are
three
wills
in
is
there
no
such
thing
as
pure
thire
can
not
exist
without
amfuse
and
amfuse
can
not
exist
without
maskull
thought
this
over
for
some
minutes
that
must
be
so
he
said
at
last
without
life
there
can
be
no
love
and
without
love
there
can
be
no
religious
in
the
half
light
of
the
land
the
tops
of
the
hills
containing
the
valley
presently
attained
such
a
height
that
they
could
not
be
seen
the
sides
were
steep
and
craggy
while
the
bed
of
the
valley
grew
narrower
at
every
step
not
a
living
organism
was
visible
all
was
unnatural
and
sepulchral
maskull
said
i
feel
as
if
i
were
dead
and
walking
in
another
i
still
do
not
know
what
you
are
doing
here
answered
corpang
why
should
i
go
on
making
a
mystery
of
it
i
came
to
find
that
name
i
ve
under
what
circumstances
you
forget
corpang
walked
along
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
obviously
troubled
who
is
surtur
maskull
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
the
valley
shortly
afterward
narrowed
so
that
the
two
men
touching
fingertips
in
the
middle
could
have
placed
their
free
hands
on
the
rock
walls
on
either
side
it
threatened
to
terminate
in
a
but
just
when
the
road
seemed
least
promising
and
they
were
shut
in
by
cliffs
on
all
sides
a
hitherto
unperceived
bend
brought
them
suddenly
into
the
open
they
emerged
through
a
mere
crack
in
the
line
of
precipices
a
sort
of
huge
natural
corridor
was
running
along
at
right
angles
to
the
way
they
had
come
both
ends
faded
into
obscurity
after
a
few
hundred
yards
right
down
the
centre
of
this
corridor
ran
a
chasm
with
perpendicular
sides
its
width
varied
from
thirty
to
a
hundred
feet
but
its
bottom
could
not
be
seen
on
both
sides
of
the
chasm
facing
one
another
were
platforms
of
rock
twenty
feet
or
so
in
width
they
too
proceeded
in
both
directions
out
of
sight
maskull
and
corpang
emerged
onto
one
of
these
platforms
the
shelf
opposite
was
a
few
feet
higher
than
that
on
which
they
stood
the
platforms
were
backed
by
a
double
line
of
lofty
and
unclimbable
cliffs
whose
tops
were
invisible
the
stream
which
had
accompanied
them
through
the
gap
went
straight
forward
but
instead
of
descending
the
wall
of
the
chasm
as
a
waterfall
it
crossed
from
side
to
side
like
a
liquid
bridge
it
then
disappeared
through
a
cleft
in
the
cliffs
on
the
opposite
side
to
maskull
s
mind
however
even
more
wonderful
than
this
unnatural
phenomenon
was
the
absence
of
shadows
which
was
more
noticeable
here
than
on
the
open
plain
it
made
the
place
look
like
a
hall
of
phantoms
corpang
without
delay
led
the
way
along
the
shelf
to
the
left
when
they
had
walked
about
a
mile
the
gulf
widened
to
two
hundred
feet
three
large
rocks
loomed
up
on
the
ledge
opposite
they
resembled
three
upright
giants
standing
motionless
side
by
side
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
chasm
corpang
and
maskull
drew
nearer
and
then
maskull
saw
that
they
were
statues
each
was
about
thirty
feet
high
and
the
workmanship
was
of
the
rudest
they
represented
naked
men
but
the
limbs
and
trunks
had
been
barely
chipped
into
faces
alone
had
had
care
bestowed
on
them
and
even
these
faces
were
merely
generalised
it
was
obviously
the
work
of
primitive
artists
the
statues
stood
erect
with
knees
closed
and
arms
hanging
straight
down
their
sides
all
three
were
exactly
alike
as
soon
as
they
were
directly
opposite
corpang
halted
is
this
a
representation
of
your
three
beings
asked
maskull
awed
by
the
spectacle
in
spite
of
his
constitutional
audacity
ask
no
questions
but
kneel
replied
corpang
he
dropped
onto
his
own
knees
but
maskull
remained
standing
corpang
covered
his
eyes
with
one
hand
and
prayed
silently
after
a
few
minutes
the
light
sensibly
faded
then
maskull
knelt
as
well
but
he
continued
looking
it
grew
darker
and
darker
until
all
was
like
the
blackest
night
sight
and
sound
no
longer
existed
he
was
alone
with
his
own
spirit
then
one
of
the
three
colossi
came
slowly
into
sight
again
but
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
was
a
living
person
out
of
the
blackness
of
space
a
gigantic
head
and
chest
emerged
illuminated
by
a
mystic
rosy
glow
like
a
mountain
peak
bathed
by
the
rising
sun
as
the
light
grew
stronger
maskull
saw
that
the
flesh
was
translucent
and
that
the
glow
came
from
within
the
limbs
of
the
apparition
were
wreathed
in
mist
before
long
the
features
of
the
face
stood
out
distinctly
it
was
that
of
a
beardless
youth
of
twenty
years
it
possessed
the
beauty
of
a
girl
and
the
daring
force
of
a
man
it
bore
a
mocking
cryptic
smile
maskull
felt
the
fresh
mysterious
thrill
of
mingled
pain
and
rapture
of
one
who
awakes
from
a
deep
sleep
in
midwinter
and
sees
the
gleaming
dark
delicate
colours
of
the
the
vision
smiled
kept
still
and
looked
beyond
him
he
began
to
shudder
with
many
emotions
as
he
gazed
his
poetic
sensibility
acquired
such
a
nervous
and
indefinable
character
that
he
could
endure
it
no
more
he
burst
into
tears
when
he
looked
up
again
the
image
had
nearly
disappeared
and
in
a
few
moments
more
he
was
plunged
back
into
total
darkness
shortly
afterward
a
second
statue
reappeared
it
too
was
transfigured
into
a
living
form
but
maskull
was
unable
to
see
the
details
of
its
face
and
body
because
of
the
brightness
of
the
light
that
radiated
from
them
this
light
which
started
as
pale
gold
ended
as
flaming
golden
fire
it
illumined
the
whole
underground
landscape
the
rock
ledges
the
cliffs
himself
and
corpang
on
their
knees
the
two
unlighted
appeared
as
if
in
sunlight
and
the
shadows
were
black
and
strongly
defined
the
light
carried
heat
with
it
but
a
singular
heat
maskull
was
unaware
of
any
rise
in
temperature
but
he
felt
his
heart
melting
to
womanish
softness
his
male
arrogance
and
egotism
faded
imperceptibly
away
his
personality
seemed
to
disappear
what
was
left
behind
was
not
freedom
of
spirit
or
lightheartedness
but
a
passionate
and
nearly
savage
mental
state
of
pity
and
distress
he
felt
a
tormenting
desire
to
serve
all
this
came
from
the
heat
of
the
statue
and
was
without
an
object
he
glanced
anxiously
around
him
and
fastened
his
eyes
on
corpang
he
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
aroused
him
from
his
praying
you
must
know
what
i
am
feeling
corpang
smiled
sweetly
but
said
nothing
i
care
nothing
for
my
own
affairs
any
more
how
can
i
help
you
so
much
the
better
for
you
maskull
if
you
respond
so
quickly
to
the
invisible
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
the
figure
began
to
vanish
and
the
light
to
die
away
from
the
landscape
maskull
s
emotion
slowly
subsided
but
it
was
not
until
he
was
once
more
in
complete
darkness
that
he
became
master
of
himself
again
then
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
boyish
exhibition
of
enthusiasm
and
thought
ruefully
that
there
must
be
something
wanting
in
his
character
he
got
up
onto
his
feet
the
very
moment
that
he
arose
a
man
s
voice
sounded
not
a
yard
from
his
ear
it
was
hardly
raised
above
a
whisper
but
he
could
distinguish
that
it
was
not
corpang
s
as
he
listened
he
was
unable
to
prevent
himself
from
physically
trembling
maskull
you
are
to
die
said
the
unseen
speaker
who
is
speaking
you
have
only
a
few
hours
of
life
left
don
t
trifle
the
time
maskull
could
bring
nothing
out
you
have
despised
life
went
on
the
voice
do
you
really
imagine
that
this
mighty
world
has
no
meaning
and
that
life
is
a
joke
what
must
i
do
repent
your
murders
commit
no
fresh
ones
pay
honour
to
the
voice
died
away
maskull
waited
in
silence
for
it
to
speak
again
all
remained
still
however
and
the
speaker
appeared
to
have
taken
his
departure
supernatural
horror
seized
him
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
catalepsy
at
that
moment
he
saw
one
of
the
statues
fading
away
from
a
pale
white
glow
to
darkness
he
had
not
previously
seen
it
shining
in
a
few
more
minutes
the
normal
light
of
the
land
returned
corpang
got
up
and
shook
him
out
of
his
trance
maskull
looked
around
but
saw
no
third
person
whose
statue
was
the
last
he
demanded
thire
did
you
hear
me
speaking
i
heard
your
voice
but
no
one
else
i
ve
just
had
my
death
foretold
so
i
suppose
i
have
not
long
to
live
leehallfae
prophesied
the
same
corpang
shook
his
head
what
value
do
you
set
on
life
he
asked
very
little
but
it
s
a
fearful
thing
all
the
your
death
is
no
but
this
they
stopped
talking
a
profound
silence
reigned
neither
of
the
two
men
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
next
or
where
to
go
then
both
of
them
heard
the
sound
of
drumming
it
was
slow
emphatic
and
impressive
a
long
way
off
and
not
loud
but
against
the
background
of
quietness
very
marked
it
appeared
to
come
from
some
point
out
of
sight
to
the
left
of
where
they
were
standing
but
on
the
same
rock
shelf
maskull
s
heart
beat
quickly
what
can
that
sound
be
asked
corpang
peering
into
the
obscurity
it
is
once
again
who
is
surtur
maskull
clutched
his
arm
and
pressed
him
to
silence
a
strange
radiance
was
in
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
drumming
it
increased
in
intensity
and
gradually
occupied
the
whole
scene
things
were
no
longer
seen
by
their
s
light
but
by
this
new
light
it
cast
no
shadows
corpang
s
nostrils
swelled
and
he
held
himself
more
proudly
what
fire
is
that
it
is
they
both
glanced
instinctively
at
the
three
statues
in
the
strange
glow
they
had
undergone
a
change
the
face
of
each
figure
was
clothed
in
the
sordid
and
horrible
crystalman
mask
corpang
cried
out
and
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
what
can
this
mean
he
asked
a
minute
later
it
must
mean
that
life
is
wrong
and
the
creator
of
life
too
whether
he
is
one
person
or
corpang
looked
again
like
a
man
trying
to
accustom
himself
to
a
shocking
sight
dare
we
believe
this
you
must
replied
maskull
you
have
always
served
the
highest
and
you
must
continue
to
do
so
it
has
simply
turned
out
that
thire
is
not
the
corpang
s
face
became
swollen
with
a
kind
of
coarse
anger
life
is
clearly
have
been
seeking
thire
for
a
lifetime
and
now
i
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
crystalman
has
had
eternity
to
practice
his
cunning
in
so
it
s
no
wonder
if
a
man
can
t
see
straight
even
with
the
best
intentions
what
have
you
decided
to
do
the
drumming
seems
to
be
moving
away
will
you
follow
it
maskull
but
where
will
it
take
us
perhaps
out
of
threal
it
sounds
to
me
more
real
than
reality
said
corpang
tell
me
who
is
surtur
surtur
s
world
or
muspel
we
are
told
is
the
original
of
which
this
world
is
a
distorted
copy
crystalman
is
life
but
surtur
is
other
than
how
do
you
know
this
it
has
sprung
together
inspiration
from
experience
from
conversation
with
the
wise
men
of
your
planet
every
hour
it
grows
truer
for
me
and
takes
a
more
definite
corpang
stood
up
squarely
facing
the
three
figures
with
a
harsh
energetic
countenance
stamped
all
over
with
resolution
i
believe
you
maskull
no
better
proof
is
required
than
that
thire
is
not
the
highest
he
is
even
in
a
certain
sense
the
lowest
nothing
but
the
thoroughly
false
and
base
could
stoop
to
such
deceits
i
am
coming
with
don
t
play
the
traitor
these
signs
may
be
for
you
and
not
for
me
at
all
and
if
you
leave
i
make
no
promises
i
don
t
ask
you
to
come
with
me
if
you
prefer
to
stay
in
your
little
world
or
if
you
have
any
doubts
about
it
you
had
better
not
don
t
talk
like
that
i
shall
never
forget
your
service
to
me
let
us
make
haste
or
we
shall
lose
the
corpang
started
off
more
eagerly
than
maskull
they
walked
fast
in
the
direction
of
the
drumming
for
upward
of
two
miles
the
path
went
along
the
ledge
without
any
change
of
level
the
mysterious
radiance
gradually
departed
and
was
replaced
by
the
normal
light
of
threal
the
rhythmical
beats
continued
but
a
very
long
way
was
able
to
diminish
the
distance
what
kind
of
man
are
you
corpang
suddenly
broke
out
in
what
respect
how
do
you
come
to
be
on
such
terms
with
the
invisible
how
is
it
that
i
ve
never
had
this
experience
before
i
met
you
in
spite
of
my
ending
prayers
and
mortifications
in
what
way
are
you
superior
to
me
to
hear
voices
perhaps
can
t
be
made
a
profession
replied
maskull
i
have
a
simple
and
unoccupied
may
be
why
i
sometimes
hear
things
that
up
to
the
present
you
have
not
been
able
corpang
darkened
and
kept
silent
and
then
maskull
saw
through
to
his
pride
the
ledge
presently
began
to
rise
they
were
high
above
the
platform
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gulf
the
road
then
curved
sharply
to
the
right
and
they
passed
over
the
abyss
and
the
other
ledge
as
by
a
bridge
coming
out
upon
the
top
of
the
opposite
cliffs
a
new
line
of
precipices
immediately
confronted
them
they
followed
the
drumming
along
the
base
of
these
heights
but
as
they
were
passing
the
mouth
of
a
large
cave
the
sound
came
from
its
recesses
and
they
turned
their
steps
inward
this
leads
to
the
outer
world
remarked
corpang
i
ve
occasionally
been
there
by
this
then
that
s
where
it
is
taking
us
no
doubt
i
confess
i
shan
t
be
sorry
to
see
sunlight
once
can
you
find
time
to
think
of
sunlight
asked
corpang
with
a
rough
smile
i
love
the
sun
and
perhaps
i
m
rather
lacking
in
the
spirit
of
a
yet
for
all
that
you
may
get
there
before
don
t
be
bitter
said
maskull
i
ll
tell
you
another
thing
muspel
can
t
be
willed
for
the
simple
reason
that
muspel
does
not
concern
the
will
to
will
is
a
property
of
this
then
what
is
your
journey
for
it
s
one
thing
to
walk
to
a
destination
and
to
linger
over
the
walk
and
quite
another
to
run
there
at
top
perhaps
i
m
not
so
easily
deceived
as
you
think
said
corpang
with
another
smile
the
light
persisted
in
the
cave
the
path
narrowed
and
became
a
steep
ascent
then
the
angle
became
one
of
degrees
and
they
had
to
climb
the
tunnel
grew
so
confined
that
maskull
was
reminded
of
the
confined
dreams
of
his
childhood
not
long
afterward
daylight
appeared
they
hastened
to
complete
the
last
stage
maskull
rushed
out
first
into
the
world
of
colours
and
all
dirty
and
bleeding
from
numerous
scratches
stood
blinking
on
a
hillside
bathed
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
corpang
followed
closely
at
his
heels
he
was
obliged
to
shield
his
eyes
with
his
hands
for
a
few
minutes
so
unaccustomed
was
he
to
branchspell
s
blinding
rays
the
drum
beats
have
stopped
he
exclaimed
suddenly
you
can
t
expect
music
all
the
time
answered
maskull
dryly
we
mustn
t
be
but
now
we
have
no
guide
we
re
no
better
off
than
well
tormance
is
a
big
place
but
i
have
an
infallible
rule
corpang
as
i
come
from
the
south
i
always
go
due
that
will
take
us
to
maskull
gazed
at
the
fantastically
piled
rocks
all
around
them
i
saw
these
rocks
from
matterplay
the
mountains
look
as
far
off
now
as
they
did
then
and
there
s
not
much
of
the
day
left
how
far
is
lichstorm
from
here
corpang
looked
away
to
the
distant
range
i
don
t
know
but
unless
a
miracle
happens
we
shan
t
get
there
i
have
a
feeling
said
maskull
that
we
shall
not
only
get
there
tonight
but
that
tonight
will
be
the
most
important
in
my
and
he
sat
down
passively
to
rest
chapter
haunte
while
maskull
sat
corpang
walked
restlessly
to
and
fro
swinging
his
arms
he
had
lost
his
staff
his
face
was
inflamed
with
suppressed
impatience
which
accentuated
its
natural
coarseness
at
last
he
stopped
short
in
front
of
maskull
and
looked
down
at
him
what
do
you
intend
to
do
maskull
glanced
up
and
idly
waved
his
hand
toward
the
distant
mountains
since
we
can
t
walk
we
must
for
what
i
don
t
know
how
s
this
though
those
peaks
have
changed
colour
from
red
to
yes
the
lich
wind
is
travelling
this
the
lich
wind
it
s
the
atmosphere
of
lichstorm
it
always
clings
to
the
mountains
but
when
the
wind
blows
from
the
north
it
comes
as
far
as
it
s
a
sort
of
fog
then
a
peculiar
sort
for
they
say
it
excites
the
sexual
so
we
are
to
have
lovemaking
said
maskull
laughing
perhaps
you
won
t
find
it
so
joyous
replied
corpang
a
little
grimly
but
tell
peaks
how
do
they
preserve
their
balance
corpang
gazed
at
the
distant
overhanging
summits
which
were
fast
fading
into
obscurity
passion
keeps
them
from
maskull
laughed
again
he
was
feeling
a
strange
disturbance
of
spirit
what
the
love
of
rock
for
rock
it
is
comical
but
we
ll
take
a
closer
peep
at
them
presently
beyond
the
mountains
is
barey
is
it
not
and
then
the
ocean
but
what
is
the
name
of
that
ocean
that
is
told
only
to
those
who
die
beside
is
the
secret
so
precious
corpang
branchspell
was
nearing
the
horizon
in
the
west
there
were
more
than
two
hours
of
daylight
remaining
the
air
all
around
them
became
murky
it
was
a
thin
mist
neither
damp
nor
cold
the
lichstorm
range
now
appeared
only
as
a
blur
on
the
sky
the
air
was
electric
and
tingling
and
was
exciting
in
its
effect
maskull
felt
a
sort
of
emotional
inflammation
as
though
a
very
slight
external
cause
would
serve
to
overturn
his
corpang
stood
silent
with
a
mouth
like
iron
maskull
kept
looking
toward
a
high
pile
of
rocks
in
the
vicinity
that
seems
to
me
a
good
watchtower
perhaps
we
shall
see
something
from
the
without
waiting
for
his
companion
s
opinion
he
began
to
scramble
up
the
tor
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
standing
on
the
summit
corpang
joined
him
from
their
viewpoint
they
saw
the
whole
countryside
sloping
down
to
the
sea
which
appeared
as
a
mere
flash
of
glittering
water
leaving
all
that
however
maskull
s
eyes
immediately
fastened
themselves
on
a
small
object
about
two
miles
away
which
was
travelling
rapidly
toward
them
suspended
only
a
few
feet
in
the
air
what
do
you
make
of
that
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
corpang
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
within
two
minutes
the
flying
object
whatever
it
was
had
diminished
the
distance
between
them
by
one
half
it
resembled
a
boat
more
and
more
but
its
flight
was
erratic
rather
than
smooth
its
nose
was
continually
jerking
upward
and
downward
and
from
side
to
side
maskull
now
made
out
a
man
sitting
in
the
stern
and
what
looked
like
a
large
dead
animal
lying
amidships
as
the
aerial
craft
drew
nearer
he
observed
a
thick
blue
haze
underneath
it
and
a
similar
haze
behind
but
the
front
facing
them
was
clear
here
must
be
what
we
are
waiting
for
corpang
but
what
on
earth
carries
it
he
stroked
his
beard
contemplatively
and
then
fearing
that
they
had
not
been
seen
stepped
onto
the
highest
rock
bellowed
loudly
and
made
wild
motions
with
his
arm
the
which
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
distant
slightly
altered
its
course
now
heading
toward
them
in
a
way
that
left
no
doubt
that
the
steersman
had
detected
their
presence
the
boat
slackened
speed
until
it
was
travelling
no
faster
than
a
walking
man
but
the
irregularity
of
its
movements
continued
it
was
shaped
rather
queerly
about
twenty
feet
long
its
straight
sides
tapered
off
from
a
flat
bow
four
feet
broad
to
a
stern
the
flat
bottom
was
not
above
ten
feet
from
the
ground
it
was
undecked
and
carried
only
one
living
occupant
the
other
object
they
had
distinguished
was
really
the
carcass
of
an
animal
of
about
the
size
of
a
large
sheep
the
blue
haze
trailing
behind
the
boat
appeared
to
emanate
from
the
glittering
point
of
a
short
upright
pole
fastened
in
the
stern
when
the
craft
was
within
a
few
feet
of
them
and
they
were
looking
down
at
it
in
wonder
from
above
the
man
removed
this
pole
and
covered
the
brightly
shining
tip
with
a
cap
the
forward
motion
then
ceased
altogether
and
the
boat
began
to
drift
hither
and
thither
but
still
it
remained
suspended
in
the
air
while
the
haze
underneath
persisted
finally
the
broad
side
came
gently
up
against
the
pile
of
rocks
on
which
they
were
standing
the
steersman
jumped
ashore
and
immediately
clambered
up
to
meet
them
maskull
offered
him
a
hand
but
he
refused
it
disdainfully
he
was
a
young
man
of
middle
height
he
wore
a
fur
garment
his
limbs
were
quite
ordinary
but
his
trunk
was
disproportionately
long
and
he
had
the
biggest
and
deepest
chest
that
maskull
had
ever
seen
in
a
man
his
hairless
face
was
sharp
pointed
and
ugly
with
protruding
teeth
and
a
spiteful
grinning
expression
his
eyes
and
brows
sloped
upward
on
his
forehead
was
an
organ
which
looked
as
though
it
had
been
was
a
mere
disagreeable
stump
of
flesh
his
hair
was
short
and
thin
maskull
could
not
name
the
colour
of
his
skin
but
it
seemed
to
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
jale
as
green
to
red
once
up
the
stranger
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
scrutinising
the
two
companions
through
lids
all
the
time
smiling
insolently
maskull
was
all
eagerness
to
exchange
words
but
did
not
care
to
be
the
first
to
speak
corpang
stood
moodily
a
little
in
the
background
what
men
are
you
demanded
the
aerial
navigator
at
last
his
voice
was
extremely
loud
and
possessed
a
most
unpleasant
timbre
it
sounded
to
maskull
like
a
large
volume
of
air
trying
to
force
its
way
through
a
narrow
orifice
i
am
maskull
my
friend
is
corpang
he
comes
from
threal
but
where
i
come
from
don
t
i
am
haunte
from
where
may
that
be
half
an
hour
ago
i
could
have
shown
it
to
you
but
now
it
has
got
too
murky
it
is
a
mountain
in
are
you
returning
there
now
and
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
there
in
that
boat
will
it
accommodate
us
too
what
are
you
for
lichstorm
as
well
what
can
you
want
there
to
see
the
sights
responded
maskull
with
twinkling
eyes
but
first
of
all
to
dine
i
can
t
remember
having
eaten
all
day
you
seem
to
have
been
hunting
to
some
purpose
so
we
won
t
lack
for
haunte
eyed
him
quizzically
you
certainly
don
t
lack
impudence
however
i
m
a
man
of
that
sort
myself
and
it
is
the
sort
i
prefer
your
friend
now
would
probably
rather
starve
than
ask
a
meal
of
a
stranger
he
looks
to
me
just
like
a
bewildered
toad
dragged
up
out
of
a
dark
maskull
took
corpang
s
arm
and
constrained
him
to
silence
where
have
you
been
hunting
haunte
matterplay
i
had
the
worst
speared
one
wold
horse
and
there
it
what
is
lichstorm
like
there
are
men
there
and
there
are
women
there
but
there
are
no
women
as
with
what
do
you
call
persons
of
mixed
sex
like
yourself
in
lichstorm
the
sexes
are
i
have
always
regarded
myself
as
a
very
likely
you
have
but
the
test
is
do
you
hate
and
fear
women
why
do
you
haunte
grinned
and
showed
his
teeth
things
are
different
in
lichstorm
so
you
want
to
see
the
sights
i
confess
i
am
curious
to
see
your
women
for
example
after
what
you
then
i
ll
introduce
you
to
he
paused
a
moment
after
making
this
remark
and
then
suddenly
uttered
a
great
bass
laugh
so
that
his
chest
shook
let
us
share
the
joke
said
maskull
oh
you
ll
understand
it
if
you
play
pranks
with
me
i
won
t
stand
on
ceremony
with
haunte
laughed
again
i
won
t
be
the
one
to
play
pranks
sullenbode
will
be
deeply
obliged
to
me
if
i
don
t
visit
her
myself
as
often
as
she
would
like
i
m
always
glad
to
serve
her
in
other
ways
well
you
shall
have
your
boat
maskull
rubbed
his
nose
doubtfully
if
the
sexes
hate
one
another
in
your
land
is
it
because
passion
is
weaker
or
stronger
in
other
parts
of
the
world
there
is
soft
passion
but
in
lichstorm
there
is
hard
but
what
do
you
call
hard
passion
where
men
are
called
to
women
by
pain
and
not
i
intend
to
understand
before
i
ve
yes
answered
haunte
with
a
taunting
look
it
would
be
a
pity
to
let
the
chance
slip
since
you
re
going
to
it
was
now
corpang
s
turn
to
take
maskull
by
the
arm
this
journey
will
end
why
so
your
goal
was
muspel
a
short
while
ago
now
it
is
let
me
alone
said
maskull
give
luck
a
slack
rein
what
brought
this
boat
here
what
is
this
talk
about
muspel
demanded
haunte
corpang
caught
his
shoulder
roughly
and
stared
straight
into
his
eyes
what
do
you
know
not
much
but
something
perhaps
ask
me
at
supper
now
it
is
high
time
to
start
navigating
the
mountains
by
night
isn
t
child
s
play
let
me
tell
i
shall
not
forget
said
corpang
maskull
gazed
down
at
the
boat
are
we
to
get
in
gently
my
friend
it
s
only
canework
and
first
of
all
you
might
enlighten
me
as
to
how
you
have
contrived
to
dispense
with
the
laws
of
haunte
smiled
sarcastically
a
secret
in
your
ear
maskull
all
laws
are
female
a
true
male
is
an
the
i
don
t
the
great
body
of
the
earth
is
continually
giving
out
female
particles
and
the
male
parts
of
rocks
and
living
bodies
are
equally
continually
trying
to
reach
them
that
s
then
how
do
you
manage
with
your
boat
my
two
male
stones
do
the
work
the
one
underneath
the
boat
prevents
it
from
falling
to
the
ground
the
one
in
the
stern
shuts
it
off
from
solid
objects
in
the
rear
the
only
part
of
the
boat
attracted
by
any
part
of
the
earth
is
the
bow
for
that
s
the
only
part
the
light
of
the
male
stones
does
not
fall
on
so
in
that
direction
the
boat
and
what
are
these
wondrous
male
stones
they
really
are
male
stones
there
is
nothing
female
in
them
they
are
showering
out
male
sparks
all
the
time
these
sparks
devour
all
the
female
particles
rising
from
the
earth
no
female
particles
are
left
over
to
attract
the
male
parts
of
the
boat
and
so
they
are
not
in
the
least
attracted
in
that
maskull
ruminated
for
a
minute
with
your
hunting
and
boatbuilding
and
science
you
seem
a
very
handy
skilful
fellow
haunte
but
the
sun
s
sinking
and
we
d
better
get
down
first
then
and
shift
that
carcass
farther
forward
then
you
and
your
gloomy
friend
can
sit
maskull
immediately
climbed
down
and
dropped
himself
into
the
boat
but
then
he
received
a
surprise
the
moment
he
stood
on
the
frail
bottom
still
clinging
to
the
rock
not
only
did
his
weight
entirely
disappear
as
though
he
were
floating
in
some
heavy
medium
like
salt
water
but
the
rock
he
held
onto
drew
him
as
by
a
mild
current
of
electricity
and
he
was
able
to
withdraw
his
hands
only
with
difficulty
after
the
first
moment
s
shock
he
quietly
accepted
the
new
order
of
things
and
set
about
shifting
the
carcass
since
there
was
no
weight
in
the
boat
this
was
effected
without
any
great
labour
corpang
then
descended
the
astonishing
physical
change
had
no
power
to
disturb
his
settled
composure
which
was
founded
on
moral
ideas
haunte
came
last
grasping
the
staff
which
held
the
upper
male
stone
he
proceeded
to
erect
it
after
removing
the
cap
maskull
then
obtained
his
first
near
view
of
the
mysterious
light
which
by
counteracting
the
forces
of
nature
acted
indirectly
not
only
as
elevator
but
as
motive
force
in
the
last
ruddy
gleams
of
the
great
sun
its
rays
were
obscured
and
it
looked
little
more
impressive
than
an
extremely
brilliant
scintillating
jewel
but
its
power
could
be
gauged
by
the
visible
coloured
mist
that
it
threw
out
for
many
yards
around
the
steering
was
effected
by
means
of
a
shutter
attached
by
a
cord
to
the
top
of
the
staff
which
could
be
so
manipulated
that
any
segment
of
the
male
stone
s
rays
or
all
the
rays
or
none
at
all
could
be
shut
off
at
will
no
sooner
was
the
staff
raised
than
the
aerial
vessel
quietly
detached
itself
from
the
rock
to
which
it
had
been
drawn
and
passed
slowly
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
branchspell
sank
below
the
horizon
the
gathering
mist
blotted
out
everything
outside
a
radius
of
a
few
miles
the
air
grew
cool
and
fresh
soon
the
rock
masses
ceased
on
the
great
rising
plain
haunte
withdrew
the
shutter
entirely
and
the
boat
gathered
full
speed
you
say
that
navigation
among
the
mountains
is
difficult
at
night
exclaimed
maskull
i
would
have
thought
it
haunte
grunted
you
will
have
to
take
risks
and
think
yourself
fortunate
if
you
come
off
with
nothing
worse
than
a
cracked
skull
but
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
go
on
disturbing
me
with
your
chitchat
we
shan
t
get
as
far
as
the
thereafter
maskull
was
silent
the
twilight
deepened
the
murk
grew
denser
there
was
little
to
look
at
but
much
to
feel
the
motion
of
the
boat
which
was
due
to
the
struggle
between
the
male
stones
and
the
force
of
gravitation
resembled
in
an
exaggerated
fashion
the
violent
tossing
of
a
small
craft
on
a
choppy
sea
the
two
passengers
became
unhappy
haunte
from
his
seat
in
the
stern
gazed
at
them
sardonically
with
one
eye
the
darkness
now
came
on
rapidly
about
ninety
minutes
after
the
commencement
of
the
voyage
they
arrived
at
the
foothills
of
lichstorm
they
began
to
mount
there
was
no
daylight
left
to
see
by
beneath
them
however
on
both
sides
of
them
and
in
the
rear
the
landscape
was
lighted
up
for
a
considerable
distance
by
the
now
vivid
blue
rays
of
the
twin
male
stones
ahead
where
these
rays
did
not
shine
haunte
was
guided
by
the
nature
of
the
rocks
grass
and
trees
these
were
faintly
phosphorescent
the
vegetation
shone
out
more
strongly
than
the
soil
the
moon
was
not
shining
and
there
were
no
stars
maskull
therefore
inferred
that
the
upper
atmosphere
was
dense
with
mist
once
or
twice
from
his
sensations
of
choking
he
thought
that
they
were
entering
a
fogbank
but
it
was
a
strange
kind
of
fog
for
it
had
the
effect
of
doubling
the
intensity
of
every
light
in
front
of
them
whenever
this
happened
nightmare
feelings
attacked
him
he
experienced
transitory
unreasoning
fright
and
horror
now
they
passed
high
above
the
valley
that
separated
the
foothills
from
the
mountains
themselves
the
boat
began
an
ascent
of
many
thousands
of
feet
and
as
the
cliffs
were
near
haunte
had
to
manoeuvre
carefully
with
the
rear
light
in
order
to
keep
clear
of
them
maskull
watched
the
delicacy
of
his
movements
not
without
admiration
a
long
time
went
by
it
grew
much
colder
the
air
was
damp
and
drafty
the
fog
began
to
deposit
something
like
snow
on
their
persons
maskull
kept
sweating
with
terror
not
because
of
the
danger
they
were
in
but
because
of
the
cloud
banks
that
continued
to
envelop
them
they
cleared
the
first
line
of
precipices
still
mounting
but
this
time
with
a
forward
motion
as
could
be
seen
by
the
vapours
illuminated
by
the
male
stones
through
which
they
passed
they
were
soon
altogether
out
of
sight
of
solid
ground
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
the
moon
broke
through
in
the
upper
atmosphere
thick
masses
of
fog
were
seen
crawling
hither
and
thither
broken
in
many
places
by
thin
rifts
of
sky
through
one
of
which
teargeld
was
shining
below
them
to
their
left
a
gigantic
peak
glittering
with
green
ice
showed
itself
for
a
few
seconds
and
was
then
swallowed
up
again
all
the
rest
of
the
world
was
hidden
by
the
mist
the
moon
went
in
again
maskull
had
seen
quite
enough
to
make
him
long
for
the
aerial
voyage
to
end
the
light
from
the
male
stones
presently
illuminated
the
face
of
a
new
cliff
it
was
grand
rugged
and
perpendicular
upward
downward
and
on
both
sides
it
faded
imperceptibly
into
the
night
after
coasting
it
a
little
way
they
observed
a
shelf
of
rock
jutting
out
it
was
square
measuring
about
a
dozen
feet
each
way
green
snow
covered
it
to
a
depth
of
some
inches
immediately
behind
it
was
a
dark
slit
in
the
rock
which
promised
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
cave
haunte
skilfully
landed
the
boat
on
this
platform
standing
up
he
raised
the
staff
bearing
the
keel
light
and
lowered
the
other
then
removed
both
male
stones
which
he
continued
to
hold
in
his
hand
his
face
was
thrown
into
strong
relief
by
the
vivid
sparkling
rays
it
looked
rather
surly
do
we
get
out
inquired
maskull
yes
i
live
thanks
for
the
successful
end
of
a
dangerous
yes
it
has
been
corpang
jumped
onto
the
platform
he
was
smiling
coarsely
there
has
been
no
danger
for
our
destinies
lie
elsewhere
you
are
merely
a
ferryman
is
that
so
returned
haunte
with
a
most
unpleasant
laugh
i
thought
i
was
carrying
men
not
where
are
we
asked
maskull
as
he
spoke
he
got
out
but
haunte
remained
standing
a
minute
in
the
boat
this
is
second
highest
mountain
in
the
which
is
the
highest
then
adage
between
sarclash
and
adage
there
is
a
long
difficult
in
places
about
halfway
along
the
ridge
at
the
lowest
point
lies
the
top
of
the
mornstab
pass
which
goes
through
to
barey
now
you
know
the
lay
of
the
does
the
woman
sullenbode
live
near
here
near
haunte
grinned
he
leaped
out
of
the
boat
and
pushing
past
the
others
without
ceremony
walked
straight
into
the
cave
maskull
followed
with
corpang
at
his
heels
a
few
stone
steps
led
to
a
doorway
curtained
by
the
skin
of
some
large
beast
their
host
pushed
his
way
in
never
offering
to
hold
the
skin
aside
for
them
maskull
made
no
comment
but
grabbed
it
with
his
fist
and
tugged
it
away
from
its
fastenings
to
the
ground
haunte
looked
at
the
skin
and
then
stared
hard
at
maskull
with
his
disagreeable
smile
but
neither
said
anything
the
place
in
which
they
found
themselves
was
a
large
oblong
cavern
with
walls
floor
and
ceiling
of
natural
rock
there
were
two
doorways
that
by
which
they
had
entered
and
another
of
smaller
size
directly
opposite
the
cave
was
cold
and
cheerless
a
damp
draft
passed
from
door
to
door
many
skins
of
wild
animals
lay
scattered
on
the
ground
a
number
of
lumps
of
flesh
were
hanging
on
a
string
along
the
wall
and
a
few
bulging
liquor
skins
reposed
in
a
corner
there
were
tusks
horns
and
bones
everywhere
resting
against
the
wall
were
two
short
hunting
spears
having
beautiful
crystal
heads
haunte
set
down
the
two
male
stones
on
the
ground
near
the
farther
door
thire
light
illuminated
the
whole
cave
he
then
walked
over
to
the
meat
and
snatching
a
large
piece
began
to
gnaw
it
ravenously
are
we
invited
to
the
feast
asked
maskull
haunte
pointed
to
the
hanging
flesh
and
to
the
liquor
skins
but
did
not
pause
in
his
chewing
where
s
a
cup
inquired
maskull
lifting
one
of
the
skins
haunte
indicated
a
clay
goblet
lying
on
the
floor
maskull
picked
it
up
undid
the
neck
of
the
skin
and
resting
it
under
his
arm
filled
the
cup
tasting
the
liquor
he
discovered
it
to
be
raw
spirit
he
tossed
off
the
draught
and
then
felt
much
better
the
second
cupful
he
proffered
to
corpang
the
latter
took
a
single
sip
swallowed
it
and
then
passed
the
cup
back
without
a
word
he
refused
to
drink
again
as
long
as
they
were
in
the
cave
maskull
finished
the
cup
and
began
to
throw
off
care
going
to
the
meat
line
he
took
down
a
large
double
handful
and
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
skins
to
eat
at
his
ease
the
flesh
was
tough
and
coarse
but
he
had
never
tasted
anything
sweeter
he
could
not
understand
the
flavour
which
was
not
surprising
in
a
world
of
strange
animals
the
meal
proceeded
in
silence
corpang
ate
sparingly
standing
up
and
afterward
lay
down
on
a
bundle
of
furs
his
bold
eyes
watched
all
the
movements
of
the
other
two
haunte
had
not
drunk
as
yet
at
last
maskull
concluded
his
meal
he
emptied
another
cup
sighed
pleasantly
and
prepared
to
talk
now
explain
further
about
your
women
haunte
fetched
another
skin
of
liquor
and
a
second
cup
he
tore
off
the
string
with
his
teeth
and
poured
out
and
drank
cup
after
cup
in
quick
succession
then
he
sat
down
crossed
his
legs
and
turned
to
maskull
well
so
they
are
objectionable
they
are
deadly
in
what
way
can
they
possibly
be
deadly
you
will
learn
i
was
watching
you
in
the
boat
maskull
you
had
some
bad
feelings
eh
i
don
t
conceal
it
there
were
times
when
i
felt
as
if
i
were
struggling
with
a
nightmare
what
caused
it
the
female
atmosphere
of
lichstorm
sexual
i
had
no
that
was
first
stage
nature
tickles
your
people
into
marriage
but
it
tortures
us
wait
till
you
get
outside
you
ll
have
a
return
of
those
ten
times
worse
the
drink
you
ve
had
will
see
to
that
how
do
you
suppose
it
will
all
end
if
i
knew
i
wouldn
t
be
asking
you
haunte
laughed
loudly
you
mean
it
will
end
in
my
seeking
sullenbode
but
what
will
come
of
it
maskull
what
will
she
give
you
sweet
fainting
feminine
voluptuousness
maskull
coolly
drank
another
cup
and
why
should
she
give
all
that
to
a
passerby
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
hasn
t
it
to
give
no
what
she
will
give
you
and
what
you
ll
accept
from
her
because
you
can
t
help
it
insanity
possibly
you
may
be
talking
sense
but
it
sounds
like
raving
to
me
why
should
i
accept
insanity
and
death
because
your
passion
will
force
you
what
about
yourself
maskull
asked
biting
his
nails
oh
i
have
my
male
stones
i
am
is
that
all
that
prevents
you
from
being
like
other
men
yes
but
don
t
attempt
any
tricks
maskull
went
on
drinking
steadily
and
said
nothing
for
a
time
so
men
and
women
here
are
hostile
to
each
other
and
love
is
unknown
he
proceeded
at
last
that
magic
word
shall
i
tell
you
what
love
is
maskull
love
between
male
and
female
is
impossible
when
maskull
loves
a
woman
it
is
maskull
s
female
ancestors
who
are
loving
her
but
here
in
this
land
the
men
are
pure
males
they
have
drawn
nothing
from
the
female
where
do
the
male
stones
come
from
oh
they
are
not
freaks
there
must
be
whole
beds
of
the
stuff
somewhere
it
is
all
that
prevents
the
world
from
being
a
pure
female
world
it
would
be
one
big
mass
of
heavy
sweetness
without
individual
yet
this
same
sweetness
is
torturing
to
men
the
life
of
an
absolute
male
is
fierce
an
excess
of
life
is
dangerous
to
the
body
how
can
it
be
anything
else
than
torturing
corpang
now
sat
up
suddenly
and
addressed
haunte
i
remind
you
of
your
promise
to
tell
about
haunte
regarded
him
with
a
malevolent
smile
ha
the
underground
man
has
come
to
yes
tell
us
put
in
maskull
carelessly
haunte
drank
and
laughed
a
little
well
the
tale
s
short
and
hardly
worth
telling
but
since
you
re
interested
a
stranger
came
here
five
years
ago
inquiring
after
his
name
was
lodd
he
came
from
the
east
he
came
up
to
me
one
bright
morning
in
summer
outside
this
very
cave
if
you
ask
me
to
describe
can
t
imagine
a
second
man
like
him
he
looked
so
proud
noble
superior
that
i
felt
my
own
blood
to
be
dirty
by
comparison
you
can
guess
i
don
t
have
this
feeling
for
everyone
now
that
i
am
recalling
him
he
was
not
so
much
superior
as
different
i
was
so
impressed
that
i
rose
and
talked
to
him
standing
he
inquired
the
direction
of
the
mountain
adage
he
went
on
to
say
they
say
is
sometimes
seen
there
what
do
you
know
of
such
a
thing
i
told
him
the
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
then
he
went
on
well
i
am
going
to
adage
and
tell
those
who
come
after
me
on
the
same
errand
that
they
had
better
do
the
same
that
was
the
whole
conversation
he
started
on
his
way
and
i
ve
never
seen
him
or
heard
of
him
so
you
didn
t
have
the
curiosity
to
follow
him
no
because
the
moment
he
had
turned
his
back
all
my
interest
in
the
man
somehow
seemed
to
probably
because
he
was
useless
to
corpang
glanced
at
maskull
our
road
is
marked
out
for
so
it
would
appear
said
maskull
indifferently
the
talk
flagged
for
a
time
maskull
felt
the
silence
oppressive
and
grew
restless
what
do
you
call
the
colour
of
your
skin
haunte
as
i
saw
it
in
daylight
it
struck
me
as
dolm
said
haunte
a
compound
of
ulfire
and
blue
explained
corpang
now
i
know
these
colours
are
puzzling
for
a
what
colours
have
you
in
your
world
asked
corpang
only
three
primary
ones
but
here
you
seem
to
have
five
though
how
it
comes
about
i
can
t
there
are
two
sets
of
three
primary
colours
here
said
corpang
but
as
one
of
the
identical
in
both
sets
altogether
there
are
five
primary
why
two
sets
produced
by
the
two
suns
branchspell
produces
blue
yellow
and
red
alppain
ulfire
blue
and
it
s
remarkable
that
explanation
has
never
occurred
to
me
so
here
you
have
another
illustration
of
the
necessary
trinity
of
nature
blue
is
existence
it
is
darkness
seen
through
light
a
contrasting
of
existence
and
nothingness
yellow
is
relation
in
yellow
light
we
see
the
relation
of
objects
in
the
clearest
way
red
is
feeling
when
we
see
red
we
are
thrown
back
on
our
personal
feelings
as
regards
the
alppain
colours
blue
stands
in
the
middle
and
is
therefore
not
existence
but
relation
ulfire
is
existence
so
it
must
be
a
different
sort
of
haunte
yawned
there
are
marvellous
philosophers
in
your
underground
maskull
got
up
and
looked
about
him
where
does
that
other
door
lead
to
better
explore
said
haunte
maskull
took
him
at
his
word
and
strolled
across
the
cave
flinging
the
curtain
aside
and
disappearing
into
the
night
haunte
rose
abruptly
and
hurried
after
him
corpang
too
got
to
his
feet
he
went
over
to
the
untouched
spirit
skins
untied
the
necks
and
allowed
the
contents
to
gush
out
on
to
the
floor
next
he
took
the
hunting
spears
and
snapped
off
the
points
between
his
hands
before
he
had
time
to
resume
his
seat
haunte
and
maskull
reappeared
the
host
s
quick
shifty
eyes
at
once
took
in
what
had
happened
he
smiled
and
turned
pale
you
haven
t
been
idle
corpang
fixed
haunte
with
his
bold
heavy
gaze
i
thought
it
well
to
draw
your
maskull
burst
out
laughing
the
toad
s
come
into
the
light
to
some
purpose
haunte
who
would
have
expected
it
haunte
after
staring
hard
at
corpang
for
two
or
three
minutes
suddenly
uttered
a
strange
cry
like
an
evil
spirit
and
flung
himself
upon
him
the
two
men
began
to
wrestle
like
wildcats
they
were
as
often
on
the
floor
as
on
their
legs
and
maskull
could
not
see
who
was
getting
the
better
of
it
he
made
no
attempt
to
separate
them
a
thought
came
into
his
head
and
snatching
up
the
two
male
stones
he
ran
with
them
laughing
through
the
upper
doorway
into
the
open
night
air
the
door
overlooked
an
abyss
on
another
face
of
the
mountain
a
narrow
ledge
sprinkled
with
green
snow
wound
along
the
cliff
to
the
right
it
was
the
only
available
path
he
pitched
the
pebbles
over
the
edge
of
the
chasm
although
hard
and
heavy
in
his
hand
they
sank
more
like
feathers
than
stones
and
left
a
long
trail
of
vapour
behind
while
maskull
was
still
watching
them
disappear
haunte
came
rushing
out
of
the
cavern
followed
by
corpang
he
gripped
maskull
s
arm
excitedly
what
in
krag
s
name
have
you
done
overboard
they
have
gone
replied
maskull
renewing
his
laughter
you
accursed
madman
haunte
s
luminous
colour
came
and
went
just
as
though
his
internal
light
were
breathing
then
he
grew
suddenly
calm
by
a
supreme
exertion
of
his
will
you
know
this
kills
me
haven
t
you
been
doing
your
best
this
last
hour
to
make
me
ripe
for
sullenbode
well
then
cheer
up
and
join
the
pleasure
party
you
say
it
as
a
joke
but
it
is
the
miserable
haunte
s
jeering
malevolence
had
completely
vanished
he
looked
a
sick
somehow
his
face
had
become
nobler
i
would
be
very
sorry
for
you
haunte
if
it
did
not
entail
my
being
also
very
sorry
for
myself
we
are
now
all
three
together
on
the
same
doesn
t
appear
to
have
struck
you
but
why
this
errand
at
all
asked
corpang
quietly
can
t
you
men
exercise
till
you
have
arrived
out
of
danger
haunte
fixed
him
with
wild
eyes
no
the
phantoms
come
trooping
in
on
me
he
sat
down
moodily
but
the
next
minute
was
up
again
and
i
can
not
wait
the
game
is
soon
afterward
by
silent
consent
they
began
to
walk
the
ledge
haunte
in
front
it
was
narrow
ascending
and
slippery
so
that
extreme
caution
was
demanded
the
way
was
lighted
by
the
snow
and
rocks
when
they
had
covered
about
half
a
mile
maskull
who
went
second
of
the
party
staggered
caught
the
cliff
and
finally
sat
down
the
drink
works
my
old
sensations
are
returning
but
haunte
turned
back
then
you
are
a
doomed
maskull
though
fully
conscious
of
his
companions
and
situation
imagined
that
he
was
being
oppressed
by
a
black
shapeless
supernatural
being
who
was
trying
to
clasp
him
he
was
filled
with
horror
trembled
violently
yet
could
not
move
a
limb
sweat
tumbled
off
his
face
in
great
drops
the
waking
nightmare
lasted
a
long
time
but
during
that
space
it
kept
coming
and
going
at
one
moment
the
vision
seemed
on
the
point
of
departing
the
next
it
almost
took
he
knew
would
be
his
death
suddenly
it
vanished
was
free
a
fresh
spring
breeze
fanned
his
face
he
heard
the
slow
solitary
singing
of
a
sweet
bird
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
poem
had
shot
together
in
his
soul
such
flashing
heartbreaking
joy
he
had
never
experienced
before
in
all
his
life
almost
immediately
that
too
vanished
sitting
up
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
swayed
quietly
like
one
who
has
been
visited
by
an
angel
your
colour
changed
to
white
said
corpang
what
happened
i
passed
through
torture
to
love
replied
maskull
simply
he
stood
up
haunte
gazed
at
him
sombrely
will
you
not
describe
that
passage
maskull
answered
slowly
and
thoughtfully
when
i
was
in
matterplay
i
saw
heavy
clouds
discharge
themselves
and
change
to
coloured
living
animals
in
the
same
way
my
black
chaotic
pangs
just
now
seemed
to
consolidate
themselves
and
spring
together
as
a
new
sort
of
joy
the
joy
would
not
have
been
possible
without
the
preliminary
nightmare
it
is
not
accidental
nature
intends
it
so
the
truth
has
just
flashed
through
my
brain
you
men
of
lichstorm
don
t
go
far
enough
you
stop
at
the
pangs
without
realising
that
they
are
birth
if
this
is
true
you
are
a
great
pioneer
muttered
haunte
how
does
this
sensation
differ
from
common
love
interrogated
corpang
this
was
all
that
love
is
multiplied
by
corpang
fingered
his
chin
awhile
the
lichstorm
men
however
will
never
reach
this
stage
for
they
are
too
haunte
turned
pale
why
should
we
alone
suffer
nature
is
freakish
and
cruel
and
doesn
t
act
according
to
justice
follow
us
haunte
and
escape
from
it
i
ll
see
muttered
haunte
perhaps
i
have
we
far
to
go
to
sullenbode
inquired
maskull
no
her
home
s
under
the
hanging
cap
of
what
is
to
happen
tonight
maskull
spoke
to
himself
but
haunte
answered
him
don
t
expect
anything
pleasant
in
spite
of
what
has
just
occurred
she
is
not
a
woman
but
a
mass
of
pure
sex
your
passion
will
draw
her
out
into
human
shape
but
only
for
a
moment
if
the
change
were
permanent
you
would
have
endowed
her
with
a
perhaps
the
change
might
be
made
to
do
that
it
is
not
enough
to
desire
her
she
must
desire
you
as
well
but
why
should
she
desire
you
nothing
turns
out
as
one
expects
said
maskull
shaking
his
head
we
had
better
get
on
they
resumed
the
journey
the
ledge
still
rose
but
on
turning
a
corner
of
the
cliff
haunte
quitted
it
and
began
to
climb
a
steep
gully
which
mounted
directly
to
the
upper
heights
here
they
were
compelled
to
use
both
hands
and
feet
maskull
thought
all
the
while
of
nothing
but
the
overwhelming
sweetness
he
had
just
experienced
the
flat
ground
on
top
was
dry
and
springy
there
was
no
more
snow
and
bright
plants
appeared
haunte
turned
sharply
to
the
left
this
must
be
under
the
cap
said
maskull
it
is
and
within
five
minutes
you
will
see
when
he
spoke
his
words
maskull
s
lips
surprised
him
by
their
tender
sensitiveness
their
action
against
each
other
sent
thrills
throughout
his
body
the
grass
shone
dimly
a
huge
tree
with
glowing
branches
came
into
sight
it
bore
a
multitude
of
red
fruit
like
hanging
lanterns
but
no
leaves
underneath
this
tree
sullenbode
was
sitting
her
beautiful
mingling
of
jale
and
softly
through
the
darkness
she
sat
erect
on
crossed
legs
asleep
she
was
clothed
in
a
singular
skin
garment
which
started
as
a
cloak
thrown
over
one
shoulder
and
ended
as
loose
breeches
terminating
above
the
knees
her
forearms
were
lightly
folded
and
in
one
hand
she
held
a
fruit
maskull
stood
over
her
and
looked
down
deeply
interested
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
half
so
feminine
her
flesh
was
almost
melting
in
its
softness
so
undeveloped
were
the
facial
organs
that
they
looked
scarcely
human
only
the
lips
were
full
pouting
and
expressive
in
their
richness
these
lips
seemed
like
a
splash
of
vivid
will
on
a
background
of
slumbering
protoplasm
her
hair
was
undressed
its
colour
could
not
be
distinguished
it
was
long
and
tangled
and
had
been
tucked
into
her
garment
behind
for
convenience
corpang
looked
calm
and
sullen
but
both
the
others
were
visibly
agitated
maskull
s
heart
was
hammering
away
under
his
chest
haunte
pulled
him
and
said
my
head
feels
as
if
it
were
being
torn
from
my
what
can
that
mean
yet
there
s
a
horrible
joy
in
it
added
haunte
with
a
sickly
smile
he
put
his
hand
on
the
woman
s
shoulder
she
awoke
softly
glanced
up
at
them
smiled
and
then
resumed
eating
her
fruit
maskull
did
not
imagine
that
she
had
intelligence
enough
to
speak
haunte
suddenly
dropped
on
his
knees
and
kissed
her
lips
she
did
not
repulse
him
during
the
continuance
of
the
kiss
maskull
noticed
with
a
shock
that
her
face
was
altering
the
features
emerged
from
their
indistinctness
and
became
human
and
almost
powerful
the
smile
faded
a
scowl
took
its
place
she
thrust
haunte
away
rose
to
her
feet
and
stared
beneath
bent
brows
at
the
three
men
each
one
in
turn
maskull
came
last
his
face
she
studied
for
quite
a
long
time
but
nothing
indicated
what
she
thought
meanwhile
haunte
again
approached
her
staggering
and
grinning
she
suffered
him
quietly
but
the
instant
lips
met
lips
the
second
time
he
fell
backward
with
a
startled
cry
as
though
he
had
come
in
contact
with
an
electric
wire
the
back
of
his
head
struck
the
ground
and
he
lay
there
motionless
corpang
sprang
forward
to
his
assistance
but
when
he
saw
what
had
happened
he
left
him
where
he
was
maskull
come
here
quickly
the
light
was
perceptibly
fading
from
haunte
s
skin
as
maskull
bent
over
the
man
was
dead
his
face
was
unrecognisable
the
head
had
been
split
from
the
top
downward
into
two
halves
streaming
with
coloured
blood
as
though
it
had
received
a
terrible
blow
from
an
axe
this
couldn
t
be
from
the
fall
said
maskull
no
sullenbode
did
maskull
turned
quickly
to
look
at
the
woman
she
had
resumed
her
former
attitude
on
the
ground
the
momentary
intelligence
had
vanished
from
her
face
and
she
was
again
smiling
chapter
sullenbode
sullenbode
s
naked
skin
glowed
softly
through
the
darkness
but
the
clothed
part
of
her
person
was
invisible
maskull
watched
her
senseless
smiling
face
and
shivered
strange
feelings
ran
through
his
body
corpang
spoke
out
of
the
night
she
looks
like
an
evil
spirit
filled
with
it
was
like
deliberately
kissing
haunte
was
insane
with
so
am
i
said
maskull
quietly
my
body
seems
full
of
rocks
all
grinding
against
one
this
is
what
i
was
afraid
it
appears
i
shall
have
to
kiss
her
corpang
pulled
his
arm
have
you
lost
all
manliness
but
maskull
impatiently
shook
himself
free
he
plucked
nervously
at
his
beard
and
stared
at
sullenbode
his
lips
kept
twitching
after
this
had
gone
on
for
a
few
minutes
he
stepped
forward
bent
over
the
woman
and
lifted
her
bodily
in
his
arms
setting
her
upright
against
the
rugged
tree
trunk
he
kissed
her
a
cold
knifelike
shock
passed
down
his
frame
he
thought
that
it
was
death
and
lost
consciousness
when
his
sense
returned
sullenbode
was
holding
him
by
the
shoulder
with
one
hand
at
arm
s
length
searching
his
face
with
gloomy
eyes
at
first
he
failed
to
recognise
her
it
was
not
the
woman
he
had
kissed
but
another
then
he
gradually
realised
that
her
face
was
identical
with
that
which
haunte
s
action
had
called
into
existence
a
great
calmness
came
upon
him
his
bad
sensations
had
disappeared
sullenbode
was
transformed
into
a
living
soul
her
skin
was
firm
her
features
were
strong
her
eyes
gleamed
with
the
consciousness
of
power
she
was
tall
and
slight
but
slow
in
all
her
gestures
and
movements
her
face
was
not
beautiful
it
was
long
and
palely
lighted
while
the
mouth
crossed
the
lower
half
like
a
gash
of
fire
the
lips
were
as
voluptuous
as
before
her
brows
were
heavy
there
was
nothing
vulgar
in
looked
the
kingliest
of
all
women
she
appeared
not
more
than
five
growing
tired
apparently
of
his
scrutiny
she
pushed
him
a
little
way
and
allowed
her
arm
to
drop
at
the
same
time
curving
her
mouth
into
a
long
bowlike
smile
whom
have
i
to
thank
for
this
gift
of
life
her
voice
was
rich
slow
and
odd
maskull
felt
himself
in
a
dream
my
name
is
she
motioned
to
him
to
come
a
step
nearer
listen
maskull
man
after
man
has
drawn
me
into
the
world
but
they
could
not
keep
me
there
for
i
did
not
wish
it
but
now
you
have
drawn
me
into
it
for
all
time
for
good
or
maskull
stretched
a
hand
toward
the
now
invisible
corpse
and
said
quietly
what
have
you
to
say
about
him
who
was
it
so
that
was
haunte
the
news
will
travel
far
and
wide
he
was
a
famous
it
s
a
horrible
affair
i
can
t
think
that
you
killed
him
we
women
are
endowed
with
terrible
power
but
it
is
our
only
protection
we
do
not
want
these
visits
we
loathe
i
might
have
died
you
came
together
there
were
three
of
us
corpang
still
stands
over
i
see
a
faintly
glimmering
form
what
do
you
want
of
me
corpang
then
go
away
and
leave
me
with
no
need
corpang
i
am
coming
with
this
is
not
that
pleasure
then
demanded
the
low
earnest
voice
out
of
the
darkness
no
that
pleasure
has
not
sullenbode
gripped
his
arm
hard
what
pleasure
are
you
speaking
of
a
presentiment
of
love
which
i
felt
not
long
but
what
do
you
feel
now
calm
and
sullenbode
s
face
seemed
like
a
pallid
mask
hiding
a
slow
swelling
sea
of
elemental
passions
i
do
not
know
how
it
will
end
maskull
but
we
will
still
keep
together
a
little
where
are
you
going
to
adage
said
corpang
stepping
forward
but
why
we
are
following
the
steps
of
lodd
who
went
there
years
ago
to
find
what
light
is
that
it
s
the
light
of
another
the
quest
is
grand
but
can
not
women
see
that
light
on
one
condition
said
corpang
they
must
forget
their
sex
womanhood
and
love
belong
to
life
while
muspel
is
above
i
give
you
all
other
men
said
sullenbode
maskull
is
no
i
am
not
here
to
help
maskull
to
a
lover
but
to
remind
him
of
the
existence
of
nobler
you
are
a
good
man
but
you
two
alone
will
never
strike
the
road
to
are
you
acquainted
with
it
again
the
woman
gripped
maskull
s
arm
what
is
corpang
despises
maskull
looked
at
her
attentively
sullenbode
went
on
love
is
that
which
is
perfectly
willing
to
disappear
and
become
nothing
for
the
sake
of
the
corpang
wrinkled
his
forehead
a
magnanimous
female
lover
is
new
in
my
maskull
put
him
aside
with
his
hand
and
said
to
sullenbode
are
you
contemplating
a
sacrifice
she
gazed
at
her
feet
and
smiled
what
does
it
matter
what
my
thoughts
are
tell
me
are
you
starting
at
once
or
do
you
mean
to
rest
first
it
s
a
rough
road
to
what
s
in
your
mind
demanded
maskull
i
will
guide
you
a
little
when
we
reach
the
ridge
between
sarclash
and
adage
perhaps
i
shall
turn
and
then
then
if
the
moon
shines
perhaps
you
will
arrive
before
daybreak
but
if
it
is
dark
it
s
hardly
that
s
not
what
i
meant
what
will
become
of
you
after
we
have
parted
company
i
shall
return
maskull
went
close
up
to
her
in
order
to
study
her
face
better
shall
you
sink
back
old
state
no
maskull
thank
then
how
will
you
live
sullenbode
calmly
removed
the
hand
which
he
had
placed
on
her
arm
there
was
a
sort
of
swirling
flame
in
her
eyes
and
who
said
i
would
go
on
living
maskull
blinked
at
her
in
bewilderment
a
few
moments
passed
before
he
spoke
again
you
women
are
a
sacrificing
lot
you
know
i
can
t
leave
you
like
their
eyes
met
neither
withdrew
them
and
neither
felt
embarrassed
you
will
always
be
the
most
generous
of
men
maskull
now
let
us
go
corpang
is
a
personage
and
the
least
we
aren
t
so
do
is
to
help
him
to
his
destination
we
mustn
t
inquire
whether
the
destination
of
men
is
as
a
rule
worth
arriving
if
it
is
good
for
maskull
it
will
be
good
for
well
no
vessel
can
hold
more
than
its
appointed
corpang
gave
a
wry
smile
during
your
long
sleep
you
appear
to
have
picked
up
yes
corpang
i
have
met
many
men
and
explored
many
as
they
moved
off
maskull
remembered
haunte
can
we
not
bury
that
poor
fellow
by
this
time
tomorrow
we
shall
need
burial
ourselves
but
i
do
not
include
we
have
no
tools
so
you
must
have
your
way
you
killed
him
but
i
am
the
real
murderer
i
stole
his
protecting
surely
that
death
is
balanced
by
the
life
you
have
given
they
left
the
spot
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
by
which
the
three
men
had
arrived
after
a
few
steps
they
came
to
green
snow
again
at
the
same
time
the
flat
ground
ended
and
they
started
to
traverse
a
steep
pathless
mountain
slope
the
snow
and
rocks
glimmered
their
own
bodies
shone
otherwise
everything
was
dark
the
mists
swirled
around
them
but
maskull
had
no
more
nightmares
the
breeze
was
cold
pure
and
steady
they
walked
in
file
sullenbode
leading
her
movements
were
slow
and
fascinating
corpang
came
last
his
stern
eyes
saw
nothing
ahead
but
an
alluring
girl
and
a
man
for
a
long
time
they
continued
crossing
the
rough
and
rocky
slope
maintaining
a
slightly
upward
course
the
angle
was
so
steep
that
a
false
step
would
have
been
fatal
the
high
ground
was
on
their
right
after
a
while
the
hillside
on
the
left
hand
changed
to
level
ground
and
they
seemed
to
have
joined
another
spur
of
the
mountain
the
ascending
slope
on
the
right
hand
persisted
for
a
few
hundred
yards
more
then
sullenbode
bore
sharply
to
the
left
and
they
found
level
ground
all
around
them
we
are
on
the
ridge
announced
the
woman
halting
the
others
came
up
to
her
and
at
the
same
instant
the
moon
burst
through
the
clouds
illuminating
the
whole
scene
maskull
uttered
a
cry
the
wild
noble
lonely
beauty
of
the
view
was
quite
unexpected
teargeld
was
high
in
the
sky
to
their
left
shining
down
on
them
from
behind
straight
in
front
like
an
enormously
wide
smoothly
descending
road
lay
the
great
ridge
which
went
on
to
adage
though
adage
itself
was
out
of
sight
it
was
never
less
than
two
hundred
yards
wide
it
was
covered
with
green
snow
in
some
places
entirely
but
in
other
places
the
naked
rocks
showed
through
like
black
teeth
from
where
they
stood
they
were
unable
to
see
the
sides
of
the
ridge
or
what
lay
underneath
on
the
right
hand
which
was
north
the
landscape
was
blurred
and
indistinct
there
were
no
peaks
there
it
was
the
distant
land
of
barey
but
on
the
left
hand
appeared
a
whole
forest
of
mighty
pinnacles
near
and
far
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
in
moonlight
all
glittered
green
and
all
possessed
the
extraordinary
hanging
caps
that
characterised
the
lichstorm
range
these
caps
were
of
fantastic
shapes
and
each
one
was
different
the
valley
directly
opposite
them
was
filled
with
rolling
mist
sarclash
was
a
mighty
mountain
mass
in
the
shape
of
a
horseshoe
its
two
ends
pointed
west
and
were
separated
from
each
other
by
a
mile
or
more
of
empty
space
the
northern
end
became
the
ridge
on
which
they
stood
the
southern
end
was
the
long
line
of
cliffs
on
that
part
of
the
mountain
where
haunte
s
cave
was
situated
the
connecting
curve
was
the
steep
slope
they
had
just
traversed
one
peak
of
sarclash
was
invisible
in
the
many
mountains
raised
their
heads
in
addition
a
few
summits
which
must
have
been
of
extraordinary
height
appeared
over
the
south
side
of
the
horseshoe
maskull
turned
round
to
put
a
question
to
sullenbode
but
when
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
in
moonlight
the
words
he
had
framed
died
on
his
lips
the
gashlike
mouth
no
longer
dominated
her
other
features
and
the
face
pale
as
ivory
and
most
femininely
shaped
suddenly
became
almost
beautiful
the
lips
were
a
long
womanish
curve
of
her
hair
was
a
dark
maroon
maskull
was
greatly
disturbed
he
thought
that
she
resembled
a
spirit
rather
than
a
woman
what
puzzles
you
she
asked
smiling
nothing
but
i
would
like
to
see
you
by
perhaps
you
never
your
life
must
be
most
she
explored
his
features
with
her
black
eyes
why
do
you
fear
to
speak
your
feelings
maskull
things
seem
to
open
up
before
me
like
a
sunrise
but
what
it
means
i
can
t
sullenbode
laughed
outright
it
assuredly
does
not
mean
the
approach
of
corpang
who
had
been
staring
steadily
along
the
ridge
here
abruptly
broke
in
the
road
is
plain
now
maskull
if
you
wish
it
i
ll
go
on
no
we
ll
go
on
together
sullenbode
will
accompany
a
little
way
said
the
woman
but
not
to
adage
to
pit
my
strength
against
unseen
powers
that
light
is
not
for
me
i
know
how
to
renounce
love
but
i
will
never
be
a
traitor
to
who
knows
what
we
shall
find
on
adage
or
what
will
happen
corpang
is
as
ignorant
as
corpang
looked
him
full
in
the
face
maskull
you
are
quite
well
aware
that
you
never
dare
approach
that
awful
fire
in
the
society
of
a
beautiful
maskull
gave
an
uneasy
laugh
what
corpang
doesn
t
tell
you
sullenbode
is
that
i
am
far
better
acquainted
with
than
he
and
that
but
for
a
chance
meeting
with
me
he
would
still
be
saying
his
prayers
in
still
what
he
says
must
be
true
she
replied
looking
from
one
to
the
other
and
so
i
am
not
to
be
allowed
so
long
as
i
am
with
you
i
shall
urge
you
onward
and
not
backward
we
need
not
quarrel
yet
he
remarked
with
a
forced
smile
no
doubt
things
will
straighten
themselves
sullenbode
began
kicking
the
snow
about
with
her
foot
i
picked
up
another
piece
of
wisdom
in
my
sleep
tell
it
to
me
men
who
live
by
laws
and
rules
are
parasites
others
shed
their
strength
to
bring
these
laws
out
of
nothing
into
the
light
of
day
but
the
live
at
their
have
conquered
nothing
for
it
is
given
to
some
to
discover
and
to
others
to
preserve
and
perfect
you
can
not
condemn
me
for
wishing
maskull
no
but
a
child
can
not
lead
a
they
started
walking
again
along
the
centre
of
the
ridge
all
three
were
abreast
sullenbode
in
the
middle
the
road
descended
by
an
easy
gradient
and
was
for
a
long
distance
comparatively
smooth
the
freezing
point
seemed
higher
than
on
earth
for
the
few
inches
of
snow
through
which
they
trudged
felt
almost
warm
to
their
naked
feet
maskull
s
soles
were
by
now
like
tough
hides
the
moonlit
snow
was
green
and
dazzling
their
slanting
abbreviated
shadows
were
sharply
defined
and
in
colour
maskull
who
walked
on
sullenbode
s
right
hand
looked
constantly
to
the
left
toward
the
galaxy
of
glorious
distant
peaks
you
can
not
belong
to
this
world
said
the
woman
men
of
your
stamp
are
not
to
be
looked
for
no
i
have
come
here
from
is
that
larger
than
our
world
smaller
i
think
small
and
overcrowded
with
men
and
women
with
all
those
people
confusion
would
result
but
for
orderly
laws
and
therefore
the
laws
are
of
iron
as
adventure
would
be
impossible
without
encroaching
on
these
laws
there
is
no
longer
any
spirit
of
adventure
among
the
earthmen
everything
is
safe
vulgar
and
do
men
hate
women
there
and
women
men
no
the
meeting
of
the
sexes
is
sweet
though
shameful
so
poignant
is
the
sweetness
that
the
accompanying
shame
is
ignored
with
open
eyes
there
is
no
hatred
or
only
among
a
few
eccentric
that
shame
surely
must
be
the
rudiment
of
our
lichstorm
passion
but
now
did
you
come
here
to
meet
with
new
experiences
perhaps
the
old
ones
no
longer
interested
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
world
this
is
the
end
of
my
fourth
then
tell
me
what
you
have
seen
and
done
during
those
four
days
you
can
not
have
been
great
misfortunes
have
happened
to
he
proceeded
briefly
to
relate
everything
that
had
taken
place
from
the
moment
of
his
first
awakening
in
the
scarlet
desert
sullenbode
listened
with
eyes
nodding
her
head
from
time
to
time
only
twice
did
she
interrupt
him
after
his
description
of
tydomin
s
death
she
said
speaking
in
a
low
none
of
us
women
ought
by
right
of
nature
to
fall
short
of
tydomin
in
sacrifice
for
that
one
act
of
hers
i
almost
love
her
although
she
brought
evil
to
your
again
speaking
of
gleameil
she
remarked
that
girl
i
admire
the
most
of
all
she
listened
to
her
inner
voice
and
to
nothing
else
besides
which
of
us
others
is
strong
enough
for
that
when
his
tale
was
quite
over
sullenbode
said
does
it
not
strike
you
maskull
that
these
women
you
have
met
have
been
far
nobler
than
the
men
i
recognise
that
we
men
often
sacrifice
ourselves
but
only
for
a
substantial
cause
for
you
women
almost
any
cause
will
serve
you
love
the
sacrifice
for
its
own
sake
and
that
is
because
you
are
naturally
turning
her
head
a
little
she
threw
him
a
smile
so
proud
yet
so
sweet
that
he
was
struck
into
silence
they
tramped
on
quietly
for
some
distance
and
then
he
said
now
you
understand
the
sort
of
man
i
am
much
brutality
more
weakness
scant
pity
for
it
has
been
a
bloody
journey
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
for
one
would
not
have
it
less
nothing
good
can
be
said
of
my
to
me
you
seem
like
a
lonely
giant
searching
for
you
know
not
what
the
grandest
that
life
holds
you
at
least
have
no
cause
to
look
up
to
thanks
sullenbode
he
responded
with
a
troubled
smile
when
maskull
passes
let
people
watch
everyone
is
thrown
out
of
your
road
you
go
on
looking
neither
to
right
nor
take
care
that
you
are
not
thrown
as

maskull
shall
do
with
me
whatever
he
pleases
old
skull
and
for
whatever
he
does
i
will
thank
him
in
place
of
a
heart
you
have
a
bag
of
loose
dust
someone
has
described
love
to
you
you
have
had
it
described
to
you
you
have
heard
that
it
is
a
small
fearful
selfish
joy
it
is
not
is
wild
and
scornful
and
sportive
and
bloody
how
should
you
selfishness
has
far
too
many
if
a
woman
wills
to
give
up
all
what
can
there
be
selfish
in
that
only
do
not
deceive
yourself
act
decisively
or
fate
will
be
too
swift
for
you
sullenbode
studied
him
through
her
lashes
do
you
mean
death
as
well
as
mine
you
go
too
far
corpang
said
maskull
turning
a
shade
darker
i
don
t
accept
you
as
the
arbiter
of
our
if
honest
counsel
is
disagreeable
to
you
let
me
go
on
the
woman
detained
him
with
her
slow
light
fingers
i
wish
you
to
stay
with
why
i
think
you
may
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
don
t
wish
to
bring
harm
to
maskull
presently
i
ll
leave
that
will
be
best
said
corpang
maskull
looked
angry
i
shall
whether
you
go
on
or
back
i
stay
with
you
my
mind
is
made
an
expression
of
joyousness
overspread
her
face
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
conceal
it
why
do
you
scowl
at
me
maskull
he
returned
no
answer
but
continued
walking
onward
with
puckered
brows
after
a
dozen
paces
or
so
he
halted
abruptly
wait
sullenbode
the
others
came
to
a
standstill
corpang
looked
puzzled
but
the
woman
smiled
maskull
without
a
word
bent
over
and
kissed
her
lips
then
he
relinquished
her
body
and
turned
around
to
corpang
how
do
you
in
your
great
wisdom
interpret
that
kiss
it
requires
no
great
wisdom
to
interpret
kisses
hereafter
never
dare
to
come
between
us
sullenbode
belongs
to
then
i
say
no
more
but
you
are
a
fated
from
that
time
forward
he
spoke
not
another
word
to
either
of
the
others
a
heavy
gleam
appeared
in
the
woman
s
eyes
now
things
are
changed
maskull
where
are
you
taking
me
choose
the
man
i
love
must
complete
his
journey
i
won
t
have
it
otherwise
you
shall
not
stand
lower
than
where
you
go
i
will
and
long
as
your
love
endures
i
will
accompany
to
do
you
doubt
its
lasting
i
wish
not
to
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
refused
to
tell
you
before
the
term
of
your
love
is
the
term
of
my
life
when
you
love
me
no
longer
i
must
and
why
asked
maskull
slowly
yes
that
s
the
responsibility
you
incurred
when
you
kissed
me
for
the
first
time
i
never
meant
to
tell
do
you
mean
that
if
i
had
gone
on
alone
you
would
have
died
i
have
no
other
life
but
what
you
give
he
gazed
at
her
mournfully
without
attempting
to
reply
and
then
slowly
placed
his
arms
around
her
body
during
this
embrace
he
turned
very
pale
but
sullenbode
grew
as
white
as
chalk
a
few
minutes
later
the
journey
toward
adage
was
resumed
they
had
been
walking
for
two
hours
teargeld
was
higher
in
the
sky
and
nearer
the
south
they
had
descended
many
hundred
feet
and
the
character
of
the
ridge
began
to
alter
for
the
worse
the
thin
snow
disappeared
and
gave
way
to
moist
boggy
ground
it
was
all
little
grassy
hillocks
and
marshes
they
began
to
slip
about
and
become
draggled
with
mud
conversation
ceased
sullenbode
led
the
way
and
the
men
followed
in
her
tracks
the
southern
half
of
the
landscape
grew
grander
the
greenish
light
of
the
brilliant
moon
shining
on
the
multitude
of
peaks
caused
it
to
appear
like
a
spectral
world
their
nearest
neighbour
towered
high
above
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
due
south
some
five
miles
distant
it
was
a
slender
inaccessible
dizzy
spire
of
black
rock
the
angles
of
which
were
too
steep
to
retain
snow
a
great
horn
of
rock
sprang
out
from
its
topmost
pinnacle
for
a
long
time
it
constituted
their
cheif
landmark
the
whole
ridge
gradually
became
saturated
with
moisture
the
surface
soil
was
spongy
and
rested
on
impermeable
rock
it
breathed
in
the
damp
mists
by
night
and
breathed
them
out
again
by
day
under
branchspell
s
rays
the
walking
grew
first
unpleasant
then
difficult
and
finally
dangerous
none
of
the
party
could
distinguish
firm
ground
from
bog
sullenbode
sank
up
to
her
waist
in
a
pit
of
slime
maskull
rescued
her
but
after
this
incident
took
the
lead
himself
corpang
was
the
next
to
meet
with
trouble
exploring
a
new
path
for
himself
he
tumbled
into
liquid
mud
up
to
his
shoulders
and
narrowly
escaped
a
filthy
death
after
maskull
had
got
him
out
at
great
personal
risk
they
proceeded
once
more
but
now
the
scramble
changed
from
bad
to
worse
each
step
had
to
be
thoroughly
tested
before
weight
was
put
upon
it
and
even
so
the
test
frequently
failed
all
of
them
went
in
so
often
that
in
the
end
they
no
longer
resembled
human
beings
but
walking
pillars
plastered
from
top
to
toe
with
black
filth
the
hardest
work
fell
to
maskull
he
not
only
had
the
exhausting
task
of
beating
the
way
but
was
continually
called
upon
to
help
his
companions
out
of
their
difficulties
without
him
they
could
not
have
got
through
after
a
peculiarly
evil
patch
they
paused
to
recruit
their
strength
corpang
s
breathing
was
difficult
sullenbode
was
quiet
listless
and
depressed
maskull
gazed
at
them
doubtfully
does
this
continue
he
inquired
no
i
think
replied
the
woman
we
can
t
be
far
from
the
mornstab
pass
after
that
we
shall
begin
to
climb
again
and
then
the
road
will
improve
can
you
have
been
here
before
once
i
have
been
to
the
pass
but
it
was
not
so
bad
you
are
tired
out
what
of
it
she
replied
smiling
faintly
when
one
has
a
terrible
lover
one
must
pay
the
we
can
not
get
there
tonight
so
let
us
stop
at
the
first
shelter
we
come
i
leave
it
to
he
paced
up
and
down
while
the
others
sat
do
you
regret
anything
he
demanded
suddenly
no
maskull
nothing
i
regret
your
feelings
are
unchanged
love
can
t
go
can
only
go
yes
eternally
on
it
is
no
i
don
t
mean
that
there
is
a
climax
but
when
the
climax
has
been
reached
love
if
it
still
wants
to
ascend
must
turn
to
that
s
a
dreadful
creed
he
said
in
a
low
voice
turning
pale
beneath
his
coating
of
mud
perhaps
my
nature
is
discordant
i
am
tired
i
don
t
know
what
i
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
on
their
feet
again
and
the
journey
recommenced
within
half
an
hour
they
had
reached
the
mornstab
pass
the
ground
here
was
drier
the
broken
land
to
the
north
served
to
drain
off
the
moisture
of
the
soil
sullenbode
led
them
to
the
northern
edge
of
the
ridge
to
show
them
the
nature
of
the
country
the
pass
was
nothing
but
a
gigantic
landslip
on
both
sides
of
the
ridge
where
it
was
the
lowest
above
the
underlying
land
a
series
of
huge
broken
terraces
of
earth
and
rock
descended
toward
barey
they
were
overgrown
with
stunted
vegetation
it
was
quite
possible
to
get
down
to
the
lowlands
that
way
but
rather
difficult
on
either
side
of
the
landslip
to
east
and
west
the
ridge
came
down
in
a
long
line
of
sheer
terrific
cliffs
a
low
haze
concealed
barey
from
view
complete
stillness
was
in
the
air
broken
only
by
the
distant
thundering
of
an
invisible
waterfall
maskull
and
sullenbode
sat
down
on
a
boulder
facing
the
open
country
the
moon
was
directly
behind
them
high
up
it
was
almost
as
light
as
an
earth
day
tonight
is
like
life
said
sullenbode
how
so
so
lovely
above
and
around
us
so
foul
maskull
sighed
poor
girl
you
are
and
you
happy
he
thought
a
while
and
then
no
no
i
m
not
happy
love
is
not
what
is
it
maskull
too
grand
for
our
soul
to
think
yes
said
sullenbode
after
a
time
she
asked
why
were
we
created
just
to
live
for
a
few
years
and
then
disappear
we
are
told
that
we
shall
live
yes
maskull
perhaps
in
muspel
he
added
thoughtfully
what
kind
of
life
will
that
be
surely
we
shall
meet
again
love
is
too
wonderful
and
mysterious
a
thing
to
remain
she
gave
a
slight
shiver
and
turned
away
from
him
this
dream
is
untrue
love
is
completed
how
can
that
be
when
sooner
or
later
it
is
brutally
interrupted
by
fate
it
is
completed
by
anguish
oh
why
must
it
always
be
enjoyment
for
us
can
t
we
t
we
go
on
suffering
forever
and
ever
maskull
until
love
crushes
our
spirit
finally
and
without
remedy
we
don
t
begin
to
feel
maskull
gazed
at
her
with
a
troubled
expression
can
the
memory
of
love
be
worth
more
than
its
presence
and
reality
you
don
t
understand
those
pangs
are
more
precious
than
all
the
rest
she
caught
at
him
oh
if
you
could
only
see
inside
my
mind
maskull
you
would
see
strange
things
i
can
t
explain
it
is
all
confused
even
to
myself
this
love
is
quite
different
from
what
i
he
sighed
again
love
is
a
strong
drink
perhaps
it
is
too
strong
for
human
beings
and
i
think
that
it
overturns
our
reason
in
different
they
remained
sitting
side
by
side
staring
straight
before
them
with
unseeing
eyes
it
doesn
t
matter
said
sullenbode
at
last
with
a
smile
getting
up
soon
it
will
be
ended
one
way
or
another
come
let
us
be
off
maskull
too
got
up
where
s
corpang
he
asked
listlessly
they
both
looked
across
the
ridge
in
the
direction
of
adage
at
the
point
where
they
stood
it
was
nearly
a
mile
wide
it
sloped
perceptibly
toward
the
southern
edge
giving
all
the
earth
the
appearance
of
a
heavy
list
toward
the
west
the
ground
continued
level
for
a
thousand
yards
but
then
a
high
sloping
grassy
hill
went
right
across
the
ridge
from
side
to
side
like
a
vast
billow
on
the
verge
of
breaking
it
shut
out
all
further
view
beyond
the
whole
crest
of
this
hill
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
crowned
by
a
long
row
of
enormous
stone
posts
shining
brightly
in
the
moonlight
against
a
background
of
dark
sky
there
were
about
thirty
in
all
and
they
were
placed
at
such
regular
intervals
that
there
was
little
doubt
that
they
had
been
set
there
by
human
hands
some
were
perpendicular
but
others
dipped
so
much
that
an
aspect
of
extreme
antiquity
was
given
to
the
entire
colonnade
corpang
was
seen
climbing
the
hill
not
far
from
the
top
he
wishes
to
arrive
said
maskull
watching
the
energetic
ascent
with
a
rather
cynical
smile
the
heavens
won
t
open
for
corpang
returned
sullenbode
he
need
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
what
do
these
pillars
seem
like
to
you
they
might
be
the
entrance
to
some
mighty
temple
who
can
have
planted
them
there
she
did
not
answer
they
watched
corpang
gain
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
disappear
through
the
line
of
posts
maskull
turned
again
to
sullenbode
now
we
two
are
alone
in
a
lonely
she
regarded
him
steadily
our
last
night
on
this
earth
must
be
a
grand
one
i
am
ready
to
go
i
don
t
think
you
are
fit
to
go
on
it
will
be
better
to
go
down
the
pass
a
little
and
find
she
half
smiled
we
won
t
study
our
poor
bodies
tonight
i
mean
you
to
go
to
adage
then
at
all
events
let
us
rest
first
for
it
must
be
a
long
terrible
climb
and
who
knows
what
hardships
we
shall
meet
she
walked
a
step
or
two
forward
half
turned
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
come
maskull
when
they
had
covered
half
the
distance
that
separated
them
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
maskull
heard
the
drum
taps
they
came
from
behind
the
hill
and
were
loud
sharp
almost
explosive
he
glanced
at
sullenbode
but
she
appeared
to
hear
nothing
a
minute
later
the
whole
sky
behind
and
above
the
long
chain
of
stone
posts
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
began
to
be
illuminated
by
a
strange
radiance
the
moonlight
in
that
quarter
faded
the
posts
stood
out
black
on
a
background
of
fire
it
was
the
light
of
muspel
as
the
moments
passed
it
grew
more
and
more
vivid
peculiar
and
awful
it
was
of
no
colour
and
resembled
was
supernatural
and
indescribable
maskull
s
spirit
swelled
he
stood
fast
with
expanded
nostrils
and
terrible
eyes
sullenbode
touched
him
lightly
what
do
you
see
maskull
i
see
the
light
shot
up
until
maskull
scarcely
knew
where
he
stood
it
burned
with
a
fiercer
and
stranger
glare
than
ever
before
he
forgot
the
existence
of
sullenbode
the
drum
beats
grew
deafeningly
loud
each
beat
was
like
a
rip
of
startling
thunder
crashing
through
the
sky
and
making
the
air
tremble
presently
the
crashes
coalesced
and
one
continuous
roar
of
thunder
rocked
the
world
but
the
rhythm
four
beats
with
the
third
accented
still
came
pulsing
through
the
atmosphere
only
now
against
a
background
of
thunder
and
not
of
silence
maskull
s
heart
beat
wildly
his
body
was
like
a
prison
he
longed
to
throw
it
off
to
spring
up
and
become
incorporated
with
the
sublime
universe
which
was
beginning
to
unveil
itself
sullenbode
suddenly
enfolded
him
in
her
arms
and
kissed
again
and
again
he
made
no
response
he
was
unaware
of
what
she
was
doing
she
unclasped
him
and
with
bent
head
and
streaming
eyes
went
noiselessly
away
she
started
to
go
back
toward
the
mornstab
pass
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
radiance
began
to
fade
the
thunder
died
down
the
moonlight
reappeared
the
stone
posts
and
the
hillside
were
again
bright
in
a
short
time
the
supernatural
light
had
entirely
vanished
but
the
drum
taps
still
sounded
faintly
a
muffled
rhythm
from
behind
the
hill
maskull
started
violently
and
stared
around
him
like
a
suddenly
awakened
sleeper
he
saw
sullenbode
walking
slowly
away
from
him
a
few
hundred
yards
off
at
that
sight
death
entered
his
heart
he
ran
after
her
calling
out
she
did
not
look
around
when
he
had
lessened
the
distance
between
them
by
a
half
he
saw
her
suddenly
stumble
and
fall
she
did
not
get
up
again
but
lay
motionless
where
she
fell
he
flew
toward
her
and
bent
over
her
body
his
worst
fears
were
realised
life
had
departed
beneath
its
coating
of
mud
her
face
bore
the
vulgar
ghastly
crystalman
grin
but
maskull
saw
nothing
of
it
she
had
never
appeared
so
beautiful
to
him
as
at
that
moment
he
remained
beside
her
for
a
long
time
on
his
knees
he
between
his
fits
of
weeping
he
raised
his
head
from
time
to
time
and
listened
to
the
distant
drum
beats
an
hour
hours
teargeld
was
now
in
the
maskull
lifted
sullenbode
s
dead
body
on
to
his
shoulders
and
started
to
walk
toward
the
pass
he
cared
no
more
for
muspel
he
intended
to
look
for
water
in
which
to
wash
the
corpse
of
his
beloved
and
earth
in
which
to
bury
her
when
he
had
reached
the
boulder
overlooking
the
landslip
on
which
they
had
sat
together
he
lowered
his
burden
and
placing
the
dead
girl
on
the
stone
seated
himself
beside
her
for
a
time
gazing
over
toward
barey
after
that
he
commenced
his
descent
of
the
mornstab
pass
chapter
barey
the
day
had
already
dawned
but
it
was
not
yet
sunrise
when
maskull
awoke
from
his
miserable
sleep
he
sat
up
and
yawned
feebly
the
air
was
cool
and
sweet
far
away
down
the
landslip
a
bird
was
singing
the
song
consisted
of
only
two
notes
but
it
was
so
plaintive
and
heartbreaking
that
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
endure
it
the
eastern
sky
was
a
delicate
green
crossed
by
a
long
thin
band
of
cloud
near
the
horizon
the
atmosphere
was
tinted
mysterious
and
hazy
neither
sarclash
nor
adage
was
visible
the
saddle
of
the
pass
was
five
hundred
feet
above
him
he
had
descended
that
distance
overnight
the
landslip
continued
downward
like
a
huge
flying
staircase
to
the
upper
slopes
of
barey
which
lay
perhaps
fifteen
hundred
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
pass
was
rough
and
the
angle
was
excessively
steep
though
not
precipitous
it
was
above
a
mile
across
on
each
side
of
it
east
and
west
the
dark
walls
of
the
ridge
descended
sheer
at
the
point
where
the
pass
sprang
outward
they
were
two
thousand
feet
from
top
to
bottom
but
as
the
ridge
went
upward
on
the
one
hand
toward
adage
on
the
other
toward
sarclash
they
attained
almost
unbelievable
heights
despite
the
great
breadth
and
solidity
of
the
pass
maskull
felt
as
though
he
were
suspended
in
midair
the
patch
of
broken
rich
brown
soil
observable
not
far
away
marked
sullenbode
s
grave
he
had
interred
her
by
the
light
of
the
moon
with
a
long
flat
stone
for
a
spade
a
little
lower
down
the
white
steam
of
a
hot
spring
was
curling
about
in
the
twilight
from
where
he
sat
he
was
unable
to
see
the
pool
into
which
the
spring
ultimately
flowed
but
it
was
in
that
pool
that
he
had
last
night
washed
first
of
all
the
dead
girl
s
body
and
then
his
own
he
got
up
yawned
again
stretched
himself
and
looked
around
him
dully
for
a
long
time
he
eyed
the
grave
the
changed
by
imperceptible
degrees
to
full
day
the
sun
was
about
to
appear
the
sky
was
nearly
cloudless
the
whole
wonderful
extent
of
the
mighty
ridge
behind
him
began
to
emerge
from
the
morning
mist
there
was
a
part
of
sarclash
and
the
crest
of
gigantic
adage
itself
which
he
could
only
take
in
by
throwing
his
head
right
back
he
gazed
at
everything
in
weary
apathy
like
a
lost
soul
all
his
desires
were
gone
forever
he
wished
to
go
nowhere
and
to
do
nothing
he
thought
he
would
go
to
barey
he
went
to
the
warm
pool
to
wash
the
sleep
out
of
his
eyes
sitting
beside
it
watching
the
bubbles
was
krag
maskull
thought
that
he
was
dreaming
the
man
was
clothed
in
a
skin
shirt
and
breeches
his
face
was
stern
yellow
and
ugly
he
eyed
maskull
without
smiling
or
getting
up
where
in
the
devil
s
name
have
you
come
from
krag
the
great
point
is
i
am
where
s
nightspore
not
far
it
seems
a
hundred
years
since
i
saw
you
why
did
you
two
leave
me
in
such
a
damnable
fashion
you
were
strong
enough
to
get
through
so
it
turned
out
but
how
were
you
to
know
anyway
you
ve
timed
it
well
it
seems
i
am
to
die
krag
scowled
you
will
die
this
if
i
am
to
i
shall
but
where
have
you
heard
it
from
you
are
ripe
for
it
you
have
run
through
the
gamut
what
else
is
there
to
live
for
nothing
said
maskull
uttering
a
short
laugh
i
am
quite
ready
i
have
failed
in
everything
i
only
wondered
how
you
knew
so
now
you
ve
come
to
rejoin
me
where
are
we
going
through
and
what
about
nightspore
krag
jumped
to
his
feet
with
clumsy
agility
we
won
t
wait
for
him
he
ll
be
there
as
soon
as
we
where
at
our
destination
come
the
sun
s
as
they
started
clambering
down
the
pass
side
by
side
branchspell
huge
and
white
leaped
fiercely
into
the
sky
all
the
delicacy
of
the
dawn
vanished
and
another
vulgar
day
began
they
passed
some
trees
and
plants
the
leaves
of
which
were
all
curled
up
as
if
in
sleep
maskull
pointed
them
out
to
his
companion
how
is
it
the
sunshine
doesn
t
open
them
branchspell
is
a
second
night
to
them
their
day
is
how
long
will
it
be
before
that
sun
rises
some
time
shall
i
live
to
see
it
do
you
think
do
you
want
to
at
one
time
i
did
but
now
i
m
keep
in
that
humour
and
you
ll
do
well
once
for
all
there
s
nothing
worth
seeing
on
after
a
few
minutes
maskull
said
why
did
we
come
here
then
to
follow
true
but
where
is
he
closer
at
hand
than
you
think
do
you
know
that
he
is
regarded
as
a
god
here
krag
there
is
supernatural
fire
too
which
i
have
been
led
to
believe
is
somehow
connected
with
him
why
do
you
keep
up
the
mystery
who
and
what
is
surtur
don
t
disturb
yourself
about
that
you
will
never
do
you
know
i
know
snarled
krag
the
devil
here
is
called
krag
went
on
maskull
peering
into
his
face
as
long
as
pleasure
is
worshiped
krag
will
always
be
the
here
we
are
talking
face
to
face
two
men
together
what
am
i
to
believe
of
you
believe
your
senses
the
real
devil
is
they
continued
descending
the
landslip
the
sun
s
rays
had
grown
insufferably
hot
in
front
of
them
down
below
in
the
far
distance
maskull
saw
water
and
land
intermingled
it
appeared
that
they
were
travelling
toward
a
lake
district
what
have
you
and
nightspore
been
doing
during
the
last
four
days
krag
what
happened
to
the
torpedo
you
re
just
about
on
the
same
mental
level
as
a
man
who
sees
a
new
palace
and
asks
what
has
become
of
the
what
palace
have
you
been
building
then
we
have
not
been
idle
said
krag
while
you
have
been
murdering
and
lovemaking
we
have
had
our
and
how
have
you
been
made
acquainted
with
my
actions
oh
you
re
an
open
book
now
you
ve
got
a
mortal
heart
wound
on
account
of
a
woman
you
knew
for
six
maskull
turned
pale
sneer
away
krag
if
you
lived
with
a
woman
for
six
hundred
years
and
saw
her
die
that
would
never
touch
your
leather
heart
you
haven
t
even
the
feelings
of
an
behold
the
child
defending
its
toys
said
krag
grinning
faintly
maskull
stopped
short
what
do
you
want
with
me
and
why
did
you
bring
me
here
it
s
no
use
stopping
even
for
the
sake
of
theatrical
effect
said
krag
pulling
him
into
motion
again
the
distance
has
got
to
be
covered
however
often
we
pull
when
he
touched
him
maskull
felt
a
terrible
shooting
pain
through
his
heart
i
can
t
go
on
regarding
you
as
a
man
krag
you
re
something
more
than
a
good
or
evil
i
can
t
krag
looked
yellow
and
formidable
he
did
not
reply
to
maskull
s
remark
but
after
a
pause
said
so
you
ve
been
trying
to
find
surtur
on
your
own
account
during
the
intervals
between
killing
and
fondling
what
was
that
drumming
demanded
maskull
you
needn
t
look
so
important
we
know
you
had
your
ear
to
the
keyhole
but
you
could
join
the
assembly
the
music
was
not
playing
for
you
my
maskull
smiled
rather
bitterly
at
all
events
i
listen
through
no
more
keyholes
i
have
finished
with
life
i
belong
to
nobody
and
nothing
any
more
from
this
time
brave
words
brave
words
we
shall
see
perhaps
crystalman
will
make
one
more
attempt
on
you
there
is
still
time
for
one
now
i
don
t
understand
you
think
you
are
thoroughly
disillusioned
don
t
you
well
that
may
prove
to
be
the
last
and
strongest
illusion
of
the
conversation
ceased
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
landslip
an
hour
later
branchspell
was
steadily
mounting
the
cloudless
sky
it
was
approaching
sarclash
and
it
was
an
open
question
whether
or
not
it
would
clear
its
peak
the
heat
was
sweltering
the
long
massive
ridge
behind
them
with
its
terrific
precipices
was
glowing
with
bright
morning
colours
adage
towering
up
many
thousands
of
feet
higher
still
guarded
the
end
of
it
like
a
lonely
colossus
in
front
of
them
starting
from
where
they
stood
was
a
cool
and
enchanting
wilderness
of
little
lakes
and
forests
the
water
of
the
lakes
was
dark
green
the
forests
were
asleep
waiting
for
the
rising
of
alppain
are
we
now
in
barey
asked
maskull
there
is
one
of
the
there
was
an
ugly
glint
in
his
eye
as
he
spoke
the
words
but
maskull
did
not
see
it
a
man
was
leaning
in
the
shade
against
one
of
the
first
trees
apparently
waiting
for
them
to
come
up
he
was
small
dark
and
beardless
and
was
still
in
early
manhood
he
was
clothed
in
a
dark
blue
loosely
flowing
robe
and
wore
a
slouch
hat
his
face
which
was
not
disfigured
by
any
special
organs
was
pale
earnest
and
grave
yet
somehow
remarkably
pleasing
before
a
word
was
spoken
he
warmly
grasped
maskull
s
hand
but
even
while
he
was
in
the
act
of
doing
so
he
threw
a
queer
frown
at
krag
the
latter
responded
with
a
scowling
grin
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
his
voice
was
a
vibrating
baritone
but
it
was
at
the
same
time
strangely
womanish
in
its
modulations
and
variety
of
tone
i
ve
been
waiting
for
you
here
since
sunrise
he
said
welcome
to
barey
maskull
let
s
hope
you
ll
forget
your
sorrows
here
you
tested
maskull
stared
at
him
not
without
friendliness
what
made
you
expect
me
and
how
do
you
know
my
name
the
stranger
smiled
which
made
his
face
very
handsome
i
m
gangnet
i
know
most
haven
t
you
a
greeting
for
me
asked
krag
thrusting
his
forbidding
features
almost
into
the
other
s
face
i
know
you
krag
there
are
few
places
where
you
are
and
i
know
you
well
we
are
here
together
and
you
must
make
what
you
can
of
it
we
are
going
down
to
the
the
smile
faded
from
gangnet
s
face
i
can
t
drive
you
away
i
can
make
you
the
unwelcome
krag
threw
back
his
head
and
gave
a
loud
grating
laugh
that
bargain
suits
me
all
right
as
long
as
i
have
the
substance
you
may
have
the
shadow
and
much
good
may
it
do
now
that
it
s
all
arranged
so
satisfactorily
said
maskull
with
a
hard
smile
permit
me
to
say
that
i
don
t
desire
any
society
at
all
at
present
you
take
too
much
for
granted
krag
you
have
played
the
false
friend
once
already
i
presume
i
m
a
free
agent
to
be
a
free
man
one
must
have
a
universe
of
one
s
own
said
krag
with
a
jeering
look
what
do
you
say
this
a
free
world
freedom
from
pain
and
ugliness
should
be
every
man
s
privilege
returned
gangnet
tranquilly
maskull
is
quite
within
his
rights
and
if
you
ll
engage
to
leave
him
i
ll
do
the
maskull
can
change
face
as
often
as
he
likes
but
he
won
t
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
be
easy
on
that
point
it
doesn
t
matter
muttered
maskull
let
everyone
join
in
the
procession
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
finally
be
free
anyhow
if
what
they
say
is
i
ll
lead
the
way
said
gangnet
you
don
t
know
this
country
of
course
maskull
when
we
get
to
the
flat
lands
some
miles
farther
down
we
shall
be
able
to
travel
by
water
but
at
present
we
must
walk
i
yes
you
fear
broke
out
krag
in
a
highpitched
scraping
voice
you
eternal
loller
maskull
kept
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
amazement
there
seemed
to
be
a
determined
hostility
between
the
two
which
indicated
an
intimate
previous
acquaintance
they
set
off
through
a
wood
keeping
close
to
its
border
so
that
for
a
mile
or
more
they
were
within
sight
of
the
long
narrow
lake
that
flowed
beside
it
the
trees
were
low
and
thin
their
leaves
were
all
folded
there
was
no
walked
on
clean
brown
earth
a
distant
waterfall
sounded
they
were
in
shade
but
the
air
was
pleasantly
warm
there
were
no
insects
to
irritate
them
the
bright
lake
outside
looked
cool
and
poetic
gangnet
pressed
maskull
s
arm
affectionately
if
the
bringing
of
you
from
your
world
had
fallen
to
me
maskull
it
is
here
i
would
have
brought
you
and
not
to
the
scarlet
desert
then
you
would
have
escaped
the
dark
spots
and
tormance
would
have
appeared
beautiful
to
and
what
then
gangnet
the
dark
spots
would
have
existed
all
the
you
could
have
seen
them
afterward
it
makes
all
the
difference
whether
one
sees
darkness
through
the
light
or
brightness
through
the
a
clear
eye
is
the
best
tormance
is
an
ugly
world
and
i
greatly
prefer
to
know
it
as
it
really
the
devil
made
it
ugly
not
crystalman
these
are
crystalman
s
thoughts
which
you
see
around
you
he
is
nothing
but
beauty
and
pleasantness
even
krag
won
t
have
the
effrontery
to
deny
it
s
very
nice
here
said
krag
looking
around
him
malignantly
one
only
wants
a
cushion
and
half
a
dozen
houris
to
complete
maskull
disengaged
himself
from
gangnet
last
night
when
i
was
struggling
through
the
mud
in
the
ghastly
i
thought
the
world
poor
sullenbode
said
gangnet
sighing
what
you
knew
her
i
know
her
through
you
by
mourning
for
a
noble
woman
you
show
your
own
nobility
i
think
all
women
are
there
may
be
millions
of
noble
women
but
there
s
only
one
if
sullenbode
can
exist
said
gangnet
the
world
can
not
be
a
bad
change
the
subject
the
world
s
hard
and
cruel
and
i
am
thankful
to
be
leaving
on
one
point
though
you
both
agree
said
krag
smiling
evilly
pleasure
is
good
and
the
cessation
of
pleasure
is
gangnet
glanced
at
him
coldly
we
know
your
peculiar
theories
krag
you
are
very
fond
of
them
but
they
are
unworkable
the
world
could
not
go
on
being
without
so
gangnet
thinks
jeered
krag
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
wood
and
found
themselves
overlooking
a
little
cliff
at
the
foot
of
it
about
fifty
feet
below
a
fresh
series
of
lakes
and
forests
commenced
barey
appeared
to
be
one
big
mountain
slope
built
by
nature
into
terraces
the
lake
along
whose
border
they
had
been
travelling
was
not
banked
at
the
end
but
overflowed
to
the
lower
level
in
half
a
dozen
beautiful
threadlike
falls
white
and
throwing
off
spray
the
cliff
was
not
perpendicular
and
the
men
found
it
easy
to
negotiate
at
the
base
they
entered
another
wood
here
it
was
much
denser
and
they
had
nothing
but
trees
all
around
them
a
clear
brook
rippled
through
the
heart
of
it
they
followed
its
bank
it
has
occurred
to
me
said
maskull
addressing
gangnet
that
alppain
may
be
my
death
is
that
so
these
trees
don
t
fear
alppain
so
why
should
you
alppain
is
a
wonderful
the
reason
i
ask
ve
seen
its
afterglow
and
it
produced
such
violent
sensations
that
a
very
little
more
would
have
proved
too
because
the
forces
were
evenly
balanced
when
you
see
alppain
itself
it
will
reign
supreme
and
there
will
be
no
more
struggling
of
wills
inside
and
that
i
may
tell
you
beforehand
maskull
said
krag
grinning
is
crystalman
s
trump
how
do
you
mean
you
ll
see
you
ll
renounce
the
world
so
eagerly
that
you
ll
want
to
stay
in
the
world
merely
to
enjoy
your
gangnet
smiled
krag
you
see
is
hard
to
please
you
must
neither
enjoy
nor
renounce
what
are
you
to
do
maskull
turned
toward
krag
it
s
very
odd
but
i
don
t
understand
your
creed
even
yet
are
you
recommending
suicide
krag
seemed
to
grow
sallower
and
more
repulsive
every
minute
what
because
they
have
left
off
stroking
you
he
exclaimed
laughing
and
showing
his
discoloured
teeth
whoever
you
are
and
whatever
you
want
said
maskull
you
seem
very
certain
of
yes
you
would
like
me
to
blush
and
stammer
like
a
booby
wouldn
t
you
that
would
be
an
excellent
way
of
destroying
gangnet
glanced
toward
the
foot
of
one
of
the
trees
he
stooped
and
picked
up
two
or
three
objects
that
resembled
eggs
to
eat
asked
maskull
accepting
the
offered
gift
yes
eat
them
you
must
be
hungry
i
want
none
myself
and
one
mustn
t
insult
krag
by
offering
him
a
such
a
low
maskull
knocked
the
ends
off
two
of
the
eggs
and
swallowed
the
liquid
contents
they
tasted
rather
alcoholic
krag
snatched
the
remaining
egg
out
of
his
hand
and
flung
it
against
a
tree
trunk
where
it
broke
and
stuck
a
splash
of
slime
i
don
t
wait
to
be
asked
gangnet
say
is
there
a
filthier
sight
than
a
smashed
pleasure
gangnet
did
not
reply
but
took
maskull
s
arm
after
they
had
alternately
walked
through
forests
and
descended
cliffs
and
slopes
for
upward
of
two
hours
the
landscape
altered
a
steep
mountainside
commenced
and
continued
for
at
least
a
couple
of
miles
during
which
space
the
land
must
have
dropped
nearly
four
thousand
feet
at
a
practically
uniform
gradient
maskull
had
seen
nothing
like
this
immense
slide
of
country
anywhere
the
hill
slope
carried
an
enormous
forest
on
its
back
this
forest
however
was
different
from
those
they
had
hitherto
passed
through
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
curled
in
sleep
but
the
boughs
were
so
close
and
numerous
that
but
for
the
fact
that
they
were
translucent
the
rays
of
the
sun
would
have
been
completely
intercepted
as
it
was
the
whole
forest
was
flooded
with
light
and
this
light
being
tinged
with
the
colour
of
the
branches
was
a
soft
and
lovely
rose
so
gay
feminine
and
dawnlike
was
the
illumination
that
maskull
s
spirits
immediately
started
to
rise
although
he
did
not
wish
it
he
checked
himself
sighed
and
grew
pensive
what
a
place
for
languishing
eyes
and
necks
of
ivory
maskull
rasped
krag
mockingly
why
isn
t
sullenbode
here
maskull
gripped
him
roughly
and
flung
him
against
the
nearest
tree
krag
recovered
himself
and
burst
into
a
roaring
laugh
seeming
not
a
whit
discomposed
still
what
i
it
true
or
untrue
maskull
gazed
at
him
sternly
you
seem
to
regard
yourself
as
a
necessary
evil
i
m
under
no
obligation
to
go
on
with
you
any
farther
i
think
we
had
better
krag
turned
to
gangnet
with
an
air
of
grotesque
mock
earnestness
what
do
you
we
part
when
maskull
pleases
or
when
i
please
keep
your
temper
maskull
said
gangnet
showing
krag
his
back
i
know
the
man
better
than
you
do
now
that
he
has
fastened
onto
you
there
s
only
one
way
of
making
him
lose
his
hold
by
ignoring
him
despise
nothing
to
him
don
t
answer
his
questions
if
you
refuse
to
recognise
his
existence
he
is
as
good
as
not
i
m
beginning
to
be
tired
of
it
all
said
maskull
it
seems
as
if
i
shall
add
one
more
to
my
murders
before
i
have
i
smell
murder
in
the
air
exclaimed
krag
pretending
to
sniff
but
whose
do
as
i
say
maskull
to
bandy
words
with
him
is
to
throw
oil
on
i
ll
say
no
more
to
anyone
when
do
we
get
out
of
this
accursed
forest
it
s
some
way
yet
but
when
we
re
once
out
we
can
take
to
the
water
and
you
will
be
able
to
rest
and
and
brood
comfortably
over
your
sufferings
added
krag
none
of
the
three
men
said
anything
more
until
they
emerged
into
the
open
day
the
slope
of
the
forest
was
so
steep
that
they
were
forced
to
run
rather
than
walk
and
this
would
have
prevented
any
conversation
even
if
they
had
otherwise
felt
inclined
toward
it
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
were
through
a
flat
open
landscape
lay
stretched
in
front
of
them
as
far
as
they
could
see
three
parts
of
this
country
consisted
of
smooth
water
it
was
a
succession
of
large
lakes
divided
by
narrow
strips
of
covered
land
the
lake
immediately
before
them
had
its
small
end
to
the
forest
it
was
there
about
a
third
of
a
mile
wide
the
water
at
the
sides
and
end
was
shallow
and
choked
with
rushes
but
in
the
middle
beginning
a
few
yards
from
the
shore
there
was
a
perceptible
current
away
from
them
in
view
of
this
current
it
was
difficult
to
decide
whether
it
was
a
lake
or
a
river
some
little
floating
islands
were
in
the
shallows
is
it
here
that
we
take
to
the
water
inquired
maskull
yes
here
answered
gangnet
but
how
one
of
those
islands
will
serve
it
only
needs
to
move
it
into
the
maskull
frowned
where
will
it
carry
us
to
come
get
on
get
on
said
krag
laughing
uncouthly
the
morning
s
wearing
away
and
you
have
to
die
before
noon
we
are
going
to
the
if
you
are
omniscient
krag
what
is
my
death
to
be
gangnet
will
murder
you
lie
said
gangnet
i
wish
maskull
nothing
but
at
all
events
he
will
be
the
cause
of
your
death
but
what
does
it
matter
the
great
point
is
you
are
quitting
this
futile
world
well
gangnet
i
see
you
re
as
slack
as
ever
i
suppose
i
must
do
the
he
jumped
into
the
lake
and
began
to
run
through
the
shallow
water
splashing
it
about
when
he
came
to
the
nearest
island
the
water
was
up
to
his
thighs
the
island
was
and
about
fifteen
feet
from
end
to
end
it
was
composed
of
a
sort
of
light
brown
peat
there
was
no
form
of
living
vegetation
on
its
surface
krag
went
behind
it
and
started
shoving
it
toward
the
current
apparently
without
having
unduly
to
exert
himself
when
it
was
within
the
influence
of
the
stream
the
others
waded
out
to
him
and
all
three
climbed
on
the
voyage
began
the
current
was
not
travelling
at
more
than
two
miles
an
hour
the
sun
glared
down
on
their
heads
mercilessly
and
there
was
no
shade
or
prospect
of
shade
maskull
sat
down
near
the
edge
and
periodically
splashed
water
over
his
head
gangnet
sat
on
his
haunches
next
to
him
krag
paced
up
and
down
with
short
quick
steps
like
an
animal
in
a
cage
the
lake
widened
out
more
and
more
and
the
width
of
the
stream
increased
in
proportion
until
they
seemed
to
themselves
to
be
floating
on
the
bosom
of
some
broad
flowing
estuary
krag
suddenly
bent
over
and
snatched
off
gangnet
s
hat
crushing
it
together
in
his
hairy
fist
and
throwing
it
far
out
into
the
stream
why
should
you
disguise
yourself
like
a
woman
he
asked
with
a
harsh
show
maskull
your
face
perhaps
he
has
seen
it
gangnet
did
remind
maskull
of
someone
but
he
could
not
say
of
whom
his
dark
hair
curled
down
to
his
neck
his
brow
was
wide
lofty
and
noble
and
there
was
an
air
of
serious
sweetness
about
the
whole
man
that
was
strangely
appealing
to
the
feelings
let
maskull
judge
he
said
with
proud
composure
whether
i
have
anything
to
be
ashamed
there
can
be
nothing
but
magnificent
thoughts
in
that
head
muttered
maskull
staring
hard
at
him
a
capital
valuation
gangnet
is
the
king
of
poets
but
what
happens
when
poets
try
to
carry
through
practical
enterprises
what
enterprises
asked
maskull
in
astonishment
what
have
you
got
on
hand
gangnet
tell
there
are
two
forms
of
practical
activity
replied
gangnet
calmly
one
may
either
build
up
or
no
there
s
a
third
species
one
may
not
even
know
one
is
stealing
one
may
take
the
purse
and
leave
the
maskull
raised
his
eyebrows
where
have
you
two
met
before
i
m
paying
gangnet
a
visit
today
maskull
but
once
upon
a
time
gangnet
paid
me
a
where
in
my
that
is
gangnet
is
a
common
you
are
speaking
in
riddles
and
i
don
t
understand
you
i
don
t
know
either
of
you
but
it
s
clear
that
if
gangnet
is
a
poet
you
re
a
buffoon
must
you
go
on
talking
i
want
to
be
krag
laughed
but
said
no
more
presently
he
lay
down
at
full
length
with
his
face
to
the
sun
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
fast
asleep
and
snoring
disagreeably
maskull
kept
glancing
over
at
his
yellow
repulsive
face
with
strong
disfavour
two
hours
passed
the
land
on
either
side
was
more
than
a
mile
distant
in
front
of
them
there
was
no
land
at
all
behind
them
the
lichstorm
mountains
were
blotted
out
from
view
by
a
haze
that
had
gathered
together
the
sky
ahead
just
above
the
horizon
began
to
be
of
a
strange
colour
it
was
an
intense
the
whole
northern
atmosphere
was
stained
with
ulfire
maskull
s
mind
grew
disturbed
alppain
is
rising
gangnet
smiled
wistfully
it
begins
to
trouble
you
it
is
so
it
recalls
me
to
earth
life
was
no
longer
this
is
daylight
is
night
to
this
other
daylight
within
half
an
hour
you
will
be
like
a
man
who
has
stepped
from
a
dark
forest
into
the
open
day
then
you
will
ask
yourself
how
you
could
have
been
the
two
men
went
on
watching
the
blue
sunrise
the
entire
sky
in
the
north
halfway
up
to
the
zenith
was
streaked
with
extraordinary
colours
among
which
jale
and
dolm
predominated
just
as
the
principal
character
of
an
ordinary
dawn
is
mystery
the
outstanding
character
of
this
dawn
was
wildness
it
did
not
baffle
the
understanding
but
the
heart
maskull
felt
no
inarticulate
craving
to
seize
and
perpetuate
the
sunrise
and
make
it
his
own
instead
of
that
it
agitated
and
tormented
him
like
the
opening
bars
of
a
supernatural
symphony
when
he
looked
back
to
the
south
branchspell
s
day
had
lost
its
glare
and
he
could
gaze
at
the
immense
white
sun
without
flinching
he
instinctively
turned
to
the
north
again
as
one
turns
from
darkness
to
light
if
those
were
crystalman
s
thoughts
that
you
showed
me
before
gangnet
these
must
be
his
feelings
i
mean
it
literally
what
i
am
feeling
now
he
must
have
felt
before
he
is
all
feeling
t
you
understand
that
maskull
was
feeding
greedily
on
the
spectacle
before
him
he
did
not
reply
his
face
was
set
like
a
rock
but
his
eyes
were
dim
with
the
beginning
of
tears
the
sky
blazed
deeper
and
deeper
it
was
obvious
that
alppain
was
about
to
lift
itself
above
the
sea
the
island
had
by
this
time
floated
past
the
mouth
of
the
estuary
on
three
sides
they
were
surrounded
by
water
the
haze
crept
up
behind
them
and
shut
out
all
sight
of
land
krag
was
still
ugly
wrinkled
monstrosity
maskull
looked
over
the
side
at
the
flowing
water
it
had
lost
its
dark
green
colour
and
was
now
of
a
perfect
crystal
transparency
are
we
already
on
the
ocean
gangnet
then
nothing
remains
except
my
don
t
think
of
death
but
it
s
growing
the
same
time
more
sombre
krag
seems
to
be
fading
away
there
is
alppain
said
gangnet
touching
his
arm
the
deep
glowing
disk
of
the
blue
sun
peeped
above
the
sea
maskull
was
struck
to
silence
he
was
hardly
so
much
looking
as
feeling
his
emotions
were
unutterable
his
soul
seemed
too
strong
for
his
body
the
great
blue
orb
rose
rapidly
out
of
the
water
like
an
awful
eye
watching
him
it
shot
above
the
sea
with
a
bound
and
alppain
s
day
commenced
what
do
you
feel
gangnet
still
held
his
arm
i
have
set
myself
against
the
infinite
muttered
maskull
suddenly
his
chaos
of
passions
sprang
together
and
a
wonderful
idea
swept
through
his
whole
being
accompanied
by
the
intensest
joy
why
am
no
you
are
the
mist
closed
in
all
around
them
nothing
was
visible
except
the
two
suns
and
a
few
feet
of
sea
the
shadows
of
the
three
men
cast
by
alppain
were
not
black
but
were
composed
of
white
daylight
then
nothing
can
hurt
me
said
maskull
with
a
peculiar
smile
gangnet
smiled
too
how
could
it
i
have
lost
my
will
i
feel
as
if
some
foul
tumour
had
been
scraped
away
leaving
me
clean
and
do
you
now
understand
life
maskull
gangnet
s
face
was
transfigured
with
an
extraordinary
spiritual
beauty
he
looked
as
if
he
had
descended
from
heaven
i
understand
nothing
except
that
i
have
no
self
any
more
but
this
is
is
gangnet
expatiating
on
his
famous
blue
sun
said
a
jeering
voice
above
them
looking
up
they
saw
that
krag
had
got
to
his
feet
they
both
rose
at
the
same
moment
the
gathering
mist
began
to
obscure
alppain
s
disk
changing
it
from
blue
to
a
vivid
jale
what
do
you
want
with
us
krag
asked
maskull
with
simple
composure
krag
looked
at
him
strangely
for
a
few
seconds
the
water
lapped
around
them
don
t
you
comprehend
maskull
that
your
death
has
arrived
maskull
made
no
response
krag
rested
an
arm
lightly
on
his
shoulder
and
suddenly
he
felt
sick
and
faint
he
sank
to
the
ground
near
the
edge
of
the
island
raft
his
heart
was
thumping
heavily
and
queerly
its
beating
reminded
him
of
the
drum
taps
he
gazed
languidly
at
the
rippling
water
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
could
see
right
through
it
away
away
down
to
a
strange
fire
the
water
disappeared
the
two
suns
were
extinguished
the
island
was
transformed
into
a
cloud
and
on
floating
through
the
atmosphere
down
below
it
was
all
fire
of
muspel
the
light
mounted
higher
and
higher
until
it
filled
the
whole
world
he
floated
toward
an
immense
perpendicular
cliff
of
black
rock
without
top
or
bottom
halfway
up
it
krag
suspended
in
midair
was
dealing
terrific
blows
at
a
spot
with
a
huge
hammer
the
rhythmical
clanging
sounds
were
hideous
presently
maskull
made
out
that
these
sounds
were
the
familiar
drum
beats
what
are
you
doing
krag
he
asked
krag
suspended
his
work
and
turned
around
beating
on
your
heart
maskull
was
his
grinning
response
the
cliff
and
krag
vanished
maskull
saw
gangnet
struggling
in
the
it
was
not
was
crystalman
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
escape
from
the
which
kept
surrounding
and
licking
him
whichever
way
he
turned
he
was
screaming
the
fire
caught
him
he
shrieked
horribly
maskull
caught
one
glimpse
of
a
vulgar
slobbering
then
that
too
disappeared
he
opened
his
eyes
the
floating
island
was
still
faintly
illuminated
by
alppain
krag
was
standing
by
his
side
but
gangnet
was
no
longer
there
what
is
this
ocean
called
asked
maskull
bringing
out
the
words
with
difficulty
surtur
s
maskull
nodded
and
kept
quiet
for
some
time
he
rested
his
face
on
his
arm
where
s
nightspore
he
asked
suddenly
krag
bent
over
him
with
a
grave
expression
you
are
the
dying
man
closed
his
eyes
and
smiled
opening
them
again
a
few
moments
later
with
an
effort
he
murmured
who
are
you
krag
maintained
a
gloomy
silence
shortly
afterward
a
frightful
pang
passed
through
maskull
s
heart
and
he
died
immediately
krag
turned
his
head
around
the
night
is
really
past
at
last
nightspore
the
day
is
nightspore
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
maskull
s
body
why
was
all
this
necessary
ask
crystalman
replied
krag
sternly
his
world
is
no
joke
he
has
a
strong
i
have
a
stronger
maskull
was
his
but
nightspore
is
chapter
muspel
the
fog
thickened
so
that
the
two
suns
wholly
disappeared
and
all
grew
as
black
as
night
nightspore
could
no
longer
see
his
companion
the
water
lapped
gently
against
the
side
of
the
island
raft
you
say
the
night
is
past
said
nightspore
but
the
night
is
still
here
am
i
dead
or
alive
you
are
still
in
crystalman
s
world
but
you
belong
to
it
no
more
we
are
approaching
nightspore
felt
a
strong
silent
throbbing
of
the
rhythmical
pulsation
in
time
there
is
the
drumming
he
exclaimed
do
you
understand
it
or
have
you
forgotten
i
half
understand
it
but
i
m
all
it
s
evident
crystalman
has
dug
his
claws
into
you
pretty
deeply
said
krag
the
sound
comes
from
muspel
but
the
rhythm
is
caused
by
its
travelling
through
crystalman
s
atmosphere
his
nature
is
rhythm
as
he
loves
to
call
dull
deadly
repetition
as
i
name
i
remember
said
nightspore
biting
his
nails
in
the
dark
the
throbbing
became
audible
it
now
sounded
like
a
distant
drum
a
small
patch
of
strange
light
in
the
far
distance
straight
ahead
of
them
began
faintly
to
illuminate
the
floating
island
and
the
glassy
sea
around
it
do
all
men
escape
from
that
ghastly
world
or
only
i
and
a
few
like
me
asked
nightspore
if
all
escaped
i
shouldn
t
sweat
my
friend
there
s
hard
work
and
anguish
and
the
risk
of
total
death
waiting
for
us
nightspore
s
heart
sank
have
i
not
yet
finished
then
if
you
wish
it
you
have
got
through
but
will
you
wish
it
the
drumming
grew
loud
and
painful
the
light
resolved
itself
into
a
tiny
oblong
of
mysterious
brightness
in
a
huge
wall
of
night
krag
s
grim
and
rocklike
features
were
revealed
i
can
t
face
rebirth
said
nightspore
the
horror
of
death
is
nothing
to
you
will
i
can
do
nothing
crystalman
is
too
powerful
i
barely
escaped
with
my
own
you
are
still
stupid
with
earth
fumes
and
see
nothing
straight
said
krag
nightspore
made
no
reply
but
seemed
to
be
trying
to
recall
something
the
water
around
them
was
so
still
colourless
and
transparent
that
they
scarcely
seemed
to
be
borne
up
by
liquid
matter
at
all
maskull
s
corpse
had
disappeared
the
drumming
was
now
like
the
clanging
of
iron
the
oblong
patch
of
light
grew
much
bigger
it
burned
fierce
and
wild
the
darkness
above
below
and
on
either
side
of
it
began
to
shape
itself
into
the
semblance
of
a
huge
black
wall
without
bounds
is
that
really
a
wall
we
are
coming
to
you
will
soon
find
out
what
you
see
is
muspel
and
that
light
is
the
gate
you
have
to
nightspore
s
heart
beat
wildly
shall
i
remember
he
muttered
yes
you
ll
accompany
me
krag
or
i
shall
be
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
in
there
i
shall
wait
outside
for
you
are
returning
to
the
struggle
demanded
nightspore
gnawing
his
fingertips
i
dare
the
thunderous
clangor
of
the
rhythmical
beats
struck
on
his
head
like
actual
blows
the
light
glared
so
vividly
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
look
at
it
it
had
the
startling
irregularity
of
continuous
lightning
but
it
possessed
this
further
it
seemed
somehow
to
give
out
not
actual
light
but
emotion
seen
as
light
they
continued
to
approach
the
wall
of
darkness
straight
toward
the
door
the
glasslike
water
flowed
right
against
it
its
surface
reaching
up
almost
to
the
threshold
they
could
not
speak
any
more
the
noise
was
too
deafening
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
before
the
gateway
nightspore
turned
his
back
and
hid
his
eyes
in
his
two
hands
but
even
then
he
was
blinded
by
the
light
so
passionate
were
his
feelings
that
his
body
seemed
to
enlarge
itself
at
every
frightful
beat
of
sound
he
quivered
violently
the
entrance
was
doorless
krag
jumped
onto
the
rocky
platform
and
pulled
nightspore
after
him
once
through
the
gateway
the
light
vanished
the
rhythmical
totally
ceased
nightspore
dropped
his
hands
all
was
dark
and
quiet
as
an
opened
tomb
but
the
air
was
filled
with
grim
burning
passion
which
was
to
light
and
sound
what
light
itself
is
to
opaque
colour
nightspore
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
i
don
t
know
if
i
can
endure
it
he
said
looking
toward
krag
he
felt
his
person
far
more
vividly
and
distinctly
than
if
he
had
been
able
to
see
him
go
in
and
lose
no
time
nightspore
time
here
is
more
precious
than
on
earth
we
can
t
squander
the
minutes
there
are
terrible
and
tragic
affairs
to
attend
to
which
won
t
wait
for
us
go
in
at
once
stop
for
where
shall
i
go
to
muttered
nightspore
i
have
forgotten
enter
enter
there
is
only
one
way
you
can
t
mistake
why
do
you
bid
me
go
in
if
i
am
to
come
out
again
to
have
your
wounds
almost
before
the
words
had
left
his
mouth
krag
sprang
back
on
to
the
island
raft
nightspore
involuntarily
started
after
him
but
at
once
recovered
himself
and
remained
standing
where
he
was
krag
was
completely
invisible
everything
outside
was
black
night
the
moment
he
had
gone
a
feeling
shot
up
in
nightspore
s
heart
like
a
thousand
trumpets
straight
in
front
of
him
almost
at
his
feet
was
the
lower
end
of
a
steep
narrow
circular
flight
of
stone
steps
there
was
no
other
way
forward
he
put
his
foot
on
the
bottom
stair
at
the
same
time
peering
aloft
he
saw
nothing
yet
as
he
proceeded
upward
every
inch
of
the
way
was
perceptible
to
his
inner
feelings
the
staircase
was
cold
dismal
and
deserted
but
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
exaltation
of
soul
like
a
ladder
to
heaven
after
he
had
mounted
a
dozen
steps
or
so
he
paused
to
take
breath
each
step
was
increasingly
difficult
to
ascend
he
felt
as
though
he
were
carrying
a
heavy
man
on
his
shoulders
it
struck
a
familiar
chord
in
his
mind
he
went
on
and
ten
stairs
higher
up
came
to
a
window
set
in
a
high
embrasure
on
to
this
he
clambered
and
looked
through
the
window
was
of
a
sort
of
glass
but
he
could
see
nothing
coming
to
him
however
from
the
world
outside
a
disturbance
of
the
atmosphere
struck
his
senses
causing
his
blood
to
run
cold
at
one
moment
it
resembled
a
low
mocking
vulgar
laugh
travelling
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
at
the
next
it
was
like
a
rhythmical
vibration
of
the
silent
continuous
throbbing
of
some
mighty
engine
the
two
sensations
were
identical
yet
different
they
seemed
to
be
related
in
the
same
manner
as
soul
and
body
after
feeling
them
for
a
long
time
nightspore
got
down
from
the
embrasure
and
continued
his
ascent
having
meanwhile
grown
very
serious
the
climbing
became
still
more
laborious
and
he
was
forced
to
stop
at
every
third
or
fourth
step
to
rest
his
muscles
and
regain
breath
when
he
had
mounted
another
twenty
stairs
in
this
way
he
came
to
a
second
window
again
he
saw
nothing
the
laughing
disturbance
of
the
air
too
had
ceased
but
the
atmospheric
throb
was
now
twice
as
distinct
as
before
and
its
rhythm
had
become
there
were
two
separate
pulses
one
was
in
the
time
of
a
march
the
other
in
the
time
of
a
waltz
the
first
was
bitter
and
petrifying
to
feel
but
the
second
was
gay
enervating
and
horrible
nightspore
spent
little
time
at
that
window
for
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
a
great
discovery
and
that
something
far
more
important
awaited
him
higher
up
he
proceeded
aloft
the
ascent
grew
more
and
more
exhausting
so
much
so
that
he
had
frequently
to
sit
down
utterly
crushed
by
his
own
dead
weight
still
he
got
to
the
third
window
he
climbed
into
the
embrasure
his
feelings
translated
themselves
into
vision
and
he
saw
a
sight
that
caused
him
to
turn
pale
a
gigantic
sphere
was
hanging
in
the
sky
occupying
nearly
the
whole
of
it
this
sphere
was
composed
entirely
of
two
kinds
of
active
beings
there
were
a
myriad
of
tiny
green
corpuscles
varying
in
size
from
the
very
small
to
the
almost
indiscernible
they
were
not
green
but
he
somehow
saw
them
so
they
were
all
striving
in
one
himself
toward
muspel
but
were
too
feeble
and
miniature
to
make
any
headway
their
action
produced
the
marching
rhythm
he
had
previously
felt
but
this
rhythm
was
not
intrinsic
in
the
corpuscles
themselves
but
was
a
consequence
of
the
obstruction
they
met
with
and
surrounding
these
atoms
of
life
and
light
were
far
larger
whirls
of
white
light
that
gyrated
hither
and
thither
carrying
the
green
corpuscles
with
them
wherever
they
desired
their
whirling
motion
was
accompanied
by
the
waltzing
rhythm
it
seemed
to
nightspore
that
the
green
atoms
were
not
only
being
danced
about
against
their
will
but
were
suffering
excruciating
shame
and
degradation
in
consequence
the
larger
ones
were
steadier
than
the
extremely
small
a
few
were
even
almost
stationary
and
one
was
advancing
in
the
direction
it
wished
to
go
he
turned
his
back
to
the
window
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
searched
in
the
dim
recesses
of
his
memory
for
an
explanation
of
what
he
had
just
seen
nothing
came
straight
but
horror
and
wrath
began
to
take
possession
of
him
on
his
way
upward
to
the
next
window
invisible
fingers
seemed
to
him
to
be
squeezing
his
heart
and
twisting
it
about
here
and
there
but
he
never
dreamed
of
turning
back
his
mood
was
so
grim
that
he
did
not
once
permit
himself
to
pause
such
was
his
physical
distress
by
the
time
that
he
had
clambered
into
the
recess
that
for
several
minutes
he
could
see
nothing
at
world
seemed
to
be
spinning
round
him
rapidly
when
at
last
he
looked
he
saw
the
same
sphere
as
before
but
now
all
was
changed
on
it
it
was
a
world
of
rocks
minerals
water
plants
animals
and
men
he
saw
the
whole
world
at
one
view
yet
everything
was
so
magnified
that
he
could
distinguish
the
smallest
details
of
life
in
the
interior
of
every
individual
of
every
aggregate
of
individuals
of
every
chemical
atom
he
clearly
perceived
the
presence
of
the
green
corpuscles
but
according
to
the
degree
of
dignity
of
the
life
form
they
were
fragmentary
or
comparatively
large
in
the
crystal
for
example
the
green
imprisoned
life
was
so
minute
as
to
be
scarcely
visible
in
some
men
it
was
hardly
bigger
but
in
other
men
and
women
it
was
twenty
or
a
hundred
times
greater
but
great
or
small
it
played
an
important
part
in
every
individual
it
appeared
as
if
the
whirls
of
white
light
which
were
the
individuals
and
plainly
showed
themselves
beneath
the
enveloping
bodies
were
delighted
with
existence
and
wished
only
to
enjoy
it
but
the
green
corpuscles
were
in
a
condition
of
eternal
discontent
yet
blind
and
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
for
liberation
kept
changing
form
as
though
breaking
a
new
path
by
way
of
experiment
whenever
the
old
grotesque
became
metamorphosed
into
the
new
grotesque
it
was
in
every
case
the
direct
work
of
the
green
atoms
trying
to
escape
toward
muspel
but
encountering
immediate
opposition
these
subdivided
sparks
of
living
fiery
spirit
were
hopelessly
imprisoned
in
a
ghastly
mush
of
soft
pleasure
they
were
being
effeminated
and
is
to
say
absorbed
in
the
foul
sickly
enveloping
forms
nightspore
felt
a
sickening
shame
in
his
soul
as
he
looked
on
at
that
spectacle
his
exaltation
had
long
since
vanished
he
bit
his
nails
and
understood
why
krag
was
waiting
for
him
below
he
mounted
slowly
to
the
fifth
window
the
pressure
of
air
against
him
was
as
strong
as
a
full
gale
divested
of
violence
and
irregularity
so
that
he
was
not
for
an
instant
suffered
to
relax
his
efforts
nevertheless
not
a
breath
stirred
looking
through
the
window
he
was
startled
by
a
new
sight
the
sphere
was
still
there
but
between
it
and
the
in
which
he
was
standing
he
perceived
a
dim
vast
shadow
without
any
distinguishable
shape
but
somehow
throwing
out
a
scent
of
disgusting
sweetness
nightspore
knew
that
it
was
crystalman
a
flood
of
fierce
it
was
not
light
but
streaming
all
the
time
from
muspel
to
the
shadow
and
through
it
when
however
it
emerged
on
the
other
side
which
was
the
sphere
the
light
was
altered
in
character
it
became
split
as
by
a
prism
into
the
two
forms
of
life
which
he
had
previously
green
corpuscles
and
the
whirls
what
had
been
fiery
spirit
but
a
moment
ago
was
now
a
disgusting
mass
of
crawling
wriggling
individuals
each
whirl
of
will
having
as
nucleus
a
fragmentary
spark
of
living
green
fire
nightspore
recollected
the
back
rays
of
starkness
and
it
flashed
across
him
with
the
certainty
of
truth
that
the
green
sparks
were
the
back
rays
and
the
whirls
the
forward
rays
of
muspel
the
former
were
trying
desperately
to
return
to
their
place
of
origin
but
were
overpowered
by
the
brute
force
of
the
latter
which
wished
only
to
remain
where
they
were
the
individual
whirls
were
jostling
and
fighting
with
and
even
devouring
each
other
this
created
pain
but
whatever
pain
they
felt
it
was
always
pleasure
that
they
sought
sometimes
the
green
sparks
were
strong
enough
for
a
moment
to
move
a
little
way
in
the
direction
of
muspel
the
whirls
would
then
accept
the
movement
not
only
without
demur
but
with
pride
and
pleasure
as
if
it
were
their
own
they
never
saw
beyond
the
shadow
they
thought
that
they
were
travelling
toward
it
the
instant
the
direct
movement
wearied
them
as
contrary
to
their
whirling
nature
they
fell
again
to
killing
dancing
and
loving
nightspore
had
a
foreknowledge
that
the
sixth
window
would
prove
to
be
the
last
nothing
would
have
kept
him
from
ascending
to
it
for
he
guessed
that
the
nature
of
crystalman
himself
would
there
become
manifest
every
step
upward
was
like
a
bloody
struggle
the
stairs
nailed
him
to
the
ground
the
air
pressure
caused
blood
to
gush
from
his
nose
and
ears
his
head
clanged
like
an
iron
bell
when
he
had
fought
his
way
up
a
dozen
steps
he
found
himself
suddenly
at
the
top
the
staircase
terminated
in
a
small
bare
chamber
of
cold
stone
possessing
a
single
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
apartment
another
short
flight
of
stairs
mounted
through
a
trap
apparently
to
the
roof
of
the
building
before
ascending
these
stairs
nightspore
hastened
to
the
window
and
stared
out
the
shadow
form
of
crystalman
had
drawn
much
closer
to
him
and
filled
the
whole
sky
but
it
was
not
a
shadow
of
darkness
but
a
bright
shadow
it
had
neither
shape
nor
colour
yet
it
in
some
way
suggested
the
delicate
tints
of
early
morning
it
was
so
nebulous
that
the
sphere
could
be
clearly
distinguished
through
it
in
extension
however
it
was
thick
the
sweet
smell
emanating
from
it
was
strong
loathsome
and
terrible
it
seemed
to
spring
from
a
sort
of
loose
mocking
slime
inexpressibly
vulgar
and
ignorant
the
spirit
stream
from
muspel
flashed
with
complexity
and
variety
it
was
not
below
individuality
but
above
it
it
was
not
the
one
or
the
many
but
something
else
far
beyond
either
it
approached
crystalman
and
entered
his
that
bright
mist
could
be
called
a
body
it
passed
right
through
him
and
the
passage
caused
him
the
most
exquisite
pleasure
was
crystalman
s
the
stream
emerged
from
the
other
side
on
to
the
sphere
in
a
double
condition
part
of
it
reappeared
intrinsically
unaltered
but
shivered
into
a
million
fragments
these
were
the
green
corpuscles
in
passing
through
crystalman
they
had
escaped
absorption
by
reason
of
their
extreme
minuteness
the
other
part
of
the
stream
had
not
escaped
its
fire
had
been
abstracted
its
cement
was
withdrawn
and
after
being
fouled
and
softened
by
the
horrible
sweetness
of
the
host
it
broke
into
individuals
which
were
the
whirls
of
living
will
nightspore
shuddered
he
comprehended
at
last
how
the
whole
world
of
will
was
doomed
to
eternal
anguish
in
order
that
one
being
might
feel
joy
presently
he
set
foot
on
the
final
flight
leading
to
the
roof
for
he
remembered
vaguely
that
now
only
that
remained
halfway
up
he
when
he
recovered
consciousness
he
persisted
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
him
as
soon
as
his
head
was
above
the
trap
breathing
the
free
air
he
had
the
same
physical
sensation
as
a
man
stepping
out
of
water
he
pulled
his
body
up
and
stood
expectantly
on
the
roof
looking
round
for
his
first
glimpse
of
muspel
there
was
nothing
he
was
standing
upon
the
top
of
a
tower
measuring
not
above
fifteen
feet
each
way
darkness
was
all
around
him
he
sat
down
on
the
stone
parapet
with
a
sinking
heart
a
heavy
foreboding
possessed
him
suddenly
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
he
had
the
distinct
impression
that
the
darkness
around
him
on
all
four
sides
was
grinning
as
soon
as
that
happened
he
understood
that
he
was
wholly
surrounded
by
crystalman
s
world
and
that
muspel
consisted
of
himself
and
the
stone
tower
on
which
he
was
sitting
fire
flashed
in
his
heart
millions
upon
millions
of
grotesque
vulgar
ridiculous
sweetened
calling
out
from
their
degradation
and
agony
for
salvation
from
muspel
to
answer
that
cry
there
was
only
himself
and
krag
waiting
below
and
where
was
surtur
the
truth
forced
itself
on
him
in
all
its
cold
brutal
reality
muspel
was
no
universe
tolerating
from
pure
indifference
the
existence
side
by
side
with
it
of
another
false
world
which
had
no
right
to
be
muspel
was
fighting
for
its
all
that
is
most
shameful
and
sin
masquerading
as
eternal
beauty
against
baseness
masquerading
as
nature
against
the
devil
masquerading
as
god
now
he
understood
everything
the
moral
combat
was
no
mock
one
no
valhalla
where
warriors
are
cut
to
pieces
by
day
and
feast
by
night
but
a
grim
death
struggle
in
which
what
is
worse
than
spiritual
awaited
the
vanquished
of
muspel
by
what
means
could
he
hold
back
from
this
horrible
war
during
those
moments
of
anguish
all
thoughts
of
corruption
of
his
life
on
scorched
out
of
nightspore
s
soul
perhaps
not
for
the
first
time
after
sitting
a
long
time
he
prepared
to
descend
without
warning
a
strange
wailing
cry
swept
over
the
face
of
the
world
starting
in
awful
mystery
it
ended
with
such
a
note
of
low
and
sordid
mockery
that
he
could
not
doubt
for
a
moment
whence
it
originated
it
was
the
voice
of
crystalman
krag
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
island
raft
he
threw
a
stern
glance
at
nightspore
have
you
seen
everything
the
struggle
is
hopeless
muttered
nightspore
did
i
not
say
i
am
the
stronger
you
may
be
the
stronger
but
he
is
the
i
am
the
stronger
and
the
mightier
crystalman
s
empire
is
but
a
shadow
on
the
face
of
muspel
but
nothing
will
be
done
without
the
bloodiest
blows
what
do
you
mean
to
do
nightspore
looked
at
him
strangely
are
you
not
surtur
krag
yes
said
nightspore
in
a
slow
voice
without
surprise
but
what
is
your
name
on
earth
it
is
that
too
i
must
have
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
stepped
quietly
onto
the
raft
krag
pushed
off
and
they
proceeded
into
the
darkness
