foreword
the
infant
phenomenon
in
literature
is
rarer
than
in
more
physical
branches
of
art
but
its
productions
are
not
likely
to
be
of
value
outside
the
doting
domestic
circle
even
pope
who
lisped
in
numbers
for
the
numbers
came
did
not
add
to
our
anthology
from
his
cradle
though
he
may
therein
have
acquired
his
monotonous
immaturity
of
mind
and
experience
so
easily
disguised
on
the
stage
or
the
even
by
adults
is
more
obvious
in
the
field
of
pure
intellect
the
contribution
with
which
mary
antin
makes
her
d√©but
in
letters
is
however
saved
from
the
emptiness
of
embryonic
thinking
by
being
a
record
of
a
real
experience
the
greatest
of
her
life
her
journey
from
poland
to
boston
even
so
and
remarkable
as
her
description
is
for
a
girl
of
eleven
for
it
was
at
this
age
that
she
first
wrote
the
thing
in
yiddish
though
she
was
thirteen
when
she
translated
it
into
english
it
would
scarcely
be
worth
publishing
merely
as
a
literary
curiosity
but
it
happens
to
possess
an
extraneous
value
for
despite
the
great
wave
of
russian
immigration
into
the
united
states
and
despite
the
noble
spirit
in
which
the
jews
of
america
have
grappled
with
the
invasion
we
still
know
too
little
of
the
inner
feelings
of
the
people
themselves
nor
do
we
adequately
realize
what
magic
vision
of
free
america
lures
them
on
to
face
the
great
journey
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
mary
antin
vivid
description
of
all
she
and
her
dear
ones
went
through
enables
us
to
see
almost
with
our
own
eyes
how
the
invasion
of
america
appears
to
the
impecunious
invader
it
is
thus
a
human
document
of
considerable
value
as
well
as
a
promissory
note
of
future
performance
the
quick
senses
of
the
child
her
keen
powers
of
observation
and
introspection
her
impressionability
both
to
sensations
and
complex
emotions
these
are
the
very
things
out
of
which
literature
is
made
the
raw
stuff
of
art
her
capacity
to
handle
english
after
so
short
a
residence
in
america
shows
that
she
possesses
also
the
instrument
of
expression
more
fortunate
than
the
poet
of
the
ghetto
morris
rosenfeld
she
will
have
at
her
command
the
most
popular
language
in
the
world
and
she
has
already
produced
in
it
passages
of
true
literature
especially
in
her
impressionistic
rendering
of
the
sea
and
the
bustling
phantasmagoria
of
travel
what
will
be
her
development
no
one
can
say
precisely
and
i
would
not
presume
either
to
predict
or
to
direct
it
for
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
it
will
probably
take
lyrical
shape
like
most
modern
jewesses
who
have
written
she
is
i
fear
destined
to
spiritual
suffering
fortunately
her
work
evidences
a
genial
talent
for
enjoyment
and
a
warm
humanity
which
may
serve
to
counterbalance
the
curse
of
reflectiveness
that
she
is
growing
is
evident
from
her
own
introduction
written
only
the
other
day
with
its
touches
of
humor
and
more
complex
manipulation
of
groups
of
facts
but
i
have
ventured
to
counsel
delay
rather
than
precipitation
in
production
for
she
is
not
yet
sixteen
and
the
completion
of
her
education
physical
no
less
than
intellectual
and
it
is
to
this
purpose
that
such
profits
as
may
accrue
from
this
publication
will
be
devoted
let
us
hope
this
premature
recognition
of
her
potentialities
will
not
injure
their
future
flowering
and
that
her
development
will
add
to
those
spiritual
and
intellectual
forces
of
which
american
judaism
stands
sorely
in
need
i
should
explain
in
conclusion
that
i
have
neither
added
nor
subtracted
even
a
comma
and
that
i
have
no
credit
in
discovering
mary
antin
i
did
but
endorse
the
verdict
of
that
kind
and
charming
boston
household
in
which
i
had
the
pleasure
of
encountering
the
gifted
polish
girl
and
to
a
member
of
which
this
little
volume
is
appropriately
dedicated
zangwill
prefatory
in
the
year
a
mighty
wave
of
the
emigration
movement
swept
over
all
parts
of
russia
carrying
with
it
a
vast
number
of
the
jewish
population
to
the
distant
shores
of
the
new
world
from
tyranny
to
democracy
from
darkness
to
light
from
bondage
and
persecution
to
freedom
justice
and
equality
but
the
great
mass
knew
nothing
of
these
things
they
were
going
to
the
foreign
world
in
hopes
only
of
earning
their
bread
and
worshiping
their
god
in
peace
the
different
currents
that
directed
the
course
of
that
wave
can
not
be
here
enumerated
suffice
it
to
say
that
its
power
was
enormous
all
over
the
land
homes
were
broken
up
families
separated
lives
completely
altered
for
a
common
end
the
emigration
fever
was
at
its
height
in
plotzk
my
native
town
in
the
central
western
part
of
russia
on
the
dvina
river
america
was
in
everybody
mouth
business
men
talked
of
it
over
their
accounts
the
market
women
made
up
their
quarrels
that
they
might
discuss
it
from
stall
to
stall
people
who
had
relatives
in
the
famous
land
went
around
reading
their
letters
for
the
enlightenment
of
less
fortunate
folks
the
one
informed
the
public
how
many
letters
arrived
from
america
and
who
were
the
recipients
children
played
at
emigrating
old
folks
shook
their
sage
heads
over
the
evening
fire
and
prophesied
no
good
for
those
who
braved
the
terrors
of
the
sea
and
the
foreign
goal
beyond
it
all
talked
of
it
but
scarcely
anybody
knew
one
true
fact
about
this
magic
land
for
was
not
for
them
and
a
few
persons
they
were
a
dressmaker
daughter
and
a
merchant
with
his
two
sons
who
had
returned
from
america
after
a
long
visit
happened
to
be
endowed
with
extraordinary
imagination
a
faculty
closely
related
to
their
knowledge
of
their
old
ignorance
and
their
descriptions
of
life
across
the
ocean
given
daily
for
some
months
to
eager
audiences
surpassed
anything
in
the
arabian
nights
one
sad
fact
threw
a
shadow
over
the
splendor
of
the
fairyland
the
travelers
all
agreed
that
jews
lived
there
in
the
most
shocking
impiety
driven
by
a
necessity
for
bettering
the
family
circumstances
and
by
certain
minor
forces
which
can
not
now
be
named
my
father
began
to
think
seriously
of
casting
his
lot
with
the
great
stream
of
emigrants
many
family
councils
were
held
before
it
was
agreed
that
the
plan
must
be
carried
out
then
came
the
parting
for
it
was
impossible
for
the
whole
family
to
go
at
once
i
remember
it
though
i
was
only
eight
it
struck
me
as
rather
interesting
to
stand
on
the
platform
before
the
train
with
a
crowd
of
friends
weeping
in
sympathy
with
us
and
father
waving
his
hat
for
our
special
benefit
and
saying
the
last
words
we
heard
him
speak
as
the
train
moved
off
plotzk
forever
then
followed
three
long
years
of
hope
and
doubt
for
father
in
america
and
us
in
russia
there
were
toil
and
suffering
and
waiting
and
anxiety
for
all
there
were
but
to
tell
of
all
that
happened
in
those
years
i
should
have
to
write
a
separate
history
the
happy
day
came
when
we
received
the
summons
and
what
stirring
times
followed
the
period
of
preparation
was
one
of
constant
delight
to
us
children
we
were
four
my
two
sisters
one
brother
and
myself
our
playmates
looked
up
to
us
in
respectful
admiration
neighbors
if
they
made
no
direct
investigations
bribed
us
with
nice
things
for
information
as
to
what
was
going
into
every
box
package
and
basket
and
the
house
was
dismantled
people
came
and
carried
off
the
furniture
closets
sheds
and
other
nooks
were
emptied
of
their
contents
the
great
was
taken
away
until
only
a
few
logs
remained
ancient
treasures
such
as
women
are
so
loath
to
part
with
and
which
mother
had
carried
with
her
from
a
dear
little
house
whence
poverty
had
driven
us
were
brought
to
light
from
their
hiding
places
and
sacrificed
at
the
altar
whose
flames
were
consuming
so
much
that
was
fraught
with
precious
association
and
endeared
by
family
tradition
the
number
of
bundles
and
boxes
increased
daily
and
our
home
vanished
hourly
the
rooms
became
quite
uninhabitable
at
last
and
we
children
glanced
in
glee
to
the
anger
of
the
echoes
when
we
heard
that
in
the
evening
we
were
to
start
upon
our
journey
but
we
did
not
go
till
the
next
morning
and
then
as
secretly
as
possible
for
despite
the
glowing
tales
concerning
america
people
flocked
to
the
departure
of
emigrants
much
as
they
did
to
a
funeral
to
weep
and
lament
while
in
the
former
case
only
i
believe
they
envied
as
everybody
in
plotzk
knew
us
and
as
the
departure
of
a
whole
family
was
very
rousing
we
dared
not
brave
the
sympathetic
presence
of
the
whole
township
that
we
knew
we
might
expect
so
we
gave
out
a
false
alarm
even
then
there
was
half
the
population
of
plotzk
on
hand
the
next
morning
we
were
the
heroes
of
the
hour
i
remember
how
the
women
crowded
around
mother
charging
her
to
deliver
messages
to
their
relatives
in
america
how
they
made
the
air
ring
with
their
unintelligible
chorus
how
they
showered
down
upon
us
scores
of
suggestions
and
admonitions
how
they
made
us
frantic
with
their
sympathetic
weeping
and
wringing
of
hands
how
finally
the
ringing
of
the
signal
bell
set
them
all
talking
faster
and
louder
than
ever
in
desperate
efforts
to
give
the
last
bits
of
advice
deliver
the
last
messages
and
to
their
credit
let
it
be
said
to
give
the
final
hearty
unfeigned
kisses
hugs
and
good
wishes
well
we
lived
through
three
years
of
waiting
and
also
through
a
half
hour
of
parting
some
of
our
relatives
came
near
being
carried
off
as
heedless
of
the
last
bell
they
lingered
on
in
the
car
but
at
last
they
too
had
to
go
and
we
the
wanderers
could
scarcely
see
the
rainbow
wave
of
colored
handkerchiefs
as
dissolved
in
tears
we
were
carried
out
of
plotzk
away
from
home
but
nearer
our
haven
of
reunion
nearer
indeed
to
everything
that
makes
life
beautiful
and
gives
one
an
aim
and
an
end
freedom
progress
knowledge
light
and
truth
with
their
glorious
host
of
followers
but
we
did
not
know
it
then
the
following
pages
contain
the
description
of
our
journey
as
i
wrote
it
four
years
ago
when
it
was
all
fresh
in
my
memory
a
from
plotzk
to
boston
the
short
journey
from
plotzk
to
vilna
was
uneventful
station
after
station
was
passed
without
our
taking
any
interest
in
anything
for
that
leave
taking
at
the
plotzk
railway
station
left
us
all
in
such
a
state
of
apathy
to
all
things
except
our
own
thoughts
as
could
not
easily
be
thrown
off
indeed
had
we
not
been
obliged
to
change
trains
at
devinsk
and
being
the
inexperienced
travellers
we
were
do
a
great
deal
of
bustling
and
hurrying
and
questioning
of
porters
and
mere
idlers
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
would
have
remained
in
that
same
thoughtful
silent
state
towards
evening
we
reached
vilna
and
such
a
welcome
as
we
got
up
to
then
i
had
never
seen
such
a
mob
of
porters
and
isvostchiky
i
do
not
clearly
remember
just
what
occurred
but
a
most
vivid
recollection
of
being
very
uneasy
for
a
time
is
still
retained
in
my
memory
you
see
my
uncle
was
to
have
met
us
at
the
station
but
urgent
business
kept
him
elsewhere
now
it
was
universally
believed
in
plotzk
that
it
was
wise
not
to
trust
the
first
isvostchik
who
offered
his
services
when
one
arrived
in
vilna
a
stranger
and
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
how
mother
managed
to
get
away
from
the
mob
and
how
above
all
she
dared
to
trust
herself
with
her
precious
baggage
to
one
of
them
but
i
have
thought
better
of
vilna
isvostchiky
since
for
we
were
safely
landed
after
a
pretty
long
drive
in
front
of
my
uncle
store
with
never
one
of
our
number
lost
never
a
bundle
stolen
or
any
mishap
whatever
our
stay
in
vilna
was
marked
by
nothing
of
interest
we
stayed
only
long
enough
for
some
necessary
papers
to
reach
us
and
during
that
time
i
discovered
that
vilna
was
very
much
like
plotzk
though
larger
cleaner
and
noisier
there
were
the
same
coarse
women
in
the
market
the
same
kind
of
storekeepers
in
the
low
store
doors
forever
struggling
and
quarrelling
for
a
customer
the
only
really
interesting
things
i
remember
were
the
horsecars
which
i
had
never
even
heard
of
and
in
one
of
which
i
had
a
lovely
ride
for
five
copeiky
and
a
large
book
store
on
the
nemetzka
yah
ulitza
the
latter
object
may
not
seem
of
any
interest
to
most
people
but
i
had
never
seen
so
many
books
in
one
place
before
and
i
could
not
help
regarding
them
with
longing
and
wonder
at
last
all
was
in
readiness
for
our
start
this
was
really
the
beginning
of
our
long
journey
which
i
shall
endeavor
to
describe
i
will
not
give
any
description
of
the
various
places
we
passed
for
we
stopped
at
few
places
and
always
under
circumstances
which
did
not
permit
of
sightseeing
i
shall
only
speak
of
such
things
as
made
a
distinct
impression
upon
my
mind
which
it
must
be
remembered
was
not
mature
enough
to
be
impressed
by
what
older
minds
were
while
on
the
contrary
it
was
in
just
the
state
to
take
in
many
things
which
others
heeded
not
i
do
not
know
the
exact
date
but
i
do
know
that
it
was
at
the
break
of
day
on
a
sunday
and
very
early
in
april
when
we
left
vilna
we
had
not
slept
any
the
night
before
fannie
and
i
spent
the
long
hours
in
playing
various
quiet
games
and
watching
the
clock
at
last
the
long
expected
hour
arrived
our
train
would
be
due
in
a
short
time
all
but
fannie
and
myself
had
by
this
time
fallen
into
a
drowse
half
sitting
half
lying
on
some
of
the
many
baskets
and
boxes
that
stood
all
about
the
room
all
ready
to
be
taken
to
the
station
so
we
set
to
work
to
rouse
the
rest
and
with
the
aid
of
an
alarm
clock
loud
ringing
we
soon
had
them
at
least
half
awake
and
while
the
others
sat
rubbing
their
eyes
and
trying
to
look
wide
awake
uncle
borris
had
gone
out
and
when
he
returned
with
several
droskies
to
convey
us
to
the
station
we
were
all
ready
for
the
start
we
went
out
into
the
street
and
now
i
perceived
that
not
we
alone
were
sleepy
everything
slept
and
nature
also
slept
deeply
sweetly
the
sky
was
covered
with
dark
gray
clouds
perhaps
that
was
its
from
which
a
chill
drizzling
rain
was
slowly
descending
and
the
thick
morning
fog
shut
out
the
road
from
our
sight
no
sound
came
from
any
direction
slumber
and
quiet
reigned
everywhere
for
every
thing
and
person
slept
forgetful
for
a
time
of
joys
sorrows
hopes
fears
everything
sleepily
we
said
our
last
to
the
family
took
our
seats
in
the
droskies
and
soon
the
hospitalnayah
ulitza
was
lost
to
sight
as
the
vehicles
rattled
along
the
deserted
streets
the
noise
of
the
hoofs
and
the
wheels
striking
against
the
paving
stones
sounded
unusually
loud
in
the
general
hush
and
caused
the
echoes
to
answer
again
and
again
from
the
silent
streets
and
alleys
in
a
short
time
we
were
at
the
station
in
our
impatience
we
had
come
too
early
and
now
the
waiting
was
very
tiresome
everybody
knows
how
lively
and
noisy
it
is
at
a
railroad
station
when
a
train
is
expected
but
now
there
were
but
a
few
persons
present
and
in
everybody
face
i
could
see
the
reflection
of
my
own
dissatisfaction
because
like
myself
they
had
much
rather
have
been
in
a
comfortable
warm
bed
than
up
and
about
in
the
rain
and
fog
everything
was
so
uncomfortable
suddenly
we
heard
a
long
shrill
whistle
to
which
the
surrounding
dreariness
gave
a
strangely
mournful
sound
the
clattering
train
rushed
into
the
depot
and
stood
still
several
passengers
they
were
very
few
left
the
cars
and
hastened
towards
where
the
droskies
stood
and
after
rousing
the
sleepy
isvostchiky
were
whirled
away
to
their
several
destinations
when
we
had
secured
our
tickets
and
seen
to
the
baggage
we
entered
a
car
in
the
women
division
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
train
to
start
at
last
the
first
signal
was
given
then
the
second
and
third
the
locomotive
shrieked
and
puffed
the
train
moved
slowly
then
swiftly
it
left
the
depot
far
behind
it
from
vilna
to
our
next
stopping
place
verzbolovo
there
was
a
long
tedious
ride
of
about
eight
hours
as
the
day
continued
to
be
dull
and
foggy
very
little
could
be
seen
through
the
windows
besides
no
one
seemed
to
care
or
to
be
interested
in
anything
sleepy
and
tired
as
we
all
were
we
got
little
rest
except
the
younger
ones
for
we
had
not
yet
got
used
to
living
in
the
cars
and
could
not
make
ourselves
very
comfortable
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
we
remained
as
unsocial
as
the
weather
was
unpleasant
the
car
was
very
still
there
being
few
passengers
among
them
a
very
pleasant
kind
gentleman
travelling
with
his
pretty
daughter
mother
found
them
very
pleasant
to
chat
with
and
we
children
found
it
less
tiresome
to
listen
to
them
at
half
past
twelve
the
train
came
to
a
stop
before
a
large
depot
and
the
conductor
announced
verzbolovo
fifteen
minutes
the
sight
that
now
presented
itself
was
very
cheering
after
our
long
unpleasant
ride
the
weather
had
changed
very
much
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
not
a
trace
of
fog
or
cloud
was
to
be
seen
crowds
of
people
were
everywhere
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
passing
through
the
many
gates
leading
to
the
street
sitting
around
the
long
tables
eating
drinking
talking
or
reading
newspapers
waited
upon
by
the
liveliest
busiest
waiters
i
had
ever
seen
and
there
was
such
an
activity
and
bustle
about
everything
that
i
wished
i
could
join
in
it
it
seemed
so
hard
to
sit
still
but
i
had
to
content
myself
with
looking
on
with
the
others
while
the
friendly
gentleman
whose
acquaintance
my
mother
had
made
i
do
not
recollect
his
name
assisted
her
in
obtaining
our
tickets
for
eidtkunen
and
attending
to
everything
else
that
needed
attention
and
there
were
many
things
soon
the
fifteen
minutes
were
up
our
kind
and
his
daughter
bade
us
farewell
and
a
pleasant
journey
we
were
just
on
the
brink
of
the
beginning
of
our
troubles
the
train
puffed
out
of
the
depot
and
we
all
felt
we
were
nearing
a
very
important
stage
in
our
journey
at
this
time
cholera
was
raging
in
russia
and
was
spread
by
emigrants
going
to
america
in
the
countries
through
which
they
travelled
to
stop
this
danger
measures
were
taken
to
make
emigration
from
russia
more
difficult
than
ever
i
believe
that
at
all
times
the
crossing
of
the
boundary
between
russia
and
germany
was
a
source
of
trouble
to
russians
but
with
a
special
passport
this
was
easily
overcome
when
however
the
traveller
could
not
afford
to
supply
himself
with
one
the
boundary
was
crossed
by
stealth
and
many
amusing
anecdotes
are
told
of
persons
who
crossed
in
some
disguise
often
that
of
a
mujik
who
said
he
was
going
to
the
town
on
the
german
side
to
sell
some
goods
carried
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
the
success
of
the
ruse
when
several
such
tricks
had
been
played
on
the
guards
it
became
very
risky
and
often
when
caught
a
traveller
resorted
to
stratagem
which
is
very
diverting
when
afterwards
described
but
not
so
at
a
time
when
much
depends
on
its
success
some
times
a
paltry
bribe
secured
one
a
safe
passage
and
often
emigrants
were
aided
by
men
who
made
it
their
profession
to
help
them
cross
often
suffering
themselves
to
be
paid
such
sums
for
the
service
that
it
paid
best
to
be
provided
with
a
special
passport
as
i
said
the
difficulties
were
greater
at
the
time
we
were
travelling
and
our
friends
believed
we
had
better
not
attempt
a
stealthy
crossing
and
we
procured
the
necessary
document
to
facilitate
it
we
therefore
expected
little
trouble
but
some
we
thought
there
might
be
for
we
had
heard
some
vague
rumors
to
the
effect
that
a
special
passport
was
not
as
powerful
an
agent
as
it
used
to
be
we
now
prepared
to
enjoy
a
little
lunch
and
before
we
had
time
to
clear
it
away
the
train
stopped
and
we
saw
several
men
in
blue
uniforms
gilt
buttons
and
brass
helmets
if
you
may
call
them
so
on
their
heads
at
his
side
each
wore
a
kind
of
leather
case
attached
to
a
wide
bronze
belt
in
these
cases
they
carried
something
like
a
revolver
and
each
had
besides
a
little
book
with
black
oilcloth
covers
i
can
give
you
no
idea
of
the
impression
these
men
they
were
german
gendarmes
made
on
us
by
saying
they
frightened
us
perhaps
because
their
to
us
impressive
appearance
gave
them
a
stern
look
perhaps
because
they
really
looked
something
more
than
grave
we
were
so
frightened
i
only
know
that
we
were
i
can
see
the
reason
now
clearly
enough
like
all
persons
who
were
used
to
the
tyranny
of
a
russian
policeman
who
practically
ruled
the
ward
or
town
under
his
friendly
protection
and
never
hesitated
to
assert
his
rights
as
holder
of
unlimited
authority
over
his
little
domain
in
that
mild
amiable
manner
so
well
known
to
such
of
his
subjects
as
he
particularly
favored
with
his
vigilant
regard
like
all
such
persons
i
say
we
did
not
could
not
expect
to
receive
any
kind
treatment
at
the
hands
of
a
number
of
officers
especially
as
we
were
in
the
very
act
of
attempting
to
part
with
our
mother
country
of
which
act
to
judge
by
the
pains
it
took
to
make
it
difficult
the
government
did
not
approve
it
was
a
natural
fear
in
us
as
you
can
easily
see
pretty
soon
mother
recovered
herself
and
remembering
that
the
train
stops
for
a
few
minutes
only
was
beginning
to
put
away
the
scattered
articles
hastily
when
a
gendarme
entered
our
car
and
said
we
were
not
to
leave
it
mamma
asked
him
why
but
he
said
nothing
and
left
the
car
another
gendarme
entering
as
he
did
so
he
demanded
where
we
were
going
and
hearing
the
answer
went
out
before
we
had
had
time
to
look
about
at
each
frightened
faces
another
man
a
doctor
as
we
soon
knew
came
in
followed
by
a
third
gendarme
the
doctor
asked
many
questions
about
our
health
and
of
what
nationality
we
were
then
he
asked
about
various
things
as
where
we
were
going
to
if
we
had
tickets
how
much
money
we
had
where
we
came
from
to
whom
we
were
going
making
a
note
of
every
answer
he
received
this
done
he
shook
his
head
with
his
shining
helmet
on
it
and
said
slowly
i
imagined
he
enjoyed
frightening
us
with
these
third
class
tickets
you
can
not
go
to
america
now
because
it
is
forbidden
to
admit
emigrants
into
germany
who
have
not
at
least
second
class
tickets
you
will
have
to
return
to
russia
unless
you
pay
at
the
office
here
to
have
your
tickets
changed
for
second
class
ones
after
a
few
minutes
calculation
and
reference
to
the
notes
he
had
made
he
added
calmly
i
find
you
will
need
two
hundred
rubles
to
get
your
tickets
exchanged
and
as
the
finishing
stroke
to
his
pleasing
communication
added
your
passports
are
of
no
use
at
all
now
because
the
necessary
part
has
to
be
torn
out
whether
you
are
allowed
to
pass
or
not
a
plain
short
speech
he
made
of
it
that
cruel
man
yet
every
word
sounded
in
our
ears
with
an
awful
sound
that
stopped
the
beating
of
our
hearts
for
a
while
sounded
like
the
ringing
of
funeral
bells
to
us
and
yet
without
the
mournfully
sweet
music
those
bells
make
that
they
might
heal
while
they
hurt
we
were
homeless
houseless
and
friendless
in
a
strange
place
we
had
hardly
money
enough
to
last
us
through
the
voyage
for
which
we
had
hoped
and
waited
for
three
long
years
we
had
suffered
much
that
the
reunion
we
longed
for
might
come
about
we
had
prepared
ourselves
to
suffer
more
in
order
to
bring
it
about
and
had
parted
with
those
we
loved
with
places
that
were
dear
to
us
in
spite
of
what
we
passed
through
in
them
never
again
to
see
them
as
we
were
convinced
all
for
the
same
dear
end
with
strong
hopes
and
high
spirits
that
hid
the
sad
parting
we
had
started
on
our
long
journey
and
now
we
were
checked
so
unexpectedly
but
surely
the
blow
coming
from
where
we
little
expected
it
being
as
we
believed
safe
in
that
quarter
and
that
is
why
the
simple
words
had
such
a
frightful
meaning
to
us
we
had
received
a
wound
we
knew
not
how
to
heal
when
mother
had
recovered
enough
to
speak
she
began
to
argue
with
the
gendarme
telling
him
our
story
and
begging
him
to
be
kind
the
children
were
frightened
by
what
they
understood
and
all
but
cried
i
was
only
wondering
what
would
happen
and
wishing
i
could
pour
out
my
grief
in
tears
as
the
others
did
but
when
i
feel
deeply
i
seldom
show
it
in
that
way
and
always
wish
i
could
mother
supplications
and
perhaps
the
children
indirect
ones
had
more
effect
than
i
supposed
they
would
the
officer
was
moved
even
if
he
had
just
said
that
tears
would
not
be
accepted
instead
of
money
and
gave
us
such
kind
advice
that
i
began
to
be
sorry
i
had
thought
him
cruel
for
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
only
doing
his
duty
and
had
no
part
in
our
trouble
that
he
could
be
blamed
for
now
that
i
had
more
kindly
thoughts
of
him
he
said
that
we
would
now
be
taken
to
keebart
a
few
versts
distance
from
verzbolovo
where
one
herr
schidorsky
lived
this
man
he
said
was
well
known
for
miles
around
and
we
were
to
tell
him
our
story
and
ask
him
to
help
us
which
he
probably
would
being
very
kind
a
ray
of
hope
shone
on
each
of
the
frightened
faces
listening
so
attentively
to
this
bearer
of
both
evil
and
happy
tidings
i
for
one
was
very
confident
that
the
good
man
would
help
us
through
our
difficulties
for
i
was
most
unwilling
to
believe
that
we
really
could
continue
our
journey
which
of
us
was
i
like
to
know
we
are
in
keebart
at
the
depot
the
least
important
particular
even
of
that
place
i
noticed
and
remembered
how
the
porter
he
was
an
ugly
grinning
man
carried
in
our
things
and
put
them
away
in
the
southern
corner
of
the
big
room
on
the
floor
how
we
sat
down
on
a
settee
near
them
a
yellow
settee
how
the
glass
roof
let
in
so
much
light
that
we
had
to
shade
our
eyes
because
the
car
had
been
dark
and
we
had
been
crying
how
there
were
only
a
few
people
besides
ourselves
there
and
how
i
began
to
count
them
and
stopped
when
i
noticed
a
sign
over
the
head
of
the
fifth
person
a
little
woman
with
a
red
nose
and
a
pimple
on
it
that
seemed
to
be
staring
at
me
as
much
as
the
eyes
above
them
it
was
so
large
and
round
and
tried
to
read
the
german
with
the
aid
of
the
russian
translation
below
i
noticed
all
this
and
remembered
it
as
if
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world
for
me
to
think
of
no
america
no
gendarme
to
destroy
one
passports
and
speak
of
two
hundred
rubles
as
if
he
were
a
millionaire
no
possibility
of
being
sent
back
to
one
old
home
whether
one
felt
at
all
grateful
for
the
kindness
or
not
nothing
but
that
most
attractive
of
places
full
of
interesting
sights
for
though
i
had
been
so
hopeful
a
little
while
ago
i
felt
quite
discouraged
when
a
man
very
sour
and
grumbling
and
he
was
a
jew
a
son
of
mercy
as
a
certain
song
said
refused
to
tell
mamma
where
schidorsky
lived
i
then
believed
that
the
whole
world
must
have
united
against
us
and
decided
to
show
my
defiant
indifference
by
leaving
the
world
to
be
as
unkind
as
it
pleased
while
i
took
no
interest
in
such
trifles
so
i
let
my
mind
lose
itself
in
a
queer
sort
of
mist
a
something
i
can
not
describe
except
by
saying
it
must
have
been
made
up
of
lazy
inactivity
through
this
mist
i
saw
and
heard
indistinctly
much
that
followed
when
i
think
of
it
now
i
see
how
selfish
it
was
to
allow
myself
to
sink
body
and
mind
in
such
a
sea
of
helpless
laziness
when
i
might
have
done
something
besides
awaiting
the
end
of
that
critical
time
whatever
it
might
be
something
though
what
i
do
not
see
even
now
i
own
but
i
only
studied
the
many
notices
till
i
thought
myself
very
well
acquainted
with
the
german
tongue
and
now
and
then
tried
to
cheer
the
other
children
who
were
still
inclined
to
cry
by
pointing
out
to
them
some
of
the
things
that
interested
me
for
this
faulty
conduct
i
have
no
excuse
to
give
unless
youth
and
the
fact
that
i
was
stunned
with
the
shock
we
had
just
received
will
be
accepted
i
remember
through
that
mist
that
mother
found
schidorsky
home
at
last
but
was
told
she
could
not
see
him
till
a
little
later
that
she
came
back
to
comfort
us
and
found
there
our
former
fellow
passenger
who
had
come
with
us
from
vilna
and
that
he
was
very
indignant
at
the
way
in
which
we
were
treated
and
scolded
and
declared
he
would
have
the
matter
in
all
the
papers
and
said
we
must
be
helped
i
remember
how
mamma
saw
schidorsky
at
last
spoke
to
him
and
then
told
us
word
for
word
what
his
answer
had
been
that
he
would
wait
to
be
asked
to
use
all
his
influence
and
would
lose
a
moment
about
it
and
he
did
for
he
went
out
at
once
on
that
errand
while
his
good
daughter
did
her
best
to
comfort
mamma
with
kind
words
and
tea
i
remember
that
there
was
much
going
to
the
good
man
house
much
hurrying
of
special
messengers
to
and
from
eidtkunen
trembling
inquiries
uncertain
replies
made
hopeful
only
by
the
pitying
encouraging
words
and
manners
of
the
deliverer
for
all
even
the
servants
were
kind
as
good
angels
at
that
place
i
remember
that
another
little
family
there
were
three
were
discovered
by
us
in
the
same
happy
state
as
ourselves
and
like
the
dogs
in
the
fable
who
receiving
care
at
the
hands
of
a
kind
man
sent
their
friends
to
him
for
help
we
sent
them
to
our
helper
i
remember
seeing
night
come
out
of
that
mist
and
bringing
more
trains
and
people
and
noise
than
the
whole
day
we
still
remained
at
the
depot
till
i
felt
sick
and
dizzy
i
remember
wondering
what
kind
of
a
night
it
was
but
not
knowing
how
to
find
out
as
if
i
had
no
senses
i
remember
that
somebody
said
we
were
obliged
to
remain
in
keebart
that
night
and
that
we
set
out
to
find
lodgings
that
the
most
important
things
i
saw
on
the
way
were
the
two
largest
dolls
i
had
ever
seen
carried
by
two
pretty
little
girls
and
a
big
handsome
father
and
a
great
deal
of
gravel
in
the
streets
and
boards
for
the
crossings
i
remember
that
we
found
a
little
room
we
had
to
go
up
four
steps
first
that
we
could
have
for
copecks
with
our
tea
paid
for
in
that
sum
i
remember
through
that
mist
how
i
wondered
what
i
was
sleeping
on
that
night
as
i
wondered
about
the
weather
that
we
really
woke
up
in
the
morning
i
was
so
glad
to
rest
i
had
believed
we
should
never
be
disturbed
again
and
washed
and
dressed
and
breakfasted
and
went
to
the
depot
again
to
be
always
on
hand
i
remember
that
mamma
and
the
father
of
the
little
family
went
at
once
to
the
only
good
man
on
earth
i
thought
so
and
that
the
party
of
three
were
soon
gone
by
the
help
of
some
agent
that
was
slower
for
good
reasons
in
helping
us
i
remember
that
mamma
came
to
us
soon
after
and
said
that
herr
schidorsky
had
told
her
to
ask
the
postmeister
some
high
official
there
for
a
pass
to
eidtkunen
and
there
she
should
speak
herself
to
our
protector
older
brother
who
could
help
us
by
means
of
his
great
power
among
the
officers
of
high
rank
that
she
returned
in
a
few
hours
and
told
us
the
two
brothers
were
equal
in
kindness
for
the
older
one
too
said
he
would
not
wait
to
be
asked
to
do
his
best
for
us
i
remember
that
another
day
long
passed
behind
the
mist
and
we
were
still
in
that
dreadful
noisy
tiresome
depot
with
no
change
till
we
went
to
spend
the
night
at
herr
schidorsky
because
they
let
us
go
anywhere
else
on
the
way
there
i
remember
i
saw
something
marvellous
queer
little
wooden
sticks
stuck
on
the
lines
where
clothes
hung
for
some
purpose
i
did
think
it
was
for
drying
because
you
know
i
always
saw
things
hung
up
on
fences
and
gates
for
such
purposes
the
queer
things
turned
out
to
be
and
i
remember
i
noticed
many
other
things
of
equal
importance
to
our
affairs
till
we
came
to
the
little
house
in
the
garden
here
we
were
received
i
remember
with
much
kindness
and
hospitality
we
had
a
fire
made
for
us
food
and
drink
brought
in
and
a
servant
was
always
inquiring
whether
anything
more
could
be
done
for
our
comfort
i
remember
still
through
that
misty
veil
what
a
pleasant
evening
we
passed
talking
over
what
had
so
far
happened
and
wondering
what
would
come
i
must
have
talked
like
one
lost
in
a
thick
fog
groping
carefully
but
had
i
been
shut
up
mentally
in
a
tower
nothing
else
could
pierce
the
sense
of
gratitude
that
naturally
sprung
from
the
kindness
that
surrounded
us
must
have
would
have
found
a
passage
for
itself
to
the
deepest
cavities
of
the
heart
yes
though
all
my
senses
were
dulled
by
what
had
passed
over
us
so
lately
i
was
yet
aware
of
the
deepest
sense
of
thankfulness
one
can
ever
feel
i
was
aware
of
something
like
the
sweet
presence
of
angels
in
the
persons
of
good
schidorsky
and
his
family
oh
that
some
knowledge
of
that
gratitude
might
reach
those
for
whom
we
felt
it
so
keenly
we
all
felt
it
but
the
deepest
emotions
are
so
hard
to
express
i
thought
of
this
as
i
lay
awake
a
little
while
and
said
to
myself
thinking
of
our
benefactor
that
he
was
a
jew
a
true
son
of
mercy
and
i
slept
with
that
thought
and
this
is
the
last
i
remember
seeing
and
feeling
behind
that
mist
of
lazy
inactivity
the
next
morning
i
woke
not
only
from
the
night
sleep
but
from
my
waking
dreaminess
all
the
vapors
dispersed
as
i
went
into
the
pretty
flower
garden
where
the
others
were
already
at
play
and
by
the
time
we
had
finished
a
good
breakfast
served
by
a
dear
servant
girl
i
felt
quite
myself
again
of
course
mamma
hastened
to
herr
schidorsky
as
soon
as
she
could
and
he
sent
her
to
the
postmeister
again
to
ask
him
to
return
the
part
of
our
passports
that
had
been
torn
out
and
without
which
we
could
not
go
on
he
said
he
would
return
them
as
soon
as
he
received
word
from
eidtkunen
so
we
could
only
wait
and
hope
at
last
it
came
and
so
suddenly
that
we
ran
off
to
the
depot
with
hardly
a
hat
on
all
our
heads
or
a
coat
on
our
backs
with
two
men
running
behind
with
our
things
making
it
a
very
ridiculous
sight
we
have
often
laughed
over
it
since
of
course
in
such
a
confusion
we
could
not
say
even
one
word
of
farewell
or
thanks
to
our
deliverers
but
turning
to
see
that
we
were
all
there
i
saw
them
standing
in
the
gate
crying
that
all
was
well
now
and
wishing
us
many
pleasant
things
and
looking
as
if
they
had
been
receiving
all
the
blessings
instead
of
us
i
have
often
thought
they
must
have
purposely
arranged
it
that
we
should
have
to
leave
in
a
hurry
because
they
would
stand
any
expression
of
gratefulness
well
we
just
reached
our
car
in
time
to
see
our
baggage
brought
from
the
office
and
ourselves
inside
when
the
last
bell
rang
then
before
we
could
get
breath
enough
to
utter
more
than
faint
gasps
of
delight
we
were
again
in
eidtkunen
the
gendarmes
came
to
question
us
again
but
when
mother
said
that
we
were
going
to
herr
schidorsky
of
eidtkunen
as
she
had
been
told
to
say
we
were
allowed
to
leave
the
train
i
really
thought
we
were
to
be
the
visitors
of
the
elder
schidorsky
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
an
understanding
between
him
and
the
officers
that
those
claiming
to
be
on
their
way
to
him
were
not
to
be
troubled
at
any
rate
we
had
now
really
crossed
the
forbidden
boundary
we
were
in
germany
there
was
a
terrible
confusion
in
the
where
we
were
directed
to
go
boxes
baskets
bags
valises
and
great
shapeless
things
belonging
to
no
particular
class
were
thrown
about
by
porters
and
other
men
who
sorted
them
and
put
tickets
on
all
but
those
containing
provisions
while
others
were
opened
and
examined
in
haste
at
last
our
turn
came
and
our
things
along
with
those
of
all
other
travellers
were
taken
away
to
be
steamed
and
smoked
and
other
such
processes
gone
through
we
were
told
to
wait
till
notice
should
be
given
us
of
something
else
to
be
done
our
train
would
not
depart
till
nine
in
the
evening
as
usual
i
noticed
all
the
little
particulars
of
the
waiting
room
what
else
could
i
do
with
so
much
time
and
not
even
a
book
to
read
i
could
describe
it
exactly
the
large
square
room
painted
walls
long
tables
with
fruits
and
drinks
of
all
kinds
covering
them
the
white
chairs
carved
settees
beautiful
china
and
cut
glass
showing
through
the
glass
doors
of
the
dressers
and
the
nickel
samovar
which
attracted
my
attention
because
i
had
never
seen
any
but
copper
or
brass
ones
the
best
and
the
worst
of
everything
there
was
a
large
case
full
of
books
it
was
the
best
because
they
were
books
and
all
could
use
them
the
worst
because
they
were
all
german
and
my
studies
in
the
railway
depot
of
keebart
had
not
taught
me
so
much
that
i
should
be
able
to
read
books
in
german
it
was
very
hard
to
see
people
get
those
books
and
enjoy
them
while
i
could
it
was
impossible
to
be
content
with
other
pleasure
and
i
was
when
i
had
almost
finished
counting
the
books
i
noticed
that
mamma
and
the
others
had
made
friends
with
a
family
of
travellers
like
ourselves
frau
gittleman
and
her
five
children
made
very
interesting
companions
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
they
seemed
to
think
that
frau
antin
and
the
four
younger
antins
were
just
as
interesting
perhaps
excepting
in
their
minds
one
of
them
who
must
have
appeared
rather
uninteresting
from
a
habit
she
had
of
looking
about
as
if
always
expecting
to
make
discoveries
but
she
was
interested
if
not
interesting
enough
when
the
oldest
of
the
young
gittlemans
who
was
a
young
gentleman
of
seventeen
produced
some
books
which
she
could
read
then
all
had
a
merry
time
together
reading
talking
telling
the
various
adventures
of
the
journey
and
walking
as
far
as
we
were
allowed
up
and
down
the
long
platform
outside
till
we
were
called
to
go
and
see
if
we
wanted
to
see
how
our
things
were
being
made
fit
for
further
travel
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
they
managed
to
have
anything
left
to
return
to
us
after
all
the
processes
of
airing
and
smoking
and
steaming
and
other
assaults
on
supposed
germs
of
the
dreaded
cholera
had
been
done
with
the
pillows
even
being
ripped
open
to
be
steamed
all
this
was
interesting
but
we
were
rather
disagreeably
surprised
when
a
bill
for
these
services
had
to
be
paid
the
gittlemans
we
found
were
to
keep
us
company
for
some
time
at
the
expected
hour
we
all
tried
to
find
room
in
a
car
indicated
by
the
conductor
we
tried
but
could
only
find
enough
space
on
the
floor
for
our
baggage
on
which
we
made
believe
sitting
comfortably
for
now
we
were
obliged
to
exchange
the
comparative
comforts
of
a
third
class
passenger
train
for
the
certain
discomforts
of
a
fourth
class
one
there
were
only
four
narrow
benches
in
the
whole
car
and
about
twice
as
many
people
were
already
seated
on
these
as
they
were
probably
supposed
to
accommodate
all
other
space
to
the
last
inch
was
crowded
by
passengers
or
their
luggage
it
was
very
hot
and
close
and
altogether
uncomfortable
and
still
at
every
new
station
fresh
passengers
came
crowding
in
and
actually
made
room
spare
as
it
was
for
themselves
it
became
so
terrible
that
all
glared
madly
at
the
conductor
as
he
allowed
more
people
to
come
into
that
prison
and
trembled
at
the
announcement
of
every
station
i
can
not
see
even
now
how
the
officers
could
allow
such
a
thing
it
was
really
dangerous
the
most
remarkable
thing
was
the
of
the
poor
passengers
few
showed
a
sour
face
even
not
a
man
used
any
strong
language
audibly
at
least
they
smiled
at
each
other
as
if
they
meant
to
say
i
am
having
a
good
time
so
are
you
are
you
young
gittleman
was
very
gallant
and
so
cheerful
that
he
attracted
everybody
attention
he
told
stories
laughed
and
made
us
unwilling
to
be
outdone
during
one
of
his
narratives
he
produced
a
pretty
memorandum
book
that
pleased
one
of
us
very
much
and
that
pleasing
gentleman
at
once
presented
it
to
her
she
has
kept
it
since
in
memory
of
the
giver
and
in
the
right
place
i
could
tell
more
about
that
matter
very
interesting
i
have
given
so
much
space
to
the
description
of
that
one
adventures
because
i
remember
it
so
distinctly
with
all
its
discomforts
and
the
contrast
of
our
kindly
dispositions
at
length
that
dreadful
night
passed
and
at
dawn
about
half
the
passengers
left
all
at
once
there
was
such
a
sigh
of
relief
and
a
stretching
of
cramped
limbs
as
can
only
be
imagined
as
the
remaining
passengers
inhaled
the
fresh
cold
air
of
dewy
dawn
it
was
almost
worth
the
previous
suffering
to
experience
the
pleasure
of
relief
that
followed
all
day
long
we
travelled
in
the
same
train
sleeping
resting
eating
and
wishing
to
get
out
but
the
train
stopped
for
a
very
short
time
at
the
many
stations
and
all
the
difference
that
made
to
us
was
that
pretty
girls
passed
through
the
cars
with
little
bark
baskets
filled
with
fruit
and
flowers
hardly
fresher
or
prettier
than
their
bearers
who
generally
sold
something
to
our
young
companion
for
he
never
wearied
of
entertaining
us
other
interests
there
were
none
the
scenery
was
nothing
unusual
only
towns
depots
roads
fields
little
country
houses
with
barns
and
cattle
and
poultry
all
such
as
we
were
well
acquainted
with
if
something
new
did
appear
it
was
passed
before
one
could
get
a
good
look
at
it
the
most
pleasing
sights
were
little
barefoot
children
waving
their
aprons
or
hats
as
we
eagerly
watched
for
them
because
that
reminded
us
of
our
doing
the
same
thing
when
we
saw
the
passenger
trains
in
the
country
we
used
to
wonder
whether
we
should
ever
do
so
again
towards
evening
we
came
into
berlin
i
grow
dizzy
even
now
when
i
think
of
our
whirling
through
that
city
it
seemed
we
were
going
faster
and
faster
all
the
time
but
it
was
only
the
whirl
of
trains
passing
in
opposite
directions
and
close
to
us
that
made
it
seem
so
the
sight
of
crowds
of
people
such
as
we
had
never
seen
before
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
and
out
of
great
depots
that
danced
past
us
helped
to
make
it
more
so
strange
sights
splendid
buildings
shops
people
and
animals
all
mingled
in
one
great
confused
mass
of
a
disposition
to
continually
move
in
a
great
hurry
wildly
with
no
other
aim
but
to
make
one
head
go
round
and
round
in
following
its
dreadful
motions
round
and
round
went
my
head
it
was
nothing
but
trains
depots
crowds
crowds
depots
trains
again
and
again
with
no
beginning
no
end
only
a
mad
dance
faster
and
faster
we
go
faster
still
and
the
noise
increases
with
the
speed
bells
whistles
hammers
locomotives
shrieking
madly
voices
peddlers
cries
horses
hoofs
dogs
barking
all
united
in
doing
their
best
to
drown
every
other
sound
but
their
own
and
made
such
a
deafening
uproar
in
the
attempt
that
nothing
could
keep
it
out
whirl
noise
dance
uproar
will
it
last
forever
i
so
o
how
my
head
aches
and
oh
those
people
will
be
run
over
stop
the
train
they
thank
goodness
nobody
is
hurt
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
train
passing
right
through
the
middle
of
a
city
up
in
the
air
it
seems
oh
dear
it
no
use
thinking
my
head
spins
so
right
through
the
business
streets
why
who
ever
i
must
have
lived
through
a
century
of
this
terrible
motion
and
din
and
unheard
of
roads
for
trains
and
confused
thinking
but
at
length
everything
began
to
take
a
more
familiar
appearance
again
the
noise
grew
less
the
roads
more
secluded
and
by
degrees
we
recognized
the
dear
peaceful
country
now
we
could
think
of
berlin
or
rather
what
we
had
seen
of
it
more
calmly
and
wonder
why
it
made
such
an
impression
i
see
now
we
had
never
seen
so
large
a
city
before
and
were
not
prepared
to
see
such
sights
bursting
upon
us
so
suddenly
as
that
it
was
like
allowing
a
blind
man
to
see
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
all
at
once
our
little
plotzk
and
even
the
larger
cities
we
had
passed
through
compared
to
berlin
about
the
same
as
total
darkness
does
to
great
brilliancy
of
light
in
a
great
lonely
field
opposite
a
solitary
wooden
house
within
a
large
yard
our
train
pulled
up
at
last
and
a
conductor
commanded
the
passengers
to
make
haste
and
get
out
he
need
not
have
told
us
to
hurry
we
were
glad
enough
to
be
free
again
after
such
a
long
imprisonment
in
the
uncomfortable
car
all
rushed
to
the
door
we
breathed
more
freely
in
the
open
field
but
the
conductor
did
not
wait
for
us
to
enjoy
our
freedom
he
hurried
us
into
the
one
large
room
which
made
up
the
house
and
then
into
the
yard
here
a
great
many
men
and
women
dressed
in
white
received
us
the
women
attending
to
the
women
and
girls
of
the
passengers
and
the
men
to
the
others
this
was
another
scene
of
bewildering
confusion
parents
losing
their
children
and
little
ones
crying
baggage
being
thrown
together
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
heedless
of
contents
which
suffered
in
consequence
those
germans
shouting
commands
always
accompanied
with
quick
quick
the
confused
passengers
obeying
all
orders
like
meek
children
only
questioning
now
and
then
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
them
and
no
wonder
if
in
some
minds
stories
arose
of
people
being
captured
by
robbers
murderers
and
the
like
here
we
had
been
taken
to
a
lonely
place
where
only
that
house
was
to
be
seen
our
things
were
taken
away
our
friends
separated
from
us
a
man
came
to
inspect
us
as
if
to
ascertain
our
full
value
strange
looking
people
driving
us
about
like
dumb
animals
helpless
and
unresisting
children
we
could
not
see
crying
in
a
way
that
suggested
terrible
things
ourselves
driven
into
a
little
room
where
a
great
kettle
was
boiling
on
a
little
stove
our
clothes
taken
off
our
bodies
rubbed
with
a
slippery
substance
that
might
be
any
bad
thing
a
shower
of
warm
water
let
down
on
us
without
warning
again
driven
to
another
little
room
where
we
sit
wrapped
in
woollen
blankets
till
large
coarse
bags
are
brought
in
their
contents
turned
out
and
we
see
only
a
cloud
of
steam
and
hear
the
orders
to
dress
ourselves
quick
quick
or
else
we
miss
something
we
can
not
hear
we
are
forced
to
pick
out
our
clothes
from
among
all
the
others
with
the
steam
blinding
us
we
choke
cough
entreat
the
women
to
give
us
time
they
persist
quick
quick
or
you
miss
the
train
oh
so
we
really
wo
be
murdered
they
are
only
making
us
ready
for
the
continuing
of
our
journey
cleaning
us
of
all
suspicions
of
dangerous
germs
thank
god
assured
by
the
word
train
we
manage
to
dress
ourselves
after
a
fashion
and
the
man
comes
again
to
inspect
us
all
is
right
and
we
are
allowed
to
go
into
the
yard
to
find
our
friends
and
our
luggage
both
are
difficult
tasks
the
second
even
harder
imagine
all
the
things
of
some
hundreds
of
people
making
a
journey
like
ours
being
mostly
unpacked
and
mixed
together
in
one
sad
heap
it
was
disheartening
but
done
at
last
was
the
task
of
collecting
our
belongings
and
we
were
marched
into
the
big
room
again
here
on
the
bare
floor
in
a
ring
sat
some
polish
men
and
women
singing
some
hymn
in
their
own
tongue
and
making
more
noise
than
music
we
were
obliged
to
stand
and
await
further
orders
the
few
seats
being
occupied
and
the
great
door
barred
and
locked
we
were
in
a
prison
and
again
felt
some
doubts
then
a
man
came
in
and
called
the
passengers
names
and
when
they
answered
they
were
made
to
pay
two
marcs
each
for
the
pleasant
bath
we
had
just
been
forced
to
take
another
half
hour
and
our
train
arrived
the
door
was
opened
and
we
rushed
out
into
the
field
glad
to
get
back
even
to
the
fourth
class
car
we
had
lost
sight
of
the
gittlemans
who
were
going
a
different
way
now
and
to
our
regret
had
even
said
or
thanked
them
for
their
kindness
after
the
preceding
night
of
wakefulness
and
discomfort
the
weary
day
in
the
train
the
dizzy
whirl
through
berlin
the
fright
we
had
from
the
rough
proceedings
of
the
germans
and
all
the
strange
experiences
of
the
place
we
just
escaped
after
all
this
we
needed
rest
but
to
get
it
was
impossible
for
all
but
the
youngest
children
if
we
had
borne
great
discomforts
on
the
night
before
we
were
suffering
now
i
had
thought
anything
worse
impossible
worse
it
was
now
the
car
was
even
more
crowded
and
people
gasped
for
breath
people
sat
in
strangers
laps
only
glad
of
that
the
floor
was
so
thickly
lined
that
the
conductor
could
not
pass
and
the
tickets
were
passed
to
him
from
hand
to
hand
all
were
more
worn
out
and
that
did
not
mend
their
dispositions
they
could
not
help
falling
asleep
and
colliding
with
someone
nodding
head
which
called
out
angry
mutterings
and
growls
some
fell
off
their
seats
and
caused
a
great
commotion
by
rolling
over
on
the
sleepers
on
the
floor
and
in
spite
of
my
own
sleepiness
and
weariness
i
had
many
quiet
laughs
by
myself
as
i
watched
the
funny
actions
of
the
poor
travellers
not
until
very
late
did
i
fall
asleep
i
with
the
rest
missed
the
pleasant
company
of
our
friends
the
gittlemans
and
thought
about
them
as
i
sat
perched
on
a
box
with
an
old
man
knees
for
the
back
of
my
seat
another
man
head
continually
striking
my
right
shoulder
a
dozen
or
so
arms
being
tossed
restlessly
right
in
front
of
my
face
and
as
many
legs
holding
me
a
fast
prisoner
so
that
i
could
only
try
to
keep
my
seat
against
all
the
assaults
of
the
sleepers
who
tried
in
vain
to
make
their
positions
more
comfortable
it
was
all
so
comical
in
spite
of
all
the
inconveniences
that
i
tried
hard
not
to
laugh
out
loud
till
i
too
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
very
early
in
the
morning
by
something
chilling
and
uncomfortable
on
my
face
like
raindrops
coming
down
irregularly
i
found
it
was
a
neighbor
of
mine
eating
cheese
who
was
dropping
bits
on
my
face
so
i
began
the
day
with
a
laugh
at
the
funny
apologies
but
could
not
find
much
more
fun
in
the
world
on
account
of
the
cold
and
the
pain
of
every
limb
it
was
very
miserable
till
some
breakfast
cheered
me
up
a
little
about
eight
we
reached
hamburg
again
there
was
a
gendarme
to
ask
questions
look
over
the
tickets
and
give
directions
but
all
the
time
he
kept
a
distance
from
those
passengers
who
came
from
russia
all
for
fear
of
the
cholera
we
had
noticed
before
how
people
were
afraid
to
come
near
us
but
since
that
memorable
bath
in
berlin
and
all
the
steaming
and
smoking
of
our
things
it
seemed
unnecessary
we
were
marched
up
to
the
strangest
sort
of
vehicle
one
could
think
of
it
was
a
something
i
do
know
any
name
for
though
a
little
like
an
express
wagon
at
that
time
i
had
never
seen
such
a
high
narrow
long
thing
so
high
that
the
women
and
girls
could
climb
up
without
the
men
help
and
great
difficulty
so
narrow
that
two
persons
could
not
sit
comfortably
side
by
side
and
so
long
that
it
took
me
some
time
to
move
my
eyes
from
the
rear
end
where
the
baggage
was
to
the
front
where
the
driver
sat
when
all
had
settled
down
at
last
there
were
a
number
besides
ourselves
the
two
horses
started
off
very
fast
in
spite
of
their
heavy
load
through
noisy
strange
looking
streets
they
took
us
where
many
people
walked
or
ran
or
rode
many
splendid
houses
stone
and
brick
and
showy
shops
they
passed
much
that
was
very
strange
to
us
we
saw
and
little
we
knew
anything
about
there
a
little
cart
loaded
with
bottles
or
tin
cans
drawn
by
a
goat
or
a
dog
sometimes
two
attracted
our
attention
sometimes
it
was
only
a
nurse
carrying
a
child
in
her
arms
that
seemed
interesting
from
the
strange
dress
often
it
was
some
article
displayed
in
a
shop
window
or
door
or
the
usually
smiling
owner
standing
in
the
doorway
that
called
for
our
notice
not
that
there
was
anything
really
unusual
in
many
of
these
things
but
a
certain
air
of
foreignness
which
sometimes
was
very
vague
surrounded
everything
that
passed
before
our
interested
gaze
as
the
horses
hastened
on
the
strangest
sight
of
all
we
saw
as
we
came
into
the
still
noisier
streets
something
like
a
such
as
we
had
seen
in
vilna
for
the
first
time
except
that
it
was
open
on
both
sides
in
most
cases
but
without
any
horses
came
flying
really
flying
past
us
for
we
stared
and
looked
it
all
over
and
above
and
under
and
rubbed
our
eyes
and
asked
of
one
another
what
we
saw
and
nobody
could
find
what
it
was
that
made
the
thing
go
and
go
it
did
one
after
another
faster
than
we
with
nothing
to
move
it
why
what
that
we
kept
exclaiming
really
do
you
see
anything
that
makes
it
go
i
sure
i
do
then
i
ventured
the
highly
probable
suggestion
perhaps
it
the
fat
man
in
the
gray
coat
and
hat
with
silver
buttons
i
guess
he
pushes
it
noticed
one
in
front
on
every
one
of
them
holding
on
to
that
shining
thing
and
i
sure
this
was
as
wise
a
solution
of
the
mystery
as
anyone
could
give
except
the
driver
who
laughed
to
himself
and
his
horses
over
our
surprise
and
wonder
at
nothing
he
could
see
to
cause
it
but
we
could
understand
his
explanation
though
we
always
got
along
very
easily
with
the
germans
and
not
until
much
later
did
we
know
that
those
wonderful
things
with
only
a
fat
man
to
move
them
were
electric
cars
the
sightseeing
was
not
all
on
our
side
i
noticed
many
people
stopping
to
look
at
us
as
if
amused
though
most
passed
by
as
though
used
to
such
sights
we
did
make
a
queer
appearance
all
in
a
long
row
up
above
people
heads
in
fact
we
looked
like
a
flock
of
giant
fowls
roosting
only
wide
awake
suddenly
when
everything
interesting
seemed
at
an
end
we
all
recollected
how
long
it
was
since
we
had
started
on
our
funny
ride
hours
we
thought
and
still
the
horses
ran
now
we
rode
through
quieter
streets
where
there
were
fewer
shops
and
more
wooden
houses
still
the
horses
seemed
to
have
but
just
started
i
looked
over
our
perch
again
something
made
me
think
of
a
description
i
had
read
of
criminals
being
carried
on
long
journeys
in
uncomfortable
things
like
this
well
it
was
strange
this
long
long
drive
the
conveyance
no
word
of
explanation
and
all
though
going
different
ways
being
packed
off
together
we
were
strangers
the
driver
knew
it
he
might
take
us
anywhere
how
could
we
tell
i
was
frightened
again
as
in
berlin
the
faces
around
me
confessed
the
same
the
streets
became
quieter
still
no
shops
only
little
houses
hardly
any
people
passing
now
we
cross
many
railway
tracks
and
i
can
hear
the
sea
not
very
distant
there
are
many
trees
now
by
the
roadside
and
the
wind
whistles
through
their
branches
the
wheels
and
hoofs
make
a
great
noise
on
the
stones
the
roar
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
among
the
branches
have
an
unfriendly
sound
the
horses
never
weary
still
they
run
there
are
no
houses
now
in
view
save
now
and
then
a
solitary
one
far
away
i
can
see
the
ocean
oh
it
is
stormy
the
dark
waves
roll
inward
the
white
foam
flies
high
in
the
air
deep
sounds
come
from
it
the
wheels
and
hoofs
make
a
great
noise
the
wind
is
stronger
and
says
do
you
hear
the
sea
and
the
roar
threatens
the
sea
threatens
and
the
wind
bids
me
hear
it
and
the
hoofs
and
the
wheels
repeat
the
command
and
so
do
the
trees
by
gestures
yes
we
are
frightened
we
are
very
still
some
polish
women
over
there
have
fallen
asleep
and
the
rest
of
us
look
such
a
picture
of
woe
and
yet
so
funny
it
is
a
sight
to
see
and
remember
at
last
at
last
those
unwearied
horses
have
stopped
where
in
front
of
a
brick
building
the
only
one
on
a
large
broad
street
where
only
the
trees
and
in
the
distance
the
passing
trains
can
be
seen
nothing
else
the
ocean
too
is
shut
out
all
were
helped
off
the
baggage
put
on
the
sidewalk
and
then
taken
up
again
and
carried
into
the
building
where
the
passengers
were
ordered
to
go
on
the
left
side
of
the
little
corridor
was
a
small
office
where
a
man
sat
before
a
desk
covered
with
papers
these
he
pushed
aside
when
we
entered
and
called
us
in
one
by
one
except
of
course
children
as
usual
many
questions
were
asked
the
new
ones
being
about
our
tickets
then
each
person
children
included
had
to
pay
three
marcs
one
for
the
wagon
that
brought
us
over
and
two
for
food
and
lodgings
till
our
various
ships
should
take
us
away
mamma
having
five
to
pay
for
owed
fifteen
marcs
the
little
sum
we
started
with
was
to
last
us
to
the
end
of
the
journey
and
would
have
done
so
if
there
had
been
those
unexpected
bills
to
pay
at
keebart
eidtkunen
berlin
and
now
at
the
office
seeing
how
often
services
were
forced
upon
us
unasked
and
payment
afterwards
demanded
mother
had
begun
to
fear
that
we
should
need
more
money
and
had
sold
some
things
to
a
woman
for
less
than
a
third
of
their
value
in
spite
of
that
so
heavy
was
the
drain
on
the
spare
purse
where
it
had
not
been
expected
she
found
to
her
dismay
that
she
had
only
twelve
marcs
left
to
meet
the
new
bill
the
man
in
the
office
would
believe
it
and
we
were
given
over
in
charge
of
a
woman
in
a
dark
gray
dress
and
long
white
apron
with
a
red
cross
on
her
right
arm
she
led
us
away
and
thoroughly
searched
us
all
as
well
as
our
baggage
that
was
nice
treatment
like
what
we
had
been
receiving
since
our
first
uninterrupted
entrance
into
germany
always
a
call
for
money
always
suspicion
of
our
presence
and
always
rough
orders
and
scowls
of
disapproval
even
at
the
quickest
obedience
and
now
this
outrageous
indignity
we
had
to
bear
it
all
because
we
were
going
to
america
from
a
land
cursed
by
the
dreadful
epidemic
others
besides
ourselves
shared
these
trials
the
last
one
included
if
that
were
any
comfort
which
it
was
not
when
the
woman
reported
the
result
of
the
search
as
being
fruitless
the
man
was
satisfied
and
we
were
ordered
with
the
rest
through
many
more
examinations
and
ceremonies
before
we
should
be
established
under
the
quarantine
for
that
it
was
while
waiting
for
our
turn
to
be
examined
by
the
doctor
i
looked
about
thinking
it
worth
while
to
get
acquainted
with
a
place
where
we
might
be
obliged
to
stay
for
i
knew
not
how
long
the
room
where
we
were
sitting
was
large
with
windows
so
high
up
that
we
could
see
anything
through
them
in
the
middle
stood
several
long
wooden
tables
and
around
these
were
settees
of
the
same
kind
on
the
right
opposite
the
office
was
a
little
room
where
various
things
could
be
bought
of
a
young
man
if
you
had
paid
all
your
money
for
other
things
when
the
doctor
was
through
with
us
he
told
us
to
go
to
number
five
now
was
that
like
in
a
prison
we
walked
up
and
down
a
long
yard
looking
among
a
row
of
low
numbered
doors
for
ours
when
we
heard
an
exclamation
of
oh
esther
how
do
you
happen
to
be
here
and
on
seeing
the
speaker
found
it
to
be
an
old
friend
of
ours
from
plotzk
she
had
gone
long
before
us
but
her
ship
had
arrived
yet
she
was
surprised
to
see
us
because
we
had
had
no
intention
of
going
when
she
went
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
find
a
friend
among
all
the
strangers
she
showed
us
at
once
to
our
new
quarters
and
while
she
talked
to
mamma
i
had
time
to
see
what
they
were
like
it
looked
something
like
a
hospital
only
less
clean
and
comfortable
more
like
the
soldiers
barracks
i
had
seen
i
saw
a
very
large
room
around
whose
walls
were
ranged
rows
of
high
iron
double
bedsteads
with
coarse
sacks
stuffed
with
something
like
matting
and
not
blankets
for
the
only
bedding
except
where
people
used
their
own
there
were
three
windows
almost
touching
the
roof
with
nails
covering
all
the
framework
from
the
ceiling
hung
two
round
gas
lamps
and
almost
under
them
stood
a
little
wooden
table
and
a
settee
the
floor
was
of
stone
here
was
a
pleasant
prospect
we
had
no
idea
how
long
this
unattractive
place
might
be
our
home
our
friend
explained
that
number
five
was
only
for
jewish
women
and
girls
and
the
beds
were
sleeping
rooms
dining
rooms
parlors
and
everything
else
kitchens
excepted
it
seemed
so
for
some
were
lounging
on
the
beds
some
sitting
up
some
otherwise
engaged
and
all
were
talking
and
laughing
and
making
a
great
noise
poor
things
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
in
that
prison
before
mother
had
told
our
friend
of
our
adventures
a
girl
also
a
passenger
who
had
been
walking
in
the
yard
ran
in
and
announced
time
to
go
to
dinner
he
has
come
already
he
we
soon
learned
was
the
overseer
of
the
jewish
special
kitchen
without
whom
the
meals
were
never
taken
all
the
inmates
of
number
five
rushed
out
in
less
than
a
minute
and
i
wondered
why
they
hurried
so
when
we
reached
the
place
that
served
as
dining
room
there
was
hardly
any
room
for
us
now
while
the
dinner
is
being
served
i
will
tell
you
what
i
can
see
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
stood
a
number
of
long
tables
covered
with
white
oilcloth
on
either
side
of
each
table
stood
benches
on
which
all
the
jewish
passengers
were
now
seated
looking
impatiently
at
the
door
with
the
sign
jewish
kitchen
over
it
pretty
soon
a
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
tall
spare
with
a
thin
pointed
beard
and
an
air
of
importance
on
his
face
it
was
he
the
overseer
who
carried
a
large
tin
pail
filled
with
black
bread
cut
into
pieces
of
half
a
pound
each
he
gave
a
piece
to
every
person
the
youngest
child
and
the
biggest
man
alike
and
then
went
into
the
kitchen
and
filled
his
pail
with
soup
and
meat
giving
everybody
a
great
bowl
full
of
soup
and
a
small
piece
of
meat
all
attacked
their
rations
as
soon
as
they
received
them
and
greatly
relished
the
coarse
bread
and
dark
hot
water
they
called
soup
we
could
eat
those
things
and
only
wondered
how
any
one
could
have
such
an
appetite
for
such
a
dinner
we
stopped
wondering
when
our
own
little
store
of
provisions
gave
out
after
dinner
the
people
went
apart
some
going
back
to
their
beds
and
others
to
walk
in
the
yard
or
sit
on
the
settees
there
there
was
no
other
place
to
go
to
the
doors
of
the
prison
were
never
unlocked
except
when
new
passengers
arrived
or
others
left
for
their
ships
the
fences
they
really
were
solid
walls
had
wires
and
nails
on
top
so
that
one
could
even
climb
to
get
a
look
at
the
sea
we
went
back
to
our
quarters
to
talk
over
matters
and
rest
from
our
journey
at
six
the
doctor
came
with
a
clerk
and
standing
before
the
door
bade
all
those
in
the
yard
belonging
to
number
five
assemble
there
and
then
the
roll
was
called
and
everybody
received
a
little
ticket
as
she
answered
to
her
name
with
this
all
went
to
the
kitchen
and
received
two
little
rolls
and
a
large
cup
of
partly
sweetened
tea
this
was
supper
and
breakfast
served
too
in
this
way
was
the
same
any
wonder
that
people
hurried
to
dinner
and
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
always
the
same
thing
no
change
little
by
little
we
became
used
to
the
new
life
though
it
was
hard
to
go
hungry
day
after
day
and
bear
the
discomforts
of
the
common
room
shared
by
so
many
the
hard
beds
we
had
little
bedding
of
our
own
and
the
confinement
to
the
narrow
limits
of
the
yard
and
the
tiresome
sameness
of
the
life
meal
hours
of
course
played
the
most
important
part
while
the
others
had
to
be
filled
up
as
best
we
could
the
weather
was
fine
most
of
the
time
and
that
helped
much
everything
was
an
event
the
arrival
of
fresh
passengers
a
great
one
which
happened
every
day
the
day
when
the
women
were
allowed
to
wash
clothes
by
the
well
was
a
holiday
and
the
few
favorite
girls
who
were
allowed
to
help
in
the
kitchen
were
envied
on
dull
rainy
days
the
man
coming
to
light
the
lamps
at
night
was
an
object
of
pleasure
and
every
one
made
the
best
of
everybody
else
so
when
a
young
man
arrived
who
had
been
to
america
once
before
he
was
looked
up
to
by
every
person
there
as
a
superior
his
stories
of
our
future
home
listened
to
with
delight
and
his
manners
imitated
by
all
as
a
sort
of
fit
preparation
he
was
wanted
everywhere
and
he
made
the
best
of
his
greatness
by
taking
liberties
and
putting
on
great
airs
and
i
afterwards
found
imposing
on
our
ignorance
very
much
but
anything
the
american
did
passed
for
good
except
his
going
away
a
few
days
too
soon
then
a
girl
came
who
was
rather
wanting
a
little
brightness
so
all
joined
in
imposing
upon
her
by
telling
her
a
certain
young
man
was
a
great
professor
whom
all
owed
respect
and
homage
to
and
she
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
express
hers
while
he
used
her
to
his
best
advantage
like
the
willing
slave
she
was
nobody
seemed
to
think
this
unkind
at
all
and
it
really
was
excusable
that
the
poor
prisoners
hungry
for
some
entertainment
should
try
to
make
a
little
fun
when
the
chance
came
besides
the
girl
had
opened
the
temptation
by
asking
who
was
the
handsome
man
in
the
glasses
a
professor
surely
showing
that
she
took
glasses
for
a
sure
sign
of
a
professor
and
professor
for
the
highest
possible
title
of
honor
does
this
excuse
us
the
greatest
event
was
the
arrival
of
some
ship
to
take
some
of
the
waiting
passengers
when
the
gates
were
opened
and
the
lucky
ones
said
good
bye
those
left
behind
felt
hopeless
of
ever
seeing
the
gates
open
for
them
it
was
both
pleasant
and
painful
for
the
strangers
grew
to
be
fast
friends
in
a
day
and
really
rejoiced
in
each
other
fortune
but
the
regretful
envy
could
not
be
helped
either
amid
such
events
as
these
a
day
was
like
a
month
at
least
eight
of
these
we
had
spent
in
quarantine
when
a
great
commotion
was
noticed
among
the
people
of
number
five
and
those
of
the
corresponding
number
in
the
men
division
there
was
a
good
reason
for
it
you
remember
that
it
was
april
and
passover
was
coming
on
in
fact
it
began
that
night
the
great
question
was
would
we
be
able
to
keep
it
exactly
according
to
the
host
of
rules
to
be
obeyed
you
who
know
all
about
the
great
holiday
can
understand
what
the
answer
to
that
question
meant
to
us
think
of
all
the
work
and
care
and
money
it
takes
to
supply
a
family
with
all
the
things
proper
and
necessary
and
you
will
see
that
to
supply
a
few
hundred
was
no
small
matter
now
were
they
going
to
take
care
that
all
was
perfectly
right
and
could
we
trust
them
if
they
promised
or
should
we
be
forced
to
break
any
of
the
laws
that
ruled
the
holiday
all
day
long
there
was
talking
and
questioning
and
debating
and
threatening
that
we
would
rather
starve
than
touch
anything
we
were
not
sure
of
and
we
meant
it
so
some
men
and
women
went
to
the
overseer
to
let
him
know
what
he
had
to
look
out
for
he
assured
them
that
he
would
rather
starve
along
with
us
than
allow
anything
to
be
in
the
least
wrong
still
there
was
more
discussing
and
shaking
of
heads
for
they
were
not
sure
yet
there
was
not
a
crumb
anywhere
to
be
found
because
what
bread
we
received
was
too
precious
for
any
of
it
to
be
wasted
but
the
women
made
a
great
show
of
cleaning
up
number
five
while
they
sighed
and
looked
sad
and
told
one
another
of
the
good
hard
times
they
had
at
home
getting
ready
for
passover
really
hard
as
it
is
when
one
is
used
to
it
from
childhood
it
seems
part
of
the
holiday
and
ca
be
left
out
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
supper
as
on
other
nights
seemed
like
breaking
one
of
the
laws
so
they
tried
hard
to
be
busy
at
night
we
were
called
by
the
overseer
who
tried
to
look
more
important
than
ever
in
his
holiday
clothes
not
his
best
though
to
the
feast
spread
in
one
of
the
unoccupied
rooms
we
were
ready
for
it
and
anxious
enough
we
had
had
neither
bread
nor
matzo
for
dinner
and
were
more
hungry
than
ever
if
that
is
possible
we
now
found
everything
really
prepared
there
were
the
pillows
covered
with
a
spread
new
oilcloth
on
the
newly
scrubbed
tables
some
little
candles
stuck
in
a
basin
of
sand
on
the
for
the
women
and
a
sure
sign
of
a
holiday
both
gas
lamps
burning
only
one
was
used
on
other
nights
happy
to
see
these
things
and
smell
the
supper
we
took
our
places
and
waited
soon
the
cook
came
in
and
filled
some
glasses
with
wine
from
two
bottles
one
yellow
one
red
then
she
gave
to
each
person
exactly
one
and
a
half
matzos
also
some
cold
meat
burned
almost
to
a
coal
for
the
occasion
the
young
man
bless
him
who
had
the
honor
to
perform
the
ceremonies
was
fortunately
for
us
all
one
of
the
passengers
he
felt
for
and
with
us
and
it
happened
just
a
coincidence
that
the
greater
part
of
the
ceremony
escaped
from
his
book
as
he
turned
the
leaves
though
strictly
religious
nobody
felt
in
the
least
guilty
about
it
especially
on
account
of
the
wine
for
when
we
came
to
the
place
where
you
have
to
drink
the
wine
we
found
it
tasted
like
good
vinegar
which
made
us
all
choke
and
gasp
and
one
little
girl
screamed
poison
so
that
all
laughed
and
the
leader
who
tried
to
go
on
broke
down
too
at
the
sight
of
the
wry
faces
he
saw
while
the
overseer
looked
shocked
the
cook
nearly
set
her
gown
on
fire
by
overthrowing
the
candles
with
her
apron
used
to
hide
her
face
and
all
wished
our
master
overseer
had
to
drink
that
wine
all
his
days
think
of
the
same
ceremony
as
it
is
at
home
then
of
this
one
just
described
do
they
even
resemble
each
other
well
the
leader
got
through
amid
much
giggling
and
sly
looks
among
the
girls
who
understood
the
trick
and
frowns
of
the
older
people
who
secretly
blessed
him
for
it
then
half
hungry
all
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
of
food
in
plenty
no
other
dreams
rather
for
the
day
that
brought
the
passover
brought
us
our
own
family
the
most
glorious
news
we
had
been
ordered
to
bring
our
baggage
to
the
office
ordered
to
bring
our
baggage
to
the
office
that
meant
nothing
less
than
that
we
were
going
the
next
day
it
was
just
after
supper
that
we
received
the
welcome
order
oh
who
cared
if
there
was
enough
to
eat
who
cared
for
anything
in
the
whole
world
we
did
it
was
all
joy
and
gladness
and
happy
anticipation
for
us
we
laughed
and
cried
and
hugged
one
another
and
shouted
and
acted
altogether
like
wild
things
yes
we
were
wild
with
joy
and
long
after
the
rest
were
asleep
we
were
whispering
together
and
wondering
how
we
could
keep
quiet
the
whole
night
we
could
sleep
by
any
means
we
were
so
afraid
of
oversleeping
the
great
hour
and
every
little
while
after
we
tried
to
sleep
one
of
us
would
suddenly
think
she
saw
day
at
the
window
and
wake
the
rest
who
also
had
only
been
pretending
to
sleep
while
watching
in
the
dark
for
daylight
when
it
came
it
found
no
watchful
eye
after
all
the
excitement
gave
way
to
fatigue
and
drowsiness
first
then
deep
sleep
completed
its
victory
it
was
eight
when
we
awoke
the
morning
was
cloudy
and
chilly
the
sun
being
too
lazy
to
attend
to
business
now
and
then
it
rained
a
little
too
and
yet
it
was
the
most
beautiful
day
that
had
ever
dawned
on
hamburg
we
enjoyed
everything
offered
for
breakfast
two
matzos
and
two
cups
of
tea
apiece
why
it
was
a
banquet
after
it
came
the
as
we
were
going
soon
as
i
told
you
before
the
strangers
became
fast
friends
in
a
short
time
under
the
circumstances
so
there
was
real
sorrow
at
the
partings
though
the
joy
of
the
fortunate
ones
was
in
a
measure
shared
by
all
about
one
we
did
go
to
dinner
we
could
eat
for
excitement
we
were
called
there
were
three
other
families
an
old
woman
and
a
young
man
among
the
jewish
passengers
who
were
going
with
us
besides
some
polish
people
we
were
all
hurried
through
the
door
we
had
watched
with
longing
for
so
long
and
were
a
little
way
from
it
when
the
old
woman
stopped
short
and
called
on
the
rest
to
wait
we
have
any
matzo
she
cried
in
alarm
where
the
overseer
sure
enough
we
had
forgotten
it
when
we
might
as
well
have
left
one
of
us
behind
we
refused
to
go
calling
for
the
overseer
who
had
promised
to
supply
us
and
the
man
who
had
us
in
charge
grew
angry
and
said
he
would
wait
it
was
a
terrible
situation
for
us
oh
said
the
man
you
can
go
and
get
your
matzo
but
the
boat
wait
for
you
and
he
walked
off
followed
by
the
polish
people
only
we
had
to
decide
at
once
we
looked
at
the
old
woman
she
said
she
was
going
to
start
on
a
dangerous
journey
with
such
a
sin
on
her
soul
then
the
children
decided
they
understood
the
matter
they
cried
and
begged
to
follow
the
party
and
we
did
just
when
we
reached
the
shore
the
cook
came
up
panting
hard
she
brought
us
matzo
how
relieved
we
were
then
we
got
on
a
little
steamer
the
name
is
too
big
for
it
that
was
managed
by
our
conductor
alone
before
we
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
the
shrill
whistle
so
near
us
we
were
landing
in
front
of
a
large
stone
building
once
more
we
were
under
the
command
of
the
gendarme
we
were
ordered
to
go
into
a
big
room
crowded
with
people
and
wait
till
the
name
of
our
ship
was
called
somebody
in
a
little
room
called
a
great
many
queer
names
and
many
passengers
answered
the
call
at
last
we
heard
polynesia
we
passed
in
and
a
great
many
things
were
done
to
our
tickets
before
we
were
directed
to
go
outside
then
to
a
larger
steamer
than
the
one
we
came
in
at
every
step
our
tickets
were
either
stamped
or
punched
or
a
piece
torn
off
of
them
till
we
stepped
upon
the
steamer
deck
then
we
were
ordered
below
it
was
dark
there
and
we
did
like
it
in
a
little
while
we
were
called
up
again
and
then
we
saw
before
us
the
great
ship
that
was
to
carry
us
to
america
i
only
remember
from
that
moment
that
i
had
only
one
care
till
all
became
quiet
not
to
lose
hold
of
my
sister
hand
everything
else
can
be
told
in
one
word
noise
but
when
i
look
back
i
can
see
what
made
it
there
were
sailors
dragging
and
hauling
bundles
and
boxes
from
the
small
boat
into
the
great
ship
shouting
and
thundering
at
their
work
there
were
officers
giving
out
orders
in
loud
voices
like
trumpets
though
they
seemed
to
make
no
effort
there
were
children
crying
and
mothers
hushing
them
and
fathers
questioning
the
officers
as
to
where
they
should
go
there
were
little
boats
and
steamers
passing
all
around
shrieking
and
whistling
terribly
and
there
seemed
to
be
everything
under
heaven
that
had
any
noise
in
it
come
to
help
swell
the
confusion
of
sounds
i
know
that
but
how
we
ever
got
in
that
quiet
place
that
had
the
sign
for
families
over
it
i
do
know
i
think
we
went
around
and
around
long
and
far
before
we
got
there
but
there
we
were
sitting
quietly
on
a
bench
by
the
white
berths
when
the
sailors
brought
our
things
we
got
everything
in
order
for
the
journey
as
soon
as
possible
that
we
might
go
on
deck
to
see
the
starting
but
first
we
had
to
obey
a
sailor
who
told
us
to
come
and
get
dishes
each
person
received
a
plate
a
spoon
and
a
cup
i
wondered
how
we
could
get
along
if
we
had
had
no
things
of
our
own
for
an
hour
or
two
more
there
were
still
many
noises
on
deck
and
many
preparations
made
then
we
went
up
as
most
of
the
passengers
did
what
a
change
in
the
scene
where
there
had
been
noise
and
confusion
before
peace
and
quiet
were
now
all
the
little
boats
and
steamers
had
disappeared
and
the
wharf
was
deserted
on
deck
the
polynesia
everything
was
in
good
order
and
the
officers
walked
about
smoking
their
cigars
as
if
their
work
was
done
only
a
few
sailors
were
at
work
at
the
big
ropes
but
they
did
shout
as
before
the
weather
had
changed
too
for
the
twilight
was
unlike
what
the
day
had
promised
the
sky
was
soft
gray
with
faint
streaks
of
yellow
on
the
horizon
the
air
was
still
and
pleasant
much
warmer
than
it
had
been
all
the
day
and
the
water
was
as
motionless
and
clear
as
a
deep
cool
well
and
everything
was
mirrored
in
it
clearly
this
entire
change
in
the
scene
the
peace
that
encircled
everything
around
us
seemed
to
give
all
the
same
feeling
that
i
know
i
had
i
fancied
that
nature
created
it
especially
for
us
so
that
we
would
be
allowed
in
this
pause
to
think
of
our
situation
all
seemed
to
do
so
all
spoke
in
low
voices
and
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
as
they
gazed
quietly
into
the
smooth
depths
below
or
the
twilight
skies
above
were
they
seeking
an
assurance
perhaps
for
there
was
something
strange
in
the
absence
of
a
crowd
of
friends
on
the
shore
to
cheer
and
salute
and
fill
the
air
with
white
clouds
and
last
farewells
i
found
the
assurance
the
very
stillness
was
a
voice
nature
voice
and
it
spoke
to
the
ocean
and
said
i
entrust
to
you
this
vessel
take
care
of
it
for
it
bears
my
children
with
it
from
one
strange
shore
to
another
more
distant
where
loving
friends
are
waiting
to
embrace
them
after
long
partings
be
gentle
with
your
charge
and
the
ocean
though
seeming
so
still
replied
i
will
obey
my
mistress
i
heard
it
all
and
a
feeling
of
safety
and
protection
came
to
me
and
when
at
last
the
wheels
overhead
began
to
turn
and
clatter
and
the
ripples
on
the
water
told
us
that
the
polynesia
had
started
on
her
journey
which
was
not
noticeable
from
any
other
sign
i
felt
only
a
sense
of
happiness
i
mistrusted
nothing
but
the
old
woman
who
remembered
the
matzo
did
more
than
anybody
else
she
made
great
preparations
for
being
seasick
and
poisoned
the
air
with
garlic
and
onions
when
the
lantern
fixed
in
the
ceiling
had
been
lighted
the
captain
and
the
steward
paid
us
a
visit
they
took
up
our
tickets
and
noticed
all
the
passengers
then
left
then
a
sailor
brought
supper
bread
and
coffee
only
a
few
ate
it
then
all
went
to
bed
though
it
was
very
early
nobody
expected
seasickness
as
soon
as
it
seized
us
all
slept
quietly
the
whole
night
not
knowing
any
difference
between
being
on
land
or
at
sea
about
five
i
woke
up
and
then
i
felt
and
heard
the
sea
a
very
disagreeable
smell
came
from
it
and
i
knew
it
was
disturbed
by
the
rocking
of
the
ship
oh
how
wretched
it
made
us
from
side
to
side
it
went
rocking
rocking
ugh
many
of
the
passengers
are
very
sick
indeed
they
suffer
terribly
we
are
all
awake
now
and
wonder
if
we
too
will
be
so
sick
some
children
are
crying
at
intervals
there
is
nobody
to
comfort
them
all
are
so
miserable
oh
i
am
so
sick
i
dizzy
everything
is
going
round
and
round
before
my
eyes
i
ca
even
begin
to
tell
of
the
suffering
of
the
next
few
hours
then
i
thought
i
would
feel
better
if
i
could
go
on
deck
somehow
i
got
down
we
had
upper
berths
and
supporting
myself
against
the
walls
i
came
on
deck
but
it
was
worse
the
green
water
tossing
up
the
white
foam
rocking
all
around
as
far
as
i
dared
to
look
was
frightful
to
me
then
so
i
crawled
back
as
well
as
i
could
and
nobody
else
tried
to
go
out
by
and
by
the
doctor
and
the
steward
came
the
doctor
asked
each
passenger
if
they
were
well
but
only
smiled
when
all
begged
for
some
medicine
to
take
away
the
dreadful
suffering
to
those
who
suffered
from
anything
besides
seasickness
he
sent
medicine
and
special
food
later
on
his
companion
appointed
one
of
the
men
passengers
for
every
twelve
or
fifteen
to
carry
the
meals
from
the
kitchen
giving
them
cards
to
get
it
with
for
our
group
a
young
german
was
appointed
who
was
making
the
journey
for
the
second
time
with
his
mother
and
sister
we
were
great
friends
with
them
during
the
journey
the
doctor
went
away
soon
leaving
the
sufferers
in
the
same
sad
condition
at
twelve
a
sailor
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
and
the
man
brought
it
large
tin
pails
and
basins
of
soup
meat
cabbage
potatoes
and
pudding
the
last
was
allowed
only
once
a
week
and
almost
all
of
it
was
thrown
away
as
only
a
few
men
ate
the
rest
could
bear
even
the
smell
of
food
it
was
the
same
with
the
supper
at
six
at
three
milk
had
been
brought
for
the
babies
and
brown
bread
a
treat
with
coffee
for
the
rest
but
after
supper
the
daily
allowance
of
fresh
water
was
brought
and
this
soon
disappeared
and
more
called
for
which
was
refused
although
we
lived
on
water
alone
for
a
week
at
last
the
day
was
gone
and
much
we
had
borne
in
it
night
came
but
brought
little
relief
some
did
fall
asleep
and
forgot
suffering
for
a
few
hours
i
was
awake
late
the
ship
was
quieter
and
everything
sadder
than
by
daylight
i
thought
of
all
we
had
gone
through
till
we
had
got
on
board
the
polynesia
of
the
parting
from
all
friends
and
things
we
loved
forever
as
far
as
we
knew
of
the
strange
experience
at
various
strange
places
of
the
kind
friends
who
helped
us
and
the
rough
officers
who
commanded
us
of
the
quarantine
the
hunger
then
the
happy
news
and
the
coming
on
board
of
all
this
i
thought
and
remembered
that
we
were
far
away
from
friends
and
longed
for
them
that
i
might
be
made
well
by
speaking
to
them
and
every
minute
was
making
the
distance
between
us
greater
a
meeting
more
impossible
then
i
remembered
why
we
were
crossing
the
ocean
and
knew
that
it
was
worth
the
price
at
last
the
noise
of
the
wheels
overhead
and
the
dull
roar
of
the
sea
rocked
me
to
sleep
for
a
short
time
only
the
ship
was
tossed
about
more
than
the
day
before
and
the
great
waves
sounded
like
distant
thunder
as
they
beat
against
it
and
rolled
across
the
deck
and
entered
the
cabin
we
found
however
that
we
were
better
though
very
weak
we
managed
to
go
on
deck
in
the
afternoon
when
it
was
calm
enough
a
little
band
was
playing
and
a
few
young
sailors
and
german
girls
tried
even
to
dance
but
it
was
impossible
as
i
sat
in
a
corner
where
no
waves
could
reach
me
holding
on
to
a
rope
i
tried
to
take
in
the
grand
scene
there
was
the
mighty
ocean
i
had
heard
of
only
spreading
out
its
rough
breadth
far
far
around
its
waves
giving
out
deep
angry
tones
and
throwing
up
walls
of
spray
into
the
air
there
was
the
sky
like
the
sea
full
of
ridges
of
darkest
clouds
bending
to
meet
the
waves
and
following
their
motions
and
frowning
and
threatening
and
there
was
the
polynesia
in
the
midst
of
this
world
of
gloom
and
anger
and
distance
i
saw
these
but
indistinctly
not
half
comprehending
the
wonderful
picture
for
the
suffering
had
left
me
dull
and
tired
out
i
only
knew
that
i
was
sad
and
everybody
else
was
the
same
another
day
gone
and
we
congratulate
one
another
that
seasickness
lasted
only
one
day
with
us
so
we
go
to
sleep
oh
the
sad
mistake
for
six
days
longer
we
remain
in
our
berths
miserable
and
unable
to
eat
it
is
a
long
fast
hardly
interrupted
during
which
we
know
that
the
weather
is
unchanged
the
sky
dark
the
sea
stormy
on
the
eighth
day
out
we
are
again
able
to
be
about
i
went
around
everywhere
exploring
every
corner
and
learning
much
from
the
sailors
but
i
never
remembered
the
names
of
the
various
things
i
asked
about
they
were
so
many
and
some
german
names
hard
to
learn
we
all
made
friends
with
the
captain
and
other
officers
and
many
of
the
passengers
the
little
band
played
regularly
on
certain
days
and
the
sailors
and
girls
had
a
good
many
dances
though
often
they
were
swept
by
a
wave
across
the
deck
quite
out
of
time
the
children
were
allowed
to
play
on
deck
but
carefully
watched
still
the
weather
continued
the
same
or
changing
slightly
but
i
was
able
now
to
see
all
the
grandeur
of
my
surroundings
notwithstanding
the
weather
oh
what
solemn
thoughts
i
had
how
deeply
i
felt
the
greatness
the
power
of
the
scene
the
immeasurable
distance
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
huge
billows
forever
changing
their
shapes
now
only
a
wavy
and
rolling
plain
now
a
chain
of
great
mountains
coming
and
going
farther
away
then
a
town
in
the
distance
perhaps
with
spires
and
towers
and
buildings
of
gigantic
dimensions
and
mostly
a
vast
mass
of
uncertain
shapes
knocking
against
each
other
in
fury
and
seething
and
foaming
in
their
anger
the
grey
sky
with
its
mountains
of
gloomy
clouds
flying
moving
with
the
waves
as
it
seemed
very
near
them
the
absence
of
any
object
besides
the
one
ship
and
the
deep
solemn
groans
of
the
sea
sounding
as
if
all
the
voices
of
the
world
had
been
turned
into
sighs
and
then
gathered
into
that
one
mournful
sound
so
deeply
did
i
feel
the
presence
of
these
things
that
the
feeling
became
one
of
awe
both
painful
and
sweet
and
stirring
and
warming
and
deep
and
calm
and
grand
i
thought
of
tempests
and
shipwreck
of
lives
lost
treasures
destroyed
and
all
the
tales
i
had
heard
of
the
misfortunes
at
sea
and
knew
i
had
never
before
had
such
a
clear
idea
of
them
i
tried
to
realize
that
i
saw
only
a
part
of
an
immense
whole
and
then
my
feelings
were
terrible
in
their
force
i
was
afraid
of
thinking
then
but
could
not
stop
it
my
mind
would
go
on
working
till
i
was
overcome
by
the
strength
and
power
that
was
greater
than
myself
what
i
did
at
such
times
i
do
not
know
i
must
have
been
dazed
after
a
while
i
could
sit
quietly
and
gaze
far
away
then
i
would
imagine
myself
all
alone
on
the
ocean
and
robinson
crusoe
was
very
real
to
me
i
was
alone
sometimes
i
was
aware
of
no
human
presence
i
was
conscious
only
of
sea
and
sky
and
something
i
did
not
understand
and
as
i
listened
to
its
solemn
voice
i
felt
as
if
i
had
found
a
friend
and
knew
that
i
loved
the
ocean
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
within
as
well
as
without
a
part
of
myself
and
i
wondered
how
i
had
lived
without
it
and
if
i
could
ever
part
with
it
the
ocean
spoke
to
me
in
other
besides
mournful
or
angry
tones
i
loved
even
the
angry
voice
but
when
it
became
soothing
i
could
hear
a
sweet
gentle
accent
that
reached
my
soul
rather
than
my
ear
perhaps
i
imagined
it
i
do
not
know
what
was
real
and
what
imaginary
blended
in
one
but
i
heard
and
felt
it
and
at
such
moments
i
wished
i
could
live
on
the
sea
forever
and
thought
that
the
sight
of
land
would
be
very
unwelcome
to
me
i
did
not
want
to
be
near
any
person
alone
with
the
ocean
forever
that
was
my
wish
leading
a
quiet
life
the
same
every
day
and
thinking
such
thoughts
feeling
such
emotions
the
days
were
very
long
i
do
not
know
how
the
others
passed
the
time
because
i
was
so
lost
in
my
meditations
but
when
the
sky
would
smile
for
awhile
when
a
little
sunlight
broke
a
path
for
itself
through
the
heavy
clouds
which
disappeared
as
though
frightened
and
when
the
sea
looked
more
friendly
and
changed
its
color
to
match
the
heavens
which
were
higher
up
then
we
would
sit
on
deck
together
and
laugh
for
mere
happiness
as
we
talked
of
the
nearing
meeting
which
the
unusual
fairness
of
the
weather
seemed
to
bring
nearer
sometimes
at
such
minutes
of
sunshine
and
gladness
a
few
birds
would
be
seen
making
their
swift
journey
to
some
point
we
did
not
know
of
sometimes
among
the
light
clouds
then
almost
touching
the
surface
of
the
waves
how
shall
i
tell
you
what
we
felt
at
the
sight
the
birds
were
like
old
friends
to
us
and
brought
back
many
memories
which
seemed
very
old
though
really
fresh
all
felt
sadder
when
the
distance
became
too
great
for
us
to
see
the
dear
little
friends
though
it
was
not
for
a
long
time
after
their
first
appearance
we
used
to
watch
for
them
and
often
mistook
the
clouds
for
birds
and
were
thus
disappointed
when
they
did
come
how
envious
we
were
of
their
wings
it
was
a
new
thought
to
me
that
the
birds
had
more
power
than
man
in
this
way
the
days
went
by
i
thought
my
thoughts
each
day
as
i
watched
the
scene
hoping
to
see
a
beautiful
sunset
some
day
i
never
did
to
my
disappointment
and
each
night
as
i
lay
in
my
berth
waiting
for
sleep
i
wished
i
might
be
able
even
to
hope
for
the
happiness
of
a
after
this
had
been
ended
yet
when
on
the
twelfth
day
after
leaving
hamburg
the
captain
announced
that
we
should
see
land
before
long
i
rejoiced
as
much
as
anybody
else
we
were
so
excited
with
expectation
that
nothing
else
was
heard
but
the
talk
of
the
happy
arrival
now
so
near
some
were
even
willing
to
stay
up
at
night
to
be
the
first
ones
to
see
the
shores
of
america
it
was
therefore
a
great
disappointment
when
the
captain
said
in
the
evening
that
we
would
not
reach
boston
as
soon
as
he
expected
on
account
of
the
weather
a
dense
fog
set
in
at
night
and
grew
heavier
and
heavier
until
the
polynesia
was
closely
walled
in
by
it
and
we
could
just
see
from
one
end
of
the
deck
to
the
other
the
signal
lanterns
were
put
up
the
passengers
were
driven
to
their
berths
by
the
cold
and
damp
the
cabin
doors
closed
and
discomfort
reigned
everywhere
but
the
excitement
of
the
day
had
tired
us
out
and
we
were
glad
to
forget
disappointment
in
sleep
in
the
morning
it
was
still
foggy
but
we
could
see
a
little
way
around
it
was
very
strange
to
have
the
boundless
distance
made
so
narrow
and
i
felt
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
all
day
long
we
shivered
with
cold
and
hardly
left
the
cabin
at
last
it
was
night
once
more
and
we
in
our
berths
but
nobody
slept
the
sea
had
been
growing
rougher
during
the
day
and
at
night
the
ship
began
to
pitch
as
it
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
then
it
grew
worse
everything
in
our
cabin
was
rolling
on
the
floor
clattering
and
dinning
dishes
were
broken
into
little
bits
that
flew
about
from
one
end
to
the
other
bedding
from
upper
berths
nearly
stifled
the
people
in
the
lower
ones
some
fell
out
of
their
berths
but
it
was
not
at
all
funny
as
the
ship
turned
to
one
side
the
passengers
were
violently
thrown
against
that
side
of
the
berths
and
some
boards
gave
way
and
clattered
down
to
the
floor
when
it
tossed
on
the
other
side
we
could
see
the
little
windows
almost
touch
the
water
and
closed
the
shutters
to
keep
out
the
sight
the
children
cried
everybody
groaned
and
sailors
kept
coming
in
to
pick
up
the
things
on
the
floor
and
carry
them
away
this
made
the
confusion
less
but
not
the
alarm
above
all
sounds
rose
the
fog
horn
it
never
stopped
the
long
night
through
and
oh
how
sad
it
sounded
it
pierced
every
heart
and
made
us
afraid
now
and
then
some
ship
far
away
would
answer
like
a
weak
echo
sometimes
we
noticed
that
the
wheels
were
still
and
we
knew
that
the
ship
had
stopped
this
frightened
us
more
than
ever
for
we
imagined
the
worst
reasons
for
it
it
was
day
again
and
a
little
calmer
we
slept
now
till
the
afternoon
then
we
saw
that
the
fog
had
become
much
thinner
and
later
on
we
even
saw
a
ship
but
indistinctly
another
night
passed
and
the
day
that
followed
was
pretty
fair
and
towards
evening
the
sky
was
almost
cloudless
the
captain
said
we
should
have
no
more
rough
weather
for
now
we
were
really
near
boston
oh
how
hard
it
was
to
wait
for
the
happy
day
somebody
brought
the
news
that
we
should
land
in
the
afternoon
we
did
believe
it
so
he
said
that
the
steward
had
ordered
a
great
pudding
full
of
raisins
for
supper
that
day
as
a
sure
sign
that
it
was
the
last
on
board
we
remembered
the
pudding
but
did
believe
in
its
meaning
i
do
think
we
slept
that
night
after
all
the
suffering
of
our
journey
after
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
but
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
its
roaring
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
when
we
thought
that
soon
we
would
see
trees
fields
fresh
people
animals
a
world
and
that
world
america
then
above
everything
was
the
meeting
with
friends
we
had
not
seen
for
years
for
almost
everybody
had
some
friends
awaiting
them
morning
found
all
the
passengers
up
and
expectant
someone
questioned
the
captain
and
he
said
we
would
land
there
was
another
long
day
and
another
sleepless
night
but
when
these
ended
at
last
how
busy
we
were
first
we
packed
up
all
the
things
we
did
not
need
then
put
on
fresh
clothing
and
then
went
on
deck
to
watch
for
land
it
was
almost
three
the
hour
the
captain
hoped
to
reach
boston
but
there
was
nothing
new
to
be
seen
the
weather
was
fair
so
we
would
have
seen
anything
within
a
number
of
miles
anxiously
we
watched
and
as
we
talked
of
the
strange
delay
our
courage
began
to
give
out
with
our
hope
when
it
could
be
borne
no
longer
a
gentleman
went
to
speak
to
the
captain
he
was
on
the
upper
deck
examining
the
horizon
he
put
off
the
arrival
for
the
next
day
you
can
imagine
our
feelings
at
this
when
it
was
worse
the
captain
came
down
and
talked
so
assuringly
that
in
spite
of
all
the
disappointments
we
had
had
we
believed
that
this
was
the
last
and
were
quite
cheerful
when
we
went
to
bed
the
morning
was
glorious
it
was
the
eighth
of
may
the
seventeenth
day
after
we
left
hamburg
the
sky
was
clear
and
blue
the
sun
shone
brightly
as
if
to
congratulate
us
that
we
had
safely
crossed
the
stormy
sea
and
to
apologize
for
having
kept
away
from
us
so
long
the
sea
had
lost
its
fury
it
was
almost
as
quiet
as
it
had
been
at
hamburg
before
we
started
and
its
color
was
a
beautiful
greenish
blue
birds
were
all
the
time
in
the
air
and
it
was
worth
while
to
live
merely
to
hear
their
songs
and
soon
oh
joyful
sight
we
saw
the
tops
of
two
trees
what
a
shout
there
rose
everyone
pointed
out
the
welcome
sight
to
everybody
else
as
if
they
did
not
see
it
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
it
as
if
they
saw
a
miracle
and
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
joys
of
the
day
what
confusion
there
was
some
were
flying
up
the
stairs
to
the
upper
deck
some
were
tearing
down
to
the
lower
one
others
were
running
in
and
out
of
the
cabins
some
were
in
all
parts
of
the
ship
in
one
minute
and
all
were
talking
and
laughing
and
getting
in
somebody
way
such
excitement
such
joy
we
had
seen
two
trees
then
steamers
and
boats
of
all
kinds
passed
by
in
all
directions
we
shouted
and
the
men
stood
up
in
the
boats
and
returned
the
greeting
waving
their
hats
we
were
as
glad
to
see
them
as
if
they
were
old
friends
of
ours
oh
what
a
beautiful
scene
no
corner
of
the
earth
is
half
so
fair
as
the
lovely
picture
before
us
it
came
to
view
suddenly
a
green
field
a
real
field
with
grass
on
it
and
large
houses
and
the
dearest
hens
and
little
chickens
in
all
the
world
and
trees
and
birds
and
people
at
work
the
young
green
things
put
new
life
into
us
and
are
so
dear
to
our
eyes
that
we
dare
not
speak
a
word
now
lest
the
magic
should
vanish
away
and
we
should
be
left
to
the
stormy
scenes
we
know
but
nothing
disturbed
the
fairy
sight
instead
new
scenes
appeared
beautiful
as
the
first
the
sky
becomes
bluer
all
the
time
the
sun
warmer
the
sea
is
too
quiet
for
its
name
and
the
most
beautiful
blue
imaginable
what
are
the
feelings
these
sights
awaken
they
can
not
be
described
to
know
how
great
was
our
happiness
how
complete
how
free
from
even
the
shadow
of
a
sadness
you
must
make
a
journey
of
sixteen
days
on
a
stormy
ocean
is
it
possible
that
we
will
ever
again
be
so
happy
it
was
about
three
hours
since
we
saw
the
first
landmarks
when
a
number
of
men
came
on
board
from
a
little
steamer
and
examined
the
passengers
to
see
if
they
were
properly
vaccinated
we
had
been
vaccinated
on
the
polynesia
and
pronounced
everyone
all
right
then
they
went
away
except
one
man
who
remained
an
hour
later
we
saw
the
wharves
before
the
ship
had
fully
stopped
the
climax
of
our
joy
was
reached
one
of
us
espied
the
figure
and
face
we
had
longed
to
see
for
three
long
years
in
a
moment
five
passengers
on
the
polynesia
were
crying
papa
and
gesticulating
and
laughing
and
hugging
one
another
and
going
wild
altogether
all
the
rest
were
roused
by
our
excitement
and
came
to
see
our
father
he
recognized
us
as
soon
as
we
him
and
stood
apart
on
the
wharf
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
thought
what
followed
was
slow
torture
like
mad
things
we
ran
about
where
there
was
room
unable
to
stand
still
as
long
as
we
were
on
the
ship
and
he
on
shore
to
have
crossed
the
ocean
only
to
come
within
a
few
yards
of
him
unable
to
get
nearer
till
all
the
fuss
was
over
was
dreadful
enough
but
to
hear
other
passengers
called
who
had
no
reason
for
hurry
while
we
were
left
among
the
last
was
unendurable
oh
dear
why
ca
we
get
off
the
hateful
ship
why
ca
papa
come
to
us
why
so
many
ceremonies
at
the
landing
we
said
to
our
friends
as
their
turn
came
wishing
we
were
in
their
luck
to
give
us
something
else
to
think
of
papa
succeeded
in
passing
us
some
fruit
and
we
wondered
to
find
it
anything
but
a
great
wonder
for
we
expected
to
find
everything
marvellous
in
the
strange
country
still
the
ceremonies
went
on
each
person
was
asked
a
hundred
or
so
stupid
questions
and
all
their
answers
were
written
down
by
a
very
slow
man
the
baggage
had
to
be
examined
the
tickets
and
a
hundred
other
things
done
before
anyone
was
allowed
to
step
ashore
all
to
keep
us
back
as
long
as
possible
now
imagine
yourself
parting
with
all
you
love
believing
it
to
be
a
parting
for
life
breaking
up
your
home
selling
the
things
that
years
have
made
dear
to
you
starting
on
a
journey
without
the
least
experience
in
travelling
in
the
face
of
many
inconveniences
on
account
of
the
want
of
sufficient
money
being
met
with
disappointment
where
it
was
not
to
be
expected
with
rough
treatment
everywhere
till
you
are
forced
to
go
and
make
friends
for
yourself
among
strangers
being
obliged
to
sell
some
of
your
most
necessary
things
to
pay
bills
you
did
not
willingly
incur
being
mistrusted
and
searched
then
half
starved
and
lodged
in
common
with
a
multitude
of
strangers
suffering
the
miseries
of
seasickness
the
disturbances
and
alarms
of
a
stormy
sea
for
sixteen
days
and
then
stand
within
a
few
yards
of
him
for
whom
you
did
all
this
unable
to
even
speak
to
him
easily
how
do
you
feel
oh
it
our
turn
at
last
we
are
questioned
examined
and
dismissed
a
rush
over
the
planks
on
one
side
over
the
ground
on
the
other
six
wild
beings
cling
to
each
other
bound
by
a
common
bond
of
tender
joy
and
the
long
parting
is
at
an
end
