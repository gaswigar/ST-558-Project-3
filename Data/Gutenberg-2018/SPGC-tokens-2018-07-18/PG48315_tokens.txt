there
was
a
new
in
course
of
construction
for
the
first
form
at
helmsworth
preparatory
school
and
the
ten
senior
boys
whose
united
ages
amounted
to
some
hundred
and
thirty
years
were
taken
for
the
time
being
in
the
school
museum
this
was
a
big
boarded
room
covered
with
corrugated
iron
and
built
out
somewhat
separate
from
the
other
class
rooms
at
the
corner
of
the
the
arrangement
had
many
advantages
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
boys
for
the
room
was
full
of
agreeably
distracting
and
interesting
objects
and
cicero
almost
ceased
to
be
tedious
even
when
he
wrote
about
friendship
if
when
you
were
construing
you
could
meditate
on
the
skeleton
of
a
kangaroo
which
stood
immediately
in
front
of
you
and
refresh
yourself
with
the
sight
of
the
stuffed
seal
on
whose
nose
the
ferrers
major
had
balanced
his
spectacles
before
dutton
came
in
or
again
it
was
agreeable
to
speculate
on
the
number
of
buns
a
mammoth
might
be
able
to
put
simultaneously
into
his
mouth
seeing
that
a
huge
yellowish
object
that
stood
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
cases
was
just
one
of
his
teeth
of
course
it
depended
on
how
many
teeth
a
mammoth
had
but
the
number
of
a
boy
s
teeth
might
be
some
guide
and
david
in
the
throes
of
grinding
out
the
weekly
letter
to
his
father
passed
his
tongue
round
his
own
teeth
trying
to
count
them
by
the
sensory
quality
of
it
but
losing
count
he
put
an
inky
forefinger
into
his
mouth
instead
there
seemed
to
be
fourteen
in
his
lower
jaw
and
thirteen
and
a
half
in
the
upper
for
half
of
a
front
tooth
had
been
missing
ever
since
a
few
weeks
ago
he
had
fallen
out
of
a
tree
on
to
his
face
and
the
most
industrious
scrutiny
of
that
fatal
spot
had
never
resulted
in
his
finding
it
in
any
case
then
he
had
and
a
half
teeth
and
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
mammoth
therefore
unless
he
had
fallen
out
of
a
tree
if
there
were
such
in
the
glacial
age
had
at
least
that
huge
yellow
lump
of
a
thing
then
as
big
as
david
s
whole
head
was
only
one
of
his
chewing
apparatus
why
an
entire
bun
could
stick
to
it
and
be
unobserved
a
mammoth
could
have
buns
in
his
mouth
and
really
remain
unaware
of
the
fact
fancy
having
a
bun
on
every
tooth
and
not
knowing
how
much
ought
a
mammoth
s
to
be
if
you
had
to
provide
on
this
scale
and
when
would
its
mouth
be
really
full
and
how
david
was
growing
a
little
sleepy
blaize
said
dutton
s
voice
david
sucked
his
finger
yes
sir
he
said
have
you
finished
your
letter
home
no
sir
said
david
with
engaging
candour
then
i
would
suggest
that
you
ceased
trying
to
clean
your
finger
and
get
on
with
rather
sir
said
david
the
boys
desks
transferred
from
their
old
stood
in
a
square
in
the
centre
of
the
museum
while
dutton
s
table
with
his
desk
on
it
was
in
the
window
the
door
of
the
museum
was
open
so
too
was
the
window
by
the
master
s
seat
for
the
hour
was
between
four
and
five
of
the
afternoon
and
the
afternoon
that
of
a
sweltering
july
sunday
dutton
himself
was
a
tall
and
ineffective
young
man
entirely
undistinguished
for
either
physical
or
mental
powers
who
had
taken
a
somewhat
moderate
degree
at
cambridge
and
had
played
lacrosse
by
virtue
of
the
mediocrity
of
his
attainments
his
scholastic
career
had
not
risen
to
the
heights
of
a
public
school
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
be
content
with
a
mastership
at
this
preparatory
establishment
he
bullied
in
a
rather
feeble
manner
the
boys
under
his
charge
and
drew
in
his
horns
if
they
showed
signs
of
not
being
afraid
of
him
but
in
these
cases
he
took
it
out
of
them
by
sending
in
the
gloomiest
reports
of
their
conduct
and
progress
at
the
end
of
term
to
the
fierce
and
tremendous
clergyman
who
was
the
head
of
the
place
the
head
inspired
universal
terror
both
among
his
assistant
masters
and
his
pupils
but
he
inspired
also
a
admiration
he
did
not
take
more
than
half
a
dozen
classes
during
the
week
but
he
was
liable
to
descend
on
any
form
without
a
moment
s
notice
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
he
used
the
cane
with
remarkable
energy
and
preached
sermons
in
the
school
chapel
on
sunday
the
boys
who
were
experienced
augurs
on
such
subjects
knew
all
about
this
and
dreaded
a
notably
sermon
as
presaging
trouble
on
monday
in
fact
acland
had
his
notions
about
discipline
and
completely
lived
up
to
them
in
his
conduct
having
told
blaize
to
get
on
with
his
dutton
resumed
his
employment
which
was
not
what
it
seemed
on
his
desk
it
is
true
was
a
large
for
he
had
been
hearing
the
boys
their
catechism
in
the
matter
of
which
blaize
had
proved
himself
wonderfully
ignorant
and
had
been
condemned
to
write
out
his
duty
towards
his
neighbour
who
had
very
agreeably
attempted
to
prompt
him
three
times
and
show
it
up
before
morning
school
on
monday
there
was
a
bible
there
also
out
of
which
when
the
sunday
letters
home
were
finished
dutton
would
read
a
chapter
about
the
second
missionary
journey
of
paul
and
then
ask
questions
but
while
these
letters
were
being
written
dutton
was
not
sabbatically
employed
for
nestling
between
his
books
was
a
volume
of
stories
by
guy
de
maupassant
dutton
found
him
most
entertaining
he
skated
on
such
very
thin
ice
and
never
quite
went
through
dutton
turned
the
page
yes
how
clever
not
to
go
through
for
there
was
certainly
mud
underneath
he
gave
a
faint
chuckle
of
interest
and
dexterously
turned
the
chuckle
into
a
cough
at
that
sound
a
small
sigh
of
relief
a
sense
of
relaxation
went
round
the
class
for
it
was
clear
that
old
dutton
dubs
was
his
more
general
nomenclature
was
deep
in
his
yellow
book
when
that
consummation
so
devoutly
wished
was
arrived
at
any
diversion
of
a
moderately
quiet
nature
might
be
indulged
in
crabtree
began
he
was
a
boy
of
face
and
had
been
known
as
nanny
till
the
somewhat
voluminous
appearance
of
his
new
pair
of
trousers
had
caused
him
to
be
rechristened
bags
he
had
finished
his
letter
to
his
mother
with
remarkable
speed
and
had
by
writing
small
conveyed
quite
sufficient
information
to
her
on
a
there
was
thus
the
other
noiselessly
torn
off
to
be
framed
into
munitions
of
aerial
warfare
he
folded
it
neatly
into
the
form
of
a
dart
he
inked
the
point
of
it
by
dipping
it
into
the
china
receptacle
at
the
top
of
his
desk
and
launched
it
with
unerring
aim
enfilading
the
where
david
sat
it
hit
him
just
exactly
where
the
other
half
of
his
missing
tooth
should
have
been
for
his
lip
was
drawn
back
and
his
tongue
slightly
protruded
in
the
agonies
of
composing
a
suitable
letter
to
his
father
the
soft
wet
point
struck
it
full
and
spattered
ink
over
his
lip
oh
damn
said
david
very
softly
then
he
paused
stricken
to
stone
and
quite
ready
to
deny
that
he
had
spoken
at
all
his
eyes
apprehensively
sought
dutton
and
he
saw
that
he
had
not
heard
being
deep
in
the
misfortunes
that
happened
to
mademoiselle
fifi
i
ll
lick
you
afterwards
bags
he
said
gently
better
lick
yourself
now
whispered
bags
a
faint
giggle
at
bags
s
repartee
went
round
the
class
like
the
sound
of
a
breaking
ripple
this
penetrated
into
dutton
s
consciousness
and
shifting
his
attitude
a
little
without
looking
up
he
leaned
his
forehead
on
his
open
hand
so
that
he
could
observe
the
boys
through
the
chinks
of
his
fingers
david
of
course
was
far
too
old
a
hand
to
be
caught
by
this
paltry
subterfuge
for
playing
chinks
was
a
man≈ìuvre
of
the
enemy
which
had
got
quite
stale
through
repetition
and
he
therefore
gently
laid
down
on
the
sloping
top
of
his
locker
the
dart
which
he
had
just
dipped
again
in
his
inkpot
to
throw
back
at
bags
and
with
an
industrious
air
turned
to
his
letter
again
the
twenty
minutes
allotted
on
sunday
afternoon
school
for
writing
home
to
parents
was
already
more
than
half
spent
but
the
date
which
he
had
copied
off
his
neighbour
and
my
dear
papa
was
as
far
as
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
of
composition
had
carried
him
it
was
really
difficult
to
know
what
to
say
to
his
dear
papa
for
all
the
events
of
the
past
week
were
completely
thrown
into
shadow
by
the
one
sunlit
fact
that
he
had
got
his
for
cricket
and
had
made
runs
in
the
last
match
but
as
he
knew
perfectly
well
his
father
cared
as
little
for
cricket
as
he
did
for
football
indeed
david
ironically
doubted
if
he
knew
the
difference
between
them
and
that
deplorable
fact
restricted
the
zone
of
interests
common
to
them
and
really
the
only
other
event
of
true
importance
was
that
his
aunt
had
sent
him
a
postal
order
for
five
shillings
it
would
not
be
politic
to
tell
his
father
about
that
in
case
of
inquiries
being
made
as
to
what
he
had
done
with
it
when
he
got
home
in
a
fortnight
s
time
for
the
summer
holidays
he
would
have
eaten
it
all
long
before
then
for
it
was
david
bit
heavily
into
his
wooden
in
his
efforts
to
think
of
something
innocuous
to
say
and
found
his
mouth
full
of
fragments
of
chewed
wood
these
he
proceeded
to
masticate
rather
ostentatiously
while
he
still
sucked
his
inky
lip
the
joy
of
this
being
that
old
dubs
was
still
playing
chinks
and
would
certainly
as
a
surprise
ask
him
before
long
what
he
was
eating
this
was
stimulating
to
the
mind
and
he
plunged
into
his
letter
we
are
being
taken
in
the
museum
because
they
are
building
a
new
there
was
too
in
the
wainscotting
of
the
old
one
we
have
been
doing
cicero
this
week
as
well
as
virgil
and
xenophon
in
greek
and
medea
and
holland
in
geography
and
james
i
have
got
to
division
of
decimals
which
is
very
interesting
and
which
is
most
difficult
because
some
have
it
and
others
don
david
gave
one
fleeting
glance
at
dutton
and
saw
that
the
blessed
moment
was
approaching
the
chink
had
widened
and
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
was
he
who
was
being
observed
then
he
bent
his
yellow
head
over
his
letter
again
and
chewed
the
fragments
of
with
renewed
vigour
it
was
very
hot
all
this
week
and
i
and
two
other
chaps
were
taken
to
bathe
at
the
richmond
day
before
yesterday
blaize
what
are
you
eating
said
dutton
suddenly
david
looked
up
in
bland
and
innocent
surprise
eating
sir
he
asked
my
a
slight
titter
went
round
the
class
for
david
had
the
enviable
reputation
of
drawing
his
pastors
and
masters
always
excepting
head
by
the
geniality
and
unexpectedness
of
his
replies
but
on
this
occasion
the
blandness
was
a
little
overdone
and
instead
of
taking
a
back
seat
dutton
put
down
his
yellow
novel
on
his
desk
back
upwards
and
came
across
the
room
to
where
david
was
sitting
the
dart
with
its
wet
inky
point
lay
there
and
it
was
too
late
to
draw
his
over
it
but
a
more
dramatic
than
the
mere
discovery
of
an
inky
dart
which
might
be
assessed
at
fifty
perhaps
a
hundred
since
it
was
in
the
air
open
your
mouth
said
dutton
not
yet
seeing
the
dart
david
had
a
good
large
useful
mouth
and
he
opened
it
very
suddenly
to
its
extremest
extent
putting
out
his
tongue
a
little
which
might
or
might
not
have
been
an
accident
that
unruly
member
was
undoubtedly
covered
with
splinters
of
common
and
nothing
else
at
all
said
david
all
in
one
breath
opening
it
the
moment
he
had
spoken
to
its
widest
dutton
s
eye
fell
on
the
inky
dart
what
is
that
he
said
david
gave
a
prodigious
gulp
and
swallowed
as
much
as
was
convenient
that
sir
he
said
politely
a
paper
dart
sir
did
you
make
it
asked
dubs
david
s
face
assumed
an
expression
of
horror
sir
no
sir
he
said
in
a
tone
of
wounded
and
innocent
indignation
suddenly
david
became
conscious
that
his
impeccable
scene
with
dutton
was
arousing
no
interest
or
amusement
among
the
audience
and
his
artistic
feelings
were
hurt
for
he
hated
playing
to
apathetic
benches
he
looked
earnestly
and
soulfully
at
dutton
but
missed
appreciative
giggles
nobody
appeared
to
be
taking
the
smallest
interest
in
the
dialogue
and
all
round
were
bent
heads
and
pens
industriously
scratching
then
he
saw
what
the
rest
of
the
class
had
already
seen
standing
just
outside
the
open
window
his
foot
noiseless
on
the
grass
was
the
head
austere
and
enormous
and
fierce
and
frowning
he
had
picked
up
from
dutton
s
desk
the
novel
that
lay
there
and
was
looking
at
it
with
a
portentous
face
then
who
made
it
say
if
did
not
said
dutton
still
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
his
superior
i
suppose
another
fellow
said
david
in
very
different
tones
from
those
in
which
his
moral
indignation
had
found
dramatic
utterance
dutton
took
up
the
dart
and
inked
his
but
david
did
not
smile
who
he
began
and
turned
and
saw
oh
jam
said
david
under
his
breath
the
head
left
the
window
with
the
yellow
book
in
his
hand
took
two
steps
to
the
door
and
entered
the
he
was
a
tall
man
lean
and
wiry
with
cold
grey
eyes
to
the
boys
he
appeared
of
gigantic
height
and
was
tragedy
and
fate
personified
terror
encompassed
him
he
scintillated
with
it
as
radium
scintillates
and
is
unconsumed
but
he
scintillated
also
with
splendour
he
was
probably
omniscient
and
of
his
omnipotence
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
he
had
rowed
for
oxford
against
cambridge
and
the
boys
wondered
that
cambridge
had
dared
to
put
a
boat
on
the
river
at
all
that
year
he
had
also
got
a
which
in
itself
was
less
impressive
and
he
was
believed
to
be
fabulously
wealthy
how
any
woman
had
ever
ventured
to
marry
him
no
one
knew
but
after
all
if
he
had
expressed
a
wish
that
way
it
was
equally
inconceivable
that
it
should
not
be
gratified
though
there
was
not
a
boy
in
the
school
who
did
not
dread
his
displeasure
above
everything
else
in
the
world
there
was
none
who
would
not
have
taken
an
infinity
of
trouble
to
be
sure
of
winning
his
approbation
one
of
his
legs
was
slightly
shorter
than
the
other
which
gave
him
a
swaying
or
rocking
motion
when
he
walked
which
david
could
imitate
admirably
but
he
would
nearly
have
died
of
astonishment
if
he
had
known
that
more
than
once
the
head
had
seen
him
do
it
and
had
laughed
in
his
beard
with
twinkling
eyes
there
was
no
twinkle
or
laughter
there
still
with
the
yellow
volume
in
his
hand
he
came
and
stood
before
the
skeleton
of
the
kangaroo
and
a
silence
fell
that
will
perhaps
be
equalled
for
breathlessness
on
the
day
that
the
judgment
books
are
opened
but
probably
not
before
then
he
spoke
silence
he
said
there
was
not
any
more
silence
possible
so
he
had
to
be
content
with
that
he
addressed
his
lieutenant
who
stood
abjectly
twirling
a
small
moustache
and
trying
to
look
tall
but
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
look
tall
beside
that
matterhorn
or
to
twirl
an
adolescent
moustache
when
the
head
s
hand
clawed
his
beard
it
was
simply
silly
mr
dutton
said
the
head
when
the
silence
had
begun
to
sing
in
the
ears
of
the
listeners
by
some
strange
repeat
by
some
strange
mischance
have
found
this
disgusting
and
licentious
book
on
your
desk
how
it
got
there
how
it
happened
to
be
opened
page
i
do
not
wish
to
inquire
it
is
more
than
enough
for
me
to
have
found
it
there
i
am
willing
to
believe
and
to
tell
you
so
publicly
dutton
before
the
boys
whom
you
are
superintending
on
this
sunday
afternoon
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
some
obscene
bird
passed
over
the
museum
and
dropped
from
its
claws
this
sir
dropped
it
sir
while
your
back
was
turned
on
the
very
table
where
i
see
the
book
of
books
and
also
the
book
of
common
prayer
with
your
leave
with
your
leave
dutton
i
will
do
thus
and
thus
to
this
unholy
then
ensued
a
slight
anticlimax
for
the
head
though
a
very
strong
man
in
hand
and
arm
found
it
impossible
to
do
as
he
had
designed
and
tear
three
hundred
pages
across
and
across
but
the
form
generally
and
dutton
in
particular
were
too
stiff
with
horror
to
notice
it
so
instead
the
head
tore
off
section
after
section
of
the
lightly
sewn
leaves
instead
of
tearing
the
pages
laid
the
dismembered
carrion
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
and
then
with
an
indescribable
ejaculation
of
disgust
threw
the
mutilated
remains
into
the
fireplace
you
are
excused
dutton
he
said
from
the
rest
of
this
lesson
which
i
will
take
myself
but
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
call
on
me
immediately
after
evensong
this
his
fierce
eye
wandered
from
dutton
s
stricken
face
to
david
s
desk
where
lay
the
inky
dart
you
are
engaged
now
i
see
in
some
inquiry
he
said
a
paper
dart
i
perceive
on
blaize
s
desk
i
will
conduct
the
inquiry
myself
and
wish
you
a
good
he
waited
in
tense
silence
till
dutton
had
taken
his
hat
and
left
the
room
then
he
turned
to
david
blaize
did
you
make
that
dart
or
did
you
throw
it
he
asked
an
expression
of
despairing
determination
had
come
into
david
s
face
he
was
conscious
also
of
a
large
on
his
lips
neither
sir
he
said
then
who
made
it
said
the
head
and
also
for
i
perceive
the
point
is
blunted
who
threw
it
dead
silence
on
david
s
part
do
you
know
asked
the
head
yes
sir
said
david
and
do
you
refuse
to
tell
me
i
am
not
here
to
be
bullied
i
may
remind
david
felt
slightly
sick
but
he
had
swallowed
a
good
deal
of
chewed
do
you
refuse
to
tell
me
repeated
the
head
yes
sir
said
david
then
came
one
of
those
strange
calms
in
the
middle
of
cyclones
which
sometimes
puzzled
the
boys
but
their
conjecture
a
perfectly
right
one
was
that
the
head
in
spite
of
questions
like
these
did
not
like
anyhow
for
a
moment
his
fierceness
faded
and
he
nodded
at
david
just
as
one
pal
might
nod
to
another
in
sympathetic
assent
quite
right
my
boy
he
said
then
he
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
class
holding
up
the
bedraggled
weapon
name
he
said
the
miserable
bags
stood
up
without
speech
oh
you
crabtree
said
the
awful
voice
and
so
master
crabtree
thinks
that
the
calm
and
quiet
of
sunday
afternoon
is
made
to
give
him
leisure
to
forge
these
filthy
weapons
that
the
paper
you
are
given
to
write
home
on
is
designed
to
be
desecrated
to
these
foul
usages
and
the
ink
to
supply
filth
to
them
you
will
write
out
with
the
ink
you
have
so
strangely
misused
two
hundred
lines
of
virgil
in
hand
and
eat
your
dinner
at
the
apart
from
your
companions
for
the
next
the
it
may
be
mentioned
was
a
separate
table
in
the
without
chairs
where
boys
detected
in
swinish
habits
had
to
take
their
meals
standing
for
the
period
of
their
sentence
but
poor
bags
s
cup
was
not
full
yet
for
the
head
s
eagle
eye
fell
on
david
s
inky
mouth
i
infer
that
the
ink
on
blaize
s
lips
was
made
by
this
weapon
he
said
that
is
so
then
you
will
now
beg
blaize
s
pardon
and
as
soon
as
the
catechism
and
is
over
you
will
fetch
a
basin
of
water
and
bathe
blaize
s
mouth
with
your
own
sponge
until
it
is
pronounced
clean
by
your
matron
the
hour
for
writing
home
is
up
sign
your
names
and
direct
your
envelopes
catechism
now
the
had
already
been
held
and
the
marks
for
it
had
been
put
down
in
the
book
which
lay
on
dutton
s
desk
but
to
suggest
or
hint
this
was
not
less
inconceivable
than
to
propose
playing
the
more
imaginative
saw
that
there
might
be
fresh
trouble
when
catechism
marks
were
put
down
and
it
was
found
that
dutton
had
already
entered
them
in
his
neat
small
handwriting
but
the
idea
of
venturing
to
correct
the
head
when
he
was
in
this
was
merely
unthinkable
david
indeed
the
boldest
of
them
all
and
at
the
moment
with
something
of
the
halo
of
martyrdom
about
him
wondered
what
would
happen
if
he
did
so
but
quailed
before
the
possible
result
so
catechism
began
again
and
for
a
little
all
went
smoothly
the
head
of
course
knew
that
among
small
boys
at
school
christian
names
are
held
to
be
effeminate
and
disgraceful
things
and
so
omitting
the
first
question
asked
stone
the
who
had
given
him
his
name
and
stone
knew
ferrers
also
knew
what
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
then
did
for
him
and
david
expressed
himself
accurately
as
bound
to
believe
and
to
do
what
they
had
promised
for
him
the
commandments
went
smoothly
but
trouble
began
when
the
boys
had
to
explain
what
they
chiefly
learned
from
those
commandments
any
meaning
that
they
might
have
possessed
any
effort
to
attach
rational
ideas
to
them
was
overshadowed
by
the
fact
that
primarily
this
was
a
lesson
that
should
have
been
acquired
by
heart
in
order
to
recite
it
faultlessly
to
that
presence
that
frowned
at
dutton
s
desk
his
duty
towards
his
neighbour
had
already
baffled
david
that
afternoon
but
for
the
moment
having
recited
the
eighth
commandment
his
turn
was
passed
and
troubles
never
coming
singly
bags
was
faced
with
this
abstruse
question
the
first
sentences
went
rightly
enough
but
then
he
began
to
falter
to
honour
and
obey
the
king
and
all
that
are
put
in
authority
under
her
asked
the
head
bags
s
a
comparatively
ancient
one
given
him
at
his
christening
by
a
godmother
was
a
queen
s
queen
and
all
that
are
put
in
authority
under
her
he
quavered
getting
confused
next
said
the
head
king
and
all
that
are
put
in
authority
under
him
said
sharpe
major
in
a
shrill
treble
to
submit
myself
to
all
my
governors
teachers
spiritual
pastors
and
masters
to
order
myself
lowly
and
reverently
to
all
my
betters
honour
and
obey
the
next
said
the
head
with
ominous
calm
the
dreary
tale
of
failure
went
on
with
that
portentous
figure
sitting
in
the
chair
of
the
innocuous
dutton
consecutive
thought
became
impossible
and
memory
took
wings
and
fled
boys
who
had
got
full
marks
earlier
in
the
afternoon
found
themselves
unable
when
facing
this
grim
mood
of
the
head
s
to
repeat
their
duty
towards
anything
the
ground
already
covered
was
taken
again
in
order
to
give
them
a
fresh
start
and
now
the
creed
itself
presented
pitfalls
and
already
the
normal
hour
for
the
class
had
been
exceeded
and
from
other
and
happier
the
boys
poured
out
into
the
field
in
front
of
the
windows
or
lay
on
rugs
under
the
shade
of
the
big
still
elms
and
with
linked
arms
and
treble
intercourse
wandered
across
the
sunny
grass
and
even
when
the
catechism
was
done
there
was
the
to
follow
and
before
the
there
was
certain
to
be
the
discovery
that
the
catechism
had
already
been
put
down
all
this
was
that
ass
dubs
s
fault
for
leaving
his
rotten
french
novel
on
his
desk
worse
than
anything
the
when
it
came
was
that
most
inexplicable
second
voyage
of
paul
thyatira
or
was
it
laodicea
or
were
they
the
seven
churches
of
asia
and
what
exactly
did
underpinning
the
ship
mean
or
was
that
man≈ìuvre
executed
on
the
other
voyage
dutton
always
consulted
the
new
testament
maclear
over
this
elusive
cruise
whereas
the
boys
had
to
shut
up
that
useful
volume
when
they
were
questioned
it
seemed
scarcely
fair
and
even
the
had
not
been
arrived
at
yet
they
were
still
sticking
and
bogged
in
the
quagmires
of
the
catechism
at
last
they
stuck
altogether
there
was
no
more
progression
possible
it
only
remained
to
hear
the
sentence
on
their
condemned
heads
everybody
without
exception
was
condemned
one
had
to
write
out
the
creed
another
the
commandments
and
all
their
duty
towards
their
neighbours
and
i
shall
myself
take
the
same
lesson
week
said
the
head
and
if
the
form
generally
does
not
show
a
far
better
knowledge
of
the
catechism
i
shall
be
unable
to
adopt
the
leniency
with
which
i
have
treated
their
shortcomings
next
sunday
then
i
shall
hold
the
class
in
my
the
significance
of
this
was
not
lost
upon
anybody
the
study
was
a
room
of
awful
import
and
the
comfort
of
the
low
red
morocco
settee
the
interest
of
the
photographs
of
oxford
crews
on
the
wall
in
which
the
head
appeared
with
and
no
beard
could
not
compensate
for
the
uneasy
knowledge
that
in
the
middle
drawer
of
the
table
at
which
he
sat
were
a
couple
of
canes
it
was
no
rare
thing
for
the
head
to
take
a
bunch
of
rattling
keys
from
his
pocket
which
was
the
first
step
and
to
fit
one
of
them
into
the
centre
drawer
sometimes
with
rising
voice
he
turned
it
and
opened
the
drawer
and
if
things
still
went
badly
the
trembling
victim
was
put
through
the
farce
of
choosing
which
cane
he
preferred
and
then
advancing
the
palms
of
his
hands
the
head
paused
after
this
prodigious
announcement
about
the
venue
for
the
next
sunday
and
opened
the
dutton
was
scrupulously
neat
in
his
methods
and
there
in
the
first
column
of
the
marks
for
the
new
week
was
his
list
headed
the
head
scrutinised
these
in
silence
the
marks
for
s
catechism
are
already
entered
he
said
stone
you
are
the
of
the
class
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
dutton
had
already
heard
you
your
catechism
i
will
tell
you
why
you
wanted
me
to
waste
my
time
and
yours
so
that
we
should
not
have
so
long
for
the
was
that
it
sir
said
stone
what
was
your
reason
then
for
not
telling
me
stone
looked
at
him
in
a
sort
of
stunned
despair
i
don
t
know
sir
he
said
it
was
indeed
a
black
afternoon
the
head
probably
owing
to
his
discovery
on
dutton
s
desk
was
in
his
sternest
and
most
awful
mood
already
five
o
clock
had
struck
whereas
the
lesson
should
have
been
over
by
four
and
outside
the
boys
were
beginning
to
gather
up
their
rugs
and
books
and
were
strolling
over
the
grass
of
the
to
the
from
which
the
warning
bell
for
tea
was
invitingly
clanging
it
was
maddening
to
think
that
all
this
time
might
have
been
saved
and
all
the
impositions
and
the
hour
next
sunday
in
the
dreaded
study
avoided
if
only
as
it
now
turned
out
stone
had
had
the
courage
to
say
that
dutton
had
already
heard
them
their
catechism
but
courage
was
not
a
quality
that
blossomed
when
the
head
was
in
a
poor
temper
and
every
boy
in
the
class
knew
that
if
he
had
been
in
stone
s
place
he
would
have
held
his
tongue
he
might
easily
have
been
told
not
to
bully
the
head
a
somewhat
favourite
expression
or
have
been
witheringly
requested
to
give
him
permission
to
conduct
the
class
in
the
manner
he
preferred
chapel
was
held
at
six
and
when
tea
was
to
come
in
was
difficult
of
conjecture
yet
even
a
chapel
would
be
something
of
a
relief
if
only
the
of
an
hour
that
intervened
could
be
got
through
without
storms
but
before
then
they
would
have
to
embark
on
this
missionary
enterprise
which
if
it
was
as
dangerous
for
paul
as
it
was
likely
to
prove
for
the
students
of
it
must
have
required
a
bold
heart
and
what
added
sting
to
it
was
that
stone
had
received
a
hamper
from
home
only
the
day
before
on
which
his
friends
would
have
gorged
sumptuously
the
minutes
went
by
with
paralysed
slowness
for
if
the
catechism
had
been
trying
this
was
infinitely
worse
the
head
who
very
likely
wanted
his
tea
too
but
for
the
sake
of
discipline
and
education
mortified
his
appetite
as
well
as
those
of
the
boys
took
a
gloomier
and
gloomier
view
of
them
and
their
attainments
collateral
ignorance
of
the
position
of
iconium
was
seen
to
be
a
moral
crime
of
the
deepest
dye
and
the
dictionary
was
beggared
of
wounding
epithets
in
order
adequately
to
convey
the
enormity
of
not
knowing
its
position
as
regards
lystra
if
ferrers
major
had
committed
parricide
under
circumstances
of
unique
horror
he
could
not
have
been
held
up
to
blacker
obloquy
than
was
volleyed
on
him
for
his
remarks
about
thessalonica
none
escaped
the
task
of
making
a
map
with
the
names
of
the
principal
towns
and
the
track
of
the
journey
itself
in
red
ink
the
less
fortunate
had
to
produce
two
maps
by
this
time
next
week
and
the
only
thing
it
was
possible
to
be
thankful
for
was
that
this
nightmare
of
an
hour
had
not
been
taken
in
the
study
else
it
was
felt
the
function
of
the
keys
would
not
have
been
limited
to
mere
rattling
already
the
field
was
beginning
to
be
dotted
over
again
with
groups
of
boys
who
had
come
out
of
tea
and
were
waiting
for
to
ring
how
earnestly
it
was
possible
to
desire
to
come
david
had
never
known
before
but
anything
even
the
litany
or
as
would
happen
the
psalm
for
the
fifteenth
evening
of
the
month
which
had
verses
was
better
than
this
sulphurous
the
whole
class
was
limp
with
heat
and
hunger
and
terror
then
the
merciful
relief
of
the
querulous
bell
came
and
the
head
closed
his
bible
the
lesson
has
been
disgraceful
he
said
i
hope
for
all
your
say
i
next
sunday
will
not
be
a
repetition
of
i
am
more
particularly
distressed
when
i
think
that
some
of
you
like
blaize
are
the
sons
of
clergymen
and
have
therefore
greater
opportunities
of
studying
sacred
he
got
up
huge
and
towering
in
his
rustling
silk
gown
and
immediately
as
was
the
amazing
manner
of
him
who
never
nagged
however
severe
he
might
be
his
mood
completely
changed
and
his
eyes
twinkled
as
he
observed
the
depressed
class
there
my
boys
that
s
over
he
said
and
like
good
fellows
try
not
to
make
me
angry
with
you
again
i
hate
finding
fault
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
do
and
neither
you
nor
i
have
had
any
tea
so
when
chapel
is
over
you
will
all
go
to
the
housekeeper
s
room
and
ask
her
with
my
compliments
to
give
you
a
real
good
he
stalked
out
rocking
slightly
as
he
went
and
instantly
the
oppression
of
his
anger
being
gone
the
spirits
of
the
class
rose
jolly
decent
of
him
said

loathsome

on

spur
of
the
moment

squeaked
sharpe
major
david
by
a
dexterous
movement
got
sharpe
s
head
in
chancery
rubbed
his
nose
on
his
desk
pulled
his
hair
and
hit
him
over
the
biceps
any
more
remarks
about
papa
he
asked
cheerfully
come
on
out
with
chapter
ii
the
others
poured
out
into
the
sunshine
but
david
lingered
behind
with
bags
and
ferrers
major
and
began
burrowing
in
his
locker
to
find
the
box
belonging
to
his
two
they
were
male
and
female
as
the
lady
s
absence
of
long
horns
testified
and
it
was
hoped
that
even
in
confinement
she
might
some
day
be
confined
indeed
there
were
several
bets
on
as
to
which
form
the
babies
would
they
would
be
eggs
or
some
sort
of
caterpillar
or
minute
but
fully
developed
the
box
in
question
was
a
small
cardboard
oblong
of
cramped
dimensions
but
really
it
was
no
more
than
their
saloon
for
they
lived
in
david
s
at
night
since
it
had
been
ascertained
that
the
sides
of
it
were
too
steep
and
slippery
to
allow
their
escape
and
at
other
times
had
the
run
of
his
desk
in
and
were
allowed
quantities
of
healthy
exercise
when
their
owner
was
unoccupied
and
could
look
after
their
wayward
steps
but
now
since
after
chapel
david
would
not
come
back
to
the
it
was
necessary
to
put
them
in
their
which
was
pierced
with
holes
so
that
such
air
as
there
might
happen
to
be
in
david
s
pocket
should
penetrate
to
them
a
few
slips
of
grass
and
leaves
would
be
sufficient
to
sustain
them
until
they
were
regaled
with
bits
of
cake
and
a
strawberry
or
two
from
the
tea
which
was
to
be
provided
for
the
first
form
after
chapel
the
lady
was
lying
on
her
back
as
good
as
gold
waving
her
legs
slowly
in
the
air
having
probably
fallen
down
on
some
climbing
expedition
about
the
roof
of
the
locker
but
the
stag
himself
called
the
monarch
of
the
glen
could
not
at
once
be
found
but
a
little
careful
rummaging
disclosed
him
sitting
morosely
in
a
crevice
between
a
grammar
and
a
geography
book
i
say
i
don
t
believe
the
monarch
s
well
said
david
shouldn
t
think
so
living
in
your
fuggy
desk
said
bags
strolling
out
of
the
room
suddenly
david
perceived
as
by
a
special
revelation
that
he
must
kick
bags
bags
had
thrown
an
inky
dart
at
him
and
though
in
the
depression
of
the
that
had
been
forgotten
it
started
into
prominence
again
in
his
mind
further
bags
had
added
insult
to
injury
by
saying
that
his
desk
was
fuggy
certainly
he
must
kick
bags
just
once
juicily
and
call
it
all
square
david
gingerly
took
the
monarch
by
the
waist
so
that
his
pincers
nipped
the
empty
air
and
put
him
and
his
spouse
into
their
travelling
carriage
come
on
ferrers
he
said
on
their
way
across
to
chapel
he
paused
a
moment
to
pick
a
few
leaves
from
the
bright
squibs
of
on
the
elm
just
outside
the
and
took
ferrer
s
arm
don
t
let
s
go
too
quick
he
said
i
want
to
catch
bags
up
just
as
we
get
to
and
if
i
was
alone
he
might
suspect
then
you
ll
see
i
ll
give
him
one
kick
just
one
but
a
beauty
let
s
seem
to
be
diabolically
diplomatic
david
managed
his
man≈ìuvre
well
gradually
gaining
on
his
unsuspecting
victim
and
stalking
him
with
infinite
stealth
and
relish
there
was
no
question
of
honour
in
coming
behind
him
thus
unaware
for
bags
had
launched
a
dart
at
him
without
provocation
and
had
also
gone
jauntily
across
to
chapel
after
making
that
remark
about
david
s
fuggy
desk
should
bags
resent
a
good
sound
kick
which
was
a
pretty
just
payment
of
the
score
david
would
be
perfectly
happy
to
fight
him
afterwards
if
he
desired
it
it
was
quite
all
right
david
sometimes
lounging
sometimes
hurrying
and
all
the
time
talking
in
a
foolish
interested
manner
to
ferrers
came
up
close
to
the
rear
of
the
enemy
just
two
steps
outside
they
were
the
last
of
the
boys
to
go
in
and
david
had
space
to
swing
his
leg
for
the
moment
bags
was
too
much
astonished
to
be
hurt
and
david
passed
him
with
a
slight
smile
on
his
hopelessly
seraphic
face
went
up
the
gangway
to
his
seat
in
the
choir
just
opposite
the
organ
knelt
down
and
covered
a
gratified
face
with
his
hands
he
loved
doing
things
neatly
and
to
kick
bags
just
once
quite
correctly
like
that
was
as
good
as
cutting
a
ball
just
out
of
reach
of
point
the
evening
service
began
psalms
and
canticles
and
hymns
all
to
be
sung
it
was
that
terrible
fifteenth
evening
of
the
month
and
page
after
page
of
psalm
must
be
gone
through
only
that
morning
david
and
ferrers
had
had
an
impassioned
argument
as
to
whether
the
old
or
the
new
testament
was
the
beastliest
ferrers
maintaining
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
new
testament
that
could
compare
with
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
while
david
and
his
argument
was
strengthened
after
the
last
hour
affirmed
that
nothing
could
beat
the
missionary
journeys
not
if
it
tried
with
both
hands
but
as
the
psalm
for
the
fifteenth
evening
to
a
single
chant
too
went
on
he
felt
that
it
was
difficult
to
feel
honestly
that
there
could
be
anything
beastlier
especially
if
you
had
not
had
tea
he
hoped
ferrers
would
not
adduce
that
as
a
crushing
argument
for
the
supremacy
of
the
old
testament
on
it
went
and
as
an
antidote
to
its
interminableness
david
began
to
think
of
other
and
more
pleasant
things
there
was
his
and
his
runs
in
the
last
match
to
muse
upon
as
a
resisting
topic
to
the
tedium
of
the
children
of
israel
and
in
especial
one
gorgeous
pull
for
four
he
had
made
also
he
could
feel
on
the
side
of
his
leg
the
slight
vibration
from
the
of
the
monarch
and
his
wife
which
showed
they
were
moving
about
enjoying
it
was
to
be
hoped
the
fresh
he
had
nipped
off
for
them
it
was
in
his
trousers
pocket
that
these
were
confined
a
place
to
be
felt
stealthily
and
exteriorly
since
was
a
forbidden
attitude
in
chapel
just
below
the
box
were
the
two
the
yet
unchanged
splendour
of
aunt
eleanor
s
gift
also
in
anticipation
was
the
thought
of
the
tea
that
should
succeed
chapel
and
in
retrospect
the
remembrance
of
the
beautiful
kick
he
had
given
bags
but
the
psalm
was
a
corker
for
all
that
and
if
ferrers
major
brought
it
up
he
would
have
to
admit
it
the
psalm
began
to
show
promise
of
ending
and
it
was
already
possible
to
count
the
remaining
verses
then
suddenly
there
was
something
so
delightful
in
it
as
a
topical
allusion
that
ferrers
could
no
longer
advance
it
as
being
beastlier
than
anything
in
the
new
testament
and
david
s
contribution
to
the
music
swelled
out
at
once
more
lustily
and
he
looked
and
beamed
towards
bags
as
he
sang
he
smote
his
enemies
in
the
hinder
part
and
put
them
to
a
perpetual
ferrers
caught
his
eye
and
understood
but
bags
did
not
which
was
a
pity
david
felt
he
must
have
seen
the
appositeness
of
that
verse
but
he
did
not
look
up
poor
old
bags
perhaps
he
was
much
hurt
david
had
not
meant
to
hurt
him
much
he
had
only
wanted
to
kick
him
neatly
and
squarely
and
peacefully
ready
to
fight
afterwards
if
desired
the
senior
boys
of
the
first
form
read
the
lessons
at
these
services
and
it
was
the
turn
of
stone
and
ferrers
to
make
asses
of
themselves
in
the
school
phrase
the
rest
of
the
congregation
masters
and
boys
followed
the
reading
in
their
bibles
or
at
any
rate
found
the
place
and
meditated
among
the
masters
there
was
dutton
looking
peculiarly
depressed
with
whom
in
spite
of
his
general
beastliness
david
felt
a
certain
sympathy
as
he
was
commanded
to
honour
the
head
immediately
afterwards
on
the
subject
of
the
novel
at
the
organ
were
seated
the
two
misses
acland
daughters
of
the
head
one
to
play
the
other
to
turn
over
leaves
for
her
sister
and
to
pull
out
stops
or
put
them
in
she
also
poked
away
at
the
pedals
and
occasionally
dropped
books
on
the
keys
producing
the
most
wagnerian
effects
these
two
female
figures
with
plump
backs
turned
to
him
afforded
david
plenty
of
rather
acid
reflection
goggles
so
called
for
obvious
reasons
but
addressed
as
miss
mabel
was
the
elder
and
wasn
t
so
bad
though
she
had
a
woeful
tendency
to
improve
and
console
the
occasion
when
any
of
the
boys
got
into
trouble
and
was
a
kind
of
official
dove
with
an
after
the
deluge
but
carrots
this
concerning
her
hair
which
otherwise
belonged
to
miss
edith
had
lately
shown
herself
altogether
too
beastly
it
was
a
moral
certainty
that
it
was
she
who
had
sneaked
to
her
father
when
last
week
ferrers
had
gone
out
of
bounds
because
he
had
seen
her
in
richmond
and
so
of
course
she
had
seen
him
and
told
the
head
it
had
been
a
day
and
all
the
other
masters
had
been
in
their
and
it
have
been
carrots
ferrers
had
had
the
toothache
and
was
excused
afternoon
school
and
feeling
better
had
gone
to
richmond
it
wasn
t
fair
of
the
family
to
spy
for
the
head
he
of
course
and
the
rest
of
the
masters
were
your
natural
enemies
and
if
you
were
caught
by
them
that
was
the
fortune
of
war
but
if
carrots
or
goggles
and
all
the
crew
were
enemies
also
they
ought
to
be
declared
enemies
instead
they
pretended
to
be
friends
with
their
sisterly
advice
and
their
and
their
treacherous
smiles
oh
the
magnificat
that
was
soon
over
and
again
david
s
disapproving
eye
glanced
up
at
goggles
and
carrots
during
the
second
lesson
this
time
they
had
turned
round
on
their
and
spread
their
bibles
on
their
knees
ostentatiously
following
the
lesson
as
an
example
to
the
school
david
was
afraid
they
were
hypocrites
and
having
found
his
place
continued
to
meditate
on
them
yes
there
had
been
a
conference
on
the
subject
of
goggles
and
carrots
when
ferrers
returned
that
afternoon
from
a
short
and
extremely
painful
interview
with
the
head
and
it
had
been
settled
that
goggles
and
carrots
must
be
cut
david
had
at
the
time
been
opposed
to
cutting
goggles
as
well
as
her
sneaking
sister
because
goggles
wasn
t
such
a
bad
chap
and
there
was
nothing
against
her
personally
but
he
and
a
small
minority
had
been
overruled
if
carrots
had
sneaked
goggles
might
sneak
next
and
it
was
wiser
to
have
no
truck
at
all
with
the
enemy
s
family
though
goggles
at
this
moment
looked
innocent
enough
with
the
low
sun
shining
through
a
stained
glass
window
on
to
her
spectacles
and
protuberant
eyes
david
felt
that
after
all
it
was
wiser
to
err
on
the
side
of
prudence
than
to
be
led
into
a
course
of
mistaken
kindness
but
it
was
rather
difficult
only
yesterday
she
had
congratulated
him
with
apparent
sincerity
on
his
innings
of
and
had
offered
him
a
visit
to
the
in
the
garden
he
had
been
compelled
by
the
resolution
passed
by
the
conference
to
decline
this
temptation
and
to
say
with
a
stony
face
thank
you
miss
mabel
but
i
can
even
that
was
not
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
vow
he
ought
really
to
have
icily
raised
his
cap
and
said
nothing
whatever
it
was
part
of
the
career
of
goggles
and
carrots
to
make
the
service
what
is
called
bright
which
meant
there
was
a
good
deal
of
singing
this
presupposed
in
order
to
ensure
a
proper
performance
a
certain
amount
of
these
practices
were
not
allowed
to
take
the
place
of
other
but
were
held
in
the
less
useful
hours
of
in
compensation
the
members
of
the
choir
were
rewarded
with
an
extra
towards
the
end
of
term
if
they
had
missed
no
practices
and
before
now
goggles
had
been
known
when
a
boy
had
missed
say
only
one
practice
to
falsify
the
register
and
send
up
his
name
to
her
father
as
an
unremitting
attendant
which
did
not
look
as
if
she
was
a
bad
chap
but
on
the
other
hand
she
was
sister
to
her
sister
about
whom
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
she
have
sneaked
ferrers
had
seen
her
in
richmond
and
immediately
on
his
return
he
had
been
summoned
and
dealt
with
probably
all
girls
were
dishonourable
and
so
it
was
best
to
cut
goggles
too
and
it
was
not
as
if
carrots
was
only
a
kid
who
must
be
taught
the
proper
ways
of
she
was
quite
grown
up
and
very
likely
would
never
see
fifteen
again
the
nunc
dimittis
though
they
were
a
long
way
off
being
dismissed
yet
a
slight
alleviation
happened
here
for
the
wind
of
the
organ
suddenly
ran
out
with
a
wail
and
a
wheeze
and
was
started
again
by
the
blower
in
so
feverish
a
haste
that
the
notes
shook
and
trembled
as
he
pumped
soon
after
in
privacy
of
kneeling
david
was
able
to
peep
into
the
and
observe
with
delight
that
the
monarch
was
browsing
on
he
appeared
to
have
an
excellent
appetite
and
was
swiftly
put
away
again
as
they
rose
for
the
hymn
instead
anthem
was
announced
by
the
head
without
further
particularisation
since
there
was
but
one
but
it
seemed
scarcely
credible
that
any
one
could
have
been
so
mean
as
to
couple
an
anthem
to
that
unending
psalm
no
doubt
this
was
reprisal
on
the
part
of
goggles
and
carrots
it
must
be
duly
considered
afterwards
david
s
mind
had
been
pretty
busy
with
these
trains
of
thought
and
his
attention
to
the
service
from
a
devotional
point
of
view
intermittent
and
fragmentary
more
than
once
he
stole
a
glance
at
bags
as
a
general
reconnoitring
measure
it
appeared
from
a
certain
gingerliness
in
bags
s
movements
when
he
sat
down
or
stood
that
he
was
not
quite
comfortable
and
since
accounts
had
been
squared
between
them
david
hoped
he
had
not
hurt
him
much
the
kick
in
the
main
was
meant
to
be
symbolical
and
he
determined
that
unless
bags
actually
wanted
to
be
nasty
he
would
make
it
up
directly
after
chapel
david
s
cheerful
and
eager
soul
hated
prolonged
or
nagging
warfare
and
since
bags
had
been
paid
for
his
injudicious
behaviour
during
school
that
afternoon
david
was
quite
ready
to
proclaim
or
assent
to
a
cordial
naturally
if
bags
did
not
want
he
should
have
as
much
as
he
wished
for
and
during
the
prayer
for
parliament
in
which
it
was
frankly
impossible
for
a
proper
boy
of
thirteen
to
take
any
interest
david
planned
a
raid
or
two
bags
was
like
a
girl
in
some
ways
he
couldn
t
stand
creeping
things
so
if
he
didn
t
want
he
should
find
in
his
bed
without
any
more
ado
about
the
matter
these
were
easily
procured
they
lived
in
the
of
a
disused
lavatory
and
by
turning
on
a
tap
horrible
specimens
descended
wriggling
into
the
basin
he
had
put
two
in
bags
s
bed
once
before
with
the
splendid
effect
that
bags
spent
the
night
on
the
floor
in
his
rather
than
encounter
them
whereas
when
he
had
tried
the
same
trick
on
david
david
had
smashed
the
intruders
to
death
with
his
slipper
and
slept
soundly
amid
the
mutilated
corpses
yes
they
should
be
about
bags
s
path
and
about
his
his
should
find
them
in
his
pockets
and
his
boots
until
he
abandoned
nagging
warfare
and
either
came
to
blows
and
had
done
with
it
or
made
peace
like
a
gentleman
david
had
fought
bags
once
before
and
bags
did
not
want
any
more
on
that
occasion
and
said
so
david
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
not
want
any
more
either
and
his
face
for
the
next
few
days
had
been
notably
more
lumpy
than
bags
s
but
by
virtue
of
an
extra
ounce
of
grit
he
had
not
said
so
amen
sang
david
fervently
looking
as
if
he
had
just
come
down
from
an
italian
picture
of
singing
angels
but
he
forgot
that
the
last
amen
went
down
instead
of
remaining
on
the
same
note
afforded
more
opportunities
for
meditation
for
he
swiftly
decided
that
he
could
not
understand
what
the
head
was
driving
at
there
was
another
and
most
important
at
the
end
of
this
week
and
until
that
was
over
he
would
not
be
able
to
smoke
at
all
because
he
had
made
a
vow
that
if
he
made
more
than
ten
runs
in
the
last
match
he
would
not
smoke
for
ten
days
this
vow
he
had
written
out
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
buried
it
in
a
below
a
certain
tree
on
the
whole
that
had
been
rather
a
clever
vow
since
to
begin
with
he
did
not
like
smoking
at
all
and
only
did
it
because
just
now
it
was
the
smart
thing
to
do
but
a
vow
of
this
importance
which
he
would
have
to
tell
the
smoking
club
about
when
they
met
on
tuesday
would
certainly
be
held
sacred
even
by
stone
who
was
the
dashing
president
of
the
club
and
often
smoked
a
cigarette
right
through
without
minding
though
it
was
only
incumbent
on
members
to
smoke
half
a
cigarette
at
these
meetings
but
they
had
to
do
that
without
being
sick
and
if
you
were
sick
three
times
you
were
turned
out
of
the
club
furthermore
as
an
additional
cleverness
in
the
vow
he
had
been
told
by
a
fellow
at
a
public
school
that
smoking
was
bad
for
the
eye
and
even
when
people
were
quite
old
as
at
oxford
or
cambridge
they
never
smoked
when
they
were
in
training
again
if
his
vow
was
not
accepted
as
a
reason
for
abstention
he
would
have
to
resign
but
that
he
really
did
not
mind
about
for
it
was
stupid
to
put
smoking
before
cricket
also
the
secret
of
the
smoking
club
had
somehow
leaked
out
and
now
that
the
badge
was
no
longer
a
mystery
to
those
who
did
not
belong
half
the
fun
was
gone
this
badge
was
a
piece
of
bent
into
the
shape
of
for
smoking
club
and
when
they
were
engaged
in
these
sacred
operations
it
had
to
be
worn
in
the
buttonhole
otherwise
there
was
a
fine
of
a
halfpenny
which
helped
to
fill
the
coffers
of
the
club
and
was
spent
in
cigarettes
but
only
last
week
bags
who
did
not
belong
happened
to
see
his
badge
and
said
casually
hullo
you
belong
to
the
sick
club
do
you
this
was
annoying
because
it
not
only
implied
a
knowledge
of
the
club
but
darkly
alluded
to
its
rules
david
had
been
ready
enough
on
this
occasion
and
had
answered
smartly
if
you
belonged
to
an
it
would
be
the
sneak
club
and
the
shot
had
gone
home
for
bags
had
sneaked
once
of
course
it
was
ever
so
long
ago
the
term
before
last
before
bags
had
become
a
decent
chap
and
the
incident
had
been
suitably
buried
but
the
thought
of
its
possible
resuscitation
made
bags
extremely
civil
for
several
days
certain
words
the
horror
of
sin
the
infamy
of
evil
caught
david
s
ears
at
this
moment
and
he
attended
for
a
little
it
seemed
to
him
rather
poor
stuff
and
why
the
head
should
sway
about
and
shout
like
that
was
impossible
to
conjecture
but
it
gave
him
a
hint
and
david
closely
listening
intended
to
reproduce
some
of
it
in
dormitory
that
night
a
made
an
admirable
surplice
and
a
pair
of
trousers
hung
over
the
shoulders
would
make
a
ripping
stole
he
himself
would
be
the
head
as
he
had
thought
of
it
and
stone
and
ferrers
should
be
stuffed
with
pillows
to
represent
goggles
and
carrots
with
his
bed
as
the
organ
david
would
march
the
whole
way
down
the
dormitory
after
the
matron
had
gone
with
the
head
s
rocking
walk
and
some
for
a
beard
preceded
by
a
small
boy
carrying
a
poker
then
suddenly
the
head
s
voice
changed
it
became
extraordinarily
solemn
and
beautiful
as
it
did
sometimes
when
he
read
to
them
and
the
words
were
beautiful
and
they
affected
david
in
that
puzzling
incomprehensible
manner
in
which
words
did
words
and
the
pictures
dim
and
only
that
they
produced
in
his
mind
often
had
that
effect
on
him
they
gave
him
a
sort
of
homesick
yearning
and
an
ache
as
if
his
mind
was
hungry
and
it
was
clear
that
what
he
was
saying
moved
the
head
in
the
same
sort
of
way
his
voice
shook
and
grew
lower
yet
reminding
david
of
something
he
had
felt
once
when
he
woke
early
and
heard
the
chirruping
of
birds
before
daybreak
so
prepare
to
be
men
he
said
and
when
manhood
dawns
on
you
let
it
dawn
on
you
as
on
the
clean
dewy
grass
with
birds
singing
in
your
hearts
and
innocence
still
looking
from
your
eyes
never
contemplate
evil
and
the
desire
of
it
will
fade
from
you
run
away
from
it
if
by
staying
near
it
you
would
yield
and
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
whatsoever
things
are
of
good
report
think
on
those
david
gave
a
little
gulp
not
only
were
these
beautiful
words
but
they
meant
something
but
the
sermon
was
over
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
remember
that
in
a
few
minutes
now
he
would
be
having
tea
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
while
the
wretched
dubs
was
doing
the
head
the
honour
to
wait
on
him
it
had
been
jam
to
see
the
head
stamp
on
that
book
and
with
any
luck
the
fragments
of
it
would
be
in
the
grate
of
the
museum
david
determined
to
get
up
early
and
see
what
it
was
about
it
was
in
french
which
was
a
bore
but
it
was
worth
while
even
at
the
trouble
of
looking
out
heaps
of
words
to
see
what
it
was
that
had
made
the
head
in
such
a
wax
or
had
it
something
to
do
with
the
things
the
head
told
them
they
must
run
away
from
rum
old
bird
the
head
but
he
did
say
jolly
things
sometimes
chapter
iii
the
tea
which
with
the
head
s
compliments
lowe
provided
after
chapel
was
an
apotheosis
of
tea
the
head
s
dinner
was
going
on
simultaneously
and
the
most
delicious
remainders
were
brought
in
from
it
for
the
boys
ending
with
an
ice
pudding
that
at
its
entrance
was
practically
untouched
though
soon
there
was
nothing
left
to
touch
it
had
really
been
worth
while
to
voyage
at
such
peril
over
unknown
seas
and
lands
if
this
was
to
be
the
eventful
haven
and
when
at
the
end
ferrers
proposed
the
health
of
iconium
his
toast
was
drunk
with
acclamation
thereafter
was
a
little
quiet
ragging
but
david
had
not
joined
in
this
for
when
he
was
seized
by
somebody
he
had
said
in
plethoric
tones
for
god
s
sake
don
t
bend
me
or
i
shall
be
sick
and
for
fear
of
that
untoward
result
he
had
been
left
alone
bags
also
was
not
disposed
to
active
exercise
and
david
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
be
agreeable
according
to
his
resolution
in
chapel
i
say
i
hope
i
didn
t
hurt
you
bags
he
said
you
see
i
had
to
kick
you
just
once
to
make
it
all
square
is
it
bags
looked
sideways
at
david
with
his
shallow
eyes
before
he
answered
oh
rather
he
said
it
wasn
t
anything
you
hardly
touched
this
was
surprising
for
david
had
the
distinct
impression
in
his
toe
and
instep
that
this
particular
kick
had
been
a
juicy
one
right
oh
then
he
said
i
say
there
s
one
piece
of
cake
left
shall
we
halve
it
couldn
t
said
bags
getting
up
though
he
could
not
be
bent
david
thought
that
a
cautious
attack
might
defeat
the
one
piece
of
cake
and
strategically
accomplished
this
but
it
was
funny
that
bags
should
not
have
tried
too
and
for
a
moment
he
had
suspicions
it
is
then
he
asked
oh
rather
said
bags
and
your
lip
s
all
right
isn
t
it
blazes
quite
clean
i
mean
i
think
the
head
only
gassed
about
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
will
you
swear
i
washed
it
if
necessary
oh
yes
said
david
gosh
i
m
full
and
i
m
going
to
preach
in
dormitory
and
trousers
for
a
stole
i
can
remember
lots
of
the
oh
may
i
come
asked
bags
right
but
don
t
be
sarcastic
and
spoil
the
show
it
ll
be
in
my
rather
not
said
bags
moving
away
may
i
be
goggles
or
carrots
sorry
stone
and
ferrers
have
bagged
them
but
you
might
blow
the
organ
and
let
it
go
out
with
a
squeak
same
as
it
did
this
oh
thanks
that
ll
be
ripping
said
bags
beginning
to
practise
squeaking
in
a
realistic
and
manner
now
bags
s
mater
was
as
all
the
world
knew
a
jewess
bags
had
volunteered
that
information
himself
on
his
first
day
at
school
adding
loftily
that
she
was
of
the
tribe
of
judah
this
if
it
was
meant
to
be
impressive
had
singularly
failed
in
its
object
and
the
only
consequence
was
that
for
his
first
term
or
so
bags
had
been
the
butt
of
various
embarrassing
questions
as
to
whether
he
was
allowed
to
eat
sausages
or
observed
other
levitical
injunctions
david
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
not
joined
in
these
painful
catechisms
holding
that
it
wasn
t
fair
to
consider
a
fellow
responsible
for
his
mater
but
he
had
always
secretly
felt
that
this
might
account
for
there
being
something
rather
odd
about
bags
for
bags
had
a
retentive
and
vindictive
memory
and
was
ever
on
the
to
repay
antique
scores
though
other
people
would
have
forgotten
all
about
them
it
was
therefore
not
likely
that
he
would
have
overlooked
a
scene
so
recent
as
this
kick
and
after
bags
had
gone
david
said
to
himself
that
he
was
being
too
infernally
genial
jolly
sounding
word
which
he
had
just
deceive
the
wary
in
fact
though
bags
had
definitely
agreed
that
it
should
be
david
was
subconsciously
a
little
suspicious
of
him
and
this
attitude
was
confirmed
by
bags
having
said
that
that
one
beautiful
kick
had
hardly
touched
him
it
absolutely
must
have
there
was
no
mistaking
the
quality
of
the
touch
but
he
did
not
dwell
on
it
much
should
bags
prove
to
be
bellicose
still
in
spite
of
the
treaty
he
felt
the
utmost
confidence
that
he
could
deal
with
him
david
woke
next
morning
very
early
with
a
sense
of
immense
interest
in
things
in
general
it
was
still
only
the
hour
of
faint
and
early
dawn
and
he
lay
quiet
a
little
while
drawing
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
and
clasping
his
legs
with
his
bare
arms
in
order
to
multiply
the
consciousness
of
limbs
and
body
and
life
generally
just
behind
him
was
the
open
window
through
which
the
fresh
breeze
of
morning
came
coolly
ruffling
his
hair
and
on
each
side
the
varnished
of
the
walls
of
his
cubicle
gay
with
wonderful
decoration
his
face
was
turned
to
the
partition
close
to
his
bed
and
thus
the
earliest
object
that
his
eye
fell
on
was
the
school
eleven
which
he
had
won
last
week
hung
on
a
nail
on
another
nail
beside
it
was
his
watch
and
chain
his
father
s
birthday
present
to
him
on
attaining
the
immense
age
of
thirteen
and
on
the
same
nail
though
not
conjoined
with
this
jewellery
the
mystic
badge
of
the
smoking
club
a
little
farther
on
was
another
gift
of
his
father
s
a
small
chromolithographic
reproduction
of
the
sistine
madonna
by
a
fellow
called
raphael
whose
name
somehow
appealed
to
david
though
the
picture
itself
was
rather
pi
and
close
beside
that
a
photograph
of
carrots
exchanged
for
one
of
his
in
those
happier
days
before
she
sneaked
now
carrots
s
intelligent
features
were
turned
face
to
the
wall
and
david
wondered
whether
she
ought
not
to
be
deposed
altogether
anyhow
it
had
been
carrots
who
had
asked
him
for
his
photograph
promising
hers
the
exchange
had
come
from
her
side
then
there
was
a
photograph
of
ferrers
major
unframed
but
tacked
to
the
wall
and
one
of
hughes
david
s
great
friend
who
had
left
a
year
before
and
gone
to
marchester
where
david
hoped
to
follow
him
at
the
michaelmas
term
hughes
was
altogether
godlike
and
david
adored
him
then
came
a
small
fretwork
bracket
homemade
in
the
holidays
with
a
sort
of
petticoat
of
crimson
silk
hanging
round
the
edge
of
its
shelf
on
which
was
placed
a
small
china
lamb
lying
down
among
amazing
flowers
which
david
assured
his
friends
was
jolly
he
cuddled
his
knees
for
a
little
while
contemplating
these
precious
things
and
forbearing
to
turn
round
and
look
the
other
way
because
even
more
agreeable
objects
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
photograph
of
hughes
would
meet
his
eyes
there
and
the
zest
for
them
was
to
be
sharpened
by
abstention
to
begin
with
there
was
the
chair
which
last
night
had
made
so
perfect
a
pulpit
and
even
the
sight
of
his
trousers
now
lying
on
it
which
last
night
had
made
so
lovely
a
stole
would
make
him
giggle
again
at
the
thought
of
his
highly
successful
sermon
there
also
was
the
photograph
of
the
two
elevens
in
last
week
s
match
and
more
precious
still
a
snapshot
of
himself
standing
at
the
wicket
which
ferrers
s
sister
had
taken
had
developed
and
had
sent
to
him
the
very
next
day
jolly
cute
of
her
thought
david
he
longed
to
turn
round
and
assure
himself
by
ocular
evidence
of
the
permanence
of
these
things
but
teasing
himself
went
on
with
his
enumeration
of
them
there
was
his
and
one
batting
glove
which
he
had
bought
most
people
did
not
rise
to
gloves
at
all
indeed
stone
s
glove
was
the
only
other
one
in
the
school
and
for
the
moment
the
idea
of
staggering
humanity
by
purchasing
a
glove
also
with
aunt
eleanor
s
five
shillings
flashed
across
him
probably
nobody
at
helmsworth
had
ever
had
two
before
fancy
being
snapshotted
with
two
gloves
then
there
was
a
filled
with
the
yellow
dust
from
the
in
the
grounds
which
he
had
collected
and
labelled
and
lastly
there
was
his
in
which
ever
ineffectually
trying
to
climb
up
its
slippery
steep
sides
were
the
monarch
of
the
glen
and
his
spouse
david
could
resist
that
no
longer
rolled
round
in
bed
and
got
up
good
morning
monarch
he
said
politely
and
then
he
stopped
there
were
two
or
three
in
the
basin
and
a
strawberry
but
otherwise
it
was
empty
there
was
no
monarch
there
was
no
wife
for
the
moment
david
could
not
believe
it
he
felt
that
they
must
be
there
and
that
for
some
curious
sleepy
reason
although
he
was
not
sleepy
he
could
not
see
them
again
and
again
he
turned
over
the
leaves
and
looked
underneath
the
strawberry
as
if
the
monarch
had
been
made
little
by
his
meal
like
alice
in
wonderland
but
there
was
no
sign
of
them
then
he
searched
about
his
cubicle
scrutinising
the
varnished
walls
examining
the
floor
searching
in
his
blankets
in
case
they
had
strayed
there
and
all
the
time
he
felt
the
futility
of
this
for
he
was
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
neither
the
monarch
nor
his
lady
could
have
climbed
the
glazed
ascent
of
the
sides
of
the
washing
basin
often
had
he
watched
them
attempting
to
do
so
even
the
gradual
slope
at
the
base
was
beyond
the
adhesive
power
of
their
feet
and
as
for
the
precipice
of
the
sides
themselves
they
were
hopelessly
incapable
of
surmounting
it
they
not
get
out
themselves
some
one
must
then
a
sudden
suspicion
struck
him
and
he
went
softly
and
barefooted
to
the
far
end
of
the
dormitory
where
bags
slept
and
shook
him
awake
this
had
to
be
accomplished
with
silent
caution
since
no
boy
was
allowed
to
leave
his
cubicle
till
the
sounded
i
say
bags
have
you
taken
my
stags
he
whispered
if
you
tell
me
you
have
and
give
them
up
i
swear
i
won
t
do
anything
to
bags
sat
up
in
bed
and
yawned
heavily
to
give
himself
time
to
think
do
you
really
think
i
would
touch
those
filthy
crawlers
he
asked
doesn
t
matter
what
i
think
said
david
i
want
to
know
if
you
bags
was
considerably
astounded
by
david
s
having
so
instantly
suspected
him
considering
that
he
had
agreed
to
yesterday
evening
well
then
i
didn
t
he
said
so
that
s
flat
where
did
you
put
them
last
night
in
my
basin
said
david
suddenly
bags
saw
the
stout
figure
of
the
matron
in
the
just
outside
the
dormitory
while
david
facing
towards
him
could
not
see
her
if
he
could
detain
david
in
talk
here
for
a
minute
it
was
more
than
likely
that
she
would
hear
voices
and
find
him
out
of
his
cubicle
in
which
case
she
would
certainly
report
him
to
the
head
he
had
not
forgotten
about
the
incident
as
they
went
into
chapel
last
night
and
the
temptation
was
too
strong
he
laughed
silently
into
his
what
are
you
laughing
at
said
david
raising
his
voice
what
s
the
blooming
joke
bags
did
not
answer
and
david
repeated
his
question
at
that
bags
saw
that
the
matron
had
heard
the
talking
and
was
advancing
in
her
felt
slippers
up
the
dormitory
she
was
already
past
david
s
cubicle
and
retreat
was
cut
off
he
sank
back
gently
into
bed
cave
he
whispered
there
s
glanders
coming
and
can
fly
fancy
not
knowing
that
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
sank
apparently
into
a
refreshing
sleep
david
turned
round
glanders
was
coming
straight
up
the
dormitory
and
had
already
seen
him
since
there
was
no
hope
of
concealment
he
went
out
to
meet
his
fate
out
of
your
cubicle
before
said
glanders
bleakly
i
shall
report
you
master
blaize
not
the
first
time
david
got
back
into
bed
again
in
a
very
different
mood
from
that
in
which
he
had
awoke
half
an
hour
ago
the
week
was
beginning
just
about
as
badly
as
it
could
and
the
sight
of
his
and
failed
to
console
him
in
the
least
or
bring
back
the
sense
of
his
happy
awaking
he
had
two
maps
of
the
second
missionary
journey
to
make
he
had
to
stop
in
between
twelve
and
one
when
he
should
have
been
practising
at
the
nets
to
learn
his
catechism
the
monarch
and
his
wife
had
vanished
and
he
was
to
be
reported
for
being
out
of
his
cubicle
before
the
sounded
that
was
a
serious
breach
of
and
glanders
might
have
gone
further
when
she
so
feelingly
reminded
him
that
this
would
not
be
the
first
time
either
for
it
would
not
be
the
second
either
on
the
last
occasion
the
head
had
told
him
precisely
what
would
happen
if
it
occurred
again
the
colours
of
the
new
had
faded
the
glove
looked
ridiculous
and
the
was
like
the
house
of
some
one
lately
dead
he
felt
furious
and
exasperated
against
fate
and
it
was
bitter
to
be
reminded
by
bags
that
could
fly
in
a
general
way
he
supposed
he
had
known
it
too
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
monarch
and
his
wife
would
dream
of
such
a
thing
then
there
was
a
good
fine
caning
to
look
forward
to
it
hurt
hideously
at
the
time
and
you
couldn
t
hold
a
bat
all
day
afterwards
because
your
hands
were
so
sore
there
was
an
awful
legend
too
in
the
school
that
the
head
had
once
broken
a
fellow
s
finger
and
who
knew
that
he
would
not
repeat
that
savage
feat
first
one
hand
then
the
other
and
the
same
bruised
and
smarting
hands
again
just
in
the
same
place
and
rising
there
the
sounded
and
it
was
necessary
to
get
up
it
was
just
the
sort
of
morning
too
that
made
a
fellow
wild
with
mysterious
delight
if
things
were
going
well
but
when
things
were
black
it
seemed
an
added
insult
that
the
sunlight
and
the
sky
were
in
such
excellent
spirits
there
was
the
in
the
field
outside
whistling
as
he
put
up
the
nets
for
practice
but
there
would
be
no
practice
for
david
instead
from
twelve
to
one
he
would
be
making
maps
and
staring
at
the
catechism
and
his
hands
would
be
tender
and
bruised
and
lumpy
and
there
were
no
stags
to
cater
for
he
went
down
to
his
bath
feeling
utterly
wretched
and
dispirited
with
that
completeness
of
emotion
that
only
children
know
who
are
unable
to
look
beyond
the
present
and
immediate
future
the
happiness
or
misery
of
which
possesses
them
entirely
other
boys
were
splashing
about
and
throwing
sponges
at
each
other
and
he
was
hailed
with
the
derisive
taunts
indicating
general
good
spirits
and
friendliness
hullo
here
s
blazes
what
reported
again
blaize
don
t
bully
me
sir
the
other
hand
whack
whack
i
say
blazes
how
s
the
monarch
flown
away
bags
says
dirty
vermin
anyhow
so
what
s
the
odds
come
and
practise
at
no
net
at
twelve
with
me
and
david
chucked
his
sponge
into
his
bath
and
kicked
off
his
slippers
can
t
catechism
to
learn
thanks
to
oh
yes
so
you
have
i
expect
you
wouldn
t
be
able
to
hold
a
bat
either
never
mind
buck
up
all
the
same
in
a
hundred
years
besides
hughes
was
caned
two
mornings
running
last
year
and
he
didn
t
blub
even
at
the
second
the
bags
entered
at
this
moment
i
say
rough
luck
he
said
to
david
i
warned
you
as
soon
as
i
saw
glanders
found
the
monarch
yet
this
was
rather
too
much
david
felt
suddenly
sure
that
bags
was
at
the
bottom
of
all
his
misfortunes
and
already
goaded
by
sympathy
turned
on
him
no
i
haven
t
he
shouted
and
i
m
jolly
well
going
to
search
your
cubicle
i
believe
you
stole
him
look
here
you
chaps
i
believe
bags
took
the
monarch
and
i
believe
he
saw
glanders
coming
when
i
was
talking
to
him
and
didn
t
warn
stone
took
his
brown
head
out
of
the
towel
in
which
he
had
been
rubbing
it
why
what
evidence
he
asked
unless
you
re
too
blooming
omniscient
to
want
evidence
said
bags
because
you
re
a
sneak
because
i
jolly
well
hurt
you
last
night
and
you
said
i
hadn
t
to
put
me
off
the
scent
said
david
with
a
sudden
inspiration
why
you
ve
got
a
bruise
as
big
as
a
football
he
cried
pointing
to
the
injured
part
of
bags
s
anatomy
and
yet
you
said
it
didn
t
hurt
it
must
have
hurt
it
s
all
rot
to
say
it
didn
t
and
you
said
it
was
in
order
to
put
me
off
the
bosh
that
s
not
evidence
said
ferrers
whose
father
was
a
and
was
much
looked
up
to
on
points
of
that
s
only
your
blooming
well
it
would
be
evidence
if
i
found
the
monarch
in
his
beastly
cubicle
said
david
or
perhaps
you
d
say
that
stags
can
fly
and
that
the
monarch
had
only
flown
this
was
sarcasm
of
the
deepest
dye
and
produced
its
due
effect
on
all
the
boys
who
in
various
stages
of
undress
surrounded
the
two
except
stone
who
never
could
understand
what
sarcasm
meant
oh
rot
blazes
said
he
at
that
rate
the
monarch
may
have
flown
to
my
cubicle
but
i
m
not
going
to
have
you
search
it
and
turn
everything
upside
down
for
the
sake
of
a
sickly
the
man
of
law
considered
the
points
i
don
t
see
why
you
shouldn
t
make
a
challenge
out
of
it
blazes
he
said
disregarding
the
obtuse
stone
if
you
re
so
certain
of
it
you
can
challenge
bags
to
allow
you
to
search
his
cubicle
an
if
you
don
t
find
the
monarch
there
he
gives
you
three
cuts
of
the
hardest
with
a
and
immediately
david
was
standing
in
his
bath
and
slipping
plumped
down
into
it
heaving
out
solid
water
sorry
you
fellows
he
said
to
those
who
were
wettest
right
then
i
bags
had
moved
away
in
the
general
stampede
caused
by
david
s
plunge
and
on
the
instant
with
fresh
suspicions
teeming
in
his
head
david
jumped
out
and
got
between
him
and
the
door
of
the
big
i
say
bags
you
haven
t
had
your
bath
he
said
and
were
you
going
back
without
it
aren
t
you
going
to
have
a
bath
not
feeling
dirty
anyhow
i
challenge
do
you
accept
it
bags
took
off
his
oh
you
thought
i
was
going
back
to
dormitory
to
put
them
in
your
cubicle
again
did
you
he
said
it
just
happens
to
be
my
bath
there
by
the
well
but
do
you
accept
cried
david
executing
a
sort
of
indian
round
him
no
said
bags
i
don
t
want
to
give
you
three
with
a
as
we
made
it
up
last
night
and
i
don
t
want
you
turning
everything
upside
down
in
my
ferrers
put
on
his
with
the
solemnity
of
a
judge
assuming
the
then
it
simply
proves
the
plaintiff
s
case
if
you
won
t
have
your
cubicle
searched
he
said
it
s
all
rot
about
your
not
wanting
to
whack
blazes
because
it
was
last
night
he
s
challenged
you
it
isn
t
any
longer
state
of
war
ferrers
was
in
his
element
and
it
seemed
to
the
court
generally
even
as
to
him
that
never
at
the
old
bailey
had
the
net
been
woven
in
such
impenetrable
fashion
round
the
most
palpable
criminal
bags
too
felt
that
but
the
net
that
really
enmeshed
him
was
of
very
different
sort
from
what
it
appeared
to
be
certainly
he
was
in
a
hole
but
not
the
hole
that
every
one
thought
he
was
in
the
majesty
of
the
law
proceeded
if
you
don
t
accept
the
challenge
said
ferrers
it
proves
you
are
the
plaintiff
continued
to
dance
i
ll
let
you
give
me
six
cuts
if
i
don
t
find
the
monarch
in
your
cubicle
he
shouted
you
must
be
guilty
if
you
refuse
six
mustn
t
he
ferrers
ferrers
tore
his
sock
in
trying
to
put
it
on
to
a
wet
foot
not
for
a
cert
he
said
bags
is
beastly
cunning
he
may
be
running
you
up
to
a
higher
then
i
ll
let
him
have
twelve
cuts
said
david
feeling
absolutely
sure
about
it
if
i
may
search
his
cubicle
and
not
find
the
monarch
oh
and
search
his
too
he
added
quickly
conjecturing
a
perfectly
demoniacal
piece
of
cunning
on
the
part
of
bags
bags
stepped
out
of
his
bath
with
dignity
feeling
there
was
no
escape
then
i
accept
blazes
challenge
of
three
cuts
he
said
just
to
show
i
didn
t
want
to
run
him
up
if
i
did
i
should
take
done
said
david
i
ll
go
and
search
at
once
there
s
another
quarter
of
an
hour
before
school
i
may
as
well
search
his
first
no
not
there
oh
blow
what
shall
i
say
if
glanders
finds
me
in
his
cubicle
again
i
know
bags
is
in
the
and
wants
his
liniment
if
glanders
doesn
t
think
that
likely
she
can
come
and
look
at
now
bags
s
dilemma
the
net
in
which
he
was
really
involved
was
this
he
had
lain
awake
for
two
hours
last
night
in
savage
anger
with
david
whom
in
secret
boyish
fashion
he
adored
and
who
had
been
so
beastly
to
him
open
vengeance
was
out
of
the
question
because
if
it
came
to
a
fight
david
was
more
than
his
match
and
thus
his
revenge
for
that
infernal
kick
must
be
done
stealthily
plan
after
plan
suggested
itself
to
him
but
none
were
suitable
until
he
thought
of
the
very
simple
one
of
taking
the
monarch
and
his
wife
which
as
he
knew
quite
well
lived
in
david
s
at
night
that
was
accomplished
very
easily
without
disturbing
their
owner
but
a
few
hours
later
he
was
awakened
by
david
himself
who
had
conceived
the
revolting
suspicion
that
bags
had
done
precisely
what
he
had
done
then
at
the
same
moment
almost
while
he
was
hot
with
indignation
at
being
justly
accused
he
had
seen
the
matron
at
the
far
end
of
the
dormitory
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
get
david
into
further
trouble
this
too
had
been
successfully
accomplished
and
david
would
certainly
be
caned
after
morning
school
and
then
bags
began
to
regret
his
success
his
affection
for
david
whom
no
one
could
help
liking
even
when
he
was
being
beastly
and
his
sense
of
his
own
meanness
pointed
the
finger
of
scorn
at
him
and
having
ensured
david
a
caning
he
wished
he
had
not
at
any
rate
taken
his
beloved
as
well
so
lingering
behind
till
the
rest
of
the
dormitory
had
gone
to
the
he
induced
the
monarch
and
his
wife
who
were
scratching
about
in
his
to
crawl
on
to
his
sponge
and
as
he
passed
david
s
cubicle
he
had
shaken
them
off
on
to
his
bed
then
had
come
the
complication
he
had
been
forced
eventually
by
ferrers
s
resistless
legal
acumen
to
accept
the
challenge
and
he
would
have
to
whack
david
for
any
one
might
search
his
cubicle
till
doomsday
and
never
find
a
there
and
each
one
of
those
cuts
would
be
unjust
he
had
taken
the
and
david
was
perfectly
right
the
fact
of
having
put
them
back
did
not
ease
a
troubled
conscience
david
rushed
upstairs
again
to
his
dormitory
and
with
clatter
and
publicity
went
straight
to
bags
s
cubicle
and
began
a
violent
and
intimate
search
he
searched
in
his
pockets
he
examined
the
lower
tray
of
his
he
peered
behind
pictures
and
ransacked
the
receptacle
usually
called
the
where
bags
kept
and
but
nowhere
was
there
the
faintest
trace
of
the
monarch
to
be
seen
these
operations
glanders
david
observed
that
she
was
observing
her
bleak
and
stony
eyes
and
just
as
he
was
very
busy
she
approached
do
you
want
to
be
reported
twice
master
blaize
she
asked
oh
certainly
if
you
like
said
david
but
crabtree
asked
me
to
get
his
and
why
can
t
master
crabtree
get
it
himself
then
asked
glanders
and
why
does
he
want
liniment
oh
don
t
be
tedious
said
david
he
can
t
get
it
himself
because
he
hasn
t
got
any
clothes
on
and
is
afraid
of
shocking
you
and
he
wants
it
because
he
has
got
a
bruise
which
you
can
see
if
you
aren
t
afraid
of
being
shocked
anything
else
i
can
tell
you
muffled
laughter
sounded
from
various
directions
as
glanders
sniffed
which
was
her
congenital
way
of
acknowledging
the
legality
of
doubtful
proceedings
and
david
finished
his
search
turning
over
the
pillows
of
bags
s
bed
without
further
hindrance
but
there
was
no
monarch
to
be
found
and
he
had
to
go
back
to
the
to
report
that
he
could
find
no
liniment
and
had
lost
his
challenge
this
was
depressing
because
the
beloved
monarch
was
still
missing
also
his
wife
the
hope
of
the
race
and
because
the
loss
of
the
challenge
meant
three
nasty
cuts
from
bags
and
his
and
the
head
was
going
to
let
fly
at
him
first
and
there
was
the
to
be
made
and
the
whole
blackness
of
this
dreadful
monday
morning
dissipated
for
the
moment
by
his
certainty
that
he
would
find
the
monarch
overcast
the
sky
again
on
his
way
back
he
passed
his
cubicle
and
pausing
to
throw
his
sponge
and
towel
down
his
eye
fell
on
his
bed
and
there
on
the
blanket
were
two
black
blots
of
familiar
shape
david
gave
a
great
sigh
oh
monarch
and
missus
he
said
affectionately
you
little
the
of
the
royalties
was
to
hand
and
in
a
moment
the
black
pair
were
safe
again
how
they
had
got
on
to
his
blanket
he
did
not
pause
to
think
and
the
three
cuts
due
to
him
were
jolly
cheap
at
the
he
made
but
a
couple
of
leaps
down
the
stairs
to
the
i
say
i
ve
lost
the
challenge
bags
he
said
but
i
ve
found
the
monarch
he
was
on
my
blankets
and
so
was
she
say
i
m
sorry
i
suspected
you
when
ll
you
take
your
cuts
bags
s
inconvenient
conscience
and
affection
gave
him
a
nasty
prod
at
this
if
david
had
only
not
said
he
was
sorry
he
suspected
him
he
would
not
have
felt
so
on
the
other
hand
it
was
dangerous
to
try
to
stifle
his
internal
beastliness
by
magnanimity
since
this
might
lead
to
fresh
suspicions
on
david
s
part
but
magnanimity
salted
with
sarcasm
might
serve
his
turn
oh
i
don
t
want
to
whack
you
he
said
as
you
say
you
were
sorry
as
if
i
should
have
touched
your
filthy
stags
clip
their
wings
and
take
them
to
marchester
next
half
and
see
if
hughes
is
proud
of
his
pal
who
keeps
david
stared
in
blank
surprise
to
forgo
the
pleasure
of
chastisement
was
not
in
the
spirit
of
shylock
oh
well
thanks
awfully
he
said
if
you
don
t
want
to
take
your
cuts
i
m
sure
i
don
t
mind
not
getting
them
but
why
don
t
you
bags
was
struggling
into
his
shirt
and
speech
was
for
the
moment
extinguished
simply
because
the
challenge
was
too
silly
for
words
he
said
as
his
head
emerged
the
repetition
of
this
silly
reason
did
exactly
that
which
bags
desired
should
not
happen
suspicion
vague
and
unformulated
as
yet
again
sprang
up
in
david
s
mind
such
magnanimity
was
simply
childish
i
think
i
ll
take
the
cuts
then
crabtree
he
said
to
mark
the
complete
severance
of
friendly
relations
that
roused
bags
the
rejection
of
his
spurious
but
highly
superior
motives
quite
stifled
the
prods
of
his
inconvenient
conscience
all
right
then
you
shall
he
said
gosh
i
ll
let
into
you
i
ll
put
beef
into
them
blaize
i
ve
got
a
that
ll
do
nicely
i
bet
i
break
it
you
ll
want
some
liniment
the
bell
sounded
at
this
moment
and
the
boys
ran
upstairs
again
to
finish
dressing
and
say
their
prayers
for
the
last
five
minutes
of
these
ten
they
were
bound
to
be
on
their
knees
at
their
bedside
while
glanders
patrolled
the
dormitory
but
with
care
and
discreet
peeping
through
fingers
it
was
possible
to
get
through
some
neglected
dressing
during
the
devotional
five
minutes
and
david
who
was
a
good
deal
behindhand
buttoned
his
collar
put
on
his
tie
and
laced
one
boot
without
being
detected
dutton
was
in
an
unusually
docile
mood
during
this
hour
from
seven
to
eight
and
it
wanted
little
penetration
on
the
part
of
his
pupils
when
they
remembered
the
visit
he
had
done
the
head
the
honour
to
pay
him
last
night
to
guess
the
cause
of
that
david
felt
chagrin
at
the
fact
that
he
had
been
detained
in
the
and
had
not
been
able
to
take
the
dismembered
from
the
grate
to
find
out
what
made
the
head
so
waxy
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
head
who
had
made
dutton
so
mild
indeed
it
had
often
been
a
debated
question
as
to
which
was
really
the
worst
a
caning
or
a
proper
jaw
from
the
head
for
the
hardiest
were
reduced
to
unwilling
tears
by
the
head
s
tongue
when
he
really
chose
to
apply
it
so
convincing
and
dismal
a
picture
could
he
paint
of
a
boy
s
satanic
iniquity
and
the
inevitable
ruin
that
such
courses
fashioned
for
him
in
this
world
and
the
next
but
it
was
a
point
of
honour
not
to
cry
at
any
application
of
the
cane
after
you
were
twelve
kids
might
cry
but
not
elderly
persons
the
cane
might
break
your
hands
and
make
you
set
your
teeth
but
it
was
not
allowable
to
let
it
break
your
spirit
but
a
jaw
broke
your
spirit
into
smithereens
and
no
doubt
that
disintegrating
process
had
happened
to
old
dubs
anything
in
the
way
of
construing
was
sufficient
this
morning
and
the
grammatical
questions
were
mere
child
it
was
already
ten
minutes
to
eight
and
the
school
sergeant
a
whiskered
veteran
who
visited
the
different
during
early
school
with
orders
from
the
head
and
summonses
for
boys
who
had
been
reported
had
already
passed
the
museum
door
without
coming
in
and
david
s
heart
rose
if
glanders
had
reported
him
it
was
quite
certain
that
the
sergeant
would
have
conveyed
the
summons
that
he
was
to
go
to
the
head
after
chapel
to
his
and
yet
he
had
passed
without
delivering
it
from
time
to
time
these
remissions
happened
glanders
occasionally
forgot
to
report
even
when
she
had
promised
it
sometimes
even
in
the
act
of
complaining
the
stoniness
of
her
bosom
relented
then
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
proportionally
greater
owing
to
its
premature
uplifting
there
was
a
tap
on
the
door
and
the
sergeant
entered
saluting
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
to
dutton
handing
him
a
small
slip
of
blue
paper
but
i
forgot
this
as
i
went
dutton
glanced
at
it
blaize
to
go
to
the
head
after
chapel
he
announced
and
david
thought
he
detected
a
faint
smile
showing
the
malicious
glee
of
a
chapel
usually
tedious
was
not
long
enough
that
morning
and
the
psalms
the
lesson
the
hymns
and
the
prayers
passed
in
a
flash
ferrers
as
they
went
out
administered
spurious
consolation
if
you
stick
your
hands
in
cold
water
he
said
it
ll
numb
them
a
bit
i
remember
last
winter
i
held
mine
in
the
snow
for
five
minutes
and
it
didn
t
sting
nearly
so
and
there
s
such
a
sight
of
snow
about
in
july
isn
t
there
said
david
bitterly
ferrers
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
right
then
he
said
feeling
slightly
hurt
and
you
ve
got
your
three
cuts
from
bags
too
haven
t
you
i
bet
bags
lays
a
minute
afterwards
he
was
in
the
awful
presence
even
as
he
entered
he
heard
the
jingle
of
keys
and
when
he
advanced
to
the
table
where
its
occupant
was
looking
vexed
he
saw
that
the
fatal
middle
drawer
was
already
open
that
it
could
have
been
opened
for
any
other
reason
did
not
strike
him
he
supposed
that
his
case
was
already
judged
for
the
moment
the
head
seemed
unaware
of
his
presence
and
continued
to
read
the
letter
that
apparently
annoyed
him
pish
he
said
at
length
in
a
dreadful
voice
and
looking
up
as
he
tore
it
in
fragments
saw
david
ah
blaize
he
said
i
sent
for
i
want
you
to
answer
me
a
question
or
this
looked
as
unpromising
as
possible
the
drawer
was
already
open
but
it
seemed
that
a
jaw
was
coming
first
why
couldn
t
he
cane
him
and
have
done
with
it
thought
the
dejected
david
the
head
rapped
the
table
sharply
question
one
he
said
is
it
the
case
that
my
daughters
have
incurred
the
wrath
of
the
first
form
david
s
head
reeled
at
the
thickness
of
the
troubles
yes
sir
he
said
good
question
two
which
you
need
not
answer
if
any
sense
of
honour
forbid
you
why
have
they
deserved
disgrace
and
why
do
you
join
in
inflicting
it
david
drew
a
long
breath
there
was
no
sense
of
honour
that
would
be
violated
in
telling
the
head
but
to
do
so
was
like
taking
a
high
header
into
unknown
waters
when
it
required
all
the
courage
you
were
possessed
of
to
go
off
a
low
board
into
four
feet
of
familiar
please
sir
it
s
quite
obvious
that
he
had
begun
with
a
rush
and
the
rush
had
carried
him
too
far
carrots
said
the
head
suggestively
lord
how
did
he
know
thought
david
please
sir
we
felt
sure
that
miss
edith
had
got
ferrers
into
a
row
because
she
saw
him
in
richmond
week
before
last
said
david
sneaked
to
me
suggested
the
head
yes
sir
told
i
dare
say
miss
edith
saw
him
said
the
head
but
i
haven
t
the
slightest
idea
whether
she
actually
did
or
not
i
saw
him
myself
miss
edith
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
kindly
tell
your
friends
i
ll
tell
them
said
david
they
ll
be
awfully
glad
why
asked
the
head
again
david
dived
off
the
high
into
dark
waters
because
nobody
wanted
to
think
she
was
a
sneak
sir
he
said
we
always
thought
she
was
a
good
lady
i
mean
the
head
nodded
and
for
the
next
busied
himself
with
the
reports
that
had
come
in
this
morning
i
think
there
was
something
else
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
he
said
yes
here
it
is
you
are
reported
for
being
in
crabtree
s
cubicle
before
this
morning
any
explanation
no
sir
said
david
you
knew
it
was
against
the
rules
yes
the
head
drew
a
large
and
dreaded
book
towards
him
which
contained
a
list
of
all
the
boys
names
and
against
each
the
number
of
times
they
had
been
reported
for
any
misconduct
during
the
current
term
next
the
name
of
blaize
was
that
of
bellingham
and
glancing
at
it
hastily
he
credited
david
with
bellingham
s
stainless
record
i
see
you
have
not
been
reported
before
this
term
he
said
the
moment
he
had
spoken
he
saw
his
mistake
on
the
line
below
was
david
s
record
showing
that
lie
had
been
reported
twice
but
he
waited
for
david
s
answer
he
had
not
considered
what
he
should
do
if
david
accepted
the
statement
but
he
believed
and
wanted
to
prove
to
himself
that
david
would
not
a
joyful
possibility
whirled
through
david
s
mind
it
was
conceivable
that
previous
reports
against
him
had
not
been
entered
and
then
not
really
knowing
why
he
spoke
no
sir
i
have
been
reported
before
he
said
for
the
same
offence
yes
once
before
asked
the
head
feeling
that
his
test
stood
firm
no
sir
twice
said
david
squeezing
his
hands
together
the
head
closed
the
book
he
put
it
in
the
middle
drawer
and
closed
that
also
thank
you
for
telling
me
the
truth
he
said
and
now
i
want
you
as
a
personal
favour
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
they
are
made
for
that
purpose
my
boy
ah
you
are
late
for
breakfast
so
come
and
have
breakfast
with
me
if
you
are
late
for
school
afterwards
explain
to
david
was
joyfully
late
for
school
and
not
only
explained
briefly
then
but
categorically
afterwards
to
his
form
in
the
interval
at
ten
sausages
he
said
and
poached
eggs
and
bacon
and
sloshy
buttered
toast
and
strawberries
gosh
the
head
does
himself
well
he
has
breakfast
like
that
every
day
i
expect
didn
t
i
tuck
in
oh
and
another
thing
carrots
didn
t
sneak
at
all
it
was
the
head
himself
who
saw
ferrers
in
richmond
he
told
me
don
t
believe
it
said
ferrers
who
had
misogynistic
tendencies
well
then
you
ve
got
to
the
head
never
lies
and
so
carrots
is
all
right
and
the
head
s
my
can
t
think
why
he
didn
t
whack
you
though
said
ferrers
perhaps
he
knew
you
were
going
to
catch
it
from
bags
he
s
been
binding
his
too
to
get
a
firm
this
was
slightly
malicious
on
ferrers
s
part
but
what
with
special
tea
last
night
and
special
breakfast
this
morning
and
the
recovery
of
the
monarch
and
the
remission
of
a
caning
he
thought
david
a
little
above
himself
but
even
this
information
about
bags
did
not
appear
to
depress
him
and
he
cocked
his
yellow
head
on
one
side
like
a
meditative
canary
and
his
eyes
as
if
focussing
something
blow
it
if
i
hadn
t
forgotten
all
about
bags
he
said
ferrers
there
s
something
rummy
about
bags
s
show
why
did
bags
not
want
to
take
up
my
challenge
if
he
knew
the
monarch
wasn
t
in
his
cubicle
and
why
didn
t
he
take
a
dozen
cuts
at
me
it
s
all
rot
of
him
to
say
that
he
didn
t
care
about
whacking
me
any
decent
chap
s
mouth
would
water
to
lick
a
fellow
who
had
accused
him
of
the
two
boys
had
wandered
away
in
this
s
interval
between
schools
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
field
below
the
there
david
lay
down
flat
and
ferrers
flicked
the
fallen
flowers
at
his
face
but
he
stopped
at
this
you
see
i
caught
him
a
juicy
hack
too
last
night
continued
david
and
he
s
a
revengeful
beast
in
a
general
perhaps
it
s
the
day
of
atonement
or
something
suggested
ferrers
david
sat
up
no
that
can
t
be
it
he
said
else
he
d
want
to
make
me
atone
hallo
here
he
comes
across
the
field
and
he
suddenly
gave
a
shrill
whistle
through
his
broken
front
tooth
i
say
will
you
back
me
up
whatever
i
say
he
asked
i
ve
thought
of
something
ferrers
peered
across
the
field
he
did
not
often
wear
his
spectacles
since
they
were
supposed
to
give
him
a
resemblance
to
goggles
which
was
the
rise
of
intolerable
comment
so
they
seldom
graced
his
freckled
nose
yes
here
he
comes
he
said
i
ll
back
you
up
but
what
is
it
oh
you
ll
see
said
david
bags
made
a
truculent
approach
swinging
his
he
had
done
all
that
could
humanly
be
done
in
the
easing
of
his
conscience
and
since
he
had
been
literally
unable
to
get
out
of
the
r√¥le
of
executioner
with
honour
he
had
wisely
determined
to
dwell
on
the
bright
side
of
it
and
hit
as
hard
as
he
could
in
the
same
place
i
ll
lick
you
now
if
you
like
he
said
brightly
david
turned
a
cold
face
on
him
thanks
awfully
he
said
but
we
settled
it
for
twelve
you
see
a
good
deal
may
happen
before
twelve
ferrers
and
i
were
just
talking
it
over
wasn
t
it
a
pity
that
ferrers
minor
slept
so
badly
last
night
this
remark
seemed
slightly
to
disconcert
bags
but
he
carried
it
off
with
fair
success
the
point
asked
bags
politely
slapping
his
leg
gently
with
the
oh
thought
you
might
see
it
said
david
the
point
is
that
he
didn
t
go
to
sleep
was
it
ferrers
he
heard
the
clock
strike
one
said
ferrers
at
a
venture
a
shade
of
relief
crossed
bags
s
face
which
the
machiavellian
david
noticed
i
still
don
t
see
the
point
said
bags
david
pursued
his
ripping
plan
no
you
ve
mixed
it
up
you
goat
he
said
to
ferrers
your
minor
told
me
he
awoke
and
heard
the
clock
strike
one
and
lay
awake
till
bang
wide
awake
sorry
of
course
it
was
said
ferrers
backing
his
up
bags
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
walk
away
afraid
i
can
t
see
the
point
he
said
so
i
ll
whack
you
at
twelve
david
lay
down
again
with
complete
unconcern
right
oh
he
said
but
of
course
if
you
ve
got
anything
to
say
about
it
all
you
might
be
wise
to
say
it
yourself
and
not
somebody
else
say
it
for
you
ferrers
minor
hasn
t
told
anybody
yet
except
his
major
and
me
not
yet
you
know
he
added
bags
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
this
unless
he
strolled
away
rather
more
deliberately
than
before
then
david
turned
quickly
to
ferrers
and
whispered
in
his
ear
go
and
find
your
minor
he
said
and
don
t
let
bags
talk
to
him
i
m
going
to
stop
here
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
bags
came
but
what
on
earth
is
it
all
about
asked
ferrers
david
s
eyes
sparkled
with
devilish
intrigue
can
t
explain
now
he
said
just
go
and
stick
on
to
your
minor
and
don
t
let
bags
question
him
there
s
something
ferrers
obeyed
the
bidding
of
the
and
by
a
rapid
flank
march
got
in
front
of
bags
who
called
to
him
but
he
took
no
notice
and
presently
david
saw
him
lead
off
his
minor
like
a
policeman
at
that
his
habitually
seraphic
face
grew
a
shade
more
angelic
and
any
one
who
did
not
know
him
must
have
been
surprised
that
wings
did
not
sprout
from
his
low
slim
shoulders
the
machiavellian
device
which
he
had
practised
had
come
to
him
like
an
inspiration
if
bags
s
conscience
was
clear
he
would
not
mind
a
scrap
for
the
wakefulness
of
young
ferrers
and
david
was
morally
or
immorally
sure
that
bags
s
conscience
was
not
immaculate
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
disappearance
of
the
though
exactly
what
david
had
no
idea
then
he
gave
a
little
cackle
of
delight
for
he
saw
that
bags
had
stopped
in
his
indolent
stroll
with
the
then
that
he
turned
and
was
coming
back
towards
him
david
lay
down
at
full
length
and
whistled
in
an
absent
manner
without
looking
he
became
aware
that
bags
was
standing
close
to
him
i
say
blazes
i
want
to
tell
you
something
said
that
one
at
length
david
sat
up
with
an
air
of
great
surprise
hallo
that
you
he
said
tell
away
then
if
it
won
t
take
too
well
it
s
private
you
must
swear
not
to
tell
any
david
shook
his
head
oh
i
couldn
t
do
that
he
said
why
not
david
turned
on
him
an
indulgent
glance
oh
i
expect
you
know
he
said
it
s
partly
because
i
know
already
what
you
re
going
to
tell
me
and
partly
because
you
re
a
swindling
stealing
liar
and
the
sooner
other
chaps
know
that
the
bags
made
a
swinging
blow
in
the
air
with
his
well
then
i
don
t
care
he
said
i
ll
give
you
three
of
the
jolliest
cuts
you
ever
had
at
will
you
after
ferrers
minor
has
told
his
story
asked
david
well
i
tried
to
get
out
of
it
said
the
unhappy
bags
there
was
an
awful
bright
moon
last
night
crabtree
said
david
thoughtfully
but
about
what
you
want
to
tell
me
it
might
make
a
difference
if
you
told
me
bags
capitulated
well
then
i
took
your
beastly
and
put
them
back
on
your
bed
when
you
had
gone
to
your
oh
that
was
the
way
it
was
said
david
pretty
cute
but
then
you
see
i
was
cuter
ferrers
minor
didn
t
lie
awake
a
minute
as
far
as
i
know
but
i
saw
you
had
a
bad
conscience
can
t
think
why
you
didn
t
accept
my
challenge
straight
off
why
didn
t
you
he
looked
at
the
dejected
bags
and
his
funny
boyish
little
soul
suddenly
grew
perceptive
what
s
the
row
bags
he
asked
bags
sat
down
on
the
grass
by
him
i
feel
perfectly
beastly
he
said
you
re
always
horrid
to
me
i
like
you
so
awfully
you
kicked
me
fit
to
kill
last
night
just
because
i
threw
an
at
you
i
only
did
it
for
a
lark
just
because
i
felt
fit
and
after
i
had
taken
your
stags
i
was
sorry
and
i
tried
to
get
out
of
your
challenge
though
i
knew
you
would
lose
david
ceased
to
sit
in
the
seat
of
the
scornful
whatever
bags
had
done
and
he
really
had
done
a
good
deal
he
had
blurted
out
that
he
liked
him
so
it
was
no
time
to
inquire
whether
he
had
seen
glanders
and
not
warned
him
or
to
examine
further
into
the
bally
what
bags
had
said
in
all
sincerity
took
rank
over
anything
bags
might
have
done
and
with
that
he
wiped
the
whole
affair
clean
off
his
mind
and
held
out
a
rather
grubby
hand
i
bet
we
get
on
rippingly
after
this
he
said
hopefully
chapter
iv
david
was
swaggering
more
nor
the
new
school
blazer
and
on
the
morning
of
the
against
eagles
school
which
was
the
great
event
of
the
entire
year
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
swagger
was
but
a
hollow
show
and
though
he
was
completely
conscious
of
being
an
object
of
envy
and
admiration
in
the
eyes
of
the
small
boys
or
indeed
of
anybody
who
was
not
in
the
eleven
he
did
not
envy
himself
in
the
smallest
degree
to
begin
with
he
had
that
which
in
later
life
is
called
an
attack
of
nerves
though
at
present
it
came
under
the
general
comprehensive
head
of
feeling
beastly
which
made
his
mouth
dry
and
his
hands
damp
and
his
inside
empty
but
not
hungry
and
to
make
this
worse
his
father
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
down
to
see
the
match
that
might
not
sound
tragical
but
to
david
it
was
the
cause
of
awful
apprehensions
which
require
a
true
sympathy
with
the
sensibilities
attaching
to
the
age
of
thirteen
fully
to
appreciate
to
begin
with
his
father
was
an
archdeacon
and
since
he
wore
a
and
odd
black
wrinkled
gaiters
even
when
as
during
last
summer
holidays
he
climbed
the
hills
in
the
lake
district
with
a
small
edition
of
the
poems
of
wordsworth
in
his
pocket
from
which
he
read
aloud
at
frequent
david
had
not
allowed
himself
to
hope
that
on
the
present
inauspicious
occasion
he
would
be
dressed
like
any
other
person
and
so
escape
the
biting
criticisms
that
his
curious
garments
would
be
sure
to
call
forth
but
there
was
much
worse
than
this
for
his
father
was
going
to
stay
with
the
head
over
sunday
and
was
to
preach
in
school
chapel
in
the
evening
that
had
occurred
once
before
and
the
thought
of
the
repetition
of
it
made
david
feel
cold
all
over
for
his
father
among
many
other
infelicitous
remarks
in
the
course
of
an
infliction
which
had
lasted
over
half
an
hour
as
timed
by
the
indignant
holders
of
surreptitious
watches
had
alluded
to
the
chapel
and
the
services
there
as
the
central
happiness
of
david
had
barely
yet
lived
down
that
fatal
phrase
everything
connected
with
chapel
had
been
rechristened
the
chapel
bell
had
been
called
the
central
happiness
bell
it
was
time
for
central
happiness
one
was
late
for
central
the
school
had
been
addressed
as
lads
in
the
springtime
of
hope
and
promise
it
was
the
most
deplorable
affair
and
he
might
easily
in
this
coming
trial
give
birth
to
more
of
these
degrading
expressions
which
david
felt
to
be
a
personal
disgrace
but
it
was
not
even
his
father
s
dress
nor
his
possible
behaviour
in
the
pulpit
that
david
dreaded
most
it
was
the
fear
that
he
would
again
as
he
had
expressed
it
before
take
part
in
their
on
that
lamentable
occasion
he
had
had
dinner
with
the
boys
not
sitting
at
the
masters
table
which
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
side
by
side
with
david
at
the
table
of
the
sixth
form
as
had
it
there
was
provided
for
dinner
that
day
beefsteak
pudding
otherwise
known
as
since
it
was
firmly
though
mistakenly
believed
that
it
was
composed
of
all
the
scraps
left
on
the
plates
during
the
last
week
this
tradition
was
beyond
all
question
of
argument
and
conjecture
it
was
founded
on
solid
proof
since
ferrers
had
distinctly
recognised
one
day
in
his
portion
of
a
piece
of
meat
which
he
himself
had
intentionally
left
on
his
plate
four
days
previously
consequently
however
hungry
you
might
be
it
was
a
point
of
etiquette
never
to
eat
a
mouthful
of
and
david
s
misguided
parent
had
not
only
eaten
all
his
but
like
oliver
twist
had
asked
for
more
and
unlike
him
had
obtained
it
and
eaten
that
as
well
with
praise
and
unction
of
course
he
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
he
had
been
eating
scavenged
remains
so
much
justice
was
done
him
but
he
had
remarked
on
the
excellence
of
it
whereas
it
was
popularly
supposed
to
clearly
then
that
was
the
sort
of
food
which
blaize
was
regaled
on
at
home
in
the
holidays
and
witheringly
sarcastic
pictures
were
drawn
of
blaize
s
pater
in
gaiters
collecting
scraps
from
the
dustbin
in
his
and
gleefully
taking
them
to
the
kitchen
these
miserable
forebodings
well
founded
on
bitter
experience
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
team
from
eagles
school
and
the
home
team
took
the
visitors
off
to
the
dormitories
to
put
on
their
flannels
it
fell
to
david
s
lot
to
be
host
to
a
boy
called
ward
of
trying
deliberation
in
the
matter
of
dress
who
parted
his
hair
four
times
before
he
arrived
at
the
desired
result
and
looked
with
a
marked
abstention
from
comment
at
the
decorations
in
david
s
cubicle
consequently
when
they
got
down
to
the
field
again
the
rest
of
the
two
elevens
were
practising
at
the
nets
the
grass
was
dotted
over
with
groups
of
boys
whose
parents
had
misguidedly
determined
to
visit
their
sons
while
the
happier
class
unhampered
with
the
dangers
and
responsibilities
attaching
to
relations
were
comfortably
dispersed
on
rugs
in
the
shade
of
the
elms
david
cast
an
anxious
glance
round
to
see
if
his
own
responsibility
had
yet
arrived
when
his
eye
fell
on
the
figures
at
the
nets
and
the
appalling
truth
burst
upon
him
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistake
mingled
with
the
crowd
at
the
nets
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
was
a
figure
in
gaiters
and
a
just
taking
off
his
coat
and
added
brown
flannel
shirt
he
held
up
a
to
his
eye
a
moment
in
the
manner
of
fifty
years
ago
and
taking
a
short
stodgy
run
delivered
it
his
hat
fell
off
and
the
ball
was
so
wide
that
it
went
not
even
into
the
net
for
which
it
was
intended
but
into
the
next
adjoining
david
s
companion
saw
for
that
matter
david
felt
that
all
europe
saw
and
laughed
lightly
i
say
look
at
that
funny
old
buffer
in
a
flannel
shirt
he
said
he
bowled
into
the
wrong
net
i
wonder
why
he
wears
such
rummy
david
felt
his
heart
sink
into
the
toes
of
his
and
leak
out
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
his
father
was
perfectly
certain
to
kiss
him
when
he
joined
the
fellows
at
the
nets
and
the
truth
might
as
well
come
out
now
oh
that
s
my
pater
he
said
oh
is
it
said
ward
politely
with
a
faint
suppressed
smile
but
i
expect
he
s
awfully
clever
isn
t
he
my
guv
nor
played
cricket
for
england
one
year
and
made
just
then
david
was
beyond
the
reach
of
human
comfort
at
any
other
time
it
would
have
been
a
glorious
thing
to
be
walking
with
the
son
of
a
man
who
had
made
fifty
for
england
but
just
now
such
glory
was
in
total
eclipse
there
fifty
yards
away
was
his
own
father
putting
his
on
again
he
wore
gaiters
and
a
flannel
shirt
he
bowled
into
the
wrong
net
he
would
preach
and
perhaps
again
eat
twice
of
but
a
certain
innate
loyalty
made
him
stand
up
for
this
parody
of
a
parent
oh
my
father
doesn
t
know
a
thing
about
cricket
he
said
but
he
s
frightfully
clever
he
writes
books
about
could
not
remember
what
they
were
he
writes
books
that
are
supposed
to
be
jolly
good
he
took
a
at
oxford
the
archdeacon
had
seen
his
son
and
to
david
s
great
relief
did
not
bowl
any
more
but
came
towards
him
there
were
bad
moments
to
follow
for
he
kissed
him
in
sight
of
the
whole
school
at
which
ward
looked
delicately
away
also
he
had
turned
up
the
sleeves
of
his
brown
flannel
shirt
as
if
brown
flannel
was
not
bad
enough
and
revealed
the
fact
that
below
it
he
wore
a
jaeger
vest
how
hopelessly
impossible
that
was
words
fail
to
convey
nobody
ever
wore
vests
in
the
summer
you
had
your
coat
waistcoat
and
shirt
and
then
it
was
you
it
was
fuggy
to
wear
a
vest
in
the
summer
unless
you
had
a
cold
and
everybody
would
see
that
he
had
a
fuggy
father
and
oh
the
idiocy
of
his
attempting
to
bowl
it
was
pure
swank
to
try
it
for
at
home
he
never
joined
in
his
children
s
games
but
here
the
deplorable
habit
of
joining
in
the
life
of
the
place
asserted
itself
the
same
habit
made
him
when
at
the
seaside
talk
knowingly
to
bewildered
fishermen
before
whom
he
soon
exposed
his
ignorance
by
mistaking
a
mackerel
for
a
herring
or
when
in
switzerland
in
summer
holidays
to
walk
about
the
milder
slopes
of
the
alps
with
a
climber
s
rope
about
his
shoulders
and
a
piece
of
edelweiss
stuck
into
his
if
he
would
only
stick
to
the
things
at
which
he
was
frightfully
clever
and
not
go
careering
about
in
these
amateur
excursions
presently
the
field
was
cleared
for
the
match
the
home
side
won
the
toss
and
poor
david
who
was
going
in
fifth
wicket
endured
the
tortures
of
the
lost
his
father
sat
next
him
on
a
bench
in
front
of
the
pavilion
still
with
his
coat
off
and
continued
to
enter
into
the
life
of
the
place
by
pouring
forth
torrents
of
the
most
dreadful
conversation
there
were
crowds
of
boys
sitting
and
standing
close
round
them
every
one
could
hear
exactly
what
was
being
said
and
every
one
david
made
no
doubt
was
saving
it
up
for
exact
reproduction
afterwards
and
virgil
he
said
you
wrote
to
me
that
you
were
reading
the
story
of
dido
regina
we
must
attend
to
the
cricket
mustn
t
we
ha
there
s
a
fine
hit
well
played
sir
well
played
the
fine
hit
in
question
was
accomplished
by
stone
to
any
one
who
knew
the
rudiments
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
he
intended
to
drive
the
ball
but
mishitting
it
had
snicked
it
off
the
edge
of
his
bat
through
the
slips
where
it
should
have
been
caught
instead
of
which
it
went
to
the
boundary
four
a
fine
four
said
the
archdeacon
enthusiastically
ah
the
should
have
fielded
it
was
only
being
thrown
in
to
the
bowler
said
david
ah
but
if
the
had
fielded
it
he
might
have
stumped
the
batsman
said
his
father
knowingly
suddenly
and
pleasantly
recalling
fragments
of
long
since
forgotten
the
batsman
was
yards
out
of
popping
quite
without
warning
a
small
boy
standing
close
behind
where
they
sat
burst
into
a
bubble
of
irrepressible
giggling
and
walked
rapidly
away
cramming
his
handkerchief
into
his
mouth
otherwise
just
close
round
them
was
dead
silence
and
attention
and
david
looked
in
impotent
exasperation
at
the
rows
of
rapt
faces
and
slightly
quivering
mouths
knowing
that
this
priceless
conversation
was
being
carefully
stored
up
he
was
aware
that
his
father
was
being
gloriously
funny
that
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
s
father
who
was
enunciating
those
views
he
would
have
listened
with
internal
quiverings
or
like
stephens
would
have
found
himself
compelled
to
move
away
from
politeness
but
agitated
and
nervous
waiting
for
his
innings
he
could
see
nothing
funny
about
it
wearily
he
explained
that
you
could
not
be
stumped
off
a
hit
to
the
boundary
that
you
were
given
four
runs
without
running
for
them
but
his
father
thought
it
an
arguable
point
and
argued
two
wickets
fell
in
rapid
succession
after
this
and
david
began
putting
on
his
pads
aunt
eleanor
s
five
shillings
had
been
spent
in
a
glove
and
even
at
this
dark
and
anxious
moment
it
afforded
him
a
gleam
of
consolation
but
the
donning
of
these
protective
articles
awoke
further
criticism
why
are
you
putting
all
those
things
on
my
boy
asked
the
archdeacon
you
shouldn
t
be
afraid
of
a
knock
or
two
why
we
never
thought
anything
of
a
shooter
on
the
shins
when
i
was
a
lad
and
gloves
surely
you
can
t
bat
in
firm
fixed
smiles
illuminated
the
faces
of
those
round
david
had
rubbed
the
second
glove
in
so
to
speak
rather
profusely
during
this
last
week
the
school
generally
had
heard
a
little
too
much
about
it
but
david
was
hearing
a
little
too
much
about
it
now
and
a
shooter
on
the
shins
how
could
a
shooter
hit
your
shins
blazes
pater
was
talking
through
his
hat
that
very
odd
hat
oh
every
one
wears
pads
and
gloves
if
they
ve
got
them
said
david
rather
viciously
well
well
i
suppose
we
were
rather
too
spartan
for
these
days
said
his
father
ah
well
blocked
well
blocked
things
were
going
badly
for
the
four
wickets
had
fallen
for
thirty
and
david
was
feeling
colder
and
clammier
every
moment
this
was
far
the
most
important
match
of
the
year
and
he
knew
quite
well
that
it
largely
lay
on
him
to
stem
the
tide
of
disaster
he
knew
too
even
more
keenly
that
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
one
of
the
bowlers
in
the
very
least
the
wicket
was
fiery
and
he
was
bumping
in
the
most
manner
he
himself
was
primarily
a
bowler
but
owing
to
the
runs
he
had
made
last
week
was
put
in
fifth
wicket
instead
of
being
reserved
for
the
tail
when
the
sting
being
taken
out
of
the
bowling
he
would
have
been
quite
likely
to
make
runs
but
this
morning
the
sting
had
not
at
all
been
taken
out
of
the
bowling
it
was
still
detestably
steady
and
he
saw
in
the
agonised
period
of
waiting
for
the
next
wicket
to
fall
that
he
ought
to
play
a
careful
game
and
wait
for
opportunities
of
scoring
instead
of
running
any
risks
on
the
other
hand
with
his
nerves
in
this
condition
he
felt
that
nothing
could
give
him
confidence
except
one
or
two
proper
slogs
with
them
duly
accomplished
he
thought
he
could
wipe
off
the
paralysing
effect
of
his
father
s
presence
and
conversation
then
came
a
shout
of
how
s
that
from
the
field
and
stone
was
out
caught
at
the
wicket
there
were
three
more
balls
in
that
over
to
be
delivered
not
by
the
bumping
terror
but
by
a
slow
bowler
and
as
david
walked
out
to
the
pitch
he
abandoned
prudence
and
determined
to
hit
out
if
possible
at
once
and
so
get
the
confidence
he
needed
he
looked
carefully
round
the
field
and
stood
to
receive
his
first
ball
if
he
had
been
able
to
choose
he
would
have
selected
no
other
ball
than
that
it
was
a
clear
of
his
the
very
ball
to
smite
at
he
did
so
and
in
the
very
moment
of
hitting
he
heard
that
he
had
mistimed
it
somehow
or
other
he
got
right
underneath
it
and
it
soared
and
soared
almost
straight
up
in
the
air
as
he
ran
he
knew
the
feverish
clapping
of
one
pair
of
hands
and
his
father
s
voice
shouting
well
hit
well
hit
then
the
ball
was
easily
caught
by
and
david
was
sure
that
never
till
the
end
of
his
life
would
he
be
able
to
get
over
what
had
happened
he
was
out
first
ball
off
a
simple
in
the
match
of
the
year
everybody
from
jessop
downwards
would
know
and
would
despise
him
and
it
was
the
boy
whose
father
had
made
fifty
for
england
who
had
caught
him
it
is
falsely
said
that
the
serious
troubles
of
life
only
begin
when
manhood
is
reached
there
was
never
anything
so
grotesquely
untrue
when
manhood
is
reached
on
the
contrary
the
apparently
irremediable
nature
of
most
events
almost
ceases
the
man
though
bitterly
disappointed
in
one
direction
has
the
power
of
seeing
that
there
are
other
directions
he
knows
also
that
though
he
is
acutely
unhappy
at
the
moment
his
misery
will
be
alleviated
not
only
by
his
own
efforts
but
by
the
mere
passage
of
time
but
to
any
boy
whose
keenness
and
enthusiasm
promises
well
for
the
future
no
such
alleviation
is
possible
he
has
no
knowledge
of
the
healing
power
of
time
in
these
crucial
years
no
realisation
that
other
opportunities
will
come
his
misery
like
his
happiness
is
exclusive
of
all
other
considerations
the
moment
to
david
was
completely
horrible
he
was
out
on
this
monumental
occasion
without
scoring
while
his
hopeless
father
though
with
no
sarcastic
intention
had
shouted
well
hit
and
there
was
this
added
sting
in
that
simple
phrase
that
now
every
boy
in
the
school
would
know
what
his
christian
name
was
for
christian
names
at
helmsworth
were
hidden
secrets
if
you
liked
a
boy
very
much
you
might
tell
him
what
your
christian
name
was
but
to
have
it
publicly
shouted
out
so
that
every
one
knew
was
quite
horrible
and
as
he
walked
back
to
the
pavilion
the
world
contained
no
more
for
him
than
that
he
was
out
first
ball
and
that
his
name
was
david
all
sorts
of
stories
from
the
book
of
kings
which
most
unfortunately
was
being
read
just
now
at
morning
chapel
would
be
treasured
up
against
him
they
would
ask
after
jesse
and
as
likely
as
not
his
would
be
known
as
bathsheba
and
uriah
the
innings
of
the
proceeded
disastrously
the
whole
team
was
out
before
lunch
for
and
eagles
made
twenty
before
the
interval
without
loss
of
a
wicket
david
at
present
had
not
been
put
on
to
bowl
and
was
fielding
deep
near
where
the
archdeacon
was
sitting
talking
to
goggles
and
carrots
who
were
apparently
instructing
him
about
the
disposition
of
the
field
while
the
archdeacon
in
his
manly
way
deplored
the
fact
that
the
wore
gloves
and
pads
also
he
thought
that
boundaries
were
an
effeminate
institution
in
his
day
everything
had
to
be
run
out
and
a
jolly
lot
of
running
you
had
to
do
thought
david
but
with
optimistic
hospitality
helmsworth
hoped
that
lunch
would
worry
the
batsmen
though
helmsworth
howling
apparently
did
not
and
were
assiduous
in
filling
their
visitors
plates
and
glasses
david
s
acquaintance
of
the
morning
who
had
made
fifteen
out
of
the
twenty
runs
already
scored
proved
himself
as
distinguished
at
table
as
he
was
at
the
wickets
and
ate
in
perfectly
incredible
quantities
during
the
last
fortnight
friendship
had
prospered
as
david
had
thought
probable
between
bags
and
himself
and
bags
who
did
not
so
to
speak
know
a
bat
from
a
ball
and
so
was
not
called
upon
to
defend
the
honour
of
helmsworth
had
a
wise
thought
that
day
he
had
been
of
the
group
that
had
listened
retentively
to
the
archdeacon
s
preposterous
conversation
and
had
seen
david
s
inglorious
and
fruitless
innings
then
came
the
wise
thought
it
must
be
jolly
difficult
to
play
cricket
if
your
pater
is
making
an
ass
of
himself
and
directly
after
lunch
bags
proceeded
to
tempt
the
pater
away
from
the
field
he
got
hold
of
the
key
of
chapel
listened
with
sycophantic
interest
to
legends
about
the
saints
in
the
windows
and
managed
to
inveigle
him
into
a
long
stroll
round
the
grounds
there
was
something
heroic
about
this
for
though
bags
could
not
play
cricket
he
wanted
to
watch
it
and
in
especial
to
watch
david
for
when
he
was
nice
he
was
in
bags
s
unspoken
phrase
such
an
awfully
fetching
he
had
all
that
one
boy
admires
in
another
he
was
quick
and
ready
of
laughter
he
was
in
the
eleven
which
was
an
attraction
he
was
very
which
was
another
and
in
point
of
fact
at
that
portentous
moment
when
it
was
made
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
blaize
s
christian
name
was
david
bags
would
have
rather
liked
it
if
some
one
had
proclaimed
that
his
own
name
was
jonathan
but
as
it
was
only
george
it
might
as
well
remain
a
secret
now
david
was
a
bowler
of
the
type
known
as
in
other
words
he
bowled
balls
apparently
so
slow
and
stupid
and
devoid
of
all
merit
that
a
batsman
who
did
not
know
quite
all
about
them
felt
insulted
and
tried
to
do
impossible
things
with
them
so
the
score
having
risen
to
thirty
without
the
loss
of
a
wicket
stone
said
try
an
over
this
end
david
had
seen
the
departure
of
his
father
with
bags
from
the
field
and
felt
enormously
better
another
opportunity
in
a
new
direction
had
come
and
as
he
took
up
the
ball
his
fingers
tingled
with
possibilities
he
had
a
few
sauntering
up
to
the
crease
and
pitching
them
slow
and
high
without
any
spin
then
epical
matters
began
he
took
an
enormous
prancing
run
at
top
speed
and
delivered
a
ball
of
surpassing
slowness
ward
who
received
it
suspected
there
was
something
funny
about
it
which
there
wasn
t
and
as
it
was
clearly
off
the
wicket
he
left
it
alone
the
next
one
was
a
slow
straight
which
he
very
properly
hit
for
four
so
also
was
the
next
with
which
he
did
likewise
then
came
the
wile
david
s
fourth
ball
for
which
he
did
not
take
nearly
so
long
a
run
was
considerably
faster
than
the
other
two
ward
completely
mistimed
it
and
was
bowled
off
the
last
ball
of
his
over
a
really
fast
one
he
caught
and
bowled
the
incomer
this
was
better
though
still
bad
two
wickets
were
down
for
whereas
none
had
been
down
for
thirty
then
ensued
an
hour
of
excitement
at
the
end
of
which
nine
wickets
were
down
for
seventy
of
which
david
had
taken
seven
as
it
was
a
s
match
it
was
to
be
decided
on
the
first
innings
if
there
was
not
time
for
two
and
at
that
moment
david
was
probably
the
most
popular
person
in
surrey
it
was
his
over
again
his
first
two
balls
each
narrowly
missed
the
wicket
the
third
was
gently
spooned
into
his
hands
and
he
promptly
dropped
it
the
fourth
was
hit
for
four
and
eagles
had
won
by
one
wicket
with
his
next
ball
david
captured
the
remaining
wicket
but
he
had
already
lost
the
match
for
them
by
dropping
the
easiest
catch
ever
seen
two
exultant
batsmen
and
eleven
miserable
fielders
went
towards
the
pavilion
stone
with
spurious
consolation
slipped
his
arm
into
david
s
as
they
walked
by
jove
well
bowled
blazes
he
said
you
took
eight
wickets
for
about
thirty
jolly
good
for
your
oh
blast
my
average
said
david
as
if
i
didn
t
know
i
lost
the
david
s
comment
was
more
in
tune
with
the
popular
verdict
than
stone
s
it
was
quite
certain
that
helmsworth
would
have
won
had
not
that
ass
blazes
david
blazes
dropped
the
pottiest
catch
ever
seen
exactly
as
in
the
world
afterwards
his
achievement
in
having
so
nearly
won
the
match
for
them
by
his
bowling
was
entirely
wiped
out
by
his
subsequent
mistake
criticism
in
fact
had
nothing
to
argue
about
it
was
all
so
clear
and
as
tea
was
in
progress
in
the
tent
bags
and
the
archdeacon
in
a
state
of
high
animation
appeared
on
the
lurid
scene
they
were
instructed
as
to
the
result
somebody
caught
you
you
couldn
t
catch
him
said
david
s
father
playfully
yes
just
that
said
david
wanting
the
earth
to
open
he
could
have
caught
that
ball
with
his
eyes
shut
the
archdeacon
found
himself
next
goggles
who
had
told
him
that
morning
the
difference
between
point
and
i
have
been
seeing
the
he
said
my
young
friend
crabtree
tells
me
you
will
play
a
noble
instrument
and
now
we
have
returned
to
see
some
more
cricket
i
am
afraid
the
blaize
family
have
not
helped
you
much
but
we
will
try
again
david
is
in
the
choir
is
he
not
one
of
us
in
the
choir
the
other
in
the
pulpit
tea
thank
you
a
cup
of
tea
after
the
excitement
of
the
match
would
not
be
david
felt
as
if
he
was
being
publicly
insulted
though
all
that
was
really
at
fault
was
his
father
s
friendly
adaptability
he
had
been
markedly
interested
in
cricket
when
cricket
was
predominant
but
the
excitement
of
that
being
over
he
transferred
his
mind
to
the
next
engrossing
topic
which
was
sunday
when
the
blaize
family
would
make
another
effort
but
he
erred
in
not
adapting
himself
to
the
age
and
outlook
of
those
with
whom
he
strove
to
identify
himself
and
in
thinking
that
it
was
possible
for
a
boy
in
the
school
eleven
who
had
nearly
won
and
then
quite
lost
the
match
for
his
side
to
treat
a
tragedy
like
that
lightly
or
feel
the
smallest
interest
in
pulpits
or
choirs
an
hour
of
cricket
succeeded
tea
but
since
it
was
impossible
to
arrive
at
a
finished
second
innings
this
was
but
a
tepid
performance
and
after
the
eagles
eleven
had
been
speeded
with
cheers
in
which
david
s
father
joined
with
wavings
of
his
curious
hat
he
turned
to
more
serious
concerns
again
and
took
david
off
for
a
stroll
in
the
grounds
to
have
a
paternal
talk
to
him
there
was
comedy
in
some
of
these
proceedings
for
when
they
had
put
a
hundred
yards
or
so
between
them
and
the
the
archdeacon
took
out
a
i
should
not
like
to
be
seen
smoking
he
said
by
any
of
your
companions
but
i
think
we
are
unobserved
david
nearly
laughed
but
managed
not
to
as
luck
would
have
it
his
father
had
stopped
on
the
very
spot
which
was
sacred
to
the
meetings
of
the
smoking
club
the
head
smokes
he
said
encouragingly
he
saw
too
that
his
father
s
brand
of
cigarettes
was
that
preferred
by
the
smoking
club
then
ensued
the
serious
talk
cricket
was
commended
in
moderation
but
as
an
amusement
only
not
as
an
end
in
itself
david
s
was
gone
into
and
he
gave
again
the
information
he
had
put
into
his
sunday
letter
a
few
weeks
ago
then
it
appeared
his
father
had
heard
a
boy
swear
as
he
watched
the
and
hoped
that
such
a
thing
was
a
rare
if
not
a
unique
occurrence
and
david
with
the
barrier
of
age
rising
swiftly
and
impregnably
between
them
hoped
so
too
transitionally
noticing
the
blue
of
the
july
sky
the
true
meaning
of
the
latin
word
was
debated
and
david
cordially
agreed
that
it
probably
meant
grey
and
not
blue
then
his
prayers
were
touched
on
which
as
a
rule
were
not
very
fervent
performances
this
morning
however
he
had
said
one
prayer
with
extreme
earnestness
to
the
effect
that
helmsworth
should
win
the
which
they
had
just
lost
and
david
after
the
views
that
had
been
expressed
on
the
subject
of
cricket
felt
it
better
not
to
give
details
on
this
subject
take
it
altogether
the
talk
was
hardly
a
success
david
s
father
feeling
that
the
boy
was
not
being
open
with
him
which
was
perfectly
true
and
david
feeling
that
his
father
didn
t
understand
anything
at
all
about
him
this
happened
to
be
true
also
at
any
rate
his
father
had
no
conception
of
what
it
felt
like
to
be
thirteen
any
more
than
david
had
any
conception
of
what
it
felt
like
to
be
then
came
the
one
bright
spot
the
head
is
very
well
satisfied
with
you
said
his
father
as
they
turned
instantly
david
s
eye
brightened
oh
is
he
really
he
asked
how
awfully
ripping
even
he
stopped
knowing
that
his
father
would
not
understand
even
after
what
said
he
david
blushed
oh
it
was
nothing
he
said
i
only
was
going
to
say
after
missing
that
catch
i
suppose
he
would
think
that
didn
t
matter
though
of
course
he
s
awfully
keen
for
the
school
to
win
the
eagles
he
left
his
father
at
the
head
s
house
and
walked
back
across
the
field
to
the
museum
where
he
was
already
late
for
preparation
as
the
bell
had
sounded
ten
minutes
before
he
knew
quite
well
that
his
father
was
fond
of
him
and
was
anxious
about
his
but
somehow
the
serious
talks
froze
him
up
and
he
could
not
feel
all
the
things
he
knew
he
was
expected
to
feel
it
was
so
odd
not
knowing
that
fellows
swore
when
they
jammed
their
fingers
in
doors
or
were
suddenly
annoyed
at
anything
probably
people
did
not
but
that
was
because
they
were
he
was
afraid
it
was
a
distinct
relief
that
the
jaw
was
over
and
on
the
top
of
that
in
a
way
that
he
did
not
understand
he
was
sorry
he
was
glad
and
then
suddenly
he
swept
all
those
puzzling
regrets
off
his
mind
and
he
became
alertly
and
absolutely
thirteen
again
walking
across
the
field
towards
him
came
dutton
who
on
his
approach
as
david
s
extremely
observant
eye
noted
put
something
in
his
in
an
interesting
and
furtive
manner
without
doubt
he
had
been
smoking
his
pipe
as
he
came
from
a
thing
which
all
the
school
knew
was
forbidden
to
masters
in
the
school
precincts
for
fear
of
the
bad
example
to
the
boys
this
was
interesting
it
might
lead
to
something
and
david
knowing
that
the
fact
that
he
had
been
walking
with
his
father
neutralised
all
possible
penalties
for
being
late
for
advanced
timidly
as
if
he
thought
he
was
detected
in
some
breach
of
rules
dutton
had
just
come
out
of
with
the
other
masters
and
was
feeling
autocratic
he
called
david
in
a
peremptory
and
abrupt
manner
come
here
blaize
he
said
now
dutton
was
not
at
all
a
nice
young
man
and
his
unpopularity
in
the
school
was
perfectly
justified
he
had
favourites
usually
pink
pretty
little
boys
whose
misdoings
he
treated
with
leniency
while
those
who
were
not
distinguished
with
his
regard
he
visited
with
the
hundred
petty
tyrannies
which
his
mastership
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
exercising
he
also
had
an
effective
trick
of
sarcastic
speech
which
is
an
unfair
weapon
to
employ
to
those
who
are
not
in
a
position
to
answer
back
and
of
all
those
under
his
charge
there
was
none
whom
he
so
cordially
disliked
as
david
who
returned
the
aversion
with
uncommon
heartiness
dutton
was
often
not
quite
sure
whether
david
under
a
polite
demeanour
was
not
cheeking
him
though
he
need
not
have
had
any
doubt
whatever
on
the
matter
and
he
was
also
aware
that
all
the
impositions
which
he
set
the
boy
did
not
make
him
in
the
least
an
object
of
reverence
however
in
a
small
way
he
could
make
himself
burdensome
it
s
after
blaize
he
said
what
are
you
doing
out
only
walking
about
sir
said
david
did
you
know
it
was
after
david
looked
guilty
and
shifted
from
one
foot
to
another
sir
he
said
then
you
will
write
out
two
hundred
lines
of
the
fourth
√¶neid
and
bring
them
to
me
on
monday
evening
i
suppose
you
thought
that
your
heroic
performance
that
splendid
innings
of
yours
which
came
to
an
end
a
little
prematurely
perhaps
and
the
wonderful
catch
you
so
nearly
held
entitled
you
to
place
yourself
above
this
was
excellent
duttonese
cutting
and
insulting
and
impossible
to
answer
without
risk
of
further
penalties
for
insolence
for
the
moment
david
s
face
went
crimson
with
anger
and
dutton
rejoiced
in
his
mean
heart
and
proceeded
to
pile
up
irony
he
had
forgotten
the
pipe
in
his
pocket
the
smoke
of
which
curled
thinly
up
but
david
had
not
forgotten
it
nor
did
he
fail
to
see
that
the
head
was
coming
up
across
the
field
towards
them
with
his
swift
rocking
motion
and
a
vengeance
of
a
singularly
pleasant
kind
suggested
itself
to
him
had
not
dubs
made
himself
so
gratuitously
offensive
he
would
not
have
dreamed
of
taking
it
if
he
had
even
only
stopped
there
he
might
not
have
done
so
but
the
disgusting
dubs
intoxicated
with
his
own
eloquence
and
rejoicing
to
see
david
writhing
under
it
did
not
stop
it
was
a
grand
day
for
you
was
it
not
proceeded
this
odious
man
with
your
father
to
look
on
and
call
out
well
played
blaize
beg
your
pardon
well
played
and
to
finish
with
being
late
for
is
a
fine
the
head
was
close
to
them
now
coming
up
silently
on
the
grass
behind
dutton
at
a
few
yards
distance
he
joined
in
the
colloquy
what
is
all
this
what
is
all
this
he
inquired
dutton
turned
blaize
is
late
for
he
said
i
have
just
set
him
two
hundred
well
blaize
said
the
head
david
shook
off
the
guilty
slouch
and
stood
erect
and
confident
please
sir
i
was
walking
with
my
father
he
said
mr
dutton
didn
t
ask
me
to
explain
as
he
went
on
about
my
being
out
first
ball
and
missing
that
you
have
only
just
left
your
father
asked
the
head
yes
sir
two
minutes
the
head
nodded
we
will
remit
that
imposition
he
observed
then
david
suddenly
stared
at
that
which
he
had
been
secretly
glancing
at
namely
the
whorl
of
smoke
from
dutton
s
pocket
please
sir
you
re
burning
he
said
anxiously
pointing
at
it
something
is
burning
in
your
the
head
transferred
his
awful
eye
to
dutton
and
sniffed
with
his
omniscient
nose
you
may
go
blaize
he
said
well
dutton
david
scuttled
off
scored
off
you
cad
he
said
to
himself
still
hot
with
indignation
at
these
insults
but
as
david
had
expected
there
were
far
worse
things
to
be
faced
than
the
sarcasms
of
dutton
since
the
conclusion
of
the
match
david
s
performances
heavily
handicapped
by
those
of
his
father
had
been
subjected
to
serious
debate
and
had
been
found
to
be
wholly
unsatisfactory
it
was
true
that
he
had
captured
a
quantity
of
eagles
wickets
at
small
cost
but
with
the
match
in
his
hands
literally
in
his
hands
he
had
let
it
go
taking
his
record
as
a
whole
therefore
his
futile
innings
being
also
brought
under
scrutiny
it
was
fair
to
make
unkind
allusions
to
his
father
there
were
dissentients
from
the
general
view
the
chief
of
whom
was
bags
who
said
hotly
that
it
was
a
chouse
to
rag
blazes
considering
that
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
eagles
would
probably
have
won
by
eight
wickets
instead
of
one
for
who
stood
the
slightest
chance
of
getting
out
the
fellow
whose
father
had
made
fifty
for
england
even
weighted
as
he
was
with
salad
of
many
lobsters
but
this
view
was
that
of
a
small
minority
and
an
untrustworthy
sort
of
hush
settled
down
on
the
as
david
entered
with
simulated
composure
no
master
was
in
charge
during
this
hour
of
preparation
on
saturday
evening
and
though
every
boy
had
to
sit
at
his
desk
talking
was
allowed
sometimes
a
sort
of
visited
them
and
occasionally
for
a
pleasant
surprise
the
head
came
round
the
knowledge
of
which
possibility
checked
any
exuberance
but
provided
that
no
row
was
made
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
so
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
when
david
entered
the
sarcastic
intention
of
which
was
not
lost
on
him
for
there
was
no
mistaking
the
chilliness
of
his
reception
bags
it
is
true
greeted
him
with
a
hullo
blazes
but
otherwise
nothing
was
said
then
trouble
gently
began
to
accumulate
like
the
quiet
piling
up
of
with
old
testament
allusions
i
say
jesse
must
have
been
a
fine
old
chap
said
somebody
he
had
such
lots
of
oh
did
he
asked
somebody
else
politely
how
many
bout
ten
but
the
elder
ones
didn
t
seem
to
matter
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
david
gathered
himself
up
within
himself
then
conversation
began
again
with
rustling
of
the
leaves
of
bibles
to
refresh
memories
i
suppose
jesse
was
a
oh
rather
that
s
why
bags
is
so
keen
about
his
kids
i
say
it
s
sausages
isn
t
it
yes
bags
and
jesse
and
the
kids
won
t
have
any
breakfast
bad
david
looked
up
and
caught
bags
s
mild
eye
which
was
gleaming
with
sympathetic
martyrdom
then
the
attack
became
more
direct
i
say
mean
hope
you
had
a
good
david
had
got
a
certain
in
his
eye
which
bags
altogether
lacked
he
replied
briskly
yes
thanks
he
said
but
why
oh
i
didn
t
know
as
there
are
sausages
for
and
a
subdued
giggle
went
round
david
opened
the
lid
of
his
desk
i
say
mullins
he
remarked
to
the
last
speaker
if
you
don
t
know
you
d
better
find
out
i
ll
ask
you
about
it
when
we
go
up
to
right
oh
said
mullins
strong
in
the
consciousness
of
numbers
to
back
him
but
lots
of
chaps
will
tell
then
i
ll
ask
them
all
said
david
two
at
a
time
if
they
his
heart
quaked
but
the
essence
of
courage
is
not
that
your
heart
should
not
quake
but
that
nobody
else
should
know
that
it
does
jesse
had
younger
sons
as
well
said
somebody
else
while
mullins
was
thinking
about
this
there
was
one
who
was
ruddy
i
should
think
it
was
beastly
to
be
oh
yes
he
was
an
awful
corker
and
kept
sheep
don
t
suppose
he
could
keep
wickets
or
anything
like
that
probably
he
couldn
t
hold
the
simplest
catch
either
but
i
expect
he
could
spoon
them
up
himself
all
right
old
jesse
would
like
that
he
would
probably
say
well
i
say
was
the
name
of
the
kid
asked
a
voice
in
tones
of
the
intensest
interest
david
had
been
rummaging
in
his
desk
in
a
meaningless
manner
not
in
order
to
find
anything
but
to
have
something
to
do
to
cover
his
but
when
this
direct
question
was
asked
his
hand
closed
firmly
on
a
tight
solid
classical
dictionary
and
he
waited
for
the
answer
i
think
he
was
called
david
said
mullins
who
had
plucked
up
again
after
david
s
threat
which
had
silenced
him
for
the
time
yes
david
i
think
he
repeated
oh
do
you
said
david
and
before
mullins
had
time
to
guard
the
classical
dictionary
discharged
with
low
trajectory
hit
him
violently
on
the
nose
which
proceeded
to
bleed
and
if
anybody
else
wants
to
talk
about
david
that
s
what
he
ll
get
chuck
it
up
here
bags
gave
a
shriek
of
exultation
as
he
returned
the
dictionary
jolly
good
shot
he
said
bang
on
the
though
david
had
followed
that
excellent
maxim
of
war
if
in
an
inferior
position
attack
he
probably
would
have
thought
twice
had
he
not
completely
lost
his
temper
before
attacking
for
almost
everybody
but
bags
seemed
to
have
coalesced
against
him
and
he
was
taking
on
rather
a
large
order
but
the
very
suddenness
and
savageness
of
the
attack
certainly
surprised
the
hosts
of
the
enemy
for
a
moment
and
the
mullins
retired
to
comfort
his
nose
amid
dead
silence
but
david
s
cause
was
an
unpopular
one
and
he
knew
it
the
eagles
match
was
won
except
for
him
and
no
one
was
enough
to
reflect
that
it
would
have
been
much
more
decisively
lost
without
him
under
the
circumstances
though
he
had
silenced
mullins
altogether
for
mullins
certainly
would
not
want
to
be
hurt
again
and
david
in
his
present
mood
did
not
care
two
straws
whether
he
himself
was
hurt
or
not
he
knew
that
he
must
expect
a
disagreeable
evening
david
would
have
supplied
that
night
an
excellent
concrete
example
to
any
philosopher
who
wished
to
study
the
unstable
nature
of
popularity
during
that
exquisite
hour
when
he
was
tying
up
and
confusing
the
eagles
side
with
his
wily
bowling
there
was
no
bounds
to
his
popularity
and
in
one
moment
by
the
insufficient
closing
of
his
hand
he
had
forfeited
it
all
bags
alone
was
faithful
and
though
that
shot
with
the
classical
dictionary
had
silenced
one
of
his
tormentors
it
had
been
a
great
mistake
for
any
one
who
had
lost
the
match
so
palpably
as
he
had
done
must
expect
to
have
sarcastic
remarks
made
and
if
david
had
only
taken
them
with
the
meekness
that
their
justice
demanded
there
would
probably
soon
have
been
a
truce
to
his
punishment
but
meekness
unfortunately
was
one
of
those
christian
qualities
which
he
was
totally
devoid
of
and
though
his
summary
answer
to
mullins
had
been
successful
enough
he
found
that
even
if
it
had
been
possible
to
continue
making
violent
assaults
on
everybody
he
had
not
the
heart
to
do
so
so
chilly
and
dispiriting
was
the
general
attitude
towards
him
stone
for
instance
though
he
had
congratulated
david
on
his
bowling
directly
after
the
match
was
swayed
by
popular
feeling
and
when
on
going
up
to
dormitory
david
offered
him
one
of
his
supper
biscuits
which
was
highly
sought
after
stone
said
no
thanks
in
a
tone
that
would
have
chilled
a
salamander
no
one
definitely
cut
him
and
there
were
no
more
direct
allusions
to
the
son
of
jesse
for
the
portent
of
mullins
s
nose
was
a
which
it
would
have
been
folly
to
disregard
but
if
he
spoke
he
was
answered
in
polite
monosyllables
and
if
he
joined
a
chattering
group
the
chatter
ceased
until
he
went
away
again
no
one
but
bags
came
to
sit
on
his
bed
and
though
he
made
pretence
of
being
particularly
communicative
and
cheerful
he
jested
with
a
hollow
heart
next
morning
was
sunday
and
in
lieu
of
early
school
the
boys
were
allowed
to
spend
the
hour
before
breakfast
at
the
but
when
david
asked
stone
to
come
and
bathe
with
him
stone
replied
that
he
was
engaged
to
mullins
and
it
was
bitter
to
see
ferrers
lend
mullins
his
towel
though
after
he
had
finished
with
it
himself
and
find
that
mullins
fat
stupid
mullins
was
regarded
not
only
as
an
injured
person
which
anybody
could
see
who
looked
at
his
face
but
an
unjustly
injured
person
and
in
the
middle
of
david
s
bathe
who
should
appear
but
the
archdeacon
himself
it
is
true
that
he
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
which
was
known
as
the
masters
where
the
head
himself
sometimes
swam
fiercely
about
but
the
stout
apparition
of
his
father
clad
in
a
striped
jersey
cut
off
at
the
knees
and
shoulders
standing
on
the
was
a
distracting
affair
even
the
loyal
bags
who
had
followed
david
down
to
keep
him
company
for
bags
was
not
allowed
to
bathe
having
a
weak
heart
even
bags
gazed
in
dismay
at
that
squat
square
form
and
said
lor
simultaneously
somebody
behind
david
remarked
anyhow
he
takes
his
gaiters
david
felt
too
desolate
to
resent
this
also
he
was
watching
his
father
almost
praying
that
he
should
take
a
neat
header
but
a
loud
flat
smack
was
heard
as
he
fell
into
the
water
and
ferrers
said
to
mullins
i
say
can
your
pater
take
then
mullins
with
a
watchful
eye
on
david
as
he
dried
himself
with
ferrers
s
towel
began
to
whistle
once
in
royal
david
s
other
boys
began
to
whistle
it
too
it
was
all
deplorable
the
day
had
begun
badly
and
continued
badly
david
offered
to
share
his
with
the
boy
who
sat
next
him
in
chapel
who
appeared
not
to
see
what
he
did
he
asked
stone
to
come
for
a
walk
with
him
after
chapel
and
again
stone
was
engaged
to
mullins
but
all
the
time
bags
was
waiting
like
a
dog
to
divert
and
console
his
master
if
only
his
master
would
allow
him
eagerly
braving
the
unpleasantness
of
alliance
with
the
unpopular
side
and
though
hours
ago
david
would
have
scouted
the
idea
of
bags
consoling
him
he
turned
to
him
eagerly
now
and
even
allowed
him
to
have
the
monarch
s
in
his
pocket
at
dinner
and
though
all
the
slights
and
sneers
which
surrounded
them
were
of
the
general
nature
of
chaff
they
were
of
the
species
of
chaff
which
is
meant
to
hurt
as
bags
had
once
acutely
remarked
you
can
hit
a
fellow
over
the
head
just
to
show
you
like
him
but
you
can
do
the
very
same
thing
in
an
opposite
spirit
and
it
was
this
spirit
just
now
that
animated
these
small
boys
it
was
a
rag
no
doubt
but
a
rag
with
a
sting
in
it
for
david
was
paying
the
penalty
of
having
been
popular
as
well
as
of
having
disappointed
his
admirers
but
an
eye
wholly
unsuspected
was
watching
the
situation
the
head
was
perfectly
aware
that
david
had
lost
the
match
against
eagles
though
he
had
so
nearly
won
it
he
was
aware
also
what
manner
of
impression
david
s
father
would
make
on
his
irreverent
school
and
when
all
day
he
saw
david
no
longer
the
centre
of
groups
that
were
making
rather
more
noise
than
was
necessary
but
either
alone
or
with
bags
he
took
counsel
with
himself
and
stroked
his
grey
beard
for
several
minutes
then
he
went
across
to
the
museum
where
the
first
form
were
sitting
under
dutton
about
the
time
that
the
catechism
would
be
finished
and
the
third
missionary
journey
embarked
on
there
having
excused
dutton
he
suddenly
addressed
david
blaize
he
said
though
it
is
sunday
and
we
are
in
school
i
must
just
congratulate
you
on
your
bowling
performance
yesterday
i
have
watched
a
good
deal
of
cricket
at
helmsworth
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
it
was
by
far
the
finest
piece
of
bowling
i
can
remember
the
school
ought
to
be
proud
of
you
now
for
our
work
antioch
stone
where
is
antioch
there
was
no
getting
round
this
stone
ferrers
david
and
bags
walked
to
chapel
together
and
mullins
s
nose
suddenly
became
the
subject
of
unkind
and
universal
comment
chapter
v
david
returned
from
the
station
on
monday
morning
where
he
had
been
permitted
to
go
in
order
to
see
his
father
off
in
extremely
good
spirits
with
his
straw
hat
trimmed
with
the
school
eleven
colours
well
back
on
his
head
his
hands
in
his
pockets
where
one
caressed
five
distinct
shillings
the
other
the
of
the
monarch
while
fragments
of
cheerful
tunes
came
piercingly
forth
from
the
aperture
caused
by
his
broken
tooth
the
shape
of
this
orifice
no
doubt
had
something
to
do
with
the
deafening
quality
of
his
whistle
which
went
through
the
head
of
the
hearer
like
the
chirping
of
a
canary
in
a
circumscribed
room
and
when
deeds
of
infamy
such
as
illicit
feasts
were
going
on
in
the
bushes
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
he
was
often
suitably
bribed
to
keep
watch
at
the
railings
nearest
the
school
buildings
for
his
whistle
carried
that
distance
quite
easily
there
was
therefore
when
his
melodies
were
heard
time
to
remove
all
traces
of
debauch
before
dubs
or
any
other
incarnation
of
danger
could
arrive
so
desirable
indeed
was
the
gift
of
a
really
resonant
whistle
that
ferrers
had
at
one
time
begun
operations
on
one
of
his
own
front
teeth
with
the
file
on
his
in
order
to
get
a
similar
configuration
but
increasing
tenderness
had
made
him
desist
before
he
had
got
far
david
was
conscious
of
a
great
many
things
that
made
for
cheerfulness
his
father
to
begin
with
had
put
himself
gloriously
right
with
the
school
and
had
very
wisely
left
in
the
hour
of
supreme
popularity
so
that
there
was
no
fear
of
his
forfeiting
by
gaiters
or
christian
names
or
flat
headers
at
the
or
any
such
tragic
follies
the
esteem
he
had
won
for
greatly
daring
as
it
seemed
to
the
boys
he
had
asked
the
head
to
grant
an
extra
and
the
announcement
that
it
would
be
given
this
afternoon
in
honour
of
his
visit
had
duly
appeared
on
the
school
it
was
supposed
by
some
one
who
had
seen
his
flat
header
that
the
phrase
in
honour
of
his
visit
must
mark
a
sarcastic
intention
on
the
part
of
the
head
but
whether
that
was
so
or
not
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
which
was
all
that
mattered
even
david
when
quite
respectfully
appealed
to
had
no
clear
idea
as
to
why
his
father
s
visit
was
an
honour
but
supposed
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
the
books
he
wrote
which
were
printed
by
the
clarendon
press
at
oxford
in
any
case
he
felt
quite
certain
now
that
all
the
errors
of
which
his
father
had
been
guilty
would
be
pardoned
and
forgotten
and
that
he
would
never
hear
any
more
of
his
hat
or
his
gaiters
of
his
excruciating
performance
at
the
of
his
into
the
of
his
betrayal
of
his
own
son
s
christian
name
or
finally
of
the
disastrous
discourse
he
had
unfortunately
delivered
at
on
sunday
evening
for
the
moment
as
he
remembered
that
david
s
whistle
ceased
and
he
clutched
at
the
five
shillings
and
the
monarch
s
for
comfort
it
had
been
too
awful
not
only
had
he
talked
the
most
dreadful
rot
about
the
joy
and
peace
of
the
chapel
services
same
as
last
year
only
worse
under
the
influence
of
which
all
troubles
and
anxiety
melted
away
but
he
had
gone
on
and
on
and
on
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled
for
forty
stricken
minutes
he
had
detained
them
stone
said
which
beat
all
known
records
by
at
least
nine
minutes
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
boy
next
david
had
written
and
now
in
capital
letters
on
the
of
his
and
passed
it
to
him
but
that
was
all
over
he
had
made
the
most
honourable
amends
and
david
knew
that
his
father
would
be
considered
a
credit
to
him
indeed
that
he
was
a
old
buffer
was
quite
a
moderate
estimate
of
him
and
one
given
by
the
most
critical
there
were
other
satisfactory
points
about
him
also
he
had
asked
that
david
should
be
allowed
to
see
him
off
at
the
station
so
that
he
could
have
a
further
talk
with
him
this
meant
missing
half
an
hour
or
more
if
he
lingered
on
his
way
back
as
he
was
doing
of
repetition
of
latin
prose
david
had
not
been
certain
at
starting
that
he
would
not
sooner
do
prose
repetition
than
have
more
jaw
but
the
jaw
when
it
came
was
of
the
most
delightful
kind
not
only
was
he
certainly
to
go
to
marchester
in
september
but
after
consultation
with
the
head
it
had
been
settled
that
he
was
to
go
there
next
week
to
try
for
one
of
the
scholarships
a
wholly
lovely
adventure
was
news
to
work
had
shown
great
improvement
during
this
last
term
it
showed
signs
of
perception
and
taste
and
though
greatly
wanting
in
accuracy
which
the
archdeacon
reminded
him
could
always
be
attained
by
the
industrious
and
painstaking
it
might
prove
up
to
david
did
not
attend
much
to
these
generalities
the
point
was
that
he
would
go
to
marchester
for
a
examination
next
week
finally
as
a
cause
of
happiness
his
father
had
on
the
platform
presented
him
with
the
five
shillings
that
now
he
clutched
in
his
pocket
to
commemorate
his
having
got
into
the
school
eleven
that
presentation
had
been
so
sheer
a
surprise
that
david
could
have
fallen
flat
on
his
face
with
astonishment
he
would
have
expected
if
the
fatal
topic
of
cricket
was
to
occur
again
to
be
reminded
that
it
was
only
a
game
and
to
be
bidden
to
take
thought
of
it
just
as
such
and
no
more
but
to
be
tipped
on
such
a
scale
had
not
entered
into
his
most
sanguine
calculations
then
the
train
had
come
in
and
david
submitted
to
be
kissed
publicly
without
shying
even
though
a
small
vendor
of
papers
with
whom
he
had
slight
differences
before
this
ceased
shouting
dily
mile
and
squeaked
kiss
me
ducky
in
perfectly
audible
tones
he
could
be
dealt
with
after
the
train
had
gone
so
his
father
waved
his
from
the
window
and
david
his
straw
hat
from
the
platform
after
which
he
twitched
off
the
paper
vendor
s
cap
and
rubbed
his
face
upwards
with
it
and
hit
him
on
the
hands
so
that
he
dropped
all
his
papers
and
strolled
back
to
school
again
in
the
highest
spirits
and
not
only
were
his
spirits
high
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
conscious
of
how
happy
he
was
instead
of
just
being
happy
this
morning
he
seemed
to
stand
away
from
himself
and
envy
the
boy
only
it
was
himself
who
was
going
to
try
for
a
marchester
scholarship
next
week
and
was
certainly
going
there
in
september
and
had
five
shillings
and
two
in
his
pocket
and
was
in
the
school
eleven
child
though
he
was
consciousness
of
self
had
come
to
him
he
knew
that
his
head
was
full
of
delightful
plans
that
his
limbs
were
taut
and
strong
that
he
was
set
in
the
enchanted
garden
of
the
world
he
said
by
gosh
and
saluted
the
discovery
by
kicking
an
empty
that
lay
in
the
road
with
such
firm
accuracy
that
it
flew
with
a
whirring
sound
over
the
fence
of
the
house
where
the
assistant
masters
of
the
school
lodged
and
david
thought
it
wise
to
go
swiftly
away
and
not
look
behind
he
dropped
to
a
sober
pace
again
after
putting
a
corner
between
himself
and
the
masters
house
into
the
garden
of
which
the
empty
tin
had
so
pleasantly
flown
and
from
mere
happiness
made
a
quantity
of
good
resolutions
one
of
which
he
immediately
put
into
effect
by
not
going
into
the
where
he
had
originally
intended
to
buy
a
packet
of
cigarettes
as
a
present
for
the
smoking
club
just
now
the
solid
satisfaction
of
life
rendered
unnecessary
such
minor
adjuncts
and
since
he
did
not
like
smoking
it
was
convenient
that
it
happened
to
be
contrary
to
school
rules
there
were
such
hosts
of
things
pleasant
and
not
against
school
rules
that
he
wished
by
way
of
a
for
them
to
resolve
on
a
virtuous
life
he
really
would
get
up
at
the
sound
of
the
first
bell
in
the
morning
for
the
future
he
would
not
smoke
any
more
he
would
not
look
up
the
answers
to
sums
before
he
wrestled
with
them
nor
copy
out
on
his
the
principal
rivers
of
russia
they
were
there
now
in
fact
and
in
this
sudden
access
of
being
good
because
he
was
happy
he
stopped
then
and
there
and
with
a
piece
of
expunged
the
volga
and
the
vistula
and
the
don
and
the
dnieper
and
as
if
to
reward
him
just
as
he
got
to
the
eleven
o
clock
sounded
which
meant
that
latin
prose
repetition
was
over
and
since
was
a
there
was
only
one
more
hour
of
school
and
that
was
english
literature
the
one
lesson
of
the
week
which
he
actively
enjoyed
and
though
the
head
usually
took
it
was
not
in
the
least
terrifying
he
asked
but
few
questions
or
sometimes
there
were
no
questions
at
all
but
he
would
read
to
them
a
poem
with
explanations
of
difficult
words
or
sentences
so
that
any
one
could
understand
it
and
then
perhaps
shut
the
book
and
repeat
it
very
slowly
in
his
deep
smooth
voice
so
that
the
magic
of
beautiful
words
wove
its
spell
round
david
s
wondering
mind
on
his
way
to
the
museum
just
as
david
passed
the
long
french
windows
of
the
head
s
study
he
stepped
out
and
called
him
so
you
ve
seen
your
father
off
blaize
he
asked
yes
sir
thank
you
sir
said
david
beaming
ah
well
we
ll
take
a
little
stroll
across
the
field
you
and
i
before
we
begin
our
english
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
rhadamanthus
unbent
when
the
man
who
could
be
so
terrible
became
wholly
enchanting
a
man
not
to
fear
but
to
love
these
days
were
not
common
but
when
they
came
they
were
golden
and
now
that
tremendous
person
who
had
been
a
at
oxford
who
was
the
incarnation
of
fate
and
retribution
laid
his
arm
over
david
s
shoulder
and
put
aside
his
terrors
i
had
a
long
talk
to
your
father
david
he
said
no
no
one
can
hear
me
call
you
david
don
t
be
alarmed
and
no
doubt
he
has
told
you
part
of
what
we
said
that
you
are
to
go
up
for
a
scholarship
at
marchester
next
week
do
your
best
won
t
you
and
be
a
credit
not
to
me
which
doesn
t
matter
so
much
but
to
yourself
and
i
told
your
father
i
was
proud
of
you
and
i
meant
it
you
and
i
have
had
what
they
call
words
before
now
haven
t
we
in
fact
i
m
afraid
that
sometimes
it
has
come
to
blows
you
have
often
been
most
unsatisfactory
idle
and
careless
and
disobedient
i
dare
say
there
s
not
a
single
school
rule
that
you
haven
t
broken
but
i
told
your
father
that
i
had
never
found
you
mean
nor
bestial
i
look
upon
you
as
a
boy
i
can
david
s
young
skin
flushed
with
pleasure
and
then
went
white
again
with
a
resolution
that
frightened
himself
ve
done
lots
of
things
you
don
t
know
about
sir
he
said
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
you
should
think
me
the
head
stopped
and
david
s
heart
sank
into
his
boots
what
an
ass
he
had
been
to
say
that
why
not
have
received
this
handsome
tribute
however
undeserved
without
disturbing
the
misplaced
faith
that
prompted
it
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
had
done
it
deliberately
and
because
he
had
to
do
you
wish
to
tell
me
about
them
asked
the
head
but
his
voice
was
still
quiet
and
kind
david
seemed
to
himself
to
be
going
mad
he
just
heard
his
voice
in
a
quaking
whisper
say
yes
well
then
david
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
them
said
this
astounding
man
though
i
thank
you
for
wishing
to
tell
me
i
feel
sure
you
have
broken
rules
of
school
often
enough
but
i
don
t
think
you
have
broken
rules
of
character
they
are
much
more
important
though
school
rules
have
got
to
be
kept
as
suddenly
his
grip
on
david
s
shoulder
tightened
and
his
eye
fixed
itself
on
the
back
of
a
small
boy
who
was
sitting
on
the
wire
railing
at
the
edge
of
the
field
unconscious
of
their
approach
ferrers
minor
i
think
he
called
out
in
an
awful
voice
the
head
thought
right
and
ferrers
minor
presented
his
startled
and
dejected
countenance
did
you
or
did
you
not
know
the
rule
about
sitting
on
the
railings
demanded
the
head
yes
sir
said
ferrers
minor
then
this
is
wilful
disobedience
thundered
the
head
i
will
not
be
bullied
by
you
ferrers
minor
nor
have
you
disregard
the
rules
with
which
you
are
perfectly
well
acquainted
i
suppose
you
wish
to
make
a
fool
of
me
to
hold
me
up
to
ridicule
for
having
the
impertinence
to
frame
rules
which
ferrers
minor
keeps
or
not
as
he
finds
convenient
was
that
your
plan
sir
said
ferrers
minor
then
i
will
make
a
plan
for
you
instead
and
it
is
that
you
write
out
in
your
best
i
will
not
sit
on
the
railings
like
an
ass
a
hundred
times
you
may
go
ferrers
but
rhadamanthus
the
inexorable
terror
had
only
mounted
his
judgment
throne
for
a
moment
and
came
down
off
it
again
his
grip
relaxed
and
he
patted
david
s
shoulder
and
now
for
our
literature
lesson
he
said
it
s
too
hot
to
hold
it
in
the
museum
isn
t
it
blaize
when
we
can
sit
under
the
trees
instead
let
s
have
it
out
here
go
in
will
you
and
tell
the
class
to
come
out
and
personally
i
shall
take
my
coat
off
and
anybody
else
who
likes
to
do
the
same
of
course
the
boys
trooped
out
at
david
s
summons
peeling
off
their
coats
and
grouped
themselves
in
the
shade
of
the
four
big
elms
that
stood
in
a
quadrilateral
clump
at
the
edge
of
the
field
the
head
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
leaning
on
his
elbows
lay
on
that
part
of
his
person
which
in
ordinary
mortals
is
called
the
stomach
with
a
book
or
two
in
front
of
him
all
comfortably
settled
he
said
that
s
all
right
now
i
m
going
to
talk
to
you
about
a
man
whom
very
likely
you
have
never
heard
of
and
read
you
something
he
wrote
his
name
was
keats
john
keats
has
anybody
heard
of
him
nobody
had
he
was
a
chemist
s
assistant
said
the
head
and
if
some
ninety
or
a
years
ago
you
stone
or
you
blaize
had
gone
into
a
doctor
s
little
dispensary
near
hampstead
to
get
a
dose
because
you
had
a
pain
in
your
inside
from
eating
too
many
strawberries
or
from
having
shirked
into
richmond
and
devoured
more
than
a
sufficiency
of
maids
of
honour
you
might
have
had
your
medicine
given
you
by
one
of
the
greatest
lyrical
poets
who
ever
lived
the
doctor
s
assistant
a
pale
young
man
with
a
bad
cough
might
perhaps
have
mixed
it
for
you
and
if
you
were
wide
awake
you
might
have
seen
that
when
he
got
up
to
give
you
your
pill
or
your
powder
he
laid
down
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
was
scribbling
stone
if
you
leave
that
wasp
alone
he
will
not
get
angry
and
sting
you
or
lose
his
head
and
think
it
was
me
who
was
annoying
him
yes
and
then
when
you
had
paid
your
twopence
and
gone
away
with
your
pill
you
may
be
sure
he
would
have
taken
up
his
pencil
and
paper
again
no
doubt
if
you
had
asked
him
he
would
have
copied
out
for
you
what
he
was
writing
on
another
piece
of
paper
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
wrap
up
parcels
and
wondered
that
you
cared
to
pay
another
twopence
for
it
but
if
you
sold
that
piece
of
paper
you
would
get
not
twopence
but
hundreds
of
pounds
for
it
for
on
it
would
be
written
lines
by
john
keats
in
his
own
hand
and
what
you
might
have
found
on
that
piece
of
paper
is
this
my
heart
aches
and
a
drowsy
numbness
pains
my
sense
as
though
of
hemlock
i
had
drunk
or
emptied
some
dull
opiate
to
the
drains
a
minute
since
and
lethe
wards
have
sunk
lethe
we
had
in
our
homer
not
long
ago
lethe
the
water
of
forgetfulness
sometimes
i
think
blaize
and
others
of
you
have
drunk
it
tis
not
through
envy
of
thy
happy
lot
but
being
too
happy
in
thy
happiness
that
thou
dryad
of
the
trees
in
some
melodious
plot
of
beechen
green
and
shadows
numberless
dreamest
of
summer
in
he
read
on
occasionally
stopping
to
explain
a
word
once
and
again
his
voice
trembled
as
it
did
sometimes
when
he
preached
once
it
nearly
stopped
altogether
as
he
came
to
the
lines
perhaps
the
song
that
found
a
path
through
the
sad
heart
of
ruth
when
sick
for
home
she
stood
in
tears
amid
the
alien
corn
in
tears
amid
the
alien
corn
he
repeated
the
entire
informality
of
these
proceedings
the
absence
of
the
sense
that
they
were
being
taught
and
had
got
to
learn
disarmed
the
boys
and
before
this
stanza
was
reached
the
fact
that
it
was
the
portentous
head
who
was
reading
to
them
had
quite
vanished
they
were
all
sitting
or
lying
about
at
ease
on
the
grass
one
or
two
of
them
listening
intently
the
others
for
the
most
part
feeling
just
lazy
and
soothed
and
comfortable
but
among
the
intent
listeners
was
david
and
as
the
head
paused
and
repeated
alien
corn
he
rolled
over
on
to
his
back
absorbed
and
lost
golly
he
said
quietly
to
himself
oh
golly
then
he
became
aware
that
he
had
spoken
aloud
but
scarcely
wondered
whether
the
head
had
heard
or
not
so
completely
did
the
magic
of
the
words
possess
him
and
in
some
mysterious
way
they
added
to
his
store
of
happiness
they
became
part
of
him
and
thus
part
of
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
marchester
next
week
and
would
see
hughes
that
there
was
a
this
afternoon
that
he
was
in
the
eleven
keats
s
poem
was
part
of
the
whole
joy
of
life
it
and
its
music
and
the
sense
of
longing
for
something
he
did
not
know
about
which
it
produced
in
him
then
his
attention
was
completely
diverted
by
the
feeling
of
a
slight
vibration
in
his
caused
by
the
movements
of
the
monarch
and
his
wife
who
were
there
in
their
and
now
that
he
recollected
them
became
part
of
the
beneficent
joy
of
things
in
general
so
for
fear
of
their
not
getting
their
proper
share
of
the
oxygen
of
the
world
he
withdrew
the
box
from
his
pocket
laid
it
on
the
grass
and
forgot
about
them
again
in
hearing
of
the
foam
of
perilous
the
head
finished
the
ode
and
invited
questions
stone
wanted
to
know
what
hippocrene
was
thinking
this
an
intelligent
question
but
ferrers
s
inquiry
as
to
what
the
magic
casements
were
earned
stronger
approbation
from
the
head
who
mysteriously
told
him
that
no
one
could
tell
till
they
looked
out
on
to
the
perilous
it
was
not
like
the
commentaries
of
julius
c√¶sar
this
which
he
had
read
them
because
it
could
mean
different
things
to
different
people
each
sentence
of
the
commentaries
meant
one
thing
and
it
was
the
business
of
boys
to
find
out
with
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
what
it
was
but
music
and
poetry
were
altogether
different
they
meant
to
you
what
you
were
capable
of
finding
in
them
then
he
turned
to
david
who
alone
of
the
class
had
not
asked
any
questions
intelligent
or
otherwise
nothing
you
want
to
know
blaize
he
asked
no
thank
you
sir
said
david
but
would
you
read
it
us
again
sir
as
you
do
sometimes
the
head
sat
up
clasping
his
knees
with
his
arms
and
without
answering
david
began
the
ode
again
in
that
extraordinary
voice
of
his
this
time
not
looking
at
his
book
he
began
in
tones
so
low
that
it
needed
an
effort
to
hear
him
it
boomed
out
over
charioted
by
bacchus
and
his
pards
it
sounded
like
a
breeze
at
night
in
the
stanza
i
can
not
see
what
flowers
are
at
my
feet
again
it
shook
with
emotion
over
the
sad
heart
of
ruth
and
david
felt
a
lump
rise
in
his
throat
a
mysteriously
blissful
misery
took
possession
of
him
and
when
the
head
finished
he
found
himself
smiling
at
him
with
mouth
that
trembled
a
little
there
was
silence
a
moment
that
will
do
for
said
the
head
you
can
the
group
rose
from
the
grass
with
alacrity
for
though
keats
was
all
very
well
an
extra
at
the
for
the
lesson
had
been
very
short
was
even
better
but
in
spite
of
the
permission
david
lingered
did
he
write
much
else
sir
he
said
the
head
handed
him
the
volume
you
may
see
for
yourself
he
said
give
it
me
back
when
you
ve
finished
with
david
deposited
this
in
his
desk
in
the
museum
and
then
ran
after
the
others
to
the
with
lines
still
ringing
in
his
head
but
untying
and
unbuttoning
as
he
went
so
as
to
lose
as
few
seconds
as
possible
before
the
first
heavenly
plunge
out
of
the
heat
and
baking
sunlight
into
the
cool
arms
of
the
water
that
too
on
this
morning
of
vivid
life
was
more
consciously
delicious
than
ever
before
when
with
a
long
run
he
sprang
an
arrow
of
gleaming
limbs
off
the
which
he
left
vibrating
with
his
leap
and
burrowed
into
the
cool
embrace
of
the
water
some
flower
must
have
opened
in
his
brain
quickening
his
sense
of
living
and
though
no
whit
less
boyish
than
before
he
was
far
more
conscious
of
the
water
and
the
sun
and
above
all
of
himself
he
swam
and
floated
and
dived
came
swiftly
up
behind
stone
who
swam
in
rather
a
manner
and
with
a
firm
hand
placed
suddenly
on
the
top
of
his
head
sent
him
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bath
and
before
he
came
up
again
spluttering
and
more
than
ever
was
floating
with
arms
and
legs
spread
fashion
gazing
serenely
and
unconsciously
into
the
sky
stone
concluded
mistakenly
that
it
was
ferrers
who
had
done
this
thing
and
raised
a
storm
of
splashing
in
his
indignant
face
and
got
ducked
again
for
that
and
so
precisely
flicked
with
a
wet
towel
when
he
came
out
that
he
cried
on
the
name
of
his
maker
and
danced
with
the
shrewdness
of
the
touch
upon
which
david
forgetting
that
his
mouth
was
submerged
laughed
and
thereon
swallowed
so
much
water
that
he
had
to
come
out
and
lie
face
downwards
on
the
grass
in
order
to
disgorge
it
that
was
pleasant
also
and
he
lay
there
on
the
grass
with
his
forehead
on
his
arms
till
his
back
was
dry
and
baked
then
making
a
compact
parcel
of
himself
with
his
hands
clasped
round
his
ankles
two
friends
lifted
him
and
swung
him
into
the
water
again
bags
the
unbathed
had
brought
down
some
strawberries
and
newly
baked
buns
and
david
having
filled
himself
up
with
those
things
took
to
the
water
again
in
spite
of
ferrers
s
warning
that
if
you
bathed
directly
after
a
heavy
meal
you
got
cramp
in
your
stomach
and
sank
like
a
stone
to
rise
no
more
it
was
necessary
to
test
the
truth
of
this
remarkable
legend
and
it
was
found
to
be
wholly
untrustworthy
and
all
the
time
the
magic
casements
and
the
alien
corn
wandered
fragmentarily
in
his
head
the
first
eleven
played
the
next
sixteen
that
afternoon
and
still
that
happy
tide
of
the
consciousness
of
life
and
the
beautiful
jolly
things
of
life
bore
david
along
he
made
a
catch
of
an
unparalleled
order
off
his
own
bowling
from
a
hit
so
smart
that
he
had
only
meant
to
put
up
his
hands
to
protect
his
face
and
the
ball
stuck
in
them
to
his
great
surprise
and
hurt
more
than
anything
had
ever
hurt
subsequently
he
made
thirty
runs
after
being
missed
three
times
which
added
zest
to
the
performance
and
took
the
head
s
volume
of
keats
up
to
bed
with
him
but
glanders
being
ill
and
the
dormitory
unpatrolled
he
had
a
wonderful
with
bags
instead
of
reading
and
did
not
as
his
custom
was
go
instantly
to
sleep
when
at
length
he
got
into
bed
instead
he
lay
in
a
lump
with
his
hands
round
his
knees
saying
jolly
happy
jolly
jolly
happy
by
gad
fairy
lands
forlorn
fairy
lands
gosh
how
that
catch
hurt
but
what
frightful
sport
marchester
next
week
too
five
bob
and
these
images
lost
their
outline
and
became
blurred
with
the
approach
of
sleep
one
of
the
at
marchester
was
an
old
friend
of
the
archdeacon
and
it
had
been
arranged
that
david
should
stay
with
adams
when
he
went
up
for
his
scholarship
examination
hughes
david
s
great
chum
of
a
year
ago
was
in
adams
s
house
and
by
permission
met
him
at
the
station
and
after
the
first
greetings
looked
david
over
with
an
eye
made
critical
by
the
adamantine
traditions
that
bind
junior
boys
at
public
schools
hughes
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
but
he
had
certainly
been
very
anxious
to
get
an
early
and
private
view
of
him
to
see
if
he
came
up
to
the
standards
and
ordinances
then
prevailing
and
make
such
corrections
in
his
bearing
and
attire
as
were
necessary
it
would
be
an
awful
thing
for
instance
if
david
turned
up
in
a
straw
hat
with
his
school
eleven
colours
as
those
were
identical
with
the
rugby
fifteen
colours
at
marchester
and
to
be
seen
walking
about
with
a
small
alien
boy
in
fifteen
colours
was
a
nightmare
possibility
but
there
was
a
lot
as
he
saw
at
once
to
be
said
in
david
s
favour
his
clothes
were
neat
he
looked
exceedingly
clean
not
grubby
a
thing
which
hughes
from
his
faded
reminiscences
of
helmsworth
was
dismally
afraid
of
his
hair
was
short
behind
and
well
inside
his
collar
and
he
stood
straight
on
the
other
hand
there
were
certain
details
that
must
be
altered
i
say
have
you
been
travelling
in
a
smoker
he
asked
second
david
wished
he
had
spent
his
last
shilling
in
going
first
yes
first
was
so
frightfully
expensive
said
david
oh
i
didn
t
mean
that
all
the
fellows
go
third
yes
the
bus
will
take
your
luggage
up
and
we
ll
walk
shall
we
it
ll
take
the
fug
of
the
out
of
your
david
marvelled
at
this
he
had
thought
a
must
be
the
manly
thing
he
had
a
packet
of
cigarettes
also
in
his
don
t
fellows
smoke
here
he
asked
looking
up
in
timid
admiration
at
hughes
who
had
grown
enormously
oh
yes
in
some
scuggy
houses
he
said
but
not
in
adams
s
it
s
thought
frightfully
bad
form
in
adams
s
david
fingered
his
packet
of
cigarettes
nervously
conscious
suddenly
of
the
enormous
gulf
that
yawned
between
a
private
and
a
public
school
and
yearning
to
bridge
it
over
by
every
means
in
his
power
i
ve
got
some
cigarettes
in
my
pocket
he
said
oh
chuck
them
away
said
his
friend
or
give
them
to
a
porter
it
would
be
a
rotten
affair
if
any
of
the
fellows
in
the
house
knew
you
d
come
here
with
a
bad
david
s
face
fell
for
a
moment
for
those
were
cigarettes
which
he
had
thought
would
probably
be
so
exceedingly
the
right
thing
hughes
noticed
this
and
gave
consolation
for
really
blaize
was
extremely
presentable
i
say
blazes
he
said
i
m
awfully
glad
to
see
you
and
we
ll
have
a
ripping
time
but
it
s
best
to
tell
you
what
s
the
right
thing
and
what
isn
t
don
t
you
think
david
responded
cordially
to
this
rather
he
said
and
it
s
jolly
good
of
you
thanks
awfully
do
tell
me
if
there
s
anything
hughes
gave
him
another
critical
glance
as
solemn
as
a
tailor
s
when
looking
at
the
fit
of
a
coat
that
he
wants
to
be
a
credit
to
him
oh
well
that
buttonhole
he
said
i
think
i
should
take
that
out
only
tremendous
swells
wear
them
and
even
then
it
s
rather
david
instantly
plucked
out
the
offending
vegetable
he
probably
would
have
torn
out
a
handful
of
his
hair
if
crisp
yellow
locks
showed
hughes
nodded
at
him
approvingly
now
you
re
he
said
oh
just
send
your
stick
up
with
your
luggage
now
come
on
you
look
just
as
if
you
were
at
marchester
already
you
see
i
got
leave
for
you
to
come
and
tea
you
my
study
this
afternoon
and
it
would
have
been
beastly
for
both
of
us
if
you
weren
t
up
to
adams
s
form
and
it
turned
out
that
you
smoked
or
kept
white
mice
or
something
the
two
handsome
boys
went
on
their
way
up
to
the
mecca
of
david
s
aspirations
and
he
thought
with
the
deepest
relief
of
his
decision
not
to
bring
the
monarch
and
his
wife
with
him
it
had
been
a
wrench
to
part
with
them
even
for
a
few
days
and
an
anxiety
to
leave
them
even
in
the
care
of
the
assiduous
bags
to
whom
he
had
given
a
paper
of
directions
about
diet
and
fresh
air
but
if
it
was
hopeless
to
keep
white
mice
how
much
more
dire
would
have
been
his
position
if
he
had
been
found
possessed
of
or
if
as
might
easily
have
happened
without
this
oblique
warning
he
had
incidentally
mentioned
to
some
of
hughes
s
friends
that
his
tastes
lay
in
those
verminous
directions
and
hughes
proceeded
inspired
by
that
authoritative
conventionality
which
public
schools
so
teach
that
every
junior
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
in
any
house
is
in
characteristics
of
behaviour
exactly
like
every
other
at
one
time
buttonholes
and
smoking
are
at
another
they
are
quite
impossible
at
one
time
it
is
the
fashion
to
be
industrious
and
every
one
works
at
another
to
be
as
idle
as
is
possible
morals
are
subject
to
the
same
strict
but
changeable
etiquette
for
years
perhaps
the
most
admirable
tone
characterises
a
house
then
another
code
obtains
and
satan
himself
might
be
staggered
at
the
result
jove
it
was
a
good
thing
i
came
to
the
station
he
said
and
i
wanted
to
too
else
you
might
have
appeared
with
a
stick
and
a
buttonhole
and
a
cigarette
and
a
for
all
i
knew
do
you
remember
we
had
a
you
and
i
at
helmsworth
of
course
some
fellows
go
in
for
natural
history
and
maddox
who
s
the
head
of
our
house
collects
butterflies
but
then
he
s
such
a
swell
he
can
do
just
what
he
likes
i
m
his
fag
you
know
and
he
s
awfully
jolly
to
me
damned
hot
it
is
let
s
walk
david
was
extremely
quick
at
picking
up
an
atmosphere
and
he
made
the
perfectly
correct
conclusion
that
though
smoking
was
bad
form
swearing
was
not
but
the
mention
of
maddox
roused
the
thrill
and
glamour
of
more
complete
and
entire
than
is
ever
accorded
by
the
world
of
men
and
women
to
their
most
august
idols
oh
go
on
tell
me
about
maddox
he
said
i
dare
say
you
ll
see
him
sure
to
in
fact
he
s
not
very
tall
but
he
s
damned
he
s
far
the
finest
bat
in
the
eleven
and
the
funny
thing
is
he
says
cricket
s
rather
a
waste
of
time
and
hardly
ever
goes
up
to
a
net
he
s
editor
of
the
and
played
racquets
for
us
at
queen
s
last
year
but
what
he
likes
best
of
all
is
that
s
queer
said
david
tis
rather
he
makes
all
our
juniors
work
too
i
can
tell
you
but
he
ll
help
anybody
and
he
ll
always
give
you
a
construe
of
a
bit
you
don
t
understand
if
you
ve
looked
out
all
the
words
first
and
he
s
only
just
seventeen
think
of
that
so
that
he
ll
have
two
more
years
here
he
never
plays
footer
though
he
can
run
like
hell
and
says
rugby
is
a
barbarous
sport
and
in
the
winter
when
he
s
not
playing
racquets
he
just
reads
and
reads
his
mother
was
french
too
rum
thing
that
and
the
point
is
that
that
s
hairy
toe
an
awful
ass
who
teaches
french
is
english
and
maddox
knows
about
twice
as
much
as
he
he
makes
awful
howlers
maddox
says
and
pronounces
just
as
if
he
was
a
cad
but
that
s
all
right
because
he
david
skipped
with
uncontrollable
emotion
oh
i
say
how
ripping
he
said
but
i
wish
maddox
liked
cricket
and
well
footer
he
detests
but
he
only
means
that
thinking
of
nothing
but
cricket
is
a
waste
of
time
by
the
way
you
re
in
luck
there
s
a
match
begins
against
barnard
s
team
friday
s
a
whole
holiday
some
frowsy
saint
they
say
jessop
s
coming
wouldn
t
it
be
sport
to
see
him
hit
a
dozen
sixes
and
then
be
by
cruikshank
oh
and
who
s
cruikshank
asked
david
well
that
s
damned
funny
not
to
have
heard
of
cruikshank
fastest
bowler
we
ve
ever
had
and
he
s
in
adams
s
too
he
and
maddox
don
t
get
on
a
bit
though
of
course
they
re
awfully
polite
to
each
other
cruikshank
s
awfully
pi
fit
to
burst
here
we
hughes
again
cast
an
anxious
eye
over
david
for
the
moment
was
momentous
as
the
whole
school
would
be
about
but
he
really
felt
that
david
would
do
him
credit
they
paused
a
moment
in
the
gateway
if
you
like
we
ll
stroll
round
the
court
he
said
before
we
go
down
to
house
there
s
chapel
you
see
and
hall
next
beyond
it
foul
place
stinks
of
mutton
then
two
more
college
but
which
is
adams
s
asked
david
oh
that
s
not
here
these
are
all
college
houses
and
rather
scuggy
compared
to
then
there
s
fifth
form
and
sixth
form
and
school
library
up
on
top
i
dare
say
maddox
is
there
now
big
school
behind
more
and
then
the
like
to
walk
through
no
devout
catholic
ever
went
to
rome
in
more
pilgrimage
than
was
this
to
david
it
was
the
temple
of
his
religion
that
he
saw
the
public
school
which
was
to
be
his
home
his
horizon
and
aspirations
stretched
no
farther
than
this
arena
for
to
the
eyes
of
the
those
who
have
finished
with
their
public
school
and
have
gone
out
from
it
to
the
universities
are
already
past
their
prime
they
are
old
they
are
done
with
unless
the
fact
that
they
play
cricket
for
oxford
or
cambridge
gives
them
a
little
longer
lease
of
immortality
but
to
be
a
great
man
a
maddox
or
a
cruikshank
in
this
theatre
of
life
which
already
his
feet
trod
was
the
utmost
dream
of
david
s
ambitions
and
if
at
the
hoary
age
of
eighteen
he
could
only
have
played
a
real
part
in
the
life
of
the
scenes
that
were
now
unrolling
to
him
he
felt
that
an
honoured
grave
would
be
the
natural
conclusion
everything
that
might
happen
after
public
school
was
over
seemed
a
posthumous
sort
of
affair
you
were
old
after
that
and
at
this
moment
even
the
head
for
all
his
terror
and
glamour
appeared
a
creature
hughes
exchanged
hullo
with
a
friend
or
two
and
said
right
four
to
one
of
them
which
made
david
long
to
know
what
heroic
thing
was
to
happen
then
and
took
him
past
the
east
end
of
chapel
without
further
comment
david
quickly
and
quite
mistakenly
drew
a
conclusion
based
on
his
private
school
experience
i
suppose
chapel
s
pretty
good
rot
he
said
this
was
worse
than
buttonholes
chapel
rot
said
hughes
why
it
s
perfectly
ripping
maddox
s
uncle
was
the
architect
it
s
the
finest
in
england
bar
eton
perhaps
you
ll
see
it
you
never
saw
anything
so
oh
sorry
said
david
flushing
but
i
didn
t
hughes
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
again
i
say
blazes
it
s
awful
sport
your
coming
down
like
this
he
said
do
sweat
your
eyes
out
over
this
exam
it
would
be
ripping
if
you
got
a
scholarship
we
re
all
working
like
beans
in
the
house
that
s
maddox
s
doing
work
s
quite
different
if
you
take
an
interest
in
it
you
know
yes
that
path
goes
down
to
the
and
there
are
nightingales
in
the
trees
then
hall
fuggy
spot
we
all
have
dinner
there
both
and
see
that
don
there
in
cap
and
gown
he
takes
the
fifth
form
he
s
frightfully
polite
and
is
learning
to
ride
a
bicycle
consequently
you
always
touch
your
cap
to
him
as
he
goes
wobbling
along
and
he
takes
a
hand
off
to
return
your
chaste
salute
and
falls
off
good
rag
there
s
his
with
the
library
up
above
we
ll
just
go
down
there
and
i
ll
answer
to
on
my
they
turned
out
of
the
big
court
into
an
asphalted
square
full
of
boys
a
master
was
standing
on
a
raised
dais
at
one
end
calling
out
names
with
extreme
deliberation
oh
damn
he
s
only
just
begun
said
hughes
after
listening
a
moment
we
won
t
he
touched
another
boy
on
the
shoulder
i
say
answer
for
me
plugs
he
said
you
owe
me
right
oh
what
s
your
voice
now
topknot
treble
or
bass
bout
midway
something
with
a
crack
in
it
thanks
plugs
whoever
plugs
was
saw
hughes
s
companion
who
s
your
friend
he
asked
from
my
t
other
school
decent
that
was
an
aside
but
clearly
audible
and
david
swelled
with
pride
and
tried
to
look
abnormally
decent
they
made
their
way
through
the
crowd
that
was
collecting
and
dispersing
as
the
proceeded
and
went
back
down
the
long
empty
passage
past
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
school
library
even
as
they
approached
them
there
was
a
clatter
of
feet
on
the
concrete
floor
above
and
a
boy
came
flying
down
them
four
steps
to
his
stride
beneath
one
arm
he
carried
a
sheaf
of
books
and
his
straw
hat
was
in
the
other
hand
maddox
said
hughes
quietly
and
on
the
moment
maddox
took
his
last
six
steps
in
one
leap
and
nearly
fell
over
them
both
all
the
of
which
david
was
capable
flared
up
never
did
hero
make
a
more
impressive
entrance
than
in
that
long
lithe
jump
that
landed
him
in
the
passage
he
nearly
knocked
hughes
down
and
dropped
all
his
books
but
caught
him
round
the
shoulders
and
steadied
him
again
there
was
a
splendid
crisp
vigour
about
every
line
of
his
body
his
black
short
hair
his
dark
face
topknot
you
silly
owl
he
said
don
t
get
in
a
man
s
light
when
he
s
in
a
hurry
haven
t
hurt
you
have
i
i
d
die
sooner
than
hurt
david
picked
up
the
scattered
books
and
maddox
turned
to
him
oh
thanks
awfully
he
said
you
re
topknot
s
pal
i
suppose
come
up
for
the
good
luck
he
nodded
to
david
flicked
the
end
of
hughes
s
nose
and
went
off
down
the
passage
to
the
room
whistling
louder
than
even
david
thought
possible
gosh
said
david
there
was
really
nothing
more
to
be
said
oh
he
s
always
like
that
remarked
hughes
feeling
that
the
meeting
could
not
have
been
more
impressive
and
he
wished
me
good
luck
said
david
still
feeling
dazzled
wasn
t
that
awfully
jolly
of
him
and
he
flicked
your
nose
same
as
you
might
flick
oh
lord
yes
said
hughes
after
this
all
that
immediately
followed
seemed
but
the
setting
and
stage
from
which
the
chief
actor
had
departed
for
that
glimpse
of
maddox
had
been
to
david
like
some
appearance
of
the
spirit
itself
of
public
school
soon
they
left
the
college
buildings
and
walked
down
some
quarter
of
a
mile
to
where
the
red
roofs
of
adams
s
rose
between
elms
they
had
to
cross
a
broad
where
rushes
twitched
in
the
current
and
cushions
of
waved
and
hughes
pointed
out
the
wagging
tail
of
a
great
fat
trout
who
was
supposed
to
have
baffled
the
wiles
of
all
fishermen
from
time
immemorial
arrived
at
the
house
they
had
to
part
for
david
as
a
guest
must
present
himself
formally
at
the
front
door
while
hughes
went
round
through
the
yard
where
was
going
on
to
the
boys
quarters
there
were
cheerful
cries
of
hullo
topknot
and
david
waiting
for
the
bell
to
be
answered
thrilled
again
at
the
thought
of
being
part
of
all
this
the
idea
of
adams
was
no
longer
formidable
though
he
had
pictured
him
as
being
rather
taller
than
the
head
he
was
shown
through
a
big
hall
into
adams
s
study
and
even
if
he
had
entered
in
trepidation
his
fears
would
have
been
at
once
set
at
rest
in
a
long
chair
by
the
open
window
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
while
two
boys
were
leaning
over
the
back
of
his
chair
sat
his
master
clerical
as
to
collar
but
with
a
blazer
on
instead
of
a
black
coat
just
as
david
entered
one
of
the
two
boys
scarcely
older
than
himself
to
all
appearance
and
with
a
shrill
voice
yet
unbroken
was
expostulating
with
him
oh
i
say
do
go
back
and
construe
that
again
sir
he
said
i
wasn
t
attending
adams
held
out
a
hand
to
david
that
s
right
he
said
delighted
to
see
you
just
wait
half
a
moment
now
ted
if
you
don
t
attend
this
time
i
will
not
go
over
it
ted
took
an
injured
tone
well
there
was
a
wasp
he
said
it
wasn
t
my
fault
please
get
on
quick
david
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
pleasant
a
room
nor
one
which
less
suggested
school
as
he
had
known
it
the
windows
looked
out
on
to
a
big
lawn
in
the
centre
of
which
two
boys
and
a
tall
girl
whom
he
conjectured
to
be
adams
s
daughter
were
playing
croquet
round
the
edge
were
cut
five
or
six
where
other
boys
were
putting
slightly
to
the
derangement
of
geranium
beds
and
half
a
dozen
more
were
sitting
in
the
shade
of
reading
and
talking
here
inside
two
occupied
the
sofa
and
as
david
waited
for
ted
to
be
construed
to
another
tall
fellow
strolled
in
and
lay
down
on
the
hearthrug
with
an
illustrated
paper
the
walls
were
lined
with
low
bookshelves
on
the
top
of
which
were
strewn
books
and
straw
hats
while
on
the
table
in
the
centre
was
a
litter
of
papers
and
in
the
middle
a
great
bowl
of
roses
honeysuckle
trailed
trumpeted
sprays
over
the
spaces
of
open
window
and
the
floor
was
bright
with
persian
rugs
the
construing
was
soon
over
and
adams
gave
the
book
back
to
one
of
the
boys
then
he
who
had
lain
down
on
the
hearthrug
looked
up
from
the
paper
sir
jessop
s
coming
down
he
said
adams
got
up
from
his
chair
then
get
him
out
at
once
with
the
very
fastest
ball
ever
bowled
crookles
he
said
some
one
from
the
sofa
joined
in
oh
don
t
be
too
hard
on
him
crookles
he
said
let
him
hit
you
over
the
pavilion
a
bit
david
s
eyes
took
on
their
most
reverential
roundness
without
doubt
this
must
be
cruikshank
the
fastest
bowler
the
school
had
ever
had
and
yet
he
had
a
casual
private
life
of
his
own
and
was
called
crookles
and
here
s
blaize
come
down
on
purpose
to
see
it
all
said
adams
and
incidentally
to
get
a
david
horrors
the
christian
name
again
but
nobody
appeared
to
think
it
the
least
ridiculous
any
more
than
that
ted
who
was
climbing
out
of
the
window
should
be
known
as
ted
adams
looked
rather
unfavourably
at
one
of
the
two
boys
on
the
sofa
ozzy
go
and
wash
your
hands
at
once
he
said
i
won
t
have
fellows
in
here
with
dirty
sir
mayn
t
i
just
began
ozzy
no
finish
when
you
re
clean
come
out
into
the
garden
david
how
s
your
father
topknot
met
you
at
the
station
didn
t
he
and
you
re
going
to
have
tea
with
him
we
might
find
some
david
was
packed
off
early
to
bed
that
night
in
order
that
his
brain
might
be
in
its
most
efficient
mood
for
his
examination
next
day
in
a
whirl
of
happy
excitement
never
in
all
his
had
he
conceived
that
adams
s
could
be
like
this
it
was
not
like
a
school
it
was
like
some
new
and
entrancing
kind
of
home
with
the
jolliest
man
he
had
ever
seen
as
a
master
and
father
and
for
family
these
friendly
boys
and
the
girl
adams
s
daughter
whom
everybody
called
by
her
christian
name
and
yet
the
glamour
of
public
school
lay
over
it
and
among
this
happy
family
there
moved
like
ordinary
mortals
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
maddox
and
cruikshank
and
westcott
captain
of
the
school
fifteen
behaving
like
everybody
else
and
seemingly
unconscious
of
their
divinity
and
these
heroes
had
been
seen
with
his
mortal
eyes
and
he
had
been
taken
by
hughes
into
maddox
s
study
after
tea
where
he
had
been
permitted
to
help
in
washing
up
his
that
to
him
was
the
vatican
a
room
some
twelve
feet
by
ten
in
material
dimensions
but
a
shrine
a
centre
there
were
books
merely
but
novels
books
of
poetry
books
in
french
which
maddox
read
for
his
own
amusement
and
a
press
of
rackets
were
piled
in
the
corner
and
such
space
on
the
walls
as
was
not
filled
with
books
was
a
mosaic
of
school
photographs
and
perhaps
most
astounding
of
all
though
maddox
had
his
school
cricket
colours
his
racket
and
five
colours
there
was
no
trace
of
those
glories
anywhere
instead
on
a
nail
behind
the
door
was
hung
a
straw
hat
with
just
the
on
it
which
david
himself
would
be
allowed
to
wear
next
september
somehow
that
was
tremendously
grand
it
was
like
a
king
who
had
the
right
to
cover
himself
with
stars
and
garters
preferring
to
go
out
to
dinner
in
ordinary
evening
dress
david
s
bedroom
was
in
the
private
part
of
the
house
but
next
door
was
one
of
the
boys
dormitories
merry
muffled
noises
leaked
through
the
walls
and
from
the
open
window
of
the
dormitory
there
came
into
his
room
whistlings
and
cheerful
riot
and
from
time
to
time
the
clump
of
boots
kicked
off
on
to
the
floor
by
degrees
these
sounds
grew
quiet
but
he
still
lay
in
contemplation
and
expectancy
the
most
trifling
preoccupation
was
always
sufficient
to
make
him
forget
to
say
his
prayers
and
he
had
got
into
bed
without
their
ever
occurring
to
him
but
as
he
lay
awake
among
the
million
surmises
that
came
to
him
about
life
in
this
enchanted
place
he
wondered
whether
fellows
in
the
house
said
their
prayers
since
chapel
apparently
was
a
thing
to
be
proud
of
and
on
the
moment
he
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
knelt
down
but
only
one
petition
seemed
possible
and
he
made
it
o
lord
let
me
get
a
scholarship
and
come
to
adams
s
he
said
very
fervently
he
thought
for
a
moment
but
really
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
that
his
heart
desired
amen
he
said
and
jumping
into
bed
again
fell
asleep
chapter
vi
it
was
the
morning
of
the
day
before
helmsworth
broke
up
examinations
were
over
lists
had
been
read
out
and
places
and
removes
assigned
to
those
who
would
reassemble
in
september
and
just
now
the
whole
school
was
employed
in
the
joyful
task
of
packing
this
was
not
an
affair
that
usually
demanded
anxious
consideration
it
consisted
in
shying
your
books
into
your
box
and
shaking
it
until
the
lid
consented
to
close
or
burst
in
the
attempt
but
david
on
this
particular
occasion
was
not
sure
that
it
was
very
joyful
and
as
an
outward
and
visible
sign
of
his
doubts
he
was
actually
packing
his
books
fitting
them
in
one
with
another
that
is
to
say
instead
of
making
salad
glorious
things
had
happened
and
a
dazzling
future
was
no
doubt
to
follow
but
he
was
dimly
aware
that
a
chapter
in
life
was
closing
which
in
spite
of
its
drawbacks
and
terrors
and
annoyances
had
been
jolly
he
had
been
happy
he
was
aware
without
knowing
it
and
whatever
the
future
held
it
would
not
hold
this
again
no
such
scruples
afflicted
ferrers
who
was
emptying
his
locker
into
his
in
the
manner
of
a
cheerful
cataract
holding
up
for
competition
anything
he
did
not
want
old
testament
maclear
he
said
for
an
old
testament
maclear
list
of
kings
of
israel
and
judah
in
it
with
lots
of
noughts
and
crosses
over
it
lord
i
d
like
to
make
a
parcel
of
it
and
send
it
to
dubs
without
any
stamps
david
was
considering
the
question
of
a
catapult
in
the
famous
visit
to
marchester
he
had
discovered
that
catapults
were
scuggy
inventions
but
he
had
at
present
been
unable
to
bring
himself
to
part
with
this
one
so
great
was
its
calibre
the
he
had
given
to
ferrers
minor
the
day
after
his
return
and
their
new
owner
had
sat
down
on
them
with
total
loss
of
life
a
few
hours
subsequently
and
now
he
hardened
himself
again
for
a
catapult
he
said
heroically
and
a
chorus
of
ego
answered
him
he
threw
it
to
stone
who
had
clearly
been
first
with
his
rotten
things
catapults
he
said
to
strengthen
himself
only
scugs
use
them
at
then
he
came
upon
the
smoking
club
badge
since
his
return
from
marchester
he
had
broken
with
the
but
since
as
a
leaving
gift
he
had
made
the
club
a
magnificent
present
of
cigarettes
and
a
holder
his
defection
had
not
roused
unpleasant
comment
but
the
badge
had
still
something
of
the
preciousness
of
the
past
about
it
he
remembered
the
pride
with
which
by
the
assistance
of
a
pair
of
tweezers
he
had
shaped
the
copper
wire
into
the
mystic
letters
he
slipped
it
into
his
there
was
a
loose
cricket
which
he
had
craftily
torn
out
of
the
book
because
it
showed
his
own
analysis
on
the
day
of
the
eagles
match
and
did
not
record
the
fact
that
he
had
missed
the
catch
which
lost
them
the
game
well
there
was
no
use
for
that
now
any
more
than
for
catapults
or
since
the
fellows
at
marchester
would
care
precious
little
what
his
had
been
against
a
private
school
of
which
nobody
had
ever
heard
they
had
not
heard
of
him
either
and
at
that
thought
david
saw
just
where
his
vague
regrets
and
melancholy
came
from
he
had
to
start
all
over
again
on
a
new
page
to
part
with
everything
that
for
its
own
sake
or
from
familiarity
had
become
dear
to
be
a
nobody
again
instead
of
being
a
big
boy
in
his
circle
he
had
been
used
to
consider
himself
rather
a
swell
with
an
assured
position
now
he
was
nobody
again
with
no
position
at
all
the
school
sergeant
the
minister
of
fate
who
brought
round
the
slips
of
blue
paper
on
which
the
head
had
written
the
name
of
culprits
whose
attendance
was
required
looked
in
at
this
moment
master
blaize
to
go
to
the
head
at
once
he
said
david
s
heart
stood
still
not
with
fear
but
with
suspense
for
the
last
three
days
he
had
hourly
expected
that
news
would
come
of
the
result
of
the
marchester
scholarship
examination
and
perhaps
this
meant
its
arrival
but
his
friends
thought
otherwise
and
ferrers
major
rattled
his
keys
and
slapped
a
book
with
suggestive
resonance
don
t
bully
me
sir
he
said
the
other
hand
sir
whack
whack
whack
all
in
the
same
place
the
fellow
who
was
going
to
take
all
the
wickets
in
the
old
boys
match
won
t
be
able
to
bowl
a
ball
whack
whack
sobs
and
cries
oh
piffle
said
david
getting
up
that
was
a
word
he
had
brought
back
from
marchester
and
was
new
to
the
helmsworth
vocabulary
he
had
distinctly
overworked
it
with
the
result
that
two
days
ago
there
had
been
a
piffle
conspiracy
against
him
whatever
question
that
is
to
say
that
david
asked
anybody
was
answered
by
piffle
which
became
rather
wearing
to
the
nerves
but
the
conspiracy
was
it
had
lasted
indeed
only
a
few
hours
since
david
distinctly
announced
that
he
would
firmly
hit
in
the
face
the
next
fellow
who
said
piffle
to
him
that
checked
off
the
juniors
at
once
but
unfortunately
there
were
others
and
when
david
the
moment
after
said
to
stone
will
you
come
and
bathe
stone
said
immediately
afterwards
stone
had
a
black
eye
and
david
a
bleeding
nose
but
he
went
for
the
next
piffler
with
undiminished
zeal
and
the
thing
had
dropped
for
it
was
not
worth
while
fighting
david
over
a
little
thing
like
that
he
also
had
dropped
the
use
of
the
word
and
this
time
it
slipped
out
by
accident
and
if
anybody
says
piffle
he
remarked
cheerfully
there
s
heaps
of
time
to
smash
him
silly
before
i
go
to
the
this
was
too
one
two
three
said
stone
and
the
whole
simultaneously
shouted
piffle
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
that
was
a
man≈ìuvre
previously
agreed
on
in
case
david
used
the
word
again
and
he
was
scored
off
oh
funny
asses
he
said
witheringly
which
was
about
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances
david
walked
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
head
s
study
with
a
suspended
heart
feeling
certain
that
this
was
scholarship
news
and
not
one
of
his
private
misdeeds
that
was
to
be
set
before
him
but
yet
hurriedly
attempting
to
recollect
the
omissions
and
trespasses
of
which
he
had
lately
been
guilty
but
he
credited
himself
with
so
stainless
a
record
that
he
was
really
open
to
the
damning
imputation
of
having
become
a
saint
for
the
effect
of
that
glimpse
of
public
school
life
had
been
magical
on
his
conduct
he
had
literally
not
cared
to
do
the
sort
of
things
any
more
that
spelt
trouble
at
helmsworth
at
marchester
for
example
only
scugs
smoked
and
therefore
the
temptation
of
so
doing
especially
since
he
did
not
like
it
had
ceased
to
beckon
him
the
only
reason
for
indulging
in
it
had
really
been
the
notion
that
it
was
grand
and
if
by
a
higher
standard
it
was
not
grand
at
all
the
point
of
it
was
gone
again
the
fact
that
at
adams
s
house
it
was
the
thing
to
work
had
made
industry
a
perfectly
palatable
mode
of
passing
the
time
or
where
when
he
had
once
seen
a
master
like
adams
was
the
use
of
cheeking
that
dreary
ass
dubs
you
couldn
t
cheek
dubs
any
more
it
was
beneath
you
to
do
any
such
thing
dubs
was
pure
piffle
there
had
been
a
paralysing
row
in
the
school
a
few
days
before
at
which
the
head
had
appeared
in
his
most
terrific
light
but
david
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
a
series
of
small
thefts
had
been
going
on
and
the
culprit
had
eventually
been
caught
in
a
dormitory
deserted
for
cricket
had
been
held
up
to
public
execration
and
expelled
that
scene
had
made
david
feel
sick
with
terror
personally
he
did
not
in
the
least
desire
to
steal
other
fellows
things
but
he
quaked
at
the
thought
of
being
made
the
scorn
of
the
assembled
school
as
had
happened
to
anstruther
he
supposed
that
his
whole
subsequent
life
would
be
cursed
and
blasted
as
indeed
the
head
had
assured
anstruther
that
his
was
david
tapped
at
the
door
and
entered
in
obedience
to
a
stern
gruff
permission
the
head
looked
up
frowning
blaize
yes
wait
a
he
finished
a
letter
reread
it
and
directed
it
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
that
was
one
of
his
great
ways
he
just
threw
letters
on
the
floor
if
he
wanted
them
to
be
posted
and
they
were
picked
up
and
stamped
i
have
just
heard
from
marchester
he
said
you
have
done
well
but
you
have
not
got
a
scholarship
there
were
six
given
and
you
were
eighth
on
the
list
don
t
be
discouraged
you
have
done
well
but
i
am
recommending
your
father
to
send
you
to
adams
s
house
anyhow
it
is
more
expensive
than
an
s
and
i
wish
you
had
got
a
scholarship
so
as
to
begin
helping
in
your
own
education
but
i
think
you
may
consider
that
you
will
go
to
adams
s
next
the
head
suddenly
took
his
keys
from
his
pocket
and
rattled
them
in
the
lock
of
the
drawer
that
held
the
canes
but
he
was
doing
it
so
it
seemed
to
david
in
a
sort
of
absence
of
mind
and
not
to
be
thinking
of
what
lay
within
then
leaving
them
there
he
got
up
and
rocked
across
to
the
fireplace
where
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
looking
gigantic
he
began
a
portentous
discourse
david
he
said
a
few
days
ago
you
saw
a
schoolfellow
publicly
expelled
i
saw
you
turn
white
i
saw
your
horror
at
the
task
that
was
forced
on
me
now
you
are
on
the
point
of
going
out
into
the
bigger
life
of
a
public
school
and
when
you
have
been
a
week
at
marchester
you
will
look
back
on
the
time
you
have
passed
here
as
a
sort
of
babyhood
and
wonder
whether
it
was
you
who
smoked
half
a
cigarette
now
and
then
and
cheeked
dutton
and
resurrection
pie
into
envelopes
and
burned
good
lord
thought
david
is
it
going
to
be
a
caning
for
sundries
apparently
it
wasn
t
but
you
will
find
continued
the
head
that
there
are
worse
things
than
smoking
and
all
the
misdeeds
you
may
or
may
not
have
been
punished
for
and
you
will
find
out
that
there
are
even
worse
things
than
stealing
and
that
many
quite
good
chaps
as
you
would
say
don
t
think
there
is
any
harm
in
them
do
you
know
what
i
mean
david
looked
up
in
quite
genuine
bewilderment
no
sir
he
said
thank
god
for
it
then
said
the
head
then
he
moved
across
the
room
to
his
cabinet
of
cigars
and
broke
his
own
rule
for
he
took
one
out
and
lit
it
and
smoked
it
in
silence
for
a
moment
in
the
sacred
presence
of
one
of
the
boys
then
he
turned
to
david
again
you
don
t
understand
me
now
he
said
but
you
will
and
when
you
do
understand
try
to
remember
for
my
sake
if
that
is
anything
to
you
or
for
your
own
sake
which
certainly
is
or
for
god
s
sake
which
is
best
of
all
that
there
are
worse
things
than
stealing
things
that
damn
the
soul
david
and
now
forget
all
i
have
said
till
the
time
comes
for
you
to
remember
it
you
will
know
when
it
comes
and
don
t
listen
to
any
arguments
about
it
there
is
no
argument
yes
sir
said
david
blankly
he
could
not
understand
why
it
was
the
head
had
thanked
god
but
there
was
no
time
for
wonder
for
instantly
the
head
s
whole
gravity
and
seriousness
vanished
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
he
said
and
i
feel
sure
you
won
t
forget
it
now
when
does
the
old
boys
match
begin
twelve
isn
t
it
i
hope
you
ll
be
in
form
with
your
bowling
we
haven
t
beaten
the
old
boys
for
six
years
but
i
don
t
think
we
ve
ever
had
such
a
good
chance
as
we
have
the
wicket
ought
to
suit
you
if
the
sun
comes
gradually
the
sense
of
this
dawned
on
david
its
tremendous
import
he
flushed
with
incredulous
pride
oh
but
fellows
like
hughes
will
hit
me
all
round
the
clock
sir
he
said
they
will
if
you
think
they
are
going
to
remarked
the
head
that
s
all
then
david
hughes
is
staying
with
me
over
the
night
you
ll
sup
with
yes
sir
thank
you
sir
said
david
in
spite
of
his
failure
to
win
a
scholarship
david
walked
on
air
as
he
went
back
to
the
packing
of
his
for
far
more
important
from
his
own
point
of
view
than
the
getting
of
a
scholarship
was
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
adams
s
for
a
minute
he
wondered
about
what
the
head
had
said
concerning
things
that
were
worse
than
stealing
but
having
been
told
to
forget
all
about
it
instantly
proceeded
to
put
the
question
out
of
his
mind
in
favour
of
more
agreeable
topics
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
head
implied
that
it
was
he
who
might
win
the
old
boys
match
for
the
school
jolly
decent
of
him
considering
that
it
was
he
who
had
certainly
lost
the
eagles
match
for
them
soon
after
the
great
men
from
eton
and
harrow
and
marchester
began
to
arrive
and
each
appeared
more
enormous
than
the
last
however
there
was
no
baleful
father
to
trouble
david
s
peace
and
in
the
before
the
match
began
he
went
and
bowled
to
hughes
at
the
nets
who
incontinently
hit
him
three
times
running
out
of
the
field
but
david
had
the
true
temper
of
the
slow
bowler
who
expects
to
be
hit
while
he
studies
the
hitter
and
observed
that
hughes
was
not
nearly
so
comfortable
with
a
slightly
faster
ball
pitched
a
little
outside
the
leg
stump
and
if
luck
accompanied
the
intention
breaking
in
he
quite
mistimed
two
that
david
sent
down
upon
which
having
got
this
valuable
hint
david
bowled
no
more
of
that
variety
lest
hughes
should
get
used
to
them
then
as
there
were
plenty
of
bowlers
at
hughes
s
net
he
went
on
to
the
next
where
cookson
who
had
left
two
years
before
was
batting
there
again
the
wily
david
tried
the
ball
which
hughes
did
not
care
about
but
found
that
cookson
had
a
special
affection
for
it
and
hit
it
juicily
to
square
leg
but
he
was
less
confident
with
a
very
slow
ball
such
as
hughes
had
hit
so
contemptuously
so
here
was
a
second
bit
of
information
david
committed
that
to
memory
and
tried
a
third
net
where
he
had
no
success
of
any
sort
or
kind
there
had
been
six
school
matches
before
this
stone
had
lost
the
toss
on
five
occasions
and
on
the
sixth
when
he
had
won
had
put
the
other
side
in
with
disastrous
results
however
having
contrary
to
all
expectation
won
the
toss
he
took
the
innings
and
by
six
wickets
were
down
for
a
hundred
and
three
while
cookson
the
only
bowler
of
any
real
merit
was
losing
his
sting
and
david
in
the
last
over
before
lunch
had
hit
him
impertinently
for
twelve
thus
bringing
his
own
contribution
up
to
twenty
during
lunch
he
made
a
beautiful
plan
that
he
would
really
go
in
for
hitting
hard
afterwards
but
this
miscarried
and
he
lost
his
wicket
off
the
first
ball
he
received
owing
to
his
hitting
hard
at
it
at
the
moment
when
his
bails
were
already
whizzing
like
driven
partridges
through
the
air
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
the
innings
closed
for
a
hundred
and
a
total
which
might
have
easily
been
worse
but
undeniably
should
have
been
better
david
s
heart
sank
when
he
saw
two
immense
figures
coming
out
of
the
pavilion
to
open
the
innings
of
the
old
boys
and
found
that
he
had
to
begin
bowling
to
one
with
a
moustache
and
a
forearm
that
seemed
about
as
big
as
his
own
leg
but
as
the
head
had
augured
might
happen
the
sun
had
come
out
during
and
this
after
the
rain
of
the
night
before
which
had
rendered
the
wicket
easy
this
morning
might
render
it
very
difficult
and
also
very
suitable
for
his
mode
of
attack
during
the
afternoon
without
doubt
the
turf
would
cake
and
a
ball
if
judiciously
handled
might
do
very
odd
things
indeed
he
felt
as
if
the
head
had
ordered
the
sun
on
purpose
for
him
which
was
a
kind
thought
and
suddenly
glowing
with
optimism
again
pranced
up
to
the
crease
with
his
usual
extravagant
action
and
was
immediately
hit
clean
out
of
the
ground
the
head
had
appeared
in
front
of
the
pavilion
just
in
time
to
see
this
done
and
david
candidly
reflected
that
it
was
worth
seeing
it
didn
t
often
happen
that
the
first
ball
of
an
innings
was
slogged
for
six
juicy
hit
too
david
approached
the
crease
again
in
a
much
more
staid
manner
and
delivered
a
second
ball
exactly
like
the
first
there
was
really
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
been
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
but
the
giant
carefully
blocked
it
instead
for
it
looked
different
that
thoroughly
pleased
david
he
was
creating
an
atmosphere
he
did
not
use
that
phrase
to
himself
he
merely
thought
that
the
batsman
suspected
something
again
he
altered
his
action
and
took
hardly
any
run
at
all
but
this
time
he
delivered
the
slightly
faster
ball
which
had
puzzled
hughes
during
the
practice
at
the
nets
and
it
was
feebly
returned
straight
into
his
hands
where
it
remained
till
he
buzzed
it
vertically
into
the
air
gosh
i
m
devilish
deep
said
david
to
himself
in
a
spasm
of
odious
pride
by
six
it
was
all
over
helmsworth
had
won
by
twenty
runs
and
david
had
taken
eight
wickets
and
though
since
his
return
from
marchester
he
had
often
told
himself
that
this
was
only
a
scuggy
little
private
school
this
was
a
moment
worth
living
for
for
not
only
did
the
scuggy
little
private
school
roar
at
him
as
he
came
to
the
pavilion
with
the
rest
of
the
team
but
the
disgraced
and
vanquished
giants
of
public
schools
people
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
came
out
shouting
well
bowled
blaize
with
the
most
generous
appreciation
the
head
was
there
too
clapping
his
hands
and
goggles
was
there
beaming
through
her
large
round
spectacles
and
carrots
with
her
hair
shining
in
the
sun
they
were
all
there
david
came
up
the
steps
to
the
pavilion
all
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
eleven
suddenly
stood
away
from
him
and
shoved
him
forward
crimson
in
the
face
with
exertion
and
joy
oh
twasn
t
me
sir
he
said
to
the
head
who
patted
his
shoulder
it
was
just
the
ground
it
played
awfully
and
he
buried
his
delightful
confusion
in
a
quart
of
lemonade
so
in
delicious
triumph
the
last
hours
of
david
s
passed
and
from
the
train
next
morning
he
saw
between
the
trees
the
fleeting
glances
of
the
roofs
which
for
three
years
had
been
his
home
chapter
vii
david
s
father
lived
in
a
grey
rambling
house
in
the
close
at
baxminster
a
plan
of
his
that
as
far
as
david
went
had
something
to
be
said
both
for
and
against
it
in
its
favour
was
the
fact
that
the
house
contained
a
whole
of
dusky
and
mysterious
attics
roofed
in
the
dimness
by
cobwebby
beams
and
used
only
for
and
cisterns
here
it
had
been
delightful
in
years
gone
by
to
find
pleasing
terrors
in
these
dark
and
doubtful
corners
amid
the
gurgles
of
here
he
and
his
sister
in
those
years
gone
by
or
in
other
words
until
a
few
months
ago
had
often
passed
entrancing
wet
afternoons
daring
each
other
particularly
at
the
closing
in
of
dusk
to
explore
the
farthest
recesses
even
to
that
last
attic
of
all
which
contained
a
large
box
and
a
cistern
that
unexpectedly
gave
sudden
and
mirthless
to
itself
most
harrowing
to
nerves
already
keenly
on
edge
the
rules
generally
in
force
were
that
one
of
them
had
to
go
and
sit
alone
in
that
very
spooky
chamber
with
face
turned
honestly
away
from
the
door
while
the
other
dressed
up
in
any
horrific
garb
that
might
suggest
itself
to
a
fevered
imagination
and
having
stealthily
entered
frightened
the
watcher
with
this
hideous
apparition
accompanying
it
by
any
such
noise
of
screaming
or
groaning
that
might
appear
suitable
with
the
victim
looking
steadily
away
from
the
door
these
noises
might
go
on
like
an
artillery
attack
until
his
nerves
were
thoroughly
shaken
though
he
had
not
yet
seen
what
the
apparition
was
to
be
david
had
once
frightened
margery
into
hysterics
here
having
entered
the
room
in
silence
swathed
in
a
sheet
and
wriggling
along
the
floor
he
had
coloured
his
face
purple
from
margery
s
and
having
serpentined
along
till
he
was
in
front
of
her
suddenly
yelled
and
disclosed
the
horrors
of
that
apoplectic
countenance
on
that
occasion
the
gurgling
cistern
had
been
useful
for
he
swiftly
washed
his
own
face
to
reassure
her
but
by
a
variation
of
the
rules
it
having
been
ordained
that
the
frightener
should
enter
the
room
first
and
get
himself
up
to
receive
the
frightened
on
entry
margery
had
got
back
her
own
again
for
she
had
chalked
her
face
and
put
her
tongue
out
and
lain
down
in
the
box
closing
the
lid
as
usual
david
had
looked
for
her
with
quaking
tremors
behind
the
cistern
and
found
her
not
he
had
peered
into
the
darkest
of
all
corners
where
an
empty
bookcase
concealed
a
dangerous
recess
when
suddenly
the
lid
of
the
which
he
had
not
suspected
flew
open
disclosing
margery
lying
quite
still
with
white
face
and
protruding
tongue
david
had
run
as
far
as
the
before
he
could
master
the
panic
of
his
legs
clearly
then
there
was
or
rather
had
been
advantages
in
this
house
but
as
margery
and
david
sat
idly
beneath
the
in
the
garden
from
which
every
now
and
then
a
fat
fruit
plopped
on
to
the
grass
david
announced
that
there
was
no
more
savour
in
these
childish
things
margery
was
a
year
older
than
he
but
being
a
girl
and
already
turned
fifteen
and
he
a
boy
who
had
but
last
week
celebrated
his
fourteenth
birthday
his
father
had
given
him
a
copy
of
the
christian
year
for
which
he
had
very
little
use
she
was
essentially
some
five
years
his
senior
and
knew
how
david
felt
yes
it
used
to
be
ripping
he
said
discontentedly
in
allusion
to
those
years
and
i
used
to
be
awfully
excited
but
i
don
t
care
now
you
see
the
point
was
that
we
frightened
that
was
the
ripping
part
of
it
besides
you
know
if
any
of
the
fellows
at
adams
s
asked
me
what
sort
of
games
we
played
at
home
it
would
be
sickening
to
have
to
say
that
we
just
hid
behind
boxes
in
a
frowsty
attic
tain
t
no
use
any
more
so
what
are
we
to
do
all
this
afternoon
and
and
the
next
day
it
s
funny
that
you
can
t
suggest
something
margery
gave
a
long
sigh
and
ate
one
of
the
fallen
mulberries
she
would
have
given
anything
to
be
able
to
suggest
something
else
in
appearance
she
was
so
like
david
that
if
brother
and
sister
had
dressed
in
the
other
s
clothes
and
corrected
the
discrepancy
of
hair
and
broken
front
tooth
either
might
have
passed
a
frontier
with
the
passport
of
the
other
well
i
ve
suggested
heaps
of
things
and
you
say
they
are
all
rot
she
said
i
ll
play
anything
you
like
we
used
to
have
rather
fun
playing
cricket
wouldn
t
you
like
to
play
cricket
oh
what
s
the
use
said
david
i
should
hit
you
into
the
deanery
garden
all
afternoon
and
always
bowl
you
first
ball
i
took
eight
wickets
margery
had
a
good
deal
of
david
s
spirit
as
well
as
his
bodily
aspect
i
know
you
told
me
that
she
said
david
had
a
certain
sense
of
being
common
to
his
sex
at
his
age
oh
all
right
he
said
with
dignity
but
you
to
be
interested
in
my
margery
had
probably
never
heard
of
women
s
rights
she
only
knew
that
her
beloved
david
was
rather
unfair
sometimes
on
these
occasions
she
never
by
any
chance
took
refuge
in
pathos
silly
gubbins
she
said
you
told
me
twice
and
i
was
interested
even
the
second
time
david
do
buck
up
go
and
smoke
a
cigarette
won
t
you
it
s
quite
disgusting
of
you
to
smoke
and
some
day
father
will
smell
it
and
there
ll
be
trouble
but
it
used
to
make
you
given
up
smoking
said
david
morosely
ages
hurrah
did
it
make
you
feel
unwell
no
you
ass
but
it
s
scuggish
to
smoke
only
scugs
smoke
at
margery
nodded
at
him
approvingly
i
always
told
you
you
would
cease
to
think
it
grand
when
you
got
with
nice
boys
she
said
oh
shut
up
said
david
margery
melted
completely
under
this
she
felt
that
he
was
only
a
little
boy
in
spite
of
all
the
wickets
he
had
taken
and
that
she
was
a
woman
instinctively
she
took
up
the
glory
and
burden
of
her
sex
oh
david
what
s
the
matter
she
said
i
am
sorry
you
feel
beastly
what
is
it
david
slid
off
his
chair
and
lay
down
flat
on
the
grass
staring
up
into
the
thick
green
leaves
chinked
with
blue
sky
almost
immediately
a
ripe
mulberry
dropped
on
his
nose
and
burst
and
though
it
was
immensely
funny
margery
continued
quite
grave
david
said
damn
and
solemnly
wiped
it
off
then
she
sat
down
on
the
grass
by
him
what
is
the
matter
david
she
repeated
david
blew
away
a
fly
that
wished
to
settle
on
his
face
oh
it
s
so
dull
he
said
i
am
so
bored
and
fancy
being
stuck
here
all
august
as
father
s
in
residence
you
re
a
ripper
all
right
but
then
you
re
a
girl
i
expect
you
can
t
help
i
ll
come
and
play
cricket
if
you
i
don
t
said
margery
go
i
don
t
suppose
you
would
understand
said
the
superior
sex
but
you
see
i
ve
got
to
start
again
it
s
scuggish
to
smoke
or
to
keep
and
i
shan
t
see
any
of
the
chaps
i
was
friends
with
again
and
some
of
them
were
jolly
decent
in
spite
of
what
you
say
about
smoking
except
bags
it
s
it
s
like
emigrating
of
course
it
s
perfectly
ripping
going
to
marchester
but
oh
well
i
feel
rotten
this
oh
is
bags
going
to
marchester
asked
margery
yes
i
heard
from
him
this
morning
he
s
going
to
adams
s
david
s
tone
was
not
that
of
one
who
finds
a
consoling
circumstance
and
margery
felt
her
way
but
you
re
tremendous
friends
with
him
aren
t
you
she
asked
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
he
was
jolly
decent
to
me
last
half
when
a
lot
of
the
fellows
were
against
me
but
he
doesn
t
play
games
you
know
and
has
got
a
weak
heart
and
he
s
rather
an
ass
in
some
ways
and
he
says
he
has
persuaded
his
governor
to
let
him
go
to
marchester
just
because
of
well
then
he
s
very
fond
of
you
said
margery
i
know
he
is
that
makes
me
feel
rather
a
cad
of
course
it
ll
be
awfully
nice
to
have
bags
there
and
all
that
but
oh
i
can
t
explain
and
you
can
t
but
margery
being
a
child
herself
could
completely
understand
the
unfathomable
mind
of
childhood
i
shouldn
t
worry
about
that
david
she
said
even
if
bags
can
t
play
cricket
perhaps
you
ll
find
he
can
do
something
else
that
ll
make
him
all
david
regarded
the
roof
of
severely
well
i
suppose
i
ve
just
got
the
hump
he
said
i
don
t
care
for
the
old
things
and
i
haven
t
got
any
new
ones
yet
look
at
these
holidays
i
hate
cathedrals
and
we
re
going
to
stop
here
all
august
i
don
t
want
to
grub
in
the
attics
any
more
or
to
play
pirates
and
there
s
no
cricket
except
one
match
against
those
rotten
little
choirboys
and
father
talks
the
most
awful
tosh
about
cricket
says
he
never
wore
pads
when
he
was
a
dare
say
they
weren
t
anyhow
he
could
never
have
played
for
nuts
i
can
t
argue
with
him
it
isn
t
any
use
because
he
doesn
t
know
david
sat
up
in
a
despair
of
indignation
only
the
other
day
he
said
at
the
county
match
he
asked
me
where
jessop
was
fielding
so
of
course
i
said
at
which
he
was
and
father
said
it
wasn
t
perhaps
it
was
there
wasn
t
a
perhaps
in
the
whole
blooming
show
why
even
you
know
that
that
makes
it
so
unfair
if
father
tells
me
that
ornament
comes
in
norman
architecture
i
don
t
say
the
wise
margery
continued
her
course
of
consolation
oh
but
david
she
said
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
like
besides
cricket
there
s
that
ripping
poem
you
read
me
the
other
day
keats
s
ode
to
the
i
loved
it
was
he
head
master
of
eton
david
wiped
the
final
remains
of
the
burst
mulberry
from
his
face
in
a
magisterial
manner
head
master
of
eton
he
said
why
he
was
in
a
sort
of
doctor
s
shop
where
you
might
have
got
something
for
the
head
said
and
all
the
time
he
was
writing
that
ode
isn
t
it
rummy
the
boy
is
father
to
the
man
so
also
is
the
girl
to
the
woman
margery
with
secret
glee
saw
that
david
was
feeling
better
and
inclined
to
be
interested
yes
you
did
tell
me
she
said
penitently
but
i
forgot
sorry
oh
that
s
all
right
i
forget
lots
of
things
i
say
it
s
an
awful
pity
you
re
a
girl
margery
you
would
have
been
such
a
ripping
i
dare
say
i
should
have
got
on
all
right
said
she
or
perhaps
you
might
have
been
a
me
a
girl
said
david
but
i
couldn
t
think
of
the
things
girls
have
to
do
it
s
margery
felt
she
must
stand
up
for
her
sex
i
don
t
see
that
the
things
we
have
to
do
are
more
ridiculous
than
your
smoking
or
keeping
those
beastly
said
she
for
she
shared
bags
s
horror
of
that
which
crawled
david
got
up
with
extraordinary
dignity
those
are
the
things
i
told
you
in
confidence
he
said
well
and
whom
have
i
told
demanded
margery
besides
they
re
all
finished
said
david
you
shouldn
t
bring
them
up
against
i
didn
t
i
was
only
then
let
s
stop
arguing
said
david
lord
it
s
only
just
three
there
s
that
beastly
cathedral
clock
striking
i
suppose
that
s
norman
too
isn
t
it
what
are
we
to
do
margery
made
a
little
sympathetic
grimace
at
david
oh
david
i
do
understand
she
said
and
i
m
so
sorry
you
re
bored
i
know
exactly
what
s
the
matter
with
wish
you
d
tell
me
said
david
you
know
too
really
you
ve
dropped
one
lot
of
things
and
haven
t
got
the
next
lot
yet
then
there
s
this
do
you
remember
that
green
snake
you
used
to
keep
and
how
when
it
was
changing
its
skin
it
used
to
lie
quite
still
not
eating
or
drinking
and
seeming
awfully
depressed
i
expect
that
sort
of
thing
is
happening
to
you
i
shouldn
t
a
bit
wonder
if
our
minds
changed
their
skins
now
and
then
just
like
david
was
interested
in
this
but
it
was
necessary
in
his
present
humour
to
be
rather
depreciatory
girls
do
have
such
rum
notions
he
said
i
can
t
think
where
you
get
them
from
but
what
then
just
that
you
have
been
a
little
boy
up
till
now
although
you
were
no
end
of
a
swell
at
helmsworth
and
you
re
just
beginning
to
see
it
you
know
you
would
have
been
furious
with
me
if
i
had
told
you
even
only
last
holidays
that
you
were
only
a
little
boy
but
you
don
t
mind
now
because
you
know
it
yourself
you
re
changing
your
skin
i
forget
that
word
of
yours
the
marchester
piffle
suggested
david
yes
what
piffle
you
would
have
thought
the
keats
ode
only
a
few
months
ago
and
at
that
time
you
thought
it
grand
and
to
david
sat
down
again
thoroughly
interested
in
his
own
metamorphosis
yes
that
s
rum
he
said
no
not
really
it
s
just
growing
it
sounds
sort
of
philosophical
said
he
margery
picked
up
two
or
three
fallen
mulberries
and
put
them
into
her
mouth
absently
one
after
the
other
i
dare
say
she
said
oh
david
do
be
quick
about
changing
your
skin
and
let
me
see
the
new
one
and
now
let
s
go
and
do
something
i
vote
we
go
and
look
at
that
old
bookstall
by
the
priory
gate
we
might
find
a
keats
among
the
cheap
lots
in
the
tray
you
asked
me
to
come
and
look
for
one
this
she
held
out
her
hands
to
her
brother
and
he
pulled
her
up
right
oh
he
said
i
say
margery
you
re
not
a
bad
and
margery
was
extremely
content
the
garden
where
they
had
been
sitting
was
one
of
peculiar
charm
though
to
david
it
ranked
rather
high
among
the
disadvantages
of
the
place
for
the
lawn
was
not
big
enough
to
play
any
game
into
which
hitting
hard
or
kicking
hard
entered
and
as
that
was
the
paramount
requirement
demanded
of
pieces
of
grass
there
was
really
very
little
to
be
said
in
favour
of
this
garden
balls
always
went
into
bushes
or
it
was
a
very
arena
the
house
itself
rambling
and
lay
between
it
and
the
road
that
circled
round
the
close
and
to
north
and
south
the
garden
on
its
longer
sides
was
bounded
by
which
centuries
of
sun
and
wintry
weather
had
mellowed
to
an
inimitable
softness
of
hue
below
the
wall
a
deep
the
grave
of
many
balls
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
grass
which
on
the
other
side
came
up
to
the
wall
flush
as
a
carpet
to
a
wainscotting
a
few
sunned
themselves
below
the
low
stone
terrace
that
bordered
the
house
but
the
most
distressing
thing
from
david
s
standpoint
was
that
this
kindly
propped
and
strutted
like
a
very
old
man
taking
the
air
stood
bang
in
the
centre
of
the
lawn
so
that
was
out
of
the
question
along
the
far
end
of
the
garden
was
a
collection
of
sculptured
stones
roman
or
something
beastly
was
his
verdict
there
probably
unearthed
when
the
garden
was
first
made
here
a
gate
in
the
middle
of
the
third
led
into
the
which
of
course
from
the
orthodox
athletic
view
of
gardens
was
also
quite
futile
but
to
the
unorthodox
nothing
could
have
been
more
charming
the
were
starred
with
and
wallflower
and
over
the
roof
of
the
house
rose
the
norman
tower
of
the
cathedral
grave
and
gracious
against
the
sky
the
care
of
the
had
lately
been
given
into
margery
s
hands
who
had
adopted
radical
measures
against
the
dreadful
rows
of
geraniums
calceolarias
and
lobelias
with
which
the
gardener
had
been
accustomed
to
make
gay
the
long
border
and
she
had
gone
back
to
happier
stood
in
clumps
like
stooks
of
flowering
corn
pansies
and
heliotrope
and
were
lowlier
citizens
and
behind
hollyhocks
and
sunflowers
kept
sentinel
and
over
all
pervasive
and
mellow
as
the
august
sunshine
brooded
that
atmosphere
of
studious
serenity
which
belongs
to
such
ancient
homes
of
peace
as
cathedrals
and
monastic
places
but
√¶sthetic
as
such
an
atmosphere
is
it
is
not
greatly
appreciated
by
the
young
nor
indeed
is
there
the
smallest
reason
why
it
should
be
everybody
and
everything
such
was
david
s
view
was
old
here
and
for
some
inscrutable
reason
age
was
considered
an
advantage
an
old
bishop
lived
in
an
old
palace
and
the
venerableness
of
both
appeared
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
close
to
be
equally
admirable
elderly
rooks
at
least
they
talked
in
an
elderly
and
boring
way
cawed
in
immemorial
elms
roman
remains
were
constantly
being
dug
up
and
put
in
the
museum
or
if
not
worthy
of
that
fate
carefully
grouped
as
here
into
the
form
of
an
outrageous
rockery
and
now
for
seven
weeks
since
this
year
the
archdeacon
was
in
residence
in
august
and
september
the
monotony
of
six
deadly
was
only
to
be
broken
by
the
even
deadlier
monotony
of
sunday
such
was
the
pessimistic
outlook
over
life
that
david
took
and
since
pessimism
was
of
uncommonly
infrequent
occurrence
with
him
it
was
more
than
possible
that
margery
s
reference
of
it
to
was
a
correct
one
this
sort
of
philosophical
explanation
on
her
part
had
already
done
something
towards
restoring
him
to
more
normal
levels
and
the
inspection
of
the
boxes
of
books
outside
the
window
of
the
shop
with
the
events
that
followed
completed
the
process
for
there
by
the
most
apt
dispensation
of
providence
they
found
margery
actually
found
it
and
instantly
passed
it
on
to
david
a
rather
battered
and
copy
of
keats
this
was
a
triumphant
affair
showing
that
good
could
come
even
out
of
baxminster
and
they
hurried
inside
to
complete
the
sixpenny
purchase
coming
out
again
into
the
street
they
saw
outside
a
figure
turning
over
the
boxes
they
had
just
left
and
suddenly
david
s
heart
leaped
for
he
saw
that
the
colours
on
it
were
those
of
adams
s
house
the
moment
upon
wonder
saw
who
it
was
maddox
turned
round
as
they
came
out
and
frowned
for
a
second
wondering
where
he
had
seen
david
before
then
he
remembered
you
re
topknot
s
pal
aren
t
you
he
said
then
he
saw
that
david
was
with
a
girl
i
beg
your
pardon
he
added
quickly
raising
the
enviable
hat
david
took
his
courage
in
his
hands
probably
it
was
awful
cheek
but
after
all
it
was
in
the
holidays
and
they
were
not
at
school
oh
this
is
my
sister
he
said
margery
this
is
maddox
shook
hands
and
turned
to
david
again
do
tell
me
your
name
he
said
for
the
only
piece
of
it
i
can
remember
is
you
came
down
to
try
for
a
scholarship
and
stayed
at
adams
it
seemed
wonderful
to
david
that
anybody
so
great
should
remember
anything
blaize
he
said
of
course
and
so
you
and
david
live
here
miss
blaize
in
this
ripping
town
i
never
saw
such
a
jolly
place
i
could
prowl
about
the
close
and
the
cathedral
for
yes
my
pater
s
archdeacon
said
david
i
wish
mine
was
said
maddox
but
i
ve
got
some
right
here
i
came
down
two
days
ago
to
stay
with
my
uncle
who
s
bishop
i
expect
you
know
him
don
t
you
he
s
got
one
of
those
gorgeous
houses
in
the
david
again
made
a
stupendous
call
on
his
courage
i
say
won
t
you
come
to
tea
he
blurted
out
if
you
like
these
houses
in
the
close
we
live
in
one
you
know
margy
do
ask
david
and
i
would
like
it
awfully
if
you
would
come
she
said
maddox
laughed
and
he
tilted
his
head
back
a
little
as
he
laughed
and
on
the
moment
that
appeared
to
david
the
only
possible
way
to
laugh
thank
you
very
much
he
said
we
should
all
three
like
it
awfully
then
so
why
shouldn
t
we
do
it
but
may
i
just
look
through
this
box
i
love
looking
through
old
you
never
know
what
you
mayn
t
find
though
personally
i
never
find
anything
but
volumes
of
antique
sermons
printed
by
request
of
a
few
friends
have
you
been
buying
something
yes
but
only
an
old
keats
said
david
holding
it
out
to
him
maddox
looked
at
the
which
was
intact
and
his
eyes
grew
round
my
goodness
you
lucky
beggar
he
said
and
you
bought
it
just
this
minute
yes
why
only
because
it
s
a
book
that
a
would
give
a
lot
for
second
edition
of
keats
that
s
all
o
lord
if
i
hadn
t
sat
down
doing
nothing
after
lunch
instead
of
coming
here
oh
i
say
please
take
it
then
said
david
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
i
just
thought
i
would
like
a
keats
any
other
one
would
be
all
the
same
to
maddox
looked
at
him
gravely
a
moment
and
then
began
to
smile
thanks
very
much
he
said
and
i
will
then
sell
it
you
if
you
like
for
ten
then
he
laughed
again
i
m
a
greedy
brute
he
said
but
there
are
limits
take
it
back
quick
or
it
will
grow
on
to
my
fingers
you
are
a
lucky
ten
pounds
said
david
incredulously
i
should
think
about
that
but
i
don
t
really
know
i
m
not
in
the
habit
of
buying
second
editions
of
keats
let
s
look
again
a
minute
i
ll
try
to
give
it
you
back
yes
it
s
quite
suddenly
david
remembered
that
the
find
was
not
his
but
margery
s
i
bang
forgot
he
said
margery
you
found
it
for
a
moment
his
face
grew
troubled
and
i
offered
it
you
not
remembering
he
said
to
maddox
i
really
did
mean
it
do
take
it
margery
you
understand
don
t
you
maddox
laid
his
hand
on
david
s
shoulder
and
looked
at
him
it
s
quite
ripping
of
you
david
he
said
and
at
that
moment
david
loved
his
christian
name
but
whether
it
s
your
sister
s
or
yours
i
couldn
t
possibly
but
thanks
most
but
are
you
sure
asked
david
he
laughed
why
of
course
i
am
what
do
you
take
me
for
oh
i
can
t
bother
about
these
beastly
books
now
i
know
what
s
come
out
of
that
tray
shall
we
go
then
but
on
the
way
the
question
of
the
rightful
possessor
of
this
treasure
had
to
be
laid
before
him
margery
s
contention
was
that
david
had
suggested
going
to
see
if
they
could
find
a
keats
and
that
she
had
merely
accompanied
him
and
therefore
the
book
was
his
david
on
the
other
hand
had
contended
that
she
had
found
it
and
you
couldn
t
get
over
that
they
both
referred
the
decision
to
maddox
with
his
seventeen
years
experience
of
the
world
depends
on
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
it
he
said
if
you
mean
to
sell
it
i
really
think
i
should
divide
the
proceeds
if
i
should
have
a
box
made
for
it
with
two
keys
one
for
each
of
you
anyhow
i
shouldn
t
suggest
the
and
cut
it
in
half
the
immenseness
of
all
this
momentarily
obscured
the
honour
and
glory
of
taking
maddox
home
to
tea
and
the
fate
of
the
keats
was
warmly
debated
david
was
rather
inclined
to
sell
it
and
revel
in
gold
but
margery
hinted
that
if
they
were
each
possessed
of
five
pounds
it
certainly
would
not
be
they
who
revelled
in
gold
but
the
before
the
question
was
settled
they
had
got
back
to
the
close
and
david
pointed
out
his
father
s
house
a
little
way
ahead
of
them
maddox
clicked
his
teeth
with
his
tongue
in
a
show
of
impatience
this
is
rather
too
much
he
said
you
find
a
second
edition
of
keats
and
bring
it
home
to
the
most
beautiful
house
in
baxminster
i
call
it
rotten
may
i
see
all
over
it
before
tea
and
the
garden
david
felt
he
must
apologise
for
the
garden
oh
the
garden
s
an
awful
hole
he
said
though
margery
doesn
t
think
so
there
s
no
room
for
anything
as
you
ll
so
the
fairy
prince
was
led
in
and
taken
all
over
the
house
and
as
they
went
merits
and
glories
undreamed
of
dawned
on
david
what
had
been
dark
ugly
wood
turned
out
to
be
jacobean
panelling
and
a
frowsy
old
picture
of
david
s
in
a
was
pronounced
the
most
ripping
romney
who
in
his
line
appeared
to
be
up
to
the
high
standard
already
set
by
keats
and
most
astounding
of
all
was
maddox
s
verdict
on
the
attics
which
david
had
abandoned
as
a
proper
playground
for
anybody
who
was
going
to
marchester
in
september
but
the
fairy
prince
thought
otherwise
what
awful
fun
you
could
have
playing
horrible
games
like
hide
and
seek
up
here
he
said
i
hope
you
do
lord
what
s
that
groan
oh
a
cistern
is
it
i
thought
it
must
be
a
ghost
how
ripping
david
instantly
dismissed
his
resolution
of
not
playing
games
here
any
more
oh
there
s
a
worse
room
yet
he
said
do
come
and
look
at
it
there
s
a
box
like
a
coffin
in
it
margery
and
i
used
to
play
gorgeous
games
up
here
dressing
up
and
frightening
each
other
you
know
wasn
t
it
fun
margery
margery
was
the
soul
of
loyalty
she
would
no
more
have
reminded
david
that
only
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
these
games
were
silly
than
she
would
have
had
him
led
out
to
instant
execution
yes
when
it
begins
to
get
dark
it
s
awful
up
here
she
said
you
can
t
see
anything
distinctly
and
the
cistern
suddenly
groans
and
you
can
t
tell
what
s
coming
next
maddox
in
spite
of
his
seventeen
years
and
olympian
elevation
did
not
seem
to
be
unbending
david
in
fact
if
his
utterances
this
afternoon
were
to
be
taken
literally
had
to
unbend
to
him
i
love
being
frightened
said
maddox
you
ought
to
read
ghost
stories
to
each
other
here
and
the
one
who
reads
may
make
any
sort
of
noise
he
chooses
at
any
moment
just
when
the
ghost
is
going
to
appear
you
know
lord
i
hope
i
shall
never
get
beyond
that
sort
of
thing
he
margery
and
david
were
standing
in
a
row
opposite
the
box
just
then
the
cistern
in
the
room
behind
gave
one
of
its
best
and
maddox
looked
awfully
round
oh
what
s
that
he
said
that
s
not
the
cistern
that
s
a
man
bleeding
to
death
in
there
that
is
his
throat
s
cut
from
ear
to
no
said
david
i
m
sure
it
was
the
are
you
it
may
have
been
the
cistern
before
but
i
don
t
believe
it
was
that
time
pity
it
s
not
a
little
darker
there
s
too
much
light
really
just
already
to
david
the
attic
bristled
again
with
entrancing
possibilities
under
this
stimulus
it
was
queer
that
any
one
of
maddox
s
age
and
attainments
should
see
sport
in
what
a
few
hours
ago
had
seemed
childish
and
savourless
to
himself
but
since
this
was
so
it
was
clear
there
must
be
something
in
it
but
made
him
see
through
his
hero
s
eyes
and
all
that
maddox
did
or
said
was
invested
with
authority
true
he
had
seen
him
perhaps
half
a
dozen
times
altogether
but
that
was
quite
sufficient
to
make
this
matchless
glamour
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
one
so
instinct
with
romance
and
glory
as
this
boy
three
years
his
senior
who
realised
for
him
all
he
wanted
to
be
of
course
they
went
downstairs
again
on
the
pronouncement
that
it
was
not
dark
enough
i
m
afraid
you
ll
think
the
garden
is
rot
said
david
there
s
a
beastly
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
but
it
s
not
so
bad
to
have
tea
in
margery
can
t
we
have
tea
out
there
so
the
fairy
prince
was
escorted
downstairs
and
out
into
the
garden
to
give
his
verdict
on
that
despised
spot
and
looked
round
with
those
quick
movements
of
his
eye
from
side
to
side
without
turning
his
head
which
again
seemed
now
the
only
possible
way
of
looking
at
things
but
what
on
earth
good
enough
for
you
david
he
said
you
can
t
read
keats
except
out
of
a
second
edition
and
you
told
me
the
attics
were
rather
fun
once
and
you
say
the
garden
is
rotten
look
at
those
brick
walls
look
at
the
house
look
at
the
oh
i
say
what
are
those
stones
in
the
corner
isn
t
that
a
roman
altar
yes
i
believe
so
said
david
do
you
care
about
those
things
maddox
and
he
walked
down
to
the
collection
of
old
stones
which
had
appeared
to
david
the
dullest
of
the
antique
things
of
baxminster
some
of
the
lettering
on
one
of
these
was
still
distinguishable
yes
optimo
maximo
said
maddox
i
expect
that
gap
is
then
lower
down
do
you
see
p
aelius
that
must
be
the
chap
who
dedicated
it
funny
that
it
should
stand
here
now
for
you
and
me
to
read
while
the
cathedral
tower
squints
at
us
over
the
attics
where
the
ghosts
maddox
had
seated
himself
on
the
grass
to
examine
the
altar
and
david
leaned
over
him
following
the
letters
as
he
traced
them
with
his
smooth
brown
finger
and
at
once
the
subject
even
of
roman
altars
leaped
into
interest
maddox
shaded
the
lowest
line
of
the
inscription
with
his
hand
to
catch
the
shape
of
the
letters
can
t
read
any
more
he
said
but
anyhow
one
day
long
before
the
cathedral
was
built
publius
aelius
set
that
up
because
the
gods
had
been
good
to
him
what
a
lot
of
jolly
things
there
are
and
some
fellows
go
mooning
along
never
looking
at
i
m
afraid
you
mean
me
suggested
david
modestly
maddox
looked
up
at
him
over
his
shoulder
well
i
don
t
he
said
and
there
s
a
bit
of
an
arch
perhaps
that
came
from
the
temple
where
aelius
put
his
maddox
asked
for
and
was
given
another
look
at
the
keats
before
he
left
and
proposed
to
david
that
he
should
walk
with
him
as
far
as
the
old
palace
best
afternoon
i
ve
spent
for
ages
said
the
idol
as
they
parted
i
wish
i
wasn
t
going
away
or
i
should
ask
to
be
allowed
to
come
again
anyhow
we
meet
at
adams
s
in
a
haunting
doubt
had
been
present
in
david
s
mind
at
intervals
all
that
heavenly
afternoon
now
it
had
to
find
expression
i
say
i
hope
it
hasn
t
been
awful
cheek
of
me
to
have
asked
you
to
have
tea
and
all
that
he
said
i
can
stand
lots
of
that
sort
of
cheek
said
the
other
chapter
viii
it
was
the
afternoon
of
such
a
november
day
as
the
pessimistic
call
typical
a
cold
gale
drove
streaming
flocks
of
huddled
cloud
across
the
sky
like
some
fierce
and
boisterous
shepherd
and
the
whole
of
the
great
court
at
marchester
stood
in
gravelly
pools
of
water
the
gale
had
stripped
bare
of
their
few
remaining
leaves
the
avenue
of
which
ran
between
the
gate
and
the
house
at
the
far
end
of
the
court
and
they
stood
stark
pyramids
of
dripping
branches
and
twigs
that
whistled
as
the
wind
hissed
through
them
though
the
day
was
saturday
and
in
consequence
a
there
were
but
few
signs
of
outdoor
animation
for
the
conditions
of
the
weather
were
sufficiently
diabolical
to
tinge
with
some
touch
of
respect
the
contempt
in
which
healthy
boys
hold
the
vagaries
of
climate
one
occasionally
with
collar
turned
up
fled
splashing
across
the
court
from
one
house
to
another
or
now
and
then
a
small
company
of
drenched
enthusiasts
would
trot
in
in
dripping
shorts
and
sweaters
from
their
training
run
along
the
london
road
or
a
couple
of
figures
with
racquets
protected
under
their
coats
would
dash
across
from
the
but
football
had
been
officially
announced
to
be
off
since
the
field
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
morass
and
without
doubt
the
most
comfortable
conditions
of
life
were
to
be
obtained
in
front
of
a
fire
with
a
novel
to
read
or
under
stress
of
necessity
arrears
of
work
to
be
overhauled
and
demolished
there
was
however
in
one
of
the
open
near
the
porter
s
lodge
a
notable
exception
to
this
indoor
tendency
there
two
boys
capless
and
streaming
with
water
were
absorbingly
engaged
in
playing
squash
a
most
apt
occupation
since
they
and
the
earth
and
the
sky
generally
seemed
to
be
in
a
condition
of
squash
even
in
the
drier
parts
of
the
court
the
ball
as
it
bounced
sent
up
a
squirt
of
water
at
other
times
it
pitched
in
more
definite
puddles
and
so
did
not
bounce
at
all
but
the
two
david
and
bags
were
quite
undeterred
by
such
small
drawbacks
and
david
talked
without
the
least
intermission
six
all
he
said
and
as
i
gave
you
six
i
ve
caught
you
up
before
you
ve
scored
have
some
more
points
won
t
you
very
well
if
you
re
proud
you
needn
t
but
if
i
played
squash
at
all
like
you
i
should
be
damned
humble
o
bags
you
ass
i
don
t
believe
you
ll
ever
be
the
slightest
good
why
can
t
you
hit
the
ball
with
the
middle
of
your
racquet
for
a
change
there
look
at
that
exactly
of
an
inch
above
the
line
i
like
them
like
that
seven
six
oh
good
shot
jolly
well
got
up
but
observe
you
can
t
get
that
so
what
s
the
use
of
throwing
yourself
against
the
wall
eight
six
oh
damn
puts
you
in
six
eight
i
ll
give
you
two
hands
if
you
like
oh
you
ll
take
that
will
you
one
hand
out
then
oh
do
get
on
run
can
t
you
it
s
raining
there
suck
it
you
expected
it
the
other
side
of
the
court
and
that
s
exactly
why
i
didn
t
send
it
there
puts
me
in
i
ll
play
you
for
sixpence
if
you
like
next
game
and
give
you
eight
and
two
hands
no
prudent
fellow
i
wish
the
rain
wouldn
t
get
into
my
eyes
though
it
s
sweat
as
well
i
expect
lord
i
am
hot
isn
t
it
ripping
david
paused
a
moment
both
from
talk
and
athletics
a
truce
gladly
accepted
by
the
panting
bags
and
pushed
his
dripping
hair
out
of
his
eyes
he
was
a
completely
dishevelled
and
yet
a
very
jolly
object
and
was
quite
altogether
wet
his
knickerbockers
clinging
like
tights
to
his
thighs
the
skin
of
which
showed
pink
through
them
while
the
water
trickled
steadily
down
his
bare
calves
into
the
dejected
socks
that
lay
limply
round
the
tops
of
his
shoes
they
and
his
legs
were
stained
with
splashes
of
watery
gravel
his
shirt
open
at
the
neck
and
slightly
torn
across
the
shoulder
lay
like
a
wet
bag
glued
to
his
back
and
his
hair
was
a
mere
yellow
plaster
from
which
the
water
could
have
been
wrung
in
pints
bags
was
in
similar
plight
except
that
he
wore
a
thick
woollen
jersey
over
his
shirt
which
gave
him
a
slightly
less
drowned
aspect
the
game
and
with
it
david
s
running
comments
were
resumed
after
a
minute
or
two
and
neither
of
the
two
saw
a
figure
with
trousers
much
turned
up
and
a
large
golfing
umbrella
who
had
paused
on
his
way
to
the
gate
just
behind
them
yes
i
m
going
to
play
racquets
for
the
school
some
time
next
century
david
was
saying
and
squash
is
jolly
good
practice
nine
six
that
s
rather
a
sell
bags
oh
i
say
look
at
that
for
a
just
a
shade
maddoxy
i
don
t
the
in
question
that
clung
close
to
the
left
wall
of
the
court
finished
the
rally
and
david
turned
to
run
to
pick
it
up
and
found
that
maddox
was
the
spectator
david
you
juggins
why
haven
t
you
got
a
sweater
on
asked
he
hullo
said
david
oh
because
i
couldn
t
find
mine
some
brute
s
collared
it
i
well
by
rights
you
ought
to
get
pneumonia
and
be
prayed
for
in
chapel
and
die
in
spite
of
david
pushed
back
his
hair
again
and
laughed
thanks
awfully
but
otherwise
engaged
he
said
are
you
going
up
to
house
after
you
ve
finished
being
drowned
asked
maddox
no
i
was
going
to
have
tea
with
a
fellow
in
college
said
david
but
i
m
rather
wet
i
m
you
ll
go
up
to
house
and
change
first
do
you
see
said
maddox
and
you
might
bring
up
a
parcel
there
will
be
for
me
at
the
lodge
hasn
t
come
yet
but
it
ll
come
any
right
said
david
the
game
was
resumed
but
maddox
still
lingered
both
boys
played
with
redoubled
keenness
before
so
honourable
a
spectator
but
david
s
artless
and
incessant
conversation
was
felt
by
him
to
be
unsuitable
maddox
watched
in
silence
for
a
minute
no
let
the
ball
drop
more
he
said
bags
having
made
an
egregiously
futile
return
don
t
take
an
easy
ball
like
that
till
it
s
quite
low
david
you
play
with
your
whole
arm
like
a
windmill
whereas
you
only
want
your
wrist
just
keep
flicking
it
look
maddox
gave
david
the
large
umbrella
to
hold
and
taking
his
racquet
knocked
up
down
the
wall
of
the
court
sending
each
ball
parallel
and
close
to
it
with
easy
accuracy
like
that
more
or
less
he
said
now
i
m
wet
blast
you
he
took
his
umbrella
again
reminded
david
of
the
parcel
and
splashed
off
across
the
quadrangle
familiarity
and
closer
acquaintance
had
not
in
the
least
made
david
get
over
the
glory
and
wonder
of
maddox
by
gad
he
said
fancy
his
taking
the
trouble
to
coach
two
scugs
like
you
and
me
isn
t
he
a
ripper
come
on
let
s
have
one
more
oh
i
vote
we
stop
said
bags
it
s
too
wet
for
rot
we
can
t
possibly
get
wetter
than
we
david
of
course
had
his
way
and
it
was
not
till
twenty
minutes
later
that
they
trotted
off
down
the
bath
road
on
their
way
to
adams
s
david
going
by
preference
through
the
larger
puddles
bags
s
mind
and
no
doubt
david
s
also
still
ran
upon
maddox
does
he
always
call
you
david
he
asked
at
length
lord
yes
when
we
re
alone
said
david
and
i
suppose
he
thought
you
didn
t
count
i
remember
how
sick
i
was
when
my
father
called
me
david
at
helmsworth
sort
of
disgrace
to
have
your
christian
name
known
what
beastly
little
scugs
we
were
with
smoking
and
keeping
i
never
did
either
said
bags
in
a
rather
superior
manner
david
jumped
with
both
feet
in
a
particularly
large
puddle
and
covered
bags
with
splashed
water
i
know
you
didn
t
he
said
you
were
such
a
scug
you
see
that
you
didn
t
do
those
things
when
it
was
scuggish
not
to
but
now
when
it
s
scuggish
to
do
them
i
believe
you
do
i
bet
you
smoke
you
and
plugs
went
out
smoking
yesterday
after
well
what
if
i
did
said
bags
and
how
did
you
know
because
i
stunk
you
when
you
came
back
simple
what
a
funny
chap
you
are
you
never
smoked
at
helmsworth
where
it
was
the
right
thing
and
yet
you
do
here
where
it
s
the
wrong
bags
plodded
on
for
a
little
while
in
silence
adams
doesn
t
really
mind
our
smoking
he
said
he
chiefly
wants
not
to
have
it
brought
to
his
yes
but
maddox
does
said
david
i
wish
he
d
catch
you
at
it
you
wouldn
t
sit
comfortable
for
a
week
or
david
pranced
into
the
footpath
there
was
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
mud
that
it
was
convenient
to
carry
on
your
shoes
let
s
walk
a
bit
he
said
i
m
they
moderated
their
pace
to
a
walk
and
david
squeezed
his
hands
into
his
difficult
operation
as
they
were
glued
together
with
wet
several
fellows
have
asked
me
about
maddox
he
said
and
i
don
t
know
that
the
deuce
they
re
after
hughes
has
for
instance
hughes
used
to
be
a
ripper
but
he
s
different
somehow
now
he
asked
me
the
other
day
if
maddox
had
become
a
saint
and
if
i
d
converted
him
what
the
devil
was
he
talking
about
i
don
t
like
hughes
as
much
as
i
used
he
told
some
filthy
tale
in
dormitory
the
other
night
and
some
of
the
fellows
laughed
i
laughed
too
i
supposed
it
was
polite
but
i
didn
t
see
a
hang
what
it
all
what
was
it
asked
bags
god
knows
some
awful
piffle
sounded
filthy
too
he
wanted
to
explain
it
to
me
came
and
sat
on
my
bed
and
wanted
to
explain
but
just
then
maddox
came
to
bed
he
d
been
sitting
up
late
working
and
he
hoofed
hughes
out
again
in
less
than
no
time
it
was
the
day
after
that
that
hughes
asked
me
if
maddox
had
become
a
saint
lord
wait
a
for
some
inconjecturable
reason
known
only
to
the
feline
mind
adams
s
cat
had
thought
good
to
sit
out
in
the
rain
this
afternoon
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
brick
pilasters
which
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
passage
up
to
the
house
there
she
sat
unconscious
of
david
and
bags
contemplating
the
scenery
with
infinite
craft
david
having
picked
up
a
small
pebble
threw
it
with
such
accuracy
of
aim
that
it
passed
through
the
fur
at
the
top
of
her
head
between
her
ears
she
threw
up
her
paws
and
looked
wildly
round
in
startled
dismay
and
was
there
no
more
slap
between
her
ears
shrieked
david
lord
didn
t
she
look
funny
when
she
threw
her
hands
up
blow
i
ve
forgotten
maddox
s
parcel
what
an
ass
you
are
not
to
have
reminded
me
hot
bath
anyhow
then
i
ll
go
back
to
college
and
fetch
this
gale
had
caused
the
dusk
of
evening
to
close
in
very
early
and
the
passage
leading
from
the
dormitories
to
the
big
room
with
its
rows
of
baths
was
already
nearly
dark
on
either
side
of
the
passage
were
the
studies
of
the
prefects
and
david
had
to
tiptoe
delicately
through
the
since
he
owed
fifty
lines
to
cruikshank
and
had
not
yet
written
them
though
they
were
overdue
but
he
reached
the
without
encountering
the
enemy
and
wallowed
in
a
heaven
of
water
so
hot
that
if
he
moved
he
must
almost
scream
bags
was
in
a
neighbouring
bath
but
finished
his
washing
first
and
left
david
intent
as
the
water
cooled
a
little
on
matters
of
soap
and
mud
between
his
toes
then
his
head
did
not
seem
satisfactory
and
he
washed
the
showers
out
emerging
eventually
to
rub
his
head
into
a
semblance
of
dryness
this
was
a
tingling
exhilarating
affair
and
he
accompanied
it
by
bouts
of
piercing
whistlings
next
door
to
the
was
maddox
s
study
and
about
this
time
he
perceived
that
david
had
not
filled
his
kettle
for
tea
since
his
whistle
betrayed
next
door
it
was
simpler
to
go
and
fill
his
kettle
himself
rather
than
go
in
to
fetch
david
to
do
it
there
on
the
end
of
the
bench
below
the
windows
was
david
sitting
his
head
enveloped
in
a
towel
violently
scrubbing
and
whistling
whenever
the
towel
was
not
in
actual
contact
with
his
mouth
he
had
not
noticed
his
entry
and
maddox
thought
it
would
be
rather
amusing
to
sit
down
without
speech
close
beside
him
holding
out
in
mute
reproach
the
empty
kettle
that
david
should
have
filled
this
he
did
in
a
minute
david
s
head
was
sufficiently
dry
to
satisfy
him
and
it
emerged
from
its
towel
he
looked
round
astonished
to
find
any
one
there
for
bags
had
gone
hullo
maddox
he
said
yes
got
to
fill
my
kettle
myself
he
said
david
jumped
up
i
say
i
m
awfully
sorry
he
said
i
bang
forgot
give
it
me
but
maddox
still
held
it
looking
at
him
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
he
said
just
having
a
bath
were
you
david
paused
there
was
maddox
only
looking
at
him
only
smiling
but
instantly
he
had
some
sense
of
choking
discomfort
he
looked
back
at
him
frowning
and
puzzled
and
his
sense
of
discomfort
hugely
increased
he
merely
wanted
to
get
away
oh
then
i
think
i
ll
go
and
dress
he
said
hurriedly
and
picking
up
his
sponge
left
the
room
and
ran
away
down
the
dark
passage
to
his
dormitory
david
sat
down
on
his
bed
for
a
minute
feeling
as
if
he
had
escaped
from
some
distant
nightmare
that
had
vaguely
threatened
to
come
near
him
then
very
sensibly
running
away
from
it
instead
of
thinking
about
it
he
began
to
dress
in
a
great
hurry
he
washed
his
hands
over
again
went
on
rubbing
his
hair
did
anything
to
occupy
himself
in
a
few
minutes
bags
came
in
dressed
from
his
dormitory
next
door
but
david
had
no
voluble
conversation
on
hand
as
he
had
half
an
hour
ago
in
the
and
continued
dressing
in
silence
bags
tried
a
few
amiable
topics
but
got
no
more
response
than
grunts
and
monosyllables
which
were
quite
unlike
david
s
usually
rampageous
loquacity
after
three
or
four
thwarted
attempts
it
was
borne
in
upon
his
lucid
mind
that
there
was
something
the
matter
what
s
up
blazes
he
inquired
nothing
why
said
david
savagely
oh
i
don
t
know
you
haven
t
got
as
much
to
say
as
well
who
wants
to
talk
to
a
chap
like
you
asked
david
getting
his
tie
in
a
knot
and
venting
himself
in
irritation
bags
felt
slightly
hurt
for
he
was
unaware
how
he
could
have
caused
this
but
since
david
did
not
want
to
talk
to
a
chap
like
him
the
most
rudimentary
sense
of
forbade
the
chap
like
him
to
make
any
further
overtures
david
cracked
his
nail
over
his
failed
to
get
any
sort
of
parting
in
his
hair
and
broke
a
bootlace
these
material
adversities
somehow
sobered
him
and
he
began
faintly
to
see
that
really
bags
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
mood
sorry
bags
he
said
at
length
having
tied
the
ends
of
the
broken
bootlace
together
bags
was
the
most
amiable
of
mankind
and
besides
this
was
david
right
oh
he
said
at
once
but
do
tell
me
what
s
up
if
i
can
be
of
any
good
old
bags
but
you
can
t
thanks
awfully
don
t
ask
me
anything
about
it
if
you
don
t
suddenly
the
fact
of
the
parcel
at
the
lodge
which
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
down
for
maddox
presented
itself
he
felt
that
he
couldn
t
see
maddox
again
just
at
once
i
say
there
is
one
thing
you
might
do
he
said
i
wish
you
d
come
up
to
college
with
me
and
get
that
parcel
of
maddox
s
i
should
be
frightfully
obliged
if
you
would
i
m
going
to
tea
with
a
fellow
there
and
i
should
have
to
go
up
and
down
bags
felt
that
if
david
offered
this
as
an
explanation
of
his
it
was
a
pretty
thin
one
oh
is
that
all
you
re
so
sick
about
he
asked
david
s
irritability
returned
all
right
don
t
come
then
he
said
david
was
ready
by
now
and
without
another
word
he
marched
to
the
door
he
would
have
to
bring
the
parcel
up
himself
but
he
was
determined
to
get
somebody
else
to
take
it
to
maddox
s
study
wait
a
second
said
bags
in
a
slightly
injured
tone
of
course
i
ll
come
up
with
david
took
his
arm
you
are
a
brick
he
said
but
don
t
ask
me
anything
more
it
isn
t
anything
i
expect
i
ve
made
a
fool
of
shouldn
t
wonder
a
bit
said
bags
pacifically
funny
fellow
don
t
strain
maddox
had
gone
straight
back
from
the
to
his
study
without
filling
his
kettle
he
sat
for
ten
momentous
minutes
in
front
of
his
fire
without
doing
anything
without
thinking
even
but
looking
with
open
eyes
so
to
speak
on
himself
all
these
weeks
that
intense
friendship
which
was
springing
up
between
himself
and
david
had
been
splendidly
growing
and
till
now
his
influence
over
him
had
been
exerted
entirely
for
david
s
good
he
had
constantly
shielded
him
as
on
the
night
when
he
had
found
hughes
sitting
on
his
bed
from
all
that
could
sully
him
he
had
checked
any
hint
of
foul
talk
in
david
s
presence
for
of
all
his
lovable
qualities
there
was
none
so
nobly
potent
to
the
elder
boy
than
david
s
white
innocence
his
utter
want
of
curiosity
about
all
that
was
filthy
it
didn
t
exist
for
him
but
the
danger
of
it
though
thank
god
it
was
passed
he
knew
that
he
himself
had
brought
near
to
him
then
he
got
up
and
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
above
his
hating
himself
you
damned
beast
he
said
you
deserve
to
be
presently
there
came
a
tap
at
his
door
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
told
david
to
bring
up
a
parcel
for
him
probably
this
was
not
david
for
he
usually
whistled
and
hardly
ever
tapped
on
his
answer
bags
entered
oh
it
s
your
parcel
maddox
he
said
blaize
forgot
to
bring
it
down
after
we
finished
playing
squash
and
so
i
went
back
with
him
and
brought
maddox
held
out
his
hand
for
it
thanks
he
said
blazes
ask
you
to
bring
it
me
yes
he
was
having
tea
in
has
he
gone
there
yes
we
went
up
maddox
got
up
right
he
said
but
he
s
forgotten
to
fill
my
kettle
would
you
mind
please
that
was
exactly
like
maddox
he
always
thanked
fags
who
did
things
for
him
and
treated
them
politely
bags
in
consequence
retired
with
pleased
alacrity
and
returned
getting
on
all
right
crabtree
asked
maddox
no
troubles
oh
no
thanks
i
like
it
all
that
s
right
i
forget
who
your
oh
yes
he
ll
look
after
you
thanks
for
filling
my
bags
went
delicately
and
rather
proudly
away
cruikshank
never
thanked
him
maddox
put
his
heel
into
the
fire
to
make
a
level
place
for
his
kettle
and
sat
down
again
to
work
but
other
thoughts
kept
interposing
themselves
between
him
and
his
books
claiming
precedence
he
knew
from
david
s
abrupt
exit
just
now
that
he
scented
danger
or
if
that
was
too
strong
an
image
just
turned
his
back
on
the
miry
road
that
had
been
in
maddox
s
mind
and
his
getting
bags
to
do
the
forgotten
errand
confirmed
that
vaguely
perhaps
david
had
guessed
something
of
the
nature
of
that
muddy
place
and
had
gone
from
it
with
much
greater
sureness
maddox
saw
that
if
their
friendship
was
to
continue
he
must
turn
his
back
on
it
too
and
convince
david
that
he
had
done
so
he
was
ashamed
he
hated
himself
the
kettle
boiled
over
sending
a
puff
of
steam
and
light
ash
into
the
grate
and
he
took
it
off
and
put
it
in
the
fender
and
still
he
sat
there
looking
backwards
into
his
life
and
finding
no
comfort
there
and
then
looking
forwards
seeing
a
gleam
of
saving
hope
at
last
outside
his
study
there
came
a
familiar
step
but
there
was
no
whistling
and
after
the
step
paused
there
came
a
tap
at
his
door
david
entered
looking
shy
and
frightened
oh
i
came
to
clear
your
things
away
and
wash
up
he
said
hurriedly
maddox
did
not
want
to
shirk
what
lay
before
him
the
friendship
that
had
become
so
intimately
dear
to
him
was
at
stake
will
you
shut
the
door
a
minute
david
he
said
rising
and
standing
by
the
with
his
face
turned
away
david
did
so
and
remained
by
the
door
i
want
to
say
just
one
thing
said
maddox
i
m
damned
sorry
and
i
apologise
you
needn
t
be
frightened
of
me
it
shan
t
happen
again
that
s
all
there
s
nothing
to
wash
up
i
haven
t
had
some
subconscious
horror
still
lingered
in
david
s
mind
he
had
been
obliged
to
come
back
here
to
see
to
maddox
s
else
perhaps
maddox
would
have
sent
for
him
and
that
would
have
been
worse
at
the
moment
he
had
no
other
desire
in
spite
of
what
maddox
had
said
but
to
get
away
i
ll
go
then
he
said
quickly
all
david
left
the
room
but
he
had
gone
only
a
little
way
down
the
passage
outside
when
his
feet
simply
refused
to
carry
him
any
farther
or
to
allow
him
to
leave
maddox
like
this
all
his
love
and
his
loyalty
insisted
that
he
was
wrong
not
to
trust
the
regret
and
the
assurance
that
had
been
given
him
that
he
was
doing
a
mean
and
cowardly
thing
to
retreat
like
that
but
the
talk
that
he
had
had
with
the
head
on
his
last
day
at
helmsworth
was
very
vivid
in
his
mind
the
head
had
told
him
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
about
certain
things
and
his
instinct
in
spite
of
his
innocence
told
him
that
such
vaguely
and
distantly
were
the
things
about
which
the
head
had
spoken
but
the
head
had
never
told
him
to
turn
his
back
on
a
friend
or
to
refuse
to
trust
that
which
his
heart
knew
was
sincere
and
so
once
more
from
inside
maddox
heard
a
familiar
step
return
and
once
more
david
tapped
and
entered
i
don
t
know
why
i
went
away
he
said
or
why
i
was
frightened
when
you
said
i
needn
t
be
i
came
back
then
he
had
the
instant
reward
of
his
confidence
he
saw
maddox
look
up
at
him
with
unshadowed
eyes
of
affection
he
came
and
stood
close
to
him
it
s
bang
all
right
he
said
i
m
awfully
glad
it
s
all
then
a
positive
inspiration
seized
him
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
this
subject
and
the
sooner
it
was
dismissed
the
better
he
instantly
became
maddox
s
fag
again
i
say
you
re
awfully
late
having
tea
he
said
why
your
kettle
s
not
boiling
any
maddox
followed
his
lead
no
i
took
it
off
and
forgot
he
said
put
it
on
again
and
there
s
a
cake
in
the
parcel
bags
brought
take
it
out
will
you
david
tore
open
the
bag
two
cakes
he
said
which
do
you
want
now
either
you
can
stop
and
have
tea
with
me
if
you
thanks
awfully
but
i
had
tea
with
a
chap
in
well
have
david
considered
this
proposition
simply
on
its
own
merits
well
i
think
i
will
he
said
but
you
ve
got
a
rotten
fire
shan
t
i
take
your
kettle
to
the
yes
good
egg
pour
a
little
into
the
teapot
first
though
hi
not
over
my
sorry
it
didn
t
really
touch
you
did
it
maddox
laughed
no
of
course
not
i
should
have
smacked
your
head
if
it
had
thought
it
was
going
just
for
safety
said
david
i
always
swear
before
i
m
hurt
then
they
take
more
yes
stick
my
kettle
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
say
it
s
mine
if
any
one
right
said
david
it
ll
be
boiled
in
two
chapter
ix
david
had
been
placed
in
one
of
the
two
parallel
forms
just
below
the
lowest
division
of
the
fifth
form
when
he
entered
marchester
at
michaelmas
but
failed
to
get
his
promotion
at
christmas
and
now
in
the
middle
of
the
lent
term
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
nothing
in
the
world
was
more
unlikely
than
that
he
should
get
out
of
it
at
easter
there
would
be
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
boys
out
of
each
remove
promoted
then
and
as
his
place
was
seventeenth
in
the
list
of
the
results
lately
published
only
a
miracle
the
sort
that
does
not
occur
would
do
it
for
him
he
had
just
received
a
letter
on
the
subject
from
his
father
who
as
usual
david
thought
failed
to
grasp
the
situation
altogether
but
as
david
had
not
dreamed
of
telling
his
father
what
the
situation
really
was
it
was
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
archdeacon
failed
to
grasp
it
but
there
were
things
you
couldn
t
tell
your
people
and
this
was
one
at
the
moment
david
was
reading
extracts
to
bags
from
this
letter
with
comments
interspersed
he
must
have
been
an
absolute
infant
phenomenon
he
said
if
he
really
got
his
promotion
every
term
as
he
says
nobody
does
now
it
simply
isn
t
done
and
he
s
written
to
adams
about
my
work
blow
bad
luck
said
bags
and
has
asked
whether
i
hadn
t
better
have
a
private
tutor
in
latin
in
the
holidays
continued
the
outraged
david
it
s
really
too
sickening
just
as
if
one
didn
t
have
enough
of
the
dreary
fellows
in
the
term
and
of
course
i
had
to
lie
about
what
goes
on
in
the
form
he
asked
me
at
christmas
whether
there
was
any
cribbing
and
i
looked
as
if
i
simply
didn
t
know
what
cribbing
perhaps
nobody
cribbed
when
he
was
an
infant
phenomenon
said
bags
david
scratched
his
head
it
s
all
rather
rotten
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
he
said
i
only
crib
sufficiently
myself
to
get
off
impots
and
very
often
i
run
it
too
fine
and
don
t
crib
enough
but
i
do
think
it
s
rot
to
crib
your
way
to
the
top
of
the
form
cribbing
wasn
t
meant
for
that
plugs
got
full
marks
last
euclid
lesson
just
by
copying
the
propositions
slap
out
of
the
book
he
didn
t
have
the
decency
to
make
a
howler
or
two
bags
inserted
a
lump
of
sugar
in
a
small
hole
which
he
had
bitten
in
the
rind
of
an
orange
and
began
to
suck
the
sweetened
juice
he
had
come
on
amazingly
during
this
last
and
david
was
no
longer
in
the
least
ashamed
of
him
as
a
pal
he
wasn
t
any
good
at
games
and
consequently
would
have
been
an
entire
nonentity
in
any
house
except
adams
s
but
in
adams
s
so
the
rest
of
the
school
thought
even
the
juniors
took
an
interest
in
all
sorts
of
queer
things
like
reading
books
which
had
got
nothing
to
do
with
school
work
and
knowing
the
difference
between
liberals
and
conservatives
such
topics
and
pursuits
were
held
to
be
laudable
affairs
for
the
occupation
of
the
mind
in
adams
s
and
the
daily
paper
was
not
merely
the
source
from
which
it
was
discovered
who
had
made
a
century
in
a
county
match
adams
had
half
the
house
in
and
out
of
his
study
all
day
and
the
conversation
was
generally
supposed
to
be
of
the
most
abstruse
type
an
odd
thing
was
too
that
the
house
was
just
as
keen
on
games
as
any
other
and
was
possessed
of
most
of
the
competitive
cups
but
having
trained
and
practised
and
won
their
cup
the
house
did
not
make
this
the
sole
topic
of
interest
and
congratulation
this
was
not
the
usual
plan
and
the
consideration
that
bags
had
won
at
adams
s
would
certainly
not
have
been
his
elsewhere
bags
considered
this
short
disquisition
on
the
proper
sphere
of
cribbing
for
a
little
he
himself
was
in
the
parallel
remove
to
david
s
where
it
so
happened
that
no
cribbing
went
on
this
was
merely
a
question
of
fashion
and
was
as
arbitrary
and
inexplicable
as
all
other
fashions
but
as
binding
some
forms
cribbed
some
didn
t
local
fashions
not
any
sense
of
honesty
directed
it
tisn
t
a
satisfactory
state
of
things
though
he
said
if
everybody
cribbed
everything
it
would
be
all
right
because
then
everybody
would
get
full
david
laughed
but
old
tovey
is
a
suspicious
dog
he
said
and
in
that
case
he
might
suspect
something
he
s
as
blind
as
a
bat
and
you
can
have
your
crib
spread
out
on
the
desk
bang
in
front
of
his
nose
and
he
won
t
see
it
he
didn
t
ought
to
be
a
beak
at
all
i
put
out
my
tongue
at
him
the
other
day
right
out
like
that
and
held
it
there
and
he
never
saw
i
think
beaks
ought
to
have
their
eyesight
tested
every
year
or
two
like
they
do
for
the
army
to
see
if
they
re
competent
he
makes
up
for
his
eyes
by
his
ears
though
if
you
try
to
prompt
a
fellow
right
at
back
of
the
room
he
hears
a
bags
continued
to
suck
his
orange
till
david
had
finished
and
then
went
on
i
repeat
if
everybody
cribbed
everything
it
would
be
all
right
he
said
and
the
only
proper
alternative
is
that
nobody
should
crib
oh
ah
said
david
case
of
jerusalem
the
golden
as
applied
to
tovey
s
when
we
re
all
saints
we
ll
wear
nightshirts
stead
of
pyjamas
and
golden
crowns
and
bare
don
t
be
profane
said
bags
you
re
going
to
be
david
wrinkled
up
his
nose
right
oh
said
david
lord
do
you
remember
the
catechism
classes
at
helmsworth
david
finished
his
father
s
letter
and
tore
it
up
people
seem
to
think
that
we
think
the
same
way
as
they
do
he
said
that
s
such
rot
we
might
just
as
well
expect
them
to
think
the
same
way
as
us
they
ve
forgotten
about
being
fourteen
and
we
never
knew
about
being
forty
or
fifty
do
you
remember
my
pater
s
sermon
too
about
the
chapel
being
the
centre
of
school
life
just
because
the
cathedral
is
the
centre
of
his
i
think
he
s
forgotten
a
lot
about
being
a
bags
had
a
certain
persistency
about
him
cribbing
he
remarked
i
don
t
see
why
it
s
any
worse
to
get
full
marks
for
a
thing
by
cribbing
than
to
avoid
an
impot
by
cribbing
either
you
crib
or
you
don
t
if
you
crib
why
not
crib
it
all
i
don
t
see
that
plugs
is
a
bit
worse
than
you
blazes
why
don
t
you
tell
maddox
all
about
it
you
re
such
pals
with
him
though
you
are
his
my
word
you
do
have
rum
notions
he
said
it
would
be
sneaking
maddox
always
whacks
fellows
if
he
finds
they
crib
but
just
confidentially
said
bags
simply
imposh
said
david
briefly
the
door
of
their
study
was
open
and
at
the
moment
plugs
the
wholesale
cribber
came
whistling
by
his
real
name
was
gregson
and
he
was
freckled
he
put
his
head
in
and
said
frowsy
beasts
for
no
particular
reason
except
that
he
felt
cheerful
i
say
plugs
come
in
a
minute
said
david
one
of
bags
s
oranges
don
t
mind
if
i
do
said
plugs
politely
that
is
if
bags
doesn
t
mind
what
s
the
row
oh
nothing
but
we
re
just
jawing
about
cribbing
thought
you
might
not
much
to
jaw
about
remarked
plugs
it
s
a
dead
cert
that
nobody
ever
got
out
of
tovey
s
without
if
you
mean
that
why
that
s
your
mistake
said
bags
if
nobody
cribbed
fellows
would
get
out
of
tovey
s
just
the
didn
t
say
that
said
plugs
and
the
mistake
s
yours
i
said
nobody
ever
had
got
out
of
tovey
s
without
cribbing
no
more
they
have
what
would
happen
if
nobody
cribbed
ain
t
the
question
every
one
always
has
cribbed
in
tovey
s
since
the
year
one
you
can
t
help
it
with
an
owl
like
tovey
blazes
cribs
and
he
s
way
down
where
d
you
be
without
it
blazes
bim
said
david
promptly
there
you
are
then
can
t
think
why
you
don
t
crib
more
and
get
but
it
s
such
silly
rot
said
bags
you
ll
crib
yourself
into
the
some
time
nobody
cribs
in
lower
fifth
where
ll
you
be
then
i
shall
be
in
the
lower
fifth
remarked
the
astute
plugs
that
s
what
i
crib
for
then
i
shall
stop
cribbing
and
we
all
start
again
fair
besides
there
s
a
sort
of
sport
in
cribbing
you
may
always
be
nabbed
sharpens
the
faculties
oh
there
s
a
lot
to
be
said
for
it
it
would
sharpen
them
just
the
same
to
learn
your
work
said
bags
it
might
but
it
would
take
longer
i
can
learn
a
thing
in
half
the
time
if
i
use
a
crib
i
say
blazes
there
s
extra
confirmation
class
this
evening
whole
of
the
second
part
of
the
oh
blast
said
david
plugs
got
up
and
left
an
arid
on
the
table
jolly
good
orange
he
said
and
now
i
ve
got
a
squash
court
want
to
play
can
t
with
this
extra
said
david
don
t
know
a
word
of
crib
it
said
plugs
it
s
quite
short
though
tricky
just
like
the
third
hole
on
the
links
lots
of
little
david
jumped
up
yes
i
think
i
will
he
said
i
ll
do
catechi
after
dinner
i
ll
be
changed
in
two
bags
s
ideas
in
this
discussion
about
cribbing
were
limited
to
the
possibility
of
its
being
made
systematic
it
must
be
at
once
premised
that
no
sense
of
the
dishonourableness
of
the
practice
so
much
as
entered
his
head
but
it
was
absurd
that
there
should
be
no
standard
about
it
at
present
everybody
in
tovey
s
cribbed
according
to
his
lights
some
to
get
full
marks
others
more
like
david
to
avoid
impositions
and
that
owl
tovey
in
his
view
was
responsible
for
it
it
was
not
a
fellow
detected
in
cribbing
who
ought
to
get
into
a
row
but
tovey
who
made
such
a
state
of
affairs
possible
as
stated
before
in
the
parallel
form
which
bags
graced
by
his
presence
cribbing
was
unknown
this
was
probably
owing
to
fashion
but
no
doubt
the
extraordinary
quickness
of
eye
possessed
by
bills
williams
the
had
something
to
do
with
it
there
it
was
anyhow
nobody
cribbed
in
bills
s
everybody
cribbed
in
tovey
s
and
the
same
number
of
boys
were
terminally
promoted
from
each
division
into
the
lower
fifth
bags
himself
ran
a
decent
chance
of
promotion
this
half
whereas
david
had
none
but
he
knew
that
he
had
not
david
s
brains
nor
yet
the
half
of
them
david
for
instance
had
been
in
the
scholarship
examination
last
summer
whereas
there
had
been
no
question
of
bags
going
up
for
it
it
was
a
rum
world
bags
and
david
shared
their
study
together
presumably
in
equal
quantities
but
it
was
easy
to
see
which
was
the
or
from
certain
aspects
of
it
the
the
room
measured
some
ten
feet
by
twelve
and
appeared
to
be
chiefly
given
up
to
david
s
possessions
and
implements
there
were
a
couple
of
racquets
in
a
press
and
a
bag
of
a
squash
racquet
for
which
he
presently
rushed
in
buttoning
his
shirt
a
an
old
deflated
football
and
a
bag
of
there
were
about
equally
divided
a
few
cribs
belonging
to
david
and
on
the
walls
some
rather
thin
of
the
archdeaconry
and
cathedral
at
baxminster
executed
by
margery
after
the
famous
day
when
maddox
had
declared
that
it
was
the
rippingest
cathedral
in
england
and
david
s
house
the
rippingest
house
in
the
close
there
was
also
a
drawing
made
by
david
himself
of
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
which
leaned
in
an
unsatisfactory
manner
till
he
had
framed
it
slightly
crooked
in
a
cardboard
mount
which
restored
its
dangerous
want
of
equilibrium
the
two
tables
supposed
to
belong
severally
to
them
had
been
chiefly
annexed
by
david
since
and
such
paraphernalia
usurped
the
one
while
the
other
was
littered
with
his
books
bags
excavating
a
corner
for
himself
when
occasion
absolutely
demanded
but
this
predominance
of
david
s
belongings
was
not
accomplished
so
much
by
greed
on
the
part
of
david
as
by
bags
s
consistent
when
david
s
interests
clashed
with
his
own
indeed
it
indicated
one
of
the
most
popular
points
in
bags
s
character
namely
that
as
everybody
said
he
was
so
deucedly
easy
to
get
on
with
david
was
easy
to
get
on
with
too
owing
to
his
intense
appreciation
of
the
humour
of
life
in
general
and
even
when
it
was
not
humorous
he
thought
it
was
which
was
a
cheering
way
of
looking
at
things
but
of
the
two
david
both
publicly
and
privately
was
the
substance
and
bags
the
shadow
the
shadow
danced
in
obedience
to
that
which
threw
it
but
this
morning
nickname
had
stuck
to
him
in
the
new
school
for
it
was
simpler
than
crabtree
and
there
was
not
anything
else
in
particular
to
say
about
was
meditating
a
dance
of
his
own
independently
of
david
he
felt
certain
that
if
david
had
been
in
his
division
parallel
to
the
one
that
he
mildly
cribbed
in
where
cribbing
happened
not
to
be
the
vogue
he
would
probably
be
somewhere
near
the
top
of
the
form
though
as
it
was
he
was
of
the
way
down
david
himself
bore
the
weight
of
things
as
they
were
with
complete
equanimity
for
there
they
were
and
he
cribbed
sufficiently
to
avoid
the
tedium
of
impositions
but
not
sufficiently
to
secure
himself
a
decent
place
he
appeared
to
be
quite
content
with
this
state
of
affairs
except
in
so
far
that
it
might
lead
to
having
a
private
tutor
in
the
holidays
whereas
to
bags
it
all
seemed
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
no
doubt
if
david
turned
to
and
worked
with
industry
and
zeal
he
might
make
his
difficult
way
upwards
but
it
was
a
tremendous
handicap
to
be
obliged
to
sweat
your
eyes
out
in
order
to
get
on
level
terms
with
people
who
slowly
and
correctly
construed
out
of
an
english
translation
of
the
lesson
and
david
would
have
been
the
first
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
such
a
proposal
it
was
less
trouble
to
sit
seventeenth
in
the
form
and
avoid
impositions
bags
was
not
very
good
at
independent
action
his
line
was
action
that
fell
in
with
other
people
s
wishes
and
he
meditated
over
any
possible
idea
that
might
suggest
itself
to
him
in
his
new
r√¥le
he
would
have
liked
to
tell
adams
confidentially
of
course
that
remove
a
relied
so
largely
on
tovey
s
shortsightedness
but
apart
from
the
general
feeling
that
this
would
be
sneaking
there
was
a
considerable
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
how
adams
would
take
it
adams
was
a
splendid
chap
of
was
the
only
possible
view
to
hold
of
him
but
it
was
undeniable
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
bothered
he
liked
things
to
be
pleasant
he
liked
fellows
to
come
and
sit
about
in
his
study
with
clean
hands
and
a
parting
in
their
hair
and
to
be
happy
and
contented
he
liked
them
also
to
be
interested
in
general
topics
and
to
bring
their
work
to
him
for
help
but
he
did
not
like
to
know
that
were
being
broken
or
that
the
house
was
not
getting
on
in
a
saintly
and
successful
manner
he
wanted
it
to
manage
its
own
affairs
while
he
like
a
genial
father
coming
home
in
the
evening
to
his
family
saw
only
bright
and
cheerful
faces
round
him
once
bags
remembered
cruikshank
had
consulted
him
on
a
case
where
bullying
was
suspected
and
bags
at
cruikshank
s
invitation
had
been
present
as
a
witness
but
cruikshank
s
reception
though
perfectly
cordial
had
not
been
of
a
sort
to
encourage
confidence
adams
had
thanked
him
had
appreciated
his
good
intentions
but
had
told
him
that
he
was
sure
the
feeling
of
the
house
would
prevent
any
such
occurrence
in
the
future
the
feeling
of
the
house
was
the
best
jury
and
he
wished
to
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
prefects
bags
conjectured
quite
easily
from
his
recollection
of
this
what
was
likely
to
be
his
own
reception
if
he
informed
adams
confidentially
that
remove
a
consistently
cribbed
no
that
would
not
do
and
david
had
been
horrified
at
the
idea
of
maddox
being
told
then
quite
suddenly
all
scheme
of
independent
action
was
taken
from
bags
somewhere
down
the
passage
a
door
was
opened
and
david
s
name
was
shouted
david
in
any
case
was
not
here
having
gone
to
play
squash
and
though
the
voice
was
maddox
s
bags
saw
no
reason
for
going
to
tell
him
if
david
did
not
answer
he
would
conclude
that
david
did
not
hear
probably
maddox
only
wanted
him
in
a
general
sort
of
way
then
came
a
step
along
the
passage
from
the
where
the
prefects
studies
were
and
along
the
corridor
and
round
the
corner
and
maddox
entered
genial
and
cordial
as
usual
david
out
he
asked
why
didn
t
you
shout
not
at
home
but
when
he
comes
in
you
might
tell
maddox
s
eye
wandered
round
the
study
i
say
what
a
mess
you
and
david
keep
your
room
in
he
said
piles
of
books
and
in
between
what
s
this
maddox
suddenly
took
up
from
the
table
a
book
in
a
dark
blue
cover
it
was
an
english
translation
of
thucydides
edited
by
the
obliging
bohn
is
this
yours
he
asked
yes
said
bags
instantly
well
i
shall
confiscate
it
and
i
shall
whack
you
better
come
and
be
whacked
now
and
get
it
over
but
it
s
a
damned
bad
plan
to
use
cribs
bags
when
you
get
into
the
fifth
form
you
ll
find
you
re
no
end
of
a
way
behind
fellows
who
ve
worked
their
way
up
instead
of
cribbing
their
way
up
got
any
more
of
these
silly
things
let
s
have
them
all
i
don
t
want
to
search
your
study
you
know
i
would
much
sooner
you
gave
me
them
all
of
them
and
told
me
there
aren
t
any
more
word
of
honour
you
bags
thought
feverishly
a
moment
there
are
several
more
he
said
right
let
s
have
bags
got
down
from
the
table
where
he
was
sitting
feeling
rather
limp
physically
but
quite
resolved
to
see
this
through
meantime
unfortunately
maddox
had
opened
the
volume
of
bohn
s
thucydides
with
the
idle
habit
of
the
and
turned
to
the
and
you
wrote
david
s
name
in
it
though
it
was
yours
he
asked
here
was
an
awful
complication
and
what
an
unspeakable
ass
was
david
so
thought
bags
to
write
his
name
in
a
crib
he
remembered
his
doing
it
now
in
greek
characters
he
quite
intensely
wished
he
had
not
said
it
was
his
own
but
that
he
proposed
to
stick
to
and
if
maddox
chose
he
might
think
him
guilty
of
the
unutterable
meanness
of
owning
a
crib
and
writing
a
pal
s
name
in
it
yes
i
wrote
blaize
s
name
in
it
he
said
in
but
he
did
not
say
it
particularly
well
or
maddox
was
confoundedly
sharp
probably
both
oh
that
s
a
lie
isn
t
it
he
said
bags
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
and
any
other
uncomfortable
neighbours
that
are
possible
to
a
boy
he
had
been
quite
prepared
to
take
a
whacking
on
david
s
behalf
and
though
the
flesh
was
weak
his
spirit
really
embraced
the
opportunity
but
now
just
as
likely
as
not
he
was
going
to
take
a
whacking
on
his
own
behalf
without
getting
david
off
it
was
all
pretty
bad
but
how
could
he
have
foreseen
that
maddox
would
look
at
the
or
have
forgotten
that
david
had
been
such
a
juggins
as
to
write
his
name
there
so
being
landed
in
this
awkward
place
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stop
there
no
that
s
all
right
he
said
i
wrote
blaize
s
name
maddox
looked
at
him
so
it
seemed
to
bags
with
a
certain
respectful
sympathy
and
in
david
s
handwriting
he
asked
makings
of
a
forger
and
are
you
doing
thucydides
this
half
david
is
i
know
because
i
ve
often
given
him
construes
but
you
re
in
the
other
remove
aren
t
you
it
was
no
use
lying
about
this
bags
surrendered
and
told
the
truth
yes
in
remove
b
he
said
then
you
can
t
be
doing
thucydides
because
they
always
do
different
books
oh
cave
in
out
with
it
well
then
it
s
blaize
s
crib
said
the
unsuccessful
bags
so
i
knew
why
did
you
say
it
was
yours
i
don
t
know
said
bags
think
bags
threw
his
sucked
orange
the
third
of
them
into
the
basket
because
i
thought
you
d
just
whack
me
and
there
wouldn
t
be
any
more
bother
he
said
maddox
again
looked
sympathetic
just
to
save
blaize
a
whacking
he
asked
bags
suddenly
took
courage
maddox
was
such
a
ripper
he
would
understand
no
not
altogether
he
said
but
i
felt
i
d
sooner
let
you
think
it
was
mine
than
his
he
s
so
awfully
proud
of
you
i
didn
t
want
you
to
know
that
oh
blast
it
all
he
added
desperately
maddox
kicked
the
door
shut
you
didn
t
want
me
to
know
he
cribbed
he
said
because
then
i
shouldn
t
think
him
such
an
awfully
decent
chap
about
that
said
bags
maddox
nodded
you
re
a
good
chap
bags
he
said
but
i
ve
found
out
that
david
cribs
in
spite
of
you
and
i
shall
whack
him
for
it
tisn
t
your
fault
you
did
your
very
best
and
a
rather
good
one
too
to
prevent
it
but
cribbing
is
all
rot
i
hadn
t
an
idea
david
cribbed
do
other
fellows
in
remove
a
crib
much
then
bags
saw
his
opportunity
made
for
him
from
beginning
to
end
here
was
maddox
who
mattered
so
much
more
than
adams
or
any
one
else
asking
for
information
instead
of
being
reluctantly
saddled
with
it
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
since
david
had
been
so
horrified
at
the
thought
of
maddox
being
told
but
then
maddox
said
tain
t
sneaking
bags
i
m
not
going
to
make
visitations
cept
on
david
in
fact
i
want
to
clear
things
bags
s
hesitation
vanished
yes
they
all
crib
in
remove
a
he
said
it
s
just
the
fashion
blazes
doesn
t
crib
much
only
enough
to
avoid
impots
other
fellows
crib
to
get
marks
that
s
why
he
s
so
never
thought
of
that
said
maddox
no
why
should
you
but
there
it
and
do
the
fellows
at
the
top
of
the
form
crib
asked
maddox
remember
you
re
not
giving
anybody
away
in
the
sneaking
rather
that
s
why
they
re
maddox
had
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
books
and
and
there
was
a
and
spilling
as
he
got
up
thanks
he
said
i
ll
think
what
can
be
done
and
remember
you
know
nothing
about
it
all
but
the
fact
that
i
ve
found
a
crib
of
david
s
is
another
matter
send
him
to
me
when
he
comes
there
was
a
piercing
and
cheerful
whistle
outside
at
this
moment
quite
unmistakable
and
david
burst
gaily
in
hullo
maddox
he
said
hullo
i
say
i
ve
got
a
thucydides
crib
of
yours
here
with
your
name
written
in
it
you
silly
ass
collect
all
the
cribs
you
ve
got
and
bring
them
to
my
study
i
m
going
to
whack
you
he
waited
a
moment
just
to
make
sure
that
david
was
not
going
to
say
that
everybody
cribbed
in
remove
a
of
course
david
said
nothing
of
the
kind
and
he
went
back
to
his
study
bags
you
ass
said
david
innocent
of
all
that
bags
had
attempted
to
do
why
didn
t
you
sit
on
it
or
something
when
he
came
in
couldn
t
there
simply
wasn
t
david
searched
his
shelves
swearing
softly
to
himself
and
the
result
was
a
rather
voluminous
load
i
shall
simply
descend
to
the
bottom
of
the
form
he
said
private
tutor
too
in
the
easter
holidays
oh
damn
i
think
you
might
have
managed
something
maddox
lays
on
too
it
s
a
blasted
david
had
grown
in
breadth
no
less
than
in
height
during
this
last
but
it
was
an
extremely
limp
figure
that
appeared
in
maddox
s
study
a
few
minutes
afterwards
with
eight
volumes
of
bohn
s
classical
series
he
had
felt
rather
queer
all
morning
and
the
sight
of
a
on
the
table
gave
him
an
unpleasant
qualm
maddox
took
the
books
from
him
these
are
all
david
he
asked
yes
that
s
the
anything
to
say
asked
maddox
david
might
have
had
something
to
say
namely
that
everybody
cribbed
in
tovey
s
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
however
remotely
to
say
it
no
he
said
cept
that
i
ve
got
beastly
thin
flannels
so
i
see
i
m
not
going
to
jaw
you
as
well
as
lick
you
but
cribbing
s
an
utterly
rotten
game
and
i
always
whack
anybody
whom
i
find
doing
it
so
get
over
that
chair
i
shall
give
you
gosh
said
david
quietly
presenting
himself
maddox
gave
him
four
and
not
in
fun
it
was
not
meant
to
be
fun
and
david
felt
the
cold
sweat
stand
on
his
forehead
he
could
just
prevent
himself
from
crying
out
but
there
was
not
much
to
spare
and
he
felt
doubtful
if
he
could
stand
two
more
but
maddox
at
the
same
moment
felt
that
he
certainly
couldn
t
and
he
threw
the
into
the
corner
that
s
enough
he
said
david
straightened
himself
up
and
turned
round
wiping
the
sweat
from
a
very
white
face
can
whack
he
said
i
say
i
feel
rather
bad
may
there
was
a
sudden
singing
in
his
ears
and
maddox
caught
him
as
he
reeled
and
put
him
gently
down
into
a
chair
as
he
leaned
on
him
but
david
s
faintness
was
only
momentary
and
recovering
almost
instantly
he
saw
that
maddox
was
looking
almost
as
queer
as
he
himself
felt
i
m
all
right
again
he
said
i
say
thanks
awfully
for
not
giving
me
six
rotten
of
me
to
feel
squeamish
but
i
couldn
t
help
i
say
for
god
s
sake
don
t
crib
again
david
he
said
or
anyhow
don
t
let
me
catch
david
smiled
and
got
up
rather
gingerly
he
understood
nothing
of
what
was
in
his
friend
s
mind
knowing
only
that
he
had
been
caught
with
a
crib
and
that
summary
retribution
had
been
most
effectively
carried
out
i
ll
jolly
well
try
not
to
he
said
right
shake
a
paw
then
said
maddox
by
the
way
bags
tried
to
make
me
think
the
crib
was
me
so
in
then
i
found
your
david
stared
jolly
decent
of
bags
he
said
but
whatever
did
he
do
that
for
i
expect
he
s
rather
fond
of
you
remarked
maddox
maddox
gave
two
days
consideration
as
to
the
question
of
the
next
step
to
be
taken
and
found
the
rival
claims
of
honour
and
justice
rather
hard
to
reconcile
as
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
he
cared
not
one
farthing
what
the
remove
a
would
think
of
him
in
case
if
as
he
thought
he
might
have
to
do
he
went
to
adams
or
the
head
master
with
the
information
that
cribbing
was
the
fashion
in
that
form
but
he
realised
that
it
would
never
do
if
it
came
out
somehow
that
bags
was
the
source
from
whom
his
information
had
been
derived
remove
a
would
argue
with
irrefutable
logic
that
somebody
must
have
sneaked
and
would
take
all
steps
with
all
the
ingenuity
that
was
theirs
to
find
out
who
had
done
so
again
there
was
david
on
whom
suspicion
might
fall
it
would
be
certainly
known
that
maddox
had
licked
him
for
cribbing
it
would
very
likely
be
inferred
that
he
in
though
the
had
proved
singularly
ineffective
had
tried
to
justify
himself
by
saying
that
the
practice
was
a
universal
one
and
that
was
precisely
what
david
had
refrained
from
saying
it
would
be
the
rankest
injustice
that
he
should
be
executed
for
cribbing
and
disgraced
by
the
supposition
that
he
had
attempted
to
justify
himself
on
the
other
hand
cribbing
was
a
rotten
system
and
maddox
intended
to
do
his
best
to
stop
it
it
was
not
easy
to
decide
what
to
do
and
he
turned
all
his
acute
boyish
brain
to
the
solving
of
the
problem
which
to
him
seemed
one
of
the
utmost
delicacy
and
importance
it
made
all
the
difference
to
the
of
the
house
which
quite
rightly
was
to
him
the
world
that
remove
a
should
cease
to
crib
and
that
they
should
be
unaware
how
the
news
of
their
habits
had
come
to
the
authorities
he
wanted
to
take
the
wisest
course
and
had
he
considered
the
matter
a
trivial
one
he
would
have
been
in
his
sphere
and
for
his
age
every
whit
as
culpable
as
the
prime
minister
of
a
state
who
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
some
astounding
national
abuse
it
mattered
immensely
and
indeed
more
than
he
knew
for
the
right
management
of
the
affairs
of
such
small
kingdoms
as
a
house
or
a
form
in
a
public
school
goes
to
build
up
the
foundations
of
the
right
management
of
the
affairs
of
big
kingdoms
character
and
judgment
are
formed
there
a
responsible
boy
takes
into
the
big
world
exactly
that
which
he
has
learned
in
smaller
spheres
maddox
it
may
be
remarked
not
being
a
prig
did
not
indulge
in
those
edifying
reflections
but
only
said
to
himself
as
he
scratched
his
curly
head
i
m
damned
if
i
know
what
to
do
but
his
wise
boy
s
brain
worked
and
explored
and
burrowed
and
two
days
after
he
went
to
his
i
hate
bothering
you
sir
he
said
but
i
m
in
a
cruikshank
asked
adams
who
knew
there
was
not
much
cordiality
lost
between
the
two
for
himself
he
respected
cruikshank
but
loved
maddox
oh
no
crookles
and
i
are
getting
on
all
right
thanks
it
s
another
adams
as
has
been
stated
disliked
exercising
his
authority
he
held
the
slightly
dangerous
creed
that
a
house
managed
itself
best
when
left
alone
and
that
public
opinion
was
the
most
effective
check
on
irregular
practices
you
always
manage
house
affairs
much
better
than
i
could
frank
he
said
don
t
know
about
that
sir
but
this
affects
more
than
the
adams
lit
his
pipe
he
rather
wanted
to
play
golf
but
maddox
seldom
bothered
him
with
problems
and
it
might
be
well
to
listen
fire
ahead
then
he
said
well
sir
i
had
to
lick
david
a
couple
of
days
ago
for
having
cribs
began
maddox
why
isn
t
the
little
beast
higher
in
his
form
then
remarked
adams
i
was
coming
to
that
i
learned
from
another
everybody
cribs
in
remove
a
that
it
s
absolutely
the
regular
thing
which
is
rotten
also
i
learned
that
david
cribs
only
about
enough
to
avoid
impots
whereas
other
fellows
crib
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
class
it
isn
t
fair
adams
decided
to
go
into
this
shut
the
door
frank
he
said
of
course
all
you
say
is
confidential
unless
you
give
me
leave
to
mention
it
go
on
well
sir
it
s
really
all
s
tovey
s
fault
said
maddox
you
see
he
s
so
jolly
blind
that
fellows
practically
must
then
david
has
been
suffering
vicariously
for
tovey
remarked
adams
maddox
laughed
yes
sir
about
that
he
said
adams
relit
his
pipe
funny
thing
this
should
have
happened
just
now
he
said
for
tovey
has
been
sent
to
bed
with
maddox
gave
a
cackle
of
delight
gosh
what
luck
he
said
why
instantly
a
scheme
lit
itself
up
in
maddox
s
head
why
sir
you
might
suggest
to
the
head
that
some
of
the
me
i
take
some
of
tovey
s
work
he
s
rather
keen
on
that
sort
of
thing
don
t
you
remember
he
told
me
to
take
your
form
for
a
couple
of
days
when
you
were
laid
up
last
half
well
sir
if
you
could
manage
that
i
descended
on
them
out
of
the
blue
say
morning
before
they
know
that
tovey
s
gone
sick
i
bet
i
can
reap
a
lot
of
them
in
they
re
sure
to
have
learned
their
work
with
cribs
and
then
you
see
i
ve
got
david
s
cribs
and
i
can
tell
if
their
construing
comes
out
of
cribs
o
lord
i
see
it
all
adams
considered
this
and
how
about
telling
the
head
that
the
form
cribs
he
asked
perhaps
he
d
join
in
and
take
some
of
the
work
himself
maddox
laughed
again
gosh
what
a
time
remove
a
s
going
to
have
he
said
but
the
head
mustn
t
make
it
retrospective
it
must
all
be
found
out
afresh
sir
if
you
see
what
i
adams
nodded
yes
he
said
the
head
will
understand
later
in
the
day
a
conference
between
the
powers
hostile
to
remove
a
was
held
the
powers
in
question
being
the
head
adams
and
maddox
and
a
diabolical
plan
of
campaign
was
hatched
the
classical
work
of
the
form
hitherto
presided
over
blindfold
so
to
speak
by
tovey
was
to
be
taken
with
the
suddenness
of
a
thunderstorm
by
maddox
not
a
word
was
to
be
said
he
was
simply
to
march
in
at
early
school
next
day
and
open
fire
on
his
own
system
the
lesson
was
virgil
and
that
evening
he
closely
studied
the
excellent
translation
as
given
by
bohn
in
the
volume
he
had
confiscated
from
david
construing
began
from
the
top
of
the
form
and
boy
after
boy
translated
with
extreme
elegance
and
fluency
and
maddox
was
beaming
and
complimentary
among
his
other
weird
accomplishments
he
knew
shorthand
and
screened
by
the
sloping
cover
of
his
desk
he
made
an
accurate
transcript
of
what
the
translation
of
each
boy
had
been
yes
very
good
very
good
indeed
he
said
when
this
was
finished
quite
a
lot
of
you
have
got
full
he
opened
the
lid
of
his
desk
and
took
out
of
it
the
virgil
crib
which
he
had
confiscated
from
david
three
days
before
i
hadn
t
time
to
mug
it
all
up
he
remarked
and
so
i
shall
just
read
you
through
a
translation
out
of
a
crib
came
into
my
possession
a
few
days
he
began
read
a
line
or
two
then
stopped
and
consulted
his
shorthand
notes
then
he
nodded
to
the
top
of
the
form
just
the
expression
you
used
he
said
genially
he
went
on
a
little
farther
i
think
that
is
how
you
translated
it
mean
gregson
he
observed
to
the
second
boy
this
was
not
quite
comfortable
and
uneasy
glances
passed
about
who
could
possibly
have
expected
that
maddox
would
bring
a
crib
into
form
there
was
a
really
distressing
parallelism
between
it
and
the
renderings
given
by
most
of
the
boys
and
in
consequence
there
were
pensive
faces
but
maddox
made
no
further
comment
and
proceeded
to
ask
a
few
questions
about
grammar
and
now
he
said
you
will
turn
on
a
hundred
lines
farther
and
translate
on
paper
the
twelve
lines
beginning
at
line
you
will
use
no
books
at
all
for
this
neither
dictionaries
any
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
silence
broken
only
by
the
scratchings
of
labouring
pens
the
unlucky
gregson
who
had
been
positively
brilliant
over
the
prepared
lines
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
fairly
elementary
passage
that
maddox
had
set
and
ventured
on
a
protest
i
say
tovey
never
gives
us
unseens
he
said
i
dare
say
but
i
do
remarked
maddox
suppressed
giggles
this
was
rather
a
score
nor
do
i
allow
laughing
he
added
decidedly
this
hour
was
not
going
very
comfortably
and
no
alleviation
was
possible
for
it
was
somehow
quite
hopeless
to
think
of
ragging
maddox
it
was
also
very
nearly
hopeless
to
translate
this
unknown
passage
and
then
a
thing
far
more
dreadful
happened
than
any
that
had
gone
before
the
door
of
the
opened
and
the
head
entered
in
rustling
silk
gown
he
nodded
to
maddox
who
got
up
all
going
well
he
said
in
tovey
s
absence
the
form
did
not
think
so
but
unfortunately
the
head
had
not
asked
them
what
are
you
doing
with
them
maddox
he
said
virgil
lesson
sir
he
said
we
ve
had
the
prepared
lesson
and
i
ve
set
them
a
short
very
good
practice
said
the
head
and
the
marks
for
the
seen
translation
were
satisfactory
yes
sir
very
said
maddox
excellent
please
take
the
unseen
translations
over
to
my
house
after
school
and
i
will
look
them
over
myself
it
isn
t
fair
to
give
you
all
the
yes
sir
said
maddox
the
head
still
lingered
by
maddox
s
desk
in
a
rather
beastly
fashion
and
peered
he
was
a
little
at
maddox
s
shorthand
notes
and
what
are
those
cabalistic
symbols
he
asked
just
notes
i
took
in
shorthand
of
the
fellows
translations
sir
he
answered
ha
i
shall
like
to
compare
these
with
the
unseen
write
them
out
for
me
maddox
will
you
and
bring
them
over
to
me
and
this
he
took
up
the
volume
of
bohn
s
translation
which
maddox
had
been
reading
out
of
it
s
a
bohn
sir
said
maddox
i
brought
it
in
myself
i
hadn
t
time
to
learn
up
the
lesson
and
i
thought
i
d
better
have
a
crib
by
the
head
so
thought
the
eager
audience
looked
rather
stern
for
a
moment
then
quite
naturally
he
laughed
i
shall
confiscate
that
he
said
looking
pleasantly
round
better
practice
for
you
maddox
to
get
up
your
lesson
without
he
rustled
out
again
leaving
uneasiness
behind
him
it
had
been
rather
sport
to
see
maddox
s
crib
taken
from
him
but
behind
that
somewhat
superficial
pleasure
there
was
a
vague
idea
that
dangerous
things
were
getting
into
dangerous
hands
maddox
had
been
bidden
to
supply
the
shorthand
notes
of
the
prepared
translation
which
would
reveal
the
parallelisms
between
bohn
s
renderings
and
that
of
the
remove
a
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
if
the
head
in
an
abstracted
moment
consulted
bohn
also
added
to
that
there
was
the
fact
that
the
head
was
going
to
look
over
the
unseen
work
and
would
no
doubt
be
struck
by
the
amazing
contrast
between
that
and
the
prepared
lesson
it
was
almost
too
much
to
expect
that
he
would
credit
the
form
with
such
extraordinary
industry
and
taste
as
to
have
prepared
their
set
piece
so
perfectly
and
yet
to
be
so
lamentably
wanting
over
an
unseen
such
at
least
was
the
private
meditation
of
most
of
remove
a
who
wished
severally
and
collectively
that
they
had
not
been
so
brilliant
over
the
first
part
of
the
lesson
breakfast
and
desultory
confabulation
when
the
form
assembled
again
for
the
next
lesson
had
not
tended
to
make
things
more
comfortable
but
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
be
suspicious
about
as
to
the
manner
in
which
those
decrees
of
fate
had
unfolded
themselves
tovey
had
happened
to
have
influenza
the
head
had
happened
to
tell
maddox
to
take
his
place
and
maddox
had
happened
to
set
them
an
unseen
and
to
take
shorthand
notes
of
their
previous
translation
and
the
head
had
happened
to
come
in
to
see
how
maddox
was
getting
on
and
had
taken
for
his
own
delectation
a
crib
shorthand
notes
made
manifest
and
those
dreadful
attempts
at
an
unseen
all
this
was
hurriedly
debated
after
remove
a
assembled
for
second
school
awaiting
the
arrival
of
maddox
who
was
a
little
late
and
so
it
was
sarcastically
said
was
probably
mugging
up
the
thucydides
lesson
in
another
crib
then
the
uneasiness
increased
into
dismay
for
the
door
opened
and
there
appeared
not
maddox
at
all
but
the
head
himself
he
had
a
packet
of
papers
in
his
hand
which
were
rightly
and
instantly
conjectured
to
be
the
virgil
unseen
of
the
hour
before
hamilton
did
everything
rather
quietly
and
slowly
and
was
distinguished
for
a
politeness
of
manner
that
on
occasion
became
terrible
he
had
never
been
as
far
as
the
school
was
aware
notable
for
athletic
prowess
but
in
spite
of
this
defect
he
was
always
a
keen
observer
of
cricket
and
football
matches
and
was
certainly
intelligent
about
these
matters
so
that
his
heart
was
felt
to
be
in
the
right
place
it
was
quite
certain
also
that
his
head
was
in
the
right
place
for
he
had
been
the
senior
classic
and
chancellor
s
medallist
at
cambridge
a
fact
which
was
viewed
in
the
light
of
a
strong
testimonial
in
favour
of
the
dead
languages
but
quite
apart
from
any
of
his
accomplishments
was
the
cause
of
the
awed
respect
in
which
he
was
held
and
though
the
sixth
themselves
could
not
have
told
you
why
he
was
so
impressive
a
person
the
reason
except
to
boys
was
not
far
to
seek
it
was
the
justness
and
the
bigness
of
him
his
thing
not
definable
by
those
whose
characters
are
not
yet
formed
but
quite
clearly
appreciable
by
them
to
please
the
head
was
worth
effort
his
praise
was
of
the
nature
of
a
decoration
it
may
be
added
that
it
was
quite
as
well
worth
an
effort
to
avoid
displeasing
him
he
went
with
his
rustling
gown
gathered
up
in
his
arm
straight
to
the
desk
that
tovey
was
wont
to
occupy
and
for
five
awful
minutes
without
the
slightest
allusion
to
thucydides
continued
reading
from
the
sheaf
of
papers
he
carried
with
him
he
did
not
look
at
all
pleasant
as
occasionally
he
made
a
note
or
occasionally
drew
his
thick
blue
pencil
across
a
page
and
all
the
time
the
hapless
remove
a
sat
in
a
state
of
confirmed
pessimism
it
was
noticed
that
he
had
divided
his
sheaf
into
two
packets
he
came
to
the
end
of
it
and
tore
up
across
and
across
the
larger
packet
of
the
two
the
rest
numbered
perhaps
half
a
dozen
sheets
then
he
spoke
i
have
never
seen
a
worse
set
of
unseen
translations
than
those
which
the
form
showed
up
to
maddox
this
morning
he
said
some
are
passable
and
one
that
of
blaize
is
good
or
nearly
so
blaize
yes
sir
said
blaize
what
is
your
place
in
the
form
by
the
marks
seventeenth
sir
said
david
from
his
lowly
abode
the
head
glared
at
him
and
spoke
very
advisedly
that
is
a
disgraceful
place
for
a
boy
who
can
make
such
a
decent
unseen
translation
he
observed
this
had
precisely
the
effect
that
that
diabolical
head
had
intended
rather
bad
luck
on
blaize
reflected
the
form
generally
to
be
whacked
for
cribbing
and
then
to
be
slated
by
the
head
for
being
so
low
the
head
paused
a
moment
you
may
close
your
books
for
the
present
he
said
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
it
is
an
extremely
serious
matter
before
doing
your
unseen
you
construed
a
piece
of
prepared
work
and
out
of
the
boys
in
the
form
sixteen
got
practically
full
marks
for
it
you
may
remember
that
at
last
lesson
i
took
away
from
maddox
the
crib
he
had
brought
in
with
him
and
i
also
took
the
transcription
of
the
shorthand
notes
he
had
made
i
see
by
referring
to
the
crib
that
all
or
i
think
nearly
all
of
the
boys
who
got
full
marks
had
used
that
crib
they
had
not
even
the
sense
to
alter
their
translations
so
that
their
indebtedness
to
it
should
not
have
been
so
glaringly
obvious
they
are
fools
in
fact
as
well
as
knaves
and
i
have
no
use
in
remove
a
or
in
any
other
part
of
the
school
for
either
now
i
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
asking
any
of
you
if
you
used
a
crib
or
not
because
without
your
telling
me
i
know
that
you
did
i
will
just
take
one
instance
the
first
that
comes
to
hand
gregson
translated
his
prepared
lesson
perfectly
and
in
it
used
three
expressions
which
were
identical
with
expressions
in
bohn
s
translation
his
unseen
on
the
other
hand
was
simply
beneath
contempt
i
use
his
name
only
as
the
first
that
occurs
to
me
and
i
do
not
single
him
out
as
being
a
worse
offender
than
many
others
nor
do
i
wish
him
or
any
of
you
to
confess
still
less
to
deny
that
he
used
a
crib
he
and
you
alike
are
a
very
rotten
set
of
the
form
generally
during
this
quiet
and
biting
address
was
growing
stiff
with
horror
and
gregson
who
as
plugs
had
conversed
so
lightly
in
bags
s
study
about
the
advantages
of
cribbing
was
feeling
singularly
empty
it
was
one
thing
to
talk
airily
about
the
merits
of
the
system
but
they
were
not
so
apparent
when
the
head
spoke
like
this
about
its
demerits
he
let
this
sink
in
for
a
bit
without
looking
at
poor
plugs
any
more
than
at
anybody
else
then
he
continued
i
have
looked
through
the
marks
of
the
he
said
and
it
is
quite
inconceivable
to
me
that
such
high
marks
as
those
earned
by
the
boys
who
are
at
the
top
of
the
form
could
have
been
come
by
honestly
i
am
therefore
going
to
cancel
the
whole
of
the
marks
which
determine
your
places
and
begin
fresh
with
the
marks
for
the
unseen
which
i
have
just
looked
over
you
will
therefore
now
take
your
places
in
the
new
order
which
i
shall
read
out
and
the
whole
of
the
marks
of
the
term
hitherto
are
cancelled
if
any
boy
high
or
low
in
the
newly
constituted
form
has
the
slightest
protest
to
make
he
will
please
state
it
fully
and
i
will
listen
to
it
with
respect
i
am
not
talking
sarcastically
and
i
only
want
to
do
justice
roughly
no
doubt
but
to
the
best
of
my
power
i
dare
say
you
have
all
used
cribs
to
a
certain
extent
but
i
do
not
want
to
go
into
that
unless
any
one
wishes
me
to
it
is
dishonest
to
use
cribs
at
all
and
there
is
the
end
of
the
matter
i
will
however
go
into
any
individual
case
for
the
purpose
of
doing
justice
you
may
talk
it
over
among
yourselves
if
you
wish
and
while
you
do
so
i
will
leave
your
and
come
back
when
you
have
made
up
your
minds
if
any
boy
wishes
me
to
go
he
will
please
hold
up
his
hand
and
go
i
will
no
notice
will
be
taken
by
me
of
the
owner
of
any
hand
that
is
held
they
could
appreciate
that
there
was
a
justice
about
it
that
commanded
respect
but
though
the
head
s
promise
was
implicitly
trusted
by
all
present
not
a
hand
was
held
up
the
head
gave
ample
time
for
this
i
take
it
then
you
are
satisfied
he
said
at
length
you
will
therefore
take
your
places
in
the
new
order
and
do
not
take
any
books
out
of
your
desks
before
you
take
your
new
places
i
will
read
the
list
and
each
boy
will
take
his
place
according
to
these
marks
as
his
name
is
there
was
the
scraping
of
boots
the
stir
of
changed
places
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
new
order
was
established
and
now
said
the
head
every
boy
will
look
in
his
new
desk
and
give
to
its
previous
occupant
all
its
contents
with
the
exception
of
any
cribs
that
there
may
be
there
now
make
the
exchanges
and
place
all
cribs
you
find
in
front
of
my
there
was
an
impression
at
this
point
that
the
head
was
showing
ignorance
he
should
have
known
that
most
cribs
were
not
brought
into
school
at
all
and
that
the
large
majority
of
them
were
securely
reposing
in
their
owners
studies
but
here
they
reckoned
without
their
host
some
dozen
books
were
given
up
a
very
meagre
total
and
the
form
generally
wrong
once
more
expected
that
the
head
would
make
a
visitation
himself
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
you
will
now
he
said
each
of
you
go
to
the
house
and
the
study
of
the
boy
whose
place
you
now
occupy
and
bring
me
all
the
cribs
you
find
there
i
have
told
maddox
to
go
round
after
you
i
sincerely
he
will
find
nothing
to
do
if
he
does
the
consequences
will
be
quite
serious
i
shall
come
back
here
in
exactly
twenty
minutes
and
shall
expect
to
find
the
books
ready
piled
here
maddox
will
go
his
rounds
after
you
have
finished
and
report
to
me
you
all
of
you
share
studies
with
other
boys
and
you
will
understand
that
all
cribs
found
therein
will
be
brought
here
whether
belonging
to
members
of
this
form
or
not
now
you
had
the
opportunity
of
consulting
each
other
before
and
you
must
not
consult
now
if
any
of
you
don
t
know
the
house
to
which
the
owner
of
your
present
desk
belongs
the
head
got
up
rustled
down
the
room
and
went
out
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
a
perfectly
silent
form
dispersed
they
were
back
again
in
their
places
before
he
reappeared
in
front
of
his
desk
was
a
solid
pile
of
books
he
did
not
even
glance
at
them
we
will
now
do
our
thucydides
he
said
who
is
the
top
boy
of
the
form
you
blaize
what
chapter
of
what
book
are
you
at
book
three
sir
said
david
chapter
read
the
greek
then
aloud
till
i
stop
you
and
then
a
rather
trying
followed
the
form
generally
was
addled
with
emotion
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
maddox
appeared
from
his
search
he
had
no
fresh
and
incriminating
volumes
with
him
but
he
might
have
left
them
outside
well
said
the
head
no
sir
said
he
i
couldn
t
find
any
and
his
eye
fell
almost
respectfully
on
the
appalling
pile
already
found
thanks
said
the
head
i
am
glad
please
take
the
lesson
he
instantly
resumed
thucydides
gregson
read
and
translate
he
said
poor
plugs
at
the
end
the
head
got
up
there
is
no
need
to
speak
to
you
further
he
said
because
i
think
you
all
understand
i
may
say
however
that
any
boy
found
using
a
crib
in
the
future
will
be
flogged
and
degraded
into
the
fourth
form
you
will
find
it
unwise
to
try
at
least
i
think
he
gathered
up
his
gown
and
for
the
first
time
apparently
saw
the
heap
of
books
piled
in
front
of
his
desk
the
lowest
six
boys
of
the
form
will
bring
those
silly
volumes
across
to
my
house
he
said
the
head
boy
will
count
them
here
and
then
come
across
when
they
are
all
removed
and
count
them
again
to
see
that
the
numbers
tally
you
understand
blaize
yes
sir
said
david
and
i
am
ashamed
of
you
all
said
the
head
chapter
x
david
s
soft
grey
hat
with
on
it
was
tilted
over
his
eyes
to
screen
them
from
the
sun
and
he
lay
full
length
on
the
hot
dry
sand
above
mark
on
the
beach
at
naseby
stupefied
and
simmering
with
content
his
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
in
shirt
sleeves
were
extended
and
he
kept
filling
his
hands
with
sand
and
letting
it
ooze
out
again
through
the
interstices
of
his
fingers
in
a
pleasant
tickling
manner
hourglass
fashion
though
the
action
evoked
in
him
neither
edifying
nor
melancholy
reflection
on
the
subject
of
the
passing
of
time
beside
him
lay
two
coats
and
two
bags
of
for
he
and
maddox
with
whom
he
was
staying
had
just
come
back
from
a
morning
round
of
golf
and
had
gone
down
to
the
shore
to
bathe
before
lunch
they
had
tossed
up
as
to
which
of
them
should
go
to
fetch
towels
and
maddox
having
lost
had
just
disappeared
up
the
steep
crumbling
path
that
led
to
the
top
of
the
where
was
perched
the
house
his
mother
usually
took
for
the
summer
holidays
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
north
these
cliffs
broke
into
tumbled
and
stretches
of
short
velvety
turf
where
greens
nestled
in
elysian
valleys
surrounded
by
saharas
maddox
would
be
absent
some
ten
minutes
and
david
let
his
lazy
thoughts
float
down
the
stream
of
the
very
pleasant
thinkings
which
made
up
his
extreme
contentment
he
did
not
direct
them
but
let
them
drift
going
swiftly
here
eddying
round
there
while
the
of
the
last
few
months
glided
by
in
the
first
place
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
he
was
staying
here
with
his
was
an
eddy
he
went
round
and
round
in
it
though
he
had
been
here
three
days
already
passing
them
entirely
with
maddox
playing
golf
with
him
playing
tennis
with
him
bathing
with
him
and
quite
continuously
talking
to
him
david
could
not
get
used
to
this
amazing
situation
he
called
him
frank
too
just
as
if
he
was
nobody
in
particular
and
at
the
thought
of
it
david
rolled
over
on
to
his
side
wriggling
and
said
lord
it
was
but
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
that
he
had
been
in
his
own
phrase
a
scruggy
little
devil
with
capable
it
is
true
of
and
able
to
recognise
a
hero
when
he
saw
him
for
had
not
his
heart
burned
within
him
when
going
up
for
his
scholarship
examination
the
demigod
had
thrown
a
careless
word
to
him
it
was
quite
sufficient
then
that
maddox
the
handsomest
fellow
in
the
world
the
best
bat
probably
that
marchester
had
ever
produced
and
altogether
the
most
glorious
of
created
beings
should
have
noticed
him
at
all
indeed
that
was
more
than
sufficient
it
was
sufficient
that
maddox
should
exist
and
since
then
only
a
year
had
passed
and
here
he
was
calling
him
frank
and
leaning
on
his
arm
when
so
disposed
and
tossing
him
who
should
get
towels
and
staying
with
his
mother
often
she
would
say
something
to
him
in
french
unconscious
which
language
she
talked
and
frank
would
answer
in
french
which
seemed
wonderfully
romantic
though
their
ages
were
so
diverse
for
frank
was
eighteen
and
david
fifteen
and
three
years
when
the
combined
total
is
so
small
make
a
vast
difference
here
staying
with
him
david
hardly
felt
the
gap
at
school
it
was
otherwise
a
hundred
seasons
sundered
them
but
here
they
were
equal
all
difference
was
swallowed
up
in
friendship
friendship
even
swallowed
up
sometimes
david
dwelled
gluttonously
on
the
steps
that
had
led
up
to
this
there
was
that
meeting
at
baxminster
with
the
splendid
adventure
of
the
second
edition
of
keats
and
here
he
made
an
agitated
excursion
into
the
fate
of
that
he
and
margery
had
decided
to
sell
it
and
had
got
the
enormous
sum
of
twelve
not
ten
pounds
for
it
but
the
glory
of
that
had
been
abruptly
extinguished
for
their
father
had
insisted
that
their
equal
shares
should
be
invested
in
the
savings
bank
to
roll
up
at
some
beggarly
rate
of
interest
and
do
no
good
to
anybody
really
people
were
beyond
words
he
dismissed
this
distressing
topic
and
hitched
on
to
maddox
again
life
began
with
his
installation
as
fag
and
there
had
soared
like
a
flame
day
by
day
until
that
afternoon
when
after
playing
squash
with
bags
in
the
rain
he
had
gone
back
to
the
house
for
a
bath
david
had
always
avoided
the
thought
of
that
it
remained
a
moment
quite
sundered
from
the
rest
of
his
intercourse
with
frank
embarrassing
and
to
be
forgotten
like
the
momentary
opening
of
a
cupboard
where
nightmare
dwelt
anyhow
it
had
been
locked
again
instantly
and
the
key
thrown
away
never
a
sound
had
again
issued
therefrom
thereafter
came
a
flood
of
jolly
things
to
swim
in
after
the
new
arrangement
in
remove
a
consequent
on
that
monumental
he
had
got
into
the
lower
fifth
at
easter
and
would
when
he
went
back
at
michaelmas
find
himself
in
the
middle
fifth
frank
had
made
him
work
with
intelligence
and
industry
as
well
though
the
distractions
of
the
had
been
frightfully
alluring
for
david
was
really
coming
on
as
a
wily
bowler
and
it
had
been
extremely
difficult
to
give
more
than
casual
attention
to
the
commentaries
of
julius
c√¶sar
when
his
inmost
mind
was
wrapped
up
in
cricket
it
was
not
hundreds
of
overs
but
thousands
of
them
that
david
delivered
in
imagination
when
he
ought
to
have
been
crossing
the
alps
with
hannibal
or
challenging
medea
s
strange
use
of
the
pluperfect
when
that
infuriated
lady
was
in
the
act
of
stabbing
her
children
but
he
had
got
his
remove
and
a
satisfactory
report
of
his
work
so
that
there
was
peace
and
joy
at
baxminster
and
his
father
sanguinely
prophesied
that
he
would
go
up
into
a
fresh
form
every
term
as
he
himself
had
done
through
the
had
come
the
most
intoxicating
possibility
namely
that
he
had
a
chance
of
getting
his
for
cricket
his
very
first
year
at
school
this
was
a
thing
nearly
unheard
of
though
of
course
maddox
had
done
it
but
he
had
been
tried
in
and
had
done
rather
well
then
that
hope
had
gone
to
the
grave
for
when
maddox
put
up
the
list
of
the
completed
his
name
did
not
appear
but
he
had
known
that
it
was
not
going
to
do
so
already
and
the
manner
of
its
exclusion
was
secretly
to
him
almost
a
greater
gratification
than
its
appearance
would
have
been
that
too
lying
on
the
hot
sand
he
turned
greedily
over
in
his
mind
licking
the
chops
of
memory
it
had
happened
thus
he
had
come
one
afternoon
into
maddox
s
study
just
before
the
final
promotions
were
made
and
maddox
opened
the
subject
david
would
you
be
fearfully
sick
if
i
didn
t
give
you
your
he
asked
abruptly
david
had
already
allowed
himself
to
hope
for
even
to
expect
them
and
the
sunshine
went
out
of
life
i
think
i
should
he
said
not
that
it
matters
a
hang
i
say
i
m
going
up
town
do
you
want
anything
no
thanks
but
just
wait
a
minute
oh
don
t
look
like
that
david
s
face
had
taken
an
expression
of
the
most
stygian
gloom
sorry
he
said
of
course
i
was
an
ass
to
hope
no
you
weren
t
said
maddox
but
i
ve
been
bothering
about
it
and
i
thought
i
d
talk
to
you
it
s
like
this
you
and
ozzy
have
about
equal
claim
and
if
we
weren
t
such
pals
i
think
i
should
toss
up
which
of
you
i
gave
colours
to
but
the
house
would
think
i
was
favouring
you
if
i
put
you
in
there
s
another
thing
too
it
s
ozzy
s
last
year
and
your
first
i
don
t
know
that
that
matters
so
much
so
if
you
find
yourself
left
out
it
ll
be
because
we
re
pals
see
david
moved
a
step
nearer
the
woe
had
gone
from
his
face
gosh
then
leave
me
out
he
said
prefer
being
left
out
if
that
s
really
asked
maddox
yes
rather
thanks
ever
so
there
had
been
no
need
for
more
than
these
jerked
telegraphic
sentences
but
david
went
up
town
treading
on
air
with
a
secret
heavenly
pride
that
was
certainly
among
the
rippingest
feelings
he
had
ever
had
he
congratulated
ozzy
with
complete
sincerity
and
here
was
frank
himself
sliding
down
the
crumbling
with
towels
frank
threw
a
towel
at
him
and
knocked
off
his
hat
mother
s
lunching
out
he
said
so
we
can
bathe
just
as
long
as
we
please
without
being
late
oh
and
she
said
to
me
need
you
s
go
away
on
saturday
i
said
i
d
ask
david
had
no
hesitation
over
this
no
of
course
i
needn
t
he
said
at
at
least
said
frank
emptying
the
sand
out
of
his
shoes
i
mean
are
you
sure
i
m
not
being
a
bore
i
should
love
to
stop
of
course
but
won
t
you
and
your
mother
get
blasted
sick
of
me
don
t
think
she
will
said
maddox
gravely
i
shall
rather
but
it
doesn
t
matter
in
fact
i
was
wondering
whether
perhaps
you
d
mind
going
on
friday
instead
of
david
laughed
that
s
a
poor
shot
at
getting
a
rise
out
of
me
he
said
absolute
failure
i
shan
t
go
away
on
friday
or
frank
just
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stifled
a
yawn
with
dreadful
versimilitude
david
gave
him
one
short
anxious
glance
and
that
wasn
t
such
a
poor
shot
after
all
said
frank
just
for
a
second
you
wondered
if
i
was
in
no
i
didn
t
said
david
promptly
and
that
s
a
lie
said
frank
david
gave
it
up
and
lay
back
on
the
sand
again
beginning
to
unbutton
i
know
it
is
he
said
you
yawned
jolly
frank
picked
up
a
handful
of
the
dry
powdery
sand
and
let
it
trickle
gently
into
the
gap
of
shin
that
showed
between
the
end
of
david
s
trousers
and
the
beginning
of
his
sock
this
caused
him
to
spring
up
lord
what
s
that
he
said
oh
i
see
funny
i
thought
it
was
a
bug
of
well
if
you
will
grow
so
that
your
trousers
only
reach
down
your
legs
what
else
is
to
be
done
with
the
intervals
asked
frank
i
grew
two
inches
last
half
said
david
i
shall
be
taller
than
you
before
i
ve
very
likely
you
will
be
the
image
of
a
piece
of
asparagus
if
you
like
that
and
certainly
if
you
grow
up
to
the
size
of
your
feet
you
ll
be
big
enough
i
shall
call
you
david
s
shirt
was
half
over
his
head
but
he
paused
and
spoke
muffled
because
why
he
asked
because
a
spondee
is
two
long
david
gave
a
great
splutter
of
laughter
as
his
shirt
came
off
oh
quite
funny
he
said
wish
i
had
guessed
jove
doesn
t
the
sea
look
good
i
m
glad
it
was
made
that
i
didn
t
die
in
the
night
you
didn
t
bring
down
anything
to
eat
did
you
isn
t
it
bad
to
bathe
on
an
empty
tummy
or
is
it
a
full
one
don
t
know
i
m
going
to
bathe
on
my
own
anyhow
david
there
s
a
sharp
line
round
your
neck
where
your
clothes
begin
when
you
ve
got
any
as
if
you
d
painted
your
neck
with
the
i
did
said
david
fatuously
standing
nude
come
on
the
ripping
old
sea
s
waiting
for
the
tide
was
high
and
the
beach
steep
so
that
a
few
steps
across
the
belt
of
sand
all
in
the
heat
and
a
few
strokes
into
the
cool
tingling
water
were
sufficient
to
snatch
them
away
from
all
solid
things
and
give
them
the
buoyancy
of
liquid
existences
the
sea
slept
in
the
windlessness
of
this
august
weather
and
as
if
with
breaths
a
silence
and
alternate
whisper
of
ripple
broke
along
its
rims
far
out
a
fleet
of
with
drooping
sails
hovered
like
gulls
above
an
unclouded
sun
shone
on
the
shining
watery
plains
and
on
the
two
wet
heads
one
black
one
yellow
that
moved
out
seawards
with
flashings
of
white
arms
clawing
the
sea
amid
a
smother
of
foam
farther
and
farther
they
moved
out
till
at
last
david
rolled
over
in
the
water
and
floated
on
his
back
oh
ripping
he
said
good
old
mother
sea
frank
turned
over
also
and
lay
alongside
it
s
like
something
i
read
yesterday
he
said
as
the
heart
of
something
and
for
the
i
seem
to
remember
it
well
don
t
i
yes
what
is
it
anyhow
who
did
it
fellow
called
swinburne
good
man
is
swinburne
at
times
lord
you
can
lie
down
on
the
sea
like
a
sofa
if
you
get
your
balance
right
oh
dear
me
yes
swinburne
knows
a
trick
or
two
for
instance
when
the
hounds
of
spring
are
on
winter
s
traces
the
mother
of
months
in
meadow
and
plain
fills
the
shadows
and
windy
places
with
lisp
of
leaves
and
ripple
of
rain
and
the
bright
brown
nightingale
how
does
it
go
he
lay
with
head
and
eyes
half
closed
against
the
glare
and
the
spell
of
the
magical
words
framed
itself
more
distinctly
in
his
mind
o
listen
david
he
said
drink
it
in
for
winter
s
rains
and
ruins
are
over
and
all
the
season
of
snows
and
sins
the
day
dividing
lover
and
lover
the
light
that
loses
the
night
that
wins
and
time
remembered
is
grief
forgotten
and
frosts
are
slain
and
flowers
begotten
and
in
green
underwood
and
cover
blossom
by
blossom
the
spring
david
would
have
appreciated
this
in
any
case
but
never
had
any
poem
so
romantic
a
setting
as
when
frank
repeated
it
to
him
here
as
they
lay
side
by
side
right
out
away
from
land
away
from
anything
but
each
other
and
this
liquid
paradise
of
living
water
he
said
rapturously
and
what
s
the
name
of
it
go
on
frank
thought
a
moment
can
t
remember
the
next
verse
he
said
but
it
s
atalanta
in
oh
she
s
the
chap
that
went
out
hunting
with
her
maidens
said
david
confidently
she
is
look
out
there
s
a
all
right
it
s
floating
by
i
say
the
water
s
as
warm
don
t
i
think
you
re
babbling
said
david
go
on
about
atalanta
did
she
have
good
sport
maddox
laughed
forgetting
that
he
was
balanced
in
a
briny
sea
and
swallowed
a
large
quantity
of
it
what
s
the
row
asked
david
what
did
i
say
maddox
ejected
as
much
of
the
water
as
was
accessible
oh
you
are
such
a
kid
he
said
and
i
keep
forgetting
david
kicked
himself
into
a
perpendicular
position
and
trod
water
well
i
m
getting
older
as
quick
as
i
can
he
said
in
blast
i
wish
it
could
go
on
for
what
as
if
you
didn
t
know
being
in
the
sea
and
being
with
you
and
being
alive
and
so
same
here
said
frank
lord
but
i
wish
i
could
the
sea
as
rather
jam
but
i
don
t
think
i
d
allow
everybody
to
bathe
in
me
said
david
dogs
yes
and
some
people
not
all
or
should
we
charge
a
shilling
and
let
anybody
maddox
pushed
himself
upright
in
the
water
fraid
we
ought
to
come
out
he
said
it
must
be
latish
i
ll
race
you
to
right
oh
give
me
twenty
yards
measure
them
very
carefully
said
frank
well
twenty
strokes
then
said
the
wily
david
shoving
from
frank
s
shoulder
to
get
a
movement
on
and
then
taking
very
long
slow
strokes
letting
his
impetus
exhaust
itself
now
he
said
both
boys
swam
with
the
overhand
breathing
whenever
their
heads
happened
to
be
above
water
and
ploughed
landwards
with
waves
of
bubble
and
broken
water
behind
them
frank
overtook
the
other
in
the
last
thrilling
ten
yards
won
by
the
length
of
an
arm
and
a
head
and
panting
but
still
cool
they
lay
for
a
little
in
the
shallow
water
and
then
reluctantly
went
up
over
the
beach
to
where
their
clothes
lay
there
the
hot
sun
soon
rendered
superfluous
the
towels
frank
had
been
at
pains
to
fetch
and
presently
after
they
laboured
up
the
sandy
path
to
the
house
slack
and
hungry
and
content
with
the
half
of
the
wonderful
day
still
in
front
of
them
once
on
the
upward
ascent
david
paused
his
mind
going
back
to
the
magic
of
words
he
said
again
rapturously
blossom
by
blossom
the
spring
i
shall
read
some
more
of
that
after
lunch
took
a
considerable
time
for
david
s
appetite
like
his
bones
and
muscles
seemed
but
to
grow
larger
with
the
food
he
ate
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
taken
frank
s
evil
advice
and
drunk
a
second
bottle
of
that
he
declared
himself
able
to
turn
his
attention
to
literature
again
they
were
going
to
play
golf
once
more
in
half
an
hour
and
david
staggered
out
on
to
the
lawn
to
lie
on
the
shady
for
a
short
spell
of
swinburne
which
frank
went
to
fetch
from
his
bedroom
letters
had
arrived
during
lunch
and
he
found
one
for
himself
and
one
for
david
which
with
swinburne
and
the
daily
paper
that
would
contain
one
important
matter
namely
the
result
of
the
county
match
between
sussex
and
surrey
he
took
out
with
him
there
s
a
letter
for
you
he
said
and
there
s
swinburne
and
the
what
order
of
merit
oh
first
said
david
i
bet
you
that
this
letter
s
from
margery
might
just
see
what
s
going
on
i
say
i
know
exactly
how
a
balloon
feels
but
it
was
jolly
good
frank
flopped
down
on
the
bank
by
him
and
began
opening
his
letter
what
else
do
you
expect
he
said
if
you
inflate
yourself
with
gas
as
you
did
at
lunch
don
t
expect
anything
else
said
david
thickly
and
it
was
you
who
suggested
it
i
think
i
must
see
what
happened
in
the
match
well
let
s
have
a
look
too
you
selfish
devil
said
maddox
putting
down
his
letter
can
t
you
turn
over
and
put
the
paper
on
the
grass
here
so
that
we
can
read
it
together
lord
no
said
david
at
least
it
d
be
a
risk
but
i
can
sit
up
if
i
do
it
sussex
which
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
david
s
county
and
for
which
he
felt
rather
responsible
had
done
him
credit
on
this
occasion
and
had
won
by
half
a
dozen
wickets
the
rest
of
the
paper
did
not
seem
to
contain
anything
that
mattered
and
throwing
it
aside
he
and
frank
began
on
their
letters
margery
s
was
quite
short
though
good
of
its
kind
and
having
finished
it
david
looked
up
and
saw
that
frank
was
reading
his
and
that
there
was
trouble
in
his
face
oh
i
say
is
anything
wrong
he
asked
frank
did
not
reply
at
once
i
ve
heard
from
adams
he
said
at
length
there
s
been
a
row
some
letter
has
been
found
and
hughes
isn
t
to
be
allowed
to
come
back
in
why
what
sort
of
letter
asked
david
then
as
frank
was
still
silent
oh
something
beastly
is
it
he
asked
what
an
ass
hughes
is
he
was
such
a
nice
chap
too
at
my
other
frank
had
finished
reading
and
was
looking
out
over
the
surrey
garden
biting
his
lip
i
say
frank
what
s
wrong
with
you
said
david
frank
gave
adams
s
letter
to
him
read
it
he
said
david
took
it
it
spoke
of
the
letter
written
by
hughes
to
a
boy
in
the
house
a
letter
disgusting
and
conclusive
then
it
spoke
of
the
disgrace
hughes
had
brought
on
himself
and
the
misery
he
had
brought
on
his
father
and
mother
he
read
it
and
gave
it
back
to
frank
well
i
m
awfully
sorry
just
as
you
are
he
said
but
if
fellows
will
be
adams
seems
no
end
cut
up
about
it
but
somehow
i
d
ceased
to
be
pals
with
hughes
where
s
the
swinburne
but
still
frank
did
not
answer
and
david
knitted
puzzled
brows
what
s
up
he
said
maddox
turned
over
on
to
his
back
and
tilted
his
hat
over
his
eyes
till
his
face
was
invisible
i
might
have
been
hughes
he
said
again
the
memory
of
what
david
always
turned
his
face
from
came
into
his
mind
oh
rot
he
said
lamely
hating
the
subject
maddox
was
silent
a
moment
tisn
t
quite
rot
he
said
but
then
there
came
a
thing
which
i
dare
say
you
ve
forgotten
only
i
haven
t
you
came
in
from
playing
squash
one
wet
afternoon
and
you
and
your
innocence
made
me
suddenly
see
what
a
beast
i
david
could
not
help
giving
a
little
shudder
but
the
moment
after
he
was
ashamed
of
it
i
don
t
care
what
you
were
like
before
he
said
but
what
i
m
perfectly
sure
of
is
that
since
remember
it
very
ve
been
all
there
you
are
then
said
david
frank
was
still
lying
with
his
hat
over
his
face
but
now
he
pushed
it
back
and
looked
at
david
it
s
all
serene
for
you
he
said
because
you
ve
always
been
a
straight
chap
but
it
s
different
for
me
i
feel
just
david
scratched
his
head
in
some
perplexity
the
whole
matter
was
vague
and
repugnant
to
him
and
he
did
not
want
to
hear
more
or
know
more
there
were
such
heaps
of
jolly
proper
things
in
the
world
to
be
interested
in
and
curious
about
but
he
understood
without
any
vagueness
at
all
and
with
the
very
opposite
of
repulsion
that
his
friend
was
in
trouble
and
that
he
wanted
sympathy
with
that
so
the
whole
of
his
devoted
little
heart
went
out
there
it
was
bad
trouble
too
the
worst
trouble
a
fellow
could
have
it
must
be
perfectly
beastly
for
you
he
said
and
i
m
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
but
you
re
sorry
yourself
and
what
more
can
a
chap
do
if
you
weren
t
sorry
it
would
be
different
there
s
another
thing
too
to
set
against
what
you
ve
done
and
that
s
how
you
ve
behaved
to
me
you
ve
been
an
absolute
brick
to
me
you
ve
kept
that
sort
of
filth
away
from
me
i
know
you
david
paused
for
a
moment
this
morning
alone
on
the
hot
beach
his
mind
had
dwelt
long
and
eagerly
on
this
wonderful
friendship
and
now
just
when
it
was
the
very
thing
that
was
wanted
to
comfort
frank
this
aspect
of
it
struck
him
he
remembered
how
often
frank
had
by
a
seemingly
chance
word
discouraged
him
from
seeing
much
of
certain
fellows
in
the
house
he
remembered
the
night
when
hughes
came
and
sat
on
his
bed
and
with
what
extraordinary
promptitude
frank
had
ejected
him
he
remembered
how
his
dormitory
had
been
changed
and
he
had
been
put
in
frank
s
and
had
since
then
slept
in
the
bed
next
him
all
this
with
swift
certainty
started
into
his
mind
and
with
it
the
policy
that
lay
behind
it
frank
had
consistently
kept
nasty
things
away
from
him
here
was
his
atonement
so
he
went
on
eagerly
i
know
what
you
ve
done
for
me
he
said
you
ve
an
eye
on
me
and
kept
filth
away
i
m
no
end
grateful
and
since
you
ve
done
that
chalk
it
up
on
the
other
side
you
ve
made
it
easier
for
me
to
be
decent
oh
damn
i
m
david
suddenly
became
aware
of
this
and
stopped
abruptly
rolling
over
on
to
his
side
with
his
face
to
his
friend
haven
t
you
been
doing
that
on
purpose
he
demanded
i
could
give
you
heaps
of
well
then
let
s
chuck
the
whole
subject
said
david
in
a
moment
i
just
want
to
tell
you
i
tried
instead
of
corrupting
you
to
uncorrupt
myself
but
you
did
it
it
was
all
your
doing
you
made
me
david
gave
a
shy
little
wriggle
towards
him
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
ripping
he
said
though
it
sounds
rather
maddox
sat
up
that
s
what
you
ve
done
he
said
and
if
it
was
cheeky
the
other
name
of
that
is
there
was
silence
a
moment
and
probably
david
had
never
known
such
intense
happiness
as
he
tasted
then
and
just
because
he
was
feeling
so
deeply
the
idea
of
anything
approaching
sentiment
was
impossible
it
had
been
said
and
the
harvest
was
garnered
frank
felt
that
too
they
could
not
feel
differently
from
each
other
just
then
and
away
went
the
whole
subject
a
mountain
a
few
minutes
ago
and
now
light
as
thistledown
on
a
summer
wind
it
s
done
he
said
oh
what
was
the
other
thing
we
brought
out
atalanta
in
calydon
wasn
t
it
first
yes
that
would
be
ripping
said
david
at
the
same
time
it
s
just
struck
three
and
we
were
to
play
golf
at
jove
so
we
were
how
you
must
have
jawed
for
one
second
david
was
not
quite
certain
whether
frank
was
trying
to
get
a
rise
out
of
him
or
not
with
such
naturalness
did
he
speak
sorry
he
said
quickly
i
m
afraid
i
frank
laughed
david
it
s
no
sport
trying
to
get
a
rise
out
of
you
he
said
you
simply
rise
at
anything
i
really
didn
t
think
you
d
rise
at
oh
all
right
said
david
then
it
was
a
nice
surprise
for
you
come
on
if
you
ll
give
me
a
stroke
hole
i
ll
probably
get
beaten
he
added
in
a
sudden
accession
of
modesty
most
unusual
i
say
what
a
ripping
day
it
s
tain
t
bad
and
you
re
not
such
a
bad
little
this
bordered
on
past
conversation
again
and
he
hastened
away
from
it
go
and
get
our
clubs
david
he
said
i
lost
the
toss
about
the
towels
this
that
s
not
fair
said
david
we
tossed
this
morning
and
that
s
finished
we
ll
toss
again
heads
well
then
it
isn
t
it
s
tails
but
i
ll
go
if
you
like
it
was
still
very
hot
and
the
links
although
the
usual
august
crowd
was
at
naseby
were
nearly
deserted
since
it
seemed
to
most
of
the
world
to
be
the
better
part
of
wisdom
to
sit
quiet
till
the
heat
had
a
little
abated
and
resume
activities
again
after
tea
the
two
boys
therefore
had
an
empty
green
before
them
and
since
finance
in
both
their
cases
happened
to
be
precarious
and
there
was
no
need
to
keep
their
places
on
the
green
they
took
no
caddies
on
the
right
along
the
first
hole
lay
the
sea
shimmering
and
still
so
near
that
it
was
easily
possible
to
say
the
least
of
it
to
slice
a
ball
on
to
the
beach
and
in
front
lay
the
fairway
of
the
course
stretches
of
velvet
grass
interrupted
by
tossing
seas
of
fringed
and
bearded
with
coarse
bents
while
a
flag
planted
thereon
showed
where
lay
the
direction
of
the
desired
haven
then
came
trudges
through
sandy
places
with
breathless
suspense
to
see
whether
the
balls
had
carried
the
last
of
the
bunkers
and
in
other
cases
the
equally
vivid
conviction
that
they
had
done
nothing
of
the
sort
and
would
be
found
nestling
in
little
steep
bare
hollows
and
david
in
especial
found
himself
frequently
in
amazing
and
awful
places
of
which
satan
had
certainly
been
the
architect
but
in
spite
of
the
intimate
nature
of
all
that
had
passed
between
the
two
so
few
minutes
before
their
unbroken
solitude
together
did
not
produce
in
either
of
them
the
least
wish
to
the
subject
it
had
been
closed
a
door
had
been
triumphantly
slammed
on
it
so
that
even
if
golf
had
not
been
so
absorbing
they
would
neither
of
them
have
mentioned
it
again
and
yet
deep
down
in
each
and
unknown
to
them
all
that
had
passed
had
taken
root
and
was
silently
germinating
making
fibre
in
their
unconscious
minds
building
up
the
stem
on
which
character
bursts
into
blossom
many
words
were
consciously
spoken
and
many
thoughts
thought
and
all
the
words
and
all
the
thoughts
did
not
stray
beyond
the
fortunes
of
the
little
white
balls
at
marchester
golf
was
a
recognised
school
game
played
on
their
own
links
for
the
two
winter
halves
when
it
did
not
interfere
with
cricket
and
was
just
like
him
so
thought
become
a
fine
player
with
really
no
trouble
at
all
he
had
only
played
for
two
years
but
at
school
he
was
a
scratch
player
and
here
at
naseby
had
just
won
a
medal
prize
starting
from
four
he
confessed
that
it
had
come
easy
to
him
everything
seemed
to
and
to
david
s
observant
eye
he
did
not
seem
to
do
anything
particular
that
caused
him
not
to
top
one
drive
and
send
the
next
spouting
in
the
air
like
a
geyser
when
it
came
to
approaching
it
was
with
the
same
supple
ease
that
he
flicked
the
ball
high
with
a
little
fid
of
turf
flying
after
it
it
all
appeared
so
perfectly
simple
you
merely
hit
the
ball
with
the
middle
of
the
club
at
times
if
you
were
playing
against
him
the
thing
became
almost
monotonous
whatever
could
be
said
about
david
s
play
it
could
not
be
called
monotonous
he
gave
an
excellent
example
of
his
methods
this
afternoon
at
the
third
hole
slicing
far
and
gorgeously
from
the
tee
out
on
to
the
sand
there
had
been
no
interest
in
frank
s
drive
it
had
merely
gone
straight
and
a
very
long
way
and
so
he
came
with
david
to
walk
up
his
ball
which
was
found
to
be
lying
fairly
well
silly
ass
he
said
to
him
as
david
took
out
an
iron
and
prepared
to
play
with
it
take
your
niblick
and
make
certain
of
getting
back
on
to
but
i
could
get
on
to
the
green
with
an
iron
if
i
hit
it
said
david
excitedly
and
then
i
should
be
there
in
two
and
you
can
t
get
them
in
less
than
two
and
i
ve
got
a
stroke
and
should
win
the
hole
off
you
if
i
putted
my
first
near
right
oh
said
frank
never
mind
the
not
an
atom
said
david
the
ball
was
not
lying
so
very
badly
and
there
was
really
a
certain
excuse
for
david
so
he
took
his
iron
and
hit
the
ball
rather
firmly
on
the
head
it
went
about
fifteen
yards
in
an
injured
manner
and
settled
itself
in
the
moat
of
what
had
been
a
child
s
and
it
ll
take
the
deuce
of
a
putt
to
get
near
the
hole
from
there
remarked
frank
david
as
always
took
his
game
very
seriously
and
for
a
moment
felt
merely
wild
with
rage
impotent
ineffective
rage
nobody
cared
he
began
then
his
admirable
temper
asserted
itself
before
he
settled
what
hell
was
going
to
do
oh
dear
you
re
always
right
frank
he
said
niblick
it
is
and
i
wish
it
had
been
before
now
i
m
going
to
take
he
shifted
with
his
feet
in
the
loose
sand
as
frank
had
told
him
to
do
till
he
got
a
firm
stance
then
which
frank
had
never
told
him
to
do
he
took
the
most
prodigious
wipe
at
his
ball
and
shut
his
eyes
as
the
sand
fell
in
showers
round
him
didn
t
see
it
he
said
what
happened
somehow
or
other
he
had
hit
the
ball
clean
and
hard
and
perfectly
straight
for
the
green
it
wasn
t
a
niblick
shot
at
all
nobody
david
least
of
all
knew
how
it
had
happened
well
of
all
the
almighty
flukes
said
frank
probably
on
the
david
bubbled
with
laughter
oh
i
say
what
sport
he
said
now
i
know
how
to
play
golf
if
you
lie
rather
badly
take
an
iron
and
make
it
worse
then
take
a
niblick
and
hit
it
they
went
back
to
the
course
to
walk
up
frank
s
ball
it
was
lying
impeccably
twenty
yards
short
of
the
bunker
that
guarded
the
green
and
for
once
he
was
not
monotonous
he
chipped
at
it
with
a
lot
of
and
it
bounced
against
the
boards
of
the
bunker
and
fell
at
their
feet
thereafter
he
played
racquets
against
the
boards
then
he
gave
it
up
and
david
the
reckless
and
unreasonable
was
lying
just
a
foot
beyond
the
bunkers
in
such
wise
the
hot
heavenly
afternoon
went
by
dreadful
and
delightful
things
happened
frank
after
long
consideration
as
to
whether
he
could
get
over
the
brook
with
a
drive
at
the
tenth
hole
decided
to
play
short
with
a
cleek
and
pitched
full
into
it
david
with
two
strokes
in
hand
putted
four
times
at
the
eleventh
before
he
got
down
and
both
of
them
trying
to
carry
the
far
bunker
at
the
thirteenth
topped
into
the
near
one
instead
but
there
were
delightful
incidents
to
balance
these
distressing
ones
frank
holed
a
mashie
shot
at
the
sixteenth
and
at
the
next
david
ran
through
two
not
one
bunkers
off
a
topped
drive
and
a
third
with
his
second
shot
but
deep
down
below
the
basis
of
their
enjoyment
was
their
friendship
and
neither
thought
how
easily
that
priceless
possession
might
have
foundered
and
been
lost
in
quagmires
frank
won
a
wholly
loathsome
putt
on
the
last
green
which
went
into
the
hole
not
by
the
honest
nor
even
with
a
kick
at
the
honest
back
door
but
with
a
stealthy
sideway
entrance
after
circling
round
the
hole
decided
the
match
oh
good
putt
said
david
politely
and
instantly
the
politeness
broke
down
gosh
what
a
fluke
he
added
rot
i
tried
to
hole
it
and
did
said
frank
well
i
said
good
putt
once
said
david
and
i
can
t
say
it
again
simply
can
after
tea
at
the
it
seemed
a
necessity
to
play
again
and
this
time
regardless
of
financial
stringency
frank
treated
david
to
a
caddy
and
they
went
forth
with
pomp
now
playing
seawards
into
the
hazy
east
now
westwards
into
the
blaze
of
the
declining
sun
absorbed
in
their
game
and
yet
absorbed
in
their
friendship
of
hot
as
fire
and
clean
as
the
trickle
of
on
a
glacier
the
knowledge
of
their
talk
had
made
frank
able
to
turn
himself
away
from
all
the
bad
business
of
adams
s
letter
and
instead
of
brooding
on
the
irremediable
worst
of
himself
he
took
hold
of
all
that
was
best
and
by
his
side
was
david
the
friend
of
friends
now
with
his
arm
linked
in
his
now
excitedly
addressing
a
cupped
ball
with
his
largest
driver
now
brilliantly
slicing
among
untrodden
now
dancing
with
exultation
at
the
success
of
a
shot
that
was
wholly
beyond
expectation
now
half
whispering
to
him
oh
it
s
the
rippingest
then
followed
till
it
was
so
dark
that
the
ball
could
hardly
be
seen
at
all
and
in
consequence
david
standing
at
the
net
got
hit
full
on
the
end
of
his
nose
which
bled
with
extraordinary
profusion
indeed
had
murder
been
committed
that
night
at
naseby
as
frank
said
when
they
went
down
for
a
hurried
dip
before
dressing
for
dinner
it
would
have
required
no
sherlock
holmes
to
draw
the
certain
but
quite
erroneous
conclusion
that
the
deed
had
been
done
in
david
s
bedroom
and
the
body
carried
down
to
the
beach
afterwards
with
the
idea
of
its
being
taken
away
and
out
by
the
ebbing
tide
and
the
seaward
current
a
with
water
analysed
by
professor
pepper
and
found
to
be
mammalian
would
be
discovered
in
his
bedroom
and
at
intervals
down
the
path
to
the
beach
further
traces
of
the
same
incriminating
gore
the
cool
put
an
end
to
david
s
bleeding
and
as
he
dressed
he
began
to
feel
delightfully
uncomfortable
as
in
the
attics
of
baxminster
so
grimly
and
gravely
did
frank
reconstruct
the
history
of
the
crime
with
fearful
imaginative
details
thrown
in
a
little
way
from
them
on
the
beach
was
something
vague
and
black
and
humped
up
and
frank
suddenly
pointed
at
it
do
you
know
what
that
is
he
asked
david
in
a
whisper
that
black
thing
no
what
it
s
the
body
said
frank
of
course
this
was
all
nonsense
but
david
peered
at
it
through
the
gloom
and
frank
suddenly
gave
a
deep
and
hollow
groan
which
startled
him
quite
awfully
it
wasn
t
utterly
dead
he
explained
it
tried
to
call
for
help
but
it
couldn
t
call
loud
as
its
throat
was
cut
from
ear
to
ear
but
it
just
groaned
the
body
was
that
of
a
boy
of
fifteen
tall
for
his
age
david
and
well
david
could
not
help
it
he
had
to
run
in
his
bare
feet
to
where
the
supposed
corpse
lay
kicked
it
and
came
back
only
seaweed
he
said
now
the
murderer
did
it
in
my
room
you
say
i
mean
he
cut
the
boy
s
throat
there
and
then
carried
it
down
to
the
beach
that
won
t
do
there
are
only
quite
a
few
drops
of
blood
on
the
way
down
if
its
throat
had
been
cut
from
ear
to
ear
there
d
be
more
not
at
all
said
frank
the
murderer
held
the
two
edges
of
the
wound
he
d
want
both
hands
to
carry
the
pinned
the
edges
of
the
wound
together
safety
pins
so
that
it
only
just
leaked
he
carried
it
down
to
the
beach
like
that
and
then
took
out
the
pins
because
he
had
a
saving
disposition
and
this
let
the
boy
bleed
to
death
as
i
said
he
thought
the
tide
would
carry
it
away
but
it
didn
t
and
it
was
found
there
next
morning
lobsters
had
got
at
it
though
and
howked
pieces
out
of
it
there
s
lobster
for
dinner
then
the
police
traced
the
bloodstains
to
your
bedroom
and
found
the
and
you
were
kept
in
prison
till
you
were
sixteen
and
then
hung
at
and
what
did
don
t
know
which
i
am
the
corpse
or
the
you
re
both
said
frank
the
pins
they
were
put
back
in
the
on
your
where
i
saw
them
just
now
there
were
stains
on
them
that
looked
like
rust
but
they
weren
t
rust
they
they
were
blood
said
david
frank
looked
hastily
round
for
more
material
for
horror
and
saw
a
fisherman
coming
down
the
steep
path
just
behind
them
carrying
two
this
was
luck
for
david
had
not
seen
him
being
employed
in
putting
his
shoes
on
frank
went
on
without
pause
after
that
the
beach
at
naseby
he
said
was
not
a
place
where
prudent
people
cared
to
be
after
sunset
especially
during
the
month
of
august
and
particularly
august
the
tenth
which
was
the
exact
day
when
the
murder
was
committed
prudent
people
avoided
it
for
there
was
no
doubt
it
was
haunted
a
figure
was
often
seen
coming
down
that
steep
path
just
behind
us
carrying
a
ghastly
david
looked
quickly
round
with
the
intention
of
reassuring
himself
that
there
was
no
one
there
that
was
a
dreadful
mistake
there
was
frank
after
his
one
glance
at
the
figure
had
not
looked
at
the
path
again
good
lord
said
david
in
a
whisper
there
s
something
coming
down
it
now
it
s
coming
straight
towards
us
then
he
saw
more
distinctly
and
gave
a
great
cackle
of
laughter
it
s
only
a
fisherman
with
he
said
but
you
did
give
me
such
a
turn
you
said
that
awfully
well
when
i
looked
round
and
saw
that
old
buffer
coming
down
i
could
have
screamed
i
say
do
lobsters
really
eat
deaders
whenever
they
can
get
them
there
are
a
good
many
about
now
too
the
cook
told
me
that
the
one
we
re
going
to
have
for
dinner
had
a
man
s
finger
in
its
claws
when
they
brought
it
up
to
the
house
the
best
oh
dry
up
shouted
david
you
ve
a
foul
frank
laughed
oh
you
kid
nor
was
the
immortal
day
over
yet
the
lobster
was
in
turn
eaten
by
man
and
after
dinner
frank
read
to
his
mother
and
david
the
neglected
atalanta
after
which
they
played
ridiculous
games
till
bedtime
frank
s
room
and
david
s
communicated
with
each
other
and
as
they
undressed
further
details
and
embellishments
of
horror
were
added
to
the
murder
story
through
the
open
door
but
to
one
of
frank
s
most
gruesome
inventions
there
had
been
no
response
and
looking
in
he
saw
that
david
was
kneeling
by
his
bed
and
at
that
he
went
back
to
his
room
again
the
silence
was
not
of
long
duration
and
in
a
moment
david
called
to
him
what
was
that
last
frank
he
said
it
sounded
jolly
beastly
but
i
wasn
t
frank
repeated
it
and
david
squealed
as
he
drew
his
up
to
his
chin
i
think
that
s
enough
he
said
i
shall
have
gory
nightmares
oh
hasn
t
it
been
a
jolly
day
ripping
good
night
good
night
what
a
pity
it
can
t
be
this
morning
frank
lay
long
awake
that
night
before
he
slept
he
slid
out
of
bed
and
followed
david
s
example
chapter
xi
david
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
stuck
out
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
was
engaged
in
the
delicate
and
apparently
until
you
know
the
reason
meaningless
task
of
lashing
two
pens
together
with
a
piece
of
cotton
so
that
their
respective
nibs
should
be
fixed
at
a
particular
distance
apart
from
each
other
the
distance
as
he
took
pains
to
measure
accurately
was
exactly
that
between
the
first
and
fourth
line
on
a
piece
of
scribbling
paper
if
this
is
neatly
david
with
his
deft
fingers
was
doing
it
very
neatly
will
be
clear
that
if
both
pens
are
dipped
in
ink
and
one
writes
certain
words
along
the
first
line
of
the
paper
the
second
pen
duly
adjusted
will
simultaneously
be
writing
the
same
words
along
the
fourth
line
similarly
when
the
first
pen
is
engaged
in
the
second
line
the
other
will
be
engaged
on
the
fifth
thus
provided
the
pens
are
securely
lashed
and
behave
reasonably
a
sheet
of
scribbling
paper
of
the
sort
that
holds
twenty
lines
can
be
filled
with
hexameters
from
any
given
part
of
the
highly
adventures
of
the
pious
√¶neas
in
the
time
that
without
this
contrivance
it
would
take
to
transcribe
ten
of
those
lines
any
boy
moreover
and
such
adults
as
still
preserve
a
brain
of
moderate
ingenuity
will
easily
guess
why
those
pens
in
david
s
very
superior
contraption
were
lashed
together
at
a
distance
of
three
lines
for
were
they
lashed
together
at
the
distance
of
one
or
even
two
lines
apart
this
engaging
scheme
by
which
two
lines
were
written
simultaneously
would
be
much
more
easily
detected
as
david
had
to
write
out
no
fewer
than
five
hundred
lines
of
this
piffling
√¶neid
he
thus
hoped
to
be
quit
of
his
task
in
the
time
that
it
would
take
a
less
ingenious
devil
to
write
two
hundred
and
fifty
it
was
already
getting
dark
at
the
close
of
a
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
february
and
bags
while
david
was
engaged
in
these
preparatory
processes
was
making
tea
for
them
both
in
the
study
they
shared
together
it
was
a
considerably
larger
one
than
that
which
they
had
inhabited
during
their
first
year
but
david
s
belongings
seemed
to
have
grown
proportionately
to
his
own
limbs
and
they
still
usurped
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
the
available
room
his
task
though
tiresome
was
not
one
that
required
much
concentration
of
attention
it
was
mere
dull
transcribing
work
and
he
could
quite
well
converse
as
it
was
going
on
besides
it
was
a
very
short
time
since
he
had
copied
out
these
same
pages
before
he
had
a
certain
familiarity
with
them
he
finished
adjusting
the
pens
found
that
he
had
got
their
distance
to
a
nicety
and
gripping
them
on
the
place
where
their
handles
crossed
he
dipped
them
in
the
ink
then
as
a
refinement
of
ingenious
engineering
he
took
bags
s
inkpot
and
put
it
in
such
a
place
that
the
two
pens
were
dipped
simultaneously
infandum
regina
jubes
he
said
what
an
awful
gasser
√¶neas
was
he
talked
straight
off
for
two
books
and
i
suppose
dido
didn
t
go
to
sleep
cause
she
was
so
mad
keen
on
him
why
can
t
i
copy
out
something
decent
like
keats
or
swinburne
instead
of
this
mouldy
old
johnny
i
should
really
rather
like
perhaps
that
s
why
they
don
t
let
you
said
bags
giving
him
a
cup
of
tea
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
was
thanks
awfully
bags
did
you
put
four
lumps
of
sugar
in
oh
then
two
more
please
but
as
regards
the
patent
pen
of
course
there
is
a
certain
risk
that
owlers
this
of
course
was
howliss
will
spot
it
and
i
shall
have
to
do
it
again
but
it
ain
t
likely
three
lines
apart
great
security
in
three
lines
you
ve
spent
most
of
your
time
this
half
writing

i
know
i
don
t
seem
to
be
able
to
keep
out

rows
i
don
t
want
to
be

or
cut

or
go
out

but
i
don

seem
to
be
able
to
help
it
adams
jawed
me
this
morning
said
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
me
and
i
m
sure
i
couldn
t
tell
him
maddox
is
rather
sick
with
me
too
which
matters
more
says
i
play
the
goat
too
much
and
he
doesn
t
know
about
the
seal
and
this
last
impot
yet
i
shall
have
to
tell
him
though
it
s
the
best
rag
i
ve
had
yet
yes
more
tea
i
think
you
re
rather
an
ass
unless
you
prefer
writing
out
the
√¶neid
to
any
other
ploy
said
bags
i
dare
say
but
i
can
t
help
it
i
simply
can
t
i
should
never
have
gone
to
that
silly
old
fair
up
town
last
week
if
they
hadn
t
put
it
out
of
bounds
but
when
they
put
it
out
of
bounds
i
had
to
go
it
wasn
t
because
i
wanted
to
see
the
fat
woman
and
the
skeleton
dude
if
i
take
to
smoking
which
i
haven
t
done
yet
it
won
t
be
because
i
like
it
which
i
don
t
but
just
because
it
s
against
the
rules
that
s
good
enough
for
bags
took
up
the
first
page
which
david
had
written
and
which
resembled
some
loose
sort
of
triolet
with
its
repetition
of
lines
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
managing
two
pens
with
success
it
was
wonderfully
uniform
and
written
in
david
s
neat
and
vigorous
hand
i
ll
get
on
with
another
page
of
them
if
you
like
suggested
bags
all
the
fellows
say
i
write
exactly
like
thanks
that
s
jolly
good
of
you
said
david
and
you
do
write
awfully
like
me
i
wonder
why
you
used
not
to
as
when
maddox
spotted
my
handwriting
in
that
oh
i
suppose
it
s
being
with
you
and
all
that
said
bags
vaguely
knowing
quite
well
that
he
had
long
tried
to
write
like
david
out
of
affection
and
admiration
for
all
that
pertained
to
his
pal
i
ll
begin
at
line
a
hundred
shall
i
so
that
when
you
get
there
you
can
skip
the
next
hundred
and
go
on
at
line
two
hundred
yes
that
s
the
trick
said
david
thanks
awfully
sure
it
doesn
t
bore
you
i
say
shall
i
lash
a
couple
more
pens
for
you
don
t
think
i
should
get
on
well
with
them
said
bags
the
lent
term
about
half
of
which
was
now
over
seemed
to
david
a
very
poor
affair
in
comparison
with
other
terms
rugby
football
was
finished
with
cricket
of
course
did
not
exist
the
weather
had
been
consistently
diluvian
so
that
the
where
he
had
intended
to
pass
most
of
his
leisure
were
generally
half
flooded
other
fellows
it
is
true
were
busy
on
athletics
but
david
seeing
through
frank
s
eyes
had
no
sympathy
with
just
running
when
there
was
no
ulterior
object
except
to
run
quicker
than
anybody
else
in
fact
there
were
no
games
except
fives
and
racquets
and
the
demand
for
courts
being
largely
in
excess
of
the
supply
he
could
not
get
one
as
often
as
his
energy
needed
thus
since
there
was
so
little
that
might
legitimately
be
done
he
had
chiefly
occupied
himself
in
breaking
and
as
bags
had
said
he
had
really
passed
most
of
the
half
in
writing
lines
which
though
it
took
time
merely
bottled
up
instead
of
relieving
him
of
his
exuberant
vitality
furthermore
since
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
his
getting
out
of
the
middle
fifth
at
easter
only
geniuses
of
whom
he
was
certainly
not
one
did
that
david
had
argued
that
the
less
time
he
spent
over
work
the
better
the
worst
of
it
was
there
was
so
very
little
to
do
and
maddox
had
jawed
david
on
this
subject
of
playing
the
goat
before
suggesting
that
the
devil
had
entered
into
him
it
was
not
quite
that
really
it
was
only
the
rampageous
energy
of
david
s
youth
seeking
an
outlet
he
was
growing
enormously
and
as
sometimes
happened
this
process
did
not
make
him
languid
and
slack
but
seemed
only
to
increase
the
vitality
that
stirred
and
bubbled
in
him
as
in
some
colt
making
him
throw
up
his
limbs
and
scamper
simply
because
he
was
vigorous
and
growing
but
his
escapades
and
general
obstreperousness
somewhat
exercised
his
friend
as
well
as
his
who
at
the
present
moment
while
david
and
bags
were
writing
lines
together
was
talking
to
the
prefect
about
the
house
in
general
and
the
affairs
of
david
in
particular
his
general
line
as
has
been
said
was
to
let
the
senior
boys
run
the
house
while
he
enjoyed
the
tranquillity
that
their
management
brought
him
but
david
s
persistent
adventures
had
protruded
themselves
into
his
notice
and
a
consultation
with
maddox
seemed
to
him
desirable
about
david
he
said
it
s
only
energy
frank
and
not
viciousness
you
gave
just
the
same
sort
of
trouble
yourself
when
you
were
his
sorry
sir
said
maddox
but
i
don
t
believe
i
was
ever
quite
such
a
nuisance
as
david
is
if
ever
there
s
a
crash
in
the
house
it
s
always
david
breaking
a
window
or
throwing
his
boots
at
can
t
you
do
anything
with
him
asked
adams
he
ll
listen
to
you
when
he
won
t
attend
to
a
word
i
oh
he
listens
to
me
all
right
said
maddox
but
then
he
forgets
besides
he
s
so
awfully
funny
he
makes
me
adams
lit
his
pipe
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
fire
for
maddox
happened
to
be
occupying
his
particular
at
the
moment
all
the
electric
lights
went
out
i
d
bet
a
shilling
said
maddox
that
david
s
at
the
bottom
of
that
shall
i
go
and
see
sir
yes
do
and
then
come
maddox
felt
his
way
along
the
passage
to
david
s
study
and
knocked
he
always
knocked
before
he
went
into
other
people
s
rooms
come
in
shouted
david
but
take
care
of
yourself
whoever
you
are
there
are
inkpots
about
and
it
s
as
dark
as
hell
and
smells
of
cheese
good
old
bags
fancy
finding
a
candle
in
this
den
hullo
frank
have
you
been
fooling
with
the
electric
light
asked
maddox
yes
of
course
this
beastly
plug
didn
t
work
and
so
i
dug
a
knife
into
its
bowels
and
something
went
off
and
gave
me
an
awful
ass
said
maddox
you
ve
put
out
the
lights
all
over
this
passage
and
adams
s
oh
what
larks
said
david
let
s
have
a
procession
of
the
unemployed
who
want
to
work
like
good
little
saps
and
can
t
work
in
the
dark
let
let
me
just
get
at
you
said
maddox
as
david
dodged
round
the
table
i
ll
teach
david
squealed
with
hideous
resonance
well
it
wasn
t
my
fault
he
said
i
only
jabbed
it
with
a
knife
wow
spare
me
have
mercy
upon
me
wow
frank
drove
david
to
a
corner
and
punched
him
heavily
in
the
ribs
and
boxed
his
ears
and
smacked
his
head
summary
and
effectual
justice
being
then
done
he
observed
david
s
patent
lashed
pens
i
know
that
trick
he
said
what
is
the
virtuous
bags
doing
lines
too
oh
yes
said
bags
airily
some
of
the
fourth
for
david
i
suppose
eh
well
yes
said
bags
how
many
lines
is
it
this
time
asked
maddox
and
what
for
five
hundred
said
david
at
present
for
a
good
little
owlers
gosh
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
hit
so
do
you
and
what
has
good
little
owlers
done
david
began
to
laugh
oh
lord
it
was
funny
he
said
it
was
worth
five
hundred
lines
he
s
just
as
blind
as
possible
blinder
than
tovey
you
know
and
i
thought
it
was
very
likely
i
shouldn
t
be
put
on
why
asked
maddox
oh
i
don
t
know
it
seemed
likely
well
he
was
taking
us
in
the
museum
so
i
fetched
down
a
stuffed
seal
and
stuck
it
up
in
my
place
so
that
if
he
counted
heads
i
should
be
there
and
then
i
went
to
play
squash
bags
you
go
on
i
didn
t
bags
took
up
the
wondrous
tale
there
we
all
were
said
bags
with
the
seal
sitting
up
in
david
s
place
i
saw
owlers
count
heads
and
then
we
began
construing
then
it
didn
t
quite
pan
out
as
david
expected
for
after
a
bit
owlers
said
go
on
blaize
and
of
course
the
seal
didn
t
say
anything
poor
thing
how
could
it
said
david
and
then
owlers
said
looking
very
kind
perhaps
you
haven
t
prepared
quite
as
far
but
the
seal
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
and
owlers
asked
him
why
he
didn
t
answer
and
then
owlers
gave
him
a
long
jaw
and
told
him
he
was
sulky
and
there
the
seal
sat
with
his
glass
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
finally
owlers
got
awful
sick
with
him
and
set
him
five
hundred
it
was
no
use
trying
not
to
laugh
the
idea
of
owlers
jawing
the
seal
was
too
much
for
maddox
and
the
three
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
and
didn
t
he
spot
the
seal
at
all
asked
maddox
at
length
rather
not
he
went
tottering
out
at
the
end
of
the
hour
just
reminding
the
seal
to
show
them
up
david
took
up
his
double
pen
again
oh
i
wish
somebody
else
had
done
it
he
said
for
i
missed
owlers
jawing
the
seal
but
it
was
my
maddox
got
up
well
you
ll
get
into
worse
trouble
if
you
don
t
look
out
he
said
i
m
talking
you
over
with
oh
may
i
come
and
listen
outside
the
door
you
may
well
stick
up
for
me
said
david
encouragingly
maddox
went
back
to
his
house
master
still
giggling
well
did
david
make
the
darkness
he
asked
yes
sir
rather
he
investigated
the
electric
plug
with
a
knife
and
something
went
off
he
said
so
i
hit
him
about
they
re
putting
another
fuse
he
laughed
again
david
was
writing
five
hundred
lines
as
usual
he
said
with
bags
helping
i
think
i
must
tell
you
adams
made
no
attempt
at
gravity
and
shook
with
laughter
but
it
can
t
go
on
he
said
david
s
becoming
a
nuisance
and
gating
him
and
giving
him
lines
to
write
is
no
earthly
good
what
he
wants
is
a
good
licking
and
plenty
of
exercise
there
s
not
an
ounce
of
harm
in
oh
he
s
the
straightest
chap
in
the
world
said
maddox
well
you
might
warn
him
tell
him
next
time
he
s
reported
to
me
i
shall
send
him
to
the
head
with
a
request
that
he
shall
be
swished
and
how
s
the
rest
of
the
house
oh
pretty
slack
sir
it
s
rotten
weather
you
see
weather
makes
a
lot
of
difference
to
i
know
there
s
always
more
trouble
this
half
than
any
try
to
keep
them
up
to
the
mark
i
ll
do
my
best
sir
but
i
ve
got
an
awful
lot
of
work
with
this
trinity
scholarship
exam
coming
or
in
a
fortnight
i
m
as
rusty
as
nails
over
my
adams
smoked
his
pipe
for
a
little
in
silence
by
the
way
you
pull
all
right
with
cruikshank
now
don
t
you
he
asked
rather
i
used
to
bar
him
awfully
but
we
had
a
talk
after
hughes
was
sent
away
and
decided
to
get
on
better
together
crookles
is
a
good
glad
you
ve
found
that
out
said
adams
you
never
would
believe
me
when
i
told
you
so
well
tell
david
that
the
wooden
eye
of
nemesis
is
on
him
and
see
if
you
can
t
make
him
less
obstreperous
he
thinks
more
of
what
you
say
than
of
what
any
one
else
says
he
simply
jumped
down
my
throat
the
other
day
in
your
what
about
sir
because
i
ventured
to
criticise
your
play
in
that
tie
when
we
were
nearly
beaten
by
thomas
s
i
said
i
thought
we
should
have
won
more
easily
if
you
had
served
with
more
care
and
less
force
david
turned
quite
purple
and
said
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
knew
what
he
was
frightful
cheek
said
maddox
well
i
don
t
know
he
only
reminded
me
that
you
know
more
about
racquets
than
i
do
which
is
perfectly
true
well
are
you
off
tell
david
not
to
make
himself
so
maddox
went
upstairs
again
after
this
to
his
study
where
his
fag
was
putting
out
his
david
of
course
after
his
promotion
into
the
fifth
form
had
ceased
to
be
in
a
state
of
servitude
and
his
successor
was
a
small
bony
youth
called
jevons
who
usually
had
a
cold
in
the
head
and
an
inky
handkerchief
with
which
to
minister
to
it
there
was
no
kind
of
briskness
about
him
he
was
timid
and
slovenly
and
melancholy
and
went
about
his
duties
as
if
laying
out
the
for
the
funeral
of
a
dear
departed
friend
maddox
did
his
best
with
him
tried
to
encourage
him
to
look
the
world
in
the
face
a
little
more
and
wash
a
little
more
and
not
drag
his
feet
as
he
walked
but
it
was
a
dismal
change
from
being
attended
to
by
the
adroit
and
willing
david
david
it
is
true
sometimes
smashed
things
by
running
with
them
or
from
excess
of
zeal
in
cleaning
the
inside
of
a
but
that
was
better
than
finding
forgotten
in
the
pot
one
day
or
crumbs
and
other
foreign
substances
in
the
sugar
and
little
bits
of
butter
sticking
to
the
bottom
of
the
plates
but
though
maddox
was
kind
to
this
spiritless
youth
david
on
the
occasions
when
he
came
across
him
was
severely
critical
it
seemed
to
him
a
dreadful
affair
that
his
place
should
be
filled
by
so
abject
a
specimen
and
mixed
with
his
contempt
for
jevons
there
was
a
certain
jealousy
that
he
should
go
in
and
out
of
maddox
s
study
as
he
chose
and
joylessly
perform
all
the
offices
in
which
david
had
delighted
boy
as
he
was
he
would
have
loved
to
continue
fagging
for
maddox
for
the
sake
of
seeing
that
he
was
properly
looked
after
and
for
the
intimacy
which
that
would
give
him
now
since
their
ages
and
places
sundered
them
so
widely
in
ordinary
david
necessarily
saw
much
less
of
him
than
before
he
knew
that
this
must
be
so
but
it
did
not
make
him
like
jevons
the
more
there
was
the
sound
of
cheerful
whistling
going
on
from
the
where
david
was
washing
up
on
his
own
account
when
maddox
came
up
to
his
study
but
it
ceased
as
jevons
went
in
to
fill
his
kettle
and
a
admonitory
voice
took
its
place
well
have
you
put
a
nice
bit
of
butter
in
the
it
voice
was
as
unmistakably
david
s
as
the
or
have
you
rubbed
it
round
the
edge
of
the
lord
rinse
out
the
kettle
before
you
fill
it
can
t
you
here
give
it
me
i
say
you
really
should
smarten
yourself
up
a
bit
jevons
wash
your
hands
while
i
get
the
kettle
ready
i
wonder
maddox
can
eat
a
thing
when
you
ve
touched
his
david
shouted
maddox
want
me
asked
david
yes
come
here
a
minute
i
ve
got
something
to
say
to
david
went
to
his
study
followed
by
the
depressed
jevons
who
shuffled
about
the
room
for
a
bit
dropped
a
knife
and
then
left
them
jove
it
s
jolly
in
here
said
david
appreciatively
though
how
you
can
stand
that
scug
mucking
about
i
can
t
think
i
used
to
run
you
much
better
than
this
frank
what
do
you
want
me
about
i
ve
been
talking
to
adams
about
you
said
frank
and
i
should
advise
you
to
try
to
go
steadier
adams
told
me
to
tell
you
that
the
wooden
eye
of
nemesis
is
on
you
and
the
next
time
you
re
reported
he
s
going
to
send
you
to
the
head
to
be
david
shrugged
his
shoulders
wooden
eye
is
good
he
said
but
i
don
t
much
care
i
m
not
sure
i
wouldn
t
sooner
be
swished
than
be
writing
lines
to
all
eternity
i
never
get
them
done
there
are
always
some
finished
that
five
hundred
said
maddox
parenthically
lord
no
but
i
was
just
washing
up
and
taking
an
easy
bags
is
going
well
i
said
i
would
pass
on
adams
s
message
of
course
you
can
be
swished
if
you
like
nothing
easier
but
the
head
makes
you
feel
a
bit
cheap
first
and
afterwards
lays
david
sighed
heavily
i
suppose
i
ought
to
promise
you
to
be
an
absolute
record
for
saintliness
he
said
but
it
s
no
use
something
goes
fizz
inside
me
and
i
can
t
help
playing
the
fool
i
wish
i
was
older
or
younger
if
i
was
older
i
suppose
i
should
see
what
a
rotter
i
am
and
if
i
was
younger
i
should
simply
do
what
you
told
me
i
know
you
re
right
but
then
comes
a
minute
and
i
can
t
help
doing
something
foolish
on
any
account
if
you
know
what
i
david
looked
round
the
study
again
and
it
made
him
feel
rather
melancholy
he
hadn
t
seen
much
of
frank
this
term
for
frank
had
been
working
hard
and
again
the
sense
of
the
distance
they
were
apart
in
the
world
of
school
severed
them
it
was
greater
now
that
he
was
an
independent
person
in
the
fifth
than
it
had
been
when
he
was
frank
s
fag
and
in
remove
a
and
the
intimacy
which
had
been
theirs
at
naseby
was
no
longer
possible
at
school
at
that
moment
also
a
tooth
began
suddenly
to
ache
and
gave
him
a
series
of
staccato
stabs
with
a
really
brilliant
touch
gosh
and
i
ve
got
the
toothache
he
said
it
s
suddenly
begun
hurting
like
sorry
said
frank
david
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
long
arms
and
legs
sprawling
it
ached
yesterday
he
said
but
then
i
didn
t
mind
as
i
was
having
a
good
time
over
the
seal
but
it
s
rot
having
toothache
when
other
things
are
beastly
why
should
this
blighter
decay
my
other
teeth
don
t
what
a
rotten
show
it
all
is
what
s
up
david
asked
frank
oh
i
don
t
know
there
s
a
sort
of
conspiracy
against
me
whatever
i
do
gets
found
out
and
i
m
writing
lines
and
being
gated
the
whole
blooming
time
and
the
sight
of
your
study
gives
me
the
hump
i
haven
t
been
here
for
a
week
i
should
think
and
now
you
re
sick
with
me
and
so
s
well
don
t
play
the
goat
said
frank
yes
it
s
easy
to
say
that
observed
david
but
it
isn
t
as
if
i
set
out
to
play
the
goat
it
just
comes
it
just
happens
oh
lord
the
seal
was
so
funny
sitting
there
on
its
sloping
brim
and
staring
with
its
glass
eyes
at
the
ceiling
and
all
my
books
spread
out
in
front
of
it
soon
as
i
d
got
it
fixed
i
hopped
out
of
the
window
you
know
there
it
was
looking
at
the
ceiling
all
and
the
owlers
never
guessed
it
wasn
t
a
david
gave
a
shrill
laugh
that
began
in
a
high
treble
and
ended
baritone
for
his
voice
was
cracking
then
he
became
quite
grave
again
things
are
rotten
he
said
i
get
amused
like
a
kid
and
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
it
i
remember
i
m
not
quite
such
a
kid
i
know
it
really
but
i
can
t
help
skipping
about
and
butting
round
why
can
t
i
be
your
fag
instead
of
that
mucky
jevons
and
if
not
why
can
t
i
be
a
sensible
person
i
made
jevons
wash
while
i
made
your
kettle
decent
again
you
should
have
seen
his
fingers
and
then
he
sniffs
and
blows
his
beastly
nose
with
a
sort
of
tight
sound
and
i
m
no
better
i
ve
got
the
toothache
and
i
m
gated
at
five
and
i
ve
the
best
part
of
five
hundred
lines
to
write
still
and
you
re
sick
with
me
and
i
shall
get
swished
if
i
don
t
take
frank
had
been
through
this
he
knew
the
transitional
disquiet
of
being
fifteen
which
has
just
got
to
be
lived
through
he
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
and
handed
it
to
david
i
think
i
won
t
he
said
i
ve
just
had
tea
isn
t
it
rum
how
you
can
be
no
end
cheerful
as
i
was
when
i
jabbed
the
electric
light
and
then
suddenly
go
rotten
i
dare
say
it
s
only
frank
got
up
there
s
some
chloroform
somewhere
he
said
which
i
used
for
killing
butterflies
if
you
stick
some
on
cotton
wool
and
jam
it
in
your
tooth
it
ll
be
all
he
rummaged
in
his
cupboard
and
with
the
aid
of
a
pin
put
the
soaked
wool
into
david
s
tooth
gosh
that
s
better
already
said
david
after
a
minute
thanks
awfully
perhaps
if
i
drank
some
tea
the
other
side
it
wouldn
t
hurt
there
was
a
cake
also
and
david
was
induced
to
try
this
as
well
better
he
said
at
last
that
s
good
more
well
just
a
little
then
i
ll
wash
up
for
you
properly
just
for
that
ll
be
ripping
of
you
and
as
we
re
pretending
you
re
my
fag
again
i
shall
just
jaw
you
you
see
i
know
quite
well
what
it
feels
like
to
do
something
goatish
just
because
it
s
against
the
rules
but
that
wears
off
david
you
ll
get
to
know
that
most
rules
are
pretty
sensible
you
see
you
couldn
t
have
a
whole
division
of
stuffed
seals
therefore
you
mustn
t
have
david
laughed
in
a
manner
oh
but
wouldn
t
they
look
ripping
he
said
yes
but
things
couldn
t
go
on
if
every
one
behaved
like
you
therefore
you
mustn
t
see
by
the
way
i
told
adams
you
were
the
straightest
chap
in
the
david
flushed
with
pleasure
oh
did
you
really
he
said
yes
why
not
but
he
ll
send
you
to
be
swished
just
the
same
if
you
bore
david
got
out
of
his
chair
well
i
ll
try
not
to
he
said
so
i
d
better
get
on
with
those
perhaps
you
had
i
must
work
too
and
don
t
get
any
more
you
ve
only
got
to
stump
along
and
be
ordinary
by
the
by
i
ve
got
a
racquet
court
at
twelve
and
i
can
t
use
it
you
may
have
it
if
you
oh
ripping
said
david
tooth
out
first
then
racquets
thanks
he
lingered
a
moment
what
jolly
good
days
those
were
at
naseby
he
said
i
know
that
they
re
all
alive
too
there
ll
be
lots
more
of
david
put
his
hands
on
frank
s
shoulders
as
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
by
the
fireplace
i
believe
they
are
he
said
and
i
believe
i
m
as
tall
as
oh
you
re
getting
a
big
lout
said
maddox
but
the
evil
star
continued
to
shine
balefully
on
david
next
day
the
device
of
the
double
pen
was
promptly
detected
by
howliss
his
lines
were
torn
over
all
to
be
done
again
and
bags
s
friendly
help
was
vain
labour
also
bags
had
been
opposed
to
the
system
on
the
ground
that
it
was
liable
to
detection
and
though
theoretically
it
saved
time
it
didn
t
save
so
much
as
nobody
could
wield
the
double
pen
with
the
same
swiftness
as
the
single
one
consequently
he
made
no
renewed
offer
of
help
with
regard
to
the
reimposed
imposition
and
david
had
to
stop
in
at
twelve
next
day
after
an
excruciating
interview
with
the
dentist
instead
of
playing
racquets
and
this
parsimonious
dentist
quite
refused
to
whip
out
the
aching
tooth
and
have
done
with
it
a
pang
to
which
david
had
strung
himself
up
he
said
it
could
be
saved
and
the
salvation
thereof
included
a
whizzing
drill
and
the
stuffing
of
it
with
something
painful
to
the
feelings
and
obnoxious
to
the
taste
and
implied
a
further
visit
the
day
after
then
followed
a
brief
interval
of
delightful
happenings
while
the
baleful
star
hid
itself
the
tooth
was
comforted
and
reinforced
so
that
it
could
be
bitten
on
again
even
with
nuts
an
unexpected
largesse
of
ten
shillings
from
his
father
and
half
a
crown
from
margery
which
was
almost
insanely
noble
of
her
turned
up
and
with
bags
for
a
partner
david
won
the
school
competition
this
was
a
triumph
of
the
juiciest
kind
for
all
europe
must
have
known
that
bags
was
a
of
no
class
at
all
and
that
portion
of
civilised
europe
which
saw
the
final
were
aware
that
david
practically
played
it
single
butting
about
from
side
to
side
of
the
court
while
bags
effaced
himself
in
the
manner
of
a
shadow
against
the
wall
so
as
not
to
be
in
the
way
that
meant
another
sovereign
which
had
to
be
expended
in
the
purchase
of
a
small
silver
commemorative
cup
and
to
that
sum
he
added
five
shillings
out
of
the
tips
from
home
and
bought
for
it
a
black
polished
stand
of
with
a
plated
shield
on
which
was
engraved
his
name
and
that
of
his
innocuous
partner
first
of
my
cups
he
announced
when
it
came
home
and
it
jolly
well
will
not
be
the
last
won
t
it
be
ripping
when
i
have
a
whole
of
them
no
i
m
blowed
if
i
have
my
tea
in
an
ordinary
cup
pour
it
in
here
bags
and
i
ll
drink
your
good
health
for
getting
out
of
the
way
so
well
lord
how
hot
it
gets
simultaneously
with
these
propitious
events
came
the
early
rounds
of
the
house
handicap
golf
competition
david
had
adopted
a
wise
policy
over
this
for
ten
days
before
the
links
had
been
practically
unplayable
owing
to
floods
but
he
had
remembered
a
word
of
frank
s
if
you
want
to
improve
go
out
with
half
a
dozen
balls
and
practise
mashie
shots
on
to
a
green
when
you
ve
got
them
all
there
putt
them
all
so
for
the
last
week
david
had
slacked
out
with
a
mashie
and
a
putter
found
a
green
that
was
not
under
water
and
had
put
this
hint
into
practice
it
was
dull
but
then
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
the
reward
looked
within
reach
he
had
been
entered
with
a
handicap
of
fifteen
but
thanks
to
his
practice
he
was
already
a
stroke
or
two
better
than
that
he
had
met
maddox
in
the
second
round
and
receiving
eleven
strokes
had
beaten
him
then
he
encountered
gregson
whom
he
played
on
level
terms
and
emerging
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
from
that
had
wiped
up
the
floor
with
cruikshank
who
gave
him
six
this
brought
him
to
the
then
from
behind
the
clouds
out
popped
the
baleful
star
again
and
shed
its
dreadful
beams
on
him
with
peculiar
effulgence
first
of
all
maddox
went
up
to
cambridge
for
his
scholarship
examination
and
david
who
had
never
known
what
school
was
like
without
the
sense
of
his
being
there
who
was
the
first
person
he
saw
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
and
the
last
before
he
went
to
sleep
at
night
felt
lost
and
rudderless
next
him
in
dormitory
was
the
empty
bed
and
all
day
long
he
knew
there
was
no
chance
of
frank
s
dropping
in
or
calling
him
to
his
study
then
bags
got
influenza
and
disappeared
also
leaving
david
bereft
of
his
two
great
friends
to
find
out
for
the
first
time
how
solid
and
comfortable
a
pal
bags
was
then
came
the
of
the
in
which
he
was
completely
off
his
game
and
got
beaten
on
level
terms
by
the
mild
and
spotty
joynes
to
whom
david
felt
competent
to
give
four
strokes
in
the
round
but
such
proved
on
this
fatal
afternoon
not
to
be
the
case
it
was
a
gusty
boisterous
day
and
david
liable
at
all
times
to
be
rather
wild
and
given
to
exuberant
slicing
sliced
in
a
manner
probably
without
parallel
with
his
loose
arms
he
could
drive
a
very
long
ball
but
that
was
a
disadvantage
rather
than
otherwise
since
he
sent
it
to
remote
this
was
exasperating
and
joynes
who
usually
had
the
honour
exasperated
him
further
for
having
himself
gone
not
far
but
straight
up
the
middle
of
the
course
he
overwhelmed
david
with
a
sort
of
envious
condolence
by
jove
what
a
long
ball
he
would
say
as
david
s
drive
started
on
its
insane
career
i
wish
i
could
drive
like
that
oh
the
wind
s
catching
it
bad
luck
look
where
it
s
going
miles
away
it
ll
be
rotten
bad
luck
if
it
s
on
the
or
again
david
would
make
an
astonishingly
feeble
putt
and
joynes
again
showed
sympathy
pity
it
wasn
t
a
little
harder
it
was
dead
on
the
line
i
wish
i
could
putt
as
straight
as
that
hullo
you
ve
missed
the
second
one
too
that
leaves
me
three
for
it
you
d
much
better
make
me
putt
them
out
i
can
miss
anything
hullo
it
s
gone
in
this
sort
of
thing
goaded
david
to
madness
and
presently
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
say
would
you
mind
not
talking
quite
so
much
he
said
politely
it
s
awfully
rotten
of
me
but
i
think
it
puts
me
upon
which
joynes
hermetically
sealed
his
lips
till
they
came
to
the
fourteenth
hole
where
the
match
came
to
an
abject
end
all
this
was
sufficiently
depressing
and
there
was
no
quietly
sympathetic
bags
to
be
a
comfort
nor
was
there
bags
to
get
tea
ready
and
it
struck
david
really
for
the
first
time
how
invariably
bags
did
that
and
he
could
not
find
his
and
when
he
did
it
smelled
sour
for
it
had
not
been
washed
up
and
there
was
nothing
to
eat
and
he
would
have
to
go
up
to
to
get
a
cake
it
was
all
deplorable
and
on
the
way
he
met
gregson
his
victim
in
the
third
round
suppose
you
disposed
of
joynes
all
right
blazes
he
asked
no
he
disposed
of
me
easily
as
anything
said
david
hurrah
mean
sorry
but
you
see
i
bet
a
shilling
he
congratters
said
david
insincerely
the
wind
had
turned
bitterly
cold
and
spikes
of
sleet
half
frozen
had
begun
to
fall
as
he
came
back
from
the
shop
that
again
seemed
to
david
part
of
the
conspiracy
to
make
his
life
as
disagreeable
and
uncomfortable
as
possible
nature
herself
had
joined
in
he
did
not
want
to
be
unreasonable
but
if
on
the
top
of
all
these
things
it
was
going
to
snow
he
felt
that
even
job
s
patience
would
break
down
snow
ruined
everything
it
was
incompatible
with
any
form
of
exercise
and
mournfully
he
went
back
to
his
solitary
study
but
when
he
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pulled
his
chair
up
to
the
pipes
so
that
he
could
rest
his
feet
on
them
and
divided
his
attention
between
ravenshoe
held
in
one
hand
he
had
got
to
where
gus
and
flora
were
naughty
in
church
and
tea
in
the
other
things
seemed
to
cheer
up
a
little
outside
evidently
the
weather
had
got
worse
for
the
wind
squealed
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
on
his
panes
behind
the
thick
red
curtains
he
could
hear
the
muffled
patter
of
the
driven
snow
and
after
all
there
was
a
bright
side
to
snow
for
it
would
mean
that
there
would
be
prayers
in
the
house
and
he
would
not
have
to
turn
out
to
go
to
chapel
and
maddox
would
be
back
on
saturday
and
it
was
thursday
evening
already
also
bags
had
written
to
him
from
the
saying
that
he
was
better
and
expected
to
be
out
again
by
sunday
david
s
spirits
began
to
improve
and
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
in
order
to
enjoy
a
greater
intimacy
with
the
pipes
and
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
as
flora
announced
that
she
had
left
her
purse
on
the
piano
it
would
have
been
a
poor
heart
that
did
not
rejoice
next
morning
for
during
the
night
the
wind
dropped
and
so
smart
a
frost
had
set
in
that
the
snow
lay
hard
and
crusted
on
the
ground
and
it
would
be
clearly
possible
to
go
tobogganing
on
the
slopes
of
the
down
at
twelve
at
breakfast
moreover
there
was
a
postcard
for
him
from
frank
with
a
highly
coloured
photograph
of
the
great
quadrangle
at
trinity
on
the
back
and
a
couple
of
lines
to
say
he
would
be
back
by
on
saturday
and
that
cambridge
was
a
topping
place
it
warmed
david
s
heart
to
think
that
frank
should
have
remembered
him
and
with
the
prospect
of
tobogganing
at
twelve
and
the
cheer
of
the
sun
his
spirits
went
up
to
a
pitch
of
inexpressible
buoyancy
as
he
slid
along
the
trodden
path
to
go
to
clock
school
paths
had
been
swept
in
schoolyard
between
the
various
but
the
rest
of
the
broad
space
lay
white
and
untrodden
david
got
there
while
it
still
wanted
five
minutes
to
ten
and
hung
about
with
a
few
friends
outside
the
door
till
the
hour
should
strike
there
was
a
quiet
exchange
of
small
snowballing
furtively
delivered
for
it
was
very
strictly
forbidden
in
the
quadrangle
and
david
had
just
lobbed
one
not
bigger
than
a
with
extraordinary
success
just
between
the
collar
and
neck
of
joynes
who
had
not
the
vaguest
idea
who
had
done
this
now
he
was
moulding
another
larger
one
in
his
hand
with
an
absent
eye
in
joynes
s
direction
and
his
shoulders
trembling
with
suppressed
laughter
for
joynes
s
attempts
to
scoop
the
snow
out
were
really
very
funny
when
gregson
came
up
to
him
jolly
good
shot
he
said
i
saw
but
i
bet
you
can
t
chuck
a
snowball
right
across
the
said
david
all
in
one
word
he
put
down
his
books
took
a
couple
of
quick
steps
and
discharged
the
snowball
he
had
prepared
he
had
aimed
it
a
high
howitzer
sort
of
shot
at
the
blank
wall
opposite
but
it
went
rather
to
the
left
and
at
the
exact
second
of
his
throwing
it
the
door
of
the
master
s
opened
and
out
came
owlers
lord
i
ve
got
him
squealed
david
though
he
had
not
intended
to
get
anybody
and
immediately
behind
owlers
came
the
head
david
was
quite
right
the
snowball
got
owlers
just
in
the
middle
of
the
waistcoat
and
the
head
saw
very
quickly
and
delicately
the
group
of
boys
among
whom
david
was
standing
dispersed
into
the
two
that
stood
side
by
side
david
with
them
and
amid
stifled
sniggers
took
their
places
immediately
afterwards
the
head
entered
stiffly
rustling
did
any
boy
here
throw
a
snowball
across
the
court
just
now
he
asked
david
stood
up
at
once
it
was
no
good
not
doing
that
for
unless
he
gave
himself
up
it
was
quite
certain
that
there
would
be
punishment
for
the
whole
of
the
two
forms
in
their
corner
of
the
court
and
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
you
blaize
said
the
head
yes
very
well
you
knew
that
snowballing
in
court
was
forbidden
yes
sir
said
david
who
is
your
mr
adams
that
was
all
for
the
present
but
after
school
david
saw
the
head
talking
to
adams
and
remembering
adams
s
warning
felt
prepared
for
the
worst
and
tobogganed
without
any
particular
zest
subsequently
that
day
adams
remarked
laconically
so
you
re
determined
to
have
your
way
david
and
next
morning
the
school
porter
entered
his
with
a
small
blue
paper
which
he
presented
to
owlers
he
peered
at
it
in
his
manner
blaize
to
go
to
the
head
at
twelve
he
said
going
to
the
head
at
twelve
implied
knocking
at
the
door
of
a
small
empty
barely
furnished
next
the
room
the
head
was
there
waiting
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
and
looking
vexed
blaize
i
have
been
talking
to
your
about
you
he
said
and
he
tells
me
that
you
have
given
a
great
deal
of
trouble
this
term
he
tells
me
also
that
he
had
warned
you
that
the
next
time
you
made
a
nuisance
of
yourself
he
would
send
you
to
me
did
you
get
that
warning
yes
sir
said
david
very
well
then
i
shall
give
you
a
good
whipping
he
said
it
isn
t
for
just
throwing
a
snowball
you
understand
but
for
all
the
accumulation
of
silly
disobedient
things
you
have
done
you
have
been
gated
several
times
this
term
and
you
have
had
frequent
impositions
your
gives
me
exactly
a
similar
report
of
you
these
punishments
don
t
seem
to
have
made
any
impression
on
you
so
i
shall
try
another
plan
it
s
no
use
your
going
on
like
this
and
i
m
not
going
to
have
it
rules
are
made
for
you
to
obey
whereas
you
seem
to
think
you
may
break
them
or
not
exactly
as
you
please
they
were
not
made
without
a
purpose
and
i
am
going
to
show
you
that
they
can
not
be
broken
indefinitely
without
great
david
had
not
quite
allowed
for
the
horrid
effect
of
the
head
s
tongue
he
had
faced
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
be
swished
but
he
had
not
faced
the
fact
that
the
head
would
take
all
the
stuffing
out
of
him
first
so
to
speak
just
when
he
wanted
the
stuffing
i
am
not
going
to
whip
you
for
my
amusement
he
continued
walking
towards
a
cupboard
far
less
for
yours
i
am
whipping
you
because
i
wish
to
give
you
something
by
which
to
remember
that
you
must
keep
rules
instead
of
breaking
them
reasonable
methods
have
been
tried
with
you
and
they
don
t
succeed
and
i
am
going
to
treat
you
as
if
you
weren
t
reasonable
and
hurt
you
i
don
t
like
doing
it
you
will
like
it
much
less
and
i
want
you
to
understand
that
it
s
a
lower
method
of
treating
a
boy
like
you
who
is
quite
big
enough
and
clever
enough
to
know
better
you
have
been
behaving
like
an
unreasonable
animal
instead
of
a
sensible
boy
you
are
going
to
be
sharply
reminded
to
have
more
sense
in
the
future
now
get
david
had
not
imagined
it
would
be
pleasant
but
it
was
a
great
deal
more
unpleasant
than
he
had
anticipated
the
head
never
swished
unless
he
meant
it
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
light
swishing
and
that
fact
was
most
clearly
comprehended
by
david
during
the
next
minute
nor
was
there
any
consolation
from
his
executioner
when
it
was
over
that
will
do
he
said
you
richly
deserve
what
i
have
given
you
don
t
let
me
have
to
send
for
you
david
went
out
biting
his
lip
it
had
really
been
very
hard
not
to
cry
out
under
those
stinging
blows
considering
how
very
abject
he
felt
before
they
had
begun
and
almost
the
worst
part
of
all
was
the
waiting
between
the
strokes
which
were
delivered
with
pauses
for
thought
but
he
got
through
without
giving
himself
away
and
went
down
to
his
house
feeling
rather
glad
that
bags
was
in
the
since
an
interval
to
pull
himself
together
again
in
solitude
was
certainly
desirable
but
hardly
had
he
got
into
his
study
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
maddox
entered
hullo
david
he
said
i
ve
just
got
back
did
you
get
my
postcard
i
half
wondered
whether
you
would
come
up
to
the
station
i
say
what
s
up
just
been
swished
said
david
what
for
accumulations
so
that
blasted
head
told
me
throwing
a
snowball
finished
oh
you
infernal
ass
said
maddox
you
jolly
well
deserved
at
that
the
devil
no
less
entered
into
david
anyhow
i
never
deserved
being
expelled
he
said
very
evilly
frank
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
without
a
word
he
left
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
david
was
not
in
the
least
sorry
for
that
speech
he
was
smarting
himself
and
if
all
frank
had
to
say
was
that
he
deserved
it
he
was
glad
to
have
made
frank
smart
too
and
then
with
a
sudden
sense
of
sick
regret
he
remembered
who
frank
was
and
all
that
frank
had
been
to
him
and
on
the
moment
he
was
out
of
his
study
and
off
down
the
passage
to
frank
s
he
went
in
without
knocking
i
say
i
m
a
damnable
chap
he
said
i
m
frightfully
sorry
i
don
t
know
if
you
can
forgive
he
put
out
a
rather
timid
hand
instantly
it
was
clasped
and
held
i
didn
t
mean
it
he
said
i
felt
david
old
chap
said
frank
they
stood
there
for
a
minute
in
silence
for
really
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
then
david
smiled
i
think
i
d
better
not
make
an
ass
of
myself
any
more
he
said
beastly
good
idea
said
frank
chapter
xii
david
was
sitting
on
the
steps
in
front
of
the
in
with
a
pad
on
each
leg
and
a
glove
on
each
hand
and
an
icy
lump
of
nervous
fear
inside
his
canvas
shirt
to
take
the
place
of
a
heart
but
nobody
paid
the
least
attention
to
him
or
gave
him
a
single
word
of
encouragement
or
cared
at
all
for
his
condition
because
everybody
was
utterly
absorbed
in
what
was
going
on
at
the
wickets
the
whole
school
and
the
whole
staff
were
there
watching
the
end
of
the
final
tie
in
in
absolute
tense
silence
except
when
a
run
was
scored
or
a
smart
piece
of
fielding
prevented
one
being
scored
then
a
roar
went
up
from
all
round
the
ground
cut
off
again
suddenly
as
if
a
hand
had
been
placed
over
all
the
mouths
of
some
beast
as
the
bowler
received
the
ball
again
during
the
pause
between
overs
a
buzz
of
talk
rose
as
if
the
cork
had
been
taken
out
of
a
bottle
where
sonorous
bees
were
confined
this
talk
was
silenced
as
the
next
over
began
probably
such
a
final
as
this
had
been
seen
before
but
that
did
not
detract
from
the
tenseness
of
the
excitement
the
present
position
arrived
at
through
many
delightful
adventures
was
that
adams
s
wanted
twenty
more
runs
to
win
with
two
wickets
to
fall
maddox
luckily
was
in
still
and
cruikshank
a
miserable
performer
with
the
bat
was
in
with
him
if
either
of
them
got
out
the
forlorn
and
trembling
david
had
to
take
his
place
last
wicket
to
totter
down
the
steps
and
walk
apparently
about
twenty
miles
to
the
wicket
in
the
full
light
of
day
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
on
him
maddox
of
course
was
the
only
hope
of
salvation
neither
david
nor
cruikshank
could
even
by
their
most
optimistic
friends
be
considered
as
capable
of
doing
anything
but
getting
out
against
such
strength
of
bowling
as
they
had
against
them
and
in
order
to
make
david
quite
happy
and
comfortable
about
it
all
there
was
indelibly
written
on
the
tablets
of
his
memory
the
fact
that
he
had
got
out
second
ball
in
the
first
innings
without
as
the
school
paper
would
record
on
saturday
having
troubled
the
scorer
what
if
the
paper
added
that
in
the
second
innings
he
proved
himself
as
independent
of
the
scorer
again
so
while
the
groups
of
boys
round
him
regaling
themselves
the
while
on
bags
of
cherries
and
baskets
of
strawberries
seethed
with
pleasant
irresponsible
excitement
david
was
merely
perfectly
miserable
as
he
waited
for
the
roar
that
would
go
up
round
the
field
to
show
another
wicket
had
fallen
that
would
not
be
abruptly
cut
off
like
the
tumult
that
succeeded
a
run
or
a
piece
of
fielding
the
toveyites
would
go
on
screaming
well
bowled
or
well
caught
until
he
marched
out
across
the
field
all
that
he
could
think
of
in
this
hour
of
waiting
was
the
fact
that
he
had
been
completely
bowled
by
the
second
ball
he
received
in
the
first
innings
after
having
been
completely
beaten
by
the
first
tomlin
who
had
kindly
sent
down
that
fatal
delivery
was
bowling
now
and
no
doubt
he
would
be
bowling
still
when
he
went
in
the
match
had
been
full
of
entrancing
and
agonising
vicissitudes
adams
s
had
batted
first
piling
up
a
respectable
total
of
a
hundred
and
which
gave
no
cause
for
complaint
then
tovey
s
had
gone
in
and
had
been
ignominiously
dismissed
by
cruikshank
and
mellor
for
and
the
sages
were
inclined
to
think
that
the
match
was
as
good
as
over
they
had
followed
on
but
instead
of
being
dismissed
for
again
they
had
amassed
the
huge
total
of
three
hundred
and
cruikshank
the
demon
of
the
first
innings
had
been
hit
completely
off
his
length
and
david
had
been
put
on
as
first
change
not
having
bowled
at
all
in
the
first
innings
but
the
glorious
personal
result
of
that
afternoon
s
work
gave
him
no
encouragement
now
for
his
mind
was
filled
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
with
the
fact
that
in
his
previous
appearance
with
the
bat
and
not
the
ball
tomlin
had
beaten
him
twice
and
bowled
him
once
but
yesterday
when
he
was
bowling
tovey
s
could
do
nothing
with
him
he
bowled
their
captain
anstruther
in
his
first
over
after
being
hit
twice
to
the
boundary
by
him
and
had
proved
himself
altogether
too
much
for
the
rest
of
the
side
the
wicket
was
fast
and
true
and
there
was
no
reason
for
their
not
being
able
to
play
him
except
the
excellent
one
that
he
bowled
extremely
well
he
was
with
very
high
action
and
had
as
an
accessory
cultivated
a
terrifying
prance
up
to
the
wickets
with
a
crooked
run
and
a
change
of
feet
in
the
middle
of
it
like
a
stumbling
horse
after
this
he
delivered
a
slow
high
ball
while
every
now
and
then
but
not
too
often
he
laced
one
in
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
with
precisely
the
same
delivery
in
the
end
he
had
taken
seven
wickets
for
ninety
runs
while
the
rest
of
the
three
hundred
and
had
been
scored
off
the
other
bowlers
of
the
side
who
had
captured
two
wickets
one
being
run
out
between
them
there
came
a
roar
from
the
ring
of
spectators
round
the
field
and
shouts
of
derisive
laughter
from
a
group
of
adams
s
boys
standing
near
and
david
forgetting
everything
else
for
the
moment
added
a
piercing
whistle
to
the
general
hubbub
tomlin
had
changed
his
field
with
the
obvious
intention
of
getting
maddox
caught
in
the
slips
sending
there
making
the
fourth
of
them
then
he
proceeded
to
bowl
a
little
wide
of
the
maddox
had
let
three
balls
go
by
but
the
fourth
he
pulled
round
to
exactly
where
had
been
and
scored
four
for
it
oh
a
great
stroke
and
no
one
could
tell
perhaps
not
even
maddox
how
it
was
done
there
was
one
more
ball
of
this
over
and
it
was
wonderfully
important
that
maddox
should
score
one
or
three
or
five
off
it
so
as
to
get
the
bowling
again
but
it
was
no
use
attempting
to
do
anything
with
such
a
ball
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
play
it
so
cruikshank
got
the
bowling
well
it
was
better
that
cruikshank
should
face
crawley
than
tomlin
if
only
tomlin
could
receive
a
telegram
saying
that
his
father
and
mother
and
his
three
brothers
and
his
four
sisters
if
he
had
any
were
all
seriously
ill
and
that
he
had
to
go
home
absolutely
this
minute
it
was
clear
that
cruikshank
was
knew
of
somebody
else
who
was
nervous
he
presented
a
dull
solid
wall
to
two
straight
balls
then
with
extreme
caution
he
lobbed
one
up
in
the
direction
of
and
ran
like
the
devil
come
on
he
shouted
to
maddox
for
he
was
just
as
anxious
that
maddox
should
get
the
bowling
as
was
the
rest
of
adams
s
maddox
wanted
a
run
as
much
as
anybody
but
he
was
completely
taken
by
surprise
at
the
impudence
of
this
but
there
was
cruikshank
half
way
up
the
pitch
and
it
meant
a
wicket
lost
if
he
told
him
to
go
back
so
he
too
ran
like
the
devil
the
situation
only
lasted
a
couple
of
seconds
but
it
made
up
in
quality
what
it
lacked
in
quantity
if
who
already
had
the
ball
in
his
hands
had
thrown
it
in
to
the
end
from
which
cruikshank
had
started
he
had
a
good
chance
of
getting
maddox
run
out
while
if
he
threw
it
in
to
the
bowler
close
to
him
he
had
the
practical
certainty
of
running
cruikshank
out
which
was
not
nearly
so
important
simultaneously
both
and
bowler
shouted
this
end
and
he
threw
it
wildly
to
about
the
middle
of
the
pitch
and
there
were
fifteen
more
runs
to
get
to
win
it
seemed
to
david
as
he
watched
forgetting
himself
for
a
moment
or
two
that
maddox
himself
was
feeling
the
strain
especially
after
this
last
and
unmerited
escape
he
spooned
a
ball
feebly
in
the
air
short
but
only
just
short
of
point
and
the
next
though
he
scored
two
off
it
was
the
most
dangerous
stroke
and
as
unlike
as
possible
to
his
usual
crisp
cutting
still
it
might
be
only
that
there
was
something
dreadfully
unexpected
about
that
ball
which
caused
him
to
it
but
if
only
he
would
kindly
balls
for
a
little
while
longer
then
came
the
last
ball
of
the
over
which
he
hit
out
at
completely
missed
it
and
was
nearly
bowled
so
cruikshank
had
to
face
the
fatal
tomlin
there
ensued
some
piercing
moments
there
was
an
appeal
for
a
catch
at
the
wickets
confidently
made
which
was
not
upheld
and
cruikshank
proceeded
to
play
like
a
clockwork
doll
imperfectly
wound
up
after
failing
to
play
two
balls
altogether
he
hit
out
as
hard
as
he
could
at
the
third
intending
to
drive
it
and
snicked
it
between
his
legs
for
one
but
that
gave
maddox
the
bowling
again
and
off
the
last
ball
he
scored
one
and
thus
secured
the
bowling
again
a
little
faint
glimmer
of
hope
came
into
david
s
heart
there
was
a
bye
for
two
which
left
eleven
runs
only
to
get
and
perhaps
perhaps
he
would
not
have
to
bat
at
all
if
only
maddox
would
hit
three
fours
in
succession
a
feat
of
which
he
was
perfectly
capable
the
match
would
be
over
and
david
thought
it
would
be
quite
impossible
ever
to
stop
shouting
again
for
nothing
in
the
whole
world
mattered
to
him
now
except
that
they
should
win
and
nobody
mattered
except
those
two
white
figures
at
the
wicket
yet
one
was
frank
and
david
so
far
mastered
his
trembling
knees
as
to
go
to
the
to
see
how
many
he
had
made
his
score
was
just
eighty
so
that
he
could
not
get
his
century
even
if
he
scored
the
rest
himself
rather
a
pity
but
certainly
nobody
would
care
less
than
frank
at
the
third
ball
he
opened
his
shoulders
and
gave
a
little
skip
out
to
drive
and
a
celestial
stroke
it
was
the
ball
flew
along
the
ground
rather
to
the
right
of
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
go
for
four
but
that
odious
fellow
just
reached
it
stopping
it
with
his
foot
made
a
beautiful
return
and
instead
of
four
it
was
a
single
only
and
cruikshank
had
the
bowling
a
roar
had
gone
up
on
account
of
the
smart
fielding
of
the
last
ball
and
was
instantly
silent
again
now
there
went
up
another
not
so
soon
coming
to
an
end
for
cruikshank
s
had
been
sent
flying
and
there
were
ten
more
runs
to
get
david
got
up
put
on
his
cap
and
then
with
great
deliberation
took
it
off
again
he
didn
t
know
if
he
wanted
a
cap
or
not
and
it
was
immensely
important
to
settle
that
it
was
sunny
but
the
sun
was
still
high
and
would
not
really
come
in
his
eyes
but
he
certainly
wanted
something
to
drink
for
his
throat
had
suddenly
become
gritty
and
dry
like
the
side
of
a
and
he
wanted
to
run
away
and
hide
or
to
do
anything
in
the
world
rather
than
cross
that
interminable
stretch
of
grass
across
which
cruikshank
was
now
walking
but
as
soon
as
cruikshank
reached
the
pavilion
he
would
have
to
go
that
impossible
feat
had
to
be
accomplished
bags
had
been
sitting
by
him
thoughtfully
eating
cherries
after
david
had
refused
them
but
it
was
long
since
he
had
had
any
clear
consciousness
of
bags
or
of
any
one
else
except
those
white
figures
in
the
field
but
at
this
awful
moment
bags
proved
himself
a
friend
in
need
oh
david
how
ripping
it
will
be
he
said
in
a
voice
of
complete
conviction
that
you
and
maddox
win
match
for
up
till
that
moment
the
possibility
had
literally
not
entered
david
s
head
he
had
been
entirely
absorbed
in
the
prospect
of
losing
it
for
them
but
this
suggestion
put
a
little
bit
of
heart
into
him
instead
of
the
cold
fear
by
gad
he
said
and
drawing
a
long
breath
went
down
the
steps
on
to
the
level
field
the
moment
he
got
moving
even
though
he
was
only
moving
to
the
place
of
execution
he
found
that
it
was
not
so
impossible
as
it
had
appeared
in
anticipation
it
had
seemed
out
of
the
question
at
this
crucially
critical
period
in
the
history
of
cricket
which
was
more
important
than
the
history
of
the
world
to
face
this
but
now
there
he
was
going
out
all
alone
bat
in
hand
and
he
did
not
sink
into
the
earth
or
fall
down
with
a
few
hollow
groans
and
then
two
other
things
encouraged
him
further
neither
of
which
he
had
contemplated
as
his
tall
slight
figure
detached
itself
from
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
pavilion
a
real
cheer
went
up
not
from
the
boys
of
his
house
only
but
from
the
school
in
general
he
told
himself
that
they
were
not
cheering
him
david
blaize
but
only
the
last
actor
in
this
enthralling
piece
of
drama
in
spite
of
which
he
felt
much
the
healthier
for
it
and
the
second
thing
that
encouraged
him
was
far
better
for
maddox
leaving
the
wicket
had
come
across
the
ground
to
meet
him
and
walk
back
with
him
david
old
chap
isn
t
it
ripping
he
said
even
as
bags
had
said
that
it
s
you
and
me
just
the
jolliest
thing
that
could
happen
don
t
bother
about
runs
they
ll
come
all
right
just
keep
your
end
up
and
don
t
take
any
risks
the
bowling
s
absolute
piffle
so
long
as
you
don
t
try
to
hit
then
they
had
to
part
company
each
going
to
his
wicket
there
were
so
david
remembered
with
hideous
distinctness
two
more
balls
of
the
over
and
after
taking
middle
and
leg
he
had
a
look
round
the
two
points
that
struck
him
most
were
that
the
other
wicket
seemed
nightmarishly
close
to
be
bowled
at
from
and
that
there
were
apparently
about
thirty
fielders
but
then
as
crawley
walked
away
to
get
his
run
the
rest
of
david
s
nerve
now
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
was
completely
restored
to
him
he
had
never
felt
cooler
nor
clearer
of
eye
in
his
life
he
received
his
first
ball
at
first
he
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
but
then
he
saw
it
was
a
yorker
he
saw
it
in
time
and
he
heard
sweet
as
honey
to
the
mouth
the
chunk
with
which
it
hit
the
centre
of
his
bat
close
to
the
end
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
about
the
second
ball
it
was
a
half
volley
well
outside
his
david
made
one
futile
attempt
to
be
prudent
and
resist
the
temptation
but
he
was
quite
incapable
of
it
danced
out
a
yard
and
smote
for
all
he
was
worth
he
heard
the
solid
impact
of
the
bat
telling
him
he
had
hit
it
correctly
was
the
ball
already
beyond
and
high
above
it
was
not
worth
while
starting
to
run
since
this
was
a
if
ever
there
was
one
more
was
the
end
of
the
over
opposite
he
saw
maddox
shaking
his
fist
at
him
as
the
roar
of
applause
went
up
mingled
with
shouts
from
his
particular
friends
of
well
hit
blazes
smack
em
about
david
and
he
swaggered
out
of
his
ground
to
slap
a
perfectly
true
place
on
the
wicket
with
his
bat
he
looked
up
with
a
deprecatory
smile
at
frank
sorry
i
had
to
he
said
you
little
devil
said
the
other
a
silence
more
intense
than
ever
settled
down
over
the
ground
as
the
last
shouts
consequent
on
david
s
immortal
feat
died
away
for
tomlin
proceeded
to
send
down
perhaps
the
best
over
he
had
ever
bowled
in
his
life
once
he
completely
beat
maddox
and
must
have
shaved
the
varnish
off
his
bails
and
from
the
rest
the
batsman
made
no
attempt
to
score
being
quite
satisfied
with
stopping
them
at
the
end
anstruther
looked
round
the
field
wace
take
an
over
at
crawley
s
end
will
you
he
said
then
that
period
deadly
for
a
newly
arrived
batsman
had
to
be
gone
through
when
the
fresh
bowler
has
a
few
and
rearranges
the
field
and
it
made
david
fret
had
to
be
moved
two
yards
nearer
and
one
yard
to
the
right
had
to
go
much
deeper
point
had
to
come
in
a
little
and
the
slips
went
through
a
mystic
dance
this
being
concluded
wace
proceeded
david
opened
with
an
appalling
stroke
that
would
have
been
easily
caught
by
cover
if
only
wace
had
not
moved
him
and
thereupon
wace
brought
him
in
again
so
david
with
an
even
worse
stroke
spooned
the
ball
over
his
head
so
that
if
he
had
not
been
moved
the
second
time
he
must
have
caught
it
for
this
he
scored
one
amid
derisive
and
exultant
yells
and
maddox
hit
at
him
with
his
bat
as
they
crossed
each
other
and
there
were
four
more
runs
to
get
then
the
end
came
maddox
played
two
balls
with
great
care
and
the
unfortunate
wace
then
sent
him
a
full
pitch
to
leg
there
came
the
sound
of
the
striking
bat
next
moment
the
ball
bounded
against
the
palings
by
the
pavilion
and
maddox
had
played
his
last
frank
waited
to
see
the
ball
hit
the
palings
and
then
ran
across
the
pitch
to
david
didn
t
i
tell
you
so
he
said
and
wasn
t
it
ripping
that
you
and
i
should
do
that
hullo
they
re
coming
for
us
let
s
all
round
the
ground
the
crowd
had
broken
up
wildly
shouting
some
going
towards
the
pavilion
but
others
headed
by
a
detachment
from
adams
s
streaming
out
on
to
the
pitch
the
two
boys
ran
towards
the
pavilion
dodging
the
first
few
of
these
but
both
were
caught
and
carried
in
starfishwise
then
again
and
again
first
maddox
alone
then
both
together
they
had
to
come
out
on
to
the
balcony
while
the
house
and
school
generally
shouted
itself
hoarse
for
this
entrancing
finish
indeed
the
honours
were
fairly
divided
for
if
maddox
s
batting
had
saved
the
situation
the
situation
would
have
been
impossible
to
save
if
it
had
not
been
for
david
s
bowling
yesterday
then
by
degrees
the
crowd
dispersed
and
the
shouting
died
and
the
two
sat
for
a
while
there
the
happiest
pair
perhaps
in
all
england
blunt
and
telegraphic
with
each
other
david
you
little
devil
said
frank
frightful
cheek
your
hitting
that
four
second
ball
you
received
david
gave
a
cackle
of
laughter
don
t
rub
it
in
he
said
i
apologised
juicy
shot
too
i
say
tomlin
sent
you
down
an
over
of
corkers
after
nearly
spewed
with
anxiety
said
frank
absolute
limit
of
an
wicked
fellow
tomlin
quoth
david
glad
i
didn
t
get
any
of
so
m
i
damn
glad
of
course
nobody
can
bat
except
yourself
said
david
you
can
t
but
we
ve
have
we
really
don
t
interrupt
i
should
have
added
that
you
can
you
can
t
said
david
getting
level
no
filthy
exercise
i
ll
take
you
down
to
bathe
if
you
don
t
bar
washing
and
then
i
ll
take
you
to
school
shop
and
you
may
eat
all
there
is
lucky
i
m
right
oh
thanks
awfully
said
david
but
you
won
t
be
flush
they
got
up
to
go
but
at
the
door
maddox
paused
best
of
all
the
days
i
ve
had
at
school
david
he
said
same
here
said
david
school
bathing
did
not
begin
for
another
hour
but
maddox
had
the
privilege
of
bathing
whenever
he
chose
and
adams
whom
they
ran
to
catch
up
on
their
way
down
gave
david
leave
to
go
with
him
he
had
dutifully
and
delightedly
watched
every
ball
of
the
match
and
had
helped
to
carry
david
into
the
pavilion
as
there
was
no
chance
of
assisting
at
the
entry
of
maddox
yes
by
all
means
yes
blest
pair
of
sirens
he
said
quoting
from
the
milton
ode
which
was
to
be
sung
at
concert
at
the
end
of
the
term
and
take
care
of
david
jonathan
and
don
t
let
him
sink
from
being
with
pride
we
shall
want
him
to
bowl
next
they
trotted
on
for
a
little
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
in
the
greatest
possible
heat
i
say
wasn
t
that
ripping
of
him
said
david
didn
t
know
he
knew
we
were
jolly
cute
observed
maddox
but
how
did
he
know
we
don
t
go
about
together
in
public
lord
here
s
the
head
coming
lucky
i
ve
got
they
had
gone
through
the
gate
into
the
master
s
garden
beyond
which
lay
the
this
was
penetrable
only
by
masters
and
by
the
and
there
was
no
turning
back
or
avoiding
what
was
to
david
a
rather
formidable
meeting
it
was
quite
illogical
that
he
should
find
it
so
since
he
had
leave
but
he
had
not
met
the
head
since
the
interview
in
the
disused
and
the
halo
of
terror
still
shone
about
his
head
he
nodded
kindly
to
the
boys
as
they
dropped
into
walking
pace
and
took
their
caps
off
and
then
stopped
fine
innings
of
yours
maddox
he
said
i
congratulate
you
you
too
blaize
a
lot
to
expect
wasn
t
it
that
you
should
bowl
tovey
s
eleven
out
one
day
and
keep
up
your
wicket
to
win
the
match
the
next
very
glad
you
did
it
david
still
rather
awed
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
thanks
awfully
sir
he
said
ve
got
leave
to
bathe
from
the
head
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
a
certain
merriment
lurking
below
his
gravity
quite
sure
he
asked
david
saw
this
was
a
joke
and
laughed
i
want
just
a
word
with
you
maddox
said
the
head
will
you
go
on
blaize
the
head
waited
a
moment
it
s
about
blaize
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
maddox
he
said
how
is
he
getting
on
i
had
to
give
him
a
good
whipping
last
term
is
he
rational
he
s
come
on
tremendously
sir
said
maddox
he
s
getting
on
i
m
glad
you
think
that
because
i
believe
he
s
one
of
the
most
promising
boys
we
ve
got
and
you
know
him
i
should
think
better
than
any
of
maddox
wondered
how
on
earth
the
head
knew
that
adams
might
know
but
how
did
the
head
i
don
t
want
his
cricket
to
interfere
with
his
work
he
said
the
middle
fifth
had
to
write
an
essay
last
week
and
i
told
howliss
to
send
them
in
to
me
to
look
over
all
but
two
or
three
were
dreadful
rubbish
but
blaize
s
was
excellent
and
as
you
re
a
trinity
scholar
as
well
as
being
captain
of
the
eleven
you
can
see
my
point
of
view
do
you
think
he
s
getting
cricket
out
of
focus
he
ought
to
be
higher
in
his
form
you
maddox
shook
his
head
oh
i
don
t
think
blaize
is
a
bit
unbalanced
about
his
cricket
sir
he
said
i
always
rub
it
in
that
cricket
doesn
t
matter
at
least
i
usually
do
though
i
didn
t
because
i
couldn
t
after
he
d
bowled
like
that
but
i
ll
rub
it
in
again
after
why
after
asked
the
head
because
i
was
going
to
put
him
into
the
sir
though
he
doesn
t
know
yet
and
i
must
let
him
enjoy
it
a
bit
and
then
there
s
the
eleven
against
the
sixteen
on
saturday
next
and
after
his
whole
record
in
it
s
just
a
question
whether
he
oughtn
t
to
play
for
the
eleven
there
are
four
places
the
trinity
scholar
had
certainly
got
absorbed
in
the
captain
of
the
eleven
you
mean
he
has
a
chance
of
his
asked
the
head
yes
sir
if
he
goes
on
developing
like
this
said
maddox
it
s
five
weeks
yet
to
the
lords
match
and
it
s
easily
possible
he
may
be
the
best
slow
bowler
in
the
maddox
paused
a
moment
he
ll
have
to
practice
a
lot
he
said
and
he
ll
have
to
think
about
it
a
lot
of
a
slow
bowler
is
brains
you
know
sir
or
would
you
rather
i
didn
t
try
to
bring
him
on
at
cricket
he
wouldn
t
notice
he
hasn
t
the
slightest
idea
how
good
he
is
and
even
if
he
well
said
the
head
maddox
dropped
the
surname
altogether
you
see
david
s
the
best
chap
who
ever
lived
he
said
and
we
re
tremendous
friends
if
i
didn
t
put
him
in
the
even
he
d
think
it
was
perfectly
all
right
as
you
ve
talked
to
me
about
him
sir
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
ll
do
what
you
think
best
for
him
i
should
naturally
put
him
into
the
this
evening
because
he
deserves
it
and
as
i
said
i
was
thinking
of
playing
for
the
eleven
next
week
but
if
you
think
not
if
you
think
it
would
do
him
more
good
all
round
to
be
kept
back
well
i
will
but
there
s
no
fellow
in
the
school
less
uppish
if
you
mean
that
was
all
the
head
wanted
he
had
got
at
david
s
character
as
seen
by
maddox
with
far
more
completeness
than
maddox
knew
do
just
what
seems
best
to
you
as
captain
of
the
eleven
he
said
but
there
are
lots
of
you
fellows
who
want
watching
and
it
takes
work
off
my
shoulders
if
i
know
that
you
elder
and
steady
men
are
doing
some
watching
for
me
good
luck
to
both
of
you
if
you
live
till
ninety
you
ll
never
find
a
better
thing
than
a
friend
at
least
i
haven
maddox
found
david
wallowing
in
the
tepid
water
and
at
intervals
making
hazardous
experiments
from
the
high
this
was
instructive
as
showing
the
flight
of
heavy
bodies
through
space
and
was
occasionally
followed
by
further
interesting
results
as
showing
what
happened
when
these
heavy
bodies
flatly
met
a
flat
and
incompressible
material
thereafter
they
went
to
school
shop
and
david
ate
his
way
so
to
speak
from
in
at
one
door
to
out
at
the
other
this
was
a
long
and
sumptuous
process
for
the
place
was
full
and
congratulations
were
hurled
at
them
tomlin
the
diabolical
was
there
among
the
crowd
taking
his
defeat
in
a
manner
thought
you
had
me
once
or
twice
during
your
last
over
said
maddox
to
him
fiendish
over
tommy
considered
this
twasn
t
a
very
bad
one
he
said
i
think
i
should
have
liked
to
have
sent
it
down
to
blaize
instead
of
you
jolly
good
match
though
hullo
blaize
you
re
a
rotten
bad
bat
you
know
i
ll
stand
you
both
it
was
perfectly
impossible
for
david
not
to
feel
elated
at
sitting
down
to
with
two
members
of
the
eleven
in
the
full
light
of
day
and
in
sight
of
the
school
generally
or
having
dreamed
night
and
day
of
being
some
good
in
not
to
feel
exalted
when
those
dreams
had
merged
into
realities
that
so
far
exceeded
all
his
imaginings
but
in
a
little
while
maddox
and
tomlin
began
to
speak
in
undertones
and
david
rose
with
the
sense
that
private
conversation
was
going
forward
i
think
i
ll
be
getting
back
to
house
he
said
thanks
awfully
for
the
wait
a
minute
said
maddox
i
m
coming
down
in
a
second
go
and
blow
yourself
out
a
little
david
thought
it
the
part
of
wisdom
not
to
do
that
and
strolled
outside
to
wait
for
his
friend
glorious
as
all
those
things
had
been
there
was
nothing
so
glorious
as
that
frank
and
he
had
been
associated
in
them
that
friendship
meant
more
to
him
than
cricket
or
this
sort
of
open
recognition
of
itself
till
now
their
ages
and
places
in
the
school
had
necessarily
divided
them
in
public
and
so
it
was
best
of
all
the
delicious
happenings
when
frank
joined
him
and
they
went
off
together
the
head
asked
after
you
this
afternoon
david
said
frank
made
inquiries
i
told
him
you
were
fairly
david
did
not
rise
at
this
you
always
stick
up
for
a
chap
he
observed
anything
else
yes
i
may
as
well
tell
you
as
everybody
else
will
know
by
fact
is
i
m
putting
you
into
the
and
on
saturday
next
week
you
re
playing
in
the
eleven
and
sixteen
match
for
the
david
stopped
quite
dead
and
then
he
thought
he
saw
frank
had
tried
to
get
a
rise
out
of
him
just
now
and
failed
and
of
course
was
trying
again
it
wasn
t
really
quite
nice
of
him
to
try
to
get
a
rise
out
of
him
over
such
matters
but
then
he
didn
t
know
how
dreadfully
david
cared
oh
jolly
funny
he
said
and
walked
on
again
david
do
you
think
i
m
such
a
brute
as
to
try
to
get
a
rise
out
of
you
with
that
sort
of
thing
asked
frank
do
you
mean
it
s
true
asked
david
suddenly
stammering
yes
you
ass
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
consult
tommy
about
and
he
agrees
we
can
t
have
a
kid
like
you
bowling
the
eleven
out
so
you
ve
jolly
well
got
to
bowl
the
sixteen
out
instead
and
i
ll
take
away
your
cap
if
you
don
oh
frank
i
can
t
quite
believe
it
said
david
what
s
it
all
for
what
have
i
done
that
s
one
of
your
bad
points
as
i
told
the
head
said
frank
i
said
you
were
filthily
lord
said
david
well
congratters
on
your
and
you
can
bring
your
preparation
to
my
study
if
you
like
and
i
ll
give
you
a
construe
i
haven
t
got
any
work
to
do
comes
of
being
a
scholar
of
trinity
remarked
david
and
fled
frank
had
written
out
the
list
of
promotions
into
the
when
david
came
to
his
study
with
a
copy
of
≈ìdipus
coloneus
which
was
his
lesson
for
next
day
and
he
pushed
it
over
to
him
i
ve
stuck
you
in
first
he
said
to
prepare
for
your
appearance
next
saturday
now
we
ll
leave
the
silly
business
alone
what
s
your
work
≈ìdipus
coloneus
yes
lines
of
a
chorus
that
s
simply
beastly
said
david
finding
his
place
there
line
frank
looked
over
his
shoulder
oh
it
s
not
without
merit
he
said
now
look
out
every
word
you
don
t
know
and
then
try
to
make
something
of
it
for
half
an
hour
after
that
i
ll
give
you
a
construe
no
oh
won
t
you
construe
it
first
asked
david
it
ll
save
me
a
lot
of
and
did
you
suppose
i
wanted
to
save
you
trouble
asked
frank
david
sighed
thought
you
might
he
said
it
s
rather
flat
working
after
this
no
it
isn
t
you
ve
got
to
learn
that
people
like
sophocles
matter
more
than
any
silly
twasn
t
a
silly
said
david
don
t
talk
david
looked
round
lend
me
your
dictionary
then
he
said
i
ve
left
mine
in
my
david
had
a
very
vivid
sense
of
the
beauty
of
words
and
though
it
took
him
some
time
to
whistle
his
mind
away
from
the
splendours
of
the
afternoon
and
from
the
glories
of
that
list
that
lay
on
the
table
which
would
soon
be
displayed
before
the
eyes
of
the
entire
school
he
became
conscious
before
long
that
the
words
of
the
beastly
chorus
which
was
open
before
him
were
beautiful
things
and
that
their
meanings
so
his
dictionary
told
him
were
beautiful
also
for
it
was
all
about
horses
and
nightingales
and
thickets
and
ivy
the
colour
of
was
rather
puzzling
unless
perhaps
it
meant
de
clustering
narcissus
then
by
degrees
he
became
absorbed
in
it
and
all
the
time
was
slightly
ashamed
at
being
able
to
be
interested
in
a
mere
greek
chorus
when
his
name
lay
on
the
table
as
heading
the
list
of
promotions
into
the
but
his
absorption
gained
on
him
why
it
s
ripping
he
said
to
himself
under
his
breath
and
whistling
softly
hunted
up
another
jewel
of
a
word
then
he
lost
himself
again
diving
into
wonderful
translucent
depths
gosh
i
ve
done
more
than
lines
he
said
at
length
and
i
never
noticed
i
say
give
me
a
construe
frank
i
ve
been
more
than
half
an
hour
i
want
to
hear
how
it
sounds
in
frank
drew
his
chair
up
to
david
s
so
that
they
could
both
share
the
same
book
right
oh
he
said
but
let
me
read
it
through
this
was
the
education
of
david
and
frank
was
tremendously
anxious
to
construe
the
beautiful
passage
well
and
he
took
some
five
minutes
more
going
over
it
while
david
s
glance
fed
on
the
list
of
the
promotions
then
he
began
stranger
he
said
blast
it
that
won
t
do
it
sounds
guest
suggested
david
yes
that
s
better
o
guest
in
this
land
of
horsemen
thou
hast
come
to
the
most
fair
of
earth
s
homes
to
gleaming
kolonos
frequented
by
the
nightingale
that
bubbles
liquidly
in
the
shelter
of
green
glades
making
his
habitation
amid
the
ivy
and
the
untrodden
bowers
of
the
god
unseen
of
the
sun
where
dionysus
master
of
revels
ever
treads
companied
by
the
nymphs
that
nursed
said
david
pushing
back
his
yellow
hair
and
still
rather
shy
of
liking
this
and
fed
with
heavenly
dew
the
sweet
clusters
of
the
narcissus
are
flowering
morn
by
morn
the
immemorial
crown
of
the
great
goddesses
and
the
crocus
is
nor
dwindle
ever
the
sleepless
springs
whence
come
the
wandering
waters
of
the
kephissus
but
every
day
he
flows
in
stainless
tides
over
the
plains
of
earth
s
ripening
bosom
giving
speedy
increase
nor
have
the
choirs
of
muses
abhorred
the
spot
nor
maddox
paused
that
s
your
lines
he
said
oh
ripping
said
david
it
really
is
absolute
do
go
i
told
you
it
had
merit
said
frank
and
proceeded
to
the
end
of
the
chorus
why
it
s
better
than
atalanta
said
david
at
the
conclusion
despite
his
barbarian
instinct
that
things
like
the
beauties
of
greek
literature
might
perhaps
be
thought
about
but
hardly
talked
of
maddox
however
had
no
such
notions
of
course
it
is
he
said
and
some
time
if
you
work
frightfully
hard
and
love
it
all
you
ll
find
as
the
head
told
us
the
other
day
that
you
simply
laugh
at
the
thought
of
translating
it
at
all
you
ll
know
it
can
t
be
translated
and
that
will
be
the
reward
of
your
work
for
it
will
mean
that
greek
has
got
into
your
blood
that
it
s
part
of
do
you
mean
the
head
s
like
that
asked
david
all
the
same
i
think
i
would
sooner
translate
it
like
you
don
t
understand
but
you
would
if
you
had
heard
him
the
other
day
we
had
a
plato
lesson
with
him
but
instead
of
going
through
a
single
line
of
it
something
set
him
off
and
he
talked
to
us
for
the
whole
hour
about
athens
and
the
life
they
led
there
you
never
heard
anything
so
splendid
you
could
go
up
to
the
acropolis
in
the
morning
and
look
at
the
frieze
pheidias
had
put
up
in
the
parthenon
a
procession
of
horses
and
boys
riding
to
the
temple
on
athene
s
birthday
he
showed
us
pictures
of
it
some
were
mounted
lord
they
had
good
others
were
still
putting
their
horses
bridles
on
and
one
horse
was
rubbing
its
foreleg
with
its
nose
or
t
other
way
pheidias
asked
david
yes
biggest
sculptor
there
s
ever
been
far
ahead
of
michelangelo
or
rodin
or
any
one
and
when
you
had
seen
that
you
and
your
and
me
that
sit
on
the
wall
of
the
acropolis
looking
over
the
town
out
to
the
mountains
the
purple
crown
of
mountains
as
they
called
them
hymettus
where
the
honey
came
from
and
pentelicus
where
they
got
the
marble
for
the
parthenon
and
another
s
its
name
parnes
then
to
the
south
you
would
look
over
the
sea
all
blue
and
dim
out
towards
salamis
which
as
the
head
said
was
the
trafalgar
of
athens
where
they
beat
those
stinking
persians
and
then
we
should
lunch
off
grapes
and
figs
and
cheese
wrapped
up
in
and
yellow
wine
and
go
down
to
the
theatre
just
below
to
hear
perhaps
this
very
play
by
sophocles
first
performance
and
no
end
of
an
excitement
then
perhaps
we
should
see
pericles
awfully
handsome
chap
and
the
biggest
prime
minister
there
ever
was
and
a
queer
ugly
fellow
would
go
by
who
would
be
socrates
and
all
the
boys
and
young
men
were
fearfully
keen
about
games
quite
as
keen
as
we
are
because
they
used
to
date
the
year
by
the
olympic
games
same
as
we
use
or
lord
i
m
jawing
i
wish
i
could
tell
it
you
as
the
head
oh
go
on
said
david
well
it
wasn
t
only
games
that
they
were
so
keen
about
they
loved
sculpture
and
painting
and
writing
so
much
that
no
one
ever
touched
them
at
it
before
or
since
it
was
the
consummate
age
so
the
head
said
and
then
when
it
came
to
fighting
a
little
potty
place
like
attica
no
bigger
than
a
small
english
county
just
wiped
the
persians
up
in
everything
so
the
head
told
us
the
athenians
of
the
great
age
were
the
type
of
the
perfect
physical
and
intellectual
life
oh
david
let
s
save
up
and
go
to
rather
but
why
did
the
romans
walk
over
them
frank
got
up
the
bell
for
chapel
had
begun
because
they
became
corrupt
and
what
an
awful
pity
i
say
you
made
me
feel
awfully
keen
with
that
construe
and
telling
me
what
the
head
said
i
haven
t
thought
about
the
ten
minutes
and
one
s
got
to
try
to
get
at
it
all
by
sapping
yes
that
s
how
you
ll
get
to
love
sounds
almost
worth
while
said
david
but
they
liked
games
as
well
that
s
a
frank
took
up
his
straw
hat
he
took
up
also
the
list
that
lay
on
the
table
come
on
he
said
i
want
to
put
this
up
on
the
before
oh
don
t
said
david
all
the
fellows
will
see
it
and
i
shall
turn
crimson
when
we
stand
up
for
the
bosh
every
one
expects
david
s
volatile
mind
went
back
to
the
greek
talk
pheidias
was
it
he
said
yes
said
frank
david
usually
a
solid
sleeper
could
not
take
his
usual
plunge
into
the
dim
depths
that
night
on
getting
into
bed
but
he
did
not
make
any
particular
effort
to
do
so
for
it
was
really
waste
of
time
not
to
lie
awake
when
there
were
so
many
delightful
things
to
think
about
round
and
round
in
his
head
they
turned
like
some
bright
wheel
and
now
it
was
the
events
of
the
last
three
days
in
other
words
now
the
more
immediate
happenings
of
the
evening
his
promotion
into
the
and
the
much
huger
honour
of
playing
for
the
eleven
next
week
that
sparkled
on
the
wheel
or
again
this
sudden
illumination
with
regard
to
the
greeks
fed
his
contemplation
up
till
now
it
had
not
been
real
to
him
that
the
people
who
wrote
these
tedious
or
difficult
things
which
he
had
to
learn
were
once
as
alive
as
himself
or
that
beauty
had
inspired
them
to
make
plays
and
statues
even
as
beauty
had
inspired
keats
and
swinburne
until
frank
had
given
him
the
gist
of
the
head
s
discourse
he
never
thought
of
those
plays
as
being
performed
in
a
theatre
before
an
audience
who
had
not
to
look
up
words
and
learn
the
grammar
and
consider
what
governed
an
apparently
isolated
genitive
or
account
for
an
irregular
aorist
they
were
not
bookworms
and
scholars
but
men
and
boys
who
ran
races
and
crowned
the
victor
and
had
their
trafalgar
just
as
if
they
were
english
it
was
all
vague
but
decidedly
there
was
a
new
light
on
matters
concerning
sophocles
but
permeating
all
these
things
was
their
inspiring
spirit
frank
who
lay
in
the
bed
next
him
whose
face
he
could
dimly
see
in
the
light
from
the
unblinded
open
window
just
opposite
and
then
for
the
first
time
it
was
borne
in
upon
david
with
a
sense
of
reality
that
in
a
few
weeks
more
five
and
a
piece
to
be
accurate
frank
would
have
left
at
that
thought
all
the
pleasant
and
interesting
things
which
had
so
delightfully
entertained
this
waking
hour
was
struck
from
his
mind
and
he
sat
up
in
bed
giving
a
little
despairing
groan
hullo
said
frank
softly
you
awake
too
what
s
the
groaning
about
oh
nothing
said
david
lying
down
again
well
then
what
isn
t
it
about
david
slewed
round
in
bed
facing
him
as
he
leaned
on
his
elbow
it
s
only
five
weeks
to
the
end
of
the
half
he
whispered
you
don
t
come
i
know
it
s
foul
i
was
thinking
of
it
myself
it
s
been
keeping
me
david
was
silent
a
minute
then
frank
spoke
again
i
m
sorry
to
leave
for
a
whole
heap
of
reasons
he
said
one
more
than
what
s
that
said
david
fellow
called
blaize
thought
i
should
just
like
to
tell
you
now
don
t
groan
any
more
go
to
sleep
you
swell
in
the
right
oh
fellow
called
maddox
said
david
chapter
xiii
david
was
sitting
on
the
bank
below
the
pavilion
on
the
last
afternoon
of
the
term
waiting
for
frank
who
was
paying
certain
bills
in
the
town
to
join
him
and
take
his
cricket
things
away
to
save
time
david
had
packed
them
for
him
emptying
his
locker
into
his
and
now
it
and
his
own
ready
packed
lay
beside
him
on
the
grass
the
plan
was
to
sit
here
and
talk
till
began
when
they
would
take
their
belongings
down
and
leave
them
at
the
lodge
in
readiness
for
the
bus
to
the
station
next
morning
it
was
their
last
opportunity
of
being
alone
together
for
after
chapel
they
would
have
to
go
down
to
their
house
to
dress
for
concert
and
after
concert
was
the
in
honour
of
their
having
won
the
it
would
all
be
exceedingly
public
and
rejoiceful
and
frank
would
have
to
make
a
speech
and
david
was
afraid
he
would
want
to
groan
again
instead
of
applauding
which
was
quite
out
of
the
question
as
the
occasion
was
one
of
uproarious
mirth
the
last
five
weeks
had
passed
with
awful
speed
he
had
worked
a
good
deal
he
had
played
cricket
a
good
deal
and
though
he
had
not
got
into
the
eleven
everything
had
been
tremendously
prosperous
he
had
been
tried
twice
for
the
eleven
once
against
the
next
sixteen
once
against
a
team
of
old
boys
from
cambridge
and
in
both
matches
he
had
bowled
with
considerable
success
but
then
the
weather
had
changed
and
instead
of
the
dry
crumbling
wickets
which
suited
him
there
had
been
ten
days
rain
wickets
were
soft
and
slow
and
certainly
would
be
for
the
match
at
lords
the
day
after
and
david
had
become
about
as
much
use
as
a
practical
bowler
as
a
would
have
been
so
crawley
only
this
morning
had
been
given
the
last
place
in
the
eleven
which
was
absolutely
all
right
for
crawley
could
bat
as
well
and
in
the
last
school
match
had
both
taken
wickets
and
made
runs
the
slow
ground
suiting
his
style
in
both
respects
in
the
same
match
maddox
had
scored
a
hundred
in
his
inimitable
style
and
david
had
shouted
himself
hoarse
and
and
all
these
things
were
dead
and
done
with
apart
from
cricket
work
had
taken
up
a
good
deal
of
his
time
and
work
mere
silly
work
in
a
class
room
taken
by
howliss
had
assumed
a
different
aspect
this
had
all
come
out
of
that
talk
with
frank
when
he
translated
the
chorus
from
≈ìdipus
coloneus
on
which
occasion
david
had
realised
that
pheidias
was
a
real
person
and
pericles
a
real
prime
minister
and
that
socrates
was
jolly
to
young
fellows
and
told
them
heavenly
stories
about
the
gods
they
had
all
become
people
who
went
to
the
theatre
like
anybody
else
and
went
to
olympia
just
as
anybody
now
might
go
to
the
oval
and
had
like
aristophanes
who
made
just
the
same
sort
of
jokes
as
people
make
nowadays
out
of
that
evening
too
had
resulted
the
fact
that
david
instead
of
occupying
a
modest
and
unassuming
place
some
down
the
middle
fifth
had
heard
to
his
great
astonishment
his
name
read
out
at
the
top
of
that
distinguished
form
a
prize
was
the
consequence
of
that
presented
him
that
morning
at
by
a
royal
duchess
who
said
she
was
very
much
pleased
which
was
distinctly
civil
of
her
but
all
those
things
were
dead
also
they
had
happened
there
was
but
little
more
to
happen
little
that
mattered
there
was
the
concert
in
which
david
was
one
of
a
group
of
tenors
who
would
take
part
in
the
milton
ode
that
would
be
rather
jolly
there
was
a
delightful
passage
at
the
end
about
o
may
we
soon
renew
that
and
the
name
blest
pair
of
sirens
had
an
aroma
about
it
adams
had
quoted
it
to
him
and
maddox
just
after
match
when
he
had
asked
for
leave
to
go
down
to
bathe
what
a
good
day
that
had
been
perhaps
the
best
day
of
all
these
dead
days
then
after
the
concert
would
be
the
uproarious
with
a
farewell
speech
from
frank
david
felt
empty
inside
at
the
thought
the
field
was
speckled
with
groups
of
boys
straying
about
in
the
idleness
of
the
last
day
some
sat
on
the
grass
some
were
playing
and
all
seemed
unreasonably
cheerful
now
and
then
two
or
three
passed
near
him
and
he
exchanged
friendly
hullos
with
them
sometimes
they
would
ask
him
to
join
them
in
a
stroll
but
david
s
reply
was
always
the
same
sorry
but
i
promised
to
wait
here
for
a
then
bags
detached
himself
from
a
passing
group
and
sat
down
by
him
david
could
talk
to
him
with
freedom
oh
bags
i
feel
beastly
he
said
what
rot
the
end
of
term
is
but
you
re
going
to
have
rather
a
decent
time
aren
t
you
asked
bags
oh
yes
there
s
a
cricket
week
at
baxminster
and
they
ve
asked
me
to
play
in
two
matches
and
it
s
awfully
good
of
you
to
want
me
to
come
and
stay
with
you
i
ll
let
you
know
as
soon
as
ever
i
can
depends
on
my
pater
perhaps
we
re
all
going
to
come
whenever
you
like
said
the
faithful
bags
i
shall
be
at
home
all
the
holidays
i
think
you
might
enjoy
it
there
s
a
lot
of
in
august
you
know
and
some
partridges
in
is
it
easy
to
shoot
asked
david
lord
yes
i
get
on
all
right
and
i
haven
t
got
your
eye
well
it
s
awfully
good
of
you
i
should
like
to
come
if
i
may
but
i
don
t
care
about
anything
hump
i
bags
looked
out
over
the
of
the
midsummer
field
here
s
maddox
he
said
almost
running
wonder
what
he
s
in
such
a
hurry
david
sat
up
so
he
is
he
said
i
say
let
s
sit
next
each
other
at
take
a
place
for
me
if
you
get
in
first
i
m
a
singer
at
concert
and
singers
always
get
out
right
oh
said
bags
he
got
up
quite
slowly
and
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
david
that
he
should
not
skip
away
at
once
but
he
still
lingered
i
dare
say
maddox
is
coming
up
to
take
his
cricket
things
away
he
remarked
i
dare
say
that
s
it
said
david
by
a
stroke
of
providence
gregson
and
a
friend
came
by
at
this
moment
ripping
sport
said
gregson
come
on
bags
there
s
a
terrier
at
and
they
re
going
to
put
a
ferret
into
the
place
ll
be
alive
with
rats
coming
too
blazes
no
hate
rats
said
david
bags
departed
a
moment
after
frank
joined
david
just
nodded
to
him
and
sat
down
by
him
been
waiting
he
asked
sorry
i
couldn
t
get
through
with
my
jobs
before
have
you
stuck
my
things
into
my
bag
good
work
we
can
just
sit
here
till
yes
i
emptied
your
locker
said
david
i
stuck
everything
into
your
bag
old
shoes
old
cap
all
there
was
afraid
i
didn
t
pack
it
very
doesn
t
matter
said
frank
funny
that
there
should
be
an
old
cap
still
very
curious
said
david
precisely
frank
gave
a
short
little
laugh
it
s
all
pretty
beastly
isn
t
it
he
said
you
look
rather
depressed
too
but
there
s
the
to
cheer
you
oh
damn
the
said
david
frank
s
pretence
at
light
conversation
broke
down
tisn
t
as
if
we
were
going
to
lose
each
other
said
he
and
we
re
not
dead
either
of
us
david
do
buck
can
t
said
david
then
it
s
rotten
of
you
it
isn
t
a
bit
worse
for
you
than
me
you
ve
lots
of
things
in
front
of
you
you
ll
get
into
the
eleven
next
year
you
ll
get
into
the
sixth
at
christmas
if
you
try
you
ll
swagger
horribly
you
frank
could
not
manage
to
pump
up
any
more
consoling
reflections
they
were
all
beside
the
point
so
like
a
sensible
boy
he
left
them
alone
and
went
to
the
point
instead
david
old
chap
he
said
i
don
t
believe
two
fellows
ever
had
such
a
good
time
as
we
ve
had
and
it
would
be
rot
to
pretend
not
to
be
sorry
that
this
bit
of
it
has
come
to
an
end
i
dare
say
we
shall
have
splendid
times
together
again
but
there
s
no
doubt
that
this
is
over
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
equal
rot
not
to
feel
jolly
thankful
for
it
the
chances
were
millions
to
one
against
our
ever
coming
across
each
other
at
all
so
buck
up
as
i
david
had
rolled
over
on
to
his
face
but
at
this
he
sat
up
picking
bits
of
dry
grass
out
of
his
hair
yes
that
s
so
he
said
but
it
will
be
pretty
beastly
without
you
i
shan
t
find
another
friend
like
you
d
jolly
well
better
not
interrupted
frank
david
could
not
help
laughing
i
suppose
we
re
rather
idiots
about
each
other
he
said
i
dare
say
but
it
s
too
late
to
remedy
that
now
oh
david
it
s
a
good
old
place
this
look
at
the
pitch
there
what
a
lot
of
ripping
hours
it
s
given
to
generations
of
fellows
me
among
them
there
s
the
roof
of
the
house
through
the
trees
do
you
see
you
can
just
see
the
end
window
of
our
dormitory
i
wonder
if
happiness
soaks
into
a
place
so
that
if
the
famous
professor
oh
mammalian
blood
said
david
what
s
that
oh
yes
the
crime
at
naseby
same
one
i
wonder
if
he
would
find
a
lot
of
all
over
the
i
could
do
with
a
few
said
david
with
a
sudden
return
to
melancholy
no
you
couldn
t
you
ve
got
plenty
of
them
as
it
is
lord
there
s
that
rotten
speech
i
have
to
make
at
what
am
i
to
say
oh
usual
thing
say
adams
is
a
good
fellow
and
we
re
all
good
fellows
and
it
s
a
good
house
and
a
good
school
and
a
good
that
s
about
it
said
frank
oh
there
s
one
other
thing
david
look
after
jevons
a
bit
will
you
he
s
turning
into
rather
a
jolly
little
inky
little
beast
said
david
all
again
they
were
silent
for
a
while
rather
a
ripping
verse
in
the
psalms
this
morning
said
frank
at
length
was
there
i
wasn
t
well
it
seemed
rather
applicable
i
thought
for
my
brethren
and
companions
sake
i
will
wish
thee
just
as
if
the
other
david
not
you
was
talking
to
school
and
there
s
they
sat
still
a
moment
longer
then
frank
rose
we
must
go
david
he
said
wouldn
t
do
to
be
late
as
it
s
the
last
time
give
me
your
hands
i
ll
pull
you
david
stretched
out
his
great
brown
paws
and
frank
hauled
him
to
his
feet
david
stood
there
a
second
still
holding
good
old
psalm
he
said
chapter
xiv
david
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
in
his
s
study
one
afternoon
late
in
november
occasionally
reading
the
and
and
otherwise
listening
with
a
strong
inward
satisfaction
to
the
slinging
of
the
sleet
on
to
the
window
panes
which
as
pointed
out
by
lucretius
emphasises
the
warm
comfort
of
present
surroundings
he
had
a
large
foot
on
each
side
of
the
fire
just
below
the
and
a
large
cushion
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
no
intention
at
all
of
going
into
the
foul
cold
called
what
made
his
satisfaction
the
more
complete
was
that
a
notice
had
been
passed
round
at
hall
from
gregson
the
captain
of
the
house
at
football
that
every
one
had
to
go
out
for
a
run
with
a
view
to
keeping
in
training
for
and
it
added
to
david
s
pleasure
to
think
of
all
those
poor
wretches
plodding
through
the
rainy
sleet
and
the
mud
and
the
puddles
while
he
like
the
king
s
daughter
in
the
psalms
was
all
glorious
was
a
pal
of
david
s
had
called
him
by
all
the
insulting
names
he
could
think
of
when
david
had
absolutely
refused
to
obey
orders
and
the
end
of
it
had
been
that
david
had
picked
gregson
up
he
was
a
little
fellow
though
an
admirable
at
rugby
football
and
carried
him
all
the
way
upstairs
in
his
arms
and
round
each
dormitory
in
turn
to
show
him
that
he
was
in
perfectly
good
training
already
thereafter
he
had
taken
the
and
from
the
against
all
rules
and
retired
to
adams
s
study
to
spend
a
cosy
time
before
the
fire
adams
himself
came
in
before
long
and
david
pushed
his
chair
back
and
took
down
his
large
feet
so
that
he
did
not
usurp
the
whole
of
the
hearthrug
and
the
entire
warmth
of
the
fire
he
had
like
half
the
house
the
habit
of
sitting
in
adams
s
study
who
wanted
nothing
better
than
to
have
his
boys
about
not
gone
for
a
david
asked
he
no
sir
gave
me
adams
lit
his
pipe
and
sat
down
on
the
hearthrug
which
was
his
usual
place
on
what
grounds
he
asked
david
laughed
i
carried
him
round
the
house
sir
to
show
him
i
was
in
good
training
he
said
he
didn
t
mind
a
that
ll
do
for
my
text
said
adams
i
wanted
to
sermonise
you
that
s
the
sort
of
thing
david
that
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
do
you
are
rather
given
to
undermining
authority
it
doesn
t
set
a
very
good
example
and
though
you
probably
don
t
know
it
the
house
takes
its
tune
from
you
and
one
or
two
others
you
are
pals
with
gregson
i
know
and
that
s
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
support
him
and
while
i
m
on
the
subject
i
want
to
ask
you
not
to
swear
so
david
sat
up
in
astonishment
sir
i
bet
you
ve
never
heard
me
swear
he
said
i
know
i
haven
t
but
i
ve
heard
young
jevons
and
i
draw
the
perfectly
correct
conclusion
that
you
do
i
m
awfully
grateful
by
the
way
for
your
taking
him
up
as
you
ve
done
and
teaching
him
to
wash
his
hands
and
not
look
as
if
everybody
wanted
to
thrash
him
did
anybody
suggest
it
to
you
oh
yes
frank
said
david
well
you
ve
done
good
work
though
i
didn
t
mean
to
praise
you
but
jevons
copies
you
he
brushes
his
hair
like
you
and
whistles
between
his
teeth
or
tries
to
and
runs
instead
of
walking
and
as
i
say
swears
do
stop
it
will
you
he
was
leaning
out
of
his
study
window
yesterday
exchanging
compliments
with
somebody
and
i
never
heard
such
an
assortment
of
billingsgate
it
s
such
awfully
bad
form
you
know
also
the
sentiments
expressed
by
bad
language
are
not
i
ll
try
sir
said
david
never
thought
of
swearing
as
meaning
i
know
you
didn
t
i
never
said
it
was
the
expression
of
a
foul
mind
but
the
house
is
becoming
a
perfect
company
of
bargees
try
not
to
swear
yourself
and
kick
anybody
who
does
when
it
s
convenient
that
s
all
about
right
sir
said
david
then
there
s
another
thing
said
adams
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
the
court
of
appeal
i
ve
only
just
heard
about
it
and
i
don
t
think
i
like
david
frowned
this
wasn
t
his
idea
of
a
comfortable
afternoon
indoors
at
all
and
he
wished
he
had
gone
out
for
a
run
instead
of
carrying
plugs
round
the
house
i
don
t
think
i
can
sir
he
said
there
are
other
fellows
concerned
in
oh
i
know
that
the
court
is
you
and
gregson
and
bags
chiefly
you
that
s
why
i
asked
you
i
heard
about
it
from
the
head
he
doesn
t
like
it
either
i
said
i
would
go
into
the
matter
i
don
t
promise
that
he
won
t
as
i
suppose
that
little
beast
manton
told
him
remarked
david
i
don
t
agree
with
little
beast
said
adams
but
i
agree
that
probably
manton
told
him
i
really
don
t
see
what
else
the
head
of
the
house
could
do
now
i
want
to
hear
what
the
court
of
appeal
have
to
say
about
themselves
just
as
i
shall
want
to
know
what
the
prefects
say
about
them
gregson
and
bags
are
quite
safe
in
your
hands
as
perhaps
not
quite
you
can
trust
me
for
david
raised
himself
and
sat
with
crossed
legs
in
the
big
it
s
rather
a
long
story
sir
if
i
m
to
tell
it
from
the
beginning
he
said
never
well
you
see
sir
there
was
such
an
awful
change
in
the
house
when
frank
and
cruikshank
left
at
the
end
of
last
half
you
see
they
were
proper
prefects
they
used
their
authority
properly
and
it
was
jolly
well
necessary
to
respect
it
you
couldn
t
cheek
fellows
like
them
when
they
gave
orders
it
simply
couldn
t
happen
and
it
was
so
frantically
different
to
get
little
clever
squirts
like
manton
and
crossley
in
authority
instead
they
couldn
t
keep
order
a
hang
the
whole
house
would
have
been
out
of
hand
in
no
time
you
ll
see
that
the
court
of
appeal
was
really
meant
to
preserve
order
why
the
very
fags
used
to
laugh
at
them
one
of
them
put
soap
in
manton
s
kettle
one
day
and
when
it
boiled
it
came
bubbling
out
of
the
spout
like
blowing
you
never
saw
anything
so
funny
but
the
court
of
appeal
stopped
adams
preserved
his
gravity
that
s
rather
a
new
light
he
said
go
on
david
you
needn
t
bring
in
names
if
you
think
you
d
better
not
but
it
s
only
fair
that
the
head
should
know
your
side
of
the
question
as
he
has
heard
manton
david
got
red
in
the
face
manton
s
a
filthy
little
sneak
he
observed
also
i
bet
he
hasn
t
told
the
head
the
he
probably
told
him
the
truth
as
it
struck
him
said
adams
it
strikes
you
differently
but
he
didn
t
sneak
as
you
think
the
head
got
his
first
news
about
the
court
of
appeal
from
quite
another
may
i
know
what
source
asked
david
yes
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
but
you
must
be
officially
ignorant
jevons
went
to
breakfast
with
the
head
the
other
day
and
remarked
in
an
outburst
of
confidence
that
you
were
far
the
biggest
swell
in
the
house
because
you
were
the
president
of
the
court
of
appeal
he
said
it
in
all
innocence
but
the
head
was
naturally
interested
to
hear
more
and
applied
to
the
proper
quarter
which
was
david
recovered
from
his
spurt
of
temper
that
funny
little
jev
probably
thought
it
all
quite
regular
he
said
of
course
he
did
he
wouldn
t
have
given
you
away
on
purpose
go
on
we
ve
got
to
the
soap
in
the
david
laughed
yes
sir
you
should
have
seen
it
coming
all
rainbowy
out
of
the
spout
so
of
course
manton
sent
for
fellow
who
did
it
and
he
couldn
t
even
cane
him
alone
but
had
to
have
crossley
in
to
help
it
s
perfectly
degrading
sir
to
have
prefects
like
that
so
crossley
held
the
fellow
down
and
just
as
manton
began
to
lay
on
the
fellow
kicked
out
and
crossley
slipped
across
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
manton
landed
him
an
awful
wipe
over
the
shin
and
so
crossley
let
go
and
stamped
about
and
they
made
such
a
row
between
them
that
i
had
to
look
in
i
d
gone
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
sir
in
case
anything
funny
occurred
and
so
as
i
say
i
looked
in
and
there
was
name
slipped
out
by
to
burst
himself
with
laughing
and
the
kettle
boiling
over
again
with
and
crossley
hopping
about
on
one
leg
and
manton
apologising
to
him
and
then
manton
turned
on
me
and
told
me
i
was
undermining
discipline
so
i
had
to
say
there
seemed
a
precious
lot
of
discipline
to
undermine
and
then
manton
lost
his
presence
of
mind
and
whacked
out
again
at
babbington
and
missed
him
and
smashed
his
electric
light
o
lor
i
never
saw
anything
so
funny
david
shrieked
with
laughter
again
at
the
remembrance
and
adams
could
not
resist
joining
him
as
he
turned
to
beat
out
his
pipe
against
the
bars
of
the
fire
well
he
said
at
length
i
could
tell
you
heaps
of
stories
like
that
said
david
wiping
his
eyes
another
time
it
was
crossley
who
told
a
fellow
to
write
out
fifty
lines
so
he
wrote
out
fifty
lines
just
like
that
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
showed
it
up
fancy
doing
that
to
frank
or
crookles
why
you
couldn
t
and
then
crossley
told
him
to
write
them
out
twice
so
he
took
another
bit
of
paper
and
wrote
them
out
twice
on
it
and
then
crossley
said
he
would
cane
him
so
there
s
another
name
please
forget
it
came
and
appealed
precious
lot
of
good
that
did
him
for
the
court
were
satisfied
that
he
d
deserved
his
fifty
lines
and
so
i
gave
him
six
frightful
stingers
myself
as
i
knew
crossley
wasn
t
fit
to
for
cheek
to
a
prefect
and
yet
you
and
manton
say
i
m
undermining
discipline
sir
added
david
in
a
voice
of
outraged
virtue
why
we
re
enforcing
it
jev
had
to
write
out
his
hundred
lines
and
got
a
whacking
too
though
the
court
of
appeal
can
reverse
a
prefect
s
decision
it
also
may
enforce
it
and
then
appellant
gets
it
twice
as
hot
for
having
appealed
same
as
in
english
law
this
is
all
rather
news
to
me
remarked
adams
well
sir
something
had
to
be
done
said
david
or
the
whole
house
would
have
gone
to
pot
why
the
fags
might
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
to
cheek
fifth
form
next
when
they
d
finished
with
the
sixth
and
there
would
have
been
trouble
you
see
most
of
the
big
fellows
in
the
house
are
in
the
fifth
that
s
the
way
the
court
of
appeal
go
on
said
adams
well
the
next
thing
i
must
tell
you
night
a
couple
of
juniors
made
an
bed
for
gregson
awful
cheek
so
naturally
he
whacked
them
soundly
and
formally
and
they
went
to
manton
and
told
him
that
gregson
had
been
whacking
them
so
round
comes
manton
and
tells
gregson
before
the
whole
dormitory
and
him
captain
of
football
that
he
s
no
right
to
as
he
wasn
t
a
prefect
and
of
course
gregson
said
he
d
heard
that
a
little
before
manton
had
caned
crossley
that
was
the
babbington
affair
and
that
he
hadn
t
any
right
to
cane
a
prefect
that
s
the
sort
of
thing
that
went
on
all
the
first
weeks
of
this
half
sir
there
d
have
been
a
regular
revolution
unless
we
d
done
something
and
so
i
say
that
the
court
of
appeal
is
more
to
support
authority
than
the
other
way
well
now
we
ll
take
the
other
way
about
said
adams
i
mean
i
want
to
know
about
the
cases
in
which
you
upset
the
prefect
s
david
thought
for
a
moment
well
sir
those
two
manton
and
crossley
did
all
sorts
of
things
we
re
not
accustomed
to
have
prefects
doing
he
said
when
they
went
the
round
of
the
studies
during
preparation
to
see
that
we
were
working
they
used
to
put
on
slippers
and
open
the
door
quick
to
try
and
catch
you
doing
nothing
and
of
course
they
often
did
well
that
s
not
playing
the
game
sir
frank
always
came
clumping
along
and
he
always
tapped
at
your
door
it
was
just
the
same
when
they
went
the
rounds
of
dormitories
after
lights
were
out
slippers
you
don
t
do
any
good
by
spying
you
know
you
won
t
stop
fellows
ragging
anything
else
that
sort
of
way
it
only
means
that
two
can
play
at
that
game
and
if
you
want
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
that
you
shouldn
t
you
just
put
a
sentinel
at
the
door
spying
just
encourages
fellows
to
break
rules
smoking
well
smoking
said
adams
crossley
suspected
a
certain
fellow
of
smoking
and
one
day
when
he
was
out
he
went
and
looked
in
his
table
drawer
and
found
a
pipe
there
now
sir
that
sort
of
thing
s
all
rot
he
wanted
to
whack
him
for
it
and
the
fellow
appealed
so
naturally
we
gave
it
in
his
favour
when
it
came
out
that
crossley
had
looked
in
his
private
drawer
you
wouldn
t
dream
of
doing
it
yourself
sir
naturally
not
so
of
course
we
reversed
crossley
s
sentence
and
wouldn
t
let
him
be
did
you
three
appoint
yourself
the
court
asked
adams
yes
i
suppose
it
was
about
that
we
were
all
pals
you
see
sir
and
the
rest
of
the
house
seemed
satisfied
that
we
d
take
a
fairish
view
of
things
and
so
about
a
month
ago
after
we
d
settled
that
something
must
be
done
we
just
let
every
one
know
that
they
could
appeal
against
any
impot
or
caning
that
those
two
manton
and
crossley
proposed
to
give
and
we
would
decide
but
then
you
see
sir
if
any
one
appeals
as
i
said
and
the
court
upholds
the
prefect
he
gets
it
twice
as
hot
hundred
lines
instead
of
fifty
etcetera
we
ve
written
it
all
out
in
a
book
constitution
of
the
court
of
appeal
so
as
to
have
it
regular
and
in
case
we
good
gracious
it
s
a
constitution
is
it
asked
adams
david
became
slightly
dignified
yes
we
thought
it
better
to
put
it
on
an
orderly
footing
sir
he
said
and
have
everything
regular
so
that
we
shouldn
t
contradict
ourselves
and
do
one
thing
one
time
and
another
another
also
the
fellows
know
what
to
expect
and
what
s
more
we
see
that
the
impots
are
properly
done
if
we
confirm
them
canings
too
why
one
day
crossley
caned
a
fellow
began
to
bubble
with
laughter
and
he
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
and
snore
and
when
crossley
told
him
it
was
all
over
he
pretended
to
awake
and
said
hullo
morning
already
why
it
s
a
farce
sir
it
s
sheer
childish
what
s
the
use
of
caning
a
fellow
if
you
don
t
jolly
well
hurt
him
so
we
took
that
out
of
the
prefects
hands
and
the
impots
get
properly
written
and
fellows
get
properly
whacked
if
it
s
a
whacking
i
don
t
say
it
increases
the
respect
in
which
the
house
holds
those
two
little
fellows
at
the
top
but
surely
it
s
better
to
have
some
authority
than
none
adams
thought
over
this
for
a
while
the
head
had
apparently
been
given
to
understand
by
manton
that
the
authority
of
the
two
prefects
had
been
wrenched
out
of
their
hands
by
these
large
athletic
upstarts
of
the
fifth
form
and
that
in
consequence
anarchy
prevailed
and
the
house
had
become
a
sort
of
medmenham
abbey
but
david
s
account
had
put
a
perfectly
different
aspect
on
the
affair
and
one
that
was
eminently
reasonable
adams
was
a
man
and
putting
aside
altogether
the
fact
that
he
delighted
in
david
and
disliked
manton
he
believed
that
david
s
version
was
the
true
one
it
had
always
been
his
plan
to
let
the
house
look
after
its
own
affairs
as
far
as
possible
he
gave
it
home
rule
in
fact
and
certainly
the
transfer
of
government
to
the
fifth
form
though
highly
irregular
and
in
defiance
of
he
believed
to
have
been
distinctly
for
the
good
of
the
nation
again
a
thing
which
bore
out
this
view
the
first
weeks
of
the
half
had
been
full
of
trouble
and
worry
small
boys
were
for
ever
appealing
to
him
against
the
prefects
and
prefects
were
as
constantly
invoking
his
authority
to
endorse
their
own
lack
of
it
then
about
a
month
ago
all
these
disturbances
had
ceased
and
adams
with
his
habitual
optimism
had
supposed
that
the
house
had
shaken
down
together
now
but
in
the
light
of
all
this
it
seemed
far
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
remedy
had
been
brought
about
by
this
brigandage
of
authority
certainly
the
restoration
of
peace
and
quiet
was
coincident
with
the
establishment
of
this
impertinent
court
of
appeal
which
would
have
to
come
to
an
end
as
a
recognised
institution
but
during
its
existence
it
seemed
to
have
been
effective
do
you
reverse
many
of
the
prefects
rulings
asked
adams
oh
no
sir
not
now
said
david
anxious
to
do
such
justice
as
could
be
done
to
those
two
impotent
figureheads
you
see
neither
of
them
liked
their
silly
rulings
reversed
and
they
ve
become
much
more
sensible
but
you
simply
can
t
have
a
prefect
looking
in
your
study
when
you
re
out
and
wanting
to
cane
you
because
he
finds
a
pipe
there
fancy
frank
or
cruikshank
doing
a
scruggish
trick
like
that
you
seem
rather
fond
of
that
instance
said
adams
yes
sir
because
it
s
so
jolly
typical
said
david
adams
got
up
i
m
considering
what
to
say
to
the
head
he
remarked
i
shall
certainly
tell
him
there
s
another
side
to
the
question
besides
manton
oh
ripping
said
david
cordially
i
felt
sure
you
d
see
i
suppose
you
enjoyed
the
court
of
appeal
a
good
deal
he
asked
rather
sir
said
david
i
should
think
we
did
wish
you
could
have
heard
one
of
the
trials
with
us
three
on
the
bench
and
manton
as
defendant
and
some
junior
as
plaintiff
you
see
sir
manton
and
crossley
consented
to
it
all
that
s
another
point
in
our
favour
isn
t
it
gregson
planned
all
the
ritual
because
his
pater
s
a
real
judge
in
appeal
courts
and
we
call
each
other
my
learned
brother
crabtree
or
blaize
for
of
course
there
are
no
nicknames
or
christian
names
in
court
it
s
all
quite
serious
there
s
no
rag
about
it
we
were
thinking
of
appointing
a
permanent
counsel
to
plead
for
adams
laughed
david
you
don
t
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeal
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
remain
in
existence
he
asked
that
s
as
you
wish
sir
he
said
well
asked
adams
nothing
sir
i
was
only
thinking
that
there
ll
be
rather
rows
i
hope
not
said
adams
that
s
exactly
what
you
and
fellows
like
you
have
got
to
but
how
can
we
if
you
re
going
to
stop
it
asked
david
in
hundreds
of
ways
by
backing
the
prefects
up
without
them
you
re
sensible
enough
to
know
david
considered
this
is
the
head
sick
about
it
sir
he
asked
he
s
never
sick
about
anything
till
he
s
in
full
possession
of
the
facts
he
was
prepared
to
be
uncommonly
sick
when
he
had
only
heard
the
other
side
in
fact
he
said
something
about
giving
you
another
lesson
with
regard
to
obeying
authorities
but
after
what
you
ve
told
me
i
don
t
think
you
need
be
oh
i
m
not
said
david
of
course
he
ll
see
there
s
another
side
to
it
same
as
you
ve
done
something
had
to
happen
when
we
got
manton
and
crossley
instead
of
frank
and
at
this
moment
a
small
and
completely
soaked
boy
burst
into
the
room
not
seeing
adams
who
was
sitting
behind
the
door
but
only
david
letter
for
you
blaize
he
said
oh
and
i
want
to
appeal
sorry
sir
i
didn
t
see
you
do
now
jevons
said
adams
so
go
on
tell
blaize
what
the
appeal
s
well
sir
somebody
put
my
sponge
on
the
top
of
manton
s
door
made
a
and
because
it
s
my
sponge
he
says
i
m
responsible
unless
i
find
out
who
put
it
adams
nodded
to
david
go
on
learned
brother
blaize
he
said
notice
in
writing
jev
he
said
he
had
seen
the
handwriting
of
his
letter
and
tore
it
open
oh
i
say
how
ripping
he
said
frank
s
mother
s
ill
and
is
ordered
out
of
england
for
least
it
s
beastly
that
she
s
frank
wants
to
know
if
he
can
stay
with
us
for
a
week
i
say
jev
you
re
awfully
wet
aren
t
you
i
mean
you
couldn
t
get
much
wetter
so
i
wonder
if
you
d
take
a
tellywag
just
down
to
the
rather
and
i
ll
put
my
appeal
in
your
study
shall
i
right
i
ll
be
back
in
a
second
if
you
ll
have
your
tellywag
is
the
telegram
to
frank
saying
he
can
come
asked
adams
yes
then
hadn
t
you
better
write
to
your
father
first
it
might
not
be
the
impulsive
david
had
already
written
ripping
stay
as
long
as
you
can
but
he
paused
oh
well
i
suppose
it
would
be
best
sir
he
said
i
wish
you
hadn
t
thought
of
david
got
up
to
go
to
his
study
and
write
the
note
which
was
so
far
outstripped
by
his
desire
and
may
i
talk
to
bags
and
plugs
about
the
court
of
appeal
sir
he
said
certainly
you
can
talk
it
over
with
manton
too
if
you
like
in
fact
i
rather
recommend
adams
s
recommendation
seemed
to
be
rather
sensible
when
david
thought
over
it
though
not
perhaps
strictly
in
accordance
with
adams
s
idea
in
suggesting
it
it
would
give
the
court
an
opportunity
perhaps
of
finding
out
what
manton
had
said
to
the
head
and
should
manton
not
choose
to
tell
them
it
was
easy
to
threaten
as
a
that
the
court
when
called
upon
as
it
undoubtedly
would
be
to
appear
before
the
head
would
give
a
highly
coloured
account
strictly
based
upon
facts
of
what
had
led
to
its
formation
also
they
could
put
before
manton
and
crossley
a
very
depressing
picture
of
what
their
position
would
be
if
the
court
was
dissolved
and
privately
chose
not
to
back
up
their
restored
authority
it
required
but
small
imagination
to
picture
the
status
of
those
two
unfortunate
prefects
if
they
had
to
enforce
discipline
in
the
house
without
the
support
of
what
had
been
the
court
bags
and
gregson
had
just
come
in
from
their
run
and
gregson
being
in
his
bath
and
in
the
superior
position
of
having
no
clothes
on
could
take
reprisals
by
water
on
david
s
having
refused
to
go
out
david
in
fact
had
to
dodge
a
soaking
sponge
thrown
at
him
before
he
had
time
to
begin
to
explain
oh
a
minute
he
said
there
s
a
awful
serious
thing
happened
plugs
the
head
knows
all
about
the
court
of
appeal
and
it
s
goin
to
be
gone
rot
said
gregson
filling
his
sponge
again
now
who
wouldn
t
go
out
for
a
sweat
david
tisn
t
rot
shrieked
david
snatching
up
a
towel
to
shield
himself
i
swear
it
isn
t
while
you
brutes
have
been
having
an
innocent
happy
sweat
along
the
road
this
nice
weather
i
ve
been
jawed
by
adams
it
s
a
solid
fact
we
re
all
going
to
be
hauled
up
before
the
head
and
he
was
disposed
to
be
uncommonly
sick
about
it
so
adams
said
do
shut
up
being
funny
with
right
oh
said
plugs
if
you
swear
you
re
not
swear
said
david
hurry
up
and
dress
and
come
to
my
study
because
you
and
i
and
bags
have
to
talk
it
s
a
welter
of
the
court
accordingly
met
in
about
ten
minutes
time
in
david
s
study
where
he
had
made
tea
for
them
and
where
on
the
table
lay
jevons
s
appeal
he
laid
before
the
other
two
all
his
talk
with
adams
reproducing
it
with
laudable
accuracy
and
as
it
s
a
dead
cert
that
we
shall
appear
before
the
head
he
finished
up
we
ve
got
to
agree
exactly
what
we
say
we
mustn
t
give
different
accounts
of
bags
caressed
what
he
hoped
was
going
to
be
a
moustache
of
course
not
he
said
we
ve
just
got
to
say
what
s
happened
truth
whole
truth
and
nothing
oh
i
didn
t
mean
we
were
to
make
things
up
said
david
but
the
only
question
is
how
much
we
tell
the
head
i
vote
for
a
suggested
manton
and
crossley
and
see
if
we
can
t
let
each
other
down
compromise
out
of
court
suggested
plugs
yes
something
of
the
kind
we
can
give
them
away
hopelessly
by
saying
how
inefficient
they
were
and
they
can
give
us
away
by
saying
that
we
have
undermined
the
prefects
authority
don
t
you
see
it
might
all
be
toned
down
a
that
s
no
use
said
bags
if
manton
s
given
us
away
but
that
s
just
what
we
don
t
know
said
david
i
vote
we
try
to
get
manton
to
tell
us
what
he
told
the
head
he
may
not
have
told
him
much
he
may
have
said
it
was
an
amicable
sort
of
arrangement
on
the
other
hand
he
may
have
told
him
that
our
object
was
to
undermine
prefects
authority
well
as
i
told
adams
there
s
another
side
to
that
we
generally
supported
it
except
when
it
was
manifestly
unfair
i
want
to
know
what
manton
told
him
that
we
have
put
ourselves
above
the
prefects
is
true
but
we
did
it
in
the
cause
of
order
though
of
course
we
all
enjoyed
it
and
the
house
accepted
us
said
bags
lot
the
head
will
care
for
that
i
want
to
get
manton
and
crossley
to
come
and
talk
crossley
doesn
t
matter
but
manton
anyhow
as
he
s
already
seen
the
head
you
see
when
the
head
has
us
up
we
can
tell
him
a
lot
if
we
choose
he
ll
ask
us
for
our
account
of
it
manton
ll
see
that
he
isn
t
a
fool
though
he
is
such
a
with
plugs
as
well
as
bags
david
was
the
and
after
a
few
minutes
bags
went
to
manton
s
study
and
quite
politely
asked
him
to
come
round
and
confer
with
the
court
manton
rather
liked
this
he
promised
himself
a
pleasant
time
in
telling
the
court
that
the
head
was
going
into
the
whole
matter
himself
and
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
he
was
prepared
to
be
maliciously
civil
and
courteous
and
to
express
his
regret
the
court
had
made
such
an
ass
of
itself
as
its
spontaneous
generation
implied
he
thought
it
would
be
rather
fun
and
came
very
blandly
with
his
spectacles
on
and
a
book
that
he
was
reading
his
finger
kept
his
place
in
a
cursory
manner
here
i
am
he
said
hullo
blaize
hullo
gregson
yes
the
court
of
appeal
it
wasn
t
i
who
went
to
the
head
about
it
you
know
it
was
that
little
fellow
blaize
s
friend
who
let
it
out
what
s
his
name
i
oh
jevons
said
david
yes
jevons
told
the
head
about
it
and
so
of
course
the
head
asked
me
more
he
put
it
rather
nicely
he
said
it
was
my
business
to
tell
him
about
it
as
head
of
the
david
was
seated
between
his
two
learned
brothers
just
as
if
a
regular
court
was
going
on
oh
we
know
about
jevons
he
said
we
can
leave
jevons
waive
said
plugs
formally
yes
we
can
waive
jevons
said
david
as
my
learned
brother
manton
gave
a
little
cackle
of
laughter
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
you
had
to
waive
everything
he
observed
pleasantly
oh
we
re
not
going
to
waive
you
just
yet
if
you
count
for
anything
retorted
david
but
perhaps
you
don
t
count
for
bags
suddenly
laughed
in
a
hoarse
manner
i
beg
pardon
brother
blaize
he
said
right
oh
brother
crabtree
but
just
contain
yourself
well
manton
you
ve
been
to
the
head
with
your
version
and
next
we
go
to
the
head
with
ours
we
can
make
it
pretty
sultry
for
you
if
we
choose
and
we
shouldn
t
mind
doing
it
a
bit
but
it
all
depends
on
what
you
have
told
the
head
that
s
what
we
should
like
to
manton
still
felt
in
a
very
superior
position
all
he
had
told
the
head
was
quite
true
namely
that
these
three
boys
put
themselves
in
a
position
above
the
prefects
so
that
any
order
or
punishment
by
the
two
boys
in
the
house
could
be
appealed
against
and
if
they
thought
proper
could
be
reversed
the
head
had
been
extremely
grave
about
it
and
at
present
there
was
no
doubt
in
manton
s
mind
that
he
was
going
to
uphold
the
authority
of
the
prefects
in
a
summary
manner
and
probably
make
it
very
hot
for
those
who
had
set
themselves
above
it
he
felt
quite
secure
and
comfortable
and
smiled
in
rather
a
lofty
manner
i
dare
say
the
head
will
tell
you
as
much
of
what
i
said
as
he
thinks
good
for
you
he
observed
but
i
really
don
t
see
why
i
should
you
see
he
takes
the
view
that
prefects
are
not
to
be
dictated
to
by
two
or
three
members
of
the
fifth
form
bad
precedent
you
know
it
might
lead
to
a
couple
of
fellows
out
of
the
fourth
form
dictating
to
you
jevons
and
a
friend
might
make
a
of
appeal
rather
funny
that
would
david
passed
the
ghost
of
a
wink
to
gregson
he
wanted
to
draw
manton
on
a
little
further
before
he
unmasked
his
batteries
it
required
some
control
to
assume
an
attitude
of
humility
when
delicious
sentences
were
beginning
to
seethe
in
his
brain
but
it
was
heavenly
to
see
manton
s
malicious
little
eyes
beaming
at
him
through
his
spectacles
and
notice
what
an
awful
scug
he
looked
with
his
hair
rather
long
behind
lying
outside
his
collar
he
gave
a
sigh
i
say
i
m
afraid
we
re
in
for
it
he
said
disconsolately
manton
let
his
mouth
expand
into
an
odious
smile
yes
i
should
say
you
were
he
observed
you
see
the
head
s
view
is
that
the
authority
of
prefects
is
an
institution
which
has
his
support
and
he
doesn
t
quite
see
why
it
should
be
taken
away
by
three
fellows
in
the
fifth
he
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
and
so
i
had
to
give
him
a
pretty
full
account
i
should
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
think
if
i
were
david
could
stand
this
no
longer
he
felt
that
he
must
burst
if
he
had
to
listen
to
any
more
of
manton
s
advice
you
say
you
gave
him
a
pretty
full
account
he
said
though
you
have
not
chosen
to
tell
us
what
it
was
well
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
we
made
it
a
bit
fuller
for
you
i
beg
your
pardon
brother
bags
was
leaning
back
looking
dreamily
at
manton
learned
brother
gregson
he
observed
do
you
remember
one
day
how
manton
wanted
to
whack
a
little
boy
called
babbington
and
how
he
had
to
call
in
crossley
to
help
plugs
assumed
a
portentous
air
yes
brother
crabtree
he
said
and
how
came
out
of
manton
s
kettle
though
he
had
not
meant
to
david
chimed
in
and
we
all
remember
my
learned
brother
he
said
how
the
house
was
a
perfect
for
the
first
month
of
this
term
before
we
started
our
worshipful
court
and
david
turned
to
manton
perhaps
you
didn
t
tell
the
head
that
he
said
we
shall
we
shall
tell
him
how
you
couldn
t
get
lines
done
for
you
till
we
enforced
the
authority
you
hadn
t
got
we
shall
say
how
you
walk
round
the
house
in
slippers
and
when
you
get
back
to
your
own
fuggy
studies
you
daren
t
walk
straight
in
for
fear
of
finding
a
come
down
on
your
mangy
heads
jolly
wise
precaution
too
on
your
part
we
shall
tell
the
head
all
david
licked
his
lips
as
he
warmed
to
his
work
he
took
jevons
s
appeal
off
the
table
in
front
of
him
i
shall
take
this
to
the
head
and
read
it
him
he
said
just
listen
pretty
dignified
position
for
you
isn
t
it
to
the
court
of
appeal
please
blaize
manton
got
an
awful
soaker
because
somebody
else
put
my
sponge
on
the
top
of
his
door
which
soused
him
and
because
it
was
my
sponge
he
says
he
ll
whack
me
unless
i
find
out
who
did
it
and
tell
him
which
isn
t
fair
because
it
s
not
my
business
so
i
appeal
manton
was
getting
a
little
rattled
otherwise
he
would
not
have
done
anything
so
foolish
as
try
to
grab
this
paper
david
whisked
it
away
i
shall
say
too
that
you
tried
to
get
hold
of
this
he
said
better
sit
down
manton
that
s
right
and
i
shall
tell
him
that
your
notion
of
authority
is
to
look
in
a
fellow
s
private
drawer
when
he
s
out
to
see
if
you
can
nail
a
i
never
did
said
manton
wildly
that
was
oh
then
i
suppose
crossley
will
explain
that
said
david
of
course
it
may
all
be
stale
news
to
the
head
since
you
gave
him
a
pretty
full
account
but
i
ll
just
see
if
the
head
happened
to
listen
to
that
part
you
see
we
don
t
in
the
least
mind
telling
you
what
we
re
going
to
say
to
the
head
though
you
re
too
superior
to
tell
us
what
you
said
i
ve
told
adams
about
it
already
and
he
thinks
you
re
an
awfully
good
prefect
of
course
and
then
you
see
concluded
david
cheerfully
when
we
ve
told
him
all
that
really
happened
why
shouldn
t
we
make
up
a
lot
that
didn
t
probably
you
did
the
same
gosh
the
head
will
have
a
wonderful
high
opinion
of
you
before
i
ve
done
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
isn
t
more
than
he
can
bear
and
jolly
well
breaks
down
and
sobs
and
kneels
and
gives
thanks
that
he
has
such
a
ripping
couple
of
prefects
in
this
house
to
keep
us
all
in
well
you
needn
t
be
sarcastic
about
it
said
manton
yes
i
need
because
you
began
about
having
a
court
of
appeal
to
override
us
you
think
that
it
s
only
you
who
can
be
so
damned
sarcastic
and
superior
and
give
any
garbled
account
you
like
to
the
it
wasn
t
it
must
have
been
or
do
you
suppose
that
a
sensible
chap
like
the
head
could
have
taken
your
side
perhaps
you
didn
t
invent
things
but
i
swear
you
left
out
some
jolly
important
ones
like
your
not
being
able
to
cane
a
cheeky
junior
without
getting
crossley
to
help
you
and
then
whacking
him
on
the
shin
instead
you
should
have
seen
adams
shaking
when
i
told
him
about
it
and
i
bet
you
said
we
set
ourselves
in
opposition
to
you
that
s
a
lie
we
backed
your
authority
up
except
when
you
made
such
utter
squirts
of
yourselves
that
we
couldn
t
we
helped
you
you
goat
we
did
for
you
what
you
couldn
t
do
for
yourselves
lord
it
makes
me
hot
to
talk
to
a
chap
like
you
go
on
mean
brother
manton
was
beginning
to
present
so
ludicrous
an
appearance
that
learned
brother
blaize
could
hardly
prevent
bubbling
with
laughter
which
would
have
spoiled
the
forcibleness
of
the
situation
his
finger
no
longer
kept
his
place
in
his
book
his
tight
little
mouth
no
longer
complacently
smiled
but
had
fallen
open
in
dismay
at
david
s
surprising
remarks
and
learned
brother
crabtree
with
his
suave
style
and
slow
sentences
did
not
reassure
him
you
see
there
s
nothing
like
fair
play
manton
said
bags
i
take
it
that
you
agree
and
as
you
ve
had
an
uninterrupted
innings
with
the
head
and
have
run
up
a
good
score
against
us
i
m
sure
it
is
only
proper
that
we
should
have
our
turn
now
you
were
not
wise
in
refusing
to
tell
us
what
you
had
said
to
the
head
but
the
time
for
that
is
past
now
and
even
if
you
wanted
to
i
don
t
suppose
we
should
listen
to
you
it
was
foolish
of
you
because
you
make
us
guess
what
it
was
and
naturally
we
guess
that
you
made
up
a
lot
of
lies
since
we
think
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
would
do
so
when
you
leave
us
now
which
will
be
very
soon
we
shall
make
up
some
rippers
about
you
and
awful
things
you
know
i
began
making
some
up
when
brother
blaize
was
addressing
you
they
are
gregson
took
up
the
tale
with
a
wink
at
david
in
the
eye
away
from
manton
and
yet
i
don
t
know
that
we
need
bother
to
make
things
up
brother
crabtree
he
said
it
s
easier
to
say
just
a
few
of
the
things
that
really
happened
we
will
tell
the
head
the
sort
of
thing
that
goes
on
in
manton
s
study
when
he
thinks
all
the
house
are
at
now
manton
for
all
his
feebleness
and
ineffectiveness
as
a
prefect
was
as
blameless
as
the
ethiopian
but
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
he
said
gregson
gave
a
little
laugh
which
he
transformed
into
a
cough
oh
really
he
said
but
the
head
will
soon
know
what
we
mean
mean
brother
blaize
david
had
caught
the
wink
correctly
he
put
on
a
scornful
face
oh
he
said
yes
disgusting
you
should
be
more
careful
about
shutting
your
door
manton
i
and
gregson
were
walking
about
the
house
in
slippers
following
the
example
of
the
sixth
but
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
said
manton
right
oh
we
won
t
talk
about
it
any
it
was
in
vain
that
manton
assured
himself
that
as
was
perfectly
true
his
conscience
was
as
clear
as
for
this
wicked
and
fraud
on
the
part
of
those
devils
made
him
uncomfortable
in
spite
of
himself
and
though
he
had
not
told
the
head
anything
false
about
this
beastly
court
of
appeal
he
certainly
had
not
put
their
side
of
the
case
before
him
with
the
directness
that
it
now
appeared
they
were
going
to
do
on
their
own
behalf
he
had
not
for
instance
said
that
the
court
of
appeal
propped
up
endorsed
supported
the
authority
of
himself
and
crossley
far
more
than
they
overrode
it
though
it
was
perfectly
true
as
he
had
told
the
head
that
they
arrogated
the
supreme
authority
to
themselves
nor
had
it
occurred
to
him
to
tell
the
head
that
he
and
crossley
were
quite
incompetent
to
maintain
discipline
that
they
got
ragged
to
the
point
of
having
soap
put
in
their
kettles
that
they
toured
the
house
in
slippers
truly
the
supplement
to
his
tale
was
likely
to
be
as
voluminous
as
the
tale
itself
then
david
rose
well
i
don
t
think
we
need
detain
you
he
said
politely
in
fact
we
ve
got
a
good
deal
to
talk
over
among
ourselves
thanks
awfully
for
coming
i
expect
we
shall
all
meet
again
at
the
head
s
that
s
all
but
manton
was
not
quite
sure
that
this
was
all
various
remarks
by
one
or
other
of
the
members
of
the
court
were
beginning
to
cause
him
somewhat
acute
internal
questionings
in
especial
he
disliked
the
fact
that
adams
was
in
possession
of
the
court
s
side
of
the
case
and
as
like
as
not
would
give
the
head
the
benefit
of
it
perhaps
we
might
discuss
it
all
a
little
more
he
said
with
a
faint
air
of
condescension
still
lingering
about
him
i
go
to
the
head
because
he
told
me
that
if
i
had
anything
more
to
tell
him
i
was
to
i
might
really
should
be
quite
glad
crossley
and
i
didn
t
want
to
get
you
into
oh
that
s
all
right
said
david
cheerfully
don
t
bother
about
that
you
ve
got
us
into
no
trouble
at
all
i
expect
we
shall
come
out
perfectly
but
the
head
was
awfully
sick
about
it
said
manton
he
laid
a
good
deal
of
stress
on
the
fact
that
you
did
set
yourselves
up
as
an
authority
superior
to
the
i
expect
i
ll
make
that
all
square
said
david
i
dare
say
i
shall
put
our
case
as
strongly
as
you
put
yours
adams
will
have
done
the
same
too
i
m
pretty
sure
of
course
we
thought
we
might
let
you
down
more
easily
if
you
told
us
what
you
told
the
head
and
after
all
we
gave
you
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
but
you
didn
t
take
it
so
that
s
well
i
think
perhaps
i
was
wrong
not
to
tell
you
said
manton
i
m
sure
you
were
assented
bags
warmly
isn
t
it
an
awful
pity
one
doesn
t
think
of
that
sort
of
thing
sooner
and
so
if
you
like
i
ll
tell
you
now
said
manton
finishing
his
sentence
oh
we
don
t
care
a
hang
either
way
said
david
if
you
wish
you
may
tell
us
but
it
ll
be
because
you
ask
us
if
you
may
we
don
t
want
to
hear
but
i
thought
you
asked
me
to
said
this
dismal
prefect
we
did
but
it
s
no
use
to
us
now
we
ve
made
up
our
minds
what
to
well
shall
i
tell
the
head
that
you
did
often
support
the
authority
of
the
sixth
it
might
make
him
less
sick
with
rubbish
said
gregson
you
re
proposing
these
things
now
simply
because
you
want
us
not
to
tell
the
head
our
side
of
it
is
that
the
reason
or
not
i
think
it
yes
or
no
said
brother
blaize
in
a
terrible
voice
why
not
have
asked
for
mercy
sooner
then
instead
of
giving
yourself
all
these
airs
get
on
it
was
a
very
unstuffed
manton
who
was
left
at
the
end
of
this
recital
for
though
he
had
not
told
the
head
anything
palpably
false
yet
the
picture
the
head
must
have
drawn
of
the
whole
affair
was
about
as
erroneous
as
it
could
possibly
be
he
had
let
the
head
assume
that
the
authority
of
the
prefects
over
the
house
was
complete
and
satisfactory
until
the
court
of
appeal
set
itself
up
and
he
had
certainly
not
said
that
the
court
in
most
cases
endorsed
their
authority
and
saw
that
their
orders
were
obeyed
all
this
was
drawn
from
him
by
cool
and
ruthless
questioning
at
the
end
david
gave
a
long
whistle
well
pon
my
word
you
are
in
a
mess
he
said
i
m
not
at
all
sure
that
i
shouldn
t
resign
my
prefectship
if
i
were
you
before
the
head
kicked
me
out
you
are
the
deuce
of
a
hand
at
t
that
it
brother
gregson
why
there
isn
t
an
ounce
of
truth
that
you
haven
t
suppressed
and
it
s
all
as
full
of
said
bags
yes
as
it
can
stick
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
and
talk
it
over
with
crossley
and
then
come
back
and
tell
us
what
you
propose
to
tell
the
head
if
you
don
t
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
him
and
let
him
see
that
he
s
only
got
a
i
said
of
it
at
present
you
may
be
sure
we
shall
and
when
you
ve
made
up
your
minds
come
back
and
tell
us
tap
at
the
door
the
unstuffed
manton
rose
yes
i
ll
do
that
he
said
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
david
who
was
growing
extremely
red
in
the
face
with
turned
over
and
buried
his
face
in
the
kicking
wildly
in
the
air
the
other
learned
brethren
stifled
themselves
lest
manton
should
hear
them
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
court
of
appeal
writhed
in
the
agonies
of
silent
mirth
o
lord
said
david
at
length
i
didn
t
know
there
was
such
richness
in
the
world
to
think
that
half
an
hour
ago
that
little
squirt
thought
he
had
us
on
toast
toast
s
there
all
right
but
tisn
t
we
who
are
on
it
and
now
he
s
making
up
another
version
which
is
ours
and
wanting
to
know
if
that
ll
satisfy
us
for
him
to
go
to
the
head
with
o
lord
too
much
mercy
to
let
him
said
bags
not
a
bit
of
it
it
s
much
more
effective
if
manton
puts
our
side
of
it
to
the
but
what
if
he
doesn
t
tell
the
head
all
he
says
he
s
going
to
asked
plugs
he
must
the
only
way
he
can
save
his
face
is
by
going
to
him
at
once
before
adams
can
oh
there
s
toast
enough
besides
when
the
head
sees
us
we
can
soon
tell
if
manton
s
given
him
the
correct
david
as
president
of
the
court
was
summoned
to
the
supreme
presence
next
day
i
ve
been
into
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeal
said
the
head
and
what
manton
told
me
last
night
puts
a
different
complexion
on
it
from
what
i
had
heard
before
of
course
the
court
must
be
dissolved
at
once
blaize
you
understand
that
yes
a
faint
smile
spread
over
the
head
s
face
as
he
looked
at
the
big
jolly
boy
and
tell
learned
brethren
he
said
what
i
say
the
authorities
in
your
house
are
adams
and
the
prefects
and
there
are
no
other
authorities
but
i
believe
now
that
on
the
whole
the
court
meant
well
and
i
am
quite
certain
it
enjoyed
itself
immensely
that
particular
enjoyment
i
am
afraid
must
cease
but
i
want
court
that
continue
meaning
well
in
a
private
capacity
and
to
support
the
prefects
authority
though
it
may
no
longer
enforce
or
reverse
their
orders
and
blaize
this
is
for
your
private
ear
alone
i
think
the
court
probably
did
very
useful
work
but
we
mustn
t
have
any
more
courts
that
s
all
then
how
are
you
getting
on
well
i
hope
and
adams
seems
to
think
so
heard
anything
from
your
friend
maddox
lately
gosh
what
a
brick
said
david
to
himself
as
he
went
out
chapter
xv
david
was
lying
on
his
back
under
the
big
near
the
cricket
pavilion
one
sunday
afternoon
in
by
him
upright
and
attentive
sat
the
faithful
bags
listening
and
occasionally
playing
the
part
of
greek
chorus
that
is
to
say
putting
in
short
appropriate
reflections
to
a
quantity
of
surprising
information
both
boys
wore
the
white
tie
characteristic
of
prefects
on
sunday
for
both
had
got
their
promotion
into
the
lower
sixth
at
easter
and
were
colleagues
of
the
inefficient
manton
and
crossley
those
two
young
gentlemen
it
may
be
remarked
were
vastly
relieved
to
have
the
burden
of
authority
taken
off
their
somewhat
feeble
shoulders
and
david
and
bags
particularly
david
ruled
the
house
with
genial
exuberance
and
when
necessary
a
rod
of
iron
just
now
both
the
iron
and
the
exuberance
were
relaxed
and
david
lay
there
in
an
abandonment
of
physical
laziness
his
straw
hat
with
cricket
eleven
colours
was
tilted
over
the
top
part
of
his
face
so
as
to
shield
his
eyes
from
the
speckles
and
sparkles
of
sun
that
filtered
through
the
canopy
of
leaves
above
him
and
his
mouth
and
chin
alone
were
visible
his
long
legs
were
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
showing
a
white
hiatus
between
a
despondent
sock
and
the
end
of
his
trousers
and
a
persistent
fly
kept
settling
there
an
attention
which
he
acknowledged
by
dabbing
at
it
with
the
other
ankle
tisn
t
as
if
i
was
a
little
boy
any
longer
he
said
when
a
fellow
is
close
on
seventeen
as
you
and
i
are
it
s
time
he
began
to
realise
that
he
s
grown
up
why
my
mother
was
only
seventeen
when
she
but
do
you
propose
to
marry
at
seventeen
asked
bags
with
sarcastic
allusion
to
the
conversation
that
had
gone
before
where
ll
she
live
she
can
t
very
well
sleep
in
david
gave
a
little
spurt
of
laughter
and
the
sun
shone
on
his
white
teeth
and
down
his
red
throat
but
he
quickly
became
grave
again
is
that
funny
he
said
if
so
i
suppose
i
d
better
laugh
though
i
wish
i
saw
the
point
who
said
i
was
going
to
marry
o
gosh
what
a
clipper
she
is
and
it
s
not
much
more
than
a
fortnight
ago
that
you
thought
all
girls
were
rotten
said
bags
more
fool
me
then
and
more
fool
you
for
still
thinking
so
lord
i
wish
i
was
really
grown
up
quite
old
i
mean
nineteen
or
twenty
i
say
do
you
think
she
looked
at
me
at
all
in
chapel
this
morning
i
don
t
think
so
said
bags
cheerily
and
i
was
watching
her
pretty
nearly
all
the
time
as
i
knew
you
would
ask
oh
yes
she
did
once
when
you
began
to
sing
amen
before
it
was
time
but
she
looked
away
again
at
ha
ha
said
david
in
a
dry
speaking
voice
not
laughing
at
all
well
she
s
bound
to
come
to
the
old
boys
match
isn
t
she
and
i
don
t
see
how
she
can
help
noticing
if
i
take
any
nor
if
you
get
constantly
hit
out
of
the
ground
said
bags
david
found
he
agreed
with
this
you
re
a
jolly
sympathetic
sort
of
pal
he
said
at
length
bags
had
a
certain
defence
well
it
seems
so
queer
of
you
he
said
it
s
rot
if
you
re
going
to
think
about
and
talk
about
nothing
else
than
a
female
girl
besides
she
must
be
frightfully
old
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
she
was
twenty
why
your
mother
had
been
married
three
years
when
she
was
as
old
as
yes
and
had
had
two
children
and
had
also
died
said
david
rather
embarrassingly
oh
sorry
i
didn
t
know
said
bags
but
about
your
girl
now
he
went
on
hurriedly
how
do
you
know
she
isn
t
engaged
already
she
easily
might
be
she
s
awfully
pretty
i
grant
you
that
at
least
i
suppose
she
is
though
both
you
and
i
used
to
think
that
all
girls
looked
exactly
idiots
idiots
we
were
said
david
kicking
wildly
in
the
air
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
continued
bags
who
always
saw
the
practical
issues
are
you
going
to
tell
her
how
frightfully
keen
you
are
on
her
i
expect
she
guesses
said
david
solemnly
she
came
to
tea
with
me
twice
in
my
study
and
it
s
rather
marked
for
a
fellow
to
ask
a
don
s
daughter
to
tea
twice
in
the
same
half
specially
if
she
comes
the
first
well
but
you
didn
t
say
anything
sweet
and
moonlightly
to
her
said
bags
you
talked
about
nothing
but
cricket
besides
plugs
and
i
were
there
the
whole
time
and
so
was
mother
david
drew
a
long
breath
and
stretched
his
arms
and
legs
out
in
the
form
of
one
crucified
till
elbows
and
knees
were
taut
violet
gray
he
said
dwelling
on
the
syllables
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
jolly
name
and
it
s
just
like
her
it
s
a
slim
bags
groaned
slightly
it
really
was
appalling
for
david
to
be
in
this
deplorable
state
violet
gray
he
said
in
a
manner
h
m
violet
gray
i
think
it
sounds
better
than
violet
david
sat
up
bags
you
don
t
understand
one
single
thing
about
it
he
said
how
can
i
explain
she
s
just
the
most
wonderful
and
beautiful
thing
that
ever
happened
i
wonder
if
frank
will
understand
i
shall
tell
him
but
nobody
else
he
s
coming
down
end
of
next
he
ll
probably
cut
you
out
said
bags
who
thought
a
bracing
treatment
was
best
for
his
idiotic
friend
not
he
we
re
pals
of
course
he
could
if
he
wanted
since
any
girl
would
fall
in
love
with
frank
straight
off
if
he
held
up
his
little
finger
jove
i
d
give
anything
to
see
the
varsity
this
week
and
to
think
that
in
final
last
year
i
was
in
at
one
end
and
a
cambridge
cricket
blue
the
well
that
happened
to
everybody
else
in
the
said
bags
since
maddox
went
in
first
and
carried
his
bat
david
laughed
so
it
did
he
said
i
ll
back
you
against
any
one
in
the
world
bags
for
bald
literal
prosaicness
you
haven
t
got
an
ounce
of
imagination
you
see
things
just
exactly
as
they
happen
you
ve
less
of
romance
a
he
said
looking
round
for
inspiration
and
seeing
that
useful
article
with
its
shafts
in
the
air
perhaps
i
have
perhaps
i
haven
t
said
bags
but
it
s
perfectly
true
i
don
t
jaw
about
it
never
mind
that
look
here
supposing
you
might
either
kiss
violet
gray
twice
we
ll
say
or
see
the
oxford
and
cambridge
match
which
would
you
choose
depends
on
the
match
said
david
of
course
if
frank
was
going
to
make
a
century
and
i
were
to
see
him
do
that
i
don
t
know
what
else
i
could
choose
o
lord
but
fancy
kissing
her
though
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
ask
such
stumpers
but
that
s
you
all
over
you
want
me
to
be
practical
and
say
which
i
should
like
best
but
i
just
can
t
feel
like
a
dog
which
is
being
whistled
to
from
opposite
directions
by
two
fellows
it
loves
doesn
t
know
which
way
to
bags
sniffed
scornfully
oh
you
ve
not
got
it
so
desperately
if
you
only
feel
like
that
he
said
david
shut
his
eyes
and
made
his
mouth
tight
with
an
air
of
determination
i
should
choose
kissing
her
he
said
because
frank
could
tell
me
all
about
the
match
afterwards
and
besides
it
would
all
be
reported
in
the
and
i
could
read
about
it
but
i
couldn
t
read
about
my
kissing
her
in
the
paper
at
least
i
don
t
know
in
which
oh
lord
but
fancy
missing
seeing
frank
putting
perfectly
straight
balls
away
to
the
leg
boundary
in
the
varsity
match
and
then
scratching
his
ear
as
he
always
does
when
he
hits
a
boundary
as
if
wondering
what
on
earth
has
happened
to
the
ball
i
don
t
know
which
i
should
choose
i
don
t
david
looked
mournfully
round
for
inspiration
and
lay
down
again
after
all
i
wonder
whether
it
s
worth
while
doing
anything
or
getting
anything
he
said
with
a
sudden
lugubrious
accent
i
tried
to
think
it
would
be
a
damned
fine
thing
to
get
into
the
sixth
and
yet
before
a
month
was
out
we
both
got
absolutely
accustomed
to
it
it
s
been
just
the
same
about
getting
into
well
not
quite
because
i
do
enjoy
that
most
awfully
still
but
i
dare
say
it
won
t
last
why
a
year
ago
if
i
had
been
told
that
i
might
have
any
two
things
i
wanted
i
should
have
chosen
to
get
into
the
sixth
and
the
eleven
it
didn
t
seem
that
there
was
anything
more
to
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
chosen
that
maddox
shouldn
t
leave
remarked
bags
no
use
wishing
that
he
had
to
besides
if
he
hadn
t
he
wouldn
t
be
in
the
cambridge
eleven
now
and
you
can
t
choose
anything
that
clips
your
pal
s
wings
tisn
t
my
expression
adams
said
it
the
other
day
when
he
was
talking
to
me
about
didn
t
know
jevons
had
any
wings
said
bags
nor
did
i
but
adams
seems
to
think
so
i
say
adams
is
rather
a
wise
sort
of
man
and
he
sees
just
about
three
times
as
much
as
i
thought
oh
and
he
told
me
hughes
had
passed
into
sandhurst
he
must
have
become
a
decent
chap
they
do
said
bags
jolly
glad
about
adams
i
always
imagined
that
as
long
as
he
wasn
t
bothered
he
didn
t
mind
much
what
happened
short
of
a
public
row
but
i
believe
his
funny
old
eye
is
on
us
more
than
we
and
much
more
than
it
used
to
be
said
bags
you
know
the
bizz
about
the
court
of
appeal
woke
him
up
tremendous
there
was
a
regular
and
going
on
in
the
house
under
his
very
nose
and
he
had
never
suspected
it
up
till
then
he
didn
t
bother
about
what
any
one
did
as
long
as
there
wasn
t
a
row
you
know
david
the
house
was
a
perfect
hell
about
the
time
you
and
i
came
here
and
adams
hadn
t
a
notion
of
david
sat
up
quickly
i
dare
say
he
said
but
frank
kept
all
that
away
from
me
anyhow
the
house
is
pretty
well
all
right
now
there
is
nothing
to
make
a
row
no
smoking
no
cribbing
no
filth
it
s
ever
so
much
more
cheery
to
be
like
that
and
just
think
that
less
than
three
years
ago
bags
you
and
i
were
just
beginning
as
two
dirty
little
fags
what
a
bag
of
tricks
has
happened
since
then
what
were
we
talking
about
oh
jevons
adams
was
awfully
decent
to
me
about
it
made
me
blush
he
said
i
d
taught
jev
to
be
s
true
when
he
first
used
to
fag
for
frank
i
wanted
to
wash
the
again
when
his
filthy
little
paws
had
touched
oh
yes
he
said
i
d
cured
him
of
swearing
which
perhaps
was
true
also
though
it
seemed
rather
bad
luck
on
him
to
be
whacked
by
me
for
swearing
when
as
adams
said
he
d
picked
it
up
from
me
so
i
had
to
cure
myself
as
well
which
i
ve
almost
done
but
then
i
couldn
t
whack
myself
when
i
swore
so
jev
got
on
quicker
than
i
you
re
not
getting
on
much
now
remarked
bags
patiently
listening
yes
i
am
shut
up
i
m
just
coming
to
the
wings
adams
said
i
was
fussing
over
him
too
much
and
tying
a
string
to
his
leg
and
clipping
his
wings
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
fly
about
as
he
damn
pleased
lord
jev
would
have
got
whacked
for
that
but
you
see
he
s
turning
out
rather
a
fetching
you
know
and
all
that
and
i
m
not
going
to
have
him
taken
up
by
some
brute
and
spoiled
however
any
one
who
tries
will
have
a
nasty
time
with
me
first
but
i
suppose
adams
is
right
jev
s
got
to
begin
looking
after
himself
i
m
rather
sorry
in
a
way
though
it
s
good
sport
looking
after
a
kid
like
that
and
seeing
it
doesn
t
come
to
any
harm
he
s
an
affectionate
little
beggar
too
and
i
believe
he
knows
it
would
make
me
pretty
sick
if
he
got
into
beastly
ways
i
say
i
m
afraid
i
m
talking
like
a
on
the
plains
of
timbuctoo
remarked
bags
yes
anywhere
rum
fellow
you
are
bags
you
let
me
jaw
to
any
extent
without
yawning
or
telling
me
to
shut
it
but
there
are
such
a
lot
of
frightfully
interesting
things
that
you
must
talk
about
in
order
to
find
out
what
you
really
think
jev
for
instance
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
a
missionary
till
i
began
to
jaw
by
the
way
my
father
is
coming
down
for
the
old
boys
match
next
week
d
you
remember
that
awful
morning
when
he
bowled
into
the
wrong
net
at
helmsworth
and
how
ashamed
i
was
funny
how
one
changes
i
should
just
love
it
if
he
did
it
again
now
because
it
s
so
jolly
sporting
of
him
to
try
to
bowl
at
all
my
sister
s
coming
too
and
of
course
frank
will
be
here
playing
for
the
old
boys
what
a
family
they
all
love
frank
at
home
he
and
my
father
are
tremendous
pals
they
talk
about
norman
and
perpendicular
and
transitional
till
all
s
blue
he
stayed
with
us
most
of
the
christmas
holidays
you
know
when
his
mother
was
david
sat
up
again
lord
what
a
lot
of
things
there
are
he
said
appreciatively
not
to
mention
her
said
bags
no
oh
by
the
way
i
saw
her
coming
out
of
madden
s
the
photographer
s
the
other
day
do
you
suppose
she
d
been
done
by
jove
shouldn
t
i
like
one
well
ask
her
then
said
bags
with
infinite
patience
david
knitted
his
forehead
into
a
diplomatic
frown
i
couldn
t
straight
off
like
that
he
said
but
i
might
lead
up
to
it
i
might
say
i
thought
madden
took
jolly
good
photographs
and
see
what
she
suppose
she
said
that
she
thought
he
didn
t
said
bags
wearily
well
i
could
say
no
one
could
do
justice
to
some
people
or
is
that
laying
it
on
rather
thick
oh
by
the
way
i
ve
been
devilish
cunning
the
head
told
me
that
my
last
iambics
were
pretty
rotten
and
that
i
d
better
have
some
private
tuition
so
i
asked
if
i
might
go
to
old
gray
for
it
jolly
smart
that
so
i
m
going
to
drop
french
and
have
private
tu
with
gray
beginning
come
into
the
garden
maud
remarked
bags
what
s
maud
i
see
you
mean
violet
yes
that
s
the
idea
going
in
and
out
of
the
house
i
m
sure
to
run
across
her
see
why
it
s
striking
four
let
s
go
down
to
david
as
is
the
way
of
boys
rising
seventeen
had
been
growing
tremendously
these
last
six
months
not
in
physical
ways
only
but
in
stature
of
the
mind
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a
boy
less
of
a
prig
than
he
or
one
so
unweighted
with
the
sense
of
duty
or
responsibility
but
with
his
growth
he
had
taken
up
his
responsibilities
quite
simply
and
unconsciously
and
eagerly
without
having
any
egoism
about
it
he
did
not
in
fact
do
these
things
and
behave
in
a
manner
that
made
him
so
breezy
a
treasure
to
his
because
he
heavily
realised
that
there
were
things
he
ought
to
do
and
a
manner
in
which
he
ought
to
behave
but
because
he
obeyed
unconsciously
the
bent
of
his
natural
instincts
which
were
those
of
a
very
and
excellent
fellow
now
budding
from
boyhood
into
early
manhood
he
had
no
private
meditations
at
all
on
the
subject
but
merely
lived
in
active
and
wholesome
ways
and
enjoyed
himself
immensely
and
if
by
any
chance
he
had
come
to
learn
what
adams
really
thought
of
him
he
would
have
had
no
doubt
that
his
informant
was
just
pulling
his
his
genial
unconsciousness
that
he
had
any
influence
at
all
was
exactly
that
which
made
his
influence
so
strong
he
had
the
admirable
gift
of
not
thinking
about
himself
but
purely
about
the
large
quantity
of
attractive
affairs
that
made
up
life
and
the
number
of
jolly
chaps
with
whom
he
was
associated
he
had
even
been
known
to
admit
that
manton
and
crossley
to
counteract
whose
ridiculous
ineffectiveness
the
court
of
appeal
had
been
founded
were
decent
enough
though
of
course
no
earthly
good
as
prefects
in
the
same
way
it
was
from
no
sense
of
conscious
duty
that
he
had
educated
and
still
watched
over
jevons
it
was
sport
looking
after
a
kid
was
exactly
the
true
account
of
the
trouble
he
had
taken
then
part
of
his
growth
had
come
this
violent
adoration
of
violet
gray
as
natural
as
the
strutting
of
the
young
male
bird
when
first
it
is
conscious
of
another
sex
than
his
david
had
suddenly
perceived
that
though
in
many
things
girls
are
rotters
there
was
something
about
them
that
made
it
necessary
to
wear
buttonholes
and
if
possible
make
runs
or
take
wickets
for
other
reasons
than
those
generally
necessary
the
two
boys
strolled
at
sunday
pace
down
over
the
hot
sunny
field
which
wore
its
air
of
sabbatical
and
empty
leisure
may
had
been
a
wet
month
and
the
grass
still
retained
the
varnished
freshness
of
spring
except
where
in
patches
it
had
been
worn
by
pitches
or
but
for
the
last
fortnight
no
rain
had
fallen
and
the
light
soil
quick
to
dry
was
beginning
to
get
hard
and
give
bowlers
such
as
david
the
crumbling
wickets
in
which
his
soul
delighted
adams
s
house
had
scraped
through
the
first
ties
of
for
though
david
on
whom
they
relied
to
thwart
and
discomfit
their
opponents
had
proved
on
that
occasion
to
be
extremely
expensive
and
quite
useless
as
a
bowler
he
had
in
some
weird
fashion
of
his
own
managed
to
make
fifty
of
the
most
awful
runs
ever
scored
chiefly
by
amazing
over
the
heads
of
point
and
slips
he
had
also
been
badly
missed
off
the
first
ball
he
received
which
added
humour
to
the
performance
and
a
little
later
his
had
been
smartly
hit
though
without
displacing
the
bails
he
had
hailed
this
with
a
shriek
of
laughter
but
in
the
second
tie
played
last
week
he
had
shown
himself
in
truer
colours
and
had
been
bowled
fair
and
square
in
both
innings
without
scoring
at
all
but
had
done
things
with
the
ball
that
really
seemed
inspired
by
satan
he
had
grown
into
a
bowler
of
the
googliest
type
and
had
discovered
all
for
himself
that
if
he
let
his
wave
in
the
air
instead
of
rolling
it
tight
up
round
his
elbow
it
presented
a
much
more
puzzling
outline
to
the
batsman
on
that
day
there
had
been
too
a
high
and
all
that
most
of
the
batsmen
who
were
favoured
with
his
deliveries
knew
was
that
from
very
far
off
an
immense
lanky
figure
came
prancing
in
a
curved
run
up
to
the
wickets
and
that
from
somewhere
at
the
end
of
clothes
hung
up
to
dry
a
quavering
object
that
was
supposed
to
be
a
skidded
through
the
air
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
really
impossible
to
tell
what
it
was
doing
or
what
it
would
do
sometimes
when
it
looked
most
charged
with
incalculable
waywardness
it
did
nothing
but
bounce
as
an
innocent
and
rotund
ball
should
at
other
times
chiefly
when
it
looked
almost
pathetically
guileless
it
played
the
lowest
tricks
that
the
laws
of
spin
permitted
it
kicked
out
like
a
horse
when
it
pitched
or
it
leaped
nervously
aside
as
if
trying
to
avoid
the
bat
in
fact
the
odds
were
that
it
did
precisely
what
you
didn
t
expect
or
again
the
demoniac
blazes
would
run
up
to
the
wickets
with
less
than
his
usual
prance
but
in
a
slow
and
thoughtful
manner
as
if
he
had
a
headache
but
if
the
wary
batsman
imagined
as
he
not
unfrequently
did
that
this
was
the
prelude
to
a
slow
and
thoughtful
ball
he
occasionally
though
not
always
found
he
was
quite
in
error
an
extremely
fast
and
straight
ball
was
all
that
the
thoughtful
manner
meant
whereby
we
learn
the
danger
of
trusting
to
appearances
and
what
made
all
these
antics
the
more
flustering
and
annoying
was
that
david
with
guileless
sincerity
frankly
confessed
that
he
was
often
by
no
means
clear
himself
what
the
ball
was
going
to
do
i
always
mean
it
to
do
something
rum
he
said
but
of
course
it
doesn
t
always
come
off
and
sometimes
it
does
just
the
opposite
that
s
such
awful
fun
it
s
all
silly
tosh
my
bowling
you
know
comes
off
in
sometimes
but
any
school
team
would
hit
me
over
the
this
perfectly
sincere
view
of
his
own
performance
was
not
shared
by
humphreys
the
captain
of
the
school
eleven
who
had
twice
been
one
of
david
s
victims
and
to
whom
this
opinion
was
expressed
but
the
one
you
bowled
me
with
in
the
first
innings
said
that
young
man
came
round
my
legs
and
took
the
blast
you
didn
t
you
mean
that
david
put
his
head
on
one
side
considering
yes
i
think
i
did
he
said
it
was
rather
a
good
ball
for
me
i
thought
it
might
do
something
of
the
sort
every
one
gets
a
good
ball
in
sometimes
if
they
go
on
long
well
i
wish
you
would
keep
them
for
said
humphreys
and
second
innings
you
had
me
with
a
roaring
miles
an
hour
i
thought
it
was
only
and
so
i
missed
it
by
ten
david
laughed
sorry
it
was
rather
a
fast
one
he
said
i
thought
it
had
got
you
in
the
tummy
jolly
glad
it
was
only
your
so
m
i
remarked
humphreys
come
and
since
then
every
day
had
added
to
the
pace
of
the
ground
and
this
sunday
afternoon
as
david
strolled
down
with
bags
he
looked
at
the
turf
with
extreme
content
just
my
luck
all
over
he
said
that
it
should
be
getting
into
the
state
that
suits
me
best
for
old
boys
match
lord
what
a
pity
i
said
that
i
shan
t
be
able
to
send
down
a
decent
ball
now
but
i
should
love
to
bowl
frank
bags
i
do
think
about
cricket
so
tremendously
in
the
summer
half
i
lie
awake
making
he
took
a
short
run
and
brought
his
arm
over
his
shoulder
in
a
complicated
fashion
why
shouldn
t
i
bring
my
arm
up
overhand
like
that
he
said
and
turn
my
wrist
over
underhand
you
might
say
that
the
ball
would
simply
fly
up
gently
in
the
air
and
fall
at
my
feet
but
something
might
be
done
with
it
you
can
usually
do
something
with
anything
if
you
give
your
mind
to
like
you
with
jev
remarked
bags
oh
that
s
only
adams
s
he
broke
off
and
focused
his
blue
eyes
on
a
group
of
figures
coming
up
the
field
towards
them
lord
here
s
mother
gray
and
violet
coming
he
said
i
say
is
my
tie
straight
who
s
the
man
with
them
don
t
know
friend
of
theirs
clever
fellow
hope
they
ll
ask
me
to
david
had
been
carrying
his
straw
hat
in
his
hand
but
put
it
on
in
order
to
have
the
joy
of
taking
it
off
to
them
same
man
who
was
in
chapel
this
morning
with
them
said
bags
in
an
undertone
was
he
didn
t
see
him
lord
doesn
t
she
look
ripping
there
is
always
some
slight
discomfort
attached
to
a
meeting
which
is
seen
while
yet
a
long
way
off
to
be
coming
a
difficulty
in
knowing
the
right
moment
to
cease
being
absorbed
in
the
landscape
or
in
intelligent
conversation
with
your
friend
and
to
become
conscious
of
it
in
proper
time
to
apply
a
suitable
smile
of
recognition
to
the
face
david
with
his
tingling
heart
managed
it
with
wonderful
he
put
on
a
brilliant
smile
long
before
it
could
be
seen
at
all
and
feeling
as
if
his
cheeks
would
crack
took
it
completely
off
again
then
he
tried
to
talk
to
bags
in
a
natural
manner
and
pointed
to
nothing
at
all
away
to
the
right
then
he
proceeded
to
talk
to
bags
again
much
too
long
and
did
not
look
up
till
the
adorable
one
was
but
a
couple
of
yards
off
on
came
the
smile
of
recognition
again
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
dropped
it
and
alas
for
the
hope
of
being
asked
to
tea
when
he
picked
up
his
hat
again
the
vision
had
already
gone
by
and
it
was
only
the
most
instantaneous
return
of
his
smile
that
he
reaped
from
all
those
muddled
man≈ìuvres
so
on
they
went
bags
with
face
red
from
suppressed
giggles
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
ass
asked
david
in
an
indignant
whisper
i
don
t
see
anything
no
you
wouldn
t
you
were
the
funny
what
did
i
do
demanded
david
first
you
grinned
an
awful
grin
miles
too
soon
said
bags
then
you
looked
as
grave
as
a
judge
with
indigestion
then
miles
too
late
you
gave
another
awful
grin
and
dropped
your
hat
sorry
you
didn
t
get
your
tea
but
it
was
too
funny
for
david
was
radically
incapable
of
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
at
a
time
and
grinned
in
a
less
awful
manner
i
never
felt
such
a
silly
fool
he
said
and
i
m
not
sure
i
like
that
man
what
do
you
suppose
they
were
talking
about
so
interestedly
can
t
say
run
back
and
ask
them
said
bags
i
thought
he
looked
rather
a
decent
chap
awfully
too
a
bit
like
david
gave
a
snort
of
disdain
like
your
grandmother
he
observed
in
a
withering
manner
which
one
i
ve
got
david
took
hold
of
bags
by
the
shoulders
and
ran
him
down
the
bit
of
steep
hill
to
the
gate
the
ugliest
he
said
and
the
fattest
and
the
beastliest
i
say
though
it
was
rather
a
sell
for
complete
suck
said
bags
there
are
exactly
as
many
ways
of
falling
in
love
as
there
are
different
natures
in
the
world
and
since
every
one
boy
or
man
or
girl
or
woman
falls
in
love
off
the
same
carpet
so
to
speak
on
which
he
transacts
the
other
affairs
of
life
it
followed
that
david
s
first
excursion
into
the
enchanted
country
was
made
with
enthusiasm
and
gaiety
and
innocence
and
with
that
forgetfulness
of
himself
that
characterised
his
other
ways
and
works
that
he
was
in
love
at
all
any
man
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
forget
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
boy
would
probably
have
denied
calling
his
feelings
at
the
most
but
no
boy
unless
he
was
a
shrivelled
old
man
could
doubt
for
a
moment
the
genuineness
of
david
s
emotion
it
seriously
threatened
for
the
next
few
weeks
to
dethrone
the
dominant
passion
inspired
by
cricket
and
since
that
absolutely
refused
to
vacate
the
supreme
throne
love
squeezed
itself
in
and
sat
beside
it
so
that
if
david
lay
awake
on
sunday
pondering
over
fresh
wiles
in
the
matter
of
his
googlies
on
monday
the
googlies
would
not
enter
his
head
at
all
except
as
shadows
and
he
would
devote
the
whole
of
his
insomnia
which
perhaps
lasted
half
an
hour
to
the
contemplation
of
the
adorable
violet
at
such
times
he
would
give
vent
to
a
sound
between
a
sigh
and
a
groan
and
jevons
from
the
next
bed
would
ask
if
he
had
then
david
would
say
savagely
no
you
little
ass
go
to
sleep
and
add
in
a
minute
or
two
thanks
for
asking
at
this
high
level
his
adoration
remained
for
a
whole
month
occasionally
as
during
the
two
days
of
the
old
boys
match
he
would
be
more
absorbed
in
cricket
while
violet
looked
on
from
the
throne
of
his
heart
even
as
she
looked
on
from
the
balcony
of
the
pavilion
but
on
the
day
succeeding
the
glorious
discomfiture
of
the
old
boys
cricket
as
an
active
principle
in
his
mind
lapsed
into
a
state
of
quiescence
while
violet
became
volcanic
again
he
did
not
want
anything
from
her
though
the
thought
of
kissing
her
a
wild
flight
of
impossible
fancy
sent
his
heart
into
his
mouth
he
only
wanted
that
she
should
be
she
and
he
an
adorer
he
could
have
given
no
further
account
of
it
than
that
all
his
other
friends
frank
and
his
own
sister
and
bags
and
plugs
were
on
a
different
plane
he
loved
margery
he
loved
frank
he
esteemed
and
relied
on
bags
but
none
gave
him
any
tremor
any
sense
of
excitement
but
for
violet
his
boyish
heart
was
full
of
a
sweet
tumult
and
confusion
whenever
the
enchantress
came
within
eyeshot
meantime
the
strange
young
man
who
had
roused
david
s
suspicions
on
sunday
afternoon
continued
staying
with
the
grays
but
his
presence
was
accounted
for
since
to
david
s
great
relief
he
proved
to
be
a
cousin
he
proved
also
which
was
satisfactory
to
be
a
man
who
played
cricket
occasionally
for
his
county
and
thus
had
a
claim
to
respect
and
took
part
in
a
match
against
the
masters
playing
for
them
on
that
occasion
he
proceeded
to
hit
david
s
bowling
to
all
parts
of
the
compass
with
the
utmost
ease
and
enjoyment
a
feat
that
raised
him
in
the
bowler
s
estimation
eventually
david
got
him
out
with
a
ball
about
which
leonard
gray
knew
absolutely
nothing
but
he
had
been
treated
with
wonderful
contempt
first
and
as
gray
retired
he
nodded
in
a
friendly
manner
glad
you
didn
t
send
that
ball
down
sooner
blaize
he
said
then
with
the
suddenness
of
a
thunderbolt
the
end
came
bags
brought
the
fateful
news
while
david
was
ecstatically
employed
on
a
model
which
frank
had
given
him
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
ripping
he
shouted
frank
sent
it
me
this
morning
it
flew
the
whole
length
of
hall
just
now
wait
till
i
wind
it
up
david
picked
up
the
beloved
machine
and
began
winding
it
what
s
up
he
said
looking
at
bags
anything
beastly
happened
nothing
wrong
in
the
house
is
there
oh
david
i
m
so
sorry
said
bags
david
let
go
of
the
winder
and
the
propeller
whirred
and
pulled
as
the
wheels
ran
round
well
get
on
he
said
she
s
engaged
to
that
cousin
said
bags
banns
were
given
out
yesterday
at
the
parish
church
plugs
told
me
his
people
were
down
and
he
went
with
them
to
church
instead
of
david
felt
the
world
topple
round
him
he
sat
down
and
turned
very
red
in
the
face
oh
was
all
he
said
then
bags
came
a
step
closer
i
say
david
he
said
shyly
if
you
only
knew
how
i
hate
anything
that
hurts
you
i
should
like
to
kill
that
and
his
plain
rather
face
glowed
with
that
which
had
so
long
inspired
him
namely
his
affection
for
david
that
shy
silent
passion
of
friendship
david
spun
the
propeller
once
or
twice
well
he
s
a
jolly
lucky
chap
he
said
at
length
then
he
looked
at
bags
and
saw
in
his
eyes
just
that
blind
devotion
that
you
can
see
in
a
dog
s
eyes
if
you
understand
dogs
he
got
up
and
put
a
hand
on
bags
s
shoulder
it
s
ripping
of
you
to
care
bags
he
said
i
m
no
end
grateful
hell
later
in
the
year
it
may
be
remembered
the
legislated
on
this
subject
chapter
xvi
the
school
was
assembled
at
evening
chapel
on
the
last
sunday
of
this
summer
term
would
be
with
all
its
attendant
festivities
down
to
concert
in
the
evening
and
another
adams
s
in
celebration
of
their
again
having
won
the
house
on
tuesday
the
school
would
break
up
to
meet
again
in
large
numbers
on
friday
for
the
match
at
lord
s
just
now
the
hymn
after
the
third
collect
had
been
sung
but
after
that
instead
of
the
chaplain
continuing
to
read
the
prayers
the
head
did
so
next
him
in
his
pew
was
frank
and
before
the
prayer
for
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
there
was
a
short
pause
and
the
silence
became
tense
for
every
one
present
guessed
what
was
coming
then
the
quiet
slow
voice
began
again
your
prayers
are
requested
for
your
friend
david
blaize
it
said
who
is
lying
dangerously
then
the
three
remaining
prayers
were
said
but
before
the
final
hymn
was
given
out
there
came
another
pause
and
the
head
rose
he
spoke
more
intimately
now
you
will
all
want
to
know
what
news
i
have
to
give
you
he
said
so
before
we
finish
the
service
i
will
tell
you
i
saw
david
blaize
just
before
chapel
he
was
quite
conscious
and
not
frightened
at
all
he
knew
quite
well
for
his
father
had
told
him
that
he
was
in
extreme
danger
i
only
saw
him
for
a
minute
but
i
said
we
were
going
to
pray
for
him
this
evening
as
we
have
done
perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
what
he
said
to
the
head
paused
a
moment
began
once
and
then
mastered
his
voice
better
he
said
thanks
awfully
sir
that
ll
do
me
a
little
rustle
and
stir
went
round
chapel
and
all
that
any
one
had
known
of
david
came
and
stood
quite
close
to
him
bags
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
seat
of
the
sixth
form
leaned
forward
putting
his
head
on
his
hands
frank
who
had
come
down
an
hour
before
just
looked
at
the
head
waiting
then
the
head
spoke
again
i
have
told
you
this
on
purpose
he
said
to
show
you
how
he
faces
death
if
it
is
that
god
wishes
him
to
face
also
to
show
you
that
as
he
still
hopes
to
live
we
must
hope
it
with
him
in
all
the
power
that
prayer
gives
us
but
he
faces
death
with
all
gay
courage
with
which
he
faced
that
which
has
brought
him
into
peril
of
it
there
are
many
of
you
who
loved
him
and
i
am
among
them
and
we
must
be
level
with
him
in
our
courage
now
we
will
sing
the
hymn
lead
us
heavenly
father
lead
the
whole
school
of
course
knew
what
had
happened
two
days
before
a
young
horse
harnessed
to
a
light
cart
and
frightened
by
a
had
bolted
straight
down
the
steep
high
street
at
marchester
full
at
its
lower
end
with
the
crowded
traffic
of
and
the
driver
had
been
pitched
off
the
box
so
that
it
galloped
on
unchecked
and
mad
with
fright
at
the
moment
david
with
a
bag
of
macaroons
which
he
had
just
bought
came
out
of
throwing
the
parcel
to
bags
who
was
with
him
he
had
shouted
out
catch
hold
and
don
t
eat
any
and
had
rushed
straight
out
into
the
road
taking
a
header
so
to
speak
at
the
horse
he
had
got
hold
of
a
rein
and
then
still
holding
it
had
been
jerked
off
his
feet
and
the
wheel
of
the
cart
had
gone
over
him
but
the
horse
was
checked
and
when
they
picked
the
boy
up
they
found
that
the
rein
was
still
wrapped
round
his
wrist
there
were
severe
internal
injuries
not
necessarily
fatal
but
until
several
days
had
elapsed
every
minute
was
critical
with
danger
up
till
this
morning
all
had
gone
well
but
a
few
hours
ago
there
had
been
disquieting
symptoms
with
fever
and
restlessness
and
signs
of
exhaustion
he
had
been
conscious
all
day
and
was
no
longer
in
great
pain
but
it
was
feared
that
nervous
shock
consequent
on
internal
injury
might
overcome
the
splendid
powers
of
rallying
which
he
had
shown
at
first
his
father
and
margery
had
come
down
the
day
before
but
they
had
scarcely
seen
him
since
the
utmost
quiet
was
necessary
and
an
hour
ago
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
in
great
danger
it
was
to
this
that
the
head
had
referred
adams
s
house
was
nearer
to
where
the
accident
happened
than
the
school
sanatorium
and
he
had
been
moved
there
since
every
extra
yard
was
extra
danger
and
for
two
days
now
a
strange
silence
as
of
life
in
a
dream
had
lain
over
it
there
had
been
no
need
for
adams
to
tell
them
not
to
make
any
noise
or
disturbance
for
the
boys
crept
about
like
mice
and
no
voice
was
raised
it
seemed
impossible
that
this
should
have
happened
to
anybody
most
of
all
that
it
should
have
happened
to
david
and
yet
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
just
beyond
the
baize
door
into
adams
s
private
part
of
the
house
he
was
lying
now
midway
between
life
and
death
horribly
tired
but
not
afraid
maddox
waited
for
the
head
to
disrobe
after
service
was
over
just
outside
the
chapel
the
school
and
then
the
masters
passed
by
him
but
he
only
nodded
at
one
and
another
and
still
waited
at
last
the
head
came
out
into
the
red
twilight
after
sunset
glad
you
waited
for
me
maddox
he
said
i
didn
t
know
you
were
down
till
just
before
is
there
anything
more
to
tell
than
what
you
told
us
all
sir
he
asked
the
head
took
his
arm
no
my
dear
fellow
he
said
it
s
not
hopeless
you
know
they
don
t
say
would
they
allow
me
to
see
him
sir
he
needn
t
know
i
did
i
could
just
look
at
him
without
his
seeing
you
must
ask
the
doctor
about
that
you
got
down
this
afternoon
only
yes
sir
i
only
heard
this
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
little
way
as
far
as
the
iron
gate
into
the
quadrangle
then
maddox
spoke
again
he
s
the
best
chap
in
the
world
sir
he
said
he
saved
me
you
know
just
saved
the
head
pressed
his
arm
ah
that
s
between
you
and
david
he
said
it
s
not
for
me
to
hear
but
i
know
you
love
him
which
is
the
only
point
please
god
you
ll
have
him
with
you
many
years
yet
and
if
not
frank
you
mustn
t
be
bitter
or
think
that
it
s
a
cruel
ordinance
that
takes
him
away
god
takes
him
and
we
must
give
even
as
david
gave
himself
when
he
just
jumped
at
that
horse
do
you
think
he
would
have
withheld
himself
if
he
had
known
what
the
result
would
have
been
not
a
bit
of
it
he
would
have
done
it
just
the
same
we
both
know
that
his
life
was
his
and
like
the
brick
he
is
he
chose
to
risk
they
walked
on
in
silence
half
across
the
quiet
quadrangle
will
you
come
and
sup
with
us
asked
the
head
presently
i
can
give
you
a
bed
too
if
you
oh
thanks
awfully
sir
said
frank
but
i
think
i
ll
go
down
to
the
house
adams
will
put
me
up
somehow
or
i
shall
sit
up
i
should
like
to
be
down
the
head
nodded
i
see
he
said
i
quite
understand
good
night
maddox
went
out
of
schoolyard
and
down
the
road
to
his
old
house
the
afterglow
of
sunset
was
fading
fast
the
road
showed
grey
between
black
hedgerows
and
as
he
crossed
the
stream
the
reflection
of
a
big
star
wavered
on
the
quiet
flowing
water
the
whole
place
was
intensely
familiar
to
him
part
of
his
blood
part
of
his
intimate
life
and
passing
the
he
remembered
how
on
a
wet
day
not
yet
three
years
ago
he
had
given
david
and
bags
elementary
instruction
in
squash
and
had
walked
down
this
same
road
afterwards
waiting
for
david
to
come
in
with
a
parcel
for
him
now
that
friend
of
his
heart
lay
between
life
and
death
in
the
house
of
which
the
lights
already
shone
between
the
he
tried
to
realise
and
again
shrank
from
realising
what
the
loss
would
mean
to
him
he
had
a
hundred
friends
alive
and
well
but
he
could
not
measure
david
by
any
of
them
he
was
just
david
there
was
no
fresh
news
when
he
got
to
the
house
he
saw
david
s
father
and
sister
for
a
minute
only
but
was
not
allowed
to
go
in
to
see
him
after
that
he
went
into
the
boys
part
of
the
house
and
found
that
bags
was
waiting
up
also
by
permission
in
the
double
prefects
study
which
he
shared
with
david
maddox
knew
it
well
it
was
the
one
he
had
managed
to
procure
for
himself
alone
the
year
that
david
came
to
the
school
and
fagged
for
him
bags
was
full
of
quiet
politeness
he
gave
maddox
the
sofa
and
since
the
rest
of
the
house
had
gone
to
bed
suggested
that
he
might
smoke
if
he
wished
adams
won
t
mind
he
said
it
s
jolly
of
you
to
come
and
keep
me
company
you
and
then
bags
could
not
speak
any
more
at
once
thanks
i
won
t
smoke
said
maddox
you
were
with
david
at
his
private
school
too
weren
t
you
yes
two
years
said
bags
and
been
pals
ever
since
same
as
me
both
of
us
david
s
friends
i
bags
forgot
to
be
shy
of
this
great
cambridge
you
should
have
seen
david
he
said
jerking
out
the
words
he
went
bang
for
that
horse
like
taking
a
header
ought
to
have
done
it
you
know
i
got
out
of
just
in
front
of
him
and
stood
oh
my
god
why
didn
t
you
said
maddox
suddenly
i
know
it
was
rotten
of
me
he
said
but
david
was
so
damned
quick
about
it
you
know
he
just
chucked
a
bag
of
macaroons
at
me
and
simply
jumped
and
then
the
wheel
went
over
him
and
he
was
dragged
along
with
the
rein
round
his
bags
gave
one
awful
sniff
and
pointed
to
a
white
paper
parcel
that
protruded
from
the
cupboard
where
tea
things
were
kept
there
they
are
he
said
he
told
me
not
to
eat
any
last
thing
he
said
and
and
i
want
to
see
him
again
so
frightfully
just
to
see
him
you
know
what
a
ripper
he
didn
t
know
how
i
liked
him
you
did
too
same
boat
isn
t
it
bags
had
no
pretence
of
fortitude
left
and
mopped
his
eyes
damn
that
horse
he
said
who
d
have
cared
if
it
had
killed
the
whole
high
street
so
long
as
david
didn
t
put
his
carcase
in
the
light
idiot
a
fellow
just
loves
him
the
more
for
it
i
keep
thinking
over
day
after
day
of
these
last
five
years
do
you
remember
when
he
was
swished
maddox
nodded
yes
jolly
well
deserved
it
too
and
he
was
so
sick
with
me
afterwards
when
i
told
him
so
but
we
made
it
up
david
said
he
was
sorry
silly
fool
as
if
he
ever
did
anything
to
a
pal
he
could
be
sorry
bags
caught
his
breath
don
t
know
what
there
was
about
him
he
said
but
there
he
was
just
david
you
know
and
he
liked
you
most
awfully
i
used
to
get
damned
jealous
sorry
if
you
the
two
sat
there
together
while
the
warm
night
with
many
stars
wheeled
overhead
above
the
sleeping
house
talking
occasionally
but
for
the
most
part
in
silence
adams
who
also
was
sitting
up
came
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
them
and
they
would
sit
all
three
together
from
the
came
no
determining
news
david
was
conscious
and
awake
and
they
had
given
him
all
the
morphia
that
they
dared
his
temperature
had
not
risen
further
but
he
was
very
much
exhausted
the
question
was
how
his
strength
would
hold
out
unless
he
got
to
sleep
this
adams
told
them
and
perhaps
they
talked
for
a
little
of
david
recalling
some
incident
of
past
days
then
adams
would
leave
them
again
to
go
back
to
david
s
father
and
sister
but
not
long
after
midnight
he
came
in
again
having
only
just
gone
out
david
has
suddenly
asked
if
you
were
here
frank
he
said
he
wants
to
see
you
and
the
doctor
thinks
you
had
better
go
to
him
he
is
getting
very
restless
and
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
quiet
him
that
s
what
they
want
you
to
do
you
can
trust
yourself
frank
got
up
yes
sir
i
know
i
can
he
said
the
room
where
he
lay
was
lit
by
a
lamp
that
was
shaded
from
the
bed
and
near
the
head
of
it
was
standing
the
doctor
who
nodded
to
frank
as
he
came
in
and
beckoned
him
to
the
bed
putting
a
chair
for
him
by
the
side
of
it
david
old
chap
here
i
am
he
said
david
turned
his
tired
eyes
to
him
oh
i
say
that
s
ripping
he
said
faintly
but
i
can
t
see
you
very
well
mayn
t
there
be
a
bit
more
light
the
doctor
quietly
tilted
the
shade
round
the
lamp
so
that
the
light
fell
on
frank
s
face
will
that
do
said
frank
yes
rather
i
wanted
to
see
you
awfully
i
wondered
if
you
would
come
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
when
you
knew
frank
am
i
going
to
die
frank
pulled
the
chair
a
little
closer
and
bent
over
him
no
he
said
you
re
going
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
we
can
t
get
on
without
you
possibly
so
you
ve
got
to
get
well
see
the
doctor
came
close
to
frank
and
whispered
to
him
tell
him
he
must
go
to
sleep
he
said
and
stepped
back
again
out
of
sight
and
to
get
well
continued
frank
you
ve
got
to
go
to
sleep
and
bring
your
strength
back
david
don
t
you
remember
our
two
beds
at
the
end
of
dormitory
well
think
yourself
back
in
yours
with
me
in
the
one
next
you
and
imagine
it
s
time
to
go
to
sleep
it
s
quite
easy
you
know
imagine
it
s
that
jolly
evening
after
our
last
year
when
you
were
so
tired
you
fell
asleep
without
yes
i
remember
said
david
he
was
silent
a
little
but
his
eyes
were
still
wide
i
say
would
it
bore
you
awfully
to
hold
my
hand
he
said
you
re
so
strong
and
fit
and
quiet
i
might
get
some
i
don
t
know
am
i
talking
rot
no
not
a
bit
there
frank
fitted
his
hand
into
david
s
which
lay
like
a
sick
child
within
it
yes
ripping
said
he
a
little
drowsily
sure
it
s
not
an
awful
bore
it
s
a
frightful
bore
said
frank
david
smiled
you
didn
t
get
a
rise
out
of
me
he
said
shall
have
another
try
before
long
said
frank
comfortable
david
lay
for
some
ten
minutes
still
but
quiet
then
his
eyelids
fluttered
closed
and
opened
again
awfully
comfortable
he
said
i
wanted
just
you
to
tell
me
what
to
do
i
did
so
want
you
to
david
s
eyelids
dropped
again
and
the
doctor
came
round
to
maddox
s
side
sit
quite
still
he
whispered
and
don
t
speak
to
him
sure
it
doesn
t
bore
you
asked
david
once
more
again
there
was
silence
and
the
two
the
friend
and
the
doctor
remained
absolutely
still
for
some
five
minutes
then
from
the
bed
came
a
long
sigh
david
s
head
rolled
a
little
sideways
on
the
pillow
and
after
that
came
the
quiet
regular
breathing
then
the
doctor
whispered
once
more
to
maddox
you
may
have
to
sit
like
that
with
your
arm
out
for
hours
he
said
we
ll
try
to
make
you
comfortable
presently
can
you
manage
it
why
yes
said
he
the
doctor
quietly
left
the
room
but
came
back
soon
after
with
pillows
and
as
well
as
he
could
propped
up
maddox
s
outstretched
arm
then
he
spoke
to
the
nurse
who
was
to
sit
up
and
came
back
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
david
a
moment
listening
to
his
regular
breathing
i
m
going
to
get
a
bit
of
sleep
now
he
whispered
to
frank
but
i
m
afraid
you
won
t
you
must
stop
just
as
you
are
if
he
lets
go
of
your
hand
you
must
still
sit
there
in
case
he
wakes
and
asks
for
you
if
he
says
anything
answer
him
as
if
he
was
in
his
dormitory
and
you
in
the
bed
next
him
you
re
in
it
was
a
couple
of
hours
before
david
moved
then
he
turned
a
little
in
bed
frank
he
said
oh
shut
up
and
go
to
sleep
said
frank
tisn
t
right
oh
said
david
all
sensation
had
gone
from
maddox
s
arm
it
was
quite
numb
up
to
the
shoulder
and
it
was
only
with
his
eyes
that
presently
after
he
knew
that
david
had
let
his
hand
slip
from
his
own
then
very
gently
he
withdrew
it
and
it
fell
helplessly
on
to
his
knees
david
slept
on
through
the
hour
before
dawn
when
the
flame
of
vitality
burns
dim
and
the
dying
loose
their
hold
on
life
until
through
the
curtains
the
pale
light
of
morning
looked
in
dimming
the
outside
the
twitter
of
birds
began
and
the
hushed
sounds
of
life
stole
about
within
the
house
and
the
nurse
moved
quietly
to
and
fro
in
the
room
setting
things
in
order
for
the
day
she
brought
frank
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
bread
and
butter
and
he
ate
and
drank
without
moving
from
the
bedside
before
long
the
doctor
paid
his
promised
visit
but
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
now
that
sleep
had
come
to
david
the
immediate
necessity
was
fulfilled
and
beyond
that
there
was
no
need
to
look
at
present
only
hope
the
little
white
flame
which
had
burned
so
dim
and
had
come
so
near
to
being
quenched
the
evening
before
shone
more
bravely
all
that
morning
maddox
sat
by
david
s
bed
as
he
slept
it
was
he
who
had
brought
to
him
through
the
tie
of
their
love
and
david
s
instinctive
obedience
to
his
suggestion
the
sleep
that
had
been
so
imperative
a
need
and
the
sunny
morning
grew
broad
and
hot
as
he
dozed
sometimes
but
oftener
watched
filled
with
a
huge
and
humble
exultation
of
happiness
that
he
had
been
able
to
help
david
and
when
david
woke
as
he
did
a
little
after
noon
it
was
the
best
of
all
for
even
while
his
eyes
were
yet
scarcely
unclosed
he
spoke
just
one
s
name
still
sleepily
oh
go
to
sleep
said
frank
just
as
he
had
said
it
twelve
hours
before
no
early
but
this
time
david
reasserted
himself
a
little
course
not
he
said
but
i
ve
slept
ages
i
want
something
to
the
beaming
nurse
stepped
to
the
bedside
i
ll
bring
you
some
in
a
minute
she
said
lie
quite
david
turned
his
head
why
it
s
quite
morning
he
said
absolutely
said
frank
and
i
ve
slept
ever
since
you
told
me
we
were
in
dormitory
together
he
said
how
long
ago
was
that
oh
about
twelve
hours
said
frank
and
you
ve
sat
here
all
the
time
think
oh
i
say
and
just
because
you
thought
i
might
want
david
s
eyes
were
bright
and
untired
again
there
was
life
shining
behind
them
young
life
that
may
still
be
feeble
as
the
snowdrops
raising
their
frail
heads
above
the
ground
on
some
sunny
morning
of
february
are
feeble
but
they
answer
to
the
beckoning
of
spring
not
like
late
autumn
blossoms
feeling
the
chill
of
the
winter
that
approaches
frank
leaned
over
him
yes
i
thought
you
might
want
me
he
