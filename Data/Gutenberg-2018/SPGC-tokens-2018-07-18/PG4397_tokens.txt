to

dedicate
the

saga
in
its
entirety
believing
it
to
be
of
all
my
works
the
least

encouragement

and
criticism
i
could
never

such
a
writer
as
i

preface
the
forsyte
saga
was
the
title
originally
destined
for
that
part
of
it
which
is
called
the
man
of
property
and
to
adopt
it
for
the
collected
chronicles
of
the
forsyte
family
has
indulged
the
forsytean
tenacity
that
is
in
all
of
us
the
word
saga
might
be
objected
to
on
the
ground
that
it
connotes
the
heroic
and
that
there
is
little
heroism
in
these
pages
but
it
is
used
with
a
suitable
irony
and
after
all
this
long
tale
though
it
may
deal
with
folk
in
frock
coats
furbelows
and
a
period
is
not
devoid
of
the
essential
heat
of
conflict
discounting
for
the
gigantic
stature
and
of
old
days
as
they
have
come
down
to
us
in
and
legend
the
folk
of
the
old
sagas
were
forsytes
assuredly
in
their
possessive
instincts
and
as
little
proof
against
the
inroads
of
beauty
and
passion
as
swithin
soames
or
even
young
jolyon
and
if
heroic
figures
in
days
that
never
were
seem
to
startle
out
from
their
surroundings
in
fashion
unbecoming
to
a
forsyte
of
the
victorian
era
we
may
be
sure
that
tribal
instinct
was
even
then
the
prime
force
and
that
family
and
the
sense
of
home
and
property
counted
as
they
do
to
this
day
for
all
the
recent
efforts
to
talk
them
so
many
people
have
written
and
claimed
that
their
families
were
the
originals
of
the
forsytes
that
one
has
been
almost
encouraged
to
believe
in
the
typicality
of
an
imagined
species
manners
change
and
modes
evolve
and
timothy
on
the
bayswater
road
becomes
a
nest
of
the
unbelievable
in
all
except
essentials
we
shall
not
look
upon
its
like
again
nor
perhaps
on
such
a
one
as
james
or
old
jolyon
and
yet
the
figures
of
insurance
societies
and
the
utterances
of
judges
reassure
us
daily
that
our
earthly
paradise
is
still
a
rich
preserve
where
the
wild
raiders
beauty
and
passion
come
stealing
in
filching
security
from
beneath
our
noses
as
surely
as
a
dog
will
bark
at
a
brass
band
so
will
the
essential
soames
in
human
nature
ever
rise
up
uneasily
against
the
dissolution
which
hovers
round
the
folds
of
ownership
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
would
be
a
better
saying
if
the
past
ever
died
the
persistence
of
the
past
is
one
of
those
blessings
which
each
new
age
denies
coming
cocksure
on
to
the
stage
to
mouth
its
claim
to
a
perfect
novelty
but
no
age
is
so
new
as
that
human
nature
under
its
changing
pretensions
and
clothes
is
and
ever
will
be
very
much
of
a
forsyte
and
might
after
all
be
a
much
worse
animal
looking
back
on
the
victorian
era
whose
ripeness
decline
and
is
in
some
sort
pictured
in
the
forsyte
saga
we
see
now
that
we
have
but
jumped
out
of
a
into
a
fire
it
would
be
difficult
to
substantiate
a
claim
that
the
case
of
england
was
better
in
than
it
was
in
when
the
forsytes
assembled
at
old
jolyon
to
celebrate
the
engagement
of
june
to
philip
bosinney
and
in
when
again
the
clan
gathered
to
bless
the
marriage
of
fleur
with
michael
mont
the
state
of
england
is
as
surely
too
molten
and
bankrupt
as
in
the
eighties
it
was
too
congealed
and
if
these
chronicles
had
been
a
really
scientific
study
of
transition
one
would
have
dwelt
probably
on
such
factors
as
the
invention
of
bicycle
and
the
arrival
of
a
cheap
press
the
decline
of
country
life
and
increase
of
the
towns
the
birth
of
the
cinema
men
are
in
fact
quite
unable
to
control
their
own
inventions
they
at
best
develop
adaptability
to
the
new
conditions
those
inventions
create
but
this
long
tale
is
no
scientific
study
of
a
period
it
is
rather
an
intimate
incarnation
of
the
disturbance
that
beauty
effects
in
the
lives
of
men
the
figure
of
irene
never
as
the
reader
may
possibly
have
observed
present
except
through
the
senses
of
other
characters
is
a
concretion
of
disturbing
beauty
impinging
on
a
possessive
world
one
has
noticed
that
readers
as
they
wade
on
through
the
salt
waters
of
the
saga
are
inclined
more
and
more
to
pity
soames
and
to
think
that
in
doing
so
they
are
in
revolt
against
the
mood
of
his
creator
far
from
it
he
too
pities
soames
the
tragedy
of
whose
life
is
the
very
simple
uncontrollable
tragedy
of
being
unlovable
without
quite
a
thick
enough
skin
to
be
thoroughly
unconscious
of
the
fact
not
even
fleur
loves
soames
as
he
feels
he
ought
to
be
loved
but
in
pitying
soames
readers
incline
perhaps
to
animus
against
irene
after
all
they
think
he
was
a
bad
fellow
it
was
his
fault
she
ought
to
have
forgiven
him
and
so
on
and
taking
sides
they
lose
perception
of
the
simple
truth
which
underlies
the
whole
story
that
where
sex
attraction
is
utterly
and
definitely
lacking
in
one
partner
to
a
union
no
amount
of
pity
or
reason
or
duty
or
what
not
can
overcome
a
repulsion
implicit
in
nature
whether
it
ought
to
or
no
is
beside
the
point
because
in
fact
it
never
does
and
where
irene
seems
hard
and
cruel
as
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
or
the
goupenor
gallery
she
is
but
wisely
that
the
least
concession
is
the
inch
which
precedes
the
impossible
the
repulsive
ell
a
criticism
one
might
pass
on
the
last
phase
of
the
saga
is
the
complaint
that
irene
and
jolyon
those
rebels
against
spiritual
property
in
their
son
jon
but
it
would
be
hypercriticism
as
the
tale
is
told
no
father
and
mother
could
have
let
the
boy
marry
fleur
without
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
the
facts
determine
jon
not
the
persuasion
of
his
parents
moreover
jolyon
persuasion
is
not
on
his
own
account
but
on
irene
and
irene
persuasion
becomes
a
reiterated
do
think
of
me
think
of
yourself
that
jon
knowing
the
facts
can
realise
his
mother
feelings
will
hardly
with
justice
be
held
proof
that
she
is
after
all
a
forsyte
but
though
the
impingement
of
beauty
and
the
claims
of
freedom
on
a
possessive
world
are
the
main
prepossessions
of
the
forsyte
saga
it
can
not
be
absolved
from
the
charge
of
embalming
the
class
as
the
old
egyptians
placed
around
their
mummies
the
necessaries
of
a
future
existence
so
i
have
endeavoured
to
lay
beside
the
figures
of
aunts
ann
and
juley
and
hester
of
timothy
and
swithin
of
old
jolyon
and
james
and
of
their
sons
that
which
shall
guarantee
them
a
little
life
a
little
balm
in
the
hurried
gilead
of
a
dissolving
if
the
class
with
other
classes
is
destined
to
move
on
into
amorphism
here
pickled
in
these
pages
it
lies
under
glass
for
strollers
in
the
wide
and
museum
of
letters
here
it
rests
preserved
in
its
own
juice
the
sense
of
property
the

property
by
john
galsworthy

edward

part
i
chapter
home
at
old
those
privileged
to
be
present
at
a
family
festival
of
the
forsytes
have
seen
that
charming
and
instructive
upper
family
in
full
plumage
but
whosoever
of
these
favoured
persons
has
possessed
the
gift
of
psychological
analysis
a
talent
without
monetary
value
and
properly
ignored
by
the
forsytes
has
witnessed
a
spectacle
not
only
delightful
in
itself
but
illustrative
of
an
obscure
human
problem
in
plainer
words
he
has
gleaned
from
a
gathering
of
this
branch
of
which
had
a
liking
for
the
other
between
no
three
members
of
whom
existed
anything
worthy
of
the
name
of
of
that
mysterious
concrete
tenacity
which
renders
a
family
so
formidable
a
unit
of
society
so
clear
a
reproduction
of
society
in
miniature
he
has
been
admitted
to
a
vision
of
the
dim
roads
of
social
progress
has
understood
something
of
patriarchal
life
of
the
swarmings
of
savage
hordes
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
nations
he
is
like
one
who
having
watched
a
tree
grow
from
its
paragon
of
tenacity
insulation
and
success
amidst
the
deaths
of
a
hundred
other
plants
less
fibrous
sappy
and
day
will
see
it
flourishing
with
bland
full
foliage
in
an
almost
repugnant
prosperity
at
the
summit
of
its
efflorescence
on
june
eighteen
about
four
of
the
afternoon
the
observer
who
chanced
to
be
present
at
the
house
of
old
jolyon
forsyte
in
stanhope
gate
might
have
seen
the
highest
efflorescence
of
the
forsytes
this
was
the
occasion
of
an
home
to
celebrate
the
engagement
of
miss
june
forsyte
old
jolyon
granddaughter
to
philip
bosinney
in
the
bravery
of
light
gloves
buff
waistcoats
feathers
and
frocks
the
family
were
present
even
aunt
ann
who
now
but
seldom
left
the
corner
of
her
brother
timothy
green
where
under
the
aegis
of
a
plume
of
dyed
pampas
grass
in
a
light
blue
vase
she
sat
all
day
reading
and
knitting
surrounded
by
the
effigies
of
three
generations
of
forsytes
even
aunt
ann
was
there
her
inflexible
back
and
the
dignity
of
her
calm
old
face
personifying
the
rigid
possessiveness
of
the
family
idea
when
a
forsyte
was
engaged
married
or
born
the
forsytes
were
present
when
a
forsyte
no
forsyte
had
as
yet
died
they
did
not
die
death
being
contrary
to
their
principles
they
took
precautions
against
it
the
instinctive
precautions
of
highly
vitalized
persons
who
resent
encroachments
on
their
property
about
the
forsytes
mingling
that
day
with
the
crowd
of
other
guests
there
was
a
more
than
ordinarily
groomed
look
an
alert
inquisitive
assurance
a
brilliant
respectability
as
though
they
were
attired
in
defiance
of
something
the
habitual
sniff
on
the
face
of
soames
forsyte
had
spread
through
their
ranks
they
were
on
their
guard
the
subconscious
offensiveness
of
their
attitude
has
constituted
old
jolyon
the
psychological
moment
of
the
family
history
made
it
the
prelude
of
their
drama
the
forsytes
were
resentful
of
something
not
individually
but
as
a
family
this
resentment
expressed
itself
in
an
added
perfection
of
raiment
an
exuberance
of
family
cordiality
an
exaggeration
of
family
importance
sniff
indispensable
in
bringing
out
the
fundamental
quality
of
any
society
group
or
what
the
forsytes
scented
the
premonition
of
danger
put
a
burnish
on
their
armour
for
the
first
time
as
a
family
they
appeared
to
have
an
instinct
of
being
in
contact
with
some
strange
and
unsafe
thing
over
against
the
piano
a
man
of
bulk
and
stature
was
wearing
two
waistcoats
on
his
wide
chest
two
waistcoats
and
a
ruby
pin
instead
of
the
single
satin
waistcoat
and
diamond
pin
of
more
usual
occasions
and
his
shaven
square
old
face
the
colour
of
pale
leather
with
pale
eyes
had
its
most
dignified
look
above
his
satin
stock
this
was
swithin
forsyte
close
to
the
window
where
he
could
get
more
than
his
fair
share
of
fresh
air
the
other
twin
fat
and
the
lean
of
it
old
jolyon
called
these
the
bulky
swithin
over
six
feet
in
height
but
very
lean
as
though
destined
from
his
birth
to
strike
a
balance
and
maintain
an
average
brooded
over
the
scene
with
his
permanent
stoop
his
grey
eyes
had
an
air
of
fixed
absorption
in
some
secret
worry
broken
at
intervals
by
a
rapid
shifting
scrutiny
of
surrounding
facts
his
cheeks
thinned
by
two
parallel
folds
and
a
long
upper
lip
were
framed
within
dundreary
whiskers
in
his
hands
he
turned
and
turned
a
piece
of
china
not
far
off
listening
to
a
lady
in
brown
his
only
son
soames
pale
and
rather
bald
had
poked
his
chin
up
sideways
carrying
his
nose
with
that
aforesaid
appearance
of
as
though
despising
an
egg
which
he
knew
he
could
not
digest
behind
him
his
cousin
the
tall
george
son
of
the
fifth
forsyte
roger
had
a
quilpish
look
on
his
fleshy
face
pondering
one
of
his
sardonic
jests
something
inherent
to
the
occasion
had
affected
them
all
seated
in
a
row
close
to
one
another
were
three
ann
hester
the
two
forsyte
maids
and
juley
short
for
julia
who
not
in
first
youth
had
so
far
forgotten
herself
as
to
marry
septimus
small
a
man
of
poor
constitution
she
had
survived
him
for
many
years
with
her
elder
and
younger
sister
she
lived
now
in
the
house
of
timothy
her
sixth
and
youngest
brother
on
the
bayswater
road
each
of
these
ladies
held
fans
in
their
hands
and
each
with
some
touch
of
colour
some
emphatic
feather
or
brooch
testified
to
the
solemnity
of
the
opportunity
in
the
centre
of
the
room
under
the
chandelier
as
became
a
host
stood
the
head
of
the
family
old
jolyon
himself
eighty
years
of
age
with
his
fine
white
hair
his
forehead
his
little
dark
grey
eyes
and
an
immense
white
moustache
which
drooped
and
spread
below
the
level
of
his
strong
jaw
he
had
a
patriarchal
look
and
in
spite
of
lean
cheeks
and
hollows
at
his
temples
seemed
master
of
perennial
youth
he
held
himself
extremely
upright
and
his
shrewd
steady
eyes
had
lost
none
of
their
clear
shining
thus
he
gave
an
impression
of
superiority
to
the
doubts
and
dislikes
of
smaller
men
having
had
his
own
way
for
innumerable
years
he
had
earned
a
prescriptive
right
to
it
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
old
jolyon
that
it
was
necessary
to
wear
a
look
of
doubt
or
of
defiance
between
him
and
the
four
other
brothers
who
were
present
james
swithin
nicholas
and
roger
there
was
much
difference
much
similarity
in
turn
each
of
these
four
brothers
was
very
different
from
the
other
yet
they
too
were
alike
through
the
varying
features
and
expression
of
those
five
faces
could
be
marked
a
certain
steadfastness
of
chin
underlying
surface
distinctions
marking
a
racial
stamp
too
prehistoric
to
trace
too
remote
and
permanent
to
very
and
guarantee
of
the
family
fortunes
among
the
younger
generation
in
the
tall
george
in
pallid
strenuous
archibald
in
young
nicholas
with
his
sweet
and
tentative
obstinacy
in
the
grave
and
foppishly
determined
eustace
there
was
this
same
meaningful
perhaps
but
sign
of
something
ineradicable
in
the
family
soul
at
one
time
or
another
during
the
afternoon
all
these
faces
so
dissimilar
and
so
alike
had
worn
an
expression
of
distrust
the
object
of
which
was
undoubtedly
the
man
whose
acquaintance
they
were
thus
assembled
to
make
philip
bosinney
was
known
to
be
a
young
man
without
fortune
but
forsyte
girls
had
become
engaged
to
such
before
and
had
actually
married
them
it
was
not
altogether
for
this
reason
therefore
that
the
minds
of
the
forsytes
misgave
them
they
could
not
have
explained
the
origin
of
a
misgiving
obscured
by
the
mist
of
family
gossip
a
story
was
undoubtedly
told
that
he
had
paid
his
duty
call
to
aunts
ann
juley
and
hester
in
a
soft
grey
soft
grey
hat
not
even
a
new
dusty
thing
with
a
shapeless
crown
so
extraordinary
my
odd
aunt
hester
passing
through
the
little
dark
hall
she
was
rather
had
tried
to
it
off
a
chair
taking
it
for
a
strange
disreputable
had
such
disgraceful
friends
she
was
disturbed
when
it
did
not
move
like
an
artist
for
ever
seeking
to
discover
the
significant
trifle
which
embodies
the
whole
character
of
a
scene
or
place
or
person
so
those
unconscious
forsytes
had
fastened
by
intuition
on
this
hat
it
was
their
significant
trifle
the
detail
in
which
was
embedded
the
meaning
of
the
whole
matter
for
each
had
asked
himself
come
now
should
i
have
paid
that
visit
in
that
hat
and
each
had
answered
no
and
some
with
more
imagination
than
others
had
added
it
would
never
have
come
into
my
head
george
on
hearing
the
story
grinned
the
hat
had
obviously
been
worn
as
a
practical
joke
he
himself
was
a
connoisseur
of
such
very
haughty
he
said
the
wild
and
this
mot
the
was
bandied
from
mouth
to
mouth
till
it
became
the
favourite
mode
of
alluding
to
bosinney
her
aunts
reproached
june
afterwards
about
the
hat
we
do
think
you
ought
to
let
him
dear
they
had
said
june
had
answered
in
her
imperious
brisk
way
like
the
little
embodiment
of
will
she
was
oh
what
does
it
matter
phil
never
knows
what
got
on
no
one
had
credited
an
answer
so
outrageous
a
man
not
to
know
what
he
had
on
no
no
what
indeed
was
this
young
man
who
in
becoming
engaged
to
june
old
jolyon
acknowledged
heiress
had
done
so
well
for
himself
he
was
an
architect
not
in
itself
a
sufficient
reason
for
wearing
such
a
hat
none
of
the
forsytes
happened
to
be
architects
but
one
of
them
knew
two
architects
who
would
never
have
worn
such
a
hat
upon
a
call
of
ceremony
in
the
london
season
dangerous
june
of
course
had
not
seen
this
but
though
not
yet
nineteen
she
was
notorious
had
she
not
said
to
was
always
so
beautifully
feathers
were
vulgar
soames
had
actually
given
up
wearing
feathers
so
dreadfully
downright
was
dear
june
these
misgivings
this
disapproval
and
perfectly
genuine
distrust
did
not
prevent
the
forsytes
from
gathering
to
old
jolyon
invitation
an
home
at
stanhope
gate
was
a
great
rarity
none
had
been
held
for
twelve
years
not
indeed
since
old
jolyon
had
died
never
had
there
been
so
full
an
assembly
for
mysteriously
united
in
spite
of
all
their
differences
they
had
taken
arms
against
a
common
peril
like
cattle
when
a
dog
comes
into
the
field
they
stood
head
to
head
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
prepared
to
run
upon
and
trample
the
invader
to
death
they
had
come
too
no
doubt
to
get
some
notion
of
what
sort
of
presents
they
would
ultimately
be
expected
to
give
for
though
the
question
of
wedding
gifts
was
usually
graduated
in
this
way
are
you
givin
nicholas
is
givin
spoons
very
much
depended
on
the
bridegroom
if
he
were
sleek
it
was
more
necessary
to
give
him
nice
things
he
would
expect
them
in
the
end
each
gave
exactly
what
was
right
and
proper
by
a
species
of
family
adjustment
arrived
at
as
prices
are
arrived
at
on
the
stock
exact
niceties
being
regulated
at
timothy
commodious
residence
in
bayswater
overlooking
the
park
where
dwelt
aunts
ann
juley
and
hester
the
uneasiness
of
the
forsyte
family
has
been
justified
by
the
simple
mention
of
the
hat
how
impossible
and
wrong
would
it
have
been
for
any
family
with
the
regard
for
appearances
which
should
ever
characterize
the
great
upper
to
feel
otherwise
than
uneasy
the
author
of
the
uneasiness
stood
talking
to
june
by
the
further
door
his
curly
hair
had
a
rumpled
appearance
as
though
he
found
what
was
going
on
around
him
unusual
he
had
an
air
too
of
having
a
joke
all
to
himself
george
speaking
aside
to
his
brother
eustace
said
looks
as
if
he
might
make
a
bolt
of
dashing
buccaneer
this
man
as
small
afterwards
called
him
was
of
medium
height
and
strong
build
with
a
pale
brown
face
a
moustache
very
prominent
and
hollow
checks
his
forehead
sloped
back
towards
the
crown
of
his
head
and
bulged
out
in
bumps
over
the
eyes
like
foreheads
seen
in
the
at
the
zoo
he
had
eyes
disconcertingly
inattentive
at
times
old
jolyon
coachman
after
driving
june
and
bosinney
to
the
theatre
had
remarked
to
the
butler
i
dunno
what
to
make
of
looks
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
an
and
every
now
and
then
a
forsyte
would
come
up
sidle
round
and
take
a
look
at
him
june
stood
in
front
fending
off
this
idle
little
bit
of
a
thing
as
somebody
once
said
hair
and
spirit
with
fearless
blue
eyes
a
firm
jaw
and
a
bright
colour
whose
face
and
body
seemed
too
slender
for
her
crown
of
hair
a
tall
woman
with
a
beautiful
figure
which
some
member
of
the
family
had
once
compared
to
a
heathen
goddess
stood
looking
at
these
two
with
a
shadowy
smile
her
hands
gloved
in
french
grey
were
crossed
one
over
the
other
her
grave
charming
face
held
to
one
side
and
the
eyes
of
all
men
near
were
fastened
on
it
her
figure
swayed
so
balanced
that
the
very
air
seemed
to
set
it
moving
there
was
warmth
but
little
colour
in
her
cheeks
her
large
dark
eyes
were
soft
but
it
was
at
her
a
question
giving
an
answer
with
that
shadowy
men
looked
they
were
sensitive
lips
sensuous
and
sweet
and
through
them
seemed
to
come
warmth
and
perfume
like
the
warmth
and
perfume
of
a
flower
the
engaged
couple
thus
scrutinized
were
unconscious
of
this
passive
goddess
it
was
bosinney
who
first
noticed
her
and
asked
her
name
june
took
her
lover
up
to
the
woman
with
the
beautiful
figure
irene
is
my
greatest
chum
she
said
please
be
good
friends
you
two
at
the
little
lady
command
they
all
three
smiled
and
while
they
were
smiling
soames
forsyte
silently
appearing
from
behind
the
woman
with
the
beautiful
figure
who
was
his
wife
said
ah
introduce
me
too
he
was
seldom
indeed
far
from
irene
side
at
public
functions
and
even
when
separated
by
the
exigencies
of
social
intercourse
could
be
seen
following
her
about
with
his
eyes
in
which
were
strange
expressions
of
watchfulness
and
longing
at
the
window
his
father
james
was
still
scrutinizing
the
marks
on
the
piece
of
china
i
wonder
at
jolyon
allowing
this
engagement
he
said
to
aunt
ann
they
tell
me
there
no
chance
of
their
getting
married
for
years
this
young
bosinney
he
made
the
word
a
dactyl
in
opposition
to
general
usage
of
a
short
o
has
got
nothing
when
winifred
married
dartie
i
made
him
bring
every
penny
into
thing
had
nothing
by
this
time
aunt
ann
looked
up
from
her
velvet
chair
grey
curls
banded
her
forehead
curls
that
unchanged
for
decades
had
extinguished
in
the
family
all
sense
of
time
she
made
no
reply
for
she
rarely
spoke
husbanding
her
aged
voice
but
to
james
uneasy
of
conscience
her
look
was
as
good
as
an
answer
well
he
said
i
could
help
irene
having
no
money
soames
was
in
such
a
hurry
he
got
quite
thin
dancing
attendance
on
putting
the
bowl
pettishly
down
on
the
piano
he
let
his
eyes
wander
to
the
group
by
the
door
it
my
opinion
he
said
unexpectedly
that
it
just
as
well
as
it
aunt
ann
did
not
ask
him
to
explain
this
strange
utterance
she
knew
what
he
was
thinking
if
irene
had
no
money
she
would
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
do
anything
wrong
for
they
had
been
asking
for
a
separate
room
but
of
course
soames
had
not
james
interrupted
her
reverie
but
where
he
asked
was
timothy
had
he
come
with
them
through
aunt
ann
compressed
lips
a
tender
smile
forced
its
way
no
he
did
think
it
wise
with
so
much
of
this
diphtheria
about
and
he
so
liable
to
take
james
answered
well
he
takes
good
care
of
himself
i
ca
afford
to
take
the
care
of
myself
that
he
nor
was
it
easy
to
say
which
of
admiration
envy
or
contempt
was
dominant
in
that
remark
timothy
indeed
was
seldom
seen
the
baby
of
the
family
a
publisher
by
profession
he
had
some
years
before
when
business
was
at
full
tide
scented
out
the
stagnation
which
indeed
had
not
yet
come
but
which
ultimately
as
all
agreed
was
bound
to
set
in
and
selling
his
share
in
a
firm
engaged
mainly
in
the
production
of
religious
books
had
invested
the
quite
conspicuous
proceeds
in
three
per
cent
consols
by
this
act
he
had
at
once
assumed
an
isolated
position
no
other
forsyte
being
content
with
less
than
four
per
cent
for
his
money
and
this
isolation
had
slowly
and
surely
undermined
a
spirit
perhaps
better
than
commonly
endowed
with
caution
he
had
become
almost
a
kind
of
incarnation
of
security
haunting
the
background
of
the
forsyte
universe
he
had
never
committed
the
imprudence
of
marrying
or
encumbering
himself
in
any
way
with
children
james
resumed
tapping
the
piece
of
china
this
is
real
old
worcester
i
jolyon
told
you
something
about
the
young
man
from
all
i
can
learn
he
got
no
business
no
income
and
no
connection
worth
speaking
of
but
then
i
know
tells
me
aunt
ann
shook
her
head
over
her
aquiline
old
face
a
trembling
passed
the
spidery
fingers
of
her
hands
pressed
against
each
other
and
interlaced
as
though
she
were
subtly
recharging
her
will
the
eldest
by
some
years
of
all
the
forsytes
she
held
a
peculiar
position
amongst
them
opportunists
and
egotists
one
and
not
indeed
more
so
than
their
quailed
before
her
incorruptible
figure
and
when
opportunities
were
too
strong
what
could
they
do
but
avoid
her
twisting
his
long
thin
legs
james
went
on
jolyon
he
will
have
his
own
way
he
got
no
children
stopped
recollecting
the
continued
existence
of
old
jolyon
son
young
jolyon
june
father
who
had
made
such
a
mess
of
it
and
done
for
himself
by
deserting
his
wife
and
child
and
running
away
with
that
foreign
governess
well
he
resumed
hastily
if
he
likes
to
do
these
things
i
he
can
afford
to
now
what
he
going
to
give
her
i
he
give
her
a
thousand
a
year
he
got
nobody
else
to
leave
his
money
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
meet
that
of
a
dapper
man
with
hardly
a
hair
on
his
head
a
long
broken
nose
full
lips
and
cold
grey
eyes
under
rectangular
brows
well
nick
he
muttered
how
are
you
nicholas
forsyte
with
his
rapidity
and
the
look
of
a
preternaturally
sage
schoolboy
he
had
made
a
large
fortune
quite
legitimately
out
of
the
companies
of
which
he
was
a
director
placed
within
that
cold
palm
the
tips
of
his
still
colder
fingers
and
hastily
withdrew
them
i
bad
he
said
been
bad
all
the
week
do
sleep
at
night
the
doctor
ca
tell
why
he
a
clever
fellow
or
i
have
him
but
i
get
nothing
out
of
him
but
doctors
said
james
coming
down
sharp
on
his
words
i
had
all
the
doctors
in
london
for
one
or
another
of
us
there
no
satisfaction
to
be
got
out
of
them
they
tell
you
anything
there
swithin
now
what
good
have
they
done
him
there
he
is
he
bigger
than
ever
enormous
they
ca
get
his
weight
down
look
at
him
swithin
forsyte
tall
square
and
broad
with
a
chest
like
a
pouter
pigeon
in
its
plumage
of
bright
waistcoats
came
strutting
towards
them
are
you
he
said
in
his
dandified
way
aspirating
the
strongly
this
difficult
letter
was
almost
absolutely
safe
in
his
keeping
how
are
you
each
brother
wore
an
air
of
aggravation
as
he
looked
at
the
other
two
knowing
by
experience
that
they
would
try
to
eclipse
his
ailments
we
were
just
saying
said
james
that
you
do
get
any
swithin
protruded
his
pale
round
eyes
with
the
effort
of
hearing
thinner
i
in
good
case
he
said
leaning
a
little
forward
not
one
of
your
like
you
but
afraid
of
losing
the
expansion
of
his
chest
he
leaned
back
again
into
a
state
of
immobility
for
he
prized
nothing
so
highly
as
a
distinguished
appearance
aunt
ann
turned
her
old
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
indulgent
and
severe
was
her
look
in
turn
the
three
brothers
looked
at
ann
she
was
getting
shaky
wonderful
woman
if
a
day
might
live
another
ten
years
and
had
never
been
strong
swithin
and
james
the
twins
were
only
nicholas
a
mere
baby
of
seventy
or
so
all
were
strong
and
the
inference
was
comforting
of
all
forms
of
property
their
respective
healths
naturally
concerned
them
most
i
very
well
in
myself
proceeded
james
but
my
nerves
are
out
of
order
the
least
thing
worries
me
to
death
i
shall
have
to
go
to
bath
said
nicholas
i
tried
harrogate
that
no
good
what
i
want
is
sea
air
there
nothing
like
yarmouth
now
when
i
go
there
i
sleep
my
liver
very
bad
interrupted
swithin
slowly
dreadful
pain
here
and
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
right
side
want
of
exercise
muttered
james
his
eyes
on
the
china
he
quickly
added
i
get
a
pain
there
swithin
reddened
a
resemblance
to
a
coming
upon
his
old
face
exercise
he
said
i
take
plenty
i
never
use
the
lift
at
the
i
did
know
james
hurried
out
i
know
nothing
about
anybody
nobody
tells
me
anything
swithin
fixed
him
with
a
stare
what
do
you
do
for
a
pain
there
james
brightened
i
take
a
compound
how
are
you
uncle
june
stood
before
him
her
resolute
small
face
raised
from
her
little
height
to
his
great
height
and
her
hand
outheld
the
brightness
faded
from
james
visage
how
are
you
he
said
brooding
over
her
so
you
going
to
wales
to
visit
your
young
man
aunts
you
have
a
lot
of
rain
there
this
is
real
old
he
tapped
the
bowl
now
that
set
i
gave
your
mother
when
she
married
was
the
genuine
june
shook
hands
one
by
one
with
her
three
and
turned
to
aunt
ann
a
very
sweet
look
had
come
into
the
old
lady
face
she
kissed
the
girl
check
with
trembling
fervour
well
my
dear
she
said
and
so
you
going
for
a
whole
month
the
girl
passed
on
and
aunt
ann
looked
after
her
slim
little
figure
the
old
lady
round
steel
grey
eyes
over
which
a
film
like
a
was
beginning
to
come
followed
her
wistfully
amongst
the
bustling
crowd
for
people
were
beginning
to
say
and
her
pressing
and
pressing
against
each
other
were
busy
again
with
the
recharging
of
her
will
against
that
inevitable
ultimate
departure
of
her
own
she
thought
been
most
kind
quite
a
lot
of
people
come
to
congratulate
her
she
ought
to
be
very
happy
amongst
the
throng
of
people
by
the
door
the
throng
drawn
from
the
families
of
lawyers
and
doctors
from
the
stock
exchange
and
all
the
innumerable
avocations
of
the
were
only
some
twenty
percent
of
forsytes
but
to
aunt
ann
they
seemed
all
certainly
there
was
not
much
saw
only
her
own
flesh
and
blood
it
was
her
world
this
family
and
she
knew
no
other
had
never
perhaps
known
any
other
all
their
little
secrets
illnesses
engagements
and
marriages
how
they
were
getting
on
and
whether
they
were
making
this
was
her
property
her
delight
her
life
beyond
this
only
a
vague
shadowy
mist
of
facts
and
persons
of
no
real
significance
this
it
was
that
she
would
have
to
lay
down
when
it
came
to
her
turn
to
die
this
which
gave
to
her
that
importance
that
secret
without
which
none
of
us
can
bear
to
live
and
to
this
she
clung
wistfully
with
a
greed
that
grew
each
day
if
life
were
slipping
away
from
her
this
she
would
retain
to
the
end
she
thought
of
june
father
young
jolyon
who
had
run
away
with
that
foreign
girl
and
what
a
sad
blow
to
his
father
and
to
them
all
such
a
promising
young
fellow
a
sad
blow
though
there
had
been
no
public
scandal
most
fortunately
jo
wife
seeking
for
no
divorce
a
long
time
ago
and
when
june
mother
died
six
years
ago
jo
had
married
that
woman
and
they
had
two
children
now
so
she
had
heard
still
he
had
forfeited
his
right
to
be
there
had
cheated
her
of
the
complete
fulfilment
of
her
family
pride
deprived
her
of
the
rightful
pleasure
of
seeing
and
kissing
him
of
whom
she
had
been
so
proud
such
a
promising
young
fellow
the
thought
rankled
with
the
bitterness
of
a
injury
in
her
tenacious
old
heart
a
little
water
stood
in
her
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
of
the
finest
lawn
she
wiped
them
stealthily
well
aunt
ann
said
a
voice
behind
soames
forsyte
yet
with
something
round
and
secret
about
his
whole
appearance
looked
downwards
and
aslant
at
aunt
ann
as
though
trying
to
see
through
the
side
of
his
own
nose
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
engagement
he
asked
aunt
ann
eyes
rested
on
him
proudly
of
all
the
nephews
since
young
jolyon
departure
from
the
family
nest
he
was
now
her
favourite
for
she
recognised
in
him
a
sure
trustee
of
the
family
soul
that
must
so
soon
slip
beyond
her
keeping
very
nice
for
the
young
man
she
said
and
he
a
young
fellow
but
i
doubt
if
he
quite
the
right
lover
for
dear
soames
touched
the
edge
of
a
lustre
she
tame
him
he
said
stealthily
wetting
his
finger
and
rubbing
it
on
the
knobby
bulbs
that
genuine
old
lacquer
you
ca
get
it
nowadays
it
do
well
in
a
sale
at
he
spoke
with
relish
as
though
he
felt
that
he
was
cheering
up
his
old
aunt
it
was
seldom
he
was
so
confidential
i
would
mind
having
it
myself
he
added
you
can
always
get
your
price
for
old
you
so
clever
with
all
those
things
said
aunt
ann
and
how
is
dear
irene
soames
smile
died
pretty
well
he
said
complains
she
ca
sleep
she
sleeps
a
great
deal
better
than
i
do
and
he
looked
at
his
wife
who
was
talking
to
bosinney
by
the
door
aunt
ann
sighed
perhaps
she
said
it
will
be
just
as
well
for
her
not
to
see
so
much
of
june
she
such
a
decided
character
dear
june
soames
flushed
his
flushes
passed
rapidly
over
his
flat
cheeks
and
centered
between
his
eyes
where
they
remained
the
stamp
of
disturbing
thoughts
i
do
know
what
she
sees
in
that
little
flibbertigibbet
he
burst
out
but
noticing
that
they
were
no
longer
alone
he
turned
and
again
began
examining
the
lustre
they
tell
me
jolyon
bought
another
house
said
his
father
voice
close
by
he
must
have
a
lot
of
must
have
more
money
than
he
knows
what
to
do
with
montpellier
square
they
say
close
to
soames
they
never
told
me
irene
never
tells
me
anything
capital
position
not
two
minutes
from
me
said
the
voice
of
swithin
and
from
my
rooms
i
can
drive
to
the
club
in
the
position
of
their
houses
was
of
vital
importance
to
the
forsytes
nor
was
this
remarkable
since
the
whole
spirit
of
their
success
was
embodied
therein
their
father
of
farming
stock
had
come
from
dorsetshire
near
the
beginning
of
the
century
dosset
forsyte
as
he
was
called
by
his
intimates
had
been
a
stonemason
by
trade
and
risen
to
the
position
of
a
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
moved
to
london
where
building
on
until
he
died
he
was
buried
at
highgate
he
left
over
thirty
thousand
pounds
between
his
ten
children
old
jolyon
alluded
to
him
if
at
all
as
hard
thick
sort
of
man
not
much
refinement
about
him
the
second
generation
of
forsytes
felt
indeed
that
he
was
not
greatly
to
their
credit
the
only
aristocratic
trait
they
could
find
in
his
character
was
a
habit
of
drinking
madeira
aunt
hester
an
authority
on
family
history
described
him
thus
i
do
recollect
that
he
ever
did
anything
at
least
not
in
my
time
he
was
owner
of
houses
my
dear
his
hair
about
your
uncle
colour
rather
a
square
build
tall
very
tall
he
had
been
five
feet
five
with
a
mottled
face
a
man
i
remember
he
used
to
drink
madeira
but
ask
your
aunt
ann
what
was
his
father
to
do
with
the
land
down
in
dorsetshire
by
the
james
once
went
down
to
see
for
himself
what
sort
of
place
this
was
that
they
had
come
from
he
found
two
old
farms
with
a
cart
track
rutted
into
the
pink
earth
leading
down
to
a
mill
by
the
beach
a
little
grey
church
with
a
buttressed
outer
wall
and
a
smaller
and
greyer
chapel
the
stream
which
worked
the
mill
came
bubbling
down
in
a
dozen
rivulets
and
pigs
were
hunting
round
that
estuary
a
haze
hovered
over
the
prospect
down
this
hollow
with
their
feet
deep
in
the
mud
and
their
faces
towards
the
sea
it
appeared
that
the
primeval
forsytes
had
been
content
to
walk
sunday
after
sunday
for
hundreds
of
years
whether
or
no
james
had
cherished
hopes
of
an
inheritance
or
of
something
rather
distinguished
to
be
found
down
there
he
came
back
to
town
in
a
poor
way
and
went
about
with
a
pathetic
attempt
at
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
there
very
little
to
be
had
out
of
that
he
said
regular
country
little
place
old
as
the
hills
its
age
was
felt
to
be
a
comfort
old
jolyon
in
whom
a
desperate
honesty
welled
up
at
times
would
allude
to
his
ancestors
as
suppose
very
small
yet
he
would
repeat
the
word
as
if
it
afforded
him
consolation
they
had
all
done
so
well
for
themselves
these
forsytes
that
they
were
all
what
is
called
a
certain
position
they
had
shares
in
all
sorts
of
things
not
as
the
exception
of
consols
for
they
had
no
dread
in
life
like
that
of
per
cent
for
their
money
they
collected
pictures
too
and
were
supporters
of
such
charitable
institutions
as
might
be
beneficial
to
their
sick
domestics
from
their
father
the
builder
they
inherited
a
talent
for
bricks
and
mortar
originally
perhaps
members
of
some
primitive
sect
they
were
now
in
the
natural
course
of
things
members
of
the
church
of
england
and
caused
their
wives
and
children
to
attend
with
some
regularity
the
more
fashionable
churches
of
the
metropolis
to
have
doubted
their
christianity
would
have
caused
them
both
pain
and
surprise
some
of
them
paid
for
pews
thus
expressing
in
the
most
practical
form
their
sympathy
with
the
teachings
of
christ
their
residences
placed
at
stated
intervals
round
the
park
watched
like
sentinels
lest
the
fair
heart
of
this
london
where
their
desires
were
fixed
should
slip
from
their
clutches
and
leave
them
lower
in
their
own
estimations
there
was
old
jolyon
in
stanhope
place
the
jameses
in
park
lane
swithin
in
the
lonely
glory
of
orange
and
blue
chambers
in
hyde
park
had
never
married
not
soamses
in
their
nest
off
knightsbridge
the
rogers
in
prince
gardens
roger
was
that
remarkable
forsyte
who
had
conceived
and
carried
out
the
notion
of
bringing
up
his
four
sons
to
a
new
profession
collect
house
property
nothing
like
it
he
would
say
i
never
did
anything
else
the
haymans
hayman
was
the
one
married
forsyte
a
house
high
up
on
campden
hill
shaped
like
a
giraffe
and
so
tall
that
it
gave
the
observer
a
crick
in
the
neck
the
nicholases
in
ladbroke
grove
a
spacious
abode
and
a
great
bargain
and
last
but
not
least
timothy
on
the
bayswater
road
where
ann
and
juley
and
hester
lived
under
his
protection
but
all
this
time
james
was
musing
and
now
he
inquired
of
his
host
and
brother
what
he
had
given
for
that
house
in
montpellier
square
he
himself
had
had
his
eye
on
a
house
there
for
the
last
two
years
but
they
wanted
such
a
price
old
jolyon
recounted
the
details
of
his
purchase
years
to
run
repeated
james
the
very
house
i
was
given
too
much
for
it
old
jolyon
frowned
it
not
that
i
want
it
said
james
hastily
it
would
suit
my
purpose
at
that
price
soames
knows
the
house
tell
you
too
opinion
worth
i
do
said
old
jolyon
care
a
fig
for
his
well
murmured
james
you
will
have
your
own
a
good
opinion
we
going
to
drive
down
to
hurlingham
they
tell
me
going
to
wales
you
be
lonely
tomorrow
what
you
do
with
yourself
you
better
come
and
dine
with
us
old
jolyon
refused
he
went
down
to
the
front
door
and
saw
them
into
their
barouche
and
twinkled
at
them
having
already
forgotten
his
james
facing
the
horses
tall
and
majestic
with
auburn
hair
on
her
left
two
husbands
father
and
son
sitting
forward
as
though
they
expected
something
opposite
their
wives
bobbing
and
bounding
upon
the
spring
cushions
silent
swaying
to
each
motion
of
their
chariot
old
jolyon
watched
them
drive
away
under
the
sunlight
during
the
drive
the
silence
was
broken
by
james
did
you
ever
see
such
a
collection
of
people
soames
glancing
at
her
beneath
his
eyelids
nodded
and
he
saw
irene
steal
at
him
one
of
her
unfathomable
looks
it
is
likely
enough
that
each
branch
of
the
forsyte
family
made
that
remark
as
they
drove
away
from
old
jolyon
home
amongst
the
last
of
the
departing
guests
the
fourth
and
fifth
brothers
nicholas
and
roger
walked
away
together
directing
their
steps
alongside
hyde
park
towards
the
praed
street
station
of
the
underground
like
all
other
forsytes
of
a
certain
age
they
kept
carriages
of
their
own
and
never
took
cabs
if
by
any
means
they
could
avoid
it
the
day
was
bright
the
trees
of
the
park
in
the
full
beauty
of
foliage
the
brothers
did
not
seem
to
notice
phenomena
which
contributed
nevertheless
to
the
jauntiness
of
promenade
and
conversation
yes
said
roger
she
a
woman
that
wife
of
soames
i
told
they
do
get
this
brother
had
a
high
forehead
and
the
freshest
colour
of
any
of
the
forsytes
his
light
grey
eyes
measured
the
street
frontage
of
the
houses
by
the
way
and
now
and
then
he
would
level
his
umbrella
and
take
a
as
he
expressed
it
of
the
varying
heights
she
no
money
replied
nicholas
he
himself
had
married
a
good
deal
of
money
of
which
it
being
then
the
golden
age
before
the
married
women
property
act
he
had
mercifully
been
enabled
to
make
a
successful
use
what
was
her
father
heron
was
his
name
a
professor
so
they
tell
roger
shook
his
head
there
no
money
in
that
he
said
they
say
her
mother
father
was
roger
face
brightened
but
he
went
bankrupt
went
on
nicholas
ah
exclaimed
roger
soames
will
have
trouble
with
her
you
mark
my
words
he
have
got
a
foreign
nicholas
licked
his
lips
she
a
pretty
woman
and
he
waved
aside
a
how
did
he
get
hold
of
her
asked
roger
presently
she
must
cost
him
a
pretty
penny
in
dress
ann
tells
me
replied
nicholas
he
was
about
her
she
refused
him
five
times
james
he
nervous
about
it
i
can
ah
said
roger
again
i
sorry
for
james
he
had
trouble
with
his
pleasant
colour
was
heightened
by
exercise
he
swung
his
umbrella
to
the
level
of
his
eye
more
frequently
than
ever
face
also
wore
a
pleasant
look
too
pale
for
me
he
said
but
her
figures
capital
roger
made
no
reply
i
call
her
he
said
at
was
the
highest
praise
in
the
forsyte
vocabulary
that
young
bosinney
will
never
do
any
good
for
himself
they
say
at
burkitt
he
one
of
these
artistic
an
idea
of
improving
english
architecture
there
no
money
in
that
i
should
like
to
hear
what
timothy
would
say
to
they
entered
the
station
what
class
are
you
going
i
go
no
second
for
me
said
nicholas
you
never
know
what
you
may
he
took
a
ticket
to
notting
hill
gate
roger
a
second
to
south
kensington
the
train
coming
in
a
minute
later
the
two
brothers
parted
and
entered
their
respective
compartments
each
felt
aggrieved
that
the
other
had
not
modified
his
habits
to
secure
his
society
a
little
longer
but
as
roger
voiced
it
in
his
thoughts
a
stubborn
beggar
nick
and
as
nicholas
expressed
it
to
himself
chap
was
there
was
little
sentimentality
about
the
forsytes
in
that
great
london
which
they
had
conquered
and
become
merged
in
what
time
had
they
to
be
sentimental
chapter
jolyon
goes
to
the
opera
at
five
the
following
day
old
jolyon
sat
alone
a
cigar
between
his
lips
and
on
a
table
by
his
side
a
cup
of
tea
he
was
tired
and
before
he
had
finished
his
cigar
he
fell
asleep
a
fly
settled
on
his
hair
his
breathing
sounded
heavy
in
the
drowsy
silence
his
upper
lip
under
the
white
moustache
puffed
in
and
out
from
between
the
fingers
of
his
veined
and
wrinkled
hand
the
cigar
dropping
on
the
empty
hearth
burned
itself
out
the
gloomy
little
study
with
windows
of
stained
glass
to
exclude
the
view
was
full
of
dark
green
velvet
and
suite
of
which
old
jolyon
was
wont
to
say
wonder
if
it
made
a
big
price
some
day
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
in
the
after
life
he
could
get
more
for
things
than
he
had
given
in
the
rich
brown
atmosphere
peculiar
to
back
rooms
in
the
mansion
of
a
forsyte
the
rembrandtesque
effect
of
his
great
head
with
its
white
hair
against
the
cushion
of
his
seat
was
spoiled
by
the
moustache
which
imparted
a
somewhat
military
look
to
his
face
an
old
clock
that
had
been
with
him
since
before
his
marriage
forty
years
ago
kept
with
its
ticking
a
jealous
record
of
the
seconds
slipping
away
forever
from
its
old
master
he
had
never
cared
for
this
room
hardly
going
into
it
from
one
end
to
another
except
to
take
cigars
from
the
japanese
cabinet
in
the
corner
and
the
room
now
had
its
revenge
his
temples
curving
like
thatches
over
the
hollows
beneath
his
and
chin
all
were
sharpened
in
his
sleep
and
there
had
come
upon
his
face
the
confession
that
he
was
an
old
man
he
woke
june
had
gone
james
had
said
he
would
be
lonely
james
had
always
been
a
poor
thing
he
recollected
with
satisfaction
that
he
had
bought
that
house
over
james
head
serve
him
right
for
sticking
at
the
price
the
only
thing
the
fellow
thought
of
was
money
had
he
given
too
much
though
it
wanted
a
lot
of
doing
dared
say
he
would
want
all
his
money
before
he
had
done
with
this
affair
of
june
he
ought
never
to
have
allowed
the
engagement
she
had
met
this
bosinney
at
the
house
of
baynes
baynes
and
bildeboy
the
architects
he
believed
that
baynes
whom
he
bit
of
an
old
the
young
man
uncle
by
marriage
after
that
been
always
running
after
him
and
when
she
took
a
thing
into
her
head
there
was
no
stopping
her
she
was
continually
taking
up
with
ducks
of
one
sort
or
another
this
fellow
had
no
money
but
she
must
needs
become
engaged
to
harumscarum
unpractical
chap
who
would
get
himself
into
no
end
of
difficulties
she
had
come
to
him
one
day
in
her
way
and
told
him
and
as
if
it
were
any
consolation
she
had
added
he
so
splendid
he
often
lived
on
cocoa
for
a
week
and
he
wants
you
to
live
on
cocoa
too
oh
no
he
is
getting
into
the
swim
old
jolyon
had
taken
his
cigar
from
under
his
white
moustaches
stained
by
coffee
at
the
edge
and
looked
at
her
that
little
slip
of
a
thing
who
had
got
such
a
grip
of
his
heart
he
knew
more
about
than
his
granddaughter
but
she
having
clasped
her
hands
on
his
knees
rubbed
her
chin
against
him
making
a
sound
like
a
purring
cat
and
knocking
the
ash
off
his
cigar
he
had
exploded
in
nervous
desperation
you
all
alike
you
wo
be
satisfied
till
you
got
what
you
want
if
you
must
come
to
grief
you
must
i
wash
my
hands
of
so
he
had
washed
his
hands
of
it
making
the
condition
that
they
should
not
marry
until
bosinney
had
at
least
four
hundred
a
year
i
sha
be
able
to
give
you
very
much
he
had
said
a
formula
to
which
june
was
not
unaccustomed
perhaps
this
will
provide
the
he
had
hardly
seen
anything
of
her
since
it
began
a
bad
business
he
had
no
notion
of
giving
her
a
lot
of
money
to
enable
a
fellow
he
knew
nothing
about
to
live
on
in
idleness
he
had
seen
that
sort
of
thing
before
no
good
ever
came
of
it
worst
of
all
he
had
no
hope
of
shaking
her
resolution
she
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
always
had
been
from
a
child
he
did
see
where
it
was
to
end
they
must
cut
their
coat
according
to
their
cloth
he
would
not
give
way
till
he
saw
young
bosinney
with
an
income
of
his
own
that
june
would
have
trouble
with
the
fellow
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
he
had
no
more
idea
of
money
than
a
cow
as
to
this
rushing
down
to
wales
to
visit
the
young
aunts
he
fully
expected
they
were
old
cats
and
motionless
old
jolyon
stared
at
the
wall
but
for
his
open
eyes
he
might
have
been
asleep
the
idea
of
supposing
that
young
cub
soames
could
give
him
advice
he
had
always
been
a
cub
with
his
nose
in
the
air
he
would
be
setting
up
as
a
man
of
property
next
with
a
place
in
the
country
a
man
of
property
like
his
father
he
was
always
nosing
out
bargains
a
young
beggar
he
rose
and
going
to
the
cabinet
began
methodically
stocking
his
from
a
bundle
fresh
in
they
were
not
bad
at
the
price
but
you
could
get
a
good
cigar
nowadays
nothing
to
hold
a
candle
to
those
old
superfinos
of
hanson
and
bridger
that
was
a
cigar
the
thought
like
some
stealing
perfume
carried
him
back
to
those
wonderful
nights
at
richmond
when
after
dinner
he
sat
smoking
on
the
terrace
of
the
crown
and
sceptre
with
nicholas
treffry
and
traquair
and
jack
herring
and
anthony
thornworthy
how
good
his
cigars
were
then
poor
old
nick
and
jack
and
of
that
wife
of
his
and
shaky
no
wonder
with
his
appetite
of
all
the
company
of
those
days
he
himself
alone
seemed
left
except
swithin
of
course
and
he
so
outrageously
big
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
him
difficult
to
believe
it
was
so
long
ago
he
felt
young
still
of
all
his
thoughts
as
he
stood
there
counting
his
cigars
this
was
the
most
poignant
the
most
bitter
with
his
white
head
and
his
loneliness
he
had
remained
young
and
green
at
heart
and
those
sunday
afternoons
on
hampstead
heath
when
young
jolyon
and
he
went
for
a
stretch
along
the
spaniard
road
to
highgate
to
child
hill
and
back
over
the
heath
again
to
dine
at
jack
straw
delicious
his
cigars
were
then
and
such
weather
there
was
no
weather
now
when
june
was
a
toddler
of
five
and
every
other
sunday
he
took
her
to
the
zoo
away
from
the
society
of
those
two
good
women
her
mother
and
her
grandmother
and
at
the
top
of
the
bear
den
baited
his
umbrella
with
buns
for
her
favourite
bears
how
sweet
his
cigars
were
then
cigars
he
had
not
even
succeeded
in
his
famous
palate
that
in
the
fifties
men
swore
by
and
speaking
of
him
said
forsyte
the
best
palate
in
london
the
palate
that
in
a
sense
had
made
his
fortune
of
the
celebrated
tea
men
forsyte
and
treffry
whose
tea
like
no
other
man
tea
had
a
romantic
aroma
the
charm
of
a
quite
singular
genuineness
about
the
house
of
forsyte
and
treffry
in
the
city
had
clung
an
air
of
enterprise
and
mystery
of
special
dealings
in
special
ships
at
special
ports
with
special
orientals
he
had
worked
at
that
business
men
did
work
in
those
days
these
young
pups
hardly
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
he
had
gone
into
every
detail
known
everything
that
went
on
sometimes
sat
up
all
night
over
it
and
he
had
always
chosen
his
agents
himself
prided
himself
on
it
his
eye
for
men
he
used
to
say
had
been
the
secret
of
his
success
and
the
exercise
of
this
masterful
power
of
selection
had
been
the
only
part
of
it
all
that
he
had
really
liked
not
a
career
for
a
man
of
his
ability
even
now
when
the
business
had
been
turned
into
a
limited
liability
company
and
was
declining
he
had
got
out
of
his
shares
long
ago
he
felt
a
sharp
chagrin
in
thinking
of
that
time
how
much
better
he
might
have
done
he
would
have
succeeded
splendidly
at
the
bar
he
had
even
thought
of
standing
for
parliament
how
often
had
not
nicholas
treffry
said
to
him
you
could
do
anything
jo
if
you
were
so
careful
of
yourself
dear
old
nick
such
a
good
fellow
but
a
racketty
chap
the
notorious
treffry
he
had
never
taken
any
care
of
himself
so
he
was
dead
old
jolyon
counted
his
cigars
with
a
steady
hand
and
it
came
into
his
mind
to
wonder
if
perhaps
he
had
been
too
careful
of
himself
he
put
the
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
buttoned
it
in
and
walked
up
the
long
flights
to
his
bedroom
leaning
on
one
foot
and
the
other
and
helping
himself
by
the
bannister
the
house
was
too
big
after
june
was
married
if
she
ever
did
marry
this
fellow
as
he
supposed
she
would
he
would
let
it
and
go
into
rooms
what
was
the
use
of
keeping
half
a
dozen
servants
eating
their
heads
off
the
butler
came
to
the
ring
of
his
large
man
with
a
beard
a
soft
tread
and
a
peculiar
capacity
for
silence
old
jolyon
told
him
to
put
his
dress
clothes
out
he
was
going
to
dine
at
the
club
how
long
had
the
carriage
been
back
from
taking
miss
june
to
the
station
since
two
then
let
him
come
round
at
six
the
club
which
old
jolyon
entered
on
the
stroke
of
seven
was
one
of
those
political
institutions
of
the
upper
middle
class
which
have
seen
better
days
in
spite
of
being
talked
about
perhaps
in
consequence
of
being
talked
about
it
betrayed
a
disappointing
vitality
people
had
grown
tired
of
saying
that
the
was
on
its
last
legs
old
jolyon
would
say
it
too
yet
disregarded
the
fact
in
a
manner
truly
irritating
to
clubmen
why
do
you
keep
your
name
on
swithin
often
asked
him
with
profound
vexation
why
do
you
join
the
you
ca
get
a
wine
like
our
heidsieck
under
twenty
shillin
a
bottle
anywhere
in
london
and
dropping
his
voice
he
added
there
only
five
hundred
dozen
left
i
drink
it
every
night
of
my
i
think
of
it
old
jolyon
would
answer
but
when
he
did
think
of
it
there
was
always
the
question
of
fifty
guineas
entrance
fee
and
it
would
take
him
four
or
five
years
to
get
in
he
continued
to
think
of
it
he
was
too
old
to
be
a
liberal
had
long
ceased
to
believe
in
the
political
doctrines
of
his
club
had
even
been
known
to
allude
to
them
as
stuff
and
it
afforded
him
pleasure
to
continue
a
member
in
the
teeth
of
principles
so
opposed
to
his
own
he
had
always
had
a
contempt
for
the
place
having
joined
it
many
years
ago
when
they
refused
to
have
him
at
the
potch
owing
to
his
being
trade
as
if
he
were
not
as
good
as
any
of
them
he
naturally
despised
the
club
that
did
take
him
the
members
were
a
poor
lot
many
of
them
in
the
solicitors
not
like
most
men
of
strong
character
but
not
too
much
originality
old
jolyon
set
small
store
by
the
class
to
which
he
belonged
faithfully
he
followed
their
customs
social
and
otherwise
and
secretly
he
thought
them
common
lot
years
and
philosophy
of
which
he
had
his
share
had
dimmed
the
recollection
of
his
defeat
at
the
potch
and
now
in
his
thoughts
it
was
enshrined
as
the
queen
of
clubs
he
would
have
been
a
member
all
these
years
himself
but
owing
to
the
slipshod
way
his
proposer
jack
herring
had
gone
to
work
they
had
not
known
what
they
were
doing
in
keeping
him
out
why
they
had
taken
his
son
jo
at
once
and
he
believed
the
boy
was
still
a
member
he
had
received
a
letter
dated
from
there
eight
years
ago
he
had
not
been
near
the
for
months
and
the
house
had
undergone
the
piebald
decoration
which
people
bestow
on
old
houses
and
old
ships
when
anxious
to
sell
them
colour
the
he
thought
is
good
its
gloomy
chocolate
picked
out
with
light
green
took
his
fancy
he
ordered
dinner
and
sat
down
in
the
very
corner
at
the
very
table
perhaps
things
did
not
progress
much
at
the
a
club
of
almost
radical
principles
at
which
he
and
young
jolyon
used
to
sit
years
ago
when
he
was
taking
the
latter
to
drury
lane
during
his
holidays
the
boy
had
loved
the
theatre
and
old
jolyon
recalled
how
he
used
to
sit
opposite
concealing
his
excitement
under
a
careful
but
transparent
nonchalance
he
ordered
himself
too
the
very
dinner
the
boy
had
always
whitebait
cutlets
and
a
tart
ah
if
he
were
only
opposite
now
the
two
had
not
met
for
fourteen
years
and
not
for
the
first
time
during
those
fourteen
years
old
jolyon
wondered
whether
he
had
been
a
little
to
blame
in
the
matter
of
his
son
an
unfortunate
with
that
precious
flirt
danae
thornworthy
now
danae
pellew
anthony
thornworthy
daughter
had
thrown
him
on
the
rebound
into
the
arms
of
june
mother
he
ought
perhaps
to
have
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
of
their
marriage
they
were
too
young
but
after
that
experience
of
susceptibility
he
had
been
only
too
anxious
to
see
him
married
and
in
four
years
the
crash
had
come
to
have
approved
his
son
conduct
in
that
crash
was
of
course
impossible
reason
and
combination
of
potent
factors
which
stood
for
his
him
of
this
impossibility
and
his
heart
cried
out
the
grim
remorselessness
of
that
business
had
no
pity
for
hearts
there
was
june
the
atom
with
flaming
hair
who
had
climbed
all
over
him
twined
and
twisted
herself
about
his
heart
that
was
made
to
be
the
plaything
and
beloved
resort
of
tiny
helpless
things
with
characteristic
insight
he
saw
he
must
part
with
one
or
with
the
other
no
could
serve
in
such
a
situation
in
that
lay
its
tragedy
and
the
tiny
helpless
thing
prevailed
he
would
not
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
and
so
to
his
son
he
said
that
had
lasted
until
now
he
had
proposed
to
continue
a
reduced
allowance
to
young
jolyon
but
this
had
been
refused
and
perhaps
that
refusal
had
hurt
him
more
than
anything
for
with
it
had
gone
the
last
outlet
of
his
affection
and
there
had
come
such
tangible
and
solid
proof
of
rupture
as
only
a
transaction
in
property
a
bestowal
or
refusal
of
such
could
supply
his
dinner
tasted
flat
his
pint
of
champagne
was
dry
and
bitter
stuff
not
like
the
veuve
clicquots
of
old
days
over
his
cup
of
coffee
he
bethought
him
that
he
would
go
to
the
opera
in
the
times
had
a
distrust
of
other
read
the
announcement
for
the
evening
it
was
mercifully
not
one
of
those
german
pantomimes
by
that
fellow
wagner
putting
on
his
ancient
opera
hat
which
with
its
brim
flattened
by
use
and
huge
capacity
looked
like
an
emblem
of
greater
days
and
pulling
out
an
old
pair
of
very
thin
lavender
kid
gloves
smelling
strongly
of
russia
leather
from
habitual
proximity
to
the
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
he
stepped
into
a
hansom
the
cab
rattled
gaily
along
the
streets
and
old
jolyon
was
struck
by
their
unwonted
animation
hotels
must
be
doing
a
tremendous
business
he
thought
a
few
years
ago
there
had
been
none
of
these
big
hotels
he
made
a
satisfactory
reflection
on
some
property
he
had
in
the
neighbourhood
it
must
be
going
up
in
value
by
leaps
and
bounds
what
traffic
but
from
that
he
began
indulging
in
one
of
those
strange
impersonal
speculations
so
uncharacteristic
of
a
forsyte
wherein
lay
in
part
the
secret
of
his
supremacy
amongst
them
what
atoms
men
were
and
what
a
lot
of
them
and
what
would
become
of
them
all
he
stumbled
as
he
got
out
of
the
cab
gave
the
man
his
exact
fare
walked
up
to
the
ticket
office
to
take
his
stall
and
stood
there
with
his
purse
in
his
always
carried
his
money
in
a
purse
never
having
approved
of
that
habit
of
carrying
it
loosely
in
the
pockets
as
so
many
young
men
did
nowadays
the
official
leaned
out
like
an
old
dog
from
a
kennel
why
he
said
in
a
surprised
voice
it
jolyon
forsyte
so
it
is
have
seen
you
sir
for
years
dear
me
times
are
what
they
were
why
you
and
your
brother
and
that
traquair
and
nicholas
used
to
have
six
or
seven
stalls
here
regular
every
season
and
how
are
you
sir
we
do
get
younger
the
colour
in
old
jolyon
eyes
deepened
he
paid
his
guinea
they
had
not
forgotten
him
he
marched
in
to
the
sounds
of
the
overture
like
an
old
to
battle
folding
his
opera
hat
he
sat
down
drew
out
his
lavender
gloves
in
the
old
way
and
took
up
his
glasses
for
a
long
look
round
the
house
dropping
them
at
last
on
his
folded
hat
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
curtain
more
poignantly
than
ever
he
felt
that
it
was
all
over
and
done
with
him
where
were
all
the
women
the
pretty
women
the
house
used
to
be
so
full
of
where
was
that
old
feeling
in
the
heart
as
he
waited
for
one
of
those
great
singers
where
that
sensation
of
the
intoxication
of
life
and
of
his
own
power
to
enjoy
it
all
the
greatest
of
his
day
there
was
no
opera
now
that
fellow
wagner
had
ruined
everything
no
melody
left
nor
any
voices
to
sing
it
ah
the
wonderful
singers
gone
he
sat
watching
the
old
scenes
acted
a
numb
feeling
at
his
heart
from
the
curl
of
silver
over
his
ear
to
the
pose
of
his
foot
in
its
patent
boot
there
was
nothing
clumsy
or
weak
about
old
jolyon
he
was
as
in
those
old
times
when
he
came
every
night
his
sight
was
as
as
good
but
what
a
feeling
of
weariness
and
disillusion
he
had
been
in
the
habit
all
his
life
of
enjoying
things
even
imperfect
there
had
been
many
imperfect
had
enjoyed
them
all
with
moderation
so
as
to
keep
himself
young
but
now
he
was
deserted
by
his
power
of
enjoyment
by
his
philosophy
and
left
with
this
dreadful
feeling
that
it
was
all
done
with
not
even
the
prisoners
chorus
nor
florian
song
had
the
power
to
dispel
the
gloom
of
his
loneliness
if
jo
were
only
with
him
the
boy
must
be
forty
by
now
he
had
wasted
fourteen
years
out
of
the
life
of
his
only
son
and
jo
was
no
longer
a
social
pariah
he
was
married
old
jolyon
had
been
unable
to
refrain
from
marking
his
appreciation
of
the
action
by
enclosing
his
son
a
cheque
for
the
cheque
had
been
returned
in
a
letter
from
the
potch
couched
in
these
words
dearest
father
generous
gift
was
welcome
as
a
sign
that
you
might
think
worse
of
me
i
return
it
but
should
you
think
fit
to
invest
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
chap
we
call
him
jolly
who
bears
our
christian
and
by
courtesy
our
surname
i
shall
be
very
glad
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
your
health
is
as
good
as
ever
loving
son
the
letter
was
like
the
boy
he
had
always
been
an
amiable
chap
old
jolyon
had
sent
this
reply
dear
jo
sum
stands
in
my
books
for
the
benefit
of
your
boy
under
the
name
of
jolyon
forsyte
and
will
be
with
interest
at
per
cent
i
hope
that
you
are
doing
well
my
health
remains
good
at
present
love
i
am
affectionate
father
forsyte
and
every
year
on
the
of
january
he
had
added
a
hundred
and
the
interest
the
sum
was
mounting
new
year
day
it
would
be
fifteen
hundred
and
odd
pounds
and
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
much
satisfaction
he
had
got
out
of
that
yearly
transaction
but
the
correspondence
had
ended
in
spite
of
his
love
for
his
son
in
spite
of
an
instinct
partly
constitutional
partly
the
result
as
in
thousands
of
his
class
of
the
continual
handling
and
watching
of
affairs
prompting
him
to
judge
conduct
by
results
rather
than
by
principle
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
a
sort
of
uneasiness
his
son
ought
under
the
circumstances
to
have
gone
to
the
dogs
that
law
was
laid
down
in
all
the
novels
sermons
and
plays
he
had
ever
read
heard
or
witnessed
after
receiving
the
cheque
back
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
something
wrong
somewhere
why
had
his
son
not
gone
to
the
dogs
but
then
who
could
tell
he
had
heard
of
fact
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
find
jo
lived
in
john
wood
that
he
had
a
little
house
in
wistaria
avenue
with
a
garden
and
took
his
wife
about
with
him
into
queer
sort
of
society
no
that
they
had
two
little
chap
they
called
jolly
considering
the
circumstances
the
name
struck
him
as
cynical
and
old
jolyon
both
feared
and
disliked
cynicism
and
a
girl
called
holly
born
since
the
marriage
who
could
tell
what
his
son
circumstances
really
were
he
had
capitalized
the
income
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
father
and
joined
lloyd
as
an
underwriter
he
painted
pictures
old
jolyon
knew
this
for
he
had
surreptitiously
bought
them
from
time
to
time
after
chancing
to
see
his
son
name
signed
at
the
bottom
of
a
representation
of
the
river
thames
in
a
dealer
window
he
thought
them
bad
and
did
not
hang
them
because
of
the
signature
he
kept
them
locked
up
in
a
drawer
in
the
great
a
terrible
yearning
came
on
him
to
see
his
son
he
remembered
the
days
when
he
had
been
wont
to
slide
him
in
a
brown
holland
suit
to
and
fro
under
the
arch
of
his
legs
the
times
when
he
ran
beside
the
boy
pony
teaching
him
to
ride
the
day
he
first
took
him
to
school
he
had
been
a
loving
lovable
little
chap
after
he
went
to
eton
he
had
acquired
perhaps
a
little
too
much
of
that
desirable
manner
which
old
jolyon
knew
was
only
to
be
obtained
at
such
places
and
at
great
expense
but
he
had
always
been
companionable
always
a
companion
even
after
little
far
off
perhaps
owing
to
the
advantages
he
had
received
old
jolyon
feeling
towards
our
public
schools
and
never
wavered
and
he
retained
touchingly
his
attitude
of
admiration
and
mistrust
towards
a
system
appropriate
to
the
highest
in
the
land
of
which
he
had
not
himself
been
privileged
to
partake
now
that
june
had
gone
and
left
or
as
good
as
left
him
it
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
see
his
son
again
guilty
of
this
treason
to
his
family
his
principles
his
class
old
jolyon
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
singer
a
poor
wretched
poor
thing
and
the
florian
a
perfect
stick
it
was
over
they
were
easily
pleased
nowadays
in
the
crowded
street
he
snapped
up
a
cab
under
the
very
nose
of
a
stout
and
much
younger
gentleman
who
had
already
assumed
it
to
be
his
own
his
route
lay
through
pall
mall
and
at
the
corner
instead
of
going
through
the
green
park
the
cabman
turned
to
drive
up
street
old
jolyon
put
his
hand
through
the
trap
he
could
not
bear
being
taken
out
of
his
way
in
turning
however
he
found
himself
opposite
the
potch
and
the
yearning
that
had
been
secretly
with
him
the
whole
evening
prevailed
he
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
he
would
go
in
and
ask
if
jo
still
belonged
there
he
went
in
the
hall
looked
exactly
as
it
did
when
he
used
to
dine
there
with
jack
herring
and
they
had
the
best
cook
in
london
and
he
looked
round
with
the
shrewd
straight
glance
that
had
caused
him
all
his
life
to
be
better
served
than
most
men
mr
jolyon
forsyte
still
a
member
here
yes
sir
in
the
club
now
sir
what
name
old
jolyon
was
taken
aback
his
father
he
said
and
having
spoken
he
took
his
stand
back
to
the
fireplace
young
jolyon
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
club
had
put
on
his
hat
and
was
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
hall
as
the
porter
met
him
he
was
no
longer
young
with
hair
going
grey
and
narrower
replica
of
his
father
with
the
same
large
drooping
worn
he
turned
pale
this
meeting
was
terrible
after
all
those
years
for
nothing
in
the
world
was
so
terrible
as
a
scene
they
met
and
crossed
hands
without
a
word
then
with
a
quaver
in
his
voice
the
father
said
how
are
you
my
boy
the
son
answered
how
are
you
dad
old
jolyon
hand
trembled
in
its
thin
lavender
glove
if
you
going
my
way
he
said
i
can
give
you
a
and
as
though
in
the
habit
of
taking
each
other
home
every
night
they
went
out
and
stepped
into
the
cab
to
old
jolyon
it
seemed
that
his
son
had
grown
of
a
man
altogether
was
his
comment
over
the
natural
amiability
of
that
face
had
come
a
rather
sardonic
mask
as
though
he
had
found
in
the
circumstances
of
his
life
the
necessity
for
armour
the
features
were
certainly
those
of
a
forsyte
but
the
expression
was
more
the
introspective
look
of
a
student
or
philosopher
he
had
no
doubt
been
obliged
to
look
into
himself
a
good
deal
in
the
course
of
those
fifteen
years
to
young
jolyon
the
first
sight
of
his
father
was
undoubtedly
a
looked
so
worn
and
old
but
in
the
cab
he
seemed
hardly
to
have
changed
still
having
the
calm
look
so
well
remembered
still
being
upright
and
you
look
well
middling
old
jolyon
answered
he
was
the
prey
of
an
anxiety
that
he
found
he
must
put
into
words
having
got
his
son
back
like
this
he
felt
he
must
know
what
was
his
financial
position
jo
he
said
i
should
like
to
hear
what
sort
of
water
you
in
i
suppose
you
in
debt
he
put
it
this
way
that
his
son
might
find
it
easier
to
confess
young
jolyon
answered
in
his
ironical
voice
no
i
not
in
debt
old
jolyon
saw
that
he
was
angry
and
touched
his
hand
he
had
run
a
risk
it
was
worth
it
however
and
jo
had
never
been
sulky
with
him
they
drove
on
without
speaking
again
to
stanhope
gate
old
jolyon
invited
him
in
but
young
jolyon
shook
his
head
june
not
here
said
his
father
hastily
went
of
on
a
visit
i
suppose
you
know
that
she
engaged
to
be
married
already
murmured
young
jolyon
old
jolyon
stepped
out
and
in
paying
the
cab
fare
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
gave
the
driver
a
sovereign
in
mistake
for
a
shilling
placing
the
coin
in
his
mouth
the
cabman
whipped
his
horse
secretly
on
the
underneath
and
hurried
away
old
jolyon
turned
the
key
softly
in
the
lock
pushed
open
the
door
and
beckoned
his
son
saw
him
gravely
hanging
up
his
coat
with
an
expression
on
his
face
like
that
of
a
boy
who
intends
to
steal
cherries
the
door
of
the
was
open
the
gas
turned
low
a
hissed
on
a
and
close
to
it
a
cynical
looking
cat
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
old
jolyon
her
off
at
once
the
incident
was
a
relief
to
his
feelings
he
rattled
his
opera
hat
behind
the
animal
she
got
fleas
he
said
following
her
out
of
the
room
through
the
door
in
the
hall
leading
to
the
basement
he
called
hssst
several
times
as
though
assisting
the
cat
departure
till
by
some
strange
coincidence
the
butler
appeared
below
you
can
go
to
bed
parfitt
said
old
jolyon
i
will
lock
up
and
put
when
he
again
entered
the
the
cat
unfortunately
preceded
him
with
her
tail
in
the
air
proclaiming
that
she
had
seen
through
this
manouevre
for
suppressing
the
butler
from
the
first
a
fatality
had
dogged
old
jolyon
domestic
stratagems
all
his
life
young
jolyon
could
not
help
smiling
he
was
very
well
versed
in
irony
and
everything
that
evening
seemed
to
him
ironical
the
episode
of
the
cat
the
announcement
of
his
own
daughter
engagement
so
he
had
no
more
part
or
parcel
in
her
than
he
had
in
the
puss
and
the
poetical
justice
of
this
appealed
to
him
what
is
june
like
now
he
asked
she
a
little
thing
returned
old
jolyon
they
say
she
like
me
but
that
their
folly
she
more
like
your
same
eyes
and
ah
and
she
is
pretty
old
jolyon
was
too
much
of
a
forsyte
to
praise
anything
freely
especially
anything
for
which
he
had
a
genuine
admiration
not
bad
regular
forsyte
chin
it
be
lonely
here
when
gone
the
look
on
his
face
again
gave
young
jolyon
the
shock
he
had
felt
on
first
seeing
his
father
what
will
you
do
with
yourself
dad
i
suppose
she
wrapped
up
in
him
do
with
myself
repeated
old
jolyon
with
an
angry
break
in
his
voice
it
be
miserable
work
living
here
alone
i
do
know
how
to
end
i
wish
to
goodness
he
checked
himself
and
added
the
question
is
what
had
i
better
do
with
this
house
young
jolyon
looked
round
the
room
it
was
peculiarly
vast
and
dreary
decorated
with
the
enormous
pictures
of
still
life
that
he
remembered
as
a
dogs
with
their
noses
resting
on
bunches
of
carrots
together
with
onions
and
grapes
lying
side
by
side
in
mild
surprise
the
house
was
a
white
elephant
but
he
could
not
conceive
of
his
father
living
in
a
smaller
place
and
all
the
more
did
it
all
seem
ironical
in
his
great
chair
with
the
sat
old
jolyon
the
figurehead
of
his
family
and
class
and
creed
with
his
white
head
and
forehead
the
representative
of
moderation
and
order
and
love
of
property
as
lonely
an
old
man
as
there
was
in
london
there
he
sat
in
the
gloomy
comfort
of
the
room
a
puppet
in
the
power
of
great
forces
that
cared
nothing
for
family
or
class
or
creed
but
moved
with
dread
processes
to
inscrutable
ends
this
was
how
it
struck
young
jolyon
who
had
the
impersonal
eye
the
poor
old
dad
so
this
was
the
end
the
purpose
to
which
he
had
lived
with
such
magnificent
moderation
to
be
lonely
and
grow
older
and
older
yearning
for
a
soul
to
speak
to
in
his
turn
old
jolyon
looked
back
at
his
son
he
wanted
to
talk
about
many
things
that
he
had
been
unable
to
talk
about
all
these
years
it
had
been
impossible
to
seriously
confide
in
june
his
conviction
that
property
in
the
soho
quarter
would
go
up
in
value
his
uneasiness
about
that
tremendous
silence
of
pippin
the
superintendent
of
the
new
colliery
company
of
which
he
had
so
long
been
chairman
his
disgust
at
the
steady
fall
in
american
golgothas
or
even
to
discuss
how
by
some
sort
of
settlement
he
could
best
avoid
the
payment
of
those
death
duties
which
would
follow
his
decease
under
the
influence
however
of
a
cup
of
tea
which
he
seemed
to
stir
indefinitely
he
began
to
speak
at
last
a
new
vista
of
life
was
thus
opened
up
a
promised
land
of
talk
where
he
could
find
a
harbour
against
the
waves
of
anticipation
and
regret
where
he
could
soothe
his
soul
with
the
opium
of
devising
how
to
round
off
his
property
and
make
eternal
the
only
part
of
him
that
was
to
remain
alive
young
jolyon
was
a
good
listener
it
was
his
great
quality
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
father
face
putting
a
question
now
and
then
the
clock
struck
one
before
old
jolyon
had
finished
and
at
the
sound
of
its
striking
his
principles
came
back
he
took
out
his
watch
with
a
look
of
surprise
i
must
go
to
bed
jo
he
said
young
jolyon
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
to
help
his
father
up
the
old
face
looked
worn
and
hollow
again
the
eyes
were
steadily
averted
my
boy
take
care
of
a
moment
passed
and
young
jolyon
turning
on
his
heel
marched
out
at
the
door
he
could
hardly
see
his
smile
quavered
never
in
all
the
fifteen
years
since
he
had
first
found
out
that
life
was
no
simple
business
had
he
found
it
so
singularly
complicated
chapter
at
in
swithin
orange
and
facing
the
park
the
round
table
was
laid
for
twelve
a
chandelier
filled
with
lighted
candles
hung
like
a
giant
stalactite
above
its
centre
radiating
over
large
mirrors
slabs
of
marble
on
the
tops
of
and
heavy
gold
chairs
with
crewel
worked
seats
everything
betokened
that
love
of
beauty
so
deeply
implanted
in
each
family
which
has
had
its
own
way
to
make
into
society
out
of
the
more
vulgar
heart
of
nature
swithin
had
indeed
an
impatience
of
simplicity
a
love
of
ormolu
which
had
always
stamped
him
amongst
his
associates
as
a
man
of
great
if
somewhat
luxurious
taste
and
out
of
the
knowledge
that
no
one
could
possibly
enter
his
rooms
without
perceiving
him
to
be
a
man
of
wealth
he
had
derived
a
solid
and
prolonged
happiness
such
as
perhaps
no
other
circumstance
in
life
had
afforded
him
since
his
retirement
from
land
agency
a
profession
deplorable
in
his
estimation
especially
as
to
its
auctioneering
department
he
had
abandoned
himself
to
naturally
aristocratic
tastes
the
perfect
luxury
of
his
latter
days
had
embedded
him
like
a
fly
in
sugar
and
his
mind
where
very
little
took
place
from
morning
till
night
was
the
junction
of
two
curiously
opposite
emotions
a
lingering
and
sturdy
satisfaction
that
he
had
made
his
own
way
and
his
own
fortune
and
a
sense
that
a
man
of
his
distinction
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
soil
his
mind
with
work
he
stood
at
the
sideboard
in
a
white
waistcoat
with
large
gold
and
onyx
buttons
watching
his
valet
screw
the
necks
of
three
champagne
bottles
deeper
into
between
the
points
of
his
collar
it
hurt
him
to
would
on
no
account
have
had
altered
the
pale
flesh
of
his
under
chin
remained
immovable
his
eyes
roved
from
bottle
to
bottle
he
was
debating
and
he
argued
like
this
jolyon
drinks
a
glass
perhaps
two
he
so
careful
of
himself
james
he
ca
take
his
wine
nowadays
and
he
would
swill
water
he
should
wonder
soames
did
count
these
young
was
drink
but
bosinney
encountering
in
the
name
of
this
stranger
something
outside
the
range
of
his
philosophy
swithin
paused
a
misgiving
arose
within
him
it
was
impossible
to
tell
june
was
only
a
girl
in
love
too
emily
james
liked
a
good
glass
of
champagne
it
was
too
dry
for
juley
poor
old
soul
she
had
no
palate
as
to
hatty
chessman
the
thought
of
this
old
friend
caused
a
cloud
of
thought
to
obscure
the
perfect
glassiness
of
his
eyes
he
should
wonder
if
she
drank
half
a
bottle
but
in
thinking
of
his
remaining
guest
an
expression
like
that
of
a
cat
who
is
just
going
to
purr
stole
over
his
old
face
soames
she
might
take
much
but
she
would
appreciate
what
she
drank
it
was
a
pleasure
to
give
her
good
wine
a
pretty
sympathetic
to
him
the
thought
of
her
was
like
champagne
itself
a
pleasure
to
give
a
good
wine
to
a
young
woman
who
looked
so
well
who
knew
how
to
dress
with
charming
manners
quite
pleasure
to
entertain
her
between
the
points
of
his
collar
he
gave
his
head
the
first
small
painful
oscillation
of
the
evening
adolf
he
said
put
in
another
he
himself
might
drink
a
good
deal
for
thanks
to
that
prescription
of
blight
he
found
himself
extremely
well
and
he
had
been
careful
to
take
no
lunch
he
had
not
felt
so
well
for
weeks
puffing
out
his
lower
lip
he
gave
his
last
instructions
adolf
the
least
touch
of
the
west
india
when
you
come
to
the
passing
into
the
anteroom
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
with
his
knees
apart
and
his
tall
bulky
form
was
wrapped
at
once
in
an
expectant
strange
primeval
immobility
he
was
ready
to
rise
at
a
moment
notice
he
had
not
given
a
for
months
this
dinner
in
honour
of
june
engagement
had
seemed
a
bore
at
first
among
forsytes
the
custom
of
solemnizing
engagements
by
feasts
was
religiously
observed
but
the
labours
of
sending
invitations
and
ordering
the
repast
over
he
felt
pleasantly
stimulated
and
thus
sitting
a
watch
in
his
hand
fat
and
smooth
and
golden
like
a
flattened
globe
of
butter
he
thought
of
nothing
a
long
man
with
side
whiskers
who
had
once
been
in
swithin
service
but
was
now
a
greengrocer
entered
and
proclaimed
mrs
chessman
septimus
small
two
ladies
advanced
the
one
in
front
habited
entirely
in
red
had
large
settled
patches
of
the
same
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
a
hard
dashing
eye
she
walked
at
swithin
holding
out
a
hand
cased
in
a
long
glove
well
swithin
she
said
i
have
seen
you
for
ages
how
are
you
why
my
dear
boy
how
stout
you
getting
the
fixity
of
swithin
eye
alone
betrayed
emotion
a
dumb
and
grumbling
anger
swelled
his
bosom
it
was
vulgar
to
be
stout
to
talk
of
being
stout
he
had
a
chest
nothing
more
turning
to
his
sister
he
grasped
her
hand
and
said
in
a
tone
of
command
well
septimus
small
was
the
tallest
of
the
four
sisters
her
good
round
old
face
had
gone
a
little
sour
an
innumerable
pout
clung
all
over
it
as
if
it
had
been
encased
in
an
iron
wire
mask
up
to
that
evening
which
being
suddenly
removed
left
little
rolls
of
mutinous
flesh
all
over
her
countenance
even
her
eyes
were
pouting
it
was
thus
that
she
recorded
her
permanent
resentment
at
the
loss
of
septimus
small
she
had
quite
a
reputation
for
saying
the
wrong
thing
and
tenacious
like
all
her
breed
she
would
hold
to
it
when
she
had
said
it
and
add
to
it
another
wrong
thing
and
so
on
with
the
decease
of
her
husband
the
family
tenacity
the
family
had
gone
sterile
within
her
a
great
talker
when
allowed
she
would
converse
without
the
faintest
animation
for
hours
together
relating
with
epic
monotony
the
innumerable
occasions
on
which
fortune
had
misused
her
nor
did
she
ever
perceive
that
her
hearers
sympathized
with
fortune
for
her
heart
was
kind
having
sat
poor
soul
long
by
the
bedside
of
small
a
man
of
poor
constitution
she
had
acquired
the
habit
and
there
were
countless
subsequent
occasions
when
she
had
sat
immense
periods
of
time
to
amuse
sick
people
children
and
other
helpless
persons
and
she
could
never
divest
herself
of
the
feeling
that
the
world
was
the
most
ungrateful
place
anybody
could
live
in
sunday
after
sunday
she
sat
at
the
feet
of
that
extremely
witty
preacher
the
rev
thomas
scoles
who
exercised
a
great
influence
over
her
but
she
succeeded
in
convincing
everybody
that
even
this
was
a
misfortune
she
had
passed
into
a
proverb
in
the
family
and
when
anybody
was
observed
to
be
peculiarly
distressing
he
was
known
as
a
regular
the
habit
of
her
mind
would
have
killed
anybody
but
a
forsyte
at
forty
but
she
was
and
had
never
looked
better
and
one
felt
that
there
were
capacities
for
enjoyment
about
her
which
might
yet
come
out
she
owned
three
canaries
the
cat
tommy
and
half
a
common
with
her
sister
hester
these
poor
creatures
kept
carefully
out
of
timothy
was
nervous
about
animals
unlike
human
beings
recognising
that
she
could
not
help
being
blighted
attached
themselves
to
her
passionately
she
was
sombrely
magnificent
this
evening
in
black
bombazine
with
a
mauve
front
cut
in
a
shy
triangle
and
crowned
with
a
black
velvet
ribbon
round
the
base
of
her
thin
throat
black
and
mauve
for
evening
wear
was
esteemed
very
chaste
by
nearly
every
forsyte
pouting
at
swithin
she
said
ann
has
been
asking
for
you
you
have
been
near
us
for
an
age
swithin
put
his
thumbs
within
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
and
replied
ann
getting
very
shaky
she
ought
to
have
a
doctor
mr
and
nicholas
forsyte
nicholas
forsyte
cocking
his
rectangular
eyebrows
wore
a
smile
he
had
succeeded
during
the
day
in
bringing
to
fruition
a
scheme
for
the
employment
of
a
tribe
from
upper
india
in
the
of
ceylon
a
pet
plan
carried
at
last
in
the
teeth
of
great
was
justly
pleased
it
would
double
the
output
of
his
mines
and
as
he
had
often
forcibly
argued
all
experience
tended
to
show
that
a
man
must
die
and
whether
he
died
of
a
miserable
old
age
in
his
own
country
or
prematurely
of
damp
in
the
bottom
of
a
foreign
mine
was
surely
of
little
consequence
provided
that
by
a
change
in
his
mode
of
life
he
benefited
the
british
empire
his
ability
was
undoubted
raising
his
broken
nose
towards
his
listener
he
would
add
for
want
of
a
few
hundred
of
these
fellows
we
have
paid
a
dividend
for
years
and
look
at
the
price
of
the
shares
i
ca
get
ten
shillings
for
he
had
been
at
yarmouth
too
and
had
come
back
feeling
that
he
had
added
at
least
ten
years
to
his
own
life
he
grasped
swithin
hand
exclaiming
in
a
jocular
voice
well
so
here
we
are
again
nicholas

effete
woman
smiled
a
smile
of
frightened
jollity
behind
his
back

how
are
you

how
do
you
do
his
hand
enclosed
irene
and
his
eyes
swelled
she
was
a
pretty
little
too
pale
but
her
figure
her
eyes
her
teeth
too
good
for
that
chap
soames
the
gods
had
given
irene
dark
brown
eyes
and
golden
hair
that
strange
combination
provocative
of
men
glances
which
is
said
to
be
the
mark
of
a
weak
character
and
the
full
soft
pallor
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
above
a
frock
gave
to
her
personality
an
alluring
strangeness
soames
stood
behind
his
eyes
fastened
on
his
wife
neck
the
hands
of
swithin

which
he
still
held
open
in
his
hand
had
left
eight
behind
it
was
half
an
hour
beyond
his
had
had
no
a
strange
primeval
impatience
surged
up
within
him
it
not
like
jolyon
to
be
late
he
said
to
irene
with
uncontrollable
vexation
i
suppose
it
be
june
keeping
him
people
in
love
are
always
late
she
answered
swithin
stared
at
her
a
dusky
orange
dyed
his
cheeks
they
no
business
to
be
some
fashionable
nonsense
and
behind
this
outburst
the
inarticulate
violence
of
primitive
generations
seemed
to
mutter
and
grumble
tell
me
what
you
think
of
my
new
star
uncle
swithin
said
irene
softly
among
the
lace
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
was
shining
a
star
made
of
eleven
diamonds
swithin
looked
at
the
star
he
had
a
pretty
taste
in
stones
no
question
could
have
been
more
sympathetically
devised
to
distract
his
attention
who
gave
you
that
he
asked
there
was
no
change
in
her
face
but
swithin
pale
eyes
bulged
as
though
he
might
suddenly
have
been
afflicted
with
insight
i
dare
say
you
dull
at
home
he
said
any
day
you
like
to
come
and
dine
with
me
i
give
you
as
good
a
bottle
of
wine
as
you

in

mr
boswainey
swithin
moved
his
arm
and
said
in
a
rumbling
voice
dinner
he
took
in
irene
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
entertained
her
since
she
was
a
bride
june
was
the
portion
of
bosinney
who
was
placed
between
irene
and
his
fiancee

other
side

family
dinners

observe
certain
traditions
there
are
for
instance
no
hors
the
reason
for
this
is
unknown
theory
among
the
younger
members
traces
it
to
the
disgraceful
price
of
oysters
it
is
more
probably
due
to
a
desire
to
come
to
the
point
to
a
good
practical
sense
deciding
at
once
that
hors
are
but
poor
things
the
jameses
alone
unable
to
withstand
a
custom
almost
universal
in

now
and
then
unfaithful
a
silent
almost
morose
inattention
to

to
the
subsidence
into
their
seats

well
into

interspersed
with
remarks

as

dry
for
me
with
the
second
glass
of
champagne
a
kind
of
hum
makes
itself
heard
which
when
divested
of
casual
accessories
and
resolved
into
its
primal
element
is
found
to
be
james
telling
a
story
and
this
goes
on
for
a
long
time
encroaching
sometimes
even
upon
what
must
universally
be
recognised
as
the
crowning
point
of
a
forsyte
saddle
of
mutton
no
forsyte
has
given
a
dinner
without
providing
a
saddle
of
mutton
there
is
something
in
its
succulent
solidity
which
makes
it
suitable
to
people
a
certain
position
it
is
nourishing
and
tasty
the
sort
of
thing
a
man
remembers
eating
it
has
a
past
and
a
future
like
a
deposit
paid
into
a
bank
and
it
is
something
that
can
be
argued
about
each
branch
of
the
family
tenaciously
held
to
a
particular
jolyon
swearing
by
dartmoor
james
by
welsh
swithin
by
southdown
nicholas
maintaining
that
people
might
sneer
but
there
was
nothing
like
new
zealand
as
for
roger
the
of
the
brothers
he
had
been
obliged
to
invent
a
locality
of
his
own
and
with
an
ingenuity
worthy
of
a
man
who
had
devised
a
new
profession
for
his
sons
he
had
discovered
a
shop
where
they
sold
german
on
being
remonstrated
with
he
had
proved
his
point
by
producing
a
butcher
bill
which
showed
that
he
paid
more
than
any
of
the
others
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
old
jolyon
turning
to
june
had
said
in
one
of
his
bursts
of
philosophy
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
a
cranky
lot
the
find
it
out
as
you
grow
older
timothy
alone
held
apart
for
though
he
ate
saddle
of
mutton
heartily
he
was
he
said
afraid
of
it
to
anyone
interested
psychologically
in
forsytes
this
great
trait
is
of
prime
importance
not
only
does
it
illustrate
their
tenacity
both
collectively
and
as
individuals
but
it
marks
them
as
belonging
in
fibre
and
instincts
to
that
great
class
which
believes
in
nourishment
and
flavour
and
yields
to
no
sentimental
craving
for
beauty
younger
members
of
the
family
indeed
would
have
done
without
a
joint
altogether
preferring
or
lobster
which
appealed
to
the
imagination
and
had
less
these
were
females
or
if
not
had
been
corrupted
by
their
wives
or
by
mothers
who
having
been
forced
to
eat
saddle
of
mutton
throughout
their
married
lives
had
passed
a
secret
hostility
towards
it
into
the
fibre
of
their
sons
the
great
controversy
at
an
end
a
tewkesbury
ham
commenced
together
with
the
least
touch
of
west
was
so
long
over
this
course
that
he
caused
a
block
in
the
progress
of
the
dinner
to
devote
himself
to
it
with
better
heart
he
paused
in
his
conversation
from
his
seat
by
septimus
small
soames
was
watching
he
had
a
reason
of
his
own
connected
with
a
pet
building
scheme
for
observing
bosinney
the
architect
might
do
for
his
purpose
he
looked
clever
as
he
sat
leaning
back
in
his
chair
moodily
making
little
ramparts
with
soames
noted
his
dress
clothes
to
be
well
cut
but
too
small
as
though
made
many
years
ago
he
saw
him
turn
to
irene
and
say
something
and
her
face
sparkle
as
he
often
saw
it
sparkle
at
other
at
himself
he
tried
to
catch
what
they
were
saying
but
aunt
juley
was
speaking
had
that
always
seemed
very
extraordinary
to
soames
only
last
sunday
dear
scole
had
been
so
witty
in
his
sermon
so
sarcastic
for
what
he
had
said
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
his
own
soul
but
lose
all
his
property
that
he
had
said
was
the
motto
of
the
now
what
had
he
meant
by
that
of
course
it
might
be
what
people
did
know
what
did
soames
think
he
answered
abstractedly
how
should
i
know
scoles
is
a
humbug
though
is
he
for
bosinney
was
looking
round
the
table
as
if
pointing
out
the
peculiarities
of
the
guests
and
soames
wondered
what
he
was
saying
by
her
smile
irene
was
evidently
agreeing
with
his
remarks
she
seemed
always
to
agree
with
other
people
her
eyes
were
turned
on
himself
soames
dropped
his
glance
at
once
the
smile
had
died
off
her
lips
a
humbug
but
what
did
soames
mean
if
scoles
was
a
humbug
a
anybody
might
was
frightful
well
and
so
they
are
said
soames
during
aunt
juley
momentary
and
horrified
silence
he
caught
some
words
of
irene
that
sounded
like
hope
all
ye
who
enter
here
but
swithin
had
finished
his
ham
where
do
you
go
for
your
mushrooms
he
was
saying
to
irene
in
a
voice
like
a
courtier
you
ought
to
go
to
give
you
fresh
these
little
men
they
wo
take
the
trouble
irene
turned
to
answer
him
and
soames
saw
bosinney
watching
her
and
smiling
to
himself
a
curious
smile
the
fellow
had
a
arrangement
like
a
child
who
smiles
when
he
is
pleased
as
for
did
not
think
much
of
that
and
seeing
bosinney
turn
to
june
soames
smiled
too
but
did
not
like
june
who
was
not
looking
too
pleased
this
was
not
surprising
for
she
had
just
held
the
following
conversation
with
james
i
stayed
on
the
river
on
my
way
home
uncle
james
and
saw
a
beautiful
site
for
a
james
a
slow
and
thorough
eater
stopped
the
process
of
mastication
eh
he
said
now
where
was
that
close
to
james
placed
a
piece
of
ham
in
his
mouth
and
june
waited
i
suppose
you
would
know
whether
the
land
about
there
was
freehold
he
asked
at
last
you
would
know
anything
about
the
price
of
land
about
there
yes
said
june
i
made
her
little
resolute
face
under
its
copper
crown
was
suspiciously
eager
and
aglow
james
regarded
her
with
the
air
of
an
inquisitor
what
you
not
thinking
of
buying
land
he
ejaculated
dropping
his
fork
june
was
greatly
encouraged
by
his
interest
it
had
long
been
her
pet
plan
that
her
uncles
should
benefit
themselves
and
bosinney
by
building
of
course
not
she
said
i
thought
it
would
be
such
a
splendid
place
to
build
a
james
looked
at
her
sideways
and
placed
a
second
piece
of
ham
in
his
mouth
land
ought
to
be
very
dear
about
there
he
said
what
june
had
taken
for
personal
interest
was
only
the
impersonal
excitement
of
every
forsyte
who
hears
of
something
eligible
in
danger
of
passing
into
other
hands
but
she
refused
to
see
the
disappearance
of
her
chance
and
continued
to
press
her
point
you
ought
to
go
into
the
country
uncle
james
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
of
money
i
would
live
another
day
in
james
was
stirred
to
the
depths
of
his
long
thin
figure
he
had
no
idea
his
niece
held
such
downright
views
why
do
you
go
into
the
country
repeated
june
it
would
do
you
a
lot
of
why
began
james
in
a
fluster
buying
good
suppose
i
can
do
buying
land
building
houses
could
get
four
per
cent
for
my
money
what
does
that
matter
you
get
fresh
fresh
air
exclaimed
james
what
should
i
do
with
fresh
air
i
should
have
thought
anybody
liked
to
have
fresh
air
said
june
scornfully
james
wiped
his
napkin
all
over
his
mouth
you
do
know
the
value
of
money
he
said
avoiding
her
eye
no
and
i
hope
i
never
shall
and
biting
her
lip
with
inexpressible
mortification
poor
june
was
silent
why
were
her
own
relations
so
rich
and
phil
never
knew
where
the
money
was
coming
from
for
tobacco
why
could
they
do
something
for
him
but
they
were
so
selfish
why
could
they
build
she
had
all
that
naive
dogmatism
which
is
so
pathetic
and
sometimes
achieves
such
great
results
bosinney
to
whom
she
turned
in
her
discomfiture
was
talking
to
irene
and
a
chill
fell
on
spirit
her
eyes
grew
steady
with
anger
like
old
jolyon
when
his
will
was
crossed
james
too
was
much
disturbed
he
felt
as
though
someone
had
threatened
his
right
to
invest
his
money
at
five
per
cent
jolyon
had
spoiled
her
none
of
his
girls
would
have
said
such
a
thing
james
had
always
been
exceedingly
liberal
to
his
children
and
the
consciousness
of
this
made
him
feel
it
all
the
more
deeply
he
trifled
moodily
with
his
strawberries
then
deluging
them
with
cream
he
ate
them
quickly
they
at
all
events
should
not
escape
him
no
wonder
he
was
upset
engaged
for
years
he
had
been
admitted
a
solicitor
on
the
earliest
day
sanctioned
by
the
law
in
arranging
mortgages
preserving
investments
at
a
dead
level
of
high
and
safe
interest
conducting
negotiations
on
the
principle
of
securing
the
utmost
possible
out
of
other
people
compatible
with
safety
to
his
clients
and
himself
in
calculations
as
to
the
exact
pecuniary
possibilities
of
all
the
relations
of
life
he
had
come
at
last
to
think
purely
in
terms
of
money
money
was
now
his
light
his
medium
for
seeing
that
without
which
he
was
really
unable
to
see
really
not
cognisant
of
phenomena
and
to
have
this
thing
i
hope
i
shall
never
know
the
value
of
money
said
to
his
face
saddened
and
exasperated
him
he
knew
it
to
be
nonsense
or
it
would
have
frightened
him
what
was
the
world
coming
to
suddenly
recollecting
the
story
of
young
jolyon
however
he
felt
a
little
comforted
for
what
could
you
expect
with
a
father
like
that
this
turned
his
thoughts
into
a
channel
still
less
pleasant
what
was
all
this
talk
about
soames
and
irene
as
in
all
families
an
emporium
had
been
established
where
family
secrets
were
bartered
and
family
stock
priced
it
was
known
on
forsyte
that
irene
regretted
her
marriage
her
regret
was
disapproved
of
she
ought
to
have
known
her
own
mind
no
dependable
woman
made
these
mistakes
james
reflected
sourly
that
they
had
a
nice
house
rather
small
in
an
excellent
position
no
children
and
no
money
troubles
soames
was
reserved
about
his
affairs
but
he
must
be
getting
a
very
warm
man
he
had
a
capital
income
from
the
soames
like
his
father
was
a
member
of
that
firm
of
solicitors
forsyte
bustard
and
had
always
been
very
careful
he
had
done
quite
unusually
well
with
some
mortgages
he
had
taken
up
little
timely
lucky
hits
there
was
no
reason
why
irene
should
not
be
happy
yet
they
said
been
asking
for
a
separate
room
he
knew
where
that
ended
it
was
as
if
soames
drank
james
looked
at
his
that
unseen
glance
of
his
was
cold
and
dubious
appeal
and
fear
were
in
it
and
a
sense
of
personal
grievance
why
should
he
be
worried
like
this
it
was
very
likely
all
nonsense
women
were
funny
things
they
exaggerated
so
you
did
know
what
to
believe
and
then
nobody
told
him
anything
he
had
to
find
out
everything
for
himself
again
he
looked
furtively
at
irene
and
across
from
her
to
soames
the
latter
listening
to
aunt
juley
was
looking
up
under
his
brows
in
the
direction
of
bosinney
fond
of
her
i
know
thought
james
at
the
way
he
always
giving
her
things
and
the
extraordinary
unreasonableness
of
her
disaffection
struck
him
with
increased
force
it
was
a
pity
too
she
was
a
taking
little
thing
and
he
james
would
be
really
quite
fond
of
her
if
she
only
let
him
she
had
taken
up
lately
with
june
that
was
doing
her
no
good
that
was
certainly
doing
her
no
good
she
was
getting
to
have
opinions
of
her
own
he
know
what
she
wanted
with
anything
of
the
sort
she
a
good
home
and
everything
she
could
wish
for
he
felt
that
her
friends
ought
to
be
chosen
for
her
to
go
on
like
this
was
dangerous
june
indeed
with
her
habit
of
championing
the
unfortunate
had
dragged
from
irene
a
confession
and
in
return
had
preached
the
necessity
of
facing
the
evil
by
separation
if
need
be
but
in
the
face
of
these
exhortations
irene
had
kept
a
brooding
silence
as
though
she
found
terrible
the
thought
of
this
struggle
carried
through
in
cold
blood
he
would
never
give
her
up
she
had
said
to
june
who
cares
june
cried
let
him
do
what
he
only
to
stick
to
it
and
she
had
not
scrupled
to
say
something
of
this
sort
at
timothy
james
when
he
heard
of
it
had
felt
a
natural
indignation
and
horror
what
if
irene
were
to
take
it
into
her
head
could
hardly
frame
the
leave
soames
but
he
felt
this
thought
so
unbearable
that
he
at
once
put
it
away
the
shady
visions
it
conjured
up
the
sound
of
family
tongues
buzzing
in
his
ears
the
horror
of
the
conspicuous
happening
so
close
to
him
to
one
of
his
own
children
luckily
she
had
no
beggarly
fifty
pound
a
year
and
he
thought
of
the
deceased
heron
who
had
had
nothing
to
leave
her
with
contempt
brooding
over
his
glass
his
long
legs
twisted
under
the
table
he
quite
omitted
to
rise
when
the
ladies
left
the
room
he
would
have
to
speak
to
have
to
put
him
on
his
guard
they
could
not
go
on
like
this
now
that
such
a
contingency
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
noticed
with
sour
disfavour
that
june
had
left
her
full
of
wine
little
thing
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
he
mused
never
have
thought
of
it
herself
james
was
a
man
of
imagination
the
voice
of
swithin
roused
him
from
his
reverie
i
gave
four
hundred
pounds
for
it
he
was
saying
of
course
it
a
regular
work
of
four
hundred
h
that
a
lot
of
money
chimed
in
nicholas
the
object
alluded
to
was
an
elaborate
group
of
statuary
in
italian
marble
which
placed
upon
a
lofty
stand
also
of
marble
diffused
an
atmosphere
of
culture
throughout
the
room
the
subsidiary
figures
of
which
there
were
six
female
nude
and
of
highly
ornate
workmanship
were
all
pointing
towards
the
central
figure
also
nude
and
female
who
was
pointing
at
herself
and
all
this
gave
the
observer
a
very
pleasant
sense
of
her
extreme
value
aunt
juley
nearly
opposite
had
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
not
looking
at
it
all
the
evening
old
jolyon
spoke
it
was
he
who
had
started
the
discussion
four
hundred
fiddlesticks
do
tell
me
you
gave
four
hundred
for
that
between
the
points
of
his
collar
swithin
chin
made
the
second
painful
oscillatory
movement
of
the
evening
of
english
money
not
a
farthing
less
i
regret
it
it
not
common
genuine
modern
italian
soames
raised
the
corner
of
his
lip
in
a
smile
and
looked
across
at
bosinney
the
architect
was
grinning
behind
the
fumes
of
his
cigarette
now
indeed
he
looked
more
like
a
buccaneer
there
a
lot
of
work
about
it
remarked
james
hastily
who
was
really
moved
by
the
size
of
the
group
it
sell
well
at
the
poor
foreign
that
made
it
went
on
swithin
asked
me
five
gave
him
four
it
worth
eight
looked
poor
ah
chimed
in
nicholas
suddenly
poor
chaps
these
artists
it
a
wonder
to
me
how
they
live
now
there
young
flageoletti
that
fanny
and
the
girls
are
always
in
to
play
the
fiddle
if
he
makes
a
hundred
a
year
it
as
much
as
ever
he
does
james
shook
his
head
ah
he
said
i
do
know
how
they
live
old
jolyon
had
risen
and
cigar
in
mouth
went
to
inspect
the
group
at
close
quarters
would
have
given
two
for
it
he
pronounced
at
last
soames
saw
his
father
and
nicholas
glance
at
each
other
anxiously
and
on
the
other
side
of
swithin
bosinney
still
shrouded
in
smoke
wonder
what
he
thinks
of
it
thought
soames
who
knew
well
enough
that
this
group
was
hopelessly
vieux
jeu
hopelessly
of
the
last
generation
there
was
no
longer
any
sale
at
jobson
for
such
works
of
art
swithin
answer
came
at
last
you
never
knew
anything
about
a
statue
you
got
your
pictures
and
that
all
old
jolyon
walked
back
to
his
seat
puffing
his
cigar
it
was
not
likely
that
he
was
going
to
be
drawn
into
an
argument
with
an
obstinate
beggar
like
swithin
as
a
mule
who
had
never
known
a
statue
from
hat
stucco
was
all
he
said
it
had
long
been
physically
impossible
for
swithin
to
start
his
fist
came
down
on
the
table
stucco
i
should
like
to
see
anything
you
got
in
your
house
half
as
good
and
behind
his
speech
seemed
to
sound
again
that
rumbling
violence
of
primitive
generations
it
was
james
who
saved
the
situation
now
what
do
you
say
bosinney
you
an
architect
you
ought
to
know
all
about
statues
and
things
every
eye
was
turned
upon
bosinney
all
waited
with
a
strange
suspicious
look
for
his
answer
and
soames
speaking
for
the
first
time
asked
yes
bosinney
what
do
you
say
bosinney
replied
coolly
the
work
is
a
remarkable
his
words
were
addressed
to
swithin
his
eyes
smiled
slyly
at
old
jolyon
only
soames
remained
unsatisfied
remarkable
for
what
for
its
naivete
the
answer
was
followed
by
an
impressive
silence
swithin
alone
was
not
sure
whether
a
compliment
was
intended
chapter
of
the
house
soames
forsyte
walked
out
of
his
front
door
three
days
after
the
dinner
at
swithin
and
looking
back
from
across
the
square
confirmed
his
impression
that
the
house
wanted
painting
he
had
left
his
wife
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
her
hands
crossed
in
her
lap
manifestly
waiting
for
him
to
go
out
this
was
not
unusual
it
happened
in
fact
every
day
he
could
not
understand
what
she
found
wrong
with
him
it
was
not
as
if
he
drank
did
he
run
into
debt
or
gamble
or
swear
was
he
violent
were
his
friends
rackety
did
he
stay
out
at
night
on
the
contrary
the
profound
subdued
aversion
which
he
felt
in
his
wife
was
a
mystery
to
him
and
a
source
of
the
most
terrible
irritation
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
did
not
love
him
had
tried
to
love
him
and
could
not
love
him
was
obviously
no
reason
he
that
could
imagine
so
outlandish
a
cause
for
his
wife
not
getting
on
with
him
was
certainly
no
forsyte
soames
was
forced
therefore
to
set
the
blame
entirely
down
to
his
wife
he
had
never
met
a
woman
so
capable
of
inspiring
affection
they
could
not
go
anywhere
without
his
seeing
how
all
the
men
were
attracted
by
her
their
looks
manners
voices
betrayed
it
her
behaviour
under
this
attention
had
been
beyond
reproach
that
she
was
one
of
those
too
common
in
the
to
be
loved
and
to
love
who
when
not
loving
are
not
living
had
certainly
never
even
occurred
to
him
her
power
of
attraction
he
regarded
as
part
of
her
value
as
his
property
but
it
made
him
indeed
suspect
that
she
could
give
as
well
as
receive
and
she
gave
him
nothing
why
did
she
marry
me
was
his
continual
thought
he
had
forgotten
his
courtship
that
year
and
a
half
when
he
had
besieged
and
lain
in
wait
for
her
devising
schemes
for
her
entertainment
giving
her
presents
proposing
to
her
periodically
and
keeping
her
other
admirers
away
with
his
perpetual
presence
he
had
forgotten
the
day
when
adroitly
taking
advantage
of
an
acute
phase
of
her
dislike
to
her
home
surroundings
he
crowned
his
labours
with
success
if
he
remembered
anything
it
was
the
dainty
capriciousness
with
which
the
girl
had
treated
him
he
certainly
did
not
remember
the
look
on
her
passive
suddenly
one
day
she
had
yielded
and
said
that
she
would
marry
him
it
had
been
one
of
those
real
devoted
wooings
which
books
and
people
praise
when
the
lover
is
at
length
rewarded
for
hammering
the
iron
till
it
is
malleable
and
all
must
be
happy
ever
after
as
the
wedding
bells
soames
walked
eastwards
mousing
doggedly
along
on
the
shady
side
the
house
wanted
doing
up
unless
he
decided
to
move
into
the
country
and
build
for
the
hundredth
time
that
month
he
turned
over
this
problem
there
was
no
use
in
rushing
into
things
he
was
very
comfortably
off
with
an
increasing
income
getting
on
for
three
thousand
a
year
but
his
invested
capital
was
not
perhaps
so
large
as
his
father
had
a
tendency
to
expect
that
his
children
should
be
better
off
than
they
were
can
manage
eight
thousand
easily
enough
he
thought
calling
in
either
robertson
or
nicholl
he
had
stopped
to
look
in
at
a
picture
shop
for
soames
was
an
of
pictures
and
had
a
in
no
montpellier
square
full
of
canvases
stacked
against
the
wall
which
he
had
no
room
to
hang
he
brought
them
home
with
him
on
his
way
back
from
the
city
generally
after
dark
and
would
enter
this
room
on
sunday
afternoons
to
spend
hours
turning
the
pictures
to
the
light
examining
the
marks
on
their
backs
and
occasionally
making
notes
they
were
nearly
all
landscapes
with
figures
in
the
foreground
a
sign
of
some
mysterious
revolt
against
london
its
tall
houses
its
interminable
streets
where
his
life
and
the
lives
of
his
breed
and
class
were
passed
every
now
and
then
he
would
take
one
or
two
pictures
away
with
him
in
a
cab
and
stop
at
jobson
on
his
way
into
the
city
he
rarely
showed
them
to
anyone
irene
whose
opinion
he
secretly
respected
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
never
solicited
had
only
been
into
the
room
on
rare
occasions
in
discharge
of
some
wifely
duty
she
was
not
asked
to
look
at
the
pictures
and
she
never
did
to
soames
this
was
another
grievance
he
hated
that
pride
of
hers
and
secretly
dreaded
it
in
the
window
of
the
picture
shop
his
image
stood
and
looked
at
him
his
sleek
hair
under
the
brim
of
the
tall
hat
had
a
sheen
like
the
hat
itself
his
cheeks
pale
and
flat
the
line
of
his
lips
his
firm
chin
with
its
greyish
shaven
tinge
and
the
buttoned
strictness
of
his
black
coat
conveyed
an
appearance
of
reserve
and
secrecy
of
imperturbable
enforced
composure
but
his
eyes
cold
with
a
line
in
the
brow
between
them
examined
him
wistfully
as
if
they
knew
of
a
secret
weakness
he
noted
the
subjects
of
the
pictures
the
names
of
the
painters
made
a
calculation
of
their
values
but
without
the
satisfaction
he
usually
derived
from
this
inward
appraisement
and
walked
on
no
would
do
well
enough
for
another
year
if
he
decided
to
build
the
times
were
good
for
building
money
had
not
been
so
dear
for
years
and
the
site
he
had
seen
at
robin
hill
when
he
had
gone
down
there
in
the
spring
to
inspect
the
nicholl
could
be
better
within
twelve
miles
of
hyde
park
corner
the
value
of
the
land
certain
to
go
up
would
always
fetch
more
than
he
gave
for
it
so
that
a
house
if
built
in
really
good
style
was
a
investment
the
notion
of
being
the
one
member
of
his
family
with
a
country
house
weighed
but
little
with
him
for
to
a
true
forsyte
sentiment
even
the
sentiment
of
social
position
was
a
luxury
only
to
be
indulged
in
after
his
appetite
for
more
material
pleasure
had
been
satisfied
to
get
irene
out
of
london
away
from
opportunities
of
going
about
and
seeing
people
away
from
her
friends
and
those
who
put
ideas
into
her
head
that
was
the
thing
she
was
too
thick
with
june
june
disliked
him
he
returned
the
sentiment
they
were
of
the
same
blood
it
would
be
everything
to
get
irene
out
of
town
the
house
would
please
her
she
would
enjoy
messing
about
with
the
decoration
she
was
very
artistic
the
house
must
be
in
good
style
something
that
would
always
be
certain
to
command
a
price
something
unique
like
that
last
house
of
parkes
which
had
a
tower
but
parkes
had
himself
said
that
his
architect
was
ruinous
you
never
knew
where
you
were
with
those
fellows
if
they
had
a
name
they
ran
you
into
no
end
of
expense
and
were
conceited
into
the
bargain
and
a
common
architect
was
no
memory
of
parkes
tower
precluded
the
employment
of
a
common
architect
this
was
why
he
had
thought
of
bosinney
since
the
dinner
at
he
had
made
enquiries
the
result
of
which
had
been
meagre
but
encouraging
one
of
the
new
clever
as
clever
as
you
bit
up
in
the
air
he
had
not
been
able
to
discover
what
houses
bosinney
had
built
nor
what
his
charges
were
the
impression
he
gathered
was
that
he
would
be
able
to
make
his
own
terms
the
more
he
reflected
on
the
idea
the
more
he
liked
it
it
would
be
keeping
the
thing
in
the
family
with
forsytes
almost
an
instinct
and
he
would
be
able
to
get
if
not
nominal
fair
considering
the
chance
to
bosinney
of
displaying
his
talents
for
this
house
must
be
no
common
edifice
soames
reflected
complacently
on
the
work
it
would
be
sure
to
bring
the
young
man
for
like
every
forsyte
he
could
be
a
thorough
optimist
when
there
was
anything
to
be
had
out
of
it
bosinney
office
was
in
sloane
street
close
at
hand
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
keep
his
eye
continually
on
the
plans
again
irene
would
not
be
to
likely
to
object
to
leave
london
if
her
greatest
friend
lover
were
given
the
job
june
marriage
might
depend
on
it
irene
could
not
decently
stand
in
the
way
of
june
marriage
she
would
never
do
that
he
knew
her
too
well
and
june
would
be
pleased
of
this
he
saw
the
advantage
bosinney
looked
clever
but
he
had
was
one
of
his
great
air
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
on
which
side
his
bread
were
buttered
he
should
be
easy
to
deal
with
in
money
matters
soames
made
this
reflection
in
no
defrauding
spirit
it
was
the
natural
attitude
of
his
the
mind
of
any
good
business
all
those
thousands
of
good
business
men
through
whom
he
was
threading
his
way
up
ludgate
hill
thus
he
fulfilled
the
inscrutable
laws
of
his
great
human
nature
he
reflected
with
a
sense
of
comfort
that
bosinney
would
be
easy
to
deal
with
in
money
matters
while
he
elbowed
his
way
on
his
eyes
which
he
usually
kept
fixed
on
the
ground
before
his
feet
were
attracted
upwards
by
the
dome
of
paul
it
had
a
peculiar
fascination
for
him
that
old
dome
and
not
once
but
twice
or
three
times
a
week
would
he
halt
in
his
daily
pilgrimage
to
enter
beneath
and
stop
in
the
side
aisles
for
five
or
ten
minutes
scrutinizing
the
names
and
epitaphs
on
the
monuments
the
attraction
for
him
of
this
great
church
was
inexplicable
unless
it
enabled
him
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
on
the
business
of
the
day
if
any
affair
of
particular
moment
or
demanding
peculiar
acuteness
was
weighing
on
his
mind
he
invariably
went
in
to
wander
with
attention
from
epitaph
to
epitaph
then
retiring
in
the
same
noiseless
way
he
would
hold
steadily
on
up
cheapside
a
thought
more
of
dogged
purpose
in
his
gait
as
though
he
had
seen
something
which
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
buy
he
went
in
this
morning
but
instead
of
stealing
from
monument
to
monument
turned
his
eyes
upwards
to
the
columns
and
spacings
of
the
walls
and
remained
motionless
his
uplifted
face
with
the
awed
and
wistful
look
which
faces
take
on
themselves
in
church
was
whitened
to
a
chalky
hue
in
the
vast
building
his
gloved
hands
were
clasped
in
front
over
the
handle
of
his
umbrella
he
lifted
them
some
sacred
inspiration
perhaps
had
come
to
him
he
thought
must
have
room
to
hang
my
pictures
that
evening
on
his
return
from
the
city
he
called
at
office
he
found
the
architect
in
his
smoking
a
pipe
and
ruling
off
lines
on
a
plan
soames
refused
a
drink
and
came
at
once
to
the
point
if
you
nothing
better
to
do
on
sunday
come
down
with
me
to
robin
hill
and
give
me
your
opinion
on
a
building
are
you
going
to
build
perhaps
said
soames
but
do
speak
of
it
i
just
want
your
quite
so
said
the
architect
soames
peered
about
the
room
you
rather
high
up
here
he
remarked
any
information
he
could
gather
about
the
nature
and
scope
of
business
would
be
all
to
the
good
it
does
well
enough
for
me
so
far
answered
the
architect
accustomed
to
the
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
but
replaced
it
empty
between
his
teeth
it
assisted
him
perhaps
to
carry
on
the
conversation
soames
noted
a
hollow
in
each
cheek
made
as
it
were
by
suction
what
do
you
pay
for
an
office
like
this
said
he
fifty
too
much
replied
bosinney
this
answer
impressed
soames
favourably
i
suppose
it
is
dear
he
said
i
call
for
sunday
about
the
following
sunday
therefore
he
called
for
bosinney
in
a
hansom
and
drove
him
to
the
station
on
arriving
at
robin
hill
they
found
no
cab
and
started
to
walk
the
mile
and
a
half
to
the
site
it
was
the
of
perfect
day
with
a
burning
sun
and
cloudless
in
the
straight
narrow
road
leading
up
the
hill
their
feet
kicked
up
a
yellow
dust
gravel
soil
remarked
soames
and
sideways
he
glanced
at
the
coat
bosinney
wore
into
the
of
this
coat
were
thrust
bundles
of
papers
and
under
one
arm
was
carried
a
stick
soames
noted
these
and
other
peculiarities
no
one
but
a
clever
man
or
indeed
a
buccaneer
would
have
taken
such
liberties
with
his
appearance
and
though
these
eccentricities
were
revolting
to
soames
he
derived
a
certain
satisfaction
from
them
as
evidence
of
qualities
by
which
he
must
inevitably
profit
if
the
fellow
could
build
houses
what
did
his
clothes
matter
i
told
you
he
said
that
i
want
this
house
to
be
a
surprise
so
do
say
anything
about
it
i
never
talk
of
my
affairs
until
carried
bosinney
nodded
let
women
into
your
plans
pursued
soames
and
you
never
know
where
it
ah
said
bosinney
women
are
the
devil
this
feeling
had
long
been
at
of
soames
heart
he
had
never
however
put
it
into
words
oh
he
muttered
so
you
beginning
to
he
stopped
but
added
with
an
uncontrollable
burst
of
spite
june
got
a
temper
of
her
a
temper
not
a
bad
thing
in
an
soames
had
never
called
irene
an
angel
he
could
not
so
have
violated
his
best
instincts
letting
other
people
into
the
secret
of
her
value
and
giving
himself
away
he
made
no
reply
they
had
struck
into
a
road
across
a
warren
a
led
at
to
a
gravel
pit
beyond
which
the
chimneys
of
a
cottage
rose
amongst
a
clump
of
trees
at
the
border
of
a
thick
wood
tussocks
of
feathery
grass
covered
the
rough
surface
of
the
ground
and
out
of
these
the
larks
soared
into
the
haze
of
sunshine
on
the
far
horizon
over
a
countless
succession
of
fields
and
hedges
rose
a
line
of
downs
soames
led
till
they
had
crossed
to
the
far
side
and
there
he
stopped
it
was
the
chosen
site
but
now
that
he
was
about
to
divulge
the
spot
to
another
he
had
become
uneasy
the
agent
lives
in
that
cottage
he
said
he
give
us
some
better
have
lunch
before
we
go
into
this
he
again
took
the
lead
to
the
cottage
where
the
agent
a
tall
man
named
oliver
with
a
heavy
face
and
grizzled
beard
welcomed
them
during
lunch
which
soames
hardly
touched
he
kept
looking
at
bosinney
and
once
or
twice
passed
his
silk
handkerchief
stealthily
over
his
forehead
the
meal
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
bosinney
rose
i
dare
say
you
got
business
to
talk
over
he
said
i
just
go
and
nose
about
a
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
strolled
out
soames
was
solicitor
to
this
estate
and
he
spent
nearly
an
hour
in
the
agent
company
looking
at
and
discussing
the
nicholl
and
other
mortgages
it
was
as
it
were
by
an
afterthought
that
he
brought
up
the
question
of
the
building
site
your
people
he
said
ought
to
come
down
in
their
price
to
me
considering
that
i
shall
be
the
first
to
oliver
shook
his
head
the
site
you
fixed
on
sir
he
said
is
the
cheapest
we
got
sites
at
the
top
of
the
slope
are
dearer
by
a
good
mind
said
soames
i
not
decided
it
quite
possible
i
build
at
all
the
ground
rent
very
well
forsyte
i
shall
be
sorry
if
you
go
off
and
i
think
make
a
mistake
sir
there
not
a
bit
of
land
near
london
with
such
a
view
as
this
nor
one
that
cheaper
all
things
considered
we
only
to
advertise
to
get
a
mob
of
people
after
they
looked
at
each
other
their
faces
said
very
plainly
respect
you
as
a
man
of
business
and
you
ca
expect
me
to
believe
a
word
you
say
well
repeated
soames
i
have
made
up
my
mind
the
thing
will
very
likely
go
off
with
these
words
taking
up
his
umbrella
he
put
his
chilly
hand
into
the
agent
withdrew
it
without
the
faintest
pressure
and
went
out
into
the
sun
he
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
site
in
deep
thought
his
instinct
told
him
that
what
the
agent
had
said
was
true
a
cheap
site
and
the
beauty
of
it
was
that
he
knew
the
agent
did
not
really
think
it
cheap
so
that
his
own
intuitive
knowledge
was
a
victory
over
the
agent
or
not
i
mean
to
have
it
he
thought
the
larks
sprang
up
in
front
of
his
feet
the
air
was
full
of
butterflies
a
sweet
fragrance
rose
from
the
wild
grasses
the
sappy
scent
of
the
bracken
stole
forth
from
the
wood
where
hidden
in
the
depths
pigeons
were
cooing
and
from
afar
on
the
warm
breeze
came
the
rhythmic
chiming
of
church
bells
soames
walked
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
his
lips
opening
and
closing
as
though
in
anticipation
of
a
delicious
morsel
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
site
bosinney
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
after
waiting
some
little
time
he
crossed
the
warren
in
the
direction
of
the
slope
he
would
have
shouted
but
dreaded
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
warren
was
as
lonely
as
a
prairie
its
silence
only
broken
by
the
rustle
of
rabbits
bolting
to
their
holes
and
the
song
of
the
larks
soames
the
of
the
great
forsyte
army
advancing
to
the
civilization
of
this
wilderness
felt
his
spirit
daunted
by
the
loneliness
by
the
invisible
singing
and
the
hot
sweet
air
he
had
begun
to
retrace
his
steps
when
he
at
last
caught
sight
of
bosinney
the
architect
was
sprawling
under
a
large
oak
tree
whose
trunk
with
a
huge
spread
of
bough
and
foliage
ragged
with
age
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
rise
soames
had
to
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
before
he
looked
up
hallo
forsyte
he
said
i
found
the
very
place
for
your
house
look
here
soames
stood
and
looked
then
he
said
coldly
you
may
be
very
clever
but
this
site
will
cost
me
half
as
much
hang
the
cost
man
look
at
the
view
almost
from
their
feet
stretched
ripe
corn
dipping
to
a
small
dark
copse
beyond
a
plain
of
fields
and
hedges
spread
to
the
distant
in
a
silver
streak
to
the
right
could
be
seen
the
line
of
the
river
the
sky
was
so
blue
and
the
sun
so
bright
that
an
eternal
summer
seemed
to
reign
over
this
prospect
thistledown
floated
round
them
enraptured
by
the
serenity
of
the
ether
the
heat
danced
over
the
corn
and
pervading
all
was
a
soft
insensible
hum
like
the
murmur
of
bright
minutes
holding
revel
between
earth
and
heaven
soames
looked
in
spite
of
himself
something
swelled
in
his
breast
to
live
here

sight
of
all
this

be
able
to
point
it
out
to
his
friends
to
talk
of
it
to
possess
it
his
cheeks
flushed
the
warmth
the
radiance
the
glow
were
sinking
into
his
senses
as
four
years
before
irene
beauty
had
sunk
into
his
senses
and
made
him
long
for
her
he
stole
a
glance
at
bosinney
whose
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
coachman
leopard
seemed
running
wild
over
the
landscape
the
sunlight
had
caught
the
promontories
of
the
fellow
face
the
bumpy
cheekbones
the
point
of
his
chin
the
vertical
ridges
above
his
brow
and
soames
watched
this
rugged
enthusiastic
careless
face
with
an
unpleasant
feeling
a
long
soft
ripple
of
wind
flowed
over
the
corn
and
brought
a
puff
of
warm
air
into
their
faces
i
could
build
you
a
teaser
here
said
bosinney
breaking
the
silence
at
last
i
dare
say
replied
soames
drily
you
have
got
to
pay
for
for
about
eight
thousand
i
could
build
you
a
soames
had
become
very
struggle
was
going
on
within
him
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
said
stubbornly
i
ca
afford
and
slowly
with
his
mousing
walk
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
first
site
they
spent
some
time
there
going
into
particulars
of
the
projected
house
and
then
soames
returned
to
the
agent
cottage
he
came
out
in
about
half
an
hour
and
joining
bosinney
started
for
the
station
well
he
said
hardly
opening
his
lips
i
taken
that
site
of
yours
after
and
again
he
was
silent
confusedly
debating
how
it
was
that
this
fellow
whom
by
habit
he
despised
should
have
overborne
his
own
decision

at

a

a
little
court
tiled
with
tiles
and
surrounded
by

hydrangeas
in
tubs
here
under
a

covering

for
its

the
house
was
commodious
there
were
countless
nooks
resembling
birds
nests
and
little
things
made
of
silver
were
deposited
like
eggs
in
this
general
perfection
two
kinds
of
fastidiousness
were
at

there
lived
here
a
mistress
who
would
have
dwelt
daintily
on
a
desert
island
a
master
whose
daintiness
was
as
it
were
an
investment
cultivated
by
the
owner
for
his
advancement
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
competition
this
competitive
daintiness
had
caused
soames
in
his
marlborough
days
to
be
the
first
boy
into
white
waistcoats
in
summer
and
corduroy
waistcoats
in
winter
had
prevented
him
from
ever
appearing
in

with
his
tie
climbing
up

collar

induced
him
to
dust
his
patent
leather
boots
before
a
great
multitude
assembled
on

to
hear
him
recite

immaculateness
had
grown
over
soames
as
over
many
londoners
impossible
to
conceive
of
him
with
a
hair
out
of
place
a
tie
deviating
of
an
inch
from
the
perpendicular
a
collar
unglossed
he
would
not
have
gone
without
a
bath
for
was
the
fashion
to
take
baths
and
how
bitter
was
his
scorn
of
people
who
omitted
them
but
irene
could
be
imagined
like
some
nymph
bathing
in
wayside
streams
for
the
joy
of
the
freshness
and
of
seeing
her
own
fair
body
in
this
conflict
throughout
the
house
the
woman
had
gone
to
the
wall
as
in
the
struggle
between
saxon
and
celt
still
going
on
within
the
nation
the
more
impressionable
and
receptive
temperament
had
had
forced
on
it
a
conventional
superstructure
thus
the
house
had
acquired
a
close
resemblance
to
hundreds
of
other
houses

the
same
high
aspirations

though
the

be

the
phrase
is
just
on
the
evening
of
august
a
week
after
the
expedition
to
robin
hill
in
the
of
this
individual
my
and
irene
were
seated
at
dinner
a
hot
dinner
on
sundays
was
a
little
distinguishing
elegance
common
to
this
house
and
many
others
early
in
married
life
soames
had
laid
down
the
rule
servants
must
give
us
hot
dinner
on
nothing
to
do
but
play
the
concertina
the
custom
had
produced
no
revolution
soames
a
rather
deplorable
were
devoted
to
irene
who
in
defiance
of
all
safe
tradition
appeared
to
recognise
their
right
to
a
share
in
the
weaknesses
of
human
nature
the
happy
pair
were
seated
not
opposite
each
other
but
rectangularly
at
the
handsome
rosewood
table
they
dined
without
a
distinguishing
so
far
had
not
spoken
a
word
soames
liked
to
talk
during
dinner
about
business
or
what
he
had
been
buying
and
so
long
as
he
talked
irene
silence
did
not
distress
him
this
evening
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
talk
the
decision
to
build
had
been
weighing
on
his
mind
all
the
week
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
her
his
nervousness
about
this
disclosure
irritated
him
profoundly
she
had
no
business
to
make
him
feel
like
wife
and
a
husband
being
one
person
she
had
not
looked
at
him
once
since
they
sat
down
and
he
wondered
what
on
earth
she
had
been
thinking
about
all
the
time
it
was
hard
when
a
man
worked
as
he
did
making
money
for
and
with
an
ache
in
his
she
should
sit
there
as
if
she
saw
the
walls
of
the
room
closing
in
it
was
enough
to
make
a
man
get
up
and
leave
the
table
the
light
from
the
lamp
fell
on
her
neck
and
liked
her
to
dine
in
a
low
dress
it
gave
him
an
inexpressible
feeling
of
superiority
to
the
majority
of
his
acquaintance
whose
wives
were
contented
with
their
best
high
frocks
or
with
when
they
dined
at
home
under
that
rosy
light
her
hair
and
fair
skin
made
strange
contrast
with
her
dark
brown
eyes
could
a
man
own
anything
prettier
than
this
with
its
deep
tints
the
starry
roses
the
glass
and
quaint
silver
furnishing
could
a
man
own
anything
prettier
than
the
woman
who
sat
at
it
gratitude
was
no
virtue
among
forsytes
who
competitive
and
full
of
had
no
occasion
for
it
and
soames
only
experienced
a
sense
of
exasperation
amounting
to
pain
that
he
did
not
own
her
as
it
was
his
right
to
own
her
that
he
could
not
as
by
stretching
out
his
hand
to
that
rose
pluck
her
and
sniff
the
very
secrets
of
her
heart
out
of
his
other
property
out
of
all
the
things
he
had
collected
his
silver
his
pictures
his
houses
his
investments
he
got
a
secret
and
intimate
feeling
out
of
her
he
got
none
in
this
house
of
his
there
was
writing
on
every
wall
his
temperament
protested
against
a
mysterious
warning
that
she
was
not
made
for
him
he
had
married
this
woman
conquered
her
made
her
his
own
and
it
seemed
to
him
contrary
to
the
most
fundamental
of
all
laws
the
law
of
possession
that
he
could
do
no
more
than
own
her
indeed
he
could
do
that
which
he
was
beginning
to
doubt
if
any
one
had
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
own
her
soul
the
question
would
have
seemed
to
him
both
ridiculous
and
sentimental
but
he
did
so
want
and
the
writing
said
he
never
would
she
was
ever
silent
passive
gracefully
averse
as
though
terrified
lest
by
word
motion
or
sign
she
might
lead
him
to
believe
that
she
was
fond
of
him
and
he
asked
himself
must
i
always
go
on
like
this
like
most
novel
readers
of
his
generation
and
soames
was
a
great
novel
reader
literature
coloured
his
view
of
life
and
he
had
imbibed
the
belief
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
in
the
end
the
husband
always
gained
the
affection
of
his
wife
even
in
those
class
of
book
he
was
not
very
fond
ended
in
tragedy
the
wife
always
died
with
poignant
regrets
on
her
lips
or
if
it
were
the
husband
who
herself
on
his
body
in
an
agony
of
remorse
he
often
took
irene
to
the
theatre
instinctively
choosing
the
modern
society
plays
with
the
modern
society
conjugal
problem
so
fortunately
different
from
any
conjugal
problem
in
real
life
he
found
that
they
too
always
ended
in
the
same
way
even
when
there
was
a
lover
in
the
case
while
he
was
watching
the
play
soames
often
sympathized
with
the
lover
but
before
he
reached
home
again
driving
with
irene
in
a
hansom
he
saw
that
this
would
not
do
and
he
was
glad
the
play
had
ended
as
it
had
there
was
one
class
of
husband
that
had
just
then
come
into
fashion
the
strong
rather
rough
but
extremely
sound
man
who
was
peculiarly
successful
at
the
end
of
the
play
with
this
person
soames
was
really
not
in
sympathy
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
own
position
would
have
expressed
his
disgust
with
the
fellow
but
he
was
so
conscious
of
how
vital
to
himself
was
the
necessity
for
being
a
successful
even
a
husband
that
he
never
spoke
of
a
distaste
born
perhaps
by
the
perverse
processes
of
nature
out
of
a
secret
fund
of
brutality
in
himself
but
irene
silence
this
evening
was
exceptional
he
had
never
before
seen
such
an
expression
on
her
face
and
since
it
is
always
the
unusual
which
alarms
soames
was
alarmed
he
ate
his
savoury
and
hurried
the
maid
as
she
swept
off
the
crumbs
with
the
silver
sweeper
when
she
had
left
the
room
he
filled
his
glass
with
wine
and
said
anybody
been
here
this
afternoon
what
did
she
want
it
was
an
axiom
with
the
forsytes
that
people
did
not
go
anywhere
unless
they
wanted
something
came
to
talk
about
her
lover
i
suppose
irene
made
no
reply
it
looks
to
me
continued
soames
as
if
she
were
sweeter
on
him
than
he
is
on
her
she
always
following
him
irene
eyes
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
you
no
business
to
say
such
a
thing
she
exclaimed
why
not
anybody
can
see
they
can
not
and
if
they
could
it
disgraceful
to
say
soames
composure
gave
way
you
a
pretty
wife
he
said
but
secretly
he
wondered
at
the
heat
of
her
reply
it
was
unlike
her
you
cracked
about
june
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
now
that
she
has
the
buccaneer
in
tow
she
does
care
twopence
about
you
and
you
find
it
out
but
you
wo
see
so
much
of
her
in
future
we
going
to
live
in
the
he
had
been
glad
to
get
his
news
out
under
cover
of
this
burst
of
irritation
he
had
expected
a
cry
of
dismay
the
silence
with
which
his
pronouncement
was
received
alarmed
him
you
do
seem
interested
he
was
obliged
to
add
i
knew
it
he
looked
at
her
sharply
who
told
you
how
did
she
know
irene
did
not
answer
baffled
and
uncomfortable
he
said
it
a
fine
thing
for
bosinney
it
be
the
making
of
him
i
suppose
she
told
you
all
about
it
there
was
another
pause
and
then
soames
said
i
suppose
you
do
want
to
go
irene
made
no
reply
well
i
ca
tell
what
you
want
you
never
seem
contented
have
my
wishes
anything
to
do
with
it
she
took
the
vase
of
roses
and
left
the
room
soames
remained
seated
was
it
for
this
that
he
had
signed
that
contract
was
it
for
this
that
he
was
going
to
spend
some
ten
thousand
pounds
bosinney
phrase
came
back
to
him
women
are
the
devil
but
presently
he
grew
calmer
it
might
have
been
worse
she
might
have
flared
up
he
had
expected
something
more
than
this
it
was
lucky
after
all
that
june
had
broken
the
ice
for
him
she
must
have
wormed
it
out
of
bosinney
he
might
have
known
she
would
he
lighted
his
cigarette
after
all
irene
had
not
made
a
scene
she
would
come
was
the
best
of
her
she
was
cold
but
not
sulky
and
puffing
the
cigarette
smoke
at
a
on
the
shining
table
he
plunged
into
a
reverie
about
the
house
it
was
no
good
worrying
he
would
go
and
make
it
up
presently
she
would
be
sitting
out
there
in
the
dark
under
the
japanese
sunshade
knitting
a
beautiful
warm
night
in
truth
june
had
come
in
that
afternoon
with
shining
eyes
and
the
words
soames
is
a
brick
it
splendid
for
very
thing
for
him
irene
face
remaining
dark
and
puzzled
she
went
on
your
new
house
at
robin
hill
of
course
what
do
you
know
irene
did
not
know
oh
then
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
told
you
looking
impatiently
at
her
friend
she
cried
you
look
as
if
you
did
care
do
you
see
it
what
i
been
praying
very
chance
he
been
wanting
all
this
time
now
you
see
what
he
can
do
and
thereupon
she
poured
out
the
whole
story
since
her
own
engagement
she
had
not
seemed
much
interested
in
her
friend
position
the
hours
she
spent
with
irene
were
given
to
confidences
of
her
own
and
at
times
for
all
her
affectionate
pity
it
was
impossible
to
keep
out
of
her
smile
a
trace
of
compassionate
contempt
for
the
woman
who
had
made
such
a
mistake
in
her
a
vast
ridiculous
mistake
he
to
have
all
the
decorations
as
free
hand
it
june
broke
into
laughter
her
little
figure
quivered
gleefully
she
raised
her
hand
and
struck
a
blow
at
a
muslin
curtain
do
you
know
i
even
asked
uncle
james
but
with
a
sudden
dislike
to
mentioning
that
incident
she
stopped
and
presently
finding
her
friend
so
unresponsive
went
away
she
looked
back
from
the
pavement
and
irene
was
still
standing
in
the
doorway
in
response
to
her
farewell
wave
irene
put
her
hand
to
her
brow
and
turning
slowly
shut
the
door
soames
went
to
the
presently
and
peered
at
her
through
the
window
out
in
the
shadow
of
the
japanese
sunshade
she
was
sitting
very
still
the
lace
on
her
white
shoulders
stirring
with
the
soft
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
but
about
this
silent
creature
sitting
there
so
motionless
in
the
dark
there
seemed
a
warmth
a
hidden
fervour
of
feeling
as
if
the
whole
of
her
being
had
been
stirred
and
some
change
were
taking
place
in
its
very
depths
he
stole
back
to
the
unnoticed
chapter
at
large
it
was
not
long
before
soames
determination
to
build
went
the
round
of
the
family
and
created
the
flutter
that
any
decision
connected
with
property
should
make
among
forsytes
it
was
not
his
fault
for
he
had
been
determined
that
no
one
should
know
june
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
had
told
small
giving
her
leave
only
to
tell
aunt
thought
it
would
cheer
her
the
poor
old
sweet
for
aunt
ann
had
kept
her
room
now
for
many
days
small
told
aunt
ann
at
once
who
smiling
as
she
lay
back
on
her
pillows
said
in
her
distinct
trembling
old
voice
it
very
nice
for
dear
june
but
i
hope
they
will
be
rather
dangerous
when
she
was
left
alone
again
a
frown
like
a
cloud
presaging
a
rainy
morrow
crossed
her
face
while
she
was
lying
there
so
many
days
the
process
of
recharging
her
will
went
on
all
the
time
it
spread
to
her
face
too
and
tightening
movements
were
always
in
action
at
the
corners
of
her
lips
the
maid
smither
who
had
been
in
her
service
since
girlhood
and
was
spoken
of
as
good
so
slow
maid
smither
performed
every
morning
with
extreme
punctiliousness
the
crowning
ceremony
of
that
ancient
toilet
taking
from
the
recesses
of
their
pure
white
those
flat
grey
curls
the
insignia
of
personal
dignity
she
placed
them
securely
in
her
mistress
hands
and
turned
her
back
and
every
day
aunts
juley
and
hester
were
required
to
come
and
report
on
timothy
what
news
there
was
of
nicholas
whether
dear
june
had
succeeded
in
getting
jolyon
to
shorten
the
engagement
now
that
bosinney
was
building
soames
a
house
whether
young
roger
wife
was
how
the
operation
on
archie
had
succeeded
and
what
swithin
had
done
about
that
empty
house
in
wigmore
street
where
the
tenant
had
lost
all
his
money
and
treated
him
so
badly
above
all
about
soames
was
irene
asking
for
a
separate
room
and
every
morning
smither
was
told
i
shall
be
coming
down
this
afternoon
smither
about
two
i
shall
want
your
arm
after
all
these
days
in
bed
after
telling
aunt
ann
small
had
spoken
of
the
house
in
the
strictest
confidence
to
nicholas
who
in
her
turn
had
asked
winifred
dartie
for
confirmation
supposing
of
course
that
being
soames
sister
she
would
know
all
about
it
through
her
it
had
in
due
course
come
round
to
the
ears
of
james
he
had
been
a
good
deal
agitated
nobody
he
said
told
him
and
rather
than
go
direct
to
soames
himself
of
whose
taciturnity
he
was
afraid
he
took
his
umbrella
and
went
round
to
timothy
he
found
septimus
and
hester
who
had
been
was
so
safe
she
found
it
tiring
to
talk
ready
and
indeed
eager
to
discuss
the
news
it
was
very
good
of
dear
soames
they
thought
to
employ
bosinney
but
rather
risky
what
had
george
named
him
how
droll
but
george
was
always
droll
however
it
would
be
all
in
the
family
they
supposed
they
must
really
look
upon
bosinney
as
belonging
to
the
family
though
it
seemed
strange
james
here
broke
in
nobody
knows
anything
about
him
i
do
see
what
soames
wants
with
a
young
man
like
that
i
should
be
surprised
if
irene
had
put
her
oar
in
i
shall
speak
to
soames
interposed
aunt
juley
told
bosinney
that
he
did
wish
it
mentioned
he
would
like
it
to
be
talked
about
i
sure
and
if
timothy
knew
he
would
be
very
vexed
i
james
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
what
he
said
i
getting
very
deaf
i
suppose
i
do
hear
people
emily
got
a
bad
toe
we
sha
be
able
to
start
for
wales
till
the
end
of
the
month
there
always
something
and
having
got
what
he
wanted
he
took
his
hat
and
went
away
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
and
he
walked
across
the
park
towards
soames
where
he
intended
to
dine
for
emily
toe
kept
her
in
bed
and
rachel
and
cicely
were
on
a
visit
to
the
country
he
took
the
slanting
path
from
the
bayswater
side
of
the
row
to
the
knightsbridge
gate
across
a
pasture
of
short
burnt
grass
dotted
with
blackened
sheep
strewn
with
seated
couples
and
strange
waifs
lying
prone
on
their
faces
like
corpses
on
a
field
over
which
the
wave
of
battle
has
rolled
he
walked
rapidly
his
head
bent
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
the
appearance
of
this
park
the
centre
of
his
own
where
he
had
all
his
life
been
fighting
excited
no
thought
or
speculation
in
his
mind
these
corpses
flung
down
there
from
out
the
press
and
turmoil
of
the
struggle
these
pairs
of
lovers
sitting
cheek
by
jowl
for
an
hour
of
idle
elysium
snatched
from
the
monotony
of
their
treadmill
awakened
no
fancies
in
his
mind
he
had
outlived
that
kind
of
imagination
his
nose
like
the
nose
of
a
sheep
was
fastened
to
the
pastures
on
which
he
browsed
one
of
his
tenants
had
lately
shown
a
disposition
to
be
in
his
rent
and
it
had
become
a
grave
question
whether
he
had
not
better
turn
him
out
at
once
and
so
run
the
risk
of
not
before
christmas
swithin
had
just
been
let
in
very
badly
but
it
had
served
him
had
held
on
too
long
he
pondered
this
as
he
walked
steadily
holding
his
umbrella
carefully
by
the
wood
just
below
the
crook
of
the
handle
so
as
to
keep
the
ferule
off
the
ground
and
not
fray
the
silk
in
the
middle
and
with
his
thin
high
shoulders
stooped
his
long
legs
moving
with
swift
mechanical
precision
this
passage
through
the
park
where
the
sun
shone
with
a
clear
flame
on
so
much
so
many
human
evidences
of
the
remorseless
battle
of
property
raging
beyond
its
like
the
flight
of
some
land
bird
across
the
sea
he
felt
a
touch
on
the
arm
as
he
came
out
at
albert
gate
it
was
soames
who
crossing
from
the
shady
side
of
piccadilly
where
he
had
been
walking
home
from
the
office
had
suddenly
appeared
alongside
your
mother
in
bed
said
james
i
was
just
coming
to
you
but
i
suppose
i
shall
be
in
the
the
outward
relations
between
james
and
his
son
were
marked
by
a
lack
of
sentiment
peculiarly
forsytean
but
for
all
that
the
two
were
by
no
means
unattached
perhaps
they
regarded
one
another
as
an
investment
certainly
they
were
solicitous
of
each
other
welfare
glad
of
each
other
company
they
had
never
exchanged
two
words
upon
the
more
intimate
problems
of
life
or
revealed
in
each
other
presence
the
existence
of
any
deep
feeling
something
beyond
the
power
of
bound
them
together
something
hidden
deep
in
the
fibre
of
nations
and
blood
they
say
is
thicker
than
neither
of
them
was
a
man
indeed
in
james
love
of
his
children
was
now
the
prime
motive
of
his
existence
to
have
creatures
who
were
parts
of
himself
to
whom
he
might
transmit
the
money
he
saved
was
at
the
root
of
his
saving
and
at
what
was
left
that
could
give
him
pleasure
the
kernel
of
life
was
in
this
saving
for
his
children
than
james
forsyte
notwithstanding
all
his
there
was
no
saner
man
if
the
leading
symptom
of
sanity
as
we
are
told
is
though
without
doubt
timothy
went
too
far
in
all
this
london
of
which
he
owned
so
much
and
loved
with
such
a
dumb
love
as
the
centre
of
his
opportunities
he
had
the
marvellous
instinctive
sanity
of
the
middle
class
in
than
in
jolyon
with
his
masterful
will
and
his
moments
of
tenderness
and
than
in
swithin
the
martyr
to
the
sufferer
from
roger
the
victim
of
the
true
pulse
of
compromise
of
all
the
brothers
he
was
least
remarkable
in
mind
and
person
and
for
that
reason
more
likely
to
live
for
ever
to
james
more
than
to
any
of
the
others
was
the
family
significant
and
dear
there
had
always
been
something
primitive
and
cosy
in
his
attitude
towards
life
he
loved
the
family
hearth
he
loved
gossip
and
he
loved
grumbling
all
his
decisions
were
formed
of
a
cream
which
he
skimmed
off
the
family
mind
and
through
that
family
off
the
minds
of
thousands
of
other
families
of
similar
fibre
year
after
year
week
after
week
he
went
to
timothy
and
in
his
brother
front
legs
twisted
his
long
white
whiskers
framing
his
sit
watching
the
family
pot
simmer
the
cream
rising
to
the
top
and
he
would
go
away
sheltered
refreshed
comforted
with
an
indefinable
sense
of
comfort
beneath
the
adamant
of
his
instinct
there
was
much
real
softness
in
james
a
visit
to
timothy
was
like
an
hour
spent
in
the
lap
of
a
mother
and
the
deep
craving
he
himself
had
for
the
protection
of
the
family
wing
reacted
in
turn
on
his
feelings
towards
his
own
children
it
was
a
nightmare
to
him
to
think
of
them
exposed
to
the
treatment
of
the
world
in
money
health
or
reputation
when
his
old
friend
john
street
son
volunteered
for
special
service
he
shook
his
head
querulously
and
wondered
what
john
street
was
about
to
allow
it
and
when
young
street
was
assagaied
he
took
it
so
much
to
heart
that
he
made
a
point
of
calling
everywhere
with
the
special
object
of
saying
he
knew
how
it
would
no
patience
with
them
when
his
dartie
had
that
financial
crisis
due
to
speculation
in
oil
shares
james
made
himself
ill
worrying
over
it
the
knell
of
all
prosperity
seemed
to
have
sounded
it
took
him
three
months
and
a
visit
to
to
get
better
there
was
something
terrible
in
the
idea
that
but
for
his
james
money
dartie
name
might
have
appeared
in
the
bankruptcy
list
composed
of
a
physiological
mixture
so
sound
that
if
he
had
an
earache
he
thought
he
was
dying
he
regarded
the
occasional
ailments
of
his
wife
and
children
as
in
the
nature
of
personal
grievances
special
interventions
of
providence
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
his
peace
of
mind
but
he
did
not
believe
at
all
in
the
ailments
of
people
outside
his
own
immediate
family
affirming
them
in
every
case
to
be
due
to
neglected
liver
his
universal
comment
was
what
can
they
expect
i
have
it
myself
if
i
not
careful
when
he
went
to
soames
that
evening
he
felt
that
life
was
hard
on
him
there
was
emily
with
a
bad
toe
and
rachel
gadding
about
in
the
country
he
got
no
sympathy
from
anybody
and
ann
she
was
did
not
believe
she
would
last
through
the
summer
he
had
called
there
three
times
now
without
her
being
able
to
see
him
and
this
idea
of
soames
building
a
house
that
would
have
to
be
looked
into
as
to
the
trouble
with
irene
he
did
know
what
was
to
come
of
might
come
of
it
he
entered
montpellier
square
with
the
fullest
intentions
of
being
miserable
it
was
already
seven
and
irene
dressed
for
dinner
was
seated
in
the
she
was
wearing
her
having
been
displayed
at
a
a
soiree
and
a
dance
it
was
now
to
be
worn
at
she
had
adorned
the
bosom
with
a
cascade
of
lace
on
which
james
eyes
riveted
themselves
at
once
where
do
you
get
your
things
he
said
in
an
aggravated
voice
i
never
see
rachel
and
cicely
looking
half
so
well
that
not
real
irene
came
close
to
prove
to
him
that
he
was
in
error
and
in
spite
of
himself
james
felt
the
influence
of
her
deference
of
the
faint
seductive
perfume
exhaling
from
her
no
forsyte
surrendered
at
a
blow
so
he
merely
said
he
did
expected
she
was
spending
a
pretty
penny
on
dress
the
gong
sounded
and
putting
her
white
arm
within
his
irene
took
him
into
the
she
seated
him
in
soames
usual
place
round
the
corner
on
her
left
the
light
fell
softly
there
so
that
he
would
not
be
worried
by
the
gradual
dying
of
the
day
and
she
began
to
talk
to
him
about
himself
presently
over
james
came
a
change
like
the
mellowing
that
steals
upon
a
fruit
in
the
sun
a
sense
of
being
caressed
and
praised
and
petted
and
all
without
the
bestowal
of
a
single
caress
or
word
of
praise
he
felt
that
what
he
was
eating
was
agreeing
with
him
he
could
not
get
that
feeling
at
home
he
did
not
know
when
he
had
enjoyed
a
glass
of
champagne
so
much
and
on
inquiring
the
brand
and
price
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
one
of
which
he
had
a
large
stock
himself
but
could
never
drink
he
instantly
formed
the
resolution
to
let
his
wine
merchant
know
that
he
had
been
swindled
looking
up
from
his
food
he
remarked
you
a
lot
of
nice
things
about
the
place
now
what
did
you
give
for
that
should
wonder
if
it
was
worth
money
he
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
opposite
which
he
himself
had
given
them
i
no
idea
it
was
so
good
he
said
they
rose
to
go
into
the
and
james
followed
irene
closely
that
what
i
call
a
capital
little
dinner
he
murmured
breathing
pleasantly
down
on
her
shoulder
nothing
not
too
frenchified
but
i
ca
get
it
at
home
i
pay
my
cook
sixty
pounds
a
year
but
she
ca
give
me
a
dinner
like
that
he
had
as
yet
made
no
allusion
to
the
building
of
the
house
nor
did
he
when
soames
pleading
the
excuse
of
business
betook
himself
to
the
room
at
the
top
where
he
kept
his
pictures
james
was
left
alone
with
his
the
glow
of
the
wine
and
of
an
excellent
liqueur
was
still
within
him
he
felt
quite
warm
towards
her
she
was
really
a
taking
little
thing
she
listened
to
you
and
seemed
to
understand
what
you
were
saying
and
while
talking
he
kept
examining
her
figure
from
her
shoes
to
the
waved
gold
of
her
hair
she
was
leaning
back
in
an
empire
chair
her
shoulders
poised
against
the
body
flexibly
straight
and
unsupported
from
the
hips
swaying
when
she
moved
as
though
giving
to
the
arms
of
a
lover
her
lips
were
smiling
her
eyes
it
may
have
been
a
recognition
of
danger
in
the
very
charm
of
her
attitude
or
a
twang
of
digestion
that
caused
a
sudden
dumbness
to
fall
on
james
he
did
not
remember
ever
having
been
quite
alone
with
irene
before
and
as
he
looked
at
her
an
odd
feeling
crept
over
him
as
though
he
had
come
across
something
strange
and
foreign
now
what
was
she
thinking
back
like
that
thus
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
sharper
voice
as
if
he
had
been
awakened
from
a
pleasant
dream
what
do
with
yourself
all
day
he
said
you
never
come
round
to
park
lane
she
seemed
to
be
making
very
lame
excuses
and
james
did
not
look
at
her
he
did
not
want
to
believe
that
she
was
really
avoiding
would
mean
too
much
i
expect
the
fact
is
you
have
time
he
said
you
always
about
with
june
i
expect
you
useful
to
her
with
her
young
man
chaperoning
and
one
thing
and
another
they
tell
me
she
never
at
home
now
your
uncle
jolyon
he
does
like
it
i
fancy
being
left
so
much
alone
as
he
is
they
tell
me
she
always
hanging
about
for
this
young
bosinney
i
suppose
he
comes
here
every
day
now
what
do
you
think
of
him
think
he
knows
his
own
mind
he
seems
to
me
a
poor
thing
i
should
say
the
grey
mare
was
the
better
horse
the
colour
deepened
in
irene
face
and
james
watched
her
suspiciously
perhaps
you
do
quite
understand
bosinney
she
said
do
understand
him
james
hummed
out
why
not
can
see
one
of
these
artistic
chaps
they
say
he
all
think
clever
you
know
more
about
him
than
i
do
he
added
and
again
his
suspicious
glance
rested
on
her
he
is
designing
a
house
for
soames
she
said
softly
evidently
trying
to
smooth
things
over
that
brings
me
to
what
i
was
going
to
say
continued
james
i
know
what
soames
wants
with
a
young
man
like
that
why
does
he
go
to
a
man
perhaps
bosinney
is
james
rose
and
took
a
turn
with
bent
head
that
it
he
said
you
young
people
you
all
stick
together
you
all
think
you
know
best
halting
his
tall
lank
figure
before
her
he
raised
a
finger
and
levelled
it
at
her
bosom
as
though
bringing
an
indictment
against
her
beauty
all
i
can
say
is
these
artistic
people
or
whatever
they
call
themselves
they
as
unreliable
as
they
can
be
and
my
advice
to
you
is
do
you
have
too
much
to
do
with
him
irene
smiled
and
in
the
curve
of
her
lips
was
a
strange
provocation
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
deference
her
breast
rose
and
fell
as
though
with
secret
anger
she
drew
her
hands
inwards
from
their
rest
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
until
the
tips
of
her
fingers
met
and
her
dark
eyes
looked
unfathomably
at
james
the
latter
gloomily
scrutinized
the
floor
i
tell
you
my
opinion
he
said
it
a
pity
you
have
got
a
child
to
think
about
and
occupy
you
a
brooding
look
came
instantly
on
irene
face
and
even
james
became
conscious
of
the
rigidity
that
took
possession
of
her
whole
figure
beneath
the
softness
of
its
silk
and
lace
clothing
he
was
frightened
by
the
effect
he
had
produced
and
like
most
men
with
but
little
courage
he
sought
at
once
to
justify
himself
by
bullying
you
do
seem
to
care
about
going
about
why
do
you
drive
down
to
hurlingham
with
us
and
go
to
the
theatre
now
and
then
at
your
time
of
life
you
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
things
you
a
young
woman
the
brooding
look
darkened
on
her
face
he
grew
nervous
well
i
know
nothing
about
it
he
said
nobody
tells
me
anything
soames
ought
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
if
he
ca
take
care
of
himself
he
must
look
to
biting
the
corner
of
his
forefinger
he
stole
a
cold
sharp
look
at
his
he
encountered
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
own
so
dark
and
deep
that
he
stopped
and
broke
into
a
gentle
perspiration
well
i
must
be
going
he
said
after
a
short
pause
and
a
minute
later
rose
with
a
slight
appearance
of
surprise
as
though
he
had
expected
to
be
asked
to
stop
giving
his
hand
to
irene
he
allowed
himself
to
be
conducted
to
the
door
and
let
out
into
the
street
he
would
not
have
a
cab
he
would
walk
irene
was
to
say
to
soames
for
him
and
if
she
wanted
a
little
gaiety
well
he
would
drive
her
down
to
richmond
any
day
he
walked
home
and
going
upstairs
woke
emily
out
of
the
first
sleep
she
had
had
for
four
and
twenty
hours
to
tell
her
that
it
was
his
impression
things
were
in
a
bad
way
at
soames
on
this
theme
he
descanted
for
half
an
hour
until
at
last
saying
that
he
would
not
sleep
a
wink
he
turned
on
his
side
and
instantly
began
to
snore
in
montpellier
square
soames
who
had
come
from
the
picture
room
stood
invisible
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
watching
irene
sort
the
letters
brought
by
the
last
post
she
turned
back
into
the
but
in
a
minute
came
out
and
stood
as
if
listening
then
she
came
stealing
up
the
stairs
with
a
kitten
in
her
arms
he
could
see
her
face
bent
over
the
little
beast
which
was
purring
against
her
neck
why
could
she
look
at
him
like
that
suddenly
she
saw
him
and
her
face
changed
any
letters
for
me
he
said
he
stood
aside
and
without
another
word
she
passed
on
into
the
bedroom
chapter
jolyon
peccadillo
old
jolyon
came
out
of
lord
cricket
ground
that
same
afternoon
with
the
intention
of
going
home
he
had
not
reached
hamilton
terrace
before
he
changed
his
mind
and
hailing
a
cab
gave
the
driver
an
address
in
wistaria
avenue
he
had
taken
a
resolution
june
had
hardly
been
at
home
at
all
that
week
she
had
given
him
nothing
of
her
company
for
a
long
time
past
not
in
fact
since
she
had
become
engaged
to
bosinney
he
never
asked
her
for
her
company
it
was
not
his
habit
to
ask
people
for
things
she
had
just
that
one
idea
and
his
she
left
him
stranded
in
his
great
house
with
a
parcel
of
servants
and
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
from
morning
to
night
his
club
was
closed
for
cleaning
his
boards
in
recess
there
was
nothing
therefore
to
take
him
into
the
city
june
had
wanted
him
to
go
away
she
would
not
go
herself
because
bosinney
was
in
london
but
where
was
he
to
go
by
himself
he
could
not
go
abroad
alone
the
sea
upset
his
liver
he
hated
hotels
roger
went
to
a
was
not
going
to
begin
that
at
his
time
of
life
those
places
all
humbug
with
such
formulas
he
clothed
to
himself
the
desolation
of
his
spirit
the
lines
down
his
face
deepening
his
eyes
day
by
day
looking
forth
with
the
melancholy
which
sat
so
strangely
on
a
face
wont
to
be
strong
and
serene
and
so
that
afternoon
he
took
this
journey
through
john
wood
in
the
that
sprinkled
the
rounded
green
bushes
of
the
before
the
little
houses
in
the
summer
sunshine
that
seemed
holding
a
revel
over
the
little
gardens
and
he
looked
about
him
with
interest
for
this
was
a
district
which
no
forsyte
entered
without
open
disapproval
and
secret
curiosity
his
cab
stopped
in
front
of
a
small
house
of
that
peculiar
buff
colour
which
implies
a
long
immunity
from
paint
it
had
an
outer
gate
and
a
rustic
approach
he
stepped
out
his
bearing
extremely
composed
his
massive
head
with
its
drooping
moustache
and
wings
of
white
hair
very
upright
under
an
excessively
large
top
hat
his
glance
firm
a
little
angry
he
had
been
driven
into
this
mrs
jolyon
forsyte
at
home
oh
yes
sir
name
shall
i
say
if
you
please
sir
old
jolyon
could
not
help
twinkling
at
the
little
maid
as
he
gave
his
name
she
seemed
to
him
such
a
funny
little
toad
and
he
followed
her
through
the
dark
hall
into
a
small
double
where
the
furniture
was
covered
in
chintz
and
the
little
maid
placed
him
in
a
chair
they
all
in
the
garden
sir
if
you
kindly
take
a
seat
i
tell
old
jolyon
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
looked
around
him
the
whole
place
seemed
to
him
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
pokey
there
was
a
could
not
tell
exactly
of
shabbiness
or
rather
of
making
two
ends
meet
about
everything
as
far
as
he
could
see
not
a
single
piece
of
furniture
was
worth
a
note
the
walls
distempered
rather
a
long
time
ago
were
decorated
with
sketches
across
the
ceiling
meandered
a
long
crack
these
little
houses
were
all
old
concerns
he
should
hope
the
rent
was
under
a
hundred
a
year
it
hurt
him
more
than
he
could
have
said
to
think
of
a
own
son
living
in
such
a
place
the
little
maid
came
back
would
he
please
to
go
down
into
the
garden
old
jolyon
marched
out
through
the
french
windows
in
descending
the
steps
he
noticed
that
they
wanted
painting
young
jolyon
his
wife
his
two
children
and
his
dog
balthasar
were
all
out
there
under
a
this
walk
towards
them
was
the
most
courageous
act
of
old
jolyon
life
but
no
muscle
of
his
face
moved
no
nervous
gesture
betrayed
him
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
on
the
enemy
in
those
two
minutes
he
demonstrated
to
perfection
all
that
unconscious
soundness
balance
and
vitality
of
fibre
that
made
of
him
and
so
many
others
of
his
class
the
core
of
the
nation
in
the
unostentatious
conduct
of
their
own
affairs
to
the
neglect
of
everything
else
they
typified
the
essential
individualism
born
in
the
briton
from
the
natural
isolation
of
his
country
life
the
dog
balthasar
sniffed
round
the
edges
of
his
trousers
this
friendly
and
cynical
of
a
liaison
between
a
russian
poodle
and
a
a
nose
for
the
unusual
the
strange
greetings
over
old
jolyon
seated
himself
in
a
wicker
chair
and
his
two
grandchildren
one
on
each
side
of
his
knees
looked
at
him
silently
never
having
seen
so
old
a
man
they
were
unlike
as
though
recognising
the
difference
set
between
them
by
the
circumstances
of
their
births
jolly
the
child
of
sin
with
his
hair
brushed
off
his
forehead
and
a
dimple
in
his
chin
had
an
air
of
stubborn
amiability
and
the
eyes
of
a
forsyte
little
holly
the
child
of
wedlock
was
a
solemn
soul
with
her
mother
grey
and
wistful
eyes
the
dog
balthasar
having
walked
round
the
three
small
to
show
his
extreme
contempt
for
things
at
large
had
also
taken
a
seat
in
front
of
old
jolyon
and
oscillating
a
tail
curled
by
nature
tightly
over
his
back
was
staring
up
with
eyes
that
did
not
blink
even
in
the
garden
that
sense
of
things
being
pokey
haunted
old
jolyon
the
wicker
chair
creaked
under
his
weight
the
looked
on
the
far
side
under
the
wall
cats
had
made
a
path
while
he
and
his
grandchildren
thus
regarded
each
other
with
the
peculiar
scrutiny
curious
yet
trustful
that
passes
between
the
very
young
and
the
very
old
young
jolyon
watched
his
wife
the
colour
had
deepened
in
her
thin
oval
face
with
its
straight
brows
and
large
grey
eyes
her
hair
brushed
in
fine
high
curves
back
from
her
forehead
was
going
grey
like
his
own
and
this
greyness
made
the
sudden
vivid
colour
in
her
cheeks
painfully
pathetic
the
look
on
her
face
such
as
he
had
never
seen
there
before
such
as
she
had
always
hidden
from
him
was
full
of
secret
resentments
and
longings
and
fears
her
eyes
under
their
twitching
brows
stared
painfully
and
she
was
silent
jolly
alone
sustained
the
conversation
he
had
many
possessions
and
was
anxious
that
his
unknown
friend
with
extremely
large
moustaches
and
hands
all
covered
with
blue
veins
who
sat
with
legs
crossed
like
his
own
father
a
habit
he
was
himself
trying
to
acquire
should
know
it
but
being
a
forsyte
though
not
yet
quite
eight
years
old
he
made
no
mention
of
the
thing
at
the
moment
dearest
to
his
camp
of
soldiers
in
a
which
his
father
had
promised
to
buy
no
doubt
it
seemed
to
him
too
precious
a
tempting
of
providence
to
mention
it
yet
and
the
sunlight
played
through
the
leaves
on
that
little
party
of
the
three
generations
grouped
tranquilly
under
the
which
had
long
borne
no
fruit
old
jolyon
furrowed
face
was
reddening
patchily
as
old
men
faces
redden
in
the
sun
he
took
one
of
jolly
hands
in
his
own
the
boy
climbed
on
to
his
knee
and
little
holly
mesmerized
by
this
sight
crept
up
to
them
the
sound
of
the
dog
balthasar
scratching
arose
rhythmically
suddenly
young
jolyon
got
up
and
hurried
indoors
a
minute
later
her
husband
muttered
an
excuse
and
followed
old
jolyon
was
left
alone
with
his
grandchildren
and
nature
with
her
quaint
irony
began
working
in
him
one
of
her
strange
revolutions
following
her
cyclic
laws
into
the
depths
of
his
heart
and
that
tenderness
for
little
children
that
passion
for
the
beginnings
of
life
which
had
once
made
him
forsake
his
son
and
follow
june
now
worked
in
him
to
forsake
june
and
follow
these
littler
things
youth
like
a
flame
burned
ever
in
his
breast
and
to
youth
he
turned
to
the
round
little
limbs
so
reckless
that
wanted
care
to
the
small
round
faces
so
unreasonably
solemn
or
bright
to
the
treble
tongues
and
the
shrill
chuckling
laughter
to
the
insistent
tugging
hands
and
the
feel
of
small
bodies
against
his
legs
to
all
that
was
young
and
young
and
once
more
young
and
his
eyes
grew
soft
his
voice
and
hands
soft
and
soft
his
heart
within
him
and
to
those
small
creatures
he
became
at
once
a
place
of
pleasure
a
place
where
they
were
secure
and
could
talk
and
laugh
and
play
till
like
sunshine
there
radiated
from
old
jolyon
wicker
chair
the
perfect
gaiety
of
three
hearts
but
with
young
jolyon
following
to
his
wife
room
it
was
different
he
found
her
seated
on
a
chair
before
her
with
her
hands
before
her
face
her
shoulders
were
shaking
with
sobs
this
passion
of
hers
for
suffering
was
mysterious
to
him
he
had
been
through
a
hundred
of
these
moods
how
he
had
survived
them
he
never
knew
for
he
could
never
believe
they
were
moods
and
that
the
last
hour
of
his
partnership
had
not
struck
in
the
night
she
would
be
sure
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
say
oh
jo
how
i
make
you
suffer
as
she
had
done
a
hundred
times
before
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
unseen
slipped
his
into
his
pocket
can
not
stay
here
he
thought
must
go
down
without
a
word
he
left
the
room
and
went
back
to
the
lawn
old
jolyon
had
little
holly
on
his
knee
she
had
taken
possession
of
his
watch
jolly
very
red
in
the
face
was
trying
to
show
that
he
could
stand
on
his
head
the
dog
balthasar
as
close
as
he
might
be
to
the
had
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
cake
young
jolyon
felt
a
malicious
desire
to
cut
their
enjoyment
short
what
business
had
his
father
to
come
and
upset
his
wife
like
this
it
was
a
shock
after
all
these
years
he
ought
to
have
known
he
ought
to
have
given
them
warning
but
when
did
a
forsyte
ever
imagine
that
his
conduct
could
upset
anybody
and
in
his
thoughts
he
did
old
jolyon
wrong
he
spoke
sharply
to
the
children
and
told
them
to
go
in
to
their
tea
greatly
surprised
for
they
had
never
heard
their
father
speak
sharply
before
they
went
off
hand
in
hand
little
holly
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
young
jolyon
poured
out
the
tea
my
wife
not
the
thing
today
he
said
but
he
knew
well
enough
that
his
father
had
penetrated
the
cause
of
that
sudden
withdrawal
and
almost
hated
the
old
man
for
sitting
there
so
calmly
you
got
a
nice
little
house
here
said
old
jolyon
with
a
shrewd
look
i
suppose
you
taken
a
lease
of
it
young
jolyon
nodded
i
do
like
the
neighbourhood
said
old
jolyon
a
ramshackle
young
jolyon
replied
yes
we
a
ramshackle
lot
the
silence
was
now
only
broken
by
the
sound
of
the
dog
scratching
old
jolyon
said
simply
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
come
here
jo
but
i
get
so
lonely
at
these
words
young
jolyon
got
up
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
in
the
next
house
someone
was
playing
over
and
over
again
donna
mobile
on
an
untuned
piano
and
the
little
garden
had
fallen
into
shade
the
sun
now
only
reached
the
wall
at
the
end
whereon
basked
a
crouching
cat
her
yellow
eyes
turned
sleepily
down
on
the
dog
balthasar
there
was
a
drowsy
hum
of
very
distant
traffic
the
creepered
trellis
round
the
garden
shut
out
everything
but
sky
and
house
and
with
its
top
branches
still
gilded
by
the
sun
for
some
time
they
sat
there
talking
but
little
then
old
jolyon
rose
to
go
and
not
a
word
was
said
about
his
coming
again
he
walked
away
very
sadly
what
a
poor
miserable
place
and
he
thought
of
the
great
empty
house
in
stanhope
gate
fit
residence
for
a
forsyte
with
its
huge
and
that
no
one
entered
from
one
week
end
to
another
that
woman
whose
face
he
had
rather
liked
was
too
by
half
she
gave
jo
a
bad
time
he
knew
and
those
sweet
children
ah
what
a
piece
of
awful
folly
he
walked
towards
the
edgware
road
between
rows
of
little
houses
all
suggesting
to
him
erroneously
no
doubt
but
the
prejudices
of
a
forsyte
are
sacred
shady
histories
of
some
sort
or
kind
society
forsooth
the
chattering
hags
and
set
themselves
up
to
pass
judgment
on
his
flesh
and
blood
a
parcel
of
old
women
he
stumped
his
umbrella
on
the
ground
as
though
to
drive
it
into
the
heart
of
that
unfortunate
body
which
had
dared
to
ostracize
his
son
and
his
son
son
in
whom
he
could
have
lived
again
he
stumped
his
umbrella
fiercely
yet
he
himself
had
followed
behaviour
for
fifteen
only
today
been
false
to
it
he
thought
of
june
and
her
dead
mother
and
the
whole
story
with
all
his
old
bitterness
a
wretched
business
he
was
a
long
time
reaching
stanhope
gate
for
with
native
perversity
being
extremely
tired
he
walked
the
whole
way
after
washing
his
hands
in
the
lavatory
downstairs
he
went
to
the
to
wait
for
dinner
the
only
room
he
used
when
june
was
was
less
lonely
so
the
evening
paper
had
not
yet
come
he
had
finished
the
times
there
was
therefore
nothing
to
do
the
room
faced
the
backwater
of
traffic
and
was
very
silent
he
disliked
dogs
but
a
dog
even
would
have
been
company
his
gaze
travelling
round
the
walls
rested
on
a
picture
entitled
of
dutch
fishing
boats
at
sunset
the
chef
of
his
collection
it
gave
him
no
pleasure
he
closed
his
eyes
he
was
lonely
he
to
complain
he
knew
but
he
could
help
it
he
was
a
poor
always
been
a
poor
pluck
such
was
his
thought
the
butler
came
to
lay
the
table
for
dinner
and
seeing
his
master
apparently
asleep
exercised
extreme
caution
in
his
movements
this
bearded
man
also
wore
a
moustache
which
had
given
rise
to
grave
doubts
in
the
minds
of
many
the
especially
those
who
like
soames
had
been
to
public
schools
and
were
accustomed
to
niceness
in
such
matters
could
he
really
be
considered
a
butler
playful
spirits
alluded
to
him
as
jolyon
nonconformist
george
the
acknowledged
wag
had
named
him
he
moved
to
and
fro
between
the
great
polished
sideboard
and
the
great
polished
table
inimitably
sleek
and
soft
old
jolyon
watched
him
feigning
sleep
the
fellow
was
a
had
always
thought
cared
about
nothing
but
rattling
through
his
work
and
getting
out
to
his
betting
or
his
woman
or
goodness
knew
what
a
slug
fat
too
and
did
care
a
pin
about
his
master
but
then
against
his
will
came
one
of
those
moments
of
philosophy
which
made
old
jolyon
different
from
other
forsytes
after
all
why
should
the
man
care
he
was
paid
to
care
and
why
expect
it
in
this
world
people
could
look
for
affection
unless
they
paid
for
it
it
might
be
different
in
the
did
tell
and
again
he
shut
his
eyes
relentless
and
stealthy
the
butler
pursued
his
labours
taking
things
from
the
various
compartments
of
the
sideboard
his
back
seemed
always
turned
to
old
jolyon
thus
he
robbed
his
operations
of
the
unseemliness
of
being
carried
on
in
his
master
presence
now
and
then
he
furtively
breathed
on
the
silver
and
wiped
it
with
a
piece
of
chamois
leather
he
appeared
to
pore
over
the
quantities
of
wine
in
the
decanters
which
he
carried
carefully
and
rather
high
letting
his
head
droop
over
them
protectingly
when
he
had
finished
he
stood
for
over
a
minute
watching
his
master
and
in
his
greenish
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
contempt
after
all
this
master
of
his
was
an
old
buffer
who
had
much
left
in
him
soft
as
a
he
crossed
the
room
to
press
the
bell
his
orders
were
at
seven
what
if
his
master
were
asleep
he
would
soon
have
him
out
of
that
there
was
the
night
to
sleep
in
he
had
himself
to
think
of
for
he
was
due
at
his
club
at
eight
in
answer
to
the
ring
appeared
a
page
boy
with
a
silver
soup
tureen
the
butler
took
it
from
his
hands
and
placed
it
on
the
table
then
standing
by
the
open
door
as
though
about
to
usher
company
into
the
room
he
said
in
a
solemn
voice
dinner
is
on
the
table
sir
slowly
old
jolyon
got
up
out
of
his
chair
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
eat
his
dinner
chapter
of
the
house
forsytes
as
is
generally
admitted
have
shells
like
that
extremely
useful
little
animal
which
is
made
into
turkish
delight
in
other
words
they
are
never
seen
or
if
seen
would
not
be
recognised
without
habitats
composed
of
circumstance
property
acquaintances
and
wives
which
seem
to
move
along
with
them
in
their
passage
through
a
world
composed
of
thousands
of
other
forsytes
with
their
habitats
without
a
habitat
a
forsyte
is
would
be
like
a
novel
without
a
plot
which
is
to
be
an
anomaly
to
forsyte
eyes
bosinney
appeared
to
have
no
habitat
he
seemed
one
of
those
rare
and
unfortunate
men
who
go
through
life
surrounded
by
circumstance
property
acquaintances
and
wives
that
do
not
belong
to
them

not

no
apart
from

a

june
had
twice
been
to
tea
there
under
the
chaperonage
of
his
aunt
he
was
believed
to
have
a
bedroom
at
the
back
as
far
as
the
family
had
been
able
to
ascertain
his
income
it
consisted
of
two
consulting
appointments
at
twenty
pounds
a
year
together
with
an
odd
fee
once
in
a
way
worthy
private
annuity
under
his
father
will
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
what
had
transpired
concerning
that
father
was
not
so
reassuring
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
a
lincolnshire
country
doctor
of
cornish
extraction
striking
appearance
and
byronic
figure
in
fact
in
his
county
bosinney
uncle
by
marriage
baynes
of
baynes
and
bildeboy
a
forsyte
in
instincts
if
not
in
name
had
but
little
that
was
worthy
to
relate
of
his
an
odd
fellow
he
would
say
spoke
of
his
three
eldest
boys
as
creatures
but
so
dull
they
all
doing
capitally
in
the
indian
civil
philip
was
the
only
one
he
liked
i
heard
him
talk
in
the
queerest
way
he
once
said
to
me
dear
fellow
never
let
your
poor
wife
know
what
you
thinking
of
but
i
did
follow
his
advice
not
i
an
eccentric
man
he
would
say
to
phil
you
live
like
a
gentleman
or
not
my
boy
be
sure
you
die
like
one
and
he
had
himself
embalmed
in
a
frock
coat
suit
with
a
satin
cravat
and
a
diamond
pin
oh
quite
an
original
i
can
assure
you
of
bosinney
himself
baynes
would
speak
warmly
with
a
certain
compassion
he
got
a
streak
of
his
father
byronism
why
look
at
the
way
he
threw
up
his
chances
when
he
left
my
office
going
off
like
that
for
six
months
with
a
knapsack
and
all
for
what
study
foreign
what
could
he
expect
and
there
he
clever
young
make
his
hundred
a
year
now
this
engagement
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
him
steady
he
one
of
those
that
go
to
bed
all
day
and
stay
up
all
night
simply
because
they
no
method
but
no
vice
about
an
ounce
of
vice
old
forsyte
a
rich
man
baynes
made
himself
extremely
pleasant
to
june
who
frequently
visited
his
house
in
lowndes
square
at
this
period
this
house
of
your
a
capital
man
of
the
very
thing
for
philip
he
would
say
to
her
you
must
expect
to
see
too
much
of
him
just
now
my
dear
young
lady
the
good
good
cause
the
young
man
must
make
his
way
when
i
was
his
age
i
was
at
work
day
and
night
my
dear
wife
used
to
say
to
me
do
work
too
hard
think
of
your
health
but
i
never
spared
myself
june
had
complained
that
her
lover
found
no
time
to
come
to
stanhope
gate
the
first
time
he
came
again
they
had
not
been
together
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
by
one
of
those
coincidences
of
which
she
was
a
mistress
septimus
small
arrived
thereon
bosinney
rose
and
hid
himself
according
to
previous
arrangement
in
the
little
study
to
wait
for
her
departure
my
dear
said
aunt
juley
how
thin
he
is
i
often
noticed
it
with
engaged
people
but
you
must
let
it
get
worse
there
extract
of
veal
it
did
your
uncle
swithin
a
lot
of
june
her
little
figure
erect
before
the
hearth
her
small
face
quivering
grimly
for
she
regarded
her
aunt
untimely
visit
in
the
light
of
a
personal
injury
replied
with
scorn
it
because
he
busy
people
who
can
do
anything
worth
doing
are
never
fat
aunt
juley
pouted
she
herself
had
always
been
thin
but
the
only
pleasure
she
derived
from
the
fact
was
the
opportunity
of
longing
to
be
stouter
i
do
think
she
said
mournfully
that
you
ought
to
let
them
call
him
buccaneer
people
might
think
it
odd
now
that
he
going
to
build
a
house
for
soames
i
do
hope
he
will
be
careful
it
so
important
for
him
soames
has
such
good
taste
taste
cried
june
flaring
up
at
once
would
give
that
for
his
taste
or
any
of
the
family
small
was
taken
aback
your
uncle
swithin
she
said
always
had
beautiful
taste
and
soames
little
house
is
lovely
you
do
mean
to
say
you
do
think
so
said
june
that
only
because
irene
there
aunt
juley
tried
to
say
something
pleasant
and
how
will
dear
irene
like
living
in
the
country
june
gazed
at
her
intently
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
her
conscience
had
suddenly
leaped
up
into
them
it
passed
and
an
even
more
intent
look
took
its
place
as
if
she
had
stared
that
conscience
out
of
countenance
she
replied
imperiously
of
course
she
like
it
why
should
she
small
grew
nervous
i
did
know
she
said
i
thought
she
might
like
to
leave
her
friends
your
uncle
james
says
she
does
take
enough
interest
in
life
we
mean
timothy
ought
to
go
out
more
i
expect
miss
her
very
much
june
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
neck
i
do
wish
she
cried
uncle
timothy
would
talk
about
what
concern
him
aunt
juley
rose
to
the
full
height
of
her
tall
figure
he
never
talks
about
what
does
concern
him
she
said
june
was
instantly
compunctious
she
ran
to
her
aunt
and
kissed
her
i
very
sorry
auntie
but
i
wish
they
let
irene
aunt
juley
unable
to
think
of
anything
further
on
the
subject
that
would
be
suitable
was
silent
she
prepared
for
departure
hooking
her
black
silk
cape
across
her
chest
and
taking
up
her
green
reticule
and
how
is
your
dear
grandfather
she
asked
in
the
hall
i
expect
he
very
lonely
now
that
all
your
time
is
taken
up
with
she
bent
and
kissed
her
niece
hungrily
and
with
little
mincing
steps
passed
away
the
tears
sprang
up
in
june
eyes
running
into
the
little
study
where
bosinney
was
sitting
at
the
table
drawing
birds
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
she
sank
down
by
his
side
and
cried
oh
phil
it
all
so
horrid
her
heart
was
as
warm
as
the
colour
of
her
hair
on
the
following
sunday
morning
while
soames
was
shaving
a
message
was
brought
him
to
the
effect
that
bosinney
was
below
and
would
be
glad
to
see
him
opening
the
door
into
his
wife
room
he
said
bosinney
downstairs
just
go
and
entertain
him
while
i
finish
shaving
i
be
down
in
a
minute
it
about
the
plans
i
irene
looked
at
him
without
reply
put
the
finishing
touch
to
her
dress
and
went
downstairs
he
could
not
make
her
out
about
this
house
she
had
said
nothing
against
it
and
as
far
as
bosinney
was
concerned
seemed
friendly
enough
from
the
window
of
his
he
could
see
them
talking
together
in
the
little
court
below
he
hurried
on
with
his
shaving
cutting
his
chin
twice
he
heard
them
laugh
and
thought
to
himself
well
they
get
on
all
right
anyway
as
he
expected
bosinney
had
come
round
to
fetch
him
to
look
at
the
plans
he
took
his
hat
and
went
over
the
plans
were
spread
on
the
oak
table
in
the
architect
room
and
pale
imperturbable
inquiring
soames
bent
over
them
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
he
said
at
last
in
a
puzzled
voice
it
an
odd
sort
of
house
a
rectangular
house
of
two
stories
was
designed
in
a
quadrangle
round
a
court
this
court
encircled
by
a
gallery
on
the
upper
floor
was
roofed
with
a
glass
roof
supported
by
eight
columns
running
up
from
the
ground
it
was
indeed
to
forsyte
eyes
an
odd
house
there
a
lot
of
room
cut
to
waste
pursued
soames
bosinney
began
to
walk
about
and
soames
did
not
like
the
expression
on
his
face
the
principle
of
this
house
said
the
architect
was
that
you
should
have
room
to
a
gentleman
soames
extended
his
finger
and
thumb
as
if
measuring
the
extent
of
the
distinction
he
should
acquire
and
replied
oh
yes
i
the
peculiar
look
came
into
bosinney
face
which
marked
all
his
enthusiasms
i
tried
to
plan
you
a
house
here
with
some
of
its
own
if
you
do
like
it
you
better
say
so
it
certainly
the
last
thing
to
be
wants
in
a
house
when
you
can
squeeze
in
an
extra
lavatory
he
put
his
finger
suddenly
down
on
the
left
division
of
the
centre
oblong
you
can
swing
a
cat
here
this
is
for
your
pictures
divided
from
this
court
by
curtains
draw
them
back
and
you
have
a
space
of
by
six
this
stove
in
the
centre
here
looks
one
way
towards
the
court
one
way
towards
the
picture
room
this
end
wall
is
all
window
you
a
southeast
light
from
that
a
north
light
from
the
court
the
rest
of
your
pictures
you
can
hang
round
the
gallery
upstairs
or
in
the
other
in
architecture
he
went
though
looking
at
soames
he
did
not
seem
to
see
him
which
gave
soames
an
unpleasant
as
in
life
you
get
no
without
regularity
fellows
tell
you
that
old
fashioned
it
appears
to
be
peculiar
any
way
it
never
occurs
to
us
to
embody
the
main
principle
of
life
in
our
buildings
we
load
our
houses
with
decoration
gimcracks
corners
anything
to
distract
the
eye
on
the
contrary
the
eye
should
rest
get
your
effects
with
a
few
strong
lines
the
whole
thing
is
regularity
there
no
without
soames
the
unconscious
ironist
fixed
his
gaze
on
bosinney
tie
which
was
far
from
being
in
the
perpendicular
he
was
unshaven
too
and
his
dress
not
remarkable
for
order
architecture
appeared
to
have
exhausted
his
regularity
wo
it
look
like
a
barrack
he
inquired
he
did
not
at
once
receive
a
reply
i
can
see
what
it
is
said
bosinney
you
want
one
of
of
the
pretty
and
commodious
sort
where
the
servants
will
live
in
garrets
and
the
front
door
be
sunk
so
that
you
may
come
up
again
by
all
means
try
littlemaster
you
find
him
a
capital
fellow
i
known
him
all
my
life
soames
was
alarmed
he
had
really
been
struck
by
the
plans
and
the
concealment
of
his
satisfaction
had
been
merely
instinctive
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
pay
a
compliment
he
despised
people
who
were
lavish
with
their
praises
he
found
himself
now
in
the
embarrassing
position
of
one
who
must
pay
a
compliment
or
run
the
risk
of
losing
a
good
thing
bosinney
was
just
the
fellow
who
might
tear
up
the
plans
and
refuse
to
act
for
him
a
kind
of
child
this
childishness
to
which
he
felt
so
superior
exercised
a
peculiar
and
almost
mesmeric
effect
on
soames
for
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
it
in
himself
well
he
stammered
at
last
certainly
he
had
such
a
private
distrust
and
even
dislike
of
the
word
that
he
felt
he
had
not
really
given
himself
away
by
this
remark
bosinney
seemed
pleased
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
please
a
fellow
like
that
and
his
success
encouraged
soames
big
place
he
said
space
air
light
he
heard
bosinney
murmur
you
ca
live
like
a
gentleman
in
one
of
builds
for
soames
made
a
deprecating
movement
he
had
been
identified
with
a
gentleman
not
for
a
good
deal
of
money
now
would
he
be
classed
with
manufacturers
but
his
innate
distrust
of
general
principles
revived
what
the
deuce
was
the
good
of
talking
about
regularity
and
it
looked
to
him
as
if
the
house
would
be
cold
irene
ca
stand
the
cold
he
said
ah
said
bosinney
sarcastically
your
wife
she
does
like
the
cold
i
see
to
that
she
sha
be
cold
look
here
he
pointed
to
four
marks
at
regular
intervals
on
the
walls
of
the
court
i
given
you
pipes
in
aluminium
casings
you
can
get
them
with
very
good
soames
looked
suspiciously
at
these
marks
it
all
very
well
all
this
he
said
but
what
it
going
to
cost
the
architect
took
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
the
house
of
course
should
be
built
entirely
of
stone
but
as
i
thought
you
would
stand
that
i
compromised
for
a
facing
it
ought
to
have
a
copper
roof
but
i
made
it
green
slate
as
it
is
including
metal
work
it
cost
you
eight
thousand
five
eight
thousand
five
hundred
said
soames
why
i
gave
you
an
outside
limit
of
eight
ca
be
done
for
a
penny
less
replied
bosinney
coolly
you
must
take
it
or
leave
it
it
was
the
only
way
probably
that
such
a
proposition
could
have
been
made
to
soames
he
was
nonplussed
conscience
told
him
to
throw
the
whole
thing
up
but
the
design
was
good
and
he
knew
was
completeness
about
it
and
dignity
the
servants
apartments
were
excellent
too
he
would
gain
credit
by
living
in
a
house
like
such
individual
features
yet
perfectly
he
continued
poring
over
the
plans
while
bosinney
went
into
his
bedroom
to
shave
and
dress
the
two
walked
back
to
montpellier
square
in
silence
soames
watching
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
buccaneer
was
rather
a
he
he
was
properly
got
up
irene
was
bending
over
her
flowers
when
the
two
men
came
in
she
spoke
of
sending
across
the
park
to
fetch
june
no
no
said
soames
we
still
got
business
to
talk
over
at
lunch
he
was
almost
cordial
and
kept
pressing
bosinney
to
eat
he
was
pleased
to
see
the
architect
in
such
high
spirits
and
left
him
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
irene
while
he
stole
off
to
his
pictures
after
his
sunday
habit
at
he
came
down
to
the
and
found
them
talking
as
he
expressed
it
nineteen
to
the
dozen
unobserved
in
the
doorway
he
congratulated
himself
that
things
were
taking
the
right
turn
it
was
lucky
she
and
bosinney
got
on
she
seemed
to
be
falling
into
line
with
the
idea
of
the
new
house
quiet
meditation
among
his
pictures
had
decided
him
to
spring
the
five
hundred
if
necessary
but
he
hoped
that
the
afternoon
might
have
softened
bosinney
estimates
it
was
so
purely
a
matter
which
bosinney
could
remedy
if
he
liked
there
must
be
a
dozen
ways
in
which
he
could
cheapen
the
production
of
a
house
without
spoiling
the
effect
he
awaited
therefore
his
opportunity
till
irene
was
handing
the
architect
his
first
cup
of
tea
a
chink
of
sunshine
through
the
lace
of
the
blinds
warmed
her
cheek
shone
in
the
gold
of
her
hair
and
in
her
soft
eyes
possibly
the
same
gleam
deepened
bosinney
colour
gave
the
rather
startled
look
to
his
face
soames
hated
sunshine
and
he
at
once
got
up
to
draw
the
blind
then
he
took
his
own
cup
of
tea
from
his
wife
and
said
more
coldly
than
he
had
intended
ca
you
see
your
way
to
do
it
for
eight
thousand
after
all
there
must
be
a
lot
of
little
things
you
could
bosinney
drank
off
his
tea
at
a
gulp
put
down
his
cup
and
answered
not
one
soames
saw
that
his
suggestion
had
touched
some
unintelligible
point
of
personal
vanity
well
he
agreed
with
sulky
resignation
you
must
have
it
your
own
way
i
a
few
minutes
later
bosinney
rose
to
go
and
soames
rose
too
to
see
him
off
the
premises
the
architect
seemed
in
absurdly
high
spirits
after
watching
him
walk
away
at
a
swinging
pace
soames
returned
moodily
to
the
where
irene
was
putting
away
the
music
and
moved
by
an
uncontrollable
spasm
of
curiosity
he
asked
well
what
do
you
think
of
he
looked
at
the
carpet
while
waiting
for
her
answer
and
he
had
to
wait
some
time
i
do
know
she
said
at
last
do
you
think
he
irene
smiled
and
it
seemed
to
soames
that
she
was
mocking
him
yes
she
answered
chapter
of
aunt
ann
there
came
a
morning
at
the
end
of
september
when
aunt
ann
was
unable
to
take
from
smither
hands
the
insignia
of
personal
dignity
after
one
look
at
the
old
face
the
doctor
hurriedly
sent
for
announced
that
miss
forsyte
had
passed
away
in
her
sleep
aunts
juley
and
hester
were
overwhelmed
by
the
shock
they
had
never
imagined
such
an
ending
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
had
ever
realized
that
an
ending
was
bound
to
come
secretly
they
felt
it
unreasonable
of
ann
to
have
left
them
like
this
without
a
word
without
even
a
struggle
it
was
unlike
her
perhaps
what
really
affected
them
so
profoundly
was
the
thought
that
a
forsyte
should
have
let
go
her
grasp
on
life
if
one
then
why
not
all
it
was
a
full
hour
before
they
could
make
up
their
minds
to
tell
timothy
if
only
it
could
be
kept
from
him
if
only
it
could
be
broken
to
him
by
degrees
and
long
they
stood
outside
his
door
whispering
together
and
when
it
was
over
they
whispered
together
again
he
would
feel
it
more
they
were
afraid
as
time
went
on
still
he
had
taken
it
better
than
could
have
been
expected
he
would
keep
his
bed
of
course
they
separated
crying
quietly
aunt
juley
stayed
in
her
room
prostrated
by
the
blow
her
face
discoloured
by
tears
was
divided
into
compartments
by
the
little
ridges
of
pouting
flesh
which
had
swollen
with
emotion
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
of
life
without
ann
who
had
lived
with
her
for
years
broken
only
by
the
short
interregnum
of
her
married
life
which
seemed
now
so
unreal
at
fixed
intervals
she
went
to
her
drawer
and
took
from
beneath
the
lavender
bags
a
fresh
her
warm
heart
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
ann
was
lying
there
so
cold
aunt
hester
the
silent
the
patient
that
backwater
of
the
family
energy
sat
in
the
where
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
she
too
had
wept
at
first
but
quietly
without
visible
effect
her
guiding
principle
the
conservation
of
energy
did
not
abandon
her
in
sorrow
she
sat
slim
motionless
studying
the
grate
her
hands
idle
in
the
lap
of
her
black
silk
dress
they
would
want
to
rouse
her
into
doing
something
no
doubt
as
if
there
were
any
good
in
that
doing
something
would
not
bring
back
ann
why
worry
her
five
brought
three
of
the
brothers
jolyon
and
james
and
swithin
nicholas
was
at
yarmouth
and
roger
had
a
bad
attack
of
gout
hayman
had
been
by
herself
earlier
in
the
day
and
after
seeing
ann
had
gone
away
leaving
a
message
for
was
kept
from
she
ought
to
have
been
told
sooner
in
fact
there
was
a
feeling
amongst
them
all
that
they
ought
to
have
been
told
sooner
as
though
they
had
missed
something
and
james
said
i
knew
how
it
be
i
told
you
she
would
last
through
the
aunt
hester
made
no
reply
it
was
nearly
october
but
what
was
the
good
of
arguing
some
people
were
never
satisfied
she
sent
up
to
tell
her
sister
that
the
brothers
were
there
small
came
down
at
once
she
had
bathed
her
face
which
was
still
swollen
and
though
she
looked
severely
at
swithin
trousers
for
they
were
of
light
had
come
straight
from
the
club
where
the
news
had
reached
wore
a
more
cheerful
expression
than
usual
the
instinct
for
doing
the
wrong
thing
being
even
now
too
strong
for
her
presently
all
five
went
up
to
look
at
the
body
under
the
pure
white
sheet
a
quilted
had
been
placed
for
now
more
than
ever
aunt
ann
had
need
of
warmth
and
the
pillows
removed
her
spine
and
head
rested
flat
with
the
semblance
of
their
inflexibility
the
coif
banding
the
top
of
her
brow
was
drawn
on
either
side
to
the
level
of
the
ears
and
between
it
and
the
sheet
her
face
almost
as
white
was
turned
with
closed
eyes
to
the
faces
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
its
extraordinary
peace
the
face
was
stronger
than
ever
nearly
all
bone
now
under
the
parchment
of
jaw
and
chin
cheekbones
forehead
with
hollow
temples
chiselled
fortress
of
an
unconquerable
spirit
that
had
yielded
to
death
and
in
its
upward
sightlessness
seemed
trying
to
regain
that
spirit
to
regain
the
guardianship
it
had
just
laid
down
swithin
took
but
one
look
at
the
face
and
left
the
room
the
sight
he
said
afterwards
made
him
very
queer
he
went
downstairs
shaking
the
whole
house
and
seizing
his
hat
clambered
into
his
brougham
without
giving
any
directions
to
the
coachman
he
was
driven
home
and
all
the
evening
sat
in
his
chair
without
moving
he
could
take
nothing
for
dinner
but
a
partridge
with
an
imperial
pint
of
champagne
old
jolyon
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
his
hands
folded
in
front
of
him
he
alone
of
those
in
the
room
remembered
the
death
of
his
mother
and
though
he
looked
at
ann
it
was
of
that
he
was
thinking
ann
was
an
old
woman
but
death
had
come
to
her
at
came
to
all
his
face
did
not
move
his
gaze
seemed
travelling
from
very
far
aunt
hester
stood
beside
him
she
did
not
cry
now
tears
were
nature
refused
to
permit
a
further
escape
of
force
she
twisted
her
hands
looking
not
at
ann
but
from
side
to
side
seeking
some
way
of
escaping
the
effort
of
realization
of
all
the
brothers
and
sisters
james
manifested
the
most
emotion
tears
rolled
down
the
parallel
furrows
of
his
thin
face
where
he
should
go
now
to
tell
his
troubles
he
did
not
know
juley
was
no
good
hester
worse
than
useless
he
felt
ann
death
more
than
he
had
ever
thought
he
should
this
would
upset
him
for
weeks
presently
aunt
hester
stole
out
and
aunt
juley
began
moving
about
doing
was
necessary
so
that
twice
she
knocked
against
something
old
jolyon
roused
from
his
reverie
that
reverie
of
the
long
long
past
looked
sternly
at
her
and
went
away
james
alone
was
left
by
the
bedside
glancing
stealthily
round
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
he
twisted
his
long
body
down
placed
a
kiss
on
the
dead
forehead
then
he
too
hastily
left
the
room
encountering
smither
in
the
hall
he
began
to
ask
her
about
the
funeral
and
finding
that
she
knew
nothing
complained
bitterly
that
if
they
did
take
care
everything
would
go
wrong
she
had
better
send
for
knew
all
about
that
sort
of
thing
her
master
was
very
much
upset
he
would
want
looking
after
as
for
her
mistresses
they
were
no
had
no
gumption
they
would
be
ill
too
he
should
wonder
she
had
better
send
for
the
doctor
it
was
best
to
take
things
in
time
he
did
think
his
sister
ann
had
had
the
best
opinion
if
she
had
blank
she
would
have
been
alive
now
smither
might
send
to
park
lane
any
time
she
wanted
advice
of
course
his
carriage
was
at
their
service
for
the
funeral
he
supposed
she
had
such
a
thing
as
a
glass
of
claret
and
a
had
had
no
lunch
the
days
before
the
funeral
passed
quietly
it
had
long
been
known
of
course
that
aunt
ann
had
left
her
little
property
to
timothy
there
was
therefore
no
reason
for
the
slightest
agitation
soames
who
was
sole
executor
took
charge
of
all
arrangements
and
in
due
course
sent
out
the
following
invitation
to
every
male
member
of
the
family
to
your
presence
is
requested
at
the
funeral
of
miss
ann
forsyte
in
highgate
cemetery
at
noon
of
carriages
will
meet
at
the
bower
bayswater
road
at
no
flowers
by
request
the
morning
came
cold
with
a
high
grey
london
sky
and
at
ten
the
first
carriage
that
of
james
drove
up
it
contained
james
and
his
dartie
a
fine
man
with
a
square
chest
buttoned
very
tightly
into
a
frock
coat
and
a
sallow
fattish
face
adorned
with
dark
moustaches
and
that
incorrigible
commencement
of
whisker
which
eluding
the
strictest
attempts
at
shaving
seems
the
mark
of
something
deeply
ingrained
in
the
personality
of
the
shaver
being
especially
noticeable
in
men
who
speculate
soames
in
his
capacity
of
executor
received
the
guests
for
timothy
still
kept
his
bed
he
would
get
up
after
the
funeral
and
aunts
juley
and
hester
would
not
be
coming
down
till
all
was
over
when
it
was
understood
there
would
be
lunch
for
anyone
who
cared
to
come
back
the
next
to
arrive
was
roger
still
limping
from
the
gout
and
encircled
by
three
of
his
roger
eustace
and
thomas
george
the
remaining
son
arrived
almost
immediately
afterwards
in
a
hansom
and
paused
in
the
hall
to
ask
soames
how
he
found
undertaking
pay
they
disliked
each
other
then
came
two
and
jesse
perfectly
silent
and
very
well
dressed
with
special
creases
down
their
evening
trousers
then
old
jolyon
alone
next
nicholas
with
a
healthy
colour
in
his
face
and
a
carefully
veiled
sprightliness
in
every
movement
of
his
head
and
body
one
of
his
sons
followed
him
meek
and
subdued
swithin
forsyte
and
bosinney
arrived
at
the
same
moment
precedence
to
each
other
on
the
door
opening
they
tried
to
enter
together
they
renewed
their
apologies
in
the
hall
and
swithin
settling
his
stock
which
had
become
disarranged
in
the
struggle
very
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
the
other
hayman
two
married
sons
of
nicholas
together
with
tweetyman
spender
and
warry
the
husbands
of
married
forsyte
and
hayman
daughters
the
company
was
then
complete
in
all
not
a
male
member
of
the
family
being
absent
but
timothy
and
young
jolyon
entering
the
scarlet
and
green
whose
apparel
made
so
vivid
a
setting
for
their
unaccustomed
costumes
each
tried
nervously
to
find
a
seat
desirous
of
hiding
the
emphatic
blackness
of
his
trousers
there
seemed
a
sort
of
indecency
in
that
blackness
and
in
the
colour
of
their
sort
of
exaggeration
of
the
feelings
and
many
cast
shocked
looks
of
secret
envy
at
buccaneer
who
had
no
gloves
and
was
wearing
grey
trousers
a
subdued
hum
of
conversation
rose
no
one
speaking
of
the
departed
but
each
asking
after
the
other
as
though
thereby
casting
an
indirect
libation
to
this
event
which
they
had
come
to
honour
and
presently
james
said
well
i
think
we
ought
to
be
they
went
downstairs
and
two
and
two
as
they
had
been
told
off
in
strict
precedence
mounted
the
carriages
the
hearse
started
at
a
foot
pace
the
carriages
moved
slowly
after
in
the
first
went
old
jolyon
with
nicholas
in
the
second
the
twins
swithin
and
james
in
the
third
roger
and
young
roger
soames
young
nicholas
george
and
bosinney
followed
in
the
fourth
each
of
the
other
carriages
eight
in
all
held
three
or
four
of
the
family
behind
them
came
the
doctor
brougham
then
at
a
decent
interval
cabs
containing
family
clerks
and
servants
and
at
the
very
end
one
containing
nobody
at
all
but
bringing
the
total
cortege
up
to
the
number
of
thirteen
so
long
as
the
procession
kept
to
the
highway
of
the
bayswater
road
it
retained
the
but
turning
into
less
important
it
soon
broke
into
a
trot
and
so
proceeded
with
intervals
of
walking
in
the
more
fashionable
streets
until
it
arrived
in
the
first
carriage
old
jolyon
and
nicholas
were
talking
of
their
wills
in
the
second
the
twins
after
a
single
attempt
had
lapsed
into
complete
silence
both
were
rather
deaf
and
the
exertion
of
making
themselves
heard
was
too
great
only
once
james
broke
this
silence
i
shall
have
to
be
looking
about
for
some
ground
somewhere
what
arrangements
have
you
made
swithin
and
swithin
fixing
him
with
a
dreadful
stare
answered
do
talk
to
me
about
such
things
in
the
third
carriage
a
disjointed
conversation
was
carried
on
in
the
intervals
of
looking
out
to
see
how
far
they
had
got
george
remarking
well
it
was
really
time
that
the
poor
old
lady
he
believe
in
people
living
beyond
seventy
young
nicholas
replied
mildly
that
the
rule
did
seem
to
apply
to
the
forsytes
george
said
he
himself
intended
to
commit
suicide
at
sixty
young
nicholas
smiling
and
stroking
a
long
chin
did
think
his
father
would
like
that
theory
he
had
made
a
lot
of
money
since
he
was
sixty
well
seventy
was
the
outside
limit
it
was
then
time
george
said
for
them
to
go
and
leave
their
money
to
their
children
soames
hitherto
silent
here
joined
in
he
had
not
forgotten
the
remark
about
the
and
lifting
his
eyelids
almost
imperceptibly
said
it
was
all
very
well
for
people
who
never
made
money
to
talk
he
himself
intended
to
live
as
long
as
he
could
this
was
a
hit
at
george
who
was
notoriously
hard
up
bosinney
muttered
abstractedly
hear
hear
and
george
yawning
the
conversation
dropped
upon
arriving
the
coffin
was
borne
into
the
chapel
and
two
by
two
the
mourners
filed
in
behind
it
this
guard
of
men
all
attached
to
the
dead
by
the
bond
of
kinship
was
an
impressive
and
singular
sight
in
the
great
city
of
london
with
its
overwhelming
diversity
of
life
its
innumerable
vocations
pleasures
duties
its
terrible
hardness
its
terrible
call
to
individualism
the
family
had
gathered
to
triumph
over
all
this
to
give
a
show
of
tenacious
unity
to
illustrate
gloriously
that
law
of
property
underlying
the
growth
of
their
tree
by
which
it
had
thriven
and
spread
trunk
and
branches
the
sap
flowing
through
all
the
full
growth
reached
at
the
appointed
time
the
spirit
of
the
old
woman
lying
in
her
last
sleep
had
called
them
to
this
demonstration
it
was
her
final
appeal
to
that
unity
which
had
been
their
was
her
final
triumph
that
she
had
died
while
the
tree
was
yet
whole
she
was
spared
the
watching
of
the
branches
jut
out
beyond
the
point
of
balance
she
could
not
look
into
the
hearts
of
her
followers
the
same
law
that
had
worked
in
her
bringing
her
up
from
a
tall
slip
of
a
girl
to
a
woman
strong
and
grown
from
a
woman
grown
to
a
woman
old
angular
feeble
almost
witchlike
with
individuality
all
sharpened
and
sharpened
as
all
rounding
from
the
world
contact
fell
off
from
same
law
would

was
working
in
the
family
she
had
watched
like
a
mother
she
had
seen
it
young
and
growing
she
had
seen
it
strong
and
grown
and
before
her
old
eyes
had
time
or
strength
to
see
any
more
she
died
she
would
have
tried
and
who
knows
but
she
might
have
kept
it
young
and
strong
with
her
old
fingers
her
trembling
little

alas
not
even
aunt
ann
could
fight
with

before
a
fall
in
accordance
with
this
the
greatest
of
nature
ironies
the
forsyte
family
had
gathered
for
a
last
proud
pageant
before
they
fell
their
faces
to
right
and
left
in
single
lines
were
turned
for
the
most
part
impassively
toward
the
ground
guardians
of
their
thoughts
but
here
and
there
one
looking
upward
with
a
line
between
his
brows
searched
to
see
some
sight
on
the
chapel
walls
too
much
for
him
to
be
listening
to
something
that
appalled
and
the
responses
in
voices
through
which
rose
the
same
tone
the
same
unseizable
family
ring
sounded
weird
as
though
murmured
in
hurried
duplication
by
a
single
person
the
service
in
the
chapel
over
the
mourners
filed
up
again
to
guard
the
body
to
the
tomb
the
vault
stood
open
and
round
it
men
in
black
were
waiting
from
that
high
and
sacred
field
where
thousands
of
the
upper
middle
class
lay
in
their
last
sleep
the
eyes
of
the
forsytes
travelled
down
across
the
flocks
of
graves
to
the
distance
lay
london
with
no
sun
over
it
mourning
the
loss
of
its
daughter
mourning
with
this
family
so
dear
the
loss
of
her
who
was
mother
and
guardian
a
hundred
thousand
spires
and
houses
blurred
in
the
great
grey
web
of
property
lay
there
like
prostrate
worshippers
before
the
grave
of
this
the
oldest
forsyte
of
them
all
a
few
words
a
sprinkle
of
earth
the
thrusting
of
the
coffin
home
and
aunt
ann
had
passed
to
her
last
rest
round
the
vault
trustees
of
that
passing
the
five
brothers
stood
with
white
heads
bowed
they
would
see
that
ann
was
comfortable
where
she
was
going
her
little
property
must
stay
behind
but
otherwise
all
that
could
be
should
be
done
then
severally
each
stood
aside
and
putting
on
his
hat
turned
back
to
inspect
the
new
inscription
on
the
marble
of
the
family
vault
sacred
to
the
memory
of
ann
forsyte
the
daughter
of
the
above
jolyon
and
ann
forsyte
who
departed
this
life
the
day
of
september
aged
years
and
four
days
soon
perhaps
someone
else
would
be
wanting
an
inscription
it
was
strange
and
intolerable
for
they
had
not
thought
somehow
that
forsytes
could
die
and
one
and
all
they
had
a
longing
to
get
away
from
this
painfulness
this
ceremony
which
had
reminded
them
of
things
they
could
not
bear
to
think
get
away
quickly
and
go
about
their
business
and
forget
it
was
cold
too
the
wind
like
some
slow
disintegrating
force
blowing
up
the
hill
over
the
graves
struck
them
with
its
chilly
breath
they
began
to
split
into
groups
and
as
quickly
as
possible
to
fill
the
waiting
carriages
swithin
said
he
should
go
back
to
lunch
at
timothy
and
he
offered
to
take
anybody
with
him
in
his
brougham
it
was
considered
a
doubtful
privilege
to
drive
with
swithin
in
his
brougham
which
was
not
a
large
one
nobody
accepted
and
he
went
off
alone
james
and
roger
followed
immediately
after
they
also
would
drop
in
to
lunch
the
others
gradually
melted
away
old
jolyon
taking
three
nephews
to
fill
up
his
carriage
he
had
a
want
of
those
young
faces
soames
who
had
to
arrange
some
details
in
the
cemetery
office
walked
away
with
bosinney
he
had
much
to
talk
over
with
him
and
having
finished
his
business
they
strolled
to
hampstead
lunched
together
at
the
spaniard
inn
and
spent
a
long
time
in
going
into
practical
details
connected
with
the
building
of
the
house
they
then
proceeded
to
the
and
came
as
far
as
the
marble
arch
where
bosinney
went
off
to
stanhope
gate
to
see
june
soames
felt
in
excellent
spirits
when
he
arrived
home
and
confided
to
irene
at
dinner
that
he
had
had
a
good
talk
with
bosinney
who
really
seemed
a
sensible
fellow
they
had
had
a
capital
walk
too
which
had
done
his
liver
had
been
short
of
exercise
for
a
long
altogether
a
very
satisfactory
day
if
only
it
had
been
for
poor
aunt
ann
he
would
have
taken
her
to
the
theatre
as
it
was
they
must
make
the
best
of
an
evening
at
home
the
buccaneer
asked
after
you
more
than
once
he
said
suddenly
and
moved
by
some
inexplicable
desire
to
assert
his
proprietorship
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
planted
a
kiss
on
his
wife
shoulder
part
ii
chapter
of
the
house
the
winter
had
been
an
open
one
things
in
the
trade
were
slack
and
as
soames
had
reflected
before
making
up
his
mind
it
had
been
a
good
time
for
building
the
shell
of
the
house
at
robin
hill
was
thus
completed
by
the
end
of
april
now
that
there
was
something
to
be
seen
for
his
money
he
had
been
coming
down
once
twice
even
three
times
a
week
and
would
mouse
about
among
the
debris
for
hours
careful
never
to
soil
his
clothes
moving
silently
through
the
unfinished
brickwork
of
doorways
or
circling
round
the
columns
in
the
central
court
and
he
would
stand
before
them
for
minutes
together
as
though
peering
into
the
real
quality
of
their
substance
on
april
he
had
an
appointment
with
bosinney
to
go
over
the
accounts
and
five
minutes
before
the
proper
time
he
entered
the
tent
which
the
architect
had
pitched
for
himself
close
to
the
old
oak
tree
the
accounts
were
already
prepared
on
a
folding
table
and
with
a
nod
soames
sat
down
to
study
them
it
was
some
time
before
he
raised
his
head
i
ca
make
them
out
he
said
at
last
they
come
to
nearly
seven
hundred
more
than
they
after
a
glance
at
bosinney
face
he
went
on
quickly
if
you
only
make
a
firm
stand
against
these
builder
chaps
you
get
them
down
they
stick
you
with
everything
if
you
do
look
sharp
take
ten
per
cent
off
all
round
i
sha
mind
it
coming
out
a
hundred
or
so
over
the
mark
bosinney
shook
his
head
i
taken
off
every
farthing
i
can
soames
pushed
back
the
table
with
a
movement
of
anger
which
sent
the
account
sheets
fluttering
to
the
ground
then
all
i
can
say
is
he
flustered
out
you
made
a
pretty
mess
of
it
i
told
you
a
dozen
times
bosinney
answered
sharply
that
be
extras
i
pointed
them
out
to
you
over
and
over
again
i
know
that
growled
soames
i
should
have
objected
to
a
ten
pound
note
here
and
there
how
was
i
to
know
that
by
you
meant
seven
hundred
pounds
the
qualities
of
both
men
had
contributed
to
this
discrepancy
on
the
one
hand
the
architect
devotion
to
his
idea
to
the
image
of
a
house
which
he
had
created
and
believed
made
him
nervous
of
being
stopped
or
forced
to
the
use
of
makeshifts
on
the
other
soames
not
less
true
and
wholehearted
devotion
to
the
very
best
article
that
could
be
obtained
for
the
money
had
rendered
him
averse
to
believing
that
things
worth
thirteen
shillings
could
not
be
bought
with
twelve
i
wish
i
never
undertaken
your
house
said
bosinney
suddenly
you
come
down
here
worrying
me
out
of
my
life
you
want
double
the
value
for
your
money
anybody
else
would
and
now
that
you
got
a
house
that
for
its
size
is
not
to
be
beaten
in
the
county
you
do
want
to
pay
for
it
if
you
anxious
to
be
off
your
bargain
i
daresay
i
can
find
the
balance
above
the
estimates
myself
but
i
if
i
do
another
stroke
of
work
for
you
soames
regained
his
composure
knowing
that
bosinney
had
no
capital
he
regarded
this
as
a
wild
suggestion
he
saw
too
that
he
would
be
kept
indefinitely
out
of
this
house
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
and
just
at
the
crucial
point
when
the
architect
personal
care
made
all
the
difference
in
the
meantime
there
was
irene
to
be
thought
of
she
had
been
very
queer
lately
he
really
believed
it
was
only
because
she
had
taken
to
bosinney
that
she
tolerated
the
idea
of
the
house
at
all
it
would
not
do
to
make
an
open
breach
with
her
you
need
get
into
a
rage
he
said
if
i
willing
to
put
up
with
it
i
suppose
you
need
cry
out
all
i
meant
was
that
when
you
tell
me
a
thing
is
going
to
cost
so
much
i
like
in
fact
to
know
where
i
look
here
said
bosinney
and
soames
was
both
annoyed
and
surprised
by
the
shrewdness
of
his
glance
you
got
my
services
dirt
cheap
for
the
kind
of
work
i
put
into
this
house
and
the
amount
of
time
given
to
it
you
have
had
to
pay
littlemaster
or
some
other
fool
four
times
as
much
what
you
want
in
fact
is
a
man
for
a
fee
and
that
exactly
what
you
got
soames
saw
that
he
really
meant
what
he
said
and
angry
though
he
was
the
consequences
of
a
row
rose
before
him
too
vividly
he
saw
his
house
unfinished
his
wife
rebellious
himself
a
laughingstock
let
go
over
it
he
said
sulkily
and
see
how
the
money
very
well
assented
bosinney
but
we
hurry
up
if
you
do
mind
i
have
to
get
back
in
time
to
take
june
to
the
soames
cast
a
stealthy
look
at
him
and
said
coming
to
our
place
i
suppose
to
meet
her
he
was
always
coming
to
their
place
there
had
been
rain
the
night
spring
rain
and
the
earth
smelt
of
sap
and
wild
grasses
the
warm
soft
breeze
swung
the
leaves
and
the
golden
buds
of
the
old
oak
tree
and
in
the
sunshine
the
blackbirds
were
whistling
their
hearts
out
it
was
such
a
spring
day
as
breathes
into
a
man
an
ineffable
yearning
a
painful
sweetness
a
longing
that
makes
him
stand
motionless
looking
at
the
leaves
or
grass
and
fling
out
his
arms
to
embrace
he
knows
not
what
the
earth
gave
forth
a
fainting
warmth
stealing
up
through
the
chilly
garment
in
which
winter
had
wrapped
her
it
was
her
long
caress
of
invitation
to
draw
men
down
to
lie
within
her
arms
to
roll
their
bodies
on
her
and
put
their
lips
to
her
breast
on
just
such
a
day
as
this
soames
had
got
from
irene
the
promise
he
had
asked
her
for
so
often
seated
on
the
fallen
trunk
of
a
tree
he
had
promised
for
the
twentieth
time
that
if
their
marriage
were
not
a
success
she
should
be
as
free
as
if
she
had
never
married
him
do
you
swear
it
she
had
said
a
few
days
back
she
had
reminded
him
of
that
oath
he
had
answered
nonsense
i
could
have
sworn
any
such
thing
by
some
awkward
fatality
he
remembered
it
now
what
queer
things
men
would
swear
for
the
sake
of
women
he
would
have
sworn
it
at
any
time
to
gain
her
he
would
swear
it
now
if
thereby
he
could
touch
nobody
could
touch
her
she
was
and
memories
crowded
on
him
with
the
fresh
sweet
savour
of
the
spring
of
his
courtship
in
the
spring
of
the
year
he
was
visiting
his
old
and
client
george
liversedge
of
branksome
who
with
the
view
of
developing
his
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bournemouth
had
placed
the
formation
of
the
company
necessary
to
the
scheme
in
hands
liversedge
with
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
had
given
a
musical
tea
in
his
honour
later
in
the
course
of
this
function
which
soames
no
musician
had
regarded
as
an
unmitigated
bore
his
eye
had
been
caught
by
the
face
of
a
girl
dressed
in
mourning
standing
by
herself
the
lines
of
her
tall
as
yet
rather
thin
figure
showed
through
the
wispy
clinging
stuff
of
her
black
dress
her
hands
were
crossed
in
front
of
her
her
lips
slightly
parted
and
her
large
dark
eyes
wandered
from
face
to
face
her
hair
done
low
on
her
neck
seemed
to
gleam
above
her
black
collar
like
coils
of
shining
metal
and
as
soames
stood
looking
at
her
the
sensation
that
most
men
have
felt
at
one
time
or
another
went
stealing
through
peculiar
satisfaction
of
the
senses
a
peculiar
certainty
which
novelists
and
old
ladies
call
love
at
first
sight
still
stealthily
watching
her
he
at
once
made
his
way
to
his
hostess
and
stood
doggedly
waiting
for
the
music
to
cease
who
is
that
girl
with
yellow
hair
and
dark
eyes
he
asked
irene
heron
her
father
professor
heron
died
this
year
she
lives
with
her
stepmother
she
a
nice
girl
a
pretty
girl
but
no
money
introduce
me
please
said
soames
it
was
very
little
that
he
found
to
say
nor
did
he
find
her
responsive
to
that
little
but
he
went
away
with
the
resolution
to
see
her
again
he
effected
his
object
by
chance
meeting
her
on
the
pier
with
her
stepmother
who
had
the
habit
of
walking
there
from
twelve
to
one
of
a
forenoon
soames
made
this
lady
acquaintance
with
alacrity
nor
was
it
long
before
he
perceived
in
her
the
ally
he
was
looking
for
his
keen
scent
for
the
commercial
side
of
family
life
soon
told
him
that
irene
cost
her
stepmother
more
than
the
fifty
pounds
a
year
she
brought
her
it
also
told
him
that
heron
a
woman
yet
in
the
prime
of
life
desired
to
be
married
again
the
strange
ripening
beauty
of
her
stepdaughter
stood
in
the
way
of
this
desirable
consummation
and
soames
in
his
stealthy
tenacity
laid
his
plans
he
left
bournemouth
without
having
given
himself
away
but
in
a
time
came
back
and
this
time
he
spoke
not
to
the
girl
but
to
her
stepmother
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
said
he
would
wait
any
time
and
he
had
long
to
wait
watching
irene
bloom
the
lines
of
her
young
figure
softening
the
stronger
blood
deepening
the
gleam
of
her
eyes
and
warming
her
face
to
a
creamy
glow
and
at
each
visit
he
proposed
to
her
and
when
that
visit
was
at
an
end
took
her
refusal
away
with
him
back
to
london
sore
at
heart
but
steadfast
and
silent
as
the
grave
he
tried
to
come
at
the
secret
springs
of
her
resistance
only
once
had
he
a
gleam
of
light
it
was
at
one
of
those
assembly
dances
which
afford
the
only
outlet
to
the
passions
of
the
population
of
seaside
he
was
sitting
with
her
in
an
embrasure
his
senses
tingling
with
the
contact
of
the
waltz
she
had
looked
at
him
over
her
slowly
waving
fan
and
he
had
lost
his
head
seizing
that
moving
wrist
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
flesh
of
her
arm
and
she
had
this
day
he
had
not
forgotten
that
the
look
so
passionately
averse
she
had
given
him
a
year
after
that
she
had
yielded
what
had
made
her
yield
he
could
never
make
out
and
from
heron
a
woman
of
some
diplomatic
talent
he
learnt
nothing
once
after
they
were
married
he
asked
her
what
made
you
refuse
me
so
often
she
had
answered
by
a
strange
silence
an
enigma
to
him
from
the
day
that
he
first
saw
her
she
was
an
enigma
to
him
still
bosinney
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
and
on
his
rugged
face
was
a
queer
yearning
yet
happy
look
as
though
he
too
saw
a
promise
of
bliss
in
the
spring
sky
sniffed
a
coming
happiness
in
the
spring
air
soames
looked
at
him
waiting
there
what
was
the
matter
with
the
fellow
that
he
looked
so
happy
what
was
he
waiting
for
with
that
smile
on
his
lips
and
in
his
eyes
soames
could
not
see
that
for
which
bosinney
was
waiting
as
he
stood
there
drinking
in
the
wind
and
once
more
he
felt
baffled
in
the
presence
of
this
man
whom
by
habit
he
despised
he
hastened
on
to
the
house
the
only
colour
for
those
tiles
he
heard
bosinney
say
is
ruby
with
a
grey
tint
in
the
stuff
to
give
a
transparent
effect
i
should
like
irene
opinion
i
ordering
the
purple
leather
curtains
for
the
doorway
of
this
court
and
if
you
distemper
the
ivory
cream
over
paper
you
get
an
illusive
look
you
want
to
aim
all
through
the
decorations
at
what
i
call
soames
said
you
mean
that
my
wife
has
charm
bosinney
evaded
the
question
you
should
have
a
clump
of
iris
plants
in
the
centre
of
that
soames
smiled
superciliously
i
look
into
beech
some
time
he
said
and
see
appropriate
they
found
little
else
to
say
to
each
other
but
on
the
way
to
the
station
soames
asked
i
suppose
you
find
irene
very
the
abrupt
answer
was
as
distinct
a
snub
as
saying
if
you
want
to
discuss
her
you
can
do
it
with
someone
else
and
the
slow
sulky
anger
soames
had
felt
all
the
afternoon
burned
the
brighter
within
him
neither
spoke
again
till
they
were
close
to
the
station
then
soames
asked
when
do
you
expect
to
have
finished
by
the
end
of
june
if
you
really
wish
me
to
decorate
as
soames
nodded
but
you
quite
understand
he
said
that
the
house
is
costing
me
a
lot
beyond
what
i
contemplated
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
should
have
thrown
it
up
only
i
not
in
the
habit
of
giving
up
what
i
set
my
mind
bosinney
made
no
reply
and
soames
gave
him
askance
a
look
of
dogged
in
spite
of
his
fastidious
air
and
that
supercilious
dandified
taciturnity
soames
with
his
set
lips
and
squared
chin
was
not
unlike
a
bulldog
when
at
seven
that
evening
june
arrived
at
montpellier
square
the
maid
bilson
told
her
that
bosinney
was
in
the
the
dressing
and
would
be
down
in
a
minute
she
would
tell
her
that
miss
june
was
here
june
stopped
her
at
once
all
right
bilson
she
said
i
just
go
in
you
need
hurry
she
took
off
her
cloak
and
bilson
with
an
understanding
look
did
not
even
open
the
door
for
her
but
ran
downstairs
june
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
herself
in
the
little
silver
mirror
above
the
oaken
rug
slim
imperious
young
figure
with
a
small
resolute
face
in
a
white
frock
cut
at
the
base
of
a
neck
too
slender
for
her
crown
of
twisted
hair
she
opened
the
door
softly
meaning
to
take
him
by
surprise
the
room
was
filled
with
a
sweet
hot
scent
of
flowering
azaleas
she
took
a
long
breath
of
the
perfume
and
heard
bosinney
voice
not
in
the
room
but
quite
close
saying
ah
there
were
such
heaps
of
things
i
wanted
to
talk
about
and
now
we
sha
have
time
irene
voice
answered
why
not
at
dinner
how
can
one
talk
june
first
thought
was
to
go
away
but
instead
she
crossed
to
the
long
window
opening
on
the
little
court
it
was
from
there
that
the
scent
of
the
azaleas
came
and
standing
with
their
backs
to
her
their
faces
buried
in
the
blossoms
stood
her
lover
and
irene
silent
but
unashamed
with
flaming
cheeks
and
angry
eyes
the
girl
watched
come
on
sunday
by
can
go
over
the
house
june
saw
irene
look
up
at
him
through
her
screen
of
blossoms
it
was
not
the
look
of
a
coquette
worse
to
the
watching
a
woman
fearful
lest
that
look
should
say
too
much
i
promised
to
go
for
a
drive
with
uncle
the
big
one
make
him
bring
you
it
only
ten
very
thing
for
his
poor
old
uncle
swithin
a
wave
of
the
azalea
scent
drifted
into
june
face
she
felt
sick
and
dizzy
do
ah
do
but
why
i
must
see
you
thought
you
like
to
help
me
the
answer
seemed
to
the
girl
to
come
softly
with
a
tremble
from
amongst
the
blossoms
so
i
do
and
she
stepped
into
the
open
space
of
the
window
how
stuffy
it
is
here
she
said
i
ca
bear
this
scent
her
eyes
so
angry
and
direct
swept
both
their
faces
were
you
talking
about
the
house

have
seen
it
yet

all

on
sunday

answered

him

in
the
habit
of
throwing
people

was
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
june
saw
soames
standing
just
behind
her
well

to

lengthy
pause
in
perfect
harmony

eating

bosinney
counted
up
the
stones

irene
finished
softly

there

a
glorious

and
at
the
door
irene
watched
them
go
bosinney
called
good
night
good
night
she
answered
softly
june
made
her
lover
take
her
on
the
top
of
a
saying
she
wanted
air
and
there
sat
silent
with
her
face
to
the
breeze
the
driver
turned
once
or
twice
with
the
intention
of
venturing
a
remark
but
thought
better
of
it
they
were
a
lively
couple
the
spring
had
got
into
his
blood
too
he
felt
the
need
for
letting
steam
escape
and
clucked
his
tongue
flourishing
his
whip
wheeling
his
horses
and
even
they
poor
things
had
smelled
the
spring
and
for
a
brief
spurned
the
pavement
with
happy
hoofs
the
whole
town
was
alive
the
boughs
curled
upward
with
their
decking
of
young
leaves
awaited
some
gift
the
breeze
could
bring
lamps
were
gaining
mastery
and
the
faces
of
the
crowd
showed
pale
under
that
glare
while
on
high
the
great
white
clouds
slid
swiftly
softly
over
the
purple
sky
men
in
evening
dress
had
thrown
back
overcoats
stepping
jauntily
up
the
steps
of
clubs
working
folk
loitered
and
women
who
at
that
time
of
night
are
and
moving
eastward
in
a
slowly
along
with
expectation
in
their
gait
dreaming
of
good
wine
and
a
good
supper
an
unwonted
minute
of
kisses
given
for
love
those
countless
figures
going
their
ways
under
the
lamps
and
the
had
one
and
all
received
some
restless
blessing
from
the
stir
of
spring
and
one
and
all
like
those
clubmen
with
their
opened
coats
had
shed
something
of
caste
and
creed
and
custom
and
by
the
cock
of
their
hats
the
pace
of
their
walk
their
laughter
or
their
silence
revealed
their
common
kinship
under
the
passionate
heavens
bosinney
and
june
entered
the
theatre
in
silence
and
mounted
to
their
seats
in
the
upper
boxes
the
piece
had
just
begun
and
the
house
with
its
rows
of
creatures
peering
all
one
way
resembled
a
great
garden
of
flowers
turning
their
faces
to
the
sun
june
had
never
before
been
in
the
upper
boxes
from
the
age
of
fifteen
she
had
habitually
accompanied
her
grandfather
to
the
stalls
and
not
common
stalls
but
the
best
seats
in
the
house
towards
the
centre
of
the
third
row
booked
by
old
jolyon
at
grogan
and
boyne
on
his
way
home
from
the
city
long
before
the
day
carried
in
his
overcoat
pocket
together
with
his
and
his
old
kid
gloves
and
handed
to
june
to
keep
till
the
appointed
night
and
in
those
erect
old
figure
with
a
serene
white
head
a
little
figure
strenuous
and
eager
with
a
would
sit
through
every
kind
of
play
and
on
the
way
home
old
jolyon
would
say
of
the
principal
actor
oh
he
a
poor
stick
you
should
have
seen
little
bobson
she
had
looked
forward
to
this
evening
with
keen
delight
it
was
stolen
undreamed
of
at
stanhope
gate
where
she
was
supposed
to
be
at
soames
she
had
expected
reward
for
her
subterfuge
planned
for
her
lover
sake
she
had
expected
it
to
break
up
the
thick
chilly
cloud
and
make
the
relations
between
them
which
of
late
had
been
so
puzzling
so
and
simple
again
as
they
had
been
before
the
winter
she
had
come
with
the
intention
of
saying
something
definite
and
she
looked
at
the
stage
with
a
furrow
between
her
brows
seeing
nothing
her
hands
squeezed
together
in
her
lap
a
swarm
of
jealous
suspicions
stung
and
stung
her
if
bosinney
was
conscious
of
her
trouble
he
made
no
sign
the
curtain
dropped
the
first
act
had
come
to
an
end
it
awfully
hot
here
said
the
girl
i
should
like
to
go
she
was
very
white
and
she
with
her
nerves
thus
sharpened
she
saw
he
was
both
uneasy
and
compunctious
at
the
back
of
the
theatre
an
open
balcony
hung
over
the
street
she
took
possession
of
this
and
stood
leaning
there
without
a
word
waiting
for
him
to
begin
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
phil
she
said
yes
the
defensive
tone
of
his
voice
brought
the
colour
flying
to
her
cheek
the
words
flying
to
her
lips
you
do
give
me
a
chance
to
be
nice
to
you
you
have
for
ages
now
bosinney
stared
down
at
the
street
he
made
no
answer
june
cried
passionately
you
know
i
want
to
do
everything
for
i
want
to
be
everything
to
you
a
hum
rose
from
the
street
and
piercing
it
with
a
sharp
the
bell
sounded
for
the
raising
of
the
curtain
june
did
not
stir
a
desperate
struggle
was
going
on
within
her
should
she
put
everything
to
the
proof
should
she
challenge
directly
that
influence
that
attraction
which
was
driving
him
away
from
her
it
was
her
nature
to
challenge
and
she
said
phil
take
me
to
see
the
house
on
sunday
with
a
smile
quivering
and
breaking
on
her
lips
and
trying
how
hard
not
to
show
that
she
was
watching
she
searched
his
face
saw
it
waver
and
hesitate
saw
a
troubled
line
come
between
his
brows
the
blood
rush
into
his
face
he
answered
not
sunday
dear
some
other
day
why
not
sunday
i
should
be
in
the
way
on
he
made
an
evident
effort
and
said
i
have
an
you
are
going
to
take
his
eyes
grew
angry
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
answered
an
engagement
that
will
prevent
my
taking
you
to
see
the
house
june
bit
her
lip
till
the
blood
came
and
walked
back
to
her
seat
without
another
word
but
she
could
not
help
the
tears
of
rage
rolling
down
her
face
the
house
had
been
mercifully
darkened
for
a
crisis
and
no
one
could
see
her
trouble
yet
in
this
world
of
forsytes
let
no
man
think
himself
immune
from
observation
in
the
third
row
behind
euphemia
nicholas
youngest
daughter
with
her
tweetyman
were
watching
they
reported
at
timothy
how
they
had
seen
june
and
her
fiance
at
the
theatre
in
the
stalls
no
not
in
the
oh
in
the
dress
circle
of
course
that
seemed
to
be
quite
fashionable
nowadays
with
young
people
exactly
in
the
anyway
that
engagement
would
last
long
they
had
never
seen
anyone
look
so
thunder
and
lightningy
as
that
little
june
with
tears
of
enjoyment
in
their
eyes
they
related
how
she
had
kicked
a
man
hat
as
she
returned
to
her
seat
in
the
middle
of
an
act
and
how
the
man
had
looked
euphemia
had
a
noted
silent
laugh
terminating
most
disappointingly
in
squeaks
and
when
small
holding
up
her
hands
said
my
dear
kicked
a
she
let
out
such
a
number
of
these
that
she
had
to
be
recovered
with
as
she
went
away
she
said
to
tweetyman
kicked
oh
i
shall
for
little
june
this
evening
that
was
to
have
been
treat
was
the
most
miserable
she
had
ever
spent
god
knows
she
tried
to
stifle
her
pride
her
suspicion
her
jealousy
she
parted
from
bosinney
at
old
jolyon
door
without
breaking
down
the
feeling
that
her
lover
must
be
conquered
was
strong
enough
to
sustain
her
till
his
retiring
footsteps
brought
home
the
true
extent
of
her
wretchedness
the
noiseless
let
her
in
she
would
have
slipped
up
to
her
own
room
but
old
jolyon
who
had
heard
her
entrance
was
in
the
doorway
come
in
and
have
your
milk
he
said
it
been
kept
hot
for
you
you
very
late
where
have
you
been
june
stood
at
the
fireplace
with
a
foot
on
the
fender
and
an
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
as
her
grandfather
had
done
when
he
came
in
that
night
of
the
opera
she
was
too
near
a
breakdown
to
care
what
she
told
him
we
dined
at
h
the
man
of
property
his
wife
there
and
bosinney
old
jolyon
glance
was
fixed
on
her
with
the
penetrating
gaze
from
which
it
was
difficult
to
hide
but
she
was
not
looking
at
him
and
when
she
turned
her
face
he
dropped
his
scrutiny
at
once
he
had
seen
enough
and
too
much
he
bent
down
to
lift
the
cup
of
milk
for
her
from
the
hearth
and
turning
away
grumbled
you
ought
to
stay
out
so
late
it
makes
you
fit
for
he
was
invisible
now
behind
his
paper
which
he
turned
with
a
vicious
crackle
but
when
june
came
up
to
kiss
him
he
said
my
darling
in
a
tone
so
tremulous
and
unexpected
that
it
was
all
the
girl
could
do
to
get
out
of
the
room
without
breaking
into
the
fit
of
sobbing
which
lasted
her
well
on
into
the
night
when
the
door
was
closed
old
jolyon
dropped
his
paper
and
stared
long
and
anxiously
in
front
of
him
beggar
he
thought
always
knew
she
have
trouble
with
him
uneasy
doubts
and
suspicions
the
more
poignant
that
he
felt
himself
powerless
to
check
or
control
the
march
of
events
came
crowding
upon
him
was
the
fellow
going
to
jilt
her
he
longed
to
go
and
say
to
him
look
here
you
sir
are
you
going
to
jilt
my
but
how
could
he
knowing
little
or
nothing
he
was
yet
certain
with
his
unerring
astuteness
that
there
was
something
going
on
he
suspected
bosinney
of
being
too
much
at
montpellier
square
fellow
he
thought
not
be
a
scamp
his
face
is
not
a
bad
one
but
he
a
queer
fish
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
him
i
shall
never
know
what
to
make
of
him
they
tell
me
he
works
like
a
nigger
but
i
see
no
good
coming
of
it
he
unpractical
he
has
no
method
when
he
comes
here
he
sits
as
glum
as
a
monkey
if
i
ask
him
what
wine
have
he
says
thanks
any
if
i
offer
him
a
cigar
he
smokes
it
as
if
it
were
a
twopenny
german
thing
i
never
see
him
looking
at
june
as
he
ought
to
look
at
her
and
yet
he
not
after
her
money
if
she
were
to
make
a
sign
he
be
off
his
bargain
but
she
she
she
stick
to
him
she
as
obstinate
as
never
let
go
sighing
deeply
he
turned
the
paper
in
its
columns
perchance
he
might
find
consolation
and
upstairs
in
her
room
june
sat
at
her
open
window
where
the
spring
wind
came
after
its
revel
across
the
park
to
cool
her
hot
cheeks
and
burn
her
heart
chapter
with
swithin
two
lines
of
a
certain
song
in
a
certain
famous
old
school
songbook
run
as
follows
the
buttons
on
his
blue
frock
shone
how
he
carolled
and
he
sang
like
a
bird
swithin
did
not
exactly
carol
and
sing
like
a
bird
but
he
felt
almost
like
endeavouring
to
hum
a
tune
as
he
stepped
out
of
hyde
park
mansions
and
contemplated
his
horses
drawn
up
before
the
door
the
afternoon
was
as
balmy
as
a
day
in
june
and
to
complete
the
simile
of
the
old
song
he
had
put
on
a
blue
dispensing
with
an
overcoat
after
sending
adolf
down
three
times
to
make
sure
that
there
was
not
the
least
suspicion
of
east
in
the
wind
and
the
was
buttoned
so
tightly
around
his
personable
form
that
if
the
buttons
did
not
shine
they
might
pardonably
have
done
so
majestic
on
the
pavement
he
fitted
on
a
pair
of
gloves
with
his
large
top
hat
and
his
great
stature
and
bulk
he
looked
too
primeval
for
a
forsyte
his
thick
white
hair
on
which
adolf
had
bestowed
a
touch
of
pomatum
exhaled
the
fragrance
of
opoponax
and
celebrated
swithin
brand
for
which
he
paid
one
hundred
and
forty
shillings
the
hundred
and
of
which
old
jolyon
had
unkindly
said
he
would
smoke
them
as
a
gift
they
wanted
the
stomach
of
a
horse
adolf
sare
the
new
plaid
rug
he
would
never
teach
that
fellow
to
look
smart
and
soames
he
felt
sure
had
an
eye
the
phaeton
hood
down
i
am
a
pretty
woman
would
want
to
show
off
her
frock
and
was
going
to
drive
a
lady
it
was
like
a
new
beginning
to
the
good
old
days
ages
since
he
had
driven
a
woman
the
last
time
if
he
remembered
it
had
been
juley
the
poor
old
soul
had
been
as
nervous
as
a
cat
the
whole
time
and
so
put
him
out
of
patience
that
as
he
dropped
her
in
the
bayswater
road
he
had
said
well
i
if
i
ever
drive
you
again
and
he
never
had
not
he
going
up
to
his
horses
heads
he
examined
their
bits
not
that
he
knew
anything
about
did
pay
his
coachman
sixty
pounds
a
year
to
do
his
work
for
him
that
had
never
been
his
principle
indeed
his
reputation
as
a
horsey
man
rested
mainly
on
the
fact
that
once
on
derby
day
he
had
been
welshed
by
some
but
someone
at
the
club
after
seeing
him
drive
his
greys
up
to
the
always
drove
grey
horses
you
got
more
style
for
the
money
some
called
him
forsyte
the
name
having
reached
his
ears
through
that
fellow
nicholas
treffry
old
jolyon
dead
partner
the
great
driving
man
notorious
for
more
carriage
accidents
than
any
man
in
the
had
ever
after
conceived
it
right
to
act
up
to
it
the
name
had
taken
his
fancy
not
because
he
had
ever
driven
or
was
ever
likely
to
but
because
of
something
distinguished
in
the
sound
forsyte
not
bad
born
too
soon
swithin
had
missed
his
vocation
coming
upon
london
twenty
years
later
he
could
not
have
failed
to
have
become
a
stockbroker
but
at
the
time
when
he
was
obliged
to
select
this
great
profession
had
not
as
yet
became
the
chief
glory
of
the
class
he
had
literally
been
forced
into
land
agency
once
in
the
driving
seat
with
the
reins
handed
to
him
and
blinking
over
his
pale
old
cheeks
in
the
full
sunlight
he
took
a
slow
look
was
already
up
behind
the
cockaded
groom
at
the
heads
stood
ready
to
let
go
everything
was
prepared
for
the
signal
and
swithin
gave
it
the
equipage
dashed
forward
and
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
with
a
rattle
and
flourish
drew
up
at
soames
door
irene
came
out
at
once
and
stepped
afterward
described
it
at
as
light
no
fuss
about
it
no
wanting
this
or
wanting
that
and
above
all
swithin
dwelt
on
this
staring
at
septimus
in
a
way
that
disconcerted
her
a
good
deal
no
silly
nervousness
to
aunt
hester
he
portrayed
irene
hat
not
one
of
your
great
flopping
things
sprawling
about
and
catching
the
dust
that
women
are
so
fond
of
nowadays
but
a
neat
he
made
a
circular
motion
of
his
hand
white
what
was
it
made
of
inquired
aunt
hester
who
manifested
a
languid
but
permanent
excitement
at
any
mention
of
dress
made
of
returned
swithin
now
how
should
i
know
he
sank
into
silence
so
profound
that
aunt
hester
began
to
be
afraid
he
had
fallen
into
a
trance
she
did
not
try
to
rouse
him
herself
it
not
being
her
custom
wish
somebody
would
come
she
thought
do
like
the
look
of
him
but
suddenly
swithin
returned
to
life
made
of
he
wheezed
out
slowly
what
should
it
be
made
of
they
had
not
gone
four
miles
before
swithin
received
the
impression
that
irene
liked
driving
with
him
her
face
was
so
soft
behind
that
white
veil
and
her
dark
eyes
shone
so
in
the
spring
light
and
whenever
he
spoke
she
raised
them
to
him
and
smiled
on
saturday
morning
soames
had
found
her
at
her
with
a
note
written
to
swithin
putting
him
off
why
did
she
want
to
put
him
off
he
asked
she
might
put
her
own
people
off
when
she
liked
he
would
not
have
her
putting
off
his
people
she
had
looked
at
him
intently
had
torn
up
the
note
and
said
very
well
and
then
she
began
writing
another
he
took
a
casual
glance
presently
and
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
bosinney
what
are
you
writing
to
him
about
he
asked
irene
looking
at
him
again
with
that
intent
look
said
quietly
something
he
wanted
me
to
do
for
him
humph
said
soames
commissions
you
have
your
work
cut
out
if
you
begin
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
no
more
swithin
opened
his
eyes
at
the
mention
of
robin
hill
it
was
a
long
way
for
his
horses
and
he
always
dined
at
seven
before
the
rush
at
the
club
began
the
new
chef
took
more
trouble
with
an
early
lazy
rascal
he
would
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
house
however
a
house
appealed
to
any
forsyte
and
especially
to
one
who
had
been
an
auctioneer
after
all
he
said
the
distance
was
nothing
when
he
was
a
younger
man
he
had
had
rooms
at
richmond
for
many
years
kept
his
carriage
and
pair
there
and
drove
them
up
and
down
to
business
every
day
of
his
life
forsyte
they
called
him
his
his
horses
had
been
known
from
hyde
park
corner
to
the
star
and
garter
the
duke
of
z
wanted
to
get
hold
of
them
would
have
given
him
double
the
money
but
he
had
kept
them
know
a
good
thing
when
you
have
it
eh
a
look
of
solemn
pride
came
portentously
on
his
shaven
square
old
face
he
rolled
his
head
in
his
collar
like
a
preening
himself
she
was
charming
woman
he
enlarged
upon
her
frock
afterwards
to
aunt
juley
who
held
up
her
hands
at
his
way
of
putting
it
fitted
her
like
a
as
a
drum
that
was
how
he
liked
all
of
a
piece
none
of
your
daverdy
scarecrow
women
he
gazed
at
septimus
small
who
took
after
and
thin
there
style
about
her
he
went
on
fit
for
a
king
and
she
so
quiet
with
it
too
she
seems
to
have
made
quite
a
conquest
of
you
any
way
drawled
aunt
hester
from
her
corner
swithin
heard
extremely
well
when
anybody
attacked
him
what
that
he
said
i
know
when
i
see
one
and
all
i
can
say
is
i
do
see
the
young
man
about
that
fit
for
her
but
come
oh
murmured
aunt
hester
ask
juley
long
before
they
reached
robin
hill
however
the
unaccustomed
airing
had
made
him
terribly
sleepy
he
drove
with
his
eyes
closed
a
of
deportment
alone
keeping
his
tall
and
bulky
form
from
falling
askew
bosinney
who
was
watching
came
out
to
meet
them
and
all
three
entered
the
house
together
swithin
in
front
making
play
with
a
stout
malacca
cane
put
into
his
hand
by
adolf
for
his
knees
were
feeling
the
effects
of
their
long
stay
in
the
same
position
he
had
assumed
his
fur
coat
to
guard
against
the
draughts
of
the
unfinished
house
the
handsome
the
baronial
style
they
would
want
some
statuary
about
he
came
to
a
standstill
between
the
columns
of
the
doorway
into
the
inner
court
and
held
out
his
cane
inquiringly
what
was
this
to
vestibule
or
whatever
they
called
it
but
gazing
at
the
skylight
inspiration
came
to
him
ah
the
when
told
it
was
to
be
a
tiled
court
with
plants
in
the
centre
he
turned
to
irene
waste
this
on
plants
you
take
my
advice
and
have
a
billiard
table
here
irene
smiled
she
had
lifted
her
veil
banding
it
like
a
nun
coif
across
her
forehead
and
the
smile
of
her
dark
eyes
below
this
seemed
to
swithin
more
charming
than
ever
he
nodded
she
would
take
his
advice
he
saw
he
had
little
to
say
of
the
drawing
or
which
he
described
as
spacious
but
fell
into
such
raptures
as
he
permitted
to
a
man
of
his
dignity
in
the
to
which
he
descended
by
stone
steps
bosinney
going
first
with
a
light
you
have
room
here
he
said
for
six
or
seven
hundred
very
pooty
little
cellar
bosinney
having
expressed
the
wish
to
show
them
the
house
from
the
copse
below
swithin
came
to
a
stop
there
a
fine
view
from
here
he
remarked
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
chair
a
chair
was
brought
him
from
bosinney
tent
you
go
down
he
said
blandly
you
two
i
sit
here
and
look
at
the
he
sat
down
by
the
oak
tree
in
the
sun
square
and
upright
with
one
hand
stretched
out
resting
on
the
nob
of
his
cane
the
other
planted
on
his
knee
his
fur
coat
thrown
open
his
hat
roofing
with
its
flat
top
the
pale
square
of
his
face
his
stare
very
blank
fixed
on
the
landscape
he
nodded
to
them
as
they
went
off
down
through
the
fields
he
was
indeed
not
sorry
to
be
left
thus
for
a
quiet
moment
of
reflection
the
air
was
balmy
not
too
much
heat
in
the
sun
the
prospect
a
fine
one
a
remarka
his
head
fell
a
little
to
one
side
he
jerked
it
up
and
thought
odd
they
were
waving
to
him
from
the
bottom
he
put
up
his
hand
and
moved
it
more
than
once
they
were
prospect
was
remar
his
head
fell
to
the
left
he
jerked
it
up
at
once
it
fell
to
the
right
it
remained
there
he
was
asleep
and
asleep
a
sentinel
on
of
the
rise
he
appeared
to
rule
over
this
some
image
blocked
out
by
the
special
artist
of
primeval
forsytes
in
pagan
days
to
record
the
domination
of
mind
over
matter
and
all
the
unnumbered
generations
of
his
yeoman
ancestors
wont
of
a
sunday
to
stand
akimbo
surveying
their
little
plots
of
land
their
grey
unmoving
eyes
hiding
their
instinct
with
its
hidden
roots
of
violence
their
instinct
for
possession
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
these
unnumbered
generations
seemed
to
sit
there
with
him
on
the
top
of
the
rise
but
from
him
thus
slumbering
his
jealous
forsyte
spirit
travelled
far
into
jungle
of
fancies
with
those
two
young
people
to
see
what
they
were
doing
down
there
in
the
the
copse
where
the
spring
was
running
riot
with
the
scent
of
sap
and
bursting
buds
the
song
of
birds
innumerable
a
carpet
of
bluebells
and
sweet
growing
things
and
the
sun
caught
like
gold
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
to
see
what
they
were
doing
walking
along
there
so
close
together
on
the
path
that
was
too
narrow
walking
along
there
so
close
that
they
were
always
touching
to
watch
irene
eyes
like
dark
thieves
stealing
the
heart
out
of
the
spring
and
a
great
unseen
chaperon
his
spirit
was
there
stopping
with
them
to
look
at
the
little
furry
corpse
of
a
mole
not
dead
an
hour
with
his
coat
untouched
by
the
rain
or
dew
watching
over
irene
bent
head
and
the
soft
look
of
her
pitying
eyes
and
over
that
young
man
head
gazing
at
her
so
hard
so
strangely
walking
on
with
them
too
across
the
open
space
where
a
had
been
at
work
where
the
bluebells
were
trampled
down
and
a
trunk
had
swayed
and
staggered
down
from
its
gashed
stump
climbing
it
with
them
over
and
on
to
the
very
edge
of
the
copse
whence
there
stretched
an
undiscovered
country
from
far
away
in
which
came
the
sounds
silent
standing
with
them
there
and
uneasy
at
their
silence
very
queer
very
strange
then
back
again
as
though
guilty
through
the
to
the
cutting
still
silent
amongst
the
songs
of
birds
that
never
ceased
and
the
wild
what
was
that
herb
they
put
to
the
log
across
the
path
and
then
unseen
uneasy
flapping
above
them
trying
to
make
noises
his
forsyte
spirit
watched
her
balanced
on
the
log
her
pretty
figure
swaying
smiling
down
at
that
young
man
gazing
up
with
such
strange
shining
eyes
slipping
falling
his
breast
her
soft
warm
body
clutched
her
head
bent
back
from
his
lips
his
kiss
her
recoil
his
cry
you
must
love
you
must
a
pretty
love
hah
swithin
awoke
virtue
had
gone
out
of
him
he
had
a
taste
in
his
mouth
where
was
he
damme
he
had
been
asleep
he
had
dreamed
something
about
a
new
soup
with
a
taste
of
mint
in
it
those
young
had
they
got
to
his
left
leg
had
pins
and
needles
adolf
the
rascal
was
not
there
the
rascal
was
asleep
somewhere
he
stood
up
tall
square
bulky
in
his
fur
looking
anxiously
down
over
the
fields
and
presently
he
saw
them
coming
irene
was
in
front
that
young
had
they
nicknamed
buccaneer
looked
precious
hangdog
there
behind
her
had
got
a
flea
in
his
ear
he
should
wonder
serve
him
right
taking
her
down
all
that
way
to
look
at
the
house
the
proper
place
to
look
at
a
house
from
was
the
lawn
they
saw
him
he
extended
his
arm
and
moved
it
spasmodically
to
encourage
them
but
they
had
stopped
what
were
they
standing
there
for
they
came
on
again
she
had
been
giving
him
a
rub
he
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
and
no
wonder
over
a
house
like
great
ugly
thing
not
the
sort
of
house
he
was
accustomed
to
he
looked
intently
at
their
faces
with
his
pale
immovable
stare
that
young
man
looked
very
queer
you
never
make
anything
of
this
he
said
tartly
pointing
at
the
mansion
too
newfangled
bosinney
gazed
at
him
as
though
he
had
not
heard
and
swithin
afterwards
described
him
to
aunt
hester
as
an
extravagant
sort
of
fellow
very
odd
way
of
looking
at
bumpy
beggar
what
gave
rise
to
this
sudden
piece
of
psychology
he
did
not
state
possibly
bosinney
prominent
forehead
and
cheekbones
and
chin
or
something
hungry
in
his
face
which
quarrelled
with
swithin
conception
of
the
calm
satiety
that
should
characterize
the
perfect
gentleman
he
brightened
up
at
the
mention
of
tea
he
had
a
contempt
for
brother
jolyon
had
been
in
tea
made
a
lot
of
money
by
he
was
so
thirsty
and
had
such
a
taste
in
his
mouth
that
he
was
prepared
to
drink
anything
he
longed
to
inform
irene
of
the
taste
in
his
was
so
it
would
not
be
a
distinguished
thing
to
do
he
rolled
his
tongue
round
and
faintly
smacked
it
against
his
palate
in
a
far
corner
of
the
tent
adolf
was
bending
his
moustaches
over
a
kettle
he
left
it
at
once
to
draw
the
cork
of
a
of
champagne
swithin
smiled
and
nodding
at
bosinney
said
why
quite
a
monte
cristo
this
celebrated
of
the
he
had
produced
an
extraordinary
impression
on
his
mind
taking
his
glass
from
the
table
he
held
it
away
from
him
to
scrutinize
the
colour
thirsty
as
he
was
it
was
not
likely
that
he
was
going
to
drink
trash
then
placing
it
to
his
lips
he
took
a
sip
a
very
nice
wine
he
said
at
last
passing
it
before
his
nose
not
the
equal
of
my
heidsieck
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
idea
came
to
him
which
he
afterwards
imparted
at
timothy
in
this
nutshell
i
should
wonder
a
bit
if
that
architect
chap
were
sweet
upon
soames
and
from
this
moment
his
pale
round
eyes
never
ceased
to
bulge
with
the
interest
of
his
discovery
the
fellow
he
said
to
septimus
follows
her
about
with
his
eyes
like
a
bumpy
beggar
i
do
wonder
at
a
very
charming
woman
and
i
should
say
the
pink
of
discretion
a
vague
consciousness
of
perfume
caging
about
irene
like
that
from
a
flower
with
petals
and
a
passionate
heart
moved
him
to
the
creation
of
this
image
but
i
was
sure
of
it
he
said
till
i
saw
him
pick
up
her
small
eyes
boiled
with
excitement
and
did
he
give
it
her
back
she
asked
give
it
back
said
swithin
i
saw
him
slobber
on
it
when
he
thought
i
was
looking
small
interested
to
speak
but
she
gave
him
no
encouragement
went
on
swithin
he
stopped
and
stared
for
a
minute
or
two
in
the
way
that
alarmed
aunt
hester
had
suddenly
recollected
that
as
they
were
starting
back
in
the
phaeton
she
had
given
bosinney
her
hand
a
second
time
and
let
it
stay
there
too
he
had
touched
his
horses
smartly
with
the
whip
anxious
to
get
her
all
to
himself
but
she
had
looked
back
and
she
had
not
answered
his
first
question
neither
had
he
been
able
to
see
her
had
kept
it
hanging
down
there
is
somewhere
a
picture
which
swithin
has
not
seen
of
a
man
sitting
on
a
rock
and
by
him
immersed
in
the
still
green
water
a
lying
on
her
back
with
her
hand
on
her
naked
breast
she
has
a
on
her
smile
of
hopeless
surrender
and
of
secret
joy
seated
by
swithin
side
irene
may
have
been
smiling
like
that
when
warmed
by
champagne
he
had
her
all
to
himself
he
unbosomed
himself
of
his
wrongs
of
his
smothered
resentment
against
the
new
chef
at
the
club
his
worry
over
the
house
in
wigmore
street
where
the
rascally
tenant
had
gone
bankrupt
through
helping
his
as
if
charity
did
not
begin
at
home
of
his
deafness
too
and
that
pain
he
sometimes
got
in
his
right
side
she
listened
her
eyes
swimming
under
their
lids
he
thought
she
was
thinking
deeply
of
his
troubles
and
pitied
himself
terribly
yet
in
his
fur
coat
with
frogs
across
the
breast
his
top
hat
aslant
driving
this
beautiful
woman
he
had
never
felt
more
distinguished
a
coster
however
taking
his
girl
for
a
sunday
airing
seemed
to
have
the
same
impression
about
himself
this
person
had
flogged
his
donkey
into
a
gallop
alongside
and
sat
upright
as
a
waxwork
in
his
shallopy
chariot
his
chin
settled
pompously
on
a
red
handkerchief
like
swithin
on
his
full
cravat
while
his
girl
with
the
ends
of
a
boa
floating
out
behind
aped
a
woman
of
fashion
her
swain
moved
a
stick
with
a
ragged
bit
of
string
dangling
from
the
end
reproducing
with
strange
fidelity
the
circular
flourish
of
whip
and
rolled
his
head
at
his
lady
with
a
leer
that
had
a
weird
likeness
to
swithin
primeval
stare
though
for
a
time
unconscious
of
the
lowly
ruffian
presence
swithin
presently
took
it
into
his
head
that
he
was
being
guyed
he
laid
his
across
the
mares
flank
the
two
chariots
however
by
some
unfortunate
fatality
continued
abreast
swithin
yellow
puffy
face
grew
red
he
raised
his
whip
to
lash
the
costermonger
but
was
saved
from
so
far
forgetting
his
dignity
by
a
special
intervention
of
providence
a
carriage
driving
out
through
a
gate
forced
phaeton
and
into
proximity
the
wheels
grated
the
lighter
vehicle
skidded
and
was
overturned
swithin
did
not
look
round
on
no
account
would
he
have
pulled
up
to
help
the
ruffian
serve
him
right
if
he
had
broken
his
neck
but
he
could
not
if
he
would
the
greys
had
taken
alarm
the
phaeton
swung
from
side
to
side
and
people
raised
frightened
faces
as
they
went
dashing
past
swithin
great
arms
stretched
at
full
length
tugged
at
the
reins
his
cheeks
were
puffed
his
lips
compressed
his
swollen
face
was
of
a
dull
angry
red
irene
had
her
hand
on
the
rail
and
at
every
lurch
she
gripped
it
tightly
swithin
heard
her
ask
are
we
going
to
have
an
accident
uncle
swithin
he
gasped
out
between
his
pants
it
nothing
fresh
i
never
been
in
an
do
you
move
he
took
a
look
at
her
she
was
smiling
perfectly
calm
sit
still
he
repeated
never
fear
i
get
you
home
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
terrible
efforts
he
was
surprised
to
hear
her
answer
in
a
voice
not
like
her
own
i
do
care
if
i
never
get
home
the
carriage
giving
a
terrific
lurch
swithin
exclamation
was
jerked
back
into
his
throat
the
horses
winded
by
the
rise
of
a
hill
now
steadied
to
a
trot
and
finally
stopped
of
their
own
accord
when
described
it
at
i
pulled
up
there
she
was
as
cool
as
myself
god
bless
my
soul
she
behaved
as
if
she
did
care
whether
she
broke
her
neck
or
not
what
was
it
she
said
do
care
if
i
never
get
home
leaning
over
the
handle
of
his
cane
he
wheezed
out
to
small
terror
and
i
not
altogether
surprised
with
a
finickin
feller
like
young
soames
for
a
husband
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
wonder
what
bosinney
had
done
after
they
had
left
him
there
alone
whether
he
had
gone
wandering
about
like
the
dog
to
which
swithin
had
compared
him
wandering
down
to
that
copse
where
the
spring
was
still
in
riot
the
cuckoo
still
calling
from
afar
gone
down
there
with
her
handkerchief
pressed
to
lips
its
fragrance
mingling
with
the
scent
of
mint
and
thyme
gone
down
there
with
such
a
wild
exquisite
pain
in
his
heart
that
he
could
have
cried
out
among
the
trees
or
what
indeed
the
fellow
had
done
in
fact
till
he
came
to
timothy
swithin
had
forgotten
all
about
him
chapter
goes
to
see
for
himself
those
ignorant
of
forsyte
would
not
perhaps
foresee
all
the
stir
made
by
irene
visit
to
the
house
after
swithin
had
related
at
timothy
the
full
story
of
his
memorable
drive
the
same
with
the
least
suspicion
of
curiosity
the
merest
touch
of
malice
and
a
real
desire
to
do
good
was
passed
on
to
june
and
what
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
my
dear
ended
aunt
juley
that
about
not
going
home
what
did
she
mean
it
was
a
strange
recital
for
the
girl
she
heard
it
flushing
painfully
and
suddenly
with
a
curt
handshake
took
her
departure
almost
rude
small
said
to
aunt
hester
when
june
was
gone
the
proper
construction
was
put
on
her
reception
of
the
news
she
was
upset
something
was
therefore
very
wrong
odd
she
and
irene
had
been
such
friends
it
all
tallied
too
well
with
whispers
and
hints
that
had
been
going
about
for
some
time
past
recollections
of
euphemia
account
of
the
visit
to
the
bosinney
always
at
soames
oh
indeed
yes
of
course
he
would
be
about
the
house
nothing
open
only
upon
the
greatest
the
most
important
provocation
was
it
necessary
to
say
anything
open
on
forsyte
this
machine
was
too
nicely
adjusted
a
hint
the
merest
trifling
expression
of
regret
or
doubt
sufficed
to
set
the
family
soul
so
no
one
desired
that
harm
should
come
of
these
from
it
they
were
set
in
motion
with
the
best
intentions
with
the
feeling
that
each
member
of
the
family
had
a
stake
in
the
family
soul
and
much
kindness
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
gossip
it
would
frequently
result
in
visits
of
condolence
being
made
in
accordance
with
the
customs
of
society
thereby
conferring
a
real
benefit
upon
the
sufferers
and
affording
consolation
to
the
sound
who
felt
pleasantly
that
someone
at
all
events
was
suffering
from
that
from
which
they
themselves
were
not
suffering
in
fact
it
was
simply
a
desire
to
keep
things
the
desire
which
animates
the
public
press
that
brought
james
for
instance
into
communication
with
septimus
septimus
with
the
little
nicholases
the
little
nicholases
with
and
so
on
that
great
class
to
which
they
had
risen
and
now
belonged
demanded
a
certain
candour
a
still
more
certain
reticence
this
combination
guaranteed
their
membership
many
of
the
younger
forsytes
felt
very
naturally
and
would
openly
declare
that
they
did
not
want
their
affairs
pried
into
but
so
powerful
was
the
invisible
magnetic
current
of
family
gossip
that
for
the
life
of
them
they
could
not
help
knowing
all
about
everything
it
was
felt
to
be
hopeless
one
of
them
young
roger
had
made
an
heroic
attempt
to
free
the
rising
generation
by
speaking
of
timothy
as
an
cat
the
effort
had
justly
recoiled
upon
himself
the
words
coming
round
in
the
most
delicate
way
to
aunt
juley
ears
were
repeated
by
her
in
a
shocked
voice
to
roger
whence
they
returned
again
to
young
roger
and
after
all
it
was
only
the
who
suffered
as
for
instance
george
when
he
lost
all
that
money
playing
billiards
or
young
roger
himself
when
he
was
so
dreadfully
near
to
marrying
the
girl
to
whom
it
was
whispered
he
was
already
married
by
the
laws
of
nature
or
again
irene
who
was
thought
rather
than
said
to
be
in
danger
all
this
was
not
only
pleasant
but
salutary
and
it
made
so
many
hours
go
lightly
at
timothy
in
the
bayswater
road
so
many
hours
that
must
otherwise
have
been
sterile
and
heavy
to
those
three
who
lived
there
and
timothy
was
but
one
of
hundreds
of
such
homes
in
this
city
of
homes
of
neutral
persons
of
the
secure
classes
who
are
out
of
the
battle
themselves
and
must
find
their
reason
for
existing
in
the
battles
of
others
but
for
the
sweetness
of
family
gossip
it
must
indeed
have
been
lonely
there
rumours
and
tales
reports
they
not
the
children
of
the
house
as
dear
and
precious
as
the
prattling
babes
the
brother
and
sisters
had
missed
in
their
own
journey
to
talk
about
them
was
as
near
as
they
could
get
to
the
possession
of
all
those
children
and
grandchildren
after
whom
their
soft
hearts
yearned
for
though
it
is
doubtful
whether
timothy
heart
yearned
it
is
indubitable
that
at
the
arrival
of
each
fresh
forsyte
child
he
was
quite
upset
useless
for
young
roger
to
say
old
cat
for
euphemia
to
hold
up
her
hands
and
cry
oh
those
three
and
break
into
her
silent
laugh
with
the
squeak
at
the
end
useless
and
not
too
kind
the
situation
which
at
this
stage
might
seem
and
especially
to
forsyte
eyes
to
say
in
view
of
certain
facts
not
so
strange
after
all
some
things
had
been
lost
sight
of
and
first
in
the
security
bred
of
many
harmless
marriages
it
had
been
forgotten
that
love
is
no
flower
but
a
wild
plant
born
of
a
wet
night
born
of
an
hour
of
sunshine
sprung
from
wild
seed
blown
along
the
road
by
a
wild
wind
a
wild
plant
that
when
it
blooms
by
chance
within
the
hedge
of
our
gardens
we
call
a
flower
and
when
it
blooms
outside
we
call
a
weed
but
flower
or
weed
whose
scent
and
colour
are
always
wild
and
facts
and
figures
of
their
own
lives
being
against
the
perception
of
this
was
not
generally
recognised
by
forsytes
that
where
this
wild
plant
springs
men
and
women
are
but
moths
around
the
pale
blossom
it
was
long
since
young
jolyon
was
danger
of
a
tradition
again
arising
that
people
in
their
position
never
cross
the
hedge
to
pluck
that
flower
that
one
could
reckon
on
having
love
like
measles
once
in
due
season
and
getting
over
it
comfortably
for
all
with
measles
on
a
soothing
mixture
of
butter
and
the
arms
of
wedlock
of
all
those
whom
this
strange
rumour
about
bosinney
and
soames
reached
james
was
the
most
affected
he
had
long
forgotten
how
he
had
hovered
lanky
and
pale
in
side
whiskers
of
chestnut
hue
round
emily
in
the
days
of
his
own
courtship
he
had
long
forgotten
the
small
house
in
the
purlieus
of
mayfair
where
he
had
spent
the
early
days
of
his
married
life
or
rather
he
had
long
forgotten
the
early
days
not
the
small
house
forsyte
never
forgot
a
had
afterwards
sold
it
at
a
clear
profit
of
four
hundred
pounds
he
had
long
forgotten
those
days
with
their
hopes
and
fears
and
doubts
about
the
prudence
of
the
match
for
emily
though
pretty
had
nothing
and
he
himself
at
that
time
was
making
a
bare
thousand
a
year
and
that
strange
irresistible
attraction
which
had
drawn
him
on
till
he
felt
he
must
die
if
he
could
not
marry
the
girl
with
the
fair
hair
looped
so
neatly
back
the
fair
arms
emerging
from
a
bodice
the
fair
form
decorously
shielded
by
a
cage
of
really
stupendous
circumference
james
had
passed
through
the
fire
but
he
had
passed
also
through
the
river
of
years
which
washes
out
the
fire
he
had
experienced
the
saddest
experience
of
of
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
love
forgotten
forgotten
so
long
that
he
had
forgotten
even
that
he
had
forgotten
and
now
this
rumour
had
come
upon
him
this
rumour
about
his
wife
very
vague
a
shadow
dodging
among
the
palpable
straightforward
appearances
of
things
unreal
unintelligible
as
a
ghost
but
carrying
with
it
like
a
ghost
inexplicable
terror
he
tried
to
bring
it
home
to
his
mind
but
it
was
no
more
use
than
trying
to
apply
to
himself
one
of
those
tragedies
he
read
of
daily
in
his
evening
paper
he
simply
could
not
there
could
be
nothing
in
it
it
was
all
their
nonsense
she
did
get
on
with
soames
as
well
as
she
might
but
she
was
a
good
little
good
little
thing
like
the
not
inconsiderable
majority
of
men
james
relished
a
nice
little
bit
of
scandal
and
would
say
in
a
tone
licking
his
lips
yes
and
young
dyson
they
tell
me
they
living
at
monte
carlo
but
the
significance
of
an
affair
of
this
its
past
its
present
or
its
never
struck
him
what
it
meant
what
torture
and
raptures
had
gone
to
its
construction
what
slow
overmastering
fate
had
lurked
within
the
facts
very
naked
sometimes
sordid
but
generally
spicy
presented
to
his
gaze
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
blaming
praising
drawing
deductions
or
generalizing
at
all
about
such
things
he
simply
listened
rather
greedily
and
repeated
what
he
was
told
finding
considerable
benefit
from
the
practice
as
from
the
consumption
of
a
sherry
and
bitters
before
a
meal
now
however
that
such
a
rather
the
rumour
the
breath
of
come
near
him
personally
he
felt
as
in
a
fog
which
filled
his
mouth
full
of
a
bad
thick
flavour
and
made
it
difficult
to
draw
breath
a
scandal
a
possible
scandal
to
repeat
this
word
to
himself
thus
was
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
focus
or
make
it
thinkable
he
had
forgotten
the
sensations
necessary
for
understanding
the
progress
fate
or
meaning
of
any
such
business
he
simply
could
no
longer
grasp
the
possibilities
of
people
running
any
risk
for
the
sake
of
passion
amongst
all
those
persons
of
his
acquaintance
who
went
into
the
city
day
after
day
and
did
their
business
there
whatever
it
was
and
in
their
leisure
moments
bought
shares
and
houses
and
ate
dinners
and
played
games
as
he
was
told
it
would
have
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
there
were
any
who
would
run
risks
for
the
sake
of
anything
so
recondite
so
figurative
as
passion
passion
he
seemed
indeed
to
have
heard
of
it
and
rules
such
as
young
man
and
a
young
woman
ought
never
to
be
trusted
together
were
fixed
in
his
mind
as
the
parallels
of
latitude
are
fixed
on
a
map
for
all
forsytes
when
it
comes
to
matters
of
fact
have
quite
a
fine
taste
in
realism
but
as
to
anything
he
could
only
appreciate
it
at
all
through
the
ah
but
there
was
no
truth
in
not
be
he
was
not
afraid
she
was
really
a
good
little
thing
but
there
it
was
when
you
got
a
thing
like
that
into
your
mind
and
james
was
of
a
nervous
of
those
men
whom
things
will
not
leave
alone
who
suffer
tortures
from
anticipation
and
indecision
for
fear
of
letting
something
slip
that
he
might
otherwise
secure
he
was
physically
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
until
absolutely
certain
that
by
not
making
it
up
he
would
suffer
loss
in
life
however
there
were
many
occasions
when
the
business
of
making
up
his
mind
did
not
even
rest
with
himself
and
this
was
one
of
them
what
could
he
do
talk
it
over
with
soames
that
would
only
make
matters
worse
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
in
it
he
felt
sure
it
was
all
that
house
he
had
mistrusted
the
idea
from
the
first
what
did
soames
want
to
go
into
the
country
for
and
if
he
must
go
spending
a
lot
of
money
building
himself
a
house
why
not
have
a
man
instead
of
this
young
bosinney
whom
nobody
knew
anything
about
he
had
told
them
how
it
would
be
and
he
had
heard
that
the
house
was
costing
soames
a
pretty
penny
beyond
what
he
had
reckoned
on
spending
this
fact
more
than
any
other
brought
home
to
james
the
real
danger
of
the
situation
it
was
always
like
this
with
these
chaps
a
sensible
man
should
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
he
had
warned
irene
too
and
see
what
had
come
of
it
and
it
suddenly
sprang
into
james
mind
that
he
ought
to
go
and
see
for
himself
in
the
midst
of
that
fog
of
uneasiness
in
which
his
mind
was
enveloped
the
notion
that
he
could
go
and
look
at
the
house
afforded
him
inexplicable
satisfaction
it
may
have
been
simply
the
decision
to
do
possibly
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
look
at
a
gave
him
relief
he
felt
that
in
staring
at
an
edifice
of
bricks
and
mortar
of
wood
and
stone
built
by
the
suspected
man
himself
he
would
be
looking
into
the
heart
of
that
rumour
about
irene
without
saying
a
word
therefore
to
anyone
he
took
a
hansom
to
the
station
and
proceeded
by
train
to
robin
hill
being
no
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
found
himself
obliged
to
walk
he
started
slowly
up
the
hill
his
angular
knees
and
high
shoulders
bent
complainingly
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
feet
yet
neat
for
all
that
in
his
high
hat
and
his
on
which
was
the
speckless
gloss
imparted
by
perfect
superintendence
emily
saw
to
that
that
is
she
did
not
of
course
see
to
of
good
position
not
seeing
to
each
other
buttons
and
emily
was
of
good
she
saw
that
the
butler
saw
to
it
he
had
to
ask
his
way
three
times
on
each
occasion
he
repeated
the
directions
given
him
got
the
man
to
repeat
them
then
repeated
them
a
second
time
for
he
was
naturally
of
a
talkative
disposition
and
one
could
not
be
too
careful
in
a
new
neighbourhood
he
kept
assuring
them
that
it
was
a
new
house
he
was
looking
for
it
was
only
however
when
he
was
shown
the
roof
through
the
trees
that
he
could
feel
really
satisfied
that
he
had
not
been
directed
entirely
wrong
a
heavy
sky
seemed
to
cover
the
world
with
the
grey
whiteness
of
a
whitewashed
ceiling
there
was
no
freshness
or
fragrance
in
the
air
on
such
a
day
even
british
workmen
scarcely
cared
to
do
more
then
they
were
obliged
and
moved
about
their
business
without
the
drone
of
talk
which
whiles
away
the
pangs
of
labour
through
spaces
of
the
unfinished
house
figures
worked
slowly
and
sounds
knockings
the
scraping
of
metal
the
sawing
of
wood
with
the
rumble
of
wheelbarrows
along
boards
now
and
again
the
foreman
dog
tethered
by
a
string
to
an
oaken
beam
whimpered
feebly
with
a
sound
like
the
singing
of
a
kettle
the
daubed
each
with
a
white
patch
in
the
centre
stared
out
at
james
like
the
eyes
of
a
blind
dog
and
the
building
chorus
went
on
strident
and
mirthless
under
the
sky
but
the
thrushes
hunting
amongst
the
earth
for
worms
were
silent
quite
james
picked
his
way
among
the
heaps
of
drive
was
being
he
came
opposite
the
porch
here
he
stopped
and
raised
his
eyes
there
was
but
little
to
see
from
this
point
of
view
and
that
little
he
took
in
at
once
but
he
stayed
in
this
position
many
minutes
and
who
shall
know
of
what
he
thought
his
eyes
under
white
eyebrows
that
jutted
out
in
little
horns
never
stirred
the
long
upper
lip
of
his
wide
mouth
between
the
fine
white
whiskers
twitched
once
or
twice
it
was
easy
to
see
from
that
anxious
rapt
expression
whence
soames
derived
the
handicapped
look
which
sometimes
came
upon
his
face
james
might
have
been
saying
to
himself
do
a
tough
job
in
this
position
bosinney
surprised
him
james
brought
his
eyes
down
from
whatever
they
had
been
looking
for
in
the
sky
to
bosinney
face
on
which
was
a
kind
of
humorous
scorn
how
do
you
do
forsyte
come
down
to
see
for
yourself
it
was
exactly
what
james
as
we
know
had
come
for
and
he
was
made
correspondingly
uneasy
he
held
out
his
hand
however
saying
how
are
you
without
looking
at
bosinney
the
latter
made
way
for
him
with
an
ironical
smile
james
scented
something
suspicious
in
this
courtesy
i
should
like
to
walk
round
the
outside
first
he
said
and
see
what
you
been
doing
a
flagged
terrace
of
rounded
stones
with
a
list
of
two
or
three
inches
to
port
had
been
laid
round
the
and
sides
of
the
house
and
ran
with
a
bevelled
edge
into
mould
which
was
in
preparation
for
being
turfed
along
this
terrace
james
led
the
way
now
what
did
this
cost
he
asked
when
he
saw
the
terrace
extending
round
the
corner
what
should
you
think
inquired
bosinney
how
should
i
know
replied
james
somewhat
nonplussed
two
or
three
hundred
i
dare
say
the
exact
sum
james
gave
him
a
sharp
look
but
the
architect
appeared
unconscious
and
he
put
the
answer
down
to
mishearing
on
arriving
at
the
garden
entrance
he
stopped
to
look
at
the
view
that
ought
to
come
down
he
said
pointing
to
the
you
think
so
you
think
that
with
the
tree
there
you
do
get
enough
view
for
your
again
james
eyed
him
young
man
had
a
peculiar
way
of
putting
things
well
he
said
with
a
perplexed
nervous
emphasis
i
do
see
what
you
want
with
a
it
shall
come
down
said
bosinney
james
was
alarmed
oh
he
said
do
go
saying
i
said
it
was
to
come
down
i
know
nothing
about
it
no
james
went
on
in
a
fluster
why
what
should
i
know
about
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
you
do
it
on
your
own
you
allow
me
to
mention
your
name
james
grew
more
and
more
alarmed
i
do
know
what
you
want
mentioning
my
name
for
he
muttered
you
better
leave
the
tree
alone
it
not
your
tree
he
took
out
a
silk
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
brow
they
entered
the
house
like
swithin
james
was
impressed
by
the
inner
you
must
have
spent
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
money
here
he
said
after
staring
at
the
columns
and
gallery
for
some
time
now
what
did
it
cost
to
put
up
those
columns
i
ca
tell
you
thoughtfully
answered
bosinney
but
i
know
it
was
a
deuce
of
a
lot
i
should
think
so
said
james
i
should
he
caught
the
architect
eye
and
broke
off
and
now
whenever
he
came
to
anything
of
which
he
desired
to
know
the
cost
he
stifled
that
curiosity
bosinney
appeared
determined
that
he
should
see
everything
and
had
not
james
been
of
too
a
nature
he
would
certainly
have
found
himself
going
round
the
house
a
second
time
he
seemed
so
anxious
to
be
asked
questions
too
that
james
felt
he
must
be
on
his
guard
he
began
to
suffer
from
his
exertions
for
though
wiry
enough
for
a
man
of
his
long
build
he
was
years
old
he
grew
discouraged
he
seemed
no
nearer
to
anything
had
not
obtained
from
his
inspection
any
of
the
knowledge
he
had
vaguely
hoped
for
he
had
merely
increased
his
dislike
and
mistrust
of
this
young
man
who
had
tired
him
out
with
his
politeness
and
in
whose
manner
he
now
certainly
detected
mockery
the
fellow
was
sharper
than
he
had
thought
and
than
he
had
hoped
he
had
care
appearance
that
james
to
whom
risk
was
the
most
intolerable
thing
in
life
did
not
appreciate
a
peculiar
smile
too
coming
when
least
expected
and
very
queer
eyes
he
reminded
james
as
he
said
afterwards
of
a
hungry
cat
this
was
as
near
as
he
could
get
in
conversation
with
emily
to
a
description
of
the
peculiar
exasperation
velvetiness
and
mockery
of
which
bosinney
manner
had
been
composed
at
last
having
seen
all
that
was
to
be
seen
he
came
out
again
at
the
door
where
he
had
gone
in
and
now
feeling
that
he
was
wasting
time
and
strength
and
money
all
for
nothing
he
took
the
courage
of
a
forsyte
in
both
hands
and
looking
sharply
at
bosinney
said
i
dare
say
you
see
a
good
deal
of
my
now
what
does
she
think
of
the
house
but
she
has
seen
it
i
suppose
this
he
said
knowing
all
about
irene
visit
not
of
course
that
there
was
anything
in
the
visit
except
that
extraordinary
remark
she
had
made
about
caring
to
get
the
story
of
how
june
had
taken
the
news
he
had
determined
by
this
way
of
putting
the
question
to
give
bosinney
a
chance
as
he
said
to
himself
the
latter
was
long
in
answering
but
kept
his
eyes
with
uncomfortable
steadiness
on
james
she
has
seen
the
house
but
i
ca
tell
you
what
she
thinks
of
nervous
and
baffled
james
was
constitutionally
prevented
from
letting
the
matter
drop
oh
he
said
she
has
seen
it
soames
brought
her
down
i
suppose
bosinney
smilingly
replied
oh
no
what
did
she
come
down
alone
oh
no
brought
her
i
really
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
who
brought
to
james
who
knew
that
it
was
swithin
this
answer
appeared
incomprehensible
why
he
stammered
you
know
that
but
he
stopped
suddenly
perceiving
his
danger
well
he
said
if
you
do
want
to
tell
me
i
suppose
you
wo
nobody
tells
me
somewhat
to
his
surprise
bosinney
asked
him
a
question
by
the
by
he
said
could
you
tell
me
if
there
are
likely
to
be
any
more
of
you
coming
down
i
should
like
to
be
on
the
spot
any
more
said
james
bewildered
who
should
there
be
more
i
know
of
any
more
looking
at
the
ground
he
held
out
his
hand
crossed
the
palm
of
it
with
bosinney
and
taking
his
umbrella
just
above
the
silk
walked
away
along
the
terrace
before
he
turned
the
corner
he
glanced
back
and
saw
bosinney
following
him
along
the
wall
as
he
put
it
to
himself
a
great
cat
he
paid
no
attention
when
the
young
fellow
raised
his
hat
outside
the
drive
and
out
of
sight
he
slackened
his
pace
still
more
very
slowly
more
bent
than
when
he
came
lean
hungry
and
disheartened
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
station
the
buccaneer
watching
him
go
so
sadly
home
felt
sorry
perhaps
for
his
behaviour

james
said
nothing
to
his
son
of
this
visit
to
the
house
but
having
occasion
to
go
to
timothy
one
morning
on
a
matter
connected
with
a
drainage
scheme
which
was
being
forced
by
the
sanitary
authorities
on
his
brother
he
mentioned
it
there
it

he
said
a
bad

he
could
see
that
a
good
deal
could
be
made
of

the
fellow
was
clever
in
his
way
though
what
it
was
going
to
cost

before
it
was
done

know
euphemia
forsyte
who
happened
to
be
in

had
come
round
to
borrow
the
rev

novel
and
paregoric
which
was
having
such
a
in
i
saw
irene
yesterday
at
the
stores
she
and
bosinney
were
having
a
nice
little
chat
in
the
it
was
thus
simply
that
she
recorded
a
scene
which
had
really
made
a
deep
and
complicated
impression
on
her
she
had
been
hurrying
to
the
silk
department
of
the
church
and
commercial
institution
than
which
with
its
admirable
system
admitting
only
guaranteed
persons
on
a
basis
of
payment
before
delivery
no
emporium
can
be
more
highly
recommended
to
match
a
piece
of
prunella
silk
for
her
mother
who
was
waiting
in
the
carriage
outside
passing
through
the
groceries
her
eye
was
unpleasantly
attracted
by
the
back
view
of
a
very
beautiful
figure
it
was
so
charmingly
proportioned
so
balanced
and
so
well
clothed
that
euphemia
instinctive
propriety
was
at
once
alarmed
such
figures
she
knew
by
intuition
rather
than
experience
were
rarely
connected
with
never
in
her
mind
for
her
own
back
was
somewhat
difficult
to
fit
her
suspicions
were
fortunately
confirmed
a
young
man
coming
from
the
drugs
had
snatched
off
his
hat
and
was
accosting
the
lady
with
the
unknown
back
it
was
then
that
she
saw
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
the
lady
was
undoubtedly
soames
the
young
man
bosinney
concealing
herself
rapidly
over
the
purchase
of
a
box
of
tunisian
dates
for
she
was
impatient
of
awkwardly
meeting
people
with
parcels
in
her
hands
and
at
the
busy
time
of
the
morning
she
was
quite
unintentionally
an
interested
observer
of
their
little
interview
soames
usually
somewhat
pale
had
a
delightful
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
bosinney
manner
was
strange
though
attractive
she
thought
him
rather
a
man
and
george
name
for
him
which
there
was
something
charming
he
seemed
to
be
pleading
indeed
they
talked
so
rather
he
talked
so
earnestly
for
soames
did
not
say
they
caused
inconsiderately
an
eddy
in
the
traffic
one
nice
old
general
going
towards
cigars
was
obliged
to
step
quite
out
of
the
way
and
chancing
to
look
up
and
see
soames
face
he
actually
took
off
his
hat
the
old
fool
so
like
a
man
but
it
was
soames
eyes
that
worried
euphemia
she
never
once
looked
at
bosinney
until
he
moved
on
and
then
she
looked
after
him
and
oh
that
look
on
that
look
euphemia
had
spent
much
anxious
thought
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
it
had
hurt
her
with
its
dark
lingering
softness
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
woman
wanted
to
drag
him
back
and
unsay
something
she
had
been
saying
ah
well
she
had
had
no
time
to
go
deeply
into
the
matter
just
then
with
that
prunella
silk
on
her
hands
but
she
was
she
had
just
nodded
to
soames
to
show
her
that
she
had
seen
and
as
she
confided
in
talking
it
over
afterwards
to
her
chum
francie
roger
daughter
did
she
look
caught
out
just
james
most
averse
at
the
first
blush
to
accepting
any
news
confirmatory
of
his
own
poignant
suspicions
took
her
up
at
once
oh
he
said
they
be
after
no
euphemia
smiled
in
the
groceries
she
said
softly
and
taking
and
paregoric
from
the
table
added
and
so
you
lend
me
this
dear
auntie
and
went
away
james
left
almost
immediately
after
he
was
late
as
it
was
when
he
reached
the
office
of
forsyte
bustard
and
forsyte
he
found
soames
sitting
in
his
revolving
chair
drawing
up
a
defence
the
latter
greeted
his
father
with
a
curt
and
taking
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
said
it
may
interest
you
to
look
through
james
read
as
follows
sloane
street
may
forsyte
construction
of
your
house
being
now
completed
my
duties
as
architect
have
come
to
an
end
if
i
am
to
go
on
with
the
business
of
decoration
which
at
your
request
i
undertook
i
should
like
you
to
clearly
understand
that
i
must
have
a
free
hand
never
come
down
without
suggesting
something
that
goes
counter
to
my
scheme
i
have
here
three
letters
from
you
each
of
which
recommends
an
article
i
should
never
dream
of
putting
in
i
had
your
father
here
yesterday
afternoon
who
made
further
valuable
suggestions
make
up
your
mind
therefore
whether
you
want
me
to
decorate
for
you
or
to
retire
which
on
the
whole
i
should
prefer
to
do
understand
that
if
i
decorate
i
decorate
alone
without
interference
of
any
sort
if
i
do
the
thing
i
will
do
it
thoroughly
but
i
must
have
a
free
hand
truly
bosinney
the
exact
and
immediate
cause
of
this
letter
can
not
of
course
be
told
though
it
is
not
improbable
that
bosinney
may
have
been
moved
by
some
sudden
revolt
against
his
position
towards
eternal
position
of
art
towards
is
so
admirably
summed
up
on
the
back
of
the
most
indispensable
of
modern
appliances
in
a
sentence
comparable
to
the
very
finest
in
tacitus

sorrow
inventor

padland
proprietor
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
him
james
asked
soames
did
not
even
turn
his
head
i
have
made
up
my
mind
he
said
and
went
on
with
his
defence
a
client
of
his
having
put
some
buildings
on
a
piece
of
ground
that
did
not
belong
to
him
had
been
suddenly
and
most
irritatingly
warned
to
take
them
off
again
after
carefully
going
into
the
facts
however
soames
had
seen
his
way
to
advise
that
his
client
had
what
was
known
as
a
title
by
possession
and
that
though
undoubtedly
the
ground
did
not
belong
to
him
he
was
entitled
to
keep
it
and
had
better
do
so
and
he
was
now
following
up
this
advice
by
taking
steps
the
sailors
it
so
he
had
a
distinct
reputation
for
sound
advice
people
saying
of
him
go
to
young
fellow
and
he
prized
this
reputation
highly
his
natural
taciturnity
was
in
his
favour
nothing
could
be
more
calculated
to
give
people
especially
people
with
property
soames
had
no
other
clients
the
impression
that
he
was
a
safe
man
and
he
was
safe
tradition
habit
education
inherited
aptitude
native
caution
all
joined
to
form
a
solid
professional
honesty
superior
to
the
very
fact
that
it
was
built
on
an
innate
avoidance
of
risk
how
could
he
fall
when
his
soul
abhorred
circumstances
which
render
a
fall
man
can
not
fall
off
the
floor
and
those
countless
forsytes
who
in
the
course
of
innumerable
transactions
concerned
with
property
of
all
sorts
from
wives
to
water
rights
had
occasion
for
the
services
of
a
safe
man
found
it
both
reposeful
and
profitable
to
confide
in
soames
that
slight
superciliousness
of
his
combined
with
an
air
of
mousing
amongst
precedents
was
in
his
favour
man
would
not
be
supercilious
unless
he
knew
he
was
really
at
the
head
of
the
business
for
though
james
still
came
nearly
every
day
to
see
for
himself
he
did
little
now
but
sit
in
his
chair
twist
his
legs
slightly
confuse
things
already
decided
and
presently
go
away
again
and
the
other
partner
bustard
was
a
poor
thing
who
did
a
great
deal
of
work
but
whose
opinion
was
never
taken
so
soames
went
steadily
on
with
his
defence
yet
it
would
be
idle
to
say
that
his
mind
was
at
ease
he
was
suffering
from
a
sense
of
impending
trouble
that
had
haunted
him
for
some
time
past
he
tried
to
think
it
condition
of
his
knew
that
it
was
not
he
looked
at
his
watch
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
due
at
the
general
meeting
of
the
new
colliery
of
uncle
concerns
he
should
see
uncle
jolyon
there
and
say
something
to
him
about
had
not
made
up
his
mind
what
but
any
case
he
should
not
answer
this
letter
until
he
had
seen
uncle
jolyon
he
got
up
and
methodically
put
away
the
draft
of
his
defence
going
into
a
dark
little
cupboard
he
turned
up
the
light
washed
his
hands
with
a
piece
of
brown
windsor
soap
and
dried
them
on
a
roller
towel
then
he
brushed
his
hair
paying
strict
attention
to
the
parting
turned
down
the
light
took
his
hat
and
saying
he
would
be
back
at
two
stepped
into
the
poultry
it
was
not
far
to
the
offices
of
the
new
colliery
company
in
ironmonger
lane
where
and
not
at
the
cannon
street
hotel
in
accordance
with
the
more
ambitious
practice
of
other
companies
the
general
meeting
was
always
held
old
jolyon
had
from
the
first
set
his
face
against
the
press
what
the
public
with
his
concerns
soames
arrived
on
the
stroke
of
time
and
took
his
seat
alongside
the
board
who
in
a
row
each
director
behind
his
own
faced
their
shareholders
in
the
centre
of
this
row
old
jolyon
conspicuous
in
his
black
and
his
white
moustaches
was
leaning
back
with
finger
tips
crossed
on
a
copy
of
the
directors
report
and
accounts
on
his
right
hand
always
a
little
larger
than
life
sat
the
secretary
hemmings
an
sadness
beaming
in
his
fine
eyes
his
beard
in
mourning
like
the
rest
of
him
giving
the
feeling
of
an
tie
behind
it
the
occasion
indeed
was
a
melancholy
one
only
six
weeks
having
elapsed
since
that
telegram
had
come
from
scorrier
the
mining
expert
on
a
private
mission
to
the
mines
informing
them
that
pippin
their
superintendent
had
committed
suicide
in
endeavouring
after
his
extraordinary
two
years
silence
to
write
a
letter
to
his
board
that
letter
was
on
the
table
now
it
would
be
read
to
the
shareholders
who
would
of
course
be
put
into
possession
of
all
the
facts
hemmings
had
often
said
to
soames
standing
with
his
divided
before
the
fireplace
what
our
shareholders
do
know
about
our
affairs
is
worth
knowing
you
may
take
that
from
me
on
one
occasion
old
jolyon
being
present
soames
recollected
a
little
unpleasantness
his
uncle
had
looked
up
sharply
and
said
talk
nonsense
hemmings
you
mean
that
what
they
do
know
is
worth
knowing
old
jolyon
detested
humbug
hemmings
and
wearing
a
smile
like
that
of
a
trained
poodle
had
replied
in
an
outburst
of
artificial
applause
come
now
good
very
good
your
uncle
will
have
his
joke
the
next
time
he
had
seen
soames
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
saying
to
him
the
chairman
getting
very
old
ca
get
him
to
understand
things
and
he
so
what
can
you
expect
with
a
chin
like
his
soames
had
nodded
everyone
knew
that
uncle
jolyon
chin
was
a
caution
he
was
looking
worried
in
spite
of
his
general
meeting
look
he
soames
should
certainly
speak
to
him
about
bosinney
beyond
old
jolyon
on
the
left
was
little
booker
and
he
too
wore
his
general
meeting
look
as
though
searching
for
some
particularly
tender
shareholder
and
next
him
was
the
deaf
director
with
a
frown
and
beyond
the
deaf
director
again
was
old
bleedham
very
bland
and
having
an
air
of
conscious
well
he
might
knowing
that
the
parcel
he
always
brought
to
the
was
concealed
behind
his
hat
one
of
that
class
of
which
go
with
very
large
bow
ties
lips
fresh
cheeks
and
neat
little
white
whiskers
soames
always
attended
the
general
meeting
it
was
considered
better
that
he
should
do
so
in
case
should
arise
he
glanced
round
with
his
close
supercilious
air
at
the
walls
of
the
room
where
hung
plans
of
the
mine
and
harbour
together
with
a
large
photograph
of
a
shaft
leading
to
a
working
which
had
proved
quite
remarkably
unprofitable
this
witness
to
the
eternal
irony
underlying
commercial
retained
its
position
on
the
wall
an
effigy
of
the
directors
pet
but
dead
lamb
and
now
old
jolyon
rose
to
present
the
report
and
accounts
veiling
under
a
serenity
that
perpetual
antagonism
in
the
bosom
of
a
director
towards
his
shareholders
he
faced
them
calmly
soames
faced
them
too
he
knew
most
of
them
by
sight
there
was
old
scrubsole
a
tar
man
who
always
came
as
hemmings
would
say
make
himself
nasty
a
old
fellow
with
a
red
face
a
jowl
and
an
enormous
hat
reposing
on
his
knee
and
the
rev
boms
who
always
proposed
a
vote
of
thanks
to
the
chairman
in
which
he
invariably
expressed
the
hope
that
the
board
would
not
forget
to
elevate
their
employees
using
the
word
with
a
double
e
as
being
more
vigorous
and
he
had
the
strong
imperialistic
tendencies
of
his
cloth
it
was
his
salutary
custom
to
buttonhole
a
director
afterwards
and
ask
him
whether
he
thought
the
coming
year
would
be
good
or
bad
and
according
to
the
trend
of
the
answer
to
buy
or
sell
three
shares
within
the
ensuing
fortnight
and
there
was
that
military
man
major
who
could
not
help
speaking
if
only
to
second
the
of
the
auditor
and
who
sometimes
caused
serious
consternation
by
taking
of
the
hands
of
persons
who
had
been
flattered
with
little
slips
of
paper
entrusting
the
said
proposals
to
their
care
these
made
up
the
lot
together
with
four
or
five
strong
silent
shareholders
with
whom
soames
could
of
business
who
liked
to
keep
an
eye
on
their
affairs
for
themselves
without
being
solid
men
who
came
to
the
city
every
day
and
went
back
in
the
evening
to
good
solid
wives
good
solid
wives
there
was
something
in
that
thought
which
roused
the
nameless
uneasiness
in
soames
again
what
should
he
say
to
his
uncle
what
answer
should
he
make
to
this
letter
if
any
shareholder
has
any
question
to
put
i
shall
be
glad
to
answer
a
soft
thump
old
jolyon
had
let
the
report
and
accounts
fall
and
stood
twisting
his
glasses
between
thumb
and
forefinger
the
ghost
of
a
smile
appeared
on
soames
face
they
had
better
hurry
up
with
their
questions
he
well
knew
his
uncle
method
the
ideal
one
of
at
once
saying
i
propose
then
that
the
report
and
accounts
be
adopted
never
let
them
get
their
were
notoriously
wasteful
of
time
a
tall
man
with
a
gaunt
dissatisfied
face
arose
i
believe
i
am
in
order
chairman
in
raising
a
question
on
this
figure
of
in
the
accounts
the
widow
and
family
he
looked
sourly
round
our
late
superintendent
who
i
committed
suicide
at
a
time
when
his
services
were
of
the
utmost
value
to
this
company
you
have
stated
that
the
agreement
which
he
has
so
unfortunately
cut
short
with
his
own
hand
was
for
a
period
of
five
years
of
which
one
only
had
old
jolyon
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
i
believe
i
am
in
order
ask
whether
this
amount
paid
or
proposed
to
be
paid
by
the
board
to
the
for
services
which
might
have
been
rendered
to
the
he
not
committed
suicide
it
is
in
recognition
of
past
services
which
we
all
as
well
as
any
of
have
been
of
vital
then
sir
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
the
services
being
past
the
amount
is
too
the
shareholder
sat
down
old
jolyon
waited
a
second
and
said
i
now
propose
that
the
report
the
shareholder
rose
again
may
i
ask
if
the
board
realizes
that
it
is
not
their
money
do
hesitate
to
say
that
if
it
were
their
money
a
second
shareholder
with
a
round
dogged
face
whom
soames
recognised
as
the
late
superintendent
got
up
and
said
warmly
in
my
opinion
sir
the
sum
is
not
enough
the
rev
boms
now
rose
to
his
feet
if
i
may
venture
to
express
myself
he
said
i
should
say
that
the
fact
of
having
committed
suicide
should
weigh
very
heavily
with
our
worthy
chairman
i
have
no
doubt
it
has
weighed
with
him
say
this
for
myself
and
i
think
for
everyone
present
hear
hear
enjoys
our
confidence
in
a
high
degree
we
all
desire
i
should
hope
to
be
charitable
but
i
feel
sure
severely
at
the
late
superintendent
that
he
will
in
some
way
by
some
written
expression
or
better
perhaps
by
reducing
the
amount
record
our
grave
disapproval
that
so
promising
and
valuable
a
life
should
have
been
thus
impiously
removed
from
a
sphere
where
both
its
own
interests
i
may
say
interests
so
imperatively
demanded
its
continuance
we
should
we
may
so
grave
a
dereliction
of
all
duty
both
human
and
the
reverend
gentleman
resumed
his
seat
the
late
again
rose
what
i
have
said
i
stick
to
he
said
the
amount
is
not
enough
the
first
shareholder
struck
in
i
challenge
the
legality
of
the
payment
in
my
opinion
this
payment
is
not
legal
the
solicitor
is
present
i
believe
i
am
in
order
in
asking
him
the
all
eyes
were
now
turned
upon
soames
something
had
arisen
he
stood
up
and
cold
his
nerves
inwardly
fluttered
his
attention
tweaked
away
at
last
from
contemplation
of
that
cloud
looming
on
the
horizon
of
his
mind
the
point
he
said
in
a
low
thin
voice
is
by
no
means
clear
as
there
is
no
possibility
of
future
consideration
being
received
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
payment
is
strictly
legal
if
it
is
desired
the
opinion
of
the
court
could
be
the
superintendent
frowned
and
said
in
a
meaning
tone
we
have
no
doubt
the
opinion
of
the
court
could
be
taken
may
i
ask
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
has
given
us
that
striking
piece
of
information
soames
forsyte
indeed
he
looked
from
soames
to
old
jolyon
in
a
pointed
manner
a
flush
coloured
soames
pale
cheeks
but
his
superciliousness
did
not
waver
old
jolyon
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
speaker
if
he
said
the
late
superintendents
has
nothing
more
to
say
i
propose
that
the
report
and
accounts
at
this
moment
however
there
rose
one
of
those
five
silent
stolid
shareholders
who
had
excited
soames
sympathy
he
said
i
deprecate
the
proposal
altogether
we
are
expected
to
give
charity
to
this
man
wife
and
children
who
you
tell
us
were
dependent
on
him
they
may
have
been
i
do
not
care
whether
they
were
or
not
i
object
to
the
whole
thing
on
principle
it
is
high
time
a
stand
was
made
against
this
sentimental
humanitarianism
the
country
is
eaten
up
with
it
i
object
to
my
money
being
paid
to
these
people
of
whom
i
know
nothing
who
have
done
nothing
to
earn
it
i
object
in
toto
it
is
not
business
i
now
move
that
the
report
and
accounts
be
put
back
and
amended
by
striking
out
the
grant
old
jolyon
had
remained
standing
while
the
strong
silent
man
was
speaking
the
speech
awoke
an
echo
in
all
hearts
voicing
as
it
did
the
worship
of
strong
men
the
movement
against
generosity
which
had
at
that
time
already
commenced
among
the
saner
members
of
the
community
the
words
is
not
business
had
moved
even
the
board
privately
everyone
felt
that
indeed
it
was
not
but
they
knew
also
the
domineering
temper
and
tenacity
he
too
at
heart
must
feel
that
it
was
not
business
but
he
was
committed
to
his
own
proposition
would
he
go
back
upon
it
it
was
thought
to
be
unlikely
all
waited
with
interest
old
jolyon
held
up
his
hand
glasses
depending
between
his
finger
and
thumb
quivered
slightly
with
a
suggestion
of
menace
he
addressed
the
strong
silent
shareholder
knowing
as
you
do
the
efforts
of
our
late
superintendent
upon
the
occasion
of
the
explosion
at
the
mines
do
you
seriously
wish
me
to
put
that
amendment
sir
i
old
jolyon
put
the
amendment
does
anyone
second
this
he
asked
looking
calmly
round
and
it
was
then
that
soames
looking
at
his
uncle
felt
the
power
of
will
that
was
in
that
old
man
no
one
stirred
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
strong
silent
shareholder
old
jolyon
said
i
now
move
the
report
and
accounts
for
the
year
be
received
and
adopted
you
second
that
those
in
favour
signify
the
same
in
the
usual
way
carried
the
next
business
gentlemen
soames
smiled
certainly
uncle
jolyon
had
a
way
with
him
but
now
his
attention
relapsed
upon
bosinney
odd
how
that
fellow
haunted
his
thoughts
even
in
business
hours
irene
visit
to
the
there
was
nothing
in
that
except
that
she
might
have
told
him
but
then
again
she
never
did
tell
him
anything
she
was
more
silent
more
touchy
every
day
he
wished
to
god
the
house
were
finished
and
they
were
in
it
away
from
london
town
did
not
suit
her
her
nerves
were
not
strong
enough
that
nonsense
of
the
separate
room
had
cropped
up
again
the
meeting
was
breaking
up
now
underneath
the
photograph
of
the
lost
shaft
hemmings
was
buttonholed
by
the
rev
boms
little
booker
his
bristling
eyebrows
wreathed
in
angry
smiles
was
having
a
parting
with
old
scrubsole
the
two
hated
each
other
like
poison
there
was
some
matter
of
a
between
them
little
booker
having
secured
it
from
the
board
for
a
nephew
of
his
over
old
head
soames
had
heard
that
from
hemmings
who
liked
a
gossip
more
especially
about
his
directors
except
indeed
old
jolyon
of
whom
he
was
afraid
soames
awaited
his
opportunity
the
last
shareholder
was
vanishing
through
the
door
when
he
approached
his
uncle
who
was
putting
on
his
hat
can
i
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
uncle
jolyon
it
is
uncertain
what
soames
expected
to
get
out
of
this
interview
apart
from
that
somewhat
mysterious
awe
in
which
forsytes
in
general
held
old
jolyon
due
to
his
philosophic
twist
or
hemmings
would
doubtless
have
his
chin
there
was
and
always
had
been
a
subtle
antagonism
between
the
younger
man
and
the
old
it
had
lurked
under
their
dry
manner
of
greeting
under
their
allusions
to
each
other
and
arose
perhaps
from
old
jolyon
perception
of
the
quiet
tenacity
he
rather
naturally
called
it
of
the
young
man
of
a
secret
doubt
whether
he
could
get
his
own
way
with
him
both
these
forsytes
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
in
many
respects
possessed
in
their
different
a
greater
degree
than
the
rest
of
the
essential
quality
of
tenacious
and
prudent
insight
into
which
is
the
highwater
mark
of
their
great
class
either
of
them
with
a
little
luck
and
opportunity
was
equal
to
a
lofty
career
either
of
them
would
have
made
a
good
financier
a
great
contractor
a
statesman
though
old
jolyon
in
certain
of
his
moods
when
under
the
influence
of
a
cigar
or
of
have
been
capable
of
not
perhaps
despising
but
certainly
of
questioning
his
own
high
position
while
soames
who
never
smoked
cigars
would
not
then
too
in
old
jolyon
mind
there
was
always
the
secret
ache
that
the
son
of
james
whom
he
had
always
thought
such
a
poor
thing
should
be
pursuing
the
paths
of
success
while
his
own
son
and
last
not
he
was
no
more
outside
the
radiation
of
family
gossip
than
any
other
had
now
heard
the
sinister
indefinite
but
none
the
less
disturbing
rumour
about
bosinney
and
his
pride
was
wounded
to
the
quick
characteristically
his
irritation
turned
not
against
irene
but
against
soames
the
idea
that
his
nephew
wife
why
could
the
fellow
take
better
care
of
quaint
injustice
as
though
soames
could
possibly
take
more
care
be
drawing
to
herself
june
lover
was
intolerably
humiliating
and
seeing
the
danger
he
did
not
like
james
hide
it
away
in
sheer
nervousness
but
owned
with
the
dispassion
of
his
broader
outlook
that
it
was
not
unlikely
there
was
something
very
attractive
about
irene
he
had
a
presentiment
on
the
subject
of
soames
communication
as
they
left
the
board
room
together
and
went
out
into
the
noise
and
hurry
of
cheapside
they
walked
together
a
good
minute
without
speaking
soames
with
his
mousing
mincing
step
and
old
jolyon
upright
and
using
his
umbrella
languidly
as
a
they
turned
presently
into
comparative
quiet
for
old
jolyon
way
to
a
second
board
led
him
in
the
direction
of
moorage
street
then
soames
without
lifting
his
eyes
began
i
had
this
letter
from
bosinney
you
see
what
he
says
i
thought
i
let
you
know
i
spent
a
lot
more
than
i
intended
on
this
house
and
i
want
the
position
to
be
old
jolyon
ran
his
eyes
unwillingly
over
the
letter
what
he
says
is
clear
enough
he
said
he
talks
about
free
hand
replied
soames
old
jolyon
looked
at
him
the
irritation
and
antagonism
towards
this
young
fellow
whose
affairs
were
beginning
to
intrude
upon
his
own
burst
from
him
well
if
you
do
trust
him
why
do
you
employ
him
soames
stole
a
sideway
look
it
much
too
late
to
go
into
that
he
said
i
only
want
it
to
be
quite
understood
that
if
i
give
him
a
free
hand
he
does
let
me
in
i
thought
if
you
were
to
speak
to
him
it
would
carry
more
weight
no
said
old
jolyon
abruptly
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
words
of
both
uncle
and
nephew
gave
the
impression
of
unspoken
meanings
far
more
important
behind
and
the
look
they
interchanged
was
like
a
revelation
of
this
consciousness
well
said
soames
i
thought
for
june
sake
i
tell
you
all
i
thought
you
better
know
i
sha
stand
any
nonsense
what
is
that
to
me
old
jolyon
took
him
up
oh
i
do
know
said
soames
and
flurried
by
that
sharp
look
he
was
unable
to
say
more
do
say
i
did
tell
you
he
added
sulkily
recovering
his
composure
tell
me
said
old
jolyon
i
do
know
what
you
mean
you
come
worrying
me
about
a
thing
like
this
i
do
want
to
hear
about
your
affairs
you
must
manage
them
yourself
very
well
said
soames
immovably
i
will
then
said
old
jolyon
and
they
parted
soames
retraced
his
steps
and
going
into
a
celebrated
asked
for
a
plate
of
smoked
salmon
and
a
glass
of
chablis
he
seldom
ate
much
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
generally
ate
standing
finding
the
position
beneficial
to
his
liver
which
was
very
sound
but
to
which
he
desired
to
put
down
all
his
troubles
when
he
had
finished
he
went
slowly
back
to
his
office
with
bent
head
taking
no
notice
of
the
swarming
thousands
on
the
pavements
who
in
their
turn
took
no
notice
of
him
the
evening
post
carried
the
following
reply
to
bosinney
bustard
and
forsyte
for
oaths
branch
lane
poultry
bosinney
have
received
your
letter
the
terms
of
which
not
a
little
surprise
me
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
had
and
have
had
all
along
a
free
hand
for
i
do
not
recollect
that
any
suggestions
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
make
have
met
with
your
approval
in
giving
you
in
accordance
with
your
request
this
free
hand
i
wish
you
to
clearly
understand
that
the
total
cost
of
the
house
as
handed
over
to
me
completely
decorated
inclusive
of
your
fee
as
arranged
between
us
must
not
exceed
twelve
thousand
this
gives
you
an
ample
margin
and
as
you
know
is
far
more
than
i
originally
contemplated
am
truly
forsyte
on
the
following
day
he
received
a
note
from
bosinney
baynes
bosinney
sloane
street
forsyte
you
think
that
in
such
a
delicate
matter
as
decoration
i
can
bind
myself
to
the
exact
pound
i
am
afraid
you
are
mistaken
i
can
see
that
you
are
tired
of
the
arrangement
and
of
me
and
i
had
better
therefore
resign
faithfully
baynes
bosinney
soames
pondered
long
and
painfully
over
his
answer
and
late
at
night
in
the
when
irene
had
gone
to
bed
he
composed
the
following
montpellier
square
bosinney
think
that
in
both
our
interests
it
would
be
extremely
undesirable
that
matters
should
be
so
left
at
this
stage
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
if
you
should
exceed
the
sum
named
in
my
letter
to
you
by
ten
or
twenty
or
even
fifty
pounds
there
would
be
any
difficulty
between
us
this
being
so
i
should
like
you
to
reconsider
your
answer
you
have
a
free
hand
in
the
terms
of
this
correspondence
and
i
hope
you
will
see
your
way
to
completing
the
decorations
in
the
matter
of
which
i
know
it
is
difficult
to
be
absolutely
exact
truly
forsyte
bosinney
answer
which
came
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
was
forsyte
well
bosinney
chapter
jolyon
at
the
zoo
old
jolyon
disposed
of
his
second
ordinary
he
was
so
dictatorial
that
his
fellow
directors
were
left
in
cabal
over
the
increasing
domineeringness
of
old
forsyte
which
they
were
far
from
intending
to
stand
much
longer
they
said
he
went
out
by
underground
to
portland
road
station
whence
he
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
zoo
he
had
an
assignation
there
one
of
those
assignations
that
had
lately
been
growing
more
frequent
to
which
his
increasing
uneasiness
about
june
and
the
in
her
as
he
expressed
it
was
driving
him
she
buried
herself
away
and
was
growing
thin
if
he
spoke
to
her
he
got
no
answer
or
had
his
head
snapped
off
or
she
looked
as
if
she
would
burst
into
tears
she
was
as
changed
as
she
could
be
all
through
this
bosinney
as
for
telling
him
about
anything
not
a
bit
of
it
and
he
would
sit
for
long
spells
brooding
his
paper
unread
before
him
a
cigar
extinct
between
his
lips
she
had
been
such
a
companion
to
him
ever
since
she
was
three
years
old
and
he
loved
her
so
forces
regardless
of
family
or
class
or
custom
were
beating
down
his
guard
impending
events
over
which
he
had
no
control
threw
their
shadows
on
his
head
the
irritation
of
one
accustomed
to
have
his
way
was
roused
against
he
knew
not
what
chafing
at
the
slowness
of
his
cab
he
reached
the
zoo
door
but
with
his
sunny
instinct
for
seizing
the
good
of
each
moment
he
forgot
his
vexation
as
he
walked
towards
the
tryst
from
the
stone
terrace
above
the
his
son
and
his
two
grandchildren
came
hastening
down
when
they
saw
old
jolyon
coming
and
led
him
away
towards
the
they
supported
him
on
either
side
holding
one
to
each
of
his
hands
jolly
perverse
like
his
father
carried
his
grandfather
umbrella
in
such
a
way
as
to
catch
people
legs
with
the
crutch
of
the
handle
young
jolyon
followed
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
his
father
with
the
children
but
such
a
play
as
brings
smiles
with
tears
behind
an
old
man
and
two
small
children
walking
together
can
be
seen
at
any
hour
of
the
day
but
the
sight
of
old
jolyon
with
jolly
and
holly
seemed
to
young
jolyon
a
special
of
the
things
that
lie
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
the
complete
surrender
of
that
erect
old
figure
to
those
little
figures
on
either
hand
was
too
poignantly
tender
and
being
a
man
of
an
habitual
reflex
action
young
jolyon
swore
softly
under
his
breath
the
show
affected
him
in
a
way
unbecoming
to
a
forsyte
who
is
nothing
if
not
undemonstrative
thus
they
reached
the
there
had
been
a
morning
fete
at
the
botanical
gardens
and
a
large
number
of
forsy
is
of
people
who
kept
carriages
had
brought
them
on
to
the
zoo
so
as
to
have
more
if
possible
for
their
money
before
going
back
to
rutland
gate
or
bryanston
square
let
go
on
to
the
zoo
they
had
said
to
each
other
it
be
great
fun
it
was
a
shilling
day
and
there
would
not
be
all
those
horrid
common
people
in
front
of
the
long
line
of
cages
they
were
collected
in
rows
watching
the
tawny
ravenous
beasts
behind
the
bars
await
their
only
pleasure
of
the
hours
the
hungrier
the
beast
the
greater
the
fascination
but
whether
because
the
spectators
envied
his
appetite
or
more
humanely
because
it
was
so
soon
to
be
satisfied
young
jolyon
could
not
tell
remarks
kept
falling
on
his
ears
that
a
brute
that
tiger
oh
what
a
love
look
at
his
little
mouth
yes
he
rather
nice
do
go
too
near
and
frequently
with
little
pats
one
or
another
would
clap
their
hands
to
their
pockets
behind
and
look
round
as
though
expecting
young
jolyon
or
some
person
to
relieve
them
of
the
contents
a
man
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
slowly
through
his
teeth
all
greed
they
ca
be
hungry
why
they
take
no
at
these
words
a
tiger
snatched
a
piece
of
bleeding
liver
and
the
fat
man
laughed
his
wife
in
a
paris
model
frock
and
gold
reproved
him
how
can
you
laugh
harry
such
a
horrid
sight
young
jolyon
frowned
the
circumstances
of
his
life
though
he
had
ceased
to
take
a
too
personal
view
of
them
had
left
him
subject
to
an
intermittent
contempt
and
the
class
to
which
he
had
carriage
excited
his
sarcasm
to
shut
up
a
lion
or
tiger
in
confinement
was
surely
a
horrible
barbarity
but
no
cultivated
person
would
admit
this
the
idea
of
its
being
barbarous
to
confine
wild
animals
had
probably
never
even
occurred
to
his
father
for
instance
he
belonged
to
the
old
school
who
considered
it
at
once
humanizing
and
educational
to
confine
baboons
and
panthers
holding
the
view
no
doubt
that
in
course
of
time
they
might
induce
these
creatures
not
so
unreasonably
to
die
of
misery
and
against
the
bars
of
their
cages
and
put
the
society
to
the
expense
of
getting
others
in
his
eyes
as
in
the
eyes
of
all
forsytes
the
pleasure
of
seeing
these
beautiful
creatures
in
a
state
of
captivity
far
outweighed
the
inconvenience
of
imprisonment
to
beasts
whom
god
had
so
improvidently
placed
in
a
state
of
freedom
it
was
for
the
animals
good
removing
them
at
once
from
the
countless
dangers
of
open
air
and
exercise
and
enabling
them
to
exercise
their
functions
in
the
guaranteed
seclusion
of
a
private
compartment
indeed
it
was
doubtful
what
wild
animals
were
made
for
but
to
be
shut
up
in
cages
but
as
young
jolyon
had
in
his
constitution
the
elements
of
impartiality
he
reflected
that
to
stigmatize
as
barbarity
that
which
was
merely
lack
of
imagination
must
be
wrong
for
none
who
held
these
views
had
been
placed
in
a
similar
position
to
the
animals
they
caged
and
could
not
therefore
be
expected
to
enter
into
their
sensations
it
was
not
until
they
were
leaving
the
and
holly
in
a
state
of
blissful
old
jolyon
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
his
son
on
the
matter
next
his
heart
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
he
said
if
she
to
go
on
as
she
going
on
now
i
ca
tell
to
come
i
wanted
her
to
see
the
doctor
but
she
wo
she
not
a
bit
like
me
she
your
mother
all
over
obstinate
as
a
mule
if
she
want
to
do
a
thing
she
wo
and
there
an
end
of
it
young
jolyon
smiled
his
eyes
had
wandered
to
his
father
chin
pair
of
you
he
thought
but
he
said
nothing
and
then
went
on
old
jolyon
there
this
bosinney
i
should
like
to
punch
the
fellow
head
but
i
ca
i
suppose
do
see
why
you
should
he
added
doubtfully
what
has
he
done
far
better
that
it
should
come
to
an
end
if
they
do
hit
it
off
old
jolyon
looked
at
his
son
now
they
had
actually
come
to
discuss
a
subject
connected
with
the
relations
between
the
sexes
he
felt
distrustful
jo
would
be
sure
to
hold
some
loose
view
or
other
well
i
do
know
what
you
think
he
said
i
dare
say
your
sympathy
with
be
surprised
but
i
think
he
behaving
precious
badly
and
if
he
comes
my
way
i
shall
tell
him
he
dropped
the
subject
it
was
impossible
to
discuss
with
his
son
the
true
nature
and
meaning
of
bosinney
defection
had
not
his
son
done
the
very
same
thing
worse
if
possible
fifteen
years
ago
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
consequences
of
that
piece
of
folly
young
jolyon
also
was
silent
he
had
quickly
penetrated
his
thought
for
dethroned
from
the
high
seat
of
an
obvious
and
uncomplicated
view
of
things
he
had
become
both
perceptive
and
subtle
the
attitude
he
had
adopted
towards
sexual
matters
fifteen
years
before
however
was
too
different
from
his
father
there
was
no
bridging
the
gulf
he
said
coolly
i
suppose
he
fallen
in
love
with
some
other
woman
old
jolyon
gave
him
a
dubious
look
i
ca
tell
he
said
they
say
so
then
it
probably
true
remarked
young
jolyon
unexpectedly
and
i
suppose
they
told
you
who
she
is
yes
said
old
jolyon
soames
wife
young
jolyon
did
not
whistle
the
circumstances
of
his
own
life
had
rendered
him
incapable
of
whistling
on
such
a
subject
but
he
looked
at
his
father
while
the
ghost
of
a
smile
hovered
over
his
face
if
old
jolyon
saw
he
took
no
notice
she
and
june
were
bosom
friends
he
muttered
poor
little
june
said
young
jolyon
softly
he
thought
of
his
daughter
still
as
a
babe
of
three
old
jolyon
came
to
a
sudden
halt
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
he
said
it
some
old
woman
tale
get
me
a
cab
jo
i
tired
to
death
they
stood
at
a
corner
to
see
if
an
empty
cab
would
come
along
while
carriage
after
carriage
drove
past
bearing
forsytes
of
all
descriptions
from
the
zoo
the
harness
the
liveries
the
gloss
on
the
horses
coats
shone
and
glittered
in
the
may
sunlight
and
each
equipage
landau
sociable
barouche
victoria
or
brougham
seemed
to
roll
out
proudly
from
its
wheels
and
my
horses
and
my
men
you
know
indeed
the
whole
have
cost
a
pot
but
we
were
worth
it
every
penny
look
at
master
and
at
missis
now
the
dawgs
ease
with
that
the
ticket
and
such
as
everyone
knows
is
fit
accompaniment
for
a
perambulating
forsyte
amongst
these
carriages
was
a
barouche
coming
at
a
greater
pace
than
the
others
drawn
by
a
pair
of
bright
bay
horses
it
swung
on
its
high
springs
and
the
four
people
who
filled
it
seemed
rocked
as
in
a
cradle
this
chariot
attracted
young
jolyon
attention
and
suddenly
on
the
back
seat
he
recognised
his
uncle
james
unmistakable
in
spite
of
the
increased
whiteness
of
his
whiskers
opposite
their
backs
defended
by
sunshades
rachel
forsyte
and
her
elder
but
married
sister
winifred
dartie
in
irreproachable
toilettes
had
posed
their
heads
haughtily
like
two
of
the
birds
they
had
been
seeing
at
the
zoo
while
by
side
reclined
dartie
in
a
buttoned
tight
and
square
with
a
large
expanse
of
carefully
shot
linen
protruding
below
each
wristband
an
extra
if
subdued
sparkle
an
added
touch
of
the
best
gloss
or
varnish
characterized
this
vehicle
and
seemed
to
distinguish
it
from
all
the
others
as
though
by
some
happy
that
which
marks
out
the
real
of
art
from
the
ordinary
were
designated
as
the
typical
car
the
very
throne
of
forsytedom
old
jolyon
did
not
see
them
pass
he
was
petting
poor
holly
who
was
tired
but
those
in
the
carriage
had
taken
in
the
little
group
the
ladies
heads
tilted
suddenly
there
was
a
spasmodic
screening
movement
of
parasols
james
face
protruded
naively
like
the
head
of
a
long
bird
his
mouth
slowly
opening
the
rounds
of
the
parasols
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
vanished
young
jolyon
saw
that
he
had
been
recognised
even
by
winifred
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
fifteen
when
he
had
forfeited
the
right
to
be
considered
a
forsyte
there
was
not
much
change
in
them
he
remembered
the
exact
look
of
their
all
that
time
ago
horses
men
different
now
no
of
the
precise
stamp
of
fifteen
years
before
the
same
neat
display
the
same
nicely
calculated
arrogance
ease
with
security
the
swing
exact
the
pose
of
the
sunshades
exact
exact
the
spirit
of
the
whole
thing
and
in
the
sunlight
defended
by
the
haughty
shields
of
parasols
carriage
after
carriage
went
by
uncle
james
has
just
passed
with
his
female
folk
said
young
jolyon
his
father
looked
black
did
your
uncle
see
us
yes
hmph
what
he
want
coming
down
into
these
parts
an
empty
cab
drove
up
at
this
moment
and
old
jolyon
stopped
it
i
shall
see
you
again
before
long
my
boy
he
said
do
you
go
paying
any
attention
to
what
i
been
saying
about
young
do
believe
a
word
of
it
kissing
the
children
who
tried
to
detain
him
he
stepped
in
and
was
borne
away
young
jolyon
who
had
taken
holly
up
in
his
arms
stood
motionless
at
the
corner
looking
after
the
cab
chapter
at
if
old
jolyon
as
he
got
into
his
cab
had
said
wo
believe
a
word
of
it
he
would
more
truthfully
have
expressed
his
sentiments
the
notion
that
james
and
his
womankind
had
seen
him
in
the
company
of
his
son
had
awakened
in
him
not
only
the
impatience
he
always
felt
when
crossed
but
that
secret
hostility
natural
between
brothers
the
roots
of
nursery
toughen
and
deepen
as
life
goes
on
and
all
hidden
support
a
plant
capable
of
producing
in
season
the
bitterest
fruits
hitherto
there
had
been
between
these
six
brothers
no
more
unfriendly
feeling
than
that
caused
by
the
secret
and
natural
doubt
that
the
others
might
be
richer
than
themselves
a
feeling
increased
to
the
pitch
of
curiosity
by
the
approach
of
end
of
all
the
great
of
their
man
of
business
who
with
some
sagacity
would
profess
to
nicholas
ignorance
of
james
income
to
james
ignorance
of
old
jolyon
to
jolyon
ignorance
of
roger
to
roger
ignorance
of
swithin
while
to
swithin
he
would
say
most
irritatingly
that
nicholas
must
be
a
rich
man
timothy
alone
was
exempt
being
in
securities
but
now
between
two
of
them
at
least
had
arisen
a
very
different
sense
of
injury
from
the
moment
when
james
had
the
impertinence
to
pry
into
his
he
put
jolyon
no
longer
chose
to
credit
this
story
about
bosinney
his
slighted
through
a
member
of
fellow
family
he
made
up
his
mind
that
bosinney
was
maligned
there
must
be
some
other
reason
for
his
defection
june
had
flown
out
at
him
or
something
she
was
as
touchy
as
she
could
be
he
would
however
let
timothy
have
a
bit
of
his
mind
and
see
if
he
would
go
on
dropping
hints
and
he
would
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
either
he
would
go
there
at
once
and
take
very
good
care
that
he
did
have
to
go
again
on
the
same
errand
he
saw
james
carriage
blocking
the
pavement
in
front
of
bower
so
they
had
got
there
before
about
having
seen
him
he
dared
say
and
further
on
swithin
greys
were
turning
their
noses
towards
the
noses
of
james
bays
as
though
in
conclave
over
the
family
while
their
coachmen
were
in
conclave
above
old
jolyon
depositing
his
hat
on
the
chair
in
the
narrow
hall
where
that
hat
of
bosinney
had
so
long
ago
been
mistaken
for
a
cat
passed
his
thin
hand
grimly
over
his
face
with
its
great
drooping
white
moustaches
as
though
to
remove
all
traces
of
expression
and
made
his
way
upstairs
he
found
the
front
full
it
was
full
enough
at
the
best
of
any
one
in
timothy
and
his
sisters
following
the
tradition
of
their
generation
considered
that
a
room
was
not
quite
unless
it
was
furnished
it
held
therefore
eleven
chairs
a
sofa
three
tables
two
cabinets
innumerable
knicknacks
and
part
of
a
large
grand
piano
and
now
occupied
by
small
aunt
hester
by
swithin
james
rachel
winifred
euphemia
who
had
come
in
again
to
return
and
paregoric
which
she
had
read
at
lunch
and
her
chum
frances
daughter
the
musical
forsyte
the
one
who
composed
songs
there
was
only
one
chair
left
unoccupied
except
of
course
the
two
that
nobody
ever
sat
the
only
standing
room
was
occupied
by
the
cat
on
whom
old
jolyon
promptly
stepped
in
these
days
it
was
by
no
means
unusual
for
timothy
to
have
so
many
visitors
the
family
had
always
one
and
all
had
a
real
respect
for
aunt
ann
and
now
that
she
was
gone
they
were
coming
far
more
frequently
to
the
bower
and
staying
longer
swithin
had
been
the
first
to
arrive
and
seated
torpid
in
a
red
satin
chair
with
a
gilt
back
he
gave
every
appearance
of
lasting
the
others
out
and
symbolizing
bosinney
name
big
one
with
his
great
stature
and
bulk
his
thick
white
hair
his
puffy
immovable
shaven
face
he
looked
more
primeval
than
ever
in
the
highly
upholstered
room
his
conversation
as
usual
of
late
had
turned
at
once
upon
irene
and
he
had
lost
no
time
in
giving
aunts
juley
and
hester
his
opinion
with
regard
to
this
rumour
he
heard
was
going
about
he
might
want
a
bit
of
pretty
woman
must
have
her
fling
but
more
than
that
he
did
not
believe
nothing
open
she
had
too
much
good
sense
too
much
proper
appreciation
of
what
was
due
to
her
position
and
to
the
family
no
he
was
going
to
say
but
the
very
idea
was
so
preposterous
that
he
waved
his
hand
as
though
to
let
that
pass
granted
that
swithin
took
a
bachelor
view
of
the
what
indeed
was
not
due
to
that
family
in
which
so
many
had
done
so
well
for
themselves
had
attained
a
certain
position
if
he
had
heard
in
dark
pessimistic
moments
the
words
and
small
beer
used
in
connection
with
his
origin
did
he
believe
them
no
he
cherished
hugging
it
pathetically
to
his
bosom
the
secret
theory
that
there
was
something
distinguished
somewhere
in
his
ancestry
must
be
he
once
said
to
young
jolyon
before
the
latter
went
to
the
bad
look
at
us
we
got
on
there
must
be
good
blood
in
us
he
had
been
fond
of
young
jolyon
the
boy
had
been
in
a
good
set
at
college
had
known
that
old
ruffian
sir
charles
fiste
pretty
rascal
one
of
them
had
turned
out
too
and
there
was
style
about
was
a
thousand
pities
he
had
run
off
with
that
governess
if
he
must
go
off
like
that
why
could
he
have
chosen
someone
who
would
have
done
them
credit
and
what
was
he
now
underwriter
at
lloyd
they
said
he
even
painted
damme
he
might
have
ended
as
sir
jolyon
forsyte
with
a
seat
in
parliament
and
a
place
in
the
country
it
was
swithin
who
following
the
impulse
which
sooner
or
later
urges
thereto
some
member
of
every
great
family
went
to
the
heralds
office
where
they
assured
him
that
he
was
undoubtedly
of
the
same
family
as
the
forsites
with
an
whose
arms
were
dexter
buckles
on
a
sable
ground
gules
hoping
no
doubt
to
get
him
to
take
them
up
swithin
however
did
not
do
this
but
having
ascertained
that
the
crest
was
a
proper
and
the
motto
forsite
he
had
the
pheasant
proper
placed
upon
his
carriage
and
the
buttons
of
his
coachman
and
both
crest
and
motto
on
his
the
arms
he
hugged
to
himself
partly
because
not
having
paid
for
them
he
thought
it
would
look
ostentatious
to
put
them
on
his
carriage
and
he
hated
ostentation
and
partly
because
he
like
any
practical
man
all
over
the
country
had
a
secret
dislike
and
contempt
for
things
he
could
not
understand
he
found
it
hard
as
anyone
might
to
swallow
dexter
buckles
on
a
sable
ground
gules
he
never
forgot
however
their
having
told
him
that
if
he
paid
for
them
he
would
be
entitled
to
use
them
and
it
strengthened
his
conviction
that
he
was
a
gentleman
imperceptibly
the
rest
of
the
family
absorbed
the
proper
and
some
more
serious
than
others
adopted
the
motto
old
jolyon
however
refused
to
use
the
latter
saying
that
it
was
humbug
meaning
nothing
so
far
as
he
could
see
among
the
older
generation
it
was
perhaps
known
at
bottom
from
what
great
historical
event
they
derived
their
crest
and
if
pressed
on
the
subject
sooner
than
tell
a
did
not
like
telling
lies
having
an
impression
that
only
frenchmen
and
russians
told
would
confess
hurriedly
that
swithin
had
got
hold
of
it
somehow
among
the
younger
generation
the
matter
was
wrapped
in
a
discretion
proper
they
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
their
elders
nor
to
feel
ridiculous
themselves
they
simply
used
the
crest
no
said
swithin
he
had
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
for
himself
and
what
he
should
say
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
to
that
young
buccaneer
or
bosinney
or
whatever
his
name
was
different
from
her
manner
to
himself
in
fact
he
should
rather
say
but
here
the
entrance
of
frances
and
euphemia
put
an
unfortunate
stop
to
the
conversation
for
this
was
not
a
subject
which
could
be
discussed
before
young
people
and
though
swithin
was
somewhat
upset
at
being
stopped
like
this
on
the
point
of
saying
something
important
he
soon
recovered
his
affability
he
was
rather
fond
of
as
she
was
called
in
the
family
she
was
so
smart
and
they
told
him
she
made
a
pretty
little
pot
of
by
her
songs
he
called
it
very
clever
of
her
he
rather
prided
himself
indeed
on
a
liberal
attitude
towards
women
not
seeing
any
reason
why
they
should
paint
pictures
or
write
tunes
or
books
even
for
the
matter
of
that
especially
if
they
could
turn
a
useful
penny
by
it
not
at
them
out
of
mischief
it
was
not
as
if
they
were
men
francie
as
she
was
usually
called
with
contempt
was
an
important
personage
if
only
as
a
standing
illustration
of
the
attitude
of
forsytes
towards
the
arts
she
was
not
really
but
rather
tall
with
dark
hair
for
a
forsyte
which
together
with
a
grey
eye
gave
her
what
was
called
celtic
appearance
she
wrote
songs
with
titles
like
sighs
or
me
mother
ere
i
die
with
a
refrain
like
an
anthem
me
mother
ere
i
die
kiss
me
mother
ah
kiss
ah
kiss
me
kiss
me
mother
ere
i
she
wrote
the
words
to
them
herself
and
other
poems
in
lighter
moments
she
wrote
waltzes
one
of
which
the
coil
was
almost
national
to
kensington
having
a
sweet
dip
in
it
it
was
very
original
then
there
were
her
for
little
people
at
once
educational
and
witty
especially
porgie
and
that
ditty
almost
prophetically
imbued
with
the
coming
imperial
spirit
entitled
him
in
his
little
eye
any
publisher
would
take
these
and
reviews
like
living
and
the
genteel
guide
went
into
raptures
over
of
miss
francie
forsyte
spirited
ditties
sparkling
and
pathetic
we
ourselves
were
moved
to
tears
and
laughter
miss
forsyte
should
go
far
with
the
true
instinct
of
her
breed
francie
had
made
a
point
of
knowing
the
right
who
would
write
about
her
and
talk
about
her
and
people
in
society
a
mental
register
of
just
where
to
exert
her
fascinations
and
an
eye
on
that
steady
scale
of
rising
prices
which
in
her
mind
eye
represented
the
future
in
this
way
she
caused
herself
to
be
universally
respected
once
at
a
time
when
her
emotions
were
whipped
by
an
the
tenor
of
roger
life
with
its
collection
of
house
property
had
induced
in
his
only
daughter
a
tendency
towards
turned
to
great
and
sincere
work
choosing
the
sonata
form
for
the
violin
this
was
the
only
one
of
her
productions
that
troubled
the
forsytes
they
felt
at
once
that
it
would
not
sell
roger
who
liked
having
a
clever
daughter
well
enough
and
often
alluded
to
the
amount
of
she
made
for
herself
was
upset
by
this
violin
sonata
rubbish
like
that
he
called
it
francie
had
borrowed
young
flageoletti
from
euphemia
to
play
it
in
the
at
gardens
as
a
matter
of
fact
roger
was
right
it
was
rubbish
the
sort
of
rubbish
that
would
sell
as
every
forsyte
knows
rubbish
that
sells
is
not
rubbish
at
from
it
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
sound
common
sense
which
fixed
the
worth
of
art
at
what
it
would
fetch
some
of
the
hester
for
instance
who
had
always
been
not
help
regretting
that
music
was
not
the
same
with
her
poems
but
then
as
aunt
hester
said
they
did
see
any
poetry
nowadays
all
the
poems
were
light
things
there
was
nobody
who
could
write
a
poem
like
lost
or
harold
either
of
which
made
you
feel
that
you
really
had
read
something
still
it
was
nice
for
francie
to
have
something
to
occupy
her
while
other
girls
were
spending
money
shopping
she
was
making
it
and
both
aunt
hester
and
aunt
juley
were
always
ready
to
listen
to
the
latest
story
of
how
francie
had
got
her
price
increased
they
listened
now
together
with
swithin
who
sat
pretending
not
to
for
these
young
people
talked
so
fast
and
mumbled
so
he
never
could
catch
what
they
said
and
i
ca
think
said
septimus
how
you
do
it
i
should
never
have
the
audacity
francie
smiled
lightly
i
much
rather
deal
with
a
man
than
a
woman
women
are
so
sharp
my
dear
cried
small
i
sure
we
euphemia
went
off
into
her
silent
laugh
and
ending
with
the
squeak
said
as
though
being
strangled
oh
you
kill
me
some
day
swithin
saw
no
necessity
to
laugh
he
detested
people
laughing
when
he
himself
perceived
no
joke
indeed
he
detested
euphemia
altogether
to
whom
he
always
alluded
as
daughter
what
she
pale
one
he
had
just
missed
being
her
would
have
been
had
he
not
taken
a
firm
stand
against
her
outlandish
name
he
hated
becoming
a
godfather
swithin
then
said
to
francie
with
dignity
it
a
fine
the
time
of
but
euphemia
who
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
had
refused
to
be
her
godfather
turned
to
aunt
hester
and
began
telling
her
how
she
had
seen
the
church
and
commercial
stores
and
soames
was
with
her
said
aunt
hester
to
whom
small
had
as
yet
had
no
opportunity
of
relating
the
incident
soames
with
her
of
course
not
but
was
she
all
alone
in
london
oh
no
there
was
bosinney
with
her
she
was
perfectly
but
swithin
hearing
the
name
irene
looked
severely
at
euphemia
who
it
is
true
never
did
look
well
in
a
dress
whatever
she
may
have
done
on
other
occasions
and
said
dressed
like
a
lady
i
no
doubt
it
a
pleasure
to
see
at
this
moment
james
and
his
daughters
were
announced
dartie
feeling
badly
in
want
of
a
drink
had
pleaded
an
appointment
with
his
dentist
and
being
put
down
at
the
marble
arch
had
got
into
a
hansom
and
was
already
seated
in
the
window
of
his
club
in
piccadilly
his
wife
he
told
his
cronies
had
wanted
to
take
him
to
pay
some
calls
it
was
not
in
his
exactly
haw
hailing
the
waiter
he
sent
him
out
to
the
hall
to
see
what
had
won
the
race
he
was
he
said
and
that
was
a
fact
had
been
drivin
about
with
his
wife
to
all
the
afternoon
had
put
his
foot
down
at
last
a
fellow
must
live
his
own
life
at
this
moment
glancing
out
of
the
bay
he
loved
this
seat
whence
he
could
see
everybody
eye
unfortunately
or
perhaps
fortunately
chanced
to
light
on
the
figure
of
soames
who
was
mousing
across
the
road
from
the
green
with
the
evident
intention
of
coming
in
for
he
too
belonged
to
iseeum
dartie
sprang
to
his
feet
grasping
his
glass
he
muttered
something
about
race
and
swiftly
withdrew
to
the
where
soames
never
came
here
in
complete
isolation
and
a
dim
light
he
lived
his
own
life
till
half
past
seven
by
which
hour
he
knew
soames
must
certainly
have
left
the
club
it
would
not
do
as
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
whenever
he
felt
the
impulse
to
join
the
gossips
in
the
getting
too
strong
for
absolutely
would
not
do
with
finances
as
low
as
his
and
the
man
james
rusty
ever
since
that
business
over
the
oil
shares
which
was
no
fault
of
his
to
risk
a
row
with
winifred
if
soames
were
to
see
him
in
the
club
it
would
be
sure
to
come
round
to
her
that
he
was
at
the
dentist
at
all
he
never
knew
a
family
where
things
round
so
uneasily
amongst
the
green
baize
a
frown
on
his
olive
coloured
face
his
check
trousers
crossed
and
boots
shining
through
the
gloom
he
sat
biting
his
forefinger
and
wondering
where
the
deuce
he
was
to
get
the
money
if
erotic
failed
to
win
the
lancashire
cup
his
thoughts
turned
gloomily
to
the
forsytes
what
a
set
they
were
there
was
no
getting
anything
out
of
least
it
was
a
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
they
were
so
particular
about
money
matters
not
a
sportsman
amongst
the
lot
unless
it
were
george
that
fellow
soames
for
instance
would
have
a
fit
if
you
tried
to
borrow
a
tenner
from
him
or
if
he
did
have
a
fit
he
looked
at
you
with
his
cursed
supercilious
smile
as
if
you
were
a
lost
soul
because
you
were
in
want
of
money
and
that
wife
of
his
dartie
mouth
watered
involuntarily
he
had
tried
to
be
on
good
terms
with
her
as
one
naturally
would
with
any
pretty
but
he
would
be
cursed
if
the
he
mentally
used
a
coarse
word
have
anything
to
say
to
looked
at
him
indeed
as
if
he
were
yet
she
could
go
far
enough
he
mind
betting
he
knew
women
they
were
made
with
soft
eyes
and
figures
like
that
for
nothing
as
that
fellow
soames
would
jolly
soon
find
out
if
there
were
anything
in
what
he
had
heard
about
this
buccaneer
johnny
rising
from
his
chair
dartie
took
a
turn
across
the
room
ending
in
front
of
the
over
the
marble
and
there
he
stood
for
a
long
time
contemplating
in
the
glass
the
reflection
of
his
face
it
had
that
look
peculiar
to
some
men
of
having
been
steeped
in
linseed
oil
with
its
waxed
dark
moustaches
and
the
little
distinguished
commencements
of
side
whiskers
and
concernedly
he
felt
the
promise
of
a
pimple
on
the
side
of
his
slightly
curved
and
fattish
nose
in
the
meantime
old
jolyon
had
found
the
remaining
chair
in
commodious
his
advent
had
obviously
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
decided
awkwardness
having
set
in
aunt
juley
with
her
kindheartedness
hastened
to
set
people
at
their
ease
again
yes
jolyon
she
said
we
were
just
saying
that
you
have
been
here
for
a
long
time
but
we
must
be
surprised
you
busy
of
course
james
was
just
saying
what
a
busy
time
of
year
was
he
said
old
jolyon
looking
hard
at
james
it
would
be
half
so
busy
if
everybody
minded
their
own
james
brooding
in
a
small
chair
from
which
his
knees
ran
uphill
shifted
his
feet
uneasily
and
put
one
of
them
down
on
the
cat
which
had
unwisely
taken
refuge
from
old
jolyon
beside
him
here
you
got
a
cat
here
he
said
in
an
injured
voice
withdrawing
his
foot
nervously
as
he
felt
it
squeezing
into
the
soft
furry
body
several
said
old
jolyon
looking
at
one
face
and
another
i
trod
on
one
just
a
silence
followed
then
small
twisting
her
fingers
and
gazing
round
with
calm
asked
and
how
is
dear
june
a
twinkle
of
humour
shot
through
the
sternness
of
old
jolyon
eyes
extraordinary
old
woman
juley
no
one
quite
like
her
for
saying
the
wrong
thing
bad
he
said
london
do
agree
with
many
people
about
too
much
clatter
and
chatter
by
he
laid
emphasis
on
the
words
and
again
looked
james
in
the
face
nobody
spoke
a
feeling
of
its
being
too
dangerous
to
take
a
step
in
any
direction
or
hazard
any
remark
had
fallen
on
them
all
something
of
the
sense
of
the
impending
that
comes
over
the
spectator
of
a
greek
tragedy
had
entered
that
upholstered
room
filled
with
those
old
men
and
fashionably
attired
women
who
were
all
of
the
same
blood
between
all
of
whom
existed
an
unseizable
resemblance
not
that
they
were
conscious
of
visits
of
such
fateful
bitter
spirits
are
only
felt
then
swithin
rose
he
would
not
sit
there
feeling
like
was
not
to
be
put
down
by
anyone
and
manoeuvring
round
the
room
with
added
pomp
he
shook
hands
with
each
separately
you
tell
timothy
from
me
he
said
that
he
coddles
himself
too
much
then
turning
to
francie
whom
he
considered
he
added
you
come
with
me
for
a
drive
one
of
these
but
this
conjured
up
the
vision
of
that
other
eventful
drive
which
had
been
so
much
talked
about
and
he
stood
quite
still
for
a
second
with
glassy
eyes
as
though
waiting
to
catch
up
with
the
significance
of
what
he
himself
had
said
then
suddenly
recollecting
that
he
did
care
a
damn
he
turned
to
old
jolyon
well
jolyon
you
should
go
about
without
an
overcoat
you
be
getting
sciatica
or
something
and
kicking
the
cat
slightly
with
the
pointed
tip
of
his
patent
leather
boot
he
took
his
huge
form
away
when
he
had
gone
everyone
looked
secretly
at
the
others
to
see
how
they
had
taken
the
mention
of
the
word
word
which
had
become
famous
and
acquired
an
overwhelming
importance
as
the
only
to
in
connection
with
the
vague
and
sinister
rumour
clinging
to
the
family
tongue
euphemia
yielding
to
an
impulse
said
with
a
short
laugh
i
glad
uncle
swithin
does
ask
me
to
go
for
small
to
reassure
her
and
smooth
over
any
little
awkwardness
the
subject
might
have
replied
my
dear
he
likes
to
take
somebody
well
dressed
who
will
do
him
a
little
credit
i
shall
never
forget
the
drive
he
took
me
it
was
an
experience
and
her
chubby
round
old
face
was
spread
for
a
moment
with
a
strange
contentment
then
broke
into
pouts
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
was
thinking
of
that
long
ago
driving
tour
she
had
once
taken
with
septimus
small
james
who
had
relapsed
into
his
nervous
brooding
in
the
little
chair
suddenly
roused
himself
he
a
funny
fellow
swithin
he
said
but
in
a
way
old
jolyon
silence
his
stern
eyes
held
them
all
in
a
kind
of
paralysis
he
was
disconcerted
himself
by
the
effect
of
his
own
effect
which
seemed
to
deepen
the
importance
of
the
very
rumour
he
had
come
to
scotch
but
he
was
still
angry
he
had
not
done
with
them
would
give
them
another
rub
or
two
he
did
not
wish
to
rub
his
nieces
he
had
no
quarrel
with
young
and
presentable
female
always
appealed
to
old
jolyon
that
fellow
james
and
in
a
less
degree
perhaps
those
others
deserved
all
they
would
get
and
he
too
asked
for
timothy
as
though
feeling
that
some
danger
threatened
her
younger
brother
aunt
juley
suddenly
offered
him
tea
there
it
is
she
said
all
cold
and
nasty
waiting
for
you
in
the
back
drawing
room
but
smither
shall
make
you
some
old
jolyon
rose
thank
you
he
said
looking
straight
at
james
but
i
no
time
for
tea
and
the
rest
of
it
it
time
i
was
at
home
julia
hester
without
more
ceremonious
adieux
he
marched
out
once
again
in
his
cab
his
anger
evaporated
for
so
it
ever
was
with
his
he
had
rapped
out
it
was
gone
sadness
came
over
his
spirit
he
had
stopped
their
mouths
maybe
but
at
what
a
cost
at
the
cost
of
certain
knowledge
that
the
rumour
he
had
been
resolved
not
to
believe
was
true
june
was
abandoned
and
for
the
wife
of
that
fellow
son
he
felt
it
was
true
and
hardened
himself
to
treat
it
as
if
it
were
not
but
the
pain
he
hid
beneath
this
resolution
began
slowly
surely
to
vent
itself
in
a
blind
resentment
against
james
and
his
son
the
six
women
and
one
man
left
behind
in
the
little
began
talking
as
easily
as
might
be
after
such
an
occurrence
for
though
each
one
of
them
knew
for
a
fact
that
he
or
she
never
talked
scandal
each
one
of
them
also
knew
that
the
other
six
did
all
were
therefore
angry
and
at
a
loss
james
only
was
silent
disturbed
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
presently
francie
said
do
you
know
i
think
uncle
jolyon
is
terribly
changed
this
last
year
what
do
you
think
aunt
hester
aunt
hester
made
a
little
movement
of
recoil
oh
ask
your
aunt
julia
she
said
i
know
nothing
about
no
one
else
was
afraid
of
assenting
and
james
muttered
gloomily
at
the
floor
he
not
half
the
man
he
i
noticed
it
a
long
time
went
on
francie
he
aged
aunt
juley
shook
her
head
her
face
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
one
immense
pout
poor
dear
jolyon
she
said
somebody
ought
to
see
to
it
for
him
there
was
again
silence
then
as
though
in
terror
of
being
left
solitarily
behind
all
five
visitors
rose
simultaneously
and
took
their
departure
small
aunt
hester
and
their
cat
were
left
once
more
alone
the
sound
of
a
door
closing
in
the
distance
announced
the
approach
of
timothy
that
evening
when
aunt
hester
had
just
got
off
to
sleep
in
the
back
bedroom
that
used
to
be
aunt
juley
before
aunt
juley
took
aunt
ann
her
door
was
opened
and
small
in
a
pink
a
candle
in
her
hand
entered
hester
she
said
hester
aunt
hester
faintly
rustled
the
sheet
hester
repeated
aunt
juley
to
make
quite
sure
that
she
had
awakened
her
i
am
quite
troubled
about
poor
dear
jolyon
what
aunt
juley
dwelt
on
the
word
do
you
think
ought
to
be
done
aunt
hester
again
rustled
the
sheet
her
voice
was
heard
faintly
pleading
done
how
should
i
know
aunt
juley
turned
away
satisfied
and
closing
the
door
with
extra
gentleness
so
as
not
to
disturb
dear
hester
let
it
slip
through
her
fingers
and
fall
to
with
a
back
in
her
own
room
she
stood
at
the
window
gazing
at
the
moon
over
the
trees
in
the
park
through
a
chink
in
the
muslin
curtains
close
drawn
lest
anyone
should
see
and
there
with
her
face
all
round
and
pouting
in
its
pink
cap
and
her
eyes
wet
she
thought
of
jolyon
so
old
and
so
lonely
and
how
she
could
be
of
some
use
to
him
and
how
he
would
come
to
love
her
as
she
had
never
been
loved
poor
septimus
went
away
chapter
at
roger
house
in
prince
gardens
was
brilliantly
alight
large
numbers
of
wax
candles
had
been
collected
and
placed
in
chandeliers
and
the
parquet
floor
of
the
long
double
reflected
these
constellations
an
appearance
of
real
spaciousness
had
been
secured
by
moving
out
all
the
furniture
on
to
the
upper
landings
and
enclosing
the
room
with
those
strange
appendages
of
civilization
known
as
seats
in
a
remote
corner
embowered
in
palms
was
a
cottage
piano
with
a
copy
of
the
coil
open
on
the
roger
had
objected
to
a
band
he
did
see
in
the
least
what
they
wanted
with
a
band
he
would
go
to
the
expense
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
francie
her
mother
whom
roger
had
long
since
reduced
to
chronic
dyspepsia
went
to
bed
on
such
occasions
had
been
obliged
to
content
herself
with
supplementing
the
piano
by
a
young
man
who
played
the
cornet
and
she
so
arranged
with
palms
that
anyone
who
did
not
look
into
the
heart
of
things
might
imagine
there
were
several
musicians
secreted
there
she
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
them
to
play
was
a
lot
of
music
in
a
cornet
if
the
man
would
only
put
his
soul
into
it
in
the
more
cultivated
american
tongue
she
was
at
that
tortuous
labyrinth
of
which
must
be
traversed
before
fashionable
display
can
be
combined
with
the
sound
economy
of
a
forsyte
thin
but
brilliant
in
her
frock
with
much
tulle
about
the
shoulders
she
went
from
place
to
place
fitting
on
her
gloves
and
casting
her
eye
over
it
all
to
the
hired
butler
for
roger
only
kept
maids
she
spoke
about
the
wine
did
he
quite
understand
that
forsyte
wished
a
dozen
bottles
of
the
champagne
from
whiteley
to
be
put
out
but
if
that
were
finished
she
did
not
suppose
it
would
be
most
of
the
ladies
would
drink
water
no
doubt
but
if
it
were
there
was
the
champagne
cup
and
he
must
do
the
best
he
could
with
that
she
hated
having
to
say
this
sort
of
thing
to
a
butler
it
was
so
infra
dig
but
what
could
you
do
with
father
roger
indeed
after
making
himself
consistently
disagreeable
about
the
dance
would
come
down
presently
with
his
fresh
colour
and
bumpy
forehead
as
though
he
had
been
its
promoter
and
he
would
smile
and
probably
take
the
prettiest
woman
in
to
supper
and
at
two
just
as
they
were
getting
into
the
swing
he
would
go
up
secretly
to
the
musicians
and
tell
them
to
play
save
the
queen
and
go
away
francie
devoutly
hoped
he
might
soon
get
tired
and
slip
off
to
bed
the
three
or
four
devoted
girl
friends
who
were
staying
in
the
house
for
this
dance
had
partaken
with
her
in
a
small
abandoned
room
upstairs
of
tea
and
cold
hurriedly
served
the
men
had
been
sent
out
to
dine
at
eustace
club
it
being
felt
that
they
must
be
fed
up
punctually
on
the
stroke
of
nine
arrived
small
alone
she
made
elaborate
apologies
for
the
absence
of
timothy
omitting
all
mention
of
aunt
hester
who
at
the
last
minute
had
said
she
could
not
be
bothered
francie
received
her
effusively
and
placed
her
on
a
rout
seat
where
she
left
her
pouting
and
solitary
in
first
time
she
had
worn
colour
since
aunt
ann
death
the
devoted
maiden
friends
came
now
from
their
rooms
each
by
magic
arrangement
in
a
differently
coloured
frock
but
all
with
the
same
liberal
allowance
of
tulle
on
the
shoulders
and
at
the
they
were
by
some
fatality
lean
to
a
girl
they
were
all
taken
up
to
small
none
stayed
with
her
more
than
a
few
seconds
but
clustering
together
talked
and
twisted
their
programmes
looking
secretly
at
the
door
for
the
first
appearance
of
a
man
then
arrived
in
a
group
a
number
of
nicholases
always
fashion
up
ladbroke
grove
way
and
close
behind
them
eustace
and
his
men
gloomy
and
smelling
rather
of
smoke
three
or
four
of
francie
lovers
now
appeared
one
after
the
other
she
had
made
each
promise
to
come
early
they
were
all
and
sprightly
with
that
peculiar
kind
of
sprightliness
which
had
recently
invaded
kensington
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
each
presence
in
the
least
and
wore
their
ties
bunching
out
at
the
ends
white
waistcoats
and
socks
with
clocks
all
had
handkerchiefs
concealed
in
their
cuffs
they
moved
buoyantly
each
armoured
in
professional
gaiety
as
though
he
had
come
to
do
great
deeds
their
faces
when
they
danced
far
from
wearing
the
traditional
solemn
look
of
the
dancing
englishman
were
irresponsible
charming
suave
they
bounded
twirling
their
partners
at
great
pace
without
pedantic
attention
to
the
rhythm
of
the
music
at
other
dancers
they
looked
with
a
kind
of
airy
the
light
brigade
the
heroes
of
a
hundred
kensington
whom
alone
could
the
right
manner
and
smile
and
step
be
hoped
after
this
the
stream
came
fast
chaperones
silting
up
along
the
wall
facing
the
entrance
the
volatile
element
swelling
the
eddy
in
the
larger
room
men
were
scarce
and
wallflowers
wore
their
peculiar
pathetic
expression
a
patient
sourish
smile
which
seemed
to
say
oh
no
mistake
me
i
know
you
are
not
coming
up
to
me
i
can
hardly
expect
that
and
francie
would
plead
with
one
of
her
lovers
or
with
some
callow
youth
now
to
please
me
do
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
pink
such
a
nice
girl
really
and
she
would
bring
him
up
and
say
miss
gathercole
can
you
spare
him
a
dance
then
miss
pink
smiling
her
forced
smile
colouring
a
little
answered
oh
i
think
so
and
screening
her
empty
card
wrote
on
it
the
name
of
gathercole
spelling
it
passionately
in
the
district
that
he
proposed
about
the
second
extra
but
when
the
youth
had
murmured
that
it
was
hot
and
passed
she
relapsed
into
her
attitude
of
hopeless
expectation
into
her
patient
sourish
smile
mothers
slowly
fanning
their
faces
watched
their
daughters
and
in
their
eyes
could
be
read
all
the
story
of
those
daughters
fortunes
as
for
themselves
to
sit
hour
after
hour
dead
tired
silent
or
talking
did
it
matter
so
long
as
the
girls
were
having
a
good
time
but
to
see
them
neglected
and
passed
by
ah
they
smiled
but
their
eyes
stabbed
like
the
eyes
of
an
offended
swan
they
longed
to
pluck
young
gathercole
by
the
slack
of
his
dandified
breeches
and
drag
him
to
their
jackanapes
and
all
the
cruelties
and
hardness
of
life
its
pathos
and
unequal
chances
its
conceit
and
patience
were
presented
on
the
of
this
kensington
here
and
there
too
lovers
like
francie
a
peculiar
breed
but
simply
blushing
silent
sought
each
other
by
flying
glances
sought
to
meet
and
touch
in
the
mazes
of
the
dance
and
now
and
again
dancing
together
struck
some
beholder
by
the
light
in
their
eyes
not
a
second
before
ten
came
the
rachel
winifred
dartie
had
been
left
behind
having
on
a
former
occasion
drunk
too
much
of
roger
champagne
and
cicely
the
youngest
making
her
debut
behind
them
following
in
a
hansom
from
the
paternal
mansion
where
they
had
dined
soames
and
irene
all
these
ladies
had
and
no
showing
at
once
by
a
bolder
exposure
of
flesh
that
they
came
from
the
more
fashionable
side
of
the
park
soames
sidling
back
from
the
contact
of
the
dancers
took
up
a
position
against
the
wall
guarding
himself
with
his
pale
smile
he
stood
watching
waltz
after
waltz
began
and
ended
couple
after
couple
brushed
by
with
smiling
lips
laughter
and
snatches
of
talk
or
with
set
lips
and
eyes
searching
the
throng
or
again
with
silent
parted
lips
and
eyes
on
each
other
and
the
scent
of
festivity
the
odour
of
flowers
and
hair
of
essences
that
women
love
rose
suffocatingly
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
night
silent
with
something
of
scorn
in
his
smile
soames
seemed
to
notice
nothing
but
now
and
again
his
eyes
finding
that
which
they
sought
would
fix
themselves
on
a
point
in
the
shifting
throng
and
the
smile
die
off
his
lips
he
danced
with
no
one
some
fellows
danced
with
their
wives
his
sense
of
had
never
permitted
him
to
dance
with
irene
since
their
marriage
and
the
god
of
the
forsytes
alone
can
tell
whether
this
was
a
relief
to
him
or
not
she
passed
dancing
with
other
men
her
dress
floating
away
from
her
feet
she
danced
well
he
was
tired
of
hearing
women
say
with
an
acid
smile
how
beautifully
your
wife
dances
quite
a
pleasure
to
watch
her
tired
of
answering
them
with
his
sidelong
glance
you
think
so
a
young
couple
close
by
flirted
a
fan
by
turns
making
an
unpleasant
draught
francie
and
one
of
her
lovers
stood
near
they
were
talking
of
love
he
heard
roger
voice
behind
giving
an
order
about
supper
to
a
servant
everything
was
very
he
wished
that
he
had
not
come
he
had
asked
irene
whether
she
wanted
him
she
had
answered
with
that
maddening
smile
of
hers
oh
no
why
had
he
come
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
not
even
seen
her
here
was
george
advancing
with
his
quilpish
face
it
was
too
late
to
get
out
of
his
way
have
you
seen
said
this
licensed
wag
he
on
the
cut
and
everything
soames
said
he
had
not
and
crossing
the
room
in
an
interval
of
the
dance
he
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
looked
down
into
the
street
a
carriage
had
driven
up
with
late
arrivals
and
round
the
door
hung
some
of
those
patient
watchers
of
the
london
streets
who
spring
up
to
the
call
of
light
or
music
their
faces
pale
and
upturned
above
their
black
and
rusty
figures
had
an
air
of
stolid
watching
that
annoyed
soames
why
were
they
allowed
to
hang
about
why
did
the
bobby
move
them
on
but
the
policeman
took
no
notice
of
them
his
feet
were
planted
apart
on
the
strip
of
crimson
carpet
stretched
across
the
pavement
his
face
under
the
helmet
wore
the
same
stolid
watching
look
as
theirs
across
the
road
through
the
railings
soames
could
see
the
branches
of
trees
shining
faintly
stirring
in
the
breeze
by
the
gleam
of
the
street
lamps
beyond
again
the
upper
lights
of
the
houses
on
the
other
side
so
many
eyes
looking
down
on
the
quiet
blackness
of
the
garden
and
over
all
the
sky
that
wonderful
london
sky
dusted
with
the
innumerable
reflection
of
countless
lamps
a
dome
woven
over
between
its
stars
with
the
refraction
of
human
needs
and
human
mirror
of
pomp
and
misery
that
night
after
night
stretches
its
kindly
mocking
over
miles
of
houses
and
gardens
mansions
and
squalor
over
forsytes
policemen
and
patient
watchers
in
the
streets
soames
turned
away
and
hidden
in
the
recess
gazed
into
the
lighted
room
it
was
cooler
out
there
he
saw
the
new
arrivals
june
and
her
grandfather
enter
what
had
made
them
so
late
they
stood
by
the
doorway
they
looked
fagged
fancy
uncle
jolyon
turning
out
at
this
time
of
night
why
had
june
come
to
irene
as
she
usually
did
and
it
occurred
to
him
suddenly
that
he
had
seen
nothing
of
june
for
a
long
time
now
watching
her
face
with
idle
malice
he
saw
it
change
grow
so
pale
that
he
thought
she
would
drop
then
flame
out
crimson
turning
to
see
at
what
she
was
looking
he
saw
his
wife
on
bosinney
arm
coming
from
the
conservatory
at
the
end
of
the
room
her
eyes
were
raised
to
his
as
though
answering
some
question
he
had
asked
and
he
was
gazing
at
her
intently
soames
looked
again
at
june
her
hand
rested
on
old
jolyon
arm
she
seemed
to
be
making
a
request
he
saw
a
surprised
look
on
his
face
they
turned
and
passed
through
the
door
out
of
his
sight
the
music
began
still
as
a
statue
in
the
recess
of
the
window
his
face
unmoved
but
no
smile
on
his
lips
soames
waited
presently
within
a
yard
of
the
dark
balcony
his
wife
and
bosinney
passed
he
caught
the
perfume
of
the
gardenias
that
she
wore
saw
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
the
languor
in
her
eyes
her
parted
lips
and
a
look
on
her
face
that
he
did
not
know
to
the
slow
swinging
measure
they
danced
by
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
clung
to
each
other
he
saw
her
raise
her
eyes
soft
and
dark
to
bosinney
and
drop
them
again
very
white
he
turned
back
to
the
balcony
and
leaning
on
it
gazed
down
on
the
square
the
figures
were
still
there
looking
up
at
the
light
with
dull
persistency
the
policeman
face
too
upturned
and
staring
but
he
saw
nothing
of
them
below
a
carriage
drew
up
two
figures
got
in
and
drove
away
that
evening
june
and
old
jolyon
sat
down
to
dinner
at
the
usual
hour
the
girl
was
in
her
customary
frock
old
jolyon
had
not
dressed
at
breakfast
she
had
spoken
of
the
dance
at
uncle
roger
she
wanted
to
go
she
had
been
stupid
enough
she
said
not
to
think
of
asking
anyone
to
take
her
it
was
too
late
now
old
jolyon
lifted
his
keen
eyes
june
was
used
to
go
to
dances
with
irene
as
a
matter
of
course
and
deliberately
fixing
his
gaze
on
her
he
asked
why
do
you
get
irene
no
june
did
not
want
to
ask
irene
she
would
only
go
her
grandfather
would
mind
just
for
once
for
a
little
time
at
her
look
so
eager
and
so
worn
old
jolyon
had
grumblingly
consented
he
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
he
said
with
going
to
a
dance
like
this
a
poor
affair
he
would
wager
and
she
no
more
fit
for
it
than
a
cat
what
she
wanted
was
sea
air
and
after
his
general
meeting
of
the
globular
gold
concessions
he
was
ready
to
take
her
she
did
want
to
go
away
ah
she
would
knock
herself
up
stealing
a
mournful
look
at
her
he
went
on
with
his
breakfast
june
went
out
early
and
wandered
restlessly
about
in
the
heat
her
little
light
figure
that
lately
had
moved
so
languidly
about
its
business
was
all
on
fire
she
bought
herself
some
flowers
she
meant
to
look
her
best
he
would
be
there
she
knew
well
enough
that
he
had
a
card
she
would
show
him
that
she
did
not
care
but
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
resolved
that
evening
to
win
him
back
she
came
in
flushed
and
talked
brightly
all
lunch
old
jolyon
was
there
and
he
was
deceived
in
the
afternoon
she
was
overtaken
by
a
desperate
fit
of
sobbing
she
strangled
the
noise
against
the
pillows
of
her
bed
but
when
at
last
it
ceased
she
saw
in
the
glass
a
swollen
face
with
reddened
eyes
and
violet
circles
round
them
she
stayed
in
the
darkened
room
till
dinner
time
all
through
that
silent
meal
the
struggle
went
on
within
her
she
looked
so
shadowy
and
exhausted
that
old
jolyon
told
to
countermand
the
carriage
he
would
not
have
her
going
out
she
was
to
go
to
bed
she
made
no
resistance
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
sat
in
the
dark
at
ten
she
rang
for
her
maid
bring
some
hot
water
and
go
down
and
tell
forsyte
that
i
feel
perfectly
rested
say
that
if
he
too
tired
i
can
go
to
the
dance
by
the
maid
looked
askance
and
june
turned
on
her
imperiously
go
she
said
bring
the
hot
water
at
once
her
still
lay
on
the
sofa
and
with
a
sort
of
fierce
care
she
arrayed
herself
took
the
flowers
in
her
hand
and
went
down
her
small
face
carried
high
under
its
burden
of
hair
she
could
hear
old
jolyon
in
his
room
as
she
passed
bewildered
and
vexed
he
was
dressing
it
was
past
ten
they
would
not
get
there
till
eleven
the
girl
was
mad
but
he
dared
not
cross
expression
of
her
face
at
dinner
haunted
him
with
great
ebony
brushes
he
smoothed
his
hair
till
it
shone
like
silver
under
the
light
then
he
too
came
out
on
the
gloomy
staircase
june
met
him
below
and
without
a
word
they
went
to
the
carriage
when
after
that
drive
which
seemed
to
last
for
ever
she
entered
roger
she
disguised
under
a
mask
of
resolution
a
very
torment
of
nervousness
and
emotion
the
feeling
of
shame
at
what
might
be
called
after
him
was
smothered
by
the
dread
that
he
might
not
be
there
that
she
might
not
see
him
after
all
and
by
that
dogged
she
did
not
know
win
him
back
the
sight
of
the
ballroom
with
its
gleaming
floor
gave
her
a
feeling
of
joy
of
triumph
for
she
loved
dancing
and
when
dancing
she
floated
so
light
was
she
like
a
strenuous
eager
little
spirit
he
would
surely
ask
her
to
dance
and
if
he
danced
with
her
it
would
all
be
as
it
was
before
she
looked
about
her
eagerly
the
sight
of
bosinney
coming
with
irene
from
the
conservatory
with
that
strange
look
of
utter
absorption
on
his
face
struck
her
too
suddenly
they
had
not
one
should
distress
not
even
her
grandfather
she
put
her
hand
on
jolyon
arm
and
said
very
low
i
must
go
home
gran
i
feel
he
hurried
her
away
grumbling
to
himself
that
he
had
known
how
it
would
be
to
her
he
said
nothing
only
when
they
were
once
more
in
the
carriage
which
by
some
fortunate
chance
had
lingered
near
the
door
he
asked
her
what
is
it
my
darling
feeling
her
whole
slender
body
shaken
by
sobs
he
was
terribly
alarmed
she
must
have
blank
he
would
insist
upon
it
he
could
not
have
her
like
this
there
there
june
mastered
her
sobs
and
squeezing
his
hand
feverishly
she
lay
back
in
her
corner
her
face
muffled
in
a
shawl
he
could
only
see
her
eyes
fixed
and
staring
in
the
dark
but
he
did
not
cease
to
stroke
her
hand
with
his
thin
fingers
chapter
at
richmond
other
eyes
besides
the
eyes
of
june
and
of
soames
had
seen
two
as
euphemia
had
already
begun
to
call
them
coming
from
the
conservatory
other
eyes
had
noticed
the
look
on
bosinney
face
there
are
moments
when
nature
reveals
the
passion
hidden
beneath
the
careless
calm
of
her
ordinary
spring
flashing
white
on
through
the
purple
clouds
a
snowy
moonlit
peak
with
its
single
star
soaring
up
to
the
passionate
blue
or
against
the
flames
of
sunset
an
old
standing
dark
guardian
of
some
fiery
secret
there
are
moments
too
when
in
a
a
work
noted
by
the
casual
spectator
as
fine
breaks
through
the
defences
of
some
forsyte
better
lunched
perhaps
than
his
fellows
and
holds
him
spellbound
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
there
are
things
he
are
things
here
which
are
things
something
unreasoning
unreasonable
is
upon
him
when
he
tries
to
define
it
with
the
precision
of
a
practical
man
it
eludes
him
slips
away
as
the
glow
of
the
wine
he
has
drunk
is
slipping
away
leaving
him
cross
and
conscious
of
his
liver
he
feels
that
he
has
been
extravagant
prodigal
of
something
virtue
has
gone
out
of
him
he
did
not
desire
this
glimpse
of
what
lay
under
the
three
stars
of
his
catalogue
god
forbid
that
he
should
know
anything
about
the
forces
of
nature
god
forbid
that
he
should
admit
for
a
moment
that
there
are
such
things
once
admit
that
and
where
was
he
one
paid
a
shilling
for
entrance
and
another
for
the
programme
the
look
which
june
had
seen
which
other
forsytes
had
seen
was
like
the
sudden
flashing
of
a
candle
through
a
hole
in
some
imaginary
canvas
behind
which
it
was
being
sudden
of
a
vague
erratic
glow
shadowy
and
enticing
it
brought
home
to
onlookers
the
consciousness
that
dangerous
forces
were
at
work
for
a
moment
they
noticed
it
with
pleasure
with
interest
then
felt
they
must
not
notice
it
at
all
it
supplied
however
the
reason
of
june
coming
so
late
and
disappearing
again
without
dancing
without
even
shaking
hands
with
her
lover
she
was
ill
it
was
said
and
no
wonder
but
here
they
looked
at
each
other
guiltily
they
had
no
desire
to
spread
scandal
no
desire
to
be
who
would
have
and
to
outsiders
no
word
was
breathed
unwritten
law
keeping
them
silent
then
came
the
news
that
june
had
gone
to
the
seaside
with
old
jolyon
he
had
carried
her
off
to
broadstairs
for
which
place
there
was
just
then
a
feeling
yarmouth
having
lost
caste
in
spite
of
nicholas
and
no
forsyte
going
to
the
sea
without
intending
to
have
an
air
for
his
money
such
as
would
render
him
bilious
in
a
week
that
fatally
aristocratic
tendency
of
the
first
forsyte
to
drink
madeira
had
left
his
descendants
undoubtedly
accessible
so
june
went
to
the
sea
the
family
awaited
developments
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
but
how
far
had
two
gone
how
far
were
they
going
to
go
could
they
really
be
going
at
all
nothing
could
surely
come
of
it
for
neither
of
them
had
any
money
at
the
most
a
flirtation
ending
as
all
such
attachments
should
at
the
proper
time
soames
sister
winifred
dartie
who
had
imbibed
with
the
breezes
of
lived
in
green
fashionable
principles
in
regard
to
matrimonial
behaviour
than
were
current
for
instance
in
ladbroke
grove
laughed
at
the
idea
of
there
being
anything
in
it
the
was
taller
than
herself
and
it
was
real
testimony
to
the
solid
worth
of
a
forsyte
that
she
should
always
thus
be
a
little
thing
was
bored
why
should
she
amuse
herself
soames
was
rather
tiring
and
as
to
that
buffoon
george
would
have
called
him
the
maintained
that
he
was
very
chic
this
bosinney
was
quite
a
sensation
it
failed
to
convince
that
he
was
in
a
way
they
were
prepared
to
admit
but
that
anyone
could
call
a
man
with
his
pronounced
cheekbones
curious
eyes
and
soft
felt
hats
chic
was
only
another
instance
of
winifred
extravagant
way
of
running
after
something
new
it
was
that
famous
summer
when
extravagance
was
fashionable
when
the
very
earth
was
extravagant
spread
with
blossom
and
flowers
drenched
in
perfume
as
they
had
never
been
before
when
roses
blew
in
every
garden
and
for
the
swarming
stars
the
nights
had
hardly
space
when
every
day
and
all
day
long
the
sun
in
full
armour
swung
his
brazen
shield
above
the
park
and
people
did
strange
things
lunching
and
dining
in
the
open
air
unprecedented
was
the
tale
of
cabs
and
carriages
that
streamed
across
the
bridges
of
the
shining
river
bearing
the
class
in
thousands
to
the
green
glories
of
bushey
richmond
kew
and
hampton
court
almost
every
family
with
any
pretensions
to
be
of
the
paid
one
visit
that
year
to
the
at
bushey
or
took
one
drive
amongst
the
spanish
chestnuts
of
richmond
park
bowling
smoothly
if
dustily
along
in
a
cloud
of
their
own
creation
they
would
stare
fashionably
at
the
antlered
heads
which
the
great
slow
deer
raised
out
of
a
forest
of
bracken
that
promised
to
autumn
lovers
such
cover
as
was
never
seen
before
and
now
and
again
as
the
amorous
perfume
of
chestnut
flowers
and
of
fern
was
drifted
too
near
one
would
say
to
the
other
my
dear
what
a
peculiar
scent
and
the
that
year
were
of
rare
prime
near
at
the
corners
of
london
squares
they
gave
out
as
the
sun
went
down
a
perfume
sweeter
than
the
honey
bees
had
perfume
that
stirred
a
yearning
unnamable
in
the
hearts
of
forsytes
and
their
peers
taking
the
cool
after
dinner
in
the
precincts
of
those
gardens
to
which
they
alone
had
keys
and
that
yearning
made
them
linger
amidst
the
dim
shapes
of
in
the
failing
daylight
made
them
turn
and
turn
and
turn
again
as
though
lovers
were
waiting
for
for
the
last
light
to
die
away
under
the
shadow
of
the
branches
some
vague
sympathy
evoked
by
the
scent
of
the
limes
some
sisterly
desire
to
see
for
herself
some
idea
of
demonstrating
the
soundness
of
her
dictum
that
there
was
in
it
or
merely
the
craving
to
drive
down
to
richmond
irresistible
that
summer
moved
the
mother
of
the
little
darties
of
little
publius

write
the
following
note
to

a
little
party
and
drove
down

richmond

ask
bosinney

benevolent

place

sorry

deep
flippard
it
was
late
to
send
into
the
and

to
remedy
this
misfortune
with
the
promptitude
and
conduct
of
a
mother
winifred
fell
back
on
her
husband
she
had
indeed
the
decided
but
tolerant
temperament
that
goes
with
a
good
deal
of
profile
fair
hair
and
greenish
eyes
she
was
seldom
or
never
at
a
loss
or
if
at
a
loss
was
always
able
to
convert
it
into
a
gain
dartie
too
was
in
good
feather
erotic

failed
to
win
the
lancashire
cup
indeed
that
celebrated
animal
owned
as
he
was
by
a
pillar
of
the
turf
who
had
secretly
laid
many
thousands
against
him
had
not
even
started
the
hours
that
followed
his
scratching
were
among
the
darkest
in
dartie
life
visions
of
james
haunted
him
day
and
night
black
thoughts
about
soames
mingled
with
the
faintest
hopes
on
the
friday
night
he
got
drunk
so
greatly
was
he
affected
but
on
saturday
morning
the
true
stock
exchange
instinct
triumphed
within
him
owing
some
hundreds
which
by
no
possibility
could
he
pay
he
went
into
town
and
put
them
all
on
concertina
for
the
saltown
borough
handicap
as
he
said
to
major
scrotton
with
whom
he
lunched
at
the
iseeum
that
little
jew
boy
nathans
had
given
him
the
tip
he
did
care

cursh

it
did
come
then
damme
the
old
man
would
have
to
pay
a
bottle
of
pol
roger
to
his
own
cheek
had
given
him
a
new
contempt
for
james
it
came
up
concertina
was
squeezed
home
by
her
terrible
squeak
but
as
dartie
said
there
was
nothing
like
pluck
he
was
by
no
means
averse
to
the
expedition
to
richmond
he
would
it
himself
he
cherished
an
admiration
for
irene
and
wished
to
be
on
more
playful
terms
with
her
at
five
the
park
lane
footman
came
round
to
say
forsyte
was
very
sorry
but
one
of
the
horses
was
coughing
undaunted
by
this
further
blow
winifred
at
once
despatched
little
publius
now
aged
seven
with
the
nursery
governess
to
montpellier
square
they
would
go
down
in
hansoms
and
meet
at
the
crown
and
sceptre
at
dartie
on
being
told
was
pleased
enough
it
was
better
than
going
down
with
your
back
to
the
horses
he
had
no
objection
to
driving
down
with
irene
he
supposed
they
would
pick
up
the
others
at
montpellier
square
and
swop
hansoms
there
informed
that
the
meet
was
at
the
crown
and
sceptre
and
that
he
would
have
to
drive
with
his
wife
he
turned
sulky
and
said
it
was
slow
at
seven
they
started
dartie
offering
to
bet
the
driver
he
did
do
it
in
the
of
an
hour
twice
only
did
husband
and
wife
exchange
remarks
on
the
way
dartie
said
it
put
master
soames
nose
out
of
joint
to
hear
his
wife
been
drivin
in
a
hansom
with
master
bosinney
winifred
replied
do
talk
such
nonsense
monty
nonsense
repeated
dartie
you
do
know
women
my
fine
lady
on
the
other
occasion
he
merely
asked
how
am
i
looking
a
bit
puffy
about
the
gills
that
fizz
old
george
is
so
fond
of
is
a
windy
wine
he
had
been
lunching
with
george
forsyte
at
the
haversnake
bosinney
and
irene
had
arrived
before
them
they
were
standing
in
one
of
the
long
french
windows
overlooking
the
river
windows
that
summer
were
open
all
day
long
and
all
night
too
and
day
and
night
the
scents
of
flowers
and
trees
came
in
the
hot
scent
of
parching
grass
and
the
cool
scent
of
the
heavy
dews
to
the
eye
of
the
observant
dartie
his
two
guests
did
not
appear
to
be
making
much
running
standing
there
close
together
without
a
word
bosinney
was
a
much
go
about
him
he
left
them
to
winifred
however
and
busied
himself
to
order
the
dinner
a
forsyte
will
require
good
if
not
delicate
feeding
but
a
dartie
will
tax
the
resources
of
a
crown
and
sceptre
living
as
he
does
from
hand
to
mouth
nothing
is
too
good
for
him
to
eat
and
he
will
eat
it
his
drink
too
will
need
to
be
carefully
provided
there
is
much
drink
in
this
country
good
enough
for
a
dartie
he
will
have
the
best
paying
for
things
vicariously
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
stint
himself
to
stint
yourself
is
the
mark
of
a
fool
not
of
a
dartie
the
best
of
everything
no
sounder
principle
on
which
a
man
can
base
his
life
whose
has
a
very
considerable
income
and
a
partiality
for
his
grandchildren
with
his
not
unable
eye
dartie
had
spotted
this
weakness
in
james
the
very
first
year
after
little
publius
arrival
an
error
he
had
profited
by
his
perspicacity
four
little
darties
were
now
a
sort
of
perpetual
insurance
the
feature
of
the
feast
was
unquestionably
the
red
mullet
this
delectable
fish
brought
from
a
considerable
distance
in
a
state
of
almost
perfect
preservation
was
first
fried
then
boned
then
served
in
ice
with
madeira
punch
in
place
of
sauce
according
to
a
recipe
known
to
a
few
men
of
the
world
nothing
else
calls
for
remark
except
the
payment
of
the
bill
by
dartie
he
had
made
himself
extremely
agreeable
throughout
the
meal
his
bold
admiring
stare
seldom
abandoning
irene
face
and
figure
as
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
he
got
no
change
out
of
was
cool
enough
as
cool
as
her
shoulders
looked
under
their
veil
of
creamy
lace
he
expected
to
have
caught
her
out
in
some
little
game
with
bosinney
but
not
a
bit
of
it
she
kept
up
her
end
remarkably
well
as
for
that
architect
chap
he
was
as
glum
as
a
bear
with
a
sore
could
barely
get
a
word
out
of
him
he
ate
nothing
but
he
certainly
took
his
liquor
and
his
face
kept
getting
whiter
and
his
eyes
looked
queer
it
was
all
very
amusing
for
dartie
himself
was
in
capital
form
and
talked
freely
with
a
certain
poignancy
being
no
fool
he
told
two
or
three
stories
verging
on
the
improper
a
concession
to
the
company
for
his
stories
were
not
used
to
verging
he
proposed
irene
health
in
a
mock
speech
nobody
drank
it
and
winifred
said
do
be
such
a
clown
monty
at
her
suggestion
they
went
after
dinner
to
the
public
terrace
overlooking
the
river
i
should
like
to
see
the
common
people
making
love
she
said
such
fun
there
were
numbers
of
them
walking
in
the
cool
after
the
day
heat
and
the
air
was
alive
with
the
sound
of
voices
coarse
and
loud
or
soft
as
though
murmuring
secrets
it
was
not
long
before
winifred
better
was
the
only
forsyte
them
an
empty
bench
they
sat
down
in
a
row
a
heavy
tree
spread
a
thick
canopy
above
their
heads
and
the
haze
darkened
slowly
over
the
river
dartie
sat
at
the
end
next
to
him
irene
then
bosinney
then
winifred
there
was
hardly
room
for
four
and
the
man
of
the
world
could
feel
irene
arm
crushed
against
his
own
he
knew
that
she
could
not
withdraw
it
without
seeming
rude
and
this
amused
him
he
devised
every
now
and
again
a
movement
that
would
bring
her
closer
still
he
thought
buccaneer
johnny
sha
have
it
all
to
himself
it
a
pretty
tight
fit
certainly
from
far
down
below
on
the
dark
river
came
drifting
the
tinkle
of
a
mandoline
and
voices
singing
the
old
round
boat
a
boat
unto
the
ferry
for
we
go
over
and
be
merry
and
laugh
and
quaff
and
drink
brown
sherry
and
suddenly
the
moon
appeared
young
and
tender
floating
up
on
her
back
from
behind
a
tree
and
as
though
she
had
breathed
the
air
was
cooler
but
down
that
cooler
air
came
always
the
warm
odour
of
the
limes
over
his
cigar
dartie
peered
round
at
bosinney
who
was
sitting
with
his
arms
crossed
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
and
on
his
face
the
look
of
a
man
being
tortured
and
dartie
shot
a
glance
at
the
face
between
so
veiled
by
the
overhanging
shadow
that
it
was
but
like
a
darker
piece
of
the
darkness
shaped
and
breathed
on
soft
mysterious
enticing
a
hush
had
fallen
on
the
noisy
terrace
as
if
all
the
strollers
were
thinking
secrets
too
precious
to
be
spoken
and
dartie
thought
the
glow
died
above
the
river
the
singing
ceased
the
young
moon
hid
behind
a
tree
and
all
was
dark
he
pressed
himself
against
irene
he
was
not
alarmed
at
the
shuddering
that
ran
through
the
limbs
he
touched
or
at
the
troubled
scornful
look
of
her
eyes
he
felt
her
trying
to
draw
herself
away
and
smiled
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
man
of
the
world
had
drunk
quite
as
much
as
was
good
for
him
with
thick
lips
parted
under
his
moustaches
and
his
bold
eyes
aslant
upon
her
he
had
the
malicious
look
of
a
satyr
along
the
pathway
of
sky
between
the
hedges
of
the
tree
tops
the
stars
clustered
forth
like
mortals
beneath
they
seemed
to
shift
and
swarm
and
whisper
then
on
the
terrace
the
buzz
broke
out
once
more
and
dartie
thought
he
a
poor
devil
that
bosinney
and
again
he
pressed
himself
against
irene
the
movement
deserved
a
better
success
she
rose
and
they
all
followed
her
the
man
of
the
world
was
more
than
ever
determined
to
see
what
she
was
made
of
along
the
terrace
he
kept
close
at
her
elbow
he
had
within
him
much
good
wine
there
was
the
long
drive
home
the
long
drive
and
the
warm
dark
and
the
pleasant
closeness
of
the
hansom
its
insulation
from
the
world
devised
by
some
great
and
good
man
that
hungry
architect
chap
might
drive
with
his
wished
him
joy
of
her
and
conscious
that
his
voice
was
not
too
steady
he
was
careful
not
to
speak
but
a
smile
had
become
fixed
on
his
thick
lips
they
strolled
along
toward
the
cabs
awaiting
them
at
the
farther
end
his
plan
had
the
merit
of
all
great
plans
an
almost
brutal
he
would
merely
keep
at
her
elbow
till
she
got
in
and
get
in
quickly
after
her
but
when
irene
reached
the
cab
she
did
not
get
in
she
slipped
instead
to
the
horse
head
dartie
was
not
at
the
moment
sufficiently
master
of
his
legs
to
follow
she
stood
stroking
the
horse
nose
and
to
his
annoyance
bosinney
was
at
her
side
first
she
turned
and
spoke
to
him
rapidly
in
a
low
voice
the
words
man
reached
dartie
he
stood
stubbornly
by
the
cab
step
waiting
for
her
to
come
back
he
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
here
in
the
his
figure
no
more
than
medium
height
well
squared
in
its
white
evening
waistcoat
his
light
overcoat
flung
over
his
arm
a
pink
flower
in
his
and
on
his
dark
face
that
look
of
confident
insolence
he
was
at
his
thorough
man
of
the
world
winifred
was
already
in
her
cab
dartie
reflected
that
bosinney
would
have
a
poorish
time
in
that
cab
if
he
did
look
sharp
suddenly
he
received
a
push
which
nearly
overturned
him
in
the
road
voice
hissed
in
his
ear
i
am
taking
irene
back
do
you
understand
he
saw
a
face
white
with
passion
and
eyes
that
glared
at
him
like
a
wild
cat
eh
he
stammered
what
not
a
bit
you
take
my
wife
get
away
hissed
or
i
throw
you
into
the
road
dartie
recoiled
he
saw
as
plainly
as
possible
that
the
fellow
meant
it
in
the
space
he
made
irene
had
slipped
by
her
dress
brushed
his
legs
bosinney
stepped
in
after
her
go
on
he
heard
the
buccaneer
cry
the
cabman
flicked
his
horse
it
sprang
forward
dartie
stood
for
a
moment
dumbfounded
then
dashing
at
the
cab
where
his
wife
sat
he
scrambled
in
drive
on
he
shouted
to
the
driver
and
do
you
lose
sight
of
that
fellow
in
front
seated
by
his
wife
side
he
burst
into
imprecations
calming
himself
at
last
with
a
supreme
effort
he
added
a
pretty
mess
you
made
of
it
to
let
the
buccaneer
drive
home
with
her
why
on
earth
could
you
keep
hold
of
him
he
mad
with
love
any
fool
can
see
that
he
drowned
winifred
rejoinder
with
fresh
calls
to
the
almighty
nor
was
it
until
they
reached
barnes
that
he
ceased
a
jeremiad
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
abused
her
her
father
her
brother
irene
bosinney
the
name
of
forsyte
his
own
children
and
cursed
the
day
when
he
had
ever
married
winifred
a
woman
of
strong
character
let
him
have
his
say
at
the
end
of
which
he
lapsed
into
sulky
silence
his
angry
eyes
never
deserted
the
back
of
that
cab
which
like
a
lost
chance
haunted
the
darkness
in
front
of
him
fortunately
he
could
not
hear
bosinney
passionate
pleading
which
the
man
of
the
world
conduct
had
let
loose
like
a
flood
he
could
not
see
irene
shivering
as
though
some
garment
had
been
torn
from
her
nor
her
eyes
black
and
mournful
like
the
eyes
of
a
beaten
child
he
could
not
hear
bosinney
entreating
entreating
always
entreating
could
not
hear
her
sudden
soft
weeping
nor
see
that
poor
devil
awed
and
trembling
humbly
touching
her
hand
in
montpellier
square
their
cabman
following
his
instructions
to
the
letter
faithfully
drew
up
behind
the
cab
in
front
the
darties
saw
bosinney
spring
out
and
irene
follow
and
hasten
up
the
steps
with
bent
head
she
evidently
had
her
key
in
her
hand
for
she
disappeared
at
once
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
she
had
turned
to
speak
to
bosinney
the
latter
came
walking
past
their
cab
both
husband
and
wife
had
an
admirable
view
of
his
face
in
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
it
was
working
with
violent
emotion
bosinney
called
winifred
bosinney
started
clawed
off
his
hat
and
hurried
on
he
had
obviously
forgotten
their
existence
there
said
dartie
did
you
see
the
beast
face
what
did
i
say
fine
games
he
improved
the
occasion
there
had
so
clearly
been
a
crisis
in
the
cab
that
winifred
was
unable
to
defend
her
theory
she
said
i
shall
say
nothing
about
it
i
do
see
any
use
in
making
a
fuss
with
that
view
dartie
at
once
concurred
looking
upon
james
as
a
private
preserve
he
disapproved
of
his
being
disturbed
by
the
troubles
of
others
quite
right
he
said
let
soames
look
after
himself
he
jolly
well
able
to
thus
speaking
the
darties
entered
their
habitat
in
green
street
the
rent
of
which
was
paid
by
james
and
sought
a
rest
the
hour
was
midnight
and
no
forsytes
remained
abroad
in
the
streets
to
spy
out
bosinney
wanderings
to
see
him
return
and
stand
against
the
rails
of
the
square
garden
back
from
the
glow
of
the
street
lamp
to
see
him
stand
there
in
the
shadow
of
trees
watching
the
house
where
in
the
dark
was
hidden
she
whom
he
would
have
given
the
world
to
see
for
a
single
who
was
now
to
him
the
breath
of
the
the
meaning
of
the
light
and
the
darkness
the
very
beating
of
his
own
heart
chapter
of
a
forsyte
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
forsyte
to
be
ignorant
that
he
is
a
forsyte
but
young
jolyon
was
well
aware
of
being
one
he
had
not
known
it
till
after
the
decisive
step
which
had
made
him
an
outcast
since
then
the
knowledge
had
been
with
him
continually
he
felt
it
throughout
his
alliance
throughout
all
his
dealings
with
his
second
wife
who
was
emphatically
not
a
forsyte
he
knew
that
if
he
had
not
possessed
in
great
measure
the
eye
for
what
he
wanted
the
tenacity
to
hold
on
to
it
the
sense
of
the
folly
of
wasting
that
for
which
he
had
given
so
big
a
other
words
the
of
property
he
could
never
have
retained
her
perhaps
never
would
have
desired
to
retain
her
with
him
through
all
the
financial
troubles
slights
and
misconstructions
of
those
fifteen
years
never
have
induced
her
to
marry
him
on
the
death
of
his
first
wife
never
have
lived
it
all
through
and
come
up
as
it
were
thin
but
smiling
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
seated
like
miniature
chinese
idols
in
the
cages
of
their
own
hearts
are
ever
smiling
at
themselves
a
doubting
smile
not
that
this
smile
so
intimate
and
eternal
interfered
with
his
actions
which
like
his
chin
and
his
temperament
were
quite
a
peculiar
blend
of
softness
and
determination
he
was
conscious
too
of
being
a
forsyte
in
his
work
that
painting
of
to
which
he
devoted
so
much
energy
always
with
an
eye
on
himself
as
though
he
could
not
take
so
unpractical
a
pursuit
quite
seriously
and
always
with
a
certain
queer
uneasiness
that
he
did
not
make
more
money
at
it
it
was
then
this
consciousness
of
what
it
meant
to
be
a
forsyte
that
made
him
receive
the
following
letter
from
old
jolyon
with
a
mixture
of
sympathy
and
disgust
house
dear
jo
the
dad
handwriting
had
altered
very
little
in
the
thirty
odd
years
that
he
remembered
it
have
been
here
now
a
fortnight
and
have
had
good
weather
on
the
whole
the
air
is
bracing
but
my
liver
is
out
of
order
and
i
shall
be
glad
enough
to
get
back
to
town
i
can
not
say
much
for
june
her
health
and
spirits
are
very
indifferent
and
i
do
see
what
is
to
come
of
it
she
says
nothing
but
it
is
clear
that
she
is
harping
on
this
engagement
which
is
an
engagement
and
no
engagement
knows
what
i
have
grave
doubts
whether
she
ought
to
be
allowed
to
return
to
london
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
but
she
is
so
that
she
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
come
up
at
any
moment
the
fact
is
someone
ought
to
speak
to
bosinney
and
ascertain
what
he
means
afraid
of
this
myself
for
i
should
certainly
rap
him
over
the
knuckles
but
i
thought
that
you
knowing
him
at
the
club
might
put
in
a
word
and
get
to
ascertain
what
the
fellow
is
about
you
will
of
course
in
no
way
commit
june
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
whether
you
have
succeeded
in
gaining
any
information
the
situation
is
very
distressing
to
me
i
worry
about
it
at
night
with
my
love
to
jolly
and
holly
am
affect
father
forsyte
young
jolyon
pondered
this
letter
so
long
and
seriously
that
his
wife
noticed
his
preoccupation
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
he
replied
it
was
a
fixed
principle
with
him
never
to
allude
to
june
she
might
take
alarm
he
did
not
know
what
she
might
think
he
hastened
therefore
to
banish
from
his
manner
all
traces
of
absorption
but
in
this
he
was
about
as
successful
as
his
father
would
have
been
for
he
had
inherited
all
old
jolyon
transparency
in
matters
of
domestic
finesse
and
young
jolyon
busying
herself
over
the
affairs
of
the
house
went
about
with
tightened
lips
stealing
at
him
unfathomable
looks
he
started
for
the
club
in
the
afternoon
with
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
without
having
made
up
his
mind
to
sound
a
man
as
to
intentions
was
peculiarly
unpleasant
to
him
nor
did
his
own
anomalous
position
diminish
this
unpleasantness
it
was
so
like
his
family
so
like
all
the
people
they
knew
and
mixed
with
to
enforce
what
they
called
their
rights
over
a
man
to
bring
him
up
to
the
mark
so
like
them
to
carry
their
business
principles
into
their
private
relations
and
how
that
phrase
in
the
will
of
course
in
no
way
commit
the
whole
thing
away
yet
the
letter
with
the
personal
grievance
the
concern
for
june
the
over
the
knuckles
was
all
so
natural
no
wonder
his
father
wanted
to
know
what
bosinney
meant
no
wonder
he
was
angry
it
was
difficult
to
refuse
but
why
give
the
thing
to
him
to
do
that
was
surely
quite
unbecoming
but
so
long
as
a
forsyte
got
what
he
was
after
he
was
not
too
particular
about
the
means
provided
appearances
were
saved
how
should
he
set
about
it
or
how
refuse
both
seemed
impossible
so
young
jolyon
he
arrived
at
the
club
at
three
and
the
first
person
he
saw
was
bosinney
himself
seated
in
a
corner
staring
out
of
the
window
young
jolyon
sat
down
not
far
off
and
began
nervously
to
reconsider
his
position
he
looked
covertly
at
bosinney
sitting
there
unconscious
he
did
not
know
him
very
well
and
studied
him
attentively
for
perhaps
the
first
time
an
unusual
looking
man
unlike
in
dress
face
and
manner
to
most
of
the
other
members
of
the
jolyon
himself
however
different
he
had
become
in
mood
and
temper
had
always
retained
the
neat
reticence
of
forsyte
appearance
he
alone
among
forsytes
was
ignorant
of
bosinney
nickname
the
man
was
unusual
not
eccentric
but
unusual
he
looked
worn
too
haggard
hollow
in
the
cheeks
beneath
those
broad
high
cheekbones
though
without
any
appearance
of
for
he
was
strongly
built
with
curly
hair
that
seemed
to
show
all
the
vitality
of
a
fine
constitution
something
in
his
face
and
attitude
touched
young
jolyon
he
knew
what
suffering
was
like
and
this
man
looked
as
if
he
were
suffering
he
got
up
and
touched
his
arm
bosinney
started
but
exhibited
no
sign
of
embarrassment
on
seeing
who
it
was
young
jolyon
sat
down
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
he
said
how
are
you
getting
on
with
my
cousin
house
it
be
finished
in
about
a
i
congratulate
you
do
know
that
it
much
of
a
subject
for
no
queried
young
jolyon
i
should
have
thought
you
be
glad
to
get
a
long
job
like
that
off
your
hands
but
i
suppose
you
feel
it
much
as
i
do
when
i
part
with
a
sort
of
child
he
looked
kindly
at
bosinney
yes
said
the
latter
more
cordially
it
goes
out
from
you
and
an
end
of
it
i
did
know
you
only
i
ca
say
i
believe
in
my
do
believe
in
it
can
you
do
it
work
no
use
unless
you
believe
in
it
good
said
young
jolyon
it
exactly
what
i
always
said
have
you
noticed
that
whenever
one
says
one
always
adds
exactly
what
i
always
said
but
if
you
ask
me
how
i
do
it
i
answer
because
i
a
a
forsyte
i
never
thought
of
you
as
one
a
forsyte
replied
young
jolyon
is
not
an
uncommon
animal
there
are
hundreds
among
the
members
of
this
club
hundreds
out
there
in
the
streets
you
meet
them
wherever
you
go
and
how
do
you
tell
them
may
i
ask
said
bosinney
by
their
sense
of
property
a
forsyte
takes
a
might
say
a
of
things
and
a
practical
view
of
things
is
based
fundamentally
on
a
sense
of
property
a
forsyte
you
will
notice
never
gives
himself
joking
young
jolyon
eye
twinkled
not
much
as
a
forsyte
myself
i
have
no
business
to
talk
but
i
a
kind
of
thoroughbred
mongrel
now
there
no
mistaking
you
as
different
from
me
as
i
am
from
my
uncle
james
who
is
the
perfect
specimen
of
a
forsyte
his
sense
of
property
is
extreme
while
you
have
practically
none
without
me
in
between
you
would
seem
like
a
different
species
i
the
missing
link
we
are
of
course
all
of
us
the
slaves
of
property
and
i
admit
that
it
a
question
of
degree
but
what
i
call
a
is
a
man
who
is
decidedly
more
than
less
a
slave
of
property
he
knows
a
good
thing
he
knows
a
safe
thing
and
his
grip
on
does
matter
whether
it
be
wives
houses
money
or
his
ah
murmured
bosinney
you
should
patent
the
i
should
like
said
young
jolyon
to
lecture
on
it
properties
and
quality
of
a
forsyte
this
little
animal
disturbed
by
the
ridicule
of
his
own
sort
is
unaffected
in
his
motions
by
the
laughter
of
strange
creatures
you
or
i
hereditarily
disposed
to
myopia
he
recognises
only
the
persons
of
his
own
species
amongst
which
he
passes
an
existence
of
competitive
you
talk
of
them
said
bosinney
as
if
they
were
half
they
are
repeated
young
jolyon
half
england
and
the
better
half
too
the
safe
half
the
three
per
cent
half
the
half
that
counts
their
wealth
and
security
that
makes
everything
possible
makes
your
art
possible
makes
literature
science
even
religion
possible
without
forsytes
who
believe
in
none
of
these
things
and
habitats
but
turn
them
all
to
use
where
should
we
be
my
dear
sir
the
forsytes
are
the
middlemen
the
commercials
the
pillars
of
society
the
cornerstones
of
convention
everything
that
is
admirable
i
do
know
whether
i
catch
your
drift
said
bosinney
but
i
fancy
there
are
plenty
of
forsytes
as
you
call
them
in
my
certainly
replied
young
jolyon
the
great
majority
of
architects
painters
or
writers
have
no
principles
like
any
other
forsytes
art
literature
religion
survive
by
virtue
of
the
few
cranks
who
really
believe
in
such
things
and
the
many
forsytes
who
make
a
commercial
use
of
them
at
a
low
estimate
of
our
royal
academicians
are
forsytes
of
our
novelists
a
large
proportion
of
the
press
of
science
i
ca
speak
they
are
magnificently
represented
in
religion
in
the
house
of
commons
perhaps
more
numerous
than
anywhere
the
aristocracy
speaks
for
itself
but
i
not
laughing
it
is
dangerous
to
go
against
the
majority
and
what
a
majority
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
bosinney
it
dangerous
to
let
anything
carry
you
house
a
picture
they
looked
at
each
as
though
he
had
done
that
which
no
forsyte
himself
away
young
jolyon
drew
into
his
shell
bosinney
broke
the
silence
why
do
you
take
your
own
people
as
the
type
said
he
my
people
replied
young
jolyon
are
not
very
extreme
and
they
have
their
own
private
peculiarities
like
every
other
family
but
they
possess
in
a
remarkable
degree
those
two
qualities
which
are
the
real
tests
of
a
power
of
never
being
able
to
give
yourself
up
to
anything
soul
and
body
and
the
of
bosinney
smiled
how
about
the
big
one
for
instance
do
you
mean
swithin
asked
young
jolyon
ah
in
swithin
something
primeval
still
the
town
and
life
digested
him
yet
all
the
old
centuries
of
farm
work
and
brute
force
have
settled
in
him
and
there
they
stuck
for
all
he
so
bosinney
seemed
to
ponder
well
you
hit
your
cousin
soames
off
to
the
life
he
said
suddenly
he
never
blow
his
brains
young
jolyon
shot
at
him
a
penetrating
glance
no
he
said
he
wo
that
why
he
to
be
reckoned
with
look
out
for
their
grip
it
easy
to
laugh
but
do
mistake
me
it
does
do
to
despise
a
forsyte
it
does
do
to
disregard
them
yet
you
done
it
yourself
young
jolyon
acknowledged
the
hit
by
losing
his
smile
you
forget
he
said
with
a
queer
pride
i
can
hold
on
a
forsyte
myself
we
all
in
the
path
of
great
forces
the
man
who
leaves
the
shelter
of
the
know
what
i
mean
i
do
he
ended
very
low
as
though
uttering
a
threat
recommend
every
man
it
the
colour
rushed
into
bosinney
face
but
soon
receded
leaving
it
as
before
he
gave
a
short
laugh
that
left
his
lips
fixed
in
a
queer
fierce
smile
his
eyes
mocked
young
jolyon
thanks
he
said
it
deuced
kind
of
you
but
you
not
the
only
chaps
that
can
hold
he
rose
young
jolyon
looked
after
him
as
he
walked
away
and
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
sighed
in
the
drowsy
almost
empty
room
the
only
sounds
were
the
rustle
of
newspapers
the
scraping
of
matches
being
struck
he
stayed
a
long
time
without
moving
living
over
again
those
days
when
he
too
had
sat
long
hours
watching
the
clock
waiting
for
the
minutes
to
hours
full
of
the
torments
of
uncertainty
and
of
a
fierce
sweet
aching
and
the
slow
delicious
agony
of
that
season
came
back
to
him
with
its
old
poignancy
the
sight
of
bosinney
with
his
haggard
face
and
his
restless
eyes
always
wandering
to
the
clock
had
roused
in
him
a
pity
with
which
was
mingled
strange
irresistible
envy
he
knew
the
signs
so
well
whither
was
he
what
sort
of
fate
what
kind
of
woman
was
it
who
was
drawing
him
to
her
by
that
magnetic
force
which
no
consideration
of
honour
no
principle
no
interest
could
withstand
from
which
the
only
escape
was
flight
flight
but
why
should
bosinney
fly
a
man
fled
when
he
was
in
danger
of
destroying
hearth
and
home
when
there
were
children
when
he
felt
himself
trampling
down
ideals
breaking
something
but
here
so
he
had
heard
it
was
all
broken
to
his
hand
he
himself
had
not
fled
nor
would
he
fly
if
it
were
all
to
come
over
again
yet
he
had
gone
further
than
bosinney
had
broken
up
his
own
unhappy
home
not
someone
else
and
the
old
saying
came
back
to
him
man
fate
lies
in
his
own
heart
in
his
own
heart
the
proof
of
the
pudding
was
in
the
had
still
to
eat
his
pudding
his
thoughts
passed
to
the
woman
the
woman
whom
he
did
not
know
but
the
outline
of
whose
story
he
had
heard
an
unhappy
marriage
no
that
indefinable
malaise
that
terrible
blight
which
killed
all
sweetness
under
heaven
and
so
from
day
to
day
from
night
to
night
from
week
to
week
from
year
to
year
till
death
should
end
it
but
young
jolyon
the
bitterness
of
whose
own
feelings
time
had
assuaged
saw
soames
side
of
the
question
too
whence
should
a
man
like
his
cousin
saturated
with
all
the
prejudices
and
beliefs
of
his
class
draw
the
insight
or
inspiration
necessary
to
break
up
this
life
it
was
a
question
of
imagination
of
projecting
himself
into
the
future
beyond
the
unpleasant
gossip
sneers
and
tattle
that
followed
on
such
separations
beyond
the
passing
pangs
that
the
lack
of
the
sight
of
her
would
cause
beyond
the
grave
disapproval
of
the
worthy
but
few
men
and
especially
few
men
of
soames
class
had
imagination
enough
for
that
a
deal
of
mortals
in
this
world
and
not
enough
imagination
to
go
round
and
sweet
heaven
what
a
difference
between
theory
and
practice
many
a
man
perhaps
even
soames
held
chivalrous
views
on
such
matters
who
when
the
shoe
pinched
found
a
distinguishing
factor
that
made
of
himself
an
exception
then
too
he
distrusted
his
judgment
he
had
been
through
the
experience
himself
had
tasted
too
the
dregs
the
bitterness
of
an
unhappy
marriage
and
how
could
he
take
the
wide
and
dispassionate
view
of
those
who
had
never
been
within
sound
of
the
battle
his
evidence
was
too
the
evidence
on
military
matters
of
a
soldier
who
has
been
through
much
active
service
against
that
of
civilians
who
have
not
suffered
the
disadvantage
of
seeing
things
too
close
most
people
would
consider
such
a
marriage
as
that
of
soames
and
irene
quite
fairly
successful
he
had
money
she
had
beauty
it
was
a
case
for
compromise
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
not
jog
along
even
if
they
hated
each
other
it
would
not
matter
if
they
went
their
own
ways
a
little
so
long
as
the
decencies
were
sanctity
of
the
marriage
tie
of
the
common
home
respected
half
the
marriages
of
the
upper
classes
were
conducted
on
these
lines
do
not
offend
the
susceptibilities
of
society
do
not
offend
the
susceptibilities
of
the
church
to
avoid
offending
these
is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
any
private
feelings
the
advantages
of
the
stable
home
are
visible
tangible
so
many
pieces
of
property
there
is
no
risk
in
the
statu
quo
to
break
up
a
home
is
at
the
best
a
dangerous
experiment
and
selfish
into
the
bargain
this
was
the
case
for
the
defence
and
young
jolyon
sighed
core
of
it
all
he
thought
property
but
there
are
many
people
who
would
not
like
it
put
that
way
to
them
it
is
the
sanctity
of
the
marriage
tie
but
the
sanctity
of
the
marriage
tie
is
dependent
on
the
sanctity
of
the
family
and
the
sanctity
of
the
family
is
dependent
on
the
sanctity
of
property
and
yet
i
imagine
all
these
people
are
followers
of
one
who
never
owned
anything
it
is
curious
and
again
young
jolyon
sighed
i
going
on
my
way
home
to
ask
any
poor
devils
i
meet
to
share
my
dinner
which
will
then
be
too
little
for
myself
or
at
all
events
for
my
wife
who
is
necessary
to
my
health
and
happiness
it
may
be
that
after
all
soames
does
well
to
exercise
his
rights
and
support
by
his
practice
the
sacred
principle
of
property
which
benefits
us
all
with
the
exception
of
those
who
suffer
by
the
process
and
so
he
left
his
chair
threaded
his
way
through
the
maze
of
seats
took
his
hat
and
languidly
up
the
hot
streets
crowded
with
carriages
reeking
with
dusty
odours
wended
his
way
home
before
reaching
wistaria
avenue
he
removed
old
jolyon
letter
from
his
pocket
and
tearing
it
carefully
into
tiny
pieces
scattered
them
in
the
dust
of
the
road
he
let
himself
in
with
his
key
and
called
his
wife
name
but
she
had
gone
out
taking
jolly
and
holly
and
the
house
was
empty
alone
in
the
garden
the
dog
balthasar
lay
in
the
shade
snapping
at
flies
young
jolyon
took
his
seat
there
too
under
the
that
bore
no
fruit
chapter
on
parole
the
day
after
the
evening
at
richmond
soames
returned
from
henley
by
a
morning
train
not
constitutionally
interested
in
amphibious
sports
his
visit
had
been
one
of
business
rather
than
pleasure
a
client
of
some
importance
having
asked
him
down
he
went
straight
to
the
city
but
finding
things
slack
he
left
at
three
glad
of
this
chance
to
get
home
quietly
irene
did
not
expect
him
not
that
he
had
any
desire
to
spy
on
her
actions
but
there
was
no
harm
in
thus
unexpectedly
surveying
the
scene
after
changing
to
park
clothes
he
went
into
the
she
was
sitting
idly
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
her
favourite
seat
and
there
were
circles
under
her
eyes
as
though
she
had
not
slept
he
asked
how
is
it
you
in
are
you
expecting
somebody
yes
that
is
not
who
mr
bosinney
said
he
might
bosinney
he
ought
to
be
at
to
this
she
made
no
answer
well
said
soames

you
to
come
out
to
the
stores
with
me
and
after
that
we

to
go

a
soames
replied

i
want
you

do
anything

always
got
a
headache
it
do
you
good
to
come
and
sit
under
the
she
did
not
answer
soames
was
silent
for
some
minutes
at
last
he
said
i
do
know
what
your
idea
of
a
wife
duty
is
i
never
have
known
he
had
not
expected
her
to
reply
but
she
did
i
have
tried
to
do
what
you
want
it
not
my
fault
that
i
have
been
able
to
put
my
heart
into
whose
fault
is
it
then
he
watched
her
askance
before
we
were
married
you
promised
to
let
me
go
if
our
marriage
was
not
a
success
is
it
a
success
soames
frowned
success
he
it
would
be
a
success
if
you
behaved
yourself
properly
i
have
tried
said
irene
will
you
let
me
go
soames
turned
away
secretly
alarmed
he
took
refuge
in
bluster
let
you
go
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
let
you
go
how
can
i
let
you
go
we
married
are
we
then
what
are
you
talking
about
for
god
sake
do
let
have
any
of
this
sort
of
nonsense
get
your
hat
on
and
come
and
sit
in
the
then
you
wo
let
me
go
he
felt
her
eyes
resting
on
him
with
a
strange
touching
look
let
you
go
he
said
and
what
on
earth
would
you
do
with
yourself
if
i
did
you
got
no
money
i
could
manage
he
took
a
swift
turn
up
and
down
the
room
then
came
and
stood
before
her
understand
he
said
once
and
for
all
i
wo
have
you
say
this
sort
of
thing
go
and
get
your
hat
on
she
did
not
move
i
suppose
said
soames
you
do
want
to
miss
bosinney
if
he
comes
irene
got
up
slowly
and
left
the
room
she
came
down
with
her
hat
on
they
went
out
in
the
park
the
motley
hour
of
when
foreigners
and
other
pathetic
folk
drive
thinking
themselves
to
be
in
fashion
had
passed
the
right
the
proper
hour
had
come
was
nearly
gone
before
soames
and
irene
seated
themselves
under
the
achilles
statue
it
was
some
time
since
he
had
enjoyed
her
company
in
the
park
that
was
one
of
the
past
delights
of
the
first
two
seasons
of
his
married
life
when
to
feel
himself
the
possessor
of
this
gracious
creature
before
all
london
had
been
his
greatest
though
secret
pride
how
many
afternoons
had
he
not
sat
beside
her
extremely
neat
with
light
grey
gloves
and
faint
supercilious
smile
nodding
to
acquaintances
and
now
and
again
removing
his
hat
his
light
grey
gloves
were
still
on
his
hands
and
on
his
lips
his
smile
sardonic
but
where
the
feeling
in
his
heart
the
seats
were
emptying
fast
but
still
he
kept
her
there
silent
and
pale
as
though
to
work
out
a
secret
punishment
once
or
twice
he
made
some
comment
and
she
bent
her
head
or
answered
yes
with
a
tired
smile
along
the
rails
a
man
was
walking
so
fast
that
people
stared
after
him
when
he
passed
look
at
that
ass
said
soames
he
must
be
mad
to
walk
like
that
in
this
heat
he
turned
irene
had
made
a
rapid
movement
hallo
he
said
it
our
friend
the
buccaneer
and
he
sat
still
with
his
sneering
smile
conscious
that
irene
was
sitting
still
and
smiling
too
will
she
bow
to
him
he
thought
but
she
made
no
sign
bosinney
reached
the
end
of
the
rails
and
came
walking
back
amongst
the
chairs
quartering
his
ground
like
a
pointer
when
he
saw
them
he
stopped
dead
and
raised
his
hat
the
smile
never
left
soames
face
he
also
took
off
his
hat
bosinney
came
up
looking
exhausted
like
a
man
after
hard
physical
exercise
the
sweat
stood
in
drops
on
his
brow
and
soames
smile
seemed
to
say
you
had
a
trying
time
my
friend
what
are
you
doing
in
the
park
he
asked
we
thought
you
despised
such
frivolity
bosinney
did
not
seem
to
hear
he
made
his
answer
to
irene
i
been
round
to
your
place
i
hoped
i
should
find
you
somebody
tapped
soames
on
the
back
and
spoke
to
him
and
in
the
exchange
of
those
platitudes
over
his
shoulder
he
missed
her
answer
and
took
a
resolution
we
just
going
in
he
said
to
bosinney
you
better
come
back
to
dinner
with
into
that
invitation
he
put
a
strange
bravado
a
stranger
pathos
you
ca
deceive
me
his
look
and
voice
seemed
saying
but
trust
not
afraid
of
you
they
started
back
to
montpellier
square
together
irene
between
them
in
the
crowded
streets
soames
went
on
in
front
he
did
not
listen
to
their
conversation
the
strange
resolution
of
trustfulness
he
had
taken
seemed
to
animate
even
his
secret
conduct
like
a
gambler
he
said
to
himself
a
card
i
dare
not
throw
must
play
it
for
what
it
worth
i
have
not
too
many
chances
he
dressed
slowly
heard
her
leave
her
room
and
go
downstairs
and
for
full
five
minutes
after
dawdled
about
in
his
then
he
went
down
purposely
shutting
the
door
loudly
to
show
that
he
was
coming
he
found
them
standing
by
the
hearth
perhaps
talking
perhaps
not
he
could
not
say
he
played
his
part
out
in
the
farce
the
long
evening
manner
to
his
guest
more
friendly
than
it
had
ever
been
before
and
when
at
last
bosinney
went
he
said
you
must
come
again
soon
irene
likes
to
have
you
to
talk
about
the
house
again
his
voice
had
the
strange
bravado
and
the
stranger
pathos
but
his
hand
was
cold
as
ice
loyal
to
his
resolution
he
turned
away
from
their
parting
turned
away
from
his
wife
as
she
stood
under
the
hanging
lamp
to
say
from
the
sight
of
her
golden
head
shining
so
under
the
light
of
her
smiling
mournful
lips
away
from
the
sight
of
bosinney
eyes
looking
at
her
so
like
a
dog
looking
at
its
master
and
he
went
to
bed
with
the
certainty
that
bosinney
was
in
love
with
his
wife
the
summer
night
was
hot
so
hot
and
still
that
through
every
opened
window
came
in
but
hotter
air
for
long
hours
he
lay
listening
to
her
breathing
she
could
sleep
but
he
must
lie
awake
and
lying
awake
he
hardened
himself
to
play
the
part
of
the
serene
and
trusting
husband
in
the
small
hours
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
passing
into
his
leaned
by
the
open
window
he
could
hardly
breathe
a
night
four
years
ago
came
back
to
night
but
one
before
his
marriage
as
hot
and
stifling
as
this
he
remembered
how
he
had
lain
in
a
long
cane
chair
in
the
window
of
his
off
victoria
street
down
below
in
a
side
street
a
man
had
banged
at
a
door
a
woman
had
cried
out
he
remembered
as
though
it
were
now
the
sound
of
the
scuffle
the
slam
of
the
door
the
dead
silence
that
followed
and
then
the
early
cleansing
the
reek
of
the
streets
had
approached
through
the
useless
he
seemed
to
hear
again
its
rumble
nearer
and
nearer
till
it
passed
and
slowly
died
away
he
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
over
the
little
court
below
and
saw
the
first
light
spread
the
outlines
of
dark
walls
and
roofs
were
blurred
for
a
moment
then
came
out
sharper
than
before
he
remembered
how
that
other
night
he
had
watched
the
lamps
paling
all
the
length
of
victoria
street
how
he
had
hurried
on
his
clothes
and
gone
down
into
the
street
down
past
houses
and
squares
to
the
street
where
she
was
staying
and
there
had
stood
and
looked
at
the
front
of
the
little
house
as
still
and
grey
as
the
face
of
a
dead
man
and
suddenly
it
shot
through
his
mind
like
a
sick
man
fancy
he
doing
fellow
who
haunts
me
who
was
here
this
evening
who
in
love
with
my
out
there
perhaps
looking
for
her
as
i
know
he
was
looking
for
her
this
afternoon
watching
my
house
now
for
all
i
can
tell
he
stole
across
the
landing
to
the
front
of
the
house
stealthily
drew
aside
a
blind
and
raised
a
window
the
grey
light
clung
about
the
trees
of
the
square
as
though
night
like
a
great
downy
moth
had
brushed
them
with
her
wings
the
lamps
were
still
alight
all
pale
but
not
a
soul
living
thing
in
sight
yet
suddenly
very
faint
far
off
in
the
deathly
stillness
he
heard
a
cry
writhing
like
the
voice
of
some
wandering
soul
barred
out
of
heaven
and
crying
for
its
happiness
there
it
was
soames
shut
the
window
shuddering
then
he
thought
it
only
the
peacocks
across
the
water
chapter
pays
some
calls
jolyon
stood
in
the
narrow
hall
at
broadstairs
inhaling
that
odour
of
oilcloth
and
herrings
which
permeates
all
respectable
seaside
on
a
shiny
leather
chair
displaying
its
horsehair
through
a
hole
in
the
top
a
black
despatch
case
this
he
was
filling
with
papers
with
the
times
and
a
bottle
of
cologne
he
had
meetings
that
day
of
the
gold
concessions
and
the
colliery
company
limited
to
which
he
was
going
up
for
he
never
missed
a
board
to
a
board
would
be
one
more
piece
of
evidence
that
he
was
growing
old
and
this
his
jealous
forsyte
spirit
could
not
bear
his
eyes
as
he
filled
that
black
despatch
case
looked
as
if
at
any
moment
they
might
blaze
up
with
anger
so
gleams
the
eye
of
a
schoolboy
baited
by
a
ring
of
his
companions
but
he
controls
himself
deterred
by
the
fearful
odds
against
him
and
old
jolyon
controlled
himself
keeping
down
with
his
masterful
restraint
now
slowly
wearing
out
the
irritation
fostered
in
him
by
the
conditions
of
his
life
he
had
received
from
his
son
an
unpractical
letter
in
which
by
rambling
generalities
the
boy
seemed
trying
to
get
out
of
answering
a
plain
question
seen
bosinney
he
said
is
not
a
criminal
the
more
i
see
of
people
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
they
are
never
good
or
comic
or
pathetic
you
probably
do
agree
with
me
old
jolyon
did
not
he
considered
it
cynical
to
so
express
oneself
he
had
not
yet
reached
that
point
of
old
age
when
even
forsytes
bereft
of
those
illusions
and
principles
which
they
have
cherished
carefully
for
practical
purposes
but
never
believed
in
bereft
of
all
corporeal
enjoyment
stricken
to
the
very
heart
by
having
nothing
left
to
hope
through
the
barriers
of
reserve
and
say
things
they
would
never
have
believed
themselves
capable
of
saying
perhaps
he
did
not
believe
in
and
any
more
than
his
son
but
as
he
would
have
said
he
did
tell
there
might
be
something
in
it
and
why
by
an
unnecessary
expression
of
disbelief
deprive
yourself
of
possible
advantage
accustomed
to
spend
his
holidays
among
the
mountains
though
like
a
true
forsyte
he
had
never
attempted
anything
too
adventurous
or
too
foolhardy
he
had
been
passionately
fond
of
them
and
when
the
wonderful
view
mentioned
in
but
disclosed
to
him
after
the
effort
of
the
climb
he
had
doubtless
felt
the
existence
of
some
great
dignified
principle
crowning
the
chaotic
strivings
the
petty
precipices
and
ironic
little
dark
chasms
of
life
this
was
as
near
to
religion
perhaps
as
his
practical
spirit
had
ever
gone
but
it
was
many
years
since
he
had
been
to
the
mountains
he
had
taken
june
there
two
seasons
running
after
his
wife
died
and
had
realized
bitterly
that
his
walking
days
were
over
to
that
old
confidence
in
a
supreme
order
of
things
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
he
knew
himself
to
be
old
yet
he
felt
young
and
this
troubled
him
it
troubled
and
puzzled
him
too
to
think
that
he
who
had
always
been
so
careful
should
be
father
and
grandfather
to
such
as
seemed
born
to
disaster
he
had
nothing
to
say
against
could
say
anything
against
the
boy
an
amiable
chap
his
position
was
deplorable
and
this
business
of
june
nearly
as
bad
it
seemed
like
a
fatality
and
a
fatality
was
one
of
those
things
no
man
of
his
character
could
either
understand
or
put
up
with
in
writing
to
his
son
he
did
not
really
hope
that
anything
would
come
of
it
since
the
ball
at
roger
he
had
seen
too
clearly
how
the
land
could
put
two
and
two
together
quicker
than
most
with
the
example
of
his
own
son
before
his
eyes
knew
better
than
any
forsyte
of
them
all
that
the
pale
flame
singes
men
wings
whether
they
will
or
no
in
the
days
before
june
engagement
when
she
and
soames
were
always
together
he
had
seen
enough
of
irene
to
feel
the
spell
she
cast
over
men
she
was
not
a
flirt
not
even
a
dear
to
the
heart
of
his
generation
which
loved
to
define
things
by
a
good
broad
inadequate
she
was
dangerous
he
could
not
say
why
tell
him
of
a
quality
innate
in
some
seductive
power
beyond
their
own
control
he
would
but
answer
she
was
dangerous
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
he
wanted
to
close
his
eyes
to
that
affair
if
it
was
it
was
he
did
not
want
to
hear
any
more
about
only
wanted
to
save
june
position
and
her
peace
of
mind
he
still
hoped
she
might
once
more
become
a
comfort
to
himself
and
so
he
had
written
he
got
little
enough
out
of
the
answer
as
to
what
young
jolyon
had
made
of
the
interview
there
was
practically
only
the
queer
sentence
gather
that
he
in
the
stream
the
stream
what
stream
what
was
this
way
of
talking
he
sighed
and
folded
the
last
of
the
papers
under
the
flap
of
the
bag
he
knew
well
enough
what
was
meant
june
came
out
of
the
and
helped
him
on
with
his
summer
coat
from
her
costume
and
the
expression
of
her
little
resolute
face
he
saw
at
once
what
was
coming
i
going
with
you
she
said
nonsense
my
dear
i
go
straight
into
the
city
i
ca
have
you
racketting
about
i
must
see
old
oh
your
precious
ducks
grumbled
out
old
jolyon
he
did
not
believe
her
excuse
but
ceased
his
opposition
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
that
pertinacity
of
hers
at
victoria
he
put
her
into
the
carriage
which
had
been
ordered
for
characteristic
action
for
he
had
no
petty
selfishnesses
now
do
you
go
tiring
yourself
my
darling
he
said
and
took
a
cab
on
into
the
city
june
went
first
to
a
in
paddington
where
smeech
her
duck
aged
person
connected
with
the
charring
interest
but
after
half
an
hour
spent
in
hearing
her
habitually
lamentable
recital
and
dragooning
her
into
temporary
comfort
she
went
on
to
stanhope
gate
the
great
house
was
closed
and
dark
she
had
decided
to
learn
something
at
all
costs
it
was
better
to
face
the
worst
and
have
it
over
and
this
was
her
plan
to
go
first
to
phil
aunt
baynes
and
failing
information
there
to
irene
herself
she
had
no
clear
notion
of
what
she
would
gain
by
these
visits
at
three
she
was
in
lowndes
square
with
a
woman
instinct
when
trouble
is
to
be
faced
she
had
put
on
her
best
frock
and
went
to
the
battle
with
a
glance
as
courageous
as
old
jolyon
itself
her
tremors
had
passed
into
eagerness
baynes
bosinney
aunt
louisa
was
her
name
was
in
her
kitchen
when
june
was
announced
organizing
the
cook
for
she
was
an
excellent
housewife
and
as
baynes
always
said
there
was
lot
in
a
good
dinner
he
did
his
best
work
after
dinner
it
was
baynes
who
built
that
remarkably
fine
row
of
tall
crimson
houses
in
kensington
which
compete
with
so
many
others
for
the
title
of
ugliest
in
london
on
hearing
june
name
she
went
hurriedly
to
her
bedroom
and
taking
two
large
bracelets
from
a
red
morocco
case
in
a
locked
drawer
put
them
on
her
white
she
possessed
in
a
remarkable
degree
that
of
property
which
as
we
know
is
the
touchstone
of
forsyteism
and
the
foundation
of
good
morality
her
figure
of
medium
height
and
broad
build
with
a
tendency
to
embonpoint
was
reflected
by
the
mirror
of
her
whitewood
wardrobe
in
a
gown
made
under
her
own
organization
of
one
of
those
reminiscent
of
the
distempered
walls
of
corridors
in
large
hotels
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
hair
which
she
wore
a
la
princesse
de
galles
and
touched
it
here
and
there
settling
it
more
firmly
on
her
head
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
an
unconscious
realism
as
though
she
were
looking
in
the
face
one
of
life
sordid
facts
and
making
the
best
of
it
in
youth
her
cheeks
had
been
of
cream
and
roses
but
they
were
mottled
now
by
and
again
that
hard
ugly
directness
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
dabbed
a
across
her
forehead
putting
the
puff
down
she
stood
quite
still
before
the
glass
arranging
a
smile
over
her
high
important
nose
her
chin
never
large
and
now
growing
smaller
with
the
increase
of
her
neck
her
mouth
quickly
not
to
lose
the
effect
she
grasped
her
skirts
strongly
in
both
hands
and
went
downstairs
she
had
been
hoping
for
this
visit
for
some
time
past
whispers
had
reached
her
that
things
were
not
all
right
between
her
nephew
and
his
fiancee
neither
of
them
had
been
near
her
for
weeks
she
had
asked
phil
to
dinner
many
times
his
invariable
answer
had
been
busy
her
instinct
was
alarmed
and
the
instinct
in
such
matters
of
this
excellent
woman
was
keen
she
ought
to
have
been
a
forsyte
in
young
jolyon
sense
of
the
word
she
certainly
had
that
privilege
and
merits
description
as
such
she
had
married
off
her
three
daughters
in
a
way
that
people
said
was
beyond
their
deserts
for
they
had
the
professional
plainness
only
to
be
found
as
a
rule
among
the
female
kind
of
the
more
legal
callings
her
name
was
upon
the
committees
of
numberless
charities
connected
with
the
theatricals
or
she
never
lent
her
name
unless
sure
beforehand
that
everything
had
been
thoroughly
organized
she
believed
as
she
often
said
in
putting
things
on
a
commercial
basis
the
proper
function
of
the
church
of
charity
indeed
of
everything
was
to
strengthen
the
fabric
of
individual
action
therefore
she
considered
immoral
organization
was
the
only
thing
for
by
organization
alone
could
you
feel
sure
that
you
were
getting
a
return
for
your
money
again
organization
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
was
what
old
jolyon
called
a
at
that
went
further
he
called
her
a
the
enterprises
to
which
she
lent
her
name
were
organized
so
admirably
that
by
the
time
the
takings
were
handed
over
they
were
indeed
skim
milk
divested
of
all
cream
of
human
kindness
but
as
she
often
justly
remarked
sentiment
was
to
be
deprecated
she
was
in
fact
a
little
academic
this
great
and
good
woman
so
highly
thought
of
in
ecclesiastical
circles
was
one
of
the
principal
priestesses
in
the
temple
of
forsyteism
keeping
alive
day
and
night
a
sacred
flame
to
the
god
of
property
whose
altar
is
inscribed
with
those
inspiring
words
for
nothing
and
really
remarkably
little
for
sixpence
when
she
entered
a
room
it
was
felt
that
something
substantial
had
come
in
which
was
probably
the
reason
of
her
popularity
as
a
patroness
people
liked
something
substantial
when
they
had
paid
money
for
it
and
they
would
look
at
by
her
staff
in
charity
ballrooms
with
her
high
nose
and
her
broad
square
figure
attired
in
an
uniform
covered
with
though
she
were
a
general
the
only
thing
against
her
was
that
she
had
not
a
double
name
she
was
a
power
in
upper
society
with
its
hundred
sets
and
circles
all
intersecting
on
the
common
battlefield
of
charity
functions
and
on
that
battlefield
brushing
skirts
so
pleasantly
with
the
skirts
of
society
with
the
capital
she
was
a
power
in
society
with
the
smaller
that
larger
more
significant
and
more
powerful
body
where
the
commercially
christian
institutions
maxims
and
which
baynes
embodied
were
real
circulating
freely
real
business
currency
not
merely
the
sterilized
imitation
that
flowed
in
the
veins
of
smaller
society
with
the
larger
people
who
knew
her
felt
her
to
be
sound
woman
who
never
gave
herself
away
nor
anything
else
if
she
could
possibly
help
it
she
had
been
on
the
worst
sort
of
terms
with
bosinney
father
who
had
not
infrequently
made
her
the
object
of
an
unpardonable
ridicule
she
alluded
to
him
now
that
he
was
gone
as
her
dear
irreverend
brother
she
greeted
june
with
the
careful
effusion
of
which
she
was
a
mistress
a
little
afraid
of
her
as
far
as
a
woman
of
her
eminence
in
the
commercial
and
christian
world
could
be
so
slight
a
girl
june
had
a
great
dignity
the
fearlessness
of
her
eyes
gave
her
that
and
baynes
too
shrewdly
recognized
that
behind
the
uncompromising
frankness
of
june
manner
there
was
much
of
the
forsyte
if
the
girl
had
been
merely
frank
and
courageous
baynes
would
have
thought
her
and
despised
her
if
she
had
been
merely
a
forsyte
like
us
would
have
patronized
her
from
sheer
weight
of
metal
but
june
small
though
she
baynes
habitually
admired
her
an
uneasy
feeling
and
she
placed
her
in
a
chair
opposite
the
light
there
was
another
reason
for
her
respect
which
baynes
too
good
a
churchwoman
to
be
worldly
would
have
been
the
last
to
often
heard
her
husband
describe
old
jolyon
as
extremely
well
off
and
was
biassed
towards
his
granddaughter
for
the
soundest
of
all
reasons
she
felt
the
emotion
with
which
we
read
a
novel
describing
a
hero
and
an
inheritance
nervously
anxious
lest
by
some
frightful
lapse
of
the
novelist
the
young
man
should
be
left
without
it
at
the
end
her
manner
was
warm
she
had
never
seen
so
clearly
before
how
distinguished
and
desirable
a
girl
this
was
she
asked
after
old
jolyon
health
a
wonderful
man
for
his
age
so
upright
and
young
looking
and
how
old
was
he
she
would
never
have
thought
it
they
were
at
the
sea
very
nice
for
them
she
supposed
june
heard
from
phil
every
day
her
light
grey
eyes
became
more
prominent
as
she
asked
this
question
but
the
girl
met
the
glance
without
flinching
no
she
said
he
never
writes
baynes
eyes
dropped
they
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
but
they
did
they
recovered
immediately
of
course
not
that
phil
all
was
always
like
that
was
he
said
june
the
brevity
of
the
answer
caused
baynes
bright
smile
a
hesitation
she
disguised
it
by
a
quick
movement
and
spreading
her
skirts
afresh
said
why
my
quite
the
most
person
one
never
pays
the
slightest
attention
to
what
he
does
the
conviction
came
suddenly
to
june
that
she
was
wasting
her
time
even
were
she
to
put
a
question
she
would
never
get
anything
out
of
this
woman
you
see
him
she
asked
her
face
crimsoning
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
baynes
forehead
beneath
the
powder
oh
yes
i
do
remember
when
he
was
here
we
seen
much
of
him
lately
he
so
busy
with
your
cousin
house
told
it
be
finished
directly
we
must
organize
a
little
dinner
to
celebrate
the
event
do
come
and
stay
the
night
with
us
thank
you
said
june
again
she
thought
only
wasting
my
time
this
woman
will
tell
me
nothing
she
got
up
to
go
a
change
came
over
baynes
she
rose
too
her
lips
twitched
she
fidgeted
her
hands
something
was
evidently
very
wrong
and
she
did
not
dare
to
ask
this
girl
who
stood
there
a
slim
straight
little
figure
with
her
decided
face
her
set
jaw
and
resentful
eyes
she
was
not
accustomed
to
be
afraid
of
asking
organization
was
based
on
the
asking
of
questions
but
the
issue
was
so
grave
that
her
nerve
normally
strong
was
fairly
shaken
only
that
morning
her
husband
had
said
old
forsyte
must
be
worth
well
over
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
this
girl
stood
there
holding
out
her
out
her
hand
the
chance
might
be
slipping
could
chance
of
keeping
her
in
the
family
and
yet
she
dared
not
speak
her
eyes
followed
june
to
the
door
it
closed
then
with
an
exclamation
baynes
ran
forward
wobbling
her
bulky
frame
from
side
to
side
and
opened
it
again
too
late
she
heard
the
front
door
click
and
stood
still
an
expression
of
real
anger
and
mortification
on
her
face
june
went
along
the
square
with
her
quickness
she
detested
that
woman
now
whom
in
happier
days
she
had
been
accustomed
to
think
so
kind
was
she
always
to
be
put
off
thus
and
forced
to
undergo
this
torturing
suspense
she
would
go
to
phil
himself
and
ask
him
what
he
meant
she
had
the
right
to
know
she
hurried
on
down
sloane
street
till
she
came
to
bosinney
number
passing
the
at
the
bottom
she
ran
up
the
stairs
her
heart
thumping
painfully
at
the
top
of
the
third
flight
she
paused
for
breath
and
holding
on
to
the
bannisters
stood
listening
no
sound
came
from
above
with
a
very
white
face
she
mounted
the
last
flight
she
saw
the
door
with
his
name
on
the
plate
and
the
resolution
that
had
brought
her
so
far
evaporated
the
full
meaning
of
her
conduct
came
to
her
she
felt
hot
all
over
the
palms
of
her
hands
were
moist
beneath
the
thin
silk
covering
of
her
gloves
she
drew
back
to
the
stairs
but
did
not
descend
leaning
against
the
rail
she
tried
to
get
rid
of
a
feeling
of
being
choked
and
she
gazed
at
the
door
with
a
sort
of
dreadful
courage
no
she
refused
to
go
down
did
it
matter
what
people
thought
of
her
they
would
never
know
no
one
would
help
her
if
she
did
not
help
herself
she
would
go
through
with
it
forcing
herself
therefore
to
leave
the
support
of
the
wall
she
rang
the
bell
the
door
did
not
open
and
all
her
shame
and
fear
suddenly
abandoned
her
she
rang
again
and
again
as
though
in
spite
of
its
emptiness
she
could
drag
some
response
out
of
that
closed
room
some
recompense
for
the
shame
and
fear
that
visit
had
cost
her
it
did
not
open
she
left
off
ringing
and
sitting
down
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
presently
she
stole
down
out
into
the
air
she
felt
as
though
she
had
passed
through
a
bad
illness
and
had
no
desire
now
but
to
get
home
as
quickly
as
she
could
the
people
she
met
seemed
to
know
where
she
had
been
what
she
had
been
doing
and
on
the
opposite
side
going
towards
his
rooms
from
the
direction
of
montpellier
saw
bosinney
himself
she
made
a
movement
to
cross
into
the
traffic
their
eyes
met
and
he
raised
his
hat
an
omnibus
passed
obscuring
her
view
then
from
the
edge
of
the
pavement
through
a
gap
in
the
traffic
she
saw
him
walking
on
and
june
stood
motionless
looking
after
him
chapter
of
the
house
mockturtle

two
glasses
of
port
in
the
upper
room
at
french
where
a
forsyte
could
still
get
heavy
english
food
james
and
his
son
were
sitting
down
to
lunch
of
all
james
liked
best
to
come
here
there
was
something
unpretentious
and
filling
about
it
and
though
he
had
been
to
a
certain
extent
corrupted
by
the
necessity
for
being
fashionable
and
the
trend
of
habits
keeping
pace
with
an
income
that
would
increase
he
still
hankered
in
quiet
city
moments
after
the
tasty
fleshpots
of
his
earlier
days
here
you
were
served
by
hairy
english
waiters
in
aprons
there
was
sawdust
on
the
floor
and
three
round
gilt
hung
just
above
the
line
of
sight
they
had
only
recently
done
away
with
the
cubicles
too
in
which
you
could
have
your
chop

a
without
seeing
your
neighbours
like
a
gentleman
he
tucked
the
top
corner
of
his
napkin
behind
the
third
button
of
his
waistcoat
a
practice
he
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
years
ago
in
the
west
end
he
felt
that
he
should
relish
his
entire
morning
had
been
given
to
winding
up
the
estate
of
an
old
friend
after
filling
his
mouth
with
household
bread
stale

at
once
began
how

mumbled
james
i
never

trouble
with
them
she
had
too
much
liberty
spoiled
soames
lifted
his
eyes
i
wo
have
anything
said
against
her
he
said
unexpectedly
the
silence
was
only
broken
now
by
the
supping
of
james
soup
the
waiter
brought
the
two
glasses
of
port
but
soames
stopped
him
that
not
the
way
to
serve
port
he
said
take
them
away
and
bring
the
rousing
himself
from
his
reverie
over
the
soup
james
took
one
of
his
rapid
shifting
surveys
of
surrounding
facts
your
mother
in
bed
he
said

he
signed
to
the
waiter
to
bring
the
bill
which
james
paid
they
parted
at
paul
soames
branching
off
to
the
station
james
taking
his
omnibus
westwards
he
had
secured
the
corner
seat
next
the
conductor
where
his
long
legs
made
it
difficult
for
anyone
to
get
in
and
at
all
who
passed
him
he
looked
resentfully
as
if
they
had
no
business
to
be
using
up
his
air
he
intended
to
take
an
opportunity
this
afternoon
of
speaking
to
irene
a
word
in
time
saved
nine
and
now
that
she
was
going
to
live
in
the
country
there
was
a
chance
for
her
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
he
could
see
that
soames
would
stand
very
much
more
of
her
goings
on
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
define
what
he
meant
by
her
on
the
expression
was
wide
vague
and
suited
to
a
forsyte
and
james
had
more
than
his
common
share
of
courage
after
lunch
on
reaching
home
he
ordered
out
the
barouche
with
special
instructions
that
the
groom
was
to
go
too
he
wished
to
be
kind
to
her
and
to
give
her
every
chance
when
the
door
of
was
opened
he
could
distinctly
hear
her
singing
and
said
so
at
once
to
prevent
any
chance
of
being
denied
entrance
yes
soames
was
in
but
the
maid
did
not
know
if
she
was
seeing
people
james
moving
with
the
rapidity
that
ever
astonished
the
observers
of
his
long
figure
and
absorbed
expression
went
forthwith
into
the
without
permitting
this
to
be
ascertained
he
found
irene
seated
at
the
piano
with
her
hands
arrested
on
the
keys
evidently
listening
to
the
voices
in
the
hall
she
greeted
him
without
smiling
your
in
bed
he
began
hoping
at
once
to
enlist
her
sympathy
i
got
the
carriage
here
now
be
a
good
girl
and
put
on
your
hat
and
come
with
me
for
a
drive
it
do
you
good
irene
looked
at
him
as
though
about
to
refuse
but
seeming
to
change
her
mind
went
upstairs
and
came
down
again
with
her
hat
on
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
she
asked
we
just
go
down
to
robin
hill
said
james
spluttering
out
his
words
very
quick
the
horses
want
exercise
and
i
should
like
to
see
what
they
been
doing
down
irene
hung
back
but
again
changed
her
mind
and
went
out
to
the
carriage
james
brooding
over
her
closely
to
make
quite
sure
it
was
not
before
he
had
got
her
more
than
half
way
that
he
began
soames
is
very
fond
of
wo
have
anything
said
against
you
why
do
you
show
him
more
affection
irene
flushed
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
ca
show
what
i
james
looked
at
her
sharply
he
felt
that
now
he
had
her
in
his
own
carriage
with
his
own
horses
and
servants
he
was
really
in
command
of
the
situation
she
could
not
put
him
off
nor
would
she
make
a
scene
in
public
i
ca
think
what
you
about
he
said
he
a
very
good
husband
irene
answer
was
so
low
as
to
be
almost
inaudible
among
the
sounds
of
traffic
he
caught
the
words
you
are
not
married
to
him
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
he
given
you
everything
you
want
always
ready
to
take
you
anywhere
and
now
he
built
you
this
house
in
the
country
it
not
as
if
you
had
anything
of
your
again
james
looked
at
her
he
could
not
make
out
the
expression
on
her
face
she
looked
almost
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
and
yet
i
sure
he
muttered
hastily
we
all
tried
to
be
kind
to
irene
lips
quivered
to
his
dismay
james
saw
a
tear
steal
down
her
cheek
he
felt
a
choke
rise
in
his
own
throat
we
all
fond
of
you
he
said
if
you
only
was
going
to
say
behave
yourself
but
changed
it
if
you
only
be
more
of
a
wife
to
irene
did
not
answer
and
james
too
ceased
speaking
there
was
something
in
her
silence
which
disconcerted
him
it
was
not
the
silence
of
obstinacy
rather
that
of
acquiescence
in
all
that
he
could
find
to
say
and
yet
he
felt
as
if
he
had
not
had
the
last
word
he
could
not
understand
this
he
was
unable
however
to
long
keep
silence
i
suppose
that
young
bosinney
he
said
will
be
getting
married
to
june
now
irene
face
changed
i
do
know
she
said
you
should
ask
does
she
write
to
you
how
that
said
james
i
thought
you
and
she
were
such
great
irene
turned
on
him
again
she
said
you
should
ask
her
well
flustered
james
frightened
by
her
look
it
very
odd
that
i
ca
get
a
plain
answer
to
a
plain
question
but
there
it
he
sat
ruminating
over
his
rebuff
and
burst
out
at
last
well
i
warned
you
you
wo
look
ahead
soames
he
does
say
much
but
i
can
see
he
wo
stand
a
great
deal
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
you
have
nobody
but
yourself
to
blame
and
what
more
you
get
no
sympathy
from
irene
bent
her
head
with
a
little
smiling
bow
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
james
did
not
know
what
on
earth
to
answer
the
bright
hot
morning
had
changed
slowly
to
a
grey
oppressive
afternoon
a
heavy
bank
of
clouds
with
the
yellow
tinge
of
coming
thunder
had
risen
in
the
south
and
was
creeping
up
the
branches
of
the
trees
dropped
motionless
across
the
road
without
the
smallest
stir
of
foliage
a
faint
odour
of
glue
from
the
heated
horses
clung
in
the
thick
air
the
coachman
and
groom
rigid
and
unbending
exchanged
stealthy
murmurs
on
the
box
without
ever
turning
their
heads
to
james
great
relief
they
reached
the
house
at
last
the
silence
and
impenetrability
of
this
woman
by
his
side
whom
he
had
always
thought
so
soft
and
mild
alarmed
him
the
carriage
put
them
down
at
the
door
and
they
entered
the
hall
was
cool
and
so
still
that
it
was
like
passing
into
a
tomb
a
shudder
ran
down
james
spine
he
quickly
lifted
the
heavy
leather
curtains
between
the
columns
into
the
inner
court
he
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
approval
the
decoration
was
really
in
excellent
taste
the
dull
ruby
tiles
that
extended
from
the
foot
of
the
walls
to
the
verge
of
a
circular
clump
of
tall
iris
plants
surrounding
in
turn
a
sunken
basin
of
white
marble
filled
with
water
were
obviously
of
the
best
quality
he
admired
extremely
the
purple
leather
curtains
drawn
along
one
entire
side
framing
a
huge
stove
the
central
partitions
of
the
skylight
had
been
slid
back
and
the
warm
air
from
outside
penetrated
into
the
very
heart
of
the
house
he
stood
his
hands
behind
him
his
head
bent
back
on
his
high
narrow
shoulders
spying
the
tracery
on
the
columns
and
the
pattern
of
the
frieze
which
ran
round
the
walls
under
the
gallery
evidently
no
pains
had
been
spared
it
was
quite
the
house
of
a
gentleman
he
went
up
to
the
curtains
and
having
discovered
how
they
were
worked
drew
them
asunder
and
disclosed
the
ending
in
a
great
window
taking
up
the
whole
end
of
the
room
it
had
a
black
oak
floor
and
its
walls
again
were
of
ivory
white
he
went
on
throwing
open
doors
and
peeping
in
everything
was
in
order
ready
for
immediate
occupation
he
turned
round
at
last
to
speak
to
irene
and
saw
her
standing
over
in
the
garden
entrance
with
her
husband
and
bosinney
though
not
remarkable
for
sensibility
james
felt
at
once
that
something
was
wrong
he
went
up
to
them
and
vaguely
alarmed
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
trouble
made
an
attempt
to
smooth
things
over
how
are
you
bosinney
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
you
been
spending
money
pretty
freely
down
here
i
should
say
soames
turned
his
back
and
walked
away
james
looked
from
bosinney
frowning
face
to
irene
and
in
his
agitation
spoke
his
thoughts
aloud
well
i
ca
tell
what
the
matter
nobody
tells
me
anything
and
making
off
after
his
son
he
heard
bosinney
short
laugh
and
his
well
thank
god
you
look
so
most
unfortunately
he
lost
the
rest
what
had
happened
he
glanced
back
irene
was
very
close
to
the
architect
and
her
face
not
like
the
face
he
knew
of
her
he
hastened
up
to
his
son
soames
was
pacing
the
what
the
matter
said
james
what
all
this
soames
looked
at
him
with
his
supercilious
calm
unbroken
but
james
knew
well
enough
that
he
was
violently
angry
our
friend
he
said
has
exceeded
his
instructions
again
that
all
so
much
the
worse
for
him
this
he
turned
round
and
walked
back
towards
the
door
james
followed
hurriedly
edging
himself
in
front
he
saw
irene
take
her
finger
from
before
her
lips
heard
her
say
something
in
her
ordinary
voice
and
began
to
speak
before
he
reached
them
there
a
storm
coming
on
we
better
get
home
we
ca
take
you
i
suppose
bosinney
no
i
suppose
not
then
he
held
out
his
hand
bosinney
did
not
take
it
but
turning
with
a
laugh
said
forsyte
do
get
caught
in
the
storm
and
walked
away
well
began
james
i
do
know
but
the
sight
of
irene
face
stopped
him
taking
hold
of
his
by
the
elbow
he
escorted
her
towards
the
carriage
he
felt
certain
quite
certain
they
had
been
making
some
appointment
or
other
nothing
in
this
world
is
more
sure
to
upset
a
forsyte
than
the
discovery
that
something
on
which
he
has
stipulated
to
spend
a
certain
sum
has
cost
more
and
this
is
reasonable
for
upon
the
accuracy
of
his
estimates
the
whole
policy
of
his
life
is
ordered
if
he
can
not
rely
on
definite
values
of
property
his
compass
is
amiss
he
is
adrift
upon
bitter
waters
without
a
helm
after
writing
to
bosinney
in
the
terms
that
have
already
been
chronicled
soames
had
dismissed
the
cost
of
the
house
from
his
mind
he
believed
that
he
had
made
the
matter
of
the
final
cost
so
very
plain
that
the
possibility
of
its
being
again
exceeded
had
really
never
entered
his
head
on
hearing
from
bosinney
that
his
limit
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
would
be
exceeded
by
something
like
four
hundred
he
had
grown
white
with
anger
his
original
estimate
of
the
cost
of
the
house
completed
had
been
ten
thousand
pounds
and
he
had
often
blamed
himself
severely
for
allowing
himself
to
be
led
into
repeated
excesses
over
this
last
expenditure
however
bosinney
had
put
himself
completely
in
the
wrong
how
on
earth
a
fellow
could
make
such
an
ass
of
himself
soames
could
not
conceive
but
he
had
done
so
and
all
the
rancour
and
hidden
jealousy
that
had
been
burning
against
him
for
so
long
was
now
focussed
in
rage
at
this
crowning
piece
of
extravagance
the
attitude
of
the
confident
and
friendly
husband
was
gone
to
preserve
had
assumed
it
to
preserve
property
of
another
kind
he
lost
it
now
ah
he
had
said
to
bosinney
when
he
could
speak
and
i
suppose
perfectly
contented
with
yourself
but
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
you
altogether
mistaken
your
man
what
he
meant
by
those
words
he
did
not
quite
know
at
the
time
but
after
dinner
he
looked
up
the
correspondence
between
himself
and
bosinney
to
make
quite
sure
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
about
fellow
had
made
himself
liable
for
that
extra
four
hundred
or
at
all
events
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
it
and
he
would
have
to
make
it
good
he
was
looking
at
his
wife
face
when
he
came
to
this
conclusion
seated
in
her
usual
seat
on
the
sofa
she
was
altering
the
lace
on
a
collar
she
had
not
once
spoken
to
him
all
the
evening
he
went
up
to
the
mantelpiece
and
contemplating
his
face
in
the
mirror
said
your
friend
the
buccaneer
has
made
a
fool
of
himself
he
will
have
to
pay
for
it
she
looked
at
him
scornfully
and
answered
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
you
soon
will
a
mere
trifle
quite
beneath
your
hundred
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
make
him
pay
that
towards
this
hateful
house
i
and
you
know
he
got
nothing
then
you
are
meaner
than
i
thought
soames
turned
from
the
mirror
and
unconsciously
taking
a
china
cup
from
the
mantelpiece
clasped
his
hands
around
it
as
though
praying
he
saw
her
bosom
rise
and
fall
her
eyes
darkening
with
anger
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
taunt
he
asked
quietly
are
you
carrying
on
a
flirtation
with
bosinney
no
i
am
not
her
eyes
met
his
and
he
looked
away
he
neither
believed
nor
disbelieved
her
but
he
knew
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
asking
he
never
had
known
never
would
know
what
she
was
thinking
the
sight
of
her
inscrutable
face
the
thought
of
all
the
hundreds
of
evenings
he
had
seen
her
sitting
there
like
that
soft
and
passive
but
unreadable
unknown
enraged
him
beyond
measure
i
believe
you
are
made
of
stone
he
said
clenching
his
fingers
so
hard
that
he
broke
the
fragile
cup
the
pieces
fell
into
the
grate
and
irene
smiled
you
seem
to
forget
she
said
that
cup
is
not
soames
gripped
her
arm
a
good
beating
he
said
is
the
only
thing
that
would
bring
you
to
your
senses
but
turning
on
his
heel
he
left
the
room
chapter
sits
on
the
stairs
soames
went
that
night
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
gone
too
far
he
was
prepared
to
offer
excuses
for
his
words
he
turned
out
the
gas
still
burning
in
the
passage
outside
their
room
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
he
tried
to
shape
his
apology
for
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
her
see
that
he
was
nervous
but
the
door
did
not
open
nor
when
he
pulled
it
and
turned
the
handle
firmly
she
must
have
locked
it
for
some
reason
and
forgotten
entering
his
where
the
gas
was
also
lighted
and
burning
low
he
went
quickly
to
the
other
door
that
too
was
locked
then
he
noticed
that
the
camp
bed
which
he
occasionally
used
was
prepared
and
his
laid
out
upon
it
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
forehead
and
brought
it
away
wet
it
dawned
on
him
that
he
was
barred
out
he
went
back
to
the
door
and
rattling
the
handle
stealthily
called
unlock
the
door
do
you
hear
unlock
the
door
there
was
a
faint
rustling
but
no
answer
do
you
hear
let
me
in
at
insist
on
being
let
in
he
could
catch
the
sound
of
her
breathing
close
to
the
door
like
the
breathing
of
a
creature
threatened
by
danger
there
was
something
terrifying
in
this
inexorable
silence
in
the
impossibility
of
getting
at
her
he
went
back
to
the
other
door
and
putting
his
whole
weight
against
it
tried
to
burst
it
open
the
door
was
a
new
had
had
them
renewed
himself
in
readiness
for
their
coming
in
after
the
honeymoon
in
a
rage
he
lifted
his
foot
to
kick
in
the
panel
the
thought
of
the
servants
restrained
him
and
he
felt
suddenly
that
he
was
beaten
flinging
himself
down
in
the
he
took
up
a
book
but
instead
of
the
print
he
seemed
to
see
his
her
yellow
hair
flowing
over
her
bare
shoulders
and
her
great
dark
like
an
animal
at
bay
and
the
whole
meaning
of
her
act
of
revolt
came
to
him
she
meant
it
to
be
for
good
he
could
not
sit
still
and
went
to
the
door
again
he
could
still
hear
her
and
he
called
irene
irene
he
did
not
mean
to
make
his
voice
pathetic
in
ominous
answer
the
faint
sounds
ceased
he
stood
with
clenched
hands
thinking
presently
he
stole
round
on
tiptoe
and
running
suddenly
at
the
other
door
made
a
supreme
effort
to
break
it
open
it
creaked
but
did
not
yield
he
sat
down
on
the
stairs
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
for
a
long
time
he
sat
there
in
the
dark
the
moon
through
the
skylight
above
laying
a
pale
smear
which
lengthened
slowly
towards
him
down
the
stairway
he
tried
to
be
philosophical
since
she
had
locked
her
doors
she
had
no
further
claim
as
a
wife
and
he
would
console
himself
with
other
women
it
was
but
a
spectral
journey
he
made
among
such
had
no
appetite
for
these
exploits
he
had
never
had
much
and
he
had
lost
the
habit
he
felt
that
he
could
never
recover
it
his
hunger
could
only
be
appeased
by
his
wife
inexorable
and
frightened
behind
these
shut
doors
no
other
woman
could
help
him
this
conviction
came
to
him
with
terrible
force
out
there
in
the
dark
his
philosophy
left
him
and
surly
anger
took
its
place
her
conduct
was
immoral
inexcusable
worthy
of
any
punishment
within
his
power
he
desired
no
one
but
her
and
she
refused
him
she
must
really
hate
him
then
he
had
never
believed
it
yet
he
did
not
believe
it
now
it
seemed
to
him
incredible
he
felt
as
though
he
had
lost
for
ever
his
power
of
judgment
if
she
so
soft
and
yielding
as
he
had
always
judged
her
could
take
this
decided
could
not
happen
then
he
asked
himself
again
if
she
were
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
bosinney
he
did
not
believe
that
she
was
he
could
not
afford
to
believe
such
a
reason
for
her
thought
was
not
to
be
faced
it
would
be
unbearable
to
contemplate
the
necessity
of
making
his
marital
relations
public
property
short
of
the
most
convincing
proofs
he
must
still
refuse
to
believe
for
he
did
not
wish
to
punish
himself
and
all
the
time
at
did
believe
the
moonlight
cast
a
greyish
tinge
over
his
figure
hunched
against
the
staircase
wall
bosinney
was
in
love
with
her
he
hated
the
fellow
and
would
not
spare
him
now
he
could
and
would
refuse
to
pay
a
penny
piece
over
twelve
thousand
and
fifty
extreme
limit
fixed
in
the
correspondence
or
rather
he
would
pay
he
would
pay
and
sue
him
for
damages
he
would
go
to
jobling
and
boulter
and
put
the
matter
in
their
hands
he
would
ruin
the
impecunious
beggar
and
what
connection
between
the
thoughts
reflected
that
irene
had
no
money
either
they
were
both
beggars
this
gave
him
a
strange
satisfaction
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
faint
creaking
through
the
wall
she
was
going
to
bed
at
last
ah
joy
and
pleasant
dreams
if
she
threw
the
door
open
wide
he
would
not
go
in
now
but
his
lips
that
were
twisted
in
a
bitter
smile
twitched
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
it
was
late
the
following
afternoon
when
soames
stood
in
the
window
gazing
gloomily
into
the
square
the
sunlight
still
showered
on
the
and
in
the
breeze
their
gay
broad
leaves
shone
and
swung
in
rhyme
to
a
barrel
organ
at
the
corner
it
was
playing
a
waltz
an
old
waltz
that
was
out
of
fashion
with
a
fateful
rhythm
in
the
notes
and
it
went
on
and
on
though
nothing
indeed
but
leaves
danced
to
the
tune
the
woman
did
not
look
too
gay
for
she
was
tired
and
from
the
tall
houses
no
one
threw
her
down
coppers
she
moved
the
organ
on
and
three
doors
off
began
again
it
was
the
waltz
they
had
played
at
roger
when
irene
had
danced
with
bosinney
and
the
perfume
of
the
gardenias
she
had
worn
came
back
to
soames
drifted
by
the
malicious
music
as
it
had
been
drifted
to
him
then
when
she
passed
her
hair
glistening
her
eyes
so
soft
drawing
bosinney
on
and
on
down
an
endless
ballroom
the
organ
woman
plied
her
handle
slowly
she
had
been
grinding
her
tune
all
it
in
sloane
street
hard
by
grinding
it
perhaps
to
bosinney
himself
soames
turned
took
a
cigarette
from
the
carven
box
and
walked
back
to
the
window
the
tune
had
mesmerized
him
and
there
came
into
his
view
irene
her
sunshade
furled
hastening
homewards
down
the
square
in
a
soft
blouse
with
drooping
sleeves
that
he
did
not
know
she
stopped
before
the
organ
took
out
her
purse
and
gave
the
woman
money
soames
shrank
back
and
stood
where
he
could
see
into
the
hall
she
came
in
with
her
put
down
her
sunshade
and
stood
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
her
cheeks
were
flushed
as
if
the
sun
had
burned
them
her
lips
were
parted
in
a
smile
she
stretched
her
arms
out
as
though
to
embrace
herself
with
a
laugh
that
for
all
the
world
was
like
a
sob
soames
stepped
forward
he
said
but
as
though
shot
she
spun
round
and
would
have
passed
him
up
the
stairs
he
barred
the
way
why
such
a
hurry
he
said
and
his
eyes
fastened
on
a
curl
of
hair
fallen
loose
across
her
ear
he
hardly
recognised
her
she
seemed
on
fire
so
deep
and
rich
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
her
eyes
her
lips
and
of
the
unusual
blouse
she
wore
she
put
up
her
hand
and
smoothed
back
the
curl
she
was
breathing
fast
and
deep
as
though
she
had
been
running
and
with
every
breath
perfume
seemed
to
come
from
her
hair
and
from
her
body
like
perfume
from
an
opening
flower
i
do
like
that
blouse
he
said
slowly
it
a
soft
shapeless
thing
he
lifted
his
finger
towards
her
breast
but
she
dashed
his
hand
aside
do
touch
me
she
cried
he
caught
her
wrist
she
wrenched
it
away
and
where
may
you
have
been
he
asked
in
of
this
house
with
those
words
she
fled
upstairs
the
very
door
the
was
playing
the
waltz
and
soames
stood
motionless
what
prevented
him
from
following
her
was
it
that
with
the
eyes
of
faith
he
saw
bosinney
looking
down
from
that
high
window
in
sloane
street
straining
his
eyes
for
yet
another
glimpse
of
irene
vanished
figure
cooling
his
flushed
face
dreaming
of
the
moment
when
she
flung
herself
on
his
scent
of
her
still
in
the
air
around
and
the
sound
of
her
laugh
that
was
like
a
sob
part
iii
chapter
macander
evidence
many
people
no
doubt
including
the
editor
of
the
vivisectionist
then
in
the
bloom
of
its
first
youth
would
say
that
soames
was
less
than
a
man
not
to
have
removed
the
locks
from
his
doors
and
after
beating
her
soundly
resumed
wedded
happiness
brutality
is
not
so
deplorably
diluted
by
humaneness
as
it
used
to
be
yet
a
sentimental
segment
of
the
population
may
still
be
relieved
to
learn
that
he
did
none
of
these
things
for
active
brutality
is
not
popular
with
forsytes
they
are
too
circumspect
and
on
the
whole
too
softhearted
and
in
soames
there
was
some
common
pride
not
sufficient
to
make
him
do
a
really
generous
action
but
enough
to
prevent
his
indulging
in
an
extremely
mean
one
except
perhaps
in
very
hot
blood
above
all
this
a
true
forsyte
refused
to
feel
himself
ridiculous
short
of
actually
beating
his
wife
he
perceived
nothing
to
be
done
he
therefore
accepted
the
situation
without
another
word
throughout
the
summer
and
autumn
he
continued
to
go
to
the
office
to
sort
his
pictures
and
ask
his
friends
to
dinner
he
did
not
leave
town
irene
refused
to
go
away
the
house
at
robin
hill
finished
though
it
was
remained
empty
and
ownerless
soames
had
brought
a
suit
against
the
buccaneer
in
which
he
claimed
from
him
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
firm
of
solicitors
freak
and
able
had
put
in
a
defence
on
bosinney
behalf
admitting
the
facts
they
raised
a
point
on
the
correspondence
which
divested
of
legal
phraseology
amounted
to
this
to
speak
of
free
hand
in
the
terms
of
this
correspondence
is
an
irish
bull
by
a
chance
fortuitous
but
not
improbable
in
the
close
borough
of
legal
circles
a
good
deal
of
information
came
to
soames
ear
anent
this
line
of
policy
the
working
partner
in
his
firm
bustard
happening
to
sit
next
at
dinner
at
walmisley
the
taxing
master
to
young
chankery
of
the
common
law
bar
the
necessity
for
talking
what
is
known
as
which
comes
on
all
lawyers
with
the
removal
of
the
ladies
caused
chankery
a
young
and
promising
advocate
to
propound
an
impersonal
conundrum
to
his
neighbour
whose
name
he
did
not
know
for
seated
as
he
permanently
was
in
the
background
bustard
had
practically
no
name
he
had
said
chankery
a
case
coming
on
with
a
nice
point
he
then
explained
preserving
every
professional
discretion
the
riddle
in
soames
case
everyone
he
said
to
whom
he
had
spoken
thought
it
a
nice
point
the
issue
was
small
unfortunately
serious
for
his
client
he
champagne
was
bad
but
plentiful
a
judge
would
make
short
work
of
it
he
was
afraid
he
intended
to
make
a
big
point
was
a
nice
one
what
did
his
neighbour
say
bustard
a
model
of
secrecy
said
nothing
he
related
the
incident
to
soames
however
with
some
malice
for
this
quiet
man
was
capable
of
human
feeling
ending
with
his
own
opinion
that
the
point
was
very
nice
one
in
accordance
with
his
resolve
our
forsyte
had
put
his
interests
into
the
hands
of
jobling
and
boulter
from
the
moment
of
doing
so
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
acted
for
himself
on
receiving
a
copy
of
bosinney
defence
he
went
over
to
their
offices
boulter
who
had
the
matter
in
hand
jobling
having
died
some
years
before
told
him
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
rather
a
nice
point
he
would
like
counsel
opinion
on
it
soames
told
him
to
go
to
a
good
man
and
they
went
to
waterbuck
marking
him
ten
and
one
who
kept
the
papers
six
weeks
and
then
wrote
as
follows
my
opinion
the
true
interpretation
of
this
correspondence
depends
very
much
on
the
intention
of
the
parties
and
will
turn
upon
the
evidence
given
at
the
trial
i
am
of
opinion
that
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
secure
from
the
architect
an
admission
that
he
understood
he
was
not
to
spend
at
the
outside
more
than
twelve
thousand
and
fifty
pounds
with
regard
to
the
expression
a
free
hand
in
the
terms
of
this
correspondence
to
which
my
attention
is
directed
the
point
is
a
nice
one
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
upon
the
whole
the
ruling
in
boileau
the
blasted
cement
will
apply
upon
this
opinion
they
acted
administering
interrogatories
but
to
their
annoyance
freak
and
able
answered
these
in
so
masterly
a
fashion
that
nothing
whatever
was
admitted
and
that
without
prejudice
it
was
on
october
that
soames
read
waterbuck
opinion
in
the
before
dinner
it
made
him
nervous
not
so
much
because
of
the
case
of
the
blasted
cement
as
that
the
point
had
lately
begun
to
seem
to
him
too
a
nice
one
there
was
about
it
just
that
pleasant
flavour
of
subtlety
so
attractive
to
the
best
legal
appetites
to
have
his
own
impression
confirmed
by
waterbuck
would
have
disturbed
any
man
he
sat
thinking
it
over
and
staring
at
the
empty
grate
for
though
autumn
had
come
the
weather
kept
as
gloriously
fine
that
jubilee
year
as
if
it
were
still
high
august
it
was
not
pleasant
to
be
disturbed
he
desired
too
passionately
to
set
his
foot
on
bosinney
neck
though
he
had
not
seen
the
architect
since
the
last
afternoon
at
robin
hill
he
was
never
free
from
the
sense
of
his
free
from
the
memory
of
his
worn
face
with
its
high
cheek
bones
and
enthusiastic
eyes
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
he
had
never
got
rid
of
the
feeling
of
that
night
when
he
heard
the
peacock
cry
at
feeling
that
bosinney
haunted
the
house
and
every
man
shape
that
he
saw
in
the
dark
evenings
walking
past
seemed
that
of
him
whom
george
had
so
appropriately
named
the
buccaneer
irene
still
met
him
he
was
certain
where
or
how
he
neither
knew
nor
asked
deterred
by
a
vague
and
secret
dread
of
too
much
knowledge
it
all
seemed
subterranean
nowadays
sometimes
when
he
questioned
his
wife
as
to
where
she
had
been
which
he
still
made
a
point
of
doing
as
every
forsyte
should
she
looked
very
strange
her
was
wonderful
but
there
were
moments
when
behind
the
mask
of
her
face
inscrutable
as
it
had
always
been
to
him
lurked
an
expression
he
had
never
been
used
to
see
there
she
had
taken
to
lunching
out
too
when
he
asked
bilson
if
her
mistress
had
been
in
to
lunch
as
often
as
not
she
would
answer
no
he
strongly
disapproved
of
her
gadding
about
by
herself
and
told
her
so
but
she
took
no
notice
there
was
something
that
angered
amazed
yet
almost
amused
him
about
the
calm
way
in
which
she
disregarded
his
wishes
it
was
really
as
if
she
were
hugging
to
herself
the
thought
of
a
triumph
over
him
he
rose
from
the
perusal
of
waterbuck
opinion
and
going
upstairs
entered
her
room
for
she
did
not
lock
her
doors
till
had
the
decency
he
found
to
save
the
feelings
of
the
servants
she
was
brushing
her
hair
and
turned
to
him
with
strange
fierceness
what
do
you
want
she
said
please
leave
my
room
he
answered
i
want
to
know
how
long
this
state
of
things
between
us
is
to
last
i
have
put
up
with
it
long
will
you
please
leave
my
room
will
you
treat
me
as
your
husband
then
i
shall
take
steps
to
make
do
he
stared
amazed
at
the
calmness
of
her
answer
her
lips
were
compressed
in
a
thin
line
her
hair
lay
in
fluffy
masses
on
her
bare
shoulders
in
all
its
strange
golden
contrast
to
her
dark
eyes
alive
with
the
emotions
of
fear
hate
contempt
and
odd
haunting
triumph
now
please
will
you
leave
my
room
he
turned
round
and
went
sulkily
out
he
knew
very
well
that
he
had
no
intention
of
taking
steps
and
he
saw
that
she
knew
that
he
was
afraid
to
it
was
a
habit
with
him
to
tell
her
the
doings
of
his
day
how
such
and
such
clients
had
called
how
he
had
arranged
a
mortgage
for
parkes
how
that
suit
of
fryer
forsyte
was
getting
on
which
arising
in
the
preternaturally
careful
disposition
of
his
property
by
his
great
uncle
nicholas
who
had
tied
it
up
so
that
no
one
could
get
at
it
at
all
seemed
likely
to
remain
a
source
of
income
for
several
solicitors
till
the
day
of
judgment
and
how
he
had
called
in
at
jobson
and
seen
a
boucher
sold
which
he
had
just
missed
buying
of
talleyrand
and
sons
in
pall
mall
he
had
an
admiration
for
boucher
watteau
and
all
that
school
it
was
a
habit
with
him
to
tell
her
all
these
matters
and
he
continued
to
do
it
even
now
talking
for
long
spells
at
dinner
as
though
by
the
volubility
of
words
he
could
conceal
from
himself
the
ache
in
his
heart
often
if
they
were
alone
he
made
an
attempt
to
kiss
her
when
she
said
he
may
have
had
some
vague
notion
that
some
night
she
would
let
him
or
perhaps
only
the
feeling
that
a
husband
ought
to
kiss
his
wife
even
if
she
hated
him
he
at
all
events
ought
not
to
put
himself
in
the
wrong
by
neglecting
this
ancient
rite
and
why
did
she
hate
him
even
now
he
could
not
altogether
believe
it
it
was
strange
to
be
hated
emotion
was
too
extreme
yet
he
hated
bosinney
that
buccaneer
that
prowling
vagabond
that
for
in
his
thoughts
soames
always
saw
him
lying
in
ah
but
he
must
be
in
very
low
water
young
burkitt
the
architect
had
seen
him
coming
out
of
a
restaurant
looking
terribly
down
in
the
mouth
during
all
the
hours
he
lay
awake
thinking
over
the
situation
which
seemed
to
have
no
she
should
suddenly
come
to
her
once
did
the
thought
of
separating
from
his
wife
seriously
enter
his
head
and
the
forsytes
what
part
did
they
play
in
this
stage
of
subterranean
tragedy
truth
to
say
little
or
none
for
they
were
at
the
sea
from
hotels
hydropathics
or
they
were
bathing
daily
laying
in
a
stock
of
ozone
to
last
them
through
the
winter
each
section
in
the
vineyard
of
its
own
choosing
grew
and
culled
and
pressed
and
bottled
the
grapes
of
a
pet
the
end
of
september
began
to
witness
their
several
returns
in
rude
health
and
small
omnibuses
with
considerable
colour
in
their
cheeks
they
arrived
daily
from
the
various
termini
the
following
morning
saw
them
back
at
their
vocations
on
the
next
sunday
timothy
was
thronged
from
lunch
till
dinner
amongst
other
gossip
too
numerous
and
interesting
to
relate
septimus
small
mentioned
that
soames
and
irene
had
not
been
away
it
remained
for
a
comparative
outsider
to
supply
the
next
evidence
of
interest
it
chanced
that
one
afternoon
late
in
september
macander
winifred
dartie
greatest
friend
taking
a
constitutional
with
young
augustus
flippard
on
her
bicycle
in
richmond
park
passed
irene
and
bosinney
walking
from
the
bracken
towards
the
sheen
gate
perhaps
the
poor
little
woman
was
thirsty
for
she
had
ridden
long
on
a
hard
dry
road
and
as
all
london
knows
to
ride
a
bicycle
and
talk
to
young
flippard
will
try
the
toughest
constitution
or
perhaps
the
sight
of
the
cool
bracken
grove
whence
two
were
coming
down
excited
her
envy
the
cool
bracken
grove
on
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
oak
boughs
for
roof
where
the
pigeons
were
raising
an
endless
wedding
hymn
and
the
autumn
humming
whispered
to
the
ears
of
lovers
in
the
fern
while
the
deer
stole
by
the
bracken
grove
of
irretrievable
delights
of
golden
minutes
in
the
long
marriage
of
heaven
and
earth
the
bracken
grove
sacred
to
stags
to
strange
fauns
leaping
around
the
silver
whiteness
of
a
nymph
at
summer
dusk
this
lady
knew
all
the
forsytes
and
having
been
at
june
home
was
not
at
a
loss
to
see
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
her
own
marriage
poor
thing
had
not
been
successful
but
having
had
the
good
sense
and
ability
to
force
her
husband
into
pronounced
error
she
herself
had
passed
through
the
necessary
divorce
proceedings
without
incurring
censure
she
was
therefore
a
judge
of
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
lived
in
one
of
those
large
buildings
where
in
small
sets
of
apartments
are
gathered
incredible
quantities
of
forsytes
whose
chief
recreation
out
of
business
hours
is
the
discussion
of
each
other
affairs
poor
little
woman
perhaps
she
was
thirsty
certainly
she
was
bored
for
flippard
was
a
wit
to
see
two
in
so
unlikely
a
spot
was
quite
a
merciful
at
the
macander
like
all
london
time
pauses
this
small
but
remarkable
woman
merits
attention
her
eye
and
shrewd
tongue
were
inscrutably
the
means
of
furthering
the
ends
of
providence
with
an
air
of
being
in
at
the
death
she
had
an
almost
distressing
power
of
taking
care
of
herself
she
had
done
more
perhaps
in
her
way
than
any
woman
about
town
to
destroy
the
sense
of
chivalry
which
still
clogs
the
wheel
of
civilization
so
smart
she
was
and
spoken
of
endearingly
as
little
macander
dressing
tightly
and
well
she
belonged
to
a
woman
club
but
was
by
no
means
the
neurotic
and
dismal
type
of
member
who
was
always
thinking
of
her
rights
she
took
her
rights
unconsciously
they
came
natural
to
her
and
she
knew
exactly
how
to
make
the
most
of
them
without
exciting
anything
but
admiration
amongst
that
great
class
to
whom
she
was
affiliated
not
precisely
perhaps
by
manner
but
by
birth
breeding
and
the
true
the
secret
gauge
a
sense
of
property
the
daughter
of
a
bedfordshire
solicitor
by
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
she
had
never
through
all
the
painful
experience
of
being
married
to
a
very
mild
painter
with
a
cranky
love
of
nature
who
had
deserted
her
for
an
actress
lost
touch
with
the
requirements
beliefs
and
inner
feeling
of
society
and
on
attaining
her
liberty
she
placed
herself
without
effort
in
the
very
van
of
forsyteism
always
in
good
spirits
and
of
information
she
was
universally
welcomed
she
excited
neither
surprise
nor
disapprobation
when
encountered
on
the
rhine
or
at
zermatt
either
alone
or
travelling
with
a
lady
and
two
gentlemen
it
was
felt
that
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
and
the
hearts
of
all
forsytes
warmed
to
that
wonderful
instinct
which
enabled
her
to
enjoy
everything
without
giving
anything
away
it
was
generally
felt
that
to
such
women
as
macander
should
we
look
for
the
perpetuation
and
increase
of
our
best
type
of
woman
she
had
never
had
any
children
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
that
she
could
not
stand
it
was
one
of
those
soft
women
with
what
men
called
about
them
and
for
soames
she
always
had
an
especial
dislike
obscurely
no
doubt
she
felt
that
if
charm
were
once
admitted
as
the
criterion
smartness
and
capability
must
go
to
the
wall
and
she
a
hatred
the
deeper
that
at
times
this
charm
seemed
to
disturb
all
subtle
seductiveness
which
she
could
not
altogether
overlook
in
irene
she
said
however
that
she
could
see
nothing
in
the
was
no
about
would
never
be
able
to
stand
up
for
could
take
advantage
of
her
that
was
could
not
see
in
fact
what
men
found
to
admire
she
was
not
really
but
in
maintaining
her
position
after
the
trying
circumstances
of
her
married
life
she
had
found
it
so
necessary
to
be
of
information
that
the
idea
of
holding
her
tongue
about
two
in
the
park
never
occurred
to
her
and
it
so
happened
that
she
was
dining
that
very
evening
at
timothy
where
she
went
sometimes
to
the
old
things
up
as
she
was
wont
to
put
it
the
same
people
were
always
asked
to
meet
her
winifred
dartie
and
her
husband
francie
because
she
belonged
to
the
artistic
circles
for
macander
was
known
to
contribute
articles
on
dress
to
ladies
kingdom
come
and
for
her
to
flirt
with
provided
they
could
be
obtained
two
of
the
hayman
boys
who
though
they
never
said
anything
were
believed
to
be
fast
and
thoroughly
intimate
with
all
that
was
latest
in
smart
society
at
minutes
past
seven
she
turned
out
the
electric
light
in
her
little
hall
and
wrapped
in
her
opera
cloak
with
the
chinchilla
collar
came
out
into
the
corridor
pausing
a
moment
to
make
sure
she
had
her
these
little
flats
were
convenient
to
be
sure
she
had
no
light
and
no
air
but
she
could
shut
it
up
whenever
she
liked
and
go
away
there
was
no
bother
with
servants
and
she
never
felt
tied
as
she
used
to
when
poor
dear
fred
was
always
about
in
his
mooney
way
she
retained
no
rancour
against
poor
dear
fred
he
was
such
a
fool
but
the
thought
of
that
actress
drew
from
her
even
now
a
little
bitter
derisive
smile
firmly
snapping
the
door
to
she
crossed
the
corridor
with
its
gloomy
walls
and
its
infinite
vista
of
brown
numbered
doors
the
lift
was
going
down
and
wrapped
to
the
ears
in
the
high
cloak
with
every
one
of
her
auburn
hairs
in
its
place
she
waited
motionless
for
it
to
stop
at
her
floor
the
iron
gates
clanked
open
she
entered
there
were
already
three
occupants
a
man
in
a
great
white
waistcoat
with
a
large
smooth
face
like
a
baby
and
two
old
ladies
in
black
with
mittened
hands
macander
smiled
at
them
she
knew
everybody
and
all
these
three
who
had
been
admirably
silent
before
began
to
talk
at
once
this
was
macander
successful
secret
she
provoked
conversation
throughout
a
descent
of
five
stories
the
conversation
continued
the
lift
boy
standing
with
his
back
turned
his
cynical
face
protruding
through
the
bars
at
the
bottom
they
separated
the
man
in
the
white
waistcoat
sentimentally
to
the
billiard
room
the
old
ladies
to
dine
and
say
to
each
other
a
dear
little
woman
such
a
rattle
and
macander
to
her
cab
when
macander
dined
at
timothy
the
conversation
although
timothy
himself
could
never
be
induced
to
be
present
took
that
wider
tone
current
among
forsytes
at
large
and
this
no
doubt
was
what
put
her
at
a
premium
there
small
and
aunt
hester
found
it
an
exhilarating
change
if
only
they
said
timothy
would
meet
her
it
was
felt
that
she
would
do
him
good
she
could
tell
you
for
instance
the
latest
story
of
sir
charles
fiste
son
at
monte
carlo
who
was
the
real
heroine
of
tynemouth
fashionable
novel
that
everyone
was
holding
up
their
hands
over
and
what
they
were
doing
in
paris
about
wearing
bloomers
she
was
so
sensible
too
knowing
all
about
that
vexed
question
whether
to
send
young
nicholas
eldest
into
the
navy
as
his
mother
wished
or
make
him
an
accountant
as
his
father
thought
would
be
safer
she
strongly
deprecated
the
navy
if
you
were
not
exceptionally
brilliant
or
exceptionally
well
connected
they
passed
you
over
so
disgracefully
and
what
was
it
after
all
to
look
forward
to
even
if
you
became
an
pittance
an
accountant
had
many
more
chances
but
let
him
be
put
with
a
good
firm
where
there
was
no
risk
at
starting
sometimes
she
would
give
them
a
tip
on
the
stock
exchange
not
that
small
or
aunt
hester
ever
took
it
they
had
indeed
no
money
to
invest
but
it
seemed
to
bring
them
into
such
exciting
touch
with
the
realities
of
life
it
was
an
event
they
would
ask
timothy
they
said
but
they
never
did
knowing
in
advance
that
it
would
upset
him
surreptitiously
however
for
weeks
after
they
would
look
in
that
paper
which
they
took
with
respect
on
account
of
its
really
fashionable
proclivities
to
see
whether
rubies
or
woollen
mackintosh
company
were
up
or
down
sometimes
they
could
not
find
the
name
of
the
company
at
all
and
they
would
wait
until
james
or
roger
or
even
swithin
came
in
and
ask
them
in
voices
trembling
with
curiosity
how
that
lime
and
speltrate
was
could
not
find
it
in
the
paper
and
roger
would
answer
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
some
trash
you
go
burning
your
your
money
in
lime
and
things
you
know
nothing
about
who
told
you
and
ascertaining
what
they
had
been
told
he
would
go
away
and
making
inquiries
in
the
city
would
perhaps
invest
some
of
his
own
money
in
the
concern
it
was
about
the
middle
of
dinner
just
in
fact
as
the
saddle
of
mutton
had
been
brought
in
by
smither
that
macander
looking
airily
round
said
oh
and
whom
do
you
think
i
passed
in
richmond
park
you
never
soames
bosinney
they
must
have
been
down
to
look
at
the
house
winifred
dartie
coughed
and
no
one
said
a
word
it
was
the
piece
of
evidence
they
had
all
unconsciously
been
waiting
for
to
do
macander
justice
she
had
been
to
switzerland
and
the
italian
lakes
with
a
party
of
three
and
had
not
heard
of
soames
rupture
with
his
architect
she
could
not
tell
therefore
the
profound
impression
her
words
would
make
upright
and
a
little
flushed
she
moved
her
small
shrewd
eyes
from
face
to
face
trying
to
gauge
the
effect
of
her
words
on
either
side
of
her
a
hayman
boy
his
lean
taciturn
hungry
face
turned
towards
his
plate
ate
his
mutton
steadily
these
two
giles
and
jesse
were
so
alike
and
so
inseparable
that
they
were
known
as
the
dromios
they
never
talked
and
seemed
always
completely
occupied
in
doing
nothing
it
was
popularly
supposed
that
they
were
cramming
for
an
important
examination
they
walked
without
hats
for
long
hours
in
the
gardens
attached
to
their
house
books
in
their
hands
a
at
their
heels
never
saying
a
word
and
smoking
all
the
time
every
morning
about
fifty
yards
apart
they
trotted
down
campden
hill
on
two
lean
hacks
with
legs
as
long
as
their
own
and
every
morning
about
an
hour
later
still
fifty
yards
apart
they
cantered
up
again
every
evening
wherever
they
had
dined
they
might
be
observed
about
ten
leaning
over
the
balustrade
of
the
alhambra
promenade
they
were
never
seen
otherwise
than
together
in
this
way
passing
their
lives
apparently
perfectly
content
inspired
by
some
dumb
stirring
within
them
of
the
feelings
of
gentlemen
they
turned
at
this
painful
moment
to
macander
and
said
in
precisely
the
same
voice
have
you
seen
the
such
was
her
surprise
at
being
thus
addressed
that
she
put
down
her
fork
and
smither
who
was
passing
promptly
removed
her
plate
macander
however
with
presence
of
mind
said
instantly
i
must
have
a
little
more
of
that
nice
but
afterwards
in
the
she
sat
down
by
small
determined
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
and
she
began
what
a
charming
woman
soames
such
a
sympathetic
temperament
soames
is
a
really
lucky
man
her
anxiety
for
information
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
that
inner
forsyte
skin
which
refuses
to
share
its
troubles
with
outsiders
septimus
small
drawing
herself
up
with
a
creak
and
rustle
of
her
whole
person
said
shivering
in
her
dignity
my
dear
it
is
a
subject
we
do
not
talk
about
chapter
in
the
park
although
with
her
infallible
instinct
small
had
said
the
very
thing
to
make
her
guest
intriguee
than
ever
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
else
she
could
truthfully
have
spoken
it
was
not
a
subject
which
the
forsytes
could
talk
about
even
among
use
the
word
soames
had
invented
to
characterize
to
himself
the
situation
it
was
yet
within
a
week
of
macander
encounter
in
richmond
park
to
all
of
timothy
from
whom
it
was
carefully
james
on
his
domestic
beat
from
the
poultry
to
park
lane
to
george
the
wild
one
on
his
daily
adventure
from
the
bow
window
at
the
haversnake
to
the
billiard
room
at
the
pottle
was
it
known
that
two
had
gone
to
extremes
george
it
was
he
who
invented
many
of
those
striking
expressions
still
current
in
fashionable
circles
voiced
the
sentiment
more
accurately
than
any
one
when
he
said
to
his
brother
eustace
that
was
it
he
expected
soames
was
about
up
it
was
felt
that
he
must
be
and
yet
what
could
be
done
he
ought
perhaps
to
take
steps
but
to
take
steps
would
be
deplorable
without
an
open
scandal
which
they
could
not
see
their
way
to
recommending
it
was
difficult
to
see
what
steps
could
be
taken
in
this
impasse
the
only
thing
was
to
say
nothing
to
soames
and
nothing
to
each
other
in
fact
to
pass
it
over
by
displaying
towards
irene
a
dignified
coldness
some
impression
might
be
made
upon
her
but
she
was
seldom
now
to
be
seen
and
there
seemed
a
slight
difficulty
in
seeking
her
out
on
purpose
to
show
her
coldness
sometimes
in
the
privacy
of
his
bedroom
james
would
reveal
to
emily
the
real
suffering
that
his
son
misfortune
caused
him
i
ca
tell
he
would
say
it
worries
me
out
of
my
life
be
a
scandal
and
that
do
him
no
good
i
sha
say
anything
to
him
there
might
be
nothing
in
it
what
do
you
think
she
very
artistic
they
tell
me
what
oh
you
a
juley
well
i
do
know
i
expect
the
worst
this
is
what
comes
of
having
no
children
i
knew
how
it
would
be
from
the
first
they
never
told
me
they
did
mean
to
have
any
tells
me
anything
on
his
knees
by
the
side
of
the
bed
his
eyes
open
and
fixed
with
worry
he
would
breathe
into
the
counterpane
clad
in
his
nightshirt
his
neck
poked
forward
his
back
rounded
he
resembled
some
long
white
bird
our
he
repeated
turning
over
and
over
again
the
thought
of
this
possible
scandal
like
old
jolyon
he
too
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
set
the
blame
of
the
tragedy
down
to
family
interference
what
business
had
that
began
to
think
of
the
stanhope
gate
branch
including
young
jolyon
and
his
daughter
as
introduce
a
person
like
this
bosinney
into
the
family
he
had
heard
george
soubriquet
buccaneer
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
young
man
was
an
architect
he
began
to
feel
that
his
brother
jolyon
to
whom
he
had
always
looked
up
and
on
whose
opinion
he
had
relied
was
not
quite
what
he
had
expected
not
having
his
eldest
brother
force
of
character
he
was
more
sad
than
angry
his
great
comfort
was
to
go
to
winifred
and
take
the
little
darties
in
his
carriage
over
to
kensington
gardens
and
there
by
the
round
pond
he
could
often
be
seen
walking
with
his
eyes
fixed
anxiously
on
little
publius
dartie
which
he
had
himself
freighted
with
a
penny
as
though
convinced
that
it
would
never
again
come
to
shore
while
little
james
delighted
to
say
was
not
a
bit
like
his
father
skipping
along
under
his
lee
would
try
to
get
him
to
bet
another
that
it
never
would
having
found
that
it
always
did
and
james
would
make
the
bet
he
always
as
many
as
three
or
four
pennies
in
the
afternoon
for
the
game
seemed
never
to
pall
on
little
always
in
paying
he
said
now
that
for
your
why
you
getting
quite
a
rich
man
the
thought
of
his
little
grandson
growing
wealth
was
a
real
pleasure
to
him
but
little
publius
knew
a
and
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
and
they
would
walk
home
across
the
park
james
figure
with
high
shoulders
and
absorbed
and
worried
face
exercising
its
tall
lean
protectorship
pathetically
unregarded
over
the
robust
of
imogen
and
little
publius
but
those
gardens
and
that
park
were
not
sacred
to
james
forsytes
and
tramps
children
and
lovers
rested
and
wandered
day
after
day
night
after
night
seeking
one
and
all
some
freedom
from
labour
from
the
reek
and
turmoil
of
the
streets
the
leaves
browned
slowly
lingering
with
the
sun
and
warmth
of
the
nights
on
saturday
october
the
sky
that
had
been
blue
all
day
deepened
after
sunset
to
the
bloom
of
purple
grapes
there
was
no
moon
and
a
clear
dark
like
some
velvety
garment
was
wrapped
around
the
trees
whose
thinned
branches
resembling
plumes
stirred
not
in
the
still
warm
air
all
london
had
poured
into
the
park
draining
the
cup
of
summer
to
its
dregs
couple
after
couple
from
every
gate
they
streamed
along
the
paths
and
over
the
burnt
grass
and
one
after
another
silently
out
of
the
lighted
spaces
stole
into
the
shelter
of
the
feathery
trees
where
blotted
against
some
trunk
or
under
the
shadow
of
shrubs
they
were
lost
to
all
but
themselves
in
the
heart
of
the
soft
darkness
to
along
the
paths
these
forerunners
formed
but
part
of
that
passionate
dusk
whence
only
a
strange
murmur
like
the
confused
beating
of
hearts
came
forth
but
when
that
murmur
reached
each
couple
in
the
their
voices
wavered
and
ceased
their
arms
enlaced
their
eyes
began
seeking
searching
probing
the
blackness
suddenly
as
though
drawn
by
invisible
hands
they
too
stepped
over
the
railing
and
silent
as
shadows
were
gone
from
the
light
the
stillness
enclosed
in
the
far
inexorable
roar
of
the
town
was
alive
with
the
myriad
passions
hopes
and
loves
of
multitudes
of
struggling
human
atoms
for
in
spite
of
the
disapproval
of
that
great
body
of
forsytes
the
municipal
whom
love
had
long
been
considered
next
to
the
sewage
question
the
gravest
danger
to
the
process
was
going
on
that
night
in
the
park
and
in
a
hundred
other
parks
without
which
the
thousand
factories
churches
shops
taxes
and
drains
of
which
they
were
custodians
were
as
arteries
without
blood
a
man
without
a
heart
the
instincts
of
of
passion
and
of
love
hiding
under
the
trees
away
from
the
trustees
of
their
remorseless
enemy
the
of
property
were
holding
a
stealthy
revel
and
soames
returning
from
he
had
been
alone
to
dine
at
walking
home
along
the
water
with
his
mind
upon
that
coming
lawsuit
had
the
blood
driven
from
his
heart
by
a
low
laugh
and
the
sound
of
kisses
he
thought
of
writing
to
the
times
the
next
morning
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
editor
to
the
condition
of
our
parks
he
did
not
however
for
he
had
a
horror
of
seeing
his
name
in
print
but
starved
as
he
was
the
whispered
sounds
in
the
stillness
the
forms
in
the
dark
acted
on
him
like
some
morbid
stimulant
he
left
the
path
along
the
water
and
stole
under
the
trees
along
the
deep
shadow
of
little
plantations
where
the
boughs
of
chestnut
trees
hung
their
great
leaves
low
and
there
was
blacker
refuge
shaping
his
course
in
circles
which
had
for
their
object
a
stealthy
inspection
of
chairs
side
by
side
against
of
enlaced
lovers
who
stirred
at
his
approach
now
he
stood
still
on
the
rise
overlooking
the
serpentine
where
in
full
black
against
the
silver
water
sat
a
couple
who
never
moved
the
woman
face
buried
on
the
man
single
form
like
a
carved
emblem
of
passion
silent
and
unashamed
and
stung
by
the
sight
soames
hurried
on
deeper
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
in
this
search
who
knows
what
he
thought
and
what
he
sought
bread
for
in
darkness
who
knows
what
he
expected
to
knowledge
of
the
human
end
of
his
private
subterranean
again
who
knew
but
that
each
dark
couple
unnamed
unnameable
might
not
be
he
and
she
but
it
could
not
be
such
knowledge
as
this
that
he
was
wife
of
soames
forsyte
sitting
in
the
park
like
a
common
wench
such
thoughts
were
inconceivable
and
from
tree
to
tree
with
his
noiseless
step
he
passed
once
he
was
sworn
at
once
the
whisper
if
only
it
could
always
be
like
this
sent
the
blood
flying
again
from
his
heart
and
he
waited
there
patient
and
dogged
for
the
two
to
move
but
it
was
only
a
poor
thin
slip
of
a
in
her
draggled
blouse
who
passed
him
clinging
to
her
lover
arm
a
hundred
other
lovers
too
whispered
that
hope
in
the
stillness
of
the
trees
a
hundred
other
lovers
clung
to
each
other
but
shaking
himself
with
sudden
disgust
soames
returned
to
the
path
and
left
that
seeking
for
he
knew
not
what
chapter
at
the
botanical
young
jolyon
whose
circumstances
were
not
those
of
a
forsyte
found
at
times
a
difficulty
in
sparing
the
money
needful
for
those
country
jaunts
and
researches
into
nature
without
having
prosecuted
which
no
watercolour
artist
ever
puts
brush
to
paper
he
was
frequently
in
fact
obliged
to
take
his
into
the
botanical
gardens
and
there
on
his
stool
in
the
shade
of
a
or
in
the
lee
of
some
plant
he
would
spend
long
hours
sketching
an
art
critic
who
had
recently
been
looking
at
his
work
had
delivered
himself
as
follows
in
a
way
your
drawings
are
very
good
tone
and
colour
in
some
of
them
certainly
quite
a
feeling
for
nature
but
you
see
they
so
scattered
you
never
get
the
public
to
look
at
them
now
if
taken
a
definite
subject
such
as
by
night
or
crystal
palace
in
the
spring
and
made
a
regular
series
the
public
would
have
known
at
once
what
they
were
looking
at
i
ca
lay
too
much
stress
upon
that
all
the
men
who
are
making
great
names
in
art
like
crum
stone
or
bleeder
are
making
them
by
avoiding
the
unexpected
by
specializing
and
putting
their
works
all
in
the
same
so
that
the
public
know
at
once
where
to
go
and
this
stands
to
reason
for
if
a
man
a
collector
he
does
want
people
to
smell
at
the
canvas
to
find
out
whom
his
pictures
are
by
he
wants
them
to
be
able
to
say
at
once
capital
forsyte
it
is
all
the
more
important
for
you
to
be
careful
to
choose
a
subject
that
they
can
lay
hold
of
on
the
spot
since
there
no
very
marked
originality
in
your
young
jolyon
standing
by
the
little
piano
where
a
bowl
of
dried
rose
leaves
the
only
produce
of
the
garden
was
deposited
on
a
bit
of
faded
damask
listened
with
his
dim
smile
turning
to
his
wife
who
was
looking
at
the
speaker
with
an
angry
expression
on
her
thin
face
he
said
you
see
dear
i
do
not
she
answered
in
her
staccato
voice
that
still
had
a
little
foreign
accent
your
style
has
the
critic
looked
at
her
smiled
deferentially
and
said
no
more
like
everyone
else
he
knew
their
history
the
words
bore
good
fruit
with
young
jolyon
they
were
contrary
to
all
that
he
believed
in
to
all
that
he
theoretically
held
good
in
his
art
but
some
strange
deep
instinct
moved
him
against
his
will
to
turn
them
to
profit
he
discovered
therefore
one
morning
that
an
idea
had
come
to
him
for
making
a
series
of
watercolour
drawings
of
london
how
the
idea
had
arisen
he
could
not
tell
and
it
was
not
till
the
following
year
when
he
had
completed
and
sold
them
at
a
very
fair
price
that
in
one
of
his
impersonal
moods
he
found
himself
able
to
recollect
the
art
critic
and
to
discover
in
his
own
achievement
another
proof
that
he
was
a
forsyte
he
decided
to
commence
with
the
botanical
gardens
where
he
had
already
made
so
many
studies
and
chose
the
little
artificial
pond
sprinkled
now
with
an
autumn
shower
of
red
and
yellow
leaves
for
though
the
gardeners
longed
to
sweep
them
off
they
could
not
reach
them
with
their
brooms
the
rest
of
the
gardens
they
swept
bare
enough
removing
every
morning
nature
rain
of
leaves
piling
them
in
heaps
whence
from
slow
fires
rose
the
sweet
acrid
smoke
that
like
the
cuckoo
note
for
spring
the
scent
of
lime
trees
for
the
summer
is
the
true
emblem
of
the
fall
the
gardeners
tidy
souls
could
not
abide
the
gold
and
green
and
russet
pattern
on
the
grass
the
gravel
paths
must
lie
unstained
ordered
methodical
without
knowledge
of
the
realities
of
life
nor
of
that
slow
and
beautiful
decay
which
flings
crowns
underfoot
to
star
the
earth
with
fallen
glories
whence
as
the
cycle
rolls
will
leap
again
wild
spring
thus
each
leaf
that
fell
was
marked
from
the
moment
when
it
fluttered
a
and
dropped
slow
turning
from
its
twig
but
on
that
little
pond
the
leaves
floated
in
peace
and
praised
heaven
with
their
hues
the
sunlight
haunting
over
them
and
so
young
jolyon
found
them
coming
there
one
morning
in
the
middle
of
october
he
was
disconcerted
to
find
a
bench
about
twenty
paces
from
his
stand
occupied
for
he
had
a
proper
horror
of
anyone
seeing
him
at
work
a
lady
in
a
velvet
jacket
was
sitting
there
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
a
flowering
laurel
however
stood
between
and
taking
shelter
behind
this
young
jolyon
prepared
his
easel
his
preparations
were
leisurely
he
caught
as
every
true
artist
should
at
anything
that
might
delay
for
a
moment
the
effort
of
his
work
and
he
found
himself
looking
furtively
at
this
unknown
dame
like
his
father
before
him
he
had
an
eye
for
a
face
this
face
was
charming
he
saw
a
rounded
chin
nestling
in
a
cream
ruffle
a
delicate
face
with
large
dark
eyes
and
soft
lips
a
black
hat
concealed
the
hair
her
figure
was
lightly
poised
against
the
back
of
the
bench
her
knees
were
crossed
the
tip
of
a
shoe
emerged
beneath
her
skirt
there
was
something
indeed
inexpressibly
dainty
about
the
person
of
this
lady
but
young
jolyon
attention
was
chiefly
riveted
by
the
look
on
her
face
which
reminded
him
of
his
wife
it
was
as
though
its
owner
had
come
into
contact
with
forces
too
strong
for
her
it
troubled
him
arousing
vague
feelings
of
attraction
and
chivalry
who
was
she
and
what
doing
there
alone
two
young
gentlemen
of
that
peculiar
breed
at
once
forward
and
shy
found
in
the
regent
park
came
by
on
their
way
to
lawn
tennis
and
he
noted
with
disapproval
their
furtive
stares
of
admiration
a
loitering
gardener
halted
to
do
something
unnecessary
to
a
clump
of
pampas
grass
he
too
wanted
an
excuse
for
peeping
a
gentleman
old
and
by
his
hat
a
professor
of
horticulture
passed
three
times
to
scrutinize
her
long
and
stealthily
a
queer
expression
about
his
lips
with
all
these
men
young
jolyon
felt
the
same
vague
irritation
she
looked
at
none
of
them
yet
was
he
certain
that
every
man
who
passed
would
look
at
her
like
that
her
face
was
not
the
face
of
a
sorceress
who
in
every
look
holds
out
to
men
the
offer
of
pleasure
it
had
none
of
the
beauty
so
highly
prized
among
the
first
forsytes
of
the
land
neither
was
it
of
that
type
no
less
adorable
associated
with
the
box
of
chocolate
it
was
not
of
the
spiritually
passionate
or
passionately
spiritual
order
peculiar
to
and
modern
poetry
nor
did
it
seem
to
promise
to
the
playwright
material
for
the
production
of
the
interesting
and
neurasthenic
figure
who
commits
suicide
in
the
last
act
in
shape
and
colouring
in
its
soft
persuasive
passivity
its
sensuous
purity
this
woman
face
reminded
him
of
titian
love
a
reproduction
of
which
hung
over
the
sideboard
in
his
and
her
attraction
seemed
to
be
in
this
soft
passivity
in
the
feeling
she
gave
that
to
pressure
she
must
yield
for
what
or
whom
was
she
waiting
in
the
silence
with
the
trees
dropping
here
and
there
a
leaf
and
the
thrushes
strutting
close
on
grass
touched
with
the
sparkle
of
the
autumn
rime
then
her
charming
face
grew
eager
and
glancing
round
with
almost
a
lover
jealousy
young
jolyon
saw
bosinney
striding
across
the
grass
curiously
he
watched
the
meeting
the
look
in
their
eyes
the
long
clasp
of
their
hands
they
sat
down
close
together
linked
for
all
their
outward
discretion
he
heard
the
rapid
murmur
of
their
talk
but
what
they
said
he
could
not
catch
he
had
rowed
in
the
galley
himself
he
knew
the
long
hours
of
waiting
and
the
lean
minutes
of
a
meeting
the
tortures
of
suspense
that
haunt
the
unhallowed
lover
it
required
however
but
a
glance
at
their
two
faces
to
see
that
this
was
none
of
those
affairs
of
a
season
that
distract
men
and
women
about
town
none
of
those
sudden
appetites
that
wake
up
ravening
and
are
surfeited
and
asleep
again
in
six
weeks
this
was
the
real
thing
this
was
what
had
happened
to
himself
out
of
this
anything
might
come
bosinney
was
pleading
and
she
so
quiet
so
soft
yet
immovable
in
her
passivity
sat
looking
over
the
grass
was
he
the
man
to
carry
her
off
that
tender
passive
being
who
would
never
stir
a
step
for
herself
who
had
given
him
all
herself
and
would
die
for
him
but
perhaps
would
never
run
away
with
him
it
seemed
to
young
jolyon
that
he
could
hear
her
saying
but
darling
it
would
ruin
you
for
he
himself
had
experienced
to
the
full
the
gnawing
fear
at
the
bottom
of
each
woman
heart
that
she
is
a
drag
on
the
man
she
loves
and
he
peeped
at
them
no
more
but
their
soft
rapid
talk
came
to
his
ears
with
the
stuttering
song
of
some
bird
who
seemed
trying
to
remember
the
notes
of
spring
and
gradually
their
talk
ceased
long
silence
followed
where
does
soames
come
in
young
jolyon
thought
think
she
is
concerned
about
the
sin
of
deceiving
her
husband
little
they
know
of
women
she
eating
after
her
revenge
and
heaven
help
he
take
his
he
heard
the
swish
of
silk
and
spying
round
the
laurel
saw
them
walking
away
their
hands
stealthily
joined
at
the
end
of
july
old
jolyon
had
taken
his
to
the
mountains
and
on
that
visit
the
last
they
ever
paid
june
recovered
to
a
great
extent
her
health
and
spirits
in
the
hotels
filled
with
british
old
jolyon
could
not
bear
a
of
germans
as
he
called
all
was
looked
upon
with
only
of
that
and
evidently
wealthy
old
forsyte
she
did
not
mix
freely

formed
some
friendships
and
notably
one
in
the
rhone
valley
with
a
french
girl
who
was
dying
of
consumption
determining
at
once
that
her
friend
should
not
die
she
forgot
in
the
institution
of
a
campaign
against
death
much
of
her
own
trouble
old
jolyon
watched
the
new
intimacy
with
relief
and
disapproval
for
this
additional
proof
that
her
life
was
to
be
passed
amongst
ducks
worried
him
would
she
never
make
a
friendship
or
take
an
interest
in
something
that
would
be
of
real
benefit
to
her
up
with
a
parcel
of
foreigners
he
called
it
he
often
however
brought
home
grapes
or
roses
and
presented
them
to
with
an
ingratiating
twinkle
towards
the
end
of
september
in
spite
of
june
disapproval
mademoiselle
vigor
breathed
her
last
in
the
little
hotel
at
luc
to
which
they
had
moved
her
and
june
took
her
defeat
so
deeply
to
heart
that
old
jolyon
carried
her
away
to
paris
here
in
contemplation
of
the
de
milo
and
the
she
shook
off
her
depression
and
when
towards
the
middle
of
october
they
returned
to
town
her
grandfather
believed
that
he
had
effected
a
cure
no
sooner
however
had
they
established
themselves
in
stanhope
gate
than
he
perceived
to
his
dismay
a
return
of
her
old
absorbed
and
brooding
manner
she
would
sit
staring
in
front
of
her
her
chin
on
her
hand
like
a
little
norse
spirit
grim
and
intent
while
all
around
in
the
electric
light
then
just
installed
shone
the
great
brocaded
up
to
the
frieze
full
of
furniture
from
baple
and
pullbred
and
in
the
huge
gilt
mirror
were
reflected
those
dresden
china
groups
of
young
men
in
tight
knee
breeches
at
the
feet
of
ladies
nursing
on
their
laps
pet
lambs
which
old
jolyon
had
bought
when
he
was
a
bachelor
and
thought
so
highly
of
in
these
days
of
degenerate
taste
he
was
a
man
of
most
open
mind
who
more
than
any
forsyte
of
them
all
had
moved
with
the
times
but
he
could
never
forget
that
he
had
bought
these
groups
at
jobson
and
given
a
lot
of
money
for
them
he
often
said
to
june
with
a
sort
of
disillusioned
contempt
you
do
care
about
them
they
not
the
gimcrack
things
you
and
your
friends
like
but
they
cost
me
seventy
pounds
he
was
not
a
man
who
allowed
his
taste
to
be
warped
when
he
knew
for
solid
reasons
that
it
was
sound
one
of
the
first
things
that
june
did
on
getting
home
was
to
go
round
to
timothy
she
persuaded
herself
that
it
was
her
duty
to
call
there
and
cheer
him
with
an
account
of
all
her
travels
but
in
reality
she
went
because
she
knew
of
no
other
place
where
by
some
random
speech
or
roundabout
question
she
could
glean
news
of
bosinney
they
received
her
most
cordially
and
how
was
her
dear
grandfather
he
had
not
been
to
see
them
since
may
her
uncle
timothy
was
very
poorly
he
had
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
the
in
his
bedroom
the
stupid
man
had
let
the
soot
down
the
chimney
it
had
quite
upset
her
uncle
june
sat
there
a
long
time
dreading
yet
passionately
hoping
that
they
would
speak
of
bosinney
but
paralyzed
by
unaccountable
discretion
septimus
small
let
fall
no
word
neither
did
she
question
june
about
him
in
desperation
the
girl
asked
at
last
whether
soames
and
irene
were
in
had
not
yet
been
to
see
anyone
it
was
aunt
hester
who
replied
oh
yes
they
were
in
town
they
had
not
been
away
at
all
there
was
some
little
difficulty
about
the
house
she
believed
june
had
heard
no
doubt
she
had
better
ask
her
aunt
juley
june
turned
to
small
who
sat
upright
in
her
chair
her
hands
clasped
her
face
covered
with
innumerable
pouts
in
answer
to
the
girl
look
she
maintained
a
strange
silence
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
to
ask
june
whether
she
had
worn
up
in
those
high
hotels
where
it
must
be
so
cold
of
a
night
june
answered
that
she
had
not
she
hated
the
stuffy
things
and
rose
to
leave
small
infallibly
chosen
silence
was
far
more
ominous
to
her
than
anything
that
could
have
been
said
before
half
an
hour
was
over
she
had
dragged
the
truth
from
baynes
in
lowndes
square
that
soames
was
bringing
an
action
against
bosinney
over
the
decoration
of
the
house
instead
of
disturbing
her
the
news
had
a
strangely
calming
effect
as
though
she
saw
in
the
prospect
of
this
struggle
new
hope
for
herself
she
learnt
that
the
case
was
expected
to
come
on
in
about
a
month
and
there
seemed
little
or
no
prospect
of
bosinney
success
and
whatever
he
do
i
ca
think
said
baynes
it
very
dreadful
for
him
you
got
no
very
hard
up
and
we
ca
help
him
i
sure
i
told
the
wo
lend
if
you
have
no
security
and
he
has
at
her
embonpoint
had
increased
of
late
she
was
in
the
full
swing
of
autumn
organization
her
literally
strewn
with
the
menus
of
charity
functions
she
looked
meaningly
at
june
with
her
round
eyes
of
the
sudden
flush
that
rose
on
the
girl
intent
young
must
have
seen
spring
up
before
her
a
great
sudden
sweetness
of
her
smile
often
came
back
to
lady
baynes
in
after
years
baynes
was
knighted
when
he
built
that
public
museum
of
art
which
has
given
so
much
employment
to
officials
and
so
little
pleasure
to
those
working
classes
for
whom
it
was
designed
the
memory
of
that
change
vivid
and
touching
like
the
breaking
open
of
a
flower
or
the
first
sun
after
long
winter
the
memory
too
of
all
that
came
after
often
intruded
itself
unaccountably
inopportunely
on
lady
baynes
when
her
mind
was
set
upon
the
most
important
things
this
was
the
very
afternoon
of
the
day
that
young
jolyon
witnessed
the
meeting
in
the
botanical
gardens
and
on
this
day
too
old
jolyon
paid
a
visit
to
his
solicitors
forsyte
bustard
and
forsyte
in
the
poultry
soames
was
not
in
he
had
gone
down
to
somerset
house
bustard
was
buried
up
to
the
hilt
in
papers
and
that
inaccessible
apartment
where
he
was
judiciously
placed
in
order
that
he
might
do
as
much
work
as
possible
but
james
was
in
the
front
office
biting
a
finger
and
lugubriously
turning
over
the
pleadings
in
forsyte
bosinney
this
sound
lawyer
had
only
a
sort
of
luxurious
dread
of
the
point
enough
to
set
up
a
pleasurable
feeling
of
fuss
for
his
good
practical
sense
told
him
that
if
he
himself
were
on
the
bench
he
would
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
but
he
was
afraid
that
this
bosinney
would
go
bankrupt
and
soames
would
have
to
find
the
money
after
all
and
costs
into
the
bargain
and
behind
this
tangible
dread
there
was
always
that
intangible
trouble
lurking
in
the
background
intricate
dim
scandalous
like
a
bad
dream
and
of
which
this
action
was
but
an
outward
and
visible
sign
he
raised
his
head
as
old
jolyon
came
in
and
muttered
how
are
you
jolyon
have
seen
you
for
an
age
you
been
to
switzerland
they
tell
me
this
young
bosinney
he
got
himself
into
a
mess
i
knew
how
it
would
be
he
held
out
the
papers
regarding
his
elder
brother
with
nervous
gloom
old
jolyon
read
them
in
silence
and
while
he
read
them
james
looked
at
the
floor
biting
his
fingers
the
while
old
jolyon
pitched
them
down
at
last
and
they
fell
with
a
thump
amongst
a
mass
of
affidavits
in
buncombe
deceased
one
of
the
many
branches
of
that
parent
and
profitable
tree
v
forsyte
i
do
know
what
soames
is
about
he
said
to
make
a
fuss
over
a
few
hundred
pounds
i
thought
he
was
a
man
of
james
long
upper
lip
twitched
angrily
he
could
not
bear
his
son
to
be
attacked
in
such
a
spot
it
not
the
money
he
began
but
meeting
his
brother
glance
direct
shrewd
judicial
he
stopped
there
was
a
silence
i
come
in
for
my
will
said
old
jolyon
at
last
tugging
at
his
moustache
james
curiosity
was
roused
at
once
perhaps
nothing
in
this
life
was
more
stimulating
to
him
than
a
will
it
was
the
supreme
deal
with
property
the
final
inventory
of
a
man
belongings
the
last
word
on
what
he
was
worth
he
sounded
the
bell
bring
in
jolyon
will
he
said
to
an
anxious
clerk
you
going
to
make
some
alterations
and
through
his
mind
there
flashed
the
thought
am
i
worth
as
much
as
he
old
jolyon
put
the
will
in
his
breast
pocket
and
james
twisted
his
long
legs
regretfully
you
made
some
nice
purchases
lately
they
tell
me
he
said
i
do
know
where
you
get
your
information
from
answered
old
jolyon
sharply
when
this
action
coming
on
next
month
i
ca
tell
what
you
got
in
your
minds
you
must
manage
your
own
affairs
but
if
you
take
my
advice
you
settle
it
out
of
court
with
a
cold
handshake
he
was
gone
james
his
fixed
eye
corkscrewing
round
some
secret
anxious
image
began
again
to
bite
his
finger
old
jolyon
took
his
will
to
the
offices
of
the
new
colliery
company
and
sat
down
in
the
empty
board
room
to
read
it
through
he
answered
hemmings
so
tartly
when
the
latter
seeing
his
chairman
seated
there
entered
with
the
new
superintendent
first
report
that
the
secretary
withdrew
with
regretful
dignity
and
sending
for
the
transfer
clerk
blew
him
up
till
the
poor
youth
knew
not
where
to
look
it
was
he
would
have
him
know
for
a
whippersnapper
of
a
young
fellow
like
him
to
come
down
to
that
office
and
think
that
he
was
god
almighty
he
had
been
head
of
that
office
for
more
years
than
a
boy
like
him
could
count
and
if
he
thought
that
when
he
had
finished
all
his
work
he
could
sit
there
doing
nothing
he
did
not
know
him
hemmings
and
so
forth
on
the
other
side
of
the
green
baize
door
old
jolyon
sat
at
the
long
board
table
his
thick
tortoiseshell
perched
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
his
gold
pencil
moving
down
the
clauses
of
his
will
it
was
a
simple
affair
for
there
were
none
of
those
vexatious
little
legacies
and
donations
to
charities
which
fritter
away
a
possessions
and
damage
the
majestic
effect
of
that
little
paragraph
in
the
morning
papers
accorded
to
forsytes
who
die
with
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
simple
affair
just
a
bequest
to
his
son
of
twenty
thousand
and
to
the
residue
of
my
property
of
whatsoever
kind
whether
realty
or
personalty
or
partaking
of
the
nature
of
trust
to
pay
the
proceeds
rents
annual
produce

or
interest
thereof
and
thereon
to
my
said
june
forsyte
or
her
assigns
during
her
life
to
be
for
her
sole
use
and
benefit
and
without

and
from
and
after
her
death
or
decease
upon
trust
to
convey
assign

or
make
over
the
said
lands
hereditaments

and

or
such

shall
then
stand
for

represent
the

such

or

whether
one
or
more
for
such
intents
purposes
and
uses
and
generally
in
such
manner
way
and
form
in
all
respects
as
the
said
june
forsyte
notwithstanding
coverture
shall
by
her
last
will
and
testament
or
any
writing
or
writings
in
the
nature
of
a

or

disposition
to

duly
made

and
published
direct
appoint
or
make

and
dispose
of
the
same
and
in
default
etc
provided
always
and
so
on
in
seven
folios
of
brief
and
simple
phraseology
the
will
had
been
drawn
by
james
in
his
palmy
days
he
had
foreseen
almost
every
contingency
old
jolyon
sat
a
long
time
reading
this
will
at
last
he
took
half
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
rack
and
made
a
prolonged
pencil
note
then
buttoning
up
the
will
he
caused
a
cab
to
be
called
and
drove
to
the
offices
of
paramor
and
herring
in
lincoln
inn
fields
jack
herring
was
dead
but
his
nephew
was
still
in
the
firm
and
old
jolyon
was
closeted
with
him
for
half
an
hour
he
had
kept
the
hansom
and
on
coming
out
gave
the
driver
the
wistaria
avenue
he
felt
a
strange
slow
satisfaction
as
though
he
had
scored
a
victory
over
james
and
the
man
of
property
they
should
not
poke
their
noses
into
his
affairs
any
more
he
had
just
cancelled
their
trusteeships
of
his
will
he
would
take
the
whole
of
his
business
out
of
their
hands
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
young
herring
and
he
would
move
the
business
of
his
companies
too
if
that
young
soames
were
such
a
man
of
property
he
would
never
miss
a
thousand
a
year
or
so
and
under
his
great
white
moustache
old
jolyon
grimly
smiled
he
felt
that
what
he
was
doing
was
in
the
nature
of
retributive
justice
richly
deserved
slowly
surely
with
the
secret
inner
process
that
works
the
destruction
of
an
old
tree
the
poison
of
the
wounds
to
his
happiness
his
will
his
pride
had
corroded
the
comely
edifice
of
his
philosophy
life
had
worn
him
down
on
one
side
till
like
that
family
of
which
he
was
the
head
he
had
lost
balance
to
him
borne
northwards
towards
his
son
house
the
thought
of
the
new
disposition
of
property
which
he
had
just
set
in
motion
appeared
vaguely
in
the
light
of
a
stroke
of
punishment
levelled
at
that
family
and
that
society
of
which
james
and
his
son
seemed
to
him
the
representatives
he
had
made
a
restitution
to
young
jolyon
and
restitution
to
young
jolyon
satisfied
his
secret
craving
for
against
time
sorrow
and
interference
against
all
that
incalculable
sum
of
disapproval
that
had
been
bestowed
by
the
world
for
fifteen
years
on
his
only
son
it
presented
itself
as
the
one
possible
way
of
asserting
once
more
the
domination
of
his
will
of
forcing
james
and
soames
and
the
family
and
all
those
hidden
masses
of
great
stream
rolling
against
the
single
dam
of
his
recognise
once
and
for
all
that
he
would
be
master
it
was
sweet
to
think
that
at
last
he
was
going
to
make
the
boy
a
richer
man
by
far
than
that
son
of
james
that
of
property
and
it
was
sweet
to
give
to
jo
for
he
loved
his
son
neither
young
jolyon
nor
his
wife
were
in
young
jolyon
indeed
was
not
back
from
the
botanical
but
the
little
maid
told
him
that
she
expected
the
master
at
any
moment
he
always
at
to
tea
sir
to
play
with
the
old
jolyon
said
he
would
wait
and
sat
down
patiently
enough
in
the
faded
shabby
drawing
room
where
now
that
the
summer
chintzes
were
removed
the
old
chairs
and
sofas
revealed
all
their
threadbare
deficiencies
he
longed
to
send
for
the
children
to
have
them
there
beside
him
their
supple
bodies
against
his
knees
to
hear
jolly
hallo
gran
and
see
his
rush
and
feel
holly
soft
little
hand
stealing
up
against
his
cheek
but
he
would
not
there
was
solemnity
in
what
he
had
come
to
do
and
until
it
was
over
he
would
not
play
he
amused
himself
by
thinking
how
with
two
strokes
of
his
pen
he
was
going
to
restore
the
look
of
caste
so
conspicuously
absent
from
everything
in
that
little
house
how
he
could
fill
these
rooms
or
others
in
some
larger
mansion
with
triumphs
of
art
from
baple
and
pullbred
how
he
could
send
little
jolly
to
harrow
and
oxford
he
no
longer
had
faith
in
eton
and
cambridge
for
his
son
had
been
there
how
he
could
procure
little
holly
the
best
musical
instruction
the
child
had
a
remarkable
aptitude
as
these
visions
crowded
before
him
causing
emotion
to
swell
his
heart
he
rose
and
stood
at
the
window
looking
down
into
the
little
walled
strip
of
garden
where
the
bare
of
leaves
before
its
time
stood
with
gaunt
branches
in
the
mist
of
the
autumn
afternoon
the
dog
balthasar
his
tail
curled
tightly
over
a
piebald
furry
back
was
walking
at
the
farther
end
sniffing
at
the
plants
and
at
intervals
placing
his
leg
for
support
against
the
wall
and
old
jolyon
mused
what
pleasure
was
there
left
but
to
give
it
was
pleasant
to
give
when
you
could
find
one
who
would
be
thankful
for
what
you
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
there
was
no
such
satisfaction
to
be
had
out
of
giving
to
those
who
did
not
belong
to
you
to
those
who
had
no
claim
on
you
such
giving
as
that
was
a
betrayal
of
the
individualistic
convictions
and
actions
of
his
life
of
all
his
enterprise
his
labour
and
his
moderation
of
the
great
and
proud
fact
that
like
tens
of
thousands
of
forsytes
before
him
tens
of
thousands
in
the
present
tens
of
thousands
in
the
future
he
had
always
made
his
own
and
held
his
own
in
the
world
and
while
he
stood
there
looking
down
on
the
foliage
of
the
laurels
the
the
progress
of
the
dog
balthasar
all
the
suffering
of
the
fifteen
years
during
which
he
had
been
baulked
of
legitimate
enjoyment
mingled
its
gall
with
the
sweetness
of
the
approaching
moment
young
jolyon
came
at
last
pleased
with
his
work
and
fresh
from
long
hours
in
the
open
air
on
hearing
that
his
father
was
in
the
drawing
room
he
inquired
hurriedly
whether
forsyte
was
at
home
and
being
informed
that
she
was
not
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
then
putting
his
painting
materials
carefully
in
the
little
out
of
sight
he
went
in
with
characteristic
decision
old
jolyon
came
at
once
to
the
point
been
altering
my
arrangements
jo
he
said
you
can
cut
your
coat
a
bit
longer
in
the
settling
a
thousand
a
year
on
you
at
once
june
will
have
fifty
thousand
at
my
death
and
you
the
rest
that
dog
of
yours
is
spoiling
the
garden
i
should
keep
a
dog
if
i
were
you
the
dog
balthasar
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
lawn
was
examining
his
tail
young
jolyon
looked
at
the
animal
but
saw
him
dimly
for
his
eyes
were
misty
yours
wo
come
short
of
a
hundred
thousand
my
boy
said
old
jolyon
i
thought
you
better
know
i
have
much
longer
to
live
at
my
age
i
sha
allude
to
it
again
how
your
wife
her
my
young
jolyon
put
his
hand
on
his
father
shoulder
and
as
neither
spoke
the
episode
closed
having
seen
his
father
into
a
hansom
young
jolyon
came
back
to
the
and
stood
where
old
jolyon
had
stood
looking
down
on
the
little
garden
he
tried
to
realize
all
that
this
meant
to
him
and
forsyte
that
he
was
vistas
of
property
were
opened
out
in
his
brain
the
years
of
half
rations
through
which
he
had
passed
had
not
sapped
his
natural
instincts
in
extremely
practical
form
he
thought
of
travel
of
his
wife
costume
the
children
education
a
pony
for
jolly
a
thousand
things
but
in
the
midst
of
all
he
thought
too
of
bosinney
and
his
mistress
and
the
broken
song
of
the
thrush
which
which
the
old
poignant
suffering
passionate
wonderful
past
that
no
money
could
buy
that
nothing
could
restore
in
all
its
burning
come
back
before
him
when
his
wife
came
in
he
went
straight
up
to
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
for
a
long
time
he
stood
without
speaking
his
eyes
closed
pressing
her
to
him
while
she
looked
at
him
with
a
wondering
adoring
doubting
look
in
her
eyes
chapter
into
the
inferno
the
morning
after
a
certain
night
on
which
soames
at
last
asserted
his
rights
and
acted
like
a
man
he
breakfasted
alone
he
breakfasted
by
gaslight
the
fog
of
late
november
wrapping
the
town
as
in
some
monstrous
blanket
till
the
trees
of
the
square
even
were
barely
visible
from
the
window
he
ate
steadily
but
at
times
a
sensation
as
though
he
could
not
swallow
attacked
him
had
he
been
right
to
yield
to
his
overmastering
hunger
of
the
night
before
and
break
down
the
resistance
which
he
had
suffered
now
too
long
from
this
woman
who
was
his
lawful
and
solemnly
constituted
helpmate
he
was
strangely
haunted
by
the
recollection
of
her
face
from
before
which
to
soothe
her
he
had
tried
to
pull
her
her
terrible
smothered
sobbing
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
heard
and
still
seemed
to
hear
and
he
was
still
haunted
by
the
odd
intolerable
feeling
of
remorse
and
shame
he
had
felt
as
he
stood
looking
at
her
by
the
flame
of
the
single
candle
before
silently
slinking
away
and
somehow
now
that
he
had
acted
like
this
he
was
surprised
at
himself
two
nights
before
at
winifred
dartie
he
had
taken
macander
into
dinner
she
had
said
to
him
looking
in
his
face
with
her
sharp
greenish
eyes
and
so
your
wife
is
a
great
friend
of
that
bosinney
not
deigning
to
ask
what
she
meant
he
had
brooded
over
her
words
they
had
roused
in
him
a
fierce
jealousy
which
with
the
peculiar
perversion
of
this
instinct
had
turned
to
fiercer
desire
without
the
incentive
of
macander
words
he
might
never
have
done
what
he
had
done
without
their
incentive
and
the
accident
of
finding
his
wife
door
for
once
unlocked
which
had
enabled
him
to
steal
upon
her
asleep
slumber
had
removed
his
doubts
but
the
morning
brought
them
again
one
thought
comforted
him
no
one
would
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
she
would
speak
about
and
indeed
when
the
vehicle
of
his
daily
business
life
which
needed
so
imperatively
the
grease
of
clear
and
practical
thought
started
rolling
once
more
with
the
reading
of
his
letters
those
doubts
began
to
assume
less
extravagant
importance
at
the
back
of
his
mind
the
incident
was
really
not
of
great
moment
women
made
a
fuss
about
it
in
books
but
in
the
cool
judgment
of
men
of
men
of
the
world
of
such
as
he
recollected
often
received
praise
in
the
divorce
court
he
had
but
done
his
best
to
sustain
the
sanctity
of
marriage
to
prevent
her
from
abandoning
her
duty
possibly
if
she
were
still
seeing
bosinney
from
no
he
did
not
regret
it
now
that
the
first
step
towards
reconciliation
had
been
taken
the
rest
would
be
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
his
nerve
had
been
shaken
the
sound
of
smothered
sobbing
was
in
his
ears
again
he
could
not
get
rid
of
it
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
went
out
into
the
fog
having
to
go
into
the
city
he
took
the
underground
railway
from
sloane
square
station
in
his
corner
of
the
compartment
filled
with
city
men
the
smothered
sobbing
still
haunted
him
so
he
opened
the
times
with
the
rich
crackle
that
drowns
all
lesser
sounds
and
barricaded
behind
it
set
himself
steadily
to
con
the
news
he
read
that
a
recorder
had
charged
a
grand
jury
on
the
previous
day
with
a
more
than
usually
long
list
of
offences
he
read
of
three
murders
five
manslaughters
seven
arsons
and
as
many
as
eleven
surprisingly
high
addition
to
many
less
conspicuous
crimes
to
be
tried
during
a
coming
sessions
and
from
one
piece
of
news
he
went
on
to
another
keeping
the
paper
well
before
his
face
and
still
inseparable
from
his
reading
was
the
memory
of
face
and
the
sounds
from
her
broken
heart
the
day
was
a
busy
one
including
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
affairs
of
his
practice
a
visit
to
his
brokers
grin
and
grinning
to
give
them
instructions
to
sell
his
shares
in
the
new
colliery
whose
business
he
suspected
rather
than
knew
was
stagnating
this
enterprise
afterwards
slowly
declined
and
was
ultimately
sold
for
a
song
to
an
american
syndicate
and
a
long
conference
at
waterbuck
chambers
attended
by
boulter
by
fiske
the
junior
counsel
and
waterbuck
himself
the
case
of
forsyte
bosinney
was
expected
to
be
reached
on
the
morrow
before
justice
bentham
justice
bentham
a
man
of
rather
than
too
great
legal
knowledge
was
considered
to
be
about
the
best
man
they
could
have
to
try
the
action
he
was
a
judge
waterbuck
in
pleasing
conjunction
with
an
almost
rude
neglect
of
boulter
and
fiske
paid
to
soames
a
good
deal
of
attention
by
instinct
or
the
sounder
evidence
of
rumour
feeling
him
to
be
a
man
of
property
he
held
with
remarkable
consistency
to
the
opinion
he
had
already
expressed
in
writing
that
the
issue
would
depend
to
a
great
extent
on
the
evidence
given
at
the
trial
and
in
a
few
well
directed
remarks
he
advised
soames
not
to
be
too
careful
in
giving
that
evidence
a
little
bluffness
forsyte
he
said
a
little
bluffness
and
after
he
had
spoken
he
laughed
firmly
closed
his
lips
tight
and
scratched
his
head
just
below
where
he
had
pushed
his
wig
back
for
all
the
world
like
the
for
whom
he
loved
to
be
taken
he
was
considered
perhaps
the
leading
man
in
breach
of
promise
cases
soames
used
the
underground
again
in
going
home
the
fog
was
worse
than
ever
at
sloane
square
station
through
the
still
thick
blur
men
groped
in
and
out
women
very
few
grasped
their
reticules
to
their
bosoms
and
handkerchiefs
to
their
mouths
crowned
with
the
weird
excrescence
of
the
driver
haloed
by
a
vague
glow
of
that
seemed
to
drown
in
vapour
before
it
reached
the
pavement
cabs
loomed
ever
and
again
and
discharged
citizens
bolting
like
rabbits
to
their
burrows
and
these
shadowy
figures
wrapped
each
in
his
own
little
shroud
of
fog
took
no
notice
of
each
other
in
the
great
warren
each
rabbit
for
himself
especially
those
clothed
in
the
more
expensive
fur
who
afraid
of
carriages
on
foggy
days
are
driven
underground
one
figure
however
not
far
from
soames
waited
at
the
station
door
some
buccaneer
or
lover
of
whom
each
forsyte
thought
devil
looks
as
if
he
were
having
a
bad
time
their
kind
hearts
beat
a
stroke
faster
for
that
poor
waiting
anxious
lover
in
the
fog
but
they
hurried
by
well
knowing
that
they
had
neither
time
nor
money
to
spare
for
any
suffering
but
their
own
only
a
policeman
patrolling
slowly
and
at
intervals
took
an
interest
in
that
waiting
figure
the
brim
of
whose
slouch
hat
half
hid
a
face
reddened
by
the
cold
all
thin
and
haggard
over
which
a
hand
stole
now
and
again
to
smooth
away
anxiety
or
renew
the
resolution
that
kept
him
waiting
there
but
the
waiting
lover
if
lover
he
were
was
used
to
policemen
scrutiny
or
too
absorbed
in
his
anxiety
for
he
never
flinched
a
hardened
case
accustomed
to
long
trysts
to
anxiety
and
fog
and
cold
if
only
his
mistress
came
at
last
foolish
lover
fogs
last
until
the
spring
there
is
also
snow
and
rain
no
comfort
anywhere
gnawing
fear
if
you
bring
her
out
gnawing
fear
if
you
bid
her
stay
at
home
serve
him
right
he
should
arrange
his
affairs
better
so
any
respectable
forsyte
yet
if
that
sounder
citizen
could
have
listened
at
the
waiting
lover
heart
out
there
in
the
fog
and
the
cold
he
would
have
said
again
yes
poor
devil
he
having
a
bad
time
soames
got
into
his
cab
and
with
the
glass
down
crept
along
sloane
street
and
so
along
the
brompton
road
and
home
he
reached
his
house
at
five
his
wife
was
not
in
she
had
gone
out
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
out
at
such
a
time
of
night
into
this
terrible
fog
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
he
sat
by
the
fire
with
the
door
open
disturbed
to
the
soul
trying
to
read
the
evening
paper
a
book
was
no
daily
papers
alone
was
any
narcotic
to
such
worry
as
his
from
the
customary
events
recorded
in
the
journal
he
drew
some
comfort
of
an
indisposition
of
a
statesman
that
chronic
sufferer
of
an
army
in
a
read
them
all
they
helped
him
a
by
the
greatest
of
all
doctors
our
natural
taste
it
was
nearly
seven
when
he
heard
her
come
in
the
incident
of
the
night
before
had
long
lost
its
importance
under
stress
of
anxiety
at
her
strange
sortie
into
the
fog
but
now
that
irene
was
home
the
memory
of
her
sobbing
came
back
to
him
and
he
felt
nervous
at
the
thought
of
facing
her
she
was
already
on
the
stairs
her
grey
fur
coat
hung
to
her
knees
its
high
collar
almost
hid
her
face
she
wore
a
thick
veil
she
neither
turned
to
look
at
him
nor
spoke
no
ghost
or
stranger
could
have
passed
more
silently
bilson
came
to
lay
dinner
and
told
him
that
forsyte
was
not
coming
down
she
was
having
the
soup
in
her
room
for
once
soames
did
not
it
was
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
sat
down
to
dinner
with
soiled
cuffs
and
not
even
noticing
them
he
brooded
long
over
his
wine
he
sent
bilson
to
light
a
fire
in
his
and
presently
went
up
there
himself
turning
on
the
gas
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
though
amongst
these
treasures
the
backs
of
which
confronted
him
in
stacks
around
the
little
room
he
had
found
at
length
his
peace
of
mind
he
went
straight
up
to
the
greatest
treasure
of
them
all
an
undoubted
turner
and
carrying
it
to
the
easel
turned
its
face
to
the
light
there
had
been
a
movement
in
turners
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
to
part
with
it
he
stood
for
a
long
time
his
pale
face
poked
forward
above
his
collar
looking
at
the
picture
as
though
he
were
adding
it
up
a
wistful
expression
came
into
his
eyes
he
found
perhaps
that
it
came
to
too
little
he
took
it
down
from
the
easel
to
put
it
back
against
the
wall
but
in
crossing
the
room
stopped
for
he
seemed
to
hear
sobbing
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
had
been
bothering
him
in
the
morning
and
soon
after
putting
the
high
guard
before
the
blazing
fire
he
stole
downstairs
fresh
for
the
morrow
was
his
thought
it
was
long
before
he
went
to
sleep
it
is
now
to
george
forsyte
that
the
mind
must
turn
for
light
on
the
events
of
that
afternoon
the
wittiest
and
most
sportsmanlike
of
the
forsytes
had
passed
the
day
reading
a
novel
in
the
paternal
mansion
at
princes
gardens
since
a
recent
crisis
in
his
financial
affairs
he
had
been
kept
on
parole
by
roger
and
compelled
to
reside
home
towards
five
he
went
out
and
took
train
at
south
kensington
station
for
everyone
went
underground
his
intention
was
to
dine
and
pass
the
evening
playing
billiards
at
the
red
unique
hostel
neither
club
hotel
nor
good
gilt
restaurant
he
got
out
at
charing
cross
choosing
it
in
preference
to
his
more
usual
james
park
that
he
might
reach
jermyn
street
by
better
lighted
ways
on
the
platform
his
in
combination
with
a
composed
and
fashionable
appearance
george
had
sharp
eyes
and
was
always
on
the
for
fillips
to
his
sardonic
eyes
were
attracted
by
a
man
who
leaping
from
a
compartment
staggered
rather
than
walked
towards
the
exit
ho
my
bird
said
george
to
himself
it
the
buccaneer
and
he
put
his
big
figure
on
the
trail
nothing
afforded
him
greater
amusement
than
a
drunken
man
bosinney
who
wore
a
slouch
hat
stopped
in
front
of
him
spun
around
and
rushed
back
towards
the
carriage
he
had
just
left
he
was
too
late
a
porter
caught
him
by
the
coat
the
train
was
already
moving
on
george
practised
glance
caught
sight
of
the
face
of
a
lady
clad
in
a
grey
fur
coat
at
the
carriage
window
it
was
george
felt
that
this
was
interesting
and
now
he
followed
bosinney
more
closely
than
the
stairs
past
the
ticket
collector
into
the
street
in
that
progress
however
his
feelings
underwent
a
change
no
longer
merely
curious
and
amused
he
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow
he
was
shadowing
buccaneer
was
not
drunk
but
seemed
to
be
acting
under
the
stress
of
violent
emotion
he
was
talking
to
himself
and
all
that
george
could
catch
were
the
words
oh
god
nor
did
he
appear
to
know
what
he
was
doing
or
where
going
but
stared
hesitated
moved
like
a
man
out
of
his
mind
and
from
being
merely
a
joker
in
search
of
amusement
george
felt
that
he
must
see
the
poor
chap
through
he
had
the
the
knock
and
he
wondered
what
on
earth
soames
had
been
saying
what
on
earth
she
had
been
telling
him
in
the
railway
carriage
she
had
looked
bad
enough
herself
it
made
george
sorry
to
think
of
her
travelling
on
with
her
trouble
all
alone
he
followed
close
behind
bosinney
burly
figure
saying
nothing
dodging
shadowed
him
out
into
the
fog
there
was
something
here
beyond
a
jest
he
kept
his
head
admirably
in
spite
of
some
excitement
for
in
addition
to
compassion
the
instincts
of
the
chase
were
roused
within
him
bosinney
walked
right
out
into
the
vast
muffled
blackness
where
a
man
could
not
see
six
paces
before
him
where
all
around
voices
or
whistles
mocked
the
sense
of
direction
and
sudden
shapes
came
rolling
slow
upon
them
and
now
and
then
a
light
showed
like
a
dim
island
in
an
infinite
dark
sea
and
fast
into
this
perilous
gulf
of
night
walked
bosinney
and
fast
after
him
walked
george
if
the
fellow
meant
to
put
his
under
a
he
would
stop
it
if
he
could
across
the
street
and
back
the
hunted
creature
strode
not
groping
as
other
men
were
groping
in
that
gloom
but
driven
forward
as
though
the
faithful
george
behind
wielded
a
knout
and
this
chase
after
a
haunted
man
began
to
have
for
george
the
strangest
fascination
but
it
was
now
that
the
affair
developed
in
a
way
which
ever
afterwards
caused
it
to
remain
green
in
his
mind
brought
to
a
in
the
fog
he
heard
words
which
threw
a
sudden
light
on
these
proceedings
what
soames
had
said
to
bosinney
in
the
train
was
now
no
longer
dark
george
understood
from
those
mutterings
that
soames
had
exercised
his
rights
over
an
estranged
and
unwilling
wife
in
the
supreme
act
of
property
his
fancy
wandered
in
the
fields
of
this
situation
it
impressed
him
he
guessed
something
of
the
anguish
the
sexual
confusion
and
horror
in
bosinney
heart
and
he
thought
it
a
bit
thick
i
do
wonder
the
poor
fellow
is
he
had
run
his
quarry
to
earth
on
a
bench
under
one
of
the
lions
in
trafalgar
square
a
monster
sphynx
astray
like
themselves
in
that
gulf
of
darkness
here
rigid
and
silent
sat
bosinney
and
george
in
whose
patience
was
a
touch
of
strange
brotherliness
took
his
stand
behind
he
was
not
lacking
in
a
certain
sense
of
did
not
permit
him
to
intrude
upon
this
tragedy
and
he
waited
quiet
as
the
lion
above
his
fur
collar
hitched
above
his
ears
concealing
the
fleshy
redness
of
his
cheeks
concealing
all
but
his
eyes
with
their
sardonic
compassionate
stare
and
men
kept
passing
back
from
business
on
the
way
to
their
whose
figures
shrouded
in
cocoons
of
fog
came
into
view
like
spectres
and
like
spectres
vanished
then
even
in
his
compassion
george
quilpish
humour
broke
forth
in
a
sudden
longing
to
pluck
these
spectres
by
the
sleeve
and
say
hi
you
johnnies
you
do
often
see
a
show
like
this
here
a
poor
devil
whose
mistress
has
just
been
telling
him
a
pretty
little
story
of
her
husband
walk
up
walk
up
he
taken
the
knock
you
in
fancy
he
saw
them
gaping
round
the
tortured
lover
and
grinned
as
he
thought
of
some
respectable
spectre
enabled
by
the
state
of
his
own
affections
to
catch
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
within
bosinney
he
fancied
he
could
see
his
mouth
getting
wider
and
wider
and
the
fog
going
down
and
down
for
in
george
was
all
that
contempt
of
the
of
the
married
to
the
wild
and
sportsmanlike
spirits
in
its
ranks
but
he
began
to
be
bored
waiting
was
not
what
he
had
bargained
for
all
he
thought
poor
chap
will
get
over
it
not
the
first
time
such
a
thing
has
happened
in
this
little
city
but
now
his
quarry
again
began
muttering
words
of
violent
hate
and
anger
and
following
a
sudden
impulse
george
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
bosinney
spun
round
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
george
could
have
stood
it
well
enough
in
the
light
of
the
gas
lamps
in
the
light
of
that
everyday
world
of
which
he
was
so
hardy
a
connoisseur
but
in
this
fog
where
all
was
gloomy
and
unreal
where
nothing
had
that
value
associated
by
forsytes
with
earth
he
was
a
victim
to
strange
qualms
and
as
he
tried
to
stare
back
into
the
eyes
of
this
maniac
he
thought
i
see
a
bobby
i
hand
him
over
he
not
fit
to
be
at
large
but
waiting
for
no
answer
bosinney
strode
off
into
the
fog
and
george
followed
keeping
perhaps
a
little
further
off
yet
more
than
ever
set
on
tracking
him
down
ca
go
on
long
like
this
he
thought
god
own
miracle
he
not
been
run
over
already
he
brooded
no
more
on
policemen
a
sportsman
sacred
fire
alive
again
within
him
into
a
denser
gloom
than
ever
bosinney
held
on
at
a
furious
pace
but
his
pursuer
perceived
more
method
in
his
was
clearly
making
his
way
westwards
really
going
for
soames
thought
george
the
idea
was
attractive
it
would
be
a
sporting
end
to
such
a
chase
he
had
always
disliked
his
cousin
the
shaft
of
a
passing
cab
brushed
against
his
shoulder
and
made
him
leap
aside
he
did
not
intend
to
be
killed
for
the
buccaneer
or
anyone
yet
with
hereditary
tenacity
he
stuck
to
the
trail
through
vapour
that
blotted
out
everything
but
the
shadow
of
the
hunted
man
and
the
dim
moon
of
the
nearest
lamp
then
suddenly
with
the
instinct
of
a
george
knew
himself
to
be
in
piccadilly
here
he
could
find
his
way
blindfold
and
freed
from
the
strain
of
geographical
uncertainty
his
mind
returned
to
bosinney
trouble
down
the
long
avenue
of
his
experience
bursting
as
it
were
through
a
smirch
of
doubtful
amours
there
stalked
to
him
a
memory
of
his
youth
a
memory
poignant
still
that
brought
the
scent
of
hay
the
gleam
of
moonlight
a
summer
magic
into
the
reek
and
blackness
of
this
london
memory
of
a
night
when
in
the
darkest
shadow
of
a
lawn
he
had
overheard
from
a
woman
lips
that
he
was
not
her
sole
possessor
and
for
a
moment
george
walked
no
longer
in
black
piccadilly
but
lay
again
with
hell
in
his
heart
and
his
face
to
the
dewy
grass
in
the
long
shadow
of
poplars
that
hid
the
moon
a
longing
seized
him
to
throw
his
arm
round
the
buccaneer
and
say
come
old
boy
time
cures
all
let
go
and
drink
it
off
but
a
voice
yelled
at
him
and
he
started
back
a
cab
rolled
out
of
blackness
and
into
blackness
disappeared
and
suddenly
george
perceived
that
he
had
lost
bosinney
he
ran
forward
and
back
felt
his
heart
clutched
by
a
sickening
fear
the
dark
fear
which
lives
in
the
wings
of
the
fog
perspiration
started
out
on
his
brow
he
stood
quite
still
listening
with
all
his
might
and
then
as
he
confided
to
dartie
the
same
evening
in
the
course
of
a
game
of
billiards
at
the
red
pottle
i
lost
dartie
twirled
complacently
at
his
dark
moustache
he
had
just
put
together
a
neat
break
of
at
a
and
who
was
she
he
asked
george
looked
slowly
at
the
of
the
world
fattish
sallow
face
and
a
little
grim
smile
lurked
about
the
curves
of
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
no
my
fine
fellow
he
thought
not
going
to
tell
you
for
though
he
mixed
with
dartie
a
good
deal
he
thought
him
a
bit
of
a
cad
oh
some
little
or
other
he
said
and
chalked
his
cue
a
exclaimed
used
a
more
figurative
expression
i
made
sure
it
was
our
friend
soa
did
you
said
george
curtly
then
damme
you
made
an
he
missed
his
shot
he
was
careful
not
to
allude
to
the
subject
again
till
towards
eleven
having
in
his
poetic
phraseology
upon
the
drink
when
it
was
yellow
he
drew
aside
the
blind
and
gazed
out
into
the
street
the
murky
blackness
of
the
fog
was
but
faintly
broken
by
the
lamps
of
the
pottle
and
no
shape
of
mortal
man
or
thing
was
in
sight
i
ca
help
thinking
of
that
poor
buccaneer
he
said
he
may
be
wandering
out
there
now
in
that
fog
if
he
not
a
corpse
he
added
with
strange
dejection
corpse
said
dartie
in
whom
the
recollection
of
his
defeat
at
richmond
flared
up
he
all
right
ten
to
one
if
he
was
tight
george
turned
on
him
looking
really
formidable
with
a
sort
of
savage
gloom
on
his
big
face
dry
up
he
said
do
i
tell
you
he
the
knock
chapter
trial
in
the
morning
of
his
case
which
was
second
in
the
list
soames
was
again
obliged
to
start
without
seeing
irene
and
it
was
just
as
well
for
he
had
not
as
yet
made
up
his
mind
what
attitude
to
adopt
towards
her
he
had
been
requested
to
be
in
court
by
ten
to
provide
against
the
event
of
the
first
action
a
breach
of
promise
collapsing
which
however
it
did
not
both
sides
showing
a
courage
that
afforded
waterbuck
an
opportunity
for
improving
his
already
great
reputation
in
this
class
of
case
he
was
opposed
by
ram
the
other
celebrated
breach
of
promise
man
it
was
a
battle
of
giants
the
court
delivered
judgment
just
before
the
luncheon
interval
the
jury
left
the
box
for
good
and
soames
went
out
to
get
something
to
eat
he
met
james
standing
at
the
little
like
a
pelican
in
the
wilderness
of
the
galleries
bent
over
a
sandwich
with
a
glass
of
sherry
before
him
the
spacious
emptiness
of
the
great
central
hall
over
which
father
and
son
brooded
as
they
stood
together
was
marred
now
and
then
for
a
fleeting
moment
by
barristers
in
wig
and
gown
hurriedly
bolting
across
by
an
occasional
old
lady
or
man
looking
up
in
a
frightened
way
and
by
two
persons
bolder
than
their
generation
seated
in
an
embrasure
arguing
the
sound
of
their
voices
arose
together
with
a
scent
as
of
neglected
wells
which
mingling
with
the
odour
of
the
galleries
combined
to
form
the
savour
like
nothing
but
the
emanation
of
a
refined
cheese
so
indissolubly
connected
with
the
administration
of
british
justice
it
was
not
long
before
james
addressed
his
son
when
your
case
coming
on
i
suppose
it
be
on
directly
i
wonder
if
this
bosinney
say
anything
i
should
think
he
have
to
he
go
bankrupt
if
it
goes
against
he
took
a
large
bite
at
his
sandwich
and
a
mouthful
of
sherry
your
mother
he
said
wants
you
and
irene
to
come
and
dine
a
chill
smile
played
round
soames
lips
he
looked
back
at
his
father
anyone
who
had
seen
the
look
cold
and
furtive
thus
interchanged
might
have
been
pardoned
for
not
appreciating
the
real
understanding
between
them
james
finished
his
sherry
at
a
draught
how
much
he
asked
on
returning
to
the
court
soames
took
at
once
his
rightful
seat
on
the
front
bench
beside
his
solicitor
he
ascertained
where
his
father
was
seated
with
a
glance
so
sidelong
as
to
commit
nobody
james
sitting
back
with
his
hands
clasped
over
the
handle
of
his
umbrella
was
brooding
on
the
end
of
the
bench
immediately
behind
counsel
whence
he
could
get
away
at
once
when
the
case
was
over
he
considered
bosinney
conduct
in
every
way
outrageous
but
he
did
not
wish
to
run
up
against
him
feeling
that
the
meeting
would
be
awkward
next
to
the
divorce
court
this
court
was
perhaps
the
favourite
emporium
of
justice
libel
breach
of
promise
and
other
commercial
actions
being
frequently
decided
there
quite
a
sprinkling
of
persons
unconnected
with
the
law
occupied
the
back
benches
and
the
hat
of
a
woman
or
two
could
be
seen
in
the
gallery
the
two
rows
of
seats
immediately
in
front
of
james
were
gradually
filled
by
barristers
in
wigs
who
sat
down
to
make
pencil
notes
chat
and
attend
to
their
teeth
but
his
interest
was
soon
diverted
from
these
lesser
lights
of
justice
by
the
entrance
of
waterbuck
with
the
wings
of
his
silk
gown
rustling
and
his
red
capable
face
supported
by
two
short
brown
whiskers
the
famous
looked
as
james
freely
admitted
the
very
picture
of
a
man
who
could
heckle
a
witness
for
all
his
experience
it
so
happened
that
he
had
never
seen
waterbuck
before
and
like
many
forsytes
in
the
lower
branch
of
the
profession
he
had
an
extreme
admiration
for
a
good
the
long
lugubrious
folds
in
his
cheeks
relaxed
somewhat
after
seeing
him
especially
as
he
now
perceived
that
soames
alone
was
represented
by
silk
waterbuck
had
barely
screwed
round
on
his
elbow
to
chat
with
his
junior
before
justice
bentham
himself
thin
rather
man
with
a
little
stoop
under
his
snowy
wig
like
all
the
rest
of
the
court
waterbuck
rose
and
remained
on
his
feet
until
the
judge
was
seated
james
rose
but
slightly
he
was
already
comfortable
and
had
no
opinion
of
bentham
having
sat
next
but
one
to
him
at
dinner
twice
at
the
bumley
tomms
bumley
tomm
was
rather
a
poor
thing
though
he
had
been
so
successful
james
himself
had
given
him
his
first
brief
he
was
excited
too
for
he
had
just
found
out
that
bosinney
was
not
in
court
what
he
mean
by
that
he
kept
on
thinking
the
case
having
been
called
on
waterbuck
pushing
back
his
papers
hitched
his
gown
on
his
shoulder
and
with
a
look
around
him
like
a
man
who
is
going
to
bat
arose
and
addressed
the
court
the
facts
he
said
were
not
in
dispute
and
all
that
his
lordship
would
be
asked
was
to
interpret
the
correspondence
which
had
taken
place
between
his
client
and
the
defendant
an
architect
with
reference
to
the
decoration
of
a
house
he
would
however
submit
that
this
correspondence
could
only
mean
one
very
plain
thing
after
briefly
reciting
the
history
of
the
house
at
robin
hill
which
he
described
as
a
mansion
and
the
actual
facts
of
expenditure
he
went
on
as
follows
my
client
soames
forsyte
is
a
gentleman
a
man
of
property
who
would
be
the
last
to
dispute
any
legitimate
claim
that
might
be
made
against
him
but
he
has
met
with
such
treatment
from
his
architect
in
the
matter
of
this
house
over
which
he
has
as
your
lordship
has
heard
already
spent
some
twelve
thousand
pounds
a
sum
considerably
in
advance
of
the
amount
he
had
originally
contemplated
that
as
a
matter
of
this
i
can
not
too
strongly
a
matter
of
principle
and
in
the
interests
of
others
he
has
felt
himself
compelled
to
bring
this
action
the
point
put
forward
in
defence
by
the
architect
i
will
suggest
to
your
lordship
is
not
worthy
of
a
moment
serious
he
then
read
the
correspondence
his
client
a
man
of
recognised
position
was
prepared
to
go
into
the
box
and
to
swear
that
he
never
did
authorize
that
it
was
never
in
his
mind
to
authorize
the
expenditure
of
any
money
beyond
the
extreme
limit
of
twelve
thousand
and
fifty
pounds
which
he
had
clearly
fixed
and
not
further
to
waste
the
time
of
the
court
he
would
at
once
call
forsyte
soames
then
went
into
the
box
his
whole
appearance
was
striking
in
its
composure
his
face
just
supercilious
enough
pale
and
with
a
little
line
between
the
eyes
and
compressed
lips
his
dress
in
unostentatious
order
one
hand
neatly
gloved
the
other
bare
he
answered
the
questions
put
to
him
in
a
somewhat
low
but
distinct
voice
his
evidence
under
savoured
of
taciturnity
had
he
not
used
the
expression
a
free
hand
no
come
come
the
expression
he
had
used
was
free
hand
in
the
terms
of
this
correspondence
would
you
tell
the
court
that
that
was
english
yes
what
do
you
say
it
means
what
it
says
are
you
prepared
to
deny
that
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
you
are
not
an
irishman
are
you
a
man
and
yet
you
persist
in
that
statement
throughout
this
and
much
more
which
turned
again
and
again
around
the
point
james
sat
with
his
hand
behind
his
ear
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
son
he
was
proud
of
him
he
could
not
but
feel
that
in
similar
circumstances
he
himself
would
have
been
tempted
to
enlarge
his
replies
but
his
instinct
told
him
that
this
taciturnity
was
the
very
thing
he
sighed
with
relief
however
when
soames
slowly
turning
and
without
any
change
of
expression
descended
from
the
box
when
it
came
to
the
turn
of
bosinney
counsel
to
address
the
judge
james
redoubled
his
attention
and
he
searched
the
court
again
and
again
to
see
if
bosinney
were
not
somewhere
concealed
young
chankery
began
nervously
he
was
placed
by
bosinney
absence
in
an
awkward
position
he
therefore
did
his
best
to
turn
that
absence
to
account
he
could
not
but
his
client
had
met
with
an
accident
he
had
fully
expected
him
there
to
give
evidence
they
had
sent
round
that
morning
both
to
bosinney
office
and
to
his
rooms
though
he
knew
they
were
one
and
the
same
he
thought
it
was
as
well
not
to
say
so
but
it
was
not
known
where
he
was
and
this
he
considered
to
be
ominous
knowing
how
anxious
bosinney
had
been
to
give
his
evidence
he
had
not
however
been
instructed
to
apply
for
an
adjournment
and
in
default
of
such
instruction
he
conceived
it
his
duty
to
go
on
the
plea
on
which
he
somewhat
confidently
relied
and
which
his
client
had
he
not
unfortunately
been
prevented
in
some
way
from
attending
would
have
supported
by
his
evidence
was
that
such
an
expression
as
a
could
not
be
limited
fettered
and
rendered
unmeaning
by
any
verbiage
which
might
follow
it
he
would
go
further
and
say
that
the
correspondence
showed
that
whatever
he
might
have
said
in
his
evidence
forsyte
had
in
fact
never
contemplated
repudiating
liability
on
any
of
the
work
ordered
or
executed
by
his
architect
the
defendant
had
certainly
never
contemplated
such
a
contingency
or
as
was
demonstrated
by
his
letters
he
would
never
have
proceeded
with
the
work
of
extreme
delicacy
carried
out
with
great
care
and
efficiency
to
meet
and
satisfy
the
fastidious
taste
of
a
connoisseur
a
rich
man
a
man
of
property
he
felt
strongly
on
this
point
and
feeling
strongly
he
used
perhaps
rather
strong
words
when
he
said
that
this
action
was
of
a
most
unjustifiable
unexpected
character
if
his
lordship
had
had
the
opportunity
that
he
himself
had
made
it
his
duty
to
take
to
go
over
this
very
fine
house
and
see
the
great
delicacy
and
beauty
of
the
decorations
executed
by
his
artist
in
his
most
honourable
felt
convinced
that
not
for
one
moment
would
his
lordship
tolerate
this
he
would
use
no
stronger
word
than
daring
attempt
to
evade
legitimate
responsibility
taking
the
text
of
soames
letters
he
lightly
touched
on
the
blasted
cement
company
limited
it
is
doubtful
he
said
what
that
authority
has
decided
in
any
case
i
would
submit
that
it
is
just
as
much
in
my
favour
as
in
my
he
then
argued
the
point
closely
with
all
due
deference
he
submitted
that
expression
nullified
itself
his
client
not
being
a
rich
man
the
matter
was
a
serious
one
for
him
he
was
a
very
talented
architect
whose
professional
reputation
was
undoubtedly
somewhat
at
stake
he
concluded
with
a
perhaps
too
personal
appeal
to
the
judge
as
a
lover
of
the
arts
to
show
himself
the
protector
of
artists
from
what
was
said
too
iron
hand
of
capital
what
he
said
will
be
the
position
of
the
artistic
professions
if
men
of
property
like
this
forsyte
refuse
and
are
allowed
to
refuse
to
carry
out
the
obligations
of
the
commissions
which
they
have
he
would
now
call
his
client
in
case
he
should
at
the
last
moment
have
found
himself
able
to
be
present
the
name
philip
baynes
bosinney
was
called
three
times
by
the
ushers
and
the
sound
of
the
calling
echoed
with
strange
melancholy
throughout
the
court
and
galleries
the
crying
of
this
name
to
which
no
answer
was
returned
had
upon
james
a
curious
effect
it
was
like
calling
for
your
lost
dog
about
the
streets
and
the
creepy
feeling
that
it
gave
him
of
a
man
missing
grated
on
his
sense
of
comfort
and
his
cosiness
though
he
could
not
have
said
why
it
made
him
feel
uneasy
he
looked
now
at
the
quarter
to
three
it
would
be
all
over
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
where
could
the
young
fellow
be
it
was
only
when
justice
bentham
delivered
judgment
that
he
got
over
the
turn
he
had
received
behind
the
wooden
erection
by
which
he
was
fenced
from
more
ordinary
mortals
the
learned
judge
leaned
forward
the
electric
light
just
turned
on
above
his
head
fell
on
his
face
and
mellowed
it
to
an
orange
hue
beneath
the
snowy
crown
of
his
wig
the
amplitude
of
his
robes
grew
before
the
eye
his
whole
figure
facing
the
comparative
dusk
of
the
court
radiated
like
some
majestic
and
sacred
body
he
cleared
his
throat
took
a
sip
of
water
broke
the
nib
of
a
quill
against
the
desk
and
folding
his
bony
hands
before
him
began
to
james
he
suddenly
loomed
much
larger
than
he
had
ever
thought
bentham
would
loom
it
was
the
majesty
of
the
law
and
a
person
endowed
with
a
nature
far
less
than
that
of
james
might
have
been
excused
for
failing
to
pierce
this
halo
and
disinter
therefrom
the
somewhat
ordinary
forsyte
who
walked
and
talked
in
life
under
the
name
of
sir
walter
bentham
he
delivered
judgment
in
the
following
words
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
on
may
last
the
defendant
wrote
to
the
plaintiff
requesting
to
be
allowed
to
withdraw
from
his
professional
position
in
regard
to
the
decoration
of
the
house
unless
he
were
given
free
hand
the
plaintiff
on
may
wrote
back
as
follows
giving
you
in
accordance
with
your
request
this
free
hand
i
wish
you
to
clearly
understand
that
the
total
cost
of
the
house
as
handed
over
to
me
completely
decorated
inclusive
of
your
fee
as
arranged
between
us
must
not
exceed
twelve
thousand
pounds
to
this
letter
the
defendant
replied
on
may
you
think
that
in
such
a
delicate
matter
as
decoration
i
can
bind
myself
to
the
exact
pound
i
am
afraid
you
are
mistaken
on
may
the
plaintiff
wrote
as
follows
did
not
mean
to
say
that
if
you
should
exceed
the
sum
named
in
my
letter
to
you
by
ten
or
twenty
or
even
fifty
pounds
there
would
be
any
difficulty
between
us
you
have
a
free
hand
in
the
terms
of
this
correspondence
and
i
hope
you
will
see
your
way
to
completing
the
decorations
on
may
the
defendant
replied
thus
shortly
well
in
completing
these
decorations
the
defendant
incurred
liabilities
and
expenses
which
brought
the
total
cost
of
this
house
up
to
the
sum
of
twelve
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
all
of
which
expenditure
has
been
defrayed
by
the
plaintiff
this
action
has
been
brought
by
the
plaintiff
to
recover
from
the
defendant
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
expended
by
him
in
excess
of
a
sum
of
twelve
thousand
and
fifty
pounds
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
to
have
been
fixed
by
this
correspondence
as
the
maximum
sum
that
the
defendant
had
authority
to
expend
the
question
for
me
to
decide
is
whether
or
no
the
defendant
is
liable
to
refund
to
the
plaintiff
this
sum
in
my
judgment
he
is
so
liable
what
in
effect
the
plaintiff
has
said
is
this
give
you
a
free
hand
to
complete
these
decorations
provided
that
you
keep
within
a
total
cost
to
me
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
if
you
exceed
that
sum
by
as
much
as
fifty
pounds
i
will
not
hold
you
responsible
beyond
that
point
you
are
no
agent
of
mine
and
i
shall
repudiate
liability
it
is
not
quite
clear
to
me
whether
had
the
plaintiff
in
fact
repudiated
liability
under
his
agent
contracts
he
would
under
all
the
circumstances
have
been
successful
in
so
doing
but
he
has
not
adopted
this
course
he
has
accepted
liability
and
fallen
back
upon
his
rights
against
the
defendant
under
the
terms
of
the
latter
engagement
in
my
judgment
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
recover
this
sum
from
the
defendant
it
has
been
sought
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
to
show
that
no
limit
of
expenditure
was
fixed
or
intended
to
be
fixed
by
this
correspondence
if
this
were
so
i
can
find
no
reason
for
the
plaintiff
importation
into
the
correspondence
of
the
figures
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
and
subsequently
of
fifty
pounds
the
defendant
contention
would
render
these
figures
meaningless
it
is
manifest
to
me
that
by
his
letter
of
may
he
assented
to
a
very
clear
proposition
by
the
terms
of
which
he
must
be
held
to
be
bound
for
these
reasons
there
will
be
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
for
the
amount
claimed
with
james
sighed
and
stooping
picked
up
his
umbrella
which
had
fallen
with
a
rattle
at
the
words
into
this
correspondence
untangling
his
legs
he
rapidly
left
the
court
without
waiting
for
his
son
he
snapped
up
a
hansom
cab
it
was
a
clear
grey
afternoon
and
drove
straight
to
timothy
where
he
found
swithin
and
to
him
septimus
small
and
aunt
hester
he
recounted
the
whole
proceedings
eating
two
muffins
not
altogether
in
the
intervals
of
speech
soames
did
very
well
he
ended
he
got
his
head
screwed
on
the
right
way
this
wo
please
jolyon
it
a
bad
business
for
that
young
bosinney
he
go
bankrupt
i
should
wonder
and
then
after
a
long
pause
during
which
he
had
stared
disquietly
into
the
fire
he
added
he
was
why
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
the
figure
of
a
man
with
the
ruddy
brown
face
of
robust
health
was
seen
in
the
back
the
forefinger
of
his
upraised
hand
was
outlined
against
the
black
of
his
frock
coat
he
spoke
in
a
grudging
voice
well
james
he
said
i
ca
stop
and
turning
round
he
walked
out
it
was
timothy
james
rose
from
his
chair
there
he
said
there
i
knew
there
was
something
wro
he
checked
himself
and
was
silent
staring
before
him
as
though
he
had
seen
a
portent
chapter
breaks
the
news
in
leaving
the
court
soames
did
not
go
straight
home
he
felt
disinclined
for
the
city
and
drawn
by
need
for
sympathy
in
his
triumph
he
too
made
his
way
but
slowly
and
on
foot
to
timothy
in
the
bayswater
road
his
father
had
just
left
small
and
aunt
hester
in
possession
of
the
whole
story
greeted
him
warmly
they
were
sure
he
was
hungry
after
all
that
evidence
smither
should
toast
him
some
more
muffins
his
dear
father
had
eaten
them
all
he
must
put
his
legs
up
on
the
sofa
and
he
must
have
a
glass
of
prune
brandy
too
it
was
so
strengthening
swithin
was
still
present
having
lingered
later
than
his
wont
for
he
felt
in
want
of
exercise
on
hearing
this
suggestion
he
a
pretty
pass
young
men
were
coming
to
his
own
liver
was
out
of
order
and
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
anyone
else
drinking
prune
brandy
he
went
away
almost
immediately
saying
to
soames
and
how
your
wife
you
tell
her
from
me
that
if
she
dull
and
likes
to
come
and
dine
with
me
quietly
i
give
her
such
a
bottle
of
champagne
as
she
does
get
every
staring
down
from
his
height
on
soames
he
contracted
his
thick
puffy
yellow
hand
as
though
squeezing
within
it
all
this
small
fry
and
throwing
out
his
chest
he
waddled
slowly
away
small
and
aunt
hester
were
left
horrified
swithin
was
so
droll
they
themselves
were
longing
to
ask
soames
how
irene
would
take
the
result
yet
knew
that
they
must
not
he
would
perhaps
say
something
of
his
own
accord
to
throw
some
light
on
this
the
present
burning
question
in
their
lives
the
question
that
from
necessity
of
silence
tortured
them
almost
beyond
bearing
for
even
timothy
had
now
been
told
and
the
effect
on
his
health
was
little
short
of
alarming
and
what
too
would
june
do
this
also
was
a
most
exciting
if
dangerous
speculation
they
had
never
forgotten
old
jolyon
visit
since
when
he
had
not
once
been
to
see
them
they
had
never
forgotten
the
feeling
it
gave
all
who
were
present
that
the
family
was
no
longer
what
it
had
the
family
was
breaking
up
but
soames
gave
them
no
help
sitting
with
his
knees
crossed
talking
of
the
barbizon
school
of
painters
whom
he
had
just
discovered
these
were
the
coming
men
he
said
he
should
not
wonder
if
a
lot
of
money
were
made
over
them
he
had
his
eye
on
two
pictures
by
a
man
called
corot
charming
things
if
he
could
get
them
at
a
reasonable
price
he
was
going
to
buy
would
he
thought
fetch
a
big
price
some
day
interested
as
they
could
not
but
be
neither
septimus
small
nor
aunt
hester
could
entirely
acquiesce
in
being
thus
put
off
it
was
then
soames
was
so
clever
that
they
were
sure
he
would
do
something
with
those
pictures
if
anybody
could
but
what
was
his
plan
now
that
he
had
won
his
case
was
he
going
to
leave
london
at
once
and
live
in
the
country
or
what
was
he
going
to
do
soames
answered
that
he
did
not
know
he
thought
they
should
be
moving
soon
he
rose
and
kissed
his
aunts
no
sooner
had
aunt
juley
received
this
emblem
of
departure
than
a
change
came
over
her
as
though
she
were
being
visited
by
dreadful
courage
every
little
roll
of
flesh
on
her
face
seemed
trying
to
escape
from
an
invisible
confining
mask
she
rose
to
the
full
extent
of
her
more
than
medium
height
and
said
it
has
been
on
my
mind
a
long
time
dear
and
if
nobody
else
will
tell
you
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
aunt
hester
interrupted
her
mind
julia
you
do
it
she
on
your
own
responsibility
small
went
on
as
though
she
had
not
heard
i
think
you
ought
to
know
dear
that
macander
saw
irene
walking
in
richmond
park
with
aunt
hester
who
had
also
risen
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
turned
her
face
away
really
juley
was
should
not
do
such
things
when
hester
was
in
the
room
and
breathless
with
anticipation
she
waited
for
what
soames
would
answer
he
had
flushed
the
peculiar
flush
which
always
centred
between
his
eyes
lifting
his
hand
and
as
it
were
selecting
a
finger
he
bit
a
nail
delicately
then
drawling
it
out
between
set
lips
he
said
mrs
macander
is
a
cat
without
waiting
for
any
reply
he
left
the
room
when
he
went
into
timothy
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
course
to
pursue
on
getting
home
he
would
go
up
to
irene
and
say
well
i
won
my
case
and
there
an
end
of
it
i
do
want
to
be
hard
on
bosinney
i
see
if
we
ca
come
to
some
arrangement
he
sha
be
pressed
and
now
let
turn
over
a
new
leaf
we
let
the
house
and
get
out
of
these
fogs
we
go
down
to
robin
hill
at
once
never
meant
to
be
rough
with
you
let
shake
perhaps
she
would
let
him
kiss
her
and
forget
when
he
came
out
of
timothy
his
intentions
were
no
longer
so
simple
the
smouldering
jealousy
and
suspicion
of
months
blazed
up
within
him
he
would
put
an
end
to
that
sort
of
thing
once
and
for
all
he
would
not
have
her
drag
his
name
in
the
dirt
if
she
could
not
or
would
not
love
him
as
was
her
duty
and
his
should
not
play
him
tricks
with
anyone
else
he
would
tax
her
with
it
threaten
to
divorce
her
that
would
make
her
behave
she
would
never
face
that
if
she
did
he
was
staggered
this
had
not
occurred
to
him
what
if
she
did
what
if
she
made
him
a
confession
how
would
he
stand
then
he
would
have
to
bring
a
divorce
a
divorce
thus
close
the
word
was
paralyzing
so
utterly
at
variance
with
all
the
principles
that
had
hitherto
guided
his
life
its
lack
of
compromise
appalled
him
he
the
captain
of
a
ship
going
to
the
side
of
his
vessel
and
with
his
own
hands
throwing
over
the
most
precious
of
his
bales
this
jettisoning
of
his
property
with
his
own
hand
seemed
uncanny
to
soames
it
would
injure
him
in
his
profession
he
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
house
at
robin
hill
on
which
he
had
spent
so
much
money
so
much
at
a
sacrifice
and
she
she
would
no
longer
belong
to
him
not
even
in
name
she
would
pass
out
of
his
life
and
should
never
see
her
again
he
traversed
in
the
cab
the
length
of
a
street
without
getting
beyond
the
thought
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
but
perhaps
there
was
nothing
to
confess
even
now
very
likely
there
was
nothing
to
confess
was
it
wise
to
push
things
so
far
was
it
wise
to
put
himself
into
a
position
where
he
might
have
to
eat
his
words
the
result
of
this
case
would
ruin
bosinney
a
ruined
man
was
desperate
could
he
do
he
might
go
abroad
ruined
men
always
went
abroad
what
could
they
indeed
it
was
money
it
would
be
better
to
wait
and
see
how
things
turned
out
if
necessary
he
could
have
her
watched
the
agony
of
his
jealousy
for
all
the
world
like
the
crisis
of
an
aching
tooth
came
on
again
and
he
almost
cried
out
but
he
must
decide
fix
on
some
course
of
action
before
he
got
home
when
the
cab
drew
up
at
the
door
he
had
decided
nothing
he
entered
pale
his
hands
moist
with
perspiration
dreading
to
meet
her
burning
to
meet
her
ignorant
of
what
he
was
to
say
or
do
the
maid
bilson
was
in
the
hall
and
in
answer
to
his
question
where
is
your
mistress
told
him
that
forsyte
had
left
the
house
about
noon
taking
with
her
a
trunk
and
bag
snatching
the
sleeve
of
his
fur
coat
away
from
her
grasp
he
confronted
her
what
he
exclaimed
what
that
you
said
suddenly
recollecting
that
he
must
not
betray
emotion
he
added
what
message
did
she
leave
and
noticed
with
secret
terror
the
startled
look
of
the
maid
eyes
mrs
forsyte
left
no
message
no
message
very
well
thank
you
that
will
do
i
shall
be
dining
the
maid
went
downstairs
leaving
him
still
in
his
fur
coat
idly
turning
over
the
visiting
cards
in
the
porcelain
bowl
that
stood
on
the
carved
oak
rug
chest
in
the
hall
and
bareham
culcher
septimus
small
baynes
solomon
thornworthy
lady
bellis
miss
hermione
bellis
miss
winifred
bellis
miss
ella
bellis
who
the
devil
were
all
these
people
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
familiar
things
the
words
trunk
and
a
bag
played
a
in
his
brain
it
was
incredible
that
she
had
left
no
message
and
still
in
his
fur
coat
he
ran
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
as
a
young
married
man
when
he
comes
home
will
run
up
to
his
wife
room
everything
was
dainty
fresh
everything
in
perfect
order
on
the
great
bed
with
its
lilac
silk
quilt
was
the
bag
she
had
made
and
embroidered
with
her
own
hands
to
hold
her
sleeping
things
her
slippers
ready
at
the
foot
the
sheets
even
turned
over
at
the
head
as
though
expecting
her
on
the
table
stood
the
brushes
and
bottles
from
her
dressing
bag
his
own
present
there
must
then
be
some
mistake
what
bag
had
she
taken
he
went
to
the
bell
to
summon
bilson
but
remembered
in
time
that
he
must
assume
knowledge
of
where
irene
had
gone
take
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
and
grope
out
the
meaning
for
himself
he
locked
the
doors
and
tried
to
think
but
felt
his
brain
going
round
and
suddenly
tears
forced
themselves
into
his
eyes
hurriedly
pulling
off
his
coat
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
he
was
too
pale
a
greyish
tinge
all
over
his
face
he
poured
out
water
and
began
feverishly
washing
her
brushes
smelt
faintly
of
the
perfumed
lotion
she
used
for
her
hair
and
at
this
scent
the
burning
sickness
of
his
jealousy
seized
him
again
struggling
into
his
fur
he
ran
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
he
had
not
lost
all
command
of
himself
however
and
as
he
went
down
sloane
street
he
framed
a
story
for
use
in
case
he
should
not
find
her
at
bosinney
but
if
he
should
his
power
of
decision
again
failed
he
reached
the
house
without
knowing
what
he
should
do
if
he
did
find
her
there
it
was
after
office
hours
and
the
street
door
was
closed
the
woman
who
opened
it
could
not
say
whether
bosinney
were
in
or
no
she
had
not
seen
him
that
day
not
for
two
or
three
days
she
did
not
attend
to
him
now
nobody
attended
to
him
he
soames
interrupted
her
he
would
go
up
and
see
for
himself
he
went
up
with
a
dogged
white
face
the
top
floor
was
unlighted
the
door
closed
no
one
answered
his
ringing
he
could
hear
no
sound
he
was
obliged
to
descend
shivering
under
his
fur
a
chill
at
his
heart
hailing
a
cab
he
told
the
man
to
drive
to
park
lane
on
the
way
he
tried
to
recollect
when
he
had
last
given
her
a
cheque
she
could
not
have
more
than
three
or
four
pounds
but
there
were
her
jewels
and
with
exquisite
torture
he
remembered
how
much
money
she
could
raise
on
these
enough
to
take
them
abroad
enough
for
them
to
live
on
for
months
he
tried
to
calculate
the
cab
stopped
and
he
got
out
with
the
calculation
unmade
the
butler
asked
whether
soames
was
in
the
cab
the
master
had
told
him
they
were
both
expected
to
dinner
soames
answered
no
forsyte
has
a
the
butler
was
sorry
soames
thought
he
was
looking
at
him
inquisitively
and
remembering
that
he
was
not
in
dress
clothes
asked
anybody
here
to
dinner
warmson
nobody
but
and
dartie
again
it
seemed
to
soames
that
the
butler
was
looking
curiously
at
him
his
composure
gave
way
what
are
you
looking
at
he
said
what
the
matter
with
me
eh
the
butler
blushed
hung
up
the
fur
coat
murmured
something
that
sounded
like
nothing
sir
i
sure
sir
and
stealthily
withdrew
soames
walked
upstairs
passing
the
without
a
look
he
went
straight
up
to
his
mother
and
father
bedroom
james
standing
sideways
the
concave
lines
of
his
tall
lean
figure
displayed
to
advantage
in
and
evening
waistcoat
his
head
bent
the
end
of
his
white
tie
peeping
askew
from
underneath
one
white
dundreary
whisker
his
eyes
peering
with
intense
concentration
his
lips
pouting
was
hooking
the
top
hooks
of
his
wife
bodice
soames
stopped
he
felt
whether
because
he
had
come
upstairs
too
fast
or
for
some
other
reason
himself
had
been
asked
to
he
heard
his
father
voice
as
though
there
were
a
pin
in
his
mouth
saying
who
that
who
there
what
want
his
mother
here
felice
come
and
hook
this
your
master
never
get
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
throat
and
said
hoarsely
it
he
noticed
gratefully
the
affectionate
surprise
in
emily
well
my
dear
boy
and
james
as
he
dropped
the
hook
what
soames
brought
you
up
are
you
well
he
answered
mechanically
i
all
right
and
looked
at
them
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
bring
out
his
news
james
quick
to
take
alarm
began
you
do
look
well
i
expect
you
taken
a
liver
i
should
wonder
your
mother
give
you
but
emily
broke
in
quietly
have
you
brought
irene
soames
shook
his
head
no
he
stammered
left
me
emily
deserted
the
mirror
before
which
she
was
standing
her
tall
full
figure
lost
its
majesty
and
became
very
human
as
she
came
running
over
to
soames
my
dear
boy
my
dear
boy
she
put
her
lips
to
his
forehead
and
stroked
his
hand
james
too
had
turned
full
towards
his
son
his
face
looked
older
left
you
he
said
what
you
you
never
told
me
she
was
going
to
leave
soames
answered
surlily
how
could
i
tell
what
to
be
done
james
began
walking
up
and
down
he
looked
strange
and
without
a
coat
what
to
be
done
he
muttered
how
should
i
know
what
to
be
done
what
the
good
of
asking
me
nobody
tells
me
anything
and
then
they
come
and
ask
me
what
to
be
done
and
i
should
like
to
know
how
i
to
tell
them
here
your
mother
there
she
stands
she
does
say
anything
what
i
should
say
you
got
to
do
is
to
follow
soames
smiled
his
peculiar
supercilious
smile
had
never
before
looked
pitiable
i
do
know
where
she
gone
he
said
do
know
where
she
gone
said
james
how
mean
do
know
where
she
gone
where
suppose
she
gone
she
gone
after
that
young
bosinney
that
where
she
gone
i
knew
how
it
would
soames
in
the
long
silence
that
followed
felt
his
mother
pressing
his
hand
and
all
that
passed
seemed
to
pass
as
though
his
own
power
of
thinking
or
doing
had
gone
to
sleep
his
father
face
dusky
red
twitching
as
if
he
were
going
to
cry
and
words
breaking
out
that
seemed
rent
from
him
by
some
spasm
in
his
soul
there
be
a
scandal
i
always
said
then
no
one
saying
anything
and
there
you
stand
you
and
your
mother
and
emily
voice
calm
rather
contemptuous
come
now
james
soames
will
do
all
that
he
and
james
staring
at
the
floor
a
little
brokenly
well
i
ca
help
you
i
getting
old
do
you
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
my
and
his
mother
voice
again
soames
will
do
all
he
can
to
get
her
back
we
wo
talk
of
it
it
all
come
right
i
dare
and
james
well
i
ca
see
how
it
can
come
right
and
if
she
gone
off
with
that
young
bosinney
my
advice
to
you
is
not
to
listen
to
her
but
to
follow
her
and
get
her
once
more
soames
felt
his
mother
stroking
his
hand
in
token
of
her
approval
and
as
though
repeating
some
form
of
sacred
oath
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
i
will
all
three
went
down
to
the
together
there
were
gathered
the
three
girls
and
dartie
had
irene
been
present
the
family
circle
would
have
been
complete
james
sank
into
his
armchair
and
except
for
a
word
of
cold
greeting
to
dartie
whom
he
both
despised
and
dreaded
as
a
man
likely
to
be
always
in
want
of
money
he
said
nothing
till
dinner
was
announced
soames
too
was
silent
emily
alone
a
woman
of
cool
courage
maintained
a
conversation
with
winifred
on
trivial
subjects
she
was
never
more
composed
in
her
manner
and
conversation
than
that
evening
a
decision
having
been
come
to
not
to
speak
of
irene
flight
no
view
was
expressed
by
any
other
member
of
the
family
as
to
the
right
course
to
be
pursued
there
can
be
little
doubt
from
the
general
tone
adopted
in
relation
to
events
as
they
afterwards
turned
out
that
advice
do
you
listen
to
her
follow
her
and
get
her
back
would
with
here
and
there
an
exception
have
been
regarded
as
sound
not
only
in
park
lane
but
amongst
the
nicholases
the
rogers
and
at
timothy
just
as
it
would
surely
have
been
endorsed
by
that
wider
body
of
forsytes
all
over
london
who
were
merely
excluded
from
judgment
by
ignorance
of
the
story
in
spite
then
of
emily
efforts
the
dinner
was
served
by
warmson
and
the
footman
almost
in
silence
dartie
was
sulky
and
drank
all
he
could
get
the
girls
seldom
talked
to
each
other
at
any
time
james
asked
once
where
june
was
and
what
she
was
doing
with
herself
in
these
days
no
one
could
tell
him
he
sank
back
into
gloom
only
when
winifred
recounted
how
little
publius
had
given
his
bad
penny
to
a
beggar
did
he
brighten
up
ah
he
said
that
a
clever
little
chap
i
do
know
what
become
of
him
if
he
goes
on
like
this
an
intelligent
little
chap
i
call
him
but
it
was
only
a
flash
the
courses
succeeded
one
another
solemnly
under
the
electric
light
which
glared
down
onto
the
table
but
barely
reached
the
principal
ornament
of
the
walls
a
piece
by
turner
almost
entirely
composed
of
cordage
and
drowning
men
champagne
was
handed
and
then
a
bottle
of
james
prehistoric
port
but
as
by
the
chill
hand
of
some
skeleton
at
ten
soames
left
twice
in
reply
to
questions
he
had
said
that
irene
was
not
well
he
felt
he
could
no
longer
trust
himself
his
mother
kissed
him
with
her
large
soft
kiss
and
he
pressed
her
hand
a
flush
of
warmth
in
his
cheeks
he
walked
away
in
the
cold
wind
which
whistled
desolately
round
the
corners
of
the
streets
under
a
sky
of
clear
alive
with
stars
he
noticed
neither
their
frosty
greeting
nor
the
crackle
of
the
nor
the
hurrying
in
their
shabby
furs
nor
the
pinched
faces
of
vagabonds
at
street
corners
winter
was
come
but
soames
hastened
home
oblivious
his
hands
trembled
as
he
took
the
late
letters
from
the
gilt
wire
cage
into
which
they
had
been
thrust
through
the
slit
in
the
door
none
from
irene
he
went
into
the
the
fire
was
bright
there
his
chair
drawn
up
to
it
slippers
ready
spirit
case
and
carven
cigarette
box
on
the
table
but
after
staring
at
it
all
for
a
minute
or
two
he
turned
out
the
light
and
went
upstairs
there
was
a
fire
too
in
his
but
her
room
was
dark
and
cold
it
was
into
this
room
that
soames
went
he
made
a
great
illumination
with
candles
and
for
a
long
time
continued
pacing
up
and
down
between
the
bed
and
the
door
he
could
not
get
used
to
the
thought
that
she
had
really
left
him
and
as
though
still
searching
for
some
message
some
reason
some
reading
of
all
the
mystery
of
his
married
life
he
began
opening
every
recess
and
drawer
there
were
her
dresses
he
had
always
liked
indeed
insisted
that
she
should
be
had
taken
very
few
two
or
three
at
most
and
drawer
after
drawer
full
of
linen
and
silk
things
was
untouched
perhaps
after
all
it
was
only
a
freak
and
she
had
gone
to
the
seaside
for
a
few
days
change
if
only
that
were
so
and
she
were
really
coming
back
he
would
never
again
do
as
he
had
done
that
fatal
night
before
last
never
again
run
that
it
was
her
duty
her
duty
as
a
wife
though
she
did
belong
to
would
never
again
run
that
risk
she
was
evidently
not
quite
right
in
her
head
he
stooped
over
the
drawer
where
she
kept
her
jewels
it
was
not
locked
and
came
open
as
he
pulled
the
jewel
box
had
the
key
in
it
this
surprised
him
until
he
remembered
that
it
was
sure
to
be
empty
he
opened
it
it
was
far
from
empty
divided
in
little
green
velvet
compartments
were
all
the
things
he
had
given
her
even
her
watch
and
stuck
into
the
recess
that
contained
the
watch
was
a
note
addressed
forsyte
in
irene
handwriting
think
i
have
taken
nothing
that
you
or
your
people
have
given
me
and
that
was
all
he
looked
at
the
clasps
and
bracelets
of
diamonds
and
pearls
at
the
little
flat
gold
watch
with
a
great
diamond
set
in
sapphires
at
the
chains
and
rings
each
in
its
nest
and
the
tears
rushed
up
in
his
eyes
and
dropped
upon
them
nothing
that
she
could
have
done
nothing
that
she
had
done
brought
home
to
him
like
this
the
inner
significance
of
her
act
for
the
moment
perhaps
he
understood
nearly
all
there
was
to
that
she
loathed
him
that
she
had
loathed
him
for
years
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
they
were
like
people
living
in
different
worlds
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
never
had
been
even
that
she
had
she
was
to
be
pitied
in
that
moment
of
emotion
he
betrayed
the
forsyte
in
himself
his
interests
his
capable
of
almost
anything
was
lifted
into
the
pure
ether
of
the
selfless
and
unpractical
such
moments
pass
quickly
and
as
though
with
the
tears
he
had
purged
himself
of
weakness
he
got
up
locked
the
box
and
slowly
almost
trembling
carried
it
with
him
into
the
other
room
chapter
victory
june
had
waited
for
her
chance
scanning
the
duller
columns
of
the
journals
morning
and
evening
with
an
assiduity
which
at
first
puzzled
old
jolyon
and
when
her
chance
came
she
took
it
with
all
the
promptitude
and
resolute
tenacity
of
her
character
she
will
always
remember
best
in
her
life
that
morning
when
at
last
she
saw
amongst
the
reliable
cause
list
of
the
times
newspaper
under
the
heading
of
court
xiii
justice
bentham
the
case
of
forsyte
bosinney
like
a
gambler
who
stakes
his
last
piece
of
money
she
had
prepared
to
hazard
her
all
upon
this
throw
it
was
not
her
nature
to
contemplate
defeat
how
unless
with
the
instinct
of
a
woman
in
love
she
knew
that
bosinney
discomfiture
in
this
action
was
assured
can
not
be
this
assumption
however
she
laid
her
plans
as
upon
a
certainty
half
past
eleven
found
her
at
watch
in
the
gallery
of
court
and
there
she
remained
till
the
case
of
forsyte
bosinney
was
over
bosinney
absence
did
not
disquiet
her
she
had
felt
instinctively
that
he
would
not
defend
himself
at
the
end
of
the
judgment
she
hastened
down
and
took
a
cab
to
his
rooms
she
passed
the
open
and
the
offices
on
the
three
lower
floors
without
attracting
notice
not
till
she
reached
the
top
did
her
difficulties
begin
her
ring
was
not
answered
she
had
now
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
she
would
go
down
and
ask
the
caretaker
in
the
basement
to
let
her
in
to
await
bosinney
return
or
remain
patiently
outside
the
door
trusting
that
no
one
would
come
up
she
decided
on
the
latter
course
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
in
freezing
vigil
on
the
landing
before
it
occurred
to
her
that
bosinney
had
been
used
to
leave
the
key
of
his
rooms
under
the
she
looked
and
found
it
there
for
some
minutes
she
could
not
decide
to
make
use
of
it
at
last
she
let
herself
in
and
left
the
door
open
that
anyone
who
came
might
see
she
was
there
on
business
this
was
not
the
same
june
who
had
paid
the
trembling
visit
five
months
ago
those
months
of
suffering
and
restraint
had
made
her
less
sensitive
she
had
dwelt
on
this
visit
so
long
with
such
minuteness
that
its
terrors
were
discounted
beforehand
she
was
not
there
to
fail
this
time
for
if
she
failed
no
one
could
help
her
like
some
mother
beast
on
the
watch
over
her
young
her
little
quick
figure
never
stood
still
in
that
room
but
wandered
from
wall
to
wall
from
window
to
door
fingering
now
one
thing
now
another
there
was
dust
everywhere
the
room
could
not
have
been
cleaned
for
weeks
and
june
quick
to
catch
at
anything
that
should
buoy
up
her
hope
saw
in
it
a
sign
that
he
had
been
obliged
for
economy
sake
to
give
up
his
servant
she
looked
into
the
bedroom
the
bed
was
roughly
made
as
though
by
the
hand
of
man
listening
intently
she
darted
in
and
peered
into
his
cupboards
a
few
shirts
and
collars
a
pair
of
muddy
room
was
bare
even
of
garments
she
stole
back
to
the
and
now
she
noticed
the
absence
of
all
the
little
things
he
had
set
store
by
the
clock
that
had
been
his
mother
the
that
had
hung
over
the
sofa
two
really
valuable
old
prints
of
harrow
where
his
father
had
been
at
school
and
last
not
least
the
piece
of
japanese
pottery
she
herself
had
given
him
all
were
gone
and
in
spite
of
the
rage
roused
within
her
championing
soul
at
the
thought
that
the
world
should
treat
him
thus
their
disappearance
augured
happily
for
the
success
of
her
plan
it
was
while
looking
at
the
spot
where
the
piece
of
japanese
pottery
had
stood
that
she
felt
a
strange
certainty
of
being
watched
and
turning
saw
irene
in
the
open
doorway
the
two
stood
gazing
at
each
other
for
a
minute
in
silence
then
june
walked
forward
and
held
out
her
hand
irene
did
not
take
it
when
her
hand
was
refused
june
put
it
behind
her
her
eyes
grew
steady
with
anger
she
waited
for
irene
to
speak
and
thus
waiting
took
in
with
rage
of
jealousy
suspicion
and
curiosity
every
detail
of
her
friend
face
and
dress
and
figure
irene
was
clothed
in
her
long
grey
fur
the
travelling
cap
on
her
head
left
a
wave
of
gold
hair
visible
above
her
forehead
the
soft
fullness
of
the
coat
made
her
face
as
small
as
a
child
unlike
june
cheeks
her
cheeks
had
no
colour
in
them
but
were
ivory
white
and
pinched
as
if
with
cold
dark
circles
lay
round
her
eyes
in
one
hand
she
held
a
bunch
of
violets
she
looked
back
at
june
no
smile
on
her
lips
and
with
those
great
dark
eyes
fastened
on
her
the
girl
for
all
her
startled
anger
felt
something
of
the
old
spell
she
spoke
first
after
all
what
have
you
come
for
but
the
feeling
that
she
herself
was
being
asked
the
same
question
made
her
add
this
horrible
case
i
came
to
tell
has
lost
irene
did
not
speak
her
eyes
never
moved
from
june
face
and
the
girl
cried
do
stand
there
as
if
you
were
made
of
stone
irene
laughed
i
wish
to
god
i
were
but
june
turned
away
stop
she
cried
do
tell
me
i
do
want
to
hear
i
do
want
to
hear
what
you
come
for
i
do
want
to
hear
and
like
some
uneasy
spirit
she
began
swiftly
walking
to
and
fro
suddenly
she
broke
out
i
was
here
first
we
ca
both
stay
here
together
on
irene
face
a
smile
wandered
up
and
died
out
like
a
flicker
of
firelight
she
did
not
move
and
then
it
was
that
june
perceived
under
the
softness
and
immobility
of
this
figure
something
desperate
and
resolved
something
not
to
be
turned
away
something
dangerous
she
tore
off
her
hat
and
putting
both
hands
to
her
brow
pressed
back
the
bronze
mass
of
her
hair
you
have
no
right
here
she
cried
defiantly
irene
answered
i
have
no
right
anywhere
what
do
you
mean
i
have
left
soames
you
always
wanted
me
to
june
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
do
i
do
want
to
hear
do
want
to
know
anything
it
impossible
to
fight
with
you
what
makes
you
stand
like
that
why
do
you
go
irene
lips
moved
she
seemed
to
be
saying
where
should
i
go
june
turned
to
the
window
she
could
see
the
face
of
a
clock
down
in
the
street
it
was
nearly
four
at
any
moment
he
might
come
she
looked
back
across
her
shoulder
and
her
face
was
distorted
with
anger
but
irene
had
not
moved
in
her
gloved
hands
she
ceaselessly
turned
and
twisted
the
little
bunch
of
violets
the
tears
of
rage
and
disappointment
rolled
down
june
cheeks
how
could
you
come
she
said
you
have
been
a
false
friend
to
me
again
irene
laughed
june
saw
that
she
had
played
a
wrong
card
and
broke
down
why
have
you
come
she
sobbed
you
ruined
my
life
and
now
you
want
to
ruin
his
irene
mouth
quivered
her
eyes
met
june
with
a
look
so
mournful
that
the
girl
cried
out
in
the
midst
of
her
sobbing
no
no
but
irene
head
bent
till
it
touched
her
breast
she
turned
and
went
quickly
out
hiding
her
lips
with
the
little
bunch
of
violets
june
ran
to
the
door
she
heard
the
footsteps
going
down
and
down
she
called
out
come
back
irene
come
back
the
footsteps
died
away
bewildered
and
torn
the
girl
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
why
had
irene
gone
leaving
her
mistress
of
the
field
what
did
it
mean
had
she
really
given
him
up
to
her
or
had
she
and
she
was
the
prey
of
a
gnawing
uncertainty
bosinney
did
not
come
about
six
that
afternoon
old
jolyon
returned
from
wistaria
avenue
where
now
almost
every
day
he
spent
some
hours
and
asked
if
his
were
upstairs
on
being
told
that
she
had
just
come
in
he
sent
up
to
her
room
to
request
her
to
come
down
and
speak
to
him
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
her
that
he
was
reconciled
with
her
father
in
future
bygones
must
be
bygones
he
would
no
longer
live
alone
or
practically
alone
in
this
great
house
he
was
going
to
give
it
up
and
take
one
in
the
country
for
his
son
where
they
could
all
go
and
live
together
if
june
did
not
like
this
she
could
have
an
allowance
and
live
by
herself
it
would
make
much
difference
to
her
for
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
shown
him
any
affection
but
when
june
came
down
her
face
was
pinched
and
piteous
there
was
a
strained
pathetic
look
in
her
eyes
she
snuggled
up
in
her
old
attitude
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
what
he
said
compared
but
poorly
with
the
clear
authoritative
injured
statement
he
had
thought
out
with
much
care
his
heart
felt
sore
as
the
great
heart
of
a
feels
sore
when
its
youngling
flies
and
bruises
its
wing
his
words
halted
as
though
he
were
apologizing
for
having
at
last
deviated
from
the
path
of
virtue
and
succumbed
in
defiance
of
sounder
principles
to
his
more
natural
instincts
he
seemed
nervous
lest
in
thus
announcing
his
intentions
he
should
be
setting
his
granddaughter
a
bad
example
and
now
that
he
came
to
the
point
his
way
of
putting
the
suggestion
that
if
she
did
like
it
she
could
live
by
herself
and
lump
it
was
delicate
in
the
extreme
and
if
by
any
chance
my
darling
he
said
you
found
you
did
get
them
why
i
could
make
that
all
right
you
could
have
what
you
liked
we
could
find
a
little
flat
in
london
where
you
could
set
up
and
i
could
be
running
to
continually
but
the
children
he
added
are
dear
little
things
then
in
the
midst
of
this
grave
rather
transparent
explanation
of
changed
policy
his
eyes
twinkled
this
astonish
timothy
weak
nerves
that
precious
young
thing
will
have
something
to
say
about
this
or
i
a
dutchman
june
had
not
yet
spoken
perched
thus
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
her
head
above
him
her
face
was
invisible
but
presently
he
felt
her
warm
cheek
against
his
own
and
knew
that
at
all
events
there
was
nothing
very
alarming
in
her
attitude
towards
his
news
he
began
to
take
courage
you
like
your
father
he
an
amiable
chap
never
was
much
push
about
him
but
easy
to
get
on
with
you
find
him
artistic
and
all
and
old
jolyon
bethought
him
of
the
dozen
or
so
drawings
all
carefully
locked
up
in
his
bedroom
for
now
that
his
son
was
going
to
become
a
man
of
property
he
did
not
think
them
quite
such
poor
things
as
heretofore
as
to
stepmother
he
said
using
the
word
with
some
little
difficulty
i
call
her
a
refined
bit
of
a
gummidge
i
should
very
fond
of
jo
and
the
children
he
this
sentence
ran
like
music
through
all
his
solemn
are
sweet
little
things
if
june
had
known
those
words
but
reincarnated
that
tender
love
for
little
children
for
the
young
and
weak
which
in
the
past
had
made
him
desert
his
son
for
her
tiny
self
and
now
as
the
cycle
rolled
was
taking
him
from
her
but
he
began
to
get
alarmed
at
her
silence
and
asked
impatiently
well
what
do
you
say
june
slid
down
to
his
knee
and
she
in
her
turn
began
her
tale
she
thought
it
would
all
go
splendidly
she
did
not
see
any
difficulty
and
she
did
not
care
a
bit
what
people
thought
old
jolyon
wriggled
h
then
people
would
think
he
had
thought
that
after
all
these
years
perhaps
they
would
well
he
could
help
it
nevertheless
he
could
not
approve
of
his
granddaughter
way
of
putting
ought
to
mind
what
people
thought
yet
he
said
nothing
his
feelings
were
too
mixed
too
inconsistent
for
expression
on
did
not
care
what
business
was
it
of
theirs
there
was
only
one
with
her
cheek
pressing
against
his
knee
old
jolyon
knew
at
once
that
this
something
was
no
trifle
as
he
was
going
to
buy
a
house
in
the
country
would
he
please
that
splendid
house
of
soames
at
robin
hill
it
was
finished
it
was
perfectly
beautiful
and
no
one
would
live
in
it
now
they
would
all
be
so
happy
there
old
jolyon
was
on
the
alert
at
once
was
the
of
property
going
to
live
in
his
new
house
then
he
never
alluded
to
soames
now
but
under
this
title
no
he
was
not
she
knew
that
he
was
not
how
did
she
know
she
could
not
tell
him
but
she
knew
she
knew
nearly
for
certain
it
was
most
unlikely
circumstances
had
changed
irene
words
still
rang
in
her
head
i
have
left
soames
where
should
i
go
but
she
kept
silence
about
that
if
her
grandfather
would
only
buy
it
and
settle
that
wretched
claim
that
ought
never
to
have
been
made
on
phil
it
would
be
the
very
best
thing
for
everybody
and
might
come
straight
and
june
put
her
lips
to
his
forehead
and
pressed
them
close
but
old
jolyon
freed
himself
from
her
caress
his
face
wore
the
judicial
look
which
came
upon
it
when
he
dealt
with
affairs
he
asked
what
did
she
mean
there
was
something
behind
all
she
been
seeing
bosinney
june
answered
no
but
i
have
been
to
his
been
to
his
rooms
who
took
you
there
june
faced
him
steadily
i
went
alone
he
has
lost
that
case
i
care
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
i
want
to
help
him
and
i
will
old
jolyon
asked
again
have
you
seen
him
his
glance
seemed
to
pierce
right
through
the
girl
eyes
into
her
soul
again
june
answered
no
he
was
not
there
i
waited
but
he
did
not
old
jolyon
made
a
movement
of
relief
she
had
risen
and
looked
down
at
him
so
slight
and
light
and
young
but
so
fixed
and
so
determined
and
disturbed
vexed
as
he
was
he
could
not
frown
away
that
fixed
look
the
feeling
of
being
beaten
of
the
reins
having
slipped
of
being
old
and
tired
mastered
him
ah
he
said
at
last
you
get
yourself
into
a
mess
one
of
these
days
i
can
see
you
want
your
own
way
in
visited
by
one
of
his
strange
bursts
of
philosophy
he
added
like
that
you
were
born
and
like
that
you
stay
until
you
die
and
he
who
in
his
dealings
with
men
of
business
with
boards
with
forsytes
of
all
descriptions
with
such
as
were
not
forsytes
had
always
had
his
own
way
looked
at
his
indomitable
grandchild
he
felt
in
her
that
quality
which
above
all
others
he
unconsciously
admired
do
you
know
what
they
say
is
going
on
he
said
slowly
june
crimsoned
i
i
do
do
care
and
she
stamped
her
foot
i
believe
said
old
jolyon
dropping
his
eyes
that
you
have
him
if
he
were
dead
there
was
a
long
silence
before
he
spoke
again
but
as
to
buying
this
do
know
what
you
talking
about
june
said
that
she
did
she
knew
that
he
could
get
it
if
he
wanted
he
would
only
have
to
give
what
it
cost
what
it
cost
you
know
nothing
about
it
i
wo
go
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
that
young
but
you
need
you
can
go
to
uncle
james
if
you
ca
buy
the
house
will
you
pay
his
lawsuit
claim
i
know
he
is
terribly
hard
seen
it
you
can
stop
it
out
of
my
money
a
twinkle
came
into
old
jolyon
eyes
stop
it
out
of
your
money
a
pretty
way
and
what
will
you
do
pray
without
your
money
but
secretly
the
idea
of
wresting
the
house
from
james
and
his
son
had
begun
to
take
hold
of
him
he
had
heard
on
forsyte
much
comment
much
rather
doubtful
praise
of
this
house
it
was
artistic
but
a
fine
place
to
take
from
the
of
property
that
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
would
be
a
crowning
triumph
over
james
practical
proof
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
man
of
property
of
jo
to
put
him
back
in
his
proper
position
and
there
to
keep
him
secure
justice
once
for
all
on
those
who
had
chosen
to
regard
his
son
as
a
poor
penniless
outcast
he
would
see
he
would
see
it
might
be
out
of
the
question
he
was
not
going
to
pay
a
fancy
price
but
if
it
could
be
done
why
perhaps
he
would
do
it
and
still
more
secretly
he
knew
that
he
could
not
refuse
her
but
he
did
not
commit
himself
he
would
think
it
said
to
june
chapter
departure
old
jolyon
was
not
given
to
hasty
decisions
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
continued
to
think
over
the
purchase
of
the
house
at
robin
hill
had
not
june
face
told
him
that
he
would
have
no
peace
until
he
acted
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
asked
him
what
time
she
should
order
the
carriage
carriage
he
said
with
some
appearance
of
innocence
what
for
not
going
out
she
answered
if
you
do
go
early
you
wo
catch
uncle
james
before
he
goes
into
the
james
what
about
your
uncle
james
the
house
she
replied
in
such
a
voice
that
he
no
longer
pretended
ignorance
i
not
made
up
my
mind
he
said
you
must
you
must
oh
of
me
old
jolyon
grumbled
out
think
of
always
thinking
of
you
but
you
do
think
of
yourself
you
do
think
what
you
letting
yourself
in
for
well
order
the
carriage
at
ten
at
a
quarter
past
he
was
placing
his
umbrella
in
the
stand
at
park
did
not
choose
to
relinquish
his
hat
and
coat
telling
warmson
that
he
wanted
to
see
his
master
he
went
without
being
announced
into
the
study
and
sat
down
james
was
still
in
the
talking
to
soames
who
had
come
round
again
before
breakfast
on
hearing
who
his
visitor
was
he
muttered
nervously
now
what
he
want
i
wonder
he
then
got
up
well
he
said
to
soames
do
you
go
doing
anything
in
a
hurry
the
first
thing
is
to
find
out
where
she
should
go
to
stainer
about
it
they
the
best
men
if
they
ca
find
her
nobody
and
suddenly
moved
to
strange
softness
he
muttered
to
himself
poor
little
thing
i
ca
tell
what
she
was
thinking
about
and
went
out
blowing
his
nose
old
jolyon
did
not
rise
on
seeing
his
brother
but
held
out
his
hand
and
exchanged
with
him
the
clasp
of
a
forsyte
james
took
another
chair
by
the
table
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
well
he
said
how
are
you
we
do
see
much
of
you
nowadays
old
jolyon
paid
no
attention
to
the
remark
how
emily
he
asked
and
waiting
for
no
reply
went
on
i
come
to
see
you
about
this
affair
of
young
bosinney
i
told
that
new
house
of
his
is
a
white
i
do
know
anything
about
a
white
elephant
said
james
i
know
lost
his
case
and
i
should
say
he
go
old
jolyon
was
not
slow
to
seize
the
opportunity
this
gave
him
i
should
wonder
a
bit
he
agreed
and
if
he
goes
bankrupt
the
of
is
soames
be
out
of
pocket
now
what
i
was
thinking
was
this
if
he
not
going
to
live
there
seeing
both
surprise
and
suspicion
in
james
eye
he
quickly
went
on
i
do
want
to
know
anything
i
suppose
irene
put
her
foot
not
material
to
me
but
i
thinking
of
a
house
in
the
country
myself
not
too
far
from
london
and
if
it
suited
me
i
do
say
that
i
look
at
it
at
a
james
listened
to
this
statement
with
a
strange
mixture
of
doubt
suspicion
and
relief
merging
into
a
dread
of
something
behind
and
tinged
with
the
remains
of
his
old
undoubted
reliance
upon
his
elder
brother
good
faith
and
judgment
there
was
anxiety
too
as
to
what
old
jolyon
could
have
heard
and
how
he
had
heard
it
and
a
sort
of
hopefulness
arising
from
the
thought
that
if
june
connection
with
bosinney
were
completely
at
an
end
her
grandfather
would
hardly
seem
anxious
to
help
the
young
fellow
altogether
he
was
puzzled
as
he
did
not
like
either
to
show
this
or
to
commit
himself
in
any
way
he
said
they
tell
me
you
altering
your
will
in
favour
of
your
he
had
not
been
told
this
he
had
merely
added
the
fact
of
having
seen
old
jolyon
with
his
son
and
grandchildren
to
the
fact
that
he
had
taken
his
will
away
from
forsyte
bustard
and
forsyte
the
shot
went
home
who
told
you
that
asked
old
jolyon
i
sure
i
do
know
said
james
i
ca
remember
know
somebody
told
me
soames
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
this
house
he
not
likely
to
part
with
it
except
at
a
good
well
said
old
jolyon
if
he
thinks
i
going
to
pay
a
fancy
price
he
mistaken
i
not
got
the
money
to
throw
away
that
he
seems
to
have
let
him
try
and
sell
it
at
a
forced
sale
and
see
what
he
get
it
not
every
man
house
i
hear
james
who
was
secretly
also
of
this
opinion
answered
it
a
gentleman
house
soames
is
here
now
if
you
like
to
see
no
said
old
jolyon
i
have
got
as
far
as
that
and
i
not
likely
to
i
can
see
that
very
well
if
i
met
in
this
manner
james
was
a
little
cowed
when
it
came
to
the
actual
figures
of
a
commercial
transaction
he
was
sure
of
himself
for
then
he
was
dealing
with
facts
not
with
men
but
preliminary
negotiations
such
as
these
made
him
never
knew
quite
how
far
he
could
go
well
he
said
i
know
nothing
about
it
soames
he
tells
me
nothing
i
should
think
he
entertain
a
question
of
oh
said
old
jolyon
do
let
him
make
a
favour
of
it
he
placed
his
hat
on
his
head
in
dudgeon
the
door
was
opened
and
soames
came
in
there
a
policeman
out
here
he
said
with
his
half
smile
for
uncle
old
jolyon
looked
at
him
angrily
and
james
said
a
policeman
i
know
anything
about
a
policeman
but
i
suppose
you
know
something
about
him
he
added
to
old
jolyon
with
a
look
of
suspicion
i
suppose
better
see
him
in
the
hall
an
inspector
of
police
stood
stolidly
regarding
with
eyes
the
fine
old
english
furniture
picked
up
by
james
at
the
famous
mavrojano
sale
in
portman
square
you
find
my
brother
in
there
said
james
the
inspector
raised
his
fingers
respectfully
to
his
peaked
cap
and
entered
the
study
james
saw
him
go
in
with
a
strange
sensation
well
he
said
to
soames
i
suppose
we
must
wait
and
see
what
he
wants
your
uncle
been
here
about
the
house
he
returned
with
soames
into
the
but
could
not
rest
now
what
does
he
want
he
murmured
again
who
replied
soames
the
inspector
they
sent
him
round
from
stanhope
gate
that
all
i
know
that
of
uncle
jolyon
has
been
pilfering
i
should
wonder
but
in
spite
of
his
calmness
he
too
was
ill
at
ease
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
old
jolyon
came
in
he
walked
up
to
the
table
and
stood
there
perfectly
silent
pulling
at
his
long
white
moustaches
james
gazed
up
at
him
with
opening
mouth
he
had
never
seen
his
brother
look
like
this
old
jolyon
raised
his
hand
and
said
slowly
young
bosinney
has
been
run
over
in
the
fog
and
then
standing
above
his
brother
and
his
nephew
and
looking
down
at
him
with
his
deep
eyes
he
said
james
jaw
dropped
suicide
what
should
he
do
that
for
old
jolyon
answered
sternly
god
knows
if
you
and
your
son
do
but
james
did
not
reply
for
all
men
of
great
age
even
for
all
forsytes
life
has
had
bitter
experiences
the
who
sees
them
wrapped
in
cloaks
of
custom
wealth
and
comfort
would
never
suspect
that
such
black
shadows
had
fallen
on
their
roads
to
every
man
of
great
sir
walter
bentham
idea
of
suicide
has
once
at
least
been
present
in
the
of
his
soul
on
the
threshold
waiting
to
enter
held
out
from
the
inmost
chamber
by
some
chance
reality
some
vague
fear
some
painful
hope
to
forsytes
that
final
renunciation
of
property
is
hard
oh
it
is
hard
they
achieve
it
and
yet
how
near
have
they
not
sometimes
been
so
even
with
james
then
in
the
medley
of
his
thoughts
he
broke
out
why
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
yesterday
over
in
the
fog
they
know
his
name
he
turned
from
one
face
to
the
other
in
his
confusion
of
soul
but
instinctively
all
the
time
he
was
rejecting
that
rumour
of
suicide
he
dared
not
entertain
this
thought
so
against
his
interest
against
the
interest
of
his
son
of
every
forsyte
he
strove
against
it
and
as
his
nature
ever
unconsciously
rejected
that
which
it
could
not
with
safety
accept
so
gradually
he
overcame
this
fear
it
was
an
accident
it
must
have
been
old
jolyon
broke
in
on
his
reverie
death
was
instantaneous
he
lay
all
day
yesterday
at
the
hospital
there
was
nothing
to
tell
them
who
he
was
i
am
going
there
now
you
and
your
son
had
better
come
no
one
opposing
this
command
he
led
the
way
from
the
room
the
day
was
still
and
clear
and
bright
and
driving
over
to
park
lane
from
stanhope
gate
old
jolyon
had
had
the
carriage
open
sitting
back
on
the
padded
cushions
finishing
his
cigar
he
had
noticed
with
pleasure
the
keen
crispness
of
the
air
the
bustle
of
the
cabs
and
people
the
strange
almost
parisian
alacrity
that
the
first
fine
day
will
bring
into
london
streets
after
a
spell
of
fog
or
rain
and
he
had
felt
so
happy
he
had
not
felt
like
it
for
months
his
confession
to
june
was
off
his
mind
he
had
the
prospect
of
his
son
above
all
of
his
grandchildren
company
in
the
he
had
appointed
to
meet
young
jolyon
at
the
hotch
potch
that
very
manning
it
again
and
there
was
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
a
coming
encounter
a
coming
victory
over
james
and
the
of
property
in
the
matter
of
the
house
he
had
the
carriage
closed
now
he
had
no
heart
to
look
on
gaiety
nor
was
it
right
that
forsytes
should
be
seen
driving
with
an
inspector
of
police
in
that
carriage
the
inspector
spoke
again
of
the
death
it
was
not
so
very
there
the
driver
says
the
gentleman
must
have
had
time
to
see
what
he
was
about
he
seemed
to
walk
right
into
it
it
appears
that
he
was
very
hard
up
we
found
several
pawn
tickets
at
his
rooms
his
account
at
the
bank
is
overdrawn
and
there
this
case
in
papers
his
cold
blue
eyes
travelled
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
forsytes
in
the
carriage
old
jolyon
watching
from
his
corner
saw
his
brother
face
change
and
the
brooding
worried
look
deepen
on
it
at
the
inspector
words
indeed
all
james
doubts
and
fears
revived
overdrawn
account
these
words
that
had
all
his
life
been
a
nightmare
to
him
seemed
to
make
uncannily
real
that
suspicion
of
suicide
which
must
on
no
account
be
entertained
he
sought
his
eye
but
taciturn
immovable
soames
gave
no
answering
look
and
to
old
jolyon
watching
divining
the
league
of
mutual
defence
between
them
there
came
an
overmastering
desire
to
have
his
own
son
at
his
side
as
though
this
visit
to
the
dead
man
body
was
a
battle
in
which
otherwise
he
must
meet
those
two
and
the
thought
of
how
to
keep
june
name
out
of
the
business
kept
whirring
in
his
brain
james
had
his
son
to
support
him
why
should
he
not
send
for
jo
taking
out
his
he
pencilled
the
following
message
round
at
once
i
sent
the
carriage
for
you
on
getting
out
he
gave
this
card
to
his
coachman
telling
him
to
fast
as
possible
to
the
hotch
potch
club
and
if
jolyon
forsyte
were
there
to
give
him
the
card
and
bring
him
at
once
if
not
there
yet
he
was
to
wait
till
he
came
he
followed
the
others
slowly
up
the
steps
leaning
on
his
umbrella
and
stood
a
moment
to
get
his
breath
the
inspector
said
this
is
the
mortuary
sir
but
take
your
in
the
bare
room
empty
of
all
but
a
streak
of
sunshine
smeared
along
the
dustless
floor
lay
a
form
covered
by
a
sheet
with
a
huge
steady
hand
the
inspector
took
the
hem
and
turned
it
back
a
sightless
face
gazed
up
at
them
and
on
either
side
of
that
sightless
defiant
face
the
three
forsytes
gazed
down
in
each
one
of
them
the
secret
emotions
fears
and
pity
of
his
own
nature
rose
and
fell
like
the
rising
falling
waves
of
life
whose
wash
those
white
walls
barred
out
now
for
ever
from
bosinney
and
in
each
one
of
them
the
trend
of
his
nature
the
odd
essential
spring
which
moved
him
in
fashions
minutely
unalterably
different
from
those
of
every
other
human
being
forced
him
to
a
different
attitude
of
thought
far
from
the
others
yet
inscrutably
close
each
stood
thus
alone
with
death
silent
his
eyes
lowered
the
inspector
asked
softly
you
identify
the
gentleman
sir
old
jolyon
raised
his
head
and
nodded
he
looked
at
his
brother
opposite
at
that
long
lean
figure
brooding
over
the
dead
man
with
face
dusky
red
and
strained
grey
eyes
and
at
the
figure
of
soames
white
and
still
by
his
father
side
and
all
that
he
had
felt
against
those
two
was
gone
like
smoke
in
the
long
white
presence
of
death
whence
comes
it
how
comes
sudden
reverse
of
all
that
goes
before
blind
setting
forth
on
a
path
that
leads
to
where
dark
quenching
of
the
fire
the
heavy
brutal
that
all
men
must
go
through
keeping
their
eyes
clear
and
brave
unto
the
end
small
and
of
no
import
insects
though
they
are
and
across
old
jolyon
face
there
flitted
a
gleam
for
soames
murmuring
to
the
inspector
crept
noiselessly
away
then
suddenly
james
raised
his
eyes
there
was
a
queer
appeal
in
that
suspicious
troubled
look
i
know
i
no
match
for
you
it
seemed
to
say
and
hunting
for
handkerchief
he
wiped
his
brow
then
bending
sorrowful
and
lank
over
the
dead
man
he
too
turned
and
hurried
out
old
jolyon
stood
still
as
death
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
body
who
shall
tell
of
what
he
was
thinking
of
himself
when
his
hair
was
brown
like
the
hair
of
that
young
fellow
dead
before
him
of
himself
with
his
battle
just
beginning
the
long
long
battle
he
had
loved
the
battle
that
was
over
for
this
young
man
almost
before
it
had
begun
of
his
with
her
broken
hopes
of
that
other
woman
of
the
strangeness
and
the
pity
of
it
and
the
irony
inscrutable
and
bitter
of
that
end
justice
there
was
no
justice
for
men
for
they
were
ever
in
the
dark
or
perhaps
in
his
philosophy
he
thought
better
to
be
out
of
it
all
better
to
have
done
with
it
like
this
poor
youth
some
one
touched
him
on
the
arm
a
tear
started
up
and
wetted
his
eyelash
well
he
said
i
no
good
here
i
better
be
going
you
come
to
me
as
soon
as
you
can
jo
and
with
his
head
bowed
he
went
away
it
was
young
jolyon
turn
to
take
his
stand
beside
the
dead
man
round
whose
fallen
body
he
seemed
to
see
all
the
forsytes
breathless
and
prostrated
the
stroke
had
fallen
too
swiftly
the
forces
underlying
every
that
take
no
denial
working
through
cross
currents
to
their
ironical
end
had
met
and
fused
with
a
flung
out
the
victim
and
flattened
to
the
ground
all
those
that
stood
around
or
so
at
all
events
young
jolyon
seemed
to
see
them
lying
around
bosinney
body
he
asked
the
inspector
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
and
the
latter
like
a
man
who
does
not
every
day
get
such
a
chance
again
detailed
such
facts
as
were
known
there
more
here
sir
however
he
said
than
meets
the
eye
i
believe
in
suicide
nor
in
pure
accident
myself
it
more
likely
i
think
that
he
was
suffering
under
great
stress
of
mind
and
took
no
notice
of
things
about
him
perhaps
you
can
throw
some
light
on
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
little
packet
and
laid
it
on
the
table
carefully
undoing
it
he
revealed
a
lady
handkerchief
pinned
through
the
folds
with
a
pin
of
discoloured
venetian
gold
the
stone
of
which
had
fallen
from
the
socket
a
scent
of
dried
violets
rose
to
young
jolyon
nostrils
found
in
his
breast
pocket
said
the
inspector
the
name
has
been
cut
away
young
jolyon
with
difficulty
answered
i
afraid
i
can
not
help
you
but
vividly
there
rose
before
him
the
face
he
had
seen
light
up
so
tremulous
and
glad
at
bosinney
coming
of
her
he
thought
more
than
of
his
own
daughter
more
than
of
them
her
with
the
dark
soft
glance
the
delicate
passive
face
waiting
for
the
dead
man
waiting
even
at
that
moment
perhaps
still
and
patient
in
the
sunlight
he
walked
sorrowfully
away
from
the
hospital
towards
his
father
house
reflecting
that
this
death
would
break
up
the
forsyte
family
the
stroke
had
indeed
slipped
past
their
defences
into
the
very
wood
of
their
tree
they
might
flourish
to
all
appearance
as
before
preserving
a
brave
show
before
the
eyes
of
london
but
the
trunk
was
dead
withered
by
the
same
flash
that
had
stricken
down
bosinney
and
now
the
saplings
would
take
its
place
each
one
a
new
custodian
of
the
sense
of
property
good
forest
of
forsytes
thought
young
timber
of
our
land
concerning
the
cause
of
this
family
would
doubtless
reject
with
vigour
the
suspicion
of
suicide
which
was
so
compromising
they
would
take
it
as
an
accident
a
stroke
of
fate
in
their
hearts
they
would
even
feel
it
an
intervention
of
providence
a
not
bosinney
endangered
their
two
most
priceless
possessions
the
pocket
and
the
hearth
and
they
would
talk
of
unfortunate
accident
of
young
bosinney
but
perhaps
they
would
not
might
be
better
as
for
himself
he
regarded
the
account
of
the
accident
as
of
very
little
value
for
no
one
so
madly
in
love
committed
suicide
for
want
of
money
nor
was
bosinney
the
sort
of
fellow
to
set
much
store
by
a
financial
crisis
and
so
he
too
rejected
this
theory
of
suicide
the
dead
man
face
rose
too
clearly
before
him
gone
in
the
heyday
of
his
to
believe
thus
that
an
accident
had
cut
bosinney
off
in
the
full
sweep
of
his
passion
was
more
than
ever
pitiful
to
young
jolyon
then
came
a
vision
of
soames
home
as
it
now
was
and
must
be
hereafter
the
streak
of
lightning
had
flashed
its
clear
uncanny
gleam
on
bare
bones
with
grinning
spaces
between
the
disguising
flesh
was
gone
in
the
at
stanhope
gate
old
jolyon
was
sitting
alone
when
his
son
came
in
he
looked
very
wan
in
his
great
armchair
and
his
eyes
travelling
round
the
walls
with
their
pictures
of
still
life
and
the
masterpiece
at
sunset
seemed
as
though
passing
their
gaze
over
his
life
with
its
hopes
its
gains
its
achievements
ah
jo
he
said
is
that
you
i
told
poor
little
june
but
not
all
of
it
are
you
going
to
soames
she
brought
it
on
herself
i
suppose
but
somehow
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
shut
up
all
and
holding
up
his
thin
veined
hand
he
clenched
it
chapter
return
after
leaving
james
and
old
jolyon
in
the
mortuary
of
the
hospital
soames
hurried
aimlessly
along
the
streets
the
tragic
event
of
bosinney
death
altered
the
complexion
of
everything
there
was
no
longer
the
same
feeling
that
to
lose
a
minute
would
be
fatal
nor
would
he
now
risk
communicating
the
fact
of
his
wife
flight
to
anyone
till
the
inquest
was
over
that
morning
he
had
risen
early
before
the
postman
came
had
taken
the
letters
from
the
box
himself
and
though
there
had
been
none
from
irene
he
had
made
an
opportunity
of
telling
bilson
that
her
mistress
was
at
the
sea
he
would
probably
he
said
be
going
down
himself
from
saturday
to
monday
this
had
given
him
time
to
breathe
time
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
find
her
but
now
cut
off
from
taking
steps
by
bosinney
strange
death
to
think
of
which
was
like
putting
a
hot
iron
to
his
heart
like
lifting
a
great
weight
from
did
not
know
how
to
pass
his
day
and
he
wandered
here
and
there
through
the
streets
looking
at
every
face
he
met
devoured
by
a
hundred
anxieties
and
as
he
wandered
he
thought
of
him
who
had
finished
his
wandering
his
prowling
and
would
never
haunt
his
house
again
already
in
the
afternoon
he
passed
posters
announcing
the
identity
of
the
dead
man
and
bought
the
papers
to
see
what
they
said
he
would
stop
their
mouths
if
he
could
and
he
went
into
the
city
and
was
closeted
with
boulter
for
a
long
time
on
his
way
home
passing
the
steps
of
jobson
about
half
past
four
he
met
george
forsyte
who
held
out
an
evening
paper
to
soames
saying
here
have
you
seen
this
about
the
poor
buccaneer
soames
answered
stonily
george
stared
at
him
he
had
never
liked
soames
he
now
held
him
responsible
for
bosinney
death
soames
had
done
for
for
him
by
that
act
of
property
that
had
sent
the
buccaneer
to
run
amok
that
fatal
afternoon
poor
fellow
he
was
thinking
so
cracked
with
jealousy
so
cracked
for
his
vengeance
that
he
heard
nothing
of
the
omnibus
in
that
infernal
fog
soames
had
done
for
him
and
this
judgment
was
in
george
eyes
they
talk
of
suicide
here
he
said
at
last
that
cat
wo
soames
shook
his
head
an
accident
he
muttered
clenching
his
fist
on
the
paper
george
crammed
it
into
his
pocket
he
could
not
resist
a
parting
shot
all
flourishing
at
home
any
little
soameses
yet
with
a
face
as
white
as
the
steps
of
jobson
and
a
lip
raised
as
if
snarling
soames
brushed
past
him
and
was
gone
on
reaching
home
and
entering
the
little
lighted
hall
with
his
latchkey
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
was
his
umbrella
lying
on
the
rug
chest
flinging
off
his
fur
coat
he
hurried
to
the
the
curtains
were
drawn
for
the
night
a
bright
fire
of
burned
in
the
grate
and
by
its
light
he
saw
irene
sitting
in
her
usual
corner
on
the
sofa
he
shut
the
door
softly
and
went
towards
her
she
did
not
move
and
did
not
seem
to
see
him
so
you
come
back
he
said
why
are
you
sitting
here
in
the
dark
then
he
caught
sight
of
her
face
so
white
and
motionless
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
blood
must
have
stopped
flowing
in
her
veins
and
her
eyes
that
looked
enormous
like
the
great
wide
startled
brown
eyes
of
an
owl
huddled
in
her
grey
fur
against
the
sofa
cushions
she
had
a
strange
resemblance
to
a
captive
owl
bunched
in
its
soft
feathers
against
the
wires
of
a
cage
the
supple
erectness
of
her
figure
was
gone
as
though
she
had
been
broken
by
cruel
exercise
as
though
there
were
no
longer
any
reason
for
being
beautiful
and
supple
and
erect
so
you
come
back
he
repeated
she
never
looked
up
and
never
spoke
the
firelight
playing
over
her
motionless
figure
suddenly
she
tried
to
rise
but
he
prevented
her
it
was
then
that
he
understood
she
had
come
back
like
an
animal
wounded
to
death
not
knowing
where
to
turn
not
knowing
what
she
was
doing
the
sight
of
her
figure
huddled
in
the
fur
was
enough
he
knew
then
for
certain
that
bosinney
had
been
her
lover
knew
that
she
had
seen
the
report
of
his
like
himself
had
bought
a
paper
at
the
draughty
corner
of
a
street
and
read
it
she
had
come
back
then
of
her
own
accord
to
the
cage
she
had
pined
to
be
free
taking
in
all
the
tremendous
significance
of
this
he
longed
to
cry
take
your
hated
body
that
i
love
out
of
my
house
take
away
that
pitiful
white
face
so
cruel
and
i
crush
it
get
out
of
my
sight
never
let
me
see
you
again
and
at
those
unspoken
words
he
seemed
to
see
her
rise
and
move
away
like
a
woman
in
a
terrible
dream
from
which
she
was
fighting
to
and
go
out
into
the
dark
and
cold
without
a
thought
of
him
without
so
much
as
the
knowledge
of
his
presence
then
he
cried
contradicting
what
he
had
not
yet
spoken
no
stay
there
and
turning
away
from
her
he
sat
down
in
his
accustomed
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
they
sat
in
silence
and
soames
thought
is
all
this
why
should
i
suffer
so
what
have
i
done
it
is
not
my
fault
again
he
looked
at
her
huddled
like
a
bird
that
is
shot
and
dying
whose
poor
breast
you
see
panting
as
the
air
is
taken
from
it
whose
poor
eyes
look
at
you
who
have
shot
it
with
a
slow
soft
unseeing
look
taking
farewell
of
all
that
is
the
sun
and
the
air
and
its
mate
so
they
sat
by
the
firelight
in
the
silence
one
on
each
side
of
the
hearth
and
the
fume
of
the
burning
cedar
logs
that
he
loved
so
well
seemed
to
grip
soames
by
the
throat
till
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
going
out
into
the
hall
he
flung
the
door
wide
to
gulp
down
the
cold
air
that
came
in
then
without
hat
or
overcoat
went
out
into
the
square
along
the
garden
rails
a
cat
came
rubbing
her
way
towards
him
and
soames
thought
when
will
it
cease
my
suffering
at
a
front
door
across
the
way
was
a
man
of
his
acquaintance
named
rutter
scraping
his
boots
with
an
air
of
am
master
here
and
soames
walked
on
from
far
in
the
clear
air
the
bells
of
the
church
where
he
and
irene
had
been
married
were
pealing
in
for
the
advent
of
christ
the
chimes
ringing
out
above
the
sound
of
traffic
he
felt
a
craving
for
strong
drink
to
lull
him
to
indifference
or
rouse
him
to
fury
if
only
he
could
burst
out
of
himself
out
of
this
web
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
around
him
if
only
he
could
surrender
to
the
thought
her
out
she
has
forgotten
you
forget
her
if
only
he
could
surrender
to
the
thought
her
has
suffered
enough
if
only
he
could
surrender
to
the
desire
a
slave
of
is
in
your
power
if
only
even
he
could
surrender
to
the
sudden
vision
does
it
all
matter
forget
himself
for
a
minute
forget
that
it
mattered
what
he
did
forget
that
whatever
he
did
he
must
sacrifice
something
if
only
he
could
act
on
an
impulse
he
could
forget
nothing
surrender
to
no
thought
vision
or
desire
it
was
all
too
serious
too
close
around
him
an
unbreakable
cage
on
the
far
side
of
the
square
newspaper
boys
were
calling
their
evening
wares
and
the
ghoulish
cries
mingled
and
jangled
with
the
sound
of
those
church
bells
soames
covered
his
ears
the
thought
flashed
across
him
that
but
for
a
chance
he
himself
and
not
bosinney
might
be
lying
dead
and
she
instead
of
crouching
there
like
a
shot
bird
with
those
dying
eyes
something
soft
touched
his
legs
the
cat
was
rubbing
herself
against
them
and
a
sob
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
burst
from
chest
then
all
was
still
again
in
the
dark
where
the
houses
seemed
to
stare
at
him
each
with
a
master
and
mistress
of
its
own
and
a
secret
story
of
happiness
or
sorrow
and
suddenly
he
saw
that
his
own
door
was
open
and
black
against
the
light
from
the
hall
a
man
standing
with
his
back
turned
something
slid
too
in
his
breast
and
he
stole
up
close
behind
he
could
see
his
own
fur
coat
flung
across
the
carved
oak
chair
the
persian
rugs
the
silver
bowls
the
rows
of
porcelain
plates
arranged
along
the
walls
and
this
unknown
man
who
was
standing
there
and
sharply
he
asked
what
is
it
you
want
sir
the
visitor
turned
it
was
young
jolyon
the
door
was
open
he
said
might
i
see
your
wife
for
a
minute
i
have
a
message
for
her
soames
gave
him
a
strange
sidelong
stare
my
wife
can
see
no
one
he
muttered
doggedly
young
jolyon
answered
gently
i
should
keep
her
a
soames
brushed
by
him
and
barred
the
way
she
can
see
no
one
he
said
again
young
jolyon
glance
shot
past
him
into
the
hall
and
soames
turned
there
in
the
doorway
stood
irene
her
eyes
were
wild
and
eager
her
lips
were
parted
her
hands
outstretched
in
the
sight
of
both
men
that
light
vanished
from
her
face
her
hands
dropped
to
her
sides
she
stood
like
stone
soames
spun
round
and
met
his
visitor
eyes
and
at
the
look
he
saw
in
them
a
sound
like
a
snarl
escaped
him
he
drew
his
lips
back
in
the
ghost
of
a
smile
this
is
my
house
he
said
i
manage
my
own
affairs
i
told
you
tell
you
again
we
are
not
at
and
in
young
jolyon
face
he
slammed
the
door
the
forsyte
ii
by
john
galsworthy
to
andre
chevrillon
indian
summer
of
a
forsyte
and
summer
lease
hath
all
too
short
a
i
in
the
last
day
of
may
in
the
early
about
six
of
the
evening
old
jolyon
forsyte
sat
under
the
oak
tree
below
the
terrace
of
his
house
at
robin
hill
he
was
waiting
for
the
midges
to
bite
him
before
abandoning
the
glory
of
the
afternoon
his
thin
brown
hand
where
blue
veins
stood
out
held
the
end
of
a
cigar
in
its
tapering
pointed
polished
nail
had
survived
with
him
from
those
earlier
victorian
days
when
to
touch
nothing
even
with
the
tips
of
the
fingers
had
been
so
distinguished
his
domed
forehead
great
white
moustache
lean
cheeks
and
long
lean
jaw
were
covered
from
the
westering
sunshine
by
an
old
brown
panama
hat
his
legs
were
crossed
in
all
his
attitude
was
serenity
and
a
kind
of
elegance
as
of
an
old
man
who
every
morning
put
eau
de
cologne
upon
his
silk
handkerchief
at
his
feet
lay
a
woolly
dog
trying
to
be
a
dog
balthasar
between
whom
and
old
jolyon
primal
aversion
had
changed
into
attachment
with
the
years
close
to
his
chair
was
a
swing
and
on
the
swing
was
seated
one
of
holly
her
body
fallen
over
her
legs
and
her
doleful
nose
buried
in
a
black
petticoat
she
was
never
out
of
disgrace
so
it
did
not
matter
to
her
how
she
sat
below
the
oak
tree
the
lawn
dipped
down
a
bank
stretched
to
the
fernery
and
beyond
that
refinement
became
fields
dropping
to
the
pond
the
coppice
and
the
which
swithin
forsyte
from
under
this
very
tree
had
stared
five
years
ago
when
he
drove
down
with
irene
to
look
at
the
house
old
jolyon
had
heard
of
his
brother
drive
which
had
become
quite
celebrated
on
forsyte
swithin
and
the
fellow
had
gone
and
died
last
november
at
the
age
of
only
renewing
the
doubt
whether
forsytes
could
live
for
ever
which
had
first
arisen
when
aunt
ann
passed
away
died
and
left
only
jolyon
and
james
roger
and
nicholas
and
timothy
julia
hester
susan
and
old
jolyon
thought
i
do
feel
when
i
get
that
pain
his
memory
went
searching
he
had
not
felt
his
age
since
he
had
bought
his
nephew
soames
house
and
settled
into
it
here
at
robin
hill
over
three
years
ago
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
getting
younger
every
spring
living
in
the
country
with
his
son
and
his
and
the
little
ones
of
the
second
marriage
jolly
and
holly
living
down
here
out
of
the
racket
of
london
and
the
cackle
of
forsyte
free
of
his
boards
in
a
delicious
atmosphere
of
no
work
and
all
play
with
plenty
of
occupation
in
the
perfecting
and
mellowing
of
the
house
and
its
twenty
acres
and
in
ministering
to
the
whims
of
holly
and
jolly
all
the
knots
and
crankiness
which
had
gathered
in
his
heart
during
that
long
and
tragic
business
of
june
soames
irene
his
wife
and
poor
young
bosinney
had
been
smoothed
out
even
june
had
thrown
off
her
melancholy
at
this
travel
in
spain
she
was
taking
now
with
her
father
and
her
stepmother
curiously
perfect
peace
was
left
by
their
departure
blissful
yet
blank
because
his
son
was
not
there
jo
was
never
anything
but
a
comfort
and
a
pleasure
to
him
amiable
chap
but
women
the
a
little
on
one
nerves
unless
of
course
one
admired
them
a
cuckoo
called
a
was
cooing
from
the
first
in
the
field
and
how
the
daisies
and
buttercups
had
sprung
up
after
the
last
mowing
the
wind
had
got
into
the
sou
west
delicious
air
sappy
he
pushed
his
hat
back
and
let
the
sun
fall
on
his
chin
and
cheek
somehow
he
wanted
a
pretty
face
to
look
at
people
treated
the
old
as
if
they
wanted
nothing
and
with
the
philosophy
which
ever
intruded
on
his
soul
he
thought
never
had
enough
with
a
foot
in
the
grave
one
want
something
i
should
be
surprised
down
from
the
exigencies
of
grandchildren
and
the
flowers
trees
birds
of
his
little
domain
to
say
nothing
of
sun
and
moon
and
stars
above
them
said
sesame
to
him
day
and
night
and
sesame
had
much
perhaps
he
did
not
know
he
had
always
been
responsive
to
what
they
had
begun
to
call
genuinely
almost
religiously
responsive
though
he
had
never
lost
his
habit
of
calling
a
sunset
a
sunset
and
a
view
a
view
however
deeply
they
might
move
him
but
nowadays
nature
actually
made
him
ache
he
appreciated
it
so
every
one
of
these
calm
bright
lengthening
days
with
holly
hand
in
his
and
the
dog
balthasar
in
front
looking
studiously
for
what
he
never
found
he
would
stroll
watching
the
roses
open
fruit
budding
on
the
walls
sunlight
brightening
the
oak
leaves
and
saplings
in
the
coppice
watching
the
leaves
unfold
and
glisten
and
the
silvery
young
corn
of
the
one
wheat
field
listening
to
the
starlings
and
skylarks
and
the
alderney
cows
chewing
the
cud
flicking
slow
their
tufted
tails
and
every
one
of
these
fine
days
he
ached
a
little
from
sheer
love
of
it
all
feeling
perhaps
deep
down
that
he
had
not
very
much
longer
to
enjoy
it
the
thought
that
some
not
ten
years
hence
perhaps
not
this
world
would
be
taken
away
from
him
before
he
had
exhausted
his
powers
of
loving
it
seemed
to
him
in
the
nature
of
an
injustice
brooding
over
his
horizon
if
anything
came
after
this
life
it
would
be
what
he
wanted
not
robin
hill
and
flowers
and
birds
and
pretty
few
even
now
of
those
about
him
with
the
years
his
dislike
of
humbug
had
increased
the
orthodoxy
he
had
worn
in
the
as
he
had
worn
out
of
sheer
exuberance
had
long
dropped
off
leaving
him
reverent
before
three
things
upright
conduct
and
the
sense
of
property
and
the
greatest
of
these
now
was
beauty
he
had
always
had
wide
interests
and
indeed
could
still
read
the
times
but
he
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
put
it
down
if
he
heard
a
blackbird
sing
upright
conduct
they
were
tiring
the
blackbirds
and
the
sunsets
never
tired
him
only
gave
him
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
could
not
get
enough
of
them
staring
into
the
stilly
radiance
of
the
early
evening
and
at
the
little
gold
and
white
flowers
on
the
lawn
a
thought
came
to
him
this
weather
was
like
the
music
of
which
he
had
recently
heard
at
covent
garden
a
beautiful
opera
not
like
meyerbeer
nor
even
quite
mozart
but
in
its
way
perhaps
even
more
lovely
something
classical
and
of
the
golden
age
about
it
chaste
and
mellow
and
the
ravogli
worthy
of
the
old
praise
he
could
bestow
the
yearning
of
orpheus
for
the
beauty
he
was
losing
for
his
love
going
down
to
hades
as
in
life
love
and
beauty
did
yearning
which
sang
and
throbbed
through
the
golden
music
stirred
also
in
the
lingering
beauty
of
the
world
that
evening
and
with
the
tip
of
his
boot
he
involuntarily
stirred
the
ribs
of
the
dog
balthasar
causing
the
animal
to
wake
and
attack
his
fleas
for
though
he
was
supposed
to
have
none
nothing
could
persuade
him
of
the
fact
when
he
had
finished
he
rubbed
the
place
he
had
been
scratching
against
his
master
calf
and
settled
down
again
with
his
chin
over
the
instep
of
the
disturbing
boot
and
into
old
jolyon
mind
came
a
sudden
face
he
had
seen
at
that
opera
three
weeks
the
wife
of
his
precious
nephew
soames
that
man
of
property
though
he
had
not
met
her
since
the
day
of
the
home
in
his
old
house
at
stanhope
gate
which
celebrated
his
granddaughter
june
engagement
to
young
bosinney
he
had
remembered
her
at
once
for
he
had
always
admired
very
pretty
creature
after
the
death
of
young
bosinney
whose
mistress
she
had
so
reprehensibly
become
he
had
heard
that
she
had
left
soames
at
once
goodness
only
knew
what
she
had
been
doing
since
that
sight
of
her
side
the
row
in
front
had
been
literally
the
only
reminder
these
three
years
that
she
was
still
alive
no
one
ever
spoke
of
her
and
yet
jo
had
told
him
something
which
had
upset
him
completely
the
boy
had
got
it
from
george
forsyte
he
believed
who
had
seen
bosinney
in
the
fog
the
day
he
was
run
which
explained
the
young
fellow
act
of
soames
towards
his
shocking
act
jo
had
seen
her
too
that
afternoon
after
the
news
was
out
seen
her
for
a
moment
and
his
description
had
always
lingered
in
old
jolyon
and
lost
he
had
called
her
and
next
day
june
had
gone
up
her
feelings
and
gone
there
and
the
maid
had
cried
and
told
her
how
her
mistress
had
slipped
out
in
the
night
and
vanished
a
tragic
business
altogether
one
thing
was
had
never
been
able
to
lay
hands
on
her
again
and
he
was
living
at
brighton
and
journeying
up
and
fitting
fate
the
man
of
property
for
when
he
once
took
a
dislike
to
he
had
to
his
jolyon
never
got
over
it
he
remembered
still
the
sense
of
relief
with
which
he
had
heard
the
news
of
irene
disappearance
it
had
been
shocking
to
think
of
her
a
prisoner
in
that
house
to
which
she
must
have
wandered
back
when
jo
saw
her
wandered
back
for
a
a
wounded
animal
to
its
hole
after
seeing
that
news
death
of
an
architect
in
the
street
her
face
had
struck
him
very
much
the
other
beautiful
than
he
had
remembered
but
like
a
mask
with
something
going
on
beneath
it
a
young
woman
perhaps
ah
well
very
likely
she
had
another
lover
by
now
but
at
this
subversive
married
women
should
never
love
once
even
had
been
too
instep
rose
and
with
it
the
dog
balthasar
head
the
sagacious
animal
stood
up
and
looked
into
old
jolyon
face
he
seemed
to
say
and
old
jolyon
answered
come
on
old
chap
slowly
as
was
their
wont
they
crossed
among
the
constellations
of
buttercups
and
daisies
and
entered
the
fernery
this
feature
where
very
little
grew
as
yet
had
been
judiciously
dropped
below
the
level
of
the
lawn
so
that
it
might
come
up
again
on
the
level
of
the
other
lawn
and
give
the
impression
of
irregularity
so
important
in
horticulture
its
rocks
and
earth
were
beloved
of
the
dog
balthasar
who
sometimes
found
a
mole
there
old
jolyon
made
a
point
of
passing
through
it
because
though
it
was
not
beautiful
he
intended
that
it
should
be
some
day
and
he
would
think
must
get
varr
to
come
down
and
look
at
it
he
better
than
beech
for
plants
like
houses
and
human
complaints
required
the
best
expert
consideration
it
was
inhabited
by
snails
and
if
accompanied
by
his
grandchildren
he
would
point
to
one
and
tell
them
the
story
of
the
little
boy
who
said
plummers
got
leggers
mother
sonny
darned
if
i
have
been
and
swallowed
a
snileybob
and
when
they
skipped
and
clutched
his
hand
thinking
of
the
snileybob
going
down
the
little
boy
lane
his
eyes
would
twinkle
emerging
from
the
fernery
he
opened
the
wicket
gate
which
just
there
led
into
the
first
field
a
large
and
area
out
of
which
within
brick
walls
the
vegetable
garden
had
been
carved
old
jolyon
avoided
this
which
did
not
suit
his
mood
and
made
down
the
hill
towards
the
pond
balthasar
who
knew
a
or
two
gambolled
in
front
at
the
gait
which
marks
an
oldish
dog
who
takes
the
same
walk
every
day
arrived
at
the
edge
old
jolyon
stood
noting
another
opened
since
yesterday
he
would
show
it
to
holly
when
little
sweet
had
got
over
the
upset
which
had
followed
on
her
eating
a
tomato
at
little
arrangements
were
very
delicate
now
that
jolly
had
gone
to
first
was
with
him
nearly
all
day
long
and
he
missed
her
badly
he
felt
that
pain
too
which
often
bothered
him
now
a
little
dragging
at
his
left
side
he
looked
back
up
the
hill
really
poor
young
bosinney
had
made
an
uncommonly
good
job
of
the
house
he
would
have
done
very
well
for
himself
if
he
had
lived
and
where
was
he
now
perhaps
still
haunting
this
the
site
of
his
last
work
of
his
tragic
love
affair
or
was
philip
bosinney
spirit
diffused
in
the
general
who
could
say
that
dog
was
getting
his
legs
muddy
and
he
moved
towards
the
coppice
there
had
been
the
most
delightful
lot
of
bluebells
and
he
knew
where
some
still
lingered
like
little
patches
of
sky
fallen
in
between
the
trees
away
out
of
the
sun
he
passed
the
and
the
there
installed
and
pursued
a
path
into
the
thick
of
the
saplings
making
for
one
of
the
bluebell
plots
balthasar
preceding
him
once
more
uttered
a
low
growl
old
jolyon
stirred
him
with
his
foot
but
the
dog
remained
motionless
just
where
there
was
no
room
to
pass
and
the
hair
rose
slowly
along
the
centre
of
his
woolly
back
whether
from
the
growl
and
the
look
of
the
dog
stivered
hair
or
from
the
sensation
which
a
man
feels
in
a
wood
old
jolyon
also
felt
something
move
along
his
spine
and
then
the
path
turned
and
there
was
an
old
mossy
log
and
on
it
a
woman
sitting
her
face
was
turned
away
and
he
had
just
time
to
think
must
have
a
board
put
up
before
she
turned
powers
above
the
face
he
had
seen
at
the
very
woman
he
had
just
been
thinking
of
in
that
confused
moment
he
saw
things
blurred
as
if
a
slant
of
sunlight
perhaps
on
her
frock
and
then
she
rose
and
stood
smiling
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
old
jolyon
thought
pretty
she
is
she
did
not
speak
neither
did
he
and
he
realized
why
with
a
certain
admiration
she
was
here
no
doubt
because
of
some
memory
and
did
not
mean
to
try
and
get
out
of
it
by
vulgar
explanation
do
let
that
dog
touch
your
frock
he
said
he
got
wet
feet
come
here
you
but
the
dog
balthasar
went
on
towards
the
visitor
who
put
her
hand
down
and
stroked
his
head
old
jolyon
said
quickly
i
saw
you
at
the
opera
the
other
night
you
did
notice
oh
yes
i
he
felt
a
subtle
flattery
in
that
as
though
she
had
added
you
think
one
could
miss
seeing
you
they
all
in
spain
he
remarked
abruptly
i
alone
i
drove
up
for
the
opera
the
ravogli
good
have
you
seen
the
in
a
situation
so
charged
with
mystery
and
something
very
like
emotion
he
moved
instinctively
towards
that
bit
of
property
and
she
moved
beside
him
her
figure
swayed
faintly
like
the
best
kind
of
french
figures
her
dress
too
was
a
sort
of
french
grey
he
noticed
two
or
three
silver
threads
in
her
hair
strange
hair
with
those
dark
eyes
of
hers
and
that
face
a
sudden
sidelong
look
from
the
velvety
brown
eyes
disturbed
him
it
seemed
to
come
from
deep
and
far
from
another
world
almost
or
at
all
events
from
some
one
not
living
very
much
in
this
and
he
said
mechanically
where
are
you
living
now
i
have
a
little
flat
in
he
did
not
want
to
hear
what
she
was
doing
did
not
want
to
hear
anything
but
the
perverse
word
came
out
alone
she
nodded
it
was
a
relief
to
know
that
and
it
came
into
his
mind
that
but
for
a
twist
of
fate
she
would
have
been
mistress
of
this
coppice
showing
these
to
him
a
visitor
all
alderneys
he
muttered
they
give
the
best
milk
this
one
a
pretty
creature
woa
myrtle
the
cow
with
eyes
as
soft
and
brown
as
irene
own
was
standing
absolutely
still
not
having
long
been
milked
she
looked
round
at
them
out
of
the
corner
of
those
lustrous
mild
cynical
eyes
and
from
her
grey
lips
a
little
dribble
of
saliva
threaded
its
way
towards
the
straw
the
scent
of
hay
and
vanilla
and
ammonia
rose
in
the
dim
light
of
the
cool
and
old
jolyon
said
you
must
come
up
and
have
some
dinner
with
me
i
send
you
home
in
the
he
perceived
a
struggle
going
on
within
her
natural
no
doubt
with
her
memories
but
he
wanted
her
company
a
pretty
face
a
charming
figure
beauty
he
had
been
alone
all
the
afternoon
perhaps
his
eyes
were
wistful
for
she
answered
thank
you
uncle
jolyon
i
should
like
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
said
capital
let
go
up
then
and
preceded
by
the
dog
balthasar
they
ascended
through
the
field
the
sun
was
almost
level
in
their
faces
now
and
he
could
see
not
only
those
silver
threads
but
little
lines
just
deep
enough
to
stamp
her
beauty
with
a
special
look
of
life
unshared
with
others
i
take
her
in
by
the
terrace
he
thought
i
wo
make
a
common
visitor
of
what
do
you
do
all
day
he
said
teach
music
i
have
another
interest
work
said
old
jolyon
picking
up
the
doll
from
off
the
swing
and
smoothing
its
black
petticoat
nothing
like
it
is
there
i
do
do
any
now
i
getting
on
what
interest
is
that
trying
to
help
women
who
come
to
old
jolyon
did
not
quite
understand
to
grief
he
repeated
then
realised
with
a
shock
that
she
meant
exactly
what
he
would
have
meant
himself
if
he
had
used
that
expression
assisting
the
magdalenes
of
london
what
a
weird
and
terrifying
interest
and
curiosity
overcoming
his
natural
shrinking
he
asked
why
what
do
you
do
for
them
not
much
i
no
money
to
spare
i
can
only
give
sympathy
and
food
involuntarily
old
jolyon
hand
sought
his
purse
he
said
hastily
how
get
hold
of
them
i
go
to
a
a
hospital
phew
what
hurts
me
most
is
that
once
they
nearly
all
had
some
sort
of
old
jolyon
straightened
the
doll
beauty
he
ejaculated
ha
yes
a
sad
business
and
he
moved
towards
the
house
through
a
french
window
under
not
yet
drawn
up
he
preceded
her
into
the
room
where
he
was
wont
to
study
the
times
and
the
sheets
of
an
agricultural
magazine
with
huge
illustrations
of
mangold
wurzels
and
the
like
which
provided
holly
with
material
for
her
paint
brush
dinner
in
half
an
hour
you
like
to
wash
your
hands
i
take
you
to
june
he
saw
her
looking
round
eagerly
what
changes
since
she
had
last
visited
this
house
with
her
husband
or
her
lover
or
both
did
not
know
could
not
say
all
that
was
dark
and
he
wished
to
leave
it
so
but
what
changes
and
in
the
hall
he
said
my
boy
jo
a
painter
you
know
he
got
a
lot
of
taste
it
mine
of
course
but
i
let
him
have
his
she
was
standing
very
still
her
eyes
roaming
through
the
hall
and
music
room
as
it
now
thrown
into
one
under
the
great
skylight
old
jolyon
had
an
odd
impression
of
her
was
she
trying
to
conjure
somebody
from
the
shades
of
that
space
where
the
colouring
was
all
and
silver
he
would
have
had
gold
himself
more
lively
and
solid
but
jo
had
french
tastes
and
it
had
come
out
shadowy
like
that
with
an
effect
as
of
the
fume
of
cigarettes
the
chap
was
always
smoking
broken
here
and
there
by
a
little
blaze
of
blue
or
crimson
colour
it
was
not
his
dream
mentally
he
had
hung
this
space
with
those
masterpieces
of
still
and
stiller
life
which
he
had
bought
in
days
when
quantity
was
precious
and
now
where
were
they
sold
for
a
song
that
something
which
made
him
alone
among
forsytes
move
with
the
times
had
warned
him
against
the
struggle
to
retain
them
but
in
his
study
he
still
had
fishing
boats
at
sunset
he
began
to
mount
the
stairs
with
her
slowly
for
he
felt
his
side
these
are
the
bathrooms
he
said
and
other
arrangements
i
had
them
tiled
the
nurseries
are
along
there
and
this
is
jo
and
his
wife
they
all
communicate
but
you
remember
i
irene
nodded
they
passed
on
up
the
gallery
and
entered
a
large
room
with
a
small
bed
and
several
windows
this
is
mine
he
said
the
walls
were
covered
with
the
photographs
of
children
and
watercolour
sketches
and
he
added
doubtfully
these
are
jo
the
view
you
can
see
the
grand
stand
at
epsom
in
clear
the
sun
was
down
now
behind
the
house
and
over
the
a
luminous
haze
had
settled
emanation
of
the
long
and
prosperous
day
few
houses
showed
but
fields
and
trees
faintly
glistened
away
to
a
loom
of
downs
the
country
changing
he
said
abruptly
but
there
it
be
when
we
all
gone
look
at
those
birds
are
sweet
here
in
the
mornings
i
glad
to
have
washed
my
hands
of
her
face
was
close
to
the
window
pane
and
he
was
struck
by
its
mournful
look
i
could
make
her
look
happy
he
thought
pretty
face
but
sad
and
taking
up
his
can
of
hot
water
he
went
out
into
the
gallery
this
is
june
room
he
said
opening
the
next
door
and
putting
the
can
down
i
think
you
find
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
he
went
back
to
his
own
room
brushing
his
hair
with
his
great
ebony
brushes
and
dabbing
his
forehead
with
eau
de
cologne
he
mused
she
had
come
so
sort
of
visitation
mysterious
even
romantic
as
if
his
desire
for
company
for
beauty
had
been
fulfilled
by
whatever
it
was
which
fulfilled
that
sort
of
thing
and
before
the
mirror
he
straightened
his
still
upright
figure
passed
the
brushes
over
his
great
white
moustache
touched
up
his
eyebrows
with
eau
de
cologne
and
rang
the
bell
i
forgot
to
let
them
know
that
i
have
a
lady
to
dinner
with
me
let
cook
do
something
extra
and
tell
beacon
to
have
the
landau
and
pair
at
ten
to
drive
her
back
to
town
is
miss
holly
asleep
the
maid
thought
not
and
old
jolyon
passing
down
the
gallery
stole
on
tiptoe
towards
the
nursery
and
opened
the
door
whose
hinges
he
kept
specially
oiled
that
he
might
slip
in
and
out
in
the
evenings
without
being
heard
but
holly
was
asleep
and
lay
like
a
miniature
madonna
of
that
type
which
the
old
painters
could
not
tell
from
venus
when
they
had
completed
her
her
long
dark
lashes
clung
to
her
cheeks
on
her
face
was
perfect
little
arrangements
were
evidently
all
right
again
and
old
jolyon
in
the
twilight
of
the
room
stood
adoring
her
it
was
so
charming
solemn
and
little
face
he
had
more
than
his
share
of
the
blessed
capacity
of
living
again
in
the
young
they
were
to
him
his
future
of
a
future
life
that
his
fundamental
pagan
sanity
perhaps
admitted
there
she
was
with
everything
before
her
and
his
of
her
tiny
veins
there
she
was
his
little
companion
to
be
made
as
happy
as
ever
he
could
make
her
so
that
she
knew
nothing
but
love
his
heart
swelled
and
he
went
out
stilling
the
sound
of
his
boots
in
the
corridor
an
eccentric
notion
attacked
him
to
think
that
children
should
come
to
that
which
irene
had
told
him
she
was
helping
women
who
were
all
once
little
things
like
this
one
sleeping
there
must
give
her
a
cheque
he
mused
bear
to
think
of
them
they
had
never
borne
reflecting
on
those
poor
outcasts
wounding
too
deeply
the
core
of
true
refinement
hidden
under
layers
of
conformity
to
the
sense
of
too
grievously
the
deepest
thing
in
love
of
beauty
which
could
give
him
even
now
a
flutter
of
the
heart
thinking
of
his
evening
in
the
society
of
a
pretty
woman
and
he
went
downstairs
through
the
swinging
doors
to
the
back
regions
there
in
the
was
a
hock
worth
at
least
two
pounds
a
bottle
a
steinberg
cabinet
better
than
any
johannisberg
that
ever
went
down
throat
a
wine
of
perfect
bouquet
sweet
as
a
indeed
he
got
a
bottle
out
handling
it
like
a
baby
and
holding
it
level
to
the
light
to
look
enshrined
in
its
coat
of
dust
that
mellow
coloured
bottle
gave
him
deep
pleasure
three
years
to
settle
down
again
since
the
move
from
to
be
in
prime
condition
years
ago
he
had
bought
god
he
had
kept
his
palate
and
earned
the
right
to
drink
it
she
would
appreciate
this
not
a
spice
of
acidity
in
a
dozen
he
wiped
the
bottle
drew
the
cork
with
his
own
hands
put
his
nose
down
inhaled
its
perfume
and
went
back
to
the
music
room
irene
was
standing
by
the
piano
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
a
lace
scarf
she
had
been
wearing
so
that
her
hair
was
visible
and
the
pallor
of
her
neck
in
her
grey
frock
she
made
a
pretty
picture
for
old
jolyon
against
the
rosewood
of
the
piano
he
gave
her
his
arm
and
solemnly
they
went
the
room
which
had
been
designed
to
enable
people
to
dine
in
comfort
held
now
but
a
little
round
table
in
his
present
solitude
the
big
oppressed
old
jolyon
he
had
caused
it
to
be
removed
till
his
son
came
back
here
in
the
company
of
two
really
good
copies
of
raphael
madonnas
he
was
wont
to
dine
alone
it
was
the
only
disconsolate
hour
of
his
day
this
summer
weather
he
had
never
been
a
large
eater
like
that
great
chap
swithin
or
sylvanus
heythorp
or
anthony
thornworthy
those
cronies
of
past
times
and
to
dine
alone
overlooked
by
the
madonnas
was
to
him
but
a
sorrowful
occupation
which
he
got
through
quickly
that
he
might
come
to
the
more
spiritual
enjoyment
of
his
coffee
and
cigar
but
this
evening
was
a
different
matter
his
eyes
twinkled
at
her
across
the
little
table
and
he
spoke
of
italy
and
switzerland
telling
her
stories
of
his
travels
there
and
other
experiences
which
he
could
no
longer
recount
to
his
son
and
because
they
knew
them
this
fresh
audience
was
precious
to
him
he
had
never
become
one
of
those
old
men
who
ramble
round
and
round
the
fields
of
reminiscence
himself
quickly
fatigued
by
the
insensitive
he
instinctively
avoided
fatiguing
others
and
his
natural
flirtatiousness
towards
beauty
guarded
him
specially
in
his
relations
with
a
woman
he
would
have
liked
to
draw
her
out
but
though
she
murmured
and
smiled
and
seemed
to
be
enjoying
what
he
told
her
he
remained
conscious
of
that
mysterious
remoteness
which
constituted
half
her
fascination
he
could
not
bear
women
who
threw
their
shoulders
and
eyes
at
you
and
chattered
away
or
women
who
laid
down
the
law
and
knew
more
than
you
did
there
was
only
one
quality
in
a
woman
that
appealed
to
and
the
quieter
it
was
the
more
he
liked
it
and
this
one
had
charm
shadowy
as
afternoon
sunlight
on
those
italian
hills
and
valleys
he
had
loved
the
feeling
too
that
she
was
as
it
were
apart
cloistered
made
her
seem
nearer
to
himself
a
strangely
desirable
companion
when
a
man
is
very
old
and
quite
out
of
the
running
he
loves
to
feel
secure
from
the
rivalries
of
youth
for
he
would
still
be
first
in
the
heart
of
beauty
and
he
drank
his
hock
and
watched
her
lips
and
felt
nearly
young
but
the
dog
balthasar
lay
watching
her
lips
too
and
despising
in
his
heart
the
interruptions
of
their
talk
and
the
tilting
of
those
greenish
glasses
full
of
a
golden
fluid
which
was
distasteful
to
him
the
light
was
just
failing
when
they
went
back
into
the
and
cigar
in
mouth
old
jolyon
said
play
me
some
by
the
cigars
they
smoke
and
the
composers
they
love
ye
shall
know
the
texture
of
men
souls
old
jolyon
could
not
bear
a
strong
cigar
or
wagner
music
he
loved
beethoven
and
mozart
handel
and
gluck
and
schumann
and
for
some
occult
reason
the
operas
of
meyerbeer
but
of
late
years
he
had
been
seduced
by
chopin
just
as
in
painting
he
had
succumbed
to
botticelli
in
yielding
to
these
tastes
he
had
been
conscious
of
divergence
from
the
standard
of
the
golden
age
their
poetry
was
not
that
of
milton
and
byron
and
tennyson
of
raphael
and
titian
mozart
and
beethoven
it
was
as
it
were
behind
a
veil
their
poetry
hit
no
one
in
the
face
but
slipped
its
fingers
under
the
ribs
and
turned
and
twisted
and
melted
up
the
heart
and
never
certain
that
this
was
healthy
he
did
not
care
a
rap
so
long
as
he
could
see
the
pictures
of
the
one
or
hear
the
music
of
the
other
irene
sat
down
at
the
piano
under
the
electric
lamp
festooned
with
and
old
jolyon
in
an
armchair
whence
he
could
see
her
crossed
his
legs
and
drew
slowly
at
his
cigar
she
sat
a
few
moments
with
her
hands
on
the
keys
evidently
searching
her
mind
for
what
to
give
him
then
she
began
and
within
old
jolyon
there
arose
a
sorrowful
pleasure
not
quite
like
anything
else
in
the
world
he
fell
slowly
into
a
trance
interrupted
only
by
the
movements
of
taking
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
at
long
intervals
and
replacing
it
she
was
there
and
the
hock
within
him
and
the
scent
of
tobacco
but
there
too
was
a
world
of
sunshine
lingering
into
moonlight
and
pools
with
storks
upon
them
and
bluish
trees
above
glowing
with
blurs
of
roses
and
fields
of
lavender
where
cows
were
grazing
and
a
woman
all
shadowy
with
dark
eyes
and
a
white
neck
smiled
holding
out
her
arms
and
through
air
which
was
like
music
a
star
dropped
and
was
caught
on
a
cow
horn
he
opened
his
eyes
beautiful
piece
she
played
touch
of
an
angel
and
he
closed
them
again
he
felt
miraculously
sad
and
happy
as
one
does
standing
under
a
in
full
honey
flower
not
live
one
own
life
again
but
just
stand
there
and
bask
in
the
smile
of
a
woman
eyes
and
enjoy
the
bouquet
and
he
jerked
his
hand
the
dog
balthasar
had
reached
up
and
licked
it
beautiful
he
said
go
chopin
she
began
to
play
again
this
time
the
resemblance
between
her
and
struck
him
the
swaying
he
had
noticed
in
her
walk
was
in
her
playing
too
and
the
nocturne
she
had
chosen
and
the
soft
darkness
of
her
eyes
the
light
on
her
hair
as
of
moonlight
from
a
golden
moon
seductive
yes
but
nothing
of
delilah
in
her
or
in
that
music
a
long
blue
spiral
from
his
cigar
ascended
and
dispersed
we
go
out
he
thought
more
beauty
nothing
again
irene
stopped
would
you
like
some
gluck
he
used
to
write
his
music
in
a
sunlit
garden
with
a
bottle
of
rhine
wine
beside
ah
yes
let
have
round
about
him
now
were
fields
of
gold
and
silver
flowers
white
forms
swaying
in
the
sunlight
bright
birds
flying
to
and
fro
all
was
summer
lingering
waves
of
sweetness
and
regret
flooded
his
soul
some
cigar
ash
dropped
and
taking
out
a
silk
handkerchief
to
brush
it
off
he
inhaled
a
mingled
scent
as
of
snuff
and
eau
de
cologne
he
thought
all
and
he
said
you
have
played
me
faro
she
did
not
answer
did
not
move
he
was
conscious
of
strange
upset
suddenly
he
saw
her
rise
and
turn
away
and
a
pang
of
remorse
shot
through
him
what
a
clumsy
chap
like
orpheus
she
of
too
was
looking
for
her
lost
one
in
the
hall
of
memory
and
disturbed
to
the
heart
he
got
up
from
his
chair
she
had
gone
to
the
great
window
at
the
far
end
gingerly
he
followed
her
hands
were
folded
over
her
breast
he
could
just
see
her
cheek
very
white
and
quite
emotionalized
he
said
there
there
my
love
the
words
had
escaped
him
mechanically
for
they
were
those
he
used
to
holly
when
she
had
a
pain
but
their
effect
was
instantaneously
distressing
she
raised
her
arms
covered
her
face
with
them
and
wept
old
jolyon
stood
gazing
at
her
with
eyes
very
deep
from
age
the
passionate
shame
she
seemed
feeling
at
her
abandonment
so
unlike
the
control
and
quietude
of
her
whole
presence
was
as
if
she
had
never
before
broken
down
in
the
presence
of
another
being
there
there
he
murmured
and
putting
his
hand
out
reverently
touched
her
she
turned
and
leaned
the
arms
which
covered
her
face
against
him
old
jolyon
stood
very
still
keeping
one
thin
hand
on
her
shoulder
let
her
cry
her
heart
would
do
her
good
and
the
dog
balthasar
puzzled
sat
down
on
his
stern
to
examine
them
the
window
was
still
open
the
curtains
had
not
been
drawn
the
last
of
daylight
from
without
mingled
with
faint
intrusion
from
the
lamp
within
there
was
a
scent
of
grass
with
the
wisdom
of
a
long
life
old
jolyon
did
not
speak
even
grief
sobbed
itself
out
in
time
only
time
was
good
for
who
saw
the
passing
of
each
mood
each
emotion
in
turn
time
the
there
came
into
his
mind
the
words
panteth
the
hart
after
cooling
they
were
of
no
use
to
him
then
conscious
of
a
scent
of
violets
he
knew
she
was
drying
her
eyes
he
put
his
chin
forward
pressed
his
moustache
against
her
forehead
and
felt
her
shake
with
a
quivering
of
her
whole
body
as
of
a
tree
which
shakes
itself
free
of
raindrops
she
put
his
hand
to
her
lips
as
if
saying
all
over
now
forgive
me
the
kiss
filled
him
with
a
strange
comfort
he
led
her
back
to
where
she
had
been
so
upset
and
the
dog
balthasar
following
laid
the
bone
of
one
of
the
cutlets
they
had
eaten
at
their
feet
anxious
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
that
emotion
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
china
and
moving
with
her
slowly
from
cabinet
to
cabinet
he
kept
taking
up
bits
of
dresden
and
lowestoft
and
chelsea
turning
them
round
and
round
with
his
thin
veined
hands
whose
skin
faintly
freckled
had
such
an
aged
look
i
bought
this
at
jobson
he
would
say
cost
me
thirty
pounds
it
very
old
that
dog
leaves
his
bones
all
over
the
place
this
old
i
picked
up
at
the
sale
when
that
precious
rip
the
marquis
came
to
grief
but
you
do
remember
here
a
nice
piece
of
chelsea
now
what
would
you
say
this
was
and
he
was
comforted
feeling
that
with
her
taste
she
was
taking
a
real
interest
in
these
things
for
after
all
nothing
better
composes
the
nerves
than
a
doubtful
piece
of
china
when
the
crunch
of
the
carriage
wheels
was
heard
at
last
he
said
you
must
come
again
you
must
come
to
lunch
then
i
can
show
you
these
by
daylight
and
my
little
a
dear
little
thing
this
dog
seems
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
for
balthasar
feeling
that
she
was
about
to
leave
was
rubbing
his
side
against
her
leg
going
out
under
the
porch
with
her
he
said
he
get
you
up
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
take
this
for
your
protegees
and
he
slipped
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
into
her
hand
he
saw
her
brightened
eyes
and
heard
her
murmur
oh
uncle
jolyon
and
a
real
throb
of
pleasure
went
through
him
that
meant
one
or
two
poor
creatures
helped
a
little
and
it
meant
that
she
would
come
again
he
put
his
hand
in
at
the
window
and
grasped
hers
once
more
the
carriage
rolled
away
he
stood
looking
at
the
moon
and
the
shadows
of
the
trees
and
thought
sweet
night
she
ii
two
days
of
rain
and
summer
set
in
bland
and
sunny
old
jolyon
walked
and
talked
with
holly
at
first
he
felt
taller
and
full
of
a
new
vigour
then
he
felt
restless
almost
every
afternoon
they
would
enter
the
coppice
and
walk
as
far
as
the
log
she
not
there
he
would
think
course
not
and
he
would
feel
a
little
shorter
and
drag
his
feet
walking
up
the
hill
home
with
his
hand
clapped
to
his
left
side
now
and
then
the
thought
would
move
in
him
she
did
i
dream
it
and
he
would
stare
at
space
while
the
dog
balthasar
stared
at
him
of
course
she
would
not
come
again
he
opened
the
letters
from
spain
with
less
excitement
they
were
not
returning
till
july
he
felt
oddly
that
he
could
bear
it
every
day
at
dinner
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
looked
at
where
she
had
sat
she
was
not
there
so
he
unscrewed
his
eyes
again
on
the
seventh
afternoon
he
thought
must
go
up
and
get
some
boots
he
ordered
beacon
and
set
out
passing
from
putney
towards
hyde
park
he
reflected
might
as
well
go
to
chelsea
and
see
her
and
he
called
out
just
drive
me
to
where
you
took
that
lady
the
other
the
coachman
turned
his
broad
red
face
and
his
juicy
lips
answered
the
lady
in
grey
sir
yes
the
lady
in
what
other
ladies
were
there
stodgy
chap
the
carriage
stopped
before
a
small
block
of
flats
standing
a
little
back
from
the
river
with
a
practised
eye
old
jolyon
saw
that
they
were
cheap
should
think
about
sixty
pound
a
year
he
mused
and
entering
he
looked
at
the
the
name
was
not
on
it
but
against
floor
flat
c
were
the
words
irene
heron
ah
she
had
taken
her
maiden
name
again
and
somehow
this
pleased
him
he
went
upstairs
slowly
feeling
his
side
a
little
he
stood
a
moment
before
ringing
to
lose
the
feeling
of
drag
and
fluttering
there
she
would
not
be
in
and
the
thought
was
black
what
did
he
want
with
boots
at
his
age
he
could
not
wear
out
all
those
he
had
your
mistress
at
home
yes
say
jolyon
yes
sir
will
you
come
this
way
old
jolyon
followed
a
very
little
more
than
sixteen
one
would
a
very
small
where
the
were
drawn
it
held
a
cottage
piano
and
little
else
save
a
vague
fragrance
and
good
taste
he
stood
in
the
middle
with
his
top
hat
in
his
hand
and
thought
expect
she
very
badly
off
there
was
a
mirror
above
the
fireplace
and
he
saw
himself
reflected
an
chap
he
heard
a
rustle
and
turned
round
she
was
so
close
that
his
moustache
almost
brushed
her
forehead
just
under
her
hair
i
was
driving
up
he
said
thought
i
look
in
on
you
and
ask
you
how
you
got
up
the
other
and
seeing
her
smile
he
felt
suddenly
relieved
she
was
really
glad
to
see
him
perhaps
would
you
like
to
put
on
your
hat
and
come
for
a
drive
in
the
park
but
while
she
was
gone
to
put
her
hat
on
he
frowned
the
park
james
and
emily
nicholas
or
some
other
member
of
his
precious
family
would
be
there
very
likely
prancing
up
and
down
and
they
would
go
and
wag
their
tongues
about
having
seen
him
with
her
afterwards
better
not
he
did
not
wish
to
revive
the
echoes
of
the
past
on
forsyte
he
removed
a
white
hair
from
the
lapel
of
his
frock
coat
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
cheeks
moustache
and
square
chin
it
felt
very
hollow
there
under
the
cheekbones
he
had
not
been
eating
much
had
better
get
that
little
whippersnapper
who
attended
holly
to
give
him
a
tonic
but
she
had
come
back
and
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
he
said
suppose
we
go
and
sit
in
kensington
gardens
instead
and
added
with
a
twinkle
no
prancing
up
and
down
there
as
if
she
had
been
in
the
secret
of
his
thoughts
leaving
the
carriage
they
entered
those
select
precincts
and
strolled
towards
the
water
you
gone
back
to
your
maiden
name
i
see
he
said
i
not
she
slipped
her
hand
under
his
arm
has
june
forgiven
me
uncle
jolyon
he
answered
gently
of
course
why
not
and
have
you
i
i
forgave
you
as
soon
as
i
saw
how
the
land
really
and
perhaps
he
had
his
instinct
had
always
been
to
forgive
the
beautiful
she
drew
a
deep
breath
i
never
could
did
you
ever
love
very
deeply
uncle
jolyon
at
that
strange
question
old
jolyon
stared
before
him
had
he
he
did
not
seem
to
remember
that
he
ever
had
but
he
did
not
like
to
say
this
to
the
young
woman
whose
hand
was
touching
his
arm
whose
life
was
suspended
as
it
were
by
memory
of
a
tragic
love
and
he
thought
i
had
met
you
when
i
was
young
might
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
perhaps
and
a
longing
to
escape
in
generalities
beset
him
love
a
queer
thing
he
said
fatal
thing
often
it
was
the
it
love
into
a
goddess
they
were
right
i
dare
say
but
then
they
lived
in
the
golden
phil
adored
phil
the
word
jarred
him
for
his
power
to
see
all
round
a
thing
he
perceived
why
she
was
putting
up
with
him
like
this
she
wanted
to
talk
about
her
lover
well
if
it
was
any
pleasure
to
her
and
he
said
ah
there
was
a
bit
of
the
sculptor
in
him
i
yes
he
loved
balance
and
symmetry
he
loved
the
way
the
greeks
gave
themselves
to
balance
the
chap
had
no
balance
at
all
if
he
remembered
as
for
enough
he
was
no
doubt
but
those
queer
eyes
of
his
and
high
you
of
the
golden
age
too
uncle
old
jolyon
looked
round
at
her
was
she
chaffing
him
no
her
eyes
were
soft
as
velvet
was
she
flattering
him
but
if
so
why
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
out
of
an
old
chap
like
him
phil
thought
so
he
used
to
say
i
can
never
tell
him
that
i
admire
him
ah
there
it
was
again
her
dead
lover
her
desire
to
talk
of
him
and
he
pressed
her
arm
half
resentful
of
those
memories
half
grateful
as
if
he
recognised
what
a
link
they
were
between
herself
and
him
he
was
a
very
talented
young
fellow
he
murmured
it
hot
i
feel
the
heat
nowadays
let
sit
they
took
two
chairs
beneath
a
chestnut
tree
whose
broad
leaves
covered
them
from
the
peaceful
glory
of
the
afternoon
a
pleasure
to
sit
there
and
watch
her
and
feel
that
she
liked
to
be
with
him
and
the
wish
to
increase
that
liking
if
he
could
made
him
go
on
i
expect
he
showed
you
a
side
of
him
i
never
saw
he
be
at
his
best
with
you
his
ideas
of
art
were
a
little
me
had
stiffed
the
word
yes
but
he
used
to
say
you
had
a
real
sense
of
old
jolyon
thought
devil
he
did
but
answered
with
a
twinkle
well
i
have
or
i
should
be
sitting
here
with
she
was
fascinating
when
she
smiled
with
her
eyes
like
that
he
thought
you
had
one
of
those
hearts
that
never
grow
old
phil
had
real
he
was
not
taken
in
by
this
flattery
spoken
out
of
the
past
out
of
a
longing
to
talk
of
her
dead
a
bit
and
yet
it
was
precious
to
hear
because
she
pleased
his
eyes
and
heart
true
never
grown
old
was
that
her
and
her
dead
lover
he
had
never
loved
to
desperation
had
always
kept
his
balance
his
sense
of
symmetry
well
it
had
left
him
power
at
to
admire
beauty
and
he
thought
i
were
a
painter
or
a
sculptor
but
i
an
old
chap
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
a
couple
with
arms
entwined
crossed
on
the
grass
before
them
at
the
edge
of
the
shadow
from
their
tree
the
sunlight
fell
cruelly
on
their
pale
squashed
unkempt
young
faces
we
an
ugly
lot
said
old
jolyon
suddenly
it
amazes
me
to
see
triumphs
over
love
triumphs
over
everything
the
young
think
so
he
muttered
love
has
no
age
no
limit
and
no
with
that
glow
in
her
pale
face
her
breast
heaving
her
eyes
so
large
and
dark
and
soft
she
looked
like
venus
come
to
life
but
this
extravagance
brought
instant
reaction
and
twinkling
he
said
well
if
it
had
limits
we
should
be
born
for
by
george
it
got
a
lot
to
put
up
then
removing
his
top
hat
he
brushed
it
round
with
a
cuff
the
great
clumsy
thing
heated
his
forehead
in
these
days
he
often
got
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
circulation
was
not
what
it
had
been
she
still
sat
gazing
straight
before
her
and
suddenly
she
murmured
it
strange
enough
that
i
those
words
of
jo
and
lost
came
back
to
him
ah
he
said
my
son
saw
you
for
a
was
it
your
son
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
hall
i
thought
for
a
second
it
old
jolyon
saw
her
lips
tremble
she
put
her
hand
over
them
took
it
away
again
and
went
on
calmly
that
night
i
went
to
the
embankment
a
woman
caught
me
by
the
dress
she
told
me
about
herself
when
one
knows
that
others
suffer
one
one
of
those
she
nodded
and
horror
stirred
within
old
jolyon
the
horror
of
one
who
has
never
known
a
struggle
with
desperation
almost
against
his
will
he
muttered
tell
me
wo
you
i
did
care
whether
i
lived
or
died
when
you
like
that
fate
ceases
to
want
to
kill
you
she
took
care
of
me
three
never
left
me
i
had
no
money
that
why
i
do
what
i
can
for
them
but
old
jolyon
was
thinking
money
what
fate
could
compare
with
that
every
other
was
involved
in
it
i
wish
you
had
come
to
me
he
said
why
did
you
but
irene
did
not
answer
because
my
name
was
forsyte
i
suppose
or
was
it
june
who
kept
you
away
how
are
you
getting
on
now
his
eyes
involuntarily
swept
her
body
perhaps
even
now
she
and
yet
she
was
really
oh
with
my
fifty
pounds
a
year
i
make
just
the
answer
did
not
reassure
him
he
had
lost
confidence
and
that
fellow
soames
but
his
sense
of
justice
stifled
condemnation
no
she
would
certainly
have
died
rather
than
take
another
penny
from
him
soft
as
she
looked
there
must
be
strength
in
her
and
fidelity
but
what
business
had
young
bosinney
to
have
got
run
over
and
left
her
stranded
like
this
well
you
must
come
to
me
now
he
said
for
anything
you
want
or
i
shall
be
quite
cut
and
putting
on
his
hat
he
rose
let
go
and
get
some
tea
i
told
that
lazy
chap
to
put
the
horses
up
for
an
hour
and
come
for
me
at
your
place
we
take
a
cab
presently
i
ca
walk
as
i
used
he
enjoyed
that
stroll
to
the
kensington
end
of
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
glancing
of
her
eyes
the
subtle
beauty
of
a
charming
form
moving
beside
him
he
enjoyed
their
tea
at
ruffel
in
the
high
street
and
came
out
thence
with
a
great
box
of
chocolates
swung
on
his
little
finger
he
enjoyed
the
drive
back
to
chelsea
in
a
hansom
smoking
his
cigar
she
had
promised
to
come
down
next
sunday
and
play
to
him
again
and
already
in
thought
he
was
plucking
carnations
and
early
roses
for
her
to
carry
back
to
town
it
was
a
pleasure
to
give
her
a
little
pleasure
if
it
were
pleasure
from
an
old
chap
like
him
the
carriage
was
already
there
when
they
arrived
just
like
that
fellow
who
was
always
late
when
he
was
wanted
old
jolyon
went
in
for
a
minute
to
say
the
little
dark
hall
of
the
flat
was
impregnated
with
a
disagreeable
odour
of
patchouli
and
on
a
bench
against
the
only
saw
a
figure
sitting
he
heard
irene
say
softly
just
one
in
the
little
when
the
door
was
shut
he
asked
gravely
one
of
your
protegees
yes
now
thanks
to
you
i
can
do
something
for
he
stood
staring
and
stroking
that
chin
whose
strength
had
frightened
so
many
in
its
time
the
idea
of
her
thus
actually
in
contact
with
this
outcast
grieved
and
frightened
him
what
could
she
do
for
them
nothing
only
soil
and
make
trouble
for
herself
perhaps
and
he
said
take
care
my
dear
the
world
puts
the
worst
construction
on
i
know
he
was
abashed
by
her
quiet
smile
well
he
murmured
she
put
her
cheek
forward
for
him
to
kiss
he
said
again
take
care
of
and
he
went
out
not
looking
towards
the
figure
on
the
bench
he
drove
home
by
way
of
hammersmith
that
he
might
stop
at
a
place
he
knew
of
and
tell
them
to
send
her
in
two
dozen
of
their
best
burgundy
she
must
want
sometimes
only
in
richmond
park
did
he
remember
that
he
had
gone
up
to
order
himself
some
boots
and
was
surprised
that
he
could
have
had
so
paltry
an
idea
iii
the
little
spirits
of
the
past
which
throng
an
old
man
days
had
never
pushed
their
faces
up
to
his
so
seldom
as
in
the
seventy
hours
elapsing
before
sunday
came
the
spirit
of
the
future
with
the
charm
of
the
unknown
put
up
her
lips
instead
old
jolyon
was
not
restless
now
and
paid
no
visits
to
the
log
because
she
was
coming
to
lunch
there
is
wonderful
finality
about
a
meal
it
removes
a
world
of
doubts
for
no
one
misses
meals
except
for
reasons
beyond
control
he
played
many
games
with
holly
on
the
lawn
pitching
them
up
to
her
who
was
batting
so
as
to
be
ready
to
bowl
to
jolly
in
the
holidays
for
she
was
not
a
forsyte
but
jolly
forsytes
always
bat
until
they
have
resigned
and
reached
the
age
of
the
dog
balthasar
in
attendance
lay
on
the
ball
as
often
as
he
could
and
the
fielded
till
his
face
was
like
the
harvest
moon
and
because
the
time
was
getting
shorter
each
day
was
longer
and
more
golden
than
the
last
on
friday
night
he
took
a
liver
pill
his
side
hurt
him
rather
and
though
it
was
not
the
liver
side
there
is
no
remedy
like
that
anyone
telling
him
that
he
had
found
a
new
excitement
in
life
and
that
excitement
was
not
good
for
him
would
have
been
met
by
one
of
those
steady
and
rather
defiant
looks
of
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
say
know
my
own
business
best
he
always
had
and
always
would
on
sunday
morning
when
holly
had
gone
with
her
governess
to
church
he
visited
the
strawberry
beds
there
accompanied
by
the
dog
balthasar
he
examined
the
plants
narrowly
and
succeeded
in
finding
at
least
two
dozen
berries
which
were
really
ripe
stooping
was
not
good
for
him
and
he
became
very
dizzy
and
red
in
the
forehead
having
placed
the
strawberries
in
a
dish
on
the
he
washed
his
hands
and
bathed
his
forehead
with
eau
de
cologne
there
before
the
mirror
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
thinner
what
a
he
had
been
when
he
was
young
it
was
nice
to
be
could
not
bear
a
fat
chap
and
yet
perhaps
his
cheeks
were
too
thin
she
was
to
arrive
by
train
at
twelve
and
walk
up
entering
from
the
road
past
drage
farm
at
the
far
end
of
the
coppice
and
having
looked
into
june
room
to
see
that
there
was
hot
water
ready
he
set
forth
to
meet
her
leisurely
for
his
heart
was
beating
the
air
smelled
sweet
larks
sang
and
the
grand
stand
at
epsom
was
visible
a
perfect
day
on
just
such
a
one
no
doubt
six
years
ago
soames
had
brought
young
bosinney
down
with
him
to
look
at
the
site
before
they
began
to
build
it
was
bosinney
who
had
pitched
on
the
exact
spot
for
the
june
had
often
told
him
in
these
days
he
was
thinking
much
about
that
young
fellow
as
if
his
spirit
were
really
haunting
the
field
of
his
last
work
on
the
chance
of
one
man
who
had
possessed
her
heart
to
whom
she
had
given
her
whole
self
with
rapture
at
his
age
one
could
not
of
course
imagine
such
things
but
there
stirred
in
him
a
queer
vague
it
were
the
ghost
of
an
impersonal
jealousy
and
a
feeling
too
more
generous
of
pity
for
that
love
so
early
lost
all
over
in
a
few
poor
months
well
well
he
looked
at
his
watch
before
entering
the
a
quarter
past
minutes
to
wait
and
then
turning
the
corner
of
the
path
he
saw
her
exactly
where
he
had
seen
her
the
first
time
on
the
log
and
realised
that
she
must
have
come
by
the
earlier
train
to
sit
there
alone
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
two
hours
of
her
society
missed
what
memory
could
make
that
log
so
dear
to
her
his
face
showed
what
he
was
thinking
for
she
said
at
once
forgive
me
uncle
jolyon
it
was
here
that
i
first
yes
yes
there
it
is
for
you
whenever
you
like
you
looking
a
little
londony
you
giving
too
many
that
she
should
have
to
give
lessons
worried
him
lessons
to
a
parcel
of
young
girls
thumping
out
scales
with
their
thick
fingers
where
do
you
go
to
give
them
he
asked
they
mostly
jewish
families
old
jolyon
stared
to
all
forsytes
jews
seem
strange
and
doubtful
they
love
music
and
they
very
they
had
better
be
by
george
he
took
her
side
always
hurt
him
a
little
going
said
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
those
buttercups
they
came
like
that
in
a
her
eyes
seemed
really
to
fly
over
the
field
like
bees
after
the
flowers
and
the
honey
i
wanted
you
to
see
let
them
turn
the
cows
in
then
remembering
that
she
had
come
to
talk
about
bosinney
he
pointed
to
the
over
the
stables
i
expect
he
would
have
let
me
put
that
no
notion
of
time
if
i
but
pressing
his
arm
to
her
she
talked
of
flowers
instead
and
he
knew
it
was
done
that
he
might
not
feel
she
came
because
of
her
dead
lover
the
best
flower
i
can
show
you
he
said
with
a
sort
of
triumph
is
my
little
sweet
she
be
back
from
church
directly
there
something
about
her
which
reminds
me
a
little
of
you
and
it
did
not
seem
to
him
peculiar
that
he
had
put
it
thus
instead
of
saying
there
something
about
you
which
reminds
me
a
little
of
ah
and
here
she
was
holly
followed
closely
by
her
elderly
french
governess
whose
digestion
had
been
ruined
years
ago
in
the
siege
of
strasbourg
came
rushing
towards
them
from
under
the
oak
tree
she
stopped
about
a
dozen
yards
away
to
pat
balthasar
and
pretend
that
this
was
all
she
had
in
her
mind
old
jolyon
who
knew
better
said
well
my
darling
here
the
lady
in
grey
i
promised
holly
raised
herself
and
looked
up
he
watched
the
two
of
them
with
a
twinkle
irene
smiling
holly
beginning
with
grave
inquiry
passing
into
a
shy
smile
too
and
then
to
something
deeper
she
had
a
sense
of
beauty
that
what
was
what
he
enjoyed
the
sight
of
the
kiss
between
them
mrs
heron
beauce
well
sermon
for
now
that
he
had
not
much
more
time
before
him
the
only
part
of
the
service
connected
with
this
world
absorbed
what
interest
in
church
remained
to
him
beauce
stretched
out
a
spidery
hand
clad
in
a
black
kid
had
been
in
the
best
the
rather
sad
eyes
of
her
lean
yellowish
face
seemed
to
ask
are
you
whenever
holly
or
jolly
did
anything
unpleasing
to
not
uncommon
would
say
to
them
the
little
tayleurs
never
did
were
such
little
jolly
hated
the
little
tayleurs
holly
wondered
dreadfully
how
it
was
she
fell
so
short
of
them
thin
rum
little
soul
old
jolyon
thought
beauce
luncheon
was
a
successful
meal
the
mushrooms
which
he
himself
had
picked
in
the
mushroom
house
his
chosen
strawberries
and
another
bottle
of
the
steinberg
cabinet
filled
him
with
a
certain
aromatic
spirituality
and
a
conviction
that
he
would
have
a
touch
of
eczema
after
lunch
they
sat
under
the
oak
tree
drinking
turkish
coffee
it
was
no
matter
of
grief
to
him
when
mademoiselle
beauce
withdrew
to
write
her
sunday
letter
to
her
sister
whose
future
had
been
endangered
in
the
past
by
swallowing
a
event
held
up
daily
in
warning
to
the
children
to
eat
slowly
and
digest
what
they
had
eaten
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
on
a
carriage
rug
holly
and
the
dog
balthasar
teased
and
loved
each
other
and
in
the
shade
old
jolyon
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
cigar
luxuriously
savoured
gazed
at
irene
sitting
in
the
swing
a
light
vaguely
swaying
grey
figure
with
a
fleck
of
sunlight
here
and
there
upon
it
lips
just
opened
eyes
dark
and
soft
under
lids
a
little
drooped
she
looked
content
surely
it
did
her
good
to
come
and
see
him
the
selfishness
of
age
had
not
set
its
proper
grip
on
him
for
he
could
still
feel
pleasure
in
the
pleasure
of
others
realising
that
what
he
wanted
though
much
was
not
quite
all
that
mattered
it
quiet
here
he
said
you
must
come
down
if
you
find
it
dull
but
it
a
pleasure
to
see
you
my
little
sweet
is
the
only
face
which
gives
me
any
pleasure
except
from
her
smile
he
knew
that
she
was
not
beyond
liking
to
be
appreciated
and
this
reassured
him
that
not
humbug
he
said
i
never
told
a
woman
i
admired
her
when
i
did
in
fact
i
do
know
when
i
told
a
woman
i
admired
her
except
my
wife
in
the
old
days
and
wives
are
he
was
silent
but
resumed
abruptly
she
used
to
expect
me
to
say
it
more
often
than
i
felt
it
and
there
we
her
face
looked
mysteriously
troubled
and
afraid
that
he
had
said
something
painful
he
hurried
on
when
my
little
sweet
marries
i
hope
she
find
someone
who
knows
what
women
feel
i
sha
be
here
to
see
it
but
there
too
much
in
marriage
i
do
want
her
to
pitch
up
against
and
aware
that
he
had
made
bad
worse
he
added
that
dog
will
a
silence
followed
of
what
was
she
thinking
this
pretty
creature
whose
life
was
spoiled
who
had
done
with
love
and
yet
was
made
for
love
some
day
when
he
was
gone
perhaps
she
would
find
another
so
disorderly
as
that
young
fellow
who
had
got
himself
run
over
ah
but
her
husband
does
soames
never
trouble
you
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
her
face
had
closed
up
suddenly
for
all
her
softness
there
was
something
irreconcilable
about
her
and
a
glimpse
of
light
on
the
inexorable
nature
of
sex
antipathies
strayed
into
a
brain
which
belonging
to
early
victorian
much
older
than
this
of
his
old
never
thought
about
such
primitive
things
that
a
comfort
he
said
you
can
see
the
grand
stand
shall
we
take
a
turn
round
through
the
flower
and
fruit
garden
against
whose
high
outer
walls
peach
trees
and
nectarines
were
trained
to
the
sun
through
the
stables
the
vinery
the
mushroom
house
the
asparagus
beds
the
rosery
the
he
conducted
into
the
kitchen
garden
to
see
the
tiny
green
peas
which
holly
loved
to
scoop
out
of
their
pods
with
her
finger
and
lick
up
from
the
palm
of
her
little
brown
hand
many
delightful
things
he
showed
her
while
holly
and
the
dog
balthasar
danced
ahead
or
came
to
them
at
intervals
for
attention
it
was
one
of
the
happiest
afternoons
he
had
ever
spent
but
it
tired
him
and
he
was
glad
to
sit
down
in
the
music
room
and
let
her
give
him
tea
a
special
little
friend
of
holly
had
come
fair
child
with
short
hair
like
a
boy
and
the
two
sported
in
the
distance
under
the
stairs
on
the
stairs
and
up
in
the
gallery
old
jolyon
begged
for
chopin
she
played
studies
mazurkas
waltzes
till
the
two
children
creeping
near
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
piano
their
dark
and
golden
heads
bent
forward
listening
old
jolyon
watched
let
see
you
dance
you
two
shyly
with
a
false
start
they
began
bobbing
and
circling
earnest
not
very
adroit
they
went
past
and
past
his
chair
to
the
strains
of
that
waltz
he
watched
them
and
the
face
of
her
who
was
playing
turned
smiling
towards
those
little
dancers
thinking
picture
i
seen
for
ages
a
voice
said
hollee
mais
que
tu
fais
le
dimanche
viens
donc
but
the
children
came
close
to
old
jolyon
knowing
that
he
would
save
them
and
gazed
into
a
face
which
was
decidedly
out
better
the
day
better
the
deed
it
all
my
doing
trot
along
chicks
and
have
your
and
when
they
were
gone
followed
by
the
dog
balthasar
who
took
every
meal
he
looked
at
irene
with
a
twinkle
and
said
well
there
we
are
are
they
sweet
have
you
any
little
ones
among
your
pupils
yes
of
them
pretty
lovely
old
jolyon
sighed
he
had
an
insatiable
appetite
for
the
very
young
my
little
sweet
he
said
is
devoted
to
music
she
be
a
musician
some
day
you
would
give
me
your
opinion
of
her
playing
i
suppose
of
course
i
you
would
but
he
stifled
the
words
to
give
her
the
idea
that
she
gave
lessons
was
unpleasant
to
him
yet
it
would
mean
that
he
would
see
her
regularly
she
left
the
piano
and
came
over
to
his
chair
i
would
like
very
much
but
there
when
are
they
coming
back
old
jolyon
frowned
not
till
the
middle
of
next
month
what
does
that
matter
you
said
june
had
forgiven
me
but
she
could
never
forget
uncle
forget
she
must
forget
if
he
wanted
her
to
but
as
if
answering
irene
shook
her
head
you
know
she
could
one
does
always
that
wretched
past
and
he
said
with
a
sort
of
vexed
finality
well
we
shall
he
talked
to
her
an
hour
or
more
of
the
children
and
a
hundred
little
things
till
the
carriage
came
round
to
take
her
home
and
when
she
had
gone
he
went
back
to
his
chair
and
sat
there
smoothing
his
face
and
chin
dreaming
over
the
day
that
evening
after
dinner
he
went
to
his
study
and
took
a
sheet
of
paper
he
stayed
for
some
minutes
without
writing
then
rose
and
stood
under
the
masterpiece
fishing
boats
at
sunset
he
was
not
thinking
of
that
picture
but
of
his
life
he
was
going
to
leave
her
something
in
his
will
nothing
could
so
have
stirred
the
stilly
deeps
of
thought
and
memory
he
was
going
to
leave
her
a
portion
of
his
wealth
of
his
aspirations
deeds
qualities
that
had
made
that
wealth
going
to
leave
her
too
a
part
of
all
he
had
missed
in
life
by
his
sane
and
steady
pursuit
of
wealth
all
what
had
he
missed
fishing
boats
responded
blankly
he
crossed
to
the
french
window
and
drawing
the
curtain
aside
opened
it
a
wind
had
got
up
and
one
of
last
year
oak
leaves
which
had
somehow
survived
the
gardener
brooms
was
dragging
itself
with
a
tiny
clicking
rustle
along
the
stone
terrace
in
the
twilight
except
for
that
it
was
very
quiet
out
there
and
he
could
smell
the
heliotrope
watered
not
long
since
a
bat
went
by
a
bird
uttered
its
last
and
right
above
the
oak
tree
the
first
star
shone
faust
in
the
opera
had
bartered
his
soul
for
some
fresh
years
of
youth
morbid
notion
no
such
bargain
was
possible
that
was
real
tragedy
no
making
oneself
new
again
for
love
or
life
or
anything
nothing
left
to
do
but
enjoy
beauty
from
afar
off
while
you
could
and
leave
it
something
in
your
will
but
how
much
and
as
if
he
could
not
make
that
calculation
looking
out
into
the
mild
freedom
of
the
country
night
he
turned
back
and
went
up
to
the
there
were
his
pet
cleopatra
with
the
asp
at
her
breast
a
socrates
a
greyhound
playing
with
her
puppy
a
strong
man
reining
in
some
horses
last
he
thought
and
a
pang
went
through
his
heart
they
had
a
thousand
years
of
life
before
them
much
well
enough
at
all
events
to
save
her
getting
old
before
her
time
to
keep
the
lines
out
of
her
face
as
long
as
possible
and
grey
from
soiling
that
bright
hair
he
might
live
another
five
years
she
would
be
well
over
thirty
by
then
much
she
had
none
of
his
blood
in
her
in
loyalty
to
the
tenor
of
his
life
for
forty
years
and
more
ever
since
he
married
and
founded
that
mysterious
thing
a
family
came
this
warning
of
his
blood
no
right
to
anything
it
was
a
luxury
then
this
notion
an
extravagance
a
petting
of
an
old
man
whim
one
of
those
things
done
in
dotage
his
real
future
was
vested
in
those
who
had
his
blood
in
whom
he
would
live
on
when
he
was
gone
he
turned
away
from
the
bronzes
and
stood
looking
at
the
old
leather
chair
in
which
he
had
sat
and
smoked
so
many
hundreds
of
cigars
and
suddenly
he
seemed
to
see
her
sitting
there
in
her
grey
dress
fragrant
soft
graceful
looking
up
at
him
why
she
cared
nothing
for
him
really
all
she
cared
for
was
that
lost
lover
of
hers
but
she
was
there
whether
she
would
or
no
giving
him
pleasure
with
her
beauty
and
grace
one
had
no
right
to
inflict
an
old
man
company
no
right
to
ask
her
down
to
play
to
him
and
let
him
look
at
no
reward
pleasure
must
be
paid
for
in
this
world
much
after
all
there
was
plenty
his
son
and
his
three
grandchildren
would
never
miss
that
little
lump
he
had
made
it
himself
nearly
every
penny
he
could
leave
it
where
he
liked
allow
himself
this
little
pleasure
he
went
back
to
the
bureau
i
going
to
he
thought
them
think
what
they
like
i
going
to
and
he
sat
down
much
ten
thousand
twenty
much
if
only
with
his
money
he
could
buy
one
year
one
month
of
youth
and
startled
by
that
thought
he
wrote
quickly
herring
me
a
codicil
to
this
effect
i
leave
to
my
niece
irene
forsyte
born
irene
heron
by
which
name
she
now
goes
fifteen
thousand
pounds
free
of
legacy
faithfully
forsyte
when
he
had
sealed
and
stamped
the
envelope
he
went
back
to
the
window
and
drew
in
a
long
breath
it
was
dark
but
many
stars
shone
now
iv
he
woke
at
two
an
hour
which
long
experience
had
taught
him
brings
panic
intensity
to
all
awkward
thoughts
experience
had
also
taught
him
that
a
further
waking
at
the
proper
hour
of
eight
showed
the
folly
of
such
panic
on
this
particular
morning
the
thought
which
gathered
rapid
momentum
was
that
if
he
became
ill
at
his
age
not
improbable
he
would
not
see
her
from
this
it
was
but
a
step
to
realisation
that
he
would
be
cut
off
too
when
his
son
and
june
returned
from
spain
how
could
he
justify
desire
for
the
company
of
one
who
had
morning
does
not
mince
lover
that
lover
was
dead
but
june
was
a
stubborn
little
thing
but
stubborn
as
wood
one
who
forgot
by
the
middle
of
next
month
they
would
be
back
he
had
barely
five
weeks
left
to
enjoy
the
new
interest
which
had
come
into
what
remained
of
his
life
darkness
showed
up
to
him
absurdly
clear
the
nature
of
his
feeling
admiration
for
craving
to
see
that
which
delighted
his
eyes
preposterous
at
his
age
and
other
reason
was
there
for
asking
june
to
undergo
such
painful
reminder
and
how
prevent
his
son
and
his
son
wife
from
thinking
him
very
queer
he
would
be
reduced
to
sneaking
up
to
london
which
tired
him
and
the
least
indisposition
would
cut
him
off
even
from
that
he
lay
with
eyes
open
setting
his
jaw
against
the
prospect
and
calling
himself
an
old
fool
while
his
heart
beat
loudly
and
then
seemed
to
stop
beating
altogether
he
had
seen
the
dawn
lighting
the
window
chinks
heard
the
birds
chirp
and
twitter
and
the
cocks
crow
before
he
fell
asleep
again
and
awoke
tired
but
sane
five
weeks
before
he
need
bother
at
his
age
an
eternity
but
that
early
morning
panic
had
left
its
mark
had
slightly
fevered
the
will
of
one
who
had
always
had
his
own
way
he
would
see
her
as
often
as
he
wished
why
not
go
up
to
town
and
make
that
codicil
at
his
solicitor
instead
of
writing
about
it
she
might
like
to
go
to
the
opera
but
by
train
for
he
would
not
have
that
fat
chap
beacon
grinning
behind
his
back
servants
were
such
fools
and
as
likely
as
not
they
had
known
all
the
past
history
of
irene
and
young
knew
everything
and
suspected
the
rest
he
wrote
to
her
that
morning
my
dear
irene
have
to
be
up
in
town
if
you
would
like
to
have
a
look
in
at
the
opera
come
and
dine
with
me
quietly
but
where
it
was
decades
since
he
had
dined
anywhere
in
london
save
at
his
club
or
at
a
private
house
ah
that
place
close
to
covent
garden
let
me
have
a
line
morning
to
the
piedmont
hotel
whether
to
expect
you
there
at
yours
affectionately
jolyon
she
would
understand
that
he
just
wanted
to
give
her
a
little
pleasure
for
the
idea
that
she
should
guess
he
had
this
itch
to
see
her
was
instinctively
unpleasant
to
him
it
was
not
seemly
that
one
so
old
should
go
out
of
his
way
to
see
beauty
especially
in
a
woman
the
journey
next
day
short
though
it
was
and
the
visit
to
his
lawyer
tired
him
it
was
hot
too
and
after
dressing
for
dinner
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
his
bedroom
to
rest
a
little
he
must
have
had
a
sort
of
fainting
fit
for
he
came
to
himself
feeling
very
queer
and
with
some
difficulty
rose
and
rang
the
bell
why
it
was
past
seven
and
there
he
was
and
she
would
be
waiting
but
suddenly
the
dizziness
came
on
again
and
he
was
obliged
to
relapse
on
the
sofa
he
heard
the
voice
say
did
you
ring
sir
yes
come
here
he
could
not
see
her
clearly
for
the
cloud
in
front
of
his
eyes
i
not
well
i
want
some
sal
yes
her
voice
sounded
frightened
old
jolyon
made
an
effort
do
go
take
this
message
to
my
lady
waiting
in
the
lady
in
grey
say
forsyte
is
not
heat
he
is
very
sorry
if
he
is
not
down
directly
she
is
not
to
wait
when
she
was
gone
he
thought
feebly
did
i
say
a
lady
in
may
be
in
anything
sal
volatile
he
did
not
go
off
again
yet
was
not
conscious
of
how
irene
came
to
be
standing
beside
him
holding
smelling
salts
to
his
nose
and
pushing
a
pillow
up
behind
his
head
he
heard
her
say
anxiously
dear
uncle
jolyon
what
is
it
was
dimly
conscious
of
the
soft
pressure
of
her
lips
on
his
hand
then
drew
a
long
breath
of
smelling
salts
suddenly
discovered
strength
in
them
and
sneezed
ha
he
said
it
nothing
how
did
you
get
here
go
down
and
tickets
are
on
the
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
he
felt
her
cool
hand
on
his
forehead
smelled
violets
and
sat
divided
between
a
sort
of
pleasure
and
a
determination
to
be
all
right
why
you
are
in
grey
he
said
help
me
once
on
his
feet
he
gave
himself
a
shake
what
business
had
i
to
go
off
like
that
and
he
moved
very
slowly
to
the
glass
what
a
cadaverous
chap
her
voice
behind
him
murmured
you
must
come
down
uncle
you
must
fiddlesticks
a
glass
of
champagne
soon
set
me
to
rights
i
have
you
missing
the
but
the
journey
down
the
corridor
was
troublesome
what
carpets
they
had
in
these
newfangled
places
so
thick
that
you
tripped
up
in
them
at
every
step
in
the
lift
he
noticed
how
concerned
she
looked
and
said
with
the
ghost
of
a
twinkle
i
a
pretty
when
the
lift
stopped
he
had
to
hold
firmly
to
the
seat
to
prevent
its
slipping
under
him
but
after
soup
and
a
glass
of
champagne
he
felt
much
better
and
began
to
enjoy
an
infirmity
which
had
brought
such
solicitude
into
her
manner
towards
him
i
should
have
liked
you
for
a
daughter
he
said
suddenly
and
watching
the
smile
in
her
eyes
went
on
you
must
get
wrapped
up
in
the
past
at
your
time
of
life
plenty
of
that
when
you
get
to
my
age
that
a
nice
like
the
i
made
it
ah
a
woman
who
could
make
herself
a
pretty
frock
had
not
lost
her
interest
in
life
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
he
said
and
drink
that
up
i
want
to
see
some
colour
in
your
cheeks
we
must
waste
life
it
does
do
there
a
new
marguerite
let
hope
she
wo
be
fat
and
more
dreadful
than
a
fat
chap
playing
the
devil
i
ca
but
they
did
not
go
to
the
opera
after
all
for
in
getting
up
from
dinner
the
dizziness
came
over
him
again
and
she
insisted
on
his
staying
quiet
and
going
to
bed
early
when
he
parted
from
her
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
having
paid
the
cabman
to
drive
her
to
chelsea
he
sat
down
again
for
a
moment
to
enjoy
the
memory
of
her
words
you
are
such
a
darling
to
me
uncle
jolyon
why
who
would
be
he
would
have
liked
to
stay
up
another
day
and
take
her
to
the
zoo
but
two
days
running
of
him
would
bore
her
to
death
no
he
must
wait
till
next
sunday
she
had
promised
to
come
then
they
would
settle
those
lessons
for
holly
if
only
for
a
month
it
would
be
something
that
little
beauce
would
like
it
but
she
would
have
to
lump
it
and
crushing
his
old
opera
hat
against
his
chest
he
sought
the
lift
he
drove
to
waterloo
next
morning
struggling
with
a
desire
to
say
me
to
chelsea
but
his
sense
of
proportion
was
too
strong
besides
he
still
felt
shaky
and
did
not
want
to
risk
another
aberration
like
that
of
last
night
away
from
home
holly
too
was
expecting
him
and
what
he
had
in
his
bag
for
her
not
that
there
was
any
cupboard
love
in
his
little
was
a
bundle
of
affection
then
with
the
rather
bitter
cynicism
of
the
old
he
wondered
for
a
second
whether
it
was
not
cupboard
love
which
made
irene
put
up
with
him
no
she
was
not
that
sort
either
she
had
if
anything
too
little
notion
of
how
to
butter
her
bread
no
sense
of
property
poor
thing
besides
he
had
not
breathed
a
word
about
that
codicil
nor
should
unto
the
day
was
the
good
thereof
in
the
victoria
which
met
him
at
the
station
holly
was
restraining
the
dog
balthasar
and
their
caresses
made
his
drive
home
all
the
rest
of
that
fine
hot
day
and
most
of
the
next
he
was
content
and
peaceful
reposing
in
the
shade
while
the
long
lingering
sunshine
showered
gold
on
the
lawns
and
the
flowers
but
on
thursday
evening
at
his
lonely
dinner
he
began
to
count
the
hours
till
he
would
go
down
to
meet
her
again
in
the
little
coppice
and
walk
up
through
the
fields
at
her
side
he
had
intended
to
consult
the
doctor
about
his
fainting
fit
but
the
fellow
would
be
sure
to
insist
on
quiet
no
excitement
and
all
that
and
he
did
not
mean
to
be
tied
by
the
leg
did
not
want
to
be
told
of
an
there
were
one
could
not
afford
to
hear
of
it
at
his
time
of
life
now
that
this
new
interest
had
come
and
he
carefully
avoided
making
any
mention
of
it
in
a
letter
to
his
son
it
would
only
bring
them
back
with
a
run
how
far
this
silence
was
due
to
consideration
for
their
pleasure
how
far
to
regard
for
his
own
he
did
not
pause
to
consider
that
night
in
his
study
he
had
just
finished
his
cigar
and
was
dozing
off
when
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
gown
and
was
conscious
of
a
scent
of
violets
opening
his
eyes
he
saw
her
dressed
in
grey
standing
by
the
fireplace
holding
out
her
arms
the
odd
thing
was
that
though
those
arms
seemed
to
hold
nothing
they
were
curved
as
if
round
neck
and
her
own
neck
was
bent
back
her
lips
open
her
eyes
closed
she
vanished
at
once
and
there
were
the
mantelpiece
and
his
bronzes
but
those
bronzes
and
the
mantelpiece
had
not
been
there
when
she
was
only
the
fireplace
and
the
wall
shaken
and
troubled
he
got
up
must
take
medicine
he
thought
ca
be
well
his
heart
beat
too
fast
he
had
an
asthmatic
feeling
in
the
chest
and
going
to
the
window
he
opened
it
to
get
some
air
a
dog
was
barking
far
away
one
of
the
dogs
at
gage
farm
no
doubt
beyond
the
coppice
a
beautiful
still
night
but
dark
dropped
off
he
mused
it
and
yet
i
swear
my
eyes
were
open
a
sound
like
a
sigh
seemed
to
answer
what
that
he
said
sharply
who
there
putting
his
hand
to
his
side
to
still
the
beating
of
his
heart
he
stepped
out
on
the
terrace
something
soft
scurried
by
in
the
dark
shoo
it
was
that
great
grey
cat
bosinney
was
like
a
great
cat
he
thought
was
him
in
there
that
she
got
her
still
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
terrace
and
looked
down
into
the
darkness
he
could
just
see
the
powdering
of
the
daisies
on
the
unmown
lawn
here
and
gone
and
there
came
the
moon
who
saw
all
young
and
old
alive
and
dead
and
did
care
a
dump
his
own
turn
soon
for
a
single
day
of
youth
he
would
give
what
was
left
and
he
turned
again
towards
the
house
he
could
see
the
windows
of
the
night
nursery
up
there
his
little
sweet
would
be
asleep
that
dog
wo
wake
her
he
thought
is
it
makes
us
love
and
makes
us
die
i
must
go
to
bed
and
across
the
terrace
stones
growing
grey
in
the
moonlight
he
passed
back
within
how
should
an
old
man
live
his
days
if
not
in
dreaming
of
his
past
in
that
at
all
events
there
is
no
agitating
warmth
only
pale
winter
sunshine
the
shell
can
withstand
the
gentle
beating
of
the
dynamos
of
memory
the
present
he
should
distrust
the
future
shun
from
beneath
thick
shade
he
should
watch
the
sunlight
creeping
at
his
toes
if
there
be
sun
of
summer
let
him
not
go
out
into
it
mistaking
it
for
the
sun
thus
peradventure
he
shall
decline
softly
slowly
imperceptibly
until
impatient
nature
clutches
his
and
he
gasps
away
to
death
some
early
morning
before
the
world
is
aired
and
they
put
on
his
tombstone
the
fulness
of
years
yea
if
he
preserve
his
principles
in
perfect
order
a
forsyte
may
live
on
long
after
he
is
dead
old
jolyon
was
conscious
of
all
this
and
yet
there
was
in
him
that
which
transcended
forsyteism
for
it
is
written
that
a
forsyte
shall
not
love
beauty
more
than
reason
nor
his
own
way
more
than
his
own
health
and
something
beat
within
him
in
these
days
that
with
each
throb
fretted
at
the
thinning
shell
his
sagacity
knew
this
but
it
knew
too
that
he
could
not
stop
that
beating
nor
would
if
he
could
and
yet
if
you
had
told
him
he
was
living
on
his
capital
he
would
have
stared
you
down
no
no
a
man
did
not
live
on
his
capital
it
was
not
done
the
shibboleths
of
the
past
are
ever
more
real
than
the
actualities
of
the
present
and
he
to
whom
living
on
one
capital
had
always
been
anathema
could
not
have
borne
to
have
applied
so
gross
a
phrase
to
his
own
case
pleasure
is
healthful
beauty
good
to
see
to
live
again
in
the
youth
of
the
what
else
on
earth
was
he
doing
methodically
as
had
been
the
way
of
his
whole
life
he
now
arranged
his
time
on
tuesdays
he
journeyed
up
to
town
by
train
irene
came
and
dined
with
him
and
they
went
to
the
opera
on
thursdays
he
drove
to
town
and
putting
that
fat
chap
and
his
horses
up
met
her
in
kensington
gardens
picking
up
the
carriage
after
he
had
left
her
and
driving
home
again
in
time
for
dinner
he
threw
out
the
casual
formula
that
he
had
business
in
london
on
those
two
days
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
she
came
down
to
give
holly
music
lessons
the
greater
the
pleasure
he
took
in
her
society
the
more
scrupulously
fastidious
he
became
just
a
and
friendly
uncle
not
even
in
feeling
really
was
he
after
all
there
was
his
age
and
yet
if
she
were
late
he
fidgeted
himself
to
death
if
she
missed
coming
which
happened
twice
his
eyes
grew
sad
as
an
old
dog
and
he
failed
to
sleep
and
so
a
month
went
month
of
summer
in
the
fields
and
in
his
heart
with
summer
heat
and
the
fatigue
thereof
who
could
have
believed
a
few
weeks
back
that
he
would
have
looked
forward
to
his
and
his
return
with
something
like
dread
there
was
such
a
delicious
freedom
such
recovery
of
that
independence
a
man
enjoys
before
he
founds
a
family
about
these
weeks
of
lovely
weather
and
this
new
companionship
with
one
who
demanded
nothing
and
remained
always
a
little
unknown
retaining
the
fascination
of
mystery
it
was
like
a
draught
of
wine
to
him
who
has
been
drinking
water
for
so
long
that
he
has
almost
forgotten
the
stir
wine
brings
to
his
blood
the
narcotic
to
his
brain
the
flowers
were
coloured
brighter
scents
and
music
and
the
sunlight
had
a
living
no
longer
mere
reminders
of
past
enjoyment
there
was
something
now
to
live
for
which
stirred
him
continually
to
anticipation
he
lived
in
that
not
in
retrospection
the
difference
is
considerable
to
any
so
old
as
he
the
pleasures
of
the
table
never
of
much
consequence
to
one
naturally
abstemious
had
lost
all
value
he
ate
little
without
knowing
what
he
ate
and
every
day
grew
thinner
and
more
worn
to
look
at
he
was
again
a
and
to
this
thinned
form
his
massive
forehead
with
hollows
at
the
temples
gave
more
dignity
than
ever
he
was
very
well
aware
that
he
ought
to
see
the
doctor
but
liberty
was
too
sweet
he
could
not
afford
to
pet
his
frequent
shortness
of
breath
and
the
pain
in
his
side
at
the
expense
of
liberty
return
to
the
vegetable
existence
he
had
led
among
the
agricultural
journals
with
the
mangold
wurzels
before
this
new
attraction
came
into
his
he
exceeded
his
allowance
of
cigars
two
a
day
had
always
been
his
rule
now
he
smoked
three
and
sometimes
man
will
when
he
is
filled
with
the
creative
spirit
but
very
often
he
thought
must
give
up
smoking
and
coffee
i
must
give
up
rattling
up
to
town
but
he
did
not
there
was
no
one
in
any
sort
of
authority
to
notice
him
and
this
was
a
priceless
boon
the
servants
perhaps
wondered
but
they
were
naturally
dumb
beauce
was
too
concerned
with
her
own
digestion
and
too
to
make
personal
allusions
holly
had
not
as
yet
an
eye
for
the
relative
appearance
of
him
who
was
her
plaything
and
her
god
it
was
left
for
irene
herself
to
beg
him
to
eat
more
to
rest
in
the
hot
part
of
the
day
to
take
a
tonic
and
so
forth
but
she
did
not
tell
him
that
she
was
the
cause
of
his
one
can
not
see
the
havoc
oneself
is
working
a
man
of
has
no
passions
but
the
beauty
which
produces
passion
works
on
in
the
old
way
till
death
closes
the
eyes
which
crave
the
sight
of
her
on
the
first
day
of
the
second
week
in
july
he
received
a
letter
from
his
son
in
paris
to
say
that
they
would
all
be
back
on
friday
this
had
always
been
more
sure
than
fate
but
with
the
pathetic
improvidence
given
to
the
old
that
they
may
endure
to
the
end
he
had
never
quite
admitted
it
now
he
did
and
something
would
have
to
be
done
he
had
ceased
to
be
able
to
imagine
life
without
this
new
interest
but
that
which
is
not
imagined
sometimes
exists
as
forsytes
are
perpetually
finding
to
their
cost
he
sat
in
his
old
leather
chair
doubling
up
the
letter
and
mumbling
with
his
lips
the
end
of
an
unlighted
cigar
after
his
tuesday
expeditions
to
town
would
have
to
be
abandoned
he
could
still
drive
up
perhaps
once
a
week
on
the
pretext
of
seeing
his
man
of
business
but
even
that
would
be
dependent
on
his
health
for
now
they
would
begin
to
fuss
about
him
the
lessons
the
lessons
must
go
on
she
must
swallow
down
her
scruples
and
june
must
put
her
feelings
in
her
pocket
she
had
done
so
once
on
the
day
after
the
news
of
bosinney
death
what
she
had
done
then
she
could
surely
do
again
now
four
years
since
that
injury
was
inflicted
on
christian
to
keep
the
memory
of
old
sores
alive
june
will
was
strong
but
his
was
stronger
for
his
sands
were
running
out
irene
was
soft
surely
she
would
do
this
for
him
subdue
her
natural
shrinking
sooner
than
give
him
pain
the
lessons
must
continue
for
if
they
did
he
was
secure
and
lighting
his
cigar
at
last
he
began
trying
to
shape
out
how
to
put
it
to
them
all
and
explain
this
strange
intimacy
how
to
veil
and
wrap
it
away
from
the
naked
he
could
not
bear
to
be
deprived
of
the
sight
of
beauty
ah
holly
holly
was
fond
of
her
holly
liked
her
lessons
she
would
save
little
sweet
and
with
that
happy
thought
he
became
serene
and
wondered
what
he
had
been
worrying
about
so
fearfully
he
must
not
worry
it
left
him
always
curiously
weak
and
as
if
but
half
present
in
his
own
body
that
evening
after
dinner
he
had
a
return
of
the
dizziness
though
he
did
not
faint
he
would
not
ring
the
bell
because
he
knew
it
would
mean
a
fuss
and
make
his
going
up
on
the
morrow
more
conspicuous
when
one
grew
old
the
whole
world
was
in
conspiracy
to
limit
freedom
and
for
what
reason
to
keep
the
breath
in
him
a
little
longer
he
did
not
want
it
at
such
cost
only
the
dog
balthasar
saw
his
lonely
recovery
from
that
weakness
anxiously
watched
his
master
go
to
the
sideboard
and
drink
some
brandy
instead
of
giving
him
a
biscuit
when
at
last
old
jolyon
felt
able
to
tackle
the
stairs
he
went
up
to
bed
and
though
still
shaky
next
morning
the
thought
of
the
evening
sustained
and
strengthened
him
it
was
always
such
a
pleasure
to
give
her
a
good
suspected
her
of
undereating
when
she
was
alone
and
at
the
opera
to
watch
her
eyes
glow
and
brighten
the
unconscious
smiling
of
her
lips
she
had
much
pleasure
and
this
was
the
last
time
he
would
be
able
to
give
her
that
treat
but
when
he
was
packing
his
bag
he
caught
himself
wishing
that
he
had
not
the
fatigue
of
dressing
for
dinner
before
him
and
the
exertion
too
of
telling
her
about
return
the
opera
that
evening
was
and
he
chose
the
last
to
break
the
news
instinctively
putting
it
off
till
the
latest
moment
she
took
it
quietly
queerly
in
fact
he
did
not
know
how
she
had
taken
it
before
the
wayward
music
lifted
up
again
and
silence
became
necessary
the
mask
was
down
over
her
face
that
mask
behind
which
so
much
went
on
that
he
could
not
see
she
wanted
time
to
think
it
over
no
doubt
he
would
not
press
her
for
she
would
be
coming
to
give
her
lesson
afternoon
and
he
should
see
her
then
when
she
had
got
used
to
the
idea
in
the
cab
he
talked
only
of
the
carmen
he
had
seen
better
in
the
old
days
but
this
one
was
not
bad
at
all
when
he
took
her
hand
to
say
she
bent
quickly
forward
and
kissed
his
forehead
dear
uncle
jolyon
you
have
been
so
sweet
to
then
he
said
sleep
she
echoed
softly
sleep
well
and
from
the
cab
window
already
moving
away
he
saw
her
face
screwed
round
towards
him
and
her
hand
put
out
in
a
gesture
which
seemed
to
linger
he
sought
his
room
slowly
they
never
gave
him
the
same
and
he
could
not
get
used
to
these
bedrooms
with
new
furniture
and
carpets
sprinkled
all
over
with
pink
roses
he
was
wakeful
and
that
wretched
habanera
kept
throbbing
in
his
head
his
french
had
never
been
equal
to
its
words
but
its
sense
he
knew
if
it
had
any
sense
a
gipsy
and
unaccountable
well
there
was
in
life
something
which
upset
all
your
care
and
which
made
men
and
women
dance
to
its
pipes
and
he
lay
staring
from
eyes
into
the
darkness
where
the
unaccountable
held
sway
you
thought
you
had
hold
of
life
but
it
slipped
away
behind
you
took
you
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
forced
you
here
and
forced
you
there
and
then
likely
as
not
squeezed
life
out
of
you
it
took
the
very
stars
like
that
he
should
wonder
rubbed
their
noses
together
and
flung
them
apart
it
had
never
done
playing
its
pranks
five
million
people
in
this
great
blunderbuss
of
a
town
and
all
of
them
at
the
mercy
of
that
like
a
lot
of
little
dried
peas
hopping
about
on
a
board
when
you
struck
your
fist
on
it
ah
well
himself
would
not
hop
much
good
long
sleep
would
do
him
good
how
hot
it
was
up
here
noisy
his
forehead
burned
she
had
kissed
it
just
where
he
always
worried
just
if
she
had
known
the
very
place
and
wanted
to
kiss
it
all
away
for
him
but
instead
her
lips
left
a
patch
of
grievous
uneasiness
she
had
never
spoken
in
quite
that
voice
had
never
before
made
that
lingering
gesture
or
looked
back
at
him
as
she
drove
away
he
got
out
of
bed
and
pulled
the
curtains
aside
his
room
faced
down
over
the
river
there
was
little
air
but
the
sight
of
that
breadth
of
water
flowing
by
calm
eternal
soothed
him
great
thing
he
thought
not
to
make
myself
a
nuisance
i
think
of
my
little
sweet
and
go
to
sleep
but
it
was
long
before
the
heat
and
throbbing
of
the
london
night
died
out
into
the
short
slumber
of
the
summer
morning
and
old
jolyon
had
but
forty
winks
when
he
reached
home
next
day
he
went
out
to
the
flower
garden
and
with
the
help
of
holly
who
was
very
delicate
with
flowers
gathered
a
great
bunch
of
carnations
they
were
he
told
her
for
lady
in
name
still
bandied
between
them
and
he
put
them
in
a
bowl
in
his
study
where
he
meant
to
tackle
irene
the
moment
she
came
on
the
subject
of
june
and
future
lessons
their
fragrance
and
colour
would
help
after
lunch
he
lay
down
for
he
felt
very
tired
and
the
carriage
would
not
bring
her
from
the
station
till
four
but
as
the
hour
approached
he
grew
restless
and
sought
the
schoolroom
which
overlooked
the
drive
the
were
down
and
holly
was
there
with
mademoiselle
beauce
sheltered
from
the
heat
of
a
stifling
july
day
attending
to
their
silkworms
old
jolyon
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
these
methodical
creatures
whose
heads
and
colour
reminded
him
of
elephants
who
nibbled
such
quantities
of
holes
in
nice
green
leaves
and
smelled
as
he
thought
horrid
he
sat
down
on
a
windowseat
whence
he
could
see
the
drive
and
get
what
air
there
was
and
the
dog
balthasar
who
appreciated
chintz
on
hot
days
jumped
up
beside
him
over
the
cottage
piano
a
violet
faded
almost
to
grey
was
spread
and
on
it
the
first
lavender
whose
scent
filled
the
room
in
spite
of
the
coolness
here
perhaps
because
of
that
coolness
the
beat
of
life
vehemently
impressed
his
senses
each
sunbeam
which
came
through
the
chinks
had
annoying
brilliance
that
dog
smelled
very
strong
the
lavender
perfume
was
overpowering
those
silkworms
heaving
up
their
backs
seemed
horribly
alive
and
holly
dark
head
bent
over
them
had
a
wonderfully
silky
sheen
a
marvellous
cruelly
strong
thing
was
life
when
you
were
old
and
weak
it
seemed
to
mock
you
with
its
multitude
of
forms
and
its
beating
vitality
he
had
never
till
those
last
few
weeks
had
this
curious
feeling
of
being
with
one
half
of
him
eagerly
borne
along
in
the
stream
of
life
and
with
the
other
half
left
on
the
bank
watching
that
helpless
progress
only
when
irene
was
with
him
did
he
lose
this
double
consciousness
holly
turned
her
head
pointed
with
her
little
brown
fist
to
the
to
point
with
a
finger
was
not
said
slyly
look
at
the
in
grey
gran
is
she
pretty
old
jolyon
heart
gave
a
flutter
and
for
a
second
the
room
was
clouded
then
it
cleared
and
he
said
with
a
twinkle
who
been
dressing
her
up
hollee
do
be
foolish
that
prim
little
frenchwoman
she
had
yet
got
over
the
music
lessons
being
taken
away
from
her
that
would
help
his
little
sweet
was
the
only
friend
they
had
well
they
were
her
lessons
and
he
budge
should
budge
for
anything
he
stroked
the
warm
wool
on
balthasar
head
and
heard
holly
say
when
mother
home
there
be
any
changes
will
there
she
does
like
strangers
you
the
child
words
seemed
to
bring
the
chilly
atmosphere
of
opposition
about
old
jolyon
and
disclose
all
the
menace
to
his
freedom
ah
he
would
have
to
resign
himself
to
being
an
old
man
at
the
mercy
of
care
and
love
or
fight
to
keep
this
new
and
prized
companionship
and
to
fight
tired
him
to
death
but
his
thin
worn
face
hardened
into
resolution
till
it
appeared
all
jaw
this
was
his
house
and
his
affair
he
should
not
budge
he
looked
at
his
watch
old
and
thin
like
himself
he
had
owned
it
fifty
years
past
four
already
and
kissing
the
top
of
holly
head
in
passing
he
went
down
to
the
hall
he
wanted
to
get
hold
of
her
before
she
went
up
to
give
her
lesson
at
the
first
sound
of
wheels
he
stepped
out
into
the
porch
and
saw
at
once
that
the
victoria
was
empty
the
train
in
sir
but
the
lady
old
jolyon
gave
him
a
sharp
upward
look
his
eyes
seemed
to
push
away
that
fat
chap
curiosity
and
defy
him
to
see
the
bitter
disappointment
he
was
feeling
very
well
he
said
and
turned
back
into
the
house
he
went
to
his
study
and
sat
down
quivering
like
a
leaf
what
did
this
mean
she
might
have
lost
her
train
but
he
knew
well
enough
she
had
dear
uncle
jolyon
why
and
not
and
that
hand
of
hers
lingering
in
the
air
and
her
kiss
what
did
it
mean
vehement
alarm
and
irritation
took
possession
of
him
he
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
turkey
carpet
between
window
and
wall
she
was
going
to
give
him
up
he
felt
it
for
he
defenceless
an
old
man
wanting
to
look
on
beauty
it
was
ridiculous
age
closed
his
mouth
paralysed
his
power
to
fight
he
had
no
right
to
what
was
warm
and
living
no
right
to
anything
but
memories
and
sorrow
he
could
not
plead
with
her
even
an
old
man
has
his
dignity
defenceless
for
an
hour
lost
to
bodily
fatigue
he
paced
up
and
down
past
the
bowl
of
carnations
he
had
plucked
which
mocked
him
with
its
scent
of
all
things
hard
to
bear
the
prostration
of
is
hardest
for
one
who
has
always
had
his
way
nature
had
got
him
in
its
net
and
like
an
unhappy
fish
he
turned
and
swam
at
the
meshes
here
and
there
found
no
hole
no
breaking
point
they
brought
him
tea
at
five
and
a
letter
for
a
moment
hope
beat
up
in
him
he
cut
the
envelope
with
the
butter
knife
and
read
dearest
uncle
jolyon
ca
bear
to
write
anything
that
may
disappoint
you
but
i
was
too
cowardly
to
tell
you
last
night
i
feel
i
ca
come
down
and
give
holly
any
more
lessons
now
that
june
is
coming
back
some
things
go
too
deep
to
be
forgotten
it
has
been
such
a
joy
to
see
you
and
holly
perhaps
i
shall
still
see
you
sometimes
when
you
come
up
though
i
sure
it
not
good
for
you
i
can
see
you
are
tiring
yourself
too
much
i
believe
you
ought
to
rest
quite
quietly
all
this
hot
weather
and
now
you
have
your
son
and
june
coming
back
you
will
be
so
happy
thank
you
a
million
times
for
all
your
sweetness
to
me
lovingly
your
so
there
it
was
not
good
for
him
to
have
pleasure
and
what
he
chiefly
cared
about
to
try
and
put
off
feeling
the
inevitable
end
of
all
things
the
approach
of
death
with
its
stealthy
rustling
footsteps
not
good
for
him
not
even
she
could
see
how
she
was
his
new
lease
of
interest
in
life
the
incarnation
of
all
the
beauty
he
felt
slipping
from
him
his
tea
grew
cold
his
cigar
remained
unlit
and
up
and
down
he
paced
torn
between
his
dignity
and
his
hold
on
life
intolerable
to
be
squeezed
out
slowly
without
a
say
of
your
own
to
live
on
when
your
will
was
in
the
hands
of
others
bent
on
weighing
you
to
the
ground
with
care
and
love
intolerable
he
would
see
what
telling
her
the
truth
would
truth
that
he
wanted
the
sight
of
her
more
than
just
a
lingering
on
he
sat
down
at
his
old
bureau
and
took
a
pen
but
he
could
not
write
there
was
something
revolting
in
having
to
plead
like
this
plead
that
she
should
warm
his
eyes
with
her
beauty
it
was
tantamount
to
confessing
dotage
he
simply
could
not
and
instead
he
wrote
i
had
hoped
that
the
memory
of
old
sores
would
not
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
what
is
a
pleasure
and
a
profit
to
me
and
my
little
but
old
men
learn
to
forego
their
whims
they
are
obliged
to
even
the
whim
to
live
must
be
foregone
sooner
or
later
and
perhaps
the
sooner
the
better
my
love
to
you
jolyon
he
thought
i
ca
help
it
i
tired
he
sealed
and
dropped
it
into
the
box
for
the
evening
post
and
hearing
it
fall
to
the
bottom
thought
goes
all
i
looked
forward
to
that
evening
after
dinner
which
he
scarcely
touched
after
his
cigar
which
he
left
for
it
made
him
feel
faint
he
went
very
slowly
upstairs
and
stole
into
the
he
sat
down
on
the
a
was
burning
and
he
could
just
see
face
with
one
hand
underneath
the
cheek
an
early
cockchafer
buzzed
in
the
japanese
paper
with
which
they
had
filled
the
grate
and
one
of
the
horses
in
the
stable
stamped
restlessly
to
sleep
like
that
child
he
pressed
apart
two
rungs
of
the
venetian
blind
and
looked
out
the
moon
was
rising
he
had
never
seen
so
red
a
moon
the
woods
and
fields
out
there
were
dropping
to
sleep
too
in
the
last
glimmer
of
the
summer
light
and
beauty
like
a
spirit
walked
had
a
long
life
he
thought
best
of
nearly
everything
i
an
ungrateful
chap
seen
a
lot
of
beauty
in
my
time
poor
young
bosinney
said
i
had
a
sense
of
beauty
there
a
man
in
the
moon
a
moth
went
by
another
another
in
grey
he
closed
his
eyes
a
feeling
that
he
would
never
open
them
again
beset
him
he
let
it
grow
let
himself
sink
then
with
a
shiver
dragged
the
lids
up
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
no
doubt
deeply
wrong
he
would
have
to
have
the
doctor
after
all
it
did
much
matter
now
into
that
coppice
the
would
have
crept
there
would
be
shadows
and
those
shadows
would
be
the
only
things
awake
no
birds
beasts
flowers
insects
just
the
shadows
in
grey
over
that
log
they
would
climb
would
whisper
together
she
and
bosinney
funny
thought
and
the
frogs
and
little
things
would
whisper
too
how
the
clock
ticked
in
here
it
was
all
there
in
the
light
of
that
red
moon
in
here
with
the
little
steady
and
the
ticking
clock
and
the
nurse
hanging
from
the
edge
of
the
screen
tall
like
a
woman
figure
in
grey
and
a
very
odd
thought
beset
him
did
she
exist
had
she
ever
come
at
all
or
was
she
but
the
emanation
of
all
the
beauty
he
had
loved
and
must
leave
so
soon
the
spirit
with
the
dark
eyes
and
the
crown
of
amber
hair
who
walks
the
dawn
and
the
moonlight
and
at
time
what
was
she
who
was
she
did
she
exist
he
rose
and
stood
a
moment
clutching
the
to
give
him
a
sense
of
reality
again
then
began
tiptoeing
towards
the
door
he
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
holly
as
if
conscious
of
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
stirred
sighed
and
curled
up
closer
in
defence
he
tiptoed
on
and
passed
out
into
the
dark
passage
reached
his
room
undressed
at
once
and
stood
before
a
mirror
in
his
what
a
temples
fallen
in
and
thin
legs
his
eyes
resisted
his
own
image
and
a
look
of
pride
came
on
his
face
all
was
in
league
to
pull
him
down
even
his
reflection
in
the
glass
but
he
was
not
he
got
into
bed
and
lay
a
long
time
without
sleeping
trying
to
reach
resignation
only
too
well
aware
that
fretting
and
disappointment
were
very
bad
for
him
he
woke
in
the
morning
so
unrefreshed
and
strengthless
that
he
sent
for
the
doctor
after
sounding
him
the
fellow
pulled
a
face
as
long
as
your
arm
and
ordered
him
to
stay
in
bed
and
give
up
smoking
that
was
no
hardship
there
was
nothing
to
get
up
for
and
when
he
felt
ill
tobacco
always
lost
its
savour
he
spent
the
morning
languidly
with
the
down
turning
and
the
times
not
reading
much
the
dog
balthasar
lying
beside
his
bed
with
his
lunch
they
brought
him
a
telegram
running
thus
letter
received
coming
down
this
afternoon
will
be
with
you
at
irene
coming
down
after
all
then
she
did
he
was
not
deserted
coming
down
a
glow
ran
through
his
limbs
his
cheeks
and
forehead
felt
hot
he
drank
his
soup
and
pushed
the
away
lying
very
quiet
until
they
had
removed
lunch
and
left
him
alone
but
every
now
and
then
his
eyes
twinkled
coming
down
his
heart
beat
fast
and
then
did
not
seem
to
beat
at
all
at
three
he
got
up
and
dressed
deliberately
noiselessly
holly
and
would
be
in
the
schoolroom
and
the
servants
asleep
after
their
dinner
he
wonder
he
opened
his
door
cautiously
and
went
downstairs
in
the
hall
the
dog
balthasar
lay
solitary
and
followed
by
him
old
jolyon
passed
into
his
study
and
out
into
the
burning
afternoon
he
meant
to
go
down
and
meet
her
in
the
coppice
but
felt
at
once
he
could
not
manage
that
in
this
heat
he
sat
down
instead
under
the
oak
tree
by
the
swing
and
the
dog
balthasar
who
also
felt
the
heat
lay
down
beside
him
he
sat
there
smiling
what
a
revel
of
bright
minutes
what
a
hum
of
insects
and
cooing
of
pigeons
it
was
the
quintessence
of
a
summer
day
lovely
and
he
was
as
a
whatever
that
might
be
she
was
coming
she
had
not
given
him
up
he
had
everything
in
life
he
a
little
more
breath
and
less
here
he
would
see
her
when
she
emerged
from
the
fernery
come
swaying
just
a
little
a
figure
passing
over
the
daisies
and
dandelions
and
on
the
soldiers
with
their
flowery
crowns
he
would
not
move
but
she
would
come
up
to
him
and
say
uncle
jolyon
i
am
sorry
and
sit
in
the
swing
and
let
him
look
at
her
and
tell
her
that
he
had
not
been
very
well
but
was
all
right
now
and
that
dog
would
lick
her
hand
that
dog
knew
his
master
was
fond
of
her
that
dog
was
a
good
dog
it
was
quite
shady
under
the
tree
the
sun
could
not
get
at
him
only
make
the
rest
of
the
world
bright
so
that
he
could
see
the
grand
stand
at
epsom
away
out
there
very
far
and
the
cows
cropping
the
clover
in
the
field
and
swishing
at
the
flies
with
their
tails
he
smelled
the
scent
of
limes
and
lavender
ah
that
was
why
there
was
such
a
racket
of
bees
they
were
as
his
heart
was
busy
and
excited
drowsy
too
drowsy
and
drugged
on
honey
and
happiness
as
his
heart
was
drugged
and
drowsy
seemed
saying
great
bees
and
little
bees
and
the
flies
too
the
stable
clock
struck
four
in
half
an
hour
she
would
be
here
he
would
have
just
one
tiny
nap
because
he
had
had
so
little
sleep
of
late
and
then
he
would
be
fresh
for
her
fresh
for
youth
and
beauty
coming
towards
him
across
the
sunlit
in
grey
and
settling
back
in
his
chair
he
closed
his
eyes
some
came
on
what
little
air
there
was
and
pitched
on
his
moustache
more
white
than
itself
he
did
not
know
but
his
breathing
stirred
it
caught
there
a
ray
of
sunlight
struck
through
and
lodged
on
his
boot
a
alighted
and
strolled
on
the
crown
of
his
panama
hat
and
the
delicious
surge
of
slumber
reached
the
brain
beneath
that
hat
and
the
head
swayed
forward
and
rested
on
his
breast
so
went
the
hum
the
stable
clock
struck
the
quarter
past
the
dog
balthasar
stretched
and
looked
up
at
his
master
the
thistledown
no
longer
moved
the
dog
placed
his
chin
over
the
sunlit
foot
it
did
not
stir
the
dog
withdrew
his
chin
quickly
rose
and
leaped
on
old
jolyon
lap
looked
in
his
face
whined
then
leaping
down
sat
on
his
haunches
gazing
up
and
suddenly
he
uttered
a
long
long
howl
but
the
thistledown
was
still
as
death
and
the
face
of
his
old
master
the
soundless
footsteps
on
the
grass
in
chancery
two
households
both
alike
in
dignity
from
ancient
grudge
break
into
new
mutiny
and
juliet
to
jessie
and
joseph
conrad
part
chapter
the
possessive
instinct
never
stands
still
through
florescence
and
feud
frosts
and
fires
it
followed
the
laws
of
progression
even
in
the
forsyte
family
which
had
believed
it
fixed
for
ever
nor
can
it
be
dissociated
from
environment
any
more
than
the
quality
of
potato
from
the
soil
the
historian
of
the
english
eighties
and
nineties
will
in
his
good
time
depict
the
somewhat
rapid
progression
from
and
contained
provincialism
to
still
more
if
less
contained
other
words
the
instinct
of
the
nation
on
the
move
and
so
as
if
in
conformity
was
it
with
the
forsyte
family
they
were
spreading
not
merely
on
the
surface
but
within
when
in
susan
hayman
the
married
forsyte
sister
followed
her
husband
at
the
ludicrously
low
age
of
and
was
cremated
it
made
strangely
little
stir
among
the
six
old
forsytes
left
for
this
apathy
there
were
three
causes
first
the
almost
surreptitious
burial
of
old
jolyon
in
down
at
robin
of
the
forsytes
to
desert
the
family
grave
at
highgate
that
burial
coming
a
year
after
entirely
proper
funeral
had
occasioned
a
great
deal
of
talk
on
forsyte
the
abode
of
timothy
forsyte
on
the
bayswater
road
london
which
still
collected
and
radiated
family
gossip
opinions
ranged
from
the
lamentation
of
aunt
juley
to
the
outspoken
assertion
of
francie
that
it
was
jolly
good
thing
to
stop
all
that
stuffy
highgate
business
uncle
jolyon
in
his
later
ever
since
the
strange
and
lamentable
affair
between
his
granddaughter
june
lover
young
bosinney
and
irene
his
nephew
soames
forsyte
noticeably
rapped
the
family
knuckles
and
that
way
of
his
own
which
he
had
always
taken
had
begun
to
seem
to
them
a
little
wayward
the
philosophic
vein
in
him
of
course
had
always
been
too
liable
to
crop
out
of
the
strata
of
pure
forsyteism
so
they
were
in
a
way
prepared
for
his
interment
in
a
strange
spot
but
the
whole
thing
was
an
odd
business
and
when
the
contents
of
his
will
became
current
coin
on
forsyte
a
shiver
had
gone
round
the
clan
out
of
his
estate
gross
with
liabilities
he
had
actually
left
to
whomever
do
you
think
my
dear
to
irene
that
runaway
wife
of
his
nephew
soames
irene
a
woman
who
had
almost
disgraced
the
family
more
amazing
was
to
him
no
blood
relation
not
out
and
out
of
course
only
a
life
the
income
from
it
still
there
it
was
and
old
jolyon
claim
to
be
the
perfect
forsyte
was
ended
once
for
all
that
then
was
the
first
reason
why
the
burial
of
susan
little
stir
the
second
reason
was
altogether
more
expansive
and
imperial
besides
the
house
on
campden
hill
susan
had
a
place
left
her
by
hayman
when
he
died
just
over
the
border
in
hants
where
the
hayman
boys
had
learned
to
be
such
good
shots
and
riders
as
it
was
believed
which
was
of
course
nice
for
them
and
creditable
to
everybody
and
the
fact
of
owning
something
really
countrified
seemed
somehow
to
excuse
the
dispersion
of
her
what
could
have
put
cremation
into
her
head
they
could
not
think
the
usual
invitations
however
had
been
issued
and
soames
had
gone
down
and
young
nicholas
and
the
will
had
been
quite
satisfactory
so
far
as
it
went
for
she
had
only
had
a
life
interest
and
everything
had
gone
quite
smoothly
to
the
children
in
equal
shares
the
third
reason
why
susan
burial
made
little
stir
was
the
most
expansive
of
all
it
was
summed
up
daringly
by
euphemia
the
pale
the
thin
well
i
think
people
have
a
right
to
their
own
bodies
even
when
they
coming
from
a
daughter
of
nicholas
a
liberal
of
the
old
school
and
most
tyrannical
it
was
a
startling
in
a
flash
what
a
lot
of
water
had
run
under
bridges
since
the
death
of
aunt
ann
in
just
when
the
proprietorship
of
soames
over
his
wife
body
was
acquiring
the
uncertainty
which
had
led
to
such
disaster
euphemia
of
course
spoke
like
a
child
and
had
no
experience
for
though
well
over
thirty
by
now
her
name
was
still
forsyte
but
making
all
allowances
her
remark
did
undoubtedly
show
expansion
of
the
principle
of
liberty
decentralisation
and
shift
in
the
central
point
of
possession
from
others
to
oneself
when
nicholas
heard
his
daughter
remark
from
aunt
hester
he
had
rapped
out
wives
and
daughters
there
no

to
their
liberty
in
these
days
i
knew
that
case
would
lead
to
in
habeas
corpus
like
that
he
had
of
course
never
really
forgiven
the
married
woman
property
act
which
would
so
have
interfered
with
him
if
he
had
not
mercifully
married
before
it
was
passed
but
in
truth
there
was
no
denying
the
revolt
among
the
younger
forsytes
against
being
owned
by
others
that
as
it
were
colonial
disposition
to
own
oneself
which
is
the
paradoxical
forerunner
of
imperialism
was
making
progress
all
the
time
they
were
all
now
married
except
george
confirmed
to
the
turf
and
the
iseeum

her
musical
career
in
a

off

and
still
taking
to

at

and
complaining
of

the
going
down

years
unreproduced
thus
of
the
ten
old
forsytes
young
forsytes
had
been
born
but
of
the
young
forsytes
there
were
as
yet
only
seventeen
descendants
and
it
already
seemed
unlikely
that
there
would
be
more
than
a
further
unconsidered
trifle
or
so
a
student
of
statistics
must
have
noticed
that
the
birth
rate
had
varied
in
accordance
with
the
rate
of
interest
for
your
money
grandfather
dosset
forsyte
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
had
been
getting
ten
per
cent
for
his
hence
ten
children
those
ten
leaving
out
the
four
who
had
not
married
and
juley
whose
husband
septimus
small
had
of
course
died
almost
at
once
had
averaged
from
four
to
five
per
cent
for
theirs
and
produced
accordingly
the
whom
they
produced
were
now
getting
barely
three
per
cent
in
the
consols
to
which
their
father
had
mostly
tied
the
settlements
they
made
to
avoid
death
duties
and
the
six
of
them
who
had
been
reproduced
had
seventeen
children
or
just
the
proper
two
and
per
stem
there
were
other
reasons
too
for
this
mild
reproduction
a
distrust
of
their
earning
powers
natural
where
a
sufficiency
is
guaranteed
together
with
the
knowledge
that
their
fathers
did
not
die
kept
them
cautious
if
one
had
children
and
not
much
income
the
standard
of
taste
and
comfort
must
of
necessity
go
down
what
was
enough
for
two
was
not
enough
for
four
and
so
would
be
better
to
wait
and
see
what
father
did
besides
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
take
holidays
unhampered
sooner
in
fact
than
own
children
they
preferred
to
concentrate
on
the
ownership
of
themselves
conforming
to
the
growing
tendency
fin
de
siecle
as
it
was
called
in
this
way
little
risk
was
run
and
one
would
be
able
to
have
a
indeed
eustace
already
had
one
but
it
had
shaken
him
horribly
and
broken
one
of
his
eye
teeth
so
that
it
would
be
better
to
wait
till
they
were
a
little
safer
in
the
meantime
no
more
children
even
young
nicholas
was
drawing
in
his
horns
and
had
made
no
addition
to
his
six
for
quite
three
years
the
corporate
decay
however
of
the
forsytes
their
dispersion
rather
of
which
all
this
was
symptomatic
had
not
advanced
so
far
as
to
prevent
a
rally
when
roger
forsyte
died
in
it
had
been
a
glorious
summer
and
after
holidays
abroad
and
at
the
sea
they
were
practically
all
back
in
london
when
roger
with
a
touch
of
his
old
originality
had
suddenly
breathed
his
last
at
his
own
house
in
princes
gardens
at
timothy
it
was
whispered
sadly
that
poor
roger
had
always
been
eccentric
about
his
he
not
for
instance
preferred
german
mutton
to
all
the
other
brands
be
that
as
it
may
his
funeral
at
highgate
had
been
perfect
and
coming
away
from
it
soames
forsyte
made
almost
mechanically
for
his
uncle
timothy
in
the
bayswater
road
the
juley
and
aunt
like
to
hear
about
it
his
had
not
felt
up
to
the
fatigue
of
the
funeral
and
timothy
himself
of
course
had
not
gone
so
that
nicholas
had
been
the
only
brother
present
still
there
had
been
a
fair
gathering
and
it
would
cheer
aunts
juley
and
hester
up
to
know
the
kindly
thought
was
not
unmixed
with
the
inevitable
longing
to
get
something
out
of
everything
you
do
which
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
forsytes
and
indeed
of
the
saner
elements
in
every
nation
in
this
practice
of
taking
family
matters
to
timothy
in
the
bayswater
road
soames
was
but
following
in
the
footsteps
of
his
father
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
going
at
least
once
a
week
to
see
his
sisters
at
timothy
and
had
only
given
it
up
when
he
lost
his
nerve
at
and
could
not
go
out
without
emily
to
go
with
emily
was
of
no
use
for
who
could
really
talk
to
anyone
in
the
presence
of
his
own
wife
like
james
in
the
old
days
soames
found
time
to
go
there
nearly
every
sunday
and
sit
in
the
little
into
which
with
his
undoubted
taste
he
had
introduced
a
good
deal
of
change
and
china
not
quite
up
to
his
own
fastidious
mark
and
at
least
two
rather
doubtful
barbizon
pictures
at
christmastides
he
himself
who
had
done
extremely
well
with
the
barbizons
had
for
some
years
past
moved
towards
the
marises
israels
and
mauve
and
was
hoping
to
do
better
in
the
riverside
house
which
he
now
inhabited
near
mapledurham
he
had
a
gallery
beautifully
hung
and
lighted
to
which
few
london
dealers
were
strangers
it
served
too
as
a
sunday
afternoon
attraction
in
those
parties
which
his
sisters
winifred
or
rachel
occasionally
organised
for
him
for
though
he
was
but
a
taciturn
showman
his
quiet
collected
determinism
seldom
failed
to
influence
his
guests
who
knew
that
his
reputation
was
grounded
not
on
mere
aesthetic
fancy
but
on
his
power
of
gauging
the
future
of
market
values
when
he
went
to
timothy
he
almost
always
had
some
little
tale
of
triumph
over
a
dealer
to
unfold
and
dearly
he
loved
that
coo
of
pride
with
which
his
aunts
would
greet
it
this
afternoon
however
he
was
differently
animated
coming
from
roger
funeral
in
his
neat
dark
quite
black
for
after
all
an
uncle
was
but
an
uncle
and
his
soul
abhorred
excessive
display
of
feeling
leaning
back
in
a
marqueterie
chair
and
gazing
down
his
uplifted
nose
at
the
walls
plastered
with
gold
frames
he
was
noticeably
silent
whether
because
he
had
been
to
a
funeral
or
not
the
peculiar
forsyte
build
of
his
face
was
seen
to
the
best
advantage
this
face
concave
and
long
with
a
jaw
which
divested
of
flesh
would
have
seemed
extravagant
altogether
a
chinny
face
though
not
at
all
he
was
feeling
more
strongly
than
ever
that
timothy
was
hopelessly
and
the
souls
of
his
aunts
dismally
the
subject
on
which
alone
he
wanted
to
own
undivorced
unspeakable
and
yet
it
occupied
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
it
was
only
since
the
spring
that
this
had
been
so
and
a
new
feeling
grown
up
which
was
egging
him
on
towards
what
he
knew
might
well
be
folly
in
a
forsyte
of
more
and
more
of
late
he
had
been
conscious
that
he
was
on
the
fortune
already
considerable
when
he
conceived
the
house
at
robin
hill
which
had
finally
wrecked
his
marriage
with
irene
had
mounted
with
surprising
vigour
in
the
twelve
lonely
years
during
which
he
had
devoted
himself
to
little
else
he
was
worth
well
over
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
had
no
one
to
leave
it
real
object
for
going
on
with
what
was
his
religion
even
if
he
were
to
relax
his
efforts
money
made
money
and
he
felt
that
he
would
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
before
he
knew
where
he
was
there
had
always
been
a
strongly
domestic
philoprogenitive
side
to
soames
baulked
and
frustrated
it
had
hidden
itself
away
but
now
had
crept
out
again
in
this
his
of
life
concreted
and
focussed
of
late
by
the
attraction
of
a
girl
undoubted
beauty
it
had
become
a
veritable
prepossession
and
this
girl
was
french
not
likely
to
lose
her
head
or
accept
any
unlegalised
position
moreover
soames
himself
disliked
the
thought
of
that
he
had
tasted
of
the
sordid
side
of
sex
during
those
long
years
of
forced
celibacy
secretively
and
always
with
disgust
for
he
was
fastidious
and
his
sense
of
law
and
order
innate
he
wanted
no
hole
and
corner
liaison
a
marriage
at
the
embassy
in
paris
a
few
travel
and
he
could
bring
annette
back
quite
separated
from
a
past
which
in
truth
was
not
too
distinguished
for
she
only
kept
the
accounts
in
her
mother
soho
restaurant
he
could
bring
her
back
as
something
very
new
and
chic
with
her
french
taste
and
to
reign
at
shelter
near
mapledurham
on
forsyte
and
among
his
riverside
friends
it
would
be
current
that
he
had
met
a
charming
french
girl
on
his
travels
and
married
her
there
would
be
the
flavour
of
romance
and
a
certain
cachet
about
a
french
wife
no
he
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
that
it
was
only
this
cursed
undivorced
condition
of
his
the
question
whether
annette
would
take
him
which
he
dared
not
put
to
the
touch
until
he
had
a
clear
and
even
dazzling
future
to
offer
her
in
his
aunts
he
heard
with
but
muffled
ears
those
usual
questions
how
was
his
dear
father
not
going
out
of
course
now
that
the
weather
was
turning
chilly
would
soames
be
sure
to
tell
him
that
hester
had
found
boiled
holly
leaves
most
comforting
for
that
pain
in
her
side
a
poultice
every
three
hours
with
red
flannel
afterwards
and
could
he
relish
just
a
little
pot
of
their
very
best
prune
was
so
delicious
this
year
and
had
such
a
wonderful
effect
oh
and
about
the
soames
heard
that
dear
winifred
was
having
a
most
distressing
time
with
montague
timothy
thought
she
really
ought
to
have
protection
it
was
soames
must
take
this
for
he
had
given
some
of
winifred
jewellery
to
a
dreadful
dancer
it
was
such
a
bad
example
for
dear
val
just
as
he
was
going
to
college
soames
had
not
heard
oh
but
he
must
go
and
see
his
sister
and
look
into
it
at
once
and
did
he
think
these
boers
were
really
going
to
resist
timothy
was
in
quite
a
stew
about
it
the
price
of
consols
was
so
high
and
he
had
such
a
lot
of
money
in
them
did
soames
think
they
must
go
down
if
there
was
a
war
soames
nodded
but
it
would
be
over
very
quickly
it
would
be
so
bad
for
timothy
if
it
was
and
of
course
soames
dear
father
would
feel
it
very
much
at
his
age
luckily
poor
dear
roger
had
been
spared
this
dreadful
anxiety
and
aunt
juley
with
a
little
handkerchief
wiped
away
the
large
tear
trying
to
climb
the
permanent
pout
on
her
now
quite
withered
left
cheek
she
was
remembering
dear
roger
and
all
his
originality
and
how
he
used
to
stick
pins
into
her
when
they
were
little
together
aunt
hester
with
her
instinct
for
avoiding
the
unpleasant
here
chimed
in
did
soames
think
they
would
make
chamberlain
prime
minister
at
once
he
would
settle
it
all
so
quickly
she
would
like
to
see
that
old
kruger
sent
to
helena
she
could
remember
so
well
the
news
of
napoleon
death
and
what
a
relief
it
had
been
to
his
grandfather
of
course
she
and
we
were
in
pantalettes
then
my
dear
not
felt
it
much
at
the
time
soames
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
her
drank
it
quickly
and
ate
three
of
those
macaroons
for
which
timothy
was
famous
his
faint
pale
supercilious
smile
had
deepened
just
a
little
really
his
family
remained
hopelessly
provincial
however
much
of
london
they
might
possess
between
them
in
these
days
their
provincialism
stared
out
even
more
than
it
used
to
why
old
nicholas
was
still
a
free
trader
and
a
member
of
that
antediluvian
home
of
liberalism
the
remove
to
be
sure
the
members
were
pretty
well
all
conservatives
now
or
he
himself
could
not
have
joined
and
timothy
they
said
still
wore
a
nightcap
aunt
juley
spoke
again
dear
soames
was
looking
so
well
hardly
a
day
older
than
he
did
when
dear
ann
died
and
they
were
all
there
together
dear
jolyon
and
dear
swithin
and
dear
roger
she
paused
and
caught
the
tear
which
had
climbed
the
pout
on
her
right
cheek
did
he
ever
hear
anything
of
irene
nowadays
aunt
hester
visibly
interposed
her
shoulder
really
juley
was
always
saying
something
the
smile
left
soames
face
and
he
put
his
cup
down
here
was
his
subject
broached
for
him
and
for
all
his
desire
to
expand
he
could
not
take
advantage
aunt
juley
went
on
rather
hastily
they
say
dear
jolyon
first
left
her
that
fifteen
thousand
out
and
out
then
of
course
he
saw
it
would
not
be
right
and
made
it
for
her
life
had
soames
heard
that
soames
nodded
your
cousin
jolyon
is
a
widower
now
he
is
her
trustee
you
knew
that
of
course
soames
shook
his
head
he
did
know
but
wished
to
show
no
interest
young
jolyon
and
he
had
not
met
since
the
day
of
bosinney
death
he
must
be
quite
by
now
went
on
aunt
juley
dreamily
let
me
see
he
was
born
when
your
dear
uncle
lived
in
mount
street
long
before
they
went
to
stanhope
gate
in
december
just
before
that
dreadful
commune
over
fifty
fancy
that
such
a
pretty
baby
and
we
were
all
so
proud
of
him
the
very
first
of
you
aunt
juley
sighed
and
a
lock
of
not
quite
her
own
hair
came
loose
and
straggled
so
that
aunt
hester
gave
a
little
shiver
soames
rose
he
was
experiencing
a
curious
piece
of
that
old
wound
to
his
pride
and
was
not
yet
closed
he
had
come
thinking
he
could
talk
of
it
even
wanting
to
talk
of
his
fettered
condition
he
was
shrinking
away
from
this
reminder
by
aunt
juley
renowned
for
her
malapropisms
oh
soames
was
not
going
already
soames
smiled
a
little
vindictively
and
said
yes
remember
me
to
uncle
timothy
and
leaving
a
cold
kiss
on
each
forehead
whose
wrinkles
seemed
to
try
and
cling
to
his
lips
as
if
longing
to
be
kissed
away
he
left
them
looking
brightly
after
soames
it
had
been
so
good
of
him
to
come
when
they
were
not
feeling
very
with
compunction
tweaking
at
his
chest
soames
descended
the
stairs
where
was
always
that
rather
pleasant
smell
of
camphor
and
port
wine
and
house
where
draughts
are
not
permitted
the
poor
old
had
not
meant
to
be
unkind
and
in
the
street
he
instantly
forgot
them
repossessed
by
the
image
of
annette
and
the
thought
of
the
cursed
coil
around
him
why
had
he
not
pushed
the
thing
through
and
obtained
divorce
when
that
wretched
bosinney
was
run
over
and
there
was
evidence
galore
for
the
asking
and
he
turned
towards
his
sister
winifred
residence
in
green
street
mayfair
chapter
a
man
of
the
world
that
a
man
of
the
world
so
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
of
fortunes
as
montague
dartie
should
still
be
living
in
a
house
he
had
inhabited
twenty
years
at
least
would
have
been
more
noticeable
if
the
rent
rates
taxes
and
repairs
of
that
house
had
not
been
defrayed
by
his
by
that
simple
if
wholesale
device
james
forsyte
had
secured
a
certain
stability
in
the
lives
of
his
daughter
and
his
grandchildren
after
all
there
is
something
invaluable
about
a
safe
roof
over
the
head
of
a
sportsman
so
dashing
as
dartie
until
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
he
had
been
steady
all
this
year
the
fact
was
he
had
acquired
a
half
share
in
a
filly
of
george
forsyte
who
had
gone
irreparably
on
the
turf
to
the
horror
of
roger
now
stilled
by
the
grave
by
martyr
out
of
by
suspender
was
a
bay
filly
three
years
old
who
for
a
variety
of
reasons
had
never
shown
her
true
form
with
half
ownership
of
this
hopeful
animal
all
the
idealism
latent
somewhere
in
dartie
as
in
every
other
man
had
put
up
its
head
and
kept
him
quietly
ardent
for
months
past
when
a
man
has
some
thing
good
to
live
for
it
is
astonishing
how
sober
he
becomes
and
what
dartie
had
was
really
three
to
one
chance
for
an
autumn
handicap
publicly
assessed
at
to
one
the
heaven
was
a
poor
thing
beside
it
and
his
shirt
was
on
the
daughter
of
but
how
much
more
than
his
shirt
depended
on
this
granddaughter
of
suspender
at
that
roving
age
of
trying
to
though
perhaps
less
distinguishable
from
any
other
age
trying
even
to
had
fixed
his
current
fancy
on
a
dancer
it
was
no
mean
passion
but
without
money
and
a
good
deal
of
it
likely
to
remain
a
love
as
airy
as
her
skirts
and
dartie
never
had
any
money
subsisting
miserably
on
what
he
could
beg
or
borrow
from
woman
of
character
who
kept
him
because
he
was
the
father
of
her
children
and
from
a
lingering
admiration
for
those
wardour
street
good
looks
which
in
their
youth
had
fascinated
her
she
together
with
anyone
else
who
would
lend
him
anything
and
his
losses
at
cards
and
on
the
turf
extraordinary
how
some
men
make
a
good
thing
out
of
losses
were
his
whole
means
of
subsistence
for
james
was
now
too
old
and
nervous
to
approach
and
soames
too
formidably
adamant
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
dartie
had
been
living
on
hope
for
months
he
had
never
been
fond
of
money
for
itself
had
always
despised
the
forsytes
with
their
investing
habits
though
careful
to
make
such
use
of
them
as
he
could
what
he
liked
about
money
was
what
it
sensation
no
real
sportsman
cares
for
money
he
would
say
borrowing
a
if
it
was
no
use
trying
for
a
there
was
something
delicious
about
montague
dartie
he
was
as
george
forsyte
said
a
the
morning
of
the
handicap
dawned
clear
and
bright
the
last
day
of
september
and
dartie
who
had
travelled
to
newmarket
the
night
before
arrayed
himself
in
spotless
checks
and
walked
to
an
eminence
to
see
his
half
of
the
filly
take
her
final
canter
if
she
won
he
would
be
a
cool
three
thou
in
poor
enough
recompense
for
the
sobriety
and
patience
of
these
weeks
of
hope
while
they
had
been
nursing
her
for
this
race
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
afford
more
should
he
it
off
at
the
eight
to
one
to
which
she
had
advanced
this
was
his
single
thought
while
the
larks
sang
above
him
and
the
grassy
downs
smelled
sweet
and
the
pretty
filly
passed
tossing
her
head
and
glowing
like
satin
after
all
if
he
lost
it
would
not
be
he
who
paid
and
to
it
would
reduce
his
winnings
to
some
fifteen
enough
to
purchase
a
dancer
out
and
out
even
more
potent
was
the
itch
in
the
blood
of
all
the
darties
for
a
real
flutter
and
turning
to
george
he
said
she
a
clipper
she
win
hands
down
i
shall
go
the
whole
george
who
had
laid
off
every
penny
and
a
few
besides
and
stood
to
win
however
it
came
out
grinned
down
on
him
from
his
bulky
height
with
the
words
so
ho
my
wild
one
for
after
a
chequered
apprenticeship
weathered
with
the
money
of
a
deeply
complaining
roger
his
forsyte
blood
was
beginning
to
stand
him
in
good
stead
in
the
profession
of
owner
there
are
moments
of
disillusionment
in
the
lives
of
men
from
which
the
sensitive
recorder
shrinks
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
good
thing
fell
down
finished
in
the
ruck
dartie
shirt
was
lost
between
the
passing
of
these
things
and
the
day
when
soames
turned
his
face
towards
green
street
what
had
not
happened
when
a
man
with
the
constitution
of
montague
dartie
has
exercised
for
months
from
religious
motives
and
remains
unrewarded
he
does
not
curse
god
and
die
he
curses
god
and
lives
to
the
distress
of
his
family
plucky
woman
if
a
little
too
had
borne
the
brunt
of
him
for
exactly
years
had
never
really
believed
that
he
would
do
what
he
now
did
like
so
many
wives
she
thought
she
knew
the
worst
but
she
had
not
yet
known
him
in
his
year
when
he
like
other
men
felt
that
it
was
now
or
never
paying
on
the
of
october
a
visit
of
inspection
to
her
jewel
case
she
was
horrified
to
observe
that
her
woman
crown
and
glory
was
pearls
which
montague
had
given
her
in
when
benedict
was
born
and
which
james
had
been
compelled
to
pay
for
in
the
spring
of
to
save
scandal
she
consulted
her
husband
at
once
he
the
matter
they
would
turn
up
nor
till
she
said
sharply
very
well
then
monty
i
shall
go
down
to
scotland
yard
myself
did
he
consent
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
alas
that
the
steady
and
resolved
continuity
of
design
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
sweeping
operations
should
be
liable
to
interruption
by
drink
that
night
dartie
returned
home
without
a
care
in
the
world
or
a
particle
of
reticence
under
normal
conditions
winifred
would
merely
have
locked
her
door
and
let
him
sleep
it
off
but
torturing
suspense
about
her
pearls
had
caused
her
to
wait
up
for
him
taking
a
small
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
holding
on
to
the
dining
table
he
told
her
at
once
that
he
did
not
care
a
cursh
whether
she
lived
as
she
was
quiet
but
he
himself
wash
tired
o
life
winifred
holding
onto
the
other
side
of
the
dining
table
answered
do
be
a
clown
monty
have
you
been
to
scotland
yard
placing
the
revolver
against
his
chest
dartie
had
pulled
the
trigger
several
times
it
was
not
loaded
dropping
it
with
an
imprecation
he
had
muttered
for
shake
o
the
children
and
sank
into
a
chair
winifred
having
picked
up
the
revolver
gave
him
some
soda
water
the
liquor
had
a
magical
effect
life
had
illused
him
winifred
had
never
if
he
had
the
right
to
take
the
pearls
he
had
given
her
himself
who
had
that
spanish
filly
had
got
if
winifred
had
any
he
w
what
was
the
matter
with
that
probably
the
first
use
of
that
celebrated
obscure
are
the
origins
of
even
the
most
classical
language
winifred
who
had
learned
in
a
hard
school
looked
up
at
him
and
said
spanish
filly
do
you
mean
that
girl
we
saw
dancing
in
the
pandemonium
ballet
well
you
are
a
thief
and
a
it
had
been
the
last
straw
on
a
sorely
loaded
consciousness
reaching
up
from
his
chair
dartie
seized
his
wife
arm
and
recalling
the
achievements
of
his
boyhood
twisted
it
winifred
endured
the
agony
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
no
murmur
watching
for
a
moment
of
weakness
she
wrenched
it
free
then
placing
the
dining
table
between
them
said
between
her
teeth
you
are
the
limit
undoubtedly
the
inception
of
that
is
english
formed
under
the
stress
of
circumstances
leaving
dartie
with
foam
on
his
dark
moustache
she
went
upstairs
and
after
locking
her
door
and
bathing
her
arm
in
hot
water
lay
awake
all
night
thinking
of
her
pearls
adorning
the
neck
of
another
and
of
the
consideration
her
husband
had
presumably
received
therefor
the
man
of
the
world
awoke
with
a
sense
of
being
lost
to
that
world
and
a
dim
recollection
of
having
been
called
a
he
sat
for
half
an
hour
in
the
dawn
and
the
armchair
where
he
had
the
unhappiest
he
had
ever
spent
for
even
to
a
dartie
there
is
something
tragic
about
an
end
and
he
knew
that
he
had
reached
it
never
again
would
he
sleep
in
his
and
wake
with
the
light
filtering
through
those
curtains
bought
by
winifred
at
nickens
and
jarveys
with
the
money
of
james
never
again
eat
a
devilled
kidney
at
that
table
after
a
roll
in
the
sheets
and
a
hot
bath
he
took
his
note
case
from
his
dress
coat
pocket
four
hundred
pounds
in
fives
and
remainder
of
the
proceeds
of
his
half
of
sold
last
night
cash
down
to
george
forsyte
who
having
won
over
the
race
had
not
conceived
the
sudden
dislike
to
the
animal
which
he
himself
now
felt
the
ballet
was
going
to
buenos
aires
the
day
after
and
he
was
going
too
full
value
for
the
pearls
had
not
yet
been
received
he
was
only
at
the
soup
he
stole
upstairs
not
daring
to
have
a
bath
or
shave
besides
the
water
would
be
cold
he
changed
his
clothes
and
packed
stealthily
all
he
could
it
was
hard
to
leave
so
many
shining
boots
but
one
must
sacrifice
something
then
carrying
a
valise
in
either
hand
he
stepped
out
onto
the
landing
the
house
was
very
house
where
he
had
begotten
his
four
children
it
was
a
curious
moment
this
outside
the
room
of
his
wife
once
admired
if
not
perhaps
loved
who
had
called
him
limit
he
steeled
himself
with
that
phrase
and
tiptoed
on
but
the
next
door
was
harder
to
pass
it
was
the
room
his
daughters
slept
in
maud
was
at
school
but
imogen
would
be
lying
there
and
moisture
came
into
dartie
early
morning
eyes
she
was
the
most
like
him
of
the
four
with
her
dark
hair
and
her
luscious
brown
glance
just
coming
out
a
pretty
thing
he
set
down
the
two
valises
this
almost
formal
abdication
of
fatherhood
hurt
him
the
morning
light
fell
on
a
face
which
worked
with
real
emotion
nothing
so
false
as
penitence
moved
him
but
genuine
paternal
feeling
and
that
melancholy
of
again
he
moistened
his
lips
and
complete
irresolution
for
a
moment
paralysed
his
legs
in
their
check
trousers
it
was
to
be
thus
compelled
to
leave
his
home
he
muttered
i
never
thought
it
would
come
to
noises
above
warned
him
that
the
maids
were
beginning
to
get
up
and
grasping
the
two
valises
he
tiptoed
on
downstairs
his
cheeks
were
wet
and
the
knowledge
of
that
was
comforting
as
though
it
guaranteed
the
genuineness
of
his
sacrifice
he
lingered
a
little
in
the
rooms
below
to
pack
all
the
cigars
he
had
some
papers
a
crush
hat
a
silver
cigarette
box
a
ruff
guide
then
mixing
himself
a
stiff
whisky
and
soda
and
lighting
a
cigarette
he
stood
hesitating
before
a
photograph
of
his
two
girls
in
a
silver
frame
it
belonged
to
winifred
mind
he
thought
can
get
another
taken
and
i
ca
he
slipped
it
into
the
valise
then
putting
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
he
took
two
others
his
best
malacca
cane
an
umbrella
and
opened
the
front
door
closing
it
softly
behind
him
he
walked
out
burdened
as
he
had
never
been
in
all
his
life
and
made
his
way
round
the
corner
to
wait
there
for
an
early
cab
to
come
by
thus
had
passed
montague
dartie
in
the
year
of
his
age
from
the
house
which
he
had
called
his
own
when
winifred
came
down
and
realised
that
he
was
not
in
the
house
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
dull
anger
that
he
should
thus
elude
the
reproaches
she
had
carefully
prepared
in
those
long
wakeful
hours
he
had
gone
off
to
newmarket
or
brighton
with
that
woman
as
likely
as
not
disgusting
forced
to
a
complete
reticence
before
imogen
and
the
servants
and
aware
that
her
father
nerves
would
never
stand
the
disclosure
she
had
been
unable
to
refrain
from
going
to
timothy
that
afternoon
and
pouring
out
the
story
of
the
pearls
to
aunts
juley
and
hester
in
utter
confidence
it
was
only
on
the
following
morning
that
she
noticed
the
disappearance
of
that
photograph
what
did
it
mean
careful
examination
of
her
husband
relics
prompted
the
thought
that
he
had
gone
for
good
as
that
conclusion
hardened
she
stood
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
his
with
all
the
drawers
pulled
out
to
try
and
realise
what
she
was
feeling
by
no
means
easy
though
he
was
limit
he
was
yet
her
property
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
but
feel
the
poorer
to
be
widowed
yet
not
widowed
at
with
four
children
made
conspicuous
an
object
of
commiseration
gone
to
the
arms
of
a
spanish
jade
memories
feelings
which
she
had
thought
quite
dead
revived
within
her
painful
sullen
tenacious
mechanically
she
closed
drawer
after
drawer
went
to
her
bed
lay
on
it
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillows
she
did
not
cry
what
was
the
use
of
that
when
she
got
off
her
bed
to
go
down
to
lunch
she
felt
as
if
only
one
thing
could
do
her
good
and
that
was
to
have
val
home
eldest
was
to
go
to
oxford
next
month
at
james
expense
was
at
littlehampton
taking
his
final
gallops
with
his
trainer
for
smalls
as
he
would
have
phrased
it
following
his
father
diction
she
caused
a
telegram
to
be
sent
to
him
i
must
see
about
his
clothes
she
said
to
imogen
i
ca
have
him
going
up
to
oxford
all
anyhow
those
boys
are
so
val
got
heaps
of
things
imogen
answered
i
know
but
they
want
overhauling
i
hope
he
he
come
like
a
shot
mother
but
he
probably
skew
his
i
ca
help
that
said
winifred
i
want
with
an
innocent
shrewd
look
at
her
mother
face
imogen
kept
silence
it
was
father
of
course
val
did
come
a
shot
at
six
imagine
a
cross
between
a
pickle
and
a
forsyte
and
you
have
young
publius
valerius
dartie
a
youth
so
named
could
hardly
turn
out
otherwise
when
he
was
born
winifred
in
the
heyday
of
spirits
and
the
craving
for
distinction
had
determined
that
her
children
should
have
names
such
as
no
others
had
ever
had
it
was
a
felt
she
had
just
not
named
imogen
thisbe
but
it
was
to
george
forsyte
always
a
wag
that
val
christening
was
due
it
so
happened
that
dartie
dining
with
him
a
week
after
the
birth
of
his
son
and
heir
had
mentioned
this
aspiration
of
winifred
call
him
cato
said
george
it
be
damned
piquant
he
had
just
won
a
tenner
on
a
horse
of
that
name
cato
dartie
had
were
a
little
as
the
phrase
was
even
in
those
it
not
a
christian
halo
you
george
called
to
a
waiter
in
knee
breeches
bring
me
the
brit
from
the
library
letter
the
waiter
brought
it
here
you
are
said
george
pointing
with
his
cigar
cato
publius
valerius
by
virgil
out
of
lydia
that
what
you
want
publius
valerius
is
christian
dartie
on
arriving
home
had
informed
winifred
she
had
been
charmed
it
was
so
and
publius
valerius
became
the
baby
name
though
it
afterwards
transpired
that
they
had
got
hold
of
the
inferior
cato
in
however
when
little
publius
was
nearly
ten
the
word
went
out
of
fashion
and
sobriety
came
in
winifred
began
to
have
doubts
they
were
confirmed
by
little
publius
himself
who
returned
from
his
first
term
at
school
complaining
that
life
was
a
burden
to
called
him
pubby
woman
of
real
changed
his
school
and
his
name
to
val
the
publius
being
dropped
even
as
an
initial
at
nineteen
he
was
a
limber
freckled
youth
with
a
wide
mouth
light
eyes
long
dark
lashes
a
rather
charming
smile
considerable
knowledge
of
what
he
should
not
know
and
no
experience
of
what
he
ought
to
do
few
boys
had
more
narrowly
escaped
being
engaging
rascal
after
kissing
his
mother
and
pinching
imogen
he
ran
upstairs
three
at
a
time
and
came
down
four
dressed
for
dinner
he
was
awfully
sorry
but
his
who
had
come
up
too
had
asked
him
to
dine
at
the
oxford
and
cambridge
it
would
do
to
old
chap
would
be
hurt
winifred
let
him
go
with
an
unhappy
pride
she
had
wanted
him
at
home
but
it
was
very
nice
to
know
that
his
tutor
was
so
fond
of
him
he
went
out
with
a
wink
at
imogen
saying
i
say
mother
could
i
have
two
plover
eggs
when
i
come
in
got
some
they
top
up
so
jolly
well
oh
and
look
you
any
money
had
to
borrow
a
fiver
from
old
winifred
looking
at
him
with
fond
shrewdness
answered
my
dear
you
are
naughty
about
money
but
you
should
pay
him
anyway
you
his
guest
how
nice
and
slim
he
looked
in
his
white
waistcoat
and
his
dark
thick
lashes
oh
but
we
may
go
to
the
theatre
you
see
mother
and
i
think
i
ought
to
stand
the
tickets
he
always
hard
up
you
winifred
produced
a
note
saying
well
perhaps
you
better
pay
him
but
you
must
stand
the
tickets
val
pocketed
the
fiver
if
i
do
i
ca
he
said
mum
he
went
out
with
his
head
up
and
his
hat
cocked
joyously
sniffing
the
air
of
piccadilly
like
a
young
hound
loosed
into
covert
jolly
good
biz
after
that
mouldy
old
slow
hole
down
there
he
found
his
not
indeed
at
the
oxford
and
cambridge
but
at
the
goat
club
this
was
a
year
older
than
himself
a
youth
with
fine
brown
eyes
and
smooth
dark
hair
a
small
mouth
an
oval
face
languid
immaculate
cool
to
a
degree
one
of
those
young
men
who
without
effort
establish
moral
ascendancy
over
their
companions
he
had
missed
being
expelled
from
school
a
year
before
val
had
spent
that
year
at
oxford
and
val
could
almost
see
a
halo
round
his
head
his
name
was
crum
and
no
one
could
get
through
money
quicker
it
seemed
to
be
his
only
aim
in
to
young
val
in
whom
however
the
forsyte
would
stand
apart
now
and
then
wondering
where
the
value
for
that
money
was
they
dined
quietly
in
style
and
taste
left
the
club
smoking
cigars
with
just
two
bottles
inside
them
and
dropped
into
stalls
at
the
liberty
for
val
the
sound
of
comic
songs
the
sight
of
lovely
legs
were
fogged
and
interrupted
by
haunting
fears
that
he
would
never
equal
crum
quiet
dandyism
his
idealism
was
roused
and
when
that
is
so
one
is
never
quite
at
ease
surely
he
had
too
wide
a
mouth
not
the
best
cut
of
waistcoat
no
braid
on
his
trousers
and
his
lavender
gloves
had
no
thin
black
stitchings
down
the
back
besides
he
laughed
too
never
laughed
he
only
smiled
with
his
regular
dark
brows
raised
a
little
so
that
they
formed
a
gable
over
his
just
drooped
lids
no
he
would
never
be
crum
equal
all
the
same
it
was
a
jolly
good
show
and
cynthia
dark
simply
ripping
between
the
acts
crum
regaled
him
with
particulars
of
cynthia
private
life
and
the
awful
knowledge
became
val
that
if
he
liked
crum
could
go
behind
he
simply
longed
to
say
i
say
take
me
but
dared
not
because
of
his
deficiencies
and
this
made
the
last
act
or
two
almost
miserable
on
coming
out
crum
said
it
half
an
hour
before
they
close
let
go
on
to
the
they
took
a
hansom
to
travel
the
hundred
yards
and
seats
costing
apiece
because
they
were
going
to
stand
and
walked
into
the
promenade
it
was
in
these
little
things
this
utter
negligence
of
money
that
crum
had
such
engaging
polish
the
ballet
was
on
its
last
legs
and
night
and
the
traffic
of
the
promenade
was
suffering
for
the
moment
men
and
women
were
crowded
in
three
rows
against
the
barrier
the
whirl
and
dazzle
on
the
stage
the
half
dark
the
mingled
tobacco
fumes
and
women
scent
all
that
curious
lure
to
promiscuity
which
belongs
to
promenades
began
to
free
young
val
from
his
idealism
he
looked
admiringly
in
a
young
woman
face
saw
she
was
not
young
and
quickly
looked
away
shades
of
cynthia
dark
the
young
woman
arm
touched
his
unconsciously
there
was
a
scent
of
musk
and
mignonette
val
looked
round
the
corner
of
his
lashes
perhaps
she
was
young
after
all
her
foot
trod
on
his
she
begged
his
pardon
he
said
not
at
all
jolly
good
ballet
is
it
oh
i
tired
of
it
are
you
young
val
wide
rather
charming
smile
beyond
that
he
did
not
yet
convinced
the
forsyte
in
him
stood
out
for
greater
certainty
and
on
the
stage
the
ballet
whirled
its
kaleidoscope
of
and
and
violet
and
seemed
suddenly
to
freeze
into
a
stilly
spangled
pyramid
applause
broke
out
and
it
was
over
maroon
curtains
had
cut
it
off
the
of
men
and
women
round
the
barrier
broke
up
the
young
woman
arm
pressed
his
a
little
way
off
disturbance
seemed
centring
round
a
man
with
a
pink
carnation
val
stole
another
glance
at
the
young
woman
who
was
looking
towards
it
three
men
unsteady
emerged
walking
arm
in
arm
the
one
in
the
centre
wore
the
pink
carnation
a
white
waistcoat
a
dark
moustache
he
reeled
a
little
as
he
walked
crum
voice
said
slow
and
level
look
at
that
bounder
he
screwed
val
turned
to
look
the
had
disengaged
his
arm
and
was
pointing
straight
at
them
crum
voice
level
as
ever
said
he
seems
to
know
you
the
spoke
he
said
you
look
there
my
young
rascal
of
a
son
val
saw
it
was
his
father
he
could
have
sunk
into
the
crimson
carpet
it
was
not
the
meeting
in
this
place
not
even
that
his
father
was
it
was
crum
word
which
as
by
heavenly
revelation
he
perceived
at
that
moment
to
be
true
yes
his
father
looked
a
bounder
with
his
dark
good
looks
and
his
pink
carnation
and
his
square
walk
and
without
a
word
he
ducked
behind
the
young
woman
and
slipped
out
of
the
promenade
he
heard
the
word
val
behind
him
and
ran
down
steps
past
the
into
the
square
to
be
ashamed
of
his
own
father
is
perhaps
the
bitterest
experience
a
young
man
can
go
through
it
seemed
to
val
hurrying
away
that
his
career
had
ended
before
it
had
begun
how
could
he
go
up
to
oxford
now
amongst
all
those
chaps
those
splendid
friends
of
crum
who
would
know
that
his
father
was
a
and
suddenly
he
hated
crum
who
the
devil
was
crum
to
say
that
if
crum
had
been
beside
him
at
that
moment
he
would
certainly
have
been
jostled
off
the
pavement
his
own
own
a
choke
came
up
in
his
throat
and
he
dashed
his
hands
down
deep
into
his
overcoat
pockets
damn
crum
he
conceived
the
wild
idea
of
running
back
and
fending
his
father
taking
him
by
the
arm
and
walking
about
with
him
in
front
of
crum
but
gave
it
up
at
once
and
pursued
his
way
down
piccadilly
a
young
woman
planted
herself
before
him
not
so
angry
darling
he
shied
dodged
her
and
suddenly
became
quite
cool
if
crum
ever
said
a
word
he
would
jolly
well
punch
his
head
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
he
walked
a
hundred
yards
or
more
contented
with
that
thought
then
lost
its
comfort
utterly
it
was
simple
like
that
he
remembered
how
at
school
when
some
parent
came
down
who
did
not
pass
the
standard
it
just
clung
to
the
fellow
afterwards
it
was
one
of
those
things
nothing
could
remove
why
had
his
mother
married
his
father
if
he
was
a
it
was
bitterly
on
a
fellow
to
give
him
a
for
father
the
worst
of
it
was
that
now
crum
had
spoken
the
word
he
realised
that
he
had
long
known
subconsciously
that
his
father
was
not
clean
potato
it
was
the
beastliest
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
any
fellow
and
as
he
had
never
yet
been
he
came
to
green
street
and
let
himself
in
with
a
smuggled
in
the
his
eggs
were
set
invitingly
with
some
cut
bread
and
butter
and
a
little
whisky
at
the
bottom
of
a
enough
as
winifred
had
thought
for
him
to
feel
himself
a
man
it
made
him
sick
to
look
at
them
and
he
went
upstairs
winifred
heard
him
pass
and
thought
dear
boy
in
thank
goodness
if
he
takes
after
his
father
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
but
he
wo
he
like
me
dear
val
chapter
prepares
to
take
steps
when
soames
entered
his
sister
little
louis
quinze
with
its
small
balcony
always
flowered
with
hanging
geraniums
in
the
summer
and
now
with
pots
of
lilium
auratum
he
was
struck
by
the
immutability
of
human
affairs
it
looked
just
the
same
as
on
his
first
visit
to
the
newly
married
darties
years
ago
he
had
chosen
the
furniture
himself
and
so
completely
that
no
subsequent
purchase
had
ever
been
able
to
change
the
room
atmosphere
yes
he
had
founded
his
sister
well
and
she
had
wanted
it
indeed
it
said
a
great
deal
for
winifred
that
after
all
this
time
with
dartie
she
remained
from
the
first
soames
had
nosed
out
dartie
nature
from
underneath
the
plausibility
savoir
faire
and
good
looks
which
had
dazzled
winifred
her
mother
and
even
james
to
the
extent
of
permitting
the
fellow
to
marry
his
daughter
without
bringing
anything
but
shares
of
no
value
into
settlement
winifred
whom
he
noticed
next
to
the
furniture
was
sitting
at
her
buhl
bureau
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
she
rose
and
came
towards
him
tall
as
himself
strong
in
the
cheekbones
well
tailored
something
in
her
face
disturbed
soames
she
crumpled
the
letter
in
her
hand
but
seemed
to
change
her
mind
and
held
it
out
to
him
he
was
her
lawyer
as
well
as
her
brother
soames
read
on
iseeum
club
paper
these
words
will
not
get
chance
to
insult
in
my
own
again
i
am
leaving
country
it
played
out
i
tired
of
being
insulted
by
you
brought
on
yourself
no
man
can
stand
it
i
shall
not
ask
you
for
anything
again
i
took
the
photograph
of
the
two
girls
give
them
my
love
i
do
care
what
your
family
say
it
all
their
doing
i
going
to
live
new
life
this
note
had
a
splotch
on
it
not
yet
quite
dry
he
looked
at
splotch
had
clearly
come
from
her
and
he
checked
the
words
riddance
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
with
this
letter
she
was
entering
that
very
state
which
he
himself
so
earnestly
desired
to
state
of
a
forsyte
who
was
not
divorced
winifred
had
turned
away
and
was
taking
a
long
sniff
from
a
little
bottle
a
dull
commiseration
together
with
a
vague
sense
of
injury
crept
about
soames
heart
he
had
come
to
her
to
talk
of
his
own
position
and
get
sympathy
and
here
was
she
in
the
same
position
wanting
of
course
to
talk
of
it
and
get
sympathy
from
him
it
was
always
like
that
nobody
ever
seemed
to
think
that
he
had
troubles
and
interests
of
his
own
he
folded
up
the
letter
with
the
splotch
inside
and
said
what
it
all
about
now
winifred
recited
the
story
of
the
pearls
calmly
do
you
think
he
really
gone
soames
you
see
the
state
he
was
in
when
he
wrote
soames
who
when
he
desired
a
thing
placated
providence
by
pretending
that
he
did
not
think
it
likely
to
happen
answered
i
should
think
so
i
might
find
out
at
his
if
george
is
there
said
winifred
he
would
george
said
soames
i
saw
him
at
his
father
then
he
sure
to
be
soames
whose
good
sense
applauded
his
sister
acumen
said
grudgingly
well
i
go
round
have
you
said
anything
in
park
lane
i
told
emily
returned
winifred
who
retained
that
way
of
describing
her
mother
father
would
have
a
indeed
anything
untoward
was
now
sedulously
kept
from
james
with
another
look
round
at
the
furniture
as
if
to
gauge
his
sister
exact
position
soames
went
out
towards
piccadilly
the
evening
was
drawing
touch
of
chill
in
the
october
haze
he
walked
quickly
with
his
close
and
concentrated
air
he
must
get
through
for
he
wished
to
dine
in
soho
on
hearing
from
the
hall
porter
at
the
iseeum
that
dartie
had
not
been
in
he
looked
at
the
trusty
fellow
and
decided
only
to
ask
if
george
forsyte
was
in
the
club
he
was
soames
who
always
looked
askance
at
his
cousin
george
as
one
inclined
to
jest
at
his
expense
followed
the
pageboy
slightly
reassured
by
the
thought
that
george
had
just
lost
his
father
he
must
have
come
in
for
about
thirty
thousand
besides
what
he
had
under
that
settlement
of
roger
which
had
avoided
death
duty
he
found
george
in
a
staring
out
across
a
plate
of
muffins
his
tall
bulky
figure
loomed
almost
threatening
though
preserving
still
the
supernatural
neatness
of
the
racing
man
with
a
faint
grin
on
his
fleshy
face
he
said
hallo
soames
have
a
muffin
no
thanks
murmured
soames
and
nursing
his
hat
with
the
desire
to
say
something
suitable
and
sympathetic
added
how
your
mother
thanks
said
george
have
seen
you
for
ages
you
never
go
racing
how
the
city
soames
scenting
the
approach
of
a
jest
closed
up
and
answered
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
dartie
i
hear
he
flitted
made
a
bolt
to
buenos
aires
with
the
fair
lola
good
for
winifred
and
the
little
darties
he
a
soames
nodded
naturally
inimical
as
these
cousins
were
dartie
made
them
kin
uncle
james
sleep
in
his
bed
now
resumed
george
i
suppose
had
a
lot
off
you
soames
smiled
ah
you
saw
him
further
said
george
amicably
he
a
real
rouser
young
val
will
want
a
bit
of
looking
after
i
was
always
sorry
for
winifred
she
a
plucky
again
soames
nodded
i
must
be
getting
back
to
her
he
said
she
just
wanted
to
know
for
certain
we
may
have
to
take
steps
i
suppose
no
mistake
it
quite
said
was
he
who
invented
so
many
of
those
quaint
sayings
which
have
been
assigned
to
other
sources
he
was
drunk
as
a
lord
last
night
but
he
went
off
all
right
this
morning
his
the
tuscarora
and
fishing
out
a
card
he
read
mockingly
montague
dartie
poste
restante
buenos
aires
i
should
hurry
up
with
the
steps
if
i
were
you
he
fairly
fed
me
up
last
yes
said
soames
but
it
not
always
then
conscious
from
george
eyes
that
he
had
roused
reminiscence
of
his
own
affair
he
got
up
and
held
out
his
hand
george
rose
too
remember
me
to
winifred
you
enter
her
for
the
divorce
stakes
straight
off
if
you
ask
soames
took
a
sidelong
look
back
at
him
from
the
doorway
george
had
seated
himself
again
and
was
staring
before
him
he
looked
big
and
lonely
in
those
black
clothes
soames
had
never
known
him
so
subdued
suppose
he
feels
it
in
a
way
he
thought
must
have
about
fifty
thousand
each
all
told
they
ought
to
keep
the
estate
together
if
there
a
war
house
property
will
go
down
uncle
roger
was
a
good
judge
though
and
the
face
of
annette
rose
before
him
in
the
darkening
street
her
brown
hair
and
her
blue
eyes
with
their
dark
lashes
her
fresh
lips
and
cheeks
dewy
and
blooming
in
spite
of
london
her
perfect
french
figure
steps
he
thought
winifred
house
he
encountered
val
and
they
went
in
together
an
idea
had
occurred
to
soames
his
cousin
jolyon
was
irene
trustee
the
first
step
would
be
to
go
down
and
see
him
at
robin
hill
robin
hill
the
very
odd
feeling
those
words
brought
back
robin
house
bosinney
had
built
for
him
and
house
they
had
never
lived
fatal
house
and
jolyon
lived
there
now
h
and
suddenly
he
thought
say
he
got
a
boy
at
oxford
why
not
take
young
val
down
and
introduce
them
it
an
excuse
less
much
less
bald
so
as
they
went
upstairs
he
said
to
val
you
got
a
cousin
at
oxford
you
never
met
him
i
should
like
to
take
you
down
with
me
to
where
he
lives
and
introduce
you
you
find
it
val
receiving
the
idea
with
but
moderate
transports
soames
clinched
it
i
call
for
you
after
lunch
it
in
the
far
enjoy
on
the
threshold
of
the
he
recalled
with
an
effort
that
the
steps
he
contemplated
concerned
winifred
at
the
moment
not
himself
winifred
was
still
sitting
at
her
buhl
bureau
it
quite
true
he
said
he
gone
to
buenos
aires
started
this
better
have
him
shadowed
when
he
lands
i
cable
at
once
otherwise
we
may
have
a
lot
of
expense
the
sooner
these
things
are
done
the
better
i
always
regretting
that
i
did
he
stopped
and
looked
sidelong
at
the
silent
winifred
by
the
way
he
went
on
can
you
prove
cruelty
winifred
said
in
a
dull
voice
i
do
know
what
is
cruelty
well
has
he
struck
you
or
anything
winifred
shook
herself
and
her
jaw
grew
square
he
twisted
my
arm
or
would
pointing
a
pistol
count
or
being
too
drunk
to
undress
himself
ca
bring
in
the
no
said
soames
no
i
wonder
of
course
there
legal
can
get
that
but
separation
um
what
does
it
mean
asked
winifred
desolately
that
he
ca
touch
you
or
you
him
you
both
of
you
married
and
and
again
he
grunted
what
was
it
in
fact
but
his
own
accursed
position
legalised
no
he
would
not
put
her
into
that
it
must
be
divorce
he
said
decisively
failing
cruelty
desertion
there
a
way
of
shortening
the
two
years
now
we
get
the
court
to
give
us
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
then
if
he
obey
we
can
bring
a
suit
for
divorce
in
six
months
time
of
course
you
do
want
him
back
but
they
wo
know
that
still
there
the
risk
that
he
might
come
i
rather
try
winifred
shook
her
head
it
so
well
soames
murmured
perhaps
there
is
much
risk
so
long
as
infatuated
and
got
money
do
say
anything
to
anybody
and
do
pay
any
of
his
winifred
sighed
in
spite
of
all
she
had
been
through
the
sense
of
loss
was
heavy
on
her
and
this
idea
of
not
paying
his
debts
any
more
brought
it
home
to
her
as
nothing
else
yet
had
some
richness
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
life
without
her
husband
without
her
pearls
without
that
intimate
sense
that
she
made
a
brave
show
above
the
domestic
whirlpool
she
would
now
have
to
face
the
world
she
felt
bereaved
indeed
and
into
the
chilly
kiss
he
placed
on
her
forehead
soames
put
more
than
his
usual
warmth
i
have
to
go
down
to
robin
hill
he
said
to
see
young
jolyon
on
business
he
got
a
boy
at
oxford
i
like
to
take
val
with
me
and
introduce
him
come
down
to
shelter
for
the
and
bring
the
children
oh
by
the
way
no
that
wo
do
i
got
some
other
people
so
saying
he
left
her
and
turned
towards
soho
chapter
of
all
quarters
in
the
queer
adventurous
amalgam
called
london
soho
is
perhaps
least
suited
to
the
forsyte
spirit
my
wild
one
george
would
have
said
if
he
had
seen
his
cousin
going
there
untidy
full
of
greeks
ishmaelites
cats
italians
tomatoes
restaurants
organs
coloured
stuffs
queer
names
people
looking
out
of
upper
windows
it
dwells
remote
from
the
british
body
politic
yet
has
it
haphazard
proprietary
instincts
of
its
own
and
a
certain
possessive
prosperity
which
keeps
its
rents
up
when
those
of
other
quarters
go
down
for
long
years
soames
acquaintanceship
with
soho
had
been
confined
to
its
western
bastion
wardour
street
many
bargains
had
he
picked
up
there
even
during
those
seven
years
at
brighton
after
bosinney
death
and
irene
flight
he
had
bought
treasures
there
sometimes
though
he
had
no
place
to
put
them
for
when
the
conviction
that
his
wife
had
gone
for
good
at
last
became
firm
within
him
he
had
caused
a
board
to
be
put
up
in
montpellier
square
for
sale
the
lease
of
this
desirable
residence
enquire
of
messrs
lesson
and
tukes
court
street
belgravia
it
had
sold
within
a
desirable
residence
in
the
shadow
of
whose
perfection
a
man
and
a
woman
had
eaten
their
hearts
out
of
a
misty
january
evening
just
before
the
board
was
taken
down
soames
had
gone
there
once
more
and
stood
against
the
square
railings
looking
at
its
unlighted
windows
chewing
the
cud
of
possessive
memories
which
had
turned
so
bitter
in
the
mouth
why
had
she
never
loved
him
why
she
had
been
given
all
she
had
wanted
and
in
return
had
given
him
for
three
long
years
all
he
had
indeed
her
heart
he
had
uttered
a
little
involuntary
groan
and
a
passing
policeman
had
glanced
suspiciously
at
him
who
no
longer
possessed
the
right
to
enter
that
green
door
with
the
carved
brass
knocker
beneath
the
board
sale
a
choking
sensation
had
attacked
his
throat
and
he
had
hurried
away
into
the
mist
that
evening
he
had
gone
to
brighton
to
live
approaching
malta
street
soho
and
the
restaurant
bretagne
where
annette
would
be
drooping
her
pretty
shoulders
over
her
accounts
soames
thought
with
wonder
of
those
seven
years
at
brighton
how
had
he
managed
to
go
on
so
long
in
that
town
devoid
of
the
scent
of
sweetpeas
where
he
had
not
even
space
to
put
his
treasures
true
those
had
been
years
with
no
time
at
all
for
looking
at
of
almost
passionate
during
which
forsyte
bustard
and
forsyte
had
become
solicitors
to
more
limited
companies
than
they
could
properly
attend
to
up
to
the
city
of
a
morning
in
a
pullman
car
down
from
the
city
of
an
evening
in
a
pullman
car
law
papers
again
after
dinner
then
the
sleep
of
the
tired
and
up
again
next
morning
saturday
to
monday
was
spent
at
his
club
in
reversal
of
customary
procedure
based
on
the
deep
and
careful
instinct
that
while
working
so
hard
he
needed
sea
air
to
and
from
the
station
twice
a
day
and
while
resting
must
indulge
his
domestic
affections
the
sunday
visit
to
his
family
in
park
lane
to
timothy
and
to
green
street
the
occasional
visits
elsewhere
had
seemed
to
him
as
necessary
to
health
as
sea
air
on
weekdays
even
since
his
migration
to
mapledurham
he
had
maintained
those
habits
had
known
annette
whether
annette
had
produced
the
revolution
in
his
outlook
or
that
outlook
had
produced
annette
he
knew
no
more
than
we
know
where
a
circle
begins
it
was
intricate
and
deeply
involved
with
the
growing
consciousness
that
property
without
anyone
to
leave
it
to
is
the
negation
of
true
forsyteism
to
have
an
heir
some
continuance
of
self
who
would
begin
where
he
left
in
fact
that
he
would
not
leave
quite
obsessed
him
for
the
last
year
and
more
after
buying
a
bit
of
wedgwood
one
evening
in
april
he
had
dropped
into
malta
street
to
look
at
a
house
of
his
father
which
had
been
turned
into
a
risky
proceeding
and
one
not
quite
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
lease
he
had
stared
for
a
little
at
the
outside
painted
a
good
cream
colour
with
two
tubs
containing
little
in
a
recessed
at
the
words
above
them
in
gold
letters
rather
favourably
impressed
entering
he
had
noticed
that
several
people
were
already
seated
at
little
round
green
tables
with
little
pots
of
fresh
flowers
on
them
and
plates
and
had
asked
of
a
trim
waitress
to
see
the
proprietor
they
had
shown
him
into
a
back
room
where
a
girl
was
sitting
at
a
simple
bureau
covered
with
papers
and
a
small
round
table
was
laid
for
two
the
impression
of
cleanliness
order
and
good
taste
was
confirmed
when
the
girl
got
up
saying
you
wish
to
see
maman
monsieur
in
a
broken
accent
yes
soames
had
answered
i
represent
your
landlord
in
fact
i
his
wo
you
sit
down
sir
please
tell
maman
to
come
to
this
he
was
pleased
that
the
girl
seemed
impressed
because
it
showed
business
instinct
and
suddenly
he
noticed
that
she
was
remarkably
remarkably
pretty
that
his
eyes
found
a
difficulty
in
leaving
her
face
when
she
moved
to
put
a
chair
for
him
she
swayed
in
a
curious
subtle
way
as
if
she
had
been
put
together
by
someone
with
a
special
secret
skill
and
her
face
and
neck
which
was
a
little
bared
looked
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
been
sprayed
with
dew
probably
at
this
moment
soames
decided
that
the
lease
had
not
been
violated
though
to
himself
and
his
father
he
based
the
decision
on
the
efficiency
of
those
illicit
adaptations
in
the
building
on
the
signs
of
prosperity
and
the
obvious
business
capacity
of
madame
lamotte
he
did
not
however
neglect
to
leave
certain
matters
to
future
consideration
which
had
necessitated
further
visits
so
that
the
little
back
room
had
become
quite
accustomed
to
his
spare
not
unsolid
but
unobtrusive
figure
and
his
pale
chinny
face
with
clipped
moustache
and
dark
hair
not
yet
grizzling
at
the
sides
un
monsieur
tres
distingue
madame
lamotte
found
him
and
presently
tres
amical
tres
gentil
watching
his
eyes
upon
her
daughter
she
was
one
of
those
generously
built
frenchwomen
whose
every
action
and
tone
of
voice
inspire
perfect
confidence
in
the
thoroughness
of
their
domestic
tastes
their
knowledge
of
cooking
and
the
careful
increase
of
their
bank
balances
after
those
visits
to
the
restaurant
bretagne
began
other
visits
indeed
any
definite
decision
for
soames
like
all
forsytes
and
the
great
majority
of
their
countrymen
was
a
born
empiricist
but
it
was
this
change
in
his
mode
of
life
which
had
gradually
made
him
so
definitely
conscious
that
he
desired
to
alter
his
condition
from
that
of
the
unmarried
married
man
to
that
of
the
married
man
remarried
turning
into
malta
street
on
this
evening
of
early
october
he
bought
a
paper
to
see
if
there
were
any
of
the
dreyfus
question
which
he
had
always
found
useful
in
making
closer
acquaintanceship
with
madame
lamotte
and
her
daughter
who
were
catholic
and
scanning
those
columns
soames
found
nothing
french
but
noticed
a
general
fall
on
the
stock
exchange
and
an
ominous
leader
about
the
transvaal
he
entered
thinking
a
certainty
i
shall
sell
my
consols
not
that
he
had
many
personally
the
rate
of
interest
was
too
wretched
but
he
should
advise
his
would
assuredly
go
down
a
look
as
he
passed
the
doorways
of
the
restaurant
assured
him
that
business
was
good
as
ever
and
this
which
in
april
would
have
pleased
him
now
gave
him
a
certain
uneasiness
if
the
steps
which
he
had
to
take
ended
in
his
marrying
annette
he
would
rather
see
her
mother
safely
back
in
france
a
move
to
which
the
prosperity
of
the
restaurant
bretagne
might
become
an
obstacle
he
would
have
to
buy
them
out
of
course
for
french
people
only
came
to
england
to
make
money
and
it
would
mean
a
higher
price
and
then
that
peculiar
sweet
sensation
at
the
back
of
his
throat
and
a
slight
thumping
about
the
heart
which
he
always
experienced
at
the
door
of
the
little
room
prevented
his
thinking
how
much
it
would
cost
going
in
he
was
conscious
of
an
abundant
black
skirt
vanishing
through
the
door
into
the
restaurant
and
of
annette
with
her
hands
up
to
her
hair
it
was
the
attitude
in
which
of
all
others
he
admired
beautifully
straight
and
rounded
and
supple
and
he
said
i
just
came
in
to
talk
to
your
mother
about
pulling
down
that
partition
no
do
call
monsieur
will
have
supper
with
us
it
will
be
ready
in
ten
soames
who
still
held
her
hand
was
overcome
by
an
impulse
which
surprised
him
you
look
so
pretty
he
said
so
very
pretty
do
you
know
how
pretty
you
look
annette
annette
withdrew
her
hand
and
blushed
monsieur
is
very
not
a
bit
good
said
soames
and
sat
down
gloomily
annette
made
a
little
expressive
gesture
with
her
hands
a
smile
was
crinkling
her
red
lips
untouched
by
salve
and
looking
at
those
lips
soames
said
are
you
happy
over
here
or
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
france
oh
i
like
london
paris
of
course
but
london
is
better
than
orleans
and
the
english
country
is
so
beautiful
i
have
been
to
richmond
last
soames
went
through
a
moment
of
calculating
struggle
mapledurham
dared
he
after
all
dared
he
go
so
far
as
that
and
show
her
what
there
was
to
look
forward
to
still
down
there
one
could
say
things
in
this
room
it
was
impossible
i
want
you
and
your
mother
he
said
suddenly
to
come
for
the
afternoon
next
sunday
my
house
is
on
the
river
it
not
too
late
in
this
weather
and
i
can
show
you
some
good
pictures
what
do
you
say
annette
clasped
her
hands
it
will
be
lovelee
the
river
is
so
beautiful
that
understood
then
i
ask
he
need
say
no
more
to
her
this
evening
and
risk
giving
himself
away
but
had
he
not
already
said
too
much
did
one
ask
restaurant
proprietors
with
pretty
daughters
down
to
one
country
house
without
design
madame
lamotte
would
see
if
annette
did
well
there
was
not
much
that
madame
did
not
see
besides
this
was
the
second
time
he
had
stayed
to
supper
with
them
he
owed
them
hospitality
walking
home
towards
park
he
was
staying
at
his
the
impression
of
annette
soft
clever
hand
within
his
own
his
thoughts
were
pleasant
slightly
sensual
rather
puzzled
take
steps
what
steps
how
dirty
linen
washed
in
public
pah
with
his
reputation
for
sagacity
for
and
the
clever
extrication
of
others
he
who
stood
for
proprietary
interests
to
become
the
plaything
of
that
law
of
which
he
was
a
pillar
there
was
something
revolting
in
the
thought
winifred
affair
was
bad
enough
to
have
a
double
dose
of
publicity
in
the
family
would
not
a
liaison
be
better
than
liaison
and
a
son
he
could
adopt
but
dark
solid
watchful
madame
lamotte
blocked
the
avenue
of
that
vision
no
that
would
not
work
it
was
not
as
if
annette
could
have
a
real
passion
for
him
one
could
not
expect
that
at
his
age
if
her
mother
wished
if
the
worldly
advantage
were
manifestly
if
not
refusal
would
be
certain
besides
he
thought
not
a
villain
i
do
want
to
hurt
her
and
i
do
want
anything
underhand
but
i
do
want
her
and
i
want
a
son
there
nothing
for
it
but
under
the
shadow
of
the
in
the
lamplight
he
passed
slowly
along
the
railings
of
the
green
park
mist
clung
there
among
the
bluish
tree
shapes
beyond
range
of
the
lamps
how
many
hundred
times
he
had
walked
past
those
trees
from
his
father
house
in
park
lane
when
he
was
quite
a
young
man
or
from
his
own
house
in
montpellier
square
in
those
four
years
of
married
life
and
making
up
his
mind
to
free
himself
if
he
could
of
that
long
useless
marriage
tie
he
took
a
fancy
to
walk
on
in
at
hyde
park
corner
out
at
knightsbridge
gate
just
as
he
used
to
when
going
home
to
irene
in
the
old
days
what
could
she
be
like
now
had
she
passed
the
years
since
he
last
saw
her
twelve
years
in
all
seven
already
since
uncle
jolyon
left
her
that
money
was
she
still
beautiful
would
he
know
her
if
he
saw
her
not
changed
much
he
thought
expect
she
has
she
made
me
suffer
he
remembered
suddenly
one
night
the
first
on
which
he
went
out
to
dinner
old
malburian
first
year
of
their
marriage
with
what
eagerness
he
had
hurried
back
and
entering
softly
as
a
cat
had
heard
her
playing
opening
the
door
noiselessly
he
had
stood
watching
the
expression
on
her
face
different
from
any
he
knew
so
much
more
open
so
confiding
as
though
to
her
music
she
was
giving
a
heart
he
had
never
seen
and
he
remembered
how
she
stopped
and
looked
round
how
her
face
changed
back
to
that
which
he
did
know
and
what
an
icy
shiver
had
gone
through
him
for
all
that
the
next
moment
he
was
fondling
her
shoulders
yes
she
had
made
him
suffer
divorce
it
seemed
ridiculous
after
all
these
years
of
utter
separation
but
it
would
have
to
be
no
other
way
question
he
thought
with
sudden
realism
of
us
she
or
me
she
deserted
me
she
ought
to
pay
for
it
there
be
someone
i
suppose
involuntarily
he
uttered
a
little
snarling
sound
and
turning
made
his
way

he
would
go

still
in

which

i

was
sitting
before
the
fire
in
a
big
armchair
with
a
shawl
very
light
and
warm
over
his
shoulders
on
to
which
his
long
white
whiskers
drooped
his
white
hair
still
fairly
thick
glistened
in
the
lamplight
a
little
moisture
from
his
fixed
eyes
stained
the
cheeks
still
quite
well
coloured
and
the
long
deep
furrows
running
to
the
corners
of
the
lips
which
moved
as
if
mumbling
thoughts
his
long
legs
thin
as
a
crow
in
plaid
trousers
were
bent
at
less
than
a
right
angle
and
on
one
knee
a
spindly
hand
moved
continually
with
fingers
wide
apart
and
glistening
tapered
nails
beside
him
on
a
low
stool
stood
a
glass
of
negus
bedewed
with
beads
of
heat
there
he
had
been
sitting
with
intervals
for
meals
all
day
at
he
was
still
organically
sound
but
suffering
terribly
from
the
thought
that
no
one
ever
told
him
anything
it
is
indeed
doubtful
how
he
had
become
aware
that
roger
was
being
buried
that
day
for
emily
had
kept
it
from
him
she
was
always
keeping
things
from
him
emily
was
only
seventy
james
had
a
grudge
against
his
wife
youth
he
felt
sometimes
that
he
would
never
have
married
her
if
he
had
known
that
she
would
have
so
many
years
before
her
when
he
had
so
few
it
was
not
natural
she
would
live
fifteen
or
twenty
years
after
he
was
gone
and
might
spend
a
lot
of
money
she
had
always
had
extravagant
tastes
for
all
he
knew
she
might
want
to
buy
one
of
these
cicely
and
rachel
and
imogen
and
all
the
young
all
rode
those
bicycles
now
and
went
off
goodness
knew
where
and
now
roger
was
gone
he
did
tell
the
family
was
breaking
up
soames
would
know
how
much
his
uncle
had
left
curiously
he
thought
of
roger
as
soames
uncle
not
as
his
own
brother
soames
it
was
more
and
more
the
one
solid
spot
in
a
vanishing
world
soames
was
careful
he
was
a
warm
man
but
he
had
no
one
to
leave
his
money
to
there
it
was
he
did
know
and
there
was
that
fellow
chamberlain
for
james
political
principles
had
been
fixed
between
and
when
rascally
radical
had
been
the
chief
thorn
in
the
side
of
property
and
he
distrusted
him
to
this
day
in
spite
of
his
conversion
he
would
get
the
country
into
a
mess
and
make
money
go
down
before
he
had
done
with
it
a
stormy
petrel
of
a
chap
where
was
soames
he
had
gone
to
the
funeral
of
course
which
they
had
tried
to
keep
from
him
he
knew
that
perfectly
well
he
had
seen
his
son
trousers
roger
roger
in
his
coffin
he
remembered
how
when
they
came
up
from
school
together
from
the
west
on
the
box
seat
of
the
old
slowflyer
in
roger
had
got
into
the
and
gone
to
sleep
james
uttered
a
thin
cackle
a
funny
original
he
did
know
younger
than
himself
and
in
his
coffin
the
family
was
breaking
up
there
was
val
going
to
the
university
he
never
came
to
see
him
now
he
would
cost
a
pretty
penny
up
there
it
was
an
extravagant
age
and
all
the
pretty
pennies
that
his
four
grandchildren
would
cost
him
danced
before
eyes
he
did
not
grudge
them
the
money
but
he
grudged
terribly
the
risk
which
the
spending
of
that
money
might
bring
on
them
he
grudged
the
diminution
of
security
and
now
that
cicely
had
married
she
might
be
having
children
too
he
did
tell
nobody
thought
of
anything
but
spending
money
in
these
days
and
racing
about
and
having
what
they
called
good
time
a
went
past
the
window
ugly
great
lumbering
thing
making
all
that
racket
but
there
it
was
the
country
rattling
to
the
dogs
people
in
such
a
hurry
that
they
even
care
for
neat
turnout
like
his
barouche
and
bays
was
worth
all
those
things
and
consols
at
there
must
be
a
lot
of
money
in
the
country
and
now
there
was
this
old
kruger
they
had
tried
to
keep
old
kruger
from
him
but
he
knew
better
there
would
be
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
out
there
he
had
known
how
it
would
be
when
that
fellow
now
thank
god
made
such
a
mess
of
it
after
that
dreadful
business
at
majuba
he
should
wonder
if
the
empire
split
up
and
went
to
pot
and
this
vision
of
the
empire
going
to
pot
filled
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
with
qualms
of
the
most
serious
character
he
had
eaten
a
poor
lunch
because
of
them
but
it
was
after
lunch
that
the
real
disaster
to
his
nerves
occurred
he
had
been
dozing
when
he
became
aware
of
voices
ah
they
never
told
him
anything
and
her
mother
monty
that
fellow
that
fellow
dartie
the
voices
had
receded
and
james
had
been
left
alone
with
his
ears
standing
up
like
a
hare
and
fear
creeping
about
his
inwards
why
did
they
leave
him
alone
why
did
they
come
and
tell
him
and
an
awful
thought
which
through
long
years
had
haunted
him
concreted
again
swiftly
in
his
brain
dartie
had
gone
bankrupt
and
to
save
winifred
and
the
children
have
to
pay
could
soames
turn
him
into
a
limited
company
no
he
could
there
it
was
with
every
minute
before
emily
came
back
the
spectre
fiercened
why
it
might
be
forgery
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
doubted
turner
in
the
centre
of
the
wall
james
suffered
tortures
he
saw
dartie
in
the
dock
his
grandchildren
in
the
gutter
and
himself
in
bed
he
saw
the
doubted
turner
being
sold
at
jobson
and
all
the
majestic
edifice
of
property
in
rags
he
saw
in
fancy
winifred
unfashionably
dressed
and
heard
in
fancy
emily
voice
saying
now
do
fuss
james
she
was
always
saying
do
fuss
she
had
no
nerves
he
ought
never
to
have
married
a
woman
eighteen
years
younger
than
himself
then
emily
real
voice
said
have
you
had
a
nice
nap
james
nap
he
was
in
torment
and
she
asked
him
that
what
this
about
dartie
he
said
and
his
eyes
glared
at
her
emily
never
deserted
her
what
have
you
been
hearing
she
asked
blandly
what
this
about
dartie
repeated
james
he
gone
fiddle
james
made
a
great
effort
and
rose
to
the
full
height
of
his
figure
you
never
tell
me
anything
he
said
he
gone
the
destruction
of
that
fixed
idea
seemed
to
emily
all
that
mattered
at
the
moment
he
has
not
she
answered
firmly
he
gone
to
buenos
if
she
had
said
he
gone
to
mars
she
could
not
have
dealt
james
a
more
stunning
blow
his
imagination
invested
entirely
in
british
securities
could
as
little
grasp
one
place
as
the
other
what
he
gone
there
for
he
said
he
got
no
money
what
did
he
take
agitated
within
by
winifred
news
and
goaded
by
the
constant
reiteration
of
this
jeremiad
emily
said
calmly
he
took
winifred
pearls
and
a
what
said
james
and
sat
down
his
sudden
collapse
alarmed
her
and
smoothing
his
forehead
she
said
now
do
fuss
james
a
dusky
red
had
spread
over
james
cheeks
and
forehead
i
paid
for
them
he
said
tremblingly
he
a
thief
knew
how
it
would
be
he
be
the
death
of
me
he
words
failed
him
and
he
sat
quite
still
emily
who
thought
she
knew
him
so
well
was
alarmed
and
went
towards
the
sideboard
where
she
kept
some
sal
volatile
she
could
not
see
the
tenacious
forsyte
spirit
working
in
that
thin
tremulous
shape
against
the
extravagance
of
the
emotion
called
up
by
this
outrage
on
forsyte
forsyte
spirit
deep
in
there
saying
must
get
into
a
fantod
it
never
do
you
wo
digest
your
lunch
you
have
a
fit
all
unseen
by
her
it
was
doing
better
work
in
james
than
sal
volatile
drink
this
she
said
james
waved
it
aside
what
was
winifred
about
he
said
to
let
him
take
her
pearls
emily
perceived
the
crisis
past
she
can
have
mine
she
said
comfortably
i
never
wear
them
better
get
a
there
you
go
said
james
divorce
we
never
had
a
divorce
in
the
family
where
soames
he

in
no
he
wo
said
james
almost
fiercely
he
at
the
funeral
you
think
i
know
well
said
emily
with
calm
you
should
get
into
such
fusses
when
we
tell
you
and
plumping
up
his
cushions
and
putting
the
sal
volatile
beside
him
she
left
the
room
but
james
sat
there
seeing
winifred
in
the
divorce
court
and
the
family
name
in
the
papers
of
the
earth
falling
on
roger
coffin
of
val
taking
after
his
father
of
the
pearls
he
had
paid
for
and
would
never
see
again
of
money
back
at
four
per
and
the
country
going
to
the
dogs
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
into
evening
and
passed
and
dinnertime
those
visions
became
more
and
more
mixed
and
being
told
nothing
till
he
had
nothing
left
of
all
his
wealth
and
they
told
him
nothing
of
it
where
was
soames
why
did
he
come
in
his
hand
grasped
the
glass
of
negus
he
raised
it
to
drink
and
saw
his
son
standing
there
looking
at
him
a
little
sigh
of
relief
escaped
his
lips
and
putting
the
glass
down
he
said
there
you
are
dartie
gone
to
buenos
soames
nodded
that
all
right
he
said
good
a
wave
of
assuagement
passed
over
james
brain
soames
knew
soames
was
the
only
one
of
them
all
who
had
sense
why
could
he
come
and
live
at
home
he
had
no
son
of
his
own
and
he
said
plaintively
at
my
age
i
get
nervous
i
wish
you
were
more
at
home
my
again
soames
nodded
the
mask
of
his
countenance
betrayed
no
understanding
but
he
went
closer
and
as
if
by
accident
touched
his
father
shoulder
they
sent
their
love
to
you
at
timothy
he
said
it
went
off
all
right
i
been
to
see
winifred
i
going
to
take
and
he
thought
and
you
must
hear
of
them
james
looked
up
his
long
white
whiskers
quivered
his
thin
throat
between
the
points
of
his
collar
looked
very
gristly
and
naked
i
been
very
poorly
all
day
he
said
they
never
tell
me
soames
heart
twitched
well
it
all
right
there
nothing
to
worry
about
will
you
come
up
now
and
he
put
his
hand
under
his
father
arm
james
obediently
and
tremulously
raised
himself
and
together
they
went
slowly
across
the
room
which
had
a
rich
look
in
the
firelight
and
out
to
the
stairs
very
slowly
they
ascended
my
boy
said
james
at
his
bedroom
door
father
answered
soames
his
hand
stroked
down
the
sleeve
beneath
the
shawl
it
seemed
to
have
almost
nothing
in
it
so
thin
was
the
arm
and
turning
away
from
the
light
in
the
opening
doorway
he
went
up
the
extra
flight
to
his
own
bedroom

a
son

on

jolyon
at

trees
take
little
account
of
time
and
the
old
oak
on
the
upper
lawn
at
robin
hill
looked
no
day
older
than
when
bosinney
sprawled
under
it
and
said
to
soames
forsyte
i
found
the
very
place
for
your
since
then
swithin
had
dreamed
and
old
jolyon
died
beneath
its
branches
and
now
close
to
the
swing
jolyon
often
painted
there
of
all
spots
in
the
world
it
was
perhaps
the
most
sacred
to
him
for
he
had
loved
his
father
contemplating
its
great
and
a
little
mossed
but
not
yet
would
speculate
on
the
passage
of
time
that
tree
had
seen
perhaps
all
real
english
history
it
dated
he
should
wonder
from
the
days
of
elizabeth
at
least
his
own
fifty
years
were
as
nothing
to
its
wood
when
the
house
behind
it
which
he
now
owned
was
three
hundred
years
of
age
instead
of
twelve
that
tree
might
still
be
standing
there
vast
and
who
would
commit
such
sacrilege
as
to
cut
it
down
a
forsyte
might
perhaps
still
be
living
in
that
house
to
guard
it
jealously
and
jolyon
would
wonder
what
the
house
would
look
like
coated
with
such
age
wistaria
was
already
about
its
new
look
had
gone
would
it
hold
its
own
and
keep
the
dignity
bosinney
had
bestowed
on
it
or
would
the
giant
london
have
lapped
it
round
and
made
it
into
an
asylum
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
often
within
and
without
of
it
he
was
persuaded
that
bosinney
had
been
moved
by
the
spirit
when
he
built
he
had
put
his
heart
into
that
house
indeed
it
might
even
become
one
of
the
of
rare
achievement
for
a
house
in
these
degenerate
days
of
building
and
the
aesthetic
spirit
moving
hand
in
hand
with
his
forsyte
sense
of
possessive
continuity
dwelt
with
pride
and
pleasure
on
his
ownership
thereof
there
was
the
smack
of
reverence
and
if
only
for
one
ancestor
in
his
desire
to
hand
this
house
down
to
his
son
and
his
son
son
his
father
had
loved
the
house
had
loved
the
view
the
grounds
that
tree
his
last
years
had
been
happy
there
and
no
one
had
lived
there
before
him
these
last
eleven
years
at
robin
hill
had
formed
in
jolyon
life
as
a
painter
the
important
period
of
success
he
was
now
in
the
very
van
of
art
hanging
on
the
line
everywhere
his
drawings
fetched
high
prices
specialising
in
that
one
medium
with
the
tenacity
of
his
breed
he
had
late
but
not
too
late
for
a
member
of
the
family
which
made
a
point
of
living
for
ever
his
art
had
really
deepened
and
improved
in
conformity
with
his
position
he
had
grown
a
short
fair
beard
which
was
just
beginning
to
grizzle
and
hid

his

face
had
lost

expression
of

ostracised
looked

of

of

domestic
tragedies

jealous
of
her
june
jealous
even
of
her
own
little
daughter
holly
and
making
ceaseless
plaint
that
he
could
not
love
her
ill
as
she
was
and
to
everyone
and
better
dead
he
had
mourned
her
sincerely
but
his
face
had
looked
younger
since
she
died
if
she
could
only
have
believed
that
she
made
him
happy
how
much
happier
would
the
twenty
years
of
their
companionship
have
been
june
had
never
really
got
on
well
with
her
who
had
reprehensibly
taken
her
own
mother
place
and
ever
since
old
jolyon
died
she
had
been
established
in
a
sort
of
studio
in
london
but
she
had
come
back
to
robin
hill
on
her
stepmother
death
and
gathered
the
reins
there
into
her
small
decided
hands
jolly
was
then
at
harrow
holly
still
learning
from
mademoiselle
beauce
there
had
been
nothing
to
keep
jolyon
at
home
and
he
had
removed
his
grief
and
his
abroad
there
he
had
wandered
for
the
most
part
in
brittany
and
at
last
had
fetched
up
in
paris
he
had
stayed
there
several
months
and
come
back
with
the
younger
face
and
the
short
fair
beard
essentially
a
man
who
merely
lodged
in
any
house
it
had
suited
him
perfectly
that
june
should
reign
at
robin
hill
so
that
he
was
free
to
go
off
with
his
easel
where
and
when
he
liked
she
was
inclined
it
is
true
to
regard
the
house
rather
as
an
asylum
for
her
proteges
but
his
own
outcast
days
had
filled
jolyon
for
ever
with
sympathy
towards
an
outcast
and
june
ducks
about
the
place
did
not
annoy
him
by
all
means
let
her
have
them
feed
them
up
and
though
his
slightly
cynical
humour
perceived
that
they
ministered
to
his
daughter
love
of
domination
as
well
as
moved
her
warm
heart
he
never
ceased
to
admire
her
for
having
so
many
ducks
he
fell
indeed
year
by
year
into
a
more
and
more
detached
and
brotherly
attitude
towards
his
own
son
and
daughters
treating
them
with
a
sort
of
whimsical
equality
when
he
went
down
to
harrow
to
see
jolly
he
never
quite
knew
which
of
them
was
the
elder
and
would
sit
eating
cherries
with
him
out
of
one
paper
bag
with
an
affectionate
and
ironical
smile
twisting
up
an
eyebrow
and
curling
his
lips
a
little
and
he
was
always
careful
to
have
money
in
his
pocket
and
to
be
modish
in
his
dress
so
that
his
son
need
not
blush
for
him
they
were
perfect
friends
but
never
seemed
to
have
occasion
for
verbal
confidences
both
having
the
competitive
of
forsytes
they
knew
they
would
stand
by
each
other
in
scrapes
but
there
was
no
need
to
talk
about
it
jolyon
had
a
striking
original
sin
but
partly
the
result
of
his
early
the
moral
attitude
the
most
he
could
ever
have
said
to
his
son
would
have
been
look
here
old
man
do
forget
you
a
gentleman
and
then
have
wondered
whimsically
whether
that
was
not
a
snobbish
sentiment
the
great
cricket
match
was
perhaps
the
most
searching
and
awkward
time
they
annually
went
through
together
for
jolyon
had
been
at
eton
they
would
be
particularly
careful
during
that
match
continually
saying
hooray
oh
hard
luck
old
man
or
hooray
oh
bad
luck
dad
to
each
other
when
some
disaster
at
which
their
hearts
bounded
happened
to
the
opposing
school
and
jolyon
would
wear
a
grey
top
hat
instead
of
his
usual
soft
one
to
save
his
son
feelings
for
a
black
top
hat
he
could
not
stomach
when
jolly
went
up
to
oxford
jolyon
went
up
with
him
amused
humble
and
a
little
anxious
not
to
discredit
his
boy
amongst
all
these
youths
who
seemed
so
much
more
assured
and
old
than
himself
he
often
thought
i
a
painter
for
he
had
long
dropped
at
so
innocuous
you
ca
look
down
on
a
ca
take
him
seriously
enough
for
jolly
who
had
a
sort
of
natural
lordliness
had
passed
at
once
into
a
very
small
set
who
secretly
amused
his
father
the
boy
had
fair
hair
which
curled
a
little
and
his
grandfather
deepset
eyes
he
was
and
very
upright
and
always
pleased
jolyon
aesthetic
sense
so
that
he
was
a
tiny
bit
afraid
of
him
as
artists
ever
are
of
those
of
their
own
sex
whom
they
admire
physically
on
that
occasion
however
he
actually
did
screw
up
his
courage
to
give
his
son
advice
and
this
was
it
look
here
old
man
you
bound
to
get
into
debt
mind
you
come
to
me
at
once
of
course
i
always
pay
them
but
you
might
remember
that
one
respects
oneself
more
afterwards
if
one
pays
one
own
way
and
do
ever
borrow
except
from
me
will
you
and
jolly
had
said
all
right
dad
i
wo
and
he
never
had
and
there
just
one
other
thing
i
do
know
much
about
morality
and
that
but
there
is
this
it
always
worth
while
before
you
do
anything
to
consider
whether
it
going
to
hurt
another
person
more
than
is
absolutely
jolly
had
looked
thoughtful
and
nodded
and
presently
had
squeezed
his
father
hand
and
jolyon
had
thought
wonder
if
i
had
the
right
to
say
that
he
always
had
a
sort
of
dread
of
losing
the
dumb
confidence
they
had
in
each
other
remembering
how
for
long
years
he
had
lost
his
own
father
so
that
there
had
been
nothing
between
them
but
love
at
a
great
distance
he
no
doubt
the
change
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
since
he
himself
went
up
to
cambridge
in
and
perhaps
he
underestimated
too
his
boy
power
of
understanding
that
he
was
tolerant
to
the
very
bone
it
was
that
tolerance
of
his
and
possibly
his
scepticism
which
ever
made
his
relations
towards
june
so
queerly
defensive
she
was
such
a
decided
mortal
knew
her
own
mind
so
terribly
well
wanted
things
so
inexorably
until
she
got
then
indeed
often
dropped
them
like
a
hot
potato
her
mother
had
been
like
that
whence
had
come
all
those
tears
not
that
his
incompatibility
with
his
daughter
was
anything
like
what
it
had
been
with
the
first
young
jolyon
one
could
be
amused
where
a
daughter
was
concerned
in
a
case
one
could
not
be
amused
to
see
june
set
her
heart
and
jaw
on
a
thing
until
she
got
it
was
all
right
because
it
was
never
anything
which
interfered
fundamentally
with
jolyon
one
thing
on
which
his
jaw
was
also
absolutely
rigid
a
considerable
jaw
under
that
short
grizzling
beard
nor
was
there
ever
any
necessity
for
real
encounters
one
could
break
away
into
indeed
he
often
had
to
but
the
real
trouble
with
june
was
that
she
had
never
appealed
to
his
aesthetic
sense
though
she
might
well
have
with
her
hair
and
her
eyes
and
that
touch
of
the
berserker
in
her
spirit
it
was
very
different
with
holly
soft
and
quiet
shy
and
affectionate
with
a
playful
imp
in
her
somewhere
he
watched
this
younger
daughter
of
his
through
the
duckling
stage
with
extraordinary
interest
would
she
come
out
a
swan
with
her
sallow
oval
face
and
her
grey
wistful
eyes
and
those
long
dark
lashes
she
might
or
she
might
not
only
this
last
year
had
he
been
able
to
guess
yes
she
would
be
a
a
dark
one
always
a
shy
one
but
an
authentic
swan
she
was
eighteen
now
and
mademoiselle
beauce
was
excellent
lady
had
removed
after
eleven
years
haunted
by
her
continuous
reminiscences
of
the
little
tayleurs
to
another
family
whose
bosom
would
now
be
agitated
by
her
reminiscences
of
the
little
forsytes
she
had
taught
holly
to
speak
french
like
herself
portraiture
was
not
jolyon
forte
but
he
had
already
drawn
his
younger
daughter
three
times
and
was
drawing
her
a
fourth
on
the
afternoon
of
october
when
a
card
was
brought
to
him
which
caused
his
eyebrows
to
go
up
soames
forsyte
the
shelter
connoisseurs
club
mapledurham
james
but
here
the
forsyte
saga
must
digress
again
to
return
from
a
long
travel
in
spain
to
a
darkened
house
to
a
little
daughter
bewildered
with
tears
to
the
sight
of
a
loved
father
lying
peaceful
in
his
last
sleep
had
never
been
was
never
likely
to
be
forgotten
by
so
impressionable
and
a
man
as
jolyon
a
sense
as
of
mystery
too
clung
to
that
sad
day
and
about
the
end
of
one
whose
life
had
been
so
balanced
and
it
seemed
incredible
that
his
father
could
thus
have
vanished
without
as
it
were
announcing
his
intention
without
last
words
to
his
son
and
due
farewells
and
those
incoherent
allusions
of
little
holly
to
lady
in
grey
of
mademoiselle
beauce
to
a
madame
errant
as
it
sounded
involved
all
things
in
a
mist
lifted
a
little
when
he
read
his
will
and
the
codicil
thereto
it
had
been
his
duty
as
executor
of
that
will
and
codicil
to
inform
irene
wife
of
his
cousin
soames
of
her
life
interest
in
fifteen
thousand
pounds
he
had
called
on
her
to
explain
that
the
existing
investment
in
india
stock
to
meet
the
charge
would
produce
for
her
the
interesting
net
sum
of
odd
a
year
clear
of
income
tax
this
was
but
the
third
time
he
had
seen
his
cousin
soames
indeed
she
was
still
his
wife
of
which
he
was
not
quite
sure
he
remembered
having
seen
her
sitting
in
the
botanical
gardens
waiting
for
passive
fascinating
figure
reminding
him
of
titian
love
and
again
when
charged
by
his
father
he
had
gone
to
montpellier
square
on
the
afternoon
when
death
was
known
he
still
recalled
vividly
her
sudden
appearance
in
the
doorway
on
that
beautiful
face
passing
from
wild
eagerness
of
hope
to
stony
despair
remembered
the
compassion
he
had
felt
soames
snarling
smile
his
words
we
are
not
at
home
and
the
slam
of
the
front
door
this
third
time
he
saw
a
face
and
form
more
from
that
warp
of
wild
hope
and
despair
looking
at
her
he
thought
you
are
just
what
the
dad
would
have
admired
and
the
strange
story
of
his
father
indian
summer
became
slowly
clear
to
him
she
spoke
of
old
jolyon
with
reverence
and
tears
in
her
eyes
he
was
so
wonderfully
kind
to
me
i
do
know
why
he
looked
so
beautiful
and
peaceful
sitting
in
that
chair
under
the
tree
it
was
i
who
first
came
on
him
sitting
there
you
know
such
a
lovely
day
i
do
think
an
end
could
have
been
happier
we
should
all
like
to
go
out
like
right
he
had
thought
should
all
a
like
to
go
out
in
full
summer
with
beauty
stepping
towards
us
across
a
lawn
and
looking
round
the
little
almost
empty
he
had
asked
her
what
she
was
going
to
do
now
i
am
going
to
live
again
a
little
cousin
jolyon
wonderful
to
have
money
of
one
own
i
never
had
any
i
shall
keep
this
flat
i
think
i
used
to
it
but
i
shall
be
able
to
go
to
exactly
jolyon
had
murmured
looking
at
her
faintly
smiling
lips
and
he
had
gone
away
thinking
fascinating
woman
what
a
waste
glad
the
dad
left
her
that
money
he
had
not
seen
her
again
but
every
quarter
he
had
signed
her
cheque
forwarding
it
to
her
bank
with
a
note
to
the
chelsea
flat
to
say
that
he
had
done
so
and
always
he
had
received
a
note
in
acknowledgment
generally
from
the
flat
but
sometimes
from
italy
so
that
her
personality
had
become
embodied
in
slightly
scented
grey
paper
an
upright
fine
handwriting
and
the
words
cousin
jolyon
man
of
property
that
he
now
was
the
slender
cheque
he
signed
often
gave
rise
to
the
thought
i
suppose
she
just
manages
sliding
into
a
vague
wonder
how
she
was
faring
otherwise
in
a
world
of
men
not
wont
to
let
beauty
go
unpossessed
at
first
holly
had
spoken
of
her
sometimes
but
in
grey
soon
fade
from
children
memories
and
the
tightening
of
june
lips
in
those
first
weeks
after
her
grandfather
death
whenever
her
former
friend
name
was
mentioned
had
discouraged
allusion
only
once
indeed
had
june
spoken
definitely
i
forgiven
her
i
frightfully
glad
independent
now
on
receiving
soames
card
jolyon
said
to
the
he
could
not
abide
show
him
into
the
study
please
and
say
i
be
there
in
a
minute
and
then
he
looked
at
holly
and
asked
do
you
remember
lady
in
grey
who
used
to
give
you
oh
yes
why
has
she
come
jolyon
shook
his
head
and
changing
his
holland
blouse
for
a
coat
was
silent
perceiving
suddenly
that
such
history
was
not
for
those
young
ears
his
face
in
fact
became
whimsical
perplexity
incarnate
while
he
journeyed
towards
the
study
standing
by
the
looking
out
across
the
terrace
at
the
oak
tree
were
two
figures
and
young
and
he
thought
that
boy
surely
they
never
had
a
child
the
elder
figure
turned
the
meeting
of
those
two
forsytes
of
the
second
generation
so
much
more
sophisticated
than
the
first
in
the
house
built
for
the
one
and
owned
and
occupied
by
the
other
was
marked
by
subtle
defensiveness
beneath
distinct
attempt
at
cordiality
he
come
about
his
wife
jolyon
was
thinking
and
soames
shall
i
begin
while
val
brought
to
break
the
ice
stood
negligently
scrutinising
this
pard
from
under
his
dark
thick
eyelashes
this
is
val
dartie
said
soames
my
sister
son
he
just
going
up
to
oxford
i
thought
i
like
him
to
know
your
ah
i
sorry
jolly
away
what
college
replied
val
jolly
at
the
but
he
be
delighted
to
look
you
thanks
holly
you
could
put
up
with
a
female
relation
she
show
you
round
you
find
her
in
the
hall
if
you
go
through
the
curtains
i
was
just
painting
with
another
thanks
awfully
val
vanished
leaving
the
two
cousins
with
the
ice
unbroken
i
see
you
some
drawings
at
the
colours
said
soames
jolyon
winced
he
had
been
out
of
touch
with
the
forsyte
family
at
large
for
years
but
they
were
connected
in
his
mind
with
day
and
landseer
prints
he
had
heard
from
june
that
soames
was
a
connoisseur
which
made
it
worse
he
had
become
aware
too
of
a
curious
sensation
of
repugnance
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
he
said
no
answered
soames
between
close
lips
not
a
matter
of
fact
it
about
that
i
come
you
her
trustee
i
jolyon
nodded
twelve
years
is
a
long
time
said
soames
rapidly
tired
of
jolyon
found
no
more
appropriate
answer
than
wo
you
smoke
no
jolyon
himself
lit
a
cigarette
i
wish
to
be
free
said
soames
abruptly
i
do
see
her
murmured
jolyon
through
the
fume
of
his
cigarette
but
you
know
where
she
lives
i
suppose
jolyon
nodded
he
did
not
mean
to
give
her
address
without
permission
soames
seemed
to
divine
his
thought
i
do
want
her
address
he
said
i
know
what
exactly
do
you
want
she
deserted
me
i
want
a
rather
late
in
the
day
is
it
yes
said
soames
and
there
was
a
silence
i
do
know
much
about
these
least
i
forgotten
said
jolyon
with
a
wry
smile
he
himself
had
had
to
wait
for
death
to
grant
him
a
divorce
from
the
first
jolyon
do
you
wish
me
to
see
her
about
it
soames
raised
his
eyes
to
his
cousin
face
i
suppose
someone
he
said
a
shrug
moved
jolyon
shoulders
i
do
know
at
all
i
imagine
you
may
have
both
lived
as
if
the
other
were
dead
it
usual
in
these
soames
turned
to
the
window
a
few
early
fallen
strewed
the
terrace
already
and
were
rolling
round
in
the
wind
jolyon
saw
the
figures
of
holly
and
val
dartie
moving
across
the
lawn
towards
the
stables
not
going
to
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
he
thought
must
act
for
her
the
dad
would
have
wished
that
and
for
a
swift
moment
he
seemed
to
see
his
father
figure
in
the
old
armchair
just
beyond
soames
sitting
with
knees
crossed
the
times
in
his
hand
it
vanished
my
father
was
fond
of
her
he
said
quietly
why
he
should
have
been
i
do
know
soames
answered
without
looking
round
she
brought
trouble
to
your
daughter
june
she
brought
trouble
to
everyone
i
gave
her
all
she
wanted
i
would
have
given
her
she
chose
to
leave
in
jolyon
compassion
was
checked
by
the
tone
of
that
close
voice
what
was
there
in
the
fellow
that
made
it
so
difficult
to
be
sorry
for
him
i
can
go
and
see
her
if
you
like
he
said
i
suppose
she
might
be
glad
of
a
divorce
but
i
know
soames
nodded
yes
please
go
as
i
say
i
know
her
address
but
i
no
wish
to
see
his
tongue
was
busy
with
his
lips
as
if
they
were
very
dry
you
have
some
tea
said
jolyon
stifling
the
words
see
the
house
and
he
led
the
way
into
the
hall
when
he
had
rung
the
bell
and
ordered
tea
he
went
to
his
easel
to
turn
his
drawing
to
the
wall
he
could
not
bear
somehow
that
his
work
should
be
seen
by
soames
who
was
standing
there
in
the
middle
of
the
great
room
which
had
been
designed
expressly
to
afford
wall
space
for
his
own
pictures
in
his
face
with
its
unseizable
family
likeness
to
himself
and
its
chinny
narrow
concentrated
look
jolyon
saw
that
which
moved
him
to
the
thought
chap
could
never
forget
ever
give
himself
away
he
pathetic
chapter
colt
and
the
filly
when
young
val
left
the
presence
of
the
last
generation
he
was
thinking
is
jolly
dull
uncle
soames
does
take
the
bun
i
wonder
what
this
filly
like
he
anticipated
no
pleasure
from
her
society
and
suddenly
he
saw
her
standing
there
looking
at
him
why
she
was
pretty
what
luck
i
afraid
you
do
know
me
he
said
my
name
val
once
removed
second
cousin
something
like
that
you
know
my
mother
name
was
holly
whose
slim
brown
hand
remained
in
his
because
she
was
too
shy
to
withdraw
it
said
i
do
know
any
of
my
relations
are
there
many
tons
they
of
them
at
least
i
do
of
them
one
relations
always
are
are
they
i
expect
they
think
one
awful
too
said
holly
i
do
know
why
they
should
no
one
could
think
you
awful
of
holly
looked
at
wistful
candour
in
those
grey
eyes
gave
young
val
a
sudden
feeling
that
he
must
protect
her
i
mean
there
are
people
and
people
he
added
astutely
your
dad
looks
awfully
decent
for
oh
yes
said
holly
fervently
he
a
flush
mounted
in
val
scene
in
the
pandemonium
dark
man
with
the
pink
carnation
developing
into
his
own
father
but
you
know
what
the
forsytes
are
he
said
almost
viciously
oh
i
forgot
you
what
are
they
oh
fearfully
careful
not
sportsmen
a
bit
look
at
uncle
soames
i
like
to
said
holly
val
resisted
a
desire
to
run
his
arm
through
hers
oh
no
he
said
let
go
out
you
see
him
quite
soon
enough
what
your
brother
like
holly
led
the
way
on
to
the
terrace
and
down
to
the
lawn
without
answering
how
describe
jolly
who
ever
since
she
remembered
anything
had
been
her
lord
master
and
ideal
does
he
sit
on
you
said
val
shrewdly
i
shall
be
knowing
him
at
oxford
have
you
got
any
horses
holly
nodded
would
you
like
to
see
the
stables
rather
they
passed
under
the
oak
tree
through
a
thin
shrubbery
into
the
there
under
a
lay
a
fluffy
dog
so
old
that
he
did
not
get
up
but
faintly
waved
the
tail
curled
over
his
back
that
balthasar
said
holly
he
so
old
nearly
as
old
as
i
am
poor
old
boy
he
devoted
to
balthasar
that
a
rum
name
he
is
purebred
you
no
but
he
a
darling
and
she
bent
down
to
stroke
the
dog
gentle
and
supple
with
dark
covered
head
and
slim
browned
neck
and
hands
she
seemed
to
val
strange
and
sweet
like
a
thing
slipped
between
him
and
all
previous
knowledge
when
grandfather
died
she
said
he
would
eat
for
two
days
he
saw
him
die
you
was
that
old
uncle
jolyon
mother
always
says
he
was
a
he
was
said
holly
simply
and
opened
the
stable
door
in
a
stood
a
silver
roan
of
about
fifteen
hands
with
a
long
black
tail
and
mane
this
is
ah
said
val
she
a
jolly
palfrey
but
you
ought
to
bang
her
tail
she
look
much
then
catching
her
wondering
look
he
thought
suddenly
do
she
likes
and
he
took
a
long
sniff
of
the
stable
air
horses
are
ripping
are
they
my
dad
he
stopped
yes
said
holly
an
impulse
to
unbosom
himself
almost
overcame
not
quite
oh
i
do
know
he
often
gone
a
mucker
over
them
i
jolly
keen
on
them
and
hunting
i
like
racing
awfully
as
well
i
should
like
to
be
a
gentleman
and
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
but
one
more
day
in
town
with
two
engagements
he
plumped
out
i
say
if
i
hire
a
gee
will
you
come
a
ride
in
richmond
park
holly
clasped
her
hands
oh
yes
i
simply
love
riding
but
there
jolly
horse
why
do
you
ride
him
here
he
is
we
could
go
after
val
looked
doubtfully
at
his
trousered
legs
he
had
imagined
them
immaculate
before
her
eyes
in
high
brown
boots
and
bedford
cords
i
do
much
like
riding
his
horse
he
said
he
might
like
it
besides
uncle
soames
wants
to
get
back
i
expect
not
that
i
believe
in
buckling
under
to
him
you
know
you
have
got
an
uncle
have
you
this
is
rather
a
good
beast
he
added
scrutinising
jolly
horse
a
dark
brown
which
was
showing
the
whites
of
its
eyes
you
have
got
any
hunting
here
i
suppose
no
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
hunt
it
must
be
awfully
exciting
of
course
but
it
cruel
is
it
june
says
cruel
ejaculated
val
oh
that
all
rot
who
june
my
you
older
than
she
had
put
her
hands
up
to
both
cheeks
of
jolly
horse
and
was
rubbing
her
nose
against
its
nose
with
a
gentle
snuffling
noise
which
seemed
to
have
an
hypnotic
effect
on
the
animal
val
contemplated
her
cheek
resting
against
the
horse
nose
and
her
eyes
gleaming
round
at
him
really
a
duck
he
thought
they
returned
to
the
house
less
talkative
followed
this
time
by
the
dog
balthasar
walking
more
slowly
than
anything
on
earth
and
clearly
expecting
them
not
to
exceed
his
speed
limit
this
is
a
ripping
place
said
val
from
under
the
oak
tree
where
they
had
paused
to
allow
the
dog
balthasar
to
come
up
yes
said
holly
and
sighed
of
course
i
want
to
go
everywhere
i
wish
i
were
a
yes
gipsies
are
jolly
replied
val
with
a
conviction
which
had
just
come
to
him
you
rather
like
one
you
holly
face
shone
suddenly
and
deeply
like
dark
leaves
gilded
by
the
sun
to
go
everywhere
and
see
everything
and
live
in
the
would
it
be
fun
let
do
it
said
val
oh
yes
let
it
be
grand
sport
just
you
and
then
holly
perceived
the
quaintness
and
gushed
well
we
got
to
do
it
said
val
obstinately
but
reddening
too
i
believe
in
doing
things
you
want
to
do
what
down
there
the
and
the
pond
and
the
coppice
and
the
let
go
down
holly
glanced
back
at
the
house
it
i
expect
there
dad
val
uttering
a
growly
sound
followed
her
towards
the
house
when
they
the
hall
gallery
the
sight
of
two
forsytes
drinking
tea
together
had
its
magical
effect
and
they
became
quite
silent
it
was
indeed
an
impressive
spectacle
the
two
were
seated
side
by
side
on
an
arrangement
in
marqueterie
which
looked
like
three
silvery
pink
chairs
made
one
with
a
low
in
front
of
them
they
seemed
to
have
taken
up
that
position
as
far
apart
as
the
seat
would
permit
so
that
they
need
not
look
at
each
other
too
much
and
they
were
eating
and
drinking
rather
than
with
his
air
of
despising
the
as
it
disappeared
jolyon
of
finding
himself
slightly
amusing
to
the
casual
eye
neither
would
have
seemed
greedy
but
both
were
getting
through
a
good
deal
of
sustenance
the
two
young
ones
having
been
supplied
with
food
the
process
went
on
silent
and
absorbative
till
with
the
advent
of
cigarettes
jolyon
said
to
soames
and
how
uncle
james
thanks
very
we
a
wonderful
family
are
we
the
other
day
i
was
calculating
the
average
age
of
the
ten
old
forsytes
from
my
father
family
bible
i
make
it
already
and
five
still
living
they
ought
to
beat
the
record
and
looking
whimsically
at
soames
he
added
we
are
the
men
they
were
you
soames
smiled
you
really
think
i
shall
admit
that
i
not
their
equal
he
seemed
to
be
saying
that
i
got
to
give
up
anything
especially
life
we
may
live
to
their
age
perhaps
pursued
jolyon
but
is
a
handicap
you
know
and
that
the
difference
between
us
we
lost
conviction
how
and
when
was
born
i
never
can
make
out
my
father
had
a
little
but
i
do
believe
any
other
of
the
old
forsytes
ever
had
a
scrap
never
to
see
yourself
as
others
see
you
it
a
wonderful
preservative
the
whole
history
of
the
last
century
is
in
the
difference
between
us
and
between
us
and
you
he
added
gazing
through
a
ring
of
smoke
at
val
and
holly
uncomfortable
under
his
quizzical
regard
there
difference
i
wonder
soames
took
out
his
watch
we
must
go
he
said
if
we
to
catch
our
uncle
soames
never
misses
a
train
muttered
val
with
his
mouth
full
why
should
i
soames
answered
simply
oh
i
do
know
grumbled
val
other
people
at
the
front
door
he
gave
holly
slim
brown
hand
a
long
and
surreptitious
squeeze
look
out
for
me
he
whispered
three
i
wait
for
you
in
the
road
it
save
time
we
have
a
ripping
he
gazed
back
at
her
from
the
lodge
gate
and
but
for
the
principles
of
a
man
about
town
would
have
waved
his
hand
he
felt
in
no
mood
to
tolerate
his
uncle
conversation
but
he
was
not
in
danger
soames
preserved
a
perfect
muteness
busy
with
thoughts
the
yellow
leaves
came
down
about
those
two
walking
the
mile
and
a
half
which
soames
had
traversed
so
often
in
those
days
when
he
came
down
to
watch
with
secret
pride
the
building
of
the
house
which
was
to
have
been
the
home
of
him
and
her
from
whom
he
was
now
going
to
seek
release
he
looked
back
once
up
that
endless
vista
of
autumn
lane
between
the
yellowing
hedges
what
an
age
ago
i
do
want
to
see
her
he
had
said
to
jolyon
was
that
true
may
have
to
he
thought
and
he
shivered
seized
by
one
of
those
queer
shudderings
that
they
say
mean
footsteps
on
one
grave
a
chilly
world
a
queer
world
and
glancing
sidelong
at
his
nephew
he
thought
i
were
his
age
i
wonder
what
she
like
now
chapter
prosecutes
trusteeship
when
those
two
were
gone
jolyon
did
not
return
to
his
painting
for
daylight
was
failing
but
went
to
the
study
craving
unconsciously
a
revival
of
that
momentary
vision
of
his
father
sitting
in
the
old
leather
chair
with
his
knees
crossed
and
his
straight
eyes
gazing
up
from
under
the
dome
of
his
massive
brow
often
in
this
little
room
cosiest
in
the
house
jolyon
would
catch
a
moment
of
communion
with
his
father
not
indeed
that
he
had
definitely
any
faith
in
the
persistence
of
the
human
feeling
was
not
so
was
rather
an
atmospheric
impact
like
a
scent
or
one
of
those
strong
animistic
impressions
from
forms
or
effects
of
light
to
which
those
with
the
artist
eye
are
especially
prone
here
this
little
unchanged
room
where
his
father
had
spent
the
most
of
his
waking
be
retrieved
the
feeling
that
he
was
not
quite
gone
that
the
steady
counsel
of
that
old
spirit
and
the
warmth
of
his
masterful
lovability
endured
what
would
his
father
be
advising
now
in
this
sudden
recrudescence
of
an
old
would
he
say
to
this
menace
against
her
to
whom
he
had
taken
such
a
fancy
in
the
last
weeks
of
his
life
must
do
my
best
for
her
thought
jolyon
left
her
to
me
in
his
will
but
what
is
the
best
and
as
if
seeking
to
regain
the
sapience
the
balance
and
shrewd
common
sense
of
that
old
forsyte
he
sat
down
in
the
ancient
chair
and
crossed
his
knees
but
he
felt
a
mere
shadow
sitting
there
nor
did
any
inspiration
come
while
the
fingers
of
the
wind
tapped
on
the
darkening
panes
of
the
and
see
her
he
thought
ask
her
to
come
down
here
what
her
life
been
what
is
it
now
i
wonder
beastly
to
rake
up
things
at
this
time
of
day
again
the
figure
of
his
cousin
standing
with
a
hand
on
a
front
door
of
a
fine
leaped
out
vivid
like
one
of
those
figures
from
clocks
when
the
hour
strikes
and
his
words
sounded
in
jolyon
ears
clearer
than
any
chime
i
manage
my
own
affairs
i
told
you
once
i
tell
you
again
we
are
not
at
the
repugnance
he
had
then
felt
for
his
shaven
face
full
of
spiritual
for
his
spare
square
sleek
figure
slightly
crouched
as
it
were
over
the
bone
he
could
not
now
again
fresh
as
ever
nay
with
an
odd
increase
dislike
him
he
thought
dislike
him
to
the
very
roots
of
me
and
that
lucky
make
it
easier
for
me
to
back
his
wife
and
jolyon
was
constitutionally
averse
from
what
he
termed
unless
angered
he
conformed
deeply
to
that
classic
description
of
the
ruther
run
than
fight
a
little
smile
became
settled
in
his
beard
ironical
that
soames
should
come
down
this
house
built
for
himself
how
he
had
gazed
and
gaped
at
this
ruin
of
his
past
intention
furtively
nosing
at
the
walls
and
stairway
appraising
everything
and
intuitively
jolyon
thought
believe
the
fellow
even
now
would
like
to
be
living
here
he
could
never
leave
off
longing
for
what
he
once
owned
well
i
must
act
somehow
or
other
but
it
a
great
bore
late
that
evening
he
wrote
to
the
chelsea
flat
asking
if
irene
would
see
him
the
old
century
which
had
seen
the
plant
of
individualism
flower
so
wonderfully
was
setting
in
a
sky
orange
with
coming
storms
rumours
of
war
added
to
the
briskness
of
a
london
turbulent
at
the
close
of
the
summer
holidays
and
the
streets
to
jolyon
who
was
not
often
up
in
town
had
a
feverish
look
due
to
these
new
motorcars
and
cabs
of
which
he
disapproved
aesthetically
he
counted
these
vehicles
from
his
hansom
and
made
the
proportion
of
them
one
in
twenty
were
one
in
thirty
about
a
year
ago
he
thought
come
to
stay
just
so
much
more
rattling
round
of
wheels
and
general
he
was
one
of
those
rather
rare
liberals
who
object
to
anything
new
when
it
takes
a
material
form
and
he
instructed
his
driver
to
get
down
to
the
river
quickly
out
of
the
traffic
desiring
to
look
at
the
water
through
the
mellowing
screen
of
at
the
little
block
of
flats
which
stood
back
some
fifty
yards
from
the
embankment
he
told
the
cabman
to
wait
and
went
up
to
the
first
floor
yes
heron
was
at
home
the
effect
of
a
settled
if
very
modest
income
was
at
once
apparent
to
him
remembering
the
threadbare
refinement
in
that
tiny
flat
eight
years
ago
when
he
announced
her
good
fortune
everything
was
now
fresh
dainty
and
smelled
of
flowers
the
general
effect
was
silvery
with
touches
of
black
hydrangea
colour
and
gold
woman
of
great
taste
he
thought
time
had
dealt
gently
with
jolyon
for
he
was
a
forsyte
but
with
irene
time
hardly
seemed
to
deal
at
all
or
such
was
his
impression
she
appeared
to
him
not
a
day
older
standing
there
in
velvet
corduroy
with
soft
dark
eyes
and
dark
gold
hair
with
outstretched
hand
and
a
little
smile
wo
you
sit
down
he
had
probably
never
occupied
a
chair
with
a
fuller
sense
of
embarrassment
you
look
absolutely
unchanged
he
said
and
you
look
younger
cousin
jolyon
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
whose
thickness
was
still
a
comfort
to
him
i
ancient
but
i
do
feel
it
that
one
thing
about
painting
it
keeps
you
young
titian
lived
to
and
had
to
have
plague
to
kill
him
off
do
you
know
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
i
thought
of
a
picture
by
him
when
did
you
see
me
for
the
first
time
in
the
botanical
how
did
you
know
me
if
you
never
seen
me
before
by
someone
who
came
up
to
he
was
looking
at
her
hardily
but
her
face
did
not
change
and
she
said
quietly
yes
many
lives
what
is
your
recipe
for
youth
irene
people
who
do
live
are
wonderfully
h
a
bitter
little
saying
people
who
do
live
but
an
opening
and
he
took
it
you
remember
my
cousin
soames
he
saw
her
smile
faintly
at
that
whimsicality
and
at
once
went
on
he
came
to
see
me
the
day
before
yesterday
he
wants
a
divorce
do
you
i
the
word
seemed
startled
out
of
her
after
twelve
years
rather
late
wo
it
be
difficult
jolyon
looked
hard
into
her
face
unless
he
said
unless
i
have
a
lover
now
but
i
have
never
had
one
what
did
he
feel
at
the
simplicity
and
candour
of
those
words
relief
surprise
pity
venus
for
twelve
years
without
a
lover
and
yet
he
said
i
suppose
you
would
give
a
good
deal
to
be
free
too
i
do
know
what
does
it
matter
now
but
if
you
were
to
love
again
i
should
in
that
simple
answer
she
seemed
to
sum
up
the
whole
philosophy
of
one
on
whom
the
world
had
turned
its
back
well
is
there
anything
you
would
like
me
to
say
to
him
only
that
i
sorry
he
not
free
he
had
his
chance
once
i
do
know
why
he
did
take
because
he
was
a
forsyte
we
never
part
with
things
you
know
unless
we
want
something
in
their
place
and
not
always
irene
smiled
do
you
cousin
jolyon
think
you
of
course
i
a
bit
of
a
quite
a
pure
forsyte
i
never
take
the
halfpennies
off
my
cheques
i
put
them
on
said
jolyon
uneasily
well
what
does
soames
want
in
place
of
me
now
i
do
know
perhaps
she
was
silent
for
a
little
looking
down
yes
she
murmured
it
hard
i
would
help
him
to
be
free
if
i
jolyon
gazed
into
his
hat
his
embarrassment
was
increasing
fast
so
was
his
admiration
his
wonder
and
his
pity
she
was
so
lovely
and
so
lonely
and
altogether
it
was
such
a
coil
well
he
said
i
shall
have
to
see
soames
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
always
at
your
service
you
must
think
of
me
as
a
wretched
substitute
for
my
father
at
all
events
i
let
you
know
what
happens
when
i
speak
to
soames
he
may
supply
the
material
she
shook
her
head
you
see
he
has
a
lot
to
lose
and
i
have
nothing
i
should
like
him
to
be
free
but
i
do
see
what
i
can
nor
i
at
the
moment
said
jolyon
and
soon
after
took
his
leave
he
went
down
to
his
hansom
three
soames
would
be
at
his
office
still
to
the
poultry
he
called
through
the
trap
in
front
of
the
houses
of
parliament
and
in
whitehall
newsvendors
were
calling
grave
situation
in
the
transvaal
but
the
cries
hardly
roused
him
absorbed
in
recollection
of
that
very
beautiful
figure
of
her
soft
dark
glance
and
the
words
i
have
never
had
one
what
on
earth
did
such
a
woman
do
with
her
life
like
this
solitary
unprotected
with
every
man
hand
against
her
or
out
to
grasp
her
at
the
least
sign
and
year
after
year
she
went
on
like
that
the
word
above
the
passing
citizens
brought
him
back
to
reality
bustard
and
forsyte
in
black
letters
on
a
ground
the
colour
of
peasoup
spurred
him
to
a
sort
of
vigour
and
he
went
up
the
stone
stairs
muttering
fusty
musty
ownerships
well
we
could
do
without
them
i
want
soames
forsyte
he
said
to
the
boy
who
opened
the
door
what
name
mr
jolyon
the
youth
looked
at
him
curiously
never
having
seen
a
forsyte
with
a
beard
and
vanished
the
offices
of
bustard
and
forsyte
had
slowly
absorbed
the
offices
of
and
bowles
and
occupied
the
whole
of
the
first
floor
the
firm
consisted
now
of
nothing
but
soames
and
a
number
of
managing
and
articled
clerks
the
complete
retirement
of
james
some
six
years
ago
had
accelerated
business
to
which
the
final
touch
of
speed
had
been
imparted
when
bustard
dropped
off
worn
out
as
many
believed
by
the
suit
of
versus
forsyte
more
in
chancery
than
ever
and
less
likely
to
benefit
its
beneficiaries
soames
with
his
saner
grasp
of
actualities
had
never
permitted
it
to
worry
him
on
the
contrary
he
had
long
perceived
that
providence
had
presented
him
therein
with
a
year
net
in
perpetuity
not
when
jolyon
entered
his
cousin
was
drawing
out
a
list
of
holdings
in
consols
which
in
view
of
the
rumours
of
war
he
was
going
to
advise
his
companies
to
put
on
the
market
at
once
before
other
companies
did
the
same
he
looked
round
sidelong
and
said
how
are
you
just
one
minute
sit
down
wo
you
and
having
entered
three
amounts
and
set
a
ruler
to
keep
his
place
he
turned
towards
jolyon
biting
the
side
of
his
flat
forefinger
yes
he
said
i
have
seen
soames
frowned
well
she
has
remained
faithful
to
having
said
that
jolyon
was
ashamed
his
cousin
had
flushed
a
dusky
yellowish
red
what
had
made
him
tease
the
poor
brute
i
was
to
tell
you
she
is
sorry
you
are
not
free
twelve
years
is
a
long
time
you
know
your
law
and
what
chance
it
gives
soames
uttered
a
curious
little
grunt
and
the
two
remained
a
full
minute
without
speaking
wax
thought
jolyon
watching
that
close
face
where
the
flush
was
fast
subsiding
never
give
me
a
sign
of
what
thinking
or
going
to
do
like
wax
and
he
transferred
his
gaze
to
a
plan
of
that
flourishing
town
on
sea
the
future
existence
of
which
lay
exposed
on
the
wall
to
the
possessive
instincts
of
the
firm
clients
the
whimsical
thought
flashed
through
him
wonder
if
i
shall
get
a
bill
of
costs
for
to
attending
jolyon
forsyte
in
the
matter
of
my
divorce
to
receiving
his
account
of
his
visit
to
my
wife
and
to
advising
him
to
go
and
see
her
again
sixteen
and
suddenly
soames
said
i
ca
go
on
like
this
i
tell
you
i
go
on
like
his
eyes
were
shifting
from
side
to
side
like
an
animal
when
it
looks
for
way
of
escape
really
suffers
thought
jolyon
no
business
to
forget
that
just
because
i
do
like
him
surely
he
said
gently
it
lies
with
yourself
a
man
can
always
put
these
things
through
if
he
take
it
on
soames
turned
square
to
him
with
a
sound
which
seemed
to
come
from
somewhere
very
deep
why
should
i
suffer
more
than
i
suffered
already
why
should
i
jolyon
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
his
reason
agreed
his
instinct
rebelled
he
could
not
have
said
why
your
father
went
on
soames
took
an
interest
in
goodness
knows
and
i
suppose
you
do
too
he
gave
jolyon
a
sharp
look
it
seems
to
me
that
one
only
has
to
do
another
person
a
wrong
to
get
all
the
sympathy
i
do
know
in
what
way
i
was
to
never
known
i
always
treated
her
well
i
gave
her
everything
she
could
wish
for
i
wanted
again
jolyon
reason
nodded
again
his
instinct
shook
its
head
is
it
he
thought
must
be
something
wrong
in
me
yet
if
there
is
i
rather
be
wrong
than
right
after
all
said
soames
with
a
sort
of
glum
fierceness
she
was
my
in
a
flash
the
thought
went
through
his
listener
it
is
ownerships
well
we
all
own
things
beings
pah
you
have
to
look
at
facts
he
said
drily
or
rather
the
want
of
soames
gave
him
another
quick
suspicious
look
the
want
of
them
he
said
yes
but
i
am
not
so
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
jolyon
i
told
you
what
she
said
it
was
my
experience
has
not
been
one
to
promote
blind
confidence
in
her
word
we
shall
jolyon
got
up
he
said
curtly
returned
soames
and
jolyon
went
out
trying
to
understand
the
look
on
his
cousin
face
he
sought
waterloo
station
in
a
disturbed
frame
of
mind
as
though
the
skin
of
his
moral
being
had
been
scraped
and
all
the
way
down
in
the
train
he
thought
of
irene
in
her
lonely
flat
and
of
soames
in
his
lonely
office
and
of
the
strange
paralysis
of
life
that
lay
on
them
both
chancery
he
thought
their
necks
in
her
so
pretty
chapter
hears
the
news
the
keeping
of
engagements
had
not
as
yet
been
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
life
of
young
val
dartie
so
that
when
he
broke
two
and
kept
one
it
was
the
latter
event
which
caused
him
if
anything
the
greater
surprise
while
jogging
back
to
town
from
robin
hill
after
his
ride
with
holly
she
had
been
even
prettier
than
he
had
thought
her
yesterday
on
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
in
the
brumous
october
gloaming
and
the
outskirts
of
london
that
only
his
boots
had
shone
throughout
their
companionship
he
took
out
his
new
gold
from
looked
not
at
the
time
but
at
sections
of
his
face
in
the
glittering
back
of
its
opened
case
he
had
a
temporary
spot
over
one
eyebrow
and
it
displeased
him
for
it
must
have
displeased
her
crum
never
had
any
spots
together
with
crum
rose
the
scene
in
the
promenade
of
the
pandemonium
he
had
not
had
the
faintest
desire
to
unbosom
himself
to
holly
about
his
father
his
father
lacked
poetry
the
stirrings
of
which
he
was
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
his
nineteen
years
the
liberty
with
cynthia
dark
that
almost
mythical
embodiment
of
rapture
the
pandemonium
with
the
woman
of
uncertain
seemed
to
val
completely
fresh
from
communion
with
this
new
shy
young
cousin
of
his
she
rode
well
too
so
that
it
had
been
all
the
more
flattering
that
she
had
let
him
lead
her
where
he
would
in
the
long
gallops
of
richmond
park
though
she
knew
them
so
much
better
than
he
did
looking
back
on
it
all
he
was
mystified
by
the
barrenness
of
his
speech
he
felt
that
he
could
say
awful
lot
of
fetching
things
if
he
had
but
the
chance
again
and
the
thought
that
he
must
go
back
to
littlehampton
on
the
morrow
and
to
oxford
on
the
that
beastly
exam
the
faintest
chance
of
first
seeing
her
again
caused
darkness
to
settle
on
his
spirit
even
more
quickly
than
on
the
evening
he
should
write
to
her
however
and
she
had
promised
to
answer
perhaps
too
she
would
come
up
to
oxford
to
see
her
brother
that
thought
was
like
the
first
star
which
came
out
as
he
rode
into
padwick
livery
stables
in
the
purlieus
of
sloane
square
he
got
off
and
stretched
himself
luxuriously
for
he
had
ridden
some
good
miles
the
dartie
within
him
made
him
chaffer
for
five
minutes
with
young
padwick
concerning
the
favourite
for
the
cambridgeshire
then
with
the
words
put
the
gee
down
to
my
account
he
walked
away
a
little
wide
at
the
knees
and
flipping
his
boots
with
his
knotty
little
cane
do
feel
a
bit
inclined
to
go
out
he
thought
wonder
if
mother
will
stand
fizz
for
my
last
night
with
and
recollection
he
could
well
pass
a
domestic
evening
when
he
came
down
speckless
after
his
bath
he
found
his
mother
scrupulous
in
a
low
evening
dress
and
to
his
annoyance
his
uncle
soames
they
stopped
talking
when
he
came
in
then
his
uncle
said
he
better
be
at
those
words
which
meant
something
about
his
father
of
course
first
thought
was
of
holly
was
it
anything
beastly
his
mother
began
speaking
your
father
she
said
in
her
fashionably
appointed
voice
while
her
fingers
plucked
rather
pitifully
at
brocade
your
father
my
dear
boy
not
at
newmarket
he
on
his
way
to
south
america
left
val
looked
from
her
to
soames
left
them
was
he
sorry
was
he
fond
of
his
father
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
did
not
know
then
at
a
whiff
of
gardenias
and
heart
twitched
within
him
and
he
was
sorry
one
father
belonged
to
one
could
not
go
off
in
this
was
not
done
nor
had
he
always
been
the
of
the
pandemonium
promenade
there
were
precious
memories
of
tailors
shops
and
horses
tips
at
school
and
general
lavish
kindness
when
in
luck
but
why
he
said
then
as
a
sportsman
himself
was
sorry
he
had
asked
the
mask
of
his
mother
face
was
all
disturbed
and
he
burst
out
all
right
mother
do
tell
me
only
what
does
it
mean
a
divorce
val
i
val
uttered
a
queer
little
grunt
and
looked
quickly
at
his
uncle
whom
he
had
been
taught
to
look
on
as
a
guarantee
against
the
consequences
of
having
a
father
even
against
the
dartie
blood
in
his
own
veins
the
visage
seemed
to
wince
and
this
upset
him
it
wo
be
public
will
it
so
vividly
before
him
had
come
recollection
of
his
own
eyes
glued
to
the
unsavoury
details
of
many
a
divorce
suit
in
the
public
press
ca
it
be
done
quietly
somehow
it
so
disgusting
mother
everything
will
be
done
as
quietly
as
it
can
you
may
be
why
is
it
necessary
at
all
mother
does
want
to
marry
himself
the
girls
their
name
tarnished
in
the
sight
of
his
schoolfellows
and
of
crum
of
the
men
at
oxford
unbearable
what
was
to
be
gained
by
it
do
you
mother
he
said
sharply
thus
brought
face
to
face
with
so
much
of
her
own
feeling
by
the
one
she
loved
best
in
the
world
winifred
rose
from
the
empire
chair
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
she
saw
that
her
son
would
be
against
her
unless
he
was
told
everything
and
yet
how
could
she
tell
him
thus
still
plucking
at
the
green
brocade
she
stared
at
soames
val
too
stared
at
soames
surely
this
embodiment
of
respectability
and
the
sense
of
property
could
not
wish
to
bring
such
a
slur
on
his
own
sister
soames
slowly
passed
a
little
inlaid
paperknife
over
the
smooth
surface
of
a
marqueterie
table
then
without
looking
at
his
nephew
he
began
you
do
understand
what
your
mother
has
had
to
put
up
with
these
twenty
years
this
is
only
the
last
straw
and
glancing
up
sideways
at
winifred
he
added
shall
i
tell
him
winifred
was
silent
if
he
were
not
told
he
would
be
against
her
yet
how
dreadful
to
be
told
such
things
of
his
own
father
clenching
her
lips
she
nodded
soames
spoke
in
a
rapid
even
voice
he
has
always
been
a
burden
round
your
mother
neck
she
has
paid
his
debts
over
and
over
again
he
has
often
been
drunk
abused
and
threatened
her
and
now
he
is
gone
to
buenos
aires
with
a
and
as
if
distrusting
the
efficacy
of
those
words
on
the
boy
he
went
on
quickly
he
took
your
mother
pearls
to
give
to
val
jerked
up
his
hand
then
at
that
signal
of
distress
winifred
cried
out
that
do
in
the
boy
the
dartie
and
the
forsyte
were
struggling
for
debts
drink
dancers
he
had
a
certain
sympathy
but
the
that
was
too
much
and
suddenly
he
found
his
mother
hand
squeezing
his
you
see
he
heard
soames
say
we
ca
have
it
all
begin
over
again
there
a
limit
we
must
strike
while
the
iron
val
freed
his
hand
going
to
bring
out
that
about
the
pearls
i
stand
simply
could
winifred
cried
out
no
no
no
that
only
to
show
you
how
impossible
your
father
is
and
his
uncle
nodded
somewhat
assuaged
val
took
out
a
cigarette
his
father
had
bought
him
that
thin
curved
case
oh
it
was
as
he
was
going
up
to
oxford
ca
mother
be
protected
without
he
said
i
could
look
after
her
it
could
always
be
done
later
if
it
was
really
a
smile
played
for
a
moment
round
soames
lips
and
became
bitter
you
do
know
what
you
talking
of
nothing
so
fatal
as
delay
in
such
why
i
tell
you
boy
nothing
so
fatal
i
know
from
his
voice
had
the
ring
of
exasperation
val
regarded
him
never
having
known
his
uncle
express
any
sort
of
feeling
oh
remembered
had
been
an
aunt
irene
and
something
had
which
people
kept
dark
he
had
heard
his
father
once
use
an
unmentionable
word
of
her
i
do
want
to
speak
ill
of
your
father
soames
went
on
doggedly
but
i
know
him
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
be
back
on
your
mother
hands
before
a
year
over
you
can
imagine
what
that
will
mean
to
her
and
to
all
of
you
after
this
the
only
thing
is
to
cut
the
knot
for
in
spite
of
himself
val
was
impressed
and
happening
to
look
at
his
mother
face
he
got
what
was
perhaps
his
first
real
insight
into
the
fact
that
his
own
feelings
were
not
always
what
mattered
most
all
right
mother
he
said
we
back
you
up
only
i
like
to
know
when
it
be
it
my
first
term
you
know
i
do
want
to
be
up
there
when
it
comes
oh
my
dear
boy
murmured
winifred
it
is
a
bore
for
so
by
habit
she
phrased
what
from
the
expression
of
her
face
was
the
most
poignant
regret
when
will
it
be
soames
ca
for
months
we
must
get
restitution
the
deuce
is
that
thought
val
silly
brutes
lawyers
are
not
for
months
i
know
one
thing
i
not
going
to
dine
in
and
he
said
awfully
sorry
mother
i
got
to
go
out
to
dinner
though
it
was
his
last
night
winifred
nodded
almost
gratefully
they
both
felt
that
they
had
gone
quite
far
enough
in
the
expression
of
feeling
val
sought
the
misty
freedom
of
green
street
reckless
and
depressed
and
not
till
he
reached
piccadilly
did
he
discover
that
he
had
only
one
could
dine
off
and
he
was
very
hungry
he
looked
longingly
at
the
windows
of
the
iseeum
club
where
he
had
often
eaten
of
the
best
with
his
father
those
pearls
there
was
no
getting
over
them
but
the
more
he
brooded
and
the
further
he
walked
the
hungrier
he
naturally
became
short
of
trailing
home
there
were
only
two
places
where
he
could
grandfather
in
park
lane
and
timothy
in
the
bayswater
road
which
was
the
less
deplorable
at
his
grandfather
he
would
probably
get
a
better
dinner
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
at
timothy
they
gave
you
a
jolly
good
feed
when
they
expected
you
not
otherwise
he
decided
on
park
lane
not
unmoved
by
the
thought
that
to
go
up
to
oxford
without
affording
his
grandfather
a
chance
to
tip
him
was
hardly
fair
to
either
of
them
his
mother
would
hear
he
had
been
there
of
course
and
might
think
it
funny
but
he
could
help
that
he
rang
the
bell
hullo
warmson
any
dinner
for
me
think
they
just
going
in
master
val
forsyte
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
he
was
saying
at
lunch
that
he
never
saw
you
val
grinned
well
here
i
am
kill
the
fatted
calf
warmson
let
have
warmson
smiled
his
opinion
val
was
a
young
limb
i
will
ask
forsyte
master
i
say
val
grumbled
taking
off
his
overcoat
i
not
at
school
any
more
you
warmson
not
without
a
sense
of
humour
opened
the
door
beyond
the
coat
stand
with
the
words
mr
valerus
confound
him
thought
val
entering
a
warm
embrace
a
well
val
from
emily
and
a
rather
quavery
so
there
you
are
at
last
from
james
restored
his
sense
of
dignity
why
did
you
let
us
know
there
only
saddle
of
mutton
champagne
warmson
said
emily
and
they
went
in
at
the
great
shortened
to
its
utmost
under
which
so
many
fashionable
legs
had
rested
james
sat
at
one
end
emily
at
the
other
val
between
them
and
something
of
the
loneliness
of
his
grandparents
now
that
all
their
four
children
were
flown
reached
the
boy
spirit
hope
i
shall
kick
the
bucket
long
before
i
as
old
as
grandfather
he
thought
old
chap
he
as
thin
as
a
rail
and
lowering
his
voice
while
his
grandfather
and
warmson
were
in
discussion
about
sugar
in
the
soup
he
said
to
emily
it
pretty
brutal
at
home
granny
i
suppose
you
yes
dear
uncle
soames
was
there
when
i
left
i
say
is
there
anything
to
be
done
to
prevent
a
divorce
why
is
he
so
beastly
keen
on
it
hush
my
dear
murmured
emily
we
keeping
it
from
your
james
voice
sounded
from
the
other
end
what
that
what
are
you
talking
about
about
val
college
returned
emily
young
pariser
was
there
james
you
nearly
broke
the
bank
at
monte
carlo
james
muttered
that
he
did
not
must
look
after
himself
up
there
or
he
get
into
bad
ways
and
he
looked
at
his
grandson
with
gloom
out
of
which
affection
distrustfully
glimmered
what
i
afraid
of
said
val
to
his
plate
is
of
being
hard
up
you
by
instinct
he
knew
that
the
weak
spot
in
that
old
man
was
fear
of
insecurity
for
his
grandchildren
well
said
james
and
the
soup
in
his
spoon
dribbled
over
have
a
good
allowance
but
you
must
keep
within
of
course
murmured
val
if
it
is
good
how
much
will
it
be
grandfather
three
hundred
and
fifty
it
too
much
i
had
next
to
nothing
at
your
val
sighed
he
had
hoped
for
four
and
been
afraid
of
three
i
know
what
your
young
cousin
has
said
james
he
up
there
his
father
a
rich
are
you
asked
val
hardily
i
replied
james
flustered
i
got
so
many
expenses
your
father
and
he
was
silent
cousin
jolyon
got
an
awfully
jolly
place
i
went
down
there
with
uncle
ah
murmured
james
profoundly
that
knew
how
it
would
be
and
he
lapsed
into
gloomy
meditation
over
his
his
tragedy
and
the
deep
cleavage
it
had
caused
in
the
forsyte
family
had
still
the
power
to
draw
him
down
into
a
whirlpool
of
doubts
and
misgivings
val
who
hankered
to
talk
of
robin
hill
because
robin
hill
meant
holly
turned
to
emily
and
said
was
that
the
house
built
for
uncle
soames
and
receiving
her
nod
went
on
i
wish
you
tell
me
about
him
granny
what
became
of
aunt
irene
is
she
still
going
he
seems
awfully
about
something
emily
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
but
the
word
irene
had
caught
ear
what
that
he
said
staying
a
piece
of
mutton
close
to
his
lips
who
been
seeing
her
i
knew
we
had
heard
the
last
of
now
james
said
emily
eat
your
dinner
nobody
been
seeing
james
put
down
his
fork
there
you
go
he
said
i
might
die
before
you
tell
me
of
it
is
soames
getting
a
divorce
nonsense
said
emily
with
incomparable
aplomb
soames
is
much
too
james
had
sought
his
own
throat
gathering
the
long
white
whiskers
together
on
the
skin
and
bone
of
it
was
always
he
said
and
with
that
enigmatic
remark
the
conversation
lapsed
for
warmson
had
returned
but
later
when
the
saddle
of
mutton
had
been
succeeded
by
sweet
savoury
and
dessert
and
val
had
received
a
cheque
for
twenty
pounds
and
his
no
other
kiss
in
the
world
from
lips
pushed
out
with
a
sort
of
fearful
suddenness
as
if
yielding
to
returned
to
the
charge
in
the
hall
tell
us
about
uncle
soames
granny
why
is
he
so
keen
on
getting
a
divorce
your
uncle
soames
said
emily
and
her
voice
had
in
it
an
exaggerated
assurance
is
a
lawyer
my
dear
boy
he
sure
to
know
is
he
muttered
val
but
what
did
become
of
aunt
irene
i
remember
she
was
jolly
said
emily
behaved
very
badly
we
do
talk
about
well
i
do
want
everybody
at
oxford
to
know
about
our
affairs
ejaculated
val
it
a
brutal
idea
why
could
father
be
prevented
without
its
being
made
public
emily
sighed
she
had
always
lived
rather
in
an
atmosphere
of
divorce
owing
to
her
fashionable
many
of
those
whose
legs
had
been
under
her
table
having
gained
a
certain
notoriety
when
however
it
touched
her
own
family
she
liked
it
no
better
than
other
people
but
she
was
eminently
practical
and
a
woman
of
courage
who
never
pursued
a
shadow
in
preference
to
its
substance
your
mother
she
said
will
be
happier
if
she
quite
free
val
my
dear
boy
and
do
wear
loud
waistcoats
up
at
oxford
they
not
the
thing
just
now
here
a
little
with
another
five
pounds
in
his
hand
and
a
little
warmth
in
his
heart
for
he
was
fond
of
his
grandmother
he
went
out
into
park
lane
a
wind
had
cleared
the
mist
the
autumn
leaves
were
rustling
and
the
stars
were
shining
with
all
that
money
in
his
pocket
an
impulse
to
life
beset
him
but
he
had
not
gone
forty
yards
in
the
direction
of
piccadilly
when
holly
shy
face
and
her
eyes
with
an
imp
dancing
in
their
gravity
came
up
before
him
and
his
hand
seemed
to
be
tingling
again
from
the
pressure
of
her
warm
gloved
hand
dash
it
he
thought
going
home
chapter
entertains
the
future
it
was
full
late
for
the
river
but
the
weather
was
lovely
and
summer
lingered
below
the
yellowing
leaves
soames
took
many
looks
at
the
day
from
his
riverside
garden
near
mapledurham
that
sunday
morning
with
his
own
hands
he
put
flowers
about
his
little
and
equipped
the
punt
in
which
after
lunch
he
proposed
to
take
them
on
the
river
placing
those
cushions
he
could
not
tell
whether
or
no
he
wished
to
take
annette
alone
she
was
so
very
he
trust
himself
not
to
say
irrevocable
words
passing
beyond
the
limits
of
discretion
roses
on
the
veranda
were
still
in
bloom
and
the
hedges
so
that
there
was
almost
nothing
of
autumn
to
chill
the
mood
yet
was
he
nervous
fidgety
strangely
distrustful
of
his
powers
to
steer
just
the
right
course
this
visit
had
been
planned
to
produce
in
annette
and
her
mother
a
due
sense
of
his
possessions
so
that
they
should
be
ready
to
receive
with
respect
any
overture
he
might
later
be
disposed
to
make
he
dressed
with
great
care
making
himself
neither
too
young
nor
too
old
very
thankful
that
his
hair
was
still
thick
and
smooth
and
had
no
grey
in
it
three
times
he
went
up
to
his
if
they
had
any
knowledge
at
all
they
must
see
at
once
that
his
collection
alone
was
worth
at
least
thirty
thousand
pounds
he
minutely
inspected
too
the
pretty
bedroom
overlooking
the
river
where
they
would
take
off
their
hats
it
would
be
her
bedroom
the
matter
went
through
and
she
became
his
wife
going
up
to
the
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
pincushion
into
which
were
stuck
all
kinds
of
pins
a
bowl
of
exhaled
a
scent
that
made
his
head
turn
just
a
little
his
wife
if
only
the
whole
thing
could
be
settled
out
of
hand
and
there
was
not
the
nightmare
of
this
divorce
to
be
gone
through
first
and
with
gloom
puckered
on
his
forehead
he
looked
out
at
the
river
shining
beyond
the
roses
and
the
lawn
madame
lamotte
would
never
resist
this
prospect
for
her
child
annette
would
never
resist
her
mother
if
only
he
were
free
he
drove
to
the
station
to
meet
them
what
taste
frenchwomen
had
madame
lamotte
was
in
black
with
touches
of
lilac
colour
annette
in
greyish
lilac
linen
with
cream
coloured
gloves
and
hat
rather
pale
she
looked
and
londony
and
her
blue
eyes
were
demure
waiting
for
them
to
come
down
to
lunch
soames
stood
in
the
open
of
the
diningroom
moved
by
that
sensuous
delight
in
sunshine
and
flowers
and
trees
which
only
came
to
the
full
when
youth
and
beauty
were
there
to
share
it
with
one
he
had
ordered
the
lunch
with
intense
consideration
the
wine
was
a
very
special
sauterne
the
whole
appointments
of
the
meal
perfect
the
coffee
served
on
the
veranda
madame
lamotte
accepted
creme
de
menthe
annette
refused
her
manners
were
charming
with
just
a
suspicion
of
conscious
beauty
creeping
into
them
thought
soames
year
of
london
and
that
sort
of
life
and
she
be
spoiled
madame
was
in
sedate
french
raptures
adorable
le
soleil
est
si
bon
how
everything
is
chic
is
it
not
annette
monsieur
is
a
real
monte
annette
murmured
assent
with
a
look
up
at
soames
which
he
could
not
read
he
proposed
a
turn
on
the
river
but
to
punt
two
persons
when
one
of
them
looked
so
ravishing
on
those
chinese
cushions
was
merely
to
suffer
from
a
sense
of
lost
opportunity
so
they
went
but
a
short
way
towards
pangbourne
drifting
slowly
back
with
every
now
and
then
an
autumn
leaf
dropping
on
annette
or
on
her
black
amplitude
and
soames
was
not
happy
worried
by
the
thought
i
they
did
not
yet
even
know
that
he
was
married
to
tell
them
he
was
married
might
jeopardise
his
every
chance
yet
if
he
did
not
definitely
make
them
understand
that
he
wished
for
annette
hand
it
would
be
dropping
into
some
other
clutch
before
he
was
free
to
claim
it
at
tea
which
they
both
took
with
lemon
soames
spoke
of
the
transvaal
there
be
war
he
said
madame
lamotte
lamented
ces
pauvres
gens
bergers
could
they
not
be
left
to
themselves
soames
question
seemed
to
him
absurd
surely
as
a
woman
of
business
she
understood
that
the
british
could
not
abandon
their
legitimate
commercial
interests
ah
that
but
madame
lamotte
found
that
the
english
were
a
little
hypocrite
they
were
talking
of
justice
and
the
uitlanders
not
of
business
monsieur
was
the
first
who
had
spoken
to
her
of
that
the
boers
are
only
remarked
soames
they
stand
in
the
way
of
progress
it
will
never
do
to
let
our
suzerainty
what
does
that
mean
to
say
suzerainty
what
a
strange
word
soames
became
eloquent
roused
by
these
threats
to
the
principle
of
possession
and
stimulated
by
annette
eyes
fixed
on
him
he
was
delighted
when
presently
she
said
i
think
monsieur
is
right
they
should
be
taught
a
she
was
sensible
of
course
he
said
we
must
act
with
moderation
i
no
jingo
we
must
be
firm
without
bullying
will
you
come
up
and
see
my
pictures
moving
from
one
to
another
of
these
treasures
he
soon
perceived
that
they
knew
nothing
they
passed
his
last
mauve
that
remarkable
study
of
a
going
home
as
if
it
were
a
lithograph
he
waited
almost
with
awe
to
see
how
they
would
view
the
jewel
of
his
israels
whose
price
he
had
watched
ascending
till
he
was
now
almost
certain
it
had
reached
top
value
and
would
be
better
on
the
market
again
they
did
not
view
it
at
all
this
was
a
shock
and
yet
to
have
in
annette
a
virgin
taste
to
form
would
be
better
than
to
have
the
silly
predilections
of
the
english
to
deal
with
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
was
a
meissonier
of
which
he
was
rather
was
so
steadily
going
down
madame
lamotte
stopped
before
it
meissonier
ah
what
a
jewel
soames
took
advantage
of
that
moment
very
gently
touching
annette
arm
he
said
how
do
you
like
my
place
annette
she
did
not
shrink
did
not
respond
she
looked
at
him
full
looked
down
and
murmured
who
would
not
like
it
it
is
so
beautiful
perhaps
some
soames
said
and
stopped
so
pretty
she
was
so
frightened
him
those
eyes
the
turn
of
that
creamy
neck
her
delicate
was
a
standing
temptation
to
indiscretion
no
no
one
must
be
sure
of
one
surer
i
hold
off
he
thought
will
tantalise
her
and
he
crossed
over
to
madame
lamotte
who
was
still
in
front
of
the
meissonier
yes
that
quite
a
good
example
of
his
later
work
you
must
come
again
madame
and
see
them
lighted
up
you
must
both
come
and
spend
a
enchanted
would
it
not
be
beautiful
to
see
them
lighted
by
moonlight
too
the
river
must
be
ravishing
annette
murmured
thou
art
sentimental
maman
sentimental
that
comely
substantial
frenchwoman
of
the
world
and
suddenly
he
was
certain
as
he
could
be
that
there
was
no
sentiment
in
either
of
them
all
the
better
of
what
use
sentiment
and
yet
he
drove
to
the
station
with
them
and
saw
them
into
the
train
to
the
tightened
pressure
of
his
hand
it
seemed
that
annette
fingers
responded
just
a
little
her
face
smiled
at
him
through
the
dark
he
went
back
to
the
carriage
brooding
go
on
home
jordan
he
said
to
the
coachman
i
and
he
strode
out
into
the
darkening
lanes
caution
and
the
desire
of
possession
playing
within
him
soir
monsieur
how
softly
she
had
said
it
to
know
what
was
in
her
mind
the
were
like
could
tell
nothing
pretty
what
a
perfect
young
thing
to
hold
in
one
arms
what
a
mother
for
his
heir
and
he
thought
with
a
smile
of
his
family
and
their
surprise
at
a
french
wife
and
their
curiosity
and
of
the
way
he
would
play
with
it
and
buffet
it
confound
them
the
poplars
sighed
in
the
darkness
an
owl
hooted
shadows
deepened
in
the
water
will
and
must
be
free
he
thought
wo
hang
about
any
longer
i
go
and
see
irene
if
you
want
things
done
do
them
yourself
i
must
live
and
move
and
have
my
being
and
in
echo
to
that
queer
biblicality
chimed
the
call
to
evening
prayer
chapter
visits
the
past
on
a
tuesday
evening
after
dining
at
his
club
soames
set
out
to
do
what
required
more
courage
and
perhaps
less
delicacy
than
anything
he
had
yet
undertaken
in
his
perhaps
his
birth
and
one
other
action
he
chose
the
evening
indeed
partly
because
irene
was
more
likely
to
be
in
but
mainly
because
he
had
failed
to
find
sufficient
resolution
by
daylight
had
needed
wine
to
give
him
extra
daring
he
left
his
hansom
on
the
embankment
and
walked
up
to
the
old
church
uncertain
of
the
block
of
flats
where
he
knew
she
lived
he
found
it
hiding
behind
a
much
larger
mansion
and
having
read
the
name
irene
forsooth
her
maiden
name
so
she
used
that
again
did
she
stepped
back
into
the
road
to
look
up
at
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
light
was
coming
through
in
the
corner
flat
and
he
could
hear
a
piano
being
played
he
had
never
had
a
love
of
music
had
secretly
borne
it
a
grudge
in
the
old
days
when
so
often
she
had
turned
to
her
piano
making
of
it
a
refuge
place
into
which
she
knew
he
could
not
enter
repulse
the
long
repulse
at
first
restrained
and
secret
at
last
open
bitter
memory
came
with
that
sound
it
must
be
she
playing
and
thus
almost
assured
of
seeing
her
he
stood
more
undecided
than
ever
shivers
of
anticipation
ran
through
him
his
tongue
felt
dry
his
heart
beat
fast
have
no
cause
to
be
afraid
he
thought
and
then
the
lawyer
stirred
within
him
was
he
doing
a
foolish
thing
ought
he
not
to
have
arranged
a
formal
meeting
in
the
presence
of
her
trustee
no
not
before
that
fellow
jolyon
who
sympathised
with
her
never
he
crossed
back
into
the
doorway
and
slowly
to
keep
down
the
beating
of
his
heart
mounted
the
single
flight
of
stairs
and
rang
the
bell
when
the
door
was
opened
to
him
his
sensations
were
regulated
by
the
scent
which
away
back
in
the
past
bringing
muffled
remembrance
fragrance
of
a
he
used
to
enter
of
a
house
he
used
to
of
dried
and
honey
say
forsyte
he
said
your
mistress
will
see
me
i
he
had
thought
this
out
she
would
think
it
was
jolyon
when
the
maid
was
gone
and
he
was
alone
in
the
tiny
hall
where
the
light
was
dim
from
one
sconce
and
walls
carpet
everything
was
silvery
making
the
space
all
ghostly
he
could
only
think
ridiculously
i
go
in
with
my
overcoat
on
or
take
it
off
the
music
ceased
the
maid
said
from
the
doorway
will
you
walk
in
sir
soames
walked
in
he
noted
mechanically
that
all
was
still
silvery
and
that
the
upright
piano
was
of
satinwood
she
had
risen
and
stood
recoiled
against
it
her
hand
placed
on
the
keys
as
if
groping
for
support
had
struck
a
sudden
discord
held
for
a
moment
and
released
the
light
from
the
shaded
fell
on
her
neck
leaving
her
face
rather
in
shadow
she
was
in
a
black
evening
dress
with
a
sort
of
mantilla
over
her
did
not
remember
ever
having
seen
her
in
black
and
the
thought
passed
through
him
dresses
even
when
alone
you
he
heard
her
whisper
many
times
soames
had
rehearsed
this
scene
in
fancy
rehearsal
served
him
not
at
all
he
simply
could
not
speak
he
had
never
thought
that
the
sight
of
this
woman
whom
he
had
once
so
passionately
desired
so
completely
owned
and
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
twelve
years
could
affect
him
in
this
way
he
had
imagined
himself
speaking
and
acting
half
as
man
of
business
half
as
judge
and
now
it
was
as
if
he
were
in
the
presence
not
of
a
mere
woman
and
erring
wife
but
of
some
force
subtle
and
elusive
as
atmosphere
itself
within
him
and
outside
a
kind
of
defensive
irony
welled
up
in
him
yes
it
a
queer
visit
i
hope
you
thank
you
will
you
sit
down
she
had
moved
away
from
the
piano
and
gone
over
to
a
sinking
on
to
it
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
light
fell
on
her
there
so
that
soames
could
see
her
face
eyes
hair
strangely
as
he
remembered
them
strangely
beautiful
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
satinwood
chair
upholstered
with
stuff
close
to
where
he
was
standing
you
have
not
changed
he
said
no
what
have
you
come
for
to
discuss
i
have
heard
what
you
want
from
your
well
i
am
willing
i
have
always
the
sound
of
her
voice
reserved
and
close
the
sight
of
her
figure
watchfully
poised
defensive
was
helping
him
now
a
thousand
memories
of
her
ever
on
the
watch
against
him
stirred
and
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
then
to
give
me
information
on
which
i
can
act
the
law
must
be
complied
i
have
none
to
give
you
that
you
do
know
twelve
years
do
you
suppose
i
can
believe
that
i
do
suppose
you
will
believe
anything
i
say
but
it
the
soames
looked
at
her
hard
he
had
said
that
she
had
not
changed
now
he
perceived
that
she
had
not
in
face
except
that
it
was
more
beautiful
not
in
form
except
that
it
was
a
little
she
had
changed
spiritually
there
was
more
of
her
as
it
were
something
of
activity
and
daring
where
there
had
been
sheer
passive
resistance
he
thought
her
independent
income
confound
uncle
jolyon
i
suppose
you
comfortably
off
now
he
said
thank
you
why
did
you
let
me
provide
for
you
i
would
have
in
spite
of
a
faint
smile
came
on
her
lips
but
she
did
not
answer
you
are
still
my
wife
said
soames
why
he
said
that
what
he
meant
by
it
he
knew
neither
when
he
spoke
nor
after
it
was
a
truism
almost
preposterous
but
its
effect
was
startling
she
rose
from
the
and
stood
for
a
moment
perfectly
still
looking
at
him
he
could
see
her
bosom
heaving
then
she
turned
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
why
do
that
he
said
sharply
you
catch
cold
in
that
dress
not
and
he
uttered
a
little
sad
laugh
she
echoed
bitterly
it
rather
odd
habit
said
soames
as
bitterly
shut
the
window
she
shut
it
and
sat
down
again
she
had
developed
power
this
of
his
he
felt
it
issuing
from
her
as
she
sat
there
in
a
sort
of
armour
and
almost
unconsciously
he
rose
and
moved
nearer
he
wanted
to
see
the
expression
on
her
face
her
eyes
met
his
unflinching
heavens
how
clear
they
were
and
what
a
dark
brown
against
that
white
skin
and
that
hair
and
how
white
her
shoulders
funny
sensation
this
he
ought
to
hate
her
you
had
better
tell
me
he
said
it
to
your
advantage
to
be
free
as
well
as
to
mine
that
old
matter
is
too
i
have
told
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
has
been
nobody
you
must
go
to
your
own
stung
by
that
retort
soames
moved
towards
the
piano
and
back
to
the
hearth
to
and
fro
as
he
had
been
wont
in
the
old
days
in
their
when
his
feelings
were
too
much
for
him
that
wo
do
he
said
you
deserted
me
in
common
justice
it
for
you
he
saw
her
shrug
those
white
shoulders
heard
her
murmur
yes
why
did
you
divorce
me
then
should
i
have
cared
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
intently
with
a
sort
of
curiosity
what
on
earth
did
she
do
with
herself
if
she
really
lived
quite
alone
and
why
had
he
not
divorced
her
the
old
feeling
that
she
had
never
understood
him
never
done
him
justice
bit
him
while
he
stared
at
her
why
could
you
have
made
me
a
good
wife
he
said
yes
it
was
a
crime
to
marry
you
i
have
paid
for
it
you
will
find
some
way
perhaps
you
need
mind
my
name
i
have
none
to
lose
now
i
think
you
had
better
a
sense
of
being
defrauded
of
his
and
of
something
else
beyond
power
of
explanation
to
himself
beset
soames
like
the
breath
of
a
cold
fog
mechanically
he
reached
up
took
from
the
a
little
china
bowl
reversed
it
and
said
lowestoft
where
did
you
get
this
i
bought
its
fellow
at
and
visited
by
the
sudden
memory
of
how
those
many
years
ago
he
and
she
had
bought
china
together
he
remained
staring
at
the
little
bowl
as
if
it
contained
all
the
past
her
voice
roused
him
take
it
i
do
want
soames
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
will
you
shake
hands
he
said
a
faint
smile
curved
her
lips
she
held
out
her
hand
it
was
cold
to
his
rather
feverish
touch
made
of
ice
he
was
always
made
of
ice
but
even
as
that
thought
darted
through
him
his
senses
were
assailed
by
the
perfume
of
her
dress
and
body
as
though
the
warmth
within
her
which
had
never
been
for
him
were
struggling
to
show
its
presence
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
he
walked
out
and
away
as
if
someone
with
a
whip
were
after
him
not
even
looking
for
a
cab
glad
of
the
empty
embankment
and
the
cold
river
and
the
shadows
of
the
flurried
sore
at
heart
and
vaguely
disturbed
as
though
he
had
made
some
deep
mistake
whose
consequences
he
could
not
foresee
and
the
fantastic
thought
suddenly
assailed
him
if
instead
of
think
you
had
better
go
she
had
said
think
you
had
better
stay
what
should
he
have
felt
what
would
he
have
done
that
cursed
attraction
of
her
was
there
for
him
even
now
after
all
these
years
of
estrangement
and
bitter
thoughts
it
was
there
ready
to
mount
to
his
head
at
a
sign
a
touch
was
a
fool
to
go
he
muttered
advanced
nothing
who
could
imagine
i
never
thought
memory
flown
back
to
the
first
years
of
his
marriage
played
him
torturing
tricks
she
had
not
deserved
to
keep
her
beauty
he
had
owned
and
known
so
well
and
a
kind
of
bitterness
at
the
tenacity
of
his
own
admiration
welled
up
in
him
most
men
would
have
hated
the
sight
of
her
as
she
had
deserved
she
had
spoiled
his
life
wounded
his
pride
to
death
defrauded
him
of
a
son
and
yet
the
mere
sight
of
her
cold
and
resisting
as
ever
had
this
power
to
upset
him
utterly
it
was
some
damned
magnetism
she
had
and
no
wonder
if
as
she
asserted
she
had
lived
untouched
these
last
twelve
years
so
be
his
memory
lived
on
all
this
time
with
her
soames
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
glad
of
that
knowledge
or
no
nearing
his
club
at
last
he
stopped
to
buy
a
paper
a
headline
ran
reported
to
repudiate
suzerainty
suzerainty
like
her
he
thought
always
did
suzerainty
i
still
have
it
by
rights
she
must
be
awfully
lonely
in
that
wretched
little
flat
chapter
forsyte
soames
belonged
to
two
clubs
connoisseurs
which
he
put
on
his
cards
and
seldom
visited
and
remove
which
he
did
not
put
on
his
cards
and
frequented
he
had
joined
this
liberal
institution
five
years
ago
having
made
sure
that
its
members
were
now
nearly
all
sound
conservatives
in
heart
and
pocket
if
not
in
principle
uncle
nicholas
had
put
him
up
the
fine
was
decorated
in
the
adam
style
on
entering
that
evening
he
glanced
at
the
tape
for
any
news
about
the
transvaal
and
noted
that
consols
were
down
since
the
morning
he
was
turning
away
to
seek
the
when
a
voice
behind
him
said
well
soames
that
went
off
all
it
was
uncle
nicholas
in
a
and
his
special
collar
with
a
black
tie
passed
through
a
ring
heavens
how
young
and
dapper
he
looked
at
i
think
roger
have
been
pleased
his
uncle
went
on
the
thing
was
very
well
done
blackley
i
make
a
note
of
them
buxton
done
me
no
good
these
boers
are
upsetting
fellow
chamberlain
driving
the
country
into
war
what
do
you
think
bound
to
come
murmured
soames
nicholas
passed
his
hand
over
his
thin
cheeks
very
rosy
after
his
summer
cure
a
slight
pout
had
gathered
on
his
lips
this
business
had
revived
all
his
liberal
principles
i
mistrust
that
chap
he
a
stormy
petrel
will
go
down
if
there
war
you
have
trouble
with
roger
estate
i
often
told
him
he
ought
to
get
out
of
some
of
his
houses
he
was
an
opinionated
was
a
pair
of
you
thought
soames
but
he
never
argued
with
an
uncle
in
that
way
preserving
their
opinion
of
him
as
chap
and
the
legal
care
of
their
property
they
tell
me
at
timothy
said
nicholas
lowering
his
voice
that
dartie
has
gone
off
at
last
that
be
a
relief
to
your
father
he
was
a
rotten
again
soames
nodded
if
there
was
a
subject
on
which
the
forsytes
really
agreed
it
was
the
character
of
montague
dartie
you
take
care
said
nicholas
or
he
turn
up
again
winifred
had
better
have
the
tooth
out
i
should
say
no
use
preserving
what
gone
soames
looked
at
him
sideways
his
nerves
exacerbated
by
the
interview
he
had
just
come
through
disposed
him
to
see
a
personal
allusion
in
those
words
i
advising
her
he
said
shortly
well
said
nicholas
the
brougham
waiting
i
must
get
home
very
poorly
remember
me
to
your
and
having
thus
reconsecrated
the
ties
of
blood
he
passed
down
the
steps
at
his
youthful
gait
and
was
wrapped
into
his
fur
coat
by
the
junior
porter
i
never
known
uncle
nicholas
other
than
very
poorly
mused
soames
or
seen
him
look
other
than
everlasting
what
a
family
judging
by
him
i
got
years
of
health
before
me
well
i
not
going
to
waste
them
and
going
over
to
a
mirror
he
stood
looking
at
his
face
except
for
a
line
or
two
and
three
or
four
grey
hairs
in
his
little
dark
moustache
had
he
aged
any
more
than
irene
the
prime
of
and
she
in
the
very
prime
of
life
and
a
fantastic
thought
shot
into
his
mind
absurd
idiotic
but
again
it
came
and
genuinely
alarmed
by
the
recurrence
as
one
is
by
the
second
fit
of
shivering
which
presages
a
feverish
cold
he
sat
down
on
the
weighing
machine
eleven
stone
he
had
not
varied
two
pounds
in
twenty
years
what
age
was
she
nearly
too
old
to
have
a
at
all
on
the
ninth
of
next
month
he
remembered
her
birthday
had
always
observed
it
religiously
even
that
last
birthday
so
soon
before
she
left
him
when
he
was
almost
certain
she
was
faithless
four
birthdays
in
his
house
he
had
looked
forward
to
them
because
his
gifts
had
meant
a
semblance
of
gratitude
a
certain
attempt
at
warmth
except
indeed
that
last
had
tempted
him
to
be
too
religious
and
he
shied
away
in
thought
memory
heaps
dead
leaves
on
deeds
from
under
which
they
do
but
vaguely
offend
the
sense
and
then
he
thought
suddenly
could
send
her
a
present
for
her
birthday
after
all
we
christians
could
we
join
up
again
and
he
uttered
a
deep
sigh
sitting
there
annette
ah
but
between
him
and
annette
was
the
need
for
that
wretched
divorce
suit
and
how
a
man
can
always
work
these
things
if
he
take
it
on
himself
jolyon
had
said
but
why
should
he
take
the
scandal
on
himself
with
his
whole
career
as
a
pillar
of
the
law
at
stake
it
was
not
fair
it
was
quixotic
twelve
years
separation
in
which
he
had
taken
no
steps
to
free
himself
put
out
of
court
the
possibility
of
using
her
conduct
with
bosinney
as
a
ground
for
divorcing
her
by
doing
nothing
to
secure
relief
he
had
acquiesced
even
if
the
evidence
could
now
be
gathered
which
was
more
than
doubtful
besides
his
own
pride
would
never
let
him
use
that
old
incident
he
had
suffered
from
it
too
much
no
nothing
but
fresh
misconduct
on
her
she
had
denied
it
had
believed
her
hung
up
utterly
hung
up
he
rose
from
the
red
velvet
seat
with
a
feeling
of
constriction
about
his
vitals
he
would
never
sleep
with
this
going
on
in
him
and
taking
coat
and
hat
again
he
went
out
moving
eastward
in
trafalgar
square
he
became
aware
of
some
special
commotion
travelling
towards
him
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
strand
it
materialised
in
newspaper
men
calling
out
so
loudly
that
no
words
whatever
could
be
heard
he
stopped
to
listen
and
one
came
by
payper
special
ultimatium
by
krooger
declaration
of
war
soames
bought
the
paper
there
it
was
in
the
stop
press
his
first
thought
was
boers
are
committing
suicide
his
second
there
anything
still
i
ought
to
sell
if
so
he
had
missed
the
would
certainly
be
a
slump
in
the
city
he
swallowed
this
thought
with
a
nod
of
defiance
that
ultimatum
was
than
let
it
pass
he
was
prepared
to
lose
money
they
wanted
a
lesson
and
they
would
get
it
but
it
would
take
three
months
at
least
to
bring
them
to
heel
there
were
the
troops
out
there
always
behind
time
the
government
confound
those
newspaper
rats
what
was
the
use
of
waking
everybody
up
breakfast
was
quite
soon
enough
and
he
thought
with
alarm
of
his
father
they
would
cry
it
down
park
lane
hailing
a
hansom
he
got
in
and
told
the
man
to
drive
there
james
and
emily
had
just
gone
up
to
bed
and
after
communicating
the
news
to
warmson
soames
prepared
to
follow
he
paused
by
to
say
what
do
you
think
of
it
warmson
the
butler
ceased
passing
a
hat
brush
over
the
silk
hat
soames
had
taken
off
and
inclining
his
face
a
little
forward
said
in
a
low
voice
well
sir
they
a
chance
of
course
but
i
told
they
very
good
shots
i
got
a
son
in
the
you
warmson
why
i
did
know
you
were
no
sir
i
do
talk
of
it
i
expect
he
be
going
the
slighter
shock
soames
had
felt
on
discovering
that
he
knew
so
little
of
one
whom
he
thought
he
knew
so
well
was
lost
in
the
slight
shock
of
discovering
that
the
war
might
touch
one
personally
born
in
the
year
of
the
crimean
war
he
had
only
come
to
consciousness
by
the
time
the
indian
mutiny
was
over
since
then
the
many
little
wars
of
the
british
empire
had
been
entirely
professional
quite
unconnected
with
the
forsytes
and
all
they
stood
for
in
the
body
politic
this
war
would
surely
be
no
exception
but
his
mind
ran
hastily
over
his
family
two
of
the
haymans
he
had
heard
were
in
some
yeomanry
or
had
always
been
a
pleasant
thought
there
was
a
certain
distinction
about
the
yeomanry
they
wore
or
used
to
wear
a
blue
uniform
with
silver
about
it
and
rode
horses
and
archibald
he
remembered
had
once
on
a
time
joined
the
militia
but
had
given
it
up
because
his
father
nicholas
had
made
such
a
fuss
about
his
his
time
peacocking
about
in
a
uniform
recently
he
had
heard
somewhere
that
young
nicholas
eldest
very
young
nicholas
had
become
a
volunteer
thought
soames
mounting
the
stairs
slowly
nothing
in
that
he
stood
on
the
landing
outside
his
parents
bed
and
dressing
rooms
debating
whether
or
not
to
put
his
nose
in
and
say
a
reassuring
word
opening
the
landing
window
he
listened
the
rumble
from
piccadilly
was
all
the
sound
he
heard
and
with
the
thought
these
increase
it
affect
house
property
he
was
about
to
pass
on
up
to
the
room
always
kept
ready
for
him
when
he
heard
distant
as
yet
the
hoarse
rushing
call
of
a
newsvendor
there
it
was
and
coming
past
the
house
he
knocked
on
his
mother
door
and
went
in
his
father
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
his
ears
pricked
under
the
white
hair
which
emily
kept
so
beautifully
cut
he
looked
pink
and
extraordinarily
clean
in
his
setting
of
white
sheet
and
pillow
out
of
which
the
points
of
his
high
thin
nightgowned
shoulders
emerged
in
small
peaks
his
eyes
alone
grey
and
distrustful
under
their
withered
lids
were
moving
from
the
window
to
emily
who
in
a
wrapper
was
walking
up
and
down
squeezing
a
rubber
ball
attached
to
a
scent
bottle
the
room
reeked
faintly
of
the
she
was
spraying
all
right
said
soames
it
not
a
fire
the
boers
have
declared
emily
stopped
her
spraying
oh
was
all
she
said
and
looked
at
james
soames
too
looked
at
his
father
he
was
taking
it
differently
from
their
expectation
as
if
some
thought
strange
to
them
were
working
in
him
h
he
muttered
suddenly
i
sha
live
to
see
the
end
of
nonsense
james
it
be
over
by
what
do
you
know
about
it
james
answered
her
with
asperity
it
a
pretty
mess
at
this
time
of
night
too
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
his
wife
and
son
as
if
hypnotised
waited
for
him
to
say
ca
do
know
i
knew
how
it
would
be
but
he
did
not
the
grey
eyes
shifted
evidently
seeing
nothing
in
the
room
then
movement
occurred
under
the
bedclothes
and
the
knees
were
drawn
up
suddenly
to
a
great
height
they
ought
to
send
out
roberts
it
all
comes
from
that
fellow
gladstone
and
his
the
two
listeners
noted
something
beyond
the
usual
in
his
voice
something
of
real
anxiety
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
shall
never
see
the
old
country
peaceful
and
safe
again
i
shall
have
to
die
before
i
know
she
won
and
in
spite
of
the
feeling
that
james
must
not
be
encouraged
to
be
fussy
they
were
touched
soames
went
up
to
the
bedside
and
stroked
his
father
hand
which
had
emerged
from
under
the
bedclothes
long
and
wrinkled
with
veins
mark
my
words
said
james
consols
will
go
to
par
for
all
i
know
val
may
go
and
oh
come
james
cried
emily
you
talk
as
if
there
were
her
comfortable
voice
seemed
to
soothe
james
for
once
well
he
muttered
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
i
do
know
tells
me
anything
are
you
sleeping
here
my
boy
the
crisis
was
past
he
would
now
compose
himself
to
his
normal
degree
of
anxiety
and
assuring
his
father
that
he
was
sleeping
in
the
house
soames
pressed
his
hand
and
went
up
to
his
room
the
following
afternoon
witnessed
the
greatest
crowd
timothy
had
known
for
many
a
year
on
national
occasions
such
as
this
it
was
indeed
almost
impossible
to
avoid
going
there
not
that
there
was
any
danger
or
rather
only
just
enough
to
make
it
necessary
to
assure
each
other
that
there
was
none
nicholas
was
there
early
he
had
seen
soames
the
night
had
said
it
was
bound
to
come
this
old
kruger
was
in
his
he
must
be
if
he
was
a
day
nicholas
was
what
had
timothy
said
he
had
had
a
fit
after
majuba
these
boers
were
a
grasping
lot
the
francie
who
had
arrived
on
his
heels
with
the
contradictious
touch
which
became
the
free
spirit
of
a
daughter
of
roger
chimed
in
kettle
and
pot
uncle
nicholas
what
price
the
uitlanders
what
price
indeed
a
new
expression
and
believed
to
be
due
to
her
brother
george
aunt
juley
thought
francie
ought
not
to
say
such
a
thing
dear
macander
boy
charlie
macander
was
one
and
no
one
could
call
him
grasping
at
this
francie
uttered
one
of
her
mots
scandalising
and
so
frequently
repeated
well
his
father
a
scotchman
and
his
mother
a
aunt
juley
covered
her
ears
too
late
but
aunt
hester
smiled
as
for
nicholas
he
of
which
he
was
not
the
author
was
hardly
to
his
taste
just
then
marian
tweetyman
arrived
followed
almost
immediately
by
young
nicholas
on
seeing
his
son
nicholas
rose
well
i
must
be
going
he
said
nick
here
will
tell
you
win
the
and
with
this
hit
at
his
eldest
who
as
a
pillar
of
accountancy
and
director
of
an
insurance
company
was
no
more
addicted
to
sport
than
his
father
had
ever
been
he
departed
dear
nicholas
what
race
was
that
or
was
it
only
one
of
his
jokes
he
was
a
wonderful
man
for
his
age
how
many
lumps
would
dear
marian
take
and
how
were
giles
and
jesse
aunt
juley
supposed
their
yeomanry
would
be
very
busy
now
guarding
the
coast
though
of
course
the
boers
had
no
ships
but
one
never
knew
what
the
french
might
do
if
they
had
the
chance
especially
since
that
dreadful
fashoda
scare
which
had
upset
timothy
so
terribly
that
he
had
made
no
investments
for
months
afterwards
it
was
the
ingratitude
of
the
boers
that
was
so
dreadful
after
everything
had
been
done
for
jameson
imprisoned
and
he
was
so
nice
macander
had
always
said
and
sir
alfred
milner
sent
out
to
talk
to
a
clever
man
she
did
know
what
they
wanted
but
at
this
moment
occurred
one
of
those
precious
at
great
occasions
sometimes
bring
forth
miss
june
aunts
juley
and
hester
were
on
their
feet
at
once
trembling
from
smothered
resentment
and
old
affection
bubbling
up
and
pride
at
the
return
of
a
prodigal
june
well
this
was
a
surprise
dear
all
these
years
and
how
well
she
was
looking
not
changed
at
all
it
was
almost
on
their
lips
to
add
how
is
your
dear
grandfather
forgetting
in
that
giddy
moment
that
poor
dear
jolyon
had
been
in
his
grave
for
seven
years
now
ever
the
most
courageous
and
downright
of
all
the
forsytes
june
with
her
decided
chin
and
her
spirited
eyes
and
her
hair
like
flame
sat
down
slight
and
short
on
a
gilt
chair
with
a
seat
for
all
the
world
as
if
ten
years
had
not
elapsed
since
she
had
been
to
see
years
of
travel
and
independence
and
devotion
to
lame
ducks
those
ducks
of
late
had
been
all
definitely
painters
etchers
or
sculptors
so
that
her
impatience
with
the
forsytes
and
their
hopelessly
inartistic
outlook
had
become
intense
indeed
she
had
almost
ceased
to
believe
that
her
family
existed
and
looked
round
her
now
with
a
sort
of
challenging
directness
which
brought
exquisite
discomfort
to
the
roomful
she
had
not
expected
to
meet
any
of
them
but
poor
old
things
and
why
she
had
come
to
see
them
she
hardly
knew
except
that
while
on
her
way
from
oxford
street
to
a
studio
in
latimer
road
she
had
suddenly
remembered
them
with
compunction
as
two
old
lame
ducks
aunt
juley
broke
the
hush
again
we
just
been
saying
dear
how
dreadful
it
is
about
these
boers
and
what
an
impudent
thing
of
that
old
kruger
impudent
said
june
i
think
he
quite
right
what
business
have
we
to
meddle
with
them
if
he
turned
out
all
those
wretched
uitlanders
it
would
serve
them
right
they
only
after
the
silence
of
sensation
was
broken
by
francie
saying
what
are
you
a
undoubtedly
the
first
use
of
that
expression
well
why
ca
we
leave
them
alone
said
june
just
as
in
the
open
doorway
the
maid
said
mr
soames
sensation
on
sensation
greeting
was
almost
held
up
by
curiosity
to
see
how
june
and
he
would
take
this
encounter
for
it
was
shrewdly
suspected
if
not
quite
known
that
they
had
not
met
since
that
old
and
lamentable
affair
of
her
fiance
bosinney
with
soames
wife
they
were
seen
to
just
touch
each
hands
and
look
each
at
the
other
left
eye
only
aunt
juley
came
at
once
to
the
rescue
dear
june
is
so
original
fancy
soames
she
thinks
the
boers
are
not
to
they
only
want
their
independence
said
june
and
why
should
they
have
it
because
answered
soames
with
his
smile
a
little
on
one
side
they
happen
to
have
agreed
to
our
suzerainty
repeated
june
scornfully
we
should
like
suzerainty
over
they
got
advantages
in
payment
replied
soames
a
contract
is
a
contracts
are
not
always
just
fumed
out
june
and
when
they
not
they
ought
to
be
broken
the
boers
are
much
the
weaker
we
could
afford
to
be
soames
sniffed
that
mere
sentiment
he
said
aunt
hester
to
whom
nothing
was
more
awful
than
any
kind
of
disagreement
here
leaned
forward
and
remarked
decisively
what
lovely
weather
it
has
been
for
the
time
of
year
but
june
was
not
to
be
diverted
i
do
know
why
sentiment
should
be
sneered
at
it
the
best
thing
in
the
she
looked
defiantly
round
and
aunt
juley
had
to
intervene
again
have
you
bought
any
pictures
lately
soames
her
incomparable
instinct
for
the
wrong
subject
had
not
failed
her
soames
flushed
to
disclose
the
name
of
his
latest
purchases
would
be
like
walking
into
the
jaws
of
disdain
for
somehow
they
all
knew
of
june
predilection
for
not
yet
on
its
legs
and
her
contempt
for
unless
she
had
had
a
finger
in
securing
it
one
or
two
he
muttered
but
june
face
had
changed
the
forsyte
within
her
was
seeing
its
chance
why
should
not
soames
buy
some
of
the
pictures
of
eric
last
lame
duck
and
she
promptly
opened
her
attack
did
soames
know
his
work
it
was
so
wonderful
he
was
the
coming
man
oh
yes
soames
knew
his
work
it
was
in
his
view
and
would
never
get
hold
of
the
public
june
blazed
up
of
course
it
wo
that
the
last
thing
one
would
wish
for
i
thought
you
were
a
connoisseur
not
a
of
course
soames
is
a
connoisseur
aunt
juley
said
hastily
he
has
wonderful
can
always
tell
beforehand
what
going
to
be
oh
gasped
june
and
sprang
up
from
the
chair
i
hate
that
standard
of
success
why
ca
people
buy
things
because
they
like
them
you
mean
said
francie
because
you
like
and
in
the
slight
pause
young
nicholas
was
heard
saying
gently
that
violet
his
fourth
was
taking
lessons
in
pastel
he
did
know
if
they
were
any
use
well
auntie
said
june
i
must
get
on
and
kissing
her
aunts
she
looked
defiantly
round
the
room
said
again
and
went
a
breeze
seemed
to
pass
out
with
her
as
if
everyone
had
sighed
the
third
sensation
came
before
anyone
had
time
to
speak
mr
james
james
came
in
using
a
stick
slightly
and
wrapped
in
a
fur
coat
which
gave
him
a
fictitious
bulk
everyone
stood
up
james
was
so
old
and
he
had
not
been
at
for
nearly
two
years
it
hot
in
here
he
said
soames
divested
him
of
his
coat
and
as
he
did
so
could
not
help
admiring
the
glossy
way
his
father
was
turned
out
james
sat
down
all
knees
elbows
and
long
white
whiskers
what
the
meaning
of
that
he
said
though
there
was
no
apparent
sense
in
his
words
they
all
knew
that
he
was
referring
to
june
his
eyes
searched
his
son
face
i
thought
i
come
and
see
for
myself
what
have
they
answered
kruger
soames
took
out
an
evening
paper
and
read
the
headline
action
by
our
of
war
existing
ah
said
james
and
sighed
i
was
afraid
they
cut
and
run
like
old
gladstone
we
shall
finish
with
them
this
all
stared
at
him
james
always
fussy
nervous
anxious
james
with
his
continual
told
you
how
it
would
be
and
his
pessimism
and
his
cautious
investments
there
was
something
uncanny
about
such
resolution
in
this
the
oldest
living
forsyte
where
timothy
said
james
he
ought
to
pay
attention
to
aunt
juley
said
she
did
know
timothy
had
not
said
much
at
lunch
aunt
hester
rose
and
threaded
her
way
out
of
the
room
and
francie
said
rather
maliciously
the
boers
are
a
hard
nut
to
crack
uncle
h
muttered
james
where
do
you
get
your
information
nobody
tells
young
nicholas
remarked
in
his
mild
voice
that
nick
his
eldest
was
now
going
to
drill
regularly
ah
muttered
james
and
stared
before
thoughts
were
on
val
he
got
to
look
after
his
mother
he
said
he
got
no
time
for
drilling
and
that
with
that
father
of
this
cryptic
saying
produced
silence
until
he
spoke
again
what
did
june
want
here
and
his
eyes
rested
with
suspicion
on
all
of
them
in
turn
her
father
a
rich
man
the
conversation
turned
on
jolyon
and
when
he
had
been
seen
last
it
was
supposed
that
he
went
abroad
and
saw
all
sorts
of
people
now
that
his
wife
was
dead
his
were
on
the
line
and
he
was
a
successful
man
francie
went
so
far
as
to
say
i
should
like
to
see
him
again
he
was
rather
a
aunt
juley
recalled
how
he
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
one
day
where
james
was
sitting
he
had
always
been
very
amiable
what
did
soames
think
knowing
that
jolyon
was
irene
trustee
all
felt
the
delicacy
of
this
question
and
looked
at
soames
with
interest
a
faint
pink
had
come
up
in
his
cheeks
he
going
grey
he
said
indeed
had
soames
seen
him
soames
nodded
and
the
pink
vanished
james
said
suddenly
do
know
i
ca
it
so
exactly
expressed
the
sentiment
of
everybody
present
that
there
was
something
behind
everything
that
nobody
responded
but
at
this
moment
aunt
hester
returned
timothy
she
said
in
a
low
voice
timothy
has
bought
a
map
and
put
put
in
three
timothy
had
a
sigh
went
round
the
company
if
timothy
had
indeed
put
in
three
flags
already
well
showed
what
the
nation
could
do
when
it
was
roused
the
war
was
as
good
as
over
chapter
finds
out
where
he
is
jolyon
stood
at
the
window
in
holly
old
night
nursery
converted
into
a
studio
not
because
it
had
a
north
light
but
for
its
view
over
the
prospect
away
to
the
grand
stand
at
epsom
he
shifted
to
the
side
window
which
overlooked
the
stableyard
and
whistled
down
to
the
dog
balthasar
who
lay
for
ever
under
the
clock
tower
the
old
dog
looked
up
and
wagged
his
tail
old
boy
thought
jolyon
shifting
back
to
the
other
window
he
had
been
restless
all
this
week
since
his
attempt
to
prosecute
trusteeship
uneasy
in
his
conscience
which
was
ever
acute
disturbed
in
his
sense
of
compassion
which
was
easily
excited
and
with
a
queer
sensation
as
if
his
feeling
for
beauty
had
received
some
definite
embodiment
autumn
was
getting
hold
of
the
old
its
leaves
were
browning
sunshine
had
been
plentiful
and
hot
this
summer
as
with
trees
so
with
men
lives
ought
to
live
long
thought
jolyon
getting
mildewed
for
want
of
heat
if
i
ca
work
i
shall
be
off
to
paris
but
memory
of
paris
gave
him
no
pleasure
besides
how
could
he
go
he
must
stay
and
see
what
soames
was
going
to
do
her
trustee
i
ca
leave
her
unprotected
he
thought
it
had
been
striking
him
as
curious
how
very
clearly
he
could
still
see
irene
in
her
little
which
he
had
only
twice
entered
her
beauty
must
have
a
sort
of
poignant
harmony
no
literal
portrait
would
ever
do
her
justice
the
essence
of
her
i
what
the
noise
of
hoofs
called
him
back
to
the
other
window
holly
was
riding
into
the
yard
on
her
she
looked
up
and
he
waved
to
her
she
had
been
rather
silent
lately
getting
old
he
supposed
beginning
to
want
her
future
as
they
all
time
was
certainly
the
devil
and
with
the
feeling
that
to
waste
this
commodity
was
unforgivable
folly
he
took
up
his
brush
but
it
was
no
use
he
could
not
concentrate
his
the
light
was
going
go
up
to
town
he
thought
in
the
hall
a
servant
met
him
a
lady
to
see
you
sir
extraordinary
coincidence
passing
into
the
as
it
was
still
called
he
saw
irene
standing
over
by
the
window
she
came
towards
him
saying
i
been
trespassing
i
came
up
through
the
coppice
and
garden
i
always
used
to
come
that
way
to
see
uncle
you
could
trespass
here
replied
jolyon
history
makes
that
impossible
i
was
just
thinking
of
irene
smiled
and
it
was
as
if
something
shone
through
not
mere
completer
more
alluring
history
she
answered
i
once
told
uncle
jolyon
that
love
was
for
ever
well
it
is
only
aversion
jolyon
stared
at
her
had
she
got
over
bosinney
at
last
yes
he
said
aversion
deeper
than
love
or
hate
because
it
a
natural
product
of
the
nerves
and
we
do
change
i
came
to
tell
you
that
soames
has
been
to
see
me
he
said
a
thing
that
frightened
me
he
said
are
still
my
wife
what
ejaculated
jolyon
you
ought
not
to
live
and
he
continued
to
stare
at
her
afflicted
by
the
thought
that
where
beauty
was
nothing
ever
ran
quite
straight
which
no
doubt
was
why
so
many
people
looked
on
it
as
immoral
what
more
he
asked
me
to
shake
hands
did
you
yes
when
he
came
in
i
sure
he
did
want
to
he
changed
while
he
was
ah
you
certainly
ought
not
to
go
on
living
there
i
know
no
woman
i
could
ask
and
i
ca
take
a
lover
to
order
cousin
heaven
forbid
said
jolyon
what
a
damnable
position
will
you
stay
to
dinner
no
well
let
me
see
you
back
to
town
i
wanted
to
go
up
this
truly
truly
i
be
ready
in
five
on
that
walk
to
the
station
they
talked
of
pictures
and
music
contrasting
the
english
and
french
characters
and
the
difference
in
their
attitude
to
art
but
to
jolyon
the
colours
in
the
hedges
of
the
long
straight
lane
the
twittering
of
chaffinches
who
kept
pace
with
them
the
perfume
of
weeds
being
already
burned
the
turn
of
her
neck
the
fascination
of
those
dark
eyes
bent
on
him
now
and
then
the
lure
of
her
whole
figure
made
a
deeper
impression
than
the
remarks
they
exchanged
unconsciously
he
held
himself
straighter
walked
with
a
more
elastic
step
in
the
train
he
put
her
through
a
sort
of
catechism
as
to
what
she
did
with
her
days
made
her
dresses
shopped
visited
a
hospital
played
her
piano
translated
from
the
french
she
had
regular
work
from
a
publisher
it
seemed
which
supplemented
her
income
a
little
she
seldom
went
out
in
the
evening
i
been
living
alone
so
long
you
see
that
i
do
mind
it
a
bit
i
believe
naturally
i
do
believe
that
said
jolyon
do
you
know
many
people
very
at
waterloo
they
took
a
hansom
and
he
drove
with
her
to
the
door
of
her
mansions
squeezing
her
hand
at
parting
he
said
you
know
you
could
always
come
to
us
at
robin
hill
you
must
let
me
know
everything
that
happens
she
answered
softly
jolyon
climbed
back
into
his
cab
wondering
why
he
had
not
asked
her
to
dine
and
go
to
the
theatre
with
him
solitary
starved
life
that
she
had
hotch
potch
club
he
said
through
the
as
his
hansom
debouched
on
to
the
embankment
a
man
in
and
overcoat
passed
walking
quickly
so
close
to
the
wall
that
he
seemed
to
be
scraping
it
jove
thought
jolyon
himself
what
he
up
to
now
and
stopping
the
cab
round
the
corner
he
got
out
and
retraced
his
steps
to
where
he
could
see
the
entrance
to
the
mansions
soames
had
halted
in
front
of
them
and
was
looking
up
at
the
light
in
her
windows
he
goes
in
thought
jolyon
shall
i
do
what
have
i
the
right
to
do
what
the
fellow
had
said
was
true
she
was
still
his
wife
absolutely
without
protection
from
annoyance
if
he
goes
in
he
thought
follow
and
he
began
moving
towards
the
mansions
again
soames
advanced
he
was
in
the
very
entrance
now
but
suddenly
he
stopped
spun
round
on
his
heel
and
came
back
towards
the
river
now
thought
jolyon
a
dozen
steps
he
recognise
me
and
he
turned
tail
his
cousin
footsteps
kept
pace
with
his
own
but
he
reached
his
cab
and
got
in
before
soames
had
turned
the
corner
go
on
he
said
through
the
trap
soames
figure
ranged
up
alongside
hansom
he
said
engaged
hallo
hallo
answered
jolyon
you
the
quick
suspicion
on
his
cousin
face
white
in
the
lamplight
decided
him
i
can
give
you
a
lift
he
said
if
you
going
thanks
answered
soames
and
got
in
i
been
seeing
irene
said
jolyon
when
the
cab
had
started
indeed
you
went
to
see
her
yesterday
yourself
i
i
did
said
soames
she
my
wife
you
the
tone
the
sneering
lip
roused
sudden
anger
in
jolyon
but
he
subdued
it
you
ought
to
know
best
he
said
but
if
you
want
a
divorce
it
not
very
wise
to
go
seeing
her
is
it
one
ca
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
you
very
good
to
warn
me
said
soames
but
i
have
not
made
up
my
she
has
said
jolyon
looking
straight
before
him
you
ca
take
things
up
you
know
as
they
were
twelve
years
that
remains
to
be
look
here
said
jolyon
she
in
a
damnable
position
and
i
am
the
only
person
with
any
legal
say
in
her
except
myself
retorted
soames
who
am
also
in
a
damnable
position
hers
is
what
she
made
for
herself
mine
what
she
made
for
me
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
in
her
own
interests
i
sha
require
her
to
return
to
what
exclaimed
jolyon
and
a
shiver
went
through
his
whole
body
i
do
know
what
you
may
mean
by
answered
soames
coldly
your
say
in
her
affairs
is
confined
to
paying
out
her
income
please
bear
that
in
mind
in
choosing
not
to
disgrace
her
by
a
divorce
i
retained
my
rights
and
as
i
say
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
require
to
exercise
my
god
ejaculated
jolyon
and
he
uttered
a
short
laugh
yes
said
soames
and
there
was
a
deadly
quality
in
his
voice
not
forgotten
the
nickname
your
father
gave
me
man
of
property
i
not
called
names
for
this
is
fantastic
murmured
jolyon
well
the
fellow
could
force
his
wife
to
live
with
him
those
days
were
past
anyway
and
he
looked
around
at
soames
with
the
thought
he
real
this
man
but
soames
looked
very
real
sitting
square
yet
almost
elegant
with
the
clipped
moustache
on
his
pale
face
and
a
tooth
showing
where
a
lip
was
lifted
in
a
fixed
smile
there
was
a
long
silence
while
jolyon
thought
of
helping
her
i
made
things
worse
suddenly
soames
said
it
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
her
in
many
at
those
words
such
a
turmoil
began
taking
place
in
jolyon
that
he
could
barely
sit
still
in
the
cab
it
was
as
if
he
were
boxed
up
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
his
countrymen
boxed
up
with
that
something
in
the
national
character
which
had
always
been
to
him
revolting
something
which
he
knew
to
be
extremely
natural
and
yet
which
seemed
to
him
intense
belief
in
contracts
and
vested
rights
their
complacent
sense
of
virtue
in
the
exaction
of
those
rights
here
beside
him
in
the
cab
was
the
very
embodiment
the
corporeal
sum
as
it
were
of
the
possessive
own
kinsman
too
it
was
uncanny
and
intolerable
there
something
more
in
it
than
that
he
thought
with
a
sick
feeling
dog
they
say
returns
to
his
vomit
the
sight
of
her
has
reawakened
something
beauty
the
devil
in
it
as
i
say
said
soames
i
have
not
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
kindly
leave
her
quite
jolyon
bit
his
lips
he
who
had
always
hated
rows
almost
welcomed
the
thought
of
one
now
i
can
give
you
no
such
promise
he
said
shortly
very
well
said
soames
then
we
know
where
we
are
i
get
down
and
stopping
the
cab
he
got
out
without
word
or
sign
of
farewell
jolyon
travelled
on
to
his
club
the
first
news
of
the
war
was
being
called
in
the
streets
but
he
paid
no
attention
what
could
he
do
to
help
her
if
only
his
father
were
alive
he
could
have
done
so
much
but
why
could
he
not
do
all
that
his
father
could
have
done
was
he
not
old
enough
fifty
and
twice
married
with
daughters
and
a
son
he
thought
she
were
plain
i
should
be
thinking
twice
about
it
beauty
is
the
devil
when
you
sensitive
to
it
and
into
the
club
he
went
with
a
disturbed
heart
in
that
very
room
he
and
bosinney
had
talked
one
summer
afternoon
he
well
remembered
even
now
the
disguised
and
secret
lecture
he
had
given
that
young
man
in
the
interests
of
june
the
diagnosis
of
the
forsytes
he
had
hazarded
and
how
he
had
wondered
what
sort
of
woman
it
was
he
was
warning
him
against
and
now
he
was
almost
in
want
of
a
warning
himself
deuced
funny
he
thought
deuced
funny
chapter
discovers
what
he
wants
it
is
so
much
easier
to
say
then
we
know
where
we
are
than
to
mean
anything
particular
by
the
words
and
in
saying
them
soames
did
but
vent
the
jealous
rankling
of
his
instincts
he
got
out
of
the
cab
in
a
state
of
wary
himself
for
not
having
seen
irene
with
jolyon
for
having
seen
her
and
now
with
his
inability
to
tell
exactly
what
he
wanted
he
had
abandoned
the
cab
because
he
could
not
bear
to
remain
seated
beside
his
cousin
and
walking
briskly
eastwards
he
thought
trust
that
fellow
jolyon
a
yard
once
outcast
always
outcast
the
chap
had
a
natural
sympathy
he
had
shied
at
the
word
sin
because
it
was
too
melodramatic
for
use
by
a
forsyte
indecision
in
desire
was
to
him
a
new
feeling
he
was
like
a
child
between
a
promised
toy
and
an
old
one
which
had
been
taken
away
from
him
and
he
was
astonished
at
himself
only
last
sunday
desire
had
seemed
his
freedom
and
annette
go
and
dine
there
he
thought
to
see
her
might
bring
back
his
singleness
of
intention
calm
his
exasperation
clear
his
mind
the
restaurant
was
fairly
good
many
foreigners
and
folk
whom
from
their
appearance
he
took
to
be
literary
or
artistic
scraps
of
conversation
came
his
way
through
the
clatter
of
plates
and
glasses
he
distinctly
heard
the
boers
sympathised
with
the
british
government
blamed
think
much
of
their
clientele
he
thought
he
went
stolidly
through
his
dinner
and
special
coffee
without
making
his
presence
known
and
when
at
last
he
had
finished
was
careful
not
to
be
seen
going
towards
the
sanctum
of
madame
lamotte
they
were
as
he
entered
having
a
much
supper
than
the
dinner
he
had
eaten
that
he
felt
a
kind
of
they
greeted
him
with
a
surprise
so
seemingly
genuine
that
he
thought
with
sudden
suspicion
believe
they
knew
i
was
here
all
the
time
he
gave
annette
a
look
furtive
and
searching
so
pretty
seemingly
so
candid
could
she
be
angling
for
him
he
turned
to
madame
lamotte
and
said
i
been
dining
really
if
she
had
only
known
there
were
dishes
she
could
have
recommended
what
a
pity
soames
was
confirmed
in
his
suspicion
must
look
out
what
i
doing
he
thought
sharply
another
little
cup
of
very
special
coffee
monsieur
a
liqueur
grand
marnier
and
madame
lamotte
rose
to
order
these
delicacies
alone
with
annette
soames
said
well
annette
with
a
defensive
little
smile
about
his
lips
the
girl
blushed
this
which
last
sunday
would
have
set
his
nerves
tingling
now
gave
him
much
the
same
feeling
a
man
has
when
a
dog
that
he
owns
wriggles
and
looks
at
him
he
had
a
curious
sense
of
power
as
if
he
could
have
said
to
her
and
kiss
me
and
she
would
have
come
and
was
there
seemed
another
face
and
form
in
the
room
too
and
the
itch
in
his
nerves
was
it
for
for
this
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
restaurant
and
said
you
have
some
queer
customers
do
you
like
this
life
annette
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
looked
down
and
played
with
her
fork
no
she
said
i
do
not
like
got
her
thought
soames
i
want
her
but
do
i
want
her
she
was
graceful
she
was
pretty
she
was
fresh
she
had
taste
of
a
kind
his
eyes
travelled
round
the
little
room
but
the
eyes
of
his
mind
went
another
and
silvery
walls
a
satinwood
piano
a
woman
standing
against
it
reined
back
as
it
were
from
woman
with
white
shoulders
that
he
knew
and
dark
eyes
that
he
had
sought
to
know
and
hair
like
dull
dark
amber
and
as
in
an
artist
who
strives
for
the
unrealisable
and
is
ever
thirsty
so
there
rose
in
him
at
that
moment
the
thirst
of
the
old
passion
he
had
never
satisfied
well
he
said
calmly
you
young
there
everything
before
annette
shook
her
head
i
think
sometimes
there
is
nothing
before
me
but
hard
work
i
am
not
so
in
love
with
work
as
your
mother
is
a
wonder
said
soames
faintly
mocking
she
will
never
let
failure
lodge
in
her
annette
sighed
it
must
be
wonderful
to
be
oh
you
be
rich
some
day
answered
soames
still
with
that
faint
mockery
do
be
annette
shrugged
her
shoulders
monsieur
is
very
and
between
her
pouting
lips
she
put
a
chocolate
my
dear
thought
soames
very
pretty
madame
lamotte
with
coffee
and
liqueur
put
an
end
to
that
colloquy
soames
did
not
stay
long
outside
in
the
streets
of
soho
which
always
gave
him
such
a
feeling
of
property
improperly
owned
he
mused
if
only
irene
had
given
him
a
son
he
would
now
be
squirming
after
women
the
thought
had
jumped
out
of
its
little
dark
in
his
inner
consciousness
a
to
look
forward
to
something
to
make
the
rest
of
life
worth
while
something
to
leave
himself
to
some
perpetuity
of
self
i
had
a
son
he
thought
bitterly
proper
legal
son
i
could
make
shift
to
go
on
as
i
used
one
woman
much
the
same
as
another
after
all
but
as
he
walked
he
shook
his
head
no
one
woman
was
not
the
same
as
another
many
a
time
had
he
tried
to
think
that
in
the
old
days
of
his
thwarted
married
life
and
he
had
always
failed
he
was
failing
now
he
was
trying
to
think
annette
the
same
as
that
other
but
she
was
not
she
had
not
the
lure
of
that
old
passion
irene
my
wife
he
thought
legal
wife
i
have
done
nothing
to
put
her
away
from
me
why
she
come
back
to
me
it
the
right
thing
the
lawful
thing
it
makes
no
scandal
no
disturbance
if
it
disagreeable
to
why
should
it
be
i
not
a
leper
and
no
longer
in
love
why
should
he
be
put
to
the
shifts
and
the
sordid
disgraces
and
the
lurking
defeats
of
the
divorce
court
when
there
she
was
like
an
empty
house
only
waiting
to
be
retaken
into
use
and
possession
by
him
who
legally
owned
her
to
one
so
secretive
as
soames
the
thought
of
reentry
into
quiet
possession
of
his
own
property
with
nothing
given
away
to
the
world
was
intensely
alluring
he
mused
glad
i
went
to
see
that
girl
i
know
now
what
i
want
most
if
only
irene
will
come
back
i
be
as
considerate
as
she
wishes
she
could
live
her
own
life
but
she
would
come
round
to
me
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
doggedly
along
by
the
railings
of
the
green
park
towards
his
father
house
he
went
trying
to
tread
on
his
shadow
walking
before
him
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
part
ii
chapter
third
generation
jolly
forsyte
was
strolling
down
high
street
oxford
on
a
november
afternoon
val
dartie
was
strolling
up
jolly
had
just
changed
out
of
boating
flannels
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
to
which
he
had
recently
been
elected
val
had
just
changed
out
of
riding
clothes
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
bookmaker
in
cornmarket
hallo
said
jolly
hallo
replied
val
the
cousins
had
met
but
twice
jolly
the
man
having
invited
the
freshman
to
breakfast
and
last
evening
they
had
seen
each
other
again
under
somewhat
exotic
circumstances
over
a
tailor
in
the
cornmarket
resided
one
of
those
privileged
young
beings
called
minors
whose
inheritances
are
large
whose
parents
are
dead
whose
guardians
are
remote
and
whose
instincts
are
vicious
at
nineteen
he
had
commenced
one
of
those
careers
attractive
and
inexplicable
to
ordinary
mortals
for
whom
a
single
bankruptcy
is
good
as
a
feast
already
famous
for
having
the
only
roulette
table
then
to
be
found
in
oxford
he
was
anticipating
his
expectations
at
a
dazzling
rate
he
crum
though
of
a
sanguine
and
rather
beefy
type
which
lacked
the
latter
fascinating
languor
for
val
it
had
been
in
the
nature
of
baptism
to
be
taken
there
to
play
roulette
in
the
nature
of
confirmation
to
get
back
into
college
after
hours
through
a
window
whose
bars
were
deceptive
once
during
that
evening
of
delight
glancing
up
from
the
seductive
green
before
him
he
had
caught
sight
through
a
cloud
of
smoke
of
his
cousin
standing
opposite
gagne
impair
et
manque
he
had
not
seen
him
again
come
in
to
the
and
have
tea
said
jolly
and
they
went
in
a
stranger
seeing
them
together
would
have
noticed
an
unseizable
resemblance
between
these
second
cousins
of
the
third
generations
of
forsytes
the
same
bone
formation
in
face
though
jolly
eyes
were
darker
grey
his
hair
lighter
and
more
wavy
tea
and
buttered
buns
waiter
please
said
jolly
have
one
of
my
cigarettes
said
val
i
saw
you
last
night
how
did
you
do
i
did
i
won
fifteen
though
desirous
of
repeating
a
whimsical
comment
on
gambling
he
had
once
heard
his
father
you
fleeced
you
sick
and
when
you
fleece
you
contented
himself
with
rotten
game
i
think
i
was
at
school
with
that
chap
he
an
awful
oh
i
do
know
said
val
as
one
might
speak
in
defence
of
a
disparaged
god
he
a
pretty
good
they
exchanged
whiffs
in
silence
you
met
my
people
did
you
said
jolly
they
coming
up
val
grew
a
little
red
really
i
can
give
you
a
rare
good
tip
for
the
manchester
november
thanks
i
only
take
interest
in
the
classic
you
ca
make
any
money
over
them
said
val
i
hate
the
ring
said
jolly
there
such
a
row
and
stink
i
like
the
i
like
to
back
my
judgment
answered
val
jolly
smiled
his
smile
was
like
his
father
i
have
got
any
i
always
lose
money
if
i
you
have
to
buy
experience
of
yes
but
it
all
with
doing
people
in
the
of
course
or
they
do
the
jolly
looked
a
little
scornful
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
row
and
drive
about
i
going
to
play
polo
next
term
if
i
can
get
my
granddad
to
stump
that
old
uncle
james
is
it
what
he
like
older
than
forty
hills
said
val
and
always
thinking
he
going
to
be
i
suppose
my
granddad
and
he
were
i
do
believe
any
of
that
old
lot
were
sportsmen
said
val
they
must
have
worshipped
mine
did
said
jolly
warmly
val
flipped
the
ash
off
his
cigarette
money
only
fit
to
spend
he
said
i
wish
the
deuce
i
had
jolly
gave
him
that
direct
upward
look
of
judgment
which
he
had
inherited
from
old
jolyon
one
did
talk
about
money
and
again
there
was
silence
while
they
drank
tea
and
ate
the
buttered
buns
where
are
your
people
going
to
stay
asked
val
elaborately
casual
what
do
you
think
of
the
war
rotten
so
far
the
boers
are
sports
a
bit
why
do
they
come
out
into
the
open
why
should
they
they
got
everything
against
them
except
their
way
of
fighting
i
rather
admire
they
can
ride
and
shoot
admitted
val
but
they
a
lousy
lot
do
you
know
crum
of
merton
only
by
sight
he
in
that
fast
set
too
is
he
rather
and
val
said
fixedly
he
a
friend
of
oh
sorry
and
they
sat
awkwardly
staring
past
each
other
having
pitched
on
their
pet
points
of
snobbery
for
jolly
was
forming
himself
unconsciously
on
a
set
whose
motto
was
defy
you
to
bore
us
life
is
half
long
enough
and
we
going
to
talk
faster
and
more
crisply
do
more
and
know
more
and
dwell
less
on
any
subject
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
we
are
the
best
of
wire
and
whipcord
and
val
was
unconsciously
forming
himself
on
a
set
whose
motto
was
defy
you
to
interest
or
excite
us
we
have
had
every
sensation
or
if
we
have
we
pretend
we
have
we
are
so
exhausted
with
living
that
no
hours
are
too
small
for
us
we
will
lose
our
shirts
with
equanimity
we
have
flown
fast
and
are
past
everything
all
is
cigarette
smoke
bismillah
competitive
spirit
in
the
english
was
obliging
those
two
young
forsytes
to
have
ideals
and
at
the
close
of
a
century
ideals
are
mixed
the
aristocracy
had
already
in
the
main
adopted
the
principle
though
here
and
there
one
like
was
an
starkly
languid
for
that
gambler
nirvana
which
had
been
the
summum
bonum
of
the
old
and
of
mashers
in
the
eighties
and
round
crum
were
still
gathered
a
forlorn
hope
of
with
a
plutocratic
following
but
there
was
between
the
cousins
another
far
less
obvious
from
the
unseizable
family
resemblance
which
each
perhaps
resented
or
from
some
of
that
old
feud
persisting
still
between
their
branches
of
the
clan
formed
within
them
by
odd
words
or
dropped
by
their
elders
and
jolly
tinkling
his
teaspoon
was
musing
and
his
waistcoat
and
his
drawl
and
his
lord
and
val
finishing
his
bun
was
thinking
rather
a
young
beast
i
suppose
you
be
meeting
your
people
he
said
getting
up
i
wish
you
tell
them
i
should
like
to
show
them
over
that
anything
much
they
care
to
thanks
i
ask
would
they
lunch
i
got
rather
a
decent
jolly
doubted
if
they
would
have
time
you
ask
them
though
very
good
of
you
said
jolly
fully
meaning
that
they
should
not
go
but
instinctively
polite
he
added
you
better
come
and
have
dinner
with
us
rather
what
time
dress
and
they
parted
a
subtle
antagonism
alive
within
them
holly
and
her
father
arrived
by
a
midday
train
it
was
her
first
visit
to
the
city
of
spires
and
dreams
and
she
was
very
silent
looking
almost
shyly
at
the
brother
who
was
part
of
this
wonderful
place
after
lunch
she
wandered
examining
his
household
gods
with
intense
curiosity
jolly
was
panelled
and
art
represented
by
a
set
of
bartolozzi
prints
which
had
belonged
to
old
jolyon
and
by
college
young
men
live
young
men
a
little
heroic
and
to
be
compared
with
her
memories
of
val
jolyon
also
scrutinised
with
care
that
evidence
of
his
boy
character
and
tastes
jolly
was
anxious
that
they
should
see
him
rowing
so
they
set
forth
to
the
river
holly
between
her
brother
and
her
father
felt
elated
when
heads
were
turned
and
eyes
rested
on
her
that
they
might
see
him
to
the
best
advantage
they
left
him
at
the
barge
and
crossed
the
river
to
the
slight
in
of
all
the
forsytes
only
old
swithin
and
george
were
was
rowing
in
a
trial
eight
he
looked
very
earnest
and
strenuous
with
pride
jolyon
thought
him
the
boy
of
the
lot
holly
as
became
a
sister
was
more
struck
by
one
or
two
of
the
others
but
would
not
have
said
so
for
the
world
the
river
was
bright
that
afternoon
the
meadows
lush
the
trees
still
beautiful
with
colour
distinguished
peace
clung
around
the
old
city
jolyon
promised
himself
a
day
sketching
if
the
weather
held
the
eight
passed
a
second
time
spurting
home
along
the
face
was
very
set
so
as
not
to
show
that
he
was
blown
they
returned
across
the
river
and
waited
for
him
oh
said
jolly
in
the
christ
church
meadows
i
had
to
ask
that
chap
val
dartie
to
dine
with
us
he
wanted
to
give
you
lunch
and
show
you
so
i
thought
i
better
then
you
need
go
i
like
him
holly
rather
sallow
face
had
become
suffused
with
pink
why
not
oh
i
do
know
he
seems
to
me
rather
showy
and
bad
form
what
are
his
people
like
dad
he
only
a
second
cousin
is
he
jolyon
took
refuge
in
a
smile
ask
holly
he
said
she
saw
his
i
liked
val
holly
answered
staring
at
the
ground
before
her
his
uncle
she
stole
a
glance
at
jolly
from
under
her
lashes
did
you
ever
said
jolyon
with
whimsical
intention
hear
our
family
history
my
dears
it
quite
a
fairy
tale
the
first
jolyon
all
events
the
first
we
know
anything
of
and
that
would
be
your
in
the
land
of
dorset
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
being
by
profession
an
as
your
put
it
and
the
son
of
an
in
fact
your
grandfather
used
to
call
them
small
beer
he
looked
at
jolly
to
see
how
his
lordliness
was
standing
it
and
with
the
other
eye
noted
malicious
pleasure
in
the
slight
drop
of
her
brother
face
we
may
suppose
him
thick
and
sturdy
standing
for
england
as
it
was
before
the
industrial
era
began
the
second
jolyon
jolly
better
known
as
superior
dosset
houses
so
the
chronicle
runs
begat
ten
children
and
migrated
to
london
town
it
is
known
that
he
drank
sherry
we
may
suppose
him
representing
the
england
of
napoleon
wars
and
general
unrest
the
eldest
of
his
six
sons
was
the
third
jolyon
your
grandfather
my
merchant
and
chairman
of
companies
one
of
the
soundest
englishmen
who
ever
to
me
the
jolyon
voice
had
lost
its
irony
and
his
son
and
daughter
gazed
at
him
solemnly
he
was
just
and
tenacious
tender
and
young
at
heart
you
remember
him
and
i
remember
him
pass
to
the
others
your
james
that
young
val
grandfather
had
a
son
called
hangs
a
tale
of
no
love
lost
and
i
do
think
i
tell
it
you
james
and
the
other
eight
children
of
dosset
of
whom
there
are
still
five
alive
may
be
said
to
have
represented
victorian
england
with
its
principles
of
trade
and
individualism
at
five
per
cent
and
your
money
you
know
what
that
means
at
all
events
they
turned
thirty
thousand
pounds
into
a
cool
million
between
them
in
the
course
of
their
long
lives
they
never
did
a
wild
it
was
your
swithin
who
i
believe
was
once
swindled
at
and
was
called
forsyte
because
he
drove
a
pair
their
day
is
passing
and
their
type
not
altogether
for
the
advantage
of
the
country
they
were
pedestrian
but
they
too
were
sound
i
am
the
fourth
jolyon
poor
holder
of
the
no
dad
said
jolly
and
holly
squeezed
his
hand
yes
repeated
jolyon
a
poor
specimen
representing
i
afraid
nothing
but
the
end
of
the
century
unearned
income
amateurism
and
individual
different
thing
from
individualism
jolly
you
are
the
fifth
jolyon
forsyte
old
man
and
you
open
the
ball
of
the
new
as
he
spoke
they
turned
in
through
the
college
gates
and
holly
said
it
fascinating
none
of
them
quite
knew
what
she
meant
jolly
was
grave
the
rainbow
distinguished
as
only
an
oxford
hostel
can
be
for
lack
of
modernity
provided
one
small
private
in
which
holly
sat
to
receive
shy
and
alone
when
the
only
guest
arrived
rather
as
one
would
touch
a
moth
val
took
her
hand
and
would
she
wear
this
flower
it
would
look
ripping
in
her
hair
he
removed
a
gardenia
from
his
coat
oh
no
thank
could
but
she
took
it
and
pinned
it
at
her
neck
having
suddenly
remembered
that
word
val
buttonhole
would
give
offence
and
she
so
much
wanted
jolly
to
like
him
did
she
realise
that
val
was
at
his
best
and
quietest
in
her
presence
and
was
that
perhaps
half
the
secret
of
his
attraction
for
her
i
never
said
anything
about
our
ride
rather
not
it
just
between
by
the
uneasiness
of
his
hands
and
the
fidgeting
of
his
feet
he
was
giving
her
a
sense
of
power
very
delicious
a
soft
feeling
wish
to
make
him
happy
do
tell
me
about
oxford
it
must
be
ever
so
val
admitted
that
it
was
frightfully
decent
to
do
what
you
liked
the
lectures
were
nothing
and
there
were
some
very
good
chaps
only
he
added
of
course
i
wish
i
was
in
town
and
could
come
down
and
see
holly
moved
one
hand
shyly
on
her
knee
and
her
glance
dropped
you
have
forgotten
he
said
suddenly
gathering
courage
that
we
going
together
holly
smiled
oh
that
was
only
one
ca
do
that
sort
of
thing
after
one
grown
up
you
dash
it
cousins
can
said
val
next
long
begins
in
june
you
know
and
goes
on
for
watch
our
but
though
the
thrill
of
conspiracy
ran
through
her
veins
holly
shook
her
head
it
wo
come
off
she
murmured
wo
it
said
val
fervently
who
going
to
stop
it
not
your
father
or
your
at
this
moment
jolyon
and
jolly
came
in
and
romance
fled
into
patent
leather
and
holly
white
satin
toes
where
it
itched
and
tingled
during
an
evening
not
conspicuous
for
sensitive
to
atmosphere
jolyon
soon
felt
the
latent
antagonism
between
the
boys
and
was
puzzled
by
holly
so
he
became
unconsciously
ironical
which
is
fatal
to
the
expansiveness
of
youth
a
letter
handed
to
him
after
dinner
reduced
him
to
a
silence
hardly
broken
till
jolly
and
val
rose
to
go
he
went
out
with
them
smoking
his
cigar
and
walked
with
his
son
to
the
gates
of
christ
church
turning
back
he
took
out
the
letter
and
read
it
again
beneath
a
lamp
dear
jolyon
soames
came
again
birthday
you
were
right
i
must
stay
here
i
going
to
the
piedmont
hotel
but
i
wo
go
abroad
without
seeing
you
i
feel
lonely
and
yours
affectionately
he
folded
the
letter
back
into
his
pocket
and
walked
on
astonished
at
the
violence
of
his
feelings
what
had
the
fellow
said
or
done
he
turned
into
high
street
down
the
turf
and
on
among
a
maze
of
spires
and
domes
and
long
college
fronts
and
walls
bright
or
in
the
strong
moonlight
in
this
very
heart
of
england
gentility
it
was
difficult
to
realise
that
a
lonely
woman
could
be
importuned
or
hunted
but
what
else
could
her
letter
mean
soames
must
have
been
pressing
her
to
go
back
to
him
again
with
public
opinion
and
the
law
on
his
side
too
he
thought
gazing
at
the
broken
glass
shining
on
the
top
of
a
villa
garden
wall
when
it
comes
to
property
we
still
a
heathen
people
i
go
up
morning
i
dare
say
it
be
best
for
her
to
go
abroad
yet
the
thought
displeased
him
why
should
soames
hunt
her
out
of
england
besides
he
might
follow
and
out
there
she
would
be
still
more
helpless
against
the
attentions
of
her
own
husband
must
tread
warily
he
thought
fellow
could
make
himself
very
nasty
i
did
like
his
manner
in
the
cab
the
other
night
his
thoughts
turned
to
his
daughter
june
could
she
help
once
on
a
time
irene
had
been
her
greatest
friend
and
now
she
was
a
duck
such
as
must
appeal
to
june
nature
he
determined
to
wire
to
his
daughter
to
meet
him
at
paddington
station
retracing
his
steps
towards
the
rainbow
he
questioned
his
own
sensations
would
he
be
upsetting
himself
over
every
woman
in
like
case
no
he
would
not
the
candour
of
this
conclusion
discomfited
him
and
finding
that
holly
had
gone
up
to
bed
he
sought
his
own
room
but
he
could
not
sleep
and
sat
for
a
long
time
at
his
window
huddled
in
an
overcoat
watching
the
moonlight
on
the
roofs
next
door
holly
too
was
awake
thinking
of
the
lashes
above
and
below
val
eyes
especially
below
and
of
what
she
could
do
to
make
jolly
like
him
better
the
scent
of
the
gardenia
was
strong
in
her
little
bedroom
and
pleasant
to
her
and
val
leaning
out
of
his
window
in
was
gazing
at
a
moonlit
quadrangle
without
seeing
it
at
all
seeing
instead
holly
slim
and
as
she
sat
beside
the
fire
when
he
first
went
in
but
jolly
in
his
bedroom
narrow
as
a
ghost
lay
with
a
hand
beneath
his
cheek
and
dreamed
he
was
with
val
in
one
boat
rowing
a
race
against
him
while
his
father
was
calling
from
the
towpath
get
your
hands
away
there
bless
you
chapter
puts
it
to
the
touch
of
all
those
radiant
firms
which
emblazon
with
their
windows
the
west
end
of
london
gaves
and
cortegal
were
considered
by
soames
the
most
word
just
coming
into
fashion
he
had
never
had
his
uncle
swithin
taste
in
precious
stones
and
the
abandonment
by
irene
when
she
left
his
house
in
of
all
the
glittering
things
he
had
given
her
had
disgusted
him
with
this
form
of
investment
but
he
still
knew
a
diamond
when
he
saw
one
and
during
the
week
before
her
birthday
he
had
taken
occasion
on
his
way
into
the
poultry
or
his
way
out
therefrom
to
dally
a
little
before
the
greater
jewellers
where
one
got
if
not
money
worth
at
least
a
certain
cachet
with
the
goods
constant
cogitation
since
his
drive
with
jolyon
had
convinced
him
more
and
more
of
the
supreme
importance
of
this
moment
in
his
life
the
supreme
need
for
taking
steps
and
those
not
wrong
and
alongside
the
dry
and
reasoned
sense
that
it
was
now
or
never
with
his
now
or
never
if
he
were
to
range
himself
and
found
a
family
went
the
secret
urge
of
his
senses
roused
by
the
sight
of
her
who
had
once
been
a
passionately
desired
wife
and
the
conviction
that
it
was
a
sin
against
common
sense
and
the
decent
secrecy
of
forsytes
to
waste
the
wife
he
had
in
an
opinion
on
winifred
case
dreamer
would
much
have
preferred
waterbuck
but
they
had
made
him
a
judge
so
late
in
the
day
as
to
rouse
the
usual
suspicion
of
a
political
job
advised
that
they
should
go
forward
and
obtain
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
a
point
which
to
soames
had
never
been
in
doubt
when
they
had
obtained
a
decree
to
that
effect
they
must
wait
to
see
if
it
was
obeyed
if
not
it
would
constitute
legal
desertion
and
they
should
obtain
evidence
of
misconduct
and
file
their
petition
for
divorce
all
of
which
soames
knew
perfectly
well
they
had
marked
him
ten
and
one
this
simplicity
in
his
sister
case
only
made
him
the
more
desperate
about
the
difficulty
in
his
own
everything
in
fact
was
driving
him
towards
the
simple
solution
of
irene
return
if
it
were
still
against
the
grain
with
her
had
he
not
feelings
to
subdue
injury
to
forgive
pain
to
forget
he
at
least
had
never
injured
her
and
this
was
a
world
of
compromise
he
could
offer
her
so
much
more
than
she
had
now
he
would
be
prepared
to
make
a
liberal
settlement
on
her
which
could
not
be
upset
he
often
scrutinised
his
image
in
these
days
he
had
never
been
a
peacock
like
that
fellow
dartie
or
fancied
himself
a
woman
man
but
he
had
a
certain
belief
in
his
own
unjustly
for
it
was
and
preserved
neat
healthy
pale
unblemished
by
drink
or
excess
of
any
kind
the
forsyte
jaw
and
the
concentration
of
his
face
were
in
his
eyes
virtues
so
far
as
he
could
tell
there
was
no
feature
of
him
which
need
inspire
dislike
thoughts
and
yearnings
with
which
one
lives
daily
become
natural
even
if
in
their
inception
if
he
could
only
give
tangible
proof
enough
of
his
determination
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
please
her
why
should
she
not
come
back
to
him
he
entered
gaves
and
cortegal
therefore
on
the
morning
of
november
the
to
buy
a
certain
diamond
brooch
four
and
dirt
cheap
sir
at
the
money
it
a
lady
there
was
that
in
his
mood
which
made
him
accept
without
demur
and
he
went
on
into
the
poultry
with
the
flat
green
morocco
case
in
his
breast
pocket
several
times
that
day
he
opened
it
to
look
at
the
seven
soft
shining
stones
in
their
velvet
oval
nest
if
the
lady
does
like
it
sir
happy
to
exchange
it
any
time
but
there
no
fear
of
if
only
there
were
not
he
got
through
a
vast
amount
of
work
only
soother
of
the
nerves
he
knew
a
cablegram
came
while
he
was
in
the
office
with
details
from
the
agent
in
buenos
aires
and
the
name
and
address
of
a
stewardess
who
would
be
prepared
to
swear
to
what
was
necessary
it
was
a
timely
spur
to
soames
with
his
rooted
distaste
for
the
washing
of
dirty
linen
in
public
and
when
he
set
forth
by
underground
to
victoria
station
he
received
a
fresh
impetus
towards
the
renewal
of
his
married
life
from
the
account
in
his
evening
paper
of
a
fashionable
divorce
suit
the
homing
instinct
of
all
true
forsytes
in
anxiety
and
trouble
the
corporate
tendency
which
kept
them
strong
and
solid
made
him
choose
to
dine
at
park
lane
he
neither
could
nor
would
breath
a
word
to
his
people
of
his
reticent
and
the
thought
that
at
least
they
would
be
glad
if
they
knew
and
wish
him
luck
was
heartening
james
was
in
lugubrious
mood
for
the
fire
which
the
impudence
of
kruger
ultimatum
had
lit
in
him
had
been
by
the
poor
success
of
the
last
month
and
the
exhortations
to
effort
in
the
times
he
did
know
where
it
would
end
soames
sought
to
cheer
him
by
the
continual
use
of
the
word
buller
but
james
could
tell
there
was
he
got
stuck
on
that
hill
and
this
ladysmith
was
down
in
a
hollow
and
altogether
it
looked
to
him
a
kettle
of
fish
he
thought
they
ought
to
be
sending
the
were
the
chaps
they
did
a
lot
of
good
in
the
crimea
soames
shifted
the
ground
of
consolation
winifred
had
heard
from
val
that
there
had
been
a
and
a
bonfire
on
guy
fawkes
day
at
oxford
and
that
he
had
escaped
detection
by
blacking
his
face
ah
james
muttered
he
a
clever
little
but
he
shook
his
head
shortly
afterwards
and
remarked
that
he
did
know
what
would
become
of
him
and
looking
wistfully
at
his
son
murmured
on
that
soames
had
never
had
a
boy
he
would
have
liked
a
grandson
of
his
own
name
and
there
it
was
soames
flinched
he
had
not
expected
such
a
challenge
to
disclose
the
secret
in
his
heart
and
emily
who
saw
him
wince
said
nonsense
james
do
talk
like
that
but
james
not
looking
anyone
in
the
face
muttered
on
there
were
roger
and
nicholas
and
jolyon
they
all
had
grandsons
and
swithin
and
timothy
had
never
married
he
had
done
his
best
but
he
would
soon
be
gone
now
and
as
though
he
had
uttered
words
of
profound
consolation
he
was
silent
eating
brains
with
a
fork
and
a
piece
of
bread
and
swallowing
the
bread
soames
excused
himself
directly
after
dinner
it
was
not
really
cold
but
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
which
served
to
fortify
him
against
the
fits
of
nervous
shivering
to
which
he
had
been
subject
all
day
subconsciously
he
knew
that
he
looked
better
thus
than
in
an
ordinary
black
overcoat
then
feeling
the
morocco
case
flat
against
his
heart
he
sallied
forth
he
was
no
smoker
but
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
smoked
it
gingerly
as
he
walked
along
he
moved
slowly
down
the
row
towards
knightsbridge
timing
himself
to
get
to
chelsea
at
what
did
she
do
with
herself
evening
after
evening
in
that
little
hole
how
mysterious
women
were
one
lived
alongside
and
knew
nothing
of
them
what
could
she
have
seen
in
that
fellow
bosinney
to
send
her
mad
for
there
was
madness
after
all
in
what
she
had
moonstruck
madness
in
which
all
sense
of
values
had
been
lost
and
her
life
and
his
life
ruined
and
for
a
moment
he
was
filled
with
a
sort
of
exaltation
as
though
he
were
a
man
read
of
in
a
story
who
possessed
by
the
christian
spirit
would
restore
to
her
all
the
prizes
of
existence
forgiving
and
forgetting
and
becoming
the
godfather
of
her
future
under
a
tree
opposite
knightsbridge
barracks
where
the
struck
down
clear
and
white
he
took
out
once
more
the
morocco
case
and
let
the
beams
draw
colour
from
those
stones
yes
they
were
of
the
first
water
but
at
the
hard
closing
snap
of
the
case
another
cold
shiver
ran
through
his
nerves
and
he
walked
on
faster
clenching
his
gloved
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
coat
almost
hoping
she
would
not
be
in
the
thought
of
how
mysterious
she
was
again
beset
him
dining
alone
there
night
after
an
evening
dress
too
as
if
she
were
making
believe
to
be
in
society
playing
the
herself
not
even
a
dog
or
cat
so
far
as
he
had
seen
and
that
reminded
him
suddenly
of
the
mare
he
kept
for
station
work
at
mapledurham
if
ever
he
went
to
the
stable
there
she
was
quite
alone
half
asleep
and
yet
on
her
home
journeys
going
more
freely
than
on
her
way
out
as
if
longing
to
be
back
and
lonely
in
her
stable
would
treat
her
well
he
thought
incoherently
would
be
very
careful
and
all
that
capacity
for
home
life
of
which
a
mocking
fate
seemed
for
ever
to
have
deprived
him
swelled
suddenly
in
soames
so
that
he
dreamed
dreams
opposite
south
kensington
station
in
the
king
road
a
man
came
slithering
out
of
a
public
house
playing
a
concertina
soames
watched
him
for
a
moment
dance
crazily
on
the
pavement
to
his
own
drawling
jagged
sounds
then
crossed
over
to
avoid
contact
with
this
piece
of
drunken
foolery
a
night
in
the
what
asses
people
were
but
the
man
had
noticed
his
movement
of
avoidance
and
streams
of
genial
blasphemy
followed
him
across
the
street
hope
they
run
him
in
thought
soames
viciously
have
ruffians
like
that
about
with
women
out
alone
a
woman
figure
in
front
had
induced
this
thought
her
walk
seemed
oddly
familiar
and
when
she
turned
the
corner
for
which
he
was
bound
his
heart
began
to
beat
he
hastened
on
to
the
corner
to
make
certain
yes
it
was
irene
he
could
not
mistake
her
walk
in
that
little
drab
street
she
threaded
two
more
turnings
and
from
the
last
corner
he
saw
her
enter
her
block
of
flats
to
make
sure
of
her
now
he
ran
those
few
paces
hurried
up
the
stairs
and
caught
her
standing
at
her
door
he
heard
the
latchkey
in
the
lock
and
reached
her
side
just
as
she
turned
round
startled
in
the
open
doorway
do
be
alarmed
he
said
breathless
i
happened
to
see
you
let
me
come
in
a
she
had
put
her
hand
up
to
her
breast
her
face
was
colourless
her
eyes
widened
by
alarm
then
seeming
to
master
herself
she
inclined
her
head
and
said
very
soames
closed
the
door
he
too
had
need
to
recover
and
when
she
had
passed
into
the
waited
a
full
minute
taking
deep
breaths
to
still
the
beating
of
his
heart
at
this
moment
so
fraught
with
the
future
to
take
out
that
morocco
case
seemed
crude
yet
not
to
take
it
out
left
him
there
before
her
with
no
preliminary
excuse
for
coming
and
in
this
dilemma
he
was
seized
with
impatience
at
all
this
paraphernalia
of
excuse
and
justification
this
was
a
could
be
nothing
else
and
he
must
face
it
he
heard
her
voice
uncomfortably
pathetically
soft
why
have
you
come
again
did
you
understand
that
i
would
rather
you
did
not
he
noticed
her
dark
brown
velvet
corduroy
a
sable
boa
a
small
round
toque
of
the
same
they
suited
her
admirably
she
had
money
to
spare
for
dress
evidently
he
said
abruptly
it
your
birthday
i
brought
you
this
and
he
held
out
to
her
the
green
morocco
case
oh
soames
pressed
the
clasp
the
seven
stones
gleamed
out
on
the
pale
grey
velvet
why
not
he
said
just
as
a
sign
that
you
do
bear
me
any
i
soames
took
it
out
of
the
case
let
me
just
see
how
it
she
shrank
back
he
followed
thrusting
his
hand
with
the
brooch
in
it
against
the
front
of
her
dress
she
shrank
again
soames
dropped
his
hand
irene
he
said
let
bygones
be
bygones
if
i
can
surely
you
might
let
begin
again
as
if
nothing
had
been
wo
you
his
voice
was
wistful
and
his
eyes
resting
on
her
face
had
in
them
a
sort
of
supplication
she
who
was
standing
literally
with
her
back
against
the
wall
gave
a
little
gulp
and
that
was
all
her
answer
soames
went
on
can
you
really
want
to
live
all
your
days
in
this
little
hole
come
back
to
me
and
i
give
you
all
you
want
you
shall
live
your
own
life
i
swear
he
saw
her
face
quiver
ironically
yes
he
repeated
but
i
mean
it
this
time
i
only
ask
one
thing
i
just
just
want
a
son
do
look
like
that
i
want
one
his
voice
had
grown
hurried
so
that
he
hardly
knew
it
for
his
own
and
twice
he
jerked
his
head
back
as
if
struggling
for
breath
it
was
the
sight
of
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
dark
with
a
sort
of
fascinated
fright
which
pulled
him
together
and
changed
that
painful
incoherence
to
anger
is
it
so
very
unnatural
he
said
between
his
teeth
is
it
unnatural
to
want
a
child
from
one
own
wife
you
wrecked
our
life
and
put
this
blight
on
everything
we
go
on
only
half
alive
and
without
any
future
is
it
so
very
unflattering
to
you
that
in
spite
of
everything
still
want
you
for
my
wife
speak
for
goodness
sake
do
irene
seemed
to
try
but
did
not
succeed
i
do
want
to
frighten
you
said
soames
more
gently
heaven
knows
i
only
want
you
to
see
that
i
ca
go
on
like
this
i
want
you
back
i
want
irene
raised
one
hand
and
covered
the
lower
part
of
her
face
but
her
eyes
never
moved
from
his
as
though
she
trusted
in
them
to
keep
him
at
bay
and
all
those
years
barren
and
bitter
when
since
he
had
first
known
her
surged
up
in
one
great
wave
of
recollection
in
soames
and
a
spasm
that
for
his
life
he
could
not
control
constricted
his
face
it
not
too
late
he
said
it
you
only
believe
irene
uncovered
her
lips
and
both
her
hands
made
a
writhing
gesture
in
front
of
her
breast
soames
seized
them
do
she
said
under
her
breath
but
he
stood
holding
on
to
them
trying
to
stare
into
her
eyes
which
did
not
waver
then
she
said
quietly
i
am
alone
here
you
wo
behave
again
as
you
once
dropping
her
hands
as
though
they
had
been
hot
irons
he
turned
away
was
it
possible
that
there
could
be
such
relentless
unforgiveness
could
that
one
act
of
violent
possession
be
still
alive
within
her
did
it
bar
him
thus
utterly
and
doggedly
he
said
without
looking
up
i
am
not
going
till
you
answered
me
i
am
offering
what
few
men
would
bring
themselves
to
offer
i
want
reasonable
and
almost
with
surprise
he
heard
her
say
you
ca
have
a
reasonable
answer
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
can
only
have
the
brutal
truth
i
would
rather
soames
stared
at
her
oh
he
said
and
there
intervened
in
him
a
sort
of
paralysis
of
speech
and
movement
the
kind
of
quivering
which
comes
when
a
man
has
received
a
deadly
insult
and
does
not
yet
know
how
he
is
going
to
take
it
or
rather
what
it
is
going
to
do
with
him
oh
he
said
again
as
bad
as
that
indeed
you
would
rather
die
that
pretty
i
am
sorry
you
wanted
me
to
answer
i
ca
help
the
truth
can
i
at
that
queer
spiritual
appeal
soames
turned
for
relief
to
actuality
he
snapped
the
brooch
back
into
its
case
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
truth
he
said
there
no
such
thing
with
women
he
heard
the
whisper
yes
nerves
do
lie
have
you
discovered
that
he
was
silent
obsessed
by
the
thought
will
hate
this
woman
i
will
hate
her
that
was
the
trouble
if
only
he
could
he
shot
a
glance
at
her
who
stood
unmoving
against
the
wall
with
her
head
up
and
her
hands
clasped
for
all
the
world
as
if
she
were
going
to
be
shot
and
he
said
quickly
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
have
a
lover
if
you
had
you
would
be
such
a
little
he
was
conscious
before
the
expression
in
her
eyes
that
he
had
uttered
something
of
a
and
dropped
back
too
abruptly
into
the
verbal
freedom
of
his
connubial
days
he
turned
away
to
the
door
but
he
could
not
go
out
something
within
most
deep
and
secret
forsyte
quality
the
impossibility
of
letting
go
the
impossibility
of
seeing
the
fantastic
and
forlorn
nature
of
his
own
him
he
turned
about
again
and
there
stood
with
his
back
against
the
door
as
hers
was
against
the
wall
opposite
quite
unconscious
of
anything
ridiculous
in
this
separation
by
the
whole
width
of
the
room
do
you
ever
think
of
anybody
but
yourself
he
said
irene
lips
quivered
then
she
answered
slowly
do
you
ever
think
that
i
found
out
my
hopeless
terrible
very
first
week
of
our
marriage
that
i
went
on
trying
three
know
i
went
on
trying
was
it
for
myself
soames
gritted
his
teeth
god
knows
what
it
was
i
never
understood
you
i
shall
never
understand
you
you
had
everything
you
wanted
and
you
can
have
it
again
and
more
what
the
matter
with
me
i
ask
you
a
plain
question
what
is
it
unconscious
of
the
pathos
in
that
enquiry
he
went
on
passionately
i
not
lame
i
not
loathsome
i
not
a
boor
i
not
a
fool
what
is
it
what
the
mystery
about
me
her
answer
was
a
long
sigh
he
clasped
his
hands
with
a
gesture
that
for
him
was
strangely
full
of
expression
when
i
came
here
i
meant
everything
that
i
could
to
do
away
with
the
past
and
start
fair
again
and
you
meet
me
with
and
silence
and
sighs
there
nothing
tangible
it
like
a
spider
that
whisper
from
across
the
room
maddened
soames
afresh
well
i
do
choose
to
be
in
a
spider
web
i
cut
he
walked
straight
up
to
her
now
what
he
had
gone
up
to
her
to
do
he
really
did
not
know
but
when
he
was
close
the
old
familiar
scent
of
her
clothes
suddenly
affected
him
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
bent
forward
to
kiss
her
he
kissed
not
her
lips
but
a
little
hard
line
where
the
lips
had
been
drawn
in
then
his
face
was
pressed
away
by
her
hands
he
heard
her
say
oh
no
shame
compunction
sense
of
futility
flooded
his
whole
being
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
straight
out
chapter
to
irene
jolyon
found
june
waiting
on
the
platform
at
paddington
she
had
received
his
telegram
while
at
breakfast
her
studio
and
two
bedrooms
in
a
john
wood
been
selected
by
her
for
the
complete
independence
which
it
guaranteed
unwatched
by
grundy
unhindered
by
permanent
domestics
she
could
receive
lame
ducks
at
any
hour
of
day
or
night
and
not
seldom
had
a
duck
without
studio
of
its
own
made
use
of
june
she
enjoyed
her
freedom
and
possessed
herself
with
a
sort
of
virginal
passion
the
warmth
which
she
would
have
lavished
on
bosinney
and
of
her
forsyte
must
surely
have
tired
she
now
expended
in
championship
of
the
underdogs
and
budding
of
the
artistic
world
she
lived
in
fact
to
turn
ducks
into
the
swans
she
believed
they
were
the
very
fervour
of
her
protection
warped
her
judgments
but
she
was
loyal
and
liberal
her
small
eager
hand
was
ever
against
the
oppressions
of
academic
and
commercial
opinion
and
though
her
income
was
considerable
her
bank
balance
was
often
a
minus
quantity
she
had
come
to
paddington
station
heated
in
her
soul
by
a
visit
to
eric
cobbley
a
miserable
gallery
had
refused
to
let
that
genius
have
his
show
after
all
its
impudent
manager
after
visiting
his
studio
had
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
would
only
be
a
show
from
the
selling
point
of
view
this
crowning
example
of
commercial
cowardice
towards
her
favourite
lame
he
so
hard
up
with
a
wife
and
two
children
that
he
had
caused
her
account
to
be
still
making
the
blood
glow
in
her
small
resolute
face
and
her
hair
to
shine
more
than
ever
she
gave
her
father
a
hug
and
got
into
a
cab
with
him
having
as
many
fish
to
fry
with
him
as
he
with
her
it
became
at
once
a
question
which
would
fry
them
first
jolyon
had
reached
the
words
my
dear
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
when
glancing
at
her
face
he
perceived
by
her
blue
eyes
moving
from
side
to
the
tail
of
a
preoccupied
she
was
not
attending
dad
is
it
true
that
i
absolutely
ca
get
at
any
of
my
money
only
the
income
fortunately
my
how
perfectly
beastly
ca
it
be
done
somehow
there
must
be
a
way
i
know
i
could
buy
a
small
gallery
for
ten
thousand
a
small
gallery
murmured
jolyon
seems
a
modest
desire
but
your
grandfather
foresaw
i
think
cried
june
vigorously
that
all
this
care
about
money
is
awful
when
there
so
much
genius
in
the
world
simply
crushed
out
for
want
of
a
little
i
shall
never
marry
and
have
children
why
i
be
able
to
do
some
good
instead
of
having
it
all
tied
up
in
case
of
things
which
will
never
come
off
our
name
is
forsyte
my
dear
replied
jolyon
in
the
ironical
voice
to
which
his
impetuous
daughter
had
never
quite
grown
accustomed
and
forsytes
you
know
are
people
who
so
settle
their
property
that
their
grandchildren
in
case
they
should
die
before
their
parents
have
to
make
wills
leaving
the
property
that
will
only
come
to
themselves
when
their
parents
die
do
you
follow
that
nor
do
i
but
it
a
fact
anyway
we
live
by
the
principle
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
possibility
of
keeping
wealth
in
the
family
it
must
not
go
out
if
you
die
unmarried
your
money
goes
to
jolly
and
holly
and
their
children
if
they
marry
is
it
pleasant
to
know
that
whatever
you
do
you
can
none
of
you
be
destitute
but
ca
i
borrow
the
money
jolyon
shook
his
head
you
could
rent
a
gallery
no
doubt
if
you
could
manage
it
out
of
your
june
uttered
a
contemptuous
sound
yes
and
have
no
income
left
to
help
anybody
my
dear
child
murmured
jolyon
would
it
come
to
the
same
thing
no
said
june
shrewdly
i
could
buy
for
ten
thousand
that
would
only
be
four
hundred
a
year
but
i
should
have
to
pay
a
thousand
a
year
rent
and
that
would
only
leave
me
five
hundred
if
i
had
the
gallery
dad
think
what
i
could
do
i
could
make
eric
cobbley
name
in
no
time
and
ever
so
many
names
worth
making
make
themselves
in
when
they
did
you
ever
know
anybody
living
my
dear
improved
by
having
his
name
made
yes
you
said
june
pressing
his
arm
jolyon
started
he
thought
ah
now
she
going
to
ask
me
to
do
something
we
take
it
out
we
forsytes
each
in
our
different
ways
june
came
closer
to
him
in
the
cab
darling
she
said
you
buy
the
gallery
and
i
pay
you
four
hundred
a
year
for
it
then
neither
of
us
will
be
any
the
worse
off
besides
it
a
splendid
jolyon
wriggled
do
you
think
he
said
that
for
an
artist
to
buy
a
gallery
is
a
bit
dubious
besides
ten
thousand
pounds
is
a
lump
and
i
not
a
commercial
june
looked
at
him
with
admiring
appraisement
of
course
you
not
but
you
awfully
businesslike
and
i
sure
we
could
make
it
pay
it
be
a
perfect
way
of
scoring
off
those
wretched
dealers
and
and
again
she
squeezed
her
father
arm
jolyon
face
expressed
quizzical
despair
where
is
this
desirable
gallery
splendidly
situated
i
suppose
just
off
cork
thought
jolyon
knew
it
was
just
off
somewhere
now
for
what
i
want
out
of
her
well
i
think
of
it
but
not
just
now
you
remember
irene
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
and
see
her
soames
is
after
her
again
she
might
be
safer
if
we
could
give
her
asylum
the
word
asylum
which
he
had
used
by
chance
was
of
all
most
calculated
to
rouse
june
interest
irene
i
have
seen
her
since
of
course
i
love
to
help
it
was
jolyon
turn
to
squeeze
her
arm
in
warm
admiration
for
this
spirited
little
creature
of
his
begetting
irene
is
proud
he
said
with
a
sidelong
glance
in
sudden
doubt
of
june
discretion
she
difficult
to
help
we
must
tread
gently
this
is
the
place
i
wired
her
to
expect
us
let
send
up
our
i
ca
bear
soames
said
june
as
she
got
out
he
sneers
at
everything
that
is
irene
was
in
what
was
called
the
of
the
piedmont
hotel
nothing
if
not
morally
courageous
june
walked
straight
up
to
her
former
friend
kissed
her
cheek
and
the
two
settled
down
on
a
sofa
never
sat
on
since
the
hotel
foundation
jolyon
could
see
that
irene
was
deeply
affected
by
this
simple
forgiveness
so
soames
has
been
worrying
you
he
said
i
had
a
visit
from
him
last
night
he
wants
me
to
go
back
to
you
not
going
of
course
cried
june
irene
smiled
faintly
and
shook
her
head
but
his
position
is
horrible
she
murmured
it
his
own
fault
he
ought
to
have
divorced
you
when
he
jolyon
remembered
how
fervently
in
the
old
days
june
had
hoped
that
no
divorce
would
smirch
her
dead
and
faithless
lover
name
let
us
hear
what
irene
is
going
to
do
he
said
irene
lips
quivered
but
she
spoke
calmly
i
better
give
him
fresh
excuse
to
get
rid
of
how
horrible
cried
june
what
else
can
i
do
out
of
the
question
said
jolyon
very
quietly
sans
he
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
but
getting
up
quickly
she
half
turned
her
back
on
them
and
stood
regaining
control
of
herself
june
said
suddenly
well
i
shall
go
to
soames
and
tell
him
he
must
leave
you
alone
what
does
he
want
at
his
age
a
child
it
not
unnatural
a
child
cried
june
scornfully
of
course
to
leave
his
money
to
if
he
wants
one
badly
enough
let
him
take
somebody
and
have
one
then
you
can
divorce
him
and
he
can
marry
jolyon
perceived
suddenly
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
to
bring
violent
partizanship
was
fighting
soames
battle
it
would
be
best
for
irene
to
come
quietly
to
us
at
robin
hill
and
see
how
things
of
course
said
june
only
irene
looked
full
at
all
his
many
attempts
afterwards
to
analyze
that
glance
he
never
could
succeed
no
i
should
only
bring
trouble
on
you
all
i
will
go
he
knew
from
her
voice
that
this
was
final
the
irrelevant
thought
flashed
through
him
i
could
see
her
there
but
he
said
do
you
think
you
would
be
more
helpless
abroad
in
case
he
followed
i
do
know
i
can
but
june
sprang
up
and
paced
the
room
it
all
horrible
she
said
why
should
people
be
tortured
and
kept
miserable
and
helpless
year
after
year
by
this
disgusting
sanctimonious
law
but
someone
had
come
into
the
room
and
june
came
to
a
standstill
jolyon
went
up
to
irene
do
you
want
money
and
would
you
like
me
to
let
your
flat
yes
jolyon
when
shall
you
be
going
you
wo
go
back
there
in
the
meantime
will
you
this
he
said
with
an
anxiety
strange
to
himself
no
i
got
all
i
want
you
send
me
your
address
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
i
feel
you
a
built
on
sand
answered
jolyon
pressing
her
hand
hard
but
it
a
pleasure
to
do
anything
at
any
time
remember
that
and
if
you
change
your
mind
come
along
june
say
june
came
from
the
window
and
flung
her
arms
round
irene
do
think
of
him
she
said
under
her
breath
enjoy
yourself
and
bless
you
with
a
memory
of
tears
in
irene
eyes
and
of
a
smile
on
her
lips
they
went
away
extremely
silent
passing
the
lady
who
had
interrupted
the
interview
and
was
turning
over
the
papers
on
the
table
opposite
the
national
gallery
june
exclaimed
of
all
undignified
beasts
and
horrible
laws
but
jolyon
did
not
respond
he
had
something
of
his
father
balance
and
could
see
things
impartially
even
when
his
emotions
were
roused
irene
was
right
soames
position
was
as
bad
or
worse
than
her
own
as
for
the
catered
for
a
human
nature
of
which
it
took
a
naturally
low
view
and
feeling
that
if
he
stayed
in
his
daughter
company
he
would
in
one
way
or
another
commit
an
indiscretion
he
told
her
he
must
catch
his
train
back
to
oxford
and
hailing
a
cab
left
her
to
with
the
promise
that
he
would
think
over
that
gallery
but
he
thought
over
irene
instead
pity
they
said
was
akin
to
love
if
so
he
was
certainly
in
danger
of
loving
her
for
he
pitied
her
profoundly
to
think
of
her
drifting
about
europe
so
handicapped
and
lonely
hope
to
goodness
she
keep
her
head
he
thought
might
easily
grow
desperate
in
fact
now
that
she
had
cut
loose
from
her
poor
threads
of
occupation
he
could
imagine
how
she
would
go
beautiful
a
creature
hopeless
and
fair
game
for
anyone
in
his
exasperation
was
more
than
a
little
fear
and
jealousy
women
did
strange
things
when
they
were
driven
into
corners
wonder
what
soames
will
do
now
he
thought
rotten
idiotic
state
of
things
and
i
suppose
they
would
say
it
was
her
own
fault
very
preoccupied
and
sore
at
heart
he
got
into
his
train
mislaid
his
ticket
and
on
the
platform
at
oxford
took
his
hat
off
to
a
lady
whose
face
he
seemed
to
remember
without
being
able
to
put
a
name
to
her
not
even
when
he
saw
her
having
tea
at
the
rainbow
chapter
forsytes
fear
to
tread
quivering
from
the
defeat
of
his
hopes
with
the
green
morocco
case
still
flat
against
his
heart
soames
revolved
thoughts
bitter
as
death
a
spider
web
walking
fast
and
noting
nothing
in
the
moonlight
he
brooded
over
the
scene
he
had
been
through
over
the
memory
of
her
figure
rigid
in
his
grasp
and
the
more
he
brooded
the
more
certain
he
became
that
she
had
a
words
would
sooner
die
were
ridiculous
if
she
had
not
even
if
she
had
never
loved
him
she
had
made
no
fuss
until
bosinney
came
on
the
scene
no
she
was
in
love
again
or
she
would
not
have
made
that
melodramatic
answer
to
his
proposal
which
in
all
the
circumstances
was
reasonable
very
well
that
simplified
matters
take
steps
to
know
where
i
am
he
thought
go
to
the
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
but
even
in
forming
that
resolution
he
knew
he
would
have
trouble
with
himself
he
had
employed
polteed
agency
several
times
in
the
routine
of
his
profession
even
quite
lately
over
dartie
case
but
he
had
never
thought
it
possible
to
employ
them
to
watch
his
own
wife
it
was
too
insulting
to
himself
he
slept
over
that
project
and
his
wounded
rather
kept
vigil
only
while
shaving
did
he
suddenly
remember
that
she
called
herself
by
her
maiden
name
of
heron
polteed
would
not
know
at
first
at
all
events
whose
wife
she
was
would
not
look
at
him
obsequiously
and
leer
behind
his
back
she
would
just
be
the
wife
of
one
of
his
clients
and
that
would
be
was
he
not
his
own
solicitor
he
was
literally
afraid
not
to
put
his
design
into
execution
at
the
first
possible
moment
lest
after
all
he
might
fail
himself
and
making
warmson
bring
him
an
early
cup
of
coffee
he
stole
out
of
the
house
before
the
hour
of
breakfast
he
walked
rapidly
to
one
of
those
small
west
end
streets
where
polteed
and
other
firms
ministered
to
the
virtues
of
the
wealthier
classes
hitherto
he
had
always
had
polteed
to
see
him
in
the
poultry
but
he
well
knew
their
address
and
reached
it
at
the
opening
hour
in
the
outer
office
a
room
furnished
so
cosily
that
it
might
have
been
a
he
was
attended
by
a
lady
who
might
have
been
a
schoolmistress
i
wish
to
see
claud
polteed
he
knows
mind
my
to
keep
everybody
from
knowing
that
he
soames
forsyte
was
reduced
to
having
his
wife
spied
on
was
the
overpowering
consideration
claud
different
from
lewis
one
of
those
men
with
dark
hair
slightly
curved
noses
and
quick
brown
eyes
who
might
be
taken
for
jews
but
are
really
phoenicians
he
received
soames
in
a
room
hushed
by
thickness
of
carpet
and
curtains
it
was
in
fact
confidentially
furnished
without
trace
of
document
anywhere
to
be
seen
greeting
soames
deferentially
he
turned
the
key
in
the
only
door
with
a
certain
ostentation
if
a
client
sends
for
me
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
he
takes
what
precaution
he
likes
if
he
comes
here
we
convince
him
that
we
have
no
leakages
i
may
safely
say
we
lead
in
security
if
in
nothing
else
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
soames
gorge
had
risen
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
hide
from
this
man
that
he
had
any
but
professional
interest
in
the
matter
and
mechanically
his
face
assumed
its
sideway
smile
i
come
to
you
early
like
this
because
there
not
an
hour
to
lose
he
lost
an
hour
he
might
fail
himself
yet
have
you
a
really
trustworthy
woman
free
polteed
unlocked
a
drawer
produced
a
memorandum
ran
his
eyes
over
it
and
locked
the
drawer
up
again
yes
he
said
the
very
soames
had
seated
himself
and
crossed
his
but
a
faint
flush
which
might
have
been
his
normal
complexion
betrayed
him
send
her
off
at
once
then
to
watch
a
irene
heron
of
flat
c
truro
mansions
chelsea
till
further
precisely
said
polteed
divorce
i
presume
and
he
blew
into
a
mrs
blanch
in
i
shall
want
to
speak
to
her
in
ten
deal
with
any
reports
yourself
resumed
soames
and
send
them
to
me
personally
marked
confidential
sealed
and
registered
my
client
exacts
the
utmost
polteed
smiled
as
though
saying
are
teaching
your
grandmother
my
dear
sir
and
his
eyes
slid
over
soames
face
for
one
unprofessional
instant
make
his
mind
perfectly
easy
he
said
do
you
smoke
no
said
soames
understand
me
nothing
may
come
of
this
if
a
name
gets
out
or
the
watching
is
suspected
it
may
have
very
serious
polteed
nodded
i
can
put
it
into
the
cipher
category
under
that
system
a
name
is
never
mentioned
we
work
by
he
unlocked
another
drawer
and
took
out
two
slips
of
paper
wrote
on
them
and
handed
one
to
soames
keep
that
sir
it
your
key
i
retain
this
duplicate
the
case
call
the
party
watched
will
be
the
watcher
the
mansions
should
say
your
my
firm
myself
in
case
you
should
have
to
mention
your
client
in
writing
i
have
called
him
any
person
we
suspect
will
be
a
second
person
any
special
hint
or
instruction
while
we
about
it
no
said
soames
that
consideration
again
polteed
nodded
expense
soames
shrugged
in
reason
he
answered
curtly
and
got
up
keep
it
entirely
in
your
own
entirely
said
polteed
appearing
suddenly
between
him
and
the
door
i
shall
be
seeing
you
in
that
other
case
before
long
good
morning
his
eyes
slid
unprofessionally
over
soames
once
more
and
he
unlocked
the
door
good
morning
said
soames
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
out
in
the
street
he
swore
deeply
quietly
to
himself
a
web
and
to
cut
it
he
must
use
this
spidery
secret
unclean
method
so
utterly
repugnant
to
one
who
regarded
his
private
life
as
his
most
sacred
piece
of
property
but
the
die
was
cast
he
could
not
go
back
and
he
went
on
into
the
poultry
and
locked
away
the
green
morocco
case
and
the
key
to
that
cipher
destined
to
make
his
domestic
bankruptcy
odd
that
one
whose
life
was
spent
in
bringing
to
the
public
eye
all
the
private
coils
of
property
the
domestic
disagreements
of
others
should
dread
so
utterly
the
public
eye
turned
on
his
own
and
yet
not
odd
for
who
should
know
so
well
as
he
the
whole
unfeeling
process
of
legal
regulation
he
worked
hard
all
day
winifred
was
due
at
four
he
was
to
take
her
down
to
a
conference
in
the
temple
with
dreamer
and
waiting
for
her
he
the
letter
he
had
caused
her
to
write
the
day
of
dartie
departure
requiring
him
to
return
dear
montague
i
have
received
your
letter
with
the
news
that
you
have
left
me
for
ever
and
are
on
your
way
to
buenos
aires
it
has
naturally
been
a
great
shock
i
am
taking
this
earliest
opportunity
of
writing
to
tell
you
that
i
am
prepared
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
if
you
will
return
to
me
at
once
i
beg
you
to
do
so
i
am
very
much
upset
and
will
not
say
any
more
now
i
am
sending
this
letter
registered
to
the
address
you
left
at
your
club
please
cable
to
me
your
still
affectionate
wife
winifred
ugh
what
bitter
humbug
he
remembered
leaning
over
winifred
while
she
copied
what
he
had
pencilled
and
how
she
had
said
laying
down
her
pen
suppose
he
comes
soames
in
such
a
strange
tone
of
voice
as
if
she
did
not
know
her
own
mind
he
wo
come
he
had
answered
till
spent
his
money
that
why
we
must
act
at
annexed
to
the
copy
of
that
letter
was
the
original
of
dartie
drunken
scrawl
from
the
iseeum
club
soames
could
have
wished
it
had
not
been
so
manifestly
penned
in
liquor
just
the
sort
of
thing
the
court
would
pitch
on
he
seemed
to
hear
the
judge
voice
say
you
took
this
seriously
seriously
enough
to
write
him
as
you
did
do
you
think
he
meant
it
never
mind
the
fact
was
clear
that
dartie
had
sailed
and
had
not
returned
annexed
also
was
his
cabled
answer
impossible
return
soames
shook
his
head
if
the
whole
thing
were
not
disposed
of
within
the
next
few
months
the
fellow
would
turn
up
again
like
a
bad
penny
it
saved
a
thousand
a
year
at
least
to
get
rid
of
him
besides
all
the
worry
to
winifred
and
his
father
must
stiffen
dreamer
back
he
thought
must
push
it
on
winifred
who
had
adopted
a
kind
of
which
became
her
fair
hair
and
tall
figure
very
well
arrived
in
james
barouche
drawn
by
james
pair
soames
had
not
seen
it
in
the
city
since
his
father
retired
from
business
five
years
ago
and
its
incongruity
gave
him
a
shock
are
changing
he
thought
does
know
what
go
next
top
hats
even
were
scarcer
he
enquired
after
val
val
said
winifred
wrote
that
he
was
going
to
play
polo
next
term
she
thought
he
was
in
a
very
good
set
she
added
with
fashionably
disguised
anxiety
will
there
be
much
publicity
about
my
affair
soames
must
it
be
in
the
papers
it
so
bad
for
him
and
the
with
his
own
calamity
all
raw
within
him
soames
answered
the
papers
are
a
pushing
lot
it
very
difficult
to
keep
things
out
they
pretend
to
be
guarding
the
public
morals
and
they
corrupt
them
with
their
beastly
reports
but
we
have
got
to
that
yet
only
seeing
dreamer
on
the
restitution
question
of
course
he
understands
that
it
to
lead
to
a
divorce
but
you
must
seem
genuinely
anxious
to
get
dartie
might
practice
that
attitude
winifred
sighed
oh
what
a
clown
monty
been
she
said
soames
gave
her
a
sharp
look
it
was
clear
to
him
that
she
could
not
take
her
dartie
seriously
and
would
go
back
on
the
whole
thing
if
given
half
a
chance
his
own
instinct
had
been
firm
in
this
matter
from
the
first
to
save
a
little
scandal
now
would
only
bring
on
his
sister
and
her
children
real
disgrace
and
perhaps
ruin
later
on
if
dartie
were
allowed
to
hang
on
to
them
going
and
spending
the
money
james
would
leave
his
daughter
though
it
was
all
tied
up
that
fellow
would
milk
the
settlements
somehow
and
make
his
family
pay
through
the
nose
to
keep
him
out
of
bankruptcy
or
even
perhaps
gaol
they
left
the
shining
carriage
with
the
shining
horses
and
the
servants
on
the
embankment
and
walked
up
to
dreamer
chambers
in
crown
office
row
mr
bellby
is
here
sir
said
the
clerk
mr
dreamer
will
be
ten
bellby
the
as
junior
as
he
might
have
been
for
soames
only
employed
barristers
of
established
reputation
it
was
indeed
something
of
a
mystery
to
him
how
barristers
ever
managed
to
establish
that
which
made
him
employ
bellby
was
seated
taking
a
final
glance
through
his
papers
he
had
come
from
court
and
was
in
wig
and
gown
which
suited
a
nose
jutting
out
like
the
handle
of
a
tiny
pump
his
small
shrewd
blue
eyes
and
rather
protruding
lower
better
man
to
supplement
and
stiffen
dreamer
the
introduction
to
winifred
accomplished
they
leaped
the
weather
and
spoke
of
the
war
soames
interrupted
suddenly
if
he
does
comply
we
ca
bring
proceedings
for
six
months
i
want
to
get
on
with
the
matter
bellby
who
had
the
ghost
of
an
irish
brogue
smiled
at
winifred
and
murmured
the
law
delays
six
months
repeated
soames
it
drive
it
up
to
june
we
get
the
suit
on
till
after
the
long
vacation
we
must
put
the
screw
on
bellby
would
have
all
his
work
cut
out
to
keep
winifred
up
to
the
scratch
mr
dreamer
will
see
you
now
they
filed
in
bellby
going
first
and
soames
escorting
winifred
after
an
interval
of
one
minute
by
his
watch
dreamer
in
a
gown
but
divested
of
wig
was
standing
before
the
fire
as
if
this
conference
were
in
the
nature
of
a
treat
he
had
the
leathery
rather
oily
complexion
which
goes
with
great
learning
a
considerable
nose
with
glasses
perched
on
it
and
little
greyish
whiskers
he
luxuriated
in
the
perpetual
cocking
of
one
eye
and
the
concealment
of
his
lower
with
his
upper
lip
which
gave
a
smothered
turn
to
his
speech
he
had
a
way
too
of
coming
suddenly
round
the
corner
on
the
person
he
was
talking
to
this
with
a
disconcerting
tone
of
voice
and
a
habit
of
growling
before
he
began
to
secured
a
reputation
second
in
probate
and
divorce
to
very
few
having
listened
eye
cocked
to
bellby
breezy
recapitulation
of
the
facts
he
growled
and
said
i
know
all
that
and
coming
round
the
corner
at
winifred
smothered
the
words
we
want
to
get
him
back
do
we
dartie
soames
interposed
sharply
my
sister
position
of
course
is
dreamer
growled
exactly
now
can
we
rely
on
the
cabled
refusal
or
must
we
wait
till
after
christmas
to
give
him
a
chance
to
have
the
point
is
it
the
sooner
soames
began
what
do
you
say
bellby
said
dreamer
coming
round
his
corner
bellby
seemed
to
sniff
the
air
like
a
hound
we
wo
be
on
till
the
middle
of
december
we
no
need
to
give
um
more
rope
than
no
said
soames
why
should
my
sister
be
incommoded
by
his
choosing
to
go
to
jericho
said
dreamer
again
coming
round
his
corner
quite
so
people
ought
to
go
to
jericho
ought
they
dartie
and
he
raised
his
gown
into
a
sort
of
fantail
i
agree
we
can
go
forward
is
there
anything
more
nothing
at
present
said
soames
meaningly
i
wanted
you
to
see
my
dreamer
growled
softly
delighted
good
evening
and
let
fall
the
protection
of
his
gown
they
filed
out
winifred
went
down
the
stairs
soames
lingered
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
impressed
by
dreamer
the
evidence
is
all
right
i
think
he
said
to
bellby
between
ourselves
if
we
do
get
the
thing
through
quick
we
never
may
think
he
understands
that
i
make
um
said
bellby
good
man
soames
nodded
and
hastened
after
his
sister
he
found
her
in
a
draught
biting
her
lips
behind
her
veil
and
at
once
said
the
evidence
of
the
stewardess
will
be
very
winifred
face
hardened
she
drew
herself
up
and
they
walked
to
the
carriage
and
all
through
that
silent
drive
back
to
green
street
the
souls
of
both
of
them
revolved
a
single
thought
oh
why
should
i
have
to
expose
my
misfortune
to
the
public
like
this
why
have
to
employ
spies
to
peer
into
my
private
troubles
they
were
not
of
my
making
chapter
sits
in
judgment
the
possessive
instinct
which
so
determinedly
balked
was
animating
two
members
of
the
forsyte
family
towards
riddance
of
what
they
could
no
longer
possess
was
hardening
daily
in
the
british
body
politic
nicholas
originally
so
doubtful
concerning
a
war
which
must
affect
property
had
been
heard
to
say
that
these
boers
were
a
lot
they
were
causing
a
lot
of
expense
and
the
sooner
they
had
their
lesson
the
better
he
would
send
out
wolseley
seeing
always
a
little
further
than
other
the
most
considerable
fortune
of
all
the
had
perceived
already
that
buller
was
not
the
bull
of
a
chap
who
just
went
butting
and
if
they
did
look
out
ladysmith
would
fall
this
was
early
in
december
so
that
when
black
week
came
he
was
enabled
to
say
to
everybody
told
you
so
during
that
week
of
gloom
such
as
no
forsyte
could
remember
very
young
nicholas
attended
so
many
drills
in
his
corps
devil
own
that
young
nicholas
consulted
the
family
physician
about
his
son
health
and
was
alarmed
to
find
that
he
was
perfectly
sound
the
boy
had
only
just
eaten
his
dinners
and
been
called
to
the
bar
at
some
expense
and
it
was
in
a
way
a
nightmare
to
his
father
and
mother
that
he
should
be
playing
with
military
efficiency
at
a
time
when
military
efficiency
in
the
civilian
population
might
conceivably
be
wanted
his
grandfather
of
course
the
notion
too
thoroughly
educated
in
the
feeling
that
no
british
war
could
be
other
than
little
and
professional
and
profoundly
distrustful
of
imperial
commitments
by
which
moreover
he
stood
to
lose
for
he
owned
de
beers
now
going
down
fast
more
than
a
sufficient
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
his
grandson
at
oxford
however
rather
different
sentiments
prevailed
the
inherent
effervescence
of
conglomerate
youth
had
during
the
two
months
of
the
term
before
black
week
been
gradually
crystallising
out
into
vivid
oppositions
normal
adolescence
ever
in
england
of
a
conservative
tendency
though
not
taking
things
too
seriously
was
vehement
for
a
fight
to
a
finish
and
a
good
licking
for
the
boers
of
this
larger
faction
val
dartie
was
naturally
a
member
radical
youth
on
the
other
hand
a
small
but
perhaps
more
vocal
body
was
for
stopping
the
war
and
giving
the
boers
autonomy
until
black
week
however
the
groups
were
amorphous
without
sharp
edges
and
argument
remained
but
academic
jolly
was
one
of
those
who
knew
not
where
he
stood
a
streak
of
his
grandfather
old
jolyon
love
of
justice
prevented
him
from
seeing
one
side
only
moreover
in
his
set
of
best
there
was
a
of
extremely
advanced
opinions
and
some
personal
magnetism
jolly
wavered
his
father
too
seemed
doubtful
in
his
views
and
though
as
was
proper
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
his
father
watchful
for
defects
which
might
still
be
remedied
still
that
father
had
an
which
gave
a
sort
of
glamour
to
his
creed
of
ironic
tolerance
artists
of
course
were
notoriously
and
to
this
extent
one
must
discount
for
one
father
even
if
one
loved
him
but
jolyon
original
view
that
to
your
nose
in
where
you
are
wanted
as
the
uitlanders
had
done
then
work
the
oracle
till
you
get
on
top
is
not
being
quite
the
clean
potato
had
whether
founded
in
fact
or
no
a
certain
attraction
for
his
son
who
thought
a
deal
about
gentility
on
the
other
hand
jolly
could
not
abide
such
as
his
set
called
and
val
set
called
so
that
he
was
still
balancing
when
the
clock
of
black
week
struck
came
those
ominous
repulses
at
stormberg
magersfontein
colenso
the
sturdy
english
soul
reacting
after
the
first
cried
but
methuen
after
the
second
but
buller
then
in
inspissated
gloom
hardened
and
jolly
said
to
himself
damn
it
we
got
to
lick
the
beggars
now
i
do
care
whether
we
right
or
wrong
and
if
he
had
known
it
his
father
was
thinking
the
same
thought
that
next
sunday
last
of
the
term
jolly
was
bidden
to
wine
with
of
the
best
after
the
second
toast
and
damnation
to
the
boers
heel
the
college
burgundy
he
noticed
that
val
dartie
also
a
guest
was
looking
at
him
with
a
grin
and
saying
something
to
his
neighbour
he
was
sure
it
was
disparaging
the
last
boy
in
the
world
to
make
himself
conspicuous
or
cause
public
disturbance
jolly
grew
rather
red
and
shut
his
lips
the
queer
hostility
he
had
always
felt
towards
his
was
strongly
and
suddenly
reinforced
right
he
thought
wait
my
friend
more
wine
than
was
good
for
him
as
the
custom
was
helped
him
to
remember
when
they
all
trooped
forth
to
a
secluded
spot
to
touch
val
on
the
arm
what
did
you
say
about
me
in
there
may
i
say
what
i
like
well
i
said
you
were
a
so
you
are
you
a
liar
want
a
row
of
course
but
not
here
in
the
all
right
come
they
went
eyeing
each
other
askance
unsteady
and
unflinching
they
climbed
the
garden
railings
the
spikes
on
the
top
slightly
ripped
sleeve
and
occupied
his
mind
jolly
mind
was
occupied
by
the
thought
that
they
were
going
to
fight
in
the
precincts
of
a
college
foreign
to
them
both
it
was
not
the
thing
but
never
young
beast
they
passed
over
the
grass
into
very
nearly
darkness
and
took
off
their
coats
you
not
screwed
are
you
said
jolly
suddenly
i
ca
fight
you
if
you
no
more
than
all
right
without
shaking
hands
they
put
themselves
at
once
into
postures
of
defence
they
had
drunk
too
much
for
science
and
so
were
especially
careful
to
assume
correct
attitudes
until
jolly
smote
val
almost
accidentally
on
the
nose
after
that
it
was
all
a
dark
and
ugly
scrimmage
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
old
trees
with
no
one
to
call
till
battered
and
blown
they
unclinched
and
staggered
back
from
each
other
as
a
voice
said
your
names
young
gentlemen
at
this
bland
query
spoken
from
under
the
lamp
at
the
garden
gate
like
some
demand
of
a
god
their
nerves
gave
way
and
snatching
up
their
coats
they
ran
at
the
railings
shinned
up
them
and
made
for
the
secluded
spot
whence
they
had
issued
to
the
fight
here
in
dim
light
they
mopped
their
faces
and
without
a
word
walked
ten
paces
apart
to
the
college
gate
they
went
out
silently
val
going
towards
the
broad
along
the
brewery
jolly
down
the
lane
towards
the
high
his
head
still
fumed
was
busy
with
regret
that
he
had
not
displayed
more
science
passing
in
review
the
counters
and
knockout
blows
which
he
had
not
delivered
his
mind
strayed
on
to
an
imagined
combat
infinitely
unlike
that
which
he
had
just
been
through
infinitely
gallant
with
sash
and
sword
with
thrust
and
parry
as
if
he
were
in
the
pages
of
his
beloved
dumas
he
fancied
himself
la
mole
and
aramis
bussy
chicot
and
rolled
into
one
but
he
quite
failed
to
envisage
val
as
coconnas
brissac
or
rochefort
the
fellow
was
just
a
confounded
cousin
who
did
come
up
to
cocker
never
mind
he
had
given
him
one
or
two
the
word
still
rankled
and
thoughts
of
enlisting
jostled
his
aching
head
of
riding
over
the
veldt
firing
gallantly
while
the
boers
rolled
over
like
rabbits
and
turning
up
his
smarting
eyes
he
saw
the
stars
shining
between
the
housetops
of
the
high
and
himself
lying
out
on
the
karoo
whatever
that
was
rolled
in
a
blanket
with
his
rifle
ready
and
his
gaze
fixed
on
a
glittering
heaven
he
had
a
fearful
next
morning
which
he
doctored
as
became
one
of
best
by
soaking
it
in
cold
water
brewing
strong
coffee
which
he
could
not
drink
and
only
sipping
a
little
hock
at
lunch
the
legend
that
fool
had
run
into
him
round
a
corner
accounted
for
a
bruise
on
his
cheek
he
would
on
no
account
have
mentioned
the
fight
for
on
second
thoughts
it
fell
far
short
of
his
standards
the
next
day
he
went
and
travelled
through
to
robin
hill
nobody
was
there
but
june
and
holly
for
his
father
had
gone
to
paris
he
spent
a
restless
and
unsettled
vacation
quite
out
of
touch
with
either
of
his
sisters
june
indeed
was
occupied
with
lame
ducks
whom
as
a
rule
jolly
could
not
stand
especially
that
eric
cobbley
and
his
family
outsiders
who
were
always
littering
up
the
house
in
the
vacation
and
between
holly
and
himself
there
was
a
strange
division
as
if
she
were
beginning
to
have
opinions
of
her
own
which
was
he
punched
viciously
at
a
ball
rode
furiously
but
alone
in
richmond
park
making
a
point
of
jumping
the
stiff
high
hurdles
put
up
to
close
certain
worn
avenues
of
his
nerve
in
he
called
it
jolly
was
more
afraid
of
being
afraid
than
most
boys
are
he
bought
a
rifle
too
and
put
a
range
up
in
the
home
field
shooting
across
the
pond
into
the
wall
to
the
peril
of
gardeners
with
the
thought
that
some
day
perhaps
he
would
enlist
and
save
south
africa
for
his
country
in
fact
now
that
they
were
appealing
for
yeomanry
recruits
the
boy
was
thoroughly
upset
ought
he
to
go
none
of
best
so
far
as
he
he
was
in
correspondence
with
thinking
of
joining
if
they
had
been
making
a
move
he
would
have
gone
at
competitive
and
with
a
strong
sense
of
form
he
could
not
bear
to
be
left
behind
in
to
do
it
off
his
own
bat
might
look
like
because
of
course
it
really
necessary
besides
he
did
not
want
to
go
for
the
other
side
of
this
young
forsyte
recoiled
from
leaping
before
he
looked
it
was
altogether
mixed
pickles
within
him
hot
and
sickly
pickles
and
he
became
quite
unlike
his
serene
and
rather
lordly
self
and
then
one
day
he
saw
that
which
moved
him
to
uneasy
riders
in
a
glade
of
the
park
close
to
the
ham
gate
of
whom
she
on
the
was
most
assuredly
holly
on
her
silver
roan
and
he
on
the
as
assuredly
that
val
dartie
his
first
impulse
was
to
urge
on
his
own
horse
and
demand
the
meaning
of
this
portent
tell
the
fellow
to
and
take
holly
home
his
feel
that
he
would
look
a
fool
if
they
refused
he
reined
his
horse
in
behind
a
tree
then
perceived
that
it
was
equally
impossible
to
spy
on
them
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
home
and
await
her
coming
sneaking
out
with
that
young
bounder
he
could
not
consult
with
june
because
she
had
gone
up
that
morning
in
the
train
of
eric
cobbley
and
his
lot
and
his
father
was
still
in
rotten
paris
he
felt
that
this
was
emphatically
one
of
those
moments
for
which
he
had
trained
himself
assiduously
at
school
where
he
and
a
boy
called
brent
had
frequently
set
fire
to
newspapers
and
placed
them
in
the
centre
of
their
studies
to
accustom
them
to
coolness
in
moments
of
danger
he
did
not
feel
at
all
cool
waiting
in
the
idly
stroking
the
dog
balthasar
who
queasy
as
an
old
fat
monk
and
sad
in
the
absence
of
his
master
turned
up
his
face
panting
with
gratitude
for
this
attention
it
was
half
an
hour
before
holly
came
flushed
and
ever
so
much
prettier
than
she
had
any
right
to
look
he
saw
her
look
at
him
of
followed
her
in
and
taking
her
arm
conducted
her
into
what
had
been
their
grandfather
study
the
room
not
much
used
now
was
still
vaguely
haunted
for
them
both
by
a
presence
with
which
they
associated
tenderness
large
drooping
white
moustaches
the
scent
of
cigar
smoke
and
laughter
here
jolly
in
the
prime
of
his
youth
before
he
went
to
school
at
all
had
been
wont
to
wrestle
with
his
grandfather
who
even
at
eighty
had
an
irresistible
habit
of
crooking
his
leg
here
holly
perched
on
the
arm
of
the
great
leather
chair
had
stroked
hair
curving
silvery
over
an
ear
into
which
she
would
whisper
secrets
through
that
window
they
had
all
three
sallied
times
without
number
to
cricket
on
the
lawn
and
a
mysterious
game
called
not
to
be
understood
by
outsiders
which
made
old
jolyon
very
hot
here
once
on
a
warm
night
holly
had
appeared
in
her
having
had
a
bad
dream
to
have
the
clutch
of
it
released
and
here
jolly
having
begun
the
day
badly
by
introducing
fizzy
magnesia
into
mademoiselle
beauce
egg
and
gone
on
to
worse
had
been
sent
down
in
the
absence
of
his
father
to
the
ensuing
dialogue
now
my
boy
you
must
go
on
like
well
she
boxed
my
ears
gran
so
i
only
boxed
hers
and
then
she
boxed
mine
strike
a
lady
that
never
do
have
you
begged
her
pardon
not
then
you
must
go
and
do
it
at
once
come
but
she
began
it
gran
and
she
had
two
to
my
my
dear
it
was
an
outrageous
thing
to
well
she
lost
her
temper
and
i
did
lose
come
you
come
too
then
time
and
they
had
gone
hand
in
hand
the
waverley
novels
and
byron
works
and
gibbon
roman
empire
and
humboldt
cosmos
and
the
bronzes
on
the
mantelpiece
and
that
masterpiece
of
the
oily
school
at
sunset
were
fixed
as
fate
and
for
all
sign
of
change
old
jolyon
might
have
been
sitting
there
still
with
legs
crossed
in
the
arm
chair
and
domed
forehead
and
deep
eyes
grave
above
the
they
came
those
two
grandchildren
and
jolly
said
i
saw
you
and
that
fellow
in
the
the
sight
of
blood
rushing
into
her
cheeks
gave
him
some
satisfaction
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
well
she
said
jolly
was
surprised
he
had
expected
more
or
less
do
you
know
he
said
weightily
that
he
called
me
a
last
term
and
i
had
to
fight
who
won
jolly
wished
to
answer
should
have
but
it
seemed
beneath
him
look
here
he
said
what
the
meaning
of
it
without
telling
anybody
why
should
i
dad
is
here
why
should
i
ride
with
him
you
got
me
to
ride
with
i
think
he
an
awful
young
holly
went
pale
with
anger
he
is
it
your
own
fault
for
not
liking
and
slipping
past
her
brother
she
went
out
leaving
him
staring
at
the
bronze
venus
sitting
on
a
tortoise
which
had
been
shielded
from
him
so
far
by
his
sister
dark
head
under
her
soft
felt
riding
hat
he
felt
queerly
disturbed
shaken
to
his
young
foundations
a
lifelong
domination
lay
shattered
round
his
feet
he
went
up
to
the
venus
and
mechanically
inspected
the
tortoise
why
did
he
like
val
dartie
he
could
not
tell
ignorant
of
family
history
barely
aware
of
that
vague
feud
which
had
started
thirteen
years
before
with
bosinney
defection
from
june
in
favour
of
wife
knowing
really
almost
nothing
about
val
he
was
at
sea
he
just
did
dislike
him
the
question
however
was
what
should
he
do
val
dartie
it
was
true
was
a
but
it
was
not
the
thing
for
holly
to
go
about
with
him
and
yet
to
of
what
he
had
chanced
on
was
against
his
creed
in
this
dilemma
he
went
and
sat
in
the
old
leather
chair
and
crossed
his
legs
it
grew
dark
while
he
sat
there
staring
out
through
the
long
window
at
the
old
ample
yet
bare
of
leaves
becoming
slowly
just
a
shape
of
deeper
dark
printed
on
the
dusk
he
thought
without
sequence
and
took
out
his
watch
he
could
not
see
the
hands
but
he
set
the
repeater
going
his
grandfather
first
gold
hunter
watch
with
the
milling
worn
from
it
and
dented
with
the
mark
of
many
a
fall
the
chime
was
like
a
little
voice
from
out
of
that
golden
age
when
they
first
came
from
john
wood
london
to
this
driving
with
grandfather
in
his
carriage
and
almost
instantly
took
to
the
trees
trees
to
climb
and
grandfather
watering
the
below
what
was
to
be
done
tell
dad
he
must
come
home
confide
in
june
she
was
sudden
do
nothing
and
trust
to
luck
after
all
the
vac
would
soon
be
over
go
up
and
see
val
and
warn
him
off
but
how
get
his
address
holly
would
give
it
him
a
maze
of
paths
a
cloud
of
possibilities
he
lit
a
cigarette
when
he
had
smoked
it
halfway
through
his
brow
relaxed
almost
as
if
some
thin
old
hand
had
been
passed
gently
over
it
and
in
his
ear
something
seemed
to
whisper
nothing
be
nice
to
holly
be
nice
to
her
my
dear
and
jolly
heaved
a
sigh
of
contentment
blowing
smoke
through
his
nostrils
but
up
in
her
room
divested
of
her
habit
holly
was
still
frowning
is
is
not
were
the
words
which
kept
forming
on
her
lips
chapter
in
two
minds
a
little
private
hotel
over
a
restaurant
near
the
gare
lazare
was
jolyon
haunt
in
paris
he
hated
his
fellow
forsytes
as
fish
out
of
water
in
their
runs
the
opera
rue
de
rivoli
and
moulin
rouge
their
air
of
having
come
because
they
wanted
to
be
somewhere
else
as
soon
as
possible
annoyed
him
but
no
other
forsyte
came
near
this
haunt
where
he
had
a
wood
fire
in
his
bedroom
and
the
coffee
was
excellent
paris
was
always
to
him
more
attractive
in
winter
the
acrid
savour
from
woodsmoke
and
braziers
the
sharpness
of
the
wintry
sunshine
on
bright
rays
the
open
cafes
defying
winter
the
brisk
boulevard
crowds
all
informed
him
that
in
winter
paris
possessed
a
soul
which
like
a
migrant
bird
in
high
summer
flew
away
he
spoke
french
well
had
some
friends
knew
little
places
where
pleasant
dishes
could
be
met
with
queer
types
observed
he
felt
philosophic
in
paris
the
edge
of
irony
sharpened
life
took
on
a
subtle
purposeless
meaning
became
a
bunch
of
flavours
tasted
a
darkness
shot
with
shifting
gleams
of
light
when
in
the
first
week
of
december
he
decided
to
go
to
paris
he
was
far
from
admitting
that
irene
presence
was
influencing
him
he
had
not
been
there
two
days
before
he
owned
that
the
wish
to
see
her
had
been
more
than
half
the
reason
in
england
one
did
not
admit
what
was
natural
he
had
thought
it
might
be
well
to
speak
to
her
about
the
letting
of
her
flat
and
other
matters
but
in
paris
he
at
once
knew
better
there
was
a
glamour
over
the
city
on
the
third
day
he
wrote
to
her
and
received
an
answer
which
procured
him
a
pleasurable
shiver
of
the
nerves
my
dear
jolyon
it
will
be
a
happiness
for
me
to
see
you
he
took
his
way
to
her
hotel
on
a
bright
day
with
a
feeling
such
as
he
had
often
had
going
to
visit
an
adored
picture
no
woman
so
far
as
he
remembered
had
ever
inspired
in
him
this
special
sensuous
and
yet
impersonal
sensation
he
was
going
to
sit
and
feast
his
eyes
and
come
away
knowing
her
no
better
but
ready
to
go
and
feast
his
eyes
again
such
was
his
feeling
when
in
the
tarnished
and
ornate
little
lounge
of
a
quiet
hotel
near
the
river
she
came
to
him
preceded
by
a
small
who
uttered
the
word
madame
and
vanished
her
face
her
smile
the
poise
of
her
figure
were
just
as
he
had
pictured
and
the
expression
of
her
face
said
plainly
friend
well
he
said
what
news
poor
exile
nothing
from
soames
i
have
let
the
flat
for
you
and
like
a
good
steward
i
bring
you
some
money
how
do
you
like
paris
while
he
put
her
through
this
catechism
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
lips
so
fine
and
sensitive
the
lower
lip
curving
just
a
little
upwards
the
upper
touched
at
one
corner
by
the
least
conceivable
dimple
it
was
like
discovering
a
woman
in
what
had
hitherto
been
a
sort
of
soft
and
statue
almost
impersonally
admired
she
owned
that
to
be
alone
in
paris
was
a
little
difficult
and
yet
paris
was
so
full
of
its
own
life
that
it
was
often
she
confessed
as
innocuous
as
a
desert
besides
the
english
were
not
liked
just
now
that
will
hardly
be
your
case
said
jolyon
you
should
appeal
to
the
it
has
its
jolyon
nodded
well
you
must
let
me
take
you
about
while
i
here
we
start
come
and
dine
at
my
pet
restaurant
and
we
go
to
the
it
was
the
beginning
of
daily
meetings
jolyon
soon
found
that
for
those
who
desired
a
static
condition
of
the
affections
paris
was
at
once
the
first
and
last
place
in
which
to
be
friendly
with
a
pretty
woman
revelation
was
alighting
like
a
bird
in
his
heart
singing
est
ton
reve
elle
est
ton
reve
sometimes
this
seemed
natural
sometimes
bad
case
of
elderly
rapture
having
once
been
ostracised
by
society
he
had
never
since
had
any
real
regard
for
conventional
morality
but
the
idea
of
a
love
which
she
could
never
how
could
she
at
his
age
mounted
beyond
his
subconscious
mind
he
was
full
too
of
resentment
at
the
waste
and
loneliness
of
her
life
aware
of
being
some
comfort
to
her
and
of
the
pleasure
she
clearly
took
in
their
many
little
outings
he
was
amiably
desirous
of
doing
and
saying
nothing
to
destroy
that
pleasure
it
was
like
watching
a
starved
plant
draw
up
water
to
see
her
drink
in
his
companionship
so
far
as
they
could
tell
no
one
knew
her
address
except
himself
she
was
unknown
in
paris
and
he
but
little
known
so
that
discretion
seemed
unnecessary
in
those
walks
talks
visits
to
concerts
theatres
little
dinners
expeditions
to
versailles
st
cloud
even
fontainebleau
and
time
of
those
full
months
without
past
to
it
or
future
what
in
his
youth
would
certainly
have
been
headlong
passion
was
now
perhaps
as
deep
a
feeling
but
far
gentler
tempered
to
protective
companionship
by
admiration
hopelessness
and
a
sense
of
in
his
veins
at
least
so
long
as
she
was
there
smiling
and
happy
in
their
friendship
and
always
to
him
more
beautiful
and
spiritually
responsive
for
her
philosophy
of
life
seemed
to
march
in
admirable
step
with
his
own
conditioned
by
emotion
more
than
by
reason
ironically
mistrustful
susceptible
to
beauty
almost
passionately
humane
and
tolerant
yet
subject
to
instinctive
rigidities
of
which
as
a
mere
man
he
was
less
capable
and
during
all
this
companionable
month
he
never
quite
lost
that
feeling
with
which
he
had
set
out
on
the
first
day
as
if
to
visit
an
adored
work
of
art
a
impersonal
desire
the
pendant
to
the
present
he
took
care
not
to
face
for
fear
of
breaking
up
his
untroubled
manner
but
he
made
plans
to
renew
this
time
in
places
still
more
delightful
where
the
sun
was
hot
and
there
were
strange
things
to
see
and
paint
the
end
came
swiftly
on
the
of
january
with
a
telegram
have
enlisted
in
imperial
yeomanry
jolyon
received
it
just
as
he
was
setting
out
to
meet
her
at
the
louvre
it
brought
him
up
with
a
round
turn
while
he
was
here
his
boy
whose
philosopher
and
guide
he
ought
to
be
had
taken
this
great
step
towards
danger
hardship
perhaps
even
death
he
felt
disturbed
to
the
soul
realising
suddenly
how
irene
had
twined
herself
round
the
roots
of
his
being
thus
threatened
with
severance
the
tie
between
it
had
become
a
kind
of
longer
had
impersonal
quality
the
tranquil
enjoyment
of
things
in
common
jolyon
perceived
was
gone
for
ever
he
saw
his
feeling
as
it
was
in
the
nature
of
an
infatuation
ridiculous
perhaps
but
so
real
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
disclose
itself
and
now
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
not
must
not
make
any
such
disclosure
the
news
of
jolly
stood
inexorably
in
the
way
he
was
proud
of
this
enlistment
proud
of
his
boy
for
going
off
to
fight
for
the
country
for
on
jolyon
too
black
week
had
left
its
mark
and
so
the
end
was
reached
before
the
beginning
well
luckily
he
had
never
made
a
sign
when
he
came
into
the
gallery
she
was
standing
before
the
of
the
rocks
graceful
absorbed
smiling
and
unconscious
i
to
give
up
seeing
that
he
thought
unnatural
so
long
as
she
willing
that
i
should
see
her
he
stood
unnoticed
watching
her
storing
up
the
image
of
her
figure
envying
the
picture
on
which
she
was
bending
that
long
scrutiny
twice
she
turned
her
head
towards
the
entrance
and
he
thought
for
me
at
last
he
went
forward
look
he
said
she
read
the
telegram
and
he
heard
her
sigh
that
sigh
too
was
for
him
his
position
was
really
cruel
to
be
loyal
to
his
son
he
must
just
shake
her
hand
and
go
to
be
loyal
to
the
feeling
in
his
heart
he
must
at
least
tell
her
what
that
feeling
was
could
she
would
she
understand
the
silence
in
which
he
was
gazing
at
that
picture
i
afraid
i
must
go
home
at
once
he
said
at
last
i
shall
miss
all
this
so
shall
i
but
of
course
you
must
well
said
jolyon
holding
out
his
hand
meeting
her
eyes
a
flood
of
feeling
nearly
mastered
him
such
is
life
he
said
take
care
of
yourself
my
dear
he
had
a
stumbling
sensation
in
his
legs
and
feet
as
if
his
brain
refused
to
steer
him
away
from
her
from
the
doorway
he
saw
her
lift
her
hand
and
touch
its
fingers
with
her
lips
he
raised
his
hat
solemnly
and
did
not
look
back
again
chapter
versus
dartie
the
versus
restitution
of
those
conjugal
rights
concerning
which
winifred
was
at
heart
so
deeply
undecided
followed
the
laws
of
subtraction
towards
day
of
judgment
this
was
not
reached
before
the
courts
rose
for
christmas
but
the
case
was
third
on
the
list
when
they
sat
again
winifred
spent
the
christmas
holidays
a
thought
more
fashionably
than
usual
with
the
matter
locked
up
in
her
bosom
james
was
particularly
liberal
to
her
that
christmas
expressing
thereby
his
sympathy
and
relief
at
the
approaching
dissolution
of
her
marriage
with
that
rascal
which
his
old
heart
felt
but
his
old
lips
could
not
utter
the
disappearance
of
dartie
made
the
fall
in
consols
a
comparatively
small
matter
and
as
to
the
real
animus
he
felt
against
that
fellow
and
the
increasing
lead
which
property
was
attaining
over
reputation
in
a
true
forsyte
about
to
leave
this
world
served
to
drug
a
mind
from
which
all
allusions
to
the
matter
except
his
own
were
studiously
kept
what
worried
him
as
a
lawyer
and
a
parent
was
the
fear
that
dartie
might
suddenly
turn
up
and
obey
the
order
of
the
court
when
made
that
would
be
a
pretty
the
fear
preyed
on
him
in
fact
so
much
that
in
presenting
winifred
with
a
large
christmas
cheque
he
said
it
chiefly
for
that
chap
out
there
to
keep
him
from
coming
it
was
of
course
to
pitch
away
good
money
but
all
in
the
nature
of
insurance
against
that
bankruptcy
which
would
no
longer
hang
over
him
if
only
the
divorce
went
through
and
he
questioned
winifred
rigorously
until
she
could
assure
him
that
the
money
had
been
sent
poor
woman
cost
her
many
a
pang
to
send
what
must
find
its
way
into
the
of
creature
soames
hearing
of
it
shook
his
head
they
were
not
dealing
with
a
forsyte
reasonably
tenacious
of
his
purpose
it
was
very
risky
without
knowing
how
the
land
lay
out
there
still
it
would
look
well
with
the
court
and
he
would
see
that
dreamer
brought
it
out
i
wonder
he
said
suddenly
where
that
ballet
goes
after
the
argentine
never
omitting
a
chance
of
reminder
for
he
knew
that
winifred
still
had
a
weakness
if
not
for
dartie
at
least
for
not
laundering
him
in
public
though
not
good
at
showing
admiration
he
admitted
that
she
was
behaving
extremely
well
with
all
her
children
at
home
gaping
like
young
birds
for
news
of
their
just
on
the
point
of
coming
out
and
val
very
restive
about
the
whole
thing
he
felt
that
val
was
the
real
heart
of
the
matter
to
winifred
who
certainly
loved
him
beyond
her
other
children
the
boy
could
spoke
the
wheel
of
this
divorce
yet
if
he
set
his
mind
to
it
and
soames
was
very
careful
to
keep
the
proximity
of
the
preliminary
proceedings
from
his
ears
he
did
more
he
asked
him
to
dine
at
the
remove
and
over
cigar
introduced
the
subject
which
he
knew
to
be
nearest
to
his
heart
i
hear
he
said
that
you
want
to
play
polo
up
at
val
became
less
recumbent
in
his
chair
rather
he
said
well
continued
soames
that
a
very
expensive
business
your
grandfather
is
likely
to
consent
to
it
unless
he
can
make
sure
that
he
not
got
any
other
drain
on
and
he
paused
to
see
whether
the
boy
understood
his
meaning
val
thick
dark
lashes
concealed
his
eyes
but
a
slight
grimace
appeared
on
his
wide
mouth
and
he
muttered
i
suppose
you
mean
my
dad
yes
said
soames
i
afraid
it
depends
on
whether
he
continues
to
be
a
drag
or
not
and
said
no
more
letting
the
boy
dream
it
over
but
val
was
also
dreaming
in
those
days
of
a
palfrey
and
a
girl
riding
it
though
crum
was
in
town
and
an
introduction
to
cynthia
dark
to
be
had
for
the
asking
val
did
not
ask
indeed
he
shunned
crum
and
lived
a
life
strange
even
to
himself
except
in
so
far
as
accounts
with
tailor
and
livery
stable
were
concerned
to
his
mother
his
sisters
his
young
brother
he
seemed
to
spend
this
vacation
in
fellows
and
his
evenings
sleepily
at
home
they
could
not
propose
anything
in
daylight
that
did
not
meet
with
the
one
response
sorry
i
got
to
see
a
fellow
and
he
was
put
to
extraordinary
shifts
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
house
unobserved
in
riding
clothes
until
being
made
a
member
of
the
goat
club
he
was
able
to
transport
them
there
where
he
could
change
unregarded
and
slip
off
on
his
hack
to
richmond
park
he
kept
his
growing
sentiment
religiously
to
himself
not
for
a
world
would
he
breathe
to
the
whom
he
was
not
anything
so
ridiculous
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
creed
and
his
but
he
could
not
help
its
destroying
his
other
appetites
it
was
coming
between
him
and
the
legitimate
pleasures
of
youth
at
last
on
its
own
in
a
way
which
must
he
knew
make
him
a
milksop
in
the
eyes
of
crum
all
he
cared
for
was
to
dress
in
his
riding
togs
and
steal
away
to
the
robin
hill
gate
where
presently
the
silver
roan
would
come
demurely
sidling
with
its
slim
and
rider
and
in
the
glades
bare
of
leaves
they
would
go
off
side
by
side
not
talking
very
much
riding
races
sometimes
and
sometimes
holding
hands
more
than
once
of
an
evening
in
a
moment
of
expansion
he
had
been
tempted
to
tell
his
mother
how
this
shy
sweet
cousin
had
stolen
in
upon
him
and
wrecked
his
but
bitter
experience
that
all
persons
above
were
prevented
him
after
all
he
supposed
he
would
have
to
go
through
with
college
and
she
would
have
to
out
before
they
could
be
married
so
why
complicate
things
so
long
as
he
could
see
her
sisters
were
teasing
and
unsympathetic
beings
a
brother
worse
so
there
was
no
one
to
confide
in
ah
and
this
beastly
divorce
business
what
a
misfortune
to
have
a
name
which
other
people
had
if
only
he
had
been
called
gordon
or
scott
or
howard
or
something
fairly
common
but
was
another
in
the
directory
one
might
as
well
have
been
named
morkin
for
all
the
covert
it
afforded
so
matters
went
on
till
one
day
in
the
middle
of
january
the
palfrey
and
its
rider
were
missing
at
the
tryst
lingering
in
the
cold
he
debated
whether
he
should
ride
on
to
the
house
but
jolly
might
be
there
and
the
memory
of
their
dark
encounter
was
still
fresh
within
him
one
could
not
be
always
fighting
with
her
brother
so
he
returned
dismally
to
town
and
spent
an
evening
plunged
in
gloom
at
breakfast
next
day
he
noticed
that
his
mother
had
on
an
unfamiliar
dress
and
was
wearing
her
hat
the
dress
was
black
with
a
glimpse
of
peacock
blue
the
hat
black
and
looked
exceptionally
well
but
when
after
breakfast
she
said
to
him
come
in
here
val
and
led
the
way
to
the
he
was
at
once
beset
by
qualms
winifred
carefully
shut
the
door
and
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
lips
inhaling
the
violette
de
parme
with
which
it
had
been
soaked
val
thought
she
found
out
about
holly
her
voice
interrupted
are
you
going
to
be
nice
to
me
dear
boy
val
grinned
doubtfully
will
you
come
with
me
this
morning
i
got
to
see
began
val
but
something
in
her
face
stopped
him
i
say
he
said
you
do
mean
yes
i
have
to
go
to
the
court
this
already
business
which
he
had
almost
succeeded
in
forgetting
since
nobody
ever
mentioned
it
in
he
stood
picking
little
bits
of
skin
off
his
fingers
then
noticing
that
his
mother
lips
were
all
awry
he
said
impulsively
all
right
mother
i
come
the
brutes
what
brutes
he
did
not
know
but
the
expression
exactly
summed
up
their
joint
feeling
and
restored
a
measure
of
equanimity
i
suppose
i
better
change
into
a
he
muttered
escaping
to
his
room
he
put
on
the
a
higher
collar
a
pearl
pin
and
his
neatest
grey
spats
to
a
somewhat
blasphemous
accompaniment
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
said
well
i
damned
if
i
going
to
show
anything
and
went
down
he
found
his
grandfather
carriage
at
the
door
and
his
mother
in
furs
with
the
appearance
of
one
going
to
a
mansion
house
assembly
they
seated
themselves
side
by
side
in
the
closed
barouche
and
all
the
way
to
the
courts
of
justice
val
made
but
one
allusion
to
the
business
in
hand
there
be
nothing
about
those
pearls
will
there
the
little
tufted
white
tails
of
winifred
muff
began
to
shiver
oh
no
she
said
it
be
quite
harmless
your
grandmother
wanted
to
come
too
but
i
would
let
her
i
thought
you
could
take
care
of
me
you
look
so
nice
val
just
pull
your
coat
collar
up
a
little
more
at
the
if
they
bully
you
began
val
oh
they
wo
i
shall
be
very
cool
it
the
only
they
wo
want
me
to
give
evidence
or
anything
no
dear
it
all
and
she
patted
his
hand
the
determined
front
she
was
putting
on
it
stayed
the
turmoil
in
val
chest
and
he
busied
himself
in
drawing
his
gloves
off
and
on
he
had
taken
what
he
now
saw
was
the
wrong
pair
to
go
with
his
spats
they
should
have
been
grey
but
were
deerskin
of
a
dark
tan
whether
to
keep
them
on
or
not
he
could
not
decide
they
arrived
soon
after
ten
it
was
his
first
visit
to
the
law
courts
and
the
building
struck
him
at
once
by
jove
he
said
as
they
passed
into
the
hall
this
make
four
or
five
jolly
good
racket
soames
was
awaiting
them
at
the
foot
of
some
stairs
here
you
are
he
said
without
shaking
hands
as
if
the
event
had
made
them
too
familiar
for
such
formalities
it
happerly
browne
court
i
we
shall
be
on
a
sensation
such
as
he
had
known
when
going
in
to
bat
was
playing
now
in
the
top
of
val
chest
but
he
followed
his
mother
and
uncle
doggedly
looking
at
no
more
than
he
could
help
and
thinking
that
the
place
smelled
people
seemed
to
be
lurking
everywhere
and
he
plucked
soames
by
the
sleeve
i
say
uncle
you
not
going
to
let
those
beastly
papers
in
are
you
soames
gave
him
the
sideway
look
which
had
reduced
many
to
silence
in
its
time
in
here
he
said
you
need
take
off
your
furs
val
entered
behind
them
nettled
and
with
his
head
up
in
this
confounded
hole
there
were
a
good
many
of
sitting
on
everybody
else
knee
though
really
divided
from
each
other
by
pews
and
val
had
a
feeling
that
they
might
all
slip
down
together
into
the
well
this
however
was
but
a
momentary
mahogany
and
black
gowns
and
white
blobs
of
wigs
and
faces
and
papers
all
rather
secret
and
he
was
sitting
next
his
mother
in
the
front
row
with
his
back
to
it
all
glad
of
her
violette
de
parme
and
taking
off
his
gloves
for
the
last
time
his
mother
was
looking
at
him
he
was
suddenly
conscious
that
she
had
really
wanted
him
there
next
to
her
and
that
he
counted
for
something
in
this
business
all
right
he
would
show
them
squaring
his
shoulders
he
crossed
his
legs
and
gazed
inscrutably
at
his
spats
but
just
then
an
in
a
gown
and
long
wig
looking
awfully
like
a
funny
raddled
woman
came
through
a
door
into
the
high
pew
opposite
and
he
had
to
uncross
his
legs
hastily
and
stand
up
with
everybody
else
versus
dartie
it
seemed
to
val
unspeakably
disgusting
to
have
one
name
called
out
like
this
in
public
and
suddenly
conscious
that
someone
nearly
behind
him
had
begun
talking
about
his
family
he
screwed
his
face
round
to
see
an
old
buffer
who
spoke
as
if
he
were
eating
his
own
old
cuss
the
sort
of
man
he
had
seen
once
or
twice
dining
at
park
lane
and
punishing
the
port
he
knew
now
where
they
them
up
all
the
same
he
found
the
old
buffer
quite
fascinating
and
would
have
continued
to
stare
if
his
mother
had
not
touched
his
arm
reduced
to
gazing
before
him
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
judge
face
instead
why
should
that
old
with
his
sarcastic
mouth
and
his
eyes
have
the
power
to
meddle
with
their
private
he
affairs
of
his
own
just
as
many
and
probably
just
as
nasty
and
there
moved
in
val
like
an
illness
all
the
individualism
of
his
breed
the
voice
behind
him
droned
along
differences
about
money
of
the
respondent
what
a
word
was
that
his
father
strained
absences
on
the
part
of
dartie
my
client
very
rightly
your
ludship
will
agree
was
anxious
to
check
a
lead
to
at
cards
and
on
the
right
thought
val
it
on
crisis
early
in
october
when
the
respondent
wrote
her
this
letter
from
his
val
sat
up
and
his
ears
burned
i
propose
to
read
it
with
the
emendations
necessary
to
the
epistle
of
a
gentleman
who
has
we
say
dining
me
lud
brute
thought
val
flushing
deeper
not
paid
to
make
jokes
will
not
get
the
chance
to
insult
me
again
in
my
own
house
i
am
leaving
the
country
it
played
expression
your
ludship
not
unknown
in
the
mouths
of
those
who
have
not
met
with
conspicuous
owls
thought
val
and
his
flush
deepened
am
tired
of
being
insulted
by
you
my
client
will
tell
your
ludship
that
these
insults
consisted
in
her
calling
him
limit
very
mild
expression
i
venture
to
suggest
in
all
the
val
glanced
sideways
at
his
mother
impassive
face
it
had
a
hunted
look
in
the
eyes
mother
he
thought
and
touched
her
arm
with
his
own
the
voice
behind
droned
on
am
going
to
live
a
new
life
and
next
day
me
lud
the
respondent
left
by
the
steamship
tuscarora
for
buenos
aires
since
then
we
have
nothing
from
him
but
a
cabled
refusal
in
answer
to
the
letter
which
my
client
wrote
the
following
day
in
great
distress
begging
him
to
return
to
her
with
your
permission
i
shall
now
put
dartie
in
the
when
his
mother
rose
val
had
a
tremendous
impulse
to
rise
too
and
say
here
i
going
to
see
you
jolly
well
treat
her
decently
he
subdued
it
however
heard
her
saying
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
looked
up
she
made
a
rich
figure
of
it
in
her
furs
and
large
hat
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
calm
and
he
felt
proud
of
her
thus
confronting
all
these
lawyers
the
examination
began
knowing
that
this
was
only
the
preliminary
to
divorce
val
followed
with
a
certain
glee
the
questions
framed
so
as
to
give
the
impression
that
she
really
wanted
his
father
back
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
old
bagwigs
finely
and
he
received
a
most
unpleasant
jar
when
the
judge
said
suddenly
now
why
did
your
husband
leave
because
you
called
him
limit
you
know
val
saw
his
uncle
lift
his
eyes
to
the
witness
box
without
moving
his
face
heard
a
shuffle
of
papers
behind
him
and
instinct
told
him
that
the
issue
was
in
peril
had
uncle
soames
and
the
old
buffer
behind
made
a
mess
of
it
his
mother
was
speaking
with
a
slight
drawl
no
my
lord
but
it
had
gone
on
a
long
what
had
gone
on
our
differences
about
but
you
supplied
the
money
do
you
suggest
that
he
left
you
to
better
his
position
brute
the
old
brute
and
nothing
but
the
brute
thought
val
suddenly
smells
a
rat
he
trying
to
get
at
the
pastry
and
his
heart
stood
still
he
did
then
of
course
he
would
know
that
his
mother
did
really
want
his
father
back
his
mother
spoke
again
a
thought
more
fashionably
no
my
lord
but
you
see
i
had
refused
to
give
him
any
more
money
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
believe
that
but
he
did
at
when
he
did
i
see
you
had
refused
but
you
sent
him
some
my
lord
i
wanted
him
and
you
thought
that
would
bring
him
i
do
know
my
lord
i
acted
on
my
father
something
in
the
judge
face
in
the
sound
of
the
papers
behind
him
in
the
sudden
crossing
of
his
uncle
legs
told
val
that
she
had
made
just
the
right
answer
he
thought
jove
what
humbug
it
all
is
the
judge
was
speaking
just
one
more
question
dartie
are
you
still
fond
of
your
husband
val
hands
slack
behind
him
became
fists
what
business
had
that
judge
to
make
things
human
suddenly
to
make
his
mother
speak
out
of
her
heart
and
say
what
perhaps
she
did
know
herself
before
all
these
people
it
was
decent
his
mother
answered
rather
low
yes
my
val
saw
the
judge
nod
i
could
take
a
at
your
head
he
thought
irreverently
as
his
mother
came
back
to
her
seat
beside
him
witnesses
to
his
father
departure
and
continued
absence
of
their
own
maids
even
which
struck
val
as
particularly
beastly
there
was
more
talking
all
humbug
and
then
the
judge
pronounced
the
decree
for
restitution
and
they
got
up
to
go
val
walked
out
behind
his
mother
chin
squared
eyelids
drooped
doing
his
level
best
to
despise
everybody
his
mother
voice
in
the
corridor
roused
him
from
an
angry
trance
you
behaved
beautifully
dear
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
have
you
your
uncle
and
i
are
going
to
all
right
said
val
i
shall
have
time
to
go
and
see
that
and
parting
from
them
abruptly
he
ran
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
air
he
bolted
into
a
hansom
and
drove
to
the
goat
club
his
thoughts
were
on
holly
and
what
he
must
do
before
her
brother
showed
her
this
thing
in
paper
when
val
had
left
them
soames
and
winifred
made
their
way
to
the
cheshire
cheese
he
had
suggested
it
as
a
meeting
place
with
bellby
at
that
early
hour
of
noon
they
would
have
it
to
themselves
and
winifred
had
thought
it
would
be
to
see
this
hostelry
having
ordered
a
light
repast
to
the
consternation
of
the
waiter
they
awaited
its
arrival
together
with
that
of
bellby
in
silent
reaction
after
the
hour
and
a
half
suspense
on
the
tenterhooks
of
publicity
bellby
entered
presently
preceded
by
his
nose
as
cheerful
as
they
were
glum
well
they
had
got
the
decree
of
restitution
and
what
was
the
matter
with
that
quite
said
soames
in
a
suitably
low
voice
but
we
shall
have
to
begin
again
to
get
evidence
he
probably
try
the
will
look
fishy
if
it
comes
out
that
we
knew
of
misconduct
from
the
start
his
questions
showed
well
enough
that
he
does
like
this
restitution
pho
said
bellby
cheerily
he
forget
why
man
he
have
tried
a
hundred
cases
between
now
and
then
besides
he
bound
by
precedent
to
give
ye
your
divorce
if
the
evidence
is
satisfactory
we
wo
let
um
know
that
dartie
had
knowledge
of
the
facts
dreamer
did
it
very
got
a
fatherly
touch
about
um
soames
nodded
and
i
compliment
ye
dartie
went
on
bellby
ye
a
natural
gift
for
giving
evidence
steady
as
a
here
the
waiter
arrived
with
three
plates
balanced
on
one
arm
and
the
remark
i
up
the
pudden
sir
you
find
plenty
o
lark
in
it
bellby
applauded
his
forethought
with
a
dip
of
his
nose
but
soames
and
winifred
looked
with
dismay
at
their
light
lunch
of
gravified
brown
masses
touching
them
gingerly
with
their
forks
in
the
hope
of
distinguishing
the
bodies
of
the
tasty
little
having
begun
however
they
found
they
were
hungrier
than
they
thought
and
finished
the
lot
with
a
glass
of
port
apiece
conversation
turned
on
the
war
soames
thought
ladysmith
would
fall
and
it
might
last
a
year
bellby
thought
it
would
be
over
by
the
summer
both
agreed
that
they
wanted
more
men
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
complete
victory
since
it
was
now
a
question
of
prestige
winifred
brought
things
back
to
more
solid
ground
by
saying
that
she
did
not
want
the
divorce
suit
to
come
on
till
after
the
summer
holidays
had
begun
at
oxford
then
the
boys
would
have
forgotten
about
it
before
val
had
to
go
up
again
the
london
season
too
would
be
over
the
lawyers
reassured
her
an
interval
of
six
months
was
that
the
earlier
the
better
people
were
now
beginning
to
come
in
and
they
to
the
city
bellby
to
his
chambers
winifred
in
a
hansom
to
park
lane
to
let
her
mother
know
how
she
had
fared
the
issue
had
been
so
satisfactory
on
the
whole
that
it
was
considered
advisable
to
tell
james
who
never
failed
to
say
day
after
day
that
he
did
know
about
winifred
affair
he
could
tell
as
his
sands
ran
out
the
importance
of
mundane
matters
became
increasingly
grave
to
him
as
if
he
were
feeling
must
make
the
most
of
it
and
worry
well
i
shall
soon
have
nothing
to
worry
about
he
received
the
report
grudgingly
it
was
a
way
of
going
about
things
and
he
did
know
but
he
gave
winifred
a
cheque
saying
i
expect
you
have
a
lot
of
expense
that
a
new
hat
you
got
on
why
does
val
come
and
see
us
winifred
promised
to
bring
him
to
dinner
soon
and
going
home
she
sought
her
bedroom
where
she
could
be
alone
now
that
her
husband
had
been
ordered
back
into
her
custody
with
a
view
to
putting
him
away
from
her
for
ever
she
would
try
once
more
to
find
out
from
her
sore
and
lonely
heart
what
she
really
wanted
chapter
challenge
the
morning
had
been
misty
verging
on
frost
but
the
sun
came
out
while
val
was
jogging
towards
the
roehampton
gate
whence
he
would
canter
on
to
the
usual
tryst
his
spirits
were
rising
rapidly
there
had
been
nothing
so
very
terrible
in
the
morning
proceedings
beyond
the
general
disgrace
of
violated
privacy
we
were
engaged
he
thought
happens
would
matter
he
felt
indeed
like
human
society
which
kicks
and
clamours
at
the
results
of
matrimony
and
hastens
to
get
married
and
he
galloped
over
the
grass
of
richmond
park
fearing
to
be
late
but
again
he
was
alone
at
the
trysting
spot
and
this
second
defection
on
the
part
of
holly
upset
him
dreadfully
he
could
not
go
back
without
seeing
her
emerging
from
the
park
he
proceeded
towards
robin
hill
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
for
whom
to
ask
suppose
her
father
were
back
or
her
sister
or
brother
were
in
he
decided
to
gamble
and
ask
for
them
all
first
so
that
if
he
were
in
luck
and
they
were
not
there
it
would
be
quite
natural
in
the
end
to
ask
for
holly
while
if
any
of
them
were
for
a
ride
must
be
his
saving
grace
only
miss
holly
is
in
oh
thanks
might
i
take
my
horse
round
to
the
stables
and
would
you
cousin
val
when
he
returned
she
was
in
the
hall
very
flushed
and
shy
she
led
him
to
the
far
end
and
they
sat
down
on
a
wide
i
been
awfully
anxious
said
val
in
a
low
voice
what
the
matter
jolly
knows
about
our
is
he
in
no
but
i
expect
he
will
be
then
cried
val
and
diving
forward
he
seized
her
hand
she
tried
to
withdraw
it
failed
gave
up
the
attempt
and
looked
at
him
wistfully
first
of
all
he
said
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
my
family
my
dad
you
know
is
mean
he
left
my
mother
and
they
trying
to
divorce
him
so
they
ordered
him
to
come
back
you
see
you
see
that
in
the
paper
her
eyes
deepened
in
colour
and
fearful
interest
her
hand
squeezed
his
but
the
gambler
in
val
was
roused
now
and
he
hurried
on
of
course
there
nothing
very
much
at
present
but
there
will
be
i
expect
before
it
over
divorce
suits
are
beastly
you
know
i
wanted
to
tell
you
ought
to
and
he
began
to
stammer
gazing
at
her
troubled
eyes
you
going
to
be
a
darling
and
love
me
holly
i
love
so
and
i
want
to
be
he
had
done
it
in
a
manner
so
inadequate
that
he
could
have
punched
his
own
head
and
dropping
on
his
knees
he
tried
to
get
nearer
to
that
soft
troubled
face
you
do
love
you
if
you
i
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
suspense
so
awful
that
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
far
out
on
the
lawn
pretending
there
was
grass
to
cut
then
she
swayed
forward
her
free
hand
touched
his
hair
and
he
gasped
oh
holly
her
answer
was
very
soft
oh
val
he
had
dreamed
of
this
moment
but
always
in
an
imperative
mood
as
the
masterful
young
lover
and
now
he
felt
humble
touched
trembly
he
was
afraid
to
stir
off
his
knees
lest
he
should
break
the
spell
lest
if
he
did
she
should
shrink
and
deny
her
own
tremulous
was
she
in
his
grasp
with
her
eyelids
closed
and
his
lips
nearing
them
her
eyes
opened
seemed
to
swim
a
little
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
suddenly
he
sprang
up
there
had
been
footsteps
a
sort
of
startled
grunt
he
looked
round
no
one
but
the
long
curtains
which
barred
off
the
outer
hall
were
quivering
my
god
who
was
that
holly
too
was
on
her
feet
jolly
i
expect
she
whispered
val
clenched
fists
and
resolution
all
right
he
said
i
do
care
a
bit
now
we
engaged
and
striding
towards
the
curtains
he
drew
them
aside
there
at
the
fireplace
in
the
hall
stood
jolly
with
his
back
elaborately
turned
val
went
forward
jolly
faced
round
on
him
i
beg
your
pardon
for
hearing
he
said
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
val
could
not
help
admiring
him
at
that
moment
his
face
was
clear
his
voice
quiet
he
looked
somehow
distinguished
as
if
acting
up
to
principle
well
val
said
abruptly
it
nothing
to
oh
said
jolly
you
come
this
way
and
he
crossed
the
hall
val
followed
at
the
study
door
he
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
holly
voice
said
i
coming
no
said
jolly
yes
said
holly
jolly
opened
the
door
and
they
all
three
went
in
once
in
the
little
room
they
stood
in
a
sort
of
triangle
on
three
corners
of
the
worn
turkey
carpet
awkwardly
upright
not
looking
at
each
other
quite
incapable
of
seeing
any
humour
in
the
situation
val
broke
the
silence
holly
and
i
are
jolly
stepped
back
and
leaned
against
the
lintel
of
the
window
this
is
our
house
he
said
i
not
going
to
insult
you
in
it
but
my
father
away
i
in
charge
of
my
sister
you
taken
advantage
of
me
i
did
mean
to
said
val
hotly
i
think
you
did
said
jolly
if
you
had
meant
to
you
have
spoken
to
me
or
waited
for
my
father
to
come
there
were
reasons
said
val
what
reasons
about
my
just
told
her
i
wanted
her
to
know
before
things
jolly
suddenly
became
less
distinguished
you
kids
he
said
and
you
know
you
are
i
am
not
a
kid
said
val
you
not
well
what
are
you
i
am
twenty
said
jolly
only
just
anyway
i
as
good
a
man
as
jolly
face
crimsoned
then
clouded
some
struggle
was
evidently
taking
place
in
him
and
val
and
holly
stared
at
him
so
clearly
was
that
struggle
marked
they
could
even
hear
him
breathing
then
his
face
cleared
up
and
became
oddly
resolute
we
see
that
he
said
i
dare
you
to
do
what
i
going
to
dare
me
jolly
smiled
yes
he
said
dare
you
and
i
know
very
well
you
a
stab
of
misgiving
shot
through
val
this
was
riding
very
blind
i
have
forgotten
that
you
a
said
jolly
slowly
and
i
think
that
about
all
you
are
or
that
you
called
me
a
val
heard
a
gasp
above
the
sound
of
his
own
hard
breathing
and
saw
holly
face
poked
a
little
forward
very
pale
with
big
eyes
yes
went
on
jolly
with
a
sort
of
smile
we
shall
soon
see
i
going
to
join
the
imperial
yeomanry
and
i
dare
you
to
do
the
same
val
val
head
jerked
on
its
stem
it
was
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
so
utterly
unthought
of
so
extreme
and
ugly
in
the
midst
of
his
dreaming
and
he
looked
at
holly
with
eyes
grown
suddenly
touchingly
haggard
sit
down
said
jolly
take
your
time
think
it
over
and
he
himself
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
his
grandfather
chair
val
did
not
sit
down
he
stood
with
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
clenched
and
quivering
the
full
awfulness
of
this
decision
one
way
or
the
other
knocked
at
his
mind
with
double
knocks
as
of
an
angry
postman
if
he
did
not
take
that
he
was
disgraced
in
holly
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
that
young
enemy
her
brute
of
a
brother
yet
if
he
took
it
ah
then
all
would
face
her
eyes
her
hair
her
kisses
just
begun
take
your
time
said
jolly
again
i
do
want
to
be
and
they
both
looked
at
holly
she
had
recoiled
against
the
bookshelves
reaching
to
the
ceiling
her
dark
head
leaned
against
gibbon
roman
empire
her
eyes
in
a
sort
of
soft
grey
agony
were
fixed
on
val
and
he
who
had
not
much
gift
of
insight
had
suddenly
a
gleam
of
vision
she
would
be
proud
of
her
enemy
she
would
be
ashamed
of
him
his
hands
came
out
of
his
pockets
as
if
lifted
by
a
spring
all
right
he
said
done
holly
it
was
queer
he
saw
her
flush
start
forward
he
had
done
the
right
face
was
shining
with
wistful
admiration
jolly
stood
up
and
made
a
little
bow
as
who
should
say
passed
then
he
said
we
go
recovering
from
the
impetus
which
had
carried
him
to
that
decision
val
looked
at
him
maliciously
from
under
his
lashes
right
he
thought
to
you
i
shall
have
to
i
get
back
on
you
somehow
and
he
said
with
dignity
i
shall
be
we
meet
at
the
main
recruiting
office
then
said
jolly
at
twelve
and
opening
the
window
he
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
conforming
to
the
creed
which
had
made
him
retire
when
he
surprised
them
in
the
hall
the
confusion
in
the
mind
of
val
thus
left
alone
with
her
for
whom
he
had
paid
this
sudden
price
was
extreme
the
mood
of
was
still
however
uppermost
one
must
do
the
wretched
thing
with
an
air
we
shall
get
plenty
of
riding
and
shooting
anyway
he
said
one
and
it
gave
him
a
sort
of
grim
pleasure
to
hear
the
sigh
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
oh
the
war
soon
be
over
he
said
perhaps
we
sha
even
have
to
go
out
i
do
care
except
for
he
would
be
out
of
the
way
of
that
beastly
divorce
it
was
an
he
felt
her
warm
hand
slip
into
his
jolly
thought
he
had
stopped
their
loving
each
other
did
he
he
held
her
tightly
round
the
waist
looking
at
her
softly
through
his
lashes
smiling
to
cheer
her
up
promising
to
come
down
and
see
her
soon
feeling
somehow
six
inches
taller
and
much
more
in
command
of
her
than
he
had
ever
dared
feel
before
many
times
he
kissed
her
before
he
mounted
and
rode
back
to
town
so
swiftly
on
the
least
provocation
does
the
possessive
instinct
flourish
and
grow
chapter
at
dinner
parties
were
not
now
given
at
james
in
park
every
house
the
moment
comes
when
master
or
mistress
is
no
longer
to
it
no
more
can
nine
courses
be
served
to
twenty
mouths
above
twenty
fine
white
expanses
nor
does
the
household
cat
any
longer
wonder
why
she
is
suddenly
shut
up
so
with
something
like
excitement
at
seventy
would
still
have
liked
a
little
feast
and
fashion
now
and
dinner
for
six
instead
of
two
herself
wrote
a
number
of
foreign
words
on
cards
and
arranged
the
from
the
riviera
and
white
roman
hyacinths
not
from
rome
there
would
only
be
of
course
james
and
herself
soames
winifred
val
and
she
liked
to
pretend
a
little
and
dally
in
imagination
with
the
glory
of
the
past
she
so
dressed
herself
that
james
remarked
what
are
you
putting
on
that
thing
for
you
catch
but
emily
knew
that
the
necks
of
women
are
protected
by
love
of
shining
unto
fourscore
years
and
she
only
answered
let
me
put
you
on
one
of
those
dickies
i
got
you
james
then
only
have
to
change
your
trousers
and
put
on
your
velvet
coat
and
there
you
be
val
likes
you
to
look
dicky
said
james
you
always
wasting
your
money
on
but
he
suffered
the
change
to
be
made
till
his
neck
also
shone
murmuring
vaguely
he
an
extravagant
chap
i
a
little
brighter
in
the
eye
with
rather
more
colour
than
usual
in
his
cheeks
he
took
his
seat
in
the
to
wait
for
the
sound
of
the
bell
i
made
it
a
proper
dinner
party
emily
said
comfortably
i
thought
it
would
be
good
practice
for
must
get
used
to
it
now
coming
james
uttered
an
indeterminate
sound
thinking
of
imogen
as
she
used
to
climb
about
his
knee
or

muttered

said
emily
she

to
make
a
good
there

murmured
james
she
much
better
stay
at
home
and
look
after
her
a
second
dartie
carrying
off
his
pretty
granddaughter
would
finish
him
he
had
never
quite
forgiven
emily
for
having
been
as
much
taken
in
by
montague
dartie
as
he
himself
had
been
where
warmson
he
said
suddenly
i
should
like
a
glass
of
madeira
there
champagne
james
shook
his
head
no
body
he
said
i
ca

any
good
out
of
emily
reached
forward
on
her
side
of
the
fire
and
rang
the
bell
your
master
would
like
a
bottle
of
madeira
opened
no
no
said
james
the
tips
of
his
ears
quivering
with
vehemence
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
an
object
seen
by
him
alone
look
here
warmson
you
go
to
the
inner
cellar
and
on
the
middle
shelf
of
the
end
bin
on
the
left
you
see
seven
bottles
take
the
one
in
the
centre
and
shake
it
it
the
last
of
the
madeira
i
had
from
jolyon
when
we
came
in
been
moved
it
ought
to
be
in
prime
condition
still
but
i
do
know
i
ca
very
good
sir
responded
the
withdrawing
warmson
i
was
keeping
it
for
our
golden
wedding
said
james
suddenly
but
i
sha
live
three
years
at
my
nonsense
james
said
emily
do
talk
like
i
ought
to
have
got
it
up
myself
murmured
james
he
shake
it
as
likely
as
and
he
sank
into
silent
recollection
of
long
moments
among
the
open
the
cobwebs
and
the
good
smell
of
corks
which
had
been
appetiser
to
so
many
feasts
in
the
wine
from
that
cellar
was
written
the
history
of
the
forty
odd
years
since
he
had
come
to
the
park
lane
house
with
his
young
bride
and
of
the
many
generations
of
friends
and
acquaintances
who
had
passed
into
the
unknown
its
depleted
bins
preserved
the
record
of
family
the
marriages
births
deaths
of
his
kith
and
kin
and
when
he
was
gone
there
it
would
be
and
he
did
know
what
would
become
of
it
it
be
drunk
or
spoiled
he
should
wonder
from
that
deep
reverie
the
entrance
of
his
son
dragged
him
followed
very
soon
by
that
of
winifred
and
her
two
eldest
they
went
down
with
imogen
the
debutante
because
his
pretty
grandchild
cheered
him
soames
with
winifred
emily
with
val
whose
eyes
lighting
on
the
oysters
brightened
this
was
to
be
a
proper
full
with
and
port
and
he
felt
in
need
of
it
after
what
he
had
done
that
day
as
yet
undivulged
after
the
first
glass
or
two
it
became
pleasant
to
have
this
bombshell
up
his
sleeve
this
piece
of
sensational
patriotism
or
example
rather
of
personal
daring
to
his
pleasure
in
what
he
had
done
for
his
queen
and
country
was
so
far
entirely
personal
he
was
now
a
indissolubly
connected
with
guns
and
horses
he
had
a
right
to
of
course
that
he
was
going
to
he
should
just
announce
it
quietly
when
there
was
a
pause
and
glancing
down
the
menu
he
determined
on
aux
fraises
as
the
proper
moment
there
would
be
a
certain
solemnity
while
they
were
eating
that
once
or
twice
before
they
reached
that
rosy
summit
of
the
dinner
he
was
attacked
by
remembrance
that
his
grandfather
was
never
told
anything
still
the
old
boy
was
drinking
madeira
and
looking
jolly
fit
besides
he
ought
to
be
pleased
at
this
to
the
disgrace
of
the
divorce
the
sight
of
his
uncle
opposite
too
was
a
sharp
incentive
he
was
so
far
from
being
a
sportsman
that
it
would
be
worth
a
lot
to
see
his
face
besides
better
to
tell
his
mother
in
this
way
than
privately
which
might
upset
them
both
he
was
sorry
for
her
but
after
all
one
could
be
expected
to
feel
much
for
others
when
one
had
to
part
from
holly
his
grandfather
voice
travelled
to
him
thinly
val
try
a
little
of
the
madeira
with
your
ice
you
wo
get
that
up
at
val
watched
the
slow
liquid
filling
his
glass
the
essential
oil
of
the
old
wine
glazing
the
surface
inhaled
its
aroma
and
thought
for
it
it
was
a
rich
moment
he
sipped
and
a
gentle
glow
spread
in
his
veins
already
heated
with
a
rapid
look
round
he
said
i
joined
the
imperial
yeomanry
granny
and
emptied
his
glass
as
though
drinking
the
health
of
his
own
act
what
it
was
his
mother
desolate
little
word
young
jolly
forsyte
and
i
went
down
there
you
did
sign
from
uncle
soames
rather
we
go
into
camp
on
i
say
cried
imogen
all
looked
at
james
he
was
leaning
forward
with
his
hand
behind
his
ear
what
that
he
said
what
he
saying
i
ca
emily
reached
forward
to
pat
val
hand
it
only
that
val
has
joined
the
yeomanry
james
it
very
nice
for
him
he
look
his
best
in
joined
came
from
james
tremulously
loud
you
ca
see
two
yards
before
your
nose
have
to
go
out
there
why
he
be
fighting
before
he
knows
where
he
val
saw
imogen
eyes
admiring
him
and
his
mother
still
and
fashionable
with
her
handkerchief
before
her
lips
suddenly
his
uncle
spoke
you
under
i
thought
of
that
smiled
val
i
gave
my
age
as
he
heard
his
grandmother
admiring
well
val
that
was
plucky
of
you
was
conscious
of
warmson
deferentially
filling
his
champagne
glass
and
of
his
grandfather
voice
moaning
i
do
know
become
of
you
if
you
go
on
like
imogen
was
patting
his
shoulder
his
uncle
looking
at
him
sidelong
only
his
mother
sat
unmoving
till
affected
by
her
stillness
val
said
it
all
right
you
know
we
shall
soon
have
them
on
the
run
i
only
hope
i
shall
come
in
for
he
felt
elated
sorry
tremendously
important
all
at
once
this
would
show
uncle
soames
and
all
the
forsytes
how
to
be
sportsmen
he
had
certainly
done
something
heroic
and
exceptional
in
giving
his
age
as
emily
voice
brought
him
back
to
earth
you
must
have
a
second
glass
james
warmson
wo
they
be
astonished
at
timothy
burst
out
imogen
i
give
anything
to
see
their
faces
do
you
have
a
sword
val
or
only
a
popgun
what
made
you
his
uncle
voice
produced
a
slight
chill
in
the
pit
of
val
stomach
made
him
how
answer
that
he
was
grateful
for
his
comfortable
well
i
think
it
very
plucky
of
val
i
sure
he
make
a
splendid
soldier
he
just
the
figure
for
it
we
shall
all
be
proud
of
what
had
young
jolly
forsyte
to
do
with
it
why
did
you
go
together
pursued
soames
uncannily
relentless
i
thought
you
were
friendly
with
him
i
not
mumbled
val
but
i
was
going
to
be
beaten
by
he
saw
his
uncle
look
at
him
quite
differently
as
if
approving
his
grandfather
was
nodding
too
his
grandmother
tossing
her
head
they
all
approved
of
his
not
being
beaten
by
that
cousin
of
his
there
must
be
a
reason
val
was
dimly
conscious
of
some
disturbing
point
outside
his
range
of
vision
as
it
might
be
the
unlocated
centre
of
a
cyclone
and
staring
at
his
uncle
face
he
had
a
quite
unaccountable
vision
of
a
woman
with
dark
eyes
gold
hair
and
a
white
neck
who
smelt
nice
and
had
pretty
silken
clothes
which
he
had
liked
feeling
when
he
was
quite
small
by
jove
yes
aunt
irene
she
used
to
kiss
him
and
he
had
bitten
her
arm
once
playfully
because
he
liked
soft
his
grandfather
was
speaking
what
his
father
doing
he
away
in
paris
val
said
staring
at
the
very
queer
expression
on
his
uncle
face
that
of
a
snarling
dog
artists
said
james
the
word
coming
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
soul
broke
up
the
dinner
opposite
his
mother
in
the
cab
going
home
val
tasted
the
of
heroism
like
medlars
she
only
said
indeed
that
he
must
go
to
his
tailor
at
once
and
have
his
uniform
properly
made
and
not
just
put
up
with
what
they
gave
him
but
he
could
feel
that
she
was
very
much
upset
it
was
on
his
lips
to
console
her
with
the
spoken
thought
that
he
would
be
out
of
the
way
of
that
beastly
divorce
but
the
presence
of
imogen
and
the
knowledge
that
his
mother
would
not
be
out
of
the
way
restrained
him
he
felt
aggrieved
that
she
did
not
seem
more
proud
of
him
when
imogen
had
gone
to
bed
he
risked
the
emotional
i
awfully
sorry
to
have
to
leave
you
well
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
we
must
try
and
get
you
a
commission
as
soon
as
we
can
then
you
wo
have
to
rough
it
so
do
you
know
any
drill
val
not
a
i
hope
they
wo
worry
you
much
i
must
take
you
about
to
get
the
things
kiss
with
that
kiss
soft
and
hot
between
his
eyes
and
those
words
hope
they
wo
worry
you
much
in
his
ears
he
sat
down
to
a
cigarette
before
a
dying
fire
the
heat
was
out
of
glow
of
cutting
a
dash
it
was
all
a
damned
bore
be
even
with
that
chap
jolly
he
thought
trailing
up
the
stairs
past
the
room
where
his
mother
was
biting
her
pillow
to
smother
a
sense
of
desolation
which
was
trying
to
make
her
sob
and
soon
only
one
of
the
diners
at
james
was
in
his
bedroom
above
his
father
so
that
fellow
jolyon
was
in
was
he
doing
there
hanging
round
irene
the
last
report
from
polteed
had
hinted
that
there
might
be
something
soon
could
it
be
this
that
fellow
with
his
beard
and
his
cursed
amused
way
of
of
the
old
man
who
had
given
him
the
nickname
of
property
and
bought
the
fatal
house
from
him
soames
had
ever
resented
having
had
to
sell
the
house
at
robin
hill
never
forgiven
his
uncle
for
having
bought
it
or
his
cousin
for
living
in
it
reckless
of
the
cold
he
threw
his
window
up
and
gazed
out
across
the
park
bleak
and
dark
the
january
night
little
sound
of
traffic
a
frost
coming
bare
trees
a
star
or
two
see
polteed
he
thought
god
i
mad
i
think
to
want
her
still
that
fellow
if
um
no
chapter
of
the
dog
balthasar
jolyon
who
had
crossed
from
calais
by
night
arrived
at
robin
hill
on
sunday
morning
he
had
sent
no
word
beforehand
so
walked
up
from
the
station
entering
his
domain
by
the
coppice
gate
coming
to
the
log
seat
fashioned
out
of
an
old
fallen
trunk
he
sat
down
first
laying
his
overcoat
on
it
he
thought
what
love
ends
in
at
my
time
of
life
and
suddenly
irene
seemed
very
near
just
as
she
had
been
that
day
of
rambling
at
fontainebleau
when
they
had
sat
on
a
log
to
eat
their
lunch
hauntingly
near
odour
drawn
out
of
fallen
leaves
by
the
sunlight
soaked
his
nostrils
glad
it
is
spring
he
thought
with
the
scent
of
sap
and
the
song
of
birds
and
the
bursting
of
the
blossoms
it
would
have
been
unbearable
hope
i
shall
be
over
it
by
then
old
fool
that
i
am
and
picking
up
his
coat
he
walked
on
into
the
field
he
passed
the
pond
and
mounted
the
hill
slowly
near
the
top
a
hoarse
barking
greeted
him
up
on
the
lawn
above
the
fernery
he
could
see
his
old
dog
balthasar
the
animal
whose
dim
eyes
took
his
master
for
a
stranger
was
warning
the
world
against
him
jolyon
gave
his
special
whistle
even
at
that
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
and
more
he
could
see
the
dawning
recognition
in
the
obese
body
the
old
dog
got
off
his
haunches
and
his
tail
over
his
back
began
a
feeble
excited
fluttering
he
came
waddling
forward
gathered
momentum
and
disappeared
over
the
edge
of
the
fernery
jolyon
expected
to
meet
him
at
the
wicket
gate
but
balthasar
was
not
there
and
rather
alarmed
he
turned
into
the
fernery
on
his
fat
side
looking
up
with
eyes
already
glazing
the
old
dog
lay
what
is
it
my
poor
old
man
cried
jolyon
balthasar
curled
and
fluffy
tail
just
moved
his
filming
eyes
seemed
saying
i
ca
get
up
master
but
i
glad
to
see
jolyon
knelt
down
his
eyes
very
dimmed
could
hardly
see
the
slowly
ceasing
heave
of
the
dog
side
he
raised
the
head
a
heavy
what
is
it
dear
man
where
are
you
hurt
the
tail
fluttered
once
the
eyes
lost
the
look
of
life
jolyon
passed
his
hands
all
over
the
inert
warm
bulk
there
was
heart
had
simply
failed
in
that
obese
body
from
the
emotion
of
his
master
return
jolyon
could
feel
the
muzzle
where
a
few
whitish
bristles
grew
cooling
already
against
his
lips
he
stayed
for
some
minutes
kneeling
with
his
hand
beneath
the
stiffening
head
the
body
was
very
heavy
when
he
bore
it
to
the
top
of
the
field
leaves
had
drifted
there
and
he
strewed
it
with
a
covering
of
them
there
was
no
wind
and
they
would
keep
him
from
curious
eyes
until
the
afternoon
bury
him
myself
he
thought
eighteen
years
had
gone
since
he
first
went
into
the
john
wood
house
with
that
tiny
puppy
in
his
pocket
strange
that
the
old
dog
should
die
just
now
was
it
an
omen
he
turned
at
the
gate
to
look
back
at
that
russet
mound
then
went
slowly
towards
the
house
very
choky
in
the
throat
june
was
at
home
she
had
come
down
hotfoot
on
hearing
the
news
of
jolly
enlistment
his
patriotism
had
conquered
her
feeling
for
the
boers
the
atmosphere
of
his
house
was
strange
and
pocketty
when
jolyon
came
in
and
told
them
of
the
dog
balthasar
death
the
news
had
a
unifying
effect
a
link
with
the
past
had
dog
balthasar
two
of
them
could
remember
nothing
before
his
day
to
june
he
represented
the
last
years
of
her
grandfather
to
jolyon
that
life
of
domestic
stress
and
aesthetic
struggle
before
he
came
again
into
the
kingdom
of
his
father
love
and
wealth
and
he
was
gone
in
the
afternoon
he
and
jolly
took
picks
and
spades
and
went
out
to
the
field
they
chose
a
spot
close
to
the
russet
mound
so
that
they
need
not
carry
him
far
and
carefully
cutting
off
the
surface
turf
began
to
dig
they
dug
in
silence
for
ten
minutes
and
then
rested
well
old
man
said
jolyon
so
you
thought
you
ought
yes
answered
jolly
i
do
want
to
a
bit
of
how
exactly
those
words
represented
jolyon
own
state
of
mind
i
admire
you
for
it
old
boy
i
do
believe
i
should
have
done
it
at
your
much
of
a
forsyte
i
afraid
but
i
suppose
the
type
gets
thinner
with
each
generation
your
son
if
you
have
one
may
be
a
pure
altruist
who
knows
he
wo
be
like
me
then
dad
i
beastly
no
my
dear
that
you
clearly
are
jolly
shook
his
head
and
they
dug
again
strange
life
a
dog
said
jolyon
suddenly
the
only
with
rudiments
of
altruism
and
a
sense
of
god
jolly
looked
at
his
father
do
you
believe
in
god
dad
i
never
at
so
searching
a
question
from
one
to
whom
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
light
reply
jolyon
stood
for
a
moment
feeling
his
back
tried
by
the
digging
what
do
you
mean
by
god
he
said
there
are
two
irreconcilable
ideas
of
god
there
the
unknowable
creative
believes
in
that
and
there
the
sum
of
altruism
in
one
believes
in
i
see
that
leaves
out
christ
does
it
jolyon
stared
christ
the
link
between
those
two
ideas
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
here
was
orthodoxy
scientifically
explained
at
last
the
sublime
poem
of
the
christ
life
was

attempt
to
join
those
two
irreconcilable
conceptions
of
god
and
since
the
sum
of
human
altruism
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
unknowable
creative
principle
as
anything
else
in
nature
and
the
universe
a
worse
link
might
have
been
chosen
after
all
one
went
through
life
without
seeing
it
in
that
sort
of
way
what
do
you
think
old
man
he
said
jolly
frowned
of
course
my
first
year
we
talked
a
good
bit
about
that
sort
of
thing
but
in
the
second
year
one
gives
it
up
i
do
know
awfully
jolyon
remembered
that
he
also
had
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
his
first
year
at
cambridge
and
given
it
up
in
his
second
i
suppose
said
jolly
it
the
second
god
you
mean
that
old
balthasar
had
a
sense
yes
or
he
would
never
have
burst
his
poor
old
heart
because
of
something
outside
but
was
that
just
selfish
emotion
really
jolyon
shook
his
head
no
dogs
are
not
pure
forsytes
they
love
something
outside
jolly
smiled
well
i
think
i
one
he
said
you
know
i
only
enlisted
because
i
dared
val
dartie
but
why
we
bar
each
other
said
jolly
shortly
ah
muttered
jolyon
so
the
feud
went
on
unto
the
third
modern
feud
which
had
no
overt
expression
i
tell
the
boy
about
it
he
thought
but
to
what
he
had
to
stop
short
of
his
own
part
and
jolly
thought
for
holly
to
let
him
know
about
that
chap
if
she
does
it
means
she
does
want
him
told
and
i
should
be
sneaking
anyway
i
stopped
it
i
better
leave
well
alone
so
they
dug
on
in
silence
till
jolyon
said
now
old
man
i
think
it
big
and
resting
on
their
spades
they
gazed
down
into
the
hole
where
a
few
leaves
had
drifted
already
on
a
sunset
wind
i
ca
bear
this
part
of
it
said
jolyon
suddenly
let
me
do
it
dad
he
never
cared
much
for
jolyon
shook
his
head
we
lift
him
very
gently
leaves
and
all
i
rather
not
see
him
again
i
take
his
head
now
with
extreme
care
they
raised
the
old
dog
body
whose
faded
tan
and
white
showed
here
and
there
under
the
leaves
stirred
by
the
wind
they
laid
it
heavy
cold
and
unresponsive
in
the
grave
and
jolly
spread
more
leaves
over
it
while
jolyon
deeply
afraid
to
show
emotion
before
his
son
began
quickly
shovelling
the
earth
on
to
that
still
shape
there
went
the
past
if
only
there
were
a
joyful
future
to
look
forward
to
it
was
like
stamping
down
earth
on
one
own
life
they
replaced
the
turf
carefully
on
the
smooth
little
mound
and
grateful
that
they
had
spared
each
other
feelings
returned
to
the
house
chapter
stays
the
rot
on
forsyte
news
of
the
enlistment
spread
fast
together
with
the
report
that
june
not
to
be
outdone
was
going
to
become
a
red
cross
nurse
these
events
were
so
extreme
so
subversive
of
pure
forsyteism
as
to
have
a
binding
effect
upon
the
family
and
timothy
was
thronged
next
sunday
afternoon
by
members
trying
to
find
out
what
they
thought
about
it
all
and
exchange
with
each
other
a
sense
of
family
credit
giles
and
jesse
hayman
would
no
longer
defend
the
coast
but
go
to
south
africa
quite
soon
jolly
and
val
would
be
following
in
april
as
to
you
never
knew
what
she
would
really
do
the
retirement
from
spion
kop
and
the
absence
of
any
good
news
from
the
seat
of
war
imparted
an
air
of
reality
to
all
this
clinched
in
startling
fashion
by
timothy
the
youngest
of
the
old
eighty
in
fact
popularly
supposed
to
resemble
their
father
dosset
even
in
his
characteristic
of
drinking
been
invisible
for
so
many
years
that
he
was
almost
mythical
a
long
generation
had
elapsed
since
the
risks
of
a
publisher
business
had
worked
on
his
nerves
at
the
age
of
forty
so
that
he
had
got
out
with
a
mere
thousand
pounds
in
the
world
and
started
to
make
his
living
by
careful
investment
putting
by
every
year
at
compound
interest
he
had
doubled
his
capital
in
forty
years
without
having
once
known
what
it
was
like
to
shake
in
his
shoes
over
money
matters
he
was
now
putting
aside
some
two
thousand
a
year
and
with
the
care
he
was
taking
of
himself
expected
so
aunt
hester
said
to
double
his
capital
again
before
he
died
what
he
would
do
with
it
then
with
his
sisters
dead
and
himself
dead
was
often
mockingly
queried
by
free
spirits
such
as
francie
euphemia
or
young
nicholas
second
christopher
whose
spirit
was
so
free
that
he
had
actually
said
he
was
going
on
the
stage
all
admitted
however
that
this
was
best
known
to
timothy
himself
and
possibly
to
soames
who
never
divulged
a
secret
those
few
forsytes
who
had
seen
him
reported
a
man
of
thick
and
robust
appearance
not
very
tall
with
a
complexion
grey
hair
and
little
of
the
refinement
of
feature
with
which
most
of
the
forsytes
had
been
endowed
by
dosset
wife
a
woman
of
some
beauty
and
a
gentle
temperament
it
was
known
that
he
had
taken
surprising
interest
in
the
war
sticking
flags
into
a
map
ever
since
it
began
and
there
was
uneasiness
as
to
what
would
happen
if
the
english
were
driven
into
the
sea
when
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
him
to
put
the
flags
in
the
right
places
as
to
his
knowledge
of
family
movements
or
his
views
about
them
little
was
known
save
that
aunt
hester
was
always
declaring
that
he
was
very
upset
it
was
then
in
the
nature
of
a
portent
when
forsytes
arriving
on
the
sunday
after
the
evacuation
of
spion
kop
became
conscious
one
after
the
other
of
a
presence
seated
in
the
only
really
comfortable
armchair
back
to
the
light
concealing
the
lower
part
of
his
face
with
a
large
hand
and
were
greeted
by
the
awed
voice
of
aunt
hester
your
uncle
timothy
my
timothy
greeting
to
them
all
was
somewhat
identical
and
rather
as
it
were
passed
over
by
him
than
expressed
how
de
do
how
de
do
me
gettin
up
francie
was
present
and
eustace
had
come
in
his
car
winifred
had
brought
imogen
breaking
the
ice
of
the
restitution
proceedings
with
the
warmth
of
family
appreciation
at
val
enlistment
and
marian
tweetyman
with
the
last
news
of
giles
and
jesse
these
with
aunt
juley
and
hester
young
nicholas
euphemia
all
people
who
had
come
with
eustace
in
the
car
constituted
an
assembly
worthy
of
the
palmiest
days
there
was
not
one
chair
vacant
in
the
whole
of
the
little
and
anxiety
was
felt
lest
someone
else
should
arrive
the
constraint
caused
by
timothy
presence
having
worn
off
a
little
conversation
took
a
military
turn
george
asked
aunt
juley
when
she
was
going
out
with
the
red
cross
almost
reducing
her
to
a
state
of
gaiety
whereon
he
turned
to
nicholas
and
said
young
nick
a
warrior
bold
is
he
when
he
going
to
don
the
wild
khaki
young
nicholas
smiling
with
a
sort
of
sweet
deprecation
intimated
that
of
course
his
mother
was
very
anxious
the
dromios
are
off
i
hear
said
george
turning
to
marian
tweetyman
we
shall
all
be
there
soon
en
avant
the
forsytes
roll
bowl
or
pitch
who
for
a
cooler
aunt
juley
gurgled
george
was
so
droll
should
hester
get
map
then
he
could
show
them
all
where
they
were
at
a
sound
from
timothy
interpreted
as
assent
aunt
hester
left
the
room
george
pursued
his
image
of
the
forsyte
advance
addressing
timothy
as
field
marshal
and
imogen
whom
he
had
noted
at
once
for
pretty
filly
vivandiere
and
holding
his
top
hat
between
his
knees
he
began
to
beat
it
with
imaginary
drumsticks
the
reception
accorded
to
his
fantasy
was
mixed
all
was
licensed
but
all
felt
that
the
family
was
being
and
this
seemed
to
them
unnatural
now
that
it
was
going
to
give
five
of
its
members
to
the
service
of
the
queen
george
might
go
too
far
and
there
was
relief
when
he
got
up
offered
his
arm
to
aunt
juley
marched
up
to
timothy
saluted
him
kissed
his
aunt
with
mock
passion
said
oh
what
a
treat
dear
papa
come
on
eustace
and
walked
out
followed
by
the
grave
and
fastidious
eustace
who
had
never
smiled
aunt
juley
bewildered
fancy
not
waiting
for
the
map
you
mind
him
timothy
he
so
droll
broke
the
hush
and
timothy
removed
the
hand
from
his
mouth
i
do
know
what
things
are
comin
to
he
was
heard
to
say
all
this
about
goin
out
there
that
not
the
way
to
beat
those
francie
alone
had
the
hardihood
to
observe
what
is
then
uncle
timothy
all
this
volunteerin
and
money
out
of
the
just
then
aunt
hester
brought
in
the
map
handling
it
like
a
baby
with
eruptions
with
the
assistance
of
euphemia
it
was
laid
on
the
piano
a
small
colwood
grand
last
played
on
it
was
believed
the
summer
before
aunt
ann
died
thirteen
years
ago
timothy
rose
he
walked
over
to
the
piano
and
stood
looking
at
his
map
while
they
all
gathered
round
there
you
are
he
said
that
the
position
up
to
date
and
very
poor
it
is
h
yes
said
francie
greatly
daring
but
how
are
you
going
to
alter
it
uncle
timothy
without
more
men
men
said
timothy
you
do
want
the
country
money
you
want
a
napoleon
he
settle
it
in
a
but
if
you
have
got
him
uncle
timothy
that
their
business
replied
timothy
what
have
we
kept
the
army
up
eat
their
heads
off
in
time
of
peace
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
comin
on
the
country
to
help
them
like
this
let
every
man
stick
to
his
business
and
we
shall
get
and
looking
round
him
he
added
almost
angrily
volunteerin
indeed
throwin
good
money
after
bad
we
must
save
conserve
energy
that
the
only
and
with
a
prolonged
sound
not
quite
a
sniff
and
not
quite
a
snort
he
trod
on
euphemia
toe
and
went
out
leaving
a
sensation
and
a
faint
scent
of
behind
him
the
effect
of
something
said
with
conviction
by
one
who
has
evidently
made
a
sacrifice
to
say
it
is
ever
considerable
and
the
eight
forsytes
left
behind
all
women
except
young
nicholas
were
silent
for
a
moment
round
the
map
then
francie
said
really
i
think
he
right
you
know
after
all
what
is
the
army
for
they
ought
to
have
known
it
only
encouraging
my
dear
cried
aunt
juley
but
they
been
so
progressive
think
of
their
giving
up
their
scarlet
they
were
always
so
proud
of
it
and
now
they
all
look
like
convicts
hester
and
i
were
saying
only
yesterday
we
were
sure
they
must
feel
it
very
much
fancy
what
the
iron
duke
would
have
said
the
new
colour
very
smart
said
winifred
val
looks
quite
nice
in
aunt
juley
sighed
i
do
so
wonder
what
jolyon
boy
is
like
to
think
we
never
seen
him
his
father
must
be
so
proud
of
his
father
in
paris
said
winifred
aunt
hester
shoulder
was
seen
to
mount
suddenly
as
if
to
ward
off
her
sister
next
remark
for
juley
crumpled
cheeks
had
gushed
we
had
dear
little
macander
here
yesterday
just
back
from
paris
and
whom
think
she
saw
there
in
the
street
you
never
we
sha
try
auntie
said
euphemia
irene
imagine
after
all
this
time
walking
with
a
fair
beard
auntie
you
kill
me
a
fair
beard
i
was
going
to
say
said
aunt
juley
severely
a
gentleman
and
not
a
day
older
she
was
always
so
pretty
she
added
with
a
sort
of
lingering
apology
oh
tell
us
about
her
auntie
cried
imogen
i
can
just
remember
her
she
the
skeleton
in
the
family
cupboard
is
she
and
they
such
aunt
hester
sat
down
really
juley
had
done
it
now
she
was
much
of
a
skeleton
as
i
remember
her
murmured
euphemia
extremely
my
dear
said
aunt
juley
what
a
peculiar
way
of
putting
very
no
but
what
was
she
like
persisted
imogen
i
tell
you
my
child
said
francie
a
kind
of
modern
venus
very
euphemia
said
sharply
venus
was
never
dressed
and
she
had
blue
eyes
of
melting
at
this
juncture
nicholas
took
his
leave
mrs
nick
is
awfully
strict
said
francie
with
a
laugh
she
has
six
children
said
aunt
juley
it
very
proper
she
should
be
was
uncle
soames
awfully
fond
of
her
pursued
the
inexorable
imogen
moving
her
dark
luscious
eyes
from
face
to
face
aunt
hester
made
a
gesture
of
despair
just
as
aunt
juley
answered
yes
your
uncle
soames
was
very
much
attached
to
i
suppose
she
ran
off
with
someone
no
certainly
not
that
precisely
what
did
she
do
then
auntie
come
along
imogen
said
winifred
we
must
be
getting
but
aunt
juley
interjected
resolutely
did
behave
at
all
oh
bother
cried
imogen
that
as
far
as
i
ever
well
my
dear
said
francie
she
had
a
love
affair
which
ended
with
the
young
man
death
and
then
she
left
your
uncle
i
always
rather
liked
she
used
to
give
me
chocolates
murmured
imogen
and
smell
of
course
remarked
euphemia
not
of
course
at
all
replied
francie
who
used
a
particularly
expensive
essence
of
gillyflower
herself
i
ca
think
what
we
are
about
said
aunt
juley
raising
her
hands
talking
of
such
things
was
she
divorced
asked
imogen
from
the
door
certainly
not
cried
aunt
juley
that
a
sound
was
heard
over
by
the
far
door
timothy
had
the
back
i
come
for
my
map
he
said
who
been
divorced
no
one
uncle
replied
francie
with
perfect
truth
timothy
took
his
map
off
the
piano
do
let
have
anything
of
that
sort
in
the
family
he
said
all
this
enlistin
bad
enough
the
country
breakin
up
i
do
know
what
we
comin
he
shook
a
thick
finger
at
the
room
too
many
women
nowadays
and
they
do
know
what
they
so
saying
he
grasped
the
map
firmly
with
both
hands
and
went
out
as
if
afraid
of
being
answered
the
seven
women
whom
he
had
addressed
broke
into
a
subdued
murmur
out
of
which
emerged
francie
really
the
forsytes
and
aunt
juley
he
must
have
his
feet
in
mustard
and
hot
water
hester
will
you
tell
jane
the
blood
has
gone
to
his
head
again
i
afraid
that
evening
when
she
and
hester
were
sitting
alone
after
dinner
she
dropped
a
stitch
in
her
crochet
and
looked
up
hester
i
ca
think
where
i
heard
that
dear
soames
wants
irene
to
come
back
to
him
again
who
was
it
told
us
that
george
had
made
a
funny
drawing
of
him
with
the
words
wo
be
happy
till
he
gets
eustace
answered
aunt
hester
from
behind
the
times
he
had
it
in
his
pocket
but
he
would
show
it
aunt
juley
was
silent
ruminating
the
clock
ticked
the
times
crackled
the
fire
sent
forth
its
rustling
purr
aunt
juley
dropped
another
stitch
hester
she
said
i
have
had
such
a
dreadful
then
do
tell
me
said
aunt
hester
quickly
oh
but
i
must
you
ca
think
how
dreadful
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
they
say
has
a
fair
beard
chapter
of
the
chase
two
days
after
the
dinner
at
james
polteed
provided
soames
with
food
for
thought
a
gentleman
he
said
consulting
the
key
concealed
in
his
left
hand
as
we
say
has
been
paying
marked
attention
to
during
the
last
month
in
paris
but
at
present
there
seems
to
have
been
nothing
very
conclusive
the
meetings
have
all
been
in
public
places
without
the
opera
the
comique
the
louvre
luxembourg
gardens
lounge
of
the
hotel
and
so
forth
she
has
not
yet
been
traced
to
his
rooms
nor
vice
versa
they
went
to
nothing
of
value
in
short
the
situation
is
promising
but
requires
and
looking
up
suddenly
he
added
one
rather
curious
has
the
same
name
fellow
knows
i
her
husband
thought
soames
christian
odd
continued
polteed
we
know
his
address
in
paris
and
his
residence
here
we
do
wish
of
course
to
be
running
a
wrong
go
on
with
it
but
be
careful
said
soames
doggedly
instinctive
certainty
that
this
detective
fellow
had
fathomed
his
secret
made
him
all
the
more
reticent
excuse
me
said
polteed
i
just
see
if
there
anything
fresh
he
returned
with
some
letters
relocking
the
door
he
glanced
at
the
envelopes
yes
here
a
personal
one
from
to
well
said
soames
um
said
polteed
she
says
left
for
england
address
on
his
baggage
robin
hill
parted
from
in
louvre
gallery
at
nothing
very
striking
thought
it
best
to
stay
and
continue
observation
of
you
will
deal
with
in
england
if
you
think
desirable
no
doubt
and
polteed
lifted
an
unprofessional
glance
on
soames
as
though
he
might
be
storing
material
for
a
book
on
human
nature
after
he
had
gone
out
of
business
very
intelligent
woman
and
a
wonderful
not
cheap
but
earns
her
money
well
there
no
suspicion
of
being
shadowed
so
far
but
after
a
time
as
you
know
sensitive
people
are
liable
to
get
the
feeling
of
it
without
anything
definite
to
go
on
i
should
rather
advise
on
and
keeping
an
eye
on
we
ca
get
at
correspondence
without
great
risk
i
hardly
advise
that
at
this
stage
but
you
can
tell
your
client
that
it
looking
up
very
and
again
his
narrowed
eyes
gleamed
at
his
taciturn
customer
no
said
soames
suddenly
i
prefer
that
you
should
keep
the
watch
going
discreetly
in
paris
and
not
concern
yourself
with
this
very
well
replied
polteed
we
can
do
is
the
manner
between
them
i
read
you
what
she
says
said
polteed
unlocking
a
bureau
drawer
and
taking
out
a
file
of
papers
she
sums
it
up
somewhere
confidentially
yes
here
it
is
very
longer
in
the
tooth
slang
for
age
you
know
his
perhaps
holding
off
for
terms
impossible
to
say
without
knowing
more
but
inclined
to
think
on
the
know
her
to
act
on
impulse
some
day
both
have
style
what
does
that
mean
said
soames
between
close
lips
well
murmured
polteed
with
a
smile
showing
many
white
teeth
an
expression
we
use
in
other
words
it
not
likely
to
be
a
weekend
come
together
seriously
or
not
at
h
muttered
soames
that
all
is
it
yes
said
polteed
but
quite
thought
soames
he
walked
into
the
green
park
that
he
might
cross
to
victoria
station
and
take
the
underground
into
the
city
for
so
late
in
january
it
was
warm
sunlight
through
the
haze
sparkled
on
the
frosty
illumined
cobweb
of
a
day
little
great
spiders
and
the
greatest
spinner
of
all
his
own
tenacity
for
ever
wrapping
its
cocoon
of
threads
round
any
clear
way
out
what
was
that
fellow
hanging
round
irene
for
was
it
really
as
polteed
suggested
or
was
jolyon
but
taking
compassion
on
her
loneliness
as
he
would
call
radical
chap
that
he
had
always
been
if
it
were
indeed
as
polteed
hinted
soames
stood
still
it
could
not
be
the
fellow
was
seven
years
older
than
himself
no
better
looking
no
richer
what
attraction
had
he
he
come
back
he
thought
does
go
and
see
him
and
taking
out
a
card
he
wrote
if
you
can
spare
half
an
hour
some
afternoon
this
week
i
shall
be
at
the
connoisseurs
any
day
between
and
or
i
could
come
to
the
hotch
potch
if
you
prefer
it
i
want
to
see
he
walked
up
james
street
and
confided
it
to
the
porter
at
the
hotch
potch
give
jolyon
forsyte
this
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
he
said
and
took
one
of
the
new
motor
cabs
into
the
city
jolyon
received
that
card
the
same
afternoon
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
connoisseurs
what
did
soames
want
now
had
he
got
wind
of
paris
and
stepping
across
james
street
he
determined
to
make
no
secret
of
his
visit
it
wo
do
he
thought
let
him
know
she
there
unless
he
knows
already
in
this
complicated
state
of
mind
he
was
conducted
to
where
soames
was
drinking
tea
in
a
small
no
tea
thanks
said
jolyon
but
i
go
on
smoking
if
i
the
curtains
were
not
yet
drawn
though
the
lamps
outside
were
lighted
the
two
cousins
sat
waiting
on
each
other
you
been
in
paris
i
hear
said
soames
at
last
yes
just
young
val
told
me
he
and
your
boy
are
going
off
then
jolyon
nodded
you
did
happen
to
see
irene
i
suppose
it
appears
she
abroad
jolyon
wreathed
himself
in
smoke
before
he
answered
yes
i
saw
how
was
she
very
there
was
another
silence
then
soames
roused
himself
in
his
chair
when
i
saw
you
last
he
said
i
was
in
two
minds
we
talked
and
you
expressed
your
opinion
i
do
wish
to
reopen
that
discussion
i
only
wanted
to
say
this
my
position
with
her
is
extremely
difficult
i
want
you
to
go
using
your
influence
against
me
what
happened
is
a
very
long
time
ago
i
going
to
ask
her
to
let
bygones
be
you
have
asked
her
you
know
murmured
jolyon
the
idea
was
new
to
her
then
it
came
as
a
shock
but
the
more
she
thinks
of
it
the
more
she
must
see
that
it
the
only
way
out
for
both
of
that
not
my
impression
of
her
state
of
mind
said
jolyon
with
particular
calm
and
forgive
my
saying
you
misconceive
the
matter
if
you
think
reason
comes
into
it
at
he
saw
his
cousin
pale
face
grow
had
used
without
knowing
it
irene
own
words
thanks
muttered
soames
but
i
see
things
perhaps
more
plainly
than
you
think
i
only
want
to
be
sure
that
you
wo
try
to
influence
her
against
i
do
know
what
makes
you
think
i
have
any
influence
said
jolyon
but
if
i
have
i
bound
to
use
it
in
the
direction
of
what
i
think
is
her
happiness
i
am
what
they
call
a
i
feminist
repeated
soames
as
if
seeking
to
gain
time
does
that
mean
that
you
against
me
bluntly
said
jolyon
i
against
any
woman
living
with
any
man
whom
she
definitely
dislikes
it
appears
to
me
and
i
suppose
each
time
you
see
her
you
put
your
opinions
into
her
i
am
not
likely
to
be
seeing
not
going
back
to
paris
not
so
far
as
i
know
said
jolyon
conscious
of
the
intent
watchfulness
in
soames
face
well
that
all
i
had
to
say
anyone
who
comes
between
man
and
wife
you
know
incurs
heavy
jolyon
rose
and
made
him
a
slight
bow
he
said
and
without
offering
to
shake
hands
moved
away
leaving
soames
staring
after
him
forsytes
thought
jolyon
hailing
a
cab
very
civilised
with
simpler
folk
that
might
have
come
to
a
row
if
it
were
for
my
boy
going
to
the
war
the
war
a
gust
of
his
old
doubt
swept
over
him
a
precious
war
domination
of
peoples
or
of
women
attempts
to
master
and
possess
those
who
did
not
want
you
the
negation
of
gentle
decency
possession
vested
rights
and
anyone
heaven
he
thought
always
felt
agin
anyway
yes
even
before
his
first
disastrous
marriage
he
could
remember
fuming
over
the
bludgeoning
of
ireland
or
the
matrimonial
suits
of
women
trying
to
be
free
of
men
they
loathed
parsons
would
have
it
that
freedom
of
soul
and
body
were
quite
different
things
pernicious
doctrine
body
and
soul
could
not
thus
be
separated
free
will
was
the
strength
of
any
tie
and
not
its
weakness
ought
to
have
told
soames
he
thought
i
think
him
comic
ah
but
he
tragic
too
was
there
anything
indeed
more
tragic
in
the
world
than
a
man
enslaved
by
his
own
possessive
instinct
who
could
see
the
sky
for
it
or
even
enter
fully
into
what
another
person
felt
must
write
and
warn
her
he
thought
going
to
have
another
try
and
all
the
way
home
to
robin
hill
he
rebelled
at
the
strength
of
that
duty
to
his
son
which
prevented
him
from
posting
back
to
paris
but
soames
sat
long
in
his
chair
the
prey
of
a
no
less
gnawing
jealous
ache
as
if
it
had
been
revealed
to
him
that
this
fellow
held
precedence
of
himself
and
had
spun
fresh
threads
of
resistance
to
his
way
out
that
mean
that
you
against
me
he
had
got
nothing
out
of
that
disingenuous
question
feminist
phrasey
fellow
must
rush
things
he
thought
have
some
breathing
space
he
not
going
back
to
paris
unless
he
was
lying
i
let
the
spring
come
though
how
the
spring
could
serve
him
save
by
adding
to
his
ache
he
could
not
tell
and
gazing
down
into
the
street
where
figures
were
passing
from
pool
to
pool
of
the
light
from
the
high
lamps
he
thought
seems
any
seems
worth
while
i
the
trouble
he
closed
his
eyes
and
at
once
he
seemed
to
see
irene
in
a
dark
street
below
a
turning
her
neck
so
that
he
caught
the
gleam
of
her
eyes
and
her
white
forehead
under
a
little
dark
hat
which
had
gold
spangles
on
it
and
a
veil
hanging
down
behind
he
opened
his
vividly
he
had
seen
her
a
woman
was
passing
below
but
not
she
oh
no
there
was
nothing
there
chapter
we
are
again
imogen
frocks
for
her
first
season
exercised
the
judgment
of
her
mother
and
the
purse
of
her
grandfather
all
through
the
month
of
march
with
forsyte
tenacity
winifred
quested
for
perfection
it
took
her
mind
off
the
slowly
approaching
rite
which
would
give
her
a
freedom
but
doubtfully
desired
took
her
mind
too
off
her
boy
and
his
fast
approaching
departure
for
a
war
from
which
the
news
remained
disquieting
like
bees
busy
on
summer
flowers
or
bright
gadflies
hovering
and
darting
over
spiky
autumn
blossoms
she
and
her
daughter
tall
nearly
as
herself
and
with
a
bust
measurement
not
far
inferior
hovered
in
the
shops
of
regent
street
the
establishments
of
hanover
square
and
of
bond
street
lost
in
consideration
and
the
feel
of
fabrics
dozens
of
young
women
of
striking
deportment
and
peculiar
gait
paraded
before
winifred
and
imogen
draped
in
the
new
modom
quite
the
latest
which
those
two
reluctantly
turned
down
would
have
filled
a
museum
the
models
which
they
were
obliged
to
have
nearly
emptied
james
bank
it
was
no
good
doing
things
by
halves
winifred
felt
in
view
of
the
need
for
making
this
first
and
sole
untarnished
season
a
conspicuous
success
their
patience
in
trying
the
patience
of
those
impersonal
creatures
who
swam
about
before
them
could
alone
have
been
displayed
by
such
as
were
moved
by
faith
it
was
for
winifred
a
long
prostration
before
her
dear
goddess
fashion
fervent
as
a
catholic
might
make
before
the
virgin
for
imogen
an
experience
by
no
means
too
often
looked
so
nice
and
flattery
was
implicit
everywhere
in
a
word
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
march
having
as
it
were
gutted
skywards
they
had
sought
refreshment
over
the
way
at
caramel
and
baker
and
stored
with
chocolate
frothed
at
the
top
with
cream
turned
homewards
through
berkeley
square
of
an
evening
touched
with
spring
opening
the
painted
a
light
nothing
neglected
that
year
to
give
imogen
a
good
passed
towards
the
silver
basket
to
see
if
anyone
had
called
and
suddenly
her
nostrils
twitched
what
was
that
scent
imogen
had
taken
up
a
novel
sent
from
the
library
and
stood
absorbed
rather
sharply
because
of
the
queer
feeling
in
her
breast
winifred
said
take
that
up
dear
and
have
a
rest
before
imogen
still
reading
passed
up
the
stairs
winifred
heard
the
door
of
her
room
slammed
to
and
drew
a
long
savouring
breath
was
it
spring
tickling
her
up
nostalgia
for
her
against
all
wisdom
and
outraged
virtue
a
male
scent
a
faint
reek
of
cigars
and
not
smelt
since
that
early
autumn
night
six
months
ago
when
she
had
called
him
limit
whence
came
it
or
was
it
ghost
of
emanation
from
memory
she
looked
round
her
a
thing
no
tiniest
disturbance
of
her
hall
nor
of
the
diningroom
a
little
of
a
saddening
silly
in
the
silver
basket
were
new
cards
two
with
and
polegate
thom
and
one
with
polegate
thom
thereon
she
sniffed
them
but
they
smelled
severe
must
be
tired
she
thought
go
and
lie
down
upstairs
the
was
darkened
waiting
for
some
hand
to
give
it
evening
light
and
she
passed
on
up
to
her
bedroom
this
too
was
and
dim
for
it
was
six
winifred
threw
off
her
scent
again
stood
as
if
shot
transfixed
against
the
something
dark
had
risen
from
the
sofa
in
the
far
corner
a
word
of
her
her
god
it
said
a
voice
clutching
the
winifred
reached
up
and
turned
the
switch
of
the
light
hanging
above
her
he
appeared
just
on
the
rim
of
the
light
circumference
emblazoned
from
the
absence
of
his
down
to
boots
neat
and
sooty
brown
at
the
toecap
his
chest
and
face
were
shadowy
surely
he
was
was
it
a
trick
of
the
light
he
advanced
lighted
now
from
to
the
top
of
his
dark
a
little
grizzled
his
complexion
had
darkened
sallowed
his
black
moustache
had
lost
boldness
become
sardonic
there
were
lines
which
she
did
not
know
about
his
face
there
was
no
pin
in
his
tie
his
knew
how
unpressed
unglossy
she
stared
again
at
the
of
his
boot
something
big
and
relentless
had
been
him
had
turned
and
twisted
raked
and
scraped
him
and
she
stayed
not
speaking
motionless
staring
at
that
crack
across
the
toe
well
he
said
i
got
the
order
i
winifred
bosom
began
to
heave
the
nostalgia
for
her
husband
which
had
rushed
up
with
that
scent
was
struggling
with
a
deeper
jealousy
than
any
she
had
felt
yet
there
he
dark
and
as
if
harried
shadow
of
his
sleek
and
brazen
self
what
force
had
done
this
to
him
like
an
orange
to
its
dry
rind
that
woman
i
back
he
said
again
i
had
a
beastly
time
by
god
i
came
steerage
i
got
nothing
but
what
i
stand
up
in
and
that
and
who
has
the
rest
cried
winifred
suddenly
alive
how
dared
you
come
you
knew
it
was
just
for
divorce
that
you
got
that
order
to
come
back
do
touch
me
they
held
each
to
the
rail
of
the
big
bed
where
they
had
spent
so
many
years
of
nights
together
many
times
times
she
had
wanted
him
back
but
now
that
he
had
come
she
was
filled
with
this
cold
and
deadly
resentment
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
moustache
but
did
not
frizz
and
twist
it
in
the
old
familiar
way
he
just
pulled
it
downwards
gad
he
said
if
you
knew
the
time
i
had
i
glad
i
do
are
the
kids
all
right
winifred
nodded
how
did
you
get
in
with
my
then
the
maids
do
know
you
ca
stay
here
he
uttered
a
little
sardonic
laugh
where
then
well
look
at
me
damned
if
you
mention
her
cried
winifred
i
go
straight
out
to
park
lane
and
i
do
come
suddenly
he
did
a
simple
thing
but
so
uncharacteristic
that
it
moved
her
he
shut
his
eyes
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
right
i
dead
to
the
world
you
can
have
a
room
for
the
night
she
said
your
things
are
still
here
only
imogen
is
at
he
leaned
back
against
the
well
it
in
your
hands
and
his
own
made
a
writhing
movement
i
been
through
it
you
need
hit
too
is
worth
while
i
been
frightened
i
been
frightened
that
old
pet
name
disused
for
years
and
years
sent
a
shiver
through
winifred
am
i
to
do
with
him
she
thought
in
god
name
am
i
to
do
with
him
got
a
cigarette
she
gave
him
one
from
a
little
box
she
kept
up
there
for
when
she
could
sleep
at
night
and
lighted
it
with
that
action
the
side
of
her
nature
came
to
life
again
go
and
have
a
hot
bath
i
put
some
clothes
out
for
you
in
the
we
can
talk
he
nodded
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
looked
or
was
it
that
the
folds
in
the
lids
had
become
heavier
not
the
same
she
thought
he
would
never
be
quite
the
same
again
but
what
would
he
be
all
right
he
said
and
went
towards
the
door
he
even
moved
differently
like
a
man
who
has
lost
illusion
and
doubts
whether
it
is
worth
while
to
move
at
all
when
he
was
gone
and
she
heard
the
water
in
the
bath
running
she
put
out
a
complete
set
of
garments
on
the
bed
in
his
then
went
downstairs
and
fetched
up
the
biscuit
box
and
whisky
putting
on
her
coat
again
and
listening
a
moment
at
the
bathroom
door
she
went
down
and
out
in
the
street
she
hesitated
past
seven
would
soames
be
at
his
club
or
at
park
lane
she
turned
towards
the
latter
back
soames
had
always
feared
had
sometimes
hoped
it
back
so
like
that
he
this
we
are
again
to
make
fools
of
them
the
law
of
soames
of
herself
yet
to
have
done
with
the
law
not
to
have
that
murky
cloud
hanging
over
her
and
the
children
what
a
relief
ah
but
how
to
accept
his
return
that
had
ravaged
him
taken
from
him
passion
such
as
he
had
never
bestowed
on
herself
such
as
she
had
not
thought
him
capable
of
there
was
the
sting
that
selfish
blatant
of
hers
whom
she
herself
had
never
really
stirred
had
been
swept
and
ungarnished
by
another
woman
insulting
too
insulting
not
right
not
decent
to
take
him
back
and
yet
she
had
asked
for
him
the
law
perhaps
would
make
her
now
he
was
as
much
her
husband
as
had
put
herself
out
of
court
and
all
he
wanted
no
doubt
was
keep
him
in
cigars
and
that
scent
all
i
not
old
she
thought
old
yet
but
that
woman
who
had
reduced
him
to
those
words
been
through
it
i
been
freddie
she
neared
her
father
house
driven
this
way
and
that
while
all
the
time
the
forsyte
undertow
was
drawing
her
to
deep
conclusion
that
after
all
he
was
her
property
to
be
held
against
a
robbing
world
and
so
she
came
to
james
mr
soames
in
his
room
i
go
up
do
say
i
her
brother
was
dressing
she
found
him
before
a
mirror
tying
a
black
bow
with
an
air
of
despising
its
ends
hullo
he
said
contemplating
her
in
the
glass
what
wrong
monty
said
winifred
stonily
soames
spun
round
what
back
hoist
muttered
soames
with
our
own
petard
why
the
deuce
did
you
let
me
try
cruelty
i
always
knew
it
was
too
much
risk
this
oh
do
talk
about
that
what
shall
i
do
soames
answered
with
a
deep
deep
sound
well
said
winifred
impatiently
what
has
he
to
say
for
himself
nothing
one
of
his
boots
is
split
across
the
soames
stared
at
her
ah
he
said
of
course
on
his
beam
ends
begins
again
about
finish
ca
we
keep
it
from
him
impossible
he
has
an
uncanny
flair
for
anything
that
and
he
brooded
with
fingers
hooked
into
his
blue
silk
braces
there
ought
to
be
some
way
in
law
he
muttered
to
make
him
no
cried
winifred
i
wo
be
made
a
fool
of
again
i
sooner
put
up
with
the
two
stared
at
each
other
their
hearts
were
full
of
feeling
but
they
could
give
it
no
that
they
were
where
did
you
leave
him
in
the
bath
and
winifred
gave
a
little
bitter
laugh
the
only
thing
he
brought
back
is
steady
said
soames
you
thoroughly
upset
i
go
back
with
what
the
use
we
ought
to
make
terms
with
terms
it
always
be
the
same
when
he
and
betting
drink
and
she
was
silent
remembering
the
look
on
her
face
the
burnt
burnt
child
perhaps
recovers
replied
soames
is
he
ill
no
burnt
out
that
soames
took
his
waistcoat
from
a
chair
and
put
it
on
he
took
his
coat
and
got
into
it
he
scented
his
handkerchief
with
threaded
his
and
said
we
have
any
and
in
the
midst
of
her
own
trouble
winifred
was
sorry
for
him
as
if
in
that
little
saying
he
had
revealed
deep
trouble
of
his
own
i
like
to
see
mother
she
said
she
be
with
father
in
their
room
come
down
quietly
to
the
study
i
get
winifred
stole
down
to
the
little
dark
study
chiefly
remarkable
for
a
canaletto
too
doubtful
to
be
placed
elsewhere
and
a
fine
collection
of
law
reports
unopened
for
many
years
here
she
stood
with
her
back
to
curtains
staring
at
the
empty
grate
till
her
mother
came
in
followed
by
soames
oh
my
poor
dear
said
emily
how
miserable
you
look
in
here
this
is
too
bad
of
him
really
as
a
family
they
had
so
guarded
themselves
from
the
expression
of
all
unfashionable
emotion
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
up
and
give
her
daughter
a
good
hug
but
there
was
comfort
in
her
cushioned
voice
and
her
still
dimpled
shoulders
under
some
rare
black
lace
summoning
pride
and
the
desire
not
to
distress
her
mother
winifred
said
in
her
most
voice
it
all
right
mother
no
good
i
do
see
said
emily
looking
at
soames
why
winifred
tell
him
that
she
prosecute
him
if
he
does
keep
off
the
premises
he
took
her
pearls
and
if
he
not
brought
them
back
that
quite
winifred
smiled
they
would
all
plunge
about
with
suggestions
of
this
and
that
but
she
knew
already
what
she
would
be
doing
and
that
the
feeling
that
after
all
she
had
won
a
sort
of
victory
retained
her
property
was
every
moment
gaining
ground
in
her
no
if
she
wanted
to
punish
him
she
could
do
it
at
home
without
the
world
knowing
well
said
emily
come
into
the
must
stay
and
have
dinner
with
us
leave
it
to
me
to
tell
your
and
as
winifred
moved
towards
the
door
she
turned
out
the
light
not
till
then
did
they
see
the
disaster
in
the
corridor
there
attracted
by
light
from
a
room
never
lighted
james
was
standing
with
his
duncoloured
shawl
folded
about
him
so
that
his
arms
were
not
free
and
his
silvered
head
looked
cut
off
from
his
fashionably
trousered
legs
as
if
by
an
expanse
of
desert
he
stood
inimitably
with
an
expression
as
if
he
saw
before
him
a
frog
too
large
to
swallow
what
all
this
he
said
tell
your
father
you
never
tell
me
the
moment
found
emily
without
reply
it
was
winifred
who
went
up
to
him
and
laying
one
hand
on
each
of
his
swathed
helpless
arms
said
monty
not
gone
bankrupt
father
he
only
come
they
all
three
expected
something
serious
to
happen
and
were
glad
she
had
kept
that
grip
of
his
arms
but
they
did
not
know
the
depth
of
root
in
that
shadowy
old
forsyte
something
wry
occurred
about
his
shaven
mouth
and
chin
something
scratchy
between
those
long
silvery
whiskers
then
he
said
with
a
sort
of
dignity
he
be
the
death
of
me
i
knew
how
it
would
you
must
worry
father
said
winifred
calmly
i
mean
to
make
him
ah
said
james
here
take
this
thing
off
i
they
unwound
the
shawl
he
turned
and
walked
firmly
to
the
i
do
want
any
soup
he
said
to
warmson
and
sat
down
in
his
chair
they
all
sat
down
too
winifred
still
in
her
hat
while
warmson
laid
the
fourth
place
when
he
left
the
room
james
said
what
he
brought
back
nothing
james
concentrated
his
eyes
on
his
own
image
in
a
tablespoon
divorce
he
muttered
rubbish
what
was
i
about
i
ought
to
have
paid
him
an
allowance
to
stay
out
of
england
soames
you
go
and
propose
it
to
it
seemed
so
right
and
simple
a
suggestion
that
even
winifred
was
surprised
when
she
said
no
i
keep
him
now
he
back
he
must
just
they
all
looked
at
her
it
had
always
been
known
that
winifred
had
pluck
out
there
said
james
elliptically
who
knows
what
you
look
for
his
revolver
do
go
to
bed
without
you
ought
to
have
warmson
to
sleep
in
the
house
i
see
him
myself
they
were
touched
by
this
declaration
and
emily
said
comfortably
that
right
james
we
wo
have
any
ah
muttered
james
darkly
i
ca
the
advent
of
warmson
with
fish
diverted
conversation
when
directly
after
dinner
winifred
went
over
to
kiss
her
father
he
looked
up
with
eyes
so
full
of
question
and
distress
that
she
put
all
the
comfort
she
could
into
her
voice
it
all
right
daddy
dear
do
worry
i
sha
need
quite
bland
i
shall
only
be
upset
if
you
worry
bless
you
james
repeated
the
words
bless
you
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
they
meant
and
his
eyes
followed
her
to
the
door
she
reached
home
before
nine
and
went
straight
upstairs
dartie
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
his
fully
redressed
in
a
blue
serge
suit
and
pumps
his
arms
were
crossed
behind
his
head
and
an
extinct
cigarette
drooped
from
his
mouth
winifred
remembered
ridiculously
the
flowers
in
her
after
a
blazing
summer
day
the
way
they
lay
or
rather
yet
rested
by
the
sun
retreat
it
was
as
if
a
little
dew
had
come
already
on
her
husband
he
said
apathetically
i
suppose
you
been
to
park
lane
how
the
old
man
winifred
could
not
help
the
bitter
answer
not
he
winced
actually
he
winced
understand
monty
she
said
i
will
not
have
him
worried
if
you
are
going
to
behave
yourself
you
may
go
back
you
may
go
anywhere
have
you
had
dinner
no
would
you
like
some
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
imogen
offered
me
some
i
did
want
imogen
in
the
plenitude
of
emotion
winifred
had
forgotten
her
so
you
seen
her
what
did
she
say
she
gave
me
a
with
mortification
winifred
saw
his
dark
sardonic
face
relaxed
she
thought
cares
for
her
not
for
me
a
bit
dartie
eyes
were
moving
from
side
to
side
does
she
know
about
me
he
said
it
flashed
through
winifred
that
here
was
the
weapon
she
needed
he
minded
their
knowing
no
val
knows
the
others
do
they
only
know
you
went
she
heard
him
sigh
with
relief
but
they
shall
know
she
said
firmly
if
you
give
me
all
right
he
muttered
hit
me
i
down
winifred
went
up
to
the
bed
look
here
monty
i
do
want
to
hit
you
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
i
sha
allude
to
anything
i
not
going
to
worry
what
the
use
she
was
silent
a
moment
i
ca
stand
any
more
though
and
i
wo
you
better
know
you
made
me
suffer
but
i
used
to
be
fond
of
you
for
the
sake
of
that
she
met
the
gaze
of
his
brown
eyes
with
the
downward
stare
of
her
eyes
touched
his
hand
suddenly
turned
her
back
and
went
into
her
room
she
sat
there
a
long
time
before
her
glass
fingering
her
rings
thinking
of
this
subdued
dark
man
almost
a
stranger
to
her
on
the
bed
in
the
other
room
resolutely
not
but
gnawed
by
jealousy
of
what
he
had
been
through
and
now
and
again
just
visited
by
pity
chapter
night
soames
doggedly
let
the
spring
easy
task
for
one
conscious
that
time
was
flying
his
birds
in
the
bush
no
nearer
the
hand
no
issue
from
the
web
anywhere
visible
polteed
reported
nothing
except
that
his
watch
went
a
lot
of
money
val
and
his
cousin
were
gone
to
the
war
whence
came
news
more
favourable
dartie
was
behaving
himself
so
far
james
had
retained
his
health
business
prospered
almost
was
nothing
to
worry
soames
except
that
he
was
up
could
make
no
step
in
any
direction
he
did
not
exactly
avoid
soho
for
he
could
not
afford
to
let
them
think
that
he
had
off
as
james
would
have
put
might
want
to
on
again
at
any
minute
but
he
had
to
be
so
restrained
and
cautious
that
he
would
often
pass
the
door
of
the
restaurant
bretagne
without
going
in
and
wander
out
of
the
purlieus
of
that
region
which
always
gave
him
the
feeling
of
having
been
possessively
irregular
he
wandered
thus
one
may
night
into
regent
street
and
the
most
amazing
crowd
he
had
ever
seen
a
shrieking
whistling
dancing
jostling
grotesque
and
formidably
jovial
crowd
with
false
noses
and
penny
whistles
and
long
feathers
every
appanage
of
idiocy
as
it
seemed
to
him
mafeking
of
course
it
had
been
relieved
good
but
was
that
an
excuse
who
were
these
people
what
were
they
where
had
they
come
from
into
the
west
end
his
face
was
tickled
his
ears
whistled
into
girls
cried
your
hair
on
stucco
a
youth
so
knocked
off
his
that
he
recovered
it
with
difficulty
crackers
were
exploding
beneath
his
nose
between
his
feet
he
was
bewildered
exasperated
offended
this
stream
of
people
came
from
every
quarter
as
if
impulse
had
unlocked
let
flow
waters
of
whose
existence
he
had
heard
perhaps
but
believed
in
never
this
then
was
the
populace
the
innumerable
living
negation
of
gentility
and
forsyteism
this
it
stank
yelled
was
hideous
in
the
east
end
or
even
soho
here
in
regent
street
in
piccadilly
what
were
the
police
about
in
soames
with
his
forsyte
thousands
had
never
seen
the
cauldron
with
the
lid
off
and
now
looking
into
it
could
hardly
believe
his
scorching
eyes
the
whole
thing
was
unspeakable
these
people
had
no
restraint
they
seemed
to
think
him
funny
such
swarms
of
them
rude
coarse
what
laughter
nothing
sacred
to
them
he
should
be
surprised
if
they
began
to
break
windows
in
pall
mall
past
those
august
dwellings
to
enter
which
people
paid
sixty
pounds
this
shrieking
whistling
dancing
dervish
of
a
crowd
was
swarming
from
the
club
windows
his
own
kind
were
looking
out
on
them
with
regulated
amusement
they
did
realise
why
this
was
come
to
anything
the
crowd
was
cheerful
but
some
day
they
would
come
in
different
mood
he
remembered
there
had
been
a
mob
in
the
late
eighties
when
he
was
at
brighton
they
had
smashed
things
and
made
speeches
but
more
than
dread
he
felt
a
deep
surprise
they
were
was
english
and
all
about
the
relief
of
a
little
town
as
big
six
thousand
miles
away
restraint
reserve
those
qualities
to
him
more
dear
almost
than
life
those
indispensable
attributes
of
property
and
culture
where
were
they
it
was
english
no
it
was
english
so
soames
brooded
threading
his
way
on
it
was
as
if
he
had
suddenly
caught
sight
of
someone
cutting
the
covenant
quiet
possession
out
of
his
legal
documents
or
of
a
monster
lurking
and
stalking
out
in
the
future
casting
its
shadow
before
their
want
of
stolidity
their
want
of
reverence
it
was
like
discovering
that
of
the
people
of
england
were
foreigners
and
if
that
were
anything
might
happen
at
hyde
park
corner
he
ran
into
george
forsyte
very
sunburnt
from
racing
holding
a
false
nose
in
his
hand
hallo
soames
he
said
have
a
nose
soames
responded
with
a
pale
smile
got
this
from
one
of
these
sportsmen
went
on
george
who
had
evidently
been
dining
had
to
lay
him
trying
to
bash
my
hat
i
say
one
of
these
days
we
shall
have
to
fight
these
chaps
getting
so
damned
radicals
and
socialists
they
want
our
goods
you
tell
uncle
james
that
it
make
him
vino
veritas
thought
soames
but
he
only
nodded
and
passed
on
up
hamilton
place
there
was
but
a
trickle
of
roysterers
in
park
lane
not
very
noisy
and
looking
up
at
the
houses
he
thought
all
the
backbone
of
the
country
they
wo
upset
us
easily
nine
points
of
the
law
but
as
he
closed
the
door
of
his
father
house
behind
him
all
that
queer
outlandish
nightmare
in
the
streets
passed
out
of
his
mind
almost
as
completely
as
if
having
dreamed
it
he
had
awakened
in
the
warm
clean
morning
comfort
of
his
bed
walking
into
the
centre
of
the
great
empty
he
stood
still
a
wife
somebody
to
talk
things
over
with
one
had
a
right
damn
it
one
had
a
right
part
iii
chapter
in
paris
soames
had
travelled
little
aged
nineteen
he
had
made
the
with
his
father
mother
and
the
rhine
switzerland
and
home
by
way
of
paris
aged
just
when
he
began
to
take
interest
in
pictures
he
had
spent
five
hot
weeks
in
italy
looking
into
the
so
much
in
it
as
he
had
been
led
to
a
fortnight
in
paris
on
his
way
back
looking
into
himself
as
became
a
forsyte
surrounded
by
people
so
strongly
and
as
the
french
his
knowledge
of
their
language
being
derived
from
his
public
school
he
did
not
understand
them
when
they
spoke
silence
he
had
found
better
for
all
parties
one
did
not
make
a
fool
of
oneself
he
had
disliked
the
look
of
the
men
clothes
the
cabs
the
theatres
which
looked
like
the
galleries
which
smelled
of
beeswax
he
was
too
cautious
and
too
shy
to
explore
that
side
of
paris
supposed
by
forsytes
to
constitute
its
attraction
under
the
rose
and
as
for
a
collector
one
to
be
had
as
nicholas
might
have
put
were
a
grasping
lot
he
had
come
back
uneasy
saying
paris
was
overrated
when
therefore
in
june
of
he
went
to
paris
it
was
but
his
third
attempt
on
the
centre
of
civilisation
this
time
however
the
mountain
was
going
to
mahomet
for
he
felt
by
now
more
deeply
civilised
than
paris
and
perhaps
he
really
was
moreover
he
had
a
definite
objective
this
was
no
mere
genuflexion
to
a
shrine
of
taste
and
immorality
but
the
prosecution
of
his
own
legitimate
affairs
he
went
indeed
because
things
were
getting
past
a
joke
the
watch
went
on
and
on
jolyon
had
never
returned
to
paris
and
no
one
else
was
busy
with
new
and
very
confidential
matters
soames
was
realising
more
than
ever
how
essential
reputation
is
to
a
solicitor
but
at
night
and
in
his
leisure
moments
he
was
ravaged
by
the
thought
that
time
was
always
flying
and
money
flowing
in
and
his
own
future
as
much
irons
as
ever
since
mafeking
night
he
had
become
aware
that
a
fool
of
a
doctor
was
hanging
round
annette
twice
he
had
come
across
cheerful
young
fool
not
more
than
thirty
nothing
annoyed
soames
so
much
as
indecent
extravagant
sort
of
quality
which
had
no
relation
to
facts
the
mixture
of
his
desires
and
hopes
was
in
a
word
becoming
torture
and
lately
the
thought
had
come
to
him
that
perhaps
irene
knew
she
was
being
shadowed
it
was
this
which
finally
decided
him
to
go
and
see
for
himself
to
go
and
once
more
try
to
break
down
her
repugnance
her
refusal
to
make
her
own
and
his
path
comparatively
smooth
once
more
if
he
failed
he
would
see
what
she
did
with
herself
anyway
he
went
to
an
hotel
in
the
rue
caumartin
highly
recommended
to
forsytes
where
practically
nobody
spoke
french
he
had
formed
no
plan
he
did
not
want
to
startle
her
yet
must
contrive
that
she
had
no
chance
to
evade
him
by
flight
and
next
morning
he
set
out
in
bright
weather
paris
had
an
air
of
gaiety
a
sparkle
over
its
which
almost
annoyed
soames
he
stepped
gravely
his
nose
lifted
a
little
sideways
in
real
curiosity
he
desired
now
to
understand
things
french
was
not
annette
french
there
was
much
to
be
got
out
of
his
visit
if
he
could
only
get
it
in
this
laudable
mood
and
the
place
de
la
concorde
he
was
nearly
run
down
three
times
he
came
on
the
la
reine
where
irene
hotel
was
situated
almost
too
suddenly
for
he
had
not
yet
fixed
on
his
procedure
crossing
over
to
the
river
side
he
noted
the
building
white
and
with
green
sunblinds
seen
through
a
screen
of
leaves
and
conscious
that
it
would
be
far
better
to
meet
her
casually
in
some
open
place
than
to
risk
a
call
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
whence
he
could
watch
the
entrance
it
was
not
quite
eleven
and
improbable
that
she
had
yet
gone
out
some
pigeons
were
strutting
and
preening
their
feathers
in
the
pools
of
sunlight
between
the
shadows
of
the
a
workman
in
a
blue
blouse
passed
and
threw
them
crumbs
from
the
paper
which
contained
his
dinner
a
coiffed
with
ribbon
shepherded
two
little
girls
with
and
frilled
drawers
a
cab
meandered
by
whose
cocher
wore
a
blue
coat
and
a
hat
to
soames
a
kind
of
affectation
seemed
to
cling
about
it
all
a
sort
of
picturesqueness
which
was
out
of
date
a
theatrical
people
the
french
he
lit
one
of
his
rare
cigarettes
with
a
sense
of
injury
that
fate
should
be
casting
his
life
into
outlandish
waters
he
should
wonder
if
irene
quite
enjoyed
this
foreign
life
she
had
never
been
properly
to
look
at
and
he
began
considering
which
of
those
windows
could
be
hers
under
the
green
sunblinds
how
could
he
word
what
he
had
come
to
say
so
that
it
might
pierce
the
defence
of
her
proud
obstinacy
he
threw
the
of
his
cigarette
at
a
pigeon
with
the
thought
ca
stay
here
for
ever
twiddling
my
thumbs
better
give
it
up
and
call
on
her
in
the
late
afternoon
but
he
still
sat
on
heard
twelve
strike
and
then
wait
till
one
he
thought
i
about
it
but
just
then
he
started
up
and
shrinkingly
sat
down
again
a
woman
had
come
out
in
a
frock
and
was
moving
away
under
a
parasol
irene
herself
he
waited
till
she
was
too
far
away
to
recognise
him
then
set
out
after
her
she
was
strolling
as
though
she
had
no
particular
objective
moving
if
he
remembered
rightly
toward
the
bois
de
boulogne
for
half
an
hour
at
least
he
kept
his
distance
on
the
far
side
of
the
way
till
she
had
passed
into
the
bois
itself
was
she
going
to
meet
someone
after
all
some
confounded
of
those
ami
chaps
perhaps
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
hang
about
he
had
read
that
book
with
difficulty
and
a
sort
of
disgusted
fascination
he
followed
doggedly
along
a
shady
alley
losing
sight
of
her
now
and
then
when
the
path
curved
and
it
came
back
to
him
how
long
ago
one
night
in
hyde
park
he
had
slid
and
sneaked
from
tree
to
tree
from
seat
to
seat
hunting
blindly
ridiculously
in
burning
jealousy
for
her
and
young
bosinney
the
path
bent
sharply
and
hurrying
he
came
on
her
sitting
in
front
of
a
small
little
niobe
veiled
in
hair
to
her
slender
hips
gazing
at
the
pool
she
had
wept
he
came
on
her
so
suddenly
that
he
was
past
before
he
could
turn
and
take
off
his
hat
she
did
not
start
up
she
had
always
had
great
was
one
of
the
things
he
most
admired
in
her
one
of
his
greatest
grievances
against
her
because
he
had
never
been
able
to
tell
what
she
was
thinking
had
she
realised
that
he
was
following
her
made
him
angry
and
disdaining
to
explain
his
presence
he
pointed
to
the
mournful
little
niobe
and
said
that
rather
a
good
he
could
see
then
that
she
was
struggling
to
preserve
her
composure
i
did
want
to
startle
you
is
this
one
of
your
haunts
a
little
as
he
spoke
a
lady
strolling
by
paused
to
look
at
the
fountain
and
passed
on
irene
eyes
followed
her
no
she
said
prodding
the
ground
with
her
parasol
never
lonely
one
has
always
one
soames
understood
and
looking
at
her
hard
he
exclaimed
well
it
your
own
fault
you
can
be
free
of
it
at
any
moment
irene
come
back
to
me
and
be
irene
laughed
do
cried
soames
stamping
his
foot
it
inhuman
listen
is
there
any
condition
i
can
make
which
will
bring
you
back
to
me
if
i
promise
you
a
separate
just
a
visit
now
and
then
irene
rose
something
wild
suddenly
in
her
face
and
figure
none
none
none
you
may
hunt
me
to
the
grave
i
will
not
outraged
and
on
edge
soames
recoiled
do
make
a
scene
he
said
sharply
and
they
both
stood
motionless
staring
at
the
little
niobe
whose
greenish
flesh
the
sunlight
was
burnishing
that
your
last
word
then
muttered
soames
clenching
his
hands
you
condemn
us
irene
bent
her
head
i
ca
come
back
a
feeling
of
monstrous
injustice
flared
up
in
soames
stop
he
said
and
listen
to
me
a
moment
you
gave
me
a
sacred
came
to
me
without
a
penny
you
had
all
i
could
give
you
you
broke
that
vow
without
cause
you
made
me
a
you
refused
me
a
child
you
left
me
in
prison
still
move
me
so
that
i
want
want
you
well
what
do
you
think
of
yourself
irene
turned
her
face
was
deadly
pale
her
eyes
burning
dark
god
made
me
as
i
am
she
said
wicked
if
you
not
so
wicked
that
i
give
myself
again
to
a
man
i
the
sunlight
gleamed
on
her
hair
as
she
moved
away
and
seemed
to
lay
a
caress
all
down
her
clinging
frock
soames
could
neither
speak
nor
move
that
word
extreme
so
all
the
forsyte
in
him
tremble
with
a
deep
imprecation
he
strode
away
from
where
she
had
vanished
and
ran
almost
into
the
arms
of
the
lady
sauntering
fool
the
shadowing
fool
he
was
soon
dripping
with
perspiration
in
the
depths
of
the
bois
he
thought
need
have
no
consideration
for
her
now
she
has
not
a
grain
of
it
for
me
i
show
her
this
very
day
that
she
my
wife
still
but
on
the
way
home
to
his
hotel
he
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
meant
one
could
not
make
scenes
in
public
and
short
of
scenes
in
public
what
was
there
he
could
do
he
almost
cursed
his
own
she
might
deserve
no
consideration
but
deserved
some
at
his
own
hands
and
sitting
lunchless
in
the
hall
of
his
hotel
with
tourists
passing
every
moment
baedeker
in
hand
he
was
visited
by
black
dejection
in
irons
his
whole
life
with
every
natural
instinct
and
every
decent
yearning
gagged
and
fettered
and
all
because
fate
had
driven
him
seventeen
years
ago
to
set
his
heart
upon
this
utterly
that
even
now
he
had
no
real
heart
to
set
on
any
other
cursed
was
the
day
he
had
met
her
and
his
eyes
for
seeing
in
her
anything
but
the
cruel
venus
she
was
and
yet
still
seeing
her
with
the
sunlight
on
the
clinging
china
crepe
of
her
gown
he
uttered
a
little
groan
so
that
a
tourist
who
was
passing
thought
in
pain
see
what
did
i
have
for
lunch
later
in
front
of
a
cafe
near
the
opera
over
a
glass
of
cold
tea
with
lemon
and
a
straw
in
it
he
took
the
malicious
resolution
to
go
and
dine
at
her
hotel
if
she
were
there
he
would
speak
to
her
if
she
were
not
he
would
leave
a
note
he
dressed
carefully
and
wrote
as
follows
your
idyll
with
that
fellow
jolyon
forsyte
is
known
to
me
at
all
events
if
you
pursue
it
understand
that
i
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
make
things
unbearable
for
him
he
sealed
this
note
but
did
not
address
it
refusing
to
write
the
maiden
name
which
she
had
impudently
resumed
or
to
put
the
word
forsyte
on
the
envelope
lest
she
should
tear
it
up
unread
then
he
went
out
and
made
his
way
through
the
glowing
streets
abandoned
to
evening
entering
her
hotel
he
took
his
seat
in
a
far
corner
of
the
whence
he
could
see
all
entrances
and
exits
she
was
not
there
he
ate
little
quickly
watchfully
she
did
not
come
he
lingered
in
the
lounge
over
his
coffee
drank
two
liqueurs
of
brandy
but
still
she
did
not
come
he
went
over
to
the
keyboard
and
examined
the
names
number
twelve
on
the
first
floor
and
he
determined
to
take
the
note
up
himself
he
mounted
stairs
past
a
little
salon
should
he
knock
push
the
note
under
or
he
looked
furtively
round
and
turned
the
handle
the
door
opened
but
into
a
little
space
leading
to
another
door
he
knocked
on
answer
the
door
was
locked
it
fitted
very
closely
to
the
floor
the
note
would
not
go
under
he
thrust
it
back
into
his
pocket
and
stood
a
moment
listening
he
felt
somehow
certain
that
she
was
not
there
and
suddenly
he
came
away
passing
the
little
salon
down
the
stairs
he
stopped
at
the
bureau
and
said
will
you
kindly
see
that
heron
has
this
note
madame
heron
left
about
three
there
was
illness
in
her
soames
compressed
his
lips
oh
he
said
do
you
know
her
address
non
monsieur
england
i
soames
put
the
note
back
into
his
pocket
and
went
out
he
hailed
an
open
which
was
passing
drive
me
anywhere
the
man
who
obviously
did
not
understand
smiled
and
waved
his
whip
and
soames
was
borne
along
in
that
little
victoria
all
over
paris
with
here
and
there
a
pause
and
the
question
par
ici
monsieur
no
go
on
till
the
man
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
the
chariot
continued
to
roll
between
the
tall
shuttered
houses
and
little
flying
dutchman
of
a
cab
my
life
thought
soames
object
on
and
on
chapter
the
web
soames
returned
to
england
the
following
day
and
on
the
third
morning
received
a
visit
from
polteed
who
wore
a
flower
and
carried
a
brown
billycock
hat
soames
motioned
him
to
a
seat
the
news
from
the
war
is
not
so
bad
is
it
said
polteed
i
hope
i
see
you
well
thanks
polteed
leaned
forward
smiled
opened
his
hand
looked
into
it
and
said
softly
i
think
we
done
your
business
for
you
at
what
ejaculated
soames
nineteen
reports
quite
suddenly
what
i
think
we
shall
be
justified
in
calling
conclusive
evidence
and
polteed
paused
well
on
the
instant
after
witnessing
an
interview
between
and
a
party
earlier
in
the
day
can
swear
to
having
seen
him
coming
out
of
her
bedroom
in
the
hotel
about
ten
in
the
evening
with
a
little
care
in
the
giving
of
the
evidence
that
will
be
enough
especially
as
has
left
doubt
with
the
party
in
question
in
fact
they
both
slipped
off
and
we
have
got
on
to
them
again
yet
but
we
shall
she
worked
hard
under
very
difficult
circumstances
and
glad
she
brought
it
off
at
polteed
took
out
a
cigarette
tapped
its
end
against
the
table
looked
at
soames
and
put
it
back
the
expression
on
his
client
face
was
not
encouraging
who
is
this
new
person
said
soames
abruptly
that
we
do
know
she
swear
to
the
fact
and
she
got
his
appearance
polteed
took
out
a
letter
and
began
reading

pale

flat
cheeks
good

soames
rose
and
went
to
the
window
he
stood
there
in
sardonic
fury
congenital
congenital

seven
months
at
fifteen
pounds
a

guilty

he
threw
the
window
open
it
hot
he
said
and
came
back
to
his
seat
crossing
his
knees
he
bent
a
supercilious
glance
on
polteed
i
doubt
if
that
quite
good
enough
he
said
drawling
the
words
with
no
name
or
address
i
think
you
may
let
that
lady
have
a
rest
and
take
up
our
friend
at
this
whether
polteed
had
spotted
him
he
could
not
tell
but
he
had
a
mental
vision
of
him
in
the
midst
of
his
cronies
dissolved
in
inextinguishable
laughter
look
damnation
polteed
said
in
a
tone
of
urgency
almost
of
pathos
i
assure
you
we
have
put
it
through
sometimes
on
less
than
that
it
paris
you
know
attractive
woman
living
alone
why
not
risk
it
sir
we
might
screw
it
up
a
soames
had
sudden
insight
the
fellow
professional
zeal
was
stirred
triumph
of
my
career
got
a
man
his
divorce
through
a
visit
to
his
own
wife
bedroom
something
to
talk
of
there
when
i
retire
and
for
one
wild
moment
he
thought
not
after
all
hundreds
of
men
of
medium
height
had
small
feet
and
a
guilty
look
i
not
authorised
to
take
any
risk
he
said
shortly
polteed
looked
up
pity
he
said
quite
a
pity
that
other
affair
seemed
very
soames
rose
never
mind
that
please
watch
and
take
care
not
to
find
a
nest
polteed
eye
glinted
at
the
words
nest
very
good
you
shall
be
kept
and
soames
was
alone
again
the
spidery
dirty
ridiculous
business
laying
his
arms
on
the
table
he
leaned
his
forehead
on
them
full
ten
minutes
he
rested
thus
till
a
managing
clerk
roused
him
with
the
draft
prospectus
of
a
new
issue
of
shares
very
desirable
in
manifold
and
topping
that
afternoon
he
left
work
early
and
made
his
way
to
the
restaurant
bretagne
only
madame
lamotte
was
in
would
monsieur
have
tea
with
her
soames
bowed
when
they
were
seated
at
right
angles
to
each
other
in
the
little
room
he
said
abruptly
i
want
a
talk
with
you
the
quick
lift
of
her
clear
brown
eyes
told
him
that
she
had
long
expected
such
words
i
have
to
ask
you
something
first
that
young
his
name
is
there
anything
between
him
and
annette
her
whole
personality
had
become
as
it
were
like
black
hard
shining
annette
is
young
she
said
so
is
monsieur
le
docteur
between
young
people
things
move
quickly
but
annette
is
a
good
daughter
ah
what
a
jewel
of
a
nature
the
least
little
smile
twisted
soames
lips
nothing
definite
then
but
indeed
the
young
man
is
veree
nice
would
you
there
is
no
money
at
she
raised
her
soames
did
the
same
their
eyes
met
i
am
a
married
man
he
said
living
apart
from
my
wife
for
many
years
i
am
seeking
to
divorce
madame
lamotte
put
down
her
cup
indeed
what
tragic
things
there
were
the
entire
absence
of
sentiment
in
her
inspired
a
queer
species
of
contempt
in
soames
i
am
a
rich
man
he
added
fully
conscious
that
the
remark
was
not
in
good
taste
it
is
useless
to
say
more
at
present
but
i
think
you
madame
eyes
so
open
that
the
whites
showed
above
them
looked
at
him
very
straight
ah
nous
avons
le
temps
was
all
she
said
another
little
cup
soames
refused
and
taking
his
leave
walked
westward
he
had
got
that
off
his
mind
she
would
not
let
annette
commit
herself
with
that
cheerful
young
ass
until
but
what
chance
of
his
ever
being
able
to
say
free
what
chance
the
future
had
lost
all
semblance
of
reality
he
felt
like
a
fly
entangled
in
cobweb
filaments
watching
the
desirable
freedom
of
the
air
with
pitiful
eyes
he
was
short
of
exercise
and
wandered
on
to
kensington
gardens
and
down
queen
gate
towards
chelsea
perhaps
she
had
gone
back
to
her
flat
that
at
all
events
he
could
find
out
for
since
that
last
and
most
ignominious
repulse
his
wounded
had
taken
refuge
again
in
the
feeling
that
she
must
have
a
lover
he
arrived
before
the
little
mansions
at
the
no
need
to
enquire
a
lady
was
watering
the
in
her
window
it
was
evidently
let
and
he
walked
slowly
past
again
along
the
evening
of
clear
quiet
beauty
all
harmony
and
comfort
except
within
his
heart
chapter
park
on
the
afternoon
that
soames
crossed
to
france
a
cablegram
was
received
by
jolyon
at
robin
hill
your
son
down
with
enteric
no
immediate
danger
will
cable
it
reached
a
household
already
agitated
by
the
imminent
departure
of
june
whose
berth
was
booked
for
the
following
day
she
was
indeed
in
the
act
of
confiding
eric
cobbley
and
his
family
to
her
father
care
when
the
message
arrived
the
resolution
to
become
a
red
cross
nurse
taken
under
stimulus
of
jolly
enlistment
had
been
loyally
fulfilled
with
the
irritation
and
regret
which
all
forsytes
feel
at
what
curtails
their
individual
liberties
enthusiastic
at
first
about
the
of
the
work
she
had
begun
after
a
month
to
feel
that
she
could
train
herself
so
much
better
than
others
could
train
her
and
if
holly
had
not
insisted
on
following
her
example
and
being
trained
too
she
must
inevitably
have
off
the
departure
of
jolly
and
val
with
their
troop
in
april
had
further
stiffened
her
failing
resolve
but
now
on
the
point
of
departure
the
thought
of
leaving
eric
cobbley
with
a
wife
and
two
children
adrift
in
the
cold
waters
of
an
unappreciative
world
weighed
on
her
so
that
she
was
still
in
danger
of
backing
out
the
reading
of
that
cablegram
with
its
disquieting
reality
clinched
the
matter
she
saw
herself
already
nursing
of
course
they
would
let
her
nurse
her
own
brother
wide
and
no
such
hope
poor
june
could
any
forsyte
of
her
generation
grasp
how
rude
and
brutal
life
was
ever
since
he
knew
of
his
boy
arrival
at
cape
town
the
thought
of
him
had
been
a
kind
of
recurrent
sickness
in
jolyon
he
could
not
get
reconciled
to
the
feeling
that
jolly
was
in
danger
all
the
time
the
cablegram
grave
though
it
was
was
almost
a
relief
he
was
now
safe
from
bullets
anyway
and
enteric
was
a
virulent
disease
the
times
was
full
of
deaths
therefrom
why
could
he
not
be
lying
out
there
in
that
hospital
and
his
boy
safe
at
home
the
of
his
three
children
indeed
had
quite
bewildered
jolyon
he
would
eagerly
change
places
with
jolly
because
he
loved
his
boy
but
no
such
personal
motive
was
influencing
them
he
could
only
think
that
it
marked
the
decline
of
the
forsyte
type
late
that
afternoon
holly
came
out
to
him
under
the
old
she
had
grown
up
very
much
during
these
last
months
of
hospital
training
away
from
home
and
seeing
her
approach
he
thought
has
more
sense
than
june
child
though
she
is
more
wisdom
thank
god
she
going
out
she
had
seated
herself
in
the
swing
very
silent
and
still
feels
this
thought
jolyon
much
as
i
and
seeing
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
he
said
do
take
it
to
heart
too
much
my
child
if
he
were
ill
he
might
be
in
much
greater
holly
got
out
of
the
swing
i
want
to
tell
you
something
dad
it
was
through
me
that
jolly
enlisted
and
went
how
that
when
you
were
away
in
paris
val
dartie
and
i
fell
in
love
we
used
to
ride
in
richmond
park
we
got
engaged
jolly
found
it
out
and
thought
he
ought
to
stop
it
so
he
dared
val
to
enlist
it
was
all
my
fault
dad
and
i
want
to
go
out
too
because
if
anything
happens
to
either
of
them
i
should
feel
awful
besides
i
just
as
much
trained
as
jolyon
gazed
at
her
in
a
stupefaction
that
was
tinged
with
irony
so
this
was
the
answer
to
the
riddle
he
had
been
asking
himself
and
his
three
children
were
forsytes
after
all
surely
holly
might
have
told
him
all
this
before
but
he
smothered
the
sarcastic
sayings
on
his
lips
tenderness
to
the
young
was
perhaps
the
most
sacred
article
of
his
belief
he
had
got
no
doubt
what
he
deserved
engaged
so
this
was
why
he
had
so
lost
touch
with
her
and
to
young
val
of
the
other
camp
it
was
all
terribly
distasteful
he
closed
his
easel
and
set
his
drawing
against
the
tree
have
you
told
june
yes
she
says
she
get
me
into
her
cabin
somehow
it
a
single
cabin
but
one
of
us
could
sleep
on
the
floor
if
you
consent
she
go
up
now
and
get
thought
jolyon
late
in
the
day
to
ask
for
that
but
again
he
checked
himself
you
too
young
my
dear
they
wo
let
june
knows
some
people
that
she
helped
to
go
to
cape
town
if
they
wo
let
me
nurse
yet
i
could
stay
with
them
and
go
on
training
there
let
me
go
dad
jolyon
smiled
because
he
could
have
cried
i
never
stop
anyone
from
doing
anything
he
said
holly
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
oh
dad
you
are
the
best
in
the
means
the
worst
thought
jolyon
if
he
had
ever
doubted
his
creed
of
tolerance
he
did
so
then
i
not
friendly
with
val
family
he
said
and
i
do
know
val
but
jolly
did
like
holly
looked
at
the
distance
and
said
i
love
that
settles
it
said
jolyon
dryly
then
catching
the
expression
on
her
face
he
kissed
her
with
the
thought
anything
more
pathetic
than
the
faith
of
the
young
unless
he
actually
forbade
her
going
it
was
obvious
that
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
so
he
went
up
to
town
with
june
whether
due
to
her
persistence
or
the
fact
that
the
official
they
saw
was
an
old
school
friend
of
jolyon
they
obtained
permission
for
holly
to
share
the
single
cabin
he
took
them
to
surbiton
station
the
following
evening
and
they
duly
slid
away
from
him
provided
with
money
invalid
foods
and
those
letters
of
credit
without
which
forsytes
do
not
travel
he
drove
back
to
robin
hill
under
a
brilliant
sky
to
his
late
dinner
served
with
an
added
care
by
servants
trying
to
show
him
that
they
sympathised
eaten
with
an
added
scrupulousness
to
show
them
that
he
appreciated
their
sympathy
but
it
was
a
real
relief
to
get
to
his
cigar
on
the
terrace
of
chosen
by
young
bosinney
for
shape
and
night
closing
in
around
him
so
beautiful
a
night
hardly
whispering
in
the
trees
and
smelling
so
sweet
that
it
made
him
ache
the
grass
was
drenched
with
dew
and
he
kept
to
those
flagstones
up
and
down
till
presently
it
began
to
seem
to
him
that
he
was
one
of
three
not
wheeling
but
turning
right
about
at
each
end
so
that
his
father
was
always
nearest
to
the
house
and
his
son
always
nearest
to
the
terrace
edge
each
had
an
arm
lightly
within
his
arm
he
dared
not
lift
his
hand
to
his
cigar
lest
he
should
disturb
them
and
it
burned
away
dripping
ash
on
him
till
it
dropped
from
his
lips
at
last
which
were
getting
hot
they
left
him
then
and
his
arms
felt
chilly
three
jolyons
in
one
jolyon
they
had
walked
he
stood
still
counting
the
carriage
passing
on
the
highroad
a
distant
train
the
dog
at
gage
farm
the
whispering
trees
the
groom
playing
on
his
penny
whistle
a
multitude
of
stars
up
and
silent
so
far
off
no
moon
as
yet
just
enough
light
to
show
him
the
dark
flags
and
swords
of
the
iris
flowers
along
the
terrace
favourite
flower
that
had
the
night
own
colour
on
its
curving
crumpled
petals
he
turned
round
to
the
house
big
unlighted
not
a
soul
beside
himself
to
live
in
all
that
part
of
it
stark
loneliness
he
could
not
go
on
living
here
alone
and
yet
so
long
as
there
was
beauty
why
should
a
man
feel
lonely
the
to
some
idiot
because
he
did
the
greater
the
beauty
the
greater
the
loneliness
for
at
the
back
of
beauty
was
harmony
and
at
the
back
of
harmony
beauty
could
not
comfort
if
the
soul
were
out
of
it
the
night
maddeningly
lovely
with
bloom
of
grapes
on
it
in
starshine
and
the
breath
of
grass
and
honey
coming
from
it
he
could
not
enjoy
while
she
who
was
to
him
the
life
of
beauty
its
embodiment
and
essence
was
cut
off
from
him
utterly
cut
off
now
he
felt
by
honourable
decency
he
made
a
poor
fist
of
sleeping
striving
too
hard
after
that
resignation
which
forsytes
find
difficult
to
reach
bred
to
their
own
way
and
left
so
comfortably
off
by
their
fathers
but
after
dawn
he
dozed
off
and
soon
was
dreaming
a
strange
dream
he
was
on
a
stage
with
immensely
high
rich
as
the
very
in
a
from
footlights
to
footlights
he
himself
was
very
small
a
little
black
restless
figure
roaming
up
and
down
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
he
was
not
altogether
himself
but
soames
as
well
so
that
he
was
not
only
experiencing
but
watching
this
figure
of
himself
and
soames
was
trying
to
find
a
way
out
through
the
curtains
which
heavy
and
dark
kept
him
in
several
times
he
had
crossed
in
front
of
them
before
he
saw
with
delight
a
sudden
narrow
tall
chink
of
beauty
the
colour
of
iris
flowers
like
a
glimpse
of
paradise
remote
ineffable
stepping
quickly
forward
to
pass
into
it
he
found
the
curtains
closing
before
him
bitterly
disappointed
was
it
soames
on
and
there
was
the
chink
again
through
the
parted
curtains
which
again
closed
too
soon
this
went
on
and
on
and
he
never
got
through
till
he
woke
with
the
word
irene
on
his
lips
the
dream
disturbed
him
badly
especially
that
identification
of
himself
with
soames
next
morning
finding
it
impossible
to
work
he
spent
hours
riding
jolly
horse
in
search
of
fatigue
and
on
the
second
day
he
made
up
his
mind
to
move
to
london
and
see
if
he
could
not
get
permission
to
follow
his
daughters
to
south
africa
he
had
just
begun
to
pack
the
following
morning
when
he
received
this
letter
green
hotel
june
richmond
my
dear
jolyon
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
near
i
am
to
you
paris
became
i
have
come
here
to
be
within
reach
of
your
advice
i
would
so
love
to
see
you
again
since
you
left
paris
i
do
think
i
have
met
anyone
i
could
really
talk
to
is
all
well
with
you
and
with
your
boy
no
one
knows
i
think
that
i
am
here
at
present
always
your
friend
irene
within
three
miles
of
him
again
in
flight
he
stood
with
a
very
queer
smile
on
his
lips
this
was
more
than
he
had
bargained
for
about
noon
he
set
out
on
foot
across
richmond
park
and
as
he
went
along
he
thought
park
by
jove
it
suits
us
forsytes
not
that
forsytes
lived
lived
there
save
royalty
rangers
and
the
in
richmond
park
nature
was
allowed
to
go
so
far
and
no
further
putting
up
a
brave
show
of
being
natural
seeming
to
say
at
my
are
almost
passions
very
nearly
out
of
hand
but
not
quite
of
course
the
very
hub
of
possession
is
to
possess
oneself
yes
richmond
park
possessed
itself
even
on
that
bright
day
of
june
with
arrowy
cuckoos
shifting
the
of
their
calls
and
the
wood
doves
announcing
high
summer
the
green
hotel
which
jolyon
entered
at
one
stood
nearly
opposite
that
more
famous
hostelry
the
crown
and
sceptre
it
was
modest
highly
respectable
never
out
of
cold
beef
gooseberry
tart
and
a
dowager
or
two
so
that
a
carriage
and
pair
was
almost
always
standing
before
the
door
in
a
room
draped
in
chintz
so
slippery
as
to
forbid
all
emotion
irene
was
sitting
on
a
piano
stool
covered
with
crewel
work
playing
and
gretel
out
of
an
old
score
above
her
on
a
wall
not
yet
was
a
print
of
the
queen
on
a
pony
amongst
scotch
caps
and
slain
stags

the
victorianism
of
the
room
almost
talked
and
in
her
clinging
frock
irene
seemed
to
jolyon
like
venus
emerging
from
the
shell
of
the
past
century
if
the
proprietor
had
eyes
he
said
he
would
show
you
the
door
you
have
broken
through
his
thus
lightly
he
smothered
up
an
emotional
moment
having
eaten
cold
beef
pickled
walnut
gooseberry
tart
and
drunk
they
walked
into
the
park
and
light
talk
was
succeeded
by
the
silence
jolyon
had
dreaded
you
have
told
me
about
paris
he
said
at
last
no
i
been
shadowed
for
a
long
time
one
gets
used
to
that
but
then
soames
came
by
the
little
same
story
would
i
go
back
to
him
incredible
she
had
spoken
without
raising
her
eyes
but
she
looked
up
now
those
dark
eyes
clinging
to
his
said
as
no
words
could
have
have
come
to
an
end
if
you
want
me
here
i
am
for
sheer
emotional
intensity
had
he
as
he
through
such
a
moment
the
words
i
adore
you
almost
escaped
him
then
with
a
clearness
of
which
he
would
not
have
believed
mental
vision
capable
he
saw
jolly
lying
with
a
white
face
turned
to
a
white
wall
my
boy
is
very
ill
out
there
he
said
quietly
irene
slipped
her
arm
through
his
let
walk
on
i
no
miserable
explanation
to
attempt
she
had
understood
and
they
walked
on
among
the
bracken
already
between
the
and
the
talking
of
jolly
he
left
her
two
hours
later
at
the
richmond
hill
gate
and
turned
towards
home
knows
of
my
feeling
for
her
then
he
thought
of
course
one
could
not
keep
knowledge
of
that
from
such
a
woman
chapter
the
river
jolly
was
tired
to
death
of
dreams
they
had
left
him
now
too
wan
and
weak
to
dream
again
left
him
to
lie
torpid
faintly
remembering
things
just
able
to
turn
his
eyes
and
gaze
through
the
window
near
his
cot
at
the
trickle
of
river
running
by
in
the
sands
at
the
straggling
of
the
karoo
beyond
he
knew
what
the
karoo
was
now
even
if
he
had
not
seen
a
boer
roll
over
like
a
rabbit
or
heard
the
whine
of
flying
bullets
this
pestilence
had
sneaked
on
him
before
he
had
smelled
powder
a
thirsty
day
and
a
rash
drink
or
perhaps
a
tainted
knew
not
he
who
had
not
even
strength
left
to
grudge
the
evil
thing
its
enough
to
know
that
there
were
many
lying
here
with
him
that
he
was
sore
with
frenzied
dreaming
just
enough
to
watch
that
thread
of
river
and
be
able
to
remember
faintly
those
things
the
sun
was
nearly
down
it
would
be
cooler
soon
he
would
have
liked
to
know
the
feel
his
old
watch
so
to
hear
the
repeater
strike
it
would
have
been
friendly
he
had
not
even
strength
to
remember
that
the
old
watch
was
last
wound
the
day
he
began
to
lie
here
the
pulse
of
his
brain
beat
so
feebly
that
faces
which
came
and
went
nurse
doctor
orderly
were
indistinguishable
just
one
indifferent
face
and
the
words
spoken
about
him
meant
all
the
same
thing
and
that
almost
nothing
those
things
he
used
to
do

throughout
two
hours
of
sustained
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
colliery
company
which
declining
almost
from
the
moment
of
old
jolyon
retirement
from
the
chairmanship
had
lately
run
down
so
fast
that
there
was
now
nothing
for
it
but
a
he
took
the
letter
out
to
lunch
at
his
city
club
sacred
to
him
for
the
meals
he
had
eaten
there
with
his
father
in
the
early
seventies
when
james
used
to
like
him
to
come
and
see
for
himself
the
nature
of
his
future
life
here
in
a
remote
corner
before
a
plate
of
roast
mutton
and
mashed
potato
he
read
dear
sir
in
accordance
with
your
suggestion
we
have
duly
taken
the
matter
up
at
the
other
end
with
gratifying
results
observation
of
has
enabled
us
to
locate
at
the
green
hotel
richmond
the
two
have
been
observed
to
meet
daily
during
the
past
week
in
richmond
park
nothing
absolutely
crucial
has
so
far
been
notified
but
in
conjunction
with
what
we
had
from
paris
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
am
confident
we
could
now
satisfy
the
court
we
shall
of
course
continue
to
watch
the
matter
until
we
hear
from
you
very
faithfully
yours
claud
soames
read
it
through
twice
and
beckoned
to
the
waiter
take
this
away
it
shall
i
bring
you
some
more
sir
no
get
me
some
coffee
in
the
other
and
paying
for
what
he
had
not
eaten
he
went
out
passing
two
acquaintances
without
sign
of
recognition
the
court
he
thought
sitting
at
a
little
round
marble
table
with
the
coffee
before
him
that
fellow
jolyon
he
poured
out
his
coffee
sweetened
and
drank
it
he
would
disgrace
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
own
children
and
rising
with
that
resolution
hot
within
him
he
found
for
the
first
time
the
inconvenience
of
being
his
own
solicitor
he
could
not
treat
this
scandalous
matter
in
his
own
office
he
must
commit
the
soul
of
his
private
dignity
to
a
stranger
some
other
professional
dealer
in
family
dishonour
who
was
there
he
could
go
to
linkman
and
laver
in
budge
row
not
too
conspicuous
only
nodding
acquaintances
but
before
he
saw
them
he
must
see
polteed
again
but
at
this
thought
soames
had
a
moment
of
sheer
weakness
to
part
with
his
secret
how
find
the
words
how
subject
himself
to
contempt
and
secret
laughter
yet
after
all
the
fellow
knew
yes
he
knew
and
feeling
that
he
must
finish
with
it
now
he
took
a
cab
into
the
west
end
in
this
hot
weather
the
window
of
polteed
room
was
positively
open
and
the
only
precaution
was
a
wire
gauze
preventing
the
intrusion
of
flies
two
or
three
had
tried
to
come
in
and
been
caught
so
that
they
seemed
to
be
clinging
there
with
the
intention
of
being
devoured
presently
polteed
following
the
direction
of
his
client
eye
rose
apologetically
and
closed
the
window
ass
thought
soames
like
all
who
fundamentally
believe
in
themselves
he
was
rising
to
the
occasion
and
with
his
little
sideway
smile
he
said
i
had
your
letter
i
going
to
act
i
suppose
you
know
who
the
lady
you
been
watching
really
is
expression
at
that
moment
was
a
masterpiece
it
so
clearly
said
what
do
you
think
but
mere
professional
knowledge
i
assure
forgive
it
he
made
a
little
half
airy
movement
with
his
hand
as
who
should
say
things
will
happen
to
us
all
very
well
then
said
soames
moistening
his
lips
there
no
need
to
say
more
i
instructing
linkman
and
laver
of
budge
row
to
act
for
me
i
do
want
to
hear
your
evidence
but
kindly
make
your
report
to
them
at
five
and
continue
to
observe
the
utmost
polteed
half
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
comply
at
once
my
dear
sir
he
said
are
you
convinced
asked
soames
with
sudden
energy
that
there
is
enough
the
faintest
movement
occurred
to
polteed
shoulders
you
can
risk
it
he
murmured
with
what
we
have
and
human
nature
you
can
risk
soames
rose
you
will
ask
for
linkman
thanks
do
get
he
could
not
bear
polteed
to
slide
as
usual
between
him
and
the
door
in
the
sunlight
of
piccadilly
he
wiped
his
forehead
this
had
been
the
worst
of
could
stand
the
strangers
better
and
he
went
back
into
the
city
to
do
what
still
lay
before
him
that
evening
in
park
lane
watching
his
father
dine
he
was
overwhelmed
by
his
old
longing
for
a
son
to
watch
him
eat
as
he
went
down
the
years
to
be
taken
on
his
knee
as
james
on
a
time
had
been
wont
to
take
him
a
son
of
his
own
begetting
who
could
understand
him
because
he
was
the
same
flesh
and
and
comfort
him
and
become
more
rich
and
cultured
than
himself
because
he
would
start
even
better
off
to
get
that
thin
grey
figure
sitting
be
quite
alone
with
possessions
heaping
up
around
him
to
take
no
interest
in
anything
because
it
had
no
future
and
must
pass
away
from
him
to
hands
and
mouths
and
eyes
for
whom
he
cared
no
jot
no
he
would
force
it
through
now
and
be
free
to
marry
and
have
a
son
to
care
for
him
before
he
grew
to
be
like
the
old
old
man
his
father
wistfully
watching
now
his
sweetbread
now
his
son
in
that
mood
he
went
up
to
bed
but
lying
warm
between
those
fine
linen
sheets
of
emily
providing
he
was
visited
by
memories
and
torture
visions
of
irene
almost
the
solid
feeling
of
her
body
beset
him
why
had
he
ever
been
fool
enough
to
see
her
again
and
let
this
flood
back
on
him
so
that
it
was
pain
to
think
of
her
with
that
stealing
fellow
chapter
summer
day
his
boy
was
seldom
absent
from
jolyon
mind
in
the
days
which
followed
the
first
walk
with
irene
in
richmond
park
no
further
news
had
come
enquiries
at
the
war
office
elicited
nothing
nor
could
he
expect
to
hear
from
june
and
holly
for
three
weeks
at
least
in
these
days
he
felt
how
insufficient
were
his
memories
of
jolly
and
what
an
amateur
of
a
father
he
had
been
there
was
not
a
single
memory
in
which
anger
played
a
part
not
one
reconciliation
because
there
had
never
been
a
rupture
nor
one
confidence
not
even
when
jolly
mother
died
nothing
but
affection
he
had
been
too
afraid
of
committing
himself
in
any
direction
for
fear
of
losing
his
liberty
or
interfering
with
that
of
his
boy
only
in
irene
presence
had
he
relief
highly
complicated
by
the
perception
of
how
divided
he
was
between
her
and
his
son
with
jolly
was
bound
up
all
that
sense
of
continuity
and
social
creed
of
which
he
had
drunk
deeply
in
his
youth
and
again
during
his
boy
public
school
and
varsity
that
sense
of
not
going
back
on
what
father
and
son
expected
of
each
other
with
irene
was
bound
up
all
his
delight
in
beauty
and
in
nature
and
he
seemed
to
know
less
and
less
which
was
the
stronger
within
him
from
such
sentimental
paralysis
he
was
rudely
awakened
however
one
afternoon
just
as
he
was
starting
off
to
richmond
by
a
young
man
with
a
bicycle
and
a
face
oddly
familiar
who
came
forward
faintly
smiling
mr
jolyon
forsyte
thank
you
placing
an
envelope
in
jolyon
hand
he
wheeled
off
the
path
and
rode
away
bewildered
jolyon
opened
it
admiralty
probate
and
divorce
forsyte
forsyte
and
forsyte
a
sensation
of
shame
and
disgust
was
followed
by
the
instant
reaction
here
the
very
thing
you
want
and
you
do
like
it
but
she
must
have
had
one
too
and
he
must
go
to
her
at
once
he
turned
things
over
as
he
went
along
it
was
an
ironical
business
for
whatever
the
scriptures
said
about
the
heart
it
took
more
than
mere
longings
to
satisfy
the
law
they
could
perfectly
well
defend
this
suit
or
at
least
in
good
faith
try
to
but
the
idea
of
doing
so
revolted
jolyon
if
not
her
lover
in
deed
he
was
in
desire
and
he
knew
that
she
was
ready
to
come
to
him
her
face
had
told
him
so
not
that
he
exaggerated
her
feeling
for
him
she
had
had
her
grand
passion
and
he
could
not
expect
another
from
her
at
his
age
but
she
had
trust
in
him
affection
for
him
and
must
feel
that
he
would
be
a
refuge
surely
she
would
not
ask
him
to
defend
the
suit
knowing
that
he
adored
her
thank
heaven
she
had
not
that
maddening
british
conscientiousness
which
refused
happiness
for
the
sake
of
refusing
she
must
rejoice
at
this
chance
of
being
free
after
seventeen
years
of
death
in
life
as
to
publicity
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
to
defend
the
suit
would
not
take
away
the
slur
jolyon
had
all
the
proper
feeling
of
a
forsyte
whose
privacy
is
threatened
if
he
was
to
be
hung
by
the
law
by
all
means
let
it
be
for
a
sheep
moreover
the
notion
of
standing
in
a
witness
box
and
swearing
to
the
truth
that
no
gesture
not
even
a
word
of
love
had
passed
between
them
seemed
to
him
more
degrading
than
to
take
the
tacit
stigma
of
being
an
truly
degrading
considering
the
feeling
in
his
heart
and
just
as
bad
and
painful
for
his
children
the
thought
of
explaining
away
if
he
could
before
a
judge
and
twelve
average
englishmen
their
meetings
in
paris
and
the
walks
in
richmond
park
horrified
him
the
brutality
and
hypocritical
censoriousness
of
the
whole
process
the
probability
that
they
would
not
be
mere
vision
of
her
whom
he
looked
on
as
the
embodiment
of
nature
and
of
beauty
standing
there
before
all
those
suspicious
gloating
eyes
was
hideous
to
him
no
no
to
defend
a
suit
only
made
a
london
holiday
and
sold
the
newspapers
a
thousand
times
better
accept
what
soames
and
the
gods
had
sent
he
thought
honestly
knows
whether
even
for
my
sake
i
could
have
stood
this
state
of
things
much
longer
anyway
her
neck
will
be
out
of
chancery
at
last
thus
absorbed
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
heavy
heat
the
sky
had
become
overcast
purplish
with
little
streaks
of
white
a
heavy
plashed
a
little
star
pattern
in
the
dust
of
the
road
as
he
entered
the
park
he
thought
i
hope
she
not
come
to
meet
me
there
a
ducking
up
there
but
at
that
very
minute
he
saw
irene
coming
towards
the
gate
must
scuttle
back
to
robin
hill
he
thought
the
storm
had
passed
over
the
poultry
at
four
bringing
welcome
distraction
to
the
clerks
in
every
office
soames
was
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
when
a
note
was
brought
in
to
him
dear
sir
forsyte
forsyte
and
forsyte
in
accordance
with
your
instructions
we
beg
to
inform
you
that
we
personally
served
the
respondent
and
in
this
suit
at
richmond
and
robin
hill
respectively
faithfully
yours
linkman
and
for
some
minutes
soames
stared
at
that
note
ever
since
he
had
given
those
instructions
he
had
been
tempted
to
annul
them
it
was
so
scandalous
such
a
general
disgrace
the
evidence
too
what
he
had
heard
of
it
had
never
seemed
to
him
conclusive
somehow
he
believed
less
and
less
that
those
two
had
gone
all
lengths
but
this
of
course
would
drive
them
to
it
and
he
suffered
from
the
thought
that
fellow
to
have
her
love
where
he
had
failed
was
it
too
late
now
that
they
had
been
brought
up
sharp
by
service
of
this
petition
had
he
not
a
lever
with
which
he
could
force
them
apart
if
i
do
act
at
once
he
thought
will
be
too
late
now
they
had
this
thing
i
go
and
see
him
i
go
down
and
sick
with
nervous
anxiety
he
sent
out
for
one
of
the
it
might
take
a
long
time
to
run
that
fellow
to
ground
and
goodness
knew
what
decision
they
might
come
to
after
such
a
shock
i
were
a
theatrical
ass
he
thought
suppose
i
should
be
taking
a
or
a
pistol
or
something
he
took
instead
a
bundle
of
papers
in
the
case
of
versus
wake
intending
to
read
them
on
the
way
down
he
did
not
even
open
them
but
sat
quite
still
jolted
and
jarred
unconscious
of
the
draught
down
the
back
of
his
neck
or
the
smell
of
petrol
he
must
be
guided
by
the
fellow
attitude
the
great
thing
was
to
keep
his
head
london
had
already
begun
to
disgorge
its
workers
as
he
neared
putney
bridge
the
was
on
the
move
outwards
what
a
lot
of
ants
all
with
a
living
to
get
holding
on
by
their
eyelids
in
the
great
scramble
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
soames
thought
could
let
go
if
i
liked
nothing
could
touch
me
i
could
snap
my
fingers
live
as
i
myself
no
one
could
not
live
as
he
had
and
just
drop
it
down
in
capua
to
spend
the
money
and
reputation
he
had
made
a
man
life
was
what
he
possessed
and
sought
to
possess
only
fools
thought
and
socialists
and
libertines
the
cab
was
passing
villas
now
going
a
great
pace
miles
an
hour
i
should
think
he
mused
take
people
out
of
town
to
live
and
he
thought
of
its
bearing
on
the
portions
of
london
owned
by
his
himself
had
never
taken
to
that
form
of
investment
the
gambler
in
him
having
all
the
outlet
needed
in
his
pictures
and
the
cab
sped
on
down
the
hill
past
wimbledon
common
this
interview
surely
a
man
of
with
children
and
hung
on
the
line
would
not
be
reckless
wo
want
to
disgrace
the
family
he
thought
was
as
fond
of
his
father
as
i
am
of
mine
and
they
were
brothers
that
woman
brings
is
it
in
her
i
never
known
the
cab
branched
off
along
the
side
of
a
wood
and
he
heard
a
late
cuckoo
calling
almost
the
first
he
had
heard
that
year
he
was
now
almost
opposite
the
site
he
had
originally
chosen
for
his
house
and
which
had
been
so
unceremoniously
rejected
by
bosinney
in
favour
of
his
own
choice
he
began
passing
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
and
hands
taking
deep
breaths
to
give
him
steadiness
one
head
he
thought
one
head
the
cab
turned
in
at
the
drive
which
might
have
been
his
own
and
the
sound
of
music
met
him
he
had
forgotten
the
fellow
daughters
i
may
be
out
again
directly
he
said
to
the
driver
or
i
may
be
kept
some
time
and
he
rang
the
bell
following
the
maid
through
the
curtains
into
the
inner
hall
he
felt
relieved
that
the
impact
of
this
meeting
would
be
broken
by
june
or
holly
whichever
was
playing
in
there
so
that
with
complete
surprise
he
saw
irene
at
the
piano
and
jolyon
sitting
in
an
armchair
listening
they
both
stood
up
blood
surged
into
soames
brain
and
all
his
resolution
to
be
guided
by
this
or
that
left
him
utterly
the
look
of
his
farmer
forsytes
down
by
the
sea
from
dosset
out
of
his
face
very
pretty
he
said
he
heard
the
fellow
murmur
this
is
hardly
the
go
to
the
study
if
you
do
and
they
both
passed
him
through
the
curtain
opening
in
the
little
room
to
which
he
followed
them
irene
stood
by
the
open
window
and
the
close
to
her
by
a
big
chair
soames
pulled
the
door
to
behind
him
with
a
slam
the
sound
carried
him
back
all
those
years
to
the
day
when
he
had
shut
out
him
out
for
meddling
with
his
affairs
well
he
said
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourselves
the
fellow
had
the
effrontery
to
smile
what
we
have
received
has
taken
away
your
right
to
ask
i
should
imagine
you
will
be
glad
to
have
your
neck
out
of
oh
said
soames
you
think
so
i
came
to
tell
you
that
i
divorce
her
with
every
circumstance
of
disgrace
to
you
both
unless
you
swear
to
keep
clear
of
each
other
from
now
he
was
astonished
at
his
fluency
because
his
mind
was
stammering
and
his
hands
twitching
neither
of
them
answered
but
their
faces
seemed
to
him
as
if
contemptuous
well
he
said
her
lips
moved
but
jolyon
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
let
her
alone
said
soames
furiously
irene
will
you
swear
it
oh
and
you
still
so
then
you
guilty
are
you
yes
it
was
irene
speaking
in
that
serene
voice
with
that
unreached
air
which
had
maddened
him
so
often
and
carried
beyond
himself
he
cried
you
are
a
devil
go
out
leave
this
house
or
i
do
you
an
that
fellow
to
talk
of
injuries
did
he
know
how
near
his
throat
was
to
being
scragged
a
trustee
he
said
embezzling
trust
property
a
thief
stealing
his
cousin
call
me
what
you
like
you
have
chosen
your
part
we
have
chosen
ours
go
out
if
he
had
brought
a
weapon
soames
might
have
used
it
at
that
moment
i
make
you
pay
he
said
i
shall
be
very
at
that
deadly
turning
of
the
meaning
of
his
speech
by
the
son
of
him
who
had
nicknamed
him
man
of
property
soames
stood
glaring
it
was
ridiculous
there
they
were
kept
from
violence
by
some
secret
force
no
blow
possible
no
words
to
meet
the
case
but
he
could
not
did
not
know
how
to
turn
and
go
away
his
eyes
fastened
on
irene
last
time
he
would
ever
see
that
fatal
last
time
no
doubt
you
he
said
suddenly
i
hope
you
treat
him
as
you
treated
he
saw
her
wince
and
with
a
sensation
not
quite
triumph
not
quite
relief
he
wrenched
open
the
door
passed
out
through
the
hall
and
got
into
his
cab
he
lolled
against
the
cushion
with
his
eyes
shut
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
so
near
to
murderous
violence
never
so
thrown
away
the
restraint
which
was
his
second
nature
he
had
a
stripped
and
naked
feeling
as
if
all
virtue
had
gone
out
of
meaningless
work
sunlight
streamed
in
on
him
but
he
felt
cold
the
scene
he
had
passed
through
had
gone
from
him
already
what
was
before
him
would
not
materialise
he
could
catch
on
to
nothing
and
he
felt
frightened
as
if
he
had
been
hanging
over
the
edge
of
a
precipice
as
if
with
another
turn
of
the
screw
sanity
would
have
failed
him
not
fit
for
it
he
thought
not
fit
for
it
the
cab
sped
on
and
in
mechanical
procession
trees
houses
people
passed
but
had
no
significance
feel
very
queer
he
thought
take
a
turkish
been
very
near
to
something
it
wo
do
the
cab
whirred
its
way
back
over
the
bridge
up
the
fulham
road
along
the
park
to
the
hammam
said
soames
curious
that
on
so
warm
a
summer
day
heat
should
be
so
comforting
crossing
into
the
hot
room
he
met
george
forsyte
coming
out
red
and
glistening
hallo
said
george
what
are
you
training
for
you
not
got
much
buffoon
soames
passed
him
with
his
sideway
smile
lying
back
rubbing
his
skin
uneasily
for
the
first
signs
of
perspiration
he
thought
them
laugh
i
wo
feel
anything
i
ca
stand
violence
it
not
good
for
me
chapter
summer
night
soames
left
dead
silence
in
the
little
study
thank
you
for
that
good
lie
said
jolyon
suddenly
come
air
in
here
is
not
what
it
was
in
front
of
a
long
high
southerly
wall
on
which
were
trained
the
two
walked
up
and
down
in
silence
old
jolyon
had
planted
some
at
intervals
between
this
grassy
terrace
and
the
dipping
meadow
full
of
buttercups
and
daisies
for
twelve
years
they
had
flourished
till
their
dark
spiral
shapes
had
quite
a
look
of
italy
birds
fluttered
softly
in
the
wet
shrubbery
the
swallows
swooped
past
with
a
sheen
on
their
swift
little
bodies
the
grass
felt
springy
beneath
the
feet
its
green
refreshed
butterflies
chased
each
other
after
that
painful
scene
the
quiet
of
nature
was
wonderfully
poignant
under
the
wall
ran
a
narrow
strip
of
full
of
mignonette
and
pansies
and
from
the
bees
came
a
low
hum
in
which
all
other
sounds
were
mooing
of
a
cow
deprived
of
her
calf
the
calling
of
a
cuckoo
from
an
at
the
bottom
of
the
meadow
who
would
have
thought
that
behind
them
within
ten
miles
london
london
of
the
forsytes
with
its
wealth
its
misery
its
dirt
and
noise
its
jumbled
stone
isles
of
beauty
its
grey
sea
of
hideous
brick
and
stucco
that
london
which
had
seen
irene
early
tragedy
and
jolyon
own
hard
days
that
web
that
princely
workhouse
of
the
possessive
instinct
and
while
they
walked
jolyon
pondered
those
words
hope
you
treat
him
as
you
treated
me
that
would
depend
on
himself
could
he
trust
himself
did
nature
permit
a
forsyte
not
to
make
a
slave
of
what
he
adored
could
beauty
be
confided
to
him
or
should
she
not
be
just
a
visitor
coming
when
she
would
possessed
for
moments
which
passed
to
return
only
at
her
own
choosing
are
a
breed
of
spoilers
thought
jolyon
and
greedy
the
bloom
of
life
is
not
safe
with
us
let
her
come
to
me
as
she
will
when
she
will
not
at
all
if
she
will
not
let
me
be
just
her
her
her
cage
she
was
the
chink
of
beauty
in
his
dream
was
he
to
pass
through
the
curtains
now
and
reach
her
was
the
rich
stuff
of
many
possessions
the
close
encircling
fabric
of
the
possessive
instinct
walling
in
that
little
black
figure
of
himself
and
it
to
be
rent
so
that
he
could
pass
through
into
his
vision
find
there
something
not
of
the
senses
only
me
he
thought
let
me
only
know
how
not
to
grasp
and
destroy
but
at
dinner
there
were
plans
to
be
made
she
would
go
back
to
the
hotel
but
tomorrow
he
would
take
her
up
to
london
he
must
instruct
his
herring
not
a
finger
must
be
raised
to
hinder
the
process
of
the
law
damages
exemplary
judicial
strictures
costs
what
they
it
go
through
at
the
first
moment
so
that
her
neck
might
be
out
of
chancery
at
last
he
would
see
would
go
and
see
him
together
and
leaving
no
doubt
no
difficulty
about
evidence
making
the
lie
she
had
told
into
the
truth
he
looked
round
at
her
and
it
seemed
to
his
adoring
eyes
that
more
than
a
woman
was
sitting
there
the
spirit
of
universal
beauty
deep
mysterious
which
the
old
painters
titian
giorgione
botticelli
had
known
how
to
capture
and
transfer
to
the
faces
of
their
flying
beauty
seemed
to
him
imprinted
on
her
brow
her
hair
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
this
is
to
be
mine
he
thought
frightens
me
after
dinner
they
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
to
have
coffee
they
sat
there
long
the
evening
was
so
lovely
watching
the
summer
night
come
very
slowly
on
it
was
still
warm
and
the
air
smelled
of
lime
this
summer
two
bats
were
flighting
with
the
faint
mysterious
little
noise
they
make
he
had
placed
the
chairs
in
front
of
the
study
window
and
moths
flew
past
to
visit
the
discreet
light
in
there
there
was
no
wind
and
not
a
whisper
in
the
old
twenty
yards
away
the
moon
rose
from
behind
the
copse
nearly
full
and
the
two
lights
struggled
till
moonlight
conquered
changing
the
colour
and
quality
of
all
the
garden
stealing
along
the
flagstones
reaching
their
feet
climbing
up
changing
their
faces
well
said
jolyon
at
last
you
be
tired
dear
we
better
start
the
maid
will
show
you
holly
room
and
he
rang
the
study
bell
the
maid
who
came
handed
him
a
telegram
watching
her
take
irene
away
he
thought
must
have
come
an
hour
or
more
ago
and
she
did
bring
it
out
to
us
that
shows
well
we
be
hung
for
a
sheep
soon
and
opening
the
telegram
he
read
jolyon
forsyte
robin
son
passed
painlessly
away
on
june
deep
sympathy
name
unknown
to
him
he
dropped
it
spun
round
stood
motionless
the
moon
shone
in
on
him
a
moth
flew
in
his
face
the
first
day
of
all
that
he
had
not
thought
almost
ceaselessly
of
jolly
he
went
blindly
towards
the
window
struck
against
the
old
sank
down
on
to
the
arm
of
it
he
sat
there
huddled
forward
staring
into
the
night
gone
out
like
a
candle
flame
far
from
home
from
love
all
by
himself
in
the
dark
his
boy
from
a
little
chap
always
so
good
to
friendly
twenty
years
old
and
cut
down
like
have
no
life
at
all
did
really
know
him
he
thought
he
did
know
me
but
we
loved
each
other
it
only
love
that
matters
to
die
out
home
this
seemed
to
his
forsyte
heart
more
painful
more
pitiful
than
death
itself
no
shelter
no
protection
no
love
at
the
last
and
all
the
deeply
rooted
clanship
in
him
the
family
feeling
and
essential
clinging
to
his
own
flesh
and
blood
which
had
been
so
strong
in
old
jolyon
was
so
strong
in
all
the
outraged
cut
and
torn
by
his
boy
lonely
passing
better
far
if
he
had
died
in
battle
without
time
to
long
for
them
to
come
to
him
to
call
out
for
them
perhaps
in
his
delirium
the
moon
had
passed
behind
the
now
endowing
it
with
uncanny
life
so
that
it
seemed
watching
his
boy
had
been
so
fond
of
climbing
out
of
which
he
had
once
fallen
and
hurt
himself
and
had
cried
the
door
creaked
he
saw
irene
come
in
pick
up
the
telegram
and
read
it
he
heard
the
faint
rustle
of
her
dress
she
sank
on
her
knees
close
to
him
and
he
forced
himself
to
smile
at
her
she
stretched
up
her
arms
and
drew
his
head
down
on
her
shoulder
the
perfume
and
warmth
of
her
encircled
him
her
presence
gained
slowly
his
whole
being
chapter
in
waiting
sweated
to
serenity
soames
dined
at
the
remove
and
turned
his
face
toward
park
lane
his
father
had
been
unwell
lately
this
would
have
to
be
kept
from
him
never
till
that
moment
had
he
realised
how
much
the
dread
of
bringing
james
grey
hairs
down
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
had
counted
with
him
how
intimately
it
was
bound
up
with
his
own
shrinking
from
scandal
his
affection
for
his
father
always
deep
had
increased
of
late
years
with
the
knowledge
that
james
looked
on
him
as
the
real
prop
of
his
decline
it
seemed
pitiful
that
one
who
had
been
so
careful
all
his
life
and
done
so
much
for
the
family
that
it
was
almost
a
byword
for
solid
wealthy
at
his
last
gasp
have
to
see
it
in
all
the
newspapers
this
was
like
lending
a
hand
to
death
that
final
enemy
of
forsytes
must
tell
mother
he
thought
when
it
comes
on
we
must
keep
the
papers
from
him
somehow
he
sees
hardly
anyone
letting
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
he
was
beginning
to
ascend
he
stairs
when
he
became
conscious
of
commotion
on
the
landing
his
mother
voice
was
saying
now
james
you
catch
cold
why
ca
you
wait
quietly
his
father
answering
wait
i
always
waiting
why
does
he
come
in
you
can
speak
to
him
morning
instead
of
making
a
guy
of
yourself
on
the
he
go
up
to
bed
i
should
wonder
i
sha
now
come
back
to
bed
um
i
might
die
before
morning
for
all
you
can
you
sha
have
to
wait
till
morning
i
go
down
and
bring
him
up
do
fuss
there
you
so
he
may
come
in
at
well
if
he
does
come
in
you
wo
catch
him
by
standing
out
here
in
your
soames
rounded
the
last
bend
and
came
in
sight
of
his
tall
figure
wrapped
in
a
brown
silk
quilted
gown
stooping
over
the
balustrade
above
light
fell
on
his
silvery
hair
and
whiskers
investing
his
head
with
a
sort
of
halo
here
he
is
he
heard
him
say
in
a
voice
which
sounded
injured
and
his
mother
comfortable
answer
from
the
bedroom
door
that
all
right
come
in
and
i
brush
your
james
extended
a
thin
crooked
finger
oddly
like
the
beckoning
of
a
skeleton
and
passed
through
the
doorway
of
his
bedroom
is
it
thought
soames
has
he
got
hold
of
now
his
father
was
sitting
before
the
sideways
to
the
mirror
while
emily
slowly
passed
two
brushes
through
and
through
his
hair
she
would
do
this
several
times
a
day
for
it
had
on
him
something
of
the
effect
produced
on
a
cat
by
scratching
between
its
ears
there
you
are
he
said
i
been
soames
stroked
his
shoulder
and
taking
up
a
silver
examined
the
mark
on
it
well
he
said
you
looking
james
shook
his
head
i
want
to
say
something
your
mother
has
he
announced
emily
ignorance
of
what
he
had
told
her
as
if
it
were
a
grievance
your
father
been
in
a
great
state
all
the
evening
i
sure
i
know
what
the
faint
of
the
brushes
continued
the
soothing
of
her
voice
no
you
know
nothing
said
james
soames
can
tell
and
fixing
his
grey
eyes
in
which
there
was
a
look
of
strain
uncomfortable
to
watch
on
his
son
he
muttered
i
getting
on
soames
at
my
age
i
ca
tell
i
might
die
any
time
there
be
a
lot
of
money
there
rachel
and
cicely
got
no
children
and
val
out
chap
his
father
will
get
hold
of
all
he
can
and
somebody
pick
up
imogen
i
should
soames
listened
had
heard
all
this
before
went
the
brushes
if
that
all
said
emily
all
cried
james
it
nothing
i
coming
to
and
again
his
eyes
strained
pitifully
at
soames
it
you
my
boy
he
said
suddenly
you
ought
to
get
a
that
word
from
those
of
all
lips
was
almost
too
much
for
composure
his
eyes
reconcentrated
themselves
quickly
on
the
buttonhook
and
as
if
in
apology
james
hurried
on
i
do
know
what
become
of
say
she
abroad
your
uncle
swithin
used
to
admire
was
a
funny
so
he
always
alluded
to
his
dead
stout
and
the
lean
of
it
they
had
been
called
she
would
be
alone
i
should
and
with
that
of
the
effect
of
beauty
on
human
nature
he
was
silent
watching
his
son
with
eyes
doubting
as
a
bird
soames
too
was
silent
went
the
brushes
come
james
soames
knows
best
it
his
ah
said
james
and
the
word
came
from
deep
down
but
there
all
my
money
and
there
it
to
go
to
and
when
he
dies
the
name
goes
soames
replaced
the
on
the
lace
and
pink
silk
of
the
coverlet
the
name
said
emily
there
are
all
the
other
as
if
that
helped
me
muttered
james
i
shall
be
in
my
grave
and
there
be
nobody
unless
he
marries
you
quite
right
said
soames
quietly
i
getting
a
james
eyes
almost
started
from
his
head
what
he
cried
there
nobody
tells
me
well
said
emily
who
would
have
imagined
you
wanted
it
my
dear
boy
that
is
a
surprise
after
all
these
it
be
a
scandal
muttered
james
as
if
to
himself
but
i
help
that
do
brush
so
hard
when
it
come
on
before
the
long
vacation
it
not
james
lips
moved
in
secret
calculation
i
sha
live
to
see
my
grandson
he
muttered
emily
ceased
brushing
of
course
you
will
james
soames
will
be
as
quick
as
he
there
was
a
long
silence
till
james
reached
out
his
arm
here
let
have
the
and
putting
it
to
his
nose
he
moved
his
forehead
in
the
direction
of
his
son
soames
bent
over
and
kissed
that
brow
just
where
the
hair
began
a
relaxing
quiver
passed
over
james
face
as
though
the
wheels
of
anxiety
within
were
running
down
i
get
to
bed
he
said
i
sha
want
to
see
the
papers
when
that
comes
they
a
morbid
lot
i
ca
pay
attention
to
them
i
too
queerly
affected
soames
went
to
the
door
he
heard
his
father
say
here
i
tired
i
say
a
prayer
in
and
his
mother
answering
that
right
james
it
be
ever
so
much
more
chapter
of
the
web
on
forsyte
the
announcement
of
jolly
death
among
a
batch
of
troopers
caused
mixed
sensation
strange
to
read
that
jolyon
forsyte
fifth
of
the
name
in
direct
descent
had
died
of
disease
in
the
service
of
his
country
and
not
be
able
to
feel
it
personally
it
revived
the
old
grudge
against
his
father
for
having
estranged
himself
for
such
was
still
the
prestige
of
old
jolyon
that
the
other
forsytes
could
never
quite
feel
as
might
have
been
expected
that
it
was
they
who
had
cut
off
his
descendants
for
irregularity
the
news
increased
of
course
the
interest
and
anxiety
about
val
but
then
val
name
was
dartie
and
even
if
he
were
killed
in
battle
or
got
the
victoria
cross
it
would
not
be
at
all
the
same
as
if
his
name
were
forsyte
not
even
casualty
or
glory
to
the
haymans
would
be
really
satisfactory
family
pride
felt
defrauded
how
the
rumour
arose
then
that
very
dreadful
my
dear
was
pending
no
one
least
of
all
soames
could
tell
secret
as
he
kept
everything
possibly
some
eye
had
seen
forsyte
and
forsyte
in
the
cause
list
and
had
added
it
to
in
paris
with
a
fair
beard
possibly
some
wall
at
park
lane
had
ears
the
fact
remained
that
it
was
among
the
old
discussed
among
the
family
pride
must
soon
receive
a
blow
soames
paying
one
of
his
sunday
visits
to
it
with
the
feeling
that
after
the
suit
came
on
he
would
be
paying
no
knowledge
in
the
air
as
he
came
in
nobody
of
course
dared
speak
of
it
before
him
but
each
of
the
four
other
forsytes
present
held
their
breath
aware
that
nothing
could
prevent
aunt
juley
from
making
them
all
uncomfortable
she
looked
so
piteously
at
soames
she
checked
herself
on
the
point
of
speech
so
often
that
aunt
hester
excused
herself
and
said
she
must
go
and
bathe
timothy
had
a
sty
coming
soames
impassive
slightly
supercilious
did
not
stay
long
he
went
out
with
a
curse
stifled
behind
his
pale
just
smiling
lips
fortunately
for
the
peace
of
his
mind
cruelly
tortured
by
the
coming
scandal
he
was
kept
busy
day
and
night
with
plans
for
his
he
had
come
to
that
grim
conclusion
to
go
on
seeing
all
those
people
who
had
known
him
as
a
chap
an
astute
the
fastidiousness
and
pride
which
was
so
strangely
so
inextricably
blended
in
him
with
possessive
obtuseness
revolted
against
the
thought
he
would
retire
live
privately
go
on
buying
pictures
make
a
great
name
as
a
all
his
heart
was
more
in
that
than
it
had
ever
been
in
law
in
pursuance
of
this
now
fixed
resolve
he
had
to
get
ready
to
amalgamate
his
business
with
another
firm
without
letting
people
know
for
that
would
excite
curiosity
and
make
humiliation
cast
its
shadow
before
he
had
pitched
on
the
firm
of
cuthcott
holliday
and
kingson
two
of
whom
were
dead
the
full
name
after
the
amalgamation
would
therefore
be
cuthcott
holliday
kingson
forsyte
bustard
and
forsyte
but
after
debate
as
to
which
of
the
dead
still
had
any
influence
with
the
living
it
was
decided
to
reduce
the
title
to
cuthcott
kingson
and
forsyte
of
whom
kingson
would
be
the
active
and
soames
the
sleeping
partner
for
leaving
his
name
prestige
and
clients
behind
him
soames
would
receive
considerable
value
one
night
as
befitted
a
man
who
had
arrived
at
so
important
a
stage
of
his
career
he
made
a
calculation
of
what
he
was
worth
and
after
writing
off
liberally
for
depreciation
by
the
war
found
his
value
to
be
some
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
pounds
at
his
father
death
which
could
not
alas
be
delayed
much
longer
he
must
come
into
at
least
another
fifty
thousand
and
his
yearly
expenditure
at
present
just
reached
two
standing
among
his
pictures
he
saw
before
him
a
future
full
of
bargains
earned
by
the
trained
faculty
of
knowing
better
than
other
people
selling
what
was
about
to
decline
keeping
what
was
still
going
up
and
exercising
judicious
insight
into
future
taste
he
would
make
a
unique
collection
which
at
his
death
would
pass
to
the
nation
under
the
title
bequest
if
the
divorce
went
through
he
had
determined
on
his
line
with
madame
lamotte
she
had
he
knew
but
one
real
live
on
her
in
paris
near
her
grandchildren
he
would
buy
the
goodwill
of
the
restaurant
bretagne
at
a
fancy
price
madame
would
live
like
a
in
paris
on
the
interest
invested
as
she
would
know
how
incidentally
soames
meant
to
put
a
capable
manager
in
her
place
and
make
the
restaurant
pay
good
interest
on
his
money
there
were
great
possibilities
in
soho
on
annette
he
would
promise
to
settle
fifteen
thousand
pounds
whether
designedly
or
not
precisely
the
sum
old
jolyon
had
settled
on
woman
a
letter
from
jolyon
solicitor
to
his
own
had
disclosed
the
fact
that
two
were
in
italy
and
an
opportunity
had
been
duly
given
for
noting
that
they
had
first
stayed
at
an
hotel
in
london
the
matter
was
clear
as
daylight
and
would
be
disposed
of
in
half
an
hour
or
so
but
during
that
he
soames
would
go
down
to
hell
and
after
that
all
bearers
of
the
forsyte
name
would
feel
the
bloom
was
off
the
rose
he
had
no
illusions
like
shakespeare
that
roses
by
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
the
name
was
a
possession
a
concrete
unstained
piece
of
property
the
value
of
which
would
be
reduced
some
twenty
per
cent
at
least
unless
it
were
roger
who
had
once
refused
to
stand
for
parliament
irony
hung
on
the
line
there
had
never
been
a
distinguished
forsyte
but
that
very
lack
of
distinction
was
the
name
greatest
asset
it
was
a
private
name
intensely
individual
and
his
own
property
it
had
never
been
exploited
for
good
or
evil
by
intrusive
report
he
and
each
member
of
his
family
owned
it
wholly
sanely
secretly
without
any
more
interference
from
the
public
than
had
been
necessitated
by
their
births
their
marriages
their
deaths
and
during
these
weeks
of
waiting
and
preparing
to
drop
the
law
he
conceived
for
that
law
a
bitter
distaste
so
deeply
did
he
resent
its
coming
violation
of
his
name
forced
on
him
by
the
need
he
felt
to
perpetuate
that
name
in
a
lawful
manner
the
monstrous
injustice
of
the
whole
thing
excited
in
him
a
perpetual
suppressed
fury
he
had
asked
no
better
than
to
live
in
spotless
domesticity
and
now
he
must
go
into
the
witness
box
after
all
these
futile
barren
years
and
proclaim
his
failure
to
keep
his
the
pity
the
amusement
the
contempt
of
his
kind
it
was
all
upside
down
she
and
that
fellow
ought
to
be
the
sufferers
and
in
italy
in
these
weeks
the
law
he
had
served
so
faithfully
looked
on
so
reverently
as
the
guardian
of
all
property
seemed
to
him
quite
pitiful
what
could
be
more
insane
than
to
tell
a
man
that
he
owned
his
wife
and
punish
him
when
someone
unlawfully
took
her
away
from
him
did
the
law
not
know
that
a
man
name
was
to
him
the
apple
of
his
eye
that
it
was
far
harder
to
be
regarded
as
cuckold
than
as
seducer
he
actually
envied
jolyon
the
reputation
of
succeeding
where
he
soames
had
failed
the
question
of
damages
worried
him
too
he
wanted
to
make
that
fellow
suffer
but
he
remembered
his
cousin
words
i
shall
be
very
happy
with
the
uneasy
feeling
that
to
claim
damages
would
make
not
jolyon
but
himself
suffer
he
felt
uncannily
that
jolyon
would
rather
like
to
pay
chap
was
so
loose
besides
to
claim
damages
was
not
the
thing
to
do
the
claim
indeed
had
been
made
almost
mechanically
and
as
the
hour
drew
near
soames
saw
in
it
just
another
dodge
of
this
insensitive
and
law
to
make
him
ridiculous
so
that
people
might
sneer
and
say
oh
yes
he
got
quite
a
good
price
for
her
and
he
gave
instructions
that
his
counsel
should
state
that
the
money
would
be
given
to
a
home
for
fallen
women
he
was
a
long
time
hitting
off
exactly
the
right
charity
but
having
pitched
on
it
he
used
to
wake
up
in
the
night
and
think
wo
do
too
lurid
draw
attention
something
taste
he
did
not
care
for
dogs
or
he
would
have
named
them
and
it
was
in
desperation
at
his
knowledge
of
charities
was
he
decided
on
the
blind
that
could
not
be
inappropriate
and
it
would
make
the
jury
assess
the
damages
high
a
good
many
suits
were
dropping
out
of
the
list
which
happened
to
be
exceptionally
thin
that
summer
so
that
his
case
would
be
reached
before
august
as
the
day
grew
nearer
winifred
was
his
only
comfort
she
showed
the
of
one
who
had
been
through
the
mill
and
was
the
in
whom
he
confided
well
knowing
that
she
would
not
let
dartie
into
her
confidence
that
ruffian
would
be
only
too
rejoiced
at
the
end
of
july
on
the
afternoon
before
the
case
he
went
in
to
see
her
they
had
not
yet
been
able
to
leave
town
because
dartie
had
already
spent
their
summer
holiday
and
winifred
dared
not
go
to
her
father
for
more
money
while
he
was
waiting
not
to
be
told
anything
about
this
affair
of
soames
soames
found
her
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
that
from
val
he
asked
gloomily
what
does
he
say
he
says
he
married
said
winifred
whom
to
for
goodness
sake
winifred
looked
up
at
him
to
holly
forsyte
jolyon
what
he
got
leave
and
did
it
i
did
even
know
he
knew
her
awkward
it
soames
uttered
a
short
laugh
at
that
characteristic
minimisation
awkward
well
i
do
suppose
they
hear
about
this
till
they
come
back
they
better
stay
out
there
that
fellow
will
give
her
but
i
want
val
back
said
winifred
almost
piteously
i
miss
him
he
helps
me
to
get
i
know
murmured
soames
how
dartie
behaving
now
it
might
be
worse
but
it
always
money
would
you
like
me
to
come
down
to
the
court
soames
soames
stretched
out
his
hand
for
hers
the
gesture
so
betrayed
the
loneliness
in
him
that
she
pressed
it
between
her
two
never
mind
old
boy
you
feel
ever
so
much
better
when
it
all
i
do
know
what
i
done
said
soames
huskily
i
never
have
all
upside
down
i
was
fond
of
her
i
always
winifred
saw
a
drop
of
blood
ooze
out
of
his
lip
and
the
sight
stirred
her
profoundly
of
course
she
said
it
been
too
bad
of
her
all
along
but
what
shall
i
do
about
this
marriage
of
val
soames
i
do
know
how
to
write
to
him
with
this
coming
on
you
seen
that
child
is
she
pretty
yes
she
pretty
said
soames
does
sound
so
bad
thought
winifred
had
style
it
is
a
coil
she
said
what
will
father
say
must
be
told
said
soames
the
war
soon
be
over
now
better
let
val
take
to
farming
out
it
was
tantamount
to
saying
that
his
nephew
was
lost
i
have
told
monty
winifred
murmured
desolately
the
case
was
reached
before
noon
next
day
and
was
over
in
little
more
than
half
an
hour
spruce
in
the
suffered
so
much
beforehand
that
he
took
it
all
like
one
dead
the
moment
the
decree
nisi
was
pronounced
he
left
the
courts
of
justice
four
hours
until
he
became
public
property
divorce
suit
a
surly
dogged
anger
replaced
that
dead
feeling
within
him
them
all
he
thought
wo
run
away
i
act
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
in
the
sweltering
heat
of
fleet
street
and
ludgate
hill
he
walked
all
the
way
to
his
city
club
lunched
and
went
back
to
his
office
he
worked
there
stolidly
throughout
the
afternoon
on
his
way
out
he
saw
that
his
clerks
knew
and
answered
their
involuntary
glances
with
a
look
so
sardonic
that
they
were
immediately
withdrawn
in
front
of
paul
he
stopped
to
buy
the
most
gentlemanly
of
the
evening
papers
yes
there
he
was
solicitor
divorce
cousin
damages
given
to
the
they
had
got
that
in
at
every
other
face
he
thought
wonder
if
you
know
and
suddenly
he
felt
queer
as
if
something
were
racing
round
in
his
head
what
was
this
he
was
letting
it
get
hold
of
him
he
must
he
would
be
ill
he
must
think
he
would
get
down
to
the
river
and
row
about
and
fish
not
going
to
be
laid
up
he
thought
it
flashed
across
him
that
he
had
something
of
importance
to
do
before
he
went
out
of
town
madame
lamotte
he
must
explain
the
law
another
six
months
before
he
was
really
free
only
he
did
not
want
to
see
annette
and
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
top
of
his
was
very
hot
he
branched
off
through
covent
garden
on
this
sultry
day
of
late
july
the
air
of
the
old
market
offended
him
and
soho
seemed
more
than
ever
the
disenchanted
home
of
rapscallionism
alone
the
restaurant
bretagne
neat
daintily
painted
with
its
blue
tubs
and
the
dwarf
trees
therein
retained
an
aloof
and
frenchified
it
was
the
slack
hour
and
pale
trim
waitresses
were
preparing
the
little
tables
for
dinner
soames
went
through
into
the
private
part
to
his
discomfiture
annette
answered
his
knock
she
too
looked
pale
and
dragged
down
by
the
heat
you
are
quite
a
stranger
she
said
languidly
soames
smiled
i
have
wished
to
be
i
been
where
your
mother
annette
i
got
some
news
for
mother
is
not
it
seemed
to
soames
that
she
looked
at
him
in
a
queer
way
what
did
she
know
how
much
had
her
mother
told
her
the
worry
of
trying
to
make
that
out
gave
him
an
alarming
feeling
in
the
head
he
gripped
the
edge
of
the
table
and
dizzily
saw
annette
come
forward
her
eyes
clear
with
surprise
he
shut
his
own
and
said
it
all
right
i
had
a
touch
of
the
sun
i
the
sun
what
he
had
was
a
touch
of
annette
voice
french
and
composed
said
sit
down
it
will
pass
her
hand
pressed
his
shoulder
and
soames
sank
into
a
chair
when
the
dark
feeling
dispersed
and
he
opened
his
eyes
she
was
looking
down
at
him
what
an
inscrutable
and
odd
expression
for
a
girl
of
twenty
do
you
feel
better
it
nothing
said
soames
instinct
told
him
that
to
be
feeble
before
her
was
not
helping
was
enough
handicap
without
that
was
his
fortune
with
annette
he
had
lost
ground
these
latter
months
from
could
not
afford
to
lose
any
more
he
got
up
and
said
i
write
to
your
mother
i
going
down
to
my
river
house
for
a
long
holiday
i
want
you
both
to
come
there
presently
and
stay
it
just
at
its
best
you
will
wo
you
it
will
be
veree
a
pretty
little
roll
of
that
but
no
enthusiasm
and
rather
sadly
he
added
you
feeling
the
heat
too
are
you
annette
it
do
you
good
to
be
on
the
river
annette
swayed
forward
there
was
a
sort
of
compunction
in
the
movement
are
you
fit
to
go
shall
i
give
you
some
coffee
no
said
soames
firmly
give
me
your
she
held
out
her
hand
and
soames
raised
it
to
his
lips
when
he
looked
up
her
face
wore
again
that
strange
expression
ca
tell
he
thought
as
he
went
out
i
must
must
worry
but
worry
he
did
walking
toward
pall
mall
english
not
of
her
religion
scarred
as
it
were
by
domestic
tragedy
what
had
he
to
give
her
only
wealth
social
position
leisure
admiration
it
was
much
but
was
it
enough
for
a
beautiful
girl
of
twenty
he
felt
so
ignorant
about
annette
he
had
too
a
curious
fear
of
the
french
nature
of
her
mother
and
herself
they
knew
so
well
what
they
wanted
they
were
almost
forsytes
they
would
never
grasp
a
shadow
and
miss
a
substance
the
tremendous
effort
it
was
to
write
a
simple
note
to
madame
lamotte
when
he
reached
his
club
warned
him
still
further
that
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
my
dear
madame
he
said
you
will
see
by
the
enclosed
newspaper
cutting
that
i
obtained
my
decree
of
divorce
by
the
english
law
i
shall
not
however
be
free
to
marry
again
till
the
decree
is
confirmed
six
months
hence
in
the
meanwhile
i
have
the
honor
to
ask
to
be
considered
a
formal
suitor
for
the
hand
of
your
daughter
i
shall
write
again
in
a
few
days
and
beg
you
both
to
come
and
stay
at
my
river
house
i
am
dear
madame
sincerely
yours
soames
having
sealed
and
posted
this
letter
he
went
into
the
three
mouthfuls
of
soup
convinced
him
that
he
could
not
eat
and
causing
a
cab
to
be
summoned
he
drove
to
paddington
station
and
took
the
first
train
to
reading
he
reached
his
house
just
as
the
sun
went
down
and
wandered
out
on
to
the
lawn
the
air
was
drenched
with
the
scent
of
pinks
and
picotees
in
his
a
stealing
coolness
came
off
the
river
let
a
poor
fellow
rest
let
not
worry
and
shame
and
anger
chase
like
evil
in
his
head
like
those
doves
perched
on
their
dovecot
like
the
furry
creatures
in
the
woods
on
the
far
side
and
the
simple
folk
in
their
cottages
like
the
trees
and
the
river
itself
whitening
fast
in
twilight
like
the
darkening
sky
where
stars
were
coming

and

chapter
of
an
age
the
marriage
of
soames
with
annette
took
place
in
paris
on
the
last
day
of
january
with
such
privacy
that
not
even
emily
was
told
until
it
was
accomplished
the
day
after
the
wedding
he
brought
her
to
one
of
those
quiet
hotels
in
london
where
greater
expense
can
be
incurred
for
less
result
than
anywhere
else
under
heaven
her
beauty
in
the
best
parisian
frocks
was
giving
him
more
satisfaction
than
if
he
had
collected
a
perfect
bit
of
china
or
a
jewel
of
a
picture
he
looked
forward
to
the
moment
when
he
would
exhibit
her
in
park
lane
in
green
street
and
at
timothy
if
some
one
had
asked
him
in
those
days
in
you
in
love
with
this
girl
he
would
have
replied
in
love
what
is
love
if
you
mean
do
i
feel
to
her
as
i
did
towards
irene
in
those
old
days
when
i
first
met
her
and
she
would
not
have
me
when
i
sighed
and
starved
after
her
and
could
rest
a
minute
until
she
if
you
mean
do
i
admire
her
youth
and
prettiness
do
my
senses
ache
a
little
when
i
see
her
moving
do
i
think
she
will
keep
me
straight
make
me
a
creditable
wife
and
a
good
mother
for
my
children
yes
what
more
do
i
need
and
what
more
do
of
the
women
who
are
married
get
from
the
men
who
marry
them
and
if
the
enquirer
had
pursued
his
query
and
do
you
think
it
was
fair
to
have
tempted
this
girl
to
give
herself
to
you
for
life
unless
you
have
really
touched
her
heart
he
would
have
answered
the
french
see
these
things
differently
from
us
they
look
at
marriage
from
the
point
of
view
of
establishments
and
children
and
from
my
own
experience
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
theirs
is
not
the
sensible
view
i
shall
not
expect
this
time
more
than
i
can
get
or
she
can
give
years
hence
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
have
trouble
with
her
but
i
shall
be
getting
old
i
shall
have
children
by
then
i
shall
shut
my
eyes
i
have
had
my
great
passion
hers
is
perhaps
to
do
suppose
it
will
be
for
me
i
offer
her
a
great
deal
and
i
do
expect
much
in
return
except
children
or
at
least
a
son
but
one
thing
i
am
sure
has
very
good
sense
and
if
insatiate
the
enquirer
had
gone
on
you
do
not
look
then
for
spiritual
union
in
this
marriage
soames
would
have
lifted
his
sideway
smile
and
rejoined
that
as
it
may
be
if
i
get
satisfaction
for
my
senses
perpetuation
of
myself
good
taste
and
good
humour
in
the
house
it
is
all
i
can
expect
at
my
age
i
am
not
likely
to
be
going
out
of
my
way
towards
any
whereon
the
enquirer
must
in
good
taste
have
ceased
enquiry
the
queen
was
dead
and
the
air
of
the
greatest
city
upon
earth
grey
with
unshed
tears
and
with
annette
beside
him
in
dark
furs
soames
crossed
park
lane
on
the
morning
of
the
funeral
procession
to
the
rails
in
hyde
park
little
moved
though
he
ever
was
by
public
matters
this
event
supremely
symbolical
this
of
a
long
rich
period
impressed
his
fancy
in
when
she
came
to
the
throne
dosset
was
still
building
houses
to
make
london
hideous
and
james
a
stripling
of
just
laying
the
foundations
of
his
practice
in
the
law
coaches
still
ran
men
wore
stocks
shaved
their
upper
lips
ate
oysters
out
of
barrels
swung
behind
cabriolets
women
said
and
owned
no
property
there
were
manners
in
the
land
and
pigsties
for
the
poor
unhappy
devils
were
hanged
for
little
crimes
and
dickens
had
but
just
begun
to
write
two
generations
had
slipped
steamboats
railways
telegraphs
bicycles
electric
light
telephones
and
now
these
such
accumulated
wealth
that
eight
per
cent
had
become
three
and
forsytes
were
numbered
by
the
thousand
morals
had
changed
manners
had
changed
men
had
become
monkeys
god
had
become
so
respectable
as
to
deceive
himself
years
that
favoured
property
and
had
made
the
upper
middle
class
buttressed
chiselled
polished
it
till
it
was
almost
indistinguishable
in
manners
morals
speech
appearance
habit
and
soul
from
the
nobility
an
epoch
which
had
gilded
individual
liberty
so
that
if
a
man
had
money
he
was
free
in
law
and
fact
and
if
he
had
not
money
he
was
free
in
law
and
not
in
fact
an
era
which
had
canonised
hypocrisy
so
that
to
seem
to
be
respectable
was
to
be
a
great
age
whose
transmuting
influence
nothing
had
escaped
save
the
nature
of
man
and
the
nature
of
the
universe
and
to
witness
the
passing
of
this
age
pet
and
pouring
forth
her
citizens
through
every
gate
into
hyde
park
hub
of
victorianism
happy
of
forsytes
under
the
grey
heavens
whose
drizzle
just
kept
off
the
dark
concourse
gathered
to
see
the
show
the
old
queen
full
of
years
and
virtue
had
emerged
from
her
seclusion
for
the
last
time
to
make
a
london
holiday
from
houndsditch
acton
ealing
hampstead
islington
and
bethnal
green
from
hackney
hornsey
leytonstone
battersea
and
fulham
and
from
those
green
pastures
where
forsytes
and
kensington
james
and
belgravia
bayswater
and
chelsea
and
the
regent
park
the
people
swarmed
down
on
to
the
roads
where
death
would
presently
pass
with
dusky
pomp
and
pageantry
never
again
would
a
queen
reign
so
long
or
people
have
a
chance
to
see
so
much
history
buried
for
their
money
a
pity
the
war
dragged
on
and
that
the
wreath
of
victory
could
not
be
laid
upon
her
coffin
all
else
would
be
there
to
follow
and
sailors
foreign
princes
bunting
tolling
bells
and
above
all
the
surging
great
crowd
with
perhaps
a
simple
sadness
here
and
there
deep
in
hearts
beneath
black
clothes
put
on
by
regulation
after
all
more
than
a
queen
was
going
to
her
rest
a
woman
who
had
braved
sorrow
lived
well
and
wisely
according
to
her
lights
out
in
the
crowd
against
the
railings
with
his
arm
hooked
in
annette
soames
waited
yes
the
age
was
passing
what
with
this
trade
unionism
and
labour
fellows
in
the
house
of
commons
with
continental
fiction
and
something
in
the
general
feel
of
everything
not
to
be
expressed
in
words
things
were
very
different
he
recalled
the
crowd
on
mafeking
night
and
george
forsyte
saying
they
all
socialists
they
want
our
like
james
soames
did
know
he
could
edward
on
the
throne
things
would
never
be
as
safe
again
as
under
good
old
viccy
convulsively
he
pressed
his
young
wife
arm
there
at
any
rate
was
something
substantially
his
own
domestically
certain
again
at
last
something
which
made
property
worth
real
thing
once
more
pressed
close
against
her
and
trying
to
ward
others
off
soames
was
content
the
crowd
swayed
round
them
ate
sandwiches
and
dropped
crumbs
boys
who
had
climbed
the
chattered
above
like
monkeys
threw
twigs
and
it
was
past
time
they
should
be
coming
soon
and
suddenly
a
little
behind
them
to
the
left
he
saw
a
tallish
man
with
a
soft
hat
and
short
grizzling
beard
and
a
tallish
woman
in
a
little
round
fur
cap
and
veil
jolyon
and
irene
talking
smiling
at
each
other
close
together
like
annette
and
himself
they
had
not
seen
him
and
stealthily
with
a
very
queer
feeling
in
his
heart
soames
watched
those
two
they
looked
happy
what
had
they
come
here
illicit
creatures
rebels
from
the
victorian
ideal
what
business
had
they
in
this
crowd
each
of
them
twice
exiled
by
a
boast
as
it
were
of
love
and
laxity
he
watched
them
fascinated
admitting
grudgingly
even
with
his
arm
thrust
through
he
would
not
admit
it
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
he
would
not
see
them
and
let
the
old
bitterness
the
old
longing
rise
up
within
him
and
then
annette
turned
to
him
and
said
those
two
people
soames
they
know
you
i
am
sure
who
are
they
soames
nosed
sideways
what
people
there
you
see
them
just
turning
away
they
know
no
soames
answered
a
mistake
my
a
lovely
face
and
how
she
walk
elle
est
tres
distinguee
soames
looked
then
into
his
life
out
of
his
life
she
had
walked
like
that
swaying
and
erect
remote
unseizable
ever
eluding
the
contact
of
his
soul
he
turned
abruptly
from
that
receding
vision
of
the
past
you
better
attend
he
said
they
coming
now
but
while
he
stood
grasping
her
arm
seemingly
intent
on
the
head
of
the
procession
he
was
quivering
with
the
sense
of
always
missing
something
with
instinctive
regret
that
he
had
not
got
them
both
slow
came
the
music
and
the
march
till
in
silence
the
long
line
wound
in
through
the
park
gate
he
heard
annette
whisper
how
sad
it
is
and
beautiful
felt
the
clutch
of
her
hand
as
she
stood
up
on
tiptoe
and
the
crowd
emotion
gripped
him
there
it
bier
of
the
queen
coffin
of
the
age
slow
passing
and
as
it
went
by
there
came
a
murmuring
groan
from
all
the
long
line
of
those
who
watched
a
sound
such
as
soames
had
never
heard
so
unconscious
primitive
deep
and
wild
that
neither
he
nor
any
knew
whether
they
had
joined
in
uttering
it
strange
sound
indeed
tribute
of
an
age
to
its
own
death
ah
ah
the
hold
on
life
had
slipped
that
which
had
seemed
eternal
was
gone
the
bless
her
it
moved
on
with
the
bier
that
travelling
groan
as
a
fire
moves
on
over
grass
in
a
thin
line
it
kept
step
and
marched
alongside
down
the
dense
crowds
mile
after
mile
it
was
a
human
sound
and
yet
inhuman
pushed
out
by
animal
subconsciousness
by
intimate
knowledge
of
universal
death
and
change
none
of
of
us
can
hold
on
for
ever
it
left
silence
for
a
very
little
time
till
tongues
began
eager
to
retrieve
interest
in
the
show
soames
lingered
just
long
enough
to
gratify
annette
then
took
her
out
of
the
park
to
lunch
at
his
father
in
park
lane
james
had
spent
the
morning
gazing
out
of
his
bedroom
window
the
last
show
he
would
see
last
of
so
many
so
she
was
gone
well
she
was
getting
an
old
woman
swithin
and
he
had
seen
her
slip
of
a
girl
not
so
old
as
imogen
she
had
got
very
stout
of
late
jolyon
and
he
had
seen
her
married
to
that
german
chap
her
had
turned
out
all
right
before
he
died
and
left
her
with
that
son
of
his
and
he
remembered
the
many
evenings
he
and
his
brothers
and
their
cronies
had
wagged
their
heads
over
their
wine
and
walnuts
and
that
fellow
in
his
salad
days
and
now
he
had
come
to
the
throne
they
said
he
had
steadied
did
tell
he
make
the
money
fly
still
he
should
wonder
what
a
lot
of
people
out
there
it
did
seem
so
very
long
since
he
and
swithin
stood
in
the
crowd
outside
westminster
abbey
when
she
was
crowned
and
swithin
had
taken
him
to
cremorne
chap
swithin
no
it
did
seem
much
longer
ago
than
jubilee
year
when
he
had
joined
with
roger
in
renting
a
balcony
in
piccadilly
jolyon
swithin
roger
all
gone
and
he
would
be
ninety
in
august
and
there
was
soames
married
again
to
a
french
girl
the
french
were
a
queer
lot
but
they
made
good
mothers
he
had
heard
things
changed
they
said
this
german
emperor
was
here
for
the
funeral
his
telegram
to
old
kruger
had
been
in
shocking
taste
he
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
chap
made
trouble
some
day
change
h
well
they
must
look
after
themselves
when
he
was
gone
he
did
know
where
he
be
and
now
emily
had
asked
dartie
to
lunch
with
winifred
and
imogen
to
meet
soames
was
always
doing
something
and
there
was
irene
living
with
that
fellow
jolyon
they
said
he
marry
her
now
he
supposed
brother
jolyon
he
thought
would
he
have
said
to
it
all
and
somehow
the
utter
impossibility
of
knowing
what
his
elder
brother
once
so
looked
up
to
would
have
said
so
worried
james
that
he
got
up
from
his
chair
by
the
window
and
began
slowly
feebly
to
pace
the
room
was
a
pretty
thing
too
he
thought
was
fond
of
her
perhaps
soames
did
suit
do
ca
tell
we
never
had
any
trouble
with
our
wives
women
had
changed
everything
had
changed
and
now
the
queen
was
there
it
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
brought
him
to
a
standstill
at
the
window
his
nose
touching
the
pane
and
whitening
from
the
chill
of
it
they
had
got
her
as
far
as
hyde
park
were
passing
now
why
did
emily
come
up
here
where
she
could
see
instead
of
fussing
about
lunch
he
missed
her
at
that
her
through
the
bare
branches
of
the
he
could
just
see
the
procession
could
see
the
hats
coming
off
the
lot
of
them
would
catch
colds
he
should
wonder
a
voice
behind
him
said
you
got
a
capital
view
here
james
there
you
are
muttered
james
why
did
you
come
before
you
might
have
missed
it
and
he
was
silent
staring
with
all
his
might
what
the
noise
he
asked
suddenly
there
no
noise
returned
emily
what
are
you
thinking
of
would
i
can
hear
nonsense
james
no
sound
came
through
those
double
panes
what
james
heard
was
the
groaning
in
his
own
heart
at
sight
of
his
age
passing
do
you
ever
tell
me
where
i
buried
he
said
suddenly
i
want
to
and
he
turned
from
the
window
there
she
went
the
old
queen
she
had
a
lot
of
be
glad
to
be
out
of
it
he
should
think
emily
took
up
the
there
be
just
time
to
brush
your
head
she
said
before
they
come
you
must
look
your
best
ah
muttered
james
they
say
she
the
meeting
with
his
new
took
place
in
the
james
was
seated
by
the
fire
when
she
was
brought
in
he
placed
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
slowly
raised
himself
stooping
and
immaculate
in
his
thin
as
a
line
in
euclid
he
received
annette
hand
in
his
and
the
anxious
eyes
of
his
furrowed
face
which
had
lost
its
colour
now
doubted
above
her
a
little
warmth
came
into
them
and
into
his
cheeks
refracted
from
her
bloom
how
are
you
he
said
you
been
to
see
the
queen
i
suppose
did
you
have
a
good
crossing
in
this
way
he
greeted
her
from
whom
he
hoped
for
a
grandson
of
his
name
gazing
at
him
so
old
thin
white
and
spotless
annette
murmured
something
in
french
which
james
did
not
understand
yes
yes
he
said
you
want
your
lunch
i
expect
soames
ring
the
bell
we
wo
wait
for
that
chap
but
just
then
they
arrived
dartie
had
refused
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
see
old
girl
with
an
early
cocktail
beside
him
he
had
taken
a
from
the
of
the
iseeum
so
that
winifred
and
imogen
had
been
obliged
to
come
back
from
the
park
to
fetch
him
thence
his
brown
eyes
rested
on
annette
with
a
stare
of
almost
startled
satisfaction
the
second
beauty
that
fellow
soames
had
picked
up
what
women
could
see
in
him
well
she
would
play
him
the
same
trick
as
the
other
no
doubt
but
in
the
meantime
he
was
a
lucky
devil
and
he
brushed
up
his
moustache
having
in
nine
months
of
green
street
domesticity
regained
almost
all
his
flesh
and
his
assurance
despite
the
comfortable
efforts
of
emily
composure
imogen
enquiring
friendliness
dartie
and
james
solicitude
about
her
food
it
was
not
soames
felt
a
successful
lunch
for
his
bride
he
took
her
away
very
soon
that
monsieur
dartie
said
annette
in
the
cab
je
pas
ce
no
by
george
said
soames
your
sister
is
veree
amiable
and
the
girl
is
pretty
your
father
is
veree
old
i
think
your
mother
has
trouble
with
him
i
should
not
like
to
be
soames
nodded
at
the
shrewdness
the
clear
hard
judgment
in
his
young
wife
but
it
disquieted
him
a
little
the
thought
may
have
just
flashed
through
him
too
i
eighty
she
be
having
trouble
with
me
there
just
one
other
house
of
my
relations
i
must
take
you
to
he
said
you
find
it
funny
but
we
must
get
it
over
and
then
dine
and
go
to
the
in
this
way
he
prepared
her
for
timothy
but
timothy
was
different
they
were
delighted
to
see
dear
soames
after
this
long
long
time
and
so
this
was
annette
you
are
so
pretty
my
dear
almost
too
young
and
pretty
for
dear
soames
are
you
but
he
very
attentive
and
a
good
hush
aunt
juley
checked
herself
and
placed
her
lips
just
under
each
of
annette
afterwards
described
them
to
francie
who
dropped
in
as
so
pretty
i
quite
wanted
to
kiss
them
i
must
say
dear
soames
is
a
perfect
connoisseur
in
her
french
way
and
not
so
very
french
either
i
think
she
as
not
so
distinguished
not
so
irene
because
she
was
alluring
was
she
with
that
white
skin
and
those
dark
eyes
and
that
hair
couleur
was
it
i
always
feuille
morte
francie
prompted
of
course
dead
strange
i
remember
when
i
was
a
girl
before
we
came
to
london
we
had
a
foxhound
it
was
called
then
it
had
a
tan
top
to
its
head
and
a
white
chest
and
beautiful
dark
brown
eyes
and
it
was
a
yes
auntie
said
francie
but
i
do
see
the
oh
replied
aunt
juley
rather
flustered
it
was
so
alluring
and
her
eyes
and
hair
you
know
she
was
silent
as
if
surprised
in
some
indelicacy
feuille
morte
she
added
suddenly
remember
that
considerable
debate
took
place
between
the
two
sisters
whether
timothy
should
or
should
not
be
summoned
to
see
annette
oh
do
bother
said
soames
but
it
no
trouble
only
of
course
annette
being
french
might
upset
him
a
little
he
was
so
scared
about
fashoda
i
think
perhaps
we
had
better
not
run
the
risk
hester
it
nice
to
have
her
all
to
ourselves
is
it
and
how
are
you
soames
have
you
quite
got
over
your
hester
interposed
hurriedly
what
do
you
think
of
london
annette
soames
disquieted
awaited
the
reply
it
came
sensible
composed
oh
i
know
london
i
have
visited
he
had
never
ventured
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
of
the
restaurant
the
french
had
different
notions
about
gentility
and
to
shrink
from
connection
with
it
might
seem
to
her
ridiculous
he
had
waited
to
be
married
before
mentioning
it
and
now
he
wished
he
had
and
what
part
do
you
know
best
said
aunt
juley
soho
said
annette
simply
soames
snapped
his
jaw
soho
repeated
aunt
juley
soho
go
round
the
family
thought
soames
it
very
french
and
interesting
he
said
yes
murmured
aunt
juley
your
uncle
roger
had
some
houses
there
once
he
was
always
having
to
turn
the
tenants
out
i
soames
changed
the
subject
to
mapledurham
of
course
said
aunt
juley
you
will
be
going
down
there
soon
to
settle
in
we
are
all
so
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
annette
has
a
dear
little
juley
cried
aunt
hester
desperately
ring
tea
soames
dared
not
wait
for
tea
and
took
annette
away
i
should
mention
soho
if
i
were
you
he
said
in
the
cab
rather
a
shady
part
of
london
and
you
altogether
above
that
restaurant
business
now
i
mean
he
added
i
want
you
to
know
nice
people
and
the
english
are
fearful
annette
clear
eyes
opened
a
little
smile
came
on
her
lips
yes
she
said
thought
soames
meant
for
me
and
he
looked
at
her
hard
got
good
business
instincts
he
thought
must
make
her
grasp
it
once
for
all
look
here
annette
it
very
simple
only
it
wants
understanding
our
professional
and
leisured
classes
still
think
themselves
a
cut
above
our
business
classes
except
of
course
the
very
rich
it
may
be
stupid
but
there
it
is
you
see
it
is
advisable
in
england
to
let
people
know
that
you
ran
a
restaurant
or
kept
a
shop
or
were
in
any
kind
of
trade
it
may
have
been
extremely
creditable
but
it
puts
a
sort
of
label
on
you
you
do
have
such
a
good
time
or
meet
such
nice
i
see
said
annette
it
is
the
same
in
oh
murmured
soames
at
once
relieved
and
taken
aback
of
course
class
is
everything
yes
said
annette
comme
vous
etes
all
right
thought
soames
watching
her
lips
pretty
cynical
his
knowledge
of
french
was
not
yet
such
as
to
make
him
grieve
that
she
had
not
said
he
slipped
his
arm
round
her
and
murmured
with
an
effort
et
vous
etes
ma
belle
annette
went
off
into
a
little
fit
of
laughter
oh
non
she
said
oh
non
ne
parlez
pas
francais
soames
what
is
that
old
lady
your
aunt
looking
forward
to
soames
bit
his
lip
god
knows
he
said
she
always
saying
something
but
he
knew
better
than
god
chapter
animation
the
war
dragged
on
nicholas
had
been
heard
to
say
that
it
would
cost
three
hundred
millions
if
it
cost
a
penny
before
they
done
with
it
the
was
seriously
threatened
still
there
would
be
south
africa
for
their
money
once
for
all
and
though
the
possessive
instinct
felt
badly
shaken
at
three
in
the
morning
it
recovered
by
with
the
recollection
that
one
gets
nothing
in
this
world
without
paying
for
it
so
on
the
whole
people
went
about
their
business
much
as
if
there
were
no
war
no
concentration
camps
no
slippery
de
wet
no
feeling
on
the
continent
no
anything
unpleasant
indeed
the
attitude
of
the
nation
was
typified
by
timothy
map
whose
animation
was
timothy
no
longer
moved
the
flags
and
they
could
not
move
themselves
not
even
backwards
and
forwards
as
they
should
have
done
suspended
animation
went
further
it
invaded
forsyte
and
produced
a
general
uncertainty
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
next
the
announcement
in
the
marriage
column
of
the
times
forsyte
to
irene
only
daughter
of
the
late
professor
heron
had
occasioned
doubt
whether
irene
had
been
justly
described
and
yet
on
the
whole
relief
was
felt
that
she
had
not
been
entered
as
late
the
wife
or
divorced
wife
soames
forsyte
altogether
there
had
been
a
kind
of
sublimity
from
the
first
about
the
way
the
family
had
taken
that
as
james
had
phrased
it
it
was
no
use
to
fuss
nothing
to
be
had
out
of
admitting
that
it
had
been
a
the
phraseology
of
the
day
but
what
would
happen
now
that
both
soames
and
jolyon
were
married
again
that
was
very
intriguing
george
was
known
to
have
laid
eustace
six
to
four
on
a
little
jolyon
before
a
little
soames
george
was
so
droll
it
was
rumoured
too
that
he
and
dartie
had
a
bet
as
to
whether
james
would
attain
the
age
of
ninety
though
which
of
them
had
backed
james
no
one
knew
early
in
may
winifred
came
round
to
say
that
val
had
been
wounded
in
the
leg
by
a
spent
bullet
and
was
to
be
discharged
his
wife
was
nursing
him
he
would
have
a
little
to
speak
of
he
wanted
his
grandfather
to
buy
him
a
farm
out
there
where
he
could
breed
horses
her
father
was
giving
holly
eight
hundred
a
year
so
they
could
be
quite
comfortable
because
his
grandfather
would
give
val
five
he
had
said
but
as
to
the
farm
he
did
tell
he
did
want
val
to
go
throwing
away
his
money
but
you
know
said
winifred
he
must
do
aunt
hester
thought
that
perhaps
his
dear
grandfather
was
wise
because
if
he
did
buy
a
farm
it
could
turn
out
badly
but
val
loves
horses
said
winifred
it
be
such
an
occupation
for
aunt
juley
thought
that
horses
were
very
uncertain
had
not
montague
found
them
so
val
different
said
winifred
he
takes
after
aunt
juley
was
sure
that
dear
val
was
very
clever
i
always
remember
she
added
how
he
gave
his
bad
penny
to
a
beggar
his
dear
grandfather
was
so
pleased
he
thought
it
showed
such
presence
of
mind
i
remember
his
saying
that
he
ought
to
go
into
the
aunt
hester
chimed
in
did
not
winifred
think
that
it
was
much
better
for
the
young
people
to
be
secure
and
not
run
any
risk
at
their
age
well
said
winifred
if
they
were
in
london
perhaps
in
london
amusing
to
do
nothing
but
out
there
of
course
he
simply
get
bored
to
aunt
hester
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
for
him
to
work
if
he
were
quite
sure
not
to
lose
by
it
it
was
not
as
if
they
had
no
money
timothy
of
course
had
done
so
well
by
retiring
aunt
juley
wanted
to
know
what
montague
had
said
winifred
did
not
tell
her
for
montague
had
merely
remarked
wait
till
the
old
man
at
this
moment
francie
was
announced
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
a
smile
well
she
said
what
do
you
think
of
it
of
what
dear
in
the
times
this
we
have
seen
it
we
always
read
it
after
dinner
timothy
has
it
till
francie
rolled
her
eyes
do
you
think
you
ought
to
tell
us
said
aunt
juley
what
was
it
irene
had
a
son
at
robin
aunt
juley
drew
in
her
breath
but
she
said
they
were
only
married
in
march
yes
auntie
is
it
interesting
well
said
winifred
i
glad
i
was
sorry
for
jolyon
losing
his
boy
it
might
have
been
aunt
juley
seemed
to
go
into
a
sort
of
dream
i
wonder
she
murmured
what
dear
soames
will
think
he
has
so
wanted
to
have
a
son
himself
a
little
bird
has
always
told
me
well
said
winifred
he
going
gladness
trickled
out
of
aunt
juley
eyes
how
delightful
she
said
when
such
a
lucky
month
but
she
did
wish
it
could
be
sooner
it
was
a
long
time
for
james
to
wait
at
his
age
to
wait
they
dreaded
it
for
james
but
they
were
used
to
it
themselves
indeed
it
was
their
great
distraction
to
wait
for
the
times
to
read
for
one
or
other
of
their
nieces
or
nephews
to
come
in
and
cheer
them
up
for
news
of
nicholas
health
for
that
decision
of
about
going
on
the
stage
for
information
concerning
the
mine
of
macander
nephew
for
the
doctor
to
come
about
hester
inclination
to
wake
up
early
in
the
morning
for
books
from
the
library
which
were
always
out
for
timothy
to
have
a
cold
for
a
nice
quiet
warm
day
not
too
hot
when
they
could
take
a
turn
in
kensington
gardens
to
wait
one
on
each
side
of
the
hearth
in
the
for
the
clock
between
them
to
strike
their
thin
veined
knuckled
hands
plying
and
their
hair
ordered
to
canute
any
further
advance
in
colour
to
wait
in
their
black
silks
or
satins
for
the
court
to
say
that
hester
might
wear
her
dark
green
and
juley
her
darker
maroon
to
wait
slowly
turning
over
and
over
in
their
old
minds
the
little
joys
and
sorrows
events
and
expectancies
of
their
little
family
world
as
cows
chew
patient
cuds
in
a
familiar
field
and
this
new
event
was
so
well
worth
waiting
for
soames
had
always
been
their
pet
with
his
tendency
to
give
them
pictures
and
his
almost
weekly
visits
which
they
missed
so
much
and
his
need
for
their
sympathy
evoked
by
the
wreck
of
his
first
marriage
this
new
birth
of
an
heir
to
so
important
for
him
and
for
his
dear
father
too
that
james
might
not
have
to
die
without
some
certainty
about
things
james
did
so
dislike
uncertainty
and
with
montague
of
course
he
could
not
feel
really
satisfied
to
leave
no
but
the
young
darties
after
all
one
own
name
did
count
and
as
james
ninetieth
birthday
neared
they
wondered
what
precautions
he
was
taking
he
would
be
the
first
of
the
forsytes
to
reach
that
age
and
set
as
it
were
a
new
standard
in
holding
on
to
life
that
was
so
important
they
felt
at
their
ages
and
though
they
did
not
want
to
think
of
themselves
when
they
had
timothy
who
was
not
yet
to
think
of
there
was
of
course
a
better
world
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
was
one
of
aunt
juley
favourite
always
comforted
her
with
its
suggestion
of
house
property
which
had
made
the
fortune
of
dear
roger
the
bible
was
indeed
a
great
resource
and
on
very
fine
sundays
there
was
church
in
the
morning
and
sometimes
juley
would
steal
into
timothy
study
when
she
was
sure
he
was
out
and
just
put
an
open
new
testament
casually
among
the
books
on
his
little
was
a
great
reader
of
course
having
been
a
publisher
but
she
had
noticed
that
timothy
was
always
cross
at
dinner
afterwards
and
smither
had
told
her
more
than
once
that
she
had
picked
books
off
the
floor
in
doing
the
room
still
with
all
that
they
did
feel
that
heaven
could
not
be
quite
so
cosy
as
the
rooms
in
which
they
and
timothy
had
been
waiting
so
long
aunt
hester
especially
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
the
exertion
any
change
or
rather
the
thought
of
a
there
never
was
upset
her
very
much
aunt
juley
who
had
more
spirit
sometimes
thought
it
would
be
quite
exciting
she
had
so
enjoyed
that
visit
to
brighton
the
year
dear
susan
died
but
then
brighton
one
knew
was
nice
and
it
was
so
difficult
to
tell
what
heaven
would
be
like
so
on
the
whole
she
was
more
than
content
to
wait
on
the
morning
of
james
birthday
august
the
they
felt
extraordinary
animation
and
little
notes
passed
between
them
by
the
hand
of
smither
while
they
were
having
breakfast
in
their
beds
smither
must
go
round
and
take
their
love
and
little
presents
and
find
out
how
james
was
and
whether
he
had
passed
a
good
night
with
all
the
excitement
and
on
the
way
back
would
smither
call
in
at
green
was
a
little
out
of
her
way
but
she
could
take
the
bus
up
bond
street
afterwards
it
would
be
a
nice
little
change
for
ask
dear
dartie
to
be
sure
and
look
in
before
she
went
out
of
town
all
this
smither
undeniable
servant
trained
many
years
ago
under
aunt
ann
to
a
perfection
not
now
procurable
james
so
james
said
had
passed
an
excellent
night
he
sent
his
love
james
had
said
he
was
very
funny
and
had
complained
that
he
did
know
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
oh
and
dartie
sent
her
love
and
she
would
come
to
tea
aunts
juley
and
hester
rather
hurt
that
their
presents
had
not
received
special
forgot
every
year
that
james
could
not
bear
to
receive
presents
away
their
money
on
him
as
he
always
called
it
showed
that
james
was
in
good
spirits
and
that
was
so
important
for
him
and
they
began
to
wait
for
winifred
she
came
at
four
bringing
imogen
and
maud
just
back
from
school
and
such
a
pretty
girl
too
so
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
ask
for
news
about
annette
aunt
juley
however
summoned
courage
to
enquire
whether
winifred
had
heard
anything
and
if
soames
was
anxious
uncle
soames
is
always
anxious
auntie
interrupted
imogen
he
be
happy
now
he
got
the
words
struck
familiarly
on
aunt
juley
ears
ah
yes
that
funny
drawing
of
george
which
had
not
been
shown
them
but
what
did
imogen
mean
that
her
uncle
always
wanted
more
than
he
could
have
it
was
not
at
all
nice
to
think
like
that
imogen
voice
rose
clear
and
clipped
imagine
annette
only
two
years
older
than
me
it
must
be
awful
for
her
married
to
uncle
aunt
juley
lifted
her
hands
in
horror
my
dear
she
said
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
your
uncle
soames
is
a
match
for
anybody
he
a
very
clever
man
and
and
wealthy
and
most
considerate
and
careful
and
not
at
all
old
considering
imogen
turning
her
luscious
glance
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
dears
only
smiled
i
hope
said
aunt
juley
quite
severely
that
you
will
marry
as
good
a
i
sha
marry
a
good
man
auntie
murmured
imogen
they
if
you
go
on
like
this
replied
aunt
juley
still
very
much
upset
you
wo
marry
anybody
we
better
not
pursue
the
subject
and
turning
to
winifred
she
said
how
is
montague
that
evening
while
they
were
waiting
for
dinner
she
murmured
i
told
smither
to
get
up
half
a
bottle
of
the
sweet
champagne
hester
i
think
we
ought
to
drink
dear
james
health
the
health
of
soames
wife
only
let
keep
that
quite
secret
i
just
say
like
this
you
know
hester
and
then
we
drink
it
might
upset
it
more
likely
to
upset
us
said
aunt
nester
but
we
must
i
suppose
for
such
an
yes
said
aunt
juley
rapturously
it
is
an
occasion
only
fancy
if
he
has
a
dear
little
boy
to
carry
the
family
on
i
do
feel
it
so
important
now
that
irene
has
had
a
son
winifred
says
george
is
calling
jolyon
because
of
his
three
families
you
know
george
is
droll
and
fancy
irene
is
living
after
all
in
the
house
soames
had
built
for
them
both
it
does
seem
hard
on
dear
soames
and
he
always
been
so
that
night
in
bed
excited
and
a
little
flushed
still
by
her
glass
of
wine
and
the
secrecy
of
the
second
toast
she
lay
with
her
opened
flat
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
ceiling
yellowed
by
the
light
from
her
young
things
it
was
so
nice
for
them
all
and
she
would
be
so
happy
if
she
could
see
dear
soames
happy
but
of
course
he
must
be
now
in
spite
of
what
imogen
had
said
he
would
have
all
that
he
wanted
property
and
wife
and
children
and
he
would
live
to
a
green
old
age
like
his
dear
father
and
forget
all
about
irene
and
that
dreadful
case
if
only
she
herself
could
be
here
to
buy
his
children
their
first
smither
should
choose
it
for
her
at
the
stores
nice
and
dappled
ah
how
roger
used
to
rock
her
until
she
fell
off
oh
dear
that
was
a
long
time
ago
it
was
my
father
house
are
many
little
scrattling
noise
caught
her
no
mice
she
thought
mechanically
the
noise
increased
there
it
was
a
mouse
how
naughty
of
smither
to
say
there
was
it
would
be
eating
through
the
wainscot
before
they
knew
where
they
were
and
they
would
have
to
have
the
builders
in
they
were
such
destructive
things
and
she
lay
with
her
eyes
just
moving
following
in
her
mind
that
little
scrattling
sound
and
waiting
for
sleep
to
release
her
from
it
chapter
of
a
forsyte
soames
walked
out
of
the
garden
door
crossed
the
lawn
stood
on
the
path
above
the
river
turned
round
and
walked
back
to
the
garden
door
without
having
realised
that
he
had
moved
the
sound
of
wheels
crunching
the
drive
convinced
him
that
time
had
passed
and
the
doctor
gone
what
exactly
had
he
said
this
is
the
position
forsyte
i
can
make
pretty
certain
of
her
life
if
i
operate
but
the
baby
will
be
born
dead
if
i
do
operate
the
baby
will
most
probably
be
born
alive
but
it
a
great
risk
for
the
great
risk
in
either
case
i
do
think
she
can
ever
have
another
child
in
her
state
she
obviously
ca
decide
for
herself
and
we
ca
wait
for
her
mother
it
for
you
to
make
the
decision
while
i
getting
what
necessary
i
shall
be
back
within
the
the
decision
what
a
decision
no
time
to
get
a
specialist
down
no
time
for
anything
the
sound
of
wheels
died
away
but
soames
still
stood
intent
then
suddenly
covering
his
ears
he
walked
back
to
the
river
to
come
before
its
time
like
this
with
no
chance
to
foresee
anything
not
even
to
get
her
mother
here
it
was
for
her
mother
to
make
that
decision
and
she
could
arrive
from
paris
till
if
only
he
could
have
understood
the
doctor
jargon
the
medical
niceties
so
as
to
be
sure
he
was
weighing
the
chances
properly
but
they
were
greek
to
a
legal
problem
to
a
layman
and
yet
he
must
decide
he
brought
his
hand
away
from
his
brow
wet
though
the
air
was
chilly
these
sounds
which
came
from
her
room
to
go
back
there
would
only
make
it
more
difficult
he
must
be
calm
clear
on
the
one
hand
life
nearly
certain
of
his
young
wife
death
quite
certain
of
his
child
more
children
afterwards
on
the
other
death
perhaps
of
his
wife
nearly
certain
life
for
the
child
more
children
afterwards
which
to
choose
it
had
rained
this
last
river
was
very
full
and
in
the
water
collected
round
the
little
moored
by
his
were
many
leaves
from
the
woods
above
brought
off
by
a
frost
leaves
fell
lives
drifted
to
decide
about
death
and
no
one
to
give
him
a
hand
life
lost
was
lost
for
good
let
nothing
go
that
you
could
keep
for
if
it
went
you
could
get
it
back
it
left
you
bare
like
those
trees
when
they
lost
their
leaves
barer
and
barer
until
you
too
withered
and
came
down
and
by
a
queer
somersault
of
thought
he
seemed
to
see
not
annette
lying
up
there
behind
that
on
which
the
sun
was
shining
but
irene
lying
in
their
bedroom
in
montpellier
square
as
it
might
conceivably
have
been
her
fate
to
lie
sixteen
years
ago
would
he
have
hesitated
then
not
a
moment
operate
operate
make
certain
of
her
life
no
mere
instinctive
cry
for
help
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
even
then
that
she
did
not
love
him
but
this
ah
there
was
nothing
overmastering
in
his
feeling
for
annette
many
times
these
last
months
especially
since
she
had
been
growing
frightened
he
had
wondered
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
was
selfish
in
her
french
way
and
pretty
what
would
she
take
the
risk
know
she
wants
the
child
he
thought
it
born
dead
and
no
more
chance
upset
her
terribly
no
more
chance
all
for
nothing
married
life
with
her
for
years
and
years
without
a
child
nothing
to
steady
her
she
too
young
nothing
to
look
forward
to
for
me
for
me
he
struck
his
hands
against
his
chest
why
could
he
think
without
bringing
himself
out
of
himself
and
see
what
he
ought
to
do
the
thought
hurt
him
then
lost
edge
as
if
it
had
come
in
contact
with
a
breastplate
out
of
oneself
impossible
out
into
soundless
scentless
touchless
sightless
space
the
very
idea
was
ghastly
futile
and
touching
there
the
bedrock
of
reality
the
bottom
of
his
forsyte
spirit
soames
rested
for
a
moment
when
one
ceased
all
ceased
it
might
go
on
but
there
be
nothing
in
it
he
looked
at
his
watch
in
half
an
hour
the
doctor
would
be
back
he
must
decide
if
against
the
operation
and
she
died
how
face
her
mother
and
the
doctor
afterwards
how
face
his
own
conscience
it
was
his
child
that
she
was
having
if
for
the
he
condemned
them
both
to
childlessness
and
for
what
else
had
he
married
her
but
to
have
a
lawful
heir
and
his
death
door
waiting
for
the
news
cruel
he
thought
ought
never
to
have
such
a
thing
to
settle
cruel
he
turned
towards
the
house
some
deep
simple
way
of
deciding
he
took
out
a
coin
and
put
it
back
if
he
spun
it
he
knew
he
would
not
abide
by
what
came
up
he
went
into
the
furthest
away
from
that
room
whence
the
sounds
issued
the
doctor
had
said
there
was
a
chance
in
here
that
chance
seemed
greater
the
river
did
not
flow
nor
the
leaves
fall
a
fire
was
burning
soames
unlocked
the
tantalus
he
hardly
ever
touched
spirits
but
poured
himself
out
some
whisky
and
drank
it
neat
craving
a
faster
flow
of
blood
fellow
jolyon
he
thought
had
children
already
he
has
the
woman
i
really
loved
and
now
a
son
by
her
and
asked
to
destroy
my
only
child
annette
ca
die
it
not
possible
she
strong
he
was
still
standing
sullenly
at
the
sideboard
when
he
heard
the
doctor
carriage
and
went
out
to
him
he
had
to
wait
for
him
to
come
downstairs
well
doctor
the
situation
the
same
have
you
decided
yes
said
soames
do
operate
not
you
risk
great
in
soames
set
face
nothing
moved
but
the
lips
you
said
there
was
a
chance
a
chance
yes
not
much
of
you
say
the
baby
must
be
born
dead
if
you
do
do
you
still
think
that
in
any
case
she
ca
have
another
one
ca
be
absolutely
sure
but
it
most
she
strong
said
soames
we
take
the
the
doctor
looked
at
him
very
gravely
it
on
your
shoulders
he
said
with
my
own
wife
i
soames
chin
jerked
up
as
if
someone
had
hit
him
am
i
of
any
use
up
there
he
asked
no
keep
i
shall
be
in
my
then
you
know
the
doctor
nodded
and
went
upstairs
soames
continued
to
stand
listening
this
time
he
thought
may
have
her
death
on
my
hands
no
it
was
to
put
it
that
way
sullenness
dropped
on
him
again
and
he
went
up
to
the
gallery
he
stood
at
the
window
the
wind
was
in
the
north
it
was
cold
clear
very
blue
sky
heavy
ragged
white
clouds
chasing
across
the
river
blue
too
through
the
screen
of
goldening
trees
the
woods
all
rich
with
colour
glowing
early
autumn
if
it
were
his
own
life
would
he
be
taking
that
risk
she
take
the
risk
of
losing
me
he
thought
than
lose
her
child
she
does
really
love
me
what
could
one
girl
and
french
the
one
thing
really
vital
to
them
both
vital
to
their
marriage
and
their
futures
was
a
child
been
through
a
lot
for
this
he
thought
hold
on
there
a
chance
of
keeping
chance
one
kept
till
things
were
naturally
kept
he
began
walking
round
the
gallery
he
had
made
one
purchase
lately
which
he
knew
was
a
fortune
in
itself
and
he
halted
before
girl
with
dull
gold
hair
which
looked
like
filaments
of
metal
gazing
at
a
little
golden
monster
she
was
holding
in
her
hand
even
at
this
tortured
moment
he
could
just
feel
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
bargain
he
had
the
quality
of
the
table
the
floor
the
chair
the
figure
the
absorbed
expression
on
her
face
the
dull
gold
filaments
of
her
hair
the
bright
gold
of
the
little
monster
collecting
pictures
growing
richer
richer
what
use
if
he
turned
his
back
abruptly
on
the
picture
and
went
to
the
window
some
of
his
doves
had
flown
up
from
their
perches
round
the
dovecot
and
were
stretching
their
wings
in
the
wind
in
the
clear
sharp
sunlight
their
whiteness
almost
flashed
they
flew
far
making
a
hieroglyphic
against
the
sky
annette
fed
the
doves
it
was
pretty
to
see
her
they
took
it
out
of
her
hand
they
knew
she
was
a
choking
sensation
came
into
his
throat
she
would
not
die
she
was
sensible
and
she
was
strong
really
strong
like
her
mother
in
spite
of
her
fair
prettiness
it
was
already
growing
dark
when
at
last
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
listening
not
a
sound
a
milky
twilight
crept
about
the
stairway
and
the
landings
below
he
had
turned
back
when
a
sound
caught
his
ear
peering
down
he
saw
a
black
shape
moving
and
his
heart
stood
still
what
was
it
death
the
shape
of
death
coming
from
her
door
no
only
a
maid
without
cap
or
apron
she
came
to
the
foot
of
his
flight
of
stairs
and
said
breathlessly
the
doctor
wants
to
see
you
he
ran
down
she
stood
flat
against
the
wall
to
let
him
pass
and
said
oh
sir
it
over
said
soames
with
a
sort
of
menace
what
mean
it
born
he
dashed
up
the
four
steps
in
front
of
him
and
came
suddenly
on
the
doctor
in
the
dim
passage
the
man
was
wiping
his
brow
well
he
said
quick
both
living
it
all
right
i
soames
stood
quite
still
covering
his
eyes
i
congratulate
you
he
heard
the
doctor
say
it
was
touch
and
soames
let
fall
the
hand
which
was
covering
his
face
thanks
he
said
thanks
very
much
what
is
it
a
son
would
have
killed
a
daughter
the
utmost
care
of
both
he
hears
the
doctor
say
and
we
shall
do
when
does
the
mother
come
between
nine
and
ten
i
i
stay
till
then
do
you
want
to
see
them
not
now
said
soames
before
you
go
i
have
dinner
sent
up
to
and
he
went
downstairs
relief
unspeakable
and
daughter
it
seemed
to
him
unfair
to
have
taken
that
have
been
through
this
what
agony
a
daughter
he
stood
before
the
blazing
fire
of
wood
logs
in
the
hall
touching
it
with
his
toe
and
trying
to
readjust
himself
father
he
thought
a
bitter
disappointment
no
disguising
it
one
never
got
all
one
wanted
in
this
life
and
there
was
no
least
if
there
was
it
was
no
use
while
he
was
standing
there
a
telegram
was
brought
him
come
up
at
once
your
father
sinking
he
read
it
with
a
choking
sensation
one
would
have
thought
he
feel
anything
after
these
last
hours
but
he
felt
this
seven
a
train
from
reading
at
nine
and
madame
train
if
she
had
caught
it
came
in
at
would
meet
that
and
go
on
he
ordered
the
carriage
ate
some
dinner
mechanically
and
went
upstairs
the
doctor
came
out
to
him
they
i
wo
go
in
said
soames
with
relief
my
father
dying
i
have
up
is
it
all
right
the
doctor
face
expressed
a
kind
of
doubting
admiration
they
were
all
as
unemotional
he
might
have
been
saying
yes
i
think
you
may
go
with
an
easy
mind
you
be
down
soon
said
soames
here
the
the
doctor
seemed
to
hover
on
the
verge
of
sympathy
said
soames
abruptly
and
turned
away
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
death
it
was
a
chilly
business
he
smoked
a
cigarette
in
the
of
his
rare
cigarettes
the
night
was
windy
and
flew
on
black
wings
the
carriage
lights
had
to
search
out
the
way
his
father
that
old
old
man
a
comfortless
die
the
london
train
came
in
just
as
he
reached
the
station
and
madame
lamotte
substantial
very
yellow
in
the
lamplight
came
towards
the
exit
with
a
this
all
you
have
asked
soames
but
yes
i
had
not
the
time
how
is
my
little
one
doing
a
girl
a
girl
what
joy
i
had
a
frightful
crossing
her
black
bulk
solid
unreduced
by
the
frightful
crossing
climbed
into
the
brougham
and
you
mon
cher
my
father
dying
said
soames
between
his
teeth
i
going
up
give
my
love
to
tiens
murmured
madame
lamotte
quel
malheur
soames
took
his
hat
off
and
moved
towards
his
train
french
he
thought
chapter
is
told
a
simple
cold
caught
in
the
room
with
double
windows
where
the
air
and
the
people
who
saw
him
were
filtered
as
it
were
the
room
he
had
not
left
since
the
middle
of
james
was
in
deep
waters
a
little
cold
passing
his
little
strength
and
flying
quickly
to
his
lungs
he
must
catch
cold
the
doctor
had
declared
and
he
had
gone
and
caught
it
when
he
first
felt
it
in
his
throat
he
had
said
to
his
he
had
one
there
i
knew
how
it
would
be
airing
the
room
like
that
for
a
whole
day
he
was
highly
nervous
about
himself
and
went
in
advance
of
all
precautions
and
remedies
drawing
every
breath
with
extreme
care
and
having
his
temperature
taken
every
hour
emily
was
not
alarmed
but
next
morning
when
she
went
in
the
nurse
whispered
he
wo
have
his
temperature
emily
crossed
to
the
side
of
the
bed
where
he
was
lying
and
said
softly
how
do
you
feel
james
holding
the
thermometer
to
his
lips
james
looked
up
at
her
what
the
good
of
that
he
murmured
huskily
i
do
want
to
then
she
was
alarmed
he
breathed
with
difficulty
he
looked
terribly
frail
white
with
faint
red
discolorations
she
had
trouble
with
him
goodness
knew
but
he
was
james
had
been
james
for
nearly
fifty
years
she
could
remember
or
imagine
life
without
behind
all
his
fussiness
his
pessimism
his
crusty
shell
deeply
affectionate
really
kind
and
generous
to
them
all
all
that
day
and
the
next
he
hardly
uttered
a
word
but
there
was
in
his
eyes
a
noticing
of
everything
done
for
him
a
look
on
his
face
which
told
her
he
was
fighting
and
she
did
not
lose
hope
his
very
stillness
the
way
he
conserved
every
little
scrap
of
energy
showed
the
tenacity
with
which
he
was
fighting
it
touched
her
deeply
and
though
her
face
was
composed
and
comfortable
in
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
when
she
was
out
of
it
about
on
the
third
had
just
changed
her
dress
keeping
her
appearance
so
as
not
to
alarm
him
because
he
noticed
saw
a
difference
no
use
i
tired
was
written
plainly
across
that
white
face
and
when
she
went
up
to
him
he
muttered
send
for
yes
james
she
said
comfortably
all
and
she
kissed
his
forehead
a
tear
dropped
there
and
as
she
wiped
it
off
she
saw
that
his
eyes
looked
grateful
much
upset
and
without
hope
now
she
sent
soames
the
telegram
when
he
entered
out
of
the
black
windy
night
the
big
house
was
still
as
a
grave
warmson
broad
face
looked
almost
narrow
he
took
the
fur
coat
with
a
sort
of
added
care
saying
will
you
have
a
glass
of
wine
sir
soames
shook
his
head
and
his
eyebrows
made
enquiry
warmson
lips
twitched
he
asking
for
you
sir
and
suddenly
he
blew
his
nose
it
a
long
time
sir
he
said
that
i
been
with
long
soames
left
him
folding
the
coat
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
this
house
where
he
had
been
born
and
sheltered
had
never
seemed
to
him
so
warm
and
rich
and
cosy
as
during
this
last
pilgrimage
to
his
room
it
was
not
his
taste
but
in
its
own
substantial
lincrusta
way
it
was
the
acme
of
comfort
and
security
and
the
night
was
so
dark
and
windy
the
grave
so
cold
and
lonely
he
paused
outside
the
door
no
sound
came
from
within
he
turned
the
handle
softly
and
was
in
the
room
before
he
was
perceived
the
light
was
shaded
his
mother
and
winifred
were
sitting
on
the
far
side
of
the
bed
the
nurse
was
moving
away
from
the
near
side
where
was
an
empty
chair
me
thought
soames
as
he
moved
from
the
door
his
mother
and
sister
rose
but
he
signed
with
his
hand
and
they
sat
down
again
he
went
up
to
the
chair
and
stood
looking
at
his
father
james
breathing
was
as
if
strangled
his
eyes
were
closed
and
in
soames
looking
on
his
father
so
worn
and
white
and
wasted
listening
to
his
strangled
breathing
there
rose
a
passionate
vehemence
of
anger
against
nature
cruel
inexorable
nature
kneeling
on
the
chest
of
that
wisp
of
a
body
slowly
pressing
out
the
breath
pressing
out
the
life
of
the
being
who
was
dearest
to
him
in
the
world
his
father
of
all
men
had
lived
a
careful
life
moderate
abstemious
and
this
was
his
have
life
slowly
painfully
squeezed
out
of
him
and
without
knowing
that
he
spoke
he
said
it
cruel
he
saw
his
mother
cover
her
eyes
and
winifred
bow
her
face
towards
the
bed
women
they
put
up
with
things
so
much
better
than
men
he
took
a
step
nearer
to
his
father
for
three
days
james
had
not
been
shaved
and
his
lips
and
chin
were
covered
with
hair
hardly
more
snowy
than
his
forehead
it
softened
his
face
gave
it
a
queer
look
already
not
of
this
world
his
eyes
opened
soames
went
quite
close
and
bent
over
the
lips
moved
here
i
am
father
news
they
never
tell
the
voice
died
and
a
flood
of
emotion
made
soames
face
work
so
that
he
could
not
speak
tell
him
but
what
he
made
a
great
effort
got
his
lips
together
and
said
good
news
dear
a
ah
it
was
the
queerest
sound
ugly
relieved
pitiful
the
noise
a
baby
makes
getting
what
it
wants
the
eyes
closed
and
that
strangled
sound
of
breathing
began
again
soames
recoiled
to
the
chair
and
stonily
sat
down
the
lie
he
had
told
based
as
it
were
on
some
deep
temperamental
instinct
that
after
death
james
would
not
know
the
truth
had
taken
away
all
power
of
feeling
for
the
moment
his
arm
brushed
against
something
it
was
his
father
naked
foot
in
the
struggle
to
breathe
he
had
pushed
it
out
from
under
the
clothes
soames
took
it
in
his
hand
a
cold
foot
light
and
thin
white
very
cold
what
use
to
put
it
back
to
wrap
up
that
which
must
be
colder
soon
he
warmed
it
mechanically
with
his
hand
listening
to
his
laboured
breathing
while
the
power
of
feeling
rose
again
within
him
a
little
sob
quickly
smothered
came
from
winifred
but
his
mother
sat
unmoving
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
james
soames
signed
to
the
nurse
where
the
doctor
he
whispered
he
been
sent
ca
you
do
anything
to
ease
his
breathing
only
an
injection
and
he
ca
stand
it
the
doctor
said
while
he
was
fighting
he
not
fighting
whispered
soames
he
being
slowly
smothered
it
james
stirred
uneasily
as
if
he
knew
what
they
were
saying
soames
rose
and
bent
over
him
james
feebly
moved
his
two
hands
and
soames
took
them
he
wants
to
be
pulled
up
whispered
the
nurse
soames
pulled
he
thought
he
pulled
gently
but
a
look
almost
of
anger
passed
over
james
face
the
nurse
plumped
the
pillows
soames
laid
the
hands
down
and
bending
over
kissed
his
father
forehead
as
he
was
raising
himself
again
james
eyes
bent
on
him
a
look
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
depths
of
what
was
left
within
done
my
boy
it
seemed
to
say
care
of
them
take
care
of
yourself
take
leave
it
all
to
you
yes
yes
soames
whispered
yes
behind
him
the
nurse
did
he
knew
not
what
for
his
father
made
a
tiny
movement
of
repulsion
as
if
resenting
that
interference
and
almost
at
once
his
breathing
eased
away
became
quiet
he
lay
very
still
the
strained
expression
on
his
face
passed
a
curious
white
tranquillity
took
its
place
his
eyelids
quivered
rested
the
whole
face
rested
at
ease
only
by
the
faint
puffing
of
his
lips
could
they
tell
that
he
was
breathing
soames
sank
back
on
his
chair
and
fell
to
cherishing
the
foot
again
he
heard
the
nurse
quietly
crying
over
there
by
the
fire
curious
that
she
a
stranger
should
be
the
only
one
of
them
who
cried
he
heard
the
quiet
lick
and
flutter
of
the
fire
flames
one
more
old
forsyte
going
to
his
long
they
were
how
he
had
held
on
his
mother
and
winifred
were
leaning
forward
hanging
on
the
sight
of
james
lips
but
soames
bent
sideways
over
the
feet
warming
them
both
they
gave
him
comfort
colder
and
colder
though
they
grew
suddenly
he
started
up
a
sound
a
dreadful
sound
such
as
he
had
never
heard
was
coming
from
his
father
lips
as
if
an
outraged
heart
had
broken
with
a
long
moan
what
a
strong
heart
to
have
uttered
that
farewell
it
ceased
soames
looked
into
the
face
no
motion
no
breath
dead
he
kissed
the
brow
turned
round
and
went
out
of
the
room
he
ran
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
his
old
bedroom
still
kept
for
him
flung
himself
face
down
on
the
bed
and
broke
into
sobs
which
he
stilled
with
the
pillow
a
little
later
he
went
downstairs
and
passed
into
the
room
james
lay
alone
wonderfully
calm
free
from
shadow
and
anxiety
with
the
gravity
on
his
ravaged
face
which
underlies
great
age
the
worn
fine
gravity
of
old
coins
soames
looked
steadily
at
that
face
at
the
fire
at
all
the
room
with
windows
thrown
open
to
the
london
night
he
whispered
and
went
out
chapter
he
had
much
to
see
to
that
night
and
all
next
day
a
telegram
at
breakfast
reassured
him
about
annette
and
he
only
caught
the
last
train
back
to
reading
with
emily
kiss
on
his
forehead
and
in
his
ears
her
words
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
you
my
dear
he
reached
his
house
at
midnight
the
weather
had
changed
was
mild
again
as
though
having
finished
its
work
and
sent
a
forsyte
to
his
last
account
it
could
relax
a
second
telegram
received
at
had
confirmed
the
good
news
of
annette
and
instead
of
going
in
soames
passed
down
through
the
garden
in
the
moonlight
to
his
houseboat
he
could
sleep
there
quite
well
bitterly
tired
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
his
fur
coat
and
fell
asleep
he
woke
soon
after
dawn
and
went
on
deck
he
stood
against
the
rail
looking
west
where
the
river
swept
round
in
a
wide
curve
under
the
woods
in
soames
appreciation
of
natural
beauty
was
curiously
like
that
of
his
farmer
ancestors
a
sense
of
grievance
if
it
was
there
sharpened
no
doubt
and
civilised
by
his
researches
among
landscape
painting
but
dawn
has
power
to
fertilise
the
most
vision
and
he
was
stirred
it
was
another
world
from
the
river
he
knew
under
that
remote
cool
light
a
world
into
which
man
had
not
entered
an
unreal
world
like
some
strange
shore
sighted
by
discovery
its
colour
was
not
the
colour
of
convention
was
hardly
colour
at
all
its
shapes
were
brooding
yet
distinct
its
silence
stunning
it
had
no
scent
why
it
should
move
him
he
could
not
tell
unless
it
were
that
he
felt
so
alone
in
it
bare
of
all
relationship
and
all
possessions
into
such
a
world
his
father
might
be
voyaging
for
all
resemblance
it
had
to
the
world
he
had
left
and
soames
took
refuge
from
it
in
wondering
what
painter
could
have
done
it
justice
the
water
was
the
belly
of
a
fish
was
it
possible
that
this
world
on
which
he
looked
was
all
private
property
except
the
even
that
was
tapped
no
tree
no
shrub
not
a
blade
of
grass
not
a
bird
or
beast
not
even
a
fish
that
was
not
owned
and
once
on
a
time
all
this
was
jungle
and
marsh
and
water
and
weird
creatures
roamed
and
sported
without
human
cognizance
to
give
them
names
rotting
luxuriance
had
rioted
where
those
tall
carefully
planted
woods
came
down
to
the
water
and
reeds
on
that
far
side
had
covered
all
the
pasture
well
they
had
got
it
under
kennelled
it
all
up
labelled
it
and
stowed
it
in
lawyers
offices
and
a
good
thing
too
but
once
in
a
way
as
now
the
ghost
of
the
past
came
out
to
haunt
and
brood
and
whisper
to
any
human
who
chanced
to
be
awake
of
my
unowned
loneliness
you
all
came
into
it
some
day
you
will
all
return
and
soames
who
felt
the
chill
and
the
eeriness
of
that
to
him
and
so
very
old
the
world
unowned
visiting
the
scene
of
its
down
and
made
himself
tea
on
a
when
he
had
drunk
it
he
took
out
writing
materials
and
wrote
two
paragraphs
on
the
instant
at
his
residence
in
park

in
an

he
went
across
to
the
house

across
the

round
and
out
of
a
milky
haze
the
went
up
blue
and
straight
and
his
doves
cooed
preening
their
feathers
in
the
sunlight
he
stole
up
to
his
bathed
shaved
put
on
fresh
linen
and
dark
clothes
madame
lamotte
was
beginning
her
breakfast
when
he
went
down
she
looked
at
his
clothes
said
do
tell
me
and
pressed
his
hand
annette
is
prettee
well
but
the
doctor
say
she
can
never
have
no
more
children
you
knew
that
soames
nodded
it
a

mais
la

soames
got
away
from
her
as
soon
as
he
could
she
offended
quick
he
could
not
bear
her
vowels
her
he
resented
the
way
she
had
looked
at
him
as
if
it
were
his
fault
that
annette
could
never
bear
him
a
son
his
fault
he
even
resented
her
cheap
adoration
of
the
daughter
he
had
not
yet
seen
curious
how
he
jibbed
away
from
sight
of
his
wife
and
child
one
would
have
thought
he
must
have
rushed
up
at
the
first
moment
on
the
contrary
he
had
a
sort
of
physical
shrinking
from
possessor
that
he
was
he
was
afraid
of
what
annette
was
thinking
of
him
author
of
her
agonies
afraid
of
the
look
of
the
baby
afraid
of
showing
his
disappointment
with
the
present
future
he
spent
an
hour
walking
up
and
down
the
before
he
could
screw
his
courage
up
to
mount
the
stairs
and
knock
on
the
door
of
their
room
madame
lamotte
opened
it
ah
at
last
you
come
elle
vous
attend
she
passed
him
and
soames
went
in
with
his
noiseless
step
his
jaw
firmly
set
his
eyes
furtive
annette
was
very
pale
and
very
pretty
lying
there
the
baby
was
hidden
away
somewhere
he
could
not
see
it
he
went
up
to
the
bed
and
with
sudden
emotion
bent
and
kissed
her
forehead
here
you
are
then
soames
she
said
i
am
not
so
bad
now
but
i
suffered
terribly
terribly
i
am
glad
i
can
not
have
any
more
oh
how
i
suffered
soames
stood
silent
stroking
her
hand
words
of
endearment
of
sympathy
absolutely
would
not
come
the
thought
passed
through
him
english
girl
would
have
said
that
at
this
moment
he
knew
with
certainty
that
he
would
never
be
near
to
her
in
spirit
and
in
truth
nor
she
to
him
he
had
collected
was
all
and
jolyon
words
came
rushing
into
his
mind
i
should
imagine
you
will
be
glad
to
have
your
neck
out
of
well
he
had
got
it
out
had
he
got
it
in
again
we
must
feed
you
up
he
said
you
soon
be
do
you
want
to
see
baby
soames
she
is
of
course
said
soames
very
he
passed
round
the
foot
of
the
bed
to
the
other
side
and
stood
staring
for
the
first
moment
what
he
saw
was
much
what
he
had
expected
to
baby
but
as
he
stared
and
the
baby
breathed
and
made
little
sleeping
movements
with
its
tiny
features
it
seemed
to
assume
an
individual
shape
grew
to
be
like
a
picture
a
thing
he
would
know
again
not
repulsive
strangely
and
touching
it
had
dark
hair
he
touched
it
with
his
finger
he
wanted
to
see
its
eyes
they
opened
they
were
blue
or
brown
he
could
not
tell
the
eyes
winked
stared
they
had
a
sort
of
sleepy
depth
in
them
and
suddenly
his
heart
felt
queer
warm
as
if
elated
ma

call

awakening
to
charles
scribner
awakening
through
the
massive
skylight
illuminating
the
hall
at
robin
hill
the
july
sunlight
at
five
fell
just
where
the
broad
stairway
turned
and
in
that
radiant
streak
little
jon
forsyte
stood
his
hair
was
shining
and
his
eyes
from
beneath
a
frown
for
he
was
considering
how
to
go
downstairs
this
last
of
innumerable
times
before
the
car
brought
his
father
and
mother
home
four
at
a
time
and
five
at
the
bottom
stale
down
the
banisters
but
in
which
fashion
on
his
face
feet
foremost
very
stale
on
his
stomach
sideways
paltry
on
his
back
with
his
arms
stretched
down
on
both
sides
forbidden
or
on
his
face
head
foremost
in
a
manner
unknown
as
yet
to
any
but
himself
such
was
the
cause
of
the
frown
on
the
illuminated
face
of
little
jon
in
that
summer
of
the
simple
souls
who
even
then
desired
to
simplify
the
english
tongue
had
of
course
no
cognizance
of
little
jon
or
they
would
have
claimed
him
for
a
disciple
but
one
can
be
too
simple
in
this
life
for
his
real
name
was
jolyon
and
his
living
father
and
dead
had
usurped
of
old
the
other
shortenings
jo
and
jolly
as
a
fact
little
jon
had
done
his
best
to
conform
to
convention
and
spell
himself
first
jhon
then
john
not
till
his
father
had
explained
the
sheer
necessity
had
he
spelled
his
name
jon
up
till
now
that
father
had
possessed
what
was
left
of
his
heart
by
the
groom
bob
who
played
the
concertina
and
his
nurse
da
who
wore
the
violet
dress
on
sundays
and
enjoyed
the
name
of
spraggins
in
that
private
life
lived
at
odd
moments
even
by
domestic
servants
his
mother
had
only
appeared
to
him
as
it
were
in
dreams
smelling
delicious
smoothing
his
forehead
just
before
he
fell
asleep
and
sometimes
docking
his
hair
of
a
golden
brown
colour
when
he
cut
his
head
open
against
the
nursery
fender
she
was
there
to
be
bled
over
and
when
he
had
nightmare
she
would
sit
on
his
bed
and
cuddle
his
head
against
her
neck
she
was
precious
but
remote
because
da
was
so
near
and
there
is
hardly
room
for
more
than
one
woman
at
a
time
in
a
man
heart
with
his
father
too
of
course
he
had
special
bonds
of
union
for
little
jon
also
meant
to
be
a
painter
when
he
grew
the
one
small
difference
that
his
father
painted
pictures
and
little
jon
intended
to
paint
ceilings
and
walls
standing
on
a
board
between
two
in
a
apron
and
a
lovely
smell
of
whitewash
his
father
also
took
him
riding
in
richmond
park
on
his
pony
mouse
because
it
was
little
jon
had
been
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
a
mouth
which
was
rather
curly
and
large
he
had
never
heard
his
father
or
his
mother
speak
in
an
angry
voice
either
to
each
other
himself
or
anybody
else
the
groom
bob
cook
jane
bella
and
the
other
servants
even
da
who
alone
restrained
him
in
his
courses
had
special
voices
when
they
talked
to
him
he
was
therefore
of
opinion
that
the
world
was
a
place
of
perfect
and
perpetual
gentility
and
freedom
a
child
of
he
had
come
to
consciousness
when
his
country
just
over
that
bad
attack
of
scarlet
fever
the
boer
war
was
preparing
for
the
liberal
revival
of
coercion
was
unpopular
parents
had
exalted
notions
of
giving
their
offspring
a
good
time
they
spoiled
their
rods
spared
their
children
and
anticipated
the
results
with
enthusiasm
in
choosing
moreover
for
his
father
an
amiable
man
of
who
had
already
lost
an
only
son
and
for
his
mother
a
woman
of
whose
first
and
only
child
he
was
little
jon
had
done
well
and
wisely
what
had
saved
him
from
becoming
a
cross
between
a
lap
dog
and
a
little
prig
had
been
his
father
adoration
of
his
mother
for
even
little
jon
could
see
that
she
was
not
merely
just
his
mother
and
that
he
played
second
fiddle
to
her
in
his
father
heart
what
he
played
in
his
mother
heart
he
knew
not
yet
as
for
auntie
june
his
but
so
old
that
she
had
grown
out
of
the
relationship
she
loved
him
of
course
but
was
too
sudden
his
devoted
da
too
had
a
spartan
touch
his
bath
was
cold
and
his
knees
were
bare
he
was
not
encouraged
to
be
sorry
for
himself
as
to
the
vexed
question
of
his
education
little
jon
shared
the
theory
of
those
who
considered
that
children
should
not
be
forced
he
rather
liked
the
mademoiselle
who
came
for
two
hours
every
morning
to
teach
him
her
language
together
with
history
geography
and
sums
nor
were
the
piano
lessons
which
his
mother
gave
him
disagreeable
for
she
had
a
way
of
luring
him
from
tune
to
tune
never
making
him
practise
one
which
did
not
give
him
pleasure
so
that
he
remained
eager
to
convert
ten
thumbs
into
eight
fingers
under
his
father
he
learned
to
draw
and
other
animals
he
was
not
a
highly
educated
little
boy
yet
on
the
whole
the
silver
spoon
stayed
in
his
mouth
without
spoiling
it
though
da
sometimes
said
that
other
children
would
do
him
a
world
of
it
was
a
disillusionment
then
when
at
the
age
of
nearly
seven
she
held
him
down
on
his
back
because
he
wanted
to
do
something
of
which
she
did
not
approve
this
first
interference
with
the
free
individualism
of
a
forsyte
drove
him
almost
frantic
there
was
something
appalling
in
the
utter
helplessness
of
that
position
and
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
it
would
ever
come
to
an
end
suppose
she
never
let
him
get
up
any
more
he
suffered
torture
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
fifty
seconds
worse
than
anything
was
his
perception
that
da
had
taken
all
that
time
to
realise
the
agony
of
fear
he
was
enduring
thus
dreadfully
was
revealed
to
him
the
lack
of
imagination
in
the
human
being
when
he
was
let
up
he
remained
convinced
that
da
had
done
a
dreadful
thing
though
he
did
not
wish
to
bear
witness
against
her
he
had
been
compelled
by
fear
of
repetition
to
seek
his
mother
and
say
mum
do
let
hold
me
down
on
my
back
his
mother
her
hands
held
up
over
her
head
and
in
them
two
plaits
of
couleur
de
feuille
morte
as
little
jon
had
not
yet
learned
to
call
looked
at
him
with
eyes
like
little
bits
of
his
brown
velvet
tunic
and
answered
no
darling
i
she
being
in
the
nature
of
a
goddess
little
jon
was
satisfied
especially
when
from
under
the
at
breakfast
where
he
happened
to
be
waiting
for
a
mushroom
he
had
overheard
her
say
to
his
father
then
will
you
tell
dear
or
shall
i
she
so
devoted
to
him
and
his
father
answer
well
she
must
show
it
that
way
i
know
exactly
what
it
feels
like
to
be
held
down
on
one
back
no
forsyte
can
stand
it
for
a
conscious
that
they
did
not
know
him
to
be
under
the
table
little
jon
was
visited
by
the
quite
new
feeling
of
embarrassment
and
stayed
where
he
was
ravaged
by
desire
for
the
mushroom
such
had
been
his
first
dip
into
the
dark
abysses
of
existence
nothing
much
had
been
revealed
to
him
after
that
till
one
day
having
gone
down
to
the
for
his
drink
of
milk
fresh
from
the
cow
after
garratt
had
finished
milking
he
had
seen
clover
calf
dead
inconsolable
and
followed
by
an
upset
garratt
he
had
sought
da
but
suddenly
aware
that
she
was
not
the
person
he
wanted
had
rushed
away
to
find
his
father
and
had
run
into
the
arms
of
his
mother
clover
calf
dead
oh
oh
it
looked
so
soft
his
mother
clasp
and
her
yes
darling
there
there
had
stayed
his
sobbing
but
if
calf
could
die
anything
only
bees
flies
beetles
and
look
soft
like
that
this
was
soon
forgotten
the
next
thing
had
been
to
sit
on
a
bumble
bee
a
poignant
experience
which
his
mother
had
understood
much
better
than
da
and
nothing
of
vital
importance
had
happened
after
that
till
the
year
turned
when
following
a
day
of
utter
wretchedness
he
had
enjoyed
a
disease
composed
of
little
spots
bed
honey
in
a
spoon
and
many
tangerine
oranges
it
was
then
that
the
world
had
flowered
to
auntie
june
he
owed
that
flowering
for
no
sooner
was
he
a
little
lame
duck
than
she
came
rushing
down
from
london
bringing
with
her
the
books
which
had
nurtured
her
own
berserker
spirit
born
in
the
noted
year
of
aged
and
of
many
colours
they
were
stored
with
the
most
formidable
happenings
of
these
she
read
to
little
jon
till
he
was
allowed
to
read
to
himself
whereupon
she
whisked
back
to
london
and
left
them
with
him
in
a
heap
those
books
cooked
his
fancy
till
he
thought
and
dreamed
of
nothing
but
midshipmen
and
dhows
pirates
rafts
traders
iron
horses
sharks
battles
tartars
red
indians
balloons
north
poles
and
other
extravagant
delights
the
moment
he
was
suffered
to
get
up
he
rigged
his
bed
fore
and
aft
and
set
out
from
it
in
a
narrow
bath
across
green
seas
of
carpet
to
a
rock
which
he
climbed
by
means
of
its
mahogany
drawer
knobs
to
sweep
the
horizon
with
his
drinking
tumbler
screwed
to
his
eye
in
search
of
rescuing
sails
he
made
a
daily
raft
out
of
the
towel
stand
the
tea
tray
and
his
pillows
he
saved
the
juice
from
his
french
plums
bottled
it
in
an
empty
medicine
bottle
and
provisioned
the
raft
with
the
rum
that
it
became
also
with
pemmican
made
out
of
little
bits
of
chicken
sat
on
and
dried
at
the
fire
and
with
lime
juice
against
scurvy
extracted
from
the
peel
of
his
oranges
and
a
little
economised
juice
he
made
a
north
pole
one
morning
from
the
whole
of
his
bedclothes
except
the
bolster
and
reached
it
in
a
canoe
in
private
life
the
fender
after
a
terrible
encounter
with
a
polar
bear
fashioned
from
the
bolster
and
four
skittles
dressed
up
in
da
nightgown
after
that
his
father
seeking
to
steady
his
imagination
brought
him
ivanhoe
bevis
a
book
about
king
arthur
and
tom
brown
schooldays
he
read
the
first
and
for
three
days
built
defended
and
stormed
front
de
boeuf
castle
taking
every
part
in
the
piece
except
those
of
rebecca
and
rowena
with
piercing
cries
of
en
avant
de
bracy
and
similar
utterances
after
reading
the
book
about
king
arthur
he
became
almost
exclusively
sir
lamorac
de
galis
because
though
there
was
very
little
about
him
he
preferred
his
name
to
that
of
any
other
knight
and
he
rode
his
old
to
death
armed
with
a
long
bamboo
bevis
he
found
tame
besides
it
required
woods
and
animals
of
which
he
had
none
in
his
nursery
except
his
two
cats
fitz
and
puck
forsyte
who
permitted
no
liberties
for
tom
brown
he
was
as
yet
too
young
there
was
relief
in
the
house
when
after
the
fourth
week
he
was
permitted
to
go
down
and
out
the
month
being
march
the
trees
were
exceptionally
like
the
masts
of
ships
and
for
little
jon
that
was
a
wonderful
spring
extremely
hard
on
his
knees
suits
and
the
patience
of
da
who
had
the
washing
and
reparation
of
his
clothes
every
morning
the
moment
his
breakfast
was
over
he
could
be
viewed
by
his
mother
and
father
whose
windows
looked
out
that
way
coming
from
the
study
crossing
the
terrace
climbing
the
old
oak
tree
his
face
resolute
and
his
hair
bright
he
began
the
day
thus
because
there
was
not
time
to
go
far
afield
before
his
lessons
the
old
tree
variety
never
staled
it
had
mainmast
foremast
mast
and
he
could
always
come
down
by
the
ropes
of
the
swing
after
his
lessons
completed
by
eleven
he
would
go
to
the
kitchen
for
a
thin
piece
of
cheese
a
biscuit
and
two
french
enough
for
a
at
eat
it
in
some
imaginative
way
then
armed
to
the
teeth
with
gun
pistols
and
sword
he
would
begin
the
serious
climbing
of
the
morning
encountering
by
the
way
innumerable
slavers
indians
pirates
leopards
and
bears
he
was
seldom
seen
at
that
hour
of
the
day
without
a
cutlass
in
his
teeth
like
dick
needham
amid
the
rapid
explosion
of
copper
caps
and
many
were
the
gardeners
he
brought
down
with
yellow
peas
shot
out
of
his
little
gun
he
lived
a
life
of
the
most
violent
action
jon
said
his
father
to
his
mother
under
the
oak
tree
is
terrible
i
afraid
he
going
to
turn
out
a
sailor
or
something
hopeless
do
you
see
any
sign
of
his
appreciating
beauty
not
the
well
thank
heaven
he
no
turn
for
wheels
or
engines
i
can
bear
anything
but
that
but
i
wish
he
take
more
interest
in
he
imaginative
yes
in
a
sanguinary
way
does
he
love
anyone
just
now
no
only
everyone
there
never
was
anyone
born
more
loving
or
more
lovable
than
being
your
boy
at
this
moment
little
jon
lying
along
a
branch
high
above
them
brought
them
down
with
two
peas
but
that
fragment
of
talk
lodged
thick
in
his
small
gizzard
loving
lovable
imaginative
sanguinary
the
leaves
also
were
thick
by
now
and
it
was
time
for
his
birthday
which
occurring
every
year
on
the
twelfth
of
may
was
always
memorable
for
his
chosen
dinner
of
sweetbread
mushrooms
macaroons
and
ginger
beer
between
that
eighth
birthday
however
and
the
afternoon
when
he
stood
in
the
july
radiance
at
the
turning
of
the
stairway
several
important
things
had
happened
da
worn
out
by
washing
his
knees
or
moved
by
that
mysterious
instinct
which
forces
even
nurses
to
desert
their
nurslings
left
the
very
day
after
his
birthday
in
floods
of
tears
to
be
married
all
to
a
little
jon
from
whom
it
had
been
kept
was
inconsolable
for
an
afternoon
it
ought
not
to
have
been
kept
from
him
two
large
boxes
of
soldiers
and
some
artillery
together
with
the
young
buglers
which
had
been
among
his
birthday
presents
cooperated
with
his
grief
in
a
sort
of
conversion
and
instead
of
seeking
adventures
in
person
and
risking
his
own
life
he
began
to
play
imaginative
games
in
which
he
risked
the
lives
of
countless
tin
soldiers
marbles
stones
and
beans
of
these
forms
of
chair
a
canon
he
made
collections
and
using
them
alternately
fought
the
peninsular
the
seven
years
the
thirty
years
and
other
wars
about
which
he
had
been
reading
of
late
in
a
big
history
of
europe
which
had
been
his
grandfather
he
altered
them
to
suit
his
genius
and
fought
them
all
over
the
floor
in
his
day
nursery
so
that
nobody
could
come
in
for
fearing
of
disturbing
gustavus
adolphus
king
of
sweden
or
treading
on
an
army
of
austrians
because
of
the
sound
of
the
word
he
was
passionately
addicted
to
the
austrians
and
finding
there
were
so
few
battles
in
which
they
were
successful
he
had
to
invent
them
in
his
games
his
favourite
generals
were
prince
eugene
the
archduke
charles
and
wallenstein
tilly
and
mack
turns
he
heard
his
father
call
them
one
day
whatever
that
might
mean
one
really
could
not
love
very
much
austrian
though
they
were
for
euphonic
reasons
too
he
doted
on
turenne
this
phase
which
caused
his
parents
anxiety
because
it
kept
him
indoors
when
he
ought
to
have
been
out
lasted
through
may
and
half
of
june
till
his
father
killed
it
by
bringing
home
to
him
tom
sawyer
and
huckleberry
finn
when
he
read
those
books
something
happened
in
him
and
he
went
out
of
doors
again
in
passionate
quest
of
a
river
there
being
none
on
the
premises
at
robin
hill
he
had
to
make
one
out
of
the
pond
which
fortunately
had
water
lilies
dragonflies
gnats
bullrushes
and
three
small
willow
trees
on
this
pond
after
his
father
and
garratt
had
ascertained
by
sounding
that
it
had
a
reliable
bottom
and
was
nowhere
more
than
two
feet
deep
he
was
allowed
a
little
collapsible
canoe
in
which
he
spent
hours
and
hours
paddling
and
lying
down
out
of
sight
of
indian
joe
and
other
enemies
on
the
shore
of
the
pond
too
he
built
himself
a
wigwam
about
four
feet
square
of
old
biscuit
tins
roofed
in
by
boughs
in
this
he
would
make
little
fires
and
cook
the
birds
he
had
not
shot
with
his
gun
hunting
in
the
coppice
and
fields
or
the
fish
he
did
not
catch
in
the
pond
because
there
were
none
this
occupied
the
rest
of
june
and
that
july
when
his
father
and
mother
were
away
in
ireland
he
led
a
lonely
life
of
make
believe
during
those
five
weeks
of
summer
weather
with
gun
wigwam
water
and
canoe
and
however
hard
his
active
little
brain
tried
to
keep
the
sense
of
beauty
away
she
did
creep
in
on
him
for
a
second
now
and
then
perching
on
the
wing
of
a
glistening
on
the
water
lilies
or
brushing
his
eyes
with
her
blue
as
he
lay
on
his
back
in
ambush
auntie
june
who
had
been
left
in
charge
had
a
in
the
house
with
a
cough
and
a
large
piece
of
putty
which
he
was
making
into
a
face
so
she
hardly
ever
came
down
to
see
him
in
the
pond
once
however
she
brought
with
her
two
other
little
jon
who
happened
to
have
painted
his
naked
self
bright
blue
and
yellow
in
stripes
out
of
his
father
box
and
put
some
feathers
in
his
hair
saw
them
coming
himself
among
the
willows
as
he
had
foreseen
they
came
at
once
to
his
wigwam
and
knelt
down
to
look
inside
so
that
with
a
yell
he
was
able
to
take
the
scalps
of
auntie
june
and
the
woman
in
an
almost
complete
manner
before
they
kissed
him
the
names
of
the
two
were
auntie
holly
and
uncle
val
who
had
a
brown
face
and
a
little
limp
and
laughed
at
him
terribly
he
took
a
fancy
to
auntie
holly
who
seemed
to
be
a
sister
too
but
they
both
went
away
the
same
afternoon
and
he
did
not
see
them
again
three
days
before
his
father
and
mother
were
to
come
home
auntie
june
also
went
off
in
a
great
hurry
taking
the
who
coughed
and
his
piece
of
putty
and
mademoiselle
said
poor
man
he
was
veree
ill
i
forbid
you
to
go
into
his
room
little
jon
who
rarely
did
things
merely
because
he
was
told
not
to
refrained
from
going
though
he
was
bored
and
lonely
in
truth
the
day
of
the
pond
was
past
and
he
was
filled
to
the
brim
of
his
soul
with
restlessness
and
the
want
of
a
tree
not
a
soft
those
last
two
days
had
seemed
months
in
spite
of
cast
up
by
the
sea
wherein
he
was
reading
about
mother
lee
and
her
terrible
wrecking
bonfire
he
had
gone
up
and
down
the
stairs
perhaps
a
hundred
times
in
those
two
days
and
often
from
the
day
nursery
where
he
slept
now
had
stolen
into
his
mother
room
looked
at
everything
without
touching
and
on
into
the
and
standing
on
one
leg
beside
the
bath
like
slingsby
had
whispered
ho
ho
ho
dog
my
cats
mysteriously
to
bring
luck
then
stealing
back
he
had
opened
his
mother
wardrobe
and
taken
a
long
sniff
which
seemed
to
bring
him
nearer
did
know
what
he
had
done
this
just
before
he
stood
in
the
streak
of
sunlight
debating
in
which
of
the
several
ways
he
should
slide
down
the
banisters
they
all
seemed
silly
and
in
a
sudden
languor
he
began
descending
the
steps
one
by
one
during
that
descent
he
could
remember
his
father
quite
short
grey
beard
the
deep
eyes
twinkling
the
furrow
between
them
the
funny
smile
the
thin
figure
which
always
seemed
so
tall
to
little
jon
but
his
mother
he
see
all
that
represented
her
was
something
swaying
with
two
dark
eyes
looking
back
at
him
and
the
scent
of
her
wardrobe
bella
was
in
the
hall
drawing
aside
the
big
curtains
and
opening
the
front
door
little
jon
said
wheedling
bella
yes
master
do
let
have
tea
under
the
oak
tree
when
they
come
i
know
they
like
it
you
mean
you
like
it
little
jon
considered
no
they
would
to
please
bella
smiled
very
well
i
take
it
out
if
you
stay
quiet
here
and
not
get
into
mischief
before
they
little
jon
sat
down
on
the
bottom
step
and
nodded
bella
came
close
and
looked
him
over
get
up
she
said
little
jon
got
up
she
scrutinized
him
behind
he
was
not
green
and
his
knees
seemed
clean
all
right
she
said
my
are
you
brown
give
me
a
kiss
and
little
jon
received
a
peck
on
his
hair
what
jam
he
asked
i
so
tired
of
gooseberry
and
num
they
were
his
favourites
when
she
was
gone
he
sat
still
for
quite
a
minute
it
was
quiet
in
the
big
hall
open
to
its
east
end
so
that
he
could
see
one
of
his
trees
a
brig
sailing
very
slowly
across
the
upper
lawn
in
the
outer
hall
shadows
were
slanting
from
the
pillars
little
jon
got
up
jumped
one
of
them
and
walked
round
the
clump
of
iris
plants
which
filled
the
pool
of
marble
in
the
centre
the
flowers
were
pretty
but
only
smelled
a
very
little
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
and
looked
out
suppose
they
did
come
he
had
waited
so
long
that
he
felt
he
could
not
bear
that
and
his
attention
slid
at
once
from
such
finality
to
the
dust
motes
in
the
bluish
sunlight
coming
in
thrusting
his
hand
up
he
tried
to
catch
some
bella
ought
to
have
dusted
that
piece
of
air
but
perhaps
they
were
what
sunlight
was
made
of
and
he
looked
to
see
whether
the
sunlight
out
of
doors
was
the
same
it
was
not
he
had
said
he
would
stay
quiet
in
the
hall
but
he
simply
any
more
and
crossing
the
gravel
of
the
drive
he
lay
down
on
the
grass
beyond
pulling
six
daisies
he
named
them
carefully
sir
lamorac
sir
tristram
sir
lancelot
sir
palimedes
sir
bors
sir
gawain
and
fought
them
in
couples
till
only
sir
lamorac
whom
he
had
selected
for
a
specially
stout
stalk
had
his
head
on
and
even
he
after
three
encounters
looked
worn
and
waggly
a
beetle
was
moving
slowly
in
the
grass
which
almost
wanted
cutting
every
blade
was
a
small
tree
round
whose
trunk
the
beetle
had
to
glide
little
jon
stretched
out
sir
lamorac
feet
foremost
and
stirred
the
creature
up
it
scuttled
painfully
little
jon
laughed
lost
interest
and
sighed
his
heart
felt
empty
he
turned
over
and
lay
on
his
back
there
was
a
scent
of
honey
from
the
lime
trees
in
flower
and
in
the
sky
the
blue
was
beautiful
with
a
few
white
clouds
which
looked
and
perhaps
tasted
like
lemon
ice
he
could
hear
bob
playing
way
down
upon
de
suwannee
ribber
on
his
concertina
and
it
made
him
nice
and
sad
he
turned
over
again
and
put
his
ear
to
the
could
hear
things
coming
ever
so
he
could
hear
the
concertina
and
almost
instantly
he
did
hear
a
grinding
sound
a
faint
toot
yes
it
was
a
up
he
jumped
should
he
wait
in
the
porch
or
rush
upstairs
and
as
they
came
in
shout
look
and
slide
slowly
down
the
banisters
head
foremost
should
he
the
car
turned
in
at
the
drive
it
was
too
late
and
he
only
waited
jumping
up
and
down
in
his
excitement
the
car
came
quickly
whirred
and
stopped
his
father
got
out
exactly
like
life
he
bent
down
and
little
jon
bobbed
bumped
his
father
said
bless
us
well
old
man
you
are
brown
just
as
he
would
and
the
sense
of
something
unextinguished
in
little
jon
then
with
a
long
shy
look
he
saw
his
mother
in
a
blue
dress
with
a
blue
motor
scarf
over
her
cap
and
hair
smiling
he
jumped
as
high
as
ever
he
could
twined
his
legs
behind
her
back
and
hugged
he
heard
her
gasp
and
felt
her
hugging
back
his
eyes
very
dark
blue
just
then
looked
into
hers
very
dark
brown
till
her
lips
closed
on
his
eyebrow
and
squeezing
with
all
his
might
he
heard
her
creak
and
laugh
and
say
you
are
strong
jon
he
slid
down
at
that
and
rushed
into
the
hall
dragging
her
by
the
hand
while
he
was
eating
his
jam
beneath
the
oak
tree
he
noticed
things
about
his
mother
that
he
had
never
seemed
to
see
before
her
cheeks
for
instance
were
creamy
there
were
silver
threads
in
her
dark
goldy
hair
her
throat
had
no
knob
in
it
like
bella
and
she
went
in
and
out
softly
he
noticed
too
some
little
lines
running
away
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
a
nice
darkness
under
them
she
was
ever
so
beautiful
more
beautiful
than
da
or
mademoiselle
or
auntie
june
or
even
auntie
holly
to
whom
he
had
taken
a
fancy
even
more
beautiful
than
bella
who
had
pink
cheeks
and
came
out
too
suddenly
in
places
this
new
beautifulness
of
his
mother
had
a
kind
of
particular
importance
and
he
ate
less
than
he
had
expected
to
when
tea
was
over
his
father
wanted
him
to
walk
round
the
gardens
he
had
a
long
conversation
with
his
father
about
things
in
general
avoiding
his
private
lamorac
the
austrians
and
the
emptiness
he
had
felt
these
last
three
days
now
so
suddenly
filled
up
his
father
told
him
of
a
place
called
glensofantrim
where
he
and
his
mother
had
been
and
of
the
little
people
who
came
out
of
the
ground
there
when
it
was
very
quiet
little
jon
came
to
a
halt
with
his
heels
apart
do
you
really
believe
they
do
daddy
no
jon
but
i
thought
you
why
you
younger
than
i
and
they
little
jon
squared
the
dimple
in
his
chin
i
do
believe
in
fairies
i
never
see
ha
said
his
father
does
mum
his
father
smiled
his
funny
smile
no
she
only
sees
what
pan
the
goaty
god
who
skips
about
in
wild
and
beautiful
was
he
in
glensofantrim
mum
said
little
jon
took
his
heels
up
and
led
on
did
you
see
him
no
i
only
saw
venus
little
jon
reflected
venus
was
in
his
book
about
the
greeks
and
trojans
then
anna
was
her
christian
and
dyomene
her
surname
but
it
appeared
on
inquiry
that
it
was
one
word
which
meant
rising
from
the
foam
did
she
rise
from
the
foam
in
glensofantrim
yes
every
what
is
she
like
daddy
like
oh
then
she
must
be
but
he
stopped
at
that
rushed
at
a
wall
scrambled
up
and
promptly
scrambled
down
again
the
discovery
that
his
mother
was
beautiful
was
one
which
he
felt
must
absolutely
be
kept
to
himself
his
father
cigar
however
took
so
long
to
smoke
that
at
last
he
was
compelled
to
say
i
want
to
see
what
mum
brought
home
do
you
mind
daddy
he
pitched
the
motive
low
to
absolve
him
from
unmanliness
and
was
a
little
disconcerted
when
his
father
looked
at
him
right
through
heaved
an
important
sigh
and
answered
all
right
old
man
you
go
and
love
he
went
with
a
pretence
of
slowness
and
then
rushed
to
make
up
he
entered
her
bedroom
from
his
own
the
door
being
open
she
was
still
kneeling
before
a
trunk
and
he
stood
close
to
her
quite
still
she
knelt
up
straight
and
said
well
jon
i
thought
i
just
come
and
having
given
and
received
another
hug
he
mounted
the
and
tucking
his
legs
up
under
him
watched
her
unpack
he
derived
a
pleasure
from
the
operation
such
as
he
had
not
yet
known
partly
because
she
was
taking
out
things
which
looked
suspicious
and
partly
because
he
liked
to
look
at
her
she
moved
differently
from
anybody
else
especially
from
bella
she
was
certainly
the
person
he
had
ever
seen
she
finished
the
trunk
at
last
and
knelt
down
in
front
of
him
have
you
missed
us
jon
little
jon
nodded
and
having
thus
admitted
his
feelings
continued
to
nod
but
you
had
june
oh
she
had
a
man
with
a
his
mother
face
changed
and
looked
almost
angry
he
added
hastily
he
was
a
poor
man
mum
he
coughed
awfully
liked
his
mother
put
her
hands
behind
his
waist
you
like
everybody
jon
little
jon
considered
up
to
a
point
he
said
auntie
june
took
me
to
church
one
to
church
oh
she
wanted
to
see
how
it
would
affect
and
did
it
yes
i
came
over
all
funny
so
she
took
me
home
again
very
quick
i
was
sick
after
all
i
went
to
bed
and
had
hot
brandy
and
water
and
read
the
boys
of
beechwood
it
was
his
mother
bit
her
lip
when
was
that
oh
long
time
wanted
her
to
take
me
again
but
she
would
you
and
daddy
never
go
to
church
do
you
no
we
why
do
you
his
mother
smiled
well
dear
we
both
of
us
went
when
we
were
little
perhaps
we
went
when
we
were
too
i
see
said
little
jon
it
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
about
all
those
things
as
you
grow
little
jon
replied
in
a
calculating
manner
i
do
want
to
grow
up
much
i
do
want
to
go
to
a
sudden
overwhelming
desire
to
say
something
more
to
say
what
he
really
felt
turned
him
red
want
to
stay
with
you
and
be
your
lover
then
with
an
instinct
to
improve
the
situation
he
added
quickly
i
do
want
to
go
to
bed
either
i
simply
tired
of
going
to
bed
every
have
you
had
any
more
nightmares
only
about
one
may
i
leave
the
door
open
into
your
room
mum
yes
just
a
little
jon
heaved
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
what
did
you
see
in
glensofantrim
nothing
but
beauty
what
exactly
is
beauty
what
exactly
jon
that
a
can
i
see
it
for
instance
his
mother
got
up
and
sat
beside
him
you
do
every
day
the
sky
is
beautiful
the
stars
and
moonlit
nights
and
then
the
birds
the
flowers
the
all
beautiful
look
out
of
the
beauty
for
you
oh
yes
that
the
view
is
that
all
all
no
the
sea
is
wonderfully
beautiful
and
the
waves
with
their
foam
flying
did
you
rise
from
it
every
day
mum
his
mother
smiled
well
we
little
jon
suddenly
reached
out
and
caught
her
neck
in
his
hands
i
know
he
said
mysteriously
you
it
really
and
all
the
rest
is
she
sighed
laughed
said
oh
jon
little
jon
said
critically
do
you
think
bella
beautiful
for
instance
i
hardly
bella
is
young
that
but
you
look
younger
mum
if
you
bump
against
bella
she
i
do
believe
was
beautiful
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
and
mademoiselle
almost
mademoiselle
has
a
very
nice
oh
yes
nice
i
love
your
little
rays
rays
little
jon
put
his
finger
to
the
outer
corner
of
her
eye
oh
those
but
they
a
sign
of
they
come
when
you
but
they
use
oh
well
i
like
them
do
you
love
me
mum
i
do
love
you
ever
so
ever
so
more
than
i
thought
you
did
well
so
do
i
so
that
makes
it
conscious
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
so
given
himself
away
he
felt
a
sudden
reaction
to
the
manliness
of
sir
lamorac
dick
needham
huck
finn
and
other
heroes
shall
i
show
you
a
thing
or
two
he
said
and
slipping
out
of
her
arms
he
stood
on
his
head
then
fired
by
her
obvious
admiration
he
mounted
the
bed
and
threw
himself
head
foremost
from
his
feet
on
to
his
back
without
touching
anything
with
his
hands
he
did
this
several
times
that
evening
having
inspected
what
they
had
brought
he
stayed
up
to
dinner
sitting
between
them
at
the
little
round
table
they
used
when
they
were
alone
he
was
extremely
excited
his
mother
wore
a
dress
with
creamy
lace
made
out
of
little
scriggly
roses
round
her
neck
which
was
browner
than
the
lace
he
kept
looking
at
her
till
at
last
his
father
funny
smile
made
him
suddenly
attentive
to
his
slice
of
pineapple
it
was
later
than
he
had
ever
stayed
up
when
he
went
to
bed
his
mother
went
up
with
him
and
he
undressed
very
slowly
so
as
to
keep
her
there
when
at
last
he
had
nothing
on
but
his
pyjamas
he
said
promise
you
wo
go
while
i
say
my
prayers
i
kneeling
down
and
plunging
his
face
into
the
bed
little
jon
hurried
up
under
his
breath
opening
one
eye
now
and
then
to
see
her
standing
perfectly
still
with
a
smile
on
her
face
our
father
went
his
last
prayer
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
mum
thy
kingdom
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
give
us
this
day
our
daily
mum
and
forgive
us
our
trespasses
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
and
trespass
against
us
for
thine
is
the
evil
the
power
and
the
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amum
look
out
he
sprang
and
for
a
long
minute
remained
in
her
arms
once
in
bed
he
continued
to
hold
her
hand
you
wo
shut
the
door
any
more
than
that
will
you
are
you
going
to
be
long
mum
i
must
go
down
and
play
to
oh

hope

can
sleep
any
well
this
is
just
a
night
like

on
extra
special
nights

but
if

go
to
sleep

i
sha
hear

well
when
i
do

in
and
give
you
a
kiss
then
if
you
awake
you
know
and
if
you
not
you
still
know
you
had
little
jon
sighed
all
right
he
said
i
suppose
i
must
put
up
with
that
mum
yes
what
was
her
name
that
daddy
believes
in
venus
anna
diomedes
oh
my
angel
yes
but
i
like
my
name
for
you
much
what
is
yours
jon
little
jon
answered
shyly
guinevere
it
out
of
the
round
only
just
thought
of
it
only
of
course
her
hair
was
his
mother
eyes
looking
past
him
seemed
to
float
you
wo
forget
to
come
mum
not
if
you
go
to
that
a
bargain
and
little
jon
screwed
up
his
eyes
he
felt
her
lips
on
his
forehead
heard
her
footsteps
opened
his
eyes
to
see
her
gliding
through
the
doorway
and
sighing
screwed
them
up
again
then
time
began
for
some
ten
minutes
of
it
he
tried
loyally
to
sleep
counting
a
great
number
of
thistles
in
a
row
da
old
recipe
for
bringing
slumber
he
seemed
to
have
been
hours
counting
it
must
he
thought
be
nearly
time
for
her
to
come
up
now
he
threw
the
bedclothes
back
i
hot
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
funny
in
the
darkness
like
someone
else
why
did
she
come
he
sat
up
he
must
look
he
got
out
of
bed
went
to
the
window
and
pulled
the
curtain
a
slice
aside
it
was
dark
but
he
could
tell
whether
because
of
daylight
or
the
moon
which
was
very
big
it
had
a
funny
wicked
face
as
if
laughing
at
him
and
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
it
then
remembering
that
his
mother
had
said
moonlit
nights
were
beautiful
he
continued
to
stare
out
in
a
general
way
the
trees
threw
thick
shadows
the
lawn
looked
like
spilt
milk
and
a
long
long
way
he
could
see
oh
very
far
right
over
the
world
and
it
all
looked
different
and
swimmy
there
was
a
lovely
smell
too
in
his
open
window
wish
i
had
a
dove
like
noah
he
thought
the
moony
moon
was
round
and
bright
it
shone
and
shone
and
made
it
after
that
rhyme
which
came
into
his
head
all
at
once
he
became
conscious
of
music
very
mum
playing
he
bethought
himself
of
a
macaroon
he
had
laid
up
in
his
chest
of
drawers
and
getting
it
came
back
to
the
window
he
leaned
out
now
munching
now
holding
his
jaws
to
hear
the
music
better
da
used
to
say
that
angels
played
on
harps
in
heaven
but
it
was
half
so
lovely
as
mum
playing
in
the
moony
night
with
him
eating
a
macaroon
a
cockchafer
buzzed
by
a
moth
flew
in
his
face
the
music
stopped
and
little
jon
drew
his
head
in
she
must
be
coming
he
did
want
to
be
found
awake
he
got
back
into
bed
and
pulled
the
clothes
nearly
over
his
head
but
he
had
left
a
streak
of
moonlight
coming
in
it
fell
across
the
floor
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
he
watched
it
moving
ever
so
slowly
towards
him
as
if
it
were
alive
the
music
began
again
but
he
could
only
just
hear
it
now
sleepy
music
and
time
slipped
by
the
music
rose
fell
ceased
the
moonbeam
crept
towards
his
face
little
jon
turned
in
his
sleep
till
he
lay
on
his
back
with
one
brown
fist
still
grasping
the
bedclothes
the
corners
of
his
eyes
had
begun
to
dream
he
dreamed
he
was
drinking
milk
out
of
a
pan
that
was
the
moon
opposite
a
great
black
cat
which
watched
him
with
a
funny
smile
like
his
father
he
heard
it
whisper
drink
too
much
it
was
the
cat
milk
of
course
and
he
put
out
his
hand
amicably
to
stroke
the
creature
but
it
was
no
longer
there
the
pan
had
become
a
bed
in
which
he
was
lying
and
when
he
tried
to
get
out
he
could
find
the
edge
he
could
find
get
out
it
was
dreadful
he
whimpered
in
his
sleep
the
bed
had
begun
to
go
round
too
it
was
outside
him
and
inside
him
going
round
and
round
and
getting
fiery
and
mother
lee
out
of
cast
up
by
the
sea
was
stirring
it
oh
so
horrible
she
looked
faster
and
faster
he
and
the
bed
and
mother
lee
and
the
moon
and
the
cat
were
all
one
wheel
going
round
and
round
and
up
and
he
shrieked
a
voice
saying
darling
darling
got
through
the
wheel
and
he
awoke
standing
on
his
bed
with
his
eyes
wide
open
there
was
his
mother
with
her
hair
like
guinevere
and
clutching
her
he
buried
his
face
in
it
oh
oh
it
all
right
treasure
you
awake
now
there
there
nothing
but
little
jon
continued
to
say
oh
oh
her
voice
went
on
velvety
in
his
ear
it
was
the
moonlight
sweetheart
coming
on
your
little
jon
burbled
into
her
nightgown
you
said
it
was
beautiful
oh
not
to
sleep
in
jon
who
let
it
in
did
you
draw
the
curtains
i
wanted
to
see
the
time
looked
out
heard
you
playing
mum
ate
my
but
he
was
growing
slowly
comforted
and
the
instinct
to
excuse
his
fear
revived
within
him
mother
lee
went
round
in
me
and
got
all
fiery
he
mumbled
well
jon
what
can
you
expect
if
you
eat
macaroons
after
you
gone
to
bed
only
one
mum
it
made
the
music
ever
so
more
beautiful
i
was
waiting
for
nearly
thought
it
was
my
ducky
it
only
just
eleven
little
jon
was
silent
rubbing
his
nose
on
her
neck
mum
is
daddy
in
your
room
not
can
i
come
if
you
wish
my
half
himself
again
little
jon
drew
back
you
look
different
mum
ever
so
it
my
hair
little
jon
laid
hold
of
it
thick
dark
gold
with
a
few
silver
threads
i
like
it
he
said
i
like
you
best
of
all
like
taking
her
hand
he
had
begun
dragging
her
towards
the
door
he
shut
it
as
they
passed
with
a
sigh
of
relief
which
side
of
the
bed
do
you
like
mum
the
left
all
wasting
no
time
giving
her
no
chance
to
change
her
mind
little
jon
got
into
the
bed
which
seemed
much
softer
than
his
own
he
heaved
another
sigh
screwed
his
head
into
the
pillow
and
lay
examining
the
battle
of
chariots
and
swords
and
spears
which
always
went
on
outside
blankets
where
the
little
hairs
stood
up
against
the
light
it
was
anything
really
was
it
he
said
from
before
her
glass
his
mother
answered
nothing
but
the
moon
and
your
imagination
heated
up
you
must
get
so
excited
but
still
not
quite
in
possession
of
his
nerves
little
jon
answered
boastfully
i
was
afraid
really
of
course
and
again
he
lay
watching
the
spears
and
chariots
it
all
seemed
very
long
oh
mum
do
hurry
up
darling
i
have
to
plait
my
oh
not
you
only
have
to
unplait
it
again
sleepy
now
if
you
do
come
i
sha
be
sleepy
his
mother
stood
up
white
and
flowey
before
the
winged
mirror
he
could
see
three
of
her
with
her
neck
turned
and
her
hair
bright
under
the
light
and
her
dark
eyes
smiling
it
was
unnecessary
and
he
said
do
come
mum
i
very
well
my
love
i
little
jon
closed
his
eyes
everything
was
turning
out
most
satisfactory
only
she
must
hurry
up
he
felt
the
bed
shake
she
was
getting
in
and
still
with
his
eyes
closed
he
said
sleepily
nice
is
it
he
heard
her
voice
say
something
felt
her
lips
touching
his
nose
and
snuggling
up
beside
her
who
lay
awake
and
loved
him
with
her
thoughts
he
fell
into
the
dreamless
sleep
which
rounded
off
his
past
to
let
from
out
the
fatal
loins
of
those
two
foes
a
pair
of
lovers
take
their
and
juliet
to
charles
scribner
part
i
soames
forsyte
emerged
from
the
knightsbridge
hotel
where
he
was
staying
in
the
afternoon
of
the
of
may
with
the
intention
of
visiting
a
collection
of
pictures
in
a
gallery
off
cork
street
and
looking
into
the
future
he
walked
since
the
war
he
never
took
a
cab
if
he
could
help
it
their
drivers
were
in
his
view
an
uncivil
lot
though
now
that
the
war
was
over
and
supply
beginning
to
exceed
demand
again
getting
more
civil
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
human
nature
still
he
had
not
forgiven
them
deeply
identifying
them
with
gloomy
memories
and
now
dimly
like
all
members
of
their
class
with
revolution
the
considerable
anxiety
he
had
passed
through
during
the
war
and
the
more
considerable
anxiety
he
had
since
undergone
in
the
peace
had
produced
psychological
consequences
in
a
tenacious
nature
he
had
mentally
so
frequently
experienced
ruin
that
he
had
ceased
to
believe
in
its
material
probability
paying
away
four
thousand
a
year
in
income
and
super
tax
one
could
not
very
well
be
worse
off
a
fortune
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
encumbered
only
by
a
wife
and
one
daughter
and
very
diversely
invested
afforded
substantial
guarantee
even
against
that
wildcat
notion
a
levy
on
capital
and
as
to
confiscation
of
war
profits
he
was
entirely
in
favour
of
it
for
he
had
none
and
serve
the
beggars
right
the
price
of
pictures
moreover
had
if
anything
gone
up
and
he
had
done
better
with
his
collection
since
the
war
began
than
ever
before
also
had
acted
beneficially
on
a
spirit
congenitally
cautious
and
hardened
a
character
already
dogged
to
be
in
danger
of
being
entirely
dispersed
inclined
one
to
be
less
apprehensive
of
the
more
partial
dispersions
involved
in
levies
and
taxation
while
the
habit
of
condemning
the
impudence
of
the
germans
had
led
naturally
to
condemning
that
of
labour
if
not
openly
at
least
in
the
sanctuary
of
his
soul
he
walked
there
was
moreover
time
to
spare
for
fleur
was
to
meet
him
at
the
gallery
at
four
and
it
was
as
yet
but
two
it
was
good
for
him
to
liver
was
a
little
constricted
and
his
nerves
rather
on
edge
his
wife
was
always
out
when
she
was
in
town
and
his
daughter
would
all
over
the
place
like
most
young
women
since
the
war
still
he
must
be
thankful
that
she
had
been
too
young
to
do
anything
in
that
war
itself
not
of
course
that
he
had
not
supported
the
war
from
its
inception
with
all
his
soul
but
between
that
and
supporting
it
with
the
bodies
of
his
wife
and
daughter
there
had
been
a
gap
fixed
by
something
within
him
which
abhorred
emotional
extravagance
he
had
for
instance
strongly
objected
to
annette
so
attractive
and
in
only
going
to
her
native
france
her
chere
patrie
as
under
the
stimulus
of
war
she
had
begun
to
call
it
to
nurse
her
braves
poilus
forsooth
ruining
her
health
and
her
looks
as
if
she
were
really
a
nurse
he
had
put
a
stopper
on
it
let
her
do
needlework
for
them
at
home
or
knit
she
had
not
gone
therefore
and
had
never
been
quite
the
same
woman
since
a
bad
tendency
of
hers
to
mock
at
him
not
openly
but
in
continual
little
ways
had
grown
as
for
fleur
the
war
had
resolved
the
vexed
problem
whether
or
not
she
should
go
to
school
she
was
better
away
from
her
mother
in
her
war
mood
from
the
chance
of
and
the
impetus
to
do
extravagant
things
so
he
had
placed
her
in
a
seminary
as
far
west
as
had
seemed
to
him
compatible
with
excellence
and
had
missed
her
horribly
fleur
he
had
never
regretted
the
somewhat
outlandish
name
by
which
at
her
birth
he
had
decided
so
suddenly
to
call
concession
though
it
had
been
to
the
french
fleur
a
pretty
pretty
child
but
restless
and
wilful
knowing
her
power
too
over
her
father
soames
often
reflected
on
the
mistake
it
was
to
dote
on
his
daughter
to
get
old
and
dote
he
was
getting
on
but
he
did
feel
it
for
fortunately
perhaps
considering
annette
youth
and
good
looks
his
second
marriage
had
turned
out
a
cool
affair
he
had
known
but
one
real
passion
in
his
that
first
wife
of
yes
and
that
fellow
his
cousin
jolyon
who
had
gone
off
with
her
was
looking
very
shaky
they
said
no
wonder
at
after
twenty
years
of
a
third
marriage
soames
paused
a
moment
in
his
march
to
lean
over
the
railings
of
the
row
a
suitable
spot
for
reminiscence
between
that
house
in
park
lane
which
had
seen
his
birth
and
his
parents
deaths
and
the
little
house
in
montpellier
square
where
years
ago
he
had
enjoyed
his
first
edition
of
matrimony
now
after
twenty
years
of
his
second
edition
that
old
tragedy
seemed
to
him
like
a
previous
had
ended
when
fleur
was
born
in
place
of
the
son
he
had
hoped
for
for
many
years
he
had
ceased
regretting
even
vaguely
the
son
who
had
not
been
born
fleur
filled
the
bill
in
his
heart
after
all
she
bore
his
name
and
he
was
not
looking
forward
at
all
to
the
time
when
she
would
change
it
indeed
if
he
ever
thought
of
such
a
calamity
it
was
seasoned
by
the
vague
feeling
that
he
could
make
her
rich
enough
to
purchase
perhaps
and
extinguish
the
name
of
the
fellow
who
married
not
since
as
it
seemed
women
were
equal
to
men
nowadays
and
soames
secretly
convinced
that
they
were
not
passed
his
curved
hand
over
his
face
vigorously
till
it
reached
the
comfort
of
his
chin
thanks
to
abstemious
habits
he
had
not
grown
fat
and
gabby
his
nose
was
pale
and
thin
his
grey
moustache
his
eyesight
unimpaired
a
slight
stoop
closened
and
corrected
the
expansion
given
to
his
face
by
the
heightening
of
his
forehead
in
the
recession
of
his
grey
hair
little
change
had
time
wrought
in
the
warmest
of
the
young
forsytes
as
the
last
of
the
old
in
his
hundred
and
first
year
would
have
phrased
it
the
shade
from
the
fell
on
his
neat
homburg
hat
he
had
given
up
top
was
no
use
attracting
attention
to
wealth
in
days
like
these
his
thoughts
travelled
sharply
to
easter
before
the
war
when
having
to
make
up
his
mind
about
that
goya
picture
he
had
taken
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
study
the
painter
on
his
spot
the
fellow
had
impressed
range
real
genius
highly
as
the
chap
ranked
he
would
rank
even
higher
before
they
had
finished
with
him
the
second
goya
craze
would
be
greater
even
than
the
first
oh
yes
and
he
had
bought
on
that
visit
he
never
a
copy
of
a
fresco
painting
called
la
vendimia
wherein
was
the
figure
of
a
girl
with
an
arm
akimbo
who
had
reminded
him
of
his
daughter
he
had
it
now
in
the
gallery
at
mapledurham
and
rather
poor
it
could
copy
goya
he
would
still
look
at
it
however
if
his
daughter
were
not
there
for
the
sake
of
something
irresistibly
reminiscent
in
the
light
erect
balance
of
the
figure
the
width
between
the
arching
eyebrows
the
eager
dreaming
of
the
dark
eyes
curious
that
fleur
should
have
dark
eyes
when
his
own
were
pure
forsyte
had
brown
her
mother
blue
but
of
course
her
grandmother
lamotte
eyes
were
dark
as
treacle
he
began
to
walk
on
again
toward
hyde
park
corner
no
greater
change
in
all
england
than
in
the
row
born
almost
within
hail
of
it
he
could
remember
it
from
on
brought
there
as
a
child
between
the
crinolines
to
stare
at
dandies
in
whiskers
riding
with
a
cavalry
seat
to
watch
the
doffing
of
and
white
top
hats
the
leisurely
air
of
it
all
and
the
little
man
in
a
long
red
waistcoat
who
used
to
come
among
the
fashion
with
dogs
on
several
strings
and
try
to
sell
one
to
his
mother
king
charles
spaniels
italian
greyhounds
affectionate
to
her
never
saw
them
now
you
saw
no
quality
of
any
sort
indeed
just
working
people
sitting
in
dull
rows
with
nothing
to
stare
at
but
a
few
young
bouncing
females
in
pot
hats
riding
astride
or
desultory
colonials
charging
up
and
down
on
hacks
with
here
and
there
little
girls
on
ponies
or
old
gentlemen
jogging
their
livers
or
an
orderly
trying
a
great
galumphing
cavalry
horse
no
thoroughbreds
no
grooms
no
bowing
no
scraping
no
only
the
trees
the
trees
indifferent
to
the
generations
and
declensions
of
mankind
a
democratic
hurried
noisy
and
seemingly
without
an
apex
and
that
something
fastidious
in
the
soul
of
soames
turned
over
within
him
gone
forever
the
close
borough
of
rank
and
polish
wealth
there
yes
himself
was
a
richer
man
than
his
father
had
ever
been
but
manners
flavour
quality
all
gone
engulfed
in
one
vast
ugly
cheerio
little
pockets
of
gentility
and
caste
lurking
here
and
there
dispersed
and
chetif
as
annette
would
say
but
nothing
ever
again
firm
and
coherent
to
look
up
to
and
into
this
new
of
bad
manners
and
loose
morals
his
of
his
flung
and
when
those
labour
chaps
got
they
ever
worst
was
yet
to
come
he
passed
out
under
the
archway
at
last
no
goodness
by
the
gungrey
of
its
better
put
a
on
to
where
they
all
going
he
thought
light
up
their
precious
democracy
and
he
directed
his
steps
along
the
club
fronts
of
piccadilly
george
forsyte
of
course
would
be
sitting
in
the
bay
window
of
the
iseeum
the
chap
was
so
big
now
that
he
was
there
nearly
all
his
time
like
some
immovable
sardonic
humorous
eye
noting
the
decline
of
men
and
things
and
soames
hurried
ever
constitutionally
uneasy
beneath
his
cousin
glance
george
who
as
he
had
heard
had
written
a
letter
signed
patriot
in
the
middle
of
the
war
complaining
of
the
government
hysteria
in
docking
the
oats
of
yes
there
he
was
tall
ponderous
neat
with
his
smooth
hair
hardly
thinned
smelling
no
doubt
of
the
best
and
a
pink
paper
in
his
hand
well
he
did
change
and
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
soames
felt
a
kind
of
sympathy
tapping
in
his
waistcoat
for
that
sardonic
kinsman
with
his
weight
his
perfectly
parted
hair
and
gaze
he
was
a
guarantee
that
the
old
order
would
take
some
shifting
yet
he
saw
george
move
the
pink
paper
as
if
inviting
him
to
chap
must
want
to
ask
something
about
his
property
it
was
still
under
soames
control
for
in
the
adoption
of
a
sleeping
partnership
at
that
painful
period
twenty
years
back
when
he
had
divorced
irene
soames
had
found
himself
almost
insensibly
retaining
control
of
all
purely
forsyte
affairs
hesitating
for
just
a
moment
he
nodded
and
went
in
since
the
death
of
his
montague
dartie
in
paris
which
no
one
had
quite
known
what
to
make
of
except
that
it
was
certainly
not
iseeum
club
had
seemed
more
respectable
to
soames
george
too
he
knew
had
sown
the
last
of
his
wild
oats
and
was
committed
definitely
to
the
joys
of
the
table
eating
only
of
the
very
best
so
as
to
keep
his
weight
down
and
owning
as
he
said
just
one
or
two
old
screws
to
give
me
an
interest
in
he
joined
his
cousin
therefore
in
the
bay
window
without
the
embarrassing
sense
of
indiscretion
he
had
been
used
to
feel
up
there
george
put
out
a
hand
have
seen
you
since
the
war
he
said
how
your
wife
thanks
said
soames
coldly
well
some
hidden
jest
curved
for
a
moment
george
fleshy
face
and
gloated
from
his
eye
that
belgian
chap
profond
he
said
is
a
member
here
now
he
a
rum
quite
muttered
soames
what
did
you
want
to
see
me
about
old
timothy
he
might
go
off
the
hooks
at
any
moment
i
suppose
made
his
well
you
or
somebody
ought
to
give
him
a
look
of
the
old
lot
he
a
hundred
you
know
they
say
he
like
a
mummy
where
are
you
goin
to
put
him
he
ought
to
have
a
pyramid
by
soames
shook
his
head
highgate
the
family
well
i
suppose
the
old
girls
would
miss
him
if
he
was
anywhere
else
they
say
he
still
takes
an
interest
in
food
he
might
last
on
you
know
do
we
get
anything
for
the
old
forsytes
ten
of
age
worked
it
out
that
ought
to
be
equal
to
is
that
all
said
soames
i
must
be
getting
unsociable
devil
george
eyes
seemed
to
answer
yes
all
look
him
up
in
his
old
chap
might
want
to
the
grin
died
on
the
rich
curves
of
his
face
and
he
added
have
you
attorneys
invented
a
way
yet
of
dodging
this
damned
income
tax
it
hits
the
fixed
inherited
income
like
the
very
deuce
i
used
to
have
two
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
now
i
got
a
beggarly
fifteen
hundred
and
the
price
of
living
ah
murmured
soames
the
turf
in
over
george
face
moved
a
gleam
of
sardonic
well
he
said
they
brought
me
up
to
do
nothing
and
here
i
am
in
the
sear
and
yellow
getting
poorer
every
day
these
labour
chaps
mean
to
have
the
lot
before
they
done
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
a
living
when
it
comes
i
shall
work
a
day
teaching
politicians
how
to
see
a
joke
take
my
tip
soames
go
into
parliament
make
sure
of
your
four
employ
and
as
soames
retired
he
resumed
his
seat
in
the
bay
window
soames
moved
along
piccadilly
deep
in
reflections
excited
by
his
cousin
words
he
himself
had
always
been
a
worker
and
a
saver
george
always
a
drone
and
a
spender
and
yet
if
confiscation
once
began
it
was
worker
and
the
would
be
looted
that
was
the
negation
of
all
virtue
the
overturning
of
all
forsyte
principles
could
civilization
be
built
on
any
other
he
did
not
think
so
well
they
would
confiscate
his
pictures
for
they
would
know
their
worth
but
what
would
they
be
worth
if
these
maniacs
once
began
to
milk
capital
a
drug
on
the
market
do
care
about
myself
he
thought
could
live
on
five
hundred
a
year
and
never
know
the
difference
at
my
age
but
fleur
this
fortune
so
widely
invested
these
treasures
so
carefully
chosen
and
amassed
were
all
and
if
it
should
turn
out
that
he
could
give
or
leave
them
to
life
had
no
meaning
and
what
was
the
use
of
going
in
to
look
at
this
crazy
futuristic
stuff
with
the
view
of
seeing
whether
it
had
any
future
arriving
at
the
gallery
off
cork
street
however
he
paid
his
shilling
picked
up
a
catalogue
and
entered
some
ten
persons
were
prowling
round
soames
took
steps
and
came
on
what
looked
to
him
like
a
bent
by
collision
with
a
motor
omnibus
it
was
advanced
some
three
paces
from
the
wall
and
was
described
in
his
catalogue
as
he
examined
it
with
curiosity
having
recently
turned
some
of
his
attention
to
sculpture
that
jupiter
he
thought
wonder
what
like
and
suddenly
he
saw
her
opposite
she
appeared
to
him
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
pump
with
two
handles
lightly
clad
in
snow
he
was
still
gazing
at
her
when
two
of
the
prowlers
halted
on
his
left
epatant
he
heard
one
say
jargon
growled
soames
to
himself
the
other
boyish
voice
replied
missed
it
old
bean
he
pulling
your
leg
when
jove
and
juno
created
he
them
he
was
saying
see
how
much
these
fools
will
swallow
and
they
lapped
up
the
you
young
duffer
vospovitch
is
an
innovator
do
you
see
that
brought
satire
into
sculpture
the
future
of
plastic
art
of
music
painting
and
even
architecture
has
set
in
satiric
it
was
bound
to
people
are
bottom
tumbled
out
of
well
i
quite
equal
to
taking
a
little
interest
in
beauty
i
was
through
the
war
you
dropped
your
handkerchief
soames
saw
a
handkerchief
held
out
in
front
of
him
he
took
it
with
some
natural
suspicion
and
approached
it
to
his
nose
it
had
the
right
distant
eau
de
his
initials
in
a
corner
slightly
reassured
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
young
man
face
it
had
rather
ears
a
laughing
mouth
with
half
a
toothbrush
growing
out
of
it
on
each
side
and
small
lively
eyes
above
a
normally
dressed
appearance
thank
you
he
said
and
moved
by
a
sort
of
irritation
added
glad
to
hear
you
like
beauty
that
rare
i
dote
on
it
said
the
young
man
but
you
and
i
are
the
last
of
the
old
guard
soames
smiled
if
you
really
care
for
pictures
he
said
here
my
card
i
can
show
you
some
quite
good
ones
any
sunday
if
you
down
the
river
and
care
to
look
awfully
nice
of
you
sir
i
drop
in
like
a
bird
my
and
he
took
off
his
hat
soames
already
regretting
his
impulse
raised
his
own
slightly
in
response
with
a
downward
look
at
the
young
man
companion
who
had
a
purple
tie
dreadful
little
sluglike
whiskers
and
a
scornful
if
he
were
a
poet
it
was
the
first
indiscretion
he
had
committed
for
so
long
that
he
went
and
sat
down
in
an
alcove
what
had
possessed
him
to
give
his
card
to
a
rackety
young
fellow
who
went
about
with
a
thing
like
that
and
fleur
always
at
the
back
of
his
thoughts
started
out
like
a
filigree
figure
from
a
clock
when
the
hour
strikes
on
the
screen
opposite
the
alcove
was
a
large
canvas
with
a
great
many
square
blobs
on
it
and
nothing
else
so
far
as
soames
could
see
from
where
he
sat
he
looked
at
his
catalogue
no
future
suppose
that
satiric
too
he
thought
a
thing
but
his
second
impulse
was
more
cautious
it
did
not
do
to
condemn
hurriedly
there
had
been
those
stripey
streaky
creations
of
monet
which
had
turned
out
such
trumps
and
then
the
stippled
school
and
gauguin
why
even
since
the
there
had
been
one
or
two
painters
not
to
be
sneezed
at
during
the
years
of
his
connoisseur
life
indeed
he
had
marked
so
many
movements
seen
the
tides
of
taste
and
technique
so
ebb
and
flow
that
there
was
really
no
telling
anything
except
that
there
was
money
to
be
made
out
of
every
change
of
fashion
this
too
might
quite
well
be
a
case
where
one
must
subdue
primordial
instinct
or
lose
the
market
he
got
up
and
stood
before
the
picture
trying
hard
to
see
it
with
the
eyes
of
other
people
above
the
tomato
blobs
was
what
he
took
to
be
a
sunset
till
some
one
passing
said
got
the
airplanes
wonderfully
do
you
think
below
the
tomato
blobs
was
a
band
of
white
with
vertical
black
stripes
to
which
he
could
assign
no
meaning
whatever
till
some
one
else
came
by
murmuring
what
expression
he
gets
with
his
foreground
expression
of
what
soames
went
back
to
his
seat
the
thing
was
rich
as
his
father
would
have
said
and
he
would
give
a
damn
for
it
expression
ah
they
were
all
expressionists
now
he
had
heard
on
the
continent
so
it
was
coming
here
too
was
it
he
remembered
the
first
wave
of
influenza
in
in
china
so
they
said
he
wondered
where
expressionism
had
been
hatched
the
thing
was
a
regular
disease
he
had
become
conscious
of
a
woman
and
a
youth
standing
between
him
and
the
future
their
backs
were
turned
but
very
suddenly
soames
put
his
catalogue
before
his
face
and
drawing
his
hat
forward
gazed
through
the
slit
between
no
mistaking
that
back
elegant
as
ever
though
the
hair
above
had
gone
grey
irene
his
divorced
and
this
no
doubt
that
fellow
jolyon
boy
six
months
older
than
his
own
girl
and
mumbling
over
in
his
mind
the
bitter
days
of
his
divorce
he
rose
to
get
out
of
sight
but
quickly
sat
down
again
she
had
turned
her
head
to
speak
to
her
boy
her
profile
was
still
so
youthful
that
it
made
her
grey
hair
seem
powdery
as
if
and
her
lips
were
smiling
as
soames
first
possessor
of
them
had
never
seen
them
smile
grudgingly
he
admitted
her
still
beautiful
and
in
figure
almost
as
young
as
ever
and
how
that
boy
smiled
back
at
her
emotion
squeezed
soames
heart
the
sight
infringed
his
sense
of
justice
he
grudged
her
that
boy
went
beyond
what
fleur
gave
him
and
it
was
undeserved
their
son
might
have
been
his
son
fleur
might
have
been
her
daughter
if
she
had
kept
straight
he
lowered
his
catalogue
if
she
saw
him
all
the
better
a
reminder
of
her
conduct
in
the
presence
of
her
son
who
probably
knew
nothing
of
it
would
be
a
salutary
touch
from
the
finger
of
that
nemesis
which
surely
must
soon
or
late
visit
her
then
that
such
a
thought
was
extravagant
for
a
forsyte
of
his
age
soames
took
out
his
watch
past
four
fleur
was
late
she
had
gone
to
his
niece
imogen
cardigan
and
there
they
would
keep
her
smoking
cigarettes
and
gossiping
and
that
he
heard
the
boy
laugh
and
say
eagerly
i
say
mum
is
this
by
one
of
auntie
june
lame
ducks
paul
believe
it
is
the
word
produced
a
little
shock
in
soames
he
had
never
heard
her
use
it
and
then
she
saw
him
his
eyes
must
have
had
in
them
something
of
george
forsyte
sardonic
look
for
her
gloved
hand
crisped
the
folds
of
her
frock
her
eyebrows
rose
her
face
went
stony
she
moved
on
it
is
a
caution
said
the
boy
catching
her
arm
again
soames
stared
after
them
that
boy
was
with
a
forsyte
chin
and
eyes
deep
in
but
with
something
sunny
like
a
glass
of
old
sherry
spilled
over
him
his
smile
perhaps
his
hair
better
than
they
two
they
passed
from
his
view
into
the
next
room
and
soames
continued
to
regard
the
future
town
but
saw
it
not
a
little
smile
snarled
up
his
lips
he
was
despising
the
vehemence
of
his
own
feelings
after
all
these
years
ghosts
and
yet
as
one
grew
there
anything
but
what
was
left
yes
there
was
fleur
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
entrance
she
was
due
but
she
would
keep
him
waiting
of
course
and
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
a
sort
of
human
short
slight
form
clad
in
a
djibbah
with
a
metal
belt
and
a
fillet
binding
unruly
hair
all
streaked
with
grey
she
was
talking
to
the
gallery
attendants
and
something
familiar
riveted
his
her
eyes
her
chin
her
hair
her
which
suggested
a
thin
skye
terrier
just
before
its
dinner
surely
june
forsyte
his
cousin
coming
straight
to
his
recess
she
sat
down
beside
him
deep
in
thought
took
out
a
tablet
and
made
a
pencil
note
soames
sat
unmoving
a
confounded
thing
cousinship
disgusting
he
heard
her
murmur
then
as
if
resenting
the
presence
of
an
overhearing
stranger
she
looked
at
him
the
worst
had
happened
soames
soames
turned
his
head
a
very
little
how
are
you
he
said
have
seen
you
for
twenty
no
whatever
made
you
come
here
my
sins
said
soames
what
stuff
stuff
oh
course
it
has
arrived
yet
it
never
will
said
soames
it
must
be
making
a
dead
of
course
it
how
know
it
my
soames
sniffed
from
sheer
surprise
yours
what
on
earth
makes
you
run
a
show
like
this
i
do
treat
art
as
if
it
were
soames
pointed
to
the
future
town
look
at
that
who
going
to
live
in
a
town
like
that
or
with
it
on
his
walls
june
contemplated
the
picture
for
a
moment
it
a
vision
she
said
the
deuce
there
was
silence
then
june
rose
creature
he
thought
well
he
said
you
find
your
young
stepbrother
here
with
a
woman
i
used
to
know
if
you
take
my
advice
you
close
this
june
looked
back
at
him
oh
you
forsyte
she
said
and
moved
on
about
her
light
figure
passing
so
suddenly
away
was
a
look
of
dangerous
decisions
forsyte
of
course
he
was
a
forsyte
and
so
was
she
but
from
the
time
when
as
a
mere
girl
she
brought
bosinney
into
his
life
to
wreck
it
he
had
never
hit
it
off
with
june
and
never
would
and
here
she
was
unmarried
to
this
day
owning
a
gallery
and
suddenly
it
came
to
soames
how
little
he
knew
now
of
his
own
family
the
old
aunts
at
timothy
had
been
dead
so
many
years
there
was
no
for
news
what
had
they
all
done
in
the
war
young
roger
boy
had
been
wounded
john
hayman
second
son
killed
young
nicholas
eldest
had
got
an
o
or
whatever
they
gave
them
they
had
all
joined
up
somehow
he
believed
that
boy
of
jolyon
and
irene
he
supposed
had
been
too
young
his
own
generation
of
course
too
old
though
giles
hayman
had
driven
a
car
for
the
red
jesse
hayman
been
a
special
dromios
had
always
been
of
a
sporting
type
as
for
himself
he
had
given
a
motor
ambulance
read
the
papers
till
he
was
sick
of
them
passed
through
much
anxiety
bought
no
clothes
lost
seven
pounds
in
weight
he
did
know
what
more
he
could
have
done
at
his
age
indeed
thinking
it
over
it
struck
him
that
he
and
his
family
had
taken
this
war
very
differently
to
that
affair
with
the
boers
which
had
been
supposed
to
tax
all
the
resources
of
the
empire
in
that
old
war
of
course
his
nephew
val
dartie
had
been
wounded
that
fellow
jolyon
first
son
had
died
of
enteric
the
dromios
had
gone
out
on
horses
and
june
had
been
a
nurse
but
all
that
had
seemed
in
the
nature
of
a
portent
while
in
this
war
everybody
had
done
their
bit
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
as
a
matter
of
course
it
seemed
to
show
the
growth
of
something
or
perhaps
the
decline
of
something
else
had
the
forsytes
become
less
individual
or
more
imperial
or
less
provincial
or
was
it
simply
that
one
hated
germans
why
did
fleur
come
so
that
he
could
get
away
he
saw
those
three
return
together
from
the
other
room
and
pass
back
along
the
far
side
of
the
screen
the
boy
was
standing
before
the
juno
now
and
suddenly
on
the
other
side
of
her
soames
daughter
with
eyebrows
raised
as
well
they
might
be
he
could
see
her
eyes
glint
sideways
at
the
boy
and
the
boy
look
back
at
her
then
irene
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
drew
him
on
soames
saw
him
glancing
round
and
fleur
looking
after
them
as
the
three
went
out
a
voice
said
cheerfully
bit
thick
is
it
sir
the
young
man
who
had
handed
him
his
handkerchief
was
again
passing
soames
nodded
i
do
know
what
we
coming
oh
that
all
right
sir
answered
the
young
man
cheerfully
they
do
fleur
voice
said
hallo
father
here
you
are
precisely
as
if
he
had
been
keeping
her
waiting
the
young
man
snatching
off
his
hat
passed
on
well
said
soames
looking
her
up
and
down
you
a
punctual
sort
of
young
woman
this
treasured
possession
of
his
life
was
of
medium
height
and
colour
with
short
dark
chestnut
hair
her
brown
eyes
were
set
in
whites
so
clear
that
they
glinted
when
they
moved
and
yet
in
repose
were
almost
dreamy
under
very
white
lids
held
over
them
in
a
sort
of
suspense
she
had
a
charming
profile
and
nothing
of
her
father
in
her
face
save
a
decided
chin
aware
that
his
expression
was
softening
as
he
looked
at
her
soames
frowned
to
preserve
the
unemotionalism
proper
to
a
forsyte
he
knew
she
was
only
too
inclined
to
take
advantage
of
his
weakness
slipping
her
hand
under
his
arm
she
said
who
was
that
he
picked
up
my
handkerchief
we
talked
about
the
you
not
going
to
buy
that
father
no
said
soames
grimly
nor
that
juno
you
been
looking
fleur
dragged
at
his
arm
oh
let
go
it
a
ghastly
in
the
doorway
they
passed
the
young
man
called
mont
and
his
partner
but
soames
had
hung
out
a
board
marked
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
and
he
barely
acknowledged
the
young
fellow
salute
well
he
said
in
the
street
whom
did
you
meet
at
imogen
aunt
winifred
and
that
monsieur
oh
muttered
soames
that
chap
what
does
your
aunt
see
in
him
i
do
know
he
looks
pretty
says
she
likes
soames
grunted
cousin
val
and
his
wife
were
there
what
said
soames
i
thought
they
were
back
in
south
oh
no
they
sold
their
farm
cousin
val
is
going
to
train
on
the
sussex
downs
they
got
a
jolly
old
they
asked
me
down
soames
coughed
the
news
was
distasteful
to
him
what
his
wife
like
now
very
quiet
but
nice
i
soames
coughed
again
he
a
rackety
chap
your
cousin
oh
no
father
they
awfully
devoted
i
promised
to
to
wednesday
training
said
soames
it
was
extravagant
but
not
the
reason
for
his
distaste
why
the
deuce
could
his
nephew
have
stayed
out
in
south
africa
his
own
divorce
had
been
bad
enough
without
his
nephew
marriage
to
the
daughter
of
the
a
too
of
june
and
of
that
boy
whom
fleur
had
just
been
looking
at
from
under
the
if
he
did
look
out
she
would
come
to
know
all
about
that
old
disgrace
unpleasant
things
they
were
round
him
this
afternoon
like
a
swarm
of
bees
i
do
like
it
he
said
i
want
to
see
the
murmured
fleur
and
they
promised
i
shall
ride
cousin
val
ca
walk
much
you
know
but
he
can
ride
perfectly
he
going
to
show
me
their
racing
said
soames
it
a
pity
the
war
did
knock
that
on
the
head
he
taking
after
his
father
i
i
do
know
anything
about
his
no
said
soames
grimly
he
took
an
interest
in
horses
and
broke
his
neck
in
paris
walking
good
riddance
for
your
he
frowned
recollecting
the
inquiry
into
those
stairs
which
he
had
attended
in
paris
six
years
ago
because
montague
dartie
could
not
attend
it
normal
stairs
in
a
house
where
they
played
baccarat
either
his
winnings
or
the
way
he
had
celebrated
them
had
gone
to
his
head
the
french
procedure
had
been
very
loose
he
had
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
it
a
sound
from
fleur
distracted
his
attention
look
the
people
who
were
in
the
gallery
with
what
people
muttered
soames
who
knew
perfectly
well
i
think
that
woman
come
into
this
said
soames
abruptly
and
tightening
his
grip
on
her
arm
he
turned
into
a
confectioner
it
surprising
thing
to
do
and
he
said
rather
anxiously
what
will
you
have
oh
i
do
want
anything
i
had
a
cocktail
and
a
tremendous
we
must
have
something
now
we
here
muttered
soames
keeping
hold
of
her
arm
two
teas
he
said
and
two
of
those
nougat
but
no
sooner
was
his
body
seated
than
his
soul
sprang
up
those
three
were
coming
in
he
heard
irene
say
something
to
her
boy
and
his
answer
oh
no
mum
this
place
is
all
right
my
and
the
three
sat
down
at
that
moment
most
awkward
of
his
existence
crowded
with
ghosts
and
shadows
from
his
past
in
presence
of
the
only
two
women
he
had
ever
divorced
wife
and
his
daughter
by
her
was
not
so
much
afraid
of
them
as
of
his
cousin
june
she
might
make
a
might
introduce
those
two
was
capable
of
anything
he
bit
too
hastily
at
the
nougat
and
it
stuck
to
his
plate
working
at
it
with
his
finger
he
glanced
at
fleur
she
was
masticating
dreamily
but
her
eyes
were
on
the
boy
the

wiggled
his
finger
desperately
plate
did
jolyon
wear
a
plate
did
that
woman
wear
a
plate
time
had
been
when
he
had
seen
her
wearing
nothing
that
was
something
anyway
which
had
never
been
stolen
from
him
and
she
knew
it
though
she
might
sit
there
calm
and
as
if
she
had
never
been
his
wife
an
acid
humour
stirred
in
his
forsyte
blood
a
subtle
pain
divided
by
hair
breadth
from
pleasure
if
only
june
did
not
suddenly
bring
her
hornets
about
his
ears
the
boy
was
talking
of
course
auntie
june
he
called
his
auntie
did
he
she
must
be
fifty
if
she
was
a
day
it
jolly
good
of
you
to
encourage
them
it
all
soames
stole
a
glance
startled
eyes
were
bent
watchfully
on
her
boy
had
these
that
boy
this
boy
he
touched
fleur
arm
and
said
well
have
you
had
enough
one
more
father
she
would
be
sick
he
went
to
the
counter
to
pay
when
he
turned
round
again
he
saw
fleur
standing
near
the
door
holding
a
handkerchief
which
the
boy
had
evidently
just
handed
to
her
f
he
heard
her
say
fleur
mine
all
right
thank
you
ever
good
god
she
had
caught
the
trick
from
what
he
told
her
in
the
forsyte
my
name
too
perhaps
we
really
we
must
be
there
are
any
others
i
live
at
mapledurham
where
do
you
robin
question
and
answer
had
been
so
rapid
that
all
was
over
before
he
could
lift
a
finger
he
saw
irene
face
alive
with
startled
feeling
gave
the
slightest
shake
of
his
head
and
slipped
his
arm
through
fleur
come
along
he
said
she
did
not
move
did
you
hear
father
is
it
name
the
same
are
we
cousins
what
that
he
said
forsyte
distant
my
name
jolyon
sir
jon
for
oh
ah
said
soames
yes
distant
how
are
you
very
good
of
you
he
moved
on
thanks
awfully
fleur
was
saying
au
revoir
au
revoir
he
heard
the
boy
reply
fleur
forsyte
emerging
from
the
soames
first
impulse
was
to
vent
his
nerves
by
saying
to
his
daughter
your
to
which
her
reply
might
well
be
picked
that
up
from
you
his
second
impulse
therefore
was
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
but
she
would
surely
question
him
he
gave
her
a
sidelong
look
and
found
she
was
giving
him
the
same
she
said
softly
why
do
you
like
those
cousins
father
soames
lifted
the
corner
of
his
lip
what
made
you
think
that
cela
se
sees
itself
what
a
way
of
putting
it
after
twenty
years
of
a
french
wife
soames
had
still
little
sympathy
with
her
language
a
theatrical
affair
and
connected
in
his
mind
with
all
the
refinements
of
domestic
irony
how
he
asked
you
must
know
them
and
you
did
make
a
sign
i
saw
them
looking
at
i
never
seen
the
boy
in
my
life
replied
soames
with
perfect
truth
no
but
you
seen
the
others
soames
gave
her
another
look
what
had
she
picked
up
had
her
aunt
winifred
or
imogen
or
val
dartie
and
his
wife
been
talking
every
breath
of
the
old
scandal
had
been
carefully
kept
from
her
at
home
and
winifred
warned
many
times
that
he
would
have
a
whisper
of
it
reach
her
for
the
world
so
far
as
she
ought
to
know
he
had
never
been
married
before
but
her
dark
eyes
whose
southern
glint
and
clearness
often
almost
frightened
him
met
his
with
perfect
innocence
well
he
said
your
grandfather
and
his
brother
had
a
quarrel
the
two
families
do
know
each
how
romantic
what
does
she
mean
by
that
he
thought
the
word
was
to
him
extravagant
and
was
as
if
she
had
said
how
jolly
and
they
continue
not
to
know
each
other
he
added
but
instantly
regretted
the
challenge
in
those
words
fleur
was
smiling
in
this
age
when
young
people
prided
themselves
on
going
their
own
ways
and
paying
no
attention
to
any
sort
of
decent
prejudice
he
had
said
the
very
thing
to
excite
her
wilfulness
then
recollecting
the
expression
on
face
he
breathed
again
what
sort
of
a
quarrel
he
heard
fleur
say
about
a
house
it
ancient
history
for
you
your
grandfather
died
the
day
you
were
born
he
was
ninety
are
there
many
forsytes
besides
those
in
the
red
book
i
do
know
said
soames
they
all
dispersed
now
the
old
ones
are
dead
except
fleur
clasped
her
hands
timothy
is
that
delicious
not
at
all
said
soames
it
offended
him
that
she
should
think
timothy
kind
of
insult
to
his
breed
this
new
generation
mocked
at
anything
solid
and
tenacious
you
go
and
see
the
old
boy
he
might
want
to
ah
if
timothy
could
see
the
disquiet
england
of
his
and
he
would
certainly
give
tongue
and
involuntarily
he
glanced
up
at
the
iseeum
was
still
in
the
window
with
the
same
pink
paper
in
his
hand
where
is
robin
hill
father
robin
hill
robin
hill
round
which
all
that
tragedy
had
centred
what
did
she
want
to
know
for
in
surrey
he
muttered
not
far
from
richmond
why
is
the
house
there
what
house
that
they
quarrelled
yes
but
what
all
that
to
do
with
you
we
going
home
better
be
thinking
about
your
bless
you
they
all
thought
about
a
family
feud
it
like
the
bible
or
mark
exciting
what
did
you
do
in
the
feud
father
never
you
oh
but
if
i
to
keep
it
up
who
said
you
were
to
keep
it
up
you
i
i
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
just
what
i
think
you
know
so
that
all
she
was
too
sharp
for
him
fine
as
annette
sometimes
called
her
nothing
for
it
but
to
distract
her
attention
there
a
bit
of
rosaline
point
in
here
he
said
stopping
before
a
shop
that
i
thought
you
might
when
he
had
paid
for
it
and
they
had
resumed
their
progress
fleur
said
do
you
think
that
boy
mother
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
her
age
you
ever
seen
soames
shivered
uncanny
the
way
she
stuck
to
it
i
do
know
that
i
noticed
dear
i
saw
the
corner
of
your
you
see
a
great
deal
more
it
seems
to
me
what
her
husband
like
he
must
be
your
first
cousin
if
your
fathers
were
dead
for
all
i
know
said
soames
with
sudden
vehemence
i
seen
him
for
twenty
what
was
he
a
that
quite
the
words
if
you
want
to
please
me
you
put
those
people
out
of
your
head
sprang
to
soames
lips
but
he
choked
them
must
not
let
her
see
his
feelings
he
once
insulted
me
he
said
her
quick
eyes
rested
on
his
face
i
see
you
did
avenge
it
and
it
rankles
poor
father
you
let
me
have
a
go
it
was
really
like
lying
in
the
dark
with
a
mosquito
hovering
above
his
face
such
pertinacity
in
fleur
was
new
to
him
and
as
they
reached
the
hotel
he
said
grimly
i
did
my
best
and
that
enough
about
these
people
i
going
up
till
i
shall
sit
with
a
parting
look
at
her
extended
in
a
look
moved
into
the
lift
and
was
transported
to
their
suite
on
the
fourth
floor
he
stood
by
the
window
of
the
which
gave
view
over
hyde
park
and
drummed
a
finger
on
its
pane
his
feelings
were
confused
tetchy
troubled
the
throb
of
that
old
wound
scarred
over
by
time
and
new
interests
was
mingled
with
displeasure
and
anxiety
and
a
slight
pain
in
his
chest
where
that
nougat
stuff
had
disagreed
had
annette
come
in
not
that
she
was
any
good
to
him
in
such
a
difficulty
whenever
she
had
questioned
him
about
his
first
marriage
he
had
always
shut
her
up
she
knew
nothing
of
it
save
that
it
had
been
the
great
passion
of
his
life
and
his
marriage
with
herself
but
domestic
makeshift
she
had
always
kept
the
grudge
of
that
up
her
sleeve
as
it
were
and
used
it
commercially
he
listened
a
vague
murmur
of
a
woman
coming
through
the
door
she
was
in
he
tapped
who
i
said
soames
she
had
been
changing
her
frock
and
was
still
imperfectly
clothed
a
striking
figure
before
her
glass
there
was
a
certain
magnificence
about
her
arms
shoulders
hair
which
had
darkened
since
he
first
knew
her
about
the
turn
of
her
neck
the
silkiness
of
her
garments
her
greyblue
was
certainly
as
handsome
at
forty
as
she
had
ever
been
a
fine
possession
an
excellent
housekeeper
a
sensible
and
affectionate
enough
mother
if
only
she
were
always
so
frankly
cynical
about
the
relations
between
them
soames
who
had
no
more
real
affection
for
her
than
she
had
for
him
suffered
from
a
kind
of
english
grievance
in
that
she
had
never
dropped
even
the
thinnest
veil
of
sentiment
over
their
partnership
like
most
of
his
countrymen
and
women
he
held
the
view
that
marriage
should
be
based
on
mutual
love
but
that
when
from
a
marriage
love
had
disappeared
or
been
found
never
to
have
really
that
it
was
manifestly
not
based
on
must
not
admit
it
there
it
was
and
the
love
was
there
you
were
and
must
continue
to
be
thus
you
had
it
both
ways
and
were
not
tarred
with
cynicism
realism
and
immorality
like
the
french
moreover
it
was
necessary
in
the
interests
of
property
he
knew
that
she
knew
that
they
both
knew
there
was
no
love
between
them
but
he
still
expected
her
not
to
admit
in
words
or
conduct
such
a
thing
and
he
could
never
understand
what
she
meant
when
she
talked
of
the
hypocrisy
of
the
english
he
said
whom
have
you
got
at
shelter
next
week
annette
went
on
touching
her
lips
delicately
with
always
wished
she
would
do
that
your
sister
winifred
and
the
took
up
a
tiny
stick
of
and
prosper
that
belgian
chap
why
him
annette
turned
her
neck
lazily
touched
one
eyelash
and
said
he
amuses
i
want
some
one
to
amuse
fleur
she
repeated
annette
is
it
the
first
time
you
see
that
my
friend
she
was
born
as
you
call
would
she
never
get
that
affected
roll
out
of
her
r
he
touched
the
dress
she
had
taken
off
and
asked
what
have
you
been
doing
annette
looked
at
him
reflected
in
her
glass
her
lips
smiled
rather
full
rather
ironical
enjoying
myself
she
said
oh
answered
soames
glumly
ribbandry
i
it
was
his
word
for
all
that
incomprehensible
running
in
and
out
of
shops
that
women
went
in
for
has
fleur
got
her
summer
dresses
you
do
ask
if
i
have
you
do
care
whether
i
do
or
quite
right
well
she
has
and
i
have
h
said
soames
what
does
that
chap
profond
do
in
england
annette
raised
the
eyebrows
she
had
just
finished
he
ah
said
soames
he
a
sleepy
sometimes
answered
annette
and
her
face
had
a
sort
of
quiet
enjoyment
but
sometimes
very
he
got
a
touch
of
the
about
annette
stretched
herself
she
said
what
is
that
his
mother
was
that
it
then
muttered
soames
does
he
know
anything
about
pictures
he
knows
about
man
of
the
well
get
some
one
for
fleur
i
want
to
distract
her
she
going
off
on
saturday
to
val
dartie
and
his
wife
i
do
like
why
not
since
the
reason
could
not
be
explained
without
going
into
family
history
soames
merely
answered
racketing
about
there
too
much
of
i
like
that
little
val
she
is
very
quiet
and
i
know
nothing
of
her
thing
and
soames
took
up
a
creation
from
the
bed
annette
received
it
from
him
would
you
hook
me
she
said
soames
hooked
glancing
once
over
her
shoulder
into
the
glass
he
saw
the
expression
on
her
face
faintly
amused
faintly
contemptuous
as
much
as
to
say
thanks
you
will
never
learn
no
thank
god
he
a
frenchman
he
finished
with
a
jerk
and
the
words
it
too
low
and
he
went
to
the
door
with
the
wish
to
get
away
from
her
and
go
down
to
fleur
again
annette
stayed
a
and
said
with
startling
suddenness
que
tu
es
grossier
he
knew
the
had
reason
to
the
first
time
she
had
used
it
he
had
thought
it
meant
what
a
grocer
you
are
and
had
not
known
whether
to
be
relieved
or
not
when
better
informed
he
resented
the
was
not
coarse
if
he
was
coarse
what
was
that
chap
in
the
room
beyond
his
who
made
those
horrible
noises
in
the
morning
when
he
cleared
his
throat
or
those
people
in
the
lounge
who
thought
it
to
say
nothing
but
what
the
whole
world
could
hear
at
the
top
of
their
inanity
coarse
because
he
had
said
her
dress
was
low
well
so
it
was
he
went
out
without
reply
coming
into
the
lounge
from
the
far
end
he
at
once
saw
fleur
where
he
had
left
her
she
sat
with
crossed
knees
slowly
balancing
a
foot
in
silk
stocking
and
grey
shoe
sure
sign
that
she
was
dreaming
her
eyes
showed
it
went
off
like
that
sometimes
and
then
in
a
moment
she
would
come
to
life
and
be
as
quick
and
restless
as
a
monkey
and
she
knew
so
much
so
and
not
yet
nineteen
what
was
that
odious
word
flapper
dreadful
young
and
squawking
and
showing
their
legs
the
worst
of
them
bad
dreams
the
best
of
them
powdered
angels
fleur
was
not
a
flapper
not
one
of
those
slangy
young
females
and
yet
she
was
frighteningly
and
full
of
life
and
determined
to
enjoy
it
enjoy
the
word
brought
no
puritan
terror
to
soames
but
it
brought
the
terror
suited
to
his
temperament
he
had
always
been
afraid
to
enjoy
for
fear
he
might
not
enjoy
tomorrow
so
much
and
it
was
terrifying
to
feel
that
his
daughter
was
divested
of
that
safeguard
the
very
way
she
sat
in
that
chair
showed
in
her
dream
he
had
never
been
lost
in
a
dream
was
nothing
to
be
had
out
of
it
and
where
she
got
it
from
he
did
not
know
certainly
not
from
annette
and
yet
annette
as
a
young
girl
when
he
was
hanging
about
her
had
once
had
a
flowery
look
well
she
had
lost
it
now
fleur
rose
from
her
restlessly
and
flung
herself
down
at
a
seizing
ink
and
writing
paper
she
began
to
write
as
if
she
had
not
time
to
breathe
before
she
got
her
letter
written
and
suddenly
she
saw
him
the
air
of
desperate
absorption
vanished
she
smiled
waved
a
kiss
made
a
pretty
face
as
if
she
were
a
little
puzzled
and
a
little
bored
ah
she
was
fine
fine
robin
hill
jolyon
forsyte
had
spent
his
boy
nineteenth
birthday
at
robin
hill
quietly
going
into
his
affairs
he
did
everything
quietly
now
because
his
heart
was
in
a
poor
way
and
like
all
his
family
he
disliked
the
idea
of
dying
he
had
never
realised
how
much
till
one
day
two
years
ago
he
had
gone
to
his
doctor
about
certain
symptoms
and
been
told
at
any
moment
on
any
he
had
taken
it
with
a
natural
forsyte
reaction
against
an
unpleasant
truth
but
with
an
increase
of
symptoms
in
the
train
on
the
way
home
he
had
realised
to
the
full
the
sentence
hanging
over
him
to
leave
irene
his
boy
his
home
his
he
did
little
enough
work
now
to
leave
them
for
unknown
darkness
for
the
unimaginable
state
for
such
nothingness
that
he
would
not
even
be
conscious
of
wind
stirring
leaves
above
his
grave
nor
of
the
scent
of
earth
and
grass
of
such
nothingness
that
however
hard
he
might
try
to
conceive
it
he
never
could
and
must
still
hover
on
the
hope
that
he
might
see
again
those
he
loved
to
realise
this
was
to
endure
very
poignant
spiritual
anguish
before
he
reached
home
that
day
he
had
determined
to
keep
it
from
irene
he
would
have
to
be
more
careful
than
man
had
ever
been
for
the
least
thing
would
give
it
away
and
make
her
as
wretched
as
himself
almost
his
doctor
had
passed
him
sound
in
other
respects
and
seventy
was
nothing
of
an
would
last
a
long
time
yet
if
he
could
such
a
conclusion
followed
out
for
nearly
two
years
develops
to
the
full
the
subtler
side
of
character
naturally
not
abrupt
except
when
nervously
excited
jolyon
had
become
control
incarnate
the
sad
patience
of
old
people
who
can
not
exert
themselves
was
masked
by
a
smile
which
his
lips
preserved
even
in
private
he
devised
continually
all
manner
of
cover
to
conceal
his
enforced
lack
of
exertion
mocking
himself
for
so
doing
he
counterfeited
conversion
to
the
simple
life
gave
up
wine
and
cigars
drank
a
special
kind
of
coffee
with
no
coffee
in
it
in
short
he
made
himself
as
safe
as
a
forsyte
in
his
condition
could
under
the
rose
of
his
mild
irony
secure
from
discovery
since
his
wife
and
son
had
gone
up
to
town
he
had
spent
the
fine
may
day
quietly
arranging
his
papers
that
he
might
die
without
inconveniencing
any
one
giving
in
fact
a
final
polish
to
his
terrestrial
state
having
docketed
and
enclosed
it
in
his
old
chinese
cabinet
he
put
the
key
into
an
envelope
wrote
the
words
outside
key
of
the
chinese
cabinet
wherein
will
be
found
the
exact
state
of
me
and
put
it
in
his
where
it
would
be
always
about
him
in
case
of
accident
then
ringing
for
tea
he
went
out
to
have
it
under
the
old
all
are
under
sentence
of
death
jolyon
whose
sentence
was
but
a
little
more
precise
and
pressing
had
become
so
used
to
it
that
he
thought
habitually
like
other
people
of
other
things
he
thought
of
his
son
now
jon
was
nineteen
that
day
and
jon
had
come
of
late
to
a
decision
educated
neither
at
eton
like
his
father
nor
at
harrow
like
his
dead
but
at
one
of
those
establishments
which
designed
to
avoid
the
evil
and
contain
the
good
of
the
public
school
system
may
or
may
not
contain
the
evil
and
avoid
the
good
jon
had
left
in
april
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
he
wanted
to
become
the
war
which
had
promised
to
go
on
for
ever
had
ended
just
as
he
was
about
to
join
the
army
six
months
before
his
time
it
had
taken
him
ever
since
to
get
used
to
the
idea
that
he
could
now
choose
for
himself
he
had
held
with
his
father
several
discussions
from
which
under
a
cheery
show
of
being
ready
for
of
course
the
church
army
law
stage
stock
exchange
medicine
business
and
had
gathered
rather
clearly
that
jon
wanted
to
go
in
for
nothing
he
himself
had
felt
exactly
like
that
at
the
same
age
with
him
that
pleasant
vacuity
had
soon
been
ended
by
an
early
marriage
and
its
unhappy
consequences
forced
to
become
an
underwriter
at
lloyd
he
had
regained
prosperity
before
his
artistic
talent
had
outcropped
but
the
simple
learned
his
boy
to
draw
pigs
and
other
animals
he
knew
that
jon
would
never
be
a
painter
and
inclined
to
the
conclusion
that
his
aversion
from
everything
else
meant
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
writer
holding
however
the
view
that
experience
was
necessary
even
for
that
profession
there
seemed
to
jolyon
nothing
in
the
meantime
for
jon
but
university
travel
and
perhaps
the
eating
of
dinners
for
the
bar
after
that
one
would
see
or
more
probably
one
would
not
in
face
of
these
proffered
allurements
however
jon
had
remained
undecided
such
discussions
with
his
son
had
confirmed
in
jolyon
a
doubt
whether
the
world
had
really
changed
people
said
that
it
was
a
new
age
with
the
profundity
of
one
not
too
long
for
any
age
jolyon
perceived
that
under
slightly
different
surfaces
the
era
was
precisely
what
it
had
been
mankind
was
still
divided
into
two
species
the
few
who
had
speculation
in
their
souls
and
the
many
who
had
none
with
a
belt
of
hybrids
like
himself
in
the
middle
jon
appeared
to
have
speculation
it
seemed
to
his
father
a
bad
lookout
with
something
deeper
therefore
than
his
usual
smile
he
had
heard
the
boy
say
a
fortnight
ago
i
should
like
to
try
farming
dad
if
it
wo
cost
you
too
much
it
seems
to
be
about
the
only
sort
of
life
that
does
hurt
anybody
except
art
and
of
course
that
out
of
the
question
for
jolyon
subdued
his
smile
and
answered
all
right
you
shall
skip
back
to
where
we
were
under
the
first
jolyon
in
it
prove
the
cycle
theory
and
incidentally
no
doubt
you
may
grow
a
better
turnip
than
he
a
little
dashed
jon
had
answered
but
do
you
think
it
a
good
scheme
dad
serve
my
dear
and
if
you
should
really
take
to
it
you
do
more
good
than
most
men
which
is
little
to
himself
however
he
had
said
he
wo
take
to
it
i
give
him
four
years
still
it
healthy
and
harmless
after
turning
the
matter
over
and
consulting
with
irene
he
wrote
to
his
daughter
val
dartie
asking
if
they
knew
of
a
farmer
near
them
on
the
downs
who
would
take
jon
as
an
apprentice
holly
answer
had
been
enthusiastic
there
was
an
excellent
man
quite
close
she
and
val
would
love
jon
to
live
with
them
the
boy
was
due
to
go
sipping
weak
tea
with
lemon
in
it
jolyon
gazed
through
the
leaves
of
the
old
at
that
view
which
had
appeared
to
him
desirable
for
years
the
tree
beneath
which
he
sat
seemed
not
a
day
older
so
young
the
little
leaves
of
brownish
gold
so
old
the
of
its
thick
rough
trunk
a
tree
of
memories
which
would
live
on
hundreds
of
years
yet
unless
some
barbarian
cut
it
see
old
england
out
at
the
pace
things
were
going
he
remembered
a
night
three
years
before
when
looking
from
his
window
with
his
arm
close
round
irene
he
had
watched
a
german
aeroplane
hovering
it
seemed
right
over
the
old
tree
next
day
they
had
found
a
bomb
hole
in
a
field
on
gage
farm
that
was
before
he
knew
that
he
was
under
sentence
of
death
he
could
almost
have
wished
the
bomb
had
finished
him
it
would
have
saved
a
lot
of
hanging
about
many
hours
of
cold
fear
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
had
counted
on
living
to
the
normal
forsyte
age
of
or
more
when
irene
would
be
seventy
as
it
was
she
would
miss
him
still
there
was
jon
more
important
in
her
life
than
himself
jon
who
adored
his
mother
under
that
tree
where
old
for
irene
to
come
to
him
across
the
breathed
his
last
jolyon
wondered
whimsically
whether
having
put
everything
in
such
perfect
order
he
had
not
better
close
his
own
eyes
and
drift
away
there
was
something
undignified
in
parasitically
clinging
on
to
the
effortless
close
of
a
life
wherein
he
regretted
two
things
long
division
between
his
father
and
himself
when
he
was
young
and
the
lateness
of
his
union
with
irene
from
where
he
sat
he
could
see
a
cluster
of
in
blossom
nothing
in
nature
moved
him
so
much
as
in
blossom
and
his
heart
ached
suddenly
because
he
might
never
see
them
flower
again
spring
decidedly
no
man
ought
to
have
to
die
while
his
heart
was
still
young
enough
to
love
beauty
blackbirds
sang
recklessly
in
the
shrubbery
swallows
were
flying
high
the
leaves
above
him
glistened
and
over
the
fields
was
every
imaginable
tint
of
early
foliage
burnished
by
the
level
sunlight
away
to
where
the
distant
blue
was
trailed
along
the
horizon
irene
flowers
in
their
narrow
beds
had
startling
individuality
that
evening
little
deep
assertions
of
gay
life
only
chinese
and
japanese
painters
and
perhaps
leonardo
had
known
how
to
get
that
startling
little
ego
into
each
painted
flower
and
bird
and
ego
yet
the
sense
of
species
the
universality
of
life
as
well
they
were
the
fellows
made
nothing
that
will
live
thought
jolyon
been
an
mere
lover
not
a
creator
still
i
shall
leave
jon
behind
me
when
i
go
what
luck
that
the
boy
had
not
been
caught
by
that
ghastly
war
he
might
so
easily
have
been
killed
like
poor
jolly
twenty
years
ago
out
in
the
transvaal
jon
would
do
something
some
the
age
did
spoil
imaginative
chap
his
whim
to
take
up
farming
was
but
a
bit
of
sentiment
and
about
as
likely
to
last
and
just
then
he
saw
them
coming
up
the
field
irene
and
the
boy
walking
from
the
station
with
their
arms
linked
and
getting
up
he
strolled
down
through
the
new
rose
garden
to
meet
them
irene
came
into
his
room
that
night
and
sat
down
by
the
window
she
sat
there
without
speaking
till
he
said
what
is
it
my
love
we
had
an
encounter
with
whom
soames
he
had
kept
that
name
out
of
his
thoughts
these
last
two
years
conscious
that
it
was
bad
for
him
and
now
his
heart
moved
in
a
disconcerting
manner
as
if
it
had
within
his
chest
irene
went
on
quietly
he
and
his
daughter
were
in
the
gallery
and
afterward
at
the
confectioner
where
we
had
jolyon
went
over
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
how
did
he
look
grey
but
otherwise
much
the
and
the
daughter
pretty
at
least
jon
thought
jolyon
heart
again
his
wife
face
had
a
strained
and
puzzled
look
you
he
began
no
but
jon
knows
their
name
the
girl
dropped
her
handkerchief
and
he
picked
it
jolyon
sat
down
on
his
bed
an
evil
chance
june
was
with
you
did
she
put
her
foot
into
it
no
but
it
was
all
very
queer
and
strained
and
jon
could
see
it
jolyon
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
i
often
wondered
whether
we
been
right
to
keep
it
from
him
find
out
some
the
later
the
better
jolyon
the
young
have
such
cheap
hard
judgment
when
you
were
nineteen
what
would
you
have
thought
of
your
mother
if
she
had
done
what
i
have
yes
there
it
was
jon
worshipped
his
mother
and
knew
nothing
of
the
tragedies
the
inexorable
necessities
of
life
nothing
of
the
prisoned
grief
in
an
unhappy
marriage
nothing
of
jealousy
or
nothing
at
all
as
yet
what
have
you
told
him
he
said
at
last
that
they
were
relations
but
we
did
know
them
that
you
had
never
cared
much
for
your
family
or
they
for
you
i
expect
he
will
be
asking
jolyon
smiled
this
promises
to
take
the
place
of
he
said
after
all
one
misses
irene
looked
up
at
him
we
known
it
would
come
some
he
answered
her
with
sudden
energy
i
could
never
stand
seeing
jon
blame
you
he
sha
do
that
even
in
thought
he
has
imagination
and
he
understand
if
it
put
to
him
properly
i
think
i
had
better
tell
him
before
he
gets
to
know
not
yet
that
was
like
had
no
foresight
and
never
went
to
meet
trouble
knew
might
be
right
it
was
ill
going
against
a
instinct
it
might
be
well
to
let
the
boy
go
on
if
possible
till
experience
had
given
him
some
touchstone
by
which
he
could
judge
the
values
of
that
old
tragedy
till
love
jealousy
longing
had
deepened
his
charity
all
the
same
one
must
take
precaution
possible
and
long
after
irene
had
left
him
he
lay
awake
turning
over
those
precautions
he
must
write
to
holly
telling
her
that
jon
knew
nothing
as
yet
of
family
history
holly
was
discreet
she
would
make
sure
of
her
husband
she
would
see
to
it
jon
could
take
the
letter
with
him
when
he
went
and
so
the
day
on
which
he
had
put
the
polish
on
his
material
estate
died
out
with
the
chiming
of
the
stable
clock
and
another
began
for
jolyon
in
the
shadow
of
a
spiritual
disorder
which
could
not
be
so
rounded
off
and
polished
but
jon
whose
room
had
once
been
his
day
nursery
lay
awake
too
the
prey
of
a
sensation
disputed
by
those
who
have
never
known
it
love
at
first
sight
he
had
felt
it
beginning
in
him
with
the
glint
of
those
dark
eyes
gazing
into
his
athwart
the
conviction
that
this
was
his
so
that
what
followed
had
seemed
to
him
at
once
natural
and
miraculous
fleur
her
name
alone
was
almost
enough
for
one
who
was
terribly
susceptible
to
the
charm
of
words
in
a
homoeopathic
age
when
boys
and
girls
were
and
mixed
up
in
early
life
till
sex
was
almost
abolished
jon
was
singularly
his
modern
school
took
boys
only
and
his
holidays
had
been
spent
at
robin
hill
with
boy
friends
or
his
parents
alone
he
had
never
therefore
been
inoculated
against
the
germs
of
love
by
small
doses
of
the
poison
and
now
in
the
dark
his
temperature
was
mounting
fast
he
lay
awake
featuring
they
called
her
words
especially
that
au
revoir
so
soft
and
sprightly
he
was
still
so
wide
awake
at
dawn
that
he
got
up
slipped
on
tennis
shoes
trousers
and
a
sweater
and
in
silence
crept
downstairs
and
out
through
the
study
window
it
was
just
light
there
was
a
smell
of
grass
he
thought
it
was
mysteriously
white
out
of
doors
with
nothing
awake
except
the
birds
just
beginning
to
chirp
go
down
into
the
coppice
he
thought
he
ran
down
through
the
fields
reached
the
pond
just
as
the
sun
rose
and
passed
into
the
coppice
bluebells
carpeted
the
ground
there
among
the
there
was
air
as
it
were
composed
of
that
romantic
quality
jon
sniffed
its
freshness
and
stared
at
the
bluebells
in
the
sharpening
light
fleur
it
rhymed
with
her
and
she
lived
at
jolly
name
too
on
the
river
somewhere
he
could
find
it
in
the
atlas
presently
he
would
write
to
her
but
would
she
answer
oh
she
must
she
had
said
au
revoir
not
what
luck
that
she
had
dropped
her
handkerchief
he
would
never
have
known
her
but
for
that
and
the
more
he
thought
of
that
handkerchief
the
more
amazing
his
luck
seemed
fleur
it
certainly
rhymed
with
her
rhythm
thronged
his
head
words
jostled
to
be
joined
together
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
poem
jon
remained
in
this
condition
for
more
than
half
an
hour
then
returned
to
the
house
and
getting
a
ladder
climbed
in
at
his
bedroom
window
out
of
sheer
exhilaration
then
remembering
that
the
study
window
was
open
he
went
down
and
shut
it
first
removing
the
ladder
so
as
to
obliterate
all
traces
of
his
feeling
the
thing
was
too
deep
to
be
revealed
to
mortal
his
mother
mausoleum
there
are
houses
whose
souls
have
passed
into
the
limbo
of
time
leaving
their
bodies
in
the
limbo
of
london
such
was
not
quite
the
condition
of
timothy
on
the
bayswater
road
for
timothy
soul
still
had
one
foot
in
timothy
forsyte
body
and
smither
kept
the
atmosphere
unchanging
of
camphor
and
port
wine
and
house
whose
windows
are
only
opened
to
air
it
twice
a
day
to
forsyte
imagination
that
house
was
now
a
sort
of
chinese
a
series
of
layers
in
the
last
of
which
was
timothy
one
did
not
reach
him
or
so
it
was
reported
by
members
of
the
family
who
out
of
habit
or
absentmindedness
would
drive
up
once
in
a
blue
moon
and
ask
after
their
surviving
uncle
such
were
francie
now
quite
emancipated
from
god
she
frankly
avowed
atheism
euphemia
emancipated
from
old
nicholas
and
winifred
dartie
from
her
man
of
the
but
after
all
everybody
was
emancipated
now
or
said
they
not
quite
the
same
thing
when
soames
therefore
took
it
on
his
way
to
paddington
station
on
the
morning
after
that
encounter
it
was
hardly
with
the
expectation
of
seeing
timothy
in
the
flesh
his
heart
made
a
faint
demonstration
within
him
while
he
stood
in
full
south
sunlight
on
the
newly
whitened
doorstep
of
that
little
house
where
four
forsytes
had
once
lived
and
now
but
one
dwelt
on
like
a
winter
fly
the
house
into
which
soames
had
come
and
out
of
which
he
had
gone
times
without
number
divested
of
or
burdened
with
fardels
of
family
gossip
the
house
of
the
old
people
of
another
century
another
age
the
sight
of
corseted
up
to
the
armpits
because
the
new
fashion
which
came
in
as
they
were
going
out
about
had
never
been
considered
nice
by
aunts
juley
and
a
pale
friendliness
to
soames
lips
smither
still
faithfully
arranged
to
old
pattern
in
every
detail
an
invaluable
such
back
at
him
with
the
words
why
it
soames
after
all
this
time
and
how
are
you
sir
timothy
will
be
so
pleased
to
know
you
how
is
he
oh
he
keeps
fairly
bobbish
for
his
age
sir
but
of
course
he
a
wonderful
man
as
i
said
to
dartie
when
she
was
here
last
it
would
please
miss
forsyte
and
juley
and
miss
hester
to
see
how
he
relishes
a
baked
apple
still
but
he
quite
deaf
and
a
mercy
i
always
think
for
what
we
should
have
done
with
him
in
the
i
ah
said
soames
what
did
you
do
with
him
we
just
left
him
in
his
bed
and
had
the
bell
run
down
into
the
cellar
so
that
cook
and
i
could
hear
him
if
he
rang
it
would
never
have
done
to
let
him
know
there
was
a
war
on
as
i
said
to
cook
timothy
rings
they
may
do
what
they
going
up
my
dear
mistresses
would
have
a
fit
if
they
could
see
him
ringing
and
nobody
going
to
him
but
he
slept
through
them
all
beautiful
and
the
one
in
the
daytime
he
was
having
his
bath
it
was
a
mercy
because
he
might
have
noticed
the
people
in
the
street
all
looking
often
looks
out
of
the
quite
murmured
soames
smither
was
getting
garrulous
i
just
want
to
look
round
and
see
if
there
anything
to
be
yes
sir
i
do
think
there
anything
except
a
smell
of
mice
in
the
that
we
do
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
funny
they
should
be
there
and
not
a
crumb
since
timothy
took
to
not
coming
down
just
before
the
war
but
they
nasty
little
things
you
never
know
where
they
take
you
does
he
leave
his
bed
oh
yes
sir
he
takes
nice
exercise
between
his
bed
and
the
window
in
the
morning
not
to
risk
a
change
of
air
and
he
quite
comfortable
in
himself
has
his
will
out
every
day
regular
it
a
great
consolation
to
well
smither
i
want
to
see
him
if
i
can
in
case
he
has
anything
to
say
to
smither
coloured
up
above
her
corsets
it
will
be
an
occasion
she
said
shall
i
take
you
round
the
house
sir
while
i
send
cook
to
break
it
to
him
no
you
go
to
him
said
soames
i
can
go
round
the
house
by
one
could
not
confess
to
sentiment
before
another
and
soames
felt
that
he
was
going
to
be
sentimental
nosing
round
those
rooms
so
saturated
with
the
past
when
smither
creaking
with
excitement
had
left
him
soames
entered
the
and
sniffed
in
his
opinion
it
mice
but
incipient
and
he
examined
the
panelling
whether
it
was
worth
a
coat
of
paint
at
timothy
age
he
was
not
sure
the
room
had
always
been
the
most
modern
in
the
house
and
only
a
faint
smile
curled
soames
lips
and
nostrils
walls
of
a
rich
green
surmounted
the
oak
dado
a
heavy
metal
chandelier
hung
by
a
chain
from
a
ceiling
divided
by
imitation
beams
the
pictures
had
been
bought
by
timothy
a
bargain
one
day
at
jobson
sixty
years
snyder
still
lifes
two
faintly
coloured
drawings
of
a
boy
and
a
girl
rather
charming
which
bore
the
initials
j
had
always
believed
they
might
turn
out
to
be
joshua
reynolds
but
soames
who
admired
them
had
discovered
that
they
were
only
john
robinson
and
a
doubtful
morland
of
a
white
pony
being
shod
plush
curtains
ten
dark
mahogany
chairs
with
plush
seats
a
turkey
carpet
and
a
mahogany
as
large
as
the
room
was
small
such
was
an
apartment
which
soames
could
remember
unchanged
in
soul
or
body
since
he
was
four
years
old
he
looked
especially
at
the
two
drawings
and
thought
shall
buy
those
at
the
sale
from
the
he
passed
into
timothy
study
he
did
not
remember
ever
having
been
in
that
room
it
was
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
volumes
and
he
looked
at
them
with
curiosity
one
wall
seemed
devoted
to
educational
books
which
timothy
firm
had
published
two
generations
as
many
as
twenty
copies
of
one
book
soames
read
their
titles
and
shuddered
the
middle
wall
had
precisely
the
same
books
as
used
to
be
in
the
library
at
his
own
father
in
park
lane
from
which
he
deduced
the
fancy
that
james
and
his
youngest
brother
had
gone
out
together
one
day
and
bought
a
brace
of
small
libraries
the
third
wall
he
approached
with
more
excitement
here
surely
timothy
own
taste
would
be
found
it
was
the
books
were
dummies
the
fourth
wall
was
all
heavily
curtained
window
and
turned
toward
it
was
a
large
chair
with
a
mahogany
attached
on
which
a
yellowish
and
folded
copy
of
the
times
dated
july
the
day
timothy
first
failed
to
come
down
as
if
in
preparation
for
the
war
seemed
waiting
for
him
still
in
a
corner
stood
a
large
globe
of
that
world
never
visited
by
timothy
deeply
convinced
of
the
unreality
of
everything
but
england
and
permanently
upset
by
the
sea
on
which
he
had
been
very
sick
one
sunday
afternoon
in
out
of
a
pleasure
boat
off
the
pier
at
brighton
with
juley
and
hester
swithin
and
hatty
chessman
all
due
to
swithin
who
was
always
taking
things
into
his
head
and
who
thank
goodness
had
been
sick
too
soames
knew
all
about
it
having
heard
the
tale
fifty
times
at
least
from
one
or
other
of
them
he
went
up
to
the
globe
and
gave
it
a
spin
it
emitted
a
faint
creak
and
moved
about
an
inch
bringing
into
his
purview
a
which
had
died
on
it
in
latitude
he
thought
was
right
and
he
went
out
and
up
the
stairs
on
the
he
stopped
before
the
case
of
stuffed
which
had
delighted
his
childhood
they
looked
not
a
day
older
suspended
on
wires
above
if
the
case
were
opened
the
birds
would
not
begin
to
hum
but
the
whole
thing
would
crumble
he
suspected
it
would
be
worth
putting
that
into
the
sale
and
suddenly
he
was
caught
by
a
memory
of
aunt
old
aunt
him
by
the
hand
in
front
of
that
case
and
saying
look
soamey
are
they
bright
and
pretty
dear
little
soames
remembered
his
own
answer
they
do
hum
he
must
have
been
six
in
a
black
velveteen
suit
with
a
remembered
that
suit
well
aunt
ann
with
her
ringlets
and
her
spidery
kind
hands
and
her
grave
old
aquiline
fine
old
lady
aunt
ann
he
moved
on
up
to
the
door
there
on
each
side
of
it
were
the
groups
of
miniatures
those
he
would
certainly
buy
in
the
miniatures
of
his
four
aunts
one
of
his
uncle
swithin
adolescent
and
one
of
his
uncle
nicholas
as
a
boy
they
had
all
been
painted
by
a
young
lady
friend
of
the
family
at
a
time
about
when
miniatures
were
considered
very
genteel
and
lasting
too
painted
as
they
were
on
ivory
many
a
time
had
he
heard
the
tale
of
that
young
lady
very
talented
my
dear
she
had
quite
a
weakness
for
swithin
and
very
soon
after
she
went
into
a
consumption
and
died
so
like
often
spoke
of
well
there
they
were
ann
juley
hester
a
small
child
swithin
with
eyes
pink
cheeks
yellow
curls
white
as
life
and
nicholas
like
cupid
with
an
eye
on
heaven
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
uncle
nick
had
always
been
rather
like
wonderful
man
to
the
last
yes
she
must
have
had
talent
and
miniatures
always
had
a
certain
cachet
of
their
own
little
subject
to
the
currents
of
competition
on
aesthetic
change
soames
opened
the
door
the
room
was
dusted
the
furniture
uncovered
the
curtains
drawn
back
precisely
as
if
his
aunts
still
dwelt
there
patiently
waiting
and
a
thought
came
to
him
when
timothy
not
would
it
not
be
almost
a
duty
to
preserve
this
put
up
a
tablet
and
show
it
specimen
of
one
shilling
with
after
all
it
was
the
completest
thing
and
perhaps
the
deadest
in
the
london
of
perfect
in
its
special
taste
and
culture
if
that
is
he
took
down
and
carried
over
to
his
own
collection
the
four
barbizon
pictures
he
had
given
them
the
still
walls
tile
green
curtains
patterned
with
red
flowers
and
ferns
the
before
the
grate
the
mahogany
cupboard
with
glass
windows
full
of
little
knickknacks
the
beaded
footstools
keats
shelley
southey
cowper
coleridge
byron
corsair
but
nothing
else
and
the
victorian
poets
in
a
bookshelf
row
the
marqueterie
cabinet
lined
with
dim
red
plush
full
of
family
relics
hester
first
fan
the
buckles
of
their
mother
father
shoes
three
bottled
scorpions
and
one
very
yellow
elephant
tusk
sent
home
from
india
by
edgar
forsyte
who
had
been
in
jute
a
yellow
bit
of
paper
propped
up
with
spidery
writing
on
it
recording
god
knew
what
and
the
pictures
crowding
on
the
save
those
four
barbizons
looking
like
the
foreigners
they
were
and
doubtful
customers
at
bright
and
illustrative
telling
the
bees
hey
for
the
ferry
and
two
in
the
style
of
frith
all
thimblerig
and
crinolines
given
them
by
swithin
oh
many
many
pictures
at
which
soames
had
gazed
a
thousand
times
in
supercilious
fascination
a
marvellous
collection
of
bright
smooth
gilt
frames
and
the
piano
beautifully
dusted
hermetically
sealed
as
ever
and
aunt
juley
album
of
pressed
seaweed
on
it
and
the
chairs
stronger
than
they
looked
and
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
the
sofa
of
crimson
silk
where
aunt
ann
and
after
her
aunt
juley
had
been
wont
to
sit
facing
the
light
and
bolt
upright
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
the
one
really
easy
chair
back
to
the
light
for
aunt
hester
soames
screwed
up
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
see
them
sitting
there
ah
and
the
now
of
too
many
stuffs
and
washed
lace
curtains
lavender
in
bags
and
dried
bees
wings
he
thought
nothing
like
it
left
it
ought
to
be
preserved
and
by
george
they
might
laugh
at
it
but
for
a
standard
of
gentle
life
never
departed
from
for
fastidiousness
of
skin
and
eye
and
nose
and
feeling
it
beat
with
its
tubes
and
cars
its
perpetual
smoking
its
girls
visible
up
to
the
knees
and
down
to
the
waist
if
you
took
the
trouble
agreeable
to
the
satyr
within
each
forsyte
but
hardly
his
idea
of
a
lady
with
their
feet
too
screwed
round
the
legs
of
their
chairs
while
they
ate
and
their
so
longs
and
their
old
beans
and
their
who
gave
him
the
shudders
whenever
he
thought
of
fleur
in
contact
with
them
and
the
capable
older
women
who
managed
life
and
gave
him
the
shudders
too
no
his
old
aunts
if
they
never
opened
their
minds
their
eyes
or
very
much
their
windows
at
least
had
manners
and
a
standard
and
reverence
for
past
and
future
with
rather
a
choky
feeling
he
closed
the
door
and
went
tiptoeing
upstairs
he
looked
in
at
a
place
on
the
way
h
in
perfect
order
of
the
eighties
with
a
sort
of
yellow
oilskin
paper
on
the
walls
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
hesitated
between
four
doors
which
of
them
was
timothy
and
he
listened
a
sound
as
of
a
child
slowly
dragging
a
about
came
to
his
ears
that
must
be
timothy
he
tapped
and
a
door
was
opened
by
smither
very
red
in
the
face
timothy
was
taking
his
walk
and
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
him
to
attend
if
soames
would
come
into
the
he
could
see
him
through
the
door
soames
went
into
the
and
stood
watching
the
last
of
the
old
forsytes
was
on
his
feet
moving
with
the
most
impressive
slowness
and
an
air
of
perfect
concentration
on
his
own
affairs
backward
and
forward
between
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
the
window
a
distance
of
some
twelve
feet
the
lower
part
of
his
square
face
no
longer
was
covered
with
snowy
beard
clipped
as
short
as
it
could
be
and
his
chin
looked
as
broad
as
his
brow
where
the
hair
was
also
quite
white
while
nose
and
cheeks
and
brow
were
a
good
yellow
one
hand
held
a
stout
stick
and
the
other
grasped
the
skirt
of
his
jaeger
from
under
which
could
be
seen
his
ankles
and
feet
thrust
into
jaeger
slippers
the
expression
on
his
face
was
that
of
a
crossed
child
intent
on
something
that
he
has
not
got
each
time
he
turned
he
stumped
the
stick
and
then
dragged
it
as
if
to
show
that
he
could
do
without
it
he
still
looks
strong
said
soames
under
his
breath
oh
yes
sir
you
should
see
him
take
his
wonderful
he
does
enjoy
it
those
quite
loud
words
gave
soames
an
insight
timothy
had
resumed
his
babyhood
does
he
take
any
interest
in
things
generally
he
said
also
loud
oh
yes
sir
his
food
and
his
will
it
quite
a
sight
to
see
him
turn
it
over
and
over
not
to
read
it
of
course
and
every
now
and
then
he
asks
the
price
of
consols
and
i
write
it
on
a
slate
for
large
of
course
i
always
write
the
same
what
they
were
when
he
last
took
notice
in
we
got
the
doctor
to
forbid
him
to
read
the
paper
when
the
war
broke
out
oh
he
did
take
on
about
that
at
first
but
he
soon
came
round
because
he
knew
it
tired
him
and
he
a
wonder
to
conserve
energy
as
he
used
to
call
it
when
my
dear
mistresses
were
alive
bless
their
hearts
how
he
did
go
on
at
them
about
that
they
were
always
so
active
if
you
remember
what
would
happen
if
i
were
to
go
in
asked
soames
would
he
remember
me
i
made
his
will
you
know
after
miss
hester
died
in
oh
that
sir
replied
smither
doubtfully
i
could
take
on
me
to
say
i
think
he
might
he
really
is
a
wonderful
man
for
his
soames
moved
into
the
doorway
and
waiting
for
timothy
to
turn
said
in
a
loud
voice
uncle
timothy
timothy
trailed
back
and
halted
eh
he
said
soames
cried
soames
at
the
top
of
his
voice
holding
out
his
hand
soames
forsyte
no
said
timothy
and
stumping
his
stick
loudly
on
the
floor
he
continued
his
walk
it
does
seem
to
work
said
soames
no
sir
replied
smither
rather
crestfallen
you
see
he
finished
his
walk
it
always
was
one
thing
at
a
time
with
him
i
expect
he
ask
me
this
afternoon
if
you
came
about
the
gas
and
a
pretty
job
i
shall
have
to
make
him
do
you
think
he
ought
to
have
a
man
about
him
smither
held
up
her
hands
a
man
oh
no
cook
and
me
can
manage
perfectly
a
strange
man
about
would
send
him
crazy
in
no
time
and
my
mistresses
would
like
the
idea
of
a
man
in
the
house
besides
of
i
suppose
the
doctor
comes
every
morning
he
makes
special
terms
for
such
a
quantity
and
timothy
so
used
he
does
take
a
bit
of
notice
except
to
put
out
his
well
said
soames
turning
away
it
rather
sad
and
painful
to
oh
sir

quite
enjoys
his
life

does
as
i
say
to
cook

more
of
a
man
than
he
ever
was
you
see
when
he
not
walkin
or
takin
his
bath
he
eatin
and
when
he
not
eatin
he
sleepin
and
there
it
is
there
is
an
ache
or
a
care
about
him
well
said
soames
there
something
in
that
i
go
down
by
the
way
let
me
see
his
i
should
have
to
take
my
time
about
that
sir
he
keeps
it
under
his
pillow
and
he
see
me
while
he
i
only
want
to
know
if
it
the
one
i
made
said
soames
you
take
a
look
at
its
date
some
time
and
let
me
yes
sir
but
i
sure
it
the
same
because
me
and
cook
witnessed
you
remember
and
there
our
names
on
it
still
and
we
only
done
it
quite
said
soames
he
did
remember
smither
and
jane
had
been
proper
witnesses
having
been
left
nothing
in
the
will
that
they
might
have
no
interest
in
timothy
death
it
had
fully
almost
improper
precaution
but
timothy
had
wished
it
and
after
all
aunt
hester
had
provided
for
them
amply
very
well
he
said
smither
look
after
him
and
if
he
should
say
anything
at
any
time
put
it
down
and
let
me
oh
yes
soames
i
be
sure
to
do
that
it
been
such
a
pleasant
change
to
see
you
cook
will
be
quite
excited
when
i
tell
soames
shook
her
hand
and
went
he
stood
for
fully
two
minutes
by
the
whereon
he
had
hung
his
hat
so
many
times
it
all
passes
he
was
thinking
and
begins
again
poor
old
chap
and
he
listened
if
perchance
the
sound
of
timothy
trailing
his
might
come
down
the
well
of
the
stairs
or
some
ghost
of
an
old
face
show
over
the
bannisters
and
an
old
voice
say
it
dear
soames
and
we
were
only
saying
that
we
had
seen
him
for
a
week
just
the
scent
of
camphor
and
in
a
sunbeam
through
the
fanlight
over
the
door
the
little
old
house
a
mausoleum
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
went
out
and
caught
his
train
native
heath
his
foot
upon
his
native
heath
his
with
some
such
feeling
did
val
dartie
in
the
fortieth
year
of
his
age
set
out
that
same
thursday
morning
very
early
from
the
old
he
had
taken
on
the
north
side
of
the
sussex
downs
his
destination
was
newmarket
and
he
had
not
been
there
since
the
autumn
of
when
he
stole
over
from
oxford
for
the
cambridgeshire
he
paused
at
the
door
to
give
his
wife
a
kiss
and
put
a
flask
of
port
into
his
pocket
do
overtire
your
leg
val
and
do
bet
too
with
the
pressure
of
her
chest
against
his
own
and
her
eyes
looking
into
his
val
felt
both
leg
and
pocket
safe
he
should
be
moderate
holly
was
always
had
a
natural
aptitude
it
did
not
seem
so
remarkable
to
him
perhaps
as
it
might
to
others
dartie
as
he
should
have
been
perfectly
faithful
to
his
young
first
cousin
during
the
twenty
years
since
he
married
her
romantically
out
in
the
boer
war
and
faithful
without
any
feeling
of
sacrifice
or
was
so
quick
so
slyly
always
a
little
in
front
of
his
mood
being
first
cousins
they
had
decided
rather
needlessly
to
have
no
children
and
though
a
little
sallower
she
had
kept
her
looks
her
slimness
and
the
colour
of
her
dark
hair
val
particularly
admired
the
life
of
her
own
she
carried
on
besides
carrying
on
his
and
riding
better
every
year
she
kept
up
her
music
she
read
an
awful
poetry
all
sorts
of
stuff
out
on
their
farm
in
cape
colony
she
had
looked
after
all
the
nigger
babies
and
women
in
a
miraculous
manner
she
was
in
fact
clever
yet
made
no
fuss
about
it
and
had
no
though
not
remarkable
for
humility
val
had
come
to
have
the
feeling
that
she
was
his
superior
and
he
did
not
grudge
great
tribute
it
might
be
noted
that
he
never
looked
at
holly
without
her
knowing
of
it
but
that
she
looked
at
him
sometimes
unawares
he
had
kissed
her
in
the
porch
because
he
should
not
be
doing
so
on
the
platform
though
she
was
going
to
the
station
with
him
to
drive
the
car
back
tanned
and
wrinkled
by
colonial
weather
and
the
wiles
inseparable
from
horses
and
handicapped
by
the
leg
which
weakened
in
the
boer
war
had
probably
saved
his
life
in
the
war
just
past
val
was
still
much
as
he
had
been
in
the
days
of
his
courtship
his
smile
as
wide
and
charming
his
eyelashes
if
anything
thicker
and
darker
his
eyes
screwed
up
under
them
as
bright
a
grey
his
freckles
rather
deeper
his
hair
a
little
grizzled
at
the
sides
he
gave
the
impression
of
one
who
has
lived
actively
with
horses
in
a
sunny
climate
twisting
the
car
sharp
round
at
the
gate
he
said
when
is
young
jon
coming
is
there
anything
you
want
for
him
i
could
bring
it
down
on
no
but
you
might
come
by
the
same
train
as
val
gave
the
ford
full
rein
he
still
drove
like
a
man
in
a
new
country
on
bad
roads
who
refuses
to
compromise
and
expects
heaven
at
every
hole
that
a
young
woman
who
knows
her
way
about
he
said
i
say
has
it
struck
you
yes
said
holly
uncle
soames
and
your
awkward
is
it
she
wo
know
and
he
wo
know
and
nothing
must
be
said
of
course
it
only
for
five
days
stable
secret
righto
if
holly
thought
it
safe
it
was
glancing
slyly
round
at
him
she
said
did
you
notice
how
beautifully
she
asked
herself
no
well
she
did
what
do
you
think
of
her
val
pretty
and
clever
but
she
might
run
out
at
any
corner
if
she
got
her
monkey
up
i
should
i
wondering
holly
murmured
whether
she
is
the
modern
young
woman
one
feels
at
sea
coming
home
into
all
you
you
get
the
hang
of
things
so
holly
slid
her
hand
into
his
you
keep
one
in
the
know
said
val
encouraged
what
do
you
think
of
that
belgian
fellow
profond
i
think
he
rather
good
devil
val
grinned
he
seems
to
me
a
queer
fish
for
a
friend
of
our
family
in
fact
our
family
is
in
pretty
queer
waters
with
uncle
soames
marrying
a
frenchwoman
and
your
dad
marrying
soames
first
our
grandfathers
would
have
had
fits
so
would
anybody
my
this
car
val
said
suddenly
wants
rousing
she
does
get
her
hind
legs
under
her
uphill
i
shall
have
to
give
her
her
head
on
the
slope
if
i
to
catch
that
there
was
that
about
horses
which
had
prevented
him
from
ever
really
sympathising
with
a
car
and
the
running
of
the
ford
under
his
guidance
compared
with
its
running
under
that
of
holly
was
always
noticeable
he
caught
the
train
take
care
going
home
she
throw
you
down
if
she
can
called
holly
and
kissed
her
hand
in
the
train
after
quarter
of
an
hour
indecision
between
thoughts
of
holly
his
morning
paper
the
look
of
the
bright
day
and
his
dim
memory
of
newmarket
val
plunged
into
the
recesses
of
a
small
square
book
all
names
pedigrees
and
notes
about
the
make
and
shape
of
horses
the
forsyte
in
him
was
bent
on
the
acquisition
of
a
certain
strain
of
blood
and
he
was
subduing
resolutely
as
yet
the
dartie
hankering
for
a
nutter
on
getting
back
to
england
after
the
profitable
sale
of
his
south
african
farm
and
stud
and
observing
that
the
sun
seldom
shone
val
had
said
to
himself
i
absolutely
got
to
have
an
interest
in
life
or
this
country
will
give
me
the
blues
not
enough
i
breed
and
i
with
just
that
extra
pinch
of
shrewdness
and
decision
imparted
by
long
residence
in
a
new
country
val
had
seen
the
weak
point
of
modern
breeding
they
were
all
hypnotised
by
fashion
and
high
price
he
should
buy
for
looks
and
let
names
go
hang
and
here
he
was
already
hypnotised
by
the
prestige
of
a
certain
strain
of
blood
he
thought
something
in
this
damned
climate
which
makes
one
go
round
in
a
ring
all
the
same
i
must
have
a
strain
of
mayfly
blood
in
this
mood
he
reached
the
mecca
of
his
hopes
it
was
one
of
those
quiet
meetings
favourable
to
such
as
wish
to
look
into
horses
rather
than
into
the
mouths
of
bookmakers
and
val
clung
to
the
paddock
his
twenty
years
of
colonial
life
divesting
him
of
the
dandyism
in
which
he
had
been
bred
had
left
him
the
essential
neatness
of
the
horseman
and
given
him
a
queer
and
rather
blighting
eye
over
what
he
called
the
silly
of
some
englishmen
the
flapping
cockatoory
of
some
had
none
of
that
and
holly
was
his
model
observant
quick
resourceful
val
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
a
transaction
a
horse
a
drink
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
heart
of
a
mayfly
filly
when
a
slow
voice
said
at
his
elbow
mr
val
dartie
how
val
dartie
she
well
i
and
he
saw
beside
him
the
belgian
he
had
met
at
his
sister
imogen
prosper
met
you
at
lunch
said
the
voice
how
are
you
murmured
val
i
very
well
replied
monsieur
profond
smiling
with
a
certain
inimitable
slowness
a
good
devil
holly
had
called
him
well
he
looked
a
little
like
a
devil
with
his
dark
clipped
pointed
beard
a
sleepy
one
though
and
with
fine
eyes
unexpectedly
intelligent
here
a
gentleman
wants
to
know
of
george
val
saw
a
large
form
and
a
face
a
little
lowering
with
sardonic
humour
bubbling
behind
a
full
grey
eye
he
remembered
it
dimly
from
old
days
when
he
would
dine
with
his
father
at
the
iseeum
club
i
used
to
go
racing
with
your
father
george
was
saying
how
the
stud
like
to
buy
one
of
my
screws
val
grinned
to
hide
the
sudden
feeling
that
the
bottom
had
fallen
out
of
breeding
they
believed
in
nothing
over
here
not
even
in
horses
george
forsyte
prosper
profond
the
devil
himself
was
not
more
disillusioned
than
those
two
did
know
you
were
a
racing
man
he
said
to
monsieur
profond
i
not
i
do
care
for
it
i
a
yachtin
man
i
do
care
for
yachtin
either
but
i
like
to
see
my
friends
i
got
some
lunch
val
dartie
just
a
small
lunch
if
you
like
to
some
not
a
small
my
thanks
said
val
very
good
of
you
i
come
along
in
about
quarter
of
an
over
there
forsyde
comin
and
monsieur
profond
poinded
with
a
finger
small
car
with
a
small
lunch
he
moved
on
groomed
sleepy
and
remote
george
forsyte
following
neat
huge
and
with
his
jesting
air
val
remained
gazing
at
the
mayfly
filly
george
forsyte
of
course
was
an
old
chap
but
this
profond
might
be
about
his
own
age
val
felt
extremely
young
as
if
the
mayfly
filly
were
a
toy
at
which
those
two
had
laughed
the
animal
had
lost
reality
that
mare
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
monsieur
what
do
you
see
in
her
must
all
die
and
george
forsyte
crony
of
his
father
racing
still
the
mayfly
it
any
better
than
any
other
he
might
just
as
well
have
a
flutter
with
his
money
instead
no
by
gum
he
muttered
suddenly
if
it
no
good
breeding
horses
it
no
good
doing
anything
what
did
i
come
for
i
buy
he
stood
back
and
watched
the
ebb
of
the
paddock
visitors
toward
the
stand
natty
old
chips
shrewd
portly
fellows
jews
trainers
looking
as
if
they
had
never
been
guilty
of
seeing
a
horse
in
their
lives
tall
flapping
languid
women
or
brisk
women
young
men
with
an
air
as
if
trying
to
take
it
or
three
of
them
with
only
one
arm
over
here
a
game
thought
val
bell
rings
horses
run
money
changes
hands
ring
again
run
again
money
changes
back
but
alarmed
at
his
own
philosophy
he
went
to
the
paddock
gate
to
watch
the
mayfly
filly
canter
down
she
moved
well
and
he
made
his
way
over
to
the
small
car
the
small
lunch
was
the
sort
a
man
dreams
of
but
seldom
gets
and
when
it
was
concluded
monsieur
profond
walked
back
with
him
to
the
paddock
your
wife
a
nice
woman
was
his
surprising
remark
nicest
woman
i
know
returned
val
dryly
yes
said
monsieur
profond
she
has
a
nice
face
i
admire
nice
val
looked
at
him
suspiciously
but
something
kindly
and
direct
in
the
heavy
diabolism
of
his
companion
disarmed
him
for
the
moment
any
time
you
like
to
come
on
my
yacht
i
give
her
a
small
thanks
said
val
in
arms
again
she
hates
the
so
do
i
said
monsieur
profond
then
why
do
you
yacht
the
belgian
eyes
smiled
oh
i
do
know
i
done
everything
the
last
thing
i
it
must
be
expensive
i
should
want
more
reason
than
monsieur
prosper
profond
raised
his
eyebrows
and
puffed
out
a
heavy
lower
lip
i
an
man
he
said
were
you
in
the
war
asked
val
i
done
that
too
i
was
gassed
it
was
a
small
bit
he
smiled
with
a
deep
and
sleepy
air
of
prosperity
as
if
he
had
caught
it
from
his
name
whether
his
saying
small
when
he
ought
to
have
said
little
was
genuine
mistake
or
affectation
val
could
not
decide
the
fellow
was
evidently
capable
of
anything
among
the
ring
of
buyers
round
the
mayfly
filly
who
had
won
her
race
monsieur
profond
said
you
goin
to
bid
val
nodded
with
this
sleepy
satan
at
his
elbow
he
felt
in
need
of
faith
though
placed
above
the
ultimate
blows
of
providence
by
the
forethought
of
a
who
had
tied
him
up
a
thousand
a
year
to
which
was
added
the
thousand
a
year
tied
up
for
holly
by
her
val
was
not
flush
of
capital
that
he
could
touch
having
spent
most
of
what
he
had
realised
from
his
south
african
farm
on
his
establishment
in
sussex
and
very
soon
he
was
thinking
it
going
beyond
me
his
exceeded
he
dropped
out
of
the
bidding
the
mayfly
filly
passed
under
the
hammer
at
seven
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
he
was
turning
away
vexed
when
the
slow
voice
of
monsieur
profond
said
in
his
ear
well
i
bought
that
small
filly
but
i
do
want
her
you
take
her
and
give
her
to
your
val
looked
at
the
fellow
with
renewed
suspicion
but
the
good
humour
in
his
eyes
was
such
that
he
really
could
not
take
offence
i
made
a
small
lot
of
money
in
the
war
began
monsieur
profond
in
answer
to
that
look
i
armament
shares
i
like
to
give
it
away
always
makin
money
i
want
very
small
lot
myself
i
like
my
friends
to
i
buy
her
of
you
at
the
price
you
gave
said
val
with
sudden
resolution
no
said
monsieur
profond
you
take
her
i
don
want
hang
it
one
why
not
smiled
monsieur
profond
i
a
friend
of
your
seven
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
is
not
a
box
of
cigars
said
val
impatiently
all
right
you
keep
her
for
me
till
i
want
her
and
do
what
you
like
with
so
long
as
she
yours
said
val
i
do
mind
that
all
right
murmured
monsieur
profond
and
moved
away
val
watched
he
might
be
a
good
devil
but
then
again
he
might
not
he
saw
him
rejoin
george
forsyte
and
thereafter
saw
him
no
more
he
spent
those
nights
after
racing
at
his
mother
house
in
green
street
winifred
dartie
at
was
marvellously
preserved
considering
the
years
during
which
she
had
put
up
with
montague
dartie
till
almost
happily
released
by
a
french
staircase
it
was
to
her
a
vehement
satisfaction
to
have
her
favourite
son
back
from
south
africa
after
all
this
time
to
feel
him
so
little
changed
and
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
his
wife
winifred
who
in
the
late
seventies
before
her
marriage
had
been
in
the
vanguard
of
freedom
pleasure
and
fashion
confessed
her
youth
outclassed
by
the
donzellas
of
the
day
they
seemed
for
instance
to
regard
marriage
as
an
incident
and
winifred
sometimes
regretted
that
she
had
not
done
the
same
a
second
third
fourth
incident
might
have
secured
her
a
partner
of
less
dazzling
inebriety
though
after
all
he
had
left
her
val
imogen
maud
benedict
almost
a
colonel
and
unharmed
by
the
war
of
whom
had
been
divorced
as
yet
the
steadiness
of
her
children
often
amazed
one
who
remembered
their
father
but
as
she
was
fond
of
believing
they
were
really
all
forsytes
favouring
herself
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
imogen
her
brother
little
girl
fleur
frankly
puzzled
winifred
the
child
was
as
restless
as
any
of
these
modern
young
she
a
small
flame
in
a
draught
prosper
profond
had
said
one
day
after
she
did
not
flap
or
talk
at
the
top
of
her
voice
the
steady
forsyteism
in
winifred
own
character
instinctively
resented
the
feeling
in
the
air
the
modern
girl
habits
and
her
motto
all
much
of
a
muchness
spend
we
shall
be
poor
she
found
it
a
saving
grace
in
fleur
that
having
set
her
heart
on
a
thing
she
had
no
change
of
heart
until
she
got
happened
after
fleur
was
of
course
too
young
to
have
made
evident
the
child
was
a
very
pretty
little
thing
too
and
quite
a
credit
to
take
about
with
her
mother
french
taste
and
gift
for
wearing
clothes
everybody
turned
to
look
at
consideration
to
winifred
a
lover
of
the
style
and
distinction
which
had
so
cruelly
deceived
her
in
the
case
of
montague
dartie
in
discussing
her
with
val
at
breakfast
on
saturday
morning
winifred
dwelt
on
the
family
skeleton
that
little
affair
of
your
and
your
aunt
irene
old
as
the
hills
of
course
fleur
need
know
nothing
about
a
fuss
your
uncle
soames
is
very
particular
about
that
so
you
be
yes
but
it
dashed
young
is
coming
to
live
with
us
while
he
learns
farming
he
there
oh
said
winifred
that
is
a
gaff
what
is
he
like
only
saw
him
robin
hill
when
we
were
home
in
he
was
naked
and
painted
blue
and
yellow
in
jolly
little
winifred
thought
that
rather
nice
and
added
comfortably
well
holly
sensible
she
know
how
to
deal
with
it
i
sha
tell
your
uncle
it
only
bother
him
it
a
great
comfort
to
have
you
back
my
dear
boy
now
that
i
getting
getting
on
why
you
as
young
as
ever
that
chap
profond
mother
is
he
all
right
prosper
profond
oh
the
most
amusing
man
i
val
grunted
and
recounted
the
story
of
the
mayfly
filly
that
so
like
him
murmured
winifred
he
does
all
sorts
of
well
said
val
shrewdly
our
family
have
been
too
lucky
with
that
kind
of
cattle
they
too
for
it
was
true
and
winifred
blue
study
lasted
a
full
minute
before
she
answered
oh
well
he
a
foreigner
val
one
must
make
all
right
i
use
his
filly
and
make
it
up
to
him
and
soon
after
he
gave
her
his
blessing
received
a
kiss
and
left
her
for
his
bookmaker
the
iseeum
club
and
victoria
station
val
dartie
after
twenty
years
of
south
africa
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
fortunately
with
something
of
her
own
for
the
object
of
her
passion
was
the
prospect
in
front
of
her
windows
the
cool
clear
light
on
the
green
downs
it
was
england
again
at
last
england
more
beautiful
than
she
had
dreamed
chance
had
in
fact
guided
the
val
darties
to
a
spot
where
the
south
downs
had
real
charm
when
the
sun
shone
holly
had
enough
of
her
father
eye
to
apprehend
the
rare
quality
of
their
outlines
and
chalky
radiance
to
go
up
there
by
the
lane
and
wander
along
toward
chanctonbury
or
amberley
was
still
a
delight
which
she
hardly
attempted
to
share
with
val
whose
admiration
of
nature
was
confused
by
a
forsyte
instinct
for
getting
something
out
of
it
such
as
the
condition
of
the
turf
for
his
exercise
driving
the
ford
home
with
a
certain
humouring
smoothness
she
promised
herself
that
the
first
use
she
would
make
of
jon
would
be
to
take
him
up
there
and
show
him
the
view
under
this
sky
she
was
looking
forward
to
her
young
with
a
motherliness
not
exhausted
by
val
a
visit
to
robin
hill
soon
after
their
arrival
home
had
yielded
no
sight
of
was
still
at
school
so
that
her
recollection
like
val
was
of
a
little
boy
striped
blue
and
yellow
down
by
the
pond
those
three
days
at
robin
hill
had
been
exciting
sad
embarrassing
memories
of
her
dead
brother
memories
of
val
courtship
the
ageing
of
her
father
not
seen
for
twenty
years
something
funereal
in
his
ironic
gentleness
which
did
not
escape
one
who
had
much
subtle
instinct
above
all
the
presence
of
her
stepmother
whom
she
could
still
vaguely
remember
as
the
lady
in
grey
of
days
when
she
was
little
and
grandfather
alive
and
mademoiselle
beauce
so
cross
because
that
intruder
gave
her
music
these
confused
and
tantalised
a
spirit
which
had
longed
to
find
robin
hill
untroubled
but
holly
was
adept
at
keeping
things
to
herself
and
all
had
seemed
to
go
quite
well
her
father
had
kissed
her
when
she
left
him
with
lips
which
she
was
sure
had
trembled
well
my
dear
he
said
the
war
has
changed
robin
hill
has
it
if
only
you
could
have
brought
jolly
back
with
you
i
say
can
you
stand
this
spiritualistic
racket
when
the
dies
it
dies
from
the
warmth
of
her
embrace
he
probably
divined
that
he
had
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
for
he
rode
off
at
once
on
irony
word
when
the
more
they
manifest
the
more
they
prove
that
they
got
hold
of
how
said
holly
why
look
at
their
photographs
of
auric
presences
you
must
have
something
material
for
light
and
shade
to
fall
on
before
you
can
take
a
photograph
no
it
end
in
our
calling
all
matter
spirit
or
all
spirit
do
know
but
do
you
believe
in
survival
dad
jolyon
had
looked
at
her
and
the
sad
whimsicality
of
his
face
impressed
her
deeply
well
my
dear
i
should
like
to
get
something
out
of
death
i
been
looking
into
it
a
bit
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
find
anything
that
telepathy
and
emanation
from
the
storehouse
of
this
world
ca
account
for
just
as
well
wish
i
could
wishes
father
thought
but
they
do
breed
holly
had
pressed
her
lips
again
to
his
forehead
with
the
feeling
that
it
confirmed
his
theory
that
all
matter
was
becoming
brow
felt
somehow
so
insubstantial
but
the
most
poignant
memory
of
that
little
visit
had
been
watching
unobserved
her
stepmother
reading
to
herself
a
letter
from
jon
it
prettiest
sight
she
had
ever
seen
irene
lost
as
it
were
in
the
letter
of
her
boy
stood
at
a
window
where
the
light
fell
on
her
face
and
her
fine
grey
hair
her
lips
were
moving
smiling
her
dark
eyes
laughing
dancing
and
the
hand
which
did
not
hold
the
letter
was
pressed
against
her
breast
holly
withdrew
as
from
a
vision
of
perfect
love
convinced
that
jon
must
be
nice
when
she
saw
him
coming
out
of
the
station
with
a
in
either
hand
she
was
confirmed
in
her
predisposition
he
was
a
little
like
jolly
that
idol
of
her
childhood
but
and
less
formal
with
deeper
eyes
and
hair
for
he
wore
no
hat
altogether
a
very
interesting
little
brother
his
tentative
politeness
charmed
one
who
was
accustomed
to
assurance
in
the
youthful
manner
he
was
disturbed
because
she
was
to
drive
him
home
instead
of
his
driving
her
should
he
have
a
shot
they
had
a
car
at
robin
hill
since
the
war
of
course
and
he
had
only
driven
once
and
landed
up
a
bank
so
she
ought
to
mind
his
trying
his
laugh
soft
and
infectious
was
very
attractive
though
that
word
she
had
heard
was
now
quite
when
they
reached
the
house
he
pulled
out
a
crumpled
letter
which
she
read
while
he
was
quite
short
letter
which
must
have
cost
her
father
many
a
pang
to
write
my
dear
you
and
val
will
not
forget
i
trust
that
jon
knows
nothing
of
family
history
his
mother
and
i
think
he
is
too
young
at
present
the
boy
is
very
dear
and
the
apple
of
her
eye
verbum
sapientibus
your
loving
father
j
that
was
all
but
it
renewed
in
holly
an
uneasy
regret
that
fleur
was
coming
after
tea
she
fulfilled
that
promise
to
herself
and
took
jon
up
the
hill
they
had
a
long
talk
sitting
above
an
old
grown
over
with
brambles
and
goosepenny
milkwort
and
liverwort
starred
the
green
slope
the
larks
sang
and
thrushes
in
the
brake
and
now
and
then
a
gull
flighting
inland
would
wheel
very
white
against
the
paling
sky
where
the
vague
moon
was
coming
up
delicious
fragrance
came
to
them
as
if
little
invisible
creatures
were
running
and
treading
scent
out
of
the
blades
of
grass
jon
who
had
fallen
silent
said
rather
suddenly
i
say
this
is
wonderful
there
no
fat
on
it
at
all
gull
flight
and
flight
and
you
a
poet
my
dear
jon
sighed
oh
golly
no
go
try
i
used
to
at
your
did
you
mother
says
too
but
i
so
rotten
have
you
any
of
yours
for
me
to
see
my
dear
holly
murmured
i
been
married
nineteen
years
i
only
wrote
verses
when
i
wanted
to
oh
said
jon
and
turned
over
on
his
face
the
one
cheek
she
could
see
was
a
charming
colour
was
jon
touched
in
the
wind
then
as
val
would
have
called
it
already
but
if
so
all
the
better
he
would
take
no
notice
of
young
fleur
besides
on
monday
he
would
begin
his
farming
and
she
smiled
was
it
burns
who
followed
the
plough
or
only
piers
plowman
nearly
every
young
man
and
most
young
women
seemed
to
be
poets
now
judging
from
the
number
of
their
books
she
had
read
out
in
south
africa
importing
them
from
hatchus
and
bumphards
and
quite
quite
much
better
than
she
had
been
herself
but
then
poetry
had
only
really
come
in
since
her
another
long
talk
after
dinner
over
a
wood
fire
in
the
low
hall
and
there
seemed
little
left
to
know
about
jon
except
anything
of
real
importance
holly
parted
from
him
at
his
bedroom
door
having
seen
twice
over
that
he
had
everything
with
the
conviction
that
she
would
love
him
and
val
would
like
him
he
was
eager
but
did
not
gush
he
was
a
splendid
listener
sympathetic
reticent
about
himself
he
evidently
loved
their
father
and
adored
his
mother
he
liked
riding
rowing
and
fencing
better
than
games
he
saved
moths
from
candles
and
could
bear
spiders
but
put
them
out
of
doors
in
screws
of
paper
sooner
than
kill
them
in
a
word
he
was
amiable
she
went
to
sleep
thinking
that
he
would
suffer
horribly
if
anybody
hurt
him
but
who
would
hurt
him
jon
on
the
other
hand
sat
awake
at
his
window
with
a
bit
of
paper
and
a
pencil
writing
his
first
real
poem
by
the
light
of
a
candle
because
there
was
not
enough
moon
to
see
by
only
enough
to
make
the
night
seem
fluttery
and
as
if
engraved
on
silver
just
the
night
for
fleur
to
walk
and
turn
her
eyes
and
lead
the
hills
and
far
away
and
jon
deeply
furrowed
in
his
ingenuous
brow
made
marks
on
the
paper
and
rubbed
them
out
and
wrote
them
in
again
and
did
all
that
was
necessary
for
the
completion
of
a
work
of
art
and
he
had
a
feeling
such
as
the
winds
of
spring
must
have
trying
their
first
songs
among
the
coming
blossom
jon
was
one
of
those
boys
not
many
in
whom
a
love
of
beauty
had
survived
school
life
he
had
had
to
keep
it
to
himself
of
course
so
that
not
even
the
knew
of
it
but
it
was
there
fastidious
and
clear
within
him
and
his
poem
seemed
to
him
as
lame
and
stilted
as
the
night
was
winged
but
he
kept
it
all
the
same
it
was
a
beast
but
better
than
nothing
as
an
expression
of
the
inexpressible
and
he
thought
with
a
sort
of
discomfiture
sha
be
able
to
show
it
to
mother
he
slept
terribly
well
when
he
did
sleep
overwhelmed
by
novelty
to
avoid
the
awkwardness
of
questions
which
could
not
be
answered
all
that
had
been
told
jon
was
there
a
girl
coming
down
with
val
for
the
for
the
same
reason
all
that
had
been
told
fleur
was
we
got
a
youngster
staying
with
the
two
yearlings
as
val
called
them
in
his
thoughts
met
therefore
in
a
manner
which
for
unpreparedness
left
nothing
to
be
desired
they
were
thus
introduced
by
holly
this
is
jon
my
little
brother
fleur
a
cousin
of
ours
jon
who
was
coming
in
through
a
french
window
out
of
strong
sunlight
was
so
confounded
by
the
providential
nature
of
this
miracle
that
he
had
time
to
hear
fleur
say
calmly
oh
how
do
you
do
as
if
he
had
never
seen
her
and
to
understand
dimly
from
the
quickest
imaginable
little
movement
of
her
head
that
he
never
had
seen
her
he
bowed
therefore
over
her
hand
in
an
intoxicated
manner
and
became
more
silent
than
the
grave
he
knew
better
than
to
speak
once
in
his
early
life
surprised
reading
by
a
nightlight
he
had
said
fatuously
i
was
just
turning
over
the
leaves
mum
and
his
mother
had
replied
jon
never
tell
stories
because
of
your
face
nobody
will
ever
believe
the
saying
had
permanently
undermined
the
confidence
necessary
to
the
success
of
spoken
untruth
he
listened
therefore
to
fleur
swift
and
rapt
allusions
to
the
jolliness
of
everything
plied
her
with
scones
and
jam
and
got
away
as
soon
as
might
be
they
say
that
in
delirium
tremens
you
see
a
fixed
object
preferably
dark
which
suddenly
changes
shape
and
position
jon
saw
the
fixed
object
it
had
dark
eyes
and
passably
dark
hair
and
changed
its
position
but
never
its
shape
the
knowledge
that
between
him
and
that
object
there
was
already
a
secret
understanding
however
impossible
to
understand
thrilled
him
so
that
he
waited
feverishly
and
began
to
copy
out
his
of
course
he
would
never
dare
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
roused
him
and
leaning
from
his
window
he
saw
her
riding
forth
with
val
it
was
clear
that
she
wasted
no
time
but
the
sight
filled
him
with
grief
he
wasted
his
if
he
had
not
bolted
in
his
fearful
ecstasy
he
might
have
been
asked
to
go
too
and
from
his
window
he
sat
and
watched
them
disappear
appear
again
in
the
chine
of
the
road
vanish
and
emerge
once
more
for
a
minute
clear
on
the
outline
of
the
down
brute
he
thought
always
miss
my
chances
why
could
he
be
and
ready
and
leaning
his
chin
on
his
hands
he
imagined
the
ride
he
might
have
had
with
her
a
was
but
a
and
he
had
missed
three
hours
of
it
did
he
know
any
one
except
himself
who
would
have
been
such
a
flat
he
did
not
he
dressed
for
dinner
early
and
was
first
down
he
would
miss
no
more
but
he
missed
fleur
who
came
down
last
he
sat
opposite
her
at
dinner
and
it
was
to
say
anything
for
fear
of
saying
the
wrong
thing
impossible
to
keep
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
in
the
only
natural
way
in
sum
impossible
to
treat
normally
one
with
whom
in
fancy
he
had
already
been
over
the
hills
and
far
away
conscious
too
all
the
time
that
he
must
seem
to
her
to
all
of
them
a
dumb
gawk
yes
it
was
terrible
and
she
was
talking
so
with
swift
wing
this
way
and
that
wonderful
how
she
had
learned
an
art
which
he
found
so
disgustingly
difficult
she
must
think
him
hopeless
indeed
his
sister
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
certain
astonishment
obliged
him
at
last
to
look
at
fleur
but
instantly
her
eyes
very
wide
and
eager
seeming
to
say
oh
for
goodness
sake
obliged
him
to
look
at
val
where
a
grin
obliged
him
to
look
at
his
at
least
had
no
eyes
and
no
grin
and
he
ate
it
hastily
jon
is
going
to
be
a
farmer
he
heard
holly
say
a
farmer
and
a
he
glanced
up
reproachfully
caught
the
comic
lift
of
her
eyebrow
just
like
their
father
laughed
and
felt
better
val
recounted
the
incident
of
monsieur
prosper
profond
nothing
could
have
been
more
favourable
for
in
relating
it
he
regarded
holly
who
in
turn
regarded
him
while
fleur
seemed
to
be
regarding
with
a
slight
frown
some
thought
of
her
own
and
jon
was
really
free
to
look
at
her
at
last
she
had
on
a
white
frock
very
simple
and
well
made
her
arms
were
bare
and
her
hair
had
a
white
rose
in
it
in
just
that
swift
moment
of
free
vision
after
such
intense
discomfort
jon
saw
her
sublimated
as
one
sees
in
the
dark
a
slender
white
caught
her
like
a
verse
of
poetry
flashed
before
the
eyes
of
the
mind
or
a
tune
which
floats
out
in
the
distance
and
dies
he
wondered
giddily
how
old
she
seemed
so
much
more
and
experienced
than
himself
why
must
he
say
they
had
met
he
remembered
suddenly
his
mother
face
puzzled
when
she
answered
yes
they
relations
but
we
do
know
impossible
that
his
mother
who
loved
beauty
should
not
admire
fleur
if
she
did
know
her
alone
with
val
after
dinner
he
sipped
port
deferentially
and
answered
the
advances
of
this
as
to
riding
always
the
first
consideration
with
val
he
could
have
the
young
chestnut
saddle
and
unsaddle
it
himself
and
generally
look
after
it
when
he
brought
it
in
jon
said
he
was
accustomed
to
all
that
at
home
and
saw
that
he
had
gone
up
one
in
his
host
estimation
fleur
said
val
ca
ride
much
yet
but
she
keen
of
course
her
father
does
know
a
horse
from
a
does
your
dad
ride
he
used
to
but
now
know
he
stopped
so
hating
the
word
his
father
was
old
and
yet
not
old
quite
muttered
val
i
used
to
know
your
brother
up
at
oxford
ages
ago
the
one
who
died
in
the
boer
war
we
had
a
fight
in
new
college
gardens
that
was
a
queer
business
he
added
musing
a
good
deal
came
out
of
jon
eyes
opened
wide
all
was
pushing
him
toward
historical
research
when
his
sister
voice
said
gently
from
the
doorway
come
along
you
two
and
he
rose
his
heart
pushing
him
toward
something
far
more
modern
fleur
having
declared
that
it
was
simply
too
wonderful
to
stay
indoors
they
all
went
out
moonlight
was
frosting
the
dew
and
an
old
sundial
threw
a
long
shadow
two
box
hedges
at
right
angles
dark
and
square
barred
off
the
orchard
fleur
turned
through
that
angled
opening
come
on
she
called
jon
glanced
at
the
others
and
followed
she
was
running
among
the
trees
like
a
ghost
all
was
lovely
and
foamlike
above
her
and
there
was
a
scent
of
old
trunks
and
of
nettles
she
vanished
he
thought
he
had
lost
her
then
almost
ran
into
her
standing
quite
still
is
it
jolly
she
cried
and
jon
answered
rather
she
reached
up
twisted
off
a
blossom
and
twirling
it
in
her
fingers
said
i
suppose
i
can
call
you
jon
i
should
think
so
all
right
but
you
know
there
a
feud
between
our
families
jon
stammered
feud
why
it
ever
so
romantic
and
silly
that
why
i
pretended
we
met
shall
we
get
up
early
morning
and
go
for
a
walk
before
breakfast
and
have
it
out
i
hate
being
slow
about
things
do
you
jon
murmured
a
rapturous
assent
six
then
i
think
your
mother
beautiful
jon
said
fervently
yes
she
i
love
all
kinds
of
beauty
went
on
fleur
when
it
exciting
i
do
like
greek
things
a
what
not
euripides
euripides
oh
no
i
ca
bear
greek
plays
they
so
long
i
think
beauty
always
swift
i
like
to
look
at
one
picture
for
instance
and
then
run
off
i
ca
bear
a
lot
of
things
together
look
she
held
up
her
blossom
in
the
moonlight
that
better
than
all
the
orchard
i
and
suddenly
with
her
other
hand
she
caught
jon
of
all
things
in
the
world
do
you
think
caution
the
most
awful
smell
the
moonlight
she
thrust
the
blossom
against
his
face
jon
agreed
giddily
that
of
all
things
in
the
world
caution
was
the
worst
and
bending
over
kissed
the
hand
which
held
his
that
nice
and
said
fleur
calmly
you
frightfully
silent
jon
still
i
like
silence
when
it
she
let
go
his
hand
did
you
think
i
dropped
my
handkerchief
on
purpose
no
cried
jon
intensely
shocked
well
i
did
of
course
let
get
back
or
they
think
we
doing
this
on
purpose
and
again
she
ran
like
a
ghost
among
the
trees
jon
followed
with
love
in
his
heart
spring
in
his
heart
and
over
all
the
moonlit
white
unearthly
blossom
they
came
out
where
they
had
gone
in
fleur
walking
demurely
it
quite
wonderful
in
there
she
said
dreamily
to
holly
jon
preserved
silence
hoping
against
hope
that
she
might
be
thinking
it
swift
she
bade
him
a
casual
and
demure
which
made
him
think
he
had
been
dreaming
in
her
bedroom
fleur
had
flung
off
her
gown
and
wrapped
in
a
shapeless
garment
with
the
white
flower
still
in
her
hair
she
looked
like
a
mousme
sitting
on
her
bed
writing
by
candlelight
dearest
cherry
i
believe
i
in
love
i
got
it
in
the
neck
only
the
feeling
is
really
lower
down
he
a
second
a
child
about
six
months
older
and
ten
years
younger
than
i
am
boys
always
fall
in
love
with
their
seniors
and
girls
with
their
juniors
or
with
old
men
of
forty
do
laugh
but
his
eyes
are
the
truest
things
i
ever
saw
and
quite
divinely
silent
we
had
a
most
romantic
first
meeting
in
london
under
the
vospovitch
juno
and
now
he
sleeping
in
the
next
room
and
the
moonlight
on
the
blossom
and
morning
before
awake
we
going
to
walk
off
into
down
fairyland
there
a
feud
between
our
families
which
makes
it
really
exciting
yes
and
i
may
have
to
use
subterfuge
and
come
on
you
for
so
know
why
my
father
does
want
us
to
know
each
other
but
i
ca
help
that
life
too
short
he
got
the
most
beautiful
mother
with
lovely
silvery
hair
and
a
young
face
with
dark
eyes
i
staying
with
his
married
my
cousin
it
all
mixed
up
but
i
mean
to
pump
her
we
often
talked
about
love
being
a
well
that
all
tosh
it
the
beginning
of
sport
and
the
sooner
you
feel
it
my
dear
the
better
for
you
jon
not
simplified
spelling
but
short
for
jolyon
which
is
a
name
in
my
family
they
say
is
the
sort
that
lights
up
and
goes
out
about
five
feet
ten
still
growing
and
i
believe
he
going
to
be
a
poet
if
you
laugh
at
me
i
done
with
you
forever
i
perceive
all
sorts
of
difficulties
but
you
know
when
i
really
want
a
thing
i
get
it
one
of
the
chief
effects
of
love
is
that
you
see
the
air
sort
of
inhabited
like
seeing
a
face
in
the
moon
and
you
feel
dancey
and
soft
at
the
same
time
with
a
funny
a
continual
first
sniff
of
above
your
stays
this
is
my
first
and
i
feel
as
if
it
were
going
to
be
my
last
which
is
absurd
of
course
by
all
the
laws
of
nature
and
morality
if
you
mock
me
i
will
smite
you
and
if
you
tell
anybody
i
will
never
forgive
you
so
much
so
that
i
almost
do
think
i
send
this
letter
anyway
i
sleep
over
it
so
my
your
on
grass
when
those
two
young
forsytes
emerged
from
the
chine
lane
and
set
their
faces
east
toward
the
sun
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
heaven
and
the
downs
were
dewy
they
had
come
at
a
good
bat
up
the
slope
and
were
a
little
out
of
breath
if
they
had
anything
to
say
they
did
not
say
it
but
marched
in
the
early
awkwardness
of
unbreakfasted
morning
under
the
songs
of
the
larks
the
stealing
out
had
been
fun
but
with
the
freedom
of
the
tops
the
sense
of
conspiracy
ceased
and
gave
place
to
dumbness
we
made
one
blooming
error
said
fleur
when
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
i
jon
produced
a
stick
of
chocolate
they
shared
it
and
their
tongues
were
loosened
they
discussed
the
nature
of
their
homes
and
previous
existences
which
had
a
kind
of
fascinating
unreality
up
on
that
lonely
height
there
remained
but
one
thing
solid
in
jon
mother
but
one
thing
solid
in
father
and
of
these
figures
as
though
seen
in
the
distance
with
disapproving
faces
they
spoke
little
the
down
dipped
and
rose
again
toward
chanctonbury
ring
a
sparkle
of
far
sea
came
into
view
a
hovered
in
the
sun
eye
so
that
the
brown
of
his
wings
gleamed
nearly
red
jon
had
a
passion
for
birds
and
an
aptitude
for
sitting
very
still
to
watch
them
and
with
a
memory
for
what
interested
him
on
birds
he
was
almost
worth
listening
to
but
in
chanctonbury
ring
there
were
great
beech
temple
was
empty
of
life
and
almost
chilly
at
this
early
hour
they
came
out
willingly
again
into
the
sun
on
the
far
side
it
was
fleur
turn
now
she
spoke
of
dogs
and
the
way
people
treated
them
it
was
wicked
to
keep
them
on
chains
she
would
like
to
flog
people
who
did
that
jon
was
astonished
to
find
her
so
humanitarian
she
knew
a
dog
it
seemed
which
some
farmer
near
her
home
kept
chained
up
at
the
end
of
his
chicken
run
in
all
weathers
till
it
had
almost
lost
its
voice
from
barking
and
the
misery
is
she
said
vehemently
that
if
the
poor
thing
bark
at
every
one
who
passes
it
would
be
kept
there
i
do
think
men
are
cunning
brutes
i
let
it
go
twice
on
the
sly
it
nearly
bitten
me
both
times
and
then
it
goes
simply
mad
with
joy
but
it
always
runs
back
home
at
last
and
they
chain
it
up
again
if
i
had
my
way
chain
that
man
jon
saw
her
teeth
and
her
eyes
gleam
i
brand
him
on
his
forehead
with
the
word
that
would
teach
him
jon
agreed
that
it
would
be
a
good
remedy
it
their
sense
of
property
he
said
which
makes
people
chain
things
the
last
generation
thought
of
nothing
but
property
and
why
there
was
the
oh
said
fleur
i
never
thought
of
that
your
people
and
mine
quarrelled
about
property
and
anyway
we
all
got
least
i
suppose
your
people
oh
yes
luckily
i
do
suppose
i
shall
be
any
good
at
making
if
you
were
i
do
believe
i
should
like
jon
slipped
his
hand
tremulously
under
her
arm
fleur
looked
straight
before
her
and
chanted
jon
jon
the
farmer
son
stole
a
pig
and
away
he
run
jon
arm
crept
round
her
waist
this
is
rather
sudden
said
fleur
calmly
do
you
often
do
it
jon
dropped
his
arm
but
when
she
laughed
his
arm
stole
back
again
and
fleur
began
to
sing
o
who
will
oer
the
downs
so
free
o
who
will
with
me
ride
o
who
will
up
and
follow
sing
jon
jon
sang
the
larks
joined
in
and
an
early
morning
church
far
away
over
in
steyning
they
went
on
from
tune
to
tune
till
fleur
said
my
god
i
am
hungry
now
oh
i
am
sorry
she
looked
round
into
his
face
jon
you
rather
a
and
she
pressed
his
hand
against
her
waist
jon
almost
reeled
from
happiness
a
dog
coursing
a
hare
startled
them
apart
they
watched
the
two
vanish
down
the
slope
till
fleur
said
with
a
sigh
he
never
catch
it
thank
goodness
what
the
time
mine
stopped
i
never
wound
jon
looked
at
his
watch
by
jove
he
said
mine
stopped
they
walked
on
again
but
only
hand
in
hand
if
the
grass
is
dry
said
fleur
let
sit
down
for
half
a
jon
took
off
his
coat
and
they
shared
it
smell
actually
wild
thyme
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
again
they
sat
some
minutes
in
silence
we
are
goats
cried
fleur
jumping
up
we
shall
be
most
fearfully
late
and
look
so
silly
and
put
them
on
their
guard
look
here
jon
we
only
came
out
to
get
an
appetite
for
breakfast
and
lost
our
way
see
yes
said
jon
it
serious
there
be
a
stopper
put
on
us

you
a
good
liar
i
believe
not
very
but
i
can
fleur
frowned

realize
that

do
mean

to
be
why

i
told
you
but
that

only
child
and
so
are
your
mother

it
a
bore
there
so
much
expected
of

by
the
time
they
done
expecting
one
as
good
as
yes
muttered
jon
life
beastly
short
one
wants
to
live
forever
and
know
and
love

cried
jon
i
only
want
to
love
indeed
you
coming
on
oh
look
there
the
we
ca
be
very
far
now
let
jon
followed
wondering
fearfully
if
he
had
offended
her
the
was
full
of
sunshine
and
the
murmuration
of
bees
fleur
flung
back
her
hair
well
she
said
in
case
of
accidents
you
may
give
me
one
kiss
jon
and
she
pushed
her
cheek
forward
with
ecstasy
he
kissed
that
hot
soft
cheek
now
remember
we
lost
our
way
and
leave
it
to
me
as
much
as
you
can
i
going
to
be
rather
beastly
to
you
it
safer
try
and
be
beastly
to
me
jon
shook
his
head
that
just
to
please
me
till
five
at
all
anybody
will
be
able
to
see
through
it
said
jon
gloomily

best

are
wave
your
hat
oh
you

got
one
well
i
cooee
get
a
little
away
from
me
and
look
five
minutes
later
entering
the
house
and
doing
his
utmost
to
look
sulky
jon
heard
her
clear
voice
in
the
oh
i
simply
ravenous
he
going
to
be
a
he
loses
his
way
the
boy
an
idiot
ix
goya

her
cousins

cardigans
and
this
fellow
profond
and
everything
flat
as
a
pancake
for
the
want
of
her
he
stood
before
his
point
of
his
collection
he
had
bought
the
ugly
great
thing
with
two
early
matisses
before
the
war
because
there
was
such
a
fuss
about
those
chaps
he
was
wondering
whether
profond
would
take
them
off
his
fellow
seemed
not
to
know
what
to
do
with
his
he
heard
his
sister
voice

horrid
thing

if
they
are
soames
uttered
a
glum
laugh
you
did
come
up
to
tell
me
no
do
you
know
that
jolyon
boy
is
staying
with
val
and
his
wife
soames
spun
round
what
yes
drawled
winifred
he
gone
to
live
with
them
there
while
he
learns
soames
had
turned
away
but
her
voice
pursued
him
as
he
walked
up
and
down
i
warned
val
that
neither
of
them
was
to
be
spoken
to
about
old
why
did
you
tell
me
before
winifred
shrugged
her
substantial
shoulders
fleur
does
what
she
likes
you
always
spoiled
her
besides
my
dear
boy
what
the
harm
the
harm
muttered
soames
why
he
checked
himself
the
juno
the
handkerchief
fleur
eyes
her
questions
and
now
this
delay
in
her
symptoms
seemed
to
him
so
sinister
that
faithful
to
his
nature
he
could
not
part
with
them
i
think
you
take
too
much
care
said
winifred
if
i
were
you
i
should
tell
her
of
that
old
matter
it
no
good
thinking
that
girls
in
these
days
are
as
they
used
to
be
where
they
pick
up
their
knowledge
i
ca
tell
but
they
seem
to
know
over
soames
face
closely
composed
passed
a
sort
of
spasm
and
winifred
added
hastily
if
you
do
like
to
speak
of
it
i
could
for
soames
shook
his
head
unless
there
was
absolute
necessity
the
thought
that
his
adored
daughter
should
learn
of
that
old
scandal
hurt
his
pride
too
much
no
he
said
not
yet
never
if
i
can
help
it
nonsense
my
dear
think
what
people
are
twenty
years
is
a
long
time
muttered
soames
outside
our
family
who
likely
to
remember
winifred
was
silenced
she
inclined
more
and
more
to
that
peace
and
quietness
of
which
montague
dartie
had
deprived
her
in
her
youth
and
since
pictures
always
depressed
her
she
soon
went
down
again
soames
passed
into
the
corner
where
side
by
side
hung
his
real
goya
and
the
copy
of
the
fresco
la
his
acquisition
of
the
real
goya
rather
beautifully
illustrated
the
cobweb
of
vested
interests
and
passions
which
mesh
the
fly
of
human
life
the
real
goya
noble
owner
ancestor
had
come
into
possession
of
it
during
some
spanish
was
in
a
word
loot
the
noble
owner
had
remained
in
ignorance
of
its
value
until
in
the
nineties
an
enterprising
critic
discovered
that
a
spanish
painter
named
goya
was
a
genius
it
was
only
a
fair
goya
but
almost
unique
in
england
and
the
noble
owner
became
a
marked
man
having
many
possessions
and
that
aristocratic
culture
which
independent
of
mere
sensuous
enjoyment
is
founded
on
the
sounder
principle
that
one
must
know
everything
and
be
fearfully
interested
in
life
he
had
fully
intended
to
keep
an
article
which
contributed
to
his
reputation
while
he
was
alive
and
to
leave
it
to
the
nation
after
he
was
dead
fortunately
for
soames
the
house
of
lords
was
violently
attacked
in
and
the
noble
owner
became
alarmed
and
angry
he
said
to
himself
think
they
can
have
it
both
ways
they
are
very
much
mistaken
so
long
as
they
leave
me
in
quiet
enjoyment
the
nation
can
have
some
of
my
pictures
at
my
death
but
if
the
nation
is
going
to
bait
me
and
rob
me
like
this
i
damned
if
i
wo
sell
the
lot
they
ca
have
my
private
property
and
my
public
he
brooded
in
this
fashion
for
several
months
till
one
morning
after
reading
the
speech
of
a
certain
statesman
he
telegraphed
to
his
agent
to
come
down
and
bring
bodkin
on
going
over
the
collection
bodkin
than
whose
opinion
on
market
values
none
was
more
sought
pronounced
that
with
a
free
hand
to
sell
to
america
germany
and
other
places
where
there
was
an
interest
in
art
a
lot
more
money
could
be
made
than
by
selling
in
england
the
noble
owner
public
well
known
but
the
pictures
were
unique
the
noble
owner
put
this
opinion
in
his
pipe
and
smoked
it
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
read
another
speech
by
the
same
statesman
and
telegraphed
to
his
agents
give
bodkin
a
free
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
bodkin
conceived
the
idea
which
saved
the
goya
and
two
other
unique
pictures
for
the
native
country
of
the
noble
owner
with
one
hand
bodkin
proffered
the
pictures
to
the
foreign
market
with
the
other
he
formed
a
list
of
private
british
collectors
having
obtained
what
he
considered
the
highest
possible
bids
from
across
the
seas
he
submitted
pictures
and
bids
to
the
private
british
collectors
and
invited
them
of
their
public
spirit
to
outbid
in
three
instances
including
the
goya
out
of
he
was
successful
and
why
one
of
the
private
collectors
made
had
made
so
many
that
he
desired
that
his
wife
should
be
called
lady
he
therefore
bought
a
unique
picture
at
great
cost
and
gave
it
to
the
nation
it
was
part
his
friends
said
of
his
general
the
second
of
the
private
collectors
was
an
americophobe
and
bought
an
unique
picture
to
spite
the
damned
the
third
of
the
private
collectors
was
soames
sober
than
either
of
the
after
a
visit
to
madrid
because
he
was
certain
that
goya
was
still
on
the
up
grade
goya
was
not
booming
at
the
moment
but
he
would
come
again
and
looking
at
that
portrait
hogarthian
manetesque
in
its
directness
but
with
its
own
queer
sharp
beauty
of
paint
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
still
that
he
had
made
no
error
heavy
though
the
price
had
he
had
ever
paid
and
next
to
it
was
hanging
the
copy
of
la
there
she
little
back
at
him
in
her
dreamy
mood
the
mood
he
loved
best
because
he
felt
so
much
safer
when
she
looked
like
that
he
was
still
gazing
when
the
scent
of
a
cigar
impinged
on
his
nostrils
and
a
voice
said
well
forsyde
what
you
goin
to
do
with
this
small
lot
that
belgian
chap
whose
if
flemish
blood
were
not
been
armenian
subduing
a
natural
irritation
he
said
are
you
a
judge
of
pictures
well
i
got
a
few
any
i
rather
like
what
do
you
think
of
this
said
soames
pointing
to
the
gauguin
monsieur
profond
protruded
his
lower
lip
and
short
pointed
beard
rather
fine
i
think
he
said
do
you
want
to
sell
it
soames
checked
his
instinctive
not
particularly
would
not
chaffer
with
this
alien
yes
he
said
what
do
you
want
for
it
what
i
all
right
said
monsieur
profond
i
be
glad
to
take
that
small
picture
awful
dead
but
they
amusin
i
don
care
for
pictures
much
but
i
got
some
just
a
small
what
do
you
care
for
monsieur
profond
shrugged
his
shoulders
life
awful
like
a
lot
of
monkeys
scramblin
for
empty
you
young
said
soames
if
the
fellow
must
make
a
generalization
he
need
suggest
that
the
forms
of
property
lacked
solidity
i
don
worry
replied
monsieur
profond
smiling
we
born
and
we
die
half
the
world
starvin
i
feed
a
small
lot
of
babies
out
in
my
mother
country
but
what
the
use
might
as
well
throw
my
money
in
the
soames
looked
at
him
and
turned
back
toward
his
goya
he
did
know
what
the
fellow
wanted
what
shall
i
make
my
cheque
for
pursued
monsieur
profond
five
hundred
said
soames
shortly
but
i
do
want
you
to
take
it
if
you
do
care
for
it
more
than
that
all
right
said
monsieur
profond
i
be
to
that
he
wrote
a
cheque
with
a
heavily
chased
with
gold
soames
watched
the
process
uneasily
how
on
earth
had
the
fellow
known
that
he
wanted
to
sell
that
picture
monsieur
profond
held
out
the
cheque
the
english
are
awful
funny
about
pictures
he
said
so
are
the
french
so
are
my
people
they
all
awful
i
do
understand
you
said
soames
stiffly
it
like
hats
said
monsieur
profond
enigmatically
small
or
large
turnin
up
or
the
fashion
awful
and
smiling
he
drifted
out
of
the
gallery
again
blue
and
solid
like
the
smoke
of
his
excellent
cigar
soames
had
taken
the
cheque
feeling
as
if
the
intrinsic
value
of
ownership
had
been
called
in
question
a
cosmopolitan
he
thought
watching
profond
emerge
from
under
the
verandah
with
annette
and
saunter
down
the
lawn
toward
the
river
what
his
wife
saw
in
the
fellow
he
did
know
unless
it
was
that
he
could
speak
her
language
and
there
passed
in
soames
what
monsieur
profond
would
have
called
a
small
doubt
whether
annette
was
not
too
handsome
to
be
walking
with
any
one
so
even
at
that
distance
he
could
see
the
blue
fumes
from
profond
cigar
wreath
out
in
the
quiet
sunlight
and
his
grey
buckskin
shoes
and
his
grey
fellow
was
a
dandy
and
he
could
see
the
quick
turn
of
his
wife
head
so
very
straight
on
her
desirable
neck
and
shoulders
that
turn
of
her
neck
always
seemed
to
him
a
little
too
showy
and
in
the
queen
of
all
i
survey
quite
distinguished
he
watched
them
walk
along
the
path
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
a
young
man
in
flannels
joined
them
down
sunday
caller
no
doubt
from
up
the
river
he
went
back
to
his
goya
he
was
still
staring
at
that
replica
of
fleur
and
worrying
over
winifred
news
when
his
wife
voice
said
mr
michael
mont
soames
you
invited
him
to
see
your
there
was
the
cheerful
young
man
of
the
gallery
off
cork
street
turned
up
you
see
sir
i
live
only
four
miles
from
pangbourne
jolly
day
is
it
confronted
with
the
results
of
his
expansiveness
soames
scrutinized
his
visitor
the
young
man
mouth
was
excessively
large
and
seemed
always
grinning
why
did
he
grow
the
rest
of
those
idiotic
little
moustaches
which
made
him
look
like
a
buffoon
what
on
earth
were
young
men
about
deliberately
lowering
their
class
with
these
or
little
slug
whiskers
ugh
affected
young
idiots
in
other
respects
he
was
presentable
and
his
flannels
very
clean
happy
to
see
you
he
said
the
young
man
who
had
been
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
became
transfixed
i
say
he
said
picture
soames
saw
with
mixed
sensations
that
he
had
addressed
the
remark
to
the
goya
copy
yes
he
said
dryly
that
not
a
goya
it
a
copy
i
had
it
painted
because
it
reminded
me
of
my
by
jove
i
thought
i
knew
the
face
sir
is
she
here
the
frankness
of
his
interest
almost
disarmed
soames
she
be
in
after
tea
he
said
shall
we
go
round
the
pictures
and
soames
began
that
round
which
never
tired
him
he
had
not
anticipated
much
intelligence
from
one
who
had
mistaken
a
copy
for
an
original
but
as
they
passed
from
section
to
section
period
to
period
he
was
startled
by
the
young
man
frank
and
relevant
remarks
natively
shrewd
himself
and
even
sensuous
beneath
his
mask
soames
had
not
spent
years
over
his
one
hobby
without
knowing
something
more
about
pictures
than
their
market
values
he
was
as
it
were
the
missing
link
between
the
artist
and
the
commercial
public
art
for
art
sake
and
all
that
of
course
was
cant
but
aesthetics
and
good
taste
were
necessary
the
appreciation
of
enough
persons
of
good
taste
was
what
gave
a
work
of
art
its
permanent
market
value
or
in
other
words
made
it
a
work
of
there
was
no
real
cleavage
and
he
was
sufficiently
accustomed
to
and
unseeing
visitors
to
be
intrigued
by
one
who
did
not
hesitate
to
say
of
mauve
good
old
haystacks
or
of
james
maris
did
he
just
paint
and
paper
mathew
was
the
real
swell
sir
you
could
dig
into
his
surfaces
it
was
after
the
young
man
had
whistled
before
a
whistler
with
the
words
think
he
ever
really
saw
a
naked
woman
sir
that
soames
remarked
what
are
you
mont
if
i
may
ask
i
sir
i
was
going
to
be
a
painter
but
the
war
knocked
that
then
in
the
trenches
you
know
i
used
to
dream
of
the
stock
exchange
snug
and
warm
and
just
noisy
enough
but
the
peace
knocked
that
shares
seem
off
do
they
i
only
been
demobbed
about
a
year
what
do
you
recommend
sir
have
you
got
money
well
answered
the
young
man
i
got
a
father
i
kept
him
alive
during
the
war
so
he
bound
to
keep
me
alive
now
though
of
course
there
the
question
whether
he
ought
to
be
allowed
to
hang
on
to
his
property
what
do
you
think
about
that
sir
soames
pale
and
defensive
smiled
the
old
man
has
fits
when
i
tell
him
he
may
have
to
work
yet
he
got
land
you
know
it
a
fatal
this
is
my
real
goya
said
soames
dryly
by
george
he
was
a
swell
i
saw
a
goya
in
munich
once
that
bowled
me
middle
stump
a
most
old
woman
in
the
most
gorgeous
lace
he
made
no
compromise
with
the
public
taste
that
old
boy
was
explosive
he
must
have
smashed
up
a
lot
of
convention
in
his
day
could
he
just
paint
he
makes
velasquez
stiff
do
you
think
i
have
no
velasquez
said
soames
the
young
man
stared
no
he
said
only
nations
or
profiteers
can
afford
him
i
suppose
i
say
why
should
all
the
bankrupt
nations
sell
their
velasquez
and
titians
and
other
swells
to
the
profiteers
by
force
and
then
pass
a
law
that
any
one
who
holds
a
picture
by
an
old
hang
it
in
a
public
gallery
there
seems
something
in
shall
we
go
down
to
tea
said
soames
the
young
man
ears
seemed
to
droop
on
his
skull
not
dense
thought
soames
following
him
off
the
premises
goya
with
his
satiric
and
surpassing
precision
his
original
line
and
the
daring
of
his
light
and
shade
could
have
reproduced
to
admiration
the
group
assembled
round
annette
in
the
inglenook
below
he
alone
perhaps
of
painters
would
have
done
justice
to
the
sunlight
filtering
through
a
screen
of
creeper
to
the
lovely
pallor
of
brass
the
old
cut
glasses
the
thin
slices
of
lemon
in
pale
amber
tea
justice
to
annette
in
her
black
lacey
dress
there
was
something
of
the
fair
spaniard
in
her
beauty
though
it
lacked
the
spirituality
of
that
rare
type
to
winifred
corseted
solidity
to
soames
of
a
certain
grey
and
distinction
to
the
vivacious
michael
mont
pointed
in
ear
and
eye
to
imogen
dark
luscious
of
glance
growing
a
little
stout
to
prosper
profond
with
his
expression
as
who
should
say
well
goya
what
the
use
of
paintin
this
small
party
finally
to
jack
cardigan
with
his
shining
stare
and
tanned
sanguinity
betraying
the
moving
principle
i
english
and
i
live
to
be
curious
by
the
way
that
imogen
who
as
a
girl
had
declared
solemnly
one
day
at
timothy
that
she
would
never
marry
a
good
were
so
have
married
jack
cardigan
in
whom
health
had
so
destroyed
all
traces
of
original
sin
that
she
might
have
retired
to
rest
with
ten
thousand
other
englishmen
without
knowing
the
difference
from
the
one
she
had
chosen
to
repose
beside
oh
she
would
say
of
him
in
her
amusing
way
jack
keeps
himself
so
fearfully
fit
he
never
had
a
day
illness
in
his
life
he
went
right
through
the
war
without
a
you
really
ca
imagine
how
fit
he
is
indeed
he
was
so
fit
that
he
could
see
when
she
was
flirting
which
was
such
a
comfort
in
a
way
all
the
same
she
was
quite
fond
of
him
so
far
as
one
could
be
of
a
and
of
the
two
little
cardigans
made
after
his
pattern
her
eyes
just
then
were
comparing
him
maliciously
with
prosper
profond
there
was
no
small
sport
or
game
which
monsieur
profond
had
not
played
at
too
it
seemed
from
skittles
to
and
worn
out
every
one
imogen
would
sometimes
wish
that
they
had
worn
out
jack
who
continued
to
play
at
them
and
talk
of
them
with
the
simple
zeal
of
a
learning
hockey
at
the
age
of
timothy
she
well
knew
that
jack
would
be
playing
carpet
golf
in
her
bedroom
and
wiping
somebody
he
was
telling
them
now
how
he
had
pipped
the
charmin
fellow
playin
a
very
good
game
at
the
last
hole
this
morning
and
how
he
had
pulled
down
to
caversham
since
lunch
and
trying
to
incite
prosper
profond
to
play
him
a
set
of
tennis
after
him
keep
him
fit
but
what
the
use
of
keepin
fit
said
monsieur
profond
yes
sir
murmured
michael
mont
what
do
you
keep
fit
for
jack
cried
imogen
enchanted
what
do
you
keep
fit
for
jack
cardigan
stared
with
all
his
health
the
questions
were
like
the
buzz
of
a
mosquito
and
he
put
up
his
hand
to
wipe
them
away
during
the
war
of
course
he
had
kept
fit
to
kill
germans
now
that
it
was
over
he
either
did
not
know
or
shrank
in
delicacy
from
explanation
of
his
moving
principle
but
he
right
said
monsieur
profond
unexpectedly
there
left
but
keepin
the
saying
too
deep
for
sunday
afternoon
would
have
passed
unanswered
but
for
the
mercurial
nature
of
young
mont
good
he
cried
that
the
great
discovery
of
the
war
we
all
thought
we
were
we
know
we
only
for
the
worse
said
monsieur
profond
genially
how
you
are
cheerful
prosper
murmured
annette
you
come
and
play
tennis
said
jack
cardigan
you
got
the
hump
we
soon
take
that
down
play
mont
i
hit
the
ball
about
at
this
juncture
soames
rose
ruffled
in
that
deep
instinct
of
preparation
for
the
future
which
guided
his
existence
when
fleur
he
heard
jack
cardigan
say
ah
and
why
did
she
come
he
passed
through
hall
and
porch
out
on
to
the
drive
and
stood
there
listening
for
the
car
all
was
still
and
sundayfied
the
lilacs
in
full
flower
scented
the
air
there
were
white
clouds
like
the
feathers
of
ducks
gilded
by
the
sunlight
memory
of
the
day
when
fleur
was
born
and
he
had
waited
in
such
agony
with
her
life
and
her
mother
balanced
in
his
hands
came
to
him
sharply
he
had
saved
her
then
to
be
the
flower
of
his
life
and
now
was
she
going
to
give
him
him
trouble
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
a
blackbird
broke
in
on
his
reverie
with
an
evening
great
big
fellow
up
in
that
soames
had
taken
quite
an
interest
in
his
birds
of
late
years
he
and
fleur
would
walk
round
and
watch
them
her
eyes
were
sharp
as
needles
and
she
knew
every
nest
he
saw
her
dog
a
retriever
lying
on
the
drive
in
a
patch
of
sunlight
and
called
to
him
hallo
old
for
her
too
the
dog
came
slowly
with
a
grudging
tail
and
soames
mechanically
laid
a
pat
on
his
head
the
dog
the
bird
the
lilac
all
were
part
of
fleur
for
him
no
more
no
less
fond
of
her
he
thought
fond
he
was
like
a
man
uninsured
with
his
ships
at
sea
uninsured
in
that
other
time
so
long
ago
when
he
would
wander
dumb
and
jealous
in
the
wilderness
of
london
longing
for
that
first
mother
of
this
infernal
boy
ah
there
was
the
car
at
last
it
drew
up
it
had
luggage
but
no
fleur
miss
fleur
is
walking
up
sir
by
the
walking
all
those
miles
soames
stared
the
man
face
had
the
beginning
of
a
smile
on
it
what
was
he
grinning
at
and
very
quickly
he
turned
saying
all
right
sims
and
went
into
the
house
he
mounted
to
the
once
more
he
had
from
there
a
view
of
the
river
bank
and
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
it
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
an
hour
at
least
before
her
figure
showed
there
walking
up
and
that
fellow
grin
the
he
turned
abruptly
from
the
window
he
spy
on
her
if
she
wanted
to
keep
things
from
must
he
could
not
spy
on
her
his
heart
felt
empty
and
bitterness
mounted
from
it
into
his
very
mouth
the
staccato
shouts
of
jack
cardigan
pursuing
the
ball
the
laugh
of
young
mont
rose
in
the
stillness
and
came
in
he
hoped
they
were
making
that
chap
profond
run
and
the
girl
in
la
vendimia
stood
with
her
arm
akimbo
and
her
dreamy
eyes
looking
past
him
done
all
i
could
for
you
he
thought
you
were
no
higher
than
my
knee
you
are
going
me
are
you
but
the
goya
copy
answered
not
brilliant
in
colour
just
beginning
to
tone
down
no
real
life
in
it
thought
soames
she
come
among
those
four
forsytes
of
the
third
and
as
one
might
say
fourth
generation
at
wansdon
under
the
downs
a
prolonged
unto
the
ninth
day
had
stretched
the
crossing
threads
of
tenacity
almost
to
never
had
fleur
been
so
fine
holly
so
watchful
val
so
jon
so
silent
and
disturbed
what
he
learned
of
farming
in
that
week
might
have
been
balanced
on
the
point
of
a
penknife
and
puffed
off
he
whose
nature
was
essentially
averse
from
intrigue
and
whose
adoration
of
fleur
disposed
him
to
think
that
any
need
for
concealing
it
was
skittles
chafed
and
fretted
yet
obeyed
taking
what
relief
he
could
in
the
few
moments
when
they
were
alone
on
thursday
while
they
were
standing
in
the
bay
window
of
the
dressed
for
dinner
she
said
to
him
jon
i
going
home
on
sunday
by
the
from
paddington
if
you
were
to
go
home
on
saturday
you
could
come
up
on
sunday
and
take
me
down
and
just
get
back
here
by
the
last
train
after
you
were
going
home
anyway
were
you
jon
nodded
anything
to
be
with
you
he
said
only
why
need
i
fleur
slipped
her
little
finger
into
his
palm
you
have
no
instinct
jon
you
must
leave
things
to
me
it
serious
about
our
people
we
simply
got
to
be
secret
at
present
if
we
want
to
be
the
door
was
opened
and
she
added
loudly
you
are
a
duffer
something
turned
over
within
jon
he
could
not
bear
this
subterfuge
about
a
feeling
so
natural
so
overwhelming
and
so
sweet
on
friday
night
about
eleven
he
had
packed
his
bag
and
was
leaning
out
of
his
window
half
miserable
and
half
lost
in
a
dream
of
paddington
station
when
he
heard
a
tiny
sound
as
of
a
tapping
on
his
door
he
rushed
to
it
and
listened
again
the
sound
it
was
a
nail
he
opened
oh
what
a
lovely
thing
came
in
i
wanted
to
show
you
my
fancy
dress
it
said
and
struck
an
attitude
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
jon
drew
a
long
breath
and
leaned
against
the
door
the
apparition
wore
white
muslin
on
its
head
a
fichu
round
its
bare
neck
over
a
dress
fulled
out
below
its
slender
waist
it
held
one
arm
akimbo
and
the
other
raised
holding
a
fan
which
touched
its
head
this
ought
to
be
a
basket
of
grapes
it
whispered
but
i
have
got
it
here
it
my
goya
dress
and
this
is
the
attitude
in
the
picture
do
you
like
it
it
a
the
apparition
pirouetted
touch
it
and
jon
knelt
down
and
took
the
skirt
reverently
grape
colour
came
the
whisper
all
jon
fingers
scarcely
touched
each
side
of
the
waist
he
looked
up
with
adoring
eyes
oh
jon
it
whispered
bent
kissed
his
forehead
pirouetted
again
and
gliding
out
was
gone
jon
stayed
on
his
knees
and
his
head
fell
forward
against
the
bed
how
long
he
stayed
like
that
he
did
not
know
the
little
the
tapping
nail
the
feet
the
skirts
in
a
on
about
him
and
before
his
closed
eyes
the
figure
stood
and
smiled
and
whispered
a
faint
perfume
of
narcissus
lingering
in
the
air
and
his
forehead
where
it
had
been
kissed
had
a
little
cool
place
between
the
brows
like
the
imprint
of
a
flower
love
filled
his
soul
that
love
of
boy
for
girl
which
knows
so
little
hopes
so
much
would
not
brush
the
down
off
for
the
world
and
must
become
in
time
a
fragrant
searing
humdrum
once
in
many
times
vintage
full
and
sweet
with
sunset
colour
on
the
grapes
enough
has
been
said
about
jon
forsyte
here
and
in
another
place
to
show
what
long
marches
lay
between
him
and
his
the
first
jolyon
in
dorset
down
by
the
sea
jon
was
sensitive
as
a
girl
more
sensitive
than
nine
out
of
ten
girls
of
the
day
imaginative
as
one
of
his
june
lame
duck
painters
affectionate
as
a
son
of
his
father
and
his
mother
naturally
would
be
and
yet
in
his
inner
tissue
there
was
something
of
the
old
founder
of
his
family
a
secret
tenacity
of
soul
a
dread
of
showing
his
feelings
a
determination
not
to
know
when
he
was
beaten
sensitive
imaginative
affectionate
boys
get
a
bad
time
at
school
but
jon
had
instinctively
kept
his
nature
dark
and
been
but
normally
unhappy
there
only
with
his
mother
had
he
up
till
then
been
absolutely
frank
and
natural
and
when
he
went
home
to
robin
hill
that
saturday
his
heart
was
heavy
because
fleur
had
said
that
he
must
not
be
frank
and
natural
with
her
from
whom
he
had
never
yet
kept
anything
must
not
even
tell
her
that
they
had
met
again
unless
he
found
that
she
knew
already
so
intolerable
did
this
seem
to
him
that
he
was
very
near
to
telegraphing
an
excuse
and
staying
up
in
london
and
the
first
thing
his
mother
said
to
him
was
so
you
had
our
little
friend
of
the
confectioner
there
jon
what
is
she
like
on
second
thoughts
with
relief
and
a
high
colour
jon
answered
oh
awfully
jolly
her
arm
pressed
his
jon
had
never
loved
her
so
much
as
in
that
minute
which
seemed
to
falsify
fleur
fears
and
to
release
his
soul
he
turned
to
look
at
her
but
something
in
her
smiling
which
only
he
perhaps
would
have
the
words
bubbling
up
in
him
could
fear
go
with
a
smile
if
so
there
was
fear
in
her
face
and
out
of
jon
tumbled
quite
other
words
about
farming
holly
and
the
downs
talking
fast
he
waited
for
her
to
come
back
to
fleur
but
she
did
not
nor
did
his
father
mention
her
though
of
course
he
too
must
know
what
deprivation
and
killing
of
reality
was
in
his
silence
about
he
was
so
full
of
her
when
his
mother
was
so
full
of
jon
and
his
father
so
full
of
his
mother
and
so
the
trio
spent
the
evening
of
that
saturday
after
dinner
his
mother
played
she
seemed
to
play
all
the
things
he
liked
best
and
he
sat
with
one
knee
clasped
and
his
hair
standing
up
where
his
fingers
had
run
through
it
he
gazed
at
his
mother
while
she
played
but
he
saw
in
the
moonlit
orchard
fleur
in
the
sunlit
fleur
in
that
fancy
dress
swaying
whispering
stooping
kissing
his
forehead
once
while
he
listened
he
forgot
himself
and
glanced
at
his
father
in
that
other
easy
chair
what
was
dad
looking
like
that
for
the
expression
on
his
face
was
so
sad
and
puzzling
it
filled
him
with
a
sort
of
remorse
so
that
he
got
up
and
went
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
father
chair
from
there
he
could
not
see
his
face
and
again
he
saw
his
mother
hands
slim
and
white
on
the
keys
in
the
profile
of
her
face
and
her
powdery
hair
and
down
the
long
room
in
the
open
window
where
the
may
night
walked
outside
when
he
went
up
to
bed
his
mother
came
into
his
room
she
stood
at
the
window
and
said
those
cypresses
your
grandfather
planted
down
there
have
done
wonderfully
i
always
think
they
look
beautiful
under
a
dropping
moon
i
wish
you
had
known
your
grandfather
were
you
married
to
father
when
he
was
alive
asked
jon
suddenly
no
dear
he
died
in
i
is
father
like
him
a
little
but
more
subtle
and
not
quite
so
i
know
from
grandfather
portrait
who
painted
that
one
of
june
ducks
but
it
quite
jon
slipped
his
hand
through
his
mother
arm
tell
me
about
the
family
quarrel
he
felt
her
arm
quivering
no
dear
that
for
your
father
some
day
if
he
thinks
then
it
was
serious
said
jon
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
and
there
was
a
silence
during
which
neither
knew
whether
the
arm
or
the
hand
within
it
were
quivering
most
some
people
said
irene
softly
think
the
moon
on
her
back
is
evil
to
me
she
always
lovely
look
at
those
cypress
shadows
jon
father
says
we
may
go
to
italy
you
and
i
for
two
months
would
you
like
jon
took
his
hand
from
under
her
arm
his
sensation
was
so
sharp
and
so
confused
italy
with
his
mother
a
fortnight
ago
it
would
have
been
perfection
now
it
filled
him
with
dismay
he
felt
that
the
sudden
suggestion
had
to
do
with
fleur
he
stammered
out
oh
yes
do
know
ought
i
just
begun
i
like
to
think
it
her
voice
answered
cool
and
gentle
yes
dear
think
it
over
but
better
now
than
when
you
begun
farming
seriously
italy
with
you
it
would
be
nice
jon
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
still
slim
and
firm
as
a
girl
do
you
think
you
ought
to
leave
father
he
said
feebly
feeling
very
mean
father
suggested
it
he
thinks
you
ought
to
see
italy
at
least
before
you
settle
down
to
the
sense
of
meanness
died
in
jon
he
knew
his
father
and
his
mother
were
not
speaking
frankly
no
more
than
he
himself
they
wanted
to
keep
him
from
fleur
his
heart
hardened
and
as
if
she
felt
that
process
going
on
his
mother
said
darling
have
a
good
sleep
and
think
it
over
but
it
would
be
lovely
she
pressed
him
to
her
so
quickly
that
he
did
not
see
her
face
jon
stood
feeling
exactly
as
he
used
to
when
he
was
a
naughty
little
boy
sore
because
he
was
not
loving
and
because
he
was
justified
in
his
own
eyes
but
irene
after
she
had
stood
a
moment
in
her
own
room
passed
through
the
between
it
and
her
husband
well
he
will
think
it
over
watching
her
lips
that
wore
a
little
drawn
smile
jolyon
said
quietly
you
had
better
let
me
tell
him
and
have
done
with
it
after
all
jon
has
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
he
has
only
to
only
he
ca
understand
that
i
believe
i
could
have
at
his
irene
caught
his
hand
you
were
always
more
of
a
realist
than
jon
and
never
so
that
true
said
jolyon
it
queer
is
it
you
and
i
would
tell
our
stories
to
the
world
without
a
particle
of
shame
but
our
own
boy
stumps
we
never
cared
whether
the
world
approves
or
jon
would
not
disapprove
of
us
oh
jolyon
yes
he
in
love
i
feel
he
in
love
and
he
say
mother
once
married
without
love
how
could
she
have
it
seem
to
him
a
crime
and
so
it
was
jolyon
took
her
hand
and
said
with
a
wry
smile
ah
why
on
earth
are
we
born
young
now
if
only
we
were
born
old
and
grew
younger
year
by
year
we
should
understand
how
things
happen
and
drop
all
our
cursed
intolerance
but
you
know
if
the
boy
is
really
in
love
he
wo
forget
even
if
he
goes
to
italy
we
a
tenacious
breed
and
he
know
by
instinct
why
he
being
sent
nothing
will
really
cure
him
but
the
shock
of
being
let
me
try
jolyon
stood
a
moment
without
speaking
between
this
devil
and
this
deep
pain
of
a
dreaded
disclosure
and
the
grief
of
losing
his
wife
for
two
secretly
hoped
for
the
devil
yet
if
she
wished
for
the
deep
sea
he
must
put
up
with
it
after
all
it
would
be
training
for
that
departure
from
which
there
would
be
no
return
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
he
kissed
her
eyes
and
said
as
you
will
my
that
small
emotion
love
grows
amazingly
when
threatened
with
extinction
jon
reached
paddington
station
half
an
hour
before
his
time
and
a
full
week
after
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
stood
at
the
appointed
bookstall
amid
a
crowd
of
sunday
travellers
in
a
harris
tweed
suit
exhaling
as
it
were
the
emotion
of
his
thumping
heart
he
read
the
names
of
the
novels
on
the
and
bought
one
at
last
to
avoid
being
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
clerk
it
was
called
the
heart
of
the
trail
which
must
mean
something
though
it
did
not
seem
to
he
also
bought
the
lady
mirror
and
the
every
minute
was
an
hour
long
and
full
of
horrid
imaginings
after
nineteen
had
passed
he
saw
her
with
a
bag
and
a
porter
wheeling
her
luggage
she
came
swiftly
she
came
cool
she
greeted
him
as
if
he
were
a
brother
first
class
she
said
to
the
porter
corner
seats
jon
admired
her
frightful
ca
we
get
a
carriage
to
ourselves
he
whispered
no
good
it
a
stopping
train
after
maidenhead
perhaps
look
natural
jon
screwed
his
features
into
a
scowl
they
got
two
other
beasts
heaven
he
tipped
the
porter
unnaturally
in
his
confusion
the
brute
deserved
nothing
for
putting
them
in
there
and
looking
as
if
he
knew
all
about
it
into
the
bargain
fleur
hid
herself
behind
the
lady
jon
imitated
her
behind
the
the
train
started
fleur
let
the
lady
mirror
fall
and
leaned
forward
well
she
said
it
seemed
about
fifteen
she
nodded
and
jon
face
lighted
up
at
once
look
natural
murmured
fleur
and
went
off
into
a
bubble
of
laughter
it
hurt
him
how
could
he
look
natural
with
italy
hanging
over
him
he
had
meant
to
break
it
to
her
gently
but
now
he
blurted
it
out
they
want
me
to
go
to
italy
with
mother
for
two
fleur
drooped
her
eyelids
turned
a
little
pale
and
bit
her
lips
oh
she
said
it
was
all
but
it
was
much
that
oh
was
like
the
quick
drawback
of
the
wrist
in
fencing
ready
for
riposte
it
came
you
must
go
go
said
jon
in
a
strangled
voice
of
no
said
fleur
six
weeks
you
have
forgotten
me
by
then
meet
in
the
national
gallery
the
day
after
you
get
jon
laughed
but
suppose
you
forgotten
me
he
muttered
into
the
noise
of
the
train
fleur
shook
her
head
some
other
murmured
jon
her
foot
touched
his
no
other
beast
she
said
lifting
the
lady
the
train
stopped
two
passengers
got
out
and
one
got
in
shall
die
thought
jon
we
not
alone
at
all
the
train
went
on
and
again
fleur
leaned
forward
i
never
let
go
she
said
do
you
jon
shook
his
head
vehemently
never
he
said
will
you
write
to
me
no
but
you
my
she
had
a
club
she
was
wonderful
did
you
pump
holly
he
muttered
yes
but
i
got
nothing
i
did
dare
pump
what
can
it
be
cried
jon
i
shall
find
out
all
a
long
silence
followed
till
fleur
said
this
is
maidenhead
stand
by
jon
the
train
stopped
the
remaining
passenger
got
out
fleur
drew
down
her
blind
quick
she
cried
hang
out
look
as
much
of
a
beast
as
you
jon
blew
his
nose
and
scowled
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
scowled
like
that
an
old
lady
recoiled
a
young
one
tried
the
handle
it
turned
but
the
door
would
not
open
the
train
moved
the
young
lady
darted
to
another
carriage
what
luck
cried
jon
it
yes
said
fleur
i
was
holding
the
train
moved
out
and
jon
fell
on
his
knees
look
out
for
the
corridor
she
whispered
her
lips
met
his
and
though
their
kiss
only
lasted
perhaps
ten
seconds
jon
soul
left
his
body
and
went
so
far
beyond
that
when
he
was
again
sitting
opposite
that
demure
figure
he
was
pale
as
death
he
heard
her
sigh
and
the
sound
seemed
to
him
the
most
precious
he
had
ever
exquisite
declaration
that
he
meant
something
to
her
six
weeks
is
really
long
she
said
and
you
can
easily
make
it
six
if
you
keep
your
head
out
there
and
never
seem
to
think
of
jon
gasped
this
is
just
what
really
wanted
jon
to
convince
them
you
see
if
we
just
as
bad
when
you
come
back
they
stop
being
ridiculous
about
it
only
i
sorry
it
not
spain
there
a
girl
in
a
goya
picture
at
madrid
who
like
me
father
says
only
she
got
a
copy
of
it
was
to
jon
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
piercing
through
a
fog
i
make
it
spain
he
said
mother
wo
mind
she
never
been
there
and
my
father
thinks
a
lot
of
oh
yes
he
a
he
only
said
jon
with
honesty
when
we
come
to
reading
jon
get
out
first
and
go
down
to
caversham
lock
and
wait
for
me
i
send
the
car
home
and
we
walk
by
the
jon
seized
her
hand
in
gratitude
and
they
sat
silent
with
the
world
well
lost
and
one
eye
on
the
corridor
but
the
train
seemed
to
run
twice
as
fast
now
and
its
sound
was
almost
lost
in
that
of
sighing
we
getting
near
said
fleur
the
awfully
exposed
one
more
oh
jon
do
forget
jon
answered
with
his
kiss
and
very
soon
a
flushed
youth
could
have
been
they
from
the
train
and
hurrying
along
the
platform
searching
his
pockets
for
his
ticket
when
at
last
she
rejoined
him
on
the
a
little
beyond
caversham
lock
he
had
made
an
effort
and
regained
some
measure
of
equanimity
if
they
had
to
part
he
would
not
make
a
scene
a
breeze
by
the
bright
river
threw
the
white
side
of
the
willow
leaves
up
into
the
sunlight
and
followed
those
two
with
its
faint
rustle
i
told
our
chauffeur
that
i
was
said
fleur
did
you
look
pretty
natural
as
you
went
out
i
do
know
what
is
natural
it
natural
to
you
to
look
seriously
happy
when
i
first
saw
you
i
thought
you
were
a
bit
like
other
exactly
what
i
thought
when
i
saw
you
i
knew
at
once
i
should
never
love
anybody
fleur
laughed
we
absurdly
young
and
love
young
dream
is
out
of
date
jon
besides
it
awfully
wasteful
think
of
all
the
fun
you
might
have
you
have
begun
even
it
a
shame
really
and
there
me
i
wonder
confusion
came
on
jon
spirit
how
could
she
say
such
things
just
as
they
were
going
to
part
if
you
feel
like
that
he
said
i
ca
go
i
shall
tell
mother
that
i
ought
to
try
and
work
there
always
the
condition
of
the
world
the
condition
of
the
world
jon
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
but
there
is
he
said
think
of
the
people
starving
fleur
shook
her
head
no
no
i
never
never
will
make
myself
miserable
for
nothing
but
there
an
awful
state
of
things
and
of
course
one
ought
to
oh
yes
i
know
all
that
but
you
ca
help
people
jon
hopeless
when
you
pull
them
out
they
only
get
into
another
hole
look
at
them
still
fighting
and
plotting
and
struggling
though
dying
in
heaps
all
the
time
idiots
are
you
sorry
for
them
oh
but
i
not
going
to
make
myself
unhappy
about
it
that
no
and
they
were
silent
disturbed
by
this
first
glimpse
of
each
natures
i
think
people
are
brutes
and
idiots
said
fleur
stubbornly
i
think
they
poor
wretches
said
jon
it
was
as
if
they
had
at
this
supreme
and
awful
moment
with
parting
visible
out
there
in
that
last
gap
of
the
willows
well
go
and
help
your
poor
wretches
and
do
think
of
jon
stood
still
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
and
his
limbs
trembled
fleur
too
had
stopped
and
was
frowning
at
the
river
i
must
believe
in
things
said
jon
with
a
sort
of
agony
we
all
meant
to
enjoy
fleur
laughed
yes
and
that
what
you
wo
do
if
you
do
take
care
but
perhaps
your
idea
of
enjoyment
is
to
make
yourself
wretched
there
are
lots
of
people
like
that
of
she
was
pale
her
eyes
had
darkened
her
lips
had
thinned
was
it
fleur
thus
staring
at
the
water
jon
had
an
unreal
feeling
as
if
he
were
passing
through
the
scene
in
a
book
where
the
lover
has
to
choose
between
love
and
duty
but
just
then
she
looked
round
at
him
never
was
anything
so
intoxicating
as
that
vivacious
look
it
acted
on
him
exactly
as
the
tug
of
a
chain
acts
on
a
him
up
to
her
with
his
tail
wagging
and
his
tongue
out
do
let
be
silly
she
said
time
too
short
look
jon
you
can
just
see
where
i
got
to
cross
the
river
there
round
the
bend
where
the
woods
jon
saw
a
gable
a
chimney
or
two
a
patch
of
wall
through
the
felt
his
heart
sink
i
must
dawdle
any
more
it
no
good
going
beyond
the
next
hedge
it
gets
all
open
let
get
on
to
it
and
say
they
went
side
by
side
hand
in
hand
silently
toward
the
hedge
where
the
both
pink
and
white
was
in
full
bloom
my
club
the
stratton
street
piccadilly
letters
there
will
be
quite
safe
and
i
almost
always
up
once
a
jon
nodded
his
face
had
become
extremely
set
his
eyes
stared
straight
before
him
the
of
may
said
fleur
on
the
ninth
of
july
i
shall
be
in
front
of
the
and
ariadne
at
three
will
you
i
if
you
feel
as
bad
as
i
it
all
right
let
those
people
pass
a
man
and
woman
airing
their
children
went
by
strung
out
in
sunday
fashion
the
last
of
them
passed
the
wicket
gate
domesticity
said
fleur
and
blotted
herself
against
the
hawthorn
hedge
the
blossom
sprayed
out
above
her
head
and
one
pink
cluster
brushed
her
cheek
jon
put
up
his
hand
jealously
to
keep
it
off
for
a
second
they
stood
with
hands
hard
clasped
then
their
lips
met
for
the
third
time
and
when
they
parted
fleur
broke
away
and
fled
through
the
wicket
gate
jon
stood
where
she
had
left
him
with
his
forehead
against
that
pink
cluster
gone
for
an
seven
weeks
all
but
two
days
and
here
he
was
wasting
the
last
sight
of
her
he
rushed
to
the
gate
she
was
walking
swiftly
on
the
heels
of
the
straggling
children
she
turned
her
head
he
saw
her
hand
make
a
little
flitting
gesture
then
she
sped
on
and
the
trailing
family
blotted
her
out
from
his
view
the
words
of
a
comic
paddington
ever
known
he
gave
a
sepulchral
paddington
came
into
his
head
and
he
sped
incontinently
back
to
reading
station
all
the
way
up
to
london
and
down
to
wansdon
he
sat
with
the
heart
of
the
trail
open
on
his
knee
knitting
in
his
head
a
poem
so
full
of
feeling
that
it
would
not
rhyme
fleur
sped
on
she
had
need
of
rapid
motion
she
was
late
and
wanted
all
her
wits
about
her
when
she
got
in
she
passed
the
islands
the
station
and
hotel
and
was
about
to
take
the
ferry
when
she
saw
a
skiff
with
a
young
man
standing
up
in
it
and
holding
to
the
bushes
miss
forsyte
he
said
let
me
put
you
across
i
come
on
she
looked
at
him
in
blank
amazement
it
all
right
i
been
having
tea
with
your
people
i
thought
save
you
the
last
bit
it
on
my
way
i
just
off
back
to
pangbourne
my
name
mont
i
saw
you
at
the
your
father
invited
me
to
see
his
oh
said
fleur
to
this
young
man
she
owed
jon
and
taking
his
hand
she
stepped
down
into
the
skiff
still
emotional
and
a
little
out
of
breath
she
sat
silent
not
so
the
young
man
she
had
never
heard
any
one
say
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
he
told
her
his
age
his
weight
ten
stone
eleven
his
place
of
residence
not
far
away
described
his
sensations
under
fire
and
what
it
felt
like
to
be
gassed
criticized
the
juno
mentioned
his
own
conception
of
that
goddess
commented
on
the
goya
copy
said
fleur
was
not
too
awfully
like
it
sketched
in
rapidly
the
condition
of
england
spoke
of
monsieur
whatever
his
name
an
awful
sport
thought
her
father
had
some
ripping
pictures
and
some
rather
hoped
he
might
row
down
again
and
take
her
on
the
river
because
he
was
quite
trustworthy
inquired
her
opinion
of
tchekov
gave
her
his
own
wished
they
could
go
to
the
russian
ballet
together
some
the
name
fleur
forsyte
simply
topping
cursed
his
people
for
giving
him
the
name
of
michael
on
the
top
of
mont
outlined
his
father
and
said
that
if
she
wanted
a
good
book
she
should
read
job
his
father
was
rather
like
job
while
job
still
had
land
but
job
did
have
land
fleur
murmured
he
only
had
flocks
and
herds
and
moved
ah
answered
michael
mont
i
wish
my
would
move
on
not
that
i
want
his
land
land
an
awful
bore
in
these
days
do
you
think
we
never
have
it
in
my
family
said
fleur
we
have
everything
else
i
believe
one
of
my
once
had
a
sentimental
farm
in
dorset
because
we
came
from
there
originally
but
it
cost
him
more
than
it
made
him
did
he
sell
it
no
he
kept
why
because
nobody
would
buy
good
for
the
old
boy
no
it
was
good
for
him
father
says
it
soured
him
his
name
was
what
a
corking
name
do
you
know
that
we
getting
farther
off
not
nearer
this
river
splendid
cried
mont
dipping
his
sculls
vaguely
it
good
to
meet
a
girl
who
got
but
better
to
meet
a
young
man
who
got
it
in
the
young
mont
raised
a
hand
to
tear
his
hair
look
out
cried
fleur
your
scull

right
it
thick
enough
to
bear
a
do
you
mind
sculling
said
fleur
severely
i
want
to
get
ah
said
mont
but
when
you
get
in
you
see
i
sha
see
you
any
more
fini
as
the
french
girl
said
when
she
jumped
on
her
bed
after
saying
her
prayers
do
you
bless
the
day
that
gave
you
a
french
mother
and
a
name
like
yours
i
like
my
name
but
father
gave
it
me
mother
wanted
me
called
which
is
absurd
do
you
mind
calling
me
and
letting
me
call
you
it
in
the
spirit
of
the
i
do
mind
anything
so
long
as
i
get
mont
caught
a
little
crab
and
answered
that
was
a
nasty
one
please
i
and
he
did
for
several
strokes
looking
at
her
with
rueful
eagerness
of
course
you
know
he
ejaculated
pausing
that
i
came
to
see
you
not
your
father
fleur
rose
if
you
do
row
i
shall
get
out
and
really
and
truly
then
i
could
come
in
after
mr
mont
i
late
and
tired
please
put
me
on
shore
at
when
she
stepped
out
on
to
the
garden
he
rose
and
grasping
his
hair
with
both
hands
looked
at
her
fleur
smiled
do
cried
the
irrepressible
mont
i
know
you
going
to
say
damned
hair
fleur
whisked
round
threw
him
a
wave
of
her
hand
mr
she
called
and
was
gone
among
the
she
looked
at
her
and
the
windows
of
the
house
it
struck
her
as
curiously
uninhabited
past
six
the
pigeons
were
just
gathering
to
roost
and
sunlight
slanted
on
the
dovecot
on
their
snowy
feathers
and
beyond
in
a
shower
on
the
top
boughs
of
the
woods
the
click
of
came
from
the
cardigan
no
doubt
a
faint
rustling
too
from
an
startling
southerner
in
this
old
english
garden
she
reached
the
verandah
and
was
passing
in
but
stopped
at
the
sound
of
voices
from
the
to
her
left
mother
monsieur
profond
from
behind
the
verandah
screen
which
fenced
the
she
heard
these
words

did
father
know
that
he
called
her
mother
annette
always
on
the
side
of
her
children
are
ever
on
one
side
or
the
other
in
houses
where
relations
are
a
little
stood
uncertain
her
mother
was
speaking
in
her
low
pleasing
slightly
metallic
word
she
caught
and
profond
answer
all
fleur
frowned
a
little
sound
came
out
into
the
stillness
then
profond
voice
takin
a
small
fleur
darted
through
the
window
into
the
there
he
came
from
the
crossing
the
verandah
down
the
lawn
and
the
click
of
which
in
listening
for
other
sounds
she
had
ceased
to
hear
began
again
she
shook
herself
passed
into
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
her
mother
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
between
the
windows
her
knees
crossed
her
head
resting
on
a
cushion
her
lips
half
parted
her
eyes
half
closed
she
looked
extraordinarily
handsome
ah
here
you
are
fleur
your
father
is
beginning
to
where
is
he
in
the
go
up
what
are
you
going
to
do
mother
i
go
up
to
london
with
your
i
thought
you
might
be
will
you
get
me
a
quite
plain
parasol
what
colour
green
they
all
going
back
i
yes
all
you
will
console
your
father
kiss
me
fleur
crossed
the
room
stooped
received
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
and
went
out
past
the
impress
of
a
form
on
the
in
the
other
corner
she
ran
fleur
was
by
no
means
the
daughter
who
demands
the
regulation
of
her
parents
lives
in
accordance
with
the
standard
imposed
upon
herself
she
claimed
to
regulate
her
own
life
not
those
of
others
besides
an
unerring
instinct
for
what
was
likely
to
advantage
her
own
case
was
already
at
work
in
a
disturbed
domestic
atmosphere
the
heart
she
had
set
on
jon
would
have
a
better
chance
none
the
less
was
she
offended
as
a
flower
by
a
crisping
wind
if
that
man
had
really
been
kissing
her
mother
it
and
her
father
ought
to
know
demain
all
right
and
her
mother
going
up
to
town
she
turned
into
her
bedroom
and
hung
out
of
the
window
to
cool
her
face
which
had
suddenly
grown
very
hot
jon
must
be
at
the
station
by
now
what
did
her
father
know
about
jon
probably
nearly
she
changed
her
dress
so
as
to
look
as
if
she
had
been
in
some
time
and
ran
up
to
the
gallery
soames
was
standing
stubbornly
still
before
his
alfred
picture
he
loved
best
he
did
not
turn
at
the
sound
of
the
door
but
she
knew
he
had
heard
and
she
knew
he
was
hurt
she
came
up
softly
behind
him
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
poked
her
face
over
his
shoulder
till
her
cheek
lay
against
his
it
was
an
advance
which
had
never
yet
failed
but
it
failed
her
now
and
she
augured
the
worst
well
he
said
stonily
so
you
come
is
that
all
murmured
fleur
from
a
bad
parent
and
she
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his
soames
shook
his
head
so
far
as
that
was
possible
why
do
you
keep
me
on
tenterhooks
like
this
putting
me
off
and
off
darling
it
was
very
harmless
much
you
know
what
harmless
and
what
fleur
dropped
her
arms
well
then
dear
suppose
you
tell
me
and
be
quite
frank
about
and
she
went
over
to
the
her
father
had
turned
from
his
picture
and
was
staring
at
his
feet
he
looked
very
grey
has
nice
small
feet
she
thought
catching
his
eye
at
once
averted
from
her
you
my
only
comfort
said
soames
suddenly
and
you
go
on
like
fleur
heart
began
to
beat
like
what
dear
again
soames
gave
her
a
look
which
but
for
the
affection
in
it
might
have
been
called
furtive
you
know
what
i
told
you
he
said
i
do
choose
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
branch
of
our
yes
ducky
but
i
do
know
why
i
soames
turned
on
his
heel
i
not
going
into
the
reasons
he
said
you
ought
to
trust
me
fleur
the
way
he
spoke
those
words
affected
fleur
but
she
thought
of
jon
and
was
silent
tapping
her
foot
against
the
wainscot
unconsciously
she
had
assumed
a
modern
attitude
with
one
leg
twisted
in
and
out
of
the
other
with
her
chin
on
one
bent
wrist
her
other
arm
across
her
chest
and
its
hand
hugging
her
elbow
there
was
not
a
line
of
her
that
was
not
involuted
and
spite
of
retained
a
certain
grace
you
knew
my
wishes
soames
went
on
and
yet
you
stayed
on
there
four
days
and
i
suppose
that
boy
came
with
you
fleur
kept
her
eyes
on
him
i
do
ask
you
anything
said
soames
i
make
no
inquisition
where
you
fleur
suddenly
stood
up
leaning
out
at
the
window
with
her
chin
on
her
hands
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
trees
the
pigeons
were
perched
quite
still
on
the
edge
of
the
the
click
of
the
mounted
and
a
faint
radiance
shone
out
below
where
jack
cardigan
had
turned
the
light
up
will
it
make
you
any
happier
she
said
suddenly
if
i
promise
you
not
to
see
him
for
next
six
weeks
she
was
not
prepared
for
a
sort
of
tremble
in
the
blankness
of
his
voice
six
weeks
six
years
more
like
do
delude
yourself
fleur
do
delude
yourself
fleur
turned
in
alarm
father
what
is
it
soames
came
close
enough
to
see
her
face
do
tell
me
he
said
that
you
foolish
enough
to
have
any
feeling
beyond
caprice
that
would
be
too
much
and
he
laughed
fleur
who
had
never
heard
him
laugh
like
that
thought
it
is
deep
oh
what
is
it
and
putting
her
hand
through
his
arm
she
said
lightly
no
of
course
caprice
only
i
like
my
caprices
and
i
do
like
yours
mine
said
soames
bitterly
and
turned
away
the
light
outside
had
chilled
and
threw
a
chalky
whiteness
on
the
river
the
trees
had
lost
all
gaiety
of
colour
she
felt
a
sudden
hunger
for
jon
face
for
his
hands
and
the
feel
of
his
lips
again
on
hers
and
pressing
her
arms
tight
across
her
breast
she
forced
out
a
little
light
laugh
o
la
la
what
a
small
fuss
as
profond
would
say
father
i
do
like
that
she
saw
him
stop
and
take
something
out
of
his
breast
pocket
you
do
he
said
why
nothing
murmured
fleur
just
caprice
no
said
soames
not
caprice
and
he
tore
what
was
in
his
hands
across
you
right
i
do
like
him
either
look
said
fleur
softly
there
he
goes
i
hate
his
shoes
they
make
any
down
in
the
failing
light
prosper
profond
moved
his
hands
in
his
side
pockets
whistling
softly
in
his
beard
he
stopped
and
glanced
up
at
the
sky
as
if
saying
i
do
think
much
of
that
small
fleur
drew
back
is
he
a
great
cat
she
whispered
and
the
sharp
click
of
the
rose
as
if
jack
cardigan
had
capped
the
cat
the
moon
caprice
and
tragedy
with
in
off
the
red
monsieur
profond
had
resumed
his
stroll
to
a
teasing
little
tune
in
his
beard
what
was
it
oh
yes
from
rigoletto
donna
a
just
what
he
would
think
she
squeezed
her
father
arm
prowling
she
muttered
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
it
was
past
that
disillusioned
moment
which
divides
the
day
and
and
lingering
and
warm
with
hawthorn
scent
and
lilac
scent
clinging
on
the
riverside
air
a
blackbird
suddenly
burst
out
jon
would
be
in
london
by
now
in
the
park
perhaps
crossing
the
serpentine
thinking
of
her
a
little
sound
beside
her
made
her
turn
her
eyes
her
father
was
again
tearing
the
paper
in
his
hands
fleur
saw
it
was
a
cheque
i
sha
sell
him
my
gauguin
he
said
i
do
know
what
your
aunt

imogen
see
in
or
your
mother

soames
father
she
thought
never
looks
really
happy
i
do
want
to
make
him
worse
but
of
course
i
shall
have
to
when
jon
comes
back
oh
well
sufficient
unto
the
night
i
going
to
dress
she
said
in
her
room
she
had
a
fancy
to
put
on
her
freak
dress
it
was
of
gold
tissue
with
little
trousers
of
the
same
tightly
drawn
in
at
the
ankles
a
page
cape
slung
from
the
shoulders
little
gold
shoes
and
a
mercury
helmet
and
all
over
her
were
tiny
gold
bells
especially
on
the
helmet
so
that
if
she
shook
her
head
she
pealed
when
she
was
dressed
she
felt
quite
sick
because
jon
could
not
see
her
it
even
seemed
a
pity
that
the
sprightly
young
man
michael
mont
would
not
have
a
view
but
the
gong
had
sounded
and
she
went
down
she
made
a
sensation
in
the
winifred
thought
it
most
imogen
was
enraptured
jack
cardigan
called
it
stunning
ripping
topping
and
monsieur
profond
smiling
with
his
eyes
said
that
a
nice
small
dress
her
mother
very
handsome
in
black
sat
looking
at
her
and
said
nothing
it
remained
for
her
father
to
apply
the
test
of
common
sense
what
did
you
put
on
that
thing
for
you
not
going
to

spun
round
and
the
bells
pealed

soames
stared
at
her
and
turning
away
gave
his
arm
to
winifred

took
her
mother
prosper
profond
took
imogen

went
in
by
herself
with
her
bells
jingling
the
small
moon
had
soon
dropped
down
and
may
night
had
fallen
soft
and
warm
enwrapping
with
its
colour
and
its
scents
the
billion
caprices
intrigues
passions
longings
and
regrets
of
men
and
women
happy
was
jack
cardigan
who
snored
into
imogen
white
shoulder
fit
as
a
flea
or
timothy
in
his
mausoleum
too
old
for
anything
but
baby
slumber
for
so
many
lay
awake
or
dreamed
teased
by
the
of
the
world
the
dew
fell
and
the
flowers
closed
cattle
grazed
on
in
the
river
meadows
feeling
with
their
tongues
for
the
grass
they
could
not
see
and
the
sheep
on
the
downs
lay
quiet
as
stones
pheasants
in
the
tall
trees
of
the
pangbourne
woods
larks
on
their
grassy
nests
above
the
at
wansdon
swallows
in
the
eaves
at
robin
hill
and
the
sparrows
of
mayfair
all
made
a
dreamless
night
of
it
soothed
by
the
lack
of
wind
the
mayfly
filly
hardly
accustomed
to
her
new
quarters
scraped
at
her
straw
a
little
and
the
few
moths
vigorous
in
the
warm
darkness
but
the
peace
of
night
lay
in
the
brain
of
all
nature
colourless
and
still
men
and
women
alone
riding
the
of
anxiety
or
love
burned
their
wavering
tapers
of
dream
and
thought
into
the
lonely
hours
fleur
leaning
out
of
her
window
heard
the
hall
clock
muffled
chime
of
twelve
the
tiny
splash
of
a
fish
the
sudden
shaking
of
an
leaves
in
the
puffs
of
breeze
that
rose
along
the
river
the
distant
rumble
of
a
night
train
and
time
and
again
the
sounds
which
none
can
put
a
name
to
in
the
darkness
soft
obscure
expressions
of
uncatalogued
emotions
from
man
and
beast
bird
and
machine
or
maybe
from
departed
forsytes
darties
cardigans
taking
night
strolls
back
into
a
world
which
had
once
suited
their
embodied
spirits
but
fleur
heeded
not
these
sounds
her
spirit
far
from
disembodied
fled
with
swift
wing
from
to
flowery
hedge
straining
after
jon
tenacious
of
his
forbidden
image
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
which
was
taboo
and
she
crinkled
her
nose
retrieving
from
the
perfume
of
the
riverside
night
that
moment
when
his
hand
slipped
between
the
mayflowers
and
her
cheek
long
she
leaned
out
in
her
freak
dress
keen
to
burn
her
wings
at
candle
while
the
moths
brushed
her
cheeks
on
their
pilgrimage
to
the
lamp
on
her
ignorant
that
in
a
forsyte
house
there
is
no
open
flame
but
at
last
even
she
felt
sleepy
and
forgetting
her
bells
drew
quickly
in
through
the
open
window
of
his
room
alongside
annette
soames
wakeful
too
heard
their
thin
faint
tinkle
as
it
might
be
shaken
from
stars
or
the
dewdrops
falling
from
a
flower
if
one
could
hear
such
sounds
he
thought
ca
tell
she
wilful
what
shall
i
do
fleur
and
long
into
the
small
night
he
brooded
part
ii
and
son
to
say
that
jon
forsyte
accompanied
his
mother
to
spain
unwillingly
would
scarcely
have
been
adequate
he
went
as
a
dog
goes
for
a
walk
with
its
mistress
leaving
a
choice
on
the
lawn
he
went
looking
back
at
it
forsytes
deprived
of
their
are
wont
to
sulk
but
jon
had
little
sulkiness
in
his
composition
he
adored
his
mother
and
it
was
his
first
travel
spain
had
become
italy
by
his
simply
saying
i
rather
go
to
spain
mum
you
been
to
italy
so
many
times
i
like
it
new
to
both
of
the
fellow
was
subtle
besides
being
naive
he
never
forgot
that
he
was
going
to
shorten
the
proposed
two
months
into
six
weeks
and
must
therefore
show
no
sign
of
wishing
to
do
so
for
one
with
so
enticing
a
and
so
fixed
an
idea
he
made
a
good
enough
travelling
companion
indifferent
to
where
or
when
he
arrived
superior
to
food
and
thoroughly
appreciative
of
a
country
strange
to
the
most
travelled
englishman
fleur
wisdom
in
refusing
to
write
to
him
was
profound
for
he
reached
each
new
place
entirely
without
hope
or
fever
and
could
concentrate
immediate
attention
on
the
donkeys
and
tumbling
bells
the
priests
patios
beggars
children
crowing
cocks
sombreros
old
high
white
villages
goats
greening
plains
singing
birds
in
tiny
cages
watersellers
sunsets
melons
mules
great
churches
pictures
and
swimming
mountains

a
fascinating
land
it
was
already
hot
and
they
enjoyed
an
absence
of
their
compatriots
jon
who
so
far
as
he
knew
had
no
blood
in
him
which
was
not
english
was
often
innately
unhappy
in
the
presence
of
his
own
countrymen
he
felt
they
had
no
nonsense
about
them
and
took
a
more
practical
view
of
things
than
himself
he
confided
to
his
mother
that
he
must
be
an
unsociable
was
jolly
to
be
away
from
everybody
who
could
talk
about
the
things
people
did
talk
about
to
which
irene
had
replied
simply
yes
jon
i
in
this
isolation
he
had
unparalleled
opportunities
of
appreciating
what
few
sons
can
apprehend
the
of
a
love
knowledge
of
something
kept
from
her
made
him
no
doubt
unduly
sensitive
and
a
southern
people
stimulated
his
admiration
for
her
type
of
beauty
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
called
spanish
but
which
he
now
perceived
to
be
no
such
thing
her
beauty
was
neither
english
french
spanish
nor
was
special
he
appreciated
too
as
never
before
his
mother
subtlety
of
instinct
he
could
not
tell
for
instance
whether
she
had
noticed
his
absorption
in
that
goya
picture
la
vendimia
or
whether
she
knew
that
he
had
slipped
back
there
after
lunch
and
again
next
morning
to
stand
before
it
full
half
an
hour
a
second
and
third
time
it
was
not
fleur
of
course
but
like
enough
to
give
him
dear
to
her
standing
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
with
her
hand
held
above
her
head
to
keep
a
postcard
reproduction
of
this
picture
in
his
pocket
and
slip
it
out
to
look
at
became
for
jon
one
of
those
bad
habits
which
soon
or
late
disclose
themselves
to
eyes
sharpened
by
love
fear
or
jealousy
and
his
mother
were
sharpened
by
all
three
in
granada
he
was
fairly
caught
sitting
on
a
stone
bench
in
a
little
battlemented
garden
on
the
alhambra
hill
whence
he
ought
to
have
been
looking
at
the
view
his
mother
he
had
thought
was
examining
the
potted
stocks
between
the
polled
acacias
when
her
voice
said
is
that
your
favourite
goya
jon
he
checked
too
late
a
movement
such
as
he
might
have
made
at
school
to
conceal
some
surreptitious
document
and
answered
it
certainly
is
most
charming
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
your
father
would
go
crazy
about
goya
i
do
believe
he
saw
them
when
he
was
in
spain
in
in
years
before
he
had
been
born
what
had
been
the
previous
existences
of
his
father
and
his
mother
if
they
had
a
right
to
share
in
his
future
surely
he
had
a
right
to
share
in
their
pasts
he
looked
up
at
her
but
something
in
her
look
of
life
the
mysterious
impress
of
emotions
experience
and
with
its
incalculable
depth
its
purchased
sanctity
to
make
curiosity
impertinent
his
mother
must
have
had
a
wonderfully
interesting
life
she
was
so
beautiful
and
he
could
not
frame
what
he
felt
about
her
he
got
up
and
stood
gazing
down
at
the
town
at
the
plain
all
green
with
crops
and
the
ring
of
mountains
glamorous
in
sinking
sunlight
her
life
was
like
the
past
of
this
old
moorish
city
full
deep
own
life
as
yet
such
a
baby
of
a
thing
hopelessly
ignorant
and
innocent
they
said
that
in
those
mountains
to
the
west
which
rose
sheer
from
the
plain
as
if
out
of
a
sea
phoenicians
had
dark
strange
secret
race
above
the
land
his
mother
life
was
as
unknown
to
him
as
secret
as
that
phoenician
past
was
to
the
town
down
there
whose
cocks
crowed
and
whose
children
played
and
clamoured
so
gaily
day
in
day
out
he
felt
aggrieved
that
she
should
know
all
about
him
and
he
nothing
about
her
except
that
she
loved
him
and
his
father
and
was
beautiful
his
callow
had
not
even
had
the
advantage
of
the
war
like
nearly
everybody
else
him
small
in
his
own
eyes
that
night
from
the
balcony
of
his
bedroom
he
gazed
down
on
the
roof
of
the
if
inlaid
with
honeycomb
of
jet
ivory
and
gold
and
long
after
he
lay
awake
listening
to
the
cry
of
the
sentry
as
the
hours
struck
and
forming
in
his
head
these
lines
voice
in
the
night
crying
down
in
the
old
sleeping
spanish
city
darkened
under
her
white
stars
what
says
the
anguish
just
the
watchman
telling
his
dateless
tale
of
safety
just
a
flinging
to
the
moon
his
song
no
tis
one
deprived
whose
lover
heart
is
weeping
just
his
cry
long
the
word
deprived
seemed
to
him
cold
and
unsatisfactory
but
bereaved
was
too
final
and
no
other
word
of
two
syllables
came
to
him
which
would
enable
him
to
keep
whose
lover
heart
is
it
was
past
two
by
the
time
he
had
finished
it
and
past
three
before
he
went
to
sleep
having
said
it
over
to
himself
at
least
times
next
day
he
wrote
it
out
and
enclosed
it
in
one
of
those
letters
to
fleur
which
he
always
finished
before
he
went
down
so
as
to
have
his
mind
free
and
companionable
about
noon
that
same
day
on
the
tiled
terrace
of
their
hotel
he
felt
a
sudden
dull
pain
in
the
back
of
his
head
a
queer
sensation
in
the
eyes
and
sickness
the
sun
had
touched
him
too
affectionately
the
next
three
days
were
passed
in
and
a
dulled
aching
indifference
to
all
except
the
feel
of
ice
on
his
forehead
and
his
mother
smile
she
never
moved
from
his
room
never
relaxed
her
noiseless
vigilance
which
seemed
to
jon
angelic
but
there
were
moments
when
he
was
extremely
sorry
for
himself
and
wished
terribly
that
fleur
could
see
him
several
times
he
took
a
poignant
imaginary
leave
of
her
and
of
the
earth
tears
oozing
out
of
his
eyes
he
even
prepared
the
message
he
would
send
to
her
by
his
would
regret
to
her
dying
day
that
she
had
ever
sought
to
separate
poor
mother
he
was
not
slow
however
in
perceiving
that
he
had
now
his
excuse
for
going
home
toward
six
each
evening
came
a
gasgacha
of
cascade
of
tumbling
chimes
mounting
from
the
city
below
and
falling
back
chime
on
chime
after
listening
to
them
on
the
fourth
day
he
said
suddenly
i
like
to
be
back
in
england
mum
the
sun
too
very
well
darling
as
soon
as
you
fit
to
travel
and
at
once
he
felt
better
they
had
been
out
five
weeks
when
they
turned
toward
home
jon
head
was
restored
to
its
pristine
clarity
but
he
was
confined
to
a
hat
lined
by
his
mother
with
many
layers
of
orange
and
green
silk
and
he
still
walked
from
choice
in
the
shade
as
the
long
struggle
of
discretion
between
them
drew
to
its
close
he
wondered
more
and
more
whether
she
could
see
his
eagerness
to
get
back
to
that
which
she
had
brought
him
away
from
condemned
by
spanish
providence
to
spend
a
day
in
madrid
between
their
trains
it
was
but
natural
to
go
again
to
the
prado
jon
was
elaborately
casual
this
time
before
his
goya
girl
now
that
he
was
going
back
to
her
he
could
afford
a
lesser
scrutiny
it
was
his
mother
who
lingered
before
the
picture
saying
the
face
and
the
figure
of
the
girl
are
jon
heard
her
uneasily
did
she
understand
but
he
felt
once
more
that
he
was
no
match
for
her
in
and
subtlety
she
could
in
some
supersensitive
way
of
which
he
had
not
the
secret
feel
the
pulse
of
his
thoughts
she
knew
by
instinct
what
he
hoped
and
feared
and
wished
it
made
him
terribly
uncomfortable
and
guilty
having
beyond
most
boys
a
conscience
he
wished
she
would
be
frank
with
him
he
almost
hoped
for
an
open
struggle
but
none
came
and
steadily
silently
they
travelled
north
thus
did
he
first
learn
how
much
better
than
men
women
play
a
waiting
game
in
paris
they
had
again
to
pause
for
a
day
jon
was
grieved
because
it
lasted
two
owing
to
certain
matters
in
connection
with
a
dressmaker
as
if
his
mother
who
looked
beautiful
in
anything
had
any
need
of
dresses
the
happiest
moment
of
his
travel
was
that
when
he
stepped
on
to
the
folkestone
boat
standing
by
the
bulwark
rail
with
her
arm
in
his
she
said
i
afraid
you
have
enjoyed
it
much
jon
but
you
been
very
sweet
to
jon
squeezed
her
arm
oh
yes
i
enjoyed
it
for
my
head
and
now
that
the
end
had
come
he
really
had
feeling
a
sort
of
glamour
over
the
past
kind
of
painful
pleasure
such
as
he
had
tried
to
screw
into
those
lines
about
the
voice
in
the
night
crying
a
feeling
such
as
he
had
known
as
a
small
boy
listening
avidly
to
chopin
yet
wanting
to
cry
and
he
wondered
why
it
was
that
he
could
say
to
her
quite
simply
what
she
had
said
to
him
you
were
very
sweet
to
never
could
be
nice
and
natural
like
that
he
substituted
the
words
i
expect
we
shall
be
they
were
and
reached
london
somewhat
attenuated
having
been
away
six
weeks
and
two
days
without
a
single
allusion
to
the
subject
which
had
hardly
ever
ceased
to
occupy
their
minds
and
daughters
deprived
of
his
wife
and
son
by
the
spanish
adventure
jolyon
found
the
solitude
at
robin
hill
intolerable
a
philosopher
when
he
has
all
that
he
wants
is
different
from
a
philosopher
when
he
has
not
accustomed
however
to
the
idea
if
not
to
the
reality
of
resignation
he
would
perhaps
have
faced
it
out
but
for
his
daughter
june
he
was
a
lame
duck
now
and
on
her
conscience
having
rescue
of
an
etcher
in
low
circumstances
which
she
happened
to
have
in
hand
she
appeared
at
robin
hill
a
fortnight
after
irene
and
jon
had
gone
june
was
living
now
in
a
tiny
house
with
a
big
studio
at
chiswick
a
forsyte
of
the
best
period
so
far
as
the
lack
of
responsibility
was
concerned
she
had
overcome
the
difficulty
of
a
reduced
income
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
herself
and
her
father
the
rent
of
the
gallery
off
cork
street
which
he
had
bought
for
her
and
her
increased
income
tax
happening
to
balance
it
had
been
quite
no
longer
paid
him
the
rent
the
gallery
might
be
expected
now
at
any
time
after
eighteen
years
of
barren
usufruct
to
pay
its
way
so
that
she
was
sure
her
father
would
not
feel
it
through
this
device
she
still
had
twelve
hundred
a
year
and
by
reducing
what
she
ate
and
in
place
of
two
belgians
in
a
poor
way
employing
one
austrian
in
a
poorer
practically
the
same
surplus
for
the
relief
of
genius
after
three
days
at
robin
hill
she
carried
her
father
back
with
her
to
town
in
those
three
days
she
had
stumbled
on
the
secret
he
had
kept
for
two
years
and
had
instantly
decided
to
cure
him
she
knew
in
fact
the
very
man
he
had
done
wonders
with
paul
painter
a
little
in
advance
of
futurism
and
she
was
impatient
with
her
father
because
his
eyebrows
would
go
up
and
because
he
had
heard
of
neither
of
course
if
he
had
faith
he
would
never
get
well
it
was
absurd
not
to
have
faith
in
the
man
who
had
healed
paul
post
so
that
he
had
only
just
relapsed
from
having
overworked
or
overlived
himself
again
the
great
thing
about
this
healer
was
that
he
relied
on
nature
he
had
made
a
special
study
of
the
symptoms
of
his
patient
failed
in
any
natural
symptom
he
supplied
the
poison
which
caused
there
you
were
she
was
extremely
hopeful
her
father
had
clearly
not
been
living
a
natural
life
at
robin
hill
and
she
intended
to
provide
the
symptoms
he
of
touch
with
the
times
which
was
not
natural
his
heart
wanted
stimulating
in
the
little
chiswick
house
she
and
the
grateful
soul
so
devoted
to
june
for
rescuing
her
that
she
was
in
danger
of
decease
from
jolyon
in
all
sorts
of
ways
preparing
him
for
his
cure
but
they
could
not
keep
his
eyebrows
down
as
for
example
when
the
austrian
woke
him
at
eight
just
as
he
was
going
to
sleep
or
june
took
the
times
away
from
him
because
it
was
unnatural
to
read
that
stuff
when
he
ought
to
be
taking
an
interest
in
he
never
failed
indeed
to
be
astonished
at
her
resource
especially
in
the
evenings
for
his
benefit
as
she
declared
though
he
suspected
that
she
also
got
something
out
of
it
she
assembled
the
age
so
far
as
it
was
satellite
to
genius
and
with
some
solemnity
it
would
move
up
and
down
the
studio
before
him
in
the
and
that
more
mental
form
of
so
pulled
against
the
music
that
jolyon
eyebrows
would
be
almost
lost
in
his
hair
from
wonder
at
the
strain
it
must
impose
on
the
dancer
aware
that
hung
on
the
line
in
the
water
colour
society
he
was
a
back
number
to
those
with
any
pretension
to
be
called
artists
he
would
sit
in
the
darkest
corner
he
could
find
and
wonder
about
rhythm
on
which
so
long
ago
he
had
been
raised
and
when
june
brought
some
girl
or
young
man
up
to
him
he
would
rise
humbly
to
their
level
so
far
as
that
was
possible
and
think
me
this
is
very
dull
for
them
having
his
perennial
sympathy
with
youth
he
used
to
get
very
tired
from
entering
into
their
points
of
view
but
it
was
all
stimulating
and
he
never
failed
in
admiration
of
his
daughter
indomitable
spirit
even
genius
itself
attended
these
gatherings
now
and
then
with
its
nose
on
one
side
and
june
always
introduced
it
to
her
father
this
she
felt
was
exceptionally
good
for
him
for
genius
was
a
natural
symptom
he
had
never
as
she
was
of
him
certain
as
a
man
can
be
that
she
was
his
own
daughter
he
often
wondered
whence
she
got
hair
now
greyed
into
a
special
colour
her
direct
spirited
face
so
different
from
his
own
rather
folded
and
subtilised
countenance
her
little
lithe
figure
when
he
and
most
of
the
forsytes
were
tall
and
he
would
dwell
on
the
origin
of
species
and
debate
whether
she
might
be
danish
or
celtic
celtic
he
thought
from
her
pugnacity
and
her
taste
in
fillets
and
djibbahs
it
was
not
too
much
to
say
that
he
preferred
her
to
the
age
with
which
she
was
surrounded
youthful
though
for
the
greater
part
it
was
she
took
however
too
much
interest
in
his
teeth
for
he
still
had
some
of
those
natural
symptoms
her
dentist
at
once
found
staphylococcus
aureus
present
in
pure
culture
which
might
cause
boils
of
course
and
wanted
to
take
out
all
the
teeth
he
had
and
supply
him
with
two
complete
sets
of
unnatural
symptoms
jolyon
native
tenacity
was
roused
and
in
the
studio
that
evening
he
developed
his
objections
he
had
never
had
any
boils
and
his
own
teeth
would
last
his
time
of
would
last
his
time
if
he
did
have
them
out
but
if
he
had
more
teeth
he
would
have
a
better
heart
and
his
time
would
be
longer
his
a
symptom
of
his
whole
attitude
he
was
taking
it
lying
down
he
ought
to
be
fighting
when
was
he
going
to
see
the
man
who
had
cured
paul
post
jolyon
was
very
sorry
but
the
fact
was
he
was
not
going
to
see
him
june
chafed
healer
was
such
a
fine
man
and
he
had
such
difficulty
in
making
two
ends
meet
and
getting
his
theories
recognised
it
was
just
such
indifference
and
prejudice
as
her
father
manifested
which
was
keeping
him
back
it
would
be
so
splendid
for
both
of
them
i
perceive
said
jolyon
that
you
are
trying
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
to
cure
you
mean
cried
june
my
dear
it
the
same
june
protested
it
was
unfair
to
say
that
without
a
trial
jolyon
thought
he
might
not
have
the
chance
of
saying
it
after
dad
cried
june
you
that
said
jolyon
is
a
fact
but
i
wish
to
remain
hopeless
as
long
as
possible
i
shall
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
my
child
they
are
quiet
at
that
not
giving
science
a
chance
cried
june
you
no
idea
how
devoted
pondridge
is
he
puts
his
science
before
just
replied
jolyon
puffing
the
mild
cigarette
to
which
he
was
reduced
as
paul
post
puts
his
art
eh
art
for
art
for
the
sake
of
science
i
know
those
enthusiastic
egomaniac
gentry
they
vivisect
you
without
blinking
i
enough
of
a
forsyte
to
give
them
the
dad
said
june
if
you
only
knew
how
that
sounds
nobody
can
afford
to
be
i
afraid
murmured
jolyon
with
his
smile
that
the
only
natural
symptom
with
which
pondridge
need
not
supply
me
we
are
born
to
be
extreme
or
to
be
moderate
my
dear
though
if
you
forgive
my
saying
so
half
the
people
nowadays
who
believe
they
extreme
are
really
very
moderate
i
getting
on
as
well
as
i
can
expect
and
i
must
leave
it
at
june
was
silent
having
experienced
in
her
time
the
inexorable
character
of
her
father
amiable
obstinacy
so
far
as
his
own
freedom
of
action
was
concerned
how
he
came
to
let
her
know
why
irene
had
taken
jon
to
spain
puzzled
jolyon
for
he
had
little
confidence
in
her
discretion
after
she
had
brooded
on
the
news
it
brought
a
rather
sharp
discussion
during
which
he
perceived
to
the
full
the
fundamental
opposition
between
her
active
temperament
and
his
wife
passivity
he
even
gathered
that
a
little
soreness
still
remained
from
that
struggle
between
them
over
the
body
of
philip
bosinney
in
which
the
passive
had
so
signally
triumphed
over
the
active
principle
according
to
june
it
was
foolish
and
even
cowardly
to
hide
the
past
from
jon
sheer
opportunism
she
called
it
which
jolyon
put
in
mildly
is
the
working
principle
of
real
life
my
oh
cried
june
you
do
really
defend
her
for
not
telling
jon
dad
if
it
were
left
to
you
you
i
might
but
simply
because
i
know
he
must
find
out
which
will
be
worse
than
if
we
told
then
why
do
you
tell
him
it
just
sleeping
dogs
my
dear
said
jolyon
i
would
for
the
world
go
against
instinct
he
her
yours
too
cried
june
what
is
a
man
instinct
compared
with
a
mother
well
i
think
it
very
weak
of
i
dare
say
said
jolyon
i
dare
and
that
was
all
she
got
from
him
but
the
matter
rankled
in
her
brain
she
could
not
bear
sleeping
dogs
and
there
stirred
in
her
a
tortuous
impulse
to
push
the
matter
toward
decision
jon
ought
to
be
told
so
that
either
his
feeling
might
be
nipped
in
the
bud
or
flowering
in
spite
of
the
past
come
to
fruition
and
she
determined
to
see
fleur
and
judge
for
herself
when
june
determined
on
anything
delicacy
became
a
somewhat
minor
consideration
after
all
she
was
soames
cousin
and
they
were
both
interested
in
pictures
she
would
go
and
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
buy
a
paul
post
or
perhaps
a
piece
of
sculpture
by
boris
strumolowski
and
of
course
she
would
say
nothing
to
her
father
she
went
on
the
following
sunday
looking
so
determined
that
she
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
a
cab
at
reading
station
the
river
country
was
lovely
in
those
days
of
her
own
month
and
june
ached
at
its
loveliness
she
who
had
passed
through
this
life
without
knowing
what
union
was
had
a
love
of
natural
beauty
which
was
almost
madness
and
when
she
came
to
that
choice
spot
where
soames
had
pitched
his
tent
she
dismissed
her
cab
because
business
over
she
wanted
to
revel
in
the
bright
water
and
the
woods
she
appeared
at
his
front
door
therefore
as
a
mere
pedestrian
and
sent
in
her
card
it
was
in
june
character
to
know
that
when
her
nerves
were
fluttering
she
was
doing
something
worth
while
if
one
nerves
did
not
flutter
she
was
taking
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
knew
that
nobleness
was
not
obliging
her
she
was
conducted
to
a
which
though
not
in
her
style
showed
every
mark
of
fastidious
elegance
thinking
much
many
she
saw
in
an
old
mirror
the
figure
of
a
girl
coming
in
from
the
verandah
clothed
in
white
and
holding
some
white
roses
in
her
hand
she
had
reflected
in
that
pool
of
glass
a
appearance
as
if
a
pretty
ghost
had
come
out
of
the
green
garden
how
do
you
do
said
june
turning
round
i
a
cousin
of
your
oh
yes
i
saw
you
in
that
with
my
young
stepbrother
is
your
father
in
he
will
be
directly
he
only
gone
for
a
little
june
slightly
narrowed
her
blue
eyes
and
lifted
her
decided
chin
your
name
fleur
is
it
i
heard
of
you
from
holly
what
do
you
think
of
jon
the
girl
lifted
the
roses
in
her
hand
looked
at
them
and
answered
calmly
he
quite
a
nice
not
a
bit
like
holly
or
me
is
he
not
a
cool
thought
june
and
suddenly
the
girl
said
i
wish
you
tell
me
why
our
families
get
on
confronted
with
the
question
she
had
advised
her
father
to
answer
june
was
silent
whether
because
this
girl
was
trying
to
get
something
out
of
her
or
simply
because
what
one
would
do
theoretically
is
not
always
what
one
will
do
when
it
comes
to
the
point
you
know
said
the
girl
the
surest
way
to
make
people
find
out
the
worst
is
to
keep
them
ignorant
my
father
told
me
it
was
a
quarrel
about
property
but
i
do
believe
it
we
both
got
heaps
they
would
have
been
so
bourgeois
as
all
june
flushed
the
word
applied
to
her
grandfather
and
father
offended
her
my
grandfather
she
said
was
very
generous
and
my
father
is
too
neither
of
them
was
in
the
least
well
what
was
it
then
repeated
the
girl
conscious
that
this
young
forsyte
meant
having
what
she
wanted
june
at
once
determined
to
prevent
her
and
to
get
something
for
herself
instead
why
do
you
want
to
know
the
girl
smelled
at
her
roses
i
only
want
to
know
because
they
tell
well
it
was
about
property
but
there
more
than
one
that
makes
it
worse
now
i
really
must
june
small
and
resolute
face
quivered
she
was
wearing
a
round
cap
and
her
hair
had
fluffed
out
under
it
she
looked
quite
young
at
that
moment
rejuvenated
by
encounter
you
know
she
said
i
saw
you
drop
your
handkerchief
is
there
anything
between
you
and
jon
because
if
so
you
better
drop
that
the
girl
grew
paler
but
she
smiled
if
there
were
that
is
the
way
to
make
at
the
gallantry
of
that
reply
june
held
out
her
hand
i
like
you
but
i
do
like
your
father
i
never
have
we
may
as
well
be
did
you
come
down
to
tell
him
that
june
laughed
no
i
came
down
to
see
how
delightful
of
this
girl
could
fence
i
two
and
a
half
times
your
age
said
june
but
i
quite
sympathize
it
horrid
not
to
have
one
own
the
girl
smiled
again
i
really
think
you
might
tell
how
the
child
stuck
to
her
point
it
not
my
secret
but
i
see
what
i
can
do
because
i
think
both
you
and
jon
ought
to
be
told
and
now
i
say
wo
you
wait
and
see
father
june
shook
her
head
how
can
i
get
over
to
the
other
side
i
row
you
look
said
june
impulsively
next
time
you
in
london
come
and
see
me
this
is
where
i
live
i
generally
have
young
people
in
the
evening
but
i
should
tell
your
father
that
you
the
girl
nodded
watching
her
scull
the
skiff
across
june
thought
awfully
pretty
and
well
made
i
never
thought
soames
would
have
a
daughter
as
pretty
as
this
she
and
jon
would
make
a
lovely
couple
the
instinct
to
couple
starved
within
herself
was
always
at
work
in
june
she
stood
watching
fleur
row
back
the
girl
took
her
hand
off
a
scull
to
wave
farewell
and
june
walked
languidly
on
between
the
meadows
and
the
river
with
an
ache
in
her
heart
youth
to
youth
like
the
chasing
each
other
and
love
like
the
sun
warming
them
through
and
through
her
youth
so
long
phil
and
since
one
had
been
quite
what
she
had
wanted
and
so
she
had
missed
it
all
but
what
a
coil
was
round
those
two
young
things
if
they
really
were
in
love
as
holly
would
have
her
father
and
irene
and
soames
himself
seemed
to
dread
what
a
coil
and
what
a
barrier
and
the
itch
for
the
future
the
contempt
as
it
were
for
what
was
overpast
which
forms
the
active
principle
moved
in
the
heart
of
one
who
ever
believed
that
what
one
wanted
was
more
important
than
what
other
people
did
not
want
from
the
bank
awhile
in
the
warm
summer
stillness
she
watched
the
plants
and
willow
leaves
the
fishes
rising
sniffed
the
scent
of
grass
and
wondering
how
she
could
force
everybody
to
be
happy
jon
and
fleur
two
little
lame
callow
yellow
little
ducks
a
great
pity
surely
something
could
be
done
one
must
not
take
such
situations
lying
down
she
walked
on
and
reached
a
station
hot
and
cross
that
evening
faithful
to
the
impulse
toward
direct
action
which
made
many
people
avoid
her
she
said
to
her
father
dad
i
been
down
to
see
young
fleur
i
think
she
very
attractive
it
no
good
hiding
our
heads
under
our
wings
is
it
the
startled
jolyon
set
down
his
and
began
crumbling
his
bread
it
what
you
appear
to
be
doing
he
said
do
you
realise
whose
daughter
she
is
ca
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
jolyon
rose
certain
things
can
never
be
i
disagree
said
june
it
that
which
stands
in
the
way
of
all
happiness
and
progress
you
do
understand
the
age
dad
it
got
no
use
for
outgrown
things
why
do
you
think
it
matters
so
terribly
that
jon
should
know
about
his
mother
who
pays
any
attention
to
that
sort
of
thing
now
the
marriage
laws
are
just
as
they
were
when
soames
and
irene
could
get
a
divorce
and
you
had
to
come
in
we
moved
and
they
have
so
nobody
cares
marriage
without
a
decent
chance
of
relief
is
only
a
sort
of
people
ought
to
own
each
other
everybody
sees
that
now
if
irene
broke
such
laws
what
does
it
matter
it
not
for
me
to
disagree
there
said
jolyon
but
that
all
quite
beside
the
mark
this
is
a
matter
of
human
of
course
it
is
cried
june
the
human
feeling
of
those
two
young
my
dear
said
jolyon
with
gentle
exasperation
you
talking
i
not
if
they
prove
to
be
really
fond
of
each
other
why
should
they
be
made
unhappy
because
of
the
past
you
have
lived
that
past
i
the
feelings
of
my
wife
through
my
own
nerves
and
my
imagination
as
only
one
who
is
devoted
june
too
rose
and
began
to
wander
restlessly
if
she
said
suddenly
she
were
the
daughter
of
philip
bosinney
i
could
understand
you
better
irene
loved
him
she
never
loved
jolyon
uttered
a
deep
sort
of
noise
an
italian
peasant
woman
utters
to
her
mule
his
heart
had
begun
beating
furiously
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
quite
carried
away
by
his
feelings
that
shows
how
little
you
understand
neither
i
nor
jon
if
i
know
him
would
mind
a
it
the
brutality
of
a
union
without
love
this
girl
is
the
daughter
of
the
man
who
once
owned
jon
mother
as
a
was
owned
you
ca
lay
that
ghost
do
try
to
june
it
asking
us
to
see
jon
joined
to
the
flesh
and
blood
of
the
man
who
possessed
jon
mother
against
her
will
it
no
good
mincing
words
i
want
it
clear
once
for
all
and
now
i
must
talk
any
more
or
i
shall
have
to
sit
up
with
this
all
and
putting
his
hand
over
his
heart
jolyon
turned
his
back
on
his
daughter
and
stood
looking
at
the
river
thames
june
who
by
nature
never
saw
a
hornet
nest
until
she
had
put
her
head
into
it
was
seriously
alarmed
she
came
and
slipped
her
arm
through
his
not
convinced
that
he
was
right
and
she
herself
wrong
because
that
was
not
natural
to
her
she
was
yet
profoundly
impressed
by
the
obvious
fact
that
the
subject
was
very
bad
for
him
she
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
and
said
nothing
after
taking
her
elderly
cousin
across
fleur
did
not
land
at
once
but
pulled
in
among
the
reeds
into
the
sunshine
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
afternoon
seduced
for
a
little
one
not
much
given
to
the
vague
and
poetic
in
the
field
beyond
the
bank
where
her
skiff
lay
up
a
machine
drawn
by
a
grey
horse
was
turning
an
early
field
of
hay
she
watched
the
grass
cascading
over
and
behind
the
light
wheels
with
looked
so
cool
and
fresh
the
click
and
swish
blended
with
the
rustle
of
the
willows
and
the
poplars
and
the
cooing
of
a
in
a
true
river
song
alongside
in
the
deep
green
water
weeds
like
yellow
snakes
were
writhing
and
nosing
with
the
current
pied
cattle
on
the
farther
side
stood
in
the
shade
lazily
swishing
their
tails
it
was
an
afternoon
to
dream
and
she
took
out
jon
flowery
effusions
but
haunted
in
their
recital
of
things
seen
and
done
by
a
longing
very
agreeable
to
her
and
all
ending
your
devoted
fleur
was
not
sentimental
her
desires
were
ever
concrete
and
concentrated
but
what
poetry
there
was
in
the
daughter
of
soames
and
annette
had
certainly
in
those
weeks
of
waiting
gathered
round
her
memories
of
jon
they
all
belonged
to
grass
and
blossom
flowers
and
running
water
she
enjoyed
him
in
the
scents
absorbed
by
her
crinkling
nose
the
stars
could
persuade
her
that
she
was
standing
beside
him
in
the
centre
of
the
map
of
spain
and
of
an
early
morning
the
dewy
cobwebs
the
hazy
sparkle
and
promise
of
the
day
down
in
the
garden
were
jon
personified
to
her
two
white
swans
came
majestically
by
while
she
was
reading
his
letters
followed
by
their
brood
of
six
young
swans
in
a
line
with
just
so
much
water
between
each
tail
and
head
a
flotilla
of
grey
destroyers
fleur
thrust
her
letters
back
got
out
her
sculls
and
pulled
up
to
the
crossing
the
lawn
she
wondered
whether
she
should
tell
her
father
of
june
visit
if
he
learned
of
it
from
the
butler
he
might
think
it
odd
if
she
did
not
it
gave
her
too
another
chance
to
startle
out
of
him
the
reason
of
the
feud
she
went
therefore
up
the
road
to
meet
him
soames
had
gone
to
look
at
a
patch
of
ground
on
which
the
local
authorities
were
proposing
to
erect
a
sanatorium
for
people
with
weak
lungs
faithful
to
his
native
individualism
he
took
no
part
in
local
affairs
content
to
pay
the
rates
which
were
always
going
up
he
could
not
however
remain
indifferent
to
this
new
and
dangerous
scheme
the
site
was
not
half
a
mile
from
his
own
house
he
was
quite
of
opinion
that
the
country
should
stamp
out
tuberculosis
but
this
was
not
the
place
it
should
be
done
farther
away
he
took
indeed
an
attitude
common
to
all
true
forsytes
that
disability
of
any
sort
in
other
people
was
not
his
affair
and
the
state
should
do
its
business
without
prejudicing
in
any
way
the
natural
advantages
which
he
had
acquired
or
inherited
francie
the
most
forsyte
of
his
generation
except
perhaps
that
fellow
jolyon
had
once
asked
him
in
her
malicious
way
did
you
ever
see
the
name
forsyte
in
a
subscription
list
soames
that
was
as
it
might
be
but
a
sanatorium
would
depreciate
the
neighbourhood
and
he
should
certainly
sign
the
petition
which
was
being
got
up
against
it
returning
with
this
decision
fresh
within
him
he
saw
fleur
coming
she
was
showing
him
more
affection
of
late
and
the
quiet
time
down
here
with
her
in
this
summer
weather
had
been
making
him
feel
quite
young
annette
was
always
running
up
to
town
for
one
thing
or
another
so
that
he
had
fleur
to
himself
almost
as
much
as
he
could
wish
to
be
sure
young
mont
had
formed
a
habit
of
appearing
on
his
almost
every
other
day
thank
goodness
the
young
fellow
had
shaved
off
his
and
no
longer
looked
like
a
mountebank
with
a
girl
friend
of
fleur
who
was
staying
in
the
house
and
a
neighbouring
youth
or
so
they
made
two
couples
after
dinner
in
the
hall
to
the
music
of
the
electric
pianola
which
performed
unassisted
with
a
surprised
shine
on
its
expressive
surface
annette
even
now
and
then
passed
gracefully
up
and
down
in
the
arms
of
one
or
other
of
the
young
men
and
soames
coming
to
the
door
would
lift
his
nose
a
little
sideways
and
watch
them
waiting
to
catch
a
smile
from
fleur
then
move
back
to
his
chair
by
the
hearth
to
peruse
the
times
or
some
other
collector
price
list
to
his
eyes
fleur
showed
no
signs
of
remembering
that
caprice
of
hers
when
she
reached
him
on
the
dusty
road
he
slipped
his
hand
within
her
arm
who
do
you
think
has
been
to
see
you
dad
she
could
wait
guess
i
never
guess
said
soames
uneasily
who
your
cousin
june
quite
unconsciously
soames
gripped
her
arm
what
did
she
want
i
do
know
but
it
was
rather
breaking
through
the
feud
was
it
feud
what
feud
the
one
that
exists
in
your
imagination
soames
dropped
her
arm
was
she
mocking
or
trying
to
draw
him
on
i
suppose
she
wanted
me
to
buy
a
picture
he
said
at
last
i
do
think
so
perhaps
it
was
just
family
she
only
a
first
cousin
once
removed
muttered
soames
and
the
daughter
of
your
what
mean
by
that
i
beg
your
pardon
dear
i
thought
he
enemy
repeated
soames
it
ancient
history
i
do
know
where
you
get
your
from
june
it
had
come
to
her
as
an
inspiration
that
if
he
thought
she
knew
or
were
on
the
edge
of
knowledge
he
would
tell
her
soames
was
startled
but
she
had
underrated
his
caution
and
tenacity
if
you
know
he
said
coldly
why
do
you
plague
me
fleur
saw
that
she
had
overreached
herself
i
do
want
to
plague
you
darling
as
you
say
why
want
to
know
more
why
want
to
know
anything
of
that
fiche
as
profond
says
that
chap
said
soames
profoundly
that
chap
indeed
played
a
considerable
if
invisible
part
this
he
had
not
turned
up
again
ever
since
the
sunday
when
fleur
had
drawn
attention
to
him
prowling
on
the
lawn
soames
had
thought
of
him
a
good
deal
and
always
in
connection
with
annette
for
no
reason
except
that
she
was
looking
handsomer
than
for
some
time
past
his
possessive
instinct
subtle
less
formal
more
elastic
since
the
war
kept
all
misgiving
underground
as
one
looks
on
some
american
river
quiet
and
pleasant
knowing
that
an
alligator
perhaps
is
lying
in
the
mud
with
his
snout
just
raised
and
indistinguishable
from
a
snag
of
soames
looked
on
the
river
of
his
own
existence
subconscious
of
monsieur
profond
refusing
to
see
more
than
the
suspicion
of
his
snout
he
had
at
this
epoch
in
his
life
practically
all
he
wanted
and
was
as
nearly
happy
as
his
nature
would
permit
his
senses
were
at
rest
his
affections
found
all
the
vent
they
needed
in
his
daughter
his
collection
was
well
known
his
money
well
invested
his
health
excellent
save
for
a
touch
of
liver
now
and
again
he
had
not
yet
begun
to
worry
seriously
about
what
would
happen
after
death
inclining
to
think
that
nothing
would
happen
he
resembled
one
of
his
own
securities
and
to
knock
the
gilt
off
by
seeing
anything
he
could
avoid
seeing
would
be
he
felt
instinctively
perverse
and
retrogressive
those
two
crumpled
fleur
caprice
and
monsieur
snout
would
level
away
if
he
lay
on
them
industriously
that
evening
chance
which
visits
the
lives
of
even
the
forsytes
put
a
clue
into
fleur
hands
her
father
came
down
to
dinner
without
a
handkerchief
and
had
occasion
to
blow
his
nose
i
get
you
one
dear
she
had
said
and
ran
upstairs
in
the
sachet
where
she
sought
for
old
sachet
of
very
faded
were
two
compartments
one
held
handkerchiefs
the
other
was
buttoned
and
contained
something
flat
and
hard
by
some
childish
impulse
fleur
unbuttoned
it
there
was
a
frame
and
in
it
a
photograph
of
herself
as
a
little
girl
she
gazed
at
it
fascinated
as
one
is
by
one
own
presentment
it
slipped
under
her
fidgeting
thumb
and
she
saw
that
another
photograph
was
behind
she
pressed
her
own
down
further
and
perceived
a
face
which
she
seemed
to
know
of
a
young
woman
very
in
a
very
old
style
of
evening
dress
slipping
her
own
photograph
up
over
it
again
she
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
went
down
only
on
the
stairs
did
she
identify
that
face
mother
the
conviction
came
as
a
shock
and
she
stood
still
in
a
flurry
of
thought
why
of
course
jon
father
had
married
the
woman
her
father
had
wanted
to
marry
had
cheated
him
out
of
her
perhaps
then
afraid
of
showing
by
her
manner
that
she
had
lighted
on
his
secret
she
refused
to
think
further
and
shaking
out
the
silk
handkerchief
entered
the
i
chose
the
softest
h
said
soames
i
only
use
those
after
a
cold
never
mind
that
evening
passed
for
fleur
in
putting
two
and
two
together
recalling
the
look
on
her
father
face
in
the
confectioner
look
strange
and
coldly
intimate
a
queer
look
he
must
have
loved
that
woman
very
much
to
have
kept
her
photograph
all
this
time
in
spite
of
having
lost
her
unsparing
and
her
mind
darted
to
his
relations
with
her
own
mother
had
he
ever
really
loved
her
she
thought
not
jon
was
the
son
of
the
woman
he
had
really
loved
surely
then
he
ought
not
to
mind
his
daughter
loving
him
it
only
wanted
getting
used
to
and
a
sigh
of
sheer
relief
was
caught
in
the
folds
of
her
nightgown
slipping
over
her
head
youth
only
recognises
age
by
fits
and
starts
jon
for
one
had
never
really
seen
his
father
age
till
he
came
back
from
spain
the
face
of
the
fourth
jolyon
worn
by
waiting
gave
him
quite
a
looked
so
wan
and
old
his
father
mask
had
been
forced
awry
by
the
emotion
of
the
meeting
so
that
the
boy
suddenly
realised
how
much
he
must
have
felt
their
absence
he
summoned
to
his
aid
the
thought
i
want
to
go
it
was
out
of
date
for
youth
to
defer
to
age
but
jon
was
by
no
means
typically
modern
his
father
had
always
been
so
jolly
to
him
and
to
feel
that
one
meant
to
begin
again
at
once
the
conduct
which
his
father
had
suffered
six
weeks
loneliness
to
cure
was
not
agreeable
at
the
question
well
old
man
how
did
the
great
goya
strike
you
his
conscience
pricked
him
badly
the
great
goya
only
existed
because
he
had
created
a
face
which
resembled
fleur
on
the
night
of
their
return
he
went
to
bed
full
of
compunction
but
awoke
full
of
anticipation
it
was
only
the
fifth
of
july
and
no
meeting
was
fixed
with
fleur
until
the
ninth
he
was
to
have
three
days
at
home
before
going
back
to
farm
somehow
he
must
contrive
to
see
her
in
the
lives
of
men
an
inexorable
rhythm
caused
by
the
need
for
trousers
not
even
the
fondest
parents
can
deny
on
the
second
day
therefore
jon
went
to
town
and
having
satisfied
his
conscience
by
ordering
what
was
indispensable
in
conduit
street
turned
his
face
toward
piccadilly
stratton
street
where
her
club
was
adjoined
devonshire
house
it
would
be
the
merest
chance
that
she
should
be
at
her
club
but
he
dawdled
down
bond
street
with
a
beating
heart
noticing
the
superiority
of
all
other
young
men
to
himself
they
wore
their
clothes
with
such
an
air
they
had
assurance
they
were
old
he
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
the
conviction
that
fleur
must
have
forgotten
him
absorbed
in
his
own
feeling
for
her
all
these
weeks
he
had
mislaid
that
possibility
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooped
his
hands
felt
clammy
fleur
with
the
pick
of
youth
at
the
beck
of
her
incomparable
it
was
an
evil
moment
jon
however
had
a
great
idea
that
one
must
be
able
to
face
anything
and
he
braced
himself
with
that
dour
reflection
in
front
of
a
shop
at
this
mark
of
what
was
once
the
london
season
there
was
nothing
to
mark
it
out
from
any
other
except
a
grey
top
hat
or
two
and
the
sun
jon
moved
on
and
turning
the
corner
into
piccadilly
ran
into
val
dartie
moving
toward
the
iseeum
club
to
which
he
had
just
been
elected
hallo
young
man
where
are
you
off
to
jon
gushed
i
just
been
to
my
val
looked
him
up
and
down
that
good
i
going
in
here
to
order
some
cigarettes
then
come
and
have
some
jon
thanked
him
he
might
get
news
of
her
from
val
the
condition
of
england
that
nightmare
of
its
press
and
public
men
was
seen
in
different
perspective
within
the
tobacconist
which
they
now
entered
yes
sir
precisely
the
cigarette
i
used
to
supply
your
father
with
bless
me
montague
dartie
was
a
customer
here
me
year
melton
won
the
derby
one
of
my
very
best
customers
he
a
faint
smile
illumined
the
tobacconist
face
many
the
tip
he
given
me
to
be
sure
i
suppose
he
took
a
couple
of
hundred
of
these
every
week
year
in
year
out
and
never
changed
his
cigarette
very
affable
gentleman
brought
me
a
lot
of
custom
i
was
sorry
he
met
with
that
accident
one
misses
an
old
customer
like
val
smiled
his
father
decease
had
closed
an
account
which
had
been
running
longer
probably
than
any
other
and
in
a
ring
of
smoke
puffed
out
from
that
cigarette
he
seemed
to
see
again
his
father
face
dark
moustachioed
a
little
puffy
in
the
only
halo
it
had
earned
his
father
had
his
fame
here
man
who
smoked
two
hundred
cigarettes
a
week
who
could
give
tips
and
run
accounts
for
ever
to
his
tobacconist
a
hero
even
that
was
some
distinction
to
inherit
i
pay
cash
he
said
how
much
to
his
son
sir
and
and
six
i
shall
never
forget
montague
dartie
i
known
him
stand
talkin
to
me
half
an
hour
we
do
get
many
like
him
now
with
everybody
in
such
a
hurry
the
war
was
bad
for
manners
was
bad
for
manners
you
were
in
it
i
no
said
val
tapping
his
knee
i
got
this
in
the
war
before
saved
my
life
i
expect
do
you
want
any
cigarettes
jon
rather
ashamed
jon
murmured
i
do
smoke
you
know
and
saw
the
tobacconist
lips
twisted
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
say
good
god
or
now
your
chance
sir
that
right
said
val
keep
off
it
while
you
can
you
want
it
when
you
take
a
knock
this
is
really
the
same
tobacco
then
identical
sir
a
little
dearer
that
all
wonderful
staying
british
empire
i
always
send
me
down
a
hundred
a
week
to
this
address
and
invoice
it
monthly
come
on
jon
entered
the
iseeum
with
curiosity
except
to
lunch
now
and
then
at
the
with
his
father
he
had
never
been
in
a
london
club
the
iseeum
comfortable
and
unpretentious
did
not
move
could
not
so
long
as
george
forsyte
sat
on
its
committee
where
his
culinary
acumen
was
almost
the
controlling
force
the
club
had
made
a
stand
against
the
newly
rich
and
it
had
taken
all
george
forsyte
prestige
and
praise
of
him
as
a
good
sportsman
to
bring
in
prosper
profond
the
two
were
lunching
together
when
the
entered
the
and
attracted
by
george
forefinger
sat
down
at
their
table
val
with
his
shrewd
eyes
and
charming
smile
jon
with
solemn
lips
and
an
attractive
shyness
in
his
glance
there
was
an
air
of
privilege
around
that
corner
table
as
though
past
masters
were
eating
there
jon
was
fascinated
by
the
hypnotic
atmosphere
the
waiter
lean
in
the
chaps
pervaded
with
such
deference
he
seemed
to
hang
on
george
forsyte
lips
to
watch
the
gloat
in
his
eye
with
a
kind
of
sympathy
to
follow
the
movements
of
the
heavy
silver
fondly
his
liveried
arm
and
confidential
voice
alarmed
jon
they
came
so
secretly
over
his
shoulder
except
for
george
your
grandfather
tipped
me
once
he
was
a
deuced
good
judge
of
a
cigar
neither
he
nor
the
other
past
master
took
any
notice
of
him
and
he
was
grateful
for
this
the
talk
was
all
about
the
breeding
points
and
prices
of
horses
and
he
listened
to
it
vaguely
at
first
wondering
how
it
was
possible
to
retain
so
much
knowledge
in
a
head
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
dark
past
he
said
was
so
deliberate
and
heavy
queer
words
jon
was
thinking
of
butterflies
when
he
heard
him
say
i
want
to
see
soames
forsyde
take
an
interest
in
old
soames
he
too
dry
a
file
with
all
his
might
jon
tried
not
to
grow
red
while
the
dark
past
master
went
on
his
daughter
an
attractive
small
girl
soames
forsyde
is
a
bit
i
want
to
see
him
have
a
pleasure
some
george
forsyte
grinned
do
you
worry
he
not
so
miserable
as
he
looks
he
never
show
he
enjoying
might
try
and
take
it
from
him
old
soames
once
bit
twice
shy
well
jon
said
val
hastily
if
you
finished
we
go
and
have
who
were
those
jon
asked
on
the
stairs
i
did
old
george
forsyte
is
a
first
cousin
of
your
father
and
of
my
uncle
soames
he
always
been
here
the
other
chap
profond
is
a
queer
fish
i
think
he
hanging
round
soames
wife
if
you
ask
me
jon
looked
at
him
startled
but
that
awful
he
said
i
do
suppose
fleur
cares
very
much
she
very
her
mother
you
very
green
jon
grew
red
mothers
he
stammered
angrily
are
you
right
said
val
suddenly
but
things
are
what
they
were
when
i
was
your
age
there
a
we
die
feeling
what
old
george
meant
about
my
uncle
soames
he
does
mean
to
die
jon
said
quickly
what
the
matter
between
him
and
my
father
stable
secret
jon
take
my
advice
and
bottle
up
you
do
no
good
by
knowing
have
a
liqueur
jon
shook
his
head
i
hate
the
way
people
keep
things
from
one
he
muttered
and
then
sneer
at
one
for
being
well
you
can
ask
holly
if
she
wo
tell
you
you
believe
it
for
your
own
good
i
jon
got
up
i
must
go
now
thanks
awfully
for
the
val
smiled
up
at
him
and
yet
amused
the
boy
looked
so
upset
all
right
see
you
on
i
do
know
murmured
jon
and
he
did
not
this
conspiracy
of
silence
made
him
desperate
it
was
humiliating
to
be
treated
like
a
child
he
retraced
his
moody
steps
to
stratton
street
but
he
would
go
to
her
club
now
and
find
out
the
worst
to
his
enquiry
the
reply
was
that
miss
forsyte
was
not
in
the
club
she
might
be
in
perhaps
later
she
was
often
in
on
could
not
say
jon
said
he
would
call
again
and
crossing
into
the
green
park
flung
himself
down
under
a
tree
the
sun
was
bright
and
a
breeze
fluttered
the
leaves
of
the
young
beneath
which
he
lay
but
his
heart
ached
such
darkness
seemed
gathered
round
his
happiness
he
heard
big
ben
chime
three
above
the
traffic
the
sound
moved
something
in
him
and
taking
out
a
piece
of
paper
he
began
to
scribble
on
it
with
a
pencil
he
had
jotted
a
stanza
and
was
searching
the
grass
for
another
verse
when
something
hard
touched
his
green
parasol
there
above
him
stood
fleur
they
told
me
you
been
and
were
coming
back
so
i
thought
you
might
be
out
here
and
you
rather
wonderful
oh
fleur
i
thought
you
have
forgotten
when
i
told
you
that
i
should
jon
seized
her
arm
it
too
much
luck
let
get
away
from
this
he
almost
dragged
her
on
through
that
too
thoughtfully
regulated
park
to
find
some
cover
where
they
could
sit
and
hold
each
other
hands
has
anybody
cut
in
he
said
gazing
round
at
her
lashes
in
suspense
above
her
cheeks
there
is
a
young
idiot
but
he
does
jon
felt
a
twitch
of
compassion
for
idiot
you
know
i
had
sunstroke
i
did
tell
really
was
it
interesting
no
mother
was
an
angel
has
anything
happened
to
you
nothing
except
that
i
think
i
found
out
what
wrong
between
our
families
his
heart
began
beating
very
fast
i
believe
my
father
wanted
to
marry
your
mother
and
your
father
got
her
oh
i
came
on
a
photo
of
her
it
was
in
a
frame
behind
a
photo
of
me
of
course
if
he
was
very
fond
of
her
that
would
have
made
him
pretty
mad
would
it
jon
thought
for
a
minute
not
if
she
loved
my
father
but
suppose
they
were
engaged
if
we
were
engaged
and
you
found
you
loved
somebody
better
i
might
go
cracked
but
i
should
grudge
it
i
should
you
must
ever
do
that
with
me
jon
my
god
not
much
i
do
believe
that
he
ever
really
cared
for
my
jon
was
silent
val
two
past
masters
in
the
club
you
see
we
do
know
went
on
fleur
it
may
have
been
a
great
shock
she
may
have
behaved
badly
to
him
people
my
mother
fleur
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
think
we
know
much
about
our
fathers
and
mothers
we
just
see
them
in
the
light
of
the
way
they
treat

but

treated
other
people

know
before
we
were
i
expect
you
see
they
both
old
look
at
your
father
with
three
separate
families

place

in
all
this
beastly
london
where

can
be
alone
only
a
let
get
one
when
they
were
installed

asked
suddenly

back
to
robin
hill
i
should
like
to
see
where
you

jon
i
staying
with
my
aunt
for
the
night
but
i
could
get
back
in
time
for
dinner
i
would
come
to
the
house
of
jon
gazed
at
her
enraptured
splendid
i
can
show
it
you
from
the
copse
we
sha
meet
anybody
there
a
train
at
the
god
of
property
and
his
forsytes
great
and
small
leisured
official
commercial
or
professional
like
the
working
classes
still
worked
their
seven
hours
a
day
so
that
those
two
of
the
fourth
generation
travelled
down
to
robin
hill
in
an
empty
carriage
dusty
and
of
that
too
early
train
they
travelled
in
blissful
silence
holding
each
other
hands
at
the
station
they
saw
no
one
except
porters
and
a
villager
or
two
unknown
to
jon
and
walked
out
up
the
lane
which
smelled
of
dust
and
honeysuckle
for
of
her
now
and
without
separation
before
was
a
miraculous
dawdle
more
wonderful
than
those
on
the
downs
or
along
the
river
thames
it
was
of
those
illumined
pages
of
life
where
every
word
and
smile
and
every
light
touch
they
gave
each
other
were
as
little
gold
and
red
and
blue
butterflies
and
flowers
and
birds
scrolled
in
among
the
happy
communing
without
afterthought
which
lasted
minutes
they
reached
the
coppice
at
the
milking
hour
jon
would
not
take
her
as
far
as
the
farmyard
only
to
where
she
could
see
the
field
leading
up
to
the
gardens
and
the
house
beyond
they
turned
in
among
the
larches
and
suddenly
at
the
winding
of
the
path
came
on
irene
sitting
on
an
old
log
seat
there
are
various
kinds
of
shocks
to
the
vertebrae
to
the
nerves
to
moral
sensibility
and
more
potent
and
permanent
to
personal
dignity
this
last
was
the
shock
jon
received
coming
thus
on
his
mother
he
became
suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
doing
an
indelicate
thing
to
have
brought
fleur
down
but
to
sneak
her
in
like
this
consumed
with
shame
he
put
on
a
front
as
brazen
as
his
nature
would
permit
fleur
was
smiling
a
little
defiantly
his
mother
startled
face
was
changing
quickly
to
the
impersonal
and
gracious
it
was
she
who
uttered
the
first
words
i
very
glad
to
see
you
it
was
nice
of
jon
to
think
of
bringing
you
down
to
we
were
coming
to
the
house
jon
blurted
out
i
just
wanted
fleur
to
see
where
i
his
mother
said
quietly
wo
you
come
up
and
have
tea
feeling
that
he
had
but
aggravated
his
breach
of
breeding
he
heard
fleur
answer
thanks
very
much
i
have
to
get
back
to
dinner
i
met
jon
by
accident
and
we
thought
it
would
be
rather
jolly
just
to
see
his
how
she
was
of
course
but
you
must
have
tea
we
send
you
down
to
the
station
my
husband
will
enjoy
seeing
the
expression
of
his
mother
eyes
resting
on
him
for
a
moment
cast
jon
down
level
with
the
true
worm
then
she
led
on
and
fleur
followed
her
he
felt
like
a
child
trailing
after
those
two
who
were
talking
so
easily
about
spain
and
wansdon
and
the
house
up
there
beyond
the
trees
and
the
grassy
slope
he
watched
the
fencing
of
their
eyes
taking
each
other
two
beings
he
loved
most
in
the
world
he
could
see
his
father
sitting
under
the
oaktree
and
suffered
in
advance
all
the
loss
of
caste
he
must
go
through
in
the
eyes
of
that
tranquil
figure
with
his
knees
crossed
thin
old
and
elegant
already
he
could
feel
the
faint
irony
which
would
come
into
his
voice
and
smile
this
is
fleur
forsyte
jolyon
jon
brought
her
down
to
see
the
house
let
have
tea
at
has
to
catch
a
train
jon
tell
them
dear
and
telephone
to
the
dragon
for
a
to
leave
her
alone
with
them
was
strange
and
yet
as
no
doubt
his
mother
had
foreseen
the
least
of
evils
at
the
moment
so
he
ran
up
into
the
house
now
he
would
not
see
fleur
alone
for
a
minute
and
they
had
arranged
no
further
meeting
when
he
returned
under
cover
of
the
maids
and
teapots
there
was
not
a
trace
of
awkwardness
beneath
the
tree
it
was
all
within
himself
but
not
the
less
for
that
they
were
talking
of
the
gallery
off
cork
street
we
back
numbers
his
father
was
saying
are
awfully
anxious
to
find
out
why
we
ca
appreciate
the
new
stuff
you
and
jon
must
tell
it
supposed
to
be
satiric
is
it
said
fleur
he
saw
his
father
smile
satiric
oh
i
think
it
more
than
that
what
do
you
say
jon
i
do
know
at
all
stammered
jon
his
father
face
had
a
sudden
grimness
the
young
are
tired
of
us
our
gods
and
our
ideals
off
with
their
heads
they
their
idols
and
let
get
back
and
by
jove
they
done
it
jon
a
poet
he
be
going
in
too
and
stamping
on
what
left
of
us
property
beauty
smoke
we
must
own
anything
nowadays
not
even
our
feelings
they
stand
in
the
way
jon
listened
bewildered
almost
outraged
by
his
father
words
behind
which
he
felt
a
meaning
that
he
could
not
reach
he
did
want
to
stamp
on
anything
nothing
the
god
of
continued
jolyon
we
back
where
the
russians
were
sixty
years
ago
when
they
started
no
dad
cried
jon
suddenly
we
only
want
to
live
and
we
do
know
how
because
of
the
all
by
george
said
jolyon
that
profound
jon
is
it
your
own
the
past
old
ownerships
old
passions
and
their
aftermath
let
have
conscious
that
his
mother
had
lifted
her
hand
to
her
lips
quickly
as
if
to
hush
something
jon
handed
the
cigarettes
he
lighted
his
and
fleur
then
one
for
himself
had
he
taken
the
knock
that
val
had
spoken
of
the
smoke
was
blue
when
he
had
not
puffed
grey
when
he
had
he
liked
the
sensation
in
his
nose
and
the
sense
of
equality
it
gave
him
he
was
glad
no
one
said
so
you
begun
he
felt
less
young
fleur
looked
at
her
watch
and
rose
his
mother
went
with
her
into
the
house
jon
stayed
with
his
father
puffing
at
the
cigarette
see
her
into
the
car
old
man
said
jolyon
and
when
she
gone
ask
your
mother
to
come
back
to
jon
went
he
waited
in
the
hall
he
saw
her
into
the
car
there
was
no
chance
for
any
word
hardly
for
a
pressure
of
the
hand
he
waited
all
that
evening
for
something
to
be
said
to
him
nothing
was
said
nothing
might
have
happened
he
went
up
to
bed
and
in
the
mirror
on
his
met
himself
he
did
not
speak
nor
did
the
image
but
both
looked
as
if
they
thought
the
more
green
street
uncertain
whether
the
impression
that
prosper
profond
was
dangerous
should
be
traced
to
his
attempt
to
give
val
the
mayfly
filly
to
a
remark
of
fleur
he
like
the
hosts
of
prowls
and
prowls
around
to
his
preposterous
inquiry
of
jack
cardigan
what
the
use
of
keepin
fit
or
more
simply
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
foreigner
or
alien
as
it
was
now
called
certain
that
annette
was
looking
particularly
handsome
and
that
sold
him
a
gauguin
and
then
torn
up
the
cheque
so
that
monsieur
profond
himself
had
said
i
get
that
small
picture
i
bought
from
however
suspiciously
regarded
he
still
frequented
winifred
evergreen
little
house
in
green
street
with
a
obtuseness
which
no
one
mistook
for
naivete
a
word
hardly
applicable
to
monsieur
prosper
profond
winifred
still
found
him
amusing
and
would
write
him
little
notes
saying
come
and
have
a
with
us
was
breath
of
life
to
her
to
keep
up
with
the
phrases
of
the
day
the
mystery
with
which
all
felt
him
to
be
surrounded
was
due
to
his
having
done
seen
heard
and
known
everything
and
found
nothing
in
was
unnatural
the
english
type
of
disillusionment
was
familiar
enough
to
winifred
who
had
always
moved
in
fashionable
circles
it
gave
a
certain
cachet
or
distinction
so
that
one
got
something
out
of
it
but
to
see
nothing
in
anything
not
as
a
pose
but
because
there
was
nothing
in
anything
was
not
english
and
that
which
was
not
english
one
could
not
help
secretly
feeling
dangerous
if
not
precisely
bad
form
it
was
like
having
the
mood
which
the
war
had
left
heavy
smiling
your
empire
chair
it
was
like
listening
to
that
mood
talking
through
thick
pink
lips
above
a
little
diabolic
beard
it
was
as
jack
cardigan
expressed
the
english
character
at
a
bit
too
thick
if
nothing
was
really
worth
getting
excited
about
there
were
always
games
and
one
could
make
it
so
even
winifred
ever
a
forsyte
at
heart
felt
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
out
of
such
a
mood
of
disillusionment
so
that
it
really
ought
not
to
be
there
monsieur
profond
in
fact
made
the
mood
too
plain
in
a
country
which
decently
veiled
such
realities
when
fleur
after
her
hurried
return
from
robin
hill
came
down
to
dinner
that
evening
the
mood
was
standing
at
the
window
of
little
looking
out
into
green
street
with
an
air
of
seeing
nothing
in
it
and
fleur
gazed
promptly
into
the
fireplace
with
an
air
of
seeing
a
fire
which
was
not
there
monsieur
profond
came
from
the
window
he
was
in
full
fig
with
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
white
flower
in
his
buttonhole
well
miss
forsyde
he
said
i
awful
pleased
to
see
you
forsyde
well
i
was
sayin
i
want
to
see
him
have
some
pleasure
he
you
think
so
said
fleur
shortly
worries
repeated
monsieur
profond
burring
the
r
fleur
spun
round
shall
i
tell
you
she
said
what
would
give
him
pleasure
but
the
words
to
hear
that
you
had
cleared
out
died
at
the
expression
on
his
face
all
his
fine
white
teeth
were
showing
i
was
hearin
at
the
club
about
his
old
fleur
opened
her
eyes
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
profond
moved
his
sleek
head
as
if
to
minimize
his
statement
before
you
were
born
he
said
that
small
though
conscious
that
he
had
cleverly
diverted
her
from
his
own
share
in
her
father
worry
fleur
was
unable
to
withstand
a
rush
of
nervous
curiosity
tell
me
what
you
why
murmured
monsieur
profond
you
know
all
i
expect
i
do
but
i
should
like
to
know
that
you
have
heard
it
all
his
first
wife
murmured
monsieur
profond
choking
back
the
words
he
was
never
married
before
she
said
well
what
about
her
mr
george
forsyde
was
tellin
me
about
your
father
first
wife
marryin
his
cousin
jolyon
afterward
it
was
a
small
bit
unpleasant
i
should
think
i
saw
their
boy
fleur
looked
up
monsieur
profond
was
swimming
heavily
diabolical
before
her
reason
with
the
most
heroic
effort
of
her
life
so
far
she
managed
to
arrest
that
swimming
figure
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
had
noticed
and
just
then
winifred
came
in
oh
here
you
both
are
already
imogen
and
i
have
had
the
most
amusing
afternoon
at
the
babies
what
babies
said
fleur
mechanically
the
the
babies
i
got
such
a
bargain
my
dear
a
piece
of
old
armenian
before
the
flood
i
want
your
opinion
on
it
auntie
whispered
fleur
suddenly
at
the
tone
in
the
girl
voice
winifred
closed
in
on
her
what
the
matter
are
you
well
monsieur
profond
had
withdrawn
into
the
window
where
he
was
practically
out
of
hearing
auntie
told
me
that
father
has
been
married
before
is
it
true
that
he
divorced
her
and
she
married
jon
forsyte
father
never
in
all
the
life
of
the
mother
of
four
little
darties
had
winifred
felt
more
seriously
embarrassed
her
niece
face
was
so
pale
her
eyes
so
dark
her
voice
so
whispery
and
strained
your
father
did
wish
you
to
hear
she
said
with
all
the
aplomb
she
could
muster
these
things
will
happen
i
often
told
him
he
ought
to
let
you
oh
said
fleur
and
that
was
all
but
it
made
winifred
pat
her
firm
little
shoulder
nice
and
white
she
never
could
help
an
appraising
eye
and
touch
in
the
matter
of
her
niece
who
would
have
to
be
married
of
not
to
that
boy
jon
we
forgotten
all
about
it
years
and
years
ago
she
said
comfortably
come
and
have
dinner
no
auntie
i
do
feel
very
well
may
i
go
upstairs
my
dear
murmured
winifred
concerned
you
not
taking
this
to
heart
why
you
have
properly
come
out
yet
that
boy
a
child
what
boy
i
only
got
a
headache
but
i
ca
stand
that
man
well
well
said
winifred
go
and
lie
down
i
send
you
some
bromide
and
i
shall
talk
to
prosper
profond
what
business
had
he
to
gossip
though
i
must
say
i
think
it
much
better
you
should
fleur
smiled
yes
she
said
and
slipped
from
the
room
she
went
up
with
her
head
whirling
a
dry
sensation
in
her
throat
a
guttered
frightened
feeling
in
her
breast
never
in
her
life
as
yet
had
she
suffered
from
even
momentary
fear
that
she
would
not
get
what
she
had
set
her
heart
on
the
sensations
of
the
afternoon
had
been
full
and
poignant
and
this
gruesome
discovery
coming
on
the
top
of
them
had
really
made
her
head
ache
no
wonder
her
father
had
hidden
that
photograph
so
secretly
behind
her
of
having
kept
it
but
could
he
hate
jon
mother
and
yet
keep
her
photograph
she
pressed
her
hands
over
her
forehead
trying
to
see
things
clearly
had
they
told
her
visit
to
robin
hill
forced
them
to
tell
him
everything
now
turned
on
that
she
knew
they
all
knew
she
walked
up
and
down
biting
her
lip
and
thinking
desperately
hard
jon
loved
his
mother
if
they
had
told
him
what
would
he
do
she
could
not
tell
but
if
they
had
not
told
him
should
she
she
not
get
him
for
married
to
him
before
he
knew
she
searched
her
memories
of
robin
hill
his
mother
face
so
its
dark
eyes
and
as
if
powdered
hair
its
reserve
its
her
and
his
sunken
ironic
instinctively
she
felt
they
would
shrink
from
telling
jon
even
now
shrink
from
hurting
of
course
it
would
hurt
him
awfully
to
know
her
aunt
must
be
made
not
to
tell
her
father
that
she
knew
so
long
as
neither
she
herself
nor
jon
were
supposed
to
know
there
was
still
a
to
cover
one
tracks
and
get
what
her
heart
was
set
on
but
she
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
her
isolation
every
one
hand
was
against
one
it
was
as
jon
had
and
she
just
wanted
to
live
and
the
past
was
in
their
way
a
past
they
had
shared
in
and
did
understand
oh
what
a
shame
and
suddenly
she
thought
of
june
would
she
help
them
for
somehow
june
had
left
on
her
the
impression
that
she
would
be
sympathetic
with
their
love
impatient
of
obstacle
then
instinctively
she
thought
wo
give
anything
away
though
even
to
her
i
dare
i
mean
to
have
jon
against
them
all
soup
was
brought
up
to
her
and
one
of
winifred
pet
headache
cachets
she
swallowed
both
then
winifred
herself
appeared
fleur
opened
her
campaign
with
the
words
you
know
auntie
i
do
wish
people
would
think
i
in
love
with
that
boy
why
i
hardly
seen
him
winifred
though
experienced
was
not
she
accepted
the
remark
with
considerable
relief
of
course
it
was
not
pleasant
for
the
girl
to
hear
of
the
family
scandal
and
she
set
herself
to
minimise
the
matter
a
task
for
which
she
was
eminently
qualified
raised
fashionably
under
a
comfortable
mother
and
a
father
whose
nerves
might
not
be
shaken
and
for
many
years
the
wife
of
montague
dartie
her
description
was
a
masterpiece
of
understatement
fleur
father
first
wife
had
been
very
foolish
there
had
been
a
young
man
who
had
got
run
over
and
she
had
left
fleur
father
then
years
after
when
it
might
all
have
again
she
had
taken
up
with
their
cousin
jolyon
and
of
course
her
father
had
been
obliged
to
have
a
divorce
nobody
remembered
anything
of
it
now
except
just
the
family
and
perhaps
it
had
all
turned
out
for
the
best
her
father
had
fleur
and
jolyon
and
irene
had
been
quite
happy
they
said
and
their
boy
was
a
nice
boy
val
having
holly
too
is
a
sort
of
plaster
do
you
know
with
these
soothing
words
winifred
patted
her
niece
shoulder
thought
a
nice
plump
little
thing
and
went
back
to
prosper
profond
who
in
spite
of
his
indiscretion
was
very
amusing
this
evening
for
some
minutes
after
her
aunt
had
gone
fleur
remained
under
influence
of
bromide
material
and
spiritual
but
then
reality
came
back
her
aunt
had
left
out
all
that
the
feeling
the
hate
the
love
the
unforgivingness
of
passionate
hearts
she
who
knew
so
little
of
life
and
had
touched
only
the
fringe
of
love
was
yet
aware
by
instinct
that
words
have
as
little
relation
to
fact
and
feeling
as
coin
to
the
bread
it
buys
father
she
thought
me
poor
jon
but
i
care
i
mean
to
have
him
from
the
window
of
her
darkened
room
she
saw
that
man
issue
from
the
door
below
and
prowl
away
if
he
and
her
would
that
affect
her
chance
surely
it
must
make
her
father
cling
to
her
more
closely
so
that
he
would
consent
in
the
end
to
anything
she
wanted
or
become
reconciled
the
sooner
to
what
she
did
without
his
knowledge
she
took
some
earth
from
the
in
the
window
and
with
all
her
might
flung
it
after
that
disappearing
figure
it
fell
short
but
the
action
did
her
good
and
a
little
puff
of
air
came
up
from
green
street
smelling
of
petrol
not
sweet
forsyte
affairs
soames
coming
up
to
the
city
with
the
intention
of
calling
in
at
green
street
at
the
end
of
his
day
and
taking
fleur
back
home
with
him
suffered
from
rumination
sleeping
partner
that
he
was
he
seldom
visited
the
city
now
but
he
still
had
a
room
of
his
own
at
cuthcott
kingson
and
forsyte
and
one
special
clerk
and
a
half
assigned
to
the
management
of
purely
forsyte
affairs
they
were
somewhat
in
flux
just
auspicious
moment
for
the
disposal
of
house
property
and
soames
was
unloading
the
estates
of
his
father
and
uncle
roger
and
to
some
extent
of
his
uncle
nicholas
his
shrewd
and
probity
in
all
money
concerns
had
made
him
something
of
an
autocrat
in
connection
with
these
trusts
if
soames
thought
this
or
thought
that
one
had
better
save
oneself
the
bother
of
thinking
too
he
guaranteed
as
it
were
irresponsibility
to
numerous
forsytes
of
the
third
and
fourth
generations
his
fellow
trustees
such
as
his
cousins
roger
or
nicholas
his
tweetyman
and
spender
or
his
sister
husband
all
trusted
him
he
signed
first
and
where
he
signed
first
they
signed
after
and
nobody
was
a
penny
the
worse
just
now
they
were
all
a
good
many
pennies
the
better
and
soames
was
beginning
to
see
the
close
of
certain
trusts
except
for
distribution
of
the
income
from
securities
as
as
was
compatible
with
the
period
passing
the
more
feverish
parts
of
the
city
toward
the
most
perfect
backwater
in
london
he
ruminated
money
was
extraordinarily
tight
and
morality
extraordinarily
loose
the
war
had
done
it
banks
were
not
lending
people
breaking
contracts
all
over
the
place
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
air
and
a
look
on
faces
that
he
did
not
like
the
country
seemed
in
for
a
spell
of
gambling
and
bankruptcies
there
was
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
neither
he
nor
his
trusts
had
an
investment
which
could
be
affected
by
anything
less
maniacal
than
national
repudiation
or
a
levy
on
capital
if
soames
had
faith
it
was
in
what
he
called
english
common
sense
the
power
to
have
things
if
not
one
way
then
another
he
his
father
james
before
he
did
know
what
things
were
coming
to
but
he
never
in
his
heart
believed
they
were
if
it
rested
with
him
they
after
all
he
was
only
an
englishman
like
any
other
so
quietly
tenacious
of
what
he
had
that
he
knew
he
would
never
really
part
with
it
without
something
more
or
less
equivalent
in
exchange
his
mind
was
essentially
equilibristic
in
material
matters
and
his
way
of
putting
the
national
situation
difficult
to
refute
in
a
world
composed
of
human
beings
take
his
own
case
for
example
he
was
well
off
did
that
do
anybody
harm
he
did
not
eat
ten
meals
a
day
he
ate
no
more
than
perhaps
not
so
much
as
a
poor
man
he
spent
no
money
on
vice
breathed
no
more
air
used
no
more
water
to
speak
of
than
the
mechanic
or
the
porter
he
certainly
had
pretty
things
about
him
but
they
had
given
employment
in
the
making
and
somebody
must
use
them
he
bought
pictures
but
art
must
be
encouraged
he
was
in
fact
an
accidental
channel
through
which
money
flowed
employing
labour
what
was
there
objectionable
in
that
in
his
charge
money
was
in
quicker
and
more
useful
flux
than
it
would
be
in
charge
of
the
state
and
a
lot
of
officials
and
as
to
what
he
saved
each
was
just
as
much
in
flux
as
what
he
did
save
going
into
water
board
or
council
stocks
or
something
sound
and
useful
the
state
paid
him
no
salary
for
being
trustee
of
his
own
or
other
people
money
he
did
all
that
for
nothing
therein
lay
the
whole
case
against
of
private
property
were
unpaid
and
yet
had
every
incentive
to
quicken
up
the
flux
under
the
opposite
in
a
country
smarting
from
officialism
he
felt
that
he
had
a
strong
case
it
particularly
annoyed
him
entering
that
backwater
of
perfect
peace
to
think
that
a
lot
of
unscrupulous
trusts
and
combinations
had
been
cornering
the
market
in
goods
of
all
kinds
and
keeping
prices
at
an
artificial
height
such
abusers
of
the
individualistic
system
were
the
ruffians
who
caused
all
the
trouble
and
it
was
some
satisfaction
to
see
them
getting
into
a
stew
at
last
lest
the
whole
thing
might
come
down
with
a
land
them
in
the
soup
the
offices
of
cuthcott
kingson
and
forsyte
occupied
the
ground
and
first
floors
of
a
house
on
the
side
and
ascending
to
his
room
soames
thought
we
had
a
coat
of
paint
his
old
clerk
gradman
was
seated
where
he
always
was
at
a
huge
bureau
with
countless
pigeonholes
stood
beside
him
with
a
broker
note
recording
investment
of
the
proceeds
from
sale
of
the
bryanston
square
house
in
roger
forsyte
estate
soames
took
it
and
said
vancouver
city
stock
h
it
down
today
with
a
sort
of
grating
ingratiation
old
gradman
answered
him
but
everything
down
and
withdrew
soames
skewered
the
document
on
to
a
number
of
other
papers
and
hung
up
his
hat
i
want
to
look
at
my
will
and
marriage
settlement
old
gradman
moving
to
the
limit
of
his
swivel
chair
drew
out
two
drafts
from
the
bottom
lefthand
drawer
recovering
his
body
he
raised
his
face
very
red
from
stooping
copies
soames
took
them
it
struck
him
suddenly
how
like
gradman
was
to
the
stout
brindled
yard
dog
they
had
been
wont
to
keep
on
his
chain
at
the
shelter
till
one
day
fleur
had
come
and
insisted
it
should
be
let
loose
so
that
it
had
at
once
bitten
the
cook
and
been
destroyed
if
you
let
gradman
off
his
chain
would
he
bite
the
cook
checking
this
frivolous
fancy
soames
unfolded
his
marriage
settlement
he
had
not
looked
at
it
for
over
eighteen
years
not
since
he
remade
his
will
when
his
father
died
and
fleur
was
born
he
wanted
to
see
whether
the
words
during
coverture
were
in
yes
they
expression
when
you
thought
of
it
and
derived
perhaps
from
interest
on
fifteen
thousand
pounds
which
he
paid
her
without
deducting
income
tax
so
long
as
she
remained
his
wife
and
afterward
during
widowhood
dum
casta
and
rather
pointed
words
put
in
to
insure
the
conduct
of
fleur
mother
his
will
made
it
up
to
an
annuity
of
a
thousand
under
the
same
conditions
all
right
he
returned
the
copies
to
gradman
who
took
them
without
looking
up
swung
the
chair
restored
the
papers
to
their
drawer
and
went
on
casting
up
gradman
i
do
like
the
condition
of
the
country
there
are
a
lot
of
people
about
without
any
common
sense
i
want
to
find
a
way
by
which
i
can
safeguard
miss
fleur
against
anything
which
might
gradman
wrote
the
figure
on
his
he
said
there
a
nahsty
the
ordinary
restraint
against
anticipation
does
meet
the
nao
said
gradman
suppose
those
labour
fellows
come
in
or
worse
it
these
people
with
fixed
ideas
who
are
the
danger
look
at
ireland
ah
said
gradman
suppose
i
were
to
make
a
settlement
on
her
at
once
with
myself
as
beneficiary
for
life
they
could
take
anything
but
the
interest
from
me
unless
of
course
they
alter
the
gradman
moved
his
head
and
smiled
ah
he
said
they
would
do
i
do
know
muttered
soames
i
do
trust
it
take
two
years
sir
to
be
valid
against
death
soames
sniffed
two
years
he
was
only
that
not
the
point
draw
a
form
of
settlement
that
passes
all
my
property
to
miss
fleur
children
in
equal
shares
with
antecedent
first
to
myself
and
then
to
her
without
power
of
anticipation
and
add
a
clause
that
in
the
event
of
anything
happening
to
divert
her
that
interest
passes
to
the
trustees
to
apply
for
her
benefit
in
their
absolute
gradman
grated
rather
extreme
at
your
age
sir
you
lose
that
my
business
said
soames
sharply
gradman
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
discretion
and
said
what
trustees
there
young
kingson
he
a
nice
steady
young
yes
he
might
do
for
one
i
must
have
three
there
is
a
forsyte
now
who
appeals
to
not
young
nicholas
he
at
the
bar
we
given
he
never
set
the
thames
on
fire
said
soames
a
smile
oozed
out
on
gradman
face
greasy
from
countless
the
smile
of
a
man
who
sits
all
day
you
ca
expect
it
at
his
age
why
what
is
he
forty
quite
a
young
well
put
him
in
but
i
want
somebody
who
take
a
personal
interest
there
no
one
that
i
can
what
about
valerius
now
he
come
home
val
dartie
with
that
father
murmured
gradman
he
been
dead
seven
statute
runs
against
no
said
soames
i
do
like
the
he
rose
gradman
said
suddenly
if
they
were
makin
a
levy
on
capital
they
could
come
on
the
trustees
sir
so
there
you
be
just
the
same
i
think
it
over
if
i
were
that
true
said
soames
i
will
what
have
you
done
about
that
dilapidation
notice
in
vere
street
i
served
it
yet
the
party
very
old
she
wo
want
to
go
out
at
her
i
do
know
this
spirit
of
unrest
touches
every
still
i
lookin
at
things
broadly
sir
she
better
serve
it
said
soames
and
see
what
she
says
oh
and
timothy
is
everything
in
order
in
case
i
got
the
inventory
of
his
estate
all
ready
had
the
furniture
and
pictures
valued
so
that
we
know
what
reserves
to
put
on
i
shall
be
sorry
when
he
goes
though
dear
me
it
is
a
time
since
i
first
saw
timothy
we
ca
live
for
ever
said
soames
taking
down
his
hat
nao
said
gradman
but
it
be
a
last
of
the
old
family
shall
i
take
up
the
matter
of
that
nuisance
in
old
compton
street
those
nahsty
do
i
must
call
for
miss
fleur
and
catch
the
four
soames
i
hope
miss
well
enough
but
gads
about
too
grated
gradman
she
soames
went
out
musing
old
gradman
if
he
were
younger
i
put
him
in
the
trust
there
nobody
i
can
depend
on
to
take
a
real
leaving
the
bilious
and
mathematical
exactitude
the
preposterous
peace
of
that
backwater
he
thought
suddenly
coverture
why
they
exclude
fellows
like
profond
instead
of
a
lot
of
germans
and
was
surprised
at
the
depth
of
uneasiness
which
could
provoke
so
unpatriotic
a
thought
but
there
it
was
one
never
got
a
moment
of
real
peace
there
was
always
something
at
the
back
of
everything
and
he
made
his
way
toward
green
street
two
hours
later
by
his
watch
thomas
gradman
stirring
in
his
swivel
chair
closed
the
last
drawer
of
his
bureau
and
putting
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
bunch
of
keys
so
fat
that
they
gave
him
a
protuberance
on
the
liver
side
brushed
his
old
top
hat
round
with
his
sleeve
took
his
umbrella
and
descended
thick
short
and
buttoned
closely
into
his
old
frock
coat
he
walked
toward
covent
garden
market
he
never
missed
that
daily
promenade
to
the
tube
for
highgate
and
seldom
some
critical
transaction
on
the
way
in
connection
with
vegetables
and
fruit
generations
might
be
born
and
hats
might
change
wars
be
fought
and
forsytes
fade
away
but
thomas
gradman
faithful
and
grey
would
take
his
daily
walk
and
buy
his
daily
vegetable
times
were
not
what
they
were
and
his
son
had
lost
a
leg
and
they
never
gave
him
those
nice
little
plaited
baskets
to
carry
the
stuff
in
now
and
these
tubes
were
convenient
he
must
complain
his
health
was
good
considering
his
time
of
life
and
after
years
in
the
law
he
was
getting
a
round
eight
hundred
a
year
and
a
little
worried
of
late
because
it
was
mostly
collector
commission
on
the
rents
and
with
all
this
conversion
of
forsyte
property
going
on
it
looked
like
drying
up
and
the
price
of
living
still
so
high
but
it
was
no
good
the
good
god
made
us
all
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
still
house
property
in
did
know
what
roger
or
james
would
say
if
they
could
see
it
being
sold
like
to
show
a
lack
of
faith
but
worried
life
and
lives
in
being
and
years
that
you
could
go
still
he
kept
his
health
miss
fleur
was
a
pretty
little
was
she
marry
but
lots
of
people
had
no
children
had
had
his
first
child
at
and
jolyon
married
while
he
was
at
cambridge
had
his
child
the
same
peter
that
was
back
in
a
long
time
before
old
judge
of
taken
his
will
away
from
yes
those
were
the
days
when
they
were
buyin
property
right
and
left
and
none
of
this
khaki
and
over
one
another
to
get
out
of
things
and
cucumbers
at
twopence
and
a
old
melons
that
made
your
mouth
water
fifty
years
since
he
went
into
james
office
and
james
had
said
to
him
now
gradman
you
only
a
pay
attention
and
you
make
your
five
hundred
a
year
before
you
and
he
had
and
feared
god
and
served
the
forsytes
and
kept
a
vegetable
diet
at
night
and
buying
a
copy
of
john
that
he
approved
of
it
an
extravagant
entered
the
tube
elevator
with
his
mere
parcel
and
was
borne
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
private
life
on
his
way
to
green
street
it
occurred
to
soames
that
he
ought
to
go
into
dumetrius
in
suffolk
street
about
the
possibility
of
the
bolderby
old
crome
almost
worth
while
to
have
fought
the
war
to
have
the
bolderby
old
crome
as
it
were
in
flux
old
bolderby
had
died
his
son
and
grandson
had
been

was
coming
into
the
estate
who
meant
to
sell
it
some
said
because
of
the
condition
of
england
others
said
because
he
had
asthma
if
dumetrius
once
got
hold
of
it
the
price
would
become
prohibitive
it
was
necessary
for
soames
to
find
out
whether
dumetrius
had
got
it
before
he
tried
to
get
it
himself
he
therefore
confined
himself
to
discussing
with
dumetrius
whether
monticellis
would
come
again
now
that
it
was
the
fashion
for
a
picture
to
be
anything
except
a
picture
and
the
future
of
johns
with
a
into
buxton
knights
it
was
only
when
leaving
that
he
added
so
they
not
selling
the
bolderby
old
crome
after
all
in
sheer
pride
of
racial
superiority
as
he
had
calculated
would
be
the
case
dumetrius
replied
oh
i
shall
get
it
forsyte
sir
the
flutter
of
his
eyelid
fortified
soames
in
a
resolution
to
write
direct
to
the
new
bolderby
suggesting
that
the
only
dignified
way
of
dealing
with
an
old
crome
was
to
avoid
dealers
he
therefore
said
well
and
went
leaving
dumetrius
the
wiser
at
green
street
he
found
that
fleur
was
out
and
would
be
all
the
evening
she
was
staying
one
more
night
in
london
he
cabbed
on
dejectedly
and
caught
his
train
he
reached
his
house
about
six
the
air
was
heavy
midges
biting
thunder
about
taking
his
letters
he
went
up
to
his
to
cleanse
himself
of
london
an
uninteresting
post
a
receipt
a
bill
for
purchases
on
behalf
of
fleur
a
circular
about
an
exhibition
of
etchings
a
letter
beginning
sir
i
feel
it
my
duty
that
would
be
an
appeal
or
something
unpleasant
he
looked
at
once
for
the
signature
there
was
none
incredulously
he
turned
the
page
over
and
examined
each
corner
not
being
a
public
man
soames
had
never
yet
had
an
anonymous
letter
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
tear
it
up
as
a
dangerous
thing
his
second
to
read
it
as
a
thing
still
more
dangerous
sir
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
having
no
interest
in
the
matter
your
lady
is
carrying
on
with
a
reaching
that
word
soames
stopped
mechanically
and
examined
the
postmark
so
far
as
he
could
pierce
the
impenetrable
disguise
in
which
the
post
office
had
wrapped
it
there
was
something
with
a
sea
at
the
end
and
a
t
in
it
chelsea
no
battersea
perhaps
he
read
on
these
foreigners
are
all
the
same
sack
the
lot
this
one
meets
your
lady
twice
a
week
i
know
it
of
my
own
to
see
an
englishman
put
on
goes
against
the
grain
you
watch
it
and
see
if
what
i
say
is
true
i
should
meddle
if
it
was
a
dirty
foreigner
in
it
yours
the
sensation
with
which
soames
dropped
the
letter
was
similar
to
that
he
would
have
had
entering
his
bedroom
and
finding
it
full
of
the
meanness
of
anonymity
gave
a
shuddering
obscenity
to
the
moment
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
this
shadow
had
been
at
the
back
of
his
mind
ever
since
the
sunday
evening
when
fleur
had
pointed
down
at
prosper
profond
strolling
on
the
lawn
and
said
prowling
cat
had
he
not
in
connection
therewith
this
very
day
perused
his
will
and
marriage
settlement
and
now
this
anonymous
ruffian
with
nothing
to
gain
apparently
save
the
venting
of
his
spite
against
foreigners
had
wrenched
it
out
of
the
obscurity
in
which
he
had
hoped
and
wished
it
would
remain
to
have
such
knowledge
forced
on
him
at
his
time
of
life
about
fleur
mother
he
picked
the
letter
up
from
the
carpet
tore
it
across
and
then
when
it
hung
together
by
just
the
fold
at
the
back
stopped
tearing
and
reread
it
he
was
taking
at
that
moment
one
of
the
decisive
resolutions
of
his
life
he
would
not
be
forced
into
another
scandal
no
however
he
decided
to
deal
with
this
it
required
the
most
and
careful
consideration
he
would
do
nothing
that
might
injure
fleur
that
resolution
taken
his
mind
answered
the
helm
again
and
he
made
his
ablutions
his
hands
trembled
as
he
dried
them
scandal
he
would
not
have
but
something
must
be
done
to
stop
this
sort
of
thing
he
went
into
his
wife
room
and
stood
looking
around
him
the
idea
of
searching
for
anything
which
would
incriminate
and
entitle
him
to
hold
a
menace
over
her
did
not
even
come
to
him
there
would
be
was
much
too
practical
the
idea
of
having
her
watched
had
been
dismissed
before
it
well
he
remembered
his
previous
experience
of
that
no
he
had
nothing
but
this
letter
from
some
anonymous
ruffian
whose
impudent
intrusion
into
his
private
life
he
so
violently
resented
it
was
repugnant
to
him
to
make
use
of
it
but
he
might
have
to
what
a
mercy
fleur
was
not
at
home
a
tap
on
the
door
broke
up
his
painful
cogitations
mr
michael
mont
sir
is
in
the
will
you
see
him
no
said
soames
yes
i
come
anything
that
would
take
his
mind
off
for
a
few
minutes
michael
mont
in
flannels
stood
on
the
verandah
smoking
a
cigarette
he
threw
it
away
as
soames
came
up
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
soames
feeling
toward
this
young
man
was
singular
he
was
no
doubt
a
rackety
irresponsible
young
fellow
according
to
old
standards
yet
somehow
likeable
with
his
extraordinarily
cheerful
way
of
blurting
out
his
opinions
come
in
he
said
have
you
had
tea
mont
came
in
i
thought
fleur
would
have
been
back
sir
but
i
glad
she
is
the
fact
is
fearfully
gone
on
her
so
fearfully
gone
that
i
thought
you
better
know
it
of
course
coming
to
fathers
first
but
i
thought
you
forgive
that
i
went
to
my
own
dad
and
he
says
if
i
settle
down
he
see
me
through
he
rather
cottons
to
the
idea
in
fact
i
told
him
about
your
oh
said
soames
inexpressibly
dry
he
rather
cottons
yes
sir
do
you
soames
smiled
faintly
you
see
resumed
mont
twiddling
his
straw
hat
while
his
hair
ears
eyebrows
all
seemed
to
stand
up
from
excitement
when
you
been
through
the
war
you
ca
help
being
in
a
to
get
married
and
unmarried
afterward
said
soames
slowly
not
from
fleur
sir
imagine
if
you
were
me
soames
cleared
his
throat
that
way
of
putting
it
was
forcible
enough
fleur
too
young
he
said
oh
no
sir
we
awfully
old
nowadays
my
dad
seems
to
me
a
perfect
babe
his
thinking
apparatus
has
turned
a
hair
but
he
a
baronight
of
course
that
keeps
him
baronight
repeated
soames
what
may
that
be
bart
sir
i
shall
be
a
bart
some
day
but
i
shall
live
it
down
you
go
away
and
live
this
down
said
soames
young
mont
said
imploringly
oh
no
sir
i
simply
must
hang
around
or
i
should
have
a
dog
chance
you
let
fleur
do
what
she
likes
i
suppose
anyway
madame
passes
indeed
said
soames
frigidly
you
do
really
bar
me
do
you
and
the
young
man
looked
so
doleful
that
soames
smiled
you
may
think
you
very
old
he
said
but
you
strike
me
as
extremely
young
to
rattle
ahead
of
everything
is
not
a
proof
of
all
right
sir
i
give
you
our
age
but
to
show
you
i
mean
got
a
glad
to
hear
joined
a
publisher
my
governor
is
putting
up
the
soames
put
his
hand
over
his
had
so
very
nearly
said
god
help
the
publisher
his
grey
eyes
scrutinised
the
agitated
young
man
i
do
dislike
you
mont
but
fleur
is
everything
to
me
you
understand
yes
sir
i
know
but
so
she
is
to
that
as
may
be
i
glad
you
told
me
however
and
now
i
think
there
nothing
more
to
be
i
know
it
rests
with
her
it
will
rest
with
her
a
long
time
i
you
are
cheering
said
mont
suddenly
no
said
soames
my
experience
of
life
has
not
made
me
anxious
to
couple
people
in
a
hurry
mont
i
sha
tell
fleur
what
you
oh
murmured
mont
blankly
i
really
could
knock
my
brains
out
for
want
of
her
she
knows
that
perfectly
i
dare
and
soames
held
out
his
hand
a
distracted
squeeze
a
heavy
sigh
and
soon
after
sounds
from
the
young
man
called
up
visions
of
flying
dust
and
broken
bones
younger
generation
he
thought
heavily
and
went
out
on
to
the
lawn
the
gardeners
had
been
mowing
and
there
was
still
the
smell
of
thundery
air
kept
all
scents
close
to
earth
the
sky
was
of
a
purplish
poplars
black
two
or
three
boats
passed
on
the
river
scuttling
as
it
were
for
shelter
before
the
storm
days
fine
weather
thought
soames
then
a
storm
where
was
annette
with
that
chap
for
all
he
was
a
young
woman
impressed
with
the
queer
charity
of
that
thought
he
entered
the
summerhouse
and
sat
down
the
fact
he
admitted
was
so
much
to
him
that
his
wife
was
very
little
never
been
much
more
than
a
mistress
and
he
was
getting
indifferent
to
that
side
of
things
it
was
odd
how
with
all
this
ingrained
care
for
moderation
and
secure
investment
soames
ever
put
his
emotional
eggs
into
one
basket
first
fleur
he
was
dimly
conscious
of
it
sitting
there
conscious
of
its
odd
dangerousness
it
had
brought
him
to
wreck
and
scandal
once
but
it
should
save
him
he
cared
so
much
for
fleur
that
he
would
have
no
further
scandal
if
only
he
could
get
at
that
anonymous
he
would
teach
him
not
to
meddle
and
stir
up
mud
at
the
bottom
of
water
which
he
wished
should
remain
stagnant
a
distant
flash
a
low
rumble
and
large
drops
of
rain
spattered
on
the
thatch
above
him
he
remained
indifferent
tracing
a
pattern
with
his
finger
on
the
dusty
surface
of
a
little
rustic
table
fleur
future
want
fair
sailing
for
her
he
thought
else
matters
at
my
time
of
life
a
lonely
what
you
had
you
never
could
keep
to
yourself
as
you
warned
one
off
you
let
another
in
one
could
make
sure
of
nothing
he
reached
up
and
pulled
a
red
rambler
rose
from
a
cluster
which
blocked
the
window
flowers
grew
and
was
a
queer
thing
the
thunder
rumbled
and
crashed
travelling
east
along
a
river
the
paling
flashes
flicked
his
eyes
the
poplar
tops
showed
sharp
and
dense
against
the
sky
a
heavy
shower
rustled
and
rattled
and
veiled
in
the
little
house
wherein
he
sat
indifferent
thinking
when
the
storm
was
over
he
left
his
retreat
and
went
down
the
wet
path
to
the
river
bank
two
swans
had
come
sheltering
in
among
the
reeds
he
knew
the
birds
well
and
stood
watching
the
dignity
in
the
curve
of
those
white
necks
and
formidable
heads
i
have
to
do
he
thought
and
yet
it
must
be
tackled
lest
worse
befell
annette
must
be
back
by
now
from
wherever
she
had
gone
for
it
was
nearly
and
as
the
moment
for
seeing
her
approached
the
difficulty
of
knowing
what
to
say
and
how
to
say
it
had
increased
a
new
and
scaring
thought
occurred
to
him
suppose
she
wanted
her
liberty
to
marry
this
fellow
well
if
she
did
she
could
have
it
he
had
not
married
her
for
that
the
image
of
prosper
profond
dawdled
before
him
reassuringly
not
a
marrying
man
no
no
anger
replaced
that
momentary
scare
had
better
not
come
my
way
he
thought
the
mongrel
but
what
did
prosper
profond
represent
nothing
that
mattered
surely
and
yet
something
real
enough
in
the
let
off
its
chain
disillusionment
on
the
prowl
that
expression
annette
had
caught
from
him
je
fiche
a
fatalistic
chap
a
product
of
the
age
if
there
were
condemnation
more
complete
soames
felt
that
he
did
not
know
it
the
swans
had
turned
their
heads
and
were
looking
past
him
into
some
distance
of
their
own
one
of
them
uttered
a
little
hiss
wagged
its
tail
turned
as
if
answering
to
a
rudder
and
swam
away
the
other
followed
their
white
bodies
their
stately
necks
passed
out
of
his
sight
and
he
went
toward
the
house
annette
was
in
the
dressed
for
dinner
and
he
thought
as
he
went
is
as
handsome
does
handsome
except
for
remarks
about
the
curtains
in
the
and
the
storm
there
was
practically
no
conversation
during
a
meal
distinguished
by
exactitude
of
quantity
and
perfection
of
quality
soames
drank
nothing
he
followed
her
into
the
afterward
and
found
her
smoking
a
cigarette
on
the
sofa
between
the
two
french
windows
she
was
leaning
back
almost
upright
in
a
low
black
frock
with
her
knees
crossed
and
her
blue
eyes
smoke
issued
from
her
red
rather
full
lips
a
fillet
bound
her
chestnut
hair
she
wore
the
thinnest
silk
stockings
and
shoes
with
very
high
heels
showing
off
her
instep
a
fine
piece
in
any
room
soames
who
held
that
torn
letter
in
a
hand
thrust
deep
into
the
of
his
said
i
going
to
shut
the
window
the
damp
lifting
he
did
so
and
stood
looking
at
a
david
cox
adorning
the
wall
close
by
what
was
she
thinking
of
he
had
never
understood
a
woman
in
his
fleur
not
always
his
heart
beat
fast
but
if
he
meant
to
do
it
now
was
the
moment
turning
from
the
david
cox
he
took
out
the
torn
letter
i
had
her
eyes
widened
stared
at
him
and
hardened
soames
handed
her
the
letter
it
torn
but
you
can
read
and
he
turned
back
to
the
david
of
good
without
movement
enough
wonder
what
that
chap
doing
at
this
moment
he
thought
astonish
him
yet
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
annette
holding
the
letter
rigidly
her
eyes
moved
from
side
to
side
under
her
darkened
lashes
and
frowning
darkened
eyes
she
dropped
the
letter
gave
a
little
shiver
smiled
and
said
dirrty
i
quite
agree
said
soames
degrading
is
it
true
a
tooth
fastened
on
her
red
lower
lip
and
what
if
it
were
she
was
brazen
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
well
speak
out
what
is
the
good
of
talking
soames
said
icily
so
you
admit
it
i
admit
nothing
you
are
a
fool
to
ask
a
man
like
you
should
not
ask
it
is
soames
made
a
tour
of
the
room
to
subdue
his
rising
anger
do
you
remember
he
said
halting
in
front
of
her
what
you
were
when
i
married
you
working
at
accounts
in
a
do
you
remember
that
i
was
not
half
your
age
soames
broke
off
the
hard
encounter
of
their
eyes
and
went
back
to
the
david
cox
i
am
not
going
to
bandy
words
i
require
you
to
give
up
i
think
of
the
matter
entirely
as
it
affects
ah
yes
said
soames
stubbornly
fleur
she
is
your
child
as
well
as
it
is
kind
to
admit
that
are
you
going
to
do
what
i
say
i
refuse
to
tell
then
i
must
make
annette
smiled
no
soames
she
said
you
are
helpless
do
not
say
things
that
you
will
anger
swelled
the
veins
on
his
forehead
he
opened
his
mouth
to
vent
that
emotion
and
could
not
annette
went
on
there
shall
be
no
more
such
letters
i
promise
you
that
is
soames
writhed
he
had
a
sense
of
being
treated
like
a
child
by
this
woman
who
had
deserved
he
did
not
know
what
when
two
people
have
married
and
lived
like
us
soames
they
had
better
be
quiet
about
each
other
there
are
things
one
does
not
drag
up
into
the
light
for
people
to
laugh
at
you
will
be
quiet
then
not
for
my
sake
for
your
own
you
are
getting
old
i
am
not
yet
you
have
made
me
practical
soames
who
had
passed
through
all
the
sensations
of
being
choked
repeated
dully
i
require
you
to
give
up
this
and
if
i
do
not
i
will
cut
you
out
of
my
somehow
it
did
not
seem
to
meet
the
case
annette
laughed
you
will
live
a
long
time
are
a
bad
woman
said
soames
suddenly
annette
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
not
think
so
living
with
you
has
killed
things
in
me
it
is
true
but
i
am
not
a
bad
woman
i
am
is
all
and
so
will
you
be
when
you
have
thought
it
i
shall
see
this
man
said
soames
sullenly
and
warn
him
mon
cher
you
are
funny
you
do
not
want
me
you
have
as
much
of
me
as
you
want
and
you
wish
the
rest
of
me
to
be
dead
i
admit
nothing
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
dead
soames
at
my
age
so
you
had
better
be
quiet
i
tell
you
i
myself
will
make
no
scandal
none
now
i
am
not
saying
any
more
whatever
you
she
reached
out
took
a
french
novel
off
a
little
table
and
opened
it
soames
watched
her
silenced
by
the
tumult
of
his
feelings
the
thought
of
that
man
was
almost
making
him
want
her
and
this
was
a
revelation
of
their
relationship
startling
to
one
little
given
to
introspective
philosophy
without
saying
another
word
he
went
out
and
up
to
the
this
came
of
marrying
a
frenchwoman
and
yet
without
her
there
would
have
been
no
fleur
she
had
served
her
purpose
right
he
thought
can
do
nothing
i
do
even
know
that
there
anything
in
it
the
instinct
of
warned
him
to
batten
down
his
hatches
to
smother
the
fire
with
want
of
air
unless
one
believed
there
was
something
in
a
thing
there
was
that
night
he
went
into
her
room
she
received
him
in
the
most
way
as
if
there
had
been
no
scene
between
them
and
he
returned
to
his
own
room
with
a
curious
sense
of
peace
if
one
choose
to
see
one
need
and
he
did
not
future
he
did
not
choose
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
opening
the
drawer
he
took
from
the
sachet
a
handkerchief
and
the
framed
photograph
of
fleur
when
he
had
looked
at
it
a
little
he
slipped
it
down
and
there
was
that
other
old
one
of
irene
an
owl
hooted
while
he
stood
in
his
window
gazing
at
it
the
owl
hooted
the
red
climbing
roses
seemed
to
deepen
in
colour
there
came
a
scent
of
god
that
had
been
a
different
thing
dust
takes
a
hand
one
who
was
a
sculptor
a
slav
a
sometime
resident
in
new
york
an
egoist
and
impecunious
was
to
be
found
of
an
evening
in
june
studio
on
the
bank
of
the
thames
at
chiswick
on
the
evening
of
july
boris
of
whose
works
were
on
show
there
because
they
were
as
yet
too
advanced
to
be
on
show
anywhere
begun
well
with
that
aloof
and
rather
silence
which
admirably
suited
his
youthful
round
broad
countenance
framed
in
bright
hair
banged
like
a
girl
june
had
known
him
three
weeks
and
he
still
seemed
to
her
the
principal
embodiment
of
genius
and
hope
of
the
future
a
sort
of
star
of
the
east
which
had
strayed
into
an
unappreciative
west
until
that
evening
he
had
conversationally
confined
himself
to
recording
his
impressions
of
the
united
states
whose
dust
he
had
just
shaken
from
off
his
country
in
his
opinion
so
barbarous
in
every
way
that
he
had
sold
practically
nothing
there
and
become
an
object
of
suspicion
to
the
police
a
country
as
he
said
without
a
race
of
its
own
without
liberty
equality
or
fraternity
without
principles
traditions
taste
a
soul
he
had
left
it
for
his
own
good
and
come
to
the
only
other
country
where
he
could
live
well
june
had
dwelt
unhappily
on
him
in
her
lonely
moments
standing
before
his
but
powerful
and
symbolic
once
they
had
been
explained
that
he
haloed
by
bright
hair
like
an
early
italian
painting
and
absorbed
in
his
genius
to
the
exclusion
of
all
only
sign
of
course
by
which
real
genius
could
be
still
be
a
lame
duck
agitated
her
warm
heart
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
paul
post
and
she
had
begun
to
take
steps
to
clear
her
gallery
in
order
to
fill
it
with
strumolowski
masterpieces
she
had
at
once
encountered
trouble
paul
post
had
kicked
vospovitch
had
stung
with
all
the
emphasis
of
a
genius
which
she
did
not
as
yet
deny
them
they
had
demanded
another
six
weeks
at
least
of
her
gallery
the
american
stream
still
flowing
in
would
soon
be
flowing
out
the
american
stream
was
their
right
their
only
hope
their
nobody
in
this
beastly
country
cared
for
art
june
had
yielded
to
the
demonstration
after
all
boris
would
not
mind
their
having
the
full
benefit
of
an
american
stream
which
he
himself
so
violently
despised
this
evening
she
had
put
that
to
boris
with
nobody
else
present
except
hannah
hobdey
the
mediaeval
and
jimmy
portugal
editor
of
the
she
had
put
it
to
him
with
that
sudden
confidence
which
continual
contact
with
the
world
had
never
been
able
to
dry
up
in
her
warm
and
generous
nature
he
had
not
broken
his
silence
however
for
more
than
two
minutes
before
she
began
to
move
her
blue
eyes
from
side
to
side
as
a
cat
moves
its
tail
characteristic
of
england
the
most
selfish
country
in
the
world
the
country
which
sucked
the
blood
of
other
countries
destroyed
the
brains
and
hearts
of
irishmen
hindus
egyptians
boers
and
burmese
all
the
best
races
in
the
world
bullying
hypocritical
england
this
was
what
he
had
expected
coming
to
such
a
country
where
the
climate
was
all
fog
and
the
people
all
tradesmen
perfectly
blind
to
art
and
sunk
in
profiteering
and
the
grossest
materialism
conscious
that
hannah
hobdey
was
murmuring
hear
hear
and
jimmy
portugal
sniggering
june
grew
crimson
and
suddenly
rapped
out
then
why
did
you
ever
come
we
did
ask
the
remark
was
so
singularly
at
variance
with
all
she
had
led
him
to
expect
from
her
that
strumolowski
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
a
cigarette
england
never
wants
an
idealist
he
said
but
in
june
something
primitively
english
was
thoroughly
upset
old
jolyon
sense
of
justice
had
risen
as
it
were
from
bed
you
come
and
sponge
on
us
she
said
and
then
abuse
us
if
you
think
that
playing
the
game
i
she
now
discovered
that
which
others
had
discovered
before
thickness
of
hide
beneath
which
the
sensibility
of
genius
is
sometimes
veiled
strumolowski
young
and
ingenuous
face
became
the
incarnation
of
a
sneer
sponge
one
does
not
sponge
one
takes
what
is
tenth
part
of
what
is
owing
you
will
repent
to
say
that
miss
oh
no
said
june
i
ah
we
know
very
well
we
take
us
to
get
what
you
can
out
of
us
i
want
nothing
from
you
he
blew
out
a
cloud
of
june
smoke
decision
rose
in
an
icy
puff
from
the
turmoil
of
insulted
shame
within
her
very
well
then
you
can
take
your
things
and
almost
in
the
same
moment
she
thought
boy
he
only
got
a
garret
and
probably
not
a
taxi
fare
in
front
of
these
people
too
it
positively
disgusting
young
strumolowski
shook
his
head
violently
his
hair
thick
smooth
close
as
a
golden
plate
did
not
fall
off
i
can
live
on
nothing
he
said
shrilly
i
have
often
had
to
for
the
sake
of
my
art
it
is
you
bourgeois
who
force
us
to
spend
the
words
hit
june
like
a
pebble
in
the
ribs
after
all
she
had
done
for
art
all
her
identification
with
its
troubles
and
lame
ducks
she
was
struggling
for
adequate
words
when
the
door
was
opened
and
her
austrian
murmured
a
young
lady
gnadiges
where
in
the
little
with
a
glance
at
boris
strumolowski
at
hannah
hobdey
at
jimmy
portugal
june
said
nothing
and
went
out
devoid
of
equanimity
entering
the
little
she
perceived
the
young
lady
to
be
very
pretty
if
pale
at
this
disenchanted
moment
a
little
lame
duck
of
her
own
breed
was
welcome
to
june
so
homoeopathic
by
instinct
the
girl
must
have
come
of
course
because
of
jon
or
if
not
at
least
to
get
something
out
of
her
and
june
felt
just
then
that
to
assist
somebody
was
the
only
bearable
thing
so
you
remembered
to
come
she
said
yes
what
a
jolly
little
duck
of
a
house
but
please
do
let
me
bother
you
if
you
got
not
at
all
said
june
i
want
to
let
them
stew
in
their
own
juice
for
a
bit
have
you
come
about
jon
you
said
you
thought
we
ought
to
be
told
well
i
found
oh
said
june
blankly
not
nice
is
it
they
were
standing
one
on
each
side
of
the
little
bare
table
at
which
june
took
her
meals
a
vase
on
it
was
full
of
iceland
poppies
the
girl
raised
her
hand
and
touched
them
with
a
gloved
finger
to
her
dress
frilly
about
the
hips
and
tight
below
the
knees
june
took
a
sudden
charming
colour
makes
a
picture
thought
june
her
little
room
with
its
whitewashed
walls
its
floor
and
hearth
of
old
pink
brick
its
black
paint
and
latticed
window
athwart
which
the
last
of
the
sunlight
was
shining
had
never
looked
so
charming
set
off
by
this
young
figure
with
the
creamy
slightly
frowning
face
she
remembered
with
sudden
vividness
how
nice
she
herself
had
looked
in
those
old
days
when
her
heart
was
set
on
philip
bosinney
that
dead
lover
who
had
broken
from
her
to
destroy
for
ever
irene
allegiance
to
this
girl
father
did
fleur
know
of
that
too
well
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
it
was
some
seconds
before
fleur
answered
i
do
want
jon
to
suffer
i
must
see
him
once
more
to
put
an
end
to
you
going
to
put
an
end
to
it
what
else
is
there
to
do
the
girl
seemed
to
june
suddenly
intolerably
spiritless
i
suppose
you
right
she
muttered
i
know
my
father
thinks
so
should
never
have
done
it
myself
i
ca
take
things
lying
how
poised
and
watchful
that
girl
looked
how
unemotional
her
voice
sounded
people
will
assume
that
i
in
well
are
you
fleur
shrugged
her
shoulders
might
have
known
it
thought
june
soames
and
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
then
she
said
with
a
sort
of
disgust
could
i
see
jon
here
on
his
way
down
to
holly
he
come
if
you
sent
him
a
line
and
perhaps
afterward
you
let
them
know
quietly
at
robin
hill
that
it
all
over
and
that
they
need
tell
jon
about
his
all
right
said
june
abruptly
i
write
now
and
you
can
post
it
two
tomorrow
i
sha
be
in
she
sat
down
at
the
tiny
bureau
which
filled
one
corner
when
she
looked
round
with
the
finished
note
fleur
was
still
touching
the
poppies
with
her
gloved
finger
june
licked
a
stamp
well
here
it
is
if
you
not
in
love
of
course
there
no
more
to
be
said
jon
fleur
took
the
note
thanks
awfully
little
baggage
thought
june
jon
son
of
her
father
to
love
and
not
to
be
loved
by
the
daughter
it
was
humiliating
is
that
all
fleur
nodded
her
frills
shook
and
trembled
as
she
swayed
toward
the
door
little
piece
of
fashion
muttered
june
closing
the
door
that
family
and
she
marched
back
toward
her
studio
boris
strumolowski
had
regained
his
silence
and
jimmy
portugal
was
damning
everybody
except
the
group
in
whose
behalf
he
ran
the
among
the
condemned
were
eric
cobbley
and
several
other
genii
who
at
one
time
or
another
had
held
first
place
in
the
repertoire
of
june
aid
and
adoration
she
experienced
a
sense
of
futility
and
disgust
and
went
to
the
window
to
let
the
blow
those
squeaky
words
away
but
when
at
length
jimmy
portugal
had
finished
and
gone
with
hannah
hobdey
she
sat
down
and
mothered
young
strumolowski
for
half
an
hour
promising
him
a
month
at
least
of
the
american
stream
so
that
he
went
away
with
his
halo
in
perfect
order
spite
of
all
june
thought
is
wonderful
bit
between
the
teeth
to
know
that
your
hand
is
against
every
one
some
experience
a
sense
of
moral
release
fleur
felt
no
remorse
when
she
left
june
house
reading
condemnatory
resentment
in
her
little
blue
was
glad
that
she
had
fooled
her
despising
june
because
that
elderly
idealist
had
not
seen
what
she
was
after
end
it
forsooth
she
would
soon
show
them
all
that
she
was
only
just
beginning
and
she
smiled
to
herself
on
the
top
of
the
bus
which
carried
her
back
to
mayfair
but
the
smile
died
squeezed
out
by
spasms
of
anticipation
and
anxiety
would
she
be
able
to
manage
jon
she
had
taken
the
bit
between
her
teeth
but
could
she
make
him
take
it
too
she
knew
the
truth
and
the
real
danger
of
knew
neither
therein
lay
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
tell
him
she
thought
it
really
be
safer
this
hideous
luck
had
no
right
to
spoil
their
love
he
must
see
that
they
could
not
let
it
people
always
accepted
an
accomplished
fact
in
time
from
that
piece
of
enough
at
her
passed
to
another
consideration
less
philosophic
if
she
persuaded
jon
to
a
quick
and
secret
marriage
and
he
found
out
afterward
that
she
had
known
the
truth
what
then
jon
hated
subterfuge
again
then
would
it
not
be
better
to
tell
him
but
the
memory
of
his
mother
face
kept
intruding
on
that
impulse
fleur
was
afraid
his
mother
had
power
over
him
more
power
perhaps
than
she
herself
who
could
tell
it
was
too
great
a
risk
in
these
instinctive
calculations
she
was
carried
on
past
green
street
as
far
as
the
ritz
hotel
she
got
down
there
and
walked
back
on
the
green
park
side
the
storm
had
washed
every
tree
they
still
dripped
heavy
drops
fell
on
to
her
frills
and
to
avoid
them
she
crossed
over
under
the
eyes
of
the
iseeum
club
chancing
to
look
up
she
saw
monsieur
profond
with
a
tall
stout
man
in
the
bay
window
turning
into
green
street
she
heard
her
name
called
and
saw
that
prowler
coming
up
he
took
off
his
glossy
bowler
such
as
she
particularly
detested
good
evenin
miss
forsyde
is
there
a
small
thing
i
can
do
for
you
yes
pass
by
on
the
other
i
say
why
do
you
dislike
me
do
i
it
looks
like
well
then
because
you
make
me
feel
life
is
worth
monsieur
profond
smiled
look
here
miss
forsyde
do
worry
it
be
all
right
nothing
things
do
last
cried
fleur
with
me
likes
and
well
that
makes
me
a
bit
i
should
have
thought
nothing
could
ever
make
you
happy
or
i
do
like
to
annoy
other
people
i
goin
on
my
fleur
looked
at
him
startled
where
small
voyage
to
the
south
seas
or
somewhere
said
monsieur
profond
fleur
suffered
relief
and
a
sense
of
insult
clearly
he
meant
to
convey
that
he
was
breaking
with
her
mother
how
dared
he
have
anything
to
break
and
yet
how
dared
he
break
it
miss
forsyde
remember
me
to
dartie
i
not
so
bad
really
fleur
left
him
standing
there
with
his
hat
raised
stealing
a
look
round
she
saw
him
and
toward
his
club
ca
even
love
with
conviction
she
thought
will
mother
do
her
dreams
that
night
were
endless
and
uneasy
she
rose
heavy
and
unrested
and
went
at
once
to
the
study
of
whitaker
almanac
a
forsyte
is
instinctively
aware
that
facts
are
the
real
crux
of
any
situation
she
might
conquer
jon
prejudice
but
without
exact
machinery
to
complete
their
desperate
resolve
nothing
would
happen
from
the
invaluable
tome
she
learned
that
they
must
each
be
or
some
one
consent
would
be
necessary
which
of
course
was
unobtainable
then
she
became
lost
in
directions
concerning
licenses
certificates
notices
districts
coming
finally
to
the
word
but
that
was
nonsense
who
would
really
mind
their
giving
wrong
ages
in
order
to
be
married
for
love
she
ate
hardly
any
breakfast
and
went
back
to
whitaker
the
more
she
studied
the
less
sure
she
became
till
idly
turning
the
pages
she
came
to
scotland
people
could
be
married
there
without
any
of
this
nonsense
she
had
only
to
go
and
stay
there
days
then
jon
could
come
and
in
front
of
two
people
they
could
declare
themselves
married
and
what
was
would
be
it
was
far
the
best
way
and
at
once
she
ran
over
her
schoolfellows
there
was
mary
lambe
who
lived
in
edinburgh
and
was
quite
a
sport
she
had
a
brother
too
she
could
stay
with
mary
lambe
who
with
her
brother
would
serve
for
witnesses
she
well
knew
that
some
girls
would
think
all
this
unnecessary
and
that
all
she
and
jon
need
do
was
to
go
away
together
for
a
weekend
and
then
say
to
their
people
we
are
married
by
nature
we
must
now
be
married
by
but
fleur
was
forsyte
enough
to
feel
such
a
proceeding
dubious
and
to
dread
her
father
face
when
he
heard
of
it
besides
she
did
not
believe
that
jon
would
do
it
he
had
an
opinion
of
her
such
as
she
could
not
bear
to
diminish
no
mary
lambe
was
preferable
and
it
was
just
the
time
of
year
to
go
to
scotland
more
at
ease
now
she
packed
avoided
her
aunt
and
took
a
bus
to
chiswick
she
was
too
early
and
went
on
to
kew
gardens
she
found
no
peace
among
its
labelled
trees
and
broad
green
spaces
and
having
lunched
off
sandwiches
and
coffee
returned
to
chiswick
and
rang
june
bell
the
austrian
admitted
her
to
the
little
now
that
she
knew
what
she
and
jon
were
up
against
her
longing
for
him
had
increased
tenfold
as
if
he
were
a
toy
with
sharp
edges
or
dangerous
paint
such
as
they
had
tried
to
take
from
her
as
a
child
if
she
could
not
have
her
way
and
get
jon
for
good
and
all
she
felt
like
dying
of
privation
by
hook
or
crook
she
must
and
would
get
him
a
round
dim
mirror
of
very
old
glass
hung
over
the
pink
brick
hearth
she
stood
looking
at
herself
reflected
in
it
pale
and
rather
dark
under
the
eyes
little
shudders
kept
passing
through
her
nerves
then
she
heard
the
bell
ring
and
stealing
to
the
window
saw
him
standing
on
the
doorstep
smoothing
his
hair
and
lips
as
if
he
too
were
trying
to
subdue
the
fluttering
of
his
nerves
she
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
two
chairs
with
her
back
to
the
door
when
he
came
in
and
she
said
at
sit
down
jon
i
want
to
talk
jon
sat
on
the
table
by
her
side
and
without
looking
at
him
she
went
on
if
you
do
want
to
lose
me
we
must
get
jon
gasped
why
is
there
anything
new
no
but
i
felt
it
at
robin
hill
and
among
my
stammered
jon
at
robin
was
all
they
said
nothing
to
but
they
mean
to
stop
us
your
mother
face
was
enough
and
my
have
you
seen
him
since
fleur
nodded
what
mattered
a
few
supplementary
lies
but
said
jon
eagerly
i
ca
see
how
they
can
feel
like
that
after
all
these
fleur
looked
up
at
him
perhaps
you
do
love
me
not
love
you
enough
then
make
sure
of
without
telling
them
not
till
jon
was
silent
how
much
older
he
looked
than
on
that
day
barely
two
months
ago
when
she
first
saw
two
years
older
it
would
hurt
mother
awfully
he
said
fleur
drew
her
hand
away
you
got
to
jon
slid
off
the
table
on
to
his
knees
but
why
not
tell
them
they
ca
really
stop
us
fleur
they
can
i
tell
you
they
how
we
utterly
putting
money
pressure
and
all
sorts
of
other
pressure
i
not
patient
but
it
deceiving
fleur
got
up
you
ca
really
love
me
or
you
would
hesitate
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
lifting
his
hands
to
her
waist
jon
forced
her
to
sit
down
again
she
hurried
on
i
planned
it
all
out
we
only
to
go
to
scotland
when
married
they
soon
come
round
people
always
come
round
to
facts
do
you
see
jon
but
to
hurt
them
so
awfully
so
he
would
rather
hurt
her
than
those
people
of
his
all
right
then
let
me
go
jon
got
up
and
put
his
back
against
the
door
i
expect
you
right
he
said
slowly
but
i
want
to
think
it
she
could
see
that
he
was
seething
with
feelings
he
wanted
to
express
but
she
did
not
mean
to
help
him
she
hated
herself
at
this
moment
and
almost
hated
him
why
had
she
to
do
all
the
work
to
secure
their
love
it
was
fair
and
then
she
saw
his
eyes
adoring
and
distressed
do
look
like
that
i
only
do
want
to
lose
you
you
ca
lose
me
so
long
as
you
want
oh
yes
i
jon
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
fleur
do
you
know
anything
you
have
told
me
it
was
the
question
she
had
dreaded
she
looked
straight
at
him
and
answered
she
had
burnt
her
boats
but
what
did
it
matter
if
she
got
him
he
would
forgive
her
and
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
kissed
him
on
the
lips
she
was
winning
she
felt
it
in
the
beating
of
his
heart
against
her
in
the
closing
of
his
eyes
i
want
to
make
sure
i
want
to
make
sure
she
whispered
promise
jon
did
not
answer
his
face
had
the
stillness
of
extreme
trouble
at
last
he
said
it
like
hitting
them
i
must
think
a
little
fleur
i
really
fleur
slipped
out
of
his
arms
oh
very
well
and
suddenly
she
burst
into
tears
of
disappointment
shame
and
overstrain
followed
five
minutes
of
acute
misery
remorse
and
tenderness
knew
no
bounds
but
he
did
not
promise
despite
her
will
to
cry
very
well
then
if
you
do
love
me
she
dared
not
from
birth
accustomed
to
her
own
way
this
check
from
one
so
young
so
tender
so
devoted
baffled
and
surprised
her
she
wanted
to
push
him
away
from
her
to
try
what
anger
and
coldness
would
do
and
again
she
dared
not
the
knowledge
that
she
was
scheming
to
rush
him
blindfold
into
the
irrevocable
weakened
the
sincerity
of
pique
and
the
sincerity
of
passion
even
her
kisses
had
not
the
lure
she
wished
for
them
that
stormy
little
meeting
ended
inconclusively
will
you
some
tea
gnadiges
fraulein
pushing
jon
from
her
she
cried
out
thank
you
i
just
and
before
he
could
prevent
her
she
was
gone
she
went
stealthily
mopping
her
gushed
stained
cheeks
frightened
angry
very
miserable
she
had
stirred
jon
up
so
fearfully
yet
nothing
definite
was
promised
or
arranged
but
the
more
uncertain
and
hazardous
the
future
the
more
the
will
to
have
worked
its
tentacles
into
the
flesh
of
her

burrowing
tick

at
green
street
winifred

gone
with
imogen
to
see
a
play
which
some
said
was
allegorical
and
others
very
exciting
do
you
it
was
because
of
what
others
said
that
winifred
and
imogen
had
gone
fleur
went
on
to
paddington
through
the
carriage
the
air
from
the
of
west
drayton
and
the
late
hayfields
fanned
her
still
gushed
cheeks
flowers
had
seemed
to
be
had
for
the
picking
now
they
were
all
thorned
and
prickled
but
the
golden
flower
within
the
crown
of
spikes
seemed
to
her
tenacious
spirit
all
the
fairer
and
more
desirable
fat
in
the
fire
on
reaching
home
fleur
found
an
atmosphere
so
peculiar
that
it
penetrated
even
the
perplexed
aura
of
her
own
private
life
her
mother
was
inaccessibly
entrenched
in
a
brown
study
her
father
contemplating
fate
in
the
vinery
neither
of
them
had
a
word
to
throw
to
a
dog
it
because
of
me
thought
fleur
because
of
profond
to
her
mother
she
said
what
the
matter
with
father
her
mother
answered
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
to
her
father
what
the
matter
with
mother
her
father
answered

what
should
be
the
matter
and
gave
her
a
sharp
look
by
the
way
murmured
fleur
monsieur
profond
is
going
a
voyage
on
his
yacht
to
the
south
soames
examined
a
branch
on
which
no
grapes
were
growing
this
vine
a
failure
he
said
i
had
young
mont
here
he
asked
me
something
about
oh
how
do
you
like
him
father
a
all
these
young
what
were
you
at
his
age
dear
soames
smiled
grimly
we
went
to
work
and
did
play
and
motoring
and
making
did
you
ever
make
love
she
avoided
looking
at
him
while
she
said
that
but
she
saw
him
well
enough
his
pale
face
had
reddened
his
eyebrows
where
darkness
was
still
mingled
with
the
grey
had
come
close
together
i
had
no
time
or
inclination
to
perhaps
you
had
a
grand
soames
looked
at
her
intently
you
want
to
much
good
it
did
he
moved
away
along
by
the
pipes
fleur
tiptoed
silently
after
him
tell
me
about
it
father
soames
became
very
still
what
should
you
want
to
know
about
such
things
at
your
age
is
she
alive
he
nodded
and
married
it
jon
forsyte
mother
is
it
and
she
was
your
wife
it
was
said
in
a
flash
of
intuition
surely
his
opposition
came
from
his
anxiety
that
she
should
not
know
of
that
old
wound
to
his
pride
but
she
was
startled
to
see
some
one
so
old
and
calm
wince
as
if
struck
to
hear
so
sharp
a
note
of
pain
in
his
voice
who
told
you
that
if
your
aunt
i
ca
bear
the
affair
talked
but
darling
said
fleur
softly
it
so
long
long
ago
or
not
i
fleur
stood
stroking
his
arm
i
tried
to
forget
he
said
suddenly
i
do
wish
to
be
and
then
as
if
venting
some
long
and
secret
irritation
he
added
in
these
days
people
do
understand
grand
passion
indeed
no
one
knows
what
it
i
do
said
fleur
almost
in
a
whisper
soames
who
had
turned
his
back
on
her
spun
round
what
are
you
talking
child
like
you
perhaps
i
inherited
it
what
for
her
son
you
he
was
pale
as
a
sheet
and
she
knew
that
she
was
as
bad
they
stood
staring
at
each
other
in
the
steamy
heat
redolent
of
the
mushy
scent
of
earth
of
potted
geranium
and
of
vines
coming
along
fast
this
is
crazy
said
soames
at
last
between
dry
lips
scarcely
moving
her
own
she
murmured
do
be
angry
father
i
ca
help
but
she
could
see
he
was
angry
only
scared
deeply
scared
i
thought
that
foolishness
he
stammered
was
all
oh
no
it
ten
times
what
it
soames
kicked
at
the
pipe
the
hapless
movement
touched
her
who
had
no
fear
of
her
dearest
she
said
what
must
be
must
you
must
repeated
soames
you
do
know
what
you
talking
of
has
that
boy
been
told
the
blood
rushed
into
her
cheeks
not
he
had
turned
from
her
again
and
with
one
shoulder
a
little
raised
stood
staring
fixedly
at
a
joint
in
the
pipes
it
most
distasteful
to
me
he
said
suddenly
nothing
could
be
more
so
son
of
that
fellow
she
had
noted
almost
unconsciously
that
he
did
not
say
son
of
that
woman
and
again
her
intuition
began
working
did
the
ghost
of
that
grand
passion
linger
in
some
corner
of
his
heart
she
slipped
her
hand
under
his
arm
jon
father
is
quite
ill
and
old
i
saw
yes
i
went
there
with
jon
i
saw
them
well
and
what
did
they
say
to
you
nothing
they
were
very
they
would
he
resumed
his
contemplation
of
the
and
then
said
suddenly
i
must
think
this
speak
to
you
again
she
knew
this
was
final
for
the
moment
and
stole
away
leaving
him
still
looking
at
the
she
wandered
into
the
among
the
raspberry
and
currant
bushes
without
impetus
to
pick
and
eat
two
months
was
even
two
days
before
prosper
profond
told
her
now
she
felt
tangled
in
a
passions
vested
rights
oppressions
and
revolts
the
ties
of
love
and
hate
at
this
dark
moment
of
discouragement
there
seemed
even
to
her
nature
no
way
out
how
deal
with
sway
and
bend
things
to
her
will
and
get
her
heart
desire
and
suddenly
round
the
corner
of
the
high
box
hedge
she
came
plump
on
her
mother
walking
swiftly
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
her
bosom
was
heaving
her
eyes
dilated
her
cheeks
flushed
instantly
fleur
thought
yacht
poor
mother
annette
gave
her
a
wide
startled
look
and
said
la
i
awfully
sorry
oh
yes
you
and
your
but
am
i
know
what
it
feels
annette
startled
eyes
grew
wide
till
the
whites
showed
above
them
poor
innocent
she
said
her
and
look
and
speak
like
this
it
was
all
frightening
her
father
her
mother
herself
and
only
two
months
back
they
had
seemed
to
have
everything
they
wanted
in
this
world
annette
crumpled
the
letter
in
her
hand
fleur
knew
that
she
must
ignore
the
sight
ca
i
do
anything
for
your
head
mother
annette
shook
that
head
and
walked
on
swaying
her
hips
cruel
thought
fleur
i
was
glad
that
man
what
do
men
come
prowling
for
disturbing
everything
i
suppose
he
tired
of
her
what
business
has
he
to
be
tired
of
my
mother
what
business
and
at
that
thought
so
natural
and
so
peculiar
she
uttered
a
little
choked
laugh
she
ought
of
course
to
be
delighted
but
what
was
there
to
be
delighted
at
her
father
did
really
care
her
mother
did
perhaps
she
entered
the
orchard
and
sat
down
under
a
a
breeze
sighed
in
the
higher
boughs
the
sky
seen
through
their
green
was
very
blue
and
very
white
in
heavy
white
clouds
almost
always
present
in
river
landscape
bees
sheltering
out
of
the
wind
hummed
softly
and
over
the
lush
grass
fell
the
thick
shade
from
those
planted
by
her
father
years
ago
birds
were
almost
silent
the
cuckoos
had
ceased
to
sing
but
were
cooing
the
breath
and
drone
and
cooing
of
high
summer
were
not
for
long
a
sedative
to
her
excited
nerves
crouched
over
her
knees
she
began
to
scheme
her
father
must
be
made
to
back
her
up
why
should
he
mind
so
long
as
she
was
happy
she
had
not
lived
for
nearly
nineteen
years
without
knowing
that
her
future
was
all
he
really
cared
about
she
had
then
only
to
convince
him
that
her
future
could
not
be
happy
without
jon
he
thought
it
a
mad
fancy
how
foolish
the
old
were
thinking
they
could
tell
what
the
young
felt
had
not
he
confessed
that
loved
with
a
grand
passion
he
ought
to
understand
piles
up
his
money
for
me
she
thought
what
the
use
if
i
not
going
to
be
happy
money
and
all
it
bought
did
not
bring
happiness
love
only
brought
that
the
daisies
in
this
orchard
which
gave
it
such
a
moony
look
sometimes
grew
wild
and
happy
and
had
their
hour
ought
to
have
called
me
fleur
she
mused
they
did
mean
me
to
have
my
hour
and
be
happy
while
it
lasts
nothing
real
stood
in
the
way
like
poverty
or
only
a
ghost
from
the
unhappy
past
jon
was
right
they
would
let
you
live
these
old
people
they
made
mistakes
committed
crimes
and
wanted
their
children
to
go
on
paying
the
breeze
died
away
midges
began
to
bite
she
got
up
plucked
a
piece
of
honeysuckle
and
went
in
it
was
hot
that
night
both
she
and
her
mother
had
put
on
thin
pale
low
frocks
the
dinner
flowers
were
pale
fleur
was
struck
with
the
pale
look
of
everything
her
father
face
her
mother
shoulders
the
pale
panelled
walls
the
pale
grey
velvety
carpet
the
even
the
soup
was
pale
there
was
not
one
spot
of
colour
in
the
room
not
even

that

pale
and
silent

that
dinner
in
the

her
father
called
her
back
as
she
was
following
her
mother
out
she
sat
down
beside
him
at
the
table
and
unpinning
the
pale
honeysuckle
put
it
to
her
nose
i
been
thinking
he
said
yes
dear
it
extremely
painful
for
me
to
talk
but
there
no
help
for
it
i
do
know
if
you
understand
how
much
you
are
to
me
i
never
spoken
of
it
i
did
think
it
necessary
you
everything
your
he
paused
staring
at
his
of
venetian
glass
yes
i
only
you
to
look
to
i
never
wanted
anything
else
since
you
were

know

moistened
his
lips
you
may
think
this
a
matter
i
can
smooth
over
and
arrange
for
you
you
mistaken
i
fleur
did
not
speak
quite
apart
from
my
own
feelings
went
on
soames
with
more
resolution
those
two
are
not
amenable
to
anything
i
can
say
hate
me
as
people
always
hate
those
whom
they
have
but
he
their
flesh
and
blood
her
only
child
probably
he
means
to
her
what
you
mean
to
me
it
a
no

fleur
no
father
soames
leaned
back
the
image
of
pale
patience
as
if
resolved
on
the
betrayal
of
no
emotion
listen
he
said
you
putting
the
feelings
of
two
the
feelings
of
years
what
chance
do
you
think
you
have
two
very
first
love
affair
a
matter
of
half
a
dozen
meetings
a
few
walks
and
talks
a
few
against
what
you
ca
imagine
what
no
one
could
who
has
been
through
it
come
be
reasonable
fleur
it
midsummer
madness
fleur
tore
the
honeysuckle
into
little
slow
bits
the
madness
is
in
letting
the
past
spoil
it
all
what
do
we
care
about
the
past
it
our
lives
not
soames
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
where
suddenly
she
saw
moisture
shining
whose
child
are
you
he
said
whose
child
is
he
the
present
is
linked
with
the
past
the
future
with
both
there
no
getting
away
from
she
had
never
heard
philosophy
pass
those
lips
before
impressed
even
in
her
agitation
she
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
chin
on
her
hands
but
father
consider
it
practically
we
want
each
other
there
ever
so
much
money
and
nothing
whatever
in
the
way
but
sentiment
let
bury
the
past
his
answer
was
a
sigh
besides
said
fleur
gently
you
ca
prevent
i
do
suppose
said
soames
that
if
left
to
myself
i
should
try
to
prevent
you
i
must
put
up
with
things
i
know
to
keep
your
affection
but
it
not
i
who
control
this
matter
that
what
i
want
you
to
realise
before
it
too
late
if
you
go
on
thinking
you
can
get
your
way
and
encourage
this
feeling
the
blow
will
be
much
heavier
when
you
find
you
oh
cried
fleur
help
me
father
you
can
help
me
you
soames
made
a
startled
movement
of
negation
i
he
said
bitterly
help
i
am
the
just
cause
and
that
the
jargon
you
have
my
blood
in
your
he
rose
well
the
fat
in
the
fire
if
you
persist
in
your
wilfulness
have
yourself
to
blame
come
do
be
foolish
my
only
child
fleur
laid
her
forehead
against
his
shoulder
all
was
in
such
turmoil
within
her
but
no
good
to
show
it
no
good
at
all
she
broke
away
from
him
and
went
out
into
the
twilight
distraught
but
unconvinced
all
was
indeterminate
and
vague
within
her
like
the
shapes
and
shadows
in
the
garden
will
to
have
a
poplar
pierced
up
into
the
sky
and
touched
a
white
star
there
the
dew
wetted
her
shoes
and
chilled
her
bare
shoulders
she
went
down
to
the
river
bank
and
stood
gazing
at
a
moonstreak
on
the
darkening
water
suddenly
she
smelled
tobacco
smoke
and
a
white
figure
emerged
as
if
created
by
the
moon
it
was
young
mont
in
flannels
standing
in
his
boat
she
heard
the
tiny
hiss
of
his
cigarette
extinguished
in
the
water
fleur
came
his
voice
do
be
hard
on
a
poor
devil
i
been
waiting
for
what
come
in
my
boat
not
why
not
i
not
a
have
you
any
romance
in
you
do
be
modern
fleur
he
appeared
on
the
path
within
a
yard
of
her
go
away
fleur
i
love
you
fleur
fleur
uttered
a
short
laugh
come
again
she
said
when
i
have
got
my
what
is
your
wish
ask
fleur
said
mont
and
his
voice
sounded
strange
do
mock
me
even
vivisected
dogs
are
worth
decent
treatment
before
they
cut
up
for
fleur
shook
her
head
but
her
lips
were
trembling
well
you
should
make
me
jump
give
me
a
mont
gave
her
one
lighted
it
and
another
for
himself
i
do
want
to
talk
rot
he
said
but
please
imagine
all
the
rot
that
all
the
lovers
that
ever
were
have
talked
and
all
my
special
rot
thrown
thank
you
i
have
imagined
it
they
stood
for
a
moment
facing
each
other
in
the
shadow
of
an
with
very
moonlit
blossoms
and
the
smoke
from
their
cigarettes
mingled
in
the
air
between
them
also
ran
he
said
fleur
turned
abruptly
toward
the
house
on
the
lawn
she
stopped
to
look
back
michael
mont
was
whirling
his
arms
above
him
she
could
see
them
dashing
at
his
head
then
waving
at
the
moonlit
blossoms
of
the
acacia
his
voice
just
reached
her
fleur
shook
herself
she
could
help
him
she
had
too
much
trouble
of
her
own
on
the
verandah
she
stopped
very
suddenly
again
her
mother
was
sitting
in
the
at
her
writing
bureau
quite
alone
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
expression
of
her
face
except
its
utter
immobility
but
she
looked
desolate
fleur
went
upstairs
at
the
door
of
her
room
she
paused
she
could
hear
her
father
walking
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
she
thought
jolly
oh
jon
when
fleur
left
him
jon
stared
at
the
austrian
she
was
a
thin
woman
with
a
dark
face
and
the
concerned
expression
of
one
who
has
watched
every
little
good
that
life
once
had
slip
from
her
one
by
one
no
tea
she
said
susceptible
to
the
disappointment
in
her
voice
jon
murmured
no
really
a
lil
ready
a
lil
cup
and
fleur
was
gone
hours
of
remorse
and
indecision
lay
before
him
and
with
a
heavy
sense
of
disproportion
he
smiled
and
said
you
she
brought
in
a
little
pot
of
tea
with
two
little
cups
and
a
silver
box
of
cigarettes
on
a
little
tray
sugar
miss
forsyte
has
much

veree

brother
yes
said
jon
beginning
to
puff
the
second
cigarette
of
his
life
very
young
brother
said
the
austrian
with
a
little
anxious
smile
which
reminded
him
of
the
wag
of
a
dog
tail
may
i
give
you
some
he
said
and
wo
you
sit
down
please
the
austrian
shook
her
head

very
nice
old
most
nice
old
man

miss
forsyte

her
words
fell
on
jon
like
a
reproach
oh

said
the
austrian
putting
a
hand
on
her
heart
he
have
veree
kind
yes
said
jon
and
again
her
words
seemed
to
him
a
reproach
he
never
give

trouble
to
no
one
and
smile
so
yes
does
he
he

photograph
on
his

beautiful
jon
gulped
down
his
tea
this
woman
with
her
concerned
face
and
her
reminding
words
was
like
the
first
and
second
murderers
thank
you
he
said
i
must
go
now
i
leave
this
with
you
he
put
a
note
on
the
tray
with
a
doubting
hand
and
gained
the
door
he
heard
the
austrian
gasp
and
hurried
out
he
had
just
time
to
catch
his
train
and
all
the
way
to
victoria
looked
at
every
face
that
passed
as
lovers
will
hoping
against
hope
on
reaching
worthing
he
put
his
luggage
into
the
local
train
and
set
out
across
the
downs
for
wansdon
trying
to
walk
off
his
aching
irresolution
so
long
as
he
went
full
bat
he
could
enjoy
the
beauty
of
those
green
slopes
stopping
now
and
again
to
sprawl
on
the
grass
admire
the
perfection
of
a
wild
rose
or
listen
to
a
lark
song
but
the
war
of
motives
within
him
was
but
longing
for
fleur
and
the
hatred
of
deception
he
came
to
the
old
above
wansdon
with
his
mind
no
more
made
up
than
when
he
started
to
see
both
sides
of
a
question
vigorously
was
at
once
jon
strength
and
weakness
he
tramped
in
just
as
the
first
rang
his
things
had
already
been
brought
up
he
had
a
hurried
bath
and
came
down
to
find
holly
had
gone
to
town
and
would
not
be
back
till
the
last
train
since
val
advice
to
him
to
ask
his
sister
what
was
the
matter
between
the
two
families
so
much
had
disclosure
in
the
green
park
her
visit
to
robin
hill
there
seemed
nothing
to
ask
he
talked
of
spain
his
sunstroke
val
horses
their
father
health
holly
startled
him
by
saying
that
she
thought
their
father
not
at
all
well
she
had
been
twice
to
robin
hill
for
the
he
had
seemed
fearfully
languid
sometimes
even
in
pain
but
had
always
refused
to
talk
about
himself
he
awfully
dear
and
you
think
jon
feeling
far
from
dear
and
unselfish
himself
jon
answered
rather
i
think
he
been
a
simply
perfect
father
so
long
as
i
can
yes
answered
jon
very
subdued
he
never
interfered
and
he
always
seemed
to
understand
i
shall
never
forget
his
letting
me
go
to
south
africa
in
the
boer
war
when
i
was
in
love
with
that
was
before
he
married
mother
was
it
said
jon
suddenly
yes
why
oh
nothing
only
was
she
engaged
to
fleur
father
first
holly
put
down
the
spoon
she
was
using
and
raised
her
eyes
her
stare
was
circumspect
what
did
the
boy
know
enough
to
make
it
better
to
tell
him
she
could
not
decide
he
looked
strained
and
worried
altogether
older
but
that
might
be
the
sunstroke
there
was
something
she
said
of
course
we
were
out
there
and
got
no
news
of
she
could
not
take
the
risk
it
was
not
her
secret
besides
she
was
in
the
dark
about
his
feelings
now
before
spain
she
had
made
sure
he
was
in
love
but
boys
were
boys
that
was
seven
weeks
ago
and
all
spain
between
she
saw
that
he
knew
she
was
putting
him
off
and
added
have
you
heard
anything
of
fleur
his
face
told
her
then
more
than
the
most
elaborate
explanations
so
he
had
not
forgotten
she
said
very
quietly
fleur
is
awfully
attractive
jon
but
you
and
i
do
really
like
her
very
why
we
think
she
got
rather
a
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
pushed
his
dessert
plate
away
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
holly
too
got
up
and
put
her
arm
round
his
waist
do
be
angry
jon
dear
we
ca
all
see
people
in
the
same
light
can
we
you
know
i
believe
each
of
us
only
has
about
one
or
two
people
who
can
see
the
best
that
in
us
and
bring
it
out
for
you
i
think
it
your
mother
i
once
saw
her
looking
at
a
letter
of
yours
it
was
wonderful
to
see
her
face
i
think
she
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
does
seem
to
touch
jon
face
softened
then
again
became
tense
was
against
him
and
fleur
it
all
strengthened
the
appeal
of
her
words
make
sure
of
me
jon
here
where
he
had
passed
that
wonderful
week
with
tug
of
her
enchantment
the
ache
in
his
heart
increased
with
every
minute
that
she
was
not
there
to
make
the
room
the
garden
the
very
air
magical
would
he
ever
be
able
to
live
down
here
not
seeing
her
and
he
closed
up
utterly
going
early
to
bed
it
would
not
make
him
healthy
wealthy
and
wise
but
it
closeted
him
with
memory
of
fleur
in
her
fancy
frock
he
heard
val
ford
discharging
cargo
then
the
stillness
of
the
summer
night
stole
only
the
bleating
of
very
distant
sheep
and
a
harsh
purring
he
leaned
far
out
cold
downs
like
silver
small
wings
a
stream
bubbling
the
rambler
roses
empty
all
of
it
without
her
in
the
bible
it
was
written
thou
shalt
leave
father
and
mother
and
cleave
let
him
have
pluck
and
go
and
tell
them
they
could
stop
him
marrying
would
want
to
stop
him
when
they
knew
how
he
felt
yes
he
would
go
bold
and
was
wrong
the
ceased
the
sheep
were
silent
the
only
sound
in
the
darkness
was
the
bubbling
of
the
stream
and
jon
in
his
bed
slept
freed
from
the
worst
of
life
prophesies
on
the
day
of
the
cancelled
meeting
at
the
national
gallery
began
the
second
anniversary
of
the
resurrection
of
england
pride
and
more
shortly
the
top
hat
lord
festival
which
the
war
had
driven
from
the
its
light
and
dark
blue
flags
for
the
second
time
displaying
almost
every
feature
of
a
glorious
past
here
in
the
luncheon
interval
were
all
species
of
female
and
one
species
of
male
hat
protecting
the
multiple
types
of
face
associated
with
the
the
observing
forsyte
might
discern
in
the
free
or
unconsidered
seats
a
certain
number
of
the
but
they
hardly
ventured
on
the
grass
the
old
still
rejoice
that
the
proletariat
was
not
yet
paying
the
necessary
here
was
still
a
close
borough
the
only
one
left
on
a
large
the
papers
were
about
to
estimate
the
attendance
at
ten
thousand
and
the
ten
thousand
all
animated
by
one
hope
were
asking
each
other
one
question
where
are
you
lunching
something
wonderfully
uplifting
and
reassuring
in
that
query
and
the
sight
of
so
many
people
like
themselves
voicing
it
what
reserve
power
in
the
british
pigeons
lobsters
lamb
salmon
mayonnaise
strawberries
and
bottles
of
champagne
to
feed
the
lot
no
miracle
in
case
of
seven
loaves
and
a
few
rested
on
surer
foundations
six
thousand
top
hats
four
thousand
parasols
would
be
doffed
and
furled
ten
thousand
mouths
all
speaking
the
same
english
would
be
filled
there
was
life
in
the
old
dog
yet
tradition
and
again
tradition
how
strong
and
how
elastic
wars
might
rage
taxation
prey
trades
unions
take
toll
and
europe
perish
of
starvation
but
the
ten
thousand
would
be
fed
and
within
their
ring
fence
stroll
upon
green
turf
wear
their
top
hats
and
the
heart
was
sound
the
pulse
still
regular
among
the
many
forsytes
present
on
a
theirs
by
personal
prescriptive
right
or
proxy
was
soames
with
his
wife
and
daughter
he
had
not
been
at
either
school
he
took
no
interest
in
cricket
but
he
wanted
fleur
to
show
her
frock
and
he
wanted
to
wear
his
top
hat
parade
it
again
in
peace
and
plenty
among
his
peers
he
walked
sedately
with
fleur
between
him
and
annette
no
women
equalled
them
so
far
as
he
could
see
they
could
walk
and
hold
themselves
up
there
was
substance
in
their
good
looks
the
modern
woman
had
no
build
no
chest
no
anything
he
remembered
suddenly
with
what
intoxication
of
pride
he
had
walked
round
with
irene
in
the
first
years
of
his
first
marriage
and
how
they
used
to
lunch
on
the
drag
which
his
mother
would
make
his
father
have
because
it
was
so
chic
drags
and
carriages
in
those
days
not
these
lumbering
great
stands
and
how
consistently
montague
dartie
had
drunk
too
much
he
supposed
that
people
drank
too
much
still
but
there
was
not
the
scope
for
it
there
used
to
be
he
remembered
george
brothers
roger
and
eustace
had
been
at
harrow
and
up
on
the
top
of
the
drag
waving
a
flag
with
one
hand
and
a
flag
with
the
other
and
shouting
just
when
everybody
was
silent
like
the
buffoon
he
had
always
been
and
eustace
got
up
to
the
nines
below
too
dandified
to
wear
any
colour
or
take
any
notice
h
old
days
and
irene
in
grey
silk
shot
with
palest
green
he
looked
sideways
at
fleur
face
rather
light
no
eagerness
that
love
affair
was
preying
on
bad
business
he
looked
beyond
at
his
wife
face
rather
more
touched
up
than
usual
a
little
that
she
had
any
business
to
disdain
so
far
as
he
could
see
she
was
taking
profond
defection
with
curious
quietude
or
was
his
small
voyage
just
a
blind
if
so
he
should
refuse
to
see
it
having
promenaded
round
the
pitch
and
in
front
of
the
pavilion
they
sought
winifred
table
in
the
bedouin
club
tent
this
new
cock
and
hen
been
founded
in
the
interests
of
travel
and
of
a
gentleman
with
an
old
scottish
name
whose
father
had
somewhat
strangely
been
called
levi
winifred
had
joined
not
because
she
had
travelled
but
because
instinct
told
her
that
a
club
with
such
a
name
and
such
a
founder
was
bound
to
go
far
if
one
did
join
at
once
one
might
never
have
the
chance
its
tent
with
a
text
from
the
koran
on
an
orange
ground
and
a
small
green
camel
embroidered
over
the
entrance
was
the
most
striking
on
the
ground
outside
it
they
found
jack
cardigan
in
a
dark
blue
tie
he
had
once
played
for
harrow
batting
with
a
malacca
cane
to
show
how
that
fellow
ought
to
have
hit
that
ball
he
piloted
them
in
assembled
in
winifred
corner
were
imogen
benedict
with
his
young
wife
val
dartie
without
holly
maud
and
her
husband
and
after
soames
and
his
two
were
seated
one
empty
place
i
expecting
prosper
said
winifred
but
he
so
busy
with
his
soames
stole
a
glance
no
movement
in
his
wife
face
whether
that
fellow
were
coming
or
not
she
evidently
knew
all
about
it
it
did
not
escape
him
that
fleur
too
looked
at
her
mother
if
annette
respect
his
feelings
she
might
think
of
fleur
the
conversation
very
desultory
was
syncopated
by
jack
cardigan
talking
about
he
cited
all
the
great
from
the
beginning
of
time
as
if
they
had
been
a
definite
racial
entity
in
the
composition
of
the
british
people
soames
had
finished
his
lobster
and
was
beginning
on
when
he
heard
the
words
i
a
small
bit
late
dartie
and
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
empty
place
that
fellow
was
sitting
between
annette
and
imogen
soames
ate
steadily
on
with
an
occasional
word
to
maud
and
winifred
conversation
buzzed
around
him
he
heard
the
voice
of
profond
say
i
think
you
mistaken
forsyde
bet
miss
forsyde
agrees
with
in
what
came
fleur
clear
voice
across
the
table
i
was
sayin
young
gurls
are
much
the
same
as
they
always
very
small
do
you
know
so
much
about
them
that
sharp
reply
caught
the
ears
of
all
and
soames
moved
uneasily
on
his
thin
green
chair
well
i
do
know
i
think
they
want
their
own
small
way
and
i
think
they
always
indeed
oh
winifred
interjected
comfortably
the
girls
in
the
girls
who
been
in
munitions
the
little
flappers
in
the
shops
their
manners
now
really
quite
hit
you
in
the
at
the
word
hit
jack
cardigan
stopped
his
disquisition
and
in
the
silence
monsieur
profond
said
it
was
inside
before
now
it
outside
that
but
their
morals
cried
imogen
just
as
moral
as
they
ever
were
cardigan
but
they
got
more
the
saying
so
cryptically
cynical
received
a
little
laugh
from
imogen
a
slight
opening
of
jack
cardigan
mouth
and
a
creak
from
chair
winifred
said
that
too
bad
what
do
you
say
forsyde
do
you
think
human
nature
always
the
same
soames
subdued
a
sudden
longing
to
get
up
and
kick
the
fellow
he
heard
his
wife
reply
human
nature
is
not
the
same
in
england
as
anywhere
that
was
her
confounded
mockery
well
i
do
know
much
about
this
small
country
thank
god
thought
but
i
should
say
the
pot
was
boilin
under
the
lid
everywhere
we
all
want
pleasure
and
we
always
damn
the
fellow
his
cynicism
outrageous
when
lunch
was
over
they
broke
up
into
couples
for
the
digestive
promenade
too
proud
to
notice
soames
knew
perfectly
that
annette
and
that
fellow
had
gone
prowling
round
together
fleur
was
with
val
she
had
chosen
him
no
doubt
because
he
knew
that
boy
he
himself
had
winifred
for
partner
they
walked
in
the
bright
circling
stream
a
little
flushed
and
sated
for
some
minutes
till
winifred
sighed
i
wish
we
were
back
forty
years
old
boy
before
the
eyes
of
her
spirit
an
interminable
procession
of
her
own
lord
frocks
was
passing
paid
for
with
the
money
of
her
father
to
save
a
recurrent
crisis
it
been
very
amusing
after
all
sometimes
i
even
wish
monty
was
back
what
do
you
think
of
people
nowadays
soames
precious
little
style
the
thing
began
to
go
to
pieces
with
bicycles
and
the
war
has
finished
i
wonder
what
coming
said
winifred
in
a
voice
dreamy
from
i
not
at
all
sure
we
sha
go
back
to
crinolines
and
pegtops
look
at
that
dress
soames
shook
his
head
there
money
but
no
faith
in
things
we
do
lay
by
for
the
future
these
all
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
with
there
a
hat
said
winifred
i
do
you
come
to
think
of
the
people
killed
and
all
that
in
the
war
it
rather
wonderful
i
think
there
no
other
says
the
rest
are
all
bankrupt
except
america
and
of
course
her
men
always
took
their
style
in
dress
from
is
that
chap
said
soames
really
going
to
the
south
seas
oh
one
never
knows
where
prosper
going
he
a
sign
of
the
times
muttered
soames
if
you
winifred
hand
gripped
his
arm
do
turn
your
head
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
look
to
your
right
in
the
front
row
of
the
soames
looked
as
best
he
could
under
that
limitation
a
man
in
a
grey
top
hat
with
thin
brown
folded
cheeks
and
a
certain
elegance
of
posture
sat
there
with
a
woman
in
a
frock
whose
dark
eyes
were
fixed
on
himself
soames
looked
quickly
at
his
feet
how
funnily
feet
moved
one
after
the
other
like
that
voice
said
in
his
ear
jolyon
looks
very
ill
but
he
always
had
style
she
her
why
did
you
tell
fleur
about
that
business
i
did
she
picked
it
up
i
always
knew
she
well
it
a
mess
she
set
her
heart
upon
their
the
little
wretch
murmured
winifred
she
tried
to
take
me
in
about
that
what
shall
you
do
soames
be
guided
by
they
moved
on
silent
in
the
almost
solid
crowd
really
said
winifred
suddenly
it
almost
seems
like
fate
only
that
so
look
there
are
george
and
eustace
george
forsyte
lofty
bulk
had
halted
before
them
hallo
soames
he
said
just
met
profond
and
your
wife
you
catch
if
you
put
on
pace
did
you
ever
go
to
see
old
timothy
soames
nodded
and
the
streams
forced
them
apart
i
always
liked
old
george
said
winifred
he
so
i
never
did
said
soames
where
your
seat
i
shall
go
to
mine
fleur
may
be
back
having
seen
winifred
to
her
seat
he
regained
his
own
conscious
of
small
white
distant
figures
running
the
click
of
the
bat
the
cheers
and
no
fleur
and
no
annette
you
could
expect
nothing
of
women
nowadays
they
had
the
vote
they
were
emancipated
and
much
good
it
was
doing
them
so
winifred
would
go
back
would
she
and
put
up
with
dartie
all
over
again
to
have
the
past
once
be
sitting
here
as
he
had
sat
in
and
before
he
was
certain
that
his
marriage
with
irene
had
gone
all
wrong
before
her
antagonism
had
become
so
glaring
that
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
he
could
not
overlook
it
the
sight
of
her
with
that
fellow
had
brought
all
memory
back
even
now
he
could
not
understand
why
she
had
been
so
impracticable
she
could
love
other
men
she
had
it
in
her
to
himself
the
one
person
she
ought
to
have
loved
she
had
chosen
to
refuse
her
heart
it
seemed
to
him
fantastically
as
he
looked
back
that
all
this
modern
relaxation
of
its
forms
and
laws
were
the
same
as
when
he
married
all
this
modern
looseness
had
come
out
of
her
revolt
it
seemed
to
him
fantastically
that
she
had
started
it
till
all
decent
ownership
of
anything
had
gone
or
was
on
the
point
of
going
all
came
from
her
and
pretty
state
of
things
homes
how
could
you
have
them
without
mutual
ownership
not
that
he
had
ever
had
a
real
home
but
had
that
been
his
fault
he
had
done
his
best
and
his
rewards
two
sitting
in
that
stand
and
this
affair
of
fleur
and
overcome
by
loneliness
he
thought
wait
any
longer
they
must
find
their
own
way
back
to
the
they
mean
to
come
hailing
a
cab
outside
the
ground
he
said
drive
me
to
the
bayswater
his
old
aunts
had
never
failed
him
to
them
he
had
meant
an
visitor
though
they
were
gone
there
still
was
timothy
smither
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
mr
soames
i
was
just
taking
the
air
cook
will
be
so
how
is
timothy
not
himself
at
all
these
last
few
days
sir
he
been
talking
a
great
deal
only
this
morning
he
was
saying
brother
james
he
getting
old
his
mind
wanders
soames
and
then
he
will
talk
of
them
he
troubles
about
their
investments
the
other
day
he
said
my
brother
jolyon
wo
look
at
seemed
quite
down
about
it
come
in
soames
come
in
it
such
a
pleasant
change
well
said
soames
just
for
a
few
no
murmured
smither
in
the
hall
where
the
air
had
the
singular
freshness
of
the
outside
day
we
have
been
very
satisfied
with
him
not
all
this
week
he
always
been
one
to
leave
a
titbit
to
the
end
but
ever
since
monday
he
been
eating
it
first
if
you
notice
a
dog
soames
at
its
dinner
it
eats
the
meat
first
we
always
thought
it
such
a
good
sign
of
timothy
at
his
age
to
leave
it
to
the
last
but
now
he
seems
to
have
lost
all
his
and
of
course
it
makes
him
leave
the
rest
the
doctor
does
make
anything
of
it
but
shook
her
he
seems
to
think
he
got
to
eat
it
first
in
case
he
should
get
to
it
that
and
his
talking
makes
us
has
he
said
anything
important
i
should
like
to
say
that
soames
but
he
turned
against
his
will
he
gets
quite
after
having
had
it
out
every
morning
for
years
it
does
seem
funny
he
said
the
other
day
want
my
money
it
gave
me
such
a
turn
because
as
i
said
to
him
nobody
wants
his
money
i
sure
and
it
does
seem
a
pity
he
should
be
thinking
about
money
at
his
time
of
life
i
took
my
courage
in
my
know
timothy
i
said
dear
miss
forsyte
soames
miss
ann
that
trained
never
thought
about
money
i
said
was
all
character
with
her
he
looked
at
me
i
ca
tell
you
how
funny
and
he
said
quite
dry
wants
my
character
think
of
his
saying
a
thing
like
that
but
sometimes
he
say
something
as
sharp
and
sensible
as
soames
who
had
been
staring
at
an
old
print
by
the
thinking
got
value
murmured
i
go
up
and
see
him
cook
with
him
answered
smither
above
her
corsets
she
will
be
pleased
to
see
he
mounted
slowly
with
the
thought
care
to
live
to
be
that
age
on
the
second
floor
he
paused
and
tapped
the
door
was
opened
and
he
saw
the
round
homely
face
of
a
woman
about
sixty
mr
soames
she
said
why
soames
soames
nodded
all
right
cook
and
entered
timothy
was
propped
up
in
bed
with
his
hands
joined
before
his
chest
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
where
a
fly
was
standing
upside
down
soames
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
facing
him
uncle
timothy
he
said
raising
his
voice
uncle
timothy
timothy
eyes
left
the
fly
and
levelled
themselves
on
his
visitor
soames
could
see
his
pale
tongue
passing
over
his
darkish
lips
uncle
timothy
he
said
again
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
is
there
anything
you
like
to
say
ha
said
timothy
i
come
to
look
you
up
and
see
that
everything
all
timothy
nodded
he
seemed
trying
to
get
used
to
the
apparition
before
him
have
you
got
everything
you
want
no
said
timothy
can
i
get
you
anything
no
said
timothy
i
soames
you
know
your
nephew
soames
forsyte
your
brother
timothy
nodded
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
anything
i
can
for
timothy
beckoned
soames
went
close
to
him
said
timothy
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
have
outlived
tone
you
tell
them
all
from
tell
them
and
his
finger
tapped
on
soames
arm
to
hold
are
goin
up
and
he
nodded
thrice
all
right
said
soames
i
yes
said
timothy
and
fixing
his
eyes
again
on
the
ceiling
he
added
that
fly
strangely
moved
soames
looked
at
the
cook
pleasant
fattish
face
all
little
puckers
from
staring
at
fires
that
do
him
a
world
of
good
sir
she
said
a
mutter
came
from
timothy
but
he
was
clearly
speaking
to
himself
and
soames
went
out
with
the
cook
i
wish
i
could
make
you
a
pink
cream
soames
like
in
old
days
you
did
so
relish
them
sir
it
has
been
a
take
care
of
him
cook
he
is
and
shaking
her
crumpled
hand
he
went
smither
was
still
taking
the
air
in
the
doorway
what
do
you
think
of
him
soames
h
soames
murmured
he
lost
yes
said
smither
i
was
afraid
you
think
that
coming
fresh
out
of
the
world
to
see
him
smither
said
soames
we
all
indebted
to
oh
no
soames
do
say
that
it
a
such
a
wonderful
well
said
soames
and
got
into
his
taxi
up
he
thought
up
reaching
the
hotel
at
knightsbridge
he
went
to
their
and
rang
for
tea
neither
of
them
were
in
and
again
that
sense
of
loneliness
came
over
him
these
hotels
what
monstrous
great
places
they
were
now
he
could
remember
when
there
was
nothing
bigger
than
long
or
brown
morley
or
the
tavistock
and
the
heads
that
were
shaken
over
the
langham
and
the
grand
hotels
and
and
hotels
no
end
to
them
now
and
soames
who
had
just
been
watching
at
lord
a
miracle
of
tradition
and
continuity
fell
into
reverie
over
the
changes
in
that
london
where
he
had
been
born
years
before
whether
consols
were
going
up
or
not
london
had
become
a
terrific
property
no
such
property
in
the
world
unless
it
were
new
york
there
was
a
lot
of
hysteria
in
the
papers
nowadays
but
any
one
who
like
himself
could
remember
london
sixty
years
ago
and
see
it
now
realised
the
fecundity
and
elasticity
of
wealth
they
had
only
to
keep
their
heads
and
go
at
it
steadily
why
he
remembered
cobblestones
and
stinking
straw
on
the
floor
of
your
cab
and
old
could
he
not
have
told
them
if
he
had
kept
his
memory
things
were
unsettled
people
in
a
funk
or
in
a
hurry
but
here
were
london
and
the
thames
and
out
there
the
british
empire
and
the
ends
of
the
earth
consols

goin
up
he
should
be
a
bit
surprised
it
was
the
breed
that
counted
and
all
that
was
in
soames
stared
for
a
moment
out
of
his
grey
eyes
till
diverted
by
the
print
of
a
victorian
picture
on
the
walls
the
hotel
had
bought
three
dozen
of
that
little
lot
the
old
hunting
or
progress
prints
in
the
old
inns
were
worth
looking
this
sentimental
victorianism
had
gone
tell
them
to
hold
on
old
timothy
had
said
but
to
what
were
they
to
hold
on
in
this
modern
welter
of
the
democratic
principle
why
even
privacy
was
threatened
and
at
the
thought
that
privacy
might
perish
soames
pushed
back
his
teacup
and
went
to
the
window
fancy
owning
no
more
of
nature
than
the
crowd
out
there
owned
of
the
flowers
and
trees
and
waters
of
hyde
park
no
no
private
possession
underlay
everything
worth
having
the
world
had
slipped
its
sanity
a
bit
as
dogs
now
and
again
at
full
moon
slipped
theirs
and
went
off
for
a
night
rabbiting
but
the
world
like
the
dog
knew
where
its
bread
was
buttered
and
its
bed
warm
and
would
come
back
sure
enough
to
the
only
home
worth
private
ownership
the
world
was
in
its
second
childhood
for
the
moment
like
old
its
titbit
first
he
heard
a
sound
behind
him
and
saw
that
his
wife
and
daughter
had
come
in
so
you
back
he
said
fleur
did
not
answer
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
him
and
her
mother
then
passed
into
her
bedroom
annette
poured
herself
out
a
cup
of
tea
i
am
going
to
paris
to
my
mother
oh
to
your
mother
for
how
long
i
do
not
and
when
are
you
going
on
was
she
really
going
to
her
mother
odd
how
indifferent
he
felt
odd
how
clearly
she
had
perceived
the
indifference
he
would
feel
so
long
as
there
was
no
scandal
and
suddenly
between
her
and
himself
he
saw
distinctly
the
face
he
had
seen
that
will
you
want
money
thank
you
i
have
very
well
let
us
know
when
you
are
coming
annette
put
down
the
cake
she
was
fingering
and
looking
up
through
darkened
lashes
said
shall
i
give
maman
any
message
my
annette
stretched
herself
her
hands
on
her
waist
and
said
in
french
what
luck
that
you
have
never
loved
me
soames
then
rising
she
too
left
the
room
soames
was
glad
she
had
spoken
it
in
seemed
to
require
no
dealing
with
again
that
other
beautiful
still
and
there
stirred
far
down
within
him
the
ghost
of
warmth
as
from
sparks
lingering
beneath
a
mound
of
flaky
ash
and
fleur
infatuated
with
her
boy
queer
chance
yet
was
there
such
a
thing
as
chance
a
man
went
down
a
street
a
brick
fell
on
his
head
ah
that
was
chance
no
doubt
but
this
inherited
his
girl
had
said
was
holding
on
part
iii
jolyon
walks
twofold
impulse
had
made
jolyon
say
to
his
wife
at
breakfast
let
go
up
to
lord
wanted
to
abate
the
anxiety
in
which
those
two
had
lived
during
the
sixty
hours
since
jon
had
brought
fleur
down
wanted
that
which
might
assuage
the
pangs
of
memory
in
one
who
knew
he
might
lose
them
any
day
years
ago
jolyon
had
become
an
eton
boy
for
old
whim
had
been
that
he
should
be
canonised
at
the
greatest
possible
expense
year
after
year
he
had
gone
to
lord
from
stanhope
gate
with
a
father
whose
youth
in
the
had
been
passed
without
polish
in
the
game
of
cricket
old
jolyon
would
speak
quite
openly
of
swipes
full
tosses
half
and
balls
and
young
jolyon
with
the
guileless
snobbery
of
youth
had
trembled
lest
his
sire
should
be
overheard
only
in
this
supreme
matter
of
cricket
he
had
been
nervous
for
his
crimean
whiskers
ever
impressed
him
as
the
beau
ideal
though
never
canonised
himself
old
jolyon
natural
fastidiousness
and
balance
had
saved
him
from
the
errors
of
the
vulgar
how
delicious
after
bowling
in
a
top
hat
and
a
sweltering
heat
to
go
home
with
his
father
in
a
hansom
cab
bathe
dress
and
forth
to
the
disunion
club
to
dine
off
white
bait
cutlets
and
a
tart
and
swells
old
and
young
in
lavender
kid
the
opera
or
play
and
on
sunday
when
the
match
was
over
and
his
top
hat
duly
broken
down
with
his
father
in
a
special
hansom
to
the
crown
and
sceptre
and
the
terrace
above
the
golden
sixties
when
the
world
was
simple
dandies
glamorous
democracy
not
born
and
the
books
of
whyte
melville
coming
thick
and
fast
a
generation
later
with
his
own
boy
jolly
with
old
jolyon
whim
his
grandson
had
been
canonised
at
a
trifle
less
jolyon
had
experienced
the
heat
and
of
the
day
and
come
back
to
the
cool
and
the
strawberry
beds
of
robin
hill
and
billiards
after
dinner
his
boy
making
the
most
flukes
and
trying
to
seem
languid
and
those
two
days
each
year
he
and
his
son
had
been
alone
together
in
the
world
one
on
each
democracy
just
born
and
so
he
had
unearthed
a
grey
top
hat
borrowed
a
tiny
bit
of
ribbon
from
irene
and
gingerly
keeping
cool
by
car
and
train
and
taxi
had
reached
lord
ground
there
beside
her
in
a
frock
with
narrow
black
edges
he
had
watched
the
game
and
felt
the
old
thrill
stir
within
him
when
soames
passed
the
day
was
spoiled
irene
face
was
distorted
by
compression
of
the
lips
no
good
to
go
on
sitting
here
with
soames
or
perhaps
his
daughter
recurring
in
front
of
them
like
decimals
and
he
said
well
dear
if
you
had
go
that
evening
jolyon
felt
exhausted
not
wanting
her
to
see
him
thus
he
waited
till
she
had
begun
to
play
and
stole
off
to
the
little
study
he
opened
the
long
window
for
air
and
the
door
that
he
might
still
hear
her
music
drifting
in
and
settled
in
his
father
old
armchair
closed
his
eyes
with
his
head
against
the
worn
brown
leather
like
that
passage
of
the
cesar
franck
had
been
his
life
with
her
a
divine
third
movement
and
now
this
business
of
bad
business
drifted
to
the
edge
of
consciousness
he
hardly
knew
if
it
were
in
sleep
that
he
smelled
the
scent
of
a
cigar
and
seemed
to
see
his
father
in
the
blackness
before
his
closed
eyes
that
shape
formed
went
and
formed
again
as
if
in
the
very
chair
where
he
himself
was
sitting
he
saw
his
father
with
knees
crossed
glasses
balanced
between
thumb
and
finger
saw
the
big
white
moustaches
and
the
deep
eyes
looking
up
below
a
dome
of
forehead
and
seeming
to
search
his
own
seeming
to
speak
are
you
facing
it
jo
it
for
you
to
decide
only
a
woman
ah
how
well
he
knew
his
father
in
that
phrase
how
all
the
victorian
age
came
up
with
it
and
his
answer
no
i
funked
hurting
her
and
jon
and
myself
i
got
a
heart
i
funked
but
the
old
eyes
so
much
older
so
much
younger
than
his
own
kept
at
it
it
your
wife
your
son
your
past
tackle
it
my
boy
was
it
a
message
from
walking
spirit
or
but
the
instinct
of
his
sire
living
on
within
him
and
again
came
that
scent
of
cigar
the
old
saturated
leather
well
he
would
tackle
it
write
to
jon
and
put
the
whole
thing
down
in
black
and
white
and
suddenly
he
breathed
with
difficulty
with
a
sense
of
suffocation
as
if
his
heart
were
swollen
he
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
air
the
stars
were
very
bright
he
passed
along
the
terrace
round
the
corner
of
the
house
till
through
the
window
of
the
he
could
see
irene
at
the
piano
with
falling
on
her
powdery
hair
withdrawn
into
herself
she
seemed
her
dark
eyes
staring
straight
before
her
her
hands
idle
jolyon
saw
her
raise
those
hands
and
clasp
them
over
her
breast
jon
with
her
he
thought
jon
i
dying
out
of
natural
and
careful
not
to
be
seen
he
stole
back
next
day
after
a
bad
night
he
sat
down
to
his
task
he
wrote
with
difficulty
and
many
erasures
my
dearest
boy
you
are
old
enough
to
understand
how
very
difficult
it
is
for
elders
to
give
themselves
away
to
their
young
especially
your
mother
and
myself
though
i
shall
never
think
of
her
as
anything
but
hearts
are
altogether
set
on
him
to
whom
they
must
confess
i
can
not
say
we
are
conscious
of
having
sinned
in
real
life
very
seldom
are
i
most
persons
would
say
we
had
and
at
all
events
our
conduct
righteous
or
not
has
found
us
out
the
truth
is
my
dear
we
both
have
pasts
which
it
is
now
my
task
to
make
known
to
you
because
they
so
grievously
and
deeply
affect
your
future
many
very
many
years
ago
as
far
back
indeed
as
when
she
was
only
twenty
your
mother
had
the
great
and
lasting
misfortune
to
make
an
unhappy
not
with
me
jon
without
money
of
her
own
and
with
only
a
related
to
was
very
unhappy
in
her
home
life
it
was
fleur
father
that
she
married
my
cousin
soames
forsyte
he
had
pursued
her
very
tenaciously
and
to
do
him
justice
was
deeply
in
love
with
her
within
a
week
she
knew
the
fearful
mistake
she
had
made
it
was
not
his
fault
it
was
her
error
of
so
far
jolyon
had
kept
some
semblance
of
irony
but
now
his
subject
carried
him
away
jon
i
want
to
explain
to
you
if
i
it
very
it
is
that
an
unhappy
marriage
such
as
this
can
so
easily
come
about
you
will
of
course
say
she
did
really
love
him
how
could
she
ever
have
married
him
you
would
be
right
if
it
were
not
for
one
or
two
rather
terrible
considerations
from
this
initial
mistake
of
hers
all
the
subsequent
trouble
sorrow
and
tragedy
have
come
and
so
i
must
make
it
clear
to
you
if
i
can
you
see
jon
in
those
days
and
even
to
this
i
do
see
for
all
the
talk
of
enlightenment
how
it
can
well
be
girls
are
married
ignorant
of
the
sexual
side
of
life
even
if
they
know
what
it
means
they
have
not
experienced
it
that
the
crux
it
is
this
actual
lack
of
experience
whatever
verbal
knowledge
they
have
which
makes
all
the
difference
and
all
the
trouble
in
a
vast
number
of
your
mother
was
are
not
and
can
not
be
certain
whether
they
love
the
man
they
marry
or
not
they
do
not
know
until
after
that
act
of
union
which
makes
the
reality
of
marriage
now
in
many
perhaps
in
most
doubtful
cases
this
act
cements
and
strengthens
the
attachment
but
in
other
cases
and
your
was
one
it
is
a
revelation
of
mistake
a
destruction
of
such
attraction
as
there
was
there
is
nothing
more
tragic
in
a
woman
life
than
such
a
revelation
growing
daily
nightly
clearer
and
unthinking
people
are
apt
to
laugh
at
such
a
mistake
and
say
a
fuss
about
nothing
narrow
and
people
only
capable
of
judging
the
lives
of
others
by
their
own
are
apt
to
condemn
those
who
make
this
tragic
error
to
condemn
them
for
life
to
the
dungeons
they
have
made
for
themselves
you
know
the
expression
has
made
her
bed
she
must
lie
on
it
it
is
a
saying
quite
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
or
lady
in
the
best
sense
of
those
words
and
i
can
use
no
stronger
condemnation
i
have
not
been
what
is
called
a
moral
man
but
i
wish
to
use
no
words
to
you
my
dear
which
will
make
you
think
lightly
of
ties
or
contracts
into
which
you
enter
heaven
forbid
but
with
the
experience
of
a
life
behind
me
i
do
say
that
those
who
condemn
the
victims
of
these
tragic
mistakes
condemn
them
and
hold
out
no
hands
to
help
them
are
inhuman
or
rather
they
would
be
if
they
had
the
understanding
to
know
what
they
are
doing
but
they
have
let
them
go
they
are
as
much
anathema
to
me
as
i
no
doubt
am
to
them
i
have
had
to
say
all
this
because
i
am
going
to
put
you
into
a
position
to
judge
your
mother
and
you
are
very
young
without
experience
of
what
life
is
to
go
on
with
the
story
after
three
years
of
effort
to
subdue
her
was
going
to
say
her
loathing
and
it
not
too
strong
a
word
for
shrinking
soon
becomes
loathing
under
such
years
of
what
to
a
sensitive
nature
like
your
mother
jon
was
torment
she
met
a
young
man
who
fell
in
love
with
her
he
was
the
architect
of
this
very
house
that
we
live
in
now
he
was
building
it
for
her
and
fleur
father
to
live
in
a
new
prison
to
hold
her
in
place
of
the
one
she
inhabited
with
him
in
london
perhaps
that
fact
played
some
part
in
what
came
of
it
but
in
any
case
she
too
fell
in
love
with
him
i
know
it
not
necessary
to
explain
to
you
that
one
does
not
precisely
choose
with
whom
one
will
fall
in
love
it
comes
very
well
it
came
i
can
she
never
said
much
to
me
about
struggle
that
then
took
place
in
her
because
jon
she
was
brought
up
strictly
and
was
not
light
in
her
at
all
however
this
was
an
overwhelming
feeling
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
loved
in
deed
as
well
as
in
thought
then
came
a
fearful
tragedy
i
must
tell
you
of
it
because
if
i
do
you
will
never
understand
the
real
situation
that
you
have
now
to
face
the
man
whom
she
had
forsyte
the
father
of
fleur
one
night
at
the
height
of
her
passion
for
this
young
man
forcibly
reasserted
his
rights
over
her
the
next
day
she
met
her
lover
and
told
him
of
it
whether
he
committed
suicide
or
whether
he
was
accidentally
run
over
in
his
distraction
we
never
knew
but
so
it
was
think
of
your
mother
as
she
was
that
evening
when
she
heard
of
his
death
i
happened
to
see
her
your
grandfather
sent
me
to
help
her
if
i
could
i
only
just
saw
her
before
the
door
was
shut
against
me
by
her
husband
but
i
have
never
forgotten
her
face
i
can
see
it
now
i
was
not
in
love
with
her
then
not
for
twelve
years
after
but
i
have
never
forgotten
my
dear
is
not
easy
to
write
like
this
but
you
see
i
must
your
mother
is
wrapped
up
in
you
utterly
devotedly
i
do
wish
to
write
harshly
of
soames
forsyte
i
do
think
harshly
of
him
i
have
long
been
sorry
for
him
perhaps
i
was
sorry
even
then
as
the
world
judges
she
was
in
error
he
within
his
rights
he
loved
his
way
she
was
his
property
that
is
the
view
he
holds
of
human
feelings
and
it
not
his
was
he
born
to
me
it
is
a
view
that
has
always
been
was
i
born
knowing
you
as
i
do
i
feel
it
can
not
be
otherwise
than
abhorrent
to
you
let
me
go
on
with
the
story
your
mother
fled
from
his
house
that
night
for
twelve
years
she
lived
quietly
alone
without
companionship
of
any
sort
until
in
her
see
he
was
still
her
husband
for
he
did
not
attempt
to
divorce
her
and
she
of
course
had
no
right
to
divorce
conscious
it
seems
of
the
want
of
children
and
commenced
a
long
attempt
to
induce
her
to
go
back
to
him
and
give
him
a
child
i
was
her
trustee
then
under
your
grandfather
will
and
i
watched
this
going
on
while
watching
i
became
attached
to
her
devotedly
attached
his
pressure
increased
till
one
day
she
came
to
me
here
and
practically
put
herself
under
my
protection
her
husband
who
was
kept
informed
of
all
her
movements
attempted
to
force
us
apart
by
bringing
a
divorce
suit
or
possibly
he
really
meant
it
i
do
know
but
anyway
our
names
were
publicly
joined
that
decided
us
and
we
became
united
in
fact
she
was
divorced
married
me
and
you
were
born
we
have
lived
in
perfect
happiness
at
least
i
have
and
i
believe
your
mother
also
soames
soon
after
the
divorce
married
fleur
mother
and
she
was
born
that
is
the
story
jon
i
have
told
it
you
because
by
the
affection
which
we
see
you
have
formed
for
this
man
daughter
you
are
blindly
moving
toward
what
must
utterly
destroy
your
mother
happiness
if
not
your
own
i
do
wish
to
speak
of
myself
because
at
my
age
there
no
use
supposing
i
shall
cumber
the
ground
much
longer
besides
what
i
should
suffer
would
be
mainly
on
her
account
and
on
yours
but
what
i
want
you
to
realise
is
that
feelings
of
horror
and
aversion
such
as
those
can
never
be
buried
or
forgotten
they
are
alive
in
her
only
yesterday
at
lord
we
happened
to
see
soames
forsyte
her
face
if
you
had
seen
it
would
have
convinced
you
the
idea
that
you
should
marry
his
daughter
is
a
nightmare
to
her
jon
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
fleur
save
that
she
is
his
daughter
but
your
children
if
you
married
her
would
be
the
grandchildren
of
soames
as
much
as
of
your
mother
of
a
man
who
once
owned
your
mother
as
a
man
might
own
a
slave
think
what
that
would
mean
by
such
a
marriage
you
enter
the
camp
which
held
your
mother
prisoner
and
wherein
she
ate
her
heart
out
you
are
just
on
the
threshold
of
life
you
have
only
known
this
girl
two
months
and
however
deeply
you
think
you
love
her
i
appeal
to
you
to
break
it
off
at
once
do
give
your
mother
this
rankling
pain
and
humiliation
during
the
rest
of
her
life
young
though
she
will
always
seem
to
me
she
is
except
for
us
two
she
has
no
one
in
the
world
she
will
soon
have
only
you
pluck
up
your
spirit
jon
and
break
away
do
put
this
cloud
and
barrier
between
you
do
break
her
heart
bless
you
my
dear
boy
and
again
forgive
me
for
all
the
pain
this
letter
must
bring
tried
to
spare
it
you
but
no
good
ever
your
devoted
father
jolyon
having
finished
his
confession
jolyon
sat
with
a
thin
cheek
on
his
hand
there
were
things
in
it
which
hurt
him
so
much
when
he
thought
of
jon
reading
them
that
he
nearly
tore
the
letter
up
to
speak
of
such
things
at
all
to
a
own
speak
of
them
in
relation
to
his
own
wife
and
the
boy
own
mother
seemed
dreadful
to
the
reticence
of
his
forsyte
soul
and
yet
without
speaking
of
them
how
make
jon
understand
the
reality
the
deep
cleavage
the
ineffaceable
scar
without
them
how
justify
this
stiffing
of
the
boy
love
he
might
just
as
well
not
write
at
all
he
folded
the
confession
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
it
heaven
he
had
till
sunday
evening
to
think
it
over
for
even
if
posted
now
it
could
not
reach
jon
till
monday
he
felt
a
curious
relief
at
this
delay
and
at
the
fact
that
whether
sent
or
not
it
was
written
in
the
rose
garden
which
had
taken
the
place
of
the
old
fernery
he
could
see
irene
snipping
and
pruning
with
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
she
was
never
idle
it
seemed
to
him
and
he
envied
her
now
that
he
himself
was
idle
nearly
all
his
time
he
went
down
to
her
she
held
up
a
stained
glove
and
smiled
a
piece
of
lace
tied
under
her
chin
concealed
her
hair
and
her
oval
face
with
its
still
dark
brows
looked
very
young
the
are
awful
this
year
and
yet
it
cold
you
look
tired
jolyon
took
the
confession
from
his
pocket
i
been
writing
this
i
think
you
ought
to
see
it
to
jon
her
whole
face
had
changed
in
that
instant
becoming
almost
haggard
yes
the
murder
he
gave
it
to
her
and
walked
away
among
the
roses
presently
seeing
that
she
had
finished
reading
and
was
standing
quite
still
with
the
sheets
of
the
letter
against
her
skirt
he
came
back
to
her
well
it
wonderfully
put
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
put
better
thank
you
is
there
anything
you
would
like
left
out
she
shook
her
head
no
he
must
know
all
if
he
to
that
what
i
thought
hate
it
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
hated
it
more
than
him
sex
was
so
much
easier
to
mention
between
man
and
woman
than
between
man
and
man
and
she
had
always
been
more
natural
and
frank
not
deeply
secretive
like
his
forsyte
self
i
wonder
if
he
will
understand
even
now
jolyon
he
so
young
and
he
shrinks
from
the
he
gets
that
shrinking
from
my
father
he
was
as
fastidious
as
a
girl
in
all
such
matters
would
it
be
better
to
rewrite
the
whole
thing
and
just
say
you
hated
soames
irene
shook
her
head
hate
only
a
word
it
conveys
nothing
no
better
as
it
very
well
it
shall
go
she
raised
her
face
to
his
and
in
sight
of
the
big
house
many
creepered
windows
he
kissed
her
late
that
same
afternoon
jolyon
had
a
nap
in
the
old
armchair
face
down
on
his
knee
was
la
rotisserie
de
la
refine
pedauque
and
just
before
he
fell
asleep
he
had
been
thinking
a
people
shall
we
ever
really
like
the
french
will
they
ever
really
like
us
he
himself
had
always
liked
the
french
feeling
at
home
with
their
wit
their
taste
their
cooking
irene
and
he
had
paid
many
visits
to
france
before
the
war
when
jon
had
been
at
his
private
school
his
romance
with
her
had
begun
in
last
and
most
enduring
romance
but
the
englishman
could
like
them
who
could
not
see
them
in
some
sort
with
the
detached
aesthetic
eye
and
with
that
melancholy
conclusion
he
had
nodded
off
when
he
woke
he
saw
jon
standing
between
him
and
the
window
the
boy
had
evidently
come
in
from
the
garden
and
was
waiting
for
him
to
wake
jolyon
smiled
still
half
asleep
how
nice
the
chap
affectionate
straight
then
his
heart
gave
a
nasty
jump
and
a
quaking
sensation
overcame
him
jon
that
confession
he
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
why
jon
where
did
you
spring
from
jon
bent
over
and
kissed
his
forehead
only
then
he
noticed
the
look
on
the
boy
face
i
came
home
to
tell
you
something
with
all
his
might
jolyon
tried
to
get
the
better
of
the
jumping
gurgling
sensations
within
his
chest
well
sit
down
old
man
have
you
seen
your
mother
the
boy
flushed
look
gave
place
to
pallor
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
the
old
chair
as
in
old
days
jolyon
himself
used
to
sit
beside
his
own
father
installed
in
its
recesses
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
rupture
in
their
relations
he
had
been
wont
to
perch
he
now
reached
such
a
moment
with
his
own
son
all
his
life
he
had
hated
scenes
like
poison
avoided
rows
gone
on
his
own
way
quietly
and
let
others
go
on
theirs
but
the
very
end
of
things
he
had
a
scene
before
him
more
painful
than
any
he
had
avoided
he
drew
a
visor
down
over
his
emotion
and
waited
for
his
son
to
speak
father
said
jon
slowly
fleur
and
i
are
thought
jolyon
breathing
with
difficulty
i
know
that
you
and
mother
do
like
the
idea
fleur
says
that
mother
was
engaged
to
her
father
before
you
married
her
of
course
i
do
know
what
happened
but
it
must
be
ages
ago
i
devoted
to
her
dad
and
she
says
she
is
to
jolyon
uttered
a
queer
sound
half
laugh
half
groan
you
are
nineteen
jon
and
i
am
how
are
we
to
understand
each
other
in
a
matter
like
this
eh
you
love
mother
dad
you
must
know
what
we
feel
it
is
fair
to
us
to
let
old
things
spoil
our
happiness
is
it
brought
face
to
face
with
his
confession
jolyon
resolved
to
do
without
it
if
by
any
means
he
could
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
boy
arm
look
jon
i
might
put
you
off
with
talk
about
your
both
being
too
young
and
not
knowing
your
own
minds
and
all
that
but
you
listen
besides
it
does
meet
the
unfortunately
cures
itself
you
talk
lightly
about
things
like
that
knowing
you
say
what
happened
now
have
i
ever
given
you
reason
to
doubt
my
love
for
you
or
my
word
at
a
less
anxious
moment
he
might
have
been
amused
by
the
conflict
his
words
boy
eager
clasp
to
reassure
him
on
these
points
the
dread
on
his
face
of
what
that
reassurance
would
bring
forth
but
he
could
only
feel
grateful
for
the
squeeze
very
well
you
can
believe
what
i
tell
you
if
you
do
give
up
this
love
affair
you
will
make
mother
wretched
to
the
end
of
her
days
believe
me
my
dear
the
past
whatever
it
was
ca
be
jon
got
off
the
arm
of
the
chair
she
up
before
pretty
loving
i
ca
father
how
can
because
you
say
that
of
course
i
ca
jon
if
you
knew
the
story
you
would
give
this
up
without
hesitation
you
would
have
to
ca
you
believe
me
how
can
you
tell
what
i
should
think
father
i
love
her
better
than
anything
in
the
jolyon
face
twitched
and
he
said
with
painful
slowness
better
than
your
mother
jon
from
the
boy
face
and
his
clenched
fists
jolyon
realised
the
stress
and
struggle
he
was
going
through
i
do
know
he
burst
out
i
do
know
but
to
give
fleur
up
for
something
i
do
understand
for
something
that
i
believe
can
really
matter
half
so
much
will
make
me
make
you
feel
us
unjust
put
a
but
that
better
than
going
on
with
i
ca
fleur
loves
me
and
i
love
her
you
want
me
to
trust
you
why
do
you
trust
me
father
we
would
want
to
know
would
let
it
make
any
difference
it
only
make
us
both
love
you
and
mother
all
the
jolyon
put
his
hand
into
his
breast
pocket
but
brought
it
out
again
empty
and
sat
clucking
his
tongue
against
his
teeth
think
what
your
mother
been
to
you
jon
she
has
nothing
but
you
i
sha
last
much
why
not
it
is
fair
not
well
said
jolyon
rather
coldly
because
the
doctors
tell
me
i
sha
that
oh
dad
cried
jon
and
burst
into
tears
this
downbreak
of
his
son
whom
he
had
not
seen
cry
since
he
was
ten
moved
jolyon
terribly
he
recognised
to
the
full
how
fearfully
soft
the
boy
heart
was
how
much
he
would
suffer
in
this
business
and
in
life
generally
and
he
reached
out
his
hand
wishing
indeed
not
daring
to
get
up
dear
man
he
said
you
make
me
jon
smothered
down
his
paroxysm
and
stood
with
face
averted
very
still
now
thought
jolyon
can
i
say
to
move
him
by
the
way
do
speak
of
that
to
mother
he
said
she
has
enough
to
frighten
her
with
this
affair
of
yours
i
know
how
you
feel
but
jon
you
know
her
and
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
we
would
wish
to
spoil
your
happiness
lightly
why
my
dear
boy
we
do
care
for
anything
but
your
least
with
me
it
just
yours
and
mother
and
with
her
just
yours
it
all
the
future
for
you
both
that
at
jon
turned
his
face
was
deadly
pale
his
eyes
deep
in
his
head
seemed
to
burn
what
is
it
what
is
it
do
keep
me
like
this
jolyon
who
knew
that
he
was
beaten
thrust
his
hand
again
into
his
breast
pocket
and
sat
for
a
full
minute
breathing
with
difficulty
his
eyes
closed
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
had
a
good
long
pretty
bitter
is
the
worst
then
he
brought
his
hand
out
with
the
letter
and
said
with
a
sort
of
fatigue
well
jon
if
you
had
come
i
was
going
to
send
you
this
i
wanted
to
spare
wanted
to
spare
your
mother
and
myself
but
i
see
it
no
good
read
it
and
i
think
i
go
into
the
he
reached
forward
to
get
up
jon
who
had
taken
the
letter
said
quickly
no
i
go
and
was
gone
jolyon
sank
back
in
his
chair
a
chose
that
moment
to
come
buzzing
round
him
with
a
sort
of
fury
the
sound
was
homely
better
than
nothing
where
had
the
boy
gone
to
read
his
letter
the
wretched
wretched
story
a
cruel
to
those
two
himself
his
heart
thumped
and
pained
him
aching
end
a
good
time
a
fine
time
in
spite
of
all
regretted
that
you
had
ever
been
born
wore
you
down
yet
did
not
make
you
want
to
was
the
cunning
evil
mistake
to
have
a
heart
again
the
came
in
all
the
heat
and
hum
and
scent
of
even
the
of
ripe
fruits
dried
grasses
sappy
shrubs
and
the
vanilla
breath
of
cows
and
out
there
somewhere
in
the
fragrance
jon
would
be
reading
that
letter
turning
and
twisting
its
pages
in
his
trouble
his
bewilderment
and
his
heart
about
it
the
thought
made
jolyon
acutely
miserable
jon
was
such
a
chap
affectionate
to
his
bones
and
conscientious
was
so
unfair
so
damned
unfair
he
remembered
irene
saying
to
him
once
never
was
any
one
born
more
loving
and
lovable
than
poor
little
jon
his
world
gone
up
the
spout
all
of
a
summer
afternoon
youth
took
things
so
hard
and
stirred
tormented
by
that
vision
of
youth
taking
things
hard
jolyon
got
out
of
his
chair
and
went
to
the
window
the
boy
was
nowhere
visible
and
he
passed
out
if
one
could
take
any
help
to
him
must
he
traversed
the
shrubbery
glanced
into
the
walled
jon
nor
where
the
peaches
and
the
apricots
were
beginning
to
swell
and
colour
he
passed
the
cupressus
trees
dark
and
spiral
into
the
meadow
where
had
the
boy
got
to
had
he
rushed
down
to
the
old
jolyon
crossed
the
rows
of
hay
they
would
cock
it
on
monday
and
be
carrying
the
day
after
if
rain
held
off
often
they
had
crossed
this
field
in
hand
when
jon
was
a
little
chap
dash
it
the
golden
age
was
over
by
the
time
one
was
ten
he
came
to
the
pond
where
flies
and
gnats
were
dancing
over
a
bright
reedy
surface
and
on
into
the
coppice
it
was
cool
there
fragrant
of
larches
still
no
jon
he
called
no
answer
on
the
log
seat
he
sat
down
nervous
anxious
forgetting
his
own
physical
sensations
he
had
been
wrong
to
let
the
boy
get
away
with
that
letter
he
ought
to
have
kept
him
under
his
eye
from
the
start
greatly
troubled
he
got
up
to
retrace
his
steps
at
the
he
called
again
and
looked
into
the
dark
there
in
the
cool
and
the
scent
of
vanilla
and
ammonia
away
from
flies
the
three
alderneys
were
chewing
the
quiet
cud
just
milked
waiting
for
evening
to
be
turned
out
again
into
the
lower
field
one
turned
a
lazy
head
a
lustrous
eye
jolyon
could
see
the
slobber
on
its
grey
lower
lip
he
saw
everything
with
passionate
clearness
in
the
agitation
of
his
that
in
his
time
he
had
adored
and
tried
to
of
light
and
shade
and
colour
no
wonder
the
legend
put
christ
into
a
more
devotional
than
the
eyes
and
horns
of
a
chewing
cow
in
the
warm
dusk
he
called
again
no
answer
and
he
hurried
away
out
of
the
coppice
past
the
pond
up
the
hill
oddly
he
came
to
think
of
jon
had
taken
the
gruel
of
his
discovery
down
in
the
coppice
where
his
mother
and
bosinney
in
those
old
days
had
made
the
plunge
of
acknowledging
their
love
where
he
himself
on
the
log
seat
the
sunday
morning
he
came
back
from
paris
had
realised
to
the
full
that
irene
had
become
the
world
to
him
that
would
have
been
the
place
for
irony
to
tear
the
veil
from
before
the
eyes
of
boy
but
he
was
not
here
where
had
he
got
to
one
must
find
the
poor
chap
a
gleam
of
sun
had
come
sharpening
to
his
hurrying
senses
all
the
beauty
of
the
afternoon
of
the
tall
trees
and
lengthening
shadows
of
the
blue
and
the
white
clouds
the
scent
of
the
hay
and
the
cooing
of
the
pigeons
and
the
flower
shapes
standing
tall
he
came
to
the
rosery
and
the
beauty
of
the
roses
in
that
sudden
sunlight
seemed
to
him
unearthly
rose
you
spaniard
wonderful
three
words
there
she
had
stood
by
that
bush
of
dark
red
roses
had
stood
to
read
and
decide
that
jon
must
know
it
all
he
knew
all
now
had
she
chosen
wrong
he
bent
and
sniffed
a
rose
its
petals
brushed
his
nose
and
trembling
lips
nothing
so
soft
as
a
velvet
except
her
on
across
the
lawn
he
went
up
the
slope
to
the
its
top
alone
was
glistening
for
the
sudden
sun
was
away
over
the
house
the
lower
shade
was
thick
blessedly
was
greatly
overheated
he
paused
a
minute
with
his
hand
on
the
rope
of
the
the
old
swing
and
suddenly
he
felt
over
done
it
he
thought
jove
i
overdone
all
he
staggered
up
toward
the
terrace
dragged
himself
up
the
steps
and
fell
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
leaned
there
gasping
his
face
buried
in
the
that
he
and
she
had
taken
such
trouble
with
that
it
might
sweeten
the
air
which
drifted
in
its
fragrance
mingled
with
awful
pain
love
he
thought
boy
and
with
a
great
effort
he
tottered
in
through
the
long
window
and
sank
into
old
jolyon
chair
the
book
was
there
a
pencil
in
it
he
caught
it
up
scribbled
a
word
on
the
open
page
his
hand
dropped
so
it
was
like
it
there
was
a
great
wrench
and
darkness
when
jon
rushed
away
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
ran
along
the
terrace
and
round
the
corner
of
the
house
in
fear
and
confusion
leaning
against
the
creepered
wall
he
tore
open
the
letter
it
was
long
this
added
to
his
fear
and
he
began
reading
when
he
came
to
the
words
it
was
fleur
father
that
she
married
everything
seemed
to
spin
before
him
he
was
close
to
a
window
and
entering
by
it
he
passed
through
and
hall
up
to
his
bedroom
dipping
his
face
in
cold
water
he
sat
on
his
bed
and
went
on
reading
dropping
each
finished
page
on
the
bed
beside
him
his
father
writing
was
easy
to
knew
it
so
well
though
he
had
never
had
a
letter
from
him
one
quarter
so
long
he
read
with
a
dull
only
half
at
work
he
best
grasped
on
that
first
reading
the
pain
his
father
must
have
had
in
writing
such
a
letter
he
let
the
last
sheet
fall
and
in
a
sort
of
mental
moral
helplessness
began
to
read
the
first
again
it
all
seemed
to
him
and
disgusting
then
suddenly
a
hot
wave
of
horrified
emotion
tingled
through
him
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
his
mother
fleur
father
he
took
up
the
letter
again
and
read
on
mechanically
and
again
came
the
feeling
that
it
was
all
dead
and
disgusting
his
own
love
so
different
this
letter
said
his
her
father
an
awful
letter
property
could
there
be
men
who
looked
on
women
as
their
property
faces
seen
in
street
and
countryside
came
thronging
up
before
faces
hard
dull
faces
prim
dry
faces
violent
faces
hundreds
thousands
of
them
how
could
he
know
what
men
who
had
such
faces
thought
and
did
he
held
his
head
in
his
hands
and
groaned
his
mother
he
caught
up
the
letter
and
read
on
again
horror
and
in
her
your
children
grandchildren
of
a
man
who
once
owned
your
mother
as
a
man
might
own
a
slave
he
got
up
from
his
bed
this
cruel
shadowy
past
lurking
there
to
murder
his
love
and
fleur
was
true
or
his
father
could
never
have
written
it
did
they
tell
me
the
first
thing
he
thought
day
i
first
saw
fleur
they
knew
i
seen
her
they
were
afraid
it
overcome
by
misery
too
acute
for
thought
or
reason
he
crept
into
a
dusky
corner
of
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
he
sat
there
like
some
unhappy
little
animal
there
was
comfort
in
dusk
and
the
if
he
were
back
in
those
days
when
he
played
his
battles
sprawling
all
over
it
he
sat
there
huddled
his
hair
ruffled
his
hands
clasped
round
his
knees
for
how
long
he
did
not
know
he
was
wrenched
from
his
blank
wretchedness
by
the
sound
of
the
door
opening
from
his
mother
room
the
blinds
were
down
over
the
windows
of
his
room
shut
up
in
his
absence
and
from
where
he
sat
he
could
only
hear
a
rustle
her
footsteps
crossing
till
beyond
the
bed
he
saw
her
standing
before
his
she
had
something
in
her
hand
he
hardly
breathed
hoping
she
would
not
see
him
and
go
away
he
saw
her
touch
things
on
the
table
as
if
they
had
some
virtue
in
them
then
face
the
from
head
to
foot
like
a
ghost
the
least
turn
of
her
head
and
she
must
see
him
her
lips
moved
oh
jon
she
was
speaking
to
herself
the
tone
of
her
voice
troubled
jon
heart
he
saw
in
her
hand
a
little
photograph
she
held
it
toward
the
light
looking
at
small
he
knew
of
himself
as
a
tiny
boy
which
she
always
kept
in
her
bag
his
heart
beat
fast
and
suddenly
as
if
she
had
heard
it
she
turned
her
eyes
and
saw
him
at
the
gasp
she
gave
and
the
movement
of
her
hands
pressing
the
photograph
against
her
breast
he
said
yes
it
she
moved
over
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
on
it
quite
close
to
him
her
hands
still
clasping
her
breast
her
feet
among
the
sheets
of
the
letter
which
had
slipped
to
the
floor
she
saw
them
and
her
hands
grasped
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
sat
very
upright
her
dark
eyes
fixed
on
him
at
last
she
spoke
well
jon
you
know
i
you
seen
father
there
was
a
long
silence
till
she
said
oh
my
darling
it
all
the
emotions
in
him
were
so
violent
and
so
mixed
that
he
dared
not
despair
and
yet
a
strange
yearning
for
the
comfort
of
her
hand
on
his
forehead
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
do
there
was
another
long
silence
then
she
got
up
she
stood
a
moment
very
still
made
a
little
movement
with
her
hand
and
said
my
darling
boy
my
most
darling
boy
do
think
of
of
yourself
and
passing
round
the
foot
of
the
bed
went
back
into
her
room
jon
into
a
sort
of
ball
as
might
a
the
corner
made
by
the
two
walls
he
must
have
been
twenty
minutes
there
before
a
cry
roused
him
it
came
from
the
terrace
below
he
got
up
scared
again
came
the
cry
jon
his
mother
was
calling
he
ran
out
and
down
the
stairs
through
the
empty
into
the
study
she
was
kneeling
before
the
old
armchair
and
his
father
was
lying
back
quite
white
his
head
on
his
breast
one
of
his
hands
resting
on
an
open
book
with
a
pencil
clutched
in
strangely
still
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
she
looked
round
wildly
and
said
oh
dead
jon
flung
himself
down
and
reaching
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
where
he
had
lately
been
sitting
put
his
lips
to
the
forehead
icy
cold
how
could
dad
be
dead
when
only
an
hour
his
mother
arms
were
round
the
knees
pressing
her
breast
against
them
i
with
him
he
heard
her
whisper
then
he
saw
the
tottering
word
irene
pencilled
on
the
open
page
and
broke
down
himself
it
was
his
first
sight
of
human
death
and
its
unutterable
stillness
blotted
from
him
all
other
emotion
all
else
then
was
but
preliminary
to
this
all
love
and
life
and
joy
anxiety
and
sorrow
all
movement
light
and
beauty
but
a
beginning
to
this
terrible
white
stillness
it
made
a
dreadful
mark
on
him
all
seemed
suddenly
little
futile
short
he
mastered
himself
at
last
got
up
and
raised
her
mother
do
some
hours
later
when
all
was
done
that
had
to
be
and
his
mother
was
lying
down
he
saw
his
father
alone
on
the
bed
covered
with
a
white
sheet
he
stood
for
a
long
time
gazing
at
that
face
which
had
never
looked
whimsical
and
kind
to
be
kind
and
keep
your
end
nothing
else
in
it
he
had
once
heard
his
father
say
how
wonderfully
dad
had
acted
up
to
that
philosophy
he
understood
now
that
his
father
had
known
for
a
long
time
past
that
this
would
come
and
not
said
a
word
he
gazed
with
an
awed
and
passionate
reverence
the
loneliness
of
to
spare
his
mother
and
himself
his
own
trouble
seemed
small
while
he
was
looking
at
that
face
the
word
scribbled
on
the
page
the
farewell
word
now
his
mother
had
no
one
but
himself
he
went
up
close
to
the
dead
changed
at
all
and
yet
completely
changed
he
had
heard
his
father
say
once
that
he
did
not
believe
in
consciousness
surviving
death
or
that
if
it
did
it
might
be
just
survival
till
the
natural
age
limit
of
the
body
had
been
natural
term
of
its
inherent
vitality
so
that
if
the
body
were
broken
by
accident
excess
violent
disease
consciousness
might
still
persist
till
in
the
course
of
nature
uninterfered
with
it
would
naturally
have
faded
out
it
had
struck
him
because
he
had
never
heard
any
one
else
suggest
it
when
the
heart
failed
like
it
was
not
quite
natural
perhaps
his
father
consciousness
was
in
the
room
with
him
above
the
bed
hung
a
picture
of
his
father
father
perhaps
his
consciousness
too
was
still
alive
and
his
who
had
died
in
the
transvaal
were
they
all
gathered
round
this
bed
jon
kissed
the
forehead
and
stole
back
to
his
own
room
the
door
between
it
and
his
mother
was
ajar
she
had
evidently
been
was
ready
for
him
even
some
biscuits
and
hot
milk
and
the
letter
no
longer
on
the
floor
he
ate
and
drank
watching
the
last
light
fade
he
did
not
try
to
see
into
the
stared
at
the
dark
branches
of
the
level
with
his
window
and
felt
as
if
life
had
stopped
once
in
the
night
turning
in
his
heavy
sleep
he
was
conscious
of
something
white
and
still
beside
his
bed
and
started
up
his
mother
voice
said
it
only
i
jon
dear
her
hand
pressed
his
forehead
gently
back
her
white
figure
disappeared
alone
he
fell
heavily
asleep
again
and
dreamed
he
saw
his
name
crawling
on
his
bed
cogitates
the
announcement
in
the
times
of
his
cousin
jolyon
death
affected
soames
quite
simply
so
that
chap
was
gone
there
had
never
been
a
time
in
their
two
lives
when
love
had
not
been
lost
between
them
that
sentiment
hatred
had
run
its
course
long
since
in
heart
and
he
had
refused
to
allow
any
recrudescence
but
he
considered
this
early
decease
a
piece
of
poetic
justice
for
twenty
years
the
fellow
had
enjoyed
the
reversion
of
his
wife
and
house
was
dead
the
obituary
notice
which
appeared
a
little
later
paid
much
attention
it
spoke
of
that
diligent
and
agreeable
painter
whose
work
we
have
come
to
look
on
as
typical
of
the
best
soames
who
had
almost
mechanically
preferred
mole
morpin
and
caswell
baye
and
had
always
sniffed
quite
audibly
when
he
came
to
one
of
his
cousin
on
the
line
turned
the
times
with
a
crackle
he
had
to
go
up
to
town
that
morning
on
forsyte
affairs
and
was
fully
conscious
of
gradman
glance
sidelong
over
his
spectacles
the
old
clerk
had
about
him
an
aura
of
regretful
congratulation
he
smelled
as
it
were
of
old
days
one
could
almost
hear
him
thinking
mr
jolyon
my
age
and
dear
i
dare
say
she
feels
it
she
was
a
woman
flesh
is
flesh
they
given
a
notice
in
the
papers
fancy
his
atmosphere
in
fact
caused
soames
to
handle
certain
leases
and
conversions
with
exceptional
swiftness
about
that
settlement
on
miss
fleur
soames
i
thought
better
of
that
answered
soames
shortly
ah
i
glad
of
that
i
thought
you
were
a
little
hasty
the
times
do
how
this
death
would
affect
fleur
had
begun
to
trouble
soames
he
was
not
certain
that
she
knew
of
seldom
looked
at
the
paper
never
at
the
births
marriages
and
deaths
he
pressed
matters
on
and
made
his
way
to
green
street
for
lunch
winifred
was
almost
doleful
jack
cardigan
had
broken
a
splashboard
so
far
as
one
could
make
out
and
would
not
be
fit
for
some
time
she
could
not
get
used
to
the
idea
did
profond
ever
get
off
he
said
suddenly
he
got
off
replied
winifred
but
do
yes
there
it
to
tell
anything
not
that
he
wanted
to
know
letters
from
annette

coming
from
dieppe
where
she
and
her
mother
were
staying
you
saw
that
fellow
death
i
suppose
yes
said
winifred
i
sorry
his
children
he
was
very
soames
uttered
a
rather
queer
sound
a
suspicion
of
the
old
deep
men
were
judged
in
this
world
rather
by
what
they
were
than
by
what
they
and
knocked
resentfully
at
the
back
doors
of
his
mind
i
know
there
was
a
superstition
to
that
effect
he
muttered
one
must
do
him
justice
now
he
i
should
like
to
have
done
him
justice
before
said
soames
but
i
never
had
the
chance
have
you
got
a

uncle
alive
i
monty

at
his
club
he
brought
him
here
to
dinner
once
monty
was
always
thinking
of
writing
a
book
you
know
about
how
to
make
money
on
the
turf
he
tried
to
interest
that
well
he
put
him
on
to
a
the
two
thousand
we
did
see
him
again
he
was
rather
smart
if

did
it

monty

quite
clever
in
his
was
he
said

connection

sucking
baronet
and
publishing
people
do
all
sorts
of
things
nowadays
replied
winifred
the
great
stunt
seems
not
to
be
different
from
our
time
to
do
nothing
was
the
thing
then
but
i
suppose
it
come
this
young
mont
that
i
speaking
of
is
very
sweet
on
fleur
if
it
would
put
an
end
to
that
other
affair
i
might
encourage
has
he
got
style
asked
winifred
he
no
beauty
pleasant
enough
with
some
scattered
brains
there
a
good
deal
of
land

believe
he
seems
genuinely
attached
but
i
no
murmured
winifred
difficult
i
always
found
it
best
to
do
nothing
it
is
such
a
bore
about
jack

the
way
of
holidays
and
strikes
when
you
the
country
bores
me
answered
winifred
and
i
found
the
railway
strike
quite
winifred
had
always
been
noted
for
soames
took
his
leave
all
the
way
down
to
reading
he
debated
whether
he
should
tell
fleur
of
that
boy
father
death
it
did
not
alter
the
situation
except
that
he
would
be
independent
now
and
only
have
his
mother
opposition
to
encounter
he
would
come
into
a
lot
of
money
no
doubt
and
perhaps
the
house
built
for
irene
and
house
whose
architect
had
wrought
his
domestic
ruin
his
of
that
house
that
would
be
poetic
justice
soames
uttered
a
little
mirthless
laugh
he
had
designed
that
house
to
his
failing
union
meant
it
for
the
seat
of
his
descendants
if
he
could
have
induced
irene
to
give
him
one
her
son
and
fleur
their
children
would
be
in
some
sort
offspring
of
the
union
between
himself
and
her
the
theatricality
in
that
thought
was
repulsive
to
his
sober
sense
and
would
be
the
easiest
and
wealthiest
way
out
of
the
impasse
now
that
jolyon
was
gone
the
juncture
of
two
forsyte
fortunes
had
a
kind
of
conservative
charm
and
be
linked
to
him
once
more
nonsense
absurd
he
put
the
notion
from
his
head
on
arriving
home
he
heard
the
click
of
and
through
the
window
saw
young
mont
sprawling
over
the
table
fleur
with
her
cue
akimbo
was
watching
with
a
smile
how
pretty
she
looked
no
wonder
that
young
fellow
was
out
of
his
mind
about
her
a
there
was
little
enough
in
land
these
days
perhaps
less
in
a
title
the
old
forsytes
had
always
had
a
kind
of
contempt
for
titles
rather
remote
and
artificial
worth
the
money
they
cost
and
having
to
do
with
the
court
they
had
all
had
that
feeling
in
differing
remembered
swithin
indeed
in
his
most
expansive
days
had
once
attended
a
levee
he
had
come
away
saying
he
should
go
all
that
small
it
was
suspected
that
he
had
looked
too
big
in
soames
remembered
how
his
own
mother
had
wished
to
be
presented
because
of
the
fashionable
nature
of
the
performance
and
how
his
father
had
put
his
foot
down
with
unwonted
decision
what
did
she
want
with
that
time
and
money
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
instinct
which
had
made
and
kept
the
english
commons
the
chief
power
in
the
state
a
feeling
that
their
own
world
was
good
enough
and
a
little
better
than
any
other
because
it
was
their
world
had
kept
the
old
forsytes
singularly
free
of
flummery
as
nicholas
had
been
wont
to
call
it
when
he
had
the
gout
soames
generation
more
and
ironical
had
been
saved
by
a
sense
of
swithin
in
while
the
third
and
the
fourth
generation
as
it
seemed
to
him
laughed
at
everything
however
there
was
no
harm
in
the
young
fellow
being
heir
to
a
title
and
thing
one
could
help
he
entered
quietly
as
mont
missed
his
shot
he
noted
the
young
man
eyes
fixed
on
fleur
bending
over
in
her
turn
and
the
adoration
in
them
almost
touched
him
she
paused
with
the
cue
poised
on
the
bridge
of
her
slim
hand
and
shook
her
crop
of
short
dark
chestnut
hair
i
shall
never
do
venture
all
the
cue
struck
the
ball
rolled
there
bad
luck
never
mind
then
they
saw
him
and
soames
said
i
mark
for
he
sat
down
on
the
raised
seat
beneath
the
marker
trim
and
tired
furtively
studying
those
two
young
faces
when
the
game
was
over
mont
came
up
to
him
i
started
in
sir
rum
game
business
is
it
i
suppose
you
saw
a
lot
of
human
nature
as
a
i
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
noticed
people
are
quite
on
the
wrong
tack
in
offering
less
than
they
can
afford
to
give
they
ought
to
offer
more
and
work
soames
raised
his
eyebrows
suppose
the
more
is
accepted
that
does
matter
a
little
bit
said
mont
it
much
more
paying
to
abate
a
price
than
to
increase
it
for
instance
say
we
offer
an
author
good
naturally
takes
them
then
we
go
into
it
find
we
publish
at
a
decent
profit
and
tell
him
so
he
got
confidence
in
us
because
we
been
generous
to
him
and
he
comes
down
like
a
lamb
and
bears
us
no
malice
but
if
we
offer
him
poor
terms
at
the
start
he
does
take
them
so
we
have
to
advance
them
to
get
him
and
he
thinks
us
damned
screws
into
the
bargain
try
buying
pictures
on
that
system
said
soames
an
offer
accepted
is
a
you
learned
that
young
mont
turned
his
head
to
where
fleur
was
standing
in
the
window
no
he
said
i
wish
i
had
then
there
another
thing
always
let
a
man
off
a
bargain
if
he
wants
to
be
let
as
advertisement
said
soames
dryly
of
course
it
is
but
i
meant
on
does
your
firm
work
on
those
lines
not
yet
said
mont
but
it
and
they
will
no
really
sir
i
making
any
number
of
observations
and
they
all
confirm
my
theory
human
nature
is
consistently
underrated
in
business
people
do
themselves
out
of
an
awful
lot
of
pleasure
and
profit
by
that
of
course
you
must
be
perfectly
genuine
and
open
but
that
easy
if
you
feel
it
the
more
human
and
generous
you
are
the
better
chance
you
got
in
soames
rose
are
you
a
partner
not
for
six
months
the
rest
of
the
firm
had
better
make
haste
and
mont
laughed
you
see
he
said
there
going
to
be
a
big
change
the
possessive
principle
has
got
its
shutters
what
said
soames
the
house
is
to
let
sir
i
off
soames
watched
his
daughter
give
her
hand
saw
her
wince
at
the
squeeze
it
received
and
distinctly
heard
the
young
man
sigh
as
he
passed
out
then
she
came
from
the
window
trailing
her
finger
along
the
mahogany
edge
of
the
watching
her
soames
knew
that
she
was
going
to
ask
him
something
her
finger
felt
round
the
last
pocket
and
she
looked
up
have
you
done
anything
to
stop
jon
writing
to
me
father
soames
shook
his
head
you
have
seen
then
he
said
his
father
died
just
a
week
ago
oh
in
her
startled
frowning
face
he
saw
the
instant
struggle
to
apprehend
what
this
would
mean
poor
jon
why
did
you
tell
me
father
i
never
know
said
soames
slowly
you
do
confide
in
i
would
if
you
help
me
perhaps
i
fleur
clasped
her
hands
oh
one
wants
a
thing
fearfully
one
does
think
of
other
people
do
be
angry
with
soames
put
out
his
hand
as
if
pushing
away
an
aspersion
i
cogitating
he
said
what
on
earth
had
made
him
use
a
word
like
that
has
young
mont
been
bothering
you
again
fleur
smiled
oh
michael
he
always
bothering
but
he
such
a
good
do
mind
well
said
soames
i
tired
i
shall
go
and
have
a
nap
before
he
went
up
to
his
lay
down
on
the
couch
there
and
closed
his
eyes
a
terrible
responsibility
this
girl
of
mother
what
was
she
a
terrible
responsibility
help
could
he
help
her
he
could
not
alter
the
fact
that
he
was
her
father
or
that
what
was
it
young
mont
had
nonsense
about
the
possessive
let
silly
the
sultry
air
charged
with
a
scent
of
of
river
and
roses
closed
on
his
senses
drowsing
them
fixed
idea
the
fixed
idea
which
has
outrun
more
constables
than
any
other
form
of
human
disorder
has
never
more
speed
and
stamina
than
when
it
takes
the
avid
guise
of
love
to
hedges
and
ditches
and
doors
to
humans
without
ideas
fixed
or
otherwise
to
perambulators
and
the
contents
sucking
their
fixed
ideas
even
to
the
other
sufferers
from
this
fast
fixed
idea
of
love
pays
no
attention
it
runs
with
eyes
turned
inward
to
its
own
light
oblivious
of
all
other
stars
those
with
the
fixed
ideas
that
human
happiness
depends
on
their
art
on
vivisecting
dogs
on
hating
foreigners
on
paying
supertax
on
remaining
ministers
on
making
wheels
go
round
on
preventing
their
neighbours
from
being
divorced
on
conscientious
objection
greek
roots
church

and
superiority
to
everybody

with
other
forms
of
are
unstable
compared
with
him
or
her
whose
fixed
idea
is
the
possession
of
some
her
or
him
and
though
fleur
those
chilly
summer
days
pursued
the
scattered
life
of
a
little
forsyte
whose
frocks
are
paid
for
and
whose
business
is
pleasure
she
winifred
would
have
said
in
the
latest
fashion
of
honest
to
god
indifferent
to
it
all
she
wished
and
wished
for
the
moon
which
sailed
in
cold
skies
above
the
river
or
the
green
park
when
she
went
to
town
she
even
kept
jon
letters
covered
with
pink
silk
on
her
heart
than
which
in
days
when
corsets
were
so
low
sentiment
so
despised
and
chests
so
out
of
fashion
there
could
perhaps
have
been
no
greater
proof
of
the
fixity
of
her
idea
after
hearing
of
his
father
death
she
wrote
to
jon
and
received
his
answer
three
days
later
on
her
return
from
a
river
picnic
it
was
his
first
letter
since
their
meeting
at
june
she
opened
it
with
misgiving
and
read
it
with
dismay
since
i
saw
you
i
heard
everything
about
the
past
i
wo
tell
it
think
you
knew
when
we
met
at
june
she
says
you
did
if
you
did
fleur
you
ought
to
have
told
me
i
expect
you
only
heard
your
father
side
of
it
i
have
heard
my
mother
it
dreadful
now
that
she
so
sad
i
ca
do
anything
to
hurt
her
more
of
course
i
long
for
you
all
day
but
i
do
believe
now
that
we
shall
ever
come
something
too
strong
pulling
us
so
her
deception
had
found
her
out
but
forgiven
that
it
was
what
he
said
of
his
mother
which
caused
the
guttering
in
her
heart
and
the
weak
sensation
in
her
legs
her
first
impulse
was
to
second
not
to
reply
these
impulses
were
constantly
renewed
in
the
days
which
followed
while
desperation
grew
within
her
she
was
not
her
father
child
for
nothing
the
tenacity
which
had
at
once
made
and
undone
soames
was
her
backbone
too
frilled
and
embroidered
by
french
grace
and
quickness
instinctively
she
conjugated
the
verb
to
have
always
with
the
pronoun
she
concealed
however
all
signs
of
her
growing
desperation
and
pursued
such
river
pleasures
as
the
winds
and
rain
of
a
disagreeable
july
permitted
as
if
she
had
no
care
in
the
world
nor
did
any
sucking
baronet
ever
neglect
the
business
of
a
publisher
more
consistently
than
her
attendant
spirit
michael
mont
to
soames
she
was
a
puzzle
he
was
almost
deceived
by
this
careless
gaiety
he
did
not
fail
to
mark
her
eyes
often
fixed
on
nothing
and
the
film
of
light
shining
from
her
bedroom
window
late
at
night
what
was
she
thinking
and
brooding
over
into
small
hours
when
she
ought
to
have
been
asleep
but
he
dared
not
ask
what
was
in
her
mind
and
since
that
one
little
talk
in
the
she
said
nothing
to
him
in
this
taciturn
condition
of
affairs
it
chanced
that
winifred
invited
them
to
lunch
and
to
go
afterward
to
a
most
amusing
little
play
beggar
opera
and
would
they
bring
a
man
to
make
four
soames
whose
attitude
toward
theatres
was
to
go
to
nothing
accepted
because
attitude
was
to
go
to
everything
they
motored
up
taking
michael
mont
who
being
in
his
seventh
heaven
was
found
by
winifred
very
the
beggar
opera
puzzled
soames
the
people
were
very
unpleasant
the
whole
thing
very
cynical
winifred
was
intrigued
the
dresses
the
music
too
did
not
displease
her
at
the
opera
the
night
before
she
had
arrived
too
early
for
the
russian
ballet
and
found
the
stage
occupied
by
singers
for
a
whole
hour
pale
or
apoplectic
from
terror
lest
by
some
dreadful
inadvertence
they
might
drop
into
a
tune
michael
mont
was
enraptured
with
the
whole
thing
and
all
three
wondered
what
fleur
was
thinking
of
it
but
fleur
was
not
thinking
of
it
her
fixed
idea
stood
on
the
stage
and
sang
with
polly
peachum
mimed
with
filch
danced
with
jenny
diver
postured
with
lucy
lockit
kissed
trolled
and
cuddled
with
macheath
her
lips
might
smile
her
hands
applaud
but
the
comic
old
masterpiece
made
no
more
impression
on
her
than
if
it
had
been
pathetic
like
a
modern
when
they
embarked
in
the
car
to
return
she
ached
because
jon
was
not
sitting
next
her
instead
of
michael
mont
when
at
some
jolt
the
young
man
arm
touched
hers
as
if
by
accident
she
only
thought
that
were
jon
arm
when
his
cheerful
voice
tempered
by
her
proximity
murmured
above
the
sound
of
the
car
progress
she
smiled
and
answered
thinking
that
were
jon
voice
and
when
once
he
said
fleur
you
look
a
perfect
angel
in
that
dress
she
answered
oh
do
you
like
it
thinking
only
jon
could
see
it
during
this
drive
she
took
a
resolution
she
would
go
to
robin
hill
and
see
she
would
take
the
car
without
word
beforehand
to
him
or
to
her
father
it
was
nine
days
since
his
letter
and
she
could
wait
no
longer
on
monday
she
would
go
the
decision
made
her
well
disposed
toward
young
mont
with
something
to
look
forward
to
she
could
afford
to
tolerate
and
respond
he
might
stay
to
dinner
propose
to
her
as
usual
dance
with
her
press
her
hand
what
he
liked
he
was
only
a
nuisance
when
he
interfered
with
her
fixed
idea
she
was
even
sorry
for
him
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
be
sorry
for
anybody
but
herself
just
now
at
dinner
he
seemed
to
talk
more
wildly
than
usual
about
what
he
called
the
death
of
the
close
borough
paid
little
attention
but
her
father
seemed
paying
a
good
deal
with
the
smile
on
his
face
which
meant
opposition
if
not
anger
the
younger
generation
does
think
as
you
do
sir
does
it
fleur

shrugged
her
younger
generation

did
not
know

thinking

people

think
as
i
do
when

nature

i
admit
that
sir
but
the
forms
of

change
with

a

of
thought
that
going
indeed

mind

business

not
a
form
of

it
an
yes

what
is
one

the
point
everybody

it
fleur

only
smiled
if
not
added
young
mont
there
be
people

talked
like
that
from
time
immemorial
but
you
admit
sir
that
the
sense
of

is
dying

increasing

his
widow
in
possession
of
robin
hill
with
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
for
life
apart
from
this
the
two
wills
worked
together
in
some
complicated
way
to
insure
that
each
of
jolyon
three
children
should
have
an
equal
share
in
their
grandfather
and
father
property
in
the
future
as
in
the
present
save
only
that
jon
by
virtue
of
his
sex
would
have
control
of
his
capital
when
he
was
while
june
and
holly
would
only
have
the
spirit
of
theirs
in
order
that
their
children
might
have
the
body
after
them
if
they
had
no
children
it
would
all
come
to
jon
if
he
outlived
them
and
since
june
was
fifty
and
holly
nearly
forty
it
was
considered
in
lincoln
inn
fields
that
but
for
the
cruelty
of
income
tax
young
jon
would
be
as
warm
a
man
as
his
grandfather
when
he
died
all
this
was
nothing
to
jon
and
little
enough
to
his
mother
it
was
june
who
did
everything
needful
for
one
who
had
left
his
affairs
in
perfect
order
when
she
had
gone
and
those
two
were
alone
again
in
the
great
house
alone
with
death
drawing
them
together
and
love
driving
them
apart
jon
passed
very
painful
days
secretly
disgusted
and
disappointed
with
himself
his
mother
would
look
at
him
with
such
a
patient
sadness
which
yet
had
in
it
an
instinctive
pride
as
if
she
were
reserving
her
defence
if
she
smiled
he
was
angry
that
his
answering
smile
should
be
so
grudging
and
unnatural
he
did
not
judge
or
condemn
her
that
was
all
too
the
idea
of
doing
so
had
never
come
to
him
no
he
was
grudging
and
unnatural
because
he
could
have
what
he
wanted
because
of
her
there
was
one
to
do
in
connection
with
his
father
career
which
could
not
be
safely
entrusted
to
june
though
she
had
offered
to
undertake
it
both
jon
and
his
mother
had
felt
that
if
she
took
his
portfolios
unexhibited
drawings
and
unfinished
matter
away
with
her
the
work
would
encounter
such
icy
blasts
from
paul
post
and
other
frequenters
of
her
studio
that
it
would
soon
be
frozen
out
even
of
her
warm
heart
on
its
plane
and
of
its
kind
the
work
was
good
and
they
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
its
subjection
to
ridicule
a
exhibition
of
his
work
was
the
least
testimony
they
could
pay
to
one
they
had
loved
and
on
preparation
for
this
they
spent
many
hours
together
jon
came
to
have
a
curiously
increased
respect
for
his
father
the
quiet
tenacity
with
which
he
had
converted
a
mediocre
talent
into
something
really
individual
was
disclosed
by
these
researches
there
was
a
great
mass
of
work
with
a
rare
continuity
of
growth
in
depth
and
reach
of
vision
nothing
certainly
went
very
deep
or
reached
very
such
as
the
work
was
it
was
thorough
conscientious
and
complete
and
remembering
his
father
utter
absence
of
side
or
the
chaffing
humility
with
which
he
had
always
spoken
of
his
own
efforts
ever
calling
himself
an
amateur
jon
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
had
never
really
known
his
father
to
take
himself
seriously
yet
never
that
he
did
so
seemed
to
have
been
his
ruling
principle
there
was
something
in
this
which
appealed
to
the
boy
and
made
him
heartily
endorse
his
mother
comment
he
had
true
refinement
he
could
help
thinking
of
others
whatever
he
did
and
when
he
took
a
resolution
which
went
counter
he
did
it
with
the
minimum
of
like
the
age
is
it
twice
in
his
life
he
had
to
go
against
everything
and
yet
it
never
made
him
jon
saw
tears
running
down
her
face
which
she
at
once
turned
away
from
him
she
was
so
quiet
about
her
loss
that
sometimes
he
had
thought
she
did
feel
it
much
now
as
he
looked
at
her
he
felt
how
far
he
fell
short
of
the
reserve
power
and
dignity
in
both
his
father
and
his
mother
and
stealing
up
to
her
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
kissed
him
swiftly
but
with
a
sort
of
passion
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
studio
where
they
had
been
sorting
and
labelling
had
once
been
holly
schoolroom
devoted
to
her
silkworms
dried
lavender
music
and
other
forms
of
instruction
now
at
the
end
of
july
despite
its
northern
and
eastern
aspects
a
warm
and
slumberous
air
came
in
between
the
lilac
linen
curtains
to
redeem
a
little
the
departed
glory
as
of
a
field
that
is
golden
and
gone
clinging
to
a
room
which
its
master
has
left
irene
had
placed
on
the
table
a
bowl
of
red
roses
this
and
jolyon
favourite
cat
who
still
clung
to
the
deserted
habitat
were
the
pleasant
spots
in
that
dishevelled
sad
workroom
jon
at
the
north
window
sniffing
air
mysteriously
scented
with
warm
strawberries
heard
a
car
drive
up
the
lawyers
again
about
some
nonsense
why
did
that
scent
so
make
one
ache
and
where
did
it
come
were
no
strawberry
beds
on
this
side
of
the
house
instinctively
he
took
a
crumpled
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
wrote
down
some
broken
words
a
warmth
began
spreading
in
his
chest
he
rubbed
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
presently
he
had
jotted
this
if
i
could
make
a
little
song
a
little
song
to
soothe
my
heart
make
it
all
of
little
things
the
plash
of
water
rub
of
wings
the
of
dandies
crown
the
hiss
of
raindrop
spilling
down
the
purr
of
cat
the
trill
of
bird
and
whispering
i
heard
from
willy
wind
in
leaves
and
grass
and
all
the
distant
drones
that
pass
a
song
as
tender
and
as
light
as
flower
or
butterfly
in
flight
and
when
i
saw
it
opening
i
let
it
fly
and
sing
he
was
still
muttering
it
over
to
himself
at
the
window
when
he
heard
his
name
called
and
turning
round
saw
fleur
at
that
amazing
apparition
he
made
at
first
no
movement
and
no
sound
while
her
clear
vivid
glance
ravished
his
heart
then
he
went
forward
to
the
table
saying
how
nice
of
you
to
come
and
saw
her
flinch
as
if
he
had
thrown
something
at
her
i
asked
for
you
she
said
and
they
showed
me
up
here
but
i
can
go
away
jon
clutched
the
table
her
face
and
figure
in
its
frilly
frock
photographed
itself
with
such
startling
vividness
upon
his
eyes
that
if
she
had
sunk
through
the
floor
he
must
still
have
seen
her
i
know
i
told
you
a
lie
jon
but
i
told
it
out
of
yes
oh
yes
that
nothing
i
did
answer
your
letter
what
was
the
was
anything
to
answer
i
wanted
to
see
you
she
held
out
both
her
hands
and
jon
grasped
them
across
the
table
he
tried
to
say
something
but
all
his
attention
was
given
to
trying
not
to
hurt
her
hands
his
own
felt
so
hard
and
hers
so
soft
she
said
almost
defiantly
that
old
it
so
very
dreadful
in
his
voice
too
there
was
a
note
of
defiance
she
dragged
her
hands
away
i
did
think
in
these
days
boys
were
tied
to
their
mothers
jon
chin
went
up
as
if
he
had
been
struck
oh
i
did
mean
it
jon
what
a
horrible
thing
to
say
swiftly
she
came
close
to
him
jon
dear
i
did
mean
all
she
had
put
her
two
hands
on
his
shoulder
and
her
forehead
down
on
them
the
brim
of
her
hat
touched
his
neck
and
he
felt
it
quivering
but
in
a
sort
of
paralysis
he
made
no
response
she
let
go
of
his
shoulder
and
drew
away
well
i
go
if
you
do
want
me
but
i
never
thought
you
have
given
me
i
have
cried
jon
coming
suddenly
to
life
i
ca
i
try
her
eyes
gleamed
she
swayed
toward
him
love
you
do
give
me
up
if
you
do
i
do
know
feel
so
desperate
what
does
it
that
with
this
she
clung
to
him
he
kissed
her
eyes
her
cheeks
her
lips
but
while
he
kissed
her
he
saw
the
sheets
of
that
letter
fallen
down
on
the
floor
of
his
father
white
dead
mother
kneeling
before
it
fleur
whispered
make
her
promise
oh
jon
try
seemed
childish
in
his
ear
he
felt
curiously
old
i
promise
he
muttered
only
you
do
she
wants
to
spoil
our
lives
just
yes
of
what
again
that
challenge
in
his
voice
and
she
did
not
answer
her
arms
tightened
round
him
and
he
returned
her
kisses
but
even
while
he
yielded
the
poison
worked
in
him
the
poison
of
the
letter
fleur
did
not
know
she
did
not
misjudged
his
mother
she
came
from
the
enemy
camp
so
lovely
and
he
loved
her
even
in
her
embrace
he
could
not
help
the
memory
of
holly
words
i
think
she
has
a
nature
and
his
mother
my
darling
boy
do
think
of
of
yourself
when
she
was
gone
like
a
passionate
dream
leaving
her
image
on
his
eyes
her
kisses
on
his
lips
such
an
ache
in
his
heart
jon
leaned
in
the
window
listening
to
the
car
bearing
her
away
still
the
scent
as
of
warm
strawberries
still
the
little
summer
sounds
that
should
make
his
song
still
all
the
promise
of
youth
and
happiness
in
sighing
floating
fluttering
his
heart
torn
yearning
strong
in
him
hope
high
in
him
yet
with
its
eyes
cast
down
as
if
ashamed
the
miserable
task
before
him
if
fleur
was
desperate
so
was
the
poplars
swaying
the
white
clouds
passing
the
sunlight
on
the
grass
he
waited
till
evening
till
after
their
almost
silent
dinner
till
his
mother
had
played
to
him
and
still
he
waited
feeling
that
she
knew
what
he
was
waiting
to
say
she
kissed
him
and
went
and
still
he
lingered
watching
the
moonlight
and
the
moths
and
that
unreality
of
colouring
which
steals
along
and
stains
a
summer
night
and
he
would
have
given
anything
to
be
back
again
in
the
three
months
back
or
away
forward
years
in
the
future
the
present
with
this
dark
cruelty
of
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
seemed
impossible
he
realised
now
so
much
more
keenly
what
his
mother
felt
than
he
had
at
first
as
if
the
story
in
that
letter
had
been
a
poisonous
germ
producing
a
kind
of
fever
of
partisanship
so
that
he
really
felt
there
were
two
camps
his
mother
and
and
her
father
it
might
be
a
dead
thing
that
old
tragic
ownership
and
enmity
but
dead
things
were
poisonous
till
time
had
cleaned
them
away
even
his
love
felt
tainted
less
illusioned
more
of
the
earth
and
with
a
treacherous
lurking
doubt
lest
fleur
like
her
father
might
want
to
own
not
articulate
just
a
stealing
haunt
horribly
unworthy
which
crept
in
and
about
the
ardour
of
his
memories
touched
with
its
tarnishing
breath
the
vividness
and
grace
of
that
charmed
face
and
doubt
not
real
enough
to
convince
him
of
its
presence
just
real
enough
to
deflower
a
perfect
faith
and
perfect
faith
to
jon
not
yet
twenty
was
essential
he
still
had
youth
eagerness
to
give
with
both
hands
to
take
with
give
lovingly
to
one
who
had
his
own
impulsive
generosity
surely
she
had
he
got
up
from
the
and
roamed
in
the
big
grey
ghostly
room
whose
walls
were
hung
with
silvered
canvas
this
house
his
father
said
in
that
been
built
for
his
mother
to
live
fleur
father
he
put
out
his
hand
in
the
as
if
to
grasp
the
shadowy
hand
of
the
dead
he
clenched
trying
to
feel
the
thin
vanished
fingers
of
his
father
to
squeeze
them
and
reassure
him
that
was
on
his
father
side
tears
prisoned
within
him
made
his
eyes
feel
dry
and
hot
he
went
back
to
the
window
it
was
warmer
not
so
eerie
more
comforting
outside
where
the
moon
hung
golden
three
days
off
full
the
freedom
of
the
night
was
comforting
if
only
fleur
and
he
had
met
on
some
desert
island
without
a
nature
for
their
house
jon
had
still
his
high
regard
for
desert
islands
where
breadfruit
grew
and
the
water
was
blue
above
the
coral
the
night
was
deep
was
was
enticement
in
it
a
lure
a
promise
a
refuge
from
entanglement
and
love
milksop
tied
to
his
mother
his
cheeks
burned
he
shut
the
window
drew
curtains
over
it
switched
off
the
lighted
sconce
and
went
the
door
of
his
room
was
open
the
light
turned
up
his
mother
still
in
her
evening
gown
was
standing
at
the
window
she
turned
and
said
sit
down
jon
let
she
sat
down
on
the
jon
on
his
bed
she
had
her
profile
turned
to
him
and
the
beauty
and
grace
of
her
figure
the
delicate
line
of
the
brow
the
nose
the
neck
the
strange
and
as
it
were
remote
refinement
of
her
moved
him
his
mother
never
belonged
to
her
surroundings
she
came
into
them
from
it
were
what
was
she
going
to
say
to
him
who
had
in
his
heart
such
things
to
say
to
her
i
know
fleur
came
i
not
it
was
as
though
she
had
added
she
is
her
father
daughter
and
jon
heart
hardened
irene
went
on
quietly
i
have
father
letter
i
picked
it
up
that
night
and
kept
it
would
you
like
it
back
dear
jon
shook
his
head
i
had
read
it
of
course
before
he
gave
it
to
you
it
did
quite
do
justice
to
my
mother
burst
from
jon
lips
he
put
it
very
sweetly
but
i
know
that
in
marrying
fleur
father
without
love
i
did
a
dreadful
thing
an
unhappy
marriage
jon
can
play
such
havoc
with
other
lives
besides
one
own
you
are
fearfully
young
my
darling
and
fearfully
loving
do
you
think
you
can
possibly
be
happy
with
this
girl
staring
at
her
dark
eyes
darker
now
from
pain
jon
answered
yes
oh
you
could
irene
smiled
admiration
of
beauty
and
longing
for
possession
are
not
love
if
yours
were
another
case
like
mine
the
deepest
things
are
stifled
the
flesh
joined
and
the
spirit
at
war
why
should
it
mother
you
think
she
must
be
like
her
father
but
not
i
seen
again
the
smile
came
on
irene
lips
and
in
jon
something
wavered
there
was
such
irony
and
experience
in
that
smile
you
are
a
giver
jon
she
is
a
that
unworthy
doubt
that
haunting
uncertainty
again
he
said
with
vehemence
she
is
it
only
because
i
ca
bear
to
make
you
unhappy
mother
now
that
he
thrust
his
fists
against
his
forehead
irene
got
up
i
told
you
that
night
dear
not
to
mind
me
i
meant
it
think
of
yourself
and
your
own
happiness
i
can
stand
what
brought
it
on
again
the
word
mother
burst
from
jon
lips
she
came
over
to
him
and
put
her
hands
over
his
do
you
feel
your
head
darling
jon
shook
it
what
he
felt
was
in
his
sort
of
tearing
asunder
of
the
tissue
there
by
the
two
loves
i
shall
always
love
you
the
same
jon
whatever
you
do
you
wo
lose
she
smoothed
his
hair
gently
and
walked
away
he
heard
the
door
shut
and
rolling
over
on
the
bed
lay
stifling
his
breath
with
an
awful
feeling
within
him
enquiring
for
her
at
tea
time
soames
learned
that
fleur
had
been
out
in
the
car
since
two
three
hours
where
had
she
gone
up
to
london
without
a
word
to
him
he
had
never
become
quite
reconciled
with
cars
he
had
embraced
them
in
the
born
empiricist
or
forsyte
that
he
each
symptom
of
progress
as
it
came
along
with
well
we
could
do
without
them
but
in
fact
he
found
them
tearing
great
smelly
things
obliged
by
annette
to
have
rollhard
with
cushions
electric
light
little
mirrors
trays
for
the
ashes
of
cigarettes
flower
smelling
of
petrol
and
regarded
it
much
as
he
used
to
regard
his
montague
dartie
the
thing
typified
all
that
was
fast
insecure
and
subcutaneously
oily
in
modern
life
as
modern
life
became
faster
looser
younger
soames
was
becoming
older
slower
tighter
more
and
more
in
thought
and
language
like
his
father
james
before
him
he
was
almost
aware
of
it
himself
pace
and
progress
pleased
him
less
and
less
there
was
an
ostentation
too
about
a
car
which
he
considered
provocative
in
the
prevailing
mood
of
labour
on
one
occasion
that
fellow
sims
had
driven
over
the
only
vested
interest
of
a
working
man
soames
had
not
forgotten
the
behaviour
of
its
master
when
not
many
people
would
have
stopped
to
put
up
with
it
he
had
been
sorry
for
the
dog
and
quite
prepared
to
take
its
part
against
the
car
if
that
ruffian
had
been
so
outrageous
with
four
hours
fast
becoming
five
and
still
no
fleur
all
the
old
feelings
he
had
experienced
in
person
and
by
proxy
balled
within
him
and
sinking
sensations
troubled
the
pit
of
his
stomach
at
seven
he
telephoned
to
winifred
by
trunk
call
no
fleur
had
not
been
to
green
street
then
where
was
she
visions
of
his
beloved
daughter
rolled
up
in
her
pretty
frills
all
blood
and
in
some
hideous
catastrophe
began
to
haunt
him
he
went
to
her
room
and
spied
among
her
things
she
had
taken
no
jewellery
and
this
a
relief
in
one
sense
increased
his
fears
of
an
accident
terrible
to
be
helpless
when
his
loved
one
was
missing
especially
when
he
could
bear
fuss
or
publicity
of
any
kind
what
should
he
do
if
she
were
not
back
by
nightfall
at
a
quarter
to
eight
he
heard
the
car
a
great
weight
lifted
from
off
his
heart
he
hurried
down
she
was
getting
and
but
nothing
wrong
he
met
her
in
the
hall
you
frightened
me
where
have
you
been
to
robin
hill
i
sorry
dear
i
had
to
go
i
tell
you
and
with
a
flying
kiss
she
ran
soames
waited
in
the
to
robin
hill
what
did
that
portend
it
was
not
a
subject
they
could
discuss
at
to
the
susceptibilities
of
the
butler
the
agony
of
nerves
soames
had
been
through
the
relief
he
felt
at
her
safety
softened
his
power
to
condemn
what
she
had
done
or
resist
what
she
was
going
to
do
he
waited
in
a
relaxed
stupor
for
her
revelation
life
was
a
queer
business
there
he
was
at
and
no
more
in
command
of
things
than
if
he
had
not
spent
forty
years
in
building
up
something
one
get
on
terms
with
in
the
pocket
of
his
was
a
letter
from
annette
she
was
coming
back
in
a
fortnight
he
knew
nothing
of
what
she
had
been
doing
out
there
and
he
was
glad
that
he
did
not
her
absence
had
been
a
relief
out
of
sight
was
out
of
mind
and
now
she
was
coming
back
another
worry
and
the
bolderby
old
crome
was
had
got
because
that
anonymous
letter
had
put
it
out
of
his
thoughts
he
furtively
remarked
the
strained
look
on
his
daughter
face
as
if
she
too
were
gazing
at
a
picture
that
she
could
buy
he
almost
wished
the
war
back
worries
did
seem
then
quite
so
worrying
from
the
caress
in
her
voice
the
look
on
her
face
he
became
certain
that
she
wanted
something
from
him
uncertain
whether
it
would
be
wise
of
him
to
give
it
her
he
pushed
his
savoury
away
uneaten
and
even
joined
her
in
a
cigarette
after
dinner
she
set
the
electric
going
and
he
augured
the
worst
when
she
sat
down
on
a
cushion
footstool
at
his
knee
and
put
her
hand
on
his
darling
be
nice
to
me
i
had
to
see
wrote
to
me
he
going
to
try
what
he
can
do
with
his
mother
but
i
been
thinking
it
really
in
your
hands
father
if
you
persuade
her
that
it
does
mean
renewing
the
past
in
any
way
that
i
shall
stay
yours
and
jon
will
stay
hers
that
you
need
never
see
him
or
her
and
she
need
never
see
you
or
me
only
you
could
persuade
her
dear
because
only
you
could
promise
one
ca
promise
for
other
people
surely
it
would
be
too
awkward
for
you
to
see
her
just
this
once
now
that
jon
father
is
dead
too
awkward
soames
repeated
the
whole
thing
you
know
said
fleur
without
looking
up
you
would
mind
seeing
her
soames
was
silent
her
words
had
expressed
a
truth
too
deep
for
him
to
admit
she
slipped
her
fingers
between
his
slim
eager
they
clung
there
this
child
of
his
would
corkscrew
her
way
into
a
brick
wall
what
am
i
to
do
if
you
wo
father
she
said
very
softly
i
do
anything
for
your
happiness
said
soanies
but
this
is
for
your
oh
it
is
it
is
it
only
stir
things
up
he
said
grimly
but
they
are
stirred
up
the
thing
is
to
quiet
them
to
make
her
feel
that
this
is
just
our
lives
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
yours
or
hers
you
can
do
it
father
i
know
you
you
know
a
great
deal
then
was
soames
glum
answer
if
you
will
jon
and
i
will
wait
a
years
if
you
it
seems
to
me
murmured
soames
that
you
care
nothing
about
what
i
fleur
pressed
his
hand
against
her
cheek
i
do
darling
but
you
would
like
me
to
be
awfully
how
she
wheedled
to
get
her
ends
and
trying
with
all
his
might
to
think
she
really
cared
for
was
not
sure
all
she
cared
for
was
this
boy
why
should
he
help
her
to
get
this
boy
who
was
killing
her
affection
for
himself
why
should
he
by
the
laws
of
the
forsytes
it
was
foolish
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
out
of
to
give
her
to
that
boy
to
pass
her
into
the
enemy
camp
under
the
influence
of
the
woman
who
had
injured
him
so
deeply
would
lose
this
flower
of
his
life
and
suddenly
he
was
conscious
that
his
hand
was
wet
his
heart
gave
a
little
painful
jump
he
could
bear
her
to
cry
he
put
his
other
hand
quickly
over
hers
and
a
tear
dropped
on
that
too
he
could
go
on
like
this
well
well
he
said
i
think
it
over
and
do
what
i
can
come
come
if
she
must
have
it
for
her
must
he
could
refuse
to
help
her
and
lest
she
should
begin
to
thank
him
he
got
out
of
his
chair
and
went
up
to
the
that
noise
it
ran
down
as
he
reached
it
with
a
faint
buzz
that
musical
box
of
his
nursery
days
the
harmonious
blacksmith
glorious
port
thing
had
always
made
him
miserable
when
his
mother
set
it
going
on
sunday
afternoons
here
it
was
same
thing
only
larger
more
expensive
and
now
it
played
the
wild
wild
women
and
the
policeman
holiday
and
he
was
no
longer
in
black
velvet
with
a
sky
blue
collar
right
he
thought
nothing
in
it
we
all
progressing
to
the
grave
and
with
that
surprising
mental
comment
he
walked
out
he
did
not
see
fleur
again
that
night
but
at
breakfast
her
eyes
followed
him
about
with
an
appeal
he
could
not
that
he
intended
to
try
no
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
the
business
he
would
go
to
robin
that
house
of
memories
pleasant
last
of
going
down
to
keep
that
boy
father
and
irene
apart
by
threatening
divorce
he
had
often
thought
since
that
it
had
clinched
their
union
and
now
he
was
going
to
clinch
the
union
of
that
boy
with
his
girl
do
know
what
i
done
he
thought
have
such
things
thrust
on
me
he
went
up
by
train
and
down
by
train
and
from
the
station
walked
by
the
long
rising
lane
still
very
much
as
he
remembered
it
over
thirty
years
ago
near
london
some
one
evidently
was
holding
on
to
the
land
there
this
speculation
soothed
him
moving
between
the
high
hedges
slowly
so
as
not
to
get
overheated
though
the
day
was
chill
enough
after
all
was
said
and
done
there
was
something
real
about
land
it
did
shift
land
and
good
pictures
the
values
might
fluctuate
a
bit
but
on
the
whole
they
were
always
going
holding
on
to
in
a
world
where
there
was
such
a
lot
of
unreality
cheap
building
changing
fashions
such
a
here
and
gone
spirit
the
french
were
right
perhaps
with
their
peasant
proprietorship
though
he
had
no
opinion
of
the
french
bit
of
land
something
solid
in
it
he
had
heard
peasant
proprietors
described
as
a
lot
had
heard
young
mont
call
his
father
a
pigheaded
morning
young
devil
well
there
were
worse
things
than
being
or
reading
the
morning
post
there
was
profond
and
his
tribe
and
all
these
labour
chaps
and
politicians
and
wild
women
a
lot
of
worse
things
and
suddenly
soames
became
conscious
of
feeling
weak
and
hot
and
shaky
sheer
nerves
at
the
meeting
before
him
as
aunt
juley
might
have
superior
dosset
nerves
were
in
a
proper
he
could
see
the
house
now
among
its
trees
the
house
he
had
watched
being
built
intending
it
for
himself
and
this
woman
who
by
such
strange
fate
had
lived
in
it
with
another
after
all
he
began
to
think
of
dumetrius
local
loans
and
other
forms
of
investment
he
could
not
afford
to
meet
her
with
his
nerves
all
shaking
he
who
represented
the
day
of
judgment
for
her
on
earth
as
it
was
in
heaven
he
legal
ownership
personified
meeting
lawless
beauty
incarnate
his
dignity
demanded
impassivity
during
this
embassy
designed
to
link
their
offspring
who
if
she
had
behaved
herself
would
have
been
brother
and
sister
that
wretched
tune
the
wild
wild
women
kept
running
in
his
head
perversely
for
tunes
did
not
run
there
as
a
rule
passing
the
poplars
in
front
of
the
house
he
thought
they
grown
i
had
them
planted
a
maid
answered
his
ring
will
you
forsyte
on
a
very
special
if
she
realised
who
he
was
quite
probably
she
would
not
see
him
george
he
thought
hardening
as
the
tug
came
a
affair
the
maid
came
back
would
the
gentleman
state
his
business
please
say
it
concerns
jon
said
soames
and
once
more
he
was
alone
in
that
hall
with
the
pool
of
marble
designed
by
her
first
lover
ah
she
had
been
a
bad
loved
two
men
and
not
himself
he
must
remember
that
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
her
once
more
and
suddenly
he
saw
her
in
the
opening
chink
between
the
long
heavy
purple
curtains
swaying
as
if
in
hesitation
the
old
perfect
poise
and
line
the
old
startled
gravity
the
old
calm
defensive
voice
will
you
come
in
please
he
passed
through
that
opening
as
in
the
and
the
confectioner
shop
she
seemed
to
him
still
beautiful
and
this
was
the
first
very
he
married
her
years
ago
that
he
was
speaking
to
her
without
the
legal
right
to
call
her
his
she
was
not
wearing
of
that
fellow
radical
notions
he
supposed
i
apologise
for
coming
he
said
glumly
but
this
business
must
be
settled
one
way
or
the
wo
you
sit
down
no
thank
anger
at
his
false
position
impatience
of
ceremony
between
them
mastered
him
and
words
came
tumbling
out
it
an
infernal
mischance
i
done
my
best
to
discourage
it
i
consider
my
daughter
crazy
but
i
got
into
the
habit
of
indulging
her
that
why
i
here
i
suppose
you
fond
of
your
well
it
rests
with
he
had
a
sense
of
being
met
and
baffled
she
had
baffled
him
even
in
those
old
first
married
days
it
a
mad
notion
he
said
it
if
you
had
might
have
he
did
not
finish
that
sentence
brother
and
sister
and
all
this
saved
but
he
saw
her
shudder
as
if
he
had
and
stung
by
the
sight
he
crossed
over
to
the
window
out
there
the
trees
had
not
could
they
were
old
so
far
as
i
concerned
he
said
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
i
desire
to
see
neither
you
nor
your
son
if
this
marriage
comes
about
young
people
in
these
days
unaccountable
but
i
ca
bear
to
see
my
daughter
unhappy
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
when
i
go
back
please
say
to
her
as
i
said
to
you
that
it
rests
with
you
do
oppose
it
with
all
my
heart
not
with
my
soames
stood
biting
his
finger
i
remember
an
he
said
suddenly
and
was
silent
what
was
was
there
in
this
woman
that
would
not
fit
into
the
four
corners
of
his
hate
or
condemnation
where
is
son
up
in
his
father
studio
i
perhaps
you
have
him
he
watched
her
ring
the
bell
he
watched
the
maid
come
in
please
tell
jon
that
i
want
if
it
rests
with
him
said
soames
hurriedly
when
the
maid
was
gone
i
suppose
i
may
take
it
for
granted
that
this
unnatural
marriage
will
take
place
in
that
case
there
be
formalities
whom
do
i
deal
irene
nodded
you
do
propose
to
live
with
them
irene
shook
her
head
what
happens
to
this
house
it
will
be
as
jon
this
house
said
soames
suddenly
i
had
hopes
when
i
began
it
if
they
live
in
children
they
say
there
such
a
thing
as
nemesis
do
you
believe
in
it
oh
you
do
he
had
come
back
from
the
window
and
was
standing
close
to
her
who
in
the
curve
of
her
grand
piano
was
as
it
were
embayed
i
not
likely
to
see
you
again
he
said
slowly
will
you
shake
hands
lip
quivered
the
words
came
out
and
let
the
past
he
held
out
his
hand
her
pale
face
grew
paler
her
eyes
so
dark
rested
immovably
on
his
her
hands
remained
clasped
in
front
of
her
he
heard
a
sound
and
turned
that
boy
was
standing
in
the
opening
of
the
curtains
very
queer
he
looked
hardly
recognisable
as
the
young
fellow
he
had
seen
in
the
gallery
off
cork
queer
much
older
no
youth
in
the
face
at
rigid
his
hair
ruffled
his
eyes
deep
in
his
head
soames
made
an
effort
and
said
with
a
lift
of
his
lip
not
quite
a
smile
nor
quite
a
sneer
well
young
man
i
here
for
my
daughter
it
rests
with
you
it
matter
your
mother
leaves
it
in
your
the
boy
continued
staring
at
his
mother
face
and
made
no
answer
for
my
daughter
sake
i
brought
myself
to
come
said
soames
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
when
i
go
back
still
looking
at
his
mother
the
boy
said
quietly
tell
fleur
that
it
no
good
please
i
must
do
as
my
father
wished
before
he
jon
it
all
right
in
a
kind
of
stupefaction
soames
looked
from
one
to
the
other
then
taking
up
hat
and
umbrella
which
he
had
put
down
on
a
chair
he
walked
toward
the
curtains
the
boy
stood
aside
for
him
to
go
by
he
passed
through
and
heard
the
grate
of
the
rings
as
the
curtains
were
drawn
behind
him
the
sound
liberated
something
in
his
chest
that
that
he
thought
and
passed
out
of
the
front
door
dark
tune
as
soames
walked
away
from
the
house
at
robin
hill
the
sun
broke
through
the
grey
of
that
chill
afternoon
in
smoky
radiance
so
absorbed
in
landscape
painting
that
he
seldom
looked
seriously
for
effects
of
nature
out
of
was
struck
by
that
moody
mourned
with
a
triumph
suited
to
his
own
feeling
victory
in
defeat
his
embassy
had
come
to
naught
but
he
was
rid
of
those
people
had
regained
his
daughter
at
the
expense
happiness
what
would
fleur
say
to
him
would
she
believe
he
had
done
his
best
and
under
that
sunlight
faring
on
the
elms
hazels
hollies
of
the
lane
and
those
unexploited
fields
soames
felt
dread
she
would
be
terribly
upset
he
must
appeal
to
her
pride
that
boy
had
given
her
up
declared
part
and
lot
with
the
woman
who
so
long
ago
had
given
her
father
up
soames
clenched
his
hands
given
him
up
and
why
what
had
been
wrong
with
him
and
once
more
he
felt
the
malaise
of
one
who
contemplates
himself
as
seen
by
a
dog
who
chances
on
his
refection
in
a
mirror
and
is
intrigued
and
anxious
at
the
unseizable
thing
not
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
he
dined
in
town
at
the
connoisseurs
while
eating
a
pear
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
had
not
gone
down
to
robin
hill
the
boy
might
not
have
so
decided
he
remembered
the
expression
on
his
face
while
his
mother
was
refusing
the
hand
he
had
held
out
a
strange
an
awkward
thought
had
fleur
cooked
her
own
goose
by
trying
to
make
too
sure
he
reached
home
at
nine
while
the
car
was
passing
in
at
one
drive
gate
he
heard
the
grinding
sputter
of
a
passing
out
by
the
other
young
mont
no
doubt
so
fleur
had
not
been
lonely
but
he
went
in
with
a
sinking
heart
in
the
she
was
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
on
her
clasped
hands
in
front
of
a
white
camellia
plant
which
filled
the
fireplace
that
glance
at
her
before
she
saw
him
renewed
his
dread
what
was
she
seeing
among
those
white
camellias
well
father
soames
shook
his
head
his
tongue
failed
him
this
was
murderous
work
he
saw
her
eyes
dilate
her
lips
quivering
what
what
quick
father
my
dear
said
soames
did
my
best
and
again
he
shook
his
head
fleur
ran
to
him
and
put
a
hand
on
each
of
his
shoulders
she
no
muttered
soames
he
i
was
to
tell
you
that
it
was
no
use
he
must
do
what
his
father
wished
before
he
he
caught
her
by
the
waist
come
child
do
let
them
hurt
you
they
not
worth
your
little
fleur
tore
herself
from
his
grasp
you
did
have
tried
betrayed
me
father
bitterly
wounded
soames
gazed
at
her
passionate
figure
writhing
there
in
front
of
him
you
did
was
a
fool
i
wo
believe
he
ever
could
only
yesterday
oh
why
did
i
ask
you
yes
said
soames
quietly
why
did
you
i
swallowed
my
feelings
i
did
my
best
for
you
against
my
this
is
my
reward
with
every
nerve
in
his
body
twitching
he
went
toward
the
door
fleur
darted
after
him
he
gives
me
up
you
mean
that
father
soames
turned
and
forced
himself
to
answer
oh
cried
fleur
what
did
could
you
have
done
in
those
old
days
the
breathless
sense
of
really
monstrous
injustice
cut
the
power
of
speech
in
soames
throat
what
had
he
done
what
had
they
done
to
him
and
with
quite
unconscious
dignity
he
put
his
hand
on
his
breast
and
looked
at
her
it
a
shame
cried
fleur
passionately
soames
went
out
he
mounted
slow
and
icy
to
his
picture
gallery
and
paced
among
his
treasures
outrageous
oh
outrageous
she
was
spoiled
ah
and
who
had
spoiled
her
he
stood
still
before
the
goya
copy
accustomed
to
her
own
way
in
everything
flower
of
his
life
and
now
that
she
could
have
it
he
turned
to
the
window
for
some
air
daylight
was
dying
the
moon
rising
gold
behind
the
poplars
what
sound
was
that
why
that
piano
thing
a
dark
tune
with
a
thrum
and
a
throb
she
had
set
it
comfort
could
she
get
from
that
his
eyes
caught
movement
down
there
beyond
the
lawn
under
the
trellis
of
rambler
roses
and
young
where
the
moonlight
fell
there
she
was
roaming
up
and
down
his
heart
gave
a
little
sickening
jump
what
would
she
do
under
this
blow
how
could
he
tell
what
did
he
know
of
had
only
loved
her
all
his
on
her
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
he
knew
no
notion
there
she
that
dark
the
river
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
must
go
out
he
thought
he
hastened
down
to
the
lighted
just
as
he
had
left
it
with
the
piano
thrumming
out
that
waltz
or
or
whatever
they
called
it
in
these
days
and
passed
through
on
to
the
verandah
where
could
he
watch
without
her
seeing
him
and
he
stole
down
through
the
fruit
garden
to
the
he
was
between
her
and
the
river
now
and
his
heart
felt
lighter
she
was
his
daughter
and
would
do
anything
foolish
but
there
it
did
know
from
the
boat
house
window
he
could
see
the
last
acacia
and
the
spin
of
her
skirt
when
she
turned
in
her
restless
march
that
tune
had
run
down
at
goodness
he
crossed
the
floor
and
looked
through
the
farther
window
at
the
water
past
the
lilies
it
made
little
bubbles
against
them
bright
where
a
fell
he
remembered
suddenly
that
early
morning
when
he
had
slept
on
the
after
his
father
died
and
she
had
just
been
nineteen
years
ago
even
now
he
recalled
the
unaccustomed
world
when
he
woke
up
the
strange
feeling
it
had
given
him
that
day
the
second
passion
of
his
life
this
girl
of
his
roaming
under
the
acacias
what
a
comfort
she
had
been
to
him
and
all
the
soreness
and
sense
of
outrage
left
him
if
he
could
make
her
happy
again
he
did
care
an
owl
flew
queeking
queeking
a
bat
flitted
by
the
moonlight
brightened
and
broadened
on
the
water
how
long
was
she
going
to
roam
about
like
this
he
went
back
to
the
window
and
suddenly
saw
her
coming
down
to
the
bank
she
stood
quite
close
on
the
and
soames
watched
clenching
his
hands
should
he
speak
to
her
his
excitement
was
intense
the
stillness
of
her
figure
its
youth
its
absorption
in
despair
in
longing
he
would
always
remember
it
moonlit
like
that
and
the
faint
sweet
reek
of
the
river
and
the
shivering
of
the
willow
leaves
she
had
everything
in
the
world
that
he
could
give
her
except
the
one
thing
that
she
could
not
have
because
of
him
the
perversity
of
things
hurt
him
at
that
moment
as
might
a
in
his
throat
then
with
an
infinite
relief
he
saw
her
turn
back
toward
the
house
what
could
he
give
her
to
make
amends
pearls
travel
horses
other
young
she
he
might
lose
the
memory
of
her
young
figure
lonely
by
the
water
there
she
had
set
that
tune
going
again
was
a
mania
dark
thrumming
faint
travelling
from
the
house
it
was
as
though
she
had
said
if
i
ca
have
something
to
keep
me
going
i
shall
die
of
this
soames
dimly
understood
well
if
it
helped
her
let
her
keep
it
thrumming
on
all
night
and
mousing
back
through
the
fruit
garden
he
regained
the
verandah
though
he
meant
to
go
in
and
speak
to
her
now
he
still
hesitated
not
knowing
what
to
say
trying
hard
to
recall
how
it
felt
to
be
thwarted
in
love
he
ought
to
know
ought
to
he
could
not
real
recollection
except
that
it
had
hurt
him
horribly
in
this
blankness
he
stood
passing
his
handkerchief
over
hands
and
lips
which
were
very
dry
by
craning
his
head
he
could
just
see
fleur
standing
with
her
back
to
that
piano
still
grinding
out
its
tune
her
arms
tight
crossed
on
her
breast
a
lighted
cigarette
between
her
lips
whose
smoke
half
veiled
her
face
the
expression
on
it
was
strange
to
soames
the
eyes
shone
and
stared
and
every
feature
was
alive
with
a
sort
of
wretched
scorn
and
anger
once
or
twice
he
had
seen
annette
look
like
face
was
too
vivid
too
naked
not
his
daughter
at
that
moment
and
he
dared
not
go
in
realising
the
futility
of
any
attempt
at
consolation
he
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
monstrous
trick
that
fate
had
played
him
nemesis
that
old
unhappy
marriage
and
in
god
how
was
he
to
know
when
he
wanted
irene
so
violently
and
she
consented
to
be
his
that
she
would
never
love
him
the
tune
died
and
was
renewed
and
died
again
and
still
soames
sat
in
the
shadow
waiting
for
he
knew
not
what
the
fag
of
fleur
cigarette
flung
through
the
window
fell
on
the
grass
he
watched
it
glowing
burning
itself
out
the
moon
had
freed
herself
above
the
poplars
and
poured
her
unreality
on
the
garden
comfortless
light
mysterious
the
beauty
of
that
woman
who
had
never
loved
the
nemesias
and
the
stocks
with
a
vesture
not
of
earth
flowers
and
his
flower
so
unhappy
ah
why
could
one
not
put
happiness
into
local
loans
gild
its
edges
insure
it
against
going
down
light
had
ceased
to
flow
out
now
from
the
window
all
was
silent
and
dark
in
there
had
she
gone
up
he
rose
and
tiptoeing
peered
in
it
seemed
so
he
entered
the
verandah
kept
the
moonlight
out
and
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
outlines
of
furniture
blacker
than
the
darkness
he
groped
toward
the
farther
window
to
shut
it
his
foot
struck
a
chair
and
he
heard
a
gasp
there
she
was
curled
and
crushed
into
the
corner
of
the
sofa
his
hand
hovered
did
she
want
his
consolation
he
stood
gazing
at
that
ball
of
crushed
frills
and
hair
and
graceful
youth
trying
to
burrow
its
way
out
of
sorrow
how
leave
her
there
at
last
he
touched
her
hair
and
said
come
darling
better
go
to
bed
i
make
it
up
to
you
how
fatuous
but
what
could
he
have
said
the
when
their
visitor
had
disappeared
jon
and
his
mother
stood
without
speaking
till
he
said
suddenly
i
ought
to
have
seen
him
but
soames
was
already
walking
down
the
drive
and
jon
went
upstairs
to
his
father
studio
not
trusting
himself
to
go
back
the
expression
on
his
mother
face
confronting
the
man
she
had
once
been
married
to
had
sealed
a
resolution
growing
within
him
ever
since
she
left
him
the
night
before
it
had
put
the
finishing
touch
of
reality
to
marry
fleur
would
be
to
hit
his
mother
in
the
face
to
betray
his
dead
father
it
was
no
good
jon
had
the
least
resentful
of
natures
he
bore
his
parents
no
grudge
in
this
hour
of
his
distress
for
one
so
young
there
was
a
rather
strange
power
in
him
of
seeing
things
in
some
sort
of
proportion
it
was
worse
for
fleur
worse
for
his
mother
even
than
it
was
for
him
harder
than
to
give
up
was
to
be
given
up
or
to
be
the
cause
of
some
one
you
loved
giving
up
for
you
he
must
not
would
not
behave
grudgingly
while
he
stood
watching
the
tardy
sunlight
he
had
again
that
sudden
vision
of
the
world
which
had
come
to
him
the
night
before
sea
on
sea
country
on
country
millions
on
millions
of
people
all
with
their
own
lives
energies
joys
griefs
and
with
things
they
had
to
give
up
and
separate
struggles
for
existence
even
though
he
might
be
willing
to
give
up
all
else
for
the
one
thing
he
could
have
he
would
be
a
fool
to
think
his
feelings
mattered
much
in
so
vast
a
world
and
to
behave
like
a
or
a
cad
he
pictured
the
people
who
had
millions
who
had
given
up
life
in
the
war
the
millions
whom
the
war
had
left
with
life
and
little
else
the
hungry
children
he
had
read
of
the
shattered
men
people
in
prison
every
kind
of
unfortunate
did
not
help
him
much
if
one
had
to
miss
a
meal
what
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
many
others
had
to
miss
it
too
there
was
more
distraction
in
the
thought
of
getting
away
out
into
this
vast
world
of
which
he
knew
nothing
yet
he
could
not
go
on
staying
here
walled
in
and
sheltered
with
everything
so
slick
and
comfortable
and
nothing
to
do
but
brood
and
think
what
might
have
been
he
could
not
go
back
to
wansdon
and
the
memories
of
fleur
if
he
saw
her
again
he
could
not
trust
himself
and
if
he
stayed
here
or
went
back
there
he
would
surely
see
her
while
they
were
within
reach
of
each
other
that
must
happen
to
go
far
away
and
quickly
was
the
only
thing
to
do
but
however
much
he
loved
his
mother
he
did
not
want
to
go
away
with
her
then
feeling
that
was
brutal
he
made
up
his
mind
desperately
to
propose
that
they
should
go
to
italy
for
two
hours
in
that
melancholy
room
he
tried
to
master
himself
then
dressed
solemnly
for
dinner
his
mother
had
done
the
same
they
ate
little
at
some
length
and
talked
of
his
father
catalogue
the
show
was
arranged
for
october
and
beyond
clerical
detail
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
after
dinner
she
put
on
a
cloak
and
they
went
out
walked
a
little
talked
a
little
till
they
were
standing
silent
at
last
beneath
the
ruled
by
the
thought
i
show
anything
i
show
all
jon
put
his
arm
through
hers
and
said
quite
casually
mother
let
go
to
irene
pressed
his
arm
and
said
as
casually
it
would
be
very
nice
but
i
been
thinking
you
ought
to
see
and
do
more
than
you
would
if
i
were
with
but
then
you
be
i
was
once
alone
for
more
than
twelve
years
besides
i
should
like
to
be
here
for
the
opening
of
father
jon
grip
tightened
round
her
arm
he
was
not
deceived
you
could
stay
here
all
by
yourself
it
too
not
here
perhaps
in
london
and
i
might
go
to
paris
after
the
show
opens
you
ought
to
have
a
year
at
least
jon
and
see
the
yes
i
like
to
see
the
world
and
rough
it
but
i
do
want
to
leave
you
all
my
dear
i
owe
you
that
at
least
if
it
for
your
good
it
be
for
mine
why
not
start
tomorrow
you
got
your
yes
if
i
going
it
had
better

at
once
i
wanted
to
stay

or
anywhere

you
mind
coming
presently
wherever
and
whenever
you
send
for
me
but
do
send
until
you
really
want
jon
drew
a
deep
breath
i
feel
england
they
stood
a
few
minutes
longer
under
the
out
to
where
the
grand
stand
at
epsom
was
veiled
in
evening
the
branches
kept
the
moonlight
from
them
so
that
it
only
fell
everywhere
the
fields
and
far
away
and
on
the
windows
of
the
creepered
house
behind
which
soon
would
be
to
let
wedding
the
october
paragraphs
describing
the
wedding
of
fleur
forsyte
to
michael
mont
hardly
conveyed
the
symbolic
significance
of
this
event
in
the
union
of
the
of
superior
dosset
with
the
heir
of
a
ninth
baronet
was
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
that
merger
of
class
in
class
which
buttresses
the
political
stability
of
a
realm
the
time
had
come
when
the
forsytes
might
resign
their
natural
resentment
against
a
flummery
not
theirs
by
birth
and
accept
it
as
the
still
more
natural
due
of
their
possessive
instincts
besides
they
had
to
mount
to
make
room
for
all
those
so
much
more
newly
rich
in
that
quiet
but
tasteful
ceremony
in
hanover
square
and
afterward
among
the
furniture
in
green
street
it
had
been
impossible
for
those
not
in
the
know
to
distinguish
the
forsyte
troop
from
the
mont
far
away
was
superior
dosset
now
was
there
in
the
crease
of
his
trousers
the
expression
of
his
moustache
his
accent
or
the
shine
on
his
a
pin
to
choose
between
soames
and
the
ninth
baronet
himself
was
not
fleur
as
quick
glancing
pretty
and
hard
as
the
likeliest
muskham
mont
or
charwell
filly
present
if
anything
the
forsytes
had
it
in
dress
and
looks
and
manners
they
had
become
upper
class
and
now
their
name
would
be
formally
recorded
in
the
stud
book
their
money
joined
to
land
whether
this
was
a
little
late
in
the
day
and
those
rewards
of
the
possessive
instinct
lands
and
money
destined
for
the
still
a
question
so
moot
that
it
was
not
mooted
after

said

extremis
on
the
bayswater
francie
had
reported
it
was
whispered
too
that
this
young
mont
was
a
sort
of
wise
of
him
and
in
the
nature
of
insurance
considering
the
days
they
lived
in
there
was
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
the
landed
classes
produced
that
sort
of
amiable
foolishness
at
times
turned
to
safe
uses
and
confined
to
theory
as
george
remarked
to
his
sister
francie
they
soon
be
having
give
him
the
church
with
white
flowers
and
something
blue
in
the
middle
of
the
east
window
looked
extremely
chaste
as
though
endeavouring
to
counteract
the
somewhat
lurid
phraseology
of
a
service
calculated
to
keep
the
thoughts
of
all
on
puppies
forsytes
haymans
tweetymans
sat
in
the
left
aisle
monts
charwells
muskhams
in
the
right
while
a
sprinkling
of
fleur
at
school
and
of
in
the
war
gaped
indiscriminately
from
either
side
and
three
maiden
ladies
who
had
dropped
in
on
their
way
from
brought
up
the
rear
together
with
two
mont
retainers
and
fleur
old
nurse
in
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
as
full
a
house
as
could
be
expected
val
dartie
who
sat
with
her
husband
in
the
third
row
squeezed
his
hand
more
than
once
during
the
performance
to
her
who
knew
the
plot
of
this
its
most
dramatic
moment
was
painful
wonder
if
jon
knows
by
instinct
she
out
in
british
columbia
she
had
received
a
letter
from
him
only
that
morning
which
had
made
her
smile
and
say
jon
in
british
columbia
val
because
he
wants
to
be
in
california
he
thinks
it
too
nice
oh
said
val
so
he
beginning
to
see
a
joke
he
bought
some
land
and
sent
for
his
what
on
earth
will
she
do
out
there
all
she
cares
about
is
jon
do
you
still
think
it
a
happy
release
val
shrewd
eyes
narrowed
to
grey
between
their
dark
lashes
fleur
would
have
suited
him
a
bit
she
not
bred
poor
little
fleur
sighed
holly
ah
it
was
marriage
the
young
man
mont
had
caught
her
on
the
rebound
of
course
in
the
reckless
mood
of
one
whose
ship
has
just
gone
down
such
a
plunge
could
not
but
val
put
outside
chance
there
was
little
to
be
told
from
the
back
view
of
her
young
cousin
veil
and
holly
eyes
reviewed
the
general
aspect
of
this
christian
wedding
she
who
had
made
a
which
had
been
successful
had
a
horror
of
unhappy
marriages
this
might
not
be
one
in
the
it
was
clearly
a
and
to
consecrate
a
in
this
fashion
with
manufactured
unction
before
a
crowd
of
fashionable
who
thought
otherwise
than
freely
or
not
at
all
when
they
were
dolled
to
her
as
near
a
sin
as
one
could
find
in
an
age
which
had
abolished
them
her
eyes
wandered
from
the
prelate
in
his
robes
a
forsytes
had
not
as
yet
produced
a
prelate
to
val
beside
her
was
the
mayfly
filly
at
fifteen
to
one
for
the
cambridgeshire
they
passed
on
and
caught
the
profile
of
the
ninth
baronet
in
counterfeitment
of
the
kneeling
process
she
could
just
see
the
neat
ruck
above
his
knees
where
he
had
pulled
his
trousers
up
and
thought
forgotten
to
pull
up
his
her
eyes
passed
to
the
pew
in
front
of
her
where
winifred
substantial
form
was
gowned
with
passion
and
on
again
to
soames
and
annette
kneeling
side
by
side
a
little
smile
came
on
her
profond
back
from
the
south
seas
of
the
channel
would
be
kneeling
too
about
six
rows
behind
yes
this
was
a
funny
small
business
however
it
turned
out
still
it
was
in
a
proper
church
and
would
be
in
the
proper
papers
morning
they
had
begun
a
hymn
she
could
hear
the
ninth
baronet
across
the
aisle
singing
of
the
hosts
of
midian
her
little
finger
touched
were
holding
the
same
a
tiny
thrill
passed
through
her
twenty
years
ago
he
stooped
and
whispered
i
say
remember
the
rat
the
rat
at
their
wedding
in
cape
colony
which
had
cleaned
its
whiskers
behind
the
table
at
the
registrar
and
between
her
little
and
third
forgers
she
squeezed
his
thumb
hard
the
hymn
was
over
the
prelate
had
begun
to
deliver
his
discourse
he
told
them
of
the
dangerous
times
they
lived
in
and
the
awful
conduct
of
the
house
of
lords
in
connection
with
divorce
they
were
all
the
trenches
under
the
poisonous
gas
of
the
prince
of
darkness
and
must
be
manful
the
purpose
of
marriage
was
children
not
mere
sinful
happiness
an
imp
danced
in
holly
eyelashes
were
meeting
whatever
happened
he
must
not
snore
her
finger
and
thumb
closed
on
his
thigh
till
he
stirred
uneasily
the
discourse
was
over
the
danger
past
they
were
signing
in
the
vestry
and
general
relaxation
had
set
in
a
voice
behind
her
said
will
she
stay
the
course
who
that
she
whispered
old
george
forsyte
holly
demurely
scrutinized
one
of
whom
she
had
often
heard
fresh
from
south
africa
and
ignorant
of
her
kith
and
kin
she
never
saw
one
without
an
almost
childish
curiosity
he
was
very
big
and
very
dapper
his
eyes
gave
her
a
funny
feeling
of
having
no
particular
clothes
they
off
she
heard
him
say
they
came
stepping
from
the
chancel
holly
looked
first
in
young
face
his
lips
and
ears
were
twitching
his
eyes
shifting
from
his
feet
to
the
hand
within
his
arm
stared
suddenly
before
them
as
if
to
face
a
firing
party
he
gave
holly
the
feeling
that
he
was
spiritually
intoxicated
but
fleur
ah
that
was
different
the
girl
was
perfectly
composed
prettier
than
ever
in
her
white
robes
and
veil
over
her
banged
dark
chestnut
hair
her
eyelids
hovered
demure
over
her
dark
hazel
eyes
outwardly
she
seemed
all
there
but
inwardly
where
was
she
as
those
two
passed
fleur
raised
her
restless
glint
of
those
clear
whites
remained
on
holly
vision
as
might
the
flutter
of
caged
bird
wings
in
green
street
winifred
stood
to
receive
just
a
little
less
composed
than
usual
soames
request
for
the
use
of
her
house
had
come
on
her
at
a
deeply
psychological
moment
under
the
influence
of
a
remark
of
prosper
profond
she
had
begun
to
exchange
her
empire
for
expressionistic
furniture
there
were
the
most
amusing
arrangements
with
violet
green
and
orange
blobs
and
scriggles
to
be
had
at
mealard
another
month
and
the
change
would
have
been
complete
just
now
the
very
intriguing
recruits
she
had
enlisted
did
not
march
too
well
with
the
old
guard
it
was
as
if
her
regiment
were
half
in
khaki
half
in
scarlet
and
bearskins
but
her
strong
and
comfortable
character
made
the
best
of
it
in
a
which
typified
perhaps
more
perfectly
than
she
imagined
the
imperialism
of
her
country
after
all
this
was
a
day
of
merger
and
you
could
have
too
much
of
it
her
eyes
travelled
indulgently
among
her
guests
soames
had
gripped
the
back
of
a
buhl
chair
young
mont
was
behind
that
awfully
amusing
screen
which
no
one
as
yet
had
been
able
to
explain
to
her
the
ninth
baronet
had
shied
violently
at
a
round
scarlet
table
inlaid
under
glass
with
blue
australian
butteries
wings
and
was
clinging
to
her
cabinet
francie
forsyte
had
seized
the
new
finely
carved
with
little
purple
grotesques
on
an
ebony
ground
george
over
by
the
old
spinet
was
holding
a
little
book
as
if
about
to
enter
bets
prosper
profond
was
twiddling
the
knob
of
the
open
door
black
with
panels
and
annette
hands
close
by
were
grasping
her
own
waist
two
muskhams
clung
to
the
balcony
among
the
plants
as
if
feeling
ill
lady
mont
thin
and
had
taken
up
her
glasses
and
was
gazing
at
the
central
light
shade
of
ivory
and
orange
dashed
with
deep
magenta
as
if
the
heavens
had
opened
everybody
in
fact
seemed
holding
on
to
something
only
fleur
still
in
her
bridal
dress
was
detached
from
all
support
flinging
her
words
and
glances
to
left
and
right
the
room
was
full
of
the
bubble
and
the
squeak
of
conversation
nobody
could
hear
anything
that
anybody
said
which
seemed
of
little
consequence
since
no
one
waited
for
anything
so
slow
as
an
answer
modern
conversation
seemed
to
winifred
so
different
from
the
days
of
her
prime
when
a
drawl
was
all
the
vogue
still
it
was
amusing
which
of
course
was
all
that
mattered
even
the
forsytes
were
talking
with
extreme
and
christopher
and
imogen
and
young
youngest
patrick
soames
of
course
was
silent
but
george
by
the
spinet
kept
up
a
running
commentary
and
francie
by
her
winifred
drew
nearer
to
the
ninth
baronet
he
seemed
to
promise
a
certain
repose
his
nose
was
fine
and
drooped
a
little
his
grey
moustaches
too
and
she
said
drawling
through
her
smile
it
rather
nice
is
it
his
reply
shot
out
of
his
smile
like
a
snipped
bread
pellet
remember
in
frazer
the
tribe
that
buries
the
bride
up
to
the
waist
he
spoke
as
fast
as
anybody
he
had
dark
lively
little
eyes
too
all
crinkled
round
like
a
catholic
priest
winifred
felt
suddenly
he
might
say
things
she
would
regret
they
always
so
she
murmured
and
moved
on
to
soames
he
was
curiously
still
and
winifred
saw
at
once
what
was
dictating
his
immobility
to
his
right
was
george
forsyte
to
his
left
annette
and
prosper
profond
he
could
not
move
without
either
seeing
those
two
together
or
the
reflection
of
them
in
george
forsyte
japing
eyes
he
was
quite
right
not
to
be
taking
notice
they
say
timothy
sinking
he
said
glumly
where
will
you
put
him
soames
he
counted
on
his
fingers
it
make
twelve
of
them
there
including
wives
how
do
you
think
fleur
looks
remarkably
soames
nodded
he
had
never
seen
her
look
prettier
yet
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
impression
that
this
business
was
still
that
crushed
figure
burrowing
into
the
corner
of
the
sofa
from
that
night
to
this
day
he
had
received
from
her
no
confidences
he
knew
from
his
chauffeur
that
she
had
made
one
more
attempt
on
robin
hill
and
drawn
empty
house
no
one
at
home
he
knew
that
she
had
received
a
letter
but
not
what
was
in
it
except
that
it
had
made
her
hide
herself
and
cry
he
had
remarked
that
she
looked
at
him
sometimes
when
she
thought
he
was
noticing
as
if
she
were
wondering
still
what
he
had
make
those
people
hate
him
so
well
there
it
was
annette
had
come
back
and
things
had
worn
on
through
the
miserable
till
suddenly
fleur
had
said
she
was
going
to
marry
young
mont
she
had
shown
him
a
little
more
affection
when
she
told
him
that
and
he
had
was
the
good
of
opposing
it
god
knew
that
he
had
never
wished
to
thwart
her
in
anything
and
the
young
man
seemed
quite
delirious
about
her
no
doubt
she
was
in
a
reckless
mood
and
she
was
young
absurdly
young
but
if
he
opposed
her
he
did
know
what
she
would
do
for
all
he
could
tell
she
might
want
to
take
up
a
profession
become
a
doctor
or
solicitor
some
nonsense
she
had
no
aptitude
for
painting
writing
music
in
his
view
the
legitimate
occupations
of
unmarried
women
if
they
must
do
something
in
these
days
on
the
whole
she
was
safer
married
for
he
could
see
too
well
how
feverish
and
restless
she
was
at
home
annette
too
had
been
in
favour
of
from
behind
the
veil
of
his
refusal
to
know
what
she
was
about
if
she
was
about
anything
annette
had
said
let
her
marry
this
young
man
he
is
a
nice
so
as
he
where
she
got
her
expressions
he
did
her
opinion
soothed
his
doubts
his
wife
whatever
her
conduct
had
clear
eyes
and
an
almost
depressing
amount
of
common
sense
he
had
settled
fifty
thousand
on
fleur
taking
care
that
there
was
no
cross
settlement
in
case
it
turn
out
well
could
it
turn
out
well
she
had
not
got
over
that
other
knew
they
were
to
go
to
spain
for
the
honeymoon
he
would
be
even
lonelier
when
she
was
gone
but
later
perhaps
she
would
forget
and
turn
to
him
again
winifred
voice
broke
on
his
reverie
why
of
all
there
in
a
things
she
wore
her
hair
straying
from
under
a
fillet
soames
saw
his
cousin
and
fleur
going
forward
to
greet
her
the
two
passed
from
their
view
out
on
to
the
stairway
really
said
winifred
she
does
the
most
impossible
things
fancy
her
coming
what
made
you
ask
her
muttered
soames
because
i
thought
she
would
accept
of
winifred
had
forgotten
that
behind
conduct
lies
the
main
trend
of
character
or
in
other
words
omitted
to
remember
that
fleur
was
now
a
lame
on
receiving
her
invitation
june
had
first
thought
would
go
near
them
for
the
world
and
then
one
morning
had
awakened
from
a
dream
of
fleur
waving
to
her
from
a
boat
with
a
wild
unhappy
gesture
and
she
had
changed
her
mind
when
fleur
came
forward
and
said
to
her
do
come
up
while
i
changing
my
dress
she
had
followed
up
the
stairs
the
girl
led
the
way
into
imogen
old
bedroom
set
ready
for
her
toilet
june
sat
down
on
the
bed
thin
and
upright
like
a
little
spirit
in
the
sear
and
yellow
fleur
locked
the
door
the
girl
stood
before
her
divested
of
her
wedding
dress
what
a
pretty
thing
she
was
i
suppose
you
think
me
a
fool
she
said
with
quivering
lips
when
it
was
to
have
been
jon
but
what
does
it
matter
michael
wants
me
and
i
do
care
it
get
me
away
from
diving
her
hand
into
the
frills
on
her
breast
she
brought
out
a
letter
jon
wrote
me
june
read
lake
okanagen
british
columbia
i
not
coming
back
to
england
bless
you
always
she
made
safe
you
see
said
fleur
june
handed
back
the
letter
that
not
fair
to
irene
she
said
she
always
told
jon
he
could
do
as
he
fleur
smiled
bitterly
tell
me
did
she
spoil
your
life
too
june
looked
up
nobody
can
spoil
a
life
my
dear
that
nonsense
things
happen
but
we
bob
with
a
sort
of
terror
she
saw
the
girl
sink
on
her
knees
and
bury
her
face
in
the
djibbah
a
strangled
sob
mounted
to
june
ears
it
all
right
she
murmured
do
there
there
but
the
point
of
the
girl
chin
was
pressed
ever
closer
into
her
thigh
and
the
sound
was
dreadful
of
her
sobbing
well
well
it
had
to
come
she
would
feel
better
afterward
june
stroked
the
short
hair
of
that
shapely
head
and
all
the
scattered
in
her
focussed
itself
and
passed
through
the
tips
of
her
fingers
into
the
girl
brain
do
sit
down
under
it
my
dear
she
said
at
last
we
ca
control
life
but
we
can
fight
it
make
the
best
of
things
i
had
to
i
held
on
like
you
and
i
cried
as
you
crying
now
and
look
at
me
fleur
raised
her
head
a
sob
merged
suddenly
into
a
little
choked
laugh
in
truth
it
was
a
thin
and
rather
wild
and
wasted
spirit
she
was
looking
at
but
it
had
brave
eyes
all
right
she
said
i
sorry
i
shall
forget
him
i
suppose
if
i
fly
fast
and
far
and
scrambling
to
her
feet
she
went
over
to
the
june
watched
her
removing
with
cold
water
the
traces
of
emotion
save
for
a
little
becoming
pinkness
there
was
nothing
left
when
she
stood
before
the
mirror
june
got
off
the
bed
and
took
a
in
her
hand
to
put
two
pins
into
the
wrong
places
was
all
the
vent
she
found
for
sympathy
give
me
a
kiss
she
said
when
fleur
was
ready
and
dug
her
chin
into
the
girl
warm
cheek
i
want
a
whiff
said
fleur
do
june
left
her
sitting
on
the
bed
with
a
cigarette
between
her
lips
and
her
eyes
half
closed
and
went
in
the
doorway
of
the
stood
soames
as
if
unquiet
at
his
daughter
tardiness
june
tossed
her
head
and
passed
down
on
to
the
her
cousin
francie
was
standing
there
look
said
june
pointing
with
her
chin
at
soames
that
man
fatal
how
do
you
mean
said
francie
fatal
june
did
not
answer
her
i
sha
wait
to
see
them
off
she
said
said
francie
and
her
eyes
of
a
celtic
grey
goggled
that
old
feud
really
it
was
quite
romantic
soames
moving
to
the
well
of
the
staircase
saw
june
go
and
drew
a
breath
of
satisfaction
why
did
fleur
come
they
would
miss
their
train
that
train
would
bear
her
away
from
him
yet
he
could
not
help
fidgeting
at
the
thought
that
they
would
lose
it
and
then
she
did
come
running
down
in
her
frock
and
black
velvet
cap
and
passed
him
into
the
he
saw
her
kiss
her
mother
her
aunt
wife
imogen
and
then
come
forth
quick
and
pretty
as
ever
how
would
she
treat
him
at
this
last
moment
of
her
girlhood
he
could
hope
for
much
her
lips
pressed
the
middle
of
his
cheek
daddy
she
said
and
was
past
and
gone
daddy
she
had
called
him
that
for
years
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
followed
slowly
down
there
was
all
the
folly
with
that
confetti
stuff
and
the
rest
of
it
to
go
through
with
yet
but
he
would
like
just
to
catch
her
smile
if
she
leaned
out
though
they
would
hit
her
in
the
eye
with
the
shoe
if
they
did
take
care
young
mont
voice
said
fervently
in
his
ear
sir
and
thank
you
i
so
fearfully
he
said
do
miss
your
he
stood
on
the
bottom
step
but
three
whence
he
could
see
above
the
silly
hats
and
heads
they
were
in
the
car
now
and
there
was
that
stuff
showering
and
there
went
the
shoe
a
flood
of
something
welled
up
in
soames
did
could
see
last
of
the
old
forsytes
when
they
came
to
prepare
that
terrific
symbol
timothy
one
pure
individualist
left
the
only
man
who
had
heard
of
the
great
found
him
even
death
had
undermined
his
soundness
to
smither
and
cook
that
preparation
came
like
final
evidence
of
what
they
had
never
believed
end
of
the
old
forsyte
family
on
earth
poor
timothy
must
now
take
a
harp
and
sing
in
the
company
of
miss
forsyte
julia
miss
hester
with
jolyon
swithin
james
roger
and
nicholas
of
the
party
whether
hayman
would
be
there
was
more
doubtful
seeing
that
she
had
been
cremated
secretly
cook
thought
that
timothy
would
be
had
always
been
so
set
against
barrel
organs
how
many
times
had
she
not
said
drat
the
thing
there
it
is
again
smither
you
better
run
up
and
see
what
you
can
and
in
her
heart
she
would
so
have
enjoyed
the
tunes
if
she
had
known
that
timothy
would
ring
the
bell
in
a
minute
and
say
here
take
him
a
halfpenny
and
tell
him
to
move
often
they
had
been
obliged
to
add
threepence
of
their
own
before
the
man
would
had
ever
underrated
the
value
of
emotion
luckily
he
had
taken
the
organs
for
in
his
last
years
which
had
been
a
comfort
and
they
had
been
able
to
enjoy
the
tunes
but
a
harp
cook
wondered
it
was
a
change
and
timothy
had
never
liked
change
but
she
did
not
speak
of
this
to
smither
who
did
so
take
a
line
of
her
own
in
regard
to
heaven
that
it
quite
put
one
about
sometimes
she
cried
while
timothy
was
being
prepared
and
they
all
had
sherry
afterward
out
of
the
yearly
christmas
bottle
which
would
not
be
needed
now
ah
dear
she
had
been
there
years
and
smither
and
now
they
would
be
going
to
a
tiny
house
in
tooting
to
live
on
their
savings
and
what
miss
hester
had
so
kindly
left
to
take
fresh
service
after
the
glorious
but
they
would
like
just
to
see
soames
again
and
dartie
and
miss
francie
and
miss
euphemia
and
even
if
they
had
to
take
their
own
cab
they
felt
they
must
go
to
the
funeral
for
six
years
timothy
had
been
their
baby
getting
younger
and
younger
every
day
till
at
last
he
had
been
too
young
to
live
they
spent
the
regulation
hours
of
waiting
in
polishing
and
dusting
in
catching
the
one
mouse
left
and
asphyxiating
the
last
beetle
so
as
to
leave
it
nice
discussing
with
each
other
what
they
would
buy
at
the
sale
miss
ann
workbox
miss
juley
that
is
julia
seaweed
album
the
miss
hester
had
crewelled
and
golden
curls
glued
into
a
black
frame
oh
they
must
have
the
price
of
things
had
gone
up
so
it
fell
to
soames
to
issue
invitations
for
the
funeral
he
had
them
drawn
up
by
gradman
in
his
blood
relations
and
no
flowers
six
carriages
were
ordered
the
will
would
be
read
afterward
at
the
house
he
arrived
at
eleven
to
see
that
all
was
ready
at
a
quarter
past
old
gradman
came
in
black
gloves
and
crape
on
his
hat
he
and
soames
stood
in
the
waiting
at
eleven
the
carriages
drew
up
in
a
long
row
but
no
one
else
appeared
gradman
said
it
surprises
me
soames
i
posted
them
i
do
know
said
soames
he
lost
touch
with
the
soames
had
often
noticed
in
old
days
how
much
more
neighbourly
his
family
were
to
the
dead
than
to
the
living
but
now
the
way
they
had
flocked
to
fleur
wedding
and
abstained
from
timothy
funeral
seemed
to
show
some
vital
change
there
might
of
course
be
another
reason
for
soames
felt
that
if
he
had
not
known
the
contents
of
timothy
will
he
might
have
stayed
away
himself
through
delicacy
timothy
had
left
a
lot
of
money
with
nobody
in
particular
to
leave
it
to
they
might
like
to
seem
to
expect
something
at
twelve
the
procession
left
the
door
timothy
alone
in
the
first
carriage
under
glass
then
soames
alone
then
gradman
alone
then
cook
and
smither
together
they
started
at
a
walk
but
were
soon
trotting
under
a
bright
sky
at
the
entrance
to
highgate
cemetery
they
were
delayed
by
service
in
the
chapel
soames
would
have
liked
to
stay
outside
in
the
sunshine
he
did
believe
a
word
of
it
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
form
of
insurance
which
could
not
safely
be
neglected
in
case
there
might
be
something
in
it
after
all
they
walked
up
two
and
and
gradman
cook
and
the
family
vault
it
was
not
very
distinguished
for
the
funeral
of
the
last
old
forsyte
he
took
gradman
into
his
carriage
on
the
way
back
to
the
bayswater
road
with
a
certain
glow
in
his
heart
he
had
a
surprise
in
pickle
for
the
old
chap
who
had
served
the
forsytes
treat
that
was
entirely
his
doing
how
well
he
remembered
saying
to
timothy
the
aunt
hester
funeral
well
uncle
timothy
there
gradman
he
taken
a
lot
of
trouble
for
the
family
what
do
you
say
to
leaving
him
five
thousand
and
his
surprise
seeing
the
difficulty
there
had
been
in
getting
timothy
to
leave
anything
when
timothy
had
nodded
and
now
the
old
chap
would
be
as
pleased
as
punch
for
gradman
he
knew
had
a
weak
heart
and
their
son
had
lost
a
leg
in
the
war
it
was
extraordinarily
gratifying
to
soames
to
have
left
him
five
thousand
pounds
of
timothy
money
they
sat
down
together
in
the
little
whose
a
vision
of
and
gold
with
every
unnaturally
bright
and
every
speck
of
dust
removed
from
every
piece
of
furniture
to
read
that
little
will
of
timothy
with
his
back
to
the
light
in
aunt
hester
chair
soames
faced
gradman
with
his
face
to
the
light
on
aunt
ann
sofa
and
crossing
his
legs
began
this
is
the
last
will
and
testament
of

soames
paused
old
gradman
was
leaning
forward
convulsively
gripping
a
stout
black
knee
with
each
of
his
thick
hands
his
mouth
had
fallen
open
so
that
the
gold
fillings
of
three
teeth
gleamed
his
eyes
were
blinking
two
tears
rolled
slowly
out
of
them
soames
read

for
the
benefit
of
such
male

as
soames
read
the
investment
and
attestation
clauses
and
ceasing
looked
at
gradman
the
old
fellow
was
wiping
his
brow
with
a
large
handkerchief
whose
brilliant
colour
supplied
a
sudden
festive
tinge
to
the
proceedings
my
word
soames
he
said
and
it
was
clear
that
the
lawyer
in
him
had
utterly
wiped
out
the
man

word
why
there
are
two
babies

i
glad
he
left
it
in
the
family
the
at
jobson
in
view
of
the
victorian
nature
of
the
far
more
freely
attended
than
the
funeral
though
not
by
cook
and
smither
for
soames
had
taken
it
on
himself
to
give
them
their
heart
desires
winifred
was
present
euphemia
and
francie
and
eustace
had
come
in
his
car
the
miniatures
barbizons
and
drawings
had
been
bought
in
by
soames
and
relics
of
no
marketable
value
were
set
aside
in
an
for
members
of
the
family
who
cared
to
have
mementoes
these
were
the
only
restrictions
upon
bidding
characterised
by
an
almost
tragic
languor
not
one
piece
of
furniture
no
picture
or
porcelain
figure
appealed
to
modern
taste
the
humming
birds
had
fallen
like
autumn
leaves
when
taken
from
where
they
had
not
hummed
for
sixty
years
it
was
painful
to
soames
to
see
the
chairs
his
aunts
had
sat
on
the
little
grand
piano
they
had
practically
never
played
the
books
whose
outsides
they
had
gazed
at
the
china
they
had
dusted
the
curtains
they
had
drawn
the
which
had
warmed
their
feet
above
all
the
beds
they
had
lain
and
died
to
little
dealers
and
the
housewives
of
fulham
and
could
one
do
buy
them
and
stick
them
in
a
no
they
had
to
go
the
way
of
all
flesh
and
furniture
and
be
worn
out
but
when
they
put
up
aunt
sofa
and
were
going
to
knock
it
down
for
thirty
shillings
he
cried
out
suddenly
five
pounds
the
sensation
was
considerable
and
the
sofa
his
when
that
little
sale
was
over
in
the
fusty
saleroom
and
those
victorian
ashes
scattered
he
went
out
into
the
misty
october
sunshine
feeling
as
if
cosiness
had
died
out
of
the
world
and
the
board
to
let
was
up
indeed
revolutions
on
the
horizon
fleur
in
spain
no
comfort
in
annette
no
timothy
on
the
bayswater
road
in
the
irritable
desolation
of
his
soul
he
went
into
the
goupenor
gallery
that
chap
jolyon
watercolours
were
on
view
there
he
went
in
to
look
down
his
nose
at
might
give
him
some
faint
satisfaction
the
news
had
trickled
through
from
june
to
val
wife
from
her
to
val
from
val
to
his
mother
from
her
to
soames
that
the
fatal
house
at
robin
for
sale
and
irene
going
to
join
her
boy
out
in
british
columbia
or
some
such
place
for
one
wild
moment
the
thought
had
come
to
soames
should
i
buy
it
back
i
meant
it
for
my
no
sooner
come
than
gone
too
lugubrious
a
triumph
with
too
many
humiliating
memories
for
himself
and
fleur
she
would
never
live
there
after
what
had
happened
no
the
place
must
go
its
way
to
some
peer
or
profiteer
it
had
been
a
bone
of
contention
from
the
first
the
shell
of
the
feud
and
with
the
woman
gone
it
was
an
empty
shell
for
sale
or
to
with
his
mind
eye
he
could
see
that
board
raised
high
above
the
ivied
wall
which
he
had
built
he
passed
through
the
first
of
the
two
rooms
in
the
gallery
there
was
certainly
a
body
of
work
and
now
that
the
fellow
was
dead
it
did
not
seem
so
trivial
the
drawings
were
pleasing
enough
with
quite
a
sense
of
atmosphere
and
something
individual
in
the
brush
work
father
and
my
father
he
and
i
his
child
and
mine
thought
soames
so
it
had
gone
on
and
all
about
that
woman
softened
by
the
events
of
the
past
week
affected
by
the
melancholy
beauty
of
the
autumn
day
soames
came
nearer
than
he
had
ever
been
to
realisation
of
that
the
understanding
of
a
forsyte
the
body
of
beauty
has
a
spiritual
essence
uncapturable
save
by
a
devotion
which
thinks
not
of
self
after
all
he
was
near
that
truth
in
his
devotion
to
his
daughter
perhaps
that
made
him
understand
a
little
how
he
had
missed
the
prize
and
there
among
the
drawings
of
his
kinsman
who
had
attained
to
that
which
he
had
found
beyond
his
reach
he
thought
of
him
and
her
with
a
tolerance
which
surprised
him
but
he
did
not
buy
a
drawing
just
as
he
passed
the
seat
of
custom
on
his
return
to
the
outer
air
he
met
with
a
contingency
which
had
not
been
entirely
absent
from
his
mind
when
he
went
into
the
herself
coming
in
so
she
had
not
gone
yet
and
was
still
paying
farewell
visits
to
that
fellow
remains
he
subdued
the
little
involuntary
leap
of
his
subconsciousness
the
mechanical
reaction
of
his
senses
to
the
charm
of
this
woman
and
passed
her
with
averted
eyes
but
when
he
had
gone
by
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
help
looking
back
this
then
was
heat
and
stress
of
his
life
the
madness
and
the
longing
thereof
the
only
defeat
he
had
known
would
be
over
when
she
faded
from
his
view
this
time
even
such
memories
had
their
own
queer
aching
value
she
too
was
looking
back
suddenly
she
lifted
her
gloved
hand
her
lips
smiled
faintly
her
dark
eyes
seemed
to
speak
it
was
the
turn
of
soames
to
make
no
answer
to
that
smile
and
that
little
farewell
wave
he
went
out
into
the
fashionable
street
quivering
from
head
to
foot
he
knew
what
she
had
meant
to
say
now
that
i
am
going
for
ever
out
of
the
reach
of
you
and
me
i
wish
you
that
was
the
meaning
last
sign
of
that
terrible
morality
duty
common
aversion
from
him
who
had
owned
her
body
but
had
never
touched
her
spirit
or
her
heart
it
hurt
than
if
she
had
kept
her
mask
unmoved
her
hand
unlifted
three
days
later
in
that
october
soames
took
a
to
highgate
cemetery
and
mounted
through
its
white
forest
to
the
forsyte
vault
close
to
the
cedar
above
catacombs
and
columbaria
tall
ugly
and
individual
it
looked
like
an
apex
of
the
competitive
system
he
could
remember
a
discussion
wherein
swithin
had
advocated
the
addition
to
its
face
of
the
pheasant
proper
the
proposal
had
been
rejected
in
favour
of
a
wreath
in
stone
above
the
stark
words
the
family
vault
of
jolyon
forsyte
it
was
in
good
order
all
trace
of
the
recent
interment
had
been
removed
and
its
sober
grey
gloomed
reposefully
in
the
sunshine
the
whole
family
lay
there
now
except
old
jolyon
wife
who
had
gone
back
under
a
contract
to
her
own
family
vault
in
suffolk
old
jolyon
himself
lying
at
robin
hill
and
susan
hayman
cremated
so
that
none
knew
where
she
might
be
soames
gazed
at
it
with
needing
little
attention
and
this
was
important
for
he
was
well
aware
that
no
one
would
attend
to
it
when
he
himself
was
gone
and
he
would
have
to
be
looking
out
for
lodgings
soon
he
might
have
twenty
years
before
him
but
one
never
knew
twenty
years
without
an
aunt
or
uncle
with
a
wife
of
whom
one
had
better
not
know
anything
with
a
daughter
gone
from
home
his
mood
inclined
to
melancholy
and
retrospection
this
cemetery
was
full
they
people
with
extraordinary
names
buried
in
extraordinary
taste
still
they
had
a
fine
view
up
here
right
over
london
annette
had
once
given
him
a
story
to
read
by
that
frenchman
maupassant
most
lugubrious
concern
where
all
the
skeletons
emerged
from
their
graves
one
night
and
all
the
pious
inscriptions
on
the
stones
were
altered
to
descriptions
of
their
sins
not
a
true
story
at
all
he
did
know
about
the
french
but
there
was
not
much
real
harm
in
english
people
except
their
teeth
and
their
taste
which
was
certainly
deplorable
the
family
vault
of
jolyon
forsyte
a
lot
of
people
had
been
buried
here
since
lot
of
english
life
crumbled
to
mould
and
dust
the
boom
of
an
airplane
passing
under
the
clouds
caused
him
to
lift
his
eyes
the
deuce
of
a
lot
of
expansion
had
gone
on
but
it
all
came
back
to
a
a
name
and
a
date
on
a
tomb
and
he
thought
with
a
curious
pride
that
he
and
his
family
had
done
little
or
nothing
to
help
this
feverish
expansion
good
solid
middlemen
they
had
gone
to
work
with
dignity
to
manage
and
possess
superior
dosset
indeed
had
built
in
a
dreadful
and
jolyon
painted
in
a
doubtful
period
but
so
far
as
he
remembered
not
another
of
them
all
had
soiled
his
hands
by
creating
you
counted
val
dartie
and
his
collectors
solicitors
barristers
merchants
publishers
accountants
directors
land
agents
even
they
had
been
the
country
had
expanded
as
it
were
in
spite
of
them
they
had
checked
controlled
defended
and
taken
advantage
of
the
process
and
when
you
considered
how
superior
dosset
had
begun
life
with
next
to
nothing
and
his
lineal
descendants
already
owned
what
old
gradman
estimated
at
between
a
million
and
a
million
and
a
half
it
was
not
so
bad
and
yet
he
sometimes
felt
as
if
the
family
bolt
was
shot
their
possessive
instinct
dying
out
they
seemed
unable
to
make
fourth
generation
they
were
going
into
art
literature
farming
or
the
army
or
just
living
on
what
was
left
had
no
push
and
no
tenacity
they
would
die
out
if
they
take
care
soames
turned
from
the
vault
and
faced
toward
the
breeze
the
air
up
here
would
be
delicious
if
only
he
could
rid
his
nerves
of
the
feeling
that
mortality
was
in
it
he
gazed
restlessly
at
the
crosses
and
the
urns
the
angels
the
immortelles
the
flowers
gaudy
or
withering
and
suddenly
he
noticed
a
spot
which
seemed
so
different
from
anything
else
up
there
that
he
was
obliged
to
walk
the
few
necessary
yards
and
look
at
it
a
sober
corner
with
a
massive
cross
of
grey
granite
guarded
by
four
dark
the
spot
was
free
from
the
pressure
of
the
other
graves
having
a
little
garden
on
the
far
side
and
in
front
a
goldening
this
oasis
in
the
desert
of
conventional
graves
appealed
to
the
aesthetic
sense
of
soames
and
he
sat
down
there
in
the
sunshine
through
those
trembling
gold
birch
leaves
he
gazed
out
at
london
and
yielded
to
the
waves
of
memory
he
thought
of
irene
in
montpellier
square
when
her
hair
was
and
her
white
shoulders
the
prize
of
his
resistant
to
his
ownership
he
saw
bosinney
body
lying
in
that
white
mortuary
and
irene
sitting
on
the
sofa
looking
at
space
with
the
eyes
of
a
dying
bird
again
he
thought
of
her
by
the
little
green
niobe
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
once
more
rejecting
him
his
fancy
took
him
on
beside
his
drifting
river
on
the
november
day
when
fleur
was
to
be
born
took
him
to
the
dead
leaves
floating
on
the
water
and
the
weed
for
ever
swaying
and
nosing
sinuous
blind
tethered
and
on
again
to
the
window
opened
to
the
cold
starry
night
above
hyde
park
with
his
father
lying
dead
his
fancy
darted
to
that
picture
of
the
future
town
to
that
boy
and
fleur
first
meeting
to
the
bluish
trail
of
prosper
profond
cigar
and
fleur
in
the
window
pointing
down
to
where
the
fellow
prowled
to
the
sight
of
irene
and
that
dead
fellow
sitting
side
by
side
in
the
stand
at
lord
to
her
and
that
boy
at
robin
hill
to
the
sofa
where
fleur
lay
crushed
up
in
the
corner
to
her
lips
pressed
into
his
cheek
and
her
farewell
and
suddenly
he
saw
again
irene
hand
waving
its
last
gesture
of
release
he
sat
there
a
long
time
dreaming
his
career
faithful
to
the
scut
of
his
possessive
instinct
warming
himself
even
with
its
failures
to
let
forsyte
age
and
way
of
life
when
a
man
owned
his
soul
his
investments
and
his
woman
without
check
or
question
and
now
the
state
had
or
would
have
his
investments
his
woman
had
herself
and
god
knew
who
had
his
soul
to
let
sane
and
simple
creed
the
waters
of
change
were
foaming
in
carrying
the
promise
of
new
forms
only
when
their
destructive
flood
should
have
passed
its
full
he
sat
there
subconscious
of
them
but
with
his
thoughts
resolutely
set
on
the
a
man
might
ride
into
a
wild
night
with
his
face
to
the
tail
of
his
galloping
horse
athwart
the
victorian
dykes
the
waters
were
rolling
on
property
manners
and
morals
on
melody
and
the
old
forms
of
bringing
to
his
mouth
a
salt
taste
as
of
blood
lapping
to
the
foot
of
this
highgate
hill
where
victorianism
lay
buried
and
sitting
there
high
up
on
its
most
individual
spot
a
figure
of
their
restless
sounds
instinctively
he
would
not
fight
was
in
him
too
much
primeval
wisdom
of
man
the
possessive
animal
they
would
quiet
down
when
they
had
fulfilled
their
tidal
fever
of
dispossessing
and
destroying
when
the
creations
and
the
properties
of
others
were
sufficiently
broken
and
would
lapse
and
ebb
and
fresh
forms
would
rise
based
on
an
instinct
older
than
the
fever
of
instinct
of
home
je
fiche
said
prosper
profond
soames
did
not
say
je
fiche
was
french
and
the
fellow
was
a
thorn
in
his
deep
down
he
knew
that
change
was
only
the
interval
of
death
between
two
forms
of
life
destruction
necessary
to
make
room
for
fresher
property
what
though
the
board
was
up
and
cosiness
to
let
one
would
come
along
and
take
it
again
some
day
and
only
one
thing
really
troubled
him
sitting
melancholy
craving
in
his
the
sun
was
like
enchantment
on
his
face
and
on
the
clouds
and
on
the
golden
birch
leaves
and
the
wind
rustle
was
so
gentle
and
the
yewtree
green
so
dark
and
the
sickle
of
a
moon
pale
in
the
sky
he
might
wish
and
wish
and
never
get
beauty
and
the
loving
in
the
world
