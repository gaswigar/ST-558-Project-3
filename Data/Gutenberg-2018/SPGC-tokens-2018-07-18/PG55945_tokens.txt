bertha
will
be
back
in
a
moment
beatrice
down
again
in
the
richard
beside
the
richard
i
had
begun
to
think
you
would
never
come
back
it
is
twelve
days
since
you
were
here
beatrice
i
thought
of
that
too
but
i
have
come
richard
have
you
thought
over
what
i
told
you
when
you
were
here
last
beatrice
very
much
richard
you
must
have
known
it
before
did
you
does
not
do
you
blame
me
beatrice
no
richard
do
you
think
i
have
acted
towards
no
or
towards
anyone
beatrice
at
him
with
a
sad
puzzled
i
have
asked
myself
that
question
richard
and
the
answer
beatrice
i
could
not
answer
it
richard
if
i
were
a
painter
and
told
you
i
had
a
book
of
sketches
of
you
you
would
not
think
it
so
strange
would
you
beatrice
it
is
not
quite
the
same
case
is
it
richard
not
quite
i
told
you
also
that
i
would
not
show
you
what
i
had
written
unless
you
asked
to
see
it
well
beatrice
i
will
not
ask
you
richard
forward
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
hands
would
you
like
to
see
it
beatrice
very
much
richard
because
it
is
about
yourself
beatrice
yes
but
not
only
that
richard
because
it
is
written
by
me
yes
even
if
what
you
would
find
there
is
sometimes
cruel
beatrice
that
is
part
of
your
mind
too
richard
then
it
is
my
mind
that
attracts
you
is
that
it
beatrice
glances
at
him
for
an
why
do
you
think
i
come
here
richard
why
many
reasons
to
give
archie
lessons
we
have
known
one
another
so
many
years
from
childhood
robert
you
and
t
we
you
have
always
been
interested
in
me
before
i
went
away
and
while
i
was
away
then
our
letters
to
each
other
about
my
book
now
it
is
published
i
am
here
again
perhaps
you
feel
that
some
new
thing
is
gathering
in
my
brain
perhaps
you
feel
that
you
should
know
it
is
that
the
reason
beatrice
no
richard
why
then
beatrice
otherwise
i
could
not
see
you
looks
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
turns
aside
richard
a
pause
repeats
otherwise
you
could
not
see
me
beatrice
i
had
better
go
they
are
not
coming
back
mr
rowan
i
must
go
richard
his
but
you
are
running
away
remain
tell
me
what
your
words
mean
are
you
afraid
of
me
beatrice
back
afraid
no
richard
have
you
confidence
in
me
do
you
feel
that
you
know
me
beatrice
it
is
hard
to
know
anyone
but
oneself
richard
hard
to
know
me
i
sent
you
from
rome
the
chapters
of
my
book
as
i
wrote
them
and
letters
for
nine
long
years
well
eight
years
beatrice
yes
it
was
nearly
a
year
before
your
first
letter
came
richard
it
was
answered
at
once
by
you
and
from
that
on
you
have
watched
me
in
my
struggle
his
hands
tell
me
miss
justice
did
you
feel
that
what
you
read
was
written
for
your
eyes
or
that
you
inspired
me
beatrice
her
i
need
not
answer
that
question
richard
what
then
beatrice
silent
for
a
i
can
not
say
it
you
yourself
must
ask
me
mr
rowan
richard
some
then
that
i
expressed
in
those
chapters
and
letters
and
in
my
character
and
life
as
well
something
in
your
soul
which
you
could
or
scorn
beatrice
could
not
richard
towards
could
not
because
you
dared
not
is
that
why
beatrice
her
yes
richard
on
account
of
others
or
for
want
of
beatrice
courage
richard
and
so
you
have
followed
me
with
pride
and
scorn
also
in
your
heart
beatrice
and
loneliness
leans
her
head
on
her
hand
averting
her
face
richard
rises
and
walks
slowly
to
the
window
on
the
left
he
looks
out
for
some
moments
and
then
returns
towards
her
crosses
to
the
lounge
and
sits
down
near
richard
do
you
love
him
still
beatrice
i
do
not
even
know
richard
it
was
that
that
made
me
so
reserved
with
though
i
felt
your
interest
in
me
even
though
i
felt
that
i
too
was
something
in
your
life
beatrice
you
were
richard
yet
that
separated
me
from
you
i
was
a
third
person
i
felt
your
names
were
always
spoken
together
robert
and
beatrice
as
long
as
i
can
remember
it
seemed
to
me
to
everyone
beatrice
we
are
first
cousins
it
is
not
strange
that
we
were
often
together
richard
he
told
me
of
your
secret
engagement
with
him
he
had
no
secrets
from
me
i
suppose
you
know
that
beatrice
what
so
long
ago
i
was
a
child
richard
a
child
are
you
sure
it
was
in
the
garden
of
his
mother
s
house
no
points
towards
the
over
there
you
plighted
your
troth
as
they
say
with
a
kiss
and
you
gave
him
your
garter
is
it
allowed
to
mention
that
beatrice
some
if
you
think
it
worthy
of
mention
richard
i
think
you
have
not
forgotten
it
his
hands
i
do
not
understand
it
i
thought
too
that
after
i
had
gone
did
my
going
make
you
suffer
beatrice
i
always
knew
you
would
go
some
day
i
did
not
suffer
only
i
was
changed
richard
towards
him
beatrice
everything
was
changed
his
life
his
mind
even
seemed
to
change
after
that
richard
yes
i
saw
that
you
had
changed
when
i
received
your
first
letter
after
a
year
after
your
illness
too
you
even
said
so
in
your
letter
beatrice
it
brought
me
near
to
death
it
made
me
see
things
differently
richard
and
so
a
coldness
began
between
you
little
by
little
is
that
it
beatrice
closing
her
no
not
at
once
i
saw
in
him
a
pale
reflection
of
you
then
that
too
faded
of
what
good
is
it
to
talk
now
richard
a
repressed
but
what
is
this
that
seems
to
hang
over
you
it
can
not
be
so
tragic
beatrice
o
not
in
the
least
tragic
i
shall
become
gradually
better
they
tell
me
as
i
grow
older
as
i
did
not
die
then
they
tell
me
i
shall
probably
live
i
am
given
life
and
health
i
can
not
use
them
and
i
am
convalescent
richard
does
nothing
then
in
life
give
you
peace
surely
it
exists
for
you
somewhere
beatrice
if
there
were
convents
in
our
religion
perhaps
there
at
least
i
think
so
at
times
richard
his
no
miss
justice
not
even
there
you
could
not
give
yourself
freely
and
wholly
beatrice
at
i
would
try
richard
you
would
try
yes
you
were
drawn
to
him
as
your
mind
was
drawn
towards
mine
you
held
back
from
him
from
me
too
in
a
different
way
you
can
not
give
yourself
freely
and
wholly
beatrice
her
hands
it
is
a
terribly
hard
thing
to
do
mr
give
oneself
freely
and
be
happy
richard
but
do
you
feel
that
happiness
is
the
best
the
highest
that
we
can
know
beatrice
i
wish
i
could
feel
it
richard
back
his
hands
locked
together
behind
his
o
if
you
knew
how
i
am
suffering
at
this
moment
for
your
case
too
but
suffering
most
of
all
for
my
own
bitter
and
how
i
pray
that
i
may
be
granted
again
my
dead
mother
s
hardness
of
heart
for
some
help
within
me
or
without
i
must
find
and
find
it
i
will
rises
looks
at
him
intently
and
walks
away
toward
the
garden
door
she
turns
with
indecision
looks
again
at
him
and
coming
back
leans
over
the
beatrice
did
she
send
for
you
before
she
died
mr
rowan
richard
in
who
beatrice
your
mother
richard
himself
looks
keenly
at
her
for
a
so
that
too
was
said
of
me
here
by
my
she
sent
for
me
before
she
died
and
that
i
did
not
go
beatrice
yes
richard
she
did
not
she
died
alone
not
having
forgiven
me
and
fortified
by
the
rites
of
holy
church
beatrice
mr
rowan
why
did
you
speak
to
me
in
such
a
way
richard
and
walks
nervously
to
and
and
what
i
suffer
at
this
moment
you
will
say
is
my
punishment
beatrice
did
she
write
to
you
i
mean
before
richard
yes
a
letter
of
warning
bidding
me
break
with
the
past
and
remember
her
last
words
to
me
beatrice
and
does
death
not
move
you
mr
rowan
it
is
an
end
everything
else
is
so
uncertain
richard
while
she
lived
she
turned
aside
from
me
and
from
mine
that
is
certain
beatrice
from
you
and
from
richard
from
bertha
and
from
me
and
from
our
child
and
so
i
waited
for
the
end
as
you
say
and
it
came
beatrice
her
face
with
her
o
no
surely
no
richard
how
can
my
words
hurt
her
poor
body
that
rots
in
the
grave
do
you
think
i
do
not
pity
her
cold
blighted
love
for
me
i
fought
against
her
spirit
while
she
lived
to
the
bitter
end
presses
his
hand
to
his
it
fights
against
me
here
beatrice
o
do
not
speak
like
that
richard
she
drove
me
away
on
account
of
her
i
lived
years
in
exile
and
poverty
too
or
near
it
i
never
accepted
the
doles
she
sent
me
through
the
bank
i
waited
too
not
for
her
death
but
for
some
understanding
of
me
her
own
son
her
own
flesh
and
blood
that
never
came
beatrice
not
even
after
archie
richard
my
son
you
think
a
child
of
sin
and
shame
are
you
serious
raises
her
face
and
looks
at
there
were
tongues
here
ready
to
tell
her
all
to
embitter
her
withering
mind
still
more
against
me
and
bertha
and
our
godless
nameless
child
out
his
hands
to
can
you
not
hear
her
mocking
me
while
i
speak
you
must
know
the
voice
surely
the
voice
that
called
you
black
the
pervert
s
daughter
sudden
in
any
case
a
remarkable
woman
beatrice
at
least
you
are
free
now
richard
yes
she
could
not
alter
the
terms
of
my
father
s
will
nor
live
for
ever
beatrice
joined
they
are
both
gone
now
mr
rowan
they
both
loved
you
believe
me
their
last
thoughts
were
of
you
richard
touches
her
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
points
to
the
crayon
drawing
on
the
do
you
see
him
there
smiling
and
handsome
his
last
thoughts
i
remember
the
night
he
died
pauses
for
an
instant
and
then
goes
on
i
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
he
called
me
to
his
bedside
he
knew
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
theatre
to
hear
he
told
my
mother
to
give
me
a
shilling
i
kissed
him
and
went
when
i
came
home
he
was
dead
those
were
his
last
thoughts
as
far
as
i
know
beatrice
the
hardness
of
heart
you
prayed
for
breaks
richard
that
is
my
last
memory
of
him
is
there
not
something
sweet
and
noble
in
it
beatrice
mr
rowan
something
is
on
your
mind
to
make
you
speak
like
this
something
has
changed
you
since
you
came
back
three
months
ago

approaching
a
difficult
moment

not

here
richard
a
slight
have
you
any
news
robert
a
different
yes
i
want
to
speak
to
you
seriously
today
may
be
an
important
day
for
rather
tonight
i
saw
the
vicechancellor
this
morning
he
has
the
highest
opinion
of
you
richard
he
has
read
your
book
he
said
richard
did
he
buy
it
or
borrow
it
robert
bought
it
i
hope
richard
i
shall
smoke
a
cigarette
thirtyseven
copies
have
now
been
sold
in
dublin
takes
a
cigarette
from
the
box
on
the
table
and
lights
robert
well
the
matter
is
closed
for
the
present
you
have
your
iron
mask
on
today
richard
let
me
hear
the
rest
robert
richard
you
are
too
suspicious
it
is
a
defect
in
you
he
assured
me
he
has
the
highest
possible
opinion
of
you
as
everyone
has
you
are
the
man
for
the
post
he
says
in
fact
he
told
me
that
if
your
name
goes
forward
he
will
work
might
and
main
for
you
with
the
senate
and
i
will
do
my
part
of
course
in
the
press
and
privately
i
regard
it
as
a
public
duty
the
chair
of
romance
literature
is
yours
by
right
as
a
scholar
as
a
literary
personality
richard
the
conditions
robert
conditions
you
mean
about
the
future
richard
i
mean
about
the
past
robert
that
episode
in
your
past
is
forgotten
an
act
of
impulse
we
are
all
impulsive
richard
fixedly
at
you
called
it
an
act
of
folly
years
ago
you
told
me
i
was
hanging
a
weight
about
my
neck
robert
i
was
wrong
here
is
how
the
matter
stands
richard
everyone
knows
that
you
ran
away
years
ago
with
a
young
girl
how
shall
i
put
it
with
a
young
girl
not
exactly
your
equal
excuse
me
richard
that
is
not
my
opinion
nor
my
language
i
am
simply
using
the
language
of
people
whose
opinions
i
don
t
share
richard
writing
one
of
your
leading
articles
in
fact
robert
put
it
so
well
it
made
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
a
mysterious
disappearance
my
name
was
involved
too
as
best
man
let
us
say
on
that
famous
occasion
of
course
they
think
i
acted
from
a
mistaken
sense
of
friendship
well
all
that
is
known
some
but
what
happened
afterwards
is
not
known
richard
no
robert
of
course
it
is
your
affair
richard
however
you
are
not
so
young
now
as
you
were
then
the
expression
is
quite
in
the
style
of
my
leading
articles
isn
t
it
richard
do
you
or
do
you
not
want
me
to
give
the
lie
to
my
past
life
robert
i
am
thinking
of
your
future
i
understand
your
pride
and
your
sense
of
liberty
i
understand
their
point
of
view
also
however
there
is
a
way
out
it
is
simply
this
refrain
from
contradicting
any
rumours
you
may
hear
concerning
what
happened
or
did
not
happen
after
you
went
away
leave
the
rest
to
me
richard
you
will
set
these
rumours
afloat
robert
i
will
god
help
me
richard
for
the
sake
of
social
conventions
robert
for
the
sake
of
something
else
friendship
our
lifelong
friendship
richard
thanks
robert
and
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
richard
and
yes
do
please
robert
not
only
for
your
sake
also
for
the
sake
present
partner
in
life
richard
i
see
crushes
his
cigarette
softly
on
the
ashtray
and
then
leans
forward
rubbing
his
hands
richard
why
for
her
sake
robert
leans
forward
richard
have
you
been
quite
fair
to
her
it
was
her
own
free
choice
you
will
say
but
was
she
really
free
to
choose
she
was
a
mere
girl
she
accepted
all
that
you
proposed
richard
that
is
your
way
of
saying
that
she
proposed
what
i
would
not
accept
robert
i
remember
and
she
went
away
with
you
but
was
it
of
her
own
free
choice
answer
me
frankly
richard
to
him
i
played
for
her
against
all
that
you
say
or
can
say
and
i
won
robert
yes
you
won
richard
excuse
me
for
forgetting
will
you
have
some
whisky
robert
all
things
come
to
those
who
wait
goes
to
the
sideboard
and
brings
a
small
tray
with
the
decanter
and
glasses
to
the
table
where
he
sets
it
richard
down
again
leaning
back
on
the
will
you
please
help
yourself
robert
and
you
steadfast
shakes
his
lord
when
i
think
of
our
wild
nights
long
by
the
hour
plans
carouses
revelry
richard
in
our
house
robert
it
is
mine
now
i
have
kept
it
ever
since
though
i
don
t
go
there
often
whenever
you
like
to
come
let
me
know
you
must
come
some
night
it
will
be
old
times
again
lifts
his
glass
and
richard
it
was
not
only
a
house
of
revelry
it
was
to
be
the
hearth
of
a
new
life
and
in
that
name
all
our
sins
were
committed
robert
sins
drinking
and
blasphemy
by
me
and
drinking
and
heresy
much
worse
points
by
those
the
sins
you
mean
richard
and
some
others
robert
you
mean
the
women
i
have
no
remorse
of
conscience
maybe
you
have
we
had
two
keys
on
those
occasions
have
you
richard
for
you
it
was
all
quite
natural
robert
for
me
it
is
quite
natural
to
kiss
a
woman
whom
i
like
why
not
she
is
beautiful
for
me
richard
with
the
lounge
do
you
kiss
everything
that
is
beautiful
for
you
robert
it
can
be
kissed
takes
up
a
flat
stone
which
lies
on
the
this
stone
for
instance
it
is
so
cool
so
polished
so
delicate
like
a
woman
s
temple
it
is
silent
it
suffers
our
passion
and
it
is
beautiful
places
it
against
his
and
so
i
kiss
it
because
it
is
beautiful
and
what
is
a
woman
a
work
of
nature
too
like
a
stone
or
a
flower
or
a
bird
a
kiss
is
an
act
of
homage
richard
it
is
an
act
of
union
between
man
and
woman
even
if
we
are
often
led
to
desire
through
the
sense
of
beauty
can
you
say
that
the
beautiful
is
what
we
desire
robert
the
stone
to
his
you
will
give
me
a
headache
if
you
make
me
think
today
i
can
not
think
today
i
feel
too
natural
too
common
after
all
what
is
most
attractive
in
even
the
most
beautiful
woman
richard
what
robert
not
those
qualities
which
she
has
and
other
women
have
not
but
the
qualities
which
she
has
in
common
with
them
i
mean
the
commonest
over
the
stone
he
presses
the
other
side
to
his
i
mean
how
her
body
develops
heat
when
it
is
pressed
the
movement
of
her
blood
how
quickly
she
changes
by
digestion
what
she
eats
shall
be
nameless
i
am
very
common
today
perhaps
that
idea
never
struck
you
richard
many
ideas
strike
a
man
who
has
lived
nine
years
with
a
woman
robert
yes
i
suppose
they
do
this
beautiful
cool
stone
does
me
good
is
it
a
paperweight
or
a
cure
for
headache
richard
bertha
brought
it
home
one
day
from
the
strand
she
too
says
that
it
is
beautiful
robert
down
the
stone
she
is
right
raises
his
glass
and
drinks
a
richard
is
that
all
you
wanted
to
say
to
me
robert
there
is
something
else
the
vicechancellor
sends
you
through
me
an
invitation
for
dinner
at
his
house
you
know
where
he
lives
i
thought
you
might
have
forgotten
strictly
private
of
course
he
wants
to
meet
you
again
and
sends
you
a
very
warm
invitation
richard
for
what
hour
robert
eight
but
like
yourself
he
is
free
and
easy
about
time
now
richard
you
must
go
there
that
is
all
i
feel
tonight
will
be
the
turningpoint
in
your
life
you
will
live
here
and
work
here
and
think
here
and
be
honoured
our
people
richard
i
can
almost
see
two
envoys
starting
for
the
united
states
to
collect
funds
for
my
statue
a
hundred
years
hence
robert
once
i
made
a
little
epigram
about
statues
all
statues
are
of
two
kinds
folds
his
arms
across
his
the
statue
which
says
shall
i
get
down
and
the
other
kind
unfolds
his
arms
and
extends
his
right
arm
averting
his
the
statue
which
says
my
time
the
dunghill
was
so
richard
the
second
one
for
me
please
robert
will
you
give
me
one
of
those
long
cigars
of
yours
selects
a
virginia
cigar
from
the
box
on
the
table
and
hands
it
to
him
with
the
straw
drawn
robert
these
cigars
europeanize
me
if
ireland
is
to
become
a
new
ireland
she
must
first
become
european
and
that
is
what
you
are
here
for
richard
some
day
we
shall
have
to
choose
between
england
and
europe
i
am
a
descendant
of
the
dark
foreigners
that
is
why
i
like
to
be
here
i
may
be
childish
but
where
else
in
dublin
can
i
get
a
bandit
cigar
like
this
or
a
cup
of
black
coffee
the
man
who
drinks
black
coffee
is
going
to
conquer
ireland
and
now
i
will
take
just
a
half
measure
of
that
whisky
richard
to
show
you
there
is
no
ill
feeling
richard
help
yourself
robert
thanks
drinks
and
goes
on
as
then
you
yourself
the
way
you
loll
on
that
lounge
then
your
boy
s
voice
and
herself
do
you
allow
me
to
call
her
that
richard
i
mean
as
an
old
friend
of
both
of
you
richard
o
why
not
robert
you
have
that
fierce
indignation
which
lacerated
the
heart
of
swift
you
have
fallen
from
a
higher
world
richard
and
you
are
filled
with
fierce
indignation
when
you
find
that
life
is
cowardly
and
ignoble
while
i
shall
i
tell
you
richard
by
all
means
robert
i
have
come
up
from
a
lower
world
and
i
am
filled
with
astonishment
when
i
find
that
people
have
any
redeeming
virtue
at
all
richard
up
suddenly
and
leans
his
elbows
on
the
you
are
my
friend

robert
i
fought
for
you
all
the
time
you
were

fought
to
bring
you
back
i
fought
to
keep
your
place
for
you
here
i
will
fight
for
you
still

i
have
faith
in
you
the
faith
of
a
disciple
in
his
master
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
give
me
a
match
richard
and
offers
him
a
there
is
a
faith
still
stranger
than
the
faith
of
the
disciple
in
his
master
robert
and
that
is
richard
the
faith
of
a
master
in
the
disciple

all
richard
eh
bertha
the
work
of
a
devil
richard
he
bertha
on
no
you
the
work
of
a
devil
to
turn
him
against
me
as
you
tried
to
turn
my
own
child
against
me
only
you
did
not
succeed
richard
how
in
god
s
name
how
bertha
yes
yes
what
i
say
everyone
saw
it
whenever
i
tried
to
correct
him
for
the
least
thing
you
went
on
with
your
folly
speaking
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
grownup
man
ruining
the
poor
child
or
trying
to
then
of
course
i
was
the
cruel
mother
and
only
you
loved
him
growing
but
you
did
not
turn
him
against
his
own
mother
because
why
because
the
child
has
too
much
nature
in
him
richard
i
never
tried
to
do
such
a
thing
bertha
you
know
i
can
not
be
severe
with
a
child
bertha
because
you
never
loved
your
own
mother
a
mother
is
always
a
mother
no
matter
what
i
never
heard
of
any
human
being
that
did
not
love
the
mother
that
brought
him
into
the
world
except
you
richard
her
bertha
do
not
say
things
you
will
be
sorry
for
are
you
not
glad
my
son
is
fond
of
me
bertha
who
taught
him
to
be
who
taught
him
to
run
to
meet
you
who
told
him
you
would
bring
him
home
toys
when
you
were
out
on
your
rambles
in
the
rain
forgetting
all
about
me
i
did
i
taught
him
to
love
you
richard
yes
dear
i
know
it
was
you
bertha
and
then
you
try
to
turn
everyone
against
me
all
is
to
be
for
you
i
am
to
appear
false
and
cruel
to
everyone
except
to
you
because
you
take
advantage
of
my
simplicity
as
you
first
time
richard
and
you
have
the
courage
to
say
that
to
me
bertha
yes
i
have
both
then
and
now
because
i
am
simple
you
think
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
me
follow
him
now
call
him
names
make
him
be
humble
before
you
and
make
him
despise
me
follow
him
richard
you
forget
that
i
have
allowed
you
complete
allow
you
it
still
bertha
liberty
richard
yes
complete
but
he
must
know
that
i
know
i
will
speak
to
him
quietly
bertha
believe
me
dear
it
is
not
jealousy
you
have
complete
liberty
to
do
as
you
and
he
but
not
in
this
way
he
will
not
despise
you
you
don
t
wish
to
deceive
me
or
to
pretend
to
deceive
him
do
you
bertha
no
i
do
not
full
at
which
of
us
two
is
the
deceiver
richard
of
us
you
and
me
bertha
a
calm
decided
i
know
why
you
have
allowed
me
what
you
call
complete
liberty
richard
why
bertha
to
have
complete
liberty
girl
richard
but
good
god
you
knew
about
that
this
long
time
i
never
hid
it
bertha
you
did
i
thought
it
was
a
kind
of
friendship
between
we
came
back
and
then
i
saw
richard
so
it
is
bertha
bertha
her
no
no
it
is
much
more
and
that
is
why
you
give
me
complete
liberty
all
those
things
you
sit
up
at
night
to
write
about
to
the
in
her
you
call
that
friendship
richard
believe
me
bertha
dear
believe
me
as
i
believe
you
bertha
an
impulsive
my
god
i
feel
it
i
know
it
what
else
is
between
you
but
love
richard
you
are
trying
to
put
that
idea
into
my
head
but
i
warn
you
that
i
don
t
take
my
ideas
from
other
people
bertha
it
is
it
is
and
that
is
why
you
allow
him
to
go
on
of
course
it
doesn
t
affect
you
you
love
her
richard
love
out
his
hands
with
a
sigh
and
moves
away
from
i
can
not
argue
with
you
bertha
you
can
t
because
i
am
right
him
a
few
what
would
anyone
say
richard
to
do
you
think
i
care
bertha
but
i
care
what
would
he
say
if
he
knew
you
who
talk
so
much
of
the
high
kind
of
feeling
you
have
for
me
expressing
yourself
in
that
way
to
another
woman
if
he
did
it
or
other
men
i
could
understand
because
they
are
false
pretenders
but
you
dick
why
do
you
not
tell
him
then
richard
you
can
if
you
like
bertha
i
will
certainly
i
will
richard
he
will
explain
it
to
you
bertha
he
doesn
t
say
one
thing
and
do
another
he
is
honest
in
his
own
way
richard
one
of
the
roses
and
throws
it
at
her
he
is
indeed
the
soul
of
honour
bertha
you
may
make
fun
of
him
as
much
as
you
like
i
understand
more
than
you
think
about
that
business
and
so
will
he
writing
those
long
letters
to
her
for
years
and
she
to
you
for
years
but
since
i
came
back
i
understand
richard
you
do
not
nor
would
he
bertha
of
course
neither
he
nor
i
can
understand
it
only
she
can
because
it
is
such
a
deep
thing
richard
neither
he
nor
she
either
not
one
of
you
bertha
great
she
will
she
will
understand
it
the
diseased
woman
turns
away
and
walks
over
to
the
little
table
on
the
right
richard
restrains
a
sudden
gesture
a
short
richard
bertha
take
care
of
uttering
words
like
that
bertha
i
don
t
mean
any
harm
i
feel
for
her
more
than
you
can
because
i
am
a
woman
i
do
sincerely
but
what
i
say
is
true
richard
is
it
generous
think
bertha
towards
the
it
is
she
who
is
not
generous
remember
now
what
i
say
richard
what
bertha
nearer
in
a
calmer
you
have
given
that
woman
very
much
dick
and
she
may
be
worthy
of
it
and
she
may
understand
it
all
too
i
know
she
is
that
kind
richard
do
you
believe
that
bertha
i
do
but
i
believe
you
will
get
very
little
from
her
in
from
any
of
her
clan
remember
my
words
dick
because
she
is
not
generous

are
not
generous

how
artistic
i
have
become
points
to
the
the
piano
is
an
addition
since
your
time
i
was
just
strumming
out
wagner
when
you
came
killing
time
you
see
i
am
ready
for
the
fray
i
was
just
wondering
how
you
and
the
vicechancellor
were
getting
on
together
exaggerated
but
are
you
going
in
that
suit
o
well
it
doesn
t
make
much
odds
i
suppose
but
how
goes
the
time
takes
out
his
twenty
past
eight
already
i
declare
richard
have
you
an
appointment
robert
suspicious
to
the
last
richard
then
i
may
sit
down
robert
of
course
of
course
both
sit
for
a
few
minutes
anyhow
then
we
can
both
go
on
together
we
are
not
bound
for
time
between
eight
and
nine
he
said
didn
t
he
what
time
is
it
i
wonder
about
to
look
again
at
his
watch
then
twenty
past
eight
yes
richard
your
appointment
also
was
for
the
same
hour
here
robert
what
appointment
richard
with
bertha
robert
at
are
you
mad
richard
are
you
robert
a
long
who
told
you
richard
she
short
robert
a
low
yes
i
must
have
been
mad
listen
to
me
richard
it
is
a
great
relief
to
me
that
you
have
greatest
relief
i
assure
you
that
ever
since
this
afternoon
i
have
thought
and
thought
how
i
could
break
it
off
without
seeming
a
fool
a
great
relief
i
even
intended
to
send
word
a
letter
a
few
lines
but
then
it
was
too
late
his
hand
over
his
let
me
speak
frankly
with
you
let
me
tell
you
everything
richard
i
know
everything
i
have
known
for
some
time
robert
since
when
richard
since
it
began
between
you
and
her
robert
yes
i
was
mad
but
it
was
merely
lightheadedness
i
admit
that
to
have
asked
her
here
this
evening
was
a
mistake
i
can
explain
everything
to
you
and
i
will
truly
richard
explain
to
me
what
is
the
word
you
longed
and
never
dared
to
say
to
her
if
you
can
or
will
robert
down
then
raises
his
yes
i
will
i
admire
very
much
the
personality
of
your
of
your
wife
that
is
the
word
i
can
say
it
it
is
no
secret
richard
then
why
did
you
wish
to
keep
secret
your
wooing
robert
wooing
richard
your
advances
to
her
little
by
little
day
after
day
looks
whispers
a
nervous
movement
of
the
wooing
robert
but
how
do
you
know
all
this
richard
she
told
me
robert
this
afternoon
richard
no
time
after
time
as
it
happened
robert
you
knew
from
her
you
were
watching
us
all
the
time
richard
i
was
watching
you
robert
i
mean
watching
me
and
you
never
spoke
you
had
only
to
speak
a
save
me
from
myself
you
were
trying
me
his
hand
again
over
his
it
was
a
terrible
trial
now
also
well
it
is
past
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
me
for
all
my
life
you
hate
me
now
for
what
i
have
done
and
for
richard
looking
at
have
i
said
that
i
hate
you
robert
do
you
not
you
must
richard
even
if
bertha
had
not
told
me
i
should
have
known
did
you
not
see
that
when
i
came
in
this
afternoon
i
went
into
my
study
suddenly
for
a
moment
robert
you
did
i
remember
richard
to
give
you
time
to
recover
yourself
it
made
me
sad
to
see
your
eyes
and
the
roses
too
i
can
not
say
why
a
great
mass
of
overblown
roses
robert
i
thought
i
had
to
give
them
was
that
strange
at
richard
with
a
tortured
too
many
perhaps
or
too
old
or
common
richard
that
was
why
i
did
not
hate
you
the
whole
thing
made
me
sad
all
at
once
robert
and
this
is
real
it
is
us
stares
before
him
for
some
moments
in
silence
as
if
dazed
then
without
turning
his
head
robert
and
she
too
was
trying
me
making
an
experiment
with
me
for
your
sake
richard
you
know
women
better
than
i
do
she
says
she
felt
pity
for
you
robert
pitied
me
because
i
am
no
longer
an
ideal
lover
like
my
roses
common
old
richard
like
all
men
you
have
a
foolish
wandering
heart
robert
well
you
spoke
at
last
you
chose
the
right
moment
richard
robert
not
like
this
for
us
two
no
years
a
whole
life
of
friendship
think
a
moment
since
childhood
boyhood
no
no
not
in
such
a
night
about
and
in
such
a
place
no
robert
that
is
not
for
people
like
us
robert
what
a
lesson
richard
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
relief
it
is
to
me
that
you
have
the
danger
is
passed
yes
yes
because
there
was
some
danger
for
you
too
if
you
think
was
there
not
richard
what
danger
robert
the
same
i
don
t
know
i
mean
if
you
had
not
spoken
if
you
had
watched
and
waited
on
until
richard
until
robert
until
i
had
come
to
like
her
more
and
more
because
i
can
assure
you
it
is
only
a
lightheaded
idea
of
mine
to
like
her
deeply
to
love
her
would
you
have
spoken
to
me
then
as
you
have
just
now
is
silent
robert
goes
on
more
it
would
have
been
different
would
it
not
for
then
it
might
have
been
too
late
while
it
is
not
too
late
now
what
could
i
have
said
then
i
could
have
said
only
you
are
my
friend
my
dear
good
friend
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
love
her
a
sudden
fervent
i
love
her
and
i
will
take
her
from
you
however
i
can
because
i
love
her
look
at
each
other
for
some
moments
in
richard
that
is
the
language
i
have
heard
often
and
never
believed
in
do
you
mean
by
stealth
or
by
violence
steal
you
could
not
in
my
house
because
the
doors
were
open
nor
take
by
violence
if
there
were
no
resistance
robert
you
forget
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffers
violence
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
a
woman
richard
go
on
robert
but
do
you
think
you
have
rights
over
her
heart
richard
none
robert
for
what
you
have
done
for
her
so
much
you
claim
nothing
richard
nothing
robert
a
pause
strikes
his
forehead
with
his
what
am
i
saying
or
what
am
i
thinking
i
wish
you
would
upbraid
me
curse
me
hate
me
as
i
deserve
you
love
this
woman
i
remember
all
you
told
me
long
ago
she
is
yours
your
work
and
that
is
why
i
too
was
drawn
to
her
you
are
so
strong
that
you
attract
me
even
through
her
richard
i
am
weak
robert
you
richard
you
are
the
incarnation
of
strength
richard
out
his
feel
those
hands
robert
his
yes
mine
are
stronger
but
i
meant
strength
of
another
kind
richard
i
think
you
would
try
to
take
her
by
violence
withdraws
his
hands
robert
those
are
moments
of
sheer
madness
when
we
feel
an
intense
passion
for
a
woman
we
see
nothing
we
think
of
nothing
only
to
possess
her
call
it
brutal
bestial
what
you
will
richard
little
i
am
afraid
that
that
longing
to
possess
a
woman
is
not
love
robert
no
man
ever
yet
lived
on
this
earth
who
did
not
long
to
mean
to
possess
in
the
woman
whom
he
loves
it
is
nature
s
law
richard
what
is
that
to
me
did
i
vote
it
robert
but
if
you
love
what
else
is
it
richard
to
wish
her
well
robert
but
the
passion
which
burns
us
night
and
day
to
possess
her
you
feel
it
as
i
do
and
it
is
not
what
you
said
now
richard
have
you
stops
for
an
have
you
the
luminous
certitude
that
yours
is
the
brain
in
contact
with
which
she
must
think
and
understand
and
that
yours
is
the
body
in
contact
with
which
her
body
must
feel
have
you
this
certitude
in
yourself
robert
have
you
richard
once
i
had
it
robert
a
certitude
as
luminous
as
that
of
my
own
an
illusion
as
luminous
robert
and
now
richard
if
you
had
it
and
i
could
feel
that
you
had
now
robert
what
would
you
do
richard
go
away
you
and
not
i
would
be
necessary
to
her
alone
as
i
was
before
i
met
her
robert
his
hands
a
nice
little
load
on
my
conscience
richard
you
met
my
son
when
you
came
to
my
house
this
afternoon
he
told
me
what
did
you
feel
robert
pleasure
richard
nothing
else
robert
nothing
else
unless
i
thought
of
two
things
at
the
same
time
i
am
like
that
if
my
best
friend
lay
in
his
coffin
and
his
face
had
a
comic
expression
i
should
smile
a
little
gesture
of
i
am
like
that
but
i
should
suffer
too
deeply
richard
you
spoke
of
conscience
did
he
seem
to
you
a
child
an
angel
robert
his
no
neither
an
angel
nor
an
two
things
by
the
way
for
which
i
have
very
little
sympathy
richard
never
then
never
even
with
her
tell
me
i
wish
to
know
robert
i
feel
in
my
heart
something
different
i
believe
that
on
the
last
day
if
it
ever
comes
when
we
are
all
assembled
together
that
the
almighty
will
speak
to
us
like
this
we
will
say
that
we
lived
chastely
with
one
other
creature
richard
lie
to
him
robert
or
that
we
tried
to
and
he
will
say
to
us
fools
who
told
you
that
you
were
to
give
yourselves
to
one
being
only
you
were
made
to
give
yourselves
to
many
freely
i
wrote
that
law
with
my
finger
on
your
hearts
richard
on
woman
s
heart
too
robert
yes
can
we
close
our
heart
against
an
affection
which
we
feel
deeply
should
we
close
it
should
she
richard
we
are
speaking
of
bodily
union
robert
affection
between
man
and
woman
must
come
to
that
we
think
too
much
of
it
because
our
minds
are
warped
for
us
today
it
is
of
no
more
consequence
than
any
other
form
of
a
kiss
richard
if
it
is
of
no
consequence
why
are
you
dissatisfied
till
you
reach
that
end
why
were
you
waiting
here
tonight
robert
passion
tends
to
go
as
far
as
it
can
but
you
may
believe
me
or
not
i
had
not
that
in
my
reach
that
end
richard
reach
it
if
you
can
i
will
use
no
arm
against
you
that
the
world
puts
in
my
hand
if
the
law
which
god
s
finger
has
written
on
our
hearts
is
the
law
you
say
i
too
am
god
s
creature
rises
and
paces
to
and
fro
some
moments
in
silence
then
he
goes
towards
the
porch
and
leans
against
the
jamb
robert
watches
robert
i
always
felt
it
in
myself
and
in
others
richard
yes
robert
a
vague
for
all
that
a
woman
too
has
the
right
to
try
with
many
men
until
she
finds
love
an
immoral
idea
is
it
not
i
wanted
to
write
a
book
about
it
i
began
it
richard
yes
robert
because
i
knew
a
woman
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
doing
out
that
idea
in
her
own
life
she
interested
me
very
much
richard
when
was
this
robert
o
not
lately
when
you
were
away
leaves
his
place
rather
abruptly
and
again
paces
to
and
robert
you
see
i
am
more
honest
than
you
thought
richard
i
wish
you
had
not
thought
of
her
she
was
or
is
robert
she
was
and
is
the
wife
of
a
stockbroker
richard
you
know
him
robert
intimately
sits
down
again
in
the
same
place
and
leans
forward
his
head
on
his
robert
his
chair
a
little
may
i
ask
you
a
question
richard
you
may
robert
some
has
it
never
happened
to
you
in
these
mean
when
you
were
away
from
her
perhaps
or
betray
her
with
another
betray
her
i
mean
not
in
love
carnally
i
mean
has
that
never
happened
richard
it
has
robert
and
what
did
you
do
richard
i
remember
the
first
time
i
came
home
it
was
night
my
house
was
silent
my
little
son
was
sleeping
in
his
cot
she
too
was
asleep
i
wakened
her
from
sleep
and
told
her
i
cried
beside
her
bed
and
i
pierced
her
heart
robert
o
richard
why
did
you
do
that
richard
betray
her
robert
no
but
tell
her
waken
her
from
sleep
to
tell
her
it
was
piercing
her
heart
richard
she
must
know
me
as
i
am
robert
but
that
is
not
you
as
you
are
a
moment
of
weakness
richard
in
and
i
was
feeding
the
flame
of
her
innocence
with
my
guilt
robert
o
don
t
talk
of
guilt
and
innocence
you
have
made
her
all
that
she
is
a
strange
and
wonderful
my
eyes
at
least
richard
or
i
have
killed
her
robert
killed
her
richard
the
virginity
of
her
soul
robert
well
lost
what
would
she
be
without
you
richard
i
tried
to
give
her
a
new
life
robert
and
you
have
a
new
and
rich
life
richard
is
it
worth
what
i
have
taken
from
girlhood
her
laughter
her
young
beauty
the
hopes
in
her
young
heart
robert
yes
well
worth
it
looks
at
richard
for
some
moments
in
if
you
had
neglected
her
lived
wildly
brought
her
away
so
far
only
to
make
her
suffer
stops
richard
raises
his
head
and
looks
at
richard
if
i
had
robert
you
know
there
were
rumours
here
of
your
life
wild
life
some
persons
who
knew
you
or
met
you
or
heard
of
you
in
rome
lying
rumours
richard
continue
robert
a
little
even
i
at
times
thought
of
her
as
a
victim
and
of
course
richard
i
felt
and
knew
all
the
time
that
you
were
a
man
of
great
something
more
than
talent
and
that
was
your
valid
one
in
my
eyes
richard
have
you
thought
that
it
is
perhaps
this
i
am
neglecting
her
clasps
his
hands
nervously
and
leans
across
toward
i
may
be
silent
still
and
she
may
yield
to
you
at
and
many
times
robert
back
at
my
dear
richard
my
dear
friend
i
swear
to
you
i
could
not
make
you
suffer
richard
you
may
then
know
in
soul
and
body
in
a
hundred
forms
and
ever
restlessly
what
some
old
theologian
duns
scotus
i
think
called
a
death
of
the
spirit
robert
a
death
no
its
affirmation
a
death
the
supreme
instant
of
life
from
which
all
coming
life
proceeds
the
eternal
law
of
nature
herself
richard
and
that
other
law
of
nature
as
you
call
it
change
how
will
it
be
when
you
turn
against
her
and
against
me
when
her
beauty
or
what
seems
so
to
you
now
wearies
you
and
my
affection
for
you
seems
false
and
odious
robert
that
will
never
be
never
richard
and
you
turn
even
against
yourself
for
having
known
me
or
trafficked
with
us
both
robert
it
will
never
be
like
that
richard
be
sure
of
that
richard
i
care
very
little
whether
it
is
or
not
because
there
is
something
i
fear
much
more
robert
his
you
fear
i
disbelieve
you
richard
since
we
were
boys
together
i
have
followed
your
mind
you
do
not
know
what
moral
fear
is
richard
his
hand
on
his
listen
she
is
dead
she
lies
on
my
bed
i
look
at
her
body
which
i
and
many
times
and
loved
too
and
wept
over
and
i
know
that
her
body
was
always
my
loyal
slave
to
me
to
me
only
she
gave
breaks
off
and
turns
aside
unable
to
robert
do
not
suffer
richard
there
is
no
need
she
is
loyal
to
you
body
and
soul
why
do
you
fear
richard
towards
him
almost
not
that
fear
but
that
i
will
reproach
myself
then
for
having
taken
all
for
myself
because
i
would
not
suffer
her
to
give
to
another
what
was
hers
and
not
mine
to
give
because
i
accepted
from
her
her
loyalty
and
made
her
life
poorer
in
love
that
is
my
fear
that
i
stand
between
her
and
any
moments
of
life
that
should
be
hers
between
her
and
you
between
her
and
anyone
between
her
and
anything
i
will
not
do
it
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
i
dare
not
leans
back
in
his
chair
breathless
with
shining
eyes
robert
rises
quietly
and
stands
behind
his
robert
look
here
richard
we
have
said
all
there
is
to
be
said
let
the
past
be
past
richard
and
wait
one
thing
more
for
you
too
must
know
me
as
i
robert
more
is
there
more
richard
i
told
you
that
when
i
saw
your
eyes
this
afternoon
i
felt
sad
your
humility
and
confusion
i
felt
united
you
to
me
in
brotherhood
turns
half
round
towards
at
that
moment
i
felt
our
whole
life
together
in
the
past
and
i
longed
to
put
my
arm
around
your
neck
robert
and
suddenly
it
is
noble
of
you
richard
to
forgive
me
like
this
richard
with
i
told
you
that
i
wished
you
not
to
do
anything
false
and
secret
against
our
friendship
against
her
not
to
steal
her
from
me
craftily
secretly
the
dark
in
the
robert
my
friend
robert
i
know
and
it
was
noble
of
you
richard
up
at
him
with
a
steady
no
not
noble
ignoble
robert
an
involuntary
how
why
richard
away
again
in
a
lower
that
is
what
i
must
tell
you
too
because
in
the
very
core
of
my
ignoble
heart
i
longed
to
be
betrayed
by
you
and
by
the
dark
in
the
meanly
craftily
by
you
my
best
friend
and
by
her
i
longed
for
that
passionately
and
ignobly
to
be
dishonoured
for
ever
in
love
and
in
lust
to
be
robert
down
places
his
hands
over
richard
s
enough
enough
takes
his
hands
but
no
go
on
richard
to
be
for
ever
a
shameful
creature
and
to
build
up
my
soul
again
out
of
the
ruins
of
its
shame
robert
and
that
is
why
you
wished
that
she
richard
she
has
spoken
always
of
her
innocence
as
i
have
spoken
always
of
my
guilt
humbling
me
robert
from
pride
then
richard
from
pride
and
from
ignoble
longing
and
from
a
motive
deeper
still
robert
i
understand
you
returns
to
his
place
and
begins
to
speak
at
once
drawing
his
chair
robert
may
it
not
be
that
we
are
here
and
now
in
the
presence
of
a
moment
which
will
free
us
as
well
as
the
last
bonds
of
what
is
called
morality
my
friendship
for
you
has
laid
bonds
on
me
richard
light
bonds
apparently
robert
i
acted
in
the
dark
secretly
i
will
do
so
no
longer
have
you
the
courage
to
allow
me
to
act
freely
richard
a
us
robert
growing
a
battle
of
both
our
souls
different
as
they
are
against
all
that
is
false
in
them
and
in
the
world
a
battle
of
your
soul
against
the
spectre
of
fidelity
of
mine
against
the
spectre
of
friendship
all
life
is
a
conquest
the
victory
of
human
passion
over
the
commandments
of
cowardice
will
you
richard
have
you
the
courage
even
if
it
shatters
to
atoms
the
friendship
between
us
even
if
it
breaks
up
for
ever
the
last
illusion
in
your
own
life
there
was
an
eternity
before
we
were
born
another
will
come
after
we
are
dead
the
blinding
instant
of
passion
free
unashamed
is
the
only
gate
by
which
we
can
escape
from
the
misery
of
what
slaves
call
life
is
not
this
the
language
of
your
own
youth
that
i
heard
so
often
from
you
in
this
very
place
where
we
are
sitting
now
have
you
changed
richard
his
hand
across
his

language
of
my
youth

me
up
to
this
point

and
i
have
only
obeyed
your
will

roused
these
words
in
my
brain
your
own
words
shall
we
freely
together
richard
his
together
no
fight
your
part
alone
i
will
not
free

gone
away
richard
towards
the
he
is
waiting
out
there
he

waiting
when

after
all
richard
did
you
think
i
would
not
bertha
i
knew
you
could
not
remain
away
you
see
after
all
you
are
like
all
other
men
you
had
to
come
you
are
jealous
like
the
others
richard
you
seem
annoyed
to
find
me
here
bertha
what
happened
between
you
richard
i
told
him
i
knew
everything
that
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
he
asked
how
i
said
from
you
bertha
does
he
hate
me
richard
i
can
not
read
in
his
heart
bertha
down
yes
he
hates
me
he
believes
i
made
a
fool
of
him
i
knew
he
would
richard
i
told
him
you
were
sincere
with
him
bertha
he
does
not
believe
it
nobody
would
believe
it
i
should
have
told
him
you
richard
i
thought
he
was
a
common
robber
prepared
to
use
even
violence
against
you
i
had
to
protect
you
from
that
bertha
that
i
could
have
done
myself
richard
are
you
sure
bertha
it
would
have
been
enough
to
have
told
him
that
you
knew
i
was
here
now
i
can
find
out
nothing
he
hates
me
he
is
right
to
hate
me
i
have
treated
him
badly
shamefully
richard
her
bertha
look
at
me
bertha
to
well
richard
into
her
eyes
and
then
lets
her
hand
i
can
not
read
in
your
heart
either
bertha
looking
at
you
could
not
remain
away
do
you
not
trust
me
you
can
see
i
am
quite
calm
i
could
have
hidden
it
all
from
you
richard
i
doubt
that
bertha
a
slight
toss
of
her
o
easily
if
i
had
wanted
to
richard
perhaps
you
are
sorry
now
that
you
did
not
bertha
perhaps
i
am
richard
what
a
fool
you
were
to
tell
me
it
would
have
been
so
nice
if
you
had
kept
it
secret
bertha
as
you
do
no
richard
as
i
do
yes
turns
to
goodbye
for
a
while
bertha
are
you
going
richard
naturally
my
part
is
ended
here
bertha
to
her
i
suppose
richard
who
bertha
her
ladyship
i
suppose
it
is
all
planned
so
that
you
may
have
a
good
opportunity
to
meet
her
and
have
an
intellectual
conversation
richard
an
outburst
of
rude
to
meet
the
devil
s
father
bertha
her
hat
and
sits
very
well
you
can
go
now
i
know
what
to
do
richard
approaches
you
don
t
believe
a
word
of
what
you
say
bertha
you
can
go
why
don
t
you
richard
then
you
have
come
here
and
led
him
on
in
this
way
on
account
of
me
is
that
how
it
is
bertha
there
is
one
person
in
all
this
who
is
not
a
fool
and
that
is
you
i
am
though
and
he
is
richard
if
so
you
have
indeed
treated
him
badly
and
shamefully
bertha
at
yes
but
it
was
your
fault
and
i
will
end
it
now
i
am
simply
a
tool
for
you
you
have
no
respect
for
me
you
never
had
because
i
did
what
i
did
richard
and
has
he
respect
bertha
he
has
of
all
the
persons
i
met
since
i
came
back
he
is
the
only
one
who
has
and
he
knows
what
they
only
suspect
and
that
is
why
i
liked
him
from
the
first
and
like
him
still
great
respect
for
me
she
has
why
did
you
not
ask
her
to
come
away
with
you
nine
years
ago
richard
you
know
why
bertha
ask
yourself
bertha
yes
i
know
why
you
knew
the
answer
you
would
get
that
is
why
richard
that
is
not
why
i
did
not
even
ask
you
bertha
yes
you
knew
i
would
go
asked
or
not
i
do
things
but
if
i
do
one
thing
i
can
do
two
things
as
i
have
the
name
i
can
have
the
gains
richard
increasing
bertha
i
accept
what
is
to
be
i
have
trusted
you
i
will
trust
you
still
bertha
to
have
that
against
me
to
leave
me
then
why
do
you
not
defend
me
then
against
him
why
do
you
go
away
from
me
now
without
a
word
dick
my
god
tell
me
what
you
wish
me
to
do
richard

since
his
arms
have
been
around
you
you

near
together
there
is
something
wiser
than
wisdom
in
your
heart

of
your
heart
or
of
any
woman

i
want
to
explain
to
you
about

i
could
not
deceive
dick
never

nothing
i
told
him
the
first
then
it
went
on
and
on
and
still
you
never
spoke
or
asked
me
i
wanted
you
to
robert
is
that
the
truth
bertha
bertha
yes
because
it
annoyed
me
that
you
could
think
i
was
like
like
the
other
women
i
suppose
you
knew
that
way
i
think
that
dick
is
right
too
why
should
there
be
secrets
robert
still
secrets
can
be
very
sweet
can
they
not
bertha
yes
i
know
they
can
but
you
see
i
could
not
keep
things
secret
from
dick
besides
what
is
the
good
they
always
come
out
in
the
end
is
it
not
better
for
people
to
know
robert
and
a
little
how
could
you
bertha
tell
him
everything
did
you
every
single
thing
that
passed
between
us
bertha
yes
everything
he
asked
me
robert
did
he
ask
bertha
you
know
the
kind
he
is
he
asks
about
everything
the
ins
and
outs
robert
about
our
kissing
too
bertha
of
course
i
told
him
all
robert
his
head
extraordinary
little
person
were
you
not
ashamed
bertha
no
robert
not
a
bit
bertha
no
why
is
that
terrible
robert
and
how
did
he
take
it
tell
me
i
want
to
know
everything
too
bertha
it
excited
him
more
than
usual
robert
why
is
he
bertha
yes
very
when
he
is
not
lost
in
his
philosophy
robert
more
than
i
bertha
more
than
you
how
could
i
answer
that
you
both
are
i
suppose
turns
aside
and
gazes
towards
the
porch
passing
his
hand
once
or
twice
thoughtfully
over
his
bertha
are
you
angry
with
me
again
robert
you
are
with
me
bertha
no
robert
why
should
i
be
robert
because
i
asked
you
to
come
to
this
place
i
tried
to
prepare
it
for
you
points
vaguely
here
and
a
sense
of
quietness
bertha
his
jacket
with
her
and
this
too
your
nice
velvet
coat
robert
also
i
will
keep
no
secrets
from
you
bertha
you
remind
me
of
someone
in
a
picture
i
like
you
in
it
but
you
are
not
angry
are
you
robert
yes
that
was
my
mistake
to
ask
you
to
come
here
i
felt
it
when
i
looked
at
you
from
the
garden
and
saw
here
but
what
else
could
i
have
done
bertha
you
mean
because
others
have
been
here
robert
yes
walks
away
from
her
a
few
paces
a
gust
of
wind
makes
the
lamp
on
the
table
flicker
he
lowers
the
wick
bertha
him
with
her
but
i
knew
that
before
i
came
i
am
not
angry
with
you
for
it
robert
his
why
should
you
be
angry
with
me
after
all
you
are
not
even
angry
with
the
same
worse
bertha
did
he
tell
you
that
about
himself
robert
yes
he
told
me
we
all
confess
to
one
another
here
turn
about
bertha
i
try
to
forget
it
robert
it
does
not
trouble
you
bertha
not
now
only
i
dislike
to
think
of
it
robert
it
is
merely
something
brutal
you
think
of
little
importance
bertha
it
does
not
trouble
robert
at
her
over
his
but
there
is
something
that
would
trouble
you
very
much
and
that
you
would
not
try
to
forget
bertha
what
robert
towards
if
it
were
not
only
something
brutal
with
this
person
or
a
few
moments
if
it
were
something
fine
and
one
person
one
woman
and
perhaps
brutal
too
it
usually
comes
to
that
sooner
or
later
would
you
try
to
forget
and
forgive
that
bertha
with
her
in
whom
robert
in
anyone
in
me
bertha
you
mean
in
dick
robert
i
said
in
myself
but
would
you
bertha
you
think
i
would
revenge
myself
is
dick
not
to
be
free
too
robert
at
that
is
not
from
your
heart
bertha
bertha
yes
it
is
let
him
be
free
too
he
leaves
me
free
also
robert
and
you
know
why
and
understand
and
you
like
it
and
you
want
to
be
and
it
makes
you
happy
and
has
made
you
happy
always
this
gift
of
freedom
which
he
gave
years

open

of

you
condemned

i
robert

when

slighted
the
common
simple
gift
i
had
to
offer
took
his
gift
instead
bertha
at
but
you
never
robert
no
because
you
had
chosen
him
i
saw
that
i
saw
it
on
the
first
night
we
met
we
three
together
why
did
you
choose
him
bertha
her
is
that
not
love
robert
and
every
night
when
we
and
to
that
corner
to
meet
you
i
saw
it
and
felt
it
you
remember
the
corner
bertha
bertha
yes
robert
and
when
you
and
he
went
away
for
your
walk
and
i
went
along
the
street
alone
i
felt
it
and
when
he
spoke
to
me
about
you
and
told
me
he
was
going
most
of
all
bertha
why
then
most
of
all
robert
because
it
was
then
that
i
was
guilty
of
my
first
treason
towards
him
bertha
robert
what
are
you
saying
your
first
treason
against
dick
robert
and
not
my
last
he
spoke
of
you
and
himself
of
how
your
life
would
be
and
all
that
free
yes
he
would
not
even
ask
you
to
go
with
him
he
did
not
and
you
went
all
the
same
bertha
i
wanted
to
be
with
him
you
know
her
head
and
looking
at
you
know
how
we
were
and
robert
i
advised
him
to
go
to
take
you
with
live
alone
in
order
to
see
if
what
he
felt
for
you
was
a
passing
thing
which
might
ruin
your
happiness
and
his
career
bertha
well
robert
it
was
unkind
of
you
towards
me
but
i
forgive
you
because
you
were
thinking
of
his
happiness
and
mine
robert
closer
to
no
bertha
i
was
not
and
that
was
my
treason
i
was
thinking
of
you
might
turn
from
him
when
he
had
gone
and
he
from
you
then
i
would
have
offered
you
my
gift
you
know
what
it
was
now
the
simple
common
gift
that
men
offer
to
women
not
the
best
perhaps
best
or
would
have
been
yours
bertha
away
from
he
did
not
take
your
advice
robert
no
and
the
night
you
ran
away
how
happy
i
was
bertha
his
keep
calm

me
always

did
you
not
forget
me
robert

along
the
quays
and
saw
in
the
distance
the
boat
lit
up
going
down
the
black
river
taking
you
away
from
me
a
calmer
but
why
did
you
choose
him
did
you
not
like
me

all
bertha

liked
you
because
you
were
his
friend

yes

about
dick

here
it
is
a
long
article
a
leading
article
by
my
cousin
all
his
life
is
here
do
you
wish
to
see
it
bertha
the
paper
and
opens
where
is
it
beatrice
in
the
middle
it
is
headed
distinguished
bertha
is
it
for
dick
or
against
him
beatrice
o
for
him
you
can
read
what
he
says
about
mr
rowan
and
i
know
that
robert
stayed
in
town
very
late
last
night
to
write
it
bertha
yes
are
you
sure
beatrice
yes
very
late
i
heard
him
come
home
it
was
long
after
two
bertha
it
alarmed
you
i
mean
to
be
awakened
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
beatrice
i
am
a
light
sleeper
but
i
knew
he
had
come
from
the
office
and
then
i
suspected
he
had
written
an
article
about
mr
rowan
and
that
was
why
he
came
so
late
bertha
how
quick
you
were
to
think
of
that
beatrice
well
after
what
took
place
here
yesterday
mean
what
robert
said
that
mr
rowan
had
accepted
this
position
it
was
only
natural
i
should
think
bertha
ah
yes
naturally
beatrice
but
that
is
not
what
alarmed
me
but
immediately
after
i
heard
a
noise
in
my
cousin
s
room
bertha
together
the
paper
in
her
hands
my
god
what
is
it
tell
me
beatrice
why
does
that
upset
you
so
much
bertha
back
with
a
forced
yes
of
course
it
is
very
foolish
of
me
my
nerves
are
all
upset
i
slept
very
badly
too
that
is
why
i
got
up
so
early
but
tell
me
what
was
it
then
beatrice
only
the
noise
of
his
valise
being
pulled
along
the
floor
then
i
heard
him
walking
about
his
room
whistling
softly
and
then
locking
it
and
strapping
it
bertha
he
is
going
away
beatrice
that
was
what
alarmed
me
i
feared
he
had
had
a
quarrel
with
mr
rowan
and
that
his
article
was
an
attack
bertha
but
why
should
they
quarrel
have
you
noticed
anything
between
them
beatrice
i
thought
i
did
a
coldness
bertha
lately
beatrice
for
some
time
past
bertha
the
paper
do
you
know
the
reason
beatrice
no
bertha
a
well
but
if
this
article
is
for
him
as
you
say
they
have
not
quarrelled
reflects
a
and
written
last
night
too
beatrice
yes
i
bought
the
paper
at
once
to
see
but
why
then
is
he
going
away
so
suddenly
i
feel
that
there
is
something
wrong
i
feel
that
something
has
happened
between
them
bertha
would
you
be
sorry
beatrice
i
would
be
very
sorry
you
see
mrs
rowan
robert
is
my
first
cousin
and
it
would
grieve
me
very
deeply
if
he
were
to
treat
mr
rowan
badly
now
that
he
has
come
back
or
if
they
had
a
serious
quarrel
especially
because
bertha
with
the
because
beatrice
because
it
was
my
cousin
who
urged
mr
rowan
always
to
come
back
i
have
that
on
my
conscience
bertha
it
should
be
on
mr
hand
s
conscience
should
it
not
beatrice
on
mine
too
spoke
to
my
cousin
about
mr
rowan
when
he
was
away
and
to
a
certain
extent
it
was
i
bertha
i
see
and
that
is
on
your
conscience
only
that
beatrice
i
think
so
bertha
it
looks
as
if
it
was
you
miss
justice
who
brought
my
husband
back
to
ireland
beatrice
i
mrs
rowan
bertha
yes
you
by
your
letters
to
him
and
then
by
speaking
to
your
cousin
as
you
said
just
now
do
you
not
think
that
you
are
the
person
who
brought
him
back
beatrice
no
i
could
not
think
that
bertha
her
for
a
moment
then

much
since
he
came
back

believe
you

course
mrs
rowan
when
you
tell
me
bertha
down

it
must
be
about
something

change
do
you
know
that

looks
searchingly
at
do
you
know
it
or
feel
it
beatrice
her
look
mrs

that
is
not
a
question
to
ask
me
if

change
has
come
into
his
life
since

came
back
you

i
will
send
brigid
across
with
it
brigid
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
left
beatrice
after
her
instinctively
it
is
true
then
glances
toward
the
door
of
richard
s
study
and
catches
her
head
in
her
hands
then
recovering
herself
she
takes
the
paper
from
the
little
table
opens
it
takes
a
spectacle
case
from
her
handbag
and
putting
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
bends
down
reading
it
richard
rowan
enters
from
the
garden
he
is
dressed
as
before
but
wears
a
soft
hat
and
carries
a
thin
richard
in
the
doorway
observing
her
for
some
there
are
demons
points
out
towards
the
out
there
i
heard
them
jabbering
since
dawn
beatrice
to
her
mr
rowan
richard
i
assure
you
the
isle
is
full
of
voices
yours
also
i
could
not
see
you
it
said
and
her
voice
but
i
assure
you
they
are
all
demons
i
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upside
down
and
that
silenced
them
beatrice
i
came
here
mr
rowan
so
early
because
to
show
you
this
robert
wrote
it
about
you
last
night
richard
off
his
my
dear
miss
justice
you
told
me
yesterday
i
think
why
you
came
here
and
i
never
forget
anything
towards
her
holding
out
his
good
morning
beatrice
takes
off
her
spectacles
and
places
the
paper
in
his
i
came
for
this
it
is
an
article
about
you
robert
wrote
it
last
night
will
you
read
it
richard
read
it
now
certainly
beatrice
at
him
in
o
mr
rowan
it
makes
me
suffer
to
look
at
you
richard
and
reads
the
of
the
very
reverend
canon
is
that
it
appears
at
the
door
on
the
left
and
stands
to
richard
over
a
yes
here
we
are
distinguished
begins
to
read
in
a
rather
loud
hard
not
the
least
vital
of
the
problems
which
confront
our
country
is
the
problem
of
her
attitude
towards
those
of
her
children
who
having
left
her
in
her
hour
of
need
have
been
called
back
to
her
now
on
the
eve
of
her
longawaited
victory
to
her
whom
in
loneliness
and
exile
they
have
at
last
learned
to
love
in
exile
we
have
said
but
here
we
must
distinguish
there
is
an
economic
and
there
is
a
spiritual
exile
there
are
those
who
left
her
to
seek
the
bread
by
which
men
live
and
there
are
others
nay
her
most
favoured
children
who
left
her
to
seek
in
other
lands
that
food
of
the
spirit
by
which
a
nation
of
human
beings
is
sustained
in
life
those
who
recall
the
intellectual
life
of
dublin
of
a
decade
since
will
have
many
memories
of
mr
rowan
something
of
that
fierce
indignation
which
lacerated
the
heart
raises
his
eyes
from
the
paper
and
sees
bertha
standing
in
the
doorway
then
he
lays
aside
the
paper
and
looks
at
her
a
long
beatrice
an
you
see
mr
rowan
your
day
has
dawned
at
last
even
here

you
see
that

a
warm
friend

friend
who
understands
you

did
you
notice
the
little
phrase
at
the
beginning

left
her
in
her
hour
of
need
looks
searchingly
at
bertha

and
walks
into
his
study

the
door

used
to
look
at
different
persons
coming
out
of
churches
or
going
by

think
that

they
were
like

up
the

down
the

in
the
air

richard
in
your
hour
of

to
it
richard

myself
i
am
what
i
am
bertha
to
have
it
always
to
throw
against
me
to
make
me
humble
before
you
as
you
always
did
to
be
free
yourself
towards
the
with
her
and
that

your

had
in
