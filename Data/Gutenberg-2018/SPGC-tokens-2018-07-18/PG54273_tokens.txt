i
you
promised
i
reminded
patton
to
play
with
cards
on
the
my
dear
young
lady
he
replied
i
have
no
cards
i
suspect
a
game
that
s
you
need
me
the
detective
bent
forward
his
arms
on
his
desk
and
looked
me
over
carefully
what
sort
of
shape
are
you
in
tired
nervous
not
enough
to
i
want
you
to
take
another
case
following
a
nurse
who
has
gone
to
pieces
he
said
selecting
his
words
carefully
i
don
t
want
to
tell
you
a
want
you
to
go
in
with
a
fresh
mind
it
promises
to
be
an
extraordinary
how
long
was
the
other
nurse
there
four
she
went
to
pieces
in
four
days
well
she
s
pretty
much
unstrung
the
worst
is
she
hasn
t
any
real
reason
a
family
chooses
to
live
in
an
unusual
manner
because
they
like
it
or
perhaps
they
re
afraid
of
something
the
girl
was
that
s
sure
i
had
never
seen
her
until
this
morning
a
big
young
woman
but
she
came
in
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
as
if
she
expected
a
knife
in
her
back
she
said
she
was
a
nurse
from
luke
s
and
that
she
d
been
on
a
case
for
four
days
she
d
left
that
morning
after
about
three
hours
sleep
in
that
time
being
locked
in
a
room
most
of
the
time
and
having
little
but
crackers
and
milk
for
food
she
thought
it
was
a
case
for
the
who
is
ill
in
the
house
who
was
her
patient
there
is
no
illness
i
believe
the
french
governess
had
gone
and
they
wished
the
children
competently
cared
for
until
they
replaced
her
that
was
the
reason
given
her
when
she
went
afterward
she
was
how
are
you
going
to
get
me
there
he
gathered
acquiescence
from
my
question
and
smiled
approval
good
girl
he
said
never
mind
how
i
ll
get
you
there
you
are
the
most
dependable
woman
i
the
most
curious
perhaps
i
retorted
four
days
on
the
case
three
hours
sleep
locked
in
and
yelling
police
is
it
out
of
town
no
in
the
heart
of
the
city
on
beauregard
square
can
you
get
some
luke
s
uniforms
they
want
another
luke
s
i
said
i
could
get
the
uniforms
and
he
wrote
the
address
on
a
card
better
arrive
about
five
he
said
they
are
not
expecting
me
they
will
be
expecting
you
he
replied
enigmatically
the
doctor
if
he
s
a
luke
s
there
is
no
it
was
six
months
since
i
had
solved
or
helped
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
buckled
bag
for
patton
i
had
had
other
cases
for
him
in
the
interval
cases
where
the
police
could
not
get
close
enough
as
i
said
when
i
began
this
record
of
my
crusade
against
crime
and
the
criminal
a
trained
nurse
gets
under
the
very
skin
of
the
soul
she
finds
a
mind
surrendered
all
the
crooked
little
motives
that
have
fired
the
guns
of
life
revealed
in
their
pitifulness
gradually
i
had
come
to
see
that
patton
s
point
of
view
was
right
that
if
the
criminal
uses
every
means
against
society
why
not
society
against
the
criminal
at
first
i
had
used
this
as
a
flag
of
truce
to
my
nurse
s
ethical
training
now
i
flaunted
it
a
mental
and
moral
banner
the
criminal
against
society
and
i
against
the
criminal
and
more
than
that
against
misery
healing
pain
by
augmenting
it
sometimes
but
working
like
a
surgeon
for
good
i
had
had
six
cases
in
six
months
only
in
one
had
i
failed
to
land
my
criminal
and
that
without
any
suspicion
of
my
white
uniform
and
shoes
although
i
played
a
double
game
no
patient
of
mine
had
suffered
i
was
a
nurse
first
and
a
police
agent
second
if
it
was
a
question
between
turpentine
seeing
what
letters
came
in
or
went
out
of
the
house
the
compress
went
on
first
and
cracking
hot
too
i
am
not
boasting
that
is
my
method
the
only
way
i
can
work
and
it
speaks
well
for
it
that
as
i
say
only
one
man
escaped
arson
case
where
the
factory
owner
hanged
himself
in
the
bathroom
needle
shower
in
the
house
he
had
bought
with
the
insurance
money
while
i
was
fixing
his
breakfast
tray
and
even
he
might
have
been
saved
for
justice
had
the
cook
not
burned
the
toast
and
been
obliged
to
make
it
fresh
i
was
no
longer
staying
at
a
nurses
home
i
had
taken
a
bachelor
suite
of
three
rooms
and
bath
comfortably
downtown
i
cooked
my
own
breakfasts
when
i
was
off
duty
and
i
dined
at
a
restaurant
near
luncheon
i
did
not
bother
much
about
now
and
then
patton
telephoned
me
and
we
lunched
together
in
remote
places
where
we
would
not
be
known
he
would
tell
me
of
his
cases
and
sometimes
he
asked
my
advice
i
bought
my
uniforms
that
day
and
took
them
home
in
a
taxicab
the
dresses
were
blue
and
over
them
for
the
street
the
luke
s
girls
wear
long
cloaks
english
fashion
of
navy
blue
serge
and
a
blue
bonnet
with
a
white
ruching
and
white
lawn
ties
i
felt
curious
in
it
but
it
was
becoming
and
convenient
certainly
i
looked
professional
at
three
o
clock
that
afternoon
a
messenger
brought
a
small
box
registered
it
contained
a
luke
s
badge
of
gold
and
blue
enamel
at
four
o
clock
my
telephone
rang
i
was
packing
my
suitcase
according
to
the
list
i
keep
pasted
in
the
lid
under
the
list
which
was
of
uniforms
aprons
thermometer
instruments
a
nurse
s
simple
set
of
probe
forceps
and
bandage
scissors
was
the
word
this
always
went
in
wooden
box
with
a
lock
the
key
of
which
was
round
my
neck
it
contained
skeleton
keys
a
small
black
revolver
of
which
i
was
in
deadly
fear
a
pair
of
handcuffs
a
pocket
flashlight
and
my
badge
from
the
chief
of
police
i
was
examining
the
revolver
nervously
when
the
telephone
rang
and
i
came
within
an
ace
of
sending
a
bullet
into
the
flat
below
did
you
ever
notice
how
much
you
get
out
of
a
telephone
voice
we
can
dissemble
with
our
faces
but
under
stress
the
vocal
cords
seem
to
draw
up
tight
and
the
voice
comes
thin
and
colorless
there
s
a
little
woman
in
the
flat
one
i
nearly
sings
like
a
bird
at
her
piano
half
the
day
scaling
vocal
heights
that
make
me
dizzy
now
and
then
she
has
a
visitor
a
nice
young
man
and
she
disgraces
herself
flats
f
fogs
e
even
finally
takes
cowardly
refuge
in
a
wretched
and
cries
herself
to
sleep
doubtless
later
on
the
man
who
called
me
had
the
voice
of
extreme
youngish
voice
miss
adams
he
said
this
is
francis
reed
speaking
i
have
called
luke
s
and
they
referred
me
to
you
are
you
free
to
take
a
case
this
afternoon
i
fenced
i
was
trying
to
read
the
voice
this
afternoon
well
before
night
anyhow
early
this
evening
as
the
voice
was
strained
and
tired
desperately
tired
it
was
not
peevish
it
was
even
rather
pleasant
what
is
the
case
reed
he
hesitated
it
is
not
illness
it
is
governess
has
gone
and
there
are
two
small
children
we
want
some
one
to
give
her
undivided
attention
to
the
i
are
you
a
heavy
sleeper
miss
adams
a
very
light
i
fancied
he
breathed
freer
i
hope
you
are
not
tired
from
a
previous
case
i
was
beginning
to
like
the
voice
i
m
quite
fresh
i
replied
almost
gayly
even
if
i
were
not
i
like
children
especially
well
ones
i
shan
t
find
looking
after
them
very
wearying
i
m
again
the
odd
little
pause
then
he
gave
me
the
address
on
beauregard
square
and
asked
me
to
be
sure
not
to
be
late
i
must
warn
you
he
added
we
are
living
in
a
sort
of
casual
way
our
servants
left
us
without
warning
reed
has
been
getting
along
as
best
she
could
most
of
our
meals
are
being
sent
i
was
thinking
fast
no
servants
a
good
many
people
think
a
trained
nurse
is
a
sort
of
upper
servant
i
ve
been
in
houses
where
they
were
amazed
to
discover
that
i
was
a
college
woman
and
finding
the
two
things
irreconcilable
have
openly
accused
me
of
having
been
driven
to
such
a
desperate
course
as
a
hospital
training
by
an
unfortunate
love
affair
of
course
you
understand
that
i
will
look
after
the
children
to
the
best
of
my
ability
but
that
i
will
not
replace
the
i
fancied
he
smiled
grimly
that
of
course
will
you
ring
twice
when
you
come
ring
twice
the
doorbell
he
replied
impatiently
i
said
i
would
ring
the
doorbell
twice
the
young
woman
below
was
caroling
gayly
ignorant
of
the
menace
over
her
head
i
knelt
again
by
my
suitcase
but
packed
little
and
thought
a
great
deal
i
was
to
arrive
before
dusk
at
a
house
where
there
were
no
servants
and
to
ring
the
doorbell
twice
i
was
to
be
a
light
sleeper
although
i
was
to
look
after
two
healthy
children
it
was
not
much
in
itself
but
taken
in
connection
with
the
previous
nurse
s
appeal
to
the
police
it
took
on
new
possibilities
at
six
i
started
out
to
dinner
it
was
early
spring
and
cold
but
quite
light
at
the
first
corner
i
saw
patton
waiting
for
a
street
car
and
at
his
quick
nod
i
saw
i
was
to
get
in
also
he
did
not
pay
my
fare
or
speak
to
me
it
was
a
part
of
the
game
that
we
were
never
seen
together
except
at
the
remote
restaurant
i
mentioned
before
the
car
thinned
out
and
i
could
watch
him
easily
far
downtown
he
alighted
and
so
did
i
the
restaurant
was
near
i
went
in
alone
and
sat
down
at
a
table
in
a
recess
and
very
soon
he
joined
me
we
were
in
the
main
dining
room
but
not
of
it
a
sop
at
once
to
the
conventions
and
to
the
necessity
where
he
was
so
well
known
for
caution
i
got
a
little
affair
we
were
talking
of
he
said
as
he
sat
down
i
m
not
so
sure
i
want
you
to
take
the
case
after
certainly
i
shall
take
it
i
retorted
with
some
sharpness
i
ve
promised
to
tut
i
m
not
going
to
send
you
into
danger
i
am
not
exactly
a
lot
of
generals
were
lost
in
the
civil
war
because
they
were
not
afraid
and
wanted
to
lead
their
troops
instead
of
saving
themselves
and
their
expensive
west
point
training
by
sitting
back
in
a
safe
spot
and
directing
the
fight
any
fool
can
run
into
danger
it
takes
intellect
to
keep
i
felt
my
color
rising
indignantly
then
you
brought
me
here
to
tell
me
i
am
not
to
go
will
you
let
me
read
you
two
reports
you
could
have
told
me
that
at
the
corner
will
you
let
me
read
you
two
reports
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
first
order
something
to
eat
i
m
to
be
there
before
will
you
let
i
m
going
and
you
know
i
m
going
if
you
don
t
want
me
to
represent
you
i
ll
go
on
my
own
they
want
a
nurse
and
they
re
in
i
think
he
was
really
angry
i
know
i
was
if
there
is
anything
that
takes
the
very
soul
out
of
a
woman
it
is
to
be
kept
from
doing
a
thing
she
has
set
her
heart
on
because
some
man
thinks
it
dangerous
if
she
has
any
spirit
that
rouses
it
patton
quietly
replaced
the
reports
in
his
wallet
and
his
wallet
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
fell
to
a
judicial
survey
of
the
menu
but
although
he
did
not
even
glance
at
me
he
must
have
felt
the
determination
in
my
face
for
he
ordered
things
that
were
quickly
prepared
and
told
the
waiter
to
hurry
i
have
wondered
lately
he
said
slowly
whether
the
mildness
of
your
manner
at
the
hospital
was
acting
or
the
chastening
effect
of
three
years
under
an
order
a
man
always
likes
a
woman
to
be
a
not
at
all
but
it
is
rather
disconcerting
to
have
a
pet
lamb
turn
round
and
take
a
bite
out
of
will
you
read
the
reports
now
i
think
he
said
quietly
they
would
better
wait
until
we
have
eaten
we
will
probably
both
feel
calmer
suppose
we
arrange
that
nothing
said
before
the
oysters
counts
i
agreed
rather
sulkily
and
the
meal
went
off
well
enough
i
was
anxious
enough
to
hurry
but
he
ate
deliberately
drank
his
paid
the
waiter
and
at
last
met
my
impatient
eyes
and
smiled
after
all
he
said
since
you
are
determined
to
go
anyhow
what
s
the
use
of
reading
the
reports
inside
of
an
hour
you
ll
know
all
you
need
to
but
he
saw
that
i
did
not
take
his
teasing
well
and
drew
out
his
pocketbook
they
were
two
typewritten
papers
clamped
together
they
are
on
my
desk
before
me
now
the
first
one
is
indorsed
statement
by
laura
bosworth
nurse
of
luke
s
home
for
graduate
nurses
miss
bosworth
says
i
do
not
know
just
why
i
came
here
but
i
know
i
m
frightened
that
s
the
fact
i
think
there
is
something
terribly
wrong
in
the
house
of
francis
reed
beauregard
square
i
think
a
crime
of
some
sort
has
been
committed
there
are
four
people
in
the
family
and
reed
and
two
children
i
was
to
look
after
the
children
i
was
there
four
days
and
the
children
were
never
allowed
out
of
the
room
at
night
we
were
locked
in
i
kept
wondering
what
i
would
do
if
there
was
a
fire
the
telephone
wires
are
cut
so
no
one
can
call
the
house
and
i
believe
the
doorbell
is
disconnected
too
but
that
s
fixed
now
reed
went
round
all
the
time
with
a
face
like
chalk
and
her
eyes
staring
at
all
hours
of
the
night
she
d
unlock
the
bedroom
door
and
come
in
and
look
at
the
children
almost
all
the
doors
through
the
house
were
locked
if
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
kitchen
to
boil
eggs
for
the
children
s
there
were
no
servants
and
reed
was
young
and
didn
t
know
anything
about
reed
had
to
unlock
about
four
doors
for
me
if
reed
looked
bad
he
was
eyed
and
white
and
wouldn
t
eat
i
think
he
has
killed
somebody
and
is
making
away
with
the
body
last
night
i
said
i
had
to
have
air
and
they
let
me
go
out
i
called
up
a
friend
from
a
another
nurse
this
morning
she
sent
me
a
letter
that
i
was
needed
on
another
case
and
i
got
away
that
s
all
it
sounds
foolish
but
try
it
and
see
if
it
doesn
t
get
on
your
nerves
patton
looked
up
at
me
as
he
finished
reading
now
you
see
what
i
mean
he
said
that
woman
was
there
four
days
and
she
is
as
temperamental
as
a
cow
but
in
those
four
days
her
nervous
system
went
to
doors
locked
i
reflected
servants
gone
state
of
looks
like
a
siege
but
why
a
trained
nurse
why
not
a
policeman
if
there
is
danger
why
any
one
at
all
if
there
is
something
that
the
police
are
not
to
know
that
is
what
i
intend
to
find
out
i
replied
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
read

nurse

four
o
clock
from
a
store
on
eleventh
street

that
his
telephone
was
out
of
order
patton
folded
up
the
papers
and
thrust
them
back
into
his
pocket
evidently
he
saw
i
was
determined
for
he
only
said
have
you
got
your
revolver
do
you
know
anything
about
telephones
could
you
repair
that
one
in
an
emergency
in
an
emergency
i
retorted
there
is
no
time
to
repair
a
telephone
but
i
ve
got
a
voice
and
there
are
windows
if
i
really
put
my
mind
to
it
you
will
hear
me
yell
at
he
smiled
grimly
ii
the
reed
house
is
on
beauregard
square
it
is
a
small
exclusive
community
the
beauregard
neighborhood
a
dozen
or
more
solid
citizens
built
their
homes
there
in
the
early
s
occupying
large
lots
the
houses
flush
with
the
streets
and
with
gardens
behind
six
on
one
street
six
on
another
back
to
back
with
the
gardens
in
the
center
they
occupied
the
whole
block
and
the
gardens
were
not
fenced
off
but
made
a
sort
of
small
park
unsuspected
from
the
streets
here
and
there
bits
of
flowering
shrubbery
sketchily
outlined
a
property
but
the
general
impression
was
of
lawn
and
trees
free
of
access
to
all
the
owners
thus
with
the
square
in
front
and
the
gardens
in
the
rear
the
reed
house
faced
in
two
directions
on
the
early
spring
green
in
the
gardens
the
old
tar
walks
were
still
there
and
a
fountain
which
no
longer
played
but
on
whose
stone
coping
i
believe
the
young
beauregard
squarites
made
their
first
climbing
ventures
the
gardens
were
always
alive
with
birds
and
later
on
from
my
windows
i
learned
the
reason
it
seems
to
have
been
a
custom
sanctified
by
years
that
the
crumbs
from
the
twelve
tables
should
be
thrown
into
the
dry
basin
of
the
fountain
for
the
birds
it
was
a
common
sight
to
see
stately
butlers
and
little
waitresses
in
black
and
white
coming
out
after
luncheon
or
dinner
with
silver
trays
of
crumbs
many
a
scrap
of
gossip
as
well
as
scrap
of
food
has
been
passed
along
at
the
old
stone
fountain
i
believe
i
know
that
it
was
there
that
i
heard
of
the
basement
ghost
of
beauregard
whisper
at
first
a
panic
later
i
arrived
at
eight
o
clock
and
rang
the
doorbell
twice
the
door
was
opened
at
once
by
reed
a
tall
blond
young
man
carefully
dressed
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
when
he
saw
me
and
shook
hands
the
hall
was
brightly
lighted
and
most
cheerful
in
fact
the
whole
house
was
ablaze
with
light
certainly
nothing
could
be
less
mysterious
than
the
house
or
than
the
debonair
young
man
who
motioned
me
into
the
library
i
told
reed
i
would
talk
to
you
before
you
go
upstairs
he
said
will
you
sit
down
i
sat
down
the
library
was
even
brighter
than
the
hall
and
now
i
saw
that
although
he
smiled
as
cheerfully
as
ever
his
face
was
almost
colorless
and
his
eyes
which
looked
frankly
enough
into
mine
for
a
moment
went
wandering
off
round
the
room
i
had
the
impression
somehow
that
patton
had
had
of
the
nurse
at
headquarters
that
he
looked
as
if
he
expected
a
knife
in
his
back
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
wanted
to
look
over
his
shoulder
and
by
sheer
did
not
you
know
the
rule
miss
adams
he
said
when
there
s
an
emergency
get
a
trained
nurse
i
told
you
our
servants
and
two
small
this
should
be
a
good
time
to
secure
servants
i
said
briskly
city
houses
are
being
deserted
for
country
places
and
a
percentage
of
servants
won
t
leave
he
hesitated
we
ve
been
doing
very
nicely
although
of
course
it
s
hardly
more
than
just
living
our
meals
are
sent
in
from
a
hotel
we
thought
since
we
are
going
away
so
soon
that
perhaps
we
could
the
impulse
was
too
strong
for
him
at
that
moment
he
wheeled
and
looked
behind
him
not
a
hasty
glance
but
a
deliberate
inspection
that
took
in
every
part
of
that
end
of
the
room
it
was
so
unexpected
that
it
left
me
gasping
the
next
moment
he
was
himself
again
when
i
say
that
there
is
no
illness
he
said
i
am
hardly
exact
there
is
no
illness
but
there
has
been
an
epidemic
of
children
s
diseases
among
the
beauregard
square
children
and
we
are
keeping
the
youngsters
don
t
you
think
they
could
be
safeguarded
without
being
shut
up
in
the
house
he
responded
eagerly
if
i
only
he
checked
himself
no
he
said
decidedly
for
a
time
at
least
i
believe
it
is
not
i
did
not
argue
with
him
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
antagonizing
him
and
as
reed
came
in
just
then
the
subject
was
dropped
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
girl
almost
as
blond
as
her
husband
very
pretty
and
with
the
weariest
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
unless
perhaps
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
has
waited
a
long
time
for
deathly
tuberculosis
i
liked
her
at
once
she
did
not
attempt
to
smile
she
rather
clung
to
my
hand
when
i
held
it
out
i
am
glad
luke
s
still
trusts
us
she
said
i
was
afraid
the
other
frank
will
you
take
miss
adams
suitcase
upstairs
she
held
out
a
key
he
took
it
but
he
turned
at
the
door
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
wear
those
things
anne
you
gave
me
your
promise
yesterday
you
i
can
t
work
round
the
children
in
anything
else
she
protested
those
things
were
charming
she
wore
a
rose
silk
negligee
trimmed
with
soft
bands
of
lace
and
blue
satin
flowers
a
petticoat
to
match
that
garment
and
a
lace
cap
he
hesitated
in
the
doorway
and
looked
at
curious
glance
i
thought
full
of
tenderness
perhaps
i
ll
take
it
off
dear
she
replied
to
the
glance
i
wanted
miss
adams
to
know
that
even
if
we
haven
t
a
servant
in
the
house
we
are
at
least
civilized
haven
t
taken
this
last
was
clearly
an
afterthought
he
went
out
then
and
left
us
together
she
came
over
to
me
swiftly
what
did
the
other
nurse
say
she
demanded
i
do
not
know
her
at
all
i
have
not
seen
didn
t
she
report
at
the
hospital
that
we
i
smiled
that
s
hardly
likely
is
it
unexpectedly
she
went
to
the
door
opening
into
the
hall
and
closed
it
coming
back
swiftly
mr
reed
thinks
it
is
not
necessary
are
some
things
that
will
puzzle
you
perhaps
i
should
have
spoken
to
the
other
nurse
anything
strikes
you
as
unusual
miss
adams
just
please
don
t
see
it
it
is
all
right
everything
is
all
right
but
something
has
very
much
but
we
are
all
of
us
doing
the
very
best
we
she
was
quivering
with
nervousness
i
was
not
the
police
agent
then
i
m
afraid
nurses
are
accustomed
to
disturbing
things
perhaps
i
can
you
can
by
watching
the
children
that
s
the
only
thing
that
matters
to
children
i
don
t
want
them
left
alone
if
you
have
to
leave
them
call
don
t
you
think
i
will
be
able
to
watch
them
more
intelligently
if
i
know
just
what
the
danger
is
i
think
she
very
nearly
told
me
she
was
so
tired
evidently
so
anxious
to
shift
her
burden
to
fresh
shoulders
mr
reed
said
i
prompted
her
that
there
was
an
epidemic
of
children
s
diseases
but
from
what
you
but
i
was
not
to
learn
after
all
for
her
husband
opened
the
hall
door
yes
children
s
diseases
she
said
vaguely
so
many
children
are
down
shall
we
go
up
frank
the
extraordinary
bareness
of
the
house
had
been
dawning
on
me
for
some
time
it
was
well
lighted
and
well
furnished
but
the
floors
were
innocent
of
rugs
the
handsome
furniture
was
without
arrangement
and
in
the
library
at
least
stood
huddled
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
hall
and
stairs
were
also
uncarpeted
but
there
were
marks
where
carpets
had
recently
lain
and
had
been
jerked
up
the
progress
up
the
staircase
was
not
calculated
to
soothe
my
nerves
the
thought
of
my
little
revolver
locked
in
my
suitcase
was
poor
comfort
for
with
every
four
steps
or
so
reed
who
led
the
way
turned
automatically
and
peered
into
the
hallway
below
he
was
listening
too
his
head
bent
slightly
forward
and
each
time
that
he
turned
his
wife
behind
me
turned
also
cold
terror
suddenly
got
me
by
the
spine
and
yet
the
hall
was
bright
with
light
note
surely
fear
is
a
contagion
could
one
isolate
the
germ
of
it
and
find
an
antitoxin
or
is
it
merely
a
form
of
nervous
activity
run
amuck
like
a
runaway
locomotive
colliding
with
other
nervous
activities
and
causing
catastrophe
take
this
up
with
patton
but
would
he
know
he
i
am
almost
sure
has
never
been
really
afraid
i
had
a
vision
of
my
oxlike
predecessor
making
this
journey
up
the
staircase
and
in
spite
of
my
nervousness
i
smiled
but
at
that
moment
reed
behind
me
put
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
i
screamed
i
remember
yet
the
way
she
dropped
back
against
the
wall
and
turned
white
reed
whirled
on
me
instantly
what
did
you
see
he
demanded
nothing
at
i
was
horribly
ashamed
your
wife
touched
my
arm
unexpectedly
i
dare
say
i
am
it
s
all
right
anne
he
reassured
her
and
to
me
almost
irritably
i
thought
you
nurses
had
no
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
have
it
was
all
ridiculous
we
were
still
on
the
staircase
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
if
you
will
stop
looking
down
into
that
hall
i
ll
be
calm
enough
you
make
me
he
muttered
something
about
being
sorry
and
went
on
quickly
but
at
the
top
he
went
through
an
inward
struggle
evidently
succumbed
and
took
a
final
furtive
survey
of
the
hallway
below
i
was
so
wrought
up
that
had
a
door
slammed
anywhere
just
then
i
think
i
should
have
dropped
where
i
stood
the
absolute
silence
of
the
house
added
to
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
beauregard
square
is
not
close
to
a
trolley
line
and
quiet
is
the
neighborhood
tradition
the
first
vehicles
in
the
city
drew
up
before
beauregard
square
houses
beauregard
square
children
speak
in
low
voices
and
never
bang
their
spoons
on
their
plates
beauregard
square
servants
wear
shoes
and
such
outside
noises
as
venture
to
intrude
themselves
must
filter
through
double
brick
walls
and
doors
built
when
lumber
was
selling
by
the
thousand
acres
instead
of
the
square
foot
through
this
silence
our
feet
echoed
along
the
bare
floor
of
the
upper
hall
as
well
lighted
as
belowstairs
and
as
dismantled
to
the
door
of
the
day
nursery
the
door
was
locked
in
fact
for
the
key
had
been
turned
in
the
lock
and
in
addition
an
ordinary
bolt
had
been
newly
fastened
on
the
outside
of
the
door
on
the
outside
was
that
to
keep
me
in
it
was
certainly
not
to
keep
any
one
or
anything
out
the
feeblest
touch
moved
the
bolt
we
were
all
three
outside
the
door
we
seemed
to
keep
our
compactness
by
common
consent
no
one
of
us
left
the
group
willingly
or
leaving
it
we
slid
back
again
quickly
that
was
my
impression
at
least
but
the
bolt
rather
alarmed
me
this
is
your
room
reed
said
it
is
generally
the
day
nursery
but
we
have
put
a
bed
and
some
other
things
in
it
i
hope
you
will
be
i
touched
the
bolt
with
my
finger
and
smiled
into
reed
s
eyes
i
hope
i
am
not
to
be
fastened
in
i
said
he
looked
back
squarely
enough
but
somehow
i
knew
he
lied
certainly
not
he
replied
and
opened
the
door
if
there
had
been
mystery
outside
and
bareness
the
nursery
was
corner
room
with
many
windows
hung
with
the
simplest
of
nursery
papers
and
full
of
closets
filled
with
orderly
rows
of
toys
in
one
corner
a
small
single
bed
had
been
added
without
spoiling
the
room
the
were
full
of
flowering
plants
there
was
a
bowl
of
goldfish
on
a
stand
and
a
tiny
dwarf
parrot
in
a
cage
was
covered
against
the
night
air
by
a
bright
afghan
a
bathroom
connected
with
this
room
and
also
with
the
night
nursery
beyond
reed
did
not
come
in
i
had
an
uneasy
feeling
however
that
he
was
just
beyond
the
door
the
children
were
not
asleep
reed
left
me
to
let
me
put
on
my
uniform
when
she
came
back
her
face
was
troubled
they
are
not
sleeping
well
she
complained
i
suppose
it
comes
from
having
no
exercise
they
are
always
i
ll
take
their
temperatures
i
said
sometimes
a
tepid
bath
and
a
cup
of
hot
milk
will
make
them
the
two
little
boys
were
wide
awake
they
sat
up
to
look
at
me
and
both
spoke
at
once
can
you
tell
fairy
tales
out
of
your
head
did
you
see
chang
they
were
small
youngsters
adorably
clean
and
rumpled
chang
is
their
dog
a
pekingese
explained
the
mother
he
has
been
lost
for
several
but
he
isn
t
lost
mother
i
can
hear
him
crying
every
now
and
then
you
ll
look
again
mother
won
t
you
we
heard
him
through
the
furnace
pipe
shrilled
the
smaller
of
the
two
you
said
you
would
i
did
look
darlings
he
isn
t
there
and
you
promised
not
to
cry
about
him
freddie
thus
put
on
his
honor
protested
he
was
not
crying
for
the
dog
i
want
to
go
out
and
take
a
walk
that
s
why
i
m
crying
he
wailed
and
i
want
mademoiselle
and
my
buttons
are
all
off
and
my
ear
aches
when
i
lie
on
the
room
was
close
i
threw
up
the
windows
and
turned
to
find
reed
at
my
elbows
she
was
glancing
out
apprehensively
i
suppose
the
air
is
necessary
she
said
and
these
windows
are
all
right
have
a
reason
for
asking
do
not
open
the
she
went
very
soon
and
i
listened
as
she
went
out
i
had
promised
to
lock
the
door
behind
her
and
i
did
so
the
bolt
outside
was
not
shot
after
i
had
quieted
the
children
with
my
mildest
fairy
story
i
made
a
quiet
inventory
of
my
new
quarters
the
rough
diagram
of
the
second
floor
is
the
one
i
gave
patton
later
that
night
of
course
i
investigated
only
the
two
nurseries
but
so
strangely
had
the
fear
that
hung
over
the
house
infected
me
i
confess
that
i
made
my
little
tour
of
bathroom
and
with
my
revolver
in
my
hand
i
found
nothing
of
course
the
disorder
of
the
house
had
not
extended
itself
here
the
bathroom
was
spotless
with
white
tile
the
large
which
opened
off
the
passage
between
the
two
rooms
was
full
of
neatly
folded
clothing
for
the
children
the
closet
was
to
play
its
part
later
a
darkish
little
room
faintly
lighted
by
a
ground
glass
transom
opening
into
the
center
hall
but
dependent
mostly
on
electric
light
outside
the
windows
reed
had
asked
me
not
to
open
was
a
roof
almost
level
with
the
sills
then
was
it
an
outside
intruder
she
feared
and
in
that
case
why
the
bolts
on
the
outside
of
the
two
nursery
doors
for
the
night
nursery
i
found
must
have
one
also
i
turned
the
key
but
the
door
would
not
open
i
decided
not
to
try
to
sleep
that
night
but
to
keep
on
watch
so
powerfully
had
the
mother
s
anxiety
about
her
children
and
their
mysterious
danger
impressed
me
that
i
made
frequent
excursions
into
the
back
room
up
to
midnight
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
alarm
me
i
darkened
both
rooms
and
sat
waiting
for
i
know
not
what
for
some
sound
to
show
that
the
house
stirred
perhaps
at
a
few
minutes
after
twelve
faint
noises
penetrated
to
my
room
from
the
hall
reed
s
nervous
voice
and
a
piece
of
furniture
scraping
over
the
floor
then
silence
again
for
half
an
hour
or
so
was
quite
certain
that
the
bolt
on
my
door
had
been
shot
i
did
not
hear
it
i
think
perhaps
i
felt
it
perhaps
i
only
feared
it
i
unlocked
the
door
it
was
fastened
outside
there
is
a
hideous
feeling
of
helplessness
about
being
locked
in
i
pretended
to
myself
at
first
that
i
was
only
interested
and
curious
but
i
was
frightened
i
know
that
now
i
sat
there
in
the
dark
and
wondered
what
i
would
do
if
the
house
took
fire
or
if
some
hideous
tragedy
enacted
itself
outside
that
locked
door
and
i
were
helpless
by
two
o
clock
i
had
worked
myself
into
a
panic
the
house
was
no
longer
silent
some
one
was
moving
about
downstairs
and
not
stealthily
the
sounds
came
up
through
the
heavy
joists
and
flooring
of
the
old
house
i
determined
to
make
at
least
a
struggle
to
free
myself
there
was
no
way
to
get
at
the
bolts
of
course
the
roof
remained
and
the
transom
in
the
true
i
might
have
raised
an
alarm
and
been
freed
at
once
but
naturally
i
rejected
this
method
the
roof
of
the
proved
impracticable
the
tin
bent
and
cracked
under
my
first
step
the
transom
then
i
carried
a
chair
into
the
closet
and
found
the
transom
easy
to
lower
but
it
threatened
to
creak
i
put
liquid
soap
on
the
was
all
i
had
and
it
worked
very
lowered
the
transom
inch
by
inch
even
then
i
could
not
see
over
it
i
had
worked
so
far
without
a
sound
but
in
climbing
to
a
shelf
my
foot
slipped
and
i
thought
i
heard
a
sharp
movement
outside
it
was
five
minutes
before
i
stirred
i
hung
there
every
muscle
cramped
listening
and
waiting
then
i
lifted
myself
by
sheer
force
of
muscle
and
looked
out
the
upper
landing
of
the
staircase
brilliantly
lighted
was
to
my
right
across
the
head
of
the
stairs
had
been
pushed
a
cotbed
made
up
for
the
night
but
it
was
unoccupied
reed
in
a
long
dark
ulster
was
standing
beside
it
staring
with
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
at
something
in
the
lower
hall
iii
some
time
after
four
o
clock
my
door
was
unlocked
from
without
the
bolt
slipped
as
noiselessly
as
it
had
been
shot
i
got
a
little
sleep
until
seven
when
the
boys
trotted
into
my
room
in
their
bathrobes
and
slippers
and
perched
on
my
bed
it
s
a
nice
day
observed
harry
the
elder
is
that
bump
your
feet
i
wriggled
my
toes
and
assured
him
he
had
surmised
correctly
you
re
pretty
long
aren
t
you
do
you
think
we
can
play
in
the
fountain
we
ll
make
a
try
for
it
son
it
will
do
us
all
good
to
get
out
into
the
we
always
took
chang
for
a
walk
every
day
mademoiselle
and
chang
and
freddie
and
freddie
had
found
my
cap
on
the
dressing
table
and
had
put
it
on
his
yellow
head
but
now
on
hearing
the
beloved
name
of
his
pet
he
burst
into
loud
howls
want
mam
selle
he
cried
want
chang
too
poor
freddie
the
children
were
adorable
i
bathed
and
dressed
them
and
mindful
of
my
predecessor
s
story
of
crackers
and
milk
prepared
for
an
excursion
kitchenward
the
nights
might
be
full
of
mystery
murder
might
romp
from
room
to
room
but
i
intended
to
see
that
the
youngsters
breakfasted
but
before
i
was
ready
to
go
down
breakfast
arrived
perhaps
the
other
nurse
had
told
the
reeds
a
few
plain
truths
before
she
left
perhaps
and
this
i
think
was
the
case
the
cloud
had
lifted
just
a
little
whatever
it
may
have
been
two
rather
flushed
and
blistered
young
people
tapped
at
the
door
that
morning
and
were
admitted
reed
first
with
a
tray
reed
following
with
a
and
cream
the
little
nursery
table
was
small
for
five
but
we
made
room
somehow
what
if
the
eggs
were
underdone
and
the
toast
dry
the
children
munched
blissfully
what
if
reed
s
face
was
still
drawn
and
haggard
and
his
wife
a
limp
little
huddle
on
the
floor
she
sat
with
her
head
against
his
knee
and
her
eyes
on
the
little
boys
and
drank
her
pale
coffee
slowly
she
was
very
tired
poor
thing
she
dropped
asleep
sitting
there
and
he
sat
for
a
long
time
not
liking
to
disturb
her
it
made
me
feel
homesick
for
the
home
i
didn
t
have
i
ve
had
the
same
feeling
before
of
being
a
rank
outsider
a
sort
of
defrauded
feeling
i
ve
had
it
when
i
ve
seen
the
look
in
a
man
s
eyes
when
his
wife
after
an
operation
and
i
ve
had
it
for
that
matter
when
i
ve
put
a
new
baby
in
its
mother
s
arms
for
the
first
time
i
had
it
for
sure
that
morning
while
she
slept
there
and
he
stroked
her
pretty
hair
i
put
in
my
plea
for
the
children
then
it
s
bright
and
sunny
i
argued
and
if
you
are
nervous
i
ll
keep
them
away
from
other
children
but
if
you
want
to
keep
them
well
you
must
give
them
it
was
the
argument
about
keeping
them
well
that
influenced
him
i
think
he
sat
silent
for
a
long
time
his
wife
was
still
asleep
her
lips
parted
very
well
he
said
finally
from
two
to
three
miss
adams
but
not
in
the
garden
back
of
the
house
take
them
on
the
i
agreed
to
that
i
shall
want
a
short
walk
every
evening
myself
i
added
that
is
a
rule
of
mine
i
am
a
more
useful
person
and
a
more
agreeable
one
if
i
have
i
think
he
would
have
demurred
if
he
dared
but
one
does
not
easily
deny
so
sane
a
request
he
yielded
grudgingly
that
first
day
was
calm
and
quiet
enough
had
it
not
been
for
the
strange
condition
of
the
house
and
the
necessity
for
keeping
the
children
locked
in
i
would
have
smiled
at
my
terror
of
the
night
luncheon
was
sent
in
so
was
dinner
the
children
and
i
lunched
and
supped
alone
as
far
as
i
could
see
reed
made
no
attempt
at
housework
but
the
cot
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
disappeared
in
the
early
morning
and
the
dog
did
not
howl
again
i
took
the
boys
out
for
an
hour
in
the
early
afternoon
two
incidents
occurred
both
of
them
significant
i
bought
myself
a
screw
was
one
the
other
was
our
meeting
with
a
slender
young
woman
in
black
who
knew
the
boys
and
stopped
them
she
proved
to
be
one
of
the
dismissed
waitress
she
said
why
freddie
she
cried
and
harry
too
aren
t
you
going
to
speak
to
nora
after
a
moment
or
two
she
turned
to
me
and
i
felt
she
wanted
to
say
something
but
hardly
dared
how
is
reed
she
asked
not
sick
i
hope
she
glanced
at
my
luke
s
cloak
and
bonnet
no
she
is
quite
and
reed
quite
well
is
mademoiselle
still
there
no
there
is
no
one
there
but
the
family
there
are
no
maids
in
the
she
stared
at
me
curiously
mademoiselle
has
gone
are
you
excuse
me
miss
but
i
thought
she
would
never
go
the
children
were
like
her
she
is
not
there
she
stood
for
a
moment
debating
i
thought
then
she
burst
out
mr
reed
made
a
mistake
miss
you
can
t
take
a
houseful
of
servants
and
dismiss
them
the
way
he
did
without
half
an
hour
to
get
out
bag
and
baggage
without
making
talk
and
there
s
talk
enough
all
through
the
what
sort
of
talk
different
people
say
different
things
they
say
mademoiselle
is
still
there
locked
in
her
room
on
the
third
floor
there
s
a
light
there
sometimes
but
nobody
sees
her
and
other
folks
say
reed
is
crazy
and
there
is
worse
being
said
than
but
she
refused
to
tell
me
any
concluded
she
had
said
too
much
and
got
away
as
quickly
as
she
could
looking
rather
worried
i
was
a
trifle
over
my
hour
getting
back
but
nothing
was
said
to
leave
the
clean
and
tidy
street
for
the
disordered
house
was
not
pleasant
but
once
in
the
children
s
suite
with
the
goldfish
in
the
aquarium
darting
like
tongues
of
flame
in
the
sunlight
with
the
tulips
and
hyacinths
of
the
glowing
and
the
orderly
toys
on
their
white
shelves
i
felt
comforted
after
all
disorder
and
dust
did
not
imply
crime
but
one
thing
i
did
that
it
with
firmness
and
no
attempt
at
secrecy
and
after
asking
permission
of
no
one
i
took
the
new
screw
driver
and
unfastened
the
bolt
from
the
outside
of
my
door
i
was
prepared
if
necessary
to
make
a
stand
on
that
issue
but
although
it
was
noticed
i
knew
no
mention
of
it
was
made
to
me
reed
pleaded
a
headache
that
evening
and
i
believe
her
husband
ate
alone
in
the
dismantled
dining
room
for
every
room
on
the
lower
floor
i
had
discovered
was
in
the
same
curious
disorder
at
seven
reed
relieved
me
to
go
out
the
children
were
in
bed
he
did
not
go
into
the
day
nursery
but
placed
a
straight
chair
outside
the
door
of
the
back
room
and
sat
there
bent
over
elbows
on
knees
chin
cupped
in
his
palm
staring
at
the
staircase
he
roused
enough
to
ask
me
to
bring
an
evening
paper
when
i
returned
when
i
am
on
a
department
case
i
always
take
my
in
the
evening
by
arrangement
and
walk
round
the
block
some
time
in
my
walk
i
am
sure
to
see
patton
himself
if
the
case
is
big
enough
or
one
of
his
agents
if
he
can
not
come
if
i
have
nothing
to
communicate
it
resolves
itself
into
a
bow
and
nothing
more
i
was
nervous
on
this
particular
jaunt
for
one
thing
my
luke
s
cloak
and
bonnet
marked
me
at
once
made
me
conspicuous
for
another
i
was
afraid
patton
would
think
the
reed
house
no
place
for
a
woman
and
order
me
home
it
was
a
quarter
to
eight
and
quite
dark
before
he
fell
into
step
beside
me
well
i
replied
rather
shakily
i
m
still
alive
as
you
then
it
is
pretty
bad
it
s
exceedingly
queer
i
admitted
and
told
my
story
i
had
meant
to
conceal
the
bolt
on
the
outside
of
my
door
and
one
or
two
other
things
but
i
blurted
them
all
out
right
then
and
there
and
felt
a
lot
better
at
once
he
listened
intently
it
s
fear
of
the
deadliest
sort
i
finished
fear
of
the
police
think
not
it
is
fear
of
something
in
the
house
they
are
always
listening
and
watching
at
the
top
of
the
front
stairs
they
have
lifted
all
the
carpets
so
that
every
footstep
echoes
through
the
whole
house
reed
goes
down
to
the
first
door
but
never
alone
i
found
that
the
back
staircase
is
locked
off
at
top
and
bottom
there
are
i
gave
him
my
rough
diagram
of
the
house
it
was
too
dark
to
see
it
it
is
only
tentative
i
explained
so
much
of
the
house
is
locked
up
and
every
movement
of
mine
is
under
surveillance
without
baths
there
are
about
twelve
large
rooms
counting
the
third
floor
i
ve
not
been
able
to
get
there
but
i
thought
that
i
d
try
to
look
you
had
no
sleep
last
night
three
four
to
seven
this
we
had
crossed
into
the
public
square
and
were
walking
slowly
under
the
trees
now
he
stopped
and
faced
me
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
it
miss
adams
he
said
ordinary
panic
goes
and
hides
but
here
s
a
fear
that
knows
what
it
s
afraid
of
and
takes
methodical
steps
for
protection
i
didn
t
want
you
to
take
the
case
you
know
that
but
now
i
m
not
going
to
insult
you
by
asking
you
to
give
it
up
but
i
m
going
to
see
that
you
are
protected
there
will
be
some
one
across
the
street
every
night
as
long
as
you
are
in
the
have
you
any
theory
i
asked
him
he
is
not
strong
for
theories
generally
he
is
very
practical
that
is
do
you
think
the
other
nurse
was
right
and
there
is
some
sort
of
crime
being
concealed
well
think
about
it
he
prompted
me
if
a
murder
has
been
committed
what
are
they
afraid
of
the
police
then
why
a
trained
nurse
and
all
this
caution
about
the
children
a
ghost
would
they
lift
the
carpets
so
that
they
could
hear
the
specter
tramping
about
if
there
is
no
crime
but
lunatic
perhaps
i
asked
possibly
but
then
why
this
secrecy
and
keeping
out
the
police
it
is
of
course
possible
that
your
respected
employers
have
both
gone
off
mentally
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
nightmare
delusion
on
my
word
it
sounds
like
it
but
it
s
too
much
for
credulity
to
believe
they
ve
both
gone
crazy
with
the
same
form
of
perhaps
i
m
the
lunatic
i
said
despairingly
when
you
reduce
it
like
that
to
an
absurdity
i
wonder
if
i
didn
t
imagine
it
all
the
lights
burning
everywhere
and
the
carpets
up
and
reed
staring
down
the
staircase
and
i
locked
in
a
room
and
hanging
on
by
my
nails
to
peer
out
through
a
closet
perhaps
but
how
about
the
deadly
sane
young
woman
who
preceded
you
she
had
no
imagination
now
about
reed
and
his
do
they
strike
you
they
get
along
all
right
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
suppose
they
are
nice
people
i
said
emphatically
he
s
a
gentleman
and
they
re
devoted
he
just
looks
like
a
big
boy
who
s
got
into
an
awful
mess
and
doesn
t
know
how
to
get
out
and
she
s
backing
him
up
she
s
a
humph
said
patton
don
t
suppress
any
evidence
because
she
s
a
dear
and
he
s
a
handsome
big
boy
i
didn
t
say
he
was
handsome
i
snapped
did
you
ever
see
a
ghost
or
think
you
saw
one
he
inquired
suddenly
no
but
one
of
my
aunts
has
hers
always
carry
their
heads
she
asked
one
a
question
once
and
the
head
then
you
believe
in
things
of
that
sort
not
a
i
m
afraid
of
he
smiled
and
shortly
after
that
i
went
back
to
the
house
i
think
he
was
sorry
about
the
ghost
question
for
he
explained
that
he
had
been
trying
me
out
and
that
i
looked
well
in
my
cloak
and
bonnet
i
m
afraid
of
your
chin
generally
he
said
but
the
white
lawn
ties
have
a
softening
effect
in
view
of
the
ties
i
have
almost
the
yes
i
think
not
after
he
decided
the
chin
is
there
ties
or
no
ties
heaven
s
sake
don
t
run
any
unnecessary
the
change
from
his
facetious
tone
to
earnestness
was
so
unexpected
that
i
was
still
standing
there
on
the
pavement
when
he
plunged
into
the
darkness
of
the
square
and
disappeared
iv
at
ten
minutes
after
eight
i
was
back
in
the
house
reed
admitted
me
going
through
the
tedious
process
of
unlocking
outer
and
inner
vestibule
doors
and
fastening
them
again
behind
me
he
inquired
politely
if
i
had
had
a
pleasant
walk
and
without
waiting
for
my
reply
fell
to
reading
the
evening
paper
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
me
absolutely
first
he
scanned
the
headlines
then
he
turned
feverishly
to
something
farther
on
and
ran
his
fingers
down
along
a
column
his
lips
were
twitching
but
evidently
he
did
not
find
what
he
he
threw
the
paper
away
and
did
not
glance
at
it
again
i
watched
him
from
the
angle
of
the
stairs
even
for
that
short
interval
reed
had
taken
his
place
at
the
children
s
door
she
wore
a
black
dress
long
sleeved
and
high
at
the
throat
instead
of
the
silk
negligee
of
the
previous
evening
and
she
held
a
book
but
she
was
not
reading
she
smiled
rather
wistfully
when
she
saw
me
how
fresh
you
always
look
she
said
and
so
i
wish
i
had
your
i
am
perfectly
well
i
dare
say
that
explains
a
lot
kiddies
asleep
freddie
isn
t
he
has
been
crying
for
chang
i
hate
night
miss
adams
i
m
like
freddie
all
my
troubles
come
up
about
this
time
i
m
horribly
her
blue
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
haven
t
been
sleeping
well
she
confessed
i
should
think
not
without
taking
off
my
things
i
went
down
to
reed
in
the
lower
hall
i
m
going
to
insist
on
something
i
said
mrs
reed
is
highly
nervous
she
says
she
has
not
been
sleeping
i
think
if
i
give
her
an
opiate
and
she
gets
an
entire
night
s
sleep
it
may
save
her
a
i
looked
straight
in
his
eyes
and
for
once
he
did
evade
me
i
m
afraid
i
ve
been
very
selfish
he
said
of
course
she
must
have
sleep
i
ll
give
you
a
powder
unless
you
have
something
you
prefer
to
i
remembered
then
that
he
was
a
chemist
and
said
i
would
gladly
use
whatever
he
gave
me
there
is
another
thing
i
wanted
to
speak
about
reed
i
said
the
children
are
mourning
their
dog
don
t
you
think
he
may
have
been
accidentally
shut
up
somewhere
in
the
house
in
one
of
the
upper
floors
why
do
you
say
that
he
demanded
sharply
they
say
they
have
heard
him
he
hesitated
for
barely
a
moment
then
possibly
he
said
but
they
will
not
hear
him
again
the
little
chap
has
been
sick
and
of
course
the
boys
are
not
to
no
one
watched
the
staircase
that
night
i
gave
reed
the
opiate
and
saw
her
comfortably
into
bed
when
i
went
back
fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
resting
but
not
asleep
opiates
sometimes
make
people
garrulous
for
a
little
comfort
perhaps
and
relaxed
tension
i
ve
had
stockbrokers
and
bankers
in
the
hospital
give
me
tips
after
a
hypodermic
of
morphia
that
would
have
made
me
wealthy
had
i
not
been
limited
to
my
training
allowance
of
twelve
dollars
a
month
i
was
just
wondering
she
said
as
i
tucked
her
up
where
a
woman
owes
the
most
her
husband
or
to
her
children
why
not
split
it
up
i
said
cheerfully
and
try
doing
what
seems
best
for
both
but
that
s
only
a
compromise
she
complained
and
was
asleep
almost
immediately
i
lowered
the
light
and
closed
the
door
and
shortly
after
i
heard
reed
locking
it
from
the
outside
with
the
bolt
off
my
door
and
reed
asleep
my
plan
for
the
night
was
easily
carried
out
i
went
to
bed
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
slept
calmly
i
awakened
once
with
the
feeling
that
some
one
was
looking
at
me
from
the
passage
into
the
night
nursery
but
there
was
no
one
there
however
so
strong
had
been
the
feeling
that
i
got
up
and
went
into
the
back
room
the
children
were
asleep
and
all
doors
opening
into
the
hall
were
locked
but
the
window
on
to
the
roof
was
open
and
the
curtain
blowing
there
was
no
one
on
the
roof
it
was
not
twelve
o
clock
and
i
still
had
an
hour
i
went
back
to
bed
at
one
i
prepared
to
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
looking
from
one
of
my
windows
i
thought
i
saw
the
shadowy
figure
of
a
man
across
the
street
and
i
was
comforted
help
was
always
close
i
felt
and
yet
as
i
stood
inside
my
door
in
my
shoes
with
my
ulster
over
my
uniform
and
a
revolver
and
my
skeleton
keys
in
my
pockets
my
heart
was
going
very
fast
the
stupid
story
of
the
ghost
came
back
and
made
me
shudder
and
the
next
instant
i
was
remembering
reed
the
night
before
staring
down
into
the
lower
hall
with
fixed
glassy
eyes
my
plan
was
to
begin
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
work
down
the
thing
was
the
more
hazardous
of
course
because
reed
was
most
certainly
somewhere
about
i
had
no
excuse
for
being
on
the
third
floor
down
below
i
could
say
i
wanted
tea
or
hot
but
i
did
not
expect
to
find
reed
up
above
the
terror
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
lie
below
access
to
the
third
floor
was
not
easy
the
main
staircase
did
not
go
up
to
get
there
i
was
obliged
to
unlock
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
with
my
own
keys
i
was
working
in
bright
light
trying
my
keys
one
after
another
and
watching
over
my
shoulder
as
i
did
so
when
the
door
finally
gave
it
was
a
relief
to
slip
into
the
darkness
beyond
ghosts
or
no
ghosts
i
am
always
a
silent
worker
caution
about
closing
doors
and
squeaking
hinges
is
second
nature
to
me
one
learns
to
be
cautious
when
one
s
only
chance
of
sleep
is
not
to
rouse
a
peevish
patient
and
have
to
give
a
as
like
as
not
or
listen
to
domestic
i
said
and
he
said
one
is
almost
crazy
so
i
made
no
noise
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
stood
blinking
in
the
darkness
i
listened
there
was
no
sound
above
or
below
now
houses
at
night
have
no
terror
for
me
every
nurse
is
obliged
to
do
more
or
less
going
about
in
the
dark
but
i
was
not
easy
suppose
reed
should
call
me
true
i
had
locked
my
door
and
had
the
key
in
my
pocket
but
a
dozen
emergencies
flew
through
my
mind
as
i
felt
for
the
stair
rail
there
was
a
curious
odor
through
all
the
back
staircase
a
pungent
aromatic
scent
that
with
all
my
familiarity
with
drugs
was
strange
to
me
as
i
slowly
climbed
the
stairs
it
grew
more
powerful
the
air
was
heavy
with
it
as
though
no
windows
had
been
opened
in
that
part
of
the
house
there
was
no
door
at
the
top
of
this
staircase
as
there
was
on
the
second
floor
it
opened
into
an
upper
hall
and
across
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
a
door
leading
into
a
room
this
door
was
closed
on
this
staircase
as
on
all
the
others
the
carpet
had
been
newly
lifted
my
electric
flash
showed
the
white
boards
and
painted
borders
the
carpet
tacks
many
of
them
still
in
place
one
lying
loose
penetrated
my
rubber
sole
and
went
into
my
foot
i
sat
down
in
the
dark
and
took
off
the
shoe
as
i
did
so
my
flash
on
the
step
beside
me
rolled
over
and
down
with
a
crash
i
caught
it
on
the
next
step
but
the
noise
had
been
like
a
pistol
shot
almost
immediately
a
voice
spoke
above
me
sharply
at
first
i
thought
it
was
out
in
the
upper
hall
then
i
realized
that
the
closed
door
was
between
it
and
me
ees
that
you
meester
reed
mademoiselle
meester
reed
plaintively
eet
comes
up
again
meester
reed
i
die
i
die
she
listened
on
no
reply
coming
she
began
to
groan
rhythmically
to
a
curious
accompaniment
of
creaking
when
i
had
gathered
up
my
nerves
again
i
realized
that
she
must
be
sitting
in
a
rocking
chair
the
groans
were
really
little
plaintive
grunts
by
the
time
i
had
got
my
shoe
on
she
was
up
again
and
i
could
hear
her
pacing
the
room
the
heavy
step
of
a
woman
well
fleshed
and
not
young
now
and
then
she
stopped
inside
the
door
and
listened
once
she
shook
the
knob
and
mumbled
querulously
to
herself
i
recovered
the
flash
and
with
infinite
caution
worked
my
way
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
mademoiselle
was
locked
in
doubly
bolted
in
two
strong
bolts
above
and
below
supplemented
the
door
lock
her
ears
must
have
been
very
quick
or
else
she
felt
my
softly
padding
feet
on
the
boards
outside
for
suddenly
she
flung
herself
against
the
door
and
begged
for
a
priest
begged
piteously
in
jumbled
french
and
english
she
wanted
food
she
was
dying
of
hunger
she
wanted
a
priest
and
all
the
while
i
stood
outside
the
door
and
wondered
what
i
should
do
should
i
release
the
woman
should
i
go
down
to
the
lower
floor
and
get
the
detective
across
the
street
to
come
in
and
force
the
door
was
this
the
terror
that
held
the
house
in
babbling
old
frenchwoman
calling
for
food
and
a
priest
in
one
breath
surely
not
this
was
a
part
of
the
mystery
not
all
the
real
terror
lay
below
it
was
not
mademoiselle
locked
in
her
room
on
the
upper
floor
that
the
reeds
waited
for
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
but
why
was
mademoiselle
locked
in
her
room
why
were
the
children
locked
in
what
was
this
thing
that
had
turned
a
home
into
a
jail
a
barracks
that
had
sent
away
the
servants
imprisoned
and
probably
killed
the
dog
sapped
the
joy
of
life
from
two
young
people
what
was
it
that
mademoiselle
cried
comes
up
again
i
looked
toward
the
staircase
was
it
coming
up
the
staircase
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
thing
i
can
see
but
it
seemed
to
me
all
at
once
that
if
anything
was
going
to
come
up
the
staircase
i
might
as
well
get
down
first
a
staircase
is
no
place
to
meet
anything
especially
if
one
doesn
t
know
what
it
is
i
listened
again
mademoiselle
was
quiet
i
flashed
my
light
down
the
narrow
stairs
they
were
quite
empty
i
shut
off
the
flash
and
went
down
i
tried
to
go
slowly
to
retreat
with
dignity
and
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
landing
below
i
was
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
was
this
shivering
girl
the
young
woman
patton
called
his
right
hand
i
dare
say
i
should
have
stopped
there
for
that
night
at
least
my
nerves
were
frayed
but
i
forced
myself
on
the
mystery
lay
below
well
then
i
was
going
down
it
could
not
be
so
terrible
at
least
it
was
nothing
supernatural
there
must
be
a
natural
explanation
and
then
that
silly
story
about
the
headless
things
must
pop
into
my
head
and
start
me
down
trembling
the
lower
rear
staircase
was
black
dark
like
the
upper
but
just
at
the
foot
a
light
came
in
through
a
barred
window
i
could
see
it
plainly
and
the
shadows
of
the
iron
grating
on
the
bare
floor
i
stood
there
listening
there
was
not
a
sound
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
exactly
what
followed
i
stood
there
with
my
hand
on
the
rail
i
d
been
very
silent
my
rubber
shoes
attended
to
that
and
one
moment
the
staircase
was
clear
with
a
patch
of
light
at
the
bottom
the
next
something
was
there
half
way
head
it
seemed
to
be
with
a
pointed
hood
like
a
monk
s
cowl
there
was
no
body
it
seemed
to
lie
at
my
feet
but
it
was
living
it
moved
i
could
tell
the
moment
when
the
eyes
lifted
and
saw
my
feet
the
slow
of
the
head
as
they
followed
up
my
body
all
the
air
was
squeezed
out
of
my
lungs
a
heavy
hand
seemed
to
press
on
my
chest
i
remember
raising
a
shaking
hand
and
flinging
my
flashlight
at
the
head
the
flash
clattered
on
the
stair
tread
harmless
then
the
head
was
gone
and
something
living
slid
over
my
foot
i
stumbled
back
to
my
room
and
locked
the
door
it
was
two
hours
before
i
had
strength
enough
to
get
my
aromatic
ammonia
bottle
v
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
hardly
dropped
asleep
before
the
children
were
in
the
room
clamoring
the
goldfish
are
dead
harry
said
standing
soberly
by
the
bed
they
are
all
dead
with
their
stummicks
turned
i
sat
up
my
head
ached
violently
they
can
t
be
dead
old
i
was
feeling
about
for
my
kimono
but
i
remembered
that
when
i
had
found
my
way
back
to
the
nursery
after
my
fright
on
the
back
stairs
i
had
lain
down
in
my
uniform
i
crawled
out
hardly
able
to
stand
we
gave
them
fresh
water
yesterday
i
had
got
to
the
aquarium
harry
was
right
the
little
darting
flames
of
pink
and
gold
were
still
they
floated
about
rolling
gently
as
freddie
prodded
them
with
a
forefinger
dull
eyed
pale
bellies
upturned
in
his
cage
above
the
little
parrot
watched
out
of
a
crooked
eye
i
ran
to
the
medicine
closet
in
the
bathroom
freddie
had
a
weakness
for
administering
medicine
i
had
only
just
rescued
the
parrot
from
the
result
of
his
curiosity
and
a
headache
tablet
the
day
before
what
did
you
give
them
i
demanded
bread
said
freddie
stoutly
only
bread
dirty
bread
harry
put
in
i
told
him
it
was
where
did
you
get
it
on
the
roof
of
the
shade
of
montessori
the
rascals
had
been
out
on
that
sloping
tin
roof
it
turned
me
rather
sick
to
think
of
it
accused
they
admitted
it
frankly
i
unlocked
the
window
harry
said
and
freddie
got
the
bread
it
was
out
in
the
gutter
he
slipped
almost
went
over
and
made
a
squash
on
the
pavement
added
freddie
we
gave
the
little
fishes
the
bread
for
breakfast
and
now
they
re
gone
to
the
bread
had
contained
poison
of
course
even
the
two
little
snails
that
crawled
over
the
sand
in
the
aquarium
were
motionless
i
sniffed
the
water
it
had
a
slightly
foreign
odor
i
did
not
recognize
it
panic
seized
me
then
i
wanted
to
get
away
and
take
the
children
with
me
the
situation
was
too
hideous
but
it
was
still
early
i
could
only
wait
until
the
family
roused
in
the
meantime
however
i
made
a
excursion
out
on
to
the
tin
roof
and
down
to
the
gutter
there
was
no
more
of
the
bread
there
the
was
at
the
side
of
the
house
as
i
stood
balancing
myself
perilously
on
the
edge
summoning
my
courage
to
climb
back
to
the
window
above
i
suddenly
remembered
the
guard
patton
had
promised
and
glanced
toward
the
square
the
guard
was
still
there
more
than
that
he
was
running
across
the
street
toward
me
it
was
patton
himself
he
brought
up
between
the
two
houses
with
absolute
fury
in
his
face
go
back
he
waved
what
are
you
doing
out
there
anyhow
that
roof
s
as
slippery
as
the
devil
i
turned
meekly
and
crawled
back
with
as
much
dignity
as
i
could
i
did
not
say
anything
there
was
nothing
i
could
bawl
from
the
roof
i
could
only
close
and
lock
the
window
and
hope
that
the
people
in
the
next
house
still
slept
patton
must
have
gone
shortly
after
for
i
did
not
see
him
again
i
wondered
if
he
had
relieved
the
night
watch
or
if
he
could
possibly
have
been
on
guard
himself
all
that
chilly
april
night
reed
did
not
breakfast
with
us
i
made
a
point
of
being
cheerful
before
the
children
and
their
mother
was
rested
and
brighter
than
i
had
seen
her
but
more
than
once
i
found
her
staring
at
me
in
a
puzzled
way
she
asked
me
if
i
had
slept
i
wakened
only
once
she
said
i
thought
i
heard
a
crash
of
some
sort
did
you
hear
it
what
sort
of
a
crash
i
evaded
the
children
had
forgotten
the
goldfish
for
a
time
now
they
remembered
and
clamored
their
news
to
her
dead
she
said
and
looked
at
me
poisoned
i
explained
i
shall
nail
the
windows
over
the
shut
reed
the
boys
got
out
there
early
this
morning
and
picked
up
i
believe
they
fed
it
to
the
fish
are
all
the
light
went
out
of
her
face
she
looked
tired
and
harassed
as
she
got
up
i
wanted
to
nail
the
window
she
said
vaguely
but
suppose
they
had
eaten
that
bread
miss
adams
instead
of
giving
it
to
the
fish
the
same
thought
had
chilled
me
with
horror
we
gazed
at
each
other
over
the
unconscious
heads
of
the
children
and
my
heart
ached
for
her
i
made
a
sudden
resolution
when
i
first
came
i
said
to
her
i
told
you
i
wanted
to
help
that
s
what
i
m
here
for
but
how
am
i
to
help
either
you
or
the
children
when
i
do
not
know
what
danger
it
is
that
threatens
it
isn
t
fair
to
you
or
to
them
or
even
to
she
was
much
shaken
by
the
poison
incident
i
thought
she
wavered
are
you
afraid
the
children
will
be
stolen
oh
or
hurt
in
any
way
i
was
thinking
of
the
bread
on
the
roof
but
you
are
afraid
of
something
harry
looked
up
suddenly
mother
s
never
afraid
he
said
stoutly
i
sent
them
both
in
to
see
if
the
fish
were
still
dead
there
is
something
in
the
house
downstairs
that
you
are
afraid
of
i
persisted
she
took
a
step
forward
and
caught
my
arm
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
like
this
miss
adams
i
m
dying
of
fear
i
had
a
quick
vision
of
the
swathed
head
on
the
back
staircase
and
some
of
my
night
s
terror
came
back
to
me
i
believe
we
stared
at
each
other
with
dilated
pupils
for
a
moment
then
i
asked
is
it
a
real
thing
you
can
tell
me
this
are
you
afraid
of
a
reality
it
something
supernatural
i
was
ashamed
of
the
question
it
sounded
so
absurd
in
the
broad
light
of
that
april
morning
it
is
a
real
danger
she
replied
then
i
think
she
decided
that
she
had
gone
as
far
as
she
dared
and
i
went
through
the
ceremony
of
letting
her
out
and
of
locking
the
door
behind
her
the
day
was
warm
i
threw
up
some
of
the
windows
and
the
boys
and
i
played
ball
using
a
rolled
handkerchief
my
part
being
to
sit
on
the
floor
with
a
newspaper
folded
into
a
bat
and
to
bang
at
the
handkerchief
as
it
flew
past
me
became
automatic
after
a
time
as
i
look
back
i
see
a
pair
of
disordered
young
rascals
in
russian
blouses
and
bare
round
knees
doing
a
great
deal
of
yelling
and
some
very
crooked
throwing
a
nurse
sitting
tailor
fashion
on
the
floor
alternately
ducking
to
save
her
cap
and
making
vigorous
but
ineffectual
passes
at
the
ball
with
her
newspaper
bat
and
i
see
sunshine
in
the
room
and
the
dwarf
parrot
eating
sugar
out
of
his
claw
and
below
the
fish
in
the
aquarium
floating
with
dull
eyes
reed
brought
up
our
luncheon
tray
he
looked
tired
and
depressed
and
avoided
my
eyes
i
watched
him
while
i
spread
the
bread
and
butter
for
the
children
he
nailed
shut
the
windows
that
opened
on
to
the
roof
and
when
he
thought
i
was
not
looking
he
examined
the
registers
in
the
wall
to
see
if
the
gratings
were
closed
the
boys
put
the
dead
fish
in
a
box
and
made
him
promise
a
decent
interment
in
the
garden
they
called
on
me
for
an
epitaph
and
i
scrawled
on
top
of
the
box
fish
are
dead
because
a
boy
called
fred
went
out
on
a
porch
roof
when
he
should
have
been
in
i
was
much
pleased
with
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
an
epitaph
which
can
do
no
good
to
the
departed
should
at
least
convey
a
moral
but
to
my
horror
freddie
broke
into
loud
wails
and
would
not
be
comforted
it
was
three
o
clock
therefore
before
they
were
both
settled
for
their
afternoon
naps
and
i
was
free
i
had
determined
to
do
one
thing
and
to
do
it
in
examine
the
back
staircase
inch
by
inch
i
knew
i
would
be
courting
discovery
but
the
thing
had
to
be
done
and
no
power
on
earth
would
have
made
me
essay
such
an
investigation
after
dark
it
was
all
well
enough
for
me
to
say
to
myself
that
there
was
a
natural
explanation
that
this
had
been
a
human
head
of
a
certainty
that
something
living
and
not
spectral
had
slid
over
my
foot
in
the
darkness
i
would
not
have
gone
back
there
again
at
night
for
youth
love
or
money
but
i
did
not
investigate
the
staircase
that
day
after
all
i
made
a
curious
discovery
after
the
boys
had
settled
down
in
their
small
white
beds
a
venturesome
fly
had
sailed
in
through
an
open
window
and
i
was
immediately
in
pursuit
of
him
with
my
paper
bat
driven
from
the
cornice
to
the
chandelier
harried
here
swatted
there
finally
he
took
refuge
inside
the
furnace
register
perhaps
it
is
my
used
to
know
how
many
million
germs
a
fly
packed
about
with
it
and
the
generous
benevolence
with
which
it
distributed
them
i
ve
the
sight
of
a
single
fly
maddens
me
i
said
that
to
patton
once
and
he
asked
what
the
sight
of
a
married
one
would
do
so
i
sat
down
by
the
register
and
waited
it
was
then
that
i
made
the
curious
discovery
that
the
furnace
belowstairs
was
burning
and
burning
hard
a
fierce
heat
assailed
me
as
i
opened
the
grating
i
drove
the
fly
out
of
cover
but
i
had
no
time
for
him
the
furnace
going
full
on
a
warm
spring
day
it
was
strange
perhaps
i
was
stupid
perhaps
the
whole
thing
should
have
been
clear
to
me
but
it
was
not
i
sat
there
bewildered
and
tried
to
figure
it
out
i
went
over
it
point
by
point
the
carpets
up
all
over
the
house
lights
going
full
all
night
and
doors
locked
the
cot
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
reed
staring
down
the
bolt
outside
my
door
to
lock
me
in
the
death
of
chang
mademoiselle
locked
in
her
room
upstairs
and
begging
for
a
priest
the
poison
on
the
porch
roof
the
head
without
a
body
on
the
staircase
and
the
thing
that
slid
over
my
foot
the
furnace
going
and
the
thing
i
recognized
as
i
sat
there
beside
the
unmistakable
odor
of
burning
cloth
should
i
have
known
i
wonder
it
looks
so
clear
to
me
now
i
did
not
investigate
the
staircase
for
the
simple
reason
that
my
skeleton
key
which
unfastened
the
lock
of
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
did
not
open
the
door
i
did
not
understand
at
once
and
stood
stupidly
working
with
the
lock
the
door
was
bolted
on
the
other
side
i
wandered
as
aimlessly
as
i
could
down
the
main
staircase
and
tried
the
corresponding
door
on
the
lower
floor
it
too
was
locked
here
was
an
for
sure
as
far
as
i
could
discover
the
only
other
entrance
to
the
back
staircase
was
through
the
window
with
the
iron
grating
as
i
turned
to
go
back
i
saw
my
electric
flash
badly
broken
lying
on
a
table
in
the
hall
i
did
not
claim
it
the
lower
floor
seemed
entirely
deserted
the
drawing
room
and
library
were
in
their
usual
disorder
undusted
and
bare
of
floor
the
air
everywhere
was
close
and
heavy
there
was
not
a
window
open
i
sauntered
through
the
various
rooms
picked
up
a
book
in
the
library
as
an
excuse
and
tried
the
door
of
the
room
behind
it
was
locked
i
thought
at
first
that
something
moved
behind
it
but
if
anything
lived
there
it
did
not
stir
again
and
yet
i
had
a
vivid
impression
that
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
ears
as
keen
as
mine
were
listening
it
was
broad
day
but
i
backed
away
from
the
door
and
out
into
the
wide
hall
my
nerves
were
still
raw
no
doubt
from
the
night
before
i
was
to
meet
patton
at
half
after
seven
that
night
and
when
reed
relieved
me
at
seven
i
had
half
an
hour
to
myself
i
spent
it
in
beauregard
gardens
with
the
dry
fountain
in
the
center
the
place
itself
was
charming
the
trees
still
black
but
lightly
fringed
with
new
green
early
spring
flowers
in
the
borders
neat
paths
and
bordering
it
all
the
solid
dignified
backs
of
the
beauregard
houses
i
sat
down
on
the
coping
of
the
fountain
and
surveyed
the
reed
house
those
windows
above
were
mademoiselle
s
the
shades
were
drawn
but
no
light
came
through
or
round
them
the
prisoner
she
was
by
every
rule
of
bolt
and
be
sitting
in
the
dark
was
she
still
begging
for
her
priest
had
she
had
any
food
was
she
still
listening
inside
her
door
for
whatever
it
was
that
was
coming
up
in
all
the
other
houses
windows
were
open
curtains
waved
gently
in
the
spring
air
the
cheerful
signs
of
the
dinner
hour
were
evident
near
servants
a
gleam
of
stately
shirt
bosom
as
a
butler
mixed
a
salad
a
warm
radiance
of
from
dining
room
tables
and
the
reflected
glow
of
flowers
only
the
reed
house
stood
gloomy
unlighted
almost
sinister
beauregard
place
dined
early
it
was
one
of
the
traditions
i
believe
it
liked
to
get
to
the
theater
or
the
opera
early
and
it
believed
in
allowing
the
servants
a
little
time
in
the
evenings
so
although
it
was
only
something
after
seven
the
evening
rite
of
the
table
crumbs
began
to
be
observed
came
a
colored
butler
bowed
to
me
with
a
word
of
apology
and
dumped
the
contents
of
a
silver
tray
into
the
basin
came
a
pretty
mulatto
flung
her
crumbs
gracefully
and
smiled
with
a
flash
of
teeth
at
the
butler
then
for
five
minutes
i
was
alone
it
was
nora
the
girl
we
had
met
on
the
street
who
came
next
she
saw
me
and
came
round
to
me
with
a
little
air
of
triumph
well
i
m
back
in
the
square
again
after
all
miss
she
said
and
a
better
place
than
the
reeds
i
don
t
have
the
doilies
to
i
m
very
glad
you
are
settled
again
she
lowered
her
voice
i
m
just
trying
it
out
she
observed
the
girl
that
left
said
i
wouldn
t
stay
she
was
scared
off
there
have
been
some
queer
that
i
believe
in
ghosts
or
anything
like
that
but
my
mother
in
the
old
country
had
the
and
if
there
s
anything
going
on
i
ll
be
right
sure
to
see
it
took
encouragement
to
get
her
story
and
it
was
secondhand
at
that
of
course
but
it
appeared
that
a
state
of
panic
had
seized
the
beauregard
servants
the
alarm
was
all
belowstairs
and
had
been
started
by
a
cook
who
coming
in
late
and
going
to
the
basement
to
prepare
herself
a
cup
of
tea
had
found
her
kitchen
door
locked
and
a
light
going
beyond
suspecting
another
maid
of
violating
the
tea
canister
she
had
gone
to
the
outside
of
the
house
and
had
distinctly
seen
a
gray
figure
crouching
in
a
corner
of
the
room
she
had
called
the
butler
and
they
had
made
an
examination
of
the
entire
basement
without
result
nothing
was
missing
from
the
house
and
that
figure
has
been
seen
again
and
again
miss
nora
finished
mckenna
s
butler
joseph
saw
it
in
this
very
spot
walking
without
a
sound
and
the
street
light
beyond
there
shining
straight
through
it
over
in
the
smythe
house
the
laundress
coming
in
late
and
going
down
to
the
basement
to
soak
her
clothes
for
the
morning
met
the
thing
on
the
basement
staircase
and
fainted
dead
i
had
listened
intently
what
do
they
think
it
is
i
asked
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
picked
up
her
tray
i
m
not
trying
to
say
and
i
guess
nobody
is
but
if
there
s
been
a
murder
it
s
pretty
well
known
that
the
ghost
walks
about
until
the
burial
service
is
read
and
it
s
properly
she
glanced
at
the
reed
house
for
instance
she
demanded
where
is
mademoiselle
she
is
alive
i
said
rather
sharply
and
even
if
what
you
say
were
true
what
in
the
world
would
make
her
wander
about
the
basements
it
seems
so
silly
nora
a
ghost
haunting
damp
cellars
and
laundries
with
stationary
tubs
and
all
well
she
contended
it
seems
silly
for
them
to
sit
on
cold
yet
that
s
where
they
generally
sit
isn
t
it
patton
listened
gravely
to
my
story
that
night
i
don
t
like
it
he
said
when
i
had
finished
of
course
the
head
on
the
staircase
is
nonsense
your
nerves
were
ragged
and
our
eyes
play
tricks
on
all
of
us
but
as
for
the
if
you
accept
her
you
must
accept
the
head
i
snapped
it
was
was
a
head
without
a
body
and
it
looked
up
at
we
were
walking
through
a
quiet
street
and
he
bent
over
and
caught
my
wrist
pulse
racing
he
commented
i
m
going
to
take
you
away
that
s
certain
i
can
t
afford
to
lose
my
best
assistant
you
re
too
close
miss
adams
you
ve
lost
your
i
ve
lost
my
temper
i
retorted
i
shall
not
leave
until
i
know
what
this
thing
is
unless
you
choose
to
ring
the
doorbell
and
tell
them
i
m
a
he
gave
in
when
he
saw
that
i
was
firm
but
not
without
a
final
protest
i
m
directly
responsible
for
you
to
your
friends
he
said
there
s
probably
a
young
man
somewhere
who
will
come
gunning
for
me
if
anything
happens
to
you
and
i
don
t
care
to
be
gunned
for
i
get
enough
of
that
in
my
regular
there
is
no
young
man
i
said
shortly
have
you
been
able
to
see
the
cellars
no
everything
is
locked
do
you
think
the
rear
staircase
goes
all
the
way
down
i
haven
t
the
slightest
you
are
in
the
house
have
you
any
suggestions
as
to
the
best
method
of
getting
into
the
house
is
reed
on
guard
all
night
i
think
he
it
may
interest
you
to
know
he
said
finally
that
i
sent
a
reliable
man
to
break
in
there
last
night
quietly
and
that
t
do
it
he
got
a
leg
through
a
cellar
window
and
came
near
not
getting
it
out
again
reed
was
just
inside
in
the
he
laughed
a
little
but
i
guessed
that
the
thing
galled
him
i
do
not
believe
that
he
would
have
found
anything
if
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
in
there
has
been
no
crime
patton
i
am
sure
of
that
but
there
is
a
menace
of
some
sort
in
the
then
why
does
reed
stay
and
keep
the
children
if
there
is
danger
i
believe
she
is
afraid
to
leave
him
there
are
times
when
i
think
that
he
is
does
he
ever
leave
the
house
i
think
not
yes
unless
he
is
the
basement
ghost
of
the
other
he
stopped
in
his
slow
walk
and
considered
it
it
s
possible
in
that
case
i
could
have
him
waylaid
tonight
in
the
gardens
and
left
there
tied
it
would
be
a
you
understand
the
police
have
no
excuse
for
coming
in
yet
or
if
we
found
him
breaking
into
one
of
the
other
houses
we
could
get
him
there
he
d
be
released
of
course
but
it
would
give
us
time
i
want
to
clean
the
thing
up
i
m
not
easy
while
you
are
in
that
we
agreed
that
i
was
to
wait
inside
one
of
my
windows
that
night
and
that
on
a
given
signal
i
should
go
down
and
open
the
front
door
the
whole
thing
of
course
was
contingent
on
reed
leaving
the
house
some
time
that
night
it
was
only
a
chance
the
house
is
barred
like
a
fortress
patton
said
as
he
left
me
the
window
with
the
grating
is
hopeless
we
tried
it
last
vi
i
find
that
my
notes
of
that
last
night
in
the
house
on
beauregard
square
are
rather
confused
some
written
at
the
time
some
just
before
for
instance
on
the
edge
of
a
newspaper
clipping
i
find
this
evidently
this
is
the
item
went
pale
on
reading
it
did
not
allow
wife
to
see
the
clipping
is
an
account
of
the
sudden
death
of
an
elderly
gentleman
named
smythe
one
of
the
beauregard
families
the
next
clipping
is
less
hasty
and
is
on
a
yellow
symptom
record
it
has
been
much
believe
i
tucked
it
in
my
apron
belt
if
the
rear
staircase
is
bolted
everywhere
from
the
inside
how
did
the
person
who
locked
it
either
or
reed
get
back
into
the
body
of
the
house
again
or
did
mademoiselle
do
it
in
that
case
she
is
no
longer
a
prisoner
and
the
bolts
outside
her
room
are
not
fastened
at
eleven
o
clock
tonight
harry
wakened
with
earache
i
went
to
the
kitchen
to
heat
some
mullein
oil
and
laudanum
reed
was
with
the
boy
and
reed
was
not
in
sight
i
slipped
into
the
library
and
used
my
skeleton
keys
on
the
locked
door
to
the
rear
room
it
was
empty
even
of
furniture
but
there
is
a
huge
box
there
with
a
lid
that
fastens
down
with
steel
hooks
the
lid
is
full
of
small
airholes
i
had
no
time
to
examine
further
it
is
one
o
clock
harry
is
asleep
and
his
mother
is
dozing
across
the
foot
of
his
bed
i
have
found
the
way
to
get
to
the
rear
staircase
there
are
outside
steps
from
the
basement
to
the
garden
the
staircase
goes
down
all
the
way
to
the
cellar
evidently
then
the
lower
door
in
the
cellar
must
be
only
locked
not
bolted
from
the
inside
i
shall
try
to
get
to
the
the
next
is
a
scrawl
can
not
get
to
the
outside
basement
steps
reed
is
wandering
round
lower
floor
i
reported
harry
s
condition
and
came
up
again
i
must
get
to
the
back
i
wonder
if
i
have
been
able
to
convey
even
faintly
the
situation
in
that
highly
respectable
old
house
that
night
the
fear
that
hung
over
it
a
fear
so
great
that
even
i
an
outsider
and
stout
of
nerve
felt
it
and
grew
cold
the
unnatural
brilliancy
of
light
that
bespoke
dread
of
the
dark
the
hushed
voices
the
locked
doors
and
staring
peering
eyes
the
babbling
frenchwoman
on
an
upper
floor
the
dead
fish
the
dead
dog
and
always
in
my
mind
that
vision
of
dread
on
the
back
staircase
and
the
thing
that
slid
over
my
foot
at
two
o
clock
i
saw
patton
or
whoever
was
on
guard
in
the
park
across
the
street
walk
quickly
toward
the
house
and
disappear
round
the
corner
toward
the
gardens
in
the
rear
there
had
been
no
signal
but
i
felt
sure
that
reed
had
left
the
house
his
wife
was
still
asleep
across
harry
s
bed
as
i
went
out
i
locked
the
door
behind
me
and
i
took
also
the
key
to
the
night
nursery
i
thought
that
something
disagreeable
to
say
the
least
was
inevitable
and
why
let
her
in
for
it
the
lower
hall
was
lighted
as
usual
and
empty
i
listened
but
there
were
no
restless
footsteps
i
did
not
like
the
lower
hall
only
a
thin
wooden
door
stood
between
me
and
the
rear
staircase
and
any
one
who
thinks
about
the
matter
will
realize
that
a
door
is
no
barrier
to
a
head
that
can
move
about
without
a
body
i
am
afraid
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
while
i
unlocked
the
front
door
and
i
know
i
breathed
better
when
i
was
out
in
the
air
i
wore
my
dark
ulster
over
my
uniform
and
i
had
my
revolver
and
keys
my
flash
of
course
was
useless
i
missed
it
horribly
but
to
get
to
the
staircase
was
an
obsession
by
that
time
in
spite
of
my
fear
of
it
to
find
what
it
guarded
to
solve
its
mystery
i
worked
round
the
house
keeping
close
to
the
wall
until
i
reached
the
garden
the
night
was
the
city
night
never
absolutely
dark
as
i
hesitated
at
the
top
of
the
basement
steps
it
seemed
to
me
that
figures
were
moving
about
among
the
trees
the
basement
door
was
unlocked
and
open
i
was
not
prepared
for
that
and
it
made
me
if
anything
more
uneasy
i
had
a
box
of
matches
with
me
and
i
wanted
light
as
a
starving
man
wants
food
but
i
dared
not
light
them
i
could
only
keep
a
tight
grip
on
my
courage
and
go
on
a
small
passage
first
with
whitewashed
stone
walls
cold
and
scaly
under
my
hand
then
a
large
room
and
still
darkness
worse
than
darkness
something
crawling
and
scratching
round
the
floor
i
struck
my
match
then
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
white
flashed
into
a
corner
and
disappeared
my
hands
were
shaking
but
i
managed
to
light
a
gas
jet
and
to
see
that
i
was
in
the
laundry
the
staircase
came
down
here
narrower
than
above
and
closed
off
with
a
door
the
door
was
closed
and
there
was
a
heavy
bolt
on
it
but
no
lock
and
now
with
the
staircase
accessible
and
a
gaslight
to
keep
up
my
courage
i
grew
brave
almost
reckless
i
would
tell
patton
all
about
this
cellar
which
his
best
men
had
not
been
able
to
enter
i
would
make
a
sketch
for
laundry
tubs
everything
foolish
of
course
but
hold
the
gas
jet
reckless
bravery
of
light
after
hideous
darkness
so
i
went
on
forward
the
glow
from
the
laundry
followed
me
i
struck
matches
found
potatoes
and
cases
of
mineral
water
bruised
my
knees
on
a
discarded
bicycle
stumbled
over
a
box
of
soap
twice
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
never
there
when
i
looked
i
caught
the
white
flash
that
had
frightened
me
before
then
at
last
i
brought
up
before
a
door
and
stopped
it
was
a
curiously
barricaded
door
nailed
against
disturbance
by
a
plank
fastened
across
and
as
if
to
make
intrusion
without
discovery
impossible
pasted
round
every
crack
and
over
the
keyhole
with
strips
of
strong
yellow
paper
it
was
an
ominous
door
i
wanted
to
run
away
from
it
and
i
wanted
also
desperately
to
stand
and
look
at
it
and
imagine
what
might
lie
beyond
here
again
was
the
strange
spicy
odor
that
i
had
noticed
in
the
back
staircase
i
think
it
is
indicative
of
my
state
of
mind
that
i
backed
away
from
the
door
i
did
not
turn
and
run
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
made
me
turn
my
back
to
it
somehow
or
other
i
got
back
into
the
laundry
and
jerked
myself
together
it
was
ten
minutes
after
two
i
had
been
just
ten
minutes
in
the
basement
the
staircase
daunted
me
in
my
shaken
condition
i
made
excuses
for
delaying
my
venture
looked
for
another
box
of
matches
listened
at
the
end
of
the
passage
finally
slid
the
bolts
and
opened
the
door
the
silence
was
impressive
in
the
laundry
there
were
small
familiar
dripping
of
water
from
a
faucet
the
muffled
measure
of
a
gas
meter
the
ticking
of
a
clock
on
the
shelf
to
leave
it
all
to
climb
into
that
lying
on
the
lower
step
was
a
curious
instrument
it
was
a
sort
of
tongs
made
of
steel
about
two
feet
long
and
fastened
together
like
a
pair
of
scissors
the
joint
about
five
inches
from
the
flattened
ends
i
carried
it
to
the
light
and
examined
it
one
end
was
smeared
with
blood
and
short
brownish
hairs
it
made
me
shudder
that
time
on
i
think
i
knew
not
the
whole
story
of
course
but
somewhere
in
the
back
of
my
head
as
i
climbed
in
that
hideous
quiet
the
explanation
was
developing
itself
i
did
not
think
it
out
it
worked
itself
out
as
step
after
step
match
after
match
i
climbed
the
staircase
up
to
the
first
floor
there
was
nothing
the
landing
was
bare
of
carpet
i
was
on
the
first
floor
now
on
each
side
doors
carefully
bolted
led
into
the
house
i
opened
the
one
into
the
hall
and
listened
i
had
been
gone
from
the
children
fifteen
minutes
and
they
were
on
my
mind
but
everything
was
quiet
the
sight
of
the
lights
and
the
familiar
hall
gave
me
courage
after
all
if
i
was
right
what
could
the
head
on
the
staircase
have
been
but
an
optical
delusion
and
i
was
right
the
in
my
hand
i
closed
and
bolted
the
door
and
felt
my
way
back
to
the
stairs
i
lighted
no
matches
this
time
i
had
only
a
few
and
on
this
landing
there
was
a
little
light
from
the
grated
window
although
the
staircase
above
was
in
black
shadow
i
had
one
foot
on
the
lowest
stair
when
suddenly
overhead
came
the
thudding
of
hands
on
a
closed
door
it
broke
the
silence
like
an
explosion
it
sent
chills
up
and
down
my
spine
i
could
not
move
for
a
moment
it
was
the
frenchwoman
i
believe
i
thought
of
fire
the
idea
had
obsessed
me
in
that
house
of
locked
doors
i
remember
a
strangling
weight
of
fright
on
my
chest
and
of
trying
to
breathe
then
i
started
up
the
staircase
running
as
fast
as
i
could
lift
my
weighted
feet
i
remember
that
and
getting
up
perhaps
a
third
of
the
way
then
there
came
a
plunging
forward
into
space
my
hands
out
a
shriek
frozen
on
my
lips
i
do
not
think
i
fainted
i
know
i
was
always
conscious
of
my
arm
doubled
under
me
a
pain
and
darkness
i
could
hear
myself
moaning
but
almost
as
if
it
were
some
one
else
there
were
other
sounds
but
they
did
not
concern
me
much
i
was
not
even
curious
about
my
location
i
seemed
to
be
a
very
small
consciousness
surrounded
by
a
great
deal
of
pain
several
centuries
later
a
light
came
and
leaned
over
me
from
somewhere
above
then
the
light
said
here
she
is
alive
i
knew
that
voice
but
i
could
not
think
whose
it
was
i
m
yes
she
s
they
got
me
out
somewhere
and
i
believe
i
still
clung
to
the
tongs
i
had
fallen
on
them
and
had
a
cut
on
my
chin
i
could
stand
i
found
although
i
swayed
there
was
plenty
of
light
now
in
the
back
hallway
and
a
man
i
had
never
seen
was
investigating
the
staircase
four
steps
off
he
said
risers
and
treads
gone
and
the
supports
sawed
away
it
s
a
trap
of
some
patton
was
examining
my
broken
arm
and
paid
no
attention
the
man
let
himself
down
into
the
pit
under
the
staircase
when
he
straightened
only
his
head
rose
above
the
steps
although
i
was
white
with
pain
to
the
very
lips
i
laughed
hysterically
the
head
i
cried
patton
swore
under
his
breath
they
half
led
half
carried
me
into
the
library
reed
was
there
with
a
detective
on
guard
over
him
he
was
sitting
in
his
old
position
bent
forward
chin
in
palms
in
the
blaze
of
light
he
was
a
pitiable
figure
smeared
with
dust
disheveled
from
what
had
evidently
been
a
struggle
patton
put
me
in
a
chair
and
dispatched
one
of
the
two
men
for
the
nearest
doctor
this
young
lady
he
said
curtly
to
reed
fell
into
that
damnable
trap
you
made
in
the
rear
i
locked
off
the
i
am
sorry
she
is
hurt
wife
will
be
shocked
only
i
wish
you
d
tell
me
what
all
this
is
about
you
can
t
arrest
me
for
going
into
a
friend
s
if
i
send
for
some
member
of
the
smythe
family
will
they
acquit
you
certainly
they
will
he
said
ve
been
raised
with
the
smythes
you
can
send
for
any
one
you
but
his
tone
lacked
conviction
patton
made
me
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
then
sending
the
remaining
detective
out
into
the
hall
he
turned
to
his
prisoner
now
reed
he
said
i
want
you
to
be
sensible
for
some
days
a
figure
has
been
seen
in
the
basements
of
the
various
beauregard
houses
your
friends
the
smythes
reported
it
tonight
we
are
on
watch
and
we
see
you
breaking
into
the
basement
of
the
smythe
house
we
already
know
some
curious
things
about
you
such
as
dismissing
all
the
servants
on
half
an
hour
s
notice
and
the
disappearance
of
the
french
mademoiselle
why
he
checked
himself
when
we
bring
you
here
tonight
and
you
ask
to
be
allowed
to
go
upstairs
and
prepare
your
wife
she
is
locked
in
the
nurse
is
missing
we
find
her
at
last
also
locked
away
and
badly
hurt
lying
in
a
staircase
trap
where
some
one
probably
yourself
has
removed
the
steps
i
do
not
want
to
arrest
you
but
now
i
ve
started
i
m
going
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
all
reed
was
ghastly
but
he
straightened
in
his
chair
the
smythes
reported
this
thing
did
they
he
asked
well
tell
me
one
thing
what
killed
the
old
smythe
i
don
t
well
go
a
little
his
cunning
was
boyish
pitiful
how
did
he
die
or
don
t
you
know
that
either
up
to
this
point
i
had
been
rather
a
detached
part
of
the
scene
but
now
my
eyes
fell
on
the
tongs
beside
me
mr
reed
i
said
isn
t
this
thing
too
big
for
you
to
handle
by
yourself
what
thing
you
know
what
i
mean
you
ve
protected
yourself
well
enough
but
even
if
thing
you
know
of
did
not
kill
old
smythe
you
can
not
tell
what
will
happen
i
ve
got
almost
all
of
them
he
muttered
sullenly
another
night
or
two
and
i
d
have
had
the
but
even
then
the
mischief
may
go
on
it
means
a
crusade
it
means
rousing
the
city
isn
t
it
the
square
thing
now
to
spread
the
alarm
patton
could
stand
the
suspense
no
longer
perhaps
miss
adams
he
said
you
will
be
good
enough
to
let
me
know
what
you
are
talking
reed
looked
up
at
him
with
heavy
eyes
rats
he
said
they
got
away
twenty
of
them
loaded
with
bubonic
i
went
to
the
hospital
the
next
morning
patton
thought
it
best
there
was
no
one
in
my
little
flat
to
look
after
me
and
although
the
pain
in
my
arm
subsided
after
the
fracture
was
set
i
was
still
shaken
he
came
the
next
afternoon
to
see
me
i
was
propped
up
in
bed
with
my
hair
braided
down
in
two
pigtails
and
great
hollows
under
my
eyes
i
m
comfortable
enough
i
said
in
response
to
his
inquiry
but
i
m
feeling
all
of
my
years
this
is
my
birthday
i
am
thirty
i
wonder
he
said
reflectively
if
i
ever
reach
the
mature
age
of
one
hundred
if
i
will
carry
in
my
head
as
many
odds
and
ends
of
information
as
you
have
at
thirty
i
you
how
in
the
world
did
you
know
for
instance
about
those
tongs
it
was
quite
simple
i
d
seen
something
like
them
in
the
laboratory
here
of
course
i
didn
t
know
what
animals
he
d
used
but
the
grayish
brown
hair
looked
like
rats
the
laboratory
must
be
the
cellar
room
i
knew
it
had
been
was
sealed
with
paper
even
over
the
so
sitting
there
beside
me
patton
told
me
the
story
as
he
had
got
it
from
tale
of
the
offer
in
an
english
scientific
journal
of
a
large
reward
from
some
country
of
the
east
for
an
serum
reed
had
been
working
along
bacteriological
lines
in
his
basement
laboratory
mostly
with
guinea
pigs
and
tuberculosis
he
was
in
debt
the
offer
loomed
large
he
seems
to
think
he
was
on
the
right
track
patton
said
he
had
twenty
of
the
creatures
in
deep
zinc
cans
with
perforated
lids
he
says
the
disease
is
spread
by
fleas
that
infest
the
rats
so
he
had
muslin
as
well
over
the
lids
one
can
had
infected
rats
six
of
them
then
one
day
the
frenchwoman
tried
to
give
the
dog
a
bath
in
a
laundry
tub
and
the
dog
bolted
the
laboratory
door
was
open
in
some
way
and
he
ran
between
the
cans
upsetting
them
every
rat
was
out
in
an
instant
the
frenchwoman
was
frantic
she
shut
the
door
and
tried
to
drive
the
things
back
one
bit
her
on
the
foot
the
dog
was
not
bitten
but
there
was
the
question
of
fleas
well
the
rats
got
away
and
mademoiselle
retired
to
her
room
to
die
of
plague
she
was
a
loyal
old
soul
she
wouldn
t
let
them
call
a
doctor
it
would
mean
exposure
and
after
all
what
could
the
doctors
do
reed
used
his
serum
and
she
s
alive
reed
was
frantic
his
wife
would
not
leave
there
was
the
frenchwoman
to
look
after
and
i
think
she
was
afraid
he
would
do
something
desperate
they
did
the
best
they
could
under
the
circumstances
for
the
children
they
burned
most
of
the
carpets
for
fear
of
fleas
and
put
poison
everywhere
of
course
he
had
traps
too
he
had
brass
tags
on
the
necks
of
the
rats
and
he
got
back
a
uninfected
ones
the
other
ones
were
probably
dead
but
he
couldn
t
stop
at
that
he
had
to
be
sure
that
the
trouble
had
not
spread
and
to
add
to
their
horror
the
sewer
along
the
street
was
being
relaid
and
they
had
an
influx
of
rats
into
the
house
they
found
them
everywhere
in
the
lower
floor
they
even
climbed
the
stairs
he
says
that
the
night
you
came
he
caught
a
big
fellow
on
the
front
staircase
there
was
always
the
danger
that
the
fleas
that
carry
the
trouble
had
deserted
the
dead
creatures
for
new
fields
they
took
up
all
the
rest
of
the
carpets
and
burned
them
to
add
to
the
general
misery
the
dog
chang
developed
unmistakable
symptoms
and
had
to
be
but
the
broken
staircase
i
asked
and
what
was
it
that
mademoiselle
said
was
coming
up
the
steps
were
up
for
two
reasons
the
rats
could
not
climb
up
and
beneath
the
steps
reed
says
he
caught
in
a
trap
two
of
the
tagged
ones
as
for
mademoiselle
the
thing
that
was
coming
up
was
her
fright
the
head
you
saw
was
poor
reed
himself
wrapped
in
gauze
against
trouble
and
baiting
his
traps
he
caught
a
lot
in
the
neighbors
cellars
and
some
in
the
but
why
i
demanded
why
didn
t
he
make
it
all
known
patton
laughed
while
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
man
hardly
cares
to
announce
that
he
has
menaced
the
health
of
a
but
that
night
when
i
it
only
last
night
one
was
pounding
above
i
thought
there
was
a
the
frenchwoman
had
seen
us
waylay
reed
from
her
window
she
was
and
the
trouble
is
over
now
not
at
all
he
replied
cheerfully
the
trouble
may
be
only
beginning
we
re
keeping
reed
s
name
out
but
the
board
of
health
has
issued
a
general
warning
personally
i
think
his
six
pets
died
without
passing
anything
but
there
was
a
big
box
with
a
ferrets
he
assured
me
nice
white
ferrets
with
pink
eyes
and
a
taste
for
he
held
out
a
thumb
carefully
bandaged
reed
had
a
couple
under
his
coat
when
we
took
him
in
the
garden
probably
one
ran
over
your
foot
that
night
when
you
surprised
him
on
the
back
i
went
pale
but
if
they
are
infected
i
cried
and
you
are
the
first
thing
a
nurse
should
learn
he
bent
forward
smiling
is
not
to
alarm
her
but
you
don
t
understand
the
danger
i
said
despairingly
oh
if
only
men
had
a
little
bit
of
sense
i
must
do
something
desperate
then
have
the
thumb
cut
off
perhaps
i
did
not
answer
i
lay
back
on
my
pillows
with
my
eyes
shut
i
had
given
him
the
plague
had
seen
him
die
and
be
buried
before
he
spoke
again
the
chin
he
said
is
not
so
firm
as
i
had
thought
the
outlines
are
savage
but
the
you
poor
little
thing
are
you
really
frightened
i
don
t
like
you
i
said
furiously
but
i
d
hate
to
see
any
one
that
then
i
ll
confess
i
was
trying
to
take
your
mind
off
your
troubles
the
bite
is
there
but
harmless
those
were
new
ferrets
had
never
been
i
did
not
speak
to
him
again
i
was
seething
with
indignation
he
stood
for
a
time
looking
down
at
me
then
unexpectedly
he
bent
over
and
touched
his
lips
to
my
bandaged
arm
poor
arm
he
said
poor
brave
little
arm
then
he
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
his
very
back
was
sheepish
transcriber
s
note
silently
corrected
obvious
typographical
errors
left
spellings
and
dialect
unchanged
