chapter
i
the

the
signora
had
no
business
to
do
it
said
miss
bartlett
no
business
at
all
she
promised
us
south
rooms
with
a
view
close
together
instead
of
which
here
are
north
rooms
looking
into
a
courtyard
and
a
long
way
apart
oh
lucy
and
a
cockney
besides
said
lucy
who
had
been
further
saddened
by
the
signora
s
unexpected
accent
it
might
be
she
looked
at
the
two
rows
of
english
people
who
were
sitting
at
the
table
at
the
row
of
white
bottles
of
water
and
red
bottles
of
wine
that
ran
between
the
english
people
at
the
portraits
of
the
late
queen
and
the
late
poet
laureate
that
hung
behind
the
english
people
heavily
framed
at
the
notice
of
the
english
church

cuthbert
eager

that
was

charlotte
don
t
you
feel
too
that
we
might
be
in
london
i
can
hardly
believe
that
all
kinds
of
other
things
are
just
outside
i
suppose
it
is
one
s
being
so
this
meat
has
surely
been
used
for
soup
said
miss
bartlett
laying
down
her
fork
i
want
so
to
see
the
arno
the
rooms
the
signora
promised
us
in
her
letter
would
have
looked
over
the
arno
the
signora
had
no
business
to
do
it
at
all
oh
it
is
a
shame
any
nook
does
for
me
miss
bartlett
continued
but
it
does
seem
hard
that
you
shouldn
t
have
a
lucy
felt
that
she
had
been
selfish
charlotte
you
mustn
t
spoil
me
of
course
you
must
look
over
the
arno
too
i
meant
that
the
first
vacant
room
in
the
front
you
must
have
it
said
miss
bartlett
part
of
whose
travelling
expenses
were
paid
by
lucy
s
mother
a
piece
of
generosity
to
which
she
made
many
a
tactful
allusion
no
no
you
must
have
i
insist
on
it
your
mother
would
never
forgive
me
she
would
never
forgive
the
ladies
voices
grew
animated
and
if
the
sad
truth
be
owned
a
little
peevish
they
were
tired
and
under
the
guise
of
unselfishness
they
wrangled
some
of
their
neighbours
interchanged
glances
and
one
of
them
one
of
the
people
whom
one
does
meet
abroad
leant
forward
over
the
table
and
actually
intruded
into
their
argument
he
said
i
have
a
view
i
have
a
miss
bartlett
was
startled
generally
at
a
pension
people
looked
them
over
for
a
day
or
two
before
speaking
and
often
did
not
find
out
that
they
would
do
till
they
had
gone
she
knew
that
the
intruder
was
even
before
she
glanced
at
him
he
was
an
old
man
of
heavy
build
with
a
fair
shaven
face
and
large
eyes
there
was
something
childish
in
those
eyes
though
it
was
not
the
childishness
of
senility
what
exactly
it
was
miss
bartlett
did
not
stop
to
consider
for
her
glance
passed
on
to
his
clothes
these
did
not
attract
her
he
was
probably
trying
to
become
acquainted
with
them
before
they
got
into
the
swim
so
she
assumed
a
dazed
expression
when
he
spoke
to
her
and
then
said
a
view
oh
a
view
how
delightful
a
view
is
this
is
my
son
said
the
old
man
his
name
s
george
he
has
a
view
ah
said
miss
bartlett
repressing
lucy
who
was
about
to
speak
what
i
mean
he
continued
is
that
you
can
have
our
rooms
and
we
ll
have
yours
we
ll
the
better
class
of
tourist
was
shocked
at
this
and
sympathized
with
the
miss
bartlett
in
reply
opened
her
mouth
as
little
as
possible
and
said
thank
you
very
much
indeed
that
is
out
of
the
why
said
the
old
man
with
both
fists
on
the
table
because
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
thank
you
see
we
don
t
like
to
take
began
lucy
her
cousin
again
repressed
her
but
why
he
persisted
women
like
looking
at
a
view
men
don
and
he
thumped
with
his
fists
like
a
naughty
child
and
turned
to
his
son
saying
george
persuade
them
it
s
so
obvious
they
should
have
the
rooms
said
the
son
there
s
nothing
else
to
he
did
not
look
at
the
ladies
as
he
spoke
but
his
voice
was
perplexed
and
sorrowful
lucy
too
was
perplexed
but
she
saw
that
they
were
in
for
what
is
known
as
quite
a
scene
and
she
had
an
odd
feeling
that
whenever
these
tourists
spoke
the
contest
widened
and
deepened
till
it
dealt
not
with
rooms
and
views
but
with
well
with
something
quite
different
whose
existence
she
had
not
realized
before
now
the
old
man
attacked
miss
bartlett
almost
violently
why
should
she
not
change
what
possible
objection
had
she
they
would
clear
out
in
half
an
hour
miss
bartlett
though
skilled
in
the
delicacies
of
conversation
was
powerless
in
the
presence
of
brutality
it
was
impossible
to
snub
any
one
so
gross
her
face
reddened
with
displeasure
she
looked
around
as
much
as
to
say
are
you
all
like
this
and
two
little
old
ladies
who
were
sitting
further
up
the
table
with
shawls
hanging
over
the
backs
of
the
chairs
looked
back
clearly
indicating
we
are
not
we
are
eat
your
dinner
dear
she
said
to
lucy
and
began
to
toy
again
with
the
meat
that
she
had
once
censured
lucy
mumbled
that
those
seemed
very
odd
people
opposite
eat
your
dinner
dear
this
pension
is
a
failure
we
will
make
a
hardly
had
she
announced
this
fell
decision
when
she
reversed
it
the
curtains
at
the
end
of
the
room
parted
and
revealed
a
clergyman
stout
but
attractive
who
hurried
forward
to
take
his
place
at
the
table
cheerfully
apologizing
for
his
lateness
lucy
who
had
not
yet
acquired
decency
at
once
rose
to
her
feet
exclaiming
oh
oh
why
it
s
beebe
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
oh
charlotte
we
must
stop
now
however
bad
the
rooms
are
oh
miss
bartlett
said
with
more
restraint
how
do
you
do
beebe
i
expect
that
you
have
forgotten
us
miss
bartlett
and
miss
honeychurch
who
were
at
tunbridge
wells
when
you
helped
the
vicar
of
peter
s
that
very
cold
the
clergyman
who
had
the
air
of
one
on
a
holiday
did
not
remember
the
ladies
quite
as
clearly
as
they
remembered
him
but
he
came
forward
pleasantly
enough
and
accepted
the
chair
into
which
he
was
beckoned
by
lucy
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
said
the
girl
who
was
in
a
state
of
spiritual
starvation
and
would
have
been
glad
to
see
the
waiter
if
her
cousin
had
permitted
it
just
fancy
how
small
the
world
is
summer
street
too
makes
it
so
specially
miss
honeychurch
lives
in
the
parish
of
summer
street
said
miss
bartlett
filling
up
the
gap
and
she
happened
to
tell
me
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
you
have
just
accepted
the
living
yes
i
heard
from
mother
so
last
week
she
didn
t
know
that
i
knew
you
at
tunbridge
wells
but
i
wrote
back
at
once
and
i
said
mr
beebe
is
quite
right
said
the
clergyman
i
move
into
the
rectory
at
summer
street
next
june
i
am
lucky
to
be
appointed
to
such
a
charming
oh
how
glad
i
am
the
name
of
our
house
is
windy
beebe
bowed
there
is
mother
and
me
generally
and
my
brother
though
it
s
not
often
we
get
him
to
ch
the
church
is
rather
far
off
i
lucy
dearest
let
beebe
eat
his
i
am
eating
it
thank
you
and
enjoying
he
preferred
to
talk
to
lucy
whose
playing
he
remembered
rather
than
to
miss
bartlett
who
probably
remembered
his
sermons
he
asked
the
girl
whether
she
knew
florence
well
and
was
informed
at
some
length
that
she
had
never
been
there
before
it
is
delightful
to
advise
a
newcomer
and
he
was
first
in
the
field
don
t
neglect
the
country
round
his
advice
concluded
the
first
fine
afternoon
drive
up
to
fiesole
and
round
by
settignano
or
something
of
that
no
cried
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
table
mr
beebe
you
are
wrong
the
first
fine
afternoon
your
ladies
must
go
to
that
lady
looks
so
clever
whispered
miss
bartlett
to
her
cousin
we
are
in
and
indeed
a
perfect
torrent
of
information
burst
on
them
people
told
them
what
to
see
when
to
see
it
how
to
stop
the
electric
trams
how
to
get
rid
of
the
beggars
how
much
to
give
for
a
vellum
blotter
how
much
the
place
would
grow
upon
them
the
pension
bertolini
had
decided
almost
enthusiastically
that
they
would
do
whichever
way
they
looked
kind
ladies
smiled
and
shouted
at
them
and
above
all
rose
the
voice
of
the
clever
lady
crying
prato
they
must
go
to
prato
that
place
is
too
sweetly
squalid
for
words
i
love
it
i
revel
in
shaking
off
the
trammels
of
respectability
as
you
the
young
man
named
george
glanced
at
the
clever
lady
and
then
returned
moodily
to
his
plate
obviously
he
and
his
father
did
not
do
lucy
in
the
midst
of
her
success
found
time
to
wish
they
did
it
gave
her
no
extra
pleasure
that
any
one
should
be
left
in
the
cold
and
when
she
rose
to
go
she
turned
back
and
gave
the
two
outsiders
a
nervous
little
bow
the
father
did
not
see
it
the
son
acknowledged
it
not
by
another
bow
but
by
raising
his
eyebrows
and
smiling
he
seemed
to
be
smiling
across
something
she
hastened
after
her
cousin
who
had
already
disappeared
through
the
curtains
curtains
which
smote
one
in
the
face
and
seemed
heavy
with
more
than
cloth
beyond
them
stood
the
unreliable
signora
bowing
to
her
guests
and
supported
by
enery
her
little
boy
and
victorier
her
daughter
it
made
a
curious
little
scene
this
attempt
of
the
cockney
to
convey
the
grace
and
geniality
of
the
south
and
even
more
curious
was
the
which
attempted
to
rival
the
solid
comfort
of
a
bloomsbury
was
this
really
italy
miss
bartlett
was
already
seated
on
a
tightly
stuffed
which
had
the
colour
and
the
contours
of
a
tomato
she
was
talking
to
beebe
and
as
she
spoke
her
long
narrow
head
drove
backwards
and
forwards
slowly
regularly
as
though
she
were
demolishing
some
invisible
obstacle
we
are
most
grateful
to
you
she
was
saying
the
first
evening
means
so
much
when
you
arrived
we
were
in
for
a
peculiarly
mauvais
quart
d
he
expressed
his
regret
do
you
by
any
chance
know
the
name
of
an
old
man
who
sat
opposite
us
at
dinner
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
we
are
friendly
as
one
is
in
then
i
will
say
no
he
pressed
her
very
slightly
and
she
said
more
i
am
as
it
were
she
concluded
the
chaperon
of
my
young
cousin
lucy
and
it
would
be
a
serious
thing
if
i
put
her
under
an
obligation
to
people
of
whom
we
know
nothing
his
manner
was
somewhat
unfortunate
i
hope
i
acted
for
the
you
acted
very
naturally
said
he
he
seemed
thoughtful
and
after
a
few
moments
added
all
the
same
i
don
t
think
much
harm
would
have
come
of
no
harm
of
course
but
we
could
not
be
under
an
he
is
rather
a
peculiar
again
he
hesitated
and
then
said
gently
i
think
he
would
not
take
advantage
of
your
acceptance
nor
expect
you
to
show
gratitude
he
has
the
merit
if
it
is
one
of
saying
exactly
what
he
means
he
has
rooms
he
does
not
value
and
he
thinks
you
would
value
them
he
no
more
thought
of
putting
you
under
an
obligation
than
he
thought
of
being
polite
it
is
so
difficult
at
least
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
people
who
speak
the
lucy
was
pleased
and
said
i
was
hoping
that
he
was
nice
i
do
so
always
hope
that
people
will
be
i
think
he
is
nice
and
tiresome
i
differ
from
him
on
almost
every
point
of
any
importance
and
so
i
expect
i
may
say
i
hope
you
will
differ
but
his
is
a
type
one
disagrees
with
rather
than
deplores
when
he
first
came
here
he
not
unnaturally
put
people
s
backs
up
he
has
no
tact
and
no
manners
i
don
t
mean
by
that
that
he
has
bad
manners
and
he
will
not
keep
his
opinions
to
himself
we
nearly
complained
about
him
to
our
depressing
signora
but
i
am
glad
to
say
we
thought
better
of
am
i
to
conclude
said
miss
bartlett
that
he
is
a
socialist
beebe
accepted
the
convenient
word
not
without
a
slight
twitching
of
the
lips
and
presumably
he
has
brought
up
his
son
to
be
a
socialist
too
i
hardly
know
george
for
he
hasn
t
learnt
to
talk
yet
he
seems
a
nice
creature
and
i
think
he
has
brains
of
course
he
has
all
his
father
s
mannerisms
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
too
may
be
a
oh
you
relieve
me
said
miss
bartlett
so
you
think
i
ought
to
have
accepted
their
offer
you
feel
i
have
been
and
suspicious
not
at
all
he
answered
i
never
suggested
but
ought
i
not
to
apologize
at
all
events
for
my
apparent
rudeness
he
replied
with
some
irritation
that
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
and
got
up
from
his
seat
to
go
to
the
was
i
a
bore
said
miss
bartlett
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
why
didn
t
you
talk
lucy
he
prefers
young
people
i
m
sure
i
do
hope
i
haven
t
monopolized
him
i
hoped
you
would
have
him
all
the
evening
as
well
as
all
he
is
nice
exclaimed
lucy
just
what
i
remember
he
seems
to
see
good
in
everyone
no
one
would
take
him
for
a
my
dear
lucia
well
you
know
what
i
mean
and
you
know
how
clergymen
generally
laugh
beebe
laughs
just
like
an
ordinary
funny
girl
how
you
do
remind
me
of
your
mother
i
wonder
if
she
will
approve
of
i
m
sure
she
will
and
so
will
i
think
everyone
at
windy
corner
will
approve
it
is
the
fashionable
world
i
am
used
to
tunbridge
wells
where
we
are
all
hopelessly
behind
the
yes
said
lucy
despondently
there
was
a
haze
of
disapproval
in
the
air
but
whether
the
disapproval
was
of
herself
or
of
beebe
or
of
the
fashionable
world
at
windy
corner
or
of
the
narrow
world
at
tunbridge
wells
she
could
not
determine
she
tried
to
locate
it
but
as
usual
she
blundered
miss
bartlett
sedulously
denied
disapproving
of
any
one
and
added
i
am
afraid
you
are
finding
me
a
very
depressing
and
the
girl
again
thought
i
must
have
been
selfish
or
unkind
i
must
be
more
careful
it
is
so
dreadful
for
charlotte
being
fortunately
one
of
the
little
old
ladies
who
for
some
time
had
been
smiling
very
benignly
now
approached
and
asked
if
she
might
be
allowed
to
sit
where
beebe
had
sat
permission
granted
she
began
to
chatter
gently
about
italy
the
plunge
it
had
been
to
come
there
the
gratifying
success
of
the
plunge
the
improvement
in
her
sister
s
health
the
necessity
of
closing
the
windows
at
night
and
of
thoroughly
emptying
the
in
the
morning
she
handled
her
subjects
agreeably
and
they
were
perhaps
more
worthy
of
attention
than
the
high
discourse
upon
guelfs
and
ghibellines
which
was
proceeding
tempestuously
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
it
was
a
real
catastrophe
not
a
mere
episode
that
evening
of
hers
at
venice
when
she
had
found
in
her
bedroom
something
that
is
one
worse
than
a
flea
though
one
better
than
something
else
but
here
you
are
as
safe
as
in
england
signora
bertolini
is
so
yet
our
rooms
smell
said
poor
lucy
we
dread
going
to
ah
then
you
look
into
the
she
sighed
if
only
emerson
was
more
tactful
we
were
so
sorry
for
you
at
i
think
he
was
meaning
to
be
undoubtedly
he
was
said
miss
bartlett
mr
beebe
has
just
been
scolding
me
for
my
suspicious
nature
of
course
i
was
holding
back
on
my
cousin
s
of
course
said
the
little
old
lady
and
they
murmured
that
one
could
not
be
too
careful
with
a
young
girl
lucy
tried
to
look
demure
but
could
not
help
feeling
a
great
fool
no
one
was
careful
with
her
at
home
or
at
all
events
she
had
not
noticed
it
about
old
emerson
i
hardly
know
no
he
is
not
tactful
yet
have
you
ever
noticed
that
there
are
people
who
do
things
which
are
most
indelicate
and
yet
at
the
same
time
beautiful
beautiful
said
miss
bartlett
puzzled
at
the
word
are
not
beauty
and
delicacy
the
same
so
one
would
have
thought
said
the
other
helplessly
but
things
are
so
difficult
i
sometimes
she
proceeded
no
further
into
things
for
beebe
reappeared
looking
extremely
pleasant
miss
bartlett
he
cried
it
s
all
right
about
the
rooms
i
m
so
glad
emerson
was
talking
about
it
in
the
and
knowing
what
i
did
i
encouraged
him
to
make
the
offer
again
he
has
let
me
come
and
ask
you
he
would
be
so
oh
charlotte
cried
lucy
to
her
cousin
we
must
have
the
rooms
now
the
old
man
is
just
as
nice
and
kind
as
he
can
miss
bartlett
was
silent
i
fear
said
beebe
after
a
pause
that
i
have
been
officious
i
must
apologize
for
my
gravely
displeased
he
turned
to
go
not
till
then
did
miss
bartlett
reply
my
own
wishes
dearest
lucy
are
unimportant
in
comparison
with
yours
it
would
be
hard
indeed
if
i
stopped
you
doing
as
you
liked
at
florence
when
i
am
only
here
through
your
kindness
if
you
wish
me
to
turn
these
gentlemen
out
of
their
rooms
i
will
do
it
would
you
then
beebe
kindly
tell
emerson
that
i
accept
his
kind
offer
and
then
conduct
him
to
me
in
order
that
i
may
thank
him
personally
she
raised
her
voice
as
she
spoke
it
was
heard
all
over
the
and
silenced
the
guelfs
and
the
ghibellines
the
clergyman
inwardly
cursing
the
female
sex
bowed
and
departed
with
her
message
remember
lucy
i
alone
am
implicated
in
this
i
do
not
wish
the
acceptance
to
come
from
you
grant
me
that
at
all
beebe
was
back
saying
rather
nervously
mr
emerson
is
engaged
but
here
is
his
son
the
young
man
gazed
down
on
the
three
ladies
who
felt
seated
on
the
floor
so
low
were
their
chairs
my
father
he
said
is
in
his
bath
so
you
can
not
thank
him
personally
but
any
message
given
by
you
to
me
will
be
given
by
me
to
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
miss
bartlett
was
unequal
to
the
bath
all
her
barbed
civilities
came
forth
wrong
end
first
young
emerson
scored
a
notable
triumph
to
the
delight
of
beebe
and
to
the
secret
delight
of
lucy
poor
young
man
said
miss
bartlett
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
how
angry
he
is
with
his
father
about
the
rooms
it
is
all
he
can
do
to
keep
in
half
an
hour
or
so
your
rooms
will
be
ready
said
beebe
then
looking
rather
thoughtfully
at
the
two
cousins
he
retired
to
his
own
rooms
to
write
up
his
philosophic
diary
oh
dear
breathed
the
little
old
lady
and
shuddered
as
if
all
the
winds
of
heaven
had
entered
the
apartment
gentlemen
sometimes
do
not
realize
her
voice
faded
away
but
miss
bartlett
seemed
to
understand
and
a
conversation
developed
in
which
gentlemen
who
did
not
thoroughly
realize
played
a
principal
part
lucy
not
realizing
either
was
reduced
to
literature
taking
up
baedeker
s
handbook
to
northern
italy
she
committed
to
memory
the
most
important
dates
of
florentine
history
for
she
was
determined
to
enjoy
herself
on
the
morrow
thus
the
crept
profitably
away
and
at
last
miss
bartlett
rose
with
a
sigh
and
said
i
think
one
might
venture
now
no
lucy
do
not
stir
i
will
superintend
the
how
you
do
do
everything
said
lucy
naturally
dear
it
is
my
but
i
would
like
to
help
no
charlotte
s
energy
and
her
unselfishness
she
had
been
thus
all
her
life
but
really
on
this
italian
tour
she
was
surpassing
herself
so
lucy
felt
or
strove
to
feel
and
yet
there
was
a
rebellious
spirit
in
her
which
wondered
whether
the
acceptance
might
not
have
been
less
delicate
and
more
beautiful
at
all
events
she
entered
her
own
room
without
any
feeling
of
joy
i
want
to
explain
said
miss
bartlett
why
it
is
that
i
have
taken
the
largest
room
naturally
of
course
i
should
have
given
it
to
you
but
i
happen
to
know
that
it
belongs
to
the
young
man
and
i
was
sure
your
mother
would
not
like
lucy
was
bewildered
if
you
are
to
accept
a
favour
it
is
more
suitable
you
should
be
under
an
obligation
to
his
father
than
to
him
i
am
a
woman
of
the
world
in
my
small
way
and
i
know
where
things
lead
to
however
beebe
is
a
guarantee
of
a
sort
that
they
will
not
presume
on
mother
wouldn
t
mind
i
m
sure
said
lucy
but
again
had
the
sense
of
larger
and
unsuspected
issues
miss
bartlett
only
sighed
and
enveloped
her
in
a
protecting
embrace
as
she
wished
her
it
gave
lucy
the
sensation
of
a
fog
and
when
she
reached
her
own
room
she
opened
the
window
and
breathed
the
clean
night
air
thinking
of
the
kind
old
man
who
had
enabled
her
to
see
the
lights
dancing
in
the
arno
and
the
cypresses
of
san
miniato
and
the
of
the
apennines
black
against
the
rising
moon
miss
bartlett
in
her
room
fastened
the
and
locked
the
door
and
then
made
a
tour
of
the
apartment
to
see
where
the
cupboards
led
and
whether
there
were
any
oubliettes
or
secret
entrances
it
was
then
that
she
saw
pinned
up
over
the
washstand
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
was
scrawled
an
enormous
note
of
interrogation
nothing
more
what
does
it
mean
she
thought
and
she
examined
it
carefully
by
the
light
of
a
candle
meaningless
at
first
it
gradually
became
menacing
obnoxious
portentous
with
evil
she
was
seized
with
an
impulse
to
destroy
it
but
fortunately
remembered
that
she
had
no
right
to
do
so
since
it
must
be
the
property
of
young
emerson
so
she
unpinned
it
carefully
and
put
it
between
two
pieces
of
to
keep
it
clean
for
him
then
she
completed
her
inspection
of
the
room
sighed
heavily
according
to
her
habit
and
went
to
bed
chapter
ii
in
santa
croce
with
no
baedeker
it
was
pleasant
to
wake
up
in
florence
to
open
the
eyes
upon
a
bright
bare
room
with
a
floor
of
red
tiles
which
look
clean
though
they
are
not
with
a
painted
ceiling
whereon
pink
griffins
and
blue
amorini
sport
in
a
forest
of
yellow
violins
and
bassoons
it
was
pleasant
too
to
fling
wide
the
windows
pinching
the
fingers
in
unfamiliar
fastenings
to
lean
out
into
sunshine
with
beautiful
hills
and
trees
and
marble
churches
opposite
and
close
below
the
arno
gurgling
against
the
embankment
of
the
road
over
the
river
men
were
at
work
with
spades
and
sieves
on
the
sandy
foreshore
and
on
the
river
was
a
boat
also
diligently
employed
for
some
mysterious
end
an
electric
tram
came
rushing
underneath
the
window
no
one
was
inside
it
except
one
tourist
but
its
platforms
were
overflowing
with
italians
who
preferred
to
stand
children
tried
to
hang
on
behind
and
the
conductor
with
no
malice
spat
in
their
faces
to
make
them
let
go
then
soldiers
appeared
undersized
men
wearing
each
a
knapsack
covered
with
mangy
fur
and
a
which
had
been
cut
for
some
larger
soldier
beside
them
walked
officers
looking
foolish
and
fierce
and
before
them
went
little
boys
turning
somersaults
in
time
with
the
band
the
tramcar
became
entangled
in
their
ranks
and
moved
on
painfully
like
a
caterpillar
in
a
swarm
of
ants
one
of
the
little
boys
fell
down
and
some
white
bullocks
came
out
of
an
archway
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
good
advice
of
an
old
man
who
was
selling
the
road
might
never
have
got
clear
over
such
trivialities
as
these
many
a
valuable
hour
may
slip
away
and
the
traveller
who
has
gone
to
italy
to
study
the
tactile
values
of
giotto
or
the
corruption
of
the
papacy
may
return
remembering
nothing
but
the
blue
sky
and
the
men
and
women
who
live
under
it
so
it
was
as
well
that
miss
bartlett
should
tap
and
come
in
and
having
commented
on
lucy
s
leaving
the
door
unlocked
and
on
her
leaning
out
of
the
window
before
she
was
fully
dressed
should
urge
her
to
hasten
herself
or
the
best
of
the
day
would
be
gone
by
the
time
lucy
was
ready
her
cousin
had
done
her
breakfast
and
was
listening
to
the
clever
lady
among
the
crumbs
a
conversation
then
ensued
on
not
unfamiliar
lines
miss
bartlett
was
after
all
a
wee
bit
tired
and
thought
they
had
better
spend
the
morning
settling
in
unless
lucy
would
at
all
like
to
go
out
lucy
would
rather
like
to
go
out
as
it
was
her
first
day
in
florence
but
of
course
she
could
go
alone
miss
bartlett
could
not
allow
this
of
course
she
would
accompany
lucy
everywhere
oh
certainly
not
lucy
would
stop
with
her
cousin
oh
no
that
would
never
do
oh
yes
at
this
point
the
clever
lady
broke
in
if
it
is
grundy
who
is
troubling
you
i
do
assure
you
that
you
can
neglect
the
good
person
being
english
miss
honeychurch
will
be
perfectly
safe
italians
understand
a
dear
friend
of
mine
contessa
baroncelli
has
two
daughters
and
when
she
can
not
send
a
maid
to
school
with
them
she
lets
them
go
in
instead
every
one
takes
them
for
english
you
see
especially
if
their
hair
is
strained
tightly
miss
bartlett
was
unconvinced
by
the
safety
of
contessa
baroncelli
s
daughters
she
was
determined
to
take
lucy
herself
her
head
not
being
so
very
bad
the
clever
lady
then
said
that
she
was
going
to
spend
a
long
morning
in
santa
croce
and
if
lucy
would
come
too
she
would
be
delighted
i
will
take
you
by
a
dear
dirty
back
way
miss
honeychurch
and
if
you
bring
me
luck
we
shall
have
an
lucy
said
that
this
was
most
kind
and
at
once
opened
the
baedeker
to
see
where
santa
croce
was
tut
tut
miss
lucy
i
hope
we
shall
soon
emancipate
you
from
baedeker
he
does
but
touch
the
surface
of
things
as
to
the
true
italy
he
does
not
even
dream
of
it
the
true
italy
is
only
to
be
found
by
patient
this
sounded
very
interesting
and
lucy
hurried
over
her
breakfast
and
started
with
her
new
friend
in
high
spirits
italy
was
coming
at
last
the
cockney
signora
and
her
works
had
vanished
like
a
bad
dream
miss
lavish
for
that
was
the
clever
lady
s
name
turned
to
the
right
along
the
sunny
lung
arno
how
delightfully
warm
but
a
wind
down
the
side
streets
cut
like
a
knife
didn
t
it
ponte
alle
grazie
particularly
interesting
mentioned
by
dante
san
miniato
beautiful
as
well
as
interesting
the
crucifix
that
kissed
a
murderer
miss
honeychurch
would
remember
the
story
the
men
on
the
river
were
fishing
untrue
but
then
so
is
most
information
then
miss
lavish
darted
under
the
archway
of
the
white
bullocks
and
she
stopped
and
she
cried
a
smell
a
true
florentine
smell
every
city
let
me
teach
you
has
its
own
is
it
a
very
nice
smell
said
lucy
who
had
inherited
from
her
mother
a
distaste
to
dirt
one
doesn
t
come
to
italy
for
niceness
was
the
retort
one
comes
for
life
buon
giorno
buon
giorno
bowing
right
and
left
look
at
that
adorable
how
the
driver
stares
at
us
dear
simple
soul
so
miss
lavish
proceeded
through
the
streets
of
the
city
of
florence
short
fidgety
and
playful
as
a
kitten
though
without
a
kitten
s
grace
it
was
a
treat
for
the
girl
to
be
with
any
one
so
clever
and
so
cheerful
and
a
blue
military
cloak
such
as
an
italian
officer
wears
only
increased
the
sense
of
festivity
buon
giorno
take
the
word
of
an
old
woman
miss
lucy
you
will
never
repent
of
a
little
civility
to
your
inferiors
that
is
the
true
democracy
though
i
am
a
real
radical
as
well
there
now
you
re
indeed
i
m
not
exclaimed
lucy
we
are
radicals
too
out
and
out
my
father
always
voted
for
gladstone
until
he
was
so
dreadful
about
i
see
i
see
and
now
you
have
gone
over
to
the
oh
please
if
my
father
was
alive
i
am
sure
he
would
vote
radical
again
now
that
ireland
is
all
right
and
as
it
is
the
glass
over
our
front
door
was
broken
last
election
and
freddy
is
sure
it
was
the
tories
but
mother
says
nonsense
a
shameful
a
manufacturing
district
i
suppose
no
in
the
surrey
hills
about
five
miles
from
dorking
looking
over
the
miss
lavish
seemed
interested
and
slackened
her
trot
what
a
delightful
part
i
know
it
so
well
it
is
full
of
the
very
nicest
people
do
you
know
sir
harry
otway
a
radical
if
ever
there
was
very
well
and
old
butterworth
the
philanthropist
why
she
rents
a
field
of
us
how
funny
miss
lavish
looked
at
the
narrow
ribbon
of
sky
and
murmured
oh
you
have
property
in
surrey
hardly
any
said
lucy
fearful
of
being
thought
a
snob
only
thirty
acres
just
the
garden
all
downhill
and
some
miss
lavish
was
not
disgusted
and
said
it
was
just
the
size
of
her
aunt
s
suffolk
estate
italy
receded
they
tried
to
remember
the
last
name
of
lady
louisa
someone
who
had
taken
a
house
near
summer
street
the
other
year
but
she
had
not
liked
it
which
was
odd
of
her
and
just
as
miss
lavish
had
got
the
name
she
broke
off
and
exclaimed
bless
us
bless
us
and
save
us
we
ve
lost
the
certainly
they
had
seemed
a
long
time
in
reaching
santa
croce
the
tower
of
which
had
been
plainly
visible
from
the
landing
window
but
miss
lavish
had
said
so
much
about
knowing
her
florence
by
heart
that
lucy
had
followed
her
with
no
misgivings
lost
lost
my
dear
miss
lucy
during
our
political
diatribes
we
have
taken
a
wrong
turning
how
those
horrid
conservatives
would
jeer
at
us
what
are
we
to
do
two
lone
females
in
an
unknown
town
now
this
is
what
i
call
an
lucy
who
wanted
to
see
santa
croce
suggested
as
a
possible
solution
that
they
should
ask
the
way
there
oh
but
that
is
the
word
of
a
craven
and
no
you
are
not
not
not
to
look
at
your
baedeker
give
it
to
me
i
shan
t
let
you
carry
it
we
will
simply
accordingly
they
drifted
through
a
series
of
those
streets
neither
commodious
nor
picturesque
in
which
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
city
abounds
lucy
soon
lost
interest
in
the
discontent
of
lady
louisa
and
became
discontented
herself
for
one
ravishing
moment
italy
appeared
she
stood
in
the
square
of
the
annunziata
and
saw
in
the
living
those
divine
babies
whom
no
cheap
reproduction
can
ever
stale
there
they
stood
with
their
shining
limbs
bursting
from
the
garments
of
charity
and
their
strong
white
arms
extended
against
circlets
of
heaven
lucy
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
but
miss
lavish
with
a
shriek
of
dismay
dragged
her
forward
declaring
that
they
were
out
of
their
path
now
by
at
least
a
mile
the
hour
was
approaching
at
which
the
continental
breakfast
begins
or
rather
ceases
to
tell
and
the
ladies
bought
some
hot
chestnut
paste
out
of
a
little
shop
because
it
looked
so
typical
it
tasted
partly
of
the
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
partly
of
hair
oil
partly
of
the
great
unknown
but
it
gave
them
strength
to
drift
into
another
piazza
large
and
dusty
on
the
farther
side
of
which
rose
a
facade
of
surpassing
ugliness
miss
lavish
spoke
to
it
dramatically
it
was
santa
croce
the
adventure
was
over
stop
a
minute
let
those
two
people
go
on
or
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
them
i
do
detest
conventional
intercourse
nasty
they
are
going
into
the
church
too
oh
the
britisher
abroad
we
sat
opposite
them
at
dinner
last
night
they
have
given
us
their
rooms
they
were
so
very
look
at
their
figures
laughed
miss
lavish
they
walk
through
my
italy
like
a
pair
of
cows
it
s
very
naughty
of
me
but
i
would
like
to
set
an
examination
paper
at
dover
and
turn
back
every
tourist
who
couldn
t
pass
what
would
you
ask
us
miss
lavish
laid
her
hand
pleasantly
on
lucy
s
arm
as
if
to
suggest
that
she
at
all
events
would
get
full
marks
in
this
exalted
mood
they
reached
the
steps
of
the
great
church
and
were
about
to
enter
it
when
miss
lavish
stopped
squeaked
flung
up
her
arms
and
cried
there
goes
my
box
i
must
have
a
word
with
him
and
in
a
moment
she
was
away
over
the
piazza
her
military
cloak
flapping
in
the
wind
nor
did
she
slacken
speed
till
she
caught
up
an
old
man
with
white
whiskers
and
nipped
him
playfully
upon
the
arm
lucy
waited
for
nearly
ten
minutes
then
she
began
to
get
tired
the
beggars
worried
her
the
dust
blew
in
her
eyes
and
she
remembered
that
a
young
girl
ought
not
to
loiter
in
public
places
she
descended
slowly
into
the
piazza
with
the
intention
of
rejoining
miss
lavish
who
was
really
almost
too
original
but
at
that
moment
miss
lavish
and
her
box
moved
also
and
disappeared
down
a
side
street
both
gesticulating
largely
tears
of
indignation
came
to
lucy
s
eyes
partly
because
miss
lavish
had
jilted
her
partly
because
she
had
taken
her
baedeker
how
could
she
find
her
way
home
how
could
she
find
her
way
about
in
santa
croce
her
first
morning
was
ruined
and
she
might
never
be
in
florence
again
a
few
minutes
ago
she
had
been
all
high
spirits
talking
as
a
woman
of
culture
and
half
persuading
herself
that
she
was
full
of
originality
now
she
entered
the
church
depressed
and
humiliated
not
even
able
to
remember
whether
it
was
built
by
the
franciscans
or
the
dominicans
of
course
it
must
be
a
wonderful
building
but
how
like
a
barn
and
how
very
cold
of
course
it
contained
frescoes
by
giotto
in
the
presence
of
whose
tactile
values
she
was
capable
of
feeling
what
was
proper
but
who
was
to
tell
her
which
they
were
she
walked
about
disdainfully
unwilling
to
be
enthusiastic
over
monuments
of
uncertain
authorship
or
date
there
was
no
one
even
to
tell
her
which
of
all
the
sepulchral
slabs
that
paved
the
nave
and
transepts
was
the
one
that
was
really
beautiful
the
one
that
had
been
most
praised
by
ruskin
then
the
pernicious
charm
of
italy
worked
on
her
and
instead
of
acquiring
information
she
began
to
be
happy
she
puzzled
out
the
italian
notices
the
notices
that
forbade
people
to
introduce
dogs
into
the
church
the
notice
that
prayed
people
in
the
interest
of
health
and
out
of
respect
to
the
sacred
edifice
in
which
they
found
themselves
not
to
spit
she
watched
the
tourists
their
noses
were
as
red
as
their
baedekers
so
cold
was
santa
croce
she
beheld
the
horrible
fate
that
overtook
three
papists
two
and
a
who
began
their
career
by
sousing
each
other
with
the
holy
water
and
then
proceeded
to
the
machiavelli
memorial
dripping
but
hallowed
advancing
towards
it
very
slowly
and
from
immense
distances
they
touched
the
stone
with
their
fingers
with
their
handkerchiefs
with
their
heads
and
then
retreated
what
could
this
mean
they
did
it
again
and
again
then
lucy
realized
that
they
had
mistaken
machiavelli
for
some
saint
hoping
to
acquire
virtue
punishment
followed
quickly
the
smallest
stumbled
over
one
of
the
sepulchral
slabs
so
much
admired
by
ruskin
and
entangled
his
feet
in
the
features
of
a
recumbent
bishop
protestant
as
she
was
lucy
darted
forward
she
was
too
late
he
fell
heavily
upon
the
prelate
s
upturned
toes
hateful
bishop
exclaimed
the
voice
of
old
emerson
who
had
darted
forward
also
hard
in
life
hard
in
death
go
out
into
the
sunshine
little
boy
and
kiss
your
hand
to
the
sun
for
that
is
where
you
ought
to
be
intolerable
bishop
the
child
screamed
frantically
at
these
words
and
at
these
dreadful
people
who
picked
him
up
dusted
him
rubbed
his
bruises
and
told
him
not
to
be
superstitious
look
at
him
said
emerson
to
lucy
here
s
a
mess
a
baby
hurt
cold
and
frightened
but
what
else
can
you
expect
from
a
church
the
child
s
legs
had
become
as
melting
wax
each
time
that
old
emerson
and
lucy
set
it
erect
it
collapsed
with
a
roar
fortunately
an
italian
lady
who
ought
to
have
been
saying
her
prayers
came
to
the
rescue
by
some
mysterious
virtue
which
mothers
alone
possess
she
stiffened
the
little
boy
s
and
imparted
strength
to
his
knees
he
stood
still
gibbering
with
agitation
he
walked
away
you
are
a
clever
woman
said
emerson
you
have
done
more
than
all
the
relics
in
the
world
i
am
not
of
your
creed
but
i
do
believe
in
those
who
make
their
happy
there
is
no
scheme
of
the
universe
he
paused
for
a
phrase
niente
said
the
italian
lady
and
returned
to
her
prayers
i
m
not
sure
she
understands
english
suggested
lucy
in
her
chastened
mood
she
no
longer
despised
the
emersons
she
was
determined
to
be
gracious
to
them
beautiful
rather
than
delicate
and
if
possible
to
erase
miss
bartlett
s
civility
by
some
gracious
reference
to
the
pleasant
rooms
that
woman
understands
everything
was
emerson
s
reply
but
what
are
you
doing
here
are
you
doing
the
church
are
you
through
with
the
church
no
cried
lucy
remembering
her
grievance
i
came
here
with
miss
lavish
who
was
to
explain
everything
and
just
by
the
door
it
is
too
bad
she
simply
ran
away
and
after
waiting
quite
a
time
i
had
to
come
in
by
why
shouldn
t
you
said
emerson
yes
why
shouldn
t
you
come
by
yourself
said
the
son
addressing
the
young
lady
for
the
first
time
but
miss
lavish
has
even
taken
away
baedeker
said
emerson
i
m
glad
it
s
that
you
minded
it
s
worth
minding
the
loss
of
a
baedeker
that
s
worth
lucy
was
puzzled
she
was
again
conscious
of
some
new
idea
and
was
not
sure
whither
it
would
lead
her
if
you
ve
no
baedeker
said
the
son
you
d
better
join
was
this
where
the
idea
would
lead
she
took
refuge
in
her
dignity
thank
you
very
much
but
i
could
not
think
of
that
i
hope
you
do
not
suppose
that
i
came
to
join
on
to
you
i
really
came
to
help
with
the
child
and
to
thank
you
for
so
kindly
giving
us
your
rooms
last
night
i
hope
that
you
have
not
been
put
to
any
great
my
dear
said
the
old
man
gently
i
think
that
you
are
repeating
what
you
have
heard
older
people
say
you
are
pretending
to
be
touchy
but
you
are
not
really
stop
being
so
tiresome
and
tell
me
instead
what
part
of
the
church
you
want
to
see
to
take
you
to
it
will
be
a
real
now
this
was
abominably
impertinent
and
she
ought
to
have
been
furious
but
it
is
sometimes
as
difficult
to
lose
one
s
temper
as
it
is
difficult
at
other
times
to
keep
it
lucy
could
not
get
cross
emerson
was
an
old
man
and
surely
a
girl
might
humour
him
on
the
other
hand
his
son
was
a
young
man
and
she
felt
that
a
girl
ought
to
be
offended
with
him
or
at
all
events
be
offended
before
him
it
was
at
him
that
she
gazed
before
replying
i
am
not
touchy
i
hope
it
is
the
giottos
that
i
want
to
see
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
which
they
the
son
nodded
with
a
look
of
sombre
satisfaction
he
led
the
way
to
the
peruzzi
chapel
there
was
a
hint
of
the
teacher
about
him
she
felt
like
a
child
in
school
who
had
answered
a
question
rightly
the
chapel
was
already
filled
with
an
earnest
congregation
and
out
of
them
rose
the
voice
of
a
lecturer
directing
them
how
to
worship
giotto
not
by
tactful
valuations
but
by
the
standards
of
the
spirit
remember
he
was
saying
the
facts
about
this
church
of
santa
croce
how
it
was
built
by
faith
in
the
full
fervour
of
medievalism
before
any
taint
of
the
renaissance
had
appeared
observe
how
giotto
in
these
frescoes
now
unhappily
ruined
by
restoration
is
untroubled
by
the
snares
of
anatomy
and
perspective
could
anything
be
more
majestic
more
pathetic
beautiful
true
how
little
we
feel
avails
knowledge
and
technical
cleverness
against
a
man
who
truly
feels
no
exclaimed
emerson
in
much
too
loud
a
voice
for
church
remember
nothing
of
the
sort
built
by
faith
indeed
that
simply
means
the
workmen
weren
t
paid
properly
and
as
for
the
frescoes
i
see
no
truth
in
them
look
at
that
fat
man
in
blue
he
must
weigh
as
much
as
i
do
and
he
is
shooting
into
the
sky
like
an
air
he
was
referring
to
the
fresco
of
the
ascension
of
inside
the
lecturer
s
voice
faltered
as
well
it
might
the
audience
shifted
uneasily
and
so
did
lucy
she
was
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
be
with
these
men
but
they
had
cast
a
spell
over
her
they
were
so
serious
and
so
strange
that
she
could
not
remember
how
to
behave
now
did
this
happen
or
didn
t
it
yes
or
no
george
replied
it
happened
like
this
if
it
happened
at
all
i
would
rather
go
up
to
heaven
by
myself
than
be
pushed
by
cherubs
and
if
i
got
there
i
should
like
my
friends
to
lean
out
of
it
just
as
they
do
you
will
never
go
up
said
his
father
you
and
i
dear
boy
will
lie
at
peace
in
the
earth
that
bore
us
and
our
names
will
disappear
as
surely
as
our
work
some
of
the
people
can
only
see
the
empty
grave
not
the
saint
whoever
he
is
going
up
it
did
happen
like
that
if
it
happened
at
pardon
me
said
a
frigid
voice
the
chapel
is
somewhat
small
for
two
parties
we
will
incommode
you
no
the
lecturer
was
a
clergyman
and
his
audience
must
be
also
his
flock
for
they
held
as
well
as
in
their
hands
they
filed
out
of
the
chapel
in
silence
amongst
them
were
the
two
little
old
ladies
of
the
pension
bertolini
miss
teresa
and
miss
catherine
alan
stop
cried
emerson
there
s
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
stop
the
procession
disappeared
without
a
word
soon
the
lecturer
could
be
heard
in
the
next
chapel
describing
the
life
of
francis
george
i
do
believe
that
clergyman
is
the
brixton
george
went
into
the
next
chapel
and
returned
saying
perhaps
he
is
i
don
t
then
i
had
better
speak
to
him
and
remind
him
who
i
am
it
s
that
mr
eager
why
did
he
go
did
we
talk
too
loud
how
vexatious
i
shall
go
and
say
we
are
sorry
hadn
t
i
better
then
perhaps
he
will
come
he
will
not
come
back
said
george
but
emerson
contrite
and
unhappy
hurried
away
to
apologize
to
the
rev
cuthbert
eager
lucy
apparently
absorbed
in
a
lunette
could
hear
the
lecture
again
interrupted
the
anxious
aggressive
voice
of
the
old
man
the
curt
injured
replies
of
his
opponent
the
son
who
took
every
little
contretemps
as
if
it
were
a
tragedy
was
listening
also
my
father
has
that
effect
on
nearly
everyone
he
informed
her
he
will
try
to
be
i
hope
we
all
try
said
she
smiling
nervously
because
we
think
it
improves
our
characters
but
he
is
kind
to
people
because
he
loves
them
and
they
find
him
out
and
are
offended
or
how
silly
of
them
said
lucy
though
in
her
heart
she
sympathized
i
think
that
a
kind
action
done
tactfully
tact
he
threw
up
his
head
in
disdain
apparently
she
had
given
the
wrong
answer
she
watched
the
singular
creature
pace
up
and
down
the
chapel
for
a
young
man
his
face
was
rugged
and
until
the
shadows
fell
upon
it
hard
enshadowed
it
sprang
into
tenderness
she
saw
him
once
again
at
rome
on
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel
carrying
a
burden
of
acorns
healthy
and
muscular
he
yet
gave
her
the
feeling
of
greyness
of
tragedy
that
might
only
find
solution
in
the
night
the
feeling
soon
passed
it
was
unlike
her
to
have
entertained
anything
so
subtle
born
of
silence
and
of
unknown
emotion
it
passed
when
emerson
returned
and
she
could
the
world
of
rapid
talk
which
was
alone
familiar
to
her
were
you
snubbed
asked
his
son
tranquilly
but
we
have
spoilt
the
pleasure
of
i
don
t
know
how
many
people
they
won
t
come
full
of
innate
sympathy
quickness
to
perceive
good
in
others
vision
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
scraps
of
the
lecture
on
francis
came
floating
round
the
partition
wall
don
t
let
us
spoil
yours
he
continued
to
lucy
have
you
looked
at
those
saints
yes
said
lucy
they
are
lovely
do
you
know
which
is
the
tombstone
that
is
praised
in
ruskin
he
did
not
know
and
suggested
that
they
should
try
to
guess
it
george
rather
to
her
relief
refused
to
move
and
she
and
the
old
man
wandered
not
unpleasantly
about
santa
croce
which
though
it
is
like
a
barn
has
harvested
many
beautiful
things
inside
its
walls
there
were
also
beggars
to
avoid
and
guides
to
dodge
round
the
pillars
and
an
old
lady
with
her
dog
and
here
and
there
a
priest
modestly
edging
to
his
mass
through
the
groups
of
tourists
but
emerson
was
only
half
interested
he
watched
the
lecturer
whose
success
he
believed
he
had
impaired
and
then
he
anxiously
watched
his
son
why
will
he
look
at
that
fresco
he
said
uneasily
i
saw
nothing
in
i
like
giotto
she
replied
it
is
so
wonderful
what
they
say
about
his
tactile
values
though
i
like
things
like
the
della
robbia
babies
so
you
ought
a
baby
is
worth
a
dozen
saints
and
my
baby
s
worth
the
whole
of
paradise
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
lives
in
lucy
again
felt
that
this
did
not
do
in
hell
he
repeated
he
s
oh
dear
said
lucy
how
can
he
be
unhappy
when
he
is
strong
and
alive
what
more
is
one
to
give
him
and
think
how
he
has
been
brought
up
free
from
all
the
superstition
and
ignorance
that
lead
men
to
hate
one
another
in
the
name
of
god
with
such
an
education
as
that
i
thought
he
was
bound
to
grow
up
she
was
no
theologian
but
she
felt
that
here
was
a
very
foolish
old
man
as
well
as
a
very
irreligious
one
she
also
felt
that
her
mother
might
not
like
her
talking
to
that
kind
of
person
and
that
charlotte
would
object
most
strongly
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
he
asked
he
comes
out
for
his
holiday
to
italy
and
behaves
like
that
like
the
little
child
who
ought
to
have
been
playing
and
who
hurt
himself
upon
the
tombstone
eh
what
did
you
say
lucy
had
made
no
suggestion
suddenly
he
said
now
don
t
be
stupid
over
this
i
don
t
require
you
to
fall
in
love
with
my
boy
but
i
do
think
you
might
try
and
understand
him
you
are
nearer
his
age
and
if
you
let
yourself
go
i
am
sure
you
are
sensible
you
might
help
me
he
has
known
so
few
women
and
you
have
the
time
you
stop
here
several
weeks
i
suppose
but
let
yourself
go
you
are
inclined
to
get
muddled
if
i
may
judge
from
last
night
let
yourself
go
pull
out
from
the
depths
those
thoughts
that
you
do
not
understand
and
spread
them
out
in
the
sunlight
and
know
the
meaning
of
them
by
understanding
george
you
may
learn
to
understand
yourself
it
will
be
good
for
both
of
to
this
extraordinary
speech
lucy
found
no
answer
i
only
know
what
it
is
that
s
wrong
with
him
not
why
it
and
what
is
it
asked
lucy
fearfully
expecting
some
harrowing
tale
the
old
trouble
things
won
t
what
things
the
things
of
the
universe
it
is
quite
true
they
don
oh
emerson
whatever
do
you
mean
in
his
ordinary
voice
so
that
she
scarcely
realized
he
was
quoting
poetry
he
said
from
far
from
eve
and
morning
and
yon
sky
the
stuff
of
life
to
knit
me
blew
hither
here
am
i
george
and
i
both
know
this
but
why
does
it
distress
him
we
know
that
we
come
from
the
winds
and
that
we
shall
return
to
them
that
all
life
is
perhaps
a
knot
a
tangle
a
blemish
in
the
eternal
smoothness
but
why
should
this
make
us
unhappy
let
us
rather
love
one
another
and
work
and
rejoice
i
don
t
believe
in
this
world
miss
honeychurch
assented
then
make
my
boy
think
like
us
make
him
realize
that
by
the
side
of
the
everlasting
why
there
is
a
yes
a
transitory
yes
if
you
like
but
a
suddenly
she
laughed
surely
one
ought
to
laugh
a
young
man
melancholy
because
the
universe
wouldn
t
fit
because
life
was
a
tangle
or
a
wind
or
a
yes
or
something
i
m
very
sorry
she
cried
you
ll
think
me
unfeeling
but
but
then
she
became
matronly
oh
but
your
son
wants
employment
has
he
no
particular
hobby
why
i
myself
have
worries
but
i
can
generally
forget
them
at
the
piano
and
collecting
stamps
did
no
end
of
good
for
my
brother
perhaps
italy
bores
him
you
ought
to
try
the
alps
or
the
the
old
man
s
face
saddened
and
he
touched
her
gently
with
his
hand
this
did
not
alarm
her
she
thought
that
her
advice
had
impressed
him
and
that
he
was
thanking
her
for
it
indeed
he
no
longer
alarmed
her
at
all
she
regarded
him
as
a
kind
thing
but
quite
silly
her
feelings
were
as
inflated
spiritually
as
they
had
been
an
hour
ago
esthetically
before
she
lost
baedeker
the
dear
george
now
striding
towards
them
over
the
tombstones
seemed
both
pitiable
and
absurd
he
approached
his
face
in
the
shadow
he
said
miss
oh
good
gracious
me
said
lucy
suddenly
collapsing
and
again
seeing
the
whole
of
life
in
a
new
perspective
where
where
in
the
i
see
those
gossiping
little
miss
alans
must
have
she
checked
herself
poor
girl
exploded
emerson
poor
girl
she
could
not
let
this
pass
for
it
was
just
what
she
was
feeling
herself
poor
girl
i
fail
to
understand
the
point
of
that
remark
i
think
myself
a
very
fortunate
girl
i
assure
you
i
m
thoroughly
happy
and
having
a
splendid
time
pray
don
t
waste
time
mourning
over
me
there
s
enough
sorrow
in
the
world
isn
t
there
without
trying
to
invent
it
thank
you
both
so
much
for
all
your
kindness
ah
yes
there
does
come
my
cousin
a
delightful
morning
santa
croce
is
a
wonderful
she
joined
her
cousin
chapter
iii
music
violets
and
the
letter
s
it
so
happened
that
lucy
who
found
daily
life
rather
chaotic
entered
a
more
solid
world
when
she
opened
the
piano
she
was
then
no
longer
either
deferential
or
patronizing
no
longer
either
a
rebel
or
a
slave
the
kingdom
of
music
is
not
the
kingdom
of
this
world
it
will
accept
those
whom
breeding
and
intellect
and
culture
have
alike
rejected
the
commonplace
person
begins
to
play
and
shoots
into
the
empyrean
without
effort
whilst
we
look
up
marvelling
how
he
has
escaped
us
and
thinking
how
we
could
worship
him
and
love
him
would
he
but
translate
his
visions
into
human
words
and
his
experiences
into
human
actions
perhaps
he
can
not
certainly
he
does
not
or
does
so
very
seldom
lucy
had
done
so
never
she
was
no
dazzling
executante
her
runs
were
not
at
all
like
strings
of
pearls
and
she
struck
no
more
right
notes
than
was
suitable
for
one
of
her
age
and
situation
nor
was
she
the
passionate
young
lady
who
performs
so
tragically
on
a
summer
s
evening
with
the
window
open
passion
was
there
but
it
could
not
be
easily
labelled
it
slipped
between
love
and
hatred
and
jealousy
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
pictorial
style
and
she
was
tragical
only
in
the
sense
that
she
was
great
for
she
loved
to
play
on
the
side
of
victory
victory
of
what
and
over
what
that
is
more
than
the
words
of
daily
life
can
tell
us
but
that
some
sonatas
of
beethoven
are
written
tragic
no
one
can
gainsay
yet
they
can
triumph
or
despair
as
the
player
decides
and
lucy
had
decided
that
they
should
triumph
a
very
wet
afternoon
at
the
bertolini
permitted
her
to
do
the
thing
she
really
liked
and
after
lunch
she
opened
the
little
draped
piano
a
few
people
lingered
round
and
praised
her
playing
but
finding
that
she
made
no
reply
dispersed
to
their
rooms
to
write
up
their
diaries
or
to
sleep
she
took
no
notice
of
emerson
looking
for
his
son
nor
of
miss
bartlett
looking
for
miss
lavish
nor
of
miss
lavish
looking
for
her
like
every
true
performer
she
was
intoxicated
by
the
mere
feel
of
the
notes
they
were
fingers
caressing
her
own
and
by
touch
not
by
sound
alone
did
she
come
to
her
desire
beebe
sitting
unnoticed
in
the
window
pondered
this
illogical
element
in
miss
honeychurch
and
recalled
the
occasion
at
tunbridge
wells
when
he
had
discovered
it
it
was
at
one
of
those
entertainments
where
the
upper
classes
entertain
the
lower
the
seats
were
filled
with
a
respectful
audience
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
parish
under
the
auspices
of
their
vicar
sang
or
recited
or
imitated
the
drawing
of
a
champagne
cork
among
the
promised
items
was
miss
honeychurch
piano
beethoven
and
beebe
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
adelaida
or
the
march
of
the
ruins
of
athens
when
his
composure
was
disturbed
by
the
opening
bars
of
opus
iii
he
was
in
suspense
all
through
the
introduction
for
not
until
the
pace
quickens
does
one
know
what
the
performer
intends
with
the
roar
of
the
opening
theme
he
knew
that
things
were
going
extraordinarily
in
the
chords
that
herald
the
conclusion
he
heard
the
hammer
strokes
of
victory
he
was
glad
that
she
only
played
the
first
movement
for
he
could
have
paid
no
attention
to
the
winding
intricacies
of
the
measures
of
the
audience
clapped
no
less
respectful
it
was
beebe
who
started
the
stamping
it
was
all
that
one
could
do
who
is
she
he
asked
the
vicar
afterwards
cousin
of
one
of
my
parishioners
i
do
not
consider
her
choice
of
a
piece
happy
beethoven
is
so
usually
simple
and
direct
in
his
appeal
that
it
is
sheer
perversity
to
choose
a
thing
like
that
which
if
anything
introduce
she
will
be
delighted
she
and
miss
bartlett
are
full
of
the
praises
of
your
my
sermon
cried
beebe
why
ever
did
she
listen
to
it
when
he
was
introduced
he
understood
why
for
miss
honeychurch
disjoined
from
her
music
stool
was
only
a
young
lady
with
a
quantity
of
dark
hair
and
a
very
pretty
pale
undeveloped
face
she
loved
going
to
concerts
she
loved
stopping
with
her
cousin
she
loved
iced
coffee
and
meringues
he
did
not
doubt
that
she
loved
his
sermon
also
but
before
he
left
tunbridge
wells
he
made
a
remark
to
the
vicar
which
he
now
made
to
lucy
herself
when
she
closed
the
little
piano
and
moved
dreamily
towards
him
if
miss
honeychurch
ever
takes
to
live
as
she
plays
it
will
be
very
exciting
both
for
us
and
for
lucy
at
once
daily
life
oh
what
a
funny
thing
some
one
said
just
the
same
to
mother
and
she
said
she
trusted
i
should
never
live
a
doesn
t
honeychurch
like
music
she
doesn
t
mind
it
but
she
doesn
t
like
one
to
get
excited
over
anything
she
thinks
i
am
silly
about
it
she
thinks
i
can
t
make
out
once
you
know
i
said
that
i
liked
my
own
playing
better
than
any
one
s
she
has
never
got
over
it
of
course
i
didn
t
mean
that
i
played
well
i
only
meant
of
course
said
he
wondering
why
she
bothered
to
explain
music
said
lucy
as
if
attempting
some
generality
she
could
not
complete
it
and
looked
out
absently
upon
italy
in
the
wet
the
whole
life
of
the
south
was
disorganized
and
the
most
graceful
nation
in
europe
had
turned
into
formless
lumps
of
clothes
the
street
and
the
river
were
dirty
yellow
the
bridge
was
dirty
grey
and
the
hills
were
dirty
purple
somewhere
in
their
folds
were
concealed
miss
lavish
and
miss
bartlett
who
had
chosen
this
afternoon
to
visit
the
torre
del
gallo
what
about
music
said
beebe
poor
charlotte
will
be
sopped
was
lucy
s
reply
the
expedition
was
typical
of
miss
bartlett
who
would
return
cold
tired
hungry
and
angelic
with
a
ruined
skirt
a
pulpy
baedeker
and
a
tickling
cough
in
her
throat
on
another
day
when
the
whole
world
was
singing
and
the
air
ran
into
the
mouth
like
wine
she
would
refuse
to
stir
from
the
saying
that
she
was
an
old
thing
and
no
fit
companion
for
a
hearty
girl
miss
lavish
has
led
your
cousin
astray
she
hopes
to
find
the
true
italy
in
the
wet
i
miss
lavish
is
so
original
murmured
lucy
this
was
a
stock
remark
the
supreme
achievement
of
the
pension
bertolini
in
the
way
of
definition
miss
lavish
was
so
original
beebe
had
his
doubts
but
they
would
have
been
put
down
to
clerical
narrowness
for
that
and
for
other
reasons
he
held
his
peace
is
it
true
continued
lucy
in
tone
that
miss
lavish
is
writing
a
book
they
do
say
what
is
it
about
it
will
be
a
novel
replied
beebe
dealing
with
modern
italy
let
me
refer
you
for
an
account
to
miss
catharine
alan
who
uses
words
herself
more
admirably
than
any
one
i
i
wish
miss
lavish
would
tell
me
herself
we
started
such
friends
but
i
don
t
think
she
ought
to
have
run
away
with
baedeker
that
morning
in
santa
croce
charlotte
was
most
annoyed
at
finding
me
practically
alone
and
so
i
couldn
t
help
being
a
little
annoyed
with
miss
the
two
ladies
at
all
events
have
made
it
he
was
interested
in
the
sudden
friendship
between
women
so
apparently
dissimilar
as
miss
bartlett
and
miss
lavish
they
were
always
in
each
other
s
company
with
lucy
a
slighted
third
miss
lavish
he
believed
he
understood
but
miss
bartlett
might
reveal
unknown
depths
of
strangeness
though
not
perhaps
of
meaning
was
italy
deflecting
her
from
the
path
of
prim
chaperon
which
he
had
assigned
to
her
at
tunbridge
wells
all
his
life
he
had
loved
to
study
maiden
ladies
they
were
his
specialty
and
his
profession
had
provided
him
with
ample
opportunities
for
the
work
girls
like
lucy
were
charming
to
look
at
but
beebe
was
from
rather
profound
reasons
somewhat
chilly
in
his
attitude
towards
the
other
sex
and
preferred
to
be
interested
rather
than
enthralled
lucy
for
the
third
time
said
that
poor
charlotte
would
be
sopped
the
arno
was
rising
in
flood
washing
away
the
traces
of
the
little
carts
upon
the
foreshore
but
in
the
there
had
appeared
a
dull
haze
of
yellow
which
might
mean
better
weather
if
it
did
not
mean
worse
she
opened
the
window
to
inspect
and
a
cold
blast
entered
the
room
drawing
a
plaintive
cry
from
miss
catharine
alan
who
entered
at
the
same
moment
by
the
door
oh
dear
miss
honeychurch
you
will
catch
a
chill
and
beebe
here
besides
who
would
suppose
this
is
italy
there
is
my
sister
actually
nursing
the
can
no
comforts
or
proper
she
sidled
towards
them
and
sat
down
as
she
always
was
on
entering
a
room
which
contained
one
man
or
a
man
and
one
woman
i
could
hear
your
beautiful
playing
miss
honeychurch
though
i
was
in
my
room
with
the
door
shut
doors
shut
indeed
most
necessary
no
one
has
the
least
idea
of
privacy
in
this
country
and
one
person
catches
it
from
lucy
answered
suitably
beebe
was
not
able
to
tell
the
ladies
of
his
adventure
at
modena
where
the
chambermaid
burst
in
upon
him
in
his
bath
exclaiming
cheerfully
fa
niente
sono
he
contented
himself
with
saying
i
quite
agree
with
you
miss
alan
the
italians
are
a
most
unpleasant
people
they
pry
everywhere
they
see
everything
and
they
know
what
we
want
before
we
know
it
ourselves
we
are
at
their
mercy
they
read
our
thoughts
they
foretell
our
desires
from
the
down
to
to
giotto
they
turn
us
inside
out
and
i
resent
it
yet
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
are
how
superficial
they
have
no
conception
of
the
intellectual
life
how
right
is
signora
bertolini
who
exclaimed
to
me
the
other
day
ho
beebe
if
you
knew
what
i
suffer
over
the
children
s
edjucaishion
hi
won
t
ave
my
little
victorier
taught
by
a
hignorant
italian
what
can
t
explain
nothink
miss
alan
did
not
follow
but
gathered
that
she
was
being
mocked
in
an
agreeable
way
her
sister
was
a
little
disappointed
in
beebe
having
expected
better
things
from
a
clergyman
whose
head
was
bald
and
who
wore
a
pair
of
russet
whiskers
indeed
who
would
have
supposed
that
tolerance
sympathy
and
a
sense
of
humour
would
inhabit
that
militant
form
in
the
midst
of
her
satisfaction
she
continued
to
sidle
and
at
last
the
cause
was
disclosed
from
the
chair
beneath
her
she
extracted
a
on
which
were
powdered
in
turquoise
the
initials
e
that
belongs
to
said
the
clergyman
a
good
fellow
lavish
but
i
wish
she
d
start
a
oh
beebe
said
miss
alan
divided
between
awe
and
mirth
indeed
though
it
is
dreadful
for
her
to
smoke
it
is
not
quite
as
dreadful
as
you
suppose
she
took
to
it
practically
in
despair
after
her
life
s
work
was
carried
away
in
a
landslip
surely
that
makes
it
more
what
was
that
asked
lucy
beebe
sat
back
complacently
and
miss
alan
began
as
follows
it
was
a
novel
and
i
am
afraid
from
what
i
can
gather
not
a
very
nice
novel
it
is
so
sad
when
people
who
have
abilities
misuse
them
and
i
must
say
they
nearly
always
do
anyhow
she
left
it
almost
finished
in
the
grotto
of
the
calvary
at
the
capuccini
hotel
at
amalfi
while
she
went
for
a
little
ink
she
said
can
i
have
a
little
ink
please
but
you
know
what
italians
are
and
meanwhile
the
grotto
fell
roaring
on
to
the
beach
and
the
saddest
thing
of
all
is
that
she
can
not
remember
what
she
has
written
the
poor
thing
was
very
ill
after
it
and
so
got
tempted
into
cigarettes
it
is
a
great
secret
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
she
is
writing
another
novel
she
told
teresa
and
miss
pole
the
other
day
that
she
had
got
up
all
the
local
colour
this
novel
is
to
be
about
modern
italy
the
other
was
historical
but
that
she
could
not
start
till
she
had
an
idea
first
she
tried
perugia
for
an
inspiration
then
she
came
here
this
must
on
no
account
get
round
and
so
cheerful
through
it
all
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
is
something
to
admire
in
everyone
even
if
you
do
not
approve
of
miss
alan
was
always
thus
being
charitable
against
her
better
judgement
a
delicate
pathos
perfumed
her
disconnected
remarks
giving
them
unexpected
beauty
just
as
in
the
decaying
autumn
woods
there
sometimes
rise
odours
reminiscent
of
spring
she
felt
she
had
made
almost
too
many
allowances
and
apologized
hurriedly
for
her
toleration
all
the
same
she
is
a
little
too
i
hardly
like
to
say
unwomanly
but
she
behaved
most
strangely
when
the
emersons
beebe
smiled
as
miss
alan
plunged
into
an
anecdote
which
he
knew
she
would
be
unable
to
finish
in
the
presence
of
a
gentleman
i
don
t
know
miss
honeychurch
if
you
have
noticed
that
miss
pole
the
lady
who
has
so
much
yellow
hair
takes
lemonade
that
old
emerson
who
puts
things
very
strangely
her
jaw
dropped
she
was
silent
beebe
whose
social
resources
were
endless
went
out
to
order
some
tea
and
she
continued
to
lucy
in
a
hasty
whisper
stomach
he
warned
miss
pole
of
her
he
called
it
and
he
may
have
meant
to
be
kind
i
must
say
i
forgot
myself
and
laughed
it
was
so
sudden
as
teresa
truly
said
it
was
no
laughing
matter
but
the
point
is
that
miss
lavish
was
positively
attracted
by
his
mentioning
and
said
she
liked
plain
speaking
and
meeting
different
grades
of
thought
she
thought
they
were
commercial
travellers
drummers
was
the
word
she
used
and
all
through
dinner
she
tried
to
prove
that
england
our
great
and
beloved
country
rests
on
nothing
but
commerce
teresa
was
very
much
annoyed
and
left
the
table
before
the
cheese
saying
as
she
did
so
there
miss
lavish
is
one
who
can
confute
you
better
than
i
and
pointed
to
that
beautiful
picture
of
lord
tennyson
then
miss
lavish
said
tut
the
early
just
imagine
tut
the
early
my
sister
had
gone
and
i
felt
bound
to
speak
i
said
miss
lavish
i
am
an
early
victorian
at
least
that
is
to
say
i
will
hear
no
breath
of
censure
against
our
dear
it
was
horrible
speaking
i
reminded
her
how
the
queen
had
been
to
ireland
when
she
did
not
want
to
go
and
i
must
say
she
was
dumbfounded
and
made
no
reply
but
unluckily
emerson
overheard
this
part
and
called
in
his
deep
voice
quite
so
quite
so
i
honour
the
woman
for
her
irish
the
woman
i
tell
things
so
badly
but
you
see
what
a
tangle
we
were
in
by
this
time
all
on
account
of
having
been
mentioned
in
the
first
place
but
that
was
not
all
after
dinner
miss
lavish
actually
came
up
and
said
miss
alan
i
am
going
into
the
to
talk
to
those
two
nice
men
come
needless
to
say
i
refused
such
an
unsuitable
invitation
and
she
had
the
impertinence
to
tell
me
that
it
would
broaden
my
ideas
and
said
that
she
had
four
brothers
all
university
men
except
one
who
was
in
the
army
who
always
made
a
point
of
talking
to
commercial
let
me
finish
the
story
said
beebe
who
had
returned
miss
lavish
tried
miss
pole
myself
everyone
and
finally
said
i
shall
go
she
went
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
she
returned
unobtrusively
with
a
green
baize
board
and
began
playing
whatever
happened
cried
lucy
no
one
knows
no
one
will
ever
know
miss
lavish
will
never
dare
to
tell
and
emerson
does
not
think
it
worth
mr
beebe
old
emerson
is
he
nice
or
not
nice
i
do
so
want
to
beebe
laughed
and
suggested
that
she
should
settle
the
question
for
herself
no
but
it
is
so
difficult
sometimes
he
is
so
silly
and
then
i
do
not
mind
him
miss
alan
what
do
you
think
is
he
nice
the
little
old
lady
shook
her
head
and
sighed
disapprovingly
beebe
whom
the
conversation
amused
stirred
her
up
by
saying
i
consider
that
you
are
bound
to
class
him
as
nice
miss
alan
after
that
business
of
the
violets
oh
dear
who
told
you
about
the
violets
how
do
things
get
round
a
pension
is
a
bad
place
for
gossips
no
i
can
not
forget
how
they
behaved
at
eager
s
lecture
at
santa
croce
oh
poor
miss
honeychurch
it
really
was
too
bad
no
i
have
quite
changed
i
do
not
like
the
emersons
they
are
not
beebe
smiled
nonchalantly
he
had
made
a
gentle
effort
to
introduce
the
emersons
into
bertolini
society
and
the
effort
had
failed
he
was
almost
the
only
person
who
remained
friendly
to
them
miss
lavish
who
represented
intellect
was
avowedly
hostile
and
now
the
miss
alans
who
stood
for
good
breeding
were
following
her
miss
bartlett
smarting
under
an
obligation
would
scarcely
be
civil
the
case
of
lucy
was
different
she
had
given
him
a
hazy
account
of
her
adventures
in
santa
croce
and
he
gathered
that
the
two
men
had
made
a
curious
and
possibly
concerted
attempt
to
annex
her
to
show
her
the
world
from
their
own
strange
standpoint
to
interest
her
in
their
private
sorrows
and
joys
this
was
impertinent
he
did
not
wish
their
cause
to
be
championed
by
a
young
girl
he
would
rather
it
should
fail
after
all
he
knew
nothing
about
them
and
pension
joys
pension
sorrows
are
flimsy
things
whereas
lucy
would
be
his
parishioner
lucy
with
one
eye
upon
the
weather
finally
said
that
she
thought
the
emersons
were
nice
not
that
she
saw
anything
of
them
now
even
their
seats
at
dinner
had
been
moved
but
aren
t
they
always
waylaying
you
to
go
out
with
them
dear
said
the
little
lady
inquisitively
only
once
charlotte
didn
t
like
it
and
said
something
quite
politely
of
most
right
of
her
they
don
t
understand
our
ways
they
must
find
their
beebe
rather
felt
that
they
had
gone
under
they
had
given
up
their
attempt
if
it
was
one
to
conquer
society
and
now
the
father
was
almost
as
silent
as
the
son
he
wondered
whether
he
would
not
plan
a
pleasant
day
for
these
folk
before
they
left
some
expedition
perhaps
with
lucy
well
chaperoned
to
be
nice
to
them
it
was
one
of
beebe
s
chief
pleasures
to
provide
people
with
happy
memories
evening
approached
while
they
chatted
the
air
became
brighter
the
colours
on
the
trees
and
hills
were
purified
and
the
arno
lost
its
muddy
solidity
and
began
to
twinkle
there
were
a
few
streaks
of
among
the
clouds
a
few
patches
of
watery
light
upon
the
earth
and
then
the
dripping
facade
of
san
miniato
shone
brilliantly
in
the
declining
sun
too
late
to
go
out
said
miss
alan
in
a
voice
of
relief
all
the
galleries
are
i
think
i
shall
go
out
said
lucy
i
want
to
go
round
the
town
in
the
circular
tram
on
the
platform
by
the
her
two
companions
looked
grave
beebe
who
felt
responsible
for
her
in
the
absence
of
miss
bartlett
ventured
to
say
i
wish
we
could
unluckily
i
have
letters
if
you
do
want
to
go
out
alone
won
t
you
be
better
on
your
feet
italians
dear
you
know
said
miss
alan
perhaps
i
shall
meet
someone
who
reads
me
through
and
through
but
they
still
looked
disapproval
and
she
so
far
conceded
to
beebe
as
to
say
that
she
would
only
go
for
a
little
walk
and
keep
to
the
street
frequented
by
tourists
she
oughtn
t
really
to
go
at
all
said
beebe
as
they
watched
her
from
the
window
and
she
knows
it
i
put
it
down
to
too
much
chapter
iv
fourth
chapter
beebe
was
right
lucy
never
knew
her
desires
so
clearly
as
after
music
she
had
not
really
appreciated
the
clergyman
s
wit
nor
the
suggestive
twitterings
of
miss
alan
conversation
was
tedious
she
wanted
something
big
and
she
believed
that
it
would
have
come
to
her
on
the
platform
of
an
electric
tram
this
she
might
not
attempt
it
was
unladylike
why
why
were
most
big
things
unladylike
charlotte
had
once
explained
to
her
why
it
was
not
that
ladies
were
inferior
to
men
it
was
that
they
were
different
their
mission
was
to
inspire
others
to
achievement
rather
than
to
achieve
themselves
indirectly
by
means
of
tact
and
a
spotless
name
a
lady
could
accomplish
much
but
if
she
rushed
into
the
fray
herself
she
would
be
first
censured
then
despised
and
finally
ignored
poems
had
been
written
to
illustrate
this
point
there
is
much
that
is
immortal
in
this
medieval
lady
the
dragons
have
gone
and
so
have
the
knights
but
still
she
lingers
in
our
midst
she
reigned
in
many
an
early
victorian
castle
and
was
queen
of
much
early
victorian
song
it
is
sweet
to
protect
her
in
the
intervals
of
business
sweet
to
pay
her
honour
when
she
has
cooked
our
dinner
well
but
alas
the
creature
grows
degenerate
in
her
heart
also
there
are
springing
up
strange
desires
she
too
is
enamoured
of
heavy
winds
and
vast
panoramas
and
green
expanses
of
the
sea
she
has
marked
the
kingdom
of
this
world
how
full
it
is
of
wealth
and
beauty
and
war
a
radiant
crust
built
around
the
central
fires
spinning
towards
the
receding
heavens
men
declaring
that
she
inspires
them
to
it
move
joyfully
over
the
surface
having
the
most
delightful
meetings
with
other
men
happy
not
because
they
are
masculine
but
because
they
are
alive
before
the
show
breaks
up
she
would
like
to
drop
the
august
title
of
the
eternal
woman
and
go
there
as
her
transitory
self
lucy
does
not
stand
for
the
medieval
lady
who
was
rather
an
ideal
to
which
she
was
bidden
to
lift
her
eyes
when
feeling
serious
nor
has
she
any
system
of
revolt
here
and
there
a
restriction
annoyed
her
particularly
and
she
would
transgress
it
and
perhaps
be
sorry
that
she
had
done
so
this
afternoon
she
was
peculiarly
restive
she
would
really
like
to
do
something
of
which
her
disapproved
as
she
might
not
go
on
the
electric
tram
she
went
to
alinari
s
shop
there
she
bought
a
photograph
of
botticelli
s
birth
of
venus
being
a
pity
spoilt
the
picture
otherwise
so
charming
and
miss
bartlett
had
persuaded
her
to
do
without
it
a
pity
in
art
of
course
signified
the
nude
giorgione
s
tempesta
the
idolino
some
of
the
sistine
frescoes
and
the
apoxyomenos
were
added
to
it
she
felt
a
little
calmer
then
and
bought
fra
angelico
s
coronation
giotto
s
ascension
of
john
some
della
robbia
babies
and
some
guido
reni
madonnas
for
her
taste
was
catholic
and
she
extended
uncritical
approval
to
every
name
but
though
she
spent
nearly
seven
lire
the
gates
of
liberty
seemed
still
unopened
she
was
conscious
of
her
discontent
it
was
new
to
her
to
be
conscious
of
it
the
world
she
thought
is
certainly
full
of
beautiful
things
if
only
i
could
come
across
it
was
not
surprising
that
honeychurch
disapproved
of
music
declaring
that
it
always
left
her
daughter
peevish
unpractical
and
touchy
nothing
ever
happens
to
me
she
reflected
as
she
entered
the
piazza
signoria
and
looked
nonchalantly
at
its
marvels
now
fairly
familiar
to
her
the
great
square
was
in
shadow
the
sunshine
had
come
too
late
to
strike
it
neptune
was
already
unsubstantial
in
the
twilight
half
god
half
ghost
and
his
fountain
plashed
dreamily
to
the
men
and
satyrs
who
idled
together
on
its
marge
the
loggia
showed
as
the
triple
entrance
of
a
cave
wherein
many
a
deity
shadowy
but
immortal
looking
forth
upon
the
arrivals
and
departures
of
mankind
it
was
the
hour
of
unreality
the
hour
that
is
when
unfamiliar
things
are
real
an
older
person
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
place
might
think
that
sufficient
was
happening
to
him
and
rest
content
lucy
desired
more
she
fixed
her
eyes
wistfully
on
the
tower
of
the
palace
which
rose
out
of
the
lower
darkness
like
a
pillar
of
roughened
gold
it
seemed
no
longer
a
tower
no
longer
supported
by
earth
but
some
unattainable
treasure
throbbing
in
the
tranquil
sky
its
brightness
mesmerized
her
still
dancing
before
her
eyes
when
she
bent
them
to
the
ground
and
started
towards
home
then
something
did
happen
two
italians
by
the
loggia
had
been
bickering
about
a
debt
cinque
lire
they
had
cried
cinque
lire
they
sparred
at
each
other
and
one
of
them
was
hit
lightly
upon
the
chest
he
frowned
he
bent
towards
lucy
with
a
look
of
interest
as
if
he
had
an
important
message
for
her
he
opened
his
lips
to
deliver
it
and
a
stream
of
red
came
out
between
them
and
trickled
down
his
unshaven
chin
that
was
all
a
crowd
rose
out
of
the
dusk
it
hid
this
extraordinary
man
from
her
and
bore
him
away
to
the
fountain
george
emerson
happened
to
be
a
few
paces
away
looking
at
her
across
the
spot
where
the
man
had
been
how
very
odd
across
something
even
as
she
caught
sight
of
him
he
grew
dim
the
palace
itself
grew
dim
swayed
above
her
fell
on
to
her
softly
slowly
noiselessly
and
the
sky
fell
with
it
she
thought
oh
what
have
i
done
oh
what
have
i
done
she
murmured
and
opened
her
eyes
george
emerson
still
looked
at
her
but
not
across
anything
she
had
complained
of
dullness
and
lo
one
man
was
stabbed
and
another
held
her
in
his
arms
they
were
sitting
on
some
steps
in
the
uffizi
arcade
he
must
have
carried
her
he
rose
when
she
spoke
and
began
to
dust
his
knees
she
repeated
oh
what
have
i
done
you
i
i
am
very
how
are
you
now
perfectly
well
absolutely
and
she
began
to
nod
and
smile
then
let
us
come
home
there
s
no
point
in
our
he
held
out
his
hand
to
pull
her
up
she
pretended
not
to
see
it
the
cries
from
the
fountain
they
had
never
ceased
rang
emptily
the
whole
world
seemed
pale
and
void
of
its
original
meaning
how
very
kind
you
have
been
i
might
have
hurt
myself
falling
but
now
i
am
well
i
can
go
alone
thank
his
hand
was
still
extended
oh
my
photographs
she
exclaimed
suddenly
what
photographs
i
bought
some
photographs
at
alinari
s
i
must
have
dropped
them
out
there
in
the
she
looked
at
him
cautiously
would
you
add
to
your
kindness
by
fetching
them
he
added
to
his
kindness
as
soon
as
he
had
turned
his
back
lucy
arose
with
the
running
of
a
maniac
and
stole
down
the
arcade
towards
the
arno
miss
honeychurch
she
stopped
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
you
sit
still
you
aren
t
fit
to
go
home
yes
i
am
thank
you
so
very
no
you
aren
t
you
d
go
openly
if
you
but
i
had
rather
then
i
don
t
fetch
your
i
had
rather
be
he
said
imperiously
the
man
is
dead
the
man
is
probably
dead
sit
down
till
you
are
she
was
bewildered
and
obeyed
him
and
don
t
move
till
i
come
in
the
distance
she
saw
creatures
with
black
hoods
such
as
appear
in
dreams
the
palace
tower
had
lost
the
reflection
of
the
declining
day
and
joined
itself
to
earth
how
should
she
talk
to
emerson
when
he
returned
from
the
shadowy
square
again
the
thought
occurred
to
her
oh
what
have
i
done
the
thought
that
she
as
well
as
the
dying
man
had
crossed
some
spiritual
boundary
he
returned
and
she
talked
of
the
murder
oddly
enough
it
was
an
easy
topic
she
spoke
of
the
italian
character
she
became
almost
garrulous
over
the
incident
that
had
made
her
faint
five
minutes
before
being
strong
physically
she
soon
overcame
the
horror
of
blood
she
rose
without
his
assistance
and
though
wings
seemed
to
flutter
inside
her
she
walked
firmly
enough
towards
the
arno
there
a
cabman
signalled
to
them
they
refused
him
and
the
murderer
tried
to
kiss
him
you
say
how
very
odd
italians
are
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
police
beebe
was
saying
that
italians
know
everything
but
i
think
they
are
rather
childish
when
my
cousin
and
i
were
at
the
pitti
yesterday
what
was
that
he
had
thrown
something
into
the
stream
what
did
you
throw
in
things
i
didn
t
want
he
said
crossly
mr
emerson
well
where
are
the
photographs
he
was
silent
i
believe
it
was
my
photographs
that
you
threw
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
them
he
cried
and
his
voice
was
that
of
an
anxious
boy
her
heart
warmed
towards
him
for
the
first
time
they
were
covered
with
blood
there
i
m
glad
i
ve
told
you
and
all
the
time
we
were
making
conversation
i
was
wondering
what
to
do
with
he
pointed
they
ve
the
river
swirled
under
the
bridge
i
did
mind
them
so
and
one
is
so
foolish
it
seemed
better
that
they
should
go
out
to
the
sea
i
don
t
know
i
may
just
mean
that
they
frightened
then
the
boy
verged
into
a
man
for
something
tremendous
has
happened
i
must
face
it
without
getting
muddled
it
isn
t
exactly
that
a
man
has
something
warned
lucy
that
she
must
stop
him
it
has
happened
he
repeated
and
i
mean
to
find
out
what
it
mr
emerson
he
turned
towards
her
frowning
as
if
she
had
disturbed
him
in
some
abstract
quest
i
want
to
ask
you
something
before
we
go
they
were
close
to
their
pension
she
stopped
and
leant
her
elbows
against
the
parapet
of
the
embankment
he
did
likewise
there
is
at
times
a
magic
in
identity
of
position
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
have
suggested
to
us
eternal
comradeship
she
moved
her
elbows
before
saying
i
have
behaved
he
was
following
his
own
thoughts
i
was
never
so
much
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
i
can
not
think
what
came
over
i
nearly
fainted
myself
he
said
but
she
felt
that
her
attitude
repelled
him
well
i
owe
you
a
thousand
oh
all
and
this
is
the
real
point
you
know
how
silly
people
are
gossiping
ladies
especially
i
am
afraid
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
m
afraid
i
don
i
mean
would
you
not
mention
it
to
any
one
my
foolish
behaviour
your
behaviour
oh
yes
all
right
all
thank
you
so
much
and
would
you
she
could
not
carry
her
request
any
further
the
river
was
rushing
below
them
almost
black
in
the
advancing
night
he
had
thrown
her
photographs
into
it
and
then
he
had
told
her
the
reason
it
struck
her
that
it
was
hopeless
to
look
for
chivalry
in
such
a
man
he
would
do
her
no
harm
by
idle
gossip
he
was
trustworthy
intelligent
and
even
kind
he
might
even
have
a
high
opinion
of
her
but
he
lacked
chivalry
his
thoughts
like
his
behaviour
would
not
be
modified
by
awe
it
was
useless
to
say
to
him
and
would
you
and
hope
that
he
would
complete
the
sentence
for
himself
averting
his
eyes
from
her
nakedness
like
the
knight
in
that
beautiful
picture
she
had
been
in
his
arms
and
he
remembered
it
just
as
he
remembered
the
blood
on
the
photographs
that
she
had
bought
in
alinari
s
shop
it
was
not
exactly
that
a
man
had
died
something
had
happened
to
the
living
they
had
come
to
a
situation
where
character
tells
and
where
childhood
enters
upon
the
branching
paths
of
youth
well
thank
you
so
much
she
repeated
how
quickly
these
accidents
do
happen
and
then
one
returns
to
the
old
life
i
don
anxiety
moved
her
to
question
him
his
answer
was
puzzling
i
shall
probably
want
to
but
why
emerson
what
do
you
mean
i
shall
want
to
live
i
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
parapet
she
contemplated
the
river
arno
whose
roar
was
suggesting
some
unexpected
melody
to
her
ears
chapter
v
possibilities
of
a
pleasant
outing
it
was
a
family
saying
that
you
never
knew
which
way
charlotte
bartlett
would
she
was
perfectly
pleasant
and
sensible
over
lucy
s
adventure
found
the
abridged
account
of
it
quite
adequate
and
paid
suitable
tribute
to
the
courtesy
of
george
emerson
she
and
miss
lavish
had
had
an
adventure
also
they
had
been
stopped
at
the
dazio
coming
back
and
the
young
officials
there
who
seemed
impudent
and
desoeuvre
had
tried
to
search
their
reticules
for
provisions
it
might
have
been
most
unpleasant
fortunately
miss
lavish
was
a
match
for
any
one
for
good
or
for
evil
lucy
was
left
to
face
her
problem
alone
none
of
her
friends
had
seen
her
either
in
the
piazza
or
later
on
by
the
embankment
beebe
indeed
noticing
her
startled
eyes
at
had
again
passed
to
himself
the
remark
of
too
much
but
he
only
supposed
that
she
was
ready
for
an
adventure
not
that
she
had
encountered
it
this
solitude
oppressed
her
she
was
accustomed
to
have
her
thoughts
confirmed
by
others
or
at
all
events
contradicted
it
was
too
dreadful
not
to
know
whether
she
was
thinking
right
or
wrong
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
took
decisive
action
there
were
two
plans
between
which
she
had
to
choose
beebe
was
walking
up
to
the
torre
del
gallo
with
the
emersons
and
some
american
ladies
would
miss
bartlett
and
miss
honeychurch
join
the
party
charlotte
declined
for
herself
she
had
been
there
in
the
rain
the
previous
afternoon
but
she
thought
it
an
admirable
idea
for
lucy
who
hated
shopping
changing
money
fetching
letters
and
other
irksome
duties
all
of
which
miss
bartlett
must
accomplish
this
morning
and
could
easily
accomplish
alone
no
charlotte
cried
the
girl
with
real
warmth
it
s
very
kind
of
beebe
but
i
am
certainly
coming
with
you
i
had
much
very
well
dear
said
miss
bartlett
with
a
faint
flush
of
pleasure
that
called
forth
a
deep
flush
of
shame
on
the
cheeks
of
lucy
how
abominably
she
behaved
to
charlotte
now
as
always
but
now
she
should
alter
all
morning
she
would
be
really
nice
to
her
she
slipped
her
arm
into
her
cousin
s
and
they
started
off
along
the
lung
arno
the
river
was
a
lion
that
morning
in
strength
voice
and
colour
miss
bartlett
insisted
on
leaning
over
the
parapet
to
look
at
it
she
then
made
her
usual
remark
which
was
how
i
do
wish
freddy
and
your
mother
could
see
this
too
lucy
fidgeted
it
was
tiresome
of
charlotte
to
have
stopped
exactly
where
she
did
look
lucia
oh
you
are
watching
for
the
torre
del
gallo
party
i
feared
you
would
repent
you
of
your
serious
as
the
choice
had
been
lucy
did
not
repent
yesterday
had
been
a
muddle
queer
and
odd
the
kind
of
thing
one
could
not
write
down
easily
on
paper
but
she
had
a
feeling
that
charlotte
and
her
shopping
were
preferable
to
george
emerson
and
the
summit
of
the
torre
del
gallo
since
she
could
not
unravel
the
tangle
she
must
take
care
not
to
it
she
could
protest
sincerely
against
miss
bartlett
s
insinuations
but
though
she
had
avoided
the
chief
actor
the
scenery
unfortunately
remained
charlotte
with
the
complacency
of
fate
led
her
from
the
river
to
the
piazza
signoria
she
could
not
have
believed
that
stones
a
loggia
a
fountain
a
palace
tower
would
have
such
significance
for
a
moment
she
understood
the
nature
of
ghosts
the
exact
site
of
the
murder
was
occupied
not
by
a
ghost
but
by
miss
lavish
who
had
the
morning
newspaper
in
her
hand
she
hailed
them
briskly
the
dreadful
catastrophe
of
the
previous
day
had
given
her
an
idea
which
she
thought
would
work
up
into
a
book
oh
let
me
congratulate
you
said
miss
bartlett
after
your
despair
of
yesterday
what
a
fortunate
thing
aha
miss
honeychurch
come
you
here
i
am
in
luck
now
you
are
to
tell
me
absolutely
everything
that
you
saw
from
the
lucy
poked
at
the
ground
with
her
parasol
but
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
i
m
sorry
if
you
could
manage
without
it
i
think
i
would
rather
the
elder
ladies
exchanged
glances
not
of
disapproval
it
is
suitable
that
a
girl
should
feel
deeply
it
is
i
who
am
sorry
said
miss
lavish
literary
hacks
are
shameless
creatures
i
believe
there
s
no
secret
of
the
human
heart
into
which
we
wouldn
t
she
marched
cheerfully
to
the
fountain
and
back
and
did
a
few
calculations
in
realism
then
she
said
that
she
had
been
in
the
piazza
since
eight
o
clock
collecting
material
a
good
deal
of
it
was
unsuitable
but
of
course
one
always
had
to
adapt
the
two
men
had
quarrelled
over
a
note
for
the
note
she
should
substitute
a
young
lady
which
would
raise
the
tone
of
the
tragedy
and
at
the
same
time
furnish
an
excellent
plot
what
is
the
heroine
s
name
asked
miss
bartlett
leonora
said
miss
lavish
her
own
name
was
eleanor
i
do
hope
she
s
that
desideratum
would
not
be
omitted
and
what
is
the
plot
love
murder
abduction
revenge
was
the
plot
but
it
all
came
while
the
fountain
plashed
to
the
satyrs
in
the
morning
sun
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
for
boring
on
like
this
miss
lavish
concluded
it
is
so
tempting
to
talk
to
really
sympathetic
people
of
course
this
is
the
barest
outline
there
will
be
a
deal
of
local
colouring
descriptions
of
florence
and
the
neighbourhood
and
i
shall
also
introduce
some
humorous
characters
and
let
me
give
you
all
fair
warning
i
intend
to
be
unmerciful
to
the
british
oh
you
wicked
woman
cried
miss
bartlett
i
am
sure
you
are
thinking
of
the
miss
lavish
gave
a
machiavellian
smile
i
confess
that
in
italy
my
sympathies
are
not
with
my
own
countrymen
it
is
the
neglected
italians
who
attract
me
and
whose
lives
i
am
going
to
paint
so
far
as
i
can
for
i
repeat
and
i
insist
and
i
have
always
held
most
strongly
that
a
tragedy
such
as
yesterday
s
is
not
the
less
tragic
because
it
happened
in
humble
there
was
a
fitting
silence
when
miss
lavish
had
concluded
then
the
cousins
wished
success
to
her
labours
and
walked
slowly
away
across
the
square
she
is
my
idea
of
a
really
clever
woman
said
miss
bartlett
that
last
remark
struck
me
as
so
particularly
true
it
should
be
a
most
pathetic
lucy
assented
at
present
her
great
aim
was
not
to
get
put
into
it
her
perceptions
this
morning
were
curiously
keen
and
she
believed
that
miss
lavish
had
her
on
trial
for
an
ingenue
she
is
emancipated
but
only
in
the
very
best
sense
of
the
word
continued
miss
bartlett
slowly
none
but
the
superficial
would
be
shocked
at
her
we
had
a
long
talk
yesterday
she
believes
in
justice
and
truth
and
human
interest
she
told
me
also
that
she
has
a
high
opinion
of
the
destiny
of
woman
mr
eager
why
how
nice
what
a
pleasant
surprise
ah
not
for
me
said
the
chaplain
blandly
for
i
have
been
watching
you
and
miss
honeychurch
for
quite
a
little
we
were
chatting
to
miss
his
brow
contracted
so
i
saw
were
you
indeed
andate
via
sono
occupato
the
last
remark
was
made
to
a
vender
of
panoramic
photographs
who
was
approaching
with
a
courteous
smile
i
am
about
to
venture
a
suggestion
would
you
and
miss
honeychurch
be
disposed
to
join
me
in
a
drive
some
day
this
week
a
drive
in
the
hills
we
might
go
up
by
fiesole
and
back
by
settignano
there
is
a
point
on
that
road
where
we
could
get
down
and
have
an
hour
s
ramble
on
the
hillside
the
view
thence
of
florence
is
most
beautiful
far
better
than
the
hackneyed
view
of
fiesole
it
is
the
view
that
alessio
baldovinetti
is
fond
of
introducing
into
his
pictures
that
man
had
a
decided
feeling
for
landscape
decidedly
but
who
looks
at
it
ah
the
world
is
too
much
for
miss
bartlett
had
not
heard
of
alessio
baldovinetti
but
she
knew
that
mr
eager
was
no
commonplace
chaplain
he
was
a
member
of
the
residential
colony
who
had
made
florence
their
home
he
knew
the
people
who
never
walked
about
with
baedekers
who
had
learnt
to
take
a
siesta
after
lunch
who
took
drives
the
pension
tourists
had
never
heard
of
and
saw
by
private
influence
galleries
which
were
closed
to
them
living
in
delicate
seclusion
some
in
furnished
flats
others
in
renaissance
villas
on
fiesole
s
slope
they
read
wrote
studied
and
exchanged
ideas
thus
attaining
to
that
intimate
knowledge
or
rather
perception
of
florence
which
is
denied
to
all
who
carry
in
their
pockets
the
coupons
of
cook
therefore
an
invitation
from
the
chaplain
was
something
to
be
proud
of
between
the
two
sections
of
his
flock
he
was
often
the
only
link
and
it
was
his
avowed
custom
to
select
those
of
his
migratory
sheep
who
seemed
worthy
and
give
them
a
few
hours
in
the
pastures
of
the
permanent
tea
at
a
renaissance
villa
nothing
had
been
said
about
it
yet
but
if
it
did
come
to
that
how
lucy
would
enjoy
it
a
few
days
ago
and
lucy
would
have
felt
the
same
but
the
joys
of
life
were
grouping
themselves
anew
a
drive
in
the
hills
with
mr
eager
and
miss
bartlett
even
if
culminating
in
a
residential
was
no
longer
the
greatest
of
them
she
echoed
the
raptures
of
charlotte
somewhat
faintly
only
when
she
heard
that
beebe
was
also
coming
did
her
thanks
become
more
sincere
so
we
shall
be
a
partie
carree
said
the
chaplain
in
these
days
of
toil
and
tumult
one
has
great
needs
of
the
country
and
its
message
of
purity
andate
via
andate
presto
presto
ah
the
town
beautiful
as
it
is
it
is
the
they
assented
this
very
square
so
i
am
told
witnessed
yesterday
the
most
sordid
of
tragedies
to
one
who
loves
the
florence
of
dante
and
savonarola
there
is
something
portentous
in
such
desecration
portentous
and
humiliating
indeed
said
miss
bartlett
miss
honeychurch
happened
to
be
passing
through
as
it
happened
she
can
hardly
bear
to
speak
of
she
glanced
at
lucy
proudly
and
how
came
we
to
have
you
here
asked
the
chaplain
paternally
miss
bartlett
s
recent
liberalism
oozed
away
at
the
question
do
not
blame
her
please
mr
eager
the
fault
is
mine
i
left
her
so
you
were
here
alone
miss
honeychurch
his
voice
suggested
sympathetic
reproof
but
at
the
same
time
indicated
that
a
few
harrowing
details
would
not
be
unacceptable
his
dark
handsome
face
drooped
mournfully
towards
her
to
catch
her
reply
one
of
our
pension
acquaintances
kindly
brought
her
home
said
miss
bartlett
adroitly
concealing
the
sex
of
the
preserver
for
her
also
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
experience
i
trust
that
neither
of
you
was
at
all
that
it
was
not
in
your
immediate
proximity
of
the
many
things
lucy
was
noticing
not
the
least
remarkable
was
this
the
ghoulish
fashion
in
which
respectable
people
will
nibble
after
blood
george
emerson
had
kept
the
subject
strangely
pure
he
died
by
the
fountain
i
believe
was
her
reply
and
you
and
your
friend
were
over
at
the
that
must
have
saved
you
much
you
have
not
of
course
seen
the
disgraceful
illustrations
which
the
gutter
press
this
man
is
a
public
nuisance
he
knows
that
i
am
a
resident
perfectly
well
and
yet
he
goes
on
worrying
me
to
buy
his
vulgar
surely
the
vendor
of
photographs
was
in
league
with
lucy
in
the
eternal
league
of
italy
with
youth
he
had
suddenly
extended
his
book
before
miss
bartlett
and
mr
eager
binding
their
hands
together
by
a
long
glossy
ribbon
of
churches
pictures
and
views
this
is
too
much
cried
the
chaplain
striking
petulantly
at
one
of
fra
angelico
s
angels
she
tore
a
shrill
cry
rose
from
the
vendor
the
book
it
seemed
was
more
valuable
than
one
would
have
supposed
willingly
would
i
purchase
began
miss
bartlett
ignore
him
said
mr
eager
sharply
and
they
all
walked
rapidly
away
from
the
square
but
an
italian
can
never
be
ignored
least
of
all
when
he
has
a
grievance
his
mysterious
persecution
of
mr
eager
became
relentless
the
air
rang
with
his
threats
and
lamentations
he
appealed
to
lucy
would
not
she
intercede
he
was
poor
he
sheltered
a
family
the
tax
on
bread
he
waited
he
gibbered
he
was
recompensed
he
was
dissatisfied
he
did
not
leave
them
until
he
had
swept
their
minds
clean
of
all
thoughts
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
shopping
was
the
topic
that
now
ensued
under
the
chaplain
s
guidance
they
selected
many
hideous
presents
and
mementoes
florid
little
that
seemed
fashioned
in
gilded
pastry
other
little
frames
more
severe
that
stood
on
little
easels
and
were
carven
out
of
oak
a
blotting
book
of
vellum
a
dante
of
the
same
material
cheap
mosaic
brooches
which
the
maids
next
christmas
would
never
tell
from
real
pins
pots
heraldic
saucers
brown
eros
and
psyche
in
alabaster
peter
to
match
all
of
which
would
have
cost
less
in
london
this
successful
morning
left
no
pleasant
impressions
on
lucy
she
had
been
a
little
frightened
both
by
miss
lavish
and
by
mr
eager
she
knew
not
why
and
as
they
frightened
her
she
had
strangely
enough
ceased
to
respect
them
she
doubted
that
miss
lavish
was
a
great
artist
she
doubted
that
mr
eager
was
as
full
of
spirituality
and
culture
as
she
had
been
led
to
suppose
they
were
tried
by
some
new
test
and
they
were
found
wanting
as
for
charlotte
as
for
charlotte
she
was
exactly
the
same
it
might
be
possible
to
be
nice
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
love
her
the
son
of
a
labourer
i
happen
to
know
it
for
a
fact
a
mechanic
of
some
sort
himself
when
he
was
young
then
he
took
to
writing
for
the
socialistic
press
i
came
across
him
at
they
were
talking
about
the
emersons
how
wonderfully
people
rise
in
these
days
sighed
miss
bartlett
fingering
a
model
of
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
generally
replied
mr
eager
one
has
only
sympathy
for
their
success
the
desire
for
education
and
for
social
advance
in
these
things
there
is
something
not
wholly
vile
there
are
some
working
men
whom
one
would
be
very
willing
to
see
out
here
in
florence
little
as
they
would
make
of
is
he
a
journalist
now
miss
bartlett
asked
he
is
not
he
made
an
advantageous
he
uttered
this
remark
with
a
voice
full
of
meaning
and
ended
with
a
sigh
oh
so
he
has
a
dead
miss
bartlett
dead
i
wonder
yes
i
wonder
how
he
has
the
effrontery
to
look
me
in
the
face
to
dare
to
claim
acquaintance
with
me
he
was
in
my
london
parish
long
ago
the
other
day
in
santa
croce
when
he
was
with
miss
honeychurch
i
snubbed
him
let
him
beware
that
he
does
not
get
more
than
a
what
cried
lucy
flushing
exposure
hissed
mr
eager
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
but
in
scoring
a
dramatic
point
he
had
interested
his
audience
more
than
he
had
intended
miss
bartlett
was
full
of
very
natural
curiosity
lucy
though
she
wished
never
to
see
the
emersons
again
was
not
disposed
to
condemn
them
on
a
single
word
do
you
mean
she
asked
that
he
is
an
irreligious
man
we
know
that
lucy
dear
said
miss
bartlett
gently
reproving
her
cousin
s
penetration
i
should
be
astonished
if
you
knew
all
the
boy
an
innocent
child
at
the
time
i
will
exclude
god
knows
what
his
education
and
his
inherited
qualities
may
have
made
perhaps
said
miss
bartlett
it
is
something
that
we
had
better
not
to
speak
plainly
said
mr
eager
it
is
i
will
say
no
for
the
first
time
lucy
s
rebellious
thoughts
swept
out
in
words
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
you
have
said
very
it
was
my
intention
to
say
very
little
was
his
frigid
reply
he
gazed
indignantly
at
the
girl
who
met
him
with
equal
indignation
she
turned
towards
him
from
the
shop
counter
her
breast
heaved
quickly
he
observed
her
brow
and
the
sudden
strength
of
her
lips
it
was
intolerable
that
she
should
disbelieve
him
murder
if
you
want
to
know
he
cried
angrily
that
man
murdered
his
wife
how
she
retorted
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
murdered
her
that
day
in
santa
croce
did
they
say
anything
against
me
not
a
word
mr
eager
not
a
single
oh
i
thought
they
had
been
libelling
me
to
you
but
i
suppose
it
is
only
their
personal
charms
that
makes
you
defend
i
m
not
defending
them
said
lucy
losing
her
courage
and
relapsing
into
the
old
chaotic
methods
they
re
nothing
to
how
could
you
think
she
was
defending
them
said
miss
bartlett
much
discomfited
by
the
unpleasant
scene
the
shopman
was
possibly
listening
she
will
find
it
difficult
for
that
man
has
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
the
addition
of
god
was
striking
but
the
chaplain
was
really
trying
to
qualify
a
rash
remark
a
silence
followed
which
might
have
been
impressive
but
was
merely
awkward
then
miss
bartlett
hastily
purchased
the
leaning
tower
and
led
the
way
into
the
street
i
must
be
going
said
he
shutting
his
eyes
and
taking
out
his
watch
miss
bartlett
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
the
approaching
drive
drive
oh
is
our
drive
to
come
off
lucy
was
recalled
to
her
manners
and
after
a
little
exertion
the
complacency
of
mr
eager
was
restored
bother
the
drive
exclaimed
the
girl
as
soon
as
he
had
departed
it
is
just
the
drive
we
had
arranged
with
beebe
without
any
fuss
at
all
why
should
he
invite
us
in
that
absurd
manner
we
might
as
well
invite
him
we
are
each
paying
for
miss
bartlett
who
had
intended
to
lament
over
the
emersons
was
launched
by
this
remark
into
unexpected
thoughts
if
that
is
so
dear
if
the
drive
we
and
beebe
are
going
with
mr
eager
is
really
the
same
as
the
one
we
are
going
with
beebe
then
i
foresee
a
sad
kettle
of
how
because
beebe
has
asked
eleanor
lavish
to
come
that
will
mean
another
far
worse
mr
eager
does
not
like
eleanor
she
knows
it
herself
the
truth
must
be
told
she
is
too
unconventional
for
they
were
now
in
the
at
the
english
bank
lucy
stood
by
the
central
table
heedless
of
punch
and
the
graphic
trying
to
answer
or
at
all
events
to
formulate
the
questions
rioting
in
her
brain
the
world
had
broken
up
and
there
emerged
florence
a
magic
city
where
people
thought
and
did
the
most
extraordinary
things
murder
accusations
of
murder
a
lady
clinging
to
one
man
and
being
rude
to
another
were
these
the
daily
incidents
of
her
streets
was
there
more
in
her
frank
beauty
than
met
the
eye
the
power
perhaps
to
evoke
passions
good
and
bad
and
to
bring
them
speedily
to
a
fulfillment
happy
charlotte
who
though
greatly
troubled
over
things
that
did
not
matter
seemed
oblivious
to
things
that
did
who
could
conjecture
with
admirable
delicacy
where
things
might
lead
to
but
apparently
lost
sight
of
the
goal
as
she
approached
it
now
she
was
crouching
in
the
corner
trying
to
extract
a
circular
note
from
a
kind
of
linen
which
hung
in
chaste
concealment
round
her
neck
she
had
been
told
that
this
was
the
only
safe
way
to
carry
money
in
italy
it
must
only
be
broached
within
the
walls
of
the
english
bank
as
she
groped
she
murmured
whether
it
is
beebe
who
forgot
to
tell
mr
eager
or
mr
eager
who
forgot
when
he
told
us
or
whether
they
have
decided
to
leave
eleanor
out
altogether
which
they
could
scarcely
do
but
in
any
case
we
must
be
prepared
it
is
you
they
really
want
i
am
only
asked
for
appearances
you
shall
go
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
i
and
eleanor
will
follow
behind
a
carriage
would
do
for
us
yet
how
difficult
it
is
it
is
indeed
replied
the
girl
with
a
gravity
that
sounded
sympathetic
what
do
you
think
about
it
asked
miss
bartlett
flushed
from
the
struggle
and
buttoning
up
her
dress
i
don
t
know
what
i
think
nor
what
i
oh
dear
lucy
i
do
hope
florence
isn
t
boring
you
speak
the
word
and
as
you
know
i
would
take
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
thank
you
charlotte
said
lucy
and
pondered
over
the
offer
there
were
letters
for
her
at
the
bureau
one
from
her
brother
full
of
athletics
and
biology
one
from
her
mother
delightful
as
only
her
mother
s
letters
could
be
she
had
read
in
it
of
the
crocuses
which
had
been
bought
for
yellow
and
were
coming
up
puce
of
the
new
who
had
watered
the
ferns
with
essence
of
lemonade
of
the
cottages
which
were
ruining
summer
street
and
breaking
the
heart
of
sir
harry
otway
she
recalled
the
free
pleasant
life
of
her
home
where
she
was
allowed
to
do
everything
and
where
nothing
ever
happened
to
her
the
road
up
through
the
the
clean
the
view
over
the
sussex
weald
all
hung
before
her
bright
and
distinct
but
pathetic
as
the
pictures
in
a
gallery
to
which
after
much
experience
a
traveller
returns
and
the
news
asked
miss
bartlett
mrs
vyse
and
her
son
have
gone
to
rome
said
lucy
giving
the
news
that
interested
her
least
do
you
know
the
vyses
oh
not
that
way
back
we
can
never
have
too
much
of
the
dear
piazza
they
re
nice
people
the
vyses
so
clever
my
idea
of
what
s
really
clever
don
t
you
long
to
be
in
rome
i
die
for
it
the
piazza
signoria
is
too
stony
to
be
brilliant
it
has
no
grass
no
flowers
no
frescoes
no
glittering
walls
of
marble
or
comforting
patches
of
ruddy
brick
by
an
odd
chance
unless
we
believe
in
a
presiding
genius
of
places
the
statues
that
relieve
its
severity
suggest
not
the
innocence
of
childhood
nor
the
glorious
bewilderment
of
youth
but
the
conscious
achievements
of
maturity
perseus
and
judith
hercules
and
thusnelda
they
have
done
or
suffered
something
and
though
they
are
immortal
immortality
has
come
to
them
after
experience
not
before
here
not
only
in
the
solitude
of
nature
might
a
hero
meet
a
goddess
or
a
heroine
a
god
charlotte
cried
the
girl
suddenly
here
s
an
idea
what
if
we
popped
off
to
rome
straight
to
the

hotel
for
i
do
know
what
i
want
i
m
sick
of

no
you
said
you
d
go
to
the
ends
of

do
do
miss
bartlett
with
equal
vivacity
replied
oh
you
droll
person
pray
what
would
become
of
your
drive
in
the
hills
they
passed
together
through
the
gaunt
beauty
of
the
square

over

them
it
was

who
drove
them
to

that
memorable
day
a
youth
all
irresponsibility
and
fire
recklessly
urging
his
master
s
horses
up
the
stony
hill
beebe
recognized
him
at
once
neither
the
ages
of
faith
nor
the
age
of
doubt
had
touched
him
he
was
phaethon
in
tuscany
driving
a
cab
and
it
was
persephone
whom
he
asked
leave
to
pick
up
on
the
way
saying
that
she
was
his
sister
persephone
tall
and
slender
and
pale
returning
with
the
spring
to
her
mother
s
cottage
and
still
shading
her
eyes
from
the
unaccustomed
light
to
her
mr
eager
objected
saying
that
here
was
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
and
one
must
guard
against
imposition
but
the
ladies
interceded
and
when
it
had
been
made
clear
that
it
was
a
very
great
favour
the
goddess
was
allowed
to
mount
beside
the
god
phaethon
at
once
slipped
the
left
rein
over
her
head
thus
enabling
himself
to
drive
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
did
not
mind
mr
eager
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
horses
saw
nothing
of
the
indecorous
proceeding
and
continued
his
conversation
with
lucy
the
other
two
occupants
of
the
carriage
were
old
emerson
and
miss
lavish
for
a
dreadful
thing
had
happened
beebe
without
consulting
mr
eager
had
doubled
the
size
of
the
party
and
though
miss
bartlett
and
miss
lavish
had
planned
all
the
morning
how
the
people
were
to
sit
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
carriages
came
round
they
lost
their
heads
and
miss
lavish
got
in
with
lucy
while
miss
bartlett
with
george
emerson
and
beebe
followed
on
behind
it
was
hard
on
the
poor
chaplain
to
have
his
partie
carree
thus
transformed
tea
at
a
renaissance
villa
if
he
had
ever
meditated
it
was
now
impossible
lucy
and
miss
bartlett
had
a
certain
style
about
them
and
beebe
though
unreliable
was
a
man
of
parts
but
a
shoddy
lady
writer
and
a
journalist
who
had
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
they
should
enter
no
villa
at
his
introduction
lucy
elegantly
dressed
in
white
sat
erect
and
nervous
amid
these
explosive
ingredients
attentive
to
mr
eager
repressive
towards
miss
lavish
watchful
of
old
emerson
hitherto
fortunately
asleep
thanks
to
a
heavy
lunch
and
the
drowsy
atmosphere
of
spring
she
looked
on
the
expedition
as
the
work
of
fate
but
for
it
she
would
have
avoided
george
emerson
successfully
in
an
open
manner
he
had
shown
that
he
wished
to
continue
their
intimacy
she
had
refused
not
because
she
disliked
him
but
because
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
and
suspected
that
he
did
know
and
this
frightened
her
for
the
real
event
whatever
it
was
had
taken
place
not
in
the
loggia
but
by
the
river
to
behave
wildly
at
the
sight
of
death
is
pardonable
but
to
discuss
it
afterwards
to
pass
from
discussion
into
silence
and
through
silence
into
sympathy
that
is
an
error
not
of
a
startled
emotion
but
of
the
whole
fabric
there
was
really
something
blameworthy
she
thought
in
their
joint
contemplation
of
the
shadowy
stream
in
the
common
impulse
which
had
turned
them
to
the
house
without
the
passing
of
a
look
or
word
this
sense
of
wickedness
had
been
slight
at
first
she
had
nearly
joined
the
party
to
the
torre
del
gallo
but
each
time
that
she
avoided
george
it
became
more
imperative
that
she
should
avoid
him
again
and
now
celestial
irony
working
through
her
cousin
and
two
clergymen
did
not
suffer
her
to
leave
florence
till
she
had
made
this
expedition
with
him
through
the
hills
meanwhile
mr
eager
held
her
in
civil
converse
their
little
tiff
was
over
so
miss
honeychurch
you
are
travelling
as
a
student
of
art
oh
dear
me
no
oh
no
perhaps
as
a
student
of
human
nature
interposed
miss
lavish
like
myself
oh
no
i
am
here
as
a
oh
indeed
said
mr
eager
are
you
indeed
if
you
will
not
think
me
rude
we
residents
sometimes
pity
you
poor
tourists
not
a
little
handed
about
like
a
parcel
of
goods
from
venice
to
florence
from
florence
to
rome
living
herded
together
in
pensions
or
hotels
quite
unconscious
of
anything
that
is
outside
baedeker
their
one
anxiety
to
get
done
or
through
and
go
on
somewhere
else
the
result
is
they
mix
up
towns
rivers
palaces
in
one
inextricable
whirl
you
know
the
american
girl
in
punch
who
says
say
poppa
what
did
we
see
at
rome
and
the
father
replies
why
guess
rome
was
the
place
where
we
saw
the
yaller
there
s
travelling
for
you
ha
ha
ha
i
quite
agree
said
miss
lavish
who
had
several
times
tried
to
interrupt
his
mordant
wit
the
narrowness
and
superficiality
of
the
tourist
is
nothing
less
than
a
quite
so
now
the
english
colony
at
florence
miss
honeychurch
and
it
is
of
considerable
size
though
of
course
not
all
equally
a
few
are
here
for
trade
for
example
but
the
greater
part
are
students
lady
helen
laverstock
is
at
present
busy
over
fra
angelico
i
mention
her
name
because
we
are
passing
her
villa
on
the
left
no
you
can
only
see
it
if
you
stand
no
do
not
stand
you
will
fall
she
is
very
proud
of
that
thick
hedge
inside
perfect
seclusion
one
might
have
gone
back
six
hundred
years
some
critics
believe
that
her
garden
was
the
scene
of
the
decameron
which
lends
it
an
additional
interest
does
it
not
it
does
indeed
cried
miss
lavish
tell
me
where
do
they
place
the
scene
of
that
wonderful
seventh
day
but
mr
eager
proceeded
to
tell
miss
honeychurch
that
on
the
right
lived
mr
someone
something
an
american
of
the
best
type
so
rare
and
that
the
somebody
elses
were
farther
down
the
hill
doubtless
you
know
her
monographs
in
the
series
of
mediaeval
byways
he
is
working
at
gemistus
pletho
sometimes
as
i
take
tea
in
their
beautiful
grounds
i
hear
over
the
wall
the
electric
tram
squealing
up
the
new
road
with
its
loads
of
hot
dusty
unintelligent
tourists
who
are
going
to
do
fiesole
in
an
hour
in
order
that
they
may
say
they
have
been
there
and
i
think
think
i
think
how
little
they
think
what
lies
so
near
during
this
speech
the
two
figures
on
the
box
were
sporting
with
each
other
disgracefully
lucy
had
a
spasm
of
envy
granted
that
they
wished
to
misbehave
it
was
pleasant
for
them
to
be
able
to
do
so
they
were
probably
the
only
people
enjoying
the
expedition
the
carriage
swept
with
agonizing
jolts
up
through
the
piazza
of
fiesole
and
into
the
settignano
road
piano
piano
said
mr
eager
elegantly
waving
his
hand
over
his
head
va
bene
signore
va
bene
va
bene
crooned
the
driver
and
whipped
his
horses
up
again
now
mr
eager
and
miss
lavish
began
to
talk
against
each
other
on
the
subject
of
alessio
baldovinetti
was
he
a
cause
of
the
renaissance
or
was
he
one
of
its
manifestations
the
other
carriage
was
left
behind
as
the
pace
increased
to
a
gallop
the
large
slumbering
form
of
emerson
was
thrown
against
the
chaplain
with
the
regularity
of
a
machine
piano
piano
said
he
with
a
martyred
look
at
lucy
an
extra
lurch
made
him
turn
angrily
in
his
seat
phaethon
who
for
some
time
had
been
endeavouring
to
kiss
persephone
had
just
succeeded
a
little
scene
ensued
which
as
miss
bartlett
said
afterwards
was
most
unpleasant
the
horses
were
stopped
the
lovers
were
ordered
to
disentangle
themselves
the
boy
was
to
lose
his
pourboire
the
girl
was
immediately
to
get
down
she
is
my
sister
said
he
turning
round
on
them
with
piteous
eyes
mr
eager
took
the
trouble
to
tell
him
that
he
was
a
liar
phaethon
hung
down
his
head
not
at
the
matter
of
the
accusation
but
at
its
manner
at
this
point
emerson
whom
the
shock
of
stopping
had
awoke
declared
that
the
lovers
must
on
no
account
be
separated
and
patted
them
on
the
back
to
signify
his
approval
and
miss
lavish
though
unwilling
to
ally
him
felt
bound
to
support
the
cause
of
bohemianism
most
certainly
i
would
let
them
be
she
cried
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
receive
scant
support
i
have
always
flown
in
the
face
of
the
conventions
all
my
life
this
is
what
i
call
an
we
must
not
submit
said
mr
eager
i
knew
he
was
trying
it
on
he
is
treating
us
as
if
we
were
a
party
of
cook
s
surely
no
said
miss
lavish
her
ardour
visibly
decreasing
the
other
carriage
had
drawn
up
behind
and
sensible
beebe
called
out
that
after
this
warning
the
couple
would
be
sure
to
behave
themselves
properly
leave
them
alone
emerson
begged
the
chaplain
of
whom
he
stood
in
no
awe
do
we
find
happiness
so
often
that
we
should
turn
it
off
the
box
when
it
happens
to
sit
there
to
be
driven
by
lovers
a
king
might
envy
us
and
if
we
part
them
it
s
more
like
sacrilege
than
anything
i
here
the
voice
of
miss
bartlett
was
heard
saying
that
a
crowd
had
begun
to
collect
mr
eager
who
suffered
from
an
tongue
rather
than
a
resolute
will
was
determined
to
make
himself
heard
he
addressed
the
driver
again
italian
in
the
mouth
of
italians
is
a
stream
with
unexpected
cataracts
and
boulders
to
preserve
it
from
monotony
in
eager
s
mouth
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
an
acid
whistling
fountain
which
played
ever
higher
and
higher
and
quicker
and
quicker
and
more
and
more
shrilly
till
abruptly
it
was
turned
off
with
a
click
signorina
said
the
man
to
lucy
when
the
display
had
ceased
why
should
he
appeal
to
lucy
signorina
echoed
persephone
in
her
glorious
contralto
she
pointed
at
the
other
carriage
why
for
a
moment
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
then
persephone
got
down
from
the
box
victory
at
last
said
mr
eager
smiting
his
hands
together
as
the
carriages
started
again
it
is
not
victory
said
emerson
it
is
defeat
you
have
parted
two
people
who
were
mr
eager
shut
his
eyes
he
was
obliged
to
sit
next
to
emerson
but
he
would
not
speak
to
him
the
old
man
was
refreshed
by
sleep
and
took
up
the
matter
warmly
he
commanded
lucy
to
agree
with
him
he
shouted
for
support
to
his
son
we
have
tried
to
buy
what
can
not
be
bought
with
money
he
has
bargained
to
drive
us
and
he
is
doing
it
we
have
no
rights
over
his
miss
lavish
frowned
it
is
hard
when
a
person
you
have
classed
as
typically
british
speaks
out
of
his
character
he
was
not
driving
us
well
she
said
he
jolted
that
i
deny
it
was
as
restful
as
sleeping
aha
he
is
jolting
us
now
can
you
wonder
he
would
like
to
throw
us
out
and
most
certainly
he
is
justified
and
if
i
were
superstitious
i
d
be
frightened
of
the
girl
too
it
doesn
t
do
to
injure
young
people
have
you
ever
heard
of
lorenzo
de
medici
miss
lavish
bristled
most
certainly
i
have
do
you
refer
to
lorenzo
il
magnifico
or
to
lorenzo
duke
of
urbino
or
to
lorenzo
surnamed
lorenzino
on
account
of
his
diminutive
stature
the
lord
knows
possibly
he
does
know
for
i
refer
to
lorenzo
the
poet
he
wrote
a
line
so
i
heard
yesterday
which
runs
like
this
don
t
go
fighting
against
the
mr
eager
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
for
erudition
non
fate
guerra
al
maggio
he
murmured
war
not
with
the
may
would
render
a
correct
the
point
is
we
have
warred
with
it
he
pointed
to
the
val
d
arno
which
was
visible
far
below
them
through
the
budding
trees
fifty
miles
of
spring
and
we
ve
come
up
to
admire
them
do
you
suppose
there
s
any
difference
between
spring
in
nature
and
spring
in
man
but
there
we
go
praising
the
one
and
condemning
the
other
as
improper
ashamed
that
the
same
laws
work
eternally
through
no
one
encouraged
him
to
talk
presently
mr
eager
gave
a
signal
for
the
carriages
to
stop
and
marshalled
the
party
for
their
ramble
on
the
hill
a
hollow
like
a
great
amphitheatre
full
of
terraced
steps
and
misty
olives
now
lay
between
them
and
the
heights
of
fiesole
and
the
road
still
following
its
curve
was
about
to
sweep
on
to
a
promontory
which
stood
out
in
the
plain
it
was
this
promontory
uncultivated
wet
covered
with
bushes
and
occasional
trees
which
had
caught
the
fancy
of
alessio
baldovinetti
nearly
five
hundred
years
before
he
had
ascended
it
that
diligent
and
rather
obscure
master
possibly
with
an
eye
to
business
possibly
for
the
joy
of
ascending
standing
there
he
had
seen
that
view
of
the
val
d
arno
and
distant
florence
which
he
afterwards
had
introduced
not
very
effectively
into
his
work
but
where
exactly
had
he
stood
that
was
the
question
which
mr
eager
hoped
to
solve
now
and
miss
lavish
whose
nature
was
attracted
by
anything
problematical
had
become
equally
enthusiastic
but
it
is
not
easy
to
carry
the
pictures
of
alessio
baldovinetti
in
your
head
even
if
you
have
remembered
to
look
at
them
before
starting
and
the
haze
in
the
valley
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
quest
the
party
sprang
about
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
grass
their
anxiety
to
keep
together
being
only
equalled
by
their
desire
to
go
different
directions
finally
they
split
into
groups
lucy
clung
to
miss
bartlett
and
miss
lavish
the
emersons
returned
to
hold
laborious
converse
with
the
drivers
while
the
two
clergymen
who
were
expected
to
have
topics
in
common
were
left
to
each
other
the
two
elder
ladies
soon
threw
off
the
mask
in
the
audible
whisper
that
was
now
so
familiar
to
lucy
they
began
to
discuss
not
alessio
baldovinetti
but
the
drive
miss
bartlett
had
asked
george
emerson
what
his
profession
was
and
he
had
answered
the
she
was
very
sorry
that
she
had
asked
him
she
had
no
idea
that
it
would
be
such
a
dreadful
answer
or
she
would
not
have
asked
him
beebe
had
turned
the
conversation
so
cleverly
and
she
hoped
that
the
young
man
was
not
very
much
hurt
at
her
asking
him
the
railway
gasped
miss
lavish
oh
but
i
shall
die
of
course
it
was
the
railway
she
could
not
control
her
mirth
he
is
the
image
of
a
porter
on
on
the
eleanor
be
quiet
plucking
at
her
vivacious
companion
hush
they
ll
hear
the
emersons
i
can
t
stop
let
me
go
my
wicked
way
a
porter
eleanor
i
m
sure
it
s
all
right
put
in
lucy
the
emersons
won
t
hear
and
they
wouldn
t
mind
if
they
miss
lavish
did
not
seem
pleased
at
this
miss
honeychurch
listening
she
said
rather
crossly
pouf
wouf
you
naughty
girl
go
away
oh
lucy
you
ought
to
be
with
mr
eager
i
m
i
can
t
find
them
now
and
i
don
t
want
to
mr
eager
will
be
offended
it
is
your
please
i
d
rather
stop
here
with
no
i
agree
said
miss
lavish
it
s
like
a
school
feast
the
boys
have
got
separated
from
the
girls
miss
lucy
you
are
to
go
we
wish
to
converse
on
high
topics
unsuited
for
your
the
girl
was
stubborn
as
her
time
at
florence
drew
to
its
close
she
was
only
at
ease
amongst
those
to
whom
she
felt
indifferent
such
a
one
was
miss
lavish
and
such
for
the
moment
was
charlotte
she
wished
she
had
not
called
attention
to
herself
they
were
both
annoyed
at
her
remark
and
seemed
determined
to
get
rid
of
her
how
tired
one
gets
said
miss
bartlett
oh
i
do
wish
freddy
and
your
mother
could
be
unselfishness
with
miss
bartlett
had
entirely
usurped
the
functions
of
enthusiasm
lucy
did
not
look
at
the
view
either
she
would
not
enjoy
anything
till
she
was
safe
at
rome
then
sit
you
down
said
miss
lavish
observe
my
with
many
a
smile
she
produced
two
of
those
mackintosh
squares
that
protect
the
frame
of
the
tourist
from
damp
grass
or
cold
marble
steps
she
sat
on
one
who
was
to
sit
on
the
other
lucy
without
a
moment
s
doubt
lucy
the
ground
will
do
for
me
really
i
have
not
had
rheumatism
for
years
if
i
do
feel
it
coming
on
i
shall
stand
imagine
your
mother
s
feelings
if
i
let
you
sit
in
the
wet
in
your
white
she
sat
down
heavily
where
the
ground
looked
particularly
moist
here
we
are
all
settled
delightfully
even
if
my
dress
is
thinner
it
will
not
show
so
much
being
brown
sit
down
dear
you
are
too
unselfish
you
don
t
assert
yourself
she
cleared
her
throat
now
don
t
be
alarmed
this
isn
t
a
cold
it
s
the
tiniest
cough
and
i
have
had
it
three
days
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
sitting
here
at
there
was
only
one
way
of
treating
the
situation
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
lucy
departed
in
search
of
beebe
and
mr
eager
vanquished
by
the
mackintosh
square
she
addressed
herself
to
the
drivers
who
were
sprawling
in
the
carriages
perfuming
the
cushions
with
cigars
the
miscreant
a
bony
young
man
scorched
black
by
the
sun
rose
to
greet
her
with
the
courtesy
of
a
host
and
the
assurance
of
a
relative
dove
said
lucy
after
much
anxious
thought
his
face
lit
up
of
course
he
knew
where
not
so
far
either
his
arm
swept
of
the
horizon
he
should
just
think
he
did
know
where
he
pressed
his
to
his
forehead
and
then
pushed
them
towards
her
as
if
oozing
with
visible
extract
of
knowledge
more
seemed
necessary
what
was
the
italian
for
clergyman
dove
buoni
uomini
said
she
at
last
good
scarcely
the
adjective
for
those
noble
beings
he
showed
her
his
cigar
uno
piu
piccolo
was
her
next
remark
implying
has
the
cigar
been
given
to
you
by
beebe
the
smaller
of
the
two
good
men
she
was
correct
as
usual
he
tied
the
horse
to
a
tree
kicked
it
to
make
it
stay
quiet
dusted
the
carriage
arranged
his
hair
remoulded
his
hat
encouraged
his
moustache
and
in
rather
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
minute
was
ready
to
conduct
her
italians
are
born
knowing
the
way
it
would
seem
that
the
whole
earth
lay
before
them
not
as
a
map
but
as
a
whereon
they
continually
behold
the
changing
pieces
as
well
as
the
squares
any
one
can
find
places
but
the
finding
of
people
is
a
gift
from
god
he
only
stopped
once
to
pick
her
some
great
blue
violets
she
thanked
him
with
real
pleasure
in
the
company
of
this
common
man
the
world
was
beautiful
and
direct
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
influence
of
spring
his
arm
swept
the
horizon
gracefully
violets
like
other
things
existed
in
great
profusion
there
would
she
like
to
see
them
ma
buoni
he
bowed
certainly
good
men
first
violets
afterwards
they
proceeded
briskly
through
the
undergrowth
which
became
thicker
and
thicker
they
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
promontory
and
the
view
was
stealing
round
them
but
the
brown
network
of
the
bushes
shattered
it
into
countless
pieces
he
was
occupied
in
his
cigar
and
in
holding
back
the
pliant
boughs
she
was
rejoicing
in
her
escape
from
dullness
not
a
step
not
a
twig
was
unimportant
to
her
what
is
that
there
was
a
voice
in
the
wood
in
the
distance
behind
them
the
voice
of
mr
eager
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
an
italian
s
ignorance
is
sometimes
more
remarkable
than
his
knowledge
she
could
not
make
him
understand
that
perhaps
they
had
missed
the
clergymen
the
view
was
forming
at
last
she
could
discern
the
river
the
golden
plain
other
hills
eccolo
he
exclaimed
at
the
same
moment
the
ground
gave
way
and
with
a
cry
she
fell
out
of
the
wood
light
and
beauty
enveloped
her
she
had
fallen
on
to
a
little
open
terrace
which
was
covered
with
violets
from
end
to
end
courage
cried
her
companion
now
standing
some
six
feet
above
courage
and
she
did
not
answer
from
her
feet
the
ground
sloped
sharply
into
view
and
violets
ran
down
in
rivulets
and
streams
and
cataracts
irrigating
the
hillside
with
blue
eddying
round
the
tree
stems
collecting
into
pools
in
the
hollows
covering
the
grass
with
spots
of
azure
foam
but
never
again
were
they
in
such
profusion
this
terrace
was
the
the
primal
source
whence
beauty
gushed
out
to
water
the
earth
standing
at
its
brink
like
a
swimmer
who
prepares
was
the
good
man
but
he
was
not
the
good
man
that
she
had
expected
and
he
was
alone
george
had
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
arrival
for
a
moment
he
contemplated
her
as
one
who
had
fallen
out
of
heaven
he
saw
radiant
joy
in
her
face
he
saw
the
flowers
beat
against
her
dress
in
blue
waves
the
bushes
above
them
closed
he
stepped
quickly
forward
and
kissed
her
before
she
could
speak
almost
before
she
could
feel
a
voice
called
lucy
lucy
lucy
the
silence
of
life
had
been
broken
by
miss
bartlett
who
stood
brown
against
the
view
chapter
vii
they
return
some
complicated
game
had
been
playing
up
and
down
the
hillside
all
the
afternoon
what
it
was
and
exactly
how
the
players
had
sided
lucy
was
slow
to
discover
mr
eager
had
met
them
with
a
questioning
eye
charlotte
had
repulsed
him
with
much
small
talk
emerson
seeking
his
son
was
told
whereabouts
to
find
him
beebe
who
wore
the
heated
aspect
of
a
neutral
was
bidden
to
collect
the
factions
for
the
return
home
there
was
a
general
sense
of
groping
and
bewilderment
pan
had
been
amongst
them
not
the
great
god
pan
who
has
been
buried
these
two
thousand
years
but
the
little
god
pan
who
presides
over
social
contretemps
and
unsuccessful
picnics
beebe
had
lost
everyone
and
had
consumed
in
solitude
the
which
he
had
brought
up
as
a
pleasant
surprise
miss
lavish
had
lost
miss
bartlett
lucy
had
lost
mr
eager
emerson
had
lost
george
miss
bartlett
had
lost
a
mackintosh
square
phaethon
had
lost
the
game
that
last
fact
was
undeniable
he
climbed
on
to
the
box
shivering
with
his
collar
up
prophesying
the
swift
approach
of
bad
weather
let
us
go
immediately
he
told
them
the
signorino
will
all
the
way
he
will
be
hours
said
beebe
apparently
i
told
him
it
was
he
would
look
no
one
in
the
face
perhaps
defeat
was
particularly
mortifying
for
him
he
alone
had
played
skilfully
using
the
whole
of
his
instinct
while
the
others
had
used
scraps
of
their
intelligence
he
alone
had
divined
what
things
were
and
what
he
wished
them
to
be
he
alone
had
interpreted
the
message
that
lucy
had
received
five
days
before
from
the
lips
of
a
dying
man
persephone
who
spends
half
her
life
in
the
grave
she
could
interpret
it
also
not
so
these
english
they
gain
knowledge
slowly
and
perhaps
too
late
the
thoughts
of
a
however
just
seldom
affect
the
lives
of
his
employers
he
was
the
most
competent
of
miss
bartlett
s
opponents
but
infinitely
the
least
dangerous
once
back
in
the
town
he
and
his
insight
and
his
knowledge
would
trouble
english
ladies
no
more
of
course
it
was
most
unpleasant
she
had
seen
his
black
head
in
the
bushes
he
might
make
a
tavern
story
out
of
it
but
after
all
what
have
we
to
do
with
taverns
real
menace
belongs
to
the
it
was
of
people
that
miss
bartlett
thought
as
she
journeyed
downwards
towards
the
fading
sun
lucy
sat
beside
her
mr
eager
sat
opposite
trying
to
catch
her
eye
he
was
vaguely
suspicious
they
spoke
of
alessio
baldovinetti
rain
and
darkness
came
on
together
the
two
ladies
huddled
together
under
an
inadequate
parasol
there
was
a
lightning
flash
and
miss
lavish
who
was
nervous
screamed
from
the
carriage
in
front
at
the
next
flash
lucy
screamed
also
mr
eager
addressed
her
professionally
courage
miss
honeychurch
courage
and
faith
if
i
might
say
so
there
is
something
almost
blasphemous
in
this
horror
of
the
elements
are
we
seriously
to
suppose
that
all
these
clouds
all
this
immense
electrical
display
is
simply
called
into
existence
to
extinguish
you
or
me
no
of
course
even
from
the
scientific
standpoint
the
chances
against
our
being
struck
are
enormous
the
steel
knives
the
only
articles
which
might
attract
the
current
are
in
the
other
carriage
and
in
any
case
we
are
infinitely
safer
than
if
we
were
walking
courage
courage
and
under
the
rug
lucy
felt
the
kindly
pressure
of
her
cousin
s
hand
at
times
our
need
for
a
sympathetic
gesture
is
so
great
that
we
care
not
what
exactly
it
signifies
or
how
much
we
may
have
to
pay
for
it
afterwards
miss
bartlett
by
this
timely
exercise
of
her
muscles
gained
more
than
she
would
have
got
in
hours
of
preaching
or
cross
examination
she
renewed
it
when
the
two
carriages
stopped
half
into
florence
mr
eager
called
beebe
we
want
your
assistance
will
you
interpret
for
us
george
cried
emerson
ask
your
driver
which
way
george
went
the
boy
may
lose
his
way
he
may
be
go
eager
said
miss
bartlett
don
t
ask
our
driver
our
driver
is
no
help
go
and
support
poor
beebe
he
is
nearly
he
may
be
killed
cried
the
old
man
he
may
be
killed
typical
behaviour
said
the
chaplain
as
he
quitted
the
carriage
in
the
presence
of
reality
that
kind
of
person
invariably
breaks
what
does
he
know
whispered
lucy
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
charlotte
how
much
does
mr
eager
know
nothing
dearest
he
knows
nothing
but
she
pointed
at
the
he
knows
everything
dearest
had
we
better
shall
i
she
took
out
her
purse
it
is
dreadful
to
be
entangled
with
people
he
saw
it
tapping
phaethon
s
back
with
her
she
said
silenzio
and
offered
him
a
franc
va
bene
he
replied
and
accepted
it
as
well
this
ending
to
his
day
as
any
but
lucy
a
mortal
maid
was
disappointed
in
him
there
was
an
explosion
up
the
road
the
storm
had
struck
the
overhead
wire
of
the
tramline
and
one
of
the
great
supports
had
fallen
if
they
had
not
stopped
perhaps
they
might
have
been
hurt
they
chose
to
regard
it
as
a
miraculous
preservation
and
the
floods
of
love
and
sincerity
which
fructify
every
hour
of
life
burst
forth
in
tumult
they
descended
from
the
carriages
they
embraced
each
other
it
was
as
joyful
to
be
forgiven
past
unworthinesses
as
to
forgive
them
for
a
moment
they
realized
vast
possibilities
of
good
the
older
people
recovered
quickly
in
the
very
height
of
their
emotion
they
knew
it
to
be
unmanly
or
unladylike
miss
lavish
calculated
that
even
if
they
had
continued
they
would
not
have
been
caught
in
the
accident
mr
eager
mumbled
a
temperate
prayer
but
the
drivers
through
miles
of
dark
squalid
road
poured
out
their
souls
to
the
dryads
and
the
saints
and
lucy
poured
out
hers
to
her
cousin
charlotte
dear
charlotte
kiss
me
kiss
me
again
only
you
can
understand
me
you
warned
me
to
be
careful
and
i
i
thought
i
was
do
not
cry
dearest
take
your
i
have
been
obstinate
and
silly
worse
than
you
know
far
worse
once
by
the
river
oh
but
he
isn
t
killed
he
wouldn
t
be
killed
would
he
the
thought
disturbed
her
repentance
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
storm
was
worst
along
the
road
but
she
had
been
near
danger
and
so
she
thought
it
must
be
near
to
everyone
i
trust
not
one
would
always
pray
against
he
is
really
i
think
he
was
taken
by
surprise
just
as
i
was
before
but
this
time
i
m
not
to
blame
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
simply
slipped
into
those
violets
no
i
want
to
be
really
truthful
i
am
a
little
to
blame
i
had
silly
thoughts
the
sky
you
know
was
gold
and
the
ground
all
blue
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
like
someone
in
a
in
a
book
heroes
gods
the
nonsense
of
and
then
but
charlotte
you
know
what
happened
miss
bartlett
was
silent
indeed
she
had
little
more
to
learn
with
a
certain
amount
of
insight
she
drew
her
young
cousin
affectionately
to
her
all
the
way
back
lucy
s
body
was
shaken
by
deep
sighs
which
nothing
could
repress
i
want
to
be
truthful
she
whispered
it
is
so
hard
to
be
absolutely
don
t
be
troubled
dearest
wait
till
you
are
calmer
we
will
talk
it
over
before
in
my
so
they
the
city
with
hands
clasped
it
was
a
shock
to
the
girl
to
find
how
far
emotion
had
ebbed
in
others
the
storm
had
ceased
and
emerson
was
easier
about
his
son
beebe
had
regained
good
humour
and
mr
eager
was
already
snubbing
miss
lavish
charlotte
alone
she
was
sure
of
charlotte
whose
exterior
concealed
so
much
insight
and
love
the
luxury
of
kept
her
almost
happy
through
the
long
evening
she
thought
not
so
much
of
what
had
happened
as
of
how
she
should
describe
it
all
her
sensations
her
spasms
of
courage
her
moments
of
unreasonable
joy
her
mysterious
discontent
should
be
carefully
laid
before
her
cousin
and
together
in
divine
confidence
they
would
disentangle
and
interpret
them
all
at
last
thought
she
i
shall
understand
myself
i
shan
t
again
be
troubled
by
things
that
come
out
of
nothing
and
mean
i
don
t
know
miss
alan
asked
her
to
play
she
refused
vehemently
music
seemed
to
her
the
employment
of
a
child
she
sat
close
to
her
cousin
who
with
commendable
patience
was
listening
to
a
long
story
about
lost
luggage
when
it
was
over
she
capped
it
by
a
story
of
her
own
lucy
became
rather
hysterical
with
the
delay
in
vain
she
tried
to
check
or
at
all
events
to
accelerate
the
tale
it
was
not
till
a
late
hour
that
miss
bartlett
had
recovered
her
luggage
and
could
say
in
her
usual
tone
of
gentle
reproach
well
dear
i
at
all
events
am
ready
for
bedfordshire
come
into
my
room
and
i
will
give
a
good
brush
to
your
with
some
solemnity
the
door
was
shut
and
a
cane
chair
placed
for
the
girl
then
miss
bartlett
said
so
what
is
to
be
done
she
was
unprepared
for
the
question
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
have
to
do
anything
a
detailed
exhibition
of
her
emotions
was
all
that
she
had
counted
upon
what
is
to
be
done
a
point
dearest
which
you
alone
can
the
rain
was
streaming
down
the
black
windows
and
the
great
room
felt
damp
and
chilly
one
candle
burnt
trembling
on
the
chest
of
drawers
close
to
miss
bartlett
s
toque
which
cast
monstrous
and
fantastic
shadows
on
the
bolted
door
a
tram
roared
by
in
the
dark
and
lucy
felt
unaccountably
sad
though
she
had
long
since
dried
her
eyes
she
lifted
them
to
the
ceiling
where
the
griffins
and
bassoons
were
colourless
and
vague
the
very
ghosts
of
joy
it
has
been
raining
for
nearly
four
hours
she
said
at
last
miss
bartlett
ignored
the
remark
how
do
you
propose
to
silence
him
the
driver
my
dear
girl
no
george
lucy
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
i
don
t
understand
she
said
at
last
she
understood
very
well
but
she
no
longer
wished
to
be
absolutely
truthful
how
are
you
going
to
stop
him
talking
about
it
i
have
a
feeling
that
talk
is
a
thing
he
will
never
i
too
intend
to
judge
him
charitably
but
unfortunately
i
have
met
the
type
before
they
seldom
keep
their
exploits
to
exploits
cried
lucy
wincing
under
the
horrible
plural
my
poor
dear
did
you
suppose
that
this
was
his
first
come
here
and
listen
to
me
i
am
only
gathering
it
from
his
own
remarks
do
you
remember
that
day
at
lunch
when
he
argued
with
miss
alan
that
liking
one
person
is
an
extra
reason
for
liking
another
yes
said
lucy
whom
at
the
time
the
argument
had
pleased
well
i
am
no
prude
there
is
no
need
to
call
him
a
wicked
young
man
but
obviously
he
is
thoroughly
unrefined
let
us
put
it
down
to
his
deplorable
antecedents
and
education
if
you
wish
but
we
are
no
farther
on
with
our
question
what
do
you
propose
to
do
an
idea
rushed
across
lucy
s
brain
which
had
she
thought
of
it
sooner
and
made
it
part
of
her
might
have
proved
victorious
i
propose
to
speak
to
him
said
she
miss
bartlett
uttered
a
cry
of
genuine
alarm
you
see
charlotte
your
kindness
i
shall
never
forget
it
but
as
you
said
it
is
my
affair
mine
and
and
you
are
going
to
implore
him
to
beg
him
to
keep
silence
certainly
not
there
would
be
no
difficulty
whatever
you
ask
him
he
answers
yes
or
no
then
it
is
over
i
have
been
frightened
of
him
but
now
i
am
not
one
little
but
we
fear
him
for
you
dear
you
are
so
young
and
inexperienced
you
have
lived
among
such
nice
people
that
you
can
not
realize
what
men
can
be
how
they
can
take
a
brutal
pleasure
in
insulting
a
woman
whom
her
sex
does
not
protect
and
rally
round
this
afternoon
for
example
if
i
had
not
arrived
what
would
have
happened
i
can
t
think
said
lucy
gravely
something
in
her
voice
made
miss
bartlett
repeat
her
question
intoning
it
more
vigorously
what
would
have
happened
if
i
hadn
t
arrived
i
can
t
think
said
lucy
again
when
he
insulted
you
how
would
you
have
replied
i
hadn
t
time
to
think
you
yes
but
won
t
you
tell
me
now
what
you
would
have
done
i
should
have
she
checked
herself
and
broke
the
sentence
off
she
went
up
to
the
dripping
window
and
strained
her
eyes
into
the
darkness
she
could
not
think
what
she
would
have
done
come
away
from
the
window
dear
said
miss
bartlett
you
will
be
seen
from
the
lucy
obeyed
she
was
in
her
cousin
s
power
she
could
not
modulate
out
the
key
of
in
which
she
had
started
neither
of
them
referred
again
to
her
suggestion
that
she
should
speak
to
george
and
settle
the
matter
whatever
it
was
with
him
miss
bartlett
became
plaintive
oh
for
a
real
man
we
are
only
two
women
you
and
beebe
is
hopeless
there
is
mr
eager
but
you
do
not
trust
him
oh
for
your
brother
he
is
young
but
i
know
that
his
sister
s
insult
would
rouse
in
him
a
very
lion
thank
god
chivalry
is
not
yet
dead
there
are
still
left
some
men
who
can
reverence
as
she
spoke
she
pulled
off
her
rings
of
which
she
wore
several
and
ranged
them
upon
the
pin
cushion
then
she
blew
into
her
gloves
and
said
it
will
be
a
push
to
catch
the
morning
train
but
we
must
what
train
the
train
to
she
looked
at
her
gloves
critically
the
girl
received
the
announcement
as
easily
as
it
had
been
given
when
does
the
train
to
rome
go
at
signora
bertolini
would
be
we
must
face
that
said
miss
bartlett
not
liking
to
say
that
she
had
given
notice
already
she
will
make
us
pay
for
a
whole
week
s
i
expect
she
will
however
we
shall
be
much
more
comfortable
at
the
vyses
hotel
isn
t
afternoon
tea
given
there
for
nothing
yes
but
they
pay
extra
for
after
this
remark
she
remained
motionless
and
silent
to
her
tired
eyes
charlotte
throbbed
and
swelled
like
a
ghostly
figure
in
a
dream
they
began
to
sort
their
clothes
for
packing
for
there
was
no
time
to
lose
if
they
were
to
catch
the
train
to
rome
lucy
when
admonished
began
to
move
to
and
fro
between
the
rooms
more
conscious
of
the
discomforts
of
packing
by
candlelight
than
of
a
subtler
charlotte
who
was
practical
without
ability
knelt
by
the
side
of
an
empty
trunk
vainly
endeavouring
to
pave
it
with
books
of
varying
thickness
and
size
she
gave
two
or
three
sighs
for
the
stooping
posture
hurt
her
back
and
for
all
her
diplomacy
she
felt
that
she
was
growing
old
the
girl
heard
her
as
she
entered
the
room
and
was
seized
with
one
of
those
emotional
impulses
to
which
she
could
never
attribute
a
cause
she
only
felt
that
the
candle
would
burn
better
the
packing
go
easier
the
world
be
happier
if
she
could
give
and
receive
some
human
love
the
impulse
had
come
before
but
never
so
strongly
she
knelt
down
by
her
cousin
s
side
and
took
her
in
her
arms
miss
bartlett
returned
the
embrace
with
tenderness
and
warmth
but
she
was
not
a
stupid
woman
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
lucy
did
not
love
her
but
needed
her
to
love
for
it
was
in
ominous
tones
that
she
said
after
a
long
pause
dearest
lucy
how
will
you
ever
forgive
me
lucy
was
on
her
guard
at
once
knowing
by
bitter
experience
what
forgiving
miss
bartlett
meant
her
emotion
relaxed
she
modified
her
embrace
a
little
and
she
said
charlotte
dear
what
do
you
mean
as
if
i
have
anything
to
forgive
you
have
a
great
deal
and
i
have
a
very
great
deal
to
forgive
myself
too
i
know
well
how
much
i
vex
you
at
every
but
no
miss
bartlett
assumed
her
favourite
role
that
of
the
prematurely
aged
martyr
ah
but
yes
i
feel
that
our
tour
together
is
hardly
the
success
i
had
hoped
i
might
have
known
it
would
not
do
you
want
someone
younger
and
stronger
and
more
in
sympathy
with
you
i
am
too
uninteresting
and
only
fit
to
pack
and
unpack
your
please
my
only
consolation
was
that
you
found
people
more
to
your
taste
and
were
often
able
to
leave
me
at
home
i
had
my
own
poor
ideas
of
what
a
lady
ought
to
do
but
i
hope
i
did
not
inflict
them
on
you
more
than
was
necessary
you
had
your
own
way
about
these
rooms
at
all
you
mustn
t
say
these
things
said
lucy
softly
she
still
clung
to
the
hope
that
she
and
charlotte
loved
each
other
heart
and
soul
they
continued
to
pack
in
silence
i
have
been
a
failure
said
miss
bartlett
as
she
struggled
with
the
straps
of
lucy
s
trunk
instead
of
strapping
her
own
failed
to
make
you
happy
failed
in
my
duty
to
your
mother
she
has
been
so
generous
to
me
i
shall
never
face
her
again
after
this
but
mother
will
understand
it
is
not
your
fault
this
trouble
and
it
isn
t
a
disaster
it
is
my
fault
it
is
a
disaster
she
will
never
forgive
me
and
rightly
for
instance
what
right
had
i
to
make
friends
with
miss
lavish
every
when
i
was
here
for
your
sake
if
i
have
vexed
you
it
is
equally
true
that
i
have
neglected
you
your
mother
will
see
this
as
clearly
as
i
do
when
you
tell
lucy
from
a
cowardly
wish
to
improve
the
situation
said
why
need
mother
hear
of
it
but
you
tell
her
everything
i
suppose
i
do
i
dare
not
break
your
confidence
there
is
something
sacred
in
it
unless
you
feel
that
it
is
a
thing
you
could
not
tell
the
girl
would
not
be
degraded
to
this
naturally
i
should
have
told
her
but
in
case
she
should
blame
you
in
any
way
i
promise
i
will
not
i
am
very
willing
not
to
i
will
never
speak
of
it
either
to
her
or
to
any
her
promise
brought
the
interview
to
a
sudden
close
miss
bartlett
pecked
her
smartly
on
both
cheeks
wished
her
and
sent
her
to
her
own
room
for
a
moment
the
original
trouble
was
in
the
background
george
would
seem
to
have
behaved
like
a
cad
throughout
perhaps
that
was
the
view
which
one
would
take
eventually
at
present
she
neither
acquitted
nor
condemned
him
she
did
not
pass
judgement
at
the
moment
when
she
was
about
to
judge
him
her
cousin
s
voice
had
intervened
and
ever
since
it
was
miss
bartlett
who
had
dominated
miss
bartlett
who
even
now
could
be
heard
sighing
into
a
crack
in
the
partition
wall
miss
bartlett
who
had
really
been
neither
pliable
nor
humble
nor
inconsistent
she
had
worked
like
a
great
artist
for
a
time
indeed
for
years
she
had
been
meaningless
but
at
the
end
there
was
presented
to
the
girl
the
complete
picture
of
a
cheerless
loveless
world
in
which
the
young
rush
to
destruction
until
they
learn
better
a
shamefaced
world
of
precautions
and
barriers
which
may
avert
evil
but
which
do
not
seem
to
bring
good
if
we
may
judge
from
those
who
have
used
them
most
lucy
was
suffering
from
the
most
grievous
wrong
which
this
world
has
yet
discovered
diplomatic
advantage
had
been
taken
of
her
sincerity
of
her
craving
for
sympathy
and
love
such
a
wrong
is
not
easily
forgotten
never
again
did
she
expose
herself
without
due
consideration
and
precaution
against
rebuff
and
such
a
wrong
may
react
disastrously
upon
the
soul
the
rang
and
she
started
to
the
shutters
before
she
reached
them
she
hesitated
turned
and
blew
out
the
candle
thus
it
was
that
though
she
saw
someone
standing
in
the
wet
below
he
though
he
looked
up
did
not
see
her
to
reach
his
room
he
had
to
go
by
hers
she
was
still
dressed
it
struck
her
that
she
might
slip
into
the
passage
and
just
say
that
she
would
be
gone
before
he
was
up
and
that
their
extraordinary
intercourse
was
over
whether
she
would
have
dared
to
do
this
was
never
proved
at
the
critical
moment
miss
bartlett
opened
her
own
door
and
her
voice
said
i
wish
one
word
with
you
in
the
emerson
soon
their
footsteps
returned
and
miss
bartlett
said
his
heavy
tired
breathing
was
the
only
reply
the
chaperon
had
done
her
work
lucy
cried
aloud
it
isn
t
true
it
can
t
all
be
true
i
want
not
to
be
muddled
i
want
to
grow
older
miss
bartlett
tapped
on
the
wall
go
to
bed
at
once
dear
you
need
all
the
rest
you
can
in
the
morning
they
left
for
rome
part
two
chapter
viii
medieval
the
curtains
at
windy
corner
had
been
pulled
to
meet
for
the
carpet
was
new
and
deserved
protection
from
the
august
sun
they
were
heavy
curtains
reaching
almost
to
the
ground
and
the
light
that
filtered
through
them
was
subdued
and
varied
a
poet
none
was
present
might
have
quoted
life
like
a
dome
of
many
coloured
glass
or
might
have
compared
the
curtains
to
lowered
against
the
intolerable
tides
of
heaven
without
was
poured
a
sea
of
radiance
within
the
glory
though
visible
was
tempered
to
the
capacities
of
man
two
pleasant
people
sat
in
the
room
one
a
boy
of
nineteen
was
studying
a
small
manual
of
anatomy
and
peering
occasionally
at
a
bone
which
lay
upon
the
piano
from
time
to
time
he
bounced
in
his
chair
and
puffed
and
groaned
for
the
day
was
hot
and
the
print
small
and
the
human
frame
fearfully
made
and
his
mother
who
was
writing
a
letter
did
continually
read
out
to
him
what
she
had
written
and
continually
did
she
rise
from
her
seat
and
part
the
curtains
so
that
a
rivulet
of
light
fell
across
the
carpet
and
make
the
remark
that
they
were
still
there
where
aren
t
they
said
the
boy
who
was
freddy
lucy
s
brother
i
tell
you
i
m
getting
fairly
for
goodness
sake
go
out
of
my
then
cried
honeychurch
who
hoped
to
cure
her
children
of
slang
by
taking
it
literally
freddy
did
not
move
or
reply
i
think
things
are
coming
to
a
head
she
observed
rather
wanting
her
son
s
opinion
on
the
situation
if
she
could
obtain
it
without
undue
supplication
time
they
i
am
glad
that
cecil
is
asking
her
this
once
it
s
his
third
go
isn
t
it
freddy
i
do
call
the
way
you
talk
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
then
he
added
but
i
do
think
lucy
might
have
got
this
off
her
chest
in
italy
i
don
t
know
how
girls
manage
things
but
she
can
t
have
said
no
properly
before
or
she
wouldn
t
have
to
say
it
again
now
over
the
whole
thing
i
can
t
explain
i
do
feel
so
do
you
indeed
dear
how
interesting
i
feel
never
he
returned
to
his
work
just
listen
to
what
i
have
written
to
vyse
i
said
dear
yes
mother
you
told
me
a
jolly
good
i
said
dear
vyse
cecil
has
just
asked
my
permission
about
it
and
i
should
be
delighted
if
lucy
wishes
it
but
she
stopped
reading
i
was
rather
amused
at
cecil
asking
my
permission
at
all
he
has
always
gone
in
for
unconventionality
and
parents
nowhere
and
so
forth
when
it
comes
to
the
point
he
can
t
get
on
without
nor
you
freddy
nodded
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
me
for
my
permission
she
exclaimed
how
very
odd
of
him
why
so
asked
the
son
and
heir
why
shouldn
t
my
permission
be
asked
what
do
you
know
about
lucy
or
girls
or
anything
what
ever
did
you
say
i
said
to
cecil
take
her
or
leave
her
it
s
no
business
of
mine
what
a
helpful
answer
but
her
own
answer
though
more
normal
in
its
wording
had
been
to
the
same
effect
the
bother
is
this
began
freddy
then
he
took
up
his
work
again
too
shy
to
say
what
the
bother
was
honeychurch
went
back
to
the
window
freddy
you
must
come
there
they
still
are
i
don
t
see
you
ought
to
go
peeping
like
peeping
like
that
can
t
i
look
out
of
my
own
window
but
she
returned
to
the
observing
as
she
passed
her
son
still
page
freddy
snorted
and
turned
over
two
leaves
for
a
brief
space
they
were
silent
close
by
beyond
the
curtains
the
gentle
murmur
of
a
long
conversation
had
never
ceased
the
bother
is
this
i
have
put
my
foot
in
it
with
cecil
most
he
gave
a
nervous
gulp
not
content
with
permission
which
i
did
give
that
is
to
say
i
said
i
don
t
mind
well
not
content
with
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
i
wasn
t
off
my
head
with
joy
he
practically
put
it
like
this
wasn
t
it
a
splendid
thing
for
lucy
and
for
windy
corner
generally
if
he
married
her
and
he
would
have
an
answer
he
said
it
would
strengthen
his
i
hope
you
gave
a
careful
answer
i
answered
no
said
the
boy
grinding
his
teeth
there
fly
into
a
stew
i
can
t
help
it
had
to
say
it
i
had
to
say
no
he
ought
never
to
have
asked
ridiculous
child
cried
his
mother
you
think
you
re
so
holy
and
truthful
but
really
it
s
only
abominable
conceit
do
you
suppose
that
a
man
like
cecil
would
take
the
slightest
notice
of
anything
you
say
i
hope
he
boxed
your
ears
how
dare
you
say
no
oh
do
keep
quiet
mother
i
had
to
say
no
when
i
couldn
t
say
yes
i
tried
to
laugh
as
if
i
didn
t
mean
what
i
said
and
as
cecil
laughed
too
and
went
away
it
may
be
all
right
but
i
feel
my
foot
s
in
it
oh
do
keep
quiet
though
and
let
a
man
do
some
no
said
honeychurch
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
considered
the
subject
i
shall
not
keep
quiet
you
know
all
that
has
passed
between
them
in
rome
you
know
why
he
is
down
here
and
yet
you
deliberately
insult
him
and
try
to
turn
him
out
of
my
not
a
bit
he
pleaded
i
only
let
out
i
didn
t
like
him
i
don
t
hate
him
but
i
don
t
like
him
what
i
mind
is
that
he
ll
tell
he
glanced
at
the
curtains
dismally
well
i
like
him
said
honeychurch
i
know
his
mother
he
s
good
he
s
clever
he
s
rich
he
s
well
connected
oh
you
needn
t
kick
the
piano
he
s
well
connected
i
ll
say
it
again
if
you
like
he
s
well
she
paused
as
if
rehearsing
her
eulogy
but
her
face
remained
dissatisfied
she
added
and
he
has
beautiful
i
liked
him
till
just
now
i
suppose
it
s
having
him
spoiling
lucy
s
first
week
at
home
and
it
s
also
something
that
beebe
said
not
mr
beebe
said
his
mother
trying
to
conceal
her
interest
i
don
t
see
how
beebe
comes
you
know
beebe
s
funny
way
when
you
never
quite
know
what
he
means
he
said
mr
vyse
is
an
ideal
i
was
very
cute
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
said
oh
he
s
like
me
better
i
couldn
t
make
him
say
any
more
but
it
set
me
thinking
since
cecil
has
come
after
lucy
he
hasn
t
been
so
pleasant
at
least
i
can
t
you
never
can
dear
but
i
can
you
are
jealous
of
cecil
because
he
may
stop
lucy
knitting
you
silk
the
explanation
seemed
plausible
and
freddy
tried
to
accept
it
but
at
the
back
of
his
brain
there
lurked
a
dim
mistrust
cecil
praised
one
too
much
for
being
athletic
was
that
it
cecil
made
one
talk
in
one
s
own
way
this
tired
one
was
that
it
and
cecil
was
the
kind
of
fellow
who
would
never
wear
another
fellow
s
cap
unaware
of
his
own
profundity
freddy
checked
himself
he
must
be
jealous
or
he
would
not
dislike
a
man
for
such
foolish
reasons
will
this
do
called
his
mother
dear
vyse
cecil
has
just
asked
my
permission
about
it
and
i
should
be
delighted
if
lucy
wishes
then
i
put
in
at
the
top
and
i
have
told
lucy
i
must
write
the
letter
out
again
and
i
have
told
lucy
so
but
lucy
seems
very
uncertain
and
in
these
days
young
people
must
decide
for
i
said
that
because
i
didn
t
want
vyse
to
think
us
she
goes
in
for
lectures
and
improving
her
mind
and
all
the
time
a
thick
layer
of
flue
under
the
beds
and
the
maid
s
dirty
where
you
turn
on
the
electric
light
she
keeps
that
flat
abominably
suppose
lucy
marries
cecil
would
she
live
in
a
flat
or
in
the
country
don
t
interrupt
so
foolishly
where
was
i
oh
yes
young
people
must
decide
for
themselves
i
know
that
lucy
likes
your
son
because
she
tells
me
everything
and
she
wrote
to
me
from
rome
when
he
asked
her
no
i
ll
cross
that
last
bit
out
it
looks
patronizing
i
ll
stop
at
because
she
tells
me
or
shall
i
cross
that
out
too
cross
it
out
too
said
freddy
honeychurch
left
it
in
then
the
whole
thing
runs
dear
mrs
cecil
has
just
asked
my
permission
about
it
and
i
should
be
delighted
if
lucy
wishes
it
and
i
have
told
lucy
so
but
lucy
seems
very
uncertain
and
in
these
days
young
people
must
decide
for
themselves
i
know
that
lucy
likes
your
son
because
she
tells
me
everything
but
i
do
not
know
look
out
cried
freddy
the
curtains
parted
cecil
s
first
movement
was
one
of
irritation
he
couldn
t
bear
the
honeychurch
habit
of
sitting
in
the
dark
to
save
the
furniture
instinctively
he
give
the
curtains
a
twitch
and
sent
them
swinging
down
their
poles
light
entered
there
was
revealed
a
terrace
such
as
is
owned
by
many
villas
with
trees
each
side
of
it
and
on
it
a
little
rustic
seat
and
two
but
it
was
transfigured
by
the
view
beyond
for
windy
corner
was
built
on
the
range
that
overlooks
the
sussex
weald
lucy
who
was
in
the
little
seat
seemed
on
the
edge
of
a
green
magic
carpet
which
hovered
in
the
air
above
the
tremulous
world
cecil
entered
appearing
thus
late
in
the
story
cecil
must
be
at
once
described
he
was
medieval
like
a
gothic
statue
tall
and
refined
with
shoulders
that
seemed
braced
square
by
an
effort
of
the
will
and
a
head
that
was
tilted
a
little
higher
than
the
usual
level
of
vision
he
resembled
those
fastidious
saints
who
guard
the
portals
of
a
french
cathedral
well
educated
well
endowed
and
not
deficient
physically
he
remained
in
the
grip
of
a
certain
devil
whom
the
modern
world
knows
as
and
whom
the
medieval
with
dimmer
vision
worshipped
as
asceticism
a
gothic
statue
implies
celibacy
just
as
a
greek
statue
implies
fruition
and
perhaps
this
was
what
beebe
meant
and
freddy
who
ignored
history
and
art
perhaps
meant
the
same
when
he
failed
to
imagine
cecil
wearing
another
fellow
s
cap
honeychurch
left
her
letter
on
the
writing
table
and
moved
towards
her
young
acquaintance
oh
cecil
she
exclaimed
oh
cecil
do
tell
me
i
promessi
sposi
said
he
they
stared
at
him
anxiously
she
has
accepted
me
he
said
and
the
sound
of
the
thing
in
english
made
him
flush
and
smile
with
pleasure
and
look
more
human
i
am
so
glad
said
honeychurch
while
freddy
proffered
a
hand
that
was
yellow
with
chemicals
they
wished
that
they
also
knew
italian
for
our
phrases
of
approval
and
of
amazement
are
so
connected
with
little
occasions
that
we
fear
to
use
them
on
great
ones
we
are
obliged
to
become
vaguely
poetic
or
to
take
refuge
in
scriptural
reminiscences
welcome
as
one
of
the
family
said
honeychurch
waving
her
hand
at
the
furniture
this
is
indeed
a
joyous
day
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
make
our
dear
lucy
i
hope
so
replied
the
young
man
shifting
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
we
mothers
simpered
honeychurch
and
then
realized
that
she
was
affected
sentimental
bombastic
all
the
things
she
hated
most
why
could
she
not
be
freddy
who
stood
stiff
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
very
cross
and
almost
handsome
i
say
lucy
called
cecil
for
conversation
seemed
to
flag
lucy
rose
from
the
seat
she
moved
across
the
lawn
and
smiled
in
at
them
just
as
if
she
was
going
to
ask
them
to
play
tennis
then
she
saw
her
brother
s
face
her
lips
parted
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
he
said
steady
on
not
a
kiss
for
me
asked
her
mother
lucy
kissed
her
also
would
you
take
them
into
the
garden
and
tell
honeychurch
all
about
it
cecil
suggested
and
i
d
stop
here
and
tell
my
we
go
with
lucy
said
freddy
as
if
taking
orders
yes
you
go
with
they
passed
into
the
sunlight
cecil
watched
them
cross
the
terrace
and
descend
out
of
sight
by
the
steps
they
would
descend
he
knew
their
ways
past
the
shrubbery
and
past
the
and
the
until
they
reached
the
kitchen
garden
and
there
in
the
presence
of
the
potatoes
and
the
peas
the
great
event
would
be
discussed
smiling
indulgently
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
rehearsed
the
events
that
had
led
to
such
a
happy
conclusion
he
had
known
lucy
for
several
years
but
only
as
a
commonplace
girl
who
happened
to
be
musical
he
could
still
remember
his
depression
that
afternoon
at
rome
when
she
and
her
terrible
cousin
fell
on
him
out
of
the
blue
and
demanded
to
be
taken
to
peter
s
that
day
she
had
seemed
a
typical
tourist
shrill
crude
and
gaunt
with
travel
but
italy
worked
some
marvel
in
her
it
gave
her
light
and
which
he
held
more
precious
it
gave
her
shadow
soon
he
detected
in
her
a
wonderful
reticence
she
was
like
a
woman
of
leonardo
da
vinci
s
whom
we
love
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
the
things
that
she
will
not
tell
us
the
things
are
assuredly
not
of
this
life
no
woman
of
leonardo
s
could
have
anything
so
vulgar
as
a
she
did
develop
most
wonderfully
day
by
day
so
it
happened
that
from
patronizing
civility
he
had
slowly
passed
if
not
to
passion
at
least
to
a
profound
uneasiness
already
at
rome
he
had
hinted
to
her
that
they
might
be
suitable
for
each
other
it
had
touched
him
greatly
that
she
had
not
broken
away
at
the
suggestion
her
refusal
had
been
clear
and
gentle
after
it
as
the
horrid
phrase
went
she
had
been
exactly
the
same
to
him
as
before
three
months
later
on
the
margin
of
italy
among
the
alps
he
had
asked
her
again
in
bald
traditional
language
she
reminded
him
of
a
leonardo
more
than
ever
her
sunburnt
features
were
shadowed
by
fantastic
rock
at
his
words
she
had
turned
and
stood
between
him
and
the
light
with
immeasurable
plains
behind
her
he
walked
home
with
her
unashamed
feeling
not
at
all
like
a
rejected
suitor
the
things
that
really
mattered
were
unshaken
so
now
he
had
asked
her
once
more
and
clear
and
gentle
as
ever
she
had
accepted
him
giving
no
coy
reasons
for
her
delay
but
simply
saying
that
she
loved
him
and
would
do
her
best
to
make
him
happy
his
mother
too
would
be
pleased
she
had
counselled
the
step
he
must
write
her
a
long
account
glancing
at
his
hand
in
case
any
of
freddy
s
chemicals
had
come
off
on
it
he
moved
to
the
writing
table
there
he
saw
dear
vyse
followed
by
many
erasures
he
recoiled
without
reading
any
more
and
after
a
little
hesitation
sat
down
elsewhere
and
pencilled
a
note
on
his
knee
then
he
lit
another
cigarette
which
did
not
seem
quite
as
divine
as
the
first
and
considered
what
might
be
done
to
make
windy
corner
more
distinctive
with
that
outlook
it
should
have
been
a
successful
room
but
the
trail
of
tottenham
court
road
was
upon
it
he
could
almost
visualize
the
of
shoolbred
and
messrs
maple
arriving
at
the
door
and
depositing
this
chair
those
varnished
that
the
table
recalled
honeychurch
s
letter
he
did
not
want
to
read
that
letter
his
temptations
never
lay
in
that
direction
but
he
worried
about
it
none
the
less
it
was
his
own
fault
that
she
was
discussing
him
with
his
mother
he
had
wanted
her
support
in
his
third
attempt
to
win
lucy
he
wanted
to
feel
that
others
no
matter
who
they
were
agreed
with
him
and
so
he
had
asked
their
permission
honeychurch
had
been
civil
but
obtuse
in
essentials
while
as
for
freddy
he
is
only
a
boy
he
reflected
i
represent
all
that
he
despises
why
should
he
want
me
for
a
the
honeychurches
were
a
worthy
family
but
he
began
to
realize
that
lucy
was
of
another
clay
and
perhaps
he
did
not
put
it
very
definitely
he
ought
to
introduce
her
into
more
congenial
circles
as
soon
as
possible
mr
beebe
said
the
maid
and
the
new
rector
of
summer
street
was
shown
in
he
had
at
once
started
on
friendly
relations
owing
to
lucy
s
praise
of
him
in
her
letters
from
florence
cecil
greeted
him
rather
critically
i
ve
come
for
tea
vyse
do
you
suppose
that
i
shall
get
it
i
should
say
so
food
is
the
thing
one
does
get
here
don
t
sit
in
that
chair
young
honeychurch
has
left
a
bone
in
pfui
i
know
said
cecil
i
know
i
can
t
think
why
honeychurch
allows
for
cecil
considered
the
bone
and
the
maples
furniture
separately
he
did
not
realize
that
taken
together
they
kindled
the
room
into
the
life
that
he
desired
i
ve
come
for
tea
and
for
gossip
isn
t
this
news
news
i
don
t
understand
you
said
cecil
news
beebe
whose
news
was
of
a
very
different
nature
prattled
forward
i
met
sir
harry
otway
as
i
came
up
i
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
i
am
first
in
the
field
he
has
bought
cissie
and
albert
from
flack
has
he
indeed
said
cecil
trying
to
recover
himself
into
what
a
grotesque
mistake
had
he
fallen
was
it
likely
that
a
clergyman
and
a
gentleman
would
refer
to
his
engagement
in
a
manner
so
flippant
but
his
stiffness
remained
and
though
he
asked
who
cissie
and
albert
might
be
he
still
thought
beebe
rather
a
bounder
unpardonable
question
to
have
stopped
a
week
at
windy
corner
and
not
to
have
met
cissie
and
albert
the
villas
that
have
been
run
up
opposite
the
church
i
ll
set
honeychurch
after
i
m
shockingly
stupid
over
local
affairs
said
the
young
man
languidly
i
can
t
even
remember
the
difference
between
a
parish
council
and
a
local
government
board
perhaps
there
is
no
difference
or
perhaps
those
aren
t
the
right
names
i
only
go
into
the
country
to
see
my
friends
and
to
enjoy
the
scenery
it
is
very
remiss
of
me
italy
and
london
are
the
only
places
where
i
don
t
feel
to
exist
on
beebe
distressed
at
this
heavy
reception
of
cissie
and
albert
determined
to
shift
the
subject
let
me
see
vyse
i
forget
what
is
your
profession
i
have
no
profession
said
cecil
it
is
another
example
of
my
decadence
my
attitude
quite
an
indefensible
one
is
that
so
long
as
i
am
no
trouble
to
any
one
i
have
a
right
to
do
as
i
like
i
know
i
ought
to
be
getting
money
out
of
people
or
devoting
myself
to
things
i
don
t
care
a
straw
about
but
somehow
i
ve
not
been
able
to
you
are
very
fortunate
said
beebe
it
is
a
wonderful
opportunity
the
possession
of
his
voice
was
rather
parochial
but
he
did
not
quite
see
his
way
to
answering
naturally
he
felt
as
all
who
have
regular
occupation
must
feel
that
others
should
have
it
also
i
am
glad
that
you
approve
i
daren
t
face
the
healthy
person
for
example
freddy
oh
freddy
s
a
good
sort
isn
t
he
admirable
the
sort
who
has
made
england
what
she
cecil
wondered
at
himself
why
on
this
day
of
all
others
was
he
so
hopelessly
contrary
he
tried
to
get
right
by
inquiring
effusively
after
beebe
s
mother
an
old
lady
for
whom
he
had
no
particular
regard
then
he
flattered
the
clergyman
praised
his
his
enlightened
attitude
towards
philosophy
and
science
where
are
the
others
said
beebe
at
last
i
insist
on
extracting
tea
before
evening
i
suppose
anne
never
told
them
you
were
here
in
this
house
one
is
so
coached
in
the
servants
the
day
one
arrives
the
fault
of
anne
is
that
she
begs
your
pardon
when
she
hears
you
perfectly
and
kicks
the
with
her
feet
the
faults
of
mary
i
forget
the
faults
of
mary
but
they
are
very
grave
shall
we
look
in
the
garden
i
know
the
faults
of
mary
she
leaves
the
standing
on
the
the
fault
of
euphemia
is
that
she
will
not
simply
will
not
chop
the
suet
sufficiently
they
both
laughed
and
things
began
to
go
better
the
faults
of
freddy
cecil
continued
ah
he
has
too
many
no
one
but
his
mother
can
remember
the
faults
of
freddy
try
the
faults
of
miss
honeychurch
they
are
not
she
has
none
said
the
young
man
with
grave
sincerity
i
quite
agree
at
present
she
has
at
present
i
m
not
cynical
i
m
only
thinking
of
my
pet
theory
about
miss
honeychurch
does
it
seem
reasonable
that
she
should
play
so
wonderfully
and
live
so
quietly
i
suspect
that
one
day
she
will
be
wonderful
in
both
the
compartments
in
her
will
break
down
and
music
and
life
will
mingle
then
we
shall
have
her
heroically
good
heroically
bad
too
heroic
perhaps
to
be
good
or
cecil
found
his
companion
interesting
and
at
present
you
think
her
not
wonderful
as
far
as
life
goes
well
i
must
say
i
ve
only
seen
her
at
tunbridge
wells
where
she
was
not
wonderful
and
at
florence
since
i
came
to
summer
street
she
has
been
away
you
saw
her
didn
t
you
at
rome
and
in
the
alps
oh
i
forgot
of
course
you
knew
her
before
no
she
wasn
t
wonderful
in
florence
either
but
i
kept
on
expecting
that
she
would
in
what
way
conversation
had
become
agreeable
to
them
and
they
were
pacing
up
and
down
the
terrace
i
could
as
easily
tell
you
what
tune
she
ll
play
next
there
was
simply
the
sense
that
she
had
found
wings
and
meant
to
use
them
i
can
show
you
a
beautiful
picture
in
my
italian
diary
miss
honeychurch
as
a
kite
miss
bartlett
holding
the
string
picture
number
two
the
string
the
sketch
was
in
his
diary
but
it
had
been
made
afterwards
when
he
viewed
things
artistically
at
the
time
he
had
given
surreptitious
tugs
to
the
string
himself
but
the
string
never
broke
no
i
mightn
t
have
seen
miss
honeychurch
rise
but
i
should
certainly
have
heard
miss
bartlett
it
has
broken
now
said
the
young
man
in
low
vibrating
tones
immediately
he
realized
that
of
all
the
conceited
ludicrous
contemptible
ways
of
announcing
an
engagement
this
was
the
worst
he
cursed
his
love
of
metaphor
had
he
suggested
that
he
was
a
star
and
that
lucy
was
soaring
up
to
reach
him
broken
what
do
you
mean
i
meant
said
cecil
stiffly
that
she
is
going
to
marry
the
clergyman
was
conscious
of
some
bitter
disappointment
which
he
could
not
keep
out
of
his
voice
i
am
sorry
i
must
apologize
i
had
no
idea
you
were
intimate
with
her
or
i
should
never
have
talked
in
this
flippant
superficial
way
vyse
you
ought
to
have
stopped
and
down
the
garden
he
saw
lucy
herself
yes
he
was
disappointed
cecil
who
naturally
preferred
congratulations
to
apologies
drew
down
his
mouth
at
the
corners
was
this
the
reception
his
action
would
get
from
the
world
of
course
he
despised
the
world
as
a
whole
every
thoughtful
man
should
it
is
almost
a
test
of
refinement
but
he
was
sensitive
to
the
successive
particles
of
it
which
he
encountered
occasionally
he
could
be
quite
crude
i
am
sorry
i
have
given
you
a
shock
he
said
dryly
i
fear
that
lucy
s
choice
does
not
meet
with
your
not
that
but
you
ought
to
have
stopped
me
i
know
miss
honeychurch
only
a
little
as
time
goes
perhaps
i
oughtn
t
to
have
discussed
her
so
freely
with
any
one
certainly
not
with
you
are
conscious
of
having
said
something
indiscreet
beebe
pulled
himself
together
really
vyse
had
the
art
of
placing
one
in
the
most
tiresome
positions
he
was
driven
to
use
the
prerogatives
of
his
profession
no
i
have
said
nothing
indiscreet
i
foresaw
at
florence
that
her
quiet
uneventful
childhood
must
end
and
it
has
ended
i
realized
dimly
enough
that
she
might
take
some
momentous
step
she
has
taken
it
she
has
learnt
you
will
let
me
talk
freely
as
i
have
begun
freely
she
has
learnt
what
it
is
to
love
the
greatest
lesson
some
people
will
tell
you
that
our
earthly
life
it
was
now
time
for
him
to
wave
his
hat
at
the
approaching
trio
he
did
not
omit
to
do
so
she
has
learnt
through
you
and
if
his
voice
was
still
clerical
it
was
now
also
sincere
let
it
be
your
care
that
her
knowledge
is
profitable
to
grazie
tante
said
cecil
who
did
not
like
parsons
have
you
heard
shouted
honeychurch
as
she
toiled
up
the
sloping
garden
oh
beebe
have
you
heard
the
news
freddy
now
full
of
geniality
whistled
the
wedding
march
youth
seldom
criticizes
the
accomplished
fact
indeed
i
have
he
cried
he
looked
at
lucy
in
her
presence
he
could
not
act
the
parson
any
longer
at
all
events
not
without
apology
mrs
honeychurch
i
m
going
to
do
what
i
am
always
supposed
to
do
but
generally
i
m
too
shy
i
want
to
invoke
every
kind
of
blessing
on
them
grave
and
gay
great
and
small
i
want
them
all
their
lives
to
be
supremely
good
and
supremely
happy
as
husband
and
wife
as
father
and
mother
and
now
i
want
my
you
only
asked
for
it
just
in
time
the
lady
retorted
how
dare
you
be
serious
at
windy
corner
he
took
his
tone
from
her
there
was
no
more
heavy
beneficence
no
more
attempts
to
dignify
the
situation
with
poetry
or
the
scriptures
none
of
them
dared
or
was
able
to
be
serious
any
more
an
engagement
is
so
potent
a
thing
that
sooner
or
later
it
reduces
all
who
speak
of
it
to
this
state
of
cheerful
awe
away
from
it
in
the
solitude
of
their
rooms
beebe
and
even
freddy
might
again
be
critical
but
in
its
presence
and
in
the
presence
of
each
other
they
were
sincerely
hilarious
it
has
a
strange
power
for
it
compels
not
only
the
lips
but
the
very
heart
the
chief
parallel
to
compare
one
great
thing
with
another
is
the
power
over
us
of
a
temple
of
some
alien
creed
standing
outside
we
deride
or
oppose
it
or
at
the
most
feel
sentimental
inside
though
the
saints
and
gods
are
not
ours
we
become
true
believers
in
case
any
true
believer
should
be
present
so
it
was
that
after
the
gropings
and
the
misgivings
of
the
afternoon
they
pulled
themselves
together
and
settled
down
to
a
very
pleasant
if
they
were
hypocrites
they
did
not
know
it
and
their
hypocrisy
had
every
chance
of
setting
and
of
becoming
true
anne
putting
down
each
plate
as
if
it
were
a
wedding
present
stimulated
them
greatly
they
could
not
lag
behind
that
smile
of
hers
which
she
gave
them
ere
she
kicked
the
door
beebe
chirruped
freddy
was
at
his
wittiest
referring
to
cecil
as
the
fiasco
family
honoured
pun
on
fiance
honeychurch
amusing
and
portly
promised
well
as
a
as
for
lucy
and
cecil
for
whom
the
temple
had
been
built
they
also
joined
in
the
merry
ritual
but
waited
as
earnest
worshippers
should
for
the
disclosure
of
some
holier
shrine
of
joy
chapter
ix
lucy
as
a
work
of
art
a
few
days
after
the
engagement
was
announced
honeychurch
made
lucy
and
her
fiasco
come
to
a
little
in
the
neighbourhood
for
naturally
she
wanted
to
show
people
that
her
daughter
was
marrying
a
presentable
man
cecil
was
more
than
presentable
he
looked
distinguished
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
his
slim
figure
keeping
step
with
lucy
and
his
long
fair
face
responding
when
lucy
spoke
to
him
people
congratulated
honeychurch
which
is
i
believe
a
social
blunder
but
it
pleased
her
and
she
introduced
cecil
rather
indiscriminately
to
some
stuffy
dowagers
at
tea
a
misfortune
took
place
a
cup
of
coffee
was
upset
over
lucy
s
figured
silk
and
though
lucy
feigned
indifference
her
mother
feigned
nothing
of
the
sort
but
dragged
her
indoors
to
have
the
frock
treated
by
a
sympathetic
maid
they
were
gone
some
time
and
cecil
was
left
with
the
dowagers
when
they
returned
he
was
not
as
pleasant
as
he
had
been
do
you
go
to
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
he
asked
when
they
were
driving
home
oh
now
and
then
said
lucy
who
had
rather
enjoyed
herself
is
it
typical
of
country
society
i
suppose
so
mother
would
it
be
plenty
of
society
said
honeychurch
who
was
trying
to
remember
the
hang
of
one
of
the
dresses
seeing
that
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
cecil
bent
towards
lucy
and
said
to
me
it
seemed
perfectly
appalling
disastrous
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
were
not
that
but
the
congratulations
it
is
so
disgusting
the
way
an
engagement
is
regarded
as
public
property
a
kind
of
waste
place
where
every
outsider
may
shoot
his
vulgar
sentiment
all
those
old
women
smirking
one
has
to
go
through
it
i
suppose
they
won
t
notice
us
so
much
next
but
my
point
is
that
their
whole
attitude
is
wrong
an
engagement
horrid
word
in
the
first
place
is
a
private
matter
and
should
be
treated
as
yet
the
smirking
old
women
however
wrong
individually
were
racially
correct
the
spirit
of
the
generations
had
smiled
through
them
rejoicing
in
the
engagement
of
cecil
and
lucy
because
it
promised
the
continuance
of
life
on
earth
to
cecil
and
lucy
it
promised
something
quite
different
personal
love
hence
cecil
s
irritation
and
lucy
s
belief
that
his
irritation
was
just
how
tiresome
she
said
couldn
t
you
have
escaped
to
tennis
i
don
t
play
tennis
at
least
not
in
public
the
neighbourhood
is
deprived
of
the
romance
of
me
being
athletic
such
romance
as
i
have
is
that
of
the
inglese
inglese
italianato
e
un
diavolo
incarnato
you
know
the
proverb
she
did
not
nor
did
it
seem
applicable
to
a
young
man
who
had
spent
a
quiet
winter
in
rome
with
his
mother
but
cecil
since
his
engagement
had
taken
to
affect
a
cosmopolitan
naughtiness
which
he
was
far
from
possessing
well
said
he
i
can
not
help
it
if
they
do
disapprove
of
me
there
are
certain
irremovable
barriers
between
myself
and
them
and
i
must
accept
we
all
have
our
limitations
i
suppose
said
wise
lucy
sometimes
they
are
forced
on
us
though
said
cecil
who
saw
from
her
remark
that
she
did
not
quite
understand
his
position
how
it
makes
a
difference
doesn
t
it
whether
we
fully
fence
ourselves
in
or
whether
we
are
fenced
out
by
the
barriers
of
others
she
thought
a
moment
and
agreed
that
it
did
make
a
difference
difference
cried
honeychurch
suddenly
alert
i
don
t
see
any
difference
fences
are
fences
especially
when
they
are
in
the
same
we
were
speaking
of
motives
said
cecil
on
whom
the
interruption
jarred
my
dear
cecil
look
she
spread
out
her
knees
and
perched
her
on
her
lap
this
is
me
that
s
windy
corner
the
rest
of
the
pattern
is
the
other
people
motives
are
all
very
well
but
the
fence
comes
we
weren
t
talking
of
real
fences
said
lucy
laughing
oh
i
see
dear
she
leant
placidly
back
cecil
wondered
why
lucy
had
been
amused
i
tell
you
who
has
no
fences
as
you
call
them
she
said
and
that
s
a
parson
fenceless
would
mean
a
parson
lucy
was
slow
to
follow
what
people
said
but
quick
enough
to
detect
what
they
meant
she
missed
cecil
s
epigram
but
grasped
the
feeling
that
prompted
it
don
t
you
like
beebe
she
asked
thoughtfully
i
never
said
so
he
cried
i
consider
him
far
above
the
average
i
only
denied
and
he
swept
off
on
the
subject
of
fences
again
and
was
brilliant
now
a
clergyman
that
i
do
hate
said
she
wanting
to
say
something
sympathetic
a
clergyman
that
does
have
fences
and
the
most
dreadful
ones
is
mr
eager
the
english
chaplain
at
florence
he
was
truly
insincere
not
merely
the
manner
unfortunate
he
was
a
snob
and
so
conceited
and
he
did
say
such
unkind
what
sort
of
things
there
was
an
old
man
at
the
bertolini
whom
he
said
had
murdered
his
perhaps
he
no
why
no
he
was
such
a
nice
old
man
i
m
cecil
laughed
at
her
feminine
inconsequence
well
i
did
try
to
sift
the
thing
mr
eager
would
never
come
to
the
point
he
prefers
it
vague
said
the
old
man
had
practically
murdered
his
wife
had
murdered
her
in
the
sight
of
hush
dear
said
honeychurch
absently
but
isn
t
it
intolerable
that
a
person
whom
we
re
told
to
imitate
should
go
round
spreading
slander
it
was
i
believe
chiefly
owing
to
him
that
the
old
man
was
dropped
people
pretended
he
was
vulgar
but
he
certainly
wasn
t
poor
old
man
what
was
his
name
harris
said
lucy
glibly
let
s
hope
that
harris
there
warn
t
no
sich
person
said
her
mother
cecil
nodded
intelligently
isn
t
mr
eager
a
parson
of
the
cultured
type
he
asked
i
don
t
know
i
hate
him
i
ve
heard
him
lecture
on
giotto
i
hate
him
nothing
can
hide
a
petty
nature
i
hate
my
goodness
gracious
me
child
said
honeychurch
you
ll
blow
my
head
off
whatever
is
there
to
shout
over
i
forbid
you
and
cecil
to
hate
any
more
he
smiled
there
was
indeed
something
rather
incongruous
in
lucy
s
moral
outburst
over
mr
eager
it
was
as
if
one
should
see
the
leonardo
on
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
he
longed
to
hint
to
her
that
not
here
lay
her
vocation
that
a
woman
s
power
and
charm
reside
in
mystery
not
in
muscular
rant
but
possibly
rant
is
a
sign
of
vitality
it
mars
the
beautiful
creature
but
shows
that
she
is
alive
after
a
moment
he
contemplated
her
flushed
face
and
excited
gestures
with
a
certain
approval
he
forebore
to
repress
the
sources
of
youth
nature
simplest
of
topics
he
thought
lay
around
them
he
praised
the
the
deep
lasts
of
bracken
the
crimson
leaves
that
spotted
the
the
serviceable
beauty
of
the
turnpike
road
the
outdoor
world
was
not
very
familiar
to
him
and
occasionally
he
went
wrong
in
a
question
of
fact
honeychurch
s
mouth
twitched
when
he
spoke
of
the
perpetual
green
of
the
larch
i
count
myself
a
lucky
person
he
concluded
when
i
m
in
london
i
feel
i
could
never
live
out
of
it
when
i
m
in
the
country
i
feel
the
same
about
the
country
after
all
i
do
believe
that
birds
and
trees
and
the
sky
are
the
most
wonderful
things
in
life
and
that
the
people
who
live
amongst
them
must
be
the
best
it
s
true
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
don
t
seem
to
notice
anything
the
country
gentleman
and
the
country
labourer
are
each
in
their
way
the
most
depressing
of
companions
yet
they
may
have
a
tacit
sympathy
with
the
workings
of
nature
which
is
denied
to
us
of
the
town
do
you
feel
that
honeychurch
honeychurch
started
and
smiled
she
had
not
been
attending
cecil
who
was
rather
crushed
on
the
front
seat
of
the
victoria
felt
irritable
and
determined
not
to
say
anything
interesting
again
lucy
had
not
attended
either
her
brow
was
wrinkled
and
she
still
looked
furiously
cross
the
result
he
concluded
of
too
much
moral
gymnastics
it
was
sad
to
see
her
thus
blind
to
the
beauties
of
an
august
wood
come
down
o
maid
from
yonder
mountain
height
he
quoted
and
touched
her
knee
with
his
own
she
flushed
again
and
said
what
height
come
down
o
maid
from
yonder
mountain
height
what
pleasure
lives
in
height
the
shepherd
sang
in
height
and
in
the
splendour
of
the
hills
let
us
take
honeychurch
s
advice
and
hate
clergymen
no
more
what
s
this
place
summer
street
of
course
said
lucy
and
roused
herself
the
woods
had
opened
to
leave
space
for
a
sloping
triangular
meadow
pretty
cottages
lined
it
on
two
sides
and
the
upper
and
third
side
was
occupied
by
a
new
stone
church
expensively
simple
a
charming
shingled
spire
beebe
s
house
was
near
the
church
in
height
it
scarcely
exceeded
the
cottages
some
great
mansions
were
at
hand
but
they
were
hidden
in
the
trees
the
scene
suggested
a
swiss
alp
rather
than
the
shrine
and
centre
of
a
leisured
world
and
was
marred
only
by
two
ugly
little
villas
the
villas
that
had
competed
with
cecil
s
engagement
having
been
acquired
by
sir
harry
otway
the
very
afternoon
that
lucy
had
been
acquired
by
cecil
cissie
was
the
name
of
one
of
these
villas
albert
of
the
other
these
titles
were
not
only
picked
out
in
shaded
gothic
on
the
garden
gates
but
appeared
a
second
time
on
the
porches
where
they
followed
the
semicircular
curve
of
the
entrance
arch
in
block
capitals
albert
was
inhabited
his
tortured
garden
was
bright
with
geraniums
and
lobelias
and
polished
shells
his
little
windows
were
chastely
swathed
in
nottingham
lace
cissie
was
to
let
three
belonging
to
dorking
agents
lolled
on
her
fence
and
announced
the
not
surprising
fact
her
paths
were
already
weedy
her
of
a
lawn
was
yellow
with
dandelions
the
place
is
ruined
said
the
ladies
mechanically
summer
street
will
never
be
the
same
as
the
carriage
passed
cissie
s
door
opened
and
a
gentleman
came
out
of
her
stop
cried
honeychurch
touching
the
coachman
with
her
parasol
here
s
sir
harry
now
we
shall
know
sir
harry
pull
those
things
down
at
once
sir
harry
otway
who
need
not
be
described
came
to
the
carriage
and
said
mrs
honeychurch
i
meant
to
i
can
t
i
really
can
t
turn
out
miss
am
i
not
always
right
she
ought
to
have
gone
before
the
contract
was
signed
does
she
still
live
rent
free
as
she
did
in
her
nephew
s
time
but
what
can
i
do
he
lowered
his
voice
an
old
lady
so
very
vulgar
and
almost
turn
her
out
said
cecil
bravely
sir
harry
sighed
and
looked
at
the
villas
mournfully
he
had
had
full
warning
of
flack
s
intentions
and
might
have
bought
the
plot
before
building
commenced
but
he
was
apathetic
and
dilatory
he
had
known
summer
street
for
so
many
years
that
he
could
not
imagine
it
being
spoilt
not
till
flack
had
laid
the
foundation
stone
and
the
apparition
of
red
and
cream
brick
began
to
rise
did
he
take
alarm
he
called
on
flack
the
local
builder
a
most
reasonable
and
respectful
man
who
agreed
that
tiles
would
have
made
more
artistic
roof
but
pointed
out
that
slates
were
cheaper
he
ventured
to
differ
however
about
the
corinthian
columns
which
were
to
cling
like
leeches
to
the
frames
of
the
bow
windows
saying
that
for
his
part
he
liked
to
relieve
the
facade
by
a
bit
of
decoration
sir
harry
hinted
that
a
column
if
possible
should
be
structural
as
well
as
decorative
flack
replied
that
all
the
columns
had
been
ordered
adding
and
all
the
capitals
different
one
with
dragons
in
the
foliage
another
approaching
to
the
ionian
style
another
introducing
flack
s
initials
everyone
for
he
had
read
his
ruskin
he
built
his
villas
according
to
his
desire
and
not
until
he
had
inserted
an
immovable
aunt
into
one
of
them
did
sir
harry
buy
this
futile
and
unprofitable
transaction
filled
the
knight
with
sadness
as
he
leant
on
honeychurch
s
carriage
he
had
failed
in
his
duties
to
the
and
the
was
laughing
at
him
as
well
he
had
spent
money
and
yet
summer
street
was
spoilt
as
much
as
ever
all
he
could
do
now
was
to
find
a
desirable
tenant
for
cissie
some
one
really
desirable
the
rent
is
absurdly
low
he
told
them
and
perhaps
i
am
an
easy
landlord
but
it
is
such
an
awkward
size
it
is
too
large
for
the
peasant
class
and
too
small
for
any
one
the
least
like
cecil
had
been
hesitating
whether
he
should
despise
the
villas
or
despise
sir
harry
for
despising
them
the
latter
impulse
seemed
the
more
fruitful
you
ought
to
find
a
tenant
at
once
he
said
maliciously
it
would
be
a
perfect
paradise
for
a
bank
exactly
said
sir
harry
excitedly
that
is
exactly
what
i
fear
vyse
it
will
attract
the
wrong
type
of
people
the
train
service
has
improved
a
fatal
improvement
to
my
mind
and
what
are
five
miles
from
a
station
in
these
days
of
bicycles
rather
a
strenuous
clerk
it
would
be
said
lucy
cecil
who
had
his
full
share
of
mediaeval
mischievousness
replied
that
the
physique
of
the
lower
middle
classes
was
improving
at
a
most
appalling
rate
she
saw
that
he
was
laughing
at
their
harmless
neighbour
and
roused
herself
to
stop
him
sir
harry
she
exclaimed
i
have
an
idea
how
would
you
like
spinsters
my
dear
lucy
it
would
be
splendid
do
you
know
any
such
yes
i
met
them
gentlewomen
he
asked
tentatively
yes
indeed
and
at
the
present
moment
homeless
i
heard
from
them
last
week
miss
teresa
and
miss
catharine
alan
i
m
really
not
joking
they
are
quite
the
right
people
beebe
knows
them
too
may
i
tell
them
to
write
to
you
indeed
you
may
he
cried
here
we
are
with
the
difficulty
solved
already
how
delightful
it
is
extra
facilities
please
tell
them
they
shall
have
extra
facilities
for
i
shall
have
no
agents
fees
oh
the
agents
the
appalling
people
they
have
sent
me
one
woman
when
i
wrote
a
tactful
letter
you
know
asking
her
to
explain
her
social
position
to
me
replied
that
she
would
pay
the
rent
in
advance
as
if
one
cares
about
that
and
several
references
i
took
up
were
most
unsatisfactory
people
swindlers
or
not
respectable
and
oh
the
deceit
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
seamy
side
this
last
week
the
deceit
of
the
most
promising
people
my
dear
lucy
the
deceit
she
nodded
my
advice
put
in
honeychurch
is
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
lucy
and
her
decayed
gentlewomen
at
all
i
know
the
type
preserve
me
from
people
who
have
seen
better
days
and
bring
heirlooms
with
them
that
make
the
house
smell
stuffy
it
s
a
sad
thing
but
i
d
far
rather
let
to
someone
who
is
going
up
in
the
world
than
to
someone
who
has
come
i
think
i
follow
you
said
sir
harry
but
it
is
as
you
say
a
very
sad
the
misses
alan
aren
t
that
cried
lucy
yes
they
are
said
cecil
i
haven
t
met
them
but
i
should
say
they
were
a
highly
unsuitable
addition
to
the
don
t
listen
to
him
sir
harry
he
s
it
s
i
who
am
tiresome
he
replied
i
oughtn
t
to
come
with
my
troubles
to
young
people
but
really
i
am
so
worried
and
lady
otway
will
only
say
that
i
can
not
be
too
careful
which
is
quite
true
but
no
real
then
may
i
write
to
my
misses
alan
please
but
his
eye
wavered
when
honeychurch
exclaimed
beware
they
are
certain
to
have
canaries
sir
harry
beware
of
canaries
they
spit
the
seed
out
through
the
bars
of
the
cages
and
then
the
mice
come
beware
of
women
altogether
only
let
to
a
really
he
murmured
gallantly
though
he
saw
the
wisdom
of
her
remark
men
don
t
gossip
over
if
they
get
drunk
there
s
an
end
of
them
they
lie
down
comfortably
and
sleep
it
off
if
they
re
vulgar
they
somehow
keep
it
to
themselves
it
doesn
t
spread
so
give
me
a
man
of
course
provided
he
s
sir
harry
blushed
neither
he
nor
cecil
enjoyed
these
open
compliments
to
their
sex
even
the
exclusion
of
the
dirty
did
not
leave
them
much
distinction
he
suggested
that
honeychurch
if
she
had
time
should
descend
from
the
carriage
and
inspect
cissie
for
herself
she
was
delighted
nature
had
intended
her
to
be
poor
and
to
live
in
such
a
house
domestic
arrangements
always
attracted
her
especially
when
they
were
on
a
small
scale
cecil
pulled
lucy
back
as
she
followed
her
mother
mrs
honeychurch
he
said
what
if
we
two
walk
home
and
leave
you
certainly
was
her
cordial
reply
sir
harry
likewise
seemed
almost
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
he
beamed
at
them
knowingly
said
aha
young
people
young
people
and
then
hastened
to
unlock
the
house
hopeless
vulgarian
exclaimed
cecil
almost
before
they
were
out
of
earshot
oh
cecil
i
can
t
help
it
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
loathe
that
he
isn
t
clever
but
really
he
is
no
lucy
he
stands
for
all
that
is
bad
in
country
life
in
london
he
would
keep
his
place
he
would
belong
to
a
brainless
club
and
his
wife
would
give
brainless
dinner
parties
but
down
here
he
acts
the
little
god
with
his
gentility
and
his
patronage
and
his
sham
aesthetics
and
everyone
even
your
mother
is
taken
all
that
you
say
is
quite
true
said
lucy
though
she
felt
discouraged
i
wonder
whether
whether
it
matters
so
very
it
matters
supremely
sir
harry
is
the
essence
of
that
oh
goodness
how
cross
i
feel
how
i
do
hope
he
ll
get
some
vulgar
tenant
in
that
villa
some
woman
so
really
vulgar
that
he
ll
notice
it
gentlefolks
ugh
with
his
bald
head
and
retreating
chin
but
let
s
forget
this
lucy
was
glad
enough
to
do
if
cecil
disliked
sir
harry
otway
and
beebe
what
guarantee
was
there
that
the
people
who
really
mattered
to
her
would
escape
for
instance
freddy
freddy
was
neither
clever
nor
subtle
nor
beautiful
and
what
prevented
cecil
from
saying
any
minute
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
loathe
freddy
and
what
would
she
reply
further
than
freddy
she
did
not
go
but
he
gave
her
anxiety
enough
she
could
only
assure
herself
that
cecil
had
known
freddy
some
time
and
that
they
had
always
got
on
pleasantly
except
perhaps
during
the
last
few
days
which
was
an
accident
perhaps
which
way
shall
we
go
she
asked
him
nature
simplest
of
topics
she
thought
was
around
them
summer
street
lay
deep
in
the
woods
and
she
had
stopped
where
a
footpath
diverged
from
the
highroad
are
there
two
ways
perhaps
the
road
is
more
sensible
as
we
re
got
up
i
d
rather
go
through
the
wood
said
cecil
with
that
subdued
irritation
that
she
had
noticed
in
him
all
the
afternoon
why
is
it
lucy
that
you
always
say
the
road
do
you
know
that
you
have
never
once
been
with
me
in
the
fields
or
the
wood
since
we
were
engaged
haven
t
i
the
wood
then
said
lucy
startled
at
his
queerness
but
pretty
sure
that
he
would
explain
later
it
was
not
his
habit
to
leave
her
in
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
she
led
the
way
into
the
whispering
pines
and
sure
enough
he
did
explain
before
they
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
i
had
got
an
idea
i
dare
say
wrongly
that
you
feel
more
at
home
with
me
in
a
a
room
she
echoed
hopelessly
bewildered
yes
or
at
the
most
in
a
garden
or
on
a
road
never
in
the
real
country
like
oh
cecil
whatever
do
you
mean
i
have
never
felt
anything
of
the
sort
you
talk
as
if
i
was
a
kind
of
poetess
sort
of
i
don
t
know
that
you
aren
t
i
connect
you
with
a
view
a
certain
type
of
view
why
shouldn
t
you
connect
me
with
a
room
she
reflected
a
moment
and
then
said
laughing
do
you
know
that
you
re
right
i
do
i
must
be
a
poetess
after
all
when
i
think
of
you
it
s
always
as
in
a
room
how
funny
to
her
surprise
he
seemed
annoyed
a
pray
with
no
view
yes
with
no
view
i
fancy
why
not
i
d
rather
he
said
reproachfully
that
you
connected
me
with
the
open
she
said
again
oh
cecil
whatever
do
you
mean
as
no
explanation
was
forthcoming
she
shook
off
the
subject
as
too
difficult
for
a
girl
and
led
him
further
into
the
wood
pausing
every
now
and
then
at
some
particularly
beautiful
or
familiar
combination
of
the
trees
she
had
known
the
wood
between
summer
street
and
windy
corner
ever
since
she
could
walk
alone
she
had
played
at
losing
freddy
in
it
when
freddy
was
a
baby
and
though
she
had
been
to
italy
it
had
lost
none
of
its
charm
presently
they
came
to
a
little
clearing
among
the
pines
another
tiny
green
alp
solitary
this
time
and
holding
in
its
bosom
a
shallow
pool
she
exclaimed
the
sacred
lake
why
do
you
call
it
that
i
can
t
remember
why
i
suppose
it
comes
out
of
some
book
it
s
only
a
puddle
now
but
you
see
that
stream
going
through
it
well
a
good
deal
of
water
comes
down
after
heavy
rains
and
can
t
get
away
at
once
and
the
pool
becomes
quite
large
and
beautiful
then
freddy
used
to
bathe
there
he
is
very
fond
of
and
you
he
meant
are
you
fond
of
it
but
she
answered
dreamily
i
bathed
here
too
till
i
was
found
out
then
there
was
a
at
another
time
he
might
have
been
shocked
for
he
had
depths
of
prudishness
within
him
but
now
with
his
momentary
cult
of
the
fresh
air
he
was
delighted
at
her
admirable
simplicity
he
looked
at
her
as
she
stood
by
the
pool
s
edge
she
was
got
up
smart
as
she
phrased
it
and
she
reminded
him
of
some
brilliant
flower
that
has
no
leaves
of
its
own
but
blooms
abruptly
out
of
a
world
of
green
who
found
you
out
charlotte
she
murmured
she
was
stopping
with
us
charlotte
poor
girl
she
smiled
gravely
a
certain
scheme
from
which
hitherto
he
had
shrunk
now
appeared
practical
lucy
yes
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
going
was
her
reply
lucy
i
want
to
ask
something
of
you
that
i
have
never
asked
at
the
serious
note
in
his
voice
she
stepped
frankly
and
kindly
towards
him
what
cecil
hitherto
never
not
even
that
day
on
the
lawn
when
you
agreed
to
marry
me
he
became
and
kept
glancing
round
to
see
if
they
were
observed
his
courage
had
gone
yes
up
to
now
i
have
never
kissed
she
was
as
scarlet
as
if
he
had
put
the
thing
most
indelicately
no
more
you
have
she
stammered
then
i
ask
you
may
i
now
of
course
you
may
cecil
you
might
before
i
can
t
run
at
you
you
at
that
supreme
moment
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
absurdities
her
reply
was
inadequate
she
gave
such
a
lift
to
her
veil
as
he
approached
her
he
found
time
to
wish
that
he
could
recoil
as
he
touched
her
his
gold
became
dislodged
and
was
flattened
between
them
such
was
the
embrace
he
considered
with
truth
that
it
had
been
a
failure
passion
should
believe
itself
irresistible
it
should
forget
civility
and
consideration
and
all
the
other
curses
of
a
refined
nature
above
all
it
should
never
ask
for
leave
where
there
is
a
right
of
way
why
could
he
not
do
as
any
labourer
or
navvy
nay
as
any
young
man
behind
the
counter
would
have
done
he
recast
the
scene
lucy
was
standing
flowerlike
by
the
water
he
rushed
up
and
took
her
in
his
arms
she
rebuked
him
permitted
him
and
revered
him
ever
after
for
his
manliness
for
he
believed
that
women
revere
men
for
their
manliness
they
left
the
pool
in
silence
after
this
one
salutation
he
waited
for
her
to
make
some
remark
which
should
show
him
her
inmost
thoughts
at
last
she
spoke
and
with
fitting
gravity
emerson
was
the
name
not
what
name
the
old
man
what
old
man
that
old
man
i
told
you
about
the
one
mr
eager
was
so
unkind
he
could
not
know
that
this
was
the
most
intimate
conversation
they
had
ever
had
chapter
x
cecil
as
a
humourist
the
society
out
of
which
cecil
proposed
to
rescue
lucy
was
perhaps
no
very
splendid
affair
yet
it
was
more
splendid
than
her
antecedents
entitled
her
to
her
father
a
prosperous
local
solicitor
had
built
windy
corner
as
a
speculation
at
the
time
the
district
was
opening
up
and
falling
in
love
with
his
own
creation
had
ended
by
living
there
himself
soon
after
his
marriage
the
social
atmosphere
began
to
alter
other
houses
were
built
on
the
brow
of
that
steep
southern
slope
and
others
again
among
the
behind
and
northward
on
the
chalk
barrier
of
the
downs
most
of
these
houses
were
larger
than
windy
corner
and
were
filled
by
people
who
came
not
from
the
district
but
from
london
and
who
mistook
the
honeychurches
for
the
remnants
of
an
indigenous
aristocracy
he
was
inclined
to
be
frightened
but
his
wife
accepted
the
situation
without
either
pride
or
humility
i
can
not
think
what
people
are
doing
she
would
say
but
it
is
extremely
fortunate
for
the
she
called
everywhere
her
calls
were
returned
with
enthusiasm
and
by
the
time
people
found
out
that
she
was
not
exactly
of
their
milieu
they
liked
her
and
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
when
honeychurch
died
he
had
the
satisfaction
which
few
honest
solicitors
despise
of
leaving
his
family
rooted
in
the
best
society
obtainable
the
best
obtainable
certainly
many
of
the
immigrants
were
rather
dull
and
lucy
realized
this
more
vividly
since
her
return
from
italy
hitherto
she
had
accepted
their
ideals
without
questioning
their
kindly
affluence
their
inexplosive
religion
their
dislike
of
and
broken
bottles
a
radical
out
and
out
she
learnt
to
speak
with
horror
of
suburbia
life
so
far
as
she
troubled
to
conceive
it
was
a
circle
of
rich
pleasant
people
with
identical
interests
and
identical
foes
in
this
circle
one
thought
married
and
died
outside
it
were
poverty
and
vulgarity
for
ever
trying
to
enter
just
as
the
london
fog
tries
to
enter
the
pouring
through
the
gaps
in
the
northern
hills
but
in
italy
where
any
one
who
chooses
may
warm
himself
in
equality
as
in
the
sun
this
conception
of
life
vanished
her
senses
expanded
she
felt
that
there
was
no
one
whom
she
might
not
get
to
like
that
social
barriers
were
irremovable
doubtless
but
not
particularly
high
you
jump
over
them
just
as
you
jump
into
a
peasant
s
in
the
apennines
and
he
is
glad
to
see
you
she
returned
with
new
eyes
so
did
cecil
but
italy
had
quickened
cecil
not
to
tolerance
but
to
irritation
he
saw
that
the
local
society
was
narrow
but
instead
of
saying
does
that
very
much
matter
he
rebelled
and
tried
to
substitute
for
it
the
society
he
called
broad
he
did
not
realize
that
lucy
had
consecrated
her
environment
by
the
thousand
little
civilities
that
create
a
tenderness
in
time
and
that
though
her
eyes
saw
its
defects
her
heart
refused
to
despise
it
entirely
nor
did
he
realize
a
more
important
point
that
if
she
was
too
great
for
this
society
she
was
too
great
for
all
society
and
had
reached
the
stage
where
personal
intercourse
would
alone
satisfy
her
a
rebel
she
was
but
not
of
the
kind
he
understood
a
rebel
who
desired
not
a
wider
but
equality
beside
the
man
she
loved
for
italy
was
offering
her
the
most
priceless
of
all
possessions
her
own
soul
playing
with
minnie
beebe
niece
to
the
rector
and
aged
thirteen
an
ancient
and
most
honourable
game
which
consists
in
striking
high
into
the
air
so
that
they
fall
over
the
net
and
immoderately
bounce
some
hit
honeychurch
others
are
lost
the
sentence
is
confused
but
the
better
illustrates
lucy
s
state
of
mind
for
she
was
trying
to
talk
to
beebe
at
the
same
time
oh
it
has
been
such
a
nuisance
first
he
then
they
no
one
knowing
what
they
wanted
and
everyone
so
but
they
really
are
coming
now
said
beebe
i
wrote
to
miss
teresa
a
few
days
ago
she
was
wondering
how
often
the
butcher
called
and
my
reply
of
once
a
month
must
have
impressed
her
favourably
they
are
coming
i
heard
from
them
this
morning
i
shall
hate
those
miss
alans
honeychurch
cried
just
because
they
re
old
and
silly
one
s
expected
to
say
how
sweet
i
hate
their
if
and
but
and
and
and
poor
lucy
serve
her
right
worn
to
a
beebe
watched
the
shadow
springing
and
shouting
over
the
cecil
was
absent
one
did
not
play
when
he
was
there
well
if
they
are
coming
no
minnie
not
saturn
was
a
whose
skin
was
partially
unsewn
when
in
motion
his
orb
was
encircled
by
a
ring
if
they
are
coming
sir
harry
will
let
them
move
in
before
the
and
he
will
cross
out
the
clause
about
whitewashing
the
ceilings
because
it
made
them
nervous
and
put
in
the
fair
wear
and
tear
that
doesn
t
count
i
told
you
not
saturn
s
all
right
for
cried
freddy
joining
them
minnie
don
t
you
listen
to
saturn
doesn
t
saturn
bounces
no
he
doesn
well
he
bounces
better
than
the
beautiful
white
hush
dear
said
honeychurch
but
look
at
lucy
complaining
of
saturn
and
all
the
time
s
got
the
beautiful
white
devil
in
her
hand
ready
to
plug
it
in
that
s
right
minnie
go
for
her
get
her
over
the
shins
with
the
racquet
get
her
over
the
shins
lucy
fell
the
beautiful
white
devil
rolled
from
her
hand
beebe
picked
it
up
and
said
the
name
of
this
ball
is
vittoria
corombona
but
his
correction
passed
unheeded
freddy
possessed
to
a
high
degree
the
power
of
lashing
little
girls
to
fury
and
in
half
a
minute
he
had
transformed
minnie
from
a
child
into
a
howling
wilderness
up
in
the
house
cecil
heard
them
and
though
he
was
full
of
entertaining
news
he
did
not
come
down
to
impart
it
in
case
he
got
hurt
he
was
not
a
coward
and
bore
necessary
pain
as
well
as
any
man
but
he
hated
the
physical
violence
of
the
young
how
right
it
was
sure
enough
it
ended
in
a
cry
i
wish
the
miss
alans
could
see
this
observed
beebe
just
as
lucy
who
was
nursing
the
injured
minnie
was
in
turn
lifted
off
her
feet
by
her
brother
who
are
the
miss
alans
freddy
panted
they
have
taken
cissie
that
wasn
t
the
name
here
his
foot
slipped
and
they
all
fell
most
agreeably
on
to
the
grass
an
interval
elapses
wasn
t
what
name
asked
lucy
with
her
brother
s
head
in
her
lap
alan
wasn
t
the
name
of
the
people
sir
harry
s
let
nonsense
freddy
you
know
nothing
about
nonsense
yourself
i
ve
this
minute
seen
him
he
said
to
me
ahem
honeychurch
freddy
was
an
indifferent
mimic
ahem
ahem
i
have
at
last
procured
really
i
said
ooray
old
boy
and
slapped
him
on
the
exactly
the
miss
alans
rather
not
more
like
oh
good
gracious
there
isn
t
going
to
be
another
muddle
honeychurch
exclaimed
do
you
notice
lucy
i
m
always
right
i
said
don
t
interfere
with
cissie
villa
i
m
always
right
i
m
quite
uneasy
at
being
always
right
so
it
s
only
another
muddle
of
freddy
s
freddy
doesn
t
even
know
the
name
of
the
people
he
pretends
have
taken
it
yes
i
do
i
ve
got
it
what
name
emerson
i
ll
bet
you
anything
you
what
a
weathercock
sir
harry
is
said
lucy
quietly
i
wish
i
had
never
bothered
over
it
at
then
she
lay
on
her
back
and
gazed
at
the
cloudless
sky
beebe
whose
opinion
of
her
rose
daily
whispered
to
his
niece
that
that
was
the
proper
way
to
behave
if
any
little
thing
went
wrong
meanwhile
the
name
of
the
new
tenants
had
diverted
honeychurch
from
the
contemplation
of
her
own
abilities
emerson
freddy
do
you
know
what
emersons
they
are
i
don
t
know
whether
they
re
any
emersons
retorted
freddy
who
was
democratic
like
his
sister
and
like
most
young
people
he
was
naturally
attracted
by
the
idea
of
equality
and
the
undeniable
fact
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
emersons
annoyed
him
beyond
measure
i
trust
they
are
the
right
sort
of
person
all
right
lucy
she
was
sitting
up
again
i
see
you
looking
down
your
nose
and
thinking
your
mother
s
a
snob
but
there
is
a
right
sort
and
a
wrong
sort
and
it
s
affectation
to
pretend
there
isn
emerson
s
a
common
enough
name
lucy
remarked
she
was
gazing
sideways
seated
on
a
promontory
herself
she
could
see
the
promontories
descending
one
beyond
another
into
the
weald
the
further
one
descended
the
garden
the
more
glorious
was
this
lateral
view
i
was
merely
going
to
remark
freddy
that
i
trusted
they
were
no
relations
of
emerson
the
philosopher
a
most
trying
man
pray
does
that
satisfy
you
oh
yes
he
grumbled
and
you
will
be
satisfied
too
for
they
re
friends
of
cecil
so
elaborate
irony
you
and
the
other
country
families
will
be
able
to
call
in
perfect
cecil
exclaimed
lucy
don
t
be
rude
dear
said
his
mother
placidly
lucy
don
t
screech
it
s
a
new
bad
habit
you
re
getting
but
has
cecil
friends
of
cecil
s
he
repeated
and
so
really
ahem
honeychurch
i
have
just
telegraphed
to
she
got
up
from
the
grass
it
was
hard
on
lucy
beebe
sympathized
with
her
very
much
while
she
believed
that
her
snub
about
the
miss
alans
came
from
sir
harry
otway
she
had
borne
it
like
a
good
girl
she
might
well
screech
when
she
heard
that
it
came
partly
from
her
lover
vyse
was
a
tease
something
worse
than
a
tease
he
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
thwarting
people
the
clergyman
knowing
this
looked
at
miss
honeychurch
with
more
than
his
usual
kindness
when
she
exclaimed
but
cecil
s
emersons
they
can
t
possibly
be
the
same
ones
there
is
that
he
did
not
consider
that
the
exclamation
was
strange
but
saw
in
it
an
opportunity
of
diverting
the
conversation
while
she
recovered
her
composure
he
diverted
it
as
follows
the
emersons
who
were
at
florence
do
you
mean
no
i
don
t
suppose
it
will
prove
to
be
them
it
is
probably
a
long
cry
from
them
to
friends
of
vyse
s
oh
honeychurch
the
oddest
people
the
queerest
people
for
our
part
we
liked
them
didn
t
we
he
appealed
to
lucy
there
was
a
great
scene
over
some
violets
they
picked
violets
and
filled
all
the
vases
in
the
room
of
these
very
miss
alans
who
have
failed
to
come
to
cissie
villa
poor
little
ladies
so
shocked
and
so
pleased
it
used
to
be
one
of
miss
catharine
s
great
stories
my
dear
sister
loves
flowers
it
began
they
found
the
whole
room
a
mass
of
blue
vases
and
jugs
and
the
story
ends
with
so
ungentlemanly
and
yet
so
it
is
all
very
difficult
yes
i
always
connect
those
florentine
emersons
with
fiasco
s
done
you
this
time
remarked
freddy
not
seeing
that
his
sister
s
face
was
very
red
she
could
not
recover
herself
beebe
saw
it
and
continued
to
divert
the
conversation
these
particular
emersons
consisted
of
a
father
and
a
son
the
son
a
goodly
if
not
a
good
young
man
not
a
fool
i
fancy
but
very
immature
pessimism
et
cetera
our
special
joy
was
the
father
such
a
sentimental
darling
and
people
declared
he
had
murdered
his
in
his
normal
state
beebe
would
never
have
repeated
such
gossip
but
he
was
trying
to
shelter
lucy
in
her
little
trouble
he
repeated
any
rubbish
that
came
into
his
head
murdered
his
wife
said
honeychurch
lucy
don
t
desert
us
go
on
playing
really
the
pension
bertolini
must
have
been
the
oddest
place
that
s
the
second
murderer
i
ve
heard
of
as
being
there
whatever
was
charlotte
doing
to
stop
we
really
must
ask
charlotte
here
some
beebe
could
recall
no
second
murderer
he
suggested
that
his
hostess
was
mistaken
at
the
hint
of
opposition
she
warmed
she
was
perfectly
sure
that
there
had
been
a
second
tourist
of
whom
the
same
story
had
been
told
the
name
escaped
her
what
was
the
name
oh
what
was
the
name
she
clasped
her
knees
for
the
name
something
in
thackeray
she
struck
her
matronly
forehead
lucy
asked
her
brother
whether
cecil
was
in
oh
don
t
go
he
cried
and
tried
to
catch
her
by
the
ankles
i
must
go
she
said
gravely
don
t
be
silly
you
always
overdo
it
when
you
as
she
left
them
her
mother
s
shout
of
harris
shivered
the
tranquil
air
and
reminded
her
that
she
had
told
a
lie
and
had
never
put
it
right
such
a
senseless
lie
too
yet
it
shattered
her
nerves
and
made
her
connect
these
emersons
friends
of
cecil
s
with
a
pair
of
nondescript
tourists
hitherto
truth
had
come
to
her
naturally
she
saw
that
for
the
future
she
must
be
more
vigilant
and
be
absolutely
truthful
well
at
all
events
she
must
not
tell
lies
she
hurried
up
the
garden
still
flushed
with
shame
a
word
from
cecil
would
soothe
her
she
was
sure
cecil
hullo
he
called
and
leant
out
of
the
window
he
seemed
in
high
spirits
i
was
hoping
you
d
come
i
heard
you
all
but
there
s
better
fun
up
here
i
even
i
have
won
a
great
victory
for
the
comic
muse
george
meredith
s
right
the
cause
of
comedy
and
the
cause
of
truth
are
really
the
same
and
i
even
i
have
found
tenants
for
the
distressful
cissie
villa
don
t
be
angry
don
t
be
angry
you
ll
forgive
me
when
you
hear
it
he
looked
very
attractive
when
his
face
was
bright
and
he
dispelled
her
ridiculous
forebodings
at
once
i
have
heard
she
said
freddy
has
told
us
naughty
cecil
i
suppose
i
must
forgive
you
just
think
of
all
the
trouble
i
took
for
nothing
certainly
the
miss
alans
are
a
little
tiresome
and
i
d
rather
have
nice
friends
of
yours
but
you
oughtn
t
to
tease
one
friends
of
mine
he
laughed
but
lucy
the
whole
joke
is
to
come
come
but
she
remained
standing
where
she
was
do
you
know
where
i
met
these
desirable
tenants
in
the
national
gallery
when
i
was
up
to
see
my
mother
last
what
an
odd
place
to
meet
people
she
said
nervously
i
don
t
quite
in
the
umbrian
room
absolute
strangers
they
were
admiring
luca
signorelli
of
course
quite
stupidly
however
we
got
talking
and
they
refreshed
me
not
a
little
they
had
been
to
but
cecil
proceeded
hilariously
in
the
course
of
conversation
they
said
that
they
wanted
a
country
cottage
the
father
to
live
there
the
son
to
run
down
for
i
thought
what
a
chance
of
scoring
off
sir
harry
and
i
took
their
address
and
a
london
reference
found
they
weren
t
actual
blackguards
it
was
great
sport
and
wrote
to
him
making
out
cecil
no
it
s
not
fair
i
ve
probably
met
them
before
he
bore
her
down
perfectly
fair
anything
is
fair
that
punishes
a
snob
that
old
man
will
do
the
neighbourhood
a
world
of
good
sir
harry
is
too
disgusting
with
his
decayed
i
meant
to
read
him
a
lesson
some
time
no
lucy
the
classes
ought
to
mix
and
before
long
you
ll
agree
with
me
there
ought
to
be
intermarriage
all
sorts
of
things
i
believe
in
democracy
no
you
don
t
she
snapped
you
don
t
know
what
the
word
he
stared
at
her
and
felt
again
that
she
had
failed
to
be
leonardesque
no
you
don
t
her
face
was
inartistic
that
of
a
peevish
virago
it
isn
t
fair
cecil
i
blame
you
i
blame
you
very
much
indeed
you
had
no
business
to
undo
my
work
about
the
miss
alans
and
make
me
look
ridiculous
you
call
it
scoring
off
sir
harry
but
do
you
realize
that
it
is
all
at
my
expense
i
consider
it
most
disloyal
of
she
left
him
temper
he
thought
raising
his
eyebrows
no
it
was
worse
than
temper
snobbishness
as
long
as
lucy
thought
that
his
own
smart
friends
were
supplanting
the
miss
alans
she
had
not
minded
he
perceived
that
these
new
tenants
might
be
of
value
educationally
he
would
tolerate
the
father
and
draw
out
the
son
who
was
silent
in
the
interests
of
the
comic
muse
and
of
truth
he
would
bring
them
to
windy
corner
chapter
xi
in
vyse
s
flat
the
comic
muse
though
able
to
look
after
her
own
interests
did
not
disdain
the
assistance
of
vyse
his
idea
of
bringing
the
emersons
to
windy
corner
struck
her
as
decidedly
good
and
she
carried
through
the
negotiations
without
a
hitch
sir
harry
otway
signed
the
agreement
met
emerson
who
was
duly
disillusioned
the
miss
alans
were
duly
offended
and
wrote
a
dignified
letter
to
lucy
whom
they
held
responsible
for
the
failure
beebe
planned
pleasant
moments
for
the
and
told
honeychurch
that
freddy
must
call
on
them
as
soon
as
they
arrived
indeed
so
ample
was
the
muse
s
equipment
that
she
permitted
harris
never
a
very
robust
criminal
to
droop
his
head
to
be
forgotten
and
to
die
lucy
to
descend
from
bright
heaven
to
earth
whereon
there
are
shadows
because
there
are
hills
lucy
was
at
first
plunged
into
despair
but
settled
after
a
little
thought
that
it
did
not
matter
the
very
least
now
that
she
was
engaged
the
emersons
would
scarcely
insult
her
and
were
welcome
into
the
neighbourhood
and
cecil
was
welcome
to
bring
whom
he
would
into
the
neighbourhood
therefore
cecil
was
welcome
to
bring
the
emersons
into
the
neighbourhood
but
as
i
say
this
took
a
little
thinking
and
so
illogical
are
girls
the
event
remained
rather
greater
and
rather
more
dreadful
than
it
should
have
done
she
was
glad
that
a
visit
to
vyse
now
fell
due
the
tenants
moved
into
cissie
villa
while
she
was
safe
in
the
london
flat
cecil
cecil
darling
she
whispered
the
evening
she
arrived
and
crept
into
his
arms
cecil
too
became
demonstrative
he
saw
that
the
needful
fire
had
been
kindled
in
lucy
at
last
she
longed
for
attention
as
a
woman
should
and
looked
up
to
him
because
he
was
a
man
so
you
do
love
me
little
thing
he
murmured
oh
cecil
i
do
i
do
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
without
several
days
passed
then
she
had
a
letter
from
miss
bartlett
a
coolness
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
cousins
and
they
had
not
corresponded
since
they
parted
in
august
the
coolness
dated
from
what
charlotte
would
call
the
flight
to
rome
and
in
rome
it
had
increased
amazingly
for
the
companion
who
is
merely
uncongenial
in
the
mediaeval
world
becomes
exasperating
in
the
classical
charlotte
unselfish
in
the
forum
would
have
tried
a
sweeter
temper
than
lucy
s
and
once
in
the
baths
of
caracalla
they
had
doubted
whether
they
could
continue
their
tour
lucy
had
said
she
would
join
the
vyses
vyse
was
an
acquaintance
of
her
mother
so
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
plan
and
miss
bartlett
had
replied
that
she
was
quite
used
to
being
abandoned
suddenly
finally
nothing
happened
but
the
coolness
remained
and
for
lucy
was
even
increased
when
she
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
it
had
been
forwarded
from
windy
corner
tunbridge
wells
september
dearest
lucia
i
have
news
of
you
at
last
miss
lavish
has
been
bicycling
in
your
parts
but
was
not
sure
whether
a
call
would
be
welcome
puncturing
her
tire
near
summer
street
and
it
being
mended
while
she
sat
very
woebegone
in
that
pretty
churchyard
she
saw
to
her
astonishment
a
door
open
opposite
and
the
younger
emerson
man
come
out
he
said
his
father
had
just
taken
the
house
he
said
he
did
not
know
that
you
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
he
never
suggested
giving
eleanor
a
cup
of
tea
dear
lucy
i
am
much
worried
and
i
advise
you
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
his
past
behaviour
to
your
mother
freddy
and
vyse
who
will
forbid
him
to
enter
the
house
etc
that
was
a
great
misfortune
and
i
dare
say
you
have
told
them
already
vyse
is
so
sensitive
i
remember
how
i
used
to
get
on
his
nerves
at
rome
i
am
very
sorry
about
it
all
and
should
not
feel
easy
unless
i
warned
you
believe
me
your
anxious
and
loving
cousin
lucy
was
much
annoyed
and
replied
as
follows
beauchamp
mansions
dear
charlotte
many
thanks
for
your
warning
when
emerson
forgot
himself
on
the
mountain
you
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
mother
because
you
said
she
would
blame
you
for
not
being
always
with
me
i
have
kept
that
promise
and
can
not
possibly
tell
her
now
i
have
said
both
to
her
and
cecil
that
i
met
the
emersons
at
florence
and
that
they
are
respectable
people
which
i
do
think
and
the
reason
that
he
offered
miss
lavish
no
tea
was
probably
that
he
had
none
himself
she
should
have
tried
at
the
rectory
i
can
not
begin
making
a
fuss
at
this
stage
you
must
see
that
it
would
be
too
absurd
if
the
emersons
heard
i
had
complained
of
them
they
would
think
themselves
of
importance
which
is
exactly
what
they
are
not
i
like
the
old
father
and
look
forward
to
seeing
him
again
as
for
the
son
i
am
sorry
for
him
when
we
meet
rather
than
for
myself
they
are
known
to
cecil
who
is
very
well
and
spoke
of
you
the
other
day
we
expect
to
be
married
in
january
miss
lavish
can
not
have
told
you
much
about
me
for
i
am
not
at
windy
corner
at
all
but
here
please
do
not
put
private
outside
your
envelope
again
no
one
opens
my
letters
yours
affectionately
l
secrecy
has
this
disadvantage
we
lose
the
sense
of
proportion
we
can
not
tell
whether
our
secret
is
important
or
not
were
lucy
and
her
cousin
closeted
with
a
great
thing
which
would
destroy
cecil
s
life
if
he
discovered
it
or
with
a
little
thing
which
he
would
laugh
at
miss
bartlett
suggested
the
former
perhaps
she
was
right
it
had
become
a
great
thing
now
left
to
herself
lucy
would
have
told
her
mother
and
her
lover
ingenuously
and
it
would
have
remained
a
little
thing
emerson
not
harris
it
was
only
that
a
few
weeks
ago
she
tried
to
tell
cecil
even
now
when
they
were
laughing
about
some
beautiful
lady
who
had
smitten
his
heart
at
school
but
her
body
behaved
so
ridiculously
that
she
stopped
she
and
her
secret
stayed
ten
days
longer
in
the
deserted
metropolis
visiting
the
scenes
they
were
to
know
so
well
later
on
it
did
her
no
harm
cecil
thought
to
learn
the
framework
of
society
while
society
itself
was
absent
on
the
or
the
moors
the
weather
was
cool
and
it
did
her
no
harm
in
spite
of
the
season
vyse
managed
to
scrape
together
a
consisting
entirely
of
the
grandchildren
of
famous
people
the
food
was
poor
but
the
talk
had
a
witty
weariness
that
impressed
the
girl
one
was
tired
of
everything
it
seemed
one
launched
into
enthusiasms
only
to
collapse
gracefully
and
pick
oneself
up
amid
sympathetic
laughter
in
this
atmosphere
the
pension
bertolini
and
windy
corner
appeared
equally
crude
and
lucy
saw
that
her
london
career
would
estrange
her
a
little
from
all
that
she
had
loved
in
the
past
the
grandchildren
asked
her
to
play
the
piano
she
played
schumann
now
some
beethoven
called
cecil
when
the
querulous
beauty
of
the
music
had
died
she
shook
her
head
and
played
schumann
again
the
melody
rose
unprofitably
magical
it
broke
it
was
resumed
broken
not
marching
once
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
the
sadness
of
the
incomplete
the
sadness
that
is
often
life
but
should
never
be
art
throbbed
in
its
disjected
phrases
and
made
the
nerves
of
the
audience
throb
not
thus
had
she
played
on
the
little
draped
piano
at
the
bertolini
and
too
much
schumann
was
not
the
remark
that
beebe
had
passed
to
himself
when
she
returned
when
the
guests
were
gone
and
lucy
had
gone
to
bed
vyse
paced
up
and
down
the
discussing
her
little
party
with
her
son
vyse
was
a
nice
woman
but
her
personality
like
many
another
s
had
been
swamped
by
london
for
it
needs
a
strong
head
to
live
among
many
people
the
too
vast
orb
of
her
fate
had
crushed
her
and
she
had
seen
too
many
seasons
too
many
cities
too
many
men
for
her
abilities
and
even
with
cecil
she
was
mechanical
and
behaved
as
if
he
was
not
one
son
but
so
to
speak
a
filial
crowd
make
lucy
one
of
us
she
said
looking
round
intelligently
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
and
straining
her
lips
apart
until
she
spoke
again
lucy
is
becoming
wonderful
her
music
always
was
yes
but
she
is
purging
off
the
honeychurch
taint
most
excellent
honeychurches
but
you
know
what
i
mean
she
is
not
always
quoting
servants
or
asking
one
how
the
pudding
is
italy
has
done
perhaps
she
murmured
thinking
of
the
museum
that
represented
italy
to
her
it
is
just
possible
cecil
mind
you
marry
her
next
january
she
is
one
of
us
but
her
music
he
exclaimed
the
style
of
her
how
she
kept
to
schumann
when
like
an
idiot
i
wanted
beethoven
schumann
was
right
for
this
evening
schumann
was
the
thing
do
you
know
mother
i
shall
have
our
children
educated
just
like
lucy
bring
them
up
among
honest
country
folks
for
freshness
send
them
to
italy
for
subtlety
and
then
not
till
then
let
them
come
to
london
i
don
t
believe
in
these
london
educations
he
broke
off
remembering
that
he
had
had
one
himself
and
concluded
at
all
events
not
for
make
her
one
of
us
repeated
vyse
and
processed
to
bed
as
she
was
dozing
off
a
cry
the
cry
of
nightmare
rang
from
lucy
s
room
lucy
could
ring
for
the
maid
if
she
liked
but
vyse
thought
it
kind
to
go
herself
she
found
the
girl
sitting
upright
with
her
hand
on
her
cheek
i
am
so
sorry
vyse
it
is
these
bad
dreams
just
the
elder
lady
smiled
and
kissed
her
saying
very
distinctly
you
should
have
heard
us
talking
about
you
dear
he
admires
you
more
than
ever
dream
of
lucy
returned
the
kiss
still
covering
one
cheek
with
her
hand
vyse
recessed
to
bed
cecil
whom
the
cry
had
not
awoke
snored
darkness
enveloped
the
flat
chapter
xii
twelfth
chapter
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon
gay
and
brilliant
after
abundant
rains
and
the
spirit
of
youth
dwelt
in
it
though
the
season
was
now
autumn
all
that
was
gracious
triumphed
as
the
motorcars
passed
through
summer
street
they
raised
only
a
little
dust
and
their
stench
was
soon
dispersed
by
the
wind
and
replaced
by
the
scent
of
the
wet
birches
or
of
the
pines
beebe
at
leisure
for
life
s
amenities
leant
over
his
rectory
gate
freddy
leant
by
him
smoking
a
pendant
pipe
suppose
we
go
and
hinder
those
new
people
opposite
for
a
m
they
might
amuse
freddy
whom
his
never
amused
suggested
that
the
new
people
might
be
feeling
a
bit
busy
and
so
on
since
they
had
only
just
moved
in
i
suggested
we
should
hinder
them
said
beebe
they
are
worth
unlatching
the
gate
he
sauntered
over
the
triangular
green
to
cissie
villa
hullo
he
cried
shouting
in
at
the
open
door
through
which
much
squalor
was
visible
a
grave
voice
replied
hullo
i
ve
brought
someone
to
see
i
ll
be
down
in
a
the
passage
was
blocked
by
a
wardrobe
which
the
removal
men
had
failed
to
carry
up
the
stairs
beebe
edged
round
it
with
difficulty
the
itself
was
blocked
with
books
are
these
people
great
readers
freddy
whispered
are
they
that
sort
i
fancy
they
know
how
to
read
a
rare
accomplishment
what
have
they
got
byron
exactly
a
shropshire
lad
never
heard
of
it
the
way
of
all
flesh
never
heard
of
it
gibbon
hullo
dear
george
reads
german
um
um
schopenhauer
nietzsche
and
so
we
go
on
well
i
suppose
your
generation
knows
its
own
business
mr
beebe
look
at
that
said
freddy
in
awestruck
tones
on
the
cornice
of
the
wardrobe
the
hand
of
an
amateur
had
painted
this
inscription
mistrust
all
enterprises
that
require
new
i
know
isn
t
it
jolly
i
like
that
i
m
certain
that
s
the
old
man
s
how
very
odd
of
him
surely
you
agree
but
freddy
was
his
mother
s
son
and
felt
that
one
ought
not
to
go
on
spoiling
the
furniture
pictures
the
clergyman
continued
scrambling
about
the
room
giotto
they
got
that
at
florence
i
ll
be
the
same
as
lucy
s
oh
did
miss
honeychurch
enjoy
london
she
came
back
i
suppose
she
had
a
good
time
yes
very
said
freddy
taking
up
a
book
she
and
cecil
are
thicker
than
that
s
good
i
wish
i
wasn
t
such
a
fool
beebe
ignored
the
remark
lucy
used
to
be
nearly
as
stupid
as
i
am
but
it
ll
be
very
different
now
mother
thinks
she
will
read
all
kinds
of
so
will
only
medical
books
not
books
that
you
can
talk
about
afterwards
cecil
is
teaching
lucy
italian
and
he
says
her
playing
is
wonderful
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
in
it
that
we
have
never
noticed
cecil
says
what
on
earth
are
those
people
doing
upstairs
emerson
we
think
we
ll
come
another
george
ran
and
pushed
them
into
the
room
without
speaking
let
me
introduce
honeychurch
a
then
freddy
hurled
one
of
the
thunderbolts
of
youth
perhaps
he
was
shy
perhaps
he
was
friendly
or
perhaps
he
thought
that
george
s
face
wanted
washing
at
all
events
he
greeted
him
with
how
d
ye
do
come
and
have
a
oh
all
right
said
george
impassive
beebe
was
highly
entertained
how
d
ye
do
how
d
ye
do
come
and
have
a
bathe
he
chuckled
that
s
the
best
conversational
opening
i
ve
ever
heard
but
i
m
afraid
it
will
only
act
between
men
can
you
picture
a
lady
who
has
been
introduced
to
another
lady
by
a
third
lady
opening
civilities
with
how
do
you
do
come
and
have
a
bathe
and
yet
you
will
tell
me
that
the
sexes
are
i
tell
you
that
they
shall
be
said
emerson
who
had
been
slowly
descending
the
stairs
good
afternoon
beebe
i
tell
you
they
shall
be
comrades
and
george
thinks
the
we
are
to
raise
ladies
to
our
level
the
clergyman
inquired
the
garden
of
eden
pursued
emerson
still
descending
which
you
place
in
the
past
is
really
yet
to
come
we
shall
enter
it
when
we
no
longer
despise
our
beebe
disclaimed
placing
the
garden
of
eden
anywhere
in
this
not
in
other
things
we
men
are
ahead
we
despise
the
body
less
than
women
do
but
not
until
we
are
comrades
shall
we
enter
the
i
say
what
about
this
bathe
murmured
freddy
appalled
at
the
mass
of
philosophy
that
was
approaching
him
i
believed
in
a
return
to
nature
once
but
how
can
we
return
to
nature
when
we
have
never
been
with
her
i
believe
that
we
must
discover
nature
after
many
conquests
we
shall
attain
simplicity
it
is
our
let
me
introduce
honeychurch
whose
sister
you
will
remember
at
how
do
you
do
very
glad
to
see
you
and
that
you
are
taking
george
for
a
bathe
very
glad
to
hear
that
your
sister
is
going
to
marry
marriage
is
a
duty
i
am
sure
that
she
will
be
happy
for
we
know
vyse
too
he
has
been
most
kind
he
met
us
by
chance
in
the
national
gallery
and
arranged
everything
about
this
delightful
house
though
i
hope
i
have
not
vexed
sir
harry
otway
i
have
met
so
few
liberal
landowners
and
i
was
anxious
to
compare
his
attitude
towards
the
game
laws
with
the
conservative
attitude
ah
this
wind
you
do
well
to
bathe
yours
is
a
glorious
country
honeychurch
not
a
bit
mumbled
freddy
i
must
that
is
to
say
i
have
to
have
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
you
later
on
my
mother
says
i
call
my
lad
who
taught
us
that
twaddle
call
on
your
grandmother
listen
to
the
wind
among
the
pines
yours
is
a
glorious
beebe
came
to
the
rescue
mr
emerson
he
will
call
i
shall
call
you
or
your
son
will
return
our
calls
before
ten
days
have
elapsed
i
trust
that
you
have
realized
about
the
ten
days
interval
it
does
not
count
that
i
helped
you
with
the
yesterday
it
does
not
count
that
they
are
going
to
bathe
this
yes
go
and
bathe
george
why
do
you
dawdle
talking
bring
them
back
to
tea
bring
back
some
milk
cakes
honey
the
change
will
do
you
good
george
has
been
working
very
hard
at
his
office
i
can
t
believe
he
s
george
bowed
his
head
dusty
and
sombre
exhaling
the
peculiar
smell
of
one
who
has
handled
furniture
do
you
really
want
this
bathe
freddy
asked
him
it
is
only
a
pond
don
t
you
know
i
dare
say
you
are
used
to
something
yes
i
have
said
yes
beebe
felt
bound
to
assist
his
young
friend
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
how
glorious
it
was
for
a
little
time
the
voice
of
old
emerson
pursued
them
dispensing
good
wishes
and
philosophy
it
ceased
and
they
only
heard
the
fair
wind
blowing
the
bracken
and
the
trees
beebe
who
could
be
silent
but
who
could
not
bear
silence
was
compelled
to
chatter
since
the
expedition
looked
like
a
failure
and
neither
of
his
companions
would
utter
a
word
he
spoke
of
florence
george
attended
gravely
assenting
or
dissenting
with
slight
but
determined
gestures
that
were
as
inexplicable
as
the
motions
of
the
above
their
heads
and
what
a
coincidence
that
you
should
meet
vyse
did
you
realize
that
you
would
find
all
the
pension
bertolini
down
here
i
did
not
miss
lavish
told
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
always
meant
to
write
a
history
of
no
enthusiasm
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
coincidences
are
much
rarer
than
we
suppose
for
example
it
isn
t
purely
coincidentally
that
you
are
here
now
when
one
comes
to
to
his
relief
george
began
to
talk
it
is
i
have
reflected
it
is
fate
everything
is
fate
we
are
flung
together
by
fate
drawn
apart
by
fate
flung
together
drawn
apart
the
twelve
winds
blow
us
we
settle
nothing
you
have
not
reflected
at
all
rapped
the
clergyman
let
me
give
you
a
useful
tip
emerson
attribute
nothing
to
fate
don
t
say
i
didn
t
do
this
for
you
did
it
ten
to
one
now
i
ll
you
where
did
you
first
meet
miss
honeychurch
and
myself
and
where
did
you
meet
vyse
who
is
going
to
marry
miss
honeychurch
national
looking
at
italian
art
there
you
are
and
yet
you
talk
of
coincidence
and
fate
you
naturally
seek
out
things
italian
and
so
do
we
and
our
friends
this
narrows
the
field
immeasurably
we
meet
again
in
it
is
fate
that
i
am
here
persisted
george
but
you
can
call
it
italy
if
it
makes
you
less
beebe
slid
away
from
such
heavy
treatment
of
the
subject
but
he
was
infinitely
tolerant
of
the
young
and
had
no
desire
to
snub
george
and
so
for
this
and
for
other
reasons
my
history
of
coincidence
is
still
to
silence
wishing
to
round
off
the
episode
he
added
we
are
all
so
glad
that
you
have
silence
here
we
are
called
freddy
oh
good
exclaimed
beebe
mopping
his
brow
in
there
s
the
pond
i
wish
it
was
bigger
he
added
apologetically
they
climbed
down
a
slippery
bank
of
there
lay
the
pond
set
in
its
little
alp
of
green
only
a
pond
but
large
enough
to
contain
the
human
body
and
pure
enough
to
reflect
the
sky
on
account
of
the
rains
the
waters
had
flooded
the
surrounding
grass
which
showed
like
a
beautiful
emerald
path
tempting
these
feet
towards
the
central
pool
it
s
distinctly
successful
as
ponds
go
said
beebe
no
apologies
are
necessary
for
the
george
sat
down
where
the
ground
was
dry
and
drearily
unlaced
his
boots
aren
t
those
masses
of
splendid
i
love
in
seed
what
s
the
name
of
this
aromatic
plant
no
one
knew
or
seemed
to
care
these
abrupt
changes
of
vegetation
this
little
spongeous
tract
of
water
plants
and
on
either
side
of
it
all
the
growths
are
tough
or
brittle
heather

pines
very
charming
very
mr
beebe
aren
t
you
bathing
called
freddy
as
he
stripped
himself
beebe
thought
he
was
not
water
s
wonderful
cried
freddy
prancing
in
water
s
water
murmured
george
wetting
his
hair
first
a
sure
sign
of
apathy
he
followed
freddy
into
the
divine
as
indifferent
as
if
he
were
a
statue
and
the
pond
a
pail
of
soapsuds
it
was
necessary
to
use
his
muscles
it
was
necessary
to
keep
clean
beebe
watched
them
and
watched
the
seeds
of
the
dance
chorically
above
their
heads
apooshoo
apooshoo
apooshoo
went
freddy
swimming
for
two
strokes
in
either
direction
and
then
becoming
involved
in
reeds
or
mud
is
it
worth
it
asked
the
other
michelangelesque
on
the
flooded
margin
the
bank
broke
away
and
he
fell
into
the
pool
before
he
had
weighed
the
question
properly
i
ve
swallowed
a
pollywog
beebe
water
s
wonderful
water
s
simply
water
s
not
so
bad
said
george
reappearing
from
his
plunge
and
sputtering
at
the
sun
water
s
wonderful
beebe
apooshoo
beebe
who
was
hot
and
who
always
acquiesced
where
possible
looked
around
him
he
could
detect
no
parishioners
except
the
rising
up
steeply
on
all
sides
and
gesturing
to
each
other
against
the
blue
how
glorious
it
was
the
world
of
and
rural
deans
receded
inimitably
water
sky
evergreens
a
wind
these
things
not
even
the
seasons
can
touch
and
surely
they
lie
beyond
the
intrusion
of
man
i
may
as
well
wash
too
and
soon
his
garments
made
a
third
little
pile
on
the
sward
and
he
too
asserted
the
wonder
of
the
water
it
was
ordinary
water
nor
was
there
very
much
of
it
and
as
freddy
said
it
reminded
one
of
swimming
in
a
salad
the
three
gentlemen
rotated
in
the
pool
breast
high
after
the
fashion
of
the
nymphs
in
gotterdammerung
but
either
because
the
rains
had
given
a
freshness
or
because
the
sun
was
shedding
a
most
glorious
heat
or
because
two
of
the
gentlemen
were
young
in
years
and
the
third
young
in
spirit
for
some
reason
or
other
a
change
came
over
them
and
they
forgot
italy
and
botany
and
fate
they
began
to
play
beebe
and
freddy
splashed
each
other
a
little
deferentially
they
splashed
george
he
was
quiet
they
feared
they
had
offended
him
then
all
the
forces
of
youth
burst
out
he
smiled
flung
himself
at
them
splashed
them
ducked
them
kicked
them
muddied
them
and
drove
them
out
of
the
pool
race
you
round
it
then
cried
freddy
and
they
raced
in
the
sunshine
and
george
took
a
short
cut
and
dirtied
his
shins
and
had
to
bathe
a
second
time
then
beebe
consented
to
run
a
memorable
sight
they
ran
to
get
dry
they
bathed
to
get
cool
they
played
at
being
indians
in
the
and
in
the
bracken
they
bathed
to
get
clean
and
all
the
time
three
little
bundles
lay
discreetly
on
the
sward
proclaiming
no
we
are
what
matters
without
us
shall
no
enterprise
begin
to
us
shall
all
flesh
turn
in
the
a
try
a
try
yelled
freddy
snatching
up
george
s
bundle
and
placing
it
beside
an
imaginary
socker
rules
george
retorted
scattering
freddy
s
bundle
with
a
kick
goal
goal
pass
take
care
my
watch
cried
beebe
clothes
flew
in
all
directions
take
care
my
hat
no
that
s
enough
freddy
dress
now
no
i
say
but
the
two
young
men
were
delirious
away
they
twinkled
into
the
trees
freddy
with
a
clerical
waistcoat
under
his
arm
george
with
a
hat
on
his
dripping
hair
that
ll
do
shouted
beebe
remembering
that
after
all
he
was
in
his
own
parish
then
his
voice
changed
as
if
every
was
a
rural
dean
hi
steady
on
i
see
people
coming
you
fellows
yells
and
widening
circles
over
the
dappled
earth
hi
hi
ladies
neither
george
nor
freddy
was
truly
refined
still
they
did
not
hear
beebe
s
last
warning
or
they
would
have
avoided
honeychurch
cecil
and
lucy
who
were
walking
down
to
call
on
old
butterworth
freddy
dropped
the
waistcoat
at
their
feet
and
dashed
into
some
bracken
george
whooped
in
their
faces
turned
and
scudded
away
down
the
path
to
the
pond
still
clad
in
beebe
s
hat
gracious
alive
cried
honeychurch
whoever
were
those
unfortunate
people
oh
dears
look
away
and
poor
beebe
too
whatever
has
happened
come
this
way
immediately
commanded
cecil
who
always
felt
that
he
must
lead
women
though
he
knew
not
whither
and
protect
them
though
he
knew
not
against
what
he
led
them
now
towards
the
bracken
where
freddy
sat
concealed
oh
poor
beebe
was
that
his
waistcoat
we
left
in
the
path
cecil
beebe
s
waistcoat
no
business
of
ours
said
cecil
glancing
at
lucy
who
was
all
parasol
and
evidently
i
fancy
beebe
jumped
back
into
the
this
way
please
honeychurch
this
they
followed
him
up
the
bank
attempting
the
tense
yet
nonchalant
expression
that
is
suitable
for
ladies
on
such
occasions
well
i
can
t
help
it
said
a
voice
close
ahead
and
freddy
reared
a
freckled
face
and
a
pair
of
snowy
shoulders
out
of
the
fronds
i
can
t
be
trodden
on
can
i
good
gracious
me
dear
so
it
s
you
what
miserable
management
why
not
have
a
comfortable
bath
at
home
with
hot
and
cold
laid
on
look
here
mother
a
fellow
must
wash
and
a
fellow
s
got
to
dry
and
if
another
fellow
dear
no
doubt
you
re
right
as
usual
but
you
are
in
no
position
to
argue
come
they
turned
oh
look
don
t
look
oh
poor
beebe
how
unfortunate
again
for
beebe
was
just
crawling
out
of
the
pond
on
whose
surface
garments
of
an
intimate
nature
did
float
while
george
the
george
shouted
to
freddy
that
he
had
hooked
a
fish
and
me
i
ve
swallowed
one
answered
he
of
the
bracken
i
ve
swallowed
a
pollywog
it
wriggleth
in
my
tummy
i
shall
die
emerson
you
beast
you
ve
got
on
my
hush
dears
said
honeychurch
who
found
it
impossible
to
remain
shocked
and
do
be
sure
you
dry
yourselves
thoroughly
first
all
these
colds
come
of
not
drying
mother
do
come
away
said
lucy
oh
for
goodness
sake
do
hullo
cried
george
so
that
again
the
ladies
stopped
he
regarded
himself
as
dressed
barefoot
radiant
and
personable
against
the
shadowy
woods
he
called
hullo
miss
honeychurch
hullo
bow
lucy
better
bow
whoever
is
it
i
shall
miss
honeychurch
bowed
that
evening
and
all
that
night
the
water
ran
away
on
the
morrow
the
pool
had
shrunk
to
its
old
size
and
lost
its
glory
it
had
been
a
call
to
the
blood
and
to
the
relaxed
will
a
passing
benediction
whose
influence
did
not
pass
a
holiness
a
spell
a
momentary
chalice
for
youth
chapter
xiii
how
miss
bartlett
s
boiler
was
so
tiresome
how
often
had
lucy
rehearsed
this
bow
this
interview
but
she
had
always
rehearsed
them
indoors
and
with
certain
accessories
which
surely
we
have
a
right
to
assume
who
could
foretell
that
she
and
george
would
meet
in
the
rout
of
a
civilization
amidst
an
army
of
coats
and
collars
and
boots
that
lay
wounded
over
the
sunlit
earth
she
had
imagined
a
young
emerson
who
might
be
shy
or
morbid
or
indifferent
or
furtively
impudent
she
was
prepared
for
all
of
these
but
she
had
never
imagined
one
who
would
be
happy
and
greet
her
with
the
shout
of
the
morning
star
indoors
herself
partaking
of
tea
with
old
butterworth
she
reflected
that
it
is
impossible
to
foretell
the
future
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
that
it
is
impossible
to
rehearse
life
a
fault
in
the
scenery
a
face
in
the
audience
an
irruption
of
the
audience
on
to
the
stage
and
all
our
carefully
planned
gestures
mean
nothing
or
mean
too
much
i
will
bow
she
had
thought
i
will
not
shake
hands
with
him
that
will
be
just
the
proper
she
had
bowed
but
to
whom
to
gods
to
heroes
to
the
nonsense
of
she
had
bowed
across
the
rubbish
that
cumbers
the
world
so
ran
her
thoughts
while
her
faculties
were
busy
with
cecil
it
was
another
of
those
dreadful
engagement
calls
butterworth
had
wanted
to
see
him
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
he
did
not
want
to
hear
about
hydrangeas
why
they
change
their
colour
at
the
seaside
he
did
not
want
to
join
the
when
cross
he
was
always
elaborate
and
made
long
clever
answers
where
yes
or
no
would
have
done
lucy
soothed
him
and
tinkered
at
the
conversation
in
a
way
that
promised
well
for
their
married
peace
no
one
is
perfect
and
surely
it
is
wiser
to
discover
the
imperfections
before
wedlock
miss
bartlett
indeed
though
not
in
word
had
taught
the
girl
that
this
our
life
contains
nothing
satisfactory
lucy
though
she
disliked
the
teacher
regarded
the
teaching
as
profound
and
applied
it
to
her
lover
lucy
said
her
mother
when
they
got
home
is
anything
the
matter
with
cecil
the
question
was
ominous
up
till
now
honeychurch
had
behaved
with
charity
and
restraint
no
i
don
t
think
so
mother
cecil
s
all
perhaps
he
s
lucy
compromised
perhaps
cecil
was
a
little
tired
because
otherwise
she
pulled
out
her
with
gathering
displeasure
because
otherwise
i
can
not
account
for
i
do
think
butterworth
is
rather
tiresome
if
you
mean
cecil
has
told
you
to
think
so
you
were
devoted
to
her
as
a
little
girl
and
nothing
will
describe
her
goodness
to
you
through
the
typhoid
fever
no
it
is
just
the
same
thing
let
me
just
put
your
bonnet
away
may
i
surely
he
could
answer
her
civilly
for
one
cecil
has
a
very
high
standard
for
people
faltered
lucy
seeing
trouble
ahead
it
s
part
of
his
ideals
it
is
really
that
that
makes
him
sometimes
seem
oh
rubbish
if
high
ideals
make
a
young
man
rude
the
sooner
he
gets
rid
of
them
the
better
said
honeychurch
handing
her
the
bonnet
now
mother
i
ve
seen
you
cross
with
butterworth
yourself
not
in
that
way
at
times
i
could
wring
her
neck
but
not
in
that
way
no
it
is
the
same
with
cecil
all
i
never
told
you
i
had
a
letter
from
charlotte
while
i
was
away
in
this
attempt
to
divert
the
conversation
was
too
puerile
and
honeychurch
resented
it
since
cecil
came
back
from
london
nothing
appears
to
please
him
whenever
i
speak
he
winces
i
see
him
lucy
it
is
useless
to
contradict
me
no
doubt
i
am
neither
artistic
nor
literary
nor
intellectual
nor
musical
but
i
can
not
help
the
furniture
your
father
bought
it
and
we
must
put
up
with
it
will
cecil
kindly
i
i
see
what
you
mean
and
certainly
cecil
oughtn
t
to
but
he
does
not
mean
to
be
uncivil
he
once
explained
it
is
the
things
that
upset
him
he
is
easily
upset
by
ugly
things
he
is
not
uncivil
to
is
it
a
thing
or
a
person
when
freddy
sings
you
can
t
expect
a
really
musical
person
to
enjoy
comic
songs
as
we
then
why
didn
t
he
leave
the
room
why
sit
wriggling
and
sneering
and
spoiling
everyone
s
pleasure
we
mustn
t
be
unjust
to
people
faltered
lucy
something
had
enfeebled
her
and
the
case
for
cecil
which
she
had
mastered
so
perfectly
in
london
would
not
come
forth
in
an
effective
form
the
two
civilizations
had
clashed
cecil
hinted
that
they
might
and
she
was
dazzled
and
bewildered
as
though
the
radiance
that
lies
behind
all
civilization
had
blinded
her
eyes
good
taste
and
bad
taste
were
only
catchwords
garments
of
diverse
cut
and
music
itself
dissolved
to
a
whisper
through
where
the
song
is
not
distinguishable
from
the
comic
song
she
remained
in
much
embarrassment
while
honeychurch
changed
her
frock
for
dinner
and
every
now
and
then
she
said
a
word
and
made
things
no
better
there
was
no
concealing
the
fact
cecil
had
meant
to
be
supercilious
and
he
had
succeeded
and
lucy
she
knew
not
why
wished
that
the
trouble
could
have
come
at
any
other
time
go
and
dress
dear
you
ll
be
all
right
mother
don
t
say
all
right
and
stop
she
obeyed
but
loitered
disconsolately
at
the
landing
window
it
faced
north
so
there
was
little
view
and
no
view
of
the
sky
now
as
in
the
winter
the
hung
close
to
her
eyes
one
connected
the
landing
window
with
depression
no
definite
problem
menaced
her
but
she
sighed
to
herself
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
it
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
else
was
behaving
very
badly
and
she
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
miss
bartlett
s
letter
she
must
be
more
careful
her
mother
was
rather
inquisitive
and
might
have
asked
what
it
was
about
oh
dear
what
should
she
do
and
then
freddy
came
bounding
upstairs
and
joined
the
ranks
of
the
i
say
those
are
topping
my
dear
baby
how
tiresome
you
ve
been
you
have
no
business
to
take
them
bathing
in
the
sacred
lake
it
s
much
too
public
it
was
all
right
for
you
but
most
awkward
for
everyone
else
do
be
more
careful
you
forget
the
place
is
growing
half
i
say
is
anything
on
week
not
that
i
know
then
i
want
to
ask
the
emersons
up
to
sunday
oh
i
wouldn
t
do
that
freddy
i
wouldn
t
do
that
with
all
this
what
s
wrong
with
the
court
they
won
t
mind
a
bump
or
two
and
i
ve
ordered
new
i
meant
it
s
better
not
i
really
mean
he
seized
her
by
the
elbows
and
humorously
danced
her
up
and
down
the
passage
she
pretended
not
to
mind
but
she
could
have
screamed
with
temper
cecil
glanced
at
them
as
he
proceeded
to
his
toilet
and
they
impeded
mary
with
her
brood
of
cans
then
honeychurch
opened
her
door
and
said
lucy
what
a
noise
you
re
making
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
did
you
say
you
had
had
a
letter
from
charlotte
and
freddy
ran
away
yes
i
really
can
t
stop
i
must
dress
how
s
charlotte
all
lucy
the
unfortunate
girl
returned
you
ve
a
bad
habit
of
hurrying
away
in
the
middle
of
one
s
sentences
did
charlotte
mention
her
boiler
her
what
don
t
you
remember
that
her
boiler
was
to
be
had
out
in
october
and
her
bath
cistern
cleaned
out
and
all
kinds
of
terrible
i
can
t
remember
all
charlotte
s
worries
said
lucy
bitterly
i
shall
have
enough
of
my
own
now
that
you
are
not
pleased
with
honeychurch
might
have
flamed
out
she
did
not
she
said
come
here
old
lady
thank
you
for
putting
away
my
bonnet
kiss
and
though
nothing
is
perfect
lucy
felt
for
the
moment
that
her
mother
and
windy
corner
and
the
weald
in
the
declining
sun
were
perfect
so
the
grittiness
went
out
of
life
it
generally
did
at
windy
corner
at
the
last
minute
when
the
social
machine
was
clogged
hopelessly
one
member
or
other
of
the
family
poured
in
a
drop
of
oil
cecil
despised
their
methods
perhaps
rightly
at
all
events
they
were
not
his
own
dinner
was
at
seven
freddy
gabbled
the
grace
and
they
drew
up
their
heavy
chairs
and
fell
to
fortunately
the
men
were
hungry
nothing
untoward
occurred
until
the
pudding
then
freddy
said
lucy
what
s
emerson
like
i
saw
him
in
florence
said
lucy
hoping
that
this
would
pass
for
a
reply
is
he
the
clever
sort
or
is
he
a
decent
chap
ask
cecil
it
is
cecil
who
brought
him
he
is
the
clever
sort
like
myself
said
cecil
freddy
looked
at
him
doubtfully
how
well
did
you
know
them
at
the
bertolini
asked
honeychurch
oh
very
slightly
i
mean
charlotte
knew
them
even
less
than
i
oh
that
reminds
me
you
never
told
me
what
charlotte
said
in
her
one
thing
and
another
said
lucy
wondering
whether
she
would
get
through
the
meal
without
a
lie
among
other
things
that
an
awful
friend
of
hers
had
been
bicycling
through
summer
street
wondered
if
she
d
come
up
and
see
us
and
mercifully
didn
lucy
i
do
call
the
way
you
talk
she
was
a
novelist
said
lucy
craftily
the
remark
was
a
happy
one
for
nothing
roused
honeychurch
so
much
as
literature
in
the
hands
of
females
she
would
abandon
every
topic
to
inveigh
against
those
women
who
instead
of
minding
their
houses
and
their
children
seek
notoriety
by
print
her
attitude
was
if
books
must
be
written
let
them
be
written
by
men
and
she
developed
it
at
great
length
while
cecil
yawned
and
freddy
played
at
this
year
next
year
now
never
with
his
and
lucy
artfully
fed
the
flames
of
her
mother
s
wrath
but
soon
the
conflagration
died
down
and
the
ghosts
began
to
gather
in
the
darkness
there
were
too
many
ghosts
about
the
original
ghost
that
touch
of
lips
on
her
cheek
had
surely
been
laid
long
ago
it
could
be
nothing
to
her
that
a
man
had
kissed
her
on
a
mountain
once
but
it
had
begotten
a
spectral
family
harris
miss
bartlett
s
letter
beebe
s
memories
of
violets
and
one
or
other
of
these
was
bound
to
haunt
her
before
cecil
s
very
eyes
it
was
miss
bartlett
who
returned
now
and
with
appalling
vividness
i
have
been
thinking
lucy
of
that
letter
of
charlotte
s
how
is
she
i
tore
the
thing
didn
t
she
say
how
she
was
how
does
she
sound
cheerful
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
no
not
very
cheerful
i
then
depend
upon
it
it
is
the
boiler
i
know
myself
how
water
preys
upon
one
s
mind
i
would
rather
anything
else
even
a
misfortune
with
the
cecil
laid
his
hand
over
his
eyes
so
would
i
asserted
freddy
backing
his
mother
up
backing
up
the
spirit
of
her
remark
rather
than
the
substance
and
i
have
been
thinking
she
added
rather
nervously
surely
we
could
squeeze
charlotte
in
here
next
week
and
give
her
a
nice
holiday
while
plumbers
at
tunbridge
wells
finish
i
have
not
seen
poor
charlotte
for
so
it
was
more
than
her
nerves
could
stand
and
she
could
not
protest
violently
after
her
mother
s
goodness
to
her
upstairs
mother
no
she
pleaded
it
s
impossible
we
can
t
have
charlotte
on
the
top
of
the
other
things
we
re
squeezed
to
death
as
it
is
freddy
s
got
a
friend
coming
tuesday
there
s
cecil
and
you
ve
promised
to
take
in
minnie
beebe
because
of
the
diphtheria
scare
it
simply
can
t
be
nonsense
it
if
minnie
sleeps
in
the
bath
not
minnie
can
sleep
with
i
won
t
have
then
if
you
re
so
selfish
floyd
must
share
a
room
with
miss
bartlett
miss
bartlett
miss
bartlett
moaned
cecil
again
laying
his
hand
over
his
eyes
it
s
impossible
repeated
lucy
i
don
t
want
to
make
difficulties
but
it
really
isn
t
fair
on
the
maids
to
fill
up
the
house
alas
the
truth
is
dear
you
don
t
like
no
i
don
t
and
no
more
does
cecil
she
gets
on
our
nerves
you
haven
t
seen
her
lately
and
don
t
realize
how
tiresome
she
can
be
though
so
good
so
please
mother
don
t
worry
us
this
last
summer
but
spoil
us
by
not
asking
her
to
hear
hear
said
cecil
honeychurch
with
more
gravity
than
usual
and
with
more
feeling
than
she
usually
permitted
herself
replied
this
isn
t
very
kind
of
you
two
you
have
each
other
and
all
these
woods
to
walk
in
so
full
of
beautiful
things
and
poor
charlotte
has
only
the
water
turned
off
and
plumbers
you
are
young
dears
and
however
clever
young
people
are
and
however
many
books
they
read
they
will
never
guess
what
it
feels
like
to
grow
cecil
crumbled
his
bread
i
must
say
cousin
charlotte
was
very
kind
to
me
that
year
i
called
on
my
bike
put
in
freddy
she
thanked
me
for
coming
till
i
felt
like
such
a
fool
and
fussed
round
no
end
to
get
an
egg
boiled
for
my
tea
just
i
know
dear
she
is
kind
to
everyone
and
yet
lucy
makes
this
difficulty
when
we
try
to
give
her
some
little
but
lucy
hardened
her
heart
it
was
no
good
being
kind
to
miss
bartlett
she
had
tried
herself
too
often
and
too
recently
one
might
lay
up
treasure
in
heaven
by
the
attempt
but
one
enriched
neither
miss
bartlett
nor
any
one
else
upon
earth
she
was
reduced
to
saying
i
can
t
help
it
mother
i
don
t
like
charlotte
i
admit
it
s
horrid
of
from
your
own
account
you
told
her
as
well
she
would
leave
florence
so
stupidly
she
flurried
the
ghosts
were
returning
they
filled
italy
they
were
even
usurping
the
places
she
had
known
as
a
child
the
sacred
lake
would
never
be
the
same
again
and
on
sunday
week
something
would
even
happen
to
windy
corner
how
would
she
fight
against
ghosts
for
a
moment
the
visible
world
faded
away
and
memories
and
emotions
alone
seemed
real
i
suppose
miss
bartlett
must
come
since
she
boils
eggs
so
well
said
cecil
who
was
in
rather
a
happier
frame
of
mind
thanks
to
the
admirable
cooking
i
didn
t
mean
the
egg
was
well
boiled
corrected
freddy
because
in
point
of
fact
she
forgot
to
take
it
off
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don
t
care
for
eggs
i
only
meant
how
jolly
kind
she
cecil
frowned
again
oh
these
honeychurches
eggs
boilers
hydrangeas
maids
of
such
were
their
lives
compact
may
me
and
lucy
get
down
from
our
chairs
he
asked
with
scarcely
veiled
insolence
we
don
t
want
no
chapter
xiv
how
lucy
faced
the
external
situation
bravely
of
course
miss
bartlett
accepted
and
equally
of
course
she
felt
sure
that
she
would
prove
a
nuisance
and
begged
to
be
given
an
inferior
spare
room
something
with
no
view
anything
her
love
to
lucy
and
equally
of
course
george
emerson
could
come
to
tennis
on
the
sunday
week
lucy
faced
the
situation
bravely
though
like
most
of
us
she
only
faced
the
situation
that
encompassed
her
she
never
gazed
inwards
if
at
times
strange
images
rose
from
the
depths
she
put
them
down
to
nerves
when
cecil
brought
the
emersons
to
summer
street
it
had
upset
her
nerves
charlotte
would
burnish
up
past
foolishness
and
this
might
upset
her
nerves
she
was
nervous
at
night
when
she
talked
to
george
they
met
again
almost
immediately
at
the
rectory
his
voice
moved
her
deeply
and
she
wished
to
remain
near
him
how
dreadful
if
she
really
wished
to
remain
near
him
of
course
the
wish
was
due
to
nerves
which
love
to
play
such
perverse
tricks
upon
us
once
she
had
suffered
from
things
that
came
out
of
nothing
and
meant
she
didn
t
know
now
cecil
had
explained
psychology
to
her
one
wet
afternoon
and
all
the
troubles
of
youth
in
an
unknown
world
could
be
dismissed
it
is
obvious
enough
for
the
reader
to
conclude
she
loves
young
a
reader
in
lucy
s
place
would
not
find
it
obvious
life
is
easy
to
chronicle
but
bewildering
to
practice
and
we
welcome
nerves
or
any
other
shibboleth
that
will
cloak
our
personal
desire
she
loved
cecil
george
made
her
nervous
will
the
reader
explain
to
her
that
the
phrases
should
have
been
reversed
but
the
external
situation
she
will
face
that
bravely
the
meeting
at
the
rectory
had
passed
off
well
enough
standing
between
beebe
and
cecil
she
had
made
a
few
temperate
allusions
to
italy
and
george
had
replied
she
was
anxious
to
show
that
she
was
not
shy
and
was
glad
that
he
did
not
seem
shy
either
a
nice
fellow
said
beebe
afterwards
he
will
work
off
his
crudities
in
time
i
rather
mistrust
young
men
who
slip
into
life
lucy
said
he
seems
in
better
spirits
he
laughs
yes
replied
the
clergyman
he
is
waking
that
was
all
but
as
the
week
wore
on
more
of
her
defences
fell
and
she
entertained
an
image
that
had
physical
beauty
in
spite
of
the
clearest
directions
miss
bartlett
contrived
to
bungle
her
arrival
she
was
due
at
the
station
at
dorking
whither
honeychurch
drove
to
meet
her
she
arrived
at
the
london
and
brighton
station
and
had
to
hire
a
cab
up
no
one
was
at
home
except
freddy
and
his
friend
who
had
to
stop
their
tennis
and
to
entertain
her
for
a
solid
hour
cecil
and
lucy
turned
up
at
four
o
clock
and
these
with
little
minnie
beebe
made
a
somewhat
lugubrious
sextette
upon
the
upper
lawn
for
tea
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
said
miss
bartlett
who
kept
on
rising
from
her
seat
and
had
to
be
begged
by
the
united
company
to
remain
i
have
upset
everything
bursting
in
on
young
people
but
i
insist
on
paying
for
my
cab
up
grant
that
at
any
our
visitors
never
do
such
dreadful
things
said
lucy
while
her
brother
in
whose
memory
the
boiled
egg
had
already
grown
unsubstantial
exclaimed
in
irritable
tones
just
what
i
ve
been
trying
to
convince
cousin
charlotte
of
lucy
for
the
last
half
i
do
not
feel
myself
an
ordinary
visitor
said
miss
bartlett
and
looked
at
her
frayed
glove
all
right
if
you
d
really
rather
five
shillings
and
i
gave
a
bob
to
the
miss
bartlett
looked
in
her
purse
only
sovereigns
and
pennies
could
any
one
give
her
change
freddy
had
half
a
quid
and
his
friend
had
four
miss
bartlett
accepted
their
moneys
and
then
said
but
who
am
i
to
give
the
sovereign
to
let
s
leave
it
all
till
mother
comes
back
suggested
lucy
no
dear
your
mother
may
take
quite
a
long
drive
now
that
she
is
not
hampered
with
me
we
all
have
our
little
foibles
and
mine
is
the
prompt
settling
of
here
freddy
s
friend
floyd
made
the
one
remark
of
his
that
need
be
quoted
he
offered
to
toss
freddy
for
miss
bartlett
s
quid
a
solution
seemed
in
sight
and
even
cecil
who
had
been
ostentatiously
drinking
his
tea
at
the
view
felt
the
eternal
attraction
of
chance
and
turned
round
but
this
did
not
do
either
please
please
i
know
i
am
a
sad
but
it
would
make
me
wretched
i
should
practically
be
robbing
the
one
who
freddy
owes
me
fifteen
shillings
interposed
cecil
so
it
will
work
out
right
if
you
give
the
pound
to
fifteen
shillings
said
miss
bartlett
dubiously
how
is
that
vyse
because
don
t
you
see
freddy
paid
your
cab
give
me
the
pound
and
we
shall
avoid
this
deplorable
miss
bartlett
who
was
poor
at
figures
became
bewildered
and
rendered
up
the
sovereign
amidst
the
suppressed
gurgles
of
the
other
youths
for
a
moment
cecil
was
happy
he
was
playing
at
nonsense
among
his
peers
then
he
glanced
at
lucy
in
whose
face
petty
anxieties
had
marred
the
smiles
in
january
he
would
rescue
his
leonardo
from
this
stupefying
twaddle
but
i
don
t
see
that
exclaimed
minnie
beebe
who
had
narrowly
watched
the
iniquitous
transaction
i
don
t
see
why
vyse
is
to
have
the
because
of
the
fifteen
shillings
and
the
five
they
said
solemnly
fifteen
shillings
and
five
shillings
make
one
pound
you
but
i
don
t
see
they
tried
to
stifle
her
with
cake
no
thank
you
i
m
done
i
don
t
see
why
freddy
don
t
poke
me
miss
honeychurch
your
brother
s
hurting
me
ow
what
about
floyd
s
ten
shillings
ow
no
i
don
t
see
and
i
never
shall
see
why
miss
what
shouldn
t
pay
that
bob
for
the
i
had
forgotten
the
driver
said
miss
bartlett
reddening
thank
you
dear
for
reminding
me
a
shilling
was
it
can
any
one
give
me
change
for
half
a
crown
i
ll
get
it
said
the
young
hostess
rising
with
decision
cecil
give
me
that
sovereign
no
give
me
up
that
sovereign
i
ll
get
euphemia
to
change
it
and
we
ll
start
the
whole
thing
again
from
the
lucy
lucy
what
a
nuisance
i
am
protested
miss
bartlett
and
followed
her
across
the
lawn
lucy
tripped
ahead
simulating
hilarity
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
miss
bartlett
stopped
her
wails
and
said
quite
briskly
have
you
told
him
about
him
yet
no
i
haven
t
replied
lucy
and
then
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
for
understanding
so
quickly
what
her
cousin
meant
let
me
see
a
sovereign
s
worth
of
she
escaped
into
the
kitchen
miss
bartlett
s
sudden
transitions
were
too
uncanny
it
sometimes
seemed
as
if
she
planned
every
word
she
spoke
or
caused
to
be
spoken
as
if
all
this
worry
about
cabs
and
change
had
been
a
ruse
to
surprise
the
soul
no
i
haven
t
told
cecil
or
any
one
she
remarked
when
she
returned
i
promised
you
i
shouldn
t
here
is
your
money
all
shillings
except
two
would
you
count
it
you
can
settle
your
debt
nicely
miss
bartlett
was
in
the
gazing
at
the
photograph
of
john
ascending
which
had
been
framed
how
dreadful
she
murmured
how
more
than
dreadful
if
vyse
should
come
to
hear
of
it
from
some
other
oh
no
charlotte
said
the
girl
entering
the
battle
george
emerson
is
all
right
and
what
other
source
is
there
miss
bartlett
considered
for
instance
the
driver
i
saw
him
looking
through
the
bushes
at
you
remember
he
had
a
violet
between
his
lucy
shuddered
a
little
we
shall
get
the
silly
affair
on
our
nerves
if
we
aren
t
careful
how
could
a
florentine
ever
get
hold
of
cecil
we
must
think
of
every
oh
it
s
all
or
perhaps
old
emerson
knows
in
fact
he
is
certain
to
i
don
t
care
if
he
does
i
was
grateful
to
you
for
your
letter
but
even
if
the
news
does
get
round
i
think
i
can
trust
cecil
to
laugh
at
to
contradict
it
no
to
laugh
at
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
could
not
trust
him
for
he
desired
her
untouched
very
well
dear
you
know
best
perhaps
gentlemen
are
different
to
what
they
were
when
i
was
young
ladies
are
certainly
now
charlotte
she
struck
at
her
playfully
you
kind
anxious
thing
what
would
you
have
me
do
first
you
say
don
t
tell
and
then
you
say
tell
which
is
it
to
be
quick
miss
bartlett
sighed
i
am
no
match
for
you
in
conversation
dearest
i
blush
when
i
think
how
i
interfered
at
florence
and
you
so
well
able
to
look
after
yourself
and
so
much
cleverer
in
all
ways
than
i
am
you
will
never
forgive
shall
we
go
out
then
they
will
smash
all
the
china
if
we
don
for
the
air
rang
with
the
shrieks
of
minnie
who
was
being
scalped
with
a
teaspoon
dear
one
moment
we
may
not
have
this
chance
for
a
chat
again
have
you
seen
the
young
one
yet
yes
i
what
happened
we
met
at
the
what
line
is
he
taking
up
no
line
he
talked
about
italy
like
any
other
person
it
is
really
all
right
what
advantage
would
he
get
from
being
a
cad
to
put
it
bluntly
i
do
wish
i
could
make
you
see
it
my
way
he
really
won
t
be
any
nuisance
once
a
cad
always
a
cad
that
is
my
poor
lucy
paused
cecil
said
one
day
and
i
thought
it
so
profound
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
cads
the
conscious
and
the
she
paused
again
to
be
sure
of
doing
justice
to
cecil
s
profundity
through
the
window
she
saw
cecil
himself
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
novel
it
was
a
new
one
from
smith
s
library
her
mother
must
have
returned
from
the
station
once
a
cad
always
a
cad
droned
miss
bartlett
what
i
mean
by
subconscious
is
that
emerson
lost
his
head
i
fell
into
all
those
violets
and
he
was
silly
and
surprised
i
don
t
think
we
ought
to
blame
him
very
much
it
makes
such
a
difference
when
you
see
a
person
with
beautiful
things
behind
him
unexpectedly
it
really
does
it
makes
an
enormous
difference
and
he
lost
his
head
he
doesn
t
admire
me
or
any
of
that
nonsense
one
straw
freddy
rather
likes
him
and
has
asked
him
up
here
on
sunday
so
you
can
judge
for
yourself
he
has
improved
he
doesn
t
always
look
as
if
he
s
going
to
burst
into
tears
he
is
a
clerk
in
the
general
manager
s
office
at
one
of
the
big
railways
not
a
porter
and
runs
down
to
his
father
for
papa
was
to
do
with
journalism
but
is
rheumatic
and
has
retired
there
now
for
the
she
took
hold
of
her
guest
by
the
arm
suppose
we
don
t
talk
about
this
silly
italian
business
any
more
we
want
you
to
have
a
nice
restful
visit
at
windy
corner
with
no
lucy
thought
this
rather
a
good
speech
the
reader
may
have
detected
an
unfortunate
slip
in
it
whether
miss
bartlett
detected
the
slip
one
can
not
say
for
it
is
impossible
to
penetrate
into
the
minds
of
elderly
people
she
might
have
spoken
further
but
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
her
hostess
explanations
took
place
and
in
the
midst
of
them
lucy
escaped
the
images
throbbing
a
little
more
vividly
in
her
brain
chapter
xv
the
disaster
within
the
sunday
after
miss
bartlett
s
arrival
was
a
glorious
day
like
most
of
the
days
of
that
year
in
the
weald
autumn
approached
breaking
up
the
green
monotony
of
summer
touching
the
parks
with
the
grey
bloom
of
mist
the
with
russet
the
with
gold
up
on
the
heights
battalions
of
black
pines
witnessed
the
change
themselves
unchangeable
either
country
was
spanned
by
a
cloudless
sky
and
in
either
arose
the
tinkle
of
church
bells
the
garden
of
windy
corners
was
deserted
except
for
a
red
book
which
lay
sunning
itself
upon
the
gravel
path
from
the
house
came
incoherent
sounds
as
of
females
preparing
for
worship
the
men
say
they
won
t
go
well
i
don
t
blame
them
minnie
says
need
she
go
tell
her
no
nonsense
anne
mary
hook
me
behind
dearest
lucia
may
i
trespass
upon
you
for
a
pin
for
miss
bartlett
had
announced
that
she
at
all
events
was
one
for
church
the
sun
rose
higher
on
its
journey
guided
not
by
phaethon
but
by
apollo
competent
unswerving
divine
its
rays
fell
on
the
ladies
whenever
they
advanced
towards
the
bedroom
windows
on
beebe
down
at
summer
street
as
he
smiled
over
a
letter
from
miss
catharine
alan
on
george
emerson
cleaning
his
father
s
boots
and
lastly
to
complete
the
catalogue
of
memorable
things
on
the
red
book
mentioned
previously
the
ladies
move
beebe
moves
george
moves
and
movement
may
engender
shadow
but
this
book
lies
motionless
to
be
caressed
all
the
morning
by
the
sun
and
to
raise
its
covers
slightly
as
though
acknowledging
the
caress
presently
lucy
steps
out
of
the
window
her
new
cerise
dress
has
been
a
failure
and
makes
her
look
tawdry
and
wan
at
her
throat
is
a
garnet
brooch
on
her
finger
a
ring
set
with
rubies
an
engagement
ring
her
eyes
are
bent
to
the
weald
she
frowns
a
little
not
in
anger
but
as
a
brave
child
frowns
when
he
is
trying
not
to
cry
in
all
that
expanse
no
human
eye
is
looking
at
her
and
she
may
frown
unrebuked
and
measure
the
spaces
that
yet
survive
between
apollo
and
the
western
hills
lucy
lucy
what
s
that
book
who
s
been
taking
a
book
out
of
the
shelf
and
leaving
it
about
to
spoil
it
s
only
the
library
book
that
cecil
s
been
but
pick
it
up
and
don
t
stand
idling
there
like
a
lucy
picked
up
the
book
and
glanced
at
the
title
listlessly
under
a
loggia
she
no
longer
read
novels
herself
devoting
all
her
spare
time
to
solid
literature
in
the
hope
of
catching
cecil
up
it
was
dreadful
how
little
she
knew
and
even
when
she
thought
she
knew
a
thing
like
the
italian
painters
she
found
she
had
forgotten
it
only
this
morning
she
had
confused
francesco
francia
with
piero
della
francesca
and
cecil
had
said
what
you
aren
t
forgetting
your
italy
already
and
this
too
had
lent
anxiety
to
her
eyes
when
she
saluted
the
dear
view
and
the
dear
garden
in
the
foreground
and
above
them
scarcely
conceivable
elsewhere
the
dear
sun
lucy
have
you
a
sixpence
for
minnie
and
a
shilling
for
yourself
she
hastened
in
to
her
mother
who
was
rapidly
working
herself
into
a
sunday
fluster
it
s
a
special
collection
i
forget
what
for
i
do
beg
no
vulgar
clinking
in
the
plate
with
halfpennies
see
that
minnie
has
a
nice
bright
sixpence
where
is
the
child
minnie
that
book
s
all
warped
gracious
how
plain
you
look
put
it
under
the
atlas
to
press
minnie
oh
honeychurch
from
the
upper
regions
minnie
don
t
be
late
here
comes
the
horse
it
was
always
the
horse
never
the
carriage
where
s
charlotte
run
up
and
hurry
her
why
is
she
so
long
she
had
nothing
to
do
she
never
brings
anything
but
blouses
poor
charlotte
how
i
do
detest
blouses
minnie
paganism
is
infectious
more
infectious
than
diphtheria
or
piety
and
the
rector
s
niece
was
taken
to
church
protesting
as
usual
she
didn
t
see
why
why
shouldn
t
she
sit
in
the
sun
with
the
young
men
the
young
men
who
had
now
appeared
mocked
her
with
ungenerous
words
honeychurch
defended
orthodoxy
and
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
miss
bartlett
dressed
in
the
very
height
of
the
fashion
came
strolling
down
the
stairs
dear
marian
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
have
no
small
change
nothing
but
sovereigns
and
half
crowns
could
any
one
give
me
yes
easily
jump
in
gracious
me
how
smart
you
look
what
a
lovely
frock
you
put
us
all
to
if
i
did
not
wear
my
best
rags
and
tatters
now
when
should
i
wear
them
said
miss
bartlett
reproachfully
she
got
into
the
victoria
and
placed
herself
with
her
back
to
the
horse
the
necessary
roar
ensued
and
then
they
drove
off
be
good
called
out
cecil
lucy
bit
her
lip
for
the
tone
was
sneering
on
the
subject
of
church
and
so
on
they
had
had
rather
an
unsatisfactory
conversation
he
had
said
that
people
ought
to
overhaul
themselves
and
she
did
not
want
to
overhaul
herself
she
did
not
know
it
was
done
honest
orthodoxy
cecil
respected
but
he
always
assumed
that
honesty
is
the
result
of
a
spiritual
crisis
he
could
not
imagine
it
as
a
natural
birthright
that
might
grow
heavenward
like
flowers
all
that
he
said
on
this
subject
pained
her
though
he
exuded
tolerance
from
every
pore
somehow
the
emersons
were
different
she
saw
the
emersons
after
church
there
was
a
line
of
carriages
down
the
road
and
the
honeychurch
vehicle
happened
to
be
opposite
cissie
villa
to
save
time
they
walked
over
the
green
to
it
and
found
father
and
son
smoking
in
the
garden
introduce
me
said
her
mother
unless
the
young
man
considers
that
he
knows
me
he
probably
did
but
lucy
ignored
the
sacred
lake
and
introduced
them
formally
old
emerson
claimed
her
with
much
warmth
and
said
how
glad
he
was
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
she
said
yes
she
was
glad
too
and
then
as
miss
bartlett
and
minnie
were
lingering
behind
with
beebe
she
turned
the
conversation
to
a
less
disturbing
topic
and
asked
him
how
he
liked
his
new
house
very
much
he
replied
but
there
was
a
note
of
offence
in
his
voice
she
had
never
known
him
offended
before
he
added
we
find
though
that
the
miss
alans
were
coming
and
that
we
have
turned
them
out
women
mind
such
a
thing
i
am
very
much
upset
about
i
believe
that
there
was
some
misunderstanding
said
honeychurch
uneasily
our
landlord
was
told
that
we
should
be
a
different
type
of
person
said
george
who
seemed
disposed
to
carry
the
matter
further
he
thought
we
should
be
artistic
he
is
and
i
wonder
whether
we
ought
to
write
to
the
miss
alans
and
offer
to
give
it
up
what
do
you
think
he
appealed
to
lucy
oh
stop
now
you
have
come
said
lucy
lightly
she
must
avoid
censuring
cecil
for
it
was
on
cecil
that
the
little
episode
turned
though
his
name
was
never
mentioned
so
george
says
he
says
that
the
miss
alans
must
go
to
the
wall
yet
it
does
seem
so
there
is
only
a
certain
amount
of
kindness
in
the
world
said
george
watching
the
sunlight
flash
on
the
panels
of
the
passing
carriages
yes
exclaimed
honeychurch
that
s
exactly
what
i
say
why
all
this
twiddling
and
twaddling
over
two
miss
alans
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
kindness
just
as
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
light
he
continued
in
measured
tones
we
cast
a
shadow
on
something
wherever
we
stand
and
it
is
no
good
moving
from
place
to
place
to
save
things
because
the
shadow
always
follows
choose
a
place
where
you
won
t
do
harm
yes
choose
a
place
where
you
won
t
do
very
much
harm
and
stand
in
it
for
all
you
are
worth
facing
the
oh
emerson
i
see
you
re
clever
eh
i
see
you
re
going
to
be
clever
i
hope
you
didn
t
go
behaving
like
that
to
poor
george
s
eyes
laughed
and
lucy
suspected
that
he
and
her
mother
would
get
on
rather
well
no
i
didn
t
he
said
he
behaved
that
way
to
me
it
is
his
philosophy
only
he
starts
life
with
it
and
i
have
tried
the
note
of
interrogation
what
do
you
mean
no
never
mind
what
you
mean
don
t
explain
he
looks
forward
to
seeing
you
this
afternoon
do
you
play
tennis
do
you
mind
tennis
on
sunday
george
mind
tennis
on
sunday
george
after
his
education
distinguish
between
sunday
very
well
george
doesn
t
mind
tennis
on
sunday
no
more
do
that
s
settled
emerson
if
you
could
come
with
your
son
we
should
be
so
he
thanked
her
but
the
walk
sounded
rather
far
he
could
only
potter
about
in
these
days
she
turned
to
george
and
then
he
wants
to
give
up
his
house
to
the
miss
i
know
said
george
and
put
his
arm
round
his
father
s
neck
the
kindness
that
beebe
and
lucy
had
always
known
to
exist
in
him
came
out
suddenly
like
sunlight
touching
a
vast
landscape
a
touch
of
the
morning
sun
she
remembered
that
in
all
his
perversities
he
had
never
spoken
against
affection
miss
bartlett
approached
you
know
our
cousin
miss
bartlett
said
honeychurch
pleasantly
you
met
her
with
my
daughter
in
yes
indeed
said
the
old
man
and
made
as
if
he
would
come
out
of
the
garden
to
meet
the
lady
miss
bartlett
promptly
got
into
the
victoria
thus
entrenched
she
emitted
a
formal
bow
it
was
the
pension
bertolini
again
the
with
the
decanters
of
water
and
wine
it
was
the
old
old
battle
of
the
room
with
the
view
george
did
not
respond
to
the
bow
like
any
boy
he
blushed
and
was
ashamed
he
knew
that
the
chaperon
remembered
he
said
i
i
ll
come
up
to
tennis
if
i
can
manage
it
and
went
into
the
house
perhaps
anything
that
he
did
would
have
pleased
lucy
but
his
awkwardness
went
straight
to
her
heart
men
were
not
gods
after
all
but
as
human
and
as
clumsy
as
girls
even
men
might
suffer
from
unexplained
desires
and
need
help
to
one
of
her
upbringing
and
of
her
destination
the
weakness
of
men
was
a
truth
unfamiliar
but
she
had
surmised
it
at
florence
when
george
threw
her
photographs
into
the
river
arno
george
don
t
go
cried
his
father
who
thought
it
a
great
treat
for
people
if
his
son
would
talk
to
them
george
has
been
in
such
good
spirits
today
and
i
am
sure
he
will
end
by
coming
up
this
lucy
caught
her
cousin
s
eye
something
in
its
mute
appeal
made
her
reckless
yes
she
said
raising
her
voice
i
do
hope
he
then
she
went
to
the
carriage
and
murmured
the
old
man
hasn
t
been
told
i
knew
it
was
all
honeychurch
followed
her
and
they
drove
away
satisfactory
that
emerson
had
not
been
told
of
the
florence
escapade
yet
lucy
s
spirits
should
not
have
leapt
up
as
if
she
had
sighted
the
ramparts
of
heaven
satisfactory
yet
surely
she
greeted
it
with
disproportionate
joy
all
the
way
home
the
horses
hoofs
sang
a
tune
to
her
he
has
not
told
he
has
not
her
brain
expanded
the
melody
he
has
not
told
his
father
to
whom
he
tells
all
things
it
was
not
an
exploit
he
did
not
laugh
at
me
when
i
had
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
cheek
he
does
not
love
me
no
how
terrible
if
he
did
but
he
has
not
told
he
will
not
she
longed
to
shout
the
words
it
is
all
right
it
s
a
secret
between
us
two
for
ever
cecil
will
never
she
was
even
glad
that
miss
bartlett
had
made
her
promise
secrecy
that
last
dark
evening
at
florence
when
they
had
knelt
packing
in
his
room
the
secret
big
or
little
was
guarded
only
three
english
people
knew
of
it
in
the
world
thus
she
interpreted
her
joy
she
greeted
cecil
with
unusual
radiance
because
she
felt
so
safe
as
he
helped
her
out
of
the
carriage
she
said
the
emersons
have
been
so
nice
george
emerson
has
improved
how
are
my
proteges
asked
cecil
who
took
no
real
interest
in
them
and
had
long
since
forgotten
his
resolution
to
bring
them
to
windy
corner
for
educational
purposes
proteges
she
exclaimed
with
some
warmth
for
the
only
relationship
which
cecil
conceived
was
feudal
that
of
protector
and
protected
he
had
no
glimpse
of
the
comradeship
after
which
the
girl
s
soul
yearned
you
shall
see
for
yourself
how
your
proteges
are
george
emerson
is
coming
up
this
afternoon
he
is
a
most
interesting
man
to
talk
to
only
don
t
she
nearly
said
don
t
protect
but
the
bell
was
ringing
for
lunch
and
as
often
happened
cecil
had
paid
no
great
attention
to
her
remarks
charm
not
argument
was
to
be
her
forte
lunch
was
a
cheerful
meal
generally
lucy
was
depressed
at
meals
some
one
had
to
be
soothed
either
cecil
or
miss
bartlett
or
a
being
not
visible
to
the
mortal
eye
a
being
who
whispered
to
her
soul
it
will
not
last
this
cheerfulness
in
january
you
must
go
to
london
to
entertain
the
grandchildren
of
celebrated
but
she
felt
she
had
received
a
guarantee
her
mother
would
always
sit
there
her
brother
here
the
sun
though
it
had
moved
a
little
since
the
morning
would
never
be
hidden
behind
the
western
hills
after
luncheon
they
asked
her
to
play
she
had
seen
gluck
s
armide
that
year
and
played
from
memory
the
music
of
the
enchanted
garden
the
music
to
which
renaud
approaches
beneath
the
light
of
an
eternal
dawn
the
music
that
never
gains
never
wanes
but
ripples
for
ever
like
the
tideless
seas
of
fairyland
such
music
is
not
for
the
piano
and
her
audience
began
to
get
restive
and
cecil
sharing
the
discontent
called
out
now
play
us
the
other
garden
the
one
in
she
closed
the
instrument
not
very
dutiful
said
her
mother
s
voice
fearing
that
she
had
offended
cecil
she
turned
quickly
round
there
george
was
he
had
crept
in
without
interrupting
her
oh
i
had
no
idea
she
exclaimed
getting
very
red
and
then
without
a
word
of
greeting
she
reopened
the
piano
cecil
should
have
the
parsifal
and
anything
else
that
he
liked
our
performer
has
changed
her
mind
said
miss
bartlett
perhaps
implying
she
will
play
the
music
to
emerson
lucy
did
not
know
what
to
do
nor
even
what
she
wanted
to
do
she
played
a
few
bars
of
the
flower
maidens
song
very
badly
and
then
she
stopped
i
vote
tennis
said
freddy
disgusted
at
the
scrappy
entertainment
yes
so
do
once
more
she
closed
the
unfortunate
piano
i
vote
you
have
a
men
s
all
not
for
me
thank
you
said
cecil
i
will
not
spoil
the
he
never
realized
that
it
may
be
an
act
of
kindness
in
a
bad
player
to
make
up
a
fourth
oh
come
along
cecil
i
m
bad
floyd
s
rotten
and
so
i
dare
say
s
george
corrected
him
i
am
not
one
looked
down
one
s
nose
at
this
then
certainly
i
won
t
play
said
cecil
while
miss
bartlett
under
the
impression
that
she
was
snubbing
george
added
i
agree
with
you
vyse
you
had
much
better
not
play
much
better
minnie
rushing
in
where
cecil
feared
to
tread
announced
that
she
would
play
i
shall
miss
every
ball
anyway
so
what
does
it
matter
but
sunday
intervened
and
stamped
heavily
upon
the
kindly
suggestion
then
it
will
have
to
be
lucy
said
honeychurch
you
must
fall
back
on
lucy
there
is
no
other
way
out
of
it
lucy
go
and
change
your
lucy
s
sabbath
was
generally
of
this
amphibious
nature
she
kept
it
without
hypocrisy
in
the
morning
and
broke
it
without
reluctance
in
the
afternoon
as
she
changed
her
frock
she
wondered
whether
cecil
was
sneering
at
her
really
she
must
overhaul
herself
and
settle
everything
up
before
she
married
him
floyd
was
her
partner
she
liked
music
but
how
much
better
tennis
seemed
how
much
better
to
run
about
in
comfortable
clothes
than
to
sit
at
the
piano
and
feel
girt
under
the
arms
once
more
music
appeared
to
her
the
employment
of
a
child
george
served
and
surprised
her
by
his
anxiety
to
win
she
remembered
how
he
had
sighed
among
the
tombs
at
santa
croce
because
things
wouldn
t
fit
how
after
the
death
of
that
obscure
italian
he
had
leant
over
the
parapet
by
the
arno
and
said
to
her
i
shall
want
to
live
i
tell
he
wanted
to
live
now
to
win
at
tennis
to
stand
for
all
he
was
worth
in
the
sun
the
sun
which
had
begun
to
decline
and
was
shining
in
her
eyes
and
he
did
win
ah
how
beautiful
the
weald
looked
the
hills
stood
out
above
its
radiance
as
fiesole
stands
above
the
tuscan
plain
and
the
south
downs
if
one
chose
were
the
mountains
of
carrara
she
might
be
forgetting
her
italy
but
she
was
noticing
more
things
in
her
england
one
could
play
a
new
game
with
the
view
and
try
to
find
in
its
innumerable
folds
some
town
or
village
that
would
do
for
florence
ah
how
beautiful
the
weald
looked
but
now
cecil
claimed
her
he
chanced
to
be
in
a
lucid
critical
mood
and
would
not
sympathize
with
exaltation
he
had
been
rather
a
nuisance
all
through
the
tennis
for
the
novel
that
he
was
reading
was
so
bad
that
he
was
obliged
to
read
it
aloud
to
others
he
would
stroll
round
the
precincts
of
the
court
and
call
out
i
say
listen
to
this
lucy
three
split
dreadful
said
lucy
and
missed
her
stroke
when
they
had
finished
their
set
he
still
went
on
reading
there
was
some
murder
scene
and
really
everyone
must
listen
to
it
freddy
and
floyd
were
obliged
to
hunt
for
a
lost
ball
in
the
laurels
but
the
other
two
acquiesced
the
scene
is
laid
in
what
fun
cecil
read
away
come
emerson
sit
down
after
all
your
she
had
forgiven
george
as
she
put
it
and
she
made
a
point
of
being
pleasant
to
him
he
jumped
over
the
net
and
sat
down
at
her
feet
asking
you
and
are
you
tired
of
course
i
m
not
do
you
mind
being
beaten
she
was
going
to
answer
no
when
it
struck
her
that
she
did
mind
so
she
answered
she
added
merrily
i
don
t
see
you
re
such
a
splendid
player
though
the
light
was
behind
you
and
it
was
in
my
i
never
said
i
why
you
did
you
didn
t
you
said
oh
don
t
go
in
for
accuracy
at
this
house
we
all
exaggerate
and
we
get
very
angry
with
people
who
don
the
scene
is
laid
in
florence
repeated
cecil
with
an
upward
note
lucy
recollected
herself
sunset
leonora
was
speeding
lucy
interrupted
leonora
is
leonora
the
heroine
who
s
the
book
by
joseph
emery
prank
sunset
leonora
speeding
across
the
square
pray
the
saints
she
might
not
arrive
too
late
sunset
the
sunset
of
italy
under
orcagna
s
loggia
the
loggia
de
lanzi
as
we
sometimes
call
it
now
lucy
burst
into
laughter
joseph
emery
prank
indeed
why
it
s
miss
lavish
it
s
miss
lavish
s
novel
and
she
s
publishing
it
under
somebody
else
s
who
may
miss
lavish
be
oh
a
dreadful
person
emerson
you
remember
miss
lavish
excited
by
her
pleasant
afternoon
she
clapped
her
hands
george
looked
up
of
course
i
do
i
saw
her
the
day
i
arrived
at
summer
street
it
was
she
who
told
me
that
you
lived
weren
t
you
pleased
she
meant
to
see
miss
lavish
but
when
he
bent
down
to
the
grass
without
replying
it
struck
her
that
she
could
mean
something
else
she
watched
his
head
which
was
almost
resting
against
her
knee
and
she
thought
that
the
ears
were
reddening
no
wonder
the
novel
s
bad
she
added
i
never
liked
miss
lavish
but
i
suppose
one
ought
to
read
it
as
one
s
met
all
modern
books
are
bad
said
cecil
who
was
annoyed
at
her
inattention
and
vented
his
annoyance
on
literature
every
one
writes
for
money
in
these
oh
cecil
it
is
so
i
will
inflict
joseph
emery
prank
on
you
no
cecil
this
afternoon
seemed
such
a
twittering
sparrow
the
ups
and
downs
in
his
voice
were
noticeable
but
they
did
not
affect
her
she
had
dwelt
amongst
melody
and
movement
and
her
nerves
refused
to
answer
to
the
clang
of
his
leaving
him
to
be
annoyed
she
gazed
at
the
black
head
again
she
did
not
want
to
stroke
it
but
she
saw
herself
wanting
to
stroke
it
the
sensation
was
curious
how
do
you
like
this
view
of
ours
emerson
i
never
notice
much
difference
in
what
do
you
mean
because
they
re
all
alike
because
all
that
matters
in
them
is
distance
and
h
m
said
cecil
uncertain
whether
the
remark
was
striking
or
not
my
father
he
looked
up
at
her
and
he
was
a
little
flushed
says
that
there
is
only
one
perfect
view
the
view
of
the
sky
straight
over
our
heads
and
that
all
these
views
on
earth
are
but
bungled
copies
of
i
expect
your
father
has
been
reading
dante
said
cecil
fingering
the
novel
which
alone
permitted
him
to
lead
the
conversation
he
told
us
another
day
that
views
are
really
crowds
crowds
of
trees
and
houses
and
hills
and
are
bound
to
resemble
each
other
like
human
crowds
and
that
the
power
they
have
over
us
is
sometimes
supernatural
for
the
same
lucy
s
lips
parted
for
a
crowd
is
more
than
the
people
who
make
it
up
something
gets
added
to
it
no
one
knows
how
just
as
something
has
got
added
to
those
he
pointed
with
his
racquet
to
the
south
downs
what
a
splendid
idea
she
murmured
i
shall
enjoy
hearing
your
father
talk
again
i
m
so
sorry
he
s
not
so
no
he
isn
t
there
s
an
absurd
account
of
a
view
in
this
book
said
cecil
also
that
men
fall
into
two
classes
those
who
forget
views
and
those
who
remember
them
even
in
small
mr
emerson
have
you
any
brothers
or
sisters
none
why
you
spoke
of
my
mother
i
was
cecil
closed
the
novel
with
a
bang
oh
cecil
how
you
made
me
jump
i
will
inflict
joseph
emery
prank
on
you
no
i
can
just
remember
us
all
three
going
into
the
country
for
the
day
and
seeing
as
far
as
hindhead
it
is
the
first
thing
that
i
cecil
got
up
the
man
was
he
hadn
t
put
on
his
coat
after
tennis
he
didn
t
do
he
would
have
strolled
away
if
lucy
had
not
stopped
him
cecil
do
read
the
thing
about
the
not
while
emerson
is
here
to
entertain
no
read
away
i
think
nothing
s
funnier
than
to
hear
silly
things
read
out
loud
if
emerson
thinks
us
frivolous
he
can
this
struck
cecil
as
subtle
and
pleased
him
it
put
their
visitor
in
the
position
of
a
prig
somewhat
mollified
he
sat
down
again
mr
emerson
go
and
find
tennis
she
opened
the
book
cecil
must
have
his
reading
and
anything
else
that
he
liked
but
her
attention
wandered
to
george
s
mother
who
according
to
mr
eager
had
been
murdered
in
the
sight
of
god
and
according
to
her
son
had
seen
as
far
as
hindhead
am
i
really
to
go
asked
george
no
of
course
not
really
she
answered
chapter
two
said
cecil
yawning
find
me
chapter
two
if
it
isn
t
bothering
chapter
two
was
found
and
she
glanced
at
its
opening
sentences
she
thought
she
had
gone
mad
here
hand
me
the
she
heard
her
voice
saying
it
isn
t
worth
reading
it
s
too
silly
to
read
i
never
saw
such
rubbish
it
oughtn
t
to
be
allowed
to
be
he
took
the
book
from
her
leonora
he
read
sat
pensive
and
alone
before
her
lay
the
rich
champaign
of
tuscany
dotted
over
with
many
a
smiling
village
the
season
was
miss
lavish
knew
somehow
and
had
printed
the
past
in
draggled
prose
for
cecil
to
read
and
for
george
to
hear
a
golden
haze
he
read
he
read
afar
off
the
towers
of
florence
while
the
bank
on
which
she
sat
was
carpeted
with
violets
all
unobserved
antonio
stole
up
behind
her
lest
cecil
should
see
her
face
she
turned
to
george
and
saw
his
face
he
read
there
came
from
his
lips
no
wordy
protestation
such
as
formal
lovers
use
no
eloquence
was
his
nor
did
he
suffer
from
the
lack
of
it
he
simply
enfolded
her
in
his
manly
this
isn
t
the
passage
i
wanted
he
informed
them
there
is
another
much
funnier
further
he
turned
over
the
leaves
should
we
go
in
to
tea
said
lucy
whose
voice
remained
steady
she
led
the
way
up
the
garden
cecil
following
her
george
last
she
thought
a
disaster
was
averted
but
when
they
entered
the
shrubbery
it
came
the
book
as
if
it
had
not
worked
mischief
enough
had
been
forgotten
and
cecil
must
go
back
for
it
and
george
who
loved
passionately
must
blunder
against
her
in
the
narrow
path
no
she
gasped
and
for
the
second
time
was
kissed
by
him
as
if
no
more
was
possible
he
slipped
back
cecil
rejoined
her
they
reached
the
upper
lawn
alone
chapter
xvi
lying
to
george
but
lucy
had
developed
since
the
spring
that
is
to
say
she
was
now
better
able
to
stifle
the
emotions
of
which
the
conventions
and
the
world
disapprove
though
the
danger
was
greater
she
was
not
shaken
by
deep
sobs
she
said
to
cecil
i
am
not
coming
in
to
tea
tell
mother
i
must
write
some
letters
and
went
up
to
her
room
then
she
prepared
for
action
love
felt
and
returned
love
which
our
bodies
exact
and
our
hearts
have
transfigured
love
which
is
the
most
real
thing
that
we
shall
ever
meet
reappeared
now
as
the
world
s
enemy
and
she
must
stifle
it
she
sent
for
miss
bartlett
the
contest
lay
not
between
love
and
duty
perhaps
there
never
is
such
a
contest
it
lay
between
the
real
and
the
pretended
and
lucy
s
first
aim
was
to
defeat
herself
as
her
brain
clouded
over
as
the
memory
of
the
views
grew
dim
and
the
words
of
the
book
died
away
she
returned
to
her
old
shibboleth
of
nerves
she
conquered
her
tampering
with
the
truth
she
forgot
that
the
truth
had
ever
been
remembering
that
she
was
engaged
to
cecil
she
compelled
herself
to
confused
remembrances
of
george
he
was
nothing
to
her
he
never
had
been
anything
he
had
behaved
abominably
she
had
never
encouraged
him
the
armour
of
falsehood
is
subtly
wrought
out
of
darkness
and
hides
a
man
not
only
from
others
but
from
his
own
soul
in
a
few
moments
lucy
was
equipped
for
battle
something
too
awful
has
happened
she
began
as
soon
as
her
cousin
arrived
do
you
know
anything
about
miss
lavish
s
novel
miss
bartlett
looked
surprised
and
said
that
she
had
not
read
the
book
nor
known
that
it
was
published
eleanor
was
a
reticent
woman
at
heart
there
is
a
scene
in
it
the
hero
and
heroine
make
love
do
you
know
about
that
dear
do
you
know
about
it
please
she
repeated
they
are
on
a
hillside
and
florence
is
in
the
my
good
lucia
i
am
all
at
sea
i
know
nothing
about
it
there
are
violets
i
can
not
believe
it
is
a
coincidence
charlotte
charlotte
how
could
you
have
told
her
i
have
thought
before
speaking
it
must
be
told
her
what
she
asked
with
growing
agitation
about
that
dreadful
afternoon
in
miss
bartlett
was
genuinely
moved
oh
lucy
dearest
girl
she
hasn
t
put
that
in
her
book
lucy
nodded
not
so
that
one
could
recognize
it
then
never
never
never
more
shall
eleanor
lavish
be
a
friend
of
so
you
did
tell
i
did
just
happen
when
i
had
tea
with
her
at
rome
in
the
course
of
conversation
but
charlotte
what
about
the
promise
you
gave
me
when
we
were
packing
why
did
you
tell
miss
lavish
when
you
wouldn
t
even
let
me
tell
mother
i
will
never
forgive
eleanor
she
has
betrayed
my
why
did
you
tell
her
though
this
is
a
most
serious
why
does
any
one
tell
anything
the
question
is
eternal
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
miss
bartlett
should
only
sigh
faintly
in
response
she
had
done
wrong
she
admitted
it
she
only
hoped
that
she
had
not
done
harm
she
had
told
eleanor
in
the
strictest
confidence
lucy
stamped
with
irritation
cecil
happened
to
read
out
the
passage
aloud
to
me
and
to
emerson
it
upset
emerson
and
he
insulted
me
again
behind
cecil
s
back
ugh
is
it
possible
that
men
are
such
brutes
behind
cecil
s
back
as
we
were
walking
up
the
miss
bartlett
burst
into
and
regrets
what
is
to
be
done
now
can
you
tell
me
oh
lucy
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
never
to
my
dying
day
fancy
if
your
prospects
i
know
said
lucy
wincing
at
the
word
i
see
now
why
you
wanted
me
to
tell
cecil
and
what
you
meant
by
some
other
you
knew
that
you
had
told
miss
lavish
and
that
she
was
not
it
was
miss
bartlett
s
turn
to
wince
however
said
the
girl
despising
her
cousin
s
shiftiness
what
s
done
s
done
you
have
put
me
in
a
most
awkward
position
how
am
i
to
get
out
of
it
miss
bartlett
could
not
think
the
days
of
her
energy
were
over
she
was
a
visitor
not
a
chaperon
and
a
discredited
visitor
at
that
she
stood
with
clasped
hands
while
the
girl
worked
herself
into
the
necessary
rage
he
must
that
man
must
have
such
a
setting
down
that
he
won
t
forget
and
who
s
to
give
it
him
i
can
t
tell
mother
now
owing
to
you
nor
cecil
charlotte
owing
to
you
i
am
caught
up
every
way
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
i
have
no
one
to
help
me
that
s
why
i
ve
sent
for
you
what
s
wanted
is
a
man
with
a
miss
bartlett
agreed
one
wanted
a
man
with
a
whip
yes
but
it
s
no
good
agreeing
what
s
to
be
done
we
women
go
maundering
on
what
does
a
girl
do
when
she
comes
across
a
cad
i
always
said
he
was
a
cad
dear
give
me
credit
for
that
at
all
events
from
the
very
first
moment
when
he
said
his
father
was
having
a
oh
bother
the
credit
and
who
s
been
right
or
wrong
we
ve
both
made
a
muddle
of
it
george
emerson
is
still
down
the
garden
there
and
is
he
to
be
left
unpunished
or
isn
t
he
i
want
to
miss
bartlett
was
absolutely
helpless
her
own
exposure
had
unnerved
her
and
thoughts
were
colliding
painfully
in
her
brain
she
moved
feebly
to
the
window
and
tried
to
detect
the
cad
s
white
flannels
among
the
laurels
you
were
ready
enough
at
the
bertolini
when
you
rushed
me
off
to
rome
can
t
you
speak
again
to
him
now
willingly
would
i
move
heaven
and
earth
i
want
something
more
definite
said
lucy
contemptuously
will
you
speak
to
him
it
is
the
least
you
can
do
surely
considering
it
all
happened
because
you
broke
your
never
again
shall
eleanor
lavish
be
a
friend
of
really
charlotte
was
outdoing
herself
yes
or
no
please
yes
or
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
only
a
gentleman
can
george
emerson
was
coming
up
the
garden
with
a
tennis
ball
in
his
hand
very
well
said
lucy
with
an
angry
gesture
no
one
will
help
me
i
will
speak
to
him
and
immediately
she
realized
that
this
was
what
her
cousin
had
intended
all
along
hullo
emerson
called
freddy
from
below
found
the
lost
ball
good
man
want
any
tea
and
there
was
an
irruption
from
the
house
on
to
the
terrace
oh
lucy
but
that
is
brave
of
you
i
admire
you
they
had
gathered
round
george
who
beckoned
she
felt
over
the
rubbish
the
sloppy
thoughts
the
furtive
yearnings
that
were
beginning
to
cumber
her
soul
her
anger
faded
at
the
sight
of
him
ah
the
emersons
were
fine
people
in
their
way
she
had
to
subdue
a
rush
in
her
blood
before
saying
freddy
has
taken
him
into
the
the
others
are
going
down
the
garden
come
let
us
get
this
over
quickly
come
i
want
you
in
the
room
of
lucy
do
you
mind
doing
it
how
can
you
ask
such
a
ridiculous
question
poor
lucy
she
stretched
out
her
hand
i
seem
to
bring
nothing
but
misfortune
wherever
i
lucy
nodded
she
remembered
their
last
evening
at
florence
the
packing
the
candle
the
shadow
of
miss
bartlett
s
toque
on
the
door
she
was
not
to
be
trapped
by
pathos
a
second
time
eluding
her
cousin
s
caress
she
led
the
way
downstairs
try
the
jam
freddy
was
saying
the
jam
s
jolly
george
looking
big
and
dishevelled
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
as
she
entered
he
stopped
and
said
no
nothing
to
you
go
down
to
the
others
said
lucy
charlotte
and
i
will
give
emerson
all
he
wants
where
s
mother
she
s
started
on
her
sunday
writing
she
s
in
the
that
s
all
right
you
go
he
went
off
singing
lucy
sat
down
at
the
table
miss
bartlett
who
was
thoroughly
frightened
took
up
a
book
and
pretended
to
read
she
would
not
be
drawn
into
an
elaborate
speech
she
just
said
i
can
t
have
it
emerson
i
can
not
even
talk
to
you
go
out
of
this
house
and
never
come
into
it
again
as
long
as
i
live
here
flushing
as
she
spoke
and
pointing
to
the
door
i
hate
a
row
go
what
no
but
i
can
t
she
shook
her
head
go
please
i
do
not
want
to
call
in
you
don
t
mean
he
said
absolutely
ignoring
miss
bartlett
you
don
t
mean
that
you
are
going
to
marry
that
man
the
line
was
unexpected
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
his
vulgarity
wearied
her
you
are
merely
ridiculous
she
said
quietly
then
his
words
rose
gravely
over
hers
you
can
not
live
with
vyse
he
s
only
for
an
acquaintance
he
is
for
society
and
cultivated
talk
he
should
know
no
one
intimately
least
of
all
a
it
was
a
new
light
on
cecil
s
character
have
you
ever
talked
to
vyse
without
feeling
tired
i
can
scarcely
discuss
no
but
have
you
ever
he
is
the
sort
who
are
all
right
so
long
as
they
keep
to
things
books
pictures
but
kill
when
they
come
to
people
that
s
why
i
ll
speak
out
through
all
this
muddle
even
now
it
s
shocking
enough
to
lose
you
in
any
case
but
generally
a
man
must
deny
himself
joy
and
i
would
have
held
back
if
your
cecil
had
been
a
different
person
i
would
never
have
let
myself
go
but
i
saw
him
first
in
the
national
gallery
when
he
winced
because
my
father
mispronounced
the
names
of
great
painters
then
he
brings
us
here
and
we
find
it
is
to
play
some
silly
trick
on
a
kind
neighbour
that
is
the
man
all
over
playing
tricks
on
people
on
the
most
sacred
form
of
life
that
he
can
find
next
i
meet
you
together
and
find
him
protecting
and
teaching
you
and
your
mother
to
be
shocked
when
it
was
for
you
to
settle
whether
you
were
shocked
or
no
cecil
all
over
again
he
daren
t
let
a
woman
decide
he
s
the
type
who
s
kept
europe
back
for
a
thousand
years
every
moment
of
his
life
he
s
forming
you
telling
you
what
s
charming
or
amusing
or
ladylike
telling
you
what
a
man
thinks
womanly
and
you
you
of
all
women
listen
to
his
voice
instead
of
to
your
own
so
it
was
at
the
rectory
when
i
met
you
both
again
so
it
has
been
the
whole
of
this
afternoon
therefore
not
therefore
i
kissed
you
because
the
book
made
me
do
that
and
i
wish
to
goodness
i
had
more
i
m
not
ashamed
i
don
t
apologize
but
it
has
frightened
you
and
you
may
not
have
noticed
that
i
love
you
or
would
you
have
told
me
to
go
and
dealt
with
a
tremendous
thing
so
lightly
but
therefore
therefore
i
settled
to
fight
lucy
thought
of
a
very
good
remark
you
say
vyse
wants
me
to
listen
to
him
emerson
pardon
me
for
suggesting
that
you
have
caught
the
and
he
took
the
shoddy
reproof
and
touched
it
into
immortality
he
said
yes
i
have
and
sank
down
as
if
suddenly
weary
i
m
the
same
kind
of
brute
at
bottom
this
desire
to
govern
a
woman
it
lies
very
deep
and
men
and
women
must
fight
it
together
before
they
shall
enter
the
garden
but
i
do
love
you
surely
in
a
better
way
than
he
he
thought
yes
really
in
a
better
way
i
want
you
to
have
your
own
thoughts
even
when
i
hold
you
in
my
he
stretched
them
towards
her
lucy
be
quick
there
s
no
time
for
us
to
talk
now
come
to
me
as
you
came
in
the
spring
and
afterwards
i
will
be
gentle
and
explain
i
have
cared
for
you
since
that
man
died
i
can
not
live
without
you
no
good
i
thought
she
is
marrying
someone
else
but
i
meet
you
again
when
all
the
world
is
glorious
water
and
sun
as
you
came
through
the
wood
i
saw
that
nothing
else
mattered
i
called
i
wanted
to
live
and
have
my
chance
of
and
vyse
said
lucy
who
kept
commendably
calm
does
he
not
matter
that
i
love
cecil
and
shall
be
his
wife
shortly
a
detail
of
no
importance
i
suppose
but
he
stretched
his
arms
over
the
table
towards
her
may
i
ask
what
you
intend
to
gain
by
this
exhibition
he
said
it
is
our
last
chance
i
shall
do
all
that
i
and
as
if
he
had
done
all
else
he
turned
to
miss
bartlett
who
sat
like
some
portent
against
the
skies
of
the
evening
you
wouldn
t
stop
us
this
second
time
if
you
understood
he
said
i
have
been
into
the
dark
and
i
am
going
back
into
it
unless
you
will
try
to
her
long
narrow
head
drove
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
demolishing
some
invisible
obstacle
she
did
not
answer
it
is
being
young
he
said
quietly
picking
up
his
racquet
from
the
floor
and
preparing
to
go
it
is
being
certain
that
lucy
cares
for
me
really
it
is
that
love
and
youth
matter
in
silence
the
two
women
watched
him
his
last
remark
they
knew
was
nonsense
but
was
he
going
after
it
or
not
would
not
he
the
cad
the
charlatan
attempt
a
more
dramatic
finish
no
he
was
apparently
content
he
left
them
carefully
closing
the
front
door
and
when
they
looked
through
the
hall
window
they
saw
him
go
up
the
drive
and
begin
to
climb
the
slopes
of
withered
fern
behind
the
house
their
tongues
were
loosed
and
they
burst
into
stealthy
rejoicings
oh
lucia
come
back
here
oh
what
an
awful
man
lucy
had
no
reaction
at
least
not
yet
well
he
amuses
me
she
said
either
i
m
mad
or
else
he
is
and
i
m
inclined
to
think
it
s
the
latter
one
more
fuss
through
with
you
charlotte
many
thanks
i
think
though
that
this
is
the
last
my
admirer
will
hardly
trouble
me
and
miss
bartlett
too
essayed
the
roguish
well
it
isn
t
everyone
who
could
boast
such
a
conquest
dearest
is
it
oh
one
oughtn
t
to
laugh
really
it
might
have
been
very
serious
but
you
were
so
sensible
and
brave
so
unlike
the
girls
of
my
let
s
go
down
to
but
once
in
the
open
air
she
paused
some
emotion
pity
terror
love
but
the
emotion
was
strong
seized
her
and
she
was
aware
of
autumn
summer
was
ending
and
the
evening
brought
her
odours
of
decay
the
more
pathetic
because
they
were
reminiscent
of
spring
that
something
or
other
mattered
intellectually
a
leaf
violently
agitated
danced
past
her
while
other
leaves
lay
motionless
that
the
earth
was
hastening
to
darkness
and
the
shadows
of
those
trees
over
windy
corner
hullo
lucy
there
s
still
light
enough
for
another
set
if
you
two
ll
mr
emerson
has
had
to
what
a
nuisance
that
spoils
the
four
i
say
cecil
do
play
do
there
s
a
good
chap
it
s
floyd
s
last
day
do
play
tennis
with
us
just
this
cecil
s
voice
came
my
dear
freddy
i
am
no
athlete
as
you
well
remarked
this
very
morning
there
are
some
chaps
who
are
no
good
for
anything
but
books
i
plead
guilty
to
being
such
a
chap
and
will
not
inflict
myself
on
the
scales
fell
from
lucy
s
eyes
how
had
she
stood
cecil
for
a
moment
he
was
absolutely
intolerable
and
the
same
evening
she
broke
off
her
engagement
chapter
xvii
lying
to
cecil
he
was
bewildered
he
had
nothing
to
say
he
was
not
even
angry
but
stood
with
a
glass
of
whiskey
between
his
hands
trying
to
think
what
had
led
her
to
such
a
conclusion
she
had
chosen
the
moment
before
bed
when
in
accordance
with
their
bourgeois
habit
she
always
dispensed
drinks
to
the
men
freddy
and
floyd
were
sure
to
retire
with
their
glasses
while
cecil
invariably
lingered
sipping
at
his
while
she
locked
up
the
sideboard
i
am
very
sorry
about
it
she
said
i
have
carefully
thought
things
over
we
are
too
different
i
must
ask
you
to
release
me
and
try
to
forget
that
there
ever
was
such
a
foolish
it
was
a
suitable
speech
but
she
was
more
angry
than
sorry
and
her
voice
showed
it
different
how
how
i
haven
t
had
a
really
good
education
for
one
thing
she
continued
still
on
her
knees
by
the
sideboard
my
italian
trip
came
too
late
and
i
am
forgetting
all
that
i
learnt
there
i
shall
never
be
able
to
talk
to
your
friends
or
behave
as
a
wife
of
yours
i
don
t
understand
you
you
aren
t
like
yourself
you
re
tired
tired
she
retorted
kindling
at
once
that
is
exactly
like
you
you
always
think
women
don
t
mean
what
they
well
you
sound
tired
as
if
something
has
worried
what
if
i
do
it
doesn
t
prevent
me
from
realizing
the
truth
i
can
t
marry
you
and
you
will
thank
me
for
saying
so
some
you
had
that
bad
headache
yesterday
all
right
for
she
had
exclaimed
indignantly
i
see
it
s
much
more
than
headaches
but
give
me
a
moment
s
he
closed
his
eyes
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
say
stupid
things
but
my
brain
has
gone
to
pieces
part
of
it
lives
three
minutes
back
when
i
was
sure
that
you
loved
me
and
the
other
part
i
find
it
difficult
i
am
likely
to
say
the
wrong
it
struck
her
that
he
was
not
behaving
so
badly
and
her
irritation
increased
she
again
desired
a
struggle
not
a
discussion
to
bring
on
the
crisis
she
said
there
are
days
when
one
sees
clearly
and
this
is
one
of
them
things
must
come
to
a
some
time
and
it
happens
to
be
if
you
want
to
know
quite
a
little
thing
decided
me
to
speak
to
you
when
you
wouldn
t
play
tennis
with
i
never
do
play
tennis
said
cecil
painfully
bewildered
i
never
could
play
i
don
t
understand
a
word
you
you
can
play
well
enough
to
make
up
a
four
i
thought
it
abominably
selfish
of
no
i
can
t
well
never
mind
the
tennis
why
couldn
t
you
couldn
t
you
have
warned
me
if
you
felt
anything
wrong
you
talked
of
our
wedding
at
lunch
at
least
you
let
me
i
knew
you
wouldn
t
understand
said
lucy
quite
crossly
i
might
have
known
there
would
have
been
these
dreadful
explanations
of
course
it
isn
t
the
tennis
that
was
only
the
last
straw
to
all
i
have
been
feeling
for
weeks
surely
it
was
better
not
to
speak
until
i
felt
she
developed
this
position
often
before
i
have
wondered
if
i
was
fitted
for
your
wife
for
instance
in
london
and
are
you
fitted
to
be
my
husband
i
don
t
think
so
you
don
t
like
freddy
nor
my
mother
there
was
always
a
lot
against
our
engagement
cecil
but
all
our
relations
seemed
pleased
and
we
met
so
often
and
it
was
no
good
mentioning
it
until
well
until
all
things
came
to
a
point
they
have
i
see
clearly
i
must
speak
that
s
i
can
not
think
you
were
right
said
cecil
gently
i
can
not
tell
why
but
though
all
that
you
say
sounds
true
i
feel
that
you
are
not
treating
me
fairly
it
s
all
too
what
s
the
good
of
a
scene
no
good
but
surely
i
have
a
right
to
hear
a
little
he
put
down
his
glass
and
opened
the
window
from
where
she
knelt
jangling
her
keys
she
could
see
a
slit
of
darkness
and
peering
into
it
as
if
it
would
tell
him
that
little
more
his
long
thoughtful
face
don
t
open
the
window
and
you
d
better
draw
the
curtain
too

or
any
one
might
be
he
obeyed
i
really
think
we
had
better
go
to
bed
if
you
don
t
mind
i
shall
only
say
things
that
will
make
me
unhappy
afterwards
as
you
say
it
is
all
too
horrible
and
it
is
no
good
but
to
cecil
now
that
he
was
about
to
lose
her
she
seemed
each
moment
more
desirable
he
looked
at
her
instead
of
through
her
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
engaged
from
a
leonardo
she
had
become
a
living
woman
with
mysteries
and
forces
of
her
own
with
qualities
that
even
eluded
art
his
brain
recovered
from
the
shock
and
in
a
burst
of
genuine
devotion
he
cried
but
i
love
you
and
i
did
think
you
loved
me
i
did
not
she
said
i
thought
i
did
at
first
i
am
sorry
and
ought
to
have
refused
you
this
last
time
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
and
she
grew
more
and
more
vexed
at
his
dignified
behaviour
she
had
counted
on
his
being
petty
it
would
have
made
things
easier
for
her
by
a
cruel
irony
she
was
drawing
out
all
that
was
finest
in
his
disposition
you
don
t
love
me
evidently
i
dare
say
you
are
right
not
to
but
it
would
hurt
a
little
less
if
i
knew
because
a
phrase
came
to
her
and
she
accepted
it
you
re
the
sort
who
can
t
know
any
one
a
horrified
look
came
into
his
eyes
i
don
t
mean
exactly
that
but
you
will
question
me
though
i
beg
you
not
to
and
i
must
say
something
it
is
that
more
or
less
when
we
were
only
acquaintances
you
let
me
be
myself
but
now
you
re
always
protecting
her
voice
swelled
i
won
t
be
protected
i
will
choose
for
myself
what
is
ladylike
and
right
to
shield
me
is
an
insult
can
t
i
be
trusted
to
face
the
truth
but
i
must
get
it
through
you
a
woman
s
place
you
despise
my
mother
i
know
you
do
because
she
s
conventional
and
bothers
over
puddings
but
oh
goodness
she
rose
to
her
feet
conventional
cecil
you
re
that
for
you
may
understand
beautiful
things
but
you
don
t
know
how
to
use
them
and
you
wrap
yourself
up
in
art
and
books
and
music
and
would
try
to
wrap
up
me
i
won
t
be
stifled
not
by
the
most
glorious
music
for
people
are
more
glorious
and
you
hide
them
from
me
that
s
why
i
break
off
my
engagement
you
were
all
right
as
long
as
you
kept
to
things
but
when
you
came
to
people
she
stopped
there
was
a
pause
then
cecil
said
with
great
emotion
it
is
true
on
the
whole
she
corrected
full
of
some
vague
shame
true
every
word
it
is
a
revelation
it
is
anyhow
those
are
my
reasons
for
not
being
your
he
repeated
the
sort
that
can
know
no
one
it
is
true
i
fell
to
pieces
the
very
first
day
we
were
engaged
i
behaved
like
a
cad
to
beebe
and
to
your
brother
you
are
even
greater
than
i
she
withdrew
a
step
i
m
not
going
to
worry
you
you
are
far
too
good
to
me
i
shall
never
forget
your
insight
and
dear
i
only
blame
you
for
this
you
might
have
warned
me
in
the
early
stages
before
you
felt
you
wouldn
t
marry
me
and
so
have
given
me
a
chance
to
improve
i
have
never
known
you
till
this
evening
i
have
just
used
you
as
a
peg
for
my
silly
notions
of
what
a
woman
should
be
but
this
evening
you
are
a
different
person
new
thoughts
even
a
new
voice
what
do
you
mean
by
a
new
voice
she
asked
seized
with
incontrollable
anger
i
mean
that
a
new
person
seems
speaking
through
you
said
he
then
she
lost
her
balance
she
cried
if
you
think
i
am
in
love
with
someone
else
you
are
very
much
of
course
i
don
t
think
that
you
are
not
that
kind
oh
yes
you
do
think
it
it
s
your
old
idea
the
idea
that
has
kept
europe
back
i
mean
the
idea
that
women
are
always
thinking
of
men
if
a
girl
breaks
off
her
engagement
everyone
says
oh
she
had
some
one
else
in
her
mind
she
hopes
to
get
someone
it
s
disgusting
brutal
as
if
a
girl
can
t
break
it
off
for
the
sake
of
he
answered
reverently
i
may
have
said
that
in
the
past
i
shall
never
say
it
again
you
have
taught
me
she
began
to
redden
and
pretended
to
examine
the
windows
again
of
course
there
is
no
question
of
someone
else
in
this
no
jilting
or
any
such
nauseous
stupidity
i
beg
your
pardon
most
humbly
if
my
words
suggested
that
there
was
i
only
meant
that
there
was
a
force
in
you
that
i
hadn
t
known
of
up
till
all
right
cecil
that
will
do
don
t
apologize
to
me
it
was
my
it
is
a
question
between
ideals
yours
and
mine
pure
abstract
ideals
and
yours
are
the
nobler
i
was
bound
up
in
the
old
vicious
notions
and
all
the
time
you
were
splendid
and
his
voice
broke
i
must
actually
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
showing
me
what
i
really
am
solemnly
i
thank
you
for
showing
me
a
true
woman
will
you
shake
hands
of
course
i
will
said
lucy
twisting
up
her
other
hand
in
the
curtains
cecil
that
s
all
right
i
m
sorry
about
it
thank
you
very
much
for
your
let
me
light
your
candle
shall
i
they
went
into
the
hall
thank
you
again
god
bless
you
lucy
she
watched
him
steal
while
the
shadows
from
three
banisters
passed
over
her
face
like
the
beat
of
wings
on
the
landing
he
paused
strong
in
his
renunciation
and
gave
her
a
look
of
memorable
beauty
for
all
his
culture
cecil
was
an
ascetic
at
heart
and
nothing
in
his
love
became
him
like
the
leaving
of
it
she
could
never
marry
in
the
tumult
of
her
soul
that
stood
firm
cecil
believed
in
her
she
must
some
day
believe
in
herself
she
must
be
one
of
the
women
whom
she
had
praised
so
eloquently
who
care
for
liberty
and
not
for
men
she
must
forget
that
george
loved
her
that
george
had
been
thinking
through
her
and
gained
her
this
honourable
release
that
george
had
gone
away
into
what
was
it
the
darkness
she
put
out
the
lamp
it
did
not
do
to
think
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
to
feel
she
gave
up
trying
to
understand
herself
and
joined
the
vast
armies
of
the
benighted
who
follow
neither
the
heart
nor
the
brain
and
march
to
their
destiny
by
the
armies
are
full
of
pleasant
and
pious
folk
but
they
have
yielded
to
the
only
enemy
that
matters
the
enemy
within
they
have
sinned
against
passion
and
truth
and
vain
will
be
their
strife
after
virtue
as
the
years
pass
they
are
censured
their
pleasantry
and
their
piety
show
cracks
their
wit
becomes
cynicism
their
unselfishness
hypocrisy
they
feel
and
produce
discomfort
wherever
they
go
they
have
sinned
against
eros
and
against
pallas
athene
and
not
by
any
heavenly
intervention
but
by
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
those
allied
deities
will
be
avenged
lucy
entered
this
army
when
she
pretended
to
george
that
she
did
not
love
him
and
pretended
to
cecil
that
she
loved
no
one
the
night
received
her
as
it
had
received
miss
bartlett
thirty
years
before
chapter
xviii
lying
to
beebe
honeychurch
freddy
and
the
servants
windy
corner
lay
not
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
but
a
few
hundred
feet
down
the
southern
slope
at
the
springing
of
one
of
the
great
buttresses
that
supported
the
hill
on
either
side
of
it
was
a
shallow
ravine
filled
with
ferns
and
and
down
the
ravine
on
the
left
ran
the
highway
into
the
weald
whenever
beebe
crossed
the
ridge
and
caught
sight
of
these
noble
dispositions
of
the
earth
and
poised
in
the
middle
of
them
windy
corner
he
laughed
the
situation
was
so
glorious
the
house
so
commonplace
not
to
say
impertinent
the
late
honeychurch
had
affected
the
cube
because
it
gave
him
the
most
accommodation
for
his
money
and
the
only
addition
made
by
his
widow
had
been
a
small
turret
shaped
like
a
rhinoceros
horn
where
she
could
sit
in
wet
weather
and
watch
the
carts
going
up
and
down
the
road
so
impertinent
and
yet
the
house
did
for
it
was
the
home
of
people
who
loved
their
surroundings
honestly
other
houses
in
the
neighborhood
had
been
built
by
expensive
architects
over
others
their
inmates
had
fidgeted
sedulously
yet
all
these
suggested
the
accidental
the
temporary
while
windy
corner
seemed
as
inevitable
as
an
ugliness
of
nature
s
own
creation
one
might
laugh
at
the
house
but
one
never
shuddered
beebe
was
bicycling
over
this
monday
afternoon
with
a
piece
of
gossip
he
had
heard
from
the
miss
alans
these
admirable
ladies
since
they
could
not
go
to
cissie
villa
had
changed
their
plans
they
were
going
to
greece
instead
since
florence
did
my
poor
sister
so
much
good
wrote
miss
catharine
we
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
try
athens
this
winter
of
course
athens
is
a
plunge
and
the
doctor
has
ordered
her
special
digestive
bread
but
after
all
we
can
take
that
with
us
and
it
is
only
getting
first
into
a
steamer
and
then
into
a
train
but
is
there
an
english
church
and
the
letter
went
on
to
say
i
do
not
expect
we
shall
go
any
further
than
athens
but
if
you
knew
of
a
really
comfortable
pension
at
constantinople
we
should
be
so
lucy
would
enjoy
this
letter
and
the
smile
with
which
beebe
greeted
windy
corner
was
partly
for
her
she
would
see
the
fun
of
it
and
some
of
its
beauty
for
she
must
see
some
beauty
though
she
was
hopeless
about
pictures
and
though
she
dressed
so
unevenly
oh
that
cerise
frock
yesterday
at
church
she
must
see
some
beauty
in
life
or
she
could
not
play
the
piano
as
she
did
he
had
a
theory
that
musicians
are
incredibly
complex
and
know
far
less
than
other
artists
what
they
want
and
what
they
are
that
they
puzzle
themselves
as
well
as
their
friends
that
their
psychology
is
a
modern
development
and
has
not
yet
been
understood
this
theory
had
he
known
it
had
possibly
just
been
illustrated
by
facts
ignorant
of
the
events
of
yesterday
he
was
only
riding
over
to
get
some
tea
to
see
his
niece
and
to
observe
whether
miss
honeychurch
saw
anything
beautiful
in
the
desire
of
two
old
ladies
to
visit
athens
a
carriage
was
drawn
up
outside
windy
corner
and
just
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
house
it
started
bowled
up
the
drive
and
stopped
abruptly
when
it
reached
the
main
road
therefore
it
must
be
the
horse
who
always
expected
people
to
walk
up
the
hill
in
case
they
tired
him
the
door
opened
obediently
and
two
men
emerged
whom
beebe
recognized
as
cecil
and
freddy
they
were
an
odd
couple
to
go
driving
but
he
saw
a
trunk
beside
the
coachman
s
legs
cecil
who
wore
a
bowler
must
be
going
away
while
freddy
a
cap
was
seeing
him
to
the
station
they
walked
rapidly
taking
the
short
cuts
and
reached
the
summit
while
the
carriage
was
still
pursuing
the
windings
of
the
road
they
shook
hands
with
the
clergyman
but
did
not
speak
so
you
re
off
for
a
minute
vyse
he
asked
cecil
said
yes
while
freddy
edged
away
i
was
coming
to
show
you
this
delightful
letter
from
those
friends
of
miss
he
quoted
from
it
isn
t
it
wonderful
isn
t
it
romance
most
certainly
they
will
go
to
constantinople
they
are
taken
in
a
snare
that
can
not
fail
they
will
end
by
going
round
the
cecil
listened
civilly
and
said
he
was
sure
that
lucy
would
be
amused
and
interested
isn
t
romance
capricious
i
never
notice
it
in
you
young
people
you
do
nothing
but
play
lawn
tennis
and
say
that
romance
is
dead
while
the
miss
alans
are
struggling
with
all
the
weapons
of
propriety
against
the
terrible
thing
a
really
comfortable
pension
at
constantinople
so
they
call
it
out
of
decency
but
in
their
hearts
they
want
a
pension
with
magic
windows
opening
on
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
fairyland
forlorn
no
ordinary
view
will
content
the
miss
alans
they
want
the
pension
i
m
awfully
sorry
to
interrupt
beebe
said
freddy
but
have
you
any
matches
i
have
said
cecil
and
it
did
not
escape
beebe
s
notice
that
he
spoke
to
the
boy
more
kindly
you
have
never
met
these
miss
alans
have
you
vyse
then
you
don
t
see
the
wonder
of
this
greek
visit
i
haven
t
been
to
greece
myself
and
don
t
mean
to
go
and
i
can
t
imagine
any
of
my
friends
going
it
is
altogether
too
big
for
our
little
lot
don
t
you
think
so
italy
is
just
about
as
much
as
we
can
manage
italy
is
heroic
but
greece
is
godlike
or
devilish
i
am
not
sure
which
and
in
either
case
absolutely
out
of
our
suburban
focus
all
right
freddy
i
am
not
being
clever
upon
my
word
i
am
not
i
took
the
idea
from
another
fellow
and
give
me
those
matches
when
you
ve
done
with
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
on
talking
to
the
two
young
men
i
was
saying
if
our
poor
little
cockney
lives
must
have
a
background
let
it
be
italian
big
enough
in
all
conscience
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel
for
me
there
the
contrast
is
just
as
much
as
i
can
realize
but
not
the
parthenon
not
the
frieze
of
phidias
at
any
price
and
here
comes
the
you
re
quite
right
said
cecil
greece
is
not
for
our
little
lot
and
he
got
in
freddy
followed
nodding
to
the
clergyman
whom
he
trusted
not
to
be
pulling
one
s
leg
really
and
before
they
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
he
jumped
out
and
came
running
back
for
vyse
s
which
had
not
been
returned
as
he
took
it
he
said
i
m
so
glad
you
only
talked
about
books
cecil
s
hard
hit
lucy
won
t
marry
him
if
you
d
gone
on
about
her
as
you
did
about
them
he
might
have
broken
but
when
late
last
night
i
must
perhaps
they
won
t
want
me
down
no
go
on
thank
goodness
exclaimed
beebe
to
himself
and
struck
the
saddle
of
his
bicycle
approvingly
it
was
the
one
foolish
thing
she
ever
did
oh
what
a
glorious
riddance
and
after
a
little
thought
he
negotiated
the
slope
into
windy
corner
light
of
heart
the
house
was
again
as
it
ought
to
be
cut
off
forever
from
cecil
s
pretentious
world
he
would
find
miss
minnie
down
in
the
garden
in
the
lucy
was
tinkling
at
a
mozart
sonata
he
hesitated
a
moment
but
went
down
the
garden
as
requested
there
he
found
a
mournful
company
it
was
a
blustering
day
and
the
wind
had
taken
and
broken
the
dahlias
honeychurch
who
looked
cross
was
tying
them
up
while
miss
bartlett
unsuitably
dressed
impeded
her
with
offers
of
assistance
at
a
little
distance
stood
minnie
and
the
a
minute
importation
each
holding
either
end
of
a
long
piece
of
bass
oh
how
do
you
do
beebe
gracious
what
a
mess
everything
is
look
at
my
scarlet
pompoms
and
the
wind
blowing
your
skirts
about
and
the
ground
so
hard
that
not
a
prop
will
stick
in
and
then
the
carriage
having
to
go
out
when
i
had
counted
on
having
powell
who
give
every
one
their
due
does
tie
up
dahlias
evidently
honeychurch
was
shattered
how
do
you
do
said
miss
bartlett
with
a
meaning
glance
as
though
conveying
that
more
than
dahlias
had
been
broken
off
by
the
autumn
gales
here
lennie
the
bass
cried
honeychurch
the
who
did
not
know
what
bass
was
stood
rooted
to
the
path
with
horror
minnie
slipped
to
her
uncle
and
whispered
that
everyone
was
very
disagreeable
and
that
it
was
not
her
fault
if
would
tear
longways
instead
of
across
come
for
a
walk
with
me
he
told
her
you
have
worried
them
as
much
as
they
can
stand
honeychurch
i
only
called
in
aimlessly
i
shall
take
her
up
to
tea
at
the
beehive
tavern
if
i
oh
must
you
yes
not
the
scissors
thank
you
charlotte
when
both
my
hands
are
full
already
i
m
perfectly
certain
that
the
orange
cactus
will
go
before
i
can
get
to
beebe
who
was
an
adept
at
relieving
situations
invited
miss
bartlett
to
accompany
them
to
this
mild
festivity
yes
charlotte
i
don
t
want
you
do
go
there
s
nothing
to
stop
about
for
either
in
the
house
or
out
of
miss
bartlett
said
that
her
duty
lay
in
the
dahlia
bed
but
when
she
had
exasperated
everyone
except
minnie
by
a
refusal
she
turned
round
and
exasperated
minnie
by
an
acceptance
as
they
walked
up
the
garden
the
orange
cactus
fell
and
beebe
s
last
vision
was
of
the
clasping
it
like
a
lover
his
dark
head
buried
in
a
wealth
of
blossom
it
is
terrible
this
havoc
among
the
flowers
he
remarked
it
is
always
terrible
when
the
promise
of
months
is
destroyed
in
a
moment
enunciated
miss
bartlett
perhaps
we
ought
to
send
miss
honeychurch
down
to
her
mother
or
will
she
come
with
us
i
think
we
had
better
leave
lucy
to
herself
and
to
her
own
they
re
angry
with
miss
honeychurch
because
she
was
late
for
breakfast
whispered
minnie
and
floyd
has
gone
and
vyse
has
gone
and
freddy
won
t
play
with
me
in
fact
uncle
arthur
the
house
is
not
at
all
what
it
was
don
t
be
a
prig
said
her
uncle
arthur
go
and
put
on
your
he
stepped
into
the
where
lucy
was
still
attentively
pursuing
the
sonatas
of
mozart
she
stopped
when
he
entered
how
do
you
do
miss
bartlett
and
minnie
are
coming
with
me
to
tea
at
the
beehive
would
you
come
too
i
don
t
think
i
will
thank
no
i
didn
t
suppose
you
would
care
to
lucy
turned
to
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
chords
how
delicate
those
sonatas
are
said
beebe
though
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
thought
them
silly
little
things
lucy
passed
into
schumann
miss
honeychurch
i
met
them
on
the
hill
your
brother
told
oh
he
did
she
sounded
annoyed
beebe
felt
hurt
for
he
had
thought
that
she
would
like
him
to
be
told
i
needn
t
say
that
it
will
go
no
mother
charlotte
cecil
freddy
you
said
lucy
playing
a
note
for
each
person
who
knew
and
then
playing
a
sixth
note
if
you
ll
let
me
say
so
i
am
very
glad
and
i
am
certain
that
you
have
done
the
right
so
i
hoped
other
people
would
think
but
they
don
t
seem
i
could
see
that
miss
bartlett
thought
it
so
does
mother
mother
minds
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
said
beebe
with
feeling
honeychurch
who
hated
all
changes
did
mind
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
her
daughter
pretended
and
only
for
the
minute
it
was
really
a
ruse
of
lucy
s
to
justify
her
despondency
a
ruse
of
which
she
was
not
herself
conscious
for
she
was
marching
in
the
armies
of
darkness
and
freddy
still
freddy
never
hit
it
off
with
vyse
much
did
he
i
gathered
that
he
disliked
the
engagement
and
felt
it
might
separate
him
from
boys
are
so
minnie
could
be
heard
arguing
with
miss
bartlett
through
the
floor
tea
at
the
beehive
apparently
involved
a
complete
change
of
apparel
beebe
saw
that
lucy
very
properly
did
not
wish
to
discuss
her
action
so
after
a
sincere
expression
of
sympathy
he
said
i
have
had
an
absurd
letter
from
miss
alan
that
was
really
what
brought
me
over
i
thought
it
might
amuse
you
how
delightful
said
lucy
in
a
dull
voice
for
the
sake
of
something
to
do
he
began
to
read
her
the
letter
after
a
few
words
her
eyes
grew
alert
and
soon
she
interrupted
him
with
going
abroad
when
do
they
start
next
week
i
did
freddy
say
whether
he
was
driving
straight
back
no
he
didn
because
i
do
hope
he
won
t
go
so
she
did
want
to
talk
about
her
broken
engagement
always
complaisant
he
put
the
letter
away
but
she
at
once
exclaimed
in
a
high
voice
oh
do
tell
me
more
about
the
miss
alans
how
perfectly
splendid
of
them
to
go
abroad
i
want
them
to
start
from
venice
and
go
in
a
cargo
steamer
down
the
illyrian
coast
she
laughed
heartily
oh
delightful
i
wish
they
d
take
has
italy
filled
you
with
the
fever
of
travel
perhaps
george
emerson
is
right
he
says
that
italy
is
only
an
euphuism
for
oh
not
italy
but
constantinople
i
have
always
longed
to
go
to
constantinople
constantinople
is
practically
asia
isn
t
it
beebe
reminded
her
that
constantinople
was
still
unlikely
and
that
the
miss
alans
only
aimed
at
athens
with
delphi
perhaps
if
the
roads
are
but
this
made
no
difference
to
her
enthusiasm
she
had
always
longed
to
go
to
greece
even
more
it
seemed
he
saw
to
his
surprise
that
she
was
apparently
serious
i
didn
t
realize
that
you
and
the
miss
alans
were
still
such
friends
after
cissie
oh
that
s
nothing
i
assure
you
cissie
villa
s
nothing
to
me
i
would
give
anything
to
go
with
would
your
mother
spare
you
again
so
soon
you
have
scarcely
been
home
three
she
must
spare
me
cried
lucy
in
growing
excitement
i
simply
must
go
away
i
have
she
ran
her
fingers
hysterically
through
her
hair
don
t
you
see
that
i
have
to
go
away
i
didn
t
realize
at
the
time
and
of
course
i
want
to
see
constantinople
so
you
mean
that
since
you
have
broken
off
your
engagement
you
feel
yes
yes
i
knew
you
d
beebe
did
not
quite
understand
why
could
not
miss
honeychurch
repose
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
cecil
had
evidently
taken
up
the
dignified
line
and
was
not
going
to
annoy
her
then
it
struck
him
that
her
family
itself
might
be
annoying
he
hinted
this
to
her
and
she
accepted
the
hint
eagerly
yes
of
course
to
go
to
constantinople
until
they
are
used
to
the
idea
and
everything
has
calmed
i
am
afraid
it
has
been
a
bothersome
business
he
said
gently
no
not
at
all
cecil
was
very
kind
indeed
only
i
had
better
tell
you
the
whole
truth
since
you
have
heard
a
little
it
was
that
he
is
so
masterful
i
found
that
he
wouldn
t
let
me
go
my
own
way
he
would
improve
me
in
places
where
i
can
t
be
improved
cecil
won
t
let
a
woman
decide
for
herself
in
fact
he
daren
t
what
nonsense
i
do
talk
but
that
is
the
kind
of
it
is
what
i
gathered
from
my
own
observation
of
vyse
it
is
what
i
gather
from
all
that
i
have
known
of
you
i
do
sympathize
and
agree
most
profoundly
i
agree
so
much
that
you
must
let
me
make
one
little
criticism
is
it
worth
while
rushing
off
to
greece
but
i
must
go
somewhere
she
cried
i
have
been
worrying
all
the
morning
and
here
comes
the
very
she
struck
her
knees
with
clenched
fists
and
repeated
i
must
and
the
time
i
shall
have
with
mother
and
all
the
money
she
spent
on
me
last
spring
you
all
think
much
too
highly
of
me
i
wish
you
weren
t
so
at
this
moment
miss
bartlett
entered
and
her
nervousness
increased
i
must
get
away
ever
so
far
i
must
know
my
own
mind
and
where
i
want
to
come
along
tea
tea
tea
said
beebe
and
bustled
his
guests
out
of
the
he
hustled
them
so
quickly
that
he
forgot
his
hat
when
he
returned
for
it
he
heard
to
his
relief
and
surprise
the
tinkling
of
a
mozart
sonata
she
is
playing
again
he
said
to
miss
bartlett
lucy
can
always
play
was
the
acid
reply
one
is
very
thankful
that
she
has
such
a
resource
she
is
evidently
much
worried
as
of
course
she
ought
to
be
i
know
all
about
it
the
marriage
was
so
near
that
it
must
have
been
a
hard
struggle
before
she
could
wind
herself
up
to
miss
bartlett
gave
a
kind
of
wriggle
and
he
prepared
for
a
discussion
he
had
never
fathomed
miss
bartlett
as
he
had
put
it
to
himself
at
florence
she
might
yet
reveal
depths
of
strangeness
if
not
of
but
she
was
so
unsympathetic
that
she
must
be
reliable
he
assumed
that
much
and
he
had
no
hesitation
in
discussing
lucy
with
her
minnie
was
fortunately
collecting
ferns
she
opened
the
discussion
with
we
had
much
better
let
the
matter
i
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
there
should
be
no
gossip
in
summer
street
it
would
be
death
to
gossip
about
vyse
s
dismissal
at
the
present
beebe
raised
his
eyebrows
death
is
a
strong
word
surely
too
strong
there
was
no
question
of
tragedy
he
said
of
course
miss
honeychurch
will
make
the
fact
public
in
her
own
way
and
when
she
chooses
freddy
only
told
me
because
he
knew
she
would
not
i
know
said
miss
bartlett
civilly
yet
freddy
ought
not
to
have
told
even
you
one
can
not
be
too
quite
i
do
implore
absolute
secrecy
a
chance
word
to
a
chattering
friend
and
he
was
used
to
these
nervous
old
maids
and
to
the
exaggerated
importance
that
they
attach
to
words
a
rector
lives
in
a
web
of
petty
secrets
and
confidences
and
warnings
and
the
wiser
he
is
the
less
he
will
regard
them
he
will
change
the
subject
as
did
beebe
saying
cheerfully
have
you
heard
from
any
bertolini
people
lately
i
believe
you
keep
up
with
miss
lavish
it
is
odd
how
we
of
that
pension
who
seemed
such
a
fortuitous
collection
have
been
working
into
one
another
s
lives
two
three
four
six
of
us
no
eight
i
had
forgotten
the
emersons
have
kept
more
or
less
in
touch
we
must
really
give
the
signora
a
and
miss
bartlett
not
favouring
the
scheme
they
walked
up
the
hill
in
a
silence
which
was
only
broken
by
the
rector
naming
some
fern
on
the
summit
they
paused
the
sky
had
grown
wilder
since
he
stood
there
last
hour
giving
to
the
land
a
tragic
greatness
that
is
rare
in
surrey
grey
clouds
were
charging
across
tissues
of
white
which
stretched
and
shredded
and
tore
slowly
until
through
their
final
layers
there
gleamed
a
hint
of
the
disappearing
blue
summer
was
retreating
the
wind
roared
the
trees
groaned
yet
the
noise
seemed
insufficient
for
those
vast
operations
in
heaven
the
weather
was
breaking
up
breaking
broken
and
it
is
a
sense
of
the
fit
rather
than
of
the
supernatural
that
equips
such
crises
with
the
salvos
of
angelic
artillery
beebe
s
eyes
rested
on
windy
corner
where
lucy
sat
practising
mozart
no
smile
came
to
his
lips
and
changing
the
subject
again
he
said
we
shan
t
have
rain
but
we
shall
have
darkness
so
let
us
hurry
on
the
darkness
last
night
was
they
reached
the
beehive
tavern
at
about
five
o
clock
that
amiable
hostelry
possesses
a
verandah
in
which
the
young
and
the
unwise
do
dearly
love
to
sit
while
guests
of
more
mature
years
seek
a
pleasant
sanded
room
and
have
tea
at
a
table
comfortably
beebe
saw
that
miss
bartlett
would
be
cold
if
she
sat
out
and
that
minnie
would
be
dull
if
she
sat
in
so
he
proposed
a
division
of
forces
they
would
hand
the
child
her
food
through
the
window
thus
he
was
incidentally
enabled
to
discuss
the
fortunes
of
lucy
i
have
been
thinking
miss
bartlett
he
said
and
unless
you
very
much
object
i
would
like
to
reopen
that
she
bowed
nothing
about
the
past
i
know
little
and
care
less
about
that
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
it
is
to
your
cousin
s
credit
she
has
acted
loftily
and
rightly
and
it
is
like
her
gentle
modesty
to
say
that
we
think
too
highly
of
her
but
the
future
seriously
what
do
you
think
of
this
greek
plan
he
pulled
out
the
letter
again
i
don
t
know
whether
you
overheard
but
she
wants
to
join
the
miss
alans
in
their
mad
career
it
s
all
i
can
t
explain
it
s
miss
bartlett
read
the
letter
in
silence
laid
it
down
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
read
it
again
i
can
t
see
the
point
of
it
to
his
astonishment
she
replied
there
i
can
not
agree
with
you
in
it
i
spy
lucy
s
really
now
why
she
wanted
to
leave
windy
i
know
but
it
seems
so
odd
so
unlike
her
so
i
was
going
to
say
it
is
natural
surely
after
such
painful
scenes
that
she
should
desire
a
here
apparently
was
one
of
those
points
that
the
male
intellect
misses
beebe
exclaimed
so
she
says
herself
and
since
another
lady
agrees
with
her
i
must
own
that
i
am
partially
convinced
perhaps
she
must
have
a
change
i
have
no
sisters
or
and
i
don
t
understand
these
things
but
why
need
she
go
as
far
as
greece
you
may
well
ask
that
replied
miss
bartlett
who
was
evidently
interested
and
had
almost
dropped
her
evasive
manner
why
greece
what
is
it
minnie
dear
jam
why
not
tunbridge
wells
oh
beebe
i
had
a
long
and
most
unsatisfactory
interview
with
dear
lucy
this
morning
i
can
not
help
her
i
will
say
no
more
perhaps
i
have
already
said
too
much
i
am
not
to
talk
i
wanted
her
to
spend
six
months
with
me
at
tunbridge
wells
and
she
beebe
poked
at
a
crumb
with
his
knife
but
my
feelings
are
of
no
importance
i
know
too
well
that
i
get
on
lucy
s
nerves
our
tour
was
a
failure
she
wanted
to
leave
florence
and
when
we
got
to
rome
she
did
not
want
to
be
in
rome
and
all
the
time
i
felt
that
i
was
spending
her
mother
s
money
let
us
keep
to
the
future
though
interrupted
beebe
i
want
your
very
well
said
charlotte
with
a
choky
abruptness
that
was
new
to
him
though
familiar
to
lucy
i
for
one
will
help
her
to
go
to
greece
will
you
beebe
considered
it
is
absolutely
necessary
she
continued
lowering
her
veil
and
whispering
through
it
with
a
passion
an
intensity
that
surprised
him
i
know
i
the
darkness
was
coming
on
and
he
felt
that
this
odd
woman
really
did
know
she
must
not
stop
here
a
moment
and
we
must
keep
quiet
till
she
goes
i
trust
that
the
servants
know
nothing
afterwards
but
i
may
have
said
too
much
already
only
lucy
and
i
are
helpless
against
honeychurch
alone
if
you
help
we
may
succeed
otherwise
otherwise
otherwise
she
repeated
as
if
the
word
held
finality
yes
i
will
help
her
said
the
clergyman
setting
his
jaw
firm
come
let
us
go
back
now
and
settle
the
whole
thing
miss
bartlett
burst
into
florid
gratitude
the
tavern
sign
a
beehive
trimmed
evenly
with
bees
creaked
in
the
wind
outside
as
she
thanked
him
beebe
did
not
quite
understand
the
situation
but
then
he
did
not
desire
to
understand
it
nor
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
of
another
man
that
would
have
attracted
a
grosser
mind
he
only
felt
that
miss
bartlett
knew
of
some
vague
influence
from
which
the
girl
desired
to
be
delivered
and
which
might
well
be
clothed
in
the
fleshly
form
its
very
vagueness
spurred
him
into
his
belief
in
celibacy
so
reticent
so
carefully
concealed
beneath
his
tolerance
and
culture
now
came
to
the
surface
and
expanded
like
some
delicate
flower
they
that
marry
do
well
but
they
that
refrain
do
so
ran
his
belief
and
he
never
heard
that
an
engagement
was
broken
off
but
with
a
slight
feeling
of
pleasure
in
the
case
of
lucy
the
feeling
was
intensified
through
dislike
of
cecil
and
he
was
willing
to
go
further
to
place
her
out
of
danger
until
she
could
confirm
her
resolution
of
virginity
the
feeling
was
very
subtle
and
quite
undogmatic
and
he
never
imparted
it
to
any
other
of
the
characters
in
this
entanglement
yet
it
existed
and
it
alone
explains
his
action
subsequently
and
his
influence
on
the
action
of
others
the
compact
that
he
made
with
miss
bartlett
in
the
tavern
was
to
help
not
only
lucy
but
religion
also
they
hurried
home
through
a
world
of
black
and
grey
he
conversed
on
indifferent
topics
the
emersons
need
of
a
housekeeper
servants
italian
servants
novels
about
italy
novels
with
a
purpose
could
literature
influence
life
windy
corner
glimmered
in
the
garden
honeychurch
now
helped
by
freddy
still
wrestled
with
the
lives
of
her
flowers
it
gets
too
dark
she
said
hopelessly
this
comes
of
putting
off
we
might
have
known
the
weather
would
break
up
soon
and
now
lucy
wants
to
go
to
greece
i
don
t
know
what
the
world
s
coming
mrs
honeychurch
he
said
go
to
greece
she
must
come
up
to
the
house
and
let
s
talk
it
over
do
you
in
the
first
place
mind
her
breaking
with
vyse
mr
beebe
i
m
thankful
simply
so
am
i
said
freddy
good
now
come
up
to
the
they
conferred
in
the
for
half
an
hour
lucy
would
never
have
carried
the
greek
scheme
alone
it
was
expensive
and
dramatic
both
qualities
that
her
mother
loathed
nor
would
charlotte
have
succeeded
the
honours
of
the
day
rested
with
beebe
by
his
tact
and
common
sense
and
by
his
influence
as
a
clergyman
for
a
clergyman
who
was
not
a
fool
influenced
honeychurch
greatly
he
bent
her
to
their
purpose
i
don
t
see
why
greece
is
necessary
she
said
but
as
you
do
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
it
must
be
something
i
can
t
understand
lucy
let
s
tell
her
lucy
she
is
playing
the
piano
beebe
said
he
opened
the
door
and
heard
the
words
of
a
song
look
not
thou
on
beauty
s
i
didn
t
know
that
miss
honeychurch
sang
sit
thou
still
when
kings
are
arming
taste
not
when
the
glistens
it
s
a
song
that
cecil
gave
her
how
odd
girls
are
what
s
that
called
lucy
stopping
short
all
right
dear
said
honeychurch
kindly
she
went
into
the
and
beebe
heard
her
kiss
lucy
and
say
i
am
sorry
i
was
so
cross
about
greece
but
it
came
on
the
top
of
the
rather
a
hard
voice
said
thank
you
mother
that
doesn
t
matter
a
and
you
are
right
too
greece
will
be
all
right
you
can
go
if
the
miss
alans
will
have
oh
splendid
oh
thank
you
beebe
followed
lucy
still
sat
at
the
piano
with
her
hands
over
the
keys
she
was
glad
but
he
had
expected
greater
gladness
her
mother
bent
over
her
freddy
to
whom
she
had
been
singing
reclined
on
the
floor
with
his
head
against
her
and
an
unlit
pipe
between
his
lips
oddly
enough
the
group
was
beautiful
beebe
who
loved
the
art
of
the
past
was
reminded
of
a
favourite
theme
the
santa
conversazione
in
which
people
who
care
for
one
another
are
painted
chatting
together
about
noble
things
a
theme
neither
sensual
nor
sensational
and
therefore
ignored
by
the
art
of
why
should
lucy
want
either
to
marry
or
to
travel
when
she
had
such
friends
at
home
taste
not
when
the
glistens
speak
not
when
the
people
listens
she
continued
here
s
mr
beebe
knows
my
rude
it
s
a
beautiful
song
and
a
wise
one
said
he
go
it
isn
t
very
good
she
said
listlessly
i
forget
why
harmony
or
i
suspected
it
was
unscholarly
it
s
so
the
tune
s
right
enough
said
freddy
but
the
words
are
rotten
why
throw
up
the
sponge
how
stupidly
you
talk
said
his
sister
the
santa
conversazione
was
broken
up
after
all
there
was
no
reason
that
lucy
should
talk
about
greece
or
thank
him
for
persuading
her
mother
so
he
said
freddy
lit
his
bicycle
lamp
for
him
in
the
porch
and
with
his
usual
felicity
of
phrase
said
this
has
been
a
day
and
a
stop
thine
ear
against
the
singer
wait
a
minute
she
is
from
the
red
gold
keep
thy
finger
vacant
heart
and
hand
and
eye
easy
live
and
quiet
i
love
weather
like
this
said
freddy
beebe
passed
into
it
the
two
main
facts
were
clear
she
had
behaved
splendidly
and
he
had
helped
her
he
could
not
expect
to
master
the
details
of
so
big
a
change
in
a
girl
s
life
if
here
and
there
he
was
dissatisfied
or
puzzled
he
must
acquiesce
she
was
choosing
the
better
part
vacant
heart
and
hand
and
eye
perhaps
the
song
stated
the
better
part
rather
too
strongly
he
half
fancied
that
the
soaring
accompaniment
which
he
did
not
lose
in
the
shout
of
the
gale
really
agreed
with
freddy
and
was
gently
criticizing
the
words
that
it
adorned
vacant
heart
and
hand
and
eye
easy
live
and
quiet
however
for
the
fourth
time
windy
corner
lay
poised
below
him
now
as
a
beacon
in
the
roaring
tides
of
darkness
chapter
xix
lying
to
emerson
the
miss
alans
were
found
in
their
beloved
temperance
hotel
near
bloomsbury
a
clean
airless
establishment
much
patronized
by
provincial
england
they
always
perched
there
before
crossing
the
great
seas
and
for
a
week
or
two
would
fidget
gently
over
clothes
mackintosh
squares
digestive
bread
and
other
continental
necessaries
that
there
are
shops
abroad
even
in
athens
never
occurred
to
them
for
they
regarded
travel
as
a
species
of
warfare
only
to
be
undertaken
by
those
who
have
been
fully
armed
at
the
haymarket
stores
miss
honeychurch
they
trusted
would
take
care
to
equip
herself
duly
quinine
could
now
be
obtained
in
tabloids
paper
soap
was
a
great
help
towards
freshening
up
one
s
face
in
the
train
lucy
promised
a
little
depressed
but
of
course
you
know
all
about
these
things
and
you
have
vyse
to
help
you
a
gentleman
is
such
a
honeychurch
who
had
come
up
to
town
with
her
daughter
began
to
drum
nervously
upon
her
we
think
it
so
good
of
vyse
to
spare
you
miss
catharine
continued
it
is
not
every
young
man
who
would
be
so
unselfish
but
perhaps
he
will
come
out
and
join
you
later
or
does
his
work
keep
him
in
london
said
miss
teresa
the
more
acute
and
less
kindly
of
the
two
sisters
however
we
shall
see
him
when
he
sees
you
off
i
do
so
long
to
see
no
one
will
see
lucy
off
interposed
honeychurch
she
doesn
t
like
no
i
hate
said
lucy
really
how
funny
i
should
have
thought
that
in
this
case
oh
honeychurch
you
aren
t
going
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
have
met
you
they
escaped
and
lucy
said
with
relief
that
s
all
right
we
just
got
through
that
but
her
mother
was
annoyed
i
should
be
told
dear
that
i
am
unsympathetic
but
i
can
not
see
why
you
didn
t
tell
your
friends
about
cecil
and
be
done
with
it
there
all
the
time
we
had
to
sit
fencing
and
almost
telling
lies
and
be
seen
through
too
i
dare
say
which
is
most
lucy
had
plenty
to
say
in
reply
she
described
the
miss
alans
character
they
were
such
gossips
and
if
one
told
them
the
news
would
be
everywhere
in
no
time
but
why
shouldn
t
it
be
everywhere
in
no
time
because
i
settled
with
cecil
not
to
announce
it
until
i
left
england
i
shall
tell
them
then
it
s
much
pleasanter
how
wet
it
is
let
s
turn
in
here
was
the
british
museum
honeychurch
refused
if
they
must
take
shelter
let
it
be
in
a
shop
lucy
felt
contemptuous
for
she
was
on
the
tack
of
caring
for
greek
sculpture
and
had
already
borrowed
a
mythical
dictionary
from
beebe
to
get
up
the
names
of
the
goddesses
and
gods
oh
well
let
it
be
shop
then
let
s
go
to
mudie
s
i
ll
buy
a
you
know
lucy
you
and
charlotte
and
beebe
all
tell
me
i
m
so
stupid
so
i
suppose
i
am
but
i
shall
never
understand
this
work
you
ve
got
rid
of
cecil
well
and
good
and
i
m
thankful
he
s
gone
though
i
did
feel
angry
for
the
minute
but
why
not
announce
it
why
this
hushing
up
and
it
s
only
for
a
few
but
why
at
all
lucy
was
silent
she
was
drifting
away
from
her
mother
it
was
quite
easy
to
say
because
george
emerson
has
been
bothering
me
and
if
he
hears
i
ve
given
up
cecil
may
begin
again
quite
easy
and
it
had
the
incidental
advantage
of
being
true
but
she
could
not
say
it
she
disliked
confidences
for
they
might
lead
to
and
to
that
king
of
terrors
light
ever
since
that
last
evening
at
florence
she
had
deemed
it
unwise
to
reveal
her
soul
honeychurch
too
was
silent
she
was
thinking
my
daughter
won
t
answer
me
she
would
rather
be
with
those
inquisitive
old
maids
than
with
freddy
and
me
any
rag
tag
and
bobtail
apparently
does
if
she
can
leave
her
and
as
in
her
case
thoughts
never
remained
unspoken
long
she
burst
out
with
you
re
tired
of
windy
this
was
perfectly
true
lucy
had
hoped
to
return
to
windy
corner
when
she
escaped
from
cecil
but
she
discovered
that
her
home
existed
no
longer
it
might
exist
for
freddy
who
still
lived
and
thought
straight
but
not
for
one
who
had
deliberately
warped
the
brain
she
did
not
acknowledge
that
her
brain
was
warped
for
the
brain
itself
must
assist
in
that
acknowledgment
and
she
was
disordering
the
very
instruments
of
life
she
only
felt
i
do
not
love
george
i
broke
off
my
engagement
because
i
did
not
love
george
i
must
go
to
greece
because
i
do
not
love
george
it
is
more
important
that
i
should
look
up
gods
in
the
dictionary
than
that
i
should
help
my
mother
everyone
else
is
behaving
very
she
only
felt
irritable
and
petulant
and
anxious
to
do
what
she
was
not
expected
to
do
and
in
this
spirit
she
proceeded
with
the
conversation
oh
mother
what
rubbish
you
talk
of
course
i
m
not
tired
of
windy
then
why
not
say
so
at
once
instead
of
considering
half
an
hour
she
laughed
faintly
half
a
minute
would
be
perhaps
you
would
like
to
stay
away
from
your
home
altogether
hush
mother
people
will
hear
you
for
they
had
entered
mudie
s
she
bought
baedeker
and
then
continued
of
course
i
want
to
live
at
home
but
as
we
are
talking
about
it
i
may
as
well
say
that
i
shall
want
to
be
away
in
the
future
more
than
i
have
been
you
see
i
come
into
my
money
next
tears
came
into
her
mother
s
eyes
driven
by
nameless
bewilderment
by
what
is
in
older
people
termed
eccentricity
lucy
determined
to
make
this
point
clear
i
ve
seen
the
world
so
little
i
felt
so
out
of
things
in
italy
i
have
seen
so
little
of
life
one
ought
to
come
up
to
london
more
not
a
cheap
ticket
like
but
to
stop
i
might
even
share
a
flat
for
a
little
with
some
other
and
mess
with
typewriters
and
exploded
honeychurch
and
agitate
and
scream
and
be
carried
off
kicking
by
the
police
and
call
it
a
mission
when
no
one
wants
you
and
call
it
duty
when
it
means
that
you
can
t
stand
your
own
home
and
call
it
work
when
thousands
of
men
are
starving
with
the
competition
as
it
is
and
then
to
prepare
yourself
find
two
doddering
old
ladies
and
go
abroad
with
i
want
more
independence
said
lucy
lamely
she
knew
that
she
wanted
something
and
independence
is
a
useful
cry
we
can
always
say
that
we
have
not
got
it
she
tried
to
remember
her
emotions
in
florence
those
had
been
sincere
and
passionate
and
had
suggested
beauty
rather
than
short
skirts
and
but
independence
was
certainly
her
cue
very
well
take
your
independence
and
be
gone
rush
up
and
down
and
round
the
world
and
come
back
as
thin
as
a
lath
with
the
bad
food
despise
the
house
that
your
father
built
and
the
garden
that
he
planted
and
our
dear
view
and
then
share
a
flat
with
another
lucy
screwed
up
her
mouth
and
said
perhaps
i
spoke
oh
goodness
her
mother
flashed
how
you
do
remind
me
of
charlotte
bartlett
charlotte
flashed
lucy
in
her
turn
pierced
at
last
by
a
vivid
pain
more
every
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
mother
charlotte
and
i
are
not
the
very
least
well
i
see
the
likeness
the
same
eternal
worrying
the
same
taking
back
of
words
you
and
charlotte
trying
to
divide
two
apples
among
three
people
last
night
might
be
what
rubbish
and
if
you
dislike
charlotte
so
it
s
rather
a
pity
you
asked
her
to
stop
i
warned
you
about
her
i
begged
you
implored
you
not
to
but
of
course
it
was
not
listened
there
you
i
beg
your
pardon
charlotte
again
my
dear
that
s
all
her
very
lucy
clenched
her
teeth
my
point
is
that
you
oughtn
t
to
have
asked
charlotte
to
stop
i
wish
you
would
keep
to
the
and
the
conversation
died
off
into
a
wrangle
she
and
her
mother
shopped
in
silence
spoke
little
in
the
train
little
again
in
the
carriage
which
met
them
at
dorking
station
it
had
poured
all
day
and
as
they
ascended
through
the
deep
surrey
lanes
showers
of
water
fell
from
the
and
rattled
on
the
hood
lucy
complained
that
the
hood
was
stuffy
leaning
forward
she
looked
out
into
the
steaming
dusk
and
watched
the
pass
like
a
over
mud
and
leaves
and
reveal
nothing
beautiful
the
crush
when
charlotte
gets
in
will
be
abominable
she
remarked
for
they
were
to
pick
up
miss
bartlett
at
summer
street
where
she
had
been
dropped
as
the
carriage
went
down
to
pay
a
call
on
beebe
s
old
mother
we
shall
have
to
sit
three
a
side
because
the
trees
drop
and
yet
it
isn
t
raining
oh
for
a
little
air
then
she
listened
to
the
horse
s
hoofs
he
has
not
told
he
has
not
that
melody
was
blurred
by
the
soft
road
can
t
we
have
the
hood
down
she
demanded
and
her
mother
with
sudden
tenderness
said
very
well
old
lady
stop
the
and
the
horse
was
stopped
and
lucy
and
powell
wrestled
with
the
hood
and
squirted
water
down
honeychurch
s
neck
but
now
that
the
hood
was
down
she
did
see
something
that
she
would
have
missed
there
were
no
lights
in
the
windows
of
cissie
villa
and
round
the
garden
gate
she
fancied
she
saw
a
padlock
is
that
house
to
let
again
powell
she
called
yes
miss
he
replied
have
they
gone
it
is
too
far
out
of
town
for
the
young
gentleman
and
his
father
s
rheumatism
has
come
on
so
he
can
t
stop
on
alone
so
they
are
trying
to
let
furnished
was
the
answer
they
have
gone
then
yes
miss
they
have
lucy
sank
back
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
rectory
she
got
out
to
call
for
miss
bartlett
so
the
emersons
had
gone
and
all
this
bother
about
greece
had
been
unnecessary
waste
that
word
seemed
to
sum
up
the
whole
of
life
wasted
plans
wasted
money
wasted
love
and
she
had
wounded
her
mother
was
it
possible
that
she
had
muddled
things
away
quite
possible
other
people
had
when
the
maid
opened
the
door
she
was
unable
to
speak
and
stared
stupidly
into
the
hall
miss
bartlett
at
once
came
forward
and
after
a
long
preamble
asked
a
great
favour
might
she
go
to
church
beebe
and
his
mother
had
already
gone
but
she
had
refused
to
start
until
she
obtained
her
hostess
s
full
sanction
for
it
would
mean
keeping
the
horse
waiting
a
good
ten
minutes
more
certainly
said
the
hostess
wearily
i
forgot
it
was
friday
let
s
all
go
powell
can
go
round
to
the
lucy
dearest
no
church
for
me
thank
a
sigh
and
they
departed
the
church
was
invisible
but
up
in
the
darkness
to
the
left
there
was
a
hint
of
colour
this
was
a
stained
window
through
which
some
feeble
light
was
shining
and
when
the
door
opened
lucy
heard
beebe
s
voice
running
through
the
litany
to
a
minute
congregation
even
their
church
built
upon
the
slope
of
the
hill
so
artfully
with
its
beautiful
raised
transept
and
its
spire
of
silvery
shingle
even
their
church
had
lost
its
charm
and
the
thing
one
never
talked
about
religion
was
fading
like
all
the
other
things
she
followed
the
maid
into
the
rectory
would
she
object
to
sitting
in
beebe
s
study
there
was
only
that
one
fire
she
would
not
object
some
one
was
there
already
for
lucy
heard
the
words
a
lady
to
wait
old
emerson
was
sitting
by
the
fire
with
his
foot
upon
a
oh
miss
honeychurch
that
you
should
come
he
quavered
and
lucy
saw
an
alteration
in
him
since
last
sunday
not
a
word
would
come
to
her
lips
george
she
had
faced
and
could
have
faced
again
but
she
had
forgotten
how
to
treat
his
father
miss
honeychurch
dear
we
are
so
sorry
george
is
so
sorry
he
thought
he
had
a
right
to
try
i
can
not
blame
my
boy
and
yet
i
wish
he
had
told
me
first
he
ought
not
to
have
tried
i
knew
nothing
about
it
at
if
only
she
could
remember
how
to
behave
he
held
up
his
hand
but
you
must
not
scold
lucy
turned
her
back
and
began
to
look
at
beebe
s
books
i
taught
him
he
quavered
to
trust
in
love
i
said
when
love
comes
that
is
i
said
passion
does
not
blind
no
passion
is
sanity
and
the
woman
you
love
she
is
the
only
person
you
will
ever
really
he
sighed
true
everlastingly
true
though
my
day
is
over
and
though
there
is
the
result
poor
boy
he
is
so
sorry
he
said
he
knew
it
was
madness
when
you
brought
your
cousin
in
that
whatever
you
felt
you
did
not
mean
yet
his
voice
gathered
strength
he
spoke
out
to
make
certain
miss
honeychurch
do
you
remember
italy
lucy
selected
a
book
a
volume
of
old
testament
commentaries
holding
it
up
to
her
eyes
she
said
i
have
no
wish
to
discuss
italy
or
any
subject
connected
with
your
but
you
do
remember
it
he
has
misbehaved
himself
from
the
i
only
was
told
that
he
loved
you
last
sunday
i
never
could
judge
behaviour
i
i
suppose
he
feeling
a
little
steadier
she
put
the
book
back
and
turned
round
to
him
his
face
was
drooping
and
swollen
but
his
eyes
though
they
were
sunken
deep
gleamed
with
a
child
s
courage
why
he
has
behaved
abominably
she
said
i
am
glad
he
is
sorry
do
you
know
what
he
did
not
abominably
was
the
gentle
correction
he
only
tried
when
he
should
not
have
tried
you
have
all
you
want
miss
honeychurch
you
are
going
to
marry
the
man
you
love
do
not
go
out
of
george
s
life
saying
he
is
no
of
course
said
lucy
ashamed
at
the
reference
to
cecil
abominable
is
much
too
strong
i
am
sorry
i
used
it
about
your
son
i
think
i
will
go
to
church
after
all
my
mother
and
my
cousin
have
gone
i
shall
not
be
so
very
late
especially
as
he
has
gone
under
he
said
quietly
what
was
that
gone
under
he
beat
his
palms
together
in
silence
his
head
fell
on
his
chest
i
don
t
as
his
mother
but
emerson
emerson
what
are
you
talking
about
when
i
wouldn
t
have
george
baptized
said
he
lucy
was
frightened
and
she
agreed
that
baptism
was
nothing
but
he
caught
that
fever
when
he
was
twelve
and
she
turned
round
she
thought
it
a
he
shuddered
oh
horrible
when
we
had
given
up
that
sort
of
thing
and
broken
away
from
her
parents
oh
horrible
worst
of
all
worse
than
death
when
you
have
made
a
little
clearing
in
the
wilderness
planted
your
little
garden
let
in
your
sunlight
and
then
the
weeds
creep
in
again
a
judgement
and
our
boy
had
typhoid
because
no
clergyman
had
dropped
water
on
him
in
church
is
it
possible
miss
honeychurch
shall
we
slip
back
into
the
darkness
for
ever
i
don
t
know
gasped
lucy
i
don
t
understand
this
sort
of
thing
i
was
not
meant
to
understand
but
mr
eager
he
came
when
i
was
out
and
acted
according
to
his
principles
i
don
t
blame
him
or
any
one
but
by
the
time
george
was
well
she
was
ill
he
made
her
think
about
sin
and
she
went
under
thinking
about
it
was
thus
that
emerson
had
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
oh
how
terrible
said
lucy
forgetting
her
own
affairs
at
last
he
was
not
baptized
said
the
old
man
i
did
hold
and
he
looked
with
unwavering
eyes
at
the
rows
of
books
as
if
at
what
cost
he
had
won
a
victory
over
them
my
boy
shall
go
back
to
the
earth
she
asked
whether
young
emerson
was
oh
last
he
started
into
the
present
george
last
sunday
no
not
ill
just
gone
under
he
is
never
ill
but
he
is
his
mother
s
son
her
eyes
were
his
and
she
had
that
forehead
that
i
think
so
beautiful
and
he
will
not
think
it
worth
while
to
live
it
was
always
touch
and
go
he
will
live
but
he
will
not
think
it
worth
while
to
live
he
will
never
think
anything
worth
while
you
remember
that
church
at
florence
lucy
did
remember
and
how
she
had
suggested
that
george
should
collect
postage
stamps
after
you
left
florence
horrible
then
we
took
the
house
here
and
he
goes
bathing
with
your
brother
and
became
better
you
saw
him
bathing
i
am
so
sorry
but
it
is
no
good
discussing
this
affair
i
am
deeply
sorry
about
then
there
came
something
about
a
novel
i
didn
t
follow
it
at
all
i
had
to
hear
so
much
and
he
minded
telling
me
he
finds
me
too
old
ah
well
one
must
have
failures
george
comes
down
and
takes
me
up
to
his
london
rooms
he
can
t
bear
to
be
about
here
and
i
must
be
where
he
mr
emerson
cried
the
girl
don
t
leave
at
least
not
on
my
account
i
am
going
to
greece
don
t
leave
your
comfortable
it
was
the
first
time
her
voice
had
been
kind
and
he
smiled
how
good
everyone
is
and
look
at
beebe
housing
me
came
over
this
morning
and
heard
i
was
going
here
i
am
so
comfortable
with
a
yes
but
you
won
t
go
back
to
london
it
s
i
must
be
with
george
i
must
make
him
care
to
live
and
down
here
he
can
t
he
says
the
thought
of
seeing
you
and
of
hearing
about
you
i
am
not
justifying
him
i
am
only
saying
what
has
oh
emerson
she
took
hold
of
his
hand
you
mustn
t
i
ve
been
bother
enough
to
the
world
by
now
i
can
t
have
you
moving
out
of
your
house
when
you
like
it
and
perhaps
losing
money
through
it
all
on
my
account
you
must
stop
i
am
just
going
to
all
the
way
to
greece
her
manner
altered
to
greece
so
you
must
stop
you
won
t
talk
about
this
business
i
know
i
can
trust
you
certainly
you
can
we
either
have
you
in
our
lives
or
leave
you
to
the
life
that
you
have
i
shouldn
t
want
i
suppose
vyse
is
very
angry
with
george
no
it
was
wrong
of
george
to
try
we
have
pushed
our
beliefs
too
far
i
fancy
that
we
deserve
she
looked
at
the
books
again
black
brown
and
that
acrid
theological
blue
they
surrounded
the
visitors
on
every
side
they
were
piled
on
the
tables
they
pressed
against
the
very
ceiling
to
lucy
who
could
not
see
that
emerson
was
profoundly
religious
and
differed
from
beebe
chiefly
by
his
acknowledgment
of
passion
it
seemed
dreadful
that
the
old
man
should
crawl
into
such
a
sanctum
when
he
was
unhappy
and
be
dependent
on
the
bounty
of
a
clergyman
more
certain
than
ever
that
she
was
tired
he
offered
her
his
chair
no
please
sit
still
i
think
i
will
sit
in
the
miss
honeychurch
you
do
sound
not
a
bit
said
lucy
with
trembling
lips
but
you
are
and
there
s
a
look
of
george
about
you
and
what
were
you
saying
about
going
abroad
she
was
silent
greece
and
she
saw
that
he
was
thinking
the
word
over
greece
but
you
were
to
be
married
this
year
i
not
till
january
it
wasn
t
said
lucy
clasping
her
hands
would
she
tell
an
actual
lie
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
suppose
that
vyse
is
going
with
you
i
hope
it
isn
t
because
george
spoke
that
you
are
both
going
i
hope
that
you
will
enjoy
greece
with
thank
at
that
moment
beebe
came
back
from
church
his
cassock
was
covered
with
rain
that
s
all
right
he
said
kindly
i
counted
on
you
two
keeping
each
other
company
it
s
pouring
again
the
entire
congregation
which
consists
of
your
cousin
your
mother
and
my
mother
stands
waiting
in
the
church
till
the
carriage
fetches
it
did
powell
go
round
i
think
so
i
ll
no
of
course
i
ll
see
how
are
the
miss
alans
very
well
thank
did
you
tell
emerson
about
greece
i
i
don
t
you
think
it
very
plucky
of
her
emerson
to
undertake
the
two
miss
alans
now
miss
honeychurch
go
back
keep
warm
i
think
three
is
such
a
courageous
number
to
go
and
he
hurried
off
to
the
stables
he
is
not
going
she
said
hoarsely
i
made
a
slip
vyse
does
stop
behind
in
somehow
it
was
impossible
to
cheat
this
old
man
to
george
to
cecil
she
would
have
lied
again
but
he
seemed
so
near
the
end
of
things
so
dignified
in
his
approach
to
the
gulf
of
which
he
gave
one
account
and
the
books
that
surrounded
him
another
so
mild
to
the
rough
paths
that
he
had
traversed
that
the
true
chivalry
not
the
chivalry
of
sex
but
the
true
chivalry
that
all
the
young
may
show
to
all
the
old
awoke
in
her
and
at
whatever
risk
she
told
him
that
cecil
was
not
her
companion
to
greece
and
she
spoke
so
seriously
that
the
risk
became
a
certainty
and
he
lifting
his
eyes
said
you
are
leaving
him
you
are
leaving
the
man
you
love
i
i
had
why
miss
honeychurch
why
terror
came
over
her
and
she
lied
again
she
made
the
long
convincing
speech
that
she
had
made
to
beebe
and
intended
to
make
to
the
world
when
she
announced
that
her
engagement
was
no
more
he
heard
her
in
silence
and
then
said
my
dear
i
am
worried
about
you
it
seems
to
me
dreamily
she
was
not
alarmed
that
you
are
in
a
she
shook
her
head
take
an
old
man
s
word
there
s
nothing
worse
than
a
muddle
in
all
the
world
it
is
easy
to
face
death
and
fate
and
the
things
that
sound
so
dreadful
it
is
on
my
muddles
that
i
look
back
with
horror
on
the
things
that
i
might
have
avoided
we
can
help
one
another
but
little
i
used
to
think
i
could
teach
young
people
the
whole
of
life
but
i
know
better
now
and
all
my
teaching
of
george
has
come
down
to
this
beware
of
muddle
do
you
remember
in
that
church
when
you
pretended
to
be
annoyed
with
me
and
weren
t
do
you
remember
before
when
you
refused
the
room
with
the
view
those
were
muddles
little
but
ominous
and
i
am
fearing
that
you
are
in
one
she
was
silent
don
t
trust
me
miss
honeychurch
though
life
is
very
glorious
it
is
she
was
still
silent
life
wrote
a
friend
of
mine
is
a
public
performance
on
the
violin
in
which
you
must
learn
the
instrument
as
you
go
i
think
he
puts
it
well
man
has
to
pick
up
the
use
of
his
functions
as
he
goes
along
especially
the
function
of
then
he
burst
out
excitedly
that
s
it
that
s
what
i
mean
you
love
george
and
after
his
long
preamble
the
three
words
burst
against
lucy
like
waves
from
the
open
sea
but
you
do
he
went
on
not
waiting
for
contradiction
you
love
the
boy
body
and
soul
plainly
directly
as
he
loves
you
and
no
other
word
expresses
it
you
won
t
marry
the
other
man
for
his
how
dare
you
gasped
lucy
with
the
roaring
of
waters
in
her
ears
oh
how
like
a
man
i
mean
to
suppose
that
a
woman
is
always
thinking
about
a
but
you
she
summoned
physical
disgust
you
re
shocked
but
i
mean
to
shock
you
it
s
the
only
hope
at
times
i
can
reach
you
no
other
way
you
must
marry
or
your
life
will
be
wasted
you
have
gone
too
far
to
retreat
i
have
no
time
for
the
tenderness
and
the
comradeship
and
the
poetry
and
the
things
that
really
matter
and
for
which
you
marry
i
know
that
with
george
you
will
find
them
and
that
you
love
him
then
be
his
wife
he
is
already
part
of
you
though
you
fly
to
greece
and
never
see
him
again
or
forget
his
very
name
george
will
work
in
your
thoughts
till
you
die
it
isn
t
possible
to
love
and
to
part
you
will
wish
that
it
was
you
can
transmute
love
ignore
it
muddle
it
but
you
can
never
pull
it
out
of
you
i
know
by
experience
that
the
poets
are
right
love
is
lucy
began
to
cry
with
anger
and
though
her
anger
passed
away
soon
her
tears
remained
i
only
wish
poets
would
say
this
too
love
is
of
the
body
not
the
body
but
of
the
body
ah
the
misery
that
would
be
saved
if
we
confessed
that
ah
for
a
little
directness
to
liberate
the
soul
your
soul
dear
lucy
i
hate
the
word
now
because
of
all
the
cant
with
which
superstition
has
wrapped
it
round
but
we
have
souls
i
can
not
say
how
they
came
nor
whither
they
go
but
we
have
them
and
i
see
you
ruining
yours
i
can
not
bear
it
it
is
again
the
darkness
creeping
in
it
is
then
he
checked
himself
what
nonsense
i
have
talked
how
abstract
and
remote
and
i
have
made
you
cry
dear
girl
forgive
my
prosiness
marry
my
boy
when
i
think
what
life
is
and
how
seldom
love
is
answered
by
love
marry
him
it
is
one
of
the
moments
for
which
the
world
was
she
could
not
understand
him
the
words
were
indeed
remote
yet
as
he
spoke
the
darkness
was
withdrawn
veil
after
veil
and
she
saw
to
the
bottom
of
her
soul
then
lucy
you
ve
frightened
me
she
moaned
cecil
beebe
the
ticket
s
bought
she
fell
sobbing
into
the
chair
i
m
caught
in
the
tangle
i
must
suffer
and
grow
old
away
from
him
i
can
not
break
the
whole
of
life
for
his
sake
they
trusted
a
carriage
drew
up
at
the
give
george
my
love
once
only
tell
him
then
she
arranged
her
veil
while
the
tears
poured
over
her
cheeks
inside
lucy
no
they
are
in
the
hall
oh
please
not
emerson
they
trust

but
why
should
they
when
you
have
deceived
them
beebe
opened
the
door
saying

my
you
re
not
worthy
of
their
what

that
said
beebe
sharply
i
was
saying
why
should
you
trust
her
when
she
deceived
you
one
minute
he
came
in
and
shut
the
door
i
don
t
follow
you
emerson
to
whom
do
you
refer
trust
whom
i
mean
she
has
pretended
to
you
that
she
did
not
love
george
they
have
loved
one
another
all
beebe
looked
at
the
sobbing
girl
he
was
very
quiet
and
his
white
face
with
its
ruddy
whiskers
seemed
suddenly
inhuman
a
long
black
column
he
stood
and
awaited
her
reply
i
shall
never
marry
him
quavered
lucy
a
look
of
contempt
came
over
him
and
he
said
why
not
mr
beebe
i
have
misled
you
i
have
misled
myself
oh
rubbish
miss
honeychurch
it
is
not
rubbish
said
the
old
man
hotly
it
s
the
part
of
people
that
you
don
t
beebe
laid
his
hand
on
the
old
man
s
shoulder
pleasantly
lucy
lucy
called
voices
from
the
carriage
mr
beebe
could
you
help
me
he
looked
amazed
at
the
request
and
said
in
a
low
stern
voice
i
am
more
grieved
than
i
can
possibly
express
it
is
lamentable
lamentable
what
s
wrong
with
the
boy
fired
up
the
other
again
nothing
emerson
except
that
he
no
longer
interests
me
marry
george
miss
honeychurch
he
will
do
he
walked
out
and
left
them
they
heard
him
guiding
his
mother
lucy
the
voices
called
she
turned
to
emerson
in
despair
but
his
face
revived
her
it
was
the
face
of
a
saint
who
understood
now
it
is
all
dark
now
beauty
and
passion
seem
never
to
have
existed
i
know
but
remember
the
mountains
over
florence
and
the
view
ah
dear
if
i
were
george
and
gave
you
one
kiss
it
would
make
you
brave
you
have
to
go
cold
into
a
battle
that
needs
warmth
out
into
the
muddle
that
you
have
made
yourself
and
your
mother
and
all
your
friends
will
despise
you
oh
my
darling
and
rightly
if
it
is
ever
right
to
despise
george
still
dark
all
the
tussle
and
the
misery
without
a
word
from
him
am
i
justified
into
his
own
eyes
tears
came
yes
for
we
fight
for
more
than
love
or
pleasure
there
is
truth
truth
counts
truth
does
you
kiss
me
said
the
girl
you
kiss
me
i
will
he
gave
her
a
sense
of
deities
reconciled
a
feeling
that
in
gaining
the
man
she
loved
she
would
gain
something
for
the
whole
world
throughout
the
squalor
of
her
homeward
drive
she
spoke
at
once
his
salutation
remained
he
had
robbed
the
body
of
its
taint
the
world
s
taunts
of
their
sting
he
had
shown
her
the
holiness
of
direct
desire
she
never
exactly
understood
she
would
say
in
after
years
how
he
managed
to
strengthen
her
it
was
as
if
he
had
made
her
see
the
whole
of
everything
at
chapter
xx
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
the
miss
alans
did
go
to
greece
but
they
went
by
themselves
they
alone
of
this
little
company
will
double
malea
and
plough
the
waters
of
the
saronic
gulf
they
alone
will
visit
athens
and
delphi
and
either
shrine
of
intellectual
song
that
upon
the
acropolis
encircled
by
blue
seas
that
under
parnassus
where
the
eagles
build
and
the
bronze
charioteer
drives
undismayed
towards
infinity
trembling
anxious
cumbered
with
much
digestive
bread
they
did
proceed
to
constantinople
they
did
go
round
the
world
the
rest
of
us
must
be
contented
with
a
fair
but
a
less
arduous
goal
italiam
petimus
we
return
to
the
pension
bertolini
george
said
it
was
his
old
room
no
it
isn
t
said
lucy
because
it
is
the
room
i
had
and
i
had
your
father
s
room
i
forget
why
charlotte
made
me
for
some
he
knelt
on
the
tiled
floor
and
laid
his
face
in
her
lap
george
you
baby
get
why
shouldn
t
i
be
a
baby
murmured
george
unable
to
answer
this
question
she
put
down
his
sock
which
she
was
trying
to
mend
and
gazed
out
through
the
window
it
was
evening
and
again
the
spring
oh
bother
charlotte
she
said
thoughtfully
what
can
such
people
be
made
of
same
stuff
as
parsons
are
made
nonsense
quite
right
it
is
now
you
get
up
off
the
cold
floor
or
you
ll
be
starting
rheumatism
next
and
you
stop
laughing
and
being
so
why
shouldn
t
i
laugh
he
asked
pinning
her
with
his
elbows
and
advancing
his
face
to
hers
what
s
there
to
cry
at
kiss
me
he
indicated
the
spot
where
a
kiss
would
be
welcome
he
was
a
boy
after
all
when
it
came
to
the
point
it
was
she
who
remembered
the
past
she
into
whose
soul
the
iron
had
entered
she
who
knew
whose
room
this
had
been
last
year
it
endeared
him
to
her
strangely
that
he
should
be
sometimes
wrong
any
letters
he
asked
just
a
line
from
now
kiss
me
here
then
then
threatened
again
with
rheumatism
he
strolled
to
the
window
opened
it
as
the
english
will
and
leant
out
there
was
the
parapet
there
the
river
there
to
the
left
the
beginnings
of
the
hills
the
who
at
once
saluted
him
with
the
hiss
of
a
serpent
might
be
that
very
phaethon
who
had
set
this
happiness
in
motion
twelve
months
ago
a
passion
of
gratitude
all
feelings
grow
to
passions
in
the
south
came
over
the
husband
and
he
blessed
the
people
and
the
things
who
had
taken
so
much
trouble
about
a
young
fool
he
had
helped
himself
it
is
true
but
how
stupidly
all
the
fighting
that
mattered
had
been
done
by
others
by
italy
by
his
father
by
his
wife
lucy
you
come
and
look
at
the
cypresses
and
the
church
whatever
its
name
is
still
san
miniato
i
ll
just
finish
your
signorino
domani
faremo
uno
giro
called
the
cabman
with
engaging
certainty
george
told
him
that
he
was
mistaken
they
had
no
money
to
throw
away
on
driving
and
the
people
who
had
not
meant
to
help
the
miss
lavishes
the
cecils
the
miss
bartletts
ever
prone
to
magnify
fate
george
counted
up
the
forces
that
had
swept
him
into
this
contentment
anything
good
in
freddy
s
letter
not
his
own
content
was
absolute
but
hers
held
bitterness
the
honeychurches
had
not
forgiven
them
they
were
disgusted
at
her
past
hypocrisy
she
had
alienated
windy
corner
perhaps
for
ever
what
does
he
say
silly
boy
he
thinks
he
s
being
dignified
he
knew
we
should
go
off
in
the
spring
he
has
known
it
for
six
months
that
if
mother
wouldn
t
give
her
consent
we
should
take
the
thing
into
our
own
hands
they
had
fair
warning
and
now
he
calls
it
an
elopement
ridiculous
boy
signorino
domani
faremo
uno
giro
but
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
he
has
to
build
us
both
up
from
the
beginning
again
i
wish
though
that
cecil
had
not
turned
so
cynical
about
women
he
has
for
the
second
time
quite
altered
why
will
men
have
theories
about
women
i
haven
t
any
about
men
i
wish
too
that
beebe
you
may
well
wish
he
will
never
forgive
us
i
mean
he
will
never
be
interested
in
us
again
i
wish
that
he
did
not
influence
them
so
much
at
windy
corner
i
wish
he
hadn
t
but
if
we
act
the
truth
the
people
who
really
love
us
are
sure
to
come
back
to
us
in
the
long
then
he
said
more
gently
well
i
acted
the
truth
the
only
thing
i
did
do
and
you
came
back
to
me
so
possibly
you
he
turned
back
into
the
room
nonsense
with
that
he
carried
her
to
the
window
so
that
she
too
saw
all
the
view
they
sank
upon
their
knees
invisible
from
the
road
they
hoped
and
began
to
whisper
one
another
s
names
ah
it
was
worth
while
it
was
the
great
joy
that
they
had
expected
and
countless
little
joys
of
which
they
had
never
dreamt
they
were
silent
signorino
domani
faremo
oh
bother
that
man
but
lucy
remembered
the
vendor
of
photographs
and
said
no
don
t
be
rude
to
then
with
a
catching
of
her
breath
she
murmured
mr
eager
and
charlotte
dreadful
frozen
charlotte
how
cruel
she
would
be
to
a
man
like
that
look
at
the
lights
going
over
the
but
this
room
reminds
me
of
charlotte
how
horrible
to
grow
old
in
charlotte
s
way
to
think
that
evening
at
the
rectory
that
she
shouldn
t
have
heard
your
father
was
in
the
house
for
she
would
have
stopped
me
going
in
and
he
was
the
only
person
alive
who
could
have
made
me
see
sense
you
couldn
t
have
made
me
when
i
am
very
happy
she
kissed
him
i
remember
on
how
little
it
all
hangs
if
charlotte
had
only
known
she
would
have
stopped
me
going
in
and
i
should
have
gone
to
silly
greece
and
become
different
for
but
she
did
know
said
george
she
did
see
my
father
surely
he
said
oh
no
she
didn
t
see
him
she
was
upstairs
with
old
beebe
don
t
you
remember
and
then
went
straight
to
the
church
she
said
george
was
obstinate
again
my
father
said
he
saw
her
and
i
prefer
his
word
he
was
dozing
by
the
study
fire
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
there
was
miss
bartlett
a
few
minutes
before
you
came
in
she
was
turning
to
go
as
he
woke
up
he
didn
t
speak
to
then
they
spoke
of
other
things
the
desultory
talk
of
those
who
have
been
fighting
to
reach
one
another
and
whose
reward
is
to
rest
quietly
in
each
other
s
arms
it
was
long
ere
they
returned
to
miss
bartlett
but
when
they
did
her
behaviour
seemed
more
interesting
george
who
disliked
any
darkness
said
it
s
clear
that
she
knew
then
why
did
she
risk
the
meeting
she
knew
he
was
there
and
yet
she
went
to
they
tried
to
piece
the
thing
together
as
they
talked
an
incredible
solution
came
into
lucy
s
mind
she
rejected
it
and
said
how
like
charlotte
to
undo
her
work
by
a
feeble
muddle
at
the
last
but
something
in
the
dying
evening
in
the
roar
of
the
river
in
their
very
embrace
warned
them
that
her
words
fell
short
of
life
and
george
whispered
or
did
she
mean
it
mean
what
signorino
domani
faremo
uno
giro
lucy
bent
forward
and
said
with
gentleness
lascia
prego
lascia
siamo
scusi
tanto
signora
he
replied
in
tones
as
gentle
and
whipped
up
his
horse
buona
sera
e
the
cabman
drove
away
singing
mean
what
george
he
whispered
is
it
this
is
this
possible
i
ll
put
a
marvel
to
you
that
your
cousin
has
always
hoped
that
from
the
very
first
moment
we
met
she
hoped
far
down
in
her
mind
that
we
should
be
like
this
of
course
very
far
down
that
she
fought
us
on
the
surface
and
yet
she
hoped
i
can
t
explain
her
any
other
way
can
you
look
how
she
kept
me
alive
in
you
all
the
summer
how
she
gave
you
no
peace
how
month
after
month
she
became
more
eccentric
and
unreliable
the
sight
of
us
haunted
her
or
she
couldn
t
have
described
us
as
she
did
to
her
friend
there
are
details
it
burnt
i
read
the
book
afterwards
she
is
not
frozen
lucy
she
is
not
withered
up
all
through
she
tore
us
apart
twice
but
in
the
rectory
that
evening
she
was
given
one
more
chance
to
make
us
happy
we
can
never
make
friends
with
her
or
thank
her
but
i
do
believe
that
far
down
in
her
heart
far
below
all
speech
and
behaviour
she
is
it
is
impossible
murmured
lucy
and
then
remembering
the
experiences
of
her
own
heart
she
said
no
it
is
just
youth
enwrapped
them
the
song
of
phaethon
announced
passion
requited
love
attained
but
they
were
conscious
of
a
love
more
mysterious
than
this
the
song
died
away
they
heard
the
river
bearing
down
the
snows
of
winter
into
the
mediterranean
