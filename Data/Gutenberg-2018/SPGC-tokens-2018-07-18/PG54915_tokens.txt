and
great
forests
of
tall
trees
and
tangled
underbrush
darkened
what
are
now
her
bright
plains
and
sunny

there
stood
upon
the
east
bank
of
big
blue
river
a
mile
or
two
north
of
the
point
where
that

was
a

stood
a

with

the

were
so
numerous
that
they
seemed
to
entreat

to
catch
them
and
to
take
them
out

south
of
the
house
stood
a
log
barn
with
room
in
it
for
three
horses
and
two
cows
and
enclosing
this
barn
together
with
a
piece
of
ground
five
or
six
acres
in
extent
was
a
palisade
fence
eight
or
ten
feet
high
made
by
driving
poles
into
the
ground
close
together
in
this
enclosure
the
farmer
kept
his
stock
consisting
of
a
few
sheep
and
cattle
and
here
also
the
chickens
geese
and
ducks
were
driven
at
nightfall
to
save
them
from
varmints
as
all
prowling
animals
were
called
by
the
settlers
the
man
who
had
built
this
log
hut
and
who
lived
in
it
and
owned
the
adjoining
land
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
bore
the
name
of
balser
brent
balser
is
probably
a
corruption
of
baltzer
but
however
that
may
be
balser
was
his
name
and
balser
was
also
the
name
of
his
boy
who
was
the
hero
of
the
bear
stories
which
i
am
about
to
tell
you
brent
and
his
young
wife
had
moved
to
the
blue
river
settlement
from
north
carolina
when
young
balser
was
a
little
boy
five
or
six
years
of
age
they
had
purchased
the
eighty
upon
which
they
lived
from
the
united
states
at
a
sale
of
public
land
held
in
the
town
of
brookville
on
whitewater
and
had
paid
for
it
what
was
then
considered
a
good
round
dollar
per
acre
they
had
received
a
deed
for
their
eighty
from
no
less
a
person
than
james
monroe
then
president
of
the
united
states
this
deed
which
is
called
a
patent
was
written
on
sheepskin
signed
by
the
president
s
own
hand
and
is
still
preserved
by
the
descendants
of
brent
as
one
of
the
to
the
land
it
conveyed
the
house
as
i
have
told
you
consisted
of
two
large
rooms
or
buildings
separated
by
a
passageway
six
or
eight
feet
broad
which
was
roofed
over
but
open
at
both
the
north
and
south
the
back
room
was
the
kitchen
and
the
front
room
was
parlour
bedroom
sitting
room
and
library
all
in
one
at
the
time
when
my
story
opens
little
balser
as
he
was
called
to
distinguish
him
from
his
father
was
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
and
was
the
happy
possessor
of
a
younger
brother
jim
aged
nine
and
a
little
sister
one
year
old
of
whom
he
was
very
proud
indeed
on
the
south
side
of
the
front
room
was
a
large
fireplace
the
chimney
was
built
of
sticks
thickly
covered
with
clay
the
fireplace
was
almost
as
large
as
a
small
room
in
one
of
our
cramped
modern
houses
and
was
broad
and
deep
enough
to
take
in
backlogs
which
were
so
large
and
heavy
that
they
could
not
be
lifted
but
were
drawn
in
at
the
door
and
rolled
over
the
floor
to
the
fireplace
the
prudent
father
usually
kept
two
extra
backlogs
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
ready
to
be
rolled
in
as
the
blaze
died
down
and
on
these
logs
the
children
would
sit
at
night
with
a
rough
slate
made
from
a
flat
stone
and
do
their
ciphering
as
the
study
of
arithmetic
was
then
called
the
fire
usually
furnished
all
the
light
they
had
for
candles
and
dips
being
expensive
luxuries
were
used
only
when
company
was
present
the
fire
however
gave
sufficient
light
and
its
blaze
upon
a
cold
night
extended
up
the
chimney
sending
a
ruddy
cozy
glow
to
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
room
the
back
room
was
the
storehouse
and
kitchen
and
from
the
beams
and
along
the
walls
hung
rich
hams
and
juicy
jerked
venison
dried
apples
onions
and
other
provisions
for
the
winter
there
was
a
glorious
fireplace
in
this
room
also
and
a
crane
upon
which
to
hang
pots
and
cooking
utensils
the
floor
of
the
front
room
was
made
of
logs
split
in
halves
with
the
flat
hewn
side
up
but
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
was
of
clay
packed
hard
and
smooth
the
settlers
had
no
stoves
but
did
their
cooking
in
round
pots
called
dutch
ovens
they
roasted
their
meats
on
a
spit
or
steel
bar
like
the
ramrod
of
a
gun
the
spit
was
kept
turning
before
the
fire
presenting
first
one
side
of
the
meat
and
then
the
other
until
it
was
thoroughly
cooked
turning
the
spit
was
the
children
s
work
south
of
the
palisade
enclosing
the
barn
was
the
tract
of
twenty
or
thirty
acres
of
land
from
which
brent
had
cut
and
burned
the
trees
on
this
clearing
the
stumps
stood
thick
as
the
hair
on
an
angry
dog
s
back
but
the
farmer
ploughed
between
and
around
them
and
each
year
raised
upon
the
fertile
soil
enough
wheat
and
corn
to
supply
the
wants
of
his
family
and
his
stock
and
still
had
a
little
grain
left
to
take
to
brookville
sixty
miles
away
where
he
had
bought
his
land
there
to
exchange
for
such
necessities
of
life
as
could
not
be
grown
upon
the
farm
or
found
in
the
forests
the
daily
food
of
the
family
all
came
from
the
farm
the
forest
or
the
creek
their
sugar
was
obtained
from
the
sap
of
the
their
meat
was
supplied
in
the
greatest
abundance
by
a
few
hogs
and
by
the
inexhaustible
game
of
which
the
forests
were
full
in
the
woods
were
found
deer
just
for
the
shooting
and
squirrels
rabbits
wild
turkeys
pheasants
and
quails
so
numerous
that
a
few
hours
hunting
would
supply
the
table
for
days
the
fish
in
the
river
as
i
told
you
fairly
longed
to
be
caught
one
day
brent
took
down
the
dinner
horn
and
blew
upon
it
two
strong
blasts
this
was
a
signal
that
little
balser
who
was
helping
his
father
down
in
the
clearing
should
come
to
the
house
balser
was
glad
enough
to
drop
his
hoe
and
to
run
home
when
he
reached
the
house
his
mother
said
balser
go
up
to
the
drift
and
catch
a
mess
of
fish
for
dinner
your
father
is
tired
of
deer
meat
three
times
a
day
and
i
know
he
would
like
a
nice
dish
of
fried
redeyes
at
all
right
mother
said
balser
and
he
immediately
took
down
his
and
line
and
got
the
spade
to
dig
bait
when
he
had
collected
a
small
gourdful
of
angleworms
his
mother
called
to
him
you
had
better
take
a
gun
you
may
meet
a
bear
your
father
loaded
the
gun
this
morning
and
you
must
be
careful
in
handling
balser
took
the
gun
which
was
a
heavy
rifle
considerably
longer
than
himself
and
started
up
the
river
toward
the
drift
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
there
had
been
rain
during
the
night
and
the
ground
near
the
drift
was
soft
here
little
balser
noticed
fresh
bear
tracks
and
his
breath
began
to
come
quickly
you
may
be
sure
he
peered
closely
into
every
dark
thicket
and
looked
behind
all
the
large
trees
and
logs
and
had
his
eyes
wide
open
lest
perchance
mr
bear
should
step
out
and
surprise
him
with
an
affectionate
hug
and
thereby
put
an
end
to
little
balser
forever
so
he
walked
on
cautiously
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
somewhat
tremblingly
until
he
reached
the
drift
balser
was
but
a
little
fellow
yet
the
stern
necessities
of
a
settler
s
life
had
compelled
his
father
to
teach
him
the
use
of
a
gun
and
although
balser
had
never
killed
a
bear
he
had
shot
several
deer
and
upon
one
occasion
had
killed
a
wildcat
almost
as
big
as
a
cow
he
said
i
have
no
doubt
the
wildcat
seemed
almost
as
big
as
a
cow
to
balser
when
he
killed
it
for
it
must
have
frightened
him
greatly
as
wildcats
were
sometimes
dangerous
animals
for
children
to
encounter
although
balser
had
never
met
a
bear
face
to
face
and
alone
yet
he
felt
and
many
a
time
had
said
that
there
wasn
t
a
bear
in
the
world
big
enough
to
frighten
him
if
he
but
had
his
gun
illustration
a
wildcat
almost
as
big
as
a
he
had
often
imagined
and
minutely
detailed
to
his
parents
and
little
brother
just
what
he
would
do
if
he
should
meet
a
bear
he
would
wait
calmly
and
quietly
until
his
bearship
should
come
within
a
few
yards
of
him
and
then
he
would
slowly
lift
his
gun
bang
and
bear
would
be
dead
with
a
bullet
in
his
heart
illustration
little
balser
noticed
fresh
bear
tracks
and
his
breath
began
to
come
illustration
fresh
bear
but
when
he
saw
the
fresh
bear
tracks
and
began
to
realize
that
he
would
probably
have
an
opportunity
to
put
his
theories
about
bear
killing
into
practice
he
began
to
wonder
if
after
all
he
would
become
frightened
and
miss
his
aim
then
he
thought
of
how
the
bear
in
that
case
would
be
calm
and
deliberate
and
would
put
theories
into
practice
by
walking
very
politely
up
to
him
and
making
a
very
satisfactory
dinner
of
a
certain
boy
whom
he
could
name
but
as
he
walked
on
and
no
bear
appeared
his
courage
grew
stronger
as
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
enemy
grew
less
and
he
again
began
saying
to
himself
that
no
bear
could
frighten
him
because
he
had
his
gun
and
he
could
and
would
kill
it
so
balser
reached
the
drift
and
having
looked
carefully
about
him
leaned
his
gun
against
a
tree
unwound
his
from
the
pole
and
walked
out
to
the
end
of
a
log
which
extended
into
the
river
some
twenty
or
thirty
feet
here
he
threw
in
his
line
and
soon
was
so
busily
engaged
drawing
out
sun
fish
and
redeyes
and
now
and
then
a
bass
which
was
hungry
enough
to
bite
at
a
worm
that
all
thought
of
the
bear
went
out
of
his
mind
after
he
had
caught
enough
fish
for
a
sumptuous
dinner
he
bethought
him
of
going
home
and
as
he
turned
toward
the
shore
imagine
if
you
can
his
consternation
when
he
saw
upon
the
bank
quietly
watching
him
a
huge
black
bear
if
the
wildcat
had
seemed
as
large
as
a
cow
to
balser
of
what
size
do
you
suppose
that
bear
appeared
a
cow
an
elephant
surely
was
small
compared
with
the
huge
black
fellow
standing
upon
the
bank
illustration
imagine
his
consternation
when
he
saw
upon
the
bank
quietly
watching
him
a
huge
black
it
is
true
balser
had
never
seen
an
elephant
but
his
father
had
and
so
had
his
friend
tom
fox
who
lived
down
the
river
and
they
all
agreed
that
an
elephant
was
purt
nigh
as
big
as
all
the
bear
had
a
peculiar
determined
expression
about
him
that
seemed
to
say
illustration
the
bear
had
a
peculiar
determined
expression
about
that
boy
can
t
get
away
he
s
out
on
the
log
where
the
water
is
deep
and
if
he
jumps
into
the
river
i
can
easily
jump
in
after
him
and
catch
him
before
he
can

a

strokes
he

to
come
off
the
log
in
a
short
time
and
then
i
ll
proceed
to
devour
about
the
same
train
of
thought
had
also
been
rapidly
passing
through
balser
s
mind
his
gun
was
on
the
bank
where
he
had
left
it
and
in
order
to
reach
it
he
would
have
to
pass
the
bear
he
dared
not
jump
into
the
water
for
any
attempt
to
escape
on
his
part
would
bring
the
bear
upon
him
instantly
he
was
very
much
frightened
but
after
all
was
a
little
fellow
for
his
age
so
he
concluded
that
he
would
not
press
matters
as
the
bear
did
not
seem
inclined
to
do
so
but
so
long
as
the
bear
remained
watching
him
on
the
bank
would
stay
upon
the
log
where
he
was
and
allow
the
enemy
to
eye
him
to
his
heart
s
content
there
they
stood
the
boy
and
the
bear
each
eying
the
other
as
though
they
were
the
best
of
friends
and
would
like
to
eat
each
other
which
in
fact
was
literally
true
time
sped
very
slowly
for
one
of
them
you
may
be
sure
and
it
seemed
to
balser
that
he
had
been
standing
almost
an
age
in
the
middle
of
blue
river
on
that
wretched
shaking
log
when
he
heard
his
mother
s
dinner
horn
reminding
him
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
balser
quite
agreed
with
his
mother
and
gladly
would
he
have
gone
i
need
not
tell
you
but
there
stood
the
bear
patient
determined
and
fierce
and
little
balser
soon
was
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
his
time
had
come
to
die
he
hoped
that
when
his
father
should
go
home
to
dinner
and
find
him
still
absent
he
would
come
up
the
river
in
search
of
him
and
frighten
away
the
bear
hardly
had
this
hope
sprung
up
in
his
mind
when
it
seemed
that
the
same
thought
had
also
occurred
to
the
bear
for
he
began
to
move
down
toward
the
shore
end
of
the
log
upon
which
balser
was
standing
slowly
came
the
bear
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
log
which
for
a
moment
he
examined
suspiciously
and
then
to
balser
s
great
alarm
cautiously
stepped
out
upon
it
and
began
to
walk
toward
him
balser
thought
of
the
folks
at
home
and
above
all
of
his
baby
sister
and
when
he
felt
that
he
should
never
see
them
again
and
that
they
would
in
all
probability
never
know
of
his
fate
he
began
to
grow
and
was
almost
paralyzed
with
fear
on
came
the
bear
putting
one
great
paw
in
front
of
the
other
and
watching
balser
intently
with
his
little
black
eyes
his
tongue
hung
out
and
his
great
red
mouth
was
open
to
its
widest
showing
the
sharp
long
glittering
teeth
that
would
soon
be
feasting
on
a
boy
dinner
when
the
bear
got
within
a
few
feet
of
close
he
could
almost
feel
the
animal
s
hot
breath
as
it
slowly
boy
grew
desperate
with
fear
and
struck
at
the
bear
with
the
only
weapon
he
string
of
fish
now
bears
love
fish
and
blackberries
above
all
other
food
so
when
balser
s
string
of
fish
struck
the
bear
in
the
mouth
he
grabbed
at
them
and
in
doing
so
lost
his
foothold
on
the
slippery
log
and
fell
into
the
water
with
a
great
splash
and
plunge
this
was
balser
s
chance
for
life
so
he
flung
the
fish
to
the
bear
and
ran
for
the
bank
with
a
speed
worthy
of
the
cause
illustration
when
the
bear
got
within
a
few
feet
of
balser
the
boy
grew
desperate
with
fear
and
struck
at
the
beast
with
the
only
weapon
he
string
of
when
he
reached
the
bank
his
returned
and
he
remembered
all
the
things
he
had
said
he
would
do
if
he
should
meet
a
bear
the
bear
had
caught
the
fish
and
again
had
climbed
upon
the
log
where
he
was
deliberately
devouring
them
this
was
little
balser
s
chance
for
the
bear
quickly
snatching
up
the
gun
he
rested
it
in
the
fork
of
a
small
tree
near
by
took
deliberate
aim
at
the
bear
which
was
not
five
yards
away
and
shot
him
through
the
heart
the
bear
dropped
into
the
water
dead
and
floated
a
little
way
where
he
lodged
at
a
ripple
a
short
distance
below
balser
after
he
had
killed
the
bear
became
more
frightened
than
he
had
been
at
any
time
during
the
adventure
and
ran
home
screaming
that
afternoon
his
father
went
to
the
scene
of
battle
and
took
the
bear
out
of
the
water
it
was
very
fat
and
large
and
weighed
so
brent
said
over
six
hundred
pounds
balser
was
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
he
himself
was
also
very
fat
and
large
and
weighed
at
least
as
much
as
the
bear
he
was
certainly
entitled
to
feel
big
for
he
had
got
himself
out
of
an
ugly
scrape
in
a
brave
manly
and
manner
and
had
achieved
a
victory
of
which
a
man
might
have
been
proud
the
news
of
balser
s
adventure
soon
spread
among
the
neighbours
and
he
became
quite
a
hero
for
the
bear
he
had
killed
was
one
of
the
largest
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
and
besides
the
gallons
of
rich
bear
oil
it
yielded
there
were
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
of
bear
meat
and
no
other
food
is
more
strengthening
for
winter
diet
there
was
also
the
soft
furry
skin
which
balser
s
mother
tanned
and
with
it
made
a
coverlid
for
balser
s
bed
under
which
he
and
his
little
brother
lay
many
a
cold
night
cozy
and
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
illustration
the
bear
had
caught
the
fish
and
again
had
climbed
upon
the
chapter
ii
how
balser
got
a
gun
for
many
years
after
the
killing
of
the
big
bear
as
told
in
the
preceding
chapter
time
was
reckoned
by
balser
as
beginning
with
that
event
it
was
if
i
may
say
it
his
anno
in
speaking
of
occurrences
events
and
dates
he
always
fixed
them
in
a
general
way
by
saying
that
happened
before
i
killed
the
big
bear
or
that
took
place
after
i
killed
the
big
the
great
immeasurable
eternity
of
time
was
divided
into
two
parts
that
large
unoccupied
portion
preceding
the
death
of
the
big
bear
and
the
part
full
to
overflowing
with
satisfaction
and
pride
after
that
momentous
event
balser
s
adventure
had
raised
him
vastly
in
the
estimation
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
and
what
was
quite
as
good
had
increased
his
respect
for
himself
and
had
given
him
confidence
which
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
qualities
for
boy
or
man
frequently
when
balser
met
strangers
and
the
story
of
the
big
bear
was
told
they
would
pat
the
boy
on
the
shoulder
and
call
him
a
little
man
and
would
sometimes
ask
him
if
he
owned
a
gun
much
to
balser
s
sorrow
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
did
not
the
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
he
owned
a
gun
had
put
into
his
mind
the
thought
of
how
delightful
life
would
be
if
he
but
possessed
one
and
his
favourite
visions
by
day
and
his
sweetest
dreams
by
night
were
all
about
a
gun
one
not
so
long
nor
so
heavy
as
his
father
s
but
of
the
shorter
lighter
pattern
known
as
a
carbine
he
had
heard
his
father
speak
of
this
gun
and
of
its
effectiveness
at
short
range
and
although
at
long
distances
it
was
not
so
true
of
aim
as
his
father
s
gun
still
he
felt
confident
that
if
he
but
possessed
the
coveted
carbine
he
could
and
alone
exterminate
all
the
races
of
bears
wolves
and
wildcats
that
inhabited
the
forests
round
about
and
pestered
the
farmers
with
their
depredations
but
how
to
get
the
gun
that
was
the
question
balser
s
father
had
received
a
gun
as
a
present
from
father
when
balser
had
reached
the
advanced
age
of
and
it
was
considered
a
rich
gift
the
cost
of
a
gun
for
balser
would
equal
half
of
the
sum
total
that
his
father
could
make
during
an
entire
year
and
although
little
balser
looked
forward
in
fond
expectation
to
the
time
when
he
should
be
and
should
receive
a
gun
from
his
father
yet
he
did
not
even
hope
that
he
would
have
one
before
then
however
much
he
might
dream
about
it
dreams
cost
nothing
and
guns
were
expensive
too
expensive
even
to
be
hoped
for
so
balser
contented
himself
with
inexpensive
dreams
and
was
willing
though
not
content
to
wait
but
the
unexpected
usually
happens
at
an
unexpected
time
and
in
an
unexpected
manner
about
the
beginning
of
the
summer
after
the
killing
of
the
big
bear
when
balser
s
father
had
laid
by
his
corn
and
the
little
patch
of
wheat
had
just
begun
to
take
on
a
golden
brown
as
due
notice
that
it
was
nearly
ready
to
be
harvested
there
came
a
few
days
of
idleness
for
the
busy
farmer
upon
one
of
those
rare
idle
days
brent
and
balser
went
down
the
river
on
a
fishing
and
hunting
expedition
there
was
but
one
gun
in
the
family
therefore
balser
could
not
hunt
when
his
father
was
with
him
so
he
took
his
and
did
great
execution
among
the
finny
tribe
while
his
father
watched
along
the
river
for
game
as
it
came
down
to
drink
upon
the
day
mentioned
balser
and
his
father
had
wandered
down
the
river
as
far
as
the
michigan
road
and
brent
had
left
the
boy
near
the
road
fishing
after
telling
him
to
go
home
in
an
hour
or
two
and
that
he
brent
would
go
by
another
route
and
be
home
in
time
for
supper
so
balser
was
left
by
himself
fishing
at
a
deep
hole
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
north
of
the
road
this
was
at
a
time
when
the
river
was
in
flood
and
the
ford
where
travellers
usually
crossed
was
too
deep
for
passage
balser
had
been
fishing
for
an
hour
or
more
and
had
concluded
to
go
home
when
he
saw
approaching
along
the
road
from
the
east
a
man
and
woman
on
horseback
they
soon
reached
the
ford
and
stopped
believing
it
to
be
impassable
they
were
and
and
their
horses
covered
with
froth
were
panting
as
if
they
had
been
urged
to
their
greatest
speed
after
a
little
time
the
gentleman
saw
balser
and
called
to
him
the
boy
immediately
went
to
the
travellers
and
the
gentleman
said
my
little
man
can
you
tell
me
if
it
is
safe
to
attempt
the
ford
at
this
time
it
will
swim
your
horses
answered
balser
i
knew
it
would
said
the
lady
in
evident
distress
she
was
young
and
pretty
and
seemed
to
be
greatly
fatigued
and
frightened
the
gentleman
was
very
attentive
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
in
a
moment
or
two
she
began
to
weep
and
said
they
will
catch
us
i
know
they
will
catch
us
they
can
not
be
more
than
a
mile
behind
us
now
and
we
have
no
place
to
is
some
one
trying
to
catch
you
asked
balser
the
gentleman
looked
down
at
the
little
fellow
for
a
moment
and
was
struck
by
his
bright
manly
air
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
balser
might
suspect
them
of
being
fugitives
from
justice
so
he
explained
yes
my
little
fellow
a
gentleman
is
trying
to
catch
us
he
is
this
lady
s
father
he
has
with
him
a
dozen
men
and
if
they
overtake
us
they
will
certainly
kill
me
and
take
this
lady
home
do
you
know
of
any
place
where
we
may
hide
yes
sir
answered
balser
quickly
help
me
on
behind
you
and
i
ll
take
you
to
my
father
s
house
there
s
no
path
up
the
river
and
if
they
attempt
to
follow
they
ll
get
lost
in
the
balser
climbed
on
the
horse
behind
the
gentleman
and
soon
they
plunged
into
the
deep
forest
and
rode
up
the
river
toward
balser
s
home
the
boy
knew
the
forest
well
and
in
a
short
time
the
little
party
of
three
was
standing
at
the
hospitable
cabin
door
matters
were
soon
explained
to
balser
s
mother
and
she
with
true
hospitality
welcomed
the
travellers
to
her
home
during
the
conversation
balser
learned
that
the
gentleman
and
lady
were
running
away
that
they
might
be
married
and
hoping
to
finish
a
good
job
the
boy
volunteered
the
advice
that
they
should
be
married
that
same
evening
under
his
father
s
roof
he
also
offered
to
go
in
quest
of
a
preacher
who
made
his
home
some
two
miles
to
the
east
the
advice
and
the
offer
of
services
were
eagerly
accepted
and
the
lady
and
gentleman
were
married
that
night
and
remained
a
few
days
at
the
home
of
brent
until
the
river
was
low
enough
to
cross
the
strangers
felt
grateful
to
the
boy
who
had
given
them
such
timely
help
and
asked
him
what
they
could
do
for
him
in
return
balser
hesitated
a
moment
and
said
there
s
only
one
thing
i
want
very
bad
but
that
would
cost
so
much
there
s
no
use
to
speak
of
what
is
it
balser
speak
up
and
if
it
is
anything
i
can
buy
you
shall
have
a
gun
a
gun
a
carbine
i
d
rather
have
it
than
anything
else
in
the
you
shall
have
it
if
there
s
one
to
be
bought
in
indianapolis
we
are
going
there
and
will
return
within
a
week
or
ten
days
and
you
shall
have
your
carbine
if
i
can
find
within
two
weeks
after
this
conversation
balser
was
the
happiest
boy
in
indiana
for
he
owned
a
carbine
ten
pounds
of
fine
powder
and
lead
enough
to
kill
every
living
creature
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
of
course
the
carbine
had
to
be
tested
at
once
so
the
day
after
he
received
it
balser
started
out
with
his
father
on
a
hunting
expedition
fully
determined
in
his
own
mind
to
kill
a
bear
twice
as
large
as
his
first
one
they
took
with
them
and
dried
venison
for
dinner
and
started
east
toward
conn
s
creek
where
the
houses
of
the
settlers
were
thinly
scattered
and
game
plentiful
they
had
with
them
two
faithful
dogs
tige
and
balser
considered
these
dogs
the
most
intelligent
animals
that
walked
on
four
feet
they
were
deerhounds
with
a
cross
of
bulldog
and
were
swift
of
foot
and
very
strong
our
hunters
had
travelled
perhaps
three
or
four
miles
into
the
forest
when
they
started
a
deer
in
pursuit
of
which
the
dogs
bounded
off
with
their
peculiar
bark
and
soon
deer
and
dogs
were
lost
to
sight
balser
and
his
father
listened
carefully
for
the
voices
of
the
dogs
for
should
the
deer
turn
at
bay
the
dogs
instead
of
the
quick
bark
to
which
they
gave
voice
in
the
chase
would
utter
a
howl
half
yelp
the
bay
of
the
hounds
had
died
away
in
the
distance
and
balser
and
his
father
had
heard
nothing
of
them
for
two
or
three
hours
the
hunters
had
seen
other
deer
as
they
walked
along
but
they
had
been
unable
to
obtain
a
shot
smaller
game
was
plentiful
but
balser
and
his
father
did
not
care
to
frighten
away
large
game
by
shooting
at
squirrels
or
birds
so
they
continued
their
walk
until
they
reached
the
bank
of
conn
s
creek
near
the
hour
of
noon
by
that
time
balser
s
appetite
was
beginning
to
call
loudly
for
dinner
and
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
shoot
a
squirrel
which
he
saw
upon
a
limb
of
a
neighbouring
tree
the
squirrel
fell
to
the
ground
and
was
soon
skinned
and
cleaned
balser
then
kindled
a
fire
and
cutting
several
green
twigs
sharpened
the
ends
and
fastened
small
pieces
of
the
squirrel
upon
them
he
next
stuck
the
twigs
in
the
ground
so
that
they
leaned
toward
the
fire
with
the
meat
hanging
directly
over
the
blaze
soon
the
squirrel
was
roasted
to
a
delicious
brown
and
then
balser
served
dinner
to
his
father
who
was
sitting
on
a
rock
near
by
the
squirrel
the
and
the
venison
quickly
disappeared
and
balser
if
permitted
to
do
so
would
have
found
another
squirrel
and
would
have
cooked
it
just
as
dinner
was
finished
there
came
from
a
long
way
the
howling
bark
of
tige
and
prince
telling
plainly
as
if
they
had
spoken
english
that
the
deer
was
at
bay
thereupon
balser
quickly
loaded
his
gun
and
he
and
his
father
looked
carefully
to
their
primings
then
brent
directed
balser
to
climb
down
the
cliff
and
move
toward
the
dogs
through
the
thicket
in
the
bottom
while
he
went
by
another
route
along
the
bluff
should
the
hunters
be
separated
they
were
to
meet
at
an
agreed
place
in
the
forest
balser
climbed
cautiously
down
the
cliff
and
was
soon
deep
in
a
dark
thicket
of
tangled
underbrush
near
the
creek
now
and
then
the
deep
bay
of
the
dogs
reached
his
ears
from
the
direction
whence
he
had
first
heard
it
and
he
walked
as
rapidly
as
the
tangled
briers
and
undergrowth
would
permit
toward
his
faithful
he
was
so
intent
on
the
game
which
he
knew
the
dogs
held
at
bay
that
he
did
not
look
about
him
with
his
accustomed
caution
and
the
result
of
his
unwatchfulness
was
that
he
found
himself
within
ten
feet
of
two
huge
bears
before
he
was
at
all
aware
of
their
presence
they
were
evidently
male
and
female
and
upon
seeing
him
the
great
gave
forth
a
growl
that
frightened
balser
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
retreat
seemed
almost
impossible
and
should
he
fire
at
one
of
the
bears
his
gun
would
be
empty
and
he
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
other
to
attempt
to
outrun
a
bear
even
on
level
ground
would
be
almost
a
hopeless
undertaking
for
the
bear
though
an
creature
is
capable
of
great
speed
when
it
comes
to
a
but
there
where
the
tangled
underbrush
was
so
dense
that
even
walking
through
it
was
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
running
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
thicket
which
would
greatly
impede
balser
would
be
but
small
hindrance
to
the
bears
after
balser
had
killed
the
big
bear
at
the
drift
he
felt
that
he
never
again
would
suffer
from
what
hunters
call
buck
ager
but
when
he
found
himself
confronted
by
those
black
monsters
he
began
to
tremble
in
every
limb
and
for
the
life
of
him
could
not
at
first
lift
his
gun
the
was
the
first
to
move
he
raised
himself
on
his
haunches
and
with
a
deep
growl
started
for
poor
balser
balser
should
have
shot
the
bear
as
he
came
toward
him
but
acting
solely
from
an
instinct
of
he
started
to
run
he
made
better
headway
than
he
had
thought
possible
and
soon
came
to
a
small
open
space
of
ground
where
the
undergrowth
was
not
so
thick
and
where
the
bright
light
of
the
sun
dispelled
the
darkness
the
light
restored
balser
s
confidence
and
the
few
moments
of
retreat
gave
him
time
to
think
and
to
pull
himself
together
so
turning
quickly
he
lifted
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
at
the
bear
which
was
not
two
yards
behind
him
unfortunately
his
aim
was
unsteady
and
his
shot
wounded
the
bear
in
the
neck
but
did
not
kill
him
balser
saw
the
disastrous
failure
he
had
made
and
felt
that
the
bear
would
be
much
surer
in
his
attack
upon
him
than
he
had
been
in
his
attack
upon
the
bear
the
boy
then
threw
away
his
gun
and
again
began
a
hasty
retreat
he
called
for
his
father
and
cried
tige
prince
tige
tige
not
so
much
with
a
hope
that
either
the
dogs
or
his
father
would
hear
but
because
he
knew
not
what
else
to
do
balser
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
still
the
bear
was
at
his
heels
and
the
frightened
boy
expected
every
moment
to
feel
a
stroke
from
the
brute
s
huge
rough
paw
soon
it
came
with
a
stunning
force
that
threw
balser
to
the
ground
upon
his
back
the
bear
was
over
him
in
an
instant
and
caught
his
left
arm
between
his
mighty
jaws
it
seemed
then
that
the
light
of
the
world
went
out
for
a
moment
and
he
remembered
nothing
but
the
huge
mouth
of
the
bear
his
hot
breath
almost
burning
his
cheeks
and
his
deep
terrible
growls
nearly
deafening
his
ears
balser
s
whole
past
life
came
up
before
him
like
a
picture
and
he
remembered
everything
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
he
thought
of
how
deeply
his
dear
father
and
mother
would
grieve
and
for
the
only
time
in
his
life
regretted
having
received
the
carbine
for
it
was
the
gun
after
all
that
had
got
him
into
this
trouble
all
this
happened
in
less
time
than
it
takes
you
to
read
ten
lines
of
this
page
but
it
seemed
very
very
long
to
balser
lying
there
with
the
huge
body
of
the
bear
over
him
illustration
he
could
hear
the
bear
growling
right
at
his
heels
and
it
made
him
just
suddenly
a
note
of
hope
struck
his
sweetest
sound
he
had
ever
heard
it
was
the
yelp
of
dear
old
tige
who
had
heard
his
call
and
had
come
to
the
rescue
if
there
is
any
creature
on
earth
that
a
bear
thoroughly
hates
it
is
a
dog
tige
wasted
not
a
moment
s
time
but
was
soon
biting
and
pulling
at
the
bear
s
hind
legs
the
bear
immediately
turned
upon
the
dog
and
gave
balser
an
opportunity
to
rise
of
this
opportunity
he
quickly
took
advantage
you
may
be
sure
soon
prince
came
up
also
and
in
these
two
strong
dogs
the
bear
had
foemen
worthy
of
his
steel
balser
s
great
danger
and
narrow
escape
had
quickened
all
his
faculties
so
he
at
once
ran
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
dropped
his
gun
and
although
his
left
arm
had
been
terribly
bitten
he
succeeded
in
loading
and
soon
came
back
to
the
help
of
the
dogs
who
had
given
him
such
timely
assistance
the
fight
between
the
dogs
and
the
bear
was
going
on
at
a
merry
rate
when
balser
returned
to
the
scene
of
action
with
prince
on
one
side
and
tige
on
the
other
both
so
strong
and
savage
and
each
quick
and
nimble
as
a
cat
the
bear
had
all
he
could
do
to
defend
himself
and
continually
turned
first
one
way
and
then
another
in
his
effort
to
keep
their
fangs
away
from
his
legs
or
throat
this
enabled
balser
to
approach
within
a
short
distance
of
the
bear
which
he
cautiously
did
taking
care
not
to
wound
either
of
his
faithful
friends
he
was
more
fortunate
in
his
aim
than
he
had
been
the
first
time
and
gave
the
bear
a
mortal
wound
the
wounded
animal
made
a
hasty
retreat
back
into
the
thicket
followed
closely
by
the
dogs
but
balser
had
seen
more
than
enough
of
bear
society
in
the
thicket
and
prudently
concluded
not
to
follow
he
then
loaded
his
gun
with
a
heavy
charge
of
powder
only
and
fired
it
to
attract
his
father
s
attention
this
he
repeated
several
times
until
at
last
he
saw
the
welcome
form
of
his
father
hurrying
toward
him
from
the
bluff
when
his
father
reached
him
and
saw
that
he
had
been
wounded
brent
was
naturally
greatly
troubled
but
balser
said
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
soon
let
s
go
in
after
the
bears
two
of
them
are
in
the
thicket
up
there
next
to
the
cliff
and
the
dogs
have
followed
them
if
tige
had
not
come
up
just
in
time
one
of
the
bears
would
have
killed
me
but
i
think
the
shot
i
gave
him
must
have
killed
him
by
this
so
without
another
word
balser
having
loaded
his
gun
they
started
into
the
dark
thicket
toward
the
cliff
in
the
direction
whence
came
the
voices
of
the
dogs
they
had
not
proceeded
farther
than
a
hundred
yards
when
they
found
the
bear
which
balser
had
shot
lying
dead
in
the
path
over
which
balser
had
so
recently
made
his
desperate
retreat
the
dogs
were
farther
in
toward
the
cliff
where
the
vines
trees
and
brush
grew
so
thick
that
it
was
almost
dark
the
two
hunters
however
did
not
stop
but
hurried
on
to
the
help
of
their
dogs
soon
they
saw
through
the
gloom
of
the
thicket
the
and
about
her
the
dogs
were
prancing
barking
and
snapping
most
furiously
carefully
balser
and
his
father
took
their
position
within
a
few
yards
of
the
bear
and
balser
upon
a
signal
from
his
father
called
off
the
dogs
so
that
a
shot
might
be
made
at
the
bear
without
danger
of
killing
either
tige
or
prince
illustration
tige
was
told
to
go
into
the
soon
the
report
of
two
guns
echoed
through
the
forest
almost
at
the
same
instant
and
the
great
fell
over
on
her
side
quivered
for
a
moment
and
died
this
last
battle
took
place
close
by
the
stone
cliff
which
rose
from
the
to
a
height
of
fifty
or
sixty
feet
balser
and
his
father
soon
worked
their
way
through
the
underbrush
to
where
the
lay
dead
after
having
examined
the
bear
balser
s
attention
was
attracted
to
a
small
opening
in
the
cliff
evidently
the
mouth
of
a
cave
which
had
probably
been
the
home
of
the
bear
family
that
he
and
his
father
had
just
exterminated
the
had
taken
her
stand
at
the
door
of
her
home
and
in
defending
it
had
lost
her
life
balser
examined
the
opening
in
the
cliff
and
concluded
to
enter
but
his
father
said
you
don
t
know
what
s
in
there
let
s
first
send
in
one
of
the
so
tige
was
called
and
told
to
go
into
the
cave
immediately
after
he
had
entered
he
gave
forth
a
series
of
sharp
yelps
which
told
plainly
enough
that
he
had
found
something
worth
barking
at
then
balser
called
the
dog
out
and
brent
collected
pieces
of
dry
wood
and
made
a
fire
in
front
of
the
cave
hoping
to
drive
out
any
animal
that
might
be
on
the
inside
he
more
than
suspected
that
he
would
find
a
pair
of
cubs
as
the
smoke
brought
nothing
forth
he
concluded
to
enter
the
cave
himself
and
learn
what
was
there
dropping
upon
his
knees
he
began
to
crawl
in
at
the
narrow
opening
and
the
boy
and
the
two
dogs
followed
closely
brent
had
taken
with
him
a
lighted
torch
and
when
he
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
into
the
cave
he
saw
in
a
remote
corner
a
pair
of
frowzy
little
cubs
as
fat
and
round
as
a
roll
of
butter
they
were
lying
upon
a
soft
bed
of
leaves
and
grass
which
had
been
collected
by
their
father
and
mother
balser
s
delight
knew
no
bounds
for
next
to
his
gun
what
he
wanted
above
all
things
was
a
bear
cub
and
here
were
two
of
them
quickly
he
and
his
father
each
picked
up
a
cub
and
made
their
way
out
of
the
cave
the
cubs
not
more
than
larger
than
a
cat
were
round
and
very
fat
and
wore
a
coat
of
fur
soft
and
sleek
as
the
finest
silk
young
bears
usually
are
gray
until
after
they
are
a
year
old
but
these
were
an
exception
to
the
rule
for
they
were
almost
black
leaving
the
old
bears
dead
upon
the
ground
balser
and
his
father
hurried
down
to
the
creek
where
brent
washed
and
dressed
his
son
s
wounded
arm
they
then
marked
several
trees
upon
the
bank
of
the
creek
by
breaking
twigs
so
that
they
might
be
able
to
find
the
bears
when
they
returned
that
evening
with
the
horses
to
take
home
the
meat
and
skins
all
this
which
has
taken
so
long
to
tell
occurred
within
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
but
the
work
while
it
lasted
was
hard
and
tiresome
and
although
it
was
but
a
short
time
past
noon
balser
and
his
father
were
only
too
glad
to
turn
their
faces
homeward
each
with
a
saucy
little
bear
cub
under
his
arm
as
we
have
killed
their
mother
said
balser
referring
to
the
cubs
we
must
take
care
of
her
children
and
give
them
plenty
of
milk
and
bring
them
up
to
be
good
honest
the
evening
of
the
same
day
brent
and
a
few
of
his
neighbours
brought
home
the
bear
meat
and
skins
balser
did
not
go
with
his
father
because
his
arm
was
too
sore
he
was
however
very
proud
of
his
wound
and
thought
that
the
glory
of
the
day
and
the
two
bear
cubs
were
purchased
cheaply
enough
after
all
illustration
each
with
a
saucy
little
chapter
iii
lost
in
the
forest
balser
s
arm
mended
slowly
for
it
had
been
terribly
bitten
by
the
bear
the
heavy
sleeve
of
his
buckskin
jacket
had
saved
him
from
a
wound
which
might
have
crippled
him
for
life
but
the
hurt
was
bad
enough
as
it
was
and
balser
passed
through
many
days
and
nights
of
pain
before
it
was
healed
he
bore
the
suffering
like
a
little
man
however
and
felt
very
big
as
he
walked
about
with
his
arm
in
a
buckskin
sling
balser
was
impatient
that
he
could
not
hunt
but
he
spent
his
time
more
or
less
satisfactorily
in
cleaning
and
polishing
his
gun
and
playing
with
the
bear
cubs
which
his
little
brother
jim
had
named
tom
and
the
cubs
soon
became
wonderfully
tame
and
drank
eagerly
from
a
pan
of
milk
they
were
too
small
to
know
how
to
lap
so
the
boys
put
their
hands
in
the
pan
and
held
up
a
finger
at
which
the
cubs
sucked
lustily
it
was
very
laughable
to
see
the
little
round
black
fellows
nosing
in
the
milk
for
the
finger
and
sometimes
they
would
bite
too
until
the
boys
would
snatch
away
their
hands
and
soundly
box
the
cubs
on
the
ears
a
large
panful
of
milk
would
disappear
before
you
could
say
christmas
and
the
bears
silky
sides
would
stand
out
as
big
and
round
as
a
pippin
the
boys
were
always
playing
pranks
upon
the
cubs
and
the
cubs
soon
learned
to
retaliate
they
would
climb
everywhere
about
the
premises
up
the
trees
on
the
roofs
of
the
barn
and
house
and
over
the
fence
their
great
delight
was
the
and
kitchen
where
they
had
their
noses
into
everything
and
made
life
miserable
for
brent
she
would
run
after
them
with
her
broomstick
if
they
but
showed
their
sharp
little
snouts
in
the
doorway
then
off
they
would
scamper
yelping
as
though
they
were
nearly
killed
and
ponder
upon
new
mischief
they
made
themselves
perfectly
at
home
and
would
play
with
each
other
like
a
pair
of
frisky
kittens
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
sod
pretending
to
fight
and
whining
and
growling
as
if
they
were
angry
in
real
earnest
one
day
balser
and
his
little
brother
jim
were
sitting
on
a
log
which
answered
the
purpose
of
a
settee
under
the
eaves
in
front
of
the
house
the
boys
were
wondering
what
had
become
of
tom
and
jerry
as
they
had
not
seen
them
for
an
hour
or
more
and
their
quietness
looked
suspicious
i
wonder
if
those
cubs
have
run
away
said
balser
no
said
jim
bet
they
won
t
run
away
they
ve
got
things
too
comfortable
here
to
run
away
like
as
not
they
re
off
some
place
plannin
to
get
even
with
us
because
we
ducked
them
in
the
water
trough
awhile
ago
they
looked
awful
sheepish
when
they
got
out
and
as
they
went
off
together
i
jus
thought
to
myself
they
were
goin
away
to
think
up
some
trick
on
balser
and
jim
were
each
busily
engaged
eating
the
half
of
a
blackberry
pie
the
eave
of
the
house
was
not
very
high
perhaps
seven
or
eight
feet
from
the
ground
and
balser
and
jim
were
sitting
under
it
holding
the
baby
and
eating
their
pie
hardly
had
jim
spoken
when
the
boys
heard
a
scraping
sound
from
above
then
a
couple
of
sharp
little
yelps
and
down
came
tom
and
jerry
from
the
roof
striking
the
boys
squarely
on
the
head
to
say
that
the
boys
were
frightened
does
not
half
tell
it
they
did
not
know
what
had
happened
they
fell
over
and
the
baby
dropped
to
the
ground
with
a
cry
that
brought
her
mother
to
the
scene
of
action
in
a
moment
the
blackberry
pie
had
in
some
way
managed
to
spread
itself
all
over
the
baby
s
face
and
she
was
a
very
comical
sight
when
her
mother
picked
her
up
the
bears
retaliated
upon
the
boys
sooner
than
even
jim
had
anticipated
and
they
all
had
a
great
laugh
over
it
the
bears
seeming
to
enjoy
it
more
than
anybody
else
the
boys
were
ready
to
admit
that
the
joke
was
on
them
so
they
took
the
cubs
back
to
the
and
gave
them
a
pan
of
rich
milk
as
a
the
scrapes
these
cubs
got
themselves
and
the
boys
into
would
fill
a
large
volume
but
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
about
them
now
as
i
want
to
relate
an
adventure
having
no
fun
in
it
which
befell
balser
and
some
of
his
friends
soon
after
his
arm
was
well
it
was
blackberry
time
and
several
children
had
come
to
balser
s
home
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
raid
upon
a
large
patch
of
wild
blackberries
that
grew
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
s
walk
from
brent
s
cabin
soon
after
daybreak
one
morning
the
little
party
consisting
of
balser
and
jim
tom
fox
and
his
sister
liney
which
is
short
for
and
three
children
from
the
family
of
neigh
paddled
across
the
river
in
a
canoe
which
balser
and
his
father
had
made
from
a
large
gum
log
and
started
westward
for
the
blackberry
patch
tom
and
jerry
had
noticed
the
preparations
for
the
journey
with
considerable
curiosity
and
felt
very
much
hurt
that
they
were
not
to
be
taken
along
but
they
were
left
behind
imprisoned
in
a
pen
which
the
boys
had
built
for
them
and
their
whines
and
howls
of
complaint
at
such
base
treatment
could
be
heard
until
the
children
were
well
out
of
sight
of
the
house
the
party
hurried
along
merrily
little
thinking
that
their
journey
home
would
be
one
of
sadness
and
soon
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
blackberries
picking
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
filling
their
gourds
with
the
delicious
fruit
they
worked
hard
all
the
morning
and
the
deerskin
sacks
which
they
had
brought
with
them
were
nearly
full
toward
noon
the
children
became
hungry
and
without
a
dissenting
voice
agreed
to
eat
dinner
they
had
taken
with
them
for
lunch
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
piece
of
cold
venison
but
balser
suggested
that
he
should
go
into
the
woods
and
find
a
squirrel
or
two
to
help
out
their
meal
in
the
meantime
tom
fox
had
started
out
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
hoping
that
he
too
might
contribute
to
the
larder
in
a
few
minutes
balser
s
gun
was
heard
at
a
distance
and
then
again
and
again
and
soon
he
was
back
in
camp
with
three
fat
squirrels
almost
immediately
after
him
came
tom
fox
carrying
something
in
his
coonskin
cap
what
have
you
there
limpy
cried
liney
the
children
called
tom
limpy
because
he
always
had
a
sore
toe
or
a
stone
bruise
on
his
heel
you
ll
never
guess
answered
tom
all
the
children
took
a
turn
at
guessing
and
then
gave
it
up
turkey
eggs
said
tom
we
ll
have
eggs
as
well
as
squirrel
for
dinner
how
will
you
cook
them
asked
one
of
the
neigh
children
i
ll
show
you
answered
tom
so
now
they
were
guessing
how
limpy
would
cook
the
eggs
but
he
would
not
tell
them
and
they
had
to
give
it
up
the
boys
then
lighted
a
fire
from
the
on
the
gun
and
balser
having
dressed
the
squirrel
cut
twigs
as
he
had
done
when
he
and
his
father
dined
on
conn
s
creek
and
soon
pieces
of
tender
squirrel
were
roasting
near
the
flame
giving
forth
a
most
tempting
odour
in
the
meantime
limpy
had
gone
away
and
none
of
the
children
knew
where
he
was
or
what
he
was
doing
illustration
down
came
tom
and
jerry
from
the
soon
however
he
returned
bearing
a
large
flat
rock
eight
or
ten
inches
in
diameter
and
two
or
three
inches
thick
this
rock
he
carefully
washed
and
scrubbed
in
a
spring
until
it
was
perfectly
clean
he
then
took
coals
from
the
fire
which
balser
had
kindled
and
soon
had
a
great
fire
of
his
own
in
the
midst
of
which
was
the
stone
after
the
blaze
had
died
down
he
made
a
bed
of
hot
coals
on
which
by
means
of
a
couple
of
sticks
he
placed
the
rock
and
then
dusted
away
the
ashes
now
do
you
know
how
i
m
going
to
cook
the
eggs
he
asked
they
of
course
all
knew
and
the
girls
greased
the
rock
with
the
fat
of
the
squirrel
broke
the
eggs
and
allowed
them
to
fall
upon
the
hot
stone
where
they
were
soon
thoroughly
roasted
and
the
children
had
a
delicious
meal
after
dinner
they
sat
in
the
cool
shade
of
the
tree
under
which
they
dined
and
told
stories
and
asked
riddles
for
an
hour
or
two
before
they
again
began
then
they
worked
until
about
six
o
clock
and
stopped
to
have
another
play
before
returning
home
they
played
ring
around
a
rosey
squat
where
ye
be
wolf
dirty
dog
and
then
wound
up
with
the
only
the
children
hid
behind
logs
and
trees
and
in
dense
clumps
of
bushes
the
boys
would
often
climb
trees
when
if
caught
the
one
who
was
it
was
sure
to
run
home
before
the
hider
could
slide
down
his
tree
now
and
then
a
hollow
tree
was
found
and
that
of
course
was
the
best
of
all
beautiful
little
liney
fox
found
one
hollow
tree
too
many
and
as
long
as
they
lived
all
the
children
of
the
party
remembered
it
and
the
terrible
events
that
followed
her
discovery
she
was
seeking
a
place
to
hide
and
had
hurried
across
a
small
open
space
to
conceal
herself
behind
a
huge
sycamore
tree
when
she
reached
the
tree
and
went
around
it
to
hide
upon
the
opposite
side
she
found
it
was
hollow
at
the
root
balser
was
it
and
with
his
eyes
hid
was
counting
one
hundred
as
rapidly
and
loudly
as
he
could
he
had
got
to
sixty
he
afterward
said
when
a
shriek
reached
his
ears
this
was
when
liney
found
the
hollow
tree
balser
at
once
knew
that
it
was
liney
s
voice
for
although
he
was
but
a
little
fellow
he
was
quite
old
enough
to
have
admired
liney
s
exquisite
beauty
and
to
have
observed
that
she
was
as
kind
and
gentle
and
good
as
she
was
pretty
so
what
wonder
that
balser
whom
she
openly
claimed
as
her
best
friend
should
share
not
only
in
the
general
praise
but
should
have
a
boy
s
admiration
for
her
all
his
own
in
persons
accustomed
to
exercise
the
alertness
which
is
necessary
for
a
good
hunter
the
sense
of
locating
the
direction
and
position
from
which
a
sound
proceeds
becomes
highly
developed
and
as
balser
had
been
hunting
almost
ever
since
he
was
large
enough
to
walk
he
knew
instantly
where
liney
was
he
hurriedly
pushed
his
way
through
the
bushes
and
in
a
moment
reached
the
open
space
of
ground
perhaps
one
hundred
yards
across
on
the
opposite
side
of
which
stood
the
tree
that
liney
had
found
some
twenty
or
thirty
yards
beyond
the
tree
stood
liney
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
could
not
move
and
apparently
had
become
powerless
to
scream
balser
hastened
toward
her
at
his
utmost
speed
and
when
he
reached
a
point
from
which
he
could
see
the
hollow
side
of
the
tree
imagine
his
horror
and
fright
upon
beholding
an
enormous
bear
emerging
from
the
opening
the
bear
started
slowly
toward
the
girl
who
seemed
unable
to
move
run
liney
run
for
your
life
screamed
balser
who
fearlessly
rushed
toward
the
bear
to
attract
its
attention
from
the
girl
and
if
possible
to
bring
it
in
pursuit
of
himself
i
just
felt
said
balser
afterward
that
i
wanted
to
lie
down
and
let
the
bear
eat
me
at
once
if
i
could
only
keep
it
away
from
liney
i
shouted
and
threw
clods
and
sticks
at
it
but
on
it
went
toward
her
i
reckon
it
thought
she
was
the
nicest
and
preferred
her
to
me
it
was
right
too
for
she
was
a
heap
the
nicest
and
i
didn
t
blame
the
bear
for
wanting
her
again
i
shouted
run
liney
run
my
voice
seemed
to
waken
her
and
she
started
to
run
as
fast
as
she
could
go
with
the
bear
after
her
and
i
after
the
bear
as
fast
as
i
could
go
i
was
shouting
and
doing
my
best
to
make
the
bear
run
after
me
instead
of
liney
but
it
kept
right
on
after
her
and
she
kept
on
running
faster
and
faster
into
the
dark
woods
in
a
short
time
i
caught
up
with
the
bear
and
kicked
it
on
the
side
as
hard
as
i
could
kick
that
made
it
mad
and
it
turned
upon
me
with
a
furious
growl
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
would
settle
with
me
pretty
quick
and
then
get
liney
after
i
had
kicked
it
i
started
to
run
toward
my
gun
which
was
over
by
the
blackberry
patch
for
a
while
i
could
hear
the
bear
growling
and
puffing
right
at
my
heels
and
it
made
me
just
fly
you
may
be
sure
i
never
ran
so
fast
in
all
my
life
for
i
knew
that
i
could
not
hold
out
long
against
the
bear
and
that
if
i
didn
t
get
my
gun
quick
he
would
surely
get
me
i
did
not
care
as
much
as
you
might
think
nor
was
i
very
badly
frightened
for
i
was
so
glad
i
had
saved
liney
but
naturally
i
wanted
to
save
myself
too
if
possible
so
as
i
have
said
i
ran
as
i
never
ran
since
for
that
matter
soon
the
growls
of
the
bear
began
to
grow
indistinct
and
presently
they
ceased
and
i
thought
i
had
left
it
behind
so
i
kept
on
running
toward
my
gun
and
never
stopped
to
look
back
until
i
heard
another
scream
from
liney
then
i
looked
behind
me
and
saw
that
the
bear
had
turned
and
was
again
after
her
although
she
was
quite
a
distance
ahead
of
it
i
thought
at
first
that
i
should
turn
back
and
kick
the
bear
again
and
just
lie
down
and
let
it
eat
me
if
nothing
else
would
satisfy
it
but
i
was
so
near
my
gun
that
i
concluded
to
get
it
and
then
hurry
back
and
shoot
the
bear
instead
of
kicking
it
i
heard
liney
scream
again
and
heard
her
call
and
that
made
me
run
even
faster
than
the
bear
had
made
me
go
it
was
but
a
few
seconds
until
i
had
my
gun
and
had
started
back
to
help
liney
soon
i
was
at
the
hollow
sycamore
but
the
bushes
into
which
liney
had
run
were
so
thick
and
dark
that
i
could
see
neither
her
nor
the
bear
i
quickly
ran
into
the
woods
where
i
thought
liney
had
gone
and
when
i
was
a
little
way
into
the
thicket
i
called
to
her
but
she
did
not
answer
i
then
went
on
following
the
track
of
the
bear
as
well
as
i
could
bears
you
know
have
long
flat
feet
that
do
not
sink
into
the
ground
and
leave
a
distinct
track
like
a
deer
s
foot
does
so
i
soon
lost
the
bear
tracks
and
did
not
know
which
way
to
go
i
kept
going
however
calling
loudly
for
liney
every
now
and
then
and
soon
i
was
so
deep
into
the
forest
that
it
seemed
almost
night
i
could
not
see
far
in
any
direction
on
account
of
the
thick
underbrush
and
at
a
little
distance
objects
appeared
indistinct
on
i
went
knowing
not
where
calling
liney
liney
at
nearly
every
step
but
i
heard
no
answer
and
it
seemed
that
i
liked
liney
fox
better
than
anybody
in
all
the
world
and
would
have
given
my
life
to
save
after
balser
had
gone
into
the
woods
to
help
liney
the
other
children
gathered
in
a
frightened
group
about
the
tree
under
which
they
had
eaten
dinner
there
they
waited
in
the
greatest
anxiety
and
fear
until
the
sun
had
almost
sunk
below
the
horizon
but
balser
and
liney
did
not
return
shortly
before
dark
the
children
started
homeward
very
and
sorrowful
you
may
be
sure
when
they
reached
the
river
they
paddled
across
and
told
brent
that
balser
and
liney
were
lost
in
the
woods
and
that
when
last
seen
a
huge
bear
was
in
pursuit
of
liney
balser
s
father
lost
not
a
moment
but
ran
to
a
hill
near
the
house
upon
the
top
of
which
stood
a
large
stack
of
dry
grass
leaves
and
wood
placed
there
for
the
purpose
of
signalling
the
neighbours
in
case
of
distress
he
at
once
put
fire
to
the
dry
grass
and
soon
there
was
a
blaze
the
light
from
which
could
be
seen
for
miles
around
brent
immediately
crossed
the
river
and
leaving
tom
fox
behind
to
guide
the
neighbours
walked
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
place
where
balser
and
liney
had
last
been
seen
he
took
with
him
the
dogs
and
a
number
of
torches
which
he
intended
to
light
from
a
if
he
should
need
them
the
neighbours
soon
hurried
to
the
brent
home
in
response
to
the
fire
signal
and
several
of
them
started
out
to
rescue
the
children
if
possible
if
help
were
to
be
given
it
must
be
done
at
once
a
night
in
the
woods
meant
almost
certain
death
to
the
boy
and
girl
for
besides
bears
and
wolves
there
had
been
for
several
weeks
a
strolling
band
of
indians
in
the
neighbourhood
although
the
indians
were
not
brave
enough
to
attack
a
settlement
they
would
be
only
too
ready
to
steal
the
children
did
they
but
have
the
opportunity
these
indians
slept
all
day
in
dark
secluded
spots
and
roamed
about
at
night
visiting
the
houses
of
the
settlers
under
cover
of
darkness
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
off
anything
of
value
upon
which
they
could
lay
their
hands
recently
several
houses
had
been
burned
and
some
twenty
miles
up
the
river
a
woman
had
been
found
murdered
near
the
bank
two
children
were
missing
from
another
house
and
a
man
while
out
hunting
had
been
shot
by
an
unseen
enemy
these
outrages
were
all
justly
attributed
to
the
indians
and
if
they
should
meet
balser
and
liney
in
the
lonely
forest
heaven
itself
only
knew
what
might
become
of
the
children
bear
would
be
a
more
merciful
enemy
all
night
brent
and
the
neighbours
searched
the
forest
far
and
near
afterward
balser
told
the
story
of
that
terrible
night
and
i
will
let
him
speak
i
think
it
was
after
six
o
clock
when
i
went
into
the
woods
in
pursuit
of
liney
and
the
bear
it
was
almost
dark
at
that
time
in
the
forest
and
a
little
later
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
a
fine
drizzle
of
rain
had
begun
to
fall
the
forest
was
so
black
that
once
i
ran
against
a
small
tree
because
i
did
not
see
it
i
wandered
about
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
calling
for
liney
then
i
grew
hopeless
and
began
to
realize
that
i
was
lost
i
could
not
tell
from
which
direction
i
had
come
nor
where
i
was
going
everything
looked
alike
all
about
deep
black
bank
of
nothing
and
a
nameless
fear
stole
over
me
i
had
my
gun
but
of
what
use
was
it
when
i
could
not
see
my
hand
before
me
now
and
then
i
heard
wolves
howling
and
it
seemed
that
their
voices
came
from
every
direction
once
a
black
shadow
ran
by
me
with
a
snarl
and
a
snap
and
i
expected
every
moment
to
have
the
hungry
pack
upon
me
and
to
be
torn
into
pieces
what
if
they
should
attack
liney
the
thought
almost
drove
me
wild
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
had
wandered
through
the
forest
but
it
must
have
been
eight
or
nine
hours
when
i
came
to
the
river
i
went
to
the
water
s
edge
and
put
my
hand
in
the
stream
to
learn
which
way
the
current
ran
for
i
was
so
confused
and
so
entirely
lost
that
i
did
not
know
which
direction
was
i
found
that
the
water
was
running
toward
my
right
and
then
i
climbed
back
to
the
bank
and
stood
in
helpless
confusion
for
a
few
minutes
nothing
could
be
gained
by
standing
there
watching
the
water
like
a
so
i
walked
slowly
down
the
river
i
had
been
going
for
perhaps
twenty
minutes
when
i
saw
a
tall
man
come
out
of
the
woods
a
few
yards
ahead
of
me
and
walk
rapidly
toward
the
river
bank
he
carried
something
on
his
shoulder
as
a
man
would
carry
a
sack
of
wheat
and
when
he
had
reached
the
river
bank
where
there
was
more
light
i
could
see
from
his
dress
that
he
was
an
indian
i
could
not
tell
what
it
was
he
carried
but
in
a
moment
i
thought
of
liney
and
ran
toward
him
i
reached
the
place
where
he
had
gone
down
the
bank
just
in
time
to
see
him
place
his
burden
in
a
canoe
he
himself
was
on
the
point
of
stepping
in
when
i
called
to
him
to
stop
and
told
him
i
would
shoot
him
if
he
did
not
my
fright
was
gone
in
an
instant
and
i
would
not
have
feared
all
the
lions
bears
and
indians
that
roamed
the
wilderness
i
had
but
one
save
liney
and
something
told
me
that
she
lay
at
the
other
end
of
the
canoe
the
open
space
of
the
river
made
it
light
enough
for
me
to
see
the
indian
and
i
was
so
close
to
him
that
even
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
miss
my
aim
in
place
of
answering
my
call
he
glanced
hurriedly
at
me
in
surprise
and
quickly
lifted
his
gun
to
shoot
me
but
i
was
quicker
than
he
and
i
fired
first
the
indian
dropped
his
gun
and
plunged
into
the
river
i
did
not
know
whether
he
had
jumped
or
fallen
in
but
he
immediately
sank
i
thought
i
saw
his
head
a
moment
afterward
above
the
surface
of
the
water
near
the
opposite
bank
and
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
whether
or
not
i
killed
him
at
the
time
i
did
not
care
for
the
one
thing
on
my
mind
was
to
rescue
liney
i
did
not
take
long
to
climb
into
the
canoe
and
sure
enough
there
she
was
at
the
other
end
i
had
not
taken
the
precaution
to
tie
the
boat
to
the
bank
and
i
was
so
overjoyed
at
finding
liney
and
was
so
eager
in
my
effort
to
lift
her
and
to
learn
if
she
were
dead
or
alive
that
i
upset
the
unsteady
thing
i
thought
we
should
both
drown
before
we
could
get
out
for
liney
was
as
helpless
as
if
she
were
dead
which
i
thought
was
really
the
case
after
a
hard
struggle
i
reached
shallow
water
and
carried
liney
to
the
top
of
the
bank
i
laid
her
on
the
ground
and
took
away
the
piece
of
wood
which
the
indian
had
tied
between
her
teeth
to
keep
her
from
crying
out
then
i
rubbed
her
hands
and
face
and
rolled
her
over
and
over
until
she
came
to
after
a
while
she
raised
her
head
and
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
as
if
she
were
in
a
dream
illustration
tige
and
prince
swimming
about
the
canoe
oh
balser
she
cried
and
then
fainted
away
again
i
thought
she
was
dead
this
time
sure
and
was
in
such
agony
that
i
could
not
even
feel
hardly
knowing
what
i
was
doing
i
picked
her
up
to
carry
her
home
i
supposed
i
had
carried
her
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
when
becoming
very
tired
i
stopped
to
rest
then
liney
wakened
up
again
and
i
put
her
down
but
she
could
not
stand
and
of
course
could
not
walk
she
told
me
that
after
she
had
run
into
the
woods
away
from
the
bear
she
became
frightened
and
was
soon
lost
she
had
wandered
aimlessly
about
for
a
long
time
how
long
she
did
not
know
but
it
seemed
ages
she
had
been
so
terrified
by
the
wolves
and
by
the
darkness
that
she
was
almost
unconscious
and
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
said
that
every
now
and
then
she
had
called
my
name
for
she
knew
that
i
would
try
to
follow
her
her
calling
for
me
had
evidently
attracted
the
indian
whom
she
had
met
after
she
had
been
in
the
woods
a
very
long
time
the
indian
seized
her
and
placed
the
piece
of
wood
between
her
teeth
to
keep
her
from
screaming
he
then
threw
her
over
his
shoulder
and
she
remembered
very
little
of
what
happened
after
that
until
she
was
awakened
in
the
canoe
by
the
flash
and
the
report
of
my
gun
she
said
that
she
knew
at
once
i
had
come
and
then
she
knew
nothing
more
until
she
awakened
on
the
bank
she
did
not
know
of
the
upsetting
of
the
canoe
nor
of
my
struggle
in
the
water
but
when
i
told
her
about
it
she
said
balser
you
ve
saved
my
life
three
times
in
one
then
i
told
her
that
i
would
carry
her
home
she
did
not
want
me
to
though
and
tried
to
walk
but
could
not
so
i
picked
her
up
and
started
homeward
just
then
i
happened
to
look
toward
the
river
and
saw
the
indian
s
canoe
floating
bottom
upward
i
saw
at
once
that
here
was
an
opportunity
for
us
to
ride
home
so
i
put
liney
down
took
off
my
wet
jacket
and
moccasins
and
swam
out
to
the
canoe
after
i
had
drawn
it
to
the
bank
and
had
turned
out
the
water
i
laid
liney
at
the
bow
found
a
pole
with
which
to
guide
the
canoe
climbed
in
myself
and
pushed
off
we
floated
very
slowly
but
slow
as
it
was
it
was
a
great
deal
better
than
having
to
walk
it
was
just
beginning
to
be
daylight
when
i
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
i
would
have
known
their
voices
among
ten
thousand
for
they
were
as
familiar
to
me
as
the
voice
of
my
mother
it
was
dear
old
tige
and
prince
and
never
in
my
life
was
any
voice
more
welcome
to
my
ears
than
that
sweet
sound
i
whistled
shrilly
between
my
fingers
and
soon
the
faithful
animals
came
rushing
out
of
the
woods
and
plunged
into
the
water
swimming
about
us
as
if
they
knew
as
well
as
a
man
could
have
known
what
they
and
their
master
had
been
looking
for
all
balser
s
father
had
followed
closely
upon
the
dogs
and
within
an
hour
the
children
were
home
amid
the
wildest
rejoicing
you
ever
heard
when
liney
became
stronger
she
told
how
she
had
seen
the
hollow
in
the
sycamore
tree
and
had
hurried
toward
it
to
hide
and
how
just
as
she
was
about
to
enter
the
hollow
tree
a
huge
bear
raised
upon
its
haunches
and
thrust
its
nose
almost
in
her
face
she
said
that
the
bear
had
followed
her
for
a
short
distance
and
then
for
some
reason
had
given
up
the
chase
her
recollection
of
everything
that
had
happened
was
confused
and
indistinct
but
one
little
fact
she
remembered
with
a
clearness
that
was
very
curious
the
bear
she
said
had
but
one
ear
when
balser
heard
this
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
gave
notice
to
all
persons
present
that
there
would
soon
be
a
bear
funeral
and
that
a
bear
would
be
at
the
head
of
the
procession
he
would
have
the
other
ear
of
that
bear
if
he
had
to
roam
the
forest
until
he
was
an
old
man
to
find
it
how
he
got
it
and
how
it
got
him
i
will
tell
you
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iv
the
bear
you
tom
you
jerry
come
here
called
balser
one
morning
while
he
and
jim
were
sitting
in
the
shade
near
the
river
in
front
of
the
house
overseeing
the
baby
you
tom
you
jerry
called
balser
a
second
time
with
emphasis
the
cubs
snoozing
in
the
sun
a
couple
of
paces
away
rolled
lazily
over
two
or
three
times
in
an
effort
to
get
upon
their
feet
and
then
trotted
to
their
masters
with
a
comical
waddling
gait
that
always
set
the
boys
laughing
was
such
a
swagger
when
they
had
come
balser
said
stop
right
there
and
the
cubs
being
always
tired
gladly
enough
sat
upon
their
haunches
and
blinked
sleepily
into
balser
s
face
with
a
greedy
expression
upon
their
own
as
if
to
say
well
where
s
the
milk
milk
is
it
asked
balser
you
re
always
hungry
you
re
nothing
but
a
pair
of
gluttons
eat
eat
from
morning
until
night
well
this
time
you
ll
get
nothing
there
s
no
milk
for
the
cubs
looked
disgusted
so
jim
said
and
no
doubt
he
was
right
for
jim
and
the
cubs
were
great
friends
and
understood
each
other
thoroughly
now
i
ve
been
a
good
father
to
you
said
balser
i
ve
always
given
you
as
much
milk
as
you
could
hold
without
bursting
and
have
tried
to
bring
you
up
to
be
good
respectable
bears
and
to
do
my
duty
by
you
i
have
whipped
you
whenever
you
needed
it
although
it
often
hurt
me
worse
than
it
did
the
bears
grunted
as
if
to
say
but
not
in
the
same
now
what
i
want
continued
balser
regardless
of
the
interruption
is
that
you
tell
me
what
you
know
if
anything
concerning
a
big
bear
that
lives
hereabouts
have
you
ever
heard
of
him
tom
gave
a
grunt
and
jim
who
had
been
studying
bear
language
said
he
meant
jerry
then
put
his
nose
to
tom
s
ear
and
whined
something
in
a
low
voice
what
does
he
say
jim
asked
balser
he
says
for
tom
not
to
tell
you
anything
until
you
promise
to
give
them
milk
answered
jim
seriously
jerry
you
re
the
greatest
glutton
alive
i
do
believe
said
balser
but
if
you
ll
tell
me
anything
worth
knowing
about
the
bear
i
ll
give
you
the
biggest
pan
of
milk
you
ever
jerry
in
his
glee
took
two
or
three
fancy
steps
awkwardly
fell
over
himself
a
couple
of
times
got
up
and
grunted
to
tom
to
go
ahead
jim
was
the
interpreter
and
tom
grunted
and
whined
away
in
a
mighty
effort
to
earn
the
milk
the
bear
said
he
is
my
uncle
used
to
hear
dad
and
mother
talk
about
him
dad
bit
his
ear
off
that
s
how
he
came
to
have
only
one
dad
and
he
fought
about
mother
and
when
dad
bit
uncle
s
ear
off
mother
went
with
dad
and
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
other
fellow
couldn
t
abide
a
husband
she
that
s
interesting
answered
balser
where
does
he
live
tom
pointed
his
nose
toward
the
northwest
and
opened
his
mouth
very
wide
up
that
way
in
a
cave
interpreted
jim
pointing
as
the
cub
had
indicated
how
far
is
it
asked
balser
jerry
lay
down
and
rolled
over
twice
two
hours
walk
said
jim
how
shall
i
find
the
place
asked
balser
tom
stood
upon
his
hind
legs
and
scratched
the
bark
of
a
tree
with
his
fore
paws
as
high
as
he
could
reach
of
course
said
balser
by
the
bear
scratches
on
the
trees
i
jerry
grunted
milk
so
jim
said
and
the
whole
party
boys
bears
and
baby
moved
off
to
the
where
the
cubs
had
a
great
feast
after
the
milk
had
disappeared
jerry
grew
talkative
and
grunted
away
like
the
satisfied
little
pig
that
he
was
again
jim
with
a
serious
face
acted
as
interpreter
mighty
bad
bear
said
jerry
soured
on
the
world
since
mother
threw
him
over
won
t
have
anything
to
do
with
anybody
he
s
as
big
and
strong
as
a
horse
fierce
as
a
lion
and
meaner
than
an
injun
he
s
bewitched
too
with
an
evil
spirit
and
nobody
can
ever
kill
that
s
the
name
he
has
among
white
folks
remarked
balser
better
be
careful
when
you
hunt
him
for
he
s
killed
more
men
and
boys
than
you
have
fingers
and
toes
said
tom
then
the
cubs
being
full
of
milk
and
drowsy
stretched
themselves
out
in
the
sun
and
no
amount
of
persuasion
could
induce
them
to
utter
another
grunt
the
bears
had
told
the
is
if
they
had
told
anything
for
since
it
had
been
learned
throughout
the
settlement
that
it
was
a
bear
which
had
pursued
liney
many
stories
had
been
told
of
hairbreadth
escapes
and
thrilling
adventures
with
that
same
fierce
prowler
of
the
woods
one
hunter
said
that
he
had
shot
at
him
as
many
as
twenty
times
at
short
range
but
for
all
he
knew
had
never
even
wounded
him
the
bear
could
not
be
caught
by
any
means
whatsoever
he
had
broken
many
traps
and
had
stolen
bait
so
frequently
from
others
that
he
was
considered
altogether
too
knowing
for
a
natural
bear
and
it
was
thought
that
he
was
inhabited
by
an
evil
spirit
which
gave
him
supernatural
powers
he
certainly
was
a
very
shrewd
old
fellow
and
very
strong
and
fierce
and
even
among
those
of
the
settlers
who
were
not
superstitious
enough
to
believe
that
he
was
inhabited
by
an
evil
spirit
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
rogue
bear
that
is
a
sullen
morose
old
fellow
who
lived
by
himself
as
old
bachelors
live
the
bachelors
though
being
men
should
know
better
and
act
more
wisely
notwithstanding
all
these
evil
reports
concerning
the
bear
balser
clung
to
his
resolution
to
hunt
the
bear
to
kill
him
if
possible
and
to
give
liney
the
remaining
ear
as
a
keepsake
balser
s
father
knew
that
it
was
a
perilous
undertaking
and
tried
to
persuade
the
boy
to
hunt
some
less
dangerous
game
but
he
would
not
listen
to
any
of
the
warnings
and
day
by
day
longed
more
ardently
for
the
blood
of
the
bear
so
one
morning
shortly
after
the
conversation
with
the
cubs
balser
shouldered
his
gun
and
set
out
toward
the
northwest
accompanied
by
limpy
fox
and
the
dogs
in
truth
the
expedition
had
been
delayed
that
limpy
s
sore
might
that
was
one
of
liney
s
jokes
limpy
had
no
gun
but
he
fairly
bristled
with
knives
and
a
hatchet
which
for
several
days
he
had
been
grinding
and
whetting
until
they
were
almost
as
sharp
as
a
razor
the
boys
roamed
through
the
forest
all
day
long
but
found
no
trace
of
the
bear
nor
of
any
other
for
that
matter
so
toward
evening
they
turned
their
faces
homeward
where
they
arrived
soon
after
sunset
very
tired
and
hungry
liney
had
walked
over
to
balser
s
house
to
learn
the
fate
of
the
bear
and
fully
expected
to
hear
that
he
had
been
slaughtered
for
she
looked
upon
balser
as
a
second
saint
hubert
who
as
you
know
is
the
patron
saint
of
hunters
one
failure
however
did
not
shake
her
faith
in
balser
nor
did
it
affect
his
resolution
to
kill
the
bear
next
day
the
boys
again
went
hunting
and
again
failed
to
find
the
bear
they
sought
they
then
rested
for
a
few
days
and
tried
again
with
still
another
failure
after
several
days
of
fruitless
tramping
through
the
forests
their
friends
began
to
laugh
at
them
if
he
ever
catches
sight
of
tom
said
liney
he
ll
certainly
die
for
tom
s
knives
and
hatchet
would
frighten
any
bear
to
balser
also
made
sport
of
tom
s
armament
but
tom
a
little
miffed
said
you
needn
t
be
so
smart
it
hasn
t
been
long
since
you
had
nothing
but
a
hatchet
you
think
because
you
ve
got
a
gun
you
re
very
big
and
cute
i
ll
bet
the
time
will
come
when
you
ll
be
glad
enough
that
i
have
a
tom
was
a
truer
prophet
than
he
thought
for
the
day
soon
came
when
the
hatchet
proved
itself
true
steel
the
boys
had
started
out
before
one
morning
and
were
deep
into
the
forest
when
daylight
was
fairly
abroad
tige
and
prince
were
with
them
and
were
trotting
lazily
along
at
the
boys
heels
for
the
day
was
very
warm
and
there
was
no
breeze
in
the
forest
they
had
been
walking
for
several
hours
and
had
almost
lost
hope
when
suddenly
a
deep
growl
seemed
to
come
from
the
ground
almost
at
their
feet
the
boys
sprang
back
in
a
hurry
for
right
in
their
path
stood
an
enormous
bear
where
a
moment
before
there
had
been
nothing
lordy
it
s
the
bear
cried
tom
and
the
hairs
on
his
head
fairly
stood
on
end
my
what
a
monster
of
fierceness
the
bear
was
his
head
throat
and
paws
were
covered
with
blood
evidently
from
some
animal
that
he
had
been
eating
and
his
great
red
mouth
sharp
white
teeth
and
cropped
ear
gave
him
a
most
ferocious
and
terrifying
appearance
balser
s
first
impulse
now
that
he
had
found
the
bear
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
to
retreat
that
was
tom
s
first
impulse
also
and
notwithstanding
his
knives
and
hatchet
he
acted
upon
it
quicker
than
a
circus
clown
can
turn
a
somersault
balser
also
started
to
run
but
thought
better
of
it
and
turned
to
give
battle
to
the
bear
fully
determined
to
act
slowly
and
deliberately
and
to
make
no
mistake
about
his
aim
illustration
lordy
balser
it
s
the
he
knew
that
a
false
aim
would
end
his
own
days
and
would
add
one
more
victim
to
the
already
long
list
of
the
bear
the
dogs
barked
furiously
at
the
bear
and
did
not
give
balser
an
opportunity
to
shoot
the
bear
and
dogs
were
gradually
moving
farther
away
from
balser
and
almost
before
he
knew
it
the
three
had
disappeared
in
the
thicket
balser
was
loath
to
follow
until
tom
should
return
so
he
called
in
an
undertone
tom
limpy
soon
tom
cautiously
came
back
peering
fearfully
about
him
hatchet
in
hand
ready
to
do
great
execution
upon
the
afterward
said
you
re
a
pretty
hunter
you
are
you
d
better
go
home
and
get
an
ax
the
bear
has
got
away
just
because
i
had
to
wait
for
you
said
balser
only
too
glad
to
have
some
one
to
blame
for
the
bear
s
escape
the
boys
still
heard
the
dogs
barking
and
hurried
on
after
them
as
rapidly
as
the
tangle
of
undergrowth
would
permit
now
and
then
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
bear
only
to
lose
it
again
as
he
ran
down
a
ravine
or
through
a
dense
thicket
the
dogs
however
kept
in
close
pursuit
and
loudly
called
to
their
master
to
notify
him
of
their
whereabouts
the
boys
and
bears
played
at
this
exciting
game
of
for
two
or
three
hours
but
balser
had
no
opportunity
for
a
good
shot
and
tom
found
no
chance
to
use
his
deadly
hatchet
when
the
bear
showed
a
disposition
to
run
away
rather
than
to
fight
limpy
grew
brave
and
talked
himself
into
a
high
state
of
heroism
it
was
an
hour
past
noon
and
the
boys
were
laboriously
climbing
a
steep
ascent
in
pursuit
of
the
bear
and
dogs
which
they
could
distinctly
see
a
few
yards
ahead
of
them
at
the
top
of
a
hill
the
underbrush
had
become
thinner
although
the
shadow
of
the
trees
was
deep
and
dark
and
balser
thought
that
at
last
the
bear
was
his
he
repeated
over
and
over
to
himself
his
father
s
advice
when
you
attack
a
bear
be
slow
and
deliberate
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
don
t
shoot
until
you
re
sure
of
your
he
remembered
vividly
his
hasty
shot
when
he
wounded
the
bear
on
conn
s
creek
and
his
narrow
escape
from
death
at
that
time
had
so
impressed
upon
him
the
soundness
of
his
father
s
advice
that
he
repeated
it
night
and
morning
with
his
prayers
when
he
saw
the
bear
at
the
top
of
the
hill
so
close
to
him
he
raised
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
held
it
there
for
a
moment
awaiting
a
chance
for
a
sure
shot
but
disappointment
instead
of
the
bear
was
his
for
while
he
held
his
gun
ready
to
fire
the
bear
suddenly
disappeared
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
and
swallowed
him
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
even
the
dogs
looked
astonished
surely
this
a
demon
bear
the
boys
hurried
to
the
spot
where
they
had
last
seen
the
animal
and
although
they
carefully
searched
for
the
mouth
of
a
cave
or
burrow
through
which
the
bear
might
have
escaped
they
saw
none
but
found
the
earth
everywhere
solid
and
firm
they
extended
their
search
for
a
hundred
feet
or
more
about
them
but
still
with
the
same
result
they
could
find
no
hole
or
opening
into
which
the
bear
could
possibly
have
entered
his
mysterious
disappearance
right
before
their
eyes
seemed
terribly
uncanny
there
was
certainly
something
wrong
with
the
bear
he
had
sprung
from
the
ground
just
at
their
feet
where
a
moment
before
there
had
been
nothing
and
now
he
had
as
mysteriously
disappeared
into
the
solid
earth
and
had
left
no
trace
behind
him
balser
and
tom
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
greatest
amazement
and
all
they
had
heard
about
the
evil
spirit
which
inhabited
the
bear
quickly
flashed
through
their
minds
we
d
better
let
him
go
balser
said
tom
for
we
ll
never
kill
him
that
s
sure
he
s
been
leading
us
a
chase
all
the
morning
only
to
get
us
up
here
to
kill
us
i
never
saw
such
an
awful
place
for
darkness
the
bushes
and
trees
don
t
seem
natural
they
all
have
thorns
and
great
knots
on
them
and
their
limbs
and
twigs
look
like
huge
bony
arms
and
fingers
reaching
out
after
us
i
tell
you
this
ain
t
a
natural
place
and
that
bear
is
an
evil
spirit
as
sure
as
you
live
lordy
let
s
get
out
of
here
for
i
never
was
so
scared
in
my
balser
was
also
afraid
but
tom
s
words
had
made
him
wish
to
appear
brave
and
he
said
shucks
limpy
i
hope
you
ain
t
afraid
when
you
have
your
for
goodness
sake
don
t
joke
in
such
a
place
as
this
balser
said
tom
with
chattering
teeth
i
m
not
afraid
of
any
natural
bear
when
i
have
my
hatchet
but
a
bewitched
bear
is
too
much
for
me
and
i
m
not
ashamed
to
own
how
do
you
know
he
s
bewitched
asked
balser
trying
to
talk
himself
out
of
his
own
fears
bewitched
didn
t
he
come
right
out
of
the
ground
just
at
our
very
feet
and
didn
t
he
sink
into
the
solid
earth
right
here
before
our
eyes
what
more
do
you
want
i
d
like
to
know
just
you
try
to
sink
into
the
ground
and
see
if
you
can
nobody
can
unless
he
s
balser
felt
in
his
heart
that
tom
told
the
truth
and
as
even
the
dogs
seemed
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
dark
mysterious
place
they
all
descended
the
hill
on
the
side
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
ascended
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
they
unexpectedly
found
that
they
were
at
the
river
s
edge
and
after
taking
a
drink
they
turned
their
faces
toward
home
they
thought
of
dinner
but
their
appetite
had
been
frightened
away
by
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
bear
and
they
did
not
care
to
eat
so
they
fed
the
dogs
and
again
started
homeward
down
the
river
after
a
few
minutes
walking
they
came
to
a
bluff
several
hundred
feet
long
and
perhaps
fifty
feet
high
which
at
that
time
the
water
being
low
was
separated
from
the
river
by
a
narrow
strip
of
rocky
muddy
ground
illustration
let
s
get
out
of
this
strip
of
ground
was
overgrown
with
reeds
and
willows
and
the
bluff
was
covered
with
vines
and
bushes
which
clung
in
green
masses
to
its
steep
sides
and
completely
hid
the
rocks
and
earth
tom
was
in
front
balser
came
next
and
the
dogs
dead
tired
were
trailing
along
some
distance
behind
suddenly
tom
threw
up
his
hands
and
jumped
frantically
backward
exclaiming
in
terrified
tones
oh
lord
the
bear
when
tom
jumped
backward
his
foot
caught
in
a
vine
and
he
fell
violently
against
balser
throwing
them
both
to
the
ground
in
falling
tom
dropped
his
hatchet
which
he
had
snatched
from
his
belt
and
balser
dropped
his
gun
the
lock
of
which
struck
a
stone
and
caused
the
charge
to
explode
thus
the
boys
were
on
their
backs
and
weaponless
while
the
bear
stood
almost
within
arm
s
length
growling
in
a
voice
like
distant
thunder
and
looking
so
horrid
and
fierce
that
he
seemed
a
very
demon
in
a
bear
s
skin
tom
and
balser
were
so
frightened
that
for
a
moment
they
could
not
move
but
the
deep
growls
which
terrified
them
also
brought
the
dogs
who
came
quickly
to
the
rescue
barking
furiously
the
bear
sprang
upon
the
boys
just
as
the
dogs
came
up
and
balser
received
the
full
force
of
a
great
flat
horny
paw
upon
his
back
and
was
almost
stunned
the
long
sharp
claws
of
the
bear
tore
through
the
buckskin
jacket
as
if
it
were
paper
and
cut
deep
gashes
in
balser
s
flesh
the
pain
seemed
to
revive
him
from
the
benumbing
effect
of
the
stroke
and
when
the
bears
attention
was
attracted
by
the
dogs
balser
crawled
out
from
beneath
the
monster
and
arose
to
his
feet
wounded
bloody
and
dizzy
tom
also
felt
the
force
of
the
bear
s
great
paw
and
was
lying
a
few
feet
from
balser
with
his
head
in
a
tangle
of
vines
and
reeds
balser
having
escaped
from
under
the
bear
the
brute
turned
upon
tom
who
was
lying
prostrate
in
the
bushes
the
dogs
were
still
vigorously
fighting
the
bear
and
every
second
or
two
a
stroke
from
the
powerful
paw
brought
a
sharp
yelp
of
pain
from
either
tige
or
prince
and
left
its
mark
in
deep
red
gashes
upon
their
bodies
the
pain
however
did
not
deter
the
faithful
animals
from
their
efforts
to
rescue
the
boys
and
while
the
bear
was
making
for
tom
it
was
kept
busy
in
defending
itself
from
the
dogs
in
an
instant
the
bear
reached
tom
who
would
have
been
torn
in
pieces
at
once
had
not
balser
quickly
unsheathed
his
long
hunting
knife
and
rushed
into
the
fight
he
sprang
for
the
bear
and
landed
on
his
back
clinging
to
him
with
one
arm
about
his
neck
while
with
the
other
he
thrust
his
sharp
hunting
knife
almost
to
the
hilt
into
the
brute
s
side
this
turned
the
attack
from
tom
and
brought
it
upon
balser
who
soon
had
his
hands
full
again
the
bear
rose
upon
his
hind
feet
and
before
balser
could
take
a
step
in
retreat
caught
him
in
his
mighty
arms
for
the
purpose
of
hugging
him
to
death
which
is
a
bear
s
favourite
method
of
doing
battle
the
hunting
knife
was
still
sticking
in
the
rough
black
side
of
the
bear
where
balser
had
thrust
it
and
blood
flowed
from
the
wound
in
a
great
stream
the
dogs
were
biting
at
the
bear
s
hind
legs
but
so
intent
was
the
infuriated
monster
upon
killing
balser
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
but
permitted
them
to
work
their
pleasure
upon
him
while
he
was
having
the
satisfaction
of
squeezing
the
life
out
of
the
boy
in
the
meantime
tom
recovered
and
rose
to
his
feet
he
at
once
realized
that
balser
would
be
a
dead
boy
if
something
were
not
done
immediately
luckily
tom
saw
his
hatchet
lying
a
few
feet
away
and
snatching
it
up
he
attacked
the
bear
chopping
away
at
his
great
back
as
if
it
were
a
tree
at
the
third
or
fourth
stroke
from
tom
s
hatchet
the
bear
loosened
his
grip
upon
balser
and
fell
in
a
great
black
heap
to
the
ground
growling
and
clawing
in
all
directions
as
if
he
were
frantic
with
rage
and
pain
he
bit
at
the
rocks
and
bushes
gnashed
his
teeth
and
dug
into
the
ground
with
his
claws
balser
when
released
from
the
bear
fell
in
a
half
conscious
condition
close
to
the
river
s
edge
tom
ran
to
him
and
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
dashed
water
in
his
face
to
remove
the
and
to
wash
the
wounds
the
water
soon
revived
balser
who
rose
to
his
feet
and
tom
helping
his
friend
the
boys
started
to
run
or
rather
to
walk
away
as
fast
as
their
wounds
and
bruises
would
permit
while
the
dogs
continued
to
bark
and
the
bear
to
growl
as
the
boys
were
retreating
tom
turned
his
head
to
see
if
the
bear
was
following
but
as
it
was
still
lying
on
the
ground
growling
and
biting
at
the
rocks
and
scratching
the
earth
he
thought
perhaps
that
the
danger
was
over
and
that
the
bear
was
so
badly
wounded
that
he
could
not
rise
or
he
certainly
would
have
been
on
his
feet
fighting
tige
and
prince
who
gave
him
not
one
moment
s
peace
balser
and
tom
paused
for
an
instant
and
were
soon
convinced
that
the
bear
was
helpless
i
believe
he
can
t
get
up
said
balser
of
course
he
can
t
answered
tom
pompously
i
cut
his
old
backbone
in
two
with
my
hatchet
when
he
was
hugging
you
i
chopped
away
at
him
hard
enough
to
cut
down
a
hickory
the
boys
limped
back
to
the
scene
of
conflict
and
found
that
they
were
right
the
bear
could
not
rise
to
his
feet
but
lay
in
a
huge
struggling
black
heap
on
the
ground
balser
then
cautiously
went
over
to
where
his
gun
lay
picked
it
up
and
ran
back
to
tom
he
tried
to
load
the
gun
but
his
arms
were
so
bruised
and
torn
that
he
could
not
so
he
handed
it
to
tom
who
loaded
it
with
a
large
bullet
and
a
heavy
charge
of
powder
balser
then
called
off
the
dogs
and
tom
as
proud
as
the
president
of
the
united
states
held
the
gun
within
a
yard
of
the
bear
s
head
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
great
brute
rolled
over
on
his
side
his
mighty
limbs
quivered
he
uttered
a
last
despairing
growl
which
was
it
was
almost
a
his
fierce
turbulent
spirit
fled
forever
balser
then
drew
his
hunting
knife
from
the
bear
s
body
cut
off
the
remaining
ear
and
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
buckskin
coat
the
boys
were
sorely
wounded
and
balser
said
that
the
bear
had
squeezed
his
insides
out
of
place
this
proved
to
be
true
to
a
certain
extent
for
when
he
got
home
it
was
found
that
two
of
his
ribs
were
broken
the
young
hunters
were
only
too
glad
to
start
homeward
for
they
had
seen
quite
enough
of
the
bear
for
one
day
after
walking
in
silence
a
short
distance
down
the
river
balser
said
to
tom
i
ll
never
again
say
anything
bad
about
your
hatchet
it
saved
my
life
and
was
worth
all
the
guns
in
the
world
in
such
a
fight
as
we
have
just
gone
tom
laughed
but
was
enough
not
to
say
i
told
you
you
may
imagine
the
fright
the
boys
gave
their
parents
when
they
arrived
home
wounded
limping
and
but
soon
all
was
told
and
balser
and
tom
were
the
heroes
of
the
settlement
they
had
killed
the
most
dangerous
animal
that

emerge
from

the

could
not

but
he
flapped
his

violently
thereby

balser
hurried
to
the
house
for
his
gun
and
with
tom
fox
quickly
paddled
across
the
river
in
pursuit
of
the
wolf
the
boys
entered
the
forest
at
the
place
the
wolf
had
chosen
white
feathers
from
the
gander
furnished
a
distinct
spoor
and
balser
had
no
difficulty
in
keeping
on
the
wolf
s
track
the
boys
had
been
walking
rapidly
for
thirty
or
forty
minutes
when
they
found
that
the
tracks
left
by
the
wolf
and
the
scattered
feathers
of
the
gander
led
toward
a
thick
clump
of
pawpaw
bushes
and
vines
which
grew
at
the
foot
of
a
small
rocky
hill
into
this
thicket
the
boys
cautiously
worked
their
way
and
after
careful
examination
they
found
ingeniously
concealed
by
dense
foliage
a
small
hole
or
cleft
in
the
rocks
at
the
base
of
the
hill
and
they
at
once
knew
that
the
wolf
had
gone
to
earth
and
that
this
was
his
den
foxes
make
for
themselves
and
their
families
the
snuggest
most
ingenious
home
in
the
ground
you
can
possibly
imagine
they
seek
a
place
at
the
base
of
a
hill
or
bluff
and
dig
what
we
would
call
in
our
houses
a
narrow
hallway
straight
into
the
hill
they
loosen
the
dirt
with
their
front
feet
and
throw
it
back
of
them
then
with
their
hind
feet
they
keep
pushing
it
farther
toward
the
opening
of
the
hole
until
they
have
cast
it
all
out
when
they
have
removed
the
loose
dirt
they
at
once
scatter
it
over
the
ground
and
carefully
cover
it
with
leaves
and
vines
to
avoid
attracting
unwelcome
visitors
to
their
home
when
the
hallway
is
finished
the
fox
digs
upward
into
the
hill
and
there
he
makes
his
real
home
his
reason
for
doing
this
is
to
prevent
water
from
flowing
through
his
hall
into
his
living
apartment
the
latter
is
often
quite
a
cave
in
the
earth
and
furnishes
as
roomy
and
cozy
a
home
for
and
fox
and
their
children
as
you
could
find
in
the
world
it
is
cool
in
summer
and
warm
in
winter
it
is
softly
carpeted
with
leaves
grass
and
feathers
and
the
foxes
lie
there
snugly
enough
when
the
winter
comes
on
with
its
freezing
and
snowing
and
blowing
when
the
fox
gets
hungry
he
slips
out
of
his
cozy
home
and
briskly
trots
to
some
chicken
roost
or
perhaps
he
finds
a
covey
of
quails
huddled
under
a
bunch
of
straw
in
either
case
he
carries
home
with
him
a
dainty
dinner
and
after
he
has
feasted
he
cares
not
how
the
wind
blows
nor
how
the
river
freezes
nor
how
the
snow
falls
for
he
is
housed
like
a
king
and
is
as
warm
and
comfortable
and
happy
as
if
he
owned
the
earth
and
lived
in
a
palace
wolves
also
make
their
dens
in
the
earth
but
they
usually
hunt
for
a
place
where
the
hallway
at
least
is
already
made
for
them
they
seek
a
hill
with
a
rocky
base
and
find
a
cave
partially
made
the
entrance
to
which
is
a
small
opening
between
the
rocks
with
this
for
a
commencement
they
dig
out
the
interior
and
make
their
home
somewhat
upon
the
plan
of
the
fox
the
old
wolf
which
balser
and
tom
had
chased
to
earth
had
found
a
fine
dinner
for
his
youngsters
and
while
the
boys
were
watching
the
hole
no
doubt
the
wolf
family
was
having
a
glorious
feast
upon
the
gander
the
boys
of
course
were
at
their
rope
s
end
the
dogs
were
not
with
them
and
even
had
they
been
they
were
too
large
to
enter
the
hole
leading
to
the
wolf
s
den
so
the
boys
seated
themselves
upon
a
rock
a
short
distance
from
the
opening
and
after
a
little
time
adopted
the
following
plan
of
action
balser
was
to
lie
upon
his
breast
on
the
hillside
a
few
yards
above
the
opening
of
the
wolf
den
while
tom
was
to
conceal
himself
in
the
dense
foliage
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
they
took
their
positions
accordingly
both
were
entirely
hidden
by
vines
and
bushes
and
remained
silent
as
the
tomb
they
had
agreed
that
they
should
lie
entirely
motionless
until
the
shadow
of
a
certain
tree
should
fall
across
tom
s
face
which
they
thought
would
occur
within
an
hour
then
tom
who
could
mimic
the
calls
and
cries
of
many
birds
and
beasts
was
to
squawk
like
a
goose
and
tempt
the
wolf
from
his
den
so
that
balser
could
shoot
him
it
was
a
harder
task
than
you
may
imagine
to
lie
on
the
ground
amid
the
bushes
and
leaves
for
it
seemed
at
least
so
tom
said
that
all
the
ants
and
bugs
and
worms
in
the
woods
had
met
at
that
particular
place
and
at
that
exact
time
for
the
sole
purpose
of
drilling
up
and
down
and
over
and
around
his
body
and
to
bite
him
at
every
step
he
dared
not
move
to
frighten
away
the
torments
nor
to
scratch
he
could
not
even
grumble
which
to
tom
was
the
sorest
trial
of
all
illustration
bang
went
balser
s
gun
and
the
wolf
paid
for
his
feast
with
his
the
moment
the
shadow
of
the
tree
fell
upon
his
face
tom
squawked
like
a
goose
so
naturally
that
balser
could
hardly
believe
it
was
tom
and
not
a
real
goose
soon
he
uttered
another
squawk
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
wolf
came
out
of
his
hall
door
doubtless
thinking
to
himself
that
that
was
his
lucky
day
for
he
would
have
two
ganders
one
for
dinner
and
one
for
supper
and
plenty
of
cold
goose
for
breakfast
and
dinner
the
next
day
but
he
was
mistaken
for
it
was
the
unluckiest
day
of
the
poor
wolf
s
life
bang
went
balser
s
gun
and
the
wolf
who
had
simply
done
his
duty
as
a
father
by
providing
a
dinner
for
his
family
paid
for
his
feast
with
his
life
we
ll
drag
the
body
a
short
distance
away
from
the
den
said
balser
and
you
lie
down
again
and
this
time
whine
like
a
wolf
then
the
old
will
come
out
and
we
ll
get
her
tom
objected
i
wouldn
t
lie
there
another
hour
and
let
them
ants
and
bugs
chaw
over
me
as
they
did
for
all
the
wolves
in
the
but
just
think
tom
answered
balser
when
the
wagons
go
to
brookville
this
fall
we
can
get
a
shilling
apiece
for
the
wolfskins
think
of
it
a
shilling
one
for
you
and
one
for
me
i
ll
furnish
the
powder
and
shot
if
you
ll
squawk
and
whine
squawks
and
whines
don
t
cost
anything
but
powder
and
lead
does
now
that
s
a
good
fellow
just
lie
down
and
whine
a
little
she
ll
come
out
pretty
tom
still
refused
and
balser
still
insisted
soon
balser
grew
angry
and
called
tom
a
fool
tom
answered
in
kind
and
in
a
moment
the
boys
clinched
for
a
fight
they
scuffled
and
fought
awhile
and
soon
stumbled
over
the
dead
wolf
and
fell
to
the
ground
balser
was
lucky
enough
to
fall
on
top
and
proceeded
to
pound
tom
at
a
great
rate
now
will
you
whine
demanded
balser
no
answered
tom
then
take
that
and
that
and
that
now
will
you
whine
no
cried
tom
determined
not
to
yield
so
balser
went
at
it
again
but
there
was
no
give
up
to
stubborn
tom
even
if
he
was
on
the
under
side
at
last
balser
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
and
sitting
astride
of
his
stubborn
foe
said
tom
if
you
ll
whine
i
ll
lend
you
my
gun
for
a
whole
and
powder
and
bullets
asked
tom
well
i
guess
not
answered
balser
i
ll
lick
you
twenty
times
if
you
ll
lend
me
your
gun
and
give
me
ten
full
loads
i
ll
whine
till
i
fetch
every
wolf
in
the
woods
if
the
bugs
do
eat
me
that
s
a
go
said
balser
glad
enough
to
compromise
with
a
boy
who
didn
t
know
when
he
was
whipped
then
they
got
up
and
were
as
good
friends
as
if
no
trouble
had
occurred
between
them
balser
at
once
lay
down
upon
the
hillside
above
the
wolf
den
and
tom
took
his
place
to
whine
the
boys
understood
their
job
thoroughly
and
tom
s
whines
soon
brought
out
the
old
she
looked
cautiously
about
her
for
a
moment
stole
softly
over
to
her
dead
mate
and
dropped
by
his
side
with
a
bullet
through
her
heart
tom
was
about
to
rise
but
balser
said
whine
again
whine
again
and
the
young
ones
will
come
tom
whined
and
sure
enough
out
came
two
scrawny
wolf
whelps
the
boys
rushed
upon
them
and
caught
them
by
the
back
of
the
neck
to
avoid
being
bitten
for
the
little
teeth
of
the
pups
were
as
sharp
as
needles
and
could
inflict
an
ugly
wound
balser
handed
the
whelp
he
had
caught
to
tom
and
proceeded
to
cut
two
forked
sticks
from
a
tough
bush
which
the
children
called
indian
these
forked
branches
the
boys
tied
about
the
necks
of
the
pups
with
which
to
lead
them
home
illustration
caught
them
by
the
back
of
the
tom
then
cut
a
strong
limb
from
a
tree
with
his
this
was
quite
an
undertaking
but
in
time
he
cut
it
through
and
trimmed
off
the
smaller
branches
the
boys
tied
together
the
legs
of
the
old
wolves
and
swung
them
over
the
pole
which
they
took
upon
their
shoulders
and
started
home
leading
the
pups
they
arrived
home
an
hour
or
two
before
sunset
and
found
that
liney
and
sukey
had
arranged
supper
under
the
elms
the
boys
scoured
their
faces
and
hands
with
soft
soap
for
that
was
the
only
soap
they
had
and
sat
down
to
supper
with
cheeks
shining
and
hair
pasted
to
their
heads
slick
and
tight
when
a
fellow
gets
washed
up
this
way
and
has
his
hair
combed
so
slick
it
makes
him
feel
like
it
was
sunday
said
tom
who
was
uneasily
clean
tom
i
wouldn
t
let
people
know
how
seldom
i
washed
my
face
if
i
were
you
said
liney
with
a
slight
blush
they
ll
think
you
clean
up
only
on
tom
however
did
not
allow
liney
s
remarks
to
interrupt
his
supper
but
continued
to
make
sad
havoc
among
the
good
things
on
the
log
there
was
white
bread
made
from
wheat
flour
so
snowy
and
light
that
it
beat
cake
all
holler
the
boys
wheat
bread
was
a
luxury
to
the
settler
folks
in
those
days
for
the
mill
nearest
to
the
blue
river
settlement
was
over
on
whitewater
at
brookville
fifty
miles
away
wheat
and
the
skins
of
wild
animals
were
the
only
products
that
the
farmers
could
easily
turn
into
cash
so
the
small
crops
were
too
precious
to
be

daily
and

was
used
only
for
special
occasions
such
as
christmas
or
new
year

or
company
dinner
usually
three
or
four
of
the
farmers
joined
in
a
little
caravan
and
went
in
their
wagons
to
brookville
twice
a
year
they
would
go
in
the
spring
with
the
hides
of
animals
killed
during
the
winter
that
being
the
hunting
season
and
the
hides
then
taken
being
of
superior
quality
to
those
taken
at
any
other
time
illustration
the
boys
tied
together
the
legs
of
the
old
wolves
and
swung
them
over
the
pole
and
started
home
leading
the
early
in
the
fall
they
would
go
again
to
brookville
to
market
their
summer
crop
of
wheat
fox
and
a
few
neighbours
had
returned
from
an
early
trip
to
market
only
a
day
or
two
before
the
children
s
party
at
balser
s
home
and
had
brought
with
them
a
few
packages
of
a
fine
new
drink
called
coffee
that
is
it
was
new
to
the
western
settler
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
milk
sweetened
with
tree
sugar
being
the
usual
table
drink
liney
had
brought
over
a
small
gourdful
of
coffee
as
a
present
to
brent
and
a
pot
of
the
brown
beverage
had
been
prepared
for
the
supper
under
the
elms
the
yates
children
and
tom
were
frank
enough
to
admit
that
the
coffee
was
bitter
and
not
fit
to
drink
but
liney
had
made
it
and
balser
drank
it
declaring
it
was
very
good
indeed
liney
knew
he
told
a
story
but
she
thanked
him
for
it
nevertheless
and
said
that
the
yates
children
and
tom
were
so
thoroughly
country
and
green
that
she
couldn
t
expect
them
to
like
a
civilized
drink
this
would
have
made
trouble
with
tom
but
balser
who
saw
it
coming
said
now
you
shut
up
tom
and
balser
had
so
recently
whipped
tom
that
his
word
bore
the
weight
of
authority
besides
the
coffee
and
the
white
bread
there
was
a
great
gourd
full
of
milk
with
the
cream
mixed
in
just
from
the
springhouse
delicious
and
cold
there
was
a
cold
loin
of
venison
which
had
been
spitted
and
roasted
over
a
bed
of
hot
coals
in
the
kitchen
fireplace
that
morning
there
was
a
gourd
full
of
quail
eggs
which
had
been
boiled
hard
and
then
cooled
in
the
springhouse
there
were
heaping
plates
of
fried
chicken
and
rolls
of
glorious
yellow
butter
just
from
the
churn
rich
with
the
genuine
butter
taste
that
makes
one
long
to
eat
it
by
the
spoonful
then
there
was
a
delicious
apple
pie
sweet
and
crusty
floating
in
cream
almost
as
thick
as
molasses
in
winter
they
were
backwoods
homely
children
but
the
supper
to
which
they
sat
down
under
the
elms
was
fit
for
a
king
and
the
appetite
with
which
they
ate
it
was
too
good
for
any
king
during
the
supper
the
bear
cubs
had
been
nosing
about
the
log
table
begging
each
one
by
turns
for
a
bite
to
eat
they
were
so
troublesome
that
jim
got
a
long
stick
and
whenever
they
came
within
reach
he
gave
them
a
sharp
rap
upon
the
head
and
soon
they
waddled
away
in
a
pet
of
indignant
disgust
for
quite
a
while
after
jim
had
driven
them
off
there
had
been
a
season
of
suspicious
quietude
on
the
part
of
the
cubs
suddenly
a
chorus
of
yelps
howls
growls
and
whines
came
from
the
direction
of
the
wolf
pups
the
attention
of
all
at
the
table
was
of
course
at
once
attracted
by
the
noise
and
those
who
looked
beheld
probably
the
most
comical
battle
ever
fought
tom
and
jerry
with
their
everlasting
desire
to
have
their
noses
into
everything
that
did
not
concern
them
had
gone
to
investigate
the
wolf
pups
and
in
the
course
of
the
investigation
a
fight
ensued
whereby
the
wolves
were
liberated
the
cubs
were
the
stronger
but
the
wolves
were
more
active
thus
the
battle
was
quite
even
the
bears
being
awkward
of
course
were
in
each
other
s
way
most
of
the
time
and
would
fall
over
themselves
and
roll
upon
the
ground
for
a
second
or
two
before
they
could
again
get
upon
their
clumsy
feet
the
consequence
was
that
the
wolves
soon
had
the
best
of
the
fight
and
being
once
free
from
the
cubs
scampered
off
to
the
woods
and
were
never
seen
again
when
the
wolves
had
gone
the
cubs
turned
round
and
round
looking
for
their
late
antagonists
but
failing
to
find
them
sat
down
upon
their
haunches
grinned
at
each
other
in
a
very
silly
manner
and
then
began
to
growl
and
grumble
in
the
worst
bear
language
any
one
had
ever
heard
balser
scolded
the
cubs
roundly
and
told
them
he
had
taught
them
better
than
to
swear
even
in
bear
talk
he
then
switched
them
for
having
liberated
the
wolves
and
went
back
to
supper
the
switching
quieted
the
bears
for
a
short
time
but
soon
their
spirit
of
mischief
again
asserted
itself
after
another
period
of
suspicious
silence
on
the
part
of
the
cubs
jim
put
a
general
inquiry
to
the
company
what
do
you
s
pose
they
re
up
to
this
time
goodness
only
knows
responded
balser
but
if
i
hear
another
grunt
out
of
them
i
ll
take
a
stick
to
them
that
ll
hurt
and
off
they
ll
go
to
their
pen
for
the
the
settlers
frequently
caught
swarms
of
bees
in
the
woods
and
balser
s
father
had
several
hives
near
the
house
these
hives
were
called
gums
because
they
were
made
from
sections
of
a
hollow
gum
tree
that
being
the
best
wood
for
the
home
of
the
bees
these
hollow
gums
were
placed
on
end
upon
small
slanting
platforms
and
were
covered
with
clapboards
which
were
held
tightly
in
their
places
by
heavy
stones
there
was
a
small
hole
perhaps
as
large
as
the
end
of
your
finger
cut
in
the
wood
at
the
base
through
which
the
bees
entered
and
upon
the
inside
of
the
hive
they
constructed
their
comb
and
stored
their
honey
i
told
you
once
before
how
bears
delight
to
eat
fish
and
blackberries
they
are
also
very
fond
of
honey
in
fact
bears
seem
to
have
a
general
appetite
and
enjoy
everything
from
boys
to
blackberries
hardly
had
balser
spoken
his
threat
when
another
duet
of
howls
and
yelps
reached
his
ears
now
what
on
earth
is
it
he
asked
and
immediately
started
around
the
house
in
the
direction
whence
the
howls
had
come
geminy
i
believe
they
ve
upset
the
said
jim
don
t
you
know
they
have
asked
balser
by
that
time
the
boys
were
in
sight
of
the
bears
illustration
these
hives
were
called
well
i
know
now
they
have
if
that
suits
you
any
better
golly
look
at
them
paw
and
scratch
and
rub
their
eyes
when
the
bees
sting
good
enough
for
you
give
it
to
em
bees
and
jim
threw
back
his
head
and
almost
split
his
sides
with
laughter
sure
enough
the
bears
had
got
to
nosing
about
the
and
in
their
ever
hungry
greediness
had
upset
one
this
of
course
made
the
bees
very
angry
and
they
attacked
the
cubs
in
a
buzzing
stinging
swarm
that
set
them
yelping
growling
and
snapping
in
a
most
desperate
and
comical
manner
all
their
snapping
and
growling
however
did
no
good
for
the
bees
continued
to
buzz
and
sting
without
any
indication
of
being
merciful
a
little
of
this
sort
of
thing
went
a
long
way
with
the
black
and
they
soon
ran
to
balser
and
jim
for
help
the
bees
of
course
followed
and
when
the
boys
and
girls
saw
the
bees
coming
toward
them
they
broke
in
all
directions
and
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
go
the
bears
then
ran
to
the
river
and
plunged
in
to
escape
their
tormentors
when
the
gum
had
been
placed
in
position
again
and
the
bees
had
become
quiet
the
cubs
thinking
the
field
clear
came
out
of
the
water
dripping
wet
then
they
waddled
up
close
to
the
girls
and
out
of
pure
mischief
shook
themselves
and
sprinkled
the
dainty
clean
frocks
with
a
shower
from
their
frowzy
hides
that
sealed
the
fate
of
the
cubs
for
the
day
and
when
balser
marched
them
off
to
their
pen
they
looked
so
meek
and
innocent
that
one
would
have
thought
that
they
had
been
attending
bear
all
their
lives
and
were
entirely
lacking
in
all
unwarrantable
and
facetious
instincts
they
went
to
bed
supperless
that
evening
but
had
their
revenge
for
their
yelps
and
whines
kept
the
whole
family
awake
most
of
the
night
by
the
time
the
bears
had
been
put
to
bed
darkness
was
near
at
hand
so
the
supper
dishes
and
gourds
were
washed
and
carried
to
the
kitchen
then
the
visitors
said
good
night
and
left
for
home
illustration
chapter
vi
borrowed
fire
one
day
tom
fox
was
told
by
his
mother
to
kindle
the
fire
which
had
been
allowed
to
grow
so
dim
that
only
a
smouldering
bed
of
embers
was
left
upon
the
hearth
hanging
from
the
crane
was
a
large
kettle
almost
full
of
water
now
in
addition
to
his
reputation
for
freckles
tom
was
also
believed
to
be
the
awkwardest
boy
in
the
blue
river
settlement
upon
the
day
above
referred
to
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
live
up
to
his
reputation
by
upsetting
the
kettle
of
water
upon
the
fire
thereby
extinguishing
the
last
spark
of
that
necessary
element
in
the
fox
household
of
course
there
was
not
a
lucifer
match
on
all
blue
river
from
its
source
to
its
mouth
and
as
fox
had
taken
the
with
him
on
a
hunting
expedition
and
would
not
return
till
night
limpy
received
a
sound
thrashing
and
was
sent
to
the
house
loft
there
to
ponder
for
the
rest
of
the
day
over
his
misdeeds
fox
then
sent
liney
over
to
brent
s
to
borrow
fire
limpy
would
have
been
glad
to
go
had
his
mother
seen
fit
to
send
him
but
the
task
would
have
been
a
reward
rather
than
a
punishment
liney
was
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
to
visit
the
brent
cabin
so
away
she
went
very
willingly
indeed
before
the
day
was
finished
she
was
doubly
glad
she
had
gone
and
the
help
she
was
able
to
give
to
a
friend
in
need
made
her
devoutly
thankful
to
the
kind
fate
which
operating
through
fox
had
sent
her
on
her
errand
the
terrible
adventure
which
befell
her
and
the
i
am
telling
my
story
before
i
come
to
it
when
balser
was
a
boy
each
season
brought
its
separate
work
and
recreation
on
the
farm
as
it
does
now
but
especially
was
this
true
in
the
time
of
the
early
settlers
the
winter
was
the
hunting
season
the
occupation
of
hunting
which
was
looked
upon
as
sport
and
recreation
combined
was
also
a
business
with
the
men
who
cleared
the
land
and
felled
the
forests
of
indiana
for
a
of
good
pelts
taken
during
the
winter
season
when
the
fur
is
at
its
best
was
no
inconsiderable
matter
and
brought
at
market
more
money
than
the
same
wagon
filled
with
wheat
would
have
been
worth
so
the
settler
of
balser
s
time
worked
quite
as
hard
in
the
winter
with
his
rifle
as
he
did
with
his
hoe
and
plough
in
the
fields
during
the
months
of
summer
spring
of
course
was
the
time
for
breaking
up
and
ploughing
summer
was
the
wheat
harvest
then
also
the
various
kinds
of
wild
berries
were
gathered
and
dried
or
preserved
in
the
summer
casks
of
rich
blackberry
wine
were
made
to
warm
the
cold
hunter
upon
his
return
from
the
chase
during
the
cold
days
to
come
or
to
regale
company
upon
long
winter
evenings
before
the
blazing
fire
blackberries
could
be
had
by
the
bushel
for
the
mere
gathering
and
the
wine
could
be
made
so
cheaply
that
almost
every
house
was
well
stocked
with
the
delicious
beverage
then
came
the
corn
gathering
and
bringing
in
the
fodder
the
latter
was
brought
in
by
and
was
stacked
against
the
sides
of
the
barn
and
of
the
cow
shed
it
answered
a
double
purpose
it
made
the
barn
and
sheds
warm
and
cozy
homes
for
the
stock
during
the
cold
bleak
winter
and
furnished
food
for
the
cattle
and
the
horses
so
that
by
spring
they
had
eaten
part
of
their
houses
the
wheat
straw
was
stacked
in
the
barnyard
and
into
this
the
sheep
and
calves
burrowed
little
caves
wherein
they
would
lie
so
snug
and
warm
that
it
made
no
difference
to
them
how
much
the
wind
blew
or
the
snow
and
rain
fell
or
how
hard
it
froze
outside
for
the
bad
weather
made
their
cozy
shelter
seem
all
the
more
comfortable
by
contrast
the
fall
also
had
its
duties
part
task
and
part
play
the
woods
abounded
in
hickory
nuts
walnuts
and
hazelnuts
and
a
supply
of
all
these
had
to
be
gathered
for
they
furnished
no
small
part
of
the
winter
food
preparation
was
always
made
for
this
work
by
the
boys
of
brent
s
family
long
before
a
hickory
nut
had
thought
of
falling
shortly
after
the
wolf
hunt
which
i
described
to
you
in
the
last
chapter
balser
and
jim
began
to
make
ready
for
the
nut
campaign
their
first
task
was
to
build
a
small
wagon
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
home
the
nuts
they
found
a
tree
twelve
or
fourteen
inches
in
diameter
which
they
felled
they
then
sawed
off
four
round
sections
of
the
tree
each
about
one
inch
thick
to
serve
as
wheels
from
the
outer
edge
of
these
wheels
they
removed
the
bark
and
bound
them
with
tires
made
from
the
iron
hoops
of
a
barrel
they
then
cut
round
holes
in
the
centre
in
which
to
insert
the
axles
of
the
wagon
with
their
hatchets
they
split
clapboards
which
they
made
smooth
and
of
the
clapboards
they
made
the
bottom
sides
and
ends
the
boys
worked
pretty
hard
for
ten
or
twelve
days
and
completed
as
perfect
a
wagon
in
miniature
as
any
one
ever
beheld
there
were
the
tongue
the
axletree
the
sideboard
the
headboard
and
the
and
floor
all
fitted
so
tightly
together
that
you
would
have
declared
a
wagon
maker
had
made
them
the
wheels
bound
with
tires
were
marvels
of
their
kind
the
wagon
bed
would
hold
as
much
as
could
be
contained
in
two
large
flour
sacks
and
when
filled
with
nuts
would
prove
quite
a
load
to
draw
consequently
the
boys
must
have
a
team
of
some
sort
the
team
which
they
eventually
rigged
up
was
probably
the
most
absurd
and
curious
combination
that
ever
drew
a
load
the
boys
selected
strong
pieces
of
and
made
four
sets
of
harness
for
what
purpose
do
you
suppose
you
never
could
guess
two
for
the
dogs
tige
and
prince
and
two
for
the
bear
cubs
tom
and
jerry
who
they
proposed
should
do
something
to
earn
their
bread
and
milk
for
they
were
growing
to
be
great
awkward
fellows
and
were
very
strong
so
the
four
sets
of
harness
were
finished
and
one
day
the
odd
team
was
hitched
up
for
trial
the
little
wagon
was
loaded
with
rocks
and
the
boys
tried
to
start
the
team
the
dogs
seemed
willing
enough
to
obey
but
the
cubs
which
were
hitched
in
front
went
every
way
but
the
right
one
and
showed
a
disposition
to
rebel
against
the
indignity
of
work
the
bears
were
then
taken
from
the
lead
the
dogs
were
put
in
their
places
and
the
bears
were
put
next
to
the
wagon
the
team
was
started
again
but
the
cubs
lay
down
flat
upon
the
ground
and
refused
to
move
after
trying
in
vain
to
induce
the
cubs
to
do
their
duty
balser
spoke
to
jim
who
was
standing
at
the
dogs
heads
and
jim
started
forward
leading
the
dogs
and
jim
and
the
dogs
dragged
after
them
the
cubs
and
the
wagon
at
almost
every
step
the
heavily
loaded
wagon
would
roll
upon
the
hind
feet
of
the
cubs
and
balser
threw
thorns
upon
the
ground
which
pricked
the
bears
as
they
were
dragged
along
until
the
black
sluggards
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
easier
to
work
than
to
be
dragged
over
thorns
so
they
arose
to
their
feet
and
followed
the
dogs
without
however
drawing
an
ounce
of
the
load
illustration
the
cubs
went
every
way
but
the
right
way
the
boys
kept
patiently
at
this
sort
of
training
for
three
weeks
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
between
bribes
in
the
way
of
milk
and
honey
and
beatings
with
a
thick
stick
the
cubs
little
by
little
submitted
to
their
task
and
eventually
proved
to
be
real
little
oxen
at
drawing
a
load
the
dogs
of
course
had
been
broken
in
easily
by
the
time
the
cubs
were
ready
for
work
the
hickory
nuts
walnuts
and
hazelnuts
were
ready
to
be
gathered
and
the
boys
only
waited
for
a
heavy
black
frost
to
loosen
the
nuts
from
their
shells
and
a
strong
wind
to
shake
them
from
the
branches
during
the
summer
of
which
i
told
you
in
the
preceding
chapters
brent
had
raised
the
roof
of
his
house
so
as
to
make
a
room
in
the
loft
for
the
boys
this
room
was
floored
with
rough
boards
between
which
large
cracks
were
left
so
that
heat
from
the
room
below
might
arise
and
warm
the
boys
room
the
upper
room
was
reached
by
the
most
primitive
of
stairways
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
small
log
or
thick
pole
with
notches
cut
on
each
side
for
footholds
or
steps
in
going
up
this
stairway
the
boys
climbed
hand
over
hand
and
foot
over
foot
as
a
bear
climbs
a
tree
and
to
come
down
without
falling
was
a
task
of
no
small
proportions
to
one
inexperienced
in
the
art
one
morning
jim
awakened
and
looked
out
from
under
the
warm
bearskin
which
served
for
a
blanket
comforter
and
sheet
he
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
wind
which
was
blowing
a
gale
and
then
awakened
balser
balser
balser
said
jim
wake
up
there
s
frost
enough
to
freeze
a
brass
monkey
and
the
wind
is
blowing
hard
enough
to
blow
down
the
trees
to
say
nothing
of
the
nuts
let
s
get
up
and
have
an
early
balser
was
willing
and
soon
the
boys
had
climbed
out
from
under
the
warm
bearskin
and
were
downstairs
preparing
to
kindle
the
fires
the
was
no
hard
task
for
the
backlog
which
had
been
put
in
the
fireplace
the
evening
before
was
a
great
roll
of
red
coals
and
all
that
the
boys
had
to
do
to
kindle
the
fire
was
to
poke
the
backlog
and
it
fell
in
chunks
of
burning
hickory
that
hissed
and
popped
and
flamed
and
made
the
room
warm
before
you
could
say
jack
then
the
boys
threw
on
a
large
armful
of
cut
wood
and
soon
the
blaze
was
crackling
cozily
and
the
kettle
singing
merrily
on
the
flames
the
morning
was
cold
and
the
boys
sat
upon
the
great
hearth
with
their
palms
to
the
fire
getting
good
and
warm
for
the
day
while
the
gray
frosty
dawn
was
slowly
frightening
the
shadows
of
night
away
from
the
forest
to
which
they
seemed
to
cling
then
came
the
mother
who
made
the
breakfast
of
sweet
fried
venison
floating
in
maple
syrup
and
butter
and
eggs
instead
of
coffee
they
drank
warm
milk
sweetened
with
maple
sugar
and
i
can
tell
you
it
was
a
breakfast
to
wax
fat
on
the
sun
was
hardly
above
the
horizon
when
breakfast
was
finished
and
the
dogs
and
cubs
were
fed
then
they
were
harnessed
to
the
wagon
and
boys
bears
dogs
and
wagon
all
started
on
their
way
to
the
woods
hickory
trees
did
not
grow
plentifully
in
the
so
the
boys
made
for
the
hills
perhaps
a
mile
away
shortly
after
they
had
reached
the
hills
jim
cried
out
oh
here
s
a
great
big
shellbark
i
ll
bet
the
ground
s
covered
with
sure
enough
the
ground
was
covered
with
them
and
the
boys
filled
their
wagon
in
a
very
short
time
then
they
started
home
the
trip
home
was
marred
by
an
upset
owing
to
the
perversity
of
the
cubs
but
the
boys
righted
the
wagon
loaded
it
with
nuts
again
and
after
considerable
trouble
deposited
them
safely
at
home
and
went
back
for
another
load
the
team
worked
admirably
barring
a
general
tendency
to
run
over
logs
and
stones
and
two
great
loads
of
hickory
nuts
were
safely
brought
to
the
house
before
dinner
after
the
boys
bears
and
dogs
had
eaten
a
hurried
meal
they
again
went
forth
in
quest
of
nuts
but
they
took
a
different
course
this
time
toward
the
is
in
the
direction
of
the
house
of
the
purpose
of
visiting
a
hazel
thicket
which
was
a
mile
from
home
soon
the
hazel
patch
was
reached
and
about
five
o
clock
the
wagon
was
full
of
beautiful
brown
little
nuts
than
which
there
is
none
sweeter
when
the
wagon
was
loaded
the
boys
hitched
up
the
team
much
to
the
delight
of
the
latter
for
by
that
time
the
dogs
and
cubs
had
come
to
think
it
great
sport
and
the
caravan
moved
homeward
soon
after
leaving
the
hazel
patch
the
boys
entered
a
dark
strip
of
woods
and
undergrowth
through
which
it
was
very
hard
work
to
draw
the
wagon
so
they
attached
a
long
piece
of
tanned
deerskin
to
the
tongue
of
the
wagon
and
gave
the
team
a
helping
hand
there
was
but
one
path
through
this
dark
strip
of
forest
over
which
the
wagon
could
be
drawn
and
it
led
through
a
low
piece
of
ground
that
was
wet
and
marshy
upon
the
soft
earth
of
the
path
balser
soon
noticed
the
long
broad
tracks
of
a
bear
and
the
dogs
at
once
began
to
bark
and
plunge
in
their
harness
the
tracks
appeared
to
balser
to
be
an
hour
old
so
he
quieted
the
dogs
but
did
not
release
them
from
the
wagon
as
he
should
have
done
the
boys
went
forward
regardless
of
the
warning
bear
tracks
and
the
dogs
and
bears
drawing
the
wagon
followed
closely
at
their
heels
as
they
proceeded
the
bear
tracks
became
fresher
and
balser
began
to
grow
somewhat
fearful
jim
had
become
frightened
and
had
taken
a
position
at
the
rear
of
the
wagon
to
give
a
helping
hand
by
pushing
at
the
load
he
said
he
could
push
better
than
he
could
pull
anyway
after
the
little
party
had
got
well
into
the
darkest
part
of
the
forest
the
dogs
began
to
show
such
evident
signs
of
uneasiness
that
balser
grasped
his
gun
and
held
it
in
readiness
prepared
for
a
fight
should
one
become
necessary
the
ground
had
been
frozen
earlier
in
the
day
but
it
had
thawed
and
the
path
was
slippery
balser
who
was
walking
a
short
distance
ahead
of
the
train
as
a
sort
of
advance
guard
suddenly
stopped
and
held
up
his
hand
warningly
to
jim
for
right
ahead
of
him
in
the
path
stood
a
huge
bear
with
its
head
turned
backward
looking
inquiringly
in
the
direction
of
the
boys
jim
at
once
stopped
the
team
the
dogs
of
course
were
dancing
with
impatience
to
be
released
from
the
harness
and
even
the
bears
seemed
to
realize
that
something
was
wrong
it
s
running
away
said
balser
it
s
not
safe
to
shoot
at
it
from
behind
i
might
wound
it
and
then
we
should
be
the
ones
to
run
what
shall
we
do
let
it
run
answered
jim
quickly
i
don
t
like
to
run
with
a
bear
after
me
anyway
if
you
re
going
to
shoot
i
ll
run
now
so
as
to
get
a
good
no
you
don
t
you
stand
right
where
you
are
and
take
care
of
the
team
if
you
move
a
foot
i
ll
lick
you
answered
balser
as
he
moved
cautiously
ahead
in
the
direction
of
the
retreating
bear
jim
was
frozen
by
fear
to
the
spot
upon
which
he
stood
as
balser
walked
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
he
again
heard
balser
speak
and
then
he
heard
a
loud
deep
growl
the
dogs
barked
and
plunged
the
cubs
whined
and
gave
forth
savage
little
growls
half
whines
for
they
were
only
learning
to
growl
jim
began
to
weep
and
to
scream
balser
who
had
disappeared
from
sight
around
a
curve
in
the
path
cried
out
let
the
dogs
loose
for
goodness
sake
jim
it
s
after
the
dogs
seemed
to
understand
balser
s
cry
better
than
jim
did
for
they
barked
and
plunged
more
violently
than
ever
in
their
harness
jim
seemed
dazed
and
could
not
or
at
least
did
not
unharness
the
dogs
then
it
was
that
the
good
dog
sense
of
old
prince
showed
itself
instead
of
waiting
for
help
from
jim
who
he
saw
had
lost
his
wits
the
good
dog
began
to
gnaw
at
the
leather
harness
which
held
him
and
tige
to
the
wagon
and
in
a
short
time
the
dogs
were
freed
from
the
wagon
though
still
tied
to
each
other
tige
caught
inspiration
from
prince
and
the
dogs
backed
away
from
each
other
and
pulled
with
all
their
strength
until
the
harness
slipped
over
the
head
of
prince
and
left
the
dogs
free
then
prince
plunged
rapidly
into
the
thicket
to
the
rescue
of
his
master
followed
closely
by
tige
dragging
the
broken
harness
help
help
cried
balser
why
don
t
you
send
the
dogs
and
his
voice
seemed
to
be
going
farther
and
farther
away
where
are
you
cried
jim
in
despair
his
terror
was
so
strong
upon
him
that
he
could
not
move
and
could
not
have
helped
balser
had
he
been
able
to
go
to
him
jim
was
a
little
fellow
you
must
remember
help
help
cried
balser
again
his
voice
sounding
from
a
still
greater
distance
i
ve
wounded
it
and
it
s
about
to
kill
me
help
help
but
the
cries
came
fainter
and
fainter
jim
stood
his
ground
and
screamed
manfully
soon
after
balser
had
left
jim
and
the
wagon
the
bear
turned
toward
its
pursuer
and
presented
to
balser
its
broadside
this
gave
the
boy
a
good
chance
for
a
shot
for
the
moment
balser
forgot
his
father
s
admonition
to
be
deliberate
and
to
act
slowly
and
his
forgetfulness
almost
cost
him
his
life
balser
shot
and
wounded
the
bear
in
the
neck
but
did
not
kill
it
then
it
turned
and
balser
fearing
to
run
back
upon
the
path
lest
he
should
bring
the
bear
upon
jim
started
into
the
thicket
toward
the
river
with
the
bear
in
hot
pursuit
balser
gained
rapidly
upon
the
bear
at
first
but
he
knew
that
his
advantage
could
not
last
for
the
bear
was
sure
to
catch
him
soon
what
should
he
do
he
hastily
went
over
in
his
mind
the
possibilities
in
the
case
and
soon
determined
to
put
forth
his
utmost
speed
to
gain
as
much
upon
the
bear
as
possible
and
then
to
climb
the
first
tree
of
the
proper
size
to
which
he
should
come
with
this
intent
he
flung
his
carbine
over
his
back
by
a
strap
attached
to
the
gun
for
that
purpose
and
ran
for
dear
life
soon
the
boy
reached
a
small
beech
tree
the
branches
of
which
were
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
up
this
tree
he
climbed
with
the
agility
of
a
squirrel
he
afterward
said
i
was
so
badly
scared
that
it
seemed
as
if
my
hands
and
feet
had
claws
like
a
the
bear
had
followed
so
closely
upon
his
track
that
just
as
the
boy
was
about
to
draw
himself
up
among
the
branches
of
the
tree
the
bear
rose
upon
its
hind
legs
and
caught
the
boy
s
toes
between
his
teeth
balser
screamed
with
pain
and
tried
to
draw
his
foot
away
but
the
harder
he
pulled
the
harder
pulled
the
bear
and
the
pain
was
so
great
that
he
thought
he
could
not
stand
it
while
he
clung
to
the
limb
with
one
hand
he
reached
toward
the
bear
with
the
other
and
caught
it
by
the
nose
he
twisted
the
bear
s
nose
until
the
brute
let
loose
of
his
foot
then
he
quickly
drew
himself
into
the
tree
and
seated
himself
none
too
soon
astride
of
a
limb
illustration
the
bear
rose
to
climb
after
the
when
balser
had
fixed
himself
firmly
on
the
limb
he
proceeded
at
once
to
load
his
gun
this
was
no
slight
matter
under
the
circumstances
for
aside
from
the
fact
that
his
position
in
the
tree
was
an
uneasy
one
the
branches
were
in
his
way
when
he
began
to
use
his
ramrod
balser
had
hardly
poured
the
powder
into
his
gun
when
the
bear
again
rose
on
its
hind
legs
and
put
its
front
paws
upon
the
body
of
the
tree
with
evident
intent
to
climb
after
the
boy
who
had
wounded
it
and
had
so
insultingly
twisted
its
nose
bears
like
to
scratch
the
bark
of
trees
and
seem
to
take
the
same
pride
in
placing
their
marks
high
upon
the
that
a
young
man
does
in
making
a
long
jump
or
a
good
shot
vanity
in
this
case
proved
to
be
the
bear
s
undoing
as
it
has
often
been
with
men
and
boys
when
it
was
reaching
upward
to
make
a
high
scratch
that
it
thought
would
be
the
envy
of
every
bear
that
would
see
it
it
should
have
been
climbing
for
while
it
was
scratching
balser
was
loading
not
hurriedly
as
he
had
shot
but
slowly
and
deliberately
counting
one
two
three
with
every
movement
for
when
he
had
shot
so
hurriedly
a
few
minutes
before
and
had
only
wounded
the
bear
he
had
again
learned
the
great
lesson
to
make
haste
slowly
the
lesson
was
to
be
impressed
upon
balser
s
mind
more
firmly
than
ever
before
he
was
through
with
the
wounded
bear
for
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
never
forgot
the
events
which
befell
him
after
he
came
down
from
the
tree
although
balser
was
deliberate
he
had
no
time
to
waste
for
soon
the
bear
began
climbing
the
tree
aided
by
a
few
small
branches
upon
the
lower
part
of
the
trunk
which
had
given
help
to
balser
up
the
bear
went
slowly
and
surely
its
great
red
tongue
hung
out
at
one
side
of
its
mouth
and
its
black
woolly
coat
was
red
and
gory
with
blood
from
the
wound
that
balser
had
inflicted
upon
its
huge
neck
its
sharp
little
eyes
were
fixed
upon
balser
and
seemed
to
blaze
with
fury
and
rage
and
its
long
bright
teeth
gleamed
as
its
lips
were
drawn
back
in
anger
when
it
growled
still
the
bear
climbed
and
still
balser
was
loading
his
gun
would
he
have
it
loaded
before
the
bear
reached
him
now
the
powder
was
all
double
charge
now
the
first
patch
was
in
and
balser
was
trying
to
ram
it
home
the
branches
of
the
trees
were
in
his
way
and
the
ramrod
would
not
go
into
the
gun
inanimate
things
are
often
stubborn
just
when
docility
is
most
needed
ah
at
last
the
ramrod
is
in
and
the
first
patch
goes
home
hard
and
fast
upon
the
powder
on
comes
the
bear
paw
over
paw
foot
over
foot
taking
its
time
with
painful
deliberation
and
bearlike
carefully
choosing
its
way
for
it
thinks
full
sure
the
boy
can
not
escape
hurriedly
balser
reaches
into
his
pouch
for
a
bullet
he
finds
one
and
puts
it
to
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
ah
worse
luck
the
bullet
will
not
go
in
it
is
too
large
balser
feels
with
his
finger
a
little
ridge
extending
around
the
bullet
left
there
because
he
had
not
held
the
bullet
moulds
tightly
together
when
he
had
cast
the
bullet
the
boy
impatiently
throws
the
worthless
bullet
at
the
bear
and
puts
his
hand
into
the
pouch
for
another
this
time
the
bullet
goes
in
and
the
ramrod
drives
it
home
still
there
is
the
last
patch
to
drive
down
one
which
holds
the
bullet
still
the
bear
climbs
toward
its
intended
victim
its
growls
seem
to
shake
the
tree
and
its
eyes
look
like
burning
embers
the
patches
and
the
bullets
balser
kept
in
the
same
pouch
so
when
the
bullet
has
been
driven
home
the
boy
s
hand
again
goes
into
the
pouch
for
the
last
patch
he
can
find
nothing
but
bullets
down
goes
his
hand
to
each
corner
of
the
pouch
in
search
of
a
patch
but
alas
the
patch
like
a
false
friend
is
wanting
when
most
needed
on
comes
the
bear
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
a
patch
must
be
found
so
the
boy
snatches
off
his
cap
of
squirrel
skin
and
with
his
teeth
bites
out
a
piece
of
the
skin
which
will
answer
his
purpose
then
he
dashes
the
mutilated
cap
in
the
bear
s
face
only
a
foot
or
two
below
him
quickly
is
the
patch
driven
home
but
none
too
quickly
for
the
bear
is
at
balser
s
feet
reaching
for
him
with
his
great
rough
horny
paw
as
a
cat
reaches
for
a
mouse
balser
quickly
lifts
himself
to
the
limb
above
him
and
hurriedly
turning
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
right
into
the
great
red
mouth
pulls
the
trigger
bang
and
the
bear
falls
to
the
ground
where
it
lies
apparently
dead
it
was
only
apparently
dead
though
as
you
will
presently
see
balser
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
the
bear
fell
backward
for
he
was
sure
that
he
had
killed
it
no
bear
thought
he
could
survive
a
bullet
driven
by
the
heavy
charge
of
powder
behind
the
one
which
had
sped
so
truly
into
the
bear
s
mouth
again
balser
failed
to
make
haste
slowly
he
should
have
remained
in
his
secure
position
until
he
was
sure
that
the
bear
was
really
dead
for
a
badly
wounded
bear
although
at
the
point
of
death
is
more
dangerous
than
one
without
a
scar
without
looking
at
the
bear
balser
called
jim
to
come
to
him
and
began
climbing
down
the
tree
with
his
carbine
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
his
back
to
the
bear
all
this
happened
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
in
fact
the
time
during
which
balser
was
loading
his
gun
and
while
the
bear
was
climbing
the
tree
was
the
same
time
in
which
the
dogs
were
freeing
themselves
from
the
wagon
and
balser
s
second
shot
was
heard
by
jim
just
as
the
dogs
went
bounding
off
to
balser
s
relief
when
the
boy
jumped
to
the
ground
lo
the
bear
was
alive
again
and
was
on
its
feet
more
ferocious
than
ever
and
more
eager
for
fight
like
our
american
soldiers
the
bear
did
not
know
when
it
was
whipped
at
the
time
the
dogs
bounded
away
from
jim
there
came
down
the
path
toward
him
a
young
girl
who
do
you
think
it
was
liney
fox
she
was
carrying
in
her
hand
a
lighted
torch
and
was
swinging
it
gently
from
side
to
side
that
she
might
keep
it
ablaze
this
was
the
fire
which
liney
had
been
sent
to
borrow
she
had
heard
balser
s
cry
and
had
heard
both
the
shots
that
balser
had
fired
she
ran
quickly
to
jim
and
with
some
difficulty
drew
from
him
an
explanation
of
the
situation
then
as
the
dogs
bounded
away
she
followed
them
feeling
sure
that
their
instinct
would
lead
them
to
balser
the
girl
s
strength
seemed
to
be
increased
a
thousand
fold
and
she
ran
after
the
dogs
in
the
hope
that
she
might
help
the
boy
who
had
saved
her
life
upon
the
night
when
she
was
lost
in
the
forest
how
could
she
help
him
she
did
not
know
but
she
would
at
least
go
to
him
and
do
her
best
just
as
balser
reached
the
ground
the
bear
raised
itself
upon
its
hind
feet
and
struck
at
the
boy
but
missed
him
then
balser
ran
to
the
side
of
the
tree
opposite
the
bear
and
bear
and
boy
for
a
few
moments
played
at
a
desperate
game
of
around
the
tree
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
to
balser
he
soon
learned
that
the
bear
could
easily
beat
him
at
the
game
and
in
desperation
he
started
to
run
toward
the
river
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
away
he
cried
for
help
as
he
ran
and
at
that
moment
the
dogs
came
up
and
liney
followed
in
frantic
eager
haste
after
them
balser
had
thrown
away
his
gun
and
was
leading
the
bear
in
the
race
perhaps
six
or
eight
feet
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
bear
were
the
dogs
and
closer
than
you
would
think
upon
the
heels
of
the
dogs
came
liney
her
bonnet
had
fallen
back
and
her
hair
was
flying
behind
her
and
the
torch
was
all
ablaze
by
reason
of
its
rapid
movement
through
the
air
at
the
point
upon
the
river
s
bank
toward
which
balser
ran
was
a
little
stone
cliff
almost
perpendicular
the
top
of
which
was
eight
or
ten
feet
from
the
water
balser
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
he
could
reach
this
cliff
he
would
jump
into
the
river
and
perhaps
save
himself
in
that
manner
just
as
the
boy
reached
the
edge
of
the
cliff
liney
unfortunately
called
out
balser
her
voice
stopped
him
for
a
moment
and
he
looked
back
toward
her
in
that
moment
the
bear
overtook
him
and
felled
him
to
the
ground
with
a
stroke
of
its
paw
balser
felt
benumbed
and
was
almost
senseless
instantly
the
bear
was
standing
over
him
and
the
boy
was
blinded
by
the
stream
of
blood
which
flowed
into
his
eyes
and
over
his
face
from
the
wound
in
the
bear
s
great
mouth
he
felt
the
bear
shake
him
as
a
cat
shakes
a
mouse
and
then
for
a
moment
the
sun
seemed
to
go
out
and
all
was
dark
he
could
see
nothing
he
heard
the
dogs
bark
as
they
clung
to
the
bear
s
ears
and
neck
close
to
his
face
and
he
heard
liney
scream
but
it
all
seemed
like
a
dream
then
he
felt
something
burn
his
face
and
sparks
and
hot
ashes
fell
upon
his
skin
and
blistered
him
he
could
not
see
what
was
happening
but
the
pain
of
the
burns
seemed
to
revive
him
and
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
relieved
from
the
terrible
weight
of
the
bear
upon
his
breast
this
is
what
happened
after
balser
had
fallen
the
dogs
had
held
the
bear
s
attention
for
a
brief
moment
or
two
and
had
given
liney
time
to
reach
the
scene
of
conflict
the
bear
had
caught
balser
s
leather
coat
between
its
jaws
and
was
shaking
him
just
as
liney
came
up
it
is
said
that
the
shake
which
a
cat
gives
a
mouse
produces
unconsciousness
and
so
it
is
true
that
the
shake
which
the
larger
animals
give
to
their
prey
before
killing
it
has
a
benumbing
effect
such
as
balser
felt
when
liney
reached
balser
and
the
bear
she
had
no
weapon
but
her
torch
but
with
true
feminine
intuition
she
did
without
stopping
to
think
the
only
thing
she
could
do
and
for
that
matter
the
best
thing
that
any
one
could
have
done
she
thrust
the
burning
torch
into
the
bear
s
face
and
held
it
there
despite
its
rage
and
growls
then
it
was
that
balser
felt
the
heat
and
sparks
and
then
it
was
that
the
bear
blinded
by
the
fire
left
balser
the
bear
was
frantic
with
pain
and
began
to
rub
its
eyes
and
face
with
its
paws
just
as
a
man
would
do
under
the
same
circumstances
it
staggered
about
in
rage
and
blindness
making
the
forest
echo
with
its
frightful
growls
until
it
was
upon
the
edge
of
the
little
precipice
of
which
i
have
spoken
then
liney
struck
it
again
with
her
burning
torch
and
gave
it
a
push
which
although
her
strength
was
slight
sent
the
bear
rolling
over
the
cliff
into
the
river
after
that
she
ran
back
to
balser
who
was
still
lying
upon
the
ground
covered
with
blood
she
thought
he
was
terribly
wounded
so
she
tore
off
her
muslin
petticoat
and
wiped
the
blood
from
balser
s
face
and
hands
her
joy
was
great
when
she
learned
that
it
was
the
bear
s
blood
and
not
balser
s
that
she
saw
the
boy
soon
rose
to
his
feet
dazed
and
half
blinded
illustration
liney
thrust
the
burning
torch
into
the
bear
s
face
and
held
it
there
despite
its
rage
and
where
s
the
bear
he
asked
we
pushed
him
into
the
river
said
jim
who
had
come
in
at
the
last
moment
yes
we
pushed
him
in
said
balser
in
derision
liney
did
yes
answered
liney
i
don
t
know
how
i
did
it
but
after
i
had
put
my
torch
in
the
bear
s
face
when
he
was
over
you
pushed
him
into
the
and
she
cast
down
her
sweet
modest
eyes
as
if
ashamed
of
what
she
had
done
liney
began
balser
but
his
voice
was
choked
by
a
great
lump
of
sobs
in
his
throat
liney
he
began
again
but
his
gratitude
was
so
great
he
could
not
speak
he
tried
again
and
the
tears
came
in
a
flood
said
jim
jim
you
re
a
little
fool
said
liney
turning
upon
the
youngster
with
a
blaze
of
anger
in
her
eyes
jim
s
right
sobbed
balser
am
a
no
no
balser
said
liney
soothingly
as
she
took
his
hand
i
know
i
understand
without
you
telling
yes
sobbed
balser
you
so
don
t
say
that
balser
answered
liney
think
of
the
night
in
the
forest
and
think
of
what
you
did
for
oh
but
i
m
a
balser
was
badly
bruised
but
was
not
wounded
except
in
the
foot
where
the
bear
had
caught
him
as
he
climbed
the
tree
that
wound
however
was
slight
and
would
heal
quickly
the
cubs
had
broken
away
from
the
loaded
wagon
and
jim
liney
balser
dogs
and
cubs
all
marched
back
to
brent
s
in
a
slow
and
silent
procession
leaving
the
load
of
nuts
upon
the
path
and
the
bear
dead
upon
a
ripple
in
the
river
chapter
vii
the
fire
bear
one
evening
in
december
a
few
weeks
after
liney
had
saved
balser
s
life
by
means
of
the
borrowed
fire
balser
s
father
and
mother
and
and
fox
went
to
marion
a
town
of
two
houses
and
a
church
three
miles
away
to
attend
protracted
liney
and
tom
and
the
fox
baby
remained
with
balser
and
jim
and
the
brent
baby
at
the
brent
cabin
when
the
children
were
alone
liney
proceeded
to
put
the
babies
to
sleep
and
when
those
small
heads
of
their
respective
households
were
dead
to
the
world
in
slumber
rocked
to
that
happy
condition
in
a
cradle
made
from
the
half
of
a
round
smooth
log
hollowed
out
with
an
adze
the
other
children
huddled
together
in
the
fireplace
to
talk
and
to
play
games
chief
among
the
games
was
that
never
failing
source
of
delight
simon
says
thumbs
outside
the
house
the
wind
blowing
through
the
trees
of
the
forest
rose
and
sank
in
piteous
wails
and
moans
by
turns
and
the
snow
fell
in
angry
fitful
blasts
and
whirled
and
turned
eddied
and
drifted
as
if
it
were
a
thing
of
life
the
weather
was
bitter
cold
but
the
fire
on
the
great
hearth
in
front
of
the
children
seemed
to
feel
that
while
the
grown
folks
were
away
it
was
its
duty
to
be
careful
of
the
children
and
to
be
gentle
tender
and
comforting
to
them
so
it
spluttered
popped
and
cracked
like
the
sociable
amiable
and
fire
that
it
was
it
invited
the
children
to
go
near
it
and
to
take
its
warmth
and
told
as
plainly
as
a
fire
could
a
fire
can
talk
not
english
perhaps
but
a
very
understandable
language
of
its
own
it
would
not
burn
them
for
worlds
so
as
i
said
the
children
sat
inside
the
huge
fireplace
and
cared
little
whether
or
not
the
cold
north
wind
blew
after
simon
had
grown
tiresome
liney
told
riddles
all
of
which
tom
who
had
heard
them
before
spoiled
by
giving
the
answer
before
the
others
had
a
chance
to
guess
then
limpy
propounded
a
few
riddles
but
liney
who
had
often
heard
them
would
not
disappoint
her
brother
by
telling
the
answers
balser
noticed
this
and
said
limpy
you
ought
to
take
a
few
lessons
in
good
manners
from
your
why
ought
i
asked
tom
somewhat
indignantly
because
she
doesn
t
tell
your
riddles
as
you
told
hers
answered
balser
he
wants
to
show
off
said
jim
no
he
doesn
t
said
liney
but
she
cast
a
grateful
glance
at
balser
which
said
thank
you
as
plainly
as
if
she
had
spoken
the
words
tom
hung
his
head
and
said
he
didn
t
like
riddles
anyway
let
s
crack
some
nuts
proposed
jim
who
was
always
hungry
this
proposition
seemed
agreeable
to
all
so
balser
brought
in
a
large
gourd
filled
with
nuts
and
soon
they
were
all
busy
cracking
and
picking
then
liney
told
stories
from
the
pilgrim
s
progress
and
the
bible
she
was
at
the
most
thrilling
part
of
the
story
of
daniel
in
the
lions
den
and
her
listeners
were
eager
nervous
and
somewhat
fearful
when
the
faint
cry
of
help
seemed
to
come
right
down
through
the
mouth
of
the
chimney
listen
whispered
balser
holding
up
his
hands
for
silence
in
a
moment
came
again
the
cry
help
the
second
cry
was
still
faint
but
louder
than
the
first
and
the
children
sprang
together
with
a
common
impulse
and
clung
to
balser
in
unspoken
fear
help
help
came
the
cry
still
nearer
and
louder
some
one
wants
help
whispered
balser
the
latter
clause
was
spoken
rather
hesitatingly
no
no
cried
liney
you
must
not
go
it
may
be
indians
trying
to
get
you
out
there
to
kill
you
or
it
may
be
a
ghost
you
ll
surely
be
killed
if
you
liney
s
remark
somewhat
frightened
balser
and
completely
frightened
the
other
children
but
it
made
balser
feel
all
the
more
that
he
must
not
be
a
coward
before
her
however
much
he
feared
to
go
in
response
to
the
cry
for
help
he
must
not
let
liney
see
that
he
was
afraid
besides
the
boy
knew
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
and
although
with
balser
the
sense
of
duty
moved
more
slowly
than
the
sense
of
fear
yet
it
moved
more
surely
so
he
quickly
grasped
his
gun
and
carefully
examined
the
load
and
priming
then
he
took
a
torch
lighted
it
at
the
fire
and
out
he
rushed
into
the
blinding
freezing
storm
who
s
there
cried
balser
holding
his
torch
on
high
help
help
came
the
cry
from
a
short
distance
down
the
river
evidently
in
the
forest
back
of
the
barn
balser
hurried
in
the
direction
whence
the
cry
had
come
and
when
he
had
proceeded
one
hundred
yards
or
so
he
met
a
man
running
toward
him
almost
out
of
breath
from
fright
and
exhaustion
balser
s
torch
had
been
extinguished
by
the
wind
snow
and
sleet
and
he
could
not
see
the
man
s
face
who
are
you
and
what
s
the
matter
with
you
asked
brave
little
balser
meanwhile
keeping
his
gun
ready
to
shoot
if
need
be
don
t
you
know
me
balser
gasped
the
other
is
it
you
polly
asked
balser
what
on
earth
s
the
matter
the
fire
bear
the
fire
bear
cried
poll
he
s
been
chasin
me
fur
lord

how
long
there

him
he
s
movin
down
to
the
river
he
s
crossin
the
river
on
the
ice
now
there
there
and
he
pointed
in
the
direction
he
wished
balser
to
look
sure
enough
crossing
on
the
ice
below
the
barn
was
the
sharply
defined
form
of
a
large
bear
glowing
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
as
if
it
were
on
fire
this
was
more
than
even
balser
s
courage
could
withstand
so
he
started
for
the
house
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
and
polly
came
panting
and
screaming
at
his
heels
illustration
help
help
came
the
polly
s
name
i
may
say
was
samuel
parrott
he
was
a
harmless
simple
fellow
a
sort
of
of
the
settlement
and
his
surname
which
few
persons
remembered
had
suggested
the
nickname
of
poll
or
polly
by
which
he
was
known
far
and
wide
by
the
time
balser
had
reached
the
house
he
was
ashamed
of
his
precipitate
retreat
and
proposed
that
he
and
polly
should
go
out
and
further
investigate
the
fire
bear
this
proposition
met
with
such
a
decided
negative
from
polly
and
such
a
vehement
chorus
of
protests
from
liney
and
the
other
children
that
balser
with
reluctance
in
his
manner
but
gladness
in
his
heart
consented
to
remain
indoors
and
to
let
the
fire
bear
take
his
way
unmolested
when
did
you
first
see
him
asked
balser
of
polly
parrot
bout
a
mile
down
the
river
by
fox
s
bluff
responded
polly
i
ve
been
runnin
every
step
of
the
way
jist
as
hard
as
i
could
run
and
that
there
fire
bear
not
more
n
ten
feet
behind
me
growlin
like
thunder
and
blazin
and
smokin
away
like
a
nonsense
said
balser
he
wasn
t
blazing
when
i
saw
of
course
he
wasn
t
responded
poll
he
d
about
burned
out
d
ye
think
a
bear
could
blaze
away
forever
like
a
volcano
poll
s
logical
statement
seemed
to
be
convincing
to
the
children
and
he
blazed
up
did
he
asked
liney
her
bright
eyes
large
with
wonder
and
fear
blazed
up
ejaculated
polly
bless
your
soul
liney
don
t
you
see
how
hot
i
am
would
a
man
be
sweatin
like
i
am
on
such
a
night
as
this
unless
he
s
been
powerful
nigh
to
a
mighty
hot
fire
poll
s
corroborative
evidence
was
too
strong
for
doubt
to
contend
against
and
a
depressing
conviction
fell
upon
the
entire
company
including
balser
that
it
was
really
the
fire
bear
which
polly
and
balser
had
seen
although
balser
in
common
with
most
of
the
settlers
had
laughed
at
the
stories
of
the
fire
bear
which
had
been
told
in
the
settlement
yet
now
he
was
convinced
because
he
had
seen
it
with
his
own
eyes
it
was
true
that
the
bear
was
not
ablaze
when
he
saw
him
but
certainly
he
looked
like
a
great
glowing
ember
and
with
polly
s
testimony
balser
was
ready
to
believe
all
he
had
heard
concerning
this
most
frightful
spectre
of
blue
river
the
fire
bear
one
of
the
stories
concerning
the
fire
bear
was
to
the
effect
that
when
he
was
angry
he
blazed
forth
into
a
great
flame
and
that
when
he
was
not
angry
he
was
simply
aglow
at
times
when
the
forests
were
burned
or
when
barns
or
were
destroyed
by
fire
many
persons
especially
of
the
ignorant
class
attributed
the
incendiarism
to
the
fire
bear
others
who
pretended
to
more
wisdom
charged
the
indians
with
the
crimes
of
the
latter
class
had
been
balser
but
to
see
is
to
believe
another
superstition
about
the
fire
bear
was
that
any
person
who
should
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
behold
him
would
die
within
three
months
after
seeing
him
unless
perchance
he
could
kill
the
fire
bear
task
which
would
necessitate
the
use
of
a
potent
charm
for
the
fire
bear
bore
a
charmed
life
the
fire
bear
had
been
seen
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
by
eight
or
ten
persons
always
after
night
each
one
who
had
seen
the
bear
had
died
within
the
three
months
following
he
had
been
stalked
by
many
hunters
and
although
several
opportunities
to
kill
him
had
occurred
yet
no
one
had
accomplished
that
event
you
may
be
sure
there
were
no
more
games
riddles
or
that
evening
in
the
brent
cabin
the
children
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
a
frightened
group
and
then
took
their
old
places
on
the
logs
inside
the
fireplace
polly
who
was
stupid
with
fright
stood
for
a
short
time
silently
facing
the
fire
and
then
said
mournfully
balser
you
and
me
had
better
jine
the
church
we
re
goners
inside
the
next
three
months
just
as
sure
as
my
name
s
then
meditatively
a
durned
sight
surer
than
that
for
my
name
ain
t
polly
at
all
but
samuel
or
thomas
or
bill
or
something
like
that
i
furgit
which
but
we
re
goners
balser
and
we
might
as
well
git
ready
no
livin
bein
ever
seed
that
bear
and
was
alive
three
months
then
liney
who
was
sitting
next
to
balser
touched
his
arm
gently
and
said
i
saw
him
too
i
followed
you
a
short
way
when
you
went
out
and
i
saw
something
bright
crossing
the
river
on
the
ice
just
below
the
barn
was
that
the
bear
yes
yes
cried
balser
for
goodness
sake
liney
why
didn
t
you
stay
in
the
house
you
bet
i
stayed
in
said
jim
and
so
did
i
said
tom
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
what
jim
and
limpy
said
and
in
a
moment
liney
was
weeping
gently
with
her
face
in
her
hands
jim
and
limpy
then
began
to
cry
and
soon
polly
was
boohooing
as
if
he
were
already
at
the
point
of
death
it
required
all
of
balser
s
courage
and
strength
to
keep
back
the
tears
but
in
a
moment
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
stop
your
crying
everybody
i
ll
kill
that
bear
before
the
three
months
is
half
gone
yes
before
a
month
has
passed
if
liney
saw
him
the
bear
dies
that
settles
liney
looked
up
to
balser
gratefully
and
then
turning
to
polly
said
he
ll
save
us
polly
he
killed
the
bear
and
it
was
enough
sight
worse
to
fight
than
the
fire
bear
the
bear
was
a
polly
did
not
share
liney
s
confidence
so
he
sat
down
upon
the
hearth
and
gazed
sadly
at
the
fire
awhile
then
taking
his
elbow
for
his
pillow
he
lay
upon
the
floor
and
moaned
himself
to
sleep
the
children
sat
in
silence
for
a
short
time
and
jim
lay
down
beside
polly
and
closed
his
eyes
in
slumber
then
limpy
s
head
began
to
nod
and
soon
limpy
was
in
the
land
of
dreams
balser
and
liney
sat
upon
the
spare
backlog
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
without
speaking
the
deep
bed
of
live
coals
cast
a
rosy
glow
upon
their
faces
and
the
shadows
back
in
the
room
grew
darker
as
the
flame
of
the
neglected
fire
died
out
now
and
then
a
fitful
blaze
would
start
from
a
broken
ember
and
the
shadows
danced
for
a
moment
over
the
floor
and
ceiling
like
sombre
spectres
but
balser
and
liney
saw
them
not
despite
their
disbelief
in
the
existence
of
the
fire
bear
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
last
two
hours
had
brought
to
them
a
frightful
conviction
of
the
truth
of
all
they
had
heard
about
the
uncanny
fatal
monster
three
short
months
of
life
was
all
that
was
left
to
them
such
had
been
the
fate
of
all
who
had
beheld
the
fire
bear
such
certainly
would
be
their
fate
unless
balser
could
kill
event
upon
which
liney
built
much
greater
hope
than
did
balser
after
a
long
time
balser
spoke
in
a
low
tone
that
he
might
not
disturb
the
others
liney
if
i
only
had
a
charm
i
might
kill
the
fire
bear
but
a
gun
by
itself
can
do
nothing
against
a
monster
that
bears
a
charmed
life
we
must
have
a
charm
you
ve
read
so
many
books
and
you
know
so
much
can
t
you
think
of
a
charm
that
would
help
me
no
no
balser
sighed
liney
you
know
more
than
i
a
thousand
nonsense
liney
didn
t
you
spell
down
the
grown
at
caster
s
bee
yes
i
know
i
did
but
spelling
isn
t
everything
balser
it
s
mighty
little
and
don
t
teach
us
anything
about
charms
you
might
know
how
to
spell
every
word
in
a
big
book
and
still
know
nothing
about
i
guess
you
re
right
responded
balser
dolefully
i
wonder
how
we
can
learn
to
make
a
maybe
the
bible
would
teach
us
said
liney
they
say
it
teaches
us
nearly
i
expect
it
would
responded
balser
suppose
you
try
i
will
answered
liney
silence
ensued
once
more
broken
only
by
the
moaning
wind
and
the
occasional
popping
of
the
backlog
after
a
few
minutes
liney
said
in
a
whisper
balser
i
ve
been
thinking
and
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
something
i
have
it
s
a
great
secret
no
one
knows
of
it
but
mother
and
father
and
i
believe
it
s
the
very
thing
we
want
for
a
charm
it
looks
like
it
and
it
has
strange
words
engraved
upon
balser
was
alive
with
interest
do
you
promise
never
to
tell
any
one
about
it
asked
liney
yes
yes
indeed
cross
my
heart
pon
honour
hope
to
balser
s
plain
unadorned
promise
was
enough
to
bind
him
to
secrecy
under
ordinary
circumstances
for
he
was
a
truthful
boy
but
when
his
lips
were
sealed
by
such
oaths
as
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
death
had
no
terrors
which
would
have
forced
him
to
divulge
what
is
it
quick
quick
liney
you
ll
never
tell
no
cross
well
i
ll
tell
you
i
ve
a
thing
at
home
that
s
almost
like
a
cross
only
the
pieces
cross
each
other
in
the
middle
and
are
broad
at
each
end
it
s
a
little
larger
than
a
big
button
it
s
gold
on
the
back
and
has
a
lot
of
pieces
of
glass
each
the
size
of
a
small
pea
on
the
front
side
only
i
don
t
believe
they
re
glass
at
all
they
are
too
bright
for
glass
you
can
see
them
in
the
dark
where
there
s
no
light
at
all
they
shine
and
glitter
and
sparkle
so
that
it
almost
makes
you
blink
your
eyes
now
you
never
saw
glass
like
that
did
you
no
answered
balser
positively
liney
continued
that
s
what
makes
me
think
it
s
a
charm
for
you
couldn
t
see
it
in
the
dark
unless
it
was
a
charm
could
you
balser
i
should
think
there
s
a
great
big
piece
of
glass
or
whatever
it
is
in
the
centre
of
big
as
a
large
pea
and
around
this
big
piece
are
four
words
in
some
strange
language
that
nobody
can
make
out
least
mother
says
that
nobody
in
this
country
can
make
them
out
mother
told
me
that
the
charm
was
given
to
her
for
me
by
a
gypsy
man
when
i
was
a
baby
mother
says
there
s
something
more
to
tell
me
about
it
when
i
become
a
woman
maybe
that
s
the
charm
of
it
i
m
sure
it
and
she
looked
up
to
balser
with
her
soft
bright
eyes
full
of
inquiry
and
hope
i
do
believe
that
thing
is
a
charm
said
balser
then
meditatively
i
know
it
s
a
charm
don
t
tell
me
liney
that
you
don
t
know
a
lot
of
liney
s
sad
face
wore
a
dim
smile
of
satisfaction
at
balser
s
compliments
and
again
they
both
became
silent
balser
remained
in
a
brown
study
for
a
few
moments
and
then
asked
where
does
your
mother
keep
charm
she
keeps
it
in
a
box
under
my
good
good
responded
balser
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
to
make
it
a
sure
enough
yes
yes
eagerly
interrupted
liney
you
take
the
charm
and
hold
it
on
your
lips
while
you
pray
seven
times
that
i
may
kill
the
bear
do
that
seven
times
for
seven
nights
and
on
the
last
night
i
ll
get
the
charm
and
polly
limpey
and
i
will
go
out
and
kill
the
bear
just
as
sure
as
you
re
the
plan
brought
comfort
to
the
boy
and
girl
soon
liney
s
eyes
became
heavy
and
she
fell
asleep
and
as
balser
looked
upon
her
innocent
beauty
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
if
seven
times
seven
prayers
from
liney
s
lips
could
not
make
a
charm
which
would
give
him
strength
from
on
high
to
kill
the
bear
there
was
no
strength
sufficient
for
that
task
to
be
had
any
place
late
in
the
o
parents
of
the
children
came
home
the
sleepers
were
aroused
and
all
of
them
tried
to
tell
the
story
of
the
fire
bear
at
one
and
the
same
time
tell
me
about
it
balser
said
fox
seriously
for
he
too
was
beginning
to
believe
in
the
story
of
the
fire
bear
then
balser
told
the
story
assisted
by
polly
and
the
strange
event
was
discussed
until
late
into
the
night
without
however
the
slightest
reference
to
the
charm
by
either
balser
or
liney
that
was
to
remain
their
secret
and
fox
remained
with
the
brents
all
night
and
before
they
left
next
morning
liney
whispered
to
balser
i
ll
begin
as
you
told
me
to
do
with
the
charm
seven
nights
from
this
the
charm
will
be
i
can
make
and
so
will
i
be
ready
answered
balser
and
both
felt
that
the
fate
of
the
fire
bear
was
sealed
chapter
viii
the
black
gully
author
fearing
that
the
account
of
fire
springing
from
the
earth
given
in
the
following
story
may
be
considered
by
the
reader
too
improbable
for
any
book
but
one
of
arabian
fables
wishes
to
say
that
the
fire
and
the
explosion
occurred
in
the
place
and
manner
described
the
fire
bear
had
never
before
been
seen
in
the
blue
river
neighbourhood
his
former
appearances
had
been
at
or
near
the
mouth
of
conn
s
creek
where
that
stream
flows
into
flatrock
five
or
six
miles
southeast
of
balser
s
home
flatrock
river
takes
its
name
from
the
fact
that
it
flows
over
layers
of
broad
flat
rocks
the
soil
in
its
vicinity
is
underlaid
at
a
depth
of
a
few
feet
by
a
formation
of
stratified
limestone
which
crops
out
on
the
hillsides
and
precipices
and
in
many
places
forms
deep
crevasses
through
which
the
river
flows
in
these
cliffs
and
miniature
cañons
are
many
caves
and
branching
off
from
the
river
s
course
are
many
small
or
gullies
which
at
night
are
black
and
repellent
and
in
many
instances
are
quite
difficult
to
explore
one
of
these
was
so
dark
and
forbidding
that
it
was
called
by
the
settlers
the
black
the
conformation
of
the
rocks
composing
its
precipitous
sides
was
grotesque
in
the
extreme
and
the
overhanging
trees
thickly
covered
with
vines
cast
so
deep
a
shadow
upon
the
ravine
that
even
at
midday
its
dark
recesses
bore
a
cast
of
gloom
like
that
of
night
untimely
fallen
how
balser
happened
to
visit
the
black
gully
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
saw
terrible
and
to
cause
the
bravest
man
to
shall
soon
tell
you
the
country
in
the
vicinity
of
flatrock
was
full
of
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
the
home
of
the
fire
bear
the
morning
after
polly
and
balser
had
seen
the
fire
bear
they
went
forth
bright
and
early
to
follow
the
tracks
of
their
fiery
enemy
and
if
possible
to
learn
where
he
had
gone
after
his
unwelcome
visit
they
took
up
the
spoor
at
the
point
where
the
bear
had
crossed
the
river
the
night
before
and
easily
followed
his
path
three
or
four
miles
down
the
stream
there
they
found
the
place
where
he
had
crossed
the
river
to
the
east
bank
the
tracks
which
were
plainly
visible
in
the
snow
there
turned
southeast
toward
his
reputed
home
among
the
caves
and
gullies
of
flatrock
and
conn
s
creek
the
trackers
hurried
forward
so
eagerly
in
their
pursuit
that
they
felt
no
fatigue
they
found
several
deer
and
at
one
time
they
saw
at
a
great
distance
a
bear
but
they
did
not
pursue
either
for
their
minds
were
too
full
of
the
hope
that
they
might
discover
the
haunts
of
the
monster
upon
whose
death
depended
as
they
believed
their
lives
and
that
of
liney
fox
when
balser
and
polly
reached
the
stony
ground
of
flatrock
the
bear
tracks
began
to
grow
indistinct
and
soon
they
were
lost
entirely
among
the
smooth
rocks
from
which
the
snow
had
been
blown
away
the
boys
had
however
accomplished
their
purpose
for
they
were
convinced
that
they
had
discovered
the
haunts
of
the
bear
they
carefully
noticed
the
surrounding
country
and
spoke
to
each
other
of
the
peculiar
cliffs
and
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
so
that
they
might
remember
the
place
when
they
should
return
then
they
found
a
dry
little
cave
wherein
they
kindled
a
fire
and
roasted
a
piece
of
venison
which
they
had
taken
with
them
when
their
roast
was
cooked
they
ate
their
dinner
of
cold
and
venison
and
then
sat
by
the
fire
for
an
hour
to
warm
and
rest
before
beginning
their
long
hard
journey
home
through
the
snow
polly
smoked
his
pipe
pipe
was
a
hollow
with
the
tip
of
a
buck
s
horn
for
a
stem
the
two
bear
hunters
talked
over
the
events
of
the
day
and
discussed
the
coming
campaign
against
the
fire
bear
i
s
pose
we
ll
have
to
hunt
him
by
night
said
polly
he
s
never
seen
at
any
other
time
they
yes
we
ll
have
to
hunt
him
by
night
said
balser
but
darkness
will
help
us
in
the
hunt
for
we
can
see
him
better
at
night
than
at
any
other
time
and
he
can
t
see
us
as
well
as
he
could
in
balser
you
surprise
me
answered
polly
have
you
hunted
bears
all
this
time
and
don
t
know
that
a
bear
can
see
as
well
after
night
as
in
the
maybe
maybe
that
s
so
responded
balser
i
know
that
cats
and
owls
can
see
better
by
night
but
i
didn
t
know
about
bears
how
do
you
know
it
s
true
how
do
i
know
why
didn
t
that
there
bear
make
a
for
this
place
last
night
and
wasn
t
last
night
as
dark
as
the
inside
of
a
whale
and
don
t
they
go
about
at
night
more
than
in
the
daytime
tell
me
that
when
do
they
steal
sheep
and
shoats
in
daytime
tell
me
that
ain
t
it
always
at
night
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
bear
stealing
a
shoat
in
the
daytime
no
sirree
but
they
can
see
the
littlest
shoat
that
ever
grunted
on
the
darkest
night
him
and
snatch
him
out
of
the
pen
and
get
away
with
him
quicker
than
you
or
i
could
a
durned
i
never
tried
did
you
polly
asked
balser
polly
wasn
t
above
suspicion
among
those
who
knew
him
and
balser
s
question
slightly
disconcerted
him
well
if
that
ain
t
the
worst
fool
question
i
ever
heerd
a
boy
ask
answered
polly
then
somewhat
anxious
to
change
the
conversation
he
continued
what
night
do
you
propose
to
come
down
here
night
no
not
for
a
week
not
till
seven
nights
after
answered
balser
mindful
of
the
charm
which
he
hoped
liney
s
prayers
would
make
for
him
seven
nights
geminy
i
m
afraid
i
ll
get
scared
of
this
place
by
that
time
i
ll
bet
this
is
an
awful
place
at
night
nothing
but
great
chunks
of
blackness
in
these
here
gullies
so
thick
you
could
cut
it
with
a
knife
i
m
not
afraid
now
because
i
m
desperate
i
m
so
afraid
of
dyin
because
i
saw
the
fire
bear
that
i
don
t
seem
to
be
afraid
of
nothin
polly
was
right
there
is
nothing
like
a
to
keep
a
coward
s
courage
up
after
they
were
warm
and
had
rested
balser
and
polly
went
out
of
the
cave
and
took
another
survey
of
the
surrounding
country
from
the
top
of
the
hill
they
started
homeward
and
reached
the
cozy
cabin
on
blue
river
soon
after
sunset
tired
hungry
and
cold
a
good
warm
supper
soon
revived
them
and
as
it
had
been
agreed
that
polly
should
remain
at
brent
s
until
after
the
fire
bear
hunt
they
went
to
bed
in
the
loft
and
slept
soundly
till
morning
after
balser
announced
his
determination
to
hunt
the
fire
bear
many
persons
asked
him
when
he
intended
to
undertake
the
perilous
task
but
the
invariable
answer
he
gave
was
that
he
would
begin
after
the
seventh
night
from
the
one
upon
which
the
fire
bear
had
visited
blue
river
why
after
the
seventh
night
was
frequently
asked
but
the
boy
would
give
no
other
answer
balser
had
invited
tom
fox
to
go
with
him
and
tom
in
addition
to
his
redoubtable
hatchet
intended
to
carry
his
father
s
gun
polly
would
take
brent
s
rifle
and
of
course
balser
would
carry
the
greatest
of
all
armaments
his
carbine
great
were
the
preparations
made
in
selecting
bullets
and
in
drying
powder
knives
and
hatchets
were
sharpened
until
they
were
almost
as
keen
as
a
razor
many
of
the
men
and
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
volunteered
to
accompany
balser
but
he
would
take
with
him
no
one
but
tom
and
polly
too
many
hunters
spoil
the
chase
said
balser
borrowing
his
thought
from
the
cooks
and
the
broth
maxim
upon
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
balser
went
over
to
see
liney
and
to
receive
from
her
the
precious
charm
redolent
with
prayers
from
her
pure
heart
when
she
gave
it
to
him
he
said
it
s
a
charm
i
know
it
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
affectionately
it
looks
like
a
charm
and
it
feels
like
a
charm
liney
i
seem
to
feel
your
prayers
upon
ah
balser
don
t
say
that
it
sounds
almost
wicked
it
has
seemed
wicked
all
the
time
for
me
to
try
to
make
a
don
t
feel
that
way
liney
you
didn
t
try
to
make
it
you
only
prayed
to
god
to
make
it
and
god
is
good
and
loves
to
hear
you
pray
if
he
don
t
love
to
hear
you
pray
liney
he
don
t
love
to
hear
any
no
no
balser
i
m
so
wicked
the
night
we
saw
the
fire
bear
father
read
in
the
bible
where
it
says
the
prayers
of
the
wicked
availeth
oh
balser
do
you
think
it
s
wicked
to
try
to
make
a
is
to
pray
to
god
to
make
one
no
indeed
liney
god
makes
them
of
his
own
accord
he
made
but
liney
only
half
understood
the
charm
worked
at
least
one
spell
it
made
the
boy
braver
and
gave
him
balser
tom
and
polly
had
determined
to
ride
down
to
flatrock
on
horseback
and
for
that
purpose
one
of
fox
s
horses
and
two
of
brent
s
were
brought
into
service
at
three
o
clock
upon
the
famous
eighth
day
the
three
hunters
started
for
flatrock
and
spent
the
night
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mouth
of
conn
s
creek
but
they
did
not
see
the
fire
bear
four
other
expeditions
were
made
for
balser
had
no
notion
of
giving
up
the
hunt
and
each
expedition
was
a
failure
but
the
i
will
tell
you
about
it
upon
the
fifth
expedition
the
boys
reached
flatrock
river
just
after
sunset
a
cold
drizzling
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
as
it
fell
it
froze
upon
the
surface
of
the
rocks
the
wind
blew
and
moaned
through
the
and
the
darkness
was
so
dense
it
seemed
heavy
the
boys
had
tied
their
horses
in
a
cave
which
they
had
used
for
the
same
purpose
upon
former
visits
and
were
discussing
the
advisability
of
giving
up
the
hunt
for
that
night
and
returning
home
tom
had
suggested
that
the
rain
might
extinguish
the
fire
bear
s
fire
so
he
could
not
be
seen
the
theory
seemed
plausible
polly
thought
that
a
bear
with
any
sense
at
all
would
remain
at
home
in
his
cave
upon
such
a
night
as
that
and
all
these
arguments
together
with
the
slippery
condition
of
the
earth
which
made
walking
among
the
rocks
and
cliffs
very
dangerous
induced
balser
to
conclude
that
it
was
best
to
return
to
blue
river
without
pursuing
the
hunt
that
night
he
announced
his
decision
and
had
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
the
fire
bear
upon
that
expedition
but
they
were
not
to
be
disappointed
after
all
for
just
as
the
boys
were
untying
their
horses
to
return
home
a
terrific
growl
greeted
their
ears
coming
it
seemed
right
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
in
which
they
stood
that
s
him
cried
polly
i
know
his
voice
i
heerd
it
for
one
mortal
hour
that
night
when
he
was
a
chasin
me
and
i
ll
never
furgit
it
i
d
know
it
among
a
thousand
bears
it
s
him
oh
balser
let
s
go
home
for
the
lord
s
sake
balser
let
s
go
home
i
d
rather
die
three
months
from
now
than
now
three
months
is
a
long
time
to
live
after
polly
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
are
you
crazy
tie
up
your
horse
at
once
said
balser
if
the
bear
gets
away
from
us
this
time
we
ll
never
have
another
chance
at
him
quick
quick
polly
s
courage
was
soon
restored
and
the
horses
were
quickly
tied
again
upon
entering
the
cave
a
torch
had
been
lighted
and
by
the
light
of
the
torch
which
polly
held
the
primings
of
the
guns
were
examined
knives
and
hatchets
were
made
ready
for
immediate
use
and
out
the
hunters
sallied
in
pursuit
of
the
fire
bear
on
account
of
the
ice
upon
the
rocks
it
was
determined
that
polly
should
carry
the
torch
with
him
aside
from
the
dangers
of
the
slippery
path
there
was
another
reason
for
carrying
the
torch
fire
attracts
the
attention
of
wild
animals
and
often
prevents
them
from
running
away
from
the
hunter
this
is
especially
true
of
deer
so
polly
carried
the
torch
and
a
fatal
burden
it
proved
to
be
for
him
after
the
hunters
had
emerged
from
the
cave
they
at
once
started
toward
the
river
and
upon
passing
a
little
spur
of
the
hill
they
beheld
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
the
fire
bear
glowing
like
a
fiery
heap
against
the
black
bank
of
night
he
was
running
rapidly
up
the
stream
toward
black
gully
which
came
down
to
the
river
s
edge
between
high
cliffs
this
was
the
place
i
described
to
you
a
few
pages
back
balser
and
polly
had
seen
black
gully
before
and
had
noticed
how
dark
deep
and
forbidding
it
was
it
had
seemed
to
them
to
be
a
fitting
place
for
the
revels
of
witches
demons
snakes
and
monsters
of
all
sorts
and
they
thought
surely
it
was
haunted
if
any
place
ever
was
they
feared
the
spot
even
in
the
daytime
polly
who
was
ingenious
with
a
had
carved
out
three
whistles
and
in
the
bowl
of
each
was
a
pea
these
whistles
produced
a
shrill
noise
when
blown
upon
which
could
be
heard
at
a
great
distance
and
each
hunter
carried
one
fastened
to
a
string
about
his
neck
in
case
the
boys
should
be
separated
one
long
whistle
was
to
be
sounded
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
them
together
three
whistles
should
mean
that
the
bear
had
been
seen
and
one
short
one
was
to
be
the
cry
for
help
when
balser
saw
the
bear
he
blew
a
shrill
blast
upon
his
whistle
to
attract
the
brute
s
attention
the
ruse
produced
the
desired
effect
for
the
bear
stopped
his
curiosity
evidently
was
aroused
by
the
noise
and
by
the
sight
of
the
fire
and
he
remained
standing
for
a
moment
or
two
while
the
boys
ran
forward
as
rapidly
as
the
slippery
rocks
would
permit
soon
they
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
bear
then
fifty
forty
thirty
twenty
still
the
fire
bear
did
not
move
his
glowing
form
stood
before
them
like
a
pillar
of
fire
the
only
object
that
could
be
seen
in
the
darkness
that
surrounded
him
he
seemed
to
be
the
incarnation
of
all
that
was
brave
and
demoniac
when
within
twenty
yards
of
the
bear
balser
said
hurriedly
to
his
companions
halt
i
ll
shoot
first
and
you
fellows
hold
your
fire
and
shoot
one
at
a
time
after
me
don
t
shoot
till
i
tell
you
and
take
good
aim
polly
i
ll
hold
your
torch
when
i
want
you
to
polly
held
the
torch
in
one
hand
and
his
gun
in
the
other
and
fear
was
working
great
havoc
with
his
usefulness
balser
continued
it
s
so
dark
we
can
t
see
the
sights
of
our
guns
and
if
we
re
not
careful
we
may
all
miss
the
bear
or
still
worse
we
may
only
wound
him
hold
up
the
torch
polly
so
i
can
see
the
sights
of
my
illustration
now
hold
up
the
torch
balser
s
voice
seemed
to
attract
the
bear
s
attention
more
even
than
did
the
torch
and
he
pricked
up
his
short
fiery
ears
as
if
to
ask
what
are
you
talking
about
when
balser
spoke
next
it
was
with
a
tongue
of
fire
and
the
words
came
from
his
gun
the
bear
seemed
to
understand
the
gun
s
language
better
than
that
of
balser
for
he
gave
forth
in
answer
a
terrific
growl
of
rage
and
bit
savagely
at
the
wound
which
balser
had
inflicted
alas
it
was
only
a
wound
for
balser
s
bullet
instead
of
piercing
the
bear
s
heart
had
hit
him
upon
the
hind
quarters
i
ve
only
wounded
him
cried
balser
and
the
note
of
terror
in
his
voice
seemed
to
create
a
panic
in
the
breasts
of
tom
and
polly
who
at
once
raised
their
guns
and
fired
of
course
they
both
missed
the
bear
and
before
they
could
lower
their
guns
the
monster
was
upon
them
balser
was
in
front
and
received
the
full
force
of
the
brute
s
ferocious
charge
the
boy
went
down
under
the
bear
s
mighty
rush
and
before
he
had
time
to
draw
his
knife
or
to
disengage
his
hatchet
from
his
belt
the
infuriated
animal
was
standing
over
him
as
balser
fell
his
hand
caught
a
rough
piece
of
soft
wood
which
was
lying
upon
the
ground
and
with
this
he
tried
to
beat
the
bear
upon
the
head
the
bear
of
course
hardly
felt
the
blows
which
balser
dealt
with
the
piece
of
wood
and
it
seemed
that
another
terrible
proof
was
about
to
be
given
of
the
fatal
consequences
of
looking
upon
the
fire
bear
tom
and
polly
had
both
run
when
the
bear
charged
but
tom
quickly
came
to
balser
s
relief
while
polly
remained
at
a
safe
distance
the
bear
was
reaching
for
balser
s
throat
but
by
some
fortunate
chance
he
caught
between
his
jaws
the
piece
of
wood
with
which
balser
had
been
vainly
striking
him
and
doubtless
thinking
that
the
wood
was
a
part
of
balser
the
bear
bit
it
and
shook
it
ferociously
when
tom
came
up
to
the
scene
of
conflict
he
struck
the
bear
upon
the
head
with
the
sharp
edge
of
his
hatchet
and
chopped
out
one
of
his
eyes
the
pain
of
the
wound
seemed
to
double
the
bear
s
fury
and
he
sprang
over
balser
s
prostrate
form
toward
tom
the
bear
rose
upon
his
haunches
and
faced
tom
who
manfully
struck
at
him
with
his
hatchet
and
never
thought
of
running
ah
tom
was
a
brave
one
when
the
necessity
for
bravery
arose
but
tom
s
courage
was
better
than
his
judgment
for
in
a
moment
he
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
a
stroke
from
the
bear
s
paw
and
the
bear
was
standing
over
him
growling
and
bleeding
terribly
polly
had
come
nearer
and
his
torch
threw
a
ghastly
glamour
over
the
terrible
scene
as
in
the
fight
with
balser
the
bear
tried
to
catch
tom
s
throat
between
his
jaws
but
here
the
soft
piece
of
wood
which
balser
had
grasped
when
he
fell
proved
a
friend
indeed
for
the
bear
had
bitten
it
so
savagely
that
his
teeth
had
been
embedded
in
its
soft
fibre
and
it
acted
as
a
gag
in
his
mouth
he
could
neither
open
nor
close
his
jaws
after
a
few
frantic
efforts
to
bite
tom
the
bear
seemed
to
discover
where
the
trouble
was
and
tried
to
push
the
wood
out
of
his
mouth
with
his
paws
this
gave
tom
a
opportunity
of
which
he
was
not
slow
to
take
advantage
and
he
quickly
drew
himself
from
under
the
bear
rose
to
his
feet
and
ran
away
in
the
meantime
balser
rose
from
the
ground
and
reached
the
bear
just
as
tom
started
to
run
balser
knew
by
that
time
that
he
had
no
chance
of
success
in
a
conflict
with
the
brute
so
he
struck
the
bear
a
blow
upon
the
head
with
his
hatchet
as
he
passed
and
followed
tom
at
a
very
rapid
speed
balser
at
once
determined
that
he
and
tom
and
polly
should
reach
a
place
of
safety
quickly
load
their
guns
and
return
to
the
attack
in
a
moment
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
bear
still
struggling
to
free
his
mouth
from
the
piece
of
wood
which
had
saved
two
lives
that
night
as
the
bear
was
not
pursuing
them
balser
concluded
to
halt
and
he
and
tom
loaded
their
guns
while
polly
held
the
torch
on
high
to
furnish
light
polly
s
feeble
wits
had
almost
fled
and
he
seemed
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
about
him
he
did
mechanically
whatever
balser
told
him
to
do
but
his
eyes
had
a
look
and
it
was
evident
that
the
events
of
the
night
had
paralyzed
his
poor
weak
brain
when
the
guns
were
loaded
balser
and
tom
hurried
forward
toward
the
bear
and
poor
polly
followed
bearing
his
torch
bang
went
balser
s
gun
and
the
bear
rose
upon
his
hind
feet
making
the
cliffs
and
ravines
echo
with
his
terrible
growls
take
good
aim
tom
hold
up
the
torch
polly
said
balser
fire
and
the
bear
fell
over
on
his
back
and
seemed
to
be
dead
polly
and
tom
started
toward
the
bear
but
balser
cried
out
stop
he
may
not
be
dead
yet
we
ll
give
him
another
volley
we
ve
got
him
now
sure
if
we
re
tom
and
polly
stopped
and
it
was
fortunate
for
them
that
they
did
so
for
in
an
instant
the
bear
was
on
his
feet
apparently
none
the
worse
for
the
the
boys
had
given
him
the
fire
bear
stood
for
a
little
time
undetermined
whether
to
attack
the
boys
again
or
to
run
after
halting
for
a
moment
between
two
opinions
he
concluded
to
retreat
and
with
the
piece
of
wood
still
in
his
mouth
he
started
at
a
rapid
gait
toward
black
gully
a
hundred
yards
away
load
tom
load
quick
hold
the
torch
polly
cried
balser
and
again
the
guns
were
loaded
while
poor
demented
polly
held
the
torch
the
bear
moved
away
rapidly
and
in
a
moment
the
boys
were
following
him
with
loaded
guns
when
the
brute
reached
the
mouth
of
black
gully
he
entered
it
evidently
his
home
was
in
that
uncanny
place
quick
quick
polly
cried
balser
and
within
a
moment
after
the
bear
had
entered
black
gully
his
pursuers
were
at
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
making
ready
for
another
attack
balser
gave
a
shrill
blast
upon
his
whistle
and
the
bear
turned
for
a
moment
and
deliberately
sat
down
upon
his
haunches
not
fifty
yards
away
the
place
looked
so
black
and
dismal
that
the
boys
at
first
feared
to
enter
but
soon
their
courage
came
to
their
rescue
and
they
marched
in
with
polly
in
the
lead
the
bear
moved
farther
up
the
gully
toward
an
overhanging
cliff
whose
dark
rugged
outlines
were
faintly
illumined
by
the
light
of
polly
s
torch
the
jutting
rocks
seemed
like
monster
faces
and
the
bare
roots
of
the
trees
were
like
the
horny
fingers
and
the
bony
arms
of
fiends
the
boys
followed
the
bear
and
when
he
came
to
a
halt
near
the
cliff
and
again
sat
upon
his
haunches
it
was
evident
that
the
fire
bear
s
end
was
near
at
hand
how
frightful
it
all
appeared
there
sat
the
fire
bear
like
a
burning
demon
sullen
and
motionless
giving
forth
every
few
seconds
deep
guttural
growls
that
reverberated
through
the
dark
cavernous
place
not
a
star
was
seen
nor
a
gleam
of
light
did
the
overcast
sky
afford
there
stood
poor
piteous
polly
all
his
senses
fled
and
gone
unconsciously
holding
his
torch
above
his
head
the
light
of
the
torch
seemed
to
give
life
to
the
shadows
of
the
place
and
a
sense
of
fear
stole
over
balser
that
he
could
not
resist
let
s
shoot
him
again
and
get
out
of
this
awful
place
said
balser
you
bet
i
m
willing
to
get
out
said
tom
his
teeth
chattering
notwithstanding
his
wonted
courage
hold
the
torch
polly
cried
balser
and
polly
raised
the
torch
the
boys
were
within
fifteen
yards
of
the
bear
and
each
took
deliberate
aim
and
fired
the
bear
moaned
and
fell
forward
then
balser
and
tom
started
rapidly
toward
the
mouth
of
the
gully
when
they
had
almost
reached
the
opening
they
looked
back
for
polly
who
they
thought
was
following
them
but
there
he
stood
where
they
had
left
him
a
hundred
yards
behind
them
balser
called
polly
polly
but
polly
did
not
move
then
tom
blew
his
whistle
and
polly
started
not
toward
them
alas
but
toward
the
bear
don
t
go
to
him
polly
cried
balser
he
may
not
be
dead
we
ve
had
enough
of
him
for
goodness
sake
we
ll
come
back
and
find
him
but
polly
continued
walking
slowly
toward
the
bear
illustration
polly
continued
slowly
toward
the
polly
polly
come
back
cried
both
the
boys
but
polly
by
that
time
was
within
ten
feet
of
the
bear
holding
his
torch
and
moving
with
the
step
of
one
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
a
few
steps
more
and
polly
was
by
the
side
of
the
terrible
fire
bear
the
bear
revived
for
a
moment
and
seemed
conscious
that
an
enemy
was
near
him
with
a
last
mighty
effort
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
struck
polly
a
blow
with
his
paw
which
felled
him
to
the
ground
when
polly
fell
the
fire
bear
fell
upon
him
and
balser
and
tom
started
to
rescue
their
unfortunate
friend
then
it
was
that
a
terrible
thing
happened
when
polly
s
torch
dropped
from
his
hand
a
blue
flame
three
or
four
feet
in
height
sprang
from
the
ground
just
beyond
the
bear
the
fire
ran
upon
the
ground
for
a
short
distance
like
a
serpent
of
flame
and
shot
like
a
flash
of
chain
lightning
up
the
side
of
the
cliff
the
dark
jutting
demon
faces
covered
with
in
the
light
of
the
blaze
and
the
place
seemed
to
have
been
transformed
into
a
veritable
genii
s
cavern
the
flames
sank
away
for
a
moment
with
a
low
moaning
sound
and
then
came
up
again
the
colour
of
roses
and
of
blood
a
great
rumbling
noise
was
heard
coming
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
a
tongue
of
fire
shot
twenty
feet
into
the
air
this
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
endure
and
balser
and
tom
ran
for
their
lives
leaving
their
poor
demented
friend
behind
them
to
perish
out
the
boys
went
through
the
mouth
of
the
gully
and
across
the
river
they
sped
upon
the
ice
they
felt
the
earth
tremble
beneath
their
feet
and
they
heard
the
frightful
rumbling
again
then
a
loud
explosion
like
the
boom
of
a
hundred
cannons
and
the
country
for
miles
around
was
lighted
as
if
by
the
midday
sun
then
they
looked
back
and
beheld
a
sight
which
no
man
could
forget
to
the
day
of
his
death
they
saw
a
bright
red
flame
a
hundred
yards
in
diameter
and
two
hundred
feet
high
leap
from
the
black
gully
above
the
top
of
the
cliffs
after
a
moment
great
rocks
and
pieces
of
earth
half
as
large
as
a
house
began
to
fall
upon
every
side
of
them
as
if
a
mighty
volcano
had
burst
forth
and
the
boys
clung
to
each
other
in
fear
and
trembling
and
felt
sure
that
judgment
day
had
come
after
the
rocks
had
ceased
to
fall
the
boys
almost
dead
with
fright
walked
a
short
distance
down
the
river
and
crossed
upon
the
ice
the
fire
was
still
burning
in
the
black
gully
and
there
was
no
need
of
polly
s
torch
to
help
them
see
the
slippery
path
among
the
rocks
the
boys
soon
found
the
cave
in
which
the
horses
were
stabled
they
lost
no
time
in
mounting
and
quickly
started
home
leading
between
them
the
horse
which
had
been
ridden
by
polly
poor
polly
was
never
seen
again
even
after
the
fire
in
the
black
gully
had
receded
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
whence
it
had
come
nothing
was
found
of
his
body
nor
that
of
the
fire
bear
they
had
each
been
burned
to
cinder
many
of
the
blue
river
people
did
not
believe
that
the
fire
bear
derived
its
fiery
appearance
from
supernatural
causes
they
suggested
that
the
bear
probably
had
made
its
bed
of
decayed
wood
containing
foxfire
and
that
its
fur
was
covered
with
phosphorus
which
glowed
like
the
light
of
the
firefly
after
night
the
explosion
was
caused
by
a
pocket
of
natural
gas
which
became
ignited
when
polly
s
torch
fell
to
the
ground
by
the
side
of
the
fire
bear

on
the

of
nine
late
one
was
the
day
before
and
jim
were
seated
upon
the
extra
backlog
in
the
fireplace
ciphering
brent
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
in
a
rude
busily
knitting
while
she
rocked
the
baby
s
cradle
with
her
foot
and
softly
sang
the
refrain
of

laurie
for
a
lullaby
snow
had
begun
to
fall
at
noon
and
as
the
sun
sank
westward
the
north
wind
came
in
fitful
gusts
at
first
and
then
in
stronger
blasts
till
near
the
hour
of
four
when
boreas
burst
forth
in
the
biting
breath
of
the
storm
how
he
howled
and
screamed
down
the
chimney
at
his
enemy
the
fire
and
how
the
fire
crackled
and
spluttered
and
laughed
in
the
face
of
his
wrath
and
burned
all
the
brighter
because
of
his
raging
don
t
tell
me
that
a
fire
can
t
talk
a
fire
upon
a
happy
hearth
is
the
sweetest
conversationalist
on
earth
and
boreas
might
blow
his
lungs
out
ere
he
could
stop
the
words
of
cheer
and
health
and
love
and
happiness
which
the
fire
spoke
to
jim
and
balser
and
their
mother
in
the
gloaming
of
that
cold
and
stormy
day
put
on
more
wood
said
the
mother
in
a
whisper
wishing
not
to
awaken
the
baby
your
father
will
soon
be
home
from
brookville
and
we
must
make
the
house
good
and
warm
for
him
i
hope
he
will
come
early
it
would
be
dreadful
for
him
to
be
caught
far
away
from
home
in
such
a
storm
as
we
shall
have
brent
had
gone
to
brookville
several
days
before
with
wheat
and
pelts
for
market
and
was
expected
home
that
evening
balser
had
wanted
to
go
with
his
father
but
the
manly
little
fellow
had
given
up
his
wish
and
had
remained
at
home
that
he
might
take
care
of
his
mother
jim
and
the
baby
balser
quietly
placed
a
few
large
hickory
sticks
upon
the
fire
and
then
whispered
to
jim
let
s
go
out
and
feed
the
stock
and
fix
them
for
the
so
the
boys
went
to
the
barnyard
and
fed
the
horses
and
cows
and
drove
the
sheep
into
the
shed
and
carried
fodder
from
the
huge
stack
and
placed
it
against
the
north
sides
of
the
barn
and
shed
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
through
the
cracks
and
to
exclude
the
snow
when
the
stock
was
comfortable
cozy
and
warm
the
boys
milked
the
cows
and
brought
to
the
house
four
bucketfuls
of
steaming
milk
which
they
strained
and
left
in
the
kitchen
rather
than
in
the
that
it
might
not
freeze
over
night
darkness
came
on
rapidly
and
brent
grew
more
and
more
anxious
for
her
husband
s
return
fearing
that
he
might
be
late
she
postponed
supper
until
jim
s
ever
ready
appetite
began
to
cry
aloud
for
satisfaction
and
balser
intimated
that
he
too
might
be
induced
to
eat
so
their
mother
leisurely
went
to
work
to
get
supper
while
the
baby
was
left
sleeping
before
the
cheery
talkative
fire
in
the
front
room
a
fat
wild
turkey
roasted
to
a
delicious
brown
upon
the
spit
eggs
fried
in
the
sweetest
of
lard
milk
warm
from
the
cows
floating
in
maple
syrup
and
yellow
butter
sweet
potatoes
roasted
in
hot
ashes
and
a
great
slice
of
mince
pie
furnished
a
supper
that
makes
one
hungry
but
to
think
about
it
the
boys
however
were
hungry
without
thinking
and
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
see
that
supper
disappear
as
they
sat
at
supper
they
would
pause
in
their
eating
and
listen
attentively
to
every
noise
made
by
the
creaking
of
the
trees
or
the
falling
of
a
broken
twig
hoping
that
it
was
the
step
of
the
father
but
the
supper
was
finished
all
too
soon
and
the
storm
continued
to
increase
in
its
fury
the
snow
fell
thicker
and
the
cold
grew
fiercer
still
brent
did
not
come
brent
said
nothing
but
as
the
hours
flew
by
her
anxious
heart
imparted
its
trouble
to
balser
and
he
began
to
fear
for
his
father
s
safety
the
little
clock
upon
the
rude
shelf
above
the
fireplace
hoarsely
and
slowly
drawled
out
the
hour
of
seven
then
eight
and
then
nine
that
was
very
late
for
the
brent
family
to
be
out
of
bed
and
nothing
short
of
the
anxiety
they
felt
could
have
kept
them
awake
jim
of
course
had
long
since
fallen
asleep
and
he
lay
upon
a
soft
bearskin
in
front
of
the
fire
wholly
unconscious
of
storms
or
troubles
of
any
sort
brent
sat
watching
and
waiting
while
jim
and
the
baby
slept
and
to
her
anxious
heart
it
seemed
that
the
seconds
lengthened
into
minutes
and
the
minutes
into
hours
by
reason
of
her
loneliness
while
she
rocked
beside
the
baby
s
cradle
balser
was
sitting
in
his
favourite
place
upon
the
backlog
next
to
the
fire
he
had
been
reading
or
trying
to
read
the
pilgrim
s
progress
but
visions
of
his
father
and
of
the
team
lost
in
the
trackless
forest
facing
death
by
freezing
to
say
nothing
of
wolves
that
prowled
the
woods
in
packs
of
hundreds
upon
such
a
night
as
that
continually
came
between
his
eyes
and
the
page
and
blurred
the
words
until
they
held
no
meaning
gradually
drowsiness
stole
over
him
too
and
just
as
the
clock
began
deliberately
to
strike
the
hour
of
nine
his
head
fell
back
into
a
little
corner
made
by
projecting
logs
in
the
wall
of
the
fireplace
and
like
jim
he
forgot
his
troubles
as
he
slept
balser
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
been
sleeping
when
the
neighing
of
a
horse
was
heard
brent
hastened
to
the
door
but
when
she
opened
it
instead
of
her
husband
she
found
one
of
the
horses
an
intelligent
animal
named
buck
standing
near
the
house
balser
had
heard
her
call
and
he
quickly
ran
out
of
doors
and
went
to
the
horse
the
harness
was
broken
and
dragging
upon
the
ground
behind
the
horse
were
small
portions
of
the
wreck
of
the
wagon
poor
buck
s
flank
was
red
with
blood
and
his
legs
showed
all
too
plainly
the
marks
of
deadly
conflict
with
a
savage
hungry
foe
the
wreck
of
the
wagon
the
broken
harness
and
the
wounds
upon
the
horse
told
eloquently
as
if
spoken
in
words
the
story
of
the
night
wolves
had
attacked
balser
s
father
and
buck
had
come
home
to
give
the
alarm
illustration
balser
ran
quickly
to
the
fire
pile
upon
the
hill
and
kindled
it
for
the
purpose
of
calling
help
from
the
neighbours
then
he
went
back
to
the
house
and
took
down
his
gun
he
tied
a
bundle
of
torches
over
his
shoulder
lighted
one
and
started
out
in
the
blinding
freezing
storm
to
help
his
father
if
possible
he
followed
the
tracks
of
the
horse
which
with
the
aid
of
his
torch
were
easily
discernible
in
the
deep
snow
and
soon
he
was
far
into
the
forest
intent
upon
his
mission
of
rescue
after
the
boy
had
travelled
for
an
hour
he
heard
the
howling
of
wolves
and
hastened
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
feeling
in
his
heart
that
he
would
find
his
father
surrounded
by
a
ferocious
pack
he
hurried
forward
as
rapidly
as
he
could
run
and
his
worst
fears
were
realized
soon
he
reached
the
top
of
a
hill
overlooking
a
narrow
ravine
which
lay
to
the
eastward
the
moon
had
risen
and
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
the
wind
was
blowing
a
fiercer
gale
than
ever
and
had
broken
rifts
in
the
black
bank
of
so
that
gleams
of
the
moon
now
and
then
enabled
balser
s
vision
to
penetrate
the
darkness
upon
looking
down
into
the
ravine
he
beheld
his
father
standing
in
the
wagon
holding
in
his
hand
a
singletree
which
he
used
as
a
weapon
of
defence
the
wolves
jumped
upon
the
wagon
in
twos
and
threes
and
when
beaten
off
by
brent
would
crowd
around
the
wheels
and
howl
to
get
their
courage
up
and
renew
the
attack
illustration
brent
saw
the
boy
starting
down
the
hill
toward
the
wagon
and
motioned
to
him
to
go
back
balser
quickly
perceived
that
it
would
be
worse
than
madness
to
go
to
his
father
the
wolves
would
at
once
turn
their
attack
upon
him
and
his
father
would
be
compelled
to
abandon
his
advantageous
position
in
the
wagon
and
go
to
his
relief
in
which
case
both
father
and
son
would
be
lost
should
balser
fire
into
the
pack
of
wolves
from
where
he
stood
he
would
bring
upon
himself
and
his
father
the
same
disaster
he
felt
his
helplessness
grievously
but
his
quick
wit
came
to
his
assistance
he
looked
about
him
for
a
tree
which
he
could
climb
and
soon
found
one
at
first
he
hesitated
to
make
use
of
the
tree
for
it
was
dead
and
apparently
rotten
but
there
was
none
other
at
hand
so
he
hastily
climbed
up
and
seated
himself
firmly
upon
a
limb
which
seemed
strong
enough
to
sustain
his
weight
balser
was
now
safe
from
the
wolves
and
at
a
distance
of
not
more
than
twenty
yards
from
his
father
there
he
waited
until
the
clouds
for
a
moment
permitted
the
full
light
of
the
moon
to
rest
upon
the
scene
and
then
he
took
deliberate
aim
and
fired
into
the
pack
of
howling
wolves
a
sharp
yelp
answered
his
shot
and
then
a
black
seething
mass
of
growling
fighting
snapping
beasts
fell
upon
the
carcass
of
the
wolf
that
balser
s
shot
had
killed
and
almost
instantly
they
devoured
their
unfortunate
companion
balser
felt
that
if
he
could
kill
enough
wolves
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
living
ones
they
would
abandon
their
attack
upon
his
father
for
wolves
like
cowardly
men
are
brave
only
in
desperation
they
will
attack
neither
man
nor
animal
except
when
driven
to
do
so
by
hunger
after
balser
had
killed
the
wolf
clouds
obscured
the
moon
before
he
could
make
another
shot
he
feared
to
fire
in
the
dark
lest
he
might
kill
his
father
so
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
light
which
did
not
come
meanwhile
the
dead
wolf
having
been
devoured
the
pack
again
turned
upon
brent
and
balser
could
hear
his
father
s
voice
and
the
clanking
of
the
iron
upon
the
singletree
as
he
struck
at
the
wolves
to
ward
them
off
it
seemed
to
balser
that
the
moon
had
gone
under
the
clouds
never
to
appear
again
brent
continually
called
loudly
to
the
wolves
for
the
human
voice
is
an
awesome
sound
even
to
the
fiercest
animals
to
balser
the
tone
of
his
father
s
voice
mingled
with
the
howling
of
wolves
was
a
note
of
desperation
that
almost
drove
him
frantic
the
wind
increased
in
fury
every
moment
and
balser
felt
the
cold
piercing
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
he
had
waited
it
seemed
to
him
hours
for
the
light
of
the
moon
again
to
shine
but
the
clouds
appeared
to
grow
deeper
and
the
darkness
more
dense
while
balser
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
watch
the
conflict
at
the
wagon
he
heard
a
noise
at
the
root
of
the
tree
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
and
looking
down
he
discovered
a
black
monster
standing
quietly
beneath
him
it
was
a
bear
that
had
been
attracted
to
the
scene
of
battle
by
the
noise
balser
at
once
thought
could
i
kill
this
huge
bear
his
great
carcass
certainly
would
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
wolves
that
surround
my
accordingly
he
lowered
the
point
of
his
gun
and
taking
as
good
aim
as
the
darkness
would
permit
he
fired
upon
the
bear
the
bear
gave
forth
a
frightful
growl
of
rage
and
pain
and
as
it
did
so
its
companion
a
beast
of
enormous
size
came
running
up
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
assistance
illustration
imagine
his
consternation
when
he
recognized
the
forms
of
liney
fox
and
her
brother
balser
hastily
reloaded
his
gun
and
prepared
to
shoot
the
other
bear
this
he
soon
did
and
while
the
wolves
howled
about
his
father
the
two
wounded
bears
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
made
night
hideous
with
their
ravings
such
a
frightful
bedlam
of
noises
had
never
before
been
heard
balser
was
again
loading
his
gun
hoping
to
finish
the
bears
when
he
saw
two
lighted
torches
approaching
along
the
path
over
which
he
had
just
come
and
as
they
came
into
view
imagine
his
consternation
when
he
recognized
the
forms
of
liney
fox
and
her
brother
tom
tom
carried
his
father
s
gun
for
fox
had
gone
to
brookville
and
liney
in
addition
to
her
torch
carried
tom
s
hatchet
liney
and
tom
were
approaching
rapidly
and
balser
called
out
to
them
to
stop
they
did
not
hear
him
or
did
not
heed
him
but
continued
to
go
forward
to
their
death
the
bears
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
were
wounded
and
would
be
more
dangerous
than
even
the
pack
of
wolves
howling
at
the
wagon
go
back
go
back
cried
balser
desperately
or
you
ll
be
killed
two
wounded
bears
are
at
the
root
of
the
tree

in
and
a
hundred
wolves
are
howling
in
the
hollow
just
below
me
run
for
your
lives
run
you
ll
be
torn
in
pieces
if
you
come
the
boy
and
girl
did
not
stop
but
continued
to
walk
rapidly
toward
the
spot
from
which
they
had
heard
balser
call
the
clouds
had
drifted
away
from
the
moon
and
now
that
the
light
was
of
little
use
to
he
was
intent
upon
saving
liney
and
was
plenty
of
it
illustration
he
fell
a
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
and
lay
half
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
growling
of
the
bears
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
wolves
they
were
wavering
in
their
attack
upon
brent
and
evidently
had
half
a
notion
to
fall
upon
the
bears
that
balser
had
wounded
meantime
liney
and
tom
continued
to
approach
and
their
torches
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
frightened
the
animals
away
attracted
the
attention
of
the
bears
and
the
wolves
and
drew
the
beasts
upon
them
they
were
now
within
a
few
yards
of
certain
death
and
again
balser
in
agony
cried
out
go
back
liney
go
back
run
for
your
lives
in
his
eagerness
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
a
step
or
two
out
upon
the
rotten
limb
on
which
he
had
been
seated
as
he
called
to
liney
and
tom
and
motioned
to
them
frantically
to
go
back
the
limb
upon
which
he
was
standing
broke
and
he
fell
a
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
to
the
ground
and
lay
half
stunned
between
the
two
wounded
bears
just
as
balser
fell
liney
and
tom
came
up
to
the
rotten
tree
and
at
the
same
time
the
pack
of
wolves
abandoned
their
attack
upon
brent
and
rushed
like
a
herd
of
howling
demons
upon
the
three
helpless
children
one
of
the
bears
immediately
seized
balser
and
the
other
one
struck
liney
to
the
ground
by
the
light
of
the
torches
brent
saw
all
that
had
happened
and
when
the
wolves
abandoned
their
attack
upon
him
he
hurried
forward
to
rescue
balser
liney
and
tom
although
in
so
doing
he
was
going
to
meet
his
death
in
a
few
seconds
brent
was
in
the
midst
of
the
terrible
fight
and
a
dozen
wolves
sprang
upon
him
tom
s
gun
was
useless
so
he
snatched
the
hatchet
from
liney
who
was
lying
prostrate
under
one
of
the
bears
and
tried
to
rescue
her
from
its
jaws
had
he
done
so
however
it
would
have
been
only
to
save
her
for
the
wolves
but
his
attempt
to
rescue
liney
was
quickly
brought
to
an
end
the
wolves
sprang
upon
tom
and
soon
he
too
was
upon
the
ground
the
resinous
torches
which
had
fallen
from
the
hands
of
tom
and
liney
continued
to
burn
and
cast
a
lurid
light
upon
the
terrible
scene
consciousness
soon
returned
to
balser
and
he
saw
with
horror
the
fate
that
was
in
store
for
his
father
his
friends
and
himself
despair
took
possession
of
his
soul
and
he
knew
that
the
lamp
of
life
would
soon
be
black
in
all
of
them
forever
while
his
father
and
tom
lay
upon
the
ground
at
the
mercy
of
the
wolves
and
while
liney
was
lying
within
arm
s
reach
of
him
in
the
jaws
of
the
wounded
bear
and
he
utterly
helpless
to
save
the
girl
of
whom
he
was
so
fond
balser
s
mother
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
and
said
balser
your
father
is
balser
sprang
to
his
feet
looked
dazed
for
a
moment
and
then
ran
half
weeping
half
laughing
into
his
father
s
arms
just
as
the
sleepy
little
clock
had
finished
striking
nine
chapter
x
a
castle
on
the
brandywine
christmas
morning
the
boys
awakened
early
and
crept
from
beneath
their
warm
bearskins
in
eager
anticipation
of
gifts
from
santa
claus
of
course
they
had
long
before
learned
who
santa
claus
was
but
they
loved
the
story
and
in
the
wisdom
of
their
innocence
clung
to
an
illusion
which
brought
them
happiness
the
sun
had
risen
upon
a
scene
such
as
winter
only
can
produce
surely
aladdin
had
come
to
blue
river
upon
the
wings
of
the
christmas
storm
had
rubbed
his
lamp
and
lo
the
humble
cabin
was
in
the
heart
of
a
fairyland
such
as
was
never
conceived
by
the
mind
of
a
genie
snow
lay
upon
the
ground
like
a
soft
carpet
of
white
velvet
ten
inches
thick
the
boughs
of
the
trees
were
festooned
with
a
foliage
that
spring
can
not
rival
even
the
locust
trees
which
in
their
pride
of
blossom
cry
out
in
june
time
for
our
admiration
seemed
to
say
see
what
we
can
do
in
winter
and
the
sycamore
and
beech
drooped
their
branches
as
if
to
call
attention
to
their
winter
flowers
given
by
that
rarest
of
artists
jack
frost
the
boys
quickly
donned
their
heavy
buckskin
clothing
and
moccasins
and
climbed
down
the
pole
to
the
room
where
their
father
and
mother
were
sleeping
jim
awakened
his
parents
with
a
cry
of
christmas
gift
but
balser
s
attention
was
attracted
to
a
barrel
standing
by
the
fireplace
which
his
father
had
brought
from
brookville
and
into
which
the
boys
had
not
been
permitted
to
look
the
night
before
balser
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
of
what
the
barrel
contained
and
his
delight
knew
no
bounds
when
he
found
as
he
had
hoped
that
it
was
filled
with
steel
traps
of
the
size
used
to
catch
beavers
coons
and
foxes
since
he
had
owned
a
gun
balser
s
great
desire
had
been
to
possess
a
number
of
traps
as
i
have
already
told
you
the
pelts
of
animals
taken
in
winter
are
of
great
value
and
our
little
hero
longed
to
begin
life
on
his
own
account
as
a
hunter
and
trapper
i
might
tell
you
of
the
joyous
christmas
morning
in
the
humble
cabin
when
the
gifts
which
brent
had
brought
from
brookville
were
distributed
i
might
tell
you
of
the
new
gown
for
mother
of
the
bright
red
mufflers
of
the
shoes
for
sunday
wear
and
the
store
caps
for
the
boys
to
be
used
upon
holiday
occasions
i
might
tell
you
of
the
candies
and
nuts
and
of
the
rarest
of
all
the
gifts
an
orange
for
each
member
of
the
family
for
that
fruit
had
never
before
been
seen
upon
blue
river
but
i
must
take
you
to
the
castle
on
brandywine
you
may
wonder
how
there
came
to
be
a
castle
in
the
wilderness
on
brandywine
but
i
am
sure
when
you
learn
about
it
you
will
declare
that
it
was
fairer
than
any
castle
ever
built
of
mortar
and
stone
and
that
the
adventures
which
befell
our
little
heroes
were
as
glorious
as
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
spurred
and
belted
knight
immediately
after
breakfast
when
the
chores
had
all
been
finished
balser
and
jim
started
down
the
river
to
visit
liney
and
tom
balser
carried
with
him
two
christmas
presents
for
his
steel
trap
for
tom
and
the
orange
which
his
father
had
brought
him
from
brookville
for
liney
i
might
also
tell
you
of
tom
s
delight
when
he
received
the
trap
and
of
liney
s
smile
of
pleasure
worth
all
the
oranges
in
the
world
when
she
received
her
present
and
i
might
fell
you
how
she
divided
the
orange
into
pieces
and
gave
one
to
each
of
the
family
and
how
after
it
had
all
been
eaten
tears
came
to
her
bright
eyes
when
she
learned
that
balser
had
not
tasted
the
fruit
i
might
tell
you
much
more
that
would
be
interesting
and
show
you
how
good
and
true
and
gentle
were
these
honest
simple
folk
but
i
must
drop
it
all
and
begin
my
story
balser
told
tom
about
the
traps
and
a
trapping
expedition
was
quickly
agreed
upon
between
the
boys
the
next
day
tom
went
to
visit
balser
and
for
three
or
four
days
the
boys
were
busily
engaged
in
making
two
sleds
upon
which
to
carry
provisions
for
their
campaign
the
sleds
when
finished
were
each
about
two
feet
broad
and
six
feet
long
they
were
made
of
elm
and
were
very
strong
and
were
so
light
that
when
loaded
the
boys
could
easily
draw
them
over
the
snow
by
the
time
the
sleds
were
finished
the
snow
was
hard
and
everything
was
ready
for
the
moving
of
the
expedition
first
the
traps
were
packed
then
provisions
consisting
of
sweet
potatoes
a
great
lump
of
maple
sugar
a
dozen
loaves
of
white
bread
two
or
three
gourds
full
of
butter
a
side
of
bacon
a
bag
of
meal
a
large
piece
of
bear
meat
for
the
dogs
and
a
number
of
other
articles
and
simple
utensils
such
as
the
boys
would
need
in
cooking
were
loaded
upon
the
sleds
they
took
with
them
no
meat
other
than
bacon
and
the
bear
meat
for
the
dogs
for
they
knew
they
could
make
traps
from
the
boughs
of
trees
in
which
they
could
catch
quail
and
pheasants
and
were
sure
to
be
able
in
an
hour
s
hunting
to
provide
enough
venison
to
supply
their
wants
for
a
much
longer
time
than
they
would
remain
in
camp
there
were
also
wild
turkeys
to
be
killed
and
fish
to
be
caught
through
openings
which
the
boys
would
make
in
the
ice
of
the
creek
over
the
loaded
sleds
they
spread
woolly
bearskins
to
be
used
for
beds
and
covering
during
the
cold
nights
and
they
also
took
with
them
a
number
of
tanned
deerskins
with
which
to
carpet
the
floor
of
their
castle
and
to
close
its
doors
and
windows
tom
took
with
him
his
wonderful
hatchet
an
axe
and
his
father
s
rifle
axe
hatchets
and
knives
had
been
sharpened
and
bullets
had
been
moulded
in
such
vast
numbers
that
one
would
have
thought
the
boys
were
going
to
war
powder
horns
were
filled
and
a
can
of
that
precious
article
was
placed
carefully
upon
each
of
the
sleds
bright
and
early
one
morning
balser
tom
and
jim
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
tige
and
prince
crossed
blue
river
and
started
in
a
northwestern
direction
toward
a
point
on
brandywine
where
a
number
of
beaver
dams
were
known
to
exist
ten
miles
distant
from
the
brent
cabin
illustration
en
route
for
the
castle
tom
and
tige
drew
one
of
the
sleds
and
balser
and
prince
drew
the
other
during
the
first
part
of
the
trip
jim
would
now
and
then
lend
a
helping
hand
but
toward
the
latter
end
of
the
journey
he
said
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
ride
upon
one
of
the
sleds
to
keep
the
load
from
falling
off
balser
and
tom
however
did
not
agree
with
him
nor
did
the
dogs
so
jim
walked
behind
and
grumbled
and
had
his
grumbling
for
his
pains
as
usually
is
the
case
with
grumblers
illustration
two
or
three
hours
before
sunset
the
boys
reached
brandywine
a
babbling
little
creek
in
springtime
winding
its
crooked
rippling
way
through
overhanging
boughs
of
water
elm
sycamore
and
willows
but
at
the
time
of
our
heroes
expedition
frozen
over
with
the
mail
of
winter
it
is
in
small
creeks
such
as
brandywine
that
beavers
love
to
make
their
dams
our
little
caravan
upon
reaching
brandywine
at
once
took
to
the
ice
and
started
along
its
winding
course
jim
had
grown
tired
i
don
t
believe
you
fellows
know
where
you
re
going
said
he
i
don
t
see
any
place
to
you
ll
see
it
pretty
quickly
said
balser
and
when
they
turned
a
bend
in
the
creek
they
beheld
a
huge
sycamore
springing
from
a
little
valley
that
led
down
to
the
water
s
edge
there
s
our
home
said
balser
the
sycamore
was
hollow
and
at
its
roots
was
an
opening
for
a
doorway
upon
beholding
the
tree
jim
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
was
for
entering
their
new
home
at
once
but
balser
held
him
back
and
sent
in
the
dogs
as
an
exploring
advance
guard
soon
the
dogs
came
out
and
informed
the
boys
that
everything
within
the
tree
was
all
right
and
balser
and
tom
and
jim
stooped
low
and
entered
upon
the
possession
of
their
castle
on
brandywine
the
first
task
was
to
sweep
out
the
dust
and
dry
leaves
this
the
boys
did
with
bundles
of
twigs
rudely
fashioned
into
brooms
the
dry
leaves
and
small
tufts
of
black
hair
gave
evidence
all
too
strongly
that
the
castle
which
the
boys
had
captured
was
the
home
of
some
baron
bear
who
had
incautiously
left
his
stronghold
unguarded
jim
spoke
of
this
fact
with
unpleasant
emphasis
and
was
ready
to
bet
that
the
bear
would
come
back
when
they
were
all
asleep
and
would
take
possession
of
his
castle
and
devour
the
intruders
will
you
bet
said
tom
i
didn
t
say
i
would
bet
anything
i
just
said
i
d
bet
and
you
ll
see
i
m
right
returned
jim
balser
and
tom
well
knew
that
jim
s
prophecy
might
easily
come
true
but
they
had
faith
in
the
watchfulness
of
their
sentinels
tige
and
prince
and
the
moon
being
at
its
full
they
hoped
rather
than
feared
that
his
bearship
might
return
and
were
confident
that
in
case
he
did
his
danger
would
be
greater
than
theirs
after
the
castle
floor
had
been
carefully
swept
the
boys
carried
in
the
deerskins
and
spread
them
on
the
ground
for
a
carpet
the
bearskins
were
then
taken
in
and
the
beds
were
made
traps
guns
and
provisions
were
stored
away
and
the
sleds
were
drawn
around
to
one
side
of
the
door
and
placed
leaning
against
the
tree
the
boys
were
hungry
and
jim
insisted
that
supper
should
be
prepared
at
once
but
tom
having
made
several
trips
around
the
tree
remarked
mysteriously
that
he
had
a
plan
of
his
own
he
said
there
was
a
great
deal
of
work
to
be
done
before
sundown
and
that
supper
could
be
eaten
after
dark
when
they
could
not
work
tom
was
right
for
the
night
gave
promise
of
bitter
cold
limpy
did
not
tell
his
plans
at
once
but
soon
they
were
developed
the
hollow
in
the
tree
in
which
the
boys
had
made
their
home
was
almost
circular
in
form
it
was
at
least
ten
or
eleven
feet
in
diameter
and
extended
up
into
the
tree
twenty
or
thirty
feet
springing
from
the
same
root
and
a
part
of
the
parent
tree
grew
two
large
sprouts
or
branches
which
at
a
little
distance
looked
like
separate
trees
they
were
however
each
connected
with
the
larger
tree
and
the
three
formed
one
what
on
earth
are
you
pounding
at
that
tree
for
asked
jim
while
tom
was
striking
one
of
the
smaller
trees
with
the
butt
end
of
the
hatchet
and
listening
intently
as
if
he
expected
to
hear
a
response
tom
did
not
reply
to
jim
but
in
a
moment
entered
the
main
tree
with
axe
in
hand
and
soon
balser
and
jim
heard
him
chopping
the
two
boys
at
once
followed
tom
to
learn
what
their
eccentric
companion
was
doing
tom
did
not
respond
to
their
questions
but
after
he
had
chopped
vigorously
for
a
few
minutes
the
result
of
his
work
gave
them
an
answer
for
he
soon
cut
an
opening
into
the
smaller
tree
which
was
also
hollow
tom
had
discovered
the
hollow
by
striking
the
tree
with
his
hatchet
in
fact
tom
was
a
genius
after
his
own
peculiar
pattern
the
newly
discovered
hollow
proved
to
be
three
or
four
feet
in
diameter
and
like
that
in
the
larger
tree
extended
to
a
considerable
height
after
tom
had
made
the
opening
between
the
trees
he
sat
upon
the
ground
and
with
his
hatchet
hewed
it
to
an
oval
shape
two
feet
high
and
two
feet
broad
jim
could
not
imagine
why
tom
had
taken
so
much
trouble
to
add
another
room
to
their
house
which
was
already
large
enough
but
when
tom
having
finished
the
opening
upon
the
inside
went
out
and
began
to
climb
the
smaller
tree
with
the
help
of
a
few
branches
the
youngest
member
of
the
expedition
became
fully
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
the
second
in
command
was
out
of
his
head
entirely
when
tom
having
climbed
to
a
height
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
began
to
chop
with
his
hatchet
jim
remarked
in
most
emphatic
language
that
he
thought
a
fellow
who
would
chop
at
a
sycamore
tree
just
for
the
sake
of
making
chips
when
he
might
be
eating
his
supper
was
too
big
a
fool
to
tom
did
not
respond
to
jim
s
sarcasm
but
persevered
in
his
chopping
until
he
had
made
an
opening
at
the
point
to
which
he
had
climbed
balser
had
quickly
guessed
the
object
of
tom
s
mighty
labors
but
he
did
not
enlighten
jim
he
had
gone
to
other
work
and
by
the
time
tom
had
made
the
opening
from
the
outside
of
the
smaller
tree
had
collected
a
pile
of
firewood
and
had
carried
several
loads
of
it
into
the
castle
then
tom
came
down
and
jim
quickly
followed
him
into
the
large
tree
for
by
that
time
his
mysterious
movements
were
full
of
interest
to
the
little
fellow
now
what
do
you
suppose
was
tom
s
object
in
wasting
so
much
time
and
energy
with
his
axe
and
hatchet
a
fireplace
you
will
at
once
understand
that
the
opening
which
tom
had
cut
in
the
tree
at
the
height
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
chimney
through
which
the
smoke
might
escape
the
boys
kindled
a
fire
and
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
cheery
blaze
in
their
fireplace
that
lighted
up
the
room
and
made
everything
look
just
like
home
jim
said
then
jim
went
outside
and
gave
a
great
hurrah
of
delight
when
he
saw
the
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
that
ingenious
tom
had
made
with
his
hatchet
illustration
the
castle
on
the
brandywine
jim
watched
the
smoke
for
a
few
moments
and
then
walked
around
the
tree
to
survey
the
premises
the
result
of
his
survey
was
the
discovery
of
a
hollow
in
the
third
tree
of
their
castle
and
when
he
informed
balser
and
tom
of
the
important
fact
it
was
agreed
that
the
room
which
jim
had
found
should
be
prepared
for
tige
and
prince
the
dogs
were
not
fastidious
and
a
was
soon
made
for
them
entirely
to
their
satisfaction
meantime
the
fire
was
blazing
and
crackling
in
the
fireplace
and
the
boys
began
to
prepare
supper
they
had
not
had
time
to
kill
game
so
they
fried
a
few
pieces
of
bacon
and
a
dozen
eggs
of
which
they
had
brought
a
good
supply
and
roasted
a
few
sweet
potatoes
in
the
ashes
then
they
made
an
opening
in
the
ice
from
which
they
drew
a
bucketful
of
sparkling
ice
water
and
when
all
was
ready
they
sat
down
to
supper
served
with
the
rarest
of
all
dressings
appetite
sauce
and
at
least
one
of
the
party
jim
was
happy
as
a
boy
could
be
the
dogs
then
received
their
supper
of
bear
meat
the
members
of
the
expedition
from
the
commanding
officer
balser
to
the
high
privates
tige
and
prince
were
very
tired
after
their
hard
day
s
work
and
when
tom
and
balser
showed
the
dogs
their
they
curled
up
close
to
each
other
and
soon
were
in
the
land
of
dog
dreams
by
the
time
supper
was
finished
night
had
fallen
and
while
tom
and
balser
were
engaged
in
stretching
a
deerskin
across
the
door
to
exclude
the
cold
air
jim
crept
between
the
bearskins
and
soon
was
sound
asleep
dreaming
no
doubt
of
suppers
and
dinners
and
breakfasts
and
scolding
in
his
dreams
like
the
veritable
little
grumbler
that
he
was
a
great
bed
of
embers
had
accumulated
in
the
fireplace
and
upon
them
balser
placed
a
hickory
knot
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
fire
till
morning
and
then
he
covered
the
fire
with
ashes
after
all
was
ready
balser
and
tom
crept
in
between
the
bearskins
and
lying
one
on
each
side
of
jim
lost
no
time
in
making
a
rapid
happy
journey
to
the
land
of
nod
tom
slept
next
to
the
wall
next
to
tom
lay
jim
and
next
to
jim
was
balser
the
boys
were
lying
with
their
feet
to
the
fire
and
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
was
the
doorway
closed
by
the
deerskin
of
which
i
have
already
told
you
of
course
they
went
to
bed
all
standing
as
sailors
say
when
they
lie
down
to
sleep
with
their
clothing
on
for
the
weather
was
cold
and
the
buckskin
clothing
and
moccasins
were
soft
and
pleasant
to
sleep
in
and
would
materially
assist
the
bearskins
in
keeping
the
boys
warm
it
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
in
the
last
flickering
light
of
the
smouldering
fire
to
see
the
three
boys
huddled
closely
together
covered
by
the
bearskins
i
have
no
doubt
had
you
seen
them
upon
that
night
they
would
have
appeared
to
you
like
a
sleeping
bear
in
fact
before
the
night
was
over
they
did
appear
i
must
not
go
ahead
of
my
story
the
hours
of
darkness
sped
like
moments
to
the
sleeping
boys
the
smouldering
coals
in
the
fireplace
were
black
and
lustreless
the
night
wind
softly
moaned
through
the
branches
of
the
sycamore
and
sighed
as
it
swept
the
bare
limbs
of
the
willows
and
the
rustling
tops
of
the
underbrush
jack
frost
was
silently
at
work
and
the
cold
clear
air
seemed
to
glitter
in
the
moonlight
it
was
an
hour
past
midnight
had
the
boys
been
awake
and
listening
or
had
tige
and
prince
been
attending
to
their
duties
as
sentinels
they
would
have
heard
a
crisp
noise
of
footsteps
as
the
icy
surface
of
the
snow
cracked
and
as
dead
twigs
broke
beneath
a
heavy
weight
ah
could
the
boys
but
awaken
could
the
dogs
be
aroused
but
for
one
instant
from
their
deep
lethargy
of
slumber
balser
tom
jim
tige
prince
awaken
awaken
on
comes
the
heavy
footfall
cautiously
as
it
approaches
the
castle
a
few
hurried
steps
are
taken
and
the
black
awkward
form
lifts
his
head
and
sniffs
the
air
for
signs
of
danger
the
baron
has
returned
to
claim
his
own
and
jim
s
prophecy
at
least
in
part
has
come
true
the
tracks
upon
the
snow
left
by
the
boys
and
dogs
and
the
sleds
leaning
against
the
tree
excite
the
bear
s
suspicion
and
he
stands
like
a
statue
for
five
minutes
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
not
he
shall
enter
his
old
domain
the
memory
of
his
cozy
home
tempts
him
and
he
cautiously
walks
to
the
doorway
of
his
house
the
deerskin
stretched
across
the
opening
surprises
him
and
he
carefully
examines
it
with
the
aid
of
his
chief
counsellor
his
nose
then
he
thrusts
it
aside
with
his
head
and
enters
he
sees
the
boys
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
tree
and
doubtless
fancies
that
his
mate
has
gotten
home
before
him
so
he
complacently
lies
down
beside
the
bearskins
and
soon
he
too
is
in
the
land
of
bear
dreams
when
a
bear
sleeps
he
snores
and
the
first
loud
snort
from
the
baron
s
nostrils
aroused
balser
at
first
balser
s
mind
was
in
confusion
and
he
thought
that
he
was
at
home
in
a
moment
however
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
waited
in
the
darkness
for
a
repetition
of
the
sound
that
had
awakened
him
soon
it
came
again
and
balser
in
his
drowsiness
fancied
that
tom
had
changed
his
place
and
was
lying
beside
him
though
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
heard
such
sounds
proceed
from
limpy
s
nose
so
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
at
once
was
undeceived
for
he
touched
the
bear
and
at
last
balser
was
awake
the
boy
s
hair
seemed
to
stand
erect
upon
his
head
and
his
blood
grew
cold
in
his
veins
as
he
realized
the
terrible
situation
all
was
darkness
the
guns
hatchets
and
knives
were
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
tree
and
to
reach
them
or
to
reach
the
doorway
balser
would
have
to
climb
over
the
bear
cold
as
the
night
was
perspiration
sprang
from
every
pore
of
his
skin
and
terror
took
possession
of
him
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
it
seemed
a
long
time
that
he
lay
there
but
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
few
seconds
until
the
bear
gave
forth
another
snort
and
tom
raised
up
from
his
side
of
the
bed
and
said
balser
for
goodness
sake
stop
snoring
the
noise
you
make
would
bring
a
dead
man
to
tom
s
voice
aroused
the
bear
and
it
immediately
rose
upon
its
haunches
with
a
deep
growl
that
seemed
to
shake
the
tree
then
jim
awakened
and
began
to
scream
at
the
same
instant
tige
and
prince
entered
the
tree
and
a
fight
at
once
ensued
between
the
bear
and
dogs
the
bear
was
as
badly
frightened
as
the
boys
and
when
it
and
the
dogs
ran
about
the
room
the
boys
were
thrown
to
the
ground
and
trampled
upon
the
beast
in
his
desperate
effort
to
escape
ran
into
the
fireplace
and
scattered
the
coals
and
ashes
as
he
could
not
escape
through
the
fireplace
he
backed
into
the
room
and
again
made
the
rounds
of
the
tree
with
the
dogs
at
his
heels
again
the
boys
were
knocked
about
as
if
they
were
ninepins
they
made
an
effort
to
reach
the
door
but
all
i
have
told
you
about
took
place
so
quickly
and
the
darkness
was
so
intense
that
they
failed
to
escape
meantime
the
fight
between
the
dogs
and
the
bear
went
on
furiously
and
the
barking
yelping
growling
and
snarling
made
a
noise
that
was
deafening
balser
lifted
jim
to
his
arms
and
tried
to
save
him
from
injury
but
his
efforts
were
of
small
avail
for
with
each
plunge
of
the
bear
the
boys
were
thrown
to
the
ground
or
dashed
against
the
tree
until
it
seemed
that
there
was
not
a
spot
upon
their
bodies
that
was
not
bruised
and
scratched
at
last
after
a
minute
or
two
of
awful
struggle
and
minute
or
two
that
seemed
hours
to
the
bear
made
his
exit
through
the
door
followed
closely
by
tige
and
prince
who
clung
to
him
with
a
persistency
not
to
be
shaken
off
you
may
be
sure
that
the
boys
lost
no
time
in
making
their
exit
also
their
first
thoughts
of
course
were
of
each
other
and
when
balser
learned
that
jim
and
tom
had
received
no
serious
injury
he
quickly
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
whence
the
bear
and
dogs
had
gone
and
saw
them
at
a
point
in
the
bend
of
the
creek
not
fifty
yards
away
the
bear
had
come
to
bay
and
the
dogs
were
in
front
of
him
at
a
safe
distance
barking
furiously
then
balser
s
courage
returned
and
he
hastily
went
into
the
tree
brought
out
his
carbine
and
hurried
toward
the
scene
of
conflict
the
moon
was
at
its
full
and
the
snow
upon
the
trees
and
upon
the
ground
helped
to
make
the
night
almost
as
light
as
day
the
bear
was
sitting
erect
upon
his
haunches
hurling
defiant
growls
at
the
dogs
and
when
balser
approached
him
the
brute
presented
his
breast
as
a
fair
mark
tom
also
fetched
his
gun
and
followed
closely
at
balser
s
heels
the
attention
of
the
bear
was
so
occupied
with
the
dogs
that
he
gave
no
heed
to
the
boys
and
they
easily
approached
him
to
within
a
distance
of
five
or
six
yards
tom
and
balser
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
with
their
guns
ready
to
fire
and
balser
said
tom
you
shoot
first
i
ll
watch
carefully
and
hold
my
fire
until
the
bear
makes
a
rush
should
you
fail
to
kill
much
to
balser
s
surprise
tom
quickly
and
fearlessly
took
three
or
four
steps
toward
the
bear
and
when
he
lifted
his
father
s
long
gun
to
fire
the
end
of
it
was
within
three
yards
of
the
bear
s
breast
illustration
balser
hesitated
to
fire
fearing
that
he
might
kill
tom
or
one
of
the
balser
held
his
ground
much
frightened
at
tom
s
reckless
bravery
but
did
not
dare
to
speak
when
tom
fired
the
bear
gave
forth
a
fearful
growl
and
sprang
like
a
wildcat
right
upon
the
boy
tom
fell
to
the
ground
upon
his
back
and
the
bear
stood
over
him
the
dogs
quickly
made
an
attack
and
balser
hesitated
to
fire
fearing
that
he
might
kill
tom
or
one
of
the
dogs
then
came
jim
who
rushed
past
balser
toward
tom
and
the
bear
and
if
jim
s
courage
had
ever
before
been
doubted
all
such
doubts
were
upon
that
night
removed
forever
the
little
fellow
carried
in
his
hand
tom
s
hatchet
and
without
fear
or
hesitancy
he
ran
to
the
bear
and
began
to
strike
him
with
all
his
little
might
meantime
poor
prostrate
tom
was
crying
piteously
for
help
and
now
that
jim
was
added
to
the
group
it
seemed
impossible
for
balser
to
fire
at
the
bear
but
no
time
was
to
be
lost
if
balser
did
not
shoot
tom
certainly
would
be
killed
in
less
than
ten
seconds
so
without
stopping
to
take
thought
and
upon
the
impulse
of
one
of
those
rare
intuitions
under
the
influence
of
which
persons
move
so
accurately
balser
lifted
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
he
could
see
the
bear
s
head
plainly
as
it
swayed
from
side
to
side
just
over
tom
s
throat
and
it
seemed
that
he
could
not
miss
his
aim
almost
without
looking
he
pulled
the
trigger
he
felt
the
rebound
of
the
gun
and
heard
the
report
breaking
the
heavy
silence
of
the
night
then
he
dropped
the
gun
upon
the
snow
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
fearing
to
see
the
result
of
his
shot
he
stood
for
a
moment
trembling
the
dogs
had
stopped
barking
the
bear
had
stopped
growling
jim
had
ceased
to
cry
out
tom
had
ceased
his
call
for
help
and
the
deep
silence
rested
upon
balser
s
heart
like
a
load
of
lead
he
could
not
take
his
hands
from
his
face
after
a
moment
he
felt
jim
s
little
hand
upon
his
arm
and
tom
said
as
he
drew
himself
from
beneath
the
bear
balser
there
s
no
man
or
boy
living
but
you
that
could
have
made
that
shot
in
the
then
balser
knew
that
he
had
killed
the
bear
and
he
sank
upon
the
snow
and
wept
as
if
his
heart
would
break
notwithstanding
the
intense
cold
the
excitement
of
battle
had
made
the
boys
unconscious
of
it
and
tom
and
jim
stood
by
balser
s
side
as
he
sat
upon
the
snow
and
they
did
not
feel
the
sting
of
the
night
poor
little
jim
who
was
so
given
to
grumbling
much
to
the
surprise
of
his
companions
fell
upon
his
knees
and
said
don
t
cry
balser
don
t
cry
although
the
tears
were
falling
over
the
little
fellow
s
own
cheeks
don
t
cry
any
more
balser
the
bear
is
dead
all
over
i
heard
the
bullet
whiz
past
my
ears
and
i
heard
it
strike
the
bear
s
head
just
as
plain
as
you
can
hear
that
owl
hoot
and
then
i
knew
that
you
had
saved
tom
and
me
because
nobody
can
shoot
as
well
as
you
the
little
fellow
s
tenderness
and
his
pride
in
balser
seemed
all
the
sweeter
because
it
sprang
from
his
childish
gruffness
tom
and
jim
helped
balser
to
his
feet
and
they
went
over
to
the
spot
where
the
bear
was
lying
stone
dead
with
balser
s
bullet
in
his
brain
the
dogs
were
sniffing
at
the
dead
bear
and
the
monster
brute
lay
upon
the
snow
in
the
moonlight
and
looked
like
a
huge
incarnate
fiend
after
examining
him
for
a
moment
the
boys
slowly
walked
back
to
the
tree
when
they
had
entered
they
raked
the
coals
together
put
on
an
armful
of
wood
called
in
the
dogs
to
share
their
comfort
hung
up
the
deerskin
at
the
door
drew
the
bearskins
in
front
of
the
fire
and
sat
down
to
talk
and
think
since
there
was
no
sleep
left
in
their
eyes
for
the
rest
of
that
night
after
a
long
silence
jim
said
i
told
you
he
d
come
but
he
didn
t
eat
us
replied
tom
determined
that
jim
should
not
be
right
in
everything
he
d
have
eaten
you
limpy
fox
if
balser
hadn
t
been
the
best
shot
in
the
that
s
what
he
would
answered
tom
half
inclined
to
cry
nonsense
said
balser
anybody
could
have
done
well
i
reckon
not
said
jim
me
and
tom
and
the
dogs
and
the
bear
was
as
thick
as
six
in
a
bed
and
honest
balser
i
think
you
had
to
shoot
around
a
curve
to
miss
us
all
but
the
after
a
few
minutes
jim
said
golly
wasn
t
that
an
awful
fight
we
had
in
here
before
the
bear
got
out
yes
it
was
returned
balser
seriously
well
i
rather
think
it
was
continued
jim
honestly
fellows
i
ran
around
this
here
room
so
fast
for
a
while
i
could
see
my
own
back
most
of
the
balser
and
tom
laughed
and
tom
said
jim
if
you
keep
on
improving
you
ll
be
a
bigger
liar
than
that
fellow
in
the
bible
before
you
re
half
his
then
the
boys
lapsed
into
silence
and
the
dogs
lay
stretched
before
the
fire
till
the
welcome
sun
began
to
climb
the
hill
of
the
sky
and
spread
his
blessed
tints
of
gray
and
blue
and
pink
and
red
followed
by
the
glorious
flood
of
day
after
breakfast
the
boys
skinned
the
bear
and
cut
his
carcass
into
small
is
such
portions
of
it
as
they
cared
to
keep
they
hung
the
bearskin
and
meat
upon
the
branches
of
their
castle
beyond
the
reach
of
wolves
and
foxes
and
they
gave
to
tige
and
prince
each
a
piece
of
meat
that
made
their
sides
stand
out
with
fulness
the
saving
of
the
bear
meat
and
skin
consumed
most
of
the
morning
and
at
noon
the
boys
took
a
loin
steak
from
the
bear
and
broiled
it
upon
the
coals
for
dinner
after
dinner
they
began
the
real
work
of
the
expedition
by
preparing
to
set
the
traps
when
all
was
ready
they
started
up
the
creek
each
boy
carrying
a
load
of
traps
over
his
shoulder
at
a
distance
of
a
little
more
than
half
a
mile
from
the
castle
they
found
a
beaver
dam
stretching
across
the
creek
and
at
the
water
s
edge
near
each
end
of
the
dam
they
saw
numberless
tracks
made
by
the
little
animals
whose
precious
pelts
they
were
so
anxious
to
obtain
i
should
like
to
tell
you
of
the
marvellous
home
of
that
wonderful
little
animal
the
beaver
and
of
his
curious
habits
and
instincts
how
he
chops
wood
and
digs
into
the
ground
and
plasters
his
home
under
the
water
with
mud
using
his
tail
for
shovel
and
trowel
but
all
that
you
may
learn
from
any
book
on
natural
history
and
i
assure
you
it
will
be
found
interesting
reading
the
boys
placed
five
or
six
traps
upon
the
beaver
paths
on
each
side
of
the
creek
and
then
continued
their
journey
up
stream
until
they
found
a
little
opening
in
the
ice
down
to
which
from
the
bank
above
ran
a
path
telling
plainly
of
the
many
kinds
of
animals
that
had
been
going
there
to
drink
there
they
set
a
few
traps
and
baited
them
with
small
pieces
of
bear
meat
and
then
they
returned
home
intending
to
visit
the
traps
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
and
hoping
to
reap
a
rich
harvest
of
pelts
when
the
boys
reached
home
it
lacked
little
more
than
an
hour
of
sunset
but
the
young
fellows
had
recovered
from
the
excitement
of
the
night
before
which
had
somewhat
destroyed
their
appetites
for
breakfast
and
dinner
and
by
the
time
they
had
returned
from
setting
their
traps
those
same
appetites
were
asserting
themselves
with
a
vigour
that
showed
plainly
enough
a
fixed
determination
to
make
up
for
lost
time
how
would
a
wild
turkey
or
a
venison
steak
taste
for
supper
asked
balser
jim
simply
looked
up
at
him
with
a
greedy
hungry
expression
and
exclaimed
the
one
taste
well
i
ll
go
down
the
creek
a
little
way
and
see
what
i
can
find
you
fellows
stay
here
and
build
a
fire
so
that
we
can
have
a
fine
bed
of
coals
when
i
balser
shouldered
his
gun
and
went
down
the
creek
to
find
his
supper
he
did
not
take
the
dogs
for
he
hoped
to
kill
a
wild
turkey
and
dogs
are
apt
to
bark
in
the
pursuit
of
squirrels
and
rabbits
thereby
frightening
the
turkey
which
is
a
shy
and
wary
bird
illustration
when
the
boy
had
travelled
quite
a
long
distance
down
stream
he
began
to
fear
that
after
all
he
should
be
compelled
to
content
himself
with
a
rabbit
or
two
for
supper
so
he
turned
homeward
and
scanned
the
woods
carefully
for
the
humble
game
that
he
might
not
go
home
entirely
upon
his
journey
down
the
creek
rabbits
had
sprung
up
on
every
side
of
him
but
now
that
he
wanted
a
pair
for
supper
they
all
had
mysteriously
disappeared
and
he
feared
that
he
and
the
boys
and
the
dogs
would
be
compelled
to
content
themselves
with
bear
meat
illustration
espied
a
doe
and
a
fawn
standing
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
when
the
boy
was
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
home
and
had
almost
despaired
of
obtaining
even
a
rabbit
he
espied
a
doe
and
a
fawn
standing
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
at
a
distance
of
sixty
or
seventy
yards
watching
him
intently
with
their
great
brown
eyes
so
full
of
fatal
curiosity
balser
imitated
the
cry
of
the
fawn
and
held
the
attention
of
the
doe
until
he
was
enabled
to
lessen
the
distance
by
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
then
he
shot
the
fawn
knowing
that
if
he
did
so
its
mother
the
doe
would
run
for
a
short
distance
and
would
return
to
the
fawn
in
the
meantime
balser
would
load
his
gun
and
would
kill
the
doe
when
she
returned
and
so
it
happened
that
the
doe
and
the
fawn
each
fell
a
victim
to
our
hunter
s
skill
balser
threw
the
fawn
over
his
shoulder
and
carried
it
to
the
castle
then
the
boys
took
one
of
the
sleds
and
fetched
home
the
doe
they
hung
the
doe
high
upon
the
branches
of
the
sycamore
and
cut
the
fawn
into
small
pieces
which
they
put
upon
the
ice
of
the
creek
and
covered
with
snow
that
the
meat
might
quickly
cool
the
bed
of
coals
was
ready
and
the
boys
were
ready
too
you
may
be
sure
soon
the
fawn
meat
cooled
and
soon
each
boy
was
devouring
a
savoury
piece
that
had
been
broiled
upon
the
coals
after
supper
the
boys
again
built
a
fine
fire
and
sat
before
it
talking
of
the
events
of
the
day
and
wondering
how
many
beavers
foxes
coons
and
muskrats
they
would
find
in
their
traps
next
morning
as
the
fire
died
down
drowsiness
stole
over
our
trappers
who
were
in
the
habit
of
going
to
bed
soon
after
sunset
and
they
again
crept
in
between
the
bearskins
with
jim
in
the
middle
they
however
took
the
precaution
to
keep
tige
and
prince
in
the
same
room
with
them
and
the
boys
slept
that
night
without
fear
of
an
intrusion
such
as
had
disturbed
them
the
night
before
next
morning
bright
and
early
the
boys
hurried
up
the
creek
to
examine
their
traps
and
greatly
to
their
joy
found
five
beavers
and
several
minks
coons
and
muskrats
safely
captured
near
one
of
the
traps
was
the
foot
of
a
fox
which
its
possessor
had
bitten
off
in
the
night
when
he
learned
that
he
could
not
free
it
from
the
cruel
steel
the
boys
killed
the
animals
they
had
caught
by
striking
them
on
the
head
with
a
heavy
club
which
method
of
inflicting
death
did
not
damage
the
pelts
as
a
sharp
instrument
or
bullet
would
have
done
after
resetting
the
traps
our
hunters
placed
the
game
upon
the
sled
and
hurried
home
to
their
castle
where
the
pelts
were
carefully
removed
stretched
upon
forked
sticks
and
hung
up
to
dry
our
heroes
remained
in
camp
for
ten
or
twelve
days
and
each
morning
brought
them
a
fine
supply
of
fur
they
met
with
no
other
adventure
worthy
to
be
related
and
one
day
was
like
another
they
awakened
each
morning
with
the
sun
and
ate
their
breakfast
of
broiled
venison
fish
or
quail
with

and
then
a
rabbit
upon
one
occasion
they
had
the
breast
of
a
wild
turkey
they
sought
the
traps
took
the
game
prepared
the
pelts
ate
their
dinners
and
suppers
of
broiled
meats
and
baked
sweet
potatoes
and
slumbered
cozily
beneath
their
warm
bearskins
till
morning
one
day
balser
noticed
that
the
snow
was
melting
and
was
falling
from
the
trees
he
and
his
companions
had
taken
enough
pelts
to
make
a
heavy
load
upon
each
of
the
sleds
they
feared
that
the
weather
might
suddenly
grow
warm
and
that
the
snow
might
disappear
so
they
leisurely
packed
the
pelts
and
their
belongings
and
next
morning
started
for
home

were
glad
to

home
but
it

a
touch
of

when
they
passed
around
the

in
the

they

is
the
fairest
