at
that
instant
the
bear
came
to
life
i
plunged
downward
struggling
frantically
i
sat
down
by
the
fiddler
and
dozed
i
glimpsed
his
flaming
eyes
and
mouth
sheep
and
rock
dropped
straight
toward
me
never
before
had
the
ring
of
an
ax
echoed
in
silent
valley
see
all
fools
ai
dead
yit
he
observed
the
memory
of
that
race
for
life
is
still
vividly
terrifying
every
fall
i
watched
and
peg
at
their
repairs
they
turned
tail
and
came
racing
back
straight
toward
me
out
of
the
dust
of
years
we
dug
the
history
of
a
buried
past
a
mountain
boyhood
chapter
one
going
west
father
and
mother
settled
on
the
kansas
prairie
in
the
early
fifties
at
that
time
kansas
was
the
frontier
near
neighbors
were
twenty
miles
or
more
apart
there
was
no
railroad
no
stages
supplied
the
vast
unsettled
region
a
few
supplies
were
freighted
by
wagon
however
little
was
needed
from
civilized
sources
for
the
frontier
teemed
with
game
myriads
of
prairie
chickens
were
almost
as
tame
as
domestic
fowls
deer
stared
in
amazement
at
the
early
settlers
bands
of
buffalo
snorted
in
surprise
as
the
first
dark
lines
of
sod
were
broken
up
droves
of
wild
turkey
skirted
the
fringes
of
timber
indians
roamed
freely
halting
in
wonder
at
the
first
log
cabins
of
the
pioneers
in
my
father
old
diary
i
found
the
following
june
drove
through
from
iowa
to
kansas
by
ox
team
located
four
days
drive
south
of
portsmouth
not
much
timber
here
later
kansas
city
october
just
returned
from
visit
to
our
nearest
neighbor
john
seeright
a
day
drive
away
took
the
chickens
and
cow
along
and
stayed
several
days
father
told
me
that
the
early
settlers
did
not
like
a
region
after
it
got
settled
up
he
laughed
heartily
when
he
said
this
it
is
quite
true
nevertheless
as
soon
as
a
region
became
settled
up
the
pioneers
were
ready
to
push
on
again
into
the
unknown
they
loved
the
frontier
it
held
adventure
hazard
always
mystery
ofttimes
romance
life
they
moved
ahead
of
and
beyond
civilization
even
the
long
arm
of
the
law
did
not
penetrate
their
wilderness
fastnesses
their
experience
so
numerous
books
can
not
hold
them
all
have
become
history
it
is
not
strange
that
my
parents
welcomed
the
gold
rush
of
it
called
them
once
more
into
the
farther
wilderness
the
vaster
unknown
when
news
of
the
finding
of
gold
in
the
rockies
came
across
the
plains
legions
of
adventurers
trailed
westward
the
few
roads
that
led
across
the
rolling
prairies
to
the
rockies
were
soon
wagons
trains
strung
out
across
the
treeless
land
like
huge
creeping
serpents
moving
lazily
in
the
sun
joyfully
the
adventurers
went
happy
courageous
they
were
the
vanguards
of
civilization
pushing
ever
to
the
west
to
my
lifelong
regret
my
boyhood
came
after
the
gold
rushes
were
over
the
buffalo
bands
had
passed
for
the
last
time
the
indian
fighting
ended
however
these
exciting
events
were
still
fresh
in
the
memory
of
my
parents
when
neighbors
came
to
visit
us
long
hours
were
spent
in
talking
over
and
comparing
experiences
i
thrilled
as
my
father
told
of
climbing
long
peak
the
eastern
sentinel
of
the
rockies
of
estes
park
teeming
with
trout
and
game
i
thought
then
that
i
had
been
born
too
late
that
all
the
big
things
in
the
world
were
past
history
i
feared
then
that
even
the
rockies
would
lose
their
wildness
before
i
could
explore
them
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
farm
where
i
was
born
a
number
of
civil
war
skirmishes
took
place
the
eastern
kansas
border
during
the
trying
time
of
the
early
sixties
was
perhaps
the
worst
place
in
all
the
world
to
live
raiding
parties
plundered
on
both
sides
of
the
line
my
mother
watched
the
battle
of
mine
creek
from
the
dooryard
saw
the
soldiers
streaming
by
and
prayed
fervently
as
the
tide
of
battle
swayed
back
and
forth
my
father
was
fighting
in
that
battle
these
frontier
conflicts
were
still
the
favorite
topics
of
conversation
at
neighborhood
gatherings
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
listened
breathlessly
to
them
and
lived
them
over
in
my
imagination
of
all
the
tales
recounted
around
our
fire
i
loved
that
of
the
gold
rush
of
best
my
father
and
mother
had
participated
in
it
and
sure
that
story
moved
me
most
of
all
to
obey
horace
injunction
the
wagons
in
the
beginning
of
the
journey
formed
a
train
keeping
close
together
for
mutual
protection
as
they
neared
the
rockies
they
scattered
each
party
following
its
individual
route
late
in
the
summer
high
up
in
the
mountains
near
breckenridge
colorado
my
father
fell
ill
of
mountain
fever
my
mother
who
weighed
less
than
one
hundred
pounds
alone
drove
the
pony
team
back
across
the
plains
to
eastern
kansas
many
weeks
were
spent
en
route
sometimes
they
camped
for
a
night
with
wagons
then
resumed
the
eastward
journey
alone
buffalo
migrating
southward
literally
covered
the
prairie
at
times
so
dense
were
their
ranks
my
mother
had
to
stop
the
team
to
let
the
herds
go
by
one
experience
of
this
trying
trip
often
related
by
my
father
filled
me
with
lasting
admiration
for
my
plucky
mother
we
were
camped
one
night
beneath
some
cottonwoods
beside
a
wide
shallow
stream
father
would
say
and
i
was
unable
to
move
from
my
bed
in
the
wagon
your
mother
cared
for
the
team
started
a
fire
and
got
supper
shortly
after
dark
and
before
supper
was
ready
a
dozen
indians
filed
solemnly
into
our
camp
and
sat
down
facing
the
fire
they
said
nothing
but
followed
your
mother
every
movement
with
watchful
eyes
if
your
mother
tasted
the
brew
in
the
brass
kettle
every
indian
eye
followed
her
hand
and
every
indian
licked
his
lips
eagerly
the
brass
kettle
was
about
the
only
cooking
utensil
we
possessed
and
your
mother
guarded
it
carefully
this
night
the
kettle
held
a
savory
stew
of
buffalo
meat
when
the
stew
was
done
your
mother
set
it
off
the
fire
to
cool
during
a
few
seconds
while
her
back
was
turned
the
kettle
vanished
from
the
shelter
of
the
wagon
i
saw
an
indian
reach
out
stealthily
and
slip
it
beneath
his
blanket
the
next
moment
your
mother
was
facing
the
silent
circle
with
blazing
eyes
and
there
hundreds
of
miles
from
a
settlement
with
no
help
at
hand
she
defied
a
dozen
indians
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
weighed
just
pounds
she
swept
around
the
circle
slapping
the
surprised
braves
pulling
their
hair
and
demanding
the
kettle
she
noticed
that
the
chief
was
sheltering
something
beneath
his
blanket
at
once
she
gave
his
blanket
a
jerk
the
hot
brew
spilled
over
the
surprised
redskin
legs
there
was
a
yell
that
rent
the
stillness
the
fellow
leaped
high
into
the
air
and
vanished
into
the
night
leaving
the
brass
kettle
behind
him
little
did
my
parents
realize
that
their
recounted
experiences
would
eventually
lead
me
still
a
boy
to
venture
into
new
regions
at
ten
years
of
age
i
hazarded
the
statement
that
i
was
old
enough
to
shift
for
myself
that
i
was
going
west
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
in
the
rocky
mountains
but
my
parents
in
order
to
frighten
me
out
of
my
plans
told
me
that
indians
still
infested
the
wilds
that
terrible
bull
buffaloes
and
horrible
grizzly
bears
roamed
the
wilderness
these
attempts
to
frighten
me
only
strengthened
my
desire
for
adventure
and
my
determination
to
seek
it
when
all
else
failed
i
was
told
that
i
was
too
young
to
strike
out
for
myself
at
last
father
put
his
foot
down
firmly
a
sign
that
his
patience
was
at
an
end
so
i
postponed
my
adventure
the
day
finally
came
when
i
was
aboard
a
train
heading
westward
toward
the
mountains
of
my
dreams
i
possessed
twenty
dollars
my
entire
savings
during
the
journey
i
hardly
slept
but
kept
watch
out
the
window
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
rockies
i
have
no
recollection
that
there
were
sleeping
cars
at
that
time
anyhow
my
thin
little
purse
afforded
no
such
gross
extravagance
if
i
had
known
i
recall
that
the
individual
seat
of
the
gave
me
much
concern
i
had
considerable
trouble
adjusting
it
putting
it
up
and
laying
it
down
beside
me
in
the
companion
seat
rode
a
man
of
middle
age
bearded
roughly
dressed
who
took
keen
interest
in
my
destination
he
was
located
i
learned
over
the
continental
divide
in
that
vast
region
beyond
grand
lake
he
talked
of
the
forests
of
uncut
timber
near
his
homestead
of
the
fertile
valleys
and
grassy
parks
that
would
eventually
support
cattle
herds
some
day
he
predicted
be
a
railroad
built
between
denver
and
salt
lake
city
and
when
it
comes
it
bound
to
pass
close
to
my
claim
at
dawn
i
caught
my
first
sight
of
the
great
peaks
a
hundred
miles
away
rearing
in
the
early
morning
light
at
first
i
mistook
those
misty
ranges
for
cloud
banks
lighted
by
the
rising
sun
then
as
we
drew
nearer
and
day
wore
on
i
made
them
out
toward
noon
i
reached
fort
collins
colorado
fifty
miles
from
peak
where
there
was
no
stage
connection
with
estes
park
but
loveland
a
town
fifteen
miles
south
had
a
horse
stage
that
made
three
trips
a
week
the
fare
i
learned
was
quite
prohibitive
three
dollars
for
something
more
than
thirty
miles
the
walk
would
be
interesting
i
decided
but
the
old
canvas
bag
containing
all
my
worldly
possessions
was
too
bulky
and
awkward
to
be
carried
after
some
hours
of
dickering
i
paid
eight
dollars
for
a
bicycle
tied
the
bag
on
the
handle
bars
and
started
for
the
mecca
of
my
dreams
that
first
journey
to
the
mountains
was
filled
with
thrills
the
old
stage
road
shot
up
successive
mountain
ranges
and
plunged
abruptly
down
into
the
valleys
between
there
was
no
big
thompson
route
then
instead
the
road
ascended
bald
mountain
climbed
the
foothill
range
crossed
the
top
then
dropped
into
rattlesnake
park
it
squirmed
up
pole
hill
a
grade
so
steep
that
i
could
scarcely
push
up
my
wheel
up
and
down
up
and
down
it
seesawed
endlessly
the
afternoon
wore
on
each
successive
slope
grew
harder
for
my
legs
were
weary
twice
braking
with
one
foot
on
the
front
crotch
and
sliding
the
wheel
i
had
pitched
headlong
over
the
handle
bars
upon
two
descents
that
were
too
precipitous
to
venture
unballasted
i
tied
pine
trees
to
the
rear
of
my
craft
to
act
as
as
darkness
came
on
i
coasted
down
a
sharp
pitch
to
a
little
brook
in
the
aspens
that
bordered
the
road
was
a
range
cow
standing
guard
beside
a
newborn
calf
across
the
road
like
grisly
shadows
among
the
trees
skulked
several
coyotes
the
calf
half
rose
wabbled
and
went
down
three
times
it
attempted
to
rise
grew
weaker
and
at
last
gave
up
the
struggle
with
the
waiting
coyotes
in
mind
i
leaned
my
wheel
against
a
bowlder
and
went
to
its
rescue
several
things
happened
at
once
the
range
cow
misunderstood
my
good
intentions
she
was
accustomed
to
seeing
men
on
horseback
and
one
afoot
was
strange
she
charged
headlong
i
dodged
quickly
aside
but
not
in
time
to
escape
entirely
she
raked
me
with
her
sharp
horns
there
was
a
wild
race
through
the
aspens
i
leading
but
the
cow
a
close
second
her
horns
menacing
me
at
every
leap
while
i
doubled
and
backtracked
sharply
about
among
the
trees
i
had
no
chance
to
tree
though
no
mountain
lion
was
ever
more
willing
for
cow
was
too
near
only
providence
and
my
agility
saved
me
from
an
untimely
end
at
last
the
cow
halted
for
she
was
getting
too
far
from
her
calf
she
shook
her
horns
after
me
menacingly
turned
and
hurried
back
toward
where
her
offspring
lay
each
mile
i
covered
impressed
upon
me
more
and
more
that
there
is
not
even
a
distant
relationship
between
mountain
miles
and
my
kansas
prairie
miles
the
latter
are
ironed
out
flat
the
former
stand
on
end
cease
to
be
miles
and
become
trials
slowly
the
shadows
filled
the
cañons
and
came
creeping
up
the
slopes
i
gazed
in
awesome
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
my
land
of
dreams
my
legs
cramped
almost
past
pedaling
still
kept
on
for
my
goal
my
mountains
were
at
hand
exaltation
of
spirit
overcame
exhaustion
of
body
at
no
time
had
i
given
any
particular
thought
to
what
would
happen
when
i
arrived
so
far
my
whole
attention
had
been
centered
on
reaching
the
rockies
such
trivialities
as
no
job
no
relatives
practically
no
money
made
little
impression
upon
my
mind
long
after
nightfall
i
reached
the
crest
of
park
hill
the
last
barrier
to
estes
park
the
moon
shone
full
upon
the
valley
below
and
upon
the
mountains
beyond
the
river
murmured
softly
as
its
shining
folds
curled
back
and
forth
across
the
dark
green
meadow
suddenly
vanishing
between
dark
cañon
walls
coyotes
raised
their
eerie
voices
across
the
cañon
from
the
cliffs
of
mount
olympus
an
owl
hooted
gloomily
before
me
loomed
the
rockies
strangely
unreal
in
the
moonlight
and
yet
very
like
the
mountains
of
my
imagination
i
gazed
spellbound
my
dream
was
realized
it
was
midnight
when
completely
exhausted
i
stopped
before
an
old
log
cabin
dogs
charged
out
barking
furiously
at
the
strange
thing
i
rode
and
nipping
at
my
legs
but
i
was
too
weary
to
remember
distinctly
even
now
what
happened
i
must
have
tumbled
off
my
wheel
for
i
learned
afterward
that
i
was
picked
up
and
put
to
bed
but
for
hours
i
tossed
about
my
body
racked
with
pain
my
thoughts
jumbled
but
boys
must
sleep
and
i
slept
at
last
next
morning
pushing
the
wheel
slowly
i
headed
for
the
most
remote
ranch
in
the
region
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
long
peak
progress
was
slow
and
painful
for
my
body
was
stiff
and
sore
the
road
i
followed
wound
upward
climbing
steadily
to
higher
altitude
frequently
i
halted
to
rest
and
spent
my
time
of
respite
searching
the
mountains
with
eager
appraising
eyes
planning
explorations
among
them
toward
noon
i
came
to
the
ranch
i
sought
located
nine
miles
from
the
nearest
neighbor
at
nine
thousand
feet
altitude
and
surrounded
by
rugged
mountains
above
it
rose
long
peak
up
and
up
into
the
clouds
to
more
than
fourteen
thousand
feet
the
rancher
was
the
reverend
lamb
one
of
the
early
settlers
of
estes
park
the
parson
as
he
was
known
was
more
than
six
feet
tall
straight
as
a
pine
physically
and
even
more
so
spiritually
he
wore
a
long
flowing
beard
rose
habitually
and
unprotestingly
at
four
in
the
morning
a
man
of
diverse
talents
and
eccentricities

ranch
consisted
of
a
fenced

tract
surrounded
on
every
side
for
miles
by
high
mountains
that
shut
it
in
there
was
heavy
forest
on
the
slopes
above
the

out
of
these
came
many

my
few
remaining
dollars
the
parson
gave
me
room
and
board
in
return
for
which
i
helped
about
the
place
doing
various
chores
such
as
and
clearing
land
for
more
garden
and
occasionally
going
the
nine
miles
to
the
village
for
the
mail
my
work
took
only
a
small
part
of
my
time
leaving
me
free
to
explore
the
region
with
its
deep
evergreen
forests
and
the
wild
animals
which
lived
in
them
many
were
the
tales
the
tall
rawboned
parson
told
of
his
early
pioneer
days
for
he
had
lived
there
since
the
early
seventies
and
was
a
loquacious
old
fellow
as
he
and
his
wife
jane
and
i
sat
beside
the
granite
fireplace
when
the
coals
glowed
low
and
the
shadows
scurried
here
and
there
over
the
rough
logs
of
the
cabin
walls
he
had
been
shot
and
nearly
killed
by
a
bandit
gored
by
a
bull
dragged
by
a
frightened
horse
and
bitten
by
a
bear
upon
one
lonely
excursion
far
from
any
settlement
he
had
been
followed
by
a
huge
stealthy
mountain
lion
harrowing
as
were
these
tales
the
one
that
made
me
shiver
despite
the
radiant
pitch
knots
was
that
of
his
perilous
descent
of
the
precipice
on
long
peak
time
has
not
changed
the
character
of
that
face
it
is
sheer
and
smooth
and
icy
now
as
then
he
was
probably
the
first
man
to
attempt
its
descent
and
i
was
always
weak
and
spent
when
he
ended
his
story
of
it
so
vividly
did
he
portray
its
dangers
i
sat
tense
digging
my
nails
deep
into
my
palms
living
through
every
squirm
and
twist
with
him
from
the
moment
he
slid
down
from
the
comparatively
safe
narrows
to
the
first
niche
in
the
glassy
precipitous
wall
till
after
many
experiences
he
landed
safely
at
its
foot
that
adventure
had
almost
cost
him
his
life
for
he
had
once
missed
his
foothold
slipped
and
slid
and
had
hung
suspended
by
one
hand
for
a
long
terrible
moment
always
i
sat
with
eyes
glued
upon
the
thrilling
as
he
talked
planning
secretly
to
emulate
his
example
proving
some
of
his
statements
by
daily
short
excursions
however
the
parson
was
not
always
away
on
trips
sometimes
he
guided
visitors
to
the
top
of
the
peak
or
worked
on
the
trail
to
its
summit
he
chopped
wood
worked
in
the
garden
hunted
stray
cattle
or
horses
frequently
he
rode
off
with
his
bible
under
his
arm
for
he
was
a
circuit
rider
carrying
the
gospel
into
the
wilderness
he
gave
good
if
free
advice
officiated
at
weddings
and
funerals
at
and
he
preached
or
worked
as
the
notion
moved
him
lingered
in
one
place
or
rode
long
trails
to
fulfill
his
mission
his
own
ranch
was
thirty
miles
from
the
railroad
but
many
of
his
calls
were
made
on
settlers
even
more
remote
gradually
i
extended
the
scope
of
my
explorations
frequently
spending
the
night
abroad
carrying
a
pair
of
worn
and
faded
blankets
and
a
little
food
a
number
of
times
i
climbed
long
peak
alone
on
these
trips
to
high
country
i
scouted
the
crest
of
battle
mountain
lady
washington
storm
peak
and
mount
meeker
explored
glacier
gorge
investigated
chasm
lake
and
from
the
top
of
peak
and
meeker
looked
down
into
wild
basin
to
the
south
i
sketched
a
rude
map
of
the
great
basin
in
my
notebook
and
named
it
land
of
many
waters
because
of
the
scores
of
small
streams
that
trickled
down
its
inclosing
mountain
sides
the
oval
bowl
i
estimated
to
be
fifteen
miles
long
by
about
half
as
wide
its
sides
formed
of
mountain
slopes
densely
wooded
up
to
bleak
timberline
save
the
murmur
of
falling
water
or
the
wind
upon
the
heights
it
was
a
land
of
silence
small
streams
converged
dropped
into
deep
cañons
and
reached
the
river
that
rumbled
far
below
there
were
vivid
emerald
lakes
everywhere
some
lost
in
the
woods
near
the
river
others
pocketed
behind
the
ridges
while
still
more
could
be
seen
up
above
naked
timberline
i
returned
thrilled
with
the
thought
of
exploring
wild
basin
sought
the
parson
and
told
him
my
ambition
at
first
he
was
much
amused
but
when
he
found
i
was
serious
he
grew
grave
there
no
neighbors
over
that
way
he
objected
if
anything
happens
you
be
beyond
help
even
though
he
was
older
and
much
more
experienced
i
thought
him
hardly
qualified
after
his
own
foolhardy
adventures
to
discourage
me
but
i
decided
to
wait
until
fall
before
setting
out
this
delay
would
enable
me
to
know
more
about
the
mountains
to
add
to
my
experience
and
better
fit
me
to
cope
with
the
emergencies
of
that
inviting
great
unknown
wild
basin
everywhere
i
found
strange
birds
and
animals
and
began
to
get
acquainted
with
them
the
handsome
black
and
white
magpies
were
much
like
the
crows
i
had
known
in
kansas
so
far
as
wariness
was
concerned
the
rocky
mountain
jays
quite
unlike
our
prairie
jays
much
more
brilliant
in
coloring
their
gorgeous
coats
of
turquoise
blue
and
black
flashing
in
the
sunshine
were
continually
bickering
and
following
me
through
the
woods
to
see
what
i
was
about
chickadees
and
nuthatches
were
always
inspecting
the
trees
for
food
running
up
and
down
paying
no
attention
to
me
and
going
about
their
business
with
cheerful
little
chirrups
that
expressed
their
contentment
occasionally
a
crow
flew
up
the
valley
with
raucous
calls
and
sometimes
a
raven
pursued
his
way
toward
the
deeper
woods
meadow
larks
and
robins
were
everywhere
woodpeckers
and
flickers
did
their
bit
to
keep
vermin
off
the
trees
and
performed
daily
operations
on
trunk
and
limb
removing
borers
and
beetles
that
had
penetrated
beneath
the
bark
thus
saving
the
lives
of
many
evergreen
monarchs
around
ten
and
eleven
thousand
feet
there
were
campbirds
canada
jays
friendly
and
inquisitive
on
first
acquaintance
they
often
took
food
from
my
hands
and
helped
themselves
freely
of
any
food
accessible
in
camp
they
were
unruffled
flitting
softly
from
tree
to
tree
with
little
flapping
calling
low
and
in
a
sweetly
confidential
tone
however
friendly
i
found
the
birds
the
big
game
animals
were
extremely
wary
i
mentioned
the
fact
to
the
parson
they
been
shot
at
was
his
explanation
every
time
they
come
in
contact
with
men
they
suffered
they
know
men
are
dangerous
always
have
guns
in
spite
of
the
parson
observations
we
always
had
wild
game
hanging
in
the
log
meat
house
there
was
never
any
question
about
securing
whatever
we
wanted
in
that
line
except
during
the
winter
months
deer
could
be
had
with
little
effort
but
the
elk
had
practically
vanished
occasionally
a
lone
survivor
strayed
into
the
ranch
valley
there
were
bears
of
course
shy
and
fearful
in
the
rough
unsettled
country
we
had
great
variety
of
meat
venison
bighorn
sheep
grouse
ptarmigan
wild
pigeon
sometimes
squirrel
and
rarely
bear
steaks
wherever
i
went
even
in
the
places
where
few
men
had
ever
been
the
deer
and
elk
and
bear
were
very
wild
and
i
found
it
impossible
to
approach
them
unless
the
wind
was
from
them
to
me
and
i
moved
forward
carefully
hidden
i
spent
many
eventful
days
walking
climbing
sitting
motionless
to
watch
the
scampering
chipmunks
or
to
invite
the
birds
up
close
thus
a
little
at
a
time
i
came
to
know
the
habits
of
the
wild
folks
i
met
learned
their
likes
and
dislikes
the
things
that
excited
their
curiosity
and
that
frightened
them
away
in
panic
upon
my
first
climb
to
the
top
of
long
peak
alone
i
halted
above
timberline
and
stared
about
in
amazement
at
the
wide
stretches
of
slopes
from
a
distance
these
had
appeared
no
larger
than
a
back
yard
but
a
revealed
they
were
miles
across
and
instead
of
being
barren
were
a
series
of
hanging
gardens
one
above
another
each
of
different
shape
and
size
and
all
green
with
grass
and
with
a
hundred
different
kinds
of
wild
flowers
waving
in
the
sunshine
i
counted
more
than
fifty
varieties
none
of
which
i
knew
and
still
they
seemed
endless
usually
i
wandered
off
the
trail
to
follow
birds
or
animals
in
the
zone
above
were
birds
entirely
strange
to
me
and
animals
that
never
came
down
to
the
valley
of
the
ranch
it
was
not
long
before
i
discovered
that
nearly
all
birds
and
animals
live
at
a
certain
zone
of
altitude
rarely
straying
above
or
below
it
occasionally
i
heard
a
queer
it
sounded
close
yet
its
maker
was
invisible
many
times
i
looked
up
searching
the
air
overhead
for
the
elusive
at
last
i
came
upon
a
bunch
of
grass
no
larger
than
a
water
pail
and
stopped
to
examine
it
grass
and
flowers
had
been
piled
loosely
in
an
irregular
heap
resembling
a
miniature
haystack
something
making
a
nest
i
observed
aloud
denied
a
shrill
voice
almost
at
my
elbow
ten
feet
away
upon
a
bowlder
that
rose
above
the
rest
of
the
rocks
sat
a
small
animal
which
at
first
i
mistook
for
a
young
rabbit
in
shape
and
size
he
closely
resembled
a
cottontail
but
his
ears
were
different
from
any
rabbit
being
short
and
round
his
eyes
were
beady
somehow
he
made
me
think
of
a
rat
he
ran
down
the
rock
and
climbed
to
another
perch
not
even
so
much
tail
as
a
bunny
none
at
all
in
some
respects
he
resembled
a
rabbit
a
squirrel
and
a
prairie
dog
his
actions
reminded
me
of
all
of
them
in
fact
he
is
sometimes
called
rock
rabbit
and
little
chief
hare
he
may
have
other
names
besides
i
watched
the
interesting
little
fellow
for
some
time
and
later
found
his
actions
characteristic
of
his
tribe
he
literally
makes
hay
while
the
summer
shines
he
is
the
only
harvester
i
ever
saw
who
works
on
the
run
he
dashed
at
top
speed
without
stopping
for
breath
bit
off
a
mouthful
of
grass
and
again
ran
for
his
growing
stack
he
scampered
down
its
side
then
leaped
from
an
adjacent
rock
to
its
top
laden
with
his
bundle
of
hay
evidently
he
found
the
alpine
summer
short
and
felt
it
necessary
to
step
lively
altitude
that
convenient
scapegoat
of
tenderfeet
did
not
seem
to
affect
his
wind
or
his
endurance
he
stacked
his
harvest
in
one
corner
of
the
field
from
which
he
cut
it
he
cut
flowers
along
with
the
grass
perhaps
he
used
them
for
flavor
as
grandmother
put
leaves
in
her
jelly
the
haycock
he
built
was
about
the
size
of
a
bucket
i
have
since
seen
them
as
large
as
bushel
baskets
his
tiny
fields
lay
between
bowlders
some
of
them
were
but
a
few
inches
square
others
a
foot
several
a
yard
perhaps
i
was
interested
to
learn
if
the
little
haycocks
were
blown
away
by
the
timberline
gales
so
returned
later
not
really
expecting
to
find
them
nor
were
they
in
the
same
location
but
their
owners
not
the
wind
had
moved
them
evidently
as
soon
as
the
hay
was
cured
it
was
stored
for
usually
beneath
the
overhang
of
a
rock
away
from
the
wind
i
was
then
curious
to
see
how
the
cony
would
transport
his
hay
in
winter
many
of
his
passages
would
at
that
season
be
filled
with
snow
forcing
him
to
appear
on
the
surface
where
the
wind
was
often
strong
enough
to
blow
me
over
to
say
nothing
of
what
it
would
do
to
the
little
midget
in
fur
with
a
load
of
hay
attached
he
met
the
storm
situation
easily
whenever
he
exhausted
one
hayloft
he
moved
his
home
to
another
thus
he
solved
the
transportation
question
and
gained
a
new
home
at
the
same
time
several
times
upon
digging
beneath
the
slide
rock
i
discovered
cony
dens
merely
openings
far
down
between
the
jumbled
rocks
beyond
the
reach
of
wind
and
weather
they
were
of
great
variety
large
small
wide
narrow
all
ready
to
move
into
they
were
the
conies
castles
ready
refuges
from
enemies
their
devious
passages
as
effective
as
drawbridge
or
portcullis
the
cony
is
something
like
the
heaver
far
down
on
the
flats
below
working
at
top
speed
when
he
does
work
and
then
resting
for
many
months
outside
the
brief
harvest
period
i
have
found
him
sitting
idly
atop
a
rock
napping
in
the
sun
dreaming
apparently
thus
for
days
and
months
he
is
idle
always
harmless
a
condition
that
does
not
apply
to
human
beings
under
similar
circumstances
he
is
energetic
ambitious
courageous
and
acrobatic
he
is
the
scout
of
the
mountain
top
always
alert
and
friendly
the
altitude
zone
of
the
cony
i
found
to
be
between
eleven
and
thirteen
thousand
feet
he
and
the
bighorn
ptarmigan
weasels
and
foxes
are
dwellers
throughout
the
year
marmots
hibernate
during
the
long
alpine
winters
but
the
cony
i
have
seen
on
sunny
days
in
january
his
welcome
piercing
the
roar
of
the
wind
has
greeted
me
on
the
lonely
heights
when
not
another
living
thing
was
in
sight
but
in
spite
of
his
living
in
the
world
the
cony
has
enemies
for
whom
he
is
always
watching
in
summer
there
are
hawks
and
eagles
foxes
and
coyotes
in
winter
his
feathered
foes
depart
but
the
foxes
remain
as
do
the
weasels
sitting
motionless
in
the
midst
of
jumbled
rocks
i
have
faded
into
the
bowlder
fields
and
thus
have
been
able
to
watch
the
cony
and
his
enemies
usually
his
announced
the
appearance
of
a
foe
before
i
discovered
it
then
if
the
enemy
was
a
bird
or
a
beast
he
merely
hugged
the
rock
watching
alertly
until
he
was
discovered
then
flipped
out
of
sight
to
the
safety
of
rocky
retreat
giving
a
defiant
as
he
went
but
if
a
weasel
appeared
i
sat
watching
a
cony
one
day
in
early
fall
as
he
lay
in
the
sunshine
upon
a
bowlder
from
somewhere
below
us
came
the
distant
of
a
relative
followed
shortly
by
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
marmot
the
cony
sat
up
suddenly
awake
and
alertly
watching
the
signals
were
repeated
instantly
the
little
fellow
departed
from
his
outpost
and
hurried
away
circling
the
bowlder
leaping
to
another
disappearing
in
the
rocks
and
reappearing
again
his
actions
were
so
unusual
that
i
wondered
what
message
the
signals
had
carried
to
me
they
were
no
different
than
they
were
when
they
announced
my
coming
yet
the
difference
must
have
been
plain
to
the
wee
furry
ears
judging
from
their
owner
apprehensive
actions
indeed
a
weasel
was
abroad
seeking
his
quarry
when
his
presence
was
announced
neither
the
cony
nor
i
could
see
him
because
of
an
intervening
upthrust
of
rock
soon
the
weasel
appeared
circling
the
rock
where
the
cony
had
been
sunning
himself
searching
beneath
it
hurrying
along
the
tunnels
through
which
the
cony
had
fled
emerging
upon
the
bowlder
he
paused
for
a
few
seconds
as
he
looked
in
all
directions
the
weasel
was
in
color
i
was
to
learn
later
that
he
changed
to
pure
white
in
winter
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
pursued
him
shouting
as
i
ran
throwing
rocks
and
attempting
to
scare
him
off
losing
track
of
both
pursuer
and
pursued
i
stopped
for
breath
suddenly
from
almost
beneath
my
feet
the
agile
villain
reappeared
staring
at
me
with
bright
bold
eyes
advancing
toward
me
as
though
to
attack
he
was
no
coward
with
amazing
agility
he
dodged
a
rock
i
threw
at
him
turning
a
and
landing
at
my
feet
for
a
moment
we
glared
at
each
other
then
he
made
off
as
though
utterly
unconscious
of
my
presence
i
watched
the
long
slender
body
disappear
among
the
rocks
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
taken
by
the
cony
standing
for
a
moment
to
regain
my
breath
and
recover
from
my
surprise
suddenly
there
was
a
shrill
whistle
behind
me
i
jumped
and
whirled
about
twenty
feet
away
a
marmot
stood
erect
atop
a
rock
eying
me
inquiringly
watching
every
movement
he
had
whistled
his
signal
about
me
whether
good
or
bad
news
i
could
not
detect
but
from
the
distance
came
other
whistles
in
reply
he
was
the
cony
ally
broadcasting
information
about
the
skirmish
taking
place
before
his
eyes
but
whether
he
was
attempting
to
interfere
and
divert
my
attention
i
could
not
make
out
certainly
though
he
was
giving
information
signaling
my
presence
to
all
within
hearing
my
intrusion
upon
the
heights
in
summer
has
ever
been
announced
by
the
conies
and
the
marmots
from
another
direction
came
a
second
whistle
apparently
i
was
surrounded
then
as
i
moved
the
second
marmot
hurried
away
from
his
observation
post
he
was
in
color
with
a
bushy
tail
and
he
ran
with
great
effort
but
with
very
little
speed
like
a
fat
boy
in
a
foot
race
down
in
the
valley
near
the
ranch
were
numerous
grouse
old
and
young
so
tame
that
it
was
like
knocking
over
pet
chickens
to
kill
them
but
there
was
a
strange
bird
above
timberline
the
ptarmigan
the
arctic
quail
of
the
north
fool
hens
the
parson
told
me
these
birds
were
mottled
in
color
matching
the
rocks
among
which
they
lived
and
so
closely
did
their
color
blend
with
their
environment
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
bird
from
rock
so
long
as
the
fowl
remained
still
it
was
because
they
depended
so
utterly
upon
their
protective
coloration
making
no
effort
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
acting
with
utmost
stupidity
that
they
came
to
be
called
fool
hens
the
days
i
spent
above
timberline
were
the
most
wonderful
of
all
from
high
above
the
world
i
could
see
tier
upon
tier
of
distant
mountains
ghost
ranges
and
southward
at
the
horizon
loomed
peak
a
hundred
airline
miles
away
a
giant
pyramid
above
the
foothills
standing
sentinel
over
the
vast
flat
plains
that
reached
to
its
foot
as
weeks
passed
and
my
interest
in
the
wild
things
increased
i
began
to
wish
for
a
cabin
of
my
own
a
home
or
a
den
to
which
i
could
retreat
and
spend
the
time
as
i
desired
wherever
i
rambled
i
was
alert
for
a
location
for
my
little
house
i
was
not
yet
old
enough
to
take
up
a
homestead
and
claim
land
for
myself
climbing
to
the
summits
of
various
promontories
i
planned
the
sort
of
cabin
i
would
like
to
build
there
i
have
a
dog
and
a
horse
too
and
a
camera
i
began
to
doubt
whether
i
want
my
rifle
for
as
i
developed
my
acquaintance
with
the
animals
i
found
myself
less
eager
to
shoot
them
hunting
and
trapping
was
the
habit
of
everyone
i
knew
even
back
in
kansas
the
boys
and
men
had
gone
shooting
at
every
opportunity
and
the
few
men
i
encountered
upon
the
trails
in
the
rockies
were
for
the
most
part
real
trappers
and
hunters
following
the
trade
for
a
living
they
gave
no
thought
to
the
cruelty
of
their
traps
or
the
suffering
their
operations
occasioned
it
is
not
strange
then
that
such
men
saw
no
harm
in
their
actions
for
they
considered
all
game
fair
prey
occasionally
i
left
my
gun
at
home
and
found
that
i
rambled
the
heights
above
timberline
in
a
changed
mood
from
when
i
carried
it
the
animals
were
more
friendly
perhaps
my
actions
were
more
open
and
aboveboard
my
rifle
naturally
inspired
a
desire
to
shoot
something
a
mountain
sheep
a
bear
even
the
fat
marmots
did
not
escape
my
deadly
fire
but
without
a
gun
there
was
interest
everywhere
many
times
i
laughed
at
the
antics
of
the
animals
especially
at
the
awkward
lumbering
haste
of
the
marmots
these
animals
while
very
curious
were
quick
to
take
alarm
they
would
climb
to
a
lookout
post
at
the
top
of
a
rock
watching
me
eagerly
and
whistling
mild
gossip
for
the
delectation
of
their
neighbors
who
could
not
see
me
one
day
far
skyward
i
came
upon
an
exceedingly
fat
marmot
busily
eating
grass
in
a
narrow
little
hayland
between
bowlders
he
must
have
weighed
more
than
twenty
pounds
but
this
fact
did
not
deter
him
from
adding
additional
weight
for
the
long
winter
sleep
at
best
his
active
period
was
short
his
hibernation
long
so
he
ate
and
slept
and
ate
again
through
all
the
hours
of
daylight
at
my
approach
he
reluctantly
left
off
eating
crept
up
a
rock
and
whistled
mildly
as
though
merely
curious
for
a
time
i
amused
him
by
advancing
retreating
and
circling
his
rock
suddenly
i
dropped
out
of
sight
behind
a
bowlder
instantly
his
whistle
carried
a
note
of
warning
so
long
as
i
remained
in
sight
i
was
merely
a
curiosity
but
the
instant
i
dropped
from
sight
i
became
a
suspicious
character
again
he
broadcasted
sharp
warning
to
all
within
hearing
from
near
and
far
came
answering
marmot
shrillings
and
from
near
by
a
cony
his
quick
alarm
my
reappearance
reassured
the
marmot
he
whistled
again
and
i
thought
i
distinguished
a
note
of
disgust
or
of
disappointment
this
marmot
lived
on
the
south
slope
of
the
big
moraine
that
shoulders
against
lady
washington
neighboring
peak
to
the
giant
mountain
peak
sometimes
i
found
the
fellow
saving
hay
by
eating
it
or
asleep
in
the
sun
on
an
exposed
rock
often
he
ventured
down
into
the
cañon
at
the
foot
of
the
moraine
to
investigate
the
grass
that
grew
down
there
one
day
as
i
sat
atop
the
big
moraine
i
heard
his
shrill
whistle
from
the
edge
of
the
trees
in
the
cañon
below
it
was
somehow
different
from
any
signal
i
had
heard
him
give
before
but
just
how
it
was
different
i
could
not
make
out
the
notes
were
the
same
but
the
tone
was
different
that
was
it
the
tone
had
changed
then
the
reason
for
the
difference
came
out
of
the
scattered
trees
a
grizzly
bear
stalked
deliberately
into
the
open
and
sat
down
facing
the
huge
bowlder
upon
which
the
marmot
sat
the
marmot
stood
erect
on
his
hind
legs
eying
the
bear
warily
prepared
to
dash
for
his
den
beneath
the
rock
the
instant
the
visitor
made
an
unfriendly
move
but
the
bear
was
a
very
stupid
fellow
he
took
no
note
of
the
marmot
instead
he
looked
off
across
the
cañon
swung
his
head
slowly
to
and
fro
as
though
thinking
deeply
of
something
a
hundred
miles
away
he
was
a
young
bear
with
a
shiny
new
coat
of
summer
fur
he
had
just
had
a
bath
in
the
stream
where
ice
water
gushed
from
beneath
a
snowbank
the
marmot
gave
a
second
whistle
carrying
less
fear
apparently
the
sleepy
bear
meant
no
harm
for
half
an
hour
the
marmot
watched
alertly
then
slid
down
beneath
the
bowlders
and
started
eating
from
time
to
time
he
sat
stiffly
erect
peering
suspiciously
at
the
intruder
but
since
the
bear
made
no
overt
move
he
continued
his
feeding
as
though
he
were
too
hungry
to
wait
until
his
uninvited
guest
departed
at
length
the
bear
rolled
over
on
his
back
with
all
four
feet
in
the
air
the
marmot
surveyed
the
performance
for
a
few
seconds
then
went
on
feeding
gradually
grazing
out
beyond
the
shelter
of
the
rock
beneath
which
he
had
his
den
the
bear
paid
him
no
mind
apparently
asleep
in
the
sunshine
slowly
the
marmot
fed
away
from
the
rock
the
farther
he
ventured
the
more
luxuriant
his
feast
for
the
grass
was
eaten
off
short
around
his
dooryard
for
an
hour
i
watched
every
move
of
that
silent
drama
trying
to
guess
the
outcome
wondering
if
the
bear
were
really
asleep
all
at
once
the
little
gourmand
whistled
reassuringly
all
right
it
a
friend
the
marmot
was
not
more
surprised
than
myself
at
what
happened
next
the
bear
lay
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
from
the
marmot
home
and
the
marmot
had
fed
perhaps
forty
feet
from
it
a
distance
he
could
quickly
cover
if
the
visitor
showed
unfriendly
symptoms
but
there
were
no
symptoms
it
was
all
over
so
quickly
that
i
was
left
dazed
and
breathless
there
was
a
small
bowlder
about
four
feet
high
in
the
midst
of
a
tiny
hayfield
where
the
marmot
fed
the
unsuspecting
whistler
fed
into
the
little
field
passed
behind
the
rock
and
was
out
of
sight
for
just
a
second
at
that
instant
the
bear
came
to
life
leaped
to
his
feet
and
dashed
toward
the
den
beneath
the
rock
cutting
off
the
marmot
retreat
too
late
the
quarry
saw
the
bear
it
made
a
frantic
dash
for
home
and
shelter
its
fat
body
working
desperately
its
short
legs
flying
ten
feet
from
the
den
the
bear
flattened
the
marmot
with
a
single
quick
slap
of
his
paw
then
he
sat
down
to
eat
his
dinner
his
acting
had
been
perfect
he
had
fooled
me
as
well
as
the
marmot
chapter
three
first
camp
alone
exploring
my
short
trips
into
the
wilds
tempted
me
to
go
beyond
the
trails
so
far
my
rambles
had
taken
me
only
to
the
threshold
of
the
wilderness
i
wondered
what
lay
beyond
i
wanted
to
follow
the
game
trails
and
see
where
they
led
above
all
i
was
eager
to
pit
my
scant
skill
against
primitive
nature
and
learn
if
my
resourcefulness
was
equal
to
the
emergencies
of
the
unknown
somehow
i
never
doubted
my
courage
i
simply
did
fear
as
the
short
summer
began
to
wane
i
grew
restless
september
advanced
the
aspen
trees
near
timberline
turned
to
gold
from
day
to
day
those
lower
down
turned
also
until
a
vast
richly
colored
rug
covered
the
mountain
sides
ripe
leaves
fluttered
down
rustling
crisply
underfoot
frost
cut
down
the
rank
grass
humbled
the
weeds
and
harvested
the
flowers
forests
of
spruce
and
lodgepole
were
dark
with
shadow
a
beaver
colony
returned
to
its
former
haunts
at
the
foot
of
long
peak
and
was
working
night
and
day
its
pond
of
still
water
was
glazing
over
with
clear
ice
october
came
the
nights
grew
colder
the
snow
of
early
winter
came
to
the
high
peaks
dusting
their
bare
bald
crowns
fur
ought
to
be
getting
prime
now
the
parson
said
one
day
be
better
still
higher
up
this
was
the
message
i
had
been
waiting
for
it
set
me
packing
at
once
for
i
was
going
into
wild
basin
alone
to
hunt
trap
and
explore
on
a
morning
near
the
middle
of
october
much
excited
i
set
out
for
the
land
of
mystery
ahead
lay
the
unknown
uncharted
wilds
i
could
go
where
i
chose
and
stay
as
long
as
i
wished
bold
columbus
looking
westward
i
could
not
have
been
more
thrilled
mountain
maple
beckoned
with
ripe
red
banners
the
mountains
peeked
through
the
autumn
haze
divulging
nothing
promising
everything
my
outfit
consisted
of
an
old
ragged
tent
a
little
food
a
camera
that
had
been
through
a
fire
and
leaked
light
badly
a
knife
an
ax
a
and
an
old
rifle
that
had
been
traded
about
among
the
early
settlers
and
had
known
many
owners
in
addition
i
had
bought
six
steel
traps
sufficiently
large
to
hold
beaver
coyotes
or
wolves
the
pair
of
ragged
blankets
that
had
served
me
on
my
short
trips
about
the
region
had
been
reinforced
with
an
old
quilt
faded
and
patched
but
sweet
and
clean
all
this
duffle
i
packed
upon
a
return
horse
lent
me
by
the
parson
one
that
would
return
home
as
soon
as
it
was
let
loose
the
parson
chuckled
at
the
appearance
of
my
pack
even
the
horse
turned
his
head
inquiringly
but
i
was
too
excited
to
mind
their
insinuations
as
the
sun
topped
the
mountains
i
led
the
horse
slowly
down
the
old
tollroad
toward
a
game
trail
and
swung
up
in
the
direction
of
wild
basin
deer
tracks
showed
in
the
old
road
and
in
the
game
trails
i
also
recognized
coyote
tracks
and
puzzled
over
strange
tracks
which
i
could
not
make
out
the
small
streams
i
crossed
had
many
deep
pools
where
trout
were
collecting
for
the
winter
i
tossed
stones
into
them
and
the
fish
like
rainbow
darts
dashed
for
shelter
beneath
the
rocks
hourly
my
excitement
grew
a
million
plans
ran
through
my
head
i
would
become
a
mighty
hunter
and
make
a
fortune
trapping
i
would
turn
prospector
and
locate
a
mine
father
and
mother
would
yet
have
the
gold
of
which
they
were
thwarted
the
second
evening
brought
me
into
such
rough
country
that
going
farther
with
the
horse
was
next
to
impossible
with
excited
hands
i
unpacked
bade
the
beast
and
started
him
toward
home
on
the
back
trail
he
trotted
off
neighing
eagerly
save
for
the
rumble
of
the
river
deep
down
in
its
cañon
the
great
basin
was
voiceless
the
forest
showed
no
signs
of
man
above
and
beyond
rose
a
circle
of
peaks
i
paused
in
awe
the
world
was
bigger
than
i
had
dreamed
i
was
a
boy
without
a
skill
a
boy
alone
in
the
heart
of
an
overwhelming
silence
i
turned
with
a
pang
of
homesickness
just
in
time
to
see
the
return
horse
disappear
whistling
loudly
i
set
about
making
camp
it
should
be
my
headquarters
from
which
i
could
explore
in
all
directions
returning
as
often
as
necessary
for
supplies
a
lake
with
sandy
shores
lapped
in
and
out
among
immense
bowlders
on
the
west
side
a
cliff
rose
straight
from
the
water
at
the
upper
edge
a
small
cataract
came
leaping
down
the
ledges
and
plunged
noisily
into
the
pool
that
overflowed
into
the
lake
above
the
water
was
a
grove
of
engelmann
spruces
giant
trees
that
rose
straight
for
more
than
a
hundred
feet
i
pitched
my
tent
in
a
small
open
glade
but
had
trouble
getting
down
the
stakes
for
everywhere
was
granite
the
first
test
of
my
resourcefulness
had
come
i
met
it
by
piling
stones
around
the
tent
stakes
bracing
them
taut
for
the
ropes
the
call
of
the
wild
was
too
loud
to
ignore
i
hastened
my
camp
making
the
sun
was
going
down
on
a
world
of
splendor
overhead
were
brilliantly
colored
clouds
while
deep
in
the
cañon
below
the
early
darkness
was
thickening
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
the
cry
of
an
animal
camp
was
left
unfinished
i
climbed
to
a
jutting
shoulder
that
overlooked
the
cañon
from
far
below
came
the
noise
of
the
river
as
it
chugged
and
sobbed
and
roared
endlessly
between
its
towering
walls
i
promised
myself
i
would
go
down
and
explore
that
dark
cañon
at
an
early
date
of
a
sudden
there
came
an
indescribable
unearthly
sound
that
echoed
and
reëchoed
among
the
cliffs
i
could
not
tell
the
direction
from
which
it
came
a
sudden
chill
crept
along
my
spine
my
hair
prickled
and
lifted
then
the
echoes
ceased
the
silence
that
followed
was
equally
terrifying
i
bethought
me
of
my
unfinished
camp
later
i
learned
that
alarming
sound
was
the
bugling
of
a
bull
elk
it
was
the
mating
season
as
darkness
came
on
i
ate
beans
and
bread
by
the
light
of
the
campfire
the
beans
came
out
of
a
can
so
were
well
cooked
but
the
bread
was
my
first
campfire
culinary
concoction
it
was
a
flour
and
water
mixture
plus
salt
and
baking
powder
cooked
against
a
hot
rock
it
was
smoked
black
and
cooked
so
hard
it
nearly
broke
my
teeth
besides
it
had
a
granite
finish
from
association
with
the
rock
oven
but
i
ate
it
with
boyish
relish
in
spite
of
its
flaws
my
imagination
expanded
as
i
watched
ghostly
dance
upon
the
face
of
the
cliff
the
shifting
flame
the
wood
smoke
the
silent
starry
night
swelled
my
heart
to
pride
in
my
great
adventure
i
ignored
the
incident
of
the
animal
cry
that
had
sent
me
scurrying
to
camp
this
first
camp
was
just
below
timberline
at
an
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
or
more
i
had
much
to
learn
about
altitude
as
well
as
of
winds
and
weather
woods
and
mountains
in
the
mountains
the
higher
one
goes
the
harder
the
wind
blows
in
the
rockies
around
timberline
gales
often
reach
a
velocity
of
a
hundred
miles
or
more
an
hour
here
during
the
long
alpine
winters
the
wind
booms
and
crashes
among
the
peaks
roars
through
the
passes
and
rips
through
the
shattered
trees
that
first
night
i
lay
in
camp
and
listened
to
its
unceasing
roar
as
it
tore
along
the
ridge
tops
occasionally
a
gust
would
scatter
my
fire
it
raged
through
the
spruces
like
a
hurricane
causing
me
much
uneasiness
lest
one
of
the
trees
should
come
crashing
down
upon
my
frail
shelter
at
last
after
dozing
before
the
dying
fire
i
went
inside
the
tent
crept
between
my
blankets
and
fell
asleep
i
was
aiming
at
a
charging
grizzly
when
there
came
a
swishing
banging
crash
i
sat
up
half
awake
the
tent
flapped
wildly
lifting
clear
of
the
ground
my
stone
cairns
had
been
jerked
down
by
the
repeated
yanks
of
the
stake
ropes
a
stronger
gust
the
tent
went
down
or
rather
up
and
vanished
into
the
night
the
spruce
tree
which
was
my
tent
pole
struck
me
on
the
head
i
sat
dazed
gradually
it
came
to
me
that
my
clothes
as
well
as
my
tent
were
gone
i
realized
too
that
i
had
pitched
camp
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
little
stream
for
the
mischievous
gusts
saturated
with
water
from
the
falls
spat
upon
me
and
soaked
my
blankets
i
managed
to
strike
a
match
but
the
wind
snuffed
it
out
instantly
i
tried
again
and
again
to
make
a
light
with
no
success
i
crawled
dazedly
about
i
struggled
upright
my
toe
caught
beneath
a
rock
and
i
pitched
headlong
that
hour
of
darkness
taught
me
never
to
venture
about
blindly
the
night
was
unbelievably
cold
during
the
day
while
the
sun
had
shone
brightly
the
temperature
had
been
very
comfortable
even
warm
but
now
with
wind
blasts
from
the
and
glaciers
and
waterfall
i
was
chilled
through
and
through
as
i
felt
about
for
my
vanished
clothes
my
teeth
chattered
soon
i
gave
up
the
search
and
sought
shelter
in
the
spruces
i
found
a
leaning
slab
of
rock
and
crept
beneath
it
as
a
wild
animal
would
have
done
through
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
i
shivered
and
shook
there
my
imagination
dulled
my
ambition
dampened
i
decided
to
break
camp
as
soon
as
it
was
light
but
it
is
marvelous
what
sunshine
will
do
when
at
last
the
tardy
sun
came
up
and
the
wind
died
down
and
i
had
recovered
my
clothes
and
warmed
myself
at
a
leaping
fire
my
heart
too
leaped
up
with
renewed
courage
all
was
serene
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
could
have
been
so
miserable
in
the
night
as
soon
as
i
had
eaten
i
dragged
the
tent
back
among
the
spruces
where
i
set
it
up
and
anchored
it
securely
lesson
number
one
had
sunk
in
it
would
not
need
repeating
when
camp
was
at
last
secure
i
climbed
slowly
to
the
ridge
top
above
its
crest
was
above
timberline
on
all
sides
rose
lofty
mountains
many
of
them
patched
with
snowbanks
deep
cañons
cut
sharply
between
the
ridges
and
shoulders
ice
fields
indicated
possible
glaciers
i
wanted
to
explore
everything
at
once
wanted
to
climb
the
peaks
and
delve
into
the
cañons
hunt
out
the
game
and
explore
the
glaciers
at
timberline
i
stopped
in
silent
wonder
broken
trees
were
scattered
about
upon
the
ground
like
soldiers
after
a
battle
i
did
quite
comprehend
its
significance
but
parson
lamb
had
described
it
to
me
i
had
seen
other
timberlines
in
my
rambles
but
none
so
impressive
as
this
here
was
the
forest
frontier
how
dauntless
how
gallant
these
pioneers
were
how
they
strove
to
hold
the
advantage
gained
during
the
brief
summer
respite
here
a
canny
stripling
grew
behind
a
sheltering
bowlder
but
whenever
it
tried
to
peep
above
its
breastworks
the
wind
with
its
of
sand
and
gravel
and
ice
bullets
cut
off
its
protruding
limbs
as
neatly
as
a
gardner
might
have
done
consequently
its
top
was
as
flat
as
a
table
in
the
open
other
trees
trailed
along
the
ground
like
creeping
vines
their
tops
pointing
away
from
the
wind
it
seemed
as
if
they
banded
together
for
mutual
protection
for
they
formed
a
dense
hedge
or
bush
here
was
the
deadline
established
by
altitude
the
forests
were
commanded
to
halt
this
line
of
last
defense
was
not
unlike
the
sweeping
shoreline
of
the
sea
here
and
there
were
lone
scout
trees
in
advance
of
the
ranks
they
were
twisted
and
dwarfed
misshapen
grotesque
there
were
wide
naked
stretches
bare
of
snow
great
drifts
lay
in
the
woods
the
deep
narrow
cañons
were
piled
full
of
it
many
of
these
drifts
would
last
far
into
the
following
summer
a
few
would
be
perpetual
at
the
approach
of
summer
such
drifts
turn
to
ice
through
frequent
thawing
and
freezing
since
the
surface
snow
melting
under
the
glare
of
the
summer
sun
seeps
down
through
the
mass
beneath
in
daytime
and
freezes
again
at
night
from
such
drifts
flow
icy
streams
for
the
leaping
trout
countless
sparkling
springs
gurgled
forth
at
the
foot
of
the
slopes
here
i
had
my
first
lessons
in
conservation
and
learned
that
it
is
indeed
an
ill
wind
that
does
no
good
here
nature
hoards
her
savings
in
snowbanks
to
these
savings
she
adds
constantly
throughout
the
winter
long
i
sat
upon
a
promontory
and
marveled
dimly
only
did
i
grasp
the
significance
of
what
lay
before
me
the
ranks
of
primeval
forest
waiting
to
aid
civilization
snow
that
white
magic
eventually
destined
to
water
crops
on
the
distant
plains
and
above
all
woods
the
final
refuge
of
the
big
game
the
sanctuary
of
the
birds
everywhere
were
scattered
unnamed
lakes
these
edged
out
and
around
the
rock
peninsulas
folded
back
into
dark
coves
and
swung
out
of
sight
behind
the
timbered
bends
some
were
almost
pinched
in
half
by
the
crowding
cliffs
till
they
formed
giant
again
they
bulged
and
overflowed
like
streams
at
high
water
i
began
to
name
them
according
to
their
shape
hourglass
of
course
the
one
that
bulged
out
at
one
end
was
surely
a
plump
pear
yes
and
my
imagination
was
recovering
for
miles
i
followed
the
strange
fantastic
timberline
occasionally
i
found
stunted
little
trees
scarcely
knee
high
peeping
through
the
crushing
weight
of
snow
that
had
smothered
them
even
throughout
the
summer
i
cut
several
trees
to
count
the
rings
of
growth
i
found
trees
growing
close
together
and
about
the
same
size
with
centuries
of
variation
in
age
one
that
had
been
broken
off
by
a
rock
slide
had
two
hundred
and
annual
rings
it
had
grown
in
a
sheltered
nook
ten
yards
away
another
much
smaller
but
growing
upon
an
exposed
rocky
point
was
no
higher
than
my
head
yet
i
counted
five
hundred
and
seven
rings
for
half
a
thousand
years
it
had
stood
at
its
post
i
found
the
counting
of
these
annual
rings
extremely
difficult
as
they
were
so
dense
that
it
was
hard
to
distinguish
them
and
they
averaged
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
rings
to
an
inch
of
thickness
but
the
small
magnifying
glass
i
carried
made
it
possible
the
most
striking
thing
i
discovered
about
the
timberline
trees
was
their
irregularity
there
was
no
similarity
of
form
as
prevails
among
trees
of
the
deep
forest
each
tree
took
on
a
physical
appearance
according
to
its
location
and
its
opportunities
one
resemblance
only
did
they
have
in
common
none
had
limbs
on
the
west
side
all
their
leafy
banners
pointed
toward
the
rising
sun
thus
i
learned
the
direction
of
the
prevailing
winter
winds
the
west
side
of
the
trees
were
polished
smooth
many
cut
halfway
through
trees
that
had
reached
maturity
or
had
died
were
stripped
almost
bare
of
limbs
which
had
been
cut
away
by
the
constant
scouring
there
were
abundant
tracks
of
deer
and
some
of
elk
but
i
saw
not
a
single
animal
near
the
spot
from
which
had
risen
the
terrifying
sounds
of
that
first
night
a
game
trail
led
down
into
the
heavy
forests
sharp
hoofs
had
cut
into
it
recently
yet
neither
hide
nor
hair
of
an
animal
did
i
glimpse
there
were
no
traces
of
beaver
nor
any
coyote
tracks
there
were
bear
tracks
but
the
small
traps
i
had
brought
would
not
hold
bear
so
i
did
not
set
them
i
was
running
low
on
provisions
for
i
had
counted
on
the
game
for
meat
i
had
meant
to
have
venison
steak
as
soon
as
i
had
got
settled
in
my
permanent
camp
here
was
mystery
my
curiosity
was
challenged
i
determined
to
fathom
it
how
i
studied
those
tracks
those
of
the
sheep
could
be
distinguished
by
the
rounded
toe
marks
of
their
hoofs
worn
blunt
by
the
granite
rocks
they
lived
on
this
was
especially
true
of
the
forefeet
they
were
also
wide
apart
while
the
deer
tracks
were
sharply
pointed
with
the
hoofs
close
together
days
passed
and
the
tracks
in
the
trails
grew
dim
but
not
before
i
had
read
their
story
i
followed
the
sheep
up
above
timberline
they
grew
plainer
and
more
numerous
so
that
was
it
the
sheep
climbed
where
the
wind
would
keep
their
tables
spread
with
sweet
cured
grass
swept
free
of
snow
and
had
placed
the
barrier
of
timberline
drifts
between
them
and
their
enemies
the
other
tracks
all
led
down
to
the
valleys
there
in
the
foothills
winter
would
be
less
rigorous
and
the
grass
would
not
be
buried
for
months
beneath
the
snow
winter
was
at
hand
in
the
high
country
and
all
but
the
bighorn
had
deserted
it
what
with
them
above
me
and
the
rest
below
i
found
myself
in
a
zone
there
was
no
repetition
of
the
frightful
sound
that
had
sent
me
scurrying
for
camp
i
suspected
a
bull
elk
had
made
it
though
i
recognized
no
resemblance
between
that
sound
and
a
bugle
my
thoughts
turned
to
other
game
i
must
have
meat
how
about
a
bear
if
i
could
trap
one
perhaps
i
could
shoot
one
i
got
out
my
battered
old
rifle
so
like
the
timberline
trees
and
boldly
set
out
for
in
and
out
of
the
dense
forest
i
blundered
crashed
through
the
tangle
at
timberline
toiled
up
the
rocky
ridges
up
and
up
i
climbed
paying
no
heed
to
the
direction
of
the
wind
i
found
bear
tracks
both
large
and
small
but
no
sight
of
bruin
himself
discouraged
i
lay
down
to
rest
and
had
a
nap
in
the
sun
later
with
the
wind
in
my
face
i
peeped
over
a
rocky
upthrust
near
a
large
snowbank
my
eyes
bulged
my
mouth
opened
there
was
a
bear
just
ahead
surely
it
was
mad
crazy
for
no
animal
in
its
right
mind
would
do
what
it
was
doing
first
it
would
lumber
along
a
few
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
snow
stopping
sniffing
striking
out
suddenly
with
its
forepaws
it
repeated
this
performance
again
and
again
i
watched
hypnotized
unaware
of
the
gun
gripped
tightly
in
my
hands
anyhow
who
want
to
eat
a
mad
bear
a
slight
sound
caused
me
to
turn
my
head
twenty
feet
away
another
bear
stood
regarding
me
curiously
not
being
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
why
i
left
my
rifle
on
the
mountainside
after
lugging
it
up
there
for
an
avowed
purpose
at
any
rate
i
made
record
time
back
to
camp
glancing
rearward
frequently
to
see
if
the
flock
of
bears
was
pursuing
me
the
next
day
after
surveying
the
mountainside
to
make
sure
that
no
bears
were
lurking
there
i
went
back
up
and
recovered
the
rifle
the
sand
beneath
the
shelving
rock
where
i
had
seen
the
second
bear
was
disturbed
claws
had
rasped
it
sharply
it
appeared
as
though
this
bear
had
been
startled
suddenly
had
wheeled
about
and
fled
for
its
life
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
i
had
taken
the
tracks
were
small
too
apparently
those
of
a
cub
this
was
my
first
hear
experience
i
had
yet
to
learn
that
bear
are
as
harmless
as
deer
or
mountain
sheep
they
attend
strictly
to
their
own
business
and
they
never
come
near
man
except
through
accident
at
that
time
though
i
was
willing
to
give
all
bears
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
the
right
of
way
while
further
exploring
the
ridge
above
the
camp
i
came
upon
an
old
abandoned
tunnel
with
its
dump
concealed
among
the
trees
below
timberline
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
had
been
timbered
to
prevent
its
caving
there
was
nothing
in
its
appearance
to
tell
how
long
it
had
been
abandoned
beside
the
dump
was
a
small
selected
pile
of
ore
this
i
gloated
over
happily
mistaking
mingled
stains
and
colors
for
pure
sold
but
if
it
was
a
gold
mine
why
had
the
owners
departed
and
why
had
they
left
rich
ore
these
and
other
questions
unanswered
left
me
with
an
uneasy
feeling
i
wondered
if
a
tragedy
had
happened
here
so
many
miles
from
civilization
with
a
torch
of
small
twigs
i
ventured
into
the
dark
hole
running
straight
back
beneath
the
cliff
a
short
distance
inside
the
tunnel
i
stopped
uneasily
the
silence
was
intense
the
twig
torch
fluttered
faintly
and
went
out
the
darkness
was
black
beyond
belief
without
delay
i
felt
my
way
out
into
the
sunshine
leaving
further
exploration
for
another
day
for
weeks
i
roamed
the
forest
circled
the
scattered
lakes
climbed
to
the
jagged
tops
of
peaks
and
daily
almost
had
new
and
strange
experiences
everything
was
intensely
interesting
and
all
was
fairyland
many
times
i
was
torn
between
timidity
and
curiosity
though
i
often
carried
the
huge
old
rifle
with
deadly
intent
i
failed
to
bring
down
any
big
game
invariably
when
i
had
a
good
chance
my
gun
would
be
at
camp
before
breakfast
one
morning
i
made
an
excursion
to
a
promontory
to
watch
the
sunrise
deep
down
in
the
cañons
below
darkness
still
lingered
slowly
the
world
emerged
from
the
shadows
like
a
photographic
plate
developing
and
disclosing
its
images
in
the
darkroom
beyond
the
promontory
a
great
spire
lifted
high
above
the
cañon
i
climbed
to
its
top
above
the
spire
was
a
higher
crag
again
i
climbed
up
up
and
up
i
climbed
until
almost
noon
each
new
vantage
point
revealed
new
glory
every
successive
outpost
lured
me
on
at
last
the
long
ridge
i
followed
shouldered
against
a
peak
of
the
continental
divide
it
was
and
hunger
urged
me
homeward
the
way
i
had
come
was
long
and
circuitous
there
was
a
short
cut
back
to
camp
but
this
threatened
difficulty
for
there
was
a
deep
cañon
to
be
crossed
and
even
though
i
reached
its
bottom
there
seemed
to
be
no
possible
way
up
the
precipitous
farther
wall
i
did
however
make
the
homeward
side
of
the
cañon
very
late
the
clouds
had
shut
down
over
the
peaks
leveling
their
tops
to
timberline
all
day
i
had
carried
the
heavy
camera
with
a
supply
of
glass
plates
besides
i
carried
my
with
belt
and
cartridges
buckled
around
my
waist
several
times
i
saw
grouse
and
fired
at
them
but
not
once
did
i
get
a
shot
as
i
toiled
upward
to
cross
the
ridge
that
overlooked
camp
i
entered
the
lower
cloud
stratum
the
air
was
biting
cold
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
a
few
feet
ahead
i
regretted
that
i
had
brought
no
food
snow
began
to
fall
and
the
higher
i
plodded
the
thicker
it
fell
darkness
came
rapidly
footing
became
precarious
the
snow
plastered
the
rocks
the
light
was
ghostly
and
unreal
i
began
to
stumble
i
slipped
and
slid
lost
my
balance
and
fell
then
as
the
snow
deepened
and
the
darkness
increased
i
realized
that
to
attempt
the
descent
of
the
slope
above
camp
would
be
folly
for
it
was
as
steep
as
a
house
roof
and
covered
with
loose
bowlders
besides
it
had
many
abrupt
cliffs
fifty
to
a
hundred
feet
high
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
camp
here
for
the
night
but
i
was
on
an
exposed
shoulder
of
the
mountain
above
timberline
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
live
through
the
night
without
shelter
and
fire
i
headed
downhill
without
regard
for
direction
i
was
becoming
numb
but
in
half
an
hour
i
safely
reached
the
dwarf
trees
at
timberline
and
plunged
through
them
to
a
dense
grove
of
spruce
occasionally
there
was
a
dead
tree
and
nearly
all
trees
had
dead
limbs
low
down
with
such
limbs
or
small
trunks
as
i
could
find
i
constructed
a
rude
with
closed
ends
with
my
pocket
knife
i
cut
green
boughs
covered
the
and
plastered
the
boughs
with
a
coating
of
wet
snow
the
green
branches
together
with
the
snow
that
was
streaming
down
like
a
waterfall
soon
rendered
the
shelter
windproof
with
a
glowing
fire
in
front
to
light
my
way
i
ranged
in
circles
for
fuel
to
last
through
the
long
night
ahead
within
an
hour
i
had
collected
a
pile
of
wood
but
i
thought
i
better
have
even
more
my
quest
took
me
farther
among
the
trees
of
a
sudden
there
came
a
whirr
of
wings
that
made
me
jump
and
drop
my
load
as
a
number
of
grouse
flew
in
all
directions
their
booming
wings
fairly
exploding
with
energy
one
of
the
grouse
alighted
in
a
tree
overhead
and
i
snatched
out
the
aimed
carefully
and
fired
it
was
a
new
experience
for
the
grouse
it
stretched
its
head
out
and
twisting
sidewise
stared
down
at
me
curiously
once
more
i
fired
the
interest
of
the
grouse
increased
again
and
again
i
fired
pausing
confidently
after
each
shot
for
the
bird
to
tumble
down
three
times
i
emptied
the
cylinder
without
a
hit
then
in
disgust
i
shoved
the
gun
back
into
its
holster
and
fumbled
in
the
snow
for
a
stone
the
first
throw
was
close
the
second
hit
its
mark
and
the
bird
came
fluttering
down
the
clouds
dropped
lower
enveloping
my
camp
the
night
was
inky
black
i
lay
beneath
my
watching
the
fire
before
which
the
plump
grouse
was
slowly
turning
round
and
round
as
it
roasted
the
turning
was
accomplished
by
hooking
a
green
twig
into
its
neck
and
tying
the
other
end
of
the
twig
with
a
string
that
wound
and
unwound
as
the
bird
alternated
directions
i
unloaded
one
of
the
revolver
cartridges
and
used
the
salty
powder
for
seasoning
my
feast
i
saved
some
ammunition
after
all
it
was
noon
next
day
before
i
reached
camp
then
the
storm
shut
down
again
snow
began
to
accumulate
in
the
woods
it
lay
knee
deep
while
the
high
ridges
above
the
timberline
were
swept
bare
by
the
howling
wind
quite
unexpectedly
in
the
dead
of
night
i
had
a
visitor
he
was
uninvited
but
was
determined
to
make
himself
at
home
awakened
by
the
rattle
of
tin
i
sat
up
listened
and
waited
i
struck
a
match
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
huge
mountain
rat
disappearing
in
the
darkness
i
had
scarcely
fallen
asleep
again
before
he
returned
and
when
i
struck
a
light
he
stared
at
me
with
villainous
beady
eyes
by
the
uncertain
light
of
a
match
i
took
aim
with
the
faithless
and
fired
when
i
sprang
up
expecting
to
find
the
mangled
remains
of
the
intruder
i
discovered
a
gaping
hole
in
my
only
frying
pan
after
an
hour
the
pest
came
again
satisfied
no
doubt
that
my
marksmanship
was
not
dangerous
this
time
i
was
prepared
for
his
coming
i
had
a
lighted
pine
torch
to
see
to
aim
by
i
tried
another
shot
the
rat
kept
moving
while
in
the
open
and
only
stopped
when
behind
shelter
peeping
out
with
one
eye
at
last
he
left
the
tent
and
i
followed
him
into
the
woods
beneath
the
overhang
of
the
cliff
he
stopped
his
piercing
eyes
flashing
in
the
darkness
as
i
advanced
with
the
torch
patiently
he
waited
beneath
a
leaning
tree
trunk
ten
feet
from
him
i
knelt
upon
the
velvet
needles
of
the
forest
and
with
torch
held
aloft
steadied
the
aimed
carefully
and
fired
at
the
shot
the
rat
disappeared
i
pressed
forward
confident
that
at
last
i
had
scored
a
hit
the
torch
had
gone
out
i
was
feeling
among
the
dead
needles
for
the
rat
mangled
body
when
my
fingers
touched
something
wooden
instantly
the
pest
was
forgotten
by
the
light
of
a
match
i
saw
that
i
had
uncovered
the
corner
of
a
little
box
it
flashed
upon
me
that
i
had
stumbled
upon
the
cache
where
the
old
prospectors
had
hidden
their
gold
they
were
gone
the
gold
was
mine
i
tugged
and
tugged
till
i
dragged
it
from
its
concealment
beneath
the
rotting
log
in
trembling
haste
i
tore
off
its
cover
then
i
staggered
back
with
a
cry
of
dismay
the
box
was
filled
with
old
crystallized
dynamite
an
inch
above
the
top
layer
of
the
deadly
stuff
was
a
fresh
hole
where
my
bullet
had
crashed
through
a
little
lower
and
it
would
have
hit
the
powder
crystals
the
next
morning
snow
lay
deep
about
the
tent
it
was
impossible
to
make
my
way
through
the
woods
i
was
marooned
far
from
civilization
the
wind
rose
crashing
among
the
peaks
tearing
along
the
ridges
roaring
through
the
passes
blinding
clouds
came
sifting
down
from
the
heights
after
days
of
patient
waiting
i
started
the
laborious
climb
upward
for
it
was
impossible
to
make
progress
downward
where
the
soft
snow
lay
now
like
the
sheep
i
would
take
advantage
of
those
stretches
above
timberline
before
dawn
i
was
on
my
way
it
required
three
hours
to
gain
the
first
mile
then
as
i
reached
the
cleared
stretches
progress
became
easier
though
the
wind
came
in
angry
squalls
that
sometimes
flung
me
headlong
and
buffeted
and
drove
me
about
the
going
underfoot
was
good
if
i
could
keep
my
bearings
and
head
northward
steer
out
around
the
heads
of
countless
cañons
hold
my
given
altitude
above
timberline
i
would
eventually
reach
a
spot
some
miles
above
the
valley
where
the
home
ranch
lay
all
day
i
plodded
the
wind
did
not
abate
but
came
in
a
gale
from
the
west
at
times
it
dropped
to
perhaps
fifty
miles
an
hour
and
again
it
rose
to
more
than
a
hundred
miles
it
shrieked
pounded
at
the
cliffs
tore
the
battered
timberline
trees
to
bits
caught
up
frozen
snow
crust
and
crashed
it
among
the
trees
like
ripping
shot
at
such
times
i
was
forced
to
turn
my
back
or
to
feel
my
way
blindly
head
down
i
moved
with
utmost
caution
lest
i
walk
over
a
cliff
the
time
came
when
i
had
to
abandon
the
heights
and
flounder
through
the
soft
snow
of
the
cañons
through
narrow
passes
i
had
to
crawl
so
terrific
was
the
wind
that
poured
through
the
channel
like
a
waterfall
nothing
short
of
a
kansas
cyclone
can
match
the
velocity
of
a
gale
all
day
i
stemmed
its
tide
which
sapped
my
strength
bowled
me
over
and
cut
my
face
as
early
darkness
came
on
i
reached
a
familiar
cañon
that
dropped
down
toward
the
valley
where
the
ranch
lay
hidden
drunkenly
i
staggered
homeward
too
exhausted
to
care
what
happened
the
last
three
miles
required
three
hours
of
heroic
work
i
became
extremely
weary
and
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
sink
down
in
the
snow
and
go
to
sleep
but
i
knew
what
that
would
mean
so
i
kept
slapping
and
beating
myself
to
keep
awake
in
the
end
i
reached
the
ranch
pounded
upon
the
door
and
when
it
was
opened
pitched
headlong
across
its
threshold
the
parson
gazed
down
at
me
from
his
six
feet
of
height
well
he
said
at
length
guess
you
found
a
pretty
big
world
chapter
four
dancing
across
the
divide
so
new
was
the
life
so
fascinating
the
animals
and
elements
of
the
primitive
world
so
miraculous
was
it
that
my
lifelong
dreams
were
come
true
that
i
never
thought
of
nor
missed
the
comrades
left
behind
me
although
the
parson
and
his
quiet
wife
were
rather
elderly
companions
for
a
youngster
there
were
too
the
diversions
of
going
for
the
mail
either
horseback
or
in
the
old
spring
wagon
behind
the
steady
little
mountain
ponies
the
swapping
of
yarns
while
waiting
for
the
generally
belated
stage
to
dash
up
its
four
horses
prancing
and
steaming
no
matter
how
cold
the
weather
from
the
precipitous
ups
and
downs
of
the
mountain
roads
they
had
traveled
the
return
journey
in
the
dusk
or
by
moonlight
was
never
without
incident
porcupine
deer
bear
bighorn
mountain
lion
some
kind
of
game
invariably
crossed
my
trail
and
as
was
true
in
all
pioneer
regions
the
community
abounded
in
interesting
personalities
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
fame
and
fairness
of
the
country
had
reached
the
centers
of
eastern
culture
and
had
lured
the
ambitious
and
the
adventurous
to
try
their
skill
in
hunting
and
trapping
and
fishing
in
this
paradise
roamed
over
by
big
game
crossed
by
sparkling
streams
alive
with
trout
kit
carson
was
the
first
white
man
to
look
down
upon
its
beautiful
valleys
others
soon
followed
joel
estes
for
whom
the
park
was
eventually
named
rocky
mountain
jim
a
man
living
alone
with
his
dogs
looking
like
a
bearded
unkempt
pirate
taciturn
yet
not
without
charm
as
later
events
proved
unmolesting
and
unmolested
enveloped
in
a
haze
of
respected
mystery
there
was
also
that
noted
lady
miss
isabella
bird
an
englishwoman
of
undoubted
refinement
highly
educated
whose
volume
a
lady
life
in
the
rocky
mountains
is
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
picturesque
accounts
of
that
time
upon
whom
rocky
mountain
jim
exerted
his
blandishments
some
sort
of
romance
existed
between
them
how
serious
no
one
knows
for
the
tragic
shooting
of
jim
by
an
irate
pioneer
father
cut
short
its
development
in
the
early
sixties
an
english
nobleman
and
sportsman
the
earl
of
dunraven
attracted
by
the
wealth
of
game
in
the
region
attempted
to
make
it
into
a
private
hunting
park
or
preserve
he
took
up
all
the
acreage
which
he
could
legitimately
acquire
in
his
own
name
then
took
up
fraudulent
claims
in
the
names
of
his
tenants
but
the
hardy
pioneers
who
were
coming
into
the
country
in
numbers
rightly
doubting
the
validity
of
his
own
ownership
of
so
many
thousands
of
acres
homesteaded
land
to
their
liking
and
built
their
log
cabins
upon
it
lord
dunraven
tried
to
scare
them
off
but
they
would
not
be
bluffed
and
in
the
contest
which
followed
he
lost
out
and
departed
from
the
region
although
his
coming
to
the
park
contributed
much
to
its
romantic
history
in
his
memoirs
two
thick
heavy
volumes
published
a
few
years
ago
he
devotes
only
half
a
page
to
his
estes
park
experiences
whether
this
is
because
he
considered
them
negligible
or
unworthy
would
be
interesting
to
know
the
old
dunraven
lodge
was
the
first
hostelry
in
the
region
and
about
the
great
fireplace
in
its
spacious
lobby
gathered
many
of
the
political
and
artistic
celebrities
of
that
day
the
fame
of
the
mountain
beauty
spot
spread
visitors
came
the
settlers
added
spare
rooms
to
their
log
cabins
and
during
the
summer
and
early
fall
took
in
boarders
thus
helping
to
eke
out
their
living
expenses
and
what
was
even
more
perhaps
the
outer
world
was
thus
fetched
in
to
them
they
heard
of
railroads
annihilating
the
long
distances
of
covered
wagon
days
of
new
gold
strikes
of
national
politics
rumblings
of
the
civil
war
slavery
agitation
presidential
elections
and
those
other
momentous
events
of
their
time
the
most
important
and
regular
social
occasion
of
that
day
was
the
community
dinner
and
literary
imagine
the
picturesque
company
congregated
from
miles
around
each
contributing
whatever
he
could
muster
of
food
and
drink
the
old
earl
of
dunraven
as
well
as
others
had
a
bar
and
seated
at
a
long
single
table
what
genuine
fun
what
pranks
what
wit
yes
what
brilliance
some
one
usually
parson
lamb
sometimes
gaunt
old
scotch
john
cleave
the
postmaster
rarely
some
noted
visitor
who
either
from
choice
or
lingered
on
into
the
winter
made
a
speech
there
were
declamations
debates
the
interminable
singsong
ballads
of
the
frontier
usually
accompanied
by
french
harp
or
fiddle
families
were
few
bachelors
much
in
the
majority
i
remember
that
at
one
of
the
community
affairs
there
were
eighteen
bachelors
out
of
a
total
attendance
of
thirty
persons
but
as
the
region
settled
up
the
bachelor
ranks
dwindled
they
like
the
big
game
disappeared
as
though
in
their
case
open
season
prevailed
likewise
i
had
attended
several
of
these
pioneer
festivities
and
had
enjoyed
them
greatly
and
was
much
impressed
with
their
importance
for
underlying
all
the
fun
was
an
dignity
seldom
found
nowadays
but
parson
lamb
told
me
these
dinners
were
tame
compared
to
a
real
mountain
dance
just
you
wait
till
you
see
a
real
shindig
he
said
then
you
have
something
to
talk
about
in
january
there
was
a
letter
in
the
mail
from
jim
oss
my
acquaintance
of
the
train
on
which
i
came
west
we
had
been
carrying
on
a
desultory
correspondence
but
this
message
was
momentous
i
am
giving
a
dance
monday
he
wrote
to
celebrate
proving
up
on
my
homestead
come
ahead
of
time
so
you
can
see
all
the
fun
his
hundred
and
sixty
acres
lay
on
the
western
slope
of
the
continental
divide
miles
away
snow
lay
deep
over
every
one
of
those
intervening
upstanding
miles
the
parson
was
concerned
about
my
going
alone
safe
to
cross
that
old
range
alone
any
time
of
year
let
alone
the
dead
of
winter
hai
no
one
else
agoing
from
here
i
inquired
but
it
seemed
there
was
not
secretly
i
was
well
pleased
to
have
it
so
i
was
young
enough
to
thrill
at
the
chance
of
so
hazardous
an
experience
parson
lamb
agreed
that
friday
morning
would
be
a
good
time
to
start
we
were
not
superstitious
and
it
was
the
thirteenth
the
trip
had
to
be
made
on
snowshoes
with
which
i
was
not
very
adept
but
that
only
added
to
its
attractions
in
order
to
cross
the
divide
it
was
necessary
to
descend
from
my
lofty
nine
thousand
feet
elevation
to
seven
thousand
five
hundred
before
starting
to
climb
flattop
trail
which
led
over
to
grand
lake
the
last
settlement
before
reaching
place
by
sundown
i
reached
a
deserted
sawmill
shack
the
last
shelter
between
me
and
grand
lake
it
was
six
miles
below
the
top
of
the
divide
and
twenty
miles
to
the
lake
there
i
spent
the
night
and
at
dawn
was
trailing
upward
in
the
teeth
of
a
gale
the
first
two
of
those
uprising
six
miles
were
fair
going
and
took
only
a
little
more
than
an
hour
thereafter
the
trail
grew
more
precipitous
the
third
mile
required
one
hour
and
the
fourth
two
hours
of
exhausting
work
the
sun
rose
but
not
the
temperature
powdery
snow
swirled
around
the
heads
of
the
peaks
clouds
swept
above
the
ridges
flayed
and
torn
from
above
timberline
came
the
roar
of
the
wind
dark
glasses
protected
my
eyes
from
snow
and
wind
and
i
was
warmly
dressed
i
left
my
bedding
roll
at
the
sawmill
to
be
picked
up
on
the
return
trip
for
shelter
could
be
had
at
grand
lake
the
light
pack
i
carried
contained
peanuts
chocolate
and
a
change
of
socks
the
higher
i
climbed
the
wilder
became
the
wind
from
timberline
i
surveyed
the
prospect
ahead
and
hesitated
clouds
and
snow
whirled
up
in
a
solid
mass
blinding
and
choking
me
the
cold
penetrated
my
heavy
clothing
i
went
on
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
turmoil
utterly
lost
buffeted
about
i
tried
to
keep
the
wind
in
my
face
for
compass
but
it
was
so
variable
eddying
from
all
directions
that
it
was
not
reassuring
near
the
top
of
the
mountain
a
blast
knocked
me
down
and
half
smothered
me
with
flying
snow
i
arose
groggily
uncertain
which
way
to
head
it
was
impossible
to
see
even
a
step
in
front
the
staff
i
carried
served
me
well
with
it
i
went
tapping
and
feeling
my
way
like
a
blind
man
there
i
was
on
the
top
of
the
world
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
sea
level
and
overlooking
nothing
flattop
mountain
is
shaped
like
a
loaf
of
bread
sloping
off
steeply
at
the
ends
its
sides
guarded
by
sheer
it
was
these
cliffs
i
feared
and
strove
to
avoid
i
had
heard
startling
tales
of
the
effects
of
high
altitude
on
one
how
the
atmosphere
was
very
rare
and
light
had
it
been
any
heavier
that
day
i
could
not
have
survived
violent
blasts
of
wind
frequently
bowled
me
over
after
one
of
these
falls
i
arose
uncertainly
drifted
with
the
wind
for
a
moment
respite
neglected
to
feel
ahead
with
my
staff
and
walked
out
upon
a
snow
cornice
that
overhung
the
top
of
the
cliff
the
cornice
broke
away
amidst
an
explosion
of
snow
i
plunged
downward
struggling
frantically
as
i
went
illustration
i
plunged
downward
struggling
frantically
i
landed
in
a
snowdrift
featherbed
which
while
it
broke
my
fall
almost
buried
me
alive
the
wind
reached
me
only
in
occasional
gusts
so
i
realized
that
i
must
be
sheltered
by
the
cliff
wall
in
the
first
brief
lull
i
took
my
bearings
i
had
landed
upon
a
narrow
ledge
a
few
feet
wide
below
me
yawned
the
gorge
it
was
a
terrible
half
work
with
a
snowshoe
as
a
shovel
to
extricate
myself
but
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
once
more
on
top
again
i
struggled
upward
i
reached
the
pass
and
started
down
the
western
slope
toward
timber
my
fingers
and
toes
were
frosted
i
was
numb
with
cold
and
so
battered
by
the
gale
i
could
only
pant
my
careful
calculations
had
come
to
naught
as
i
was
far
behind
the
schedule
i
had
planned
i
decided
to
make
up
time
by
abandoning
the
trail
and
taking
a
shortcut
to
timber
and
shelter
through
an
unknown
cañon
which
i
thought
led
to
grand
lake
but
the
cañon
was
hard
going
thick
young
evergreens
entangling
willows
and
fallen
logs
impeded
every
step
i
could
make
no
headway
and
darkness
was
coming
on
disgusted
despairing
i
took
to
the
frozen
stream
only
to
skid
over
icy
bowlders
and
at
last
to
break
through
the
ice
crust
into
the
frigid
water
long
after
dark
i
staggered
down
the
single
street
of
grand
lake
toward
a
dim
patch
of
light
it
proved
to
be
the
window
of
a
store
within
was
a
glowing
stove
surrounded
by
a
group
of
men
the
proprietor
eyed
me
with
suspicion
where
you
drop
from
i
waved
vaguely
toward
the
continental
divide
must
bin
something
urgent
to
make
you
tackle
the
flattop
trail
in
winter
he
awaited
my
explanations
curiously
but
i
had
slumped
down
near
the
stove
and
was
half
asleep
next
morning
i
looked
back
up
the
way
i
had
come
low
clouds
tattered
to
shreds
even
at
that
distance
i
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
wind
among
the
loft
crags
i
was
thankful
that
i
had
crossed
the
divide
the
day
before
it
was
still
thirty
miles
to
the
cabin
of
my
friend
but
they
were
fairly
easy
miles
compared
with
those
i
had
just
traversed
even
so
so
spent
was
my
strength
it
was
pitch
dark
when
i
dragged
wearily
up
the
broken
road
to
where
that
cabin
nestled
in
its
grove
of
spruces
the
dance
was
not
until
monday
night
so
i
took
it
for
granted
that
i
should
be
the
first
to
arrive
since
i
was
a
full
day
ahead
of
the
function
but
no
many
were
already
there
they
were
eating
supper
and
made
room
for
me
at
the
long
table
before
the
open
fire
they
were
cordial
and
made
me
feel
at
home
at
once
marveling
over
my
making
the
trip
alone
and
praising
my
pluck
i
was
much
too
weary
and
hungry
to
protest
even
though
i
had
been
becomingly
modest
seeing
this
they
filled
my
plate
and
let
me
be
turning
their
nimble
tongues
on
our
host
what
handsome
whiskers
la
la
he
better
be
careful
with
those
hirsute
adornments
and
a
cabin
with
a
plank
floor
he
hope
to
remain
a
bachelor
long
so
the
banter
ran
supper
over
and
the
dishes
cleared
away
the
candles
were
snuffed
out
and
the
company
visitors
were
never
called
guests
sat
around
the
flickering
hearth
and
speculated
over
the
possible
coming
of
the
moffat
railroad
what
an
assorted
company
it
was
young
and
grizzled
trappers
miners
invalids
seeking
health
adventurers
speculators
a
few
all
men
of
little
education
but
of
fascinating
experience
a
few
women
of
quiet
poise
and
resourcefulness
their
clothes
were
nondescript
and
betrayed
the
fact
that
they
had
come
from
the
east
having
been
sent
west
by
condoning
relatives
no
doubt
after
having
lived
in
more
fashionable
circles
there
were
two
little
children
who
fell
asleep
early
in
the
evening
in
their
parents
arms
the
company
was
put
to
bed
in
oss
house
by
the
simple
means
of
lying
down
upon
the
floor
fully
dressed
feet
to
the
fire
all
were
up
early
next
morning
and
each
found
some
task
to
do
some
of
the
men
cut
wood
and
piled
it
outside
the
door
the
women
folks
assisted
oss
with
breakfast
which
was
cooked
in
the
fireplace
for
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
luxury
of
a
cook
stove
which
would
have
to
be
fetched
in
over
sixty
miles
of
mountain
roads
and
would
cost
a
tidy
sum
besides
some
artistic
soul
with
a
memory
of
urban
ways
made
long
ropes
of
evergreens
and
hung
them
in
garlands
from
the
rafters
a
flag
was
draped
above
the
fireplace
lanterns
were
hung
ready
to
light
distant
neighbors
kept
flocking
in
all

bringing
a
neighborly

the
owner
of
an

with
finer
flavor
than
any

have
ever
tasted

by
a

vied
with
the
women
folks
when
it
came
to
cookery
the
prize
offering
however
were
some
mountain
trout
speared
through
the
ice
of
a
frozen
stream
dancing
began
early
the
music
was
supplied
by
an
fiddler
who
jerked
squeaky
tunes
from
an
ancient
violin
singing
and
shouting
the
dance
calls
by
turns
voice
fiddle
and
feet
beating
lusty
time
to
his
tunes
went
incessantly
he
had
an
endless
repertoire
and
a
talent
for
fitting
the
names
of
the
dancers
to
his
ringing
rimes
some
of
his
offerings
were

beating

with

the
men
threw
in
their
fancy
steps
their
choice
parlor
tricks
a
few
performed
a
double
shuffle
one
a
wing
a
couple
of
trappers
did
an
indian
dance
twisting
their
bodies
into
grotesque
contortions
and
every
so
often
letting
out
a
yell
that
made
one
hair
stand
on
end
there
was
little
rest
between
the
dances
for
the
old
fiddler
had
marvelous
powers
of
endurance
he
sawed
away
perspired
shouted
and
sang
as
though
his
life
depended
on
his
performance
he
was
having
as
good
or
better
time
than
anyone
with
scarcely
a
moment

breathe
he
launch
into
another

not

the

did
he
repeat

never

an

then
as
the
dancers
promenaded
he
switch
to
a
new
improvisation
ending
in
a
whirlwind
of
wit
and
telling
personalities
which
sent
the
company
into
hysterical
laughter
i
joined
in
the
dance
rather
gawkily
no
doubt
for
my
mother
father
was
a
quaker
preacher
and
we
had
never
been
allowed
to
dance
at
home
the
ladies
regarded
my
clumsiness
with
motherly
forbearance
and
tried
to
direct
my
wayward
feet
but
either
because
i
was
not
recovered
from
my
trip
or
because
the
strangeness
and
confusion
wearied
me
i
could
not
get
the
hang
of
the
steps
presently
an
understanding
matron
let
me
slip
out
of
the
dance
and
i
sat
down
by
the
fiddler
and
dozed
clanking
spurs
brilliant
chaps
trappers
jackets
thudding
moccasins
gaudy
indian
blankets
and
gay
feathers
voluminous
feminine
flounces
swinging
from
demure
basques
all
whirled
above
me
in
a
kaleidoscopic
blur
illustration
i
sat
down
by
the
fiddler
and
dozed
a
wild
war
whoop
awakened
me
nothing
but
a
little
harmless
hilarity
it
was
two
in
the
morning
i
wished
the
dance
would
end
so
i
could
sleep
undisturbed
i
envied
the
two
children
asleep
on
the
floor
but
the
dance
went
on
the
fiddle
whined
its
player
shouted
heavy
shoes
clumped
tirelessly
on
the
plank
floor
there
was
still
energetic
swing
and
dash
to
the
quadrilles
still
gay
voices
were
raised
in
joyous
shouts
those
hearty
pioneers
were
full
of
wim
wigor
and
witality
dawn
broke
redly
over
the
divide
still
the
dance
continued
daylight
sifted
over
the
white
world
and
yet
the
dancers
did
not
pause
at
last
as
the
sun
came
up
the
old
fiddler
reluctantly
stood
on
his
chair
and
played
home
sweet
home
dances
were
at
that
time
the
custom
of
the
mountain
folk
the
company
assembled
as
far
ahead
of
time
as
was
convenient
and
remained
sometimes
a
day
or
two
after
the
close
of
the
festivities
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
one
welcome
and
there
was
no
limit
to
the
length
of
his
stay
isolation
made
opportunities
for
such
social
intercourse
rare
and
therefore
everyone
got
more
kick
out
of
these
occasions
than
is
possible
in
our
swiftly
moving
blasé
age
weather
conditions
changed
while
we
danced
the
wind
eased
off
and
the
mountain
tops
emerged
from
the
clouds
and
drifting
snow
i
trailed
up
the
cañon
i
had
struggled
through
in
the
darkness
and
except
for
the
final
stretch
of
the
steep
mountain
above
timberline
the
snowshoeing
was
nothing
except
plain
hard
work
in
some
places
the
wind
had
packed
the
snow
hard
again
it
was
soft
so
that
i
sank
knee
deep
at
every
step
in
the
soft
snow
where
there
was
a
steep
slope
to
negotiate
each
snowshoe
had
to
be
lifted
high
until
my
knee
almost
touched
my
chest
the
webs
accumulated
snow
too
until
each
shoe
weighed
many
additional
pounds
but
the
fairyland
that
i
found
on
top
of
the
divide
was
worth
all
the
effort
required
to
reach
it
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
found
the
wind
quiet
every
peak
stood
out
sharp
and
clear
many
miles
away
seemed
but
a
few
minutes
walk
there
were
none
of
the
usual
objects
that
help
estimate
distance
no
horses
or
cattle
no
trees
or
trails
nothing
but
unbroken
space
the
glare
of
the
sun
was
blinding
even
my
very
dark
snow
glasses
failed
to
protect
my
eyes
the
silence
was
tremendous
always
before
there
had
been
the
wind
shrieking
and
crashing
now
there
was
not
a
sound
not
a
breath
of
wind
not
even
a
i
shouted
and
my
voice
came
back
across
the
cañon
without
the
usual
blurring
each
word
was
distinct
i
whistled
softly
and
other
echoes
came
hurrying
back
never
have
i
felt
so
alone
or
so
small
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
were
mountains
one
beyond
the
other
near
by
loomed
the
jagged
range
while
farther
down
the
divide
gray
and
terry
peaks
stood
out
then
the
collegiate
range
harvard
yale
and
princeton
in
the
midst
of
my
reverie
there
came
a
creaking
groaning
sound
from
almost
beneath
my
feet
i
had
paused
on
the
brink
of
the
same
precipice
over
which
i
had
fallen
on
my
way
to
grand
lake
before
i
could
move
the
broke
away
and
several
hundred
feet
of
it
crashed
down
the
cliff
in
places
it
appeared
to
be
ten
to
forty
feet
thick
it
must
have
weighed
thousands
of
tons
it
fell
with
a
swishing
roar
with
occasional
sharp
reports
as
loose
rocks
dropped
to
the
ledges
of
the
cliff
it
seemed
to
explode
as
it
struck
to
fly
into
powder
which
filled
the
gorge
between
flat
top
and
hallett
peaks
the
wind
had
drifted
the
snow
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
where
some
of
it
had
clung
farther
and
farther
it
had
crept
out
overhanging
the
abyss
its
great
weight
slowly
bending
the
cornice
downward
until
it
had
at
last
given
way
i
shuddered
a
little
at
the
awfulness
of
it
felt
smaller
than
ever
backed
away
from
the
rim
of
the
cañon
and
headed
for
home
chapter
five
trapping
dwellers
gold
and
fur
have
ever
been
beckoning
sirens
luring
men
into
the
unknown
as
i
have
said
the
famous
trapper
kit
carson
was
the
first
white
man
to
look
down
upon
the
picturesque
valley
later
known
as
estes
park
from
the
foothills
he
had
followed
up
one
of
the
streams
seeking
new
until
after
crossing
the
last
barrier
range
he
looked
down
upon
a
broad
river
spangled
park
set
like
a
gem
in
the
midst
of
the
encircling
peaks
of
the
divide
with
that
sheer
pyramidal
face
of
long
peak
dominating
all
we
like
to
think
that
these
early
adventurers
appreciated
the
beauty
of
the
primitive
lands
they
explored
but
whether
or
not
carson
thrilled
at
that
exquisite
alpine
panorama
he
noted
keenly
the
profusion
of
tracks
its
green
and
white
expanse
promising
an
abundance
of
game
for
he
moved
down
into
the
region
and
at
the
foot
of
long
peak
built
himself
a
rude
log
cabin
there
he
spent
the
winter
trapping
beaver
and
the
following
spring
bargained
with
the
indians
to
help
pack
out
his
catch
the
walls
the
hearth
and
part
of
the
stone
chimney
still
mark
the
site
of
that
first
cabin
i
selected
the
top
of
a
high
cliff
overlooking
these
storied
ruins
for
the
location
of
a
cabin
which
i
planned
to
build
as
soon
as
i
could
manage
it
i
too
would
be
a
trapper
and
though
the
beaver
and
other
animals
were
not
nearly
so
numerous
as
they
had
been
that
day
sixty
years
gone
when
carson
first
beheld
their
mountain
fastness
there
still
remained
enough
to
make
trapping
interesting
and
profitable
game
tracks
still
abounded
and
notwithstanding
that
i
was
a
mere
boy
inexperienced
in
woodcraft
i
could
distinguish
that
they
differed
even
though
i
could
classify
only
a
few
of
them
coyote
tracks
i
found
were
very
like
a
dog
sheep
elk
and
deer
tracks
were
similar
yet
easily
distinguished
from
one
another
bear
left
a
print
like
that
of
a
baby
chubby
foot
yes
there
was
still
a
chance
for
me
as
soon
as
i
returned
from
the
dance
at
jim
oss
i
set
about
carrying
out
my
plans
i
mushed
over
deep
snow
back
into
wild
basin
to
recover
the
six
traps
i
had
abandoned
there
on
that
memorable
first
camp
alone
and
found
my
tent
crushed
under
six
feet
of
drifted
snow
and
the
region
still
deserted
by
game
i
set
the
traps
out
in
the
vicinity
of
the
home
ranch
every
few
days
i
inspected
them
only
to
find
them
empty
indeed
over
a
period
of
long
weeks
i
caught
but
one
mink
two
weasels
and
three
coyotes
the
parson
kindly
said
the
country
was
trapped
out
still
i
suspected
my
lack
of
skill
was
responsible
for
my
scanty
catch
one
morning
in
following
up
my
trap
line
i
found
a
trap
missing
in
the
sand
about
the
aspen
tree
to
which
it
had
been
anchored
were
coyote
tracks
ignorantly
fearless
i
set
out
to
track
down
the
miscreant
the
trail
led
down
toward
a
forest
where
dense
thickets
of
pines
livened
the
stark
trees
as
i
neared
the
forest
the
tracks
were
farther
apart
and
dimmer
but
here
and
there
were
scratches
on
fallen
logs
as
though
a
trap
had
been
dragged
across
them
moreover
there
were
occasional
spots
where
the
earth
was
greatly
disturbed
showing
that
the
animal
had
no
doubt
threshed
about
in
his
efforts
to
dislodge
the
trap
caught
on
the
snags
or
bowlders
no
denying
i
thrilled
from
head
to
foot
over
the
prospect
of
meeting
coyote
face
to
face
if
he
showed
fight
i
snatch
my
from
its
holster
forgotten
was
its
faithless
performance
in
wild
basin
and
show
him
i
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
of
course
i
aim
to
hit
him
where
the
shot
would
do
least
damage
to
his
fur
it
would
be
more
valuable
for
marketing
just
then
i
heard
the
clank
of
the
trap
chain
heart
pounding
hands
trembling
i
shakily
drew
my
gun
and
cautiously
advanced
around
the
corner
of
a
bowlder
i
came
upon
a
large
coyote
with
a
black
stripe
running
along
his
back
squatting
in
an
old
game
trail
apparently
little
concerned
either
at
my
presence
or
at
his
own
dilemma
as
i
stumbled
toward
him
he
faced
about
and
without
taking
his
eyes
off
me
kept
jerking
the
trap
which
was
wedged
between
a
root
and
a
bowlder
twenty
feet
away
i
stopped
and
with
what
coolness
i
could
command
in
my
excitement
took
aim
and
fired
the
bullet
only
ruffled
the
heavy
fur
at
his
shoulder
determined
to
finish
him
next
shot
i
edged
nearer
my
target
refused
to
stand
still
he
sprang
the
full
length
of
his
chain
again
and
again
striving
to
dislodge
the
trap
finally
it
jerked
free
and
he
was
off
like
a
rabbit
despite
his
dragging
burden
leaping
logs
or
scuttling
beneath
them
zigzagging
along
the
crooked
trail
dodging
bowlders
tree
limbs
and
my
frequent
but
ineffective
fire
for
i
madly
pursued
him
though
hard
put
to
keep
up
his
pace
suddenly
the
trap
caught
again
and
jerked
its
victim
to
an
abrupt
stop
he
whirled
about
and
faced
me
defiantly
eyes
blazing
fangs
bared
i
reloaded
my
revolver
aimed
fired
aimed
fired
again
and
again
until
the
cylinder
was
empty
without
once
hitting
him
i
began
to
think
that
like
old
tom
he
led
a
charmed
life
just
then
he
jerked
loose
and
once
more
the
chase
was
on
i
reloaded
my
and
fired
on
the
run
shouting
excitedly
he
ran
on
with
tireless
automatic
motion
apparently
as
unperturbed
as
he
was
impervious
to
bullets
all
at
once
i
discovered
my
belt
empty
i
had
exhausted
my
cartridges
disgusted
i
shoved
my
gun
back
into
its
holster
and
picking
up
a
stout
club
ran
after
the
coyote
several
times
i
was
close
enough
to
hit
him
but
he
deftly
dodged
or
else
sprang
forward
beyond
reach
once
when
the
trap
caught
and
prisoned
him
an
instant
i
swung
my
club
sure
of
ending
the
race
but
it
collided
on
a
limb
overhead
and
went
wide
of
the
mark
again
i
overtook
the
coyote
as
he
struggled
through
hindering
bush
and
reaching
forward
swung
my
bludgeon
with
all
my
might
and
fell
headlong
upon
him
i
gave
a
terrified
yell
my
battered
hat
flew
off
i
dropped
my
club
the
coyote
was
out
of
sight
before
i
gained
my
feet
suddenly
we
popped
out
of
the
forest
on
the
edge
of
a
cañon
its
sides
were
smooth
and
almost
bare
on
this
open
ground
my
quarry
gained
on
me
by
leaps
and
bounds
i
spied
a
below
great
slabs
that
had
slid
down
from
the
cliff
above
between
openings
amply
large
to
admit
almost
any
animal
once
the
coyote
reached
that
slide
he
would
escape
panting
loudly
i
sprinted
forward
to
overtake
him
the
trap
chain
wedged
unexpectedly
the
coyote
changed
ends
and
came
up
facing
me
i
could
not
put
on
brakes
quickly
enough
and
skidded
almost
into
him
he
sprang
at
my
throat
as
he
launched
upward
i
glimpsed
his
flaming
eyes
and
mouth
i
do
not
know
what
saved
me
whether
my
desperate
effort
to
reverse
succeeded
whether
i
dodged
or
whether
the
restraining
trap
chain
thwarted
him
as
it
was
his
teeth
grazed
my
face
leaving
deep
red
scars
across
my
chin
his
was
the
handsomest
skin
that
adorned
the
walls
of
my
cabin
when
that
dream
eventually
became
a
reality
i
did
not
sell
the
skin
as
purposed
not
however
because
my
bullets
had
ruined
it
for
marketing
illustration
i
glimpsed
his
flaming
eyes
and
mouth
in
common
with
all
small
boys
i
was
the
hero
of
my
dreams
and
in
my
fancy
saw
myself
growing
into
a
magnified
composite
of
nimrod
robin
hood
kit
carson
and
buffalo
bill
all
molded
into
one
mighty
man
who
dwarfed
the
original
individuals
i
confess
reality
was
retarding
my
growth
considerably
it
looked
as
though
kit
carson
would
go
unrivaled
by
me
as
a
trapper
certainly
the
shades
of
nimrod
and
robin
hood
had
no
cause
to
be
uneasy
lest
i
win
their
laurels
from
them
and
as
for
buffalo
bill
both
the
buffalo
and
the
redskins
whose
scalps
had
always
dangled
in
fancy
from
my
belt
in
revenge
for
their
plaguing
my
mother
on
her
brave
drive
with
my
sick
father
across
those
long
unsettled
miles
were
far
beyond
my
puny
vengeance
the
parson
told
me
that
the
utes
a
nomadic
tribe
had
once
roamed
the
mountains
and
valleys
around
estes
but
that
it
was
not
generally
believed
that
they
had
permanent
settlements
here
it
was
thought
they
made
temporary
or
seasonal
camp
when
hunting
or
fishing
was
at
its
height
and
that
they
used
the
alpine
valley
as
a
vast
council
chamber
when
they
met
to
discuss
matters
certain
it
is
i
puzzled
over
curious
dim
ghostly
circles
or
rings
in
the
valleys
where
neither
grass
nor
any
other
vegetation
had
gained
root
even
after
all
these
years
the
told
me
these
had
been
made
by
the
indians
banking
dirt
around
their
lodges
a
few
scattered
tepee
frames
still
stood
here
and
there
in
sheltered
groves
along
the
river
occasionally
i
picked
up
arrowheads
once
upon
a
ledge
i
came
upon
a
score
or
more
how
my
imagination
soared
here
no
doubt
an
indian
had
stood
in
war
bonnet
and
full
regalia
guarding
this
pass
he
had
been
wounded
sore
unto
death
he
fell
his
bones
and
all
his
trappings
the
wooden
shaft
of
his
arrows
had
disintegrated
and
disappeared
only
these
bits
of
flint
enmeshed
in
the
clinging
tendrils
of
indian
tobacco
or
kinnikinic
were
left
to
tell
the
tale
of
his
heroism
of
course
i
did
give
up
hunting
or
trapping
or
even
my
hope
of
finding
a
gold
mine
altogether
i
continued
to
exercise
my
though
repeated
failures
to
find
my
mark
made
it
easy
for
me
to
depend
more
and
more
on
my
camera
for
shots
i
still
inspected
my
trapline
with
mental
resolutions
against
trailing
coyotes
my
trip
over
the
divide
gave
me
a
keener
appreciation
of
winter
upon
the
heights
when
from
the
window
of
our
snug
log
cabin
i
looked
up
toward
long
peak
and
saw
the
clouds
of
snow
dust
swirling
about
its
head
i
pictured
just
what
was
happening
up
there
far
more
accurately
than
i
could
ever
have
done
before
i
had
that
experience
i
made
frequent
trips
above
timberline
sometimes
to
find
arctic
gales
that
filled
the
air
with
icy
pellets
which
penetrated
like
shot
cutting
my
face
gales
that
drove
the
cold
through
the
thickest
heaviest
clothes
i
could
put
on
gales
that
blew
the
snow
about
until
it
enveloped
me
in
a
veil
making
vision
impossible
on
such
days
retreat
was
the
only
possible
if
not
valorous
course
to
have
remained
would
have
been
foolhardy
for
blinded
and
buffeted
by
the
storm
i
might
easily
have
stepped
off
a
precipice
with
less
fortunate
consequences
than
had
attended
my
experience
on
my
journey
over
the
divide
but
sometimes
the
conditions
on
the
heights
were
astonishing
once
i
left
our
valley
chill
and
gloomy
all
shut
in
by
lowering
clouds
and
climbed
up
toward
the
hidden
summits
of
the
peaks
to
emerge
above
the
clouds
into
bright
warm
sunshine
another
day
at
an
altitude
of
twelve
thousand
feet
i
found
it
only
twelve
below
freezing
while
at
the
same
time
as
i
learned
later
it
was
degrees
below
zero
at
fort
collins
a
town
forty
miles
away
on
the
plains
strange
freak
of
weather
the
explanation
lay
in
the
difference
between
the
winds
that
blew
over
the
respective
sections
a
blizzardly
north
wind
was
sweeping
over
the
low
exposed
plains
while
up
on
the
heights
a
balmy
chinook
gently
stirred
from
the
west
mountaineers
know
that
as
long
as
the
west
wind
blows
no
severe
storm
is
to
be
feared
it
is
the
chill
east
wind
that
comes
creeping
up
the
cañons
from
the
bleak
plains
and
prairies
of
the
lowlands
which
bring
the
blizzards
one
rare
windless
day
upon
the
heights
my
little
friend
the
cony
greeted
me
with
an
enthusiastic
he
was
sunning
himself
upon
a
rock
and
looked
so
sleek
and
plump
i
knew
his
harvest
had
been
bountiful
he
lay
gazing
off
into
space
apparently
contemplating
the
divide
but
when
a
few
minutes
later
a
weasel
challenged
my
right
of
way
i
wondered
whether
little
thoughts
were
so
remote
as
those
distant
peaks
in
both
storm
and
sunshine
i
saw
weasels
abroad
on
the
heights
they
were
bold
fearless
little
cutthroats
approaching
within
a
few
feet
to
stare
at
me
wickedly
i
saw
them
below
timberline
pursuing
snowshoe
rabbits
many
times
their
size
occasionally
i
came
across
fox
tracks
these
sly
fellows
seemed
indifferent
to
cold
or
wind
they
stalked
the
ptarmigan
above
timberline
and
the
grouse
that
had
migrated
up
the
slopes
to
winter
below
it
and
accounted
for
the
death
of
many
one
moonlit
night
as
i
prowled
upward
i
heard
an
unearthly
uncanny
squall
i
could
help
the
shiver
that
ran
down
my
spine
all
the
anguish
and
torment
in
the
world
broke
forth
in
that
sound
but
perhaps
it
was
only
his
foxy
protest
because
his
prey
had
outfoxed
him
but
by
far
the
most
interesting
dwellers
were
the
bighorn
sheep
which
adopted
those
frigid
regions
as
a
winter
resort
i
had
often
wondered
about
those
animals
i
had
tracked
over
in
the
wild
basin
country
were
they
still
on
those
heights
it
seemed
incredible
that
they
could
stand
a
whole
winter
of
such
bitter
buffeting
yet
on
the
days
when
i
climbed
above
the
timberline
no
matter
the
weather
they
were
always
there
contentedly
feeding
on
the
sweet
tufts
of
grass
that
the
raging
alpine
gales
kept
uncovered
it
was
fascinating
to
watch
them
neither
wild
winds
nor
blinding
snow
seemed
to
disconcert
them
their
thick
wool
coats
were
impervious
to
the
keenest
most
penetrating
blasts
true
on
terribly
stormy
days
they
sought
the
shelter
of
giant
upthrusts
of
rock
towering
cliffs
or
spires
that
faced
eastward
away
from
the
prevailing
winds
there
they
probably
stayed
for
days
at
a
time
as
long
as
the
worst
storms
prevailed
such
days
i
did
not
dare
venture
upon
the
heights
but
i
often
found
signs
of
their
bedding
down
among
similar
crags
and
such
nerveless
or
nervy
creatures
as
they
were
from
the
top
of
a
cliff
one
day
i
watched
a
band
of
them
go
down
a
nearly
perpendicular
wall
i
could
not
follow
though
i
did
go
part
way
down
to
where
the
wall
bulged
outward
there
the
ledges
had
crumbled
away
leaving
sheer
smooth
rock
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
anything
could
go
down
that
smooth
face
but
half
a
dozen
sheep
in
succession
made
the
descent
safely
as
i
watched
breathless
from
above
they
seemed
to
defy
the
laws
of
gravitation
in
walking
over
the
rim
rock
for
instead
of
tumbling
headlong
as
i
feared
they
went
skidding
downward
bouncing
twisting
and
angling
across
the
wall
like
coasters
on
snow
they
could
not
stop
their
downward
drop
but
they
controlled
their
descent
by
making
brakes
of
their
feet
and
taking
advantage
of
every
small
bump
to
retard
their
speed
by
foot
pressure
they
steered
their
course
for
a
shelving
rock
below
one
after
another
in
quick
succession
they
shot
down
struck
the
shelf
and
leaped
sidewise
to
a
ledge
a
dozen
feet
beneath
in
spite
of
their
efforts
to
retard
their
speed
they
had
gained
tremendous
momentum
before
reaching
the
ledge
and
landed
with
all
four
feet
bunched
beneath
them
it
seemed
that
their
legs
would
surely
be
thrust
through
their
bodies
their
heads
jerked
downward
their
noses
threatened
to
be
skinned
on
the
rock
yet
that
rough
descent
neither
disabled
nor
unnerved
them
they
recovered
their
balance
instantly
and
trotted
away
around
a
turn
of
the
wall
one
young
ram
thought
to
escape
by
leaving
the
cliff
and
making
his
way
across
a
steep
snowy
slide
to
another
crag
in
places
he
struck
soft
snow
and
plunged
heavily
breaking
his
way
through
midway
between
crags
however
he
came
to
grief
quite
unexpectedly
an
oozing
spring
had
overflowed
and
covered
the
rocks
with
a
coating
of
ice
then
snow
had
blown
down
from
above
and
covered
it
the
ram
struck
this
at
top
speed
and
a
moment
afterward
was
turning
somersaults
down
the
slope
a
hundred
feet
below
he
nimbly
recovered
his
balance
and
proceeded
on
his
way
carrying
his
head
haughtily
as
though
indignant
at
my
burst
of
laughter
part
way
down
the
cliff
i
found
the
tracks
of
the
big
ram
leader
of
the
band
i
had
long
since
named
him
big
eye
which
an
old
trapper
had
told
me
was
the
indians
expression
for
extraordinary
eyesight
not
that
big
eye
was
exceptional
in
this
respect
not
at
all
every
one
of
his
band
possessed
miraculous
eyesight
but
he
was
always
alert
and
wary
it
was
unbelievable
that
he
could
detect
me
such
a
long
way
off
around
bowlders
through
granite
walls
in
thick
brush
but
it
seemed
to
me
he
did
no
matter
how
carefully
i
concealed
my
approach
he
always
discovered
me
this
day
he
had
left
his
band
and
had
turned
aside
upon
an
extremely
narrow
shelf
and
made
his
way
out
of
sight
i
followed
his
tracks
curious
to
learn
where
he
had
gone
many
places
he
had
negotiated
without
slacking
his
speed
whereas
i
was
forced
to
make
detours
for
better
footing
to
double
back
and
forth
and
generally
to
progress
very
slowly
apparently
he
was
not
much
frightened
for
his
tracks
showed
that
he
had
frequently
halted
to
look
behind
him
so
intent
was
i
upon
overtaking
him
that
i
ran
into
a
flock
of
ptarmigan
and
nearly
stepped
on
one
of
the
fool
hens
before
it
took
wing
and
got
out
of
the
way
so
utterly
did
it
stake
its
safety
on
its
winter
camouflage
the
whole
flock
had
been
sitting
in
plain
sight
but
their
coats
made
them
hardly
distinguishable
from
their
background
they
faded
into
the
landscape
like
an
elusive
puzzle
picture
in
summer
they
had
depended
on
their
speckled
plumage
so
like
the
mottled
patches
of
sand
and
snow
and
grass
and
granite
whereon
they
lived
to
protect
them
they
certainly
put
their
trust
in
nature
around
a
turn
i
came
upon
the
old
patriarch
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
wall
facing
out
and
back
for
here
the
ledge
he
had
been
following
pinched
out
and
even
he
champion
acrobat
of
the
cliffs
could
neither
climb
up
nor
find
a
way
down
for
several
minutes
we
faced
each
other
ten
yards
apart
i
had
heard
that
mountain
sheep
never
attack
men
and
that
even
the
big
leaders
never
use
their
massive
battering
ram
heads
to
injure
anyone
with
this
in
mind
i
moved
up
to
within
ten
feet
when
a
movement
of
his
haughty
head
stopped
me
somehow
in
his
action
was
the
suggestion
that
he
might
forget
tradition
one
bump
of
his
huge
head
would
knock
me
overboard
there
was
nothing
but
space
for
a
hundred
feet
below
then
sheer
wall
for
several
hundred
feet
more
arrogantly
he
faced
me
unflinchingly
his
eyes
of
black
and
gold
never
wavering
statuesque
his
heroic
body
set
solidly
upon
his
sturdy
legs
his
regal
head
high
his
lodestone
feet
secure
upon
the
sloping
rock
he
was
a
handsome
figure
he
outweighed
me
about
three
pounds
to
one
so
the
longer
i
looked
at
him
the
less
desire
i
had
to
crowd
at
length
i
mustered
up
courage
to
try
him
out
slowly
an
inch
at
a
time
i
edged
forward
talking
quietly
assuring
him
that
my
intentions
were
good
and
that
i
merely
wanted
to
learn
how
near
a
fellow
might
go
without
his
lordship
taking
exceptions
suddenly
he
stiffened
half
closed
his
eyes
and
lowered
his
head
at
the
same
instant
he
shifted
his
feet
as
though
to
charge
as
i
backed
carefully
away
i
recalled
again
that
his
kind
had
never
harmed
anyone
but
i
gave
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
left
him
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
ledge
on
many
a
windy
winter
day
thereafter
i
saw
big
eye
and
his
band
always
i
laughed
a
bit
at
my
experience
upon
the
ledge
the
ram
appeared
so
dignified
so
quiet
so
harmless
still
i
had
no
fault
to
find
with
my
retreat
that
day
one
day
there
came
a
change
over
the
world
signs
of
spring
came
creeping
up
the
valley
the
pussy
willows
put
on
their
silvery
furs
the
birches
and
elders
unfurled
their
catkin
tassels
bands
of
deer
and
elk
began
to
drift
back
into
the
valley
the
bighorn
eagerly
forsook
the
heights
the
few
coyotes
that
had
remained
throughout
the
winter
were
joined
by
more
of
their
kin
fresh
bobcat
tracks
appeared
daily
the
mountain
lions
that
had
trailed
the
deer
and
elk
down
to
warmer
climes
returned
close
on
their
heels
as
their
red
records
testified
on
my
rambles
i
often
came
upon
the
scenes
of
their
kills
deer
elk
and
even
wary
sheep
were
their
victims
the
wet
clinging
spring
snows
lent
themselves
readily
as
recording
tablets
for
the
movements
of
all
the
woods
folk
not
far
from
the
proposed
site
of
my
dream
cabin
the
story
of
a
lion
stalk
was
plainly
told
by
tracks
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
rock
that
stood
ten
feet
above
the
level
floor
of
the
valley
a
huge
bowlder
that
had
rolled
down
from
a
crag
above
torn
its
way
through
the
ranks
of
the
trees
and
come
to
rest
at
last
in
the
grassy
meadow
there
he
lay
in
wait
for
the
slowly
advancing
grazing
deer
as
they
approached
the
rock
the
band
had
split
a
section
passing
on
either
side
of
the
bowlder
out
and
down
the
lion
had
leaped
ten
feet
out
and
as
far
down
his
momentum
had
overthrown
his
victim
which
had
regained
its
feet
and
struggled
desperately
the
turf
was
torn
up
for
thirty
feet
beyond
the
rock
i
found
only
the
tracks
of
the
hind
feet
of
the
lion
it
was
not
hard
to
imagine
that
his
front
claws
were
fastened
in
the
shoulders
of
his
prey
and
that
his
terrible
teeth
had
reached
an
artery
in
his
victim
neck
many
such
slaughters
the
soft
snow
revealed
aroused
by
them
i
determined
to
revenge
the
shy
innocent
deer
family
at
every
opportunity
i
have
taken
toll
of
the
lion
tribe
as
soon
as
the
first
new
grass
painted
the
meadows
pale
green
the
sheep
flocked
down
from
their
lofty
winter
resort
the
sunshine
in
the
valley
was
hot
they
still
wore
their
heavy
winter
coats
they
grew
lazy
hours
on
end
they
lay
dozing
or
moving
tranquilly
about
feasting
on
the
succulent
young
shoots
for
six
or
seven
months
it
was
at
least
that
long
ago
since
my
discovery
of
their
uprising
migration
in
wild
basin
they
had
been
living
on
dried
fare
unbaled
hay
with
no
water
to
wash
it
down
for
there
were
no
flowing
springs
about
their
airy
castles
snow
was
the
only
moisture
to
be
had
i
was
all
eagerness
to
shoot
them
with
my
camera
i
had
watched
them
so
often
i
felt
we
were
at
least
acquainted
but
out
of
respect
for
their
tremendous
dignity
i
decided
to
keep
my
plans
secret
from
them
to
approach
under
cover
to
creep
forward
cautiously
soundlessly
to
my
dismay
as
soon
as
i
got
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
them
some
busybody
of
a
sentinel
would
see
me
and
if
i
continued
advancing
no
matter
how
stealthily
the
flock
would
move
away
it
seemed
offish
not
to
say
unfriendly
time
and
again
i
tried
the
same
tactics
with
the
same
result
i
was
disappointed
and
puzzled
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
had
presumed
too
much
on
our
previous
friendship
that
such
regal
creatures
could
not
be
expected
to
capitulate
after
a
brief
winter
acquaintance
i
would
visit
them
in
their
little
valley
learn
their
peculiarities
who
would
do
less
to
gain
a
friend
worth
while
and
gain
their
confidence
accordingly
every
day
i
strolled
casually
in
plain
sight
over
toward
their
feeding
ground
they
gradually
lost
their
nervousness
at
my
advances
and
eventually
let
me
come
within
a
hundred
feet
of
them
one
morning
after
several
weeks
of
this
chivalrous
conduct
i
set
out
with
my
camera
to
spend
the
day
with
them
not
that
they
had
extended
an
invitation
but
they
unconsciously
invited
me
there
were
of
them
including
two
huge
old
rams
grazing
at
the
edge
of
the
valley
i
approached
them
from
the
windward
side
so
they
would
be
doubly
sure
of
my
identity
for
i
knew
that
with
their
telescopic
eyes
they
would
recognize
me
while
i
was
still
a
long
way
off
i
halted
first
while
about
a
hundred
yards
distant
pausing
a
few
moments
i
advanced
again
until
i
cut
the
distance
between
us
in
half
i
affected
the
utmost
indifference
i
lay
down
to
rest
i
got
up
and
prowled
about
they
left
off
feeding
and
bunched
together
the
wary
old
rams
on
the
far
side
of
the
flock
they
gallantly
let
the
ladies
and
children
be
first
to
meet
me
for
an
hour
the
game
went
on
little
by
little
i
cut
the
distance
to
thirty
feet
some
of
them
even
forgot
themselves
so
much
as
to
lie
down
and
doze
others
were
discourteous
enough
to
resume
feeding
but
a
canny
few
continued
to
watch
my
every
movement
sharply
several
times
i
tried
to
circle
round
them
each
time
they
edged
away
towards
the
mountain
slopes
at
last
they
bunched
together
beside
a
jutting
rock
and
made
such
a
beautiful
picture
i
could
no
longer
control
my
desire
to
photograph
them
setting
my
camera
at
forty
feet
i
again
slowly
advanced
at
thirty
feet
the
sheep
still
being
quiet
i
shortened
the
range
my
greediness
threatened
to
be
the
end
of
me
below
my
subjects
was
a
smooth
rock
slope
having
set
my
camera
for
feet
i
ventured
across
it
if
i
could
only
reach
the
edge
of
that
sloping
rock
before
they
took
fright
what
a
wonderful
picture
i
get
slowly
inch
by
inch
i
crept
toward
them
my
eyes
were
glued
to
the
finder
my
finger
trembled
at
the
button
all
at
once
i
stepped
out
on
nothing
boy
and
camera
turned
over
in
midair
and
alighted
amid
a
shower
of
cones
in
the
top
of
a
young
spruce
tree
after
the
first
instant
of
astonishment
my
exasperation
grew
i
had
lost
my
first
chance
at
getting
a
photograph
of
the
sheep
most
likely
the
best
chance
i
ever
have
too
maybe
ruined
my
camera
my
clothes
and
my
hide
my
disposition
was
past
mending
my
second
surprise
belittled
my
first
for
when
i
looked
about
expecting
the
sheep
to
have
vanished
there
they
all
were
crowding
forward
and
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
in
friendly
solicitude
how
often
the
unpremeditated
exceeds
our
fondest
plans
the
picture
i
finally
made
far
excelled
the
one
i
had
first
counted
on
after
my
fall
the
game
was
taken
up
again
the
sheep
moved
higher
whenever
i
came
too
near
them
sometimes
i
dropped
to
all
fours
and
gave
an
imitation
of
a
playful
pup
stopping
to
sniff
loudly
at
a
chipmunk
hole
or
to
dig
furiously
with
both
hands
the
sheep
crowded
forward
appreciatively
evidently
they
had
a
weakness
for
vaudeville
no
acrobat
no
contortionist
ever
had
a
more
flatteringly
attentive
audience
i
laughed
at
my
foolishness
but
the
sheep
were
courteously
grave
toward
noon
the
band
set
off
for
a
steep
cliff
where
each
day
they
took
their
siesta
the
two
old
rams
led
the
way
after
making
pictures
of
them
silhouetted
against
the
sky
i
circled
the
cliff
and
hid
at
the
end
of
a
ledge
i
counted
on
getting
a
good
photograph
when
the
old
leaders
surmounted
the
crag
and
marched
forward
at
the
head
of
their
column
to
deceive
them
i
built
a
dummy
at
the
spot
where
they
turned
aside
upon
the
ledge
coat
and
cap
and
camera
case
went
into
the
sketchy
figure
and
after
it
had
been
propped
in
place
to
block
the
downward
retreat
i
hurried
around
the
point
and
hid
in
some
bushes
behind
a
granite
slab
first
setting
my
camera
well
camouflaged
with
stones
atop
the
rock
and
focusing
it
toward
the
point
where
the
sheep
would
pass
in
review
minutes
passed
not
a
sheep
rounded
the
point
more
waiting
i
sallied
forth
to
reconnoiter
the
sheep
were
feeding
peacefully
in
the
valley
below
they
had
knocked
down
the
dummy
trampled
over
it
and
retreated
along
the
ledge
the
way
they
had
come
the
joke
was
on
me
but
it
had
been
a
glorious
day
for
all
that
i
retrieved
the
remains
of
my
dummy
and
started
home
i
halted
midway
down
to
the
valley
to
study
some
queer
records
in
the
sand
surely
a
crazy
man
had
made
them
what
would
a
stranger
have
thought
if
he
had
happened
upon
that
grotesque
trail
but
a
stranger
been
there
on
the
heels
of
my
crazy
trail
were
the
tracks
of
a
mountain
lion
he
had
been
stalking
me
from
my
experience
with
these
sheep
i
made
some
naïve
deductions
and
wrote
them
in
my
notebook
from
it
lying
open
before
me
now
i
transcribe
these
boyish
but
none
the
less
accurate
observations
mountain
sheep
have
eyes
therefore
one
keeps
in
the
open
at
all
times
and
never
attempts
stalking
them
under
cover
if
you
do
you
are
acting
suspiciously
and
they
will
treat
you
in
the
same
manner
they
will
not
permit
you
to
approach
from
above
them
they
are
lofty
minded
so
keep
your
place
beneath
them
if
sheep
are
in
the
open
and
on
level
ground
they
will
not
permit
a
near
approach
keep
in
the
open
below
them
permit
them
to
retreat
to
the
rocks
if
these
rocks
give
way
to
sheer
cliffs
the
sheep
will
feel
at
home
they
will
then
permit
you
to
approach
quite
near
sheep
are
tremendously
curious
take
advantage
of
this
fact
and
offer
them
something
in
the
way
of
entertainment
if
you
want
to
get
on
with
sheep
make
a
fool
of
yourself
as
spring
advanced
the
ewes
left
the
flock
and
sought
safety
among
the
cliffs
where
they
raised
their
young
in
partial
concealment
while
their
lambs
were
yet
mere
infants
a
week
old
or
so
they
hid
them
among
the
rocks
instinctively
the
youngsters
lay
low
remaining
immovable
until
their
mothers
returned
from
feeding
near
by
to
claim
them
eagles
hovered
high
overhead
waiting
to
drop
like
plummets
upon
the
helpless
babies
these
great
birds
accounted
for
many
a
bleating
little
lamb
passing
lions
likewise
visited
the
heights
and
took
toll
of
mothers
as
well
as
of
offspring
even
bobcats
pounced
upon
them
sometimes
coyotes
or
wolves
surprised
partly
grown
sheep
that
had
brashly
ventured
too
far
from
sheltering
rocks
while
returning
home
one
day
i
stumbled
upon
a
very
young
sheep
the
youngster
lay
low
like
a
wounded
duck
several
times
i
walked
within
a
few
feet
of
him
coming
closer
each
time
until
at
length
he
sprang
up
and
fled
in
terror
he
took
refuge
by
climbing
an
almost
perpendicular
cliff
wall
camera
in
hand
i
followed
as
best
i
could
fifty
feet
up
he
came
to
a
point
where
even
his
nimble
feet
could
find
no
adequate
footing
his
retreat
ended
he
scrambled
to
a
little
jutting
point
not
much
larger
than
a
hand
breadth
and
took
refuge
there
with
all
four
feet
bunched
together
carefully
i
worked
up
toward
him
several
times
he
bleated
for
his
mother
and
shifted
his
position
every
moment
i
feared
he
would
lose
his
footing
and
plunge
down
the
rock
face
twenty
feet
below
i
stopped
because
i
could
climb
no
higher
carefully
i
turned
about
and
faced
the
wall
hugging
it
as
closely
as
possible
holding
the
camera
at
arm
length
and
pointing
it
straight
up
i
sprung
the
shutter
the
click
slight
as
it
was
startled
the
lamb
he
leaped
several
feet
to
another
nub
of
rock
teetered
precariously
several
seconds
then
suddenly
his
pedestal
broke
off
sheep
and
rock
dropped
straight
toward
me
to
avoid
the
rock
i
sprang
sideways
the
sheep
plunged
down
upon
me
as
the
rock
hurtled
past
together
we
revolved
that
sheep
and
i
the
camera
being
abandoned
in
midair
to
shift
for
itself
together
the
struggling
youngster
and
i
struck
the
rock
slid
and
bounded
outward
turning
over
as
we
fell
first
one
on
top
then
the
other
until
at
length
i
clutched
a
bush
growing
out
of
a
crevice
in
the
slide
and
stopped
myself
but
the
lamb
continued
his
bouncing
fall
down
the
mountain
in
all
he
must
have
rolled
three
hundred
feet
before
he
stopped
his
feet
sticking
up
out
of
the
brush
like
the
legs
of
an
overturned
bench

sheep
and
rock
dropped
straight
toward
me
it
was
some
time
before
i
was
able
to
walk
but
as
quickly
as
possible
i
went
to
the
rescue
of
that
sheep
because
i
had
caused
his
downfall
he
was
still
breathing
but
unable
to
stand
with
great
effort
for
he
was
heavy
and
i
was
shaking
from
my
fall
i
carried
him
down
to
the
stream
and
soused
him
in
its
icy
water
he
revived
at
once
the
camera
had
smashed
to
pieces
before
it
finished
its
bouncing
flight
down
the
mountain
after
all
it
was
a
great
experience
and
though
it
cost
me
my
camera
some
of
my
hide
and
most
of
my
clothes
i
would
have
missed

chapter

a
log
cabin
in
the
wilds
primitive
living
at
last
that
day
dawned
when
my
dream
cabin
became
a
reality
high
upon
a
shoulder
of
twin
sisters
mountain
a
thousand
feet
above
the
floor
of
the
valley
where
parson
lamb
ranch
stood
overlooking
the
ruins
of
kit
carson
own
cabin
i
built
it
across
the
valley
towered
long
peak
and
its
lofty
neighbors
forty
miles
of
snowcapped
peaks
were
at
my
dooryard
and
beyond
toward
the
rising
sun
hazy
plains
stretched
away
to
the
illimitable
horizon
between
its
craggy
shoulder
and
the
main
body
of
the
mountain
lay
an
unsuspected
valley
down
which
a
little
brook
went
gurgling
there
ancient
spruce
and
yellow
pine
and
quaking
aspens
grew
in
sheltered
luxuriance
silent
valley
i
named
it
though
peaceful
or
hidden
or
happy
might
have
fitted
it
as
well
about
eighty
years
previously
as
i
calculated
by
the
age
of
the
new
trees
since
sprung
up
fire
had
burned
over
silent
valley
many
of
the
trees
were
still
standing
sound
to
the
heart
these
solid
seasoned
trunks
i
cut
for
the
logs
of
my
cabin
walls
the
parson
almost
as
excitedly
happy
as
i
lent
me
a
team
to
drag
them
to
the
spot
where
the
house
was
to
stand
they
were
far
too
heavy
for
me
to
lift
so
i
had
to
roll
them
into
place
by
an
improvised
system
of
skids
construction
was
a
toilsome
work
i
was
not
skilled
at
it
i
handled
my

squandered
much
energy

how

at

never
could
kit

nor
any
other
pioneer
have
exulted
at
his

i
did
no
wonder
the
deer
paused
in
the
aspen
trails
and
peered
timidly
out
from
their
leafy
retreat
in
amazement
no
wonder
those
sages
the
mountain
sheep
watched
from
the
cliffs
above
with
sharp
incredulous
eyes
never

the

illustration
never
before
had
the
ring
of
an
ax
echoed
in
silent
valley
my
cabin
grew
as
fast
as
young
shoulders
and
eager
hands
could
build
it
log
walls
snugly
chinked
and
log
rafters
boarded
and
sodded
two
windows
lazy
windows
we
maligned
them
because
they
lay
down
instead
of
standing
one
sash
above
the
other
and
opened
by
sliding
past
each
other
the
few
dollars
i
had
saved
from
my
original
stake
and
made
from
the
sale
of
hides
i
spent
extravagantly
it
seemed
then
for
boards
to
make
a
door
and
lay
a
floor
that
lumber
cost
nine
dollars
per
thousand
feet
on
the
job
and
had
to
be
hauled
eleven
miles
from
a
local
sawmill
an
exorbitant
price
that
made
a
lasting
impression
on
my
thrifty
mind
and
left
my
old
leather
pouch
flat
that
same
lumber
sells
for
dollars
a
thousand

of

how
fortunate
i
lived
near
your

furniture
is
nothing
new
we
pioneers
always
used
it
from
the
odds
and
ends
of
planks
left
from
the
door
and
floor
i
built
a
wall
seat
a
chimney
corner
a
shelf
cupboard
and
a
bunk
my
scanty
furnishings
were
all
homemade
a
rough
table
which
served
for
kitchen
dining
and
library
purposes
and
a
bench
which
i
always
saved
using
the
floor
before
the
hearth
instead
aunt
jane
insisted
on
giving
me
a
featherbed
to
put
on
the
rough
slats
of
my
bunk
and
some
pieced
quilts
i
used
my
camp
blankets
for
sheets
she
gave
me
too
a
strip
of
old
rag
carpet
she
had
brought
from
her
eastern
home
the
crowning
architectural
feature
of
my
mansion
was
the
corner
fireplace
raised
of
the
native
granite
bowlders
with
what
care
i
selected
the
stones
choosing
those
most
richly
encrusted
with
green
lichens
fitting
each
into
its
place
discarding
many
ranging
afar
for
others
to
take
their
place
chimney
building
is
a
job
for
an
artisan
and
even
then
much
of
a
gamble
imagine
my
delight
then
when
the
last
stone
in
place
i
built
a
fire
on
my
hearth
and
it
roared
like
a
furnace
and
all
the
smoke
went
up
and
out
the
chimney
later
the
eddying
winds
sometimes
shot
prankishly
down
it
and
playfully
chased
the
smoke
back
into
the
room
but
this
only
blackened
the
stones
giving
my
fireplace
an
air
of
antiquity
my
open
fire
was
cook
stove
as
well
as
heater
i
added
to
my
camping
utensils
a
dutch
oven
an
iron
pot
with
a
heavy
iron
lid
and
a
tin
basin
my
furnishings
were
complete
long
evenings
i
sat
on
the
floor
before
my
hearth
dreaming
sometimes
i
read
but
the
windy
days
outdoors
tramping
and
climbing
left
me
relaxed
and
drowsy
i
possessed
perhaps
a
dozen
books
among
them
treasure
island
which
i
read
over
and
over
with
my
door
bolted
my
imagination
gave
piratical
significance
to
the
sighing
of
the
pine
trees
and
the
scampering
of
the
pack
rats
over
my
roof
yes
my
dream
cabin
was
come
true
there
it
stood
on
its
lofty
vantage
watching
over
me
as
i
fared
forth
on
my
explorations
waiting
faithfully
for
my
return
never
reproaching
me
for
my
absence
its
snug
walls
always
ready
to
welcome
me
like
sheltering
arms
its
quickly
blazing
hearth
cheering
me
like
a
warm
loving
heart
so
high
was
it
perched
that
i
could
see
it
while
on
my
excursions
from
many
miles
away
it
was
a
beacon
to
my
wandering
spirit
a
compass
and
a
guide
to
my
wandering
feet
from
it
as
my
knowledge
of
woodcraft
which
i
came
to
know
was
nothing
more
than
common
sense
and
resourcefulness
applied
to
outdoor
living
increased
i
ranged
farther
and
farther
into
the
wilder
more
remote
regions
which
except
for
an
occasional
trapper
no
other
white
man
had
ever
penetrated
the
country
around
my
homestead
long
peak
and
the
adjacent
mountains
which
have
since
been
made
a
part
of
rocky
mountain
national
park
is
itself
exceptionally
high
and
rugged
there
in
a
comparatively
small
area
are
more
than
sixty
peaks
over
twelve
thousand
feet
high
long
of
course
being
over
fourteen
thousand
feet
as
the
years
passed
my
wanderings
took
me
along
the
continental
divide
from
the
wyoming
line
at
the
north
to
the
southern
boundary
of
colorado
the
vastness
of
the
rocky
mountains
is
beyond
comprehension
they
sprawl
the
length
of
the
continent
no
one
can
hope
to
see
all
their
beauty
all
their
grandeur
and
awesomeness
in
a
single
lifetime
from
the
crest
of
the
divide
north
west
and
south
stretches
a
world
of
rugged
peaks
range
on
range
tier
on
tier
like
the
waves
of
a
solidified
ocean
in
a
titanic
storm
they
roll
away
to
the
distant
horizon
shore
always
as
a
boy
that
compelling
panorama
fascinated
me
on
pleasant
sunny
days
those
rugged
slopes
from
a
distance
looked
safe
and
plushy
for
all
the
world
like
deerskin
the
dark
green
cañons
mysteriously
beckoned
to
me
the
myriad
lakes
sparkled
knowingly
intimately
the
swift
brooks
chattered
incessantly
urging
action
adventure
on
stormy
days
when
violent
winds
swept
over
the
divide
and
hid
the
heads
of
the
peaks
beneath
the
scuttling
clouds
that
overwhelming
vista
with
its
tremendous
cañons
its
towering
forbidding
cliffs
still
challenged
even
while
it
repelled
me
to
explore
every
mile
vertical
and
horizontal
of
that
uncharted
sea
of
peaks
that
was
my
boyish
ambition
that
was
what
led
me
westward
that
was
what
lured
me
on
and
on
and
my
field
of
exploration
was
limitless
one
peak
conquered
there
was
always
another
just
beyond
a
little
higher
a
little
harder
waiting
to
be
climbed
the
wilder
the
region
the
greater
was
its
fascination
for
me
no
matter
how
difficult
how
slow
my
progress
it
never
became
tedious
there
was
always
the
unexpected
the
mysterious
as
a
guarantee
against
monotony
timberline
always
interested
me
and
those
vast
naked
plateaus
above
it
never
ceased
to
move
me
to
wonder
miles
and
miles
of
great
granite
desert
into
space
the
very
of
the
world
i
used
to
marvel
that
so
much
of
the
earth
was
waste
it
was
an
everlasting
enigma
timberline
was
not
all
grotesque
trees
with
bleak
winds
forever
scourging
them
in
late
summer
it
was
a
veritable
hanging
garden
sweet
blue
and
pink
hid
in
the
moss
of
its
bowlders
edelweiss
starred
its
stony
trails
king
crown
alpine
primrose
and
many
other
flowers
nodded
a
gracious
welcome
and
just
below
it
what
a
riot
of
bloom
there
was
i
had
learned
oft
to
my
inconvenience
that
the
higher
the
altitude
the
greater
the
precipitation
around
and
just
below
timberline
are
many
lakes
and
miles
of
marshy
boggy
land
on
those
first
winter
excursions
to
the
heights
i
marveled
at
the
deep
snowdrifts
banked
in
the
heavy
englemann
forests
just
below
timberline
long
after
the
last
white
patch
had
melted
or
evaporated
from
the
exposed
slopes
these
sheltered
drifts
would
lie
undiminished
and
when
summer
really
came
they
gave
birth
to
scores
of
trickling
rills
vegetation
sprang
up
in
that
moist
soil
as
luxuriant
as
any
in
the
tropics
from
the
time
the
furry
anemone
lifted
its
petals
above
the
dwindling
snow
patch
until
the
apples
formed
on
the
wild
rose
bushes
and
the
kinnikinic
berries
turned
red
it
was
a
continuous
nosegay
indian
paintbrush
marigolds
blue
and
white
columbines
as
big
as
my
hand
and
nearly
as
high
as
my
head
fragile
orchids
hiding
their
heads
in
the
dusky
dells
thousands
of
varieties
i
never
knew
or
learned
some
few
i
recognized
as
glorified
cousins
of
my
kansas
acquaintances
the
denser
towering
spruce
forests
sheltered
them
conserved
the
moisture
and
scattered
their
needles
over
their
winter
beds
in
spite
of
the
parson
experienced
advice
on
my
first
trips
boylike
i
ladened
myself
with
blanket
roll
cooking
utensils
and
an
unnecessary
amount
of
food
i
soon
found
however
that
besides
tiring
me
early
in
the
afternoon
and
robbing
me
of
my
zest
for
scenery
my
pack
limited
the
scope
of
my
operations
for
with
it
i
did
not
dare
attempt
many
precipitous
slopes
where
a
single
slip
might
land
me
in
eternity
i
found
too
that
without
it
i
could
practically
double
the
length
of
a
day
journey
and
arrive
at
the
end
of
it
still
fresh
enough
to
enjoy
things
so
i
soon
simplified
my
camp
equipment
campfires
took
the
place
of
blankets
a
pocketful
of
raisins
a
few
shelled
peanuts
some
sweet
chocolate
bars
provided
satisfying
feasts
eventually
when
i
became
adept
at
snaring
game
i
made
a
spit
of
twigs
and
roasted
the
game
over
hot
coals
sometimes
this
primitive
method
of
camping
was
inconvenient
but
it
was
lots
of
fun
it
was
pioneering
what
boy
has
not
wished
himself
robinson
crusoe
somehow
in
this
way
i
retrieved
that
early
frontier
period
passed
before
my
birth
so
i
met
the
challenge
of
the
mountains
met
whatever
emergencies
arose
with
such
resourcefulness
as
i
could
muster
made
my
own
way
with
what
ingeniousness
i
possessed
and
lived
off
the
land
indians
could
do
no
more
having
given
up
my
gun
i
learned
other
and
for
me
at
least
more
reliable
methods
of
taking
game
for
food
setting
snares
was
an
intriguing
sport
but
when
i
did
not
have
time
for
it
i
resorted
to
a
more
primitive
method
of
course
there
were
days
when
neither
of
these
methods
succeeded
when
the
meal
hour
had
to
be
postponed
while
i
whetted
my
appetite
rather
superfluously
with
more
miles
of
tramping
i
was
surprised
to
find
i
could
go
foodless
for
several
days
and
still
have
strength
to
plod
ahead
and
maintain
my
interest
in
the
scenery
the
cottontail
of
the
rockies
is
the
commonest
and
easiest
source
of
meat
not
only
to
the
camper
but
to
the
rabbit
cannibalistic
neighbors
he
is
a
sort
of
universal
food
a
sort
of
staff
of
life
to
the
animal
world
but
for
him
famine
would
stalk
the
big
killers
fortunately
for
himself
and
for
his
preying
foes
he
is
most
prolific
and
holds
his
own
in
numbers
at
least
despite
man
and
beast
occasionally
some
ravaging
disease
carries
his
kind
off
by
the
thousands
then
starvation
faces
those
dependent
on
him
for
food
the
killers
have
to
seek
other
hunting
grounds
frequently
far
from
their
home
range
and
often
they
become
gaunt
and
lank
driven
to
take
desperate
chances
to
save
themselves
from
starvation
and
death
as
you
can
easily
imagine
it
keeps
bunny
cottontail
moving
to
outwit
his
many
enemies
he
has
no
briar
patches
in
that
rugged
country
though
the
jumper
thickets
might
serve
as
such
so
he
lives
beneath
the
rocks
usually
planning
a
front
and
back
door
to
his
burrow
in
this
way
he
has
a
private
exit
when
weasels
or
bobcats
make
their
uninvited
visitations
a
whole
rooseveltian
family
of
bunnies
live
in
congested
districts
learning
this
i
usually
set
a
number
of
snares
in
their
runways
or
at
likely
holes
beneath
the
rocks
part
of
the
game
of
making
nature
yield
one
a
living
is
keeping
an
eye
out
at
all
times
for
possible
food
supplies
if
a
rabbit
scurried
across
my
path
i
marked
the
spot
of
his
refuge
if
he
dodged
beneath
a
certain
slab
i
set
my
snare
there
then
i
poked
about
hoping
to
scare
him
into
the
snare
i
did
not
always
succeed
in
this
though
for
my
stick
could
not
turn
the
corners
of
his
burrow
and
he
often
appeared
out
of
some
other
exit
laughing
at
my
stupidity
no
doubt
sometimes
when
very
hungry
i
tried
smoking
him
out
the
stone
porch
of
his
burrow
usually
sloped
so
a
small
smudge
started
at
its
lower
side
would
travel
into
the
tunnel
rabbit
thinking
the
woods
were
on
fire
would
make
a
dash
for
the
open
and
fall
victim
to
the
snare
but
despite
the
fact
that
rabbits
are
credited
with
little
wit
i
have
often
known
them
to
nose
aside
my
traps
and
escape
cottontails
i
found
up
to
eight
or
nine
thousand
feet
but
even
higher
i
ran
across
their
cousins
the
snowshoe
he
quite
excelled
me
in
manipulating
his
webs
his
tremendous
hind
feet
with
long
clawlike
toes
covered
with
stiff
and
i
judged
waterproof
hairs
he
made
his
way
nimbly
over
the
soft
deep
snow
while
i
on
my
webs
often
floundered
and
fell
like
the
ptarmigan
and
the
weasel
the
snowshoe
rabbit
changed
to
a
white
coat
for
winter
in
the
spring
he
was
bluish
though
underneath
he
still
retained
his
arctic
snowiness
in
the
fall
with
good
taste
and
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
he
put
on
a
tan
coat
and
then
as
the
winter
snows
began
to
drift
he
once
more
donned
his
ermine
robes
grouse
were
plentiful
except
during
the
winter
months
usually
i
found
them
between
six
thousand
and
nine
thousand
feet
altitude
but
as
the
fall
coloring
painted
the
mountain
slopes
and
the
juniper
berries
ripened
they
moved
to
the
higher
exposed
cliffs
above
timberline
were
the
ptarmigan
always
easy
targets
for
a
stone
rabbits
grouse
and
ptarmigan
were
all
available
and
filling
but
the
most
abundant
and
most
easily
caught
food
in
all
the
rockies
at
that
time
were
the
mountain
trout
when
i
was
a
boy
every
stream
even
as
far
down
as
the
plains
was
alive
with
them
like
salmon
they
swam
upstream
till
they
came
to
rapids
or
cataracts
which
they
could
not
leap
those
in
the
lakes
were
exceptionally
large
but
too
well
fed
to
be
interested
in
my
bait
in
the
valleys
were
deep
pools
made
by
beavers
dams
and
in
these
the
trout
holed
up
for
the
winter
fishing
through
the
ice
was
common
sport
years
ago
i
remember
that
one
of
jim
oss
neighbors
brought
a
mess
of
trout
to
him
when
he
gave
his
homesteading
dance
in
january
with
fish
so
abundant
and
unwary
and
fishermen
few
fishing
was
easy
it
took
me
only
five
or
ten
minutes
to
catch
all
the
trout
i
could
use
usually
a
few
feet
of
line
a
hook
and
a
willow
or
aspen
rod
was
all
i
found
necessary
sometimes
i
used
bait
grasshoppers
bugs
or
worms
campfire
cooking
is
an
art
comparatively
primitive
and
elementary
but
it
requires
experience
and
intelligence
to
master
like
most
accomplishments
worth
learning
it
takes
application
and
a
world
of
patience
since
i
did
not
carry
any
utensils
with
me
i
invariably
roasted
or
broiled
the
game
i
cooked
using
hot
rocks
like
the
indians
i
heated
stones
in
my
campfire
dug
a
shallow
hole
and
when
the
stones
were
hot
lined
it
with
them
then
put
in
my
meat
covering
it
with
a
hot
flat
stone
from
time
to
time
i
renewed
the
cooled
first
stones
for
fresh
ones
hot
from
the
fire
sometimes
i
intensified
that
heat
of
my
fireless
by
covering
its
top
with
moss
or
with
pine
needles
if
i
decided
to
broil
my
bunny
or
grouse
i
got
out
my
short
fishing
line
and
tied
one
end
of
it
to
a
limb
of
a
tree
or
to
a
tripod
which
i
made
by
fastening
three
poles
together
setting
them
over
the
fire
the
other
end
i
fastened
to
a
green
stick
three
or
four
feet
long
which
i
skewered
into
the
meat
then
i
gave
my
broiler
a
spin
which
wound
up
the
line
when
it
was
twisted
tight
it
reversed
itself
unwinding
and
so
revolving
my
cookery
exposing
all
sides
to
the
fire
of
course
it
gradually
lost
its
spin
then
i
gave
it
another
twirl
given
plenty
of
time
over
a
slow
fire
of
glowing
coals
my
bird
would
be
done
to
a
queen
taste
a
much
too
delicious
dish
to
waste
on
any
king
during
dry
warm
weather
i
raked
pine
or
spruce
needles
together
for
a
bed
but
in
the
winter
i
used
green
pine
or
spruce
boughs
putting
heavy
coarse
ones
on
the
bottom
planting
their
butt
ends
deeps
in
the
snow
upon
these
i
placed
smaller
twigs
which
gave
spring
to
my
couch
and
finally
i
tufted
it
with
the
soft
tender
tips
of
the
branches
never
have
i
rested
better
on
mahogany
beds
than
i
did
on
such
pungent
bunks
lying
there
physically
weary
mentally
relaxed
drowsily
gazing
into
my
campfire
i
lived
over
the
day
adventures
and
would
not
have
changed
places
with
any
man
alive
i
found
making
camp
in
temperate
weather
was
no
task
at
all
it
was
when
it
was
cold
or
wet
that
the
real
test
of
my
woodcraft
came
i
learned
that
the
first
requisite
in
was
the
selection
of
a
suitable
camp
site
it
had
to
be
chosen
with
thought
of
the
accessibility
to
fuel
and
water
it
had
to
be
sheltered
from
the
wind
which
was
not
always
easy
to
manage
in
high
altitudes
for
though
the
prevailing
winter
wind
in
the
rockies
blows
from
the
west
it
swirls
and
eddies
in
the
cañons
coming
from
most
unexpected
and
unwelcome
directions
and
often
from
all
points
of
the
compass
in
turn
usually
camps
overhanging
cliffs
were
available
when
they
were
not
my
ingenuity
rose
to
the
occasion
and
i
thatched
together
twigs
of
willow
or
birch
or
even
spruce
or
pine
though
the
latter
were
stiffer
and
more
difficult
to
fit
tightly
together
beginning
at
the
bottom
i
worked
upward
lapping
each
successive
layer
over
the
one
beneath
as
in
laying
shingles
and
pointing
the
tips
of
the
leaves
or
needles
downward
so
they
would
shed
water
sometimes
i
had
difficulty
in
starting
my
fire
if
there
had
been
daily
showers
for
weeks
and
the
needles
and
the
deadwood
as
well
as
the
ground
itself
were
soaked
or
if
in
winter
the
deadwood
were
buried
beneath
snow
and
the
dead
limbs
of
standing
trees
difficult
to
break
off
it
was
a
discouraging
task
sometimes
after
what
seemed
like
eons
of
struggling
i
would
get
a
sickly
little
flame
flickering
when
puff
along
would
come
a
blast
of
wind
and
smother
it
out
with
snow
i
did
learn
eventually
that
pitch
knots
were
so
rich
in
gum
or
resin
that
they
would
always
catch
fire
and
so
i
shaved
off
splinters
with
my
trusty
hunting
knife
and
used
them
for
tinder
one
night
as
i
lighted
a
candle
in
my
cabin
it
came
to
me
that
a
piece
of
it
would
be
handy
to
tuck
in
my
pocket
for
emergencies
ever
afterwards
i
carried
several
short
ends
along
on
my
excursions
i
discovered
that
one
of
these
stubs
set
solidly
on
the
ground
and
lighted
would
start
my
fire
under
the
most
adverse
conditions
but
for
them
i
would
have
had
many
a
cold
camp
i
had
read
of
the
eskimo
igloos
and
i
tried
to
make
them
but
the
snow
at
hand
in
my
mountains
was
never
packed
hard
enough
to
freeze
solid
so
building
blocks
could
be
cut
from
it
it
is
blown
about
and
drifted
too
much
i
did
get
an
idea
from
buck
in
jack
london
call
of
the
wild
that
i
adapted
on
winter
explorations
i
always
carried
snowshoes
even
though
not
compelled
to
wear
them
at
the
outset
these
made
handy
shovels
when
ready
to
make
camp
i
selected
a
snowdrift
three
or
four
feet
deep
and
with
my
web
shovel
dug
a
triangular
hole
about
seven
feet
long
on
each
side
in
the
angle
farthest
from
the
wind
i
built
my
fire
it
soon
assisted
me
in
enlarging
the
corner
opposite
it
i
roofed
over
my
dugout
with
dead
limbs
thatching
them
with
green
boughs
and
finally
heaping
the
excavated
snow
over
all
i
had
a
practically
windproof
nest
which
a
little
fire
would
keep
snug
and
warm
true
i
had
to
fire
up
frequently
throughout
the
night
for
a
big
blaze
is
too
hot
in
a
but
i
soon
learned
to
rouse
up
put
on
more
fuel
and
drop
back
to
sleep
all
in
a
few
minutes
but
the
smoke
nuisance
in
my
early
dugouts
was
terrible
pittsburgh
had
nothing
on
me
many
a
morning
i
crawled
out
smelling
like
a
smoked
ham
my
eyes
smarting
my
throat
sore
and
dry
years
later
my
rambles
led
me
to
mesa
verde
and
the
kivas
of
the
cliff
dwellers
those
primitive
people
built
fires
deep
underground
with
no
chimneys
or
flues
to
conduct
the
smoke
outside
they
ingeniously
constructed
cold
air
passages
down
to
the
floor
of
the
kivas
near
the
fire
bowl
these
fed
the
fires
fresh
air
causing
the
smoke
to
rise
steadily
and
pass
out
through
a
small
aperture
in
the
roof
i
tried
this
and
to
my
delight
found
it
rid
me
of
the
strangling
plague
i
had
discarded
my
gun
but
my
camera
was
with
me
always
frequent
dashing
showers
are
common
in
the
mountains
often
too
i
had
to
cross
swollen
streams
and
sometimes
got
a
ducking
in
transit
matches
salt
and
camera
plates
were
ruined
by
wetting
so
i
had
to
contrive
a
waterproof
carrier
for
them
i
hit
upon
a
light
rubber
blanket
which
added
practically
no
pounds
or
bulk
to
my
pack
and
in
it
wrapped
my
perishables
it
saved
them
more
often
than
not
but
even
it
could
not
protect
them
in
some
predicaments
there
was
no
month
of
the
year
i
did
camp
out
naturally
i
was
caught
in
many
kinds
of
weather
in
severe
storms
i
learned
to
stick
close
to
camp
lying
low
and
waiting
for
the
furies
to
relent
in
the
early
days
as
in
my
first
camp
i
attempted
to
return
home
at
once
but
traveling
over
the
soft
yielding
snow
only
sapped
my
strength
and
got
me
nowhere
i
learned
that
by
remaining
inactive
by
my
campfire
i
conserved
both
food
and
energy
and
had
a
far
better
chance
to
reach
the
shelter
of
my
cabin
without
mishap
being
young
and
inexperienced
i
was
the
recipient
of
much
free
advice
the
most
common
being
warnings
about
the
imminent
weather
or
the
oncoming
winter
most
of
these
prognosticators
used
the
squirrels
or
the
beavers
working
busily
on
their
dams
and
houses
as
barometers
but
i
found
the
old
adage
that
only
fools
and
newcomers
could
forecast
weather
to
hold
true
in
the
mountains
i
got
so
i
did
believe
in
signs
i
saw
the
squirrels
and
the
beavers
make
preparation
for
winter
every
fall
i
took
each
day
with
its
vagaries
as
it
came
and
made
the
best
of
it
returning
from
one
of
my
midwinter
trips
to
the
wilds
one
day
i
coasted
down
a
very
steep
slope
and
shot
out
of
the
woods
into
a
little
clearing
a
snug
log
cabin
stood
there
buried
in
snow
up
to
its
eyes
in
a
snow
trench
not
far
from
the
door
an
old
trapper
was
chopping
wood
as
i
burst
upon
the
scene
he
dropped
his
ax
and
stared
at
me
then
he
found
words
see
all
fools
ai
dead
yit
he
observed
with
a
grin
then
as
i
started
on
he
yelled
after
me
but
i
bet
they
soon
will
be
illustration
see
all
fools
ai
dead
yit
he
observed
so
i
spent
the
days
of
my
boyhood
tramping
climbing
exploring
was
ever
another
mortal
so
fortunate
as
i
in
the
realization
of
his
dreams
was
ever
another
lad
so
happy
chapter
seven
glaciers
and
forest
fires
when
i
first
came
west
with
my
imagination
fired
by
the
reminiscent
tales
of
my
mother
and
my
father
and
our
pioneer
neighbors
i
looked
only
for
mountains
made
of
gold
for
roaming
buffaloes
and
skulking
savages
for
fierce
wild
beasts
and
mighty
hunters
that
the
mountains
were
golden
only
in
the
sunset
and
the
indians
and
bison
alive
only
in
the
immortal
epics
of
the
frontier
somehow
did
not
disappoint
me
so
wonderful
were
those
rocky
upheavals
in
the
reality
so
intriguing
were
the
traces
of
redskin
and
buffalo
i
forgot
my
fantastic
misconceptions
to
my
enthusiastic
youth
everything
was
extraordinary
alluring
primitively
satisfying
parson
lamb
said
the
big
game
were
gone
but
there
were
enough
left
to
give
me
many
a
thrill
naturally
at
first
i
saw
only
the
more
obvious
wonders
of
the
wilds
but
as
time
passed
i
discovered
other
sources
of
interest
hitherto
unheard
of
high
and
dry
upon
the
meadows
and
lower
mountain
sides
were
smooth
round
bowlders
undoubtedly
the
granite
walls
of
many
of
the
cañons
i
climbed
were
curiously
scored
here
and
there
were
inlaid
bands
of
varying
colored
stone
running
out
from
the
loftier
ranges
were
long
comparatively
narrow
heaps
of
earth
which
resembled
giant
railroad
fills
as
flat
on
top
as
though
they
had
been
sliced
off
by
a
titanic
butcher
knife
they
were
covered
with
forests
and
small
lakes
were
set
in
their
level
summits
at
the
foot
of
long
and
many
other
peaks
were
more
lakes
with
slick
glazed
granite
sides
the
water
in
them
was
usually
greenish
and
always
icy
there
were
immense
dirty
snowdrifts
that
never
diminished
but
appeared
to
be
perpetual
following
my
trapline
or
trailing
the
or
watching
the
beaver
i
noticed
these
things
and
wondered
about
them
how
came
those
bowlders
round
and
polished
so
far
from
water
what
made
those
scratches
upon
those
granite
cliffs
what
herculean
fused
those
decorative
belts
into
their
very
substance
what
engineer
built
those
mounds
who
had
gouged
out
the
bowls
for
those
icy
lakes
why
were
some
snowdrifts
perennial
i
puzzled
over
these
conundrums
until
bit
by
bit
i
solved
them
the
answers
were
more
amazing
than
anything
else
i
encountered
in
the
wilds
i
learned
that
those
drifts
were
not
drifts
at
all
but
glaciers
probably
the
oldest
living
things
in
the
world
for
they
were
alive
moving
deposits
of
ice
and
snow
the
survivors
of
the
ice
age
eons
ago
they
and
their
like
had
gouged
out
the
huge
bowls
which
later
became
lakes
had
gashed
the
earth
and
scoured
its
cañon
walls
leaving
in
their
wakes
those
dumps
or
moraines
debris
once
solid
granite
now
ground
into
rocks
and
sand
and
gravel
by
their
irresistible
force
most
of
the
glaciers
i
found
were
upon
the
eastern
slope
of
the
divide
this
is
because
the
prevailing
winter
winds
are
from
west
to
east
glaciers
are
formed
by
thawing
of
the
exposed
snow
on
top
of
the
huge
deposits
the
water
trickling
down
through
the
moss
and
freezing
solidly
gradually
through
continued
thawing
and
freezing
the
whole
drift
is
changed
into
a
field
of
ice
the
first
sign
of
movement
comes
when
the
mass
of
ice
breaks
away
from
the
cliffs
at
its
upper
edges
there
is
an
infinitesimal
downward
sagging
as
with
incredible
deliberation
it
moves
on
with
its
cargo
of
rock
and
sand
but
slowly
as
it
moves
its
power
is
overawing
a
glacier
is
the
embodiment
of
irresistible
force
its
roller
cuts
a
trench
through
the
very
earth
with
walls
these
latter
turn
upon
their
master
and
imprison
him
it
tears
immense
granite
slabs
from
the
cliffs
and
carries
them
along
it
grinds
granite
into
powder
i
have
seen
water
emerging
from
glaciers
with
its
load
of
rocks
by
setting
a
straight
line
of
stakes
across
the
ice
i
measured
the
movements
of
some
glaciers
some
progressed
several
feet
in
a
year
others
traveled
scarcely
more
than
a
few
inches
all
moved
farthest
nearest
the
center
for
as
is
true
of
streams
there
the
friction
of
the
side
walls
does
not
retard
them
they
varied
in
width
from
a
hundred
feet
to
half
a
mile
in
depth
from
forty
to
a
hundred
feet
during
my
first
years
in
the
rockies
the
winters
were
severe
with
heavy
snows
and
the
summers
unusually
rainy
the
low
temperature
and
great
precipitation
prevented
the
usual
amount
of
thawing
on
the
glaciers
but
there
came
a
season
as
arid
as
any
in
the
sahara
desert
it
miserable
droughty
grieved
the
parson
one
day
when
i
met
him
on
top
of
long
peak
springs
are
going
dry
and
the
streams
are
terrible
low
see
that
drift
down
there
standing
on
overtowering
summit
he
pointed
down
the
divide
the
one
with
black
rock
at
its
edge
well
sir
i
never
seen
that
drift
so
small
before
not
in
all
the
thirty
years
i
watched
it
the
glaciers
will
be
opening
up
with
all
this
hot
weather
the
crevasses
widen
and
split
clear
down
to
the
bowels
of
the
earth
wal
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
good
this
drought
will
make
it
easy
for
the
tenderfoot
to
get
a
good
look
into
i
took
the
parson
tip
and
next
day
packed
a
horse
and
started
for
arapahoe
glacier
which
lies
south
of
long
peak
on
the
second
day
out
having
taken
my
as
far
up
as
possible
i
unpacked
him
hobbled
him
and
turned
him
loose
to
crop
what
grass
he
could
find
then
i
set
up
camp
camp
made
i
began
the
last
lap
of
my
climb
up
the
glacier
along
the
way
below
snowbanks
wild
flowers
grew
but
in
the
woods
beside
the
game
trails
they
were
scarce
and
stunted
as
i
plodded
slowly
up
the
steep
slope
i
heard
loud
reports
as
though
some
one
were
setting
off
heavy
blasts
they
echoed
and
reëchoed
among
the
cliffs
a
roaring
stream
dashed
frothily
down
the
slope
rocks
rolled
past
i
climbed
a
pinnacle
overlooking
the
glacier
and
looked
down
upon
it
the
parson
was
right
all
the
snow
which
ordinarily
hid
the
icy
surface
was
melted
away
the
glacial
ice
lay
uncovered
its
surface
was
split
by
numberless
yawning
crevasses
water
drenched
their
sides
every
little
while
ice
would
break
away
and
then
reports
similar
to
the
ones
i
had
heard
on
my
way
up
would
nearly
deafen
me
i
climbed
gingerly
down
and
edged
out
upon
the
glacier
testing
each
foothold
i
peeped
into
the
crevasses
and
dropped
stones
or
chunks
of
ice
into
them
to
sound
their
depths
i
ventured
into
a
shallow
crack
and
followed
it
until
it
pinched
beneath
a
wall
of
solid
ice
then
i
tried
another
a
larger
one
gaining
a
little
courage
by
these
explorations
i
ventured
yet
farther
and
climbed
down
into
one
of
the
deeper
crevasses
water
showered
down
upon
me
from
melting
walls
above
i
crept
on
down
until
i
was
about
fifty
feet
below
the
top
of
the
glacier
i
paused
before
me
gaped
a
dark
cavern
fenced
off
by
heavy
icicles
as
large
as
my
body
i
peered
through
this
crystal
lattice
into
the
darkness
beyond
from
somewhere
came
the
tinkle
of
water
i
decided
to
investigate
a
stream
pouring
into
the
crevasse
from
above
had
washed
down
a
stone
using
it
for
a
sledge
i
set
to
work
to
break
into
that
barred
vault
i
shattered
one
of
the
glassy
bars
and
crawled
inside
a
ghostly
blue
light
filled
the
place
with
lighted
candle
i
moved
away
from
the
entrance
turned
a
corner
and
plunged
into
the
blackest
darkness
i
have
ever
experienced
the
silence
was
eerie
frightening
just
then
it
was
shattered
by
a
muffled
report
followed
almost
at
once
by
another
that
seemed
to
rend
my
cavern
walls
asunder
bits
of
ice
dropped
about
me
i
suddenly
remembered
a
number
of
things
i
wanted
to
do
outside
i
turned
and
sought
the
guarded
cavern
of
the
ghastly
light
i
mistook
the
way
and
turned
aside
into
a
blind
alley
for
a
moment
i
grew
panicky
my
flesh
went
clammy
but
that
momentary
delay
no
doubt
saved
my
life
as
i
reached
the
opening
there
came
a
rending
crash
a
splintering
of
ice
and
broken
blocks
came
hurtling
into
the
crevasse
just
outside
my
cavern
door
an
inrush
of
air
snuffed
out
my
candle
my
hands
trembled
as
i
relighted
the
candle
ice
still
bombarded
the
opening
somewhere
water
splashed
before
i
had
descended
into
the
crevasse
i
had
been
perspiring
freely
for
the
sun
shone
hot
upon
the
surface
of
the
glacier
now
i
was
shivering
my
feet
were
soaked
with
ice
water
a
dozen
little
streams
trickled
down
from
the
cavern
roof
i
would
soon
be
warm
in
the
hot
sun
outside
then
i
discovered
the
crevasse
was
blocked
with
ice
i
lost
my
head
and
shouted
for
help
there
were
none
to
hear
i
pushed
against
the
barriers
i
pulled
myself
together
and
began
to
search
for
a
passage
among
the
blocks
of
ice
the
candle
gave
a
feeble
light
without
waiting
to
feel
my
way
i
edged
into
a
crack
wriggled
forward
and
stuck
tight
cold
sweat
oozed
as
i
wiggled
backward
into
the
cavern
again
i
had
difficulty
relighting
the
candle
again
and
again
i
attempted
to
squeeze
out
among
the
pieces
of
broken
ice
i
climbed
up
the
smooth
wall
lost
my
footing
and
tumbled
back
at
last
i
found
a
larger
opening
among
the
ice
blocks
and
squeezed
into
it
like
a
rabbit
into
a
rock
pile
i
knew
i
must
hurry
because
these
jumbled
pieces
would
soon
be
solidly
cemented
together
when
the
water
pouring
over
them
froze
i
surged
desperately
against
the
pressing
ice
held
my
breath
and
squeezed
my
way
through
into
the
sunshine
at
last
safe
late
that
evening
i
reached
my
camp
my
interest
in
glaciers
chilled
since
that
experience
i
have
usually
looked
long
before
leaping
into
a
crevasse
and
then
have
not
leaped
the
next
morning
i
broke
camp
i
had
had
enough
of
of
glaciers
i
followed
the
crest
of
the
continental
divide
northward
satisfied
with
such
distant
views
of
those
treacherous
juggernauts
as
could
be
had
from
the
rim
rocks
that
was
how
i
came
to
be
camped
at
timberline
above
allen
park
when
the
big
forest
fire
set
the
region
south
of
it
ablaze
from
my
lofty
station
i
watched
a
thunder
shower
gather
around
long
peak
and
move
southward
tongues
of
lightning
darting
from
it
venomously
it
was
perhaps
ten
miles
wide
it
circled
wild
basin
then
faced
eastward
toward
the
foothills
its
forked
tongues
writhing
wickedly
those
to
the
south
struck
repeatedly
i
counted
three
fires
they
started
but
two
of
these
the
shower
extinguished
the
third
was
miles
beyond
the
edge
of
the
rain
and
began
spreading
even
as
i
watched
smoke
soon
hid
the
doomed
forest
filling
the
cañon
and
boiling
out
beyond
it
everywhere
in
the
mountains
i
had
found
forests
ancient
trees
that
had
stood
for
centuries
had
endured
drought
flood
storm
and
pestilence
only
to
be
burned
at
last
by
a
fiendish
flash
and
left
charred
skeletons
of
their
former
green
beauty
i
hurried
down
from
the
heights
as
the
fire
spread
upward
along
both
sides
of
the
gorge
upon
a
bare
rocky
ridge
several
miles
north
inside
the
edge
of
the
shower
limits
i
deposited
my
pack
and
turned
the
horse
homeward
alone
i
hoped
that
i
might
be
able
to
put
out
the
fire
before
it
spread
too
far
as
i
hurried
in
its
direction
i
saw
two
deer
standing
in
a
little
opening
watching
the
smoke
intently
they
showed
no
fear
merely
curiosity
but
as
i
approached
closer
to
its
smouldering
edge
i
met
birds
in
excited
flight
along
a
brook
i
found
fresh
bear
tracks
bruin
had
galloped
hastily
from
the
danger
zone
the
fire
was
confined
to
the
heavy
timber
near
the
bottom
of
a
cañon
but
was
licking
its
way
up
both
slopes
the
backfire
eating
slowly
downward
while
the
headfire
leaped
upward
trees
exploded
into
giant
sparklers
the
heat
of
the
approaching
flames
caused
the
needles
to
exude
their
sap
combustion
occurred
almost
before
the
actual
fire
touched
them
black
acrid
smoke
arose
visible
a
hundred
miles
out
on
the
plains
not
a
breeze
stirred
where
i
stood
but
the
fire
seemed
fanned
by
a
strong
wind
that
swayed
it
back
and
forth
it
did
not
travel
in
a
set
direction
one
moment
it
raced
westward
paused
smoldered
then
burst
forth
again
running
southward
a
little
later
a
flood
of
flame
would
come
toward
the
east
these
scattered
sorties
cut
narrow
swaths
through
the
forest
flaming
lanes
that
smoldered
at
the
edges
widened
and
combined
the
smoke
cloud
grew
denser
my
eyes
streamed
with
tears
my
throat
burned
i
began
to
cough
i
descended
the
ridge
to
cross
the
cañon
in
the
bottom
i
found
little
smoke
and
fairly
good
air
flocks
of
birds
veered
uncertainly
about
they
would
flee
the
fire
encounter
dense
smoke
and
turn
straight
back
toward
the
flames
they
circled
and
alighted
at
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
no
sooner
safely
there
then
they
take
wing
again
and
flutter
back
into
the
trees
near
the
fire
many
dropped
overcome
by
the
smoke
whole
flocks
disappeared
into
the
roaring
flames
to
return
no
more
they
lost
all
sense
of
direction
all
instinct
for
but
the
birds
were
not
alone
in
their
distress
the
animals
too
were
on
the
move
down
the
slopes
came
deer
does
with
their
young
bucks
with
tender
growing
horns
to
my
surprise
they
paid
no
attention
to
me
whether
they
were
unable
to
get
my
scent
because
of
the
fumes
of
burning
woods
or
whether
the
fire
filled
them
with
a
greater
fear
i
could
not
decide
a
coyote
trotted
calmly
down
a
game
trail
eyed
me
for
a
moment
and
went
on
his
way
toward
safety
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
wild
folk
able
to
keep
his
wits
about
him
occasionally
one
of
the
deer
would
break
away
from
the
refugees
head
up
or
down
without
apparent
reason
the
rest
of
the
band
instantly
following
his
lead
in
less
than
a
minute
all
would
return
they
feared
to
desert
their
usual
haunts
in
time
of
trouble
the
smoke
robbed
them
of
their
sense
of
smell
the
noise
of
the
fire
was
too
loud
for
their
usually
alert
big
ears
to
catch
the
smaller
significant
sounds
as
their
confusion
grew
their
terror
mounted
they
bundled
nervously
away
in
all
directions
rushing
back
together
heading
upstream
toward
the
fire
and
leaping
wildly
over
smoldering
needles
of
the
forest
floor
the
fawns
were
deserted
their
mothers
dashed
about
frantically
as
though
unable
to
recognize
their
own
offspring
they
snorted
wildly
to
rid
their
noses
of
the
biting
fumes
that
robbed
them
of
scent
a
fawn
stopped
within
a
few
feet
of
me
and
stared
about
with
luminous
innocent
eyes
its
hair
was
singed
and
its
feet
burned
it
lifted
its
left
hind
foot
and
stared
at
it
perplexed
then
i
saw
between
its
dainty
parted
hoofs
a
burning
stick
other
animals
passed
a
badger
waddled
slowly
down
the
trail
pausing
to
grin
at
me
comically
two
beavers
splashed
downstream
following
the
water
diving
through
the
deeper
pools
and
lumbering
through
the
shallows
of
the
brook
other
animals
crashed
through
the
woods
but
i
could
not
recognize
them
a
little
brook
sizzled
down
through
the
burning
land
i
stopped
and
cupping
my
hands
scooped
up
some
water
and
drank
thirstily
the
first
swallow
nearly
strangled
me
it
was
saturated
by
the
fumes
of
the
burning
forest
i
drank
on
nevertheless
it
was
wet
and
cooling
to
my
parched
throat
i
soused
my
head
in
the
brook
and
soaked
my
handkerchief
in
case
of
need
a
faint
breeze
sprang
up
circling
the
fire
i
moved
up
the
slope
with
the
wind
at
my
back
the
forest
floor
was
a
smoldering
mass
the
squirrels
hidden
hoards
were
afire
young
trees
just
starting
from
those
nurseries
were
destroyed
by
tens
of
thousands
on
raced
the
head
fire
setting
the
dead
trees
and
stumps
furiously
aflame
touching
the
needles
of
the
living
trees
with
swift
feverish
fingers
igniting
insidious
as
it
went
its
draft
roared
thunderingly
it
snatched
up
countless
firebrands
and
sent
those
flaming
heralds
forth
to
announce
its
coming
to
the
trembling
forest
beyond
as
it
topped
the
cañon
walls
it
seemed
to
leap
beyond
the
clouds
that
hovered
overhead
and
burn
asunder
the
very
heavens
of
a
sudden
i
was
enveloped
by
one
of
its
serpentine
arms
it
writhed
everywhere
around
me
hissing
striking
at
my
face
singing
my
hair
scorching
my
frantic
hands
that
would
ward
it
off
my
eyes
could
not
face
that
venomous
glare
my
lungs
were
choked
by
its
searing
breath
i
found
a
stick
and
feeling
my
way
with
it
fled
like
the
beaver
to
the
brook
for
sanctuary
that
flaming
serpent
pursued
me
its
breath
grew
more
acrid
more
deadly
i
coughed
convulsively
strangled
stumbled
fell
when
i
regained
my
feet
i
was
dazed
confused
but
i
retained
consciousness
enough
to
know
i
must
keep
moving
i
must
reach
the
fire
immemorial
enemy
and
enlist
the
aid
of
that
watery
ally
to
escape
it
i
took
leaps
over
the
ground
but
blindly
with
no
such
brilliant
eyes
as
my
relentless
foe
the
memory
of
that
race
for
life
is
still
vividly
terrifying
blinded
choking
crashing
into
trees
falling
struggling
to
my
feet
fighting
on
and
on
and
on
for
what
seemed
endless
hours
in
reality
it
was
it
could
only
have
been
a
few
moments
i
plunged
into
the
brook
and
submerged
my
burning
clothes
my
tortured
body
i
hurried
on
as
fast
as
i
could
downstream
halting
now
and
then
to
dive
beneath
the
grateful
waters
of
the
deeper
pools
but
never
stopping
until
staggering
gasping
sobbing
i
reached
the
safety
of
the
cañon
illustration
the
memory
of
that
race
for
life
is
still
vividly
terrifying
chapter
eight
the
proverbial
busy
beaver
it
was
my
boyish
ambition
to
find
some
corner
of
those
rocky
wilds
where
no
human
being
had
ever
set
foot
and
to
be
the
first
person
to
behold
it
what
boy
has
not
felt
that
columbus
had
several
advantage
of
him
that
balboa
was
a
meddlesome
old
chap
who
might
better
have
stayed
in
spain
and
left
american
oceans
to
american
boys
to
discover
oh
the
unutterable
regret
of
youthful
hearts
that
the
golden
fleece
and
the
holy
grail
and
other
high
adventures
passed
before
their
time
in
searching
for
my
virgin
wilderness
i
saw
many
spots
that
bore
no
trace
of
human
existence
wild
enough
remote
enough
calm
enough
to
justify
my
willing
credulity
but
i
had
another
notion
which
even
my
young
enthusiasm
had
to
acknowledge
was
in
error
i
fancied
that
the
animals
in
such
a
spot
as
i
have
described
unwise
to
the
ways
of
man
having
had
no
experience
to
teach
them
fear
and
caution
would
be
gentle
and
trusting
and
approachable
i
was
doomed
to
disappointment
i
found
that
no
matter
how
remote
the
region
how
primeval
its
forests
or
how
its
streams
its
beasts
were
furtive
wary
distrustful
but
after
all
though
these
ideas
like
many
of
my
other
youthful
dreams
did
not
pan
out
in
following
them
up
i
found
other
leads
which
yielded
rich
experiences
when
i
first
came
to
the
mountains
the
beavers
were
extremely
wild
rarely
did
i
glimpse
one
or
even
see
signs
of
their
activities
true
all
along
the
streams
were
deserted
beaver
homes
merely
stick
frames
with
most
of
the
mud
plaster
fallen
off
and
through
the
meadows
were
a
succession
of
dams
which
might
easily
have
flooded
them
for
miles
around
no
doubt
large
colonies
had
once
lived
there
once
in
a
while
i
found
a
fallen
aspen
with
the
marks
of
a
beaver
keen
chisels
upon
it
but
as
for
the
beaver
renowned
industry
it
was
i
thought
beavers
were
busy
animals
i
complained
to
the
parson
i
heard
industrious
folks
called
beavers
all
my
life
i
do
see
how
they
got
their
reputation
why
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
be
these
beavers
the
old
man
laughed
now
you
rather
hard
on
the
little
critters
he
defended
they
not
so
indolent
considering
their
chances
then
he
went
on
to
explain
a
horde
of
trappers
he
said
had
followed
kit
carson
successful
trip
into
the
region
in
they
visited
every
stream
and
strung
traps
in
all
the
valleys
beaver
fur
was
taken
out
by
load
in
twenty
years
the
trappers
had
reaped
the
richest
of
the
harvest
in
ten
years
more
they
had
practically
trapped
out
all
the
beavers
they
left
only
when
trapping
ceased
to
be
profitable
and
even
so
the
early
settlers
had
found
some
small
profit
in
catching
a
few
beavers
every
winter
the
survivors
my
old
friend
said
were
wiser
if
sadder
animals
than
those
the
first
trappers
found
many
beavers
had
maimed
or
missing
feet
reminders
of
the
traps
that
caused
their
trouble
they
deserted
their
ponds
neglected
their
dams
and
houses
and
sought
refuge
in
holes
in
the
banks
of
streams
their
tunnels
entered
the
bank
under
water
thus
making
it
difficult
to
locate
their
runways
or
to
set
traps
after
the
discovery
of
the
runways
so
that
was
the
reason
for
the
beavers
scarcity
and
wariness
few
were
the
chances
they
gave
me
on
my
early
rambles
to
observe
their
habits
but
just
when
it
seemed
they
were
doomed
to
suffer
the
fate
of
the
buffalo
colorado
and
a
few
other
states
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
beavers
were
threatened
to
be
classed
with
the
dodo
and
feeble
measures
were
taken
to
protect
them
slowly
their
numbers
increased
they
returned
to
their
normal
habits
of
living
and
rebuilt
their
dams
and
houses
down
in
the
valley
below
my
cabin
within
a
few
rods
of
the
spot
where
the
ruins
of
kit
carson
cabin
still
stand
are
two
small
streams
along
which
i
early
found
numerous
traces
of
beaver
at
the
confluence
of
these
streams
were
dams
and
houses
that
were
not
entirely
deserted
for
occasionally
the
beavers
did
some
repair
work
since
they
were
within
five
minutes
walk
of
my
cabin
i
visited
them
frequently
during
all
seasons
of
the
year
five
times
i
saw
the
beavers
return
to
the
old
home
site
repair
the
dams
and
rebuild
the
houses
four
times
i
saw
them
forced
to
desert
their
home
once
because
a
fire
burned
the
surrounding
trees
which
were
their
source
of
food
the
other
times
to
elude
trappers
i
discovered
that
this
colony
consisted
of
a
old
couple
and
their
annual
brood
the
male
had
lost
a
portion
of
his
right
hind
foot
his
mate
had
only
a
stump
for
her
left
front
one
i
early
dubbed
them
and
peg
and
came
to
have
a
real
neighborly
affection
for
them
their
infirmities
made
it
easy
for
me
to
keep
track
of
them
and
to
keep
up
with
their
social
activities
neighborly
interest
must
be
kept
alive
by
the
neighbors
doings
you
know
they
certainly
showed
no
inclination
to
become
dull
from
overwork
about
the
time
the
ice
on
their
pond
began
to
break
up
they
would
take
their
youngsters
and
start
upon
their
summer
vacation
upon
a
number
of
occasions
i
found
their
familiar
tracks
along
the
streams
eight
or
ten
miles
below
their
home
site
once
more
than
fifteen
miles
away
on
their
rambles
they
met
other
beaver
families
and
stopped
to
visit
the
young
people
of
the
combined
families
played
and
splashed
about
while
their
more
sedate
elders
lay
contentedly
basking
in
the
sun
but
late
august
or
early
september
always
saw
and
peg
back
home
usually
without
their
youngsters
those
precocious
paddlers
had
set
up
homes
for
themselves
or
had
wedded
into
other
tribes
the
old
couple
at
once
set
to
work
toiling
night
and
day
taking
no
time
off
for
rest
they
repaired
their
dam
to
raise
the
water
to
the
desired
level
replastered
their
house
inside
and
out
with
mud
and
in
addition
cut
down
a
number
of
aspen
trees
severed
their
trunks
into
lengths
they
could
handle
and
brought
both
trunks
and
limbs
down
into
the
pond
they
towed
the
heavy
green
wood
down
first
and
piled
it
in
the
deep
water
near
their
house
the
rest
they
piled
upon
these
until
their
larder
was
full
they
ate
the
whole
of
the
smaller
limbs
of
the
aspen
but
only
the
bark
of
the
larger
boughs
and
trunks
they
used
the
wood
for
house
and
dam
construction
trappers
have
told
me
that
the
streams
beaver
live
in
are
poor
fishing
places
because
the
furry
inhabitants
eat
the
fish
by
careful
observation
i
proved
to
my
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
quite
the
opposite
is
true
for
the
deep
ponds
made
by
the
dams
they
build
are
literally
spawning
pools
for
the
trout
breeding
grounds
and
hatcheries
they
are
also
pools
of
refuge
to
which
the
fish
flee
to
elude
the
fisherman
and
in
their
warmer
depths
the
finny
tribe
hole
up
when
the
streams
are
frozen
over
in
winter
i
have
lain
motionless
upon
a
bowlder
overlooking
a
stream
and
watched
large
trout
lazing
about
almost
within
reach
of
a
preoccupied
paddler
apparently
in
no
alarm
over
his
nearness
neither
paid
the
other
any
mind
i
am
sure
that
beavers
eat
neither
fish
nor
flesh
which
reminds
me
that
early
in
my
mountain
experience
i
happened
upon
an
old
trapper
log
cabin
and
stopped
to
visit
him
mountain
hospitality
generously
insists
that
guests
be
fed
no
home
or
hut
is
too
poor
to
provide
a
bite
for
the
chance
visitor
upon
this
occasion
i
was
handed
a
tin
plate
with
some
meat
on
it
guess
what
it
is
my
host
urged
i
tasted
the
meat
examined
it
smelled
it
and
tried
to
make
out
what
it
was
it
tasted
somewhat
like
venison
yet
not
quite
the
same
it
had
something
the
flavor
of
steak
broiled
over
a
campfire
but
it
was
sweeter
and
not
so
strong
i
guessed
wrong
several
times
before
the
trapper
informed
me
beaver
tail
he
laughed
pleased
at
outwitting
me
still
chuckling
he
went
outside
to
a
little
log
meat
house
and
returned
with
a
whole
beaver
tail
for
my
inspection
the
tail
was
about
ten
inches
in
length
nearly
five
inches
wide
at
the
broadest
part
and
perhaps
an
inch
thick
the
skin
that
covered
the
tail
was
dark
in
color
and
very
tough
suggestive
of
alligator
skin
the
meat
of
the
beaver
tail
was
much
prized
by
explorers
and
trappers
and
visitors
such
as
i
were
often
given
this
meat
as
a
special
treat
the
old
fellow
talked
at
length
about
the
wise
ways
of
the
beaver
he
had
caught
though
i
made
note
of
a
number
of
his
observations
for
future
reference
i
was
skeptical
of
their
authenticity
as
years
passed
and
i
talked
with
many
men
i
found
that
their
observations
varied
greatly
they
were
not
always
unprejudiced
observers
their
observations
were
colored
by
their
personal
point
of
view
under
diverse
conditions
i
early
learned
that
trappers
and
hunters
as
a
rule
are
not
real
nature
students
they
are
killers
and
killers
have
not
the
patience
to
wait
and
watch
to
take
painstaking
care
and
limitless
time
in
the
study
of
an
animal
they
will
spend
only
a
few
minutes
watching
an
animal
that
a
man
without
a
gun
might
study
for
days
or
even
weeks
they
are
prone
to
snap
judgment
then
their
imaginations
supply
ready
misinformation
for
missing
facts
a
beaver
has
as
many
wives
as
he
can
git
my
host
informed
me
as
we
sat
before
his
fire
there
some
that
do
have
many
and
agin
there
some
that
have
a
lot
and
that
the
reason
we
find
some
ponds
with
only
a
little
house
an
others
with
mighty
big
ones
a
brigham
youngish
sort
of
conception
of
beaver
domestic
economy
that
same
summer
another
trapper
in
middle
park
not
many
miles
from
the
first
gave
me
his
version
of
a
beaver
domestic
life
do
think
they
mate
at
all
he
told
me
they
always
working
to
beat
time
or
else
they
wanderin
off
somewhere
lookin
up
good
cuttin
timber
and
dam
sites
now
i
am
sure
that
and
peg
were
mated
and
for
life
indeed
i
believe
all
beavers
mate
for
life
they
are
by
nature
domestic
and
industrious
and
provident
storing
up
food
for
the
winter
making
provision
against
the
time
food
will
be
scarce
because
of
snow
and
ice
they
have
the
coöperative
instinct
and
often
combine
their
efforts
constructing
a
house
large
enough
for
the
whole
colony
in
the
deepest
water
of
the
pond
all
joining
in
the
harvesting
of
green
aspen
or
cottonwood
every
fall
i
watched
and
peg
at
their
repairs
their
tribe
increased
as
the
years
passed
and
the
shielding
laws
of
the
state
protected
them
i
called
their
group
the
old
settlers
colony
illustration
every
fall
i
watched
and
peg
at
their
repairs
one
fall
the
old
settlers
abandoned
their
pond
and
constructed
an
entirely
new
dam
above
it
thus
solving
a
number
of
problems
sand
and
gravel
carried
down
by
the
swift
little
stream
had
settled
in
the
still
water
of
the
pool
and
almost
filled
it
the
family
outgrew
the
old
house
all
the
aspens
had
been
cut
this
necessitated
the
dragging
of
trees
too
great
a
distance
before
they
could
be
pushed
into
the
water
and
floated
down
coyotes
had
surprised
and
killed
a
number
of
the
old
settlers
kin
as
they
worked
on
the
long
portage
to
the
stream
and
i
am
sure
that
the
moving
of
their
home
was
partly
to
overcome
this
danger
then
it
was
they
earned
the
title
busy
beaver
how
they
worked
that
was
before
the
days
of
ubiquitous
automobiles
and
the
beavers
had
not
become
nocturnal
in
their
habits
they
swarmed
everywhere
certain
ones
were
detailed
to
inspect
the
dam
make
necessary
repairs
and
maintain
the
water
at
the
same
level
all
the
time
others
worked
at
the
new
house
piling
sicks
and
mud
into
a
heap
it
grew
the
dam
was
raised
so
the
water
was
maintained
within
a
few
inches
of
the
top
of
the
unfinished
wall
occasionally
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
workers
in
the
deep
water
or
near
the
shores
of
the
ponds
they
were
digging
water
escapes
for
emergency
use
these
canals
led
from
the
house
to
either
bank
and
connected
with
tunnels
that
had
their
openings
concealed
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
thus
should
their
pond
be
drained
suddenly
they
could
escape
by
the
canals
to
their
emergency
homes
beneath
the
bank
other
beavers
worked
in
the
aspen
grove
felling
trees
and
cutting
them
into
lengths
that
could
be
pushed
or
pulled
or
rolled
to
the
bank
and
floated
down
the
stream
their
work
was
impeded
by
the
jamming
of
the
logs
in
a
narrow
rocky
neck
down
which
they
had
to
be
skidded
into
the
water
then
the
engineers
decided
upon
the
construction
of
a
canal
around
the
rocky
falls
they
started
digging
at
a
point
upstream
beyond
the
troublesome
neck
swung
outward
away
from
the
water
to
the
fringe
of
aspens
then
back
again
to
the
stream
below
the
rocks
in
all
the
canal
was
two
hundred
feet
long
about
two
feet
wide
and
averaged
fifteen
inches
deep
for
a
time
all
other
work
was
suspended
and
night
and
day
the
whole
population
toiled
on
the
canal
apparently
each
beaver
had
his
own
section
to
dig
and
each
went
about
his
work
in
his
own
way
with
tooth
and
claw
they
worked
often
they
cut
slides
or
runways
down
the
sides
of
the
canal
giving
them
roads
up
which
they
carried
their
loose
dirt
for
nights
they
toiled
in
the
dry
ditch
then
turned
water
in
and
completed
the
work
of
deepening
the
canal
this
transportation
system
saved
them
much
labor
and
delay
and
provided
a
safe
route
to
and
from
the
grove
for
they
could
dive
into
the
water
when
their
enemies
attacked
i
suspected
and
peg
directed
the
storing
away
of
that
wood
for
it
was
piled
in
the
deep
water
beside
the
house
now
rising
majestically
several
feet
about
the
level
of
the
pool
just
as
they
always
did
theirs
the
green
wood
was
almost
as
heavy
as
the
water
and
required
little
weight
to
force
it
under
thus
they
always
had
some
food
in
their
icebox
where
they
could
reach
it
handily
when
the
pool
froze
over
i
have
observed
other
beavers
on
larger
streams
come
out
of
their
tunnels
in
the
banks
and
find
food
along
the
shores
throughout
the
winter
months
but
the
smaller
the
stream
the
closer
the
beaver
sticks
to
his
pond
this
i
believe
is
a
matter
of
safety
for
beavers
are
slow
travelers
and
if
they
venture
far
from
their
pool
they
fall
easy
prey
to
such
enemies
as
bobcats
coyotes
wolves
and
mountain
lions
one
day
while
following
one
of
the
small
tributaries
of
the
vrain
river
south
of
long
peak
i
heard
a
loud
explosion
just
ahead
of
me
and
when
i
emerged
from
the
fringing
woods
i
discovered
two
men
busy
dynamiting
the
largest
of
the
three
beaver
dams
in
the
valley
mining
did
pan
out
much
one
of
them
replied
in
answer
to
my
question
so
we
callated
we
take
sum
beaver
fur
to
tide
us
over
the
winter
they
were
prospectors
out
of
grub
up
against
starving
or
getting
a
job
in
the
foothills
town
below
until
with
their
golden
promises
they
could
again
talk
some
sympathetic
listener
out
of
a
grub
stake
not
content
with
obtaining
beaver
by
the
usual
but
slower
method
of
trapping
they
had
decided
to
blow
up
the
dam
drain
the
pond
and
shoot
the
animals
as
they
sought
to
escape
their
rifles
lay
ready
to
their
hands
for
hours
i
lingered
to
see
what
luck
they
would
have
they
set
off
three
heavy
charges
before
the
dam
was
shattered
when
the
water
was
nearly
drained
out
it
took
but
a
few
minutes
they
grabbed
their
guns
not
a
beaver
did
any
of
us
see
they
then
set
a
charge
of
powder
against
the
house
and
blew
a
gaping
hole
in
its
side
but
there
was
nobody
home
evidently
all
had
escaped
by
the
canal
in
the
bottom
of
the
pond
to
the
tunnel
beneath
the
bank
the
men
would
not
admit
defeat
but
set
about
to
dig
the
beavers
out
of
the
bank
darkness
saw
their
task
unfinished
so
they
camped
for
the
night
at
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel
they
piled
heavy
stones
at
its
mouth
hoping
to
trap
the
animals
within
next
morning
i
watched
them
resume
their
work
feeling
sympathy
for
the
beavers
but
not
daring
to
interfere
shortly
after
noon
the
quest
ended
quite
unexpectedly
the
diggers
had
discovered
a
hidden
exit
that
was
concealed
among
the
willows
the
beavers
had
followed
the
canal
which
could
not
be
drained
to
their
refuge
tunnel
in
the
bank
and
when
their
enemies
destroyed
the
tunnel
they
had
used
the
hidden
exit
and
had
in
all
probability
made
good
their
retreat
during
the
night
as
more
people
settled
in
the
valleys
there
was
an
inevitable
overlapping
of
claims
the
settlers
claimed
both
the
water
and
the
land
and
they
had
government
deeds
to
back
them
up
in
their
claims
but
the
beaver
had
prior
rights
and
gamely
adhered
to
them
a
feud
arose
that
is
still
unsettled
between
the
old
settlers
and
the
newcomers
in
my
rambles
i
continually
came
upon
homesteaders
striving
to
drain
the
valleys
and
raise
grass
for
their
cattle
while
simultaneously
the
beavers
were
working
to
maintain
high
water
many
of
them
lost
their
lives
for
their
cause
but
rarely
did
they
forsake
a
home
site
once
established
in
the
same
sections
where
the
homesteaders
had
used
aspen
for
their
fence
posts
the
beavers
no
doubt
mistaking
them
for
trees
cut
them
down
sometimes
their
pluck
and
persistence
won
them
the
admiration
of
their
enemies
in
most
cases
they
won
out
one
day
far
up
near
the
headwaters
of
the
cache
la
podre
river
in
colorado
i
came
upon
a
rancher
trying
to
drain
a
number
of
beaver
ponds
to
secure
water
for
irrigation
it
was
a
very
dry
season
and
water
was
scarce
during
the
day
he
tore
gaps
in
the
dams
during
the
night
the
beavers
repaired
the
breaks
when
after
opening
the
dams
the
rancher
hurried
down
to
his
fields
to
regulate
the
flow
of
water
the
beavers
even
in
the
daytime
would
swarm
forth
and
plug
up
the
holes
finally
in
desperation
the
man
set
traps
in
the
gaps
he
had
opened
in
the
dams
he
caught
a
few
beavers
and
decided
that
his
troubles
were
over
but
the
survivors
met
the
emergency
they
floated
material
down
from
above
and
wedged
it
into
the
breaks
without
going
near
the
traps
at
this
stage
of
the
struggle
an
old
prospector
came
down
from
the
higher
mountains
driving
his
burros
ahead
of
him
hearing
of
the
rancher
predicament
he
suggested
his
own
panacea
for
all
troubles
dynamite
enthusiastically
the
rancher
accepted
his
proposal
soon
the
dams
were
in
ruins
a
mile
below
where
the
dams
had
been
destroyed
an
irrigation
ditch
tapped
the
river
and
carried
a
full
head
to
the
green
fields
i
saw
the
rancher
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
field
water
flowing
all
about
him
he
looked
upstream
and
chuckled
then
leaned
triumphantly
on
his
shovel
handle
for
a
long
time
he
leaned
thus
lost
in
dreams
of
prosperity
suddenly
he
awoke
and
hurried
along
his
supply
ditch
barely
a
trickle
was
coming
down
it
the
beavers
had
dammed
the
intake
i
once
worked
for
a
rancher
who
had
a
homestead
on
the
north
fork
of
the
vrain
river
which
heads
south
of
long
peak
he
had
just
finished
clearing
a
patch
of
ground
to
raise
truck
on
we
got
to
get
rid
of
some
beaver
he
told
me
the
very
first
day
he
shouldered
his
shovel
and
walked
down
to
the
dam
that
sprawled
across
the
meadow
for
several
hundred
feet
i
cut
her
loose
he
informed
me
on
his
return
she
soon
dry
out
so
we
can
put
in
the
crop
next
morning
whistling
happily
he
started
out
for
the
meadow
his
whistle
died
away
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
water
in
the
pond
it
was
as
high
as
usual
the
beavers
had
repaired
the
break
day
after
day
he
cut
the
dam
night
after
night
the
beavers
repaired
it
he
trapped
five
of
them
before
they
became
after
that
they
either
turned
the
traps
over
or
covered
them
with
mud
after
trying
a
number
of
ruses
to
frighten
them
away
the
man
hung
a
lighted
lantern
in
the
break
he
had
opened
in
the
dam
the
next
morning
his
whistle
piped
merrily
the
break
was
still
open
but
his
joy
was
for
on
the
following
night
the
beavers
constructed
a
new
section
of
dam
above
the
break
curving
it
like
a
horseshoe
hope
they
appreciated
my
givin
light
to
work
by
he
laughed
and
gave
up
the
contest
beavers
seem
to
possess
sagacity
in
varying
degrees
the
old
animals
are
wise
according
to
their
years
the
stupid
and
lazy
die
young
they
adapt
themselves
quickly
to
changed
conditions
they
outwit
their
enemies
by
sheer
cunning
never
in
physical
combat
rarely
do
they
defend
themselves
and
not
once
have
i
known
one
to
take
the
offensive
side
of
a
fray
watching
them
waddling
along
one
wonders
how
they
accomplish
their
great
engineering
feats
in
so
short
a
time
of
course
they
can
move
more
rapidly
in
water
than
on
land
but
i
suspect
its
everlasting
teamwork
that
accounts
for
their
achievements
they
are
prolific
and
unlike
the
bees
drones
are
unknown
to
them
coöperative
industry
there
lies
the
secret
i
was
absent
from
my
cabin
for
more
than
a
year
and
upon
my
return
at
once
visited
the
old
settlers
like
any
other
thriving
community
they
had
made
several
improvements
two
new
ponds
and
houses
had
been
built
tracks
in
the
edge
of
a
small
new
pond
showed
that
my
pioneer
friends
and
peg
had
removed
to
a
new
home
whether
the
increasing
number
of
beavers
in
the
larger
pond
got
on
the
old
folks
nerves
i
do
not
know
but
whatever
the
reason
they
were
living
alone
i
walked
rapidly
toward
their
home
instead
of
approaching
slowly
and
giving
them
a
chance
to
look
me
over
as
i
neared
the
edge
of
the
road
one
of
them
i
presume
pa
peg
smote
the
water
a
mighty
whack
with
his
tail
both
disappeared
i
watched
for
their
reappearance
for
i
knew
that
they
were
watching
me
from
their
concealment
among
the
willows
i
sang
whistled
called
to
them
to
come
out
that
i
was
their
old
friend
returned
my
persistence
was
at
last
rewarded
shyly
they
came
to
the
surface
watching
me
sharply
the
while
diving
at
my
slightest
movement
reappearing
on
the
farther
shore
cautious
and
canny
as
ever
it
was
spring
within
a
few
weeks
after
my
homecoming
the
pegs
would
permit
my
near
approach
as
they
had
done
before
i
went
away
though
they
worked
mostly
at
night
they
did
venture
out
in
daytime
if
they
were
working
at
separate
tasks
the
first
to
discover
me
would
thump
the
ground
or
give
the
water
a
resounding
whack
one
morning
daddy
peg
was
missing
from
the
pond
downstream
i
picked
up
his
tracks
and
discovered
that
he
was
hastening
away
from
home
as
it
was
springtime
i
was
not
concerned
lest
he
was
deserting
his
faithful
wife
it
was
his
habit
to
leave
home
when
peg
was
expecting
i
knew
he
come
waddling
back
in
a
few
weeks
to
give
the
babies
their
daily
plunge
sure
enough
peg
came
forth
with
four
midgets
in
fur
a
happy
romping
family
that
splashed
about
the
pool
for
hours
at
a
time
like
all
their
kin
they
had
been
born
with
their
eyes
open
and
were
much
perter
then
other
animal
infants
they
swam
and
ate
and
took
the
trail
at
once
if
peg
showed
fear
of
anything
the
youngsters
took
quick
alarm
and
forever
afterward
shunned
the
object
of
me
peg
took
little
notice
merely
giving
me
the
right
of
way
if
i
intruded
on
one
of
her
trails
or
stopping
work
to
watch
me
curiously
whenever
i
came
near
the
beaver
babies
accepted
me
as
a
friend
permitted
me
to
sit
or
stand
near
them
as
they
played
one
morning
as
i
approached
the
pool
i
discovered
the
four
youngsters
in
great
agitation
they
were
not
playing
they
swam
about
restlessly
circled
the
pool
visited
the
dam
swam
out
to
their
house
dived
inside
it
only
to
reappear
almost
at
once
i
searched
around
the
pond
and
found
their
mother
fresh
tracks
leading
toward
the
aspen
grove
near
it
she
had
been
overtaken
by
a
coyote
in
vain
i
tried
to
catch
the
motherless
waifs
but
they
eluded
me
i
went
home
made
a
rude
sort
of
from
an
old
sack
and
returned
to
the
pool
during
my
absence
a
strange
beaver
mother
with
a
brood
of
five
babies
had
visited
the
pool
where
the
orphans
lived
she
immediately
adopted
the
wee
bereft
babies
shortly
the
pool
was
merry
with
the
rompings
of
the
combined
families
chapter
nine
mountain
climbing
mountain
climbing
is
the
reverse
of
the
general
rule
of
life
in
that
the
ascent
is
easier
than
the
descent
and
much
safer
most
climbers
underestimate
the
time
required
to
make
a
chosen
trip
and
starting
out
with
the
day
before
them
ascend
at
their
leisure
making
frequent
and
unnecessarily
long
stops
to
rest
drinking
in
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
from
each
rise
attained
forgetting
to
allow
themselves
sufficient
time
for
the
even
more
difficult
descent
consequently
the
return
trip
is
crowded
on
the
edge
of
darkness
a
dangerous
condition
on
any
trail
any
time
but
especially
hazardous
when
the
climber
is
weary
and
therefore
not
alert
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
see
the
slight
footholds
or
handholds
on
which
he
must
put
his
trust
and
weight
one
day
as
a
boy
i
came
to
grief
because
i
was
so
absorbed
by
the
interesting
things
about
me
that
i
took
no
note
of
the
passing
of
time
or
of
the
altitude
to
which
i
had
climbed
from
my
camp
at
bear
lake
i
had
followed
the
old
flattop
trail
to
the
divide
from
which
i
could
see
a
hundred
miles
or
more
in
all
directions
to
the
north
the
mountains
of
wyoming
peeped
through
purple
haze
eastward
the
foothills
dropped
away
to
the
flat
and
endless
prairies
with
gleaming
lakes
everywhere
west
and
south
my
own
rockies
rose
tier
on
tier
to
snowy
heights
gay
and
fragrant
flowers
beckoned
my
footsteps
off
the
trail
friendly
conies
at
me
from
their
rocky
lookout
posts
fat
marmots
stuffed
themselves
making
the
most
of
their
brief
summer
a
buck
deer
left
off
polishing
his
new
horns
on
a
scraggly
timberline
tree
to
look
at
me
overhead
an
eagle
swept
round
and
round
in
endless
circles
from
the
rim
of
the
cañon
between
flattop
and
hallett
i
viewed
the
spot
where
i
had
blundered
over
the
edge
of
the
on
the
way
to
the
dance
beneath
lay
tyndall
glacier
its
greenish
ice
exposed
by
the
summer
thaw
i
circled
the
head
of
the
cañon
and
climbed
to
the
top
of
hallett
from
my
eerie
height
i
got
an
eagle
view
of
the
world
below
a
hazy
hushed
world
where
the
birds
called
faintly
the
brooks
murmured
quietly
and
even
the
wind
spoke
in
whispers
from
near
by
came
the
crash
of
glacier
ice
falling
rocks
that
thundered
down
the
cliffs
all
the
afternoon
i
traveled
along
the
crest
of
the
divide
wandering
southward
away
from
familiar
country
into
a
new
maze
of
peaks
and
glaciers
deep
cañons
and
abrupt
precipices
suddenly
a
gale
of
wind
struck
me
blinded
me
with
penetrating
snow
in
that
instant
without
preliminary
or
warning
summer
changed
to
winter
and
forced
me
off
the
heights
it
was
impossible
to
thread
my
way
back
over
the
route
i
had
come
for
it
twisted
in
and
out
around
crags
and
cliffs
my
compass
showed
that
the
wind
was
driving
eastward
the
direction
in
which
i
wanted
to
go
so
i
headed
down
wind
secure
in
the
thought
that
i
would
soon
be
off
the
roof
of
the
world
lightning
and
heavy
thunder
accompanied
the
snowstorm
the
clouds
came
down
and
blotted
out
the
day
twilight
descended
upon
the
earth
a
band
of
mountain
sheep
started
up
from
their
shelter
behind
an
upthrust
rock
and
ran
ahead
of
me
i
followed
them
partly
because
they
ran
in
the
direction
i
was
going
and
partly
because
they
are
apt
to
select
the
safest
way
down
the
cliffs
but
they
turned
aside
the
moment
they
were
out
of
the
wind
swung
up
on
a
protected
ledge
and
there
halted
to
wait
out
the
storm
my
compass
had
gone
crazy
a
dozen
times
i
tried
it
out
it
would
point
a
different
direction
whenever
i
moved
a
few
steps
however
the
compass
mattered
little
the
chief
thing
that
concerned
me
was
getting
down
off
the
roof
of
the
world
snow
swirled
down
the
cliffs
plastering
rocks
and
ledges
until
both
footholds
and
handholds
were
hidden
still
i
had
to
go
down
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
hardy
sheep
with
their
heavy
coats
could
wait
out
the
storm
but
night
with
numbing
cold
and
treacherous
darkness
in
which
i
dare
not
move
would
soon
and
vanquish
me
for
an
hour
the
ledges
provided
footing
by
turning
about
twisting
and
doubling
there
was
always
a
way
down
of
a
sudden
the
clouds
parted
a
long
bar
of
sunshine
touched
the
green
forest
far
below
me
focused
for
a
moment
upon
a
single
treetop
then
vanished
as
though
the
shutter
of
a
celestial
camera
has
snapped
shut
at
last
i
came
to
a
ledge
beneath
which
the
sheer
cliff
dropped
away
into
unfathomable
snowy
depths
after
short
excursions
to
right
and
left
i
discovered
that
a
section
of
the
cliff
had
split
off
and
dropped
into
the
cañon
leaving
only
sheer
rock
walls
that
offered
nothing
in
the
way
of
footholds
irresolutely
i
faced
back
the
way
i
had
come
overhead
the
wind
roared
deafeningly
the
snow
came
piling
down
no
hope
of
retracing
my
steps
i
was
tired
that
upward
climb
would
be
slow
and
tortuous
would
require
great
strength
and
endurance
i
faced
about
and
began
a
thorough
desperate
search
for
a
downward
route
i
stood
marooned
in
the
cañon
wall
shaped
like
a
crude
horseshoe
at
its
toe
water
had
leaped
down
and
eroded
a
slight
groove
in
the
solid
rock
this
was
my
only
chance
it
was
not
inviting
but
i
had
no
alternative
it
led
me
down
a
hundred
feet
then
tightened
into
a
sort
of
chimney
just
below
i
could
see
the
swaying
top
of
a
big
tree
firewood
must
be
near
at
hand
wider
ledges
must
lay
close
beneath
fifty
feet
down
the
chimney
just
as
it
deepened
into
a
comfortable
groove
with
rough
gripable
sides
i
came
to
a
sudden
halt
for
the
rock
was
broken
away
the
cleft
bottom
of
the
chute
overhung
the
cliff
below
sweat
streamed
down
my
face
in
spite
of
the
cold
wind
visions
of
a
leaping
campfire
died
out
of
my
mind
the
engelmann
spruce
swayed
toward
me
encouragingly
as
though
offering
to
help
me
down
but
its
top
was
many
feet
from
the
wall
there
was
an
abandoned
bird
nest
in
it
a
little
below
that
was
a
dead
limb
with
a
woodpecker
incision
at
its
base
by
leaning
out
i
could
see
a
hundred
feet
or
more
below
the
bottom
of
the
swaying
tree
in
my
extremity
i
shouted
even
as
i
had
done
in
the
glacier
crevasse
though
there
was
no
one
to
hear
the
echo
came
back
sharply
there
must
be
another
wall
angling
this
one
i
thought
it
got
to
be
done
there
no
other
way
i
spoke
the
words
out
loud
to
boost
my
courage
the
tip
of
the
old
spruce
rose
to
almost
my
level
but
there
was
that
intervening
gulf
between
it
and
the
rock
on
which
i
stood
how
wide
was
that
gulf
i
wondered
five
feet
ten
too
far
a
score
of
times
i
surveyed
the
tried
to
estimate
the
distance
sought
a
foothold
in
the
cramped
rock
chute
and
worked
into
position
for
the
leap
no
sharpshooter
ever
aligned
his
sights
more
carefully
than
i
did
my
feet
my
coat
was
buttoned
tightly
cap
pulled
down
when
at
last
i
was
all
set
i
hesitated
postponed
the
jump
and
cowered
back
against
the
wall
a
dozen
times
i
made
ready
filled
my
lungs
with
deep
breaths
stretched
each
leg
out
to
make
sure
it
was
in
working
order
but
every
time
my
courage
failed
me
suddenly
resolute
not
giving
myself
chance
to
think
i
tensed
filled
my
lungs
leaned
away
from
the
rock
and
launched
headlong
as
my
body
crashed
into
the
treetop
my
fingers
clutched
like
talons
my
arms
clasped
the
limbs
as
steel
bands
i
was
safe
in
the
arms
of
that
spruce
never
since
that
day
have
i
taken
such
a
chance
the
thought
of
it
even
now
sends
cold
prickly
chills
along
my
spine
that
time
trouble
came
out
of
a
clear
sky
but
sometimes
a
bit
of
innocent
curiosity
betrays
one
thus
one
day
with
sunshine
overhead
and
peaceful
murmurs
below
i
stood
upon
a
rock
spire
upthrust
from
the
slope
of
mount
chapin
watching
a
band
of
bighorn
sheep
above
timberline
the
fall
river
road
now
runs
past
the
spot
where
they
were
feeding
when
i
climbed
up
toward
them
they
gathered
close
together
some
of
them
scrambling
up
rocks
for
vantage
points
all
watching
me
interestedly
they
were
not
excited
they
moved
away
slowly
at
my
near
approach
stopping
now
and
then
to
watch
me
or
to
feed
for
several
hours
i
kept
my
position
below
them
sometimes
edging
close
to
one
of
them
keeping
in
sight
at
all
times
and
being
careful
not
to
move
quickly
the
band
worked
its
way
to
the
foot
of
the
steeper
slopes
above
the
tree
line
hesitated
eyed
me
then
started
up
a
narrow
little
passage
that
led
up
between
two
cliffs
a
cluttered
this
granite
stair
stable
footholds
were
impossible
for
the
loose
rocks
slipped
and
slid
rolled
from
beneath
the
sheep
feet
and
bounded
down
the
slope
of
a
sudden
something
frightened
the
bighorn
just
what
i
had
no
time
to
learn
instantly
every
one
of
those
nineteen
sheep
was
in
full
flight
up
the
they
bounded
right
and
left
tacked
across
it
turned
scrambled
up
slipped
back
tumbled
somersaulted
but
always
regained
their
balance
and
made
steady
headway
they
seemed
to
have
lost
their
wits
for
they
scattered
each
selecting
his
own
route
all
striving
with
great
exertion
to
make
speed
up
the
steep
slope
a
barrage
of
stones
fell
all
about
me
dotted
the
slide
then
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
move
downward
like
the
rapids
of
a
river
dashing
rock
spray
everywhere
the
air
was
filled
with
flying
granite
as
hurtling
rocks
struck
and
exploded
into
smoky
fragments
bits
the
size
of
scattered
like
birdshot
larger
pieces
the
size
of
bushel
baskets
and
barrels
bounded
and
danced
leaped
away
from
the
slope
out
into
space
and
dropped
like
plummets
huge
bowlders
sleeping
titans
that
they
were
stirred
roused
themselves
and
came
crashing
down
plowing
through
the
forest
below
furrowing
the
earth
and
cutting
a
swath
through
the
trees
as
clean
as
a
scythe
through
grass
what
was
first
merely
the
metallic
clink
of
rolling
stones
changed
to
a
steady
bombardment
and
then
into
a
sullen
ominous
roar
as
the
giant
bowlders
got
under
way
for
me
the
scene
had
changed
abruptly
a
moment
since
i
had
been
following
the
wild
sheep
with
ready
camera
stalking
them
entertaining
them
with
antics
occasionally
hiding
for
a
moment
to
excite
them
now
pandemonium
reigned
the
first
few
stones
i
dodged
then
they
came
too
thick
to
be
avoided
i
dived
headlong
behind
a
bowlder
partly
buried
in
the
slide
like
a
rabbit
i
hid
there
clinging
as
the
stones
hailed
about
me
afraid
to
lift
my
head
rocks
struck
close
filling
my
eyes
with
gritty
dust
choking
me
then
a
giant
slab
came
grinding
downward
i
could
hear
it
coming
its
slow
thunder
drowned
out
all
other
sounds
the
whole
mountain
heaved
my
rock
fort
shook
flinging
me
backward
amidst
a
deluge
of
smaller
stones
over
and
over
i
rolled
with
the
loosened
rocks
fighting
frantically
every
instant
inside
a
few
short
busy
seconds
the
giant
slab
shot
past
my
bowlder
had
halted
it
for
only
a
second
as
i
leaped
aside
i
was
pelted
by
a
score
of
stones
battered
bruised
knocked
half
unconscious
eyes
filled
with
sharp
cutting
grit
at
last
i
gained
the
outer
edge
of
the
whirlpool
where
the
movement
was
less
rapid
where
only
the
smaller
stones
trickled
down
dazed
bleeding
and
breathless
i
was
flung
aside
too
blinded
to
see
and
too
stunned
to
avoid
the
projectiles
shooting
my
way
the
slide
lessened
its
roar
diminished
only
occasional
rocks
came
down
then
came
silence
vast
still
and
awesome
after
the
uproar
but
it
was
broken
by
the
belated
descent
of
tardy
stones
loath
to
be
left
behind
miniature
slides
started
hesitated
and
scattered
like
a
battered
bark
i
lay
half
submerged
at
the
edge
of
the
slide
my
cap
was
gone
my
camera
lost
my
clothes
torn
in
a
score
of
places
i
was
scratched
or
bruised
i
crawled
farther
from
the
danger
line
found
a
trickle
of
water
below
a
melting
snowbank
where
i
drank
and
laved
my
bruises
at
length
i
started
down
the
mountain
safe
but
not
sound
somewhat
wiser
thrilled
tremendously
at
the
experience
that
had
come
unannounced
it
is
always
thus
in
mountain
climbing
the
unexpected
is
the
rule
the
habit
of
estimating
time
by
the
number
of
miles
to
be
traveled
goes
by
the
board
in
mountain
work
a
mile
stood
on
end
ceases
to
be
a
mile
and
becomes
a
nightmare
trail
miles
or
those
that
stretch
across
the
mountain
tops
are
not
even
related
to
the
miles
of
straight
smooth
highway
of
the
lower
levels
a
new
unit
of
measurement
should
be
created
for
alpine
climbers
to
conform
to
the
haughty
attitude
of
the
mountains
at
times
upon
the
crest
of
the
continental
divide
and
at
an
altitude
of
from
ten
to
twelve
thousand
feet
i
have
covered
from
three
to
five
miles
in
an
hour
and
again
while
breaking
a
snow
trail
creeping
up
treacherous
glacier
ice
or
edging
along
the
ledges
i
have
often
reversed
the
digits
taking
several
hours
to
gain
a
single
mile
then
too
no
trip
is
taken
twice
under
the
same
conditions
the
mountains
are
never
the
same
the
weather
the
wind
snow
or
rain
conditions
may
alter
decidedly
the
footing
upon
their
slopes
thus
a
climb
that
was
accomplished
on
the
first
of
june
in
one
year
without
serious
obstacles
may
on
the
same
date
another
year
be
found
to
be
impossible
experienced
mountaineers
intuitively
know
when
to
proceed
or
to
turn
back
and
though
they
may
not
be
able
to
explain
why
they
abandon
or
continue
a
trip
they
feel
their
actions
imperative
so
climbing
tests
a
man
judgment
his
physical
endurance
and
tries
his
soul
it
brings
out
his
true
character
the
veneer
of
convention
wears
through
inside
a
few
miles
of
trail
work
and
reveals
the
individual
precisely
as
he
is
often
to
his
shame
but
usually
to
his
glory
thus
a
silent
backward
boy
one
day
became
a
hero
by
diving
headlong
across
smooth
ice
to
rescue
a
trio
of
climbers
who
had
lost
their
footing
and
had
started
to
slide
across
a
glacier
again
upon
a
certain
climb
two
husky
men
who
gave
promise
of
conquering
the
ascent
without
trouble
turned
out
to
be
the
weakest
of
weaklings
abusing
all
the
party
demanding
all
the
guide
help
for
themselves
you
ca
never
tell
how
fur
a
toad
jump
the
parson
said
disgustedly
as
he
heard
the
tale
of
these
two
huskies
who
had
turned
babies
nor
which
way
neither
one
of
the
things
which
i
have
found
most
helpful
on
hard
climbs
is
mental
preparation
if
there
are
certain
lurking
dangers
to
be
overcome
i
have
found
it
a
decided
help
to
admit
the
facts
freely
before
attempting
the
climb
picturing
as
far
as
it
can
be
done
the
situations
that
may
arise
in
this
way
it
is
possible
to
a
certain
degree
to
anticipate
emergencies
before
they
happen
and
to
prepare
for
them
it
also
helps
one
to
act
with
imperative
promptness
it
is
less
easy
to
prescribe
for
physical
preparation
equipment
must
vary
with
needs
and
these
are
as
varied
as
the
climbers
themselves
however
i
have
found
that
it
is
well
to
dress
lightly
for
this
permits
freedom
of
movement
personally
i
prefer
light
low
shoes
that
reach
just
above
the
ankle
the
soles
studded
with
hob
nails
not
the
iron
ones
a
change
of
socks
is
sometimes
a
for
frequently
the
footing
leads
through
ice
water
or
soft
snow
numb
feet
are
always
clumsy
and
slow
and
dangerous
besides
i
have
found
it
best
to
wear
wool
underclothes
and
just
enough
outer
garments
to
keep
one
warm
a
staff
is
a
handicap
on
rockwork
but
helpful
on
glaciers
or
other
ice
climbing
on
the
mountain
tops
as
well
as
upon
the
highways
speed
is
dangerous
haste
on
a
mountain
brings
grief
of
various
kinds
nausea
needless
exhaustion
injuries
never
sprint
climb
slowly
steadily
like
a
sober
old
packhorse
you
will
make
better
time
and
reach
the
summit
in
condition
to
enjoy
your
achievement
i
came
to
distrust
and
to
test
out
every
rung
in
my
rocky
ladders
i
found
that
even
the
most
stepping
stones
were
often
rotten
and
treacherous
weathered
by
the
continual
freezing
and
thawing
of
the
moisture
in
its
seams
often
a
mere
touch
was
sufficient
to
shatter
them
but
sometimes
it
was
not
until
i
put
my
weight
upon
them
holding
to
a
shrub
or
an
bowlder
the
while
that
they
gave
way
i
learned
too
that
the
wise
selection
of
a
route
up
and
down
is
the
crucial
test
of
a
good
guide
in
such
selection
there
are
no
rules
for
every
climb
presents
problems
particularly
its
own
and
what
worked
out
well
on
the
last
climb
may
turn
out
to
be
dangerous
on
the
next
thus
on
one
ascent
of
the
cliffs
of
black
cañon
my
companion
suggested
that
we
follow
a
chimney
a
crack
that
offered
convenient
we
ascended
by
the
selected
route
without
difficulty
but
an
hour
later
when
a
similar
ascent
confronted
us
we
selected
the
same
sort
of
route
and
came
to
grief
finding
our
way
blocked
by
an
overhanging
wall
impossible
to
surmount
the
actual
climbing
of
difficult
places
becomes
a
habit
so
far
as
the
physical
effort
is
concerned
leaving
one
free
to
inspect
the
precipices
above
and
to
feel
out
instinctively
the
possible
routes
to
the
top
the
selection
of
a
way
up
difficult
places
calls
for
the
sixth
sense
instinct
which
can
not
always
be
acquired
by
experience
wild
animals
possess
this
instinct
to
a
great
degree
but
human
beings
are
not
so
unerring
one
man
may
be
blest
with
it
but
another
with
equal
experience
will
be
unreliable
there
is
no
accounting
for
the
wide
difference
in
their
accuracy
it
exists
that
is
all
we
know
there
are
times
when
even
with
this
guiding
instinct
one
comes
to
grief
though
i
have
noted
that
grief
came
to
me
most
often
when
i
was
tired
less
alert
and
more
prone
to
take
chances
or
needless
risks
sometimes
under
stress
of
haste
to
get
off
a
dangerous
place
before
darkness
overtook
me
i
have
had
to
leap
without
looking
no
climber
may
expect
to
survive
many
such
reckless
steps
it
is
the
rule
of
the
mountains
that
you
look
then
do
not
leap
in
most
of
experiences
we
may
make
a
mistake
and
if
wise
profit
by
it
but
in
mountain
climbing
the
first
mistake
is
liable
to
be
the
last
mountain
climbing
is
a
game
a
big
game
divided
as
are
other
sports
into
minor
and
major
divisions
the
minor
climbs
include
the
lesser
peaks
safe
trails
that
lead
to
comfortable
night
camps
the
major
division
includes
almost
everything
from
peeping
into
an
active
volcano
to
getting
imprisoned
in
a
glacier
crevasse
colorado
offers
wide
variety
of
experience
in
both
divisions
it
has
peaks
above
fourteen
thousand
feet
with
hundreds
of
others
almost
as
high
yet
unknown
and
unmapped
the
peaks
that
are
most
widely
known
and
most
often
climbed
are
pike
peak
near
colorado
springs
and
long
peak
in
the
rocky
mountain
national
estes
park
pike
has
long
been
easily
accessible
by
way
of
the
famous
cog
road
and
more
recently
an
automobile
road
has
reached
its
top
but
has
no
royal
road
to
its
summit
only
a
foot
trail
partly
encircles
it
there
are
many
other
than
these
two
peaks
to
challenge
the
climber
the
flattops
in
western
colorado
are
not
necessarily
low
or
smooth

flat
the
san

are
extremely
rough

rugged
the
sangre

at
once
rarely

and
forbidding

exploration
and
the

has
no

every
mountain
offers
its
peculiar
attractions
and
difficulties
all
mountains
entice
the
and
the
adventurous
occasionally
men
lose
their
lives
in
conquering
them
and
not
infrequently
women
die
heroically
scaling
their
slopes
long

early
the
objective
of
experienced
mountain
climbers
for
a
number
of
years
it

all
efforts
to

it
from
to

in
the
summer
of

go
in

climbed
it
every
month
in

and
thus
came
to
know
its
mighty
moods
the
terrific
fury
of
its
storms
the
glory
of
its
outlook

arrived

disappeared
late
in

chapter
ten
modern

back
on
the
farm
of
my
childhood
the
names
of
kit
carson
jim
bridger
buffalo
bill
and
other
renowned
frontiersmen
were
ever
on
the
lips
of
my
parents
their
reckless
bravery
that
took
no
thought
of
self
their
diplomatic
cunning
that
cleverly
kept
the
indians
friendly
their
unlimited
resourcefulness
equal
to
the
most
unprecedented
emergencies
were
the
subjects
of
many
a
heroic
tale
when
i
came
west
no
matter
how
far
i
penetrated
into
remote
regions
if
there
were
trapper
or
prospector
about
i
found
the
immortal
fame
of
these
intrepid
pathfinders
had
traveled
into
those
wildernesses
they
became
the
heroes
of
my
boyish
dreams
the
patterns
of
my
conduct
the
inspiration
of
my
ideals
i
seized
upon
every
written
word
concerning
them
and
plowed
through
thick
volumes
on
the
frontier
for
one
brief
sentence
about
these
gallant
scouts
i
longed
to
emulate
their
fearless
immortal
deeds
they
left
an
indelible
impress
upon
my
character
even
as
they
had
upon
the
romantic
annals
of
their
country
my
growing
familiarity
with
the
rocky
mountain
region
opened
up
one
trail
in
which
i
could
follow
their
footsteps
tourists
were
finding
out
the
country
guides
were
in
demand
in
the
early
days
before
the
creation
of
the
national
park
guides
were
unlicensed
any
experienced
or
climber
could
take
parties
up
the
peak
or
on
other
alpine
trips
i
began
guiding
by
taking
occasional
visitors
up
long
i
furnished
my
horse
and
on
most
trips
supplies
wrangled
the
made
camp
cooked
the
meals
and
gave
invaluable
advice
and
first
aid
all
for
the
munificent
wage
of
five
dollars
a
day
that
sum
made
the
replacement
of
cameras
the
purchasing
of
a
few
coarse
cheap
garments
and
the
acquiring
of
a
montgomery
ward
library
all
such
riches
possible
the
work
afforded
none
of
the
opportunities
for
fame
and
glory
that
had
lurked
in
the
trails
of
my
heroes
i
did
not
creep
stealthily
from
a
wagon
train
in
the
dead
of
night
to
thwart
the
redmen
in
a
fiendish
massacre
i
was
not
compelled
to
kill
game
to
furnish
food
for
my
charges
i
did
not
have
to
find
fords
across
wide
deep
and
treacherous
unknown
rivers
and
steer
cattle
or
heavily
laden
oxen
across
them
but
even
though
the
work
lacked
the
glamour
of
the
pioneers
primitive
golden
day
it
was
not
without
engrossing
interests
it
was
filled
with
drama
relieved
by
comedy
sometimes
fraught
with
tragedy
yes
styles
in
guides
have
changed
since
bill
cody
scouted
the
plains
even
as
they
have
changed
since
i
piloted
my
first
party
up
peak
a
new
breed
has
sprung
up
since
the
people
have
made
such
wide
use
of
their
national
parks
not
only
the
modern
guides
outwit
the
savage
elements
but
under
the
national
park
administration
they
are
required
to
have
a
fund
of
general
information
especially
nature
lore
to
be
able
to
identify
the
thousands
of
varieties
of
wild
flowers
the
birds
animals
and
trees
to
conduct
field
classes
in
geology
and
to
explain
every
phenomenon
of
weather
and
climate
such
a
guide
must
have
the
patience
to
answer
numberless
questions
all
this
in
addition
to
watching
his
charges
as
a
nurse
watches
her
patients
feeling
their
pulses
so
to
speak
and
taking
their
physical
and
moral
temperatures
he
must
keep
up
their
morale
with
entertaining
yarns
he
must
restrain
their
too
ambitious
experience
must
protect
them
from
their
own
foolhardiness
he
must
have
the
charity
to
forbear
deriding
their
stupidity
he
must
be
as
courageous
and
resourceful
as
the
guides
though
his
trials
may
not
be
so
spectacular
a
guide
soon
plumbs
a
man
character
and
fathoms
its
weakness
and
its
strength
as
a
boy
guide
i
trailed
far
into
the
wilds
with
hunting
parties
and
camped
through
the
summers
with
fishermen
geologists
explorers
and
mountain
climbers
the
reaction
of
individuals
to
the
open
spaces
has
ever
been
interesting
to
me
i
have
seen
voluble
women
silent
before
the
awesome
beauty
i
have
seen
phlegmatic
business
men
moved
to
tears
there
was
no
way
of
anticipating
people
reactions
nearly
all
climbers
dread
the
altitude
of
the
high
country
it
is
the
old
man
of
the
sea
to
most
tenderfeet
it
has
as
many
forms
as
the
clouds
and
changes
them
as
readily
it
pounces
upon
the
innocent
but
not
unsuspicious
wayfarer
in
the
form
of
nosebleed
short
wind
earache
balky
watches
digestive
troubles
sleeplessness
and
oversleeping
as
guide
one
day
for
the
wife
of
a
geologist
i
secured
a
new
idea
regarding
altitude
we
were
to
spend
the
day
above
timberline
where
we
hoped
to
identify
the
distant
mountain
ranges
observe
the
wild
life
close
at
hand
and
collect
flower
specimens
we
left
the
valley
at
dawn
let
our
horses
pick
their
way
slowly
upward
we
halted
occasionally
to
watch
a
scampering
chipmunk
or
to
explain
our
harmless
errand
to
a
scolding
squirrel
near
the
timberline
we
emerged
into
a
little
grassy
glade
beside
a
rushing
stream
far
above
and
deep
below
us
grew
a
dense
forest
of
engelmann
spruce
in
the
glade
stood
a
detached
grove
of
perhaps
a
dozen
trees
dead
and
stripped
almost
bare
of
limbs
and
bark
my
lady
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
at
these
she
shook
her
head
sadly
murmuring
to
herself
at
last
she
spoke
is
it
too
bad
she
grieved
i
agreed
sympathetically
then
peered
about
to
learn
the
cause
of
our
sudden
sadness
the
lady
pointed
to
the
dead
trees
wagged
her
head
and
said
is
it
too
bad
the
altitude
killed
them
there
were
green
trees
a
mile
farther
up
the
mountain
above
the
dead
ones
in
the
glade
yet
my
lady
insisted
that
the
altitude
had
singled
out
and
killed
the
little
grove
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
so
we
let
it
go
at
that
of
course
some
persons
really
are
affected
by
altitude
but
weariness
lack
of
muscular
as
well
as
mental
control
often
creates
altitudinous
illusion
of
this
condition
i
had
an
example
while
guiding
a
party
of
three
women
and
one
man
to
the
top
of
long
peak
we
climbed
above
timberline
headed
through
storm
pass
and
finally
reached
keyhole
without
a
single
incident
to
mar
the
perfect
day
the
ladies
were
new
but
plucky
climbers
the
man
rather
blustery
but
harmless
beyond
keyhole
lies
rough
going
smooth
sloping
rocks
and
the
trough
with
its
endless
that
move
like
giant
treadmills
beneath
the
climber
feet
the
pace
i
set
was
very
slow
the
man
wanted
to
go
faster
but
i
called
attention
to
glacier
gorge
below
the
color
of
the
lakes
in
the
cañon
in
short
employed
many
tactics
to
divert
him
from
his
purpose
my
refusal
to
travel
faster
excited
him
he
became
extremely
nervous
and
made
slighting
remarks
regarding
my
guiding
ability
that
ruffled
me
and
embarrassed
the
ladies
hoping
to
convince
him
of
his
error
i
speeded
up
he
remonstrated
at
once
but
when
i
slowed
down
to
our
customary
pace
he
still
objected
saying
we
never
reach
the
top
before
dark
suddenly
he
developed
a
new
notion
climbing
out
upon
a
ledge
he
lifted
his
arms
and
poised
as
though
to
dive
off
the
cliff
guide
he
called
his
voice
breaking
i
must
jump
after
some
confusion
we
were
on
our
way
again
the
man
within
clutch
of
my
hand
all
progressed
without
further
trouble
until
we
reached
the
top
of
the
trough
where
we
halted
to
rest
and
to
look
down
into
wild
basin
memorable
scene
of
my
first
camp
my
charge
craftily
escaped
my
clutches
walked
out
on
a
promontory
and
again
threatened
to
jump
secretly
i
hoped
he
would
carry
out
his
threat
before
we
began
scaling
the
home
stretch
i
tried
to
persuade
the
erratic
idiot
to
remain
behind
but
he
refused
however
we
all
made
the
top
safely
he
relapsed
into
glum
silence
which
i
hoped
would
last
until
we
were
safely
off
the
peak
but
as
we
stood
near
the
brink
of
the
precipice
overlooking
chasm
lake
we
were
startled
to
hear
his
voice
once
more
raised
to
high
pitch
i
must
jump
over
i
got
to
jump
he
screamed
he
waved
his
arms
wildly
as
though
trying
to
fly
the
ladies
begged
me
not
to
approach
him
lest
he
totter
from
his
precarious
perch
summoning
all
the
authority
i
could
command
i
ordered
him
to
come
down
off
the
rock
my
commandment
unheeded
next
i
humored
him
and
tried
to
coax
him
back
upon
the
pretext
of
showing
him
something
of
special
interest
but
he
stood
firm
mentally
at
least
if
not
physically
pushing
the
ladies
ahead
i
hurried
on
toward
the
trail
as
i
started
i
waved
and
shouted
go
on
jump
get
it
over
with
coward
he
turned
back
from
the
edge
swearing
vengeance
against
me
in
abusing
me
however
he
forgot
his
obsession
to
jump
during
the
summer
of
my
experience
with
the
man
who
wanted
to
jump
i
guided
a
party
of
three
men
who
behaved
in
a
totally
different
but
in
quite
as
unexpected
manner
they
were
three
gentlemen
from
new
york
who
wished
to
make
a
night
climb
up
long
peak
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
our
party
left
the
hotel
at
the
foot
of
the
peak
at
eleven
proceeding
upward
through
the
shadowy
forest
we
sang
songs
shouted
listened
to
the
calls
of
the
coyotes
in
the
valley
below
and
from
timberline
saw
the
distant
lights
of
denver
at
one
we
reached
the
end
of
the
horse
trail
in
two
hours
the
horses
had
covered
five
miles
and
had
climbed
up
hundred
feet
we
were
on
schedule
time
though
the
sun
would
gild
the
summit
of
the
peak
soon
after
four
in
the
morning
we
would
arrive
sufficiently
ahead
of
it
to
watch
it
rise
all
at
once
my
troubles
began
the
three
men
wanted
to
race
across
bowlderfield
it
was
sheer
folly
and
i
told
them
so
and
why
but
failed
to
convince
them
they
raced
they
kidded
me
for
being
slow
dared
me
to
race
them
and
gibingly
assured
me
that
they
would
wait
for
me
on
top
and
command
the
sun
not
to
rise
until
i
got
there
they
would
have
their
little
joke
they
waited
for
me
at
keyhole
and
we
moved
slowly
along
the
shelf
trail
beyond
on
that
they
raced
again
but
not
far
for
the
steep
slope
of
the
trough
with
its
slippery
stones
stood
just
beyond
right
there
they
insisted
on
eating
their
lunch
an
untimely
lunch
hour
for
there
was
hard
climbing
yet
to
do
not
satisfied
with
emptying
their
lunch
bags
they
drank
freely
of
some
ice
water
that
trickled
out
from
beneath
a
snowbank
i
got
them
going
at
last
and
we
had
gone
only
a
short
way
when
two
of
them
fell
ill
they
felt
they
just
had
to
lie
down
and
did
so
and
became
thoroughly
chilled
which
added
to
their
pangs
of
nausea
after
awhile
we
proceeded
very
slowly
no
longer
their
song
echoed
against
the
cliffs
they
broke
their
pained
silence
only
to
grumble
at
one
another
midway
of
the
of
the
trough
they
stopped
and
like
balky
mules
refused
to
go
forward
or
turn
back
in
vain
i
urged
them
to
start
down
assuring
them
the
lower
altitude
would
bring
relief
the
sick
men
did
care
what
happened
they
craved
instant
relief
by
death
or
any
other
instantaneous
method
as
seasick
persons
always
do
their
more
fortunate
friend
looked
at
them
in
disgust
as
those
who
have
escaped
the
consequences
of
their
deeds
often
look
at
those
who
have
not
he
upbraided
me
for
not
keeping
them
from
making
fools
of
themselves
i
knew
argument
with
him
would
be
futile
in
his
quarrelsome
frame
of
mind
i
kept
still
his
sick
companions
crawled
beneath
an
overhanging
rock
and
lay
shivering
and
shaking
too
miserable
to
sleep
presently
he
joined
them
sputtering
at
me
as
the
author
of
all
their
troubles
his
sputterings
grew
intermittent
ceased
he
was
audibly
asleep
after
a
long
time
one
of
his
pals
demanded
who
in
the
proposed
this
trip
anyway
the
conduct
of
these
men
was
not
unique
most
climbers
start
out
exuberantly
burn
up
more
energy
than
they
can
spare
for
the
first
part
of
the
trip
and
find
themselves
physically
bankrupt
before
reached
their
goal
the
rarefied
air
of
the
high
country
seems
to
make
them
lightheaded
the
most
disagreeable
character
to
have
in
a
party
as
in
other
situations
is
the
bully
or
who
spoils
everyone
fun
a
guide
is
a
trifle
handicapped
in
handling
such
people
in
that
his
civilized
inhibitions
restrain
him
from
pushing
them
off
the
cliffs
or
entombing
them
in
a
crevasse
i
was
too
small
to
do
them
physical
violence
anyway
so
i
had
to
resort
to
more
subtle
weapons
the
most
effective
being
ridicule
if
a
joke
could
be
turned
on
the
disturber
he
generally
subsided
the
rest
of
the
crowd
were
profuse
in
their
expressions
of
gratitude
to
me
for
such
service
rendered
such
an
individual
was
once
a
member
of
a
fishing
party
i
guided
to
bear
lake
the
trip
was
made
on
horseback
and
we
had
gone
a
mile
before
he
urged
his
horse
out
of
line
and
raced
ahead
calling
to
some
kindred
spirit
to
follow
they
missed
the
turn
and
delayed
the
whole
party
more
than
an
hour
while
being
rounded
up
lanky
as
the
party
dubbed
him
out
of
disrespect
blamed
me
for
their
getting
lost
but
dropped
behind
when
he
saw
the
mirth
of
the
others
along
the
way
were
many
inviting
pools
and
occasionally
we
saw
a
fisherman
lanky
soon
raised
the
question
of
trying
out
the
stream
but
was
outvoted
by
the
others
he
was
inclined
to
argue
the
matter
but
we
rode
up
the
trail
leaving
him
to
follow
or
fish
as
he
desired
at
bear
lake
at
that
time
was
a
canvas
boat
cached
twenty
steps
due
west
of
a
certain
large
bowlder
that
lay
south
of
the
outlet
the
boat
was
small
would
safely
hold
but
two
persons
as
it
was
being
carried
to
the
water
lanky
appeared
and
insisted
on
having
the
first
turn
in
it
to
this
the
others
agreed
much
against
my
wishes
to
save
the
others
from
the
annoyance
of
the
fellow
i
went
out
with
him
in
the
boat
the
trout
were
too
well
fed
to
be
interested
in
our
flies
though
lanky
and
i
paddled
around
and
across
and
tempted
them
with
a
dozen
lures
my
passenger
became
abusive
and
blamed
me
for
wasting
a
good
fishing
day
by
bringing
the
party
to
the
lake
in
the
midst
of
his
tirade
the
boat
tilted
strangely
for
a
few
minutes
he
shamefully
neglected
me
while
he
gave
his
whole
attention
to
righting
it
by
sundown
the
party
had
caught
a
few
small
fish
and
were
ready
to
quit
they
had
gladly
let
lanky
monopolize
the
boat
so
as
to
be
spared
his
society
to
lanky
disgust
we
had
caught
only
two
fish
just
as
we
started
for
the
shore
he
made
a
farewell
cast
something
struck
his
spinner
his
reel
sang
his
rod
bent
and
he
stood
up
in
the
boat
yelling
instructions
at
me
the
rest
of
the
party
quit
fishing
to
watch
him
land
the
fish
the
trout
was
a
big
one
and
game
but
we
were
in
deep
water
with
plenty
of
room
from
the
shore
came
excited
directions
give
him
more
line
reel
him
in
do
let
him
get
under
the
boat
head
him
toward
the
shore
lanky
turned
a
superior
deaf
ear
after
a
tussle
of
ten
minutes
a
trout
lay
in
the
boat
and
lanky
raised
an
exultant
yell
in
which
the
cliffs
of
hallett
joined
now
indeed
was
justice
gone
astray
when
the
one
disagreeable
member
of
the
party
had
the
only
luck
when
the
last
triumphant
echo
died
away
i
picked
up
his
prize
inspected
it
critically
held
it
aloft
for
the
others
to
witness
a
deputy
warden
i
snapped
at
him
disgustedly
and
you
do
keep
small
ones
while
i
around
with
that
i
tossed
the
trout
into
the
lake
just
as
i
finished
the
boat
mysteriously
upset
and
lanky
and
i
followed
the
fish
the
early
trips
i
made
with
parties
were
mostly
short
ones
for
game
or
fish
but
as
more
and
more
visitors
came
each
succeeding
summer
longer
trips
became
popular
from
fishing
the
summer
guests
turned
to
trail
trips
camping
en
route
and
remaining
out
from
five
to
ten
days
to
cross
the
continental
divide
was
the
great
achievement
everyone
wanted
to
tell
his
neighbors
about
trailing
over
the
crest
of
the
continent
and
snowballing
in
the
summer
the
route
commonly
chosen
was
the
flattop
trail
to
grand
lake
where
camp
was
pitched
for
a
day
or
two
then
up
the
north
fork
of
the
grand
river
known
farther
south
as
the
colorado
river
to
poudre
lake
where
another
camp
was
made
from
here
they
made
a
visit
to
specimen
a
mountain
of
volcanic
formation
which
rises
from
the
lake
shore
this
peak
has
ever
been
the
home
of
mountain
sheep
one
can
always
count
on
seeing
them
there
sometimes
just
a
few
stragglers
but
often
bands
of
a
hundred
or
more
however
interesting
the
day
experience
had
been
the
climax
came
after
camp
was
made
supper
served
and
cleared
away
when
a
big
bonfire
was
lighted
and
all
sat
about
it
talking
over
the
happenings
of
the
day
singing
and
putting
on
stunts
in
the
tourists
minds
the
guide
and
the
grizzly
were
classed
together
both
were
wild
strange
and
somewhat
of
a
curiosity
nothing
delighted
them
more
than
to
get
the
guide
to
talking
about
his
life
in
the
wilds
most
of
them
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
vaudeville
artist
when
several
parties
were
out
on
the
same
trip
they
all
assembled
around
a
common
campfire
the
guides
were
given
the
floor
or
ground
and
they
made
the
most
of
the
occasion
such
competition
as
there
was
each
of
course
felt
obliged
to
uphold
the
honor
of
his
party
and
his
fellows
their
stories
grew
in
the
telling
each
more
lurid
than
the
last
there
were
thrilling
tales
of
bear
fights
of
battles
with
arctic
storms
above
timberline
of
finding
rich
and
losing
them
again
at
first
the
guides
stuck
to
authentic
experiences
but
as
the
demand
outgrew
their
supply
they
were
forced
to
invention
they
had
no
mean
imaginations
and
entranced
their
tenderfoot
audiences
with
their
thrilling
tales
around
the
campfires
of
primitive
peoples
have
started
the
folklore
of
races
these
guides
were
more
sophisticated
than
their
rustic
mien
hinted
the
points
of
their
yarns
more
subtle
than
the
city
dwellers
suspected
one
evening
i
reached
the
poudre
lake
camp
at
dusk
to
find
two
other
parties
ahead
of
mine
the
others
had
finished
supper
and
were
gathered
around
the
campfire
with
north
park
ned
the
center
of
attraction
i
was
camped
over
on
troublesome
crick
an
havin
a
busy
time
with
cookin
wranglin
the
hosses
and
doin
all
the
camp
work
the
fellers
they
was
all
men
were
too
plumb
loco
to
help
everything
they
touched
spelt
trouble
they
admired
to
have
flapjacks
same
as
we
et
for
supper
an
they
watched
jest
how
i
made
an
flipped
in
the
frypan
then
they
wanted
to
do
the
flippin
ned
chuckled
quietly
to
himself
and
went
on
i
had
realized
afore
that
a
tenderfoot
with
a
pan
of
hot
smeary
flapjacks
is
as
dangerous
as
he
is
with
a
gun
he
liable
to
cut
loose
in
any
direction
he
ai
safe
nowhere
one
of
them
i
had
out
was
called
doctor
chance
guess
he
got
his
name
cause
other
folks
took
chances
havin
him
round
well
chance
was
the
first
flipper
showed
him
the
trick
of
rotatin
the
frypan
to
loosen
the
jacks
they
would
stick
an
cause
trouble
the
doctor
got
the
hang
of
flippin
did
a
good
job
he
wanted
to
do
it
fancy
the
plain
ordinary
flip
was
good
enough
for
him
no
siree
he
wanted
to
do
it
extra
fancy
instead
of
a
little
flip
so
they
light
batter
side
down
the
doctor
give
a
double
turn
an
they
come
down
in
the
pan
with
a
splash
he
got
away
with
it
two
or
three
times
then
he
got
careless
flipped
a
panful
without
proper
them
jacks
stuck
at
one
edge
flopped
over
and
come
down
on
doc
hands
we
had
to
stop
cookin
and
doctor
the
doctor
then
another
one
of
thought
he
learnt
how
from
watchin
the
doc
so
i
set
back
an
let
have
all
the
rope
he
wanted
it
was
their
party
an
they
could
go
the
limit
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
the
new
guy
slung
high
wide
an
crooked
as
a
sunfishin
bronc
first
thing
i
knowed
there
was
a
shower
of
sizzlin
flapjacks
rainin
where
i
set
an
i
had
to
make
a
quick
getaway
to
keep
from
bein
branded
for
life
then
he
heaved
a
batch
so
high
they
hit
a
dead
limb
over
the
fire
an
wrapped
aroun
it
it
was
then
the
next
feller
turn
and
he
started
in
while
number
two
shinned
up
the
tree
to
get
the
jacks
off
en
the
limb
number
four
had
came
to
bat
yet
so
the
performance
was
due
to
last
some
time
i
got
up
on
a
big
rock
outta
range
number
two
was
in
the
tree
number
three
flippin
number
four
was
a
rollin
up
his
sleeves
an
gettin
ready
for
his
turn
the
third
chef
was
sure
fancy
he
juggled
them
cakes
just
like
a
vodeville
artist
does
of
a
sudden
he
cuts
loose
a
batch
that
sailed
up
high
turned
over
an
cum
down
on
the
back
of
four
neck
him
bein
entertained
at
the
time
by
the
feller
in
the
tree
ned
had
acquitted
himself
well
his
story
had
the
tang
of
reality
in
it
and
he
told
it
with
rare
enthusiasm
he
was
so
clever
in
fact
that
the
younger
guides
including
myself
decided
not
to
enter
the
story
contest
that
night
but
there
was
one
in
camp
who
did
not
hesitate
andrews
was
his
name
i
had
not
seen
this
man
on
the
trail
before
so
listened
as
eagerly
as
the
others
to
what
he
had
to
offer
remember
the
mountain
sheep
we
saw
on
flattop
ed
recalled
as
he
put
aside
his
pipe
well
them
wild
sheep
always
has
interested
me
they
plumb
human
some
ways
i
reckon
they
sure
got
a
whale
of
a
bump
of
curiosity
an
they
beat
country
kids
in
town
when
it
comes
to
starin
at
strange
sights
reckon
there
ai
nuthin
short
of
a
neighbor
that
got
more
curiosity
than
them
sheep
the
old
rams
git
so
wise
they
live
two
or
three
times
as
long
as
the
foolish
ones
that
do
never
seem
to
learn
nothin
ole
curiosity
up
in
back
on
specimen
is
the
biggest
ram
i
ever
saw
he
sure
curious
an
smart
along
with
it
if
trouble
shows
up
around
specimen
why
old
curiosity
just
ai
home
that
all
but
hid
away
somewheres
in
the
cliffs
an
once
when
there
was
shootin
he
went
over
to
another
mountain
till
the
hunters
was
gone
that
there
ole
ram
got
so
famous
that
the
fellers
used
to
devil
the
life
outta
him
they
make
a
show
of
takin
their
gun
up
the
mountain
jest
ter
see
the
old
feller
hide
out
one
day
i
was
guidin
a
party
up
toward
lulu
pass
we
was
down
in
a
deep
gully
with
high
walls
all
to
onct
i
looked
up
an
saw
a
bunch
of
sheep
they
had
seen
us
yet
on
account
of
our
bein
in
the
aspens
i
flagged
the
party
an
told
to
watch
guess
some
one
was
after
the
sheep
for
they
was
in
a
hurry
to
git
across
the
gully
one
at
a
time
they
jumped
off
the
cliff
an
landed
in
the
sand
along
the
river
must
have
been
fifty
feet
anyhow
maybe
more
but
that
did
phase
of
a
sudden
out
walked
ole
curiosity
lookin
as
big
as
a
house
with
circlin
horns
three
feet
long
the
ole
feller
jumped
last
and
jest
as
he
jumped
i
rode
out
of
the
woods
ed
eyed
the
circle
of
eager
faces
his
listeners
tensed
and
leaned
forward
breathlessly
then
he
continued
when
the
ole
ram
was
about
halfway
down
he
seen
me
an
what
do
you
reckon
he
did
his
hypnotized
audience
were
too
spellbound
to
hazard
a
guess
he
turned
aroun
and
went
back
the
story
of
the
ram
that
turned
back
is
still
told
around
the
campfires
of
the
rockies
and
it
has
not
grown
leaner
in
the
repetitions
but
the
guides
are
giving
way
to
younger
ones
more
scientific
but
not
so
entertaining
the
indians
who
have
turned
guides
are
unexcelled
when
it
comes
to
following
trails
that
are
dim
or
in
tracking
down
runaway
horses
indians
have
a
subtle
sense
of

during
the
most
serious
situations
injun
not

trail

one
said
when
adrift
in
the
woods
to
prevent
trails
from
getting
lost
the
park
service
requires
all
to
pass
examinations
on
packing
making
camp
handling
horses
first
aid
familiarity
of
the
region
and
general
aptness
for
the
calling
before
granting
them
a
license
entitling
them
to
conduct
parties
on
the
peaks
and
trails
of
rocky
mountain
national
park
when
the
first
superintendent
was
giving
these
examinations
he
invited
me
to
assist
him
in
order
to
focus
the
attention
of
the
guides
upon
certain
important
essentials
the
questions
started
out
by
asking
what
is
the
first
consideration
of
a
guide
what
is
the
second
consideration
of
a
guide
the
answer
expected
to
the
first
of
course
was
the
safety
of
the
party
and
to
the
second
the
comfort
of
the
party
the
superintendent
and
i
strolled
about
the
room
where
a
dozen
or
more
young
fellows
were
laboriously
writing
out
their
answers
one
chap
in
particular
attracted
my
attention
for
he
was
from
the
woods
a
big
strapping
fellow
with
clear
eyes
and
an
eager
honest
face
i
peeped
over
his
shoulder
beneath
what
is
the
first
consideration
of
a
guide
he
had
written
in
unmistakable
brevity
ham
beneath
what
is
the
second
consideration
of
a
guide
in
a
clear
legible
hand
was
the
kindred
word
bacon
chapter
eleven
off
the
trail
that
same
youthful
ambition
to
emulate
the
early
explorers
and
discover
new
worlds
which
had
led
me
west
also
tempted
my
boyish
feet
off
the
beaten
trails
i
was
told
that
trails
were
the
safe
the
sure
routes
into
and
out
of
the
wilds
but
their
very
existence
proclaimed
that
other
men
had
been
there
before
me
i
was
not
the
first
on
those
narrow
winding
high
roads
i
preferred
the
game
trails
to
them
but
i
liked
better
still
to
push
beyond
even
those
faint
guides
into
the
unmarked
untracked
wilderness
there
i
found
the
last
frontier
as
primitive
as
when
bold
columbus
dared
the
unknown
seas
and
my
young
heart
thrilled
at
such
high
adventure
late
one
fall
i
climbed
high
above
timberline
on
the
long
peak
trail
and
following
my
adventurous
impulse
left
the
pathway
and
swung
over
to
the
big
moraine
that
lay
south
from
its
top
i
peeped
into
the
chasm
that
lies
between
it
and
the
peak
then
angled
down
its
abrupt
slope
to
a
sparkling
waterfall
and
following
along
the
swift
icy
stream
above
it
was
climbing
toward
chasm
lake
when
an
eerie
wail
rose
from
the
gorge
below
somewhere
down
there
a
coyote
was
protesting
the
crimes
committed
against
his
race
his
yammering
notes
rose
and
fell
ascending
and
descending
the
full
run
of
the
scale
swelled
into
a
throaty
howl
and
broke
into
jerky
wailing
yaps
like
a
chorus
of
satyrs
the
uninitiated
could
never
have
believed
all
those
sounds
came
from
one
wolfish
throat
it
seemed
that
it
must
be
that
the
entire
pack
or
at
least
half
a
dozen
animals
raised
that
woeful
lamentation
facing
first
one
way
and
then
another
i
tried
to
locate
the
brokenhearted
mourner
but
long
sheer
precipitous
face
and
the
lofty
cliffs
around
me
formed
a
vast
amphitheater
about
which
echoes
raced
crossing
and
recrossing
intermingling
for
a
full
minute
the
coyote
howled
his
sharp
staccato
notes
rising
higher
and
higher
the
echoes
returning
from
all
directions
first
sharply
then
blurred
faint
fainter
the
higher
the
sounds
climbed
the
gorge
the
longer
were
the
intervals
between
echoes
for
the
cañon
walls
sloped
back
and
were
wider
apart
toward
the
top
i
counted
seven
distant
echoes
of
a
single
sharp
bark
before
it
trailed
off
into
numberless
indistinguishable
echoes
the
varying
angles
and
heights
of
the
walls
altered
their
tones
but
just
as
they
reached
the
top
they
came
in
uniform
volume
and
then
overflowed
the
lower
north
rim
and
were
lost
for
ten
minutes
that
coyote
howled
and
i
tried
to
locate
him
by
the
sound
i
knew
it
would
be
impossible
to
sight
him
for
his
coat
blended
perfectly
with
the
surrounding
bowlders
at
last
i
decided
he
was
due
west
of
me
cautiously
i
started
toward
him
but
as
soon
as
i
moved
he
materialized
from
the
jumbled
pile
of
slide
rock
a
hundred
feet
north
of
where
i
stood
the
echoes
had
fooled
me
completely
i
wondered
then
and
many
times
since
why
he
howled
with
me
so
near
he
surely
saw
me
was
lie
familiar
with
the
echoes
of
the
gorge
did
he
know
their
trickery
did
he
lift
his
voice
there
to
confound
me
he
is
somewhat
of
a
ventriloquist
anywhere
perhaps
he
liked
to
howl
from
that
spot
because
the
abetting
echoes
deluded
him
into
thinking
his
talent
was
increasing
and
he
excelled
all
his
rivals
in
the
mysterious
art
or
perhaps
like
some
singers
i
have
known
he
enjoyed
the
multitudinous
repetition
of
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
after
more
than
a
score
of
years
i
am
no
nearer
a
solution
of
the
riddle
twenty
miles
from
the
spot
where
the
coyote
sang
near
the
headwaters
of
the
poudre
river
i
rode
one
day
in
pursuit
of
a
pair
of
marauding
wolves
as
soon
as
they
discovered
me
tracking
them
they
took
to
an
old
game
trail
that
climbed
several
thousand
feet
in
ten
miles
distance
and
headed
toward
the
timberline
from
their
tracks
i
could
tell
the
country
was
strange
to
them
for
animals
like
men
are
uneasy
in
unfamiliar
surroundings
somewhere
a
prospector
set
off
a
blast
the
sound
rolled
around
and
echoed
from
all
about
the
wolves
were
startled
at
the
repeated
reports
as
they
thought
them
and
at
sea
as
to
the
direction
from
which
they
came
so
they
hid
away
in
a
dense
new
growth
of
engelmann
spruce
when
i
rode
in
sight
with
rifle
ready
across
my
saddle
they
lay
low
no
doubt
fearing
to
blunder
into
an
ambush
if
they
took
flight
a
campbird
sailed
silently
into
the
tops
of
the
young
trees
and
peered
curiously
downward
its
mate
winged
in
and
together
they
hopped
from
limb
to
limb
descending
toward
the
concealed
animals
and
conversing
in
low
tones
of
their
discovery
my
horse
stopped
at
my
low
command
i
raised
my
rifle
and
fired
into
the
undergrowth
beneath
the
trees
the
wolves
sprang
out
at
a
run
with
lightning
bounds
crossed
a
small
opening
and
disappeared
into
the
heavy
forest
beyond
i
continued
firing
at
them
without
effect
just
before
they
vanished
into
the
spruces
i
fired
a
final
salute
to
my
astonishment
they
turned
tail
and
came
racing
back
straight
toward
me
but
glancing
back
fearfully
as
they
came
for
a
foolish
instant
i
thought
they
meant
to
attack
then
the
reason
for
their
action
dawned
on
me
a
sharp
echo
of
each
shot
had
been
flung
back
by
a
cliff
beyond
the
grove
the
fleeing
animals
on
nearing
the
cliff
had
mistaken
these
echoes
for
another
pursuer
they
feared
the
unseen
gun
more
than
the
gun
in
the
open
illustration
they
turned
tail
and
came
racing
back
straight
toward
me
i
killed
them
from
the
saddle
an
echo
had
betrayed
them
but
they
were
in
unfamiliar
country
i
doubt
if
they
would
have
been
misled
at
home
for
animals
are
commonly
familiar
with
every
sight
sound
and
scent
of
their
home
range
and
wolves
are
uncannily
shrewd
thus
i
learned
that
the
same
phenomenon
that
had
confounded
me
deceived
the
animals
echoes
make
an
interesting
study
and
add
mystery
to
the
mountains
but
animals
and
most
woodsmen
have
a
sixth
sense
upon
which
they
rely
an
intuitive
faculty
we
call
instinct
it
is
more
infallible
than
their
conscious
reasoning
or
physical
senses
of
sight
sound
smell
taste
and
touch
it
leads
them
unerringly
through
unblazened
forests
during
blinding
storms
or
in
the
darkness
of
night
it
helps
them
solve
the
enigma
of
echoes
and
sometimes
when
the
vagrant
breezes
trick
their
sensitive
noses
and
bring
scents
to
them
from
the
opposite
direction
of
their
sources
it
senses
the
deception
and
setting
them
on
the
right
path
delivers
them
from
their
enemies
i
suppose
i
must
have
had
this
instinct
to
some
degree
or
i
would
surely
have
been
lost
in
those
mountain
mazes
not
that
anticipation
of
such
a
possibility
would
have
deterred
me
it
would
really
have
added
allurement
to
the
adventure
as
it
was
i
did
get
lost
but
always
succeeded
in
finding
my
way
home
again
but
even
with
this
instinct
people
are
often

when
he

few

travel

to

areas
they
are
as
apt
to
travel
in

direction
as
in
the
opposite
but
they
may
usually
be
looked
for
and
found
in
a
valley
or
cañon
i
was
lost
one
day
within
a
mile
of
home
almost
in
sight
of
the
home
buildings
upon
a
slope
i
knew
well
it
came
about
through
my
following
a
band
of
deer
on
my
skis
the
day
was
windy
the
snow
blowing
about
in
smothering
clouds
i
came
upon
the
deer
in
a
cedar
thicket
at
my
approach
they
retreated
to
a
gully
and
started
up
the
slope
the
snow
grew
so
deep
that
after
floundering
in
it
a
few
yards
they
deserted
the
gully
tacked
back
close
to
me
and
cut
around
the
slope
about
level
with
my
position
i
gave
chase
on
skis
which
almost
enabled
me
to
keep
up
with
them
when
they
altered
their
direction
and
headed
down
hill
i
easily
outran
them
soon
i
was
in
their
midst
but
had
difficulty
in
keeping
my
balance
all
at
once
the
animals
indulged
in
queer
antics
one
lay
upside
down
his
feet
flailing
the
air
another
stood
on
his
head
in
space
two
does
on
my
left
whirled
round
and
round
as
though
dancing
with
a
phonograph
record
for
a
floor
the
next
instant
i
joined
their
troupe
in
the
flash
that
followed
i
remembered
seeing
the
tops
of
small
trees
beneath
me
remembered
my
skis
whipping
across
in
front
of
my
face
in
their
panic
to
escape
me
the
deer
instinct
had
deserted
them
and
they
had
dashed
full
speed
across
a
slope
where
a
spring
overflowed
and
froze
and
the
ice
was
coated
with
snow
when
i
regained
my
feet
i
was
lost
everything
was
unfamiliar
i
set
my
course
toward
a
prominent
thumb
of
rock
but
when
i
reached
it
it
had
either
changed
its
shape
or
moved
the
whole
valley
was
strange
after
skiing
for
several
hours
i
topped
an
utterly
foreign
ridge
below
me
were
houses
i
coasted
down
to
the
nearest
that
had
smoke
rising
from
its
chimney
a
neighbor
living
just
a
mile
from
home
came
to
the
door
then
i
realized
where
i
was
and
recognized
the
strange
valley
the
unfamiliar
ridge
and
my
neighbors
houses
i
had
traveled
in
a
circle
the
fall
with
the
deer
exactly
dazed
me
i
was
unconscious
but
it
had
jarred
shut
the
window
of
my
memory
and
though
almost
at
my
own
door
there
was
nobody
home
the
best
example
of
storm
causing
one
to
lose
one
way
is
the
experience
of
miss
victoria
broughm
the
first
woman
to
climb
peak
alone
she
started
one
september
morning
from
a
hotel
at
the
foot
of
the
peak
taking
a
dog
as
her
companion
she
tethered
her
horse
at
bowlderfield
where
horses
are
usually
left
and
without
difficulty
or
delay
made
the
summit
just
as
she
reached
the
top
a
storm
struck
the
mountain
and
inside
of
a
few
minutes
hid
the
trail
pluckily
miss
broughm
worked
her
way
down
tacking
back
and
forth
mistaking
the
way
but
making
progress
she
was
afraid
to
trust
the
dog
to
guide
her
late
in
the
evening
she
descended
the
trough
a
steep
gully
that
extends
far
below
the
timberline
the
trail
goes
only
part
way
down
this
slide
then
tacks
across
to
keyhole
in
the
storm
she
could
not
distinguish
the
cairns
that
marked
the
and
continued
on
down
the
trough
far
below
the
trail
and
was
lost
that
evening
when
she
did
not
return
to
the
hotel
a
searching
party
set
out
to
find
her
but
a
terrific
gale
was
raging
upon
the
heights
the
searching
party
found
it
almost
impossible
to
battle
their
way
above
the
timberline
and
after
many
ineffectual
attempts
they
returned
nearly
frozen
without
tidings
of
the
lost
girl
william
copper
carl
piltz
and
myself
set
out
at
midnight
for
the
peak
the
wind
that
met
us
at
the
timberline
halted
our
horses
even
jolted
them
off
the
trail
just
above
the
timberline
my
horse
pricked
his
ears
toward
a
sheltered
cove
and
gave
a
little
whinny
we
hurried
forward
hoping
to
find
miss
broughm
but
only
her
horse
was
there
dragging
its
picket
rope
we
proceeded
to
bowlderfield
the
night
was
moonless
and
half
cloudy
the
wind
shrieked
among
the
rim
rocks
and
boomed
against
the
cliffs
our
lantern
would
not
stay
lighted
time
and
again
we
crept
beneath
a
rock
slab
and
relighted
it
only
to
have
it
snuffed
out
the
instant
we
emerged
into
the
wind
across
the
rocks
we
crept
crouching
like
wary
wrestlers
when
sudden
blasts
knocked
us
off
our
feet
we
dropped
flat
and
clung
to
the
rocks
but
even
with
all
our
caution
we
were
toppled
headlong
at
times
or
bowled
over
backward
as
the
wind
struck
us
it
was
after
three
in
the
morning
when
we
reached
keyhole
the
pass
in
the
knifelike
ridge
that
separates
bowlderfield
from
glacier
gorge
the
wind
forced
up
the
slope
from
below
tore
through
keyhole
like
water
through
a
fire
hose
one
at
a
time
we
attempted
to
crawl
through
but
it
hurled
us
back
together
each
holding
to
his
fellow
we
braced
against
the
side
walls
clung
to
little
nubs
on
the
floor
and
edged
forward
an
inch
at
a
time
even
so
we
were
blown
back
like
so
much
chaff
we
dropped
back
down
below
keyhole
and
creeping
beneath
some
rocks
waited
for
daylight
no
matter
how
far
we
crawled
beneath
the
jumbled
slabs
the
wind
found
us
out
we
shivered
all
huddled
together
for
warmth
and
waited
for
dawn
to
light
our
way
and
to
calm
the
hurricane
at
daybreak
we
managed
to
get
through
keyhole
and
made
our
way
to
the
trough
where
we
separated
cooper
and
piltz
following
the
trail
to
the
top
while
i
descended
the
trough
toward
glacier
gorge
we
had
agreed
to
watch
for
silent
signals
since
it
was
impossible
to
hear
even
the
loudest
calls
more
than
a
few
feet
in
a
little
patch
of
sand
not
much
larger
than
my
hand
i
discovered
a
human
footprint
with
a
dog
track
imposed
upon
it
i
wigwagged
to
my
companions
received
their
answering
signal
and
went
on
down
the
trough
whistling
to
the
dog
and
shouting
his
name
though
i
could
not
hope
he
would
hear
me
above
that
gale
i
searched
beneath
every
likely
slab
as
i
went
suddenly
the
dog
appeared
atop
a
huge
rock
he
howled
in
answer
to
my
call
the
wind
blew
him
off
his
post
and
he
disappeared
i
hastened
forward
then
paused
what
would
i
find
beneath
the
rock
resolutely
i
started
to
crawl
beneath
it
and
met
miss
broughm
coming
out
she
was
cold
her
lips
were
blue
and
cracked
but
she
had
not
given
up
hopes
or
lost
her
courage
with
her
hair
blowing
like
the
frayed
remnants
of
a
flag
she
stood
beside
the
bowlder
and
smiled
a
brave
if
twisted
smile
she
was
too
cold
to
walk
unaided
so
as
soon
as
the
others
came
up
we
all
supported
her
and
started
upon
the
return
trip
we
reached
the
hotel
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
with
our
lost
lady
still
smiling
wanly
but
rapidly
recovering
the
use
of
her
limbs
she
retired
for
a
few
hours
and
reappeared
in
time
for
luncheon
little
the
worse
for
her
night
out
on
top
of
the
world
a
compass
is
limited
in
its
usefulness
partly
because
it
is
sometimes
though
rarely
affected
by
mineral
deposits
and
goes
wrong
but
mostly
because
a
lost
person
seldom
thinks
he
is
lost
and
traveling
in
the
wrong
direction
but
instead
doubts
the
accuracy
of
the
compass
at
most
he
will
admit
he
is
off
the
trail
but
he
does
not
think
that
is
synonymous
with
being
lost
his
tracks
will
record
the
uncertainty
of
his
mind
wavering
haphazard
indefinite
but
he
will
not
admit
even
to
himself
that
he
is
lost
there
are
a
few
general
rules
followed
by
searchers
for
lost
people
if
the
proposed
destination
or
general
direction
in
which
they
disappeared
is
known
the
rescuers
take
the
trail
and
track
them
every
trail
even
across
windswept
bare
rocks
high
above
the
timberline
as
is
the
long
peak
trail
has
occasional
deposits
of
soft
sand
in
which
footprints
may
be
imprinted
and
as
i
have
said
before
the
area
which
must
be
searched
is
restricted
by
confining
cliffs
and
ridges
a
lost
person
who
can
not
find
his
way
back
over
the
trail
he
has
come
shows
wisdom
in
following
down
a
stream
which
will
eventually
bring
him
to
habitations
in
the
valley
below
whether
or
not
searching
parties
start
out
at
once
for
the
unfortunate
climber
depends
on
the
character
of
the
country
he
was
bound
for
if
his
goal
is
the
summit
of
a
high
bleak
peak
like
long
or
a
glacier
it
is
imperative
to
start
at
once
as
the
temperature
above
the
timberline
is
often
below
freezing
even
during
the
summer
months
but
if
the
country
is
not
so
menacing
the
searchers
delay
hoping
the
lost
person
like
bo
peep
sheep
will
come
home
unsought
as
indeed
he
generally
does
most
of
the
lost
are
found
but
a
few
persons
have
vanished
never
to
be
seen
again
the
reverend
sampson
disappeared
supposedly
somewhere
along
the
continental
divide
between
estes
park
and
grand
lake
and
though
parties
made
up
of
guides
rangers
and
settlers
searched
for
more
than
a
week
they
found
no
trace
of
the
missing
man
i
was
in
the
town
of
walden
north
park
late
one
fall
when
a
woodsman
came
down
from
the
mountains
west
of
the
park
with
some
human
bones
he
had
found
near
the
top
of
the
divide
by
the
marks
on
its
barrel
the
rusty
rifle
lying
near
the
bones
was
identified
as
one
belonging
to
a
man
who
had
been
lost
while
on
a
hunting
trip
thirty
years
before
one
moonlight
night
i
had
an
extraordinary
and
ludicrous
experience
with
a
lost
person
though
at
the
time
it
seemed
only
exasperating
i
had
stepped
outside
my
cabin
to
drink
in
the
moonshine
on
my
superb
outlook
across
the
valley
as
clearly
as
in
daylight
long
peak
and
its
neighbors
stood
out
the
little
meadow
brook
shimmered
like
a
silver
ribbon
i
walked
out
to
cabin
rock
a
thousand
feet
above
the
valley
and
sat
down
coyotes
their
salutations
to
the
sailing
moon
the
murmur
of
the
little
brooks
rose
to
my
ears
subdued
distant
i
listened
for
each
familiar
night
sound
as
one
does
for
the
voices
of
old
friends
i
sat
entranced
intoxicated
with
the
beauty
of
the
hour
refreshing
my
soul
at
peace
content
a
strange
cry
startled
me
from
my
reverie
a
human
cry
faint
as
though
far
off
help
then
a
pause
then
more
urgently
for
a
few
minutes
i
sat
still
upon
my
crag
puzzling
some
one
has
stumbled
into
a
bear
trap
i
thought
or
been
injured
in
a
fall
after
marking
the
locality
from
which
the
calls
came
i
ran
down
my
zigzag
trail
and
hastened
down
the
valley
toward
the
spot
whence
the
cries
had
come
whenever
i
came
to
the
open
parklike
clearings
i
stopped
to
listen
the
floor
of
the
wide
valley
had
been
burned
over
scores
of
years
before
and
a
new
growth
of
pines
covered
it
these
trees
were
of
nearly
uniform
height
about
fifteen
feet
and
in
places
too
dense
to
permit
of
passage
three
miles
were
covered
in
record
time
then
thinking
that
i
must
be
close
to
the
spot
from
which
the
calls
had
come
i
climbed
an
upthrust
of
rock
searched
the
openings
among
the
trees
near
by
and
listened
intently
i
shouted
no
reply
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
i
waited
then
from
far
up
the
valley
close
below
my
cabin
the
distressing
calls
were
repeated
he
certainly
not
crippled
i
thought
he
traveled
nearly
as
far
as
i
i
set
off
at
a
run
for
i
know
every
little
angle
of
the
woods
in
the
vicinity
but
when
i
arrived
breathless
and
panting
there
was
no
answer
to
my
shouts
i
gave
up
the
chase
in
disgust
and
started
up
the
trail
toward
my
cabin
i
decided
some
one
was
having
fun
with
me
midway
up
the
trail
to
my
cabin
i
heard
the
cries
again
agonized
fearful
they
came
from
across
the
valley
toward
the
west
heading
for
the
peaks
i
must
stop
him
it
certainly
sounded
serious
have
to
see
it
through
i
hurried
across
the
valley
shouting
at
intervals
stopping
to
listen
and
to
look
for
the
person
in
distress
there
was
no
answer
no
one
in
sight
as
i
reached
the
steep
slope
leading
upward
to
the
high
peaks
i
heard
terrified
cries
southward
toward
the
spot
from
which
the
first
call
had
come
it
was
strange
and
maddening
that
i
could
hear
him
so
distinctly
yet
he
could
not
hear
me
he
was
certainly
deaf
or
very
stupid
for
he
continued
calling
for
help
when
help
was
pursuing
him
and
yelling
at
the
top
of
its
lungs
again
calls
this
time
straight
south
of
my
position
it
was
a
riddle
annoying
yet
interesting
never
in
my
mountain
experience
had
i
encountered
such
a
mystifying
situation
however
with
grim
determination
but
little
enthusiasm
i
turned
south
my
curiosity
was
aroused
i
wanted
to
see
what
sort
of
fool
ran
around
in
dizzy
circles
yelling
for
help
yet
not
waiting
for
an
answer
to
his
supplications
nor
acknowledging
my
answering
shouts
i
was
in
prime
condition
and
well
warmed
up
with
ten
miles
of
travel
my
endurance
was
too
much
for
the
as
for
the
second
time
i
neared
the
spot
from
which
he
had
first
called
he
shattered
the
silence
with
lusty
appeals
then
broke
cover
within
a
hundred
yards
of
where
i
followed
hot
on
his
trail
he
looked
and
goodness
knows
he
been
active
so
i
withdrew
into
the
shadows
of
a
thicket
to
watch
what
he
would
do
after
his
outcry
he
kept
mumbling
to
himself
his
words
were
inaudible
lost
his
voice
do
wonder
some
rooter
he
make
at
a
football
game
while
he
lasted
after
muttering
a
minute
he
stopped
and
listened
intently
as
though
expecting
an
answer
good
heavens
he
thinks
he
can
be
heard
he
moved
on
staggering
crazily
stumbling
stopping
to
look
at
the
shining
peaks
then
going
on
aimlessly
loco
i
decided
i
circled
ahead
of
him
and
concealed
myself
behind
an
old
stump
i
wanted
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
twice
he
had
crossed
the
road
that
ran
down
the
valley
the
only
road
in
that
vicinity
from
cabin
rock
i
had
seen
a
tent
beside
it
as
he
came
toward
me
i
stepped
from
behind
the
stump
what
in
time
ails
you
i
roared
he
stared
at
me
and
walked
completely
around
me
before
saying
a
word
huh
he
grunted
then
where
you
come
from
i
explained
with
considerable
emphasis
that
i
had
come
from
almost
every
point
of
the
compass
will
you
tell
me
why
in
sam
hill
you
are
yelling
for
help
when
it
as
light
as
day
i
demanded
hotly
i
lost
he
said
meekly
lost
i
yelled
he
nodded
shamefacedly
went
fishing
and
could
find
my
camp
again
he
confessed
i
recalled
the
tent
beside
the
road
i
seen
from
cabin
rock
it
was
the
only
camp
on
the
only
road
in
the
vicinity
why
in
thunder
did
you
follow
the
road
did
know
which
way
to
go
he
defended
there
the
peak
i
gibed
pointing
upward
plain
as
day
your
camp
is
straight
east
of
it
did
you
know
that
he
winced
but
did
not
answer
could
you
see
the
peak
i
insisted
you
could
help
but
recognize
it
yes
he
admitted
i
saw
the
peak
but
i
thought
it
was
in
the
wrong
place
chapter
twelve
dreamers
of
golden
dreams
what
with
my
hunting
trapping
exploring
and
guiding
my
boyish
dreams
of
striking
it
rich
and
sending
home
trainloads
of
glittering
nuggets
to
my
parents
who
had
been
frustrated
by
illness
in
their
trek
across
the
plains
to
the
golden
mountains
of
colorado
began
to
fade
into
the
background
i
was
engrossed
in
getting
acquainted
with
my
wild
neighbors
in
learning
their
habits
and
customs
and
in
trying
to
photograph
them
in
their
natural
habitat
moreover
there
was
no
rich
gold
ore
in
the
vicinity
of
my
cabin
though
i
was
greatly
disappointed
in
this
fact
at
the
time
i
have
since
become
reconciled
to
it
after
seeing
the
naked
desolate
country
around
central
city
cripple
creek
ouray
and
other
mining
localities
i
am
thankful
that
no
such
madness
will
ever
tempt
men
to
despoil
the
beauties
of
the
region
around
estes
park
but
if
there
was
no
paying
gold
in
the
vicinity
there
were
plenty
of
prospectors
the
slopes
above
the
parson
ranch
were
gophered
all
over
by
them
there
were
miles
of
outcrop
showing
and
all
bore
traces
of
gold
every
summer
some
wanderer
came
probing
among
the
countless
holes
sure
he
find
riches
where
others
had
failed
the
most
persistent
one
was
called
old
mac
who
returned
repeatedly
late
one
fall
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
a
log
cabin
belonging
to
a
mining
company
the
cabin
stood
near
long
peak
trail
at
an
altitude
of
about
ten
thousand
feet
there
they
had
cached
some
supplies
old
mac
forever
dreaming
stumbled
on
to
the
cache
and
decided
to
take
up
his
residence
there
through
october
and
november
i
saw
old
mac
frequently
as
he
pottered
about
the
mine
or
picked
up
ore
samples
from
the
dump
he
staked
half
a
dozen
claims
marked
their
locations
and
dug
some
new
holes
to
test
the
mineral
in
december
when
deep
snows
came
i
left
the
region
when
i
returned
in
the
spring
the
snow
lay
deep
and
undisturbed
about
the
old
cabin
evidently
old
mac
had
got
out
before
winter
set
in
however
i
shouted
his
name
more
in
the
spirit
of
talking
to
myself
than
of
expecting
a
reply
i
was
surprised
to
hear
a
faint
reply
from
inside
the
cabin
came
a
creaking
as
though
some
one
were
getting
out
of
bed
then
the
door
opened
and
the
old
man
blinking
owlishly
stood
before
me
his
long
white
hair
was
unkempt
and
tangled
he
yawned
and
stretched
like
a
bear
emerging
from
its
winter
hibernation
came
up
to
bring
them
papers
he
asked
expectantly
i
recalled
then
when
i
last
saw
him
in
december
that
he
had
asked
to
borrow
some
denver
papers
that
contained
information
about
the
reno
gold
rush
i
had
forgotten
about
them
i
explained
and
apologized
what
sort
of
a
winter
have
you
put
in
i
asked
by
way
of
diverting
him
he
looked
at
me
in
a
sort
of
maze
winter
he
mumbled
perplexed
it
sure
settin
in
like
it
meant
business
but
i
plannin
to
start
a
tunnel
got
a
rich
vein
i
want
to
uncover
think
come
spring
i
have
her
where
somebody
want
to
build
a
mill
an
but
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
reno
i
recalled
yep
i
am
come
spring
he
earnestly
assured
me
do
you
know
the
date
i
shot
at
him
he
looked
at
me
sheepishly
do
reckon
i
do
he
admitted
scratching
his
head
and
eying
me
quizzically
i
waited
must
be
about
christmas
ai
it
he
guessed
at
length
it
was
the
eighth
of
may
old
mac
was
a
typical
prospector
they
are
all
queer
picturesque
characters
living
in
a
world
of
golden
dreams
oblivious
to
everything
but
the
hole
they
are
digging
the
gold
they
are
sure
to
find
they
have
a
fanatical
unshakable
perennial
faith
in
every
prospect
hole
they
open
no
matter
how
many
have
been
false
leads
they
are
incorrigible
optimists
the
world
champion
hopers
unkempt
unhurried
dreaming
confiding
trustful
superstitious
they
wander
the
length
of
the
rockies
seeking
the
materialization
of
their
golden
visions
they
are
seekers
far
more
concerned
with
finding
gold
than
with
digging
it
out
like
hunting
dogs
their
interest
ceases
with
the
capture
of
their
quarry
they
do
not
care
whether
the
region
they
propose
to
search
has
been
scientifically
tested
and
thought
to
contain
gold
they
adhere
to
the
miner
adage
gold
is
where
you
find
it
and
they
seem
to
have
some
occult
power
of
divination
for
they
have
uncovered
fabulous
fortunes
in
regions
which
like
cripple
creek
had
been
declared
barren
of
gold
yet
as
the
old
settlers
say
prospectors
never
get
anything
out
of
their
finds
having
struck
it
rich
they
take
to
the
trail
again
to
search
endlessly
to
probe
ceaselessly
with
patient
faith
the
inscrutable
hills
in
addition
to
their
seemingly
occult
power
of
divining
the
location
of
earth
hidden
treasure
these
rugged
old
men
of
the
mountains
possess
a
mysterious
means
of
learning
news
of
gold
strikes
let
a
bonanza
strike
be
made
and
every
prospector
in
the
region
will
be
on
his
way
to
the
new
camp
within
a
few
hours
how
did
you
know
that
gold
had
been
struck
at
caribou
i
asked
an
old
man
whom
i
met
on
the
trail
driving
his
pack
burro
ahead
of
him
hurrying
considerably
for
a
prospector
he
looked
at
me
scratched
his
head
spanked
the
burro
and
started
on
no
doubt
regretting
his
discourteous
silence
he
turned
i
knowed
they
was
agoin
to
he
told
me
nearly
every
prospector
has
a
little
pack
burro
that
seems
to
absorb
all
the
patient
philosophy
of
its
master
to
his
shaggy
he
gives
his
last
flapjack
tells
his
golden
dreams
confides
the
location
of
rich
veins
of
ore
and
turns
for
comfort
when
the
false
lead
plays
out
the
knowing
animal
provides
that
rarest
of
companionship
a
sympathetic
silent
attentive
listener
most
of
the
prospectors
i
have
met
on
the
trails
were
old
men
working
alone
but
two
do
sometimes
cast
their
lot
together
and
become
partners
the
story
i
heard
told
once
around
a
campfire
of
two
old
prospectors
who
were
always
quarreling
is
characteristic
many
times
they
separated
each
to
go
his
own
way
sometimes
they
merely
set
up
separate
camps
a
few
yards
apart
refusing
to
speak
or
to
take
any
notice
of
each
other
thus
they
bickered
fought
and
made
up
close
to
forty
years
they
staked
claims
wherever
they
discovered
promising
outcrop
they
were
familiar
with
a
hundred
miles
of
ragged
mountain
ranges
after
all
those
years
old
and
failing
they
fell
out
over
some
trivial
thing
and
separated
for
good
one
traveled
north
the
other
south
both
struck
fine
mineral
that
promised
to
make
their
dreams
come
true
but
neither
was
content
each
wanted
the
other
companionship
and
yet
each
feared
that
pride
would
keep
his
poor
partner
from
accepting
his
advances
they
grew
morose
and
finally
both
blew
up
their
holdings
to
conceal
their
riches
and
headed
back
along
the
divide
to
meet
face
to
face
the
partner
they
had
deserted
prospectors
are
philosophers
without
hurry
or
worry
they
meet
each
situation
as
it
arises
calmly
and
let
take
care
of
its
own
when
food
and
dynamite
give
out
they
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
foothill
towns
and
with
alluring
tales
of
leads
lodes
and
veins
of
hidden
treasure
soon
to
be
revealed
just
as
soon
as
they
have
time
to
do
a
little
more
development
work
they
secure
another
grub
stake
and
are
on
their
way
to
high
country
again
they
always
find
willing
listeners
for
the
heart
of
many
a
less
daring
conservative
business
man
is
in
the
hills
the
listeners
are
easily
inveigled
into
staking
these
old
beggars
hypnotized
and
hypnotizing
with
dreams
and
do
it
again
and
again
gambling
on
the
next
strike
being
a
lucky
one
the
man
who
furnishes
a
grub
stake
shares
half
and
half
with
the
prospector
he
equips
no
matter
how
little
they
have
prospectors
will
share
with
anyone
who
comes
their
way
their
hospitality
is
genuine
though
perforce
limited
they
invite
you
first
and
learn
who
you
are
and
what
your
business
may
be
later
one
day
i
was
picking
my
way
down
the
bogs
and
marshes
of
forest
cañon
all
at
once
it
narrowed
boxing
up
between
high
walls
to
go
on
i
had
either
to
climb
the
walls
or
for
some
distance
i
elected
to
climb
after
the
struggle
up
the
face
of
the
rock
i
sat
down
to
rest
no
one
within
miles
i
panted
as
i
sat
down
do
look
like
there
ever
been
anyone
here
i
added
as
i
recalled
the
way
i
had
come
what
ya
take
me
fur
ten
feet
away
standing
motionless
beside
an
old
stump
stood
a
cadaverous
fellow
whose
rags
suggested
the
moss
that
hung
from
the
trees
hungry
he
shot
at
me
before
i
recovered
from
my
surprise
right
hyar
he
led
the
way
with
all
the
poise
of
a
gentleman
but
his
camp
beside
an
old
tunnel
that
plunged
beneath
the
side
wall
of
the
cañon
was
a
upon
green
boughs
were
spread
a
single
pair
of
ragged
blankets
his
campfire
still
smoldered
upon
its
coals
were
his
only
culinary
utensils
an
old
tin
bucket
in
which
simmered
his
coffee
and
a
gold
pan
containing
a
stew
the
pan
had
seen
better
days
and
worse
ones
too
for
one
side
of
its
rim
was
gone
and
the
bottom
had
been
cleverly
turned
up
to
form
a
new
one
making
it
with
a
straight
side
prospectin
my
host
ventured
eying
me
dreamily
no
lookin
i
told
him
humph
then
hope
you
find
it
but
his
curiosity
ended
there
say
if
you
wantin
ter
see
good
looka
that
he
tossed
over
a
piece
of
quartz
got
er
whole
mountain
uf
it
he
jerked
his
head
toward
the
tunnel
he
lowered
his
voice
glanced
around
beckoned
me
to
follow
and
led
the
way
inside
his
mine
at
the
edge
of
the
darkness
he
halted
returned
to
the
entrance
and
peered
about
then
he
leaned
close
that
none
might
hear
and
whispered
the
secret
the
old
old
secret
no
prospector
ever
keeps
not
that
prospectors
have
anything
to
keep
another
time
in
the
rough
region
west
of
ypsilon
mountain
i
came
upon
a
lean
wiry
little
old
man
leading
a
burro
he
jerked
at
the
lead
rope
in
vain
attempt
to
hurry
the
phlegmatic
animal
com
on
durn
ye
he
squeaked
as
he
tugged
at
the
rope
do
ye
know
we
tracin
the
float
lead
right
close
now
but
the
burro
was
of
little
faith
he
had
lost
his
youthful
enthusiasm
he
carried
all
his
master
possessions
except
his
golden
dreams
on
his
back
but
his
pack
was
light
so
engrossed
was
the
old
man
that
he
passed
within
fifty
yards
of
where
i
sat
without
seeing
me
he
was
oblivious
to
everything
but
what
might
lie
hidden
on
the
mountainside
the
float
would
lead
to
a
bonanza
strike
a
mill
would
be
built
to
handle
the
ore
a
town
would
spring
up
his
town
named
in
his
honor
as
the
discoverer
of
the
lead
he
mumbled
of
these
things
as
he
worked
sometimes
he
paused
looking
abstractedly
at
the
peaks
above
without
apparently
seeing
them
at
all
he
babbled
incoherently
of
leads
floats
lodes
and
veins
his
actions
were
like
those
of
a
dog
puzzling
out
the
faint
trail
of
a
rabbit
that
had
crossed
and
crisscrossed
its
own
trail
until
nothing
could
track
it
down
somewhere
on
the
mountain
above
was
the
source
of
the
float
the
old
man
edged
up
the
slope
tacking
back
and
forth
across
the
line
of
scattered
quartz
he
located
the
vein
at
last
by
trenching
through
a
carpet
of
spruce
needles
he
set
up
camp
and
started
digging
so
i
dropped
down
the
cañon
towards
the
poudre
river
but
a
week
later
upon
my
return
he
was
still
there
he
had
located
his
claim
and
staked
his
corner
his
location
notice
laboriously
written
with
a
blunt
pencil
was
fastened
to
a
tree
the
burro
lay
in
philosophical
contemplation
in
the
grass
beside
the
stream
while
his
master
sat
beside
the
shallow
hole
that
perhaps
marked
the
beginning
of
a
mine
his
pose
was
that
of
a
sentinel
he
watched
the
hole
with
an
expectant
air
as
though
from
it
something
important
would
presently
emerge
and
he
was
waiting
to
pounce
upon
it
years
later
when
i
passed
that
way
again
the
hole
was
no
deeper
but
the
frayed
remnants
of
the
location
notice
flapped
in
the
breeze
only
once
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
have
i
seen
a
prospector
hurry
it
was
while
i
was
guiding
a
party
of
eastern
folks
across
the
rabbit
ear
range
that
we
met
a
gangling
fellow
named
shorty
by
way
of
contrast
i
say
he
was
hurrying
because
he
held
a
straight
course
across
the
mountains
without
paying
heed
to
numberless
diverting
leads
he
ordinarily
would
have
sampled
shorty
was
heading
for
central
city
where
mining
had
been
in
full
blast
for
forty
years
he
had
no
burro
he
had
cached
his
tools
at
the
scene
of
his
last
camp
he
had
had
a
dream
that
revealed
to
him
the
location
of
a
rich
vein
right
in
the
midst
of
miles
of
mines
but
unsuspected
and
undiscovered
every
prospector
has
dreams
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
my
party
loaned
shorty
some
grub
and
watched
him
disappear
toward
the
mecca
of
his
dreams
just
before
he
left
shorty
confided
to
us
that
his
dream
vein
lay
just
below
a
big
bowlder
and
above
some
tall
trees
that
he
knew
the
vein
was
right
there
and
it
was
to
my
cabin
one
day
came
pete
who
dwelt
in
a
realm
of
unreality
pete
was
superstitious
after
the
manner
of
his
tribe
he
knew
all
the
luck
signs
all
the
charms
good
or
bad
and
he
had
conjured
up
against
ill
omens
as
he
approached
my
cabin
a
visiting
cat
a
black
one
crossed
his
path
pete
promptly
turned
around
three
times
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
the
cat
had
gone
and
calmly
entered
secure
in
his
belief
that
he
had
broken
pussy
dark
spell
he
was
afflicted
with
rheumatism
which
prevented
him
from
prospecting
at
length
he
figured
out
the
cause
of
his
trouble
and
a
cure
for
it
it
was
dampness
or
rainy
weather
he
told
me
but
came
from
camping
near
mineral
deposits
if
he
chanced
to
pitch
his
camp
near
mineral
especially
iron
it
caused
his
rheumatics
to
come
on
for
protection
he
bought
a
compass
with
which
we
went
over
proposed
camp
sites
if
the
compass
showed
variation
or
disturbance
he
abandoned
the
site
and
once
when
the
compass
was
out
of
order
he
camped
unconsciously
at
a
spot
where
there
was
iron
then
as
his
rheumatism
developed
he
found
that
his
watch
had
stopped
later
when
his
aches
at
last
left
him
his
watch
started
ticking
of
its
own
accord
his
watch
was
so
sympathetic
that
it
could
bear
to
run
when
he
could
walk
but
when
he
felt
good
it
was
so
joyous
it
ran
ahead
to
make
up
for
lost
time
then
he
set
it
right
by
squinting
at
the
sun
no
matter
what
queer
beliefs
prospectors
have
they
are
never
disgruntled
i
had
camped
near
the
old
flattop
trail
at
a
spot
where
sometime
before
i
had
cached
some
food
supplies
it
was
early
in
september
no
wind
reached
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
where
i
slept
beside
my
fire
i
awoke
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
and
sleepily
i
opened
my
eyes
no
one
would
be
traveling
at
night
surely
i
had
been
dreaming
but
no
there
was
movement
if
i
kin
git
the
hole
ten
feet
deeper
before
snow
flies
i
have
something
to
show
that
ole
skinflint
at
the
lake
i
sat
up
wondering
then
i
remembered
the
voice
it
was
old
sutton
a
prospector
i
had
known
for
many
years
one
of
the
typical
plodding
babbling
old
fellows
who
live
only
in
their
dreams
my
camp
was
in
the
shelter
of
small
spruces
while
my
visitor
stood
in
the
open
playfully
i
picked
up
an
empty
tin
can
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
that
it
might
fall
close
beside
him
at
the
fall
of
the
can
the
man
spun
around
suddenly
and
walking
over
to
it
prodded
it
with
the
stick
he
carried
gosh
dern
he
exclaimed
funny
how
things
happen
he
stood
in
silence
looking
down
at
the
can
then
i
dropped
another
close
to
him
he
muttered
something
unintelligible
the
third
and
fourth
cans
made
him
hop
around
like
a
surprised
robin
beneath
an
apple
tree
with
fruit
pelting
the
ground
near
it
at
length
he
hobbled
off
talking
to
himself
about
a
new
lead
he
had
found
without
solving
the
mystery
of
the
tin
cans
dropping
from
a
clear
night
sky
chapter
thirteen
the
city
of
silence
for
days
i
had
been
on
the
trail
or
rather
off
it
for
there
were
no
trails
in
the
high
country
through
which
i
was
traveling
excepting
those
made
by
game
i
was
hungry
the
region
lacked
charm
it
is
difficult
for
a
boy
to
appreciate
scenery
on
a
empty
stomach
which
he
has
been
urging
up
mountains
and
joggling
down
valleys
had
the
bunnies
been
more
accommodating
and
gone
into
their
holes
so
i
could
snare
them
or
smoke
them
out
or
the
grouse
had
been
less
flighty
when
i
flushed
them
and
remained
near
enough
so
i
could
reach
them
with
my
stones
i
might
have
stretched
my
food
supply
over
the
extended
time
of
my
unexpectedly
prolonged
travels
but
no
such
good
luck
attended
me
on
that
excursion
the
very
first
day
i
slipped
off
a
while
crossing
a
saucy
little
mountain
brook
and
bruised
my
shin
tore
my
trousers
and
injured
my
camera
like
most
small
boys
i
regretted
that
gratuitous
bath
i
began
to
wonder
if
pete
was
so
crazy
after
all
now
the
clouds
were
pinning
themselves
up
to
dry
on
the
pointed
summits
of
the
peaks
and
were
already
beginning
to
drip
on
the
world
below
darkness
threatened
to
set
in
early
i
knew
i
ought
to
stop
and
make
camp
while
it
was
still
light
enough
to
see
but
i
kept
on
going
hoping
something
might
turn
up
my
empty
stomach
growled
its
disapproval
but
i
stubbornly
ignored
its
protests
while
my
better
judgment
my
stomach
and
myself
were
all
three
arguing
i
thought
i
glimpsed
a
building
far
down
on
the
slope
below
too
excited
to
say
i
told
you
so
to
my
companions
i
quickened
my
steps
and
headed
toward
it
a
prospector
if
he
has
any
grub
at
all
he
share
it
and
i
be
protected
from
this
downpour
by
that
time
the
celestial
laundresses
were
emptying
out
their
wash
tubs
and
sloshing
water
all
over
the
earth
when
i
drew
near
the
shack
i
discovered
it
was
one
of
a
group
of
straggling
houses
scattered
along
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
gulch
a
settlement
it
was
dark
by
then
yet
not
a
light
could
i
see
must
go
to
bed
with
the
chickens
i
mused
i
hope
they
wo
mind
being
gotten
up
to
give
a
wayfarer
shelter
and
a
bite
to
eat
on
my
way
down
the
slope
i
passed
two
or
three
log
cabins
but
these
were
silent
apparently
empty
and
i
hastened
on
to
the
main
group
which
faced
on
the
single
road
that
ran
along
the
bottom
of
the
gulch
intending
to
knock
at
the
first
which
showed
signs
of
life
i
walked
the
length
of
the
sprawling
road
looking
sharply
at
each
house
listening
for
voices
a
chance
word
or
a
peal
of
laughter
not
a
sound
greeted
my
ears
except
the
thud
of
rain
upon
sod
roofs
the
drip
of
water
through
stunted
scraggly
trees
here
was
something
queer
i
thought
of
pete
and
his
luck
charms
i
regretted
more
than
ever
that
i
had
not
got
a
single
bunny
i
felt
the
need
of
a
rabbit
foot
shaking
myself
to
shed
rain
and
forebodings
i
crossed
the
street
and
knocked
boldly
upon
the
door
of
the
nearest
house
there
was
no
response
again
i
knocked
louder
and
more
insistently
my
raps
came
echoing
back
emptily
i
knocked
again
a
door
creaking
on
rusty
hinges
swung
slowly
inward
but
no
one
peered
out
inviting
me
to
enter
i
backed
away
from
the
yawning
cavern
blacker
than
the
starless
night
into
the
open
road
a
little
owl
seeking
as
i
was
supper
swooped
by
on
muffled
wings
and
sawed
wood
saying
nothing
i
jeered
back
at
him
and
felt
my
courage
rising
i
stepped
up
resolutely
to
the
next
house
and
beat
upon
its
door
there
was
instant
commotion
a
rattling
of
pans
the
clink
of
dishes
as
though
some
one
hurried
to
the
door
straightening
up
and
facing
the
door
expectantly
i
smiled
in
anticipation
of
a
hospitable
welcome
then
the
sounds
ceased
my
courage
oozed
away
an
unreasonable
fear
crept
over
me
i
lost
my
desire
for
food
and
rest
i
would
as
soon
have
rested
in
a
grave
once
more
i
stood
in
the
rutted
street
searching
its
brief
length
for
a
human
form
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
were
somewhere
about
that
they
had
just
stepped
out
leaving
their
doors
unlocked
against
their
early
return
perhaps
there
was
a
dance
or
a
celebration
of
some
sort
in
the
neighboring
village
strange
some
one
did
stay
behind
the
sudden
eerie
notes
of
a
coyote
caused
my
hair
to
lift
why
the
brute
respect
the
silence
the
wind
stirred
uneasily
doors
banged
about
me
the
uncanny
spell
of
the
place
overcame
my
last
shred
of
courage
my
feet
started
down
the
road
of
their
own
volition
i
found
myself
breathing
hard
running
fast
i
jerked
to
a
standstill
laughing
sheepishly
at
my
fears
ashamed
then
i
faced
about
determined
to
stay
something
touched
my
elbows
i
sprang
ten
feet
and
whirled
on
the
defensive
a
dark
horned
form
stood
before
me
my
muscles
tensed
for
another
sprint
i
held
my
breath
the
thing
moved
i
made
out
the
outline
of
a
burro
i
breathed
again
relieved
here
at
last
was
something
alive
something
natural
in
this
desert
of
silence
i
wished
the
animal
would
bray
but
he
only
nosed
my
pockets
suggestively
i
laid
my
hand
upon
him
gratefully
and
found
he
too
was
in
sore
straits
his
coat
as
ragged
as
my
own
his
sides
corrugated
like
a
huge
washboard
my
spirits
rose
my
forebodings
were
forgotten
hello
i
called
joyfully
what
are
you
doing
here
again
he
smelled
my
pockets
wagging
his
great
ears
the
while
then
waited
expectantly
sorry
pal
i
apologized
the
little
beggar
attitude
expressed
such
dejection
i
laughed
never
mind
old
fellow
we
go
find
something
there
must
be
somebody
here
i
started
out
to
renew
my
search
and
he
followed
at
my
heels
so
together
we
wandered
down
the
street
on
a
tour
of
investigation
his
coat
was
so
black
that
often
i
could
not
distinguish
him
from
the
darker
shadows
that
filled
the
street
at
every
door
he
crowded
forward
expectantly
focusing
his
long
ears
as
though
to
catch
the
first
salutation
nearly
every
door
was
ajar
the
log
cabins
were
small
two
or
three
rooms
at
the
most
and
easily
searched
their
owners
had
apparently
taken
only
their
most
portable
and
necessary
possessions
for
nearly
every
cabin
contained
something
of
value
bed
springs
bunks
suspended
by
wire
from
the
rafters
tables
chairs
dishes
cooking
utensils
even
miners
tools
one
had
a
row
of
books
upon
its
stone
mantel
when
we
came
to
the
one
where
sounds
had
answered
my
knocking
i
paused
before
the
door
hesitating
to
intrude
that
first
creepy
feeling
stole
over
me
i
put
my
hand
on
the
burro
neck
i
jerked
the
latchstring
and
pushed
open
the
door
the
room
was
dark
and
silent
when
i
struck
a
match
there
was
a
rapid
scurrying
of
rats
darting
for
shelter
my
burly
bodyguard
never
once
left
my
side
he
waited
patiently
for
my
report
when
i
emerged
from
each
cabin
and
accepted
with
philosophical
resignation
my
decision
to
postpone
further
search
till
daylight
early
next
morning
i
was
up
and
out
further
to
explore
the
village
no
one
had
returned
home
there
was
no
doubt
now
that
it
was
deserted
in
one
of
the
cabins
i
found
some
salt
which
i
divided
with
the
burro
another
yielded
a
little
flour
i
prepared
a
sticky
mixture
of
flour
and
water
seasoned
with
salt
and
cooked
it
in
one
of
the
fireplaces
when
baked
it
had
the
firmness
of
granite
but
my
appetite
had
a
cutting
edge
and
the
burro
no
more
particular
accepted
the
hardtack
and
crunched
it
greedily
after
breaking
our
fast
to
say
nothing
of
our
teeth
we
continued
our
yes
excavations
for
out
of
the
dust
and
neglect
of
years
of
desertion
we
dug
the
history
of
a
buried
past
of
a
forgotten
civilization
where
men
had
worked
women
had
loved
and
sacrificed
and
little
children
had
laughed
and
played
illustration
out
of
the
dust
of
years
we
dug
the
history
of
a
buried
past
one
of
the
houses
had
evidently
held
the
post
office
for
in
it
was
a
small
cabinet
holding
a
few
pieces
of
mail
addressed
to
various
persons
there
were
unopened
letters
and
papers
bearing
the
postmarks
of
towns
back
east
there
were
packages
showing
marks
of
long
journeys
still
intact
their
cords
still
tightly
knotted
many
of
the
letters
had
been
forwarded
from
other
western
post
offices
and
had
followed
the
men
to
whom
they
were
addressed
to
this
then
alive
town
named
teller
the
postmaster
had
apparently
been
a
notary
public
his
book
of
records
lay
dusty
on
the
shelf
near
what
had
been
the
post
office
upon
it
too
were
filed
copies
of
mining
claims
the
grizzly
king
decoration
day
lady
forty
queen
victoria
tom
boy
last
chance
deep
water
black
mule
hope
ever
fantastic
picturesque
names
suggesting
many
a
tale
of
romance
and
adventure
revealing
the
hopes
and
fears
of
daring
hearts
something
of
these
was
hinted
at
in
an
open
letter
lying
on
the
floor
of
one
of
the
cabins
it
was
worn
thin
where
it
had
been
creased
as
though
its
owner
had
long
carried
it
around
in
his
pocket
the
better
to
read
and
reread
it
the
wind
had
pried
into
it
leaving
it
spread
open
for
the
next
intruder
convenience
somehow
i
felt
those
frank
spirits
would
not
mind
my
reading
it
dear
fred
hope
you
strike
it
rich
in
teller
the
new
town
you
wrote
about
most
anything
out
there
would
beat
what
we
have
here
corn
is
all
dried
up
in
iowa
and
there
little
to
live
on
quite
a
lot
of
the
neighbors
have
pulled
up
stakes
and
moved
to
kansas
ten
wagons
left
last
week
following
the
road
west
which
so
many
have
taken
for
better
or
worse
the
last
and
smallest
cabin
in
the
town
was
as
clean
and
tidy
as
though
its
owner
might
have
been
gone
but
a
few
days
upon
the
table
was
a
worn
and
frayed
little
book
weighted
down
by
a
rough
piece
of
ore
a
sort
of
diary
and
yet
it
seemed
to
be
written
to
some
one
i
copied
extracts
from
it
into
my
own
notebook
my
dear
katherine
i
believe
i
struck
it
rich
at
last
there
was
a
rush
up
here
three
months
ago
and
i
came
in
soon
as
the
news
reached
cheyenne
must
have
been
several
hundred
in
the
race
to
get
here
first
about
twenty
of
us
won
out
i
filed
on
several
claims
and
tried
to
hire
men
to
help
me
do
assessment
work
but
no
one
would
work
for
wages
everyone
is
raving
crazy
bound
to
strike
it
rich
and
working
double
shift
to
hold
as
many
claims
as
possible
katy
dear
it
been
a
month
since
i
started
this
letter
things
have
settled
down
here
now
and
the
have
vanished
but
there
a
few
of
us
sticking
to
our
holes
with
the
notion
if
we
go
deep
enough
they
pan
out
rich
but
there
no
way
of
they
came
for
me
to
help
with
a
poor
fellow
who
got
hurt
when
his
tunnel
caved
in
on
him
guess
he
make
a
die
of
it
too
seems
terrible
just
when
he
thought
he
had
struck
a
bonanza
to
be
killed
that
way
makes
me
lonesome
to
think
how
things
turned
out
for
him
i
got
a
secret
cache
straight
west
of
my
cabin
steps
under
a
big
rock
i
hid
a
buckskin
sack
with
the
golddust
another
fellow
and
i
panned
from
a
bar
in
the
colorado
river
it
not
so
very
much
but
it
help
out
in
a
pinch
kate
this
camp
played
out
i
quitting
disgusted
after
all
the
hard
work
here
there
nothing
rich
just
stuff
that
pay
freighting
charges
maybe
if
we
had
a
mill
but
there
no
use
talking
mill
when
every
fellow
here
is
in
the
same
fix
on
his
last
legs
we
got
to
get
out
or
starve
we
all
living
on
deer
and
wild
sheep
but
its
getting
so
we
can
hardly
swallow
it
much
longer
let
you
know
as
soon
it
was
unfinished
the
sides
of
the
gulch
were
gophered
with
prospect
holes
most
of
them
very
shallow
with
little
mounds
of
dirt
beside
them
like
the
graves
of
dead
hopes
occasionally
a
deeper
hole
had
picked
samples
from
the
ore
vein
it
followed
piled
near
its
opening
likewise
outside
some
of
the
cabin
doors
were
little
heaps
of
choice
ore
which
hopeful
owners
had
brought
in
against
the
time
when
shipments
would
be
made
or
an
ore
mill
set
up
near
by
i
had
chanced
upon
an
abandoned
mining
town
left
forever
as
casually
as
though
its
residents
had
gone
to
call
upon
a
neighbor
there
are
many
such
in
the
mountains
of
colorado
during
the
early
gold
rushes
when
strikes
were
made
mining
towns
sprang
up
overnight
and
later
when
leads
played
out
or
failed
to
pan
out
profitably
or
rumor
of
a
richer
strike
reached
the
inhabitants
they
deserted
them
to
try
their
luck
in
new
fields
of
promise
often
they
were
eager
to
be
the
first
ones
in
on
the
new
finds
and
left
without
preparation
or
notice
trailing
across
mountains
and
through
cañons
afoot
each
anxious
to
be
the
first
man
on
the
ground
to
have
his
choice
of
location
to
stake
his
claim
first
they
could
not
carry
all
their
household
goods
on
their
shoulders
nor
pack
them
on
a
burro
back
and
to
freight
them
over
a
hundred
miles
of
mountain
trails
cost
more
than
the
purchase
of
new
goods
in
the
new
town
so
they
departed
with
only
such
necessities
as
they
could
carry
and
abandoned
the
rest
to
pack
rats
and
chance
wanderers
such
as
i
so
these
towns
born
of
their
high
hopes
died
as
their
dreams
flickered
out
and
were
abandoned
when
new
hopes
sprung
up
in
their
breasts
i
forgot
my
hunger
in
unraveling
the
mysteries
of
the
silent
village
but
my
companion
showed
no
such
inclination
being
a
pack
burro
and
having
a
prospector
for
a
master
he
had
come
to
look
upon
tragedy
with
a
philosophical
eye
no
doubt
he
had
seen
deserted
towns
before
and
been
the
innocent
victim
of
the
desertion
he
grew
bored
as
i
lingered
over
letters
and
the
other
evidence
of
bygone
days
and
nudged
me
frequently
to
remind
me
of
our
original
object
in
searching
the
cabins
at
last
he
protested
with
a
vigorous
remembering
his
loyalty
of
the
night
before
to
appease
him
i
left
off
rummaging
in
those
cabins
all
right
pal
i
come
we
leave
this
right
away
and
try
our
luck
at
fishing
he
seemed
to
understand
for
he
capered
about
like
a
playful
puppy
i
knew
of
several
small
streams
below
the
town
alive
with
trout
i
headed
for
the
nearest
one
the
burro
plodding
patiently
behind
silent
expectant
the
smell
of
smoke
coffee
and
other
camp
odors
came
up
the
trail
to
meet
us
soon
we
came
abruptly
in
sight
of
two
prospectors
who
were
eating
a
belated
breakfast
reckon
you
better
have
a
bite
with
us
invited
one
of
the
men
as
he
set
the
coffee
pot
upon
the
coals
of
their
fire
thet
thar
burro
bin
a
pesterin
you
asked
the
second
man
fixing
the
burro
with
a
searching
gaze
oh
no
i
denied
remembering
my
debt
to
the
animal
we
put
in
the
night
together
and
he
even
ate
some
of
my
hardtack
this
morning
i
ended
laughing
he
the
tarnationist
critter
always
a
galavantin
roun
an
a
gittin
inter
somebody
grub
the
burro
chose
to
overlook
these
insults
and
drew
near
the
fire
unostentatiously
the
old
prospector
slipped
him
part
of
his
breakfast
which
way
you
headin
asked
the
first
man
plainly
puzzled
because
i
carried
neither
gun
nor
mining
tools
to
climb
arapahoe
peak
climb
the
peak
he
repeated
much
mystified
what
the
idear
the
second
wanted
to
know
goin
way
off
thar
jes
to
git
up
a
mountain
when
thar
plenty
right
hyar
higher
ones
too
he
indicated
the
ranges
to
the
east
any
place
up
that
way
to
get
out
of
the
rain
i
asked
for
the
clouds
were
dropping
again
with
the
threat
of
gathering
storm
the
men
exchanged
glances
abruptly
the
small
one
got
to
his
feet
and
led
the
burro
out
of
sight
among
the
willows
the
other
man
faced
me
better
take
a
friend
advice
and
keep
outen
there
he
swept
a
grimy
hand
westward
what
up
better
do
your
climbin
round
hyar
he
replied
suggestively
but
i
want
to
climb
arapahoe
i
have
heard
the
indians
used
it
for
a
signal
mountain
and
he
beckoned
me
to
follow
and
led
the
way
into
the
grove
mysteriously
at
length
he
stopped
peered
about
uneasily
then
whispered
there
an
ole
cabin
up
yonder
he
faced
toward
arapahoe
haunted
my
interest
quickening
my
fears
of
the
depressing
night
forgotten
he
nodded
dead
earnest
are
you
sure
about
that
did
you
ever
see
the
the
his
look
silenced
me
ole
feller
died
up
thar
he
declared
nobody
knows
how
his
tone
was
awesome
i
made
a
move
down
the
trail
thanking
him
for
the
meal
would
go
if
i
wus
you
he
persisted
following
me
as
far
as
his
camp
then
as
i
took
the
unused
trail
that
led
down
toward
north
park
he
called
after
me
remember
i
warned
you
fishing
was
good
in
the
stream
a
few
miles
below
their
camp
and
i
soon
had
all
the
trout
i
wanted
and
was
on
my
way
to
the
round
dome
of
arapahoe
peak
jutting
above
some
clouds
that
were
banked
against
its
lower
slope
through
the
willow
flats
and
a
dense
forest
of
spruce
the
way
led
up
between
parallel
ridges
over
a
game
trail
deeply
worn
and
recently
used
i
was
right
upon
a
log
wall
before
i
knew
it
then
i
circled
and
saw
that
the
wall
was
part
of
an
old
cabin
built
in
a
little
opening
of
the
forest
a
section
of
the
roof
had
fallen
in
and
the
fireplace
had
lost
part
of
its
chimney
the
slab
door
had
a
broken
hinge
and
swayed
uneasily
on
the
one
remaining
and
the
dirt
floor
bore
no
traces
of
recent
habitation
having
gathered
wood
for
the
night
for
i
had
no
blankets
and
must
keep
the
fire
burning
i
broiled
several
trout
for
my
supper
how
i
relished
that
meal
supper
over
i
climbed
upon
a
cliff
behind
the
cabin
and
watched
the
moon
rise
silently
above
a
ridge
to
the
eastward
and
listened
to
the
faint
clamor
of
the
coyotes
far
below
shadows
crept
closer
to
the
cliffs
as
the
moon
climbed
higher
while
from
the
peaks
above
came
the
moaning
of
the
wind
never
had
been
such
a
night
it
was
late
when
i
went
inside
the
old
cabin
and
the
fire
had
burned
low
i
put
on
fresh
wood
removed
my
shoes
and
stretched
out
before
the
comforting
blaze
i
was
asleep
almost
instantly
from
time
to
time
as
had
become
my
habit
i
roused
enough
to
feed
the
fire
then
quickly
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
just
when
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
about
midnight
i
awoke
with
a
strange
feeling
that
an
unseen
presence
was
in
the
room
the
prospector
warning
came
to
me
vaguely
and
i
tried
to
rouse
up
to
listen
but
i
dropped
back
to
sleep
almost
immediately
later
coming
awake
suddenly
as
though
some
one
had
shaken
me
i
sat
up
and
rubbing
my
eyes
to
open
them
glanced
around
but
the
interior
of
the
cabin
was
dark
only
the
stars
sparkled
close
above
the
broken
roof
i
yawned
expansively
rolled
nearer
the
low
fire
and
fell
asleep
the
next
i
knew
i
heard
a
thud
close
to
my
head
and
i
was
wide
awake
upon
the
instant
i
lay
still
trying
to
convince
myself
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
cabin
but
myself
when
a
hot
breath
struck
my
face
i
got
up
on
end
so
did
my
hair
i
started
for
the
door
a
bulky
shadow
moved
between
it
and
myself
i
postponed
going
in
that
direction
for
the
moment
and
turning
felt
my
way
to
a
dark
corner
back
by
the
fireplace
from
the
corner
across
the
hearth
came
a
faint
sound
thinking
the
time
propitious
for
a
prompt
exit
i
felt
my
way
along
the
wall
turned
the
corner
and
made
for
the
door
unfortunately
my
uninvited
guest
had
the
same
thought
for
as
i
sprang
for
the
opening
i
bumped
into
him
and
the
creaky
slab
door
banged
shut
leaving
the
cabin
blacker
than
ever
an
idea
shot
through
my
head
if
the
visitor
whatever
it
was
or
otherwise
wanted
the
location
near
the
door
it
could
have
it
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
discourteous
i
groped
my
way
back
to
the
fireplace
stumbling
over
my
wood
as
i
went
i
had
a
fleeting
notion
to
fling
fresh
wood
on
the
fire
which
had
almost
burned
out
again
i
collided
with
my
dusky
visitor
i
hesitated
no
longer
i
would
vacate
the
cabin
instantly
for
good
and
all
without
stopping
to
gather
up
my
few
belongings
across
the
dirt
floor
i
dashed
grabbed
the
creaky
door
and
jerked
it
open
but
before
i
could
dart
through
i
was
shoved
aside
in
panic
i
sought
that
exit
but
was
buffeted
about
and
finally
knocked
headlong
on
the
ground
thoroughly
scared
i
leaped
to
my
feet
ready
to
run
standing
a
few
feet
in
front
of
me
big
ears
thrust
forward
inquiringly
was
the
friendly
burro
of
the
night
before
chapter
fourteen
bears
and
bugbears
in
my
childish
estimation
bear
stories
rivaled
the
tales
of
mad
gold
rushes
thundering
bisons
and
savage
indians
no
chore
was
so
hard
nor
so
long
but
that
i
managed
to
complete
it
in
time
to
take
my
place
in
the
fireside
circle
and
listen
to
accounts
of
those
huge
animals
that
lived
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
were
fiercer
than
any
other
bears
in
the
world
ursus
horribilis
my
father
called
them
and
a
delicious
little
shudder
would
run
down
my
back
at
the
sound
of
the
words
there
was
talk
too
of
hunters
who
had
tracked
these
monsters
to
their
lairs
and
overcome
them
early
i
decided
that
when
i
went
west
i
would
become
besides
other
things
a
mighty
bear
hunter
the
cows
i
drove
to
pasture
were
ursus
horribilis
how
i
reveled
in
those
words
fleeing
before
me
and
i
was
stalking
them
through
the
wilds
with
rifle
upon
my
arm
and
pistol
and
hunting
knife
in
my
belt
i
planned
to
discard
the
ragged
overalls
and
clumsy
clodhoppers
of
the
farm
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
mountains
for
buckskin
suit
and
moccasins
all
beaded
and
fringed
i
wondered
if
the
indians
wore
coonskin
caps
like
davy
crockett
i
felt
it
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
have
one
to
wear
to
meet
my
first
bear
my
first
venture
into
the
woods
below
the
parson
ranch
i
remember
vividly
because
i
was
filled
with
eager
yet
fearful
anticipation
i
expected
to
meet
a
grizzly
around
every
bowlder
i
kept
wondering
how
fast
a
bear
could
run
i
halted
frequently
beside
trees
for
i
remembered
my
father
saying
grizzlies
did
not
climb
so
i
planned
to
shin
up
the
tallest
tree
in
the
woods
should
one
come
in
sight
in
my
dreams
back
on
the
farm
my
only
fear
had
been
lest
all
the
grizzlies
be
killed
before
i
reached
the
rockies
barring
such
dire
calamity
i
had
never
had
a
doubt
of
my
prowess
but
somehow
when
at
last
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
dark
forest
it
seemed
the
better
part
of
valor
to
postpone
the
actual
encounters
until
i
should
become
more
skillful
with
my
old
rifle
so
obsessed
was
i
by
the
thought
of
bears
that
on
my
first
excursions
into
the
wilds
a
rock
never
rolled
down
a
slope
nor
dropped
from
a
cliff
a
crash
sounded
in
a
thicket
but
that
i
was
sure
a
bear
was
mysteriously
responsible
i
dreamed
of
them
day
and
night
until
they
became
bugbears
grizzly
bugbears
considering
my
intentions
my
first
camp
alone
in
the
wild
basin
country
was
not
entirely
unfortunate
for
there
that
first
exciting
afternoon
i
met
a
bear
face
to
face
of
course
i
gave
him
the
right
of
way
was
i
not
the
intruder
and
he
the
rightful
resident
though
years
have
elapsed
since
i
dropped
my
rifle
and
sped
in
instant
flight
down
the
mountain
side
toward
camp
i
still
like
to
think
that
my
marvelous
speed
discouraged
ursus
horribilis
and
therefore
he
turned
tail
during
my
first
summer
in
the
mountains
i
saw
bears
several
times
in
each
instance
going
about
their
business
and
making
no
move
to
attack
me
after
these
glimpses
of
them
i
gathered
courage
and
decided
to
postpone
my
career
as
a
hunter
no
longer
bears
were
the
objectives
of
my
hunting
expeditions
but
they
always
succeeded
in
eluding
me
many
times
in
stalking
them
i
came
upon
fresh
tracks
showing
they
had
broken
into
flight
at
my
approach
one
day
i
turned
homeward
and
learned
later
i
had
been
within
gunshot
of
one
without
catching
sight
of
him
gradually
my
respect
for
them
grew
the
one
i
had
watched
stalk
the
marmot
increased
my
admiration
of
their
cunning
i
eventually
learned
that
they
are
extremely
alert
and
agile
despite
their
seemingly
stupid
lumbering
about
that
they
employ
keen
eyes
and
sensitive
ears
and
noses
to
the
best
advantage
as
my
respect
for
them
grew
my
ambition
to
become
a
mighty
hunter
of
them
gave
way
to
a
desire
to
learn
more
about
them
to
observe
them
in
their
natural
state
and
study
their
habits
just
as
they
had
inspired
the
most
heroic
dreams
of
my
childhood
so
they
came
to
interest
me
more
than
any
other
animal
of
the
wilds
to
the
south
of
the
parson
ranch
lay
a
wild
rugged
region
which
i
called
the
bad
lands
on
account
of
its
jungle
of
woods
streams
swamps
and
terminal
moraines
where
bowlders
of
all
sizes
had
been
deposited
by
an
ancient
glacier
through
this
tangle
it
was
impossible
to
move
without
making
noise
for
a
fire
had
swept
over
it
and
young
trees
had
sprung
up
so
close
together
that
it
was
impossible
to
move
without
crashing
into
them
it
was
while
on
hands
and
knees
in
one
of
these
thickets
of
new
growth
that
i
came
upon
bear
tracks
the
tracks
were
the
largest
i
had
even
seen
so
i
gripped
my
gun
tightly
and
peered
about
warily
the
tracks
pointed
west
so
i
headed
east
crashing
through
the
trees
ponderously
giving
an
occasional
yell
to
help
the
bear
keep
out
of
my
way
i
had
gone
about
a
hundred
yards
and
was
congratulating
myself
on
my
escape
when
to
my
horror
i
discovered
fresh
tracks
paralleling
mine
altering
my
course
i
went
on
shouting
vigorously
but
with
less
confidence
of
scaring
the
bear
out
of
the
region
in
this
extremity
i
recalled
a
bit
of
advice
the
parson
had
given
me
do
ever
let
on
you
afraid
he
cautioned
me
one
day
because
if
you
do
the
animal
may
turn
on
you
with
this
in
mind
i
faced
about
took
up
the
bear
trail
and
with
ready
rifle
followed
it
i
kept
looking
behind
me
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
wind
was
blowing
snow
off
the
high
peaks
above
and
it
made
the
tracks
easily
followed
for
it
kept
them
fresh
they
turned
aside
angled
off
tacked
and
came
back
close
to
their
first
line
around
and
around
i
trailed
a
dozen
times
i
stopped
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
the
rifle
at
my
shoulder
but
my
alarm
was
occasioned
by
some
other
denizen
of
the
wilds
twice
deer
crashed
away
and
left
me
rooted
fast
and
once
a
cock
grouse
took
the
air
from
a
rock
just
above
my
head
and
nearly
precipitated
a
stampede
finally
i
gave
up
the
chase
and
started
home
still
watching
warily
for
the
bear
better
to
guard
against
attack
i
climbed
a
little
ridge
that
overlooked
the
irregular
openings
through
which
i
had
been
trailing
and
up
there
paralleling
my
course
were
bear
tracks
bruin
had
been
craftily
looking
me
over
from
his
higher
position
i
at
once
advised
that
bear
by
every
means
at
my
command
that
he
was
no
longer
being
hunted
and
i
made
tracks
for
home
as
fast
as
my
legs
would
let
me
watching
warily
or
bearily
in
all
directions
the
parson
laughed
heartily
when
i
told
of
my
experience
that
night
as
together
with
aunt
jane
we
sat
before
the
glowing
fire
of
his
hearth
despite
aunt
jane
gentle
excuses
for
me
i
felt
ashamed
and
determined
to
return
next
day
and
take
up
the
bear
trail
running
away
from
an
unseen
bear
was
ludicrous
not
to
say
cowardly
but
i
comforted
myself
with
the
assurance
that
even
the
parson
might
have
no
other
chance
to
run
if
the
bear
saw
him
first
the
bad
lands
became
the
scene
of
many
a
game
with
the
animals
slipping
silently
away
as
i
blundered
along
behind
puzzling
out
their
trails
and
imagining
i
was
stalking
them
unawares
my
many
failures
while
discouraging
were
fruitful
of
experience
for
i
learned
to
hunt
thus
discounting
the
noses
of
the
bears
and
muffling
to
some
extent
my
clumsy
movements
from
the
deer
repeated
trips
into
that
rough
region
informed
me
that
one
or
two
bears
lived
there
and
that
though
they
often
left
it
to
explore
some
other
region
they
eventually
returned
to
their
own
home
range
in
tracing
their
movements
i
kept
a
sort
of
bertillon
record
only
instead
of
taking
as
is
done
with
criminals
i
measured
footprints
sketching
them
in
my
notebook
noting
any
slight
peculiarity
that
would
distinguish
one
track
from
another
and
thus
made
positive
identification
possible
i
was
compelled
to
get
my
information
concerning
the
bears
movements
mostly
from
their
tracks
for
they
were
far
too
crafty
to
be
seen
in
person
they
evidently
moved
on
the
assumption
that
vigilance
was
the
price
of
life
they
used
their
wits
as
well
as
their
keen
senses
seemed
to
reason
as
well
as
to
have
instinct
moreover
they
made
use
of
other
animals
for
their
own
defense
they
were
ever
alertly
watching
the
significant
movements
of
their
neighbors
for
signals
of
dangers
beyond
the
range
of
their
own
senses
the
quiet
retreat
of
a
fox
or
coyote
apprised
them
of
something
unusual
in
the
wind
the
sudden
of
magpies
and
jays
warned
them
of
the
approach
of
an
enemy
they
distinguished
between
the
casual
flight
of
birds
and
their
flying
when
bound
toward
a
kill
of
mountain
lion
or
other
beasts
of
prey
they
were
on
every
animal
broadcasting
station
on
their
range
i
learned
that
contrary
to
the
lurid
tales
of
the
early
explorers
and
hunters
they
were
deeming
it
no
disgrace
to
run
away
from
danger
and
leaving
the
vicinity
as
soon
as
man
appeared
in
it
true
their
curiosity
sometimes
tempted
them
to
circle
back
and
watch
a
man
from
some
secure
retreat
and
at
such
times
they
slipped
as
silently
from
one
thicket
to
another
as
a
fox
sampling
the
air
for
odors
standing
erect
to
watch
and
listen
bit
by
bit
as
i
learned
more
about
them
i
came
to
revise
my
early
gory
opinion
of
them
my
impression
had
been
formed
chiefly
from
tales
of
lewis
and
clark
expedition
when
they
made
their
memorable
trip
across
the
continent
grizzlies
were
not
afraid
of
men
because
the
arrows
of
the
indians
were
ineffective
against
them
whenever
food
attracted
them
to
an
indian
camp
they
moseyed
fearlessly
among
the
tepees
helping
themselves
to
it
and
scattering
the
redskins
their
attempts
thus
to
raid
white
men
camps
gave
rise
to
stories
of
their
savagery
and
their
fearless
deadly
attacks
on
men
these
tales
while
pure
fiction
led
to
the
belief
that
all
bears
were
bad
and
should
be
killed
at
every
opportunity
and
ever
since
lewis
and
clark
saw
the
first
one
men
with
dogs
and
guns
traps
and
poison
have
been
on
their
trail
while
i
do
not
believe
bears
guilty
of
the
many
offenses
charged
them
i
am
sure
that
they
had
been
the
life
of
the
party
at
many
a
camp
having
been
led
out
of
their
retirement
by
their
curiosity
in
the
region
where
first
i
followed
a
bear
or
where
it
followed
me
there
ranged
two
of
these
animals
each
recording
a
different
track
and
displaying
individual
traits
which
i
came
to
recognize
the
smaller
track
had
short
claws
that
left
their
prints
in
the
sand
or
soft
places
in
following
this
track
i
found
that
the
maker
was
inclined
to
be
indolent
that
if
the
digging
after
a
chipmunk
was
hard
he
left
the
job
unfinished
and
sought
easier
sources
of
food
thus
the
black
bear
that
frequented
the
bad
lands
loafed
across
his
range
living
by
the
easiest
means
possible
and
rarely
exerting
himself
twice
when
blackie
trail
crossed
that
of
other
black
bears
the
tracks
showed
that
all
stopped
to
play
romping
much
as
children
romp
and
showing
a
sociable
disposition
it
was
usually
late
in
november
before
the
black
bear
denned
up
for
the
winter
commonly
adapting
the
shelter
beneath
some
windfall
to
make
a
winter
home
by
enlarging
and
improving
it
and
perhaps
by
raking
in
some
dead
pine
needles
at
the
approach
of
fall
blackie
left
off
distant
wanderings
conserved
energy
by
little
exertion
and
thus
waxed
fat
in
the
thickest
of
the
rough
jumble
i
found
two
of
his
deserted
winter
dens
to
which
he
never
returned
and
once
in
midwinter
i
found
him
out
asleep
beneath
some
brush
over
which
the
snow
had
drifted
it
was
the
thread
of
rising
steam
from
a
tiny
hole
above
the
den
that
first
attracted
my
attention
to
it
but
my
nose
gave
me
additional
information
blackie
tracks
showed
he
had
unusually
large
feet
for
his
pounds
so
i
called
him
bigfoot
there
was
a
marked
difference
between
blackie
and
the
other
tracks
i
found
in
the
the
other
tracks
were
those
of
a
grizzly
a
fact
i
determined
after
collecting
evidence
for
several
years
and
by
sight
of
the
animals
themselves
there
was
a
wide
difference
too
in
the
actions
of
these
animals
whenever
anything
unusual
happened
blackie
commonly
ran
away
without
waiting
to
learn
what
had
caused
the
alarm
the
grizzly
displayed
extreme
caution
usually
standing
erect
on
his
hind
feet
remaining
motionless
watching
for
silent
signals
of
other
animals
and
the
birds
swinging
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
training
his
nose
in
all
directions
cocking
his
ears
alertly
as
a
coyote
when
he
located
the
enemy
he
slipped
away
noiselessly
followed
a
trail
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
left
the
vicinity
perhaps
traveling
ten
or
twenty
miles
before
stopping
unlike
blackie
too
the
grizzly
was
a
prodigious
worker
no
job
was
too
big
for
him
often
he
spent
an
hour
or
more
in
digging
out
a
tiny
titbit
such
as
a
chipmunk
and
several
times
in
his
pursuit
of
a
marmot
he
excavated
in
rockslides
holes
large
enough
for
small
basements
daily
he
traveled
many
miles
foraging
for
food
as
he
moved
sometimes
eating
swarms
of
grasshoppers
or
stowing
away
bushels
of
grass
or
other
greenery
or
uprooting
the
ground
for
dogtooth
violets
of
which
he
was
very
fond
such
spots
when
he
had
finished
his
rooting
resembled
a
field
which
the
hogs
had
plowed
up
in
one
respect
the
black
bear
and
the
grizzly
were
alike
they
never
seemed
to
have
enough
to
eat
but
had
the
insatiable
appetites
of
growing
boys
never
showing
any
signs
of
being
finicky
but
devouring
everything
edible
ants
hoppers
chipmunks
marmots
and
rabbits
comprised
their
fresh
meat
while
roots
shoots
bulbs
grass
berries
and
practically
everything
growing
served
for
vegetables
they
both
were
inordinately
fond
of
honey
early
one
fall
the
grizzly
left
his
home
range
and
headed
for
the
foothills
more
than
twenty
miles
away
he
found
a
bee
tree
an
old
hollow
cedar
which
he
tore
open
he
devoured
both
bees
and
honey
then
went
lumbering
home
mountain
lions
made
frequent
kills
about
the
region
leaving
the
carcasses
of
deer
cattle
horses
and
burros
which
the
bears
located
with
their
noses
or
by
the
flight
of
birds
and
gorged
themselves
afterward
lying
down
in
some
retreat
and
sleeping
long
peaceful
hours
it
was
because
of
their
scavenger
habits
that
they
came
to
be
blamed
for
killing
the
animals
upon
which
they
fed
but
not
once
did
i
find
evidence
that
they
had
killed
anything
larger
than
a
marmot
the
grizzly
was
always
working
industriously
from
dawn
to
dark
or
at
night
while
blackie
dallied
even
though
making
a
bear
living
he
preferred
to
go
empty
rather
than
to
work
for
food
three
winters
in
succession
the
grizzly
climbed
to
a
den
in
an
exposed
spot
on
the
northern
slope
of
mount
meeker
it
was
a
low
opening
beneath
a
rock
the
entrance
to
which
was
partially
stopped
with
loose
rubble
raked
from
inside
the
cave
and
every
fall
he
renovated
it
by
chinking
the
larger
cracks
and
by
pawing
together
loose
bits
of
rock
for
a
bed
as
fall
approached
his
tracks
led
to
it
apparently
he
napped
inside
occasionally
to
try
it
out
his
ultimate
retirement
for
winter
hibernation
depended
upon
the
weather
and
the
food
supply
if
the
fall
were
late
with
plenty
of
food
he
would
still
be
about
the
woods
as
late
as
december
while
one
fall
when
snow
came
early
and
deep
and
so
made
food
unavailable
he
disappeared
at
the
end
of
october
the
grizzly
had
many
individual
traits
not
once
in
the
years
i
followed
him
did
he
show
any
desire
for
others
of
his
kind
he
preferred
being
alone
his
play
consisted
chiefly
of
elaborate
stalkings
of
easily
captured
animals
if
his
hunger
was
appeased
for
a
time
he
would
turn
to
hunting
grasshoppers
marking
the
spot
where
one
had
alighted
he
would
steal
forward
and
pounce
upon
it
as
though
it
were
an
animal
of
size
and
fighting
ability
again
he
would
take
great
pains
to
waylay
a
chipmunk
lying
motionless
while
the
unwary
little
spermophile
ventured
closer
and
closer
then
with
a
slap
of
a
huge
paw
he
would
reduce
his
victim
to
the
general
shape
and
thinness
of
a
pancake
though
the
grizzly
was
somewhat
awkward
in
appearance
he
could
move
with
amazing
speed
and
his
strength
was
incredible
from
glimpses
i
had
of
him
i
estimated
his
weight
at
six
hundred
pounds
but
he
could
move
the
carcass
of
a
cow
or
horse
twice
that
heavy
once
on
cabin
creek
not
many
miles
from
his
accustomed
haunts
a
lion
killed
a
horse
as
he
approached
the
kill
the
grizzly
circled
warily
around
it
stood
erect
to
sniff
and
listen
and
growled
warningly
informing
all
intruders
that
it
was
his
when
he
had
eaten
his
fill
he
dragged
the
carcass
nearly
a
hundred
yards
uphill
over
fallen
timber
into
a
thicket
where
he
covered
it
against
the
prying
eyes
of
birds
thinking
i
presume
that
they
would
signal
other
animals
of
its
location
the
date
of
his
emergence
from
his
den
in
the
spring
like
his
holing
up
in
the
fall
depended
upon
the
weather
commonly
though
he
hibernated
about
of
the
year
when
he
came
out
after
his
long
sleep
he
was
very
thin
the
great
layers
of
fat
he
had
taken
care
to
put
on
before
denning
up
were
gone
one
year
i
followed
his
tracks
the
day
he
came
out
to
learn
what
he
first
ate
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
scarcely
ate
at
all
instead
of
being
ravenous
as
i
had
supposed
he
would
be
he
seemed
to
have
no
appetite
and
barely
tasted
a
green
shoot
or
two
and
a
little
grass
his
claws
had
grown
out
over
winter
and
the
tough
soles
of
his
feet
soon
shed
off
so
that
though
born
to
the
wilds
he
became
a
tenderfoot
upon
two
occasions
i
found
the
tracks
of
this
bad
lands
grizzly
far
from
home
once
he
was
at
the
edge
of
a
snowbank
near
arapahoe
glacier
where
he
had
gone
for
a
frozen
grasshopper
feast
and
another
time
some
years
later
beyond
ypsilon
mountain
in
an
old
sheep
trail
that
led
toward
the
headwaters
of
the
poudre
river
he
was
more
than
thirty
miles
from
home
and
still
going
experience
with
men
has
made
the
few
surviving
grizzlies
of
the
rockies
crafty
and
they
are
instinctively
wary
their
habits
have
been
much
the
same
wherever
i
have
had
opportunity
of
observing
them
their
extreme
caution
would
perhaps
lead
one
to
believe
them
cowards
but
nothing
is
farther
from
the
truth
for
they
are
fighters
of
first
rank
and
show
unrivaled
courage
as
well
as
speed
and
prodigious
strength
in
combat
a
fighting
grizzly
is
a
deadly
antagonist
never
giving
up
determined
to
win
or
die
when
a
grizzly
turns
killer
as
occasionally
one
of
them
does
you
may
depend
upon
it
there
are
extenuating
circumstances
and
any
jury
would
exonerate
him
of
blame
when
his
home
range
becomes
settled
up
and
the
sources
of
his
natural
food
are
destroyed
he
is
forced
to
seek
new
haunts
and
to
eat
such
food
as
his
new
location
affords
it
is
not
strange
that
constricted
in
his
range
by
ranchers
and
cattlemen
with
no
opportunity
to
seek
food
according
to
his
instinctive
habits
he
sometimes
turns
cattle
killer
his
action
brands
him
at
once
as
a
bad
bear
a
killer
and
his
infamy
quickly
spreads
the
length
of
the
mountains
he
is
blamed
for
the
kills
of
mountain
lions
and
the
death
of
stock
killed
by
chance
he
is
hunted
becomes
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
is
kept
so
continuously
on
the
move
that
he
has
to
prey
on
cattle
because
he
is
not
given
time
to
forage
in
his
former
manner
persecution
sharpens
his
faculties
he
eludes
his
pursuers
and
their
dogs
poisoned
bait
and
traps
with
a
shrewdness
that
puts
their
intelligence
to
shame
it
was
my
rare
privilege
one
day
to
witness
the
chase
of
an
accused
killer
by
a
dog
pack
i
was
near
timberline
in
the
rabbit
ear
mountains
when
first
i
heard
their
distant
baying
and
caught
sight
of
them
far
down
a
narrow
valley
mere
moving
specks
close
behind
these
small
dots
were
larger
ones
men
on
horseback
a
mile
ahead
of
the
pack
a
lone
object
galloped
into
an
opening
and
as
i
focused
my
glasses
stood
erect
listening
it
was
a
grizzly
he
paused
but
a
moment
then
tacked
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
crossed
the
ridge
dropped
into
a
parallel
valley
and
doubled
back
the
way
he
had
come
occasionally
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
ambled
along
seemingly
without
haste
yet
covering
the
ground
at
surprising
speed
abruptly
he
left
this
second
valley
and
recrossed
the
ridge
to
the
first
taking
up
the
trail
he
had
been
on
when
the
pack
disturbed
him
the
riders
were
still
upon
the
ridge
when
the
dogs
recrossed
it
and
started
baying
up
the
first
valley
when
the
fresh
scent
led
them
back
over
the
grizzly
first
trail
they
hesitated
confused
disagreeing
among
themselves
as
to
the
course
to
follow
and
while
the
dogs
delayed
the
bear
abandoned
the
lower
ridges
and
timbered
valleys
and
headed
toward
the
cliffs
here
the
going
was
slow
sometimes
he
followed
old
game
trails
but
more
often
he
chose
his
own
way
he
climbed
up
the
face
of
a
cliff
following
narrow
ledges
at
the
top
he
turned
and
angled
back
arriving
at
the
base
of
the
wall
again
but
some
distance
from
the
place
where
he
had
climbed
up
and
where
he
crossed
his
own
trail
he
swung
back
and
forth
repeatedly
half
an
hour
later
the
pack
came
howling
to
the
cliff
and
began
seeking
a
way
up
they
scattered
swung
back
and
forth
along
the
ledges
crossed
and
recrossed
the
grizzly
tracks
but
seemed
unable
to
follow
the
way
he
had
gone
before
they
finally
circled
the
cliff
and
picked
up
his
trail
again
the
bear
ruse
had
succeeded
by
it
he
gained
several
minutes
lead
on
his
pursuers
the
grizzly
emerged
above
timberline
near
where
i
sat
and
galloped
straight
for
a
pass
that
overlooked
the
deep
cañons
dark
forests
and
rocky
ridges
on
the
other
side
of
the
range
just
before
he
gained
it
three
of
the
dogs
broke
cover
and
gave
tongue
wildly
excited
at
the
sight
of
their
quarry
and
instantly
hot
on
his
trail
the
bear
coolly
kept
his
same
gait
until
just
short
of
the
pass
at
the
top
of
a
steep
smooth
incline
between
two
huge
rock
slabs
he
halted
and
faced
about
waiting
for
them
to
come
up
when
the
dogs
panting
and
spent
from
running
dashed
up
he
had
got
his
wind
and
was
ready
for
them
the
three
dogs
rushed
up
the
steep
rock
with
a
deafening
roar
the
grizzly
struck
out
right
and
left
two
of
the
dogs
ceased
howling
and
lay
where
they
fell
the
third
turned
tail
and
fled
the
bear
stepping
over
the
dead
bodies
of
his
vanquished
foes
leisurely
proceeded
through
the
pass
and
down
into
the
wild
country
beyond
i
have
watched
other
grizzlies
under
similar
conditions
and
they
have
all
shown
the
same
shrewd
cool
craftiness
they
appear
to
reason
to
plan
their
actions
indicate
forethought
premeditation
they
seem
to
have
not
only
the
marvelous
instinct
of
the
animal
world
but
also
an
almost
human
power
to
think
they
conserve
their
energy
bide
their
time
choose
their
position
and
in
short
set
the
stage
to
their
own
advantage
they
have
an
instinct
for
the
psychological
moment
it
seems
at
times
that
they
evolve
it
out
of
the
chaos
of
chance
the
parson
said
you
never
can
tell
what
a
bear
will
do
and
i
for
one
believe
him
the
oddest
performance
of
an
individual
bear
i
ever
saw
took
place
over
on
the
banks
of
the
poudre
river
rambling
through
the
forest
i
came
late
one
evening
upon
the
camp
of
two
trappers
they
were
making
a
business
of
trapping
and
had
extensive
set
throughout
the
region
mostly
for
beavers
minks
bobcats
and
coyotes
but
some
for
bears
too
in
a
narrow
dry
gulch
one
of
them
had
found
fresh
bear
tracks
he
thought
of
a
black
bear
leading
up
to
the
scattered
bleached
bones
of
a
cow
tracks
about
the
skull
indicated
that
the
bear
had
rolled
it
about
much
as
a
puppy
worries
a
bone
one
day
the
trapper
found
the
skull
hidden
in
some
juniper
bushes
and
reasoned
that
the
bear
returned
from
day
to
day
played
with
it
then
hid
it
away
so
he
returned
to
camp
got
a
trap
and
set
it
by
the
beast
toy
i
was
eager
to
learn
the
outcome
of
this
action
so
i
gratefully
accepted
the
trappers
invitation
to
stay
over
with
them
next
day
i
went
along
when
they
visited
the
trap
to
our
astonishment
the
skull
was
gone
and
the
trap
still
set
it
was
easy
to
trace
the
culprit
for
his
tracks
revealed
that
his
left
front
foot
was
badly
twisted
its
track
pointing
in
almost
at
right
angles
to
the
tracks
of
the
other
three
feet
with
the
clawmarks
almost
touching
the
track
of
the
right
front
foot
we
followed
his
trail
till
we
came
to
a
sandy
stretch
upon
which
that
bear
had
held
high
carnival
he
had
rolled
the
skull
about
punted
it
with
his
good
right
paw
and
leaped
upon
it
in
mimic
attack
as
though
it
were
a
fat
marmot
then
playtime
over
he
had
carried
it
a
considerable
distance
and
cached
it
beneath
some
logs
the
trapper
returned
to
camp
for
another
trap
and
set
it
and
the
first
near
the
skull
concealing
the
traps
cleverly
in
depressions
scooped
out
in
the
sand
and
covering
their
gaping
toothed
jaws
with
loose
pine
needles
then
he
scattered
a
few
pine
cones
about
and
placed
dead
tree
limbs
near
the
traps
in
such
a
way
that
in
stepping
over
them
the
bear
would
be
liable
to
step
squarely
upon
the
concealed
pan
of
one
of
them
three
times
the
bear
rescued
the
precious
cow
skull
each
time
avoiding
the
traps
at
last
in
desperation
the
trapper
took
two
more
traps
to
the
gulch
and
vowed
that
he
pull
up
stakes
and
leave
the
bear
alone
if
he
did
not
get
him
with
the
set
he
purposed
making
with
boyish
interest
i
accompanied
him
to
the
gulch
carrying
one
of
the
traps
for
him
we
left
the
traps
a
short
distance
from
where
the
bear
had
concealed
the
old
skull
while
the
trapper
looked
the
ground
over
and
decided
to
set
the
traps
where
the
skull
was
hidden
for
the
spot
was
ideal
for
the
purpose
on
two
sides
logs
formed
a
barrier
and
beyond
them
was
a
huge
bowlder
the
two
forming
a
natural
little
cove
he
expected
the
bear
to
approach
his
plaything
from
the
unobstructed
side
the
trapper
had
further
plans
close
beside
the
logs
grew
a
stunted
pine
tree
with
limbs
near
the
ground
in
its
crotch
he
placed
the
cow
skull
higher
than
the
bear
could
reach
and
fastened
it
there
with
wire
then
after
setting
the
traps
in
a
around
the
tree
just
below
the
skull
and
concealing
them
carefully
we
returned
to
camp
jubilantly
confident
of
catching
bruin
three
times
we
visited
the
set
and
found
things
undisturbed
we
decided
the
bear
had
forsworn
his
toy
and
run
away
however
i
lingered
at
the
camp
in
hope
that
the
matter
would
yet
come
to
a
decisive
end
some
days
later
when
we
visited
the
gulch
again
we
came
upon
a
surprise
from
a
distance
we
missed
the
skull
from
the
tree
so
we
hastened
forward
keeping
a
sharp
eye
out
for
the
bear
which
we
felt
certain
was
in
a
trap
and
lying
low
at
the
set
we
stopped
short
the
two
traps
nearest
the
open
space
had
been
carefully
dug
up
and
turned
over
and
lay
butter
side
down
the
bear
had
climbed
into
the
tree
wrenched
his
plaything
free
and
dropped
it
to
the
ground
tracks
in
the
sand
showed
that
after
climbing
down
he
had
cautiously
placed
his
feet
in
the
same
tracks
he
had
made
when
he
advanced
toward
the
tree
he
had
carried
the
skull
a
hundred
yards
from
the
traps
and
hidden
it
again
but
there
were
no
signs
that
he
had
stopped
to
play
with
it
the
trapper
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
after
recovering
from
his
astonishment
he
sprung
the
traps
and
we
carried
them
back
to
camp
some
smart
that
ole
bear
the
trapper
told
his
partner
he
smart
enough
to
live
a
hundred
years
an
i
willin
to
let
him
no
campfire
is
complete
without
bear
stories
and
it
was
around
one
that
i
heard
the
funniest
bear
story
imaginable
a
lone
trapper
was
caught
one
day
in
a
trap
of
his
own
making
a
ponderous
wooden
coop
calculated
to
catch
the
bear
alive
by
dropping
a
heavy
log
door
in
place
at
the
open
end
this
door
was
on
a
trigger
which
a
bear
in
attempting
to
steal
the
bait
would
spring
as
this
tale
was
told
the
trapper
had
just
completed
his
trap
and
was
adjusting
the
trigger
when
the
heavy
door
crashed
down
pinning
him
across
the
threshold
with
his
legs
outside
the
door
caught
on
a
section
of
log
in
the
doorway
and
saved
him
from
broken
legs
but
he
was
a
helpless
prisoner
in
struggling
to
free
himself
he
kicked
over
a
can
of
honey
he
had
brought
along
for
bait
and
the
sticky
fluid
oozed
over
his
thrashing
legs
four
hours
he
lay
imprisoned
shouting
at
intervals
with
the
hope
that
some
wandering
prospector
or
trapper
might
hear
him
instead
a
bear
came
his
way
tempted
by
the
scent
of
the
honey
the
bear
loitered
near
by
some
time
no
doubt
wary
of
the
presence
of
man
but
at
last
his
appetite
overcame
his
caution
and
he
started
licking
up
the
honey
almost
frantic
with
fear
dreading
the
gash
of
tearing
teeth
the
man
lay
quiet
while
the
animal
licked
the
smears
off
his
trembling
legs
fortunately
for
the
trapper
the
bear
was
not
out
for
meat
that
day
so
after
cleaning
up
the
sweet
he
went
his
way
the
relieved
and
unharmed
man
was
rescued
shortly
afterward
the
only
serious
injury
i
have
suffered
from
a
wild
animal
was
inflicted
inside
the
city
limits
of
denver
colorado
largest
city
and
capital
the
beginning
of
this
story
dated
back
to
the
time
when
i
discovered
that
another
grizzly
had
intruded
into
the
bad
lands
of
my
bears
the
first
announcement
of
the
strange
bear
arrival
was
its
tracks
together
with
those
of
two
tiny
cubs
this
was
in
may
while
yet
the
snowbanks
lingered
in
that
high
country
across
the
miles
of
fallen
timber
i
lugged
a
steel
bear
trap
and
set
it
in
a
likely
spot
beside
the
frozen
carcass
of
a
deer
afterwards
i
inspected
it
every
day
though
to
do
so
i
had
to
cross
boggy
rough
country
fretted
over
with
fallen
logs
i
always
found
plenty
of
bear
tracks
it
was
typical
bear
country
and
there
were
many
signs
of
their
activities
old
logs
torn
apart
ant
hills
disturbed
and
lush
grass
trampled
the
first
week
in
june
i
made
a
surprising
catch
three
grizzly
bears
and
a
fox
a
mother
grizzly
had
stepped
into
my
trap
and
her
two
cubs
of
about
fifteen
pounds
each
had
lingered
near
by
until
growing
hungry
they
had
ventured
to
their
mother
and
one
had
been
caught
in
a
coyote
trap
set
to
protect
the
bait
the
fox
had
been
caught
before
the
bear
arrival
grizzly
frantic
over
her
predicament
had
demolished
everything
within
her
reach
tearing
the
red
fox
from
its
trap
literally
shredding
it
apparently
feeling
it
was
to
blame
for
her
misfortune
her
struggles
soon
exhausted
her
for
it
was
a
warm
day
and
when
i
discovered
her
she
was
about
spent
and
easily
dispatched
the
cubs
very
small
helpless
and
forlorn
howled
lustily
for
their
mother
i
decided
to
tie
their
feet
together
and
their
mouths
shut
with
ready
cord
i
dived
headlong
upon
a
cub
caught
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
lifted
him
triumphantly
then
dropped
him
unceremoniously
the
end
of
a
finger
badly
bitten
i
was
compelled
to
return
to
my
cabin
for
a
sack
because
the
amount
of
tying
required
to
render
the
cubs
really
harmless
seemed
likely
to
choke
them
to
death
before
i
got
them
home
it
required
about
an
hour
lively
tussle
to
get
the
two
young
grizzlies
stowed
safely
in
the
sack
but
i
learned
that
having
them
sacked
was
no
guarantee
of
getting
them
home
if
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
a
bear
at
home
chained
up
is
worth
the
whole
rockies
full
in
the
woods
the
old
grizzly
hide
paws
included
must
have
weighed
fifty
pounds
the
cubs
sacked
thirty
a
total
load
of
pounds
to
carry
out
over
rocks
and
fallen
trees
through
bog
and
willows
with
this
load
on
my
back
i
struggled
to
my
feet
and
started
picking
my
way
slowly
circling
logs
and
avoiding
soft
spots
the
first
half
mile
was
the
best
after
that
things
thickened
up
the
bog
deepened
the
bears
wanted
to
get
out
and
walk
where
the
stream
emerges
from
between
a
wide
moraine
and
meeker
mountain
it
is
not
broad
nor
very
deep
but
it
is
exceedingly
cold
and
swift
and
the
only
crossing
was
a
aspen
which
lay
toward
me
presenting
an
array
of
limbs
that
served
as
banisters
about
midway
over
the
limbs
gave
out
leaving
the
smooth
aspen
trunk
as
a
many
times
i
had
crossed
this
without
mishap
so
i
had
no
qualms
about
tackling
it
now
deliberately
i
edged
along
stepping
slowly
carefully
progressing
nicely
until
about
midway
just
then
one
of
the
cubs
sank
his
teeth
into
my
back
i
jerked
away
twisted
tottered
half
regained
my
balance
then
pitched
headlong
into
the
icy
water
of
the
beaver
pond
beneath
for
a
moment
there
was
a
grand
mêlée
the
cubs
did
not
like
the
ice
water
any
more
than
i
they
squirmed
and
clawed
fought
free
of
the
sack
and
lightened
my
load
considerably
i
spent
a
busy
hour
catching
and
sacking
them
again
it
required
six
hours
to
transport
those
cubs
four
miles
and
i
sure
they
were
as
thankful
as
their
ferry
when
the
trip
ended
at
my
cabin
from
the
first
week
in
june
until
the
middle
of
december
they
grew
from
fifteen
pounds
to
forty
each
although
they
were
interesting
pets
their
keep
became
a
problem
such
appetites
they
could
never
get
enough
they
were
finicky
about
the
quality
of
their
food
but
oh
the
quantity
then
too
i
could
leave
them
and
go
on
long
trips
so
i
decided
to
part
with
them
the
city
of
denver
sent
a
representative
to
see
me
for
they
wanted
some
grizzlies
to
show
eastern
tourists
it
was
with
the
feeling
that
i
was
betraying
the
cubs
however
that
i
finally
took
them
to
denver
they
were
so
obedient
and
that
i
hesitated
to
deliver
them
into
unknown
hands
they
knew
their
names
johnny
and
jenny
as
well
as
children
knew
theirs
at
command
they
would
stand
erect
walk
about
on
their
hind
feet
whining
eagerly
for
some
treat
looking
for
all
the
world
like
funny
little
old
men
at
the
denver
city
zoo
we
were
welcomed
by
the
keeper
hill
who
courteously
invited
me
to
spend
the
day
with
him
and
entertained
me
by
taking
me
into
many
of
the
cages
permitting
me
to
feed
some
of
the
animals
and
telling
me
interesting
tales
of
happenings
at
the
zoo
when
we
returned
to
the
large
inclosure
surrounding
the
cage
of
the
larger
and
fiercer
animals
hill
asked
me
to
assist
in
transfering
a
brown
bear
and
a
black
bear
to
the
cage
where
my
pets
were
to
be
housed
these
other
bears
were
over
a
year
old
and
more
than
double
the
size
of
johnny
and
jenny
the
brown
bear
went
willingly
enough
into
the
new
cage
and
we
expected
the
black
bear
to
follow
but
when
he
reached
the
cage
door
he
stopped
gently
we
urged
him
forward
but
his
mind
was
made
up
he
had
gone
as
far
as
he
intended
and
was
homesick
for
his
old
cage
the
keeper
was
tactful
and
unobtrusively
tried
to
maneuver
the
bear
into
the
cage
without
exciting
his
obstinacy
further
but
he
would
yield
at
last
it
came
to
a
show
down
we
had
the
option
of
forcing
the
bear
into
the
cage
or
letting
him
go
back
you
go
inside
and
snub
the
rope
around
the
bars
the
keeper
directed
me
i
boost
from
behind
we
show
him
a
trick
or
two
a
crowd
had
collected
outside
the
heavy
iron
fence
suggestions
were
abundant
no
young
man
ever
had
so
much
advice
in
so
short
a
time
however
we
were
too
busily
engaged
to
profit
by
what
we
were
told
the
keeper
boosted
the
bear
and
i
took
up
the
slack
in
the
rope
but
still
the
bear
balked
though
three
times
we
against
him
then
suddenly
he
let
go
all
holds
and
lunged
through
the
doorway
charging
headlong
upon
me
and
sank
his
teeth
into
my
left
knee
the
bite
and
the
force
of
his
unexpected
charge
knocked
me
backward
into
the
corner
instantly
the
bear
was
on
top
of
me
growling
biting
and
striking
with
my
uninjured
leg
i
kicked
out
savagely
and
thrust
him
away
sliding
him
back
across
the
slippery
concrete
again
he
charged
and
once
more
i
kicked
him
off
outside
the
iron
fence
women
were
screaming
and
men
trying
futilely
to
enter
but
the
fence
was
ten
feet
high
and
the
sharp
iron
points
of
its
pickets
were
discouraging
and
the
gateway
was
locked
against
intruders
at
this
juncture
the
keeper
rushed
to
another
cage
where
he
kept
an
iron
bar
for
just
such
emergencies
but
the
bar
was
away
from
home
that
day
at
this
crisis
johnny
and
jenny
arrived
jenny
collided
with
the
bars
of
the
cage
and
staggered
back
dazed
but
johnny
found
the
open
cage
door
and
charged
the
black
bear
ferociously
the
black
bear
outweighed
my
little
grizzly
three
to
one
but
johnny
struck
his
sensitive
snout
forcing
him
into
a
corner
and
followed
up
striking
with
both
paws
lunging
in
and
taking
furry
samples
of
his
hide
within
a
few
seconds
the
black
bear
was
climbing
the
side
of
the
cage
and
howling
for
help
he
gained
the
shelf
near
the
roof
johnny
unable
to
climb
sat
below
growling
maledictions
in
bear
language
daring
him
to
come
down
and
fight
it
out
but
the
black
bear
had
had
more
than
enough
he
stuck
to
the
safety
seat
whimpering
with
pain
and
fright
thus
limping
and
reluctant
i
took
leave
of
my
pets
the
ambulance
had
arrived
to
rush
me
to
the
hospital
where
my
knee
was
to
be
treated
as
long
as
i
could
see
them
they
looked
after
me
wondering
at
my
desertion
chapter
fifteen
rocky
mountain
national
park
it
had
been
my
boyhood
dream
to
find
a
region
unspoiled
by
man
wild
primitive
when
i
saw
that
rugged
wilderness
called
the
rockies
i
was
sure
i
had
found
it
miles
and
miles
of
virgin
forest
innocent
of
ax
and
saw
miles
and
miles
of
fertile
valleys
yet
to
feel
the
touch
of
plow
miles
and
miles
of
unclaimed
homesteads
with
never
the
smoke
of
a
settler
chimney
deer
and
elk
sheep
and
bear
roamed
the
forests
beavers
preëmpted
the
valleys
trout
spashed
and
rippled
the
waters
of
the
lakes
and
rivers
yes
this
was
purely
primeval
natural
uncivilized
but
the
did
not
agree
with
me
parson
lamb
whose
nearest
neighbor
was
ten
miles
away
complained
that
the
country
was
being
spoiled
it
gotten
so
nowadays
you
ca
see
a
mountain
craning
your
neck
around
some
fellow
shack
cabins
everywhere
cluttering
up
the
scenery
i
recalled
my
father
chuckling
about
the
pioneers
always
moving
on
as
soon
as
a
country
got
settled
up
surely
the
parson
was
having
his
little
joke
one
day
when
i
was
out
looking
for
and
peg
i
ran
upon
an
old
trapper
huh
he
said
wo
be
long
till
they
wo
be
no
critters
atall
they
ai
enough
now
to
pay
for
game
ai
what
it
useter
be
in
these
parts
i
tell
you
sonny
i
goin
ter
pull
up
stakes
for
a
real
game
country
to
me
lately
from
the
thickly
settled
prairies
of
kansas
practically
destitute
of
game
their
fears
seemed
unfounded
i
thought
they
exaggerated
and
could
not
understand
their
point
of
view
but
i
came
to
understand
i
lived
to
see
even
greater
changes
take
place
in
the
years
i
wandered
through
the
country
that
parson
lamb
had
witnessed
from
the
day
he
hewed
his
way
through
the
forest
that
he
might
get
his
covered
wagon
into
the
valley
to
that
night
when
i
fell
across
his
threshold
after
pushing
my
bicycle
over
bald
mountain
for
even
as
i
rambled
and
camped
a
subtle
change
was
taking
place
so
slowly
that
for
some
time
i
was
unaware
of
it
i
saw
fewer
animals
in
a
day
journey
at
first
when
i
missed
bands
of
deer
or
wild
sheep
or
some
familiar
bear
from
their
usual
haunts
i
assumed
that
they
had
shifted
their
range
to
more
distant
mountains
all
at
once
i
realized
that
for
a
long
time
i
had
not
come
upon
a
single
elk
nor
even
the
tracks
of
one
i
was
startled
i
made
far
excursions
into
the
more
remote
regions
to
verify
my
assumption
that
the
game
had
merely
retreated
from
the
more
settled
parts
from
the
tops
of
lofty
peaks
i
looked
down
upon
countless
valleys
with
the
hope
that
somewhere
surely
i
would
find
them
i
saw
only
a
few
stragglers
the
wilds
were
like
an
empty
house
where
once
had
lived
happy
children
where
there
had
been
music
and
laughter
shouts
and
romping
but
now
remained
only
silence
freighted
with
sadness
a
great
loneliness
surged
over
me
despite
the
grumbling
complaints
of
the
old
settlers
i
had
taken
for
granted
that
the
country
would
always
stay
as
i
had
found
it
that
other
boys
would
have
it
to
explore
and
that
it
would
thrill
them
even
as
it
had
thrilled
me
i
awoke
at
last
to
the
distressing
truth
that
few
of
the
easily
accessible
spots
were
unspoiled
that
forests
were
falling
that
the
game
was
almost
gone
i
set
out
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
it
i
found
others
as
concerned
as
i
not
only
those
in
the
immediate
vicinity
but
men
of
vision
far
removed
from
the
scene
it
seemed
that
similar
conditions
had
arisen
elsewhere
and
that
men
had
evolved
a
remedy
back
in
congress
had
set
aside
the
yellowstone
region
as
a
national
park
guaranteeing
the
preservation
of
its
wonders
for
all
time
not
only
that
but
the
harassed
and
hunted
game
in
the
country
surrounding
it
had
by
some
subtle
instinct
sensed
its
immunity
to
hunters
and
had
fled
to
it
for
sanctuary
grizzly
bears
migrated
to
it
from
long
distances
and
found
refuge
i
recalled
how
scarce
the
beavers
were
when
first
i
searched
the
valleys
for
them
and
how
after
the
state
had
passed
laws
for
their
protection
they
had
multiplied
here
was
the
solution
of
the
problem
protection
and
the
most
permanent
and
effective
protection
could
be
procured
by
getting
the
government
to
preserve
it
as
a
national
park
but
just
as
nearsighted
and
individuals
opposed
and
tried
to
thwart
the
building
of
the
first
transcontinental
railroad
so
there
were
persons
who
could
see
no
reason
for
setting
aside
this
region
as
a
national
park
men
who
had
for
years
cut
government
timber
without
restriction
or
who
had
grazed
livestock
without
hindrance
or
who
still
hoped
to
strike
rich
mineral
deposits
in
the
proposed
area
to
be
reserved
fortunately
the
men
of
vision
prevailed
and
in
congress
created
the
rocky
mountain
national
park
setting
aside
square
miles
of
territory
most
of
it
straddling
the
continental
divide
and
as
wild
and
primitive
as
when
the
utes
first
hunted
in
it
thus
the
peaks
and
the
verdant
valleys
the
cañons
and
the
rushing
rivers
the
glaciers
and
the
primeval
forests
are
preserved
forever
from
exploitation
in
administering
the
national
parks
the
government
takes
into
consideration
that
they
are
the
property
of
the
whole
people
not
just
of
those
residing
in
adjacent
or
near
territory
not
only
does
it
consider
them
as
belonging
to
the
present
generation
but
to
posterity
with
this
in
mind
it
has
formulated
certain
general
principles
of
administration
applicable
to
all
parks
and
has
adopted
special
policies
adapted
to
the
peculiar
needs
of
individual
parks
for
instance
it
has
found
that
in
order
to
protect
the
visitors
and
insure
their
comfort
and
convenience
it
is
necessary
to
have
certain
regulations
of
hotel
management
and
transportation
facilities
it
has
found
it
impossible
to
hold
many
individual
concerns
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
these
regulations
so
it
has
adopted
the
policy
of
granting
concessions
to
one
