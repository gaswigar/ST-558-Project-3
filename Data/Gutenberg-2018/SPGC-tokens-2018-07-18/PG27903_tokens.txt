you
think
cats
have
such
a
jolly
time
said
lord
hugh
not
a
cat
it
was
mabel
who
untied
the
string
and
soothed
his
terrors
he
landed
there
on
his
four
padded
feet
light
as
a
feather
when
jane
went
in
to
put
mabel
light
out
maurice
crept
in
too
her
bow
went
down
suddenly
he
said
and
pointed
far
above
him
and
every
one
else
towered
the
elephant
it
became
a
quite
efficient
motor
quentin
de
ward
it
landed
on
the
point
of
the
chin
of
smithson
major
are
you
he
said
i
adjure
you
by
the
sacred
tau
the
cart
was
drawn
by
an
enormous
creature
more
like
an
elephant
than
anything
else
cried
the
priest
of
the
immortals
close
your
eyes
on
the
lower
terrace
the
royal
nurse
was
walking
up
and
down
with
the
baby
princess
that
all
the
fuss
was
about
instantly
a
flight
of
winged
arrows
crossed
the
garden
would
kiss
you
on
every
one
of
your
thousand
spears
she
said
give
you
what
you
wish
so
we
all
sat
on
chairs
in
the
and
thought
of
nothing
to
say
harder
than
ever
we
scalped
eliza
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
sidney
threw
the
rug
over
her
and
rolled
her
over
and
over
early
next
morning
he
tried
to
catch
fish
with
several
pieces
of
string
knotted
together
and
a
hairpin
a
radiant
vision
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
there
was
a
splash
he
cried
desperately
and
snapped
at
the
worm
i
the
of
maurice
to
have
your
hair
cut
is
not
painful
nor
does
it
hurt
to
have
your
whiskers
trimmed
but
round
wooden
shoes
shaped
like
bowls
are
not
comfortable
wear
however
much
it
may
amuse
the
onlooker
to
see
you
try
to
walk
in
them
if
you
have
a
nice
fur
coat
like
a
company
promoter
it
is
most
annoying
to
be
made
to
swim
in
it
and
if
you
had
a
tail
surely
it
would
be
solely
your
own
affair
that
any
one
should
tie
a
tin
can
to
it
would
strike
you
as
an
unwarrantable
impertinence
to
say
the
least
yet
it
is
difficult
for
an
outsider
to
see
these
things
from
the
point
of
view
of
both
the
persons
concerned
to
maurice
scissors
in
hand
alive
and
earnest
to
snip
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
shorten
the
stiff
whiskers
of
lord
hugh
cecil
by
a
generous
inch
he
did
not
understand
how
useful
those
whiskers
were
to
lord
hugh
both
in
sport
and
in
the
more
serious
business
of
getting
a
living
also
it
amused
maurice
to
throw
lord
hugh
into
ponds
though
lord
hugh
only
once
permitted
this
liberty
to
put
walnuts
on
lord
hugh
feet
and
then
to
watch
him
walk
on
ice
was
in
maurice
opinion
as
good
as
a
play
lord
hugh
was
a
very
favourite
cat
but
maurice
was
discreet
and
lord
hugh
except
under
violent
suffering
was
at
that
time
anyhow
dumb
but
the
empty
attached
to
lord
hugh
tail
and
hind
legs
this
had
a
voice
and
rattling
against
stairs
banisters
and
the
legs
of
stricken
furniture
it
cried
aloud
for
vengeance
lord
hugh
suffering
violently
added
his
voice
and
this
time
the
family
heard
there
was
a
chase
a
chorus
of
pussy
and
then
and
the
tail
and
the
tin
and
lord
hugh
were
caught
under
jane
bed
the
tail
and
the
tin
acquiesced
in
their
rescue
lord
hugh
did
not
he
fought
scratched
and
bit
jane
carried
the
scars
of
that
rescue
for
many
a
long
week
when
all
was
calm
maurice
was
sought
and
after
some
little
natural
delay
found
in
the
maurice
his
mother
almost
sobbed
you
what
will
your
father
say
maurice
thought
he
knew
what
his
father
would
do
you
know
the
mother
went
on
wrong
it
is
to
be
cruel
did
mean
to
be
cruel
maurice
said
and
what
is
more
he
spoke
the
truth
all
the
unwelcome
attentions
he
had
showered
on
lord
hugh
had
not
been
exactly
intended
to
hurt
that
stout
veteran
only
it
was
interesting
to
see
what
a
cat
would
do
if
you
threw
it
in
the
water
or
cut
its
whiskers
or
tied
things
to
its
tail
but
you
must
have
meant
to
be
cruel
said
mother
you
will
have
to
be
punished
wish
i
had
said
maurice
from
the
heart
do
i
said
his
mother
with
a
sigh
it
is
the
first
time
you
know
you
tied
lord
hugh
up
in
a
bag
with
the
hedgehog
only
last
tuesday
week
you
better
go
to
your
room
and
think
it
over
i
shall
have
to
tell
your
father
directly
he
comes
home
maurice
went
to
his
room
and
thought
it
over
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
hated
lord
hugh
why
could
the
beastly
cat
have
held
his
tongue
and
sat
still
that
at
the
time
would
have
been
a
disappointment
but
now
maurice
wished
it
had
happened
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
savagely
kicked
the
edge
of
the
green
kidderminster
carpet
and
hated
the
cat
he
had
meant
to
be
cruel
he
was
sure
he
had
he
would
have
pinched
the
cat
feet
or
squeezed
its
tail
in
the
door
or
pulled
its
whiskers
or
poured
hot
water
on
it
he
felt
himself
and
knew
that
he
would
feel
still
more
so
after
the
inevitable
interview
with
his
father
but
that
interview
did
not
take
the
immediately
painful
form
expected
by
maurice
his
father
did
say
i
will
show
you
what
it
feels
like
to
be
hurt
maurice
had
braced
himself
for
that
and
was
looking
beyond
it
to
the
calm
of
forgiveness
which
should
follow
the
storm
in
which
he
should
so
unwillingly
take
part
no
his
father
was
already
calm
and
reasonable
with
a
dreadful
calm
a
terrifying
reason
here
my
boy
he
said
cruelty
to
dumb
animals
must
be
checked
severely
checked
did
mean
to
be
cruel
said
maurice
said
basingstoke
for
such
was
maurice
surname
wrought
by
want
of
thought
as
well
as
want
of
heart
what
about
your
putting
the
hen
in
the
oven
know
said
maurice
pale
but
determined
i
only
wanted
to
help
her
to
get
her
eggs
hatched
quickly
it
says
in
fowls
for
food
and
fancy
that
heat
hatches
eggs
she
had
any
eggs
said
basingstoke
she
soon
would
have
urged
maurice
thought
a
stitch
in
time
said
his
father
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
must
learn
not
to
think
try
said
maurice
miserably
hoping
for
the
best
intend
that
you
shall
said
basingstoke
afternoon
you
go
to
strongitharm
for
the
remaining
week
of
term
if
i
find
any
more
cruelty
taking
place
during
the
holidays
you
will
go
there
permanently
you
can
go
and
get
ready
father
not
was
all
maurice
found
to
say
sorry
my
boy
said
his
father
much
more
kindly
all
for
your
own
good
and
it
as
painful
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
remember
that
the
cab
will
be
here
at
four
go
and
put
your
things
together
and
jane
shall
pack
for
you
so
the
box
was
packed
mabel
maurice
kiddy
sister
cried
over
everything
as
it
was
put
in
it
was
a
very
wet
day
it
had
been
any
school
but
old
strong
she
sobbed
she
and
her
brother
knew
that
school
well
its
windows
dulled
with
wire
blinds
its
big
alarm
bell
the
high
walls
of
its
grounds
bristling
with
spikes
the
iron
gates
always
locked
through
which
gloomy
boys
imprisoned
scowled
on
a
free
world
strongitharm
was
a
school
backward
and
difficult
boys
need
i
say
more
well
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
box
was
packed
the
cab
was
at
the
door
the
farewells
had
been
said
maurice
determined
that
he
cry
and
he
did
which
gave
him
the
one
touch
of
pride
and
joy
that
such
a
scene
could
yield
then
at
the
last
moment
just
as
father
had
one
leg
in
the
cab
the
taxes
called
father
went
back
into
the
house
to
write
a
cheque
mother
and
mabel
had
retired
in
tears
maurice
used
the
reprieve
to
go
back
after
his
album
already
he
was
planning
how
to
impress
the
other
boys
at
old
strong
and
his
was
really
a
very
fair
collection
he
ran
up
into
the
schoolroom
expecting
to
find
it
empty
but
some
one
was
there
lord
hugh
in
the
very
middle
of
the
brute
said
maurice
know
jolly
well
i
going
away
or
you
would
be
here
and
indeed
the
room
had
never
somehow
been
a
favourite
of
lord
hugh
said
lord
hugh
illustration
you
think
cats
have
such
a
jolly
time
said
lord
hugh
not
a
cat
said
maurice
with
scorn
what
you
always
say
all
that
fuss
about
a
jolly
little
any
one
would
have
thought
be
only
too
glad
to
have
it
to
play
with
i
wonder
how
you
like
being
a
boy
lickings
and
lessons
and
impots
and
sent
back
from
breakfast
to
wash
your
ears
you
wash
yours
anywhere
i
wonder
what
they
say
to
me
if
i
washed
my
ears
on
the
hearthrug
said
lord
hugh
and
washed
an
ear
as
though
he
were
showing
off
said
maurice
again
all
you
can
say
no
it
is
said
lord
hugh
and
stopped
his
say
said
maurice
in
awestruck
tones
you
think
cats
have
such
a
jolly
time
said
lord
hugh
not
a
cat
would
if
i
could
said
maurice
fight
you
you
said
lord
hugh
i
ca
said
maurice
yes
you
can
said
lord
hugh
only
got
to
say
the
word
word
lord
hugh
told
him
the
word
but
i
will
not
tell
you
for
fear
you
should
say
it
by
accident
and
then
be
sorry
if
i
say
that
i
shall
turn
into
a
cat
course
said
the
cat
yes
i
see
said
maurice
i
not
taking
any
thanks
i
want
to
be
a
cat
for
always
need
said
lord
hugh
only
got
to
get
some
one
to
say
to
you
please
leave
off
being
a
cat
and
be
maurice
again
and
there
you
are
maurice
thought
of
strongitharm
he
also
thought
of
the
horror
of
his
father
when
he
should
find
maurice
gone
vanished
not
to
be
traced
be
sorry
then
maurice
told
himself
and
to
the
cat
he
said
suddenly
i
do
it
what
the
word
again
said
the
said
maurice
and
suddenly
the
table
shot
up
to
the
height
of
a
house
the
walls
to
the
height
of
tenement
buildings
the
pattern
on
the
carpet
became
enormous
and
maurice
found
himself
on
all
fours
he
tried
to
stand
up
on
his
feet
but
his
shoulders
were
oddly
heavy
he
could
only
rear
himself
upright
for
a
moment
and
then
fell
heavily
on
his
hands
he
looked
down
at
them
they
seemed
to
have
grown
shorter
and
fatter
and
were
encased
in
black
fur
gloves
he
felt
a
desire
to
walk
on
all
fours
tried
it
did
it
it
was
very
odd
the
movement
of
the
arms
straight
from
the
shoulder
more
like
the
movement
of
the
piston
of
an
engine
than
anything
maurice
could
think
of
at
that
moment
am
asleep
said
maurice
am
dreaming
this
i
am
dreaming
i
am
a
cat
i
hope
i
dreamed
that
about
the
and
lord
hugh
tail
and
dr
strong
did
said
a
voice
he
knew
and
yet
did
know
you
dreaming
this
i
am
said
maurice
now
i
going
to
dream
that
i
fight
that
beastly
black
cat
and
give
him
the
best
licking
he
ever
had
in
his
life
come
on
lord
hugh
a
loud
laugh
answered
him
my
smiling
said
the
voice
he
knew
and
did
know
you
see
you
lord
hugh
a
great
hand
picked
maurice
up
from
the
floor
and
held
him
in
the
air
he
felt
the
position
to
be
not
only
undignified
but
unsafe
and
gave
himself
a
shake
of
mingled
relief
and
resentment
when
the
hand
set
him
down
on
the
inky
are
lord
hugh
now
my
dear
maurice
said
the
voice
and
a
huge
face
came
quite
close
to
his
it
was
his
own
face
as
it
would
have
seemed
through
a
magnifying
glass
and
the
voice
oh
horror
the
voice
was
his
own
voice
maurice
basingstoke
voice
maurice
shrank
from
the
voice
and
he
would
have
liked
to
claw
the
face
but
he
had
had
no
practice
are
lord
hugh
the
voice
repeated
i
am
maurice
i
like
being
maurice
i
am
so
large
and
strong
i
could
drown
you
in
the
my
poor
cat
oh
so
easily
no
do
spit
and
swear
it
bad
manners
even
in
a
cat
shouted
basingstoke
from
between
the
door
and
the
cab
maurice
from
habit
leaped
towards
the
door
no
use
going
said
the
thing
that
looked
like
a
giant
reflection
of
maurice
he
wants
i
did
agree
to
your
being
me
poetry
even
if
it
is
grammar
said
the
thing
that
looked
like
maurice
my
good
cat
do
you
see
that
if
you
are
i
i
must
be
you
otherwise
we
should
interfere
with
time
and
space
upset
the
balance
of
power
and
as
likely
as
not
destroy
the
solar
system
oh
yes
i
you
right
enough
and
shall
be
till
some
one
tells
you
to
change
from
lord
hugh
into
maurice
and
now
you
got
to
find
some
one
to
do
it
thundered
the
voice
of
mr
basingstoke
be
easy
enough
said
maurice
so
said
the
other
i
try
yet
i
want
to
have
some
fun
first
i
shall
catch
heaps
of
mice
so
you
forget
that
your
whiskers
are
cut
off
maurice
cut
them
without
whiskers
how
can
you
judge
of
the
width
of
the
places
you
go
through
take
care
you
do
get
stuck
in
a
hole
that
you
ca
get
out
of
or
go
in
through
my
good
cat
call
me
a
cat
said
maurice
and
felt
that
his
tail
was
growing
thick
and
angry
a
cat
you
know
and
that
little
bit
of
temper
that
i
see
in
your
tail
reminds
me
maurice
felt
himself
gripped
round
the
middle
abruptly
lifted
and
carried
swiftly
through
the
air
the
quickness
of
the
movement
made
him
giddy
the
light
went
so
quickly
past
him
that
it
might
as
well
have
been
darkness
he
saw
nothing
felt
nothing
except
a
sort
of
long
and
then
suddenly
he
was
not
being
moved
he
could
see
now
he
could
feel
he
was
being
held
tight
in
a
sort
of
vice
a
vice
covered
with
chequered
cloth
it
looked
like
the
pattern
very
much
exaggerated
of
his
school
knickerbockers
it
he
was
being
held
between
the
hard
relentless
knees
of
that
creature
that
had
once
been
lord
hugh
and
to
whose
tail
he
had
tied
a
now
was
lord
hugh
and
something
was
being
tied
to
tail
something
mysterious
terrible
very
well
he
would
show
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
anything
that
could
be
attached
to
tails
the
string
rubbed
his
fur
the
wrong
way
it
was
that
that
annoyed
him
not
the
string
itself
and
as
for
what
was
at
the
end
of
the
string
what
that
matter
to
any
sensible
cat
maurice
was
quite
decided
that
he
was
and
would
keep
on
being
a
sensible
cat
the
string
however
and
the
uncomfortable
tight
position
between
those
chequered
knees
something
or
other
was
getting
on
his
nerves
shouted
his
father
below
and
the
maurice
bounded
between
the
knees
of
the
creature
that
wore
his
clothes
and
his
looks
father
this
thing
called
and
sped
away
leaving
maurice
on
the
servant
bed
under
which
lord
hugh
had
taken
refuge
with
his
so
short
and
yet
so
long
a
time
ago
the
stairs
to
the
loud
boots
which
maurice
had
never
before
thought
loud
he
had
often
indeed
wondered
that
any
one
could
object
to
them
he
wondered
now
no
longer
he
heard
the
front
door
slam
that
thing
had
gone
to
strongitharm
that
was
one
comfort
lord
hugh
was
a
boy
now
he
would
know
what
it
was
to
be
a
boy
he
maurice
was
a
cat
and
he
meant
to
taste
fully
all
catty
pleasures
from
milk
to
mice
meanwhile
he
was
without
mice
or
milk
and
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
a
tail
he
could
not
but
feel
that
all
was
not
right
with
his
own
there
was
a
feeling
of
weight
a
feeling
of
discomfort
of
positive
terror
if
he
should
move
what
would
that
thing
that
was
tied
to
his
tail
do
rattle
of
course
oh
but
he
could
not
bear
it
if
that
thing
rattled
nonsense
it
was
only
a
yes
maurice
knew
that
but
all
the
same
if
it
did
rattle
he
moved
his
tail
the
least
little
soft
inch
no
sound
perhaps
really
there
was
anything
tied
to
his
tail
but
he
could
be
sure
unless
he
moved
but
if
he
moved
the
thing
would
rattle
and
if
it
rattled
maurice
felt
sure
that
he
would
expire
or
go
mad
a
mad
cat
what
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
yet
he
could
sit
on
that
bed
for
ever
waiting
waiting
waiting
for
the
dreadful
thing
to
happen
dear
sighed
maurice
the
cat
never
knew
what
people
meant
by
afraid
before
his
was
beating
heavily
against
his
furry
side
his
limbs
were
getting
cramped
he
must
move
he
did
and
instantly
the
awful
thing
happened
the
touched
the
iron
of
the
it
rattled
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
cried
poor
maurice
in
a
heartrending
meaow
that
echoed
through
the
house
he
leaped
from
the
bed
and
tore
through
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
and
behind
him
came
the
most
terrible
thing
in
the
world
people
might
call
it
a
but
he
knew
better
it
was
the
soul
of
all
the
fear
that
ever
had
been
or
ever
could
be
maurice
who
was
a
cat
flew
down
the
stairs
down
down
the
rattling
horror
followed
oh
horrible
down
down
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
horror
caught
by
something
a
banister
a
stopped
the
string
on
maurice
tail
tightened
his
tail
was
jerked
he
was
stopped
but
the
noise
had
stopped
too
maurice
lay
only
just
alive
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
it
was
mabel
who
untied
the
string
and
soothed
his
terrors
with
strokings
and
tender
maurice
was
surprised
to
find
what
a
nice
little
girl
his
sister
really
was
never
tease
you
again
he
tried
to
say
softly
but
that
was
not
what
he
said
what
he
said
was
illustration
it
was
mabel
who
untied
the
string
and
soothed
his
terrors
pussy
nice
poor
pussy
then
said
mabel
and
she
hid
away
the
and
did
not
tell
any
one
this
seemed
unjust
to
maurice
until
he
remembered
that
of
course
mabel
thought
that
he
was
really
lord
hugh
and
that
the
person
who
had
tied
the
tin
to
his
tail
was
her
brother
maurice
then
he
was
half
grateful
she
carried
him
down
in
soft
safe
arms
to
the
kitchen
and
asked
cook
to
give
him
some
milk
me
to
change
back
into
maurice
said
maurice
who
was
quite
worn
out
by
his
cattish
experiences
but
no
one
heard
him
what
they
heard
was
meaow
meeeaow
then
maurice
saw
how
he
had
been
tricked
he
could
be
changed
back
into
a
boy
as
soon
as
any
one
said
to
him
off
being
a
cat
and
be
maurice
again
but
his
tongue
had
no
longer
the
power
to
ask
any
one
to
say
it
he
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
for
one
thing
he
was
not
accustomed
to
sleeping
on
the
kitchen
hearthrug
and
the
blackbeetles
were
too
many
and
too
cordial
he
was
glad
when
cook
came
down
and
turned
him
out
into
the
garden
where
the
october
frost
still
lay
white
on
the
yellowed
stalks
of
sunflowers
and
nasturtiums
he
took
a
walk
climbed
a
tree
failed
to
catch
a
bird
and
felt
better
he
began
also
to
feel
hungry
a
delicious
scent
came
stealing
out
of
the
back
kitchen
door
oh
joy
there
were
to
be
herrings
for
breakfast
maurice
hastened
in
and
took
his
place
on
his
usual
chair
his
mother
said
puss
and
gently
tilted
the
chair
so
that
maurice
fell
off
it
then
the
family
had
herrings
maurice
said
might
give
me
some
and
he
said
it
so
often
that
his
father
who
of
course
heard
only
mewings
said
goodness
sake
put
that
cat
out
of
the
room
maurice
breakfasted
later
in
the
on
herring
heads
but
he
kept
himself
up
with
a
new
and
splendid
idea
they
would
give
him
milk
presently
and
then
they
should
see
he
spent
the
afternoon
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
listening
to
the
conversation
of
his
father
and
mother
it
is
said
that
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
maurice
heard
so
much
that
he
was
surprised
and
humbled
he
heard
his
father
say
that
he
was
a
fine
plucky
little
chap
but
he
needed
a
severe
lesson
and
strongitharm
was
the
man
to
give
it
to
him
he
heard
his
mother
say
things
that
made
his
heart
throb
in
his
throat
and
the
tears
prick
behind
those
green
of
his
he
had
always
thought
his
parents
a
little
bit
unjust
now
they
did
him
so
much
more
than
justice
that
he
felt
quite
small
and
mean
inside
his
illustration
he
landed
there
on
his
four
padded
feet
light
as
a
feather
a
dear
good
affectionate
boy
said
mother
only
his
high
spirits
do
you
think
darling
perhaps
you
were
a
little
hard
on
him
was
for
his
own
good
said
father
course
said
mother
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
him
at
that
dreadful
school
father
was
beginning
when
jane
came
in
with
the
on
a
clattering
tray
whose
sound
made
maurice
tremble
in
every
leg
father
and
mother
began
to
talk
about
the
weather
maurice
felt
very
affectionately
to
both
his
parents
the
natural
way
of
showing
this
was
to
jump
on
to
the
sideboard
and
thence
on
to
his
father
shoulders
he
landed
there
on
his
four
padded
feet
light
as
a
feather
but
father
was
not
pleased
the
cat
he
cried
put
it
out
of
the
room
maurice
was
put
out
his
great
idea
which
was
to
be
carried
out
with
milk
would
certainly
not
be
carried
out
in
the
he
sought
the
kitchen
and
seeing
a
on
the
jumped
up
beside
the
can
and
patted
it
as
he
had
seen
lord
hugh
do
said
a
friend
of
jane
who
happened
to
be
there
that
cat
clever
a
perfect
moral
i
call
her
nothing
to
boast
of
this
time
said
cook
will
say
for
lord
hugh
he
not
often
taken
in
with
a
empty
can
this
was
naturally
mortifying
for
maurice
but
he
pretended
not
to
hear
and
jumped
from
the
window
to
the
and
patted
the
said
the
cook
more
like
it
and
she
poured
him
out
a
full
saucer
and
set
it
on
the
floor
now
was
the
chance
maurice
had
longed
for
now
he
could
carry
out
that
idea
of
his
he
was
very
thirsty
for
he
had
had
nothing
since
that
delicious
breakfast
in
the
but
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
drunk
the
milk
no
he
carefully
dipped
his
right
paw
in
it
for
his
idea
was
to
make
letters
with
it
on
the
kitchen
he
meant
to
write
tell
me
to
leave
off
being
a
cat
and
be
maurice
again
but
he
found
his
paw
a
very
clumsy
pen
and
he
had
to
rub
out
the
first
because
it
only
looked
like
an
accident
then
he
tried
again
and
actually
did
make
a
that
any
person
could
have
read
quite
easily
wish
they
notice
he
said
and
before
he
got
the
written
they
did
notice
the
cat
said
cook
how
he
messing
the
floor
up
and
she
took
away
the
milk
maurice
put
pride
aside
and
mewed
to
have
the
milk
put
down
again
but
he
did
not
get
it
very
weary
very
thirsty
and
very
tired
of
being
lord
hugh
he
presently
found
his
way
to
the
schoolroom
where
mabel
with
patient
toil
was
doing
her
she
took
him
on
her
lap
and
stroked
him
while
she
learned
her
french
verb
he
felt
that
he
was
growing
very
fond
of
her
people
were
quite
right
to
be
kind
to
dumb
animals
presently
she
had
to
stop
stroking
him
and
do
a
map
and
after
that
she
kissed
him
and
put
him
down
and
went
away
all
the
time
she
had
been
doing
the
map
maurice
had
had
but
one
thought
the
moment
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
how
sensible
people
were
who
closed
doors
gently
he
stood
up
in
her
chair
with
one
paw
on
the
map
and
the
other
on
the
ink
unfortunately
the
inkstand
top
was
made
to
dip
pens
in
and
not
to
dip
paws
but
maurice
was
desperate
he
deliberately
upset
the
ink
most
of
it
rolled
over
the
and
fell
pattering
on
the
carpet
but
with
what
was
left
he
wrote
quite
plainly
across
the
map
tell
lord
hugh
to
stop
being
a
cat
and
be
mau
rice
again
he
said
ca
make
any
mistake
about
that
they
did
but
they
made
a
mistake
about
who
had
done
it
and
mabel
was
deprived
of
jam
with
her
supper
bread
her
assurance
that
some
naughty
boy
must
have
come
through
the
window
and
done
it
while
she
was
not
there
convinced
nobody
and
indeed
the
window
was
shut
and
bolted
maurice
wild
with
indignation
did
not
mend
matters
by
seizing
the
opportunity
of
a
few
minutes
solitude
to
write
was
not
mabel
it
was
maur
ice
i
mean
lord
hugh
because
when
that
was
seen
mabel
was
instantly
sent
to
bed
not
fair
cried
maurice
dear
said
maurice
father
that
cat
goes
on
mewing
to
this
extent
you
have
to
get
rid
of
it
illustration
when
jane
went
in
to
put
mabel
light
out
maurice
crept
in
too
maurice
said
not
another
word
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
a
cat
but
to
be
a
cat
that
was
rid
of
he
knew
how
people
got
rid
of
cats
in
a
stricken
silence
he
left
the
room
and
slunk
up
the
stairs
he
dared
not
mew
again
even
at
the
door
of
mabel
room
but
when
jane
went
in
to
put
mabel
light
out
maurice
crept
in
too
and
in
the
dark
tried
with
stifled
mews
and
purrs
to
explain
to
mabel
how
sorry
he
was
mabel
stroked
him
and
he
went
to
sleep
his
last
waking
thought
amazement
at
the
blindness
that
had
once
made
him
call
her
a
silly
little
kid
if
you
have
ever
been
a
cat
you
will
understand
something
of
what
maurice
endured
during
the
dreadful
days
that
followed
if
you
have
not
i
can
never
make
you
understand
fully
there
was
the
affair
of
the
fishmonger
tray
balanced
on
the
wall
by
the
back
door
the
delicious
whiting
maurice
knew
as
well
as
you
do
that
one
must
steal
fish
out
of
other
people
trays
but
the
cat
that
he
was
did
know
there
was
an
inward
struggle
and
maurice
was
beaten
by
the
later
he
was
beaten
by
the
cook
then
there
was
that
very
painful
incident
with
the
butcher
dog
the
flight
across
gardens
the
safety
of
the
plum
tree
gained
only
just
in
time
and
worst
of
all
despair
took
hold
of
him
for
he
saw
that
nothing
he
could
do
would
make
any
one
say
those
simple
words
that
would
release
him
he
had
hoped
that
mabel
might
at
last
be
made
to
understand
but
the
ink
had
failed
him
she
did
not
understand
his
subdued
mewings
and
when
he
got
the
cardboard
letters
and
made
the
same
sentence
with
them
mabel
only
thought
it
was
that
naughty
boy
who
came
through
locked
windows
somehow
he
could
not
spell
before
any
one
his
nerves
were
not
what
they
had
been
his
brain
now
gave
him
no
new
ideas
he
felt
that
he
was
really
growing
like
a
cat
in
his
mind
his
interest
in
his
meals
grew
beyond
even
what
it
had
been
when
they
were
a
schoolboy
meals
he
hunted
mice
with
growing
enthusiasm
though
the
loss
of
his
whiskers
to
measure
narrow
places
with
made
hunting
difficult
he
grew
expert
in
and
often
got
quite
near
to
a
bird
before
it
flew
away
laughing
at
him
but
all
the
time
in
his
heart
he
was
very
very
miserable
and
so
the
week
went
by
maurice
in
his
cat
shape
dreaded
more
and
more
the
time
when
lord
hugh
in
the
boy
shape
should
come
back
from
strongitharm
he
knew
who
better
exactly
the
kind
of
things
boys
do
to
cats
and
he
trembled
to
the
end
of
his
handsome
tail
and
then
the
boy
came
home
from
strongitharm
and
at
the
first
sound
of
his
boots
in
the
hall
maurice
in
the
cat
body
fled
with
silent
haste
to
hide
in
the
here
ten
minutes
later
the
boy
that
had
come
back
from
strongitharm
found
him
maurice
fluffed
up
his
tail
and
unsheathed
his
claws
whatever
this
boy
was
going
to
do
to
him
maurice
meant
to
resist
and
his
resistance
should
hurt
the
boy
as
much
as
possible
i
am
sorry
to
say
maurice
swore
softly
among
the
boots
but
is
not
really
wrong
out
you
old
duffer
said
lord
hugh
in
the
boy
shape
of
maurice
not
going
to
hurt
you
see
to
that
said
maurice
backing
into
the
corner
all
teeth
and
claws
i
had
such
a
time
said
lord
hugh
no
use
you
know
old
chap
i
can
see
where
you
are
by
your
green
eyes
my
word
they
do
shine
i
been
caned
and
shut
up
in
a
dark
room
and
given
thousands
of
lines
to
write
out
been
beaten
too
if
you
come
to
that
mewed
maurice
the
butcher
dog
it
was
an
intense
relief
to
speak
to
some
one
who
could
understand
his
mews
i
suppose
it
pax
for
the
future
said
lord
hugh
you
wo
come
out
you
wo
please
leave
off
being
a
cat
and
be
maurice
again
and
instantly
maurice
amid
a
heap
of
goloshes
and
old
tennis
bats
felt
with
a
swelling
heart
that
he
was
no
longer
a
cat
no
more
of
those
undignified
four
legs
those
tiresome
pointed
ears
so
difficult
to
wash
that
furry
coat
that
contemptible
tail
and
that
terrible
inability
to
express
all
one
feelings
in
two
words
and
he
scrambled
out
of
the
cupboard
and
the
boots
and
goloshes
fell
off
him
like
spray
off
a
bather
he
stood
upright
in
those
very
chequered
knickerbockers
that
were
so
terrible
when
their
knees
held
one
while
things
were
tied
to
one
tail
he
was
face
to
face
with
another
boy
exactly
like
himself
have
changed
then
but
there
ca
be
two
maurices
be
not
if
i
know
it
said
the
other
boy
life
a
dog
life
quick
before
any
one
comes
what
asked
maurice
tell
me
to
leave
off
being
a
boy
and
to
be
lord
hugh
cecil
again
maurice
told
him
at
once
and
at
once
the
boy
was
gone
and
there
was
lord
hugh
in
his
own
shape
purring
politely
yet
with
a
watchful
eye
on
maurice
movements
you
need
be
afraid
old
chap
it
pax
right
enough
maurice
murmured
in
the
ear
of
lord
hugh
and
lord
hugh
arching
his
back
under
maurice
stroking
hand
replied
with
a
that
spoke
volumes
maurice
here
you
are
it
nice
of
you
to
be
nice
to
lord
hugh
when
it
was
because
of
him
you
a
good
old
chap
said
maurice
carelessly
you
not
half
a
bad
old
girl
see
mabel
almost
wept
for
joy
at
this
magnificent
compliment
and
lord
hugh
himself
took
on
a
more
happy
and
confident
air
please
dismiss
any
fears
which
you
may
entertain
that
after
this
maurice
became
a
model
boy
he
did
but
he
was
much
nicer
than
before
the
conversation
which
he
overheard
when
he
was
a
cat
makes
him
more
patient
with
his
father
and
mother
and
he
is
almost
always
nice
to
mabel
for
he
can
not
forget
all
that
she
was
to
him
when
he
wore
the
shape
of
lord
hugh
his
father
attributes
all
the
improvement
in
his
son
character
to
that
week
at
strongitharm
which
as
you
know
maurice
never
had
lord
hugh
character
is
unchanged
cats
learn
slowly
and
with
difficulty
only
maurice
and
lord
hugh
know
the
truth
maurice
has
never
told
it
to
any
one
except
me
and
lord
hugh
is
a
very
reserved
cat
he
never
at
any
time
had
that
free
flow
of
mew
which
distinguished
and
endangered
the
of
maurice
ii
the
mixed
mine
the
ship
was
first
sighted
off
dungeness
she
was
labouring
heavily
her
paint
was
peculiar
and
her
rig
outlandish
she
looked
like
a
golden
ship
out
of
a
painted
picture
if
i
ever
see
such
a
rig
nor
such
lines
neither
old
hawkhurst
said
it
was
a
late
afternoon
wild
and
grey
clouds
drove
across
the
sky
like
flocks
of
hurried
camels
the
waves
were
purple
and
blue
and
in
the
west
a
streak
of
green
light
was
all
that
stood
for
the
splendours
of
sunset
do
be
a
rum
said
young
benenden
who
had
strolled
along
the
beach
with
the
glasses
the
gentleman
gave
him
for
saving
the
little
boy
from
drowning
know
as
i
ever
see
another
just
like
her
give
half
a
dollar
to
any
chap
as
can
tell
me
where
she
hails
from
and
what
port
it
is
where
they
has
ships
o
that
cut
said
haversham
to
the
group
that
had
now
gathered
exclaimed
young
benenden
from
under
his
going
and
she
went
her
bow
went
down
suddenly
and
she
stood
stern
up
in
the
water
like
a
duck
after
rain
then
quite
slowly
with
no
unseemly
hurry
but
with
no
moment
change
of
what
seemed
to
be
her
fixed
purpose
the
ship
sank
and
the
grey
rolling
waves
wiped
out
the
place
where
she
had
been
now
i
hope
you
will
not
expect
me
to
tell
you
anything
more
about
this
ship
because
there
is
nothing
more
to
tell
what
country
she
came
from
what
port
she
was
bound
for
what
cargo
she
carried
and
what
kind
of
tongue
her
crew
spoke
all
these
things
are
dead
secrets
and
a
dead
secret
is
a
secret
that
nobody
knows
no
other
secrets
are
dead
secrets
even
i
do
not
know
this
one
or
i
would
tell
you
at
once
for
i
at
least
have
no
secrets
from
you
illustration
her
bow
went
down
suddenly
when
ships
go
down
off
dungeness
things
from
them
have
a
way
of
being
washed
up
on
the
sands
of
that
bay
which
curves
from
dungeness
to
folkestone
where
the
sea
has
bitten
a
piece
out
of
the
land
just
such
a
piece
as
you
bite
out
of
a
slice
of
bits
of
wood
tangled
with
ropes
broken
furniture
ships
biscuits
in
barrels
and
kegs
that
have
held
brandy
seamen
chests
and
sometimes
sadder
things
that
we
will
not
talk
about
just
now
now
if
you
live
by
the
sea
and
are
you
know
that
if
you
find
anything
on
the
seashore
i
do
mean
starfish
or
or
jellyfish
and
but
anything
out
of
a
ship
that
you
would
really
like
to
keep
your
duty
is
to
take
it
up
to
the
and
say
i
found
this
then
the
will
send
it
to
the
proper
authority
and
one
of
these
days
you
get
a
reward
of
of
the
value
of
whatever
it
was
that
you
picked
up
but
of
the
value
of
anything
or
even
of
its
value
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
as
the
thing
itself
if
it
happened
to
be
the
kind
of
thing
you
want
but
if
you
are
not
and
do
not
live
by
the
sea
but
in
a
nice
little
villa
in
a
nice
little
suburb
where
all
the
furniture
is
new
and
the
servants
wear
white
aprons
and
white
caps
with
long
strings
in
the
afternoon
then
you
wo
know
anything
about
your
duty
and
if
you
find
anything
by
the
sea
you
think
that
findings
are
keepings
edward
was
not
and
he
kept
everything
he
found
including
till
the
landlady
of
the
lodgings
where
his
aunt
was
threw
his
collection
into
the
being
a
quiet
and
persevering
little
boy
he
did
not
cry
or
complain
but
having
meekly
followed
his
treasures
to
their
long
home
the
pig
was
six
feet
from
nose
to
tail
and
ate
the
dead
as
easily
and
happily
as
your
father
eats
an
oyster
he
started
out
to
make
a
new
collection
and
the
first
thing
he
found
was
an
that
was
pink
and
green
and
blue
inside
and
the
second
was
an
old
boot
very
old
indeed
and
the
third
was
it
was
a
square
case
of
old
leather
embossed
with
odd
little
figures
of
men
and
animals
and
words
that
edward
could
not
read
it
was
oblong
and
had
no
key
but
a
sort
of
leather
hasp
and
was
curiously
knotted
with
string
rather
like
a
and
edward
opened
it
there
were
several
things
inside
instruments
some
rather
like
those
in
the
little
box
of
mathematical
instruments
that
he
had
had
as
a
prize
at
school
and
some
like
nothing
he
had
ever
seen
before
and
in
a
deep
groove
of
the
russet
soaked
velvet
lining
lay
a
neat
little
brass
telescope
and
and
so
forth
are
of
little
use
on
a
sandy
shore
but
you
can
always
look
through
a
telescope
edward
picked
it
out
and
put
it
to
his
eye
and
tried
to
see
through
it
a
little
tug
that
was
sturdily
puffing
up
channel
he
failed
to
find
the
tug
and
found
himself
gazing
at
a
little
cloud
on
the
horizon
as
he
looked
it
grew
larger
and
darker
and
presently
a
spot
of
rain
fell
on
his
nose
he
rubbed
it
off
on
his
jersey
sleeve
i
am
sorry
to
say
and
not
on
his
handkerchief
then
he
looked
through
the
glass
again
but
he
found
he
needed
both
hands
to
keep
it
steady
so
he
set
down
the
box
with
the
other
instruments
on
the
sand
at
his
feet
and
put
the
glass
to
his
eye
again
he
never
saw
the
box
again
for
in
his
unpractised
efforts
to
cover
the
tug
with
his
glass
he
found
himself
looking
at
the
shore
instead
of
at
the
sea
and
the
shore
looked
so
odd
that
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
stop
looking
at
it
he
had
thought
it
was
a
sandy
shore
but
almost
at
once
he
saw
that
it
was
not
sand
but
fine
shingle
and
the
discovery
of
this
mistake
surprised
him
so
much
that
he
kept
on
looking
at
the
shingle
through
the
little
telescope
which
showed
it
quite
plainly
and
as
he
looked
the
shingle
grew
coarser
it
was
stones
now
quite
stones
large
stones
enormous
stones
something
hard
pressed
against
his
foot
and
he
lowered
the
glass
he
was
surrounded
by
big
stones
and
they
all
seemed
to
be
moving
some
were
tumbling
off
others
that
lay
in
heaps
below
them
and
others
were
rolling
away
from
the
beach
in
every
direction
and
the
place
where
he
had
put
down
the
box
was
covered
with
great
stones
which
he
could
not
move
edward
was
very
much
upset
he
had
never
been
accustomed
to
great
stones
that
moved
about
when
no
one
was
touching
them
and
he
looked
round
for
some
one
to
ask
how
it
had
happened
the
only
person
in
sight
was
another
boy
in
a
blue
jersey
with
red
letters
on
its
chest
said
edward
and
the
boy
also
said
along
here
said
edward
i
show
you
something
the
boy
remarked
and
came
the
boy
was
staying
at
the
camp
where
the
white
tents
were
below
the
grand
redoubt
his
home
was
quite
unlike
edward
though
he
also
lived
with
his
aunt
the
boy
home
was
very
dirty
and
very
small
and
nothing
in
it
was
ever
in
its
right
place
there
was
no
furniture
to
speak
of
the
servants
did
not
wear
white
caps
with
long
streamers
because
there
were
no
servants
his
uncle
was
a
and
his
aunt
went
out
washing
but
he
had
felt
just
the
same
pleasure
in
being
shown
things
that
edward
or
you
or
i
might
have
felt
and
he
went
climbing
over
the
big
stones
to
where
edward
stood
waiting
for
him
in
a
sort
of
pit
among
the
stones
with
the
little
telescope
in
his
hand
say
said
edward
you
see
any
one
move
these
stones
ai
only
just
come
up
on
to
the
said
the
boy
who
was
called
gustus
all
came
round
me
said
edward
rather
pale
did
see
any
one
shoving
them
you
of
the
boy
inquired
i
said
edward
bright
i
did
i
was
just
taking
a
squint
through
this
little
telescope
i
found
and
they
came
rolling
up
to
me
see
what
you
found
said
gustus
and
edward
gave
him
the
glass
he
directed
it
with
inexpert
fingers
to
the
so
little
trodden
that
on
it
the
grass
grows
and
the
and
even
convolvulus
and
look
cried
edward
very
loud
at
the
grass
gustus
let
the
glass
fall
to
long
arm
length
and
said
the
grass
and
flowers
on
the
had
grown
a
foot
and
a
half
quite
tropical
they
looked
said
edward
the
matter
wiv
everyfink
said
gustus
must
both
be
a
bit
balmy
seems
ter
me
balmy
asked
edward
your
chump
looney
like
what
you
and
me
is
said
gustus
i
sees
things
then
i
sees
you
was
only
fancy
i
expect
said
edward
expect
the
grass
on
the
was
always
like
that
really
have
a
look
through
your
at
that
little
barge
said
gustus
still
holding
the
glass
on
outer
these
was
a
box
said
edward
box
i
found
with
lots
of
jolly
things
in
it
i
laid
it
down
somewhere
and
that
it
over
there
gustus
asked
and
levelled
the
glass
at
a
dark
object
a
hundred
yards
away
it
only
an
old
boot
i
say
this
is
a
fine
it
does
make
things
come
big
not
it
i
certain
i
put
it
down
somewhere
just
here
oh
illustration
he
said
and
pointed
he
snatched
the
glass
from
gustus
he
said
and
pointed
a
hundred
yards
away
stood
a
boot
about
as
big
as
the
bath
you
see
marat
in
at
madame
tussaud
me
said
gustus
asleep
both
of
us
and
as
things
grow
while
we
look
at
them
we
not
dreaming
edward
objected
let
me
pinch
you
and
you
see
fun
in
that
said
gustus
you
what
it
the
that
what
it
is
ever
see
any
conjuring
i
see
a
chap
at
the
mile
end
empire
what
made
things
turn
into
things
like
winking
the
that
what
it
is
ca
be
said
the
little
boy
who
lived
in
a
villa
it
said
the
little
boy
who
lived
in
a
slum
says
there
ai
no
bounds
to
the
wonders
of
science
blest
if
this
ai
one
of
me
look
said
edward
right
only
you
mark
me
whatever
you
sets
eyes
on
grow
and
grow
like
the
the
conjurer
had
under
the
wipe
do
you
look
at
that
all
hold
on
i
put
something
up
for
you
to
look
at
a
mark
like
something
as
does
matter
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
hold
this
up
he
said
you
look
next
moment
he
had
dropped
the
which
swollen
as
it
was
with
the
magic
of
the
glass
lay
like
a
snake
on
the
stone
at
his
feet
so
the
glass
a
magic
glass
as
of
course
you
know
already
said
gustus
i
like
to
look
at
my
victuals
through
that
there
thus
we
find
edward
of
the
villa
and
through
him
gustus
of
the
slum
in
possession
of
a
unique
instrument
of
magic
what
could
they
do
with
it
this
was
the
question
which
they
talked
over
every
time
they
met
and
they
met
continually
edward
aunt
who
at
home
watched
him
as
cats
watch
mice
rashly
believed
that
at
the
seaside
there
was
no
mischief
for
a
boy
to
get
into
and
the
gentleman
who
commanded
the
tented
camp
believed
in
the
ennobling
effects
of
liberty
after
the
boot
neither
had
dared
to
look
at
anything
through
the
telescope
and
so
they
looked
it
and
polished
it
on
their
sleeves
till
it
shone
again
both
were
agreed
that
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
get
some
money
and
look
at
it
so
that
it
would
grow
big
but
gustus
never
had
any
and
edward
had
had
his
confiscated
to
pay
for
a
window
he
had
not
intended
to
break
gustus
felt
certain
that
some
one
would
find
out
about
the
and
take
it
away
from
them
his
experience
was
that
anything
you
happened
to
like
was
always
taken
away
edward
knew
that
his
aunt
would
want
to
take
the
telescope
away
to
care
of
for
him
this
had
already
happened
with
the
carved
chessmen
that
his
father
had
sent
him
from
india
been
thinking
said
gustus
on
the
third
day
i
a
man
to
be
a
burglar
you
has
to
use
your
headpiece
in
that
trade
i
tell
you
so
i
do
think
thinking
swipes
like
some
blokes
do
and
i
think
it
do
turn
everything
big
an
if
we
could
find
out
what
it
do
turn
big
we
could
see
what
we
wanted
to
turn
big
or
what
it
did
turn
big
and
then
it
would
turn
anything
big
except
what
we
wanted
it
to
see
edward
did
not
see
and
i
do
suppose
you
do
either
so
gustus
went
on
to
explain
that
teacher
had
told
him
there
were
some
substances
impervious
to
light
and
some
to
cold
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
that
what
they
wanted
was
a
substance
that
should
be
impervious
to
the
magic
effects
of
the
if
we
get
a
tanner
and
set
it
on
a
plate
and
squint
at
it
it
get
bigger
but
so
the
plate
and
we
do
want
to
litter
the
place
up
with
plates
the
bigness
of
cartwheels
but
if
the
plate
did
get
big
we
could
look
at
the
tanner
till
it
covered
the
plate
and
then
go
on
looking
and
looking
and
looking
and
see
nothing
but
the
tanner
till
it
was
as
big
as
a
circus
see
this
time
edward
did
see
but
they
got
no
further
because
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
circus
there
was
a
circus
at
dymchurch
just
then
and
that
was
what
made
gustus
think
of
the
sixpence
growing
to
that
size
it
was
a
very
nice
circus
and
all
the
boys
from
the
camp
went
to
it
also
edward
who
managed
to
scramble
over
and
wriggle
under
benches
till
he
was
sitting
near
his
friend
illustration
far
above
him
and
every
one
else
towered
the
elephant
it
was
the
size
of
the
elephant
that
did
it
edward
had
not
seen
an
elephant
before
and
when
he
saw
it
instead
of
saying
a
size
he
is
as
everybody
else
did
he
said
to
himself
a
size
i
could
make
him
and
pulled
out
the
and
by
a
miracle
of
good
luck
or
bad
got
it
levelled
at
the
elephant
as
it
went
by
he
turned
the
glass
slowly
as
it
went
out
and
the
elephant
only
just
got
out
in
time
another
moment
and
it
would
have
been
too
big
to
get
through
the
door
the
audience
cheered
madly
they
thought
it
was
a
clever
trick
and
so
it
would
have
been
very
clever
silly
cuckoo
said
gustus
bitterly
you
turned
that
great
thing
loose
on
the
country
and
how
his
keeper
to
manage
him
could
make
the
keeper
big
too
if
i
was
you
i
should
just
bunk
out
and
do
it
edward
obeyed
slipped
under
the
canvas
of
the
circus
tent
and
found
himself
on
the
yellow
trampled
grass
of
the
field
among
and
dirty
paper
far
above
him
and
every
one
else
towered
the
elephant
it
was
now
as
big
as
the
church
edward
pointed
the
glass
at
the
man
who
was
patting
the
foot
that
was
as
far
up
as
he
could
reach
and
telling
it
to
down
with
you
he
was
very
much
frightened
he
did
not
know
whether
you
could
be
put
in
prison
for
making
an
elephant
keeper
about
forty
times
his
proper
size
but
he
felt
that
something
must
be
done
to
control
the
gigantic
mountain
of
living
flesh
so
he
looked
at
the
keeper
through
the
and
the
keeper
remained
his
normal
size
in
the
shock
of
this
failure
he
dropped
the
picked
it
up
and
tried
once
more
to
fix
the
keeper
instead
he
only
got
a
circle
of
elephant
and
while
he
was
trying
to
find
the
keeper
and
finding
nothing
but
more
and
more
of
the
elephant
a
shout
startled
him
and
he
dropped
the
glass
once
more
he
was
a
very
clumsy
little
boy
was
edward
said
one
of
the
men
a
turn
it
give
me
i
thought
grown
as
big
as
a
railway
station
me
if
i
did
that
rum
said
another
did
i
he
said
a
third
to
me
he
a
bit
below
his
usual
figure
got
a
bit
thin
or
somethink
ai
he
edward
slipped
back
into
the
tent
unobserved
all
right
he
whispered
to
his
friend
gone
back
to
his
proper
size
and
the
man
did
change
at
all
gustus
said
slowly
all
right
conjuring
a
rum
thing
you
do
never
know
where
you
are
you
think
you
might
as
well
be
a
conjurer
as
a
burglar
suggested
edward
who
had
had
his
friend
criminal
future
rather
painfully
on
his
mind
for
the
last
hour
might
said
gustus
me
my
people
ai
dooks
to
set
me
up
on
any
such
a
swell
lay
as
conjuring
now
i
going
to
think
i
am
you
hold
your
jaw
and
look
at
the
dona
of
griceful
barebacked
hact
that
evening
after
tea
edward
went
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
to
the
place
on
the
shore
where
the
big
stones
had
taught
him
the
magic
of
the
gustus
was
already
at
the
tryst
here
he
said
to
do
something
brave
and
fearless
i
am
like
lord
nelson
and
the
boy
on
the
you
out
with
that
an
i
let
you
look
at
then
we
know
where
we
are
you
turn
into
a
giant
care
i
sha
bloke
did
said
edward
cautiously
only
works
by
the
seashore
said
gustus
reproachfully
been
to
think
what
you
been
what
about
the
elephant
my
emernent
scientister
now
then
very
much
afraid
edward
pulled
out
the
glass
and
looked
and
nothing
happened
number
one
said
gustus
number
two
he
snatched
the
telescope
from
edward
hand
and
turned
it
round
and
looked
through
the
other
end
at
the
great
stones
edward
standing
by
saw
them
get
smaller
and
smaller
turn
to
pebbles
to
beach
to
sand
when
gustus
turned
the
glass
to
the
giant
grass
and
flowers
on
the
they
also
drew
back
into
themselves
got
smaller
and
smaller
and
presently
were
as
they
had
been
before
ever
edward
picked
up
the
magic
we
know
all
about
it
i
think
said
gustus
we
have
a
look
at
that
there
model
engine
of
yours
that
you
say
works
illustration
it
became
a
quite
efficient
motor
they
did
they
had
a
look
at
it
through
the
and
it
became
a
quite
efficient
motor
of
rather
an
odd
pattern
it
is
true
and
very
bumpy
but
capable
of
quite
a
decent
speed
they
went
up
to
the
hills
in
it
and
so
odd
was
its
design
that
no
one
who
saw
it
ever
forgot
it
people
talk
about
that
rummy
motor
at
bonnington
and
aldington
to
this
day
they
stopped
often
to
use
the
on
various
objects
trees
for
instance
could
be
made
to
grow
surprisingly
and
there
were
patches
of
giant
wheat
found
that
year
near
ashford
that
were
never
satisfactorily
accounted
for
blackberries
too
could
be
enlarged
to
a
most
wonderful
and
delicious
fruit
and
the
sudden
growth
of
a
fugitive
found
in
edward
pocket
and
placed
on
the
hand
was
a
happy
surprise
when
you
scraped
the
pocket
dirt
off
the
outside
you
had
a
pound
of
delicious
toffee
not
so
happy
was
the
incident
of
the
earwig
which
crawled
into
view
when
edward
was
enlarging
a
wild
strawberry
and
had
grown
the
size
of
a
rat
before
the
slow
but
horrified
edward
gained
courage
to
shake
it
off
it
was
a
beautiful
drive
as
they
came
home
they
met
a
woman
driving
a
little
cow
it
went
by
on
one
side
of
the
engine
and
the
woman
went
by
on
the
other
when
they
were
restored
to
each
other
the
cow
was
nearly
the
size
of
a
and
the
woman
did
not
recognise
it
she
ran
back
along
the
road
after
her
cow
which
must
she
said
have
taken
fright
at
the
beastly
motor
she
scolded
violently
as
she
went
so
the
boys
had
to
make
the
cow
small
again
when
she
looking
is
all
very
well
said
gustus
we
got
our
fortune
to
make
i
do
think
we
got
to
get
hold
of
a
tanner
or
a
bob
would
be
better
but
this
was
not
possible
because
that
broken
window
was
paid
for
and
gustus
never
had
any
money
ought
to
be
the
benefactors
of
the
human
race
said
edward
all
the
good
things
more
and
all
the
bad
things
less
and
was
all
very
well
but
the
cow
had
been
a
great
success
as
gustus
reminded
him
see
i
shall
have
to
do
some
of
my
thinking
he
added
they
stopped
in
a
quiet
road
close
by
dymchurch
the
engine
was
made
small
again
and
edward
went
home
with
it
under
his
arm
it
was
the
next
day
that
they
found
the
shilling
on
the
road
they
could
hardly
believe
their
good
luck
they
went
out
on
to
the
shore
with
it
put
it
on
edward
hand
while
gustus
looked
at
it
with
the
glass
and
the
shilling
began
to
grow
as
big
as
a
saucer
said
edward
it
heavy
i
rest
it
on
these
stones
it
as
big
as
a
plate
it
as
big
as
a
it
as
big
as
a
and
it
was
said
gustus
go
and
borrow
a
cart
to
take
it
away
come
on
but
edward
could
not
come
on
his
hand
was
in
the
hollow
between
the
two
stones
and
above
lay
tons
of
silver
he
could
not
move
and
the
stones
could
move
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
look
at
the
great
round
lump
of
silver
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
till
it
got
small
enough
for
edward
to
lift
it
and
then
unfortunately
gustus
looked
a
little
too
long
and
the
shilling
having
gone
back
to
its
own
size
went
a
little
further
and
it
went
to
sixpenny
size
and
then
went
out
altogether
so
nobody
got
anything
by
that
and
now
came
the
time
when
as
was
to
be
expected
edward
dropped
the
telescope
in
his
aunt
presence
she
said
that
picked
it
up
with
quite
unfair
quickness
and
looked
through
it
and
through
the
open
window
at
a
which
instantly
swelled
to
the
size
of
a
goodness
what
a
strong
glass
said
the
aunt
it
said
edward
gently
taking
it
from
her
he
looked
at
the
ship
through
the
glass
other
end
till
she
got
to
her
proper
size
again
and
then
smaller
he
just
stopped
in
time
to
prevent
its
disappearing
altogether
take
care
of
it
for
you
said
the
aunt
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
edward
said
to
his
aunt
it
was
a
terrible
moment
edward
quite
frenzied
by
his
own
courage
turned
the
glass
on
one
object
after
another
the
furniture
grew
as
he
looked
and
when
he
lowered
the
glass
the
aunt
was
pinned
fast
between
a
monster
and
a
great
chiffonier
said
edward
i
sha
let
you
out
till
you
say
you
take
it
to
take
care
of
either
have
it
your
own
way
said
the
aunt
faintly
and
closed
her
eyes
when
she
opened
them
the
furniture
was
its
right
size
and
edward
was
gone
he
had
twinges
of
conscience
but
the
aunt
never
mentioned
the
subject
again
i
have
reason
to
suppose
that
supposed
that
she
had
had
a
fit
of
an
unusual
and
alarming
nature
next
day
the
boys
in
the
camp
were
to
go
back
to
their
slums
edward
and
gustus
parted
on
the
seashore
and
edward
cried
he
had
never
met
a
boy
whom
he
liked
as
he
liked
gustus
and
gustus
himself
was
almost
melted
will
say
for
you
you
more
like
a
man
and
less
like
a
snivelling
white
rabbit
now
than
what
you
was
when
i
met
you
well
we
ai
done
nothing
to
speak
of
with
that
there
conjuring
trick
of
yours
but
a
right
good
time
so
long
see
you
some
day
edward
hesitated
spluttered
and
still
weeping
flung
his
arms
round
gustus
none
o
that
said
gustus
sternly
you
ai
man
enough
to
know
better
i
am
shake
like
a
briton
right
about
face
and
part
game
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
edward
went
back
to
his
aunt
snivelling
defenceless
but
happy
he
had
never
had
a
friend
except
gustus
and
now
he
had
given
gustus
the
greatest
treasure
that
he
possessed
for
edward
was
not
such
a
white
rabbit
as
he
seemed
and
in
that
last
embrace
he
had
managed
to
slip
the
little
telescope
into
the
pocket
of
the
reefer
coat
which
gustus
wore
ready
for
his
journey
it
was
the
greatest
treasure
that
edward
had
but
it
was
also
the
greatest
responsibility
so
that
while
he
felt
the
joy
of
he
also
felt
the
rapture
of
relief
life
is
full
of
such
mixed
moments
and
the
holidays
ended
and
edward
went
back
to
his
villa
be
sure
he
had
given
gustus
his
home
address
and
begged
him
to
write
but
gustus
never
did
presently
edward
father
came
home
from
india
and
they
left
his
aunt
to
her
villa
and
went
to
live
at
a
jolly
little
house
on
a
sloping
hill
at
chiselhurst
which
was
edward
father
very
own
they
were
not
rich
and
edward
could
not
go
to
a
very
good
school
and
though
there
was
enough
to
eat
and
wear
what
there
was
was
very
plain
and
father
had
been
wounded
and
somehow
had
not
got
a
pension
now
one
night
in
the
next
summer
edward
woke
up
in
his
bed
with
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
and
there
was
a
dark
figure
was
squeezing
itself
through
the
window
edward
was
far
too
frightened
to
scream
he
simply
lay
and
listened
to
his
heart
it
was
like
listening
to
a
cheap
american
clock
the
next
moment
a
lantern
flashed
in
his
eyes
and
a
masked
face
bent
over
him
does
your
father
keep
his
money
said
a
muffled
voice
the
replied
the
wretched
edward
truthfully
mean
what
he
got
in
the
house
his
trousers
pocket
said
edward
he
puts
it
in
the
drawer
at
night
must
go
and
get
it
said
the
burglar
for
such
he
plainly
was
i
said
edward
wondering
how
he
could
get
out
of
betraying
his
father
confidence
and
being
branded
as
a
criminal
said
the
burglar
in
an
awful
voice
up
and
go
said
edward
and
he
was
as
much
surprised
at
his
courage
as
you
are
said
the
burglar
flinging
off
his
mask
see
you
such
a
white
rabbit
as
what
i
thought
you
gustus
said
edward
gustus
i
so
glad
oh
gustus
i
so
sorry
i
always
hoped
you
would
be
a
burglar
and
now
you
are
am
so
said
gustus
with
pride
he
added
sadly
is
my
first
burglary
it
be
the
last
suggested
edward
replied
gustus
on
you
do
anything
said
edward
see
said
gustus
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
a
confidential
attitude
with
the
dark
lantern
in
one
hand
and
the
mask
in
the
other
you
as
hard
up
as
we
are
there
not
much
of
a
living
to
be
made
honest
i
sure
i
wonder
we
do
all
of
us
turn
burglars
so
i
do
and
that
glass
of
yours
you
little
beggar
you
did
me
proper
sticking
of
that
thing
in
my
pocket
like
what
you
did
well
it
kept
us
alive
last
winter
that
a
cert
i
used
to
look
at
the
victuals
with
it
like
what
i
said
i
would
a
farden
worth
was
a
dinner
for
three
when
that
glass
was
about
and
a
o
scraps
turned
into
a
big
almost
they
used
to
wonder
how
i
got
so
much
for
the
money
but
i
always
afraid
o
being
found
out
or
of
losing
the
blessed
or
of
some
one
pinching
it
so
we
got
to
do
what
i
always
said
make
some
use
of
it
and
if
i
go
along
and
nick
your
father
dibs
we
make
our
fortunes
right
away
said
edward
i
ask
father
gustus
was
crisp
and
contemptuous
think
you
was
off
your
chump
and
he
get
me
lagged
would
be
stealing
said
edward
when
you
pay
it
back
it
would
said
edward
do
ask
me
i
ca
i
shall
said
gustus
his
room
do
said
edward
got
a
of
my
own
give
you
that
said
gustus
the
blue
monkeys
could
you
say
so
come
on
he
pulled
edward
out
of
bed
by
the
leg
hurried
his
clothes
on
anyhow
and
him
through
the
window
and
down
by
the
ivy
and
the
roof
they
stood
face
to
face
in
the
sloping
garden
and
edward
teeth
chattered
gustus
caught
him
by
his
hand
and
led
him
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
shrubbery
where
the
rockery
was
gustus
stooped
and
dragged
out
a
big
clinker
then
another
and
another
there
was
a
hole
like
a
big
if
edward
had
really
been
a
white
rabbit
it
would
just
have
fitted
him
go
first
said
gustus
and
went
on
he
said
hollowly
from
inside
and
edward
too
went
it
was
dreadful
crawling
into
that
damp
hole
in
the
dark
as
his
head
got
through
the
hole
he
saw
that
it
led
to
a
cave
and
below
him
stood
a
dark
figure
the
lantern
was
on
the
ground
on
said
gustus
catch
you
if
you
fall
with
a
rush
and
a
scramble
edward
got
in
caves
said
gustus
chap
i
know
that
goes
about
the
country
bottoming
told
me
about
it
and
i
nosed
about
and
found
he
lived
here
so
then
i
thought
what
a
go
so
now
we
put
your
down
and
look
at
it
and
we
have
a
and
you
can
pretend
to
find
it
said
edward
briefly
and
firmly
a
man
said
gustus
then
he
led
the
way
through
a
maze
of
chalk
caves
till
they
came
to
a
convenient
spot
which
he
had
marked
and
now
edward
emptied
his
pockets
on
the
sand
he
had
brought
all
the
contents
of
his
and
there
was
more
silver
than
gold
and
more
copper
than
either
and
more
odd
rubbish
than
there
was
anything
else
you
know
what
a
boy
pockets
are
like
stones
and
putty
and
and
marbles
i
urge
in
excuse
that
edward
was
a
very
little
boy
a
bit
of
plasticine
one
or
two
bits
of
wood
time
to
sort
said
gustus
and
putting
the
lantern
in
a
suitable
position
he
got
out
the
glass
and
began
to
look
through
it
at
the
tumbled
heap
and
the
heap
began
to
grow
it
grew
out
sideways
till
it
touched
the
walls
of
the
recess
and
outwards
till
it
touched
the
top
of
the
recess
and
then
it
slowly
worked
out
into
the
big
cave
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
boys
everything
grew
stones
putty
money
wood
plasticine
edward
patted
the
growing
mass
as
though
it
were
alive
and
he
loved
it
and
gustus
said
clothes
and
beef
and
bread
and
tea
and
coffee
and
baccy
and
a
good
school
and
me
a
engineer
i
see
it
all
and
stop
said
edward
suddenly
gustus
dropped
the
telescope
it
rolled
away
into
the
darkness
you
done
it
said
edward
said
gustus
hand
said
edward
fast
between
the
rock
and
the
gold
and
things
find
the
glass
and
make
it
go
smaller
so
that
i
can
get
my
hand
out
but
gustus
could
not
find
the
glass
and
what
is
more
no
one
ever
has
found
it
to
this
day
no
good
said
gustus
at
last
go
and
find
your
father
they
must
come
and
dig
you
out
of
this
precious
tom
tiddler
ground
they
lag
you
if
they
see
you
you
said
they
would
said
edward
not
at
all
sure
what
lagging
was
but
sure
that
it
was
something
dreadful
a
letter
and
put
it
in
his
they
find
it
in
the
morning
leave
you
pinned
by
the
hand
all
night

i
think
said
gustus
rather
said
edward
bravely
but
his
voice
was
weak
bear
you
to
be
lagged
gustus
i
do
love
you
so
of
that
said
gustus
sternly
leave
you
the
lamp
i
can
find
my
way
with
matches
keep
up
your
pecker
and
never
say
die
wo
said
edward
bravely
gustus
that
was
how
it
happened
that
edward
father
was
roused
from
slumbers
by
violent
shakings
from
an
unknown
hand
while
an
unknown
voice
uttered
these
surprising
words
is
in
the
gold
and
silver
and
copper
mine
that
we
found
under
your
garden
come
and
get
him
out
when
edward
father
was
at
last
persuaded
that
gustus
was
not
a
silly
dream
and
this
took
some
time
he
got
up
he
did
not
believe
a
word
that
gustus
said
even
when
gustus
added
me
which
he
did
several
times
but
edward
bed
was
empty
his
clothes
gone
edward
father
got
the
gardener
from
next
door
with
at
the
suggestion
of
gustus
a
pick
the
hole
in
the
rockery
was
enlarged
and
they
all
got
in
and
when
they
got
to
the
place
where
edward
was
there
sure
enough
was
edward
pinned
by
the
hand
between
a
piece
of
wood
and
a
piece
of
rock
neither
the
father
nor
the
gardener
noticed
any
metal
edward
had
fainted
they
got
him
out
a
couple
of
strokes
with
the
pick
released
his
hand
but
it
was
bruised
and
bleeding
they
all
turned
to
go
but
they
had
not
gone
twenty
yards
before
there
was
a
crash
and
a
loud
report
like
thunder
and
a
slow
rumbling
rattling
noise
very
dreadful
to
hear
out
of
this
quick
sir
said
the
gardener
roof
fell
in
this
part
of
the
caves
ai
safe
edward
was
very
feverish
and
ill
for
several
days
during
which
he
told
his
father
the
whole
story
of
which
his
father
did
not
believe
a
word
but
he
was
kind
to
gustus
because
gustus
was
evidently
fond
of
edward
when
edward
was
well
enough
to
walk
in
the
garden
his
father
and
he
found
that
a
good
deal
of
the
shrubbery
had
sunk
so
that
the
trees
looked
as
though
they
were
growing
in
a
pit
it
spoiled
the
look
of
the
garden
and
edward
father
decided
to
move
the
trees
to
the
other
side
when
this
was
done
the
first
tree
uprooted
showed
a
dark
hollow
below
it
the
man
is
not
born
who
will
not
examine
and
explore
a
dark
hollow
in
his
own
grounds
so
edward
father
explored
this
is
the
true
story
of
the
discovery
of
that
extraordinary
vein
of
silver
copper
and
gold
which
has
excited
so
much
interest
in
scientific
and
mining
circles
learned
papers
have
been
written
about
it
learned
professors
have
been
rude
to
each
other
about
it
but
no
one
knows
how
it
came
there
except
gustus
and
edward
and
you
and
me
edward
father
is
quite
as
ignorant
as
any
one
else
but
he
is
much
richer
than
most
of
them
and
at
any
rate
he
knows
that
it
was
gustus
who
first
told
him
of
the
and
who
risked
being
lagged
arrested
by
the
police
that
is
rather
than
let
edward
wait
till
morning
with
his
hand
fast
between
wood
and
rock
so
edward
and
gustus
have
been
to
a
good
school
and
now
they
are
at
winchester
and
presently
they
will
be
at
oxford
and
when
gustus
is
he
will
have
half
the
money
that
came
from
the
and
then
he
and
edward
mean
to
start
a
school
of
their
own
and
the
boys
who
are
to
go
to
it
are
to
be
the
sort
of
boys
who
go
to
the
summer
camp
of
the
grand
redoubt
near
the
sea
the
kind
of
boy
that
gustus
was
so
the
will
do
some
good
after
all
though
it
so
unmanageable
to
begin
with
perhaps
it
may
even
be
found
again
but
i
rather
hope
it
wo
it
might
really
have
done
much
more
mischief
than
it
did
and
if
any
one
found
it
it
might
do
more
yet
there
is
no
moral
to
this
story
except
but
no
there
is
no
moral
illustration
quentin
de
ward
iii
accidental
magic
or
do
tell
all
you
know
quentin
de
ward
was
rather
a
nice
little
boy
but
he
had
never
been
with
other
little
boys
and
that
made
him
in
some
ways
a
little
different
from
other
little
boys
his
father
was
in
india
and
he
and
his
mother
lived
in
a
little
house
in
the
new
forest
the
house
it
was
a
cottage
really
but
even
a
cottage
is
a
house
is
it
was
very
pretty
and
thatched
and
had
a
porch
covered
with
honeysuckle
and
ivy
and
white
roses
and
straight
red
hollyhocks
were
trained
to
stand
up
in
a
row
against
the
south
wall
of
it
the
two
lived
quite
alone
and
as
they
had
no
one
else
to
talk
to
they
talked
to
each
other
a
good
deal
de
ward
read
a
great
many
books
and
she
used
to
tell
quentin
about
them
afterwards
they
were
usually
books
about
out
of
the
way
things
for
de
ward
was
interested
in
all
the
things
that
people
are
not
quite
sure
about
the
things
that
are
hidden
and
secret
wonderful
and
mysterious
the
things
people
make
discoveries
about
so
that
when
the
two
were
having
their
tea
on
the
little
brick
terrace
in
front
of
the
hollyhocks
with
the
white
cloth
flapping
in
the
breeze
and
the
wasps
hovering
round
the
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
quentin
to
say
thickly
through
his
bread
and
jam
say
mother
tell
me
some
more
about
atlantis
or
tell
me
some
more
about
ancient
egypt
and
the
little
they
made
for
their
little
boys
or
tell
me
about
the
people
who
think
lord
bacon
wrote
shakespeare
and
his
mother
always
told
him
as
much
as
she
thought
he
could
understand
and
he
always
understood
quite
half
of
what
she
told
him
they
always
talked
the
things
out
thoroughly
and
thus
he
learned
to
be
fond
of
arguing
and
to
enjoy
using
his
brains
just
as
you
enjoy
using
your
muscles
in
the
football
field
or
the
gymnasium
also
he
came
to
know
quite
a
lot
of
odd
out
of
the
way
things
and
to
have
opinions
of
his
own
concerning
the
lost
kingdom
of
atlantis
and
the
man
with
the
iron
mask
the
building
of
stonehenge
the
egyptians
cuneiform
writings
and
assyrian
sculptures
the
mexican
pyramids
and
the
shipping
activities
of
tyre
and
sidon
quentin
did
no
regular
lessons
such
as
most
boys
have
but
he
read
all
sorts
of
books
and
made
notes
from
them
in
a
large
and
straggling
handwriting
you
will
already
have
supposed
that
quentin
was
a
prig
but
he
was
and
you
would
have
owned
this
if
you
had
seen
him
scampering
through
the
greenwood
on
his
quiet
new
forest
pony
or
setting
snares
for
the
rabbits
that
get
into
the
garden
and
eat
the
precious
lettuces
and
parsley
also
he
fished
in
the
little
streams
that
run
through
that
lovely
land
and
shot
with
a
bow
and
arrows
and
he
was
a
very
good
shot
too
besides
this
he
collected
stamps
and
birds
eggs
and
picture
and
kept
and
bantams
and
climbed
trees
and
tore
his
clothes
in
twenty
different
ways
and
once
he
fought
the
grocer
boy
and
got
licked
and
did
cry
and
made
friends
with
the
grocer
boy
afterwards
and
got
him
to
show
him
all
he
knew
about
fighting
so
you
see
he
was
really
not
a
mug
he
was
ten
years
old
and
he
had
enjoyed
every
moment
of
his
ten
years
even
the
sleeping
ones
because
he
always
dreamed
jolly
dreams
though
he
could
not
always
remember
what
they
were
i
tell
you
all
this
so
that
you
may
understand
why
he
said
what
he
did
when
his
mother
broke
the
news
to
him
he
was
sitting
by
the
stream
that
ran
along
the
end
of
the
garden
making
bricks
of
the
clay
that
the
stream
banks
were
made
of
he
dried
them
in
the
sun
and
then
baked
them
under
the
kitchen
stove
it
is
quite
a
good
way
to
make
bricks
you
might
try
it
sometimes
his
mother
came
out
looking
just
as
usual
in
her
pink
cotton
gown
and
her
pink
sunbonnet
and
she
had
a
letter
in
her
hand
boy
of
my
heart
she
said
busy
said
quentin
importantly
not
looking
up
and
going
on
with
his
work
making
stones
to
build
stonehenge
with
you
show
me
how
to
build
it
wo
you
mother
dear
she
said
absently
if
i
can
course
you
can
he
said
can
do
everything
she
sat
down
on
a
tuft
of
grass
near
him
dear
she
said
and
something
in
her
voice
made
him
look
up
suddenly
mother
what
is
it
he
asked
been
wounded
she
said
all
right
now
dear
do
be
frightened
only
i
got
to
go
out
to
him
i
shall
meet
him
in
egypt
and
you
must
go
to
school
in
salisbury
a
very
nice
school
dear
till
i
come
back
i
come
too
he
asked
and
when
he
understood
that
he
could
not
he
went
on
with
the
bricks
in
silence
with
his
mouth
shut
very
tight
after
a
moment
he
said
then
i
shall
see
stonehenge
said
his
mother
pleased
that
he
took
the
news
so
calmly
will
be
sure
to
see
stonehenge
some
time
he
stood
still
looking
down
at
the
little
mould
of
clay
in
his
hand
so
still
that
his
mother
got
up
and
came
close
to
him
she
said
what
is
it
he
leaned
his
head
against
her
wo
make
a
fuss
he
said
you
ca
begin
to
be
brave
the
very
first
minute
or
if
you
do
you
ca
go
on
being
and
with
that
he
began
to
cry
though
he
had
not
cried
after
the
affair
of
the
grocer
boy
the
thought
of
school
was
not
so
terrible
to
quentin
as
de
ward
had
thought
it
would
be
in
fact
he
rather
liked
it
with
half
his
mind
but
the
other
half
did
like
it
because
it
meant
parting
from
his
mother
who
so
far
had
been
his
only
friend
but
it
was
exciting
to
be
taken
to
southampton
and
have
all
sorts
of
new
clothes
bought
for
you
and
a
school
trunk
and
a
little
polished
box
that
locked
up
to
keep
your
money
in
and
your
gold
sleeve
links
and
your
watch
and
chain
when
you
were
not
wearing
them
also
the
journey
to
salisbury
was
made
in
a
motor
which
was
very
exciting
of
course
and
rather
took
quentin
mind
off
the
parting
with
his
mother
as
she
meant
it
should
and
there
was
a
very
grand
lunch
at
the
white
hart
hotel
at
salisbury
and
then
very
suddenly
indeed
it
was
and
the
motor
snorted
and
hooted
and
throbbed
and
rushed
away
and
mother
was
gone
and
quentin
was
at
school
i
believe
it
was
quite
a
nice
school
it
was
in
a
very
nice
house
with
a
large
quiet
garden
and
there
were
only
about
twenty
boys
and
the
masters
were
kind
and
the
boys
no
worse
than
other
boys
of
their
age
but
quentin
hated
it
from
the
very
beginning
for
when
his
mother
had
gone
the
headmaster
said
will
be
out
in
take
a
book
de
ward
and
gave
him
eric
and
his
a
mere
baby
book
it
was
too
silly
he
could
not
read
it
he
saw
on
a
shelf
near
him
a
very
old
friend
of
his
so
he
said
rather
have
this
please
should
say
sir
when
you
speak
to
a
master
the
head
said
to
him
the
book
by
all
means
to
himself
the
head
said
wish
you
joy
of
it
you
little
prig
when
school
was
over
one
of
the
boys
was
told
to
show
quentin
his
bed
and
his
locker
the
matron
had
already
unpacked
his
box
and
his
pile
of
books
was
waiting
for
him
to
carry
it
over
what
a
lot
of
books
said
smithson
minor
this
is
it
a
jolly
story
is
a
story
said
quentin
and
just
then
the
classical
master
came
by
that
about
he
said
a
book
the
new
chap
got
said
smithson
the
classical
master
glanced
at
the
book
how
much
do
you
understand
of
this
he
asked
fluttering
the
leaves
all
i
think
said
quentin
should
say
sir
when
you
speak
to
a
master
said
the
classical
one
and
to
himself
he
added
prig
then
he
said
to
quentin
am
afraid
you
will
find
yourself
rather
out
of
your
element
among
ordinary
boys
do
think
so
said
quentin
calmly
adding
as
an
afterthought
glad
you
so
confident
said
the
classical
master
and
went
word
said
smithson
minor
in
a
rather
awed
voice
did
answer
him
back
course
i
did
said
quentin
answer
when
you
spoken
to
smithson
minor
informed
the
interested
school
that
the
new
chap
was
a
prig
but
he
had
a
cool
cheek
and
that
some
sport
might
be
expected
after
supper
the
boys
had
half
an
hour
recreation
quentin
who
was
tired
picked
up
a
book
which
a
big
boy
had
just
put
down
it
was
the
night
you
kid
said
the
big
boy
pretend
you
read
shakespeare
for
fun
that
simple
swank
you
know
do
know
what
swank
is
said
quentin
i
like
the
whoever
wrote
it
said
quentin
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
its
being
bacon
who
wrote
the
plays
of
course
that
settled
it
from
that
moment
he
was
called
not
de
ward
which
was
strange
enough
but
bacon
he
rather
liked
that
but
the
next
day
it
was
pork
and
the
day
after
pig
and
that
was
unbearable
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
class
for
he
knew
no
latin
as
it
is
taught
in
schools
only
odd
words
that
english
words
come
from
and
some
latin
words
that
are
used
in
science
and
i
can
not
pretend
that
his
arithmetic
was
anything
but
contemptible
the
book
called
had
been
looked
at
by
most
of
the
school
and
smithson
major
not
nearly
such
an
agreeable
boy
as
his
brother
hit
on
a
new
nickname
pork
a
good
name
for
a
swanker
he
said
know
the
rotten
meat
they
have
in
chicago
this
was
in
the
playground
before
dinner
quentin
who
had
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
very
tight
these
days
because
of
course
a
boy
of
ten
can
not
cry
before
other
chaps
shut
the
book
he
was
reading
and
looked
up
wo
be
called
that
he
said
quietly
said
you
would
said
smithson
major
who
after
all
was
only
twelve
say
you
will
you
call
me
that
i
shall
hit
you
said
quentin
hard
as
i
can
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
and
cries
of
old
smithson
smithie
and
leave
the
omnibus
what
should
i
be
doing
while
you
were
hitting
me
asked
smithson
contemptuously
illustration
it
landed
on
the
point
of
the
chin
of
smithson
major
do
know
and
i
do
care
said
quentin
smithson
looked
round
no
master
was
in
sight
it
seemed
an
excellent
opportunity
to
teach
young
de
ward
his
place
he
said
very
deliberately
and
quentin
sprang
at
him
and
instantly
it
was
a
fight
now
quentin
had
only
once
fought
really
fought
before
then
it
was
the
grocer
boy
and
he
had
been
beaten
but
he
had
learned
something
since
and
the
chief
conclusion
he
now
drew
from
his
memories
of
that
fight
was
that
he
had
not
hit
half
hard
enough
an
opinion
almost
universal
among
those
who
have
fought
and
not
won
as
the
fist
of
smithson
major
described
a
half
circle
and
hurt
his
ear
very
much
quentin
suddenly
screwed
himself
up
and
hit
out
with
his
right
hand
straight
and
with
his
whole
weight
behind
the
blow
as
the
grocer
boy
had
shown
him
all
his
grief
for
his
wounded
father
his
sorrow
at
the
parting
from
his
mother
all
his
hatred
of
his
school
and
his
contempt
for
his
schoolfellows
went
into
that
blow
it
landed
on
the
point
of
the
chin
of
smithson
major
who
fell
together
like
a
heap
of
rags
said
quentin
gazing
with
interest
at
his
hand
it
hurt
a
good
deal
but
he
looked
at
it
with
respect
afraid
i
hurt
him
he
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
that
he
was
in
an
enemies
country
and
so
apparently
had
his
enemies
done
piggy
bravo
young
well
hit
by
jove
friendly
hands
thumped
him
on
the
back
smithson
major
was
no
popular
hero
quentin
felt
as
his
schoolfellows
would
have
put
it
bucked
it
is
one
thing
to
be
called
pig
in
enmity
and
derision
another
to
be
called
piggy
an
affectionate
diminutive
after
all
to
the
chorus
of
admiring
smacks
up
smithie
cried
the
ring
any
more
it
appeared
that
smithie
did
not
want
any
more
he
lay
not
moving
at
all
and
very
white
say
the
crowd
temper
veered
killed
him
i
expect
i
would
like
to
be
you
bacon
pig
you
notice
for
aggravation
piggy
in
enthusiastic
applause
in
the
moment
of
possible
tragedy
the
more
formal
bacon
have
said
quentin
very
white
himself
if
i
have
he
began
by
calling
names
smithson
moved
and
grunted
a
sigh
of
relief
swept
the
ring
as
a
breeze
sweeps
a
cornfield
all
right
a
fair
knock
out
piggy
got
the
use
of
do
smithie
good
the
voices
hushed
suddenly
a
master
was
on
the
scene
the
classical
master
he
said
new
boy
who
began
it
did
said
quentin
he
began
with
calling
names
murmured
the
entire
school
and
quentin
who
had
seen
no
reason
for
not
speaking
the
truth
perceived
that
one
should
not
tell
all
one
knows
and
that
once
more
he
stood
alone
in
the
world
will
go
to
your
room
de
ward
said
the
classical
master
bending
over
smithson
who
having
been
silly
still
remained
in
that
condition
the
headmaster
will
consider
your
case
you
will
probably
be
expelled
quentin
went
to
his
room
and
thought
over
his
position
it
seemed
to
be
desperate
how
was
he
to
know
that
the
classical
master
was
even
then
saying
to
the
head
got
something
in
him
prig
or
no
prig
sir
were
quite
right
to
send
him
to
his
room
said
the
head
must
be
maintained
as
ducket
says
but
it
will
do
smithson
major
a
world
of
good
a
boy
who
reads
shakespeare
for
fun
and
has
views
about
atlantis
and
can
knock
out
a
bully
as
well
he
be
a
power
in
the
school
but
we
must
let
him
know
it
that
was
rather
a
pity
because
quentin
furious
at
the
injustice
of
the
whole
thing
smithson
the
aggressor
consoled
with
himself
punished
expulsion
threatened
was
maturing
plans
mother
had
known
what
it
was
like
he
said
to
himself
would
never
have
left
me
here
i
got
the
two
pounds
she
gave
me
i
shall
go
to
the
white
hart
at
salisbury
no
they
find
me
then
i
go
to
lyndhurst
and
write
to
her
it
better
to
run
away
than
to
be
expelled
quentin
durward
would
never
have
waited
to
be
expelled
from
anywhere
of
course
quentin
durward
was
my
hero
hero
it
could
not
be
otherwise
since
his
own
name
was
so
like
that
of
the
scottish
guardsman
now
the
school
in
salisbury
was
a
little
school
for
little
boys
boys
who
were
used
to
schools
and
took
the
rough
with
the
smooth
but
quentin
was
not
used
to
schools
and
he
had
taken
the
rough
very
much
to
heart
so
much
that
he
did
not
mean
to
take
any
more
of
it
his
dinner
was
brought
up
on
a
tray
bread
and
water
he
put
the
bread
in
his
pocket
then
when
he
knew
that
every
one
was
at
dinner
in
the
long
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
just
walked
very
quietly
down
the
stairs
opened
the
side
door
and
marched
out
down
the
garden
path
and
out
at
the
tradesmen
gate
he
knew
better
than
to
shut
either
gate
or
door
he
went
quickly
down
the
street
turned
the
first
corner
he
came
to
so
as
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
school
he
turned
another
corner
went
through
an
archway
and
found
himself
in
an
very
quiet
indeed
only
a
lurcher
dog
wagged
a
sleepy
tail
on
the
hot
quentin
was
just
turning
to
go
back
through
the
arch
for
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
the
yard
when
he
saw
a
big
covered
cart
whose
horse
wore
a
and
looked
as
if
there
was
no
hurry
the
cart
bore
the
name
carrier
lyndhurst
quentin
knew
all
about
lifts
he
had
often
begged
them
and
got
them
now
there
was
no
one
to
ask
but
he
felt
he
could
very
well
explain
later
that
he
had
wanted
a
lift
much
better
than
now
in
fact
when
he
might
be
caught
at
any
moment
by
some
one
from
the
school
he
climbed
up
by
the
shaft
there
were
boxes
and
packages
of
all
sorts
in
the
cart
and
at
the
back
an
empty
crate
with
sacking
over
it
he
got
into
the
crate
pulled
the
sacking
over
himself
and
settled
down
to
eat
his
bread
presently
the
carrier
came
out
and
there
was
talk
slow
talk
after
a
long
while
the
cart
shook
to
the
carrier
heavy
climb
into
it
the
harness
rattled
the
cart
lurched
and
the
wheels
were
loud
and
bumpy
over
the
cobble
stones
of
the
yard
quentin
felt
safe
the
glow
of
anger
was
still
hot
in
him
and
he
was
glad
to
think
how
they
would
look
for
him
all
over
the
town
in
vain
he
lifted
the
sacking
at
one
corner
so
that
he
could
look
out
between
the
canvas
of
the
cart
back
and
side
and
hoped
to
see
the
classical
master
distractedly
looking
for
him
but
the
streets
were
very
sleepy
every
one
in
salisbury
was
having
dinner
or
in
the
case
of
the
affluent
lunch
the
black
horse
seemed
as
sleepy
as
the
streets
and
went
very
slowly
also
it
stopped
very
often
and
wherever
there
were
parcels
to
leave
there
was
slow
long
talkings
to
be
exchanged
i
think
perhaps
quentin
dozed
a
good
deal
under
his
sacks
at
any
rate
it
was
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
he
suddenly
heard
the
carrier
voice
saying
as
the
horse
stopped
with
a
jerk
a
crate
for
you
baddock
returned
empty
and
knew
that
that
crate
was
not
empty
but
full
full
of
boy
go
and
call
joe
said
a
voice
baddock
quentin
supposed
and
slow
feet
stumped
away
over
stones
mr
miles
leisurely
untied
the
tail
of
the
cart
ready
to
let
the
crate
be
taken
out
quentin
spent
a
paralytic
moment
what
could
he
do
and
then
luckily
or
unluckily
a
reckless
motor
tore
past
and
the
black
horse
plunged
and
mr
miles
had
to
go
to
its
head
and
pretty
to
it
for
a
minute
and
in
that
minute
quentin
lifted
the
sacking
and
looked
out
it
was
low
sunset
and
the
street
was
deserted
he
stepped
out
of
the
crate
dropped
to
the
ground
and
slipped
behind
a
stout
and
friendly
that
seemed
to
offer
protective
shelter
joe
came
and
the
crate
was
taken
down
have
seen
nothing
of
that
there
runaway
boy
by
chance
said
a
new
voice
joe
no
doubt
boy
said
mr
miles
away
from
school
salisbury
said
joe
far
and
near
so
they
be
little
varmint
ai
seen
no
boys
not
ordinary
said
mr
miles
as
flies
they
be
here
there
and
everywhere
drat
sixpence
correct
so
long
joe
the
cart
rattled
away
joe
and
the
crate
blundered
out
of
hearing
and
quentin
looked
cautiously
round
the
this
was
an
adventure
but
he
was
cooler
now
than
he
had
been
at
starting
his
hot
anger
had
died
down
he
would
have
been
contented
he
could
not
help
feeling
with
a
less
adventurous
adventure
but
he
was
in
for
it
now
he
felt
as
i
suppose
people
feel
when
they
jump
off
cliffs
with
parachutes
that
return
was
impossible
hastily
turning
his
school
cap
inside
out
the
only
disguise
he
could
think
of
he
emerged
from
the
seclusion
and
into
the
street
trying
to
look
as
if
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
there
he
did
not
know
the
village
it
was
not
lyndhurst
and
of
course
asking
the
way
was
not
to
be
thought
of
there
was
a
piece
of
sacking
lying
on
the
road
it
must
have
dropped
from
the
carrier
cart
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
over
his
shoulders
deeper
disguise
he
said
and
walked
on
he
walked
steadily
for
a
long
long
way
as
it
seemed
and
the
world
got
darker
and
darker
but
he
kept
on
surely
he
must
presently
come
to
some
village
or
some
signpost
anyhow
whatever
happened
he
could
not
go
back
that
was
the
one
certain
thing
the
broad
stretches
of
country
to
right
and
left
held
no
shapes
of
houses
no
glimmer
of
warm
they
were
bare
and
bleak
only
broken
by
circles
of
trees
that
stood
out
like
black
islands
in
the
misty
grey
of
the
twilight
shall
have
to
sleep
behind
a
hedge
he
said
bravely
enough
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
hedges
and
then
quite
suddenly
he
came
upon
it
a
scattered
building
half
transparent
as
it
seemed
showing
black
against
the
last
faint
pink
and
primrose
of
the
sunset
he
stopped
took
a
few
steps
off
the
road
on
short
crisp
turf
that
rose
in
a
gentle
slope
and
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
paces
he
knew
it
stonehenge
stonehenge
he
had
always
wanted
so
desperately
to
see
well
he
saw
it
now
more
or
less
he
stopped
to
think
he
knew
that
stonehenge
stands
all
alone
on
salisbury
plain
he
was
very
tired
his
mother
had
told
him
about
a
girl
in
a
book
who
slept
all
night
on
the
altar
stone
at
stonehenge
so
it
was
a
thing
that
people
did
to
sleep
there
he
was
not
afraid
as
you
or
i
might
have
been
of
that
lonely
desolate
ruin
of
a
temple
of
long
ago
he
was
used
to
the
forest
and
compared
with
the
forest
any
building
is
homelike
there
was
just
enough
light
left
amid
the
stones
of
the
wonderful
broken
circle
to
guide
him
to
its
centre
as
he
went
his
hand
brushed
a
plant
he
caught
at
it
and
a
little
group
of
flowers
came
away
in
his
hand
john
wort
he
said
the
magic
flower
and
he
remembered
that
it
is
only
magic
when
you
pluck
it
on
midsummer
eve
this
midsummer
eve
he
told
himself
and
put
it
in
his
buttonhole
do
know
where
the
altar
stone
is
he
said
that
looks
a
cosy
little
crack
between
those
two
big
stones
he
crept
into
it
and
lay
down
on
a
flat
stone
that
stretched
between
and
under
two
fallen
pillars
the
night
was
soft
and
warm
it
was
midsummer
eve
is
going
till
the
he
told
himself
bother
about
hotels
i
shall
send
her
a
telegram
in
the
morning
and
get
a
carriage
at
the
nearest
stables
and
go
straight
back
to
her
no
she
wo
be
angry
when
she
hears
all
about
it
i
ask
her
to
let
me
go
to
sea
instead
of
to
school
it
much
more
manly
much
more
manly
much
much
more
much
he
was
asleep
and
the
wild
west
wind
that
swept
across
the
plain
spared
the
little
corner
where
he
lay
asleep
curled
up
in
his
sacking
with
the
school
cap
doubled
twice
for
pillow
he
fell
asleep
on
the
smooth
solid
steady
stone
he
awoke
on
the
stone
in
a
world
that
rocked
as
rock
on
a
choppy
sea
he
went
to
sleep
between
fallen
moveless
pillars
of
a
ruin
older
than
any
world
that
history
knows
he
awoke
in
the
shade
of
a
purple
awning
through
which
strong
sunlight
filtered
and
purple
curtains
that
flapped
and
strained
in
the
wind
and
there
was
a
smell
a
sweet
familiar
smell
of
tarred
ropes
and
the
sea
say
said
quentin
to
himself
a
rum
go
he
had
learned
that
expression
in
a
school
in
salisbury
a
long
time
ago
as
it
seemed
the
stone
on
which
he
lay
dipped
and
rose
to
a
rhythm
which
he
knew
well
enough
he
had
felt
it
when
he
and
his
mother
went
in
a
little
boat
from
keyhaven
to
alum
bay
in
the
isle
of
wight
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
he
was
on
a
ship
but
how
but
why
who
could
have
carried
him
all
that
way
without
waking
him
was
it
magic
accidental
magic
the
john
wort
perhaps
and
the
stone
it
was
not
the
same
it
was
new
clean
cut
and
where
the
wind
displaced
a
corner
of
the
curtain
dazzlingly
white
in
the
sunlight
there
was
the
pat
pat
of
bare
feet
on
the
deck
a
dull
sort
of
shuffling
as
though
people
were
arranging
themselves
and
then
people
outside
the
awning
began
to
sing
it
was
a
strange
song
not
at
all
like
any
music
you
or
i
have
ever
heard
it
had
no
tune
no
more
tune
than
a
drum
has
or
a
trumpet
but
it
had
a
sort
of
wild
rough
glorious
exciting
splendour
about
it
and
gave
you
the
sort
of
intense
feeling
that
drums
and
trumpets
give
quentin
lifted
a
corner
of
the
purple
curtain
and
looked
out
instantly
the
song
stopped
drowned
in
the
deepest
silence
quentin
had
ever
imagined
it
was
only
broken
by
the
of
the
sheets
against
the
masts
of
the
ship
for
it
was
a
ship
quentin
saw
that
as
the
bulwark
dipped
to
show
him
an
unending
waste
of
sea
broken
by
bigger
waves
than
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
he
saw
also
a
crowd
of
men
dressed
in
white
and
blue
and
purple
and
gold
their
right
arms
were
raised
towards
the
sun
half
of
whose
face
showed
across
the
sea
but
they
seemed
to
be
as
my
old
nurse
used
to
say
so
for
their
eyes
were
not
fixed
on
the
sun
but
on
quentin
and
not
in
anger
he
noticed
curiously
but
with
surprise
and
could
it
be
that
they
were
afraid
of
him
illustration
are
you
he
said
i
adjure
you
by
the
sacred
tau
quentin
was
shivering
with
the
surprise
and
newness
of
it
all
he
had
read
about
magic
but
he
had
not
wholly
believed
in
it
and
yet
now
if
this
was
not
magic
what
was
it
you
go
to
sleep
on
an
old
stone
in
a
ruin
you
wake
on
the
same
stone
quite
new
on
a
ship
magic
magic
if
ever
there
was
magic
in
this
wonderful
mysterious
world
the
silence
became
awkward
some
one
had
to
say
something
said
quentin
feeling
that
he
ought
perhaps
to
be
the
one
instantly
every
one
in
sight
fell
on
his
face
on
the
deck
only
one
a
tall
man
with
a
black
beard
and
a
blue
mantle
stood
up
and
looked
quentin
in
the
eyes
are
you
he
said
i
adjure
you
by
the
sacred
tau
now
this
was
very
odd
and
quentin
could
never
understand
it
but
when
this
man
spoke
quentin
understood
perfectly
and
yet
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
the
man
was
speaking
a
foreign
language
so
that
his
thought
was
not
you
speak
english
but
i
can
understand
your
language
am
quentin
de
ward
he
said
name
from
other
stars
how
came
you
here
asked
the
man
do
know
said
quentin
does
not
know
he
did
not
sail
with
us
it
is
by
magic
that
he
is
here
said
blue
mantle
all
and
greet
the
chosen
of
the
gods
they
rose
from
the
deck
and
quentin
saw
that
they
were
all
bearded
men
with
bright
earnest
eyes
dressed
in
strange
dress
of
something
like
jersey
and
tunic
and
heavy
golden
ornaments
chosen
of
the
gods
cried
blue
mantle
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
chosen
of
the
gods
echoed
the
rest
you
very
much
i
sure
said
quentin
what
is
this
stone
asked
blue
mantle
pointing
to
the
stone
on
which
quentin
sat
and
quentin
anxious
to
show
off
his
knowledge
said
not
quite
sure
but
i
it
the
altar
stone
of
stonehenge
is
proved
said
blue
mantle
art
the
chosen
of
the
gods
is
there
anything
my
lord
needs
he
added
humbly
i
rather
hungry
said
quentin
a
long
time
since
dinner
you
know
they
brought
him
bread
and
bananas
and
oranges
said
blue
mantle
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
specially
of
this
which
gives
drink
and
meat
and
ointment
to
man
suddenly
offering
a
large
quentin
took
with
appropriate
you
and
very
kind
said
blue
mantle
too
good
for
the
chosen
of
the
gods
all
that
we
have
is
yours
to
the
very
last
day
of
your
life
you
have
only
to
command
and
we
obey
you
will
like
to
eat
in
seclusion
and
afterwards
you
will
let
us
behold
the
whole
person
of
the
chosen
of
the
gods
quentin
retired
into
the
purple
tent
with
the
fruits
and
the
as
you
know
a
is
not
handy
to
get
at
the
inside
of
at
the
best
of
times
so
quentin
set
that
aside
meaning
to
ask
blue
mantle
later
on
for
a
gimlet
and
a
hammer
when
he
had
had
enough
to
eat
he
peeped
out
again
blue
mantle
was
on
the
watch
and
came
quickly
forward
said
he
very
crossly
indeed
me
how
you
got
here
this
chosen
of
the
gods
business
is
all
very
well
for
the
vulgar
but
you
and
i
know
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
magic
for
yourself
said
quentin
i
not
here
by
magic
i
not
here
at
all
you
are
said
blue
mantle
know
i
am
said
quentin
if
i
not
here
by
magic
what
am
i
here
by
said
blue
mantle
you
think
that
why
do
you
treat
me
as
a
stowaway
of
public
opinion
said
blue
mantle
rubbing
his
nose
in
an
angry
sort
of
perplexedness
well
said
quentin
who
was
feeling
so
surprised
and
bewildered
that
it
was
a
real
relief
to
him
to
bully
somebody
look
here
i
came
here
by
magic
accidental
magic
i
belong
to
quite
a
different
world
from
yours
but
perhaps
you
are
right
about
my
being
the
chosen
of
the
gods
and
i
tell
you
anything
about
my
world
but
i
command
you
by
the
sacred
tau
he
had
been
quick
enough
to
catch
and
remember
the
word
tell
me
who
you
are
and
where
you
come
from
and
where
you
are
going
blue
mantle
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
he
said
you
invoke
the
sacred
names
of
power
but
i
do
call
it
fair
play
especially
as
you
know
perfectly
well
and
just
want
to
browbeat
me
into
telling
lies
i
shall
not
tell
lies
i
shall
tell
you
the
truth
hoped
you
would
said
quentin
gently
then
said
blue
mantle
am
a
priest
of
poseidon
and
i
come
from
the
great
and
immortal
kingdom
of
atlantis
the
temple
where
the
gold
statue
is
with
the
twelve
in
gold
quentin
asked
eagerly
i
knew
you
knew
all
about
it
said
blue
mantle
i
do
need
to
tell
you
that
i
am
taking
the
sacred
stone
on
which
you
are
sitting
profanely
if
you
are
a
mere
stowaway
and
not
the
chosen
of
the
gods
to
complete
the
splendid
structure
of
a
temple
built
on
a
great
plain
in
the
second
of
the
islands
which
are
our
colonies
in
the
north
east
me
all
about
atlantis
said
quentin
and
the
priest
protesting
that
quentin
knew
as
much
about
it
as
he
did
told
and
all
the
time
the
ship
was
ploughing
through
the
waves
sometimes
sailing
sometimes
rowed
by
hidden
rowers
with
long
oars
and
quentin
was
served
in
all
things
as
though
he
had
been
a
king
if
he
had
insisted
that
he
was
not
the
chosen
of
the
gods
everything
might
have
been
different
but
he
did
not
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
show
how
much
he
knew
about
atlantis
and
sometimes
he
was
wrong
the
priest
said
but
much
more
often
he
was
right
are
less
than
three
days
journey
now
from
the
eastern
isles
blue
mantle
said
one
day
i
warn
you
that
if
you
are
a
mere
stowaway
you
had
better
own
it
because
if
you
persist
in
calling
yourself
the
chosen
of
the
gods
you
will
be
expected
to
act
as
such
to
the
very
end
do
call
myself
anything
said
quentin
i
am
not
a
stowaway
anyhow
and
i
do
know
how
i
came
here
so
of
course
it
was
magic
it
simply
silly
your
being
so
cross
ca
help
being
here
let
be
friends
said
blue
mantle
much
less
crossly
never
believed
in
magic
though
i
a
priest
but
if
it
is
it
is
we
may
as
well
be
friends
as
you
call
it
it
is
for
very
long
anyway
he
added
mysteriously
illustration
the
cart
was
drawn
by
an
enormous
creature
more
like
an
elephant
than
anything
else
and
then
to
show
his
friendliness
he
took
quentin
all
over
the
ship
and
explained
it
all
to
him
and
quentin
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
though
every
now
and
then
he
had
to
pinch
himself
to
make
sure
that
he
was
awake
and
he
was
fed
well
all
the
time
and
all
the
time
made
much
of
so
that
when
the
ship
reached
land
he
was
quite
sorry
the
ship
anchored
by
a
stone
quay
most
solid
and
serviceable
and
every
one
was
very
busy
quentin
kept
out
of
sight
behind
the
purple
curtains
the
sailors
and
the
priests
and
the
priests
attendants
and
everybody
on
the
boat
had
asked
him
so
many
questions
and
been
so
curious
about
his
clothes
that
he
was
not
anxious
to
hear
any
more
questions
asked
or
to
have
to
invent
answers
to
them
and
after
a
very
great
deal
of
talk
almost
as
much
as
mr
carrying
had
needed
the
altar
stone
was
lifted
quentin
curtains
awning
and
all
and
carried
along
a
gangway
to
the
shore
and
there
it
was
put
on
a
sort
of
cart
more
like
what
people
in
manchester
call
a
lurry
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
the
wheels
were
made
of
solid
circles
of
wood
bound
round
with
copper
and
the
cart
was
drawn
by
not
horses
or
donkeys
or
oxen
or
even
dogs
but
by
an
enormous
creature
more
like
an
elephant
than
anything
else
only
it
had
long
hair
rather
like
the
hair
worn
by
goats
you
perhaps
would
not
have
known
what
this
vast
creature
was
but
quentin
who
had
all
sorts
of
information
packed
in
his
head
knew
at
once
that
it
was
a
mammoth
and
by
that
he
knew
too
that
he
had
slipped
back
many
thousands
of
years
because
of
course
it
is
a
very
long
time
indeed
since
there
were
any
mammoths
alive
and
able
to
draw
lurries
and
the
car
and
the
priest
and
the
priest
retinue
and
the
stone
and
quentin
and
the
mammoth
journeyed
slowly
away
from
the
coast
passing
through
great
green
forests
and
among
strange
gray
mountains
where
were
they
journeying
quentin
asked
the
same
question
you
may
be
sure
and
blue
mantle
told
him
stonehenge
and
quentin
understood
him
perfectly
though
stonehenge
was
not
the
word
blue
mantle
used
or
anything
like
it
great
temple
is
now
complete
he
said
but
the
altar
stone
it
will
be
the
most
wonderful
temple
ever
built
in
any
of
the
colonies
of
atlantis
and
it
will
be
consecrated
on
the
longest
day
of
the
year
day
said
quentin
thoughtlessly
and
as
usual
anxious
to
tell
all
he
knew
know
the
sun
strikes
through
the
arch
on
to
the
altar
stone
at
sunrise
hundreds
of
people
go
to
see
it
the
ruins
are
quite
crowded
sometimes
i
believe
said
the
priest
in
a
terrible
voice
ruins
mean
said
quentin
hastily
sun
will
still
shine
the
same
way
even
when
the
temple
is
in
ruins
wo
it
temple
said
the
priest
built
to
defy
time
it
will
never
be
in
ruins
all
know
said
quentin
not
very
politely
is
not
by
any
means
all
i
know
said
the
priest
do
not
tell
all
i
know
nor
do
you
used
to
said
quentin
i
any
more
it
only
leads
to
trouble
i
see
that
now
now
though
quentin
had
been
intensely
interested
in
everything
he
had
seen
in
the
ship
and
on
the
journey
you
may
be
sure
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
need
there
was
to
get
back
out
of
this
time
of
atlantis
into
his
own
time
he
knew
that
he
must
have
got
into
these
atlantean
times
by
some
very
simple
accidental
magic
and
he
felt
no
doubt
that
he
should
get
back
in
the
same
way
he
felt
almost
sure
that
the
so
to
speak
of
the
magic
would
begin
when
the
stone
got
back
to
the
place
where
it
had
lain
for
so
many
thousand
years
before
he
happened
to
go
to
sleep
on
it
and
to
start
perhaps
by
the
wort
the
accidental
magic
if
only
when
he
got
back
there
he
could
think
of
the
compelling
the
magic
word
and
now
the
slow
procession
wound
over
the
downs
and
far
away
across
the
plain
which
was
almost
just
the
same
then
as
it
is
now
quentin
saw
what
he
knew
must
be
stonehenge
but
it
was
no
longer
the
grey
pile
of
ruins
that
you
have
perhaps
seen
or
have
at
any
rate
seen
pictures
of
from
afar
one
could
see
the
gleam
of
yellow
gold
and
red
copper
the
flutter
of
purple
curtains
the
glitter
and
dazzle
of
shimmering
silver
as
they
drew
near
to
the
spot
quentin
perceived
that
the
great
stones
he
remembered
were
overlaid
with
ornamental
work
with
vivid
paintings
the
whole
thing
was
a
great
circular
building
every
stone
in
its
place
at
a
mile
or
two
distant
lay
a
town
and
in
that
town
with
every
possible
luxury
served
with
every
circumstance
of
servile
homage
quentin
ate
and
slept
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
what
that
town
was
like
where
he
slept
and
ate
but
i
have
not
you
can
read
for
yourself
some
day
what
atlantis
was
like
plato
tells
us
a
good
deal
and
the
colonies
of
atlantis
must
have
had
at
least
a
reasonable
copy
of
the
cities
of
that
fair
and
lovely
land
that
night
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
first
gone
to
sleep
on
the
altar
stone
quentin
slept
apart
from
it
he
lay
on
a
wooden
couch
strewn
with
soft
and
a
woollen
coverlet
was
laid
over
him
and
he
slept
soundly
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
it
seemed
blue
mantle
woke
him
he
said
of
the
gods
since
you
be
that
and
no
stowaway
the
hour
draws
nigh
the
mammoth
was
waiting
quentin
and
blue
mantle
rode
on
its
back
to
the
outer
porch
of
the
new
temple
of
stonehenge
rows
of
priests
and
attendants
robed
in
white
and
blue
and
purple
formed
a
sort
of
avenue
up
which
blue
mantle
led
the
chosen
of
the
gods
who
was
quentin
they
took
off
his
jacket
and
put
a
white
dress
on
him
rather
like
a
without
sleeves
and
they
put
a
thick
wreath
of
london
pride
on
his
head
and
another
larger
and
longer
round
his
neck
only
the
chaps
at
school
could
see
me
now
he
said
to
himself
proudly
and
by
this
time
it
was
gray
dawn
down
now
said
blue
mantle
down
o
beloved
of
the
gods
upon
the
altar
stone
for
the
last
time
shall
be
able
to
go
then
quentin
asked
this
accidental
magic
was
he
perceived
a
tricky
thing
and
he
wanted
to
be
sure
will
not
be
able
to
stay
said
the
priest
going
is
what
you
desire
the
desire
of
the
chosen
of
the
gods
is
fully
granted
the
grass
on
the
plain
far
and
near
rustled
with
the
tread
of
many
feet
the
cold
air
of
dawn
thrilled
to
the
awed
murmured
of
many
voices
quentin
lay
down
with
his
pink
wreaths
and
his
white
robe
and
watched
the
quickening
pinkiness
of
the
east
and
slowly
the
great
circle
of
the
temple
filled
with
folk
all
carrying
in
their
hands
the
faint
pinkiness
of
the
flowers
which
we
nowadays
call
london
pride
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
arch
through
which
at
sunrise
on
midsummer
day
the
sun
first
beam
should
fall
upon
the
white
new
clean
altar
stone
the
stone
is
still
there
after
all
these
thousands
of
years
and
at
sunrise
on
midsummer
day
the
sun
first
ray
still
falls
on
it
illustration
cried
the
priest
of
the
immortals
close
your
eyes
the
sky
grew
lighter
and
lighter
and
at
last
the
sun
peered
redly
over
the
down
and
the
first
ray
of
the
morning
sunlight
fell
full
on
the
altar
stone
and
on
the
face
of
quentin
and
as
it
did
so
a
very
tall
priest
with
a
apron
and
a
curious
winged
stepped
forward
he
carried
a
great
bronze
knife
and
he
waved
it
ten
times
in
the
shaft
of
sunlight
that
shot
through
the
arch
and
on
to
the
altar
stone
he
cried
do
i
bathe
the
sacred
blade
in
the
pure
fountain
of
all
light
all
wisdom
all
splendour
in
the
name
of
the
ten
kings
the
ten
virtues
the
ten
hopes
the
ten
fears
i
make
my
weapon
clean
may
this
temple
of
our
love
and
our
desire
endure
for
ever
so
long
as
the
glory
of
our
lord
the
sun
is
shed
upon
this
earth
may
the
sacrifice
i
now
humbly
and
proudly
offer
be
acceptable
to
the
gods
by
whom
it
has
been
so
miraculously
provided
chosen
of
the
gods
return
to
the
gods
who
sent
thee
a
roar
of
voices
rang
through
the
temple
the
bronze
knife
was
raised
over
quentin
he
could
not
believe
that
this
this
horror
was
the
end
of
all
these
wonderful
happenings
no
he
cried
not
true
i
not
the
chosen
of
the
gods
only
a
little
boy
that
got
here
by
accidental
magic
cried
the
priest
of
the
immortals
close
your
eyes
it
will
not
hurt
this
life
is
only
a
dream
the
other
life
is
the
real
life
be
strong
be
brave
quentin
was
not
brave
but
he
shut
his
eyes
he
could
not
help
it
the
glitter
of
the
bronze
knife
in
the
sunlight
was
too
strong
for
him
he
could
not
believe
that
this
could
really
have
happened
to
him
every
one
had
been
so
kind
so
friendly
to
him
and
it
was
all
for
this
suddenly
a
sharp
touch
at
his
side
told
him
that
for
this
indeed
it
had
all
been
he
felt
the
point
of
the
knife
he
cried
and
opened
his
eyes
again
he
always
felt
quite
sure
afterwards
that
was
the
the
spell
of
spells
for
when
he
opened
his
eyes
there
was
no
priest
no
worshippers
no
splendour
of
colour
and
metal
no
chosen
of
the
gods
no
knife
only
a
little
boy
with
a
piece
of
sacking
over
him
damp
with
the
night
dews
lying
on
a
stone
amid
the
grey
ruins
of
stonehenge
and
all
about
him
a
crowd
of
tourists
who
had
come
to
see
the
sun
first
shaft
strike
the
altar
of
stonehenge
on
midsummer
day
in
the
morning
and
instead
of
a
knife
point
at
his
side
there
was
only
the
ferrule
of
the
umbrella
of
an
elderly
and
retired
tea
merchant
in
a
mackintosh
and
an
alpine
hat
a
ferrule
which
had
prodded
the
sleeping
boy
so
unexpectedly
surprised
on
the
very
altar
stone
where
the
sun
ray
now
lingered
and
then
in
a
moment
he
knew
that
he
had
not
uttered
the
spell
in
vain
the
word
of
compelling
the
word
of
power
for
his
mother
was
there
kneeling
beside
him
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
cried
as
he
clung
to
her
can
not
all
of
us
be
brave
always
the
tourists
were
very
kind
and
interested
and
the
tea
merchant
insisted
on
giving
quentin
something
out
of
a
flask
which
was
so
nasty
that
quentin
only
pretended
to
drink
out
of
politeness
his
mother
had
a
carriage
waiting
and
they
escaped
to
it
while
the
tourists
were
saying
romantic
and
asking
each
other
whatever
in
the
world
had
happened
how
you
come
to
be
there
darling
said
his
mother
with
warm
hands
comfortingly
round
him
been
looking
for
you
all
night
i
went
to
say
to
you
yesterday
oh
quentin
and
i
found
run
away
how
you
sorry
said
quentin
it
worried
you
i
sorry
very
very
i
was
going
to
telegraph
where
have
you
been
what
have
you
been
doing
all
night
she
asked
caressing
him
it
only
one
night
said
quentin
do
know
exactly
happened
it
was
accidental
magic
i
think
mother
i
glad
i
thought
of
the
right
word
to
get
back
though
and
then
he
told
her
all
about
it
she
held
him
very
tightly
and
let
him
talk
perhaps
she
thought
that
a
little
boy
to
whom
accidental
magic
happened
all
in
a
minute
like
that
was
not
exactly
the
right
little
boy
for
that
excellent
school
in
salisbury
anyhow
she
took
him
to
egypt
with
her
to
meet
his
father
and
on
the
way
they
happened
to
see
a
doctor
in
london
who
said
which
is
a
poor
name
for
accidental
magic
and
quentin
does
not
believe
it
means
the
same
thing
at
all
quentin
father
is
well
now
and
he
has
left
the
army
and
father
and
mother
and
quentin
live
in
a
jolly
little
old
house
in
salisbury
and
quentin
is
a
boy
at
that
very
same
school
he
and
smithson
minor
are
the
greatest
of
friends
but
he
has
never
told
smithson
minor
about
the
accidental
magic
he
has
learned
now
and
learned
very
thoroughly
that
it
is
not
always
wise
to
tell
all
you
know
if
he
had
not
owned
that
he
knew
that
it
was
the
stonehenge
altar
stone
you
may
think
that
the
accidental
magic
was
all
a
dream
and
that
quentin
dreamed
it
because
his
mother
had
told
him
so
much
about
atlantis
but
then
how
do
you
account
for
his
dreaming
so
much
that
his
mother
had
never
told
him
you
think
that
that
part
was
true
well
it
may
have
been
true
for
anything
i
know
and
i
am
sure
you
do
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
iv
the
princess
and
the
i
do
see
what
we
to
said
the
queen
for
the
twentieth
time
we
do
will
end
in
misfortune
said
the
king
gloomily
see
it
will
they
were
sitting
in
the
honeysuckle
arbour
talking
things
over
while
the
nurse
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
with
the
new
baby
in
her
arms
dear
said
the
poor
queen
not
the
slightest
doubt
i
shall
misfortune
comes
in
many
ways
and
you
ca
always
know
beforehand
that
a
certain
way
is
the
way
misfortune
will
come
by
but
there
are
things
misfortune
comes
after
as
surely
as
night
comes
after
day
for
instance
if
you
let
all
the
water
boil
away
the
kettle
will
have
a
hole
burnt
in
it
if
you
leave
the
bath
taps
running
and
the
closed
the
stairs
of
your
house
will
sooner
or
later
resemble
niagara
if
you
leave
your
purse
at
home
you
wo
have
it
with
you
when
you
want
to
pay
your
and
if
you
throw
lighted
wax
matches
at
your
muslin
curtains
your
parent
will
most
likely
have
to
pay
five
pounds
to
the
fire
engines
for
coming
round
and
blowing
the
fire
out
with
a
wet
hose
also
if
you
are
a
king
and
do
not
invite
the
wicked
fairy
to
your
christening
parties
she
will
come
all
the
same
and
if
you
do
ask
the
wicked
fairy
she
will
come
and
in
either
case
it
will
be
the
worse
for
the
new
princess
so
what
is
a
poor
monarch
to
do
of
course
there
is
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
that
is
not
to
have
a
christening
party
at
all
but
this
offends
all
the
good
fairies
and
then
where
are
you
all
these
reflections
had
presented
themselves
to
the
minds
of
king
ozymandias
and
his
queen
and
neither
of
them
could
deny
that
they
were
in
a
most
awkward
situation
they
were
it
over
for
the
hundredth
time
on
the
palace
terrace
where
the
pomegranates
and
oleanders
grew
in
green
tubs
and
the
marble
balustrade
is
overgrown
with
roses
red
and
white
and
pink
and
yellow
on
the
lower
terrace
the
royal
nurse
was
walking
up
and
down
with
the
baby
princess
that
all
the
fuss
was
about
the
queen
eyes
followed
the
baby
admiringly
darling
she
said
ozymandias
do
you
sometimes
wish
been
poor
people
said
the
king
decidedly
i
do
said
the
queen
we
could
have
had
just
you
and
me
and
your
sister
at
the
christening
and
no
fear
of
oh
i
thought
of
something
the
king
patient
expression
showed
that
he
did
not
think
it
likely
that
she
would
have
thought
of
anything
useful
but
at
the
first
five
words
his
expression
changed
you
would
have
said
that
he
pricked
up
his
ears
if
kings
had
ears
that
could
be
pricked
up
what
she
said
was
have
a
secret
christening
asked
the
king
the
queen
was
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
baby
with
what
is
called
a
away
look
in
her
eyes
a
minute
she
said
slowly
see
it
all
yes
we
have
the
party
in
the
cellars
you
know
they
splendid
had
them
built
by
lancashire
men
yes
interrupted
the
king
illustration
on
the
lower
terrace
the
royal
nurse
was
walking
up
and
down
with
the
baby
princess
that
all
the
fuss
was
about
send
out
the
invitations
to
look
like
bills
the
baker
boy
can
take
them
he
a
very
nice
boy
he
made
baby
laugh
yesterday
when
i
was
explaining
to
him
about
the
standard
bread
we
just
put
loaf
a
remittance
at
your
earliest
convenience
will
oblige
that
mean
that
person
is
invited
for
and
on
the
back
we
write
where
and
why
in
invisible
ink
lemon
juice
you
know
and
the
baker
boy
shall
be
told
to
ask
to
see
the
people
just
as
they
do
when
they
mean
earliest
convenience
and
then
he
shall
just
whisper
deadly
secret
lemon
juice
hold
it
to
the
fire
and
come
away
oh
dearest
do
say
you
approve
the
king
laid
down
his
pipe
set
his
crown
straight
and
kissed
the
queen
with
great
and
serious
earnestness
are
a
wonder
he
said
is
the
very
thing
but
the
baker
boy
is
very
small
can
we
trust
him
is
nine
said
the
queen
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
he
must
be
a
prince
in
disguise
he
is
so
very
intelligent
the
queen
plan
was
carried
out
the
cellars
which
were
really
extraordinarily
fine
were
secretly
decorated
by
the
king
confidential
man
and
the
queen
confidential
maid
and
a
few
of
confidential
friends
whom
they
knew
they
could
really
trust
you
would
never
have
thought
they
were
cellars
when
the
decorations
were
finished
the
walls
were
hung
with
white
satin
and
white
velvet
with
wreaths
of
white
roses
and
the
stone
floors
were
covered
with
freshly
cut
turf
with
white
daisies
brisk
and
neat
growing
in
it
the
invitations
were
duly
delivered
by
the
baker
boy
on
them
was
written
in
plain
blue
ink
royal
bakeries
loaf
an
early
remittance
will
oblige
and
when
the
people
held
the
letter
to
the
fire
as
they
were
whisperingly
instructed
to
do
by
the
baker
boy
they
read
in
a
faint
brown
writing
ozymandias
and
queen
eliza
invite
you
to
the
christening
of
their
daughter
princess
ozyliza
at
three
on
wednesday
in
the
palace
cellars
we
are
obliged
to
be
very
secret
and
careful
because
of
wicked
fairies
so
please
come
disguised
as
a
tradesman
with
a
bill
calling
for
the
last
time
before
it
leaves
your
hands
you
will
understand
by
this
that
the
king
and
queen
were
not
as
well
off
as
they
could
wish
so
that
tradesmen
calling
at
the
palace
with
that
sort
of
message
was
the
last
thing
likely
to
excite
remark
but
as
most
of
the
king
subjects
were
not
very
well
off
either
this
was
merely
a
bond
between
the
king
and
his
people
they
could
sympathise
with
each
other
and
understand
each
other
troubles
in
a
way
impossible
to
most
kings
and
most
nations
you
can
imagine
the
excitement
in
the
families
of
the
people
who
were
invited
to
the
christening
party
and
the
interest
they
felt
in
their
costumes
the
lord
chief
justice
disguised
himself
as
a
shoemaker
he
still
had
his
old
blue
by
him
and
a
and
a
are
very
much
alike
the
dressed
as
a
dog
meat
man
and
wheeled
a
barrow
the
prime
minister
appeared
as
a
tailor
this
required
no
change
of
dress
and
only
a
slight
change
of
expression
and
the
other
courtiers
all
disguised
themselves
perfectly
so
did
the
good
fairies
who
had
of
course
been
invited
first
of
all
benevola
queen
of
the
good
fairies
disguised
herself
as
a
moonbeam
which
can
go
into
any
palace
and
no
questions
asked
serena
the
next
in
command
dressed
as
a
butterfly
and
all
the
other
fairies
had
disguises
equally
pretty
and
tasteful
the
queen
looked
most
kind
and
beautiful
the
king
very
handsome
and
manly
and
all
the
guests
agreed
that
the
new
princess
was
the
most
beautiful
baby
they
had
ever
seen
in
all
their
born
days
everybody
brought
the
most
charming
christening
presents
concealed
beneath
their
disguises
the
fairies
gave
the
usual
gifts
beauty
grace
intelligence
charm
and
so
on
everything
seemed
to
be
going
better
than
well
but
of
course
you
know
it
was
the
lord
high
admiral
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
cook
dress
large
enough
completely
to
cover
his
uniform
a
bit
of
an
epaulette
had
peeped
out
and
the
wicked
fairy
malevola
had
spotted
it
as
he
went
past
her
to
the
palace
back
door
near
which
she
had
been
sitting
disguised
as
a
dog
without
a
collar
hiding
from
the
police
and
enjoying
what
she
took
to
be
the
trouble
the
royal
household
were
having
with
their
tradesmen
malevola
almost
jumped
out
of
her
when
she
saw
the
glitter
of
that
epaulette
she
said
and
sniffed
quite
like
a
dog
must
look
into
this
said
she
and
disguising
herself
as
a
toad
she
crept
unseen
into
the
pipe
by
which
the
copper
emptied
itself
into
the
palace
moat
for
of
course
there
was
a
copper
in
one
of
the
palace
cellars
as
there
always
is
in
cellars
in
the
north
country
now
this
copper
had
been
a
great
trial
to
the
decorators
if
there
is
anything
you
do
like
about
your
house
you
can
either
try
to
conceal
it
or
a
feature
of
it
and
as
concealment
of
the
copper
was
impossible
it
was
decided
to
it
a
feature
by
covering
it
with
green
moss
and
planting
a
tree
in
it
a
little
apple
tree
all
in
bloom
it
had
been
very
much
admired
malevola
hastily
altering
her
disguise
to
that
of
a
mole
dug
her
way
through
the
earth
that
the
copper
was
full
of
got
to
the
top
and
put
out
a
sharp
nose
just
as
benevola
was
saying
in
that
soft
voice
which
malevola
always
thought
so
affected
princess
shall
love
and
be
loved
all
her
life
long
she
shall
said
the
wicked
fairy
assuming
her
own
shape
amid
the
screams
of
the
audience
quiet
you
silly
cuckoo
she
said
to
the
lord
chamberlain
whose
screams
were
specially
piercing
i
give
a
christening
present
too
instantly
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
only
queen
eliza
who
had
caught
up
the
baby
at
malevola
first
word
said
feebly
dear
malevola
and
the
king
said
is
exactly
a
party
do
you
know
quite
informal
just
a
few
friends
dropped
in
eh
what
i
perceive
said
malevola
laughing
that
dreadful
laugh
of
hers
which
makes
other
people
feel
as
though
they
would
never
be
able
to
laugh
any
more
i
dropped
in
too
let
have
a
look
at
the
child
the
poor
queen
dared
not
refuse
she
tottered
forward
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
said
malevola
precious
daughter
will
have
beauty
and
grace
and
all
the
rest
of
the
tuppenny
halfpenny
rubbish
those
minxes
have
given
her
but
she
will
be
turned
out
of
her
kingdom
she
will
have
to
face
her
enemies
without
a
single
human
being
to
stand
by
her
and
she
shall
never
come
to
her
own
again
until
she
finds
malevola
hesitated
she
could
not
think
of
anything
sufficiently
unlikely
she
finds
she
repeated
thousand
spears
to
follow
her
to
battle
said
a
new
voice
thousand
spears
devoted
to
her
and
to
her
alone
a
very
young
fairy
fluttered
down
from
the
little
apple
tree
where
she
had
been
hiding
among
the
pink
and
white
blossom
am
very
young
i
know
she
said
apologetically
i
only
just
finished
my
last
course
of
fairy
history
so
i
know
that
if
a
fairy
stops
more
than
half
a
second
in
a
curse
she
ca
go
on
and
some
one
else
may
finish
it
for
her
that
is
so
your
majesty
is
it
she
said
appealing
to
benevola
and
the
queen
of
the
fairies
said
yes
that
was
the
law
only
it
was
such
an
old
one
most
people
had
forgotten
it
think
yourself
very
clever
said
malevola
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
simply
silly
that
the
very
thing
i
provided
against
she
have
any
one
to
stand
by
her
in
battle
so
she
lose
her
kingdom
and
every
one
will
be
killed
and
i
shall
come
to
the
funeral
it
will
be
enormous
she
added
rubbing
her
hands
at
the
joyous
thought
you
quite
finished
said
the
king
politely
if
you
sure
you
wo
take
any
refreshment
may
i
wish
you
a
very
good
afternoon
he
held
the
door
open
himself
and
malevola
went
out
chuckling
the
whole
of
the
party
then
burst
into
tears
mind
said
the
king
at
last
wiping
his
eyes
with
the
tails
of
his
ermine
a
long
way
off
and
perhaps
it
wo
happen
after
all
but
of
course
it
did
the
king
did
what
he
could
to
prepare
his
daughter
for
the
fight
in
which
she
was
to
stand
alone
against
her
enemies
he
had
her
taught
fencing
and
riding
and
shooting
both
with
the
cross
bow
and
the
long
bow
as
well
as
with
pistols
rifles
and
artillery
she
learned
to
dive
and
to
swim
to
run
and
to
jump
to
box
and
to
wrestle
so
that
she
grew
up
as
strong
and
healthy
as
any
young
man
and
could
indeed
have
got
the
best
of
a
fight
with
any
prince
of
her
own
age
but
the
few
princes
who
called
at
the
palace
did
not
come
to
fight
the
princess
and
when
they
heard
that
the
princess
had
no
dowry
except
the
gifts
of
the
fairies
and
also
what
malevola
gift
had
been
they
all
said
they
had
just
looked
in
as
they
were
passing
and
that
they
must
be
going
now
thank
you
and
went
and
then
the
dreadful
thing
happened
the
tradesmen
who
had
for
years
been
calling
for
the
last
time
before
really
decided
to
place
the
matter
in
other
hands
they
called
in
a
neighbouring
king
who
marched
his
army
into
ozymandias
country
conquered
the
army
the
wages
had
been
paid
for
years
turned
out
the
king
and
queen
paid
the
tradesmen
bills
had
most
of
the
palace
walls
papered
with
the
receipts
and
set
up
housekeeping
there
himself
now
when
this
happened
the
princess
was
away
on
a
visit
to
her
aunt
the
empress
of
oricalchia
half
the
world
away
and
there
is
no
regular
post
between
the
two
countries
so
that
when
she
came
home
travelling
with
a
train
of
camels
which
is
rather
slow
work
and
arrived
at
her
own
kingdom
she
expected
to
find
all
the
flags
flying
and
the
bells
ringing
and
the
streets
decked
in
roses
to
welcome
her
home
instead
of
which
nothing
of
the
kind
the
streets
were
all
as
dull
as
dull
the
shops
were
closed
because
it
was
day
and
she
did
not
see
a
single
person
she
knew
she
left
the
camels
laden
with
the
presents
her
aunt
had
given
her
outside
the
gates
and
rode
alone
on
her
own
pet
camel
to
the
palace
wondering
whether
perhaps
her
father
had
not
received
the
letter
she
had
sent
on
ahead
by
carrier
pigeon
the
day
before
and
when
she
got
to
the
palace
and
got
off
her
camel
and
went
in
there
was
a
strange
king
on
her
father
throne
and
a
strange
queen
sat
in
her
mother
place
at
his
side
my
father
said
the
princess
bold
as
brass
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
what
are
you
doing
there
might
ask
you
that
said
the
king
are
you
anyway
am
the
princess
ozyliza
said
she
i
heard
of
you
said
the
king
been
expected
for
some
time
your
father
been
evicted
so
now
you
know
no
i
ca
give
you
his
address
just
then
some
one
came
and
whispered
to
the
queen
that
camels
laden
with
silks
and
velvets
and
monkeys
and
parakeets
and
the
richest
treasures
of
oricalchia
were
outside
the
city
gate
she
put
two
and
two
together
and
whispered
to
the
king
who
nodded
and
said
wish
to
make
a
new
law
every
one
fell
flat
on
his
face
the
law
is
so
much
respected
in
that
country
one
called
ozyliza
is
allowed
to
own
property
in
this
kingdom
said
the
king
out
that
stranger
so
the
princess
was
turned
out
of
her
father
palace
and
went
out
and
cried
in
the
palace
gardens
where
she
had
been
so
happy
when
she
was
little
and
the
baker
boy
who
was
now
the
baker
young
man
came
by
with
the
standard
bread
and
saw
some
one
crying
among
the
oleanders
and
went
to
say
up
to
whoever
it
was
and
it
was
the
princess
he
knew
her
at
once
princess
he
said
up
nothing
is
ever
so
bad
as
it
seems
baker
boy
said
she
for
she
knew
him
too

i
cheer
up
i
am
turned
out
of
my
kingdom
i
have
got
my
father
address
and
i
have
to
face
my
enemies
without
a
single
human
being
to
stand
by
me
illustration
instantly
a
flight
of
winged
arrows
crossed
the
garden
not
true
at
any
rate
said
the
baker
boy
whose
name
was
erinaceus
got
me
if
you
let
me
be
your
squire
i
follow
you
round
the
world
and
help
you
to
fight
your
enemies
wo
be
let
said
the
princess
sadly
i
thank
you
very
much
all
the
same
she
dried
her
eyes
and
stood
up
must
go
she
said
i
nowhere
to
go
to
now
as
soon
as
the
princess
had
been
turned
out
of
the
palace
the
queen
said
much
better
have
beheaded
her
for
treason
and
the
king
said
tell
the
archers
to
pick
her
off
as
she
leaves
the
grounds
so
when
she
stood
up
out
there
among
the
oleanders
some
one
on
the
terrace
cried
she
is
and
instantly
a
flight
of
winged
arrows
crossed
the
garden
at
the
cry
erinaceus
flung
himself
in
front
of
her
clasping
her
in
his
arms
and
turning
his
back
to
the
arrows
the
royal
archers
were
a
thousand
strong
and
all
excellent
shots
erinaceus
felt
a
thousand
arrows
sticking
into
his
back
now
my
last
friend
is
dead
cried
the
princess
but
being
a
very
strong
princess
she
dragged
him
into
the
shrubbery
out
of
sight
of
the
palace
and
then
dragged
him
into
the
wood
and
called
aloud
on
benevola
queen
of
the
fairies
and
benevola
came
killed
my
only
friend
said
the
princess
least
shall
i
pull
out
the
arrows
you
do
said
the
fairy
certainly
bleed
to
death
he
die
if
they
stay
in
said
the
princess
necessarily
said
the
fairy
me
cut
them
a
little
shorter
she
did
with
her
fairy
she
said
do
what
i
can
but
i
afraid
it
be
a
disappointment
to
you
both
erinaceus
she
went
on
addressing
the
unconscious
baker
boy
with
the
stumps
of
the
arrows
still
sticking
in
him
command
you
as
soon
as
i
have
vanished
to
assume
the
form
of
a
the
she
exclaimed
to
the
princess
the
only
nice
person
who
can
live
comfortably
with
a
thousand
spikes
sticking
out
of
him
yes
i
know
there
are
porcupines
but
porcupines
are
vicious
and
and
with
that
she
vanished
so
did
erinaceus
and
the
princess
found
herself
alone
among
the
oleanders
and
on
the
green
turf
was
a
small
and
very
prickly
brown
dear
she
said
i
all
alone
again
and
the
baker
boy
has
given
his
life
for
mine
and
mine
is
worth
having
worth
more
than
all
the
world
said
a
sharp
little
voice
at
her
feet
can
you
talk
she
said
quite
cheered
not
said
the
sturdily
only
the
of
the
i
assumed
i
erinaceus
inside
all
right
enough
pick
me
up
in
a
corner
of
your
mantle
so
as
not
to
prick
your
darling
hands
must
call
names
you
know
said
the
princess
your
ca
excuse
such
liberties
sorry
princess
said
the
i
ca
help
it
only
human
beings

lies
all
other
creatures

the
truth
now

a
tongue
it
wo
speak
anything
but
the
truth
and
the
truth
is
that
i
love
you
more
than
all
the
world
said
the
princess
thoughtfully
you
a
i
suppose
you
may
love
me
and
i
may
love
you
like
pet
dogs
or
dear
little
then
said
the
i
the
baker
boy
in
my
mind
and
soul
my
is
only
pick
me
up
dearest
of
princesses
and
let
us
go
to
seek
our
fortunes
think
it
my
parents
i
ought
to
seek
said
the
princess
she
picked
up
the
in
the
corner
of
her
mantle
and
they
went
away
through
the
wood
they
slept
that
night
at
a
cottage
the
was
very
kind
and
made
a
nice
little
box
of
for
the
to
be
carried
in
and
he
told
the
princess
that
most
of
her
subjects
were
still
loyal
but
that
no
one
could
fight
for
him
because
they
would
be
fighting
for
the
princess
too
and
however
much
they
might
wish
to
do
this
malevola
curse
assured
them
that
it
was
impossible
so
the
princess
put
her
in
its
little
box
and
went
on
looking
everywhere
for
her
father
and
mother
and
after
more
adventures
than
i
have
time
to
tell
you
she
found
them
at
last
living
in
quite
a
poor
way
in
a
villa
at
tooting
they
were
very
glad
to
see
her
but
when
they
heard
that
she
meant
to
try
to
get
back
the
kingdom
the
king
said
should
bother
my
child
i
really
should
we
are
quite
happy
here
i
have
the
pension
always
given
to
deposed
monarchs
and
your
mother
is
becoming
a
really
economical
manager
the
queen
blushed
with
pleasure
and
said
you
dear
but
if
you
should
succeed
in
turning
that
wicked
usurper
out
ozyliza
i
hope
i
shall
be
a
better
queen
than
i
used
to
be
i
am
learning
housekeeping
at
an
evening
class
at
the
institute
the
princess
kissed
her
parents
and
went
out
into
the
garden
to
think
it
over
but
the
garden
was
small
and
quite
full
of
wet
washing
hung
on
lines
so
she
went
into
the
road
but
that
was
full
of
dust
and
perambulators
even
the
wet
washing
was
better
than
that
so
she
went
back
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
in
a
white
alley
of
tablecloths
and
sheets
all
marked
with
a
crown
in
indelible
ink
and
she
took
the
out
of
the
box
it
was
rolled
up
in
a
ball
but
she
stroked
the
little
bit
of
soft
forehead
that
you
can
always
find
if
you
look
carefully
at
a
and
the
uncurled
and
said
am
afraid
i
was
asleep
princess
dear
did
you
want
me
the
only
person
who
knows
all
about
everything
said
she
have
told
father
and
mother
about
the
arrows
now
what
do
you
advise
erinaceus
was
flattered
at
having
his
advice
asked
but
unfortunately
he
had
any
to
give
your
work
princess
he
said
can
only
promise
to
do
anything
a
do
it
not
much
of
course
i
could
die
for
you
but
that
so
useless
said
she
wish
i
were
invisible
he
said
dreamily
where
are
you
cried
ozyliza
for
the
had
vanished
said
a
sharp
little
voice
ca
see
me
but
i
can
see
everything
i
want
to
see
and
i
can
see
what
to
do
i
crawl
into
my
box
and
you
must
disguise
yourself
as
an
old
french
governess
with
the
best
references
and
answer
the
advertisement
that
the
wicked
king
put
yesterday
in
the
usurpers
journal
the
queen
helped
the
princess
to
disguise
herself
which
of
course
the
queen
would
never
have
done
if
she
had
known
about
the
arrows
and
the
king
gave
her
some
of
his
pension
to
buy
a
ticket
with
so
she
went
back
quite
quickly
by
train
to
her
own
kingdom
the
usurping
king
at
once
engaged
the
french
governess
to
teach
his
cook
to
read
french
cookery
books
because
the
best
recipes
are
in
french
of
course
he
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
princess
princess
beneath
the
governessial
disguise
the
french
lessons
were
from
to
in
the
morning
and
from
to
in
the
afternoon
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time
the
governess
could
spend
as
she
liked
she
spent
it
walking
about
the
palace
gardens
and
talking
to
her
invisible
they
talked
about
everything
under
the
sun
and
the
was
the
best
of
company
did
you
become
invisible
she
asked
one
day
and
it
said
suppose
it
was
benevola
doing
only
i
think
every
one
gets
wish
granted
if
they
only
wish
hard
enough
on
the
day
the
said
princess
dear
going
to
begin
to
get
you
back
your
kingdom
and
next
morning
the
king
came
down
to
breakfast
in
a
dreadful
rage
with
his
face
covered
up
in
bandages
palace
is
haunted
he
said
the
middle
of
the
night
a
dreadful
spiked
ball
was
thrown
in
my
face
i
lighted
a
match
there
was
nothing
the
queen
said
you
must
have
been
dreaming
but
next
morning
it
was
her
turn
to
come
down
with
a
bandaged
face
and
the
night
after
the
king
had
the
spiky
ball
thrown
at
him
again
and
then
the
queen
had
it
and
then
they
both
had
it
so
that
they
sleep
at
all
and
had
to
lie
awake
with
nothing
to
think
of
but
their
wickedness
and
every
five
minutes
a
very
little
voice
whispered
stole
the
kingdom
who
killed
the
princess
till
the
king
and
queen
could
have
screamed
with
misery
and
at
last
the
queen
said
need
have
killed
the
princess
and
the
king
said
been
thinking
that
too
and
next
day
the
king
said
do
know
that
we
ought
to
have
taken
this
kingdom
we
had
a
really
kingdom
of
our
own
been
thinking
that
too
said
the
queen
by
this
time
their
hands
and
arms
and
necks
and
faces
and
ears
were
very
sore
indeed
and
they
were
sick
with
want
of
sleep
here
said
the
king
chuck
it
let
write
to
ozymandias
and
tell
him
he
can
take
over
his
kingdom
again
i
had
jolly
well
enough
of
this
said
the
queen
we
ca
bring
the
princess
to
life
again
i
do
wish
we
could
and
she
cried
a
little
through
her
bandages
into
her
egg
for
it
was
breakfast
time
you
mean
that
said
a
little
sharp
voice
though
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
in
the
room
the
king
and
queen
clung
to
each
other
in
terror
upsetting
the
urn
over
the
you
mean
it
said
the
voice
again
yes
or
no
said
the
queen
do
know
who
you
are
but
yes
yes
yes
i
ca
how
we
could
have
been
so
wicked
i
said
the
king
send
for
the
french
governess
said
the
voice
the
bell
dear
said
the
queen
sure
what
it
says
is
right
it
is
the
voice
of
conscience
i
often
heard
it
but
i
never
heard
it
before
the
king
pulled
the
and
ten
magnificent
green
and
gold
footmen
appeared
ask
mademoiselle
to
step
this
way
said
the
queen
the
ten
magnificent
green
and
gold
footmen
found
the
governess
beside
the
marble
basin
feeding
the
and
bowing
their
ten
green
backs
they
gave
the
queen
message
the
governess
who
every
one
agreed
was
always
most
obliging
went
at
once
to
the
pink
satin
where
the
king
and
queen
were
sitting
almost
unrecognisable
in
their
bandages
your
majesties
said
she
curtseying
voice
of
conscience
said
the
queen
us
to
send
for
you
is
there
any
recipe
in
the
french
books
for
bringing
shot
princesses
to
life
if
so
will
you
kindly
translate
it
for
us
is
said
the
princess
thoughtfully
it
is
quite
simple
take
a
king
and
a
queen
and
the
voice
of
conscience
place
them
in
a
clean
pink
with
eggs
coffee
and
toast
add
a
french
governess
the
king
and
queen
must
be
thoroughly
pricked
and
bandaged
and
the
voice
of
conscience
must
be
very
distinct
that
all
asked
the
queen
all
said
the
governess
that
the
king
and
queen
must
have
two
more
bandages
over
their
eyes
and
keep
them
on
till
the
voice
of
conscience
has
counted
very
slowly
you
would
be
so
kind
said
the
queen
to
bandage
us
with
our
table
napkins
only
be
careful
how
you
fold
them
because
our
faces
are
very
sore
and
the
royal
monogram
is
very
stiff
and
hard
owing
to
its
being
embroidered
in
seed
pearls
by
special
command
will
be
very
careful
said
the
governess
kindly
the
moment
the
king
and
queen
were
blindfolded
the
of
conscience
began
two
three
and
ozyliza
tore
off
her
disguise
and
under
the
fussy
alpaca
of
the
french
governess
was
the
simple
slim
dress
of
the
princess
she
stuffed
the
alpaca
up
the
chimney
and
the
grey
wig
into
the
and
had
disposed
of
the
mittens
in
the
and
the
boots
in
the
just
as
the
voice
of
conscience
said
and
stopped
the
king
and
queen
pulled
off
the
bandages
and
there
alive
and
well
with
bright
clear
eyes
and
pinky
cheeks
and
a
mouth
that
smiled
was
the
princess
whom
they
supposed
to
have
been
killed
by
the
thousand
arrows
of
their
thousand
archers
before
they
had
time
to
say
a
word
the
princess
said
morning

had
bad
dreams

a
little
longer
in
my
palace

welcome
i
am
so
sorry

it
said
the
queen
we
want
to
say
we
have
heard
the
voice
of
conscience
and
do
please
forgive
us
another
word
said
the
princess

more

cold
and
the
urn

new
breakfast
and
i
so
sorry
your
faces

so
sore
you
kissed

said
the
voice
which
the
king
and
queen
called
the
voice
of
conscience
faces
would
not
be
sore
any
more
i
said
ozyliza
and
kissed
the
king
ear
and
the
queen
nose
all
she
could
get
at
through
the
bandages
and
instantly
they
were
quite
well
they
had
a
delightful
breakfast
then
the
king
caused
the
royal
household
to
assemble
in
the
and
there
announced
that
as
the
princess
had
come
to
claim
the
kingdom
they
were
returning
to
their
own
kingdom
by
the
train
on
thursday
every
one
cheered
like
mad
and
the
whole
town
was
decorated
and
illuminated
that
evening
flags
flew
from
every
house
and
the
bells
all
rang
just
as
the
princess
had
expected
them
to
do
that
day
when
she
came
home
with
the
camels
all
the
treasure
these
had
carried
was
given
back
to
the
princess
and
the
camels
themselves
were
restored
to
her
hardly
at
all
the
worse
for
wear
the
usurping
king
and
queen
were
seen
off
at
the
station
by
the
princess
and
parted
from
her
with
real
affection
you
see
they
completely
wicked
in
their
hearts
but
they
had
never
had
time
to
think
before
and
being
kept
awake
at
night
forced
them
to
think
and
the
of
conscience
gave
them
something
to
think
about
they
gave
the
princess
the
receipted
bills
with
which
most
of
the
palace
was
papered
in
return
for
board
and
lodging
when
they
were
gone
a
telegram
was
sent
off

ozyliza
and
they
came
immediately
when
they
arrived
the
princess
told
them
the
whole
story
and
they
kissed
and
praised
her
and
called
her
their
deliverer
and
the
saviour
of
her
country
have
done
anything
she
said

erinaceus
who
did
everything

the
fairies

the
king
who

the
best
of
times

get
the
kingdom

till
you
had
a
thousand
spears
devoted
to
you

you
alone

a
thousand
spears
in
my
back
said
a
little
sharp
voice
they
are
all
devoted
to
the
princess
and
to
her
alone
said
the
king
irritably
voice
coming
out
of
nothing
makes
me
jump
ca
get
used
to
it
either
said
the
queen
must
have
a
gold
cage
built
for
the
little
animal
but

must
say
i
wish

was
visible

said
the
princess
earnestly
and
instantly
it
was
i
suppose
the
princess
wished
it
very
hard
for
there
was
the
with
its
long
spiky
body
and
its
little
pointed
face
its
bright
eyes
its
small
round
ears
and
its
sharp
nose
it
looked
at
the
princess
but
it
did
not
speak

erinaceus
princess

her
to

something
nice
for
herself

the
princess

did
know
if

would
have
wished

shape
of
a
dead
man

that
i
have
a
thousand
spears
in
my
back
and
no
man
can
carry

the
princess
burst
into
tears
illustration

kiss
you
on
every
one
of
your
thousand
spears
she
said

you
what
you

ever
she
said
not
fair
i
ca
bear
it
oh

and
there
stood
benevola
before
them
a
little
dazzling
figure
with
blue
butterfly
wings
and
a
wreath
of
moonshine
she
said
you
know
said
the
princess
still
crying
thrown
away
my
and
he
still
a
ca
you
do
ca
said
the
fairy
you
can
your
kisses
are
magic
kisses
do
you
remember
how
you
cured
the
king
and
queen
of
all
the
wounds
the
made
by
rolling
itself
on
to
their
faces
in
the
night
she
ca
go
kissing
said
the
queen
would
be
most
unsuitable
besides
it
would
hurt
her
but
the
raised
its
little
pointed
face
and
the
princess
took
it
up
in
her
hands
she
had
long
since
learned
how
to
do
this
without
hurting
either
herself
or
it
she
looked
in
its
little
bright
eyes
would
kiss
you
on
every
one
of
your
thousand
spears
she
said
give
you
what
you
wish
me
once
it
said
my
fur
is
soft
that
is
all
i
wish
and
enough
to
live
and
die
for
she
stooped
her
head
and
kissed
it
on
its
forehead
where
the
fur
is
soft
just
where
the
prickles
begin
and
instantly
she
was
standing
with
her
hands
on
a
young
man
shoulders
and
her
lips
on
a
young
man
face
just
where
the
hair
begins
and
the
forehead
leaves
off
and
all
round
his
feet
lay
a
pile
of
fallen
arrows
she
drew
back
and
looked
at
him
she
said
different
from
the
baker
boy
i
mean
i
was
an
invisible
he
said
knew
everything
now
i
have
forgotten
all
that
wisdom
save
only
two
things
one
is
that
i
am
a
king
son
i
was
stolen
away
in
infancy
by
an
unprincipled
baker
and
i
am
really
the
son
of
that
usurping
king
whose
face
i
rolled
on
in
the
night
it
is
a
painful
thing
to
roll
on
your
father
face
when
you
are
all
spiky
but
i
did
it
princess
for
your
sake
and
for
my
too
and
now
i
will
go
to
him
and
tell
him
all
and
ask
his
forgiveness
wo
go
away
said
the
princess
do
go
away
what
shall
i
do
without
my
erinaceus
stood
still
looking
very
handsome
and
like
a
prince
is
the
other
thing
that
you
remember
of
your
wisdom
asked
the
queen
curiously
and
erinaceus
answered
not
to
her
but
to
the
princess
other
thing
princess
is
that
i
love
you
there
a
third
thing
erinaceus
said
the
princess
looking
down
is
but
you
must
speak
that
not
i
said
the
princess
a
little
disappointed
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
are
very
wise
little
beasts
said
erinaceus
i
only
knew
that
when
you
told
it
me
told
you
you
kissed
my
little
pointed
face
princess
said
erinaceus
knew
then
goodness
gracious
me
said
the
king
so
said
benevola
i
would
ask
to
the
wedding
you
dear
said
the
queen
as
i
happened
to
be
passing
there
no
time
like
the
present
said
benevola
briskly
you
give
orders
for
the
wedding
bells
to
be
rung
now
at
once
v
septimus
septimusson
the
wind
was
screaming
over
the
marsh
it
shook
the
shutters
and
rattled
the
windows
and
the
little
boy
lay
awake
in
the
bare
attic
his
mother
came
softly
up
the
ladder
stairs
shading
the
flame
of
the
tallow
candle
with
her
hand
not
asleep
mother
said
he
and
she
heard
the
tears
in
his
voice
silly
lad
she
said
sitting
down
on
the
beside
him
and
putting
the
candle
on
the
floor
are
you
crying
for
the
wind
keeps
calling
me
mother
he
said
wo
let
me
alone
it
never
has
since
i
put
up
the
little
for
it
to
play
with
it
keeps
saying
wake
up
septimus
septimusson
wake
up
you
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
you
can
see
the
fairies
and
hear
the
beasts
speak
and
you
must
go
out
and
seek
your
fortune
and
i
afraid
and
i
do
want
to
go
should
think
not
indeed
said
his
mother
wind
does
talk
sep
not
really
you
just
go
to
sleep
like
a
good
boy
and
i
get
father
to
bring
you
a
gingerbread
pig
from
the
fair
but
sep
lay
awake
a
long
time
listening
to
what
the
wind
really
did
keep
on
saying
and
feeling
ashamed
to
think
how
frightened
he
was
of
going
out
all
alone
to
seek
his
fortune
a
thing
all
the
boys
in
books
were
only
too
happy
to
do
next
evening
father
brought
home
the
loveliest
gingerbread
pig
with
currant
eyes
sep
ate
it
and
it
made
him
less
anxious
than
ever
to
go
out
into
the
world
where
perhaps
no
one
would
give
him
gingerbread
pigs
ever
any
more
before
he
went
to
bed
he
ran
down
to
the
shore
where
a
great
new
harbour
was
being
made
the
workmen
had
been
blasting
the
big
rocks
and
on
one
of
the
rocks
a
lot
of
mussels
were
sticking
he
stood
looking
at
them
and
then
suddenly
he
heard
a
lot
of
little
voices
crying
sep
so
frightened
we
choking
the
voices
were
thin
and
sharp
as
the
edges
of
mussel
shells
they
were
indeed
the
voices
of
the
mussels
themselves
dear
said
sep
so
sorry
but
i
ca
move
the
rock
back
into
the
sea
you
know
can
i
now
said
the
mussels
if
you
speak
to
the
wind
you
know
his
language
and
he
very
fond
of
you
since
you
made
that
toy
for
him
he
blow
the
sea
up
till
the
waves
wash
us
back
into
deep
water
i
afraid
of
the
wind
said
sep
says
things
that
frighten
me
very
well
said
the
mussels
do
want
you
to
be
afraid
we
can
die
all
right
if
necessary
then
sep
shivered
and
trembled
away
said
the
thin
sharp
voices
die
but
we
rather
die
in
our
own
brave
company
know
i
a
coward
said
wait
a
minute
wo
wait
said
the
little
voices
ca
speak
to
the
wind
i
wo
said
sep
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
himself
call
out
wind
please
come
and
blow
up
the
waves
to
save
the
poor
mussels
the
wind
answered
with
a
boisterous
shout
right
my
boy
it
shrieked
coming
and
come
it
did
and
when
it
had
attended
to
the
mussels
it
came
and
whispered
to
sep
in
his
attic
and
to
his
great
surprise
instead
of
covering
his
head
with
the
as
usual
and
trying
not
to
listen
he
found
himself
sitting
up
in
bed
and
talking
to
the
wind
man
to
man
he
said
not
afraid
of
you
any
more
course
not
we
friends
now
said
the
wind
because
we
joined
together
to
do
a
kindness
to
some
one
there
nothing
like
that
for
making
people
friends
said
said
the
wind
now
old
chap
when
will
you
go
out
and
seek
your
fortune
remember
how
poor
your
father
is
and
the
fortune
if
you
find
it
wo
be
just
for
you
but
for
your
father
and
mother
and
the
others
said
sep
did
think
of
that
said
the
wind
my
dear
fellow
i
do
hate
to
bother
you
but
it
better
to
fix
a
time
now
when
shall
we
start
said
you
going
with
me
see
you
a
bit
of
the
way
said
the
wind
do
you
say
now
shall
we
start
there
no
time
like
the
present
do
hate
going
said
course
you
do
said
the
wind
cordially
along
get
into
your
things
and
we
make
a
beginning
so
sep
dressed
and
he
wrote
on
his
slate
in
very
big
letters
to
seek
our
fortune
and
he
put
it
on
the
table
so
that
his
mother
should
see
it
when
she
came
down
in
the
morning
and
he
went
out
of
the
cottage
and
the
wind
kindly
shut
the
door
after
him
the
wind
gently
pushed
him
down
to
the
shore
and
there
he
got
into
his
father
boat
which
was
called
the
and
after
his
father
and
mother
and
the
wind
carried
him
across
to
another
country
and
there
he
landed
said
the
wind
clapping
him
on
the
back
you
go
and
good
luck
to
you
and
it
turned
round
and
took
the
boat
home
again
when
sep
mother
found
the
writing
on
the
slate
and
his
father
found
the
boat
gone
they
feared
that
sep
was
drowned
but
when
the
wind
brought
the
boat
back
wrong
way
up
they
were
quite
sure
and
they
both
cried
for
many
a
long
day
the
wind
tried
to
tell
them
that
sep
was
all
right
but
they
understand
and
they
only
said
the
wind
and
fastened
the
shutters
up
tight
and
put
wedges
in
the
windows
sep
walked
along
the
straight
white
road
that
led
across
the
new
country
he
had
no
more
idea
how
to
look
for
fortune
than
you
would
have
if
you
suddenly
left
off
reading
this
and
went
out
of
your
front
door
to
seek
however
he
had
made
a
start
and
that
is
always
something
when
he
had
gone
exactly
seven
miles
on
that
straight
foreign
road
between
strange
trees
and
bordered
with
flowers
he
did
not
know
the
names
of
he
heard
a
groaning
in
the
wood
and
some
one
sighing
and
saying
how
hard
it
is
to
have
to
die
and
never
see
my
wife
and
the
little
cubs
again
the
voice
was
rough
as
a
lion
mane
and
strong
as
a
lion
claws
and
sep
was
very
frightened
but
he
said
not
afraid
and
then
oddly
enough
he
found
he
had
spoken
the
truth
he
was
afraid
he
broke
through
the
bushes
and
found
that
the
person
who
had
spoken
was
indeed
a
lion
a
javelin
had
pierced
its
shoulder
and
fastened
it
to
a
great
tree
right
cried
sep
still
a
minute
sir
he
got
out
his
knife
and
cut
and
cut
at
the
shaft
of
the
javelin
till
he
was
able
to
break
it
off
then
the
lion
drew
back
and
the
broken
shaft
passed
through
the
wound
and
the
broken
javelin
was
left
sticking
in
the
tree
really
extremely
obliged
my
dear
fellow
said
the
lion
warmly
command
me
if
there
any
little
thing
i
can
do
for
you
at
any
time
mention
it
said
sep
with
proper
politeness
to
have
been
of
use
to
you
i
sure
so
they
parted
as
sep
scrambled
through
the
bushes
back
to
the
road
he
kicked
against
an
axe
that
lay
on
the
ground
said
he
poor
woodman
dropped
this
and
not
been
able
to
find
it
i
take
it
along
perhaps
i
may
meet
him
he
was
getting
very
tired
and
very
hungry
and
presently
he
sat
down
to
rest
under
a
and
he
heard
two
little
voices
talking
in
the
branches
voices
soft
as
a
squirrel
fur
and
bright
as
a
squirrel
eyes
they
were
indeed
the
voices
of
two
squirrels
said
one
some
one
below
said
the
other
a
horrid
boy
let
scurry
away
not
a
horrid
boy
said
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
said
squirrel
course
that
makes
all
the
difference
have
some
nuts
said
least
i
mean
yes
if
you
please
so
the
squirrels
brought
nuts
down
to
him
and
when
he
had
eaten
as
many
as
he
wanted
they
filled
his
pockets
and
then
in
return
he
chopped
all
the
lower
boughs
off
the
so
that
boys
who
were
seventh
sons
could
not
climb
up
and
interfere
with
the
housekeeping
arrangements
then
they
parted
the
best
of
friends
and
sep
went
on
have
found
my
fortune
yet
said
he
i
made
a
friend
or
two
and
just
as
he
was
saying
that
he
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
and
met
an
old
gentleman
in
a
coat
riding
a
fine
big
grey
horse
said
the
gentleman
are
you
and
where
are
you
off
to
so
bright
and
early
septimus
septimusson
said
sep
i
going
to
seek
my
fortune

taken
an
axe
to
help
you
carve
your
way
to
glory
said
sep

and
i
suppose

one
lost

so
bringing
it
along
in
case

meet
him
is
it
said
the
old
gentleman
said

it
for
you
said
the
old
gentleman
it
one
that
my
head
forester
lost
yesterday
and
now
come
along
with
me
for
the
boy
i
been
looking
for
for
seven
years
an
honest
boy
and
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
so
sep
went
home
with
the
gentleman
who
was
a
great
lord
in
that
country
and
he
lived
in
that
lord
castle
and
was
taught
everything
that
a
gentleman
ought
to
know
and
in
return
he
told
the
lord
all
about
the
ways
of
birds
and
beasts
for
as
he
understood
their
talk
he
knew
more
about
them
than
any
one
else
in
that
country
and
the
lord
wrote
it
all
down
in
a
book
and
half
the
people
said
it
was
wonderfully
clever
and
the
other
half
said
it
was
nonsense
and
how
could
he
know
this
was
fame
and
the
lord
was
very
pleased
but
though
the
old
lord
was
so
famous
he
would
not
leave
his
castle
for
he
had
a
hump
that
an
enchanter
had
fastened
on
to
him
and
he
could
bear
to
be
seen
with
it
you
get
rid
of
it
for
me
some
day
my
boy
he
used
to
say
one
but
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
and
an
honest
boy
can
do
it
so
all
the
doctors
say
so
sep
grew
up
and
when
he
was
straight
as
a
lance
and
handsome
as
a
picture
the
old
lord
said
to
him
boy
you
been
like
a
son
to
me
but
now
it
time
you
got
married
and
had
sons
of
your
own
is
there
any
girl
you
like
to
marry
said
sep
never
did
care
much
for
girls
the
old
lord
laughed
you
must
set
out
again
and
seek
your
fortune
once
more
he
said
no
man
has
really
found
his
fortune
till
he
found
the
lady
who
is
his
heart
lady
choose
the
best
horse
in
the
stable
and
off
you
go
lad
and
my
blessing
go
with
you
so
sep
chose
a
good
red
horse
and
set
out
and
he
rode
straight
to
the
great
city
that
shone
golden
across
the
plain
and
when
he
got
there
he
found
every
one
crying
whatever
is
the
matter
said
sep
reining
in
the
red
horse
in
front
of
a
smithy
where
the
apprentices
were
crying
on
to
the
fires
and
the
smith
was
dropping
tears
on
the
anvil
the
princess
is
dying
said
the
blacksmith
blowing
his
nose
nasty
wicked
magician
he
had
a
spite
against
the
king
and
he
got
at
the
princess
when
she
was
playing
ball
in
the
garden
and
now
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
and
she
wo
eat
she
die
said
the
first
apprentice
she
such
a
dear
said
the
other
apprentice
sep
sat
still
on
the
red
horse
thinking
anything
been
done
he
asked
yes
said
the
blacksmith
the
doctors
have
seen
her
but
they
ca
do
anything
and
the
king
has
advertised
in
the
usual
way
that
any
one
who
can
cure
her
may
marry
her
but
it
no
good
king
sons
are
what
they
used
to
be
a
silly
lot
they
are
nowadays
all
taken
up
with
football
and
cricket
and
golf
said
sep
you
which
is
the
way
to
the
palace
the
blacksmith
pointed
and
then
burst
into
tears
again
sep
rode
on
when
he
got
to
the
palace
he
asked
to
see
the
king
every
one
there
was
crying
too
from
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
to
the
king
who
was
sitting
upon
his
golden
throne
and
looking
at
his
fine
collection
of
butterflies
through
floods
of
tears
dear
me
yes
young
man
said
the
king
may
her
and
welcome
but
it
no
good
can
but
try
said
sep
so
he
was
taken
to
the
room
where
the
princess
sat
huddled
up
on
her
silver
throne
among
the
white
velvet
cushions
with
her
crown
all
on
one
side
crying
out
of
her
poor
blind
eyes
so
that
the
tears
ran
down
over
her
green
gown
with
the
red
roses
on
it
and
directly
he
saw
her
he
knew
that
she
was
the
only
girl
princess
as
she
was
with
a
crown
and
a
throne
who
could
ever
be
his
heart
lady
he
went
up
to
her
and
kneeled
at
her
side
and
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
the
princess
started
she
could
not
see
or
hear
him
but
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
and
his
lips
she
knew
that
he
was
her
heart
lord
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
cried
more
than
ever
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
stroked
her
hair
till
she
stopped
crying
and
then
he
called
for
bread
and
milk
this
was
brought
in
a
silver
basin
and
he
fed
her
with
it
as
you
feed
a
little
child
the
news
ran
through
the
city
princess
has
eaten
and
all
the
bells
were
set
ringing
sep
said
to
his
princess
and
went
to
bed
in
the
best
bedroom
of
the
palace
early
in
the
grey
morning
he
got
up
and
leaned
out
of
the
open
window
and
called
to
his
old
friend
the
wind
and
the
wind
came
bustling
in
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
crying
my
boy
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
eh
sep
told
him
all
about
the
princess
said
the
wind
not
done
so
badly
at
any
rate
you
got
her
love
and
you
could
have
got
that
with
anybody
help
but
your
own
now
of
course
the
thing
to
do
is
to
find
the
wicked
magician
course
said
i
travel
a
good
deal
i
keep
my
eyes
open
and
let
you
know
if
i
hear
anything
sep
spent
the
day
holding
the
princess
hand
and
feeding
her
at
meal
times
and
that
night
the
wind
rattled
his
window
and
said
me
in
it
came
in
very
noisily
and
said
i
found
your
magician
in
the
forest
pretending
to
be
a
mole
can
i
find
him
said
you
any
friends
in
the
forest
asked
the
wind
then
sep
remembered
his
friends
the
squirrels
and
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
to
the
where
they
lived
they
were
charmed
to
see
him
grown
so
tall
and
strong
and
handsome
and
when
he
had
told
them
his
story
they
said
at
once
yes
delighted
to
be
of
any
service
to
you
and
they
called
to
all
their
little
brothers
and
cousins
and
uncles
and
nephews
to
search
the
forest
for
a
mole
that
was
really
a
mole
and
quite
soon
they
found
him
and
hustled
and
shoved
him
along
till
he
was
face
to
face
with
sep
in
a
green
glade
the
glade
was
green
but
all
the
bushes
and
trees
around
were
with
squirrel
fur
and
shining
bright
with
squirrel
eyes
then
sep
said
the
princess
back
her
eyes
and
her
hearing
and
her
voice
but
the
mole
would
not
the
princess
back
her
eyes
and
her
hearing
and
her
voice
said
sep
again
but
the
mole
only
gnashed
his
wicked
teeth
and
snarled
and
then
in
a
minute
the
squirrels
fell
on
the
mole
and
killed
it
and
sep
thanked
them
and
rode
back
to
the
palace
for
of
course
he
knew
that
when
a
magician
is
killed
all
his
magic
unworks
itself
instantly
but
when
he
got
to
his
princess
she
was
still
as
deaf
as
a
post
and
as
dumb
as
a
stone
and
she
was
still
crying
bitterly
with
her
poor
blind
eyes
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
gown
with
the
red
roses
on
it
up
my
sweetheart
he
said
though
he
knew
she
could
hear
him
and
as
he
spoke
the
wind
came
in
at
the
open
window
and
spoke
very
softly
because
it
was
in
the
presence
of
the
princess
right
it
whispered
old
villain
gave
us
the
slip
that
journey
got
out
of
the
in
the
very
nick
of
time
he
a
wild
boar
now
said
sep
fingering
his
kill
that
myself
without
asking
it
any
questions
so
he
went
and
fought
it
but
it
was
a
most
uncommon
boar
as
big
as
a
horse
with
tusks
half
a
yard
long
and
although
sep
wounded
it
it
jerked
the
sword
out
of
his
hand
with
its
tusk
and
was
just
going
to
trample
him
out
of
life
with
its
hard
heavy
when
a
great
roar
sounded
through
the
forest
would
ye
said
the
lion
and
fastened
teeth
and
claws
in
the
great
boar
back
the
boar
turned
with
a
scream
of
rage
but
the
lion
had
got
a
good
grip
and
it
did
not
loosen
teeth
or
claws
till
the
boar
lay
quiet
he
dead
asked
sep
when
he
came
to
himself
yes
he
right
enough
said
the
lion
but
the
wind
came
up
puffing
and
blowing
and
said
no
good
he
got
away
again
and
now
he
a
fish
i
was
just
a
minute
too
late
to
see
fish
an
old
oyster
told
me
about
it
only
he
had
the
wit
to
notice
what
particular
fish
the
scoundrel
changed
into
so
then
sep
went
back
to
the
palace
and
he
said
to
the
king
me
marry
the
dear
princess
and
we
go
out
and
seek
our
fortune
i
got
to
kill
that
magician
and
i
do
it
too
or
my
name
not
septimus
septimusson
but
it
may
take
years
and
years
and
i
ca
be
away
from
the
princess
all
that
time
because
she
wo
eat
unless
i
feed
her
you
see
the
difficulty
sire
the
king
saw
it
and
that
very
day
sep
was
married
to
the
princess
in
her
green
gown
with
the
red
roses
on
it
and
they
set
out
together
the
wind
went
with
them
and
the
wind
or
something
else
seemed
to
say
to
sep
home
take
your
wife
home
to
your
mother
so
he
did
he
crossed
the
land
and
he
crossed
the
sea
and
he
went
up
the
path
to
his
father
cottage
and
he
peeped
in
at
the
door
and
said
mother
here
my
wife
they
were
so
pleased
to
see
him
for
they
had
thought
him
dead
that
they
did
notice
the
princess
at
first
and
when
they
did
notice
her
they
wondered
at
her
beautiful
face
and
her
beautiful
gown
but
it
was
till
they
had
all
settled
down
to
supper
boiled
rabbit
it
was
and
they
noticed
sep
feeding
his
wife
as
one
feeds
a
baby
that
they
saw
that
she
was
blind
and
then
all
the
story
had
to
be
told
well
said
the
fisherman
and
your
wife
bide
here
with
us
i
daresay
i
catch
that
old
sinner
in
my
nets
one
of
these
fine
days
but
he
never
did
and
sep
and
his
wife
lived
with
the
old
people
and
they
were
happy
after
a
fashion
but
of
an
evening
sep
used
to
wander
and
wonder
and
wonder
and
wander
by
the
wondering
as
he
wandered
whether
he
would
ever
have
the
luck
to
catch
that
fish
and
one
evening
as
he
wandered
wondering
he
heard
a
little
sharp
thin
voice
say
i
got
it
asked
sep
forgetting
his
manners
got
it
said
a
big
mussel
on
a
rock
close
by
him
magic
stone
that
the
magician
does
his
enchantments
with
he
dropped
it
out
of
his
mouth
and
i
shut
my
shells
on
it
and
now
he
sweeping
up
and
down
the
sea
like
a
mad
fish
looking
for
it
for
he
knows
he
can
never
change
into
anything
else
unless
he
gets
it
back
here
take
the
nasty
thing
it
making
me
feel
quite
it
opened
its
shells
wide
and
sep
saw
a
pearl
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
it
better
said
the
mussel
washing
its
shells
out
with
salt
water
do
magic
with
it
sep
eagerly
asked
said
the
mussel
sadly
of
no
use
to
any
one
but
the
owner
now
if
i
were
you
i
get
into
a
boat
and
if
your
friend
the
wind
will
help
us
i
believe
we
really
can
do
the
trick
at
your
service
of
course
said
the
wind
getting
up
instantly
the
mussel
whispered
to
the
wind
who
rushed
off
at
once
and
sep
launched
his
boat
said
the
mussel
get
into
the
very
middle
of
the
sea
or
as
near
as
you
can
guess
it
the
wind
will
warn
all
the
other
fishes
as
he
spoke
he
disappeared
in
the
dark
waters
sep
got
the
boat
into
the
middle
of
the
sea
as
near
as
he
could
guess
it
and
waited
after
a
long
time
he
saw
something
swirling
about
in
a
sort
of
whirlpool
about
a
hundred
yards
from
his
boat
but
when
he
tried
to
move
the
boat
towards
it
her
bows
ran
on
to
something
hard
still
keep
still
keep
still
cried
thousands
and
thousands
of
sharp
thin
little
voices
kill
us
if
you
move
then
he
looked
over
the
boat
side
and
saw
that
the
hard
something
was
nothing
but
thousands
and
thousands
of
mussels
all
jammed
close
together
and
through
the
clear
water
more
and
more
were
coming
and
piling
themselves
together
almost
at
once
his
boat
was
slowly
lifted
the
top
of
the
mussel
heap
showed
through
the
water
and
there
he
was
high
and
dry
on
a
mussel
reef
and
in
all
that
part
of
the
sea
the
water
was
disappearing
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
stretched
a
great
plain
of
purple
and
gray
the
shells
of
countless
mussels
only
at
one
spot
there
was
still
a
splashing
then
a
mussel
opened
its
shell
and
spoke
got
him
it
said
piled
our
selves
up
till
we
filled
this
part
of
the
sea
the
wind
warned
all
the
good
fishes
and
we
got
the
old
traitor
in
a
little
pool
over
there
get
out
and
walk
over
our
backs
we
all
lie
sideways
so
as
not
to
hurt
you
you
must
catch
the
fish
but
whatever
you
do
do
kill
it
till
we
give
the
word
sep
promised
and
he
got
out
and
walked
over
the
mussels
to
the
pool
and
when
he
saw
the
wicked
soul
of
the
magician
looking
out
through
the
round
eyes
of
a
big
finny
fish
he
remembered
all
that
his
princess
had
suffered
and
he
longed
to
draw
his
sword
and
kill
the
wicked
thing
then
and
there
but
he
remembered
his
promise
he
threw
a
net
about
it
and
dragged
it
back
to
the
boat
the
mussels
dispersed
and
let
the
boat
down
again
into
the
water
and
he
rowed
home
towing
the
evil
fish
in
the
net
by
a
line
he
beached
the
boat
and
looked
along
the
shore
the
shore
looked
a
very
odd
colour
and
well
it
might
for
every
bit
of
the
sand
was
covered
with
mussels
they
had
all
come
up
out
of
the
sea
leaving
just
one
little
bit
of
real
yellow
sand
for
him
to
beach
the
boat
on
said
millions
of
sharp
thin
little
voices
him
kill
him
sep
drew
his
sword
and
waded
into
the
shallow
surf
and
killed
the
evil
fish
with
one
strong
stroke
then
such
a
shout
went
up
all
along
the
shore
as
that
shore
had
never
heard
and
all
along
the
shore
where
the
mussels
had
been
stood
men
in
armour
and
men
in
and
men
in
leather
aprons
and
coats
and
women
and
children
a
whole
nation
of
people
close
by
the
boat
stood
a
king
and
queen
with
crowns
upon
their
heads
you
sep
said
the
king
saved
us
all
i
am
the
king

doomed
to
be
a
mussel
so
long
as
that
wretch
lived
you
have
set
us
all
free
and
look
down
the
path
from
the
shore
came
running
his
own
princess
who
hung
round
his
neck
crying
his
name
and
looking
at
him
with
the
most
beautiful
eyes
in
the
world
said
the
mussel
king

shall
be
our
son
and

old
fisherman

his
majesty

the

kissing
sep
mother
said
sep
mother

inch

with

so
they
all
went
back
by
way
of
the
foreign
country
where
sep
had
found
his
princess
and
they
called
on
the
old
lord
he
had
lost

they
easily
persuaded

king

the
old
lord

and

librarian
if

may
reigning

they
went
on
to
sep
and
when
he
saw
how
happy
they
all
were
together
he
said
my
beard
but
i
half
a
mind
to
come
with
you
along
said
the
mussel
king

or

the
other

quickly

kingdom

buy
a
president
and
be
a
republic
if
it
likes
i
going
to
catch

and
so
he
does
most
happily
up
to
this
very
minute
and
sep
and
his
dear
princess
are
as
happy
as
they
deserve
to
be
some
people

we

all
as
happy
as

but
i
am
not
sure
vi
the
white
cat
the
white
cat
lived
at
the
back
of
a
shelf
at
the
darkest
end
of
the
inside
attic
which
was
nearly
dark
all
over
it
had
lived
there
for
years
because
one
of
its
white
china
ears
was
chipped
so
that
it
was
no
longer
a
possible
ornament
for
the
spare
bedroom
tavy
found
it
at
the
climax
of
a
wicked
and
glorious
afternoon
he
had
been
left
alone
the
servants
were
the
only
other
people
in
the
house
he
had
promised
to
be
good
he
had
meant
to
be
good
and
he
had
not
been
he
had
done
everything
you
can
think
of
he
had
walked
into
the
duck
pond
and
not
a
stitch
of
his
clothes
but
had
had
to
be
changed
he
had
climbed
on
a
hay
rick
and
fallen
off
it
and
had
not
broken
his
neck
which
as
cook
told
him
he
richly
deserved
to
do
he
had
found
a
mouse
in
the
trap
and
put
it
in
the
kitchen
so
that
when
cook
went
to
make
tea
it
jumped
out
at
her
and
affected
her
to
screams
followed
by
tears
tavy
was
sorry
for
this
of
course
and
said
so
like
a
man
he
had
only
he
explained
meant
to
give
her
a
little
start
in
the
confusion
that
followed
the
mouse
he
had
eaten
all
the
jam
that
was
put
out
for
kitchen
tea
and
for
this
too
he
apologised
handsomely
as
soon
as
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
he
had
broken
a
pane
of
the
greenhouse
with
a
stone
and
but
why
pursue
the
painful
theme
the
last
thing
he
had
done
was
to
explore
the
attic
where
he
was
never
allowed
to
go
and
to
knock
down
the
white
cat
from
its
shelf
the
sound
of
its
fall
brought
the
servants
the
cat
was
not
broken
only
its
other
ear
was
chipped
tavy
was
put
to
bed
but
he
got
out
as
soon
as
the
servants
had
gone
downstairs
crept
up
to
the
attic
secured
the
cat
and
washed
it
in
the
bath
so
that
when
mother
came
back
from
london
tavy
dancing
impatiently
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
a
very
wet
flung
himself
upon
her
and
cried
been
awfully
naughty
and
i
frightfully
sorry
and
please
may
i
have
the
white
cat
for
my
very
own
he
was
much
sorrier
than
he
had
expected
to
be
when
he
saw
that
mother
was
too
tired
even
to
want
to
know
as
she
generally
did
exactly
how
naughty
he
had
been
she
only
kissed
him
and
said
am
sorry
you
been
naughty
my
darling
go
back
to
bed
now
tavy
was
ashamed
to
say
anything
more
about
the
china
cat
so
he
went
back
to
bed
but
he
took
the
cat
with
him
and
talked
to
it
and
kissed
it
and
went
to
sleep
with
its
smooth
shiny
shoulder
against
his
cheek
in
the
days
that
followed
he
was
extravagantly
good
being
good
seemed
as
easy
as
being
bad
usually
was
this
may
have
been
because
mother
seemed
so
tired
and
ill
and
gentlemen
in
black
coats
and
high
hats
came
to
see
mother
and
after
they
had
gone
she
used
to
cry
these
things
going
on
in
a
house
sometimes
make
people
good
sometimes
they
act
just
the
other
way
or
it
may
have
been
because
he
had
the
china
cat
to
talk
to
anyhow
whichever
way
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
week
mother
said
you
been
a
dear
good
boy
and
a
great
comfort
to
me
you
must
have
tried
very
hard
to
be
good
it
was
difficult
to
say
i
have
at
least
not
since
the
first
day
but
tavy
got
it
said
and
was
hugged
for
his
pains
wanted
said
mother
china
cat
well
you
may
have
it
my
very
own
your
very
own
but
you
must
be
very
careful
not
to
break
it
and
you
must
give
it
away
it
goes
with
the
house
your
aunt
jane
made
me
promise
to
keep
it
in
the
family
it
very
very
old
do
take
it
out
of
doors
for
fear
of
accidents
love
the
white
cat
mother
said
tavy
love
it
all
my
toys
then
mother
told
tavy
several
things
and
that
night
when
he
went
to
bed
tavy
repeated
them
all
faithfully
to
the
china
cat
who
was
about
six
inches
high
and
looked
very
intelligent
you
see
he
ended
wicked
lawyer
taken
nearly
all
money
and
we
got
to
leave
our
own
lovely
big
white
house
and
go
and
live
in
a
horrid
little
house
with
another
house
glued
on
to
its
side
and
mother
does
hate
it
so
do
wonder
said
the
china
cat
very
distinctly
said
tavy
into
his
said
i
do
wonder
octavius
said
the
china
cat
and
rose
from
her
sitting
position
stretched
her
china
legs
and
waved
her
white
china
tail
can
speak
said
tavy
you
see
i
can
hear
i
mean
said
the
cat

to
you
now
so
i
can
speak
to
you
i
could
before
it
would
have
been
manners
tavy
his
round
his
neck
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
his
mouth
open
do
look
so
silly
said
the
cat
taking
a
walk
along
the
high
wooden
mantelpiece
one
would
think
you
did
me
to
talk
to
you
you
to
said
tavy
recovering
himself
a
little
then
said
the
cat
i
touch
you
tavy
asked
timidly
course
i
belong
to
you
look
out
the
china
cat
gathered
herself
together
and
jumped
tavy
caught
her
it
was
quite
a
shock
to
find
when
one
stroked
her
that
the
china
cat
though
alive
was
still
china
hard
cold
and
smooth
to
the
touch
and
yet
perfectly
brisk
and
absolutely
bendable
as
any
flesh
and
blood
cat
dear
white
pussy
said
tavy
do
love
you
i
love
you
purred
the
cat
i
should
never
have
lowered
myself
to
begin
a
conversation
wish
you
were
a
real
cat
said
tavy
am
said
the
cat
how
shall
we
amuse
ourselves
i
suppose
you
do
care
for
sport
mousing
i
mean
never
tried
said
tavy
i
think
i
rather
would
well
then
octavius
said
the
cat
take
you
to
the
white
cat
castle
get
into
bed
bed
makes
a
good
travelling
carriage
especially
when
you
have
any
other
shut
your
eyes
tavy
did
as
he
was
told
shut
his
eyes
but
could
not
keep
them
shut
he
opened
them
a
tiny
tiny
chink
and
sprang
up
he
was
not
in
bed
he
was
on
a
couch
of
soft
and
the
couch
stood
in
a
splendid
hall
whose
walls
were
of
gold
and
ivory
by
him
stood
the
white
cat
no
longer
china
but
real
live
cat
and
fur
as
cats
should
be
we
are
she
said
journey
did
take
long
did
it
now
we
have
that
splendid
supper
out
of
the
fairy
tale
with
the
invisible
hands
waiting
on
us
she
clapped
her
paws
paws
now
as
soft
as
white
velvet
and
a
floated
into
the
room
then
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
and
glasses
the
table
was
laid
the
dishes
drifted
in
and
they
began
to
eat
there
happened
to
be
every
single
thing
tavy
liked
best
to
eat
after
supper
there
was
music
and
singing
and
tavy
having
kissed
a
white
soft
furry
forehead
went
to
bed
in
a
gold
with
a
counterpane
of
butterflies
wings
he
awoke
at
home
on
the
mantelpiece
sat
the
white
cat
looking
as
though
butter
would
not
melt
in
her
mouth
and
all
her
furriness
had
gone
with
her
voice
she
was
silent
and
china
tavy
spoke
to
her
but
she
would
not
answer
nor
did
she
speak
all
day
only
at
night
when
he
was
getting
into
bed
she
suddenly
mewed
stretched
and
said
haste
there
a
play
acted
at
my
castle
tavy
made
haste
and
was
rewarded
by
another
glorious
evening
in
the
castle
of
the
white
cat
and
so
the
weeks
went
on
days
full
of
an
ordinary
little
boy
joys
and
sorrows
goodnesses
and
badnesses
nights
spent
by
a
little
prince
in
the
magic
castle
of
the
white
cat
then
came
the
day
when
tavy
mother
spoke
to
him
and
he
very
scared
and
serious
told
the
china
cat
what
she
had
said
knew
this
would
happen
said
the
cat
always
does
so
you
to
leave
your
house
next
week
well
there
only
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
draw
your
sword
tavy
and
cut
off
my
head
and
tail
then
will
you
turn
into
a
princess
and
shall
i
have
to
marry
you
tavy
asked
with
horror
dear
no
said
the
cat
reassuringly
turn
into
anything
but
you
and
mother
will
turn
into
happy
people
i
shall
just
not
any
more
for
you
i
wo
do
it
said
tavy
you
must
come
draw
your
sword
like
a
brave
fairy
prince
and
cut
off
my
head
the
sword
hung
above
his
bed
with
the
helmet
and
uncle
james
had
given
him
last
christmas
not
a
fairy
prince
said
the
child
tavy
and
i
love
you
love
your
mother
better
said
the
cat
cut
my
head
off
the
story
always
ends
like
that
you
love
mother
best
it
for
her
sake
tavy
was
trying
to
think
it
out
i
love
mother
best
but
i
love
and
i
wo
cut
off
your
head
no
not
even
for
mother
said
the
cat
must
do
what
i
can
she
stood
up
waving
her
white
china
tail
and
before
tavy
could
stop
her
she
had
leapt
not
as
before
into
his
arms
but
on
to
the
wide
hearthstone
it
was
all
over
the
china
cat
lay
broken
inside
the
high
brass
fender
the
sound
of
the
smash
brought
mother
running
is
it
she
cried
tavy
the
china
cat
would
do
it
sobbed
tavy
wanted
me
to
cut
off
her
i
would
talk
nonsense
dear
said
mother
sadly
only
makes
it
worse
pick
up
the
pieces
only
two
pieces
said
tavy
you
stick
her
together
again
said
mother
holding
the
pieces
close
to
the
candle
been
broken
before
and
mended
knew
that
said
tavy
still
sobbing
my
dear
white
cat
oh
oh
oh
the
last
was
a
howl
of
anguish
crying
wo
mend
her
said
mother
there
another
piece
of
her
close
to
the
shovel
tavy
stooped
not
a
piece
of
cat
he
said
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
pale
parchment
label
tied
to
a
key
mother
held
it
to
the
candle
and
read
of
the
lock
behind
the
knot
in
the
mantelpiece
panel
in
the
white
i
wonder
but
where
did
it
come
from
of
my
white
cat
i
said
tavy
his
tears
stopping
you
going
to
see
what
in
the
mantelpiece
panel
mother
are
you
oh
do
let
me
come
and
see
too
do
deserve
mother
began
and
ended
put
your
on
then
they
went
down
the
gallery
past
the
pictures
and
the
stuffed
birds
and
tables
with
china
on
them
and
downstairs
on
to
the
white
parlour
but
they
could
not
see
any
knot
in
the
mantelpiece
panel
because
it
was
all
painted
white
but
mother
fingers
felt
softly
all
over
it
and
found
a
round
raised
spot
it
was
a
knot
sure
enough
then
she
scraped
round
it
with
her
scissors
till
she
loosened
the
knot
and
poked
it
out
with
the
scissors
point
do
suppose
there
any
keyhole
there
really
she
said
but
there
was
and
what
is
more
the
key
fitted
the
panel
swung
open
and
inside
was
a
little
cupboard
with
two
shelves
what
was
on
the
shelves
there
were
old
laces
and
old
embroideries
old
jewelry
and
old
silver
there
was
money
and
there
were
dusty
old
papers
that
tavy
thought
most
uninteresting
but
mother
did
not
think
them
uninteresting
she
laughed
and
cried
or
nearly
cried
and
said
tavy
this
was
why
the
china
cat
was
to
be
taken
such
care
of
then
she
told
him
how
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
the
head
of
the
house
had
gone
out
to
fight
for
the
pretender
and
had
told
his
daughter
to
take
the
greatest
care
of
the
china
cat
will
send
you
word
of
the
reason
by
a
sure
hand
he
said
for
they
parted
on
the
open
square
where
any
spy
might
have
overheard
anything
and
he
had
been
killed
by
an
ambush
not
ten
miles
from
home
and
his
daughter
had
never
known
but
she
had
kept
the
cat
now
it
has
saved
us
said
mother
can
stay
in
the
dear
old
house
and
there
are
two
other
houses
that
will
belong
to
us
too
i
think
and
oh
tavy
would
you
like
some
and
dear
tavy
did
like
and
had
it
the
china
cat
was
mended
but
it
was
put
in
the
corner
cupboard
in
the
because
it
had
saved
the
house
now
i
dare
say
you
think
this
is
all
nonsense
and
a
story
not
at
all
if
it
were
how
would
you
account
for
tavy
finding
the
very
next
night
fast
asleep
on
his
pillow
his
own
white
cat
the
furry
friend
that
the
china
cat
used
to
turn
into
every
evening
the
dear
hostess
who
had
amused
him
so
well
in
the
white
cat
fairy
palace
it
was
she
beyond
a
doubt
and
that
was
why
tavy
did
mind
a
bit
about
the
china
cat
being
taken
from
him
and
kept
under
glass
you
may
think
that
it
was
just
any
old
stray
white
cat
that
had
come
in
by
accident
tavy
knows
better
it
has
the
very
same
tender
tone
in
its
purr
that
the
magic
white
cat
had
it
will
not
talk
to
tavy
it
is
true
but
tavy
can
and
does
talk
to
it
but
the
thing
that
makes
it
perfectly
certain
that
it
is
the
white
cat
is
that
the
tips
of
its
two
ears
are
missing
just
as
the
china
cat
ears
were
if
you
say
that
it
might
have
lost
its
in
battle
you
are
the
kind
of
person
who
always
difficulties
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
the
kind
of
splendid
magics
that
happened
to
tavy
will
never
happen
to
vii
belinda
and
bellamant
or
the
bells
of
there
is
a
certain
country
where
a
king
is
never
allowed
to
reign
while
a
queen
can
be
found
they
like
queens
much
better
than
kings
in
that
country
i
ca
think
why
if
some
one
has
tried
to
teach
you
a
little
history
you
will
perhaps
think
that
this
is
the
salic
law
but
it
is
in
the
biggest
city
of
that
odd
country
there
is
a
great
higher
than
the
of
the
houses
of
parliament
where
they
put
who
forget
their
manners
this
had
seven
bells
in
it
very
splendid
bells
made
expressly
to
ring
on
the
joyful
occasions
when
a
princess
was
born
who
would
be
queen
some
day
and
the
great
tower
was
built
expressly
for
the
bells
to
ring
in
so
you
see
what
a
lot
they
thought
of
queens
in
that
country
now
in
all
the
bells
there
are
it
is
their
voices
that
you
hear
when
the
bells
ring
all
that
about
its
being
the
clapper
of
the
bell
is
mere
nonsense
and
would
hardly
deceive
a
child
i
do
know
why
people
say
such
things
most
are
very
energetic
busy
folk
who
love
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
and
hate
being
idle
and
when
nearly
two
hundred
years
had
gone
by
and
no
princesses
had
been
born
they
got
tired
of
living
in
bells
that
were
never
rung
so
they
slipped
out
of
the
belfry
one
fine
frosty
night
and
left
the
big
beautiful
bells
empty
and
went
off
to
find
other
homes
one
of
them
went
to
live
in
a
and
one
in
a
and
the
rest
all
found
homes
they
did
not
mind
where
just
anywhere
in
fact
where
they
could
find
any
kind
enough
to
give
them
board
and
lodging
and
every
one
was
surprised
at
the
increased
loudness
in
the
voices
of
these
hospitable
bells
for
of
course
the
from
the
belfry
did
their
best
to
help
in
the
housework
as
polite
guests
should
and
always
added
their
voices
to
those
of
their
hosts
on
all
occasions
when
was
called
for
and
the
seven
big
beautiful
bells
in
the
belfry
were
left
hollow
and
dark
and
quite
empty
except
for
the
clappers
who
did
not
care
about
the
comforts
of
a
home
now
of
course
a
good
house
does
not
remain
empty
long
especially
when
there
is
no
rent
to
pay
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
seven
bells
all
had
tenants
and
they
were
all
the
kind
of
folk
that
no
respectable
would
care
to
be
acquainted
with
they
had
been
turned
out
of
other
bells
cracked
bells
and
broken
bells
the
bells
of
horses
that
had
been
lost
in
snowstorms
or
of
ships
that
had
gone
down
at
sea
they
hated
work
and
they
were
a
glum
silent
disagreeable
people
but
as
far
as
they
could
be
pleased
about
anything
they
were
pleased
to
live
in
bells
that
were
never
rung
in
houses
where
there
was
nothing
to
do
they
sat
hunched
up
under
the
black
domes
of
their
houses
dressed
in
darkness
and
cobwebs
and
their
only
pleasure
was
idleness
their
only
feasts
the
thick
dusty
silence
that
lies
heavy
in
all
belfries
where
the
bells
never
ring
they
hardly
ever
spoke
even
to
each
other
and
in
the
whispers
that
good
talk
in
among
themselves
and
that
no
one
can
hear
but
the
bat
whose
ear
for
music
is
very
fine
and
who
has
himself
a
particularly
high
voice
and
when
they
did
speak
they
quarrelled
and
when
at
last
the
bells
rung
for
the
birth
of
a
princess
the
wicked
were
furious
of
course
they
had
to
a
bell
ca
help
that
when
the
rope
is
pulled
but
their
voices
were
so
ugly
that
people
were
quite
shocked
poor
taste
our
ancestors
must
have
had
they
said
think
these
were
good
bells
you
remember
the
bells
had
not
rung
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
me
said
the
king
to
the
queen
odd
ideas
people
had
in
the
old
days
i
always
understood
that
these
bells
had
beautiful
voices
quite
hideous
said
the
queen
and
so
they
were
now
that
night
the
lazy
came
down
out
of
the
belfry
full
of
anger
against
the
princess
whose
birth
had
disturbed
their
idleness
there
is
no
anger
like
that
of
a
lazy
person
who
is
made
to
work
against
his
will
and
they
crept
out
of
the
dark
domes
of
their
houses
and
came
down
in
their
dust
dresses
and
cobweb
cloaks
and
crept
up
to
the
palace
where
every
one
had
gone
to
bed
long
before
and
stood
round
the
cradle
where
the
baby
princess
lay
asleep
and
they
reached
their
seven
dark
right
hands
out
across
the
white
satin
coverlet
and
the
oldest
and
hoarsest
and
laziest
said
shall
grow
uglier
every
day
except
sundays
and
every
sunday
she
shall
be
seven
times
prettier
than
the
sunday
before
not
uglier
every
day
and
a
double
dose
on
sunday
asked
the
youngest
and
spitefullest
of
the
wicked
there
no
rule
without
an
exception
said
the
eldest
and
hoarsest
and
laziest
she
feel
it
all
the
more
if
she
pretty
once
a
week
and
he
added
shall
go
on
till
she
finds
a
bell
that
does
ring
and
ca
ring
and
never
will
ring
and
was
made
to
ring
not
for
ever
asked
the
young
and
spiteful
goes
on
for
ever
said
the
eldest
even
and
we
have
to
leave
her
a
way
out
it
does
matter
never
know
what
it
is
let
alone
finding
it
then
they
went
back
to
the
belfry
and
rearranged
as
well
as
they
could
the
comfortable
nest
furniture
of
their
houses
which
had
all
been
shaken
up
and
disarranged
by
that
absurd
ringing
of
bells
at
the
birth
of
a
princess
that
nobody
could
really
be
pleased
about
when
the
princess
was
two
weeks
old
the
king
said
to
the
queen
love
the
princess
is
not
so
handsome
as
i
thought
she
was
henry
said
the
queen
light
not
good
that
all
next
day
it
was
sunday
the
king
pulled
back
the
lace
curtains
of
the
cradle
and
said
light
good
enough
now
and
you
see
she
he
stopped
have
been
the
light
he
said
looks
all
right
course
she
does
a
precious
said
the
queen
but
on
monday
morning
his
majesty
was
quite
sure
really
that
the
princess
was
rather
plain
for
a
princess
and
when
sunday
came
and
the
princess
had
on
her
best
robe
and
the
cap
with
the
little
white
ribbons
in
the
frill
he
rubbed
his
nose
and
said
there
was
no
doubt
dress
did
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
for
the
princess
was
now
as
pretty
as
a
new
daisy
the
princess
was
several
years
old
before
her
mother
could
be
got
to
see
that
it
really
was
better
for
the
child
to
wear
plain
clothes
and
a
veil
on
week
days
on
sundays
of
course
she
could
wear
her
best
frock
and
a
clean
crown
just
like
anybody
else
of
course
nobody
ever
told
the
princess
how
ugly
she
was
she
wore
a
veil
on
and
so
did
every
one
else
in
the
palace
and
she
was
never
allowed
to
look
in
the
glass
except
on
sundays
so
that
she
had
no
idea
that
she
was
not
as
pretty
all
the
week
as
she
was
on
the
first
day
of
it
she
grew
up
therefore
quite
contented
but
the
parents
were
in
despair
said
king
henry
high
time
she
was
married
we
ought
to
choose
a
king
to
rule
the
realm
i
have
always
looked
forward
to
her
marrying
at
and
to
our
retiring
on
a
modest
competence
to
some
nice
little
place
in
the
country
where
we
could
have
a
few
pigs
a
cow
said
the
queen
wiping
her
eyes
a
pony
and
trap
said
the
king
hens
said
the
queen
and
now
it
can
never
never
be
look
at
the
child
i
just
ask
you
look
at
her
said
the
king
firmly
have
done
that
since
she
was
ten
except
on
sundays
we
get
a
prince
to
agree
to
a
sundays
only
marriage
not
let
him
see
her
during
the
week
an
unusual
arrangement
said
the
king
involve
very
awkward
explanations
and
i
ca
think
of
any
except
the
true
ones
which
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
you
see
we
should
want
a
prince
and
no
really
highness
would
take
a
wife
on
those
terms
a
thoroughly
comfortable
kingdom
said
the
queen
doubtfully
young
man
would
be
handsomely
provided
for
for
life
could
marry
belinda
to
a
or
a
said
the
king
decidedly
meanwhile
the
princess
had
taken
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
she
had
fallen
in
love
you
know
of
course
that
a
handsome
book
is
sent
out
every
year
to
all
the
kings
who
have
daughters
to
marry
it
is
rather
like
the
illustrated
catalogues
of
liberty
or
peter
robinson
only
instead
of
illustrations
showing
furniture
or
ladies
cloaks
and
dresses
the
pictures
are
all
of
princes
who
are
of
an
age
to
be
married
and
are
looking
out
for
suitable
wives
the
book
is
called
the
match
catalogue
illustrated
and
besides
the
pictures
of
the
princes
it
has
little
printed
bits
about
their
incomes
accomplishments
prospects
and
tempers
and
relations
now
the
princess
saw
this
book
which
is
never
shown
to
princesses
but
only
to
their
parents
it
was
carelessly
left
lying
on
the
round
table
in
the
parlour
she
looked
all
through
it
and
she
hated
each
prince
more
than
the
one
before
till
she
came
to
the
very
end
and
on
the
last
page
of
all
screwed
away
in
a
corner
was
the
picture
of
a
prince
who
was
quite
as
as
a
prince
has
any
call
to
be
like
said
belinda
softly
then
she
read
the
little
bit
of
print
underneath
bellamant
aged
wants
princess
who
does
object
to
a
christening
curse
nature
of
curse
only
revealed
in
the
strictest
confidence
good
tempered
comfortably
off
quiet
habits
no
dear
said
the
princess
wonder
what
the
curse
is
i
sure
should
mind
the
blue
dusk
of
evening
was
deepening
in
the
garden
outside
the
princess
rang
for
the
lamp
and
went
to
draw
the
curtain
there
was
a
rustle
and
a
faint
high
squeak
and
something
black
flopped
on
to
the
floor
and
fluttered
there
it
a
bat
cried
the
princess
as
the
lamp
came
in
do
like
bats
me
fetch
a
and
brush
and
sweep
the
nasty
thing
away
said
the
parlourmaid
no
said
belinda
hurt
poor
dear
and
though
she
hated
bats
she
picked
it
up
it
was
horribly
cold
to
touch
one
wing
dragged
loosely
can
go
jane
said
the
princess
to
the
parlourmaid
then
she
got
a
big
box
that
had
had
chocolate
in
it
and
put
some
cotton
wool
in
it
and
said
to
the
bat
poor
dear
is
that
comfortable
and
the
bat
said
thanks
gracious
said
the
princess
jumping
did
know
bats
could
talk
one
can
talk
said
the
bat
not
every
one
can
hear
other
people
talking
you
have
a
fine
ear
as
well
as
a
fine
heart
your
wing
ever
get
well
asked
the
princess
hope
so
said
the
bat
let
talk
about
you
do
you
know
why
you
wear
a
veil
every
day
except
sundays
everybody
asked
belinda
here
in
the
palace
said
the
bat
on
your
account
why
asked
the
princess
in
the
glass
and
you
know
it
wicked
to
look
in
the
glass
except
on
sundays
and
besides
they
all
put
away
said
the
princess
i
were
you
said
the
bat
should
go
up
into
the
attic
where
the
youngest
kitchenmaid
sleeps
feel
between
the
thatch
and
the
wall
just
above
her
pillow
and
you
find
a
little
round
but
come
back
here
before
you
look
at
it
the
princess
did
exactly
what
the
bat
told
her
to
do
and
when
she
had
come
back
into
the
parlour
and
shut
the
door
she
looked
in
the
little
round
glass
that
the
youngest
sweetheart
had
given
her
and
when
she
saw
her
ugly
ugly
ugly
face
for
you
must
remember
she
had
been
growing
uglier
every
day
since
she
was
born
she
screamed
and
then
she
said
not
me
it
a
horrid
picture
you
though
said
the
bat
firmly
but
kindly
now
you
see
why
you
wear
a
veil
all
the
week
and
only
look
in
the
glass
on
sunday
why
asked
the
princess
in
tears
do
i
look
like
that
in
the
sunday
you
are
like
that
on
sundays
the
bat
replied
it
went
on
crying
i
did
tell
you
the
dread
secret
of
your
ugliness
just
to
make
you
cry
but
because
i
know
the
way
for
you
to
be
as
pretty
all
the
week
as
you
are
on
sundays
and
since
you
been
so
kind
to
me
i
tell
you
sit
down
close
beside
me
it
fatigues
me
to
speak
loud
the
princess
did
and
listened
through
her
veil
and
her
tears
while
the
bat
told
her
all
that
i
began
this
story
by
telling
you
heard
the
tale
years
ago
he
said
in
the
dark
dusty
beautiful
comfortable
cobwebby
belfry
and
i
have
heard
scraps
of
it
myself
when
the
evil
were
quarrelling
or
talking
in
their
sleep
lazy
things
very
good
of
you
to
tell
me
all
this
said
belinda
what
am
i
to
do
must
find
the
bell
that
does
ring
and
ca
ring
and
never
will
ring
and
was
made
to
ring
i
were
a
prince
said
the
princess
could
go
out
and
seek
my
fortune
have
fortunes
as
well
as
princes
said
the
bat
father
and
mother
would
never
let
me
go
and
look
for
mine
said
the
bat
you
find
a
way
so
belinda
thought
and
thought
and
at
last
she
got
the
book
that
had
the
portraits
of
eligible
princes
in
it
and
she
wrote
to
the
prince
who
had
the
christening
curse
and
this
is
what
she
said
belinda
of
is
not
afraid
of
christening
curses
if
prince
bellamant
would
like
to
marry
her
he
had
better
apply
to
her
royal
father
in
the
usual
way
i
have
seen
your
portrait
when
the
prince
got
this
letter
he
was
very
pleased
and
wrote
at
once
for
princess
belinda
likeness
of
course
they
sent
him
a
picture
of
her
sunday
face
which
was
the
most
beautiful
face
in
the
world
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
he
knew
that
this
was
not
only
the
most
beautiful
face
in
the
world
but
the
dearest
so
he
wrote
to
her
father
by
the
next
post
applying
for
her
hand
in
the
usual
way
and
enclosing
the
most
respectable
references
the
king
told
the
princess
said
he
do
you
say
to
this
young
man
and
the
princess
of
course
said
please
so
the
was
fixed
for
the
first
sunday
in
june
but
when
the
prince
arrived
with
all
his
glorious
following
of
courtiers
and
with
two
pink
peacocks
and
a
full
of
diamonds
for
his
bride
he
absolutely
refused
to
be
married
on
a
sunday
nor
would
he
give
any
reason
for
his
refusal
and
then
the
king
lost
his
temper
and
broke
off
the
match
and
the
prince
went
away
but
he
did
not
go
very
far
that
night
he
bribed
a
to
show
him
which
was
the
princess
room
and
he
climbed
up
by
the
jasmine
through
the
dark
night
and
tapped
at
the
window
dhere
said
the
princess
inside
in
the
dark
said
the
prince
in
the
dark
outside
id
true
said
the
princess
toad
be
you
ridded
away
a
cold
you
got
my
princess
said
the
prince
hanging
on
by
the
jasmine
boughs
not
a
cold
sniffed
the
princess
oh
you
dear
were
you
crying
because
you
thought
i
gone
he
said
suppose
so
said
she
he
said
dear
again
and
kissed
her
hands
would
you
be
married
on
a
sunday
she
asked
the
curse
dearest
he
explained
could
tell
any
one
but
you
the
fact
is
malevola
was
asked
to
my
christening
so
she
doomed
me
to
be
well
she
said
moderately
all
the
week
and
too
ugly
for
words
on
sundays
so
you
see
you
be
married
on
a
wo
you
i
ca
said
the
princess
i
got
a
curse
too
only
i
ugly
all
the
week
and
pretty
on
sundays
extremely
tiresome
said
the
prince
ca
you
be
cured
yes
said
the
princess
and
told
him
how
you
she
asked
yours
quite
incurable
at
all
he
answered
only
got
to
stay
under
water
for
five
minutes
and
the
spell
will
be
broken
but
you
see
beloved
the
difficulty
is
that
i
ca
do
it
i
practised
regularly
from
a
boy
in
the
sea
and
in
the
swimming
bath
and
even
in
my
basin
hours
at
a
time
i
practised
but
i
never
can
keep
under
more
than
two
minutes
dear
said
the
princess
is
dreadful
is
rather
trying
the
prince
answered
sure
you
like
me
she
asked
suddenly
you
know
that
only
pretty
once
a
week
die
for
you
said
he
i
tell
you
what
send
all
your
courtiers
away
and
take
a
situation
as
here
i
know
we
want
one
and
then
every
night
i
climb
down
the
jasmine
and
we
go
out
together
and
seek
our
fortune
i
sure
we
shall
find
it
and
they
did
go
out
the
very
next
night
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
they
did
not
find
their
fortunes
but
they
got
fonder
and
fonder
of
each
other
they
could
not
see
each
other
faces
but
they
held
hands
as
they
went
along
through
the
dark
and
on
the
seventh
night
as
they
passed
by
a
house
that
showed
chinks
of
light
through
its
shutters
they
heard
a
bell
being
rung
outside
for
supper
a
bell
with
a
very
loud
and
beautiful
voice
but
instead
of
saying
ready
as
any
one
would
have
expected
the
bell
was
saying
ding
dong
dell
could
tell
where
you
ought
to
go
to
break
the
spell
then
some
one
left
off
ringing
the
bell
so
of
course
it
could
say
any
more
so
the
two
went
on
a
little
way
down
the
road
a
tinkled
behind
the
wet
hedge
of
the
lane
and
it
said
not
i
am
quite
safe
as
a
should
but
ding
dong
dell
all
will
be
well
if
you
then
the
cow
stopped
walking
and
began
to
eat
so
the
bell
could
say
any
more
the
prince
and
princess
went
on
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
they
heard
the
voices
of
five
more
bells
that
night
the
next
was
a
the
schoolmaster
little
boy
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
ring
it
very
late
at
night
but
his
father
came
and
caught
him
before
the
bell
could
say
any
more
than
ding
a
dong
dell
you
can
break
up
the
spell
by
taking
so
that
was
no
good
then
there
were
the
three
bells
that
were
the
sign
over
the
door
of
an
inn
where
people
were
happily
dancing
to
a
fiddle
because
there
was
a
wedding
these
bells
said
we
are
the
merry
three
bells
bells
bells
you
are
two
to
undo
spells
spells
spells
then
the
wind
who
was
swinging
the
bells
suddenly
thought
of
an
appointment
he
had
made
with
a
pine
forest
to
get
up
an
entertaining
imitation
of
for
the
benefit
of
the
forest
nymphs
who
had
never
been
to
the
seaside
and
he
went
off
so
of
course
the
bells
could
ring
any
more
and
the
prince
and
princess
went
on
down
the
dark
road
there
was
a
cottage
and
the
princess
pulled
her
veil
closely
over
her
face
for
yellow
light
streamed
from
its
open
door
and
it
was
a
wednesday
inside
a
little
boy
was
sitting
on
the
floor
quite
a
little
boy
he
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
long
before
and
i
do
know
why
he
was
and
he
was
ringing
a
little
tinkling
bell
that
had
dropped
off
a
sleigh
and
this
little
bell
said
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
i
a
little
but
i
know
what
i
know
and
i
tell
tell
tell
find
the
enchanter
of
the
ringing
well
he
will
show
you
how
to
break
the
spell
spell
spell
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
i
a
little
but
i
know
what
i
know
and
so
on
over
and
over
again
and
again
because
the
little
boy
was
quite
contented
to
go
on
shaking
his
for
ever
and
ever
now
we
know
said
the
prince
that
glorious
very
but
where
the
enchanter
of
the
ringing
well
said
the
princess
doubtfully
i
got
address
in
my
said
the
prince
my
he
was
one
of
the
references
i
gave
your
father
so
the
next
night
the
prince
brought
a
horse
to
the
garden
and
he
and
the
princess
mounted
and
rode
and
rode
and
rode
and
in
the
grey
dawn
they
came
to
wonderwood
and
in
the
very
middle
of
that
the
palace
stands
the
princess
did
not
like
to
call
on
a
perfect
stranger
so
very
early
in
the
morning
so
they
decided
to
wait
a
little
and
look
about
them
the
castle
was
very
beautiful
decorated
with
a
conventional
design
of
bells
and
bell
ropes
carved
in
white
stone
luxuriant
plants
of
american
covered
the
drawbridge
and
portcullis
on
a
green
lawn
in
front
of
the
castle
was
a
well
with
a
curious
covering
suspended
over
it
the
lovers
leaned
over
the
mossy
wall
of
the
well
and
looking
down
they
could
see
that
the
narrowness
of
the
well
only
lasted
for
a
few
feet
and
below
that
it
spread
into
a
cavern
where
water
lay
in
a
big
pool
cheer
said
a
pleasant
voice
behind
them
it
was
the
enchanter
an
early
riser
like
darwin
was
and
all
other
great
scientific
men
they
told
him
what
cheer
prince
bellamant
ended
really
no
use
i
ca
keep
under
water
more
than
two
minutes
however
much
i
try
and
my
precious
belinda
not
likely
to
find
any
silly
old
bell
that
does
ring
and
ca
ring
and
never
will
ring
and
was
never
made
to
ring
ho
laughed
the
enchanter
with
the
soft
full
laughter
of
old
age
come
to
the
right
shop
who
told
you
bells
said
belinda
yes
the
old
man
frowned
kindly
upon
them
must
be
very
fond
of
each
other
are
said
the
two
together
the
enchanter
answered
only
true
lovers
can
hear
the
true
speech
of
the
bells
and
then
only
when
they
together
well
there
the
bell
he
pointed
to
the
covering
of
the
well
went
forward
and
touched
some
lever
or
spring
the
covering
swung
out
from
above
the
well
and
hung
over
the
grass
grey
with
the
dew
of
dawn
said
bellamant
said
his
does
ring
and
it
ca
ring
and
it
never
will
ring
and
it
was
never
made
to
ring
get
into
it
said
bellamant
forgetting
his
manners
the
old
man
took
a
hand
of
each
and
led
them
under
the
bell
they
looked
up
it
had
windows
of
thick
glass
and
high
seats
about
four
feet
from
its
edge
running
all
round
inside
your
seats
said
the
enchanter
bellamant
lifted
his
princess
to
the
bench
and
leaped
up
beside
her
said
the
old
man
still
hold
each
other
hands
and
for
your
lives
do
move
he
went
away
and
next
moment
they
felt
the
bell
swing
in
the
air
it
swung
round
till
once
more
it
was
over
the
well
and
then
it
went
down
down
down
not
afraid
with
you
said
belinda
because
she
was
dreadfully
down
went
the
bell
the
glass
windows
leaped
into
light
looking
through
them
the
two
could
see
blurred
glories
of
lamps
in
the
side
of
the
cave
magic
lamps
or
perhaps
merely
electric
which
curiously
enough
have
ceased
to
seem
magic
to
us
nowadays
then
with
a
plop
the
lower
edge
of
the
bell
met
the
water
the
water
rose
inside
it
a
little
then
not
any
more
and
the
bell
went
down
down
and
above
their
heads
the
green
water
lapped
against
the
windows
of
the
bell
under
water
if
we
stay
five
minutes
belinda
whispered
dear
said
bellamant
and
pulled
out
his
chronometer
five
minutes
for
you
but
oh
cried
belinda
for
me
for
i
found
the
bell
that
does
ring
and
ca
ring
and
never
will
ring
and
was
made
to
ring
oh
bellamant
dearest
it
thursday
i
got
my
sunday
face
she
tore
away
her
veil
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
face
could
not
leave
it
dream
of
all
the
world
delight
he
murmured
beautiful
you
are
neither
spoke
again
till
a
sudden
little
shock
told
them
that
the
bell
was
moving
up
again
said
bellamant
not
five
minutes
but
when
they
looked
at
the
chronometer
it
was
nearly
of
an
hour
but
then
of
course
the
well
was
enchanted
nonsense
said
the
old
man
when
they
hung
about
him
with
thanks
and
pretty
words
only
a
my
own
invention
so
they
went
home
and
were
married
and
the
princess
did
not
wear
a
veil
at
the
wedding
she
said
she
had
had
enough
veils
to
last
her
time
and
a
year
and
a
day
after
that
a
little
daughter
was
born
to
them
sweetheart
said
king
bellamant
he
was
king
now
because
the
old
king
and
queen
had
retired
from
the
business
and
were
keeping
pigs
and
hens
in
the
country
as
they
had
always
planned
to
do
sweetheart
and
life
love
i
am
going
to
ring
the
bells
with
my
own
hands
to
show
how
glad
i
am
for
you
and
for
the
child
and
for
our
good
life
together
so
he
went
out
it
was
very
dark
because
the
baby
princess
had
chosen
to
be
born
at
midnight
the
king
went
out
to
the
belfry
that
stood
in
the
great
bare
quiet
moonlit
square
and
he
opened
the
door
the
like
huge
caterpillars
hung
on
the
first
loft
the
king
began
to
climb
the
stone
stair
and
as
he
went
up
he
heard
a
noise
the
strangest
noises
stamping
and
rustling
and
deep
breathings
he
stood
still
in
the
ringers
loft
where
the
caterpillary
hung
and
from
the
belfry
above
he
heard
the
noise
of
strong
fighting
and
mixed
with
it
the
sound
of
voices
angry
and
desperate
but
with
a
noble
note
that
thrilled
the
soul
of
the
hearer
like
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
in
battle
and
the
voices
cried
down
down
away
away
when
good
has
come
ill
may
not
stay
out
out
into
the
night
the
belfry
bells
are
ours
by
right
and
the
words
broke
and
joined
again
like
water
when
it
flows
against
the
piers
of
a
bridge
down
may
not
stay
has
come
away
and
the
joining
came
like
the
sound
of
the
river
that
flows
free
again
out
out
into
the
night
the
belfry
bells
are
ours
by
right
and
then
as
king
bellamant
stood
there
thrilled
and
yet
as
it
were
turned
to
stone
by
the
magic
of
this
conflict
that
raged
above
him
there
came
a
sweeping
rush
down
the
belfry
ladder
the
lantern
he
carried
showed
him
a
rout
of
little
dark
evil
people
clothed
in
dust
and
cobwebs
that
scurried
down
the
wooden
steps
gnashing
their
teeth
and
growling
in
the
bitterness
of
a
deserved
defeat
they
passed
and
there
was
silence
then
the
king
flew
from
rope
to
rope
pulling
lustily
and
from
above
the
bells
answered
in
their
own
clear
beautiful
voices
because
the
good
had
driven
out
the
usurpers
and
had
come
to
their
own
again
ring
bell
a
little
baby
comes
on
earth
to
dwell
ring
bell
sound
bell
sound
swell
ring
for
joy
and
wish
her
well
may
her
life
tell
no
tale
of
ring
bell
joy
bell
love
bell
ring
i
do
see
said
king
bellamant
when
he
had
told
queen
belinda
all
about
it
it
was
that
i
came
to
hear
them
the
enchanter
of
the
ringing
well
said
that
only
lovers
could
hear
what
the
bells
had
to
say
and
then
only
when
they
were
together
silly
dear
boy
said
queen
belinda
cuddling
the
baby
princess
close
under
her
chin
lovers
are
we
and
you
do
suppose
i
was
with
you
when
you
went
to
ring
the
bells
for
our
baby
my
heart
and
soul
anyway
all
of
me
that
matters
said
the
king
course
you
were
that
accounts
viii
justnowland
no
no
no
i
will
be
good
oh
i
will
the
little
weak
voice
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
locked
attic
door
should
have
thought
of
that
before
said
the
strong
sharp
voice
outside
did
mean
to
be
naughty
i
did
truly
not
what
you
mean
miss
it
what
you
do
i
teach
you
not
to
mean
my
lady
the
bitter
irony
of
the
last
words
dried
the
child
tears
well
then
she
screamed
wo
be
good
i
wo
try
to
be
good
i
thought
you
like
your
nasty
old
garden
weeded
i
only
did
it
to
please
you
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
turnips
it
looked
just
like
weeds
then
came
a
pause
then
another
shriek
auntie
do
oh
let
me
out
let
me
out
not
let
you
out
till
i
broken
your
spirit
my
girl
you
may
rely
on
that
the
sharp
voice
stopped
abruptly
on
a
high
note
determined
feet
in
strong
boots
sounded
on
the
stairs
fainter
fainter
a
door
slammed
below
with
a
dreadful
definiteness
and
elsie
was
left
alone
to
wonder
how
soon
her
spirit
would
break
for
at
no
less
a
price
it
appeared
could
freedom
be
bought
the
outlook
seemed
hopeless
the
martyrs
and
heroines
with
whom
elsie
usually
identified
herself
spirit
had
never
been
broken
not
chains
nor
the
rack
nor
the
fiery
stake
itself
had
even
weakened
them
imprisonment
in
an
attic
would
to
them
have
been
luxury
compared
with
the
boiling
oil
and
the
smoking
faggots
and
all
the
intimate
cruelties
of
mysterious
instruments
of
steel
and
leather
in
cold
dungeons
lit
only
by
the
dull
flare
of
torches
and
the
bright
watchful
eyes
of
inquisitors
a
month
in
the
house
of
and
really
only
an
unrelated
staines
paid
to
take
care
of
the
child
had
held
but
one
interest
foxe
book
of
martyrs
it
was
a
horrible
book
the
thick
oleographs
their
guarding
sheets
of
tissue
paper
sticking
to
the
prints
like
bandages
to
a
wound
elsie
knew
all
about
wounds
she
had
had
one
herself
only
a
scalded
hand
it
is
true
but
a
wound
is
a
wound
all
the
world
over
it
was
a
book
that
made
you
afraid
to
go
to
bed
but
it
was
a
book
you
could
not
help
reading
and
now
it
seemed
as
though
it
might
at
last
help
and
not
merely
sicken
and
terrify
but
the
help
was
frail
and
broke
almost
instantly
on
the
thought
were
brave
because
they
were
good
how
can
i
be
brave
when
there
nothing
to
be
brave
about
except
me
not
knowing
the
difference
between
turnips
and
weeds
she
sank
down
a
huddled
black
bunch
on
the
bare
attic
floor
and
called
wildly
to
some
one
who
could
not
answer
her
her
frock
was
black
because
the
one
who
always
used
to
answer
could
not
answer
any
more
and
her
father
was
in
india
where
you
can
not
answer
or
even
hear
your
little
girl
however
much
she
cries
in
england
wo
cry
said
elsie
sobbing
as
violently
as
ever
can
be
brave
even
if
i
not
a
saint
but
only
a
i
be
a
bastille
prisoner
and
tame
a
mouse
she
dried
her
eyes
though
the
bosom
of
the
black
frock
still
heaved
like
the
sea
after
a
storm
and
looked
about
for
a
mouse
to
tame
one
could
not
begin
too
soon
but
unfortunately
there
seemed
to
be
no
mouse
at
liberty
just
then
there
were
right
enough
all
round
the
wainscot
and
in
the
broad
boards
of
the
old
floor
but
never
a
mouse
mouse
elsie
called
softly
mousie
come
and
be
tamed
not
a
mouse
replied
the
attic
was
perfectly
empty
and
dreadfully
clean
the
other
attic
elsie
knew
had
lots
of
interesting
things
in
it
old
furniture
and
saddles
and
sacks
of
seed
potatoes
but
in
this
attic
nothing
not
so
much
as
a
bit
of
string
on
the
floor
that
one
could
make
knots
in
or
twist
round
one
finger
till
it
made
the
red
ridges
that
are
so
interesting
to
look
at
afterwards
not
even
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
draughty
cold
fireplace
that
one
could
make
paper
boats
of
or
prick
letters
in
with
a
pin
or
the
tag
of
one
as
she
stooped
to
see
whether
under
the
grate
some
old
or
bit
of
twig
might
have
escaped
the
broom
she
saw
suddenly
what
she
had
wanted
most
a
mouse
it
was
lying
on
its
side
she
put
out
her
hand
very
slowly
and
gently
and
whispered
in
her
softest
tones
up
mousie
wake
up
and
come
and
be
tamed
but
the
mouse
never
moved
and
when
she
took
it
in
her
hand
it
was
cold
she
moaned
dead
and
now
i
can
never
tame
you
and
she
sat
on
the
cold
hearth
and
cried
again
with
the
dead
mouse
in
her
lap
cry
said
somebody
find
you
something
to
tame
if
you
really
want
it
elsie
started
and
saw
the
head
of
a
black
bird
peering
at
her
through
the
square
opening
that
leads
to
the
chimney
the
edges
of
him
looked
ragged
and
but
that
was
because
she
saw
him
through
tears
to
a
tearless
eye
he
was
black
and
very
smooth
and
sleek
she
said
and
nothing
more
so
said
the
bird
politely
are
surprised
to
hear
me
speak
but
your
surprise
will
be
of
course
much
less
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
really
a
prime
minister
condemned
by
an
enchanter
to
wear
the
form
of
a
crow
till
till
i
can
get
rid
of
it
said
elsie
indeed
said
the
crow
and
suddenly
grew
smaller
till
he
could
come
comfortably
through
the
square
opening
he
did
this
perched
on
the
top
bar
and
hopped
to
the
floor
and
there
he
got
bigger
and
bigger
and
bigger
and
bigger
and
bigger
elsie
had
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
then
a
black
little
girl
of
eight
and
of
the
usual
size
stood
face
to
face
with
a
crow
as
big
as
a
man
and
no
doubt
as
old
she
found
words
then
do
she
cried
get
any
bigger
i
ca
bear
it
ca
it
said
the
crow
kindly
that
all
right
i
thought
you
better
get
used
to
seeing
rather
large
crows
before
i
take
you
to
crownowland
we
are
all
there
a
crow
is
a
man
elsie
managed
to
say
yes
it
is
when
it
an
enchanted
crow
the
bird
replied
makes
all
the
difference
now
you
were
saying
you
wanted
to
tame
something
if
you
come
with
me
to
crownowland
i
show
you
something
worth
taming
a
nice
place
elsie
asked
cautiously
she
was
somehow
not
so
very
frightened
now
said
the
crow
perhaps
i
shall
like
it
so
much
i
want
to
be
taming
things
yes
you
will
when
you
know
how
much
depends
on
it
i
should
like
said
elsie
go
up
the
chimney
this
is
my
best
frock
of
course
but
still
so
said
the
crow
only
came
that
way
for
fun
and
because
i
can
fly
you
shall
go
in
by
the
chief
gate
of
the
kingdom
like
a
lady
do
come
but
elsie
still
hesitated
sort
of
thing
is
it
you
want
me
to
tame
she
said
doubtfully
the
enormous
crow
hesitated
a
sort
of
lizard
it
said
at
last
if
you
can
only
tame
it
so
that
it
will
do
what
you
tell
it
to
you
save
the
whole
kingdom
and
we
put
up
a
statue
to
you
but
not
in
the
people
park
unless
they
wish
it
the
bird
added
mysteriously
should
like
to
save
a
kingdom
said
elsie
i
like
lizards
seen
lots
of
them
in
india
you
come
said
the
crow
but
how
do
we
go
are
only
two
doors
out
of
this
world
into
another
said
the
crow
take
you
through
the
nearest
allow
me
it
put
its
wing
round
her
so
that
her
face
nestled
against
the
black
softness
of
the
feathers
it
was
warm
and
dark
and
sleepy
there
and
very
comfortable
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
swim
easily
in
a
soft
sea
of
dreams
then
with
a
little
shock
she
found
herself
standing
on
a
marble
terrace
looking
out
over
a
city
far
more
beautiful
and
wonderful
than
she
had
ever
seen
or
imagined
the
great
crow
was
by
her
side
it
said
pointing
with
the
longest
of
its
long
black
see
this
beautiful
city
said
elsie
course
i
do
i
hardly
like
to
tell
you
the
story
said
the
crow
a
long
time
ago
and
i
hope
you
wo
think
the
worse
of
us
because
we
really
very
sorry
you
really
sorry
said
elsie
primly
course
it
all
right
it
is
said
the
crow
see
the
great
square
down
there
elsie
looked
down
on
a
square
of
green
trees
broken
a
little
towards
the
middle
that
where
the
where
is
what
you
got
to
tame
you
know
what
did
you
do
that
was
wrong
were
unkind
said
the
crow
slowly
unjust
and
ungenerous
we
had
servants
and
workpeople
doing
everything
for
us
we
had
nothing
to
do
be
kind
and
we
were
me
said
elsie
feebly
had
several
warnings
said
the
crow
was
an
old
parchment
and
it
said
just
how
you
ought
to
behave
and
all
that
but
we
care
what
it
said
i
was
court
magician
as
well
as
prime
minister
and
i
ought
to
have
known
better
but
i
did
we
all
wore
and
high
hats
then
he
added
sadly
on
said
elsie
her
eyes
wandering
from
one
beautiful
building
to
another
of
the
many
that
nestled
among
the
trees
of
the
city
the
old
parchment
said
that
if
we
did
behave
well
our
bodies
would
grow
like
our
souls
but
we
did
think
so
and
then
all
in
a
minute
they
and
we
were
crows
and
our
bodies
were
as
black
as
our
souls
our
souls
are
quite
white
now
it
added
reassuringly
what
was
dreadful
thing
you
done
been
unkind
to
the
people
who
worked
for
us
not
given
them
enough
food
or
clothes
or
fire
and
at
last
we
took
away
even
their
play
there
was
a
big
park
that
the
people
played
in
and
we
built
a
wall
round
it
and
took
it
for
ourselves
and
the
king
was
going
to
set
a
statue
of
himself
up
in
the
middle
and
then
before
we
could
begin
to
enjoy
it
we
were
turned
into
big
black
crows
and
the
working
people
into
big
white
pigeons
and
can
go
where
they
like
but
we
have
to
stay
here
till
we
tamed
the
we
never
can
go
into
the
park
until
settled
the
thing
that
guards
it
and
that
thing
a
big
big
lizard
in
fact
it
a
cried
elsie
but
she
was
not
as
frightened
as
the
crow
seemed
to
expect
because
every
now
and
then
she
had
felt
sure
that
she
was
really
safe
in
her
own
bed
and
that
this
was
a
dream
it
was
not
a
dream
but
the
belief
that
it
was
made
her
very
brave
and
she
felt
quite
sure
that
she
could
settle
a
dragon
if
necessary
a
dream
dragon
that
is
and
the
rest
of
the
time
she
thought
about
foxe
book
of
martyrs
and
what
a
heroine
she
now
had
the
chance
to
be
want
me
to
kill
it
she
asked
no
to
tame
it
said
the
crow
tried
all
sorts
of
means
long
whips
like
people
tame
horses
with
and
bars
such
as
use
and
it
all
been
perfectly
useless
and
there
the
dragon
lives
and
will
live
till
some
one
can
tame
him
and
get
him
to
follow
them
like
a
tame
fawn
and
eat
out
of
their
hand
does
the
dragon
to
eat
elsie
asked
replied
the
other
in
an
uncomfortable
whisper
least
never
known
it
eat
anything
else
i
to
try
to
tame
it
elsie
asked
dear
no
said
the
crow
have
a
banquet
in
your
honour
and
you
shall
have
tea
with
the
princess
do
you
know
who
is
a
princess
and
who
not
if
you
all
crows
elsie
cried
do
you
know
one
human
being
from
another
the
crow
replied
come
on
to
the
palace
it
led
her
along
the
terrace
and
down
some
marble
steps
to
a
small
arched
door
tradesmen
entrance
it
explained
it
the
courtiers
are
crowding
in
by
the
front
door
then
through
long
corridors
and
passages
they
went
and
at
last
into
the
many
crows
stood
about
in
respectful
attitudes
on
the
golden
throne
leaning
a
gloomy
head
upon
the
first
joint
of
his
right
wing
the
sovereign
of
crownowland
was
musing
dejectedly
a
little
girl
of
about
elsie
age
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
nursing
a
handsome
doll
is
the
little
girl
elsie
asked
that
the
princess
the
prime
minister
crow
whispered
and
elsie
made
the
best
curtsey
she
could
think
of
in
such
a
hurry
was
wicked
enough
to
be
turned
into
a
crow
or
poor
enough
to
be
turned
into
a
pigeon
so
she
remains
a
dear
little
girl
just
as
she
always
was
the
princess
dropped
her
doll
and
ran
down
the
steps
of
the
throne
to
meet
elsie
dear
she
said
come
to
play
with
me
have
you
all
the
little
girls
i
used
to
play
with
have
turned
into
crows
and
their
beaks
are
awkward
at
doll
and
wings
are
no
good
to
nurse
dollies
with
let
have
a
doll
shall
we
we
elsie
looked
at
the
crow
king
who
nodded
his
head
hopelessly
so
hand
in
hand
they
went
i
wonder
whether
you
have
ever
had
the
run
of
a
perfectly
beautiful
palace
and
a
nursery
absolutely
crammed
with
all
the
toys
you
ever
had
or
wanted
to
have
dolls
houses
dolls
china
bricks
conjuring
tricks
pewter
and
any
number
of
dolls
all
most
agreeable
and
distinguished
if
you
have
you
may
perhaps
be
able
faintly
to
imagine
elsie
happiness
and
better
than
all
the
toys
was
the
princess
perdona
so
gentle
and
kind
and
jolly
full
of
ideas
for
games
and
surrounded
by
the
means
for
playing
them
think
of
it
after
that
bare
attic
with
not
even
a
bit
of
string
to
play
with
and
no
company
but
the
poor
little
dead
mouse
there
is
no
room
in
this
story
to
tell
you
of
all
the
games
they
had
i
can
only
say
that
the
time
went
by
so
quickly
that
they
never
noticed
it
going
and
were
amazed
when
the
crown
nursemaid
brought
in
the
royal
tea
was
a
beautiful
meal
with
pink
iced
cake
in
it
now
all
the
time
that
these
glorious
games
had
been
going
on
and
this
magnificent
tea
the
wisest
crows
of
crownowland
had
been
holding
a
council
they
had
decided
that
there
was
no
time
like
the
present
and
that
elsie
had
better
try
to
tame
the
dragon
soon
as
late
the
king
said
must
run
any
risks
a
guard
of
fifty
stalwart
crows
must
go
with
her
and
if
the
dragon
shows
the
least
temper
fifty
crows
must
throw
themselves
between
her
and
danger
even
if
it
cost
for
i
myself
will
lead
that
band
who
will
volunteer
volunteers
to
the
number
of
some
thousands
instantly
stepped
forward
and
the
field
marshal
selected
fifty
of
the
strongest
crows
and
then
in
the
pleasant
pinkness
of
the
sunset
elsie
was
led
out
on
to
the
palace
steps
where
the
king
made
a
speech
and
said
what
a
heroine
she
was
and
how
like
joan
of
arc
and
the
crows
who
had
gathered
from
all
parts
of
the
town
cheered
madly
did
you
ever
hear
crows
cheering
it
is
a
wonderful
sound
then
elsie
got
into
a
magnificent
gilt
coach
drawn
by
eight
white
horses
with
a
crow
at
the
head
of
each
horse
the
princess
sat
with
her
on
the
blue
velvet
cushions
and
held
her
hand
you
do
it
said
she
so
brave
and
clever
elsie
and
elsie
felt
braver
than
before
although
now
it
did
not
seem
so
like
a
dream
but
she
thought
of
the
martyrs
and
held
perdona
hand
very
tight
at
the
gates
of
the
green
park
the
princess
kissed
and
hugged
her
new
friend
her
state
crown
which
she
had
put
on
in
honour
of
the
occasion
got
pushed
quite
on
one
side
in
the
warmth
of
her
embrace
and
elsie
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
crows
round
the
park
gates
and
every
one
cheered
and
shouted
speech
elsie
got
as
far
as
and
gentlemen
crows
i
mean
and
then
she
could
not
think
of
anything
more
so
she
simply
added
ready
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
those
crows
cheer
but
elsie
would
have
the
escort
very
kind
she
said
the
dragon
only
eats
crows
and
i
not
a
crow
thank
goodness
i
mean
i
not
a
crow
and
if
i
got
to
be
brave
i
like
to
brave
and
none
of
you
to
get
eaten
if
only
some
one
will
come
with
me
to
show
me
the
way
and
then
run
back
as
hard
as
he
can
when
we
get
near
the
dragon
only
one
goes
shall
be
the
one
said
the
king
and
he
and
elsie
went
through
the
great
gates
side
by
side
she
held
the
end
of
his
wing
which
was
the
nearest
they
could
get
to
hand
in
hand
the
crowd
outside
waited
in
breathless
silence
elsie
and
the
king
went
on
through
the
winding
paths
of
the
people
park
and
by
the
winding
paths
they
came
at
last
to
the
dragon
he
lay
very
peacefully
on
a
great
stone
slab
his
enormous
wings
spread
out
on
the
grass
and
his
scales
glittering
in
the
pretty
pink
sunset
light
back
said
elsie
said
the
king
you
do
said
elsie
wo
go
seeing
a
crow
might
rouse
him
to
fury
or
give
him
an
appetite
or
something
do
do
go
so
he
went
but
not
far
he
hid
behind
a
tree
and
from
its
shelter
he
watched
elsie
drew
a
long
breath
her
heart
was
thumping
under
the
black
frock
she
thought
takes
me
for
a
crow
but
she
thought
how
yellow
her
hair
was
and
decided
that
the
dragon
would
be
certain
to
notice
that
march
she
said
to
herself
joan
of
arc
and
walked
right
up
to
the
dragon
it
never
moved
but
watched
her
suspiciously
out
of
its
bright
green
eyes
dear
she
said
in
her
clear
little
voice
said
the
dragon
in
tones
of
extreme
astonishment
dear
she
repeated
you
like
sugar
said
the
dragon
i
brought
you
some
you
wo
hurt
me
if
i
bring
it
to
you
the
dragon
violently
shook
its
vast
head
not
much
said
elsie
i
saved
it
at
four
lumps
two
for
each
of
my
mugs
of
milk
she
laid
the
sugar
on
the
stone
slab
by
the
dragon
paw
it
turned
its
head
towards
the
sugar
the
pinky
sunset
light
fell
on
its
face
and
elsie
saw
that
it
was
weeping
great
fat
tears
as
big
as
prize
pears
were
coursing
down
its
wrinkled
cheeks
do
said
elsie
cry
poor
dragon
what
the
matter
sobbed
the
dragon
only
so
glad
you
come
i
i
been
so
lonely
no
one
to
love
me
you
love
me
do
you
i
sure
i
shall
when
i
know
you
better
said
elsie
kindly
me
a
kiss
dear
said
the
dragon
sniffing
it
is
no
joke
to
kiss
a
dragon
but
elsie
did
it
somewhere
on
the
hard
green
wrinkles
of
its
forehead
you
said
the
dragon
brushing
away
its
tears
with
the
tip
of
its
tail
breaks
the
charm
i
can
move
now
and
i
got
back
all
my
lost
wisdom
come
along
i
want
my
tea
so
to
the
waiting
crowd
at
the
gate
came
elsie
and
the
dragon
side
by
side
and
at
sight
of
the
dragon
tamed
a
great
shout
went
up
from
the
crowd
and
at
that
shout
each
one
in
the
crowd
turned
quickly
to
the
next
one
for
it
was
the
shout
of
men
and
not
of
crows
because
at
the
first
sight
of
the
dragon
tamed
they
had
left
off
being
crows
for
ever
and
ever
and
once
again
were
men
the
king
came
running
through
the
gates
his
royal
robes
held
high
so
that
he
should
trip
over
them
and
he
too
was
no
longer
a
crow
but
a
man
and
what
did
elsie
feel
after
being
so
brave
well
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
cry
and
also
to
laugh
and
she
felt
that
she
loved
not
only
the
dragon
but
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
whole
world
even
staines
she
rode
back
to
the
palace
on
the
dragon
back
and
as
they
went
the
crowd
of
citizens
who
had
been
crows
met
the
crowd
of
citizens
who
had
been
pigeons
and
these
were
poor
men
in
poor
clothes
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
see
how
the
ones
who
had
been
rich
and
crows
ran
to
meet
the
ones
who
had
been
pigeons
and
poor
and
stay
at
my
house
brother
they
cried
to
those
who
had
no
homes
i
have
many
coats
come
and
choose
some
they
cried
to
the
ragged
and
feast
with
me
they
cried
to
all
and
the
rich
and
the
poor
went
off
arm
in
arm
to
feast
and
be
glad
that
night
and
the
next
day
to
work
side
by
side
said
the
king
speaking
with
his
hand
on
the
neck
of
the
tamed
dragon
land
has
been
called
crownowland
but
we
are
no
longer
crows
we
are
men
and
we
will
be
just
men
and
our
country
shall
be
called
justnowland
for
ever
and
ever
and
for
the
future
we
shall
not
be
rich
and
poor
but
and
each
will
do
his
best
for
his
brothers
and
his
own
city
and
your
king
shall
be
your
servant
i
do
know
how
they
managed
this
but
no
one
seemed
to
think
that
there
would
be
any
difficulty
about
it
when
the
king
mentioned
it
and
when
people
really
make
up
their
minds
to
do
anything
difficulties
do
most
oddly
disappear
wonderful
rejoicings
there
were
the
city
was
hung
with
flags
and
lamps
bands
played
the
performers
a
little
out
of
practice
because
of
course
crows
ca
play
the
flute
or
the
violin
or
the
trombone
but
the
effect
was
very
gay
indeed
then
came
the
time
it
was
quite
dark
when
the
king
rose
up
on
his
throne
and
spoke
and
elsie
among
all
her
new
friends
listened
with
them
to
his
words
deliverer
elsie
he
said
brought
hither
by
the
good
magic
of
our
chief
mage
and
prime
minister
she
has
removed
the
enchantment
that
held
us
and
the
dragon
now
that
he
has
had
his
tea
and
recovered
from
the
shock
of
being
kindly
treated
turns
out
to
be
the
second
strongest
magician
in
the
world
and
he
will
help
us
and
advise
us
so
long
as
we
remember
that
we
are
all
brothers
and
and
now
comes
the
time
when
our
elsie
must
return
to
her
own
place
or
another
go
in
her
stead
but
we
can
not
send
back
our
heroine
our
deliverer
loud
one
shall
take
her
place
my
daughter
the
end
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
shouts
of
admiration
but
elsie
stood
up
small
and
white
in
her
black
frock
and
said
thank
you
perdona
would
simply
hate
it
and
she
does
know
my
daddy
he
fetch
me
away
from
staines
some
day
the
thought
of
her
daddy
far
away
in
india
of
the
loneliness
of
willow
farm
where
now
it
would
be
night
in
that
horrible
bare
attic
where
the
poor
dead
untameable
little
mouse
was
nearly
choked
elsie
it
was
so
bright
and
light
and
good
and
kind
here
and
india
was
so
far
away
her
voice
stayed
a
moment
on
a
broken
note
i
then
she
spoke
firmly
you
all
so
much
she
said
very
much
i
do
love
you
all
and
it
lovely
here
but
please
i
like
to
go
home
now
the
prime
minister
in
a
silence
full
of
love
and
understanding
folded
his
dark
cloak
round
her
it
was
dark
in
the
attic
elsie
crouching
alone
in
the
blackness
by
the
fireplace
where
the
dead
mouse
had
been
put
out
her
hand
to
touch
its
cold
fur
there
were
wheels
on
the
gravel
outside
the
knocker
swung
strongly
a
pause
voices
hasty
feet
in
strong
boots
sounded
on
the
stairs
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
a
dazzling
crack
then
fully
to
the
glare
of
a
lamp
carried
by
staines
down
at
once
i
sure
you
good
now
she
said
in
a
great
hurry
and
in
a
new
honeyed
voice
but
there
were
other
feet
on
the
stairs
a
step
that
elsie
knew
my
girl
the
voice
she
knew
cried
cheerfully
but
under
the
cheerfulness
elsie
heard
something
other
and
dearer
my
girl
after
all
it
takes
less
than
a
month
to
come
from
india
to
the
house
in
england
where
one
heart
is
out
of
the
bare
attic
and
the
darkness
elsie
leapt
into
light
into
arms
she
knew
my
daddy
my
daddy
she
cried
glad
i
am
i
came
back
ix
the
related
muff
we
had
never
seen
our
cousin
sidney
till
that
christmas
eve
and
we
did
want
to
see
him
then
and
we
did
like
him
when
we
did
see
him
he
was
just
dumped
down
into
the
middle
of
us
by
mother
at
a
time
when
it
would
have
been
unkind
to
her
to
say
how
little
we
wanted
him
we
knew
already
that
there
was
to
be
any
proper
christmas
for
us
because
aunt
ellie
the
one
who
always
used
to
send
the
necklaces
and
carved
things
from
india
and
remembered
everybody
birthday
had
come
home
ill
very
ill
she
was
at
a
hotel
in
london
and
mother
had
to
go
to
her
and
of
course
father
was
away
with
his
ship
and
then
after
we
had
said
to
mother
and
told
her
how
sorry
we
were
we
were
left
to
ourselves
and
told
each
other
what
a
shame
it
was
and
no
presents
or
anything
and
then
mother
came
suddenly
back
in
a
cab
and
we
all
shouted
when
we
saw
the
cab
stop
and
her
get
out
of
it
and
then
we
saw
she
was
getting
something
out
of
the
cab
and
our
hearts
leapt
up
like
the
man
in
the
piece
of
school
poetry
when
he
beheld
a
rainbow
in
the
sky
because
we
thought
she
had
remembered
about
the
presents
and
the
thing
she
was
getting
out
of
the
cab
was
of
course
it
was
not
it
was
sidney
very
thin
and
yellow
and
looking
as
sullen
as
a
pig
we
opened
the
front
door
mother
did
even
come
in
she
just
said
your
cousin
sidney
be
nice
to
him
and
give
him
a
good
time
there
darlings
and
do
forget
he
your
visitor
so
be
very
extra
nice
to
him
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
was
the
fault
of
what
mother
said
about
the
visitor
that
made
what
did
happen
happen
but
i
am
almost
sure
really
that
it
was
the
fault
of
us
though
i
did
not
see
it
at
the
time
and
even
now
i
sure
we
did
mean
to
be
unkind
quite
the
opposite
but
the
events
of
life
are
very
confusing
especially
when
you
try
to
think
what
made
you
do
them
and
whether
you
really
meant
to
be
naughty
or
not
quite
often
it
is
not
but
it
turns
out
just
the
same
when
the
cab
had
carried
mother
away
hilda
said
it
was
like
a
dragon
carrying
away
a
queen
we
said
do
you
do
to
our
cousin
sidney
who
replied
well
thank
you
and
then
curiously
enough
no
one
could
think
of
anything
more
to
say
then
rupert
which
is
me
remembered
that
about
being
a
visitor
and
he
said
you
come
into
the
he
did
when
he
had
taken
off
his
gloves
and
overcoat
there
was
a
fire
in
the
because
we
had
been
going
to
have
games
there
with
mother
only
the
telegram
came
about
aunt
ellie
so
we
all
sat
on
chairs
in
the
and
thought
of
nothing
to
say
harder
than
ever
hilda
did
say
old
are
you
but
of
course
we
knew
the
answer
to
that
it
was
ten
and
hugh
said
you
like
england
or
india
best
and
our
cousin
replied
ever
so
much
thank
you
i
never
felt
such
a
duffer
it
was
awful
with
all
the
millions
of
interesting
things
that
there
are
to
say
at
other
times
and
i
think
of
one
at
last
i
said
you
like
games
illustration
so
we
all
sat
on
chairs
in
the
and
thought
of
nothing
to
say
harder
than
ever
and
our
cousin
replied
games
i
do
in
a
tone
that
made
me
sure
that
the
games
he
liked
would
be
our
kind
but
some
wild
indian
sort
that
we
did
know
i
could
see
that
the
others
were
feeling
just
like
me
and
i
knew
we
could
not
go
on
like
this
till
and
yet
i
did
see
any
other
way
to
go
on
in
it
was
hilda
who
cut
the
gorgeous
knot
at
last
she
said
let
you
and
i
go
and
make
a
lovely
surprise
for
rupert
and
sidney
and
before
i
could
think
of
any
way
of
stopping
them
without
being
downright
rude
to
our
new
cousin
they
had
fled
the
scene
just
like
any
old
conspirators
rupert
me
i
mean
was
left
alone
with
the
stranger
i
said
there
anything
you
like
to
do
and
he
said
thank
you
then
neither
of
us
said
anything
for
a
bit
and
i
could
hear
the
others
shrieking
with
laughter
in
the
hall
i
said
wonder
what
the
surprise
will
be
like
he
said
i
wonder
but
i
could
tell
from
his
tone
that
he
did
not
wonder
a
bit
the
others
were
yelling
with
laughter
have
you
ever
noticed
how
very
amused
people
always
are
when
you
not
there
if
you
in
bed
ill
or
in
disgrace
or
anything
it
always
sounds
like
far
finer
jokes
than
ever
occur
when
you
are
not
out
of
things
you
like
reading
said
i
who
am
rupert
in
the
tones
of
despair
said
the
cousin
take
a
book
i
said
hastily
for
i
really
could
not
stand
it
another
second
you
just
read
till
the
surprise
is
ready
i
think
i
ought
to
go
and
help
the
others
i
the
eldest
you
know
i
did
not
wait
i
suppose
if
you
ten
you
can
choose
a
book
for
yourself
and
i
went
hilda
idea
was
just
indians
but
i
thought
a
wigwam
would
be
nice
so
we
made
one
with
the
hall
table
and
the
fur
rugs
off
the
floor
if
everything
had
been
different
and
aunt
ellie
had
been
ill
we
were
to
have
had
turkey
for
dinner
the
turkey
feathers
were
splendid
for
indians
and
the
striped
blankets
off
hugh
and
my
beds
and
all
mother
beads
the
hall
is
big
like
a
room
and
there
was
a
fire
the
afternoon
passed
like
a
beautiful
dream
when
rupert
had
done
his
own
feathering
and
blanketing
as
well
as
brown
paper
moccasins
he
helped
the
others
the
rang
before
we
were
quite
dressed
we
got
louisa
to
go
up
and
tell
our
cousin
that
the
surprise
was
ready
and
we
all
got
inside
the
wigwam
it
was
a
very
tight
fit
with
the
feathers
and
the
blankets
he
came
down
the
stairs
very
slowly
reading
all
the
time
and
when
he
got
to
the
mat
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
we
burst
forth
in
all
our
from
the
wigwam
it
upset
because
hugh
and
hilda
stuck
between
the
table
legs
and
it
fell
on
the
stone
floor
with
quite
a
loud
noise
the
wild
indians
picked
themselves
up
out
of
the
ruins
and
did
the
finest
i
ever
seen
in
front
of
my
cousin
sidney
he
gave
one
little
scream
and
then
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
bottom
steps
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
banisters
and
we
thought
he
was
admiring
the
till
eliza
who
had
been
laughing
and
making
as
much
noise
as
any
one
suddenly
went
up
to
him
and
shook
him
that
noise
she
said
to
us
gone
off
into
a
dead
faint
he
had
of
course
we
were
very
sorry
and
all
that
but
we
never
thought
he
be
such
a
muff
as
to
be
frightened
of
three
red
indians
and
a
wigwam
that
happened
to
upset
he
was
put
to
bed
and
we
had
our
teas
wish
we
had
hilda
said
do
i
said
hugh
but
rupert
said
one
have
expected
a
cousin
of
ours
to
be
a
duffer
he
a
muff
it
bad
enough
to
have
a
muff
in
the
house
at
all
and
at
christmas
time
too
but
a
related
muff
still
the
affair
had
cast
a
gloom
and
we
were
glad
when
it
was
next
day
was
christmas
day
and
no
presents
and
nobody
but
the
servants
to
wish
a
merry
christmas
to
our
cousin
sidney
came
down
to
breakfast
and
as
it
was
christmas
day
rupert
bent
his
proud
spirit
to
own
he
was
sorry
about
the
indians
sidney
said
does
matter
i
sorry
too
only
i
did
expect
it
we
suggested
two
or
three
games
such
as
parlour
cricket
national
gallery
and
grab
but
sidney
said
he
would
rather
read
so
we
said
would
he
mind
if
we
played
out
the
indian
game
which
we
had
dropped
out
of
politeness
when
he
fainted
he
said
do
mind
at
all
now
i
know
what
it
is
you
up
to
no
thank
you
i
rather
read
he
added
in
reply
to
rupert
unselfish
offer
to
dress
him
for
the
part
of
sitting
bull
so
he
read
and
we
fought
on
the
stairs
with
no
casualties
except
the
gas
globes
and
then
we
scalped
all
the
dolls
putting
on
paper
scalps
first
because
hilda
wished
it
and
we
scalped
eliza
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
hers
was
a
white
scalp
with
lacey
stuff
on
it
and
long
streamers
illustration
scalped
eliza
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
and
when
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
we
thought
of
flying
machines
of
course
sidney
would
play
at
that
either
and
hilda
and
hugh
were
contented
with
paper
wings
there
were
some
rolls
of
rather
decent
yellow
and
pink
crinkled
paper
that
mother
had
bought
to
make
lamp
shades
of
they
made
wings
of
this
and
then
they
played
at
fairies
up
and
down
the
stairs
while
sidney
sat
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
went
on
reading
but
rupert
was
determined
to
have
a
flying
machine
with
real
wings
like
at
hendon
so
he
got
two
brass
out
of
the
spare
room
and
mother
bedroom
and
covered
them
with
newspapers
fastened
on
with
string
then
he
got
a
and
fastened
it
on
to
himself
with
and
then
he
slipped
his
arms
in
between
the
string
and
the
and
went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
shouting
out
below
there
beware
flying
machines
he
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
tray
and
tobogganed
gloriously
down
the
stairs
flapping
his
wings
it
was
a
great
success
and
felt
more
like
flying
than
anything
he
ever
played
at
but
hilda
had
not
had
time
to
look
out
thoroughly
because
he
did
not
wait
any
time
between
his
warning
and
his
descent
so
that
she
was
still
fluttering
in
the
character
of
queen
of
the
butterfly
fairies
about
down
the
stairs
when
the
flying
machine
composed
of
the
two
guards
the
and
rupert
started
from
the
top
of
them
and
she
could
only
get
out
of
the
way
by
standing
back
close
against
the
wall
unluckily
the
place
where
she
was
was
also
the
place
where
the
gas
was
burning
in
a
little
recess
you
remember
we
had
broken
the
globe
when
we
were
playing
indians
now
of
course
you
know
what
happened
because
you
have
read
and
the
and
all
the
rest
of
the
stories
that
have
been
written
to
persuade
children
not
to
play
with
fire
no
one
was
playing
with
fire
that
day
it
is
true
or
doing
anything
really
naughty
at
all
but
however
naughty
we
had
been
the
thing
that
happened
could
have
been
much
worse
for
the
flying
machine
as
it
came
rushing
round
the
curve
of
the
staircase
banged
against
the
legs
of
hilda
she
screamed
and
stumbled
back
her
pink
paper
wings
went
into
the
gas
that
had
a
globe
they
flamed
up
her
hair
frizzled
and
her
lace
collar
caught
fire
rupert
could
not
do
anything
because
he
was
held
fast
in
his
flying
machine
and
he
and
it
were
rolling
painfully
on
the
mat
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
illustration
sidney
threw
the
rug
over
her
and
rolled
her
over
and
over
hilda
screamed
i
have
since
heard
that
a
great
yellow
light
fell
on
the
pages
of
next
moment
went
spinning
across
the
room
sidney
caught
up
the
fur
rug
that
was
part
of
the
wigwam
and
as
hilda
screaming
horribly
and
with
wings
not
of
paper
but
of
flames
rushed
down
the
staircase
and
stumbled
over
the
flying
machine
sidney
threw
the
rug
over
her
and
rolled
her
over
and
over
on
the
floor
down
he
cried
down
it
the
only
way
but
somehow
people
never
will
lie
down
when
their
clothes
are
on
fire
any
more
than
they
will
lie
still
in
the
water
if
they
think
they
are
drowning
and
some
one
is
trying
to
save
them
it
came
to
something
very
like
a
fight
hilda
fought
and
struggled
rupert
got
out
of
his
and
added
himself
and
his
to
the
scrimmage
hugh
slid
down
to
the
knob
of
the
banisters
and
sat
there
yelling
the
servants
came
rushing
in
but
by
that
time
the
fire
was
out
and
sidney
gasped
out
all
right
you
are
burned
hilda
are
you
hilda
was
much
too
frightened
to
know
whether
she
was
burnt
or
not
but
eliza
looked
her
over
and
it
turned
out
that
only
her
neck
was
a
little
scorched
and
a
good
deal
of
her
hair
frizzled
off
short
every
one
stood
rather
breathless
and
pale
and
every
one
face
was
much
dirtier
than
customary
except
hugh
which
he
had
as
usual
dirtied
thoroughly
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
rupert
felt
perfectly
awful
ashamed
and
proud
and
rather
sick
a
regular
hero
sidney
he
said
and
it
was
not
easy
to
say
yesterday
i
said
you
were
a
related
muff
and
i
jolly
sorry
i
did
shake
hands
wo
you
sidney
hesitated
proud
rupert
feelings
were
hurt
and
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
spoke
rather
fiercely
it
a
little
burnt
i
think
said
sidney
be
angry
and
he
held
out
the
left
hand
rupert
grasped
it
do
beg
your
pardon
he
said
a
hero
sidney
hand
was
bad
for
ever
so
long
but
we
were
tremendous
chums
after
that
it
was
when
they
done
the
hand
up
with
scraped
potato
and
salad
oil
a
great
big
fat
wet
plaster
of
it
that
i
said
to
him
do
care
if
you
do
like
games
let
be
pals
and
he
said
do
like
games
but
i
could
care
about
anything
with
mother
so
ill
i
know
you
think
i
a
muff
but
i
not
really
only
i
do
love
her
so
and
with
that
he
began
to
cry
and
i
thumped
him
on
the
back
and
told
him
exactly
what
a
beast
i
knew
i
was
to
comfort
him
when
aunt
ellie
was
well
again
we
kept
christmas
on
the
of
january
which
used
to
be
christmas
day
in
times
father
came
home
before
new
year
and
he
had
a
silver
medal
made
with
a
flame
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
sidney
name
and
bravery
if
i
had
not
been
tied
up
in
and
perhaps
i
should
have
thought
of
the
rug
and
got
the
medal
but
i
do
not
grudge
it
to
sidney
he
deserved
it
and
he
is
not
a
muff
i
see
now
that
a
person
might
very
well
be
frightened
at
finding
indians
in
the
hall
of
a
strange
house
especially
if
the
person
had
just
come
from
the
kind
of
india
where
the
indians
are
quite
a
different
sort
and
much
milder
with
no
feathers
and
wigwams
and
but
only
dusky
features
and
university
degrees
x
the
aunt
and
amabel
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
a
fish
out
of
water
to
be
a
cat
in
water
is
not
what
any
one
would
desire
to
be
in
a
temper
is
uncomfortable
and
no
one
can
fully
taste
the
joys
of
life
if
he
is
in
a
little
lord
fauntleroy
suit
but
by
far
the
most
uncomfortable
thing
to
be
in
is
disgrace
sometimes
amusingly
called
coventry
by
the
people
who
are
not
in
it
we
have
all
been
there
it
is
a
place
where
the
heart
sinks
and
aches
where
familiar
faces
are
clouded
and
changed
where
any
remark
that
one
may
tremblingly
make
is
received
with
stony
silence
or
with
the
assurance
that
nobody
wants
to
talk
to
such
a
naughty
child
if
you
are
only
in
disgrace
and
not
in
solitary
confinement
you
will
creep
about
a
house
that
is
like
the
one
you
have
had
such
jolly
times
in
and
yet
as
unlike
it
as
a
bad
dream
is
to
a
june
morning
you
will
long
to
speak
to
people
and
be
afraid
to
speak
you
will
wonder
whether
there
is
anything
you
can
do
that
will
change
things
at
all
you
have
said
you
are
sorry
and
that
has
changed
nothing
you
will
wonder
whether
you
are
to
stay
for
ever
in
this
desolate
place
outside
all
hope
and
love
and
fun
and
happiness
and
though
it
has
happened
before
and
has
always
in
the
end
come
to
an
end
you
can
never
be
quite
sure
that
this
time
it
is
not
going
to
last
for
ever
going
to
last
for
ever
said
amabel
who
was
eight
shall
i
do
oh
whatever
shall
i
do
what
she
done
ought
to
have
formed
the
subject
of
her
meditations
and
she
had
done
what
had
seemed
to
her
all
the
time
and
in
fact
still
seemed
a
and
noble
act
she
was
staying
with
an
aunt
measles
or
a
new
baby
or
the
painters
in
the
house
i
forget
which
the
cause
of
her
banishment
and
the
aunt
who
was
really
a
and
quite
old
enough
to
know
better
had
been
grumbling
about
her
head
gardener
to
a
lady
who
called
in
blue
spectacles
and
a
beady
bonnet
with
violet
flowers
in
it
hardly
lets
me
have
a
plant
for
the
table
said
the
aunt
that
border
in
front
of
the
window
it
just
bare
earth
and
i
expressly
ordered
chrysanthemums
to
be
planted
there
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
greenhouse
the
lady
snorted
and
said
she
did
know
what
we
were
coming
to
and
she
would
have
just
half
a
cup
please
with
not
quite
so
much
milk
thank
you
very
much
now
what
would
you
have
done
minded
your
own
business
most
likely
and
not
got
into
trouble
at
all
not
so
amabel
enthusiastically
anxious
to
do
something
which
should
make
the
see
what
a
thoughtful
unselfish
little
girl
she
really
was
the
aunt
opinion
of
her
being
at
present
quite
otherwise
she
got
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
took
the
scissors
from
the
table
drawer
and
stole
an
errand
of
mercy
she
told
herself
to
the
greenhouse
where
she
busily
snipped
off
every
single
flower
she
could
find
macfarlane
was
at
his
breakfast
then
with
the
points
of
the
scissors
she
made
nice
deep
little
holes
in
the
where
the
chrysanthemums
ought
to
have
been
and
struck
the
flowers
in
chrysanthemums
geraniums
primulas
orchids
and
carnations
it
would
be
a
lovely
surprise
for
auntie
then
the
aunt
came
down
to
breakfast
and
saw
the
lovely
surprise
amabel
world
turned
upside
down
and
inside
out
suddenly
and
surprisingly
and
there
she
was
in
coventry
and
not
even
the
housemaid
would
speak
to
her
her
whom
she
passed
in
the
hall
on
her
way
to
her
own
room
did
indeed
as
he
smoothed
his
hat
murmur
to
coventry
eh
never
mind
it
soon
be
over
and
went
off
to
the
city
banging
the
front
door
behind
him
he
meant
well
but
he
did
not
understand
amabel
understood
or
she
thought
she
did
and
knew
in
her
miserable
heart
that
she
was
sent
to
coventry
for
the
last
time
and
that
this
time
she
would
stay
there
do
care
she
said
quite
untruly
never
try
to
be
kind
to
any
one
again
and
that
was
true
either
she
was
to
spend
the
whole
day
alone
in
the
best
bedroom
the
one
with
the
bed
and
the
red
curtains
and
the
large
wardrobe
with
a
in
it
that
you
could
see
yourself
in
to
the
very
ends
of
your
the
first
thing
amabel
did
was
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
was
still
sniffing
and
sobbing
and
her
eyes
were
swimming
in
tears
another
one
rolled
down
her
nose
as
she
looked
that
was
very
interesting
another
rolled
down
and
that
was
the
last
because
as
soon
as
you
get
interested
in
watching
your
tears
they
stop
next
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
decorated
just
as
she
had
left
it
very
bright
and
beautiful
it
look
nice
she
said
do
care
what
they
say
then
she
looked
round
the
room
for
something
to
read
there
was
nothing
the
best
bedrooms
never
did
have
anything
only
on
the
large
on
the
side
of
the
oval
was
one
book
covered
in
red
velvet
and
on
it
very
twistily
embroidered
in
yellow
silk
and
mixed
up
with
misleading
leaves
and
squiggles
were
the
letters
it
a
picture
alphabet
said
mabel
and
was
quite
pleased
though
of
course
she
was
much
too
old
to
care
for
alphabets
only
when
one
is
very
unhappy
and
very
dull
anything
is
better
than
nothing
she
opened
the
book
it
only
a
she
said
suppose
it
for
people
when
they
want
to
go
away
and
auntie
puts
it
here
in
case
they
suddenly
make
up
their
minds
to
go
and
feel
that
they
ca
wait
another
minute
i
feel
like
that
only
it
no
good
and
i
expect
other
people
do
too
she
had
learned
how
to
use
the
dictionary
and
this
seemed
to
go
the
same
way
she
looked
up
the
names
of
all
the
places
she
brighton
where
she
had
once
spent
a
month
rugby
where
her
brother
was
at
school
and
home
which
was
amberley
and
she
saw
the
times
when
the
trains
left
for
these
places
and
wished
she
could
go
by
those
trains
and
once
more
she
looked
round
the
best
bedroom
which
was
her
prison
and
thought
of
the
bastille
and
wished
she
had
a
toad
to
tame
like
the
poor
viscount
or
a
flower
to
watch
growing
like
picciola
and
she
was
very
sorry
for
herself
and
very
angry
with
her
aunt
and
very
grieved
at
the
conduct
of
her
parents
she
had
expected
better
things
from
them
and
now
they
had
left
her
in
this
dreadful
place
where
no
one
loved
her
and
no
one
understood
her
there
seemed
to
be
no
place
for
toads
or
flowers
in
the
best
room
it
was
carpeted
all
over
even
in
its
least
noticeable
corners
it
had
everything
a
best
room
ought
to
have
and
everything
was
of
dark
shining
mahogany
the
had
a
set
of
red
and
gold
glass
things
a
tray
candlesticks
a
many
little
pots
with
lids
and
two
bottles
with
stoppers
when
the
stoppers
were
taken
out
they
smelt
very
strange
something
like
very
old
scent
and
something
like
cold
cream
also
very
old
and
something
like
going
to
the
dentist
i
do
not
know
whether
the
scent
of
those
bottles
had
anything
to
do
with
what
happened
it
certainly
was
a
very
extraordinary
scent
quite
different
from
any
perfume
that
i
smell
nowadays
but
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
smelt
it
quite
often
but
then
there
are
no
best
rooms
now
such
as
there
used
to
be
the
best
rooms
now
are
gay
with
chintz
and
mirrors
and
there
are
always
flowers
and
books
and
little
tables
to
put
your
teacup
on
and
sofas
and
armchairs
and
they
smell
of
varnish
and
new
furniture
when
amabel
had
sniffed
at
both
bottles
and
looked
in
all
the
pots
which
were
quite
clean
and
empty
except
for
a
pearl
button
and
two
pins
in
one
of
them
she
took
up
the
again
to
look
for
whitby
where
her
godmother
lived
and
it
was
then
that
she
saw
the
extraordinary
name
this
was
odd
but
the
name
of
the
station
from
which
it
started
was
still
more
extraordinary
for
it
was
not
euston
or
cannon
street
or
marylebone
the
name
of
the
station
was
and
below
this
name
really
quite
unusual
for
a
station
amabel
read
in
small
letters
fares
strictly
forbidden
return
tickets
no
class
nuppence
trains
leave
all
the
time
and
under
that
in
still
smaller
letters
had
better
go
what
would
you
have
done
rubbed
your
eyes
and
thought
you
were
dreaming
well
if
you
had
nothing
more
would
have
happened
nothing
ever
does
when
you
behave
like
that
amabel
was
wiser
she
went
straight
to
the
big
wardrobe
and
turned
its
glass
handle
expect
it
only
shelves
and
people
best
hats
she
said
but
she
only
said
it
people
often
say
what
they
do
mean
so
that
if
things
turn
out
as
they
do
expect
they
can
say
told
you
so
but
this
is
most
dishonest
to
one
self
and
being
dishonest
to
one
self
is
almost
worse
than
being
dishonest
to
other
people
amabel
would
never
have
done
it
if
she
had
been
herself
but
she
was
out
of
herself
with
anger
and
unhappiness
of
course
it
was
hats
it
was
most
amazingly
a
crystal
cave
very
oddly
shaped
like
a
railway
station
it
seemed
to
be
lighted
by
stars
which
is
of
course
unusual
in
a
booking
office
and
over
the
station
clock
was
a
full
moon
the
clock
had
no
figures
only
in
shining
letters
all
round
it
twelve
times
and
the
touched
so
the
clock
was
bound
to
be
always
right
how
different
from
the
clock
you
go
to
school
by
a
porter
in
white
satin
hurried
forward
to
take
amabel
luggage
her
luggage
was
the
which
she
still
held
in
her
hand
of
time
miss
he
said
grinning
in
a
most
friendly
way
glad
you
going
you
enjoy
yourself
what
a
nice
little
girl
you
are
this
was
cheering
amabel
smiled
at
the
that
tickets
come
out
of
another
person
also
in
white
satin
was
ready
with
a
ticket
round
like
a
card
counter
you
are
miss
he
said
with
the
kindest
smile
nothing
and
refreshments
free
all
the
way
it
a
pleasure
he
added
issue
a
ticket
to
a
nice
little
lady
like
you
the
train
was
entirely
of
crystal
too
and
the
cushions
were
of
white
satin
there
were
little
buttons
such
as
you
have
for
electric
bells
and
on
them
in
silver
letters
amabel
pressed
all
the
buttons
at
once
and
instantly
felt
obliged
to
blink
the
blink
over
she
saw
on
the
cushion
by
her
side
a
silver
tray
with
vanilla
ice
boiled
chicken
and
white
sauce
almonds
blanched
peppermint
creams
and
mashed
potatoes
and
a
long
glass
of
lemonade
beside
the
tray
was
a
book
it
was
ewing
and
it
was
bound
in
white
vellum
there
is
nothing
more
luxurious
than
eating
while
you
read
unless
it
be
reading
while
you
eat
amabel
did
both
they
are
not
the
same
thing
as
you
will
see
if
you
think
the
matter
over
and
just
as
the
last
thrill
of
the
last
spoonful
of
ice
died
away
and
the
last
full
stop
of
the
met
amabel
eye
the
train
stopped
and
hundreds
of
railway
officials
in
white
velvet
shouted
get
out
a
velvety
porter
who
was
somehow
like
a
silkworm
as
well
as
like
a
wedding
handkerchief
sachet
opened
the
door
he
said
on
out
miss
amabel
unless
you
want
to
go
to
she
hurried
out
on
to
an
ivory
platform
on
the
ivory
if
you
please
said
the
porter
white
axminster
carpet
it
laid
down
expressly
for
you
amabel
walked
along
it
and
saw
ahead
of
her
a
crowd
all
in
white
all
that
she
asked
the
friendly
porter
the
mayor
dear
miss
amabel
he
said
your
address
address
is
the
old
cottage
amberley
she
said
least
it
used
to
be
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
mayor
he
was
very
like
uncle
george
but
he
bowed
low
to
her
which
was
not
uncle
habit
and
said
dear
little
amabel
please
accept
this
admiring
address
from
the
mayor
and
burgesses
and
apprentices
and
all
the
rest
of
it
of
whereyouwantogoto
the
address
was
in
silver
letters
on
white
silk
and
it
said
dear
amabel
we
know
you
meant
to
please
your
aunt
it
was
very
clever
of
you
to
think
of
putting
the
greenhouse
flowers
in
the
bare
you
could
be
expected
to
know
that
you
ought
to
ask
leave
before
you
touch
other
people
things
but
said
amabel
quite
confused
did
but
the
band
struck
up
and
drowned
her
words
the
instruments
of
the
band
were
all
of
silver
and
the
bandsmen
clothes
of
white
leather
the
tune
they
played
was
then
amabel
found
that
she
was
taking
part
in
a
procession
hand
in
hand
with
the
mayor
and
the
band
playing
like
mad
all
the
time
the
mayor
was
dressed
entirely
in
cloth
of
silver
and
as
they
went
along
he
kept
saying
close
to
her
ear
have
our
sympathy
you
have
our
sympathy
till
she
felt
quite
giddy
there
was
a
flower
show
all
the
flowers
were
white
there
was
a
concert
all
the
tunes
were
old
ones
there
was
a
play
called
yourself
in
her
and
there
was
a
banquet
with
amabel
in
the
place
of
honour
they
drank
her
health
in
white
wine
whey
and
then
through
the
crystal
hall
of
a
thousand
gleaming
pillars
where
thousands
of
guests
all
in
white
were
met
to
do
honour
to
amabel
the
shout
went
up
speech
i
can
not
explain
to
you
what
had
been
going
on
in
amabel
mind
perhaps
you
know
whatever
it
was
it
began
like
a
very
tiny
butterfly
in
a
box
that
could
not
keep
quiet
but
fluttered
and
fluttered
and
fluttered
and
when
the
mayor
rose
and
said
amabel
you
whom
we
all
love
and
understand
dear
amabel
you
who
were
so
unjustly
punished
for
trying
to
give
pleasure
to
an
unresponsive
aunt
poor
innocent
amabel
blameless
suffering
amabel
we
await
your
words
that
fluttering
tiresome
inside
her
seemed
suddenly
to
swell
to
the
size
and
strength
of
a
fluttering
albatross
and
amabel
got
up
from
her
seat
of
honour
on
the
throne
of
ivory
and
silver
and
pearl
and
said
choking
a
little
and
extremely
red
about
the
ears
and
gentlemen
i
do
want
to
make
a
speech
i
just
want
to
say
thank
you
and
to
say
to
say
to
say
she
stopped
and
all
the
white
crowd
cheered
say
she
went
on
as
the
cheers
died
down
i
was
blameless
and
innocent
and
all
those
nice
things
i
ought
to
have
thought
and
they
auntie
flowers
but
i
did
want
to
please
her
it
all
so
mixed
oh
i
wish
auntie
was
here
and
instantly
auntie
there
very
tall
and
quite
in
a
white
velvet
dress
and
an
ermine
cloak
cried
the
crowd
from
auntie
auntie
stood
on
the
step
of
the
throne
beside
amabel
and
said
think
perhaps
i
was
hasty
and
i
think
amabel
meant
to
please
me
but
all
the
flowers
that
were
meant
for
the
winter
well
i
was
annoyed
i
sorry
auntie
so
am
i
so
am
i
cried
amabel
and
the
two
began
to
hug
each
other
on
the
ivory
step
while
the
crowd
cheered
like
mad
and
the
band
struck
up
that
air
you
only
understood
auntie
said
amabel
among
hugs
is
such
a
lovely
place
come
and
see
everything
we
may
may
we
she
asked
the
mayor
place
is
yours
he
said
now
you
can
see
many
things
that
you
could
see
before
we
are
the
people
who
understand
and
now
you
are
one
of
us
and
your
aunt
is
another
i
must
not
tell
you
all
that
they
saw
because
these
things
are
secrets
only
known
to
the
people
who
understand
and
perhaps
you
do
not
yet
belong
to
that
happy
nation
and
if
you
do
you
will
know
without
my
telling
you
and
when
it
grew
late
and
the
stars
were
drawn
down
somehow
to
hang
among
the
trees
amabel
fell
asleep
in
her
aunt
arms
beside
a
white
foaming
fountain
on
a
marble
terrace
where
white
peacocks
came
to
drink
she
awoke
on
the
big
bed
in
the
spare
room
but
her
aunt
arms
were
still
round
her
she
was
saying
auntie
said
amabel
sleepily
am
so
sorry
it
stupid
of
me
and
i
did
mean
to
please
you
stupid
of
you
said
the
aunt
i
am
sure
you
meant
to
please
me
come
down
to
supper
and
amabel
has
a
confused
recollection
of
her
aunt
saying
that
she
was
sorry
adding
little
amabel
if
the
aunt
really
did
say
it
it
was
fine
of
her
and
amabel
is
quite
sure
that
she
did
say
it
amabel
and
her
are
now
the
best
of
friends
but
neither
of
them
has
ever
spoken
to
the
other
of
the
beautiful
city
called
amabel
is
too
shy
to
be
the
first
to
mention
it
and
no
doubt
the
aunt
has
her
own
reasons
for
not
broaching
the
subject
but
of
course
they
both
know
that
they
have
been
there
together
and
it
is
easy
to
get
on
with
people
when
you
and
they
alike
belong
to
the
if
you
look
in
the
that
your
people
have
you
will
not
find
it
is
only
in
the
red
velvet
bound
copy
that
amabel
found
in
her
aunt
best
bedroom
xi
kenneth
and
the
carp
kenneth
cousins
had
often
stayed
with
him
but
he
had
never
till
now
stayed
with
them
and
you
know
how
different
everything
is
when
you
are
in
your
own
house
you
are
certain
exactly
what
games
the
dislike
and
what
games
they
will
not
notice
also
what
sort
of
mischief
is
looked
over
and
what
sort
is
not
and
being
accustomed
to
your
own
sort
of
you
can
always
be
pretty
sure
when
you
are
likely
to
catch
it
whereas
strange
houses
are
in
this
matter
of
catching
it
full
of
the
most
unpleasing
surprises
you
know
all
this
but
kenneth
did
not
and
still
less
did
he
know
what
were
the
sort
of
things
which
in
his
cousins
house
led
to
disapproval
punishment
scoldings
in
short
to
catching
it
so
that
that
business
of
cousin
ethel
which
is
where
this
story
ought
to
begin
was
really
not
kenneth
fault
at
all
though
for
a
time
but
i
am
getting
on
too
fast
kenneth
cousins
were
four
conrad
alison
george
and
ethel
the
three
first
were
natural
sort
of
cousins
somewhere
near
his
own
age
but
ethel
was
hardly
like
a
cousin
at
all
more
like
an
aunt
because
she
was
she
wore
long
dresses
and
all
her
hair
on
the
top
of
her
head
a
mass
of
combs
and
hairpins
in
fact
she
had
just
had
her
birthday
with
iced
cakes
and
a
party
and
lots
of
presents
most
of
them
jewelry
and
that
brings
me
again
to
that
affair
of
the
or
would
bring
me
if
i
were
not
determined
to
tell
things
in
their
proper
order
which
is
the
first
duty
of
a
kenneth
home
was
in
kent
a
wooden
house
among
cherry
orchards
and
the
nearest
river
five
miles
away
that
was
why
he
looked
forward
in
such
a
very
extra
and
excited
way
to
his
visit
to
his
cousins
their
house
was
very
old
red
brick
with
ivy
all
over
it
it
had
a
secret
staircase
only
the
secret
was
not
kept
any
longer
and
the
housemaids
carried
pails
and
brooms
up
and
down
the
staircase
and
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
real
deep
moat
with
clear
water
in
it
and
long
weeds
and
and
fish
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
the
everyday
kinds
illustration
early
next
morning
he
tried
to
catch
fish
with
several
pieces
of
string
knotted
together
and
a
hairpin
the
first
evening
of
kenneth
visit
passed
uneventfully
his
bedroom
window
looked
over
the
moat
and
early
next
morning
he
tried
to
catch
fish
with
several
pieces
of
string
knotted
together
and
a
hairpin
kindly
lent
to
him
by
the
parlourmaid
he
did
not
catch
any
fish
partly
because
he
baited
the
hairpin
with
brown
windsor
soap
and
it
washed
off
fish
hate
soap
conrad
told
him
that
hook
of
yours
would
do
for
a
whale
perhaps
only
we
do
stock
our
moat
with
whales
but
i
ask
father
to
lend
you
his
rod
it
a
spiffing
one
much
jollier
than
ours
and
i
wo
tell
the
kids
because
they
never
let
it
down
on
you
fishing
with
a
hairpin
you
very
much
said
kenneth
feeling
that
his
cousin
was
a
man
and
a
brother
the
kids
were
only
two
or
three
years
younger
than
he
was
but
that
is
a
great
deal
when
you
are
the
elder
and
besides
one
of
the
kids
was
a
girl
a
bit
of
a
sneak
conrad
used
to
say
when
anger
overcome
politeness
and
brotherly
feeling
afterwards
when
the
anger
was
gone
and
the
other
things
left
he
would
say
see
she
went
to
a
beastly
school
for
a
bit
at
brighton
for
her
health
and
father
says
they
must
have
bullied
her
all
girls
are
not
like
it
i
believe
but
her
sneakish
qualities
if
they
really
existed
were
generally
hidden
and
she
was
very
clever
at
thinking
of
new
games
and
very
kind
if
you
got
into
a
row
over
anything
george
was
eight
and
stout
he
was
not
a
sneak
but
concealment
was
foreign
to
his
nature
so
he
never
could
keep
a
secret
unless
he
forgot
it
which
fortunately
happened
quite
often
the
uncle
very
amiably
lent
kenneth
his
and
provided
real
bait
in
the
most
thoughtful
and
generous
manner
and
the
four
children
fished
all
the
morning
and
all
the
afternoon
conrad
caught
two
roach
and
an
eel
george
caught
nothing
and
nothing
was
what
the
other
two
caught
but
it
was
glorious
sport
and
the
next
day
there
was
to
be
a
picnic
life
to
kenneth
seemed
full
of
new
and
delicious
excitement
in
the
evening
the
aunt
and
the
uncle
went
out
to
dinner
and
ethel
in
her
way
went
with
them
very
grand
in
a
blue
silk
dress
and
turquoises
so
the
children
were
left
to
themselves
you
know
the
empty
hush
which
settles
down
on
a
house
when
the
have
gone
out
to
dinner
and
you
have
the
whole
evening
to
do
what
you
like
in
the
children
stood
in
the
hall
a
moment
after
the
carriage
wheels
had
died
away
with
the
scrunching
swish
that
the
carriage
wheels
always
made
as
they
turned
the
corner
by
the
lodge
where
the
gravel
was
extra
thick
and
soft
owing
to
the
droppings
from
the
trees
from
the
kitchen
came
the
voices
of
the
servants
laughing
and
talking
two
hours
at
least
to
bedtime
said
alison
shall
we
do
alison
always
began
by
saying
shall
we
do
and
always
ended
by
deciding
what
should
be
done
all
say
what
you
think
she
went
on
then
we
vote
about
it
you
first
ken
because
you
the
visitor
said
kenneth
because
it
was
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
toffee
said
conrad
a
great
big
house
with
all
the
bricks
said
george
ca
make
toffee
alison
explained
gently
but
firmly
you
know
what
the
pan
was
like
last
time
and
cook
said
never
again
not
much
and
it
no
good
building
houses
georgie
when
you
could
be
out
of
doors
and
fishing
simply
rotten
when
we
been
at
it
all
day
i
thought
of
something
so
of
course
all
the
others
said
have
a
pageant
a
river
pageant
on
the
moat
we
all
dress
up
and
hang
chinese
lanterns
in
the
trees
i
be
the
sunflower
lady
that
the
troubadour
came
all
across
the
sea
because
he
loved
her
so
for
and
one
of
you
can
be
the
troubadour
and
the
others
can
be
sailors
or
anything
you
like
shall
be
the
troubadour
said
conrad
with
decision
think
you
ought
to
let
kenneth
because
he
the
visitor
said
george
who
would
have
liked
to
be
it
immensely
himself
or
anyhow
did
not
see
why
conrad
should
be
a
troubadour
if
could
conrad
said
what
manners
required
which
was
all
right
i
do
care
about
being
the
beastly
troubadour
might
be
the
princess
brother
alison
suggested
me
said
conrad
scornfully
be
the
captain
of
the
ship
a
turban
the
brother
would
be
with
the
benares
cloak
and
the
persian
dagger
out
of
the
cabinet
in
the
alison
went
on
unmoved
be
that
said
george
you
wo
i
shall
so
there
said
conrad
can
be
the
captain
of
the
ship
but
in
the
end
both
boys
were
captains
because
that
meant
being
on
the
boat
whereas
being
the
princess
brother
however
turbanned
only
meant
standing
on
the
bank
and
there
is
no
rule
to
prevent
captains
wearing
turbans
and
persian
daggers
except
in
the
navy
where
of
course
it
is
not
done
so
then
they
all
tore
up
to
the
attic
where
the
trunk
was
and
pulled
out
all
the
things
on
to
the
floor
and
all
the
time
they
were
dressing
alison
was
telling
the
others
what
they
were
to
say
and
do
the
princess
wore
a
white
satin
skirt
and
a
red
flannel
blouse
and
a
veil
formed
of
several
motor
scarves
of
various
colours
also
a
wreath
of
pink
roses
off
one
of
ethel
old
hats
and
a
pair
of
pink
satin
slippers
with
sparkly
buckles
kenneth
wore
a
blue
silk
and
a
yellow
sash
a
lace
collar
and
a
towel
turban
and
the
others
divided
between
them
an
eastern
once
the
property
of
their
grandfather
a
black
spangled
scarf
very
holey
a
pair
of
red
and
white
football
stockings
a
chinese
coat
and
two
old
muslin
curtains
which
rolled
up
made
turbans
of
enormous
size
and
fierceness
on
the
landing
outside
cousin
ethel
open
door
alison
paused
and
said
say
come
on
said
conrad
have
fixed
the
chinese
lanterns
yet
and
it
getting
dark
go
on
said
alison
just
thought
of
something
the
children
were
allowed
to
play
in
the
boat
so
long
as
they
loose
it
from
its
moorings
the
painter
was
extremely
long
and
quite
the
effect
of
coming
home
from
a
long
voyage
was
produced
when
the
three
boys
pushed
the
boat
out
as
far
as
it
would
go
among
the
boughs
of
the
which
overhung
the
water
and
then
reappeared
in
the
circle
of
red
and
yellow
light
thrown
by
the
chinese
lanterns
ho
ashore
there
shouted
the
captain
ho
said
a
voice
from
the
shore
which
alison
explained
was
disguised
be
three
poor
mariners
said
conrad
by
a
happy
effort
of
memory
newly
come
to
shore
we
seek
news
of
the
princess
of
tripoli
in
her
palace
said
the
disguised
voice
a
minute
and
i
tell
her
you
here
but
what
do
you
want
her
for
a
poor
minstrel
of
france
go
on
con
poor
minstrel
of
france
said
conrad
all
right
i
remember
who
has
heard
of
the
princess
beauty
has
come
to
lay
to
lay
heart
said
alison
illustration
a
radiant
vision

into
the
circle
of
light
right
i
know
his
heart
at
her
something
or
other
feet
feet
said
alison
go
to
tell
the
princess
next
moment
from
the
shadows
on
the
bank
a
radiant
vision
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
crying
rudel
is
it
indeed
thou
thou
art
come
at
last
o
welcome
to
the
arms
of
the
princess
do
i
do
now
whispered
rudel
who
was
kenneth
in
the
boat
and
at
the
same
moment
conrad
and
george
said
as
with
one
voice
hat
alison
wo
you
catch
it
for
at
the
end
of
the
princess
speech
she
had
thrown
back
her
veils
and
revealed
a
blaze
of
splendour
she
wore
several
necklaces
one
of
seed
pearls
one
of
topazes
and
one
of
australian
shells
besides
a
string
of
amber
and
one
of
coral
and
the
front
of
the
red
flannel
blouse
was
studded
with
brooches
in
one
at
least
of
which
diamonds
gleamed
each
arm
had
one
or
two
bracelets
and
on
her
clenched
hands
glittered
as
many
rings
as
any
princess
could
wish
to
wear
so
her
brothers
had
some
excuse
for
saying
catch
it
i
it
my
look
out
anyhow
do
shut
up
said
the
princess
stamping
her
foot
then
ken
go
ahead
ken
you
say
oh
lady
i
faint
with
rapture
faint
with
rapture
said
kenneth
stolidly
i
land
do
i
he
landed
and
stared
at
the
jewelled
hand
the
princess
held
out
last
at
last
she
said
you
ought
to
say
that
ken
i
say
i
think
i
better
be
an
eloping
princess
and
then
i
can
come
in
the
boat
rudel
dies
really
but
that
so
dull
lead
me
to
your
ship
oh
noble
stranger
for
you
have
won
the
princess
and
with
you
i
will
live
and
die
give
me
your
hand
ca
you
silly
and
do
mind
my
train
so
kenneth
led
her
to
the
boat
and
with
some
difficulty
for
the
satin
train
got
between
her
feet
she
managed
to
flounder
into
the
punt
you
stand
and
bow
she
said
rudel
with
this
ring
i
thee
wed
she
pressed
a
large
amethyst
ring
into
his
hand
that
the
princess
of
tripoli
is
yours
for
ever
now
let
sing
because
it
latin
so
they
sat
in
the
boat
and
sang
and
presently
the
servants
came
out
to
listen
and
admire
and
at
the
sound
of
the
servants
approach
the
princess
veiled
her
shining
splendour
prettier
than
wot
the
coventry
pageant
was
so
it
is
said
the
cook
it
long
past
your
bed
times
so
come
on
out
of
that
there
dangerous
boat
there
dears
so
then
the
children
went
to
bed
and
when
the
house
was
quiet
again
alison
slipped
down
and
put
back
ethel
jewelry
fitting
the
things
into
their
cases
and
boxes
as
correctly
as
she
could
notice
she
thought
but
of
course
ethel
did
so
that
next
day
each
child
was
asked
separately
by
ethel
mother
who
had
been
playing
with
ethel
jewelry
and
conrad
and
george
said
they
would
rather
not
say
this
was
a
form
they
always
used
in
that
family
when
that
sort
of
question
was
asked
and
it
meant
was
me
and
i
do
want
to
sneak
and
when
it
came
to
alison
turn
she
found
to
her
surprise
and
horror
that
instead
of
saying
played
with
them
she
had
said
would
rather
not
say
of
course
the
mother
thought
that
it
was
kenneth
who
had
had
the
jewels
to
play
with
so
when
it
came
to
his
turn
he
was
not
asked
the
same
question
as
the
others
but
his
aunt
said
you
are
a
very
naughty
little
boy
to
take
your
cousin
jewelry
to
play
with
did
said
kenneth
hush
said
the
aunt
not
make
your
fault
worse
by
untruthfulness
and
what
have
you
done
with
the
amethyst
ring
kenneth
was
just
going
to
say
that
he
had
given
it
back
to
alison
when
he
saw
that
this
would
be
sneakish
so
he
said
getting
hot
to
the
ears
do
suppose
i
stolen
your
beastly
ring
do
you
auntie
you
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
the
aunt
very
naturally
replied
kenneth
i
do
not
think
you
would
steal
but
the
ring
is
missing
and
it
must
be
found
kenneth
was
furious
and
frightened
he
stood
looking
down
and
kicking
the
leg
of
the
chair
had
better
look
for
it
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
because
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
go
to
the
picnic
with
the
others
the
mere
taking
of
the
jewelry
was
wrong
but
if
you
had
owned
your
fault
and
asked
ethel
pardon
i
should
have
overlooked
it
but
you
have
told
me
an
untruth
and
you
have
lost
the
ring
you
are
a
very
wicked
child
and
it
will
make
your
dear
mother
very
unhappy
when
she
hears
of
it
that
her
boy
should
be
a
liar
it
is
worse
than
being
a
thief
at
this
kenneth
fortitude
gave
way
and
he
lost
his
head
do
he
said
did
i
did
i
did
oh
do
tell
mother
i
a
thief
and
a
liar
oh
aunt
effie
please
do
and
with
that
he
began
to
cry
any
doubts
aunt
effie
might
have
had
were
settled
by
this
outbreak
it
was
now
quite
plain
to
her
that
kenneth
had
really
intended
to
keep
the
ring
will
remain
in
your
room
till
the
picnic
party
has
started
the
aunt
went
on
then
you
must
find
the
ring
remember
i
expect
it
to
be
found
when
i
return
and
i
hope
you
will
be
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
and
really
sorry
for
having
been
so
wicked
i
see
alison
was
all
he
found
to
say
and
the
answer
was
not
i
can
not
allow
you
to
associate
with
your
cousins
you
are
not
fit
to
be
with
honest
truthful
children
so
they
all
went
to
the
picnic
and
kenneth
was
left
alone
when
they
had
gone
he
crept
down
and
wandered
furtively
through
the
empty
rooms
ashamed
to
face
the
servants
and
feeling
almost
as
wicked
as
though
he
had
really
done
something
wrong
he
thought
about
it
all
over
and
over
again
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
certain
he
was
that
he
handed
back
the
ring
to
alison
last
night
when
the
voices
of
the
servants
were
first
heard
from
the
dark
lawn
but
what
was
the
use
of
saying
so
no
one
would
believe
him
and
it
would
be
sneaking
anyhow
besides
perhaps
he
handed
it
back
to
her
or
rather
perhaps
he
had
handed
it
and
she
had
taken
it
perhaps
it
had
slipped
into
the
boat
he
would
go
and
see
but
he
did
not
find
it
in
the
boat
though
he
turned
up
the
carpet
and
even
took
up
the
boards
to
look
and
then
an
extremely
miserable
little
boy
began
to
search
for
an
amethyst
ring
in
all
sorts
of
impossible
places
indoors
and
out
you
know
the
hopeless
way
in
which
you
look
for
things
that
you
know
perfectly
well
you
will
never
find
the
borrowed
penknife
that
you
dropped
in
the
woods
for
instance
or
the
which
slipped
through
that
hole
in
your
pocket
as
you
went
to
the
village
to
spend
it
the
servants
gave
him
his
meals
and
told
him
to
cheer
up
but
cheering
up
and
kenneth
were
for
the
time
strangers
people
in
books
never
can
eat
when
they
are
in
trouble
but
i
have
noticed
myself
that
if
the
trouble
has
gone
on
for
some
hours
eating
is
really
rather
a
comfort
you
do
enjoy
eating
so
much
as
usual
perhaps
but
at
any
rate
it
is
something
to
do
and
takes
the
edge
off
your
sorrow
for
a
short
time
and
cook
was
sorry
for
kenneth
and
sent
him
up
a
very
nice
dinner
and
a
very
nice
tea
roast
chicken
and
gooseberry
pie
the
dinner
was
and
for
tea
there
was
cake
with
almond
icing
on
it
the
sun
was
very
low
when
he
went
back
wearily
to
have
one
more
look
in
the
boat
for
that
detestable
amethyst
ring
of
course
it
was
not
there
and
the
picnic
party
would
be
home
soon
and
he
really
did
not
know
what
his
aunt
would
do
to
him
me
up
in
a
dark
cupboard
perhaps
he
thought
gloomily
put
me
to
bed
all
day
or
give
me
lines
to
write
out
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
the
boat
set
in
motion
by
his
stepping
into
it
swung
out
to
the
full
length
of
its
rope
the
sun
was
shining
almost
level
across
the
water
it
was
a
very
still
evening
and
the
reflections
of
the
trees
and
of
the
house
were
as
distinct
as
the
house
and
the
trees
themselves
and
the
water
was
unusually
clear
he
could
see
the
fish
swimming
about
and
the
sand
and
pebbles
at
the
bottom
of
the
moat
how
clear
and
quiet
it
looked
down
there
and
what
fun
the
fishes
seemed
to
be
having
wish
i
was
a
fish
said
kenneth
punishes
for
taking
rings
they
take
and
then
suddenly
he
saw
the
ring
itself
lying
calm
and
quiet
and
round
and
shining
on
the
smooth
sand
at
the
bottom
of
the
moat
he
reached
for
the
and
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
trying
to
get
up
the
ring
on
the
point
then
there
was
a
splash
gracious
i
wonder
what
that
is
said
cook
in
the
kitchen
and
dropped
the
saucepan
with
the
welsh
rabbit
in
it
which
she
had
just
made
for
kitchen
supper
kenneth
had
leaned
out
too
far
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
the
boat
had
suddenly
decided
to
go
the
other
way
and
kenneth
had
fallen
into
the
water
the
first
thing
he
felt
was
delicious
coolness
the
second
that
his
clothes
had
gone
and
the
next
thing
he
noticed
was
that
he
was
swimming
quite
easily
and
comfortably
under
water
and
that
he
had
no
trouble
with
his
breathing
such
as
people
who
tell
you
not
to
fall
into
water
seem
to
expect
you
to
have
also
he
could
see
quite
well
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
do
under
water
before
ca
think
he
said
to
himself
people
make
so
much
fuss
about
your
falling
into
the
water
i
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
swim
right
round
the
moat
while
i
about
it
illustration
there
was
a
splash
it
was
a
very
much
longer
swim
than
he
expected
and
as
he
swam
he
noticed
one
or
two
things
that
struck
him
as
rather
odd
one
was
that
he
could
see
his
hands
and
another
was
that
he
could
feel
his
feet
and
he
met
some
enormous
fishes
like
great
cod
or
halibut
they
seemed
he
had
had
no
idea
that
there
were
fish
of
that
size
they
towered
above
him
more
like
than
fish
and
he
was
rather
glad
to
get
past
them
there
were
numbers
of
smaller
fishes
some
about
his
own
size
he
thought
they
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
extremely
and
he
admired
the
clever
quickness
with
which
they
darted
out
of
the
way
of
the
great
hulking
fish
and
then
suddenly
he
ran
into
something
hard
and
very
solid
and
a
voice
above
him
said
crossly
then
who
are
you
of
ca
you
keep
your
eyes
open
and
keep
your
nose
out
of
gentlemen
shirt
fronts
beg
your
pardon
said
kenneth
trying
to
rub
his
nose
and
not
being
able
to
did
know
people
could
talk
under
water
he
added
very
much
astonished
to
find
that
talking
under
water
was
as
easy
to
him
as
swimming
there
can
talk
under
water
of
course
said
the
voice
they
did
they
never
talk
at
all
they
certainly
ca
talk
of
it
i
not
a
fish
said
kenneth
and
felt
himself
grin
at
the
absurd
idea
you
are
said
the
voice
course
you
a
fish
and
kenneth
with
a
shiver
of
certainty
felt
that
the
voice
spoke
the
truth
he
a
fish
he
must
have
become
a
fish
at
the
very
moment
when
he
fell
into
the
water
that
accounted
for
his
not
being
able
to
see
his
hands
or
feel
his
feet
because
of
course
his
hands
were
fins
and
his
feet
were
a
tail
are
you
he
asked
the
voice
and
his
own
voice
trembled
the
doyen
carp
said
the
voice
must
be
a
very
new
fish
indeed
or
you
know
that
come
up
and
let
have
a
look
at
you
kenneth
came
up
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
an
enormous
fish
who
had
round
staring
eyes
and
a
mouth
that
opened
and
shut
continually
it
opened
square
like
a
and
it
shut
with
an
extremely
sour
and
severe
expression
like
that
of
an
offended
rhinoceros
said
the
carp
a
new
fish
who
put
you
in
fell
in
said
kenneth
of
the
boat
but
i
not
a
fish
at
all
really
i
not
i
a
boy
but
i
do
suppose
you
believe
me
should
i
believe
you
asked
the
carp
wagging
a
slow
fin
tells
untruths
under
water
and
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
no
one
ever
does
me
your
true
story
said
the
carp
very
lazily
and
kenneth
told
it
these
humans
said
the
carp
when
he
had
done
in
such
a
hurry
to
think
the
worst
of
everybody
he
opened
his
mouth
squarely
and
shut
it
contemptuously
jolly
lucky
you
are
not
one
boy
in
a
million
turns
into
a
fish
let
me
tell
you
you
mean
that
i
got
to
being
a
fish
kenneth
asked
course
you
go
on
being
a
fish
as
long
as
you
stop
in
the
water
you
could
live
here
you
know
if
you
were
might
if
i
was
an
eel
said
kenneth
and
thought
himself
very
clever
an
eel
then
said
the
carp
and
swam
away
sneering
and
stately
kenneth
had
to
swim
his
hardest
to
catch
up
if
i
get
out
of
the
water
shall
i
be
a
boy
again
he
asked
panting
course
silly
said
the
carp
you
ca
get
out
ca
i
said
kenneth
the
fish
whisked
his
tail
and
swam
off
he
went
straight
back
to
the
amethyst
ring
picked
it
up
in
his
mouth
and
swam
into
the
shallows
at
the
edge
of
the
moat
then
he
tried
to
climb
up
the
slanting
mud
and
on
to
the
grassy
bank
but
the
grass
hurt
his
fins
horribly
and
when
he
put
his
nose
out
of
the
water
the
air
stifled
him
and
he
was
glad
to
slip
back
again
then
he
tried
to
jump
out
of
the
water
but
he
could
only
jump
straight
up
into
the
air
so
of
course
he
fell
straight
down
again
into
the
water
he
began
to
be
afraid
and
the
thought
that
perhaps
he
was
doomed
to
remain
for
ever
a
fish
was
indeed
a
terrible
one
he
wanted
to
cry
but
the
tears
would
not
come
out
of
his
eyes
perhaps
there
was
no
room
for
any
more
water
in
the
moat
the
smaller
fishes
called
to
him
in
a
friendly
jolly
way
to
come
and
play
with
them
they
were
having
a
quite
exciting
game
of
among
some
enormous
stalks
that
looked
like
trunks
of
great
trees
but
kenneth
had
no
heart
for
games
just
then
he
swam
miserably
round
the
moat
looking
for
the
old
carp
his
only
acquaintance
in
this
strange
wet
world
and
at
last
pushing
through
a
thick
tangle
of
water
weeds
he
found
the
great
fish
then
said
the
carp
testily
you
any
better
manners
than
to
come
tearing
a
gentleman
like
that
beg
your
pardon
said
kenneth
fish
i
know
how
clever
you
are
do
please
help
me
do
you
want
now
said
the
carp
and
spoke
a
little
less
crossly
want
to
get
out
i
want
to
go
and
be
a
boy
again
you
must
have
said
you
wanted
to
be
a
fish
did
mean
it
if
i
did
should
say
what
you
do
mean
try
not
to
again
said
kenneth
humbly
how
can
i
get
out
only
one
way
said
the
carp
rolling
his
vast
body
over
in
his
watery
bed
a
jolly
unpleasant
way
it
is
far
better
stay
here
and
be
a
good
little
fish
on
the
honour
of
a
gentleman
that
the
best
thing
you
can
do
want
to
get
out
said
kenneth
again
then
the
only
way
is
you
know
we
always
teach
the
young
fish
to
look
out
for
hooks
so
that
they
may
avoid
them
must
look
out
for
a
hook
and
let
them
catch
you
on
a
hook
the
carp
shuddered
and
went
on
solemnly
you
strength
have
you
patience
have
you
high
courage
and
determination
you
will
want
them
all
have
you
all
these
do
know
what
i
got
said
poor
kenneth
that
i
got
a
tail
and
fins
and
i
do
know
a
hook
when
i
see
it
wo
you
come
with
me
oh
dear
doyen
carp
come
and
show
me
a
hook
will
hurt
you
said
the
carp
much
indeed
you
take
a
gentleman
word
for
it
know
said
kenneth
need
rub
it
in
the
carp
rolled
heavily
out
of
his
bed
on
then
he
said
do
admire
your
taste
but
if
you
a
hook
well
the
gardener
boy
is
fishing
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
come
on
he
led
the
way
with
a
steady
stately
movement
want
to
take
the
ring
with
me
said
kenneth
i
ca
get
hold
of
it
do
you
think
you
could
put
it
on
my
fin
with
your
snout
what
shouted
the
old
carp
indignantly
and
stopped
dead
nose
i
meant
said
kenneth
please
do
be
angry
it
would
be
so
kind
of
you
if
you
would
shove
the
ring
on
i
mean
will
hurt
too
said
the
carp
and
kenneth
thought
he
seemed
not
altogether
sorry
that
it
should
it
did
hurt
very
much
indeed
the
ring
was
hard
and
heavy
and
somehow
kenneth
fin
would
not
fold
up
small
enough
for
the
ring
to
slip
over
it
and
the
carp
big
mouth
was
rather
clumsy
at
the
work
but
at
last
it
was
done
and
then
they
set
out
in
search
of
a
hook
for
kenneth
to
be
caught
with
wish
we
could
find
one
i
wish
we
could
kenneth
fish
kept
saying
just
looking
for
trouble
said
the
carp
here
you
are
above
them
in
the
clear
water
hung
a
worm
kenneth
boy
did
not
like
worms
any
better
than
you
do
but
to
kenneth
fish
that
worm
looked
most
tempting
and
delightful
wait
a
he
said
i
get
that
worm
little
silly
said
the
carp
the
take
it
a
said
kenneth
again
his
courage
was
beginning
to
ooze
out
of
his
fin
tips
and
a
shiver
ran
down
him
from
gills
to
tail
you
once
begin
to
think
about
a
hook
you
never
take
it
said
the
carp
said
kenneth
oh
he
cried
desperately
and
snapped
at
the
worm
a
sharp
pain
ran
through
his
head
and
he
felt
himself
drawn
up
into
the
air
that
stifling
choking
husky
thick
stuff
in
which
fish
can
not
breathe
and
as
he
swung
in
the
air
the
dreadful
thought
came
to
him
i
do
turn
into
a
boy
again
suppose
i
keep
being
a
fish
and
then
he
wished
he
had
but
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that
everything
grew
quite
dark
only
inside
his
head
there
seemed
to
be
a
light
there
was
a
wild
rushing
buzzing
noise
then
something
in
his
head
seemed
to
break
and
he
knew
no
more
when
presently
he
knew
things
again
he
was
lying
on
something
hard
was
he
kenneth
fish
lying
on
a
stone
at
the
bottom
of
the
moat
or
kenneth
boy
lying
somewhere
out
of
the
water
his
breathing
was
all
right
so
he
was
a
fish
out
of
water
or
a
boy
under
it
coming
to
said
a
voice
the
carp
he
thought
it
was
but
next
moment
he
knew
it
to
be
the
voice
of
his
aunt
and
he
moved
his
hand
and
felt
grass
in
it
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
above
him
the
soft
gray
of
the
evening
sky
with
a
star
or
two
the
ring
aunt
he
said
illustration
he
cried
desperately
and
snapped
at
the
worm
the
cook
had
heard
a
splash
and
had
run
out
just
as
the
picnic
party
arrived
at
the
front
door
they
had
all
rushed
to
the
moat
and
the
uncle
had
pulled
kenneth
out
with
the
he
had
not
been
in
the
water
more
than
three
minutes
they
said
but
kenneth
knew
better
they
carried
him
in
very
wet
he
was
and
laid
him
on
the
sofa
where
the
aunt
with
hurried
thoughtfulness
had
spread
out
the
uncle
mackintosh
some
rough
towels
jane
said
the
aunt
haste
do
got
the
ring
said
kenneth
mind
about
the
ring
dear
said
the
aunt
taking
his
boots
off
you
said
i
was
a
thief
and
a
liar
kenneth
said
feebly
it
was
in
the
moat
all
the
time
it
was
alison
who
shrieked
did
say
that
to
him
course
i
did
said
the
aunt
impatiently
she
thought
she
had
but
then
kenneth
thought
she
had
was
took
the
ring
said
alison
i
dropped
it
i
say
i
had
i
only
said
i
rather
not
say
oh
mother
poor
kenneth
the
aunt
without
a
word
carried
kenneth
up
to
the
and
turned
on
the
tap
the
uncle
and
ethel
followed
did
you
own
up
you
sneak
said
conrad
to
his
sister
with
withering
scorn
echoed
the
stout
george
meant
to
i
was
only
getting
steam
up
sobbed
alison
know
mother
only
told
us
she
was
pleased
with
ken
and
so
he
to
go
to
the
picnic
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
said
her
brothers
in
chorus
and
left
her
to
her
tears
of
shame
and
remorse
it
was
kenneth
who
next
day
begged
every
one
to
forgive
and
forget
and
as
it
was
day
rather
like
a
birthday
you
know
when
no
one
could
refuse
him
anything
all
agreed
that
the
whole
affair
should
be
buried
in
oblivion
every
one
was
tremendously
kind
the
aunt
more
so
than
any
one
but
alison
eyes
were
still
red
when
in
the
afternoon
they
all
went
fishing
once
more
and
before
kenneth
hook
had
been
two
minutes
in
the
water
there
was
a
bite
a
very
big
fish
the
uncle
had
to
be
called
from
his
study
to
land
it
a
magnificent
fellow
said
the
uncle
an
ounce
less
than
two
pounds
ken
i
have
it
stuffed
for
you
and
he
held
out
the
fish
and
kenneth
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
doyen
carp
there
was
no
mistaking
that
mouth
that
opened
like
a
and
shut
in
a
sneer
like
a
rhinoceros
its
eye
was
most
reproachful
no
cried
kenneth
helped
me
back
and
i
help
you
back
and
he
caught
the
carp
from
the
hands
of
the
uncle
and
flung
it
out
in
the
moat
head
not
quite
right
yet
my
boy
said
the
uncle
kindly
you
better
go
in
and
lie
down
a
bit
but
alison
understood
for
he
had
told
her
the
whole
story
he
had
told
her
that
morning
before
breakfast
while
she
was
still
in
deep
disgrace
to
cheer
her
up
he
said
and
most
disappointingly
it
made
her
cry
more
than
ever
poor
little
fins
she
had
said
having
your
feet
tied
up
in
your
tail
and
it
was
all
my
fault
liked
it
kenneth
had
said
with
earnest
politeness
was
a
most
awful
lark
and
he
quite
meant
what
he
said
xii
the
magician
heart
we
all
have
our
weaknesses
mine
is
mulberries
yours
perhaps
motor
cars
professor
taykin
was
christenings
royal
christenings
he
always
expected
to
be
asked
to
the
christening
parties
of
all
the
little
royal
babies
and
of
course
he
never
was
because
he
was
not
a
lord
or
a
duke
or
a
seller
of
bacon
and
tea
or
anything
really
but
merely
a
wicked
magician
who
by
economy
and
strict
attention
to
customers
had
worked
up
a
very
good
business
of
his
own
he
had
not
always
been
wicked
he
was
born
quite
good
i
believe
and
his
old
nurse
who
had
long
since
married
a
farmer
and
retired
into
the
calm
of
country
life
always
used
to
say
that
he
was
the
duckiest
little
boy
in
a
plaid
frock
with
the
dearest
little
fat
legs
but
he
had
changed
since
he
was
a
boy
as
a
good
many
other
people
do
perhaps
it
was
his
trade
i
dare
say
you
noticed
that
cobblers
are
usually
thin
and
brewers
are
generally
fat
and
magicians
are
almost
always
wicked
well
his
weakness
for
christenings
grew
stronger
and
stronger
because
it
was
never
indulged
and
at
last
he
the
bull
into
his
own
hands
as
the
irish
footman
at
the
palace
said
and
went
to
a
christening
without
being
asked
it
was
a
very
grand
party
given
by
the
king
of
the
fortunate
islands
and
the
little
prince
was
christened
fortunatus
no
one
took
any
notice
of
professor
taykin
they
were
too
polite
to
turn
him
out
but
they
made
him
wish
he
never
come
he
felt
quite
an
outsider
as
indeed
he
was
and
this
made
him
furious
so
that
when
all
the
bright
light
laughing
fairy
godmothers
were
crowding
round
the
blue
satin
cradle
and
giving
gifts
of
beauty
and
strength
and
goodness
to
the
baby
the
magician
suddenly
did
a
very
difficult
charm
in
his
head
like
you
do
mental
arithmetic
and
said
forty
may
be
all
that
but
say
he
shall
be
the
stupidest
prince
in
the
world
and
on
that
he
vanished
in
a
puff
of
red
smoke
with
a
smell
like
the
fifth
of
november
in
a
back
garden
on
streatham
hill
and
as
he
left
no
address
the
king
of
the
fortunate
islands
could
prosecute
him
for
high
treason
taykin
was
very
glad
to
think
that
he
had
made
such
a
lot
of
people
unhappy
the
whole
court
was
in
tears
when
he
left
including
the
baby
and
he
looked
in
the
papers
for
another
royal
christening
so
that
he
could
go
to
that
and
make
a
lot
more
people
miserable
and
there
was
one
fixed
for
the
very
next
wednesday
the
magician
went
to
that
too
disguised
as
a
wealthy
this
time
the
baby
was
a
girl
taykin
kept
close
to
the
pink
velvet
cradle
and
when
all
the
nice
qualities
in
the
world
had
been
given
to
the
princess
he
suddenly
said
aura
may
be
all
that
but
say
she
shall
be
the
ugliest
princess
in
all
the
world
and
instantly
she
was
it
was
terrible
and
she
had
been
such
a
beautiful
baby
too
every
one
had
been
saying
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
baby
they
had
ever
seen
this
sort
of
thing
is
often
said
at
christenings
having
uglified
the
unfortunate
little
princess
the
magician
did
the
spell
in
his
mind
just
as
you
do
your
spelling
to
make
himself
vanish
but
to
his
horror
there
was
no
red
smoke
and
no
smell
of
fireworks
and
there
he
was
still
where
he
now
very
much
wished
not
to
be
because
one
of
the
fairies
there
had
seen
just
one
second
too
late
to
save
the
princess
what
he
was
up
to
and
had
made
a
strong
little
charm
in
a
great
hurry
to
prevent
his
vanishing
this
fairy
was
a
white
witch
and
of
course
you
know
that
white
magic
is
much
stronger
than
black
magic
as
well
as
more
suited
for
performances
so
there
the
magician
stood
like
a
pig
as
some
one
unkindly
said
and
the
dear
white
witch
bent
down
and
kissed
the
baby
princess
she
said
can
keep
that
kiss
till
you
want
it
when
the
time
comes
you
know
what
to
do
with
it
the
magician
ca
vanish
sire
you
better
arrest
him
that
person
said
the
king
pointing
to
taykin
suppose
your
charms
are
of
a
permanent
nature
madam
said
the
fairy
least
they
never
go
till
there
no
longer
any
use
for
them
so
the
magician
was
shut
up
in
an
enormously
high
tower
and
allowed
to
play
with
magic
but
none
of
his
spells
could
act
outside
the
tower
so
he
was
never
able
to
pass
the
extra
double
guard
that
watched
outside
night
and
day
the
king
would
have
liked
to
have
the
magician
executed
but
the
white
witch
warned
him
that
this
would
never
do
you
see
she
said
the
only
person
who
can
make
the
princess
beautiful
again
and
he
do
it
some
day
but
do
you
go
him
to
do
it
he
never
do
anything
to
oblige
you
he
that
sort
of
man
so
the
years
rolled
on
the
magician
stayed
in
the
tower
and
did
magic
and
was
very
bored
for
it
is
dull
to
take
white
rabbits
out
of
your
hat
and
your
hat
out
of
nothing
when
there
no
one
to
see
you
prince
fortunatus
was
such
a
stupid
little
boy
that
he
got
lost
quite
early
in
the
story
and
went
about
the
country
saying
his
name
was
james
which
it
was
a
baker
wife
found
him
and
adopted
him
and
sold
the
diamond
buttons
of
his
little
overcoat
for
three
hundred
pounds
and
as
she
was
a
very
honest
woman
she
put
two
hundred
away
for
james
to
have
when
he
grew
up
the
years
rolled
on
aura
continued
to
be
hideous
and
she
was
very
unhappy
till
on
her
twentieth
birthday
her
married
cousin
belinda
came
to
see
her
now
belinda
had
been
made
ugly
in
her
cradle
too
so
she
could
sympathise
as
no
one
else
could
got
out
of
it
all
right
and
so
will
you
said
belinda
sure
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
a
magician
banished
them
all
twenty
years
ago
said
aura
behind
her
veil
but
the
one
who
uglified
me
i
should
go
to
said
beautiful
belinda
up
as
a
beggar
maid
and
give
him
fifty
pounds
to
do
it
not
more
or
he
may
suspect
that
you
not
a
beggar
maid
it
will
be
great
fun
i
go
with
you
only
i
promised
bellamant
faithfully
that
i
be
home
to
lunch
and
off
she
went
in
her
coach
leaving
aura
to
look
through
the
bound
volumes
of
perfect
in
the
palace
library
to
find
out
the
proper
costume
for
a
beggar
maid
now
that
very
morning
the
magician
old
nurse
had
packed
up
a
ham
and
some
eggs
and
some
honey
and
some
apples
and
a
sweet
bunch
of
flowers
and
borrowed
the
baker
boy
to
hold
the
horse
for
her
and
started
off
to
see
the
magician
it
was
forty
years
since
she
seen
him
but
she
loved
him
still
and
now
she
thought
she
could
do
him
a
good
turn
she
asked
in
the
town
for
his
address
and
learned
that
he
lived
in
the
black
tower
you
best
be
careful
the
townsfolk
said
a
spiteful
chap
you
said
the
old
nurse
wo
hurt
me
as
nursed
him
when
he
was
a
babe
in
a
plaid
frock
with
the
dearest
little
fat
legs
ever
you
see
so
she
got
to
the
tower
and
the
guards
let
her
through
taykin
was
almost
pleased
to
see
her
remember
he
had
had
no
visitors
for
twenty
years
and
he
was
quite
pleased
to
see
the
ham
and
the
honey
where
did
i
put
them
said
the
nurse
the
apples
i
must
have
left
them
at
home
after
all
she
had
but
the
magician
just
waved
his
hand
in
the
air
and
there
was
a
basket
of
apples
that
had
been
there
before
the
eggs
he
took
out
of
her
bonnet
the
folds
of
her
shawl
and
even
from
his
own
mouth
just
like
a
conjurer
does
only
of
course
he
was
a
real
magician
said
she
like
magic
magic
said
he
my
trade
it
quite
a
pleasure
to
have
an
audience
again
i
lived
here
alone
for
twenty
years
very
lonely
especially
of
an
evening
you
get
out
said
the
nurse
king
orders
must
be
respected
but
it
a
dog
life
he
sniffed
made
himself
a
magic
handkerchief
out
of
empty
air
and
wiped
his
eyes
an
apprentice
my
dear
said
the
nurse
teach
him
my
magic
not
me
you
got
one
so
stupid
he
learn
would
be
all
right
but
it
no
use
advertising
for
a
stupid
person
you
get
no
answers
need
advertise
said
the
nurse
and
she
went
out
and
brought
in
james
who
was
really
the
prince
of
the
fortunate
islands
and
also
the
baker
boy
she
had
brought
with
her
to
hold
the
horse
head
james
she
said
like
to
be
apprenticed
would
you
said
the
poor
stupid
boy
give
the
gentleman
your
money
james
james
did
last
doubts
vanish
said
the
magician
stupid
nurse
let
us
celebrate
the
occasion
with
a
little
drop
of
something
not
before
the
boy
because
of
setting
an
example
james
wash
up
not
here
silly
in
the
back
kitchen
so
james
washed
up
and
as
he
was
very
clumsy
he
happened
to
break
a
little
bottle
of
essence
of
dreams
that
was
on
the
shelf
and
instantly
there
floated
up
from
the
water
the
vision
of
a
princess
more
beautiful
than
the
day
so
beautiful
that
even
james
could
not
help
seeing
how
beautiful
she
was
and
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
as
she
came
floating
through
the
air
above
the
kitchen
sink
but
when
he
held
out
his
arms
she
vanished
he
sighed
and
washed
up
harder
than
ever
wish
i
was
so
stupid
he
said
and
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
james
wiped
his
hands
and
opened
some
one
stood
there
in
very
picturesque
rags
and
tatters
said
some
one
who
was
of
course
the
princess
professor
taykin
at
home
in
please
said
james
snakes
alive
said
taykin
a
day
we
having
three
visitors
in
one
morning
how
kind
of
you
to
call
wo
you

a
chair

said
the
veiled
princess

me
something
else

take
glass
of
wine

taykin

glass
of
wine

said
the
beggar
maid
who
was
the
princess

the
nurse
you

the
benefit
of

when

aura

be
safe

the
magician

she
abruptly
asked
little
said
he
ironically
said
she
like
this
i
so
ugly
no
one
can
bear
to
look
at
me
and
i
want
to
go
as
kitchenmaid
to
the
palace
they
want
a
cook
and
a
scullion
and
a
kitchenmaid
i
thought
perhaps
you
give
me
something
to
make
me
pretty
i
only
a
poor
beggar
maid
it
would
be
a
great
thing
to
me
if
along
with
you
said
taykin
very
cross
indeed
never
give
to
beggars
twopence
whispered
poor
james
pressing
it
into
her
hand
all
i
got
left
you
she
whispered
back
good
and
to
the
magician
she
said
happen
to
have
fifty
pounds
i
give
it
you
for
a
new
face
cried
taykin
another
stupid
one
he
grabbed
the
money
waved
his
wand
and
then
and
there
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
the
nurse
and
the
apprentice
the
ugly
beggar
maid
became
the
loveliest
princess
in
the
world
said
the
nurse
dream
cried
the
apprentice
said
the
princess
i
have
a
the
apprentice
ran
to
unhook
the
one
that
hung
over
the
kitchen
sink
and
handed
it
to
her
she
said
pretty
i
am
how
can
i
thank
you
easily
said
the
magician
maid
as
you
are
i
hereby
offer
you
my
hand
and
heart
he
put
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
and
pulled
out
his
heart
it
was
fat
and
pink
and
the
princess
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
you
very
much
said
she
i
rather
not
i
insist
said
taykin
really
your
offer
handsome
i
sure
said
the
nurse
affections
are
engaged
said
the
princess
looking
down
marry
you
i
to
take
this
as
a
refusal
asked
taykin
and
the
princess
said
she
feared
that
he
was
well
then
he
said
shall
see
you
home
and
ask
your
father
about
it
he
not
let
you
refuse
an
offer
like
this
nurse
come
and
tie
my
necktie
so
he
went
out
and
the
nurse
with
him
then
the
princess
told
the
apprentice
in
a
very
great
hurry
who
she
was
would
never
do
she
said
him
to
see
me
home
he
find
out
that
i
was
the
princess
and
he
uglify
me
again
in
no
time
see
you
home
said
james
may
be
stupid
but
i
strong
too
brave
you
are
said
aura
admiringly
i
rather
slip
away
quietly
without
any
fuss
ca
you
undo
the
patent
lock
of
that
door
the
apprentice
tried
but
he
was
too
stupid
and
the
princess
was
not
strong
enough
sorry
said
the
apprentice
who
was
a
prince
ca
undo
the
door
but
when
does
i
hold
him
and
you
can
get
away
i
dreamed
of
you
this
morning
he
added
dreamed
of
you
too
said
she
you
were
different
said
poor
james
sadly
person
you
dreamed
about
stupid
and
i
am
you
cried
the
princess
so
glad
rather
unkind
is
it
said
he
because
if
all
that
makes
you
different
from
the
man
i
dreamed
about
i
can
soon
make
all
right
and
with
that
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
and
at
her
kiss
his
stupidness
passed
away
like
a
cloud
and
he
became
as
clever
as
any
one
need
be
and
besides
knowing
all
the
ordinary
lessons
he
would
have
learned
if
he
had
stayed
at
home
in
his
palace
he
knew
who
he
was
and
where
he
was
and
why
and
he
knew
all
the
geography
of
his
father
kingdom
and
the
exports
and
imports
and
the
condition
of
politics
and
he
knew
also
that
the
princess
loved
him
so
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
they
were
very
happy
and
told
each
other
over
and
over
again
what
a
beautiful
world
it
was
and
how
wonderful
it
was
that
they
should
have
found
each
other
seeing
that
the
world
is
not
only
beautiful
but
rather
large
first
one
was
a
magic
kiss
you
know
said
she
fairy
godmother
gave
it
to
me
and
i
been
keeping
it
all
these
years
for
you
you
must
get
away
from
here
and
come
to
the
palace
oh
manage
it
you
clever
now
he
said
clever
now
i
can
undo
the
lock
for
you
go
my
dear
go
before
he
comes
back
so
the
princess
went
and
only
just
in
time
for
as
she
went
out
of
one
door
taykin
came
in
at
the
other
he
was
furious
to
find
her
gone
and
i
should
not
like
to
write
down
the
things
he
said
to
his
apprentice
when
he
found
that
james
had
been
so
stupid
as
to
open
the
door
for
her
they
were
not
polite
things
at
all
he
tried
to
follow
her
but
the
princess
had
warned
the
guards
and
he
could
not
get
out
he
cried
only
my
old
magic
would
work
outside
this
tower
soon
be
even
with
her
and
then
in
a
strange
confused
yet
quite
sure
way
he
felt
that
the
spell
that
held
him
the
white
witch
spell
was
dissolved
the
palace
he
cried
and
rushing
to
the
cauldron
that
hung
over
the
fire
he
leaped
into
it
leaped
out
in
the
form
of
a
red
lion
and
disappeared
without
a
moment
hesitation
the
prince
who
was
his
apprentice
followed
him
calling
out
the
same
words
and
leaping
into
the
same
cauldron
while
the
poor
nurse
screamed
and
wrung
her
hands
as
he
touched
the
liquor
in
the
cauldron
he
felt
that
he
was
not
quite
himself
he
was
in
fact
a
green
dragon
he
felt
himself
vanish
a
most
uncomfortable
sensation
and
reappeared
with
a
suddenness
that
took
his
breath
away
in
his
own
form
and
at
the
back
door
of
the
palace
the
time
had
been
short
but
already
the
magician
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
engagement
as
palace
cook
how
he
did
it
without
references
i
do
know
perhaps
he
made
the
references
by
magic
as
he
had
made
the
eggs
and
the
apples
and
the
handkerchief
taykin
astonishment
and
annoyance
at
being
followed
by
his
faithful
apprentice
were
soon
soothed
for
he
saw
that
a
stupid
scullion
would
be
of
great
use
of
course
he
had
no
idea
that
james
had
been
made
clever
by
a
kiss
how
are
you
going
to
cook
asked
the
apprentice
do
know
how
shall
cook
said
taykin
i
do
everything
else
by
magic
and
he
did
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
how
he
turned
out
a
hot
dinner
of
seventeen
courses
from
totally
empty
saucepans
how
james
looked
in
a
cupboard
for
spices
and
found
it
empty
and
how
next
moment
the
nurse
walked
out
of
it
the
magician
had
been
so
long
alone
that
he
seemed
to
revel
in
the
luxury
of
showing
off
to
some
one
and
he
leaped
about
from
one
cupboard
to
another
produced
cats
and
cockatoos
out
of
empty
jars
and
made
mice
and
rabbits
disappear
and
reappear
till
james
head
was
in
a
whirl
for
all
his
cleverness
and
the
nurse
as
she
washed
up
wept
tears
of
pure
joy
at
her
boy
wonderful
skill
this
excitement
bad
for
my
heart
though
taykin
said
at
last
and
pulling
his
heart
out
of
his
chest
he
put
it
on
a
shelf
and
as
he
did
so
his
magic
fell
from
his
breast
and
the
apprentice
picked
it
up
taykin
did
not
see
him
do
it
he
was
busy
making
the
kitchen
lamp
fly
about
the
room
like
a
pigeon
it
was
just
then
that
the
princess
came
in
looking
more
lovely
than
ever
in
a
simple
little
morning
frock
of
white
chiffon
and
diamonds
beggar
maid
said
taykin
like
a
princess
i
marry
her
just
the
same
come
to
give
the
orders
for
dinner
she
said
and
then
she
saw
who
it
was
and
gave
one
little
cry
and
stood
still
trembling
order
the
dinner
said
the
nurse
you
said
aura
the
princess
the
princess
said
the
magician
i
marry
you
all
the
more
and
if
you
say
no
i
uglify
you
as
the
word
leaves
your
lips
oh
yes
you
think
i
just
been
amusing
myself
over
my
cooking
but
i
really
been
brewing
the
strongest
spell
in
the
world
marry
me
or
drink
the
princess
shuddered
at
these
dreadful
words
or
marry
me
said
the
magician
you
marry
me
you
shall
be
beautiful
for
ever
said
the
nurse
a
match
even
for
a
princess
tell
papa
said
the
princess
sobbing
you
wo
said
taykin
father
will
never
know
if
you
marry
me
you
shall
drink
this
and
become
my
scullery
maid
my
hideous
scullery
maid
and
wash
up
for
ever
in
the
lonely
tower
he
caught
her
by
the
wrist
cried
the
apprentice
who
was
a
prince
nonsense
pooh
said
the
magician
i
say
said
james
who
was
fortunatus
got
your
heart
he
had
and
he
held
it
up
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
cooking
knife
step
nearer
that
lady
said
he
in
goes
the
knife
the
magician
positively
skipped
in
his
agony
and
terror
say
look
out
he
cried
careful
what
you
doing
accidents
happen
so
easily
suppose
your
foot
slipped
then
no
apologies
would
meet
the
case
that
my
heart
you
got
there
my
life
bound
up
in
it
know
that
often
the
case
with
people
hearts
said
fortunatus
got
you
my
dear
sir
on
toast
my
princess
might
i
trouble
you
to
call
the
guards
the
magician
did
not
dare
to
resist
so
the
guards
arrested
him
the
nurse
though
in
floods
of
tears
managed
to
serve
up
a
very
good
plain
dinner
and
after
dinner
the
magician
was
brought
before
the
king
now
the
king
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
that
his
daughter
had
been
made
so
beautiful
had
caused
a
large
number
of
princes
to
be
fetched
by
telephone
he
was
anxious
to
get
her
married
at
once
in
case
she
turned
ugly
again
so
before
he
could
do
justice
to
the
magician
he
had
to
settle
which
of
the
princes
was
to
marry
the
princess
he
had
chosen
the
prince
of
the
diamond
mountains
a
very
nice
steady
young
man
with
a
good
income
but
when
he
suggested
the
match
to
the
princess
she
declined
it
and
the
magician
who
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
steps
loaded
with
chains
clattered
forward
and
said
majesty
will
you
spare
my
life
if
i
tell
you
something
you
know
the
king
who
was
a
very
inquisitive
man
said
know
said
taykin
the
princess
wo
marry
choice
because
she
made
one
of
her
own
my
apprentice
the
princess
meant
to
have
told
her
father
this
when
she
had
got
him
alone
and
in
a
good
temper
but
now
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
in
full
audience
the
apprentice
was
dragged
in
and
all
the
princess
agonized
pleadings
only
got
this
out
of
the
king
right
i
wo
hang
him
he
shall
be
best
man
at
your
wedding
then
the
king
took
his
daughter
hand
and
set
her
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
set
the
prince
of
the
diamond
mountains
on
her
right
and
the
apprentice
on
her
left
then
he
said
will
spare
the
life
of
this
aspiring
youth
on
your
left
if
promise
never
to
speak
to
him
again
and
if
you
promise
to
marry
the
gentleman
on
your
right
before
tea
this
afternoon
the
wretched
princess
looked
at
her
lover
and
his
lips
formed
the
word
so
she
said
promise
never
to
speak
to
the
gentleman
on
my
left
and
to
marry
the
gentleman
on
my
right
before
tea
and
held
out
her
hand
to
the
prince
of
the
diamond
mountains
then
suddenly
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
prince
of
the
diamond
mountains
was
on
her
left
and
her
hand
was
held
by
her
own
prince
who
stood
at
her
right
hand
and
yet
nobody
seemed
to
have
moved
it
was
the
purest
and
most
magic
cried
the
king
dished
mere
trifle
said
the
apprentice
modestly
got
taykin
magic
recipe
book
as
well
as
his
heart
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
suppose
said
the
king
crossly
you
my
children
he
was
less
cross
when
it
was
explained
to
him
that
the
apprentice
was
really
the
prince
of
the
fortunate
islands
and
a
much
better
match
than
the
prince
of
the
diamond
mountains
and
he
was
quite
in
a
good
temper
by
the
time
the
nurse
threw
herself
in
front
of
the
throne
and
begged
the
king
to
let
the
magician
off
altogether
chiefly
on
the
ground
that
when
he
was
a
baby
he
was
the
dearest
little
duck
that
ever
was
in
the
prettiest
plaid
frock
with
the
loveliest
fat
legs
the
king
moved
by
these
arguments
said
spare
him
if
he
promise
to
be
good
will
ducky
wo
you
said
the
nurse
crying
said
the
magician
wo
and
what
more
i
ca
the
princess
who
was
now
so
happy
that
she
wanted
every
one
else
to
be
happy
too
begged
her
lover
to
make
taykin
good
magic
my
dearest
lady
said
the
prince
one
can
be
made
good
by
magic
i
could
take
the
badness
out
of
him
there
an
excellent
recipe
in
this
but
if
i
did
that
there
be
so
very
little
left
little
helps
said
the
nurse
wildly
prince
fortunatus
who
was
james
who
was
the
apprentice
studied
the
book
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
a
few
words
in
a
language
no
one
present
had
ever
heard
before
and
as
he
spoke
the
wicked
magician
began
to
tremble
and
shrink
my
boy
be
good
promise
you
be
good
cried
the
nurse
still
in
tears
the
magician
seemed
to
be
shrinking
inside
his
clothes
he
grew
smaller
and
smaller
the
nurse
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
still
he
grew
less
and
less
till
she
seemed
to
be
holding
nothing
but
a
bundle
of
clothes
then
with
a
cry
of
love
and
triumph
she
tore
the
magician
clothes
away
and
held
up
a
chubby
baby
boy
with
the
very
plaid
frock
and
fat
legs
she
had
so
often
and
so
lovingly
described
said
there
would
be
much
of
him
when
the
badness
was
out
said
the
prince
fortunatus
will
be
good
oh
i
will
said
the
baby
boy
that
had
been
the
magician
see
to
that
said
the
nurse
and
so
the
story
ends
with
love
and
a
wedding
and
showers
of
white
roses
