chapter
one
gissing
lived
alone
except
for
his
japanese
butler
in
a
little
house
in
the
country
in
that
woodland
suburb
region
called
the
canine
estates
he
lived
comfortably
and
thoughtfully
as
bachelors
often
do
he
came
of
a
respectable
family
who
had
always
conducted
themselves
calmly
and
without
too
much
argument
they
had
bequeathed
him
just
enough
income
to
live
on
cheerfully
without
display
but
without
having
to
do
addition
and
subtraction
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
then
tear
up
the
paper
lest
fuji
the
butler
should
see
it
it
was
strange
since
gissing
was
so
pleasantly
situated
in
life
that
he
got
into
these
curious
adventures
that
i
have
to
relate
i
do
not
attempt
to
explain
it
he
had
no
responsibilities
not
even
a
motor
car
for
his
tastes
were
surprisingly
simple
if
he
happened
to
be
spending
an
evening
at
the
country
club
and
a
rainstorm
came
down
he
did
not
worry
about
getting
home
he
would
sit
by
the
fire
and
chuckle
to
see
the
married
members
creep
away
one
by
one
he
would
get
out
his
pipe
and
sleep
that
night
at
the
club
after
telephoning
fuji
not
to
sit
up
for
him
when
he
felt
like
it
he
used
to
read
in
bed
and
even
smoke
in
bed
when
he
went
to
town
to
the
theatre
he
would
spend
the
night
at
a
hotel
to
avoid
the
fatigue
of
the
long
ride
on
the
train
he
chose
a
different
hotel
each
time
so
that
it
was
always
an
adventure
he
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
but
having
fun
is
not
quite
the
same
as
being
happy
even
an
income
of
bones
a
year
does
not
answer
all
questions
that
charming
little
house
among
the
groves
and
thickets
seemed
to
him
surrounded
by
strange
whispers
and
quiet
voices
he
was
uneasy
he
was
restless
and
did
not
know
why
it
was
his
theory
that
discipline
must
be
maintained
in
the
household
so
he
did
not
tell
fuji
his
feelings
even
when
he
was
alone
he
always
kept
up
a
certain
formality
in
the
domestic
routine
fuji
would
lay
out
his
dinner
jacket
on
the
bed
he
dressed
came
down
to
the
dining
room
with
quiet
dignity
and
the
evening
meal
was
served
by
as
long
as
fuji
was
at
work
gissing
sat
carefully
in
the
armchair
by
the
hearth
smoking
a
cigar
and
pretending
to
read
the
paper
but
as
soon
as
the
butler
had
gone
upstairs
gissing
always
kicked
off
his
dinner
suit
and
stiff
shirt
and
lay
down
on
the
but
he
did
not
sleep
he
would
watch
the
wings
of
flame
gilding
the
dark
throat
of
the
chimney
and
his
mind
seemed
drawn
upward
on
that
rush
of
light
up
into
the
pure
chill
air
where
the
moon
was
riding
among
sluggish
thick
floes
of
cloud
in
the
darkness
he
heard
chiming
voices
wheedling
and
tantalizing
one
night
he
was
walking
on
his
little
verandah
between
rafts
of
clouds
were
channels
of
sky
inconceivably
deep
and
transparent
the
air
was
serene
with
a
faint
acid
taste
suddenly
there
shrilled
a
soft
sweet
melancholy
whistle
earnestly
repeated
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
little
pond
in
the
copses
it
struck
him
strangely
it
might
be
anything
he
thought
he
ran
furiously
through
the
field
and
to
the
brim
of
the
pond
he
could
find
nothing
all
was
silent
then
the
whistlings
broke
out
again
all
round
him
maddeningly
this
kept
on
night
after
night
the
parson
whom
he
consulted
said
it
was
only
frogs
but
gissing
told
the
constable
he
thought
god
had
something
to
do
with
it
then
willow
trees
and
poplars
showed
a
pallid
bronze
sheen
forsythias
were
as
yellow
as
scrambled
eggs
maples
grew
knobby
with
red
buds
among
the
fresh
bright
grass
came
here
and
there
exhilarating
smells
of
last
year
buried
bones
the
little
upward
slit
at
the
back
of
gissing
nostrils
felt
prickly
he
thought
that
if
he
could
bury
it
deep
enough
in
cold
beef
broth
it
would
be
comforting
several
times
he
went
out
to
the
pantry
intending
to
try
the
experiment
but
every
time
fuji
happened
to
be
around
fuji
was
a
japanese
pug
and
rather
correct
so
gissing
was
ashamed
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
he
pretended
he
had
come
out
to
see
that
the
icebox
pan
had
been
emptied
properly
i
must
get
the
plumber
to
put
in
a
pukka
to
take
the
place
of
the
pan
gissing
said
to
fuji
but
he
knew
that
he
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
the
pan
was
his
private
test
of
a
good
servant
a
cook
who
forgot
to
empty
it
was
too
careless
he
thought
to
be
a
real
success
but
certainly
there
was
some
curious
elixir
in
the
air
he
went
for
walks
and
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
houses
he
threw
down
his
hat
and
stick
and
ran
wildly
with
great
exultation
over
the
hills
and
fields
i
really
ought
to
turn
all
this
energy
into
some
sort
of
constructive
work
he
said
to
himself
no
one
else
he
mused
seemed
to
enjoy
life
as
keenly
and
eagerly
as
he
did
he
wondered
too
about
the
other
sex
did
they
feel
these
violent
impulses
to
run
to
shout
to
leap
and
caper
in
the
sunlight
but
he
was
a
little
startled
on
one
of
his
expeditions
to
see
in
the
distance
the
curate
rushing
hotly
through
the
underbrush
his
clerical
vestments
dishevelled
his
tongue
hanging
out
with
excitement
i
must
go
to
church
more
often
said
gissing
in
the
golden
light
and
pringling
air
he
felt
excitable
and
his
tail
curled
upward
until
it
ached
finally
he
asked
mike
terrier
who
lived
next
door
what
was
wrong
it
spring
mike
said
oh
yes
of
course
jolly
old
spring
said
gissing
as
though
this
was
something
he
had
known
all
along
and
had
just
forgotten
for
the
moment
but
he
did
know
this
was
his
first
spring
for
he
was
only
ten
months
old
outwardly
he
was
the
brisk
genial
figure
that
the
suburb
knew
and
esteemed
he
was
something
of
a
mystery
among
his
neighbours
of
the
canine
estates
because
he
did
not
go
daily
to
business
in
the
city
as
most
of
them
did
nor
did
he
lead
a
life
of
brilliant
amusement
like
the
airedales
the
wealthy
people
whose
great
house
was
near
by
poodle
the
conscientious
curate
had
called
several
times
but
was
not
able
to
learn
anything
definite
there
was
a
little
of
parishioners
which
it
was
poodle
duty
to
fill
in
with
details
of
each
business
charitable
inclinations
and
what
he
could
do
to
amuse
a
church
sociable
the
card
allotted
to
gissing
was
marked
in
poodle
neat
script
friendly
but
vague
as
to
definite
participation
in
xian
activities
has
not
communicated
but
in
himself
gissing
was
increasingly
disturbed
even
his
seizures
of
joy
which
came
as
he
strolled
in
the
smooth
spring
air
and
sniffed
the
wild
vigorous
aroma
of
the
woodland
earth
were
troublesome
because
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
so
glad
every
morning
it
seemed
to
him
that
life
was
about
to
exhibit
some
delicious
crisis
in
which
the
meaning
and
excellence
of
all
things
would
plainly
appear
he
sang
in
the
bathtub
daily
it
became
more
difficult
to
maintain
that
decorum
which
fuji
expected
he
felt
that
his
life
was
being
wasted
he
wondered
what
ought
to
be
done
about
it
chapter
two
it
was
after
dinner
an
april
evening
and
gissing
slipped
away
from
the
house
for
a
stroll
he
was
afraid
to
stay
in
because
he
knew
that
if
he
did
fuji
would
ask
him
again
to
fix
the
dishcloth
rack
in
the
kitchen
fuji
was
very
short
in
stature
and
could
not
reach
up
to
the
place
where
the
rack
was
screwed
over
the
sink
like
all
people
whose
minds
are
very
active
gissing
hated
to
attend
to
little
details
like
this
it
was
a
weakness
in
his
character
fuji
had
asked
him
six
times
to
fix
the
rack
but
gissing
always
pretended
to
forget
about
it
to
appease
his
methodical
butler
he
had
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
fix
dishcloth
rack
and
pinned
it
on
his
pincushion
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
memorandum
he
went
out
into
a
green
april
dusk
down
by
the
pond
piped
those
repeated
treble
whistlings
they
still
distressed
him
with
a
mysterious
unriddled
summons
but
mike
terrier
had
told
him
that
the
secret
of
respectability
is
to
ignore
whatever
you
do
understand
careful
observation
of
this
maxim
had
somewhat
dulled
the
cry
of
that
shrill
queer
music
it
now
caused
only
a
faint
pain
in
his
mind
still
he
walked
that
way
because
the
little
meadow
by
the
pond
was
agreeably
soft
underfoot
also
when
he
walked
close
beside
the
water
the
voices
were
silent
that
is
worth
noting
he
said
to
himself
if
you
go
directly
at
the
heart
of
a
mystery
it
ceases
to
be
a
mystery
and
becomes
only
a
question
of
drainage
poodle
had
told
him
that
if
he
had
the
pond
and
swamp
drained
the
would
not
annoy
him
but
when
the
keen
chirruping
ceased
there
was
still
another
sound
that
did
not
cease
a
faint
appealing
cry
it
caused
a
prickling
on
his
shoulder
blades
it
made
him
both
angry
and
tender
he
pushed
through
the
bushes
in
a
little
hollow
were
three
small
puppies
whining
faintly
they
were
cold
and
draggled
with
mud
someone
had
left
them
there
evidently
to
perish
they
were
huddled
close
together
their
eyes
a
cloudy
unspeculative
blue
were
only
just
opened
this
is
gruesome
said
gissing
pretending
to
be
shocked
dear
me
innocent
pledges
of
sin
i
dare
say
well
there
is
only
one
thing
to
he
picked
them
up
carefully
and
carried
them
home
quick
fuji
he
said
warm
some
milk
some
of
the
grade
a
and
put
a
little
brandy
in
it
i
get
the
bed
he
rushed
upstairs
wrapped
the
puppies
in
a
blanket
and
turned
on
the
electric
heater
to
take
the
chill
from
the
the
little
pads
of
their
paws
were
and
he
filled
the
hot
water
bottle
and
held
it
carefully
to
their
twelve
feet
their
pink
stomachs
throbbed
and
at
first
he
feared
they
were
dying
they
must
not
die
he
said
fiercely
if
they
did
it
would
be
a
matter
for
the
police
and
no
end
of
fuji
came
up
with
the
milk
and
looked
very
grave
when
he
saw
the
muddy
footprints
on
the
clean
sheet
now
fuji
said
gissing
do
you
suppose
they
can
lap
or
will
we
have
to
pour
it
down
in
spite
of
his
superior
manner
fuji
was
a
good
fellow
in
an
emergency
it
was
he
who
suggested
the
filler
they
washed
the
ink
out
of
it
and
used
it
to
drip
the
hot
down
the
throats
their
noses
which
had
been
icy
suddenly
became
very
hot
and
dry
gissing
feared
a
fever
and
thought
their
temperatures
should
be
taken
the
only
thermometer
we
have
he
said
is
the
one
on
the
porch
with
the
mercury
split
in
two
i
do
suppose
that
would
do
have
you
a
clinical
thermometer
fuji
fuji
felt
that
his
employer
was
making
too
much
fuss
over
the
matter
no
sir
he
said
firmly
they
are
quite
all
right
a
good
sleep
will
revive
them
they
will
be
as
fit
as
possible
in
the
fuji
went
out
into
the
garden
to
brush
the
mud
from
his
neat
white
jacket
his
face
was
inscrutable
gissing
sat
by
the
bed
until
he
was
sure
the
puppies
were
sleeping
correctly
he
closed
the
door
so
that
fuji
would
not
hear
him
humming
a
lullaby
three
blind
mice
was
the
only
nursery
song
he
could
remember
and
he
sang
it
over
and
over
again
when
he
tiptoed
downstairs
fuji
had
gone
to
bed
gissing
went
into
his
study
lit
a
pipe
and
walked
up
and
down
thinking
by
and
bye
he
wrote
two
letters
one
was
to
a
bookseller
in
the
city
asking
him
to
send
at
once
one
copy
of
holt
book
on
the
care
and
feeding
of
children
and
a
edition
of
mother
goose
the
other
was
to
poodle
asking
him
to
fix
a
date
for
the
christening
of
three
small
nephews
who
had
come
to
live
with
him
it
is
lucky
they
are
all
boys
said
gissing
i
would
know
nothing
about
bringing
up
i
suppose
he
added
after
a
while
that
i
shall
have
to
raise
then
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
fixed
the
dishcloth
rack
before
going
to
bed
that
night
he
took
his
usual
walk
around
the
house
the
sky
was
freckled
with
stars
it
was
generally
his
habit
to
make
a
tour
of
his
property
toward
midnight
to
be
sure
everything
was
in
good
order
he
always
looked
into
the
and
admired
the
cleanliness
of
fuji
arrangements
the
milk
bottles
were
properly
capped
with
their
round
cardboard
tops
the
cheese
was
never
put
on
the
same
rack
with
the
butter
the
doors
of
the
were
carefully
latched
such
observations
and
the
slow
twinkle
of
the
fire
in
the
range
deep
down
under
the
curfew
layer
of
coals
pleased
him
in
the
cellar
he
peeped
into
the
garbage
can
for
it
was
always
a
satisfaction
to
assure
himself
that
fuji
did
not
waste
anything
that
could
be
used
one
of
the
laundry
tub
taps
was
dripping
with
a
soft
measured
tinkle
he
said
to
himself
that
he
really
must
have
it
attended
to
all
these
domestic
matters
seemed
more
significant
than
ever
when
he
thought
of
youthful
innocence
sleeping
upstairs
in
the
bed
his
had
been
a
selfish
life
hitherto
he
feared
these
puppies
were
just
what
he
needed
to
take
him
out
of
himself
busy
with
these
thoughts
he
did
not
notice
the
ironical
whistling
coming
from
the
pond
he
tasted
the
night
air
with
cheerful
satisfaction
at
any
rate
will
be
a
fine
day
he
said
the
next
day
it
rained
but
gissing
was
too
busy
to
think
about
the
weather
every
hour
or
so
during
the
night
he
had
gone
into
the
spare
room
to
listen
attentively
to
the
breathing
of
the
puppies
to
pull
the
blanket
over
them
and
feel
their
noses
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
perspiring
a
little
and
he
was
worried
lest
they
catch
cold
his
morning
sleep
it
had
always
been
his
comfortable
habit
to
lie
abed
a
trifle
late
was
interrupted
about
seven
by
a
lively
clamour
across
the
hall
the
puppies
were
awake
perfectly
restored
and
while
they
were
too
young
to
make
their
wants
intelligible
they
plainly
expected
some
attention
he
gave
them
a
pair
of
old
slippers
to
play
with
and
proceeded
to
his
own
toilet
as
he
was
bathing
them
after
breakfast
he
tried
to
enlist
enthusiasm
did
you
ever
see
such
fat
rascals
he
said
i
wonder
if
we
ought
to
trim
their
tails
how
pink
their
stomachs
are
and
how
pink
and
delightful
between
their
toes
you
hold
these
two
while
i
dry
the
other
no
not
that
way
hold
them
so
you
support
their
spines
a
puppy
back
is
very
delicate
you
ca
be
too
careful
we
have
to
do
things
in
a
way
until
holt
book
comes
after
that
we
can
be
fuji
did
not
seem
very
keen
presently
in
spite
of
the
rain
he
was
dispatched
to
the
village
department
store
to
choose
three
small
cribs
and
a
multitude
of
safety
pins
plenty
of
safety
pins
is
the
idea
said
gissing
with
enough
safety
pins
handy
children
are
easy
to
as
soon
as
the
puppies
were
bestowed
on
the
porch
in
the
sunshine
for
their
morning
nap
he
telephoned
to
the
local
paperhanger
i
want
you
he
said
to
come
up
as
soon
as
you
can
with
some
nice
samples
of
nursery
wallpaper
a
lively
mother
goose
pattern
would
do
very
he
had
already
decided
to
change
the
spare
room
into
a
nursery
he
telephoned
the
carpenter
to
make
a
gate
for
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
was
so
busy
that
he
did
not
even
have
time
to
think
of
his
pipe
or
the
morning
paper
at
last
just
before
lunch
he
found
a
breathing
space
he
sat
down
in
the
study
to
rest
his
legs
and
looked
for
the
times
it
was
not
in
its
usual
place
on
his
reading
table
at
that
moment
the
puppies
woke
up
and
he
ran
out
to
attend
them
he
would
have
been
distressed
if
he
had
known
that
fuji
had
the
paper
in
the
kitchen
and
was
studying
the
help
wanted
columns
a
great
deal
of
interest
was
aroused
in
the
neighbourhood
by
the
arrival
of
gissing
nephews
as
he
called
them
several
of
the
ladies
who
had
ignored
him
hitherto
called
in
his
absence
and
left
extra
cards
this
implied
he
supposed
though
he
was
not
closely
versed
in
such
niceties
of
society
that
there
was
a
gissing
and
he
was
annoyed
for
he
felt
certain
they
knew
he
was
a
bachelor
but
the
children
were
a
source
of
nothing
but
pride
to
him
they
grew
with
astounding
rapidity
ate
their
food
without
coaxing
rarely
cried
at
night
and
gave
him
much
amusement
by
their
naive
ways
he
was
too
occupied
to
be
troubled
with
introspection
indeed
his
home
was
very
different
from
before
the
trim
lawn
in
spite
of
his
zealous
efforts
was
constantly
littered
with
toys
in
sheer
mischief
the
youngsters
got
into
his
wardrobe
and
chewed
off
the
tails
of
his
evening
dress
coat
but
he
felt
a
satisfying
dignity
and
happiness
in
his
new
status
as
head
of
a
family
what
worried
him
most
was
the
fear
that
fuji
would
complain
of
this
sudden
addition
to
his
duties
the
butler
face
was
rather
an
enigma
particularly
at
meal
times
when
gissing
sat
at
the
dinner
table
surrounded
by
the
three
puppies
in
their
high
chairs
with
a
spindrift
of
milk
and
spattering
generously
as
the
youngsters
plied
their
spoons
fuji
had
arranged
a
series
of
scuppers
made
of
oilcloth
underneath
the
chairs
but
in
spite
of
this
the
rug
after
a
meal
looked
much
as
the
desert
place
must
have
after
the
feeding
of
the
multitude
fuji
who
was
pensive
recalled
the
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
that
produced
twelve
baskets
of
fragments
the
vacuum
cleaner
got
clogged
by
a
surfeit
of
crumbs
gissing
saw
that
it
would
be
a
race
between
heart
and
head
if
heart
should
become
entangled
that
is
if
the
innocent
charms
of
the
children
should
engage
his
affections
before
his
reason
convinced
him
that
the
situation
was
now
too
arduous
there
was
some
hope
he
tried
to
ease
the
problem
also
by
mental
suggestion
it
is
really
remarkable
he
said
to
fuji
that
children
should
give
one
so
little
as
he
made
this
remark
he
was
speeding
hotly
to
and
fro
between
the
bathroom
and
the
nursery
trying
to
get
one
tucked
in
bed
and
another
undressed
while
the
third
was
lashing
the
tub
into
soapy
foam
fuji
made
his
habitual
response
very
good
but
one
fears
that
he
detected
some
insincerity
for
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
he
gave
notice
this
generally
happens
on
a
sunday
because
the
papers
publish
more
help
wanted
advertisements
then
than
on
any
other
day
i
sorry
sir
he
said
but
when
i
took
this
place
there
was
nothing
said
about
three
this
was
unreasonable
of
fuji
it
is
very
rare
to
have
everything
explained
beforehand
when
adam
and
eve
were
put
into
the
garden
of
eden
there
was
nothing
said
about
the
serpent
however
gissing
did
not
believe
in
entreating
a
servant
to
stay
he
offered
to
give
fuji
a
raise
but
the
butler
was
still
determined
to
leave
my
senses
are
very
delicate
he
said
i
really
can
not
stand
the
well
the
aroma
exhaled
by
those
three
children
when
they
have
had
a
warm
what
nonsense
cried
gissing
the
smell
of
wet
healthy
puppies
nothing
is
more
agreeable
you
are
i
do
believe
you
are
fond
of
puppies
think
of
their
wobbly
black
noses
consider
how
pink
is
the
little
cleft
between
their
toes
and
the
main
cushion
of
their
feet
their
ears
are
like
silk
inside
their
upper
jaws
are
parallel
black
ridges
most
remarkable
i
never
realized
before
how
beautifully
and
carefully
we
are
made
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
be
so
indifferent
to
these
there
was
a
moisture
in
fuji
eyes
but
he
left
at
the
end
of
the
week
chapter
three
a
solitary
little
path
ran
across
the
fields
not
far
from
the
house
it
lay
deep
among
tall
grasses
and
the
withered
brittle
stalks
of
last
autumn
goldenrod
and
here
gissing
rambled
in
the
green
hush
of
twilight
after
the
puppies
were
in
bed
in
less
responsible
days
he
would
have
lain
down
on
his
back
with
all
four
legs
upward
and
cheerily
shrugged
and
rolled
to
and
fro
as
the
crisp
was
very
pleasing
to
the
spine
but
now
he
paced
soberly
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
eddying
just
above
the
top
of
the
grasses
he
had
much
to
meditate
the
dogwood
tree
by
the
house
was
now
in
flower
the
blossoms
with
their
four
curved
petals
seemed
to
spin
like
tiny
white
propellers
in
the
bright
air
when
he
saw
them
fluttering
gissing
had
a
happy
sensation
of
movement
the
business
of
those
tremulous
petals
seemed
to
be
thrusting
his
whole
world
forward
and
forward
through
the
viewless
ocean
of
space
he
felt
as
though
he
were
on
a
ship
as
indeed
we
are
he
had
never
been
down
to
the
open
sea
but
he
had
imagined
it
there
he
thought
there
must
be
the
satisfaction
of
a
real
horizon
horizons
had
been
a
great
disappointment
to
him
in
earlier
days
he
had
often
slipped
out
of
the
house
not
long
after
sunrise
and
had
marvelled
at
the
blue
that
lies
upon
the
skyline
here
about
him
were
the
clear
familiar
colours
of
the
world
he
knew
but
yonder
on
the
hills
were
trees
and
spaces
of
another
more
heavenly
tint
that
soft
blue
light
if
he
could
reach
it
must
be
the
beginning
of
what
his
mind
required
he
envied
poodle
whose
cottage
was
on
that
very
hillslope
that
rose
so
imperceptibly
into
sky
one
morning
he
ran
and
ran
in
the
lifting
day
but
always
the
blue
receded
hot
and
unbuttoned
he
came
by
the
curate
house
just
as
the
latter
emerged
to
pick
up
the
morning
paper
where
does
the
blue
begin
gissing
panted
trying
hard
to
keep
his
tongue
from
sliding
out
so
wetly
the
curate
looked
a
trifle
disturbed
he
feared
that
something
unpleasant
had
happened
and
that
his
assistance
might
be
required
before
breakfast
it
is
going
to
be
a
warm
day
he
said
politely
and
stooped
for
the
newspaper
as
a
delicate
hint
where
does
began
gissing
quivering
but
at
that
moment
looking
round
he
saw
that
it
had
hoaxed
him
again
far
away
on
his
own
hill
the
other
side
of
the
village
shone
the
evasive
colour
as
usual
he
had
been
too
impetuous
he
had
not
watched
it
while
he
ran
it
had
circled
round
behind
him
he
resolved
to
be
more
methodical
the
curate
gave
him
a
blank
to
fill
in
relative
to
baptizing
the
children
and
was
relieved
to
see
him
hasten
away
but
all
this
was
some
time
ago
as
he
walked
the
meadow
path
gissing
suddenly
realized
that
lately
he
had
had
little
opportunity
for
pursuing
blue
horizons
since
fuji
departure
every
moment
from
dawn
to
dusk
was
occupied
in
three
weeks
he
had
had
three
different
servants
but
none
of
them
would
stay
the
place
was
too
lonely
they
said
and
with
three
puppies
the
work
was
too
hard
the
washing
particularly
was
a
horrid
problem
inexperienced
as
a
parent
gissing
was
probably
too
proud
he
wanted
the
children
always
to
look
clean
and
soigne
the
last
cook
had
advertised
herself
as
a
general
houseworker
afraid
of
nothing
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
week
wash
in
the
hamper
including
grimy
rompers
she
telephoned
to
the
station
for
a
taxi
gissing
wondered
why
it
was
that
the
working
classes
were
not
willing
to
do
as
much
as
he
who
had
been
reared
to
indolent
ease
even
more
he
was
irritated
by
a
suspicion
of
the
driver
he
could
not
prove
it
but
he
had
an
idea
that
this
uncouth
fellow
obtained
a
commission
from
the
airedales
and
collies
who
had
large
mansions
in
the
neighbourhood
for
luring
maids
from
the
smaller
homes
of
course
airedale
and
collie
could
afford
to
pay
any
wages
at
all
so
now
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
have
spaniel
the
charwoman
come
up
from
the
village
to
do
the
washing
and
ironing
two
days
a
week
the
rest
of
the
work
he
undertook
himself
on
a
clear
afternoon
when
the
neighbours
were
not
looking
he
would
take
his
own
shirts
and
things
down
to
the
pond
putting
them
neatly
in
the
bottom
of
the
red
with
the
puppies
sitting
on
the
linen
so
no
one
would
see
while
the
puppies
played
about
and
hunted
for
tadpoles
he
would
wash
his
shirts
himself
his
legs
ached
as
he
took
his
evening
stroll
keeping
within
earshot
of
the
house
so
as
to
hear
any
possible
outcry
from
the
nursery
he
had
been
on
his
feet
all
day
but
he
reflected
that
there
was
a
real
satisfaction
in
his
family
tasks
however
gruelling
now
at
last
he
said
to
himself
i
am
really
a
citizen
not
a
mere
dilettante
of
course
it
is
arduous
no
one
who
is
not
a
parent
realizes
for
example
the
extraordinary
amount
of
buttoning
and
unbuttoning
necessary
in
rearing
children
i
calculate
that
buttonings
are
required
for
each
one
before
it
reaches
the
age
of
even
rudimentary
independence
with
the
energy
so
expended
one
might
write
a
great
novel
or
chisel
a
statue
never
mind
these
urchins
must
be
my
works
of
art
if
one
were
writing
a
novel
he
could
not
delegate
to
a
hired
servant
the
composition
of
laborious
chapters
so
he
took
his
responsibility
gravely
this
was
partly
due
to
the
christening
service
perhaps
which
had
gone
off
very
charmingly
it
had
not
been
without
its
embarrassments
none
of
the
neighbouring
ladies
would
stand
as
godmother
for
they
were
secretly
dubious
as
to
the
children
origin
so
he
had
asked
good
spaniel
to
act
in
that
capacity
she
a
simple
kindly
creature
was
much
flattered
though
certainly
she
can
have
understood
very
little
of
the
symbolical
rite
gissing
filling
out
the
form
that
poodle
had
given
him
had
put
down
the
names
of
an
entirely
imaginary
brother
and
of
his
deceased
whom
he
asserted
as
the
parents
he
had
been
so
busy
with
preparations
that
he
did
not
find
time
before
the
ceremony
to
study
the
text
of
the
service
and
when
he
and
spaniel
stood
beneath
the
font
with
an
armful
of
ribboned
infancy
he
was
frankly
startled
by
the
magnitude
of
the
promises
exacted
from
him
he
found
that
on
behalf
of
the
children
he
must
renounce
the
devil
and
all
his
work
the
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
the
world
that
he
must
pledge
himself
to
see
that
these
infants
would
crucify
the
old
man
and
utterly
abolish
the
whole
body
of
it
was
rather
doubtful
whether
they
would
do
so
he
reflected
as
he
felt
them
squirming
in
his
arms
while
spaniel
was
busy
trying
to
keep
their
socks
on
when
the
curate
exhorted
him
to
follow
the
innocency
of
these
little
ones
it
was
disconcerting
to
have
one
of
them
burst
into
a
piercing
yammer
and
wriggle
so
forcibly
that
it
slipped
quite
out
of
its
little
embroidered
shift
and
flannel
band
but
the
actual
access
to
the
holy
basin
was
more
seemly
perhaps
due
to
the
children
imagining
they
were
going
to
find
tadpoles
there
when
poodle
held
them
up
they
smiled
with
a
vague
almost
bashful
simplicity
and
spaniel
could
not
help
murmuring
the
darlings
the
curate
less
experienced
with
children
had
insisted
on
holding
all
three
at
once
and
gissing
feared
lest
one
of
them
might
swarm
over
the
surpliced
shoulder
and
fall
splash
into
the
font
but
though
they
panted
a
little
with
excitement
they
did
nothing
to
mar
the
solemn
instant
while
spaniel
was
picking
up
the
small
socks
with
which
the
floor
was
strewn
gissing
was
deeply
moved
by
the
poetry
of
the
ceremony
he
felt
that
something
had
really
been
accomplished
toward
burying
the
old
and
if
spaniel
ever
grew
disheartened
at
the
he
was
careful
to
remind
her
of
the
beautiful
phrase
about
the
mystical
washing
away
of
sin
they
had
been
christened
groups
bunks
and
yelpers
three
traditional
names
in
his
family
indeed
he
was
reflecting
as
he
walked
in
the
dusk
spaniel
was
now
his
sheet
anchor
fortunately
she
showed
signs
of
becoming
extraordinarily
attached
to
the
puppies
on
the
two
days
a
week
when
she
came
up
from
the
village
it
was
even
possible
for
him
to
get
a
little
relaxation
to
run
down
to
the
station
for
tobacco
or
to
lie
in
the
hammock
briefly
with
a
book
looking
off
from
his
airy
porch
he
could
see
the
same
blue
distances
that
had
always
tempted
him
but
he
felt
too
passive
to
wonder
about
them
he
had
given
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
get
any
other
servants
if
it
had
been
possible
he
would
have
engaged
spaniel
to
sleep
in
the
house
and
be
there
permanently
but
she
had
children
of
her
own
down
in
the
shantytown
quarter
of
the
village
and
had
to
go
back
to
them
at
night
but
certainly
he
made
every
effort
to
keep
her
contented
it
was
a
long
steep
climb
up
from
the
hollow
so
he
allowed
her
to
come
in
a
taxi
and
charge
it
to
his
account
then
on
condition
that
she
would
come
on
saturdays
also
to
help
him
clean
up
for
sunday
he
allowed
her
on
that
day
to
bring
her
own
children
too
and
all
the
puppies
played
riotously
together
around
the
place
but
this
he
presently
discontinued
for
the
clamour
became
so
deafening
that
the
neighbours
complained
besides
the
young
spaniels
who
were
a
little
older
got
groups
bunks
and
yelpers
into
noisy
and
careless
habits
of
speech
he
was
anxious
that
they
should
grow
up
refined
and
was
distressed
by
little
shaggy
spaniel
having
brought
up
the
comic
section
of
a
sunday
paper
with
childhood
instinctive
taste
for
primitive
effects
the
puppies
fell
in
love
with
the
coloured
cartoons
and
badgered
him
continually
for
funny
there
is
a
great
deal
more
to
think
about
in
raising
children
he
said
to
himself
than
is
intimated
in
holt
book
on
care
and
feeding
even
in
matters
that
he
had
always
taken
for
granted
such
as
fairy
tales
he
found
perplexity
after
supper
he
now
joined
the
children
in
their
evening
bread
and
milk
for
after
cooking
them
a
hearty
lunch
of
meat
and
gravy
and
potatoes
and
peas
and
the
endless
spinach
and
carrots
that
the
doctors
advise
to
say
nothing
of
the
prunes
he
had
no
energy
to
prepare
a
special
dinner
for
himself
after
supper
it
was
his
habit
to
read
to
them
hoping
to
give
their
imaginations
a
little
exercise
before
they
went
to
bed
he
was
startled
to
find
that
grimm
and
hans
andersen
which
he
had
considered
as
authentic
classics
for
childhood
were
full
of
very
strong
stuff
morbid
sentiment
bloodshed
horror
and
all
manner
of
painful
circumstance
reading
the
tales
aloud
he
edited
as
he
went
along
but
he
was
subject
to
that
curious
weakness
that
afflicts
some
people
reading
aloud
made
him
helplessly
sleepy
after
a
page
or
so
he
would
fall
into
a
doze
from
which
he
would
be
awakened
by
the
crash
of
a
lamp
or
some
other
furniture
the
children
seized
with
that
furious
hilarity
that
usually
begins
just
about
bedtime
would
race
madly
about
the
house
until
some
breakage
or
a
burst
of
tears
woke
him
from
his
trance
he
would
thrash
them
all
and
put
them
to
bed
howling
when
they
were
asleep
he
would
be
touched
with
tender
compassion
and
steal
in
to
tuck
them
up
admiring
the
innocence
of
each
unconscious
muzzle
on
its
pillow
sometimes
in
a
crisis
of
his
problems
he
thought
of
writing
to
holt
for
advice
but
the
was
lacking
it
is
really
astonishing
how
children
can
exhaust
one
he
used
to
think
sometimes
after
a
long
day
he
was
even
too
weary
to
correct
their
grammar
you
lay
down
groups
would
admonish
yelpers
who
was
capering
in
his
crib
while
bunks
was
being
lashed
in
with
the
largest
size
of
safety
pins
and
gissing
doggedly
passing
from
one
to
another
was
really
too
fatigued
to
reprove
the
verb
picked
up
from
spaniel
fairy
tales
proving
a
disappointment
he
had
great
hopes
of
encouraging
them
in
drawing
he
bought
innumerable
coloured
crayons
and
stacks
of
scribbling
paper
after
supper
they
would
all
sit
down
around
the
table
and
he
drew
pictures
for
them
tongues
depending
with
concentrated
excitement
the
children
would
try
to
copy
these
pictures
and
colour
them
in
spite
of
having
three
complete
sets
of
crayons
a
full
roster
of
colours
could
rarely
be
found
at
drawing
time
bunks
had
the
violet
when
groups
wanted
it
and
so
on
but
still
this
was
often
the
happiest
hour
of
the
day
gissing
drew
amazing
trains
elephants
ships
and
rainbows
with
the
spectrum
of
colours
correctly
arranged
and
blended
the
children
specially
loved
his
landscapes
which
were
opulently
tinted
and
magnificent
in
long
perspectives
he
found
himself
always
colouring
the
far
horizons
a
pale
and
haunting
blue
he
was
meditating
these
things
when
a
shrill
yammer
recalled
him
to
the
house
chapter
four
in
this
warm
summer
weather
gissing
slept
on
a
little
outdoor
balcony
that
opened
off
the
nursery
the
world
rolling
in
her
majestic
seaway
heeled
her
gunwale
slowly
into
the
trough
of
space
disked
upon
this
bulwark
the
sun
rose
and
promptly
gissing
woke
the
poplars
flittered
in
a
cool
stir
beyond
the
tadpole
pond
through
a
notch
in
the
landscape
he
could
see
the
far
darkness
of
the
hills
that
fringe
of
woods
was
a
railing
that
kept
the
sky
from
flooding
over
the
earth
the
level
sun
warily
peering
over
the
edge
like
a
cautious
marksman
fired
golden
volleys
unerringly
at
him
at
once
gissing
was
aware
and
watchful
brief
truce
was
over
the
hopeless
war
with
time
began
anew
this
was
his
placid
hour
light
so
early
lies
timidly
along
the
ground
it
steals
gently
from
ridge
to
ridge
it
is
soft
unsure
that
blue
dimness
receding
from
bole
to
bole
is
the
skirt
of
garment
trailing
off
toward
some
other
star
as
easily
as
it
slips
from
tree
to

it
glides
from
earth
to
orion
light
which
later
will
riot
and
revel
and
strike
pitilessly
down
still
is
tender
and
tentative
it
sweeps
in
rosy
parallel
to
earth
it
gilds
where
later
it
will
burn
gissing
lay
without
stirring
the
springs
of
the
old
couch
were
creaky
and
the
slightest
sound
might
arouse
the
children
within
now
until
they
woke
was
his
peace
purposely
he
had
had
the
sleeping
porch
built
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
house
making
the
sun
his
alarm
clock
he
prolonged
the
luxury
he
had
procured
the
darkest
and
most
opaque
of
all
shades
for
the
nursery
windows
to
cage
as
long
as
possible
in
that
room
night
the
silencer
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
song
of
the
mosquito
was
his
dreaded
nightingale
in
spite
of
screens
always
one
or
two
would
get
in
spaniel
he
feared
left
the
kitchen
door
ajar
during
the
day
and
these
borgias
of
the
insect
world
patiently
invasive
seized
their
chance
it
was
a
rare
night
when
a
sudden
scream
did
not
come
from
the
nursery
every
hour
or
so
daddy
a
keeto
a
keeto
was
the
anguish
from
one
of
the
trio
the
other
two
were
up
instantly
erect
and
yelping
in
their
cribs
small
black
paws
on
the
rail
pink
stomachs
candidly
exposed
to
the
winged
stilleto
lights
on
and
the
room
must
be
explored
for
the
lurking
foe
scratching
themselves
vigorously
the
fun
of
the
chase
assuaged
the
smart
of
those
red
welts
gissing
wise
by
now
knew
that
after
a
forager
the
mosquito
always
retires
to
the
ceiling
so
he
kept
a
stepladder
in
the
room
mounted
on
this
he
would
pursue
the
enemy
with
a
towel
while
the
children
screamed
with
merriment
then
stomachs
must
be
anointed
with
more
citronella
sheets
and
blankets
reassembled
and
quiet
gradually
restored
life
as
parents
know
can
be
supported
on
very
little
sleep
but
how
delicious
to
lie
there
in
the
morning
freshness
to
hear
the
earth
stir
with
reviving
gusto
the
merriment
of
birds
the
exuberant
clink
of
set
down
by
the
the
whole
complex
machinery
of
life
begin
anew
gissing
was
amazed
now
looking
back
upon
his
previous
existence
to
see
himself
so
busy
so
active
few
people
are
really
lazy
he
thought
what
we
call
laziness
is
merely
maladjustment
for
in
any
department
of
life
where
one
is
genuinely
interested
he
will
be
zealous
beyond
belief
certainly
he
had
not
dreamed
until
he
became
in
a
manner
of
speaking
a
parent
that
he
had
in
him
such
capacity
for
detail
this
business
of
raising
a
family
though
had
he
any
true
aptitude
for
it
or
was
he
forcing
himself
to
go
through
with
it
was
he
moreover
incurring
all
the
labours
of
parenthood
without
any
of
its
proper
dignity
and
social
esteem
chow
down
the
street
for
instance
why
did
she
look
so
sniffingly
upon
him
when
she
heard
the
children
in
the
harmless
uproar
of
their
play
cry
him
aloud
as
daddy
uncle
he
had
intended
they
should
call
him
but
that
is
for
beginning
speech
a
hard
saying
embracing
both
a
palatal
and
a
liquid
whereas
the
syllables
come
almost
unconsciously
to
the
infant
mouth
so
he
had
encouraged
it
and
even
felt
an
irrational
pride
in
the
honourable
but
unearned
title
a
little
word
daddy
but
one
of
the
most
potent
he
was
thinking
more
than
a
word
perhaps
a
great
social
engine
an
anchor
which
cast
carelessly
overboard
sinks
deep
and
fast
into
the
very
bottom
the
vessel
rides
on
her
hawser
and
where
are
your
blue
horizons
then
but
come
now
is
one
horizon
as
good
as
another
and
do
they
really
remain
blue
when
you
reach
them
unconsciously
he
stirred
stretching
his
legs
deeply
into
the
comfortable
nest
of
his
couch
the
springs
twanged
simultaneous
clamours
the
puppies
were
awake
they
yelled
to
be
let
out
from
the
cribs
this
was
the
time
of
the
morning
frolic
gissing
had
learned
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
deal
with
the
almost
inexhaustible
energy
of
childhood
that
is
not
to
attempt
to
check
it
but
to
encourage
and
draw
it
out
to
start
the
day
with
a
rush
stimulating
every
possible
outlet
of
zeal
meanwhile
taking
things
as
calmly
and
quietly
as
possible
himself
sitting
often
to
take
the
weight
off
his
legs
and
allowing
the
youngsters
to
wear
themselves
down
this
after
all
is
nature
own
way
with
man
it
is
the
wise
parent
tactic
with
children
thus
by
dusk
the
puppies
will
have
run
themselves
almost
into
a
stupor
and
you
if
you
have
shrewdly
husbanded
your
strength
may
have
still
a
little
power
in
reserve
for
reading
and
smoking
the
game
was
conducted
on
regular
routine
children
show
their
membership
in
the
species
by
their
love
of
strict
habit
gissing
let
them
yell
for
a
few
moments
as
long
as
he
thought
the
neighbours
would
endure
it
while
he
gradually
gathered
strength
and
resolution
shook
off
the
cowardice
of
bed
then
he
strode
into
the
nursery
as
soon
as
they
heard
him
raising
the
shades
there
was
complete
silence
they
hastened
to
pull
the
blankets
over
themselves
and
lay
tense
faces
on
paws
with
bright
expectant
upward
eyes
they
trembled
a
little
with
impatience
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
restrain
himself
from
patting
the
sleek
heads
which
always
seemed
to
shine
with
extra
polish
after
a
night
rolling
to
and
fro
on
the
flattened
pillows
but
sternness
was
a
part
of
the
game
at
this
moment
he
solemnly
unlatched
and
lowered
the
tall
sides
of
the
cribs
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
gesture
of
command
quiet
now
he
said
quiet
until
i
tell
you
yelpers
could
not
help
a
small
whine
of
intense
emotion
which
slipped
out
unintended
the
eyes
of
groups
and
bunks
swivelled
angrily
toward
their
unlucky
brother
it
was
his
failing
in
crises
he
always
emitted
haphazard
sounds
but
this
time
gissing
with
lenient
forgiveness
pretended
not
to
have
heard
he
returned
to
the
balcony
and
reentered
his
couch
where
he
lay
feigning
sleep
in
the
nursery
was
a
terrific
stillness
it
was
the
rule
of
the
game
that
they
should
lie
thus
in
absolute
quiet
until
he
uttered
a
huge
imitation
snore
once
after
a
particularly
exhausting
night
he
had
postponed
the
snore
too
long
he
fell
asleep
he
did
not
wake
for
an
hour
and
then
found
the
tragic
three
also
sprawled
in
amazing
slumber
but
their
pillows
were
wet
with
tears
he
never
succumbed
again
no
matter
how
deeply
tempted
he
snored
there
were
three
sprawling
thumps
a
rush
of
feet
and
a
tumbling
squeeze
through
the
screen
door
then
they
were
on
the
couch
and
upon
him
with
panting
yelps
of
glee
their
hot
tongues
rasped
busily
over
his
face
this
was
the
great
tickling
game
remembering
his
theory
of
conserving
energy
he
lay
passive
while
they
rollicked
and
scrambled
burrowing
in
the
bedclothes
quivering
imps
of
absurd
pleasure
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
give
an
occasional
squirm
to
tweak
their
ribs
now
and
then
so
that
they
believed
his
heart
was
in
the
sport
really
he
got
quite
a
little
rest
while
they
were
scuffling
no
one
knew
exactly
what
was
the
imagined
purpose
of
the
lark
whether
he
was
supposed
to
be
trying
to
escape
from
them
or
they
from
him
like
all
the
best
games
it
had
not
been
carefully
thought
out
now
children
said
gissing
presently
time
to
get
it
was
amazing
how
fast
they
were
growing
already
they
were
beginning
to
take
a
pride
in
trying
to
dress
themselves
while
gissing
was
in
the
bathroom
enjoying
his
cold
tub
and
under
the
stimulus
of
that
icy
sluice
forming
excellent
resolutions
for
the
day
the
children
were
sitting
on
the
nursery
floor
eagerly
studying
the
intricacies
of
their
gear
by
the
time
he
returned
they
would
have
half
their
garments
on
wrong
waist
and
trousers
front
side
to
rear
right
shoes
on
left
feet
buttons
hopelessly
mismated
to
buttonholes
shoelacings
oddly
zigzagged
it
was
far
more
trouble
to
permit
their
ambitious
bungling
which
must
be
undone
and
painstakingly
reassembled
than
to
have
clad
them
all
himself
swiftly
revolving
and
garmenting
them
like
dolls
but
in
these
early
hours
of
the
day
patience
still
is
robust
it
was
his
pedagogy
to
encourage
their
innocent
initiatives
so
long
as
endurance
might
permit
best
of
all
he
enjoyed
watching
them
clean
their
teeth
it
was
delicious
to
see
them
tiptoe
on
their
hind
legs
at
the
basin
to
which
their
noses
just
reached
mouths
gaping
wide
as
they
scrubbed
with
very
small
toothbrushes
they
were
so
elated
by
squeezing
out
the
toothpaste
from
the
tube
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
them
this
privilege
though
it
was
wasteful
for
they
always
squeezed
out
more
than
necessary
and
after
a
moment
brushing
their
mouths
became
choked
and
clotted
with
the
pungent
foam
much
of
this
they
swallowed
for
he
had
not
been
able
to
teach
them
to
rinse
and
gargle
their
only
idea
regarding
any
fluid
in
the
mouth
was
to
swallow
it
so
they
coughed
and
strangled
and
barked
gissing
had
a
theory
that
this
toothpaste
foam
most
be
an
appetizer
for
he
found
that
the
more
of
it
they
swallowed
the
better
they
ate
their
breakfast
after
breakfast
he
hurried
them
out
into
the
garden
before
the
day
became
too
hot
as
he
put
a
new
lot
of
prunes
to
soak
in
cold
water
he
could
not
help
reflecting
how
different
the
kitchen
and
pantry
looked
from
the
time
of
fuji
the
pan
seemed
to
be
continually
brimming
over
somehow
due
he
feared
to
a
laxity
on
spaniel
part
ants
had
got
in
he
was
always
finding
them
inside
the
and
wondered
where
they
came
from
he
was
amazed
to
find
how
negligent
he
was
growing
about
pots
and
pans
he
began
cooking
a
new
mess
of
oatmeal
in
the
double
boiler
without
bothering
to
scrape
out
the
too
adhesive
remnant
of
the
previous
porridge
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
children
are
tougher
and
more
enduring
than
holt
will
admit
and
that
a
little
carelessness
in
matters
of
hygiene
and
sterilization
does
not
necessarily
mean
instant
death
truly
his
once
dainty
menage
was
deteriorating
he
had
put
away
his
fine
china
put
away
the
linen
napery
and
laid
the
table
with
oil
cloth
he
had
even
improved
upon
fuji
invention
of
scuppers
by
a
little
trough
which
ran
all
round
the
rim
of
the
table
to
catch
any
possible
spillage
he
was
horrified
to
observe
how
inevitably
callers
came
at
the
worst
possible
moment
and
chow
for
instance
drew
up
one
afternoon
in
their
coupe
with
their
intolerably
spotless
only
child
sitting
beside
them
groups
bunks
and
yelpers
were
just
then
filling
the
garden
with
horrid
clamour
they
had
been
quarrelling
and
one
had
pushed
the
other
two
down
the
back
steps
gissing
who
had
attempted
to
find
a
quiet
moment
to
scald
the
ants
out
of
the
had
just
rushed
forth
and
boxed
them
all
as
he
stood
there
angry
and
waving
a
steaming
dishclout
two
chows
appeared
the
puppies
at
once
set
upon
little
sandy
chow
and
had
thoroughly
mauled
his
starched
sailor
suit
in
the
driveway
before
two
minutes
were
past
gissing
could
not
help
laughing
for
he
suspected
that
there
had
been
a
touch
of
malice
in
the
chows
coming
just
at
that
time
he
had
given
up
his
flower
garden
too
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
shove
the
around
in
the
dusk
after
the
puppies
were
in
bed
formerly
he
had
found
the
purr
of
the
twirling
blades
a
soothing
stimulus
to
thought
but
nowadays
he
could
not
even
think
consecutively
perhaps
he
thought
the
residence
of
the
mind
is
in
the
legs
not
in
the
head
for
when
your
legs
are
thoroughly
weary
you
ca
seem
to
think
so
he
had
decided
that
he
simply
must
have
more
help
in
the
cooking
and
housework
he
had
instructed
spaniel
to
send
the
washing
to
the
and
spend
her
three
days
in
the
kitchen
instead
a
huge
bundle
had
come
back
from
the
laundry
and
he
had
paid
the
driver
with
dismay
he
sorted
the
clean
neatly
folded
garments

contemplating
this
list
gissing
went
to
his
desk
and
began
to
study
his
accounts
a
resolve
was
forming
in
his
mind
chapter
five
the
summer
evenings
sounded
a
very
different
music
from
that
thin
wheedling
of
april
it
was
now
a
soft
steady
vibration
the
incessant
drone
and
throb
of
locust
and
cricket
and
sometimes
the
sudden
rasp
dry
and
hard
of
katydids
gissing
in
spite
of
his
weariness
was
all
fidgets
he
would
walk
round
and
round
the
house
in
the
dark
unable
to
settle
down
to
anything
tired
but
incapable
of
rest
what
is
this
uneasiness
in
the
mind
he
asked
himself
the
great
sonorous
drumming
of
the
summer
night
was
like
the
bruit
of
time
passing
steadily
by
even
in
the
soft
eddy
of
the
leaves
lifted
on
a
drowsy
creeping
air
was
a
sound
of
discontent
of
troublesome
questioning
through
the
trees
he
could
see
the
lighted
oblongs
of
neighbours
windows
or
hear
stridulent
jazz
records
why
were
all
others
so
cheerfully
absorbed
in
the
minutiae
of
their
lives
and
he
so
painfully
ill
at
ease
sometimes
under
the
warm
clear
darkness
the
noises
of
field
and
earth
swelled
to
a
kind
of
soft
thunder
his
quickened
ears
heard
a
thousand
small
outcries
contributing
to
the
awful
energy
of
the
world
faint
chimings
and
whistlings
in
the
grass
and
endless
flutter
rustle
and
whirr
his
own
body
on
which
hair
and
nails
grew
daily
like
vegetation
startled
and
appalled
him
consciousness
of
self
that
miserable
ecstasy
was
heavy
upon
him
he
envied
the
children
who
lay
upstairs
sprawled
under
their
mosquito
nettings
immersed
in
living
how
happily
unaware
of
being
alive
he
saw
with
tenderness
how
naively
they
looked
to
him
as
the
answer
and
solution
of
their
mimic
problems
but
where
could
he
find
someone
to
be
to
him
what
he
was
to
them
the
truth
apparently
was
that
in
his
inward
mind
he
was
desperately
lonely
reading
the
poets
by
fits
and
starts
he
suddenly
realized
that
in
their
divine
pages
moved
something
of
this
loneliness
this
exquisite
unhappiness
but
these
great
hearts
had
had
the
consolation
of
setting
down
their
moods
in
beautiful
words
words
that
lived
and
spoke
his
own
strange
fever
burned
inexpressibly
inside
him
was
he
the
only
one
who
felt
the
challenge
offered
by
the
maddening
fertility
and
foison
of
the
hot
earth
life
he
realized
was
too
amazing
to
be
frittered
out
in
this
aimless
sickness
of
heart
there
were
truths
and
wonders
to
be
grasped
if
he
could
only
throw
off
this
wistful
vague
desire
he
felt
like
a
clumsy
strummer
seated
at
a
dark
shining
grand
piano
which
he
knows
is
capable
of
every
glory
of
rolling
music
yet
he
can
only
elicit
a
few
haphazard
chords
he
had
his
moments
of
arrogance
too
ah
he
was
very
young
this
miracle
of
blue
unblemished
sky
that
had
baffled
all
others
since
life
began
he
he
would
unriddle
it
he
was
inclined
to
sneer
at
his
friends
who
took
these
things
for
granted
and
did
not
perceive
the
infamous
insolubility
of
the
whole
scheme
remembering
the
promises
made
at
the
christening
he
took
the
children
to
church
but
alas
carefully
analyzing
his
mind
he
admitted
that
his
attention
had
been
chiefly
occupied
with
keeping
them
orderly
and
he
had
gone
through
the
service
almost
automatically
only
in
singing
hymns
did
he
experience
a
tingle
of
exalted
feeling
but
poodle
was
proud
of
his
choir
and
gissing
had
a
feeling
that
the
congregation
was
not
supposed
to
do
more
than
murmur
the
verses
for
fear
of
spoiling
the
effect
in
his
favourite
hymns
he
had
a
tendency
to
forget
himself
and
let
go
his
vigorous
tenor
rang
lustily
then
he
realized
that
the
backs
of
heads
looked
surprised
the
children
could
not
be
kept
quiet
unless
they
stood
up
on
the
pews
poodle
preached
rather
a
long
sermon
and
yelpers
toward
remarked
in
a
clear
tone
of
interested
inquiry
what
time
does
god
have
dinner
gissing
had
a
painful
feeling
that
he
and
poodle
did
not
thoroughly
understand
each
other
the
curate
who
was
kindness
itself
called
one
evening
and
they
had
a
friendly
chat
gissing
was
pleased
to
find
that
poodle
enjoyed
a
cigar
and
after
some
hesitation
ventured
to
suggest
that
he
still
had
something
in
the
cellar
poodle
said
that
he
did
care
for
anything
but
his
host
could
not
help
hearing
the
curate
tail
quite
unconsciously
thumping
on
the
chair
cushions
so
he
excused
himself
and
brought
up
one
of
his
few
remaining
bottles
of
white
horse
poodle
crossed
his
legs
and
they
chatted
about
golf
politics
the
income
tax
and
some
of
the
recent
books
but
when
gissing
turned
the
talk
on
religion
poodle
became
gissing
warmed
and
cheered
by
the
vital
scotch
was
perhaps
too
direct
what
ought
i
to
do
to
the
old
man
he
said
poodle
was
rather
embarrassed
you
must
mortify
the
desires
of
the
flesh
he
replied
you
must
dig
up
the
old
bone
of
sin
that
is
buried
in
all
our
there
were
many
more
questions
gissing
wanted
to
ask
about
this
but
poodle
said
he
really
must
be
going
as
he
had
a
call
to
pay
on
and
chow
gissing
walked
down
the
path
with
him
and
the
curate
did
indeed
set
off
toward
the
chows
but
gissing
wondered
for
a
little
later
he
heard
a
cheerful
canticle
upraised
in
the
open
fields
he
himself
was
far
from
gay
he
longed
to
tear
out
this
malady
from
his
breast
poor
dreamer
he
did
not
know
that
to
do
so
is
to
tear
out
god
himself
mrs
spaniel
he
said
when
the
laundress
next
came
up
from
the
village
you
are
a
widow
are
you
yes
sir
she
said
poor
spaniel
was
killed
by
a
truck
two
years
ago
her
face
was
puzzled
but
beneath
her
apron
gissing
could
see
her
tail
wagging
do
misunderstand
me
he
said
quickly
i
got
to
go
away
on
business
i
want
you
to
bring
your
children
and
move
into
this
house
while
i
gone
i
make
arrangements
at
the
bank
about
paying
all
the
bills
you
can
give
up
your
outside
washing
and
devote
yourself
entirely
to
looking
after
this
spaniel
was
so
much
surprised
that
she
could
not
speak
in
her
amazement
a
bright
bubble
dripped
from
the
end
of
her
curly
tongue
hastily
she
caught
it
in
her
apron
and
apologized
how
long
will
you
be
away
sir
she
asked
i
do
know
it
may
be
quite
a
long
but
all
your
beautiful
things
furniture
and
everything
said
spaniel
i
afraid
my
children
are
a
bit
rough
they
not
used
to
living
in
a
house
like
this
well
said
gissing
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
there
are
some
things
more
important
than
furniture
it
will
be
good
for
your
children
to
get
accustomed
to
refined
surroundings
and
it
be
good
for
my
nephews
to
have
someone
to
play
with
besides
i
do
want
them
to
grow
up
spoiled
mollycoddles
i
think
i
been
fussing
over
them
too
much
if
they
have
good
stuff
in
them
a
little
roughening
wo
do
any
permanent
dear
me
cried
spaniel
what
will
the
neighbours
think
they
wo
said
gissing
i
do
doubt
they
talk
but
they
think
thinking
is
very
rare
i
got
to
do
some
myself
that
one
reason
why
i
going
you
know
spaniel
god
is
a
horizon
not
someone
sitting
on
a
spaniel
did
understand
this
in
fact
she
did
seem
to
hear
it
her
mind
was
full
of
the
idea
that
she
would
simply
have
to
have
a
new
dress
preferably
black
silk
for
sundays
gissing
very
sagacious
had
already
foreseen
this
point
let
not
have
any
argument
he
continued
i
have
planned
everything
here
is
some
money
for
immediate
needs
i
speak
to
them
at
the
bank
and
they
will
give
you
a
weekly
allowance
i
leave
you
here
as
caretaker
later
on
i
send
you
an
address
and
you
can
write
me
how
things
are
poor
spaniel
was
bewildered
she
came
of
very
decent
people
but
since
spaniel
took
to
drink
and
then
left
her
with
a
family
to
support
she
had
sunk
in
the
world
she
was
wondering
now
how
she
could
face
it
out
with
chow
and
and
the
other
neighbours
oh
dear
she
cried
i
do
know
what
to
say
sir
why
my
boys
are
so
they
have
even
a
collar
between
get
them
collars
and
anything
else
they
need
said
gissing
kindly
do
worry
spaniel
it
will
be
a
fine
thing
for
you
there
will
be
a
little
gossip
i
dare
say
but
we
have
to
chance
that
now
you
had
better
go
down
to
the
village
and
make
your
arrangements
leaving
late
that
evening
after
seeing
spaniel
and
her
brood
safely
installed
gissing
walked
to
the
station
with
his
suitcase
he
felt
a
pang
as
he
lifted
the
mosquito
nettings
and
kissed
the
cool
moist
noses
of
the
sleeping
trio
but
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
that
this
was
no
merely
vulgar
desertion
if
he
was
to
raise
the
family
he
must
earn
some
money
his
modest
income
would
not
suffice
for
this
sudden
increase
in
expenses
besides
he
had
never
known
what
freedom
meant
until
it
was
curtailed
for
the
past
three
months
he
had
lived
in
ceaseless
attendance
had
even
slept
with
one
ear
open
for
the
children
cries
now
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
make
one
great
strike
for
peace
wealth
he
could
see
was
the
answer
with
money
everything
was
attainable
books
leisure
for
study
travel
prestige
in
short
command
over
the
physical
details
of
life
he
would
go
in
for
big
business
already
he
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
power
and
prosperity
the
little
house
stood
silent
in
the
darkness
as
he
went
down
the
path
the
night
was
netted
with
the
weaving
sparkle
of
fireflies
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
suddenly
there
came
a
frightened
cry
from
the
nursery
daddy
a
keeto
a
keeto
he
nearly
turned
to
run
back
but
checked
himself
no
spaniel
was
now
in
charge
it
was
up
to
her
besides
he
had
only
just
enough
time
to
catch
the
last
train
to
the
city
but
he
sat
on
the
plush
of
the
smoker
in
a
mood
that
was
hardly
revelry
by
jove
he
said
to
himself
i
got
away
just
in
time
another
month
and
i
could
have
done
it
was
midnight
when
he
saw
the
lights
of
town
panelled
in
gold
against
a
peacock
sky
acres
and
acres
of
blue
darkness
lay
upon
the
gaudy
grids
of
light
here
one
might
really
look
at
this
great
miracle
of
shadow
and
see
its
texture
the
dulcet
air
drifted
lazily
in
deep
silent
crosstown
streets
ah
he
said
here
is
where
the
blue
chapter
six
for
students
of
the
troubled
heart
cities
are
perfect
works
of
there
is
a
city
so
tall
that
even
the
sky
above
her
seems
to
have
lifted
in
a
cautious
remove
inconceivably
far
there
is
a
city
so
proud
so
mad
so
beautiful
and
young
that
even
heaven
has
retreated
lest
her
placid
purity
be
too
nearly
tempted
by
that
brave
tragic
spell
in
the
city
which
is
maddest
of
all
gissing
had
come
to
search
for
sanity
in
the
city
so
strangely
beautiful
that
she
has
made
even
poets
silent
he
had
come
to
find
a
voice
in
the
city
of
glorious
ostent
and
vanity
he
had
come
to
look
for
humility
and
peace
all
cities
are
mad
but
the
madness
is
gallant
all
cities
are
beautiful
but
the
beauty
is
grim
who
shall
tell
me
the
truth
about
this
one
tragic
even
so
because
wherever
ambitions
vanities
and
follies
are
multiplied
by
millionfold
contact
calamity
is
there
noble
and
beautiful
aye
for
even
folly
may
have
the
majesty
of
magnitude
hasty
cruel
shallow
agreed
but
where
in
this
terrene
orb
will
you
find
it
otherwise
i
know
all
that
can
be
said
against
her
and
yet
in
her
great
library
of
streets
vast
and
various
as
shakespeare
is
beauty
enough
for
a
lifetime
o
poets
why
have
you
been
so
faint
because
she
seems
cynical
and
crass
she
cries
with
to
the
mind
of
the
dreamer
because
she
is
riant
and
mad
she
speaks
to
the
grave
sanity
of
the
poet
so
in
a
mood
perhaps
too
consciously
lofty
gissing
was
meditating
it
was
rather
impudent
of
him
to
accuse
the
city
of
being
mad
for
he
himself
in
his
glee
over
freedom
regained
was
not
conspicuously
sane
he
scoured
the
town
in
high
spirits
peering
into
riding
on
top
of
busses
going
to
the
zoo
taking
the
rickety
old
steamer
to
the
statue
of
liberty
drinking
afternoon
tea
at
the
ritz
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
the
first
three
nights
in
town
he
slept
in
one
of
the
little
that
perch
on
stilts
up
above
fifth
avenue
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
that
one
near
patrick
cathedral
he
had
ridden
up
the
avenue
in
a
taxi
intending
to
go
to
the
plaza
just
for
a
bit
of
splurge
after
his
domestic
confinement
as
the
cab
went
by
he
saw
the
dark
and
empty
and
thought
what
a
pleasant
place
to
sleep
so
he
asked
the
driver
to
let
him
out
at
the
cathedral
and
after
being
sure
that
he
was
not
observed
walked
back
to
the
little
turret
climbed
up
the
ladder
and
made
himself
at
home
he
liked
it
so
well
that
he
returned
there
the
two
following
nights
but
he
sleep
much
for
he
could
not
resist
the
fun
of
startling
taxis
by
suddenly
flashing
the
red
green
and
yellow
lights
at
them
and
seeing
them
stop
in
bewilderment
but
after
three
nights
he
thought
it
best
to
leave
it
would
have
been
awkward
if
the
police
had
discovered
him
it
was
time
to
settle
down
and
begin
work
he
had
an
uncle
who
was
head
of
an
important
business
far
but
gissing
with
the
quixotry
of
youth
was
determined
to
make
his
own
start
in
the
great
world
of
commerce
he
found
a
room
on
the
top
floor
of
a
quiet
brownstone
house
in
the
west
seventies
it
was
not
large
and
he
had
to
go
down
a
flight
for
his
bath
the
gas
burner
over
the
bed
whistled
the
dust
was
rather
startling
after
the
clean
country
but
it
was
cheap
and
his
sense
of
adventure
more
than
compensated
purp
the
landlady
pleased
him
greatly
she
was
very
maternal
and
urged
him
not
to
bolt
his
meals
in
armchair
lunches
she
put
an
ashtray
in
his
room
gissing
sent
spaniel
a
postcard
with
a
picture
of
the
pennsylvania
station
on
it
he
wrote
arrived
safely
hard
at
work
love
to
the
children
then
he
went
to
look
for
a
job
his
ideas
about
business
were
very
vague
all
he
knew
was
that
he
wished
to
be
very
wealthy
and
influential
as
soon
as
possible
he
could
have
had
much
sound
advice
from
his
uncle
who
was
a
member
of
the
union
kennel
and
quite
a
prominent
but
gissing
had
the
secretive
pride
of
inexperience
moreover
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
about
his
establishment
in
the
country
that
houseful
of
children
would
need
some
explaining
those
were
days
of
brilliant
heat
clear
golden
dry
the
society
columns
in
the
papers
assured
him
that
everyone
was
out
of
town
but
the
avenue
seemed
plentifully
crowded
with
beautiful
superb
creatures
far
down
the
gentle
slopes
of
that
glimmering
roadway
he
could
see
the
rolling
stream
of
limousines
dazzles
of
sunlight
caught
on
their
polished
flanks
a
faint
blue
haze
of
gasoline
fumes
hung
low
in
the
bright
warm
air
this
is
the
street
where
even
the
most
passive
are
pricked
by
the
strange
lure
of
carnal
dominion
nothing
less
than
a
job
on
the
avenue
itself
would
suit
his
mood
he
felt
fortune
and
audacity
united
as
they
always
do
to
concede
his
desire
he
was
in
the
beautiful
department
store
of
beagle
and
company
one
of
the
most
splendid
of
its
kind
looking
at
some
spats
in
an
aisle
near
by
he
heard
a
commotion
nothing
vulgar
but
still
an
evident
stir
with
repressed
yelps
and
a
genteel
horrified
bustle
he
hastened
to
the
spot
and
through
the
crowd
saw
someone
lying
on
the
floor
an
extremely
beautiful
charmingly
clad
in
black
crepe
de
chien
was
supporting
the
victim
head
vainly
fanning
him
wealthy
dowagers
were
whining
in
distress
then
an
ambulance
clanged
up
to
a
side
door
and
a
stretcher
was
brought
in
what
is
it
said
gissing
to
a
female
at
the
counter
one
of
the
floorwalkers
died
of
heat
prostration
she
said
looking
very
much
upset
poor
fellow
said
gissing
you
never
know
what
will
happen
next
do
you
he
walked
away
shaking
his
head
he
asked
the
elevator
attendant
to
direct
him
to
the
offices
of
the
firm
on
the
seventh
floor
down
a
quiet
corridor
behind
the
bedroom
suites
a
rosewood
fence
barred
his
way
a
secretary
faced
him
inquiringly
i
wish
to
see
mr
beagle
senior
or
beagle
junior
youth
cleaves
to
youth
said
gissing
to
himself
mr
beagle
junior
he
stated
firmly
have
you
an
appointment
yes
he
said
she
took
his
ward
disappeared
and
returned
this
way
please
she
said
beagle
senior
must
be
very
old
indeed
he
thought
for
junior
was
distinctly
grizzled
in
fact
so
rapidly
does
the
mind
run
beagle
senior
must
be
near
the
age
of
retirement
very
likely
he
said
to
himself
that
will
soon
occur
there
will
be
a
general
among
members
of
the
firm
and
that
will
be
my
chance
i
wonder
how
much
they
pay
a
junior
partner
he
almost
uttered
this
question
as
beagle
junior
looked
at
him
so
inquiringly
but
he
caught
himself
in
time
i
beg
your
pardon
for
intruding
said
gissing
but
i
am
the
new
you
are
very
kind
said
beagle
junior
but
we
do
not
need
a
new
i
beg
your
pardon
again
said
gissing
but
you
are
not
au
courant
with
the
affairs
of
the
store
one
has
just
died
right
by
the
counter
very
bad
for
at
this
moment
the
telephone
rang
and
beagle
seized
it
he
listened
sharply
examining
his
caller
meanwhile
you
are
right
he
said
as
he
put
down
the
receiver
well
sir
have
you
had
any
experience
not
exactly
of
that
sort
said
gissing
but
i
think
i
understand
the
requirements
the
tone
of
the
store
i
will
ask
you
to
be
here
at
this
afternoon
said
beagle
we
have
a
particular
routine
in
regard
to
candidates
for
that
position
you
will
readily
perceive
that
it
is
a
post
of
some
importance
the
floorwalker
is
our
point
of
social
contact
with
gissing
negligently
dusted
his
shoes
with
a
handkerchief
pray
do
not
apologize
he
said
kindly
i
am
willing
to
congratulate
with
you
on
your
good
fortune
it
was
mere
hazard
that
i
was
in
the
store
of
course
business
will
be
poor
but
i
think
you
will
find
at
said
beagle
a
little
puzzled
that
day
gissing
went
without
lunch
first
he
explored
the
whole
building
from
top
to
bottom
until
he
knew
the
location
of
every
department
and
had
the
store
directory
firmly
memorized
with
almost
proprietary
tenderness
he
studied
the
shining
goods
and
trinkets
noted
approvingly
the
clerks
who
seemed
to
him
specially
prompt
and
obliging
to
customers
scowled
a
little
at
any
sign
of
boredom
or
inattention
he
heard
the
soft
sigh
of
the
pneumatic
tubes
as
they
received
money
and
blew
it
to
some
distant
coffer
this
money
he
thought
was
already
partly
his
that
creature
whom
he
presently
discerned
following
him
was
undoubtedly
the
store
detective
he
smiled
to
think
what
a
pleasant
anecdote
this
would
be
when
he
was
admitted
to
junior
partnership
then
he
went
finally
to
the
special
masculine
shop
on
the
fifth
floor
where
he
bought
a
silk
hat
a
cutaway
coat
and
waistcoat
and
trousers
of
pearly
stripe
he
did
not
forget
patent
leather
shoes
nor
white
spats
he
refused
the
little
white
linen
margins
which
the
clerk
wished
to
affix
to
the
v
of
his
waistcoat
that
he
felt
was
the
ultra
touch
which
would
spoil
all
the
just
less
than
perfection
how
perfect
it
is
it
was
getting
late
he
hurried
to
penn
station
where
he
hired
one
of
those
little
dressing
booths
and
put
on
his
regalia
his
tweeds
in
a
neat
package
he
checked
at
the
parcel
counter
then
he
returned
to
the
store
for
the
important
interview
he
had
expected
a
formal
talk
with
the
two
beagle
perhaps
touching
on
such
matters
as
duties
hours
salary
and
so
on
to
his
surprise
he
was
ushered
by
the
secretary
into
a
charming
louis
xvi
salon
farther
down
the
private
corridor
there
were
several
ladies
one
was
pouring
tea
beagle
junior
came
forward
the
such
was
beagle
junior
rank
gissing
had
learned
by
the
sign
on
his
door
still
wore
his
business
garb
of
the
morning
gissing
immediately
felt
himself
to
have
the
advantage
but
what
a
pleasant
idea
he
thought
for
the
members
of
the
firm
to
have
tea
together
every
afternoon
he
handed
his
hat
gloves
and
stick
to
the
secretary
very
kind
of
you
to
come
said
beagle
let
me
present
you
to
my
beagle
at
the
received
him
graciously
cream
or
lemon
she
said
two
lumps
this
is
really
delightful
gissing
thought
only
on
fifth
avenue
could
this
kind
of
thing
happen
he
looked
down
the
hostess
from
his
superior
height
and
smiled
charmingly
do
you
permit
three
he
said
a
little
weakness
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
hated
tea
so
sweet
but
he
felt
it
was
strategic
to
fix
himself
in
beagle
mind
as
a
polished
eccentric
you
must
have
a
meringue
she
said
ah
pomeranian
has
them
pomeranian
let
me
present
pomeranian
small
and
plump
and
tightly
corseted
offered
the
meringues
while
beagle
pressed
upon
him
a
plate
with
a
small
doily
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
the
store
and
its
motto
je
maintiendrai
referring
no
doubt
to
its
prices
beagle
then
introduced
him
to
several
more
ladies
in
rapid
succession
gissing
passed
along
the
line
bowing
slightly
but
with
courteous
interest
to
each
to
each
one
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
permitted
himself
a
small
significant
smile
as
though
to
convey
that
this
was
a
moment
he
had
long
been
anticipating
how
different
he
thought
was
this
life
of
enigmatic
gaiety
from
the
suburban
drudgery
of
recent
months
if
only
spaniel
could
see
him
now
he
was
about
to
utilize
a
brief
pause
by
sipping
his
tea
when
a
patriarch
suddenly
appeared
beside
him
mr
gissing
said
the
this
is
my
father
beagle
gissing
by
quick
work
shuffled
the
teacup
into
his
left
paw
and
the
meringue
plate
into
the
crook
of
his
elbow
so
he
was
ready
for
the
old
gentleman
salutation
beagle
senior
was
indeed
very
old
his
white
hair
hung
over
his
eyes
he
spoke
with
growling
severity
manner
to
the
old
merchant
was
one
of
respectful
reassurance
he
attempted
to
make
an
impression
that
would
console
to
impart
of
course
without
saying
so
the
thought
that
though
the
head
of
the
firm
could
not
last
much
longer
yet
he
would
leave
his
great
traffic
in
capable
care
where
will
i
find
an
aluminum
cooking
pot
growled
the
elder
beagle
unexpectedly
in
the
bargain
basement
said
gissing
promptly
he
do
cried
the
president
to
his
surprise
on
looking
round
gissing
saw
that
all
the
ladies
had
vanished
beagle
junior
was
grinning
at
him
you
have
the
job
gissing
he
said
you
will
pardon
the
harmless
masquerade
we
always
try
out
a
floorwalker
in
that
way
my
father
thinks
that
if
he
can
handle
a
teacup
and
a
meringue
while
being
introduced
to
ladies
he
can
manage
anything
on
the
main
aisle
downstairs
pomeranian
our
millinery
buyer
said
she
had
never
seen
it
better
done
and
she
mixes
with
some
of
the
swellest
people
in
nine
to
six
with
half
an
hour
off
for
lunch
said
the
senior
partner
and
left
the
room
gissing
calmly
swallowed
his
tea
and
ate
the
meringue
he
would
have
enjoyed
another
but
the
capable
secretary
had
already
removed
them
he
poured
himself
a
second
cup
of
tea
beagle
junior
showed
signs
of
eagerness
to
leave
but
gissing
detained
him
one
moment
he
said
suavely
there
is
a
little
matter
that
we
have
not
discussed
the
question
of
beagle
looked
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
thirty
dollars
a
week
he
said
after
all
gissing
thought
it
will
only
take
four
weeks
to
pay
for
what
i
have
spent
on
clothes
chapter
seven
there
was
some
dramatic
nerve
in
gissing
nature
that
responded
eloquently
to
the
floorwalking
job
never
in
the
history
of
beagle
and
company
had
there
been
a
floorwalker
who
threw
so
much
passion
and
zeal
into
his
task
the
very
hang
of
his
coattails
even
the
erect
carriage
of
his
back
the
rubbery
way
in
which
his
feet
trod
the
aisles
showed
his
sense
of
dignity
and
glamour
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
tradition
which
enriched
and
upheld
him
beagle
senior
used
to
stand
on
the
little
balcony
at
the
rear
of
the
main
floor
transfixed
with
the
pleasure
of
seeing
gissing
move
among
the
crowded
passages
alert
watchful
urbane
with
just
the
ideal
blend
of
courtesy
and
condescension
he
raised
floorwalking
to
a
social
art
female
customers
asked
him
the
way
to
departments
they
knew
perfectly
well
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
direct
them
business
began
to
improve
before
he
had
been
there
a
week
and
how
he
enjoyed
himself
the
perfection
of
his
bearing
on
the
floor
was
no
careful
pose
it
was
due
to
the
brimming
overplus
of
his
happiness
happiness
is
surely
the
best
teacher
of
good
manners
only
the
unhappy
are
churlish
in
deportment
he
was
young
remember
and
this
was
his
first
job
his
precocious
experience
as
a
paterfamilias
had
added
to
his
mien
just
that
suggestion
of
unconscious
gravity
which
is
so
appealing
to
ladies
he
looked
they
thought
as
though
he
had
been
touched
but
oh
so
lightly
by
poetic
sorrow
or
strange
experience
to
ask
him
the
way
to
the
notion
counter
was
as
much
of
an
adventure
as
to
meet
a
reigning
actor
at
a
tea
the
faint
cloud
of
melancholy
that
shadowed
his
brow
may
have
been
only
due
to
the
fact
that
his
new
boots
were
pinching
painfully
but
they
did
not
know
that
so
quite
unconsciously
he
began
to
establish
himself
in
his
role
just
as
an
actor
does
at
first
he
felt
his
way
tentatively
and
with
tact
every
store
has
its
own
tone
and
atmosphere
in
a
day
or
so
he
divined
the
characteristic
cachet
of
the
beagle
establishment
he
saw
what
kind
of
customers
were
typical
and
what
sort
of
conduct
they
expected
and
the
secret
of
conquest
being
always
to
give
people
a
little
more
than
they
expect
he
pursued
that
course
since
they
expected
in
a
floorwalker
the
mechanical
and
servile
gentility
of
a
hired
puppet
he
exhibited
the
easy
offhand
simplicity
of
a
fellow
with
perfect
naturalness
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
assist
in
their
shopping
concerns
gave
advice
in
the
selection
of
dress
materials
acted
as
arbiter
in
the
matching
of
frocks
and
stockings
his
taste
being
faultless
it
often
happened
that
the
things
he
recommended
were
not
the
most
expensive
this
again
endeared
him
to
customers
when
sales
slips
were
brought
to
him
by
ladies
who
wished
to
make
an
exchange
he
affixed
his
with
a
magnificent
flourish
and
with
such
evident
pleasure
that
patrons
felt
genuine
elation
and
plunged
into
the
tumult
with
new
enthusiasm
it
was
not
long
before
there
were
always
people
waiting
for
his
counsel
and
husbands
would
appear
at
the
store
to
convey
a
little
irritably
some
such
message
as
mrs
sealyham
says
please
choose
her
a
scarf
that
will
go
nicely
with
that
brown
moire
dress
of
hers
she
says
you
will
remember
the
this
popularity
became
even
a
bit
perplexing
as
for
instance
when
old
dachshund
the
store
biggest
charge
account
insisted
on
his
leaving
his
beat
at
a
very
busy
time
to
go
up
to
the
tenth
floor
to
tell
her
which
piano
he
thought
had
the
richer
tone
of
course
all
this
was
very
entertaining
and
an
admirable
opportunity
for
studying
his
but
it
did
not
go
very
deep
into
his
mind
he
lived
for
some
time
in
a
confused
glamour
and
glitter
surrounded
by
the
fascinating
specious
life
of
the
store
but
drifting
merely
superficially
upon
it
the
great
place
with
its
columns
of
artificial
marble
and
white
censers
of
electricity
glimmered
like
a
birch
forest
by
moonlight
silver
and
jewels
and
silks
and
slippers
flashed
all
about
him
it
was
a
marvellous
education
for
he
soon
learned
to
estimate
these
things
at
their
proper
value
which
is
low
for
they
have
little
to
do
with
life
itself
his
work
was
tiring
in
the
extreme
merely
having
to
remain
upright
on
his
hind
legs
for
such
long
hours
was
an
ordeal
but
it
did
not
penetrate
to
the
secret
observant
self
of
which
he
was
always
aware
this
was
advantageous
if
you
have
no
intellect
or
only
just
enough
to
get
along
with
it
does
not
much
matter
what
you
do
but
if
you
really
have
a
mind
by
which
is
meant
that
rare
and
curious
power
of
reason
of
imagination
and
of
emotion
very
different
from
a
mere
fertility
of
conversation
and
intelligent
curiosity
it
is
better
not
to
weary
and
wear
it
out
over
trifles
so
when
he
left
the
store
in
the
evening
no
matter
how
his
legs
ached
his
head
was
clear
and
untarnished
he
did
not
hurry
away
at
closing
time
places
where
people
work
are
particularly
fascinating
after
the
bustle
is
over
he
loved
to
linger
in
the
long
aisles
to
see
the
tumbled
counters
being
swiftly
brought
to
order
to
hear
the
pungent
cynicisms
of
the
weary
shopgirls
to
these
by
the
way
he
was
a
bit
of
a
mystery
the
punctilio
of
his
manner
the
extreme
courtliness
of
his
remarks
embarrassed
them
a
little
behind
his
back
they
spoke
of
him
as
the
duke
and
admired
him
hugely
little
miss
whippet
at
the
stocking
counter
said
that
he
was
an
english
noble
of
long
pedigree
who
had
been
unjustly
deprived
of
his
estates
down
in
the
basement
of
this
palatial
store
was
a
little
dressing
room
and
lavatory
for
the
floorwalkers
where
they
doffed
their
formal
raiment
and
resumed
street
attire
his
colleagues
grumbled
and
hastened
to
depart
but
gissing
made
himself
entirely
comfortable
in
his
locker
he
kept
a
baby
bathtub
which
he
leisurely
filled
with
hot
water
at
one
of
the
basins
then
he
sat
serenely
and
bathed
his
feet
although
it
was
against
the
rules
he
often
managed
to
smoke
a
pipe
while
doing
so
then
he
hung
up
his
store
clothes
neatly
and
went
off
refreshed
into
the
summer
evening
a
warm
rosy
light
floods
the
city
at
that
hour
at
the
foot
of
every
crosstown
street
is
a
bonfire
of
sunset
what
a
mood
of
secret
smiling
beset
him
as
he
viewed
the
great
territory
of
his
enjoyment
the
freedom
of
the
city
a
phrase
he
had
somewhere
heard
echoed
in
his
mind
the
freedom
of
the
city
a
magnificent
saying
electric
signs
first
burning
wanly
in
the
pink
air
then
brightened
and
grew
strong
not
light
but
rather
darkness
visible
in
that
magic
hour
that
just
holds
the
balance
between
paling
day
and
the
spendthrift
jewellery
of
evening
or
if
it
rained
to
sit
blithely
on
the
roof
of
a
bus
revelling
in
the
gust
and
whipping
of
the
shower
why
had
no
one
told
him
of
the
glory
of
the
city
she
was
pride
she
was
exultation
she
was
madness
she
was
what
he
had
obscurely
craved
in
every
line
of
her
gallant
profile
he
saw
conquest
triumph
victory
empty
conquest
futile
triumph
doomed
victory
but
that
was
the
essence
of
the
drama
in
thunderclaps
of
dumb
ecstasy
he
saw
her
whole
gigantic
fabric
leaning
and
clamouring
upward
with
terrible
yearning
burnt
with
pitiless
sunlight
drenched
with
purple
explosions
of
summer
storm
he
saw
her
cleansed
and
pure
where
were
her
recreant
poets
that
they
had
never
made
these
things
plain
and
then
after
the
senseless
day
after
its
happy
but
meaningless
triviality
the
throng
and
mixed
perfumery
and
silly
courteous
gestures
his
blessed
solitude
oh
solitude
that
noble
peace
of
the
mind
he
loved
the
throng
and
multitude
of
the
day
he
loved
people
but
sometimes
he
suspected
that
he
loved
them
as
god
does
at
a
judicious
distance
from
his
rather
haphazard
religious
training
strange
words
came
back
to
him
for
god
so
loved
the
world
so
loved
the
world
that
that
what
that
he
sent
someone
else
some
day
he
must
think
this
out
but
you
ca
think
things
out
they
think
themselves
suddenly
amazingly
the
city
itself
is
god
he
cried
was
not
ultimate
promise
something
about
a
city
the
city
of
god
well
but
that
was
only
symbolic
language
the
city
of
course
that
was
only
a
symbol
for
the
race
for
all
his
kind
the
entire
species
the
whole
aspiration
and
passion
and
struggle
that
was
god
on
the
ferries
at
night
after
supper
was
his
favourite
place
for
meditation
some
undeniable
instinct
drew
him
ever
and
again
out
of
the
deep
and
shut
ravines
of
stone
to
places
where
he
could
feed
on
distance
that
is
one
of
the
subtleties
of
this
straight
and
narrow
city
that
though
her
ways
are
cliffed
in
they
are
a
long
thoroughfare
for
the
eye
there
is
always
a
far
perspective
but
best
of
all
to
go
down
to
her
environing
water
where
spaces
are
wide
the
openness
that
keeps
her
sound
and
free
ships
had
words
for
him
they
had
crossed
many
horizons
fragments
of
that
broken
blue
still
shone
on
their
cutting
bows
ferries
the
most
poetical
things
in
the
city
were
nearly
empty
at
night
he
stood
by
the
rail
saw
the
black
outline
of
the
town
slide
by
saw
the
lower
sky
gilded
with
her
merriment
and
was
busy
thinking
now
about
a
god
he
said
to
himself
instinct
tells
me
that
there
is
one
for
when
i
think
about
him
i
find
that
i
unconsciously
wag
my
tail
a
little
but
i
must
not
reason
on
that
basis
which
is
too
puppyish
i
like
to
think
that
there
is
somewhere
in
this
universe
an
inscrutable
being
of
infinite
wisdom
harmony
and
charity
by
whom
all
my
desires
and
needs
would
be
understood
in
association
with
whom
i
would
find
peace
satisfaction
a
lightness
of
heart
that
exceed
my
present
understanding
such
a
being
is
to
me
quite
inconceivable
yet
i
feel
that
if
i
met
him
i
would
instantly
understand
i
do
not
mean
that
i
would
understand
him
but
i
would
understand
my
relationship
to
him
which
would
be
perfect
nor
do
i
mean
that
it
would
be
always
happy
merely
that
it
would
transcend
anything
in
the
way
of
social
significance
that
i
now
experience
but
i
must
not
conclude
that
there
is
such
a
god
merely
because
it
would
be
so
pleasant
if
there
were
then
he
continued
is
it
necessary
to
conceive
that
this
deity
is
in
essence
what
i
am
getting
at
is
this
in
everyone
i
have
ever
known
fuji
poodle
spaniel
those
maddening
delightful
puppies
purp
beagle
even
chow
and
sealyham
and
little
miss
whippet
i
have
always
been
aware
that
there
was
some
mysterious
point
of
union
at
which
our
minds
could
converge
and
entirely
understand
one
another
no
matter
what
our
difference
of
breed
of
training
of
experience
and
education
provided
we
could
meet
and
exchange
ideas
honestly
there
would
be
some
satisfying
point
of
mental
fusion
where
we
would
feel
our
solidarity
in
the
common
mystery
of
life
people
complain
that
wars
are
caused
by
and
fought
over
trivial
things
why
of
course
for
it
is
only
in
trivial
matters
that
people
differ
in
the
deep
realities
they
must
necessarily
be
at
one
now
i
have
a
suspicion
that
in
this
secret
sense
of
unity
god
may
lurk
is
that
what
we
mean
by
god
the
sum
total
of
all
these
instinctive
understandings
but
what
is
the
origin
of
this
sense
of
kinship
is
it
not
the
realization
of
our
common
subjection
to
laws
and
forces
greater
than
ourselves
then
since
nothing
can
be
greater
than
god
he
must
be
these
superior
mysteries
yet
he
can
not
be
greater
than
our
minds
for
our
minds
have
imagined
him
my
mathematics
is
very
rusty
he
said
to
himself
but
i
seem
to
remember
something
about
a
locus
which
was
a
curve
or
a
surface
every
point
on
which
satisfied
some
particular
equation
of
relation
among
the
coordinates
it
begins
to
look
to
me
as
though
life
might
be
a
kind
of
locus
whose
commanding
equation
we
call
god
the
points
on
that
locus
can
not
conceive
of
the
equation
yet
they
are
subject
to
it
they
can
not
conceive
of
that
equation
because
of
course
it
has
no
existence
save
as
a
law
of
their
being
it
exists
only
for
them
they
only
by
it
but
there
it
is
a
perfect
potent
divine
abstraction
this
carried
him
into
a
realm
of
disembodied
thinking
which
his
mind
was
not
sufficiently
disciplined
to
summarize
it
is
quite
plain
he
said
to
himself
that
i
must
rub
up
my
vanished
mathematics
for
certainly
the
mathematician
comes
closer
to
god
than
any
other
since
his
mind
is
trained
to
conceive
and
formulate
the
magnificent
phantoms
of
legality
he
smiled
to
think
that
any
one
should
presume
to
become
a
parson
without
having
at
least
mastered
analytical
geometry
the
ferry
had
crossed
and
recrossed
the
river
several
times
but
gissing
had
found
no
conclusion
for
these
thoughts
as
the
boat
drew
toward
her
slip
she
passed
astern
of
a
great
liner
gissing
saw
the
four
tall
funnels
loom
up
above
the
shed
of
the
pier
where
she
lay
berthed
what
was
it
that
made
his
heart
so
stir
the
perfect
rake
of
the
funnels
just
that
satisfying
angle
of
slant
that
absurdly
enough
was
the
nobility
of
the
sight
why
then
let
get
at
the
heart
of
this
he
said
just
that
little
trick
of
the
architect
useless
in
itself
what
was
it
but
the
touch
of
swagger
of
bravado
of
defiance
going
out
into
the
vast
meaningless
unpitying
sea
with
that
dainty
arrogance
of
build
taking
the
trouble
to
mock
the
senseless
elements
hurricane
ice
and
fog
with
a
slope
of
masts
and
funnels
damn
what
was
the
analogy
it
was
pride
it
was
pride
it
was
the
same
lusty
impudence
that
he
saw
in
his
perfect
city
the
city
that
cried
out
to
the
hearts
of
youth
jutted
her
mocking
pinnacles
toward
sky
her
clumsy
turrets
verticalled
on
gold
and
god
the
god
of
gales
and
gravity
loved
his
children
to
dare
and
contradict
him
to
rally
him
with
equations
of
their
own
god
i
defy
you
he
cried
chapter
eight
time
is
a
flowing
river
happy
those
who
allow
themselves
to
be
carried
unresisting
with
the
current
they
float
through
easy
days
they
live
unquestioning
in
the
moment
but
gissing
was
acutely
conscious
of
time
though
not
subtle
enough
to
analyze
the
matter
acutely
he
had
a
troublesome
feeling
about
it
he
kept
checking
off
a
series
of
nows
now
i
am
having
my
bath
he
would
say
to
himself
in
the
morning
now
i
am
dressing
now
i
am
on
the
way
to
the
store
now
i
am
in
the
jewellery
aisle
being
polite
to
customers
now
i
am
having
after
a
period
in
which
time
ran
by
unnoticed
he
would
suddenly
realize
a
fresh
now
and
feel
uneasy
at
the
knowledge
that
it
would
shortly
dissolve
into
another
one
he
tried
vainly
to
swim
against
the
smooth
impalpable
fatal
current
he
tried
to
dam
up
time
to
deepen
the
stream
so
that
he
could
bathe
in
it
carelessly
time
he
said
is
life
and
life
is
god
time
then
is
little
bits
of
god
those
who
waste
their
time
in
vulgarity
or
folly
are
the
true
atheists
one
of
the
things
that
struck
him
about
the
city
was
its
heedlessness
of
time
on
every
side
he
saw
people
spending
it
without
adequate
return
perhaps
he
was
young
and
doctrinaire
but
he
devised
this
theory
for
himself
all
time
is
wasted
that
does
not
give
you
some
awareness
of
beauty
or
wonder
in
other
words
the
days
that
make
us
happy
make
us
wise
he
said
to
himself
quoting
masefield
line
on
that
principle
he
asked
how
much
time
is
wasted
in
this
city
well
here
are
some
six
million
people
to
simplify
the
problem
which
is
permitted
to
every
philosopher
let
us
he
said
assume
that
of
those
people
have
spent
a
day
that
could
be
called
on
the
whole
happy
a
day
in
which
they
have
had
glimpses
of
reality
a
day
in
which
they
feel
satisfaction
that
was
he
felt
a
generous
allowance
very
well
then
that
leaves
people
whose
day
has
been
unfruitful
spent
in
uncongenial
work
or
in
sorrow
suffering
and
talking
nonsense
this
city
then
in
one
day
has
wasted
years
or
centuries
one
hundred
centuries
squandered
in
a
day
it
made
him
feel
quite
ill
and
he
tore
up
the
scrap
of
paper
on
which
he
had
been
figuring
this
was
a
new
disconcerting
way
to
think
of
the
subject
we
are
accustomed
to
consider
time
only
as
it
applies
to
ourselves
forgetting
that
it
is
working
upon
everyone
else
simultaneously
why
he
thought
with
a
sudden
shock
if
only
people
in
this
city
have
had
a
thoroughly
spendthrift
and
useless
day
that
means
a
net
loss
of
a
century
if
the
war
he
said
to
himself
lasted
over
days
and
involved
more
than
men
how
many
aeons
he
used
to
think
about
these
things
during
quiet
evenings
in
the
room
at
purp
occasionally
he
went
home
at
night
still
wearing
his
store
clothes
because
it
pleased
good
purp
so
much
she
felt
that
it
added
glamour
to
her
house
to
have
him
do
so
and
always
called
her
husband
a
frightened
silent
creature
with
no
collar
and
a
humble
air
up
from
the
basement
to
admire
purp
time
gissing
suspected
was
irretrievably
wasted
a
good
deal
of
it
to
judge
by
his
dusty
appearance
in
rolling
around
in
ashcans
or
in
the
company
of
the
neighbourhood
bootlegger
but
then
he
reflected
in
a
charitable
seizure
you
must
not
judge
other
people
by
a
calculus
of
your
own
perhaps
he
himself
was
growing
a
little
miserly
in
this
matter
indulging
in
the
rare
the
sovereign
luxury
of
thinking
he
had
suddenly
become
aware
of
time
precious
fluency
and
wondered
why
everyone
else
did
think
about
it
as
passionately
as
he
did
in
the
privacy
of
his
room
weary
after
the
day
afoot
he
took
off
his
cutaway
coat
and
trousers
and
enjoyed
his
old
habit
of
stretching
out
on
the
floor
for
a
good
rest
there
he
would
lie
not
asleep
but
in
a
bliss
of
passive
meditation
he
even
grudged
purp
the
little
chats
she
loved
she
made
a
point
of
coming
up
with
clean
towels
when
she
knew
he
was
in
his
room
because
she
cherished
hearing
him
talk
when
he
heard
her
knock
he
had
to
scramble
hastily
to
his
feet
get
on
his
clothes
and
pretend
he
had
been
sitting
calmly
in
the
rocking
chair
it
would
never
do
to
let
her
find
him
sprawled
on
the
floor
she
had
an
almost
painful
respect
for
him
once
when
prospective
lodgers
were
bargaining
for
rooms
and
he
happened
to
be
wearing
his
beagle
and
company
attire
she
had
asked
him
to
do
her
the
favour
of
walking
down
the
stairs
so
that
the
visitors
might
be
impressed
by
the
gentility
of
the
establishment
of
course
he
loved
to
waste
time
but
in
his
own
way
he
gloated
on
the
irresponsible
vacancy
of
those
evening
hours
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
lay
very
still
hardly
even
thinking
just
feeling
life
go
by
through
the
open
window
came
the
lights
and
noises
of
the
street
already
his
domestic
life
seemed
dim
and
far
away
the
shrill
appeals
of
the
puppies
their
appalling
innocent
comments
on
existence
came
but
faintly
to
memory
here
where
life
beat
so
much
more
thickly
and
closely
was
the
place
to
be
though
he
had
solved
nothing
yet
he
seemed
closer
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
entranced
he
felt
time
flowing
on
toward
him
endless
in
sweep
and
fulness
there
is
only
one
success
he
said
to
himself
to
be
able
to
spend
your
life
in
your
own
way
and
not
to
give
others
absurd
maddening
claims
upon
it
youth
youth
is
the
only
wealth
for
youth
has
time
in
its
purse
in
the
store
however
philosophy
was
laid
aside
a
kind
of
intoxication
possessed
him
never
before
had
old
beagle
watching
delightedly
from
the
mezzanine
balcony
seen
such
a
floorwalker
gissing
moved
to
and
fro
exulting
in
the
great
tide
of
shopping
he
knew
all
the
best
customers
by
name
and
had
learned
their
peculiarities
if
a
shower
came
up
and
mastiff
was
just
leaving
he
hastened
to
give
her
his
arm
as
far
as
her
limousine
boosting
her
in
so
expeditiously
that
not
a
drop
of
wetness
fell
upon
her
he
took
care
to
find
out
the
special
plat
du
jour
of
the
store
lunch
room
and
seized
occasion
to
whisper
to
dachshund
whose
weakness
was
food
that
the
filet
of
sole
was
very
nice
pomeranian
learned
that
giving
gissing
a
hint
about
some
new
parisian
importations
was
more
effective
than
a
half
page
ad
in
the
sunday
papers
within
a
few
hours
by
a
judicious
word
here
and
there
he
would
have
a
score
of
ladies
hastening
to
the
millinery
salon
a
pearl
necklace
of
great
value
which
beagle
had
rebuked
the
jewellery
buyer
for
getting
because
it
seemed
more
appropriate
for
a
dealer
in
precious
stones
than
for
a
department
store
was
disposed
of
almost
at
once
gissing
casually
told
mastiff
that
he
had
heard
sealyham
intended
to
buy
it
as
for
dachshund
who
had
had
a
habit
of
lunching
at
delmonico
she
now
was
to
be
seen
taking
tiffin
at
beagle
almost
daily
there
were
many
husbands
who
would
have
been
glad
to
shoot
him
at
sight
on
the
first
of
the
month
had
they
known
who
was
the
real
cause
of
their
woe
indeed
gissing
had
raised
floorwalking
to
a
new
level
he
was
more
prime
minister
than
a
mere
patroller
of
aisles
with
sparkling
eye
with
unending
curiosity
tact
and
attention
he
moved
quietly
among
the
throng
he
realized
that
shopping
is
the
female
paradise
that
spending
money
she
has
not
earned
is
the
only
real
fun
an
elderly
and
wealthy
lady
can
have
and
if
to
this
primitive
shopping
passion
can
be
added
the
delights
of
social
amenity
flattery
courtesy
flirtation
the
snare
is
complete
but
all
this
is
not
accomplished
without
rousing
the
jealousy
of
rivals
among
the
other
floorwalkers
and
particularly
in
the
gorgeously
uniformed
attendant
at
the
front
door
who
was
outraged
by
habit
of
escorting
special
customers
to
their
motors
moved
anger
envy
and
sneers
gissing
completely
absorbed
in
the
fascination
of
his
work
was
unaware
of
this
hostility
as
he
was
equally
unaware
of
the
amazed
satisfaction
of
his
employer
he
went
his
way
with
naive
and
unconscious
pleasure
it
did
not
take
long
for
his
enemies
to
find
a
fulcrum
for
their
chagrin
one
evening
after
closing
when
he
sat
in
the
dressing
room
with
his
feet
in
the
usual
tub
of
hot
water
placidly
reviewing
the
day
excitements
and
smoking
his
pipe
the
superintendent
burst
in
hey
he
exclaimed
do
you
know
smoking
forbidden
what
do
you
want
to
do
get
our
fire
insurance
cancelled
get
out
of
here
fired
it
did
not
occur
to
gissing
to
question
or
protest
he
had
known
perfectly
well
that
smoking
was
not
allowed
but
he
was
like
the
stage
hand
behind
the
scenes
who
concluded
it
was
all
right
to
light
a
cigarette
because
the
sign
only
said
smoking
forbidden
instead
of
smoking
strictly
forbidden
he
had
not
troubled
his
mind
about
it
one
way
or
about
it
one
way
or
another
he
had
drawn
his
salary
that
evening
and
his
first
thought
was
well
at
any
rate
i
earned
enough
to
pay
for
the
clothes
he
had
been
there
exactly
four
weeks
quite
calmly
he
lifted
his
feet
out
of
the
tub
and
began
to
towel
them
daintily
the
meticulous
way
he
dried
between
his
toes
was
infuriating
to
the
superintendent
have
you
any
children
gissing
asked
mildly
what
that
to
you
snapped
the
other
i
sell
you
this
bathtub
for
a
quarter
take
it
home
to
them
they
probably
need
you
get
out
of
here
cried
the
angry
official
you
be
surprised
said
gissing
how
children
thrive
when
bathed
regularly
believe
me
i
he
packed
his
formal
clothes
in
a
neat
bundle
left
the
bathtub
behind
surrendered
his
locker
key
and
walked
toward
the
employees
door
escorted
by
his
bristling
superior
as
they
passed
through
the
empty
aisles
scene
of
his
brief
triumph
he
could
not
help
gazing
a
little
sadly
true
merchant
to
the
last
a
thought
struck
him
he
scribbled
a
note
on
the
back
of
a
sales
slip
and
left
it
at
miss
whippet
post
by
the
stocking
counter
it
said
miss
whippet
show
sealyham
some
of
the
bisque
sports
hose
scotch
wool
size
she
coming
do
let
her
get
size
they
shrink
gissing
at
the
door
he
paused
relit
his
pipe
leisurely
raised
his
hat
to
the
superintendent
and
strolled
away
in
spite
of
this
nonchalance
the
situation
was
serious
his
money
was
at
a
low
ebb
all
his
regular
income
was
diverted
to
the
support
of
the
large
household
in
the
country
he
was
too
proud
to
appeal
to
his
wealthy
uncle
he
hated
also
to
think
of
purp
mortification
if
she
learned
that
her
star
boarder
was
out
of
work
by
a
curious
irony
when
he
got
home
he
found
a
letter
from
spaniel
gishing
dere
friend
the
pupeys
are
well
no
insecks
and
eat
with
nives
and
forx
groups
is
the
fattest
but
yelpers
is
the
lowdest
they
send
wags
and
lix
and
glad
to
here
daddy
is
doing
so
well
in
buisness
with
respects
from
spaniel
he
did
not
let
purp
know
of
the
change
in
his
condition
and
every
morning
left
his
lodging
at
the
usual
time
by
some
curious
attraction
he
felt
drawn
to
that
downtown
region
where
his
kinsman
office
was
this
part
of
the
city
he
had
not
properly
explored
it
was
a
world
wholly
different
from
fifth
avenue
there
was
none
of
that
sense
of
space
and
luxury
he
had
known
on
the
wide
slopes
of
murray
hill
he
wandered
under
terrific
buildings
in
a
breezy
shadow
where
javelins
of
colourless
sunlight
pierced
through
thin
slits
hot
brilliance
fell
in
fans
and
cascades
over
the
uneven
terrace
of
roofs
here
was
where
husbands
worked
to
keep
fifth
avenue
going
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
sealyham
had
bought
those
stockings
one
day
he
saw
his
uncle
hurrying
along
wall
street
with
an
intent
face
gissing
skipped
into
a
doorway
fearing
to
be
recognized
he
knew
that
the
old
fellow
would
insist
on
taking
him
to
lunch
at
the
pedigree
club
would
talk
endlessly
and
ask
family
questions
but
he
was
on
the
scent
of
matters
that
talk
could
not
pursue
he
perceived
a
sense
of
pressure
of
prodigious
poetry
and
beauty
and
amazement
this
was
a
strange
jungle
of
life
tall
coasts
of
windows
stood
up
into
the
pure
brilliant
sky
against
their
feet
beat
a
dark
surf
of
slums
in
one
foreign
street
too
deeply
trenched
for
sunlight
oranges
were
the
only
gold
the
water
reaching
round
in
two
arms
came
close
there
was
a
note
of
husky
summons
in
the
whistles
of
passing
craft
almost
everywhere
sharp
above
many
smells
of
oils
and
spices
the
whiff
of
coffee
tingled
his
busy
nose
above
one
huge
precipice
stood
a
gilded
statue
a
boy
with
wings
burning
in
the
noon
brilliance
flamed
between
the
vanes
of
his
pinions
the
intangible
thrust
of
that
pouring
light
seemed
about
to
hover
him
off
into
blue
air
the
world
of
working
husbands
was
more
tender
than
that
of
shopping
wives
even
in
all
their
business
they
had
left
space
and
quietness
for
the
dead
sunken
among
the
crags
he
found
two
graveyards
they
were
cups
of
placid
brightness
here
looking
upward
it
was
like
being
drowned
on
the
floor
of
an
ocean
of
light
husbands
had
built
their
offices
to
the
sky
rather
than
disturb
these
perhaps
they
appreciate
rest
all
the
more
gissing
thought
because
they
get
so
little
of
it
somehow
he
could
not
quite
imagine
a
graveyard
left
at
peace
in
the
shopping
district
it
would
be
bad
for
trade
perhaps
even
the
churches
on
the
avenue
he
had
noticed
were
huddled
up
and
hemmed
in
so
tightly
by
the
other
buildings
that
they
had
scarcely
room
to
kneel
if
i
ever
become
a
parson
he
said
this
was
a
fantastic
dream
of
his
i
will
insist
that
all
churches
must
have
a
girdle
of
green
about
them
to
set
them
apart
from
the
world
the
two
little
brown
churches
among
the
cliffs
had
been
gifted
with
a
dignity
far
beyond
the
dream
of
their
builders
their
pointing
spires
were
relieved
against
the
enormous
facades
of
business
what
other
altars
ever
had
such
a
reredos
above
the
strepitant
racket
of
the
streets
he
heard
the
harsh
chimes
of
trinity
at
noonday
strong
jags
of
clangour
hurled
against
the
great
of
buildings
drifting
and
dying
away
down
side
alleys
there
was
no
soft
music
of
appeal
in
the
bronze
volleying
it
was
the
hoarse
monitory
voice
of
rebuke
so
spoke
the
church
of
old
he
thought
not
asking
not
appealing
but
imperatively
sternly
as
one
born
to
command
he
thought
with
new
respect
of
sealyham
mastiff
dachshund
all
the
others
who
were
powers
in
these
fantastic
flumes
of
stone
they
were
more
than
merely
husbands
of
charge
accounts
they
were
poets
they
sat
at
lunch
on
the
tops
of
their
amazing
edifices
and
looked
off
at
the
blue
day
after
day
went
by
but
with
a
serene
fatalism
gissing
did
nothing
about
hunting
a
job
he
was
willing
to
wait
until
the
last
dollar
was
broken
in
the
meantime
he
was
content
you
never
know
the
soul
of
a
city
he
said
until
you
are
down
on
your
luck
now
he
felt
he
had
been
here
long
enough
to
understand
her
she
did
not
give
her
secrets
to
the
world
of
fifth
avenue
down
here
where
the
deep
crevice
of
broadway
opened
out
into
greenness
what
was
the
first
thing
he
saw
out
across
the
harbour
turned
toward
open
sea
liberty
liberty
enlightening
the
world
he
had
heard
was
her
full
name
some
had
mocked
her
he
had
also
heard
well
what
was
the
gist
of
her
enlightenment
why
this
surely
that
liberty
could
never
be
more
than
a
statue
never
a
reality
only
a
fool
would
expect
complete
liberty
he
himself
with
all
his
latitude
was
not
free
if
he
were
he
would
cook
his
meals
in
his
room
and
save
money
but
purp
was
strict
on
that
point
she
had
spoken
scathingly
of
two
young
females
she
ejected
for
just
that
reason
nor
was
purp
free
she
was
ridden
by
the
gas
company
so
it
went
it
struck
him
now
he
was
down
to
about
three
dollars
that
a
generous
gesture
toward
fortune
might
be
valuable
when
you
are
nearly
out
of
money
he
reasoned
to
toss
coins
to
the
gods
to
buy
something
quite
unnecessary
may
be
propitiatory
it
may
start
something
moving
in
your
direction
it
is
the
touch
of
bravado
that
god
relishes
in
a
sudden
mood
of
tenderness
he
bought
two
dollars
worth
of
toys
and
had
them
sent
to
the
children
he
smiled
to
think
how
they
would
frolic
over
the
jumping
rabbit
he
sent
spaniel
a
postcard
of
the
aquarium
there
is
a
good
deal
more
to
this
business
than
i
had
realized
he
said
as
he
walked
uptown
through
the
east
side
slums
that
hot
night
the
audacity
the
vitality
the
magnificence
are
plain
enough
but
i
seem
to
see
squalor
too
horror
and
pitiful
dearth
i
believe
god
is
farther
off
than
i
thought
look
here
if
the
more
you
know
the
less
you
know
about
god
does
that
mean
that
god
is
really
enjoyed
only
by
the
completely
simple
by
faith
never
by
reason
he
gave
cents
to
a
beggar
and
said
angrily
i
am
not
interested
in
a
god
who
is
known
only
by
when
he
got
uptown
he
was
very
tired
and
hungry
in
spite
of
all
purp
rules
he
smuggled
in
an
egg
a
box
of
biscuits
a
small
packet
of
tea
and
sugar
and
a
tin
of
condensed
milk
he
emptied
the
milk
into
his
shaving
mug
and
used
the
tin
to
boil
water
in
holding
it
over
the
gas
jet
he
was
getting
on
finely
when
a
sudden
knock
on
the
door
made
him
jump
he
spilled
the
hot
water
on
his
leg
and
uttered
a
wild
yell
purp
burst
in
but
she
was
so
excited
that
she
did
not
notice
the
egg
seeping
into
the
clean
counterpane
oh
gissing
she
exclaimed
i
been
waiting
all
evening
for
you
to
come
in
purp
and
i
wondered
if
you
seen
this
in
the
paper
purp
noticed
it
in
the
but
we
could
understand
what
it
she
held
out
a
page
of
classified
advertising
in
which
he
read
with
amazement
personal
if
gissing
late
floorwalker
at
beagle
and
company
will
communicate
with
beagle
senior
he
will
hear
matters
greatly
to
his
advantage
chapter
nine
there
had
been
great
excitement
in
the
private
offices
of
beagle
and
company
after
gissing
sudden
disappearance
old
beagle
was
furious
and
hotly
scolded
his
son
in
spite
of
his
advanced
age
beagle
senior
was
still
an
autocrat
and
insisted
on
regulating
the
details
of
the
great
business
he
had
built
up
you
numbskull
he
shouted
to
beagle
junior
that
fellow
was
worth
any
dozen
others
in
the
place
and
you
let
him
be
fired
by
a
mongrel
but
papa
protested
the
the
superintendent
had
to
obey
the
rules
you
know
how
strict
the
underwriters
are
about
smoking
of
course
he
should
have
warned
gissing
instead
of
discharging
rules
interrupted
old
beagle
fiercely
rules
do
apply
in
a
case
like
this
i
tell
you
that
fellow
has
a
genius
for
storekeeping
i
watched
him
on
the
floor
i
never
seen
one
like
him
what
the
good
of
your
newfangled
methods
your
card
indexes
and
overhead
charts
when
you
have
even
got
a
record
of
his
address
growling
and
showing
his
teeth
the
head
of
the
firm
plodded
stiffly
downstairs
and
discharged
the
superintendent
himself
already
he
saw
signs
of
disorganization
in
the
main
aisle
miss
whippet
was
tearful
customers
were
waiting
impatiently
to
have
exchange
slips
dachshund
was
turning
over
some
jewelled
lorgnettes
but
it
was
plain
that
she
was
only
looking
and
had
no
intention
to
purchase
so
when
after
many
vain
inquiries
the
advertisement
reached
its
target
the
old
gentleman
welcomed
gissing
with
genuine
emotion
he
received
him
into
his
private
office
locked
the
door
and
produced
a
decanter
evidently
beneath
his
irritable
moods
he
had
sensibilities
of
his
own
i
have
given
my
life
to
trade
he
said
and
i
have
grown
weary
of
watching
the
simpletons
who
imagine
they
can
rise
to
the
top
by
thinking
more
about
themselves
than
they
do
about
the
business
you
gissing
have
won
my
heart
you
see
storekeeping
as
i
do
a
fine
art
an
absorbing
passion
a
beautiful
thrilling
sport
it
is
an
art
as
lovely
and
subtle
as
the
theatre
with
the
same
skill
in
wooing
and
charming
the
gissing
bowed
and
drank
beagle
health
to
cover
his
astonishment
the
aged
merchant
fixed
him
with
a
glittering
eye
i
can
see
that
storekeeping
is
your
genius
in
life
i
can
see
that
you
are
naturally
consecrated
to
it
my
son
is
a
good
steady
fellow
but
he
lacks
the
divine
gift
i
am
getting
old
we
need
new
fire
new
brains
in
the
conduct
of
this
business
i
ask
you
to
forgive
the
unlucky
blunder
we
made
lately
and
devote
yourself
to
gissing
was
very
much
embarrassed
he
wanted
to
say
that
if
he
was
going
to
consecrate
himself
to
floorwalking
he
would
relish
a
raise
in
salary
but
old
beagle
was
so
tremulous
and
kept
blowing
his
nose
so
loudly
that
gissing
doubted
if
he
could
make
himself
heard
i
want
you
to
take
a
position
as
general
manager
said
beagle
with
a
salary
of
ten
thousand
a
he
rose
and
threw
open
a
mahogany
door
that
led
out
of
his
own
sanctum
here
is
your
office
he
said
the
bewildered
gissing
looked
about
the
room
the
mahogany
desk
with
a
great
sheet
of
plate
glass
shining
greenly
at
its
thick
edges
an
inkwell
pens
and
pencils
a
little
glass
bowl
full
of
bright
one
of
those
rocking
blotters
that
are
so
tempting
a
water
cooler
which
just
then
uttered
a
seductive
gulping
bubble
an
electric
fan
gently
humming
wooden
trays
for
letters
and
memoranda
on
one
wall
a
great
chart
of
names
lettered
organization
of
personnel
a
nice
stand
a
soft
green
rug
ah
how
alluring
it
all
was
beagle
pointed
to
the
outer
door
of
the
room
which
had
a
frosted
pane
through
the
glass
the
astounded
floorwalker
could
read
the
words
reganam
lareneg
what
a
delightful
little
room
to
meditate
in
from
the
broad
windows
he
could
see
the
whole
shining
tideway
of
fifth
avenue
passing
lazily
in
the
warm
sunlight
he
turned
to
beagle
greatly
moved
the
next
day
an
advertisement
appeared
in
the
leading
papers
to
this
effect
beagle
and
company
take
pleasure
in
announcing
to
their
patrons
and
friends
that
gissing
has
been
admitted
to
the
firm
in
the
status
of
general
manager
je
maintiendrai
purp
excitement
at
this
is
easier
imagined
than
described
her
only
fear
was
that
now
she
would
lose
her
best
lodger
she
made
purp
go
out
and
buy
a
new
shirt
and
a
collar
she
told
gissing
rather
pathetically
that
she
intended
to
have
the
whole
house
repapered
in
the
fall
the
big
double
suite
downstairs
which
could
be
used
as
bedroom
and
she
suggested
as
a
comfortable
change
but
gissing
preferred
to
remain
where
he
was
he
had
grown
fond
of
the
top
floor
certainly
there
was
an
exhilaration
in
his
new
importance
and
prosperity
the
store
buzzed
with
the
news
at
his
request
miss
whippet
was
promoted
to
the
seventh
floor
to
be
his
secretary
it
was
delightful
to
make
his
morning
tour
of
inspection
through
the
vast
building
hound
the
store
detective
loved
to
tell
his
cronies
how
suspiciously
he
had
followed
the
duke
that
first
day
as
gissing
moved
through
the
busy
departments
he
saw
eyes
following
him
tails
wagging
customers
were
more
flattered
than
ever
by
his
courteous
attentions
one
day
he
even
held
a
little
luncheon
party
in
the
restaurant
at
which
dachshund
mastiff
and
sealyham
were
his
guests
he
invited
their
husbands
but
the
latter
were
too
busy
to
come
it
would
have
been
more
prudent
of
them
to
attend
that
afternoon
dachshund
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
bought
a
platinum
mastiff
bought
a
diamond
sealyham
whose
husband
was
temporarily
embarrassed
in
wall
street
contented
herself
with
a
sheraton
chifforobe
but
it
began
to
be
evident
that
his
delightful
little
office
was
not
going
to
be
a
shrine
for
quiet
meditation
his
vanity
had
been
pleased
by
the
large
advertisement
about
him
but
he
suddenly
realized
the
poison
that

little
miss
whippet
although
she
was
fast
at
typewriting
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
up
with
his
correspondence
she
quivered
eagerly
over
her
machine
her
small
paws
flying
new
pink
ribbons
gleamed
through
her
translucent
summery
georgette
blouse
they
were
her
flag
of
exultation
at
her
surprising
rise
in
life
she
felt
it
was
immensely
important
to
get
all
these
letters
answered
promptly
and
so
did
gissing
in
his
new
zeal
and
in
his
innocent
satisfaction
at
having
entered
the
inner
circle
of
big
business
he
insisted
on
answering
everything
he
did
not
realize
that
dictating
letters
is
the
quaint
diversion
of
business
men
and
that
most
of
them
mean
nothing
it
is
simply
the
easiest
way
of
assuring
yourself
that
you
are
busy
this
job
was
no
sinecure
old
beagle
had
so
much
affectionate
confidence
in
gissing
that
he
referred
almost
everything
to
him
for
decision
beagle
junior
perhaps
a
little
annoyed
at
the
floorwalker
meteoric
translation
spent
the
summer
afternoons
at
golf
the
infinite
details
of
a
great
business
crowded
upon
him
inexperienced
he
had
not
learned
the
ways
in
which
seasoned
executives
protect
themselves
against
useless
intrusion
his
telephone
buzzed
like
a
hornet
not
five
minutes
went
by
without
callers
or
interruptions
of
some
sort
most
amazing
of
all
he
found
was
the
miscellaneous
passion
for
palaver
displayed
by
big
business
immediately
he
was
invited
to
join
innumerable
clubs
societies

every
day

embossed

will
be
listening
new
to
the
strange
and
world
of
executives
it
was
natural
that
gissing
did
not
realize
that
the
net
importance
of
this
kind
of
thing
was
absolute
zero
it
did
strike
him
as
odd
perhaps
that
merchants
did
not
dare
to
go
on
a
junket
or
plan
a
congenial
dinner
without
pretending
to
themselves
that
it
had
some
business
significance
but
having
been
so
amazingly
lifted
into
this
atmosphere
of
great
affairs
he
felt
it
was
his
duty
to
the
store
to
play
the
game
according
to
the
established
rules
he
was
borne
along
on
a
roaring
spate
of
conferences
telephone
calls
appointments
rotarian
lunches
chamber
of
commerce
dinners
picnics
to
talk
tariff
to
discuss
demurrage
tennis
tournaments
to
settle
the
golf
foursomes
to
regulate
of
all
these
matters
he
knew
nothing
whatever
and
he
also
saw
that
as
far
as
the
business
of
beagle
and
company
was
concerned
it
would
be
better
not
to
waste
his
time
on
such
the
way
he
could
really
be
of
service
was
in
the
store
itself
tactfully
lubricating
that
complicated
engine
of
goods
and
personalities
but
he
learned
to
utter
when
called
upon
a
few
suave
generalities
barbed
with
a
rollicking
story
this
made
him
always
welcome
he
was
of
a
studious
disposition
and
liked
to
examine
this
queer
territory
of
life
with
an
unprejudiced
eye
after
all
his
inward
secret
purpose
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
success
or
failure
of
retail
trade
he
was
still
seeking
a
horizon
that
would
stay
blue
when
he
reached
it
more
and
more
he
was
interested
to
perceive
how
transparent
the
mummery
of
business
was
he
was
interested
to
note
how
persistently
men
fled
from
success
how
carefully
most
of
them
avoided
the
obvious
principles
of
utility
honesty
prudence
and
courtesy
which
are
inevitably
rewarded
these
sagacious
humorous
fellows
who
were
amusing
themselves
with
twaddling
trade
apothegms
and
ridiculous
banqueteering
solemnities
surely
they
were
aware
that
this
had
no
bearing
upon
their
own
jobs
he
suspected
that
it
was
all
a
feverish
anodyne
to
still
some
inward
unease
since
they
must
not
being
fools
be
aware
that
these
antics
were
mere
subtraction
of
time
from
their
business
the
obvious
conclusion
was
they
were
not
happy
with
business
there
was
some
strange
wistfulness
in
the
conduct
of
big
business
dogs
he
thought
under
the
pretence
of
transacting
affairs
they
were
really
trying
to
discover
something
that
had
eluded
them
the
same
thing
strangely
enough
seemed
to
be
going
on
in
a
sphere
of
which
he
knew
nothing
the
world
of
art
he
gathered
from
the
papers
that
writers
painters
musicians
were
holding
shindies
almost
every
night
at
which
delightful
rebels
too
busy
to
occupy
themselves
with
actual
creation
talked
charmingly
about
their
plans
poets
were
reading
poems
incessantly
forgetting
to
write
any
much
of
the
newspaper
comment
on
literature
made
him
shudder
for
though
this
was
a
province
quite
strange
to
him
he
had
sound
instincts
he
discerned
fatal
ignorance
and
absurdity
between
the
pompous
lines
yet
in
its
own
way
it
seemed
a
bold
and
honest
ignorance
were
these
too
like
the
wistful
executives
seeking
where
the
blue
begins
but
what
was
this
strange
agitation
that
forbade
his
from
enjoying
the
one
thing
that
makes
achievement
possible
solitude
he
himself
so
happy
to
be
left
alone
was
no
one
else
like
that
and
yet
this
very
solitude
that
he
craved
and
revelled
in
was
by
a
sublime
paradox
haunted
by
mysterious
loneliness
he
felt
sometimes
as
though
his
heart
had
been
broken
off
from
some
great
whole
to
which
it
yearned
to
be
reunited
it
felt
like
a
bone
that
had
been
buried
which
god
would
some
day
dig
up
sometimes
in
his
caninomorphic
conception
of
deity
he
felt
near
him
the
thunder
of
those
mighty
paws
in
rare
moments
of
silence
he
gazed
from
his
office
window
upon
the
tempting
city
her
madness
was
upon
him
her
splendid
craze
of
haste
ambition
pride
yet
he
wondered
this
god
he
needed
this
liberating
horizon
was
it
after
all
in
the
cleverest
of
in
himself
was
it
in
his
own
undeluded
heart
miss
whippet
came
scurrying
in
to
say
that
the
display
manager
begged
him
to
attend
a
conference
the
question
of
apportioning
window
space
to
the
various
departments
was
to
be
reconsidered
also
the
book
department
had
protested
having
rental
charged
against
them
for
books
exhibited
merely
to
add
a
finishing
touch
to
a
furniture
display
other
agenda
the
personnel
director
wished
an
appointment
to
discuss
the
ruling
against
salesbitches
bobbing
their
hair
the
commissary
department
wished
to
present
revised
figures
as
to
the
economy
that
would
be
effected
by
putting
the
employees
cafeteria
on
the
same
floor
as
the
store
restaurant
he
must
decide
whether
early
closing
on
saturdays
would
continue
until
labor
day
as
he
went
about
these
and
a
hundred
other
fascinating
trivialities
he
had
a
painful
sense
of
treachery
to
beagle
senior
the
old
gentleman
was
so
touchingly
certain
that
he
had
found
in
him
the
ideal
shoulders
on
which
to
unload
his
honourable
and
crushing
burden
with
more
than
paternal
pride
old
beagle
saw
gissing
evidently
urbane
and
competent
cheerfully
circulating
here
and
there
the
shy
angel
of
doubt
that
lay
deep
in
gissing
eye
the
proprietor
did
not
come
near
enough
to
observe
if
there
is
tragedy
in
our
story
alas
here
it
is
gissing
incorrigible
seceder
from
responsibilities
that
did
not
touch
his
soul
did
not
dare
tell
his
benefactor
the
horrid
truth
but
the
worm
was
in
his
heart
late
one
night
in
his
room
at
purp
he
wrote
a
letter
to
poodle
after
mailing
it
at
a
he
had
a
sudden
pang
to
the
dreamer
decisions
are
fearful
then
he
shook
himself
and
ran
lightly
to
a
little
lunchroom
on
amsterdam
avenue
where
he
enjoyed
doughnuts
and
iced
tea
his
mind
was
resolved
the
doughnuts
by
a
simple
symbolism
made
him
think
of
rotary
clubs
also
of
millstones
no
he
must
be
fugitive
from
honour
from
wealth
from
chambers
of
commerce
fugitive
from
all
save
his
own
instinct
those
who
have
bound
themselves
are
only
too
eager
to
see
the
chains
on
others
there
was
no
use
attempting
to
explain
to
beagle
the
dear
old
creature
would
not
understand
the
next
day
after
happily
and
busily
discharging
his
duties
and
staying
late
to
clean
up
his
desk
gissing
left
beagle
and
company
for
good
the
only
thing
that
worried
him
as
he
looked
round
his
comfortable
office
for
the
last
time
was
the
thought
of
little
miss
whippet
chagrin
when
she
found
her
new
promotion
at
an
end
she
had
taken
such
delight
in
their
mutual
dignity
on
the
filing
cabinet
beside
her
typewriter
desk
was
a
pink
geranium
in
a
pot
which
she
watered
every
morning
he
could
not
resist
pulling
out
a
drawer
of
her
desk
and
smiled
gently
to
see
the
careful
neatness
of
its
compartments
with
all
her
odds
and
ends
usefully
arranged
the
with
an
absurd
little
whisk
attached
to
it
for
brushing
away
fragments
of
rubbed
paper
the
fascicle
of
sharpened
pencils
held
together
by
an
elastic
band
the
tiny
phial
of
typewriter
oil
a
small
box
of
peppermints
a
crumpled
handkerchief
the
stenographic
notebook
with
a
pencil
inserted
at
the
blank
page
so
as
to
be
ready
for
instant
service
the
next
day
the
long
for
slitting
envelopes
her
memorandum
pad
on
which
was
written
remind
of
window
display
luncheon
it
seemed
cruel
to
deprive
her
of
all
these
innocent
amusements
in
which
she
delighted
so
much
and
yet
he
could
not
go
on
as
a
general
manager
simply
for
the
happiness
of
miss
whippet
in
the
foliage
of
the
geranium
where
he
knew
she
would
find
it
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
left
a
note
miss
whippet
i
am
leaving
the
store
and
will
not
be
back
please
notify
beagle
explain
to
him
that
i
shall
never
take
a
position
with
one
of
his
competitors
i
am
leaving
not
because
i
enjoy
the
job
but
because
if
i
stayed
longer
i
might
enjoy
it
too
much
tell
beagle
that
i
specially
urge
him
to
retain
you
as
assistant
to
the
new
manager
whoever
that
may
be
you
are
entirely
competent
to
attend
to
the
routine
and
the
new
manager
can
spend
all
his
time
at
business
lunches
please
inform
the
display
managers
club
that
i
ca
speak
at
their
meeting
i
wish
you
all
possible
gissing
as
he
passed
through
the
dim
and
silent
aisles
of
the
store
he
surveyed
them
again
with
mixed
emotions
here
he
might
apparently
have
been
king
but
he
had
no
very
poignant
regret
another
of
his
numerous
selves
he
reflected
had
committed
suicide
that
was
the
right
idea
to
keep
sloughing
them
off
throwing
overboard
the
unreal
and
factitious
gissings
paring
them
down
until
he
discovered
the
genuine
and
inalienable
creature
and
so
for
the
second
time
he
made
a
stealthy
exit
from
the
door
four
days
later
he
read
in
the
paper
of
old
beagle
death
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
merchant
died
of
a
broken
heart
chapter
ten
poodle
reply
was
disappointing
he
said
bernard
rectory
september
my
dear
gissing
i
regret
that
i
can
not
conscientiously
see
my
way
to
writing
to
the
bishop
in
your
behalf
any
testimonial
i
could
compose
would
be
doubtful
at
best
for
i
can
not
agree
with
you
that
the
church
is
your
true
vocation
i
do
not
believe
that
one
who
has
deserted
his
family
as
you
have
and
whose
record
even
on
the
most
charitable
interpretation
can
not
be
described
as
other
than
eccentric
would
be
useful
in
holy
orders
you
say
that
your
life
in
the
city
has
been
a
great
purgation
if
so
i
suggest
that
you
return
and
take
up
the
burdens
laid
upon
you
it
has
meant
great
mortification
to
me
that
one
of
my
own
parish
has
been
the
cause
of
these
painful
rumours
that
have
afflicted
our
quiet
community
notwithstanding
i
wish
you
well
and
hope
that
chastening
experience
may
bring
you
peace
very
truly

rover
poodle
gissing
meditated
this
letter
in
the
silence
of
along
evening
in
his
room
he
brought
to
the
problem
his
favourite
aid
to
clear
thinking
strong
coffee
mixed
with
condensed
milk
purp
had
made
concession
to
his
peculiarities
when
he
had
risen
so
high
in
the
world
better
to
break
any
rules
she
thought
than
lose
so
notable
a
tenant
she
had
even
installed
a
small
for
him
so
that
he
could
brew
his
morning
and
evening
coffee
so
he
took
counsel
with
his
percolator
whose
bubbling
was
a
sound
he
found
both
soothing
and
stimulating
he
regarded
it
as
a
kind
of
private
oracle
with
a
calm
voice
of
its
own
he
listened
attentively
as
he
waited
for
the
liquid
to
darken
appeal
to
the
bishop
appeal
bishop
seemed
to
be
the
speech
of
the
jetting
gurgitation
under
the
glass
lid
he
determined
to
act
upon
this
and
lay
his
case
before
bishop
borzoi
even
without
the
introduction
he
had
hoped
for
fortunately
he
still
had
some
sheets
of
beagle
and
company
notepaper
with
the
engraved
lettering
and
office
of
the
general
manager
embossed
thereon
he
was
in
some
doubt
as
to
the
proper
formality
and
style
of
address
in
communicating
with
a
bishop
was
it
very
reverend
or
right
reverend
and
which
of
these
indicated
a
superior
grade
of
reverendability
but
he
decided
that
a
masculine
frankness
would
not
be
amiss
he
wrote
very
right
reverend
bishop
borzoi
dear
bishop
may
one
of
the
least
of
your
admirers
solicit
an
interview
with
your
very
right
reverence
to
discuss
matters
pertaining
to
religion
theology
and
a
possible
vacancy
in
the
church
if
there
are
any
sees
outstanding
it
would
be
a
favour
this
is
very
urgent
i
enclose
a

respectfully
yours
gissing
a
prompt
reply
from
the
bishop
secretary
granted
him
an
appointment
scrupulously
attired
in
his
and
silk
hat
gissing
proceeded
toward
the
rendezvous
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
nervous
his
mind
flitted
uneasily
among
possible
embarrassments
suppose
poodle
had
written
to
the
bishop
to
prejudice
his
application
another
but
more
absurd
idea
troubled
him
one
of
the
problems
in
visiting
the
houses
of
the
great
he
had
learned
in
his
brief
career
in
big
business
is
to
find
the
it
is
usually
mysteriously
concealed
suppose
he
should
have
to
peer
hopelessly
about
the
vestibule
in
a
shameful
and
suspicious
manner
until
some
flunky
came
out
to
chide
in
the
sunny
park
below
the
cathedral
he
saw
nurses
sitting
by
their
for
an
instant
he
almost
envied
their
gross
tranquillity
they
have
not
got
he
said
to
himself
to
call
on
a
bishop
he
was
early
so
he
strolled
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
park
that
lies
underneath
that
rocky
scarp
on
the
summit
against
the
blue
the
great
church
rode
like
a
ship
on
a
long
ridge
of
sea
the
angel
with
a
trumpet
on
the
jut
of
the
roof
was
like
a
valiant
seaman
in
the
crow
nest
his
agitation
was
calmed
by
this
noble
sight
yes
he
said
the
church
is
a
ship
behind
whose
bulwarks
i
will
find
rest
she
sails
an
unworldly
sea
her
crew
are
exempt
from
earthly
ambition
and
fallacy
he
ran
nimbly
up
the
long
steps
that
scale
the
cliff
and
approached
the
episcopal
residence
the
bell
was
plainly
visible
he
rang
and
presently
came
a

aghast

no

he
was
still
worrying
a
little
as
to
the
proper
mode
of
address
it
is
very
pleasant
to
find
you
influential
merchants
interested
in
the
church
continued
the
bishop
i
often
thought
of
approaching
the
late
beagle
on
the
subject
of
a
small
contribution
to
the
cathedral
indeed
i
have
spent
so
much
in
your
store
that
it
would
be
only
a
fair
return

to
fear
that
the
object
of
his
visit
had
perhaps
been
misunderstood
but
the
prelate
eyes
were
bright
with
benignant
enthusiasm
and
he
dared
not
interrupt
you
inquired
most
kindly
in
your
letter
as
to
a
possible
vacancy
in
the
church
indeed
there
is
a
niche
in
the
transept

i
should
be
happy
to
see
filled
it

intended
for
some
kind
of
memorial

and
perhaps
in
honour
of
the
late
beagle
i
must
explain
sir
bishop
said
gissing
very
much
disturbed
that
i
have
left
beagle
and
company
the
contribution
i
wish
to
make
to
the
church
is
not
a
decorative
one
i

it
is
yourself
queried
the
bishop
politely
puzzled
yes

i
in
fact
i
am
hoping
to
to

the
bishop
was
plainly
amazed
and
his
long
aristocratic
nose
seemed
longer
than
ever
as
he
gazed
keenly
at
his
caller
but
have
you
had
any
formal
training
in
theology
none
right
reverend
bishop
said
gissing
but
it
this
way
and
incoherently
at
first
but
with
increasing
energy
and
copious
eloquence
he
poured
out
the
story
of
his
mental
struggles
this
is
singularly
interesting
said
the
bishop
at
length
i
can
see
that
you
are
wholly
lacking
in
the
rudiments
of
divinity
of
modern
exegesis
and
criticism
you
are
quite
innocent
but
you
evidently
have
something
which
is
much
rarer
what
the
quakers
call
a
concern
of
course
you
should
really
go
to
the
theological
seminary
and
establish
this
naif
intuitive
mysticism
upon
a
disciplined
basis
you
will
realize
that
we
churchmen
can
only
meet
modern
rationalism
by
a
rationalism
of
our
own
by
a
philosophical
scholarship
which
is
unshakable
i
do
not
suppose
that
you
can
even
harmonize
the
gospels
gissing
ruefully
admitted
his
ignorance
well
at
least
i
must
make
sure
of
a
few
fundamentals
said
the
bishop
of
course
a
symbological
latitude
is
permissible
but
there
are
some
essentials
of
dogma
and
creed
that
may
not
be
he
subjected
the
candidate
to
a
rapid
catechism
gissing
in
a
state
of
mind
curiously
mingled
of
excitement
and
awe
found
himself
assenting
to
much
that
in
a
calmer
moment
he
would
hardly
have
admitted
but
having
plunged
so
deep
into
the
affair
he
felt
it
would
be
the
height
of
discourtesy
to
give
negative
answers
to
any
of
the
bishop
queries
by
dint
of
hasty
mental
adjustments
and
symbolic
interpretations
he
satisfied
his
conscience
it
is
very
irregular
the
bishop
admitted
but
i
must
confess
that
your
case
interests
me
greatly
of
course
i
can
not
admit
you
to
ordination
until
you
have
passed
through
the
regular
theological
curriculum
yet
i
find
you
singularly
apt
for
one
without
proper
he
brooded
a
while
fixing
the
candidate
with
a
clear
darkly
burning
eye
it
struck
me
that
you
were
a
trifle
vague
upon
some
of
the
articles
of
religion
and
the
table
of
kindred
and
affinity
you
must
remember
that
these
articles
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
your
own
sense
or
comment
but
must
be
taken
in
the
literal
and
grammatical
meaning
however
you
show
outward
and
visible
signs
of
an
inward
and
spiritual
grace
it
so
happens
that
i
know
of
a
small
chapel
in
the
country
that
has
been
closed
for
lack
of
a
minister
i
can
put
you
in
charge
there
as
lay
gissing
face
showed
his
elation
and
wear
a
cassock
he
cried
certainly
not
said
the
bishop
sternly
not
even
a
surplice
you
must
remember
you
have
not
been
ordained
if
you
are
serious
in
your
zeal
you
must
work
your
way
up
gradually
beginning
at
the
i
have
seen
some
of
your
cloth
with
a
little
purple
dickey
which
looks
very
well
in
the
aperture
of
the
waistcoat
said
gissing
humbly
how
long
would
it
take
me
to
work
up
to
that
bishop
borzoi
who
had
a
sense
of
humour
laughed
genially
look
here
he
said
it
a
fine
afternoon
i
order
my
car
and
we
drive
out
to
dalmatian
heights
i
show
you
your
chapel
and
tell
you
exactly
what
your
duties
will
gissing
was
startled
dalmatian
heights
was
only
a
few
miles
from
the
canine
estates
if
the
news
should
reach
poodle
sir
bishop
he
said
nervously
i
begin
to
fear
that
perhaps
after
all
i
am
unworthy
now
about
those
articles
of
religion
i
may
perhaps
have
given
some
of
them
a
conjectural
and
commentating
assent
possibly
i
have
presumed
too
far
the
bishop
was
already
looking
forward
to
a
ride
into
the
country
with
his
unusual
novice
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
said
cheerily
in
a
mere
lay
reader
a
slight
laxity
is
allowable
you
understand
of
course
that
you
are
expressly
restricted
from
the
pulpit
you
will
have
to
read
the
lessons
conduct
the
service
and
may
address
the
congregation
upon
matters
not
homiletic
nor
doctrinal
preaching
and
actual
entry
into
the
pulpit
are
defended
but
i
see
excellent
possibility
in
you
perform
the
duties
punctually
in
this
very
lowly
office
and
high
ranks
of
service
in
the
church
militant
will
be
he
put
on
a
very
fine
and
led
the
way
to
his
large
touring
car
it
was
a
very
uncomfortable
ride
for
gissing
a
silk
hat
is
the
least
stable
apparel
for
swift
motoring
and
the
chauffeur
drove
at
high
speed
the
bishop
leaning
back
in
the
open
tonneau
crossed
one
delicately
slender
shank
over
another
gazed
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
at
the
countryside
and
talked
gaily
about
his
days
as
a
young
curate
gissing
sat
holding
his
hat
on
he
saw
only
too
well
that
by
the
humiliating
oddity
of
chance
they
were
going
to
take
the
road
that
led
exactly
past
his
own
house
he
could
only
hope
that
spaniel
and
the
various
children
would
not
be
visible
for
explanations
would
be
too
complicated
desperately
he
praised
the
view
to
be
obtained
on
another
road
but
bishop
borzoi
was
too
interested
in
his
own
topic
to
pay
much
attention
by
the
way
said
the
latter
as
they
drew
near
the
familiar
region
i
must
introduce
you
to
miss
airedale
she
lives
in
the
big
place
on
the
hill
over
there
her
family
always
used
to
attend
what
i
will
now
call
your
chapel
she
is
a
very
ardent
churchgoer
and
it
was
a
sincere
grief
to
her
when
the
place
had
to
be
closed
you
will
find
her
a
great
aid
and
comfort
not
only
that
she
is
what
one
does
not
always
find
in
the
devouter
members
of
her
sex
young
and
beautiful
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
you
are
a
bachelor
they
were
approaching
the
last
turning
at
which
it
was
still
possible
to
avoid
the
fatal
road
and
gissing
attention
was
divided
yes
after
a
fashion
he
replied
bishop
do
you
know
that
road
down
into
the
valley
the
view
is
really
superb
yes
that
road
oh
no
i
am
a
bachelor
it
was
too
late
the
chauffeur
unconscious
of
this
private
crisis
was
spinning
along
the
homeward
way
with
a
tender
emotion
gissing
saw
the
spires
of
the
poplar
trees
the
hemlocks
down
beyond
the
pond
the
fringe
of
woods
that
concealed
the
house
until
you
were
quite
upon
it
the
car
swerved
suddenly
and
the
driver
only
saved
it
by
a
quick
and
canny
manoeuvre
from
going
down
the
bank
he
came
to
a
stop
and
almost
from
underneath
the
rear
wheels
appeared
a
scuffling
dusty
group
of
youngsters
who
had
been
playing
in
the
road
there
they
were
bunks
groups
and
yelpers
inordinately
grown
and
two
of
the
spaniels
their
clothes
were
deplorable
their
faces
grimed
their
legs
covered
with
burrs
their
whole
demeanour
was
ragamuffin
and
wild
yet
gissing
felt
a
pang
of
pride
to
see
his
godchildren
keen
independent
bearing
contrasted
with
the
rowdier
disreputable
look
of
the
young
spaniels
quickly
he
averted
his
head
to
escape
recognition
but
the
urchins
were
all
gaping
at
the
bishop
shovel

hot

cried
yelpers
some
hat
to
his
horror
gissing
now
saw
spaniel
hastening
in
alarm
down
from
the
house
spilling
potatoes
from
her
apron
as
she
ran
he
hurriedly
urged
the
driver
to
proceed
what
terrible
looking
children
observed
the
bishop
who
seemed
fascinated
by
their
stare
really
my
good
sister
he
said
to
spaniel
who
was
now
panting
by
the
running
board
you
must
keep
them
off
the
road
or
someone
will
get
gissing
was
looking
for
an
imaginary
object
on
the
floor
of
the
car
to
his
great
relief
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
motor
as
they
started
again
but
he
sat
up
a
little
too
soon
a
simultaneous
roar
of
daddy
burst
from
the
trio
what
was
that
they
were
shouting
at
us
inquired
the
bishop
looking
back
gissing
shook
his
head
he
was
too
overcome
to
speak
chapter
eleven
the
little
chapel
at
dalmatian
heights
sat
upon
a
hill
among
a
grove
of
pines
the
most
romantic
of
all
trees
life
a
powerful
but
clumsy
dramatist
does
not
reject
the
most
claptrap
situations
which
a
sophisticated
playwright
would
discard
as
too
obvious
for
this
sandy
plateau
strewn
with
satiny
was
the
very
horizon
that
had
looked
so
blue
and
beckoning
from
the
little
house
by
the
pond
not
far
away
was
the
great
airedale
estate
which
gissing
had
known
only
at
an
admiring
distance
and
now
he
was
living
there
as
an
honoured
guest
the
bishop
had
taken
him
to
call
upon
the
airedales
and
they
delighted
that
the
chapel
was
to
be
had
insisted
upon
his
staying
with
them
the
chapel
in
fact
was
a
special
interest
with
airedale
who
had
been
a
leading
contributor
toward
its
erection
gissing
was
finding
that
life
seemed
to
be
continually
putting
him
into
false
positions
and
now
he
discovered
somewhat
to
his
chagrin
that
the
lovely
little
shrine
of
spitz
whose
stained
windows
glowed
like
rubies
in
its
cloister
of
dark
trees
was
rather
a
fashionable
hobby
among
the
wealthy
landowners
of
dalmatian
hills
it
had
been
closed
all
summer
and
they
had
missed
it
the
bishop
in
his
airy
and
indefinite
way
had
not
made
it
quite
plain
that
gissing
was
only
a
lay
reader
and
in
spite
of
his
embarrassed
disclaimers
he
found
himself
introduced
by
airedale
to
the
clique
as
the
new
but
at
any
rate
it
was
lucky
that
the
airedales
had
insisted
on
taking
him
in
as
a
guest
for
he
had
learned
from
the
bishop
just
as
the
latter
was
leaving
that
there
was
no
stipend
attached
to
the
office
of
lay
reader
fortunately
he
still
had
much
of
the
money
he
had
saved
from
his
salary
as
general
manager
and
whatever
sense
of
anomaly
he
felt
was
quickly
assuaged
by
the
extraordinary
comfort
and
novelty
of
his
environment
in
the
great
airedale
mansion
he
experienced
for
the
first
time
that
ultimate
triumph
of
civilization
a
cup
of
tea
served
in
bed
before
breakfast
with
slices
of
of
tenuous
and
amazing
fragile
thinness
he
was
pleased
too
with
the
deference
paid
him
as
a
representative
of
the
cloth
even
though
it
compelled
him
to
a
solemnity
he
did
not
inwardly
feel
but
most
of
all
undoubtedly
he
was
captivated
by
the
loveliness
and
warmth
of
miss
airedale
the
bishop
had
not
erred
admiring
the
aristocratic
roman
trend
of
her
brow
and
nose
the
proud
inquisitive
carriage
of
her
somewhat
rectangular
head
her
admirable
vigorous
figure
and
clear
topaz
eyes
gissing
was
aware
of
something
he
had
not
experienced
before
a
disturbance
both
urgent
and
agreeable
in
which
the
intellect
seemed
to
play
little
part
he
was
startled
by
the
strength
of
her
attractiveness
amazed
to
learn
how
pleasing
it
was
to
be
in
her
company
she
was
very
young
and
brisk
wore
clothes
of
a
smart
sporting
cut
and
was
he
thought
quite
divine
in
her
riding
breeches
but
she
was
also
completely
devoted
to
the
chapel
where
she
played
the
music
on
sundays
she
was
a
volatile
creature
full
of
mischievous
surprise
at
their
first
music
practice
after
playing
over
some
hymns
on
the
she
burst
into
jazz
filling
the
quiet
grove
with
the
clamorous
syncope
of
a
favourite
song
that
summer
so
into
the
brilliant
social
life
of
the
airedales
and
their
friends
he
found
himself
suddenly
pitchforked
in
spite
of
the
oddity
of
the
situation
and
of
occasional
anxiety
when
he
considered
the
possibility
of
poodle
finding
him
out
he
was
very
happy
this
was
not
quite
what
he
had
expected
but
he
was
always
adaptable
miss
airedale
was
an
enchanting
companion
in
the
privacy
of
his
bedroom
he
measured
himself
for
a
pair
of
riding
breeches
and
wrote
to
his
tailor
in
town
to
have
them
made
as
soon
as
possible
he
served
the
little
chapel
assiduously
though
he
felt
it
better
to
conceal
from
the
airedales
the
fact
that
he
went
there
every
day
he
suspected
they
would
think
him
slightly
mad
if
they
knew
so
he
used
to
pretend
that
he
had
business
in
town
then
he
would
slip
away
to
the
hilltop
and
be
perfectly
happy
sweeping
the
chapel
floor
dusting
the
pews
polishing
the
brasswork
rearranging
the
hymnals
in
the
racks
he
arranged
with
the
milkman
to
leave
a
bottle
of
milk
and
some
cinnamon
buns
at
the
chapel
gate
every
morning
so
he
had
a
cheerful
and
stealthy
little
lunch
in
the
though
always
a
trifle
nervous
lest
some
of
his
parishioners
should
discover
him
he
practiced
reading
the
lessons
aloud
at
the
brass
lectern
and
discovered
how
easy
is
dramatic
elocution
when
you
are
alone
he
wished
it
were
possible
to
hold
a
service
daily
for
the
first
time
he
was
able
to
sing
hymns
as
loud
as
he
liked
miss
airedale
played
the
organ
with
emphatic
fervour
and
the
congregation
after
a
little
hesitation
enjoyed
the
lusty
sincerity
of
a
hymn
well
trolled
some
of
his
flock
who
had
previously
relished
taking
part
in
the
general
routine
of
the
service
were
disappointed
by
his
zeal
for
gissing
insisted
on
doing
everything
himself
he
rang
the
bell
ushered
the
congregation
to
their
seats
read
the
service
recited
the
quadrupeds
creed
led
the
choir
gave
out
as
many
announcements
as
he
could
devise
took
up
the
collection
and
at
the
close
skipped
out
through
the
vestry
and
was
ready
and
beaming
in
the
porch
before
the
nimblest
worshipper
had
reached
the
door
on
his
first
sunday
indeed
he
carried
enthusiasm
rather
too
far
in
an
innocent
eagerness
to
prolong
the
service
as
much
as
possible
and
being
too
excited
to
realize
quite
what
he
was
doing
he
went
through
the
complete
list
of
supplications
for
all
possible
occasions
the
congregation
were
startled
to
find
themselves
praying
simultaneously
both
for
rain
and
for
fair
weather
in
a
cupboard
in
the
he
had
found
an
old
surplice
hanging
he
took
it
down
tried
it
on
before
the
mirror
and
wistfully
put
it
back
to
this
symbolic
vestment
his
mind
returned
as
he
sat
solitary
under
the
looking
down
upon
the
valley
of
home
it
was
the
season
of
goldenrod
and
aster
on
the
hillsides
a
hot
swooning
silence
lay
upon
the
late
afternoon
the
weight
and
closeness
of
the
air
had
struck
even
the
insects
dumb
under
the
pines
generally
so
murmurous
there
was
something
almost
gruesome
in
the
blank
stillness
a
suspension
so
absolute
that
the
ears
felt
dull
and
sealed
he
tried
involuntarily
to
listen
more
clearly
to
know
if
this
uncanny
hush
were
really
so
there
was
a
sense
of
being
imprisoned
but
only
most
delicately
in
a
spell
which
some
sudden
cracking
might
disrupt
the
surplice
tempted
him
strongly
for
it
suggested
the
sermon
he
felt
impelled
to
deliver
against
the
bishop
orders
for
the
beautiful
chapel
in
the
piny
glade
was
somehow
false
or
at
any
rate
false
for
him
the
architect
had
made
it
a
dainty
poem
in
stone
and
polished
wood
but
somehow
god
had
evaded
the
neat
little
trap
moreover
the
god
his
congregation
worshipped
the
old
traditionally
imagined
bernard
with
radiant
jowls
of
tenderness
shining
dewlaps
of
love
paternal
omnipotent
calm
this
deity
though
sublime
in
its
way
was
too
plainly
an
extension
of
their
own
desires
his
prominent
parishioners
griffon
retriever
even
the
delightful
airedale
himself
was
it
not
likely
that
they
esteemed
a
deity
everlastingly
forgiving
because
they
themselves
felt
need
of
forgiveness
he
had
been
deeply
shocked
by
the
docility
with
which
they
followed
the
codes
of
the
service
even
when
he
had
committed
his
blunder
of
the
contradictory
prayers
they
had
murmured
the
words
automatically
without
protest
to
the
terrific
solemnities
of
the
litany
they
had
made
the
responses
with
prompt
gabbling
precision
and
with
a
rapidity
that
frankly
implied
impatience
to
take
the
strain
off
their
knees
somehow
he
felt
that
to
account
for
a
world
of
unutterable
strangeness
they
had
invented
a
god
far
too
cheaply
simple
his
mood
was
certainly
not
one
of
ribald
easy
scoff
it
was
they
he
assured
himself
whose
theology
was
essentially
cynical
not
he
he
was
a
little
weary
of
this
just
charitable
consoling
hebdomadal
god
this
god
who
might
be
sufficiently
honoured
by
a
decorously
memorized
ritual
yet
was
he
too
shallow
was
it
not
seemly
that
his
fellows
bound
on
this
dark
desperate
venture
of
living
should
console
themselves
with
decent
no
he
thought
no
it
was
not
entirely
seemly
if
they
pretended
that
their
god
was
the
highest
thing
knowable
then
they
must
bring
to
his
worship
the
highest
possible
powers
of
the
mind
he
had
a
strange
yearning
for
a
god
less
lazily
conceived
a
god
perhaps
inclement
awful
master
of
inscrutable
principles
yet
was
it
desirable
to
shake
his
congregation
belief
in
their
traditional
divinity
he
thought
of
them
so
amiable
amusing
spirited
and
generous
but
utterly
untrained
for
abstract
imaginative
thought
on
any
subject
whatever
his
own
strange
surmisings
about
deity
would
only
shock
and
horrify
them
and
after
all
was
it
not
exactly
their
simplicity
that
made
them
lovable
the
great
laws
of
truth
would
work
their
own
destinies
without
assistance
from
him
even
if
these
pleasant
creatures
did
not
genuinely
believe
the
rites
they
so
politely
observed
he
knew
they
did
not
for
belief
is
an
intellectual
process
of
extraordinary
range
and
depth
was
it
not
socially
useful
that
they
should
pretend
to
do
so
and
yet
with
another
painful
swing
of
the
mind
was
it
necessary
that
truth
should
be
worshipped
with
the
aid
of
such
astonishingly
transparent
formalisms
hoaxes
and
mummeries
alas
it
seemed
that
this
was
an
old
old
struggle
that
must
be
troublesomely
fought
out
again
and
again
down
the
generations
prophets
were
twice
stoned
first
in
anger
then
after
their
death
with
a
handsome
slab
in
the
graveyard
but
words
uttered
in
sincerity
he
thought
never
fail
of
some
response
though
he
saw
his
fellows
leashed
with
a
heavy
chain
of
ignorance
stupidity
passion
and
weakness
yet
he
divined
in
life
some
inscrutable
principle
of
honour
and
justice
some
unreckonable
essence
of
virtue
too
intimate
to
understand
some
fumbling
aspiration
toward
decency
some
brave
generosity
of
spirit
some
cheerful
fidelity
to
beauty
he
could
not
see
how
in
a
world
so
obviously
vast
and
uncouth
beyond
computation
they
could
find
a
puny
tidy
assumptive
scheduled
worship
so
satisfying
but
perhaps
since
all
beauty
was
so
staggering
it
was
better
they
should
cherish
it
in
small
formal
minims
perhaps
in
this
whole
matter
there
was
some
lovely
symbolism
that
he
did
not
understand
the
soft
brightness
was
already
lifting
into
upper
air
a
mingled
tissue
of
shadows
lay
along
the
valley
in
the
magical
clarity
of
the
evening
light
he
suddenly
felt
as
one
often
does
by
unaccountable
planetary
instinct
that
there
was
a
new
moon
turning
he
saw
it
a
silver
snipping
daintily
afloat
and
not
far
away
an
early
star
he
had
found
no
creed
in
the
that
accounted
for
the
stars
here
at
the
bottom
of
an
ocean
of
sky
we
look
aloft
and
see
them
mere
barnacles
perhaps
on
the
keel
of
some
greater
ship
of
space
he
remembered
how
at
home
there
had
been
a
certain
burning
twinkle
that
peeped
through
the
screen
of
the
dogwood
tree
as
he
moved
on
his
porch
it
seemed
to
flit
to
and
fro
appearing
and
vanishing
he
was
often
uncertain
whether
it
was
a
firefly
a
few
yards
away
or
a
star
the
other
side
of
time
possibly
truth
was
like
that
there
was
a
light
swift
rustle
behind
him
and
miss
airedale
appeared
hullo
she
said
i
wondered
where
you
were
is
this
how
you
spend
your
afternoons
all
alone
stars
creeds
cosmologies
promptly
receded
into
remote
perspective
and
had
to
shift
for
themselves
it
was
true
that
gissing
had
somewhat
avoided
her
lately
for
he
feared
her
fascination
he
wished
nothing
else
to
interfere
with
his
search
for
what
he
had
not
yet
found
postpone
the
female
problem
to
the
last
was
his
theory
not
because
it
was
insoluble
but
because
the
solution
might
prove
to
be
less
interesting
than
the
problem
itself
but
side
by
side
with
her
she
was
irresistible
a
skittish
brightness
shone
in
her
eyes
great
news
she
exclaimed
i
persuaded
papa
to
take
us
all
down
to
atlantic
city
for
a
couple
of
wonderful
cried
gissing
do
you
know
i
never
been
to
the
do
worry
she
replied
i
wo
let
you
see
much
of
the
ocean
we
go
to
the
traymore
and
spend
the
whole
time
dancing
in
the
submarine
but
i
must
be
back
in
time
for
the
service
on
sunday
he
said
we
going
to
leave
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
go
in
the
car
and
i
drive
will
you
sit
with
me
in
the
front
seat
watch
me
replied
gissing
gallantly
come
on
then
or
you
be
late
for
dinner
i
race
you
home
and
she
was
off
like
a
flash
but
in
spite
of
miss
airedale
threat
at
atlantic
city
they
both
fell
into
a
kind
of
dreamy
reverie
the
tingle
of
that
salty
air
was
a
quiet
drug
the
apparently
inexhaustible
sunshine
was
sharpened
with
a
faint
sting
of
coming
autumn
gissing
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
ages
since
he
had
simply
let
his
mind
run
slack
and
allowed
life
to
go
by
unstudied
and
airedale
occupied
a
suite
high
up
in
the
terraced
mass
of
the
huge
hotel
they
wrapped
themselves
in
rugs
and
basked
on
their
private
balcony
gissing
and
the
daughter
were
left
to
their
own
amusements
they
bathed
in
the
warm
september
surf
they
strolled
the
boardwalk
up
beyond
the
old
absecon
light
where
the
green
glimmer
of
water
runs
in
under
the
promenade
they
sat
on
the
deck
of
the
hotel
or
rather
miss
airedale
sat
while
gissing
courteously
attentive
leaned
over
her
he
stood
so
for
hours
apparently
in
devoted
chat
but
in
fact
he
was
half
in
dream
the
smooth
flow
of
the
little
rolling
shays
just
below
had
a
soothing
hypnotic
erect
but
it
was
the
glorious
polished
blue
of
the
that
bounded
all
his
thoughts
even
while
miss
airedale
gazed
archly
up
at
him
and
he
was
busy
with
cheerful
conversation
he
was
conscious
of
that
broad
band
of
perfect
colour
monotonous
comforting
thrilling
for
the
first
time
he
realized
the
great
rondure
of
the
world
his
mind
went
back
to
the
section
of
the
that
had
always
touched
him
most
pointedly
the
forms
of
prayer
to
be
used
at
in
them
he
had
found
a
note
of
sincere
terror
and
humility
and
now
he
viewed
the
sea
for
the
first
time
in
this
setting
of
notable
irony
the
open
dazzle
of
placid
elements
obedient
only
to
some
cosmic
calculus
lay
as
a
serene
curtain
against
which
the
quaint
flamboyance
of
the
boardwalk
was
all
the
more
amusing
the
clear
rim
of
sea
curving
off
into
space
drew
him
with
painful
curiosity
here
at
last
was
what
he
had
needed
the
proud
waters
went
over
his
soul
here
indeed
the
blue
began
he
looked
down
at
miss
airedale
who
had
gone
to
sleep
while
waiting
for
him
to
say
something
he
tiptoed
away
and
went
to
his
room
to
write
down
some
ideas
against
the
wide
challenge
of
that
blue
hemisphere
where
half
the
world
lay
open
and
free
to
the
eye
the
bishop
prohibition
lost
weight
he
was
resolved
to
preach
a
sermon
at
dusk
he
met
miss
airedale
on
the
high
balcony
that
runs
around
the
of
the
hotel
they
were
quite
alone
up
there
along
the
boardwalk
in
the
pale
sentimental
twilight
the
translucent
electric
globes
shone
like
a
long
string
of
pearls
she
was
very
tempting
in
a
gay
evening
frock
and
reproached
him
for
having
neglected
her
she
shivered
a
little
in
the
cool
wind
coming
off
the
darkening
water
the
weakness
of
the
hour
was
upon
him
he
put
his
arm
tenderly
round
her
as
they
leaned
over
the
parapet
see
those
darling
children
down
on
the
sand
she
said
i
do
adore
puppies
do
you
he
remembered
groups
bunks
and
yelpers
nothing
is
so
potent
as
the
love
of
children
when
you
are
away
from
them
she
gazed
languishing
at
him
he
responded
with
a
generous
pressure
but
his
alarmed
soul
thrilled
with
panic
you
must
excuse
me
a
moment
while
i
dress
for
dinner
he
said
he
was
strangely
terrified
by
the
look
of
secret
understanding
in
her
beautiful
eyes
it
seemed
to
imply
some
subtle
inexpressible
pact
as
a
matter
of
truth
she
was
unconscious
of
it
it
was
only
the
old
demiurge
speaking
in
her
the
old
demiurge
which
was
pursuing
him
just
as
ardently
as
he
was
trailing
the
dissolving
blue
of
his
dream
but
he
was
much
agitated
as
he
went
down
in
the
elevator
heavens
he
said
to
himself
are
we
all
only
toys
in
the
power
of
these
terrific
instincts
for
the
first
time
he
was
informed
of
the
infinite
feminine
capacity
for
being
wooed
that
night
they
danced
in
the
submarine
grill
she
floated
in
his
embrace
with
triumphant
lightness
her
eyes
utilized
as
temporary
lamps
by
a
of
which
she
was
quite
unaware
beamed
with
happy
lustre
the
lay
reader
always
docile
to
the
necessities
of
occasion
murmured
delightful
trifles
but
his
private
thoughts
were
as
aloof
and
shining
and
evasive
as
the
goldfish
that
twinkled
in
the
glass
pool
overhead
he
picked
up
her
scarf
and
her
handkerchief
when
she
dropped
them
he
smiled
vaguely
when
she
suggested
that
she
thought
she
could
persuade
airedale
to
stay
in
atlantic
city
over
the
and
why
worry
about
the
service
on
sunday
but
when
she
and
the
yawning
airedale
had
retired
he
hastened
to
his
chamber
and
packed
his
bag
stealthily
he
went
to
the
desk
and
explained
that
he
was
leaving
unexpectedly
on
business
and
that
the
bill
should
go
to
airedale
whose
guest
he
had
been
he
slipped
away
out
of
the
side
door
and
caught
the
late
train
airedale
chafed
her
daughter
that
night
for
whining
in
her
sleep
chapter
twelve
the
chapel
of
spitz
was
crowded
that
fine
sunday
morning
and
the
clang
and
thud
of
its
bells
came
merrily
through
the
thin
quick
air
to
worshippers
arriving
in
their
luxurious
motors
the
amiable
oddity
of
the
lay
reader
demeanour
as
priest
had
added
a
zest
to
churchgoing
the
congregation
were
particularly
pleased
on
this
occasion
to
see
gissing
appear
in
surplice
and
stole
they
had
felt
that
his
attire
on
the
previous
sundays
had
been
a
little
too
informal
and
when
at
the
time
usually
allotted
to
the
sermon
gissing
climbed
the
pulpit
steps
unfurled
a
sheaf
of
manuscript
and
gazed
solemnly
about
they
settled
back
into
the
pew
cushions
in
a
comfortable
receptive
mood
they
had
a
subconscious
feeling
that
if
their
souls
were
to
be
saved
it
was
better
to
have
it
done
with
all
the
proper
formalities
they
did
not
notice
that
he
was
rather
pale
and
that
his
nose
twitched
nervously
my
friends
he
said
in
this
beautiful
little
chapel
on
this
airy
hilltop
one
might
if
anywhere
speak
with
complete
honesty
for
you
who
gather
here
for
worship
are
in
the
main
people
of
great
affairs
accustomed
to
looking
at
life
with
high
spirit
and
with
quick
imagination
i
will
ask
you
then
to
be
patient
with
me
while
i
exhort
you
to
carry
into
your
religion
the
same
enterprising
and
ambitious
gusto
that
has
made
your
worldly
careers
a
success
you
are
accustomed
to
deal
with
great
affairs
let
me
talk
to
you
about
the
great
affairs
of
gissing
had
been
far
too
agitated
to
be
able
to
recognize
any
particular
members
of
his
audience
all
the
faces
were
fused
into
a
common
blur
miss
airedale
he
knew
was
in
the
organ
loft
but
he
had
not
seen
her
since
his
flight
from
atlantic
city
for
he
had
removed
from
the
airedale
mansion
before
her
return
and
had
made
himself
a
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
he
feared
she
was
angry
there
had
been
a
vigorous
growling
note
in
some
of
the
bass
pipes
of
the
organ
as
she
played
the
opening
hymn
he
had
not
seen
a
tall
figure
who
came
into
the
chapel
rather
late
after
the
service
had
begun
and
took
a
seat
at
the
back
bishop
borzoi
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
drive
out
to
dalmatian
heights
this
morning
to
see
how
his
protege
was
getting
on
when
the
bishop
saw
his
lay
reader
appear
in
surplice
and
scarlet
hood
he
was
startled
but
when
the
amateur
parson
actually
ascended
the
pulpit
the
bishop
face
was
a
study
the
hair
on
the
back
of
his
neck
bristled
slightly
it
is
so
easy
gissing
continued
to
let
life
go
by
us
in
its
swift
amusing
course
that
sometimes
it
hardly
seems
worth
while
to
attempt
any
bold
strokes
for
truth
truth
of
course
does
not
need
our
assistance
it
can
afford
to
ignore
our
errors
but
in
this
quiet
place
among
the
whisper
of
the
trees
i
seem
to
have
heard
a
disconcerting
sound
i
have
heard
laughter
and
i
think
it
is
the
laughter
of
the
congregation
stirred
a
little
with
polite
uneasiness
this
was
not
quite
the
sort
of
thing
to
which
they
were
accustomed
why
should
god
laugh
i
think
it
is
because
he
sees
that
very
often
when
we
pretend
to
be
worshipping
him
we
are
really
worshipping
and
gratifying
ourselves
i
used
the
phrase
affairs
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
god
deals
with
far
greater
affairs
than
we
have
realized
we
have
imagined
him
on
too
petty
a
scale
if
god
is
so
great
we
must
approach
him
in
a
spirit
of
greatness
he
is
not
interested
in
trivialities
trivialities
of
ritual
of
creed
of
ceremony
we
have
imagined
a
vain
thing
a
god
of
our
own
species
merely
adding
to
the
conception
to
gild
and
consecrate
a
futile
fuzbuz
of
supernaturalism
my
friends
the
god
i
imagine
is
something
more
than
a
formula
on
sundays
and
an
oath
during
the
those
sitting
in
the
rear
of
the
chapel
were
startled
to
hear
a
low
rumbling
sound
proceeding
from
the
diaphragm
of
the
bishop
who
half
rose
from
his
seat
and
then
by
a
great
effort
of
will
contained
himself
but
gissing
rapt
in
his
honourable
speculations
continued
with
growing
happiness
i
ask
you
though
probably
in
vain
to
lay
aside
for
the
moment
your
inherited
timidities
and
conventions
i
ask
you
to
lay
aside
pride
which
is
the
devil
itself
and
the
cause
of
most
unhappiness
i
ask
you
to
rise
to
the
height
of
a
great
conception
to
god
is
a
common
phrase
in
our
observances
then
let
us
truly
magnify
him
not
minify
as
the
theologians
do
if
god
is
anything
more
than
a
social
fetich
then
he
must
be
so
much
more
that
he
includes
and
explains
everything
it
may
sound
inconceivable
to
you
it
may
sound
sacrilegious
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
even
possible
god
may
be
a
biped
the
bishop
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
rose
with
flaming
eyes
and
stood
in
the
aisle
airedale
and
several
other
prominent
members
of
the
church
burst
into
threatening
growls
a
wild
bark
and
clamour
broke
from
towser
the
sunday
school
superintendent
and
his
pupils
who
sat
in
the
little
gallery
over
the
door
and
then
to
gissing
horror
and
amazement
poodle
appeared
from
behind
a
pillar
where
he
had
been
chafing
unseen
in
a
fierce
tenor
voice
shaken
with
indignation
he
cried
heretic
and
hypocrite
pay
no
attention
to
his
abominable
nonsense
he
deserted
his
family
to
lead
a
life
of
pleasure
seize
him
cried
the
bishop
in
a
voice
of
thunder
the
church
was
now
in
an
uproar
a
shrill
yapping
sounded
among
the
choir
airedale
swooned
the
bishop
progress
up
the
aisle
was
impeded
by
a
number
of
ladies
hastening
for
an
exit
old
dingo
the
sexton
seized
the
in
the
porch
and
set
up
a
furious
pealing
cries
of
rage
mingled
with
hysterical
howls
from
the
ladies
gissing
trembling
with
horror
surveyed
the
atrocious
hubbub
but
it
was
high
time
to
move
or
his
retreat
would
be
cut
off
he
abandoned
his
manuscript
and
bounded
down
the
pulpit
stairs
unfrock
him
yelled
poodle
he
never
been
frocked
roared
the
bishop
impostor
cried
airedale
excommunicate
him
screamed
towser
take
him
before
the
consistory
shouted
poodle
gissing
started
toward
the
vestry
door
but
was
delayed
by
the
mass
of
scuffling
who
had
seized
this
uncomprehended
diversion
as
a
chance
to
settle
some
scores
of
their
own
the
clamour
was
maddening
the
bishop
leapt
the
chancel
rail
and
was
about
to
seize
him
when
miss
airedale
loyal
to
the
last
interposed
she
flung
herself
upon
the
bishop
run
run
she
cried
they
kill
you
gissing
profited
by
this
assistance
he
pushed
over
the
lectern
upon
poodle
who
was
clutching
at
his
surplice
he
checked
airedale
by
hurling
little
tommy
bull
one
of
the
choir
bodily
at
him
teeth
fastened
automatically
upon
airedale
ear
the
surplice
which
poodle
was
still
holding
parted
with
a
rip
and
gissing
was
free
with
a
yell
of
defiance
he
tore
through
the
vestry
and
round
behind
the
chapel
he
could
not
help
pausing
a
moment
to
scan
the
amazing
scene
which
had
been
all
sabbath
calm
a
few
moments
before
from
the
long
line
of
motor
cars
parked
outside
the
chapel
incredible
chauffeurs
were
leaping
hurrying
to
see
what
had
happened
the
shady
grove
shook
with
the
hideous
clamour
of
the
bell
still
wildly
tolled
by
the
frantic
sexton
the
sudden
excitement
had
liberated
private
quarrels
long
decently
repressed
in
the
porch
retriever
and
were
locked
in
combat
with
a
splintering
crash
one
of
the
came
sailing
through
a
window
evidently
thrown
by
some
infuriated
adult
he
recognized
the
voice
of
towser
raised
in
vigorous
lamentation
to
judge
by
the
sound
towser
pupils
had
turned
upon
him
and
were
giving
him
a
bad
time
above
all
he
could
hear
the
clear
of
miss
airedale
and
the
embittered
yells
of
poodle
then
from
the
quaking
edifice
burst
bishop
borzoi
foaming
with
wrath
his
clothes
much
tattered
and
followed
by
poodle
airedale
and
several
others
they
cast
about
for
a
moment
and
then
the
bishop
saw
him
with
a
joint
halloo
they
launched
toward
him
there
was
no
time
to
lose
he
fled
down
the
shady
path
between
the
trees
but
with
a
hopeless
horror
in
his
heart
he
could
not
long
outdistance
such
a
runner
as
the
bishop
whose
tremendous
strides
would
surely
overhaul
him
in
the
end
if
only
he
had
known
how
to
drive
a
car
he
might
have
commandeered
one
of
the
long
row
waiting
by
the
gate
but
he
was
no
motorist
miss
airedale
could
have
saved
him
in
her
racing
roadster
but
she
had
not
emerged
from
the
melee
in
the
chapel
perhaps
the
bishop
had
bitten
her
his
blood
warmed
with
anger
it
happened
that
they
had
been
mending
the
county
highways
and
a
large
steam
roller
stood
a
few
hundred
feet
down
the
road
drawn
up
beside
the
ditch
gissing
knew
that
it
was
customary
to
leave
these
engines
with
the
fire
banked
and
a
gentle
pressure
of
steam
simmering
in
the
boiler
it
was
his
only
chance
and
he
seized
it
but
to
his
dismay
when
he
reached
the
machine
which
lay
just
round
a
bend
in
the
road
he
found
it
shrouded
with
a
huge
tarpaulin
however
this
suggested
a
desperate
chance
he
whipped
nimbly
inside
the
covering
and
hid
in
the
lying
there
he
heard
the
chase
go
panting
by
as
soon
as
he
dared
he
climbed
out
stripped
off
the
canvas
and
gazed
at
the
bulky
engine
it
was
one
of
those
very
tall
and
impressive
rollers
with
a
canopy
over
the
top
the
machinery
was
not
complicated
and
the
ingenuity
of
desperation
spurred
him
on
hurriedly
he
opened
the
draughts
in
the
shook
up
the
coals
and
saw
the
needle
begin
to
quiver
on
the
he
experimented
with
one
or
two
levers
and
handles
the
first
one
he
touched
let
off
a
loud
scream
from
the
whistle
then
he
discovered
the
throttle
he
opened
it
a
few
notches
cautiously
the
ponderous
machine
with
a
horrible
clanking
and
grinding
began
to
move
forward
a
steam
roller
may
seem
the
least
helpful
of
all
vehicles
in
which
to
conduct
an
urgent
flight
but
gissing
reasoning
was
sound
in
the
first
place
no
one
would
expect
to
find
a
hunted
fugitive
in
this
lumbering
sluggish
behemoth
of
the
road
secondly
sitting
perched
high
up
in
the
driving
saddle
right
under
the
canopy
he
was
not
easily
seen
by
the
casual
and
thirdly
if
the
pursuit
came
to
close
grips
he
was
still
in
a
strategic
position
for
this
the
most
versatile
of
all
except
the
military
tank
can
move
across
fields
crash
through
underbrush
and
travel
in
a
hundred
places
that
would
stall
a
motor
car
he
rumbled
off
down
the
road
somewhat
exhilarated
he
found
the
scarlet
stole
twisted
round
his
neck
and
tied
it
to
one
of
the
stanchions
of
the
canopy
as
a
flag
of
defiance
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
the
posse
of
pursuit
returning
along
the
road
very
hot
and
angry
he
crunched
along
solemnly
busying
himself
to
get
up
a
strong
head
of
steam
there
they
were
the
bishop
poodle
airedale
and
towser
poodle
was
talking
excitedly
the
bishop
tongue
ran
in
and
out
over
his
gleaming
teeth
he
was
not
saying
much
but
his
manner
was
full
of
deadly
wrath
they
paid
no
attention
to
the
roller
and
were
about
to
pass
it
without
even
looking
up
when
gissing
in
a
sudden
fit
of
indignation
gave
the
wheel
a
quick
twirl
and
turned
his
clumsy
engine
upon
them
they
escaped
only
by
a
hair
breadth
from
being
flattened
out
like
pastry
then
the
bishop
looking
up
recognized
the
renegade
with
a
cry
of
anger
they
all
leaped
at
the
roller
but
he
was
so
high
above
them
they
had
no
chance
he
seized
the
and
whanged
poodle
across
the
skull
the
bishop
came
dangerously
near
reaching
him
but
gissing
released
a
jet
of
scalding
steam
from
an
which
gave
the
impetuous
prelate
much
cause
for
grief
a
lump
of
coal
accurately
thrown
discouraged
airedale
towser
attacking
on
the
other
side
of
the
engine
managed
to
scramble
up
so
high
that
he
carried
away
the
embroidered
stole
but
otherwise
the
fugitive
had
all
the
best
of
it
burned
his
feet
trying
to
climb
up
the
side
of
the
boiler
from
the
summit
of
his
uncouth
vehicle
gissing
looked
down

miserable
freethinker
said

shall
be
tried
by
the
assembly

a
mere
lay

quoted
gissing
a
slight
laxity
is
allowable
you
had
better
go
back
and
calm
down
the
congregation
or
they
tear
the
chapel
to
bits
this
kind
of
thing
will
have
a
very
bad
influence
on
church
they
shouted
additional
menace
but
gissing
had
already
started
his
deafening
machinery
and
could
not
hear
what
was
said
he
left
them
bickering
by
the
roadside
for
fear
of
further
pursuit
he
turned
off
the
highway
a
little
beyond
and
rumbled
noisily
down
a
rustic
lane
between
high
banks
and
hedges
where
sumac
was
turning
red
strangely
enough
there
was
something
very
comforting
about
his
enormous
crawling
contraption
it
was
docile
and
reliable
like
an
elephant
the
crashing
clangour
of
its
movement
was
soon
forgotten
became
in
fact
an
actual
stimulus
to
thought
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
novelty
he
steered
through
a
copse
and
took
joy
in
seeing
the
monster
thrash
its
way
through
thickets
and
brambles
and
then
across
a
field
of
crackling
stubble
steering
toward
the
lonelier
regions
of
that
farming
country
presently
he
halted
in
a
dingle
of
birches
beside
a
small
pond
he
spent
some
time
very
happily
carefully
studying
the
machinery
he
found
some
waste
and
an
oilcan
in
the
and
polished
until
the
metal
shone
the
water
looked
rather
low
in
the
gauge
and
he
replenished
it
from
the
pool
it
was
while
grooming
the
roller
that
it
struck
him
his
own
appearance
was
unusual
for
a
highway
mechanic
he
was
still
wearing
the
famous
floorwalker
suit
which
he
had
punctiliously
donned
every
sunday
for
chapel
but
he
had
had
to
flee
without
a
hat
even
without
his
luggage
which
was
neatly
packed
in
a
bag
in
the
vestry
that
he
felt
sure
poodle
had
already
burst
open
for
evidences
of
heresy
and
schism
the
pearly
trousers
were
stained
with
oil
and
the
neat
cutaway
coat
bore
smears
of
as
long
as
he
stuck
to
the
roller
and
the
telltale
garments
pursuit
and
identification
would
of
course
be
easy
enough
but
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
machine
he
decided
not
to
abandon
it
yet
obviously
it
was
better
to
keep
to
the
roads
where
the
engine
would
at
any
rate
be
less
surprisingly
conspicuous
and
where
it
would
leave
no
trail
so
he
made
a
long
circuit
across
meadows
and
pastures
carrying
a
devilish
clamour
into
the
quiet
sunday
afternoon
regaining
a
macadam
surface
he
set
oil
at
random
causing
considerable
annoyance
to
the
motoring
public
finding
that
his
cutaway
coat
caused
jeers
and
merriment
he
removed
it
and
when
any
one
showed
a
disposition
to
inquire
he
explained
that
he
was
doing
penance
for
an
wager
his
oscillating
perch
above
the
boiler
was
extraordinarily
warm
and
he
bought
a
gallon
jug
of
cider
from
a
farmer
by
the
way
cheering
himself
with
this
and
reviewing
in
his
mind
the
queer
experiences
of
the
past
months
he
went
thundering
mildly
on
at
first
he
had
feared
a
furious
pursuit
on
the
part
of
the
bishop
or
even
a
whole
college
of
bishops
quickly
mobilized
for
the
event
he
had
imagined
them
speeding
after
him
in
a
huge
and
himself
keeping
them
at
bay
with
lumps
of
coal
but
gradually
he
realized
that
the
bishop
would
not
further
jeopardize
his
dignity
or
run
the
risk
of
making
himself
ridiculous
poodle
would
undoubtedly
set
the
township
road
commissioner
on
his
trail
and
he
would
be
liable
to
seizure
for
the
theft
of
a
steam
roller
but
that
could
hardly
happen
so
quickly
in
the
meantime
a
plan
had
been
forming
in
his
mind
but
it
would
require
darkness
for
its
execution
darkness
did
not
delay
in
coming
as
he
jolted
cheerfully
from
road
to
road
holding
up
long
strings
of
motors
at
every
corner
while
he
jovially
held
out
his
arm
as
a
sign
that
he
was
going
to
turn
dark
purple
clouds
were
massing
and
piling
up
foreseeing
a
storm
he
bought
some
provisions
at
a
roadhouse
and
turned
into
a
field
where
he
camped
in
the
lee
of
a
forest
of
birches
he
cooked
himself
an
excellent
supper
toasting
bread
and
frankfurters
in
the
firebox
of
the
roller
with
boiling
water
from
a
he
brewed
a
panikin
of
tea
and
sat
placidly
admiring
the
light
on
wide
pampas
of
bronze
grasses
tawny
as
a
panther
hide
a
strong
wind
began
to
draw
from
the
southeast
he
lit
the
lantern
at
the
rear
of
the
machine
and
by
the
time
the
rain
came
hissing
upon
the
hot
boiler
he
was
ready
luckily
he
had
saved
the
tarpaulin
he
spread
this
on
the
ground
underneath
the
roller
and
curled
up
in
it
the
glow
from
the
firebox
kept
him
warm
and
dry
summer
is
over
he
said
to
himself
as
he
heard
the
clash
and
spouting
of
rain
all
about
him
he
lay
for
some
time
not
sleepy
thinking
theology
and
enjoying
the
close
tumult
of
wind
and
weather
people
who
have
had
an
arm
or
a
leg
amputated
he
reflected
say
they
can
still
feel
pains
in
the
absent
member
well
there
an
analogy
in
that
modern
skepticism
has
amputated
god
from
the
heart
but
there
is
still
a
twinge
where
the
arteries
were
sewn
up
he
slept
peacefully
until
about
two
in
the
morning
except
when
a
coal
slipping
through
the
burned
a
lamentable
hole
in
his
trousers
when
he
woke
the
night
still
dripped
but
was
clear
aloft
he
started
the
engine
and
drove
cautiously
along
black
slippery
roads
to
poodle
house
in
spite
of
the
unavoidable
racket
no
one
stirred
he
surmised
that
the
curate
slept
soundly
after
the
crises
of
the
day
he
left
the
engine
by
the
doorstep
pinning
a

after

had
settled
into
their

were
telling
each

how
much
they
loved

captain
scottie
had
taken
his
afternoon
constitutional
on
his
private
strip
of
starboard
deck
just
aft
the
bridge
and
was
sitting
in
his
comfortable
cabin
expecting
a
cup
of
tea
he
was
a
fine
old
squat
grizzled
severe
with
wiry
eyebrows
a
short
coarse
beard
and
watchful
quick
eyes
a
characteristic
scot
beneath
his
reticent
conscientious
dignity
there
was
abundant
humour
and
affection
he
would
have
been
recognized
anywhere
as
a

short
solid
legs
were
perfectly
adapted
for

stood
by

into

stiff

his
mouth
always
held
a
pipe

he
smoked
in
short

say
they
found
someone
stowed
away
in
the
linen
locker
sir
queer
kind
of
fellow
sir
talks
a
bit
like
a
padre
must
come
aboard
by
the
gangway
sir
and
climbed
into
that
locker
near
the
barber
the
problem
of
stowaways
is
familiar
enough
to
shipmasters
send
him
up
to
me
said
the
captain
a
few
minutes
later
gissing
appeared
escorted
by
a
burly
quartermaster
even
the
experienced
captain
admitted
to
himself
that
this
was
something
new
in
the
category
of
stowaways
never
before
had
he
seen
one
in
a
braided
cutaway
coat
and
wedding
trousers
it
was
true
that
the
garments
were
in
grievous
condition
but
they
were
worn
with
an
air
the
stowaway
face
showed
some
embarrassment
but
not
at
all
the
usual
hangdog
mien
of
such
wastrels
involuntarily
his
tongue
moistened
when
he
saw
the
tray
of
tea
for
he
had
not
eaten
since
his
supper
on
the
steam
roller
the
night
before
but
he
kept
his
eyes
politely
averted
from
the
food
they
rose
to
a
girder
that
ran
athwart
the
cabin
ceiling
certified
to
accommodate
the
master
he
read
there
in
letters
deeply
incised
into
the
thick
paint
a
good
christian
ship
he
said
to
himself
it
sounds
like
the
he
was
pleased
to
think
that
his
suspicion
was
already
confirmed
ships
were
more
religious
than
anything
on
land
the
captain
dismissed
the
quartermaster
and
addressed
himself
sternly
to
the
culprit
well
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
please
captain
said
gissing
politely
do
not
allow
your
tea
to
get
cold
i
can
talk
while
you
behind
his
grim
demeanour
the
captain
was
very
near
to
smiling
at
this
naivete
no
briton
is
wholly
implacable
at
and
he
felt
a
genuine
curiosity
about
this
unusual
offender
what
was
your
idea
in
coming
aboard
he
said
do
you
know
that
i
can
put
you
in
irons
until
we
get
across
and
then
have
you
sent
home
for
punishment
i
suppose
it
the
old
story
you
want
to
go
on
the
other
side
no
captain
said
gissing
i
have
come
to
sea
to
study
in
spite
of
himself
the
captain
was
touched
by
this
amazing
statement
he
was
a
scot
as
we
have
said
he
poured
a
cup
of
tea
to
conceal
his
astonishment
theology
he
exclaimed
the
theology
of
hard
work
is
what
you
will
find
most
of
aboard
ship
carry
on
and
do
your
duty
keep
a
sharp
lookout
all
gear
shipshape
salute
the
bridge
when
going
on
watch
that
is
the
whole
duty
of
a
good
officer
that
plenty
theology
for
a
but
the
skipper
eye
turned
brightly
toward
his
bookshelves
where
he
had
several
volumes
of
sermons
mostly
of
a
calvinist
sort
i
am
not
afraid
of
work
said
gissing
but
i
looking
for
horizons
in
my
work
ashore
i
never
could
find
your
horizon
is
likely
to
be
peeling
potatoes
in
the
galley
remarked
the
captain
i
understand
they
are
there
or
sweeping
out
bunks
in
the
steerage
ethics
of
the
dust
what
would
you
say
to
that
sir
replied
gissing
i
shall
be
grateful
for
any
task
however
menial
that
permits
me
to
meditate
i
understand
your
point
of
view
by
coming
aboard
your
ship
i
have
broken
the
law
i
have
committed
a
crime
but
not
a
sin
crime
and
sin
every
theologian
admits
are
not
the
captain
sailed
into
argument
what
he
cried
are
you
aware
of
the
doctrine
of
moral
inability
in
a
fallen
state
sit
down
sit
down
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
we
must
discuss
he
rang
for
the
steward
and
ordered
an
extra
cup
and
a
fresh
supply
of
toast
at
that
moment
gissing
heard
two
quick
strokes
of
a
bell
rung
somewhere
forward
a
clear
musical
melancholy
tone
echoed
promptly
in
other
parts
of
the
ship
what
is
that
captain
he
asked
anxiously
an
accident
two
bells
in
the
first
said
the
captain
i
fear
you
are
as
much
a
lubber
at
sea
as
you
are
in
the
next
two
hours
passed
like
a
flash
gissing
found
the
skipper
in
spite
of
his
occasional
moods
of
austerity
a
delicious
companion
they
discussed
theosophy
spiritualism
and
christian
science
all
of
which
the
captain
with
sturdy
but
rather
troubled
vehemence
linked
with
primitive
magic
gissing
seeing
that
his
only
hope
of
establishing
himself
in
the
sailor
regard
was
to
disagree
and
keep
the
argument
going
plunged
into
and
the
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
rather
unwarily
he
ventured
to
introduce
a
nautical
illustration
into
the
talk
your
compass
needle
he
said
points
to
the
north
pole
and
although
it
has
never
been
to
the
pole
and
can
not
even
conceive
of
it
yet
it
testifies
irresistibly
to
the
existence
of
such
a
i
trust
you
navigate
your
soul
more
skilfully
than
you
would
navigate
this
vessel
retorted
the
captain
in
the
first
place
the
needle
does
not
point
to
the
north
pole
at
all
but
to
the
magnetic
pole
furthermore
it
has
to
be
adjusted
by
magnets
to
counteract
deviation
gissing
you
may
be
a
sincere
student
of
theology
but
you
have
not
allowed
for
your
own
temperamental
deviation
why
even
the
gyro
compass
has
to
be
adjusted
for
latitude
error
you
landsmen
think
that
a
ship
is
simply
a
floating
hotel
i
should
like
to
have
the
bishop
you
spoke
of
study
a
little
navigation
that
would
put
into
him
a
healthy
respect
for
the
marvels
of
science
on
board
ship
sir
the
binnacle
is
kept
locked
and
the
key
is
on
the
of
the
master
it
should
be
so
in
all
intellectual
matters
confide
them
to
those
capable
of
gissing
saw
that
the
captain
greatly
relished
his
sense
of
superiority
so
he
made
a
remark
of
intentional
simplicity
the
binnacle
he
said
i
thought
that
was
the
little
shellfish
that
clings
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
do
you
dare
call
my
ship
a
boat
said
the
captain
at
sea
a
boat
means
only
a
lifeboat
or
some
other
small
vagabond
craft
come
out
on
the
bridge
and
i
show
you
a
thing
or
the
evening
had
closed
in
hazy
and
the
pomerania
swung
steadily
in
a
long
plunging
roll
at
the
weather
wing
of
the
bridge
gazing
sharply
over
the
canvas

the
vigilant
chief
officer
peering
off
rigidly
as
though
mesmerized
but
saying
nothing
he
gave
the
captain
a
courteous
salute
but
kept
silence
at
the
large
mahogany
wheel
gently
steadying
it
to
the
quarterly
roll
of
the
sea
stood
dane
a
tall
solemn
quartermaster
in
spite
of
a
little
uneasiness
due
to
the
unfamiliar
motion
gissing
was
greatly
elated
by
the
wheelhouse
which
seemed
even
more
thrillingly
romantic
than
any
pulpit
uncomprehendingly
but
with
admiration
he
examined
the
binnacle
the
telegraphs
the
telephones
the
rack
of
the
buttons
for
closing
the
bulkheads
and
the
rotating
screen
for
lookout
in
thick
weather
aloft
he
could
see
the
masthead
light
gently
soaring
in
slow
arcs
i
show
you
my
particular
pride
said
the
captain
evidently
pleased
by
his
visitor
delighted
enthusiasm
gissing
wondered
what
ingenious
device
of
science
this
might
be
captain
scottie
stepped
to
the
weather
gunwale
of
the
bridge
he
pointed
to
the
smoke
which
was
rolling
rapidly
from
the
funnels
you
see
he
said
there
quite
a
strong
breeze
blowing
but
look
he
lit
a
match
and
held
it
unshielded
above
the
canvas
screen
which
was
lashed
along
the
front
of
the
bridge
to
gissing
surprise
it
burned
steadily
without
blowing
out
i
invented
a
convex
which
splits
the
air
just
forward
of
the
bridge
i
can
stand
here
and
light
my
pipe
in
the
stiffest
gale
without
any
on
the
decks
below
gissing
heard
a
bugle
blowing
gaily
a
bright
persuasive
sound
six
bells
the
captain
said
i
must
dress
for
dinner
before
i
start
you
i
should
like
to
clear
up
that
little
discussion
of
ours
about
free
will
one
or
two
things
you
said
interested
he
paced
the
bridge
for
a
minute
thinking
hard
i
test
your
sincerity
he
said
you
can
bunk
in
the
i
have
some
dinner
sent
up
to
you
i
wish
you
would
write
me
an
essay
of
say
two
thousand
words
on
the
subject
of
for
a
moment
gissing
pondered
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
be
put
in
irons
and
rationed
with
bread
and
water
the
wind
was
freshening
and
the
pomerania
sharp
bow
slid
heavily
into
broad
hills
of
sea
crashing
them
into
crumbling
rollers
of
suds
which
fell
outward
and
hissed
along
her
steep
sides
the
silent
pointer
escorted
him
into
the
a
bare
businesslike
place
with
a
large
table
a
and
a
settee
here
presently
a
steward
appeared
with
excellent
viands
and
a
pen
ink
and
notepaper
after
a
cautious
meal
gissing
felt
more
comfortable
there
is
something
about
a
wet
windy
evening
at
sea
that
turns
the
mind
naturally
toward
metaphysics
he
pushed
away
the
dishes
and
began
to
write
later
in
the
evening
the
captain
reappeared
he
looked
pleased
when
he
saw
a
number
of
sheets
already
covered
with
script
rum
lot
of
passengers
this
trip
he
said
i
do
seem
to
see
any
who
look
interesting
all
big
business
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
must
say
it
nice
to
have
someone
who
can
talk
about
books
and
so
on
once
in
a
gissing
realized
that
sometimes
a
shipmaster
life
must
be
a
lonely
one
the
weight
of
responsibility
is
always
upon
him
etiquette
prevents
his
becoming
familiar
with
his
officers
small
wonder
if
he
pines
occasionally
for
a
little
congenial
talk
to
relieve
his
mind
big
business
did
you
say
gissing
remarked
ah
i
could
write
you
quite
an
essay
about
that
i
used
to
be
general
manager
of
beagle
and
come
into
my
cabin
and
have
a
liqueur
said
the
skipper
let
the
essay
go
until
the
captain
turned
on
the
electric
stove
in
his
cabin
for
the
night
was
cold
it
was
a
snug
sanctum
at
the
portholes
were
little
chintz
curtains
over
the
bunk
was
a
convenient
reading
lamp
on
the
wall
a
brass
pendulum
swung
slowly
registering
the
roll
of
the
ship
the
ruddy
shine
of
the
stove
lit
up
the
orderly
desk
and
the
photographs
of
the
captain
family
yours
said
gissing
looking
at
a
group
of
three
puppies
with
droll
scottish
faces
aye
said
the
captain
i
three
of
my
own
said
gissing
with
a
private
pang
of
homesickness
the
skipper
cosy
quarters
were
the
most
truly
domestic
he
had
seen
since
the
evening
he
first
fled
from
responsibility
captain
scottie
was
surprised
certainly
this
eccentric
stranger
in
the
badly
damaged
wedding
garments
had
not
given
the
impression
of
a
family
head
just
then
the
steward
entered
with
a
decanter
of
benedictine
and
small
glasses
brew
days
and
bonny
said
the
captain
raising
his
crystal
secure
amidst
perils
replied
gissing
courteously
it
was
the
phrase
engraved
upon
the
ship
notepaper
on
which
he
had
been
writing
and
it
had
impressed
itself
on
his
mind
you
said
you
had
been
a
general
gissing
told
with
some
vivacity
of
his
experiences
in
the
world
of
trade
the
captain
poured
another
small
liqueur
they
fine
halesome
liquor
he
said
sincerely
yours
said
gissing
nodding
over
the
glass
he
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
at
home
in
the
navigating
quarters
of
the
ship
and
hoped
the
might
be
postponed
as
long
as
possible
how
far
had
you
got
in
your
essay
asked
the
captain
not
very
far
i
fear
i
was
beginning
by
laying
down
a
few
psychological
excellent
will
you
read
it
to
me
gissing
went
to
get
his
manuscript
and
read
it
aloud
the
captain
listened
attentively
puffing
clouds
of
smoke
i
am
sorry
this
is
such
a
short
voyage
he
said
when
gissing
finished
you
have
approached
the
matter
from
an
entirely
naif
and
instinctive
standpoint
and
it
will
take
some
time
to
show
you
your
errors
before
i
demolish
your
arguments
i
should
like
to
turn
them
over
in
my
mind
i
will
reduce
my
ideas
to
writing
and
then
read
them
to
i
should
like
nothing
better
said
gissing
and
i
can
think
over
the
subject
more
carefully
while
i
peel
the
nonsense
said
the
captain
i
do
not
often
get
a
chance
to
discuss
theology
i
will
tell
you
my
idea
you
spoke
of
your
experience
as
general
manager
when
you
had
charge
of
a
thousand
employees
one
of
the
things
we
need
on
this
ship
is
a
to
take
over
the
management
of
the
personnel
that
would
permit
me
to
concentrate
entirely
on
navigation
in
a
vessel
of
this
size
it
is
wrong
that
the
master
should
have
to
carry
the
entire
he
rang
for
the
steward
my
compliments
to
pointer
and
tell
him
to
come
pointer
appeared
shortly
in
oilskins
saluted
and
gazed
fixedly
at
his
superior
with
one
foot
raised
upon
the
brass
mr
pointer
said
captain
scottie
i
have
appointed
captain
gissing
take
orders
from
him
as
you
would
from
me
he
will
have
complete
charge
of
the
ship
aye
aye
sir
said
pointer
stood
a
moment
intently
to
see
if
there
were
further
orders
saluted
again
and
withdrew
now
you
had
better
turn
in
said
the
skipper
of
course
you
must
wear
uniform
i
send
the
tailor
up
to
you
at
once
he
can
remodel
one
of
my
suits
overnight
the
trousers
will
have
to
be
on
the
sofa
gissing
dozed
and
waked
and
dozed
again
on
the
bridge
near
by
he
heard
the
steady
tread
of
feet
the
mysterious
words
of
the
officer
on
watch
passing
the
course
to
his
relief
bells
rang
with
sharp
double
clang
through
the
open
port
he
could
hear
the
alternate
boom
and
hiss
of
the
sea
under
the
bows
with
the
stately
lift
and
lean
of
the
ship
there
mingled
a
faint
driving
vibration
chapter
fourteen
the
first
morning
in
any
new
environment
is
always
the
most
exciting
gissing
was
already
awake
and
watching
the
novel
sight
of
a
patch
of
sunshine
sliding
to
and
fro
on
the
deck
of
the
when
there
was
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
the
captain
steward
entered
carrying
a
handsome
uniform
six
bells
sir
he
said
your
bath
is
laid
gissing
was
not
very
sure
just
what
time
it
was
but
the
steward
held
out
a
dressing
gown
for
him
to
slip
on
so
he
took
the
hint
and
followed
him
to
the
captain
private
bathroom
where
he
plunged
gaily
into
warm
salt
water
he
was
hardly
dressed
before
breakfast
was
laid
for
him
in
the
it
was
a
breakfast
greatly
to
his
liking
porridge
scrambled
eggs
grilled
kidneys
and
bacon
coffee
toast
and
marmalade
evidently
the
hardships
of
sea
life
had
been
greatly
exaggerated
by
fiction
writers
he
was
a
trifle
bashful
about
appearing
on
the
bridge
in
his
blue
and
brass
formality
and
waited
a
while
thinking
captain
scottie
might
come
but
no
one
disturbed
him
so
by
and
bye
he
went
out
it
was
a
brisk
morning
with
a
fresh
breeze
and
plenty
of
whitecaps
dancing
rainbows
hovered
about
the
bow
when
an
occasional
explosion
of
spray
burst
up
into
sunlight
pointer
was
on
the
bridge
still
gazing
steadily
into
the
distance
he
saluted
gissing
but
said
nothing
the
quartermaster
at
the
wheel
also
saluted
in
silence
a
seaman
wiping
down
the
paintwork
on
the
deckhouse
saluted
gissing
returned
these
gestures
punctiliously
and
began
to
pace
the
bridge
from
side
to
side
he
soon
grew
accustomed
to
the
varying
slant
of
the
deck
and
felt
that
his
footing
showed
a
nautical
assurance
now
for
the
first
time
he
enjoyed
an
untrammelled
horizon
on
all
sides
the
sea
he
observed
was
not
really
blue
not
at
any
rate
the
blue
he
had
supposed
where
it
seethed
flatly
along
the
hull
laced
with
swirls
of
milky
foam
it
was
almost
black
farther
away
it
was
green
or
darkly
violet
a
ladder
led
to
the
top
of
the
charthouse
and
from
this
commanding
height
the
whole
body
of
the
ship
lay
below
him
how
alive
she
seemed
how
full
of
personality
the
strong
funnels
the
tall
masts
that
moved
so
delicately
against
the
pale
open
sky
the
distant
stern
that
now
dipped
low
in
a
comfortable
hollow
and
now
soared
and
threshed
onward
with
a
swimming
thrust
the
whole
vital
organism
spoke
to
the
eye
and
the
imagination
in
the
centre
of
this
vast
circle
she
moved
royal
and
serene
she
was
more
beautiful
than
the
element
she
rode
on
for
perhaps
there
was
something
meaningless
in
that
pure
vacant
round
of
sea
and
sky
once
its
immense
azure
was
grasped
and
noted
it
brought
nothing
to
the
mind
reason
was
indignant
to
conceive
it
sloping
endlessly
away
the
placid
beautifully
planned
routine
of
shipboard
passed
on
its
accustomed
course
and
he
began
to
suspect
that
his
was
a
sinecure
down
below
he
could
see
the
passengers
briskly
promenading
or
drowsing
under
their
rugs
on
the
hurricane
deck
aft
a
sailor
was
chalking
a
shuffleboard
court
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
this
might
become
monotonous
unless
he
found
some
actual
part
in
it
just
then
captain
scottie
appeared
on
the
bridge
took
a
quick
look
round
and
joined
him
on
top
of
the
charthouse
good
morning
he
said
you
wo
think
me
rude
if
you
do
see
much
of
me
thinking
about
those
ideas
of
yours
i
have
come
upon
some
rather
puzzling
stuff
i
must
work
the
whole
thing
out
more
clearly
your
suggestion
that
conscience
points
the
way
to
an
integration
of
personality
into
a
higher
type
of
divinity
seems
to
me
off
the
track
but
i
have
quite
downed
it
yet
i
going
to
shut
myself
up
and
consider
the
matter
i
leave
you
in
i
shall
be
perfectly
happy
said
gissing
please
do
worry
about
you
suggest
that
all
the
conditions
of
life
at
sea
our
mastery
of
the
forces
of
nature
and
so
on
seem
to
show
that
we
have
perfect
freedom
of
will
and
adapt
everything
to
our
desires
i
believe
just
the
contrary
the
forces
of
nature
compel
us
to
approach
them
in
their
own
way
otherwise
we
are
shipwrecked
it
is
in
the
conditions
of
nature
that
this
ship
should
reach
port
in
eight
days
otherwise
we
should
get
nowhere
we
do
it
because
it
is
our
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
said
gissing
but
the
captain
had
already
departed
with
a
clouded
brow
on
the
roof
gissing
had
discovered
an
alluring
instrument
the
exact
use
of
which
he
did
not
know
it
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
steering
control
the
dial
was
lettered
from
left
to
right
as
follows
hard
a
port
port
steady
course
steady
starbd
hard
a
starbd
at
present
the
handle
stood
upon
the
section
marked
course
after
a
careful
study
of
the
whole
seascape
it
seemed
to
gissing
that
off
to
the
south
the
ocean
looked
more
blue
and
more
interesting
after
some
hesitation
he
moved
the
handle
to
the
port
mark
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
to
his
delight
he
saw
the
bow
swing
slowly
round
and
the
pomerania
gleaming
wake
spread
behind
her
in
a
whitened
curve
he
descended
to
the
bridge
a
little
nervous
as
to
what
pointer
might
say
but
he
found
the
mate
gazing
across
the
water
with
the
same
fierce
and
unwearying
attention
i
have
changed
the
course
he
said
pointer
saluted
but
said
nothing
having
succeeded
so
far
gissing
ventured
upon
another
innovation
he
had
been
greatly
tempted
by
the
wheel
and
envied
the
stolid
quartermaster
who
was
steering
so
assuming
an
air
of
calm
certainty
he
entered
the
wheelhouse
i
take
her
for
a
while
he
said
aye
aye
sir
said
the
quartermaster
and
surrendered
the
wheel
to
him
you
might
string
out
a
few
flags
gissing
said
he
had
been
noticing
the
bright
signal
buntings
in
the
rack
and
thought
it
a
pity
not
to
use
them
i
like
to
see
a
ship
well
dressed
he
added
aye
aye
sir
said
dane
any
choice
sir
gissing
picked
out
a
string
of
flags
which
were
particularly
lively
in
and
had
them
hoisted
then
he
gave
his
attention
to
the
wheel
he
found
it
quite
an
art
and
was
surprised
to
learn
that
a
big
ship
requires
so
much
helm
but
it
was
very
pleasant
he
took
care
to
steer
toward
patches
of
sea
that
looked
interesting
and
to
cut
into
any
particular
waves
that
took
his
fancy
after
an
hour
or
so
he
sighted
a
fishing
schooner
and
gave
chase
he
found
it
so
much
fun
to
run
close
beside
her
taking
care
to
pass
to
leeward
so
as
not
to
cut
off
her
wind
that
a
mile
farther
on
he
turned
and
steered
a
neat
circle
about
the
bewildered
craft
the
pomerania
passengers
were
greatly
interested
and
lined
the
rails
trying
to
make
out
what
the
fishermen
were
shouting
the
captain
of
the
schooner
seemed
particularly
agitated
kept
waving
at
the
signal
flags
and
barking
through
a
megaphone
during
these
manoeuvres
pointer
gazed
so
hard
at
the
horizon
that
gissing
felt
a
bit
embarrassed
i
thought
it
wise
to
find
out
exactly
what
our
is
he
said
pointer
saluted
he
was
a
officer
late
in
the
afternoon
the
captain
reappeared
looking
more
cheerful
gissing
was
still
at
the
helm
which
he
found
so
fascinating
he
would
not
relinquish
it
he
had
ordered
his
tea
served
on
a
little
stand
beside
the
wheel
so
that
he
could
drink
it
while
he
steered
hullo
said
the
captain
i
see
you
changed
the
it
seemed
best
to
do
so
said
gissing
firmly
he
felt
that
to
show
any
weakness
at
this
point
would
be
fatal
oh
well
probably
it
does
matter
i
coming
round
to
some
of
your
gissing
saw
that
this
would
never
do
unless
he
could
keep
the
master
disturbed
by
philosophic
doubts
scottie
would
expect
to
resume
command
of
the
ship
well
he
said
i
been
thinking
about
it
too
i
believe
i
went
a
bit
too
far
but
what
do
you
think
about
this
do
you
believe
that
conscience
is
inherited
or
acquired
you
sea
how
important
that
is
if
conscience
is
a
kind
of
automatic
oracle
infallible
and
perfect
what
becomes
of
free
will
and
if
on
the
other
hand
conscience
is
only
a
laboriously
trained
perception
of
moral
and
social
utilities
where
does
your
deity
come
in
gissing
was
aware
that
this
dilemma
would
not
hold
water
very
long
and
was
painfully
impromptu
but
it
hit
the
captain
amidships
by
jove
he
said
that
terrible
is
it
it
no
use
trying
to
carry
on
until
i
got
that
under
the
hatch
look
here
would
you
mind
just
as
a
favour
keep
things
going
while
i
wrestle
with
that
question
i
know
it
asking
a
lot
but
perhaps
it
quite
all
right
gissing
replied
naturally
you
want
to
work
these
things
the
captain
started
to
leave
the
bridge
but
by
old
seafaring
habit
he
cast
a
keen
glance
at
the
sky
he
saw
the
bright
string
of
code
flags
fluttering
he
seemed
startled
are
you
signalling
any
one
he
asked
no
one
in
particular
i
thought
it
looked
better
to
have
a
few
flags
i
daresay
you
right
but
better
take
them
down
if
you
speak
a
ship
they
rather
confusing
i
thought
they
were
just
to
brighten
things
you
have
two
different
signals
up
they
read
bubonic
plague
give
me
a
wide
berth
am
coming
to
your
toward
dinner
time
when
gissing
had
left
the
wheel
and
was
humming
a
tune
as
he
walked
the
bridge
the
steward
came
to
him
the
captain
compliments
sir
and
would
you
take
his
place
in
the
saloon
he
says
he
very
busy
writing
sir
and
would
take
it
as
a
gissing
was
always
obliging
there
was
just
a
hint
of
conscious
sternness
in
his
manner
as
he
entered
the
pomerania
beautiful
dining
saloon
for
he
wished
the
passengers
to
realize
that
their
lives
depended
upon
his
prudence
and
twice
during
the
meal
he
instructed
the
steward
to
bring
him
the
latest
barometer
reading
and
after
the
dessert
he
scribbled
a
note
on
the
back
of
a
and
had
it
sent
to
the
chief
engineer
it
said
dear
chief
please
keep
up
a
good
head
of
steam
i
am
expecting
dirty
weather
gissing
what
the
chief
said
when
he
received
the
message
is
not
included
in
the
story
but
the
same
social
aplomb
that
had
made
gissing
successful
as
a
floorwalker
now
came
to
his
rescue
as
mariner
the
passengers
at
the
captain
table
were
amazed
at
his
genial
charm
his
anecdotes
of
sea
life
were
heartily
applauded
after
dinner
he
circulated
gracefully
in
the
ladies
lounge
and
took
coffee
there
surrounded
by
a
chattering
bevy
he
organized
a
little
impromptu
concert
in
the
music
room
and
when
that
was
well
started
slipped
away
to
the
here
he
found
a
pool
being
organized
as
to
the
exact
day
and
hour
when
the
pomerania
would
reach
port
appealed
to
for
his
opinion
he
advised
caution
on
all
sides
he
was
in
demand
for
dancing
for
bridge
for
a
recitation
at
length
he
slipped
away
pleading
that
he
must
keep
himself
fit
in
case
of
fog
the
passengers
were
loud
in
his
praise
asserting
that
they
had
never
met
so
agreeable
a
one
elderly
lady
said
she
remembered
crossing
with
him
in
the
old
caninia
years
ago
and
that
he
was
just
the
same
then
chapter
fifteen
and
so
the
voyage
went
on
gissing
was
quite
content
to
do
a
trick
at
the
wheel
both
morning
and
afternoon
and
worked
out
some
new
principles
of
steering
which
gave
him
pleasure
in
the
first
place
he
noticed
that
the
and
quoit
players
on
the
boat
deck
aft
were
occasionally
annoyed
by
cinders
from
the
stacks
so
he
made
it
a
general
plan
to
steer
so
that
the
smoke
blew
at
right
angles
to
the
ship
course
as
the
wind
was
prevailingly
west
this
meant
that
his
general
trend
was
southerly
whenever
he
saw
another
vessel
a
mass
of
floating
a
porpoise
or
even
a
he
steered
directly
for
it
and
passed
as
close
as
possible
to
have
a
good
look
at
it
even
pointer
admitted
in
the
mates
mess
that
he
had
never
experienced
so
eventful
a
voyage
to
keep
the
quartermasters
from
being
idle
gissing
had
them
knit
him
a
rope
hammock
to
be
slung
in
the
he
felt
that
this
would
be
more
nautical
than
a
plush
settee
there
was
a
marvellous
sense
of
power
in
standing
at
the
wheel
and
feeling
the
great
hull
reply
to
his
touch
occasionally
captain
scottie
would
emerge
from
his
cabin
look
round
with
a
faint
surprise
and
come
to
the
bridge
to
see
what
was
happening
pointer
would
salute
mutely
and
continue
to
study
the
skyline
with
indignant
absorption
the
captain
would
approach
the
wheel
where
gissing
was
deep
in
thought
rubbing
his
hands
the
captain
would
say
heartily
well
i
think
got
it
all
clear
gissing
sighed
what
is
it
the
captain
inquired
anxiously
i
bothered
about
the
subconscious
they
tell
us
nowadays
that
it
the
subconscious
mind
that
is
really
important
the
more
mental
operations
we
can
turn
over
to
the
subconscious
realm
the
happier
we
will
be
and
the
more
efficient
morality
theology
and
everything
really
worth
while
as
i
understand
it
spring
from
the
the
captain
look
of
cheer
would
vanish
maybe
there
something
in
if
so
gissing
continued
then
perhaps
consciousness
is
entirely
spurious
it
seems
to
me
that
before
we
can
get
anywhere
at
all
got
to
draw
the
line
between
the
conscious
and
the
subconscious
what
bothers
me
is
am
i
conscious
of
having
a
subconscious
or
not
sometimes
i
think
i
am
and
then
again
i
doubtful
but
if
i
aware
of
my
subconscious
then
it
is
a
genuine
subconscious
and
the
whole
thing
just
another
delusion
the
captain
would
knit
his
brow
and
again
retire
anxiously
to
his
quarters
after
begging
gissing
to
be
generous
and
carry
on
a
while
longer
occasionally
pacing
the
starboard
sacred
to
captains
gissing
would
glance
through
the
port
and
see
the
metaphysical
commander
bent
over
sheets
of
foolscap
and
thickly
wreathed
in
he
himself
had
fallen
into
a
kind
of
tranced
felicity
in
which
these
questions
no
longer
had
other
than
an
ingenious
interest
his
heart
was
drowned
in
the
engulfing
blue
as
they
made
their
southing
wind
and
weather
seemed
to
fall
astern
the
sun
poured
with
a
more
golden
candour
he
stood
at
the
wheel
in
a
tranquil
reverie
blithely
steering
toward
some
bright
belly
of
cloud
that
had
caught
his
fancy
pointer
shook
his
head
when
he
glanced
surreptitiously
at
the
steering
recorder
a
device
that
noted
graphically
every
movement
of
the
rudder
with
a
view
to
promoting
economical
helmsmanship
indeed
gissing
course
as
logged
on
the
chart
surprised
even
himself
so
that
he
forbade
the
officers
taking
their
noon
observations
when
pointer
said
something
about
isobars
the
replied
serenely
that
he
did
not
expect
to
find
any
polar
bears
in
these
latitudes
he
had
hoped
privately
for
an
occasional
pirate
and
scanned
the
sharply
for
suspicious
topsails
but
the
ocean
as
he
remarked
is
not
crowded
they
proceeded
day
after
day
in
a
solitary
wideness
of
unblemished
colour
the
ship
travelling
always
in
the
centre
of
this
infinite
disk
seemed
strangely
identified
with
his
own
itinerant
spirit
watchful
at
the
gist
of
things
alert
at
the
point
which
was
necessarily
for
him
the
nub
of
all
existence
he
wandered
about
the
pomerania
sagely
ordered
passages
and
found
her
more
and
more
magical
she
went
on
and
on
with
some
strange
urgent
vitality
of
her
own
through
the
fiddleys
on
the
boat
deck
came
a
hot
oily
breath
and
the
steady
drumming
of
her
burning
heart
from
outer
to
from
to
he
explored
and
loved
her
in
the
whole
of
her
proud
faithful
obedient
fabric
he
divined
honour
and
exultation
poised
upon
uncertainty
she
was
sure
the
camber
of
her
decks
the
long
clean
sheer
of
her
hull
the
concave
flare
of
her
bows
what
was
the
amazing
joy
and
rightness
of
these
things
and
yet
the
grotesque
passengers
regarded
her
only
as
a
vehicle
to
carry
them
sedatively
to
some
clamouring
dock
fools
she
was
more
lovely
than
anything
they
would
ever
see
again
he
yearned
to
drive
her
endlessly
toward
that
unreachable
perimeter
of
sky
on
land
there
had
been
definite
horizons
even
if
disappointing
when
reached
and
examined
but
here
there
was
no
horizon
at
all
every
hour
it
slid
and
slid
over
the
dark
orb
of
sea
he
lost
count
of
time
the
tremulous
cradling
of
the
pomerania
steadily
climbing
the
long
leagues
her
noble
forecastle
solemnly
lifting
against
heaven
then
descending
with
grave
beauty
into
a
spread
of
foaming
beryl
and
snowdrift
seemed
one
with
the
rhythm
of
his
pulse
and
heart
perhaps
there
had
been
more
than
mere
ingenuity
in
his
last
riddle
for
the
theological
skipper
truly
the
subconscious
had
usurped
him
here
he
was
almost
happy
for
he
was
almost
unaware
of
life
it
was
all
blue
vacancy
and
suspension
the
sea
is
the
great
answer
and
consoler
for
it
means
either
nothing
or
everything
and
so
need
not
tease
the
brain
but
the
passengers
though
unobservant
began
to
murmur
especially
those
who
had
wagered
that
the
pomerania
would
dock
on
the
eighth
day
the
world
itself
they
complained
was
created
in
seven
days
and
why
should
so
fine
a
ship
take
longer
to
cross
a
comparatively
small
ocean
urbanely
over
coffee
and
petite
fours
gissing
argued
with
them
they
were
well
on
their
way
he
protested
and
then
as
a
hypothetical
case
he
asked
why
one
destination
was
more
worth
visiting
than
another
he
even
quoted
shakespeare
on
this
point
something
about
ports
and
happy
havens
and
succeeded
in
turning
the
tide
of
conversation
for
a
while
the
mention
of
shakespeare
suggested
to
some
of
the
ladies
that
it
would
be
pleasant
now
they
all
knew
each
other
so
well
to
put
on
some
amateur
theatricals
they
compromised
by
playing
charades
in
the
saloon
another
evening
gissing
kept
them
amused
by
fireworks
which
were
very
lovely
against
the
dark
sky
for
this
purpose
he
used
the
emergency
rockets
and
coloured
flares
much
to
the
distress
of
dane
the
quartermaster
who
had
charge
of
these
supplies
little
by
little
however
the
querulous
protests
of
the
passengers
began
to
weary
him
also
he
had
been
receiving
terse
memoranda
from
the
chief
engineer
that
the
coal
was
getting
low
in
the
bunkers
and
that
something
must
be
queer
in
the
navigating
department
this
seemed
very
unreasonable
the
fixed
gaze
of
pointer
perpetually
examining
the
horizon
as
though
he
wanted
to
make
sure
he
would
recognize
it
if
they
met
again
was
trying
even
captain
scottie
complained
one
day
that
the
supply
of
fresh
meat
had
given
out
and
that
the
steward
had
been
bringing
him
tinned
beef
gissing
determined
upon
resolute
measures
he
had
notice
served
that
on
account
of
possible
danger
from
pirates
there
would
be
a
general
boat
drill
on
the
following
day
not
merely
for
the
crew
but
for
everyone
he
gave
a
little
talk
about
it
in
the
saloon
after
dinner
and
worked
his
audience
up
to
quite
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
this
would
be
better
than
any
amateur
theatricals
he
insisted
everyone
was
to
act
exactly
as
though
in
a
sudden
calamity
they
might
make
up
the
on
the
basis
of
congeniality
if
they
wished
five
minutes
would
be
given
for
reaching
the
stations
without
panic
or
disorder
they
should
prepare
themselves
as
though
they
were
actually
going
to
leave
a
sinking
ship
the
passengers
were
delighted
with
the
idea
of
this
novel
entertainment
every
soul
on
board
with
the
exception
of
captain
scottie
who
had
locked
himself
in
and
refused
to
be
disturbed
was
properly
advertised
of
the
event

following

began
to

the

dropped
aft
amid
a
loud
miscellaneous
outcry

already
examining
the

he
slid
the

to
slow
half
and
then
full
once
more
the
ship
creamed
through
the
lifting
purple
swells
the
little
flock
of
boats
was
soon
out
of
sight
alone
at
the
wheel
he
realized
that
a
great
weight
was
off
his
mind
the
responsibility
of
his
position
had
burdened
him
more
than
he
knew
now
a
strange
eagerness
and
joy
possessed
him
his
bubbling
wake
cut
straight
and
milky
across
the
glittering
afternoon
in
a
ruddy
sunset
glow
the
sea
darkened
through
all
tints
of
violet
amethyst
indigo
the
horizon
line
sharpened
so
clearly
that
he
could
distinguish
the
tossing
profile
of
waves
wetting
the
sky
a
red
sky
at
night
is
the
sailor
delight
he
said
to
himself
he
switched
on
the
port
and
starboard
lights
and
the
masthead
lanterns
then
lashed
the
wheel
while
he
went
below
for
supper
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
he
was
for
he
seemed
to
have
steamed
clean
off
the
chart
but
as
he
conned
the
helm
that
evening
and
leaned
over
the
lighted
binnacle
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
not
far
from
some
destiny
with
cheerful
assurance
he
lashed
the
wheel
again
and
turned
in
he
woke
once
in
the
night
and
leaped
from
the
hammock
with
a
start
he
thought
he
had
heard
a
sound
of
barking
chapter
sixteen
the
next
morning
he
sighted
land
coming
out
on
the
bridge
the
whole
face
of
things
was
changed
the
had
lightened
to
a
tawny
green
gulls
dipped
and
hovered
away
on
the
horizon
lay
a
soft
blue
contour
land
ho
he
shouted
superbly
and
wondered
what
new
country
he
had
discovered
he
ran
up
a
hoist
of
red
and
yellow
signal
flags
and
steered
gaily
toward
the
shore
it
had
grown
suddenly
cold
he
had
to
fetch
captain
scottie
to
wear
at
the
wheel
on
the
long
spilling
crests
that
crumbled
and
spread
running
layers
of
froth
in
their
hurry
shoreward
the
pomerania
rode
home
she
knew
her
landfall
and
seemed
to
quicken
steadily
swinging
on
the
surges
she
buried
her
nose
almost
to
the
then
lifted
until
her
streaming
forefoot
gleamed
out
of
a
frilled
ruffle
of
foam
gissing
too
was
eager
a
tingling
buoyancy
and
impatience
took
hold
of
him
he
fidgeted
with
sheer
eagerness
for
life
land
the
beloved
stability
of
our
dear
and
only
earth
drew
and
charmed
him
behind
was
the
senseless
heartbreaking
sea
now
he
could
discern
hills
rising
in
a
gilded
opaline
light
in
the
volatile
thin
air
was
a
quick
sense
of
strangeness
a
new
world
was
close
about
him
a
world
that
he
could
see
and
feel
and
inhale
and
yet
knew
nothing
of
suddenly
a
great
humility
possessed
him
he
had
been
froward
and
silly
and
vain
he
had
shouted
arrogantly
at
beauty
like
a
noisy
tourist
in
a
canyon
and
the
only
answer
after
long
waiting
had
been
the
paltry
diminished
echo
of
his
own
voice
he
thought
shamefully
of
his
follies
what
matter
how
you
name
god
or
in
what
words
you
praise
him
in
this
new
foreign
land
he
would
quietly
accept
things
as
he
found
them
the
laughter
of
god
was
too
strange
to
understand
no
there
was
no
answer
he
was
doubly
damned
for
he
had
made
truth
a
mere
sport
of
intellectual
riddling
the
mind
like
a
spinning
flywheel
of
fatigued
steel
was
gradually
racked
to
bursting
by
the
conflict
of
stresses
and
yet
every
equilibrium
was
an
opposure
of
forces
rotation
if
swift
enough
creates
amazing
stability
he
had
seen
how
the
gyroscope
can
balance
at
apparently
impossible
angles
perhaps
it
was
so
of
the
mind
if
it
twirls
at
high
speed
it
can
lean
right
out
over
the
abyss
without
collapse
but
the
stationary
mind
he
thought
of
bishop
borzoi
must
keep
away
from
the
edge
try
to
force
it
to
the
edge
it
raves
in
panic
every
mind
very
likely
knows
its
own
frailties
and
does
well
to
safeguard
them
at
any
rate
that
was
the
most
generous
interpretation
most
minds
undoubtedly
were
uneasy
in
high
places
they
doubted
their
ability
to
refrain
from
jumping
off
how
many
bones
of
fine
intellects
lay
whitening
at
the
foot
of
the
theological
cliff
it
seemed
to
be
a
lonely
coast
and
wintry
patches
of
snow
lay
upon
the
hills
the
woods
were
bare
and
brown
a
harbour
opened
out
before
him
he
reduced
the
engines
to
dead
slow
and
glided
gaily
through
the
strait
he
had
been
anxious
lest
his
navigation
might
not
be
equal
to
the
occasion
he
did
not
want
to
disgrace
himself
at
this
final
test
but
all
seemed
to
arrange
itself
with
enchanted
ease
a
steep
ledge
of
ground
offered
a
natural
pier
with
for
bollards
he
let
her
come
gently
beyond
the
spot
reversed
the
propellers
just
at
the
right
time
and
backed
neatly
alongside
he
moved
the
telegraph
handle
to
finished
with
engines
ran
out
the
gangplank
smartly
and
stepped
ashore
he
moored
the
vessel
fore
and
aft
and
hung
out
fenders
to
prevent
chafing
the
first
thing
to
do
he
said
to
himself
is
to
get
the
lie
of
the
land
and
find
out
whether
it
is
inhabited
a
hillside
rising
above
the
water
promised
a
clear
view
the
stubble
grass
was
dry
and
frosty
after
the
warm
days
at
sea
the
chill
was
nipping
but
what
an
elixir
of
air
if
this
is
a
desert
island
he
thought
it
will
be
a
glorious
discovery
his
heart
was
jocund
with
anticipation
a
curious
foreign
look
in
the
landscape
he
thought
quite
unlike
anything
suddenly
where
the
hill
arched
against
pearly
sky
he
saw
narrow
thread
of
smoke
rising
he
halted
in
alarm
who
might
this
be
friend
or
foe
but
eager
agitation
pushed
him
on
burning
to
know
he
hurried
up
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
smoke
mounted
from
a
small
bonfire
of
sticks
in
a
sheltered
thicket
where
a
miraculous
being
who
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
rather
ragged
and
dingy
vagabond
was
cooking
a
tin
of
stew
over
the
blaze
gissing
stood
quivering
with
emotion
joy
such
as
he
had
never
known
darted
through
all
the
cords
of
his
body
he
ran
shouting
in
mirth
and
terror
in
fear
in
a
passion
of
love
and
knowledge
and
understanding
he
abased
himself
and
yearned
before
this
marvel
impossible
to
have
conceived
yet
once
seen
utterly
satisfying
and
the
fulfilment
of
all
needs
he
laughed
and
leaped
and
worshipped
when
the
first
transport
was
over
he
laid
his
head
against
this
being
knee
he
nestled
there
and
was
content
this
was
the
inscrutable
perfect
answer
cripes
said
the
puzzled
tramp
as
he
caressed
the
nuzzling
head
the
purp
loco
maybe
he
been
lost
you
might
think
he
never
seen
a
man
he
was
right
and
gissing
sat
quietly
his
throat
resting
upon
the
soiled
knee
of
a
very
old
and
spicy
trouser
i
have
found
god
he
said
presently
he
thought
of
the
ship
it
would
not
do
to
leave
her
so
insecurely
moored
reluctantly
with
many
a
backward
glance
and
a
heart
full
of
glory
he
left
the
presence
he
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
to
look
down
upon
the
harbour
the
outlook
was
puzzlingly
altered
he
gazed
in
astonishment
what
were
those
poplars
rising
naked
into
the
bright
air
there
was
something
familiar
about
them
and
that
little
house
beyond
he
stared
bewildered
the
great
shining
breadth
of
the
ocean
had
shrunk
to
the
roundness
of
a
tiny
pond
and
the
pomerania
he
leaned
over
shaken
with
questions
there
beside
the
bank
was
a
little
plank
of
wood
a
child
plaything
roughly
fashioned
shipshape
two
chips
for
funnels
red
and
yellow
frosted
leaves
for
flags
a
withered
dogwood
blossom
for
propeller
he
leaned
closer
with
whirling
mind
in
the
clear
cool
surface
of
the
pond
he
could
see
the
sky
mirrored
deeper
than
any
ocean
pellucid
infinite
blue
he
ran
up
the
path
to
the
house
the
scuffled
ragged
garden
lay
naked
and
hard
at
the
windows
he
saw
with
surprise
were
holly
wreaths
tied
with
broad
red
ribbon
on
the
porch
some
battered
toys
he
opened
the
door
a
fluttering
rosy
light
filled
the
room
by
the
fireplace
the
puppies
how
big
they
were
were
sitting
with
spaniel
joyous
uproar
greeted
him
they
flung
themselves
upon
him
shouts
of
daddy
daddy
filled
the
house
while
the
young
spaniels
stood
by
more
bashfully
good
spaniel
was
gratefully
moved
her
moist
eyes
shone
brightly
in
the
firelight
i
knew
you
be
home
for
christmas
gissing
she
said
i
been
telling
them
so
all
afternoon
now
children
be
still
a
moment
and
let
me
speak
i
been
telling
you
your
daddy
would
be
home
in
time
for
a
christmas
eve
story
i
got
to
go
and
fix
that
plum
in
her
excitement
a
clear
bubble
dripped
from
the
tip
of
her
tongue
she
caught
it
in
her
apron
and
hurried
to
the
kitchen
chapter
seventeen
the
children
insisted
on
leading
him
all
through
the
house
to
show
how
nicely
they
had
taken
care
of
things
and
in
every
room
gissing
saw
the
marks
of
riot
and
wreckage
there
were
on
all
the
fringes
of
rugs
were
chewed
off
there
were
prints
of
mud
ink
paints
and
whatnot
on
curtains
and
wallpapers
and
coverlets
poor
spaniel
kept
running
anxiously
from
the
kitchen
to
renew
apologies
i
did
try
to
keep
in
order
she
said
but
they
seem
to
bash
things
when
you
not
but
gissing
was
too
happy
to
stew
about
such
trifles
when
the
inspection
was
over
they
all
sat
down
by
the
chimney
and
he
piled
on
more
logs
well
chilluns
he
said
what
do
you
want
santa
claus
to
bring
you
for
christmas
an
aunbile
exclaimed
groups
an
elphunt
exclaimed
bunks
a
little
train
with
hammers
exclaimed
yelpers
a
little
train
with
hammers
asked
gissing
what
does
he
mean
oh
said
groups
and
bunks
with
condescending
pity
he
means
a
typewriter
he
calls
it
a
little
train
because
it
moves
on
a
track
when
you
hit
a
painful
apprehension
seized
him
and
he
went
hastily
to
his
study
he
had
not
noticed
the
typewriter
which
spaniel
had
too
late
put
out
of
reach
half
the
keys
were
sticking
upright
jammed
together
and
tangled
in
a
whirl
of
ribbon
the
carriage
was
strangely
dislocated
and
yet
even
this
mischance
which
would
once
have
horrified
him
left
him
unperturbed
it
my
own
fault
he
thought
i
should
have
left
it
where
they
could
play
with
it
perhaps
god
thinks
the
same
when
his
creatures
make
a
mess
of
the
dangerous
laws
of
life
a
christmas
story
the
children
were
clamouring
can
it
really
be
christmas
eve
gissing
thought
christmas
seems
to
have
come
very
suddenly
this
year
i
have
really
adjusted
my
mind
to
it
yet
all
right
he
said
now
sit
still
and
keep
quiet
bunks
give
yelpers
a
little
more
room
if
there
any
bickering
santa
claus
might
hear
he
sat
in
the
big
chair
by
the
fire
and
the
three
looked
upward
expectantly
from
the
hearthrug
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
little
puppies
who
lived
in
a
house
in
the
country
in
the
canine
estates
and
their
names
were
groups
bunks
and
the
three
tails
thumped
in
turn
as
the
names
were
mentioned
but
the
children
were
too
excitedly
absorbed
to
interrupt
and
one
year
just
before
christmas
they
heard
a
dreadful
what
a
rumour
cried
yelpers
alarmed
this
was
rather
difficult
to
explain
so
gissing
did
not
attempt
it
he
began
again
they
heard
that
santa
claus
might
not
be
able
to
come
because
he
was
so
behind
with
his
housework
you
see
santa
claus
is
a
great
big
newfoundland
dog
with
a
white
beard
and
he
lives
in
a
frosty
kennel
at
the
north
pole
all
shining
with
icicles
round
the
roof
and
windows
but
it
so
far
away
from
everywhere
that
poor
santa
could
get
a
servant
all
the
maids
who
went
there
refused
to
stay
because
it
was
so
cold
and
lonely
and
so
far
from
the
movies
santa
claus
was
busy
in
his
workshop
making
toys
he
was
busy
taking
care
of
the
reindeer
in
their
and
he
did
have
time
to
wash
his
dishes
so
all
summer
he
just
let
them
pile
up
and
pile
up
in
the
kitchen
and
when
christmas
came
near
there
was
his
lovely
house
in
a
dreadful
state
of
untidiness
he
could
go
away
and
leave
it
like
that
and
so
if
he
did
get
his
dishes
washed
and
the
house
cleaned
up
for
christmas
all
the
puppies
all
over
the
world
would
have
to
go
without
toys
when
groups
and
bunks
and
yelpers
heard
this
they
were
very
much
how
did
they
hear
it
asked
bunks
who
was
the
analytical
member
of
the
trio
a
very
sensible
question
said
gissing
approvingly
they
heard
it
from
the
chipmunk
who
lives
in
the
wood
behind
the
house
the
chipmunk
heard
it
in
his
chipmonastery
cried
groups
it
was
a
family
joke
to
call
the
chipmunk
burrow
by
that
name
and
though
the
puppies
did
not
understand
the
pun
they
relished
the
long
word
yes
continued
gissing
the
reindeer
in
santa
claus
stable
were
so
unhappy
about
the
dishes
not
being
washed
and
the
chance
of
missing
their
christmas
frolic
that
they
broadcasted
a
radio
message
their
horns
are
very
fine
for
sending
radio
and
the
chipmunk
sitting
at
his
little
wireless
outfit
with
the
receivers
over
his
ears
heard
it
and
chippy
told
groups
and
bunks
and
yelpers
so
these
puppies
decided
to
help
santa
claus
they
did
know
exactly
where
to
find
him
but
the
chipmunk
told
them
the
direction
and
off
they
went
they
travelled
and
travelled
and
when
they
came
to
the
ocean
they
begged
a
ride
from
the
seagulls
and
each
one
sat
on
a
back
just
as
though
he
was
on
a
little
airplane
they
flew
and
flew
and
at
last
they
came
to
santa
claus
house
through
the
which
were
made
of
clear
ice
they
could
see
the
reindeer
stamping
in
their
stalls
in
the
big
workshop
where
santa
claus
was
busy
making
toys
they
could
hear
a
lively
sound
of
hammering
the
big
red
sleigh
was
standing
outside
the
stables
all
ready
to
be
hitched
up
to
the
reindeer
they
slipped
into
santa
claus
house
quickly
and
quietly
so
no
one
would
see
or
hear
them
the
house
was
in
a
terrible
state
but
they
set
to
work
to
clean
up
groups
found
the
vacuum
cleaner
and
sucked
up
all
the
crumbs
from
the
rug
bunks
ran
upstairs
and
made
santa
claus
bed
for
him
and
swept
the
floors
and
put
clean
towels
in
the
bathroom
and
yelpers
hurried
into
the
kitchen
and
washed
the
dishes
and
scrubbed
the
pots
and
polished
the
off
the
silver
spoons
and
emptied
the
pan
all
working
hard
they
got
through
very
soon
and
made
santa
claus
house
as
clean
as
any
house
could
be
they
fixed
the
so
that
they
would
all
hang
level
not
just
anyhow
as
poor
santa
had
them
then
when
everything
was
spick
and
span
they
ran
outdoors
again
and
beckoned
the
seagulls
they
climbed
on
the
gulls
backs
and
away
they
flew
was
santa
claus
pleased
asked
bunks
indeed
he
was
when
he
came
back
from
his
workshop
very
tired
after
making
toys
all
what
kind
of
toys
did
he
make
exclaimed
yelpers
anxiously
did
he
make
a
typewriter
he
made
every
kind
of
toy
and
when
he
saw
how
his
house
had
been
cleaned
up
he
thought
the
fairies
must
have
done
it
he
lit
his
pipe
and
filled
a
thermos
bottle
with
hot
cocoa
to
keep
him
warm
on
his
long
journey
then
he
put
on
his
red
coat
and
his
long
boots
and
his
fur
cap
and
went
out
to
harness
the
reindeer
that
very
night
he
drove
off
with
his
sleigh
packed
full
of
toys
for
all
the
puppies
in
the
world
in
fact
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
loaded
his
big
bag
with
more
toys
than
he
had
ever
carried
before
and
that
was
how
a
queer
thing
they
waited
in
eager
suspense
you
know
santa
claus
always
drives
into
the
canine
estates
by
the
little
back
road
through
the
woods
where
the
chipmunk
lives
you
know
the
gateway
at
the
bend
in
the
lane
well
it
rather
narrow
and
santa
claus
sleigh
is
very
wide
and
this
time
because
his
bag
had
so
many
toys
in
it
the
bag
bulged
over
the
edge
of
the
sleigh
and
one
corner
of
the
bag
caught
on
the
gatepost
as
he
drove
by
three
toys
fell
out
and
what
do
you
suppose
they
were
an
aunbile
an
elphunt
a
typewriter
yes
that
quite
right
and
it
happened
that
the
chipmunk
was
out
that
night
digging
up
some
nuts
for
his
christmas
dinner
a
little
sad
because
he
had
no
presents
to
give
his
children
and
he
found
the
three
toys
he
took
them
home
to
the
little
chipmunks
and
they
were
tremendously
pleased
that
was
only
fair
because
if
it
had
been
for
the
chipmunk
and
his
radio
set
no
one
would
have
had
any
toys
that
did
santa
claus
have
any
more
typewriters
in
his
bag
asked
yelpers
gravely
oh
yes
he
had
plenty
more
of
everything
and
when
he
got
to
the
house
where
groups
and
bunks
and
yelpers
lived
he
slid
down
the
chimney
and
took
a
look
round
he
did
see
any
crumbs
on
the
floor
or
any
toys
lying
about
not
put
away
so
he
filled
the
stockings
with
all
kinds
of
lovely
things
and
an
aunbile
and
an
elphunt
and
a
what
did
the
puppies
say
they
inquired
they
were
sound
asleep
upstairs
and
did
know
anything
about
it
until
christmas
morning
come
on
now
it
time
for
we
can
undress
ourselves
now
said
groups
will
you
tuck
me
in
said
bunks
you
sure
he
had
another
typewriter
in
his
bag
said
yelpers
they
scrambled
upstairs
later
when
the
house
was
quiet
gissing
went
out
to
the
kitchen
to
see
spaniel
she
was
diligently
rolling
pastry
and
her
nose
was
white
with
flour
oh
sir
i
glad
you
got
home
in
time
for
christmas
she
said
the
children
were
counting
on
it
did
you
have
a
successful
trip
sir
every
trip
is
successful
when
you
get
home
again
said
gissing
i
suppose
the
shops
will
be
open
late
wo
they
i
going
to
run
down
to
the
village
to
get
some
before
leaving
the
house
he
went
down
to
the
cellar
to
see
if
the
furnace
was
all
right
he
was
amazed
to
see
how
naturally
and
cheerfully
he
had
slipped
back
into
the
old
sense
of
responsibility
where
was
the
illusory
freedom
he
had
dreamed
of
even
the
epiphany
on
the
hilltop
now
seemed
a
distant
miracle
that
fearful
happiness
might
never
come
again
and
yet
here
among
the
familiar
difficult
minutiae
of
home
what
a
lightness
he
felt
a
great
phrase
from
the
came
to
his
mind
whose
service
is
perfect
ah
he
said
to
himself
it
is
all
very
well
to
wear
a
crown
of
thorns
and
indeed
every
sensitive
creature
carries
one
in
secret
but
there
are
times
when
it
ought
to
be
worn
cocked
over
one
ear
he
opened
the
furnace
door
a
bright
glow
filled
the
he
could
hear
a
stir
and
singing
in
the
boiler
and
the
rustle
of
warm
pipes
that
chuckled
quietly
through
winter
nights
of
storm
over
the
coals
hovered
a
magic
evasive
flicker
the
very
soul
of
fire
it
was
a
pentecostal
flame
perfect
and
heavenly
in
tint
the
essence
of
pure
colour
a
clear
immortal
blue
the
end
