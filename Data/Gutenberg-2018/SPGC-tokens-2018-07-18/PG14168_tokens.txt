the

one
i
the
three
or
four
to
let
boards
had
stood
within
the
low
paling
as
long
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
triangular
square
could
remember
and
if
they
had
ever
been
vertical
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
they
now
overhung
the
palings
each
at
its
own
angle
and
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
row
of
wooden
choppers
ever
in
the
act
of
falling
upon
some
yet
never
cutting
off
a
tenant
for
the
old
house
from
the
stream
of
his
fellows
not
that
there
was
ever
any
great
stream
through
the
square
the
stream
passed
a
furlong
and
more
away
beyond
the
intricacy
of
tenements
and
alleys
and
byways
that
had
sprung
up
since
the
old
house
had
been
built
hemming
it
in
completely
and
probably
the
house
itself
was
only
suffered
to
stand
pending
the
of
a
lease
or
two
when
doubtless
a
clearance
would
be
made
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
it
was
of
bloomy
old
red
brick
and
built
into
its
walls
were
the
crowns
and
clasped
hands
and
other
insignia
of
insurance
companies
long
since
defunct
the
children
of
the
secluded
square
had
swung
upon
the
low
gate
at
the
end
of
the
until
little
more
than
the
solid
top
bar
of
it
remained
and
the
alley
itself
ran
past
boarded
basement
windows
on
which
tramps
had
chalked
their
cryptic
marks
the
path
was
washed
and
worn
uneven
by
the
spilling
of
water
from
the
eaves
of
the
encroaching
next
house
and
cats
and
dogs
had
made
the
approach
their
own
the
chances
of
a
tenant
did
not
seem
such
as
to
warrant
the
keeping
of
the
to
let
boards
in
a
state
of
legibility
and
repair
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
so
kept
for
six
months
oleron
had
passed
the
old
place
twice
a
day
or
oftener
on
his
way
from
his
lodgings
to
the
room
ten
minutes
walk
away
he
had
taken
to
work
in
and
for
six
months
no
had
fallen
across
his
path
this
might
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
he
usually
took
the
other
side
of
the
square
but
he
chanced
one
morning
to
take
the
side
that
ran
past
the
broken
gate
and
the
entrance
alley
and
to
pause
before
one
of
the
inclined
boards
the
board
bore
besides
the
agent
name
the
announcement
written
apparently
about
the
time
of
oleron
own
early
youth
that
the
key
was
to
be
had
at
number
six
now
oleron
was
already
paying
for
his
separate
bedroom
and
workroom
more
than
an
author
who
without
private
means
habitually
disregards
his
public
can
afford
and
he
was
paying
in
addition
a
small
rent
for
the
storage
of
the
greater
part
of
his
grandmother
furniture
moreover
it
invariably
happened
that
the
book
he
wished
to
read
in
bed
was
at
his
half
a
mile
and
more
away
while
the
note
or
letter
he
had
sudden
need
of
during
the
day
was
as
likely
as
not
to
be
in
the
pocket
of
another
coat
hanging
behind
his
bedroom
door
and
there
were
other
inconveniences
in
having
a
divided
domicile
therefore
oleron
brought
suddenly
up
by
the
looked
first
down
through
some
scanty
at
the
boarded
basement
windows
then
up
at
the
blank
and
grimy
windows
of
the
first
floor
and
so
up
to
the
second
floor
and
the
flat
stone
coping
of
the
leads
he
stood
for
a
minute
thumbing
his
lean
and
shaven
jaw
then
with
another
glance
at
the
board
he
walked
slowly
across
the
square
to
number
six
he
knocked
and
waited
for
two
or
three
minutes
but
although
the
door
stood
open
received
no
answer
he
was
knocking
again
when
a
man
in
appeared
i
was
arsking
a
blessing
on
our
food
he
said
in
severe
explanation
oleron
asked
if
he
might
have
the
key
of
the
old
house
and
the
man
withdrew
again
oleron
waited
for
another
five
minutes
on
the
step
then
the
man
appearing
again
and
masticating
some
of
the
food
of
which
he
had
spoken
announced
that
the
key
was
lost
but
you
wo
want
it
he
said
the
entrance
door
is
closed
and
a
push
open
any
of
the
others
i
a
agent
for
it
if
you
thinking
of
taking
it
oleron
recrossed
the
square
descended
the
two
steps
at
the
broken
gate
passed
along
the
alley
and
turned
in
at
the
old
wide
doorway
to
the
right
immediately
within
the
door
steps
descended
to
the
roomy
cellars
and
the
staircase
before
him
had
a
carved
rail
and
was
broad
and
handsome
and
filthy
oleron
ascended
it
avoiding
contact
with
the
rail
and
wall
and
stopped
at
the
first
landing
a
door
facing
him
had
been
boarded
up
but
he
pushed
at
that
on
his
right
hand
and
an
insecure
bolt
or
staple
yielded
he
entered
the
empty
first
floor
he
spent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
place
and
then
came
out
again
without
mounting
higher
he
descended
and
recrossed
the
square
to
the
house
of
the
man
who
had
lost
the
key
can
you
tell
me
how
much
the
rent
is
he
asked
the
man
mentioned
a
figure
the
comparative
lowness
of
which
seemed
accounted
for
by
the
character
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
abominable
state
of
unrepair
of
the
place
would
it
be
possible
to
rent
a
single
floor
the
man
did
not
know
they
might
who
are
they
the
man
gave
oleron
the
name
of
a
firm
of
lawyers
in
lincoln
inn
you
might
mention
my
name
barrett
he
added
pressure
of
work
prevented
oleron
from
going
down
to
lincoln
inn
that
afternoon
but
he
went
on
the
morrow
and
was
instantly
offered
the
whole
house
as
a
purchase
for
fifty
pounds
down
the
remainder
of
the
to
remain
on
mortgage
it
took
him
half
an
hour
to
disabuse
the
lawyer
mind
of
the
idea
that
he
wished
anything
more
of
the
place
than
to
rent
a
single
floor
of
it
this
made
certain
hums
and
haws
of
a
difference
and
the
lawyer
was
by
no
means
certain
that
it
lay
within
his
power
to
do
as
oleron
suggested
but
it
was
finally
extracted
from
him
that
provided
the
were
allowed
to
remain
up
and
that
provided
it
was
agreed
that
in
the
event
of
the
whole
house
letting
the
arrangement
should
terminate
automatically
without
further
notice
something
might
be
done
that
the
old
place
should
suddenly
let
over
his
head
seemed
to
oleron
the
slightest
of
risks
to
take
and
he
promised
a
decision
within
a
week
on
the
morrow
he
visited
the
house
again
went
through
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
then
went
home
to
his
lodgings
to
take
a
bath
he
was
immensely
taken
with
that
portion
of
the
house
he
had
already
determined
should
be
his
own
scraped
clean
and
repainted
and
with
that
old
furniture
of
oleron
grandmother
it
ought
to
be
entirely
charming
he
went
to
the
storage
warehouse
to
refresh
his
memory
of
his
belongings
and
to
take
measurements
and
thence
he
went
to
a
decorator
he
was
very
busy
with
his
regular
work
and
could
have
wished
that
the
had
caught
his
attention
either
a
few
months
earlier
or
else
later
in
the
year
but
the
quickest
way
would
be
to
suspend
work
entirely
until
after
his
removal
a
fortnight
later
his
first
floor
was
painted
throughout
in
a
tender
white
the
paint
was
dry
and
oleron
was
in
the
middle
of
his
installation
he
was
animated
delighted
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
as
he
polished
and
made
disposals
of
his
grandmother
effects
the
tall
china
cupboard
with
its
derby
and
mason
and
spode
the
large
folding
sheraton
table
the
long
low
bookshelves
he
had
had
two
of
them
copied
the
chairs
the
sheffield
candlesticks
the
riveted
these
things
he
set
against
his
newly
painted
walls
walls
of
wood
panelled
in
the
happiest
proportions
and
moulded
and
coffered
to
the
in
a
mood
of
gaiety
and
rest
that
the
builders
of
rooms
no
longer
know
the
ceilings
were
lofty
and
faintly
painted
with
an
old
pattern
of
stars
even
the
tapering
mouldings
of
his
iron
fireplace
were
as
delicately
designed
as
jewellery
and
oleron
walked
about
rubbing
his
hands
frequently
stopping
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
glimpses
from
white
room
to
white
room
charming
charming
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
what
elsie
bengough
will
think
of
this
he
bought
a
bolt
and
a
yale
lock
for
his
door
and
shut
off
his
quarters
from
the
rest
of
the
house
if
he
now
wanted
to
read
in
bed
his
book
could
be
had
for
stepping
into
the
next
room
all
the
time
he
thought
how
exceedingly
lucky
he
was
to
get
the
place
he
put
up
a
in
the
little
square
hall
and
hung
up
his
hats
and
caps
and
coats
and
passers
through
the
small
triangular
square
late
at
night
looking
up
over
the
little
serried
row
of
wooden
to
let
hatchets
could
see
the
light
within
oleron
red
blinds
or
else
the
sudden
darkening
of
one
blind
and
the
illumination
of
another
as
oleron
candlestick
in
hand
passed
from
room
to
room
making
final
settlings
of
his
furniture
or
preparing
to
resume
the
work
that
his
removal
had
interrupted
ii
as
far
as
the
chief
business
of
his
life
his
writing
was
concerned
paul
oleron
treated
the
world
a
good
deal
better
than
he
was
treated
by
it
but
he
seldom
took
the
trouble
to
strike
a
balance
or
to
compute
how
far
at
years
of
age
he
was
behind
his
points
on
the
handicap
to
have
done
so
would
have
altered
matters
and
it
might
have
depressed
oleron
he
had
chosen
his
path
and
was
committed
to
it
beyond
possibility
of
withdrawal
perhaps
he
had
chosen
it
in
the
days
when
he
had
been
easily
swayed
by
something
a
little
disinterested
a
little
generous
a
little
noble
and
had
he
ever
thought
of
questioning
himself
he
would
still
have
held
to
it
that
a
life
without
nobility
and
generosity
and
disinterestedness
was
no
life
for
him
only
quite
recently
and
rarely
had
he
even
vaguely
suspected
that
there
was
more
in
it
than
this
but
it
was
no
good
anticipating
the
day
when
he
supposed
he
would
reach
that
maximum
point
of
his
powers
beyond
which
he
must
inevitably
decline
and
be
left
face
to
face
with
the
question
whether
it
would
not
have
profited
him
better
to
have
ruled
his
life
by
less
exigent
ideals
in
the
meantime
his
removal
into
the
old
house
with
the
insurance
marks
built
into
its
brick
merely
interrupted
at
the
fifteenth
chapter
as
this
tall
man
with
the
lean
ascetic
face
moved
about
his
new
abode
arranging
changing
altering
hardly
yet
into
his
again
he
gave
the
impression
of
almost
precision
and
nicety
for
twenty
years
past
in
a
score
of
lodgings
garrets
flats
and
rooms
furnished
and
unfurnished
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
many
things
for
himself
and
he
had
discovered
that
it
saves
time
and
temper
to
be
methodical
he
had
arranged
with
the
wife
of
the
barrett
a
stout
welsh
woman
with
a
falsetto
voice
the
merionethshire
accent
of
which
long
residence
in
london
had
not
perceptibly
modified
to
come
across
the
square
each
morning
to
prepare
his
breakfast
and
also
to
turn
the
place
out
on
saturday
mornings
and
for
the
rest
he
even
welcomed
a
little
housework
as
a
relaxation
from
the
strain
of
writing
his
kitchen
together
with
the
adjoining
strip
of
an
apartment
into
which
a
modern
bath
had
been
fitted
overlooked
the
alley
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
at
one
end
of
it
was
a
large
closet
with
a
door
and
a
square
sliding
hatch
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
this
had
been
a
and
through
the
hatch
the
elaborately
dressed
head
had
been
thrust
to
receive
the
click
and
puff
of
the
oleron
puzzled
a
little
over
this
closet
then
as
its
use
occurred
to
him
he
smiled
faintly
a
little
moved
he
knew
not
by
what
he
would
have
to
put
it
to
a
very
different
purpose
from
its
original
one
it
would
probably
have
to
serve
as
his
larder
it
was
in
this
closet
that
he
made
a
discovery
the
back
of
it
was
shelved
and
rummaging
on
an
upper
shelf
that
ran
deeply
into
the
wall
oleron
found
a
couple
of
old
wooden
he
did
not
know
how
they
had
come
to
be
there
doubtless
the
painters
had
turned
them
up
somewhere
or
other
and
had
put
them
there
but
his
five
rooms
as
a
whole
were
short
of
cupboard
and
and
it
was
only
by
the
exercise
of
some
ingenuity
that
he
was
able
to
find
places
for
the
bestowal
of
his
household
linen
his
boxes
and
his
but
accumulations
of
papers
it
was
in
early
spring
that
oleron
entered
on
his
tenancy
and
he
was
anxious
to
have
ready
for
publication
in
the
coming
autumn
nevertheless
he
did
not
intend
to
force
its
production
should
it
demand
longer
in
the
doing
so
much
the
worse
he
realised
its
importance
its
crucial
importance
in
his
artistic
development
and
it
must
have
its
own
length
and
time
in
the
workroom
he
had
recently
left
he
had
been
making
excellent
progress
had
begun
as
the
saying
is
to
speak
and
act
of
herself
and
he
did
not
doubt
she
would
continue
to
do
so
the
moment
the
distraction
of
his
removal
was
over
this
distraction
was
almost
over
he
told
himself
it
was
time
he
pulled
himself
together
again
and
on
a
march
morning
he
went
out
returned
again
with
two
great
bunches
of
yellow
daffodils
placed
one
bunch
on
his
mantelpiece
between
the
sheffield
sticks
and
the
other
on
the
table
before
him
and
took
out
the
manuscript
of
but
before
beginning
work
he
went
to
a
small
rosewood
cabinet
and
took
from
a
drawer
his
and
he
totted
them
up
and
his
face
grew
thoughtful
his
installation
had
cost
him
more
than
he
had
intended
it
should
and
his
balance
was
rather
less
than
fifty
pounds
with
no
immediate
prospect
of
more
hm
i
forgotten
rugs
and
chintz
curtains
and
so
forth
mounted
up
so
said
oleron
but
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
spoil
the
place
for
the
want
of
ten
pounds
or
so
well
simply
be
out
for
the
autumn
that
all
so
here
goes
he
drew
his
papers
towards
him
but
he
worked
badly
or
rather
he
did
not
work
at
all
the
square
outside
had
its
own
noises
frequent
and
new
and
oleron
could
only
hope
that
he
would
speedily
become
accustomed
to
these
first
came
hawkers
with
their
carts
and
cries
at
midday
the
children
returning
from
school
trooped
into
the
square
and
swung
on
oleron
gate
and
when
the
children
had
departed
again
for
afternoon
school
an
itinerant
musician
with
a
mandolin
posted
himself
beneath
oleron
window
and
began
to
strum
this
was
a
not
unpleasant
distraction
and
oleron
pushing
up
his
window
threw
the
man
a
penny
then
he
returned
to
his
table
again
but
it
was
no
good
he
came
to
himself
at
long
intervals
to
find
that
he
had
been
looking
about
his
room
and
wondering
how
it
had
formerly
been
furnished
whether
a
settee
in
buttercup
or
petunia
satin
had
stood
under
the
farther
window
whether
from
the
centre
moulding
of
the
light
lofty
ceiling
had
depended
a
glimmering
crystal
chandelier
or
where
the
or
the
had
stood
no
it
was
no
good
he
had
far
better
be
frankly
doing
nothing
than
getting
fruitlessly
tired
and
he
decided
that
he
would
take
a
walk
but
chancing
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
dozed
in
his
chair
instead
this
wo
do
he
yawned
when
he
awoke
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
must
do
better
than
this
and
he
felt
so
deliciously
lazy
that
for
some
minutes
he
even
contemplated
the
breach
of
an
appointment
he
had
for
the
evening
the
next
morning
he
sat
down
to
work
without
even
permitting
himself
to
answer
one
of
his
three
letters
two
of
them
tradesmen
accounts
the
third
a
note
from
miss
bengough
forwarded
from
his
old
address
it
was
a
jolly
day
of
white
and
blue
with
a
gay
noisy
wind
and
a
subtle
turn
in
the
colour
of
growing
things
and
over
and
over
again
once
or
twice
a
minute
his
room
became
suddenly
light
and
then
subdued
again
as
the
shining
white
clouds
rolled
over
the
square
the
soft
fitful
illumination
was
reflected
in
the
polished
surface
of
the
table
and
even
in
the
footworn
old
floor
and
the
morning
noises
had
begun
again
oleron
made
a
pattern
of
dots
on
the
paper
before
him
and
then
broke
off
to
move
the
jar
of
daffodils
exactly
opposite
the
centre
of
a
creamy
panel
then
he
wrote
a
sentence
that
ran
continuously
for
a
couple
of
lines
after
which
it
broke
on
into
notes
and
jottings
for
a
time
he
succeeded
in
persuading
himself
that
in
making
these
memoranda
he
was
really
working
then
he
rose
and
began
to
pace
his
room
as
he
did
so
he
was
struck
by
an
idea
it
was
that
the
place
might
possibly
be
a
little
better
for
more
positive
colour
it
was
perhaps
a
thought
pale
mild
and
sweet
as
a
kind
old
face
but
a
little
devitalised
even
wan
yes
decidedly
it
would
bear
a
robuster
note
more
and
richer
flowers
and
possibly
some
warm
and
gay
stuff
for
cushions
for
the
of
course
i
really
ca
afford
it
he
muttered
as
he
went
for
a
and
began
to
measure
the
width
of
the
window
recesses
in
stooping
to
measure
a
recess
his
attitude
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
interest
and
attention
presently
he
rose
again
rubbing
his
hands
with
gentle
glee
oho
oho
he
said
these
look
to
me
very
much
like
nailed
up
we
must
look
into
this
yes
those
are
boxes
or
i
oho
this
is
an
adventure
on
that
wall
of
his
there
were
two
windows
the
third
was
in
another
corner
and
beyond
the
open
bedroom
door
on
the
same
wall
was
another
the
seats
of
all
had
been
painted
repainted
and
painted
again
and
oleron
investigating
finger
had
barely
detected
the
old
nailheads
beneath
the
paint
under
the
ledge
over
which
he
stooped
an
old
keyhole
also
had
been
puttied
up
oleron
took
out
his
penknife
he
worked
carefully
for
five
minutes
and
then
went
into
the
kitchen
for
a
hammer
and
chisel
driving
the
chisel
cautiously
under
the
seat
he
started
the
whole
lid
slightly
again
using
the
penknife
he
cut
along
the
hinged
edge
and
outward
along
the
ends
and
then
he
fetched
a
wedge
and
a
wooden
mallet
now
for
our
little
mystery
he
said
the
sound
of
the
mallet
on
the
wedge
seemed
in
that
sweet
and
pale
apartment
somehow
a
little
brutal
nay
even
shocking
the
panelling
rang
and
rattled
and
vibrated
to
the
blows
like
a
the
whole
house
seemed
to
echo
from
the
roomy
cellarage
to
the
garrets
above
a
flock
of
echoes
seemed
to
awake
and
the
sound
got
a
little
on
oleron
nerves
all
at
once
he
paused
fetched
a
duster
and
muffled
the
mallet
when
the
edge
was
sufficiently
raised
he
put
his
fingers
under
it
and
lifted
the
paint
flaked
and
starred
a
little
the
rusty
old
nails
squeaked
and
grunted
and
the
lid
came
up
laying
open
the
box
beneath
oleron
looked
into
it
save
for
a
couple
of
inches
of
scurf
and
mould
and
old
cobwebs
it
was
empty
no
treasure
there
said
oleron
a
little
amused
that
he
should
have
fancied
there
might
have
been
will
still
have
to
be
out
by
the
autumn
let
have
a
look
at
the
others
he
turned
to
the
second
window
the
raising
of
the
two
remaining
seats
occupied
him
until
well
into
the
afternoon
that
of
the
bedroom
like
the
first
was
empty
but
from
the
second
seat
of
his
he
drew
out
something
yielding
and
folded
and
furred
over
an
inch
thick
with
dust
he
carried
the
object
into
the
kitchen
and
having
swept
it
over
a
bucket
took
a
duster
to
it
it
was
some
sort
of
a
large
bag
of
an
ancient
material
and
when
unfolded
it
occupied
the
greater
part
of
the
small
kitchen
floor
in
shape
it
was
an
irregular
a
very
irregular
triangle
and
it
had
a
couple
of
wide
flaps
with
the
remains
of
straps
and
buckles
the
patch
that
had
been
uppermost
in
the
folding
was
of
a
faded
yellowish
brown
but
the
rest
of
it
was
of
shades
of
crimson
that
varied
according
to
the
exposure
of
the
parts
of
it
now
whatever
can
that
have
been
oleron
mused
as
he
stood
surveying
it
i
give
it
up
whatever
it
is
it
settled
my
work
for
today
i
afraid
he
folded
the
object
up
carelessly
and
thrust
it
into
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
then
taking
pans
and
brushes
and
an
old
knife
he
returned
to
the
and
began
to
scrape
and
to
wash
and
to
line
with
paper
his
newly
discovered
receptacles
when
he
had
finished
he
put
his
spare
boots
and
books
and
papers
into
them
and
he
closed
the
lids
again
amused
with
his
little
adventure
but
also
a
little
anxious
for
the
hour
to
come
when
he
should
settle
fairly
down
to
his
work
again
iii
it
piqued
oleron
a
little
that
his
friend
miss
bengough
should
dismiss
with
a
glance
the
place
he
himself
had
found
so
singularly
winning
indeed
she
scarcely
lifted
her
eyes
to
it
but
then
she
had
always
been
more
or
less
like
that
a
little
indifferent
to
the
graces
of
life
careless
of
appearances
and
perhaps
a
shade
more
herself
when
she
ate
biscuits
from
a
paper
bag
than
when
she
dined
with
greater
observance
of
the
convenances
she
was
an
unattached
journalist
of
large
showy
fair
as
butter
pink
as
a
reminding
one
of
a
picked
specimen
bloom
and
given
to
sudden
and
ample
movements
and
moist
and
explosive
utterances
she
pulled
a
better
living
out
of
the
pool
as
she
expressed
it
than
oleron
did
and
by
cunningly
disguised
puffs
of
drapers
and
haberdashers
she
pulled
also
the
greater
part
of
her
very
varied
wardrobe
she
left
small
whirlwinds
of
air
behind
her
when
she
moved
in
which
her
veils
and
scarves
fluttered
and
spun
oleron
heard
the
flurry
of
her
skirts
on
his
staircase
and
her
single
loud
knock
at
his
door
when
he
had
been
a
month
in
his
new
abode
her
garments
brought
in
the
outer
air
and
she
flung
a
bundle
of
journals
down
on
a
chair
do
knock
off
for
me
she
said
across
a
mouthful
of
hatpins
as
she
removed
her
hat
and
veil
i
did
know
whether
you
were
straight
yet
so
i
brought
some
sandwiches
for
lunch
you
got
coffee
i
suppose
no
do
get
up
i
find
the
kitchen
oh
that
all
right
i
clear
these
things
away
to
tell
the
truth
i
rather
glad
to
be
interrupted
said
oleron
he
gathered
his
work
together
and
put
it
away
she
was
already
in
the
kitchen
he
heard
the
running
of
water
into
the
kettle
he
joined
her
and
ten
minutes
later
followed
her
back
to
the
with
the
coffee
and
sandwiches
on
a
tray
they
sat
down
with
the
tray
on
a
small
table
between
them
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
new
place
oleron
asked
as
she
poured
out
coffee
hm
anybody
think
you
were
going
to
get
married
paul
he
laughed
oh
no
but
it
an
improvement
on
some
of
them
is
it
is
it
i
suppose
it
is
i
do
know
i
liked
the
last
place
in
spite
of
the
black
ceiling
and
no
watertap
how
oleron
thumbed
his
chin
hm
i
rather
ashamed
to
tell
you
the
fact
is
i
not
got
on
very
well
with
it
but
it
will
be
all
right
on
the
night
as
you
used
to
say
stuck
rather
stuck
got
any
of
it
you
care
to
read
to
me
oleron
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
portions
of
his
work
to
miss
bengough
occasionally
her
comments
were
always
quick
and
practical
sometimes
directly
useful
sometimes
indirectly
suggestive
she
in
return
for
his
confidence
always
kept
all
mention
of
her
own
work
sedulously
from
him
his
she
said
was
real
work
hers
merely
filled
space
not
always
even
grammatically
i
afraid
there
is
oleron
replied
still
meditatively
his
chin
then
he
added
with
a
little
burst
of
candour
the
fact
is
elsie
i
not
written
not
actually
written
very
much
more
of
it
more
of
it
in
fact
but
of
course
that
does
mean
i
have
progressed
i
progressed
in
one
sense
rather
alarmingly
i
now
thinking
of
reconstructing
the
whole
thing
miss
bengough
gave
a
gasp
reconstructing
making
romilly
herself
a
different
type
of
woman
somehow
i
begun
to
feel
that
i
not
getting
the
most
out
of
her
as
she
stands
certainly
lost
interest
in
her
to
some
extent
but
but
miss
bengough
protested
you
had
her
so
real
so
paul
oleron
smiled
faintly
he
had
been
quite
prepared
for
miss
disapproval
he
was
surprised
that
she
liked
romilly
as
she
at
present
existed
she
would
whether
she
realised
it
or
not
there
was
much
of
herself
in
his
fictitious
creation
naturally
romilly
would
seem
real
living
to
her
but
are
you
really
serious
paul
miss
bengough
asked
presently
with
a
stare
quite
serious
you
really
going
to
scrap
those
fifteen
chapters
i
did
exactly
say
that
that
fine
rich
i
should
only
do
it
reluctantly
and
for
the
sake
of
something
i
thought
better
and
that
beautiful
description
of
romilly
on
the
shore
it
would
necessarily
be
wasted
he
said
a
little
uneasily
but
miss
bengough
made
a
large
and
windy
gesture
and
then
let
him
have
it
really
you
are
trying
she
broke
out
i
do
wish
sometimes
remember
you
human
and
live
in
a
world
you
know
i
be
the
to
wish
you
to
lower
your
standard
one
inch
but
it
would
be
lowering
it
to
bring
it
within
human
comprehension
oh
you
sometimes
altogether
too
godlike
why
it
would
be
a
wicked
criminal
waste
of
your
powers
to
destroy
those
fifteen
chapters
look
at
it
reasonably
now
been
working
for
nearly
twenty
years
you
now
got
what
you
been
working
for
almost
within
your
grasp
your
affairs
are
at
a
most
critical
stage
oh
do
tell
me
i
know
you
about
at
the
end
of
your
money
and
here
you
are
deliberately
proposing
to
withdraw
a
thing
that
will
probably
make
your
name
and
to
substitute
for
it
something
that
ten
to
one
nobody
on
earth
will
ever
want
to
read
and
small
blame
to
them
really
you
try
my
patience
oleron
had
shaken
his
head
slowly
as
she
had
talked
it
was
an
old
story
between
them
the
noisy
able
practical
journalist
was
an
admirable
friend
up
to
a
certain
point
beyond
that
well
each
of
us
knows
that
point
beyond
which
we
stand
alone
elsie
bengough
sometimes
said
that
had
she
had
part
of
oleron
genius
there
were
few
things
she
could
not
have
done
thus
making
that
genius
a
quantitatively
divisible
thing
a
sort
of
ingredient
to
be
added
to
or
subtracted
from
in
the
admixture
of
his
work
that
it
was
a
qualitative
thing
essential
indivisible
informing
passed
her
comprehension
their
spirits
parted
company
at
that
point
oleron
knew
it
she
did
not
appear
to
know
it
yes
yes
yes
he
said
a
little
wearily
practically
quite
right
entirely
right
and
i
have
a
word
to
say
if
i
could
only
turn
over
to
you
you
make
an
enormous
success
of
her
but
that
ca
be
and
i
for
my
part
am
seriously
doubting
whether
worth
my
while
you
know
what
that
means
what
does
it
mean
she
demanded
bluntly
well
he
said
smiling
wanly
what
it
mean
when
convinced
a
thing
is
worth
doing
you
simply
do
do
it
miss
bengough
eyes
swept
the
ceiling
for
assistance
against
this
impossible
man
what
utter
rubbish
she
broke
out
at
last
why
when
i
saw
you
last
you
were
simply
oozing
you
were
turning
her
off
at
the
rate
of
four
chapters
a
week
if
you
had
moved
you
have
had
her
done
by
now
what
on
earth
possessed
you
to
move
right
in
the
middle
of
your
most
important
work
oleron
tried
to
put
her
off
with
a
recital
of
inconveniences
but
she
would
have
it
perhaps
in
her
heart
she
partly
suspected
the
reason
he
was
simply
mortally
weary
of
the
narrow
circumstances
of
his
life
he
had
had
twenty
years
of
it
twenty
years
of
garrets
and
and
dingy
flats
and
shabby
lodgings
and
he
was
tired
of
dinginess
and
shabbiness
the
reward
was
as
far
off
as
ever
or
if
it
was
not
he
no
longer
cared
as
once
he
would
have
cared
to
put
out
his
hand
and
take
it
it
is
all
very
well
to
tell
a
man
who
is
at
the
point
of
exhaustion
that
only
another
effort
is
required
of
him
if
he
can
not
make
it
he
is
as
far
off
as
ever
anyway
oleron
summed
up
i
happier
here
than
i
been
for
a
long
time
that
some
sort
of
a
justification
and
doing
no
work
said
miss
bengough
pointedly
at
that
a
trifling
petulance
that
had
been
gathering
in
oleron
came
to
a
head
and
why
should
i
do
nothing
but
work
he
demanded
how
much
happier
am
i
for
it
i
do
say
i
do
love
my
work
when
it
done
but
i
hate
doing
it
sometimes
it
an
intolerable
burden
that
i
simply
long
to
be
rid
of
once
in
many
weeks
it
has
a
moment
one
moment
of
glow
and
thrill
for
me
i
remember
the
days
when
it
was
all
glow
and
thrill
and
now
i
and
it
becoming
drudgery
nobody
wants
it
ceasing
to
want
it
myself
and
if
any
ordinary
sensible
man
were
to
ask
me
whether
i
did
think
i
was
a
fool
to
go
on
i
think
i
should
agree
that
i
was
miss
bengough
comely
pink
face
was
serious
but
you
knew
all
that
many
many
years
ago
paul
and
still
you
chose
it
she
said
in
a
low
voice
well
and
how
should
i
have
known
he
demanded
i
did
know
i
was
told
so
my
heart
if
you
like
told
me
so
and
i
thought
i
knew
youth
always
thinks
it
knows
then
one
day
it
discovers
that
it
is
nearly
fifty
paul
then
and
it
finds
that
the
glamour
is
in
front
but
behind
yes
i
knew
and
chose
if
knowing
and
choosing
but
it
a
costly
choice
we
called
on
to
make
when
we
young
miss
bengough
eyes
were
on
the
floor
without
moving
them
she
said
you
not
regretting
it
paul
am
i
not
he
took
her
up
upon
my
word
i
lately
thought
i
am
what
i
get
in
return
for
it
all
you
know
what
you
get
she
replied
he
might
have
known
from
her
tone
what
else
he
could
have
had
for
the
holding
up
of
a
finger
herself
she
knew
but
could
not
tell
him
that
he
could
have
done
no
better
thing
for
himself
had
he
any
time
these
ten
years
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
would
have
replied
quietly
very
well
when
he
had
never
thought
of
it
yours
is
the
real
work
she
continued
quietly
without
you
we
jackals
could
exist
you
and
a
few
like
you
hold
everything
upon
your
shoulders
for
a
minute
there
was
a
silence
then
it
occurred
to
oleron
that
this
was
common
vulgar
grumbling
it
was
not
his
habit
suddenly
he
rose
and
began
to
stack
cups
and
plates
on
the
tray
sorry
you
catch
me
like
this
elsie
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
no
i
take
them
out
then
we
go
for
a
walk
if
you
like
he
carried
out
the
tray
and
then
began
to
show
miss
bengough
round
his
flat
she
made
few
comments
in
the
kitchen
she
asked
what
an
old
faded
square
of
reddish
frieze
was
that
barrett
used
as
a
cushion
for
her
wooden
chair
that
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
tell
what
it
is
oleron
replied
as
he
unfolded
the
bag
and
related
the
story
of
its
finding
in
the
i
think
i
know
what
it
is
said
miss
bengough
it
been
used
to
wrap
up
a
harp
before
putting
it
into
its
case
by
jove
that
probably
just
what
it
was
said
oleron
i
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
they
finished
the
tour
of
the
flat
and
returned
to
the
and
who
lives
in
the
rest
of
the
house
miss
bengough
asked
i
dare
say
a
tramp
sleeps
in
the
cellar
occasionally
nobody
else
hm
well
i
tell
you
what
i
think
about
it
if
you
like
i
should
like
you
never
work
here
oh
said
oleron
quickly
why
not
you
never
finish
here
why
i
do
know
but
you
wo
i
know
it
you
have
to
leave
before
you
get
on
with
that
book
he
mused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
is
that
a
little
prejudiced
elsie
perfectly
ridiculous
as
an
argument
it
has
a
leg
to
stand
on
but
there
it
is
she
replied
her
mouth
once
more
full
of
the
hat
pins
oleron
was
reaching
down
his
hat
and
coat
he
laughed
i
can
only
hope
you
entirely
wrong
he
said
for
i
shall
be
in
a
serious
mess
if
is
out
in
the
autumn
iv
as
oleron
sat
by
his
fire
that
evening
pondering
miss
prognostication
that
difficulties
awaited
him
in
his
work
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
have
been
far
better
had
she
kept
her
beliefs
to
herself
no
man
does
a
thing
better
for
having
his
confidence
damped
at
the
outset
and
to
speak
of
difficulties
is
in
a
sense
to
make
them
speech
itself
becomes
a
deterrent
act
to
which
other
discouragements
accrete
until
the
very
event
of
which
warning
is
given
is
as
likely
as
not
to
come
to
pass
he
heartily
confounded
her
an
influence
hostile
to
the
completion
of
had
been
born
and
in
some
illogical
dogmatic
way
women
seem
to
have
she
had
attached
this
antagonistic
influence
to
his
new
abode
was
ever
anything
so
absurd
you
never
finish
here
why
not
was
this
her
idea
of
the
luxury
that
saps
the
springs
of
action
and
brings
a
man
down
to
indolence
and
dropping
out
of
the
race
the
place
was
well
enough
it
was
entirely
charming
for
that
matter
but
it
was
not
so
demoralising
as
all
that
no
elsie
had
missed
the
mark
that
time
he
moved
his
chair
to
look
round
the
room
that
smiled
positively
smiled
in
the
firelight
he
too
smiled
as
if
pity
was
to
be
entertained
for
a
maligned
apartment
even
that
slight
lack
of
robust
colour
he
had
remarked
was
not
noticeable
in
the
soft
glow
the
drawn
chintz
curtains
they
had
a
flowered
and
trellised
pattern
with
baskets
and
oaten
pipes
fell
in
long
quiet
folds
to
the
the
rows
of
bindings
in
old
bookcases
took
the
light
richly
the
last
trace
of
sallowness
had
gone
with
the
daylight
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
it
had
been
elsie
herself
who
had
seemed
a
little
out
of
the
picture
that
reflection
struck
him
a
little
and
presently
he
returned
to
it
yes
the
room
had
quite
accidentally
done
miss
bengough
a
disservice
that
afternoon
it
had
in
some
subtle
but
unmistakable
way
placed
her
marked
a
contrast
of
qualities
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
slightly
ridiculous
proposition
that
the
room
in
which
oleron
sat
characterised
by
a
certain
sparsity
and
lack
of
vigour
so
much
the
worse
for
miss
bengough
she
certainly
erred
on
the
side
of
redundancy
and
general
muchness
and
if
one
must
contrast
abstract
qualities
oleron
inclined
to
the
austere
in
taste
yes
here
oleron
had
made
a
distinct
discovery
he
wondered
he
had
not
made
it
before
he
pictured
miss
bengough
again
as
she
had
appeared
that
afternoon
large
showy
moistly
pink
with
that
quality
of
the
prize
bloom
exuding
as
it
were
from
her
and
instantly
she
suffered
in
his
thought
he
even
recognised
now
that
he
had
noticed
something
odd
at
the
time
and
that
unconsciously
his
attitude
even
while
she
had
been
there
had
been
one
of
criticism
the
mechanism
of
her
was
a
little
obvious
her
melting
humidity
was
the
result
of
analysable
processes
and
behind
her
there
had
seemed
to
lurk
some
dim
shape
emblematic
of
mortality
he
had
never
during
the
ten
years
of
their
intimacy
dreamed
for
a
moment
of
asking
her
to
marry
him
none
the
less
he
now
felt
for
the
first
time
a
thankfulness
that
he
had
not
done
so
then
suddenly
and
swiftly
his
face
flamed
that
he
should
be
thinking
thus
of
his
friend
what
elsie
bengough
with
whom
he
had
spent
weeks
and
weeks
of
afternoons
she
the
good
chum
on
whose
help
he
would
have
counted
had
all
the
rest
of
the
world
failed
him
she
whose
loyalty
to
him
would
not
he
knew
swerve
as
long
as
there
was
breath
in
her
elsie
to
be
even
in
thought
dissected
thus
he
was
an
ingrate
and
a
cad
had
she
been
there
in
that
moment
he
would
have
abased
himself
before
her
for
ten
minutes
and
more
he
sat
still
gazing
into
the
fire
with
that
humiliating
red
fading
slowly
from
his
cheeks
all
was
still
within
and
without
save
for
a
tiny
musical
tinkling
that
came
from
his
kitchen
the
dripping
of
water
from
an
imperfectly
tap
into
the
vessel
beneath
it
mechanically
he
began
to
beat
with
his
finger
to
the
faintly
heard
falling
of
the
drops
the
tiny
regular
movement
seemed
to
hasten
that
shameful
withdrawal
from
his
face
he
grew
cool
once
more
and
when
he
resumed
his
meditation
he
was
all
unconscious
that
he
took
it
up
again
at
the
same
point
it
was
not
only
her
florid
superfluity
of
build
that
he
had
approached
in
the
attitude
of
criticism
he
was
conscious
also
of
the
wide
differences
between
her
mind
and
his
own
he
felt
no
thankfulness
that
up
to
a
certain
point
their
natures
had
ever
run
companionably
side
by
side
he
was
now
full
of
questions
beyond
that
point
their
intellects
diverged
there
was
no
denying
it
and
looking
back
he
was
inclined
to
doubt
whether
there
had
been
any
real
coincidence
true
he
had
read
his
writings
to
her
and
she
had
appeared
to
speak
comprehendingly
and
to
the
point
but
what
can
a
man
do
who
having
assumed
that
another
sees
as
he
does
is
suddenly
brought
up
sharp
by
something
that
falsifies
and
discredits
all
that
has
gone
before
he
doubted
all
now
it
did
for
a
moment
occur
to
him
that
the
man
who
demands
of
a
friend
more
than
can
be
given
to
him
is
in
danger
of
losing
that
friend
but
he
put
the
thought
aside
again
he
ceased
to
think
and
again
moved
his
finger
to
the
distant
dripping
of
the
tap
and
now
he
resumed
if
these
things
were
true
of
elsie
bengough
they
were
also
true
of
the
creation
of
which
she
was
the
prototype
romilly
bishop
and
since
he
could
say
of
romilly
what
for
very
shame
he
could
not
say
of
elsie
he
gave
his
thoughts
rein
he
did
so
in
that
smiling
room
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
faintly
heard
tap
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
about
it
he
hated
the
central
character
of
his
novel
even
as
he
had
described
her
physically
she
overpowered
the
senses
she
was
rank
it
became
true
the
moment
he
formulated
his
thought
gulliver
had
described
the
brobdingnagian
thus
and
mentally
and
spiritually
she
corresponded
was
unsensitive
limited
common
the
model
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
the
model
stuck
out
through
fifteen
vulgar
and
blatant
chapters
to
such
a
pitch
that
without
seeing
the
reason
he
had
been
unable
to
begin
the
sixteenth
he
marvelled
that
it
had
only
just
dawned
upon
him
and
was
to
have
been
his
beatrice
his
vision
as
elsie
she
was
to
have
gone
into
the
furnace
of
his
art
and
she
was
to
have
come
out
the
woman
all
men
desire
her
thoughts
were
to
have
been
culled
from
his
own
finest
her
form
from
his
dearest
dreams
and
her
setting
wherever
he
could
find
one
fit
for
her
worth
he
had
brooded
long
before
making
the
attempt
then
one
day
he
had
felt
her
stir
within
him
as
a
mother
feels
a
quickening
and
he
had
begun
to
write
and
so
he
had
added
chapter
to
chapter
and
those
fifteen
sodden
chapters
were
what
he
had
produced
again
he
sat
softly
moving
his
finger
then
he
bestirred
himself
she
must
go
all
fifteen
chapters
of
her
that
was
settled
for
what
was
to
take
her
place
his
mind
was
a
blank
but
one
thing
at
a
time
a
man
is
not
excused
from
taking
the
wrong
course
because
the
right
one
is
not
immediately
revealed
to
him
better
would
come
if
it
was
to
come
in
the
meantime
he
rose
fetched
the
fifteen
chapters
and
read
them
over
before
he
should
drop
them
into
the
fire
but
instead
of
putting
them
into
the
fire
he
let
them
fall
from
his
hand
he
became
conscious
of
the
dripping
of
the
tap
again
it
had
a
tinkling
gamut
of
four
or
five
notes
on
which
it
rang
irregular
changes
and
it
was
foolishly
sweet
and
in
his
mind
oleron
could
see
the
gathering
of
each
drop
its
little
tremble
on
the
lip
of
the
tap
and
the
tiny
percussion
of
its
fall
plink
plunk
minimised
almost
to
inaudibility
following
the
lowest
note
there
seemed
to
be
a
brief
phrase
irregularly
repeated
and
presently
oleron
found
himself
waiting
for
the
recurrence
of
this
phrase
it
was
quite
pretty
but
it
did
not
conduce
to
wakefulness
and
oleron
dozed
over
his
fire
when
he
awoke
again
the
fire
had
burned
low
and
the
flames
of
the
candles
were
licking
the
rims
of
the
sheffield
sticks
sluggishly
he
rose
yawned
went
his
nightly
round
of
and
and
passed
into
his
bedroom
soon
he
slept
soundly
but
a
curious
little
sequel
followed
on
the
morrow
barrett
usually
tapped
not
at
his
door
but
at
the
wooden
wall
beyond
which
lay
bed
and
then
oleron
rose
put
on
his
and
admitted
her
he
was
not
conscious
that
as
he
did
so
that
morning
he
hummed
an
air
but
barrett
lingered
with
her
hand
on
the
and
her
face
a
little
averted
and
smiling
me
her
soft
falsetto
rose
but
that
will
be
a
very
tune
oleron
i
will
not
have
heard
it
this
years
what
tune
oleron
asked
the
tune
indeed
that
you
was
humming
sir
oleron
had
his
thumb
in
the
flap
of
a
letter
it
remained
there
was
humming
sing
it
mrs
barrett
barrett
i
have
no
voice
for
singing
oleron
it
was
ann
pugh
was
the
singer
of
our
family
but
the
tune
will
be
very
and
it
is
called
beckoning
fair
one
try
to
sing
it
said
oleron
his
thumb
still
in
the
envelope
and
barrett
with
much
dimpling
and
confusion
hummed
the
air
they
do
say
it
was
sung
to
a
harp
oleron
and
it
will
be
very
she
concluded
and
was
singing
that
indeed
you
wass
i
would
not
be
likely
to
tell
you
lies
with
a
very
well
let
me
have
breakfast
oleron
opened
his
letter
but
the
trifling
circumstance
struck
him
as
more
odd
than
he
would
have
admitted
to
himself
the
phrase
he
had
hummed
had
been
that
which
he
had
associated
with
the
falling
from
the
tap
on
the
evening
before
v
even
more
curious
than
that
the
commonplace
dripping
of
an
ordinary
should
have
tallied
so
closely
with
an
actually
existing
air
was
another
result
it
had
namely
that
it
awakened
or
seemed
to
awaken
in
oleron
an
abnormal
sensitiveness
to
other
noises
of
the
old
house
it
has
been
remarked
that
silence
obtains
its
fullest
and
most
impressive
quality
when
it
is
broken
by
some
minute
sound
and
truth
to
tell
the
place
was
never
still
perhaps
the
mildness
of
the
spring
air
operated
on
its
torpid
old
timbers
perhaps
oleron
fires
caused
it
to
stretch
its
old
anatomy
and
certainly
a
whole
world
of
insect
life
bored
and
burrowed
in
its
baulks
and
joists
at
any
rate
oleron
had
only
to
sit
quiet
in
his
chair
and
to
wait
for
a
minute
or
two
in
order
to
become
aware
of
such
a
change
in
the
auditory
scale
as
comes
upon
a
man
who
conceiving
the
midsummer
woods
to
be
motionless
and
still
all
at
once
finds
his
ear
sharpened
to
the
crepitation
of
a
myriad
insects
and
he
smiled
to
think
of
man
arbitrary
distinction
between
that
which
has
life
and
that
which
has
not
here
quite
apart
from
such
recognisable
sounds
as
the
scampering
of
mice
the
falling
of
plaster
behind
his
panelling
and
the
popping
of
purses
or
coffins
from
his
fire
was
a
whole
house
talking
to
him
had
he
but
known
its
language
beams
settled
with
a
tired
sigh
into
their
old
mortices
creatures
ticked
in
the
walls
joints
cracked
boards
complained
with
no
palpable
stirring
of
the
air
changed
their
positions
with
a
soft
knock
in
their
frames
and
whether
the
place
had
life
in
this
sense
or
not
it
had
at
all
events
a
winsome
personality
it
needed
but
an
hour
of
musing
for
oleron
to
conceive
the
idea
that
as
his
own
body
stood
in
friendly
relation
to
his
soul
so
by
an
extension
and
an
attenuation
his
habitation
might
fantastically
be
supposed
to
stand
in
some
relation
to
himself
he
even
amused
himself
with
the
fancy
that
he
might
so
identify
himself
with
the
place
that
some
future
tenant
taking
possession
might
regard
it
as
in
a
sense
haunted
it
would
be
rather
a
joke
if
he
a
perfectly
harmless
author
with
nothing
on
his
mind
worse
than
a
novel
he
had
discovered
he
must
begin
again
should
turn
out
to
be
laying
the
foundation
of
a
future
ghost
in
proportion
however
as
he
felt
this
growing
attachment
to
the
fabric
of
his
abode
elsie
bengough
from
being
merely
unattracted
began
to
show
a
dislike
of
the
place
that
was
more
and
more
marked
and
she
did
not
scruple
to
speak
of
her
aversion
it
does
belong
to
at
all
and
for
you
especially
it
bad
she
said
with
decision
you
only
too
ready
to
let
go
your
hold
on
actual
things
and
to
slip
into
apathy
ought
to
be
in
a
place
with
concrete
floors
and
a
patent
and
a
tradesmen
lift
and
it
would
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
if
you
had
a
job
that
made
you
scramble
and
rub
elbows
with
your
now
if
i
could
get
you
a
job
for
say
two
or
three
days
a
week
one
that
would
allow
you
heaps
of
time
for
your
proper
work
would
you
take
it
somehow
oleron
resented
a
little
being
diagnosed
like
this
he
thanked
miss
bengough
but
without
a
smile
thank
you
but
i
do
think
so
after
all
each
of
us
has
his
own
life
to
live
he
could
not
refrain
from
adding
his
own
life
to
live
how
long
is
it
since
you
were
out
paul
about
two
hours
i
do
mean
to
buy
stamps
or
to
post
a
letter
how
long
is
it
since
you
had
anything
like
a
stretch
oh
some
little
time
perhaps
i
do
know
since
i
was
here
last
i
have
been
out
much
and
has
progressed
much
better
for
your
being
cooped
up
i
think
she
has
i
laying
the
foundations
of
her
i
shall
begin
the
actual
writing
presently
it
seemed
as
if
miss
bengough
had
forgotten
their
tussle
about
the
first
she
frowned
turned
half
away
and
then
quickly
turned
again
ah
so
you
still
got
that
ridiculous
idea
in
your
head
if
you
mean
said
oleron
slowly
that
i
discarded
the
old
and
am
at
work
on
a
new
one
you
right
i
have
still
got
that
idea
in
my
head
something
uncordial
in
his
tone
struck
her
but
she
was
a
fighter
his
own
absurd
sensitiveness
hardened
her
she
gave
a
pshaw
of
impatience
where
is
the
old
one
she
demanded
abruptly
why
asked
oleron
i
want
to
see
it
i
want
to
show
some
of
it
to
you
i
want
if
not
entirely
to
bring
you
back
to
your
senses
this
time
it
was
he
who
turned
his
back
but
when
he
turned
round
again
he
spoke
more
gently
it
no
good
elsie
i
responsible
for
the
way
i
go
and
you
must
allow
me
to
go
it
even
if
it
should
seem
wrong
to
you
believe
me
i
am
giving
thought
to
it
the
manuscript
i
was
on
the
point
of
burning
it
but
i
did
it
in
that
if
you
must
see
it
miss
bengough
crossed
quickly
to
the
and
lifted
the
lid
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
exclamation
and
put
the
back
of
her
hand
to
her
mouth
she
spoke
over
her
shoulder
you
ought
to
knock
those
nails
in
paul
she
said
he
strode
to
her
side
what
what
is
it
what
the
matter
he
asked
i
did
knock
them
in
or
rather
pulled
them
out
you
left
enough
to
scratch
with
she
replied
showing
her
hand
from
the
upper
wrist
to
the
knuckle
of
the
little
finger
a
welling
red
wound
showed
good
gracious
oleron
ejaculated
here
come
to
the
bathroom
and
bathe
it
quickly
he
hurried
her
to
the
bathroom
turned
on
warm
water
and
bathed
and
cleansed
the
bad
gash
then
still
holding
the
hand
he
turned
cold
water
on
it
uttering
broken
phrases
of
astonishment
and
concern
good
lord
how
did
that
happen
as
far
as
i
knew
i
is
this
water
too
cold
does
that
hurt
i
ca
imagine
how
on
earth
there
do
no
one
moment
longer
i
can
bear
it
she
murmured
her
eyes
closed
presently
he
led
her
back
to
the
and
bound
the
hand
in
one
of
his
handkerchiefs
but
his
face
did
not
lose
its
expression
of
perplexity
he
had
spent
half
a
day
in
opening
and
making
serviceable
the
three
and
he
could
not
conceive
how
he
had
come
to
leave
an
inch
and
a
half
of
rusty
nail
standing
in
the
wood
he
himself
had
opened
the
lids
of
each
of
them
a
dozen
times
and
had
not
noticed
any
nail
but
there
it
was
it
shall
come
out
now
at
all
events
he
muttered
as
he
went
for
a
pair
of
pincers
and
he
made
no
mistake
about
it
that
time
elsie
bengough
had
sunk
into
a
chair
and
her
face
was
rather
white
but
in
her
hand
was
the
manuscript
of
she
had
not
finished
with
yet
presently
she
returned
to
the
charge
oh
paul
it
will
be
the
greatest
mistake
you
ever
made
if
you
do
not
publish
this
she
said
he
hung
his
head
genuinely
distressed
he
could
get
that
incident
of
the
nail
out
of
his
head
and
occupied
a
second
place
in
his
thoughts
for
the
moment
but
still
she
insisted
and
when
presently
he
spoke
it
was
almost
as
if
he
asked
her
pardon
for
something
what
can
i
say
elsie
i
can
only
hope
that
when
you
see
the
new
version
you
see
how
right
i
am
and
if
in
spite
of
all
you
like
her
well
he
made
a
hopeless
gesture
do
you
see
that
i
be
guided
by
my
own
lights
she
was
silent
come
elsie
he
said
gently
we
got
along
well
so
far
do
let
us
split
on
this
the
last
words
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
before
he
regretted
them
she
had
been
nursing
her
injured
hand
with
her
eyes
once
more
closed
but
her
lips
and
lids
quivered
simultaneously
her
voice
shook
as
she
spoke
i
ca
help
saying
it
paul
but
you
are
so
greatly
changed
hush
elsie
he
murmured
soothingly
you
had
a
shock
rest
for
a
while
how
could
i
change
i
do
know
but
you
are
you
not
been
yourself
ever
since
you
came
here
i
wish
you
never
seen
the
place
it
stopped
your
work
making
you
into
a
person
i
hardly
know
and
it
made
me
horribly
anxious
about
you
oh
how
my
hand
is
beginning
to
throb
poor
child
he
murmured
will
you
let
me
take
you
to
a
doctor
and
have
it
properly
dressed
no
i
shall
be
all
right
presently
i
keep
it
raised
she
put
her
elbow
on
the
back
of
her
chair
and
the
bandaged
hand
rested
lightly
on
his
shoulder
at
that
touch
an
entirely
new
anxiety
stirred
suddenly
within
him
hundreds
of
times
previously
on
their
jaunts
and
excursions
she
had
slipped
her
hand
within
his
arm
as
she
might
have
slipped
it
into
the
arm
of
a
brother
and
he
had
accepted
the
little
affectionate
gesture
as
a
brother
might
have
accepted
it
but
now
for
the
first
time
there
rushed
into
his
mind
a
hundred
startling
questions
her
eyes
were
still
closed
and
her
head
had
fallen
pathetically
back
and
there
was
a
lost
and
ineffable
smile
on
her
parted
lips
the
truth
broke
in
upon
him
good
god
and
he
had
never
divined
it
and
stranger
than
all
was
that
now
that
he
did
see
that
she
was
lost
in
love
of
him
there
came
to
him
not
sorrow
and
humility
and
abasement
but
something
else
that
he
struggled
in
vain
against
something
entirely
strange
and
new
that
had
he
analysed
it
he
would
have
found
to
be
petulance
and
irritation
and
resentment
and
ungentleness
the
sudden
selfish
prompting
mastered
him
before
he
was
aware
he
all
but
gave
it
words
what
was
she
doing
there
at
all
why
was
she
not
getting
on
with
her
own
work
why
was
she
here
interfering
with
his
who
had
given
her
this
guardianship
over
him
that
lately
she
had
put
forward
so
assertively
changed
it
was
she
not
himself
who
had
changed
but
by
the
time
she
had
opened
her
eyes
again
he
had
overcome
his
resentment
sufficiently
to
speak
gently
albeit
with
reserve
i
wish
you
would
let
me
take
you
to
a
doctor
she
rose
no
thank
you
paul
she
said
i
go
now
if
i
need
a
dressing
get
one
take
the
other
hand
please
he
did
not
attempt
to
detain
her
he
walked
with
her
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
along
the
narrow
alley
she
turned
it
would
be
a
long
way
to
come
if
you
happened
not
to
be
in
she
said
i
send
you
a
postcard
the
next
time
at
the
gate
she
turned
again
leave
here
paul
she
said
with
a
mournful
look
everything
wrong
with
this
house
then
she
was
gone
oleron
returned
to
his
room
he
crossed
straight
to
the
he
opened
the
lid
and
stood
long
looking
at
it
then
he
closed
it
again
and
turned
away
that
rather
frightening
he
muttered
it
simply
not
possible
that
i
should
not
have
removed
that
nail
vi
oleron
knew
very
well
what
elsie
had
meant
when
she
had
said
that
her
next
visit
would
be
preceded
by
a
postcard
she
too
had
realised
that
at
last
at
last
he
knew
knew
and
did
want
her
it
gave
him
a
miserable
pitiful
pang
therefore
when
she
came
again
within
a
week
knocking
at
the
door
unannounced
she
spoke
from
the
landing
she
did
not
intend
to
stay
she
said
and
he
had
to
press
her
before
she
would
so
much
as
enter
her
excuse
for
calling
was
that
she
had
heard
of
an
inquiry
for
short
stories
that
he
might
be
wise
to
follow
up
he
thanked
her
then
her
business
over
she
seemed
anxious
to
get
away
again
oleron
did
not
seek
to
detain
her
even
he
saw
through
the
pretext
of
the
stories
and
he
accompanied
her
down
the
stairs
but
elsie
bengough
had
no
luck
whatever
in
that
house
a
second
accident
befell
her
down
the
staircase
there
was
the
sharp
sound
of
splintering
wood
and
she
checked
a
loud
cry
oleron
knew
the
woodwork
to
be
old
but
he
himself
had
ascended
and
descended
frequently
enough
without
mishap
elsie
had
put
her
foot
through
one
of
the
stairs
he
sprang
to
her
side
in
alarm
oh
i
say
my
poor
girl
she
laughed
hysterically
it
my
weight
i
know
i
getting
fat
keep
still
let
me
clear
these
splinters
away
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
she
continued
to
laugh
and
sob
that
it
was
her
weight
she
was
getting
fat
he
thrust
downwards
at
the
broken
boards
the
extrication
was
no
easy
matter
and
her
torn
boot
showed
him
how
badly
the
foot
and
ankle
within
it
must
be
abraded
good
god
good
god
he
muttered
over
and
over
again
i
shall
be
too
heavy
for
anything
soon
she
sobbed
and
laughed
but
she
refused
to
reascend
and
to
examine
her
hurt
no
let
me
go
quickly
let
me
go
quickly
she
repeated
but
it
a
frightful
gash
no
not
so
bad
let
me
get
away
quickly
i
i
not
wanted
at
her
words
that
she
was
not
wanted
his
head
dropped
as
if
she
had
given
him
a
buffet
elsie
he
choked
brokenly
and
shocked
but
she
too
made
a
quick
gesture
as
if
she
put
something
violently
aside
oh
paul
not
not
of
course
i
do
mean
that
too
in
a
sense
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
but
if
the
other
ca
be
spare
me
this
now
i
i
would
have
come
but
but
oh
i
did
i
try
to
keep
away
it
was
intolerable
heartbreaking
but
what
could
he
do
what
could
he
say
he
did
not
love
her
let
me
go
i
not
wanted
let
me
take
away
what
left
of
me
dear
elsie
you
are
very
dear
to
me
but
again
she
made
the
gesture
as
of
putting
something
violently
aside
no
not
that
not
anything
less
do
offer
me
anything
less
leave
me
a
little
pride
let
me
get
my
hat
and
coat
let
me
take
you
to
a
doctor
he
muttered
but
she
refused
she
refused
even
the
support
of
his
arm
she
gave
another
unsteady
laugh
i
sorry
i
broke
your
stairs
paul
you
will
go
and
see
about
the
short
stories
wo
you
he
groaned
then
if
you
wo
see
a
doctor
will
you
go
across
the
square
and
let
barrett
look
at
you
look
there
barrett
passing
now
the
barrett
was
looking
curiously
down
the
alley
but
as
oleron
was
about
to
call
him
he
made
off
without
a
word
elsie
seemed
anxious
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
clear
of
the
place
and
finally
promised
to
go
straight
to
a
doctor
but
insisted
on
going
alone
she
said
and
oleron
watched
her
until
she
was
past
the
to
let
boards
as
if
he
feared
that
even
they
might
fall
upon
her
and
maim
her
that
night
oleron
did
not
dine
he
had
far
too
much
on
his
mind
he
walked
from
room
to
room
of
his
flat
as
if
he
could
have
walked
away
from
elsie
bengough
haunting
cry
that
still
rang
in
his
ears
not
wanted
do
offer
me
anything
less
let
me
take
away
what
left
of
me
oh
if
he
could
only
have
persuaded
himself
that
he
loved
her
he
walked
until
twilight
fell
then
without
lighting
candles
he
stirred
up
the
fire
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
poor
poor
elsie
but
even
while
his
heart
ached
for
her
it
was
out
of
the
question
if
only
he
had
known
if
only
he
had
used
common
observation
but
those
walks
those
sisterly
takings
of
the
arm
what
a
fool
he
had
been
well
it
was
too
late
now
it
was
she
not
he
who
must
now
act
act
by
keeping
away
he
would
help
her
all
he
could
he
himself
would
not
sit
in
her
presence
if
she
came
he
would
hurry
her
out
again
as
fast
as
he
could
poor
poor
elsie
his
room
grew
dark
the
fire
burned
dead
and
he
continued
to
sit
wincing
from
time
to
time
as
a
fresh
tortured
phrase
rang
again
in
his
ears
then
suddenly
he
knew
not
why
he
found
himself
anxious
for
her
in
a
new
sense
uneasy
about
her
personal
safety
a
horrible
fancy
that
even
then
she
might
be
looking
over
an
embankment
down
into
dark
water
that
she
might
even
now
be
glancing
up
at
the
hook
on
the
door
took
him
women
had
been
known
to
do
those
things
then
there
would
be
an
inquest
and
he
himself
would
be
called
upon
to
identify
her
and
would
be
asked
how
she
had
come
by
an
wound
on
the
hand
and
a
bad
abrasion
of
the
ankle
barrett
would
say
that
he
had
seen
her
leaving
his
house
then
he
recognised
that
his
thoughts
were
morbid
by
an
effort
of
will
he
put
them
aside
and
sat
for
a
while
listening
to
the
faint
creakings
and
tickings
and
rappings
within
his
panelling
if
only
he
could
have
married
her
but
he
could
her
face
had
risen
before
him
again
as
he
had
seen
it
on
the
stairs
drawn
with
pain
and
ugly
and
swollen
with
tears
ugly
yes
positively
blubbered
if
tears
were
weapons
as
they
were
said
to
be
such
tears
were
weapons
turned
against
themselves
suicide
again
then
all
at
once
he
found
himself
attentively
considering
her
two
accidents
extraordinary
they
had
been
both
of
them
he
have
left
that
old
nail
standing
in
the
wood
why
he
had
fetched
tools
specially
from
the
kitchen
and
he
was
convinced
that
that
step
that
had
broken
beneath
her
weight
had
been
as
sound
as
the
others
it
was
inexplicable
if
these
things
could
happen
anything
could
happen
there
was
not
a
beam
nor
a
jamb
in
the
place
that
might
not
fall
without
warning
not
a
plank
that
might
not
crash
inwards
not
a
nail
that
might
not
become
a
dagger
the
whole
place
was
full
of
life
even
now
as
he
sat
there
in
the
dark
he
heard
its
crowds
of
noises
as
if
the
house
had
been
one
great
microphone
only
half
conscious
that
he
did
so
he
had
been
sitting
for
some
time
identifying
these
noises
attributing
to
each
crack
or
creak
or
knock
its
material
cause
but
there
was
one
noise
which
again
not
fully
conscious
of
the
omission
he
had
not
sought
to
account
for
it
had
last
come
some
minutes
ago
it
came
again
now
a
sort
of
soft
sweeping
rustle
that
seemed
to
hold
an
almost
inaudibly
minute
crackling
for
half
a
minute
or
so
it
had
oleron
attention
then
his
heavy
thoughts
were
of
elsie
bengough
again
he
was
nearer
to
loving
her
in
that
moment
than
he
had
ever
been
he
thought
how
to
some
men
their
loved
ones
were
but
the
dearer
for
those
poor
mortal
blemishes
that
tell
us
we
are
but
sojourners
on
earth
with
a
common
fate
not
far
distant
that
makes
it
hardly
worth
while
to
do
anything
but
love
for
the
time
remaining
strangling
sobs
blearing
tears
bodies
buffeted
by
sickness
hearts
and
mind
callous
and
hard
with
the
rubs
of
the
world
how
little
love
there
would
be
were
these
things
a
barrier
to
love
in
that
sense
he
did
love
elsie
bengough
what
her
happiness
had
never
moved
in
him
her
sorrow
almost
awoke
suddenly
his
meditation
went
his
ear
had
once
more
become
conscious
of
that
soft
and
repeated
noise
the
long
sweep
with
the
almost
inaudible
crackle
in
it
again
and
again
it
came
with
a
curious
insistence
and
urgency
it
quickened
a
little
as
he
became
increasingly
attentive
it
seemed
to
oleron
that
it
grew
louder
all
at
once
he
started
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
tense
and
listening
the
silky
rustle
came
again
he
was
trying
to
attach
it
to
something
the
next
moment
he
had
leapt
to
his
feet
unnerved
and
terrified
his
chair
hung
poised
for
a
moment
and
then
went
over
setting
the
clattering
as
it
fell
there
was
only
one
noise
in
the
world
like
that
which
had
caused
him
to
spring
thus
to
his
feet
the
next
time
it
came
oleron
felt
behind
him
at
the
empty
air
with
his
hand
and
backed
slowly
until
he
found
himself
against
the
wall
god
in
heaven
the
ejaculation
broke
from
oleron
lips
the
sound
had
ceased
the
next
moment
he
had
given
a
high
cry
what
is
it
what
there
there
a
sound
of
scuttling
caused
his
knees
to
bend
under
him
for
a
moment
but
that
he
knew
was
a
mouse
that
was
not
something
that
his
stomach
turned
sick
and
his
mind
reeled
to
entertain
that
other
sound
the
like
of
which
was
not
in
the
world
had
now
entirely
ceased
and
again
he
called
he
called
and
continued
to
call
and
then
another
terror
a
terror
of
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
seized
him
he
did
not
dare
to
call
again
his
shaking
hand
went
to
his
pocket
for
a
match
but
found
none
he
thought
there
might
be
matches
on
the
mantelpiece
he
worked
his
way
to
the
mantelpiece
round
a
little
recess
without
for
a
moment
leaving
the
wall
then
his
hand
encountered
the
mantelpiece
and
groped
along
it
a
box
of
matches
fell
to
the
hearth
he
could
just
see
them
in
the
firelight
but
his
hand
could
not
pick
them
up
until
he
had
cornered
them
inside
the
fender
then
he
rose
and
struck
a
light
the
room
was
as
usual
he
struck
a
second
match
a
candle
stood
on
the
table
he
lighted
it
and
the
flame
sank
for
a
moment
and
then
burned
up
clear
again
he
looked
round
there
was
nothing
there
was
nothing
but
there
had
been
something
and
might
still
be
something
formerly
oleron
had
smiled
at
the
fantastic
thought
that
by
a
merging
and
interplay
of
identities
between
himself
and
his
beautiful
room
he
might
be
preparing
a
ghost
for
the
future
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
there
might
have
been
a
similar
merging
and
coalescence
in
the
yet
with
this
staggering
impossibility
he
was
now
face
to
face
something
did
persist
in
the
house
it
had
a
tenant
other
than
himself
and
that
tenant
whatsoever
or
whosoever
had
appalled
oleron
soul
by
producing
the
sound
of
a
woman
brushing
her
hair
vii
without
quite
knowing
how
he
came
to
be
there
oleron
found
himself
striding
over
the
loose
board
he
had
temporarily
placed
on
the
step
broken
by
miss
bengough
he
was
hatless
and
descending
the
stairs
not
until
later
did
there
return
to
him
a
hazy
memory
that
he
had
left
the
candle
burning
on
the
table
had
opened
the
door
no
wider
than
was
necessary
to
allow
the
passage
of
his
body
and
had
sidled
out
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
another
shock
awaited
him
something
dashed
with
a
flurry
up
from
the
disused
cellars
and
disappeared
out
of
the
door
it
was
only
a
cat
but
oleron
gave
a
childish
sob
he
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
stood
for
a
moment
under
the
to
let
boards
plucking
foolishly
at
his
lip
and
looking
up
at
the
glimmer
of
light
behind
one
of
his
red
blinds
then
still
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
moved
stumblingly
up
the
square
there
was
a
small
round
the
corner
oleron
had
never
entered
it
but
he
entered
it
now
and
put
down
a
shilling
that
missed
the
counter
by
inches
b
b
bran
brandy
he
said
and
then
stooped
to
look
for
the
shilling
he
had
the
little
sawdusted
bar
to
himself
what
company
there
was
carters
and
labourers
and
the
small
tradesmen
of
the
neighbourhood
was
gathered
in
the
farther
compartment
beyond
the
space
where
the
landlady
moved
among
her
taps
and
bottles
oleron
sat
down
on
a
hardwood
settee
with
a
perforated
seat
drank
half
his
brandy
and
then
thinking
he
might
as
well
drink
it
as
spill
it
finished
it
then
he
fell
to
wondering
which
of
the
men
whose
voices
he
heard
across
the
would
undertake
the
removal
of
his
effects
on
the
morrow
in
the
meantime
he
ordered
more
brandy
for
he
did
not
intend
to
go
back
to
that
room
where
he
had
left
the
candle
burning
oh
no
he
could
have
faced
even
the
entry
and
the
staircase
with
the
broken
step
certainly
not
that
fascinating
room
he
would
go
back
for
the
present
to
his
old
arrangement
of
workroom
and
separate
he
would
go
to
his
old
landlady
at
once
presently
when
he
had
finished
his
brandy
and
see
if
she
could
put
him
up
for
the
night
his
glass
was
empty
now
he
rose
had
it
refilled
and
sat
down
again
and
if
anybody
asked
his
reason
for
removing
again
oh
he
had
reason
enough
reason
enough
nails
that
put
themselves
back
into
wood
again
and
gashed
people
hands
steps
that
broke
when
you
trod
on
them
and
women
who
came
into
a
man
place
and
brushed
their
hair
in
the
dark
were
reasons
enough
he
was
querulous
and
injured
about
it
all
he
had
taken
the
place
for
himself
not
for
invisible
women
to
brush
their
hair
in
that
lawyer
fellow
in
lincoln
inn
should
be
told
so
too
before
many
hours
were
out
it
was
outrageous
letting
people
in
for
agreements
like
that
a
partition
divided
the
compartment
where
oleron
sat
from
the
space
where
the
landlady
moved
but
it
stopped
seven
or
eight
inches
above
the
level
of
the
counter
there
was
no
partition
at
the
farther
bar
presently
oleron
raising
his
eyes
saw
that
faces
were
watching
him
through
the
aperture
the
faces
disappeared
when
he
looked
at
them
he
moved
to
a
corner
where
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
other
bar
but
this
brought
him
into
line
with
the
landlady
she
knew
him
by
sight
had
doubtless
seen
him
passing
and
repassing
and
presently
she
made
a
remark
on
the
weather
oleron
did
not
know
what
he
replied
but
it
sufficed
to
call
forth
the
further
remark
that
the
winter
had
been
a
bad
one
for
influenza
but
that
the
spring
weather
seemed
to
be
coming
at
last
even
this
slight
contact
with
the
commonplace
steadied
oleron
a
little
an
idle
nascent
wonder
whether
the
landlady
brushed
her
hair
every
night
and
if
so
whether
it
gave
out
those
little
electric
cracklings
was
shut
down
with
a
snap
and
oleron
was
better
with
his
next
glass
of
brandy
he
was
all
for
going
back
to
his
flat
not
go
back
indeed
he
would
go
back
they
should
very
soon
see
whether
he
was
to
be
turned
out
of
his
place
like
that
he
began
to
wonder
why
he
was
doing
the
rather
unusual
thing
he
was
doing
at
that
moment
unusual
for
him
sitting
hatless
drinking
brandy
in
a
suppose
he
were
to
tell
the
landlady
all
about
it
to
tell
her
that
a
caller
had
scratched
her
hand
on
a
nail
had
later
had
the
bad
luck
to
put
her
foot
through
a
rotten
stair
and
that
he
himself
in
an
old
house
full
of
squeaks
and
creaks
and
whispers
had
heard
a
minute
noise
and
had
bolted
from
it
in
fright
what
would
she
think
of
him
that
he
was
mad
of
course
pshaw
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
he
had
been
doing
enough
work
to
occupy
him
he
had
been
dreaming
his
days
away
filling
his
head
with
a
lot
of
moonshine
about
a
new
as
if
the
old
one
was
not
good
enough
and
now
he
was
surprised
that
the
devil
should
enter
an
empty
head
yes
he
would
go
back
he
would
take
a
walk
in
the
air
first
he
walked
enough
lately
and
then
he
would
take
himself
in
hand
settle
the
hash
of
that
sixteenth
chapter
of
fancy
he
had
actually
been
fool
enough
to
think
of
destroying
fifteen
chapters
and
thenceforward
he
would
remember
that
he
had
obligations
to
his
and
work
to
do
in
the
world
there
was
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
he
finished
his
brandy
and
went
out
he
had
walked
for
some
time
before
any
other
bearing
of
the
matter
than
that
on
himself
occurred
to
him
at
first
the
fresh
air
had
increased
the
heady
effect
of
the
brandy
he
had
drunk
but
afterwards
his
mind
grew
clearer
than
it
had
been
since
morning
and
the
clearer
it
grew
the
less
final
did
his
boastful
become
and
the
firmer
his
conviction
that
when
all
explanations
had
been
made
there
remained
something
that
could
not
be
explained
his
hysteria
of
an
hour
before
had
passed
he
grew
steadily
calmer
but
the
disquieting
conviction
remained
a
deep
fear
took
possession
of
him
it
was
a
fear
for
elsie
for
something
in
his
place
was
inimical
to
her
safety
of
themselves
her
two
accidents
might
not
have
persuaded
him
of
this
but
she
herself
had
said
it
not
wanted
and
she
had
declared
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
place
she
had
seen
it
before
he
had
well
and
good
one
thing
stood
out
clearly
namely
that
if
this
was
so
she
must
be
kept
away
for
quite
another
reason
than
that
which
had
so
confounded
and
humiliated
oleron
luckily
she
had
expressed
her
intention
of
staying
away
she
must
be
held
to
that
intention
he
must
see
to
it
and
he
must
see
to
it
all
the
more
that
he
now
saw
his
first
impulse
never
to
set
foot
in
the
place
again
was
absurd
people
did
not
do
that
kind
of
thing
with
elsie
made
secure
he
could
not
with
any
respect
to
himself
suffer
himself
to
be
turned
out
by
a
shadow
nor
even
by
a
danger
merely
because
it
was
a
danger
he
had
to
live
somewhere
and
he
would
live
there
he
must
return
he
mastered
the
faint
chill
of
fear
that
came
with
the
decision
and
turned
in
his
walk
abruptly
should
fear
grow
on
him
again
he
would
perhaps
take
one
more
glass
of
brandy
but
by
the
time
he
reached
the
short
street
that
led
to
the
square
he
was
too
late
for
more
brandy
the
little
was
still
lighted
but
closed
and
one
or
two
men
were
standing
talking
on
the
kerb
oleron
noticed
that
a
sudden
silence
fell
on
them
as
he
passed
and
he
noticed
further
that
the
barrett
whom
he
passed
a
little
lower
down
did
not
return
his
he
turned
in
at
the
broken
gate
hesitated
merely
an
instant
in
the
alley
and
then
mounted
his
stairs
again
only
an
inch
of
candle
remained
in
the
sheffield
stick
and
oleron
did
not
light
another
one
deliberately
he
forced
himself
to
take
it
up
and
to
make
the
tour
of
his
five
rooms
before
retiring
it
was
as
he
returned
from
the
kitchen
across
his
little
hall
that
he
noticed
that
a
letter
lay
on
the
floor
he
carried
it
into
his
and
glanced
at
the
envelope
before
opening
it
it
was
unstamped
and
had
been
put
into
the
door
by
hand
its
handwriting
was
clumsy
and
it
ran
from
beginning
to
end
without
comma
or
period
oleron
read
the
first
line
turned
to
the
signature
and
then
finished
the
letter
it
was
from
the
man
barrett
and
it
informed
oleron
that
he
barrett
would
be
obliged
if
oleron
would
make
other
arrangements
for
the
preparing
of
his
breakfasts
and
the
of
his
place
the
sting
lay
in
the
tail
that
is
to
say
the
postscript
this
consisted
of
a
text
of
scripture
it
embodied
an
allusion
that
could
only
be
to
elsie
bengough
a
frown
had
cut
deeply
into
oleron
brow
so
that
was
it
very
well
they
would
see
about
that
on
the
morrow
for
the
rest
this
seemed
merely
another
reason
why
elsie
should
keep
away
then
his
suppressed
rage
broke
out
the
lot
the
devil
himself
could
not
have
given
a
leer
at
anything
that
had
ever
passed
between
paul
oleron
and
elsie
bengough
yet
this
nosing
rascal
must
be
prying
and
talking
oleron
crumpled
the
paper
up
held
it
in
the
candle
flame
and
then
ground
the
ashes
under
his
heel
one
useful
purpose
however
the
letter
had
served
it
had
created
in
oleron
a
wrathful
blaze
that
effectually
banished
pale
shadows
nevertheless
one
other
puzzling
circumstance
was
to
close
the
day
as
he
undressed
he
chanced
to
glance
at
his
bed
the
coverlets
bore
an
impress
as
if
somebody
had
lain
on
them
oleron
could
not
remember
that
he
himself
had
lain
down
during
the
day
he
would
have
said
that
certainly
he
had
not
but
after
all
he
could
not
be
positive
his
indignation
for
elsie
acting
possibly
with
the
residue
of
the
brandy
in
him
excluded
all
other
considerations
and
he
put
out
his
candle
lay
down
and
passed
immediately
into
a
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
which
in
the
absence
of
barrett
morning
call
lasted
almost
once
round
the
clock
viii
to
the
man
who
pays
heed
to
that
voice
within
him
which
warns
him
that
twilight
and
danger
are
settling
over
his
soul
terror
is
apt
to
appear
an
absolute
thing
against
which
his
heart
must
be
safeguarded
in
a
twink
unless
there
is
to
take
place
an
alteration
in
the
whole
range
and
scale
of
his
nature
mercifully
he
has
never
far
to
look
for
safeguards
of
the
immediate
and
small
and
common
and
momentary
things
of
life
of
usages
and
observances
and
modes
and
conventions
he
builds
up
fortifications
against
the
powers
of
darkness
he
is
even
content
that
not
terror
only
but
joy
also
should
for
working
purposes
be
placed
in
the
category
of
the
absolute
things
and
the
last
treason
he
will
commit
will
be
that
breaking
down
of
terms
and
limits
that
strikes
not
at
one
man
but
at
the
welfare
of
the
souls
of
all
in
his
own
person
oleron
began
to
commit
this
treason
he
began
to
commit
it
by
admitting
the
inexplicable
and
horrible
to
an
increasing
familiarity
he
did
it
insensibly
unconsciously
by
a
neglect
of
the
things
that
he
now
regarded
it
as
an
impertinence
in
elsie
bengough
to
have
prescribed
two
months
before
the
words
a
haunted
house
applied
to
his
lovely
bemusing
dwelling
would
have
chilled
his
marrow
now
his
scale
of
sensation
becoming
depressed
he
could
ask
haunted
by
what
and
remain
unconscious
that
horror
when
it
can
be
proved
to
be
relative
by
so
much
loses
its
proper
quality
he
was
setting
aside
the
landmarks
mists
and
confusion
had
begun
to
enwrap
him
and
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
a
voracious
inquisitiveness
he
wanted
he
was
resolved
to
know
nothing
but
the
knowledge
would
satisfy
him
and
craftily
he
cast
about
for
means
whereby
he
might
attain
it
he
might
have
spared
his
craft
the
matter
was
the
easiest
imaginable
as
in
time
past
he
had
known
in
his
writing
moments
when
his
thoughts
had
seemed
to
rise
of
themselves
and
to
embody
themselves
in
words
not
to
be
altered
afterwards
so
now
the
questions
he
put
himself
seemed
to
be
answered
even
in
the
moment
of
their
asking
there
was
exhilaration
in
the
swift
easy
processes
he
had
known
no
so
such
joy
in
his
own
power
since
the
days
when
his
writing
had
been
a
daily
freshness
and
a
delight
to
him
it
was
almost
as
if
the
course
he
must
pursue
was
being
dictated
to
him
and
the
first
thing
he
must
do
of
course
was
to
define
the
problem
he
defined
it
in
terms
of
mathematics
granted
that
he
had
not
the
place
to
himself
granted
that
the
old
house
had
inexpressibly
caught
and
engaged
his
spirit
granted
that
by
virtue
of
the
common
denominator
of
the
place
this
unknown
stood
in
some
relation
to
himself
what
next
clearly
the
nature
of
the
other
numerator
must
be
ascertained
and
how
ordinarily
this
would
not
have
seemed
simple
but
to
oleron
it
was
now
pellucidly
clear
the
key
lay
in
his
novel
or
rather
in
both
the
old
and
the
proposed
new
one
a
little
while
before
oleron
would
have
thought
himself
mad
to
have
embraced
such
an
opinion
now
he
accepted
the
dizzying
hypothesis
without
a
quiver
he
began
to
examine
the
first
and
second
from
the
moment
of
his
doing
so
the
thing
advanced
by
leaps
and
bounds
swiftly
he
reviewed
the
history
of
the
of
the
fifteen
chapters
he
remembered
clearly
now
that
he
had
found
her
insufficient
on
the
very
first
morning
on
which
he
had
sat
down
to
work
in
his
new
place
other
instances
of
his
aversion
leaped
up
to
confirm
his
obscure
investigation
there
had
come
the
night
when
he
had
hardly
forborne
to
throw
the
whole
thing
into
the
fire
and
the
next
morning
he
had
begun
the
planning
of
the
new
it
had
been
on
that
morning
that
barrett
overhearing
him
humming
a
brief
phrase
that
the
dripping
of
a
tap
the
night
before
had
suggested
had
informed
him
that
he
was
singing
some
air
he
had
never
in
his
life
heard
before
called
the
beckoning
fair
the
beckoning
fair
one
with
scarcely
a
pause
in
thought
he
continued
the
first
having
been
definitely
thrown
over
the
second
had
instantly
fastened
herself
upon
him
clamouring
for
birth
in
his
brain
he
even
fancied
now
looking
back
that
there
had
been
something
like
passion
hate
almost
in
the
supplanting
and
that
more
than
once
a
stray
thought
given
to
his
discarded
creation
had
it
was
astonishing
how
credible
oleron
found
the
almost
unthinkable
idea
had
offended
the
supplanter
yet
that
a
malignancy
almost
homicidal
should
be
extended
to
his
fiction
poor
mortal
prototype
in
spite
of
his
inuring
to
a
scale
in
which
the
horrible
was
now
a
thing
to
be
fingered
and
turned
this
way
and
that
a
good
god
broke
from
oleron
this
intrusion
of
the
first
prototype
into
his
thought
again
was
a
factor
that
for
the
moment
brought
his
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
his
problem
to
a
termination
the
mere
thought
of
elsie
was
fatal
to
anything
abstract
for
another
thing
he
could
not
yet
think
of
that
letter
of
barrett
nor
of
a
little
scene
that
had
followed
it
without
a
mounting
of
colour
and
a
quick
contraction
of
the
brow
for
wisely
or
not
he
had
had
that
argument
out
at
once
striding
across
the
square
on
the
following
morning
he
had
bearded
barrett
on
his
own
doorstep
coming
back
again
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
been
strongly
of
opinion
that
he
had
only
made
matters
worse
the
man
had
been
vagueness
itself
he
had
not
been
to
be
either
challenged
or
browbeaten
into
anything
more
definite
than
a
muttered
farrago
in
which
the
words
certain
things
barrett
respectable
house
if
the
cap
fits
proceedings
that
shall
be
nameless
had
been
constantly
repeated
not
that
i
make
any
charge
he
had
concluded
charge
oleron
had
cried
i
my
idears
of
things
as
i
do
doubt
you
yours
ideas
mine
oleron
had
cried
wrathfully
immediately
dropping
his
voice
as
heads
had
appeared
at
windows
of
the
square
look
you
here
my
man
you
an
unwholesome
mind
which
probably
you
ca
help
but
a
tongue
which
you
can
help
and
shall
if
there
is
a
breath
of
this
repeated
i
not
be
talked
to
on
my
own
doorstep
like
this
by
anybody
barrett
had
blustered
you
shall
and
i
doing
it
do
you
forget
there
a
gawd
above
all
who
said
you
a
low
scandalmonger
and
so
forth
continuing
badly
what
was
already
badly
begun
oleron
had
returned
wrathfully
to
his
own
house
and
thenceforward
looking
out
of
his
windows
had
seen
barrett
face
at
odd
times
lifting
blinds
or
peering
round
curtains
as
if
he
sought
to
put
himself
in
possession
of
heaven
knew
what
evidence
in
case
it
should
be
required
of
him
the
unfortunate
occurrence
made
certain
minor
differences
in
domestic
arrangements
barrett
tongue
he
gathered
had
already
been
busy
he
was
looked
at
askance
by
the
dwellers
of
the
square
and
he
judged
it
better
until
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
other
help
to
make
his
purchases
of
provisions
a
little
farther
afield
rather
than
at
the
small
shops
of
the
immediate
neighbourhood
for
the
rest
housekeeping
was
no
new
thing
to
him
and
he
would
resume
his
old
bachelor
habits
besides
he
was
deep
in
certain
rather
abstruse
investigations
in
which
it
was
better
that
he
should
not
be
disturbed
he
was
looking
out
of
his
window
one
midday
rather
tired
not
very
well
and
glad
that
it
was
not
very
likely
he
would
have
to
stir
out
of
doors
when
he
saw
elsie
bengough
crossing
the
square
towards
his
house
the
weather
had
broken
it
was
a
raw
and
gusty
day
and
she
had
to
force
her
way
against
the
wind
that
set
her
ample
skirts
bellying
about
her
opulent
figure
and
her
veil
spinning
and
streaming
behind
her
oleron
acted
swiftly
and
instinctively
seizing
his
hat
he
sprang
to
the
door
and
descended
the
stairs
at
a
run
a
sort
of
panic
had
seized
him
she
must
be
prevented
from
setting
foot
in
the
place
as
he
ran
along
the
alley
he
was
conscious
that
his
eyes
went
up
to
the
eaves
as
if
something
drew
them
he
did
not
know
that
a
slate
might
not
accidentally
fall
he
met
her
at
the
gate
and
spoke
with
curious
volubleness
this
is
really
too
bad
elsie
just
as
i
urgently
called
away
afraid
it
ca
be
helped
though
and
that
you
have
to
think
me
an
inhospitable
beast
he
poured
it
out
just
as
it
came
into
his
head
she
asked
if
he
was
going
to
town
yes
yes
to
town
he
replied
i
got
to
call
on
on
chambers
you
know
chambers
do
you
no
i
remember
you
do
a
big
man
you
once
saw
me
with
i
ought
to
have
gone
yesterday
and
this
he
felt
to
be
a
brilliant
effort
and
he
going
out
of
town
this
afternoon
to
brighton
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
he
took
her
arm
and
led
her
up
the
square
she
had
to
remind
him
that
his
way
to
town
lay
in
the
other
direction
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
he
said
with
a
little
loud
laugh
i
so
used
to
going
the
other
way
with
you
of
course
it
the
other
way
to
the
bus
will
you
come
along
with
me
i
am
so
awfully
sorry
it
happened
like
this
they
took
the
street
to
the
bus
terminus
this
time
elsie
bore
no
signs
of
having
gone
through
interior
struggles
if
she
detected
anything
unusual
in
his
manner
she
made
no
comment
and
he
seeing
her
calm
began
to
talk
less
recklessly
through
silences
by
the
time
they
reached
the
bus
terminus
nobody
seeing
the
man
without
an
overcoat
and
the
large
girl
at
his
side
would
have
supposed
that
one
of
them
was
ready
to
sink
on
his
knees
for
thankfulness
that
he
had
as
he
believed
saved
the
other
from
a
wildly
unthinkable
danger
they
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
bus
oleron
protesting
that
he
should
not
miss
his
overcoat
and
that
he
found
the
day
if
anything
rather
oppressively
hot
they
sat
down
on
a
front
seat
now
that
this
meeting
was
forced
upon
him
he
had
something
else
to
say
that
would
make
demands
upon
his
tact
it
had
been
on
his
mind
for
some
time
and
was
indeed
peculiarly
difficult
to
put
he
revolved
it
for
some
minutes
and
then
remembering
the
success
of
his
story
of
a
sudden
call
to
town
cut
the
knot
of
his
difficulty
with
another
lie
i
thinking
of
going
away
for
a
little
while
elsie
he
said
she
merely
said
oh
somewhere
for
a
change
i
need
a
change
i
think
i
shall
go
or
the
day
after
yes
i
think
yes
she
replied
i
do
quite
know
how
long
i
shall
be
he
continued
i
shall
have
to
let
you
know
when
i
am
back
yes
let
me
know
she
replied
in
an
even
tone
the
tone
was
for
her
suspiciously
even
he
was
a
little
uneasy
you
do
ask
me
where
i
going
he
said
with
a
little
cumbrous
effort
to
rally
her
she
was
looking
straight
before
her
past
the
i
know
she
said
he
was
startled
how
you
know
you
not
going
anywhere
she
replied
he
found
not
a
word
to
say
it
was
a
minute
or
so
before
she
continued
in
the
same
controlled
voice
she
had
employed
from
the
start
you
not
going
anywhere
you
were
going
out
this
morning
you
only
came
out
because
i
appeared
do
behave
as
if
we
were
strangers
paul
a
flush
of
pink
had
mounted
to
his
cheeks
he
noticed
that
the
wind
had
given
her
the
pink
of
early
rhubarb
still
he
found
nothing
to
say
of
course
you
ought
to
go
away
she
continued
i
do
know
whether
you
look
at
yourself
often
in
the
glass
but
you
rather
noticeable
several
people
have
turned
to
look
at
you
this
morning
so
of
course
you
ought
to
go
away
but
you
wo
and
i
know
why
he
shivered
coughed
a
little
and
then
broke
silence
then
if
you
know
there
no
use
in
continuing
this
discussion
he
said
curtly
not
for
me
perhaps
but
there
is
for
you
she
replied
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
know
no
he
said
in
a
voice
slightly
raised
no
she
asked
her
round
eyes
earnestly
on
him
no
again
he
was
getting
out
of
patience
with
her
again
he
was
conscious
of
the
strain
her
devotion
and
fidelity
and
love
plagued
him
she
was
only
humiliating
both
herself
and
him
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
had
he
ever
by
word
or
deed
given
her
cause
for
thus
fastening
herself
on
him
but
there
that
was
the
worst
of
that
kind
of
life
for
a
woman
women
such
as
she
business
women
in
and
out
of
offices
all
the
time
always
whether
they
realised
it
or
not
made
comradeship
a
cover
for
something
else
they
accepted
the
unconventional
status
came
and
went
freely
as
men
did
were
honestly
taken
by
men
at
their
own
valuation
and
then
it
turned
out
to
be
the
other
thing
after
all
and
they
went
and
fell
in
love
no
wonder
there
was
gossip
in
shops
and
squares
and
public
houses
in
a
sense
the
gossipers
were
in
the
right
of
it
independent
yet
not
efficient
with
some
of
womanhood
graces
forgone
and
yet
with
all
the
woman
hunger
and
need
half
sophisticated
yet
not
wise
oleron
was
tired
of
it
all
and
it
was
time
he
told
her
so
i
suppose
he
said
tremblingly
looking
down
between
his
knees
i
suppose
the
real
trouble
is
in
the
life
women
who
earn
their
own
living
are
obliged
to
lead
he
could
not
tell
in
what
sense
she
took
the
lame
generality
she
merely
replied
i
suppose
so
it
ca
be
helped
he
continued
but
you
do
sacrifice
a
good
deal
she
agreed
a
good
deal
and
then
she
added
after
a
moment
what
for
instance
you
may
or
may
not
be
gradually
attaining
a
new
status
but
you
in
a
false
position
it
was
very
likely
she
said
she
had
thought
of
it
much
in
that
light
and
he
continued
desperately
you
bound
to
suffer
your
most
innocent
acts
are
misunderstood
motives
you
never
dreamed
of
are
attributed
to
you
and
in
the
end
it
comes
to
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
took
the
plunge
to
the
sidelong
look
and
the
leer
she
took
his
meaning
with
perfect
ease
she
merely
shivered
a
little
as
she
pronounced
the
name
barrett
his
silence
told
her
the
rest
anything
further
that
was
to
be
said
must
come
from
her
it
came
as
the
bus
stopped
at
a
stage
and
fresh
passengers
mounted
the
stairs
you
better
get
down
here
and
go
back
paul
she
said
i
understand
perfectly
perfectly
it
is
barrett
you
be
able
to
deal
with
barrett
it
merely
convenient
for
you
to
say
it
barrett
i
know
what
it
is
but
you
said
i
was
to
tell
you
that
very
well
but
before
you
go
let
me
tell
you
why
i
came
up
this
morning
in
a
dull
tone
he
asked
her
why
again
she
looked
straight
before
her
as
she
replied
i
came
to
force
your
hand
things
could
go
on
as
they
have
been
going
you
know
and
now
that
all
over
all
over
he
repeated
stupidly
all
over
i
want
you
now
to
consider
yourself
as
far
as
i
concerned
perfectly
free
i
make
only
one
reservation
he
hardly
had
the
spirit
to
ask
her
what
that
was
if
merely
need
she
said
please
do
give
that
a
thought
that
nothing
i
sha
come
near
for
that
but
she
dropped
her
voice
if
in
need
of
paul
i
shall
know
if
you
are
you
will
then
i
shall
come
at
no
matter
what
cost
you
understand
that
he
could
only
groan
so
that
understood
she
concluded
and
i
think
that
all
now
go
back
i
should
advise
you
to
walk
back
for
you
shivering
she
gave
him
a
cold
hand
and
he
descended
he
turned
on
the
edge
of
the
kerb
as
the
bus
started
again
for
the
first
time
in
all
the
years
he
had
known
her
she
parted
from
him
with
no
smile
and
no
wave
of
her
long
arm
ix
he
stood
on
the
kerb
plunged
in
misery
looking
after
her
as
long
as
she
remained
in
sight
but
almost
instantly
with
her
disappearance
he
felt
the
heaviness
lift
a
little
from
his
spirit
she
had
given
him
his
liberty
true
there
was
a
sense
in
which
he
had
never
parted
with
it
but
now
was
no
time
for
splitting
hairs
he
was
free
to
act
and
all
was
clear
ahead
swiftly
the
sense
of
lightness
grew
on
him
it
became
a
positive
rejoicing
in
his
liberty
and
before
he
was
halfway
home
he
had
decided
what
must
be
done
next
the
vicar
of
the
parish
in
which
his
dwelling
was
situated
lived
within
ten
minutes
of
the
square
to
his
house
oleron
turned
his
steps
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
have
all
the
information
he
could
get
about
this
old
house
with
the
insurance
marks
and
the
sloping
to
let
boards
and
the
vicar
was
the
person
most
likely
to
be
able
to
furnish
it
this
last
preliminary
out
of
the
way
and
aha
oleron
chuckled
things
might
be
expected
to
happen
but
he
gained
less
information
than
he
had
hoped
for
the
house
the
vicar
said
was
old
but
there
needed
no
vicar
to
tell
oleron
that
it
was
reputed
oleron
pricked
up
his
ears
to
be
haunted
but
there
were
few
old
houses
about
which
some
such
rumour
did
not
circulate
among
the
ignorant
and
the
deplorable
lack
of
faith
of
the
modern
world
the
vicar
thought
did
not
tend
to
dissipate
these
superstitions
for
the
rest
his
manner
was
the
soothing
manner
of
one
who
prefers
not
to
make
statements
without
knowing
how
they
will
be
taken
by
his
hearer
oleron
smiled
as
he
perceived
this
you
may
leave
my
nerves
out
of
the
question
he
said
how
long
has
the
place
been
empty
a
dozen
years
i
should
say
the
vicar
replied
and
the
last
tenant
did
you
know
him
or
her
oleron
was
conscious
of
a
tingling
of
his
nerves
as
he
offered
the
vicar
the
alternative
of
sex
him
said
the
vicar
a
man
if
i
remember
rightly
his
name
was
madley
an
artist
he
was
a
great
recluse
seldom
went
out
of
the
place
and
the
vicar
hesitated
and
then
broke
into
a
little
gush
of
candour
and
since
you
appear
to
have
come
for
this
information
and
since
it
is
better
that
the
truth
should
be
told
than
that
garbled
versions
should
get
about
i
do
mind
saying
that
this
man
madley
died
there
under
somewhat
unusual
circumstances
it
was
ascertained
at
the
that
there
was
not
a
particle
of
food
in
his
stomach
although
he
was
found
to
be
not
without
money
and
his
frame
was
simply
worn
out
suicide
was
spoken
of
but
you
agree
with
me
that
deliberate
starvation
is
to
say
the
least
an
uncommon
form
of
suicide
an
open
verdict
was
returned
ah
said
oleron
does
there
happen
to
be
any
comprehensive
history
of
this
parish
no
partial
ones
only
i
myself
am
not
guiltless
of
having
made
a
number
of
notes
on
its
purely
ecclesiastical
history
its
registers
and
so
forth
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
you
if
you
would
care
to
see
them
but
it
is
a
large
parish
i
have
only
one
curate
and
my
leisure
as
you
will
readily
understand
the
extent
of
the
parish
and
the
scantiness
of
the
vicar
leisure
occupied
the
remainder
of
the
interview
and
oleron
thanked
the
vicar
took
his
leave
and
walked
slowly
home
he
walked
slowly
for
a
reason
twice
turning
away
from
the
house
within
a
of
the
gate
and
taking
another
turn
of
twenty
minutes
or
so
he
had
a
very
ticklish
piece
of
work
now
before
him
it
required
the
greatest
mental
concentration
it
was
nothing
less
than
to
bring
his
mind
if
he
might
into
such
a
state
of
unpreoccupation
and
receptivity
that
he
should
see
the
place
as
he
had
seen
it
on
that
morning
when
his
removal
accomplished
he
had
sat
down
to
begin
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
the
first
for
could
he
recapture
that
first
impression
he
now
hoped
for
far
more
from
it
formerly
he
had
carried
no
end
of
mental
lumber
before
the
influence
of
the
place
had
been
able
to
find
him
out
at
all
it
had
had
the
inertia
of
those
dreary
chapters
to
overcome
no
results
had
shown
the
process
had
been
one
of
slow
saturation
charging
filling
up
to
a
brim
but
now
he
was
light
unburdened
rid
at
last
both
of
that
and
of
her
prototype
now
for
the
new
unknown
coy
jealous
bewitching
beckoning
fair
at
two
of
the
afternoon
he
put
his
key
into
the
yale
lock
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
his
fantastic
attempt
was
instantly
and
astonishingly
successful
he
could
have
shouted
with
triumph
as
he
entered
the
room
it
was
as
if
he
had
into
it
once
more
as
in
the
days
when
his
writing
had
had
a
daily
freshness
and
wonder
and
promise
for
him
he
was
conscious
of
that
new
ease
and
mastery
and
exhilaration
and
release
the
air
of
the
place
seemed
to
hold
more
oxygen
as
if
his
own
specific
gravity
had
changed
his
very
tread
seemed
less
ponderable
the
flowers
in
the
bowls
the
fair
proportions
of
the
panels
and
mouldings
the
polished
floor
and
the
lofty
and
faintly
starred
ceiling
fairly
laughed
their
welcome
oleron
actually
laughed
back
and
spoke
aloud
oh
you
pretty
pretty
he
flattered
it
then
he
lay
down
on
his
couch
he
spent
that
afternoon
as
a
convalescent
who
expected
a
dear
visitor
might
have
spent
it
in
a
delicious
vacancy
smiling
now
and
then
as
if
in
his
sleep
and
ever
lifting
drowsy
and
contented
eyes
to
his
alluring
surroundings
he
lay
thus
until
darkness
came
and
with
darkness
the
nocturnal
noises
of
the
old
house
but
if
he
waited
for
any
specific
happening
he
waited
in
vain
he
waited
similarly
in
vain
on
the
morrow
maintaining
though
with
less
ease
that
condition
of
his
mind
nothing
occurred
to
give
it
an
impression
whatever
it
was
which
he
so
patiently
wooed
it
seemed
to
be
both
shy
and
exacting
then
on
the
third
day
he
thought
he
understood
a
look
of
gentle
drollery
and
cunning
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
chuckled
oho
oho
well
if
the
wind
sits
in
quarter
we
must
see
what
else
there
is
to
be
done
what
is
there
now
no
i
wo
send
for
elsie
we
do
need
a
wheel
to
break
the
butterfly
on
we
wo
go
to
those
lengths
my
butterfly
he
was
standing
musing
thumbing
his
lean
jaw
looking
aslant
suddenly
he
crossed
to
his
hall
took
down
his
hat
and
went
out
my
lady
is
coquettish
is
she
well
we
see
what
a
little
neglect
will
do
he
chuckled
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
sought
a
railway
station
got
into
a
train
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
country
oh
yes
oleron
thought
was
the
man
to
deal
with
fair
ones
who
beckoned
and
invited
and
then
took
refuge
in
shyness
and
hanging
back
he
did
not
return
until
after
eleven
that
night
my
fair
beckoner
he
murmured
as
he
walked
along
the
alley
and
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
keys
inside
his
flat
he
was
perfectly
composed
perfectly
deliberate
exceedingly
careful
not
to
give
himself
away
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
intended
to
retire
immediately
he
lighted
only
a
single
candle
and
as
he
set
out
with
it
on
his
nightly
round
he
affected
to
yawn
he
went
first
into
his
kitchen
there
was
a
full
moon
and
a
lozenge
of
moonlight
almost
by
contrast
with
his
lay
on
the
floor
the
window
was
uncurtained
and
he
could
see
the
reflection
of
the
candle
and
faintly
that
of
his
own
face
as
he
moved
about
the
door
of
the
stood
a
little
ajar
and
he
closed
it
before
sitting
down
to
remove
his
boots
on
the
chair
with
the
cushion
made
of
the
folded
from
the
kitchen
he
passed
to
the
bathroom
there
another
slant
of
blue
moonlight
cut
the
windowsill
and
lay
across
the
pipes
on
the
wall
he
visited
his
study
and
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
at
the
silvered
roofs
across
the
square
then
walking
straight
through
his
his
stockinged
feet
making
no
noise
he
entered
his
bedroom
and
put
the
candle
on
the
chest
of
drawers
his
face
all
this
time
wore
no
expression
save
that
of
tiredness
he
had
never
been
wilier
nor
more
alert
his
small
bedroom
fireplace
was
opposite
the
chest
of
drawers
on
which
the
mirror
stood
and
his
bed
and
the
window
occupied
the
remaining
sides
of
the
room
oleron
drew
down
his
blind
took
off
his
coat
and
then
stooped
to
get
his
slippers
from
under
the
bed
he
could
have
given
no
reason
for
the
conviction
but
that
the
manifestation
that
for
two
days
had
been
withheld
was
close
at
hand
he
never
for
an
instant
doubted
nor
though
he
could
not
form
the
faintest
guess
of
the
shape
it
might
take
did
he
experience
fear
startling
or
surprising
it
might
be
he
was
prepared
for
that
but
that
was
all
his
scale
of
sensation
had
become
depressed
his
hand
moved
this
way
and
that
under
the
bed
in
search
of
his
slippers
but
for
all
his
caution
and
method
and
preparedness
his
heart
all
at
once
gave
a
leap
and
a
pause
that
was
almost
horrid
his
hand
had
found
the
slippers
but
he
was
still
on
his
knees
save
for
this
circumstance
he
would
have
fallen
the
bed
was
a
low
one
the
groping
for
the
slippers
accounted
for
the
turn
of
his
head
to
one
side
and
he
was
careful
to
keep
the
attitude
until
he
had
partly
recovered
his
when
presently
he
rose
there
was
a
drop
of
blood
on
his
lower
lip
where
he
had
caught
at
it
with
his
teeth
and
his
watch
had
jerked
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
and
was
dangling
at
the
end
of
its
short
leather
guard
then
before
the
watch
had
ceased
its
little
oscillation
he
was
himself
again
in
the
middle
of
his
mantelpiece
there
stood
a
picture
a
portrait
of
his
grandmother
he
placed
himself
before
this
picture
so
that
he
could
see
in
the
glass
of
it
the
steady
flame
of
the
candle
that
burned
behind
him
on
the
chest
of
drawers
he
could
see
also
in
the
the
little
glancings
of
light
from
the
bevels
and
facets
of
the
objects
about
the
mirror
and
candle
but
he
could
see
more
these
twinklings
and
reflections
and
did
not
change
their
position
but
there
was
one
gleam
that
had
motion
it
was
fainter
than
the
rest
and
it
moved
up
and
down
through
the
air
it
was
the
reflection
of
the
candle
on
oleron
black
vulcanite
comb
and
each
of
its
downward
movements
was
accompanied
by
a
silky
and
crackling
rustle
oleron
watching
what
went
on
in
the
glass
of
his
grandmother
portrait
continued
to
play
his
part
he
felt
for
his
dangling
watch
and
began
slowly
to
wind
it
up
then
for
a
moment
ceasing
to
watch
he
began
to
empty
his
trousers
pockets
and
to
place
methodically
in
a
little
row
on
the
mantelpiece
the
pennies
and
halfpennies
he
took
from
them
the
sweeping
minutely
electric
noise
filled
the
whole
bedroom
and
had
oleron
altered
his
point
of
observation
he
could
have
brought
the
dim
gleam
of
the
moving
comb
so
into
position
that
it
would
almost
have
outlined
his
grandmother
head
any
other
head
of
which
it
might
have
been
following
the
outline
was
invisible
oleron
finished
the
emptying
of
his
pockets
then
under
cover
of
another
simulated
yawn
not
so
much
summoning
his
resolution
as
overmastered
by
an
exhorbitant
curiosity
he
swung
suddenly
round
that
which
was
being
combed
was
still
not
to
be
seen
but
the
comb
did
not
stop
it
had
altered
its
angle
a
little
and
had
moved
a
little
to
the
left
it
was
passing
in
fairly
regular
sweeps
from
a
point
rather
more
than
five
feet
from
the
ground
in
a
direction
roughly
vertical
to
another
point
a
few
inches
below
the
level
of
the
chest
of
drawers
oleron
continued
to
act
to
admiration
he
walked
to
his
little
washstand
in
the
corner
poured
out
water
and
began
to
wash
his
hands
he
removed
his
waistcoat
and
continued
his
preparations
for
bed
the
combing
did
not
cease
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
thought
again
his
eyes
twinkled
the
next
was
very
cunning
hm
think
i
read
for
a
quarter
of
an
he
said
aloud
he
passed
out
of
the
room
he
was
away
a
couple
of
minutes
when
he
returned
again
the
room
was
suddenly
quiet
he
glanced
at
the
chest
of
drawers
the
comb
lay
still
between
the
collar
he
had
removed
and
a
pair
of
gloves
without
hesitation
oleron
put
out
his
hand
and
picked
it
up
it
was
an
ordinary
eighteenpenny
comb
taken
from
a
card
in
a
chemist
shop
of
a
substance
of
a
definite
specific
gravity
and
no
more
capable
of
rebellion
against
the
laws
by
which
it
existed
than
are
the
worlds
that
keep
their
orbits
through
the
void
oleron
put
it
down
again
then
he
glanced
at
the
bundle
of
papers
he
held
in
his
hand
what
he
had
gone
to
fetch
had
been
the
fifteen
chapters
of
the
original
hm
he
muttered
as
he
threw
the
manuscript
into
a
chair
as
i
thought
she
just
blindly
ragingly
murderously
jealous
on
the
night
after
that
and
on
the
following
night
and
for
many
nights
and
days
so
many
that
he
began
to
be
uncertain
about
the
count
of
them
oleron
courting
cajoling
neglecting
threatening
beseeching
eaten
out
with
unappeased
curiosity
and
regardless
that
his
life
was
becoming
one
consuming
passion
and
desire
continued
his
search
for
the
unknown
of
his
abode
x
as
time
went
on
it
came
to
pass
that
few
except
the
postman
mounted
oleron
stairs
and
since
men
who
do
not
write
letters
receive
few
even
the
postman
tread
became
so
infrequent
that
it
was
not
heard
more
than
once
or
twice
a
week
there
came
a
letter
from
oleron
publishers
asking
when
they
might
expect
to
receive
the
manuscript
of
his
new
book
he
delayed
for
some
days
to
answer
it
and
finally
forgot
it
a
second
letter
came
which
also
he
failed
to
answer
he
received
no
third
the
weather
grew
bright
and
warm
the
privet
bushes
among
the
flowered
and
in
the
streets
where
oleron
did
his
shopping
the
baskets
of
lined
the
kerbs
oleron
purchased
flowers
daily
his
room
clamoured
for
flowers
fresh
and
continually
renewed
and
oleron
did
not
stint
its
demands
nevertheless
the
necessity
for
going
out
to
buy
them
began
to
irk
him
more
and
more
and
it
was
with
a
greater
and
ever
greater
sense
of
relief
that
he
returned
home
again
he
began
to
be
conscious
that
again
his
scale
of
sensation
had
suffered
a
subtle
change
a
change
that
was
not
restoration
to
its
former
capacity
but
an
extension
and
enlarging
that
once
more
included
terror
it
admitted
it
in
an
entirely
new
form
orco
tenebrae
the
name
of
this
terror
was
agoraphobia
oleron
had
begun
to
dread
air
and
space
and
the
horror
that
might
pounce
upon
the
unguarded
back
presently
he
so
contrived
it
that
his
food
and
flowers
were
delivered
daily
at
his
door
he
rubbed
his
hands
when
he
had
hit
upon
this
expedient
that
was
better
now
he
could
please
himself
whether
he
went
out
or
not
quickly
he
was
confirmed
in
his
choice
it
became
his
pleasure
to
remain
immured
but
he
was
not
happy
or
if
he
was
his
happiness
took
an
extraordinary
turn
he
fretted
discontentedly
could
sometimes
have
wept
for
mere
weakness
and
misery
and
yet
he
was
dimly
conscious
that
he
would
not
have
exchanged
his
sadness
for
all
the
noisy
mirth
of
the
world
outside
and
speaking
of
noise
noise
much
noise
now
caused
him
the
acutest
discomfort
it
was
hardly
more
to
be
endured
than
that
fear
that
kept
him
on
the
increasingly
rare
occasions
when
he
did
go
out
sidling
close
to
walls
and
feeling
friendly
railings
with
his
hand
he
moved
from
room
to
room
softly
and
in
slippers
and
sometimes
stood
for
many
seconds
closing
a
door
so
gently
that
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
that
was
in
itself
a
delight
sunday
now
became
an
intolerable
day
to
him
for
since
the
coming
of
the
fine
weather
there
had
begun
to
assemble
in
the
square
under
his
windows
each
sunday
morning
certain
members
of
the
sect
to
which
the
barrett
adhered
these
came
with
a
great
drum
and
large
instruments
men
and
women
uplifted
anguished
voices
struggling
with
their
god
and
barrett
himself
with
upraised
face
and
closed
eyes
and
working
brows
prayed
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
might
penetrate
the
ears
of
all
unbelievers
as
it
certainly
did
oleron
one
day
in
the
middle
of
one
of
these
rhapsodies
oleron
sprang
to
his
blind
and
pulled
it
down
and
heard
as
he
did
so
his
own
name
made
the
subject
of
a
fresh
torrent
of
outpouring
and
sometimes
but
not
as
expecting
a
reply
oleron
stood
still
and
called
softly
once
or
twice
he
called
romilly
and
then
waited
but
more
often
his
whispering
did
not
take
the
shape
of
a
name
there
was
one
spot
in
particular
of
his
abode
that
he
began
to
haunt
with
increasing
persistency
this
was
just
within
the
opening
of
his
bedroom
door
he
had
discovered
one
day
that
by
opening
every
door
in
his
place
always
excepting
the
outer
one
which
he
only
opened
unwillingly
and
by
placing
himself
on
this
particular
spot
he
could
actually
see
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
into
each
of
his
five
rooms
without
changing
his
position
he
could
see
the
whole
of
his
all
of
his
bedroom
except
the
part
hidden
by
the
open
door
and
glimpses
of
his
kitchen
bathroom
and
of
his
rarely
used
study
he
was
often
in
this
place
breathless
and
with
his
finger
on
his
lip
one
day
as
he
stood
there
he
suddenly
found
himself
wondering
whether
this
madley
of
whom
the
vicar
had
spoken
had
ever
discovered
the
strategic
importance
of
the
bedroom
entry
light
moreover
now
caused
him
greater
disquietude
than
did
darkness
direct
sunlight
of
which
as
the
sun
passed
daily
round
the
house
each
of
his
rooms
had
now
its
share
was
like
a
flame
in
his
brain
and
even
diffused
light
was
a
dull
and
numbing
ache
he
began
at
successive
hours
of
the
day
one
after
another
to
lower
his
crimson
blinds
he
made
short
and
daring
excursions
in
order
to
do
this
but
he
was
ever
careful
to
leave
his
retreat
open
in
case
he
should
have
sudden
need
of
it
presently
this
lowering
of
the
blinds
had
become
a
daily
methodical
exercise
and
his
rooms
when
he
had
been
his
round
had
the
of
a
photographer
darkroom
one
day
as
he
drew
down
the
blind
of
his
little
study
and
backed
in
good
order
out
of
the
room
again
he
broke
into
a
soft
laugh
bilks
mr
barrett
he
said
and
the
baffling
of
barrett
continued
to
afford
him
mirth
for
an
hour
but
on
another
day
soon
after
he
had
a
fright
that
left
him
trembling
also
for
an
hour
he
had
seized
the
cord
to
darken
the
window
over
the
seat
in
which
he
had
found
the
and
was
standing
with
his
back
well
protected
in
the
embrasure
when
he
thought
he
saw
the
tail
of
a
check
skirt
disappear
round
the
corner
of
the
house
he
could
not
be
sure
had
he
run
to
the
window
of
the
other
wall
which
was
blinded
the
skirt
must
have
been
already
past
but
he
was
sure
that
it
was
elsie
he
listened
in
an
agony
of
suspense
for
her
tread
on
the
stairs
but
no
tread
came
and
after
three
or
four
minutes
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
by
jove
but
that
would
have
compromised
me
horribly
he
muttered
and
he
continued
to
mutter
from
time
to
time
horribly
compromising
woman
would
stand
that
not
kind
of
woman
oh
compromising
in
the
extreme
yet
he
was
not
happy
he
could
not
have
assigned
the
cause
of
the
fits
of
quiet
weeping
which
took
him
sometimes
they
came
and
went
like
the
fitful
illumination
of
the
clouds
that
travelled
over
the
square
and
perhaps
after
all
if
he
was
not
happy
he
was
not
unhappy
before
he
could
be
unhappy
something
must
have
been
withdrawn
and
nothing
had
yet
been
withdrawn
from
him
for
nothing
had
been
granted
he
was
waiting
for
that
granting
in
that
frightfully
enticing
apartment
of
his
with
the
walls
tinged
and
subdued
by
the
crimson
blinds
to
a
gloom
he
paid
no
heed
to
it
that
his
stock
of
money
was
running
perilously
low
nor
that
he
had
ceased
to
work
ceased
to
work
he
had
not
ceased
to
work
they
knew
very
little
about
it
who
supposed
that
oleron
had
ceased
to
work
he
was
in
truth
only
now
beginning
to
work
he
was
preparing
such
a
work
such
a
work
such
a
mistress
was
in
the
gestation
of
his
art
let
him
but
get
this
period
of
probation
and
poignant
waiting
over
and
men
should
see
how
men
know
her
this
fair
one
of
oleron
until
oleron
himself
knew
her
lovely
radiant
creations
are
not
thrown
off
like
d
the
men
to
whom
it
is
committed
to
father
them
must
weep
wretched
tears
as
oleron
did
must
swell
with
vain
presumptuous
hopes
as
oleron
did
must
pursue
as
oleron
pursued
the
capricious
fair
mocking
slippery
eager
spirit
that
ever
eluding
ever
sees
to
it
that
the
chase
does
not
slacken
let
oleron
but
hunt
this
huntress
a
little
longer
he
would
have
her
sparkling
and
panting
in
his
arms
yet
oh
no
they
were
very
far
from
the
truth
who
supposed
that
oleron
had
ceased
to
work
and
if
all
else
was
falling
away
from
oleron
gladly
he
was
letting
it
go
so
do
we
all
when
our
fair
ones
beckon
quite
at
the
beginning
we
wink
and
promise
ourselves
that
we
will
put
her
ladyship
through
her
paces
neglect
her
for
a
day
turn
her
own
jealous
wiles
against
her
flout
and
ignore
her
when
she
comes
wheedling
perhaps
there
lurks
within
us
all
the
time
a
heartless
sprite
who
is
never
fooled
but
in
the
end
all
falls
away
she
beckons
beckons
and
all
goes
and
so
oleron
kept
his
strategic
post
within
the
frame
of
his
bedroom
door
and
watched
and
waited
and
smiled
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
it
was
his
duteous
service
his
worship
his
all
that
he
had
ever
known
of
love
and
when
he
found
himself
as
he
now
and
then
did
hating
the
dead
man
madley
and
wishing
that
he
had
never
lived
he
felt
that
that
too
was
an
acceptable
service
but
as
he
thus
prepared
himself
as
it
were
for
a
marriage
and
moped
and
chafed
more
and
more
that
the
bride
made
no
sign
he
made
a
discovery
that
he
ought
to
have
made
weeks
before
it
was
through
a
thought
of
the
dead
madley
that
he
made
it
since
that
night
when
he
had
thought
in
his
greenness
that
a
little
studied
neglect
would
bring
the
lovely
beckoner
to
her
knees
and
had
made
use
of
her
own
jealousy
to
banish
her
he
had
not
set
eyes
on
those
fifteen
discarded
chapters
of
he
had
thrown
them
back
into
the
forgotten
their
very
existence
but
his
own
jealousy
of
madley
put
him
in
mind
of
hers
of
her
jilted
rival
of
flesh
and
blood
and
he
remembered
them
fool
that
he
had
been
had
he
then
expected
his
desire
to
manifest
herself
while
there
still
existed
the
evidence
of
his
divided
allegiance
what
and
she
with
a
passion
so
fierce
and
centred
that
it
had
not
hesitated
at
the
destruction
twice
attempted
of
her
rival
fool
that
he
had
been
but
if
was
all
the
pledge
and
sacrifice
she
required
she
should
have
it
ah
yes
and
quickly
he
took
the
manuscript
from
the
and
brought
it
to
the
fire
he
kept
his
fire
always
burning
now
the
warmth
brought
out
the
last
vestige
of
odour
of
the
flowers
with
which
his
room
was
banked
he
did
not
know
what
time
it
was
long
since
he
had
allowed
his
clock
to
run
down
it
had
seemed
a
foolish
measurer
of
time
in
regard
to
the
stupendous
things
that
were
happening
to
oleron
but
he
knew
it
was
late
he
took
the
manuscript
and
knelt
before
the
fire
but
he
had
not
finished
removing
the
fastening
that
held
the
sheets
together
before
he
suddenly
gave
a
start
turned
his
head
over
his
shoulder
and
listened
intently
the
sound
he
had
heard
had
not
been
loud
it
had
been
indeed
no
more
than
a
tap
twice
or
thrice
repeated
but
it
had
filled
oleron
with
alarm
his
face
grew
dark
as
it
came
again
he
heard
a
voice
outside
on
his
landing
paul
paul
it
was
elsie
voice
paul
i
know
you
in
i
want
to
see
you
he
cursed
her
under
his
breath
but
kept
perfectly
still
he
did
not
intend
to
admit
her
paul
you
in
trouble
i
believe
you
in
danger
at
least
come
to
the
door
oleron
smothered
a
low
laugh
it
somehow
amused
him
that
she
in
such
danger
herself
should
talk
to
him
of
danger
well
if
she
was
serve
her
right
she
knew
or
said
she
knew
all
about
it
paul
paul
paul
he
mimicked
her
under
his
breath
oh
paul
it
horrible
was
it
thought
oleron
then
let
her
get
away
i
only
want
to
help
you
paul
i
did
promise
not
to
come
if
you
needed
me
he
was
impervious
to
the
pitiful
sob
that
interrupted
the
low
cry
the
devil
take
the
woman
should
he
shout
to
her
to
go
away
and
not
come
back
no
let
her
call
and
knock
and
sob
she
had
a
gift
for
sobbing
she
must
think
her
sobs
would
move
him
they
irritated
him
so
that
he
set
his
teeth
and
shook
his
fist
at
her
but
that
was
all
let
her
sob
paul
with
his
teeth
hard
set
he
dropped
the
first
page
of
into
the
fire
then
he
began
to
drop
the
rest
in
sheet
by
sheet
for
many
minutes
the
calling
behind
his
door
continued
then
suddenly
it
ceased
he
heard
the
sound
of
feet
slowly
descending
the
stairs
he
listened
for
the
noise
of
a
fall
or
a
cry
or
the
crash
of
a
piece
of
the
handrail
of
the
upper
landing
but
none
of
these
things
came
she
was
spared
apparently
her
rival
suffered
her
to
crawl
abject
and
beaten
away
oleron
heard
the
passing
of
her
steps
under
his
window
then
she
was
gone
he
dropped
the
last
page
into
the
fire
and
then
with
a
low
laugh
rose
he
looked
fondly
round
his
room
lucky
to
get
away
like
that
he
remarked
she
would
have
got
away
if
i
given
her
as
much
as
a
word
or
a
look
what
devils
these
women
are
but
no
i
ought
to
say
that
one
of
showed
forbearance
who
showed
forbearance
and
what
was
forborne
ah
oleron
knew
contempt
no
doubt
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
that
did
matter
the
pestering
creature
had
been
allowed
to
go
unharmed
yes
she
was
lucky
oleron
hoped
she
knew
it
and
now
now
now
for
his
reward
oleron
crossed
the
room
all
his
doors
were
open
his
eyes
shone
as
he
placed
himself
within
that
of
his
bedroom
fool
that
he
had
been
not
to
think
of
destroying
the
manuscript
sooner
how
in
a
houseful
of
shadows
should
he
know
his
own
shadow
how
in
a
houseful
of
noises
distinguish
the
summons
he
felt
to
be
at
hand
ah
trust
him
he
would
know
the
place
was
full
of
a
jugglery
of
dim
lights
the
blind
at
his
elbow
that
allowed
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
to
struggle
vaguely
through
the
glimpse
of
greeny
blue
moonlight
seen
through
the
distant
kitchen
door
the
sulky
glow
of
the
fire
under
the
black
ashes
of
the
burnt
manuscript
the
glimmering
of
the
tulips
and
the
and
narcissi
in
the
bowls
and
jugs
and
jars
these
did
not
so
trick
and
bewilder
his
eyes
that
he
would
not
know
his
own
it
was
he
not
she
who
had
been
delaying
the
shadowy
bridal
he
hung
his
head
for
a
moment
in
mute
acknowledgment
then
he
bent
his
eyes
on
the
deceiving
puzzling
gloom
again
he
would
have
called
her
name
had
he
known
it
but
now
he
would
not
ask
her
to
share
even
a
name
with
the
other
his
own
face
within
the
frame
of
the
door
glimmered
white
as
the
narcissi
in
the
darkness
a
shadow
light
as
fleece
seemed
to
take
shape
in
the
kitchen
the
time
had
been
when
oleron
would
have
said
that
a
cloud
had
passed
over
the
unseen
moon
the
low
illumination
on
the
blind
at
his
elbow
grew
dimmer
the
time
had
been
when
oleron
would
have
concluded
that
the
lamplighter
going
his
rounds
had
turned
low
the
flame
of
the
lamp
the
fire
settled
letting
down
the
black
and
charred
papers
a
flower
fell
from
a
bowl
and
lay
indistinct
upon
the
floor
all
was
still
and
then
a
stray
draught
moved
through
the
old
house
passing
before
oleron
face
suddenly
inclining
his
head
he
withdrew
a
little
from
the
the
wandering
draught
caused
the
door
to
move
a
little
on
its
hinges
oleron
trembled
violently
stood
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
putting
his
hand
out
to
the
knob
softly
drew
the
door
to
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
waited
as
a
man
might
await
the
calling
of
his
name
that
should
summon
him
to
some
weighty
high
and
privy
audience
xi
one
knows
not
whether
there
can
be
human
compassion
for
anemia
of
the
soul
when
the
pitch
of
life
is
dropped
and
the
spirit
is
so
put
over
and
reversed
that
that
only
is
horrible
which
before
was
sweet
and
worldly
and
of
the
day
the
human
relation
disappears
the
sane
soul
turns
appalled
away
lest
not
merely
itself
but
sanity
should
suffer
we
are
not
gods
we
can
not
drive
out
devils
we
must
see
selfishly
to
it
that
devils
do
not
enter
into
ourselves
and
this
we
must
do
even
though
love
so
transfuse
us
that
we
may
well
deem
our
nature
to
be
half
divine
we
shall
but
speak
of
honour
and
duty
in
vain
the
letter
dropped
within
the
dark
door
will
lie
unregarded
or
if
regarded
for
a
brief
instant
between
two
unspeakable
lapses
left
and
forgotten
again
the
telegram
will
be
undelivered
nor
will
the
whistling
messenger
wiselier
guided
than
he
knows
to
whistle
be
conscious
as
he
walks
away
of
the
drawn
blind
that
is
pushed
aside
an
inch
by
a
finger
and
then
fearfully
replaced
again
no
let
the
miserable
wrestle
with
his
own
shadows
let
him
if
indeed
he
be
so
mad
clip
and
strain
and
enfold
and
couch
the
succubus
but
let
him
do
so
in
a
house
into
which
not
an
air
of
heaven
penetrates
nor
a
bright
finger
of
the
sun
pierces
the
filthy
twilight
the
lost
must
remain
lost
humanity
has
other
business
to
attend
to
for
the
handwriting
of
the
two
letters
that
oleron
stealing
noiselessly
one
june
day
into
his
kitchen
to
rid
his
of
an
armful
of
fetid
and
decaying
flowers
had
seen
on
the
floor
within
his
door
had
had
no
more
meaning
for
him
than
if
it
had
belonged
to
some
dim
and
faraway
dream
and
at
the
beating
of
the
upon
the
door
within
a
few
feet
of
the
bed
where
he
lay
he
had
gnashed
his
teeth
and
stopped
his
ears
he
had
pictured
the
lad
standing
there
just
beyond
his
partition
among
packets
of
provisions
and
bundles
of
dead
and
dying
flowers
for
his
outer
landing
was
littered
with
these
oleron
had
feared
to
open
his
door
to
take
them
in
after
a
week
the
errand
lads
had
reported
that
there
must
be
some
mistake
about
the
order
and
had
left
no
more
inside
in
the
red
twilight
the
old
flowers
turned
brown
and
fell
and
decayed
where
they
lay
gradually
his
power
was
draining
away
the
abomination
fastened
on
oleron
power
the
steady
sapping
sometimes
left
him
for
many
hours
of
prostration
gazing
vacantly
up
at
his
ceiling
idly
suffering
such
fancies
as
came
of
themselves
to
have
their
way
with
him
even
the
strongest
of
his
memories
had
no
more
than
a
precarious
hold
upon
his
attention
sometimes
a
flitting
of
a
novel
to
be
written
a
novel
it
was
important
that
he
should
write
tantalised
him
for
a
space
before
vanishing
again
and
sometimes
whole
novels
perfect
splendid
established
to
endure
rose
magically
before
him
and
sometimes
the
memories
were
absurdly
remote
and
trivial
of
garrets
he
had
inhabited
and
lodgings
that
had
sheltered
him
and
so
forth
oleron
had
known
a
good
deal
about
such
things
in
his
time
but
all
that
was
now
past
he
had
at
last
found
a
place
which
he
did
not
intend
to
leave
until
they
fetched
him
out
a
place
that
some
might
have
thought
a
little
on
the
side
that
others
might
have
considered
to
be
a
little
too
redolent
of
and
morbid
things
for
a
living
man
to
be
mewed
up
in
but
ah
so
irresistible
with
such
an
authority
of
its
own
with
such
an
associate
of
its
own
and
a
place
of
such
delights
when
once
a
man
had
ceased
to
struggle
against
its
inexorable
will
a
novel
somebody
ought
to
write
a
novel
about
a
place
like
that
there
must
be
lots
to
write
about
in
a
place
like
that
if
one
could
but
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
it
had
probably
already
been
painted
by
a
man
called
madley
who
had
lived
there
but
oleron
had
not
known
this
madley
had
a
strong
feeling
that
he
would
have
liked
him
would
rather
he
had
lived
somewhere
else
really
could
stand
the
fellow
hated
him
madley
in
fact
aha
that
was
a
joke
he
seriously
doubted
whether
the
man
had
led
the
life
he
ought
oleron
was
in
two
minds
sometimes
whether
he
would
tell
that
guardian
of
the
public
morals
across
the
way
about
him
but
probably
he
knew
and
had
made
his
praying
hullabaloos
for
him
also
that
was
his
line
why
oleron
himself
had
had
a
with
him
about
something
or
other
some
girl
or
other
elsie
bengough
her
name
was
he
remembered
oleron
had
moments
of
deep
uneasiness
about
this
elsie
bengough
or
rather
he
was
not
so
much
uneasy
about
her
as
restless
about
the
things
she
did
chief
of
these
was
the
way
in
which
she
persisted
in
thrusting
herself
into
his
thoughts
and
whenever
he
was
quick
enough
he
sent
her
packing
the
moment
she
made
her
appearance
there
the
truth
was
that
she
was
not
merely
a
bore
she
had
always
been
that
it
had
now
come
to
the
pitch
when
her
very
presence
in
his
fancy
was
inimical
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
certain
experiences
she
had
no
tact
really
ought
to
have
known
that
people
are
not
at
home
to
the
thoughts
of
everybody
all
the
time
ought
in
mere
politeness
to
have
allowed
him
certain
seasons
quite
to
himself
and
was
monstrously
ignorant
of
things
if
she
did
not
know
as
she
appeared
not
to
know
that
there
were
certain
special
hours
when
a
man
veins
ran
with
fire
and
daring
and
power
in
which
well
in
which
he
had
a
reasonable
right
to
treat
folk
as
he
had
treated
that
prying
barrett
to
shut
them
out
completely
but
no
up
she
popped
the
thought
of
her
and
ruined
all
bright
towering
fabrics
by
the
side
of
which
even
those
perfect
magical
novels
of
which
he
dreamed
were
dun
and
grey
vanished
utterly
at
her
intrusion
it
was
as
if
a
fog
should
suddenly
quench
some
star
as
if
at
the
threshold
of
some
golden
portal
prepared
for
oleron
a
pit
should
suddenly
gape
as
if
a
shadow
should
turn
the
growing
dawn
to
mirk
and
darkness
again
therefore
oleron
strove
to
stifle
even
the
nascent
thought
of
her
nevertheless
there
came
an
occasion
on
which
this
woman
bengough
absolutely
refused
to
be
suppressed
oleron
could
not
have
told
exactly
when
this
happened
he
only
knew
by
the
glimmer
of
the
street
lamp
on
his
blind
that
it
was
some
time
during
the
night
and
that
for
some
time
she
had
not
presented
herself
he
had
no
warning
none
of
her
coming
she
just
came
was
there
strive
as
he
would
he
could
not
shake
off
the
thought
of
her
nor
the
image
of
her
face
she
haunted
him
but
for
her
to
come
at
that
moment
of
all
moments
really
it
was
past
belief
how
she
could
endure
it
oleron
could
not
conceive
actually
to
look
on
as
it
were
at
the
triumph
of
a
rival
good
god
it
was
monstrous
tact
reticence
he
had
never
credited
her
with
an
overwhelming
amount
of
either
but
he
had
never
attributed
mere
oh
there
was
no
word
for
it
monstrous
monstrous
did
she
intend
thenceforward
good
god
to
look
on
oleron
felt
the
blood
rush
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
with
anger
against
her
damnation
take
her
he
choked
but
the
next
moment
his
heat
and
resentment
had
changed
to
a
cold
sweat
of
cowering
fear
he
strove
to
comprehend
what
he
had
done
for
though
he
knew
not
what
he
knew
he
had
done
something
something
fatal
irreparable
blasting
anger
he
had
felt
but
not
blaze
of
ire
that
suddenly
flooded
the
twilight
of
his
consciousness
with
a
white
infernal
light
appalling
flash
was
not
his
not
his
open
rift
of
bright
and
searing
hell
not
his
not
his
his
had
been
the
hand
of
a
child
preparing
a
puny
blow
but
what
was
horrific
hand
that
was
drawn
back
to
strike
in
the
same
place
had
set
that
in
motion
had
provided
the
spark
that
had
touched
off
the
whole
accumulated
power
of
that
formidable
and
relentless
place
he
did
not
know
he
only
knew
that
that
poor
igniting
particle
in
himself
was
blown
out
that
oh
impossible
a
clinging
kiss
how
else
to
express
it
had
changed
on
his
very
lips
to
a
gnashing
and
a
removal
and
that
for
very
pity
of
the
awful
odds
he
must
cry
out
to
her
against
whom
he
had
lately
raged
to
guard
herself
guard
herself
out
he
shrieked
aloud
the
revulsion
was
instant
as
if
a
cold
slow
billow
had
broken
over
him
he
came
to
to
find
that
he
was
lying
in
his
bed
that
the
mist
and
horror
that
had
for
so
long
enwrapped
him
had
departed
that
he
was
paul
oleron
and
that
he
was
sick
naked
helpless
and
unutterably
abandoned
and
alone
his
faculties
though
weak
answered
at
last
to
his
calls
upon
them
and
he
knew
that
it
must
have
been
a
hideous
nightmare
that
had
left
him
sweating
and
shaking
thus
yes
he
was
himself
paul
oleron
a
tired
novelist
already
past
the
summit
of
his
best
work
and
slipping
downhill
again
from
it
all
he
had
struck
short
in
his
life
aim
he
had
tried
too
much
had
his
strength
and
was
a
failure
a
failure
it
all
came
to
him
in
the
single
word
enwrapped
and
complete
it
needed
no
sequential
thought
he
was
a
failure
he
had
missed
and
he
had
missed
not
one
happiness
but
two
he
had
missed
the
ease
of
this
world
which
men
love
and
he
had
missed
also
that
other
shining
prize
for
which
men
forgo
ease
the
snatching
and
holding
and
triumphant
bearing
up
aloft
of
which
is
the
only
justification
of
the
mad
adventurer
who
hazards
the
enterprise
and
there
was
no
second
attempt
fate
has
no
morrow
oleron
morrow
must
be
to
sit
down
to
profitless
unrequired
work
again
and
so
on
the
morrow
after
that
and
the
morrow
after
that
and
as
many
morrows
as
there
might
be
he
lay
there
weakly
yet
sanely
considering
it
and
since
the
whole
attempt
had
failed
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
consider
whether
a
little
might
not
be
saved
from
the
general
wreck
no
good
would
ever
come
of
that
novel
he
had
intended
that
it
should
appear
in
the
autumn
was
under
contract
that
it
should
appear
no
matter
it
was
better
to
pay
forfeit
to
his
publishers
than
to
waste
what
days
were
left
he
was
spent
age
was
not
far
off
and
paths
of
wisdom
and
sadness
were
the
properest
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
if
only
he
had
chosen
the
wife
the
child
the
faithful
friend
at
the
fireside
and
let
them
follow
an
that
list
in
the
meantime
it
began
to
puzzle
him
exceedingly
what
he
should
be
so
weak
that
his
room
should
smell
so
overpoweringly
of
decaying
vegetable
matter
and
that
his
hand
chancing
to
stray
to
his
face
in
the
darkness
should
encounter
a
beard
most
extraordinary
he
began
to
mutter
to
himself
have
i
been
ill
am
i
ill
now
and
if
so
why
have
they
left
me
alone
extraordinary
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
from
the
kitchen
or
bathroom
he
rose
a
little
on
his
pillow
and
listened
ah
he
was
not
alone
then
it
certainly
would
have
been
extraordinary
if
they
had
left
him
ill
and
alone
alone
oh
no
he
would
be
looked
after
he
would
be
left
ill
to
shift
for
himself
if
everybody
else
had
forsaken
him
he
could
trust
elsie
bengough
the
dearest
chum
he
had
for
that
bless
her
faithful
heart
but
suddenly
a
short
stifled
spluttering
cry
rang
sharply
out
it
came
from
the
kitchen
and
in
the
same
moment
it
flashed
upon
oleron
he
knew
not
how
that
two
three
five
he
knew
not
how
many
minutes
before
another
sound
unmarked
at
the
time
but
suddenly
transfixing
his
attention
now
had
striven
to
reach
his
intelligence
this
sound
had
been
the
slight
touch
of
metal
on
metal
just
such
a
sound
as
oleron
made
when
he
put
his
key
into
the
lock
hallo
who
that
he
called
sharply
from
his
bed
he
had
no
answer
he
called
again
hallo
who
there
who
is
it
this
time
he
was
sure
he
heard
noises
soft
and
heavy
in
the
kitchen
this
is
a
queer
thing
altogether
he
muttered
by
jove
i
as
weak
as
a
kitten
too
hallo
there
somebody
called
did
they
elsie
is
that
you
then
he
began
to
knock
with
his
hand
on
the
wall
at
the
side
of
his
bed
elsie
elsie
you
called
did
you
please
come
here
whoever
it
is
there
was
a
sound
as
of
a
closing
door
and
then
silence
oleron
began
to
get
rather
alarmed
it
may
be
a
nurse
he
muttered
elsie
have
to
get
me
a
nurse
of
course
she
sit
with
me
as
long
as
she
could
spare
the
time
brave
lass
and
she
get
a
nurse
for
the
rest
but
it
was
awfully
like
her
voice
elsie
or
whoever
it
is
i
ca
make
this
out
at
all
i
must
go
and
see
what
the
matter
he
put
one
leg
out
of
bed
feeling
its
feebleness
he
reached
with
his
hand
for
the
additional
support
of
the
wall
but
before
putting
out
the
other
leg
he
stopped
and
considered
picking
at
his
beard
he
was
suddenly
wondering
whether
he
go
into
the
kitchen
it
was
such
a
frightfully
long
way
no
man
knew
what
horror
might
not
leap
and
huddle
on
his
shoulders
if
he
went
so
far
when
a
man
has
an
overmastering
impulse
to
get
back
into
bed
he
ought
to
take
heed
of
the
warning
and
obey
it
besides
why
should
he
go
what
was
there
to
go
for
if
it
was
that
bengough
creature
again
let
her
look
after
herself
oleron
was
not
going
to
have
things
cramp
themselves
on
his
defenceless
back
for
the
sake
of
such
a
spoilsport
as
if
she
was
in
let
her
let
herself
out
again
and
the
sooner
the
better
for
her
oleron
simply
could
be
bothered
he
had
his
work
to
do
on
the
morrow
he
must
set
about
the
writing
of
a
novel
with
a
heroine
so
winsome
capricious
adorable
jealous
wicked
beautiful
inflaming
and
altogether
evil
that
men
should
stand
amazed
she
was
coming
over
him
now
he
knew
by
the
alteration
of
the
very
air
of
the
room
when
she
was
near
him
and
that
soft
thrill
of
bliss
that
had
begun
to
stir
in
him
never
came
unless
she
was
beckoning
beckoning
he
let
go
the
wall
and
fell
back
into
bed
again
as
oh
unthinkable
the
other
half
of
that
kiss
that
a
gnash
had
interrupted
was
placed
how
else
convey
it
on
his
lips
robbing
him
of
very
breath
xii
in
the
bright
june
sunlight
a
crowd
filled
the
square
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
of
the
old
house
with
the
antique
insurance
marks
in
its
walls
of
red
brick
and
the
agents
hanging
like
wooden
choppers
over
the
paling
two
constables
stood
at
the
broken
gate
of
the
narrow
keeping
folk
back
the
women
kept
to
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
moving
now
and
then
as
if
to
see
the
drawn
red
blinds
of
the
old
house
from
a
new
angle
and
talking
in
whispers
the
children
were
in
the
houses
behind
closed
doors
a
man
had
a
little
group
about
him
and
he
was
telling
some
story
over
and
over
again
and
another
man
little
and
fat
and
sought
to
capture
the
man
audience
with
some
relation
in
which
a
key
figured
and
it
was
revealed
to
me
that
there
been
something
that
very
afternoon
the
man
was
saying
i
was
standing
there
where
constable
saunders
is
or
rather
i
was
passing
about
my
business
when
they
came
out
there
was
no
deceiving
me
oh
no
deceiving
saw
her
face
what
was
it
like
mr
barrett
a
man
asked
it
was
like
hers
whom
our
lord
said
to
doth
any
man
accuse
thee
white
as
paper
and
no
mistake
do
tell
and
so
i
walks
straight
across
to
barrett
and
i
says
must
stop
and
stop
at
once
we
are
commanded
to
avoid
evil
i
says
it
must
come
to
an
end
now
let
him
get
help
elsewhere
and
she
says
to
me
she
says
a
week
them
was
her
words
i
says
it
was
thousand
pounds
it
should
stop
and
from
that
day
to
this
she
has
set
foot
inside
that
gate
there
was
a
short
silence
then
did
barrett
ever
anythink
like
somebody
vaguely
inquired
barrett
turned
austerely
on
the
speaker
what
barrett
saw
and
barrett
did
see
shall
not
pass
these
lips
even
as
it
is
written
keep
thy
tongue
from
speaking
evil
he
said
another
man
spoke
he
was
pretty
near
canned
up
in
the
and
that
night
were
he
jim
yes
copped
it
not
standing
treat
much
neither
he
was
in
the
bar
all
on
his
own
so
was
we
talked
about
it
the
fat
man
made
another
attempt
she
got
the
key
off
of
me
she
the
number
of
it
she
come
into
my
shop
of
a
tuesday
evening
nobody
heeded
him
shut
your
heads
a
heavy
labourer
commented
gruffly
she
has
been
found
yet
the
inspectors
we
shall
know
more
in
a
bit
two
inspectors
had
come
up
and
were
talking
to
the
constables
who
guarded
the
gate
the
little
fat
man
ran
eagerly
forward
saying
that
she
had
bought
the
key
of
him
i
remember
the
number
because
of
it
being
three
one
and
three
three
he
exclaimed
excitedly
an
inspector
put
him
aside
nobody
been
in
he
asked
of
one
of
the
constables
no
sir
then
you
brackley
come
with
us
you
smith
keep
the
gate
there
a
squad
on
its
way
the
two
inspectors
and
the
constable
passed
down
the
alley
and
entered
the
house
they
mounted
the
wide
carved
staircase
this
do
look
as
if
he
been
out
much
lately
one
of
the
inspectors
muttered
as
he
kicked
aside
a
litter
of
dead
leaves
and
paper
that
lay
outside
oleron
door
i
do
think
we
need
knock
break
a
pane
brackley
the
door
had
two
glazed
panels
there
was
a
sound
of
shattered
glass
and
brackley
put
his
hand
through
the
hole
his
elbow
had
made
and
drew
back
the
latch
faugh
choked
one
of
the
inspectors
as
they
entered
let
some
light
and
air
in
quick
it
stinks
like
a
hearse
the
assembly
out
in
the
square
saw
the
red
blinds
go
up
and
the
windows
of
the
old
house
flung
open
that
better
said
one
of
the
inspectors
putting
his
head
out
of
a
window
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
that
seems
to
be
the
bedroom
in
there
will
you
go
in
simms
while
i
go
over
the
rest
they
had
drawn
up
the
bedroom
blind
also
and
the
emaciated
man
on
the
bed
had
made
a
blinker
of
his
hand
against
the
torturing
flood
of
brightness
nor
could
he
believe
that
his
hearing
was
not
playing
tricks
with
him
for
there
were
two
policemen
in
his
room
bending
over
him
and
asking
where
she
was
he
shook
his
head
this
woman
bengough
goes
by
the
name
of
miss
elsie
bengough
d
hear
where
is
she
no
good
brackley
get
him
up
be
careful
with
him
i
just
shove
head
out
of
the
window
i
think
the
other
inspector
had
been
through
oleron
study
and
had
found
nothing
and
was
now
in
the
kitchen
kicking
aside
an
mass
of
vegetable
refuse
that
cumbered
the
floor
the
kitchen
window
had
no
blind
and
was
by
the
blank
end
of
the
house
across
the
alley
the
kitchen
appeared
to
be
empty
but
the
inspector
kicking
aside
the
dead
flowers
noticed
that
a
shuffling
track
that
was
not
of
his
making
had
been
swept
to
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
of
the
cupboard
was
a
square
panel
that
looked
as
if
it
slid
on
runners
the
door
itself
was
closed
the
inspector
advanced
put
out
his
hand
to
the
little
knob
and
slid
the
hatch
along
its
groove
then
he
took
an
involuntary
step
back
again
framed
in
the
aperture
and
falling
forward
a
little
before
it
jammed
again
in
its
frame
was
something
that
resembled
a
large
lumpy
pudding
done
up
in
a
of
faded
browny
red
frieze
ah
said
the
inspector
to
close
the
hatch
again
he
would
have
had
to
thrust
that
pudding
back
with
his
hand
and
somehow
he
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
touching
it
instead
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
cupboard
itself
there
was
weight
behind
it
so
much
weight
that
after
opening
the
door
three
or
four
inches
and
peering
inside
he
had
to
put
his
shoulder
to
it
in
order
to
close
it
again
in
closing
it
he
left
sticking
out
a
few
inches
from
the
floor
a
triangle
of
black
and
white
check
skirt
he
went
into
the
small
hall
all
right
he
called
they
had
got
oleron
into
his
clothes
he
still
used
his
hands
as
blinkers
and
his
brain
was
very
confused
a
number
of
things
were
happening
that
he
could
understand
he
could
understand
the
extraordinary
mess
of
dead
flowers
there
seemed
to
be
everywhere
he
could
understand
why
there
should
be
police
officers
in
his
room
he
could
understand
why
one
of
these
should
be
sent
for
a
and
a
stretcher
and
he
could
understand
what
heavy
article
they
seemed
to
be
moving
about
in
the
kitchen
his
kitchen
what
the
matter
he
muttered
sleepily
then
he
heard
a
murmur
in
the
square
and
the
stopping
of
a
outside
a
police
officer
was
at
his
elbow
again
and
oleron
wondered
why
when
he
whispered
something
to
him
he
should
run
off
a
string
of
words
something
about
used
in
evidence
against
you
they
had
lifted
him
to
his
feet
and
were
assisting
him
towards
the
door
no
oleron
could
understand
it
at
all
they
got
him
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
alley
oleron
was
aware
of
confused
angry
shoutings
he
gathered
that
a
number
of
people
wanted
to
lynch
somebody
or
other
then
his
attention
became
fixed
on
a
little
fat
man
who
appeared
to
be
making
a
statement
that
an
officer
was
taking
down
in
a
notebook
i
seen
her
with
him
they
was
often
together
she
came
into
my
shop
and
said
it
was
for
him
i
thought
it
was
all
right
the
number
was
the
man
was
saying
the
people
seemed
to
be
very
angry
many
police
were
keeping
them
back
but
one
of
the
inspectors
had
a
voice
that
oleron
thought
quite
kind
and
friendly
he
was
telling
somebody
to
get
somebody
else
into
the
cab
before
something
or
other
was
brought
out
and
oleron
noticed
that
a
was
drawn
up
at
the
gate
it
appeared
that
it
was
himself
who
was
to
be
put
into
it
and
as
they
lifted
him
up
he
saw
that
the
inspector
tried
to
stand
between
him
and
something
that
stood
behind
the
cab
but
was
not
quick
enough
to
prevent
oleron
seeing
that
this
something
was
a
hooded
stretcher
the
angry
voices
sounded
like
a
sea
something
hard
like
a
stone
hit
the
back
of
the
cab
and
the
inspector
followed
oleron
in
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
window
nearer
the
side
where
the
people
were
the
door
they
had
put
oleron
in
at
remained
open
apparently
till
the
other
inspector
should
come
and
through
the
opening
oleron
had
a
glimpse
of
the
to
let
boards
among
the
one
of
them
said
that
the
key
was
at
number
six
suddenly
the
raging
of
voices
was
hushed
along
the
shuffling
steps
were
heard
and
the
other
inspector
appeared
at
the
cab
door
right
away
he
said
to
the
driver
he
entered
fastened
the
door
after
him
and
blocked
up
the
second
window
with
his
back
between
the
two
inspectors
oleron
slept
peacefully
the
cab
moved
down
the
square
the
other
vehicle
went
up
the
hill
the
mortuary
lay
that
way
phantas
for
barring
all
pother
with
this
or
the
other
still
britons
are
lords
of
the
the
chapter
of
admirals
i
as
abel
keeling
lay
on
the
galleon
deck
held
from
rolling
down
it
only
by
his
own
weight
and
the
hand
that
lay
outstretched
upon
the
planks
his
gaze
wandered
but
ever
returned
to
the
bell
that
hung
jammed
with
the
dangerous
of
the
vessel
in
the
small
ornamental
belfry
immediately
abaft
the
mainmast
the
bell
was
of
cast
bronze
with
bosses
upon
it
that
had
been
the
heads
of
cherubs
but
wind
and
salt
spray
had
given
it
a
thick
incrustation
of
bright
beautiful
lichenous
green
it
was
this
colour
that
abel
keeling
eyes
liked
for
wherever
else
on
the
galleon
his
eyes
rested
they
found
only
whiteness
the
whiteness
of
extreme
eld
there
were
slightly
varying
degrees
in
her
whiteness
here
she
was
of
a
white
that
glistened
like
there
of
a
greyish
chalky
white
and
again
her
whiteness
had
the
yellowish
cast
of
decay
but
everywhere
it
was
the
mild
disquieting
whiteness
of
materials
out
of
which
the
life
had
departed
her
cordage
was
bleached
as
old
straw
is
bleached
and
half
her
ropes
kept
their
shape
little
more
firmly
than
the
ash
of
a
string
keeps
its
shape
after
the
fire
has
passed
her
pallid
timbers
were
white
and
clean
as
bones
found
in
sand
and
even
the
wild
frankincense
with
which
for
lack
of
tar
at
her
last
touching
of
land
she
had
been
pitched
had
dried
to
a
pale
hard
gum
that
sparkled
like
quartz
in
her
open
seams
the
sun
was
yet
so
pale
a
buckler
of
silver
through
the
still
white
mists
that
not
a
cord
or
timber
cast
a
shadow
and
only
abel
keeling
face
and
hands
were
black
carked
and
from
exposure
to
his
pitiless
rays
the
galleon
was
the
of
the
and
she
had
a
frightful
list
to
starboard
so
canted
was
she
that
her
mainyard
dipped
one
of
its
steel
sickles
into
the
glassy
water
and
had
her
foremast
remained
or
more
than
the
broken
stump
of
her
bonaventure
mizzen
she
must
have
turned
over
completely
many
days
ago
they
had
stripped
the
mainyard
of
its
course
and
had
passed
the
sail
under
the
mary
bottom
in
the
hope
that
it
would
stop
the
leak
this
it
had
partly
done
as
long
as
the
galleon
had
continued
to
glide
one
way
then
without
coming
about
she
had
begun
to
glide
the
other
the
ropes
had
parted
and
she
had
dragged
the
sail
after
her
leaving
a
broad
tarnish
on
the
silver
sea
for
it
was
broadside
that
the
galleon
glided
almost
imperceptibly
ever
sucking
down
she
glided
as
if
a
loadstone
drew
her
and
at
first
abel
keeling
had
thought
it
was
a
loadstone
pulling
at
her
iron
drawing
her
through
the
pearly
mists
that
lay
like
to
the
water
and
hid
at
a
short
distance
the
tarnish
left
by
the
sail
but
later
he
had
known
that
it
was
no
loadstone
drawing
at
her
iron
the
motion
was
due
must
be
due
to
the
absolute
deadness
of
the
calm
in
that
silent
sinister
waterway
with
the
eye
of
his
mind
he
saw
that
loadstone
now
as
he
lay
against
a
all
but
toppling
down
the
deck
soon
that
would
happen
again
which
had
happened
for
five
days
past
he
would
hear
again
the
chattering
of
monkeys
and
the
screaming
of
parrots
the
mat
of
green
and
yellow
weeds
would
creep
in
towards
the
mary
over
the
quicksilver
sea
once
more
the
sheer
wall
of
rock
would
rise
and
the
men
would
run
but
no
the
men
would
not
run
this
time
to
drop
the
fenders
there
were
no
men
left
to
do
so
unless
bligh
was
still
alive
perhaps
bligh
was
still
alive
he
had
walked
down
the
steps
a
little
before
the
sudden
nightfall
of
the
day
before
had
then
fallen
and
lain
for
a
minute
dead
abel
keeling
had
supposed
watching
him
from
his
place
by
the
and
had
then
got
up
again
and
tottered
forward
to
the
forecastle
his
tall
figure
swaying
and
his
long
arms
waving
abel
keeling
had
not
seen
him
since
most
likely
he
had
died
in
the
forecastle
during
the
night
if
he
had
not
been
dead
he
would
have
come
aft
again
for
water
at
the
remembrance
of
the
water
abel
keeling
lifted
his
head
the
strands
of
lean
muscle
about
his
emaciated
mouth
worked
and
he
made
a
little
pressure
of
his
hand
on
the
deck
as
if
to
verify
its
steepness
and
his
own
balance
the
mainmast
was
some
seven
or
eight
yards
away
he
put
one
stiff
leg
under
him
and
began
seated
as
he
was
to
make
shuffling
movements
down
the
slope
to
the
mainmast
near
the
belfry
was
affixed
his
contrivance
for
catching
water
it
consisted
of
a
collar
of
rope
set
lower
at
one
side
than
at
the
other
but
that
had
been
before
the
mast
had
steeved
so
many
degrees
away
from
the
zenith
and
tallowed
beneath
the
mists
lingered
later
in
that
gully
of
a
strait
than
they
did
on
the
open
ocean
and
the
collar
of
rope
served
as
a
collector
for
the
dews
that
condensed
on
the
mast
the
drops
fell
into
a
small
earthen
pipkin
placed
on
the
deck
beneath
it
abel
keeling
reached
the
pipkin
and
looked
into
it
it
was
nearly
a
third
full
of
fresh
water
good
if
bligh
the
mate
was
dead
so
much
the
more
water
for
abel
keeling
master
of
the
of
the
he
dipped
two
fingers
into
the
pipkin
and
put
them
into
his
mouth
this
he
did
several
times
he
did
not
dare
to
raise
the
pipkin
to
his
black
and
broken
lips
for
dread
of
a
remembered
agony
he
could
not
have
told
how
many
days
ago
when
a
devil
had
whispered
to
him
and
he
had
gulped
down
the
contents
of
the
pipkin
in
the
morning
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
had
gone
waterless
again
he
moistened
his
fingers
and
sucked
them
then
he
lay
sprawling
against
the
mast
idly
watching
the
drops
of
water
as
they
fell
it
was
odd
how
the
drops
formed
slowly
they
collected
at
the
edge
of
the
tallowed
collar
trembled
in
their
fullness
for
an
instant
and
fell
another
beginning
the
process
instantly
it
amused
abel
keeling
to
watch
them
why
he
wondered
were
all
the
drops
the
same
size
what
cause
and
compulsion
did
they
obey
that
they
never
varied
and
what
frail
tenuity
held
the
little
globules
intact
it
must
be
due
to
some
cause
he
remembered
that
the
aromatic
gum
of
the
wild
frankincense
with
which
they
had
parcelled
the
seams
had
hung
on
the
buckets
in
great
sluggish
gouts
obedient
to
a
different
compulsion
oil
was
different
again
and
so
were
juices
and
balsams
only
quicksilver
perhaps
the
heavy
and
motionless
sea
put
him
in
mind
of
quicksilver
seemed
obedient
to
no
law
why
was
it
so
bligh
of
course
would
have
had
his
explanation
it
was
the
hand
of
god
that
sufficed
for
bligh
who
had
gone
forward
the
evening
before
and
whom
abel
keeling
now
seemed
vaguely
and
as
at
a
distance
to
remember
as
the
fanatic
who
had
sung
his
hymns
as
man
by
man
he
had
committed
the
bodies
of
the
ship
company
to
the
deep
bligh
was
that
sort
of
man
accepted
things
without
question
was
content
to
take
things
as
they
were
and
be
ready
with
the
fenders
when
the
wall
of
rock
rose
out
of
the
opalescent
mists
bligh
too
like
the
waterdrops
had
his
law
that
was
his
and
nobody
else
there
floated
down
from
some
rotten
rope
up
aloft
a
flake
of
scurf
that
settled
in
the
pipkin
abel
keeling
watched
it
dully
as
it
settled
towards
the
pipkin
rim
when
presently
he
again
dipped
his
fingers
into
the
vessel
the
water
ran
into
a
little
vortex
drawing
the
flake
with
it
the
water
settled
again
and
again
the
minute
flake
determined
towards
the
rim
and
adhered
there
as
if
the
rim
had
power
to
draw
it
it
was
exactly
so
that
the
galleon
was
gliding
towards
the
wall
of
rock
the
yellow
and
green
weeds
and
the
monkeys
and
parrots
put
out
into
again
while
there
had
been
men
to
put
her
out
she
had
glided
to
the
other
wall
one
force
drew
the
chip
in
the
pipkin
and
the
ship
over
the
tranced
sea
it
was
the
hand
of
god
said
bligh
abel
keeling
his
mind
now
noting
minute
things
and
now
clouded
with
torpor
did
not
at
first
hear
a
voice
that
was
quakingly
lifted
up
over
by
the
forecastle
a
voice
that
drew
nearer
to
an
accompaniment
of
swirling
water
o
thou
that
jonas
in
the
fish
three
days
didst
keep
from
pain
which
was
a
figure
of
thy
death
and
rising
up
again
it
was
bligh
singing
one
of
his
hymns
o
thou
that
noah
keptst
from
flood
and
abram
day
by
day
as
he
along
through
egypt
passed
didst
guide
him
in
the
way
the
voice
ceased
leaving
the
pious
period
uncompleted
bligh
was
alive
at
any
rate
abel
keeling
resumed
his
fitful
musing
yes
that
was
the
law
of
bligh
life
to
call
things
the
hand
of
god
but
abel
keeling
law
was
different
no
better
no
worse
only
different
the
hand
of
god
that
drew
chips
and
galleons
must
work
by
some
method
and
abel
keeling
eyes
were
dully
on
the
pipkin
again
as
if
he
sought
the
method
there
then
conscious
thought
left
him
for
a
space
and
when
he
resumed
it
was
without
obvious
connection
oars
of
course
were
the
thing
with
oars
men
could
laugh
at
calms
oars
that
only
pinnaces
and
galliasses
now
used
had
had
their
advantages
but
oars
which
was
to
say
a
method
for
you
could
say
if
you
liked
that
the
hand
of
god
grasped
the
as
the
breath
of
god
filled
the
sail
oars
were
antiquated
belonged
to
the
past
and
meant
a
of
all
that
was
good
and
new
and
a
return
to
fine
lines
a
abreast
to
give
effect
to
the
shock
of
the
ram
and
a
day
or
two
at
sea
and
then
to
port
again
for
provisions
oars
no
abel
keeling
was
one
of
the
new
men
the
men
who
swore
by
the
the
broadside
fire
of
sakers
and
and
weeks
and
months
without
a
landfall
perhaps
one
day
the
wits
of
such
men
as
he
would
devise
a
craft
not
because
oars
could
not
penetrate
into
the
remote
seas
of
the
world
not
because
men
who
trusted
to
sails
found
themselves
in
an
airless
strait
suspended
motionless
between
cloud
and
water
ever
gliding
to
a
wall
of
rock
but
a
ship
a
ship
noah
and
his
sons
with
him
god
spake
and
thus
said
he
a
covenant
set
i
up
with
you
and
your
it
was
bligh
again
wandering
somewhere
in
the
waist
abel
keeling
mind
was
once
more
a
blank
then
slowly
slowly
as
the
water
drops
collected
on
the
collar
of
rope
his
thought
took
shape
again
a
galliasse
no
not
a
galliasse
the
galliasse
made
shift
to
be
two
things
and
was
neither
this
ship
that
the
hand
of
man
should
one
day
make
for
the
hand
of
god
to
manage
should
be
a
ship
that
should
take
and
conserve
the
force
of
the
wind
take
it
and
store
it
as
she
stored
her
victuals
at
rest
when
she
wished
going
ahead
when
she
wished
turning
the
forces
both
of
calm
and
storm
against
themselves
for
of
course
her
force
must
be
wind
stored
wind
a
bag
of
the
winds
as
the
tale
had
it
wind
probably
directed
upon
the
water
astern
driving
it
away
and
urging
forward
the
ship
acting
by
reaction
she
would
have
a
into
which
wind
would
be
pumped
with
pumps
bligh
would
call
that
equally
the
hand
of
god
this
of
the
ship
of
the
future
that
abel
keeling
dimly
foreshadowed
as
he
lay
between
the
mainmast
and
the
belfry
turning
his
eyes
now
and
then
from
ashy
white
timbers
to
the
vivid
green
of
the
bell
above
him
bligh
face
with
the
sun
and
ravaged
from
inwards
by
the
faith
that
consumed
him
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
steps
his
voice
beat
uncontrolledly
out
and
in
the
earth
here
is
no
place
of
refuge
to
be
found
nor
in
the
deep
and
that
passeth
under
ground
ii
bligh
eyes
were
lidded
as
if
in
contemplation
of
his
inner
ecstasy
his
head
was
thrown
back
and
his
brows
worked
up
and
down
tormentedly
his
wide
mouth
remained
open
as
his
hymn
was
suddenly
interrupted
on
the
note
from
somewhere
in
the
shimmering
mists
the
note
was
taken
up
and
there
drummed
and
rang
and
reverberated
through
the
strait
a
windy
hoarse
and
dismal
bellow
alarming
and
sustained
a
tremor
rang
through
bligh
moving
like
a
sightless
man
he
stumbled
forward
from
the
head
of
the
steps
and
abel
keeling
was
aware
of
his
gaunt
figure
behind
him
taller
for
the
steepness
of
the
deck
as
that
vast
empty
sound
died
away
bligh
laughed
in
his
mania
lord
hath
the
grave
wide
mouth
a
tongue
to
praise
thee
lo
again
again
the
cavernous
sound
possessed
the
air
louder
and
nearer
through
it
came
another
sound
a
slow
throb
throb
throb
throb
again
the
sounds
ceased
even
leviathan
lifteth
up
his
voice
in
praise
bligh
sobbed
abel
keeling
did
not
raise
his
head
there
had
returned
to
him
the
memory
of
that
day
when
before
the
morning
mists
had
lifted
from
the
strait
he
had
emptied
the
pipkin
of
the
water
that
was
the
allowance
until
night
should
fall
again
during
that
agony
of
thirst
he
had
seen
shapes
and
heard
sounds
with
other
than
his
mortal
eyes
and
ears
and
even
in
the
moments
that
had
alternated
with
his
lightness
when
he
had
known
these
to
be
hallucinations
they
had
come
again
he
had
heard
the
bells
on
a
sunday
in
his
own
kentish
home
the
calling
of
children
at
play
the
unconcerned
singing
of
men
at
their
daily
labour
and
the
laughter
and
gossip
of
the
women
as
they
had
spread
the
linen
on
the
hedge
or
distributed
bread
upon
the
platters
these
voices
had
rung
in
his
brain
interrupted
now
and
then
by
the
groans
of
bligh
and
of
two
other
men
who
had
been
alive
then
some
of
the
voices
he
had
heard
had
been
silent
on
earth
this
many
a
long
year
but
abel
keeling
had
heard
them
even
as
he
was
now
hearing
that
vacant
moaning
with
the
intermittent
throbbing
that
filled
the
strait
with
alarm
praise
him
praise
him
praise
him
bligh
was
calling
deliriously
then
a
bell
seemed
to
sound
in
abel
keeling
ears
and
as
if
something
in
the
mechanism
of
his
brain
had
slipped
another
picture
rose
in
his
fancy
the
scene
when
the
of
the
had
put
out
to
a
bravery
of
swinging
bells
and
shrill
fifes
and
valiant
trumpets
she
had
not
been
a
galleon
then
the
on
her
prow
had
twinkled
with
gilding
her
belfry
and
and
elaborate
lanterns
had
flashed
in
the
sun
with
gold
and
her
and
the
about
her
waist
had
been
gay
with
painted
coats
and
scutcheons
to
her
sails
had
been
stitched
gaudy
ramping
lions
of
scarlet
saye
and
from
her
mainyard
now
dipping
in
the
water
had
hung
the
broad
pennant
with
the
virgin
and
child
embroidered
upon
it
then
suddenly
a
voice
about
him
seemed
to
be
saying
a
and
a
and
in
a
twink
the
picture
in
abel
keeling
brain
changed
again
he
was
at
home
again
instructing
his
son
young
abel
in
the
casting
of
the
lead
from
the
skiff
they
had
pulled
out
of
the
harbour
a
the
boy
seemed
to
be
calling
abel
keeling
blackened
lips
muttered
excellently
well
cast
abel
excellently
well
cast
a
and
a
seven
seven
ah
abel
keeling
murmured
that
last
was
not
a
clear
cast
give
me
the
line
thus
it
should
go
ay
so
soon
you
shall
sail
the
seas
with
me
in
the
of
the
you
are
already
perfect
in
the
stars
and
the
motions
of
the
planets
i
will
instruct
you
in
the
use
of
the
backstaff
for
a
minute
or
two
he
continued
to
mutter
then
he
dozed
when
again
he
came
to
it
was
once
more
to
the
sound
of
bells
at
first
faint
then
louder
and
finally
becoming
a
noisy
clamour
immediately
above
his
head
it
was
bligh
bligh
in
a
fresh
attack
of
delirium
had
seized
the
and
was
ringing
the
bell
insanely
the
cord
broke
in
his
fingers
but
he
thrust
at
the
bell
with
his
hand
and
again
called
aloud
upon
an
harp
and
an
instrument
of
ten
strings
let
heaven
and
earth
praise
thy
name
he
continued
to
call
aloud
and
to
beat
on
the
bell
ship
ahoy
what
ship
that
one
would
have
said
that
a
veritable
hail
had
come
out
of
the
mists
but
abel
keeling
knew
those
hails
that
came
out
of
the
mists
they
came
from
ships
which
were
not
there
ay
ay
keep
a
good
and
have
a
care
to
your
lodemanage
he
muttered
again
to
his
son
but
as
sometimes
a
sleeper
sits
up
in
his
dream
or
rises
from
his
couch
and
walks
so
all
of
a
sudden
abel
keeling
found
himself
on
his
hands
and
knees
on
the
deck
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
in
some
region
of
his
consciousness
he
was
dimly
aware
that
the
cant
of
the
deck
had
become
more
perilous
but
his
brain
received
the
intelligence
and
forgot
it
again
he
was
looking
out
into
the
bright
and
baffling
mists
the
buckler
of
the
sun
was
of
a
more
ardent
silver
the
sea
below
it
was
lost
in
brilliant
evaporation
and
between
them
suspended
in
the
haze
no
more
substantial
than
the
vague
darknesses
that
float
before
dazzled
eyes
a
pyramidal
hung
abel
keeling
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
but
when
he
removed
it
the
shape
was
still
there
gliding
slowly
towards
the
quarter
its
form
changed
as
he
watched
it
the
shape
that
had
been
a
pyramid
seemed
to
dissolve
into
four
upright
members
slightly
graduated
in
tallness
that
nearest
the
stern
the
tallest
and
that
to
the
left
the
lowest
it
might
have
been
the
shadow
of
the
gigantic
set
of
on
which
that
vacant
mournful
note
had
been
sounded
and
as
he
looked
with
fooled
eyes
again
his
ears
became
fooled
ahoy
there
what
ship
that
are
you
a
ship
here
give
me
that
trumpet
then
a
metallic
barking
ahoy
there
what
the
devil
are
you
did
you
ring
a
bell
ring
it
again
or
blow
a
blast
or
something
and
go
dead
slow
all
this
came
as
it
were
indistinctly
and
through
a
sort
of
high
singing
in
abel
keeling
own
ears
then
he
fancied
a
short
bewildered
laugh
followed
by
a
colloquy
from
somewhere
between
sea
and
sky
here
ward
just
pinch
me
will
you
tell
me
what
you
see
there
i
want
to
know
if
i
awake
see
where
there
on
the
starboard
bow
stop
that
ventilating
fan
i
hear
myself
think
see
anything
do
tell
me
it
that
damned
dutchman
do
pitch
me
that
old
vanderdecken
tale
give
me
an
easy
one
first
something
about
a
you
did
hear
that
bell
did
you
shut
up
a
minute
listen
again
bligh
voice
was
lifted
up
this
is
the
that
i
make
from
henceforth
nevermore
will
i
again
the
world
destroy
with
water
as
before
bligh
voice
died
away
again
in
abel
keeling
ears
my
fat
aunt
julia
the
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
between
sea
and
sky
sounded
again
then
it
spoke
more
loudly
say
it
began
with
careful
politeness
you
are
a
ship
do
you
mind
telling
us
where
the
masquerade
is
to
be
our
wireless
is
out
of
order
and
we
had
heard
of
it
oh
you
do
see
it
ward
do
you
please
please
tell
us
what
the
hell
you
are
again
abel
keeling
had
moved
as
a
sleepwalker
moves
he
had
raised
himself
up
by
the
belfry
timbers
and
bligh
had
sunk
in
a
heap
on
the
deck
abel
keeling
movement
overturned
the
pipkin
which
raced
the
little
trickle
of
its
contents
down
the
deck
and
lodged
where
the
still
and
brimming
sea
made
as
it
were
a
chain
with
the
carved
balustrade
of
the
one
link
a
still
gleaming
edge
then
a
dark
baluster
and
then
another
gleaming
link
for
one
moment
only
abel
keeling
found
himself
noticing
that
that
which
had
driven
bligh
aft
had
been
the
rising
of
the
water
in
the
waist
as
the
galleon
settled
by
the
head
the
waist
was
now
entirely
submerged
then
once
more
he
was
absorbed
in
his
dream
its
voices
and
its
shape
in
the
mist
which
had
again
taken
the
form
of
a
pyramid
before
his
eyeballs
a
voice
seemed
to
be
complaining
anew
and
still
through
that
confused
dinning
in
abel
keeling
ears
ca
turn
a
on
it
and
of
course
ward
i
do
believe
in
hear
ward
i
do
believe
in
i
say
shall
we
call
down
to
old
a
this
might
interest
his
scientific
skippership
oh
lower
a
boat
and
pull
out
to
it
into
it
over
it
through
it
look
at
our
chaps
crowded
on
the
barbette
yonder
they
seen
it
better
not
give
an
order
you
know
wo
be
obeyed
abel
keeling
cramped
against
the
antique
belfry
had
begun
to
find
his
dream
interesting
for
though
he
did
not
know
her
build
that
mirage
was
the
shape
of
a
ship
no
doubt
it
was
projected
from
his
brooding
on
ships
of
half
an
hour
before
and
that
was
odd
but
perhaps
after
all
it
was
not
very
odd
he
knew
that
she
did
not
really
exist
only
the
appearance
of
her
existed
but
things
had
to
exist
like
that
before
they
really
existed
before
the
of
the
had
existed
she
had
been
a
shape
in
some
man
imagination
before
that
some
dreamer
had
dreamed
the
form
of
a
ship
with
oars
and
before
that
far
away
in
the
dawn
and
infancy
of
the
world
some
seer
had
seen
in
a
vision
the
raft
before
man
had
ventured
to
push
out
over
the
water
on
his
two
planks
and
since
this
shape
that
rode
before
abel
keeling
eyes
was
a
shape
in
his
abel
keeling
dream
he
abel
keeling
was
the
master
of
it
his
own
brooding
brain
had
contrived
her
and
she
was
launched
upon
the
illimitable
ocean
of
his
own
mind
and
i
will
not
unmindful
be
of
this
my
covenant
passed
twixt
me
and
you
and
every
flesh
whiles
that
the
world
should
last
sang
bligh
rapt
but
as
a
dreamer
even
in
his
dream
will
scratch
upon
the
wall
by
his
couch
some
key
or
word
to
put
him
in
mind
of
his
vision
on
the
morrow
when
it
has
left
him
so
abel
keeling
found
himself
seeking
some
sign
to
be
a
proof
to
those
to
whom
no
vision
is
vouchsafed
even
bligh
sought
that
could
not
be
silent
in
his
bliss
but
lay
on
the
deck
there
uttering
great
passionate
amens
and
praising
his
maker
as
he
said
upon
an
harp
and
an
instrument
of
ten
strings
so
with
abel
keeling
it
would
be
the
amen
of
his
life
to
have
praised
god
not
upon
a
harp
but
upon
a
ship
that
should
carry
her
own
power
that
should
store
wind
or
its
equivalent
as
she
stored
her
victuals
that
should
be
something
wrested
from
the
chaos
of
uninvention
and
ordered
and
disciplined
and
subordinated
to
abel
keeling
will
and
there
she
was
that
thing
of
with
the
four
pipes
that
resembled
a
phantom
organ
now
broadside
and
of
equal
length
and
the
of
that
ship
were
speaking
again
the
interrupted
silver
chain
by
the
quarterdeck
balustrade
had
now
become
continuous
and
the
balusters
made
a
over
their
own
motionless
reflections
the
spilt
water
from
the
pipkin
had
dried
and
the
pipkin
was
not
to
be
seen
abel
keeling
stood
beside
the
mast
erect
as
god
made
man
to
go
with
his
leathery
hand
he
smote
upon
the
bell
he
waited
for
the
space
of
a
minute
and
then
cried
ahoy
ship
ahoy
what
ship
that
iii
we
are
not
conscious
in
a
dream
that
we
are
playing
a
game
the
beginning
and
end
of
which
are
in
ourselves
in
this
dream
of
abel
keeling
a
voice
replied
it
found
its
tongue
ahoy
there
what
are
you
loudly
and
in
a
clear
voice
abel
keeling
called
are
you
a
ship
with
a
nervous
giggle
the
answer
came
are
a
ship
are
we
ward
i
hardly
feel
sure
yes
of
course
we
a
ship
no
question
about
us
the
question
is
what
the
dickens
you
not
all
the
words
these
voices
used
were
intelligible
to
abel
keeling
and
he
knew
not
what
it
was
in
the
tone
of
these
last
words
that
reminded
him
of
the
honour
due
to
the
of
the
and
at
the
end
of
her
life
as
she
was
abel
keeling
was
still
jealous
of
her
dignity
the
voice
had
a
youngish
ring
and
it
was
not
fitting
that
young
chins
should
be
wagged
about
his
galleon
he
spoke
curtly
you
that
spoke
are
you
the
master
of
that
ship
of
the
the
words
floated
back
then
send
for
him
it
is
with
masters
that
masters
hold
speech
abel
keeling
replied
he
could
see
the
two
shapes
flat
and
without
relief
standing
on
a
high
narrow
structure
with
rails
one
of
them
gave
a
low
whistle
and
seemed
to
be
fanning
his
face
but
the
other
rumbled
something
into
a
sort
of
funnel
presently
the
two
shapes
became
three
there
was
a
murmuring
as
of
a
consultation
and
then
suddenly
a
new
voice
spoke
at
its
thrill
and
tone
a
sudden
tremor
ran
through
abel
keeling
frame
he
wondered
what
response
it
was
that
that
voice
found
in
the
forgotten
recesses
of
his
memory
seemed
to
call
this
new
yet
faintly
remembered
voice
all
this
about
listen
we
his
majesty
seapink
of
devonport
last
october
and
nothing
particular
the
matter
with
us
now
who
are
you
the
of
the
out
of
the
port
of
rye
on
the
day
of
saint
anne
and
only
two
men
a
gasp
interrupted
him
where
that
voice
that
so
strangely
moved
abel
keeling
said
unsteadily
while
bligh
broke
into
groans
of
renewed
rapture
out
of
the
port
of
rye
in
the
county
of
sussex
nay
give
ear
else
i
can
not
make
you
hear
me
while
this
man
spirit
and
flesh
wrestle
so
together
ahoy
are
you
gone
for
the
voices
had
become
a
low
murmur
and
the
had
faded
before
abel
keeling
eyes
again
and
again
he
called
he
wished
to
be
informed
of
the
disposition
and
economy
of
the
the
he
called
in
an
agony
lest
the
knowledge
almost
within
his
grasp
should
be
lost
i
would
know
about
the
like
an
echo
there
came
back
the
words
uncomprehendingly
uttered
that
driveth
the
vessel
perchance
is
not
wind
a
steel
bow
that
is
bent
also
conserveth
force
the
force
you
store
to
move
at
will
through
calm
and
storm
can
you
make
out
what
it
driving
at
oh
we
shall
all
wake
up
in
a
minute
quiet
i
have
it
the
engines
it
wants
to
know
about
our
engines
it
be
wanting
to
see
our
papers
presently
rye
port
well
no
harm
in
humouring
it
let
see
what
it
can
make
of
this
ahoy
there
came
the
voice
to
abel
keeling
a
little
more
strongly
as
if
a
shifting
wind
carried
it
and
speaking
faster
and
faster
as
it
went
on
not
wind
but
steam
hear
steam
steam
steam
in
eight
yarrow
boilers
steam
got
it
and
we
triple
expansion
engines
indicated
four
thousand
and
we
can
do
revolutions
per
minute
savvy
is
there
anything
your
phantomhood
would
like
to
know
about
our
armament
abel
keeling
was
muttering
fretfully
to
himself
it
annoyed
him
that
words
in
his
own
vision
should
have
no
meaning
for
him
how
did
words
come
to
him
in
a
dream
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
when
wide
awake
the
that
was
the
name
of
this
ship
but
a
pink
was
long
and
narrow
and
aft
as
for
our
armament
the
voice
with
the
tones
that
so
profoundly
troubled
abel
keeling
memory
continued
two
revolving
whitehead
three
on
the
upper
deck
and
that
a
forward
there
by
the
i
forgot
to
mention
that
we
nickel
steel
with
a
coal
capacity
of
sixty
tons
in
most
damnably
placed
bunkers
and
that
thirty
and
a
quarter
knots
is
about
our
top
care
to
come
aboard
but
the
voice
was
speaking
still
more
rapidly
and
feverishly
as
if
to
fill
a
silence
with
no
matter
what
and
the
shape
that
was
uttering
it
was
straining
forward
anxiously
over
the
rail
but
i
glad
this
happened
in
the
daylight
another
voice
was
muttering
i
wish
i
was
sure
it
was
happening
at
all
poor
old
spook
i
suppose
it
would
keep
its
feet
if
her
deck
was
quite
vertical
think
she
go
down
or
just
melt
kind
of
go
down
without
wash
listen
here
the
other
one
now
for
bligh
was
singing
again
for
lord
thou
our
nature
such
if
we
great
things
obtain
and
in
the
getting
of
the
same
do
feel
no
grief
or
pain
we
little
do
esteem
thereof
but
hardly
brought
to
pass
a
thousand
times
we
do
esteem
more
than
the
other
was
but
oh
look
look
look
at
the
other
oh
i
say
was
he
a
grand
old
boy
look
for
transfiguring
abel
reeling
form
as
a
prophet
form
is
transfigured
in
the
instant
of
his
rapture
flooding
his
brain
with
the
white
of
perfect
knowledge
that
for
which
he
and
his
dream
had
been
at
a
standstill
had
come
he
knew
her
this
ship
of
the
future
as
if
god
finger
had
bitten
her
lines
into
his
brain
he
knew
her
as
those
already
sinking
into
the
grave
know
things
miraculously
completely
accepting
life
impossibilities
with
a
nodded
of
course
from
the
ardent
mouths
of
her
eight
furnaces
to
the
last
drip
from
her
lubricators
from
her
to
the
breeches
of
her
he
knew
her
read
her
gauges
thumbed
her
bearings
gave
the
ranges
from
her
and
lived
the
life
he
lived
who
was
in
command
of
her
and
he
would
not
forget
on
the
morrow
as
he
had
forgotten
on
many
morrows
for
at
last
he
had
seen
the
water
about
his
feet
and
knew
that
there
would
be
no
morrow
for
him
in
this
world
and
even
in
that
moment
with
but
a
sand
or
two
to
run
in
his
glass
indomitable
insatiable
dreaming
dream
on
dream
he
could
not
die
until
he
knew
more
he
had
two
questions
to
ask
and
a
and
but
a
moment
remained
sharply
his
voice
rang
out
ho
there
this
ancient
ship
the
of
the
can
not
steam
thirty
and
a
quarter
knots
but
yet
she
can
sail
the
waters
what
more
does
your
ship
can
she
soar
above
them
as
the
fowls
of
the
air
soar
he
thinks
we
an
aeroplane
no
she
ca
and
can
you
dive
even
as
the
fishes
of
the
deep
those
are
submarines
we
are
a
submarine
but
abel
keeling
waited
for
no
more
he
gave
an
exulting
chuckle
oho
oho
thirty
knots
and
but
on
the
face
of
the
waters
no
more
than
that
oho
now
ship
the
ship
i
see
as
a
mother
sees
the
child
she
has
but
conceived
ship
i
say
oho
ship
shall
below
there
trip
that
gun
the
cry
came
suddenly
and
alertly
as
a
muffled
sound
came
from
below
and
an
ominous
tremor
shook
the
galleon
jove
her
guns
are
breaking
loose
below
that
her
trip
that
gun
and
the
others
abel
keeling
voice
rang
out
as
if
there
had
been
any
to
obey
him
he
had
braced
himself
within
the
belfry
frame
and
then
in
the
middle
of
the
next
order
his
voice
suddenly
failed
him
his
that
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
rode
once
more
before
his
eyes
this
was
the
end
and
his
apprehension
for
the
answer
to
which
was
now
torturing
his
face
and
bursting
his
heart
was
still
unasked
ho
he
that
spoke
with
me
the
master
he
cried
in
a
voice
that
ran
high
is
he
there
yes
came
the
other
voice
across
the
water
sick
with
suspense
be
quick
there
was
a
moment
in
which
hoarse
cries
from
many
voices
a
heavy
thud
and
rumble
on
wood
and
a
crash
of
timbers
and
a
gurgle
and
a
splash
were
indescribably
mingled
the
gun
under
which
abel
keeling
had
lain
had
snapped
her
rotten
breechings
and
plunged
down
the
deck
carrying
unconscious
form
with
it
the
deck
came
up
vertical
and
for
one
instant
longer
abel
keeling
clung
to
the
belfry
i
can
not
see
your
face
he
screamed
but
meseems
your
voice
is
a
voice
i
know
is
your
in
a
torn
sob
the
answer
came
across
the
water
abel
keeling
oh
my
god
and
abel
keeling
cry
of
triumph
that
mounted
to
a
victorious
huzza
was
lost
in
the
downward
plunge
of
the
of
the
that
left
the
strait
empty
save
for
the
sun
fiery
blaze
and
the
last
evaporation
of
the
mists
rooum
for
all
i
ever
knew
to
the
contrary
it
was
his
own
name
and
something
about
him
name
or
man
or
both
always
put
me
in
mind
i
ca
tell
you
how
of
negroes
as
regards
the
name
i
dare
say
it
was
something
huggermugger
in
the
mere
sound
something
that
i
classed
for
no
particular
reason
with
the
dark
and
ignorant
sort
of
words
such
as
obi
and
hoodoo
i
only
know
that
after
i
learned
that
his
name
was
rooum
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
have
thought
of
him
as
being
called
anything
else
the
first
impression
that
you
got
of
his
head
was
that
it
was
a
patchwork
of
black
and
white
black
bushy
hair
and
short
white
beard
or
else
the
other
way
about
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
hair
and
beard
were
piebald
so
that
if
you
saw
him
in
the
gloom
a
dim
patch
of
white
showed
down
one
side
of
his
head
and
dark
tufts
cropped
up
here
and
there
in
his
beard
his
eyebrows
alone
were
entirely
black
with
a
little
sprouting
of
hair
almost
joining
them
and
perhaps
his
skin
helped
to
make
me
think
of
negroes
for
it
was
very
dark
of
the
dark
brown
that
always
seems
to
have
more
than
a
hint
of
green
behind
it
his
forehead
was
low
and
scored
across
with
deep
horizontal
furrows
we
never
knew
when
he
was
going
to
turn
up
on
a
job
we
might
not
have
seen
him
for
weeks
but
his
face
was
always
as
likely
as
not
to
appear
over
the
edge
of
a
just
when
that
marvellous
mechanical
intuition
of
his
was
badly
needed
he
was
certificated
he
was
even
trained
as
the
rest
of
us
understood
training
and
he
scoffed
at
the
and
laughed
outright
at
logarithms
and
our
laborious
methods
of
getting
out
quantities
but
he
could
set
sheers
and
tackle
in
a
way
that
made
the
rest
of
us
look
silly
i
remember
once
how
through
the
parting
of
a
chain
a
girder
had
come
down
and
lay
under
a
ruck
of
other
stuff
as
the
bottom
chip
lies
under
a
pile
of
spellikins
a
smash
myself
i
certificated
twice
or
three
times
over
but
i
can
only
assure
you
that
i
wanted
to
kick
myself
when
after
i
spent
a
day
and
a
sleepless
night
over
the
job
i
saw
the
game
of
that
rooum
made
of
it
in
an
hour
or
two
certificated
or
not
a
man
is
a
fool
who
can
do
that
sort
of
thing
and
he
was
one
of
these
fellows
too
who
can
find
water
tell
you
where
water
is
and
what
amount
of
getting
it
is
likely
to
take
by
just
walking
over
the
place
we
are
certificated
up
to
that
yet
he
was
offered
good
money
to
stick
to
us
to
stick
to
our
firm
but
he
always
shook
his
piebald
head
he
never
be
able
to
keep
the
bargain
if
he
were
to
make
it
he
told
us
quite
fairly
i
know
there
are
these
chaps
who
ca
endure
to
be
clocked
to
their
work
with
a
patent
in
the
morning
and
released
of
an
evening
with
a
whistle
and
it
one
of
the
things
no
master
can
ever
understand
so
rooum
came
and
went
erratically
showing
up
maybe
in
leeds
or
liverpool
perhaps
next
on
plymouth
breakwater
and
once
he
turned
up
in
an
place
in
glamorganshire
just
when
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
the
way
i
got
to
know
him
got
to
know
him
i
mean
more
than
just
to
nod
was
that
he
tacked
himself
on
to
me
one
night
down
vauxhall
way
where
we
were
setting
up
some
small
plant
or
other
we
had
knocked
off
for
the
day
and
i
was
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
bridge
when
he
came
up
we
walked
along
together
and
we
had
not
gone
far
before
it
appeared
that
his
reason
for
joining
me
was
that
he
wanted
to
know
what
a
molecule
was
i
stared
at
him
a
bit
what
do
you
want
to
know
that
for
i
said
what
does
a
chap
like
you
who
can
do
it
all
backwards
want
with
molecules
oh
he
just
wanted
to
know
he
said
so
on
the
way
across
the
bridge
i
gave
it
him
more
or
less
from
the
book
molecular
theory
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
from
the
childish
questions
he
put
it
was
plain
that
he
had
got
the
hang
of
it
at
all
did
the
molecular
theory
allow
things
to
pass
through
one
another
he
wanted
to
know
things
pass
through
one
another
and
a
lot
of
ridiculous
things
like
that
i
gave
it
up
you
a
genius
in
your
own
way
rooum
i
said
finally
you
know
these
things
without
the
books
we
plodders
have
to
depend
on
if
i
luck
like
that
i
think
i
should
be
content
with
it
but
he
did
seem
satisfied
though
he
dropped
the
matter
for
that
time
but
i
had
his
acquaintance
which
was
more
than
most
of
us
had
he
asked
me
rather
timidly
if
i
lend
him
a
book
or
two
i
did
so
but
they
did
seem
to
contain
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
he
soon
returned
them
without
remark
now
you
expect
a
fellow
to
be
specially
sensitive
one
way
or
another
who
can
tell
when
there
water
a
hundred
feet
beneath
him
and
as
you
know
the
big
men
are
squabbling
yet
about
this
business
but
somehow
the
puzzled
me
less
than
it
did
that
rooum
should
be
extraordinarily
sensitive
to
something
far
commoner
and
easier
to
understand
ordinary
echoes
he
could
stand
echoes
he
go
a
mile
round
rather
than
pass
a
place
that
he
knew
had
an
echo
and
if
he
came
on
one
by
chance
sometimes
he
hurry
through
as
quick
as
he
could
and
sometimes
he
loiter
and
listen
very
intently
i
rather
joked
about
this
at
first
till
i
found
it
really
distressed
him
then
of
course
i
pretended
not
to
notice
we
all
cranky
somewhere
and
for
that
matter
i
ca
touch
a
spider
myself
for
the
remarkable
thing
that
overtook
rooum
that
by
the
way
is
an
odd
way
to
put
it
as
you
see
presently
but
the
words
came
that
way
into
my
head
so
let
them
stand
for
the
remarkable
thing
that
overtook
rooum
i
do
think
i
can
begin
better
than
with
the
first
time
or
very
soon
after
the
first
time
that
i
noticed
this
peculiarity
about
the
echoes
it
was
early
on
a
particularly
dismal
november
evening
and
this
time
we
were
somewhere
out
london
way
just
beyond
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
the
you
know
these
districts
of
wretched
trees
and
grimy
fields
and
that
are
about
the
same
to
real
country
that
a
slum
is
to
a
town
it
rained
that
night
rain
was
the
most
appropriate
weather
for
the
brickfields
and
and
yards
of
old
carts
and
we
were
passing
the
rain
shone
on
the
black
that
rooum
always
carried
and
i
sucked
at
the
dottle
of
a
pipe
that
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
fill
and
light
again
we
were
walking
in
the
direction
of
lewisham
i
think
it
would
be
and
were
still
a
little
way
from
that
eruption
of
houses
that
but
you
doubtless
seen
them
you
know
how
when
they
laying
out
new
roads
they
lay
down
the
narrow
strip
of
kerb
first
with
neither
setts
on
the
one
hand
nor
flagstones
on
the
other
we
had
come
upon
one
of
these
i
had
noticed
how
as
we
had
come
a
few
minutes
before
under
a
tall
railway
arch
rooum
had
all
at
once
stopped
talking
it
was
the
echo
of
course
that
bothered
him
the
unmade
road
to
which
we
had
come
had
headless
at
intervals
and
ramparts
of
grey
ready
for
use
and
save
for
the
strip
of
kerb
it
was
a
broth
of
mud
and
stiff
clay
a
red
light
or
two
showed
where
the
were
they
were
laying
the
mains
a
green
railway
light
showed
on
an
embankment
and
the
lewisham
lamps
made
a
rusty
glare
through
the
rain
rooum
went
first
walking
along
the
narrow
strip
of
kerb
the
were
a
little
difficult
to
see
and
when
i
heard
rooum
stop
suddenly
and
draw
in
his
breath
sharply
i
thought
he
had
walked
into
one
of
them
hurt
yourself
i
said
he
walked
on
without
replying
but
half
a
dozen
yards
farther
on
he
stopped
again
he
was
listening
again
he
waited
for
me
to
come
up
i
say
he
said
in
an
odd
sort
of
voice
go
a
yard
or
two
ahead
will
you
what
the
matter
i
asked
as
i
passed
ahead
he
did
answer
well
i
had
been
leading
for
more
than
a
minute
before
he
wanted
to
change
again
he
was
breathing
very
quick
and
short
why
what
ails
you
i
demanded
stopping
it
all
right
you
not
playing
any
tricks
are
you
i
saw
him
pass
his
hand
over
his
brow
come
get
on
i
said
shortly
and
we
did
speak
again
till
we
struck
the
pavement
with
the
lighted
lamps
then
i
happened
to
glance
at
him
here
i
said
brusquely
taking
him
by
the
sleeve
you
not
well
we
call
somewhere
and
get
a
drink
yes
he
said
again
wiping
his
brow
i
say
did
you
hear
hear
what
ah
you
did
and
of
course
you
did
feel
anything
come
you
shaking
when
presently
we
came
to
a
brightly
lighted
or
hotel
i
saw
that
he
was
shaking
even
worse
than
i
had
thought
the
barman
noticed
it
too
and
watched
us
curiously
i
made
rooum
sit
down
and
got
him
some
brandy
what
was
the
matter
i
asked
as
i
held
the
glass
to
his
lips
but
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
except
that
it
was
all
right
all
right
with
his
head
twitching
over
his
shoulder
almost
as
if
he
had
touch
of
the
dance
he
began
to
come
round
a
little
he
was
the
kind
of
man
you
press
for
explanations
and
presently
we
set
out
again
he
walked
with
me
as
far
as
my
lodgings
refused
to
come
in
but
for
all
that
lingered
at
the
gate
as
if
loath
to
leave
i
watched
him
turn
the
corner
in
the
rain
we
came
home
together
again
the
next
evening
but
by
a
different
way
quite
half
a
mile
longer
he
had
waited
for
me
a
little
pertinaciously
it
seemed
he
wanted
to
talk
about
molecules
again
well
when
a
man
of
his
age
he
be
near
fifty
begins
to
ask
questions
he
rather
worse
than
a
child
who
wants
to
know
where
heaven
is
or
some
such
thing
for
you
ca
put
him
off
as
you
can
the
child
somewhere
or
other
he
picked
up
the
word
osmosis
and
seemed
to
have
some
glimmering
of
its
meaning
he
dropped
the
molecules
and
began
to
ask
me
about
osmosis
it
means
does
it
he
demanded
that
liquids
will
work
their
way
into
one
another
through
a
bladder
or
something
say
a
thick
fluid
and
a
thin
you
find
some
of
the
thick
in
the
thin
and
the
thin
in
the
thick
yes
the
thick
into
the
thin
is
and
the
other
that
takes
place
more
quickly
but
i
do
know
a
deal
about
it
does
it
ever
take
place
with
solids
he
next
asked
what
was
he
driving
at
i
thought
but
replied
i
believe
that
what
is
commonly
called
is
something
of
the
sort
under
another
name
a
good
deal
of
this
bookwork
seems
to
be
finding
a
dozen
names
for
the
same
thing
he
grunted
and
continued
to
ask
his
questions
but
what
it
was
he
really
wanted
to
know
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
well
he
was
due
any
time
now
to
disappear
again
having
worked
quite
six
weeks
in
one
place
and
he
disappeared
he
disappeared
for
a
good
many
weeks
i
think
it
would
be
about
february
before
i
saw
or
heard
of
him
again
it
was
february
weather
anyway
and
in
an
echoing
enough
place
that
i
found
him
the
subway
of
one
of
the
metropolitan
stations
he
probably
forgotten
the
echoes
when
he
taken
the
train
but
of
course
the
railway
folk
wo
let
a
man
who
happens
to
dislike
echoes
go
wandering
across
the
metals
where
he
likes
he
was
twenty
yards
ahead
when
i
saw
him
i
recognised
him
by
his
patched
head
and
black
i
ran
along
the
subway
after
him
it
was
very
curious
he
been
walking
close
to
the
wall
and
i
saw
him
suddenly
stop
but
he
did
turn
he
did
even
turn
when
i
pulled
up
close
behind
him
he
put
out
one
hand
to
the
wall
as
if
to
steady
himself
but
the
moment
i
touched
his
shoulder
he
just
dropped
just
dropped
half
on
his
knees
against
the
white
tiling
the
face
he
turned
round
and
up
to
me
was
transfixed
with
fright
there
were
half
a
hundred
people
about
a
train
was
just
in
and
it
a
difficult
matter
in
london
to
get
a
crowd
for
much
less
than
a
man
crouching
terrified
against
a
wall
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
rooum
looked
at
another
man
almost
as
terrified
i
felt
somebody
hand
on
my
own
arm
evidently
somebody
thought
i
knocked
rooum
down
the
terror
went
slowly
from
his
face
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
i
shook
myself
free
of
the
man
who
held
me
and
stepped
up
to
rooum
what
the
devil
all
this
about
i
demanded
roughly
enough
it
all
right
it
all
right
he
stammered
heavens
man
you
should
play
tricks
like
that
no
no
but
for
the
love
of
god
do
do
it
again
we
not
explain
here
i
said
still
in
a
good
deal
of
a
huff
and
the
small
crowd
melted
away
disappointed
i
dare
say
that
it
a
fight
now
i
said
when
we
were
outside
in
the
crowded
street
you
might
let
me
know
what
all
this
is
about
and
what
it
is
that
for
the
love
of
god
i
not
to
do
again
he
was
half
apologetic
but
at
the
same
time
half
blustering
as
if
i
had
committed
some
sort
of
an
outrage
a
senseless
thing
like
that
he
mumbled
to
himself
but
there
you
did
know
you
know
do
you
i
tell
you
hear
not
to
run
at
all
when
i
you
a
nice
fellow
and
all
that
and
get
your
quantities
somewhere
near
right
if
you
do
go
a
long
way
round
to
do
it
but
i
not
answer
for
myself
if
you
run
hear
putting
your
hand
on
a
man
shoulder
like
that
just
when
certainly
i
might
have
spoken
i
agreed
a
little
stiffly
of
course
you
ought
to
have
spoken
just
you
see
you
do
do
it
again
it
monstrous
i
put
a
curt
question
are
you
sure
you
quite
right
in
your
head
rooum
ah
he
cried
do
you
think
i
just
fancy
it
my
lad
nothing
so
easy
i
thought
you
guessed
that
other
time
on
the
new
road
it
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
no
no
no
shall
be
telling
something
about
molecules
one
of
these
days
we
walked
for
a
time
in
silence
suddenly
he
asked
what
are
you
doing
now
i
myself
do
you
mean
oh
the
firm
a
railway
job
past
pinner
but
we
a
big
contract
coming
on
in
the
west
end
soon
they
might
want
you
for
they
call
it
but
it
one
of
these
big
i
come
along
oh
it
is
for
a
month
or
two
yet
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
i
come
along
to
pinner
with
you
now
or
whenever
you
go
oh
i
said
i
do
know
that
i
specially
wanted
him
it
a
little
wearing
the
company
of
a
chap
like
that
you
never
know
what
he
going
to
let
you
in
for
next
but
as
this
did
seem
to
occur
to
him
i
did
say
anything
if
he
really
liked
catching
the
last
train
down
a
walk
and
then
sharing
a
room
at
a
poor
sort
of
alehouse
which
was
my
own
programme
he
was
welcome
we
walked
a
little
farther
then
i
told
him
the
time
of
the
train
and
left
him
he
turned
up
at
euston
a
little
after
twelve
we
went
down
together
it
was
getting
on
for
one
when
we
left
the
station
at
the
other
end
and
then
we
began
the
tramp
across
the
weald
to
the
inn
a
little
to
my
surprise
for
i
had
begun
to
expect
unaccountable
behaviour
from
him
we
reached
the
inn
without
rooum
having
dodged
about
changing
places
with
me
or
having
fallen
cowering
under
a
or
anything
of
that
kind
our
talk
too
was
about
work
not
molecules
and
osmosis
the
inn
was
only
a
roadside
beerhouse
i
have
forgotten
its
name
and
all
its
sleeping
accomodation
was
the
one
room
over
the
head
of
my
own
bed
the
ceiling
was
cut
away
following
the
and
the
wallpaper
was
perfectly
shocking
faded
bouquets
that
made
v
and
a
interlacing
everywhere
the
other
bed
was
made
up
and
lay
across
the
room
i
think
i
only
spoke
once
while
we
were
making
ready
for
bed
and
that
was
when
rooum
took
from
his
black
a
brush
and
a
torn
nightgown
that
what
you
always
carry
about
is
it
i
remarked
and
rooum
grunted
something
yes
never
knew
where
you
be
next
no
harm
was
it
we
tumbled
into
bed
but
for
all
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
was
sleepy
so
from
my
own
bag
i
took
a
book
set
the
candle
on
the
end
of
the
mantel
and
began
to
read
mark
you
i
do
say
i
was
much
better
informed
for
the
reading
i
did
for
i
was
watching
the
v
on
the
wallpaper
mostly
that
and
wondering
what
was
wrong
with
the
man
in
the
other
bed
who
had
fallen
down
at
a
touch
in
the
subway
he
was
already
asleep
now
i
do
know
whether
i
can
make
the
next
clear
to
you
i
quite
certain
he
was
sound
asleep
so
that
it
was
just
the
fact
that
he
spoke
even
that
is
a
little
unpleasant
i
always
think
any
sort
of
but
it
a
very
queer
sort
of
sensation
when
a
man
actually
answers
a
question
that
put
to
him
knowing
nothing
whatever
about
it
in
the
morning
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
put
that
question
having
put
it
i
did
the
next
best
thing
afterwards
as
you
see
in
a
moment
but
let
me
tell
you
he
been
asleep
perhaps
an
hour
and
i
woolgathering
about
the
wallpaper
when
suddenly
in
a
far
more
clear
and
loud
voice
than
he
ever
used
when
awake
he
said
what
the
devil
is
it
prevents
me
seeing
him
then
that
startled
me
rather
for
the
second
time
that
evening
and
i
really
think
i
had
spoken
before
i
had
fully
realised
what
was
happening
from
seeing
whom
i
said
sitting
up
in
bed
whom
you
not
attending
the
fellow
i
telling
you
about
who
runs
after
me
he
answered
answered
perfectly
plainly
i
could
see
his
head
there
on
the
pillow
black
and
white
and
his
eyes
were
closed
he
made
a
slight
movement
with
his
arm
but
that
did
not
wake
him
then
it
came
to
me
with
a
sort
of
start
what
was
happening
i
slipped
half
out
of
bed
would
he
would
he
answer
another
question
i
risked
it
breathlessly
have
you
any
idea
who
he
is
well
that
too
he
answered
who
he
is
the
runner
do
be
silly
else
should
it
be
with
every
nerve
in
me
tingling
i
tried
again
what
happens
then
when
he
catches
you
this
time
i
really
do
know
whether
his
words
were
an
answer
or
not
they
were
these
to
hear
him
catching
you
up
and
then
padding
away
ahead
again
all
right
all
right
but
i
guess
it
weakening
him
a
bit
too
without
noticing
it
i
had
got
out
of
bed
and
had
advanced
quite
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
i
breathed
but
that
was
a
dead
failure
he
muttered
brokenly
for
a
moment
gave
a
deep
troubled
sigh
and
then
began
to
snore
loudly
and
regularly
i
made
my
way
back
to
bed
but
i
assure
you
that
before
i
did
so
i
filled
my
basin
with
water
dipped
my
face
into
it
and
then
set
the
candlestick
afloat
in
it
leaving
the
candle
burning
i
thought
i
like
to
have
a
light
it
had
burned
down
by
morning
rooum
i
remember
remarked
on
the
silly
practice
of
reading
in
bed
well
it
was
a
pretty
kind
of
obsession
for
a
man
to
have
was
it
somebody
running
after
him
all
the
time
and
then
running
on
ahead
and
of
course
on
a
broad
pavement
there
would
be
plenty
of
room
for
this
running
gentleman
to
run
round
but
on
an
or
kerb
such
as
that
of
the
new
road
out
lewisham
way
but
perhaps
he
was
a
jumping
gentleman
too
and
could
jump
over
a
man
head
you
think
have
to
get
past
some
way
would
you
i
remember
vaguely
wondering
whether
the
name
of
that
runner
was
not
conscience
but
conscience
a
matter
of
molecules
and
osmosis
one
thing
however
was
clear
i
got
to
tell
rooum
what
i
learned
for
you
ca
get
hold
of
a
fellow
secrets
in
ways
like
that
i
lost
no
time
about
it
i
told
him
in
fact
soon
after
we
left
the
inn
the
next
morning
told
him
how
he
answered
in
his
sleep
and
what
do
you
think
of
this
he
seemed
to
think
i
ought
to
have
guessed
it
a
monstrous
thing
like
that
you
less
clever
than
i
thought
with
your
books
and
that
if
you
did
he
grunted
but
good
god
man
queer
is
it
but
you
do
know
the
queerest
he
pondered
for
a
moment
and
then
suddenly
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
i
tell
you
he
whispered
gets
harder
every
at
first
he
just
slipped
through
a
bit
of
a
catch
at
my
heart
like
when
you
nod
off
to
sleep
in
a
chair
and
jerk
up
awake
again
and
away
he
went
but
now
it
getting
grinding
sluggish
and
the
pain
you
notice
that
night
on
the
road
the
little
check
it
gave
me
that
past
long
since
and
last
night
when
i
just
braced
myself
up
stiff
to
meet
it
and
you
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
he
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
over
his
brow
i
tell
you
he
continued
it
an
agony
each
time
i
could
scream
at
the
thought
of
it
it
oftener
too
now
and
he
getting
stronger
the
is
getting
to
be
is
that
right
just
let
me
tell
you
one
more
thing
but
i
had
enough
i
asked
questions
the
night
before
but
now
well
i
knew
quite
as
much
as
and
more
than
i
wanted
stop
please
i
said
you
either
off
your
head
or
worse
call
it
the
first
do
tell
me
any
more
please
frightened
what
well
i
do
blame
you
but
what
would
do
i
should
see
a
doctor
i
only
an
engineer
i
replied
doctors
bah
he
said
and
spat
i
hope
you
see
how
the
matter
stood
with
rooum
what
do
you
make
of
it
could
you
have
believed
it
you
believe
it
he
made
a
nearish
guess
when
he
said
that
much
of
our
knowledge
is
giving
names
to
things
we
know
nothing
about
only
physics
thinks
explained
in
the
manual
and
you
always
got
to
remember
one
thing
you
can
call
it
force
or
what
you
like
but
it
a
certainty
that
things
solid
things
of
wood
and
iron
and
stone
would
explode
just
go
off
in
a
puff
into
space
if
it
was
for
something
just
as
inexplicable
as
that
that
rooum
said
he
felt
in
his
own
person
and
if
you
can
swallow
that
it
a
relatively
small
matter
whether
rooum
familiar
slipped
through
him
unperceived
or
had
to
struggle
through
obstinately
you
see
now
why
i
said
that
a
queer
thing
overtook
rooum
more
i
saw
it
this
thing
that
outrages
reason
i
saw
it
happen
that
is
to
say
i
saw
its
effects
and
it
was
in
broad
daylight
on
an
ordinary
afternoon
in
the
middle
of
oxford
street
of
all
places
there
was
a
shadow
of
doubt
about
it
people
were
pressing
and
jostling
about
him
and
suddenly
i
saw
him
turn
his
head
and
listen
as
i
seen
him
before
i
tell
you
an
icy
creeping
ran
all
over
my
skin
i
fancied
i
felt
it
approaching
too
nearer
and
nearer
the
next
moment
he
had
made
a
sort
of
gathering
of
himself
as
if
against
a
gust
he
stumbled
and
thrust
thrust
with
his
body
he
swayed
physically
as
a
tree
sways
in
a
wind
he
clutched
my
arm
and
gave
a
loud
scream
then
after
seconds
minutes
i
do
know
how
long
he
was
free
again
and
for
the
colour
of
his
face
when
i
glanced
at
it
well
i
once
saw
a
swarthy
italian
fall
under
a
sunstroke
and
face
was
much
the
same
colour
that
rooum
negro
face
had
gone
a
cloudy
whitish
green
well
you
seen
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
gasped
presently
turning
a
ghastly
grin
on
me
but
it
was
night
before
the
full
horror
of
it
had
soaked
into
me
soon
after
that
he
disappeared
again
i
was
sorry
our
big
contract
in
the
west
end
came
on
it
was
a
with
all
manner
of
penalty
clauses
if
we
did
get
through
and
i
assure
you
that
we
were
busy
i
myself
was
far
too
busy
to
think
of
rooum
it
a
shop
now
the
place
we
were
working
at
or
rather
one
of
these
huge
weldings
of
fifty
shops
where
you
can
buy
anything
and
if
seen
us
there
but
perhaps
you
did
see
us
for
people
stood
up
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
as
they
passed
to
look
over
the
hoarding
into
the
great
excavation
we
made
it
was
a
sight
staging
rose
on
staging
tier
on
tier
with
interminable
ladders
all
over
the
steel
structure
three
or
four
squat
otis
lifts
crouched
like
iron
turtles
on
top
and
a
on
a
towering
platform
rose
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
into
the
air
at
one
end
of
the
vast
quarry
was
a
demolished
house
showing
flues
and
fireplaces
and
a
score
of
thicknesses
of
old
wallpaper
and
at
night
they
might
well
have
stood
up
on
the
tops
of
the
buses
a
dozen
great
spluttering
violet
you
down
below
were
the
watchmen
fires
overhead
the
riveters
had
their
and
in
odd
corners
guttered
and
flared
and
the
steel
rang
with
the
riveters
hammers
and
the
rattled
and
clashed
there
not
much
doubt
in
mind
it
the
engineers
who
are
the
architects
nowadays
the
chaps
who
think
they
the
architects
are
only
a
sort
of
paperhangers
who
hang
brick
and
on
our
work
and
clap
a
pinnacle
or
two
on
top
but
never
mind
that
there
we
were
sweating
and
clanging
and
navvying
till
the
day
shift
came
to
relieve
us
and
i
ought
to
say
that
fifty
feet
above
our
great
gap
and
from
end
to
end
across
it
there
ran
a
travelling
crane
on
a
skeleton
line
with
platform
engine
and
wooden
cab
all
compact
in
one
it
happened
that
they
had
pitched
in
as
one
of
the
foremen
some
fellow
or
other
a
friend
of
the
firm
a
rank
duffer
who
pestered
me
incessantly
with
his
questions
i
did
half
his
work
and
all
my
own
and
it
improved
my
temper
much
on
this
night
that
i
telling
about
he
been
playing
the
fool
with
his
questions
as
if
a
was
a
sort
of
summer
holiday
and
he
filled
me
up
to
that
point
that
i
really
say
just
when
it
was
that
rooum
put
in
an
appearance
again
i
think
i
had
heard
somebody
mention
his
name
but
i
paid
no
attention
well
our
johnnie
fresh
came
up
to
me
for
the
twentieth
time
that
night
this
time
wanting
to
know
something
about
the
overhead
crane
at
that
i
fairly
lost
my
temper
what
ails
the
crane
i
cried
it
doing
its
work
is
it
everybody
doing
their
work
except
you
why
ca
you
ask
hopkins
hopkins
there
i
do
know
he
said
then
i
snapped
in
that
particular
i
as
ignorant
as
you
and
i
hope
it
the
only
one
but
he
grabbed
my
arm
look
at
it
now
he
cried
pointing
and
i
looked
up
either
hopkins
or
somebody
was
dangerously
exceeding
the
the
thing
was
flying
along
its
thirty
yards
of
rail
as
fast
as
a
tram
and
the
heavy
swung
like
a
ponderous
thirty
feet
below
as
i
watched
the
engine
brought
up
within
a
yard
of
the
end
of
the
way
the
blocks
crashed
like
a
ram
into
the
broken
house
end
fetching
down
plaster
and
brick
and
then
the
mechanism
was
reversed
the
crane
set
off
at
a
tear
back
who
in
hell
i
began
but
it
was
a
time
to
talk
i
yelled
and
made
a
spring
for
a
ladder
the
others
had
noticed
it
too
for
there
were
shouts
all
over
the
place
by
that
time
i
was
halfway
up
the
second
stage
again
the
crane
tore
past
with
the
massive
tackle
sweeping
behind
it
and
again
i
heard
the
crash
at
the
other
end
whoever
had
the
handling
of
it
was
managing
it
skilfully
for
there
was
barely
a
foot
to
spare
when
it
turned
again
on
the
fourth
platform
at
the
end
of
the
way
i
found
hopkins
he
was
white
and
seemed
to
be
counting
on
his
fingers
what
the
matter
here
i
cried
it
rooum
he
answered
i
had
stepped
out
of
the
cab
not
a
minute
when
i
heard
the
lever
go
he
running
somebody
down
he
says
he
run
the
whole
shoot
down
in
a
minute
look
the
crane
was
coming
back
again
half
out
of
the
cab
i
could
see
mottled
hair
and
beard
his
brow
was
ribbed
like
a
gridiron
and
as
he
ripped
past
one
of
the
arcs
his
face
shone
like
porcelain
with
the
sweat
that
bathed
it
now
you
now
damn
you
he
was
shouting
get
ready
to
board
him
when
he
reverses
i
shouted
to
hopkins
just
how
we
scrambled
on
i
do
know
i
got
one
arm
over
the
which
of
course
was
going
and
heard
hopkins
on
the
other
footplate
rooum
put
the
brakes
down
and
reversed
again
came
the
thud
of
the
and
we
were
speeding
back
again
over
the
gulf
of
misty
orange
light
the
stagings
were
thronged
with
gaping
men
ready
now
i
cried
to
hopkins
and
we
sprang
into
the
cab
hopkins
hit
rooum
wrist
with
a
spanner
then
he
seized
the
lever
jammed
the
brake
down
and
tripped
rooum
all
as
it
seemed
in
one
movement
i
fell
on
top
of
rooum
the
crane
came
to
a
standstill
down
the
line
i
held
rooum
panting
but
either
rooum
was
stronger
than
i
or
else
he
took
me
very
much
unawares
all
at
once
he
twisted
clear
from
my
grasp
and
stumbled
on
his
knees
to
the
rear
door
of
the
cab
he
threw
up
one
elbow
and
staggered
to
his
feet
as
i
made
another
clutch
at
him
keep
still
you
fool
i
bawled
hit
him
over
the
head
hopkins
rooum
screamed
in
a
high
voice
run
him
down
cut
him
up
with
the
wheels
down
you
down
i
say
oh
my
god
he
sprang
clear
out
from
the
crane
door
taking
me
with
him
i
told
you
it
was
a
skeleton
line
two
rails
and
a
tie
or
two
actually
jumped
to
the
rail
and
he
was
running
along
it
running
along
that
iron
tightrope
out
over
that
well
of
light
and
watching
men
hopkins
had
started
the
as
if
with
some
insane
idea
of
catching
him
but
there
was
only
one
possible
end
to
it
he
gone
fully
a
dozen
yards
while
i
watched
horribly
fascinated
and
then
i
saw
the
turn
of
his
head
he
did
meet
it
this
time
he
sprang
to
the
other
rail
as
if
to
evade
it
even
at
the
he
missed
as
far
as
i
could
see
he
made
no
attempt
to
save
himself
with
his
hands
he
just
went
down
out
of
the
field
of
my
vision
there
was
an
awful
silence
then
from
far
below
they
were
the
men
on
the
lower
stages
who
moved
first
the
men
above
went
a
little
way
down
and
then
they
too
stopped
presently
two
of
them
descended
but
by
a
distant
way
they
returned
with
two
bottles
of
brandy
and
there
was
a
hasty
consultation
two
men
drank
the
brandy
off
there
and
then
getting
on
for
a
pint
of
brandy
apiece
then
they
went
down
drunk
i
hopkins
tells
me
had
got
down
on
my
knees
in
the
crane
cab
and
was
jabbering
away
cheerfully
to
myself
when
i
asked
him
what
i
said
he
hesitated
and
then
said
oh
you
do
want
to
know
that
sir
and
i
have
asked
him
since
what
do
make
of
it
benlian
i
it
would
be
different
if
you
had
known
benlian
it
would
be
different
if
you
had
had
even
that
glimpse
of
him
that
i
had
the
very
first
time
i
saw
him
standing
on
the
little
wooden
landing
at
the
top
of
the
flight
of
steps
outside
my
studio
door
i
say
studio
but
really
it
was
just
a
sort
of
loft
looking
out
over
the
and
i
used
it
as
a
studio
the
real
studio
the
big
one
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
yard
and
that
was
benlian
scarcely
anybody
ever
came
there
i
wondered
many
a
time
if
the
was
dead
or
had
lost
his
memory
and
forgotten
all
about
his
business
for
his
stacks
of
floorboards
set
to
season
you
know
how
they
pile
them
up
were
grimy
with
soot
and
nobody
ever
disturbed
the
rows
of
that
stood
like
palisades
along
the
walls
the
entrance
was
from
the
street
through
a
door
in
a
billposter
hoarding
and
on
the
river
not
far
away
the
steamboats
hooted
and
in
windy
weather
the
floorboards
hummed
to
keep
them
company
i
suppose
some
of
these
real
regular
artists
would
have
called
me
an
artist
at
all
for
i
only
painted
miniatures
and
it
was
at
that
copied
from
photographs
and
so
on
not
that
i
was
jolly
good
at
it
and
punctual
too
lots
of
these
artists
have
simply
no
idea
of
punctuality
and
the
loft
was
cheap
and
suited
me
very
well
but
of
course
a
sculptor
wants
a
big
place
on
the
ground
floor
slow
work
that
with
blocks
of
stone
and
marble
that
cost
you
twenty
pounds
every
time
you
lift
them
so
benlian
had
the
studio
his
name
was
on
a
plate
on
the
door
but
i
never
seen
him
till
this
time
i
telling
you
of
i
was
working
that
evening
at
one
of
the
prettiest
little
things
i
ever
done
a
girl
head
on
ivory
that
i
stippled
up
just
like
oh
you
never
have
thought
it
was
done
by
hand
at
all
the
daylight
had
gone
but
i
knew
that
prussian
would
be
about
the
colour
for
the
eyes
and
the
bunch
of
flowers
at
her
breast
and
i
wanted
to
finish
i
was
working
at
my
little
table
with
a
shade
over
my
eyes
and
i
jumped
a
bit
when
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
not
having
heard
anybody
come
up
the
steps
and
not
having
many
visitors
anyway
letters
were
always
put
into
the
box
in
the
yard
door
when
i
opened
the
door
there
he
stood
on
the
platform
and
i
gave
a
bit
of
a
start
having
come
straight
from
my
ivory
you
see
he
was
one
of
these
very
tall
gaunt
chaps
that
make
us
little
fellows
feel
even
smaller
than
we
are
and
i
wondered
at
first
where
his
eyes
were
they
were
set
so
deep
in
the
dark
caves
on
either
side
of
his
nose
like
a
skull
his
head
was
i
could
fancy
his
teeth
curving
round
inside
his
cheeks
and
his
zygomatics
stuck
up
under
his
skin
like
razorbacks
but
if
you
not
one
of
us
artists
you
not
understand
that
a
bit
of
smoky
greenish
sky
showed
behind
him
and
then
as
his
eyes
moved
in
their
big
pits
one
of
them
caught
the
light
of
my
lamp
and
flashed
like
a
well
of
lustre
he
spoke
abruptly
in
a
deep
shaky
sort
of
voice
i
want
you
to
photograph
me
in
the
morning
he
said
i
supposed
seen
my
out
on
the
some
time
or
other
come
in
i
said
but
i
afraid
if
it
a
miniature
you
want
that
i
retained
my
firm
retains
me
you
have
to
do
it
through
them
but
come
in
and
i
show
you
the
kind
of
thing
i
do
though
you
ought
to
have
come
in
the
daylight
he
came
in
he
was
wearing
a
long
grey
that
came
right
down
to
his
heels
and
made
him
look
something
like
a
figure
seen
in
the
light
his
face
seemed
more
ghastly
bony
still
and
as
he
glanced
for
a
moment
at
my
little
ivory
he
made
a
sound
of
contempt
i
know
it
was
contempt
i
thought
it
rather
cheek
coming
into
my
place
and
he
turned
his
cavernous
eyeholes
on
me
i
do
want
anything
of
that
sort
i
want
you
to
photograph
me
i
be
here
at
ten
in
the
morning
so
just
to
show
him
that
i
was
to
be
treated
that
way
i
said
quite
shortly
i
ca
i
an
appointment
at
ten
what
that
he
said
he
one
of
these
rich
deep
voices
that
always
sound
consumptive
take
that
thing
off
your
eyes
and
look
at
me
he
ordered
well
i
was
awfully
indignant
if
you
think
i
going
to
be
told
to
do
things
like
this
i
began
take
that
thing
off
he
just
ordered
again
i
got
to
remember
of
course
that
you
did
know
benlian
then
and
for
a
chap
just
to
stalk
into
a
fellow
place
and
tell
him
to
photograph
him
and
order
him
about
but
you
see
in
a
minute
i
took
the
shade
off
my
eyes
just
to
show
him
that
could
browbeat
a
bit
too
i
used
to
have
a
tall
strip
of
leaning
against
my
wall
for
though
i
did
use
models
much
it
awfully
useful
to
go
to
nature
for
odd
bits
now
and
then
and
i
sketched
myself
in
that
glass
oh
hundreds
of
times
we
must
have
been
standing
in
front
of
it
for
all
at
once
i
saw
the
eyes
at
the
bottom
of
his
pits
looking
rigidly
over
my
shoulder
without
moving
his
eyes
from
the
glass
and
scarcely
moving
his
lips
he
muttered
get
me
a
pair
of
gloves
get
me
a
pair
of
gloves
it
was
a
funny
thing
to
ask
for
but
i
got
him
a
pair
of
my
gloves
from
a
drawer
his
hands
were
shaking
so
that
he
could
hardly
get
them
on
and
there
was
a
little
glistening
of
sweat
on
his
face
that
looked
like
the
salt
that
dries
on
you
when
you
been
bathing
in
the
sea
then
i
turned
to
see
what
it
was
that
he
was
looking
so
earnestly
and
profoundly
at
in
the
mirror
i
saw
nothing
except
just
the
pair
of
us
he
with
my
gloves
on
he
stepped
aside
and
slowly
drew
the
gloves
off
i
think
could
have
bullied
just
then
he
turned
to
me
did
that
look
all
right
to
you
he
asked
why
my
dear
chap
whatever
ails
you
i
cried
i
suppose
he
went
on
you
could
photograph
me
now
i
could
have
done
with
magnesium
but
i
had
a
scrap
in
the
place
i
told
him
so
he
was
looking
round
my
studio
he
saw
my
camera
standing
in
a
corner
ah
he
said
he
made
a
stride
towards
it
he
unscrewed
the
lens
brought
it
to
the
lamp
and
peered
attentively
through
it
now
into
the
air
now
at
his
sleeve
and
hand
as
if
looking
for
a
flaw
in
it
then
he
replaced
it
and
pulled
up
the
collar
of
his
as
if
he
was
cold
well
another
night
of
it
he
muttered
but
he
added
facing
suddenly
round
on
me
if
your
appointment
was
to
meet
your
god
himself
you
must
photograph
me
at
ten
morning
all
right
i
said
giving
in
for
he
seemed
horribly
ill
draw
up
to
the
stove
and
have
a
drink
of
something
and
a
smoke
i
neither
drink
nor
smoke
he
replied
moving
towards
the
door
sit
down
and
have
a
chat
then
i
urged
for
i
always
like
to
be
decent
with
fellows
and
it
was
a
lonely
sort
of
place
that
yard
he
shook
his
head
be
ready
by
ten
in
the
morning
he
said
and
he
passed
down
my
stairs
and
crossed
the
yard
to
his
studio
without
even
having
said
good
night
well
he
was
at
my
door
again
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
i
photographed
him
i
made
three
exposures
but
the
plates
were
some
that
i
had
in
the
place
for
some
time
and
they
gone
off
and
fogged
in
the
developing
i
awfully
sorry
i
said
but
i
going
out
this
afternoon
and
will
get
some
more
and
we
have
another
shot
in
the
morning
one
after
the
other
he
was
holding
the
negatives
up
to
the
light
and
examining
them
presently
he
put
them
down
quietly
leaning
them
methodically
up
against
the
edge
of
the
never
mind
it
does
matter
thank
you
he
said
and
left
me
after
that
i
did
see
him
for
weeks
but
at
nights
i
could
see
the
light
of
his
shining
through
the
wreathing
and
sometimes
i
heard
him
moving
about
and
the
muffled
of
his
hammer
on
marble
ii
of
course
i
did
see
him
again
or
i
should
be
telling
you
all
this
he
came
to
my
door
just
as
he
had
done
before
and
at
about
the
same
time
in
the
evening
he
had
come
to
be
photographed
this
time
but
for
all
that
it
was
something
about
a
camera
something
he
wanted
to
know
brought
two
books
with
him
big
books
printed
in
german
they
were
on
light
he
said
and
physics
or
else
it
was
psychics
i
always
get
those
two
words
wrong
they
were
full
of
diagrams
and
equations
and
figures
and
of
course
it
was
all
miles
above
my
head
he
talked
a
lot
about
whatever
that
is
and
at
first
i
nodded
as
if
i
knew
all
about
it
but
he
very
soon
saw
that
i
did
and
he
came
down
to
my
level
again
what
he
come
to
ask
me
was
this
did
i
know
anything
of
my
own
experience
about
things
photographing
through
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
a
name
that
been
painted
out
on
a
board
say
comes
up
in
the
plate
well
as
it
happened
i
once
photographed
a
drawing
for
a
fellow
and
the
easel
i
had
stood
it
on
had
come
up
through
the
picture
and
i
knew
by
the
way
benlian
nodded
that
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
meant
more
he
said
i
told
him
i
once
seen
a
photograph
of
a
man
with
a
bowler
hat
on
and
the
shape
of
his
crown
had
showed
through
the
hat
yes
yes
he
said
musing
and
then
he
asked
have
you
ever
heard
of
things
not
photographing
at
all
but
i
could
tell
him
anything
about
that
and
off
he
started
again
about
light
and
physics
and
so
on
then
as
soon
as
i
could
get
a
word
in
i
said
but
of
course
the
camera
is
art
some
of
my
miniatures
you
understand
were
jolly
nice
little
things
no
no
he
murmured
absently
and
then
abruptly
he
said
eh
that
and
what
the
devil
do
know
about
it
well
said
i
in
a
dignified
sort
of
way
considering
that
for
ten
years
i
been
chut
hold
your
tongue
he
said
turning
away
there
he
was
talking
to
me
again
just
as
if
i
asked
him
in
to
bully
me
but
you
got
to
be
decent
to
a
fellow
when
he
in
your
own
place
and
i
asked
him
but
in
a
cold
sort
of
way
how
his
own
work
was
going
on
he
turned
to
me
again
would
you
like
to
see
it
he
asked
thought
i
he
got
to
a
with
his
work
it
all
very
well
i
thought
for
you
to
sniff
at
my
miniatures
my
friend
but
we
all
get
stale
on
our
work
sometimes
and
the
fresh
eye
even
of
a
i
shall
be
glad
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
you
i
answered
still
a
bit
huffish
but
bearing
no
malice
then
come
he
said
we
descended
and
crossed
the
and
he
held
his
door
open
for
me
to
pass
in
it
was
an
enormous
great
place
his
studio
and
all
full
of
mist
and
the
gallery
that
was
his
bedroom
was
up
a
little
staircase
at
the
farther
end
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
was
a
tall
structure
of
scaffolding
with
a
stage
or
two
to
stand
on
and
i
could
see
the
dim
ghostly
marble
figure
in
the
gloom
it
had
been
jacked
up
on
a
heavy
base
and
as
it
would
have
taken
three
or
four
men
to
put
it
into
position
and
scarcely
a
stranger
had
entered
the
yard
since
i
had
been
there
i
knew
that
the
figure
must
have
stood
for
a
long
time
sculpture
weary
slow
work
benlian
was
pottering
about
with
a
taper
at
the
end
of
a
long
rod
and
suddenly
the
overhead
burst
into
light
i
placed
myself
before
the
statue
to
criticise
you
know
well
it
did
seem
to
me
that
he
needed
to
have
turned
up
his
nose
at
my
ivories
for
i
did
think
much
of
his
statue
except
that
it
was
a
great
lumping
extraordinary
piece
of
work
it
had
an
outstretched
arm
that
i
remember
thinking
was
absolutely
misshapen
disproportioned
big
enough
for
a
giant
ridiculously
out
of
drawing
and
as
i
looked
at
the
thing
this
way
and
that
i
knew
that
his
eyes
in
their
deep
cellars
never
left
my
face
for
a
moment
it
a
god
he
said
then
i
began
to
tell
him
about
that
monstrous
arm
but
he
cut
me
very
short
i
say
it
a
god
he
interrupted
looking
at
me
as
if
he
would
have
eaten
me
even
you
child
as
you
are
have
seen
the
gods
men
have
made
for
themselves
before
this
they
made
all
good
or
all
evil
and
then
they
called
them
the
devil
this
is
god
the
god
of
good
and
of
evil
also
er
i
see
i
said
rather
taken
aback
but
quite
sure
he
was
off
his
head
for
all
that
then
i
looked
at
the
arm
again
a
child
could
have
seen
how
wrong
it
was
but
suddenly
to
my
amazement
he
took
me
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
me
away
that
do
he
said
curtly
i
did
ask
you
to
come
in
here
with
a
view
to
learning
anything
from
you
i
wanted
to
see
how
it
struck
you
i
shall
send
for
you
again
and
again
then
he
began
to
jabber
half
to
himself
bah
he
muttered
that
all
they
ask
before
a
stupendous
thing
show
them
the
ocean
the
heavens
infinity
and
they
ask
that
all
if
they
saw
their
god
face
to
face
they
ask
it
there
only
one
cause
that
works
now
in
good
and
now
in
evil
but
show
it
to
them
and
they
put
their
heads
on
one
side
and
begin
to
appraise
and
patronise
it
i
tell
you
what
seen
at
a
glance
flies
away
at
a
glance
gods
come
slowly
over
you
but
presently
ah
they
begin
to
grip
you
and
at
the
end
there
no
fleeing
from
them
you
tell
me
more
about
my
statue
what
was
that
you
said
he
demanded
facing
swiftly
round
on
me
that
arm
ah
yes
but
we
see
what
you
say
about
that
arm
six
months
from
now
yes
the
arm
now
be
off
he
ordered
me
i
send
for
you
again
when
i
want
you
he
thrust
me
out
an
asylum
benlian
i
thought
as
i
crossed
the
yard
is
the
place
for
you
you
see
i
did
know
him
then
and
that
he
was
to
be
judged
as
an
ordinary
man
is
just
you
wait
till
you
see
and
straight
away
i
found
myself
vowing
that
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
i
found
myself
resolving
that
as
if
i
were
making
up
my
mind
not
to
smoke
or
drink
and
i
do
know
why
with
a
similar
sense
that
i
was
depriving
myself
of
something
but
somehow
i
forgot
and
within
a
month
he
been
in
several
times
to
see
me
and
once
or
twice
had
fetched
me
in
to
see
his
statue
in
two
months
i
was
in
an
extraordinary
state
of
mind
about
him
i
was
familiar
with
him
in
a
way
but
at
the
same
time
i
did
know
one
scrap
more
about
him
because
i
a
fool
oh
yes
i
know
quite
well
now
what
i
am
you
think
i
talking
folly
if
i
even
begin
to
tell
you
what
sort
of
a
man
he
was
i
do
mean
just
his
knowledge
though
i
think
he
knew
everything
sciences
languages
and
all
that
for
it
was
far
more
than
that
somehow
when
he
was
there
he
had
me
all
restless
and
uneasy
and
when
he
was
there
i
was
there
only
the
one
word
for
it
jealous
as
jealous
as
if
he
been
a
girl
even
yet
i
ca
make
it
out
and
he
knew
how
unsettled
he
got
me
and
i
tell
you
how
i
found
that
out
straight
out
one
night
when
he
was
sitting
up
in
my
place
he
asked
me
do
you
like
me
pudgie
i
forgot
to
say
that
i
told
him
they
used
to
call
me
pudgie
at
home
because
i
was
little
and
fat
it
was
odd
the
number
of
things
i
told
him
that
i
would
have
told
anybody
else
do
you
like
me
pudgie
he
said
as
for
my
answer
i
do
know
how
it
spurted
out
i
was
much
more
surprised
than
he
was
for
i
really
did
intend
it
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
if
somebody
else
was
talking
with
my
mouth
loathe
and
adore
you
it
came
and
then
i
looked
round
awfully
startled
to
hear
myself
saying
that
but
he
did
look
at
me
he
only
nodded
yes
of
good
and
evil
too
he
muttered
to
himself
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
got
up
and
went
out
i
did
sleep
for
ever
so
long
after
that
thinking
how
odd
it
was
i
should
have
said
that
well
to
get
on
after
that
something
i
could
account
for
began
to
come
over
me
sometimes
as
i
worked
it
began
to
come
over
me
without
any
warning
that
he
was
thinking
of
me
down
there
across
the
yard
i
used
to
this
must
sound
awfully
silly
to
you
that
he
was
down
yonder
thinking
of
me
and
doing
something
to
me
and
one
night
i
was
so
sure
that
it
was
fancy
that
i
jumped
straight
up
from
my
work
and
i
not
quite
sure
what
happened
then
until
i
found
myself
in
his
studio
just
as
if
i
walked
there
in
my
sleep
and
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
me
for
there
was
a
chair
by
his
own
in
front
of
the
statue
what
is
it
benlian
i
burst
out
ah
he
said
well
it
about
that
arm
pudgie
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
the
arm
does
it
look
so
strange
as
it
did
no
i
said
i
thought
it
would
he
observed
but
i
have
touched
it
pudgie
so
i
stayed
the
evening
there
but
you
must
not
think
he
was
always
doing
that
thing
whatever
it
was
to
me
on
the
other
hand
i
sometimes
felt
the
oddest
sort
of
release
i
do
know
how
else
to
put
it
like
when
on
one
of
these
muggy
days
when
everything
melancholy
the
wind
freshens
up
suddenly
and
you
breathe
again
and
that
i
trying
to
take
it
in
order
you
see
so
that
it
will
be
plain
to
you
brings
me
to
the
time
i
found
out
that
did
that
too
and
knew
when
he
was
doing
it
i
gone
into
his
place
one
night
to
have
a
look
at
his
statue
it
was
surprising
what
a
lot
i
was
finding
out
about
that
statue
it
was
still
all
out
of
proportion
that
is
to
say
i
knew
it
must
be
remembered
thought
so
though
it
did
annoy
me
now
quite
so
much
i
suppose
lost
fresh
eye
by
that
time
somehow
too
my
own
miniatures
had
begun
to
look
a
bit
kiddish
they
made
me
impatient
and
that
horrible
to
be
discontented
with
things
that
once
seemed
jolly
good
to
you
well
he
been
looking
at
me
in
the
hungriest
sort
of
way
and
i
looking
at
the
statue
when
all
at
once
that
feeling
of
release
and
lightness
came
over
me
the
first
i
knew
of
it
was
that
i
found
myself
thinking
of
some
rather
important
letters
my
firm
had
written
to
me
wanting
to
know
when
a
job
i
was
doing
was
going
to
be
finished
i
thought
myself
it
was
time
i
got
it
finished
i
thought
i
better
set
about
it
at
once
and
i
sat
suddenly
up
in
my
chair
as
if
i
just
come
out
of
a
sleep
and
looking
at
the
statue
i
saw
it
as
it
had
seemed
at
first
all
misshapen
and
out
of
drawing
the
very
next
moment
as
i
was
rising
i
sat
down
again
as
suddenly
as
if
somebody
had
pulled
me
back
now
a
chap
does
like
to
be
changed
about
like
that
so
without
looking
at
benlian
i
muttered
a
bit
testily
do
benlian
then
i
heard
him
get
up
and
knock
his
chair
away
he
was
standing
behind
me
pudgie
he
said
in
a
moved
sort
of
voice
i
no
good
to
you
get
out
of
this
get
out
no
no
benlian
i
pleaded
get
out
do
you
hear
and
do
come
again
go
and
live
somewhere
else
go
away
from
london
do
let
me
know
where
you
go
oh
what
have
i
done
i
asked
unhappily
and
he
was
muttering
again
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
me
too
he
muttered
and
then
he
added
come
bundle
out
so
in
home
i
went
and
finished
my
ivory
for
the
firm
but
i
ca
tell
you
how
friendless
and
unhappy
i
felt
now
i
used
to
know
in
those
days
a
little
girl
a
nice
little
thing
just
friendly
you
know
who
used
to
come
to
me
sometimes
in
another
place
i
lived
at
and
mend
for
me
and
so
on
it
was
an
awful
long
time
since
i
seen
her
but
she
found
me
out
one
night
came
to
that
yard
walked
straight
in
went
straight
to
my
and
began
to
look
over
my
things
to
see
what
wanted
mending
just
as
she
used
to
i
do
mind
confessing
that
i
was
a
bit
sweet
on
her
at
one
time
and
it
made
me
feel
awfully
mean
the
way
she
came
in
without
asking
any
questions
and
took
up
my
mending
so
she
sat
doing
my
things
and
i
sat
at
my
work
glad
of
a
bit
of
company
and
she
chatted
as
she
worked
just
jolly
and
gentle
and
not
at
all
reproaching
me
but
as
suddenly
as
a
shot
right
in
the
middle
of
it
all
i
found
myself
wondering
about
benlian
again
and
i
was
only
wondering
somehow
i
was
horribly
uneasy
about
him
it
came
to
me
that
he
might
be
ill
or
something
and
all
the
fun
of
her
having
come
to
see
me
was
gone
i
found
myself
doing
all
sorts
of
stupid
things
to
my
work
and
glancing
at
my
watch
that
was
lying
on
the
table
before
me
at
last
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
got
up
daisy
i
said
i
got
to
go
out
now
she
seemed
surprised
oh
why
did
you
tell
me
i
been
keeping
you
she
said
getting
up
at
once
i
muttered
that
i
was
awfully
sorry
i
packed
her
off
i
closed
the
door
in
the
hoarding
behind
her
then
i
walked
straight
across
the
yard
to
benlian
he
was
lying
on
a
couch
not
doing
anything
i
know
i
ought
to
have
come
sooner
benlian
i
said
but
i
had
somebody
with
me
yes
he
said
looking
hard
at
me
and
i
got
a
bit
red
she
awfully
nice
i
stammered
but
you
never
bother
with
girls
and
you
do
drink
or
smoke
no
he
said
well
i
continued
you
ought
to
have
a
little
relaxation
knocking
yourself
up
and
indeed
he
looked
awfully
ill
but
he
shook
his
head
a
man
only
a
definite
amount
of
force
in
him
pudgie
he
said
and
if
he
spends
it
in
one
way
he
goes
short
in
another
mine
goes
there
he
glanced
at
the
statue
i
rarely
sleep
now
he
added
then
you
ought
to
see
a
doctor
i
said
a
bit
alarmed
i
felt
sure
he
was
no
no
pudgie
my
force
is
all
going
there
all
but
the
minimum
that
ca
be
helped
you
know
you
heard
artists
talk
about
their
soul
into
their
work
pudgie
do
rub
it
in
about
my
rotten
miniatures
benlian
i
asked
him
you
heard
them
say
that
but
they
charlatans
professional
artists
all
pudgie
they
have
got
any
souls
bigger
than
a
sixpence
to
put
into
it
you
know
pudgie
that
force
and
matter
are
the
same
thing
that
it
decided
nowadays
that
you
ca
define
matter
otherwise
than
as
point
of
force
yes
i
found
myself
saying
eagerly
as
if
i
heard
it
dozens
of
times
before
so
that
if
they
could
put
their
souls
into
it
it
would
be
just
as
easy
for
them
to
put
their
into
it
i
had
drawn
very
close
to
him
and
again
it
was
not
fancy
i
felt
as
if
somebody
not
me
was
using
my
mouth
a
flash
of
comprehension
seemed
to
come
into
my
brain
that
i
cried
breathlessly
he
nodded
three
or
four
times
and
whispered
i
really
do
know
why
we
both
whispered
that
i
whispered
again
shall
i
show
you
i
tried
my
hardest
not
to
you
know
he
still
whispered
yes
show
me
i
replied
in
a
suppressed
voice
do
breathe
a
sound
then
i
keep
them
up
there
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
as
if
we
had
been
two
conspirators
then
he
tiptoed
across
the
studio
and
went
up
to
his
bedroom
in
the
gallery
presently
he
tiptoed
down
again
with
some
papers
in
his
hand
they
were
photographs
and
we
stooped
together
over
a
little
table
his
hand
shook
with
excitement
you
remember
this
he
whispered
showing
me
a
rough
print
it
was
one
of
the
prints
from
the
fogged
plates
that
i
taken
after
that
first
night
come
closer
to
me
if
you
feel
frightened
pudgie
he
said
you
said
they
were
old
plates
pudgie
no
no
the
plates
were
all
right
it
who
am
wrong
of
course
i
said
it
seemed
so
natural
this
one
he
said
taking
up
one
that
was
numbered
is
a
plain
photograph
in
the
flesh
before
it
started
know
now
look
at
this
and
this
he
spread
them
before
me
all
in
order
was
a
little
fogged
as
if
a
novice
had
taken
it
on
a
sort
of
cloudy
veil
partly
obliterated
the
face
was
still
further
smudged
and
lost
and
was
a
figure
with
gloved
hands
held
up
as
a
man
holds
his
hands
up
when
he
is
covered
by
a
gun
the
face
of
this
one
was
completely
blotted
out
and
it
did
seem
in
the
least
horrible
to
me
for
i
kept
on
murmuring
of
course
of
course
then
benlian
rubbed
his
hands
and
smiled
at
me
i
making
good
progress
am
i
not
he
said
splendid
i
breathed
better
than
you
know
too
he
chuckled
for
you
not
properly
under
yet
but
you
will
be
pudgie
you
will
be
yes
yes
will
it
be
long
benlian
no
he
replied
not
if
i
can
keep
from
eating
and
sleeping
and
thinking
of
other
things
than
the
statue
and
if
you
do
disturb
me
by
having
girls
about
the
place
pudgie
i
awfully
sorry
i
said
contritely
all
right
all
right
ssh
this
you
know
pudgie
is
my
own
studio
i
bought
it
i
bought
it
purposely
to
make
my
statue
my
god
i
passing
nicely
into
it
and
when
i
quite
passed
passed
pudgie
you
can
have
the
key
and
come
in
when
you
like
oh
thanks
awfully
i
murmured
gratefully
he
nudged
me
what
would
they
think
of
it
pudgie
those
of
the
exhibitions
and
academies
who
say
souls
are
in
their
work
what
would
the
cacklers
think
of
it
pudgie
are
they
fools
i
chuckled
and
i
shall
have
worshipper
sha
i
pudgie
rather
i
replied
is
it
splendid
oh
need
i
go
back
just
yet
yes
you
must
go
now
but
i
send
for
you
again
very
soon
you
know
i
tried
to
do
without
you
pudge
i
tried
for
thirteen
days
and
it
nearly
killed
me
that
past
i
sha
try
again
now
off
you
trot
my
pudgie
i
winked
at
him
knowingly
and
came
skipping
and
dancing
across
the
yard
iii
it
just
silly
that
what
it
is
to
say
that
something
of
a
man
does
go
into
his
work
why
even
those
wretched
little
ivories
of
mine
the
fellows
who
paid
for
them
knew
my
touch
in
them
and
once
spotted
it
instantly
when
i
tried
to
slip
in
another
chap
who
was
hard
up
benlian
used
to
say
that
a
man
went
about
spreading
himself
over
everything
he
came
in
contact
with
diffusing
some
sort
of
influence
as
far
as
i
could
make
it
out
and
the
mistake
was
he
said
that
we
went
through
the
world
just
wasting
it
instead
of
directing
it
and
if
benlian
did
understand
all
about
those
things
i
should
jolly
well
like
to
know
who
does
a
chap
with
a
great
abounding
will
and
brain
like
him
it
only
natural
he
should
be
able
to
pass
himself
on
to
a
statue
or
anything
else
when
he
really
tried
did
without
food
and
talk
and
sleep
in
order
to
save
himself
up
for
it
a
man
ca
both
and
i
remember
he
said
to
me
once
he
so
much
force
no
more
and
he
can
either
make
himself
with
it
or
something
else
if
he
tries
to
do
both
he
does
both
imperfectly
i
going
to
do
perfect
thing
oh
he
was
a
queer
chap
fancy
a
fellow
making
a
thing
like
that
statue
out
of
himself
and
then
wanting
somebody
to
adore
him
and
i
had
the
faintest
conception
of
how
much
i
did
adore
him
till
yet
again
as
he
had
done
before
he
seemed
to
you
know
to
take
himself
away
from
me
again
leaving
me
all
alone
and
so
wretched
and
i
was
angry
at
the
same
time
for
he
promised
me
he
would
do
it
again
this
was
one
night
i
do
remember
when
i
ran
to
my
landing
and
shouted
down
into
the
yard
benlian
benlian
there
was
a
light
in
his
studio
and
i
heard
a
muffled
shout
come
back
keep
away
keep
away
keep
away
he
was
struggling
i
knew
he
was
struggling
as
i
stood
there
on
my
landing
struggling
to
let
me
go
and
i
could
only
run
and
throw
myself
on
my
bed
and
sob
while
he
tried
to
set
me
free
who
did
want
to
be
set
free
he
was
having
a
terrific
struggle
all
alone
there
he
told
me
afterwards
that
he
to
eat
something
now
and
then
and
to
sleep
a
little
and
that
weakened
him
strengthened
him
strengthened
his
body
and
weakened
the
passing
you
know
but
the
next
day
it
was
all
right
again
i
was
benlian
again
and
i
wondered
when
i
remembered
his
struggle
whether
a
dying
man
had
ever
fought
for
life
as
hard
as
benlian
was
fighting
to
get
away
from
it
and
pass
himself
the
next
time
after
that
that
he
fetched
me
called
me
whatever
you
like
to
name
it
i
burst
into
his
studio
like
a
bullet
he
was
sunk
in
a
big
chair
gaunt
as
a
mummy
now
and
all
the
life
in
him
seemed
to
burn
in
the
bottom
of
his
deep
at
the
sight
of
him
i
fiddled
with
my
knuckles
and
giggled
you
going
it
benlian
i
said
am
i
not
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
a
breath
you
me
to
bring
the
camera
and
magnesium
did
you
i
had
snatched
them
up
when
i
felt
his
call
and
had
brought
them
yes
go
ahead
so
i
placed
the
camera
before
him
made
all
ready
and
took
the
magnesium
ribbon
in
a
pair
of
pincers
are
you
ready
i
said
and
lighted
the
ribbon
the
studio
seemed
to
leap
with
the
blinding
glare
the
ribbon
spat
and
spluttered
i
snapped
the
shutter
and
the
fumes
drifted
away
and
hung
in
clouds
in
the
roof
you
have
to
walk
me
about
soon
pudgie
and
bang
me
with
bladders
as
they
do
the
he
said
sleepily
let
me
take
one
of
the
statue
now
i
said
eagerly
but
he
put
up
his
hand
no
no
too
much
like
testing
our
god
faith
the
food
they
feed
gods
on
pudgie
we
let
the
people
photograph
it
when
all
over
he
said
now
get
it
developed
i
developed
the
plate
the
obliteration
now
seemed
complete
but
benlian
seemed
dissatisfied
there
something
wrong
somewhere
he
said
it
is
so
perfect
as
that
yet
i
can
feel
within
me
it
is
it
merely
that
your
camera
is
strong
enough
to
find
me
pudgie
i
get
another
in
the
morning
i
cried
no
he
answered
i
know
something
better
than
that
have
a
cab
here
by
ten
in
the
morning
and
we
go
somewhere
by
ten
the
next
morning
we
had
driven
to
a
large
hospital
and
had
gone
down
a
lot
of
steps
and
along
corridors
to
a
basement
room
there
was
a
stretcher
couch
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
all
manner
of
queer
appliances
frames
of
ground
glass
tubes
of
glass
blown
into
extraordinary
shapes
a
dynamo
and
a
lot
of
other
things
all
about
a
couple
of
doctors
were
there
too
and
benlian
was
talking
to
them
we
try
my
hand
first
benlian
said
he
advanced
to
the
couch
and
put
his
hand
under
one
of
the
frames
of
ground
glass
one
of
the
doctors
did
something
in
a
corner
a
harsh
crackling
filled
the
room
and
an
unearthly
fluorescent
light
shot
and
flooded
across
the
frame
where
benlian
hand
was
the
two
doctors
looked
and
then
started
back
one
of
them
gave
a
cry
he
was
sickly
white
put
me
on
the
couch
said
benlian
i
and
the
doctor
who
was
not
ill
lifted
him
on
the
canvas
stretcher
the
frame
of
fluctuating
light
was
passed
over
the
whole
of
his
body
then
the
doctor
ran
to
a
telephone
and
called
a
colleague
we
spent
the
morning
there
with
dozens
of
doctors
coming
and
going
then
we
left
all
the
way
home
in
the
cab
benlian
chuckled
to
himself
that
scared
pudgie
he
chuckled
a
man
they
ca
that
scared
we
must
put
that
down
in
the
diary
was
it
ripping
i
chuckled
back
he
kept
a
sort
of
diary
or
record
he
gave
it
to
me
afterwards
but
they
borrowed
it
it
was
as
big
as
a
ledger
and
immensely
valuable
i
sure
they
ought
to
borrow
valuable
things
like
that
and
not
return
them
the
laughing
that
benlian
and
i
have
had
over
that
diary
it
fooled
them
all
the
clever
men
the
artists
of
the
academies
everybody
written
on
the
was
my
i
shall
publish
it
when
i
get
it
back
again
benlian
had
now
got
frightfully
weak
it
awfully
hard
work
passing
yourself
and
he
had
to
take
a
little
milk
now
and
then
or
he
have
died
before
he
had
quite
finished
i
did
bother
with
miniatures
any
longer
and
when
angry
letters
came
from
my
employers
we
just
put
them
into
the
fire
benlian
and
i
and
we
laughed
that
is
to
say
i
laughed
but
benlian
only
smiled
being
too
weak
to
laugh
really
he
lots
of
money
so
that
was
all
right
and
i
slept
in
his
studio
to
be
there
for
the
passing
and
that
would
be
very
long
now
i
thought
and
i
was
always
looking
at
the
statue
things
like
that
in
case
you
do
know
have
to
be
done
gradually
and
i
supposed
he
was
busy
filling
up
the
inside
of
it
and
had
got
to
the
outside
yet
for
the
statue
was
much
the
same
to
look
at
but
reckoning
off
his
sips
of
milk
and
snatches
of
sleep
he
was
making
splendid
progress
and
the
figure
must
be
getting
very
full
now
i
was
awfully
excited
it
was
getting
so
near
and
then
somebody
came
bothering
and
nearly
spoiling
all
it
odd
but
i
really
forget
exactly
what
it
was
i
only
know
there
was
a
funeral
and
people
were
sobbing
and
looking
at
me
and
somebody
said
i
was
callous
but
somebody
else
said
no
look
at
him
and
that
it
was
just
the
other
way
about
and
i
think
i
remember
now
that
it
was
in
london
for
i
was
in
a
train
but
after
the
funeral
i
dodged
them
and
found
myself
back
at
euston
again
they
followed
me
but
i
shook
them
off
i
locked
my
own
studio
up
and
lay
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
in
benlian
place
when
they
came
hammering
at
the
door
and
now
i
must
come
to
what
you
called
the
finish
though
it
awfully
stupid
to
call
things
like
that
finishes
i
slipped
into
my
own
studio
one
night
i
forget
what
for
and
i
gone
quietly
for
i
knew
they
were
following
me
those
people
and
would
catch
me
if
they
could
it
was
a
thick
misty
night
and
the
light
came
streaming
up
through
benlian
roof
window
with
the
shadows
of
the
losing
themselves
like
dark
rays
in
the
fog
a
lot
of
hooting
was
going
on
down
the
river
steamers
and
barges
oh
i
know
what
i
come
into
my
studio
for
it
was
for
those
negatives
benlian
wanted
them
for
the
diary
so
that
it
could
be
seen
there
was
any
fake
about
the
prints
for
he
said
he
would
make
a
final
spurt
that
evening
and
get
the
job
finished
it
had
taken
a
long
time
but
i
bet
could
have
passed
any
quicker
when
i
got
back
he
was
sitting
in
the
chair
he
hardly
left
for
weeks
and
the
diary
was
on
the
table
by
his
side
i
taken
all
the
scaffolding
down
from
the
statue
and
he
was
ready
to
begin
he
had
to
waste
one
last
bit
of
strength
to
explain
to
me
but
i
drew
as
close
as
i
could
so
that
he
would
lose
much
now
pudgie
i
just
heard
him
say
you
behaved
splendidly
and
you
be
quite
still
up
to
the
finish
wo
you
i
nodded
and
you
must
expect
the
statue
to
come
down
and
walk
about
or
anything
like
that
he
continued
are
the
really
wonderful
things
and
no
doubt
people
will
tell
you
it
has
changed
but
you
know
better
it
much
more
wonderful
that
i
should
be
there
than
that
they
should
be
able
to
prove
it
is
it
and
of
course
i
do
know
exactly
how
it
will
happen
for
i
never
done
this
before
you
have
the
letter
for
the
they
can
photograph
it
if
they
want
by
the
way
you
do
think
the
same
of
my
statue
as
you
did
at
first
do
you
oh
it
wonderful
i
breathed
and
even
if
like
the
god
of
the
others
it
does
vouchsafe
a
special
sign
and
wonder
it
benlian
for
all
that
oh
do
be
quick
benlian
i
ca
bear
another
minute
then
for
the
last
time
he
turned
his
great
eyes
on
me
seal
you
mine
he
said
then
his
eyes
fastened
themselves
on
the
statue
i
waited
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
scarcely
breathing
benlian
breath
came
in
little
flutters
many
seconds
apart
he
had
a
little
clock
on
the
table
twenty
minutes
passed
and
half
an
hour
i
was
a
little
disappointed
really
that
the
statue
was
going
to
move
but
benlian
knew
best
and
it
was
filling
quietly
up
with
him
instead
then
i
thought
of
those
zigzag
bunches
of
lightning
they
draw
on
the
advertisements
and
i
was
rather
glad
after
all
that
the
statue
going
to
move
it
would
have
been
a
little
cheap
that
vulgar
in
a
sense
he
was
breathing
a
little
more
sharply
now
as
if
in
pain
but
his
eyes
never
moved
a
dog
was
howling
somewhere
and
i
hoped
that
the
hooting
of
the
tugs
would
disturb
benlian
nearly
an
hour
had
passed
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
pushed
my
chair
farther
away
and
cowered
back
gnawing
my
fingers
very
frightened
benlian
had
suddenly
moved
he
set
himself
forward
in
his
chair
and
he
seemed
to
be
strangling
his
mouth
was
wide
open
and
he
began
to
make
long
harsh
i
should
have
thought
passing
yourself
was
such
agony
and
then
i
gave
a
scream
for
he
seemed
to
be
thrusting
himself
back
in
his
chair
again
as
if
he
changed
his
mind
and
did
want
to
pass
himself
at
all
but
just
you
ask
anybody
when
you
get
yourself
just
over
passed
the
other
dragged
out
of
you
and
you
ca
help
yourself
his
became
so
loud
and
horrid
that
i
shut
my
eyes
and
stopped
my
ears
minutes
that
lasted
and
then
there
came
a
high
dinning
that
i
could
shut
out
and
all
at
once
the
floor
shook
with
a
heavy
thump
when
all
was
still
again
i
opened
my
eyes
his
chair
had
overturned
and
he
lay
in
a
heap
beside
it
i
called
benlian
but
he
did
answer
he
passed
beautifully
quite
dead
i
looked
up
at
the
statue
it
was
just
as
benlian
had
said
it
did
open
its
eyes
nor
speak
nor
anything
like
that
do
you
believe
chaps
who
tell
you
that
statues
that
have
been
passed
into
do
that
they
do
but
instead
in
a
blaze
and
flash
and
shock
i
knew
now
for
the
first
time
what
a
glorious
thing
that
statue
was
have
you
ever
seen
anything
for
the
first
time
like
that
if
you
have
you
never
see
very
much
afterwards
you
know
the
rest
all
piffle
after
that
it
was
like
coming
out
of
fog
and
darkness
into
a
split
in
the
open
heavens
my
statue
was
so
transfigured
and
i
bet
if
you
been
there
you
have
clapped
your
hands
as
i
did
and
chucked
the
tablecloth
over
the
benlian
on
the
floor
till
they
should
come
to
cart
that
empty
shell
away
and
patted
the
statue
foot
and
cried
it
all
right
i
did
this
and
then
i
rushed
excitedly
out
into
the
street
to
call
somebody
to
see
how
glorious
it
was
they
brought
me
here
for
a
holiday
and
i
to
go
back
to
the
studio
in
two
or
three
days
but
they
said
that
before
and
i
think
caddish
of
fellows
not
to
keep
their
word
and
not
to
return
a
valuable
diary
too
but
there
is
a
peephole
in
my
room
as
there
is
in
some
of
them
the
emperor
of
brazil
told
me
that
and
benlian
knows
i
forsaken
him
for
they
take
me
a
message
every
day
to
the
studio
and
benlian
always
answers
that
it
and
i
to
stay
where
i
am
for
a
bit
so
as
long
as
he
knows
i
do
mind
so
much
but
it
is
a
bit
rotten
hanging
on
here
especially
when
the
doctors
themselves
admit
how
reasonable
it
all
is
still
if
benlian
says
it
io
as
the
young
man
put
his
hand
to
the
uppermost
of
the
four
brass
to
the
right
of
the
fanlighted
door
he
paused
withdrew
the
hand
again
and
then
pulled
at
the
lowest
knob
the
sawing
of
answered
him
and
he
waited
for
a
moment
uncertain
whether
the
bell
had
rung
before
pulling
again
then
there
came
from
the
basement
a
single
cracked
stroke
the
head
of
a
maid
appeared
in
the
whitewashed
area
below
and
the
head
was
withdrawn
as
apparently
the
maid
recognised
him
steps
were
heard
along
the
hall
the
door
was
opened
and
the
maid
stood
aside
to
let
him
enter
the
apron
with
which
she
had
slipped
the
latch
still
crumpled
in
her
greasy
hand
sorry
daisy
the
young
man
apologised
but
i
did
want
to
bring
her
down
all
those
stairs
how
is
she
has
she
been
out
the
maid
replied
that
the
person
spoken
of
had
been
out
and
the
young
man
walked
along
the
wide
carpeted
passage
it
was
cumbered
like
an
with
alabaster
busts
on
pedestals
dusty
palms
in
faience
vases
and
trophies
of
spears
and
shields
and
assegais
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
a
rustling
portière
of
strung
beads
and
beyond
it
the
carpet
was
continued
up
the
broad
easy
flight
secured
at
each
step
by
a
brass
rod
where
the
stairs
made
a
turn
the
fading
light
of
the
december
afternoon
made
still
dimmer
by
a
window
of
decalcomanied
glass
shone
on
a
cloudy
green
aquarium
with
sallow
goldfish
a
number
of
cacti
on
a
shabby
console
table
and
a
large
and
dirty
white
sheepskin
rug
passing
along
a
short
landing
the
young
man
began
the
ascent
of
the
second
flight
this
also
was
carpeted
but
with
a
carpet
that
had
done
duty
in
some
or
before
being
cut
up
into
strips
of
the
width
of
the
narrow
space
between
the
wall
and
the
handrail
then
as
he
still
mounted
the
young
man
feet
sounded
loud
on
oilcloth
and
when
he
finally
paused
and
knocked
at
a
door
it
was
on
a
small
landing
of
naked
boards
beneath
the
cold
gleam
of
the
skylight
above
the
well
of
the
stairs
come
in
a
girl
voice
called
the
room
he
entered
had
a
low
sagging
ceiling
on
which
shone
a
low
glow
of
firelight
making
colder
still
the
patch
of
eastern
sky
beyond
the
roofs
and
the
cowls
and
hoods
of
chimneys
framed
by
the
square
of
the
single
window
the
glow
on
the
ceiling
was
reflected
dully
in
the
old
dark
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
an
open
door
in
the
farther
corner
hampered
with
skirts
and
blouses
allowed
a
glimpse
of
the
bedroom
the
young
man
set
the
paper
bag
he
carried
down
on
the
littered
round
table
and
advanced
to
the
girl
who
sat
in
an
old
wicker
chair
before
the
fire
the
girl
did
not
turn
her
head
as
he
kissed
her
cheek
and
he
looked
down
at
something
that
had
muffled
the
sound
of
his
steps
as
he
had
approached
her
hallo
that
new
is
it
bessie
where
did
that
come
from
he
asked
cheerfully
the
middle
of
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
common
jute
matting
but
on
the
hearth
was
a
magnificent
rug
hepburn
sent
it
up
there
was
a
draught
from
under
the
door
much
warmer
for
my
feet
very
kind
of
hepburn
well
how
are
you
feeling
old
girl
better
thanks
ed
that
the
style
you
be
yourself
again
soon
daisy
says
you
been
out
yes
i
went
for
a
walk
but
not
far
i
went
to
the
museum
and
then
sat
down
you
early
are
you
he
turned
away
to
get
a
chair
from
which
he
had
to
move
a
mass
of
patterns
and
buckram
linings
he
brought
it
to
the
rug
yes
i
stopped
last
night
late
to
cash
up
for
vedder
so
he
staying
turn
and
turn
about
well
tell
us
all
about
it
bess
their
faces
were
red
in
the
firelight
hers
had
the
prettiness
that
the
first
glance
almost
exhausts
the
prettiness
amazing
in
its
quantity
that
one
sees
for
a
moment
under
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
when
shops
and
offices
close
for
the
day
she
was
and
and
only
the
rather
remarkable
smallness
of
the
head
on
the
splendid
thick
throat
saved
her
from
ordinariness
he
too
might
have
been
seen
in
his
thousands
at
the
close
of
any
day
hurrying
home
to
catford
or
walham
green
or
tufnell
park
to
tea
and
an
evening
with
a
girl
or
in
a
or
else
dining
cheaply
up
west
preparatory
to
smoking
cigarettes
from
yellow
packets
in
the
upper
circle
of
a
four
inches
of
white
collar
encased
his
neck
and
as
he
lifted
his
trousers
at
the
knee
to
clear
his
purple
socks
the
pair
of
paper
covers
showed
that
had
protected
his
cuffs
during
the
day
at
the
office
he
removed
them
crumpled
them
up
and
threw
them
on
the
fire
and
the
momentary
addition
to
the
light
of
the
upper
chamber
showed
how
was
that
superb
neck
of
hers
and
how
moody
and
tired
her
eyes
from
his
face
only
one
would
have
guessed
and
guessed
wrongly
that
his
preferences
were
for
and
his
conversation
showed
them
to
be
otherwise
it
was
of
polytechnic
classes
that
he
spoke
and
of
the
course
of
lectures
in
english
literature
that
had
just
begun
and
as
if
somebody
had
asserted
that
the
pursuit
of
such
studies
was
not
compatible
with
a
certain
measure
of
physical
development
also
he
announced
that
he
was
not
sure
that
he
should
not
devote
say
half
an
evening
a
week
on
wednesdays
to
training
in
the
gymnasium
sana
in
corpore
bessie
he
said
a
sound
mind
in
a
sound
body
you
know
that
tremendously
important
especially
when
a
fellow
spends
the
day
in
a
stuffy
office
yes
i
think
i
shall
give
it
half
wednesdays
from
to
sends
you
home
in
a
glow
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
the
literature
class
the
second
lecture
the
first
was
splendid
all
about
the
languages
of
europe
and
asia
what
they
call
the
languages
you
know
aryans
i
ca
tell
you
exactly
without
my
notes
but
the
hindoos
and
persians
i
think
it
was
they
crossed
the
himalaya
mountains
and
spread
westward
somehow
as
far
as
europe
that
was
the
way
it
all
began
it
was
splendid
the
way
the
lecturer
put
it
english
is
a
germanic
language
you
know
then
came
the
celts
i
wish
i
brought
my
notes
i
see
you
been
reading
let
look
a
book
lay
on
her
knees
its
back
warped
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
he
took
it
and
opened
it
ah
keats
glad
you
like
keats
bessie
we
need
be
great
readers
but
it
important
that
what
we
do
read
should
be
all
right
i
do
know
him
not
know
him
that
is
but
he
quite
all
right
in
fact
and
he
an
example
of
what
i
always
maintained
that
knowledge
should
be
brought
within
the
reach
of
all
it
just
shows
he
was
the
son
of
a
keeper
you
know
so
what
he
have
been
if
really
had
chances
been
to
universities
and
so
on
there
no
knowing
but
of
course
it
more
from
the
historical
standpoint
that
studying
these
things
let
have
a
look
he
opened
the
book
where
a
hairpin
between
the
leaves
marked
a
place
the
firelight
glowed
on
the
page
and
he
read
monotonously
and
inelastically
as
i
sat
over
the
light
blue
hills
there
came
a
noise
of
revellers
the
rills
into
the
wide
stream
came
of
purple
hue
was
bacchus
and
his
crew
the
earnest
trumpet
spake
and
silver
thrills
from
kissing
cymbals
made
a
merry
din
was
bacchus
and
his
kin
like
to
a
moving
vintage
down
they
came
crowned
with
green
leaves
and
faces
all
on
flame
all
madly
dancing
through
the
pleasant
valley
to
scare
thee
melancholy
it
was
the
wondrous
passage
from
of
the
descent
of
the
wild
inspired
rabble
into
india
ed
plucked
for
a
moment
at
his
lower
lip
and
then
with
a
hm
what
it
all
about
bessie
continued
within
his
car
aloft
young
bacchus
stood
trifling
his
in
dancing
mood
with
sidelong
laughing
and
little
rills
of
crimson
wine
imbrued
his
plump
white
arms
and
shoulders
enough
white
for
venus
pearly
bite
and
near
him
rode
silenus
on
his
ass
pelted
with
flowers
as
he
on
did
pass
tipsily
quaffing
hm
i
see
mythology
that
made
up
of
tales
and
myths
you
know
like
odin
and
thor
and
those
only
those
were
scandinavian
mythology
so
it
would
be
absurd
to
take
it
too
seriously
but
i
think
in
a
way
things
like
that
do
harm
you
see
he
explained
the
more
beautiful
they
are
the
more
harm
they
might
do
we
ought
always
to
show
virtue
and
vice
in
their
true
colours
and
if
you
look
at
it
from
that
point
of
view
this
is
just
drunkenness
that
rotten
destroys
your
body
and
intellect
as
i
heard
a
chap
say
once
it
an
insult
to
the
beasts
to
call
it
beastly
i
joined
the
blue
ribbon
when
i
was
fourteen
and
i
have
been
sorry
for
it
yet
no
now
there
vedder
he
off
on
a
bend
as
he
calls
it
last
night
and
even
he
says
this
morning
it
was
worth
it
but
read
on
again
he
read
with
unresilient
movement
saw
osirian
egypt
kneel
adown
before
the
vine
wreath
crown
i
saw
parched
abyssinia
rouse
and
sing
to
the
silver
cymbals
ring
i
saw
the
whelming
vintage
hotly
pierce
old
tartary
the
fierce
great
brahma
from
his
mystic
heaven
hm
he
was
a
buddhist
god
brahma
was
mythology
again
as
i
say
if
you
take
it
seriously
it
just
glorifying
but
i
say
i
can
hardly
see
better
light
the
lamp
we
have
tea
first
then
read
no
you
sit
still
i
get
it
ready
i
know
where
things
are
he
rose
crossed
to
a
little
cupboard
with
a
sink
in
it
filled
the
kettle
at
the
tap
and
brought
it
to
the
fire
then
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
lamp
the
cheap
glass
shade
was
of
a
foolish
corolla
shape
clear
glass
below
shading
to
pink
and
deepening
to
red
at
the
crimped
edge
it
gave
a
false
warmth
to
the
spaces
of
the
room
above
the
level
of
the
mantelpiece
and
ed
figure
as
he
turned
the
regulator
looked
from
the
waist
upwards
as
if
he
stood
within
that
portion
of
a
spectrum
screen
that
deepens
to
the
band
of
red
the
bright
concentric
circles
that
spread
in
rings
of
red
on
the
ceiling
were
more
dimly
reduplicated
in
the
old
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
and
the
wintry
eastern
light
beyond
the
seemed
suddenly
almost
to
die
out
bessie
her
white
neck
below
the
level
of
the
had
taken
up
the
book
again
but
she
was
not
reading
she
was
looking
over
it
at
the
upper
part
of
the
grate
presently
she
spoke
i
was
looking
at
some
of
those
things
this
afternoon
at
the
museum
he
was
clearing
from
the
table
more
buckram
linings
and
patterns
of
paper
numbers
of
myra
journal
and
the
delineator
already
on
his
way
to
the
cupboard
he
had
put
aside
a
dressmaker
shape
of
wood
and
wire
what
things
he
asked
those
you
were
reading
about
greek
are
they
oh
the
greek
room
but
those
people
bacchus
and
those
people
in
the
ordinary
sense
gods
and
goddesses
most
of
bacchus
was
a
god
that
what
mythology
means
i
wish
sometimes
our
course
took
in
greek
literature
but
it
a
dead
language
after
all
german
more
good
in
modern
life
it
would
be
nice
to
know
everything
but
one
has
to
select
you
know
hallo
i
clean
forgot
i
brought
you
some
grapes
bessie
here
they
are
in
this
bag
we
have
after
tea
what
but
she
said
again
after
a
pause
still
looking
at
the
grate
they
had
their
priests
and
priestesses
and
followers
and
people
had
they
it
was
their
things
i
was
looking
at
combs
and
brooches
and
hairpins
and
things
to
cut
their
nails
with
they
all
in
a
glass
case
there
and
they
had
exactly
like
ours
oh
they
were
a
civilised
people
said
ed
cheerfully
it
all
gives
you
an
idea
i
only
hope
you
did
tire
yourself
out
you
soon
be
all
right
of
course
but
you
have
to
be
careful
yet
we
have
a
clean
tablecloth
shall
we
she
had
been
seriously
ill
her
life
had
been
despaired
of
and
somehow
the
young
polytechnic
student
seemed
anxious
to
assure
her
that
she
was
now
all
right
again
or
soon
would
be
they
were
to
be
married
as
soon
as
things
brightened
up
a
bit
and
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
he
watched
her
head
and
neck
as
he
continued
to
lay
the
table
and
then
as
he
crossed
once
more
to
the
cupboard
he
put
his
hand
lightly
in
passing
on
her
hair
she
gave
so
quick
a
start
that
he
too
started
she
must
have
been
very
deep
in
her
reverie
to
have
been
so
taken
by
surprise
i
say
bessie
do
jump
like
that
he
cried
with
involuntary
quickness
indeed
had
his
hand
been
or
or
taloned
she
could
not
have
turned
a
more
startled
even
frightened
face
to
him
it
was
your
touching
me
she
muttered
resuming
her
gazing
into
the
grate
he
stood
looking
anxiously
down
on
her
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
discuss
her
state
and
he
knew
it
but
in
his
anxiety
he
forgot
it
that
jumpiness
is
the
effect
of
your
illness
you
know
i
shall
be
glad
when
it
all
over
it
made
you
so
odd
she
was
not
pleased
that
he
should
speak
of
her
oddness
for
that
matter
she
too
found
him
odd
at
any
rate
found
it
difficult
to
realise
that
he
was
as
he
always
had
been
he
had
begun
to
irritate
her
a
little
his
reading
of
the
verses
had
irritated
her
and
she
had
tried
hard
to
hide
from
him
that
his
cocksure
opinions
and
the
tone
in
which
they
were
pronounced
jarred
on
her
it
was
not
that
she
was
better
than
he
knew
any
more
than
he
did
did
she
supposed
love
him
still
the
same
these
moods
that
dated
from
her
illness
had
nothing
to
do
with
those
things
she
reproached
herself
sometimes
that
she
was
subject
to
such
doldrums
it
all
right
ed
but
please
do
touch
me
just
now
she
said
he
was
in
the
act
of
leaning
over
her
chair
but
he
saw
her
shrink
and
refrained
poor
old
girl
he
said
sympathetically
what
the
matter
i
do
know
it
awfully
stupid
of
me
to
be
like
this
but
i
help
it
i
shall
be
better
soon
if
you
leave
me
alone
nothing
happened
has
it
only
those
silly
dreams
i
told
you
about
bother
the
dreams
muttered
the
polytechnic
student
during
her
illness
she
had
had
dreams
and
had
come
to
herself
at
intervals
to
find
ed
or
the
doctor
hepburn
or
her
aunt
bending
over
her
these
kind
solicitous
faces
had
been
no
more
than
a
glimpse
and
then
she
had
gone
off
into
the
dreams
again
the
curious
thing
had
been
that
the
dreams
had
seemed
to
be
her
vivid
waking
life
and
the
other
things
the
anxious
faces
the
details
of
her
dingy
bedroom
the
thermometer
under
her
tongue
had
been
the
dream
and
though
she
had
come
back
to
actuality
the
dreams
had
never
quite
vanished
she
could
remember
no
more
of
them
than
that
they
had
seemed
to
hold
a
high
singing
and
jocundity
issuing
from
some
region
of
haze
and
golden
light
and
they
seemed
to
hover
ever
on
the
point
of
being
recaptured
yet
ever
eluding
all
her
mental
efforts
she
was
living
now
between
reality
and
a
vision
she
had
fewer
words
than
sensations
and
it
was
a
little
pitiful
to
hear
her
vainly
striving
to
make
clear
what
she
meant
it
so
queer
she
said
it
like
being
on
the
edge
of
something
a
sort
of
tiptoe
i
ca
describe
it
sometimes
i
could
almost
touch
it
with
my
hand
and
then
it
goes
away
but
never
quite
away
it
like
something
just
past
the
corner
of
my
eye
over
my
shoulder
and
i
sit
very
still
sometimes
trying
to
take
it
off
its
guard
but
the
moment
i
move
my
head
it
moves
too
like
this
again
he
gave
a
quick
start
at
the
suddenness
of
her
action
very
stealthily
her
faunish
eyes
had
stolen
sideways
and
then
she
had
swiftly
turned
her
head
here
i
say
do
bessie
he
cried
nervously
you
look
awfully
uncanny
when
you
do
that
you
brooding
he
continued
that
what
you
doing
brooding
you
getting
into
a
low
state
you
want
bucking
up
i
do
think
i
shall
go
to
the
polytec
i
shall
stay
and
cheer
you
up
you
know
i
really
do
think
you
making
an
effort
darling
his
last
words
seemed
to
strike
her
they
seemed
to
fit
in
with
something
of
which
she
too
was
conscious
not
making
an
effort
she
wondered
how
he
knew
that
she
felt
in
some
vague
way
that
it
was
important
that
she
should
make
an
effort
for
while
her
dream
ever
evaded
her
and
yet
never
ceased
to
call
her
with
such
a
voice
as
he
who
reads
on
a
magic
page
of
the
calling
of
elves
hears
stilly
in
his
brain
yet
somehow
behind
the
seduction
was
another
and
a
sterner
voice
there
was
warning
as
well
as
fascination
beyond
that
edge
at
which
she
strained
on
tiptoe
mingled
with
the
jocund
calls
to
hasten
hasten
were
deeper
calls
that
bade
her
beware
they
puzzled
her
beware
of
what
of
what
danger
and
to
whom
how
do
you
mean
i
not
making
an
effort
ed
she
asked
slowly
again
looking
into
the
fire
where
the
kettle
now
made
a
singing
why
an
effort
to
get
all
right
again
to
be
as
you
used
to
be
as
of
course
you
will
be
soon
as
i
used
to
be
the
words
came
with
a
little
check
in
her
breathing
yes
before
all
this
to
be
yourself
you
know
myself
all
jolly
and
without
these
jerks
and
jumps
i
wish
you
could
get
away
a
fortnight
by
the
sea
would
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
she
knew
not
what
it
was
in
the
words
the
sea
that
caused
her
suddenly
to
breathe
more
deeply
the
sea
it
was
as
if
by
the
mere
uttering
of
them
he
had
touched
some
secret
spring
brought
to
fulfilment
some
spell
what
had
he
meant
by
speaking
of
the
sea
a
fortnight
before
had
somebody
spoken
to
her
of
the
sea
it
would
have
been
the
sea
of
margate
of
brighton
of
southend
that
supplying
the
image
that
a
word
calls
up
as
if
by
conjuration
she
would
have
seen
before
her
and
what
other
image
could
she
supply
could
she
possibly
supply
now
yet
she
did
or
almost
did
supply
one
what
new
experience
had
she
had
or
what
old
old
one
had
been
released
in
her
with
that
confused
joyous
dinning
just
beyond
the
range
of
physical
hearing
there
had
suddenly
mingled
a
new
illusion
of
sound
a
vague
vast
pash
and
rustle
silky
and
harsh
both
at
once
its
tireless
voice
holding
meanings
of
stillness
and
solitude
compared
with
which
the
silence
that
is
mere
absence
of
sound
was
vacancy
it
was
part
of
her
dream
invisible
intangible
inaudible
yet
there
as
if
he
had
been
an
enchanter
it
had
come
into
being
at
the
word
upon
his
lips
had
he
other
such
words
had
he
the
master
word
that
ah
she
knew
what
the
master
word
would
do
would
make
the
vision
the
reality
and
the
reality
the
vision
deep
within
her
she
felt
something
her
soul
herself
she
knew
not
what
thrill
and
turn
over
and
settle
again
the
sea
she
repeated
in
a
low
voice
yes
that
what
you
want
to
set
you
up
rather
do
you
remember
that
fortnight
at
littlehampton
you
and
me
and
your
aunt
jolly
that
was
i
like
littlehampton
it
is
flash
like
brighton
and
margate
always
so
beastly
crowded
and
do
you
remember
that
afternoon
by
the
windmill
i
did
love
you
that
afternoon
bessie
he
continued
to
talk
but
she
was
not
listening
she
was
wondering
why
the
words
the
sea
were
somehow
part
of
it
all
the
pins
and
brooches
of
the
museum
the
book
on
her
knees
the
dream
she
remembered
a
game
of
she
had
played
as
a
child
in
which
cries
of
warm
warm
warmer
had
announced
the
approach
to
the
hidden
object
oh
she
was
getting
warm
positively
hot
he
had
ceased
to
talk
and
was
watching
her
perhaps
it
was
the
thought
of
how
he
had
loved
her
that
afternoon
by
the
windmill
that
had
brought
him
close
to
her
chair
again
she
was
aware
of
his
nearness
and
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
as
if
she
dreaded
something
then
she
said
quickly
is
tea
nearly
ready
ed
and
as
he
turned
to
the
table
took
up
the
book
again
she
felt
that
even
to
touch
that
book
brought
her
warmer
it
fell
open
at
a
page
she
did
not
hear
the
clatter
ed
made
at
the
table
nor
yet
the
babble
his
words
had
evoked
of
the
pierrots
and
banjos
and
minstrels
of
margate
and
littlehampton
it
was
to
hear
a
gladder
wilder
tumult
that
she
sat
once
more
so
still
so
achingly
listening
the
earnest
trumpet
spake
and
silver
thrills
from
kissing
cymbals
made
a
merry
din
the
words
seemed
to
move
on
the
page
in
her
eyes
another
light
than
the
firelight
seemed
to
play
her
breast
rose
and
in
her
thick
white
throat
a
little
inarticulate
sound
twanged
eh
did
you
speak
bessie
ed
asked
stopping
in
his
buttering
of
bread
eh
no
in
answering
her
head
had
turned
for
a
moment
and
she
had
seen
him
suddenly
it
struck
her
with
force
what
a
shaving
of
a
man
he
was
conscious
of
his
little
important
lip
and
chin
yes
he
needed
a
polytechnic
gymnastic
course
then
she
remarked
how
once
at
margate
she
had
seen
him
in
the
distance
as
in
a
hired
baggy
he
had
bathed
from
a
machine
in
muddy
water
one
of
a
hundred
others
all
rather
cold
flinging
a
about
and
shouting
stridently
a
sound
mind
in
a
sound
body
he
was
rather
vain
of
his
neat
shoes
too
and
doubtless
stunted
his
feet
and
she
had
seen
the
little
spot
on
his
neck
caused
by
the
chafing
of
his
no
she
did
not
want
him
to
touch
her
just
now
at
any
rate
his
touch
would
be
too
like
a
betrayal
of
another
touch
somewhere
sometime
somehow
in
that
tantalising
dream
that
refused
to
allow
itself
either
to
be
fully
remembered
or
quite
forgotten
what
was
that
dream
what
was
it
she
continued
to
gaze
into
the
fire
of
a
sudden
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
choked
cry
of
almost
animal
fury
the
fool
had
touched
her
carried
away
doubtless
by
the
memory
of
that
afternoon
by
the
windmill
he
had
in
passing
once
more
to
the
kettle
crept
softly
behind
her
and
put
a
swift
burning
kiss
on
the
side
of
her
neck
then
he
had
retreated
before
her
stumbling
against
the
table
and
causing
the
cups
and
saucers
to
jingle
the
tilted
up
but
righted
itself
again
i
told
you
i
told
you
she
choked
her
stockish
figure
shaking
with
rage
i
told
you
you
he
put
up
his
elbow
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
touch
me
you
the
words
broke
from
her
he
had
put
himself
farther
round
the
table
he
stammered
here
dash
it
all
bessie
what
is
the
matter
touch
me
all
right
he
said
sullenly
i
wo
touch
you
again
no
fear
i
did
know
you
were
such
a
firebrand
all
right
drop
it
now
i
again
good
lord
slowly
the
white
fist
she
had
drawn
back
sank
to
her
side
again
all
right
now
he
continued
to
grumble
resentfully
you
need
take
on
so
it
said
i
wo
touch
you
again
then
as
if
he
remembered
that
after
all
she
was
ill
and
must
be
humoured
he
began
while
her
bosom
still
rose
and
fell
rapidly
to
talk
with
an
assumption
that
nothing
much
had
happened
come
sit
down
again
bessie
the
tea
in
the
pot
and
i
have
it
ready
in
a
couple
of
jiffs
what
a
ridiculous
little
girl
you
are
to
take
on
like
that
and
i
say
listen
that
a
and
there
a
grand
fire
for
toast
you
sit
down
while
i
run
out
and
get
give
me
your
key
so
i
can
let
myself
in
again
he
took
her
key
from
her
bag
caught
up
his
hat
and
hastened
out
but
she
did
not
sit
down
again
she
was
no
calmer
for
his
quick
disappearance
in
that
moment
when
he
had
recoiled
from
her
she
had
had
the
expression
of
some
handsome
and
angered
snake
its
hood
puffed
ready
to
strike
she
stood
dazed
one
would
have
supposed
that
that
kiss
of
his
had
indeed
been
the
master
word
she
sought
the
word
she
felt
approaching
the
word
to
which
the
objects
of
the
museum
the
book
that
rustle
of
a
sea
she
had
never
seen
had
been
but
the
ever
warming
stages
some
merest
trifle
stood
between
her
and
those
elfin
cries
between
her
and
that
thin
golden
mist
in
which
faintly
seen
shapes
seemed
to
move
shapes
almost
of
tossed
arms
waving
brandishing
objects
strangely
all
but
familiar
that
roaring
of
the
sea
was
not
the
rushing
of
her
own
blood
in
her
ears
that
rosy
flush
not
the
artificial
glow
of
the
cheap
red
lampshade
the
shapes
were
almost
as
plain
as
if
she
saw
them
in
some
clear
but
black
mirror
the
sounds
almost
as
audible
as
if
she
heard
them
through
some
not
very
thick
muffling
quick
the
book
she
muttered
but
even
as
she
stretched
out
her
hand
for
it
again
came
that
solemn
sound
of
warning
as
if
something
sought
to
stay
it
she
had
deliberately
to
thrust
her
hand
forward
again
the
high
dinning
calls
of
hasten
hasten
were
mingled
with
that
deeper
beware
she
knew
in
her
soul
that
once
over
that
terrible
edge
the
dream
would
become
the
reality
and
the
reality
the
dream
she
knew
nothing
of
the
fluidity
of
the
thing
called
personality
not
a
thing
at
all
but
a
state
a
balance
a
relation
a
resultant
of
forces
so
delicately
in
equilibrium
that
a
touch
and
pff
the
horror
of
formlessness
rushed
over
all
as
she
hesitated
a
new
light
appeared
in
the
chamber
within
the
frame
of
the
small
square
window
beyond
the
ragged
line
of
the
an
edge
of
orange
brightness
showed
she
leaned
forward
it
was
the
full
moon
rusty
and
bloated
and
flattened
by
the
the
next
moment
her
hand
had
clutched
at
the
book
whence
came
ye
merry
damsels
whence
came
ye
so
many
and
so
many
and
such
glee
why
have
ye
left
your
bowers
desolate
your
lutes
and
gentler
fate
follow
bacchus
bacchus
on
the
wing
bacchus
young
bacchus
good
or
ill
betide
we
dance
before
him
thorough
kingdoms
wide
come
hither
lady
fair
and
joined
be
to
our
wild
minstrelsy
there
was
an
instant
in
which
darkness
seemed
to
blot
out
all
else
then
it
rolled
aside
and
in
a
blaze
of
brightness
was
gone
it
was
gone
and
she
stood
face
to
face
with
her
dream
that
for
two
thousand
years
had
slumbered
in
the
blood
of
her
and
her
line
she
stood
with
mouth
agape
and
eyes
that
hailed
her
thick
throat
full
of
suppressed
clamour
the
other
was
the
dream
now
and
these
they
came
down
mad
and
noisy
and
bright
maenades
thyades
satyrs
fauns
naked
in
hides
of
beasts
ungirded
dishevelled
wreathed
and
garlanded
dancing
singing
shouting
the
thudding
of
their
hooves
shook
the
ground
and
the
clash
of
their
timbrels
and
the
rustling
of
their
thyrsi
filled
the
air
they
brandished
frontal
bones
the
dismembered
quarters
of
kids
and
goats
they
struck
the
bronze
cantharus
they
tossed
the
silver
obba
up
aloft
down
a
cleft
of
rocks
and
woods
they
came
trooping
to
a
wide
seashore
with
the
red
of
the
sunset
behind
them
she
saw
the
evening
light
on
the
sleek
and
dappled
hides
the
gilded
ivory
and
rich
brown
of
their
legs
and
shoulders
the
white
of
inner
arms
held
up
on
high
their
wide
red
mouths
the
quivering
of
the
twin
on
the
necks
of
the
leaping
fauns
and
shutting
out
the
glimpse
of
sky
at
the
head
of
the
deep
ravine
the
god
himself
descended
with
his
car
full
of
drunken
girls
who
slept
with
the
serpents
coiled
about
them
shouting
and
moaning
and
frenzied
leaping
upon
one
another
with
libidinous
laughter
and
beating
one
another
with
the
thyrsi
they
poured
down
to
the
yellow
sands
and
the
anemonied
pools
of
the
shore
they
raced
to
the
water
that
gleamed
pale
as
nacre
in
the
deepening
twilight
in
the
eye
of
the
evening
star
they
ran
along
its
edge
over
their
images
in
the
wet
sands
calling
their
lost
companion
hasten
hasten
they
cried
and
one
of
them
a
young
man
with
a
torso
noble
as
the
dawn
and
strong
as
those
of
the
eternal
hills
ran
here
and
there
calling
her
name
louder
louder
she
called
back
in
an
ecstasy
something
dropped
and
tinkled
against
the
fender
it
was
one
of
her
hairpins
one
side
of
her
hair
was
in
a
loose
tumble
she
threw
up
the
small
head
on
the
superb
thick
neck
louder
i
can
not
hear
once
more
the
throwing
up
of
her
head
that
had
brought
down
the
rest
of
her
hair
had
given
her
a
glimpse
of
herself
in
the
glass
over
the
mantelpiece
for
the
last
time
that
formidable
beware
sounded
like
thunder
in
her
ears
the
next
moment
she
had
snapped
with
her
fingers
the
ribbon
that
was
cutting
into
her
throbbing
throat
he
with
the
torso
and
those
shoulders
was
seeking
her
how
should
he
know
her
in
that
dreary
garret
in
those
joyless
habiliments
he
would
as
soon
known
his
own
in
that
dummy
by
the
window
yonder
her
fingers
clutched
at
the
tawdry
mercerised
silk
of
her
blouse
there
was
a
rip
and
her
arms
and
throat
were
free
she
panted
as
she
tugged
at
something
that
gave
with
a
short
as
of
steel
fastenings
something
fell
against
the
fender
these
also
she
tore
at
them
and
kicked
them
as
they
lay
about
her
feet
as
leaves
lie
about
the
trunk
of
a
tree
in
autumn
ah
and
as
she
stood
there
as
if
within
the
screen
of
a
spectrum
that
deepened
to
the
band
of
red
her
eyes
fell
on
the
at
her
feet
she
caught
it
up
and
in
doing
so
saw
purple
grapes
purple
grapes
that
issued
from
the
mouth
of
a
paper
bag
on
the
table
with
the
dappled
pelt
about
her
she
sprang
forward
the
juice
spurted
through
them
into
the
mass
of
her
loosened
hair
down
her
body
there
was
a
spilth
of
seeds
and
pulp
she
cried
hoarsely
aloud
once
more
oh
answer
me
tell
me
my
name
ed
steps
were
heard
on
the
oilclothed
portion
of
the
staircase
my
name
oh
my
name
she
cried
in
an
agony
of
suspense
oh
they
will
not
wait
for
me
they
have
lighted
the
torches
they
run
up
and
down
the
shore
with
torches
oh
can
not
you
see
me
suddenly
she
dashed
to
the
chair
on
which
the
litter
of
linings
and
lay
she
caught
up
a
double
handful
and
crammed
them
on
the
fire
they
caught
and
flared
there
was
a
call
upon
the
stairs
and
the
sound
of
somebody
mounting
in
haste
once
once
only
my
name
the
soul
of
the
bacchante
rioted
struggled
to
escape
from
her
eyes
then
as
the
door
was
flung
open
she
heard
and
gave
a
terrifying
shout
of
recognition
i
hear
i
almost
hear
but
once
more
io
io
io
ed
in
the
doorway
stood
for
one
moment
agape
the
next
ignorant
of
the
full
purport
of
his
own
words
ignorant
that
though
man
may
come
westwards
he
may
yet
bring
his
worship
with
him
ignorant
that
to
make
the
dream
the
reality
and
the
reality
the
dream
is
heaven
dreadfullest
favour
and
ignorant
that
that
edge
once
crossed
there
is
no
return
to
the
sanity
and
sweetness
and
light
that
are
only
seen
clearly
in
the
moment
when
they
are
lost
for
ever
he
had
dashed
down
the
stairs
crying
in
a
voice
hoarse
and
high
with
terror
she
mad
she
mad
the
accident
i
the
street
had
not
changed
so
much
but
that
little
by
little
its
influence
had
come
over
romarin
again
and
as
the
clock
a
street
or
two
away
had
struck
seven
he
had
stood
his
hands
folded
on
his
stick
first
curious
then
expectant
and
finally
as
the
sound
had
died
away
oddly
satisfied
in
his
memory
the
clock
had
a
peculiar
chime
a
rather
elaborate
one
ending
inconclusively
on
the
dominant
and
followed
after
an
unusually
long
interval
by
the
stroke
of
the
hour
itself
not
until
its
last
vibration
had
become
too
subtle
for
his
ear
had
romarin
resumed
the
occupation
that
the
pealing
of
the
hour
had
interrupted
it
was
an
occupation
that
especially
tended
to
abstraction
of
mind
the
noting
in
detail
of
the
little
things
of
the
street
that
he
had
forgotten
with
such
completeness
that
they
awakened
only
tardy
responses
in
his
memory
now
that
his
eyes
rested
on
them
again
the
shape
of
a
doorknocker
the
grouping
of
an
old
the
crack
still
there
in
a
flagstone
somewhere
deep
in
the
past
these
things
had
associations
but
they
lay
very
deep
and
the
disturbing
of
them
gave
romarin
a
curious
desolate
feeling
as
of
returning
to
things
he
had
long
but
as
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
objects
the
sluggish
memories
roused
more
and
more
and
for
each
bit
of
the
old
that
reasserted
itself
scores
of
yards
of
the
new
seemed
to
disappear
new
went
a
wall
brought
up
flush
where
formerly
a
recess
had
been
became
the
recess
once
more
the
intermittent
electric
sign
at
the
street
end
that
wrote
in
green
and
crimson
the
name
of
a
whiskey
across
a
façade
ceased
to
worry
his
eyes
and
the
unfamiliar
new
front
of
the
little
restaurant
he
was
passing
and
repassing
took
on
its
old
and
aspect
again
seven
he
had
thought
in
dismissing
his
hansom
that
it
had
been
later
his
appointment
was
not
until
a
quarter
past
but
he
decided
against
entering
the
restaurant
and
waiting
inside
seeing
who
his
guest
was
it
would
be
better
to
wait
at
the
door
by
the
light
of
the
restaurant
window
he
corrected
his
watch
and
then
sauntered
a
few
yards
along
the
street
to
where
men
were
moving
flats
of
scenery
from
a
back
door
of
the
new
theatre
into
a
sort
of
tumbril
the
theatre
was
twenty
years
old
but
to
romarin
it
was
the
new
theatre
there
had
been
no
theatre
there
in
his
day
in
his
day
his
day
had
been
twice
twenty
years
before
forty
years
before
that
street
that
quarter
had
been
bound
up
in
his
life
he
had
not
forty
years
ago
been
the
famous
painter
honoured
decorated
taken
by
the
arm
by
monarchs
he
had
been
a
student
wild
and
raw
as
any
with
that
tranquil
and
urbane
philosophy
that
had
made
his
success
still
in
abeyance
within
him
as
his
eyes
had
rested
on
the
doorknocker
next
to
the
restaurant
a
smile
had
crossed
his
face
how
had
come
to
be
left
by
the
old
crowd
that
had
wrenched
off
so
many
others
by
what
accident
had
survived
to
bring
back
all
the
old
life
now
so
oddly
he
stood
again
smiling
his
hands
folded
on
his
stick
a
crown
prince
had
given
him
that
stick
and
had
had
it
engraved
to
my
friend
romarin
you
ought
to
be
here
you
know
he
said
to
the
if
i
did
get
you
marsden
ought
to
have
done
so
it
was
marsden
whom
romarin
had
come
to
meet
marsden
of
whom
he
had
thought
with
such
odd
persistency
lately
marsden
was
the
only
man
in
the
world
between
whom
and
himself
lay
as
much
as
the
shadow
of
an
enmity
and
even
that
faint
shadow
was
now
passing
one
does
not
guard
for
forty
years
animosities
that
take
their
rise
in
quick
outbreaks
of
the
young
blood
and
now
that
romarin
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
really
hated
marsden
for
more
than
a
few
months
it
had
been
within
those
very
doors
romarin
was
passing
the
restaurant
again
that
there
had
been
that
quick
blow
about
a
girl
and
the
tables
had
been
pushed
hastily
back
and
he
and
marsden
had
fought
while
the
other
fellows
had
kept
the
waiters
away
and
romarin
was
now
and
marsden
must
be
a
year
older
and
the
girl
who
knew
probably
dead
long
ago
yes
time
heals
these
things
thank
god
and
romarin
had
felt
a
genuine
flush
of
pleasure
when
marsden
had
accepted
his
invitation
to
dinner
but
romarin
looked
at
his
watch
again
it
was
rather
like
marsden
to
be
late
marsden
had
always
been
like
that
had
come
and
gone
pretty
much
as
he
had
pleased
regardless
of
inconvenience
to
others
but
doubtless
he
had
had
to
walk
if
all
reports
were
true
marsden
had
not
made
very
much
of
his
life
in
the
way
of
worldly
success
and
romarin
sorry
to
hear
it
had
wished
he
could
give
him
a
even
a
good
man
can
not
do
much
when
the
current
of
his
life
sets
against
him
in
a
tide
of
persistent
and
romarin
honoured
and
successful
yet
knew
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
lucky
ones
but
it
was
just
like
marsden
to
be
late
for
all
that
at
first
romarin
did
not
recognise
him
when
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
and
walked
towards
him
he
had
made
up
his
mind
beforehand
exactly
how
he
had
expected
marsden
to
look
but
he
was
conscious
that
he
did
look
it
it
was
not
the
short
stubble
of
grey
beard
so
short
that
it
seemed
to
hesitate
between
beard
and
unshavenness
it
was
not
the
figure
nor
carriage
clothes
alter
that
and
the
clothes
of
the
man
who
was
advancing
to
meet
romarin
were
to
put
it
bluntly
shabby
nor
was
it
but
romarin
did
not
know
what
it
was
in
the
advancing
figure
that
for
the
moment
found
no
response
in
his
memory
he
was
already
within
half
a
dozen
yards
of
the
men
who
were
moving
the
scenery
from
the
theatre
into
the
tumbril
and
one
of
the
workmen
put
up
his
hand
as
the
edge
of
a
fresh
wing
appeared
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
same
thing
happened
that
had
happened
when
the
clock
had
struck
seven
romarin
found
himself
suddenly
expectant
attentive
and
then
again
curiously
satisfied
in
his
memory
marsden
voice
at
least
had
not
changed
it
was
as
in
the
old
days
a
little
envious
sarcastic
accepting
lower
interpretations
somewhat
willingly
somewhat
grudging
of
better
ones
it
completed
the
taking
back
of
romarin
that
the
chiming
of
the
clock
the
doorknocker
the
grouping
of
the
and
the
crack
in
the
flagstone
had
begun
well
my
distinguished
academician
my
marsden
voice
sounded
across
the
group
of
a
mo
you
please
said
another
voice
for
a
moment
the
painted
wing
shut
them
off
from
one
another
in
that
moment
romarin
accident
befell
him
if
its
essential
nature
is
related
in
arbitrary
terms
it
is
that
there
are
no
other
terms
to
relate
it
in
it
is
a
decoded
cipher
which
can
be
restored
to
its
cryptic
form
as
romarin
subsequently
restored
it
as
the
painter
took
marsden
arm
and
entered
the
restaurant
he
noticed
that
while
the
outside
of
the
place
still
retained
traces
of
the
old
its
inside
was
entirely
new
its
cheap
glittering
that
gave
a
false
impression
of
the
actual
size
of
the
place
its
loves
and
shepherdesses
painted
in
the
style
of
the
carts
of
the
vendors
of
its
and
its
propeller
that
set
the
air
slowly
in
motion
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
might
all
have
been
matched
in
a
dozen
similar
establishments
within
hail
of
a
its
announced
that
one
might
dine
there
la
or
for
two
shillings
neither
the
cooking
nor
the
service
had
influenced
romarin
in
his
choice
of
a
place
to
dine
at
he
made
a
gesture
to
the
waiter
who
advanced
to
help
him
on
with
his
coat
that
marsden
was
to
be
assisted
first
but
marsden
with
a
grunted
all
right
had
already
helped
himself
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
coat
told
romarin
why
marsden
kept
waiters
at
a
little
twinge
of
compunction
took
him
that
his
own
overcoat
should
be
and
lined
with
silk
they
sat
down
at
a
corner
table
not
far
from
the
slowly
moving
propeller
now
we
can
talk
romarin
said
i
glad
glad
to
see
you
again
marsden
it
was
a
peculiarly
vicious
face
that
he
saw
corrugated
about
the
brows
and
with
stiff
hair
untrimmed
about
the
ears
it
shocked
romarin
a
little
he
had
hardly
looked
to
see
certain
things
so
accentuated
by
the
passage
of
time
romarin
own
brow
was
high
and
bald
and
benign
and
his
beard
was
like
a
broad
shield
of
silver
you
glad
are
you
said
marsden
as
they
sat
down
facing
one
another
well
i
glad
to
be
seen
with
you
it
revive
my
credit
a
bit
there
a
fellow
across
there
has
recognised
you
already
by
your
photographs
in
the
papers
i
assume
i
may
he
made
a
little
upward
movement
of
his
hand
it
was
a
gin
and
bitters
marsden
assumed
he
might
have
romarin
ordered
it
he
himself
did
not
take
one
marsden
tossed
down
the
at
one
gulp
then
he
reached
for
his
roll
pulled
it
to
pieces
and
romarin
remembered
how
in
the
old
days
marsden
had
always
eaten
bread
like
that
began
to
throw
bullets
of
bread
into
his
mouth
formerly
this
habit
had
irritated
romarin
intensely
now
well
well
life
uses
some
of
us
better
than
others
small
blame
to
these
if
they
throw
up
the
struggle
marsden
poor
devil
but
the
arrival
of
the
soup
interrupted
romarin
meditation
he
consulted
the
card
ordered
the
succeeding
courses
and
the
two
men
ate
for
some
minutes
in
silence
well
said
romarin
presently
pushing
away
his
plate
and
wiping
his
white
moustache
are
you
still
a
romanticist
marsden
marsden
who
had
tucked
his
napkin
between
two
of
the
buttons
of
his
frayed
waistcoat
looked
suspiciously
across
the
glass
with
the
dregs
of
the
gin
and
bitters
that
he
had
half
raised
to
his
lips
eh
he
said
i
say
romarin
do
let
go
among
memories
merely
for
the
sake
of
making
conversation
yours
may
be
pleasant
but
i
not
in
the
habit
of
wasting
much
time
over
mine
might
as
well
be
making
new
ones
i
drink
whiskey
and
soda
it
was
brought
a
large
one
and
marsden
nodding
took
a
deep
gulp
health
he
said
thanks
said
romarin
instantly
noting
that
the
monosyllable
which
matched
the
other
in
curtness
was
not
at
all
the
reply
he
had
intended
thank
you
yours
he
amended
and
a
short
pause
followed
in
which
fish
was
brought
this
was
not
what
romarin
had
hoped
for
he
had
desired
to
be
reconciled
with
marsden
not
merely
to
be
allowed
to
pay
for
his
dinner
yet
if
marsden
did
not
wish
to
talk
it
was
difficult
not
to
defer
to
his
wish
it
was
true
that
he
had
asked
if
marsden
was
still
a
romanticist
largely
for
the
sake
of
something
to
say
but
marsden
prompt
pointing
out
of
this
was
not
encouraging
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
never
known
precisely
what
marsden
had
meant
by
the
word
romance
he
had
so
frequently
taken
into
his
mouth
he
only
knew
that
this
creed
of
romanticism
whatever
it
was
had
been
worn
rather
challengingly
a
chip
on
the
shoulder
to
be
knocked
off
at
some
peril
or
other
and
it
had
seemed
to
romarin
a
little
futile
in
the
violence
with
which
it
had
been
maintained
but
that
was
neither
here
nor
there
the
point
was
that
the
conversation
had
begun
not
very
happily
and
must
be
mended
at
once
if
at
all
to
mend
it
romarin
leaned
across
the
table
be
as
friendly
as
i
am
marsden
he
said
i
think
pardon
me
that
if
our
positions
were
reversed
and
i
saw
in
you
the
sincere
desire
to
help
that
i
have
i
take
it
in
the
right
way
again
marsden
looked
suspiciously
at
him
to
help
how
to
help
he
demanded
that
what
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
but
i
suppose
for
example
you
still
work
oh
my
work
marsden
made
a
little
gesture
of
contempt
try
again
romarin
you
do
do
any
come
i
no
bad
friend
to
my
friends
and
find
me
especially
so
but
marsden
put
up
his
hand
not
quite
so
quickly
he
said
let
see
what
you
mean
by
help
first
do
you
really
mean
that
you
want
me
to
borrow
money
from
you
that
help
as
i
understand
it
nowadays
then
you
changed
said
romarin
wondering
however
in
his
secret
heart
whether
marsden
had
changed
very
much
in
that
respect
after
all
marsden
gave
a
short
honk
of
a
laugh
you
did
suppose
i
had
changed
did
you
then
he
leaned
suddenly
forward
this
is
rather
a
mistake
romarin
rather
a
mistake
he
said
what
is
this
our
meeting
again
quite
a
mistake
romarin
sighed
i
had
hoped
not
he
said
marsden
leaned
forward
again
with
another
gesture
romarin
remembered
very
well
dinner
knife
in
hand
edge
and
palm
upwards
punctuating
and
expounding
with
the
point
i
tell
you
it
a
mistake
he
said
knife
and
hand
balanced
you
ca
reopen
things
like
this
you
do
really
to
reopen
them
you
only
want
to
reopen
certain
of
them
you
want
to
pick
and
choose
among
things
to
approve
and
disapprove
there
must
have
been
somewhere
or
other
something
in
me
you
did
altogether
dislike
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
think
what
it
was
by
the
way
and
you
want
to
lay
stress
on
that
and
to
sink
the
rest
well
you
ca
i
wo
let
you
i
not
submit
my
life
to
you
like
that
if
you
want
to
go
into
things
all
right
but
it
must
be
all
or
none
and
i
like
another
drink
he
put
the
knife
down
with
a
little
clap
as
romarin
beckoned
to
the
waiter
there
was
distress
on
romarin
face
he
was
not
conscious
of
having
adopted
a
superior
attitude
but
again
he
told
himself
that
he
must
make
allowances
men
who
do
come
off
in
life
struggle
are
apt
to
be
touchy
and
he
was
after
all
the
same
old
marsden
the
man
with
whom
he
desired
to
be
at
peace
are
you
quite
fair
to
me
he
asked
presently
in
a
low
voice
again
the
knife
was
taken
up
and
its
point
advanced
yes
i
am
said
marsden
in
a
slightly
raised
voice
and
he
indicated
with
the
knife
the
mirror
at
the
end
of
the
table
you
know
you
done
well
and
i
to
all
appearances
have
you
ca
look
at
that
glass
and
not
know
it
but
i
followed
the
line
of
my
development
too
no
less
logically
than
you
my
life
been
mine
and
i
not
going
to
apologise
for
it
to
a
single
breathing
creature
more
i
proud
of
it
at
least
there
been
singleness
of
intention
about
it
so
i
think
strictly
fair
in
pointing
that
out
when
you
talk
about
helping
me
perhaps
so
perhaps
so
romarin
agreed
a
little
sadly
it
your
tone
more
than
anything
else
that
makes
things
a
little
difficult
believe
me
i
no
end
in
my
mind
except
pure
friendliness
said
marsden
a
long
no
that
seemed
to
deliberate
to
examine
and
finally
to
admit
no
i
believe
that
and
you
usually
get
what
you
set
out
for
oh
yes
i
watched
your
rise
i
made
a
point
of
watching
it
it
been
a
bit
at
a
time
but
you
got
there
that
sort
it
on
your
forehead
your
destiny
romarin
smiled
hallo
that
new
is
it
he
said
it
was
your
habit
to
talk
much
about
destiny
if
i
remember
rightly
let
me
see
was
this
more
your
style
passion
and
says
et
cetera
and
so
forth
was
that
it
with
always
the
suspicion
not
far
away
that
you
did
things
more
from
theoretical
conviction
than
real
impulse
after
all
a
dispassionate
observer
would
have
judged
that
the
words
went
somewhere
near
home
marsden
was
scraping
together
with
the
edge
of
his
knife
the
crumbs
of
his
broken
roll
he
scraped
them
into
a
little
square
and
then
trimmed
the
corners
not
until
the
little
pile
was
shaped
to
his
liking
did
he
look
surlily
up
let
it
rest
romarin
he
said
curtly
drop
it
he
added
let
it
alone
if
i
begin
to
talk
like
that
too
we
shall
only
cut
one
another
up
clink
glasses
there
and
let
it
alone
mechanically
romarin
clinked
but
his
bald
brow
was
perplexed
one
another
up
he
repeated
yes
let
it
alone
one
another
up
he
repeated
once
more
you
puzzle
me
entirely
well
perhaps
i
altogether
wrong
i
only
wanted
to
warn
you
that
dared
a
good
many
things
in
my
time
now
drop
it
romarin
had
fine
brown
eyes
under
oriental
arched
brows
again
they
noted
the
singularly
vicious
look
of
the
man
opposite
they
were
full
of
mistrust
and
curiosity
and
he
stroked
his
silver
beard
drop
it
he
said
slowly
no
let
go
on
i
want
to
hear
more
of
this
i
much
rather
have
another
drink
in
peace
and
quietness
waiter
either
leaned
back
in
his
chair
surveying
the
other
you
a
perverse
devil
still
was
romarin
thought
marsden
apparently
was
of
nothing
but
the
whiskey
and
soda
the
waiter
had
gone
to
fetch
romarin
was
inclined
to
look
askance
at
a
man
who
could
follow
up
a
gin
and
bitters
with
three
or
four
whiskeys
and
soda
without
turning
a
hair
it
argued
the
seasoned
cask
marsden
had
bidden
the
waiter
leave
the
bottle
and
the
syphon
on
the
table
and
was
already
mixing
himself
another
stiff
peg
well
he
said
since
you
will
have
it
so
to
the
old
days
to
the
old
days
said
romarin
watching
him
gulp
it
down
queer
looking
back
across
all
that
time
at
is
it
how
do
you
feel
about
it
in
a
mixed
kind
of
way
i
think
the
usual
thing
pleasure
and
regret
mingled
oh
you
have
regrets
have
you
for
certain
things
yes
not
let
me
say
my
with
you
marsden
he
laughed
that
why
i
chose
the
old
place
he
gave
a
glance
round
at
its
glittering
newness
do
you
happen
to
remember
what
all
that
was
about
i
only
the
vaguest
idea
marsden
gave
him
a
long
look
that
all
he
asked
oh
i
remember
in
a
sort
of
way
that
of
yours
was
really
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
suspect
tell
me
he
smiled
did
you
really
suppose
life
could
be
lived
on
those
mad
lines
you
used
to
lay
down
my
life
said
marsden
calmly
has
been
not
literally
literally
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
outgrown
i
hope
not
romarin
had
thrown
up
his
handsome
head
well
well
he
murmured
incredulously
why
well
marsden
demanded
but
of
course
you
never
did
and
never
will
know
what
i
meant
by
romance
no
i
ca
say
that
i
did
but
as
i
conceived
it
it
was
something
that
began
in
appetite
and
ended
in
diabetes
not
philosophic
eh
marsden
inquired
picking
up
a
chicken
bone
highly
unphilosophic
said
romarin
shaking
his
head
hm
grunted
marsden
stripping
the
bone
well
i
grant
it
pays
in
a
different
way
it
does
pay
then
romarin
asked
oh
yes
it
pays
the
restaurant
had
filled
up
it
was
one
frequented
by
young
artists
musicians
journalists
and
the
clingers
to
the
rather
frayed
fringes
of
the
arts
from
time
to
time
heads
were
turned
to
look
at
romarin
portly
and
handsome
figure
which
the
press
the
regent
street
photographic
establishments
and
the
academy
supplements
had
made
well
known
the
plump
young
frenchwoman
within
the
glazed
cash
office
near
the
door
at
whom
marsden
had
several
times
glanced
in
a
way
at
which
romarin
had
frowned
was
aware
of
the
honour
done
the
restaurant
and
several
times
the
proprietor
had
advanced
and
inquired
with
concern
whether
the
dinner
and
the
service
was
to
the
liking
of
and
the
eyes
that
were
turned
to
romarin
plainly
wondered
who
the
scallawag
dining
with
him
might
be
since
romarin
had
chosen
that
their
conversation
should
be
of
the
old
days
and
without
picking
and
choosing
marsden
was
quite
willing
that
it
should
be
so
again
he
was
casting
the
bullets
of
bread
into
his
mouth
and
again
romarin
was
conscious
of
irritation
marsden
too
noticed
it
but
in
awaiting
the
he
still
continued
to
roll
and
bolt
the
pellets
washing
them
down
with
gulps
of
whiskey
and
soda
oh
yes
it
paid
he
resumed
not
in
that
way
of
course
he
indicated
the
head
quickly
turned
away
again
of
an
aureoled
youngster
with
a
large
bunch
of
black
satin
tie
not
in
admiration
of
that
sort
but
in
other
ways
tell
me
about
it
certainly
if
you
want
it
but
you
my
host
wo
you
let
me
hear
your
side
of
it
all
first
but
i
thought
you
said
you
knew
that
had
followed
my
career
so
i
have
it
not
your
list
of
honours
and
degrees
let
me
see
what
are
you
doctor
of
literature
whatever
that
means
and
professor
of
this
that
and
the
other
and
not
at
the
end
of
it
yet
i
know
all
that
i
do
say
you
have
earned
it
i
admire
your
painting
but
it
not
that
i
want
to
know
what
it
like
to
be
up
there
where
you
are
it
was
a
childish
question
and
romarin
felt
foolish
in
trying
to
answer
it
such
things
were
the
things
the
adoring
aureoled
youngster
a
table
or
two
away
would
have
liked
to
ask
romarin
recognised
in
marsden
the
old
craving
for
sensation
it
was
part
of
the
theoretical
creed
marsden
had
made
for
himself
of
doing
things
not
for
their
own
sakes
but
in
order
that
he
might
have
done
them
of
course
it
had
appeared
to
a
fellow
like
that
that
romarin
himself
had
always
had
a
calculated
end
in
view
he
had
not
marsden
merely
measured
romarin
peck
out
of
his
own
bushel
it
had
been
marsden
who
in
seeking
his
own
life
had
lost
it
and
romarin
was
more
than
a
little
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
vehemence
with
which
he
protested
that
he
had
not
lost
it
was
precisely
the
measure
of
the
loss
but
he
essayed
it
essayed
to
give
marsden
a
of
his
career
he
told
him
of
the
stroke
of
sheer
luck
that
had
been
the
foundation
of
it
all
the
falling
ill
of
another
painter
who
had
turned
over
certain
commissions
to
him
he
told
him
of
his
poor
but
happy
marriage
and
of
the
windfall
not
large
but
timely
that
had
come
to
his
wife
he
told
him
of
fortunate
acquaintanceships
happily
cultivated
of
his
first
important
commission
of
the
fresco
that
had
procured
for
him
his
associateship
of
his
sale
to
the
chantrey
and
of
his
quietly
remunerative
visitorships
and
his
work
on
boards
and
committees
and
as
he
talked
marsden
drew
his
empty
glass
to
him
moistened
his
finger
with
a
little
spilt
liquid
and
began
to
run
the
finger
round
the
rim
of
the
glass
they
had
done
that
formerly
a
whole
roomful
of
them
producing
when
each
had
found
the
note
of
his
instrument
a
high
thin
intolerable
singing
to
this
singing
romarin
strove
to
tell
his
tale
but
that
thin
and
note
silenced
him
he
ended
lamely
with
some
empty
generalisation
on
success
ah
but
success
in
what
marsden
demanded
interrupting
his
playing
on
the
glass
for
a
moment
in
your
aim
whatever
it
may
be
ah
said
marsden
resuming
his
performance
romarin
had
sought
in
his
recital
to
minimise
differences
in
circumstances
but
marsden
seemed
bent
on
aggravating
them
he
had
the
miserable
advantage
of
the
man
who
has
nothing
to
lose
and
bit
by
bit
romarin
had
begun
to
realise
that
he
was
going
considerably
more
than
halfway
to
meet
this
old
enemy
of
his
and
that
amity
seemed
as
far
on
as
ever
in
his
heart
he
began
to
feel
the
foreknowledge
that
their
meeting
could
have
no
conclusion
he
hated
the
man
the
look
of
his
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
much
as
ever
the
proprietor
approached
with
profoundest
apology
in
his
attitude
would
pardon
him
but
the
noise
of
the
glass
it
was
annoying
another
had
made
complaint
eh
cried
marsden
oh
that
certainly
it
can
be
put
to
a
much
better
purpose
he
refilled
the
glass
the
liquor
had
begun
to
tell
on
him
a
quarter
of
the
quantity
would
have
made
a
man
incapably
drunk
but
it
had
only
made
eyes
bright
he
gave
a
sarcastic
laugh
and
is
that
all
he
asked
romarin
replied
shortly
that
that
was
all
you
missed
out
the
and
the
then
let
me
add
that
i
a
doctor
of
civil
law
and
a
full
member
of
the
royal
academy
said
romarin
almost
at
the
end
of
his
patience
and
now
since
you
do
think
much
of
it
may
i
hear
your
own
account
oh
by
all
means
i
do
know
however
that
he
broke
off
to
throw
a
glance
at
a
woman
who
had
just
entered
the
restaurant
a
divesting
glance
that
caused
romarin
to
redden
to
his
crown
and
drop
his
eyes
i
was
going
to
say
that
you
may
think
as
little
of
my
history
as
i
do
of
yours
supple
woman
that
when
the
rather
scraggy
blonde
does
take
it
into
her
head
to
be
a
devil
she
the
worst
kind
there
is
without
apology
romarin
looked
at
his
watch
all
right
said
marsden
smiling
for
what
got
out
of
life
then
but
i
warn
you
it
entirely
discreditable
romarin
did
not
doubt
it
but
it
mine
and
i
boast
of
it
i
done
barring
receiving
honours
and
degrees
everything
everything
if
there
anything
i
have
done
tell
me
and
lend
me
a
sovereign
and
i
go
and
do
it
you
have
told
the
story
that
so
here
goes
then
well
you
know
unless
you
forgotten
how
i
began
fruit
and
nutshells
and
nutcrackers
lay
on
the
table
between
them
and
at
the
end
of
it
shielded
from
draughts
by
the
menu
cards
the
coffee
apparatus
simmered
over
its
elusive
blue
flame
romarin
was
taking
the
rind
from
a
pear
with
a
and
marsden
had
declined
port
in
favour
of
a
small
golden
liqueur
of
brandy
every
seat
in
the
restaurant
was
now
occupied
and
the
proprietor
himself
had
brought
his
finest
cigarettes
and
cigars
the
waiter
poured
out
the
coffee
and
departed
with
the
apparatus
in
one
hand
and
his
napkin
in
the
other
marsden
was
already
well
into
his
tale
the
frightful
unction
with
which
he
told
it
appalled
romarin
it
was
as
he
had
said
there
was
nothing
he
had
not
done
and
did
not
exult
in
with
a
sickening
exultation
it
had
indeed
ended
in
diabetes
in
the
pitiful
hunting
down
of
sensation
to
the
last
inch
he
had
been
fiendishly
ingenious
and
utterly
unimaginative
his
unholy
curiosity
had
spared
nothing
his
unnatural
appetite
had
known
no
truth
it
was
grinning
sin
the
details
of
it
simply
can
not
be
told
and
his
vanity
in
it
all
was
prodigious
romarin
was
pale
as
he
listened
what
in
order
that
malignant
growth
in
society
breast
should
be
able
to
say
i
know
had
sanctities
been
profaned
sweet
conventions
assailed
purity
blackened
soundness
infected
and
all
that
was
bright
and
of
the
day
been
sunk
in
the
quagmire
that
this
creature
of
the
night
had
called
yes
stilled
called
by
the
gentle
name
of
romance
yes
so
it
had
been
not
only
had
men
and
women
suffered
dishonour
but
manhood
and
womanhood
and
the
clean
institutions
by
which
alone
the
creature
was
suffered
to
exist
had
been
brought
to
shame
and
what
was
he
to
look
at
when
it
was
all
done
romance
beauty
the
beauty
of
things
as
they
are
he
croaked
if
faces
in
the
restaurant
were
now
turned
to
romarin
it
was
the
horror
on
romarin
own
face
that
drew
them
he
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
brow
but
he
stammered
presently
you
are
speaking
of
generalities
horrible
theories
things
diabolically
conceivable
to
be
done
what
cried
marsden
checked
for
a
moment
in
his
horrible
triumph
no
by
god
i
done
done
do
you
understand
if
you
do
question
me
no
no
cried
romarin
but
i
say
yes
you
came
for
this
and
you
shall
have
it
i
tried
to
stop
you
but
you
wanted
it
and
by
god
you
shall
have
it
you
think
your
life
been
full
and
mine
empty
ha
ha
romance
i
had
the
conviction
of
it
and
i
had
the
courage
too
i
have
told
you
a
tenth
of
it
what
would
you
like
when
love
was
hot
the
killing
of
a
man
who
stood
in
my
way
i
fought
a
duel
and
killed
the
squeezing
of
the
juice
out
of
life
like
he
pointed
to
romarin
plate
romarin
had
been
eating
grapes
did
you
find
me
saying
i
do
a
thing
and
then
drawing
back
from
it
when
we
he
made
a
quick
gesture
of
both
hands
towards
the
middle
of
the
restaurant
floor
when
we
fought
yes
when
we
fought
here
oh
no
oh
no
i
lived
i
tell
you
every
moment
not
a
title
not
a
degree
but
i
lived
such
a
life
as
you
never
dreamed
of
thank
god
but
suddenly
marsden
voice
which
had
risen
dropped
again
he
began
to
shake
with
interior
chuckles
they
were
the
old
old
chuckles
and
they
filled
romarin
with
a
hatred
hardly
to
be
borne
the
sound
of
the
animal
voice
had
begun
it
and
his
every
word
look
movement
gesture
since
they
had
entered
the
restaurant
had
added
to
it
and
he
was
now
chuckling
chuckling
shaking
with
chuckles
as
if
some
monstrous
still
remained
to
be
told
already
romarin
had
tossed
aside
his
napkin
beckoned
to
the
waiter
and
said
dines
with
me
ho
ho
ho
ho
came
the
drunken
sounds
it
a
long
time
since
dined
here
with
his
old
friend
romarin
do
you
remember
the
last
time
do
you
remember
it
two
smacks
across
the
table
romarin
oh
you
got
it
in
very
well
and
then
quick
back
with
the
tables
all
the
fellows
round
farquharson
for
me
and
smith
for
you
and
then
to
it
romarin
and
you
really
do
remember
what
it
was
all
about
romarin
had
remembered
his
face
was
not
the
face
of
the
philosophic
master
of
life
now
you
said
she
should
little
pattie
hines
you
know
you
said
she
should
romarin
sprang
half
from
his
chair
and
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
and
by
heaven
she
did
at
least
that
one
thing
you
have
done
marsden
too
had
risen
unsteadily
oho
oho
you
think
that
a
wild
thought
flashed
across
romarin
brain
you
mean
i
mean
oho
oho
yes
i
mean
she
did
romarin
the
mirrors
mistily
seen
through
the
smoke
of
half
a
hundred
cigars
and
cigarettes
the
loves
and
shepherdesses
of
the
garish
walls
the
diners
starting
up
in
their
places
all
suddenly
seemed
to
swing
round
in
a
great
before
romarin
eyes
the
next
moment
feeling
as
if
he
stood
on
something
on
which
he
found
it
difficult
to
keep
his
balance
he
had
caught
up
the
with
which
he
had
peeled
the
pear
and
had
struck
at
the
side
of
marsden
neck
the
rounded
blade
snapped
but
he
struck
again
with
the
broken
edge
and
left
the
knife
where
it
entered
the
table
appeared
uptilted
almost
vertical
over
it
head
disappeared
it
was
followed
by
a
shower
of
glass
cigars
artificial
flowers
and
the
tablecloth
at
which
he
clutched
and
the
dirty
american
cloth
of
the
table
top
was
left
bare
but
the
edge
behind
which
marsden
face
had
disappeared
remained
vertical
a
group
of
were
moving
a
flat
of
scenery
from
a
theatre
into
a
cart
and
romarin
knew
that
past
present
and
future
he
had
seen
it
all
in
an
instant
and
that
marsden
stood
behind
that
painted
wing
and
he
knew
too
that
he
had
only
to
wait
until
that
flat
passed
and
to
take
marsden
arm
and
enter
the
restaurant
it
would
be
a
drowning
man
is
said
to
see
all
in
one
unmeasurable
instant
of
time
a
dream
is
but
they
say
an
instantaneous
arrangement
in
the
moment
of
waking
of
the
molecules
we
associate
with
ideas
and
the
past
of
history
and
the
future
of
prophecy
are
folded
up
in
the
mystic
moment
we
call
the
present
would
come
for
one
moment
romarin
stood
the
next
he
had
turned
and
run
for
his
life
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
collided
with
a
loafer
and
only
the
wall
saved
them
from
going
down
feverishly
romarin
plunged
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
handful
of
silver
he
crammed
it
into
the
loafer
hand
here
quick
take
it
he
gasped
there
a
man
there
by
that
restaurant
door
he
waiting
for
romarin
tell
him
tell
him
tell
him
romarin
had
an
accident
and
he
dashed
away
leaving
the
man
looking
at
the
silver
in
his
palm
the
cigarette
case
a
cigarette
loder
i
said
offering
my
case
for
the
moment
loder
was
not
smoking
for
long
enough
he
had
not
been
talking
thanks
he
replied
taking
not
only
the
cigarette
but
the
case
also
the
others
went
on
talking
loder
became
silent
again
but
i
noticed
that
he
kept
my
cigarette
case
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
from
time
to
time
with
an
interest
that
neither
its
design
nor
its
costliness
seemed
to
explain
presently
i
caught
his
eye
a
pretty
case
he
remarked
putting
it
down
on
the
table
i
once
had
one
exactly
like
it
i
answered
that
they
were
in
every
shop
window
oh
yes
he
said
putting
aside
any
question
of
rarity
i
lost
mine
oh
he
laughed
oh
that
all
right
i
got
it
back
again
do
be
afraid
i
going
to
claim
yours
but
the
way
i
lost
it
found
it
the
whole
thing
was
rather
curious
i
never
been
able
to
explain
it
i
wonder
if
you
could
i
answered
that
i
certainly
could
till
i
heard
it
whereupon
loder
taking
up
the
silver
case
again
and
holding
it
in
his
hand
as
he
talked
began
this
happened
in
provence
when
i
was
about
as
old
as
marsham
there
and
every
bit
as
romantic
i
was
there
with
carroll
you
remember
poor
old
carroll
and
what
a
blade
of
a
boy
he
was
as
romantic
as
four
marshams
rolled
into
one
excuse
me
marsham
wo
you
it
a
romantic
tale
you
see
or
at
least
the
setting
is
we
were
in
provence
carroll
and
i
or
thereabouts
romantic
as
i
say
and
and
this
happened
and
it
happened
on
the
top
of
a
whole
lot
of
other
things
you
must
understand
the
things
that
do
happen
when
you
if
it
had
been
provence
it
would
have
been
somewhere
else
i
suppose
nearly
if
not
quite
as
good
but
this
was
provence
that
smells
as
you
might
say
of
as
it
smells
of
argelasse
and
wild
lavender
and
broom
we
had
the
dickens
of
a
walk
of
it
just
with
knapsacks
had
started
somewhere
in
the
ardèche
and
tramped
south
through
the
vines
and
almonds
and
olives
montélimar
orange
avignon
and
a
fortnight
at
that
blanched
skeleton
of
a
town
les
baux
we
nothing
to
do
and
had
gone
just
where
we
liked
or
rather
just
where
carroll
had
liked
and
carroll
had
had
the
bello
in
his
pocket
and
had
had
a
notion
i
fancy
of
taking
in
the
whole
ground
of
the
roman
conquest
i
remember
he
lugged
me
off
to
some
place
or
other
pourrières
i
believe
its
name
was
because
i
forget
how
many
thousands
were
killed
in
a
there
and
they
stove
in
the
so
that
if
the
men
wanted
water
they
have
to
go
forward
and
fight
for
it
and
then
we
gone
on
to
arles
where
carroll
had
fallen
in
love
with
everything
that
had
a
bow
of
black
velvet
in
her
hair
and
after
that
tarascon
nîmes
and
so
on
the
usual
round
i
wo
bother
you
with
that
in
a
word
we
had
two
months
of
it
eating
almonds
and
apricots
from
the
trees
watching
the
women
at
the
communal
under
the
dark
singing
and
the
and
carroll
yarning
away
all
the
time
about
caesar
and
vercingetorix
and
dante
and
trying
to
learn
provençal
so
that
he
could
read
the
stuff
in
the
des
that
he
never
have
looked
at
if
it
had
been
in
english
well
we
got
to
darbisson
we
run
across
some
young
chap
or
other
rangon
his
name
was
who
was
a
in
those
parts
and
rangon
had
asked
us
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
with
him
with
him
and
his
mother
if
we
happened
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
so
as
we
might
as
well
happen
to
be
there
as
anywhere
else
we
sent
him
a
postcard
and
went
this
would
be
in
june
or
early
in
july
all
day
we
walked
across
a
plain
of
vines
past
hurdles
of
wattled
and
great
of
velvety
cypresses
sixty
feet
high
all
white
with
dust
on
the
north
side
of
for
the
mistral
was
having
its
revel
and
it
whistled
and
roared
through
the
till
scores
of
yards
of
at
a
time
were
bowed
nearly
to
the
earth
a
roaring
day
it
was
i
remember
but
the
wind
fell
a
little
late
in
the
afternoon
and
we
were
poring
over
what
it
had
left
of
our
ordnance
survey
like
fools
we
got
the
unmounted
paper
maps
instead
of
the
linen
ones
when
rangon
himself
found
us
coming
out
to
meet
us
in
a
very
badly
trap
he
drove
us
back
himself
through
darbisson
to
the
house
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
it
where
he
lived
with
his
mother
he
spoke
no
english
rangon
did
though
of
course
both
french
and
provençal
and
as
he
drove
us
there
was
carroll
using
him
as
a
dictionary
peppering
him
with
questions
about
the
names
of
things
in
the
patois
i
beg
its
pardon
the
language
though
a
good
deal
of
my
eye
and
betty
martin
about
that
and
i
fancy
this
félibrige
business
will
be
in
a
good
many
pieces
when
frédéric
mistral
is
under
that
pavilion
arrangement
he
had
put
up
for
himself
in
the
graveyard
at
maillanne
if
the
language
has
got
to
go
well
it
got
to
go
i
suppose
and
while
i
personally
do
want
to
give
it
a
kick
i
rather
sympathise
with
the
government
those
jaunts
of
a
sunday
out
to
les
baux
for
instance
with
paper
lanterns
and
bengal
fire
and
a
fellow
spouting
blanche
venus
they
well
enough
and
compare
favourably
with
our
bank
holidays
and
sunday
league
picnics
but
but
that
nothing
to
do
with
my
tale
after
all
so
he
drove
on
and
by
the
time
we
got
to
rangon
house
carroll
had
learned
the
greater
part
of
as
you
no
doubt
know
it
a
restricted
sort
of
life
in
some
respects
that
a
young
lives
in
those
parts
and
it
was
as
we
reached
the
house
that
rangon
remembered
something
or
he
might
have
been
trying
to
tell
us
as
we
came
along
for
all
i
know
and
not
been
able
to
get
a
word
in
edgeways
for
carroll
and
his
provençal
it
seemed
that
his
mother
was
away
from
home
for
some
days
apologies
of
the
most
profound
of
course
our
host
was
the
soul
of
courtesy
though
he
did
try
to
get
at
us
a
bit
later
we
expressed
our
polite
regrets
naturally
but
i
did
quite
see
at
first
what
difference
it
made
i
only
began
to
see
when
rangon
with
more
apologies
told
us
that
we
should
have
to
go
back
to
darbisson
for
dinner
it
appeared
that
when
madame
rangon
went
away
for
a
few
days
she
dispersed
the
whole
of
the
female
side
of
her
establishment
also
and
she
left
her
son
with
nobody
to
look
after
him
except
an
old
man
we
seen
in
the
yard
mending
one
of
these
they
clap
across
the
horse
back
and
drive
between
the
rows
of
vines
rangon
explained
all
this
as
we
stood
in
the
hall
drinking
an
a
hall
crowded
with
oak
furniture
and
photographs
and
a
and
doors
opening
to
right
and
left
to
the
other
rooms
of
the
ground
floor
he
had
also
it
seemed
to
ask
us
to
be
so
infinitely
obliging
as
to
excuse
him
for
one
hour
after
dinner
our
postcard
had
come
unexpectedly
he
said
and
already
he
had
made
an
appointment
with
his
agent
about
the
for
the
coming
autumn
we
begged
him
of
course
not
to
allow
us
to
interfere
with
his
business
in
the
slightest
degree
he
thanked
us
a
thousand
times
though
we
dine
in
the
village
we
will
take
our
own
wine
with
us
he
said
wine
one
of
my
wines
you
shall
see
then
he
showed
us
round
his
place
i
forget
how
many
hundreds
of
acres
of
vines
and
into
the
great
building
with
the
presses
and
pumps
and
casks
and
the
huge
barrel
they
call
the
thunderbolt
and
about
seven
we
walked
back
to
darbisson
to
dinner
carrying
our
wine
with
us
i
think
the
restaurant
we
dined
in
was
the
only
one
in
the
place
and
our
gaillard
of
a
host
he
was
a
chap
with
rather
fine
eyes
did
us
on
the
whole
pretty
well
his
wine
certainly
was
good
stuff
and
set
our
tongues
going
a
moment
ago
i
said
a
fellow
like
rangon
leads
a
restricted
sort
of
life
in
those
parts
i
saw
this
more
clearly
as
dinner
went
on
we
dined
by
an
open
window
from
which
we
could
see
the
stream
with
the
planks
across
it
where
the
women
washed
clothes
during
the
day
and
assembled
in
the
evening
for
gossip
there
were
a
dozen
or
so
of
them
there
as
we
dined
laughing
and
chatting
in
low
tones
they
all
seemed
pretty
it
was
quickly
falling
dusk
all
the
girls
are
pretty
then
and
are
quite
conscious
of
it
know
marsham
behind
them
at
the
end
of
the
street
one
of
these
great
cypress
showed
black
against
the
sky
a
ragged
edge
something
like
the
line
the
needle
draws
on
a
rainfall
chart
and
you
could
only
tell
whether
they
were
men
or
women
under
the
plantains
by
their
voices
rippling
and
chattering
and
suddenly
a
deeper
note
once
i
heard
a
muffled
scuffle
and
a
sound
like
a
kiss
it
was
then
that
rangon
little
trouble
came
out
it
seemed
that
he
did
know
any
girls
was
allowed
to
know
any
girls
the
girls
of
the
village
were
pretty
enough
but
you
see
how
it
was
he
a
position
to
keep
up
appearances
to
maintain
could
be
familiar
during
the
year
with
the
girls
who
gathered
his
grapes
for
him
in
the
autumn
and
as
soon
as
carroll
gave
him
a
chance
began
to
ask
questions
about
england
english
girls
the
liberty
they
had
and
so
on
of
course
we
could
tell
him
much
he
had
heard
already
but
that
made
no
difference
he
could
stand
any
amount
of
that
our
strapping
young
and
he
asked
us
questions
by
the
dozen
that
we
both
tried
to
answer
at
once
and
his
delight
and
envy
what
in
england
did
the
young
men
see
the
young
women
of
their
own
class
without
restraint
the
sisters
of
their
friends
even
at
the
house
was
it
permitted
that
they
drank
tea
with
them
in
the
afternoon
or
went
without
invitation
to
pass
the
he
had
all
the
later
prévosts
in
his
room
he
told
us
i
do
doubt
he
had
the
earlier
ones
also
prévost
and
the
disestablishment
between
them
must
be
playing
the
mischief
with
the
convent
system
of
education
for
young
girls
and
our
young
man
was
what
call
it
by
jove
yes
he
seemed
to
marvel
that
we
should
have
left
a
country
so
blessed
as
england
to
visit
his
dusty
provence
you
do
know
half
your
luck
marsham
well
we
talked
after
this
fashion
we
left
the
of
the
restaurant
and
had
planted
ourselves
on
a
bench
outside
with
rangon
between
us
when
rangon
suddenly
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
it
was
time
he
was
off
to
see
this
agent
of
his
would
we
take
a
walk
he
asked
us
and
meet
him
again
there
he
said
but
as
his
agent
lived
in
the
direction
of
his
own
home
we
said
we
meet
him
at
the
house
in
an
hour
or
so
off
he
went
envying
every
englishman
who
stepped
i
doubt
i
told
you
how
old
how
young
we
were
heigho
well
off
goes
rangon
and
carroll
and
i
got
up
stretched
ourselves
and
took
a
walk
we
walked
a
mile
or
so
until
it
began
to
get
pretty
dark
and
then
turned
and
it
was
as
we
came
into
the
blackness
of
one
of
these
cypress
hedges
that
the
thing
i
telling
you
of
happened
the
hedge
took
a
sharp
turn
at
that
point
as
we
came
round
the
angle
we
saw
a
couple
of
women
figures
hardly
more
than
twenty
yards
ahead
know
how
they
got
there
so
suddenly
i
sure
and
that
same
moment
i
found
my
foot
on
something
small
and
white
and
glimmering
on
the
grass
i
picked
it
up
it
was
a
handkerchief
a
woman
embroidered
the
two
figures
ahead
of
us
were
walking
in
our
direction
there
was
every
probability
that
the
handkerchief
belonged
to
one
of
them
so
we
stepped
out
at
my
madame
and
lifted
hat
one
of
the
figures
turned
her
head
then
to
my
surprise
she
spoke
in
english
cultivated
english
i
held
out
the
handkerchief
it
belonged
to
the
elder
lady
of
the
two
the
one
who
had
spoken
a
very
old
lady
older
by
very
many
years
than
her
companion
she
took
the
handkerchief
and
thanked
me
somebody
sterne
is
it
says
that
englishmen
do
travel
to
see
englishmen
i
do
know
whether
he
stand
to
that
in
the
case
of
englishwomen
carroll
and
i
did
we
were
walking
rather
slowly
along
four
abreast
across
the
road
we
asked
permission
to
introduce
ourselves
did
so
and
received
some
name
in
return
which
strangely
enough
i
entirely
forgotten
i
only
remember
that
the
ladies
were
aunt
and
niece
and
lived
at
darbisson
they
shook
their
heads
when
i
mentioned
rangon
name
and
said
we
were
visiting
him
they
know
him
i
never
been
in
darbisson
before
and
i
have
been
since
so
i
know
the
map
of
the
village
very
well
but
the
place
is
very
big
and
the
house
at
which
we
stopped
in
twenty
minutes
or
so
is
probably
there
yet
it
had
a
large
double
door
a
double
door
in
two
senses
for
it
was
a
big
with
a
smaller
door
inside
it
and
an
iron
grille
shutting
in
the
whole
the
old
lady
had
already
taken
a
key
from
her
reticule
and
was
thanking
us
again
for
the
little
service
of
the
handkerchief
then
with
the
little
gesture
one
makes
when
one
has
found
oneself
on
the
point
of
omitting
a
courtesy
she
gave
a
little
musical
laugh
she
said
with
a
little
movement
of
invitation
sees
so
few
compatriots
here
if
you
have
the
time
to
come
in
and
smoke
a
cigarette
also
the
cigarette
she
added
with
another
rippling
laugh
we
have
few
callers
and
live
alone
hastily
as
i
was
about
to
accept
carroll
was
before
me
professing
a
nostalgia
for
the
sound
of
the
english
tongue
that
made
his
recent
protestations
about
provençal
a
shameless
hypocrisy
persuasive
young
rascal
carroll
was
poor
chap
so
the
elder
lady
opened
the
grille
and
the
wooden
door
beyond
it
and
we
entered
by
the
light
of
the
candle
which
the
younger
lady
took
from
a
bracket
just
within
the
door
we
saw
that
we
were
in
a
handsome
hall
or
vestibule
and
my
wonder
that
rangon
had
made
no
mention
of
what
was
apparently
a
considerable
establishment
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
its
tenants
must
be
known
to
be
english
and
could
be
seen
to
be
entirely
charming
i
could
understand
it
and
i
afraid
hypotheses
rushed
into
my
head
that
cast
doubts
on
the
rangons
you
know
whether
were
all
right
we
knew
nothing
about
our
young
planter
you
see
i
looked
about
me
there
were
tubs
here
and
there
against
the
walls
gaily
painted
with
aloes
and
palms
in
them
one
of
the
aloes
i
remember
was
flowering
a
little
fountain
in
the
middle
made
a
tinkling
noise
we
put
our
caps
on
a
carved
and
gilt
console
table
and
before
us
rose
a
broad
staircase
with
shallow
steps
of
spotless
stone
and
a
beautiful
handrail
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
were
more
palms
and
aloes
and
double
doors
painted
in
a
clear
grey
we
followed
our
hostesses
up
the
staircase
i
can
hear
yet
the
sharp
clean
click
our
boots
made
on
that
hard
shiny
stone
see
the
lights
of
the
candle
gleaming
on
the
handrail
the
young
girl
she
was
not
much
more
than
a
girl
pushed
at
the
doors
and
we
went
in
the
room
we
entered
was
all
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
for
rather
fineness
it
was
large
lofty
beautifully
kept
carroll
went
round
for
miss
whatever
her
name
was
lighting
candles
in
sconces
and
as
the
flames
crept
up
they
glimmered
on
a
beautifully
polished
floor
which
was
bare
except
for
an
eastern
rug
here
and
there
the
elder
lady
had
sat
down
in
a
gilt
chair
louis
fourteenth
i
should
say
with
a
striped
rep
of
the
colour
of
a
petunia
and
i
really
know
do
smile
smith
what
induced
me
to
lead
her
to
it
by
the
bending
over
her
hand
for
a
moment
as
she
sat
down
there
was
an
old
behind
her
chair
i
remember
and
a
vast
oval
mirror
with
clustered
filled
the
greater
part
of
the
farther
wall
the
brightest
and
clearest
glass
i
ever
seen
he
paused
looking
at
my
cigarette
case
which
he
had
taken
into
his
hand
again
he
smiled
at
some
recollection
or
other
and
it
was
a
minute
or
so
before
he
continued
i
must
admit
that
i
found
it
a
little
annoying
after
what
been
talking
about
at
dinner
an
hour
before
that
rangon
was
with
us
i
still
could
understand
how
he
could
have
neighbours
so
charming
without
knowing
about
them
but
i
did
care
to
insist
on
this
to
the
old
lady
who
for
all
i
knew
might
have
her
own
reasons
for
keeping
to
herself
and
after
all
it
was
our
place
to
return
rangon
hospitality
in
london
if
he
ever
came
there
not
so
to
speak
on
his
own
doorstep
so
presently
i
forgot
all
about
rangon
and
pretty
sure
that
carroll
who
was
talking
to
his
companion
of
some
félibrige
junketing
or
other
and
having
the
air
of
gounod
hummed
softly
over
to
him
did
waste
a
thought
on
him
either
soon
carroll
you
remember
what
a
pretty
crooning
humming
voice
he
had
soon
carroll
was
murmuring
what
they
call
but
so
low
that
the
sound
hardly
came
across
the
room
and
i
came
in
with
a
soft
bass
note
from
time
to
time
no
instrument
you
know
just
an
unaccompanied
murmur
no
louder
than
an
aeolian
harp
and
it
sounded
infinitely
sweet
and
plaintive
and
what
shall
i
say
weak
attenuated
faint
you
might
almost
say
in
that
formal
rather
with
that
great
clear
oval
mirror
throwing
back
the
still
flames
of
the
candles
in
the
sconces
on
the
walls
outside
the
wind
had
now
fallen
completely
all
was
very
quiet
and
suddenly
in
a
voice
not
much
louder
than
a
sigh
carroll
companion
was
singing
in
the
stilly
you
know
it
he
broke
off
again
to
murmur
the
beginning
of
the
air
then
with
a
little
laugh
for
which
we
saw
no
reason
he
went
on
again
well
i
not
going
to
try
to
convince
you
of
such
a
special
and
delicate
thing
as
the
charm
of
that
hour
it
was
more
than
an
hour
it
would
be
all
about
an
hour
we
stayed
things
like
that
just
have
to
be
said
and
left
you
destroy
them
the
moment
you
begin
to
insist
on
them
we
every
one
of
us
had
experiences
like
that
and
do
say
much
about
them
i
was
as
much
in
love
with
my
old
lady
as
carroll
evidently
was
with
his
young
one
i
ca
tell
you
why
being
in
love
has
just
to
be
taken
for
granted
too
i
suppose
marsham
understands
we
smoked
our
cigarettes
and
sang
again
once
more
filling
that
quiet
apartment
with
a
murmuring
no
louder
than
if
a
light
breeze
found
that
the
bells
of
a
bed
of
flowers
were
really
bells
and
played
on
the
old
lady
moved
her
fingers
gently
on
the
round
table
by
the
side
of
her
chair
oh
infinitely
pretty
it
was
then
carroll
wandered
off
into
the
awfully
pretty
is
not
for
myself
i
sing
but
for
my
friend
who
is
near
me
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
like
four
old
friends
we
were
those
two
so
oddly
met
ladies
and
carroll
and
myself
and
so
to
in
the
stilly
again
but
for
all
the
sweetness
and
the
glamour
of
it
we
could
stay
on
indefinitely
and
i
wondered
what
time
it
was
but
did
ask
anything
to
do
with
clocks
and
watches
would
have
seemed
a
cold
and
mechanical
sort
of
thing
just
then
and
when
presently
we
both
got
up
neither
carroll
nor
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
call
again
in
the
morning
to
thank
them
for
a
charming
hour
and
they
seemed
to
feel
the
same
as
we
did
about
it
there
was
no
that
we
should
meet
again
in
london
neither
an
au
revoir
nor
a
just
a
tacit
understanding
that
that
hour
should
remain
isolated
accepted
like
a
good
gift
without
looking
the
in
the
mouth
single
unattached
to
any
hours
before
or
after
i
do
know
whether
you
see
what
i
mean
give
me
a
match
somebody
and
so
we
left
with
no
more
than
looks
exchanged
and
resting
between
the
back
of
our
hands
and
our
lips
for
a
moment
we
found
our
way
out
by
ourselves
down
that
staircase
with
the
handsome
handrail
and
let
ourselves
out
of
the
double
door
and
grille
closing
it
softly
we
made
for
the
village
without
speaking
a
word
heigho
loder
had
picked
up
the
cigarette
case
again
but
for
all
the
way
his
eyes
rested
on
it
i
doubt
whether
he
really
saw
it
i
pretty
sure
he
did
i
knew
when
he
did
by
the
glance
he
shot
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
i
see
you
wondering
where
the
cigarette
case
comes
he
resumed
with
another
little
laugh
well
he
continued
we
got
back
to
rangon
house
i
really
blame
rangon
for
the
way
he
took
it
when
we
told
him
you
know
he
thought
we
were
pulling
his
leg
of
course
and
he
was
having
any
not
he
there
were
no
english
ladies
in
darbisson
he
said
we
told
him
as
nearly
as
we
could
just
where
the
house
was
we
were
very
precise
afraid
for
the
village
had
been
in
darkness
as
we
had
come
through
it
and
i
had
to
admit
that
the
cypress
hedge
i
tried
to
describe
where
met
our
friends
was
a
good
deal
like
other
cypress
hedges
and
as
i
say
rangon
was
taking
any
i
myself
was
rather
annoyed
that
he
should
think
we
were
returning
his
hospitality
by
trying
to
get
at
him
and
it
was
very
easy
either
to
explain
in
my
french
and
carroll
provençal
that
we
were
going
to
let
the
thing
stand
as
it
was
and
were
going
to
call
on
our
charming
friends
again
the
end
of
it
was
that
rangon
just
laughed
and
yawned
knew
it
was
good
my
wine
he
said
a
shrug
said
the
rest
so
good
as
all
that
he
meant
then
he
gave
us
our
candles
showed
us
to
our
rooms
shook
hands
and
marched
off
to
his
own
room
and
the
prévosts
i
dreamed
of
my
old
lady
half
the
night
after
coffee
the
next
morning
i
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
for
my
cigarette
case
and
did
find
it
i
went
through
all
my
pockets
and
then
i
asked
carroll
if
he
got
it
he
replied
you
left
it
behind
at
that
place
last
night
did
you
rangon
popped
in
with
a
twinkle
i
went
through
all
my
pockets
again
no
cigarette
case
of
course
it
was
possible
that
i
left
it
behind
and
i
was
annoyed
again
i
did
want
to
go
back
you
see
but
on
the
other
hand
i
did
want
to
lose
the
case
it
was
a
present
and
rangon
smile
nettled
me
a
good
deal
too
it
was
both
a
challenge
to
our
truthfulness
and
a
testimonial
to
that
very
good
wine
of
his
have
done
i
grunted
in
that
case
we
go
and
get
it
one
tried
the
restaurant
first
rangon
suggested
smiling
again
all
means
said
i
stuffily
though
i
remembered
having
the
case
after
we
left
the
restaurant
we
were
round
at
the
restaurant
by
nine
the
case
there
i
known
jolly
well
beforehand
it
was
and
i
saw
mouth
twitching
with
amusement
we
now
seek
the
abode
of
these
english
ladies
he
said
said
i
and
we
left
the
restaurant
and
strode
through
the
village
by
the
way
we
taken
the
evening
before
that
vigneron
smile
became
more
and
more
irritating
to
me
is
then
the
next
village
he
said
presently
as
we
left
the
last
house
and
came
out
into
the
open
plain
we
went
back
i
was
irritated
because
we
were
two
to
one
you
see
and
carroll
backed
me
up
double
door
with
a
grille
in
front
of
it
he
repeated
for
the
fiftieth
time
rangon
merely
replied
that
it
was
our
good
faith
he
doubted
he
did
actually
use
the
word
he
said
suddenly
trying
to
conceal
his
mirth
possible
si
a
double
door
with
a
grille
but
perhaps
that
i
know
it
the
domicile
of
these
so
elusive
ladies
come
this
way
he
took
us
back
along
a
street
and
suddenly
turned
up
an
alley
that
was
little
more
than
two
gutters
and
a
crack
of
sky
overhead
between
two
roofs
it
was
a
dilapidated
deserted
and
i
was
positively
angry
when
rangon
pointed
to
a
blistered
old
with
a
railing
in
front
of
it
it
that
your
house
he
asked
says
i
and
says
carroll
and
off
we
started
again
but
another
brought
us
back
to
the
same
place
and
carroll
scratched
his
head
lives
there
anyway
he
said
glowering
at
the
chin
forward
hands
in
pockets
says
rangon
as
much
as
to
say
at
it
then
meditates
taking
it
then
i
struck
in
quite
out
of
temper
by
this
time
much
would
the
rent
be
i
asked
as
if
i
really
thought
of
taking
the
place
just
to
get
back
at
him
he
mentioned
something
ridiculously
small
in
the
way
of
francs
might
at
least
see
the
place
says
i
the
key
be
got
he
bowed
the
key
was
at
the
baker
not
a
hundred
yards
away
he
said
we
got
the
key
it
was
the
key
of
the
inner
wooden
door
that
grid
of
rusty
iron
did
need
one
it
came
clean
off
its
single
hinge
when
carroll
touched
it
carroll
opened
and
we
stood
for
a
moment
motioning
to
one
another
to
step
in
then
rangon
went
in
first
and
i
heard
him
murmur
now
this
is
the
odd
part
we
passed
into
a
sort
of
vestibule
or
hall
with
a
burst
lead
pipe
in
the
middle
of
a
dry
tank
in
the
centre
of
it
there
was
a
broad
staircase
rising
in
front
of
us
to
the
first
floor
and
double
doors
just
seen
in
the
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
old
tubs
stood
against
the
walls
but
the
palms
and
aloes
in
them
were
dead
only
a
or
two
and
the
rusty
hoops
lay
on
the
ground
about
them
one
tub
had
come
to
pieces
entirely
and
was
no
more
than
a
heap
of
staves
on
a
pile
of
spilt
earth
and
everywhere
everywhere
was
dust
the
floor
was
an
inch
deep
in
dust
and
old
plaster
that
muffled
our
footsteps
cobwebs
hung
like
old
dusters
on
the
walls
a
regular
tatter
of
cobwebs
draped
the
little
bracket
inside
the
door
and
the
of
the
was
closed
up
with
webs
in
which
not
even
a
spider
moved
the
whole
thing
was
preposterous
is
possible
that
for
even
a
less
rental
rangon
murmured
dragging
his
forefinger
across
the
and
leaving
an
furrow
upstairs
said
i
suddenly
up
we
went
all
was
in
the
same
state
there
a
clutter
of
stuff
came
down
as
i
pushed
at
the
double
doors
of
the
and
i
had
to
strike
a
stinking
french
sulphur
match
to
see
into
the
room
at
all
underfoot
was
like
walking
on
thicknesses
of
flannel
and
except
where
we
put
our
feet
the
place
was
as
printless
as
a
snowfield
dust
dust
unbroken
grey
dust
my
match
burned
down
a
minute
i
a
said
carroll
and
struck
the
wax
match
there
were
the
old
sconces
with
never
a
in
them
there
was
the
large
oval
mirror
but
hardly
reflecting
carroll
match
for
the
dust
on
it
and
the
broken
chairs
were
there
all
gutless
and
the
rickety
old
round
table
but
suddenly
i
darted
forward
something
new
and
bright
on
the
table
twinkled
with
the
light
of
carroll
match
the
match
went
out
and
by
the
time
carroll
had
lighted
another
i
had
stopped
i
wanted
rangon
to
see
what
was
on
the
table
see
by
my
footprints
how
far
from
that
table
been
i
said
you
pick
it
up
and
rangon
stepping
forward
picked
up
from
the
middle
of
the
table
my
cigarette
case
loder
had
finished
nobody
spoke
for
quite
a
minute
nobody
spoke
and
then
loder
himself
broke
the
silence
turning
to
me
make
anything
of
it
he
said
i
lifted
my
eyebrows
only
your
explanation
i
began
but
stopped
again
seeing
that
would
do
make
anything
of
it
said
loder
turning
from
one
to
another
i
gathered
from
smith
face
that
he
thought
one
thing
might
be
made
of
it
namely
that
loder
had
invented
the
whole
tale
but
even
smith
did
speak
were
any
english
ladies
ever
found
to
have
lived
in
the
place
murdered
you
know
bodies
found
and
all
that
young
marsham
asked
diffidently
yearning
for
an
obvious
completeness
not
that
we
could
ever
learn
loder
replied
we
made
inquiries
too
so
you
all
give
it
up
well
so
do
i
and
he
rose
as
he
walked
to
the
door
myself
following
him
to
get
his
hat
and
stick
i
heard
him
humming
softly
the
lines
they
are
from
in
the
stilly
seem
like
one
who
treads
alone
some
deserted
whose
guests
are
fled
whose
garlands
dead
and
all
but
he
departed
the
rocker
i
there
was
little
need
for
the
swart
gipsies
to
explain
as
they
stood
in
the
snow
round
the
bailiff
of
the
abbey
farm
what
it
was
that
had
sent
them
the
unbroken
whiteness
of
the
uplands
told
that
and
even
as
they
spoke
there
came
up
the
hill
the
dark
figures
of
the
farm
men
with
shovels
on
their
way
to
dig
out
the
sheep
in
the
summer
the
bailiff
would
have
been
the
first
to
call
the
gipsies
vagabonds
and
now
they
had
women
with
them
too
the
hares
and
foxes
were
down
four
days
ago
and
the
pumps
like
a
snow
man
the
bailiff
said
yes
you
can
lie
in
the
laithes
and
welcome
if
you
can
find
maybe
you
help
us
find
our
sheep
too
the
gipsies
had
done
so
coming
back
again
they
had
had
some
ado
to
discover
the
spot
where
their
three
caravans
made
a
hummock
of
white
against
a
broken
wall
the
women
they
had
four
women
with
them
began
that
afternoon
to
weave
the
mats
and
baskets
they
hawked
from
door
to
door
and
in
the
forenoon
of
the
following
day
one
of
them
the
quean
whom
the
bailiff
had
heard
called
annabel
set
her
babe
in
the
sling
on
her
back
tucked
a
bundle
of
long
under
her
oxter
and
trudged
down
between
walls
of
snow
to
the
abbey
farm
she
stood
in
the
latticed
porch
dark
and
handsome
against
the
whiteness
and
then
advancing
put
her
head
into
the
great
has
the
lady
any
chairs
for
the
gipsy
woman
to
mend
she
asked
in
a
soft
and
insinuating
voice
they
brought
her
the
old
chairs
she
seated
herself
on
a
box
in
the
porch
and
there
she
wove
the
strips
of
cane
in
and
out
securing
each
one
with
a
little
wooden
peg
and
a
tap
of
her
hammer
the
child
remained
in
the
sling
at
her
back
taking
the
breast
from
time
to
time
over
her
shoulder
and
the
silver
wedding
ring
could
be
seen
as
she
whipped
the
cane
back
and
forth
as
she
worked
she
cast
curious
glances
into
the
old
the
snow
outside
cast
a
pallid
upward
light
on
the
heavy
this
was
reflected
in
the
polished
stone
floor
and
the
children
who
at
first
had
shyly
stopped
their
play
seeing
the
strange
woman
in
the
porch
the
nearest
thing
they
had
seen
to
gipsies
before
had
been
the
old
itinerant
glazier
with
his
frame
of
glass
on
his
back
resumed
it
but
still
eyed
her
from
time
to
time
in
the
ancient
walnut
chair
by
the
hearth
sat
the
old
old
lady
who
had
told
them
to
bring
the
chairs
her
hair
almost
as
white
as
the
snow
itself
was
piled
up
on
her
head
la
she
was
knitting
but
now
and
then
she
allowed
the
needle
in
the
little
wooden
sheath
at
her
waist
to
lie
idle
closed
her
eyes
and
rocked
softly
in
the
old
walnut
chair
ask
the
woman
who
is
mending
the
chairs
whether
she
is
warm
enough
there
the
old
lady
said
to
one
of
the
children
and
the
child
went
to
the
porch
with
the
message
thank
you
little
missie
thank
you
lady
dear
annabel
is
quite
warm
said
the
soft
voice
and
the
child
returned
to
the
play
it
was
a
childish
game
of
funerals
at
which
the
children
played
the
hand
of
death
hovering
over
the
dolls
had
singled
out
flora
the
articulations
of
whose
sawdust
body
were
seams
and
whose
boots
were
painted
on
her
calves
of
fibrous
plaster
for
the
greater
solemnity
the
children
had
made
themselves
sweeping
trains
of
the
garments
of
their
elders
and
those
with
cropped
curls
had
draped
their
heads
with
shawls
the
fringes
of
which
they
had
combed
out
with
their
fingers
to
simulate
hair
long
hair
such
as
sabrina
the
eldest
had
hanging
so
low
down
her
back
that
she
could
almost
sit
on
it
a
horse
convertible
when
his
flat
head
came
out
of
its
socket
into
a
locomotive
headed
the
sad
then
came
the
defunct
flora
then
came
jack
the
raffish
sailor
doll
with
other
dolls
and
the
children
followed
with
hushed
whisperings
the
youngest
of
the
children
passed
the
walnut
chair
in
which
the
old
lady
sat
she
stopped
aunt
rachel
she
whispered
slowly
and
gravely
opening
very
wide
and
closing
very
tight
her
eyes
yes
dear
flora
dead
the
old
lady
when
she
smiled
did
so
less
with
her
lips
than
with
her
faded
cheeks
so
sweet
was
her
face
that
you
could
not
help
wondering
when
you
looked
on
it
how
many
men
had
also
looked
upon
it
and
loved
it
somehow
you
never
wondered
how
many
of
them
had
been
loved
in
return
i
so
sorry
dear
aunt
rachel
who
in
reality
was
a
said
what
did
she
die
of
this
time
she
died
of
brown
titus
now
she
going
to
be
buried
in
a
grave
as
little
as
her
bed
in
a
what
dear
as
little
dread
as
little
as
my
bed
you
say
it
sabrina
she
means
aunt
rachel
me
to
live
that
i
may
dread
the
grave
as
little
as
my
bed
sabrina
the
eldest
interpreted
ah
but
wo
you
play
at
cheerful
things
dears
yes
we
will
presently
aunt
rachel
gee
up
horse
shall
we
go
and
ask
the
if
she
warm
enough
do
dears
again
the
message
was
taken
and
this
time
it
seemed
as
if
annabel
the
gipsy
was
not
warm
enough
for
she
gathered
up
her
loops
of
cane
and
brought
the
chair
she
was
mending
a
little
way
into
the
itself
she
sat
down
on
the
square
box
they
used
to
cover
the
sewing
machine
thank
you
lady
dear
she
murmured
lifting
her
handsome
almond
eyes
to
aunt
rachel
aunt
rachel
did
not
see
the
long
furtive
curious
glance
her
own
eyes
were
closed
as
if
she
was
tired
her
cheeks
were
smiling
one
of
them
had
dropped
a
little
to
one
shoulder
as
it
might
have
dropped
had
she
held
in
her
arms
a
babe
and
she
was
rocking
softly
slowly
the
rocker
of
the
chair
making
a
little
regular
noise
on
the
polished
floor
the
gipsy
woman
beckoned
to
one
of
the
children
tell
the
lady
when
she
wakes
that
i
will
tack
a
strip
of
felt
to
the
rocker
and
then
it
will
make
no
noise
at
all
said
the
low
and
wheedling
voice
and
the
child
retired
again
the
interment
of
flora
proceeded
an
hour
later
flora
had
taken
up
the
burden
of
life
again
it
was
as
angela
the
youngest
was
chastising
her
for
some
offence
that
sabrina
the
eldest
looked
with
wondering
eyes
on
the
babe
in
the
gipsy
sling
she
approached
on
tiptoe
may
i
look
at
it
please
she
asked
timidly
the
gipsy
set
one
shoulder
forward
and
sabrina
put
the
shawl
gently
aside
peering
at
the
dusky
brown
morsel
within
sometime
perhaps
if
i
very
careful
sabrina
ventured
diffidently
if
i
careful
may
i
hold
it
before
replying
the
gipsy
once
more
turned
her
almond
eyes
towards
aunt
rachel
chair
aunt
rachel
had
been
awakened
for
the
conclusion
of
flora
funeral
but
her
eyes
were
closed
again
now
and
once
more
her
cheek
was
dropped
in
that
tender
suggestive
little
gesture
and
she
rocked
but
you
could
see
that
she
was
not
properly
asleep
it
was
somehow
less
to
sabrina
still
peering
at
the
babe
in
the
sling
than
to
aunt
rachel
apparently
asleep
that
the
gipsy
seemed
to
reply
you
know
some
day
little
missis
that
a
wean
knows
its
own
pair
of
arms
her
seductive
voice
came
and
aunt
rachel
heard
she
opened
her
eyes
with
a
start
the
little
regular
noise
of
the
rocker
ceased
she
turned
her
head
quickly
tremulously
she
began
to
knit
again
and
as
her
eyes
rested
on
the
sidelong
eyes
of
the
gipsy
woman
there
was
an
expression
in
them
that
almost
resembled
fright
ii
they
began
to
deck
the
great
for
christmas
but
the
snow
still
lay
thick
over
hill
and
valley
and
the
gipsies
caravans
remained
by
the
broken
wall
where
the
drifts
had
overtaken
them
though
all
the
chairs
were
mended
annabel
still
came
daily
to
the
farm
sat
on
the
box
they
used
to
cover
the
sewing
machine
and
wove
mats
as
she
wove
them
aunt
rachel
knitted
and
from
time
to
time
fragments
of
talk
passed
between
the
two
women
it
was
always
the
lady
who
spoke
first
and
annabel
made
all
sorts
of
salutes
and
obeisances
with
her
eyes
before
replying
i
have
not
seen
your
husband
aunt
rachel
said
to
annabel
one
day
the
children
at
the
other
end
of
the
apartment
had
converted
a
chest
into
an
altar
and
were
solemnising
the
nuptials
of
the
resurrected
flora
and
jack
the
raffish
annabel
made
roving
play
with
her
eyes
he
is
up
at
the
caravans
lady
dear
she
replied
is
there
anything
annabel
can
bid
him
do
nothing
thank
you
said
aunt
rachel
for
a
minute
the
gipsy
watched
aunt
rachel
and
then
she
got
up
from
the
sewing
machine
box
and
crossed
the
floor
she
leaned
so
close
towards
her
that
she
had
to
put
up
a
hand
to
steady
the
babe
at
her
back
lady
dear
she
murmured
with
irresistible
softness
your
husband
died
did
he
on
aunt
rachel
finger
was
a
ring
but
it
was
not
a
wedding
ring
it
was
a
hoop
of
pearls
i
have
never
had
a
husband
she
said
the
gipsy
glanced
at
the
ring
then
that
is
that
is
a
betrothal
ring
aunt
rachel
replied
ah
said
annabel
then
after
a
minute
she
drew
still
closer
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
aunt
rachel
and
the
insinuating
voice
was
very
low
ah
and
did
die
too
lady
dear
again
came
that
quick
look
into
aunt
rachel
face
her
eyes
avoided
those
of
the
gipsy
sought
them
and
avoided
them
again
did
what
die
she
asked
slowly
and
guardedly
the
child
at
the
gipsy
back
did
not
need
suck
nevertheless
fingers
worked
at
her
bosom
and
she
moved
the
sling
as
the
child
settled
annabel
gave
aunt
rachel
a
long
look
why
do
you
rock
she
asked
slowly
aunt
rachel
was
trembling
she
did
not
reply
in
a
voice
soft
as
sliding
water
the
gipsy
continued
lady
dear
we
are
a
strange
folk
to
you
and
even
among
us
there
are
those
who
shuffle
the
pack
of
cards
and
read
the
palm
when
silver
has
been
put
upon
it
knowing
nothing
but
some
of
us
some
of
us
it
was
more
than
a
minute
before
aunt
rachel
spoke
you
are
a
woman
and
you
have
your
babe
at
your
breast
now
every
woman
sees
the
thing
you
speak
of
but
the
gipsy
shook
her
head
you
speak
of
seeing
with
the
heart
i
speak
of
eyes
these
eyes
again
came
a
long
pause
aunt
rachel
had
given
a
little
start
but
had
become
quiet
again
when
at
last
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
that
can
not
be
i
know
what
you
mean
but
it
can
not
be
he
died
on
the
eve
of
his
wedding
for
my
bridal
clothes
they
made
me
black
garments
instead
it
is
long
ago
and
now
i
wear
neither
black
nor
white
but
her
hands
made
a
gesture
aunt
rachel
always
dressed
as
if
to
suit
a
sorrow
that
time
had
deprived
of
bitterness
in
such
a
tender
and
fleecy
grey
as
one
sees
in
the
mists
that
lie
like
lawn
over
hedgerow
and
copse
early
of
a
midsummer
morning
therefore
she
resumed
your
heart
may
see
but
your
eyes
can
not
see
that
which
never
was
but
there
came
a
sudden
note
of
masterfulness
into
the
gipsy
voice
with
my
eyes
eyes
she
repeated
pointing
to
them
aunt
rachel
kept
her
own
eyes
obstinately
on
her
knitting
needles
none
except
i
have
seen
it
it
is
not
to
be
seen
she
said
the
gipsy
sat
suddenly
erect
it
is
not
so
keep
still
in
your
chair
she
ordered
and
i
will
tell
you
when
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
followed
as
if
all
the
will
went
out
of
her
aunt
rachel
sat
very
still
and
presently
her
hands
fluttered
and
dropped
the
gipsy
sat
with
her
own
hands
folded
over
the
mat
on
her
knees
several
minutes
passed
then
slowly
once
more
that
sweetest
of
smiles
stole
over
aunt
rachel
cheeks
once
more
her
head
dropped
her
hands
moved
noiselessly
on
the
rockers
that
the
gipsy
had
padded
with
felt
the
chair
began
to
rock
annabel
lifted
one
hand
se
she
said
it
is
there
aunt
rachel
did
not
appear
to
hear
her
with
that
ineffable
smile
still
on
her
face
she
rocked
then
after
some
minutes
there
crossed
her
face
such
a
look
as
visits
the
face
of
one
who
waking
from
sleep
strains
his
faculties
to
recapture
some
blissful
and
vanishing
vision
it
is
gone
said
the
gipsy
woman
aunt
rachel
opened
her
eyes
again
she
repeated
dully
after
annabel
it
is
gone
ghosts
the
gipsy
whispered
presently
are
of
the
dead
therefore
it
must
have
lived
but
again
aunt
rachel
shook
her
head
it
never
lived
you
were
young
and
beautiful
still
the
shake
of
the
head
he
died
on
the
eve
of
his
wedding
they
took
my
white
garments
away
and
gave
me
black
ones
how
then
could
it
have
lived
without
the
kiss
no
but
sometimes
a
woman
will
lie
through
her
life
and
at
the
graveside
still
will
lie
tell
me
the
truth
but
they
were
the
same
words
that
aunt
rachel
repeated
he
died
on
the
eve
of
his
wedding
they
took
away
my
wedding
garments
from
her
lips
a
lie
could
hardly
issue
the
gipsy
face
became
grave
she
broke
another
long
silence
i
believe
she
said
at
last
it
is
a
new
kind
but
no
more
wonderful
than
the
other
the
other
i
have
seen
now
i
have
seen
this
also
tell
me
does
it
come
to
any
other
chair
it
was
his
chair
he
died
in
it
said
aunt
rachel
and
you
shall
you
die
in
it
as
god
wills
has
visited
it
long
many
years
but
it
is
always
small
it
never
grows
to
their
mothers
babes
never
grow
they
remain
ever
babes
none
other
has
ever
seen
it
except
yourself
none
i
sit
here
presently
it
creeps
into
my
arms
it
is
small
and
warm
i
rock
and
then
it
goes
would
it
come
to
another
chair
i
can
not
tell
i
think
not
it
was
his
chair
annabel
mused
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
flora
was
now
bestowed
on
jack
the
disreputable
sailor
the
gipsy
eyes
rested
on
the
bridal
party
yet
another
might
see
it
none
has
no
but
yet
the
door
does
not
always
shut
behind
us
suddenly
perhaps
one
who
has
toddled
but
a
step
or
two
over
the
threshold
might
by
looking
back
catch
a
glimpse
what
is
the
name
of
the
smallest
one
angela
that
means
look
the
doll
who
died
yesterday
is
now
being
married
it
may
be
that
life
has
not
yet
sealed
the
little
one
eyes
will
you
let
annabel
ask
her
if
she
sees
what
it
is
you
hold
in
your
arms
again
the
voice
was
soft
and
wheedling
no
annabel
said
aunt
rachel
faintly
will
you
rock
again
aunt
rachel
made
no
reply
rock
urged
the
cajoling
voice
but
aunt
rachel
only
turned
the
betrothal
ring
on
her
finger
over
at
the
altar
jack
was
leering
at
his
bride
past
decency
and
little
angela
held
the
wooden
horse
head
which
had
parted
from
its
body
rock
and
comfort
yourself
tempted
the
voice
then
slowly
aunt
rachel
rose
from
her
chair
no
annabel
she
said
gently
you
should
not
have
spoken
when
the
snow
melts
you
will
go
and
come
no
more
why
then
did
you
speak
it
was
mine
it
was
not
meant
to
be
seen
by
another
i
no
longer
want
it
please
go
the
swarthy
woman
turned
her
almond
eyes
on
her
once
more
you
can
not
live
without
it
she
said
as
she
also
rose
and
as
jack
and
his
bride
left
the
church
on
the
reheaded
horse
aunt
rachel
walked
with
hanging
head
from
the
apartment
iii
thenceforward
as
day
followed
day
aunt
rachel
rocked
no
more
and
with
the
packing
and
partial
melting
of
the
snow
the
gipsies
up
at
the
caravans
judged
it
time
to
be
off
about
their
business
it
was
on
the
morning
of
christmas
eve
that
they
came
down
in
a
body
to
the
abbey
farm
to
express
their
thanks
to
those
who
had
befriended
them
but
the
bailiff
was
not
there
he
and
the
farm
men
had
ceased
work
and
were
down
at
the
church
practising
the
carols
only
aunt
rachel
sat
still
and
knitting
in
the
black
walnut
chair
and
the
children
played
on
the
floor
a
night
in
the
had
apparently
bred
discontent
between
jack
and
flora
or
perhaps
they
sought
to
keep
their
countenances
before
the
world
at
any
rate
they
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
jack
keeping
boon
company
with
the
lead
soldiers
his
spouse
reposing
her
eyes
closed
in
the
broken
clockwork
with
the
air
of
performing
some
vaguely
momentous
ritual
the
children
were
kissing
one
another
beneath
the
bunch
of
mistletoe
that
hung
from
the
centre
beam
in
the
intervals
of
kissing
they
told
one
another
in
whispers
that
aunt
rachel
was
not
very
well
and
angela
woke
flora
to
tell
her
that
aunt
rachel
had
brown
titus
also
stay
you
here
i
will
give
the
lady
dear
our
thanks
said
annabel
to
the
group
of
gipsies
gathered
about
the
porch
and
she
entered
the
great
she
approached
the
chair
in
which
aunt
rachel
sat
there
was
obeisance
in
the
bend
of
her
body
but
command
in
her
long
almond
eyes
as
she
spoke
lady
dear
you
must
rock
or
you
can
not
live
aunt
rachel
did
not
look
up
from
her
work
rocking
i
should
not
live
long
she
replied
we
are
leaving
you
all
leave
me
annabel
fears
she
has
taken
away
your
comfort
only
for
a
little
while
the
door
closes
behind
us
but
it
opens
again
but
for
that
little
time
rock
aunt
rachel
shook
her
head
no
it
is
finished
another
has
seen
say
to
your
companions
they
are
very
welcome
to
what
they
have
had
and
god
speed
you
they
thank
you
lady
dear
will
you
not
forget
that
annabel
saw
and
rock
no
more
annabel
stooped
and
kissed
the
hand
that
bore
the
betrothal
hoop
of
pearls
the
other
hand
aunt
rachel
placed
for
a
moment
upon
the
smoky
head
of
the
babe
in
the
sling
it
trembled
as
it
rested
there
but
the
tremor
passed
and
annabel
turning
once
at
the
porch
gave
her
a
last
look
then
she
departed
with
her
companions
that
afternoon
jack
and
flora
had
shaken
down
to
wedlock
as
married
folk
should
and
sat
together
before
the
board
spread
with
the
the
pallid
light
in
the
great
faded
the
candles
were
lighted
and
then
the
children
first
borrowing
the
stockings
of
their
elders
to
hang
at
the
bed
foot
were
packed
off
early
for
it
was
the
custom
to
bring
them
down
again
at
midnight
for
the
carols
aunt
rachel
had
their
kisses
not
as
she
had
them
every
night
but
with
the
special
ceremony
of
the
mistletoe
other
folk
grown
folk
sat
with
aunt
rachel
that
evening
but
the
old
walnut
chair
did
not
move
upon
its
rockers
there
was
merry
talk
but
aunt
rachel
took
no
part
in
it
the
board
was
spread
with
ale
and
cheese
and
spiced
loaf
for
the
and
the
time
drew
near
for
their
coming
when
at
midnight
faintly
on
the
air
from
the
church
below
there
came
the
chiming
of
christmas
morning
all
bestirred
themselves
they
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
they
said
somebody
go
and
bring
the
children
down
and
within
a
very
little
while
subdued
noises
were
heard
outside
and
the
lifting
of
the
latch
of
the
yard
gate
the
children
were
in
their
nightgowns
hardly
fully
awake
a
low
voice
outside
was
heard
giving
orders
and
then
there
arose
on
the
night
the
carol
hush
they
said
to
the
wondering
children
listen
it
was
the
cherry
tree
carol
that
rose
outside
of
how
sweet
mary
the
queen
of
galilee
besought
joseph
to
pluck
the
cherries
for
her
babe
and
joseph
refused
and
the
voices
of
the
singers
that
had
begun
hesitatingly
grew
strong
and
loud
and
free
and
joseph
would
pluck
the
cherries
somebody
was
whispering
to
the
tiny
angela
said
to
cherry
tree
down
to
my
knee
that
i
may
pluck
cherries
for
my
babe
and
the
carollers
sang
and
now
listen
darling
the
one
who
held
angela
murmured
uppermost
spray
then
bowed
down
to
her
knee
you
may
see
joseph
these
cherries
are
for
me
eat
your
cherries
mary
give
them
your
babe
now
o
eat
your
cherries
mary
that
grew
upon
the
the
little
angela
within
the
arms
that
held
her
murmured
it
the
gipsies
is
it
mother
no
darling
the
gipsies
have
gone
it
the
singing
because
jesus
was
born
but
mother
it
the
gipsies
is
it
look
look
where
at
aunt
rachel
mother
the
gipsy
woman
would
go
without
her
little
baby
would
she
no
she
would
do
that
then
has
she
it
to
aunt
rachel
like
i
lend
my
new
toys
sometimes
the
mother
glanced
across
at
aunt
rachel
and
then
gathered
the
figure
more
closely
the
darling
only
half
awake
she
murmured
poor
aunt
sleepy
too
aunt
rachel
her
head
dropped
her
hands
lightly
folded
as
if
about
some
shape
that
none
saw
but
herself
her
face
again
ineffable
with
that
sweet
and
peaceful
smile
was
once
more
rocking
softly
in
her
chair
hic
jacet
a
tale
of
artistic
conscience
introduction
as
i
lighted
my
guests
down
the
stairs
of
my
chelsea
lodgings
turned
up
the
hall
gas
that
they
might
see
the
steps
at
the
front
door
and
shook
hands
with
them
i
bade
them
good
night
the
more
heartily
that
i
was
glad
to
see
their
backs
lest
this
should
seem
but
an
inhospitable
confession
let
me
state
first
that
they
had
invited
themselves
dropping
in
in
ones
and
twos
until
seven
or
eight
of
them
had
assembled
in
my
garret
and
secondly
that
i
was
rather
extraordinarily
curious
to
know
why
at
close
on
midnight
the
one
i
knew
least
well
of
all
had
seen
fit
to
remain
after
the
others
had
taken
their
departure
to
these
two
considerations
i
must
add
a
third
namely
that
i
had
become
tardily
conscious
that
if
andriaovsky
had
not
lingered
of
himself
i
should
certainly
have
asked
him
to
do
so
it
was
to
nothing
more
than
a
glance
swift
and
momentary
directed
by
andriaovsky
to
myself
while
the
others
had
talked
that
i
traced
this
desire
to
see
more
of
the
little
polish
painter
but
a
glance
derives
its
import
from
the
circumstance
under
which
it
is
given
that
rapid
turning
of
his
eyes
in
my
direction
an
hour
before
had
held
a
hundred
questions
implications
criticisms
incredulities
condemnations
it
had
been
one
of
those
uncovenanted
gestures
that
hold
the
promise
of
the
treasures
of
an
eternal
friendship
i
wondered
as
i
turned
down
the
gas
again
and
remounted
the
stairs
what
personal
message
and
reproach
in
it
had
lumped
me
in
with
the
others
and
by
the
time
i
had
reached
my
own
door
again
a
phrase
had
fitted
itself
in
my
mind
to
that
quick
ironical
turning
of
andriaovsky
eyes
et
tu
brute
he
was
standing
where
i
had
left
him
his
small
shabby
figure
in
the
attitude
of
a
diminutive
colossus
on
my
hearthrug
about
him
were
the
recently
vacated
chairs
solemnly
and
ridiculously
suggestive
of
still
continuing
the
high
and
choice
conversation
that
had
lately
finished
the
same
fancy
had
evidently
taken
andriaovsky
for
he
was
turning
from
chair
to
chair
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
mischievously
and
aggravatingly
smiling
as
one
of
them
the
deep
wicker
chair
that
jamison
had
occupied
suddenly
gave
a
little
creak
of
itself
as
wicker
will
when
released
from
a
strain
his
smile
broadened
to
a
grin
i
had
been
on
the
point
of
sitting
down
in
that
chair
but
i
changed
my
mind
and
took
another
that
right
said
andriaovsky
in
that
wonderful
english
which
he
had
picked
up
in
less
than
three
years
do
sit
in
the
you
might
profane
it
i
knew
what
he
meant
i
felt
for
my
pipe
and
slowly
filled
it
not
replying
then
slowly
wagging
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
his
eyes
humorously
and
banteringly
on
mine
he
uttered
the
very
words
i
had
mentally
associated
with
that
glance
of
his
et
tu
brute
he
said
wagging
away
so
that
with
each
wag
the
lenses
of
his
spectacles
caught
the
light
of
the
lamp
on
the
table
i
too
smiled
as
i
felt
for
a
match
it
rather
much
was
it
i
said
but
he
suddenly
stopped
his
wagging
and
held
up
a
not
very
clean
forefinger
his
whole
face
was
altogether
too
confoundedly
intelligent
oh
no
you
do
he
said
peremptorily
no
getting
out
of
it
like
that
the
moment
they
turned
their
backs
no
running
what
is
it
no
running
with
the
hare
and
hunting
with
the
hounds
helped
you
know
i
confess
i
fidgeted
a
little
but
hang
it
all
what
could
i
do
they
were
in
my
place
i
broke
out
he
chuckled
enjoying
my
discomfiture
then
his
eyes
fell
on
those
absurd
and
solemn
chairs
again
look
at
the
art
shades
in
conference
he
chuckled
that
one
it
was
talking
half
an
hour
ago
about
in
silver
and
grey
nice
fresh
green
stuff
to
shut
him
up
i
told
him
that
he
would
find
cigarettes
and
tobacco
on
the
table
in
silver
and
grey
he
chuckled
again
as
he
took
a
cigarette
all
this
perhaps
needs
some
explanation
it
had
been
the
usual
thing
usual
in
those
days
twenty
years
ago
smarming
about
art
and
the
arts
and
so
forth
they
we
as
apparently
andriaovsky
had
lingered
behind
for
the
purpose
of
reminding
me
had
perhaps
talked
a
little
more
soaringly
than
the
ordinary
that
was
all
there
had
been
jamison
in
the
wicker
chair
full
to
the
lips
and
running
over
with
the
colour
suggestions
of
the
late
edward
calvert
gibbs
in
a
pulpy
state
of
adoration
of
the
less
legitimate
side
of
the
painting
of
watts
and
magnani
who
had
advanced
that
an
essential
oneness
underlies
all
the
arts
and
had
triumphantly
proved
his
thesis
by
analogy
with
the
law
of
the
of
forces
a
book
called
music
and
morals
had
appeared
about
that
time
and
on
it
they
we
had
risen
to
regions
of
lunacy
about
colour
symphonies
orgies
of
formless
colour
thrown
on
a
screen
vieux
jeu
enough
at
this
time
of
day
a
young
newspaper
man
too
had
made
mental
notes
of
our
adjectives
for
use
in
his
weekly
i
nearly
spelt
it
weakly
of
art
criticism
and
and
here
was
andriaovsky
grinning
at
the
chairs
and
mimicking
it
all
with
diabolical
glee
in
silver
and
grey
pastels
lyrics
in
stone
he
chuckled
and
what
was
it
the
fat
fellow
said
a
siren
song
in
marble
phew
well
i
get
along
i
shall
just
be
in
time
to
get
a
pint
of
bitter
to
wash
it
all
down
if
i
quick
bah
he
broke
out
suddenly
good
men
build
up
form
and
forms
keep
the
arts
each
after
its
kind
raise
up
the
dikes
so
that
we
sha
all
be
swept
away
by
night
and
nothingness
and
these
rats
come
nosing
and
burrowing
and
undermining
it
all
tu
brute
well
when
you
finished
rubbing
it
in
i
grunted
as
if
did
know
better
is
that
your
way
of
getting
back
on
now
that
you
chucked
drawing
and
gone
in
for
writing
books
phew
i
well
i
go
and
get
my
pint
of
beer
but
he
did
go
for
his
pint
of
beer
instead
he
began
to
prowl
about
my
room
pryingly
nosingly
touching
things
here
and
there
i
watched
him
as
he
passed
from
one
thing
to
another
he
was
very
little
and
very
very
shabby
his
trousers
were
frayed
and
the
sole
of
one
of
his
boots
flapped
distressingly
his
old
bowler
hat
he
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
wait
until
he
got
outside
before
thrusting
it
on
the
back
of
his
head
was
so
limp
in
substance
that
i
verily
believed
that
had
he
run
incautiously
downstairs
he
would
have
found
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
that
its
crown
had
sunk
in
of
its
own
weight
in
spite
of
his
remark
about
the
pint
of
beer
i
doubt
if
he
had
the
price
of
one
in
his
pocket
what
this
brutus
a
concertina
he
suddenly
asked
stopping
before
the
collapsible
case
in
which
i
kept
my
rather
old
dress
suit
i
told
him
what
it
was
and
he
hoisted
up
his
shoulders
and
these
things
he
asked
moving
to
something
else
they
were
a
pair
of
of
which
i
had
permitted
myself
the
economy
i
remember
they
cost
me
four
shillings
in
the
old
brompton
road
and
that
your
bath
i
suppose
too
and
good
lord
he
had
picked
up
and
dropped
again
as
if
it
had
been
hot
somebody
or
other
card
with
the
date
of
a
day
written
across
the
corner
of
it
as
i
helped
him
on
with
his
overcoat
he
made
no
secret
of
the
condition
of
its
armholes
and
lining
i
do
for
one
moment
suppose
that
the
garment
was
his
i
took
a
candle
to
light
him
down
as
soon
as
it
should
please
him
to
depart
well
so
long
and
joy
to
you
on
the
high
road
to
success
he
said
with
another
grin
for
which
i
could
have
bundled
him
down
the
stairs
in
later
days
i
never
looked
to
andriaovsky
for
tact
but
i
stared
at
him
for
his
lack
of
it
that
night
and
as
i
stared
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
broad
and
low
pylon
of
his
forehead
his
handsome
mouth
and
chin
and
the
fire
and
wit
and
scorn
that
smouldered
behind
his
cheap
spectacles
i
looked
again
and
his
smallness
his
malice
his
pathetic
little
braggings
about
his
poverty
seemed
all
to
disappear
he
had
strolled
back
to
my
hearthrug
wishing
i
have
no
doubt
now
to
be
able
to
exclaim
suddenly
that
it
was
too
late
for
the
pint
of
beer
for
which
he
had
the
money
and
to
curse
his
luck
and
the
pigmy
quality
of
his
colossusship
had
somehow
gone
as
i
watched
him
a
neighbouring
clock
struck
the
and
he
did
even
as
i
had
surmised
cursed
the
closing
time
of
the
english
i
lighted
him
down
for
one
moment
under
the
hall
gas
he
almost
dropped
his
jesting
manner
you
know
better
harrison
you
know
he
said
but
of
course
you
going
to
be
a
famous
author
in
almost
no
time
oh
se
no
garrets
for
it
was
a
treat
the
way
you
handled
those
fellows
really
well
do
forget
us
others
when
you
up
there
i
may
want
you
to
write
my
some
day
i
heard
the
slapping
of
the
loose
sole
as
he
shuffled
down
the
path
at
the
gate
he
turned
for
a
moment
good
night
brutus
he
called
when
i
had
mounted
to
my
garret
again
my
eyes
fell
once
more
on
that
ridiculous
assemblage
of
empty
chairs
all
solemnly
talking
to
one
another
i
burst
out
into
a
laugh
then
i
undressed
put
my
jacket
on
the
hanger
took
the
morrow
boots
from
the
trees
and
treed
those
i
had
removed
changed
the
pair
of
trousers
under
my
mattress
and
went
still
laughing
at
the
chairs
to
bed
this
was
michael
andriaovsky
the
polish
painter
who
died
four
weeks
ago
i
i
knew
the
reason
of
maschka
visit
the
moment
she
was
announced
even
in
the
stressful
moments
of
the
funeral
she
had
found
time
to
whisper
to
me
that
she
hoped
to
call
upon
me
at
an
early
date
i
dismissed
the
amanuensis
to
whom
i
was
dictating
the
last
story
of
the
fourth
series
of
gave
a
few
hasty
instructions
to
my
secretary
and
told
the
servant
to
show
miss
andriaovsky
into
the
to
ask
her
to
be
so
good
as
to
excuse
me
for
five
minutes
to
order
tea
at
once
and
then
to
bring
my
visitor
up
to
the
library
a
few
minutes
later
she
was
shown
into
the
room
she
was
dressed
in
the
same
plainly
cut
costume
of
dead
black
she
had
worn
at
the
funeral
and
had
pushed
up
her
heavy
veil
over
the
cap
of
black
fur
that
accentuated
her
sclavonic
appearance
i
noticed
again
with
distress
the
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
bistred
rings
that
weeks
of
nursing
had
put
under
her
dark
eyes
i
noticed
also
her
resemblance
in
feature
and
stature
to
her
brother
i
placed
a
chair
for
her
the
followed
her
in
and
without
more
than
a
murmured
greeting
she
peeled
off
her
gloves
and
prepared
to
preside
at
the
tray
she
had
filled
the
cups
and
i
had
handed
her
toast
before
she
spoke
then
i
suppose
you
know
what
i
come
about
she
said
i
nodded
long
long
ago
you
promised
it
nobody
else
can
do
it
the
only
question
is
that
the
only
question
i
agreed
we
naturally
she
continued
after
a
glance
in
which
her
eyes
mutely
thanked
me
for
my
implied
promise
are
anxious
that
it
should
be
as
soon
as
possible
but
of
course
i
shall
quite
understand
she
gave
a
momentary
glance
round
my
library
i
helped
her
out
you
mean
that
i
a
very
important
person
nowadays
and
that
afraid
to
trespass
on
my
time
never
mind
that
i
shall
find
time
for
this
but
tell
me
before
we
go
any
further
exactly
how
you
stand
and
precisely
what
it
is
you
expect
briefly
she
did
so
it
did
not
in
the
least
surprise
me
to
learn
that
her
brother
had
died
penniless
and
if
you
had
undertaken
the
she
said
he
might
just
as
well
not
have
worked
in
poverty
all
these
years
you
can
at
least
see
to
his
fame
i
nodded
again
gravely
and
ruminated
for
a
moment
then
i
spoke
i
can
write
it
fully
and
in
detail
up
to
five
years
ago
i
said
you
know
what
happened
then
i
tried
my
best
to
help
him
but
he
never
would
let
me
tell
me
maschka
why
he
would
sell
me
that
portrait
i
knew
instantly
from
her
quick
confusion
that
her
brother
had
spoken
to
her
about
the
portrait
he
had
refused
to
sell
me
and
had
probably
told
her
the
reason
for
his
refusal
i
watched
her
as
she
evaded
the
question
as
well
as
she
could
you
know
how
queer
he
was
about
who
he
sold
his
things
to
and
as
for
those
five
years
in
which
you
saw
less
of
him
schofield
will
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
i
relinquished
the
point
who
schofield
i
asked
instead
he
was
a
very
good
friend
of
michael
of
both
of
us
you
can
talk
quite
freely
to
him
i
want
to
say
at
the
beginning
that
i
should
like
him
to
be
associated
with
you
in
this
i
do
know
how
i
divined
on
the
spot
her
relation
to
schofield
whoever
he
was
she
told
me
that
he
too
was
a
painter
michael
thought
very
highly
of
his
things
she
said
i
do
know
them
i
replied
you
probably
would
she
returned
but
i
caught
the
quick
drop
of
her
eyes
from
their
brief
excursion
round
my
library
and
i
felt
something
within
me
stiffen
a
little
it
did
not
need
maschka
andriaovsky
to
remind
me
that
i
had
not
attained
my
position
without
let
us
say
splitting
certain
differences
the
looseness
of
the
expression
can
be
corrected
hereafter
life
consists
very
largely
of
compromises
you
doubtless
know
my
name
whichever
country
or
hemisphere
you
happen
to
live
in
as
that
of
the
creator
of
martin
renard
the
famous
and
popular
detective
and
i
was
not
at
that
moment
disposed
to
apologise
either
to
maschka
or
schofield
or
anybody
else
for
having
written
the
stories
at
the
bidding
of
a
gaping
public
the
moment
the
public
showed
that
it
wanted
something
better
i
was
prepared
to
give
it
in
the
meantime
i
sat
in
my
very
comfortable
library
securely
shielded
from
distress
by
my
balance
at
my
banker
well
i
said
after
a
moment
let
see
how
we
stand
and
first
as
to
what
you
likely
to
get
out
of
this
it
goes
without
saying
of
course
that
by
writing
the
i
can
get
you
any
amount
of
advertisement
newspaper
talk
and
all
the
things
that
it
struck
me
michael
always
treated
with
especial
scorn
my
name
alone
i
say
will
do
that
but
for
anything
else
i
by
no
means
so
sure
you
see
i
explained
it
does
follow
that
because
i
can
sell
hundreds
of
thousands
of
you
know
what
that
i
can
sell
anything
i
a
mind
to
sign
i
said
it
confident
that
she
had
not
lived
all
those
years
with
her
brother
without
having
learned
the
axiomatic
nature
of
it
to
my
discomfiture
she
began
to
talk
like
a
callow
student
i
should
have
thought
that
it
followed
that
if
you
could
sell
something
she
hesitated
only
for
a
moment
then
courageously
gave
the
other
stuff
its
proper
adjective
something
rotten
you
could
have
sold
something
good
when
you
had
the
chance
then
if
you
thought
that
you
were
wrong
i
replied
briefly
and
concisely
could
of
course
she
said
putting
michael
out
of
the
question
with
a
little
wave
of
her
hand
because
michael
was
i
mean
michael
was
a
business
man
you
are
i
speaking
as
one
i
replied
i
do
waste
time
in
giving
people
what
they
do
want
that
is
business
i
do
undertake
your
as
a
matter
of
business
but
as
an
inestimable
privilege
i
repeat
it
does
follow
that
the
public
will
buy
it
but
but
she
stammered
the
public
will
buy
a
if
they
see
your
name
on
the
testimonial
a
pill
yes
i
said
sadly
genius
and
a
pill
were
alas
different
things
but
i
added
more
cheerfully
you
can
never
tell
what
the
public
will
do
they
buy
it
there
no
telling
except
by
trying
well
schofield
thinks
they
will
she
informed
me
with
decision
i
dare
say
he
does
if
he
an
artist
they
mostly
do
i
replied
he
does
think
michael
will
ever
be
popular
she
emphasised
the
adjective
slightly
but
he
does
think
he
has
a
considerable
following
if
they
could
only
be
discovered
i
sighed
all
artists
think
that
they
will
accept
any
compromise
except
the
one
that
is
offered
to
them
i
tried
to
explain
to
maschka
that
in
this
world
we
have
to
stand
to
the
chances
of
all
or
nothing
you
got
to
be
one
thing
or
the
other
i
do
know
that
it
matters
very
much
which
i
said
there
michael
way
and
there
mine
that
all
however
we
try
it
all
you
can
say
to
me
and
more
say
to
a
publisher
for
you
but
he
probably
wink
at
me
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
then
she
said
schofield
rather
fancies
one
publisher
oh
who
he
i
asked
she
mentioned
a
name
if
i
knew
anything
at
all
of
business
she
might
as
well
have
offered
life
of
michael
to
the
religious
tract
society
at
once
hm
and
has
schofield
any
other
suggestions
i
inquired
he
had
several
i
saw
that
schofield
position
would
have
to
be
defined
before
we
went
any
further
hm
i
said
again
well
i
shall
have
to
rely
on
schofield
for
those
five
years
in
which
i
saw
little
of
michael
but
unless
schofield
knows
more
of
publishing
than
i
do
and
can
enforce
a
better
contract
and
a
larger
sum
on
account
than
i
can
i
really
think
maschka
that
you
do
better
to
leave
things
to
me
for
one
thing
it
only
fair
to
me
my
name
has
much
of
an
artistic
value
nowadays
but
it
has
a
very
considerable
commercial
one
and
my
worth
to
publishers
is
as
a
writer
of
the
lives
of
geniuses
i
could
see
she
did
like
it
but
that
could
be
helped
it
had
to
be
so
then
as
we
sat
for
a
time
in
silence
over
the
fire
i
noticed
again
how
like
her
brother
she
was
she
was
not
it
was
true
much
like
him
as
he
had
been
on
that
last
visit
of
mine
to
him
and
i
sighed
as
i
remembered
that
visit
the
dreadful
scene
had
come
back
to
me
on
account
i
suppose
of
the
divergence
of
our
paths
i
had
not
even
heard
of
his
illness
until
almost
the
finish
immediately
i
had
hastened
to
the
hampstead
home
only
to
find
him
already
in
the
agony
he
had
not
been
too
far
gone
to
recognise
me
however
for
he
had
muttered
something
brokenly
about
knowing
better
that
a
spasm
had
interrupted
besides
myself
only
maschka
had
been
there
and
i
had
been
thankful
for
the
summons
that
had
called
her
for
a
moment
out
of
the
room
i
had
still
retained
his
already
cold
hand
his
brow
had
worked
with
that
dreadful
struggle
and
his
eyes
had
been
closed
but
suddenly
he
had
opened
them
and
the
next
moment
had
sat
up
on
his
pillow
he
had
striven
to
draw
his
hand
from
mine
who
are
you
he
had
suddenly
demanded
not
knowing
me
i
had
come
close
to
him
you
know
me
andriaovsky
harrison
i
had
asked
sorrowfully
i
had
been
on
the
point
of
repeating
my
name
but
suddenly
after
holding
my
eyes
for
a
moment
with
a
look
the
profundity
and
familiarity
of
which
i
can
not
express
he
had
broken
into
the
most
ghastly
haunting
laugh
i
have
ever
heard
the
words
had
broken
throatily
from
him
yes
i
know
you
you
shall
very
soon
know
that
i
know
you
if
if
the
cough
and
rattle
had
come
as
maschka
had
rushed
into
the
room
in
ten
seconds
andriaovsky
had
fallen
back
dead
ii
that
same
evening
i
began
to
make
notes
for
andriaovsky
life
on
the
following
day
the
last
of
the
fourth
series
of
the
occupied
me
until
i
was
thankful
to
get
to
bed
but
thereafter
i
could
call
rather
more
of
my
time
my
own
and
i
began
in
good
earnest
to
devote
myself
to
the
life
maschka
had
spoken
no
more
than
the
truth
when
she
had
said
that
of
all
men
living
none
but
i
could
write
that
life
his
remaining
behind
in
my
chelsea
garret
that
evening
after
the
others
had
left
had
been
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
that
barring
that
lapse
of
five
years
at
the
end
had
been
for
twenty
years
one
of
completest
intimacy
whatever
money
there
might
or
might
not
be
in
the
book
i
had
seen
opportunity
in
it
the
opportunity
to
make
it
the
vehicle
for
all
the
aspirations
faiths
enthusiasms
and
exaltations
we
had
shared
and
i
myself
did
not
realise
until
i
began
to
note
them
down
one
tithe
of
the
subtle
links
and
associations
that
had
welded
our
souls
together
even
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
these
had
been
wonderful
setting
out
from
one
or
other
of
the
score
of
garrets
and
cheap
lodgings
we
had
in
our
time
inhabited
we
had
wandered
together
day
after
day
night
after
night
far
down
east
where
as
we
had
threaded
our
way
among
the
barrels
of
soused
herrings
and
the
stalls
and
barrows
of
unleavened
bread
he
had
taught
me
scraps
of
hebrew
and
polish
and
yiddish
up
into
the
bright
west
where
he
could
never
walk
a
quarter
of
a
mile
without
meeting
one
of
his
extraordinary
acquaintances
furred
managers
hawkers
of
bootlaces
commercial
magnates
of
his
own
faith
touts
painted
women
into
soho
where
he
had
names
for
the
very
horses
on
the
and
the
dogs
who
slumbered
under
the
counters
of
the
sellers
of
french
literature
out
to
the
and
cries
of
the
saturday
night
street
markets
of
islington
and
the
north
end
road
into
city
churches
on
wintry
afternoons
into
the
studios
of
famous
artists
full
of
handsomely
dressed
women
into
the
studios
of
artists
not
famous
at
the
ends
of
dark
and
corridors
to
tea
at
the
suburban
homes
of
barmaids
and
chorus
girls
to
dinner
in
the
stables
of
a
to
supper
in
cabmen
shelters
he
was
possessed
in
some
mysterious
way
of
the
passwords
to
doors
in
hoardings
behind
which
excavations
were
in
progress
he
knew
by
name
the
butchers
of
the
deptford
yards
the
men
in
the
clothes
so
inured
to
blood
that
they
may
not
with
safety
to
their
lives
swear
at
one
another
he
took
me
into
an
within
a
of
oxford
street
and
into
a
to
call
upon
certain
friends
of
his
well
they
they
were
fire
extinguishers
so
i
better
not
say
they
were
bombs
up
down
here
there
good
report
but
more
frequently
evil
we
had
known
this
side
of
our
london
as
well
as
two
men
may
and
our
other
adventures
and
peregrinations
not
of
the
body
but
of
the
spirit
but
these
must
be
spoken
of
in
their
proper
place
i
had
arranged
with
maschka
that
schofield
should
bring
me
the
whole
of
the
work
andriaovsky
had
left
behind
him
and
he
arrived
late
one
afternoon
in
a
fourwheeler
with
four
great
packages
done
up
in
brown
paper
i
found
him
to
be
a
big
lancashire
man
of
given
to
confidential
demonstrations
at
the
length
of
a
quite
unconscious
of
the
gulf
between
his
words
and
his
right
to
employ
them
and
bent
on
asserting
an
equality
that
i
did
not
dispute
by
a
rather
aggressive
use
of
my
surname
andriaovsky
had
appointed
him
his
executor
and
he
had
ever
the
air
of
suspecting
that
the
appointment
was
going
to
be
challenged
a
glad
to
be
associated
with
ye
in
this
melancholy
duty
harrison
he
said
now
we
wo
waste
words
miss
andriaovsky
has
told
me
precisely
how
matters
stand
i
had
as
ye
know
the
honour
to
be
poor
close
friend
for
a
period
of
five
years
and
my
knowledge
of
him
is
entirely
at
your
disposal
i
answered
that
i
should
be
seriously
handicapped
without
it
just
so
it
is
miss
andriaovsky
desire
that
we
should
pull
together
now
in
the
firrst
place
what
is
your
idea
about
the
forrm
the
book
should
take
in
the
first
place
if
you
do
mind
i
replied
perhaps
we
better
run
over
together
the
things
you
brought
the
daylight
will
be
gone
soon
just
as
ye
like
harrison
he
said
just
as
ye
like
it
all
the
same
to
me
i
cleared
a
space
about
my
at
the
window
and
we
turned
to
the
artistic
remains
of
michael
andriaovsky
i
was
astonished
first
at
the
enormous
quantity
of
the
stuff
and
next
at
its
utter
and
complete
revelation
of
the
man
in
a
flash
i
realised
how
superb
that
portion
at
least
of
the
book
was
going
to
be
and
schofield
explained
that
the
work
he
had
brought
represented
but
a
fraction
of
the
whole
that
was
at
our
disposal
ye
know
with
what
foolish
generosity
poor
michael
always
gave
his
things
away
he
said
hallard
has
a
grand
set
so
has
connolly
and
from
time
to
time
he
behaved
varry
handsomely
to
myself
artists
of
varry
considerable
talents
both
hallard
and
connolly
are
michael
thought
varry
highly
of
their
abilities
they
express
the
deepest
interest
in
the
shape
your
worrk
will
take
and
that
reminds
me
i
myself
have
drafted
a
rough
scenario
of
the
forrm
it
appeared
to
me
the
might
with
advantage
be
cast
in
a
purely
private
opinion
ye
understand
harrison
which
ye
be
entirely
at
liberty
to
disregard
well
let
finish
with
the
work
first
i
said
with
boards
loose
sheets
scraps
of
paper
notes
studies
canvases
stretched
and
stripped
from
their
stretchers
we
paved
half
the
library
floor
schofield
keeping
up
all
the
time
a
running
fire
of
grand
grand
a
masterpiece
a
gem
that
harrison
they
were
all
that
he
said
and
presently
i
ceased
to
hear
his
voice
the
splendour
of
the
work
issued
undimmed
even
from
the
severe
test
of
schofield
praise
and
i
thought
again
with
pride
how
i
i
was
the
only
man
living
who
could
adequately
write
that
are
they
grand
are
they
great
schofield
chanted
monotonously
they
are
i
replied
coming
to
a
consciousness
of
his
presence
again
but
what
that
secretively
he
had
kept
one
package
until
the
last
he
now
removed
its
wrappings
and
set
it
against
a
chair
there
he
cried
i
thank
ye
harrison
for
your
opinion
of
it
was
the
portrait
andriaovsky
had
refused
to
sell
me
a
portrait
of
himself
the
portrait
was
the
climax
of
the
display
the
lancastrian
still
talked
but
i
profoundly
moved
mechanically
gathered
up
the
drawings
from
the
floor
and
returned
them
to
their
proper
packages
and
folios
i
was
dining
at
home
alone
that
evening
and
for
form
sake
i
asked
this
faithful
dog
of
andriaovsky
to
share
my
meal
but
he
excused
himself
he
was
dining
with
hallard
and
connolly
when
the
drawings
were
all
put
away
all
save
that
portrait
he
gave
an
inquisitive
glance
round
my
library
it
was
the
same
glance
as
maschka
had
given
when
she
had
feared
to
intrude
on
my
time
but
schofield
did
these
things
with
a
much
more
heavy
hand
he
departed
but
not
before
telling
me
that
even
my
mansion
contained
such
treasures
as
it
had
never
held
before
that
evening
after
glancing
at
schofield
scenario
i
carefully
folded
it
up
again
for
return
to
him
lest
when
the
book
should
appear
he
should
miss
the
pleasure
of
saying
that
i
had
had
his
guidance
but
had
disregarded
it
then
i
sat
down
at
my
and
took
out
the
loose
notes
i
had
made
i
made
other
jottings
each
on
a
blank
sheet
for
subsequent
amplification
and
the
sheets
overspread
the
large
table
and
thrust
one
another
up
the
standard
of
the
incandescent
with
the
pearly
silk
shade
the
firelight
shone
low
and
richly
in
the
dusky
spaces
of
the
large
apartment
and
the
thick
carpet
and
the
double
doors
made
the
place
so
quiet
that
i
could
hear
my
watch
ticking
in
my
pocket
i
worked
for
an
hour
and
then
for
the
purpose
of
making
yet
other
notes
i
rose
crossed
the
room
and
took
down
the
three
or
four
illustrated
books
to
which
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
career
andriaovsky
had
put
his
name
i
carried
them
to
the
table
and
twinkled
as
i
opened
the
first
of
them
it
was
a
book
of
poems
and
in
making
the
designs
for
them
andriaovsky
had
certainly
found
for
himself
almost
any
one
of
the
art
shades
as
he
had
called
them
could
have
done
the
thing
equally
well
and
i
twinkled
again
i
did
not
propose
to
have
much
mercy
on
already
schofield
words
had
given
birth
to
a
suspicion
in
my
mind
that
andriaovsky
in
permitting
these
fellows
hallard
connolly
and
the
rest
to
suppose
that
he
thought
highly
of
them
and
their
work
had
been
giving
play
to
that
malicious
humour
of
his
and
they
naturally
did
not
see
the
joke
that
joke
too
was
between
himself
dead
and
me
preparing
to
write
his
life
as
if
he
had
been
there
to
hear
me
i
chuckled
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
you
were
pulling
their
legs
michael
you
know
a
little
rough
on
them
you
were
but
there
a
book
here
of
yours
that
i
going
to
tell
the
truth
about
you
and
i
wo
pretend
to
one
another
it
a
rotten
book
and
both
you
and
i
know
it
i
do
know
what
it
was
that
caused
me
suddenly
to
see
just
then
something
that
i
had
been
looking
at
long
enough
without
seeing
that
portrait
of
himself
that
i
had
set
leaning
against
the
back
of
a
chair
at
the
end
of
my
it
stood
there
just
within
the
soft
penumbra
of
shadow
cast
by
the
light
the
canvas
had
been
enlarged
the
seam
of
it
clumsily
sewn
by
andriaovsky
own
hand
but
in
that
the
rough
ridge
of
paint
did
not
show
and
i
confess
that
the
position
and
effect
of
the
thing
startled
me
for
a
moment
had
i
cared
to
play
a
trick
with
my
fancy
i
could
have
imagined
the
head
wagging
from
side
to
side
with
such
rage
and
fire
was
it
painted
he
had
had
the
temerity
to
dash
a
reflection
across
one
of
the
glasses
of
his
spectacles
concealing
the
eye
behind
it
the
next
moment
i
had
given
a
short
laugh
so
you
there
are
you
well
i
know
you
agree
very
heartily
about
that
book
of
poems
heigho
if
i
remember
rightly
you
made
more
money
out
of
that
book
than
out
of
the
others
put
together
but
i
going
to
tell
the
truth
about
it
know
better
you
know
chancing
before
i
turned
in
that
night
to
reopen
one
of
his
folios
i
came
across
a
drawing
there
by
accident
i
do
doubt
that
confirmed
me
in
my
suspicion
that
andriaovsky
had
had
his
quiet
joke
with
schofield
hallard
connolly
and
co
it
was
a
sketch
of
schofield
imitative
deplorable
a
dreadful
of
incapacity
well
enough
drawn
in
a
sense
it
was
and
i
remembered
how
andriaovsky
had
ever
urged
that
drawing
of
itself
did
not
exist
i
winked
at
the
portrait
i
saw
his
point
he
himself
had
no
peer
and
rather
than
invite
comparison
with
stars
of
the
second
magnitude
he
chose
his
intimates
from
among
the
peddlers
of
the
wares
that
had
the
least
possible
connection
with
his
art
he
too
had
understood
that
the
compromise
must
be
entirely
accepted
or
totally
refused
and
while
in
the
divergence
of
our
paths
he
had
done
the
one
thing
and
i
the
other
we
had
each
done
it
thoroughly
with
vigour
and
with
persistence
and
each
could
esteem
the
other
if
not
as
a
at
least
as
an
honourable
and
opposite
iii
within
a
fortnight
i
was
so
deep
in
my
task
that
in
the
realest
sense
the
greater
part
of
my
life
was
in
the
past
the
significance
of
those
extraordinary
peregrinations
of
ours
had
been
in
the
opportunity
they
had
afforded
for
a
communion
of
brain
and
spirit
of
unusual
rarity
and
all
this
determined
to
my
work
with
the
accumulated
force
of
its
long
i
have
spoken
of
andriaovsky
contempt
for
such
as
had
the
conception
of
their
work
that
it
was
something
they
did
as
distinct
from
something
they
were
and
unless
i
succeed
in
making
it
plain
that
not
as
a
mere
figure
of
speech
and
loose
hyperbole
but
starkly
and
literally
andriaovsky
everything
he
did
my
tale
will
be
pointless
there
was
not
one
of
the
basic
facts
of
life
of
faith
honour
falsehood
betrayal
sin
that
he
did
not
turn
not
to
moral
interpretations
as
others
do
but
to
the
holy
purposes
of
his
noble
and
passionate
art
for
any
man
sin
is
only
mortal
when
it
is
sin
against
that
which
he
knows
to
be
immortally
true
and
the
things
andriaovsky
knew
to
be
immortally
true
were
the
things
that
he
had
gone
down
into
the
depths
in
order
to
bring
forth
and
place
upon
his
paper
or
canvas
these
things
are
not
for
the
perusal
of
many
unless
you
love
the
things
that
he
loved
with
a
fervour
comparable
in
kind
if
not
in
degree
with
his
own
you
may
not
come
near
them
truth
highest
thing
a
man
may
keep
he
said
can
not
be
brought
down
a
man
only
attains
it
by
proving
his
right
to
it
and
i
think
i
need
not
further
state
his
views
on
the
democratisation
of
art
of
any
result
from
the
elaborate
processes
of
he
held
out
no
hope
whatever
it
is
in
a
man
or
it
is
he
ever
declared
if
it
is
he
must
bring
it
out
for
himself
if
it
is
let
him
turn
to
something
useful
and
have
done
with
it
i
need
not
press
the
point
that
in
these
things
he
was
almost
a
solitary
he
made
of
these
general
despotic
principles
the
fiercest
personal
applications
i
have
heard
his
passionate
outbreak
of
thief
liar
fool
over
a
drawing
when
it
has
seemed
to
him
that
a
man
has
not
vouched
with
the
safety
of
his
immortal
soul
for
the
shapes
and
lines
he
has
committed
to
it
i
have
seen
him
get
into
such
a
rage
with
the
eyes
of
the
artist
upon
him
i
have
heard
the
ice
and
vinegar
of
his
words
when
a
good
man
for
money
has
consented
to
modify
and
emasculate
his
work
and
there
lingers
in
my
memory
his
side
of
a
telephone
conversation
in
which
he
told
a
publisher
who
had
suggested
that
he
should
do
the
same
thing
precisely
what
he
thought
of
him
and
on
the
other
hand
he
once
walked
from
aldgate
to
putney
hill
with
a
loose
heel
on
one
of
his
boots
to
see
a
man
of
whom
he
had
seen
but
a
single
drawing
see
him
he
did
too
in
spite
of
the
man
footman
his
liveried
parlourmaid
and
the
daunting
effect
of
the
electric
brougham
at
the
door
he
a
good
man
he
said
to
me
afterwards
ruefully
looking
at
the
place
where
his
had
been
you
got
to
take
your
good
where
you
find
it
i
do
care
whether
he
a
rich
amateur
or
in
a
garret
as
long
as
he
got
the
stuff
in
him
nobody
else
could
have
fetched
me
up
from
the
east
end
this
afternoon
so
long
see
you
in
a
week
or
so
this
was
the
only
time
i
ever
knew
him
break
that
sacred
time
in
which
he
celebrated
each
year
the
passover
and
the
feast
of
tabernacles
i
doubt
whether
this
observance
of
the
ritual
of
his
faith
was
of
more
essential
importance
to
him
than
that
other
philosophical
religion
towards
which
he
sometimes
leaned
i
have
said
what
his
real
religion
was
but
to
the
life
with
these
things
and
others
as
a
beginning
i
began
to
add
page
to
page
phase
to
phase
and
in
a
time
the
shortness
of
which
astonished
myself
i
had
pretty
well
covered
the
whole
of
the
first
ten
years
of
our
friendship
maschka
called
rather
less
and
schofield
rather
more
frequently
than
i
could
have
wished
and
my
surmise
that
he
at
least
was
in
love
with
her
quickly
became
a
certainty
this
was
to
be
seen
when
they
called
together
it
was
when
they
came
together
that
something
else
also
became
apparent
this
was
their
slightly
derisive
attitude
towards
the
means
by
which
i
had
attained
my
success
it
was
not
the
less
noticeable
that
it
took
the
form
of
compliments
on
the
outward
and
visible
results
singly
i
could
manage
them
together
they
were
inclined
to
get
a
little
out
of
hand
i
would
have
taxed
them
fairly
and
squarely
with
this
singly
or
together
but
for
one
thing
the
beautiful
ease
with
which
the
life
was
proceeding
never
had
i
felt
so
completely
with
my
subject
so
beautifully
was
the
thing
running
that
i
had
had
the
idle
fancy
of
some
actual
urge
from
andriaovsky
himself
and
each
night
before
sitting
down
to
work
i
set
his
portrait
at
my
desk
end
as
if
it
had
been
some
kind
of
an
observance
the
most
beautiful
result
of
all
was
that
i
felt
what
i
had
not
felt
for
five
years
that
i
too
was
not
doing
my
work
but
actually
living
and
being
it
at
times
i
took
up
the
sheets
i
had
written
as
ignorant
of
their
contents
as
if
they
had
proceeded
from
another
pen
so
freshly
they
came
to
me
and
once
i
vow
i
found
in
my
own
handwriting
a
polish
name
that
i
might
it
is
true
have
subconsciously
heard
at
some
time
or
other
but
that
stirred
no
chord
in
my
memory
even
when
i
saw
it
written
maschka
checked
and
confirmed
it
afterwards
and
i
did
not
tell
her
by
what
odd
circumstance
it
had
issued
from
my
pen
the
day
did
come
however
when
i
found
i
must
have
it
out
with
schofield
about
this
superciliousness
i
have
mentioned
the
had
just
begun
to
print
the
third
series
of
my
and
this
had
been
made
the
occasion
of
another
of
schofield
ponderous
compliments
i
acknowledged
it
with
none
too
much
graciousness
and
then
he
said
i
na
doubt
harrison
that
by
this
time
the
famous
of
crime
has
become
quite
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
to
ye
it
was
the
tone
as
much
as
the
words
that
riled
me
and
i
replied
that
his
doubts
or
the
lack
of
them
were
a
privacy
with
which
i
did
not
wish
to
meddle
from
being
merely
a
bore
the
fellow
was
rapidly
becoming
insolent
but
i
opine
he
get
wearisome
now
and
then
and
in
that
case
poor
michael
will
come
as
a
grand
relaxation
he
next
observed
if
i
meant
to
have
it
out
here
was
my
opportunity
i
should
have
thought
you
have
traced
a
closer
connection
than
that
between
the
two
things
i
remarked
he
shot
a
quick
glance
at
me
from
beneath
his
shaggy
russet
brows
how
so
i
see
varry
little
connection
he
said
suspiciously
there
this
connection
that
while
you
speak
with
some
freedom
of
what
i
do
you
are
quite
willing
to
take
advantage
of
it
when
it
serves
your
turn
harrison
he
said
slowly
of
the
advertisement
gives
you
i
must
point
out
that
you
condone
a
thing
when
you
accept
the
benefit
of
it
either
you
should
have
come
to
me
at
all
or
you
should
deny
yourself
the
gratification
of
these
slurs
slurrrrs
he
repeated
loweringly
both
of
you
you
and
miss
andriaovsky
or
maschka
as
i
call
her
do
suppose
i
do
know
as
well
as
you
do
the
exact
worth
of
my
as
you
call
him
you
did
come
to
me
solely
because
i
knew
andriaovsky
well
you
came
because
i
got
the
ear
of
the
public
also
and
i
tell
you
plainly
that
however
much
you
dislike
it
michael
fame
as
far
as
i
of
any
use
to
him
depends
on
the
popularity
of
renard
he
shook
his
big
head
this
is
what
i
feared
he
said
more
i
continued
you
can
depend
upon
it
that
michael
wherever
he
is
knows
all
about
that
ay
ay
he
said
sagely
i
misdoubt
your
own
artistic
soul
only
to
be
saved
by
the
writing
of
poor
michael
harrison
leave
that
to
me
and
michael
we
settle
that
in
the
meantime
if
you
do
like
it
write
and
publish
the
yourself
he
bent
his
brows
on
me
it
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
do
from
the
varry
first
he
said
if
you
cared
to
accept
my
symposium
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
offered
i
can
not
see
that
the
would
have
suffered
but
now
when
next
in
need
of
my
services
ye
mebbe
send
for
me
he
took
up
his
hat
i
assured
him
and
let
him
take
it
in
what
sense
he
liked
that
i
would
do
so
and
he
left
me
not
for
one
single
moment
did
i
intend
that
they
should
bounce
me
like
that
with
or
without
their
sanction
and
countenance
i
intended
to
write
and
publish
that
life
schofield
in
my
own
house
too
had
had
the
advantage
that
a
poor
and
man
has
over
one
who
is
not
poor
and
but
my
duty
first
of
all
was
neither
to
him
nor
to
maschka
but
to
my
friend
the
worst
of
it
was
however
that
i
had
begun
dimly
to
suspect
that
the
lancastrian
had
hit
at
least
one
nail
on
the
head
your
artistic
soul
only
to
be
saved
by
writing
poor
michael
he
had
informed
me
and
it
was
truer
than
i
found
it
pleasant
to
believe
perhaps
after
all
my
first
duty
was
not
to
andriaovsky
but
to
myself
i
could
have
kicked
myself
that
the
fool
had
been
perspicacious
enough
to
see
it
but
that
did
not
alter
the
fact
i
saw
that
in
the
sense
in
which
andriaovsky
understood
sin
i
had
sinned
my
only
defence
lay
in
the
magnitude
of
my
sin
i
had
sinned
thoroughly
and
with
a
will
it
had
been
the
only
respectable
way
andriaovsky
own
way
when
he
had
cut
the
company
of
an
academician
to
hobnob
with
a
vagabond
i
had
at
least
instituted
no
comparison
lowered
no
ideal
was
innocent
of
the
accursed
attitude
of
that
degrades
all
lovely
and
moving
things
i
was
by
a
paradox
too
black
a
sinner
not
to
hope
for
redemption
i
fell
into
a
long
musing
on
these
things
had
any
of
the
admirers
of
entered
the
library
of
his
author
that
night
he
would
have
seen
an
interesting
thing
he
would
have
seen
the
creator
of
that
idol
of
clerks
and
and
boys
frankly
putting
the
case
before
a
portrait
propped
up
on
a
chair
he
would
have
heard
that
popular
author
haranguing
pleading
curiously
on
his
defence
turning
the
thing
this
way
and
that
if
gone
over
michael
that
author
argued
you
have
done
precisely
the
same
thing
if
i
stuck
it
out
we
were
after
all
of
a
kind
we
got
to
be
one
thing
or
the
other
is
that
so
andriaovsky
since
i
made
up
my
mind
i
faced
only
one
way
only
one
way
i
kept
your
ideal
and
theirs
entirely
separate
and
distinct
not
one
single
beautiful
phrase
will
you
find
in
the
renards
i
cut
out
every
one
i
may
have
ceased
to
worship
but
i
profaned
no
temple
and
think
what
i
have
done
what
they
all
do
they
deal
out
the
slush
but
with
an
apologetic
glance
at
the
art
shades
know
the
style
harrison
he
does
that
detective
rubbish
but
that
not
harrison
if
harrison
liked
to
drop
that
he
could
be
a
fine
artist
i
done
that
i
run
with
the
hare
and
hunted
with
the
hounds
i
just
harrison
who
does
that
detective
rubbish
these
other
chaps
schofield
and
connolly
the
real
sinners
michael
the
fellows
who
ca
make
up
their
minds
to
be
one
thing
or
the
other
of
considerable
abilities
ha
ha
of
course
you
know
maschka
going
to
marry
that
chap
what
do
do
you
think
he
scrape
up
a
few
pounds
out
of
the
stew
where
i
find
thousands
marry
her
and
they
set
up
a
salon
and
talk
the
stuff
the
chairs
talked
that
night
you
remember
but
you
wait
until
i
finish
your
i
laid
it
all
before
him
almost
as
if
i
sought
to
propitiate
him
i
might
have
been
courting
his
patronage
for
his
own
life
then
with
a
start
i
came
to
to
find
myself
talking
nonsense
to
the
portrait
that
years
before
andriaovsky
had
refused
to
sell
me
iv
the
first
check
i
experienced
in
the
hitherto
so
easy
flow
of
the
life
came
at
the
chapter
that
dealt
with
andriaovsky
attitude
towards
professionalism
in
art
he
was
inflexible
on
this
point
there
ought
not
to
be
professional
artists
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
his
position
involved
a
premium
upon
the
rich
amateur
he
merely
replied
that
riches
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
and
that
the
starver
in
the
garret
was
not
excused
for
his
poverty
sake
from
the
observance
of
the
implacable
conditions
he
spoke
literally
of
the
need
to
create
usually
in
the
french
term
and
he
was
inclined
to
regard
the
imposition
of
this
need
on
a
man
rather
as
a
curse
laid
upon
him
than
as
a
privilege
and
a
pleasure
but
i
must
not
enlarge
upon
this
further
than
to
observe
that
this
portion
of
his
life
which
i
was
approaching
coincided
in
point
of
time
with
that
period
of
my
own
life
at
which
i
had
been
confronted
with
the
alternative
of
starving
for
art
sake
or
becoming
rich
by
supplying
a
clamorous
trade
demand
it
came
this
check
i
have
spoken
of
one
night
as
i
was
in
the
very
middle
of
a
sentence
and
though
i
have
cudgelled
my
brains
in
seeking
how
best
i
can
describe
it
i
am
reduced
to
the
simple
statement
that
it
was
as
arresting
as
sharp
actual
and
impossible
to
resist
as
if
my
hand
had
been
seized
and
pinned
down
in
its
passage
across
the
paper
i
can
even
see
again
the
fragment
of
the
sentence
i
had
written
the
mere
contemplation
of
a
betrayal
so
essential
then
came
that
abrupt
and
remarkable
stop
it
was
such
an
experience
as
i
had
formerly
known
only
in
nightmare
i
sat
there
looking
blankly
and
stupidly
at
my
own
hand
and
not
only
was
my
hand
arrested
but
my
brain
also
had
completely
ceased
to
work
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
recall
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
i
had
planned
a
moment
before
i
looked
at
my
hand
and
looked
again
and
as
i
looked
i
remembered
something
i
had
been
reading
only
a
few
days
before
a
profoundly
unsettling
description
of
an
experiment
in
the
experiment
had
consisted
of
the
placing
of
a
hand
upon
a
table
and
the
laying
upon
it
the
conjuration
that
the
will
notwithstanding
it
should
not
move
and
as
i
watched
my
own
hand
pale
on
the
paper
in
the
pearly
light
i
knew
that
by
some
consent
to
the
nullification
of
the
will
that
did
not
proceed
from
the
self
i
was
accustomed
to
regard
as
my
own
that
injunction
was
already
placed
upon
it
my
conscious
and
deliberate
will
was
powerless
i
could
only
sit
there
and
wait
until
whatever
inhibition
had
arrested
my
writing
hand
should
permit
it
to
move
forward
again
it
must
have
been
several
minutes
before
such
a
tingling
of
the
nerves
as
announces
that
the
blood
is
once
more
returning
to
a
cramped
member
warned
me
that
i
was
about
to
be
released
warily
i
awaited
my
moment
then
i
plucked
my
hand
to
myself
again
with
a
suddenness
that
caused
a
little
blot
of
ink
to
spurt
from
my
on
to
the
surface
of
the
paper
i
drew
a
deep
breath
i
was
free
again
and
with
the
freedom
came
a
resolve
that
whatever
portion
of
myself
had
been
responsible
for
this
prank
should
not
repeat
it
if
i
could
possibly
prevent
it
but
scarcely
had
i
come
as
i
may
say
and
not
without
a
little
gush
of
alarm
now
that
it
was
over
to
myself
when
i
was
struck
by
a
thought
it
was
a
queer
wild
sort
of
thought
it
fetched
me
out
of
my
chair
and
set
me
striding
across
the
library
to
a
lower
shelf
in
the
farthest
corner
this
shelf
was
the
shelf
on
which
i
kept
my
i
stooped
and
ran
my
fingers
along
the
backs
of
the
dusty
row
i
drew
out
the
file
for
and
brought
it
back
to
my
my
contracts
i
ought
to
say
reposed
in
a
at
my
agent
office
but
my
files
contained
in
the
form
of
my
agent
letters
a
sufficient
record
of
my
business
transactions
i
opened
the
file
and
turned
to
the
section
lettered
i
drew
out
the
correspondence
that
related
to
the
sale
of
the
first
series
of
the
as
i
did
so
i
glanced
at
the
movable
calendar
on
my
table
the
date
was
january
the
file
contained
no
letters
for
january
of
any
significance
whatever
the
thought
that
had
half
formed
in
my
brain
immediately
became
nonsense
i
replaced
the
letters
in
their
compartment
and
took
the
file
back
to
its
shelf
again
for
some
minutes
i
paced
the
library
irresolutely
then
i
decided
i
would
work
no
more
that
night
when
i
gathered
together
my
papers
i
was
careful
to
place
that
with
the
sentence
on
the
top
so
that
with
the
first
resting
of
my
eyes
upon
it
on
the
morrow
my
memory
might
haply
be
refreshed
i
tried
again
to
finish
that
sentence
on
the
morrow
with
certain
modifications
that
i
need
not
particularise
here
my
experience
was
the
same
as
on
the
previous
night
it
was
the
same
when
i
made
the
attempt
on
the
day
after
that
at
ten
of
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
i
completed
the
sentence
without
difficulty
i
just
sat
down
in
my
chair
and
wrote
it
with
equal
ease
i
finished
the
chapter
on
professional
artists
it
was
not
likely
that
schofield
would
have
refrained
from
telling
maschka
of
our
little
difference
on
our
last
meeting
and
within
a
week
of
the
date
i
have
just
mentioned
i
learned
that
she
knew
all
about
it
and
as
the
circumstances
of
my
learning
this
were
in
a
high
degree
unusual
i
will
relate
them
with
such
clearness
as
i
am
able
i
ought
first
to
say
however
that
the
selection
of
the
drawings
that
were
to
illustrate
the
book
having
been
made
the
drawings
for
which
my
own
text
was
to
serve
as
commentary
would
be
the
better
expression
the
superintendence
of
their
production
had
been
left
to
schofield
he
maschka
and
i
passed
the
proofs
in
consultation
the
blocks
were
almost
ready
and
the
reason
for
their
call
that
evening
was
to
consider
the
possibility
of
having
all
ready
for
production
in
the
early
spring
a
possibility
which
was
contingent
on
the
state
of
advancement
of
my
own
share
of
the
book
that
evening
i
had
experienced
my
second
check
i
omit
those
that
had
immediately
succeeded
the
first
one
as
resembling
that
one
so
closely
in
the
manner
of
their
coming
it
had
not
come
by
any
means
so
completely
and
definitively
as
the
former
one
but
it
had
sufficed
to
make
my
progress
both
mentally
and
mechanically
so
sluggish
and
struggling
a
performance
that
for
the
time
being
i
had
given
up
the
attempt
and
was
once
more
regarding
with
a
sort
of
perturbed
stupor
my
hand
that
held
the
pen
andriaovsky
portrait
stood
in
its
usual
place
on
the
chair
at
the
end
of
my
but
i
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
that
refractory
hand
of
mine
now
it
is
true
that
during
the
past
weeks
i
had
studied
portrait
thoroughly
enough
to
be
able
to
call
up
the
vivid
mental
image
of
it
at
will
but
that
did
not
entirely
account
for
the
changed
aspect
with
which
it
now
presented
itself
to
that
uncomprehended
sense
within
us
that
makes
of
these
shadows
such
startling
realities
flashing
and
as
was
the
presentation
on
the
canvas
mind
you
i
was
not
looking
at
it
but
all
the
time
at
my
own
hand
it
was
dead
paint
by
comparison
with
that
which
i
saw
if
i
may
so
use
a
term
of
which
custom
has
restricted
the
meaning
to
one
kind
of
seeing
as
plainly
as
i
ever
saw
andriaovsky
in
his
life
i
know
now
that
it
was
by
virtue
of
that
essential
essence
that
bound
us
heart
and
brain
and
soul
together
that
i
so
saw
him
eyes
glittering
head
sardonically
wagging
fine
mouth
shaping
phrases
of
insight
and
irony
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
i
could
not
have
located
this
so
living
image
by
confining
it
to
any
portion
of
the
space
within
the
four
walls
of
my
library
it
was
before
me
behind
me
within
my
head
about
me
invading
and
possessing
the
me
that
sat
at
the
table
at
one
moment
the
eyes
mockingly
invited
me
to
go
on
with
my
work
the
next
a
frown
had
seated
itself
on
that
massive
pylon
of
his
forehead
and
then
suddenly
his
countenance
changed
entirely
a
wave
of
horror
broke
over
me
he
was
suddenly
as
i
had
seen
him
that
last
time
in
the
hampstead
home
sitting
up
on
his
pillow
looking
into
my
eyes
with
that
terrible
look
of
profundity
and
familiarity
and
asking
me
who
i
was
harrison
ha
ha
you
shall
very
soon
know
that
i
know
you
if
it
is
but
by
the
accidence
of
our
limited
experience
that
sounds
are
loud
or
soft
to
that
inner
ear
of
us
these
words
were
at
one
and
the
same
time
a
dreadful
thunder
and
a
voice
interstellarly
inaccessible
and
withdrawn
they
too
were
before
behind
without
and
within
and
incorporated
i
know
not
how
else
to
express
it
with
these
words
were
other
words
in
the
english
i
knew
in
the
hebrew
in
which
he
had
quoted
them
from
the
sacred
books
of
his
people
in
all
languages
in
no
language
save
that
essential
communication
of
which
languages
are
but
the
inessential
husk
and
medium
words
that
told
me
that
though
i
took
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
fled
into
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
yea
though
i
made
my
bed
in
hell
i
could
not
escape
him
he
had
kept
his
word
i
know
that
he
knew
who
and
what
i
was
i
can
not
tell
whether
my
lips
actually
shaped
the
question
that
even
in
that
moment
burst
from
me
but
form
and
forms
it
then
true
that
all
things
are
but
aspects
of
one
thing
yes
in
death
the
voice
seemed
to
reply
my
next
words
i
know
were
actually
spoken
aloud
then
tell
me
tell
me
you
not
wish
me
to
write
it
suddenly
i
leapt
out
of
my
chair
with
a
gulping
cry
a
voice
spoken
of
course
we
wish
you
to
write
it
for
one
instant
of
time
my
vision
seemed
to
fold
on
itself
like
smoke
then
it
was
gone
the
face
into
which
i
was
wildly
staring
was
maschka
and
behind
her
stood
schofield
they
had
been
announced
but
i
had
heard
nothing
of
it
were
you
thinking
of
writing
it
she
demanded
while
schofield
scowled
at
me
no
no
i
stammered
as
i
got
up
and
tardily
placed
them
chairs
schofield
did
not
speak
but
he
did
not
remove
his
eyes
from
me
somehow
i
could
not
meet
them
well
she
said
jack
had
already
told
me
that
you
seemed
in
two
minds
about
it
that
what
we
called
about
to
know
definitely
what
it
is
you
propose
to
do
i
saw
that
she
had
also
called
if
necessary
to
quarrel
i
began
to
recover
a
little
did
you
tell
her
that
i
demanded
of
schofield
if
you
did
you
misinterpreted
me
in
my
house
he
ignored
the
fact
that
i
was
in
the
room
he
replied
to
maschka
i
understood
harrison
to
say
definitely
and
in
those
words
that
if
i
did
like
the
way
in
which
he
was
writing
michael
i
might
write
and
publish
one
myself
he
said
i
did
say
that
i
admitted
but
i
never
said
that
whatever
did
i
should
not
go
on
with
mine
yours
cried
maschka
what
right
have
in
my
brother
i
quickly
told
her
i
have
the
right
to
write
my
recollections
of
him
and
subject
to
certain
provisions
of
the
law
to
base
anything
on
them
i
think
fit
i
replied
but
she
cried
aghast
there
ca
be
it
news
to
me
that
two
were
contemplated
i
returned
the
point
is
that
i
can
get
mine
published
and
you
ca
schofield
harsh
voice
sounded
suddenly
but
again
to
maschka
not
to
me
ye
might
remind
harrison
that
others
have
capabilities
in
business
besides
himself
beyond
a
doubt
our
sales
will
be
comparatively
small
but
they
be
to
such
as
have
not
made
the
great
refusal
think
of
it
i
almost
laughed
oh
been
trying
it
i
inquired
he
made
no
reply
well
those
who
have
made
the
refusal
have
at
least
had
something
to
refuse
i
said
mildly
then
realising
that
this
was
mere
quarrelling
i
returned
to
the
point
anyhow
there
no
question
of
refusing
to
write
the
i
admit
that
during
the
last
fortnight
i
met
with
certain
difficulties
but
the
task
is
so
easy
as
perhaps
it
looks
making
progress
i
suppose
she
said
hesitatingly
after
a
pause
that
you
do
care
to
show
it
as
far
as
it
is
written
for
a
moment
i
also
hesitated
i
thought
i
saw
where
she
was
thanks
to
that
lancashire
jackanapes
there
was
division
between
us
and
i
had
pretty
well
made
up
my
mind
not
only
that
he
thought
himself
quite
capable
of
writing
andriaovsky
life
himself
but
that
he
had
actually
made
an
attempt
in
that
direction
they
had
come
in
the
suspicion
that
i
was
throwing
them
over
and
though
that
suspicion
was
removed
maschka
wished
if
there
was
any
throwing
over
to
be
done
to
do
it
herself
in
a
word
she
wanted
to
compare
me
with
schofield
to
see
it
as
far
as
it
is
written
i
repeated
slowly
well
you
may
that
is
you
michael
sister
may
but
on
the
condition
that
you
neither
show
it
to
anybody
else
nor
speak
of
it
to
anybody
else
ah
she
said
and
only
on
those
conditions
only
on
those
conditions
i
saw
a
quick
glance
between
them
shall
we
tell
him
it
seemed
to
say
including
the
man
michael
sister
is
going
to
marry
she
said
abruptly
my
attitude
was
deeply
apologetic
but
including
anybody
whomsoever
i
answered
then
she
said
rising
we
wo
bother
but
will
you
at
least
let
us
know
soon
when
we
may
expect
your
text
i
will
let
you
know
i
replied
slowly
one
week
from
on
that
assurance
they
left
and
when
they
had
gone
i
crossed
once
more
to
the
lower
shelf
that
contained
my
i
turned
up
the
file
for
once
more
during
their
visit
i
had
had
an
idea
i
ran
through
the
letters
and
then
replaced
them
yes
i
ought
to
be
able
to
let
them
know
within
the
week
v
against
the
day
when
i
myself
shall
come
to
die
there
are
in
the
of
the
newspaper
libraries
certain
biographical
records
that
deal
roughly
with
the
outward
facts
of
my
life
and
these
supplemented
by
documents
i
shall
place
in
the
hands
of
my
executors
will
tell
the
story
of
how
i
leaped
at
a
bound
into
wealth
and
fame
with
the
publication
of
cases
of
martin
i
will
set
down
as
much
of
that
story
as
has
its
bearing
on
my
present
tale
was
not
immediately
accepted
by
the
first
editor
to
whom
it
was
offered
it
does
not
suffice
that
in
order
to
be
popular
a
thing
shall
be
merely
good
or
bad
it
must
be
bad
or
good
in
a
particular
way
for
taking
the
responsibility
when
they
happen
to
miss
that
particular
way
editors
are
paid
their
salaries
when
they
happen
to
hit
it
they
grow
fat
on
since
it
becomes
me
ill
to
quarrel
with
the
way
in
which
any
man
earns
his
money
i
content
myself
with
merely
stating
the
fact
by
the
time
the
fourth
editor
had
refused
my
series
i
was
about
at
my
last
gasp
to
write
the
things
at
all
i
had
had
to
sink
four
months
in
time
and
debts
writs
and
pawnshops
were
my
familiars
i
was
little
better
off
than
andriaovsky
at
his
very
worst
i
had
read
the
first
of
the
to
him
by
the
way
the
gigantic
outburst
of
mirth
with
which
he
had
received
it
had
not
encouraged
me
to
read
him
a
second
i
wrote
the
others
in
secret
i
wrote
the
things
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
and
by
the
last
day
of
september
i
was
confident
that
i
had
at
last
sold
them
except
by
a
flagrant
breach
of
faith
the
editor
in
whose
desk
they
reposed
could
hardly
decline
them
as
it
subsequently
happened
i
have
now
nothing
but
gratitude
for
him
that
he
did
after
all
decline
them
for
i
had
a
duplicate
copy
on
offer
in
another
quarter
he
declined
them
i
say
and
i
was
free
to
possess
my
soul
again
among
my
writs
debts
and
pawnshops
but
four
days
later
i
received
the
alternative
offer
it
was
from
the
the
as
you
may
remember
has
since
run
no
less
than
five
complete
series
of
it
bought
both
sides
that
is
to
say
both
british
and
american
serial
rights
of
the
twelve
i
had
written
my
wise
agent
had
offered
the
six
only
on
his
advice
i
accepted
the
offer
instantaneously
with
the
publication
of
those
six
stories
came
my
success
in
two
continents
i
was
home
home
in
the
hearts
of
the
public
i
had
my
small
cheque
it
was
not
much
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
but
wait
said
my
agent
let
see
what
we
can
do
with
the
other
six
precisely
what
he
did
with
them
only
he
and
i
know
but
i
do
mind
saying
that
did
not
buy
my
first
serial
rights
then
came
second
and
third
rights
and
after
them
the
book
rights
british
american
and
colonial
then
came
the
translation
rights
in
french
my
creation
is
of
course
as
in
english
in
german
he
is
martin
fuchs
and
by
a
similar
process
you
can
put
him
my
translators
have
put
him
into
italian
swedish
norwegian
russian
and
of
the
tongues
of
europe
and
this
was
the
first
series
only
it
was
only
with
the
second
series
that
the
full
splendour
of
my
success
appeared
my
very
imitators
grew
rich
my
agent
income
from
his
comparatively
small
percentage
on
my
royalties
was
handsome
and
he
chuckled
and
bade
me
wait
for
the
dramatic
rights
and
the
day
when
the
touring
companies
should
get
to
business
i
had
got
there
and
i
remember
sadly
enough
now
my
first
resolution
when
the
day
came
when
i
was
able
to
survey
the
situation
with
anything
approaching
calm
it
was
enough
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
need
not
know
poverty
again
thenceforward
i
need
not
unless
i
chose
do
any
but
worthy
work
had
served
his
purpose
handsomely
and
i
intended
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
then
came
that
dazzling
offer
for
the
second
series
i
accepted
it
i
accepted
the
third
likewise
and
i
have
told
you
about
the
fourth
i
have
tried
to
kill
he
was
killing
me
i
have
in
the
pages
of
the
actually
killed
him
but
i
have
had
to
resuscitate
him
i
can
not
escape
from
him
i
am
not
setting
down
one
word
more
of
this
than
bears
directly
on
my
tale
of
andriaovsky
life
for
those
days
when
my
whole
future
had
hung
in
the
balance
the
very
days
covered
by
that
portion
of
andriaovsky
life
at
which
i
had
now
i
had
reached
and
was
hesitating
at
our
point
of
divergence
those
checks
and
releases
which
i
had
at
first
found
so
unaccountable
corresponded
with
the
vicissitudes
of
the
negotiations
the
actual
dates
did
not
of
course
coincide
i
had
quickly
discovered
the
falsity
of
that
scent
neither
did
the
intervals
between
them
with
the
exception
of
those
few
days
in
which
i
had
been
unable
to
complete
that
sentence
the
few
days
immediately
prior
to
my
parallel
acceptance
by
the
but
by
that
other
reckoning
of
time
of
mental
and
spiritual
experience
tallied
the
gambling
chances
of
five
years
ago
meant
present
stumblings
and
haltings
the
breach
of
faith
of
an
editor
long
since
meant
a
present
respite
and
another
week
should
bring
me
to
that
point
of
my
so
strangely
reduplicated
experience
that
allowing
for
the
furious
mental
rate
at
which
i
was
now
living
would
make
another
node
with
that
other
point
in
the
more
slowly
lived
past
that
had
marked
my
acceptance
of
the
offer
for
the
second
of
the
it
had
been
on
this
hazardous
calculation
that
i
had
made
my
promise
to
maschka
i
passed
that
week
in
a
state
of
constantly
increasing
apprehension
true
i
worked
at
the
life
even
assiduously
but
it
was
plain
sailing
mere
cataloguing
of
certain
of
andriaovsky
works
a
chapter
i
had
deliberately
planned
mieux
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
penultimate
and
final
chapters
these
were
the
real
crux
of
the
life
these
were
what
i
was
reserving
myself
for
these
were
to
show
that
only
his
body
was
dead
and
that
his
spirit
still
lived
and
his
work
was
still
being
done
wherever
a
man
could
be
found
whose
soul
burned
within
him
with
the
same
divine
ardour
but
i
was
now
realising
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
more
clearly
what
i
was
incurring
i
was
penning
nothing
less
than
my
own
artistic
damnation
indeed
i
had
been
this
long
time
but
i
was
now
making
the
world
a
party
to
the
sentence
the
crowning
of
andriaovsky
involved
my
own
annihilation
his
life
would
be
my
hic
jacet
and
yet
i
was
prepared
nay
resolved
to
write
it
i
had
started
and
i
would
go
forward
i
would
not
be
spewed
with
the
lukewarm
out
of
the
mouth
of
that
spirit
from
which
proceeds
all
that
is
bright
and
pure
and
true
the
vehemence
with
which
i
had
rejected
its
divine
bidding
should
at
least
be
correspondent
with
my
adoration
of
it
the
snivelling
claims
of
the
schofields
i
spurned
if
as
they
urged
an
artist
must
live
he
must
live
royally
or
starve
with
a
tight
mouth
no
complaining
and
one
other
claim
i
urged
in
the
teeth
of
this
spirit
which
if
it
was
a
human
spirit
at
all
it
could
not
disregard
those
obituaries
of
mine
will
proclaim
to
the
world
one
and
all
the
virtues
of
my
public
life
in
spite
of
my
royal
earnings
i
am
not
a
rich
man
i
have
not
accepted
wealth
without
accepting
the
personal
responsibility
for
it
sick
men
and
women
in
more
than
one
hospital
lie
in
wards
provided
by
and
myself
and
i
am
not
dishonoured
in
my
institution
at
poplar
those
vagrant
wanderings
with
andriaovsky
have
enabled
me
to
know
the
poor
and
those
who
help
the
poor
my
personal
labours
in
the
administration
of
the
institute
are
great
for
outside
the
necessary
routine
i
leave
little
to
subordinates
i
have
declined
honours
offered
to
me
for
my
services
to
literature
and
i
have
never
encouraged
a
youth
of
parts
or
lacking
them
to
make
of
literature
a
profession
and
so
on
and
so
forth
all
this
and
more
you
will
read
when
the
day
comes
and
i
do
doubt
the
will
publish
my
memoir
in
mourning
borders
but
to
resume
i
finished
the
chapter
i
have
mentioned
maschka
and
her
fiancé
kept
punctiliously
away
then
before
sitting
down
to
the
penultimate
chapter
i
permitted
myself
the
relaxation
of
a
day
in
the
country
i
ca
tell
you
precisely
where
i
went
i
only
know
it
was
somewhere
in
buckinghamshire
and
that
ordering
the
car
to
await
me
a
dozen
miles
farther
on
i
set
out
to
walk
nor
can
i
tell
you
what
i
saw
during
that
walk
i
do
think
i
saw
anything
there
was
a
red
wintry
disc
of
a
sun
i
remember
and
a
land
grey
with
rime
and
that
is
all
i
was
entirely
occupied
with
the
attempt
i
was
about
to
make
i
think
that
even
then
i
had
the
sense
of
doom
for
i
know
not
how
otherwise
i
should
have
found
myself
several
times
making
little
husbandings
of
my
force
as
if
conscious
that
i
should
need
it
all
for
i
was
determined
as
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
determined
to
write
that
life
and
i
intended
not
to
wait
to
be
challenged
but
to
challenge
i
met
the
car
returning
in
search
of
me
and
i
dined
at
a
restaurant
went
home
to
bed
and
slept
dreamlessly
on
the
morrow
i
deliberately
refrained
from
work
until
the
evening
my
challenge
to
andriaovsky
and
the
powers
he
represented
should
be
boldly
delivered
at
the
very
gates
of
their
own
hour
not
until
eight
with
the
curtains
drawn
the
doors
locked
and
orders
given
that
on
no
account
whatever
was
i
to
be
disturbed
did
i
switch
on
the
pearly
light
place
andriaovsky
portrait
in
its
now
accustomed
place
and
draw
my
chair
up
to
my
vi
but
before
i
could
resume
the
life
at
the
point
at
which
i
had
left
it
i
felt
that
there
were
certain
preliminaries
to
be
settled
it
was
not
that
i
wished
to
sound
a
parley
with
any
view
of
coming
to
terms
i
had
determined
what
the
terms
were
to
be
as
a
boxer
who
leaps
from
his
corner
the
moment
the
signal
is
given
astounding
with
suddenness
his
less
prompt
antagonist
so
i
should
be
ready
when
the
moment
came
but
i
wished
the
issue
to
be
defined
i
did
not
propose
to
submit
the
whole
of
my
manhood
to
the
trial
i
was
merely
asserting
my
right
to
speak
of
certain
things
which
if
one
chose
to
exaggerate
their
importance
by
a
too
narrow
and
exclusive
consideration
of
them
i
might
conceivably
be
thought
to
have
betrayed
i
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
me
and
formally
made
out
my
claim
it
occupied
not
more
than
a
dozen
lines
and
its
nature
has
already
been
sufficiently
indicated
i
put
my
pen
down
again
leaned
back
in
my
chair
and
waited
i
waited
but
nothing
happened
it
seemed
that
if
this
was
my
attempt
to
justify
myself
the
plea
was
certainly
not
disallowed
but
neither
had
i
any
sign
that
it
was
allowed
and
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
possibly
i
had
couched
it
in
terms
too
general
perhaps
a
more
particular
claim
would
meet
with
a
different
reception
during
the
earlier
stages
of
the
book
progress
i
had
many
times
deliberated
on
the
desirability
of
a
preface
that
should
state
succinctly
what
i
considered
to
be
my
qualifications
for
the
task
though
i
had
finally
decided
against
any
such
statement
the
form
of
the
preface
might
nevertheless
serve
for
the
present
occasion
i
took
another
sheet
of
paper
headed
it
preface
and
began
once
more
to
write
i
covered
the
page
i
covered
a
second
and
down
the
third
i
judged
my
statement
to
be
sufficient
again
i
laid
down
my
pen
leaned
back
and
waited
the
preface
also
produced
no
result
whatever
again
i
considered
and
then
i
saw
more
clearly
it
came
to
me
that
both
in
the
first
statement
and
in
the
preface
i
was
merely
talking
to
myself
i
was
convincing
myself
and
losing
both
time
and
strength
in
doing
so
the
power
with
which
i
sought
to
come
to
grips
was
treating
my
vapourings
with
high
disregard
to
be
snubbed
thus
by
headquarters
would
never
never
do
then
i
saw
more
clearly
still
it
seemed
that
my
to
was
denied
i
was
not
an
adversary
with
the
rights
and
honours
of
an
adversary
but
a
trangressor
whose
trangression
had
already
several
times
been
sharply
visited
and
would
be
visited
once
more
the
moment
it
was
repeated
i
might
in
a
sense
please
myself
whether
i
brought
myself
into
court
but
once
there
i
was
not
the
arraigner
in
the
box
but
the
arraigned
in
the
dock
and
i
rebelled
hotly
did
i
sit
there
ready
for
the
struggle
only
to
be
told
that
there
could
be
no
struggle
did
that
vengeful
angel
of
the
arts
ignore
my
very
existence
by
yea
and
nay
i
swore
that
he
should
take
notice
of
me
once
before
a
mortal
had
wrestled
a
whole
night
with
an
angel
and
though
he
had
been
worsted
it
had
not
been
before
he
had
compelled
the
angel
to
reveal
himself
and
so
would
i
challenge
title
to
challenge
tentatives
preliminaries
i
suddenly
cast
them
all
aside
we
would
have
it
in
deeds
not
in
further
words
i
opened
a
drawer
took
out
the
whole
of
the
life
so
far
written
and
began
to
read
i
wanted
to
grasp
once
more
the
plan
of
it
in
its
entirety
page
after
page
i
read
on
with
deepening
attention
quickly
i
ran
through
half
of
it
then
i
began
to
concentrate
myself
still
more
closely
there
would
come
a
point
at
which
i
should
be
flush
with
the
stream
of
it
again
again
feel
the
force
of
its
current
i
felt
myself
drawing
nearer
to
that
point
when
i
should
reach
it
i
would
go
ahead
without
a
pause
i
read
to
the
end
of
chapter
fifteen
the
last
completed
chapter
then
instantly
i
took
my
pen
and
wrote
chapter
sixteen
i
felt
the
change
at
the
very
first
word
i
will
not
retraverse
any
ground
i
have
covered
before
if
i
have
not
already
made
clear
my
former
sensations
of
the
petrefaction
of
hand
and
brain
i
despair
of
being
able
to
do
so
any
better
now
suffice
it
that
once
more
i
felt
that
inhibition
and
that
once
more
i
was
aware
of
the
ubiquitous
presence
of
the
image
of
the
dead
artist
once
more
i
heard
those
voices
near
as
thunder
and
yet
interstellarly
remote
crying
that
solemn
warning
that
though
i
took
the
wings
of
the
morning
made
my
bed
in
hell
or
cried
aloud
upon
the
darkness
to
cover
me
there
was
one
spirit
from
which
i
could
not
hope
to
escape
i
felt
the
slight
crawling
of
my
flesh
on
my
bones
as
i
listened
but
there
was
now
a
difference
on
the
former
occasion
to
hear
again
those
last
horrible
words
of
his
shall
very
soon
know
i
know
who
you
are
had
been
the
signal
for
the
total
unnerving
of
me
and
for
that
uncontrollable
cry
you
then
want
me
to
write
but
now
i
intended
to
write
it
if
i
could
in
order
that
i
might
tell
him
so
i
was
now
seeking
him
out
in
what
heights
or
depths
i
knew
not
at
what
peril
to
myself
i
cared
not
i
cared
not
since
i
now
felt
that
i
could
not
continue
to
live
unless
i
pressed
to
the
uttermost
attempt
and
i
must
repeat
and
repeat
again
and
yet
repeat
that
in
that
hour
andriaovsky
was
immanent
about
me
in
the
whole
of
me
in
the
last
fibre
and
cell
of
me
in
all
my
thoughts
from
my
consciousness
that
i
was
sitting
there
at
my
own
to
my
conception
of
god
himself
it
may
seem
strange
whether
it
does
so
or
not
will
depend
on
the
kind
of
man
you
yourself
are
that
as
long
as
i
was
content
to
recognise
this
immanence
of
andriaovsky
enlarged
and
liberated
spirit
not
to
dispute
with
i
found
nothing
but
mildness
and
benignity
in
my
hazardous
experience
more
i
felt
that
in
that
clear
region
to
which
in
my
intensified
state
of
consciousness
i
was
lifted
i
was
able
to
move
i
must
trust
you
to
understand
the
word
aright
without
restraint
nay
with
an
amplitude
and
freedom
of
movement
past
setting
down
as
long
as
i
was
satisfied
to
possess
my
soul
in
quiescence
the
state
itself
was
inimical
neither
to
my
safety
nor
to
my
sanity
i
was
conscious
of
it
as
a
transposition
into
another
register
of
the
scale
of
life
and
as
in
this
life
we
move
in
ignorance
and
safety
only
by
accepting
the
of
stupendous
forces
so
now
i
felt
that
my
safety
depended
on
my
observation
of
the
conditions
that
governed
that
region
of
light
and
clarity
and
law
of
clarity
and
law
save
in
the
terms
of
the
great
abstractions
i
may
not
speak
of
it
and
that
is
equal
to
saying
that
i
may
not
speak
of
it
at
all
the
hand
that
would
have
written
of
it
lay
i
never
for
one
moment
ceased
to
be
conscious
heavy
as
stone
on
a
in
some
spot
quite
accidental
in
my
new
sense
of
locality
the
tongue
that
would
have
spoken
of
it
seemed
to
slumber
in
my
mouth
and
i
knew
that
both
dumbness
and
stillness
were
proper
their
opposites
would
have
convicted
me
the
flat
and
earthly
comparison
must
be
allowed
of
intrusion
into
some
place
of
beauty
and
serenity
for
which
the
soilure
of
my
birth
disqualified
me
for
beauty
and
serenity
austerity
and
benignity
and
peace
were
the
conditions
of
that
place
to
other
places
belonged
the
wingy
and
robed
and
starry
and
golden
things
that
made
the
heavens
of
other
lives
than
that
which
i
had
shared
with
andriaovsky
here
white
and
shapely
truth
alone
reigned
none
questioned
for
all
knew
none
sinned
for
sin
was
already
judged
and
punished
in
its
committal
none
demonstrated
for
all
things
were
evident
and
those
eager
to
justify
themselves
were
permitted
no
farther
than
the
threshold
and
it
was
to
justify
to
challenge
to
maintain
a
right
that
i
was
there
i
was
there
to
wrestle
if
needs
be
with
the
angel
of
that
place
to
vanquish
him
or
to
compel
him
to
reveal
himself
i
had
not
been
summoned
i
had
thrust
myself
there
unbidden
there
was
a
moment
in
which
i
noticed
that
my
was
a
little
more
than
ordinarily
removed
from
me
but
very
little
not
more
than
if
i
had
been
looking
over
the
shoulder
of
another
writer
at
it
and
i
saw
my
chapter
heading
at
the
sight
of
it
something
of
the
egotism
that
had
prompted
me
to
write
it
stirred
in
me
again
everywhere
was
andriaovsky
calm
face
priest
and
angel
himself
and
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
trying
to
write
a
phrase
i
also
became
conscious
that
i
was
being
pitifully
warned
not
to
do
so
suddenly
my
whole
being
was
flooded
with
a
frightful
pang
of
pain
it
was
not
local
it
was
no
more
to
be
located
than
the
other
immanences
of
which
i
have
spoken
it
was
pain
pure
essential
dissociated
and
with
the
coming
of
it
that
fair
place
had
grown
suddenly
horrible
and
black
and
i
knew
that
the
shock
came
my
own
and
that
it
would
cease
to
afflict
me
the
moment
i
ceased
to
resist
i
did
cease
instantly
the
pain
passed
but
as
when
a
knife
is
plucked
from
a
wound
so
only
with
its
passing
did
i
shriek
aloud
for
i
know
not
how
many
minutes
i
sat
in
stupefaction
then
as
with
earthly
pains
that
are
assuaged
with
the
passing
of
accidental
time
the
memory
of
it
softened
a
little
blunderingly
and
only
half
consciously
i
cast
about
to
collect
my
dispersed
force
for
already
i
was
conscious
of
it
there
still
remained
one
claim
that
even
in
thought
i
had
not
advanced
i
would
were
i
permitted
still
write
that
life
but
since
it
was
decreed
so
i
would
no
longer
urge
that
in
writing
it
i
justified
myself
so
i
might
but
write
it
i
would
embrace
my
own
portion
the
portion
of
doom
yea
though
it
should
be
a
pressing
of
the
to
my
lips
i
would
embrace
it
my
name
should
not
appear
for
the
mere
sake
of
the
man
i
had
loved
i
would
write
it
in
and
abasement
humbly
craving
not
to
be
denied
oh
let
me
but
do
for
love
of
you
what
a
sinful
man
can
i
groaned
a
moment
later
i
had
again
striven
to
do
so
so
do
we
all
when
we
think
that
out
of
a
poor
human
love
we
can
alter
the
laws
by
which
our
state
exists
and
with
such
a
hideous
anguish
as
was
again
mine
are
we
visited
and
i
knew
now
what
that
anguish
was
it
was
the
twining
of
body
from
spirit
that
is
called
the
bitterness
of
death
for
not
all
of
the
body
are
the
pangs
of
that
severance
with
that
terrible
sword
of
impersonal
pain
the
god
of
peace
makes
sorrowful
war
that
peace
may
come
again
with
its
flame
he
ringed
the
bastions
of
heaven
when
satan
made
assault
only
on
the
of
that
pain
in
the
shield
may
weak
man
look
and
its
blaze
and
ire
had
permeated
with
deadly
nearness
the
everywhere
where
i
was
not
for
love
not
even
for
love
broke
the
agonised
question
from
me
the
next
moment
i
had
ceased
and
ceased
for
ever
to
resist
instantaneously
the
terrible
flashing
of
that
sword
became
no
more
than
the
play
of
lightning
one
sees
far
away
in
the
wide
cloudfields
on
a
peaceful
summer
twilight
i
felt
a
gentle
and
overpowering
sleep
coming
over
me
and
as
it
folded
me
about
i
saw
with
the
last
look
of
my
eyes
my
own
figure
busily
writing
at
the
table
had
i
then
prevailed
had
pain
so
purged
me
that
i
was
permitted
to
finish
my
task
and
had
my
tortured
cry
oh
not
even
for
love
been
heard
i
did
not
know
i
came
to
myself
to
find
that
my
head
had
fallen
on
my
desk
the
light
still
shone
within
its
pearly
shade
and
in
the
penumbra
of
its
shadow
the
portrait
of
andriaovsky
occupied
its
accustomed
place
about
me
were
my
papers
and
my
pen
lay
where
it
had
fallen
from
my
hand
at
first
i
did
not
look
at
my
papers
i
merely
saw
that
the
uppermost
of
them
was
written
on
but
presently
i
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
stupidly
then
with
no
memory
at
all
of
how
i
had
come
to
write
what
was
upon
it
i
put
it
down
again
it
was
indeed
a
completion
but
it
was
not
of
andriaovsky
life
that
it
was
the
completion
as
you
may
or
may
not
know
andriaovsky
life
is
written
by
his
friend
john
schofield
i
had
been
allowed
to
write
but
it
was
my
own
condemnation
that
in
sadness
and
obedience
in
the
absence
of
wrath
but
also
in
the
absence
of
mercy
i
had
written
by
the
law
i
had
broken
i
was
broken
in
my
turn
it
was
the
draft
for
the
fifth
series
of
cases
of
martin
no
not
for
love
not
even
for
love
