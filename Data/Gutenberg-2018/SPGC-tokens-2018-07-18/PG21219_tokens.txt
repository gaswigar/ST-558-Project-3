chapter
i
with
a
lurch
the
train
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
margaret
earle
hastily
gathering
up
her
belongings
hurried
down
the
aisle
and
got
out
into
the
night
it
occurred
to
her
as
she
swung
her
heavy
down
the
rather
long
step
to
the
ground
and
then
carefully
swung
herself
after
it
that
it
was
strange
that
neither
conductor
brakeman
nor
porter
had
come
to
help
her
off
the
train
when
all
three
had
taken
the
trouble
to
tell
her
that
hers
was
the
next
station
but
she
could
hear
voices
up
ahead
perhaps
something
was
the
matter
with
the
engine
that
detained
them
and
they
had
forgotten
her
for
the
moment
the
ground
was
rough
where
she
stood
and
there
seemed
no
sign
of
a
platform
did
they
not
have
platforms
in
this
wild
western
land
or
was
the
train
so
long
that
her
car
had
stopped
before
reaching
it
she
strained
her
eyes
into
the
darkness
and
tried
to
make
out
things
from
the
two
or
three
specks
of
light
that
danced
about
like
fireflies
in
the
distance
she
could
dimly
see
moving
figures
away
up
near
the
engine
and
each
one
evidently
carried
a
lantern
the
train
was
tremendously
long
a
sudden
feeling
of
isolation
took
possession
of
her
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
have
got
out
until
some
one
came
to
help
her
perhaps
the
train
had
not
pulled
into
the
station
yet
and
she
ought
to
get
back
on
it
and
wait
yet
if
the
train
started
before
she
found
the
conductor
she
might
be
carried
on
somewhere
and
be
justly
blame
her
for
a
fool
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
building
on
that
side
of
the
track
it
was
probably
on
the
other
but
she
was
standing
too
near
the
cars
to
see
over
she
tried
to
move
back
to
look
but
the
ground
sloped
and
she
slipped
and
fell
in
the
cinders
bruising
her
knee
and
cutting
her
wrist
in
sudden
panic
she
arose
she
would
get
back
into
the
train
no
matter
what
the
consequences
they
had
no
right
to
put
her
out
here
away
off
from
the
station
at
night
in
a
strange
country
if
the
train
started
before
she
could
find
the
conductor
she
would
tell
him
that
he
must
back
it
up
again
and
let
her
off
he
certainly
could
not
expect
her
to
get
out
like
this
she
lifted
the
heavy
up
the
high
step
that
was
even
farther
from
the
ground
than
it
had
been
when
she
came
down
because
her
fall
had
loosened
some
of
the
earth
and
caused
it
to
slide
away
from
the
track
then
reaching
to
the
rail
of
the
step
she
tried
to
pull
herself
up
but
as
she
did
so
the
engine
gave
a
long
snort
and
the
whole
train
as
if
it
were
in
league
against
her
lurched
forward
crazily
shaking
off
her
hold
she
slipped
to
her
knees
again
the
toppled
from
the
lower
step
descending
upon
her
and
together
they
slid
and
rolled
down
the
short
bank
while
the
train
like
an
irresponsible
nurse
who
had
slapped
her
charge
and
left
it
to
its
fate
ran
giddily
off
into
the
night
the
horror
of
being
deserted
helped
the
girl
to
rise
in
spite
of
bruises
and
shock
she
lifted
imploring
hands
to
the
unresponsive
cars
as
they
hurried
by
her
one
two
three
with
bright
windows
each
showing
a
passenger
comfortable
and
safe
inside
unconscious
of
her
need
a
moment
of
useless
screaming
running
trying
to
attract
some
attention
a
sickening
sense
of
terror
and
failure
and
the
last
car
slatted
itself
past
with
a
mocking
clatter
as
if
it
enjoyed
her
discomfort
margaret
stood
dazed
reaching
out
helpless
hands
then
dropped
them
at
her
sides
and
gazed
after
the
train
the
light
on
its
last
car
swinging
tauntingly
blinking
now
and
then
with
a
leer
in
its
eye
rapidly
vanishing
from
her
sight
into
the
depth
of
the
night
she
gasped
and
looked
about
her
for
the
station
that
but
a
short
moment
before
had
been
so
real
to
her
mind
and
lo
on
this
side
and
on
that
there
was
none
the
night
was
wide
like
a
great
floor
shut
in
by
a
low
vast
dome
of
curving
blue
set
with
the
largest
most
wonderful
stars
she
had
ever
seen
heavy
shadows
of
hovered
over
earth
darker
and
more
intense
than
the
unfathomable
blue
of
the
night
sky
it
seemed
like
the
secret
of
mysteries
wherein
no
human
foot
might
dare
intrude
it
was
incredible
that
such
could
be
but
common
sand
and
greasewood
wrapped
about
with
the
beauty
of
the
lonely
night
no
building
broke
the
inky
outlines
of
the
plain
nor
friendly
light
streamed
out
to
cheer
her
heart
not
even
a
tree
was
in
sight
except
on
the
far
horizon
where
a
heavy
line
of
deeper
darkness
might
mean
a
forest
nothing
absolutely
nothing
in
the
blue
deep
starry
dome
above
and
the
bluer
darkness
of
the
earth
below
save
one
sharp
shaft
ahead
like
a
black
mast
throwing
out
a
dark
arm
across
the
track
as
soon
as
she
sighted
it
she
picked
up
her
baggage
and
made
her
painful
way
toward
it
for
her
knees
and
wrist
were
bruised
and
her
baggage
was
heavy
a
soft
drip
drip
greeted
her
as
she
drew
nearer
something
plashing
down
among
the
cinders
by
the
track
then
she
saw
the
tall
column
with
its
arm
outstretched
and
looming
darker
among
the
the
outlines
of
a
it
was
so
she
recognized
the
and
knew
that
she
had
mistaken
a
pause
to
water
the
engine
for
a
regular
stop
at
a
station
her
soul
sank
within
her
as
she
came
up
to
the
dripping
water
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
dark
upright
as
if
in
some
way
it
could
help
her
she
dropped
her
baggage
and
stood
trembling
gazing
around
upon
the
beautiful
lonely
scene
in
horror
and
then
like
a
mirage
against
the
distance
there
melted
on
her
frightened
eyes
a
vision
of
her
father
and
mother
sitting
around
the
library
lamp
at
home
as
they
sat
every
evening
they
were
probably
reading
and
talking
at
this
very
minute
and
trying
not
to
miss
her
on
this
her
first
venture
away
from
the
home
into
the
great
world
to
teach
what
would
they
say
if
they
could
see
their
beloved
daughter
whom
they
had
sheltered
all
these
years
and
let
go
forth
so
reluctantly
now
in
all
her
confidence
of
youth
bound
by
almost
absurd
promises
to
be
careful
and
not
run
any
risks
yet
here
she
was
standing
alone
beside
a
in
the
midst
of
an
arizona
plain
no
knowing
how
many
miles
from
anywhere
at
somewhere
between
nine
and
ten
at
night
it
seemed
incredible
that
it
had
really
happened
perhaps
she
was
dreaming
a
few
moments
before
in
the
bright
car
surrounded
by
drowsy
almost
at
her
journey
end
as
she
supposed
and
now
having
merely
done
as
she
thought
right
she
was
stranded
here
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looked
again
up
the
track
half
expecting
to
see
the
train
come
back
for
her
surely
surely
the
conductor
or
the
porter
who
had
been
so
kind
would
discover
that
she
was
gone
and
do
something
about
it
they
could
leave
her
here
alone
on
the
prairie
it
would
be
too
dreadful
that
vision
of
her
father
and
mother
off
against
the
distance
how
it
shook
her
the
lamp
looked
bright
and
cheerful
and
she
could
see
her
father
head
with
its
heavy
white
hair
he
turned
to
look
at
her
mother
to
tell
her
of
something
he
read
in
the
paper
they
were
sitting
there
feeling
contented
and
almost
happy
about
her
and
she
their
little
girl
all
her
dignity
as
dropped
from
her
like
a
garment
now
she
was
standing
in
this
empty
space
alone
with
only
an
engine
to
keep
her
from
dying
and
only
the
barren
desolate
track
to
connect
her
with
the
world
of
men
and
women
she
dropped
her
head
upon
her
breast
and
the
tears
came
sobbing
choking
raining
down
then
off
in
the
distance
she
heard
a
low
rising
howl
of
some
snarling
angry
beast
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
stood
in
trembling
terror
clinging
to
the
tank
that
sound
was
coyotes
or
wolves
howling
she
had
read
about
them
but
had
not
expected
to
experience
them
in
such
a
situation
how
confidently
had
she
accepted
the
position
which
offered
her
the
opening
she
had
sought
for
the
splendid
career
that
she
hoped
was
to
follow
how
fearless
had
she
been
coyotes
nor
indians
nor
wild
cowboy
students
nothing
had
daunted
her
courage
besides
she
told
her
mother
it
was
very
different
going
to
a
town
from
what
it
would
be
if
she
were
a
missionary
going
to
the
wilds
it
was
an
important
school
she
was
to
teach
where
her
latin
and
german
and
mathematical
achievements
had
won
her
the
place
above
several
other
applicants
and
where
her
tact
was
expected
to
work
wonders
but
what
were
latin
and
german
and
mathematics
now
could
they
show
her
how
to
climb
a
would
tact
avail
with
a
hungry
wolf
the
howl
in
the
distance
seemed
to
come
nearer
she
cast
frightened
eyes
to
the
unresponsive
looming
high
and
dark
above
her
she
must
get
up
there
somehow
it
was
not
safe
to
stand
here
a
minute
besides
from
that
height
she
might
be
able
to
see
farther
and
perhaps
there
would
be
a
light
somewhere
and
she
might
cry
for
help
investigation
showed
a
set
of
rude
spikes
by
which
the
trainmen
were
wont
to
climb
up
and
margaret
prepared
to
ascend
them
she
set
her
dubiously
down
at
the
foot
would
it
be
safe
to
leave
it
there
she
had
read
how
coyotes
carried
off
a
hatchet
from
a
just
to
get
the
leather
thong
which
was
bound
about
the
handle
she
could
not
afford
to
lose
her
things
yet
how
could
she
climb
and
carry
that
heavy
burden
with
her
a
sudden
thought
came
her
simple
was
finished
with
a
silken
girdle
soft
and
long
wound
twice
about
her
waist
and
falling
in
tasseled
ends
swiftly
she
untied
it
and
knotted
one
end
firmly
to
the
handle
of
her
tying
the
other
end
securely
to
her
wrist
then
slowly
cautiously
with
many
a
look
upward
she
began
to
climb
it
seemed
miles
though
in
reality
it
was
but
a
short
distance
the
howling
beasts
in
the
distance
sounded
nearer
now
and
continually
making
her
heart
beat
wildly
she
was
stiff
and
bruised
from
her
falls
and
weak
with
fright
the
spikes
were
far
apart
and
each
step
of
progress
was
painful
and
difficult
it
was
good
at
last
to
rise
high
enough
to
see
over
the
and
feel
a
certain
confidence
in
her
defense
but
she
had
risen
already
beyond
the
short
length
of
her
silken
tether
and
the
was
dragging
painfully
on
her
arm
she
was
obliged
to
steady
herself
where
she
stood
and
pull
it
up
before
she
could
go
on
then
she
managed
to
get
it
swung
up
to
the
top
of
the
tank
in
a
comparatively
safe
place
one
more
long
spike
step
and
she
was
beside
it
the
tank
was
partly
roofed
over
so
that
she
had
room
enough
to
sit
on
the
edge
without
danger
of
falling
in
and
drowning
for
a
few
minutes
she
could
only
sit
still
and
be
thankful
and
try
to
get
her
breath
back
again
after
the
climb
but
presently
the
beauty
of
the
night
began
to
cast
its
spell
over
her
that
wonderful
blue
of
the
sky
it
had
ever
before
impressed
her
that
skies
were
blue
at
night
she
would
have
said
they
were
black
or
gray
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
remember
to
have
ever
seen
so
much
sky
at
once
before
nor
to
have
noticed
skies
in
general
until
now
this
sky
was
so
deeply
wonderfully
blue
the
stars
so
real
alive
and
sparkling
that
all
other
stars
she
had
ever
seen
paled
before
them
into
mere
imitations
the
spot
looked
like
one
of
taylor
pictures
of
the
holy
land
she
half
expected
to
see
a
shepherd
with
his
crook
and
sheep
approaching
her
out
of
the
dim
shadows
or
a
turbaned
david
with
his
lifted
hands
of
prayer
standing
off
among
the
depths
of
purple
darkness
it
would
not
have
been
out
of
keeping
if
a
walled
city
with
housetops
should
be
hidden
behind
the
clumps
of
farther
on
was
such
a
night
and
such
a
scene
as
this
perhaps
when
the
wise
men
started
to
follow
the
star
but
one
can
not
sit
on
the
edge
of
a
in
the
desert
night
alone
and
muse
long
on
art
and
history
it
was
cold
up
there
and
the
howling
seemed
nearer
than
before
there
was
no
sign
of
a
light
or
a
house
anywhere
and
not
even
a
sent
its
welcome
clatter
down
the
track
all
was
still
and
wide
and
lonely
save
that
terrifying
sound
of
the
beasts
such
stillness
as
she
had
not
ever
thought
could
be
a
fearful
silence
as
a
setting
for
the
awful
voices
of
the
wilds
the
bruises
and
scratches
she
had
acquired
set
up
a
fine
stinging
and
the
cold
seemed
to
sweep
down
and
take
possession
of
her
on
her
high
narrow
seat
she
was
growing
stiff
and
cramped
yet
dared
not
move
much
would
there
be
no
train
nor
any
help
would
she
have
to
sit
there
all
night
it
looked
so
very
near
to
the
ground
now
could
wild
beasts
climb
she
wondered
then
in
the
interval
of
silence
that
came
between
the
calling
of
those
wild
creatures
there
stole
a
sound
she
could
not
tell
at
first
what
it
was
a
slow
regular
plodding
sound
and
quite
far
away
she
looked
to
find
it
and
thought
she
saw
a
shape
move
out
of
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
track
but
she
could
not
be
sure
it
might
be
but
a
figment
of
her
brain
a
foolish
fancy
from
looking
so
long
at
the
huddled
bushes
on
the
dark
plain
yet
something
prompted
her
to
cry
out
and
when
she
heard
her
own
voice
she
cried
again
and
louder
wondering
why
she
had
not
cried
before
help
help
she
called
and
again
help
help
the
dark
shape
paused
and
turned
toward
her
she
was
sure
now
what
if
it
were
a
beast
instead
of
a
human
terrible
fear
took
possession
of
her
then
to
her
infinite
relief
a
nasal
voice
sounded
out
who
thar
but
when
she
opened
her
lips
to
answer
nothing
but
a
sob
would
come
to
them
for
a
minute
and
then
she
could
only
cry
pitifully
help
help
whar
be
you
twanged
the
voice
and
now
she
could
see
a
horse
and
rider
like
a
shadow
moving
toward
her
down
the
track
chapter
ii
the
horse
came
to
a
standstill
a
little
way
from
the
track
and
his
rider
let
forth
a
stream
of
strange
profanity
the
girl
shuddered
and
began
to
think
a
wild
beast
might
be
preferable
to
some
men
however
these
remarks
seemed
to
be
a
mere
formality
he
paused
and
addressed
her
heow
yeh
git
up
thar
drap
er
climb
he
was
a
little
wiry
man
with
a
bristly
protruding
chin
she
could
see
that
even
in
the
starlight
there
was
something
about
the
point
of
that
stubby
chin
that
she
shrank
from
inexpressibly
he
was
not
a
pleasant
man
to
look
upon
and
even
his
voice
was
unprepossessing
she
began
to
think
that
even
the
night
with
its
loneliness
and
unknown
perils
was
preferable
to
this
man
company
i
got
off
the
train
by
mistake
thinking
it
was
my
station
and
before
i
discovered
it
the

margaret
remembering
her
dignity
as
a
teacher
the
man
wheeled
his
horse
clear
around
and
looked
up
at
her
impudently
she
could
smell
bad
whisky
on
his
breath
say

mile
yet
an
i

noon
the
tears
suddenly
rushed
to
the
girl
eyes
as
the
horror
of
being
alone
in
the
night
again
took
possession
of
her
this
dreadful
man
frightened
her
but
the
thought
of
the
loneliness
filled
her
with
dismay
oh
she
cried
forgetting
her
insulted
dignity

faltered
margaret
in
dismay
wondering
what

say

there
a
loud
guffaw
greeted
her
question

light
down
pretty
speedy
fer
i
ca
wait
in
fear
and
trembling
margaret
descended
her
rude
ladder
step
by
step
primitive
man
seated
calmly
on
his
horse
making
no
attempt
whatever
to
assist
her
this
ai
no
he
grumbled
as
he
saw
the
in
her
hand
well
yerself
up
thar
i
reckon
we
pull
through
somehow
gim
me
the
luggage
margaret
stood
appalled
beside
the
bony
horse
and
his
uncouth
rider
did
he
actually
expect
her
to
ride
with
him
could
i
walk
she
faltered
hoping
he
would
offer
to
do
so
up
t
you
the
man
replied
indifferently
try
an
see
he
spoke
to
the
horse
and
it
started
forward
eagerly
while
the
girl
in
horror
struggled
on
behind
over
rough
uneven
ground
between
greasewood
and
cactus
back
into
the
trail
the
man
oblivious
of
her
presence
rode
contentedly
on
a
silent
shadow
on
a
dark
horse
wending
a
silent
way
between
the
clumps
of
other
shadows
until
bewildered
the
girl
almost
lost
sight
of
them
her
breath
came
short
her
ankle
turned
and
she
fell
with
both
hands
in
a
stinging
bed
of
cactus
she
cried
out
then
and
begged
him
to
stop
yer
lesson
hev
yeh
sweety
he
jeered
at
her
foolishly
well
get
in
yer
box
then
he
let
her
struggle
up
to
a
seat
behind
himself
with
very
little
assistance
but
when
she
was
seated
and
started
on
her
way
she
began
to
wish
she
had
stayed
behind
and
taken
any
perils
of
the
way
rather
than
trust
herself
in
proximity
to
this
creature
from
time
to
time
he
took
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
and
swallowed
a
portion
of
its
contents
becoming
fluent
in
his
language
as
they
proceeded
on
their
way
margaret
remained
silent
growing
more
and
more
frightened
every
time
the
bottle
came
out
at
last
he
offered
it
to
her
she
declined
it
with
cold
politeness
which
seemed
to
irritate
the
little
man
for
he
turned
suddenly
fierce
oh
yer
too
fine
to
take
a
drap
fer
good
are
yeh
wal
show
yeh
a
thing
er
two
my
pretty
lady
you
give
me
a
kiss
with
yer
two
cherry
lips
before
we
go
another
step
hear
my
sweetie
and
he
turned
with
a
silly
leer
to
enforce
his
command
but
with
a
cry
of
horror
margaret
slid
to
the
ground
and
ran
back
down
the
trail
as
hard
as
she
could
go
till
she
stumbled
and
fell
in
the
shelter
of
a
great
and
lay
sobbing
on
the
sand
the
man
turned
bleared
eyes
toward
her
and
watched
until
she
disappeared
then
sticking
his
chin
out
wickedly
he
slung
her
after
her
and
called
all
right
my
pretty
lady
go
yer
own
gait
an
yer
own
lesson
he
started
on
again
singing
a
drunken
song
under
the
blue
starry
dome
alone
sat
margaret
again
this
time
with
no
friendly
for
her
defense
and
took
counsel
with
herself
the
howling
coyotes
seemed
to
be
silenced
for
the
time
at
least
they
had
become
a
minor
quantity
in
her
equation
of
troubles
she
felt
now
that
man
was
her
greatest
menace
and
to
get
away
safely
from
him
back
to
that
friendly
and
the
dear
old
railroad
track
she
would
have
pledged
her
next
year
salary
she
stole
softly
to
the
place
where
she
had
heard
the
fall
and
picking
it
up
started
on
the
weary
road
back
to
the
tank
could
she
ever
find
the
way
the
trail
seemed
so
intangible
a
thing
her
sense
of
direction
so
confused
yet
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
shuddered
whenever
she
thought
of
the
man
who
had
been
her
companion
on
horseback
when
the
man
reached
camp
he
set
his
horse
loose
and
stumbled
into
the
door
of
the
log
calling
loudly
for
something
to
eat
the
men
were
sitting
around
the
room
on
the
rough
benches
and
bunks
smoking
their
pipes
or
stolidly
staring
into
the
dying
fire
two
smoky
that
hung
from
spikes
driven
high
in
the
logs
cast
a
weird
light
over
the
company
eight
men
in
all
rough
and
hardened
with
exposure
to
stormy
life
and
weather
they
were
men
with
unkempt
beards
and
uncombed
hair
their
coarse
cotton
shirts
open
at
the
neck
their
brawny
arms
bare
above
the
elbow
with
crimes
and
sorrows
and
hard
living
written
large
across
their
faces
there
was
one
a
boy
in
looks
with
smooth
face
and
white
skin
healthily
flushed
in
places
like
a
baby
his
face
too
was
hard
and
set
in
sternness
like
a
mask
as
if
life
had
used
him
badly
but
behind
it
was
a
fineness
of
feature
and
spirit
that
could
not
be
utterly
hidden
they
called
him
the
kid
and
thought
it
was
his
youth
that
made
him
different
from
them
all
for
he
was
only
and
not
one
of
the
rest
was
under
forty
they
were
doing
their
best
to
help
him
get
over
that
innate
fineness
that
was
his
natural
inheritance
but
although
he
stopped
at
nothing
and
played
his
part
always
with
the
ease
of
one
old
in
the
ways
of
the
world
yet
he
kept
a
quiet
reserve
about
him
a
kind
of
charm
beyond
which
they
had
not
been
able
to
go
he
was
playing
cards
with
three
others
at
the
table
when
the
man
came
in
and
did
not
look
up
at
the
entrance
the
woman
white
and
hopeless
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
when
the
man
came
and
obediently
set
about
getting
his
supper
but
her
lifeless
face
never
changed
expression
brung
a
gal
of
me
part
way
boasted
the
man
as
he
flung
himself
into
a
seat
by
the
table
thought
you
fellers
might
like
t
see
but
she
got
too
high
an
mighty
fer
me
would
take
a
pull
at
bottle
me
shrieked
like
a
catamount
when
i
kissed
found
hangin
on
th
got
off
th
wrong
place
one
o
yer
highbrows
out
o
th
parlor
car
good
lesson
fer
the
boy
looked
up
from
his
cards
sternly
his
keen
eyes
boring
through
the
man
where
is
she
now
he
asked
quietly
and
all
the
men
in
the
room
looked
up
uneasily
there
was
that
tone
and
accent
again
that
made
the
boy
alien
from
them
what
was
it
the
man
felt
it
and
snarled
his
answer
angrily
dropped
on
trail
an
threw
her
after
got
no
use
fer
thet
kind
wonder
what
they
was
created
fer
ai
no
good
to
nobody
not
even
and
he
laughed
a
harsh
cackle
that
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
the
boy
threw
down
his
cards
and
went
out
shutting
the
door
in
a
few
minutes
the
men
heard
two
horses
pass
the
end
of
the
toward
the
trail
but
no
one
looked
up
nor
spoke
you
could
not
have
told
by
the
flicker
of
an
eyelash
that
they
knew
where
the
boy
had
gone
she
was
sitting
in
the
deep
shadow
of
a
that
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
trail
like
a
great
blot
her
beside
her
her
breath
coming
short
with
exertion
and
excitement
when
she
heard
a
cheery
whistle
in
the
distance
just
an
old
dating
back
some
years
and
discarded
now
as
hackneyed
even
by
the
street
pianos
at
home
but
oh
how
good
it
sounded
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
the
ground
was
cold
and
struck
a
chill
through
her
garments
as
she
sat
there
alone
in
the
night
on
came
the
clear
musical
whistle
and
she
peered
out
of
the
shadow
with
eager
eyes
and
frightened
heart
dared
she
risk
it
again
should
she
call
or
should
she
hold
her
breath
and
keep
still
hoping
he
would
pass
her
by
unnoticed
before
she
could
decide
two
horses
stopped
almost
in
front
of
her
and
a
rider
swung
himself
down
he
stood
before
her
as
if
it
were
day
and
he
could
see
her
quite
plainly
you
need
be
afraid
he
explained
calmly
i
thought
i
had
better
look
you
up
after
the
old
man
got
home
and
gave
his
report
he
was
pretty
well
tanked
up
and
not
exactly
a
fit
escort
for
ladies
the
trouble
like
an
angel
of
deliverance
he
looked
to
her
as
he
stood
in
the
starlight
outlined
in
silhouette
against
the
wide
wonderful
sky
broad
shoulders
head
curls
handsome
contour
even
in
the
darkness
there
was
about
him
an
air
of
quiet
strength
which
gave
her
confidence
oh
thank
you
she
gasped
with
a
quick
little
relieved
sob
in
her
voice
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
i
was
just
a
little
frightened
i
think
she
attempted
to
rise
but
her
foot
caught
in
her
skirt
and
she
sank
wearily
back
to
the
sand
again
the
boy
stooped
over
and
lifted
her
to
her
feet
you
certainly
are
some
plucky
girl
he
commented
looking
down
at
her
slender
height
as
she
stood
beside
him
a
frightened
were
you
well
i
should
say
you
had
a
right
to
be
well
not
exactly
frightened
you
know
said
margaret
taking
a
deep
breath
and
trying
to
steady
her
voice
i
think
perhaps
i
was
more
mortified
than
frightened
to
think
i
made
such
a
blunder
as
to
get
off
the
train
before
i
reached
my
station
you
see
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
frightened
but
when
i
heard
that
awful
howl
of
some
beast
and
then
that
terrible
man
she
shuddered
and
put
her
hands
suddenly
over
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
all
memory
of
it
more
than
one
kind
of
beasts
commented
the
boy
briefly
well
you
need
worry
about
him
he
having
his
supper
and
he
be
sound
asleep
by
the
time
we
get
back
oh
have
we
got
to
go
where
he
is
gasped
margaret
is
there
some
other
place
is
ashland
very
far
away
that
is
where
i
am
going
no
other
place
where
you
could
go
ashland
a
good
miles
from
here
but
you
be
all
right
mom
wallis
look
out
for
you
she
is
much
of
a
looker
but
she
has
a
kind
heart
she
pulled
me
through
once
when
i
was
just
about
flickering
out
come
on
you
be
pretty
tired
we
better
be
getting
back
mom
wallis
make
you
comfortable
and
then
you
can
get
off
good
and
early
in
the
morning
without
an
apology
and
as
if
it
were
the
common
courtesy
of
the
desert
he
stooped
and
lifted
her
easily
to
the
saddle
of
the
second
horse
placed
the
bridle
in
her
hands
then
swung
the
up
on
his
own
horse
and
sprang
into
the
saddle
chapter
iii
he
turned
the
horses
about
and
took
charge
of
her
just
as
if
he
were
accustomed
to
managing
stray
ladies
in
the
wilderness
every
day
of
his
life
and
understood
the
situation
perfectly
and
margaret
settled
wearily
into
her
saddle
and
looked
about
her
with
content
suddenly
again
the
wide
wonder
of
the
night
possessed
her
involuntarily
she
breathed
a
soft
little
exclamation
of
awe
and
delight
her
companion
turned
to
her
questioningly
does
it
always
seem
so
big
here
so
limitless
she
asked
in
explanation
it
is
so
far
to
everywhere
it
takes
one
breath
away
and
yet
the
stars
hang
close
like
a
protection
it
gives
one
the
feeling
of
being
alone
in
the
great
universe
with
god
does
it
always
seem
so
out
here
he
looked
at
her
curiously
her
pure
profile
turned
up
to
the
wide
dome
of
luminous
blue
above
his
voice
was
strangely
low
and
wondering
as
he
answered
after
a
moment
silence
no
it
is
not
always
so
he
said
i
have
seen
it
when
it
was
more
like
being
alone
in
the
great
universe
with
the
devil
there
was
a
tremendous
earnestness
in
his
tone
that
the
girl
felt
meant
more
than
was
on
the
surface
she
turned
to
look
at
the
fine
young
face
beside
her
in
the
starlight
she
could
not
make
out
the
bitter
hardness
of
lines
that
were
beginning
to
be
carved
about
his
sensitive
mouth
but
there
was
so
much
sadness
in
his
voice
that
her
heart
went
out
to
him
in
pity
oh
she
said
gently
it
would
be
awful
that
way
yes
i
can
understand
i
felt
so
a
little
while
that
terrible
man
was
with
me
and
she
shuddered
again
at
the
remembrance
again
he
gave
her
that
curious
look
there
are
worse
things
than
pop
wallis
out
here
he
said
gravely
but
i
grant
you
there
some
class
to
the
skies
it
a
case
of
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
man
is
vile
and
with
the
words
his
tone
grew
almost
flippant
it
hurt
her
sensitive
nature
and
without
knowing
it
she
half
drew
away
a
little
farther
from
him
and
murmured
sadly
oh
as
if
he
had
classed
himself
with
the
man
he
had
been
describing
instantly
he
felt
her
withdrawal
and
grew
grave
again
as
if
he
would
atone
wait
till
you
see
this
sky
at
the
dawn
he
said
it
will
burn
red
fire
off
there
in
the
east
like
a
hearth
in
a
palace
and
all
this
dome
will
glow
like
a
great
pink
jewel
set
in
gold
if
you
want
a
classy
sky
there
you
have
it
nothing
like
it
in
the
east
there
was
a
strange
mingling
of
culture
and
roughness
in
his
speech
the
girl
could
not
make
him
out
yet
there
had
been
a
palpitating
earnestness
in
his
description
that
showed
he
had
felt
the
dawn
in
his
very
soul
you
are
a
poet
perhaps
she
asked
half
shyly
or
an
artist
she
hazarded
he
laughed
roughly
and
seemed
embarrassed
no
i
just
a
bum
a
sort
of
roughneck
out
of
a
job
she
was
silent
watching
him
against
the
starlight
a
kind
of
embarrassment
upon
her
after
his
last
remark
you
have
been
here
long
she
asked
at
last
three
years
he
said
it
almost
curtly
and
turned
his
head
away
as
if
there
were
something
in
his
face
he
would
hide
she
knew
there
was
something
unhappy
in
his
life
unconsciously
her
tone
took
on
a
sympathetic
sound
and
do
you
get
homesick
and
want
to
go
back
ever
she
asked
his
tone
was
fairly
savage
now
no
the
silence
which
followed
became
almost
oppressive
before
the
boy
finally
turned
and
in
his
kindly
tone
began
to
question
her
about
the
happenings
which
had
stranded
her
in
the
desert
alone
at
night
so
she
came
to
tell
him
briefly
and
frankly
about
herself
as
he
questioned
how
she
came
to
be
in
arizona
all
alone
my
father
is
a
minister
in
a
small
town
in
new
york
state
when
i
finished
college
i
had
to
do
something
and
i
had
an
offer
of
this
ashland
school
through
a
friend
of
ours
who
had
a
brother
out
here
father
and
mother
would
rather
have
kept
me
nearer
home
of
course
but
everybody
says
the
best
opportunities
are
in
the
west
and
this
was
a
good
opening
so
they
finally
consented
they
would
send
for
me
to
come
back
if
they
knew
what
a
mess
i
have
made
of
things
right
at
the
start
getting
out
of
the
train
in
the
desert
but
you
not
discouraged
said
her
companion
half
wonderingly
some
nerve
you
have
with
you
i
guess
you
manage
to
hit
it
off
in
ashland
it
the
limit
as
far
as
discipline
is
concerned
i
understand
but
i
guess
you
put
one
over
on
them
i
bank
on
you
after
sure
thing
she
turned
a
laughing
face
toward
him
thank
you
she
said
but
i
do
see
how
you
know
all
that
i
sure
i
did
do
anything
particularly
nervy
there
was
anything
else
to
do
but
what
i
did
if
i
tried
most
girls
would
have
fainted
and
screamed
and
fainted
again
when
they
were
rescued
stated
the
boy
out
of
a
vast
experience
i
never
fainted
in
my
life
said
margaret
earle
with
disdain
i
do
think
i
should
care
to
faint
out
in
the
vast
universe
like
this
it
would
be
rather
inopportune
i
should
think
then
because
she
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
growing
very
chummy
with
this
stranger
in
the
dark
she
asked
the
first
question
that
came
into
her
head
what
was
your
college
that
he
had
not
been
to
college
never
entered
her
head
there
was
something
in
his
speech
and
manner
that
made
it
a
foregone
conclusion
it
was
as
if
she
had
struck
him
forcibly
in
his
face
so
sudden
and
sharp
a
silence
ensued
for
a
second
then
he
answered
gruffly
yale
and
plunged
into
an
elaborate
account
of
arizona
in
its
early
ages
including
a
detailed
description
of
the
and
their
homes
which
were
still
to
be
seen
high
in
the
rocks
of
the
cañons
not
many
miles
to
the
west
of
where
they
were
riding
margaret
was
keen
to
hear
it
all
and
asked
many
questions
declaring
her
intention
of
visiting
those
at
her
earliest
opportunity
it
was
so
wonderful
to
her
to
be
actually
out
here
where
were
all
sorts
of
queer
things
about
which
she
had
read
and
wondered
it
did
not
occur
to
her
until
the
next
day
to
realize
that
her
companion
had
of
intention
led
her
off
the
topic
of
himself
and
kept
her
from
asking
any
more
personal
questions
he
told
her
of
the
petrified
forest
just
over
some
low
hills
off
to
the
left
acres
and
acres
of
agatized
chips
and
trunks
of
great
trees
all
turned
to
eternal
stone
called
by
the
indians
yeitso
bones
after
the
great
giant
of
that
name
whom
an
ancient
indian
hero
killed
he
described
the
coloring
of
the
brilliant
days
in
arizona
where
you
stand
on
the
edge
of
some
mesa
and
look
off
through
the
clear
air
to
mountains
that
seem
quite
near
by
but
are
in
reality
more
than
two
hundred
miles
away
he
pictured
the
strange
colors
and
lights
of
the
place
ledges
of
rock
yellow
white
and
green
drab
and
maroon
and
tumbled
piles
of
red
boulders
shadowy
buttes
in
the
distance
serrated
cliffs
against
the
horizon
not
blue
but
rosy
pink
in
the
heated
haze
of
the
air
and
perhaps
a
great
lonely
eagle
poised
above
the
silent
brilliant
waste
he
told
it
not
in
book
language
with
turn
of
phrase
and
smoothly
flowing
sentences
but
in
simple
frank
words
as
a
boy
might
describe
a
picture
to
one
he
knew
would
appreciate
it
for
her
sake
and
not
because
he
loved
to
put
it
into
words
but
in
a
new
stumbling
way
letting
out
the
beauty
that
had
somehow
crept
into
his
heart
in
spite
of
all
the
rough
attempts
to
keep
all
gentle
things
out
of
his
nature
the
girl
as
she
listened
marveled
more
and
more
what
manner
of
youth
this
might
be
who
had
come
to
her
out
of
the
desert
night
she
forgot
her
weariness
as
she
listened
in
the
thrill
of
wonder
over
the
new
mysterious
country
to
which
she
had
come
she
forgot
that
she
was
riding
through
the
great
darkness
with
an
utter
stranger
to
a
place
she
knew
not
and
to
experiences
most
dubious
her
fears
had
fled
and
she
was
actually
enjoying
herself
and
responding
to
the
wonderful
story
of
the
place
with
exclamations
of
delight
and
wonder
from
time
to
time
in
the
distance
there
sounded
forth
those
awful
howls
of
wild
beasts
that
she
had
heard
when
she
sat
alone
by
the
and
each
time
she
heard
a
shudder
passed
through
her
and
instinctively
she
swerved
a
trifle
toward
her
companion
then
straightened
up
again
and
tried
to
seem
not
to
notice
the
boy
saw
and
watched
her
brave
attempts
at
with
deep
appreciation
but
suddenly
as
they
rode
and
talked
a
dark
form
appeared
across
their
way
a
little
ahead
lithe
and
stealthy
and
furry
and
two
awful
eyes
like
green
lamps
glared
for
an
instant
then
disappeared
silently
among
the
mesquite
bushes
she
did
not
cry
out
nor
start
her
very
veins
seemed
frozen
with
horror
and
she
could
not
have
spoken
if
she
tried
it
was
all
over
in
a
second
and
the
creature
gone
so
that
she
almost
doubted
her
senses
and
wondered
if
she
had
seen
aright
then
one
hand
went
swiftly
to
her
throat
and
she
shrank
toward
her
companion
there
is
nothing
to
fear
he
said
reassuringly
and
laid
a
strong
hand
comfortingly
across
the
neck
of
her
horse
the
was
as
unwilling
for
our
company
as
we
for
hers
besides
look
here
and
he
raised
his
hand
and
shot
into
the
air
she
not
come
near
us
now
i
am
not
afraid
said
the
girl
bravely
at
least
i
do
think
i
am
very
but
it
all
so
new
and
unexpected
you
know
do
people
around
here
always
shoot
in
that
well
unpremeditated
fashion
they
laughed
together
excuse
me
he
said
i
did
realize
the
shot
might
startle
you
even
more
than
the
wildcat
it
seems
i
not
fit
to
have
charge
of
a
lady
i
told
you
i
was
a
roughneck
you
taking
care
of
me
beautifully
said
margaret
earle
loyally
and
i
glad
to
get
used
to
shots
if
that
the
thing
to
be
expected
often
just
then
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
low
rolling
hill
and
ahead
in
the
darkness
there
gleamed
a
tiny
wizened
light
set
in
a
blotch
of
blackness
under
the
great
white
stars
it
burned
a
sickly
red
and
seemed
out
of
harmony
with
the
night
there
we
are
said
the
boy
pointing
toward
it
that
the
you
need
be
afraid
pop
wallis
be
snoring
by
this
time
and
we
come
away
before
he
about
in
the
morning
he
always
sleeps
late
after
he
been
off
on
a
bout
he
been
gone
three
days
selling
some
cattle
and
he
have
a
pretty
good
top
on
the
girl
caught
her
breath
gave
one
wistful
look
up
at
the
wide
starry
sky
a
furtive
glance
at
the
strong
face
of
her
protector
and
submitted
to
being
lifted
down
to
the
ground
before
her
loomed
the
small
and
mean
built
of
logs
with
only
one
window
in
which
the
flicker
of
the
lanterns
menaced
with
unknown
trials
and
possible
perils
for
her
to
meet
chapter
iv
when
margaret
earle
dawned
upon
that
the
men
sat
up
with
one
accord
ran
their
rough
red
hands
through
their
rough
tousled
hair
smoothed
their
beards
took
down
their
feet
from
the
benches
where
they
were
resting
that
was
as
far
as
their
etiquette
led
them
most
of
them
continued
to
smoke
their
pipes
and
all
of
them
stared
at
her
unreservedly
such
a
sight
of
exquisite
feminine
beauty
had
not
come
to
their
eyes
in
many
a
long
day
even
in
the
dim
light
of
the
smoky
lanterns
and
with
the
dust
and
weariness
of
travel
upon
her
margaret
earle
was
a
beautiful
girl
that
what
the
matter
father
said
her
mother
when
the
subject
of
margaret
going
west
to
teach
had
first
been
mentioned
she
too
beautiful
far
too
beautiful
to
go
among
savages
if
she
were
homely
and
old
now
she
might
be
safe
that
would
be
a
different
matter
yet
margaret
had
prevailed
and
was
here
in
the
wild
country
now
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
log
cabin
she
read
in
the
unveiled
admiration
that
startled
from
the
eyes
of
the
men
the
meaning
of
her
mother
fears
yet
withal
it
was
a
kindly
admiration
not
unmixed
with
awe
for
there
was
about
her
beauty
a
touch
of
the
spiritual
which
set
her
above
the
common
run
of
women
making
men
feel
her
purity
and
sweetness
and
inclining
their
hearts
to
worship
rather
than
be
bold
the
boy
had
been
right
pop
wallis
was
asleep
and
out
of
the
way
from
a
little
shed
room
at
one
end
his
snoring
marked
time
in
the
silence
that
the
advent
of
the
girl
made
in
the
place
in
the
doorway
of
the
kitchen
offset
mom
wallis
stood
with
her
passionless
face
a
face
from
which
all
emotions
had
long
ago
been
burned
by
cruel
fires
and
looked
at
the
girl
whose
expression
was
vivid
with
her
opening
life
all
haloed
in
a
rosy
glow
a
kind
of
wistful
contortion
passed
over
mom
wallis
hopeless
countenance
as
if
she
saw
before
her
in
all
its
possibility
of
perfection
the
life
that
she
herself
had
lost
perhaps
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
features
to
show
tenderness
but
a
glow
of
something
like
it
burned
in
her
eyes
though
she
only
turned
away
with
the
same
old
apathetic
air
and
without
a
word
went
about
preparing
a
meal
for
the
stranger
margaret
looked
wildly
fearfully
around
the
rough
assemblage
when
she
first
entered
the
long
low
room
but
instantly
the
boy
introduced
her
as
the
new
teacher
for
the
ridge
school
beyond
the
junction
and
these
were
long
bill
big
jim
the
fiddling
boss
jasper
kemp
forbes
stocky
croaker
and
fudge
an
inspiration
fell
upon
the
frightened
girl
and
she
acknowledged
the
introduction
by
a
radiant
smile
followed
by
the
offering
of
her
small
gloved
hand
each
man
in
dumb
bewilderment
instantly
became
her
slave
and
accepted
the
offered
hand
with
more
or
less
pleasure
and
embarrassment
the
girl
proved
her
right
to
be
called
tactful
and
seeing
her
advantage
followed
it
up
quickly
by
a
few
bright
words
these
men
were
of
an
utterly
different
type
from
any
she
had
ever
met
before
but
they
had
in
their
eyes
a
kind
of
homage
which
pop
wallis
had
not
shown
and
they
were
not
repulsive
to
her
besides
the
boy
was
in
the
background
and
her
nerve
had
returned
the
boy
knew
how
a
lady
should
be
treated
she
was
quite
ready
to
play
up
to
his
lead
it
was
the
boy
who
brought
the
only
chair
the
afforded
a
rude
affair
and
helped
her
off
with
her
coat
and
hat
in
his
easy
friendly
way
as
if
he
had
known
her
all
his
life
while
the
men
to
whom
such
gallant
ways
were
foreign
sat
awkwardly
by
and
watched
in
wonder
and
amaze
most
of
all
they
were
astonished
at
the
kid
that
he
could
fall
so
naturally
into
intimate
talk
with
this
delicate
beautiful
woman
she
was
another
of
his
kind
a
creature
not
made
in
the
same
mold
as
theirs
they
saw
it
now
and
watched
the
fairy
play
with
almost
childish
interest
just
to
hear
her
call
him
mr
gardley
lance
gardley
that
was
what
he
had
told
them
was
his
name
the
day
he
came
among
them
they
had
not
heard
it
since
the
kid
gardley
there
it
was
the
difference
between
them
they
looked
at
the
girl
half
jealously
yet
proudly
at
the
boy
he
was
theirs
yes
in
a
way
he
was
theirs
had
they
not
found
him
in
the
wilderness
sick
and
nigh
to
death
and
nursed
him
back
to
life
again
he
was
theirs
but
he
knew
how
to
drop
into
her
world
too
and
not
be
ashamed
they
were
glad
that
he
could
even
while
it
struck
them
with
a
pang
that
some
day
he
would
go
back
to
the
world
to
which
he
belonged
and
where
they
could
never
be
at
home
it
was
a
marvel
to
watch
her
eat
the
coarse
and
pork
that
mom
wallis
brought
her
it
might
have
been
a
banquet
the
pleasant
way
she
seemed
to
look
at
it
just
like
a
bird
she
tasted
it
daintily
and
smiled
showing
her
white
teeth
there
was
nothing
of
the
idea
of
greediness
that
each
man
knew
he
himself
felt
after
a
fast
it
was
all
beautiful
the
way
she
handled
the
fork
and
the
old
steel
knife
they
watched
and
dropped
their
eyes
abashed
as
at
a
lovely
sacrament
they
had
not
felt
before
that
eating
could
be
an
art
they
did
not
know
what
art
meant
such
strange
talk
too
but
the
kid
seemed
to
understand
about
the
sky
their
old
common
sky
with
stars
that
they
saw
every
night
making
such
a
fuss
about
that
with
words
like
wide
infinite
azure
and
gems
each
man
went
furtively
out
that
night
before
he
slept
and
took
a
new
look
at
the
sky
to
see
if
he
could
understand
the
boy
was
planning
so
the
night
would
be
but
brief
he
knew
the
girl
was
afraid
he
kept
the
talk
going
enthusiastically
drawing
in
one
or
two
of
the
men
now
and
again
long
bill
forgot
himself
and
laughed
out
a
hoarse
guffaw
then
stopped
as
if
he
had
been
choked
stocky
red
in
the
face
told
a
funny
story
when
commanded
by
the
boy
and
then
dissolved
in
mortification
over
his
blunders
the
fiddling
boss
obediently
got
down
his
fiddle
from
the
smoky
corner
beside
the
fireplace
and
played
a
weird
old
tune
or
two
and
then
they
sang
first
the
men
with
hoarse
quavering
approach
and
final
roar
of
wild
sweetness
then
margaret
and
the
boy
in
duet
and
finally
margaret
alone
with
a
few
bashful
chords
on
the
fiddle
feeling
their
way
as
accompaniment
mom
wallis
had
long
ago
stopped
her
work
and
was
sitting
huddled
in
the
doorway
on
a
with
weary
folded
hands
and
a
strange
wistfulness
on
her
apathetic
face
a
fine
silence
had
settled
over
the
group
as
the
girl
recognizing
her
power
and
the
pleasure
she
was
giving
sang
on
now
and
then
the
boy
when
he
knew
the
song
would
join
in
with
his
rich
tenor
it
was
a
strange
night
and
when
she
finally
lay
down
to
rest
on
a
hard
cot
with
a
blanket
for
covering
and
mom
wallis
as
her
margaret
earle
could
not
help
wondering
what
her
mother
and
father
would
think
now
if
they
could
see
her
would
they
not
perhaps
almost
prefer
the
and
the
lonely
desert
for
her
to
her
present
surroundings
nevertheless
she
slept
soundly
after
her
terrible
excitement
and
woke
with
a
start
of
wonder
in
the
early
morning
to
hear
the
men
outside
splashing
water
and
humming
or
whistling
bits
of
the
tunes
she
had
sung
to
them
the
night
before
mom
wallis
was
standing
over
her
looking
down
with
a
hunger
in
her
eyes
at
the
bright
waves
of
margaret
hair
and
the
soft
cheeks
you
got
dretful
purty
hair
said
mom
wallis
wistfully
margaret
looked
up
and
smiled
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
you
would
it
but
i
was
young
an
purty
oncet
beats
all
how
much
it
counts
to
be
young
an
purty
but
land
it
do
last
long
make
the
most
of
it
while
you
got
it
browning
immortal
words
came
to
margaret
lips
grow
old
along
with
me
the
best
is
yet
to
be
the
last
of
life
for
which
the
first
was
made
but
she
checked
them
just
in
time
and
could
only
smile
mutely
how
could
she
speak
such
thoughts
amid
these
intolerable
surroundings
then
with
sudden
impulse
she
reached
up
to
the
astonished
woman
and
drawing
her
down
kissed
her
sallow
cheek
oh
said
mom
wallis
starting
back
and
laying
her
bony
hands
upon
the
place
where
she
had
been
kissed
as
if
it
hurt
her
while
a
dull
red
stole
up
from
her
neck
over
her
cheeks
and
high
forehead
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
all
at
once
she
turned
her
back
upon
her
visitor
and
the
tears
of
the
years
streamed
down
her
impassive
face
do
mind
me
she
choked
after
a
minute
i
liked
it
real
good
only
it
kind
of
give
me
a
turn
then
after
a
second
it
time
t
eat
you
wash
outside
after
the
men
is
done
that
thought
margaret
had
been
the
scheme
of
this
woman
whole
life
after
the
men
is
done
so
after
all
the
night
was
passed
in
safety
and
a
wonderful
dawning
had
come
the
blue
of
the
morning
so
different
from
the
blue
of
the
night
sky
was
nevertheless
just
as
unfathomable
the
air
seemed
filled
with
straying
so
sparkling
was
the
clearness
of
the
light
but
now
a
mountain
rose
in
the
distance
with
bounds
to
stand
across
the
vision
and
dispel
the
illusion
of
the
night
that
the
sky
came
down
to
the
earth
all
around
like
a
dome
there
were
mountains
on
all
sides
and
a
slender
dark
line
of
mesquite
set
off
the
more
delicate
colorings
of
the
plain
into
the
morning
they
rode
margaret
and
the
boy
before
pop
wallis
was
yet
awake
while
all
the
other
men
stood
round
and
watched
eager
jealous
for
the
handshake
and
the
parting
smile
they
told
her
they
hoped
she
would
come
again
and
sing
for
them
and
each
one
had
an
awkward
word
of
parting
whatever
margaret
earle
might
do
with
her
school
she
had
won
seven
loyal
friends
in
the
camp
and
she
rode
away
amid
their
admiring
glances
which
lingered
too
on
the
broad
shoulders
and
wide
sombrero
of
her
escort
riding
by
her
side
wal
that
the
end
o
him
i
drawled
long
bill
with
a
deep
sigh
as
the
riders
passed
into
the
valley
out
of
their
sight
h
said
jasper
kemp
hungrily
i
thinks
it
jes
beginnin
maybe
so
maybe
so
said
big
jim
dreamily
the
morning
was
full
of
wonder
for
the
girl
who
had
come
straight
from
an
eastern
city
the
view
from
the
top
of
the
mesa
or
the
cool
dim
entrance
of
a
cañon
where
great
ferns
fringed
and
feathered
its
walls
and
strange
caves
hollowed
out
in
the
rocks
far
above
made
real
the
stories
she
had
read
of
the
it
was
a
new
world
the
boy
was
charming
she
could
not
have
picked
out
among
her
city
acquaintances
a
man
who
would
have
done
the
honors
of
the
desert
more
delightfully
than
he
she
had
thought
him
handsome
in
the
starlight
and
in
the
the
night
before
but
now
that
the
morning
shone
upon
him
she
could
not
keep
from
looking
at
him
his
fresh
color
which
no
wind
and
weather
could
quite
subdue
his
eyes
with
that
mixture
of
thoughtfulness
and
reverence
and
daring
his
crisp
brown
curls
glinting
with
gold
in
the
sunlight
all
made
him
good
to
look
upon
there
was
something
about
the
firm
set
of
his
lips
and
chin
that
made
her
feel
a
hidden
strength
about
him
when
they
camped
a
little
while
for
lunch
he
showed
the
thoughtfulness
and
care
for
her
comfort
that
many
an
older
man
might
not
have
had
even
his
talk
was
a
mixture
of
boyishness
and
experience
and
he
seemed
to
know
her
thoughts
before
she
had
them
fully
spoken
i
do
not
understand
it
she
said
looking
him
frankly
in
the
eyes
at
last
how
ever
in
the
world
did
one
like
get
landed
among
all
those
dreadful
men
of
course
in
their
way
some
of
them
are
not
so
bad
but
they
are
not
like
you
not
in
the
least
and
never
could
be
they
were
riding
out
upon
the
plain
now
in
the
full
afternoon
light
and
a
short
time
would
bring
them
to
her
destination
a
sad
set
look
came
quickly
into
the
boy
eyes
and
his
face
grew
almost
hard
it
an
old
story
i
suppose
you
heard
it
before
he
said
and
his
voice
tried
to
take
on
a
careless
note
but
failed
i
did
make
good
back
there
he
waved
his
hand
sharply
toward
the
east
so
i
came
out
here
to
begin
again
but
i
guess
i
have
made
good
here
either
not
in
the
way
i
meant
when
i
came
you
ca
you
know
said
margaret
not
here
why
he
looked
at
her
earnestly
as
if
he
felt
the
answer
might
help
him
because
you
have
to
go
back
where
you
did
make
good
and
pick
up
the
lost
opportunities
you
ca
really
make
good
till
you
do
that
where
you
left
but
suppose
it
too
late
it
never
too
late
if
we
in
earnest
and
not
too
proud
there
was
a
long
silence
then
while
the
boy
looked
thoughtfully
off
at
the
mountains
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
to
call
attention
to
the
beauty
of
a
silver
cloud
that
floated
lazily
on
the
horizon
but
margaret
earle
had
seen
the
look
in
his
gray
eyes
and
was
not
deceived
a
few
minutes
later
they
crossed
another
mesa
and
descended
to
the
enterprising
little
town
where
the
girl
was
to
begin
her
winter
work
the
very
houses
and
streets
seemed
to
rise
briskly
and
hasten
to
meet
them
those
last
few
minutes
of
their
ride
now
that
the
experience
was
almost
over
the
girl
realized
that
she
had
enjoyed
it
intensely
and
that
she
dreaded
inexpressibly
that
she
must
bid
to
this
friend
of
a
few
hours
and
face
an
unknown
world
it
had
been
a
wonderful
day
and
now
it
was
almost
done
the
two
looked
at
each
other
and
realized
that
their
meeting
had
been
an
epoch
in
their
lives
that
neither
would
soon
forget
that
neither
wanted
to
forget
chapter
v
slower
the
horses
walked
and
slower
the
voices
of
the
boy
and
girl
were
low
when
they
spoke
about
the
common
things
by
the
wayside
once
their
eyes
met
and
they
smiled
with
something
both
sad
and
glad
in
them
margaret
was
watching
the
young
man
by
her
side
and
wondering
at
herself
he
was
different
from
any
man
whose
life
had
come
near
to
hers
before
he
was
wild
and
worldly
she
could
see
that
and
unrestrained
by
many
of
the
things
that
were
vital
principles
with
her
and
yet
she
felt
strangely
drawn
to
him
and
wonderfully
at
home
in
his
company
she
could
not
understand
herself
nor
him
it
was
as
if
his
real
soul
had
looked
out
of
his
eyes
and
spoken
untrammeled
by
the
circumstances
of
birth
or
breeding
or
habit
and
she
knew
him
for
a
kindred
spirit
and
yet
he
was
far
from
being
one
in
whom
she
would
have
expected
even
to
find
a
friend
where
was
her
confidence
of
yesterday
why
was
it
that
she
dreaded
to
have
this
strong
young
protector
leave
her
to
meet
alone
a
world
of
strangers
whom
yesterday
at
this
time
she
would
have
gladly
welcomed
now
when
his
face
grew
thoughtful
and
sad
she
saw
the
hard
bitter
lines
that
were
beginning
to
be
graven
about
his
lips
and
her
heart
ached
over
what
he
had
said
about
not
making
good
she
wondered
if
there
was
anything
else
she
could
say
to
help
him
but
no
words
came
to
her
and
the
sad
set
look
about
his
lips
warned
her
that
perhaps
she
had
said
enough
he
was
not
one
who
needed
a
long
dissertation
to
bring
a
thought
home
to
his
consciousness
gravely
they
rode
to
the
station
to
see
about
margaret
trunks
and
make
inquiries
for
the
school
and
the
house
where
she
had
arranged
to
board
then
margaret
sent
a
telegram
to
her
mother
to
say
that
she
had
arrived
safely
and
so
when
all
was
done
and
there
was
no
longer
an
excuse
for
lingering
the
boy
realized
that
he
must
leave
her
they
stood
alone
for
just
a
moment
while
the
voluble
landlady
went
to
attend
to
something
that
was
boiling
over
on
the
stove
it
was
an
ugly
little
parlor
that
was
to
be
her
for
the
next
year
at
least
with
ingrain
carpet
of
ancient
pattern
hideous
chromos
on
the
walls
and
frantically
common
furniture
setting
up
in
its
shining
varnish
to
be
pretentious
but
the
girl
had
not
seen
it
yet
she
was
filled
with
a
great
homesickness
that
had
not
possessed
her
even
when
she
said
to
her
dear
ones
at
home
she
suddenly
realized
that
the
people
with
whom
she
was
to
be
thrown
were
of
another
world
from
hers
and
this
one
friend
whom
she
had
found
in
the
desert
was
leaving
her
she
tried
to
shake
hands
formally
and
tell
him
how
grateful
she
was
to
him
for
rescuing
her
from
the
perils
of
the
night
but
somehow
words
seemed
so
inadequate
and
tears
kept
crowding
their
way
into
her
throat
and
eyes
absurd
it
was
and
he
a
stranger
twenty
hours
before
and
a
man
of
other
ways
than
hers
besides
yet
he
was
her
friend
and
rescuer
she
spoke
her
thanks
as
well
as
she
could
and
then
looked
up
a
swift
timid
glance
and
found
his
eyes
upon
her
earnestly
and
troubled
do
thank
me
he
said
huskily
i
guess
it
was
the
best
thing
i
ever
did
finding
you
i
forget
even
if
you
never
let
me
see
you
again
and
i
hope
you
will
his
eyes
searched
hers
wistfully
of
course
she
said
why
not
i
thank
you
he
said
in
quaint
courtly
fashion
bending
low
over
her
hand
i
shall
try
to
be
worthy
of
the
honor
and
so
saying
he
left
her
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
away
into
the
lengthening
shadows
of
the
afternoon
she
stood
in
the
forlorn
little
room
staring
out
of
the
window
after
her
late
companion
a
sense
of
utter
desolation
upon
her
for
the
moment
all
her
brave
hopes
of
the
future
had
fled
and
if
she
could
have
slipped
unobserved
out
of
the
front
door
down
to
the
station
and
boarded
some
waiting
express
to
her
home
she
would
gladly
have
done
it
then
and
there
try
as
she
would
to
summon
her
former
reasons
for
coming
to
this
wild
she
could
not
think
of
one
of
them
and
her
eyes
were
very
near
to
tears
but
margaret
earle
was
not
given
to
tears
and
as
she
felt
them
smart
beneath
her
lids
she
turned
in
a
panic
to
prevent
them
she
could
not
afford
to
cry
now
tanner
would
be
returning
and
she
must
not
find
the
new
weeping
with
a
glance
she
swept
the
meager
pretentious
room
and
then
suddenly
became
aware
of
other
presences
in
the
doorway
stood
a
man
and
a
dog
both
regarding
her
intently
with
open
surprise
not
unmixed
with
open
appraisement
and
a
marked
degree
of
admiration
the
man
was
of
medium
height
slight
with
a
putty
complexion
cold
eyes
pale
hair
and
a
look
of
around
his
rather
weak
mouth
he
was
dressed
in
a
city
business
suit
of
the
latest
cut
however
and
looked
as
much
out
of
place
in
that
crude
little
house
as
did
margaret
earle
herself
in
her
simple
gown
of
crêpe
and
her
undeniable
air
of
style
and
good
taste
his
eyes
as
they
regarded
her
had
in
them
a
smile
that
the
girl
instinctively
resented
was
it
a
shade
too
possessive
and
complacently
sure
for
a
stranger
the
dog
a
large
collie
had
great
liquid
brown
eyes
menacing
or
loyal
as
circumstances
dictated
and
regarded
her
with
an
air
of
brief
indecision
she
felt
she
was
being
weighed
in
the
balance
by
both
pairs
of
eyes
of
the
two
the
girl
preferred
the
dog
perhaps
the
dog
understood
for
he
came
a
pace
nearer
and
waved
his
plumy
tail
tentatively
for
the
dog
she
felt
a
glow
of
friendliness
at
once
but
for
the
man
she
suddenly
and
most
unreasonably
of
course
conceived
one
of
her
violent
and
unexpected
dislikes
into
this
tableau
bustled
tanner
well
now
i
did
go
to
leave
you
by
your
lonesome
all
this
time
she
apologized
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
but
them
beans
boiled
clean
over
and
i
hed
to
put
in
a
bigger
kettle
you
see
i
put
in
more
beans
o
you
bein
here
an
i
ai
uset
to
on
two
extry
she
looked
happily
from
the
man
to
the
girl
and
back
again
west
i
o
course
you
interjuced
yerself
bein
a
preacher
you
do
hev
to
stan
on
ceremony
like
the
rest
of
mankind
you
well
let
me
hev
the
pleasure
of
interjucin
our
new
miss
margaret
earle
i
you
two
be
awful
chummy
right
at
the
start
both
bein
from
the
east
that
way
an
both
hevin
ben
to
college
margaret
earle
acknowledged
the
bow
with
a
cool
little
inclination
of
her
head
she
wondered
why
she
did
hate
the
garrulous
woman
who
rattled
on
in
this
happy
way
but
there
was
something
so
innocently
pleased
in
her
manner
that
she
could
help
putting
all
her
wrath
on
the
smiling
man
who
came
forward
instantly
with
a
low
bow
and
a
voice
of
fulsome
flattery
indeed
miss
earle
i
assure
you
i
am
happily
surprised
i
am
sure
tanner
prophecy
will
come
true
and
we
shall
be
the
best
of
friends
when
they
told
me
the
new
teacher
was
to
board
here
i
really
hesitated
i
have
seen
something
of
these
western
teachers
in
my
time
and
scarcely
thought
i
should
find
you
congenial
but
i
can
see
at
a
glance
that
you
are
the
exception
to
the
rule
he
presented
a
soft
unmanly
white
hand
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
take
it
or
seem
rude
to
her
hostess
but
her
manner
was
like
icicles
and
she
was
thankful
she
had
not
yet
removed
her
gloves
if
the
reverend
gentleman
thought
he
was
to
enjoy
a
lingering
he
was
mistaken
for
the
gloved
merely
touched
his
hand
and
were
withdrawn
and
the
girl
turned
to
her
hostess
with
a
smile
of
finality
as
if
he
were
dismissed
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
take
the
hint
and
withdraw
however
until
on
a
sudden
the
great
dog
came
and
stood
between
them
with
welcome
and
joyous
greeting
in
the
plumy
wagging
tail
he
pushed
close
to
her
and
looked
up
into
her
face
insistently
his
hanging
pink
tongue
and
wide
smiling
countenance
proclaiming
that
he
was
satisfied
with
his
investigation
margaret
looked
down
at
him
and
then
stooped
and
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
something
in
his
kindly
dog
expression
made
her
feel
suddenly
as
if
she
had
a
real
friend
it
seemed
the
man
however
did
not
like
the
situation
he
kicked
gingerly
at
the
dog
hind
legs
and
said
in
a
harsh
voice
get
out
of
the
way
sir
you
annoying
the
lady
get
out
i
say
the
dog
however
uttered
a
low
growl
and
merely
showed
the
whites
of
his
menacing
eyes
at
the
man
turning
his
body
slightly
so
that
he
stood
across
the
lady
way
protectingly
as
if
to
keep
the
man
from
her
margaret
smiled
at
the
dog
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
as
if
to
signify
her
acceptance
of
the
friendship
he
had
offered
her
and
he
waved
his
plume
once
more
and
attended
her
from
the
room
neither
of
them
giving
further
attention
to
the
man
confound
that
dog
said
rev
frederick
west
in
a
most
tone
as
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
then
to
himself
he
mused
a
pretty
girl
a
girl
i
really
think
it
be
worth
my
while
to
stay
a
month
at
least
up
in
her
room
the
very
pretty
girl
was
unpacking
her
and
struggling
with
the
tears
not
since
she
was
a
wee
little
girl
and
went
to
school
all
alone
for
the
first
time
had
she
felt
so
very
forlorn
and
it
was
the
little
bare
bedroom
that
had
done
it
at
least
that
had
been
the
final
straw
that
had
made
too
great
the
burden
of
keeping
down
those
threatening
tears
it
was
only
a
bare
plain
room
with
unfinished
walls
rough
woodwork
a
cheap
wooden
bed
a
bureau
with
a
warped
and
on
the
floor
was
a
braided
rug
of
rags
a
little
wooden
rocker
another
small
straight
wooden
chair
a
hanging
decorated
with
purple
roses
a
hanging
bookshelf
composed
of
three
thin
boards
strung
together
with
maroon
picture
cord
a
violently
colored
of
moses
in
the
bulrushes
framed
in
straws
and
red
worsted
and
paper
shades
at
the
windows
that
was
the
room
how
different
from
her
room
at
home
simply
and
sweetly
finished
anew
for
her
from
college
it
rose
before
her
homesick
vision
now
soft
gray
walls
ceiling
blended
by
a
wreath
of
exquisite
wild
roses
whose
pattern
was
repeated
in
the
border
of
the
simple
curtains
and
chair
cushions
furniture
pretty
brass
bed
soft
as
down
in
its
luxurious
mattress
spotless
and
inviting
always
she
glanced
at
the
humpy
bed
with
its
fringed
gray
spread
and
pillows
in
dismay
she
had
not
thought
of
little
discomforts
like
that
yet
how
they
loomed
upon
her
weary
vision
now
the
tiny
wooden
stand
with
its
thick
white
crockery
seemed
ill
substitute
for
the
dainty
white
at
home
she
had
known
she
would
not
have
her
home
luxuries
of
course
but
she
had
not
realized
until
set
down
amid
these
barren
surroundings
what
a
difference
they
would
make
going
to
the
window
and
looking
out
she
saw
for
the
first
tune
the
one
luxury
the
little
room
possessed
a
view
and
such
a
view
wide
and
wonderful
and
far
it
stretched
in
colors
unmatched
by
painter
brush
a
purple
mountain
topped
by
rosy
clouds
in
the
distance
for
the
second
time
in
arizona
her
soul
was
lifted
suddenly
out
of
itself
and
its
dismay
by
a
vision
of
the
things
that
god
has
made
and
the
largeness
of
it
all
chapter
vi
for
some
time
she
stood
and
gazed
marveling
at
the
beauty
and
recalling
some
of
the
things
her
companion
of
the
afternoon
had
said
about
his
impressions
of
the
place
then
suddenly
there
loomed
a
dark
speck
in
the
near
foreground
of
her
meditation
and
looking
down
annoyed
she
discovered
the
minister
like
a
gnat
between
the
eye
and
a
grand
spectacle
his
face
turned
admiringly
up
to
her
window
his
hand
lifted
in
familiar
greeting
vexed
at
his
familiarity
she
turned
quickly
and
jerked
down
the
shade
then
throwing
herself
on
the
bed
she
had
a
good
cry
her
nerves
were
terribly
wrought
up
things
seemed
twisted
in
her
mind
and
she
felt
that
she
had
reached
the
limit
of
her
endurance
here
was
she
margaret
earle
newly
elected
teacher
to
the
ashland
ridge
school
lying
on
her
bed
in
tears
when
she
ought
to
be
getting
settled
and
planning
her
new
life
when
the
situation
demanded
her
best
attention
she
was
wrought
up
over
a
foolish
little
personal
dislike
why
did
she
have
to
dislike
a
minister
anyway
and
then
take
to
a
wild
young
fellow
whose
life
thus
far
had
been
anything
but
satisfactory
even
to
himself
was
it
her
perverse
nature
that
caused
her
to
remember
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
boy
who
had
rescued
her
from
a
night
in
the
wilderness
and
to
feel
there
was
far
more
manliness
in
his
face
than
in
the
face
of
the
man
whose
profession
surely
would
lead
one
to
suppose
he
was
more
worthy
of
her
respect
and
interest
well
she
was
tired
perhaps
things
would
assume
their
normal
relation
to
one
another
in
the
morning
and
so
after
a
few
minutes
she
bathed
her
face
in
the
little
heavy
combed
her
hair
and
freshened
the
collar
and
ruffles
in
her
sleeves
preparatory
to
going
down
for
the
evening
meal
then
with
a
swift
thought
she
searched
through
her
for
every
available
article
wherewith
to
brighten
that
forlorn
room
the
dainty
of
dresden
silk
with
rosy
ribbons
that
her
girl
friends
at
home
had
given
as
a
parting
gift
covered
a
generous
portion
of
the
pine
bureau
and
when
she
had
spread
it
out
and
bestowed
its
brushes
combs
and
pretty
sachet
things
seemed
to
brighten
up
a
bit
she
hung
up
a
cobweb
of
a
lace
boudoir
cap
with
its
ribbons
over
the
bleary
mirror
threw
her
kimono
of
flowered
challis
over
the
back
of
the
rocker
arranged
her
soap
and
toothbrush
her
own
and
a
towel
brought
from
home
on
the
and
somehow
felt
better
and
more
as
if
she
belonged
last
she
ranged
her
precious
photographs
of
father
and
mother
and
the
dear
church
and
manse
across
in
front
of
the
mirror
when
her
trunks
came
there
would
be
other
things
and
she
could
bear
it
perhaps
when
she
had
this
room
buried
deep
in
the
home
belongings
but
this
would
have
to
do
for
for
the
trunk
might
not
come
till
morning
and
anyhow
she
was
too
weary
to
unpack
she
ventured
one
more
look
out
of
her
window
peering
carefully
at
first
to
make
sure
her
was
not
still
standing
down
below
on
the
grass
a
pang
of
compunction
shot
through
her
conscience
what
would
her
dear
father
think
of
her
feeling
this
way
toward
a
minister
and
before
she
knew
the
first
thing
about
him
too
it
was
dreadful
she
must
shake
it
off
of
course
he
was
a
good
man
or
he
would
be
in
the
ministry
and
she
had
doubtless
mistaken
mere
friendliness
for
forwardness
she
would
forget
it
and
try
to
go
down
and
behave
to
him
the
way
her
father
would
want
her
to
behave
toward
a
cautiously
she
raised
the
shade
again
and
looked
out
the
mountain
was
bathed
in
a
wonderful
ruby
light
fading
into
amethyst
and
all
the
path
between
was
like
a
pavement
of
jewels
set
in
filigree
while
she
looked
the
picture
changed
glowed
softened
and
changed
again
making
her
think
of
the
chapter
about
the
holy
city
in
revelation
she
started
at
last
when
some
one
knocked
hesitatingly
on
the
door
for
the
wonderful
sunset
light
had
made
her
forget
for
the
moment
where
she
was
and
it
seemed
a
desecration
to
have
mere
mortals
step
in
and
announce
supper
although
the
odor
of
pork
and
cabbage
had
been
proclaiming
it
dumbly
for
some
time
she
went
to
the
door
and
opening
it
found
a
dark
figure
standing
in
the
hall
for
a
minute
she
half
feared
it
was
the
minister
until
a
shy
reluctant
backwardness
in
the
whole
stocky
figure
and
the
stirring
of
a
large
furry
creature
just
behind
him
made
her
sure
it
was
not
ma
says
you
to
come
to
supper
said
a
gruff
untamed
voice
and
margaret
perceived
that
the
person
in
the
gathering
gloom
of
the
hall
was
a
boy
oh
said
margaret
with
relief
in
her
voice
thank
you
for
coming
to
tell
me
i
meant
to
come
down
and
not
give
that
trouble
but
i
got
to
looking
at
the
wonderful
sunset
have
you
been
watching
it
she
pointed
across
the
room
to
the
window
look
is
that
a
great
color
there
on
the
tip
of
the
mountain
i
never
saw
anything
like
that
at
home
i
suppose
you
used
to
it
though
the
boy
came
a
step
nearer
the
door
and
looked
blankly
half
wonderingly
across
at
the
window
as
if
he
expected
to
see
some
phenomenon
oh
he
exclaimed
carelessly
sure
we
have
them
all
the
time
but
that
wonderful
silver
light
pouring
down
just
in
that
one
tiny
spot
exclaimed
margaret
it
makes
the
mountain
seem
alive
and
smiling
the
boy
turned
and
looked
at
her
curiously
gee
said
he
i
show
you
plenty
like
that
but
he
turned
and
looked
at
it
a
long
lingering
minute
again
but
we
must
keep
your
mother
waiting
said
margaret
remembering
and
turning
reluctantly
toward
the
door
is
this
your
dog
is
he
a
beauty
he
made
me
feel
really
as
if
he
were
glad
to
see
me
she
stooped
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
dog
head
and
smiled
brightly
up
at
his
master
the
boy
face
lit
with
a
smile
and
he
turned
a
keen
appreciative
look
at
the
new
teacher
for
the
first
time
genuinely
interested
in
her
cap
a
good
old
scout
he
admitted
so
his
name
is
cap
is
that
short
for
anything
captain
what
a
good
name
for
him
he
looks
as
if
he
were
a
captain
and
he
waves
that
tail
grandly
almost
as
if
it
might
be
a
badge
of
office
but
who
are
you
you
have
told
me
your
name
yet
are
you
tanner
son
the
boy
nodded
i
just
bud
tanner
then
you
are
one
of
my
pupils
are
you
we
must
shake
hands
on
that
she
put
out
her
hand
but
she
was
forced
to
go
out
after
reluctant
red
fist
take
it
by
force
in
a
strange
grasp
and
do
all
the
shaking
for
bud
had
never
had
that
experience
before
in
his
life
and
he
emerged
from
it
with
a
very
red
face
and
a
feeling
as
if
his
right
arm
had
been
somehow
lifted
out
of
the
same
class
with
the
rest
of
his
body
it
was
rather
awful
too
that
it
happened
just
in
the
open
door
and
that
watched
the
whole
performance
bud
put
on
an
frown
and
shuffled
away
from
the
teacher
making
a
great
show
of
putting
cap
out
of
the
though
he
always
sat
behind
his
master
chair
at
meals
much
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
male
boarder
who
was
slightly
in
awe
of
his
dogship
not
having
been
admitted
into
friendship
as
the
lady
had
been
west
stood
back
of
his
chair
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
new
boarder
an
expectant
smile
on
his
face
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
much
the
same
effect
as
a
wolf
licking
his
lips
in
anticipation
of
a
victim
in
spite
of
her
resolves
to
like
the
man
margaret
was
again
struck
with
aversion
as
she
saw
him
standing
there
and
was
intensely
relieved
when
she
found
that
the
seat
assigned
to
her
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
from
him
and
beside
bud
west
however
did
not
seem
to
be
pleased
with
the
arrangement
and
stepping
around
the
table
said
to
his
landlady
did
you
mean
me
to
sit
over
here
and
he
placed
a
possessive
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
that
was
meant
for
bud
no
mister
west
you
jest
set
where
you
ben
settin
responded
tanner
she
had
thought
the
matter
all
out
and
decided
that
the
minister
could
converse
with
the
teacher
to
the
better
advantage
of
the
whole
table
if
he
sat
across
from
her
tanner
was
a
born
this
she
felt
was
an
opportunity
not
to
be
despised
even
if
it
sometime
robbed
the
ridge
school
of
a
desirable
teacher
but
west
did
not
immediately
return
to
his
place
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
to
margaret
extreme
annoyance
he
drew
her
chair
and
waited
for
her
to
sit
down
the
situation
however
was
somewhat
relieved
of
its
intimacy
by
a
sudden
interference
from
cap
who
darted
away
from
his
frowning
master
and
stepped
up
authoritatively
to
the
minister
side
with
a
low
growl
as
if
to
say
hands
off
that
chair
that
does
belong
to
you
west
suddenly
released
his
hold
on
the
chair
without
waiting
to
shove
it
up
to
the
table
and
precipitately
retired
to
his
own
place
that
dog
a
nuisance
he
said
testily
and
was
answered
with
a
glare
from
bud
dark
eyes
bud
came
to
his
seat
with
his
eyes
still
set
savagely
on
the
minister
and
cap
settled
down
protectingly
behind
margaret
chair
tanner
bustled
in
with
the
and
tanner
came
last
having
just
finished
his
rather
elaborate
at
the
kitchen
glass
with
the
kitchen
comb
in
full
view
of
the
assembled
multitude
he
was
a
little
thin
wiry
man
with
skin
like
leather
and
sparse
hair
some
of
his
teeth
were
missing
leaving
deep
hollows
in
his
cheeks
and
his
kindly
protruding
chin
was
covered
with
scraggy
gray
whiskers
which
stuck
out
ahead
of
him
like
a
he
was
in
his
and
collarless
but
looked
neat
and
clean
and
he
greeted
the
new
guest
heartily
before
he
sat
down
and
nodded
to
the
minister
naow
brother
west
i
reckon
we
ready
fer
your
part
o
the
performance
you
please
to
say
grace
west
bowed
his
sleek
yellow
head
and
muttered
a
formal
blessing
with
an
offhand
manner
as
if
it
were
a
mere
ceremony
bud
stared
contemptuously
at
him
the
while
and
cap
uttered
a
low
rumble
as
of
a
distant
growl
margaret
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
laugh
and
tried
to
control
herself
wondering
what
her
father
would
feel
about
it
all
the
genial
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
broke
the
stiffness
after
the
blessing
tanner
bustled
back
and
forth
from
the
stove
to
the
table
talking
clamorously
the
while
tanner
joined
in
with
his
flat
nasal
twang
responding
and
the
minister
with
an
air
of
utter
contempt
for
them
both
endeavored
to
set
up
a
separate
and
altogether
private
conversation
with
margaret
across
the
narrow
table
but
margaret
innocently
had
begun
a
conversation
with
bud
about
the
school
and
had
to
be
addressed
by
name
each
time
before
west
could
get
her
attention
bud
with
a
boy
keenness
noticed
her
aversion
and
put
aside
his
own
backwardness
entering
into
the
contest
with
remarkably
voluble
replies
the
minister
if
he
would
be
in
the
talk
at
all
was
forced
to
join
in
with
theirs
and
found
himself
worsted
and
contradicted
by
the
boy
at
every
turn
strange
to
say
however
this
state
of
things
only
served
to
make
the
man
more
eager
to
talk
with
the
lady
she
was
not
anxious
for
his
attention
ah
she
was
coy
and
the
acquaintance
was
to
have
the
zest
of
being
no
lightly
won
friendship
all
the
better
he
watched
her
as
she
talked
noted
every
charm
of
lash
and
lid
and
curving
lip
stared
so
continually
that
she
finally
gave
up
looking
his
way
at
all
even
when
she
was
obliged
to
answer
his
questions
thus
at
last
the
first
meal
in
the
new
home
was
concluded
and
margaret
pleading
excessive
weariness
went
to
her
room
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
endure
another
of
contact
with
her
present
world
until
she
had
had
some
rest
if
the
world
had
been
just
bud
and
the
dog
she
could
have
stayed
below
stairs
and
found
out
a
little
more
about
the
new
life
but
with
that
minister
continually
butting
in
her
soul
was
in
a
tumult
when
she
had
prepared
for
rest
she
put
out
her
light
and
drew
up
the
shade
there
before
her
spread
the
wide
wonder
of
the
heavens
again
with
the
soft
purple
of
the
mountain
under
stars
and
she
was
carried
back
to
the
experience
of
the
night
before
with
a
vivid
memory
of
her
companion
why
just
could
she
be
as
interested
in
the
minister
down
there
as
in
the
wild
young
man
well
she
was
too
tired
to
analyze
it
all
and
she
knelt
beside
her
window
in
the
starlight
to
pray
as
she
prayed
her
thoughts
were
on
lance
gardley
once
more
and
she
felt
her
heart
go
out
in
longing
for
him
that
he
might
find
a
way
to
make
good
whatever
his
trouble
had
been
as
she
rose
to
retire
she
heard
a
step
below
and
looking
down
saw
the
minister
stalking
back
and
forth
in
the
yard
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
thrown
back
raptly
he
could
not
see
her
in
her
dark
room
but
she
pulled
the
shade
down
softly
and
fled
to
her
hard
little
bed
was
that
man
going
to
obsess
her
vision
everywhere
and
must
she
try
to
like
him
just
because
he
was
a
minister
so
at
last
she
fell
asleep
chapter
vii
the
next
day
was
filled
with
unpacking
and
with
writing
letters
home
by
dint
of
being
very
busy
margaret
managed
to
forget
the
minister
who
seemed
to
obtrude
himself
at
every
possible
turn
of
the
day
and
would
have
monopolized
her
if
she
had
given
him
half
a
chance
the
trunks
two
delightful
steamer
ones
and
a
big
with
her
books
arrived
the
next
morning
and
caused
great
excitement
in
the
household
not
since
they
moved
into
the
new
house
had
they
seen
so
many
things
arrive
bud
helped
carry
them
while
cap
ran
wildly
back
and
forth
giving
sharp
barks
and
the
minister
stood
by
the
front
door
and
gave
ineffectual
and
unpractical
advice
to
the
man
who
had
brought
them
margaret
heard
the
man
and
bud
exchanging
their
opinion
of
west
in
low
growls
in
the
hall
as
they
entered
her
door
and
she
could
help
feeling
that
she
agreed
with
them
though
she
might
not
have
expressed
her
opinion
in
the
same
terms
the
minister
tapped
at
her
door
a
little
later
and
offered
his
services
in
opening
her
box
and
unstrapping
her
trunks
but
she
told
him
bud
had
already
performed
that
service
for
her
and
thanked
him
with
a
finality
that
forbade
him
to
linger
she
half
hoped
he
heard
the
vicious
little
click
with
which
she
locked
the
door
after
him
and
then
wondered
if
she
were
wicked
to
feel
that
way
but
all
such
compunctions
were
presently
forgotten
in
the
work
of
making
over
her
room
the
trunks
after
they
were
unpacked
and
repacked
with
the
things
she
would
not
need
at
once
were
disposed
in
front
of
the
two
windows
with
which
the
ugly
little
room
was
blessed
she
covered
them
with
two
bagdad
rugs
relics
of
her
college
days
and
piled
several
college
pillows
from
the
on
each
which
made
the
room
instantly
assume
a
homelike
air
then
out
of
the
box
came
other
things
framed
pictures
of
home
scenes
college
friends
and
places
pennants
and
flags
from
football
baseball
and
games
she
had
attended
photographs
a
few
prints
of
rare
paintings
simply
framed
a
roll
of
white
scrim
like
her
curtains
at
home
wherewith
she
transformed
the
windows
and
the
stiff
little
wooden
rocker
and
even
made
a
valance
and
over
pink
cambric
for
her
bed
the
bureau
and
were
given
pink
and
white
covers
and
the
ugly
walls
literally
disappeared
beneath
pictures
pennants
banners
and
symbols
when
bud
came
up
to
call
her
to
dinner
she
flung
the
door
open
and
he
paused
in
amazement
over
the
transformation
his
eyes
kindled
at
a
pair
of
a
a
and
a
big
in
the
corner
and
his
whole
look
of
surprise
was
so
ridiculous
that
she
had
to
laugh
he
looked
as
if
a
miracle
had
been
performed
on
the
room
and
actually
stepped
back
into
the
hall
to
get
his
breath
and
be
sure
he
was
still
in
his
father
house
i
want
you
to
come
in
and
see
all
my
pictures
and
get
acquainted
with
my
friends
when
you
have
time
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
could
make
some
more
shelves
for
my
books
and
help
me
unpack
and
set
them
up
sure
gasped
bud
heartily
albeit
with
awe
she
had
asked
the
minister
she
had
asked
just
a
boy
he
looked
around
the
room
with
anticipation
what
wonder
and
delight
he
would
have
looking
at
all
those
things
then
cap
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
room
as
if
he
belonged
mouth
open
tongue
lolling
smiling
and
panting
a
hearty
approval
as
he
looked
about
at
the
strangeness
for
all
the
world
as
a
human
being
might
have
done
it
was
plain
he
was
pleased
with
the
change
there
was
a
proprietary
air
about
bud
during
dinner
that
was
pleasant
to
margaret
and
most
annoying
to
west
it
was
plain
that
west
looked
on
the
boy
as
an
upstart
whom
miss
earle
was
using
for
the
present
to
block
his
approach
and
he
was
growing
most
impatient
over
the
delay
he
suggested
that
perhaps
she
would
like
his
escort
to
see
something
of
her
surroundings
that
afternoon
but
she
smilingly
told
him
that
she
would
be
very
busy
all
the
afternoon
getting
settled
and
when
he
offered
again
to
help
her
she
cast
a
dazzling
smile
on
bud
and
said
she
think
she
would
need
any
more
help
that
bud
was
going
to
do
a
few
things
for
her
and
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
bud
straightened
up
and
became
two
inches
taller
he
passed
the
bread
suggested
two
pieces
of
pie
and
filled
her
glass
of
water
as
if
she
were
his
partner
tanner
beamed
to
see
his
son
in
high
favor
but
tanner
looked
a
little
troubled
for
the
minister
she
thought
things
were
just
progressing
as
fast
as
they
ought
to
between
him
and
the
teacher
bud
with
margaret
instructions
managed
to
make
a
very
creditable
bookcase
out
of
the
sawed
in
half
the
pieces
set
side
by
side
she
covered
them
deftly
with
green
burlap
left
over
from
college
days
like
her
other
supplies
and
then
the
two
arranged
the
books
bud
was
delighted
over
the
prospect
of
reading
some
of
the
books
for
they
were
not
all
by
any
means
and
she
had
brought
plenty
of
them
to
keep
her
from
being
lonesome
on
days
when
she
longed
to
fly
back
to
her
home
at
last
the
work
was
done
and
they
stood
back
to
survey
it
the
books
filled
up
every
speck
of
space
and
overflowed
to
the
three
little
hanging
shelves
over
them
but
they
were
all
squeezed
in
at
last
except
a
pile
of
that
were
saved
out
to
take
to
the
margaret
set
a
tiny
vase
on
the
top
of
one
part
of
the
and
a
small
brass
bowl
on
the
top
of
the
other
and
bud
after
a
knowing
glance
scurried
away
for
a
few
minutes
and
brought
back
a
handful
of
gorgeous
cactus
blossoms
to
give
the
final
touch
gee
he
said
admiringly
looking
around
the
room
gee
you
know
it
fer
the
same
place
that
evening
after
supper
margaret
sat
down
to
write
a
long
letter
home
she
had
written
a
brief
letter
of
course
the
night
before
but
had
been
too
weary
to
go
into
detail
the
letter
read
dear
mother
and
father
i
unpacked
and
settled
at
last
in
my
room
and
now
i
ca
stand
it
another
minute
till
i
talk
to
you
last
night
of
course
i
was
pretty
homesick
things
all
looked
so
strange
and
new
and
different
i
had
known
they
would
but
then
i
did
realize
at
all
how
different
they
would
be
but
i
not
getting
homesick
already
do
think
it
i
not
a
bit
sorry
i
came
or
at
least
i
be
when
i
get
started
in
school
one
of
the
scholars
is
tanner
son
and
i
like
him
he
crude
of
course
but
he
has
a
brain
and
he
been
helping
me
this
afternoon
we
made
a
bookcase
for
my
books
and
it
looks
fine
i
wish
you
could
see
it
i
covered
it
with
the
green
burlap
and
the
books
look
real
happy
in
smiling
rows
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
bud
tanner
got
me
some
wonderful
cactus
blossoms
for
my
brass
bowl
i
wish
i
could
send
you
some
they
are
gorgeous
but
you
will
want
me
to
tell
about
my
arrival
well
to
begin
with
i
was
late
getting
here
margaret
had
decided
to
leave
out
the
incident
of
the
desert
altogether
for
she
knew
by
experience
that
her
mother
would
suffer
terrors
all
during
her
absence
if
she
once
heard
of
that
wild
adventure
which
accounts
for
the
lateness
of
the
telegram
i
sent
you
i
hope
its
delay
did
make
you
worry
any
a
very
nice
young
man
named
gardley
piloted
me
to
house
and
looked
after
my
trunks
for
me
he
is
from
the
east
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
he
happened
along
for
he
was
most
kind
and
gentlemanly
and
helpful
tell
jane
not
to
worry
lest
i
fall
in
love
with
him
he
does
live
here
he
belongs
to
a
ranch
or
camp
or
something
miles
away
she
was
so
afraid
fall
in
love
with
an
arizona
man
and
not
come
back
home
tanner
is
very
kind
and
motherly
according
to
her
lights
she
has
given
me
the
best
room
in
the
house
and
she
talks
a
blue
streak
she
has
thin
brown
hair
turning
gray
and
she
wears
it
in
a
funny
little
knob
on
the
of
her
round
head
to
correspond
with
the
funny
little
tuft
of
hair
on
her
husband
protruding
chin
her
head
is
set
on
her
neck
like
a
only
she
is
squattier
than
a
she
always
wears
her
sleeves
rolled
up
at
least
so
far
she
has
and
she
always
bustles
around
noisily
and
apologizes
for
everything
in
the
jolliest
sort
of
way
i
would
like
her
i
guess
if
it
was
for
the
other
boarder
but
she
has
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
i
shall
like
him
and
i
do
of
course
so
she
is
a
bit
disappointed
in
me
so
far
tanner
is
very
kind
and
funny
and
looks
something
like
a
with
the
blades
he
never
disagrees
with
tanner
and
i
really
believe
he
in
love
with
her
yet
though
they
must
have
been
married
a
good
while
he
calls
her
ma
and
seems
restless
unless
she
in
the
room
when
she
goes
out
to
the
kitchen
to
get
some
more
soup
or
hash
or
bring
in
the
pie
he
shouts
remarks
at
her
all
the
time
she
gone
and
she
answers
utterly
regardless
of
the
conversation
the
rest
of
the
family
are
carrying
on
it
like
a
phonograph
wound
up
for
the
day
bud
tanner
is
about
fourteen
and
i
like
him
he
well
developed
strong
and
almost
handsome
at
least
he
would
be
if
he
were
fixed
up
a
little
he
has
fine
dark
eyes
and
a
great
shock
of
dark
hair
he
and
i
are
friends
already
and
so
is
the
dog
the
dog
is
a
peach
excuse
me
mother
but
i
just
must
use
a
little
of
the
dear
old
college
slang
somewhere
and
your
letters
are
the
only
for
i
a
schoolmarm
now
and
must
talk
good
and
proper
all
the
time
you
know
the
dog
name
is
captain
and
he
looks
the
part
he
has
constituted
himself
my
bodyguard
and
it
going
to
be
very
nice
having
him
he
perfectly
devoted
already
he
a
great
big
fluffy
fellow
with
keen
intelligent
eyes
sensitive
ears
and
a
tail
like
a
spreading
plume
you
love
him
i
know
he
has
a
smile
like
the
morning
sunshine
and
now
i
come
to
the
only
other
member
of
the
family
the
boarder
and
i
hesitate
to
approach
the
topic
because
i
have
taken
one
of
my
violent
and
naughty
dislikes
to
him
and
awful
thought
mother
father
a
minister
yes
he
a
i
know
it
will
make
you
feel
dreadfully
and
i
thought
some
of
not
telling
you
but
my
conscience
hurt
me
so
i
had
to
i
just
him
so
there
of
course
i
may
get
over
it
but
i
do
see
how
ever
for
i
ca
think
of
anything
that
more
like
him
than
oh
yes
there
is
one
other
word
grandmother
used
to
use
it
about
men
she
had
any
use
for
and
that
was
squash
mother
i
ca
help
it
but
he
does
seem
something
like
a
squash
one
of
that
yellow
kind
with
warts
all
over
it
and
a
great
big
splurgy
vine
behind
it
to
account
for
its
being
there
at
all
insipid
and
thready
when
it
cooked
you
know
and
has
to
have
a
lot
of
salt
and
pepper
and
butter
to
make
it
go
down
at
all
now
i
told
you
the
worst
and
i
try
to
describe
him
and
see
what
you
think
i
better
do
about
it
oh
he
is
the
regular
minister
here
or
missionary
i
guess
they
call
him
he
located
quite
a
distance
off
and
only
comes
once
a
month
to
preach
here
and
anyhow
gone
east
now
to
take
his
wife
to
a
hospital
for
an
operation
and
wo
be
back
for
a
couple
of
months
perhaps
and
this
man
is
even
taking
his
place
he
just
here
for
his
health
or
for
fun
or
something
i
guess
he
says
he
had
a
large
suburban
church
near
new
york
and
had
a
nervous
breakdown
but
i
been
wondering
if
he
did
make
a
mistake
and
it
the
church
had
the
nervous
breakdown
instead
he
is
very
big
nor
very
little
he
just
insignificant
his
hair
is
like
wet
straw
and
his
eyes
like
a
fish
his
hand
feels
like
a
dead
toad
when
you
have
to
shake
hands
which
i
thankful
does
have
to
be
done
but
once
he
looks
at
you
with
a
flat
sickening
grin
he
has
an
acquired
double
chin
acquired
to
make
him
look
pompous
and
he
dresses
stylishly
and
speaks
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
with
contempt
he
wants
to
be
very
affable
and
offers
to
take
me
to
all
sorts
of
places
but
so
far
i
avoided
him
i
ca
think
how
they
ever
came
to
let
him
be
a
minister
i
really
ca
and
yet
i
suppose
it
all
my
horrid
old
prejudice
and
father
will
be
grieved
and
you
will
think
i
am
perverse
but
really
i
sure
he
not
one
bit
like
father
was
when
he
was
young
i
never
saw
a
minister
like
him
perhaps
i
get
over
it
i
do
sometimes
you
know
so
do
begin
to
worry
yet
i
try
real
hard
i
suppose
he
preach
sunday
and
then
perhaps
his
sermon
will
be
grand
and
i
forget
how
he
looks
and
think
only
of
his
great
thoughts
but
i
know
it
will
be
a
sort
of
comfort
to
you
to
know
that
there
is
a
presbyterian
minister
in
the
house
with
me
and
i
really
try
to
like
him
if
i
can
there
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
board
it
is
luxurious
of
course
but
i
did
expect
that
everything
is
very
plain
but
tanner
manages
to
make
it
taste
good
she
makes
fine
almost
as
good
as
yours
not
quite
my
room
is
all
lovely
now
that
i
have
covered
its
bareness
with
my
own
things
but
it
has
one
great
thing
that
ca
compare
with
anything
at
home
and
that
is
its
view
it
is
wonderful
i
wish
i
could
make
you
see
it
there
is
a
mountain
at
the
end
of
it
that
has
as
many
different
garments
as
a
queen
when
sunset
came
it
grew
filmy
as
if
a
gauze
of
many
colors
had
dropped
upon
it
and
melted
into
it
and
glowed
and
melted
until
it
turned
to
slate
blue
under
the
wide
starred
blue
of
the
wonderful
night
sky
and
all
the
dark
about
was
velvet
last
night
my
mountain
was
all
pink
and
silver
and
i
have
seen
it
purple
and
rose
but
you
think
the
wideness
of
the
sky
and
i
could
paint
it
for
you
with
words
you
must
see
it
to
understand
a
great
wide
dark
sapphire
floor
just
simply
ravished
with
stars
like
big
jewels
but
i
must
stop
and
go
to
bed
for
i
find
the
air
of
this
country
makes
me
very
sleepy
and
my
wicked
little
is
smoking
i
guess
you
would
better
send
me
my
after
all
for
i
surely
going
to
need
it
now
i
must
turn
out
the
light
and
say
good
night
to
my
mountain
and
then
i
will
go
to
sleep
thinking
of
you
do
worry
about
the
minister
i
very
polite
to
him
but
i
shall
never
fall
in
love

your
loving
little
girl
margaret
chapter
viii
margaret
had
arranged
with
bud
to
take
her
to
the
the
next
morning
and
he
had
promised
to
have
a
horse
hitched
up
and
ready
at
ten
as
it
seemed
the
school
was
a
magnificent
distance
from
her
in
fact
everything
seemed
to
be
located
with
a
view
to
being
as
far
from
everywhere
else
as
possible
even
the
town
was
scattering
and
widespread
and
sparse
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
she
was
disappointed
to
find
that
bud
was
not
there
and
she
was
obliged
to
suffer
a
breakfast
with
west
by
dint
however
of
asking
him
questions
instead
of
allowing
him
to
take
the
initiative
she
hurried
through
her
breakfast
quite
successfully
acquiring
a
superficial
knowledge
of
her
quite
distant
and
satisfactory
she
knew
where
he
spent
his
college
days
and
at
what
theological
seminary
he
had
prepared
for
the
ministry
he
had
served
three
years
in
a
prosperous
church
of
a
fat
little
suburb
of
new
york
and
was
taking
a
winter
off
from
his
severe
strenuous
pastoral
labors
to
recuperate
his
strength
get
a
new
stock
of
sermons
ready
and
possibly
to
write
a
book
of
some
of
his
experiences
he
flattened
his
weak
pink
chin
learnedly
as
he
said
this
and
tried
to
look
at
her
impressively
he
said
that
he
should
probably
take
a
large
city
church
as
his
next
pastorate
when
his
health
was
fully
recuperated
he
had
come
out
to
study
the
west
and
enjoy
its
freedom
as
he
understood
it
was
a
good
place
to
rest
and
do
as
you
please
unhampered
by
what
people
thought
he
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
from
churches
and
things
clerical
as
possible
he
felt
it
was
due
himself
and
his
work
that
he
should
he
spoke
of
the
people
he
had
met
in
arizona
as
a
kind
of
tamed
savages
and
tanner
sitting
behind
her
for
a
moment
between
bustles
heard
his
comments
meekly
and
looked
at
him
with
awe
what
a
great
man
he
must
be
and
how
fortunate
for
the
new
teacher
that
he
should
be
there
when
she
came
margaret
drew
a
breath
of
relief
as
she
hurried
away
from
the
to
her
room
she
was
really
anticipating
the
ride
to
the
school
with
bud
she
liked
boys
and
bud
had
taken
her
fancy
but
when
she
came
with
her
hat
and
sweater
on
she
found
west
standing
out
in
front
holding
the
horse
bud
had
to
go
in
another
direction
miss
earle
he
said
touching
his
hat
gracefully
and
he
has
delegated
to
me
the
pleasant
task
of
driving
you
to
the
school
dismay
filled
margaret
soul
and
rage
with
young
bud
he
had
deserted
her
and
left
her
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
she
had
thought
he
understood
well
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
with
this
man
much
as
she
disliked
it
her
father
daughter
could
not
be
rude
to
a
minister
she
climbed
into
the
buckboard
quickly
to
get
the
ceremony
over
for
her
escort
was
inclined
to
be
too
officious
about
helping
her
in
and
somehow
she
could
bear
to
have
him
touch
her
why
was
it
that
she
felt
so
about
him
of
course
he
must
be
a
good
man
west
made
a
serious
mistake
at
the
very
outset
of
that
ride
he
took
it
for
granted
that
all
girls
like
flattery
and
he
proceeded
to
try
it
on
margaret
but
margaret
did
not
enjoy
being
told
how
delighted
he
was
to
find
that
instead
of
the
loud
bold
old
maid
he
had
expected
she
had
turned
out
to
be
so
beautiful
and
young
and
altogether
congenial
and
coolly
ignoring
his
compliments
she
began
a
fire
of
questions
again
she
asked
about
the
country
because
that
was
the
most
obvious
topic
of
conversation
what
plants
were
those
that
grew
by
the
wayside
she
found
he
knew
greasewood
from
and
that
was
about
all
to
some
of
her
questions
he
hazarded
answers
that
were
absurd
in
the
light
of
the
explanations
given
her
by
gardley
two
days
before
however
she
reflected
that
he
had
been
in
the
country
but
a
short
time
and
that
he
was
by
nature
a
man
not
interested
in
such
topics
she
tried
religious
matters
thinking
that
here
at
least
they
must
have
common
interests
she
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
christianity
in
the
west
as
compared
with
the
east
did
he
find
these
western
people
more
alive
and
awake
to
the
things
of
the
kingdom
west
gave
a
startled
look
at
the
clear
profile
of
the
young
woman
beside
him
thought
he
perceived
that
she
was
testing
him
on
his
clerical
side
flattened
his
chin
in
his
most
learned
manner
cleared
his
throat
and
put
on
wisdom
well
now
miss
earle
he
began
condescendingly
i
really
do
know
that
i
have
thought
much
about
the
matter
ah
you
know
i
have
been
resting
absolutely
and
i
really
have
had
opportunity
to
study
the
situation
out
here
in
detail
but
on
the
whole
i
should
say
that
everything
was
decidedly
primitive
yes
ah
i
might
say
ah
well
crude
yes
in
the
extreme
why
take
it
in
this
mission
district
the
missionary
who
is
in
charge
seems
to
be
teaching
the
most
absurd
of
the
old
dogmas
such
as
our
forefathers
used
to
teach
i
have
met
him
of
course
he
is
in
the
east
with
his
wife
for
a
time
i
am
told
she
had
to
go
under
some
kind
of
an
operation
i
have
never
met
him
and
really
do
care
to
do
so
but
to
judge
from
all
i
hear
he
is
a
most
unfit
man
for
a
position
of
the
kind
for
example
he
is
teaching
such
exploded
doctrines
as
the
old
view
of
the
atonement
the
infallibility
of
the
scriptures
the
deity
of
christ
belief
in
miracles
and
the
like
of
course
in
one
sense
it
really
matters
very
little
what
the
poor
indians
believe
or
what
such
people
as
the
tanners
are
taught
they
have
but
little
mind
and
would
scarcely
know
the
difference
but
you
can
readily
see
that
with
such
a
primitive
unenlightened
man
at
the
head
of
religious
affairs
there
could
scarcely
be
much
broadening
and
real
religious
growth
ignorance
of
course
holds
sway
out
here
i
fancy
you
will
find
that
to
be
the
case
soon
enough
what
in
the
world
ever
led
you
to
come
to
a
field
like
this
to
labor
surely
there
must
have
been
many
more
congenial
places
open
to
such
as
you
he
leaned
forward
and
cast
a
sentimental
glance
at
her
his
eyes
looking
more
fishy
than
ever
i
came
out
here
because
i
wanted
to
get
acquainted
with
this
great
country
and
because
i
thought
there
was
an
opportunity
to
do
good
said
margaret
coldly
she
did
not
care
to
discuss
her
own
affairs
with
this
man
but
west
i
do
know
that
i
altogether
understand
you
did
you
tell
me
that
you
were
a
presbyterian
minister
i
certainly
did
he
answered
complacently
as
though
he
were
honoring
the
whole
great
body
of
presbyterians
by
making
the
statement
well
then
what
in
the
world
did
you
mean
all
presbyterians
of
course
believe
in
the
infallibility
of
the
scriptures
and
the
deity
of
jesus
and
the
atonement
not
necessarily
answered
the
young
man
loftily
you
will
find
my
dear
young
lady
that
there
is
a
wide
growing
feeling
in
our
church
in
favor
of
a
broader
view
the
younger
men
and
the
great
student
body
of
our
church
have
thrown
to
the
winds
all
their
former
beliefs
and
are
ready
to
accept
new
light
with
open
minds
the
findings
of
science
have
opened
up
a
vast
store
of
knowledge
and
all
thinking
men
must
acknowledge
that
the
old
dogmas
are
rapidly
vanishing
away
your
father
doubtless
still
holds
to
the
old
faith
perhaps
and
we
must
be
lenient
with
the
older
men
who
have
done
the
best
they
could
with
the
light
they
had
but
all
younger
men
are
coming
to
the
new
way
of
looking
at
things
we
have
had
enough
of
the
days
of
preaching
and
damnation
we
need
a
religion
of
love
to
man
and
good
works
you
should
read
some
of
the
books
that
have
been
written
on
this
subject
if
you
care
to
understand
i
really
think
it
would
be
worth
your
while
you
look
to
me
like
a
young
woman
with
a
mind
i
have
a
few
of
the
latest
with
me
i
shall
be
glad
to
read
and
discuss
them
with
you
if
you
are
interested
thank
you
west
said
margaret
coolly
though
her
eyes
burned
with
battle
i
think
i
have
probably
read
most
of
those
books
and
discussed
them
with
my
father
he
may
be
old
but
he
is
not
without
as
you
call
it
and
he
always
believed
in
knowing
all
that
the
other
side
was
saying
he
brought
me
up
to
look
into
these
things
for
myself
and
anyhow
i
should
not
care
to
read
and
discuss
any
of
these
subjects
with
a
man
who
denies
the
deity
of
my
saviour
and
does
not
believe
in
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
it
seems
to
me
you
have
nothing
left
ah
well
now
my
dear
young
lady
you
must
misjudge
me
i
should
be
sorry
indeed
to
shake
your
faith
for
an
innocent
faith
is
of
course
a
most
beautiful
thing
even
though
it
may
be
unfounded
indeed
west
that
would
not
be
possible
you
could
not
shake
my
faith
in
my
christ
because
know
if
i
had
not
ever
felt
his
presence
nor
been
guided
by
his
leading
such
words
might
possibly
trouble
me
but
having
seen
that
is
invisible
margaret
voice
was
steady
and
gentle
it
was
impossible
for
even
that
man
not
to
be
impressed
by
her
words
well
let
us
not
quarrel
about
it
he
said
indulgently
as
to
a
little
child
i
sure
you
have
a
very
charming
way
of
stating
it
and
i
not
sure
that
it
is
not
a
relief
to
find
a
woman
of
the
type
now
and
then
it
really
is
man
place
to
look
into
these
deeper
questions
anyway
it
is
woman
sphere
to
live
and
love
and
make
a
happy
home
his
voice
took
on
a
sentimental
purr
and
margaret
was
fairly
boiling
with
rage
at
him
but
she
would
not
let
her
temper
give
way
especially
when
she
was
talking
on
the
sacred
theme
of
the
christ
she
felt
as
if
she
must
scream
or
jump
out
over
the
wheel
and
run
away
from
this
obnoxious
man
but
she
knew
she
would
do
neither
she
knew
she
would
sit
calmly
through
the
expedition
and
somehow
control
that
conversation
there
was
one
relief
anyway
her
father
would
no
longer
expect
respect
and
honor
and
liking
toward
a
minister
who
denied
the
very
life
and
foundation
of
his
faith
it
ca
be
possible
that
the
is
so
far
from
the
town
she
said
suddenly
looking
around
at
the
widening
desert
in
front
of
them
have
you
made
some
mistake
why
i
thought
we
should
have
the
pleasure
of
a
little
drive
first
said
west
with
a
cunning
smile
i
was
sure
you
would
enjoy
seeing
the
country
before
you
get
down
to
work
and
i
was
not
averse
myself
to
a
drive
in
such
delightful
company
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
at
once
please
said
margaret
decidedly
and
there
was
that
in
her
voice
that
caused
the
man
to
turn
the
horse
around
and
head
it
toward
the
village
why
yes
of
course
if
you
prefer
to
see
the
first
we
can
go
back
and
look
it
over
and
then
perhaps
you
will
like
to
ride
a
little
farther
he
said
we
have
plenty
of
time
in
fact
tanner
told
me
she
would
not
expect
us
home
to
dinner
and
she
put
a
very
basket
of
lunch
under
the
seat
for
us
in
case
we
got
hungry
before
we
came
back
thank
you
said
margaret
quite
freezingly
now
i
really
do
not
care
to
drive
this
morning
i
would
like
to
see
the
and
then
i
must
return
to
the
house
at
once
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
this
morning
her
manner
at
last
penetrated
even
the
thick
skin
of
the
man
and
he
realized
that
he
had
gone
a
step
too
far
in
his
attentions
he
set
himself
to
undo
the
mischief
hoping
perhaps
to
melt
her
yet
to
take
the
drive
with
him
but
she
sat
silent
during
the
return
to
the
village
answering
his
volubility
only
by
yes
or
no
when
absolutely
necessary
she
let
him
babble
away
about
college
life
and
tell
incidents
of
his
late
pastorate
at
some
of
which
he
laughed
immoderately
but
he
could
not
even
bring
a
smile
to
her
dignified
lips
he
hoped
she
would
change
her
mind
when
they
got
to
the
school
building
and
he
even
stooped
to
praise
it
in
a
kind
of
contemptuous
way
as
they
drew
up
in
front
of
the
large
adobe
building
i
suppose
you
will
want
to
go
through
the
building
he
said
affably
producing
the
key
from
his
pocket
and
putting
on
a
pleasant
anticipatory
smile
but
margaret
shook
her
head
she
simply
would
not
go
into
the
building
with
that
man
it
is
not
necessary
she
said
again
coldly
i
think
i
will
go
home
now
please
and
he
was
forced
to
turn
the
horse
toward
the
tanner
house
crestfallen
and
wonder
why
this
beautiful
girl
was
so
extremely
hard
to
win
he
flattered
himself
that
he
had
always
been
able
to
interest
any
girl
he
chose
it
was
really
quite
a
bewildering
type
but
he
would
win
her
yet
he
set
her
down
silently
at
the
tanner
door
and
drove
off
and
all
into
the
wilderness
vexed
that
she
was
so
stubbornly
unfriendly
and
pondering
how
he
might
break
down
the
dignity
wherewith
she
had
surrounded
herself
there
would
be
a
way
and
he
would
find
it
there
was
a
stubbornness
about
that
weak
chin
of
his
when
one
observed
it
and
an
ugliness
in
his
eye
or
perhaps
you
would
call
it
a
hardness
chapter
ix
she
watched
him
furtively
from
her
bedroom
window
whither
she
had
fled
from
tanner
exclamations
he
wore
his
stylish
derby
tilted
down
over
his
left
eye
and
slightly
to
one
side
in
a
most
unministerial
manner
showing
too
much
of
his
back
hair
which
rose
in
a
cowlick
at
the
point
of
contact
with
the
hat
and
he
looked
a
small
mean
creature
as
he
drove
off
into
the
vast
beauty
of
the
plain
margaret
in
her
indignation
could
not
help
comparing
him
with
the
young
man
who
had
ridden
away
from
the
house
two
days
before
and
he
to
set
up
to
be
a
minister
of
christ
gospel
and
talk
like
that
about
the
bible
and
christ
oh
what
was
the
church
of
christ
coming
to
to
have
ministers
like
that
how
ever
did
he
get
into
the
ministry
anyway
of
course
she
knew
there
were
young
men
with
honest
doubts
who
sometimes
slid
through
nowadays
but
a
mean
little
silly
man
like
that
how
ever
did
he
get
in
what
a
lot
of
ridiculous
things
he
had
said
he
was
one
of
those
described
in
the
bible
who
darken
counsel
with
words
he
was
not
worth
noticing
and
yet
what
a
lot
of
harm
he
could
do
in
an
unlearned
community
just
see
how
tanner
hung
upon
his
words
as
though
they
were
law
and
gospel
how
she
margaret
found
herself
trembling
yet
over
the
words
he
had
spoken
about
christ
the
atonement
and
the
faith
they
meant
so
much
to
her
and
to
her
mother
and
father
they
were
not
mere
empty
words
of
tradition
that
she
believed
because
she
had
been
taught
she
had
lived
her
faith
and
proved
it
and
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
like
a
personal
insult
to
have
him
speak
so
of
her
saviour
she
turned
away
and
took
her
bible
to
try
and
get
a
bit
of
calmness
she
fluttered
the
leaves
for
something
she
could
not
just
tell
what
and
her
eye
caught
some
of
the
verses
that
her
father
had
marked
for
her
before
she
left
home
for
college
in
the
days
when
he
was
troubled
for
her
going
forth
into
the
world
of
unbelief
as
ye
have
therefore
received
christ
jesus
the
lord
so
walk
ye
in
him
rooted
and
built
up
in
him
and
established
in
the
faith
as
ye
have
been
taught
abounding
therein
with
thanksgiving
beware
lest
any
man
spoil
you
through
philosophy
and
vain
deceit
after
the
tradition
of
men
after
the
rudiments
of
the
world
and
not
after
christ
for
in
him
dwelleth
all
the
fullness
of
the
godhead
bodily
how
the
verses
crowded
upon
one
another
standing
out
clearly
from
the
pages
as
she
turned
them
marked
with
her
father
own
hand
in
clear
ink
underlinings
it
almost
seemed
as
if
god
had
looked
ahead
to
these
times
and
set
these
words
down
just
for
the
encouragement
of
his
troubled
servants
who
could
understand
why
faith
was
growing
dim
god
knew
about
it
had
known
it
would
be
all
this
doubt
and
had
put
words
here
just
for
troubled
hearts
to
be
comforted
thereby
for
i
know
whom
i
have
believed
how
her
heart
echoed
to
that
statement
and
am
persuaded
that
he
is
able
to
keep
that
which
i
have
committed
unto
him
against
that
day
and
on
a
little
further
nevertheless
the
foundation
of
god
standeth
sure
having
this
seal
the
lord
knoweth
them
that
are
his
there
was
a
triumphant
look
to
the
words
as
she
read
them
then
over
in
ephesians
her
eye
caught
a
verse
that
just
seemed
to
fit
that
poor
blind
minister
having
the
understanding
darkened
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
god
through
the
ignorance
that
is
in
them
because
of
the
blindness
of
their
heart
and
yet
he
was
set
to
guide
the
feet
of
the
blind
into
the
way
of
life
and
he
had
looked
on
her
as
one
of
the
ignorant
poor
fellow
he
could
know
the
christ
who
was
her
saviour
or
he
never
would
have
spoken
in
that
way
about
him
what
could
such
a
man
preach
what
was
there
left
to
preach
but
empty
words
when
one
rejected
all
these
doctrines
would
she
have
to
listen
to
a
man
like
that
sunday
after
sunday
did
the
scholars
in
her
school
and
their
parents
and
the
young
man
out
at
the
camp
and
his
rough
companions
have
to
listen
to
preaching
from
that
man
when
they
listened
to
any
her
heart
grew
sick
within
her
and
she
knelt
beside
her
bed
for
a
strengthening
word
with
the
christ
who
since
her
little
childhood
had
been
a
very
real
presence
in
her
life
when
she
arose
from
her
knees
she
heard
the
kitchen
door
slam
and
the
voice
of
bud
calling
his
mother
she
went
to
her
door
and
opened
it
listening
a
moment
and
then
called
the
boy
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
an
instant
after
her
voice
was
heard
and
then
bud
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
very
frowning
as
to
brow
and
very
surly
as
to
tone
what
d
want
it
was
plain
that
bud
was
sore
bud
margaret
voice
was
sweet
and
a
bit
cool
as
she
leaned
over
the
railing
and
surveyed
the
boy
she
had
yet
got
over
her
compulsory
ride
with
that
minister
i
wanted
to
ask
you
please
next
time
you
ca
keep
an
appointment
with
me
do
ask
anybody
else
to
take
your
place
i
prefer
to
pick
out
my
own
companions
it
was
all
right
of
course
if
you
had
to
go
somewhere
else
but
i
could
easily
have
gone
alone
or
waited
until
another
time
i
rather
not
have
you
ask
west
to
go
anywhere
with
me
again
bud
face
was
a
study
it
cleared
suddenly
and
his
jaw
dropped
in
surprise
his
eyes
fairly
danced
with
dawning
comprehension
and
pleasure
and
then
his
brow
drew
down
ominously
i
never
ast
him
he
declared
vehemently
he
told
me
you
wanted
him
to
go
and
fer
me
to
get
out
of
the
way
you
did
want
to
hurt
my
feelings
did
you
say
nothing
to
him
about
it
at
all
this
morning
no
indeed
said
margaret
with
flashing
eyes
well
i
just
thought
he
was
that
kind
of
a
guy
i
told
ma
he
was
lying
but
she
said
i
did
understand
young
ladies
and
of
course
you
did
want
me
when
there
was
a
man
and
especially
a
preacher
round
some
preacher
he
is
this
the
second
time
i
caught
him
lying
i
think
he
the
limit
i
just
wish
you
see
our
missionary
if
he
was
here
he
beat
the
dust
out
o
that
poor
stew
some
man
he
is
he
a
regular
white
man
just
you
wait
till
gets
back
margaret
drew
a
breath
of
relief
then
the
missionary
was
a
real
man
after
all
oh
for
his
return
well
i
certainly
very
glad
it
was
your
fault
bud
i
did
feel
very
happy
to
be
turned
off
that
way
said
the
teacher
smiling
down
upon
the
rough
head
of
the
boy
you
bet
it
was
my
fault
said
the
boy
vigorously
i
was
sore
a
pup
at
you
after
you
made
a
date
and
all
to
do
like
that
but
i
thought
if
you
wanted
to
go
with
that
guy
it
was
up
to
you
well
i
did
and
i
do
you
please
understand
hereafter
that
always
rather
have
your
company
than
his
how
about
going
down
to
the
some
time
have
you
time
did
you
go
yet
the
boy
face
looked
as
if
he
had
received
a
kingdom
and
his
voice
had
a
ring
of
triumph
we
drove
down
there
but
i
did
care
to
go
in
without
you
so
we
came
back
wanta
go
now
the
boy
face
fairly
shone
i
love
to
i
be
ready
in
three
minutes
could
we
carry
some
books
down
sure
oh
gee
that
guy
got
the
buckboard
we
have
to
walk
doggone
him
i
shall
enjoy
a
walk
i
want
to
find
out
just
how
far
it
is
for
i
shall
have
to
walk
every
day
you
know
no
you
wo
neither
you
wanta
i
always
hitch
up
that
be
very
nice
sometimes
but
i
afraid
i
get
spoiled
if
you
babied
me
all
the
time
that
way
i
be
right
down
they
went
out
together
into
the
sunshine
and
wideness
of
the
morning
and
it
seemed
a
new
day
had
been
created
since
she
got
back
from
her
ride
with
the
minister
she
looked
at
the
sturdy
boy
beside
her
and
was
glad
to
have
him
for
a
companion
just
in
front
of
the
margaret
paused
oh
i
forgot
the
key
west
has
the
key
in
his
pocket
we
ca
get
in
can
we
aw
we
do
need
a
key
said
her
escort
just
you
wait
and
he
whisked
around
to
the
back
of
the
building
and
in
about
three
minutes
his
shock
head
appeared
at
the
window
he
threw
the
sash
open
and
dropped
out
a
wooden
box
there
he
said
triumphantly
you
climb
up
on
that
cantcha
here
i
holdya
steady
take
holta
my
hand
and
so
it
was
through
the
front
window
that
the
new
teacher
of
the
ridge
school
first
appeared
on
her
future
scene
of
action
and
surveyed
her
little
kingdom
bud
threw
open
the
shutters
letting
the
view
of
the
plains
and
the
sunshine
into
the
big
dusty
room
and
showed
her
the
new
blackboard
with
great
pride
there
a
whole
box
o
chalk
up
on
the
desk
too
never
been
opened
yet
dad
said
that
was
your
property
want
i
should
open
it
why
yes
you
might
and
then
we
try
the
blackboard
wo
we
bud
went
to
work
gravely
opening
the
as
if
it
were
a
small
and
finally
produced
a
long
smooth
stick
of
chalk
and
handed
it
to
her
with
shining
eyes
you
try
it
first
bud
said
the
teacher
seeing
his
eagerness
and
the
boy
went
forward
awesomely
as
if
it
were
a
sacred
precinct
and
he
unworthy
to
intrude
shyly
awkwardly
with
infinite
painstaking
he
wrote
in
a
cramped
hand
william
budlong
tanner
and
then
growing
bolder
ashland
arizona
with
a
big
flourish
underneath
some
class
he
said
standing
back
and
regarding
his
handiwork
with
pride
say
i
like
the
sound
the
chalk
makes
on
it
do
you
yes
i
do
said
margaret
heartily
so
smooth
and
is
it
you
enjoy
doing
examples
in
algebra
on
it
wo
you
good
night
algebra
me
no
chance
i
ca
never
get
through
the
arithmetic
the
last
teacher
said
if
he
come
back
twenty
years
from
now
he
still
find
me
working
compound
interest
well
we
prove
to
that
man
that
he
was
much
of
a
judge
of
boys
said
margaret
with
a
tilt
of
her
chin
and
a
glint
of
her
showing
in
her
eyes
if
you
not
in
algebra
before
two
months
are
over
i
miss
my
guess
we
get
at
it
right
away
and
show
him
bud
watched
her
charmed
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
almost
anything
she
tried
would
come
true
now
bud
suppose
we
get
to
work
i
like
to
get
acquainted
with
my
class
a
little
before
monday
is
it
monday
school
opens
i
thought
so
well
suppose
you
give
me
the
names
of
the
scholars
and
i
write
them
down
and
that
will
help
me
to
remember
them
where
will
you
begin
here
suppose
you
sit
down
in
the
front
seat
and
tell
me
who
sits
there
and
a
little
bit
about
him
and
i
write
the
name
down
and
then
you
move
to
the
next
seat
and
tell
me
about
the
next
one
and
so
on
will
you
sure
said
bud
entering
into
the
new
game
but
it
ai
a
sits
there
it
susie
johnson
she
bill
johnson
smallest
girl
she
has
to
sit
front
she
giggles
so
much
she
has
yellow
curls
and
she
ducks
her
head
down
and
snickers
right
out
this
way
when
anything
funny
happens
in
school
and
bud
proceeded
to
duck
and
wriggle
in
perfect
imitation
of
the
small
susie
margaret
saw
the
boy
power
of
imitation
was
remarkable
and
laughed
heartily
at
his
burlesque
then
she
turned
and
wrote
susie
johnson
on
the
board
in
beautiful
script
bud
watched
with
admiration
saying
softly
under
his
breath
gee
that
great
that
blackboard
ai
it
amelia
schwartz
came
next
she
was
long
and
lank
with
the
buttons
off
the
back
of
her
dress
and
hands
and
feet
too
large
for
her
garments
margaret
could
not
help
but
see
her
in
the
clever
pantomime
the
boy
carried
on
next
was
rosa
rogers
daughter
of
a
wealthy
cattleman
the
beauty
of
the
school
with
all
the
boys
at
her
feet
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
her
power
over
them
bud
did
of
course
state
it
that
way
but
margaret
gathered
as
much
from
his
simpering
smile
and
the
coy
way
he
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
as
he
described
her
down
the
long
list
of
scholars
he
went
row
after
row
and
when
he
came
to
the
seats
where
the
boys
sat
his
tone
changed
she
could
tell
by
the
shading
of
his
voice
which
boys
were
the
ones
to
look
out
for
jed
brower
it
appeared
was
a
name
to
conjure
with
he
could
ride
any
horse
that
ever
stood
on
four
legs
he
could
outshoot
most
of
the
boys
in
the
neighborhood
and
he
never
allowed
any
teacher
to
tell
him
what
to
do
he
was
texas
brower
only
boy
and
always
had
his
own
way
his
father
was
on
the
school
board
jed
brower
was
held
in
awe
even
while
his
methods
were
despised
by
some
of
the
younger
boys
he
was
big
and
powerful
and
nobody
dared
fool
with
him
bud
did
not
exactly
warn
margaret
that
she
must
keep
on
the
right
side
of
jed
brower
but
he
conveyed
that
impression
without
words
margaret
understood
she
knew
also
that
tad
brooks
larry
parker
jim
long
and
dake
foster
were
merely
henchmen
of
the
worthy
jed
and
not
negligible
quantities
when
taken
by
themselves
but
over
the
name
of
timothy
forbes
delicate
forbes
bud
explained
was
his
nickname
the
boy
lingered
with
that
loving
inflection
of
admiration
that
a
younger
boy
will
sometimes
have
for
a
husky
courageous
older
lad
the
second
time
bud
spoke
of
him
he
called
him
forbeszy
and
margaret
perceived
that
here
was
bud
model
of
manhood
delicate
forbes
could
outshoot
and
outride
even
jed
brower
when
he
chose
and
his
courage
with
cattle
was
that
of
a
man
moreover
he
was
good
to
the
younger
boys
and
was
above
pitching
baseball
with
them
when
he
had
nothing
better
afoot
it
became
evident
from
the
general
description
that
delicate
forbes
was
not
called
so
from
any
lack
of
inches
to
his
stature
he
had
a
record
of
having
licked
every
man
teacher
in
the
school
and
beaten
by
guile
every
woman
teacher
they
had
had
in
six
years
bud
was
loyal
to
his
admiration
yet
it
could
be
plainly
seen
that
he
felt
margaret
greatest
hindrance
in
the
school
would
be
delicate
forbes
margaret
mentally
underlined
the
names
in
her
memory
that
belonged
to
the
back
seats
in
the
first
and
second
rows
of
desks
and
went
home
praying
that
she
might
have
wisdom
and
patience
to
deal
with
jed
brower
and
timothy
forbes
and
through
them
to
manage
the
rest
of
her
school
she
surprised
bud
at
the
by
handing
him
a
neat
diagram
of
the
desks
with
the
correct
names
of
all
but
three
or
four
of
the
scholars
written
on
them
such
a
feat
of
memory
raised
her
several
notches
in
his
estimation
say
that
going
some
guess
you
wo
forget
nothing
no
matter
how
much
they
try
to
make
you
chapter
x
the
minister
did
not
appear
until
late
in
the
evening
after
margaret
had
gone
to
her
room
for
which
she
was
sincerely
thankful
she
could
hear
his
voice
fretful
and
complaining
as
he
called
loudly
for
bud
to
take
the
horse
it
appeared
he
had
lost
his
way
and
wandered
many
miles
out
of
the
trail
he
blamed
the
country
for
having
no
better
trails
and
the
horse
for
not
being
able
to
find
his
way
better
tanner
had
gone
to
bed
but
tanner
bustled
about
and
tried
to
comfort
him
now
that
too
bad
dearie
me
bud
oughta
hev
gone
with
you
so
he
ought
bud
bud
you
gonta
sleep
yet
hev
you
wake
up
and
come
down
and
take
this
horse
to
the
barn
but
bud
declined
to
descend
he
shouted
some
sleepy
directions
from
his
loft
where
he
slept
and
said
the
minister
could
look
after
his
own
horse
he
gonta
there
was
plentya
corn
in
the
bin
the
minister
grumbled
his
way
to
the
barn
highly
incensed
at
bud
and
disturbed
the
calm
of
the
evening
view
of
margaret
mountain
by
his
complaints
when
he
returned
he
was
accustomed
to
handling
horses
and
he
thought
bud
might
have
stayed
up
and
attended
to
it
himself
bud
chuckled
in
his
loft
and
stole
down
the
back
kitchen
roof
while
the
minister
ate
his
late
supper
bud
would
never
leave
the
old
horse
to
that
amateur
tender
mercies
but
he
did
intend
to
make
it
easy
for
the
amateur
margaret
from
her
watching
the
night
in
the
darkness
saw
bud
slip
off
the
kitchen
roof
and
run
to
the
barn
and
she
smiled
to
herself
she
liked
that
boy
he
was
going
to
be
a
good
comrade
the
sabbath
morning
dawned
brilliantly
and
to
the
homesick
girl
there
suddenly
came
a
sense
of
desolation
on
waking
a
strange
land
was
this
without
or
sense
of
sabbath
fitness
the
mountain
it
is
true
greeted
her
with
a
holy
light
of
gladness
but
mountains
are
not
dependent
upon
humankind
for
being
in
the
spirit
on
the
lord
day
they
are
continually
praising
him
margaret
wondered
how
she
was
to
get
through
this
day
this
dreary
first
sabbath
away
from
her
home
and
her
class
and
her
dear
old
church
with
father
preaching
she
had
been
away
of
course
a
great
many
times
before
but
never
to
a
churchless
community
it
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
her
that
that
was
what
ashland
was
a
churchless
community
as
she
recalled
the
walk
to
the
school
and
the
ride
through
the
village
she
had
seen
nothing
that
looked
like
a
church
and
all
the
talk
had
been
of
the
missionary
they
must
have
services
of
some
sort
of
course
and
probably
that
flabby
man
her
was
to
preach
but
her
heart
turned
sick
at
thought
of
listening
to
a
man
who
had
confessed
to
the
unbeliefs
that
he
had
of
course
he
would
likely
know
enough
to
keep
such
doubts
to
himself
but
he
had
told
her
and
nothing
he
could
say
now
would
help
or
uplift
her
in
the
least
she
drew
a
deep
sigh
and
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
late
at
home
the
early
bells
would
be
ringing
and
little
girls
in
white
with
bunches
of
late
fall
flowers
for
their
teachers
and
holding
hands
with
their
little
brothers
would
be
hurrying
down
the
street
father
was
in
his
study
going
over
his
morning
sermon
and
mother
putting
her
little
pearl
pin
in
her
collar
getting
ready
to
go
to
her
bible
class
margaret
decided
it
was
time
to
get
up
and
stop
thinking
of
it
all
she
put
on
a
little
white
dress
that
she
wore
to
church
at
home
and
hurried
down
to
discover
what
the
family
plans
were
for
the
day
but
found
to
her
dismay
that
the
atmosphere
was
just
like
that
of
other
days
tanner
sat
tilted
back
in
a
chair
reading
the
weekly
paper
tanner
was
bustling
in
with
hot
bud
was
on
the
steps
teasing
the
dog
and
the
minister
came
in
with
an
air
of
weariness
upon
him
as
if
he
quite
intended
taking
it
out
on
his
companions
that
he
had
experienced
a
trying
time
on
saturday
he
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
a
man
who
expected
to
preach
in
a
few
minutes
he
declined
to
eat
his
egg
because
it
was
cooked
too
hard
and
poor
tanner
had
to
try
it
twice
before
she
succeeded
in
producing
a
egg
to
suit
him
only
the
radiant
outline
of
the
great
mountain
which
margaret
could
see
over
the
minister
head
looked
peaceful
and
what
time
do
you
have
service
margaret
asked
as
she
rose
from
the
table
service
it
was
tanner
who
echoed
her
question
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
she
meant
tanner
raised
her
eyes
from
her
belated
breakfast
with
a
worried
look
like
a
hen
stretching
her
neck
about
to
see
what
she
ought
to
do
next
for
the
comfort
of
the
chickens
under
her
care
it
was
apparent
that
she
had
no
comprehension
of
what
the
question
meant
it
was
the
minister
who
answered
condescendingly
um
ah
there
is
no
church
edifice
here
you
know
miss
earle
the
mission
station
is
located
some
miles
distant
i
know
said
margaret
but
they
surely
have
some
religious
service
i
really
do
know
said
the
minister
loftily
as
if
it
were
something
wholly
beneath
his
notice
then
you
are
not
going
to
preach
this
morning
in
spite
of
herself
there
was
relief
in
her
tone
most
certainly
not
he
replied
stiffly
i
came
out
here
to
rest
and
i
selected
this
place
largely
because
it
was
so
far
from
a
church
i
wanted
to
be
where
i
should
not
be
annoyed
by
requests
to
preach
of
course
ministers
from
the
east
would
be
a
curiosity
in
these
western
towns
and
i
should
really
get
no
rest
at
all
if
i
had
gone
where
my
services
would
have
been
in
constant
demand
when
i
came
out
here
i
was
in
much
the
condition
of
our
friend
the
minister
of
whom
you
have
doubtless
heard
he
was
starting
on
his
vacation
and
he
said
to
a
brother
minister
with
a
smile
of
joy
and
relief
preaching
no
praying
no
reading
of
the
bible
for
six
whole
weeks
indeed
said
margaret
freezingly
no
i
am
not
familiar
with
ministers
of
that
sort
she
turned
with
dismissal
in
her
manner
and
appealed
to
tanner
then
you
really
have
no
sabbath
service
of
any
sort
whatever
in
town
there
was
something
almost
tragic
in
her
face
she
stood
aghast
at
the
prospect
before
her
tanner
neck
stretched
up
a
little
longer
and
her
lips
dropped
apart
in
her
attempt
to
understand
the
situation
one
would
scarcely
have
been
surprised
to
hear
her
say
so
fluttered
did
she
seem
then
up
spoke
bud
we
got
ta
ma
there
was
pride
of
possession
in
bud
tone
and
a
kind
of
triumph
over
the
minister
albeit
bud
had
adjured
since
his
early
infancy
he
was
ready
now
however
to
be
offered
on
the
altar
of
even
if
that
would
please
the
new
teacher
and
spite
the
minister
i
take
you
ef
you
wanta
go
he
looked
defiantly
at
the
minister
as
he
said
it
but
at
last
tanner
seemed
to
grasp
what
was
the
matter
why
why
why
you
mean
preaching
service
she
clucked
out
why
yes
west
would
that
be
fine
you
could
preach
for
us
we
could
have
it
posted
up
at
the
saloon
and
the
crossings
and
out
a
ways
on
both
trails
and
you
have
quite
a
crowd
they
come
from
over
to
the
camp
and
up
the
cañon
way
and
roundabouts
they
do
you
credit
they
surely
would
west
and
you
could
have
the
for
a
pa
there
is
one
of
the
school
board
there
would
be
a
bit
of
trouble
um
ah
tanner
i
assure
you
it
quite
out
of
the
question
i
told
you
i
was
here
for
absolute
rest
i
could
think
of
preaching
besides
it
against
my
principles
to
preach
without
remuneration
a
wrong
idea
the
workman
is
worthy
of
his
hire
you
know
tanner
the
good
book
says
west
tone
took
on
a
inflection
oh
ef
that
all
that
be
all
right
she
said
with
relief
you
could
take
up
a
collection
the
boys
would
be
real
generous
they
always
are
when
any
show
comes
along
they
appreciate
it
you
know
and
like
fer
miss
earle
here
to
hear
you
preach
it
be
a
real
treat
to
her
her
being
a
preacher
daughter
and
all
she
turned
to
margaret
for
support
but
that
young
woman
was
talking
to
bud
she
had
promptly
closed
with
his
offer
to
take
her
to
and
now
she
hurried
away
to
get
ready
leaving
tanner
to
make
her
clerical
arrangements
without
aid
the
minister
meantime
looked
after
her
doubtfully
perhaps
after
all
it
would
have
been
a
good
move
to
have
preached
he
might
have
impressed
that
difficult
young
woman
better
that
way
than
any
other
seeing
she
posed
as
being
so
interested
in
religious
matters
he
turned
to
tanner
and
began
to
ask
questions
about
the
feasibility
of
a
church
service
the
word
collection
sounded
good
to
him
he
was
not
averse
to
replenishing
his
somewhat
depleted
treasury
if
it
could
be
done
so
easily
as
that
meantime
margaret
up
in
her
room
was
wondering
again
how
such
a
man
as
west
ever
got
into
the
christian
ministry
west
was
still
endeavoring
to
impress
the
tanners
with
the
importance
of
his
late
charge
in
the
east
as
margaret
came
his
pompous
tones
raised
to
favor
the
deafness
that
he
took
for
granted
in
tanner
easily
reached
her
ears
i
could
of
course
think
of
doing
it
every
sunday
you
understand
it
would
be
fair
to
myself
nor
my
work
which
i
have
just
left
but
of
course
if
there
were
sufficient
inducement
i
might
consent
to
preach
some
sunday
before
i
leave
tanner
little
satisfied
cluck
was
quite
audible
as
the
girl
closed
the
front
door
and
went
out
to
the
waiting
bud
the
was
a
desolate
affair
presided
over
by
an
elderly
and
very
illiterate
man
who
nursed
his
elbows
and
rubbed
his
chin
meditatively
between
the
slow
questions
which
he
read
out
of
the
the
woman
who
usually
taught
the
children
was
called
away
to
nurse
a
sick
neighbor
and
the
children
were
huddled
together
in
a
restless
group
the
singing
was
poor
and
the
whole
of
the
exercises
dreary
including
the
prayer
the
few
women
present
sat
and
stared
in
a
kind
of
awe
at
the
visitor
half
belligerently
as
if
she
were
an
intruder
bud
lingered
outside
the
door
and
finally
disappeared
altogether
reappearing
when
the
last
hymn
was
sung
altogether
the
new
teacher
felt
exceedingly
homesick
as
she
wended
her
way
back
to
the
tanners
beside
bud
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
on
sunday
afternoons
bud
she
asked
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
rest
of
the
group
the
boy
turned
wondering
eyes
toward
her
do
he
repeated
puzzled
why
we
pass
the
time
away
like
any
day
there
ai
much
difference
a
great
desolation
possessed
her
no
church
worse
than
no
minister
no
sabbath
what
kind
of
a
land
was
this
to
which
she
had
come
the
boy
beside
her
smelled
of
tobacco
smoke
he
had
been
off
somewhere
smoking
while
she
was
in
the
dreary
little
she
looked
at
his
careless
furtively
as
they
walked
along
he
smoked
of
course
like
most
boys
of
his
age
probably
and
he
did
a
lot
of
other
things
he
ought
not
to
do
he
had
no
interest
in
god
or
righteousness
and
he
did
not
take
it
for
granted
that
the
sabbath
was
different
from
any
other
day
a
sudden
came
upon
her
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
do
anything
for
such
as
he
why
not
give
it
up
now
and
go
back
where
there
was
more
promising
material
to
work
upon
and
where
she
would
be
welcome
indeed
of
course
she
had
known
things
would
be
discouraging
but
somehow
it
had
seemed
different
from
a
distance
it
all
looked
utterly
hopeless
now
and
herself
crazy
to
have
thought
she
could
do
any
good
in
a
place
like
this
and
yet
the
place
needed
somebody
that
pitiful
little
how
forlorn
it
all
was
she
was
almost
sorry
she
had
gone
it
gave
her
an
unhappy
feeling
for
the
morrow
which
was
to
be
her
first
day
of
school
then
all
suddenly
just
as
they
were
nearing
the
tanner
house
there
came
one
riding
down
the
street
with
all
the
glory
of
the
radiant
morning
in
his
face
and
a
light
in
his
eyes
at
seeing
her
that
lifted
away
her
desolation
for
here
at
last
was
a
friend
she
wondered
at
herself
an
unknown
stranger
and
a
failure
so
far
in
his
young
life
and
yet
he
seemed
so
good
a
sight
to
her
amid
these
uncongenial
surroundings
chapter
xi
this
stranger
of
royal
bearing
riding
a
rough
western
pony
as
if
it
were
decked
with
golden
trappings
with
his
bright
hair
gleaming
like
roman
gold
in
the
sun
and
his
eyes
looking
into
hers
with
the
gladness
of
his
youth
this
one
who
had
come
to
her
out
of
the
of
the
wilderness
and
led
her
into
safety
yes
she
was
glad
to
see
him
he
dismounted
and
greeted
her
his
wide
hat
in
his
hand
his
eyes
upon
her
face
and
bud
stepped
back
watching
them
in
pleased
surprise
this
was
the
man
who
had
shot
all
the
lights
out
the
night
of
the
big
riot
in
the
saloon
he
had
also
risked
his
life
in
a
number
of
foolish
ways
at
recent
festal
carouses
bud
would
not
have
been
a
boy
had
he
not
admired
the
young
man
beyond
measure
and
his
boy
worship
of
the
teacher
yielded
her
to
a
fitting
rival
he
stepped
behind
and
walked
beside
the
pony
who
was
following
his
master
meekly
as
though
he
too
were
under
the
young
man
charm
oh
and
this
is
my
friend
william
tanner
spoke
margaret
turning
toward
the
boy
loyally
whatever
good
angel
made
her
call
him
william
bud
soul
swelled
with
new
dignity
as
he
blushed
and
acknowledged
the
introduction
by
a
grin
glad
to
know
you
will
said
the
extending
his
hand
in
a
hearty
shake
that
warmed
the
boy
heart
in
a
trice
i
glad
miss
earle
has
so
good
a
protector
you
have
to
look
out
for
her
pretty
plucky
and
is
apt
to
stray
around
the
wilderness
by
herself
it
is
safe
you
know
boy
for
such
as
her
look
after
her
will
you
right
i
will
said
bud
accepting
the
commission
as
if
it
were
and
thereafter
walked
behind
the
two
with
his
head
in
the
clouds
he
felt
that
he
understood
this
great
hero
of
the
plains
and
was
one
with
him
at
heart
there
could
be
no
higher
honor
than
to
be
the
servitor
of
this
man
lady
bud
did
not
stop
to
question
how
the
new
teacher
became
acquainted
with
the
young
rider
of
the
plains
it
was
enough
that
both
were
young
and
handsome
and
seemed
to
belong
together
he
felt
they
were
fitting
friends
the
little
procession
walked
down
the
road
slowly
glad
to
prolong
the
way
the
young
man
had
brought
her
handkerchief
a
filmy
trifle
of
an
excuse
that
she
had
dropped
behind
her
chair
at
the
where
it
had
lain
unnoticed
till
she
was
gone
he
produced
it
from
his
inner
pocket
as
though
it
had
been
too
precious
to
carry
anywhere
but
over
his
heart
yet
there
was
in
his
manner
nothing
presuming
not
a
hint
of
any
intimacy
other
than
their
chance
acquaintance
of
the
wilderness
would
warrant
he
did
not
look
at
her
with
any
such
look
as
west
had
given
every
time
he
spoke
to
her
she
felt
no
desire
to
resent
his
glance
when
it
rested
upon
her
almost
worshipfully
for
there
was
respect
and
utmost
humility
in
his
look
the
men
had
sent
gifts
some
and
a
curiously
fashioned
vessel
from
the
cañon
of
the
some
chips
from
the
petrified
forest
a
fern
with
wonderful
fronds
root
and
all
and
a
sheaf
of
strange
beautiful
blossoms
carefully
wrapped
in
wet
paper
and
all
fastened
to
the
saddle
margaret
face
kindled
with
interest
as
he
showed
them
to
her
one
by
one
and
told
her
the
history
of
each
and
a
little
message
from
the
man
who
had
sent
it
mom
wallis
too
had
baked
a
queer
little
cake
and
sent
it
the
young
man
face
was
tender
as
he
spoke
of
it
the
girl
saw
that
he
knew
what
her
coming
had
meant
to
mom
wallis
her
memory
went
quickly
back
to
those
few
words
the
morning
she
had
wakened
in
the
and
found
the
withered
old
woman
watching
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
poor
mom
wallis
with
her
pretty
girlhood
all
behind
her
and
such
a
blank
dull
future
ahead
poor
tired
mom
wallis
margaret
heart
went
out
to
her
they
want
to
know
said
the
young
man
half
hesitatingly
if
some
time
when
you
get
settled
and
have
time
you
would
come
to
them
again
and
sing
i
tried
to
make
them
understand
of
course
that
you
would
be
busy
your
time
taken
with
other
friends
and
your
work
and
you
would
not
want
to
come
but
they
wanted
me
to
tell
you
they
never
enjoyed
anything
so
much
in
years
as
your
singing
why
i
heard
long
jim
singing
folks
at
home
this
morning
when
he
was
saddling
his
horse
and
it
made
a
difference
the
men
sort
of
want
to
straighten
up
the
jasper
made
a
new
chair
yesterday
he
said
it
would
do
when
you
came
again
gardley
laughed
diffidently
as
if
he
knew
their
hopes
were
all
in
vain
but
margaret
looked
up
with
sympathy
in
her
face
i
come
of
course
i
come
some
time
she
said
eagerly
i
come
as
soon
as
i
can
arrange
it
you
tell
them
we
have
more
than
one
concert
yet
the
young
man
face
lit
up
with
a
quick
appreciation
and
the
flash
of
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
would
have
told
any
onlooker
that
he
felt
here
was
a
girl
in
a
thousand
a
girl
with
an
angel
spirit
if
ever
such
a
one
walked
the
earth
now
it
happened
that
rev
frederick
west
was
walking
impatiently
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
tanner
residence
looking
down
the
road
about
that
time
he
had
spent
the
morning
in
looking
over
the
small
bundle
of
show
sermons
he
had
brought
with
him
in
case
of
emergency
and
had
about
decided
to
accede
to
tanner
request
and
preach
in
ashland
before
he
left
this
decision
had
put
him
in
so
a
mood
that
he
was
eager
to
announce
it
before
his
moreover
he
was
hungry
and
he
could
not
understand
why
that
impudent
boy
and
that
coquettish
young
woman
should
remain
away
at
such
an
interminable
time
tanner
was
frying
chicken
he
could
smell
it
every
time
he
took
a
turn
toward
the
house
it
really
was
ridiculous
that
they
should
keep
dinner
waiting
this
way
he
took
one
more
turn
and
began
to
think
over
the
sermon
he
had
decided
to
preach
he
was
just
recalling
a
particularly
eloquent
passage
when
he
happened
to
look
down
the
road
once
more
and
there
they
were
almost
upon
him
but
bud
was
no
longer
walking
with
the
maiden
she
had
acquired
a
new
escort
a
man
of
broad
shoulders
and
fine
height
where
had
he
seen
that
fellow
before
he
watched
them
as
they
came
up
his
small
pale
eyes
narrowing
under
their
yellow
lashes
with
a
glint
of
slyness
like
some
mean
little
animal
that
meant
to
take
advantage
of
its
prey
it
was
wonderful
how
many
different
things
that
man
could
look
like
for
a
person
as
insignificant
as
he
really
was
well
he
saw
the
look
between
the
man
and
maiden
the
look
of
sympathy
and
admiration
and
a
fine
kind
of
trust
that
is
not
founded
on
mere
outward
show
but
has
found
some
hidden
fineness
of
the
soul
not
that
the
reverend
gentleman
understood
that
however
he
had
no
fineness
of
soul
himself
his
mind
had
been
too
thoroughly
taken
up
with
himself
all
his
life
for
him
to
have
cultivated
any
simultaneous
with
the
look
came
his
recognition
of
the
man
or
at
least
of
where
he
had
last
seen
him
and
his
little
soul
rejoiced
at
the
advantage
he
instantly
recognized
he
drew
himself
up
importantly
flattened
his
chin
upward
until
his
lower
lip
protruded
in
a
pink
roll
across
his
mouth
drew
down
his
yellow
brows
in
a
frown
of
displeasure
and
came
forward
to
meet
the
little
party
as
it
neared
the
house
he
had
the
air
of
coming
to
investigate
and
possibly
oust
the
stranger
and
he
looked
at
him
keenly
critically
offensively
as
if
he
had
the
right
to
protect
the
lady
they
might
have
been
a
pair
of
naughty
children
come
back
from
a
forbidden
frolic
from
the
way
he
surveyed
them
but
the
beauty
of
it
was
that
neither
of
them
saw
him
being
occupied
with
each
other
until
they
were
fairly
upon
him
then
there
he
stood
offensively
as
if
he
were
a
great
power
to
be
reckoned
with
well
well
well
miss
margaret
you
have
got
home
at
last
he
said
pompously
and
condescendingly
and
then
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
her
companion
as
if
demanding
an
explanation
of
presence
there
margaret
drew
herself
up
haughtily
his
use
of
her
christian
name
in
that
familiar
tone
annoyed
her
exceedingly
her
eyes
flashed
indignantly
but
the
whole
of
it
was
lost
unless
bud
saw
it
for
gardley
had
faced
his
adversary
with
a
keen
surprised
scrutiny
and
was
looking
him
over
coolly
there
was
that
in
the
young
man
eye
that
made
the
eye
of
frederick
west
quail
before
him
it
was
only
an
instant
the
two
stood
challenging
each
other
but
in
that
short
time
each
knew
and
marked
the
other
for
an
enemy
only
a
brief
instant
and
then
gardley
turned
to
margaret
and
before
she
had
time
to
think
what
to
say
he
asked
is
this
man
a
friend
of
yours
miss
with
marked
emphasis
on
the
last
word
no
said
margaret
coolly
not
a
friend
a
boarder
in
the
house
then
most
formally
west
my
mr
gardley
if
the
minister
had
not
been
possessed
of
the
skin
of
a
rhinoceros
he
would
have
understood
himself
to
be
dismissed
at
that
but
he
was
not
a
man
accustomed
to
accepting
dismissal
as
his
recent
church
in
new
york
state
might
have
testified
he
stood
his
ground
his
chin
flatter
than
ever
his
little
eyes
mere
slits
of
condemnation
he
did
not
acknowledge
the
introduction
by
so
much
as
the
inclination
of
his
head
his
hands
were
clasped
behind
his
back
and
his
whole
attitude
was
one
of
righteous
belligerence
gardley
gazed
steadily
at
him
for
a
moment
a
look
of
mingled
contempt
and
amusement
gradually
growing
upon
his
face
then
he
turned
away
as
if
the
man
were
too
small
to
notice
you
will
come
in
and
take
dinner
with
me
asked
margaret
eagerly
i
want
to
send
a
small
package
to
wallis
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
take
it
with
you
i
sorry
i
ca
stay
to
dinner
but
i
have
an
errand
in
another
direction
and
at
some
distance
i
am
returning
this
way
however
and
if
i
may
will
call
and
get
the
package
toward
evening
margaret
eyes
spoke
her
welcome
and
with
a
few
formal
words
the
young
man
sprang
on
his
horse
said
so
long
will
to
bud
and
ignoring
the
minister
rode
away
they
watched
him
for
an
instant
for
indeed
he
was
a
goodly
sight
upon
a
horse
riding
as
if
he
and
the
horse
were
utterly
one
in
spirit
then
margaret
turned
quickly
to
go
into
the
house
um
ah
miss
margaret
began
the
minister
with
a
commandatory
gesture
for
her
to
stop
margaret
was
the
picture
of
haughtiness
as
she
turned
and
said
miss
if
you
please
um
ah
why
certainly
miss
ah
if
you
wish
it
will
you
kindly
remain
here
for
a
moment
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
bud
you
may
go
on
i
go
when
i
like
and
it
none
of
your
business
muttered
bud
ominously
under
his
breath
he
looked
at
margaret
to
see
if
she
wished
him
to
go
he
had
an
idea
that
this
might
be
one
of
the
times
when
he
was
to
look
after
her
she
smiled
at
him
understandingly
william
may
remain
west
she
said
sweetly
anything
you
have
to
say
to
me
can
surely
be
said
in
his
presence
and
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
bud
sleeve
bud
looked
down
at
the
hand
proudly
and
grew
inches
taller
enjoying
the
minister
frown
um
ah
said
west
unabashed
well
i
merely
wished
to
warn
you
concerning
the
character
of
that
person
who
has
just
left
us
he
is
really
not
a
proper
companion
for
you
indeed
i
may
say
he
is
quite
the
contrary
and
that
to
my
personal
knowledge
he
as
good
as
you
are
and
better
growled
bud
ominously
be
quiet
boy
i
was
speaking
to
you
said
west
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
slave
if
i
hear
another
word
from
your
lips
i
shall
report
it
to
your
father
go
far
you
like
and
see
how
much
i
care
taunted
bud
but
was
stopped
by
margaret
gentle
pressure
on
his
arm
west
i
thought
i
made
you
understand
that
gardley
is
my
friend
um
ah
miss
earle
then
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
you
have
formed
a
most
unwise
friendship
and
should
let
it
proceed
no
further
why
my
dear
young
lady
if
you
knew
all
there
is
to
know
about
him
you
would
not
think
of
speaking
to
that
young
man
indeed
west
i
suppose
that
might
be
true
of
a
good
many
people
might
it
not
we
knew
all
there
is
to
know
about
nobody
but
god
could
very
well
get
along
with
some
of
us
but
my
dear
young
lady
you
do
understand
this
young
person
is
nothing
but
a
common
ruffian
a
gambler
in
fact
and
an
habitué
at
the
saloons
i
have
seen
him
myself
sitting
in
a
saloon
at
a
very
late
hour
playing
with
a
vile
dirty
pack
of
cards
and
in
the
company
of
a
lot
of
creatures
may
i
ask
how
you
came
to
be
in
a
saloon
at
that
hour
mr
west
there
was
a
gleam
of
mischief
in
the
girl
eyes
and
her
mouth
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
laugh
but
she
controlled
it
the
minister
turned
very
red
indeed
well
i
ah
i
had
been
called
from
my
bed
by
shouts
and
the
report
of
a
pistol
there
was
a
fight
going
on
in
the
room
adjoining
the
bar
and
i
did
know
but
my
assistance
might
be
needed
at
this
juncture
bud
uttered
a
sort
of
snort
and
placing
his
hands
over
his
heart
ducked
down
as
if
a
sudden
pain
had
seized
him
but
imagine
my
pain
and
astonishment
when
i
was
informed
that
the
drunken
brawl
i
was
witnessing
was
but
a
nightly
and
common
occurrence
i
may
say
i
remained
for
a
few
minutes
partly
out
of
curiosity
as
i
wished
to
see
all
kinds
of
life
in
this
new
world
for
the
sake
of
a
book
i
am
thinking
of
writing
i
therefore
took
careful
note
of
the
persons
present
and
was
thus
able
to
identify
the
person
who
has
just
ridden
away
as
one
of
the
chief
factors
in
that
entertainment
he
was
in
fact
the
man
who
when
he
had
pocketed
all
the
money
on
the
arose
and
taking
out
his
pistol
shot
out
the
lights
in
the
room
a
most
dangerous
and
irregular
proceeding
yes
and
you
came
within
an
ace
of
being
shot
pa
says
the
kid
a
dead
shot
he
is
and
you
were
right
in
the
way
served
you
right
for
going
where
you
had
no
business
i
did
not
remain
longer
in
that
place
as
you
may
imagine
went
on
west
ignoring
bud
for
i
found
it
was
no
place
for
a
for
a
ah
minister
of
the
gospel
but
i
remained
long
enough
to
hear
from
the
lips
of
this
person
with
whom
you
have
just
been
walking
some
of
the
most
terrible
language
my
ears
have
ever
been
permitted
to
ah
witness
but
margaret
had
heard
all
that
she
intended
to
listen
to
on
that
subject
with
decided
tone
she
interrupted
the
voluble
speaker
who
was
evidently
enjoying
his
own
eloquence
west
i
think
you
have
said
all
that
it
is
necessary
to
say
there
are
still
some
things
about
gardley
that
you
evidently
do
not
know
but
i
think
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
learn
them
if
you
stay
in
this
part
of
the
country
long
william
is
that
your
mother
calling
us
to
dinner
let
us
go
in
i
hungry
bud
followed
her
up
the
walk
with
a
triumphant
wink
at
the
discomfited
minister
and
they
disappeared
into
the
house
but
when
margaret
went
up
to
her
room
and
took
off
her
hat
in
front
of
the
little
warped
there
were
angry
tears
in
her
eyes
she
never
felt
more
like
crying
in
her
life
chagrin
and
anger
and
disappointment
were
all
struggling
in
her
soul
yet
she
must
not
cry
for
dinner
would
be
ready
and
she
must
go
down
never
should
that
mean
little
meddling
man
see
that
his
words
had
pierced
her
soul
for
angry
as
she
was
at
the
minister
much
as
she
loathed
his
petty
jealous
nature
and
saw
through
his
something
yet
told
her
that
his
picture
of
young
gardley
wildness
was
probably
true
and
her
soul
sank
within
her
at
the
thought
it
was
just
what
had
come
in
shadowy
instinctive
fear
to
her
heart
when
he
had
hinted
at
his
being
a
roughneck
yet
to
have
it
put
baldly
into
words
by
an
enemy
hurt
her
deeply
and
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
half
frightened
margaret
earle
have
you
come
out
to
the
wilderness
to
lose
your
heart
to
the
first
handsome
sower
of
wild
oats
that
you
meet
her
true
eyes
asked
her
face
in
the
glass
and
margaret
earle
heart
turned
sad
at
the
question
and
shrank
back
then
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
beside
her
gay
little
and
buried
her
face
in
its
flowered
cushions
and
cried
to
her
father
in
heaven
oh
my
father
let
me
not
be
weak
but
with
all
my
heart
i
cry
to
thee
to
save
this
young
strong
courageous
life
and
not
let
it
be
a
failure
help
him
to
find
thee
and
serve
thee
and
if
his
life
has
been
all
wrong
and
i
suppose
it
has
oh
make
it
right
for
jesus
sake
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
do
to
help
show
me
how
and
do
let
me
make
mistakes
oh
jesus
thy
power
is
great
let
this
young
man
feel
it
and
yield
himself
to
it
she
remained
silently
praying
for
a
moment
more
putting
her
whole
soul
into
the
prayer
and
knowing
that
she
had
been
called
thus
to
pray
for
him
until
her
prayer
was
answered
she
came
down
to
dinner
a
few
minutes
later
with
a
calm
serene
face
on
which
was
no
hint
of
her
recent
emotion
and
she
managed
to
keep
the
table
conversation
wholly
in
her
own
hands
telling
tanner
about
her
home
town
and
her
father
and
mother
when
the
meal
was
finished
the
minister
had
no
excuse
to
think
that
the
new
teacher
was
careless
about
her
friends
and
associates
and
he
was
well
informed
about
the
high
principles
of
her
family
but
west
had
retired
into
a
sulky
mood
and
uttered
not
a
word
except
to
ask
for
more
chicken
and
coffee
and
a
second
helping
of
pie
it
was
perhaps
during
that
dinner
that
he
decided
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
preach
in
ashland
on
the
following
sunday
the
young
lady
could
be
properly
impressed
with
his
dignity
in
no
other
way
chapter
xii
when
lance
gardley
came
back
to
the
tanners
the
sun
was
preparing
the
glory
of
its
evening
setting
and
the
mountain
was
robed
in
all
its
rosiest
veils
margaret
was
waiting
for
him
with
the
dog
captain
beside
her
wandering
back
and
forth
in
the
unfenced
dooryard
and
watching
her
mountain
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
find
that
the
minister
occupied
a
room
on
the
first
floor
in
a
kind
of
ell
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
from
her
own
room
and
her
mountain
he
had
not
been
visible
that
afternoon
and
with
captain
by
her
side
and
bud
on
the
step
reading
sky
she
felt
comparatively
safe
she
had
read
to
bud
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
he
was
thoroughly
interested
in
the
story
but
she
was
sure
he
would
keep
the
minister
away
at
all
costs
as
for
captain
he
and
the
minister
were
sworn
enemies
by
this
time
he
growled
every
time
west
came
near
or
spoke
to
her
she
made
a
picture
standing
with
her
hand
on
captain
shaggy
noble
head
the
lace
of
her
sleeve
falling
back
from
the
white
arm
her
other
hand
raised
to
shade
her
face
as
she
looked
away
to
the
glorified
mountain
a
slim
white
figure
looking
wistfully
off
at
the
sunset
the
young
man
took
off
his
hat
and
rode
his
horse
more
softly
as
if
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
the
dog
lifted
one
ear
and
a
tremor
passed
through
his
frame
as
the
rider
drew
near
otherwise
he
did
not
stir
from
his
position
but
it
was
enough
the
girl
turned
on
the
alert
at
once
and
met
him
with
a
smile
and
the
young
man
looked
at
her
as
if
an
angel
had
deigned
to
smile
upon
him
there
was
a
humility
in
his
fine
face
that
sat
well
with
the
courage
written
there
and
smoothed
away
all
hardness
for
the
time
so
that
the
girl
looking
at
him
in
the
light
of
the
revelations
of
the
morning
could
hardly
believe
it
had
been
true
yet
an
inner
fineness
of
perception
taught
her
that
it
was
the
young
man
dismounted
and
left
his
horse
standing
quietly
by
the
roadside
he
would
not
stay
he
said
yet
lingered
by
her
side
talking
for
a
few
minutes
watching
the
sunset
and
pointing
out
its
changes
she
gave
him
the
little
package
for
mom
wallis
there
was
a
simple
lace
collar
in
a
little
white
box
and
a
tiny
book
done
in
russet
suède
with
gold
lettering
tell
her
to
wear
the
collar
and
think
of
me
whenever
she
dresses
up
i
afraid
that
never
be
then
said
the
young
man
with
a
pitying
smile
mom
wallis
never
dresses
up
tell
her
i
said
she
must
dress
up
evenings
for
supper
and
i
make
her
another
one
to
change
with
that
and
bring
it
when
i
come
he
smiled
upon
her
again
that
wondering
almost
worshipful
smile
as
if
he
wondered
if
she
were
real
after
all
so
different
did
she
seem
from
his
idea
of
girls
and
the
little
book
she
went
on
apologetically
i
suppose
it
was
foolish
to
send
it
but
something
she
said
made
me
think
of
some
of
the
lines
in
the
poem
i
marked
them
for
her
she
reads
does
she
a
little
i
think
i
see
her
now
and
then
read
the
papers
that
pop
brings
home
with
him
i
do
fancy
her
literary
range
is
very
wide
however
of
course
i
suppose
it
is
ridiculous
and
maybe
she
not
understand
any
of
it
but
tell
her
i
sent
her
a
message
she
must
see
if
she
can
find
it
in
the
poem
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
to
her
it
ben
ezra
you
know
it
do
you
i
afraid
not
i
was
intent
on
other
things
about
the
time
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
giving
my
attention
to
browning
or
i
would
be
what
i
am
i
suppose
but
i
do
my
best
with
what
wits
i
have
it
about
could
you
give
me
a
pointer
or
two
it
the
one
beginning
grow
old
along
with
me
the
best
is
yet
to
be
the
last
of
life
for
which
the
first
was
made
our
times
are
in
his
hand
who
saith
whole
i
planned
youth
shows
but
half
trust
god
see
all
nor
be
afraid
he
looked
down
at
her
still
with
that
wondering
smile
grow
old
along
with
you
he
said
gravely
and
then
sighed
you
do
look
as
if
you
ever
would
grow
old
that
it
she
said
eagerly
that
the
whole
idea
we
do
ever
grow
old
and
get
done
with
it
all
we
just
go
on
to
bigger
things
wiser
and
better
and
more
beautiful
till
we
come
to
understand
and
be
a
part
of
the
whole
great
plan
of
god
he
did
not
attempt
an
answer
nor
did
he
smile
now
but
just
looked
at
her
with
that
deeply
quizzical
grave
look
as
if
his
soul
were
turning
over
the
matter
seriously
she
held
her
peace
and
waited
unable
to
find
the
right
word
to
speak
then
he
turned
and
looked
off
an
infinite
regret
growing
in
his
face
that
makes
living
a
different
thing
from
the
way
most
people
take
it
he
said
at
last
and
his
tone
showed
that
he
was
considering
it
deeply
does
it
she
said
softly
and
looked
with
him
toward
the
sunset
still
half
seeing
his
quiet
profile
against
the
light
at
last
it
came
to
her
that
she
must
speak
half
fearfully
she
began
i
been
thinking
about
what
you
said
on
the
ride
you
said
you
did
make
good
i
wish
you
would
i
i
sure
you
could
she
looked
up
wistfully
and
saw
the
gentleness
come
into
his
face
as
if
the
fountain
of
his
soul
long
sealed
had
broken
up
and
as
if
he
saw
a
possibility
before
him
for
the
first
time
through
the
words
she
had
spoken
at
last
he
turned
to
her
with
that
wondering
smile
again
why
should
you
care
he
asked
the
words
would
have
sounded
harsh
if
his
tone
had
not
been
so
gentle
margaret
hesitated
for
an
answer
i
do
know
how
to
tell
it
she
said
slowly
there
another
verse
a
few
lines
more
in
that
poem
perhaps
you
know
them
i
never
could
be
all
men
ignored
in
me
this
i
was
worth
to
god
whose
wheel
the
pitcher
shaped
i
want
it
because
well
perhaps
because
i
feel
you
are
worth
all
that
to
god
i
would
like
to
see
you
be
that
he
looked
down
at
her
again
and
was
still
so
long
that
she
felt
she
had
failed
miserably
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
speaking
she
added
i
it
seems
there
are
so
many
grand
possibilities
in
life
and
for
you
i
could
bear
to
have
you
say
you
had
made
good
as
if
it
were
all
over
i
glad
you
spoke
he
said
quickly
i
guess
perhaps
i
have
been
all
kinds
of
a
fool
you
have
made
me
feel
how
many
kinds
i
have
been
oh
no
she
protested
you
do
know
what
i
have
been
he
said
sadly
and
then
with
sudden
conviction
as
if
he
read
her
thoughts
you
know
that
prig
of
a
parson
has
told
you
well
it
just
as
well
you
should
know
right
a
wave
of
misery
passed
over
his
face
and
erased
all
its
brightness
and
hope
even
the
gentleness
was
gone
he
looked
haggard
and
drawn
with
hopelessness
all
in
a
moment
do
you
think
it
would
matter
to
me
that
man
would
say
she
protested
all
her
woman
heart
going
out
in
pity
but
it
was
true
all
he
said
probably
and
more
it
does
matter
she
said
eagerly
the
other
is
true
too
just
as
the
poem
says
that
man
ignores
in
you
just
that
you
are
worth
to
god
and
you
be
what
he
meant
you
to
be
i
have
been
praying
all
the
afternoon
that
he
would
help
you
to
be
have
you
he
said
and
his
eyes
lit
up
again
as
if
the
of
hope
were
burning
once
more
have
you
i
thank
you
you
came
to
me
when
i
was
lost
in
the
wilderness
she
said
shyly
i
wanted
to
help
back
if
i
might
you
will
help
you
have
he
said
earnestly
and
i
was
far
enough
off
the
trail
too
but
if
there
any
way
to
get
back
i
get
there
he
grasped
her
hand
and
held
it
for
a
second
keep
up
that
praying
he
said
i
see
what
can
be
done
margaret
looked
up
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
he
looked
reverently
into
her
eyes
all
the
manhood
in
him
stirred
to
higher
better
things
then
suddenly
as
they
stood
together
a
sound
smote
their
ears
as
from
another
world
um
ah
the
minister
stood
within
the
doorway
barred
by
bud
in
scowling
defiance
and
guarded
by
cap
who
gave
an
answering
growl
gardley
and
margaret
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
then
turned
and
walked
slowly
down
to
where
the
pony
stood
they
did
not
wish
to
talk
here
in
that
alien
presence
indeed
it
seemed
that
more
words
were
not
needed
they
would
be
a
desecration
so
he
rode
away
into
the
sunset
once
more
with
just
another
look
and
a
and
she
turned
strangely
happy
at
heart
to
go
back
to
her
dull
surroundings
and
her
uncongenial
company
come
william
let
have
a
praise
service
she
said
brightly
pausing
at
the
doorway
but
ignoring
the
scowling
minister
a
praise
service
what
a
praise
service
asked
the
wondering
bud
shoving
over
to
let
her
sit
down
beside
him
she
sat
with
her
back
to
west
and
cap
came
and
lay
at
her
feet
with
the
white
of
one
eye
on
the
minister
and
a
growl
ready
to
gleam
between
his
teeth
any
minute
there
was
just
no
way
for
the
minister
to
get
out
unless
he
jumped
over
them
or
went
out
the
back
door
but
the
people
in
the
doorway
had
the
advantage
of
not
having
to
look
at
him
and
he
could
very
well
dominate
the
conversation
standing
so
behind
them
why
a
praise
service
is
a
service
of
song
and
gladness
of
course
you
sing
do
you
of
course
well
what
shall
we
sing
do
you
know
this
and
she
broke
softly
into
song
when
peace
like
a
river
attendeth
my
way
when
sorrows
like
roll
whatever
my
lot
thou
hast
taught
me
to
say
it
is
well
it
is
well
with
my
soul
bud
did
not
know
the
song
but
he
did
not
intend
to
be
balked
with
the
minister
standing
right
behind
him
ready
no
doubt
to
jump
in
and
take
the
precedence
so
he
growled
away
at
a
note
in
the
bass
turning
it
over
and
over
and
trying
to
make
it
fit
like
a
dog
gnawing
at
a
bare
bone
but
he
managed
to
keep
time
and
make
it
sound
a
little
like
singing
the
dusk
was
falling
fast
as
they
finished
the
last
verse
margaret
singing
the
words
clear
and
distinct
bud
growling
unintelligibly
and
snatching
at
words
he
had
never
heard
before
once
more
margaret
sang
abide
with
me
fast
falls
the
eventide
the
darkness
deepens
lord
with
me
abide
when
other
refuge
fails
and
comforts
flee
help
of
the
helpless
oh
abide
with
me
out
on
the
lonely
trail
wending
his
way
toward
the
purple
mountain
the
silent
way
to
the
at
the
camp
in
that
clear
air
where
sound
travels
a
long
distance
the
traveler
heard
the
song
and
something
thrilled
his
soul
a
chord
that
never
had
been
touched
in
him
before
was
vibrating
and
its
echoes
would
be
heard
through
all
his
life
on
and
on
sang
margaret
just
because
she
could
not
bear
to
stop
and
hear
the
commonplace
talk
which
would
be
about
her
song
after
song
thrilled
through
the
night
wideness
the
stars
came
out
in
thick
clusters
father
tanner
had
long
ago
dropped
his
weekly
paper
and
tilted
his
chair
back
against
the
wall
with
his
eyes
half
closed
to
listen
and
his
wife
had
settled
down
comfortably
on
the
carpet
sofa
with
her
hands
nicely
folded
in
her
lap
as
if
she
were
at
church
the
minister
after
silently
surveying
the
situation
for
a
song
or
two
attempted
to
join
his
voice
to
the
chorus
he
had
a
voice
like
a
saw
but
he
did
do
much
harm
in
the
background
that
way
though
cap
did
growl
now
and
then
as
if
it
put
his
nerves
on
edge
and
by
and
by
tanner
quavered
in
with
a
note
or
two
finally
margaret
sang
sun
of
my
soul
thou
saviour
dear
it
is
not
night
if
thou
art
near
oh
may
no
cloud
arise
to
hide
thee
from
thy
servant
eyes
during
this
hymn
the
minister
had
slipped
out
the
back
door
and
gone
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
he
could
not
stand
being
in
the
background
any
longer
but
as
the
last
note
died
away
margaret
arose
and
bidding
bud
good
night
slipped
up
to
her
room
there
presently
beside
her
darkened
window
with
her
face
toward
the
mountain
she
knelt
to
pray
for
the
wanderer
who
was
trying
to
find
his
way
out
of
the
wilderness
chapter
xiii
monday
morning
found
margaret
at
the
nerved
for
her
new
task
one
by
one
the
scholars
trooped
in
shyly
or
half
defiantly
hung
their
hats
on
the
hooks
put
their
on
the
shelf
looked
furtively
at
her
and
sank
into
their
accustomed
seats
that
is
the
seats
they
had
occupied
during
the
last
term
of
school
the
big
boys
remained
outside
until
bud
acting
under
instructions
from
margaret
after
she
had
been
carefully
taught
the
ways
of
the
school
by
bud
himself
rang
the
big
bell
even
then
they
entered
reluctantly
and
as
if
it
were
a
great
condescension
that
they
came
at
all
jed
and
delicate
coming
in
last
with
scarcely
a
casual
glance
toward
the
teacher
desk
as
if
she
were
a
mere
fraction
in
the
scheme
of
the
school
she
did
not
need
to
be
told
which
was
timothy
and
which
was
jed
bud
description
had
been
perfect
her
heart
by
the
way
instantly
went
out
to
timothy
jed
was
another
proposition
he
had
thick
overhanging
eyebrows
and
a
mouth
that
loved
to
make
trouble
and
laugh
over
it
he
was
going
to
be
hard
to
conquer
she
was
sure
the
conquering
would
be
interesting
either
margaret
stood
by
the
desk
watching
them
all
with
a
pleasant
smile
she
did
not
frown
at
the
unnecessary
shuffling
of
feet
nor
the
loud
remarks
of
the
boys
as
they
settled
into
their
seats
she
just
stood
and
watched
them
interestedly
as
though
her
time
had
not
yet
come
jed
and
timothy
were
carrying
on
a
rumbling
conversation
even
after
they
took
their
seats
they
kept
it
up
it
was
no
part
of
their
plan
to
let
the
teacher
suppose
they
saw
her
or
minded
her
in
the
least
they
were
the
dominating
influences
in
that
school
and
they
wanted
her
to
know
it
right
at
the
start
then
a
lot
of
trouble
would
be
saved
if
they
did
like
her
and
could
manage
her
they
did
intend
she
should
stay
and
she
might
as
well
understand
that
at
once
margaret
understood
it
fully
yet
she
stood
quietly
and
watched
them
with
a
look
of
deep
interest
on
her
face
and
a
light
almost
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
while
bud
grew
redder
and
redder
over
the
way
his
two
idols
were
treating
the
new
teacher
one
by
one
the
school
became
aware
of
the
twinkle
in
the
teacher
eyes
and
grew
silent
to
watch
and
one
by
one
they
began
to
smile
over
the
coming
scene
when
jed
and
timothy
should
discover
it
and
worst
of
all
find
out
that
it
was
actually
directed
against
them
they
would
expect
severity
or
fear
or
a
desire
to
placate
but
a
twinkle
it
was
more
than
the
school
could
decide
what
would
happen
under
such
circumstances
no
one
in
that
room
would
ever
dare
to
laugh
at
either
of
those
two
boys
but
the
teacher
was
almost
laughing
now
and
the
twinkle
had
taken
the
rest
of
the
room
into
the
secret
while
she
waited
amusedly
until
the
two
should
finish
the
conversation
the
room
grew
suddenly
deathly
still
except
for
the
whispered
growls
of
jed
and
timothy
and
still
the
silence
deepened
until
the
two
young
giants
themselves
perceived
that
it
was
time
to
look
up
and
take
account
of
stock
the
perspiration
by
this
time
was
rolling
down
the
back
of
bud
neck
he
was
about
the
only
one
in
the
room
who
was
not
on
a
broad
grin
and
he
was
wretched
what
a
fearful
mistake
the
new
teacher
was
making
right
at
the
start
she
was
antagonizing
the
two
boys
who
held
the
whole
school
in
their
hands
there
was
no
telling
what
they
would
do
to
her
now
and
he
would
have
to
stand
up
for
her
yes
no
matter
what
they
did
he
would
stand
up
for
her
even
though
he
lost
his
best
friends
he
must
be
loyal
to
her
but
the
strain
was
terrible
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
them
but
fastened
his
eyes
upon
margaret
as
if
keeping
them
glued
there
was
his
only
hope
then
suddenly
he
saw
her
face
break
into
one
of
the
sweetest
merriest
smiles
he
ever
witnessed
with
not
one
single
hint
of
reproach
or
offended
dignity
in
it
just
a
smile
of
comradeship
understanding
and
pleasure
in
the
meeting
and
it
was
directed
to
the
two
seats
where
jed
and
timothy
sat
with
wonder
he
turned
toward
the
two
big
boys
and
saw
to
his
amazement
an
answering
smile
upon
their
faces
reluctant
is
true
half
sheepish
at
first
but
a
smile
with
lifted
eyebrows
of
astonishment
and
real
enjoyment
of
the
joke
a
little
ripple
of
approval
went
round
in
syllables
but
margaret
gave
no
time
for
any
restlessness
to
start
she
spoke
at
once
in
her
pleasantest
partnership
tone
such
as
she
had
used
to
bud
when
she
asked
him
to
help
her
build
her
bookcase
so
she
spoke
now
to
that
school
and
each
one
felt
she
was
speaking
just
to
him
especially
and
felt
a
leaping
response
in
his
soul
here
at
least
was
something
new
and
interesting
a
new
kind
of
teacher
they
kept
silence
to
listen
oh
i
not
going
to
make
a
speech
now
she
said
and
her
voice
sounded
glad
to
them
all
i
wait
till
we
know
one
another
before
i
do
that
i
just
want
to
say
how
do
you
do
to
you
and
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
to
be
here
i
hope
we
shall
like
one
another
immensely
and
have
a
great
many
good
times
together
but
we
got
to
get
acquainted
first
of
course
and
perhaps
we
better
give
most
of
the
time
to
that
first
suppose
we
sing
something
what
shall
it
be
what
do
you
sing
little
susan
johnson
by
virtue
of
having
seen
the
teacher
at
made
bold
to
raise
her
hand
and
suggest
banner
pleath
and
so
they
tried
it
but
when
margaret
found
that
only
a
few
seemed
to
know
the
words
she
said
wait
lifting
her
arm
with
a
pretty
imperative
gesture
and
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
from
the
box
on
her
desk
she
went
to
the
new
blackboard
that
stretched
its
shining
black
length
around
the
room
the
school
was
breathlessly
watching
the
graceful
movement
of
the
beautiful
hand
and
arm
over
the
smooth
surface
leaving
behind
it
the
clear
perfect
script
such
wonderful
writing
they
had
never
seen
such
perfect
easy
curves
and
twirls
every
eye
in
the
room
was
fastened
on
her
every
breath
was
held
as
they
watched
and
spelled
out
the
words
one
by
one
gee
said
bud
softly
under
his
breath
nor
knew
that
he
had
spoken
but
no
one
else
moved
now
she
said
let
us
sing
and
when
they
started
off
again
margaret
strong
clear
soprano
leading
every
voice
in
the
room
growled
out
the
words
and
tried
to
get
in
step
with
the
tune
they
had
gone
thus
through
two
verses
when
jed
seemed
to
think
it
was
about
time
to
start
something
things
were
going
altogether
too
smoothly
for
an
untried
teacher
if
she
handsome
and
unabashed
if
they
went
on
like
this
the
scholars
would
lose
all
respect
for
him
so
being
quite
able
to
sing
a
clear
tenor
he
nevertheless
puckered
his
lips
impertinently
drew
his
brows
in
an
ominous
frown
and
began
to
whistle
a
somewhat
erratic
accompaniment
to
the
song
he
watched
the
teacher
closely
expecting
to
see
the
color
flame
in
her
cheeks
the
anger
flash
in
her
eyes
he
had
tried
this
trick
on
other
teachers
and
it
always
worked
he
gave
the
wink
to
timothy
and
he
too
left
off
his
glorious
bass
and
began
to
whistle
but
instead
of
the
anger
and
annoyance
they
expected
margaret
turned
appreciative
eyes
toward
the
two
back
seats
nodding
her
head
a
trifle
and
smiling
with
her
eyes
as
she
sang
and
when
the
verse
was
done
she
held
up
her
hand
for
silence
and
said
why
boys
that
beautiful
let
try
that
verse
once
more
and
you
two
whistle
the
accompaniment
a
little
stronger
in
the
chorus
or
how
would
it
do
if
you
just
came
in
on
the
chorus
i
believe
that
would
be
more
effective
let
try
the
first
verse
that
way
you
boys
sing
during
the
verse
and
then
whistle
the
chorus
just
as
you
did
now
we
really
need
your
voices
in
the
verse
part
they
are
so
strong
and
splendid
let
try
it
now
and
she
started
off
again
the
two
big
astonished
fellows
meekly
doing
as
they
were
told
and
really
the
effect
was
beautiful
what
was
their
surprise
when
the
whole
song
was
finished
to
have
her
say
now
everybody
whistle
the
chorus
softly
and
then
pucker
up
her
own
soft
lips
to
join
in
that
completely
finished
the
whistling
stunt
jed
realized
that
it
would
never
work
again
not
while
she
was
here
for
she
had
turned
the
joke
into
beauty
and
made
them
all
enjoy
it
it
had
annoyed
her
in
the
least
somehow
by
that
time
they
were
all
ready
for
anything
she
had
to
suggest
and
they
watched
again
breathlessly
as
she
wrote
another
song
on
the
blackboard
taking
the
other
side
of
the
room
for
it
and
this
time
a
hymn
i
need
thee
every
hour
when
they
began
to
sing
it
however
margaret
found
the
tune
went
slowly
uncertainly
oh
how
we
need
a
piano
she
exclaimed
i
wonder
if
we
ca
get
up
an
entertainment
and
raise
money
to
buy
one
how
many
will
help
every
hand
in
the
place
went
up
jed
and
timothy
last
and
only
a
little
way
but
she
noted
with
triumph
that
they
went
up
all
right
we
do
it
now
let
sing
that
verse
correctly
and
she
began
to
sing
again
while
they
all
joined
anxiously
in
really
trying
to
do
their
best
the
instant
the
last
verse
died
away
margaret
voice
took
their
attention
two
years
ago
in
boston
two
young
men
who
belonged
to
a
little
group
of
christian
workers
who
were
going
around
from
place
to
place
holding
meetings
sat
talking
together
in
their
room
in
the
hotel
one
evening
there
was
instant
quiet
a
kind
of
a
breathless
quiet
this
was
not
like
the
beginning
of
any
lesson
any
other
teacher
had
ever
given
them
every
eye
was
fixed
on
her
they
had
been
talking
over
the
work
of
the
day
and
finally
one
of
them
suggested
that
they
choose
a
bible
verse
for
the
whole
year
there
was
a
movement
of
impatience
from
one
back
seat
as
if
jed
had
scented
an
incipient
sermon
but
the
teacher
voice
went
steadily
on
they
talked
it
over
and
at
last
they
settled
on
ii
timothy
they
made
up
their
minds
to
use
it
on
every
possible
occasion
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
so
the
man
whose
room
adjoined
got
up
and
instead
of
saying
good
night
he
said
ii
timothy
and
went
to
his
room
pretty
soon
when
he
put
out
his
light
he
knocked
on
the
wall
and
shouted
timothy
and
the
other
man
responded
heartily
right
ii
timothy
the
next
morning
when
they
wrote
their
letters
each
of
them
wrote
timothy
on
the
lower
corner
of
the
envelope
and
sent
out
a
great
handful
of
letters
to
all
parts
of
the
world
those
letters
passed
through
the
boston
and
some
of
the
clerks
who
sorted
them
saw
that
queer
legend
written
down
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
envelope
and
they
wondered
at
it
and
one
or
two
wrote
it
down
to
look
it
up
afterward
the
letters
reached
other
cities
and
were
put
into
the
hands
of
to
distribute
and
they
saw
the
queer
little
sentence
timothy
and
they
wondered
and
some
of
them
looked
it
up
by
this
time
the
entire
attention
of
the
school
was
upon
the
story
for
they
perceived
that
it
was
a
story
the
men
left
boston
and
went
across
the
ocean
to
hold
meetings
in
other
cities
and
one
day
at
a
little
railway
station
in
europe
a
group
of
people
were
gathered
waiting
for
a
train
and
those
two
men
were
among
them
pretty
soon
the
train
came
and
one
of
the
men
got
on
the
back
end
of
the
last
car
while
the
other
stayed
on
the
platform
and
as
the
train
moved
off
the
man
on
the
last
car
took
off
his
hat
and
said
in
a
good
loud
clear
tone
take
care
of
yourself
ii
timothy
and
the
other
one
smiled
and
waved
his
hat
and
answered
ii
timothy
the
man
on
the
train
which
was
moving
fast
now
shouted
back
timothy
and
the
man
on
the
platform
responded
still
louder
waving
his
hat
timothy
and
back
and
forth
the
queer
sentence
was
flung
until
the
train
was
too
far
away
for
them
to
hear
each
other
voices
in
the
mean
time
all
the
people
on
the
platform
had
been
standing
there
listening
and
wondering
what
in
the
world
such
a
strange
salutation
could
mean
some
of
them
recognized
what
it
was
but
many
did
not
know
and
yet
the
sentence
was
said
over
so
many
times
that
they
could
not
help
remembering
it
and
some
went
away
to
recall
it
and
ask
their
friends
what
it
meant
a
young
man
from
america
was
on
that
platform
and
heard
it
and
he
knew
it
stood
for
a
passage
in
the
bible
and
his
curiosity
was
so
great
that
he
went
back
to
his
and
hunted
up
the
bible
his
mother
had
packed
in
his
trunk
when
he
came
away
from
home
and
he
hunted
through
the
bible
until
he
found
the
place
timothy
and
read
it
and
it
made
him
think
about
his
life
and
decide
that
he
was
doing
as
he
ought
to
do
i
ca
tell
you
all
the
story
about
that
queer
bible
verse
how
it
went
here
and
there
and
what
a
great
work
it
did
in
people
hearts
but
one
day
those
christian
workers
went
to
australia
to
hold
some
meetings
and
one
night
when
the
great
auditorium
was
crowded
a
man
who
was
leading
the
meeting
got
up
and
told
the
story
of
this
verse
how
it
had
been
chosen
and
how
it
had
gone
over
the
world
in
strange
ways
even
told
about
the
morning
at
the
little
railway
station
when
the
two
men
said
just
as
he
got
to
that
place
in
his
story
a
man
in
the
audience
stood
up
and
said
just
let
me
say
a
word
please
i
never
knew
anything
about
all
this
before
but
i
was
at
that
railway
station
and
i
heard
those
two
men
shout
that
strange
and
i
went
home
and
read
that
verse
and
it
made
a
great
difference
in
my
life
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
the
story
how
some
chicago
policemen
got
to
be
good
men
through
reading
that
verse
and
how
the
story
of
the
australia
meetings
was
printed
in
an
australian
paper
and
sent
to
a
lady
in
america
who
sent
it
to
a
friend
in
england
to
read
about
the
meetings
and
this
friend
in
england
had
a
son
in
the
army
in
india
to
whom
she
was
sending
a
package
and
she
wrapped
it
around
something
in
that
package
and
the
young
man
read
all
about
it
and
it
helped
to
change
his
life
well
i
thought
of
that
story
this
morning
when
i
was
trying
to
decide
what
to
read
for
our
opening
chapter
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
you
would
be
interested
to
take
that
verse
for
our
school
verse
this
term
and
so
if
you
would
like
it
i
will
put
it
on
the
blackboard
would
you
like
it
i
wonder
she
paused
wistfully
as
if
she
expected
an
answer
and
there
was
a
low
almost
inaudible
growl
of
assent
a
keen
listener
might
almost
have
said
it
had
an
impatient
quality
in
it
as
if
they
were
in
a
hurry
to
find
out
what
the
verse
was
that
had
made
such
a
stir
in
the
world
very
well
said
margaret
turning
to
the
board
then
i
put
it
where
we
all
can
see
it
and
while
i
write
it
will
you
please
say
over
where
it
is
so
that
you
will
remember
it
and
hunt
it
up
for
yourselves
in
your
bibles
at
home
there
was
a
sort
of
snicker
at
that
for
there
were
probably
not
half
a
dozen
bibles
if
there
were
so
many
represented
in
that
school
but
they
took
her
hint
as
she
wrote
and
chanted
ii
timothy
ii
timothy
and
then
spelled
out
after
her
rapid
crayon
study
to
show
thyself
approved
unto
god
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
they
read
it
together
at
her
bidding
with
a
wondering
look
in
their
faces
and
then
she
said
now
shall
we
pray
the
former
teacher
had
not
opened
her
school
with
prayer
it
had
never
been
even
suggested
in
that
school
it
might
have
been
a
dangerous
experiment
if
margaret
had
attempted
it
sooner
in
her
program
as
it
was
there
was
a
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
back
seats
at
her
first
word
but
the
room
grew
quiet
again
perhaps
out
of
curiosity
to
hear
a
woman
voice
in
prayer
our
heavenly
father
we
want
to
ask
thee
to
bless
us
in
our
work
together
and
to
help
us
to
be
such
workmen
that
we
shall
not
need
to
be
ashamed
to
show
our
work
to
thee
at
the
close
of
the
day
for
sake
we
ask
it
amen
they
did
not
have
time
to
resent
that
prayer
before
she
had
them
interested
in
something
else
in
fact
she
had
planned
her
whole
first
day
out
so
that
there
should
not
be
a
minute
for
misbehavior
she
had
argued
that
if
she
could
just
get
time
to
become
acquainted
with
them
she
might
prevent
a
lot
of
trouble
before
it
ever
started
her
first
business
was
to
win
her
scholars
after
that
she
could
teach
them
easily
if
they
were
once
willing
to
learn
she
had
a
set
of
mental
arithmetic
problems
ready
which
she
propounded
to
them
next
some
of
them
difficult
and
some
easy
enough
for
the
youngest
child
who
could
think
and
she
timed
their
answers
and
wrote
on
the
board
the
names
of
those
who
raised
their
hands
first
and
had
the
correct
answers
the
questions
were
put
in
a
fascinating
way
many
of
them
having
curious
little
catches
in
them
for
the
scholars
who
were
not
on
the
alert
and
timothy
presently
discovered
this
and
set
himself
to
get
every
one
coming
off
victorious
at
the
end
even
jed
roused
himself
and
was
interested
and
some
of
the
girls
quite
distinguished
themselves
when
a
of
this
was
over
she
put
the
word
transfiguration
on
the
blackboard
and
set
them
to
playing
a
regular
game
out
of
it
if
some
of
the
had
come
in
just
then
they
might
have
lifted
up
hands
of
horror
at
the
idea
of
the
new
teacher
setting
the
whole
school
to
playing
a
game
but
they
certainly
would
have
been
delightfully
surprised
to
see
a
quiet
and
orderly
room
with
bent
heads
and
knit
brows
all
intent
upon
papers
and
pencils
never
before
in
the
annals
of
that
school
had
the
first
day
held
a
full
period
of
quiet
or
orderliness
it
was
expected
to
be
a
day
of
battle
a
day
of
trying
out
the
soul
of
the
teacher
and
proving
whether
he
or
she
were
worthy
to
cope
with
the
active
minds
and
bodies
of
the
young
bullies
of
ashland
but
the
expected
battle
had
been
forgotten
every
mind
was
busy
with
the
matter
in
hand
margaret
had
given
them
three
minutes
to
write
as
many
words
as
they
could
think
of
of
three
letters
or
more
beginning
with
t
and
using
only
the
letters
in
the
word
she
had
put
on
the
board
when
time
was
called
there
was
a
breathless
rush
to
write
a
last
word
and
then
each
scholar
had
to
tell
how
many
words
he
had
and
each
was
called
upon
to
read
his
list
some
had
only
two
or
three
some
had
ten
or
eleven
they
were
allowed
to
mark
their
words
counting
one
for
each
person
present
who
did
not
have
that
word
and
doubling
if
it
were
two
syllables
and
so
on
excitement
ran
high
when
it
was
discovered
that
some
had
actually
made
a
count
of
thirty
or
forty
and
when
they
started
writing
words
beginning
with
r
every
head
was
bent
intently
from
the
minute
time
was
started
never
had
three
minutes
seemed
so
short
to
those
unused
brains
and
jed
yelled
out
aw
gee
i
only
got
three
when
time
was
called
next
it
was
when
they
finally
finished
every
letter
in
that
word
and
adding
all
up
found
that
timothy
had
won
the
game
was
that
school
why
a
barbecue
could
be
named
beside
it
for
fun
they
rushed
out
to
the
with
a
shout
and
the
boys
played
loudly
for
the
first
few
minutes
margaret
leaning
her
tired
head
in
her
hands
elbows
on
the
closing
her
eyes
and
gathering
strength
for
the
session
heard
one
boy
say
wal
how
d
like
and
the
answer
came
gee
i
did
think
she
be
that
kind
of
a
guy
i
thought
she
be
some
stiff
old
ike
ai
she
a
peach
though
she
lifted
up
her
head
and
laughed
triumphantly
to
herself
her
eyes
alight
herself
now
strengthened
for
the
fray
she
was
wholly
failing
then
after
recess
there
was
a
choosing
sides
of
course
because
this
is
only
the
first
day
and
we
must
get
acquainted
before
we
can
do
real
work
you
know
she
explained
the
proved
an
exciting
affair
also
with
new
features
that
ashland
had
never
seen
before
here
the
girls
began
to
shine
into
prominence
but
there
were
very
few
good
spellers
and
they
were
presently
reduced
to
two
girls
rosa
rogers
the
beauty
of
the
school
and
amanda
bounds
a
stolid
homely
girl
with
deep
eyes
and
a
broad
brow
i
going
to
give
this
as
a
prize
to
the
one
who
stands
up
the
longest
said
margaret
with
sudden
inspiration
as
she
saw
the
boys
in
their
seats
getting
restless
and
she
unpinned
a
tiny
bow
that
fastened
her
white
collar
the
girls
all
said
and
immediately
every
one
in
the
room
straightened
up
the
next
few
minutes
those
two
girls
spelled
for
dear
life
each
with
her
eye
fixed
upon
the
tiny
blue
bow
in
the
white
hands
to
own
that
bow
that
wonderful
strange
bow
of
the
heavenly
blue
with
the
graceful
twist
to
the
tie
what
delight
the
girl
who
won
that
would
be
the
admired
of
all
the
school
even
the
boys
sat
up
and
took
notice
each
secretly
thinking
that
rosa
the
beauty
would
get
it
of
course
but
she
did
she
slipped
up
on
the
word
receive
after
all
putting
the
i
before
the
e
and
her
stolid
companion
catching
her
breath
awesomely
slowly
spelled
it
right
and
received
the
blue
prize
pinned
gracefully
at
the
throat
of
her
old
brown
gingham
by
the
teacher
own
soft
white
fingers
while
the
school
looked
on
admiringly
and
the
blood
rolled
hotly
up
the
back
of
her
neck
and
spread
over
her
face
and
forehead
rosa
the
beauty
went
crestfallen
to
her
seat
it
was
at
noon
while
they
ate
their
lunch
that
margaret
tried
to
get
acquainted
with
the
girls
calling
most
of
them
by
name
to
their
great
surprise
and
hinting
of
delightful
possibilities
in
the
winter
work
then
she
slipped
out
among
the
boys
and
watched
their
sports
laughing
and
applauding
when
some
one
made
a
particularly
fine
play
as
if
she
thoroughly
understood
and
appreciated
she
managed
to
stand
near
jed
and
timothy
just
before
bud
rang
the
bell
i
heard
you
are
great
sportsmen
she
said
to
them
confidingly
and
i
been
wondering
if
you
teach
me
some
things
i
want
to
learn
i
want
to
know
how
to
ride
and
shoot
do
you
suppose
i
could
learn
sure
they
chorused
eagerly
their
embarrassment
forgotten
sure
you
could
learn
fine
sure
you
and
then
the
bell
rang
and
they
all
went
in
the
afternoon
was
a
rather
informal
arrangement
of
classes
and
schedule
for
the
next
day
margaret
giving
out
slips
of
paper
with
questions
for
each
to
answer
that
she
might
find
out
just
where
to
place
them
and
while
they
wrote
she
went
from
one
to
another
getting
acquainted
advising
and
suggesting
about
what
they
wanted
to
study
it
was
all
so
new
and
wonderful
to
them
they
had
not
been
used
to
caring
what
they
were
to
study
now
it
almost
seemed
interesting
but
when
the
day
was
done
the
locked
and
bud
and
margaret
started
for
home
she
realized
that
she
was
weary
yet
it
was
a
weariness
of
success
and
not
of
failure
and
she
felt
happy
in
looking
forward
to
the
morrow
chapter
xiv
the
minister
had
decided
to
preach
in
ashland
and
on
the
following
sabbath
it
became
apparent
that
if
he
wished
to
have
any
notice
at
all
from
the
haughty
new
teacher
he
must
do
something
at
once
to
establish
his
superiority
in
her
eyes
he
had
carefully
gone
over
his
store
of
sermons
that
he
always
carried
with
him
and
decided
to
preach
on
the
dynamics
of
altruism
notices
had
been
posted
up
in
saloons
and
stores
and
he
had
made
them
himself
after
completely
tabooing
tanner
kindly
and
blundering
attempt
and
they
gave
full
information
concerning
the
rev
frederick
west
of
the
vicinity
of
new
york
city
who
had
kindly
consented
to
preach
in
the
on
dynamics
of
altruism
several
of
these
elaborately
printed
announcements
had
been
posted
up
on
big
trees
along
the
trails
and
in
other
conspicuous
places
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
the
coming
sabbath
services
were
more
talked
of
than
anything
else
in
that
neighborhood
for
miles
around
except
the
new
teacher
and
her
extraordinary
way
of
making
all
the
scholars
fall
in
love
with
her
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
reverend
frederick
might
not
have
been
so
flattered
at
the
size
of
his
audience
when
the
day
came
if
he
could
have
known
how
many
of
them
came
principally
because
they
thought
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
see
the
new
teacher
however
the
announcements
were
read
and
the
preacher
became
an
object
of
deep
interest
to
the
community
when
he
went
abroad
under
this
attention
he
swelled
grew
pleased
bland
and
condescending
wearing
an
oily
smile
and
bowing
most
conceitedly
whenever
anybody
noticed
him
he
even
began
to
drop
his
severity
and
silence
at
the
table
toward
the
end
of
the
week
and
expanded
into
dignified
conversation
mainly
addressed
to
tanner
about
the
political
situation
in
the
state
of
arizona
he
was
trying
to
impress
the
teacher
with
the
fact
that
he
looked
upon
her
as
a
most
insignificant
mortal
who
had
forfeited
her
right
to
his
smiles
by
her
headstrong
and
unseemly
conduct
when
he
had
warned
her
about
that
young
ruffian
out
on
the
trail
long
bill
and
jasper
kemp
paused
before
a
tree
that
bore
the
reverend
frederick
church
notice
and
read
in
silence
while
the
wide
wonder
of
the
desert
spread
about
them
what

to
the
the
day
after
that
little
party
we
had
when
the
kid
shot
out

lights
to

spankin

fair
show

much
on
religion

but
i
do
like

see
a
square
deal
especially
in
a
parson
i
sized
it
up
he
needs
a
lesson
i
with
ye
jap
said
long
bill
and
the
two
rode
on
their
way
in
silence
margaret
was
so
busy
and
so
happy
with
her
school
all
the
week
that
she
quite
forgot
her
annoyance
at
the
minister
she
really
saw
very
little
of
him
for
he
was
always
late
to
breakfast
and
she
took
hers
early
she
went
to
her
room
immediately
after
supper
and
he
had
little
opportunity
for
pursuing
her
acquaintance
perhaps
he
judged
that
it
would
be
wise
to
let
her
alone
until
after
he
had
made
his
grand
impression
on
sunday
and
let
her
make
up
to
him
it
was
not
until
sunday
morning
that
she
suddenly
recalled
that
he
was
to
preach
that
day
she
had
indeed
seen
the
notices
for
a
very
large
and
elaborate
one
was
posted
in
front
of
the
and
some
anonymous
artist
had
produced
a
fine
caricature
of
the
preacher
in
red
clay
underneath
his
name
margaret
had
been
obliged
to
remain
after
school
friday
and
remove
as
much
of
this
portrait
as
she
was
able
not
having
been
willing
to
make
it
a
matter
of
discipline
to
discover
the
artist
in
fact
it
was
so
true
to
the
model
that
the
young
teacher
felt
a
growing
sympathy
for
the
one
who
had
perpetrated
it
margaret
started
to
the
early
sunday
morning
attended
by
the
faithful
bud
not
that
he
had
any
more
intention
of
going
to
than
he
had
the
week
before
but
it
was
pleasant
to
be
the
chosen
escort
of
so
popular
a
teacher
even
jed
and
timothy
had
walked
home
with
her
twice
during
the
week
he
did
not
intend
to
lose
his
place
as
nearest
to
her
there
was
only
one
to
whom
he
would
surrender
that
and
he
was
too
far
away
to
claim
it
often
margaret
had
promised
to
help
in
the
that
morning
for
the
woman
who
taught
the
little
ones
was
still
away
with
her
sick
neighbor
and
on
the
way
she
persuaded
bud
to
help
her
you
be
secretary
for
me
wo
you
william
she
asked
brightly
i
going
to
take
the
corner
of
the
room
for
the
children
and
seat
them
on
the
and
that
will
leave
all
the
back
part
of
the
room
for
the
older
people
then
i
can
use
the
blackboard
and
not
disturb
the
rest
secretary
asked
the
astonished
bud
he
was
so
to
speak
growing
accustomed
to
surprises
secretary
did
not
sound
like
being
a
nice
little
boy
why
yes
take
up
the
collection
and
see
who
is
absent
and
so
on
i
do
know
all
the
names
perhaps
and
anyhow
i
do
like
to
do
that
when
i
have
to
teach
artful
margaret
she
had
no
mind
to
leave
bud
floating
around
outside
the
and
though
she
had
ostensibly
prepared
her
lesson
and
her
blackboard
illustration
for
the
little
children
she
had
hidden
in
it
a
truth
for
bud
poor
neglected
devoted
bud
the
inefficient
old
man
who
taught
the
older
people
that
day
gathered
his
forces
together
and
seated
with
his
back
to
the
platform
his
spectacles
extended
upon
his
long
nose
he
proceeded
with
the
questions
on
the
as
usual
being
more
than
ordinarily
unfamiliar
with
them
but
before
he
was
half
through
he
perceived
by
the
long
pauses
between
the
questions
and
answers
that
he
did
not
have
the
attention
of
his
class
he
turned
slowly
around
to
see
what
they
were
all
looking
at
and
became
so
engaged
in
listening
to
the
lesson
the
new
teacher
was
drawing
on
the
blackboard
that
he
completely
forgot
to
go
on
until
bud
very
important
in
his
new
position
rang
the
tiny
for
the
close
of
school
and
margaret
looking
up
saw
in
dismay
that
she
had
been
teaching
the
whole
school
while
they
were
singing
a
closing
hymn
the
room
began
to
fill
up
and
presently
came
the
minister
walking
importantly
beside
tanner
his
chin
flattened
upward
as
usual
but
bent
in
till
it
made
a
double
roll
over
his
collar
his
eyes
rolling
importantly
showing
much
of
their
whites
his
sermon
in
an
elaborate
leather
cover
carried
conspicuously
under
his
arm
and
the
severest
of
clerical
coats
and
collars
setting
out
his
insignificant
face
walking
behind
him
in
single
file
measured
step
just
so
far
apart
came
the
eight
men
from
the
long
bill
big
jim
fiddling
boss
jasper
kemp
forbes
stocky
croaker
and
fudge
and
behind
them
looking
like
a
scared
rabbit
mom
wallis
scuttled
into
the
back
seat
and
sank
out
of
sight
the
eight
men
however
ranged
themselves
across
the
front
of
the
room
on
the
directly
in
front
of
the
platform
removing
a
few
small
children
for
that
purpose
they
had
been
lined
up
in
a
scowling
row
along
the
path
as
the
minister
entered
looking
at
them
askance
under
his
aristocratic
yellow
eyebrows
and
as
he
neared
the
door
the
last
man
followed
in
his
wake
then
the
next
and
so
on
margaret
in
her
seat
back
at
the
side
of
the
near
a
window
saw
through
the
trees
a
wide
sombrero
over
a
pair
of
broad
shoulders
but
though
she
kept
close
watch
she
did
not
see
her
friend
of
the
wilderness
enter
the
if
he
had
really
come
to
meeting
he
was
staying
outside
the
minister
was
rather
nonplussed
at
first
that
there
were
no
it
almost
seemed
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
go
on
with
divine
service
without
but
at
last
he
compromised
on
the
doxology
pronounced
with
deliberate
unction
then
looking
about
for
a
possible
and
choir
he
finally
started
it
himself
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
one
would
have
recognized
the
tune
enough
to
help
it
on
if
margaret
had
not
for
very
shame
sake
taken
it
up
and
carried
it
along
and
so
they
came
to
the
prayer
and
these
were
performed
with
a
formal
perfunctory
style
calculated
to
impress
the
audience
with
the
importance
of
the
preacher
rather
than
the
words
he
was
speaking
the
audience
was
very
quiet
having
the
air
of
reserving
judgment
for
the
sermon
margaret
could
not
just
remember
afterward
how
it
was
she
missed
the
text
she
had
turned
her
eyes
away
from
the
minister
because
it
somehow
made
her
feel
homesick
to
compare
him
with
her
dear
dignified
father
her
mind
had
wandered
perhaps
to
the
sombrero
she
had
glimpsed
outside
and
she
was
wondering
how
its
owner
was
coming
on
with
his
resolves
and
just
what
change
they
would
mean
in
his
life
anyway
then
suddenly
she
awoke
to
the
fact
that
the
sermon
had
begun
chapter
xv
considered
in
the
world
of
physics
began
the
lordly
tones
of
the
reverend
frederick
dynamics
is
that
branch
of
mechanics
that
treats
of
the
effects
of
forces
in
producing
motion
and
of
the
laws
of
motion
thus
produced
sometimes
called
kinetics
opposed
to
statics
it
is
the
science
that
treats
of
the
laws
of
force
whether
producing
equilibrium
or
motion
in
this
sense
including
both
statics
and
kinetics
it
is
also
applied
to
the
forces
producing
or
governing
activity
or
movement
of
any
kind
also
the
methods
of
such
activity
the
big
words
rolled
out
magnificently
over
the
awed
gathering
and
the
minister
flattened
his
chin
and
rolled
his
eyes
up
at
the
people
in
his
most
impressive
way
margaret
gaze
hastily
sought
the
row
of
rough
men
on
the
front
seat
sitting
with
folded
arms
in
an
attitude
of
attention
each
man
with
a
pair
of
intelligent
eyes
under
his
shaggy
brows
regarding
the
preacher
as
they
might
have
regarded
an
animal
in
a
zoo
did
they
understand
what
had
been
said
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
their
serious
faces
philanthropy
has
been
called
the
dynamics
of
christianity
that
is
to
say
it
is
christianity
in
action
went
on
the
preacher
it
is
my
purpose
this
morning
to
speak
upon
the
dynamics
of
altruism
now
altruism
is
the
theory
that
inculcates
benevolence
to
others
in
subordination
to
interested
benevolence
as
opposed
to
disinterested
also
the
practice
of
this
theory
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
audience
once
more
and
nodded
his
head
slightly
as
if
to
emphasize
the
deep
truth
he
had
just
given
them
and
the
battery
of
keen
eyes
before
him
never
flinched
from
his
face
they
were
searching
him
through
and
through
margaret
wondered
if
he
had
no
sense
of
the
ridiculous
that
he
could
to
such
an
audience
pour
forth
such
a
string
of
technical
definitions
they
sounded
strangely
like
dictionary
language
she
wondered
if
anybody
present
besides
herself
knew
what
the
man
meant
or
got
any
inkling
of
what
his
subject
was
surely
he
would
drop
to
simpler
language
now
that
he
had
laid
out
his
plan
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
man
was
trying
to
impress
with
his
wonderful
fluency
of
language
and
his
marvelous
store
of
wisdom
on
and
on
he
went
in
much
the
same
trend
he
had
begun
with
now
and
then
a
flowery
sentence
or
whole
paragraph
of
meaningless
eloquence
about
the
brotherhood
of
man
with
a
roll
to
the
r
in
brotherhood
fifteen
minutes
of
this
profitless
oratory
those
men
of
the
wilderness
endured
stolidly
and
with
fixed
attention
then
suddenly
a
sentence
of
unusual
simplicity
struck
them
and
an
almost
visible
thrill
went
down
the
front
seat
for
years
the
church
has
preached
a
dead
faith
without
works
my
friends
and
the
time
has
come
to
stop
preaching
faith
i
repeat
it
i
repeat
it
the
time
has
come
stop
preaching
and
begin
to
do
good
works
he
thumped
the
desk
vehemently
men
do
need
a
superstitious
belief
in
a
saviour
to
save
them
from
their
sins
they
need
to
go
to
work
and
save
themselves
as
if
a
man
dying
two
thousand
years
ago
on
a
cross
could
do
any
good
to
you
and
me
it
was
then
that
the
thrill
passed
down
that
front
line
and
long
bill
sitting
at
their
head
leaned
slightly
forward
and
looked
full
and
frowning
into
the
face
of
jasper
kemp
and
the
latter
frowning
back
solemnly
winked
one
eye
margaret
sat
where
she
could
see
the
whole
thing
immediately
still
with
studied
gravity
long
bill
cleared
his
throat
impressively
arose
and
giving
the
minister
a
full
look
in
the
eye
of
the
nature
almost
of
a
challenge
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
noisily
down
the
aisle
and
out
the
front
door
the
minister
was
visibly
annoyed
and
for
the
moment
a
trifle
flustered
but
concluding
his
remarks
had
been
too
deep
for
the
rough
creature
he
gathered
up
the
thread
of
his
argument
and
proceeded
we
need
to
get
to
work
at
our
duty
toward
our
we
need
to
down
trusts
and
give
the
a
chance
we
need
to
stop
insisting
that
men
shall
believe
in
the
inspiration
of
the
entire
bible
and
get
to
work
at
something
practical
the
impressive
pause
after
this
sentence
was
interrupted
by
a
sharp
rasping
sound
of
big
jim
clearing
his
throat
and
shuffling
to
his
feet
he
too
looked
the
minister
full
in
the
face
with
a
searching
gaze
shook
his
head
sadly
and
walked
leisurely
down
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
door
the
minister
paused
again
and
frowned
this
was
becoming
annoying
margaret
sat
in
startled
wonder
could
it
be
possible
that
these
rough
men
were
objecting
to
the
sermon
from
a
theological
point
of
view
or
was
it
just
a
happening
that
they
had
gone
out
at
such
pointed
moments
she
sat
back
after
a
minute
telling
herself
that
of
course
the
men
must
just
have
been
weary
of
the
long
sentences
which
no
doubt
they
could
not
understand
she
began
to
hope
that
gardley
was
not
within
hearing
it
was
not
probable
that
many
others
understood
enough
to
get
harm
from
the
sermon
but
her
soul
boiled
with
indignation
that
a
man
could
go
forth
and
call
himself
a
minister
of
an
evangelical
church
and
yet
talk
such
terrible
heresy
big
jim
steps
died
slowly
away
on
the
clay
path
outside
and
the
preacher
resumed
his
discourse
we
have
preached
long
enough
of
hell
and
torment
it
is
time
for
a
gospel
of
love
to
our
brothers
hell
is
a
superstition
of
the
dark
ages
is
no
hell
fiddling
boss
turned
sharply
toward
jasper
kemp
as
if
waiting
for
a
signal
and
jasper
gave
a
slight
almost
imperceptible
nod
whereupon
fiddling
boss
cleared
his
throat
loudly
and
arose
faced
the
minister
and
marched
down
the
aisle
while
jasper
kemp
remained
quietly
seated
as
if
nothing
had
happened
a
vacancy
each
side
of
him
by
this
time
the
color
began
to
rise
in
the
minister
cheeks
he
looked
at
the
retreating
back
of
fiddling
boss
and
then
suspiciously
down
at
the
row
of
men
but
every
one
of
them
sat
with
folded
arms
and
eyes
intent
upon
the
sermon
as
if
their
comrades
had
not
left
them
the
minister
thought
he
must
have
been
mistaken
and
took
up
the
broken
thread
once
more
or
tried
to
but
he
had
hopelessly
lost
the
place
in
his
manuscript
and
the
only
clue
that
offered
was
a
quotation
of
a
poem
about
the
devil
to
be
sure
the
connection
was
somewhat
abrupt
but
he
clutched
it
with
his
eye
gratefully
and
began
reading
it
dramatically
do
believe
in
the
devil
now
as
their
fathers
used
to
do
but
he
had
got
no
further
when
a
whole
of
throats
sounded
and
forbes
stumbled
to
his
feet
frantically
bolting
down
the
aisle
as
if
he
had
been
sent
for
he
had
not
quite
reached
the
door
when
stocky
clumped
after
him
followed
at
intervals
by
croaker
and
fudge
and
each
just
as
the
minister
had
begun
um
ah
to
resume
and
now
only
jasper
kemp
remained
of
the
his
fine
gray
eyes
boring
through
and
through
the
minister
as
he
floundered
through
the
remaining
portion
of
his
manuscript
up
to
the
point
where
it
began
and
finally
which
opened
with
another
poem
need
no
christ
to
die
for
me
the
sturdy
scotchman
suddenly
lowered
his
folded
arms
slapping
a
hand
resoundingly
on
each
knee
bent
his
shoulders
the
better
to
pull
himself
to
his
feet
pressing
his
weight
on
his
hands
till
his
elbows
were
akimbo
uttered
a
deep
sigh
and
a
yes
well
with
that
he
got
to
his
feet
and
dragged
them
slowly
out
of
the
by
this
time
the
minister
was
ready
to
burst
with
indignation
never
before
in
all
the
bombastic
days
of
his
egotism
had
he
been
so
grossly
insulted
and
by
such
rude
creatures
and
yet
there
was
really
nothing
that
could
be
said
or
done
these
men
appeared
to
be
simple
creatures
who
had
wandered
in
idly
perhaps
for
a
few
moments
amusement
and
finding
the
discourse
above
their
caliber
had
innocently
wandered
out
again
that
was
the
way
it
had
been
made
to
appear
but
his
plans
had
been
cruelly
upset
by
such
actions
and
he
was
mortified
in
the
extreme
his
face
was
purple
with
his
emotions
and
he
struggled
and
spluttered
for
a
way
out
of
his
trying
dilemma
at
last
he
spoke
and
his
voice
was
absurdly
dignified
is
there
ah
any
other
ah
auditor
ah
who
is
desirous
of
withdrawing
before
the
close
of
service
if
so
he
may
do
so
now
or
ah
he
paused
for
a
suitable
ending
and
familiar
words
rushed
to
his
lips
without
consciousness
for
the
moment
of
their
meaning
or
forever
after
hold
their
peace
ah
there
was
a
deathly
silence
in
the
no
one
offered
to
go
out
and
margaret
suddenly
turned
her
head
and
looked
out
of
the
window
her
emotions
were
almost
beyond
her
control
thus
the
closing
eloquence
proceeded
to
its
finish
and
at
last
the
service
was
over
margaret
looked
about
for
mom
wallis
but
she
had
disappeared
she
signed
to
bud
and
together
they
hastened
out
but
a
quiet
sabbath
peace
reigned
about
the
door
of
the
and
not
a
man
from
the
camp
was
in
sight
no
nor
even
the
horses
upon
which
they
had
come
and
yet
when
the
minister
had
finished
shaking
hands
with
the
worshipful
women
and
a
few
men
and
children
and
came
with
tanner
to
the
door
of
the
those
eight
men
stood
in
a
solemn
row
four
on
each
side
of
the
walk
each
holding
his
chin
in
his
right
hand
his
right
elbow
in
his
left
hand
and
all
eyes
on
jasper
kemp
who
kept
his
eyes
thoughtfully
up
in
the
sky
aire
yeh
tanner
pleasant
mind
steppin
on
a
bit
we
men
wanta
have
a
word
with
the
parson
tanner
stepped
on
hurriedly
and
the
minister
was
left
standing
nonplussed
and
alone
in
the
doorway
of
the
chapter
xvi
um
ah
began
the
minister
trying
to
summon
his
best
clerical
manner
to
meet
what
he
did
not
know
it
was
best
to
assume
they
were
a
penitent
band
of
inquirers
for
the
truth
but
the
memory
of
their
recent
exodus
from
the
service
was
rather
too
clearly
in
his
mind
for
his
pleasantest
expression
to
be
uppermost
toward
these
rough
creatures
insolent
fellows
he
ought
to
give
them
a
good
lesson
in
behavior
um
ah
he
began
again
but
found
to
his
surprise
that
his
remarks
thus
far
had
had
no
effect
whatever
on
the
eight
stolid
countenances
before
him
in
fact
they
seemed
to
have
grown
grim
and
menacing
even
in
their
quiet
attitude
and
their
eyes
were
fulfilling
the
promise
of
the
look
they
had
given
him
when
they
left
the
service
what
does
all
this
mean
anyway
he
burst
forth
suddenly
calm
yourself
elder
calm
yourself
spoke
up
long
bill
there
any
occasion
to
get
excited
i
not
an
elder
i
a
minister
of
the
gospel
exploded
west
in
his
most
pompous
tones
i
should
like
to
know

you
are
and
what

this
means

quite
well
we
agoin

band
of
what
we
are
we
it
was
jasper
kemp
of
the
keen
eyes
and
sturdy
countenance
who
spoke
and
we
come
here
in
brotherly
love
to
exercise
a
little
of
that
dynamic
force
of
altruism
you
was
about
we
just
thought
we
begin
on
you
so
you
could
see
that
we
got
some
works
to
go
with
our
faith
what
do
you
mean
sir
said
west
looking
from
one
grim
countenance
to
another
i
i
do
quite
understand
the
minister
was
beginning
to
be
frightened
he
could
exactly
tell
why
he
wished
he
had
kept
brother
tanner
with
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
thought
of
tanner
as
brother
we
mean
just
this
parson
you
been
talkin
a
lot
of
lies
in
there
about
there
bein
no
saviour
an
no
hell
ner
no
devil

while

ai
much
credit
to
god

of
that
there

talkin
about
an
teach

better
you
see
it
real
brotherly
kindness
parson
an
now
we
goin
to
give
you
a
sample
of
that
dynamics
you
spoke
about
are
you
ready
boys
all
ready
they
cried
as
one
man
there
seemed
to
be
no
concerted
motion
nor
was
there
warning
swifter
than
the
weaver
shuttle
sudden
as
the
lightning
flash
the
minister
was
caught
from
where
he
stood
pompously
in
that
doorway
hat
in
hand
all
grandly
as
he
was
attired
and
hurled
from
man
to
man
across
the
walk
and
back
across
and
back
across
and
back
until
it
seemed
to
him
it
was
a
thousand
miles
all
in
a
minute
of
time
he
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
for
the
onslaught
he
jammed
his
high
silk
hat
wherewith
he
had
thought
to
overawe
the
community
upon
his
sleek
head
and
grasped
his
precious
to
his
breast
the
sermon
as
it
well
deserved
was
flung
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
fortunately
was
no
more
that
is
existing
as
a
whole
the
time
came
when
each
of
those
eight
men
recovered
and
retained
a
portion
of
that
learned
oration
and
mom
wallis
not
quite
understanding
pinned
up
and
used
as
a
sort
of
shrine
the
portion
about
doubting
the
devil
but
as
a
sermon
the
parts
were
never
assembled
on
this
earth
nor
could
be
for
some
of
it
was
ground
to
powder
under
eight
pairs
of
ponderous
heels
but
the
minister
at
that
trying
moment
was
too
much
otherwise
engaged
to
notice
that
the
child
of
his
brain
lay
scattered
on
the
ground
seven
times
he
made
the
round
up
and
down
up
and
down
that
merciless
group
tossed
like
a
from
man
to
man
and
at
last
when
his
breath
was
gone
when
the
world
had
grown
black
before
him
and
he
felt
smaller
and
more
inadequate
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
whole
conceited
life
before
he
found
himself
bound
helplessly
bound
and
cast
ignominiously
into
a
wagon
and
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
though
seemingly
but
five
short
minutes
before
the
place
had
been
swarming
with
worshipful
admirers
thanking
him
for
his
sermon
now
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
creature
within
hearing
for
he
called
and
cried
aloud
and
roared
with
his
raucous
voice
until
it
would
seem
that
all
the
surrounding
states
might
have
heard
that
cry
from
arizona
yet
none
came
to
his
relief
they
carried
him
away
somewhere
he
did
not
know
where
it
was
a
lonely
spot
and
near
a
when
he
protested
and
loudly
blamed
them
threatening
all
the
law
in
the
land
upon
them
they
regarded
him
as
one
might
a
naughty
child
who
needed
chastisement
leniently
and
with
sorrow
but
also
with
determination
they
took
him
down
by
the
water
side
and
stood
him
up
among
them
he
began
to
tremble
with
fear
as
he
looked
from
one
to
another
for
he
was
not
a
man
of
courage
and
he
had
heard
strange
tales
of
this
wild
free
land
where
every
man
was
a
law
unto
himself
were
they
going
to
drown
him
then
and
there
then
up
spoke
jasper
kemp
parson
he
said
and
his
voice
was
kind
but
firm
one
might
almost
say
there
was
a
hint
of
humor
in
it
and
there
surely
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
but
the
sternness
of
his
lips
belied
it
and
the
minister
was
in
no
state
to
appreciate
humor
parson
we
brought
you
here
to
do
you
good
an
you
ought
to
complain
this
is
altruism
an
but
actin
out
what
you
been
preachin
you
our
brother
an

nothing

folks

too
ready
to
believe

there
things
you
was
off
without
havin
to
justify
in
their
evil
ways
we
got
ta
think
of
those
poor
ignorant
brothers
of
ours
that
might
listen
to
you
see
that
the
of
it
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
the
wretched
man
tone
was
not
merely
humble
it
was
abject
his
grand
prince
albert
coat
was
torn
in
three
places
one
tail
hung
down
dejectedly
over
his
hip
one
sleeve
was
ripped
out
his
collar
was
unbuttoned
and
the
ends
rode
up
hilariously
over
his
cheeks
his
necktie
was
gone
his
sleek
hair
stuck
out
in
damp
wisps
about
his
frightened
eyes
and
his
hat
had
been
stove
in
and
jammed
down
as
far
as
it
would
go
until
his
ample
ears
stuck
out
like
sails
at
his
feet
were
imbedded
in
the
heavy
mud
on
the
margin
of
the
and
his
fine
silk
socks
which
had
showed
at
one
time
above
the
erstwhile
neat
tyings
were
torn
and
covered
with
mud
well
in
the
first
place
said
jasper
kemp
with
a
slow
wink
around
at
the
company
that
little
matter
about
hell
needs
adjustin
hell
no
superstition
i
ai
dictatin
what
kind
of
a
hell
there
is
you
can
make
it
fire
or
water
or
anything
else
you
like
but
is
a
an
believe
in
d
understand
we
just
like
to
have
you
make
that
statement
publicly
right
here
an
now
but
how
can
i
say
what
i
do
believe
whined
west
almost
ready
to
cry
he
had
come
proudly
through
a
trial
by
presbytery
on
these
very
same
points
and
had
posed
as
being
a
man
who
had
the
courage
of
his
convictions
he
could
not
thus
easily
surrender
his
pride
of
original
thought
and
he
had
received
congratulations
from
a
number
of
noble
martyrs
who
had
left
their
chosen
church
for
just
such
reasons
congratulating
him
on
his
brave
stand
it
had
been
the
first
notice
from
big
men
he
had
ever
been
able
to
attract
to
himself
and
it
had
gone
to
his
head
like
wine
give
that
up
for
a
few
miserable
cowboys
it
might
get
into
the
papers
and
go
back
east
he
must
think
of
his
reputation
that
just
where
the
dynamics
of
the
thing
comes
in
brother
said
jasper
kemp
patronizingly
we
here
to
you
believe
in
a
hell
we
the
force
that
will
bring
you
back
into
the
right
way
of
again
are
you
ready
boys
the
quiet
utterance
brought
up
to
west
very
ears
and
his
eyes
bulged
with
horror
oh
that
is
necessary
i
believe
yes
i
believe
in
hell
he
shouted
as
they
seized
him
but
it
was
too
late
the
rev
frederick
west
was
plunged
into
the
from
whose
waters
he
came
up
spluttering
yes
i
believe
in
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
perhaps
he
really
did
believe
in
it
and
thought
that
he
was
in
it
the
men
were
standing
in
the
water
and
holding
their
captive
lightly
by
his
arms
and
legs
their
eyes
upon
their
leader
waiting
now
jasper
kemp
stood
in
the
water
also
looking
down
benevolently
upon
his
victim
his
chin
in
his
hand
his
elbow
in
his
other
hand
an
attitude
which
carried
a
feeling
of
hopelessness
to
the
frightened
minister
an
now
there
that
little
matter
of
the
devil
said
jasper
kemp
reflectively
we
just
fix
that
up
next
while
we
near
his
place
of
residence
you
believe
in
the
devil
parson
from
now
on
if
ever
tried
resistin
him
i
figger
you
have
in
him
long
ago
but
believe
in
from
an
you
preach
against
him
any
we
not
goin
to
have
our
arizona
men
gettin
off
their
guard
an
thinkin
their
enemy
is
dead
there
a
devil
parson
and
you
believe
in
him
duck
him
boys
down
went
the
minister
into
the
water
again
and
came
up
spluttering
yes
i
i
i
believe
devil
even
in
this
strait
he
was
loath
to
surrender
his
pet
theme
no
devil
very
well
so
far
as
it
goes
said
jasper
kemp
thoughtfully
but
now
boys
we
comin
to
the
most
important
of
all
and
you
better
put
him
under
about
three
times
for
there
must
be
no
mistake
about
this
matter
you
believe
in
the
bible
parson
whole
yes
gasped
west
as
he
went
down
the
first
time
and
got
a
mouthful
of
the
bitter
water
i
believe
the
voice
was
fairly
anguished
down
he
went
again
another
mouthful
of
water
believe
in
the
whole
bible
he
screamed
and
went
down
the
third
time
his
voice
was
growing
weaker
but
he
came
up
and
reiterated
it
without
request
and
was
lifted
out
upon
the
mud
for
a
brief
respite
the
men
of
the
were
succeeding
better
than
the
presbytery
back
in
the
east
had
been
able
to
do
the
conceit
was
no
longer
visible
in
the
face
of
the
reverend
frederick
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
was
beginning
to
see
one
really
needed
to
believe
in
something
when
one
came
as
near
to
his
end
as
this
there
just
one
more
thing
to
reckon
with
said
jasper
kemp
thoughtfully
that
line
of
talk
you
was
handin
out
about
a
man
on
a
cross
two
thousand
years
ago
bein
nothin
to
you
you
said
you
but
you
can
speak
for
we
may
not
be
much
to
look
at
but
we
ai
goin
to
stand
for
no
such
slander
as
that
our
missionary
preaches
all
about
that
man
on
the
cross
an
if
you
need
him
before
you
get
through
this
little
campaign
of
life
i
miss
my
guess
mebbe
we
have
been
all
we
might
have
been
but
we
agoin
to
let
you
ner
no
one
else
go
back
on
that
there
cross
jasper
kemp
tone
was
tender
and
solemn
as
the
minister
lay
panting
upon
his
back
in
the
mud
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
at
only
two
other
times
in
his
life
had
a
tone
of
voice
so
arrested
his
attention
and
filled
him
with
awe
once
when
as
a
boy
he
had
been
caught
copying
off
another
paper
at
and
he
had
been
sent
to
the
principal
office
and
again
on
the
occasion
of
his
mother
funeral
as
he
sat
in
the
dim
church
a
few
years
ago
and
listened
to
the
old
minister
for
a
moment
now
he
was
impressed
with
the
wonder
of
the
cross
and
it
suddenly
seemed
as
if
he
were
being
arraigned
before
the
eyes
of
him
with
whom
we
all
have
to
do
a
kind
of
shame
stole
into
his
pale
flabby
face
all
the
smugness
and
complacence
gone
and
he
a
poor
wretch
in
the
hands
of
his
accusers
jasper
kemp
standing
over
him
on
the
bank
looking
down
grimly
upon
him
seemed
like
the
emissary
of
god
sent
to
condemn
him
and
his
little
soul
quailed
within
him
along
near
the
end
of
that
discourse
of
yours
you
mentioned
that
sin
was
only
misplaced
energy
well
if
that
so
there
a
heap
of
your
energy
gone
astray
this
mornin
an
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
pay
up
speak
up
now
an
say
what
you
believe
or
whether
you
want
another
duckin
an
it
be
seven
times
this
time
the
man
on
the
ground
shut
his
eyes
and
gasped
the
silence
was
very
solemn
there
seemed
no
hint
of
the
ridiculous
in
the
situation
it
was
serious
business
now
to
all
those
men
their
eyes
were
on
their
leader
do
you
solemnly
declare
before
god
i
you
still
believe
in
a
god
as
you
did
say
nothin
to
the
contrary
that
from
now
on
stand
for
that
there
cross
and
for
him
that
hung
on
it
the
minister
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
into
the
wide
brightness
of
the
sky
as
if
he
half
expected
to
see
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
standing
about
to
do
battle
with
him
then
and
there
and
his
voice
was
awed
and
frightened
as
he
said
i
do
there
was
silence
and
the
men
stood
with
heads
as
if
some
solemn
service
were
being
performed
that
they
did
not
quite
understand
but
in
which
they
fully
sympathized
then
jasper
kemp
said
softly
amen
and
after
a
pause
i
ai
any
sort
of
a
christian
myself
but
i
just
ca
stand
it
to
see
a
parson
floatin
round
that
do
even
know
the
name
of
the
firm
he
workin
for
now
parson
there
just
one
more
requirement
an
then
you
can
go
home
the
minister
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
with
a
frightened
appeal
but
no
one
moved
and
jasper
kemp
went
on
you
say
you
had
a
church
in
new
york
what
was
the
name
and
address
of
your
up
there

boss

that
hired
you

paid
you
the
chief
elder
or
whatever
you
called
him
oh
the
minister
tone
expressed
lack
of
interest
in
the
subject
but
he
answered
languidly
ezekiel
newbold
hazelton
very
good
now
parson

kindly

two
copies
of
a
letter

little
matter

record

your
mind

in
future

my
idea
yes
said
the
minister
dispiritedly
will
you
do
it
yes
apathetically
well
now
i
got
a
piece
of
advice
for
you
it
would
be
just
as
well
for
your
health
for
you
to
leave
arizona
about
as
quick
as
you
can
find
it
convenient
to
pack
but
you
wo
be
allowed

leave
this
town
day
or
night
cars
or
afoot
until
them
there
letters
are
all
do
you
get
me
yes
pathetically
i
might
add
by
way
of
explainin
that
if
you
had
come
to
arizona
minded
your
own
business
you
would
have
been
interfered
with
you
mighta
preached
whatever
bosh
you
darned
pleased
so
far
as
we
was
concerned
only
you
would
have
had
no
sorta
audience
after
the
first
try
of
that
stuff
you
give
but
when
you
come
to
arizona
an
put
your
fingers
in
other
folks
pie
when
you
tried
to
on
the
young
gentleman
who
was
keen
enough
to
shoot
out
the
lights
to
save
a
man
life
why
we
no
further
use
for
you
in
the
first
place
you
was
all
wrong
you
thought
the
kid
shot
out
the
lights
to
steal
the
but
he
did
he
put
it
all
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
some
hours
before
your
information
reached
him
through
the
mail
you
thought
you
were
awful
sharp
you
little
sneak
but
i
the
only
man
present
who
saw
you
put
your
foot
out
an
cover
a
gold
piece
that
rolled
on
the
floor
just
when
the
fight
began
you
thought
nobody
was
but
you
favor
us
please
with
that
identical
gold
piece
along
with
the
letter
before
you
leave
well
boys
be
about
all
then
untie
him
in
silence
and
with
a
kind
of
contemptuous
pity
in
their
faces
the
strong
men
stooped
and
unbound
him
then
without
another
word
they
left
him
tramping
solemnly
away
single
file
to
their
horses
standing
at
a
little
distance
jasper
kemp
lingered
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
wretched
man
would
you
care
to
have
us
carry
you
back
to
the
house
he
asked
reflectively
no
said
the
minister
bitterly
no
and
without
another
word
jasper
kemp
left
him
into
the
crept
the
minister
his
glory
all
departed
and
hid
his
misery
from
the
light
groaning
in
bitterness
of
spirit
he
who
had
made
the
hearts
of
a
score
of
old
ministers
to
sorrow
for
zion
who
had
split
in
two
a
pleasantly
united
congregation
disrupted
a
session
and
brought
about
a
scandalous
trial
in
presbytery
was
at
last
conquered
the
rev
frederick
west
had
recanted
chapter
xvii
when
margaret
left
the
with
bud
she
had
walked
but
a
few
steps
when
she
remembered
mom
wallis
and
turned
back
to
search
for
her
but
nowhere
could
she
find
a
trace
of
her
and
the
front
of
the
was
as
empty
of
any
people
from
the
camp
as
if
they
had
not
been
there
that
morning
the
curtain
had
not
yet
risen
for
the
scene
of
the
undoing
of
west
i
suppose
she
must
have
gone
home
with
them
said
the
girl
wistfully
i
sorry
not
to
have
spoken
with
her
she
was
good
to
me
you
mean
mom
wallis
said
the
boy
no
she
ai
gone
home
hiking
to
our
house
to
see
you
the
kid
went
along
of
her
see
there
down
by
those
that
them
margaret
turned
with
eagerness
and
hurried
along
with
bud
now
she
knew
who
it
was
they
called
the
kid
in
that
tone
of
voice
it
was
the
way
the
men
had
spoken
of
and
to
him
a
mingling
of
respect
and
gentling
that
showed
how
much
beloved
he
was
her
cheeks
wore
a
heightened
color
and
her
heart
gave
a
pleasant
flutter
of
interest
they
walked
rapidly
and
caught
up
with
their
guests
before
they
had
reached
the
tanner
house
and
margaret
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
mom
wallis
face
flush
with
shy
delight
when
she
caught
her
softly
round
the
waist
stealing
quietly
up
behind
and
greeted
her
with
a
kiss
there
had
not
been
many
kisses
for
mom
wallis
in
the
later
years
and
the
two
that
were
to
margaret
earle
account
seemed
very
sweet
to
her
mom
wallis
eyes
shone
as
if
she
had
been
a
young
girl
as
she
turned
with
a
smothered
oh
she
was
a
woman
not
given
to
expressing
herself
indeed
it
might
be
said
that
the
last
twenty
years
of
her
life
had
been
mainly
of
she
gave
that
one
little
gasp
of
recognition
and
pleasure
and
then
she
relapsed
into
embarrassed
silence
beside
the
two
young
people
who
found
pleasure
in
their
own
greetings
bud
was
after
a
cottontail
along
with
cap
who
had
appeared
from
no
one
knew
where
and
was
attending
the
party
joyously
mom
wallis
in
her
big
rough
shoes
on
the
heels
of
which
her
scant
brown
calico
gown
was
lifted
as
she
walked
trudged
shyly
along
between
the
two
young
people
as
carefully
watched
and
helped
over
the
humps
and
bumps
of
the
way
as
if
she
had
been
a
princess
margaret
noticed
with
a
happy
approval
how
gardley
hand
was
ready
under
the
old
woman
elbow
to
assist
her
as
politely
as
he
might
have
done
for
her
own
mother
had
she
been
walking
by
his
side
presently
bud
and
cap
returned
and
bud
with
observant
eye
soon
timed
his
step
to
margaret
on
her
other
side
and
touched
her
elbow
lightly
to
help
her
over
the
next
rut
this
was
his
second
lesson
in
manners
from
gardley
he
had
his
first
the
sunday
before
watching
the
two
while
he
and
cap
walked
behind
bud
was
learning
he
had
keen
eyes
and
an
alert
brain
margaret
smiled
understandingly
at
him
and
his
face
grew
deep
red
with
pleasure
he
was
bringin
me
to
see

nodding
toward

margaret
joyfully

your
mother

wo
she
sure
said
bud
with
that
assurance
born
of
his
life
acquaintance
with
his
mother
who
had
never
failed
him
in
a
trying
situation
so
far
as
things
to
eat
were
concerned
margaret
looked
happily
from
one
of
her
invited
guests
to
the
other
and
gardley
forgot
to
answer
for
himself
in
watching
the
brightness
of
her
face
and
wondering
why
it
was
so
different
from
the
faces
of
all
other
girls
he
knew
anywhere
but
mom
wallis
was
overwhelmed
a
wave
of
red
rolled
dully
up
from
her
withered
neck
in
its
gala
collar
over
her
leathery
face
to
the
roots
of
her
thin
gray
hair
me

could
do
that
nohow
not

room
and

the
pictures
of
my
father
and
mother
and
home
and
the
church
where
i
was
christened
and
everything
mom
wallis
looked
at
her
with
wistful
eyes
but
still
shook
her
head
oh

to
mighty
well
it

of

just

oh
ca
she
stay
this
time
mr
gardley
appealed
margaret
the
men
wo
mind
for
once
will
they
gardley
looked
into
her
true
eyes
and
saw
she
really
meant
the
invitation
he
turned
to
the
withered
old
woman
by
his
side
mom
going
to
stay
he
declared
joyously
she
wants
us
and
we
have
to
do
whatever
she
says
the
men
will
rub
along
they
all
know
how
to
cook
mom
going
to
that
beautiful
declared
margaret
it
so
nice
to
have
some
company
of
my
own
then
her
face
suddenly
sobered
wallis
mind
will
he
and
she
looked
with
troubled
eyes
from
one
of
her
guests
to
the
other
she
did
not
want
to
prepare
trouble
for
poor
mom
wallis
when
she
went
back
mom
wallis
turned
startled
eyes
toward
her
there
was
contempt
in
her
face
and
outraged
womanhood
pop
gone
off
she
said
significantly
he
went
but
he
got
no
call
t
mind
i
ben
waitin
on
pop
nigh
on
to
twenty
year
an
i
guess
i
goin
to
a
now
i
invited
pop
better
mind
i
guess
and
margaret
suddenly
saw
how
much
how
very
much
her
invitation
had
been
to
the
starved
old
soul
margaret
took
her
guests
into
the
stiff
little
parlor
and
slipped
out
to
interview
her
landlady
she
found
tanner
as
she
had
expected
a
woman
who
was
quite
pleased
to
have
more
guests
to
sit
down
to
her
generous
dinner
particularly
as
her
delightful
boarder
had
hinted
of
ample
recompense
in
the
way
of
board
money
and
she
fluttered
about
sending
tanner
after
another
jar
of
pickles
some
more
and
added
another
pie
to
the
menu
well
pleased
margaret
left
tanner
and
slipped
back
to
her
guests
she
found
gardley
making
arrangements
with
bud
to
run
back
to
the
church
and
tell
the
men
to
leave
the
buckboard
for
them
as
they
would
not
be
home
for
dinner
while
this
was
going
on
she
took
mom
wallis
up
to
her
room
to
remove
her
bonnet
and
smooth
her
hair
it
is
doubtful
whether
mom
wallis
ever
did
see
such
a
room
in
her
life
for
when
margaret
swung
open
the
door
the
poor
little
woman
stopped
short
on
the
threshold
abashed
and
caught
her
breath
looking
around
with
wondering
eyes
and
putting
out
a
trembling
hand
to
steady
herself
against
the
she
was
quite
sure
whether
things
in
that
room
were
real
or
whether
she
might
not
by
chance
have
caught
a
glimpse
into
heaven
so
beautiful
did
it
seem
to
her
it
was
not
till
her
eyes
in
the
roving
suddenly
rested
on
the
great
mountain
framed
in
the
open
window
that
she
felt
anchored
and
sure
that
this
was
a
tangible
place
then
she
ventured
to
step
her
heavy
shoe
inside
the
door
even
then
she
drew
her
ugly
calico
back
apologetically
as
if
it
were
a
desecration
to
the
lovely
room
but
margaret
seized
her
and
drew
her
into
the
room
placing
her
gently
in
the
as
if
it
were
a
throne
and
she
a
queen
and
the
poor
little
woman
sat
entranced
with
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
and
trickling
down
her
cheeks
perhaps
it
was
an
impossibility
for
margaret
to
conceive
what
the
vision
of
that
room
meant
to
mom
wallis
the
realization
of
all
the
dreams
of
a
starved
soul
concentrated
into
a
small
space
the
actual
tangible
proof
that
there
might
be
a
heaven
some
day
who
knew
since
beauties
and
comforts
like
these
could
be
real
in
arizona
margaret
brought
the
pictures
of
her
father
and
mother
of
her
dear
home
and
the
dear
old
church
she
took
her
about
the
room
and
showed
her
the
various
pictures
and
reminders
of
her
college
days
and
when
she
saw
that
the
poor
creature
was
overwhelmed
and
speechless
she
turned
her
about
and
showed
her
the
great
mountain
again
like
an
anchorage
for
her
soul
mom
wallis
looked
at
everything
speechlessly
gasping
as
her
attention
was
turned
from
one
object
to
another
as
if
she
were
unable
to
rise
beyond
her
excitement
but
when
she
saw
the
mountain
again
her
tongue
was
loosed
and
she
turned
and
looked
back
at
the
girl
wonderingly
now
ai
it
strange
even
that
old
mounting
looks
diffrunt
it
do
look
diffrunt
from
a
room
like
this
why
it
looks
like
it
got
its
hair
combed
an
its
best
collar
on
and
mom
wallis
looked
down
with
pride
and
patted
the
simple
net
ruffle
about
her
withered
throat
why
it
looks
like
a
picter
painted
an
hung
up
on
this
yere
wall
that
what
that
mounting
looks
like
it
kinda
ai
no
mounting
any
more
it
jest
a
picter
in
your
room
margaret
smiled
it
is
a
picture
is
it
just
look
at
that
silver
light
over
the
purple
place
is
it
wonderful
i
like
to
think
mine
my
mountain
and
yet
the
beautiful
thing
about
it
is
that
just
as
much
yours
too
it
will
make
a
picture
of
itself
framed
in
your
window
if
you
let
it
try
it
you
just
need
to
let
it
mom
wallis
looked
at
her
wonderingly
do
you
mean
she
said
studying
the
girl
lovely
face
that
ef
i
should
wash
them
there
winders
an
string
up
some
posy
caliker
an
stuff
a
chair
an
have
a
i
could
make
that
there
mounting
come
in
an
set
fer
me
like
a
picter
the
way
it
does
here
fer
you
yes
that
what
i
mean
said
margaret
softly
marveling
how
the
uncouth
woman
had
caught
the
thought
that
exactly
what
i
mean
gifts
will
be
as
much
to
us
as
we
will
let
them
always
try
it
and
see
mom
wallis
stood
for
some
minutes
looking
out
reflectively
at
the
mountain
wal
mebbe
i
try
it
she
said
and
turned
back
to
survey
the
room
again
and
now
the
mirror
caught
her
eye
and
she
saw
herself
a
strange
self
in
a
soft
white
collar
and
went
up
to
get
a
nearer
view
laying
a
finger
on
the
lace
and
looking
half
embarrassed
at
sight
of
her
own
face
it
a
real
purty
collar
she
said
softly
with
a
choke
in
her
voice
it
too
purty
fer
me
i
told
him
so
but
he
said
as
how
you
wanted
i
should
dress
up
every
night
fer
supper
in
it
it
as
strange
as
havin
a
mounting
come
an
live
with
you
to
wear
a
collar
like
that
me
margaret
eyes
were
suddenly
bright
with
tears
who
would
have
suspected
mom
wallis
of
having
poetry
in
her
nature
then
as
if
her
thoughts
anticipated
the
question
in
margaret
mind
mom
wallis
went
on
he
brang
me
your
little
book
she
said
i
ai
goin
to
say
thank
yeh
it
ai
a
word
an
he
read
me
the
poetry
words
it
says
i
got
it
wropped
in
a
hankercher
on
the
top
o
the
beam
over
my
bed
goin
to
have
it
buried
with
me
when
i
die
oh
i
it
i
make
much
out
of
it
but
i
read
the
words
thorough
an
then
read
the
kid
did
he
reads
just
beautiful
he
got
education
he
has
he
read
it
and
he
talked
a
lot
about
it
was
this
what
you
mean
was
it
that
we
ai
really
growin
old
at
all
we
jest
goin
on
there
if
we
go
right
did
you
mean
you
think
him
as
planned
it
all
wanted
some
old
woman
right
thar
in
the
an
it
did
you
mean
there
was
agoin
to
be
a
chanct
fer
me
to
be
young
beautiful
somewheres
in
creation
yit
i
git
through
the
old
woman
had
turned
around
from
looking
into
the
mirror
and
was
facing
her
hostess
her
eyes
were
very
bright
her
cheeks
had
taken
on
an
excited
flush
and
her
knotted
hands
were
clutching
the
bureau
she
looked
into
margaret
eyes
earnestly
as
though
her
very
life
depended
upon
the
answer
and
margaret
with
a
great
leap
of
her
heart
smiled
and
answered
yes
wallis
yes
that
is
just
what
i
meant
listen
these
are
god
own
words
about
it
i
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
with
the
glory
that
shall
be
revealed
in
us
a
kind
of
glory
shone
in
the
withered
old
face
now
did
you
say
them
was
god
words
she
asked
in
an
awed
voice
yes
said
margaret
they
are
in
the
bible
but
you
could
be
sure
it
meant
she
asked
eagerly
they
would
go
to
put
in
the
bible
o
course
oh
yes
you
could
be
quite
sure
wallis
said
margaret
gently
because
if
god
was
making
you
and
had
a
plan
for
you
as
the
poem
says
he
would
be
sure
to
put
down
something
in
his
book
about
it
do
you
think
he
would
want
you
to
know
it
does
sound
now
do
it
said
the
woman
wistfully
say
them
glory
words
again
wo
you
margaret
repeated
the
text
slowly
and
distinctly
glory
repeated
mom
wallis
wonderingly
glory
me
and
turned
incredulously
toward
the
glass
she
looked
a
long
tune
wistfully
at
herself
as
if
she
could
not
believe
it
and
pulled
reproachfully
at
the
tight
hair
drawn
away
from
her
face
i
useta
have
purty
hair
onct
she
said
sadly
why
you
have
pretty
hair
now
said
margaret
eagerly
it
just
wants
a
chance
to
show
its
beauty
here
let
me
fix
it
for
dinner
will
you
she
whisked
the
bewildered
old
woman
into
a
chair
and
began
unwinding
the
hard
tight
knot
of
hair
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
shaking
it
out
the
hair
was
thin
and
gray
now
but
it
showed
signs
of
having
been
fine
and
thick
once
it
easy
to
keep
your
hair
looking
pretty
said
the
girl
as
she
worked
i
going
to
give
you
a
little
box
of
my
nice
that
i
use
to
shampoo
my
hair
you
take
it
home
and
wash
your
hair
with
it
every
two
or
three
weeks
and
you
see
it
will
make
a
difference
in
a
little
while
you
just
have
taken
time
to
take
care
of
it
that
all
do
you
mind
if
i
wave
the
front
here
a
little
like
to
fix
your
hair
the
way
my
mother
wears
hers
now
nothing
could
have
been
further
apart
than
this
little
old
woman
and
margaret
gentle
mother
with
her
abundant
soft
gray
hair
her
cameo
features
and
her
pretty
gray
dresses
but
margaret
had
a
vision
of
what
glory
might
bring
to
mom
wallis
and
she
wanted
to
help
it
along
she
believed
that
heavenly
glory
can
be
hastened
a
good
deal
on
earth
if
one
only
tries
and
so
she
set
to
work
glancing
out
the
window
she
saw
with
relief
that
gardley
was
talking
interestedly
with
tanner
and
seemed
entirely
content
with
their
absence
mom
wallis
had
any
idea
what
waving
her
hair
meant
but
she
readily
consented
to
anything
this
wonderful
girl
proposed
and
she
sat
entranced
looking
at
her
mountain
and
thrilling
with
every
touch
of
margaret
satin
fingers
against
her
leathery
old
temples
and
so
sunday
though
it
was
margaret
lighted
her
little
and
heated
a
tiny
which
she
kept
for
emergencies
in
a
few
minutes
time
mom
wallis
astonished
old
gray
locks
lay
soft
and
fluffy
about
her
face
and
pinned
in
a
smooth
coil
behind
instead
of
the
tight
knot
making
the
most
wonderful
difference
in
the
world
in
her
old
tired
face
now
look
said
margaret
and
turned
her
about
to
the
mirror
if
there
anything
at
all
you
do
like
about
it
i
can
change
it
you
know
you
do
have
to
wear
it
so
if
you
do
like
it
the
old
woman
looked
and
then
looked
back
at
margaret
with
frightened
eyes
and
back
to
the
vision
in
the
mirror
again
my
soul
she
exclaimed
in
an
awed
voice
my
soul
it
come
glory
i
did
think
i
could
look
like
that
i
wonder
what
pop
say
my
land
would
you
mind
ef
i
kep
it
on
a
while
an
wore
it
back
to
camp
this
way
pop
might
uv
come
home
an
i
like
to
see
ef
he
take
notice
to
it
i
used
to
be
purty
onct
but
i
never
expected
no
sech
thing
like
this
again
on
earth
glory
glory
mebbe
i
get
some
glory
glory
that
shall
be
revealed
is
a
great
deal
more
wonderful
than
this
said
margaret
gently
this
was
here
all
the
time
only
you
did
let
it
come
out
wear
it
home
that
way
of
course
and
wear
it
so
all
the
time
it
very
little
trouble
and
you
find
your
family
will
like
it
men
always
like
to
see
a
woman
looking
her
best
even
when
she
working
it
helps
to
make
them
good
before
you
go
home
i
show
you
how
to
fix
it
it
quite
simple
come
now
shall
we
go
we
do
want
to
leave
gardley
alone
too
long
and
besides
i
smell
the
dinner
i
think
they
be
waiting
for
us
pretty
soon
i
going
to
take
a
few
of
these
pictures
down
to
show
mr
gardley
she
hastily
gathered
a
few
photographs
together
and
led
the
bewildered
little
woman
again
and
out
in
the
yard
where
gardley
was
walking
up
and
down
now
looking
off
at
the
mountain
it
came
to
margaret
suddenly
that
the
minister
would
be
returning
to
the
house
soon
and
she
wished
he
would
come
he
would
be
a
false
note
in
the
pleasant
harmony
of
the
little
company
he
would
be
disagreeable
to
manage
and
perhaps
hurt
poor
mom
wallis
feelings
perhaps
he
had
already
come
she
looked
furtively
around
as
she
came
out
the
door
but
no
minister
was
in
sight
and
then
she
forgot
him
utterly
in
the
look
of
bewildered
astonishment
with
which
gardley
was
regarding
mom
wallis
he
had
stopped
short
in
his
walk
across
the
little
yard
and
was
staring
at
mom
wallis
recognition
gradually
growing
in
his
gaze
when
he
was
fully
convinced
he
turned
his
eyes
to
margaret
as
if
to
ask
how
did
you
do
it
wonderful
woman
and
a
look
of
deep
reverence
for
her
came
over
his
face
then
suddenly
he
noticed
the
shy
embarrassment
on
the
old
woman
face
and
swiftly
came
toward
her
his
hands
outstretched
and
taking
her
bony
hands
in
his
bowed
low
over
them
as
a
courtier
might
do
mom
wallis
you
are
beautiful
did
you
know
it
he
said
gently
and
led
her
to
a
little
stumpy
with
a
gay
rag
cushion
that
tanner
always
kept
sitting
by
the
front
door
in
pleasant
weather
then
he
stood
off
and
surveyed
her
while
the
red
stole
into
her
cheeks
becomingly
what
has
miss
earle
been
doing
to
glorify
you
he
asked
again
looking
at
her
earnestly
the
old
woman
looked
at
him
in
awed
silence
there
was
that
word
again
glory
he
had
said
the
girl
had
glorified
her
there
was
then
some
glory
in
her
and
it
had
been
brought
out
by
so
simple
a
thing
as
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
it
frightened
her
and
tears
came
and
stood
in
her
tired
old
eyes
it
was
well
for
mom
wallis
equilibrium
that
tanner
came
out
just
then
with
the
paper
he
had
gone
after
for
the
stolidity
of
her
lifetime
was
about
breaking
up
but
as
he
turned
gardley
gave
her
one
of
the
rarest
smiles
of
sympathy
and
understanding
that
a
young
man
can
give
to
an
old
woman
and
margaret
watching
loved
him
for
it
it
seemed
to
her
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
a
young
man
had
ever
done
they
had
discussed
the
article
in
the
paper
thoroughly
and
had
looked
at
the
photographs
that
margaret
had
brought
down
and
tanner
had
come
to
the
door
numberless
times
looking
out
in
a
troubled
way
down
the
road
only
to
trot
back
again
look
in
the
oven
peep
in
the
kettle
sigh
and
trot
out
to
the
door
again
at
last
she
came
and
stood
arms
akimbo
and
looked
down
the
road
once
more
pa
i
do
just
see
how
i
can
keep
the
dinner
waitin
a
minute
longer
the
potatoes
be
i
do
see
what
keepin
that
he
musta
been
invited
out
though
i
do
see
why
he
did
send
me
word
that
it
likely
ma
said
tanner
he
was
growing
hungry
i
saw
bacon
talkin
to
him
she
likely
invited
him
there
she
always
tryin
to
get
ahead
o
you
ma
you
know
you
got
the
prize
fer
your
marble
cake
tanner
blushed
and
looked
down
apologetically
at
her
guests
well
then
ef
you
just
come
in
and
set
down
i
dish
up
my
land
that
bud
comin
down
the
road
pa
he
likely
sent
word
by
bud
hurry
in
an
dish
up
bud
slid
into
his
seat
hurriedly
after
a
brief
ablution
in
the
kitchen
and
his
mother
questioned
him
sharply
bud
wher
you
did
the
minister
get
invited
out
the
boy
grinned
and
slowly
winked
one
eye
at
gardley
yes
he
invited
out
all
right
he
said
meaningly
you
do
need
to
wait
fer
him
he
wo
be
home
fer
some
time
i
do
reckon
gardley
looked
keenly
steadily
at
the
boy
dancing
eyes
and
resolved
to
have
a
fuller
understanding
later
and
his
own
eyes
met
the
boy
in
a
gleam
of
mischief
and
sympathy
it
was
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
that
mom
wallis
had
eaten
anything
which
she
had
not
prepared
herself
and
now
with
fried
chicken
and
company
preserves
before
her
she
could
scarcely
swallow
a
mouthful
to
be
seated
beside
gardley
and
waited
on
like
a
queen
to
be
smiled
at
by
the
beautiful
young
girl
across
the
table
and
deferred
to
by
and
tanner
as
wallis
and
asked
to
have
more
pickles
and
another
helping
of
jelly
and
did
she
take
cream
and
sugar
in
her
coffee
it
was
too
much
and
mom
wallis
was
struggling
with
the
tears
even
round
blue
eyes
regarded
her
with
approval
and
interest
she
help
thinking
if
her
own
baby
boy
had
lived
would
he
ever
have
been
like
bud
and
once
she
smiled
at
him
and
bud
smiled
back
a
real
frank
hearty
grin
it
was
all
like
taking
dinner
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
mom
wallis
and
getting
glory
aforetime
it
was
a
wonderful
afternoon
and
seemed
to
go
on
swift
wings
gardley
went
back
to
the
where
the
horses
had
been
left
and
bud
went
with
him
to
give
further
particulars
about
that
wink
at
the
mom
wallis
went
up
to
the
room
and
learned
how
to
wash
her
hair
and
received
a
roll
of
flowered
scrim
wherewith
to
make
curtains
for
the
margaret
had
originally
intended
it
for
the
windows
in
case
it
proved
necessary
to
make
that
place
habitable
but
the
could
wait
and
there
in
the
with
the
new
curtains
in
her
trembling
hands
and
the
great
old
mountain
in
full
view
mom
wallis
knelt
beside
the
little
gay
while
margaret
knelt
beside
her
and
prayed
that
the
heavenly
father
would
show
mom
wallis
how
to
let
the
glory
be
revealed
in
her
now
on
the
earth
then
mom
wallis
wiped
the
furtive
tears
away
with
her
calico
sleeve
tied
on
her
funny
old
bonnet
and
rode
away
with
her
handsome
young
escort
into
the
silence
of
the
desert
with
the
glory
beginning
to
be
revealed
already
in
her
countenance
quite
late
that
evening
the
minister
returned
he
came
in
slowly
and
wearily
as
if
every
step
were
a
pain
to
him
and
he
avoided
the
light
his
coat
was
torn
and
his
garments
were
he
murmured
of
a
slight
accident
to
tanner
who
met
him
solicitously
in
a
flowered
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
he
accepted
greedily
the
half
a
pie
with
cheese
and
cold
chicken
and
other
articles
she
proffered
on
a
plate
at
his
door
and
in
the
reply
to
her
query
as
to
where
he
had
been
for
dinner
and
if
he
had
a
pleasant
time
he
said
very
pleasant
indeed
thank
you
the
name
um
ah
i
disremember
i
really
did
ask
that
is
the
minister
did
not
get
up
to
breakfast
in
fact
he
remained
in
bed
for
several
days
professing
to
be
suffering
with
an
attack
of
rheumatism
he
was
solicitously
watched
over
and
fed
by
the
anxious
tanner
who
was
much
disconcerted
at
the
state
of
affairs
and
understand
why
she
could
not
get
the
more
interested
in
the
invalid
on
the
fourth
day
however
the
reverend
frederick
crept
forth
white
and
shaken
with
his
sleek
hair
elaborately
combed
to
cover
a
long
scratch
on
his
forehead
and
announced
his
intention
of
departing
from
the
state
of
arizona
that
evening
he
crept
forth
cautiously
to
the
station
as
the
shades
of
evening
drew
on
but
found
long
bill
awaiting
him
and
jasper
kemp
not
far
away
he
had
the
two
letters
ready
in
his
pocket
with
the
gold
piece
though
he
had
entertained
hopes
of
escaping
without
forfeiting
them
but
he
was
obliged
to
wait
patiently
until
jasper
kemp
had
read
both
letters
through
twice
with
the
train
in
momentary
danger
of
departing
without
him
before
he
was
finally
allowed
to
get
on
board
jasper
parting
word
to
him
was
watch
your
steps
spry
parson
i
agoin
to
see
that
you
shadowed
wherever
you
go
you
need
think
you
can
get
shy
on
the
bible
again
it
wo
pay
there
was
menace
in
the
dry
remark
and
the
reverend
professional
egotism
withered
before
it
he
bowed
his
head
climbed
on
board
the
train
and
vanished
from
the
scene
of
his
recent
discomfiture
but
the
bitterest
thing
about
it
all
was
that
he
had
gone
without
capturing
the
heart
or
even
the
attention
of
that
haughty
little
and
she
was
such
a
pretty
girl
he
said
regretfully
to
himself
such
a
pretty
girl
he
sighed
deeply
to
himself
as
he
watched
arizona
speed
by
the
window
still
he
reflected
comfortably
after
a
moment
there
are
always
plenty
more
what
was
that
remarkably
witty
saying
i
heard
just
before
i
left
home
run
after
a
or
a
woman
there
be
another
one
along
in
a
minute
um
ah
yes
very
true
there
be
another
one
along
in
a
minute
chapter
xviii
school
had
settled
down
to
real
work
by
the
opening
of
the
new
week
margaret
knew
her
scholars
and
had
gained
a
personal
hold
on
most
of
them
already
there
was
enough
novelty
in
her
teaching
to
keep
the
entire
school
in
a
pleasant
state
of
excitement
and
wonder
as
to
what
she
would
do
next
and
the
word
had
gone
out
through
all
the
country
round
about
that
the
new
teacher
had
taken
the
school
by
storm
it
was
not
infrequent
for
men
to
turn
out
of
their
way
on
the
trail
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
school
as
they
were
passing
just
to
make
sure
the
reports
were
true
rumor
stated
that
the
teacher
was
exceedingly
pretty
that
she
would
take
no
nonsense
not
even
from
the
big
boys
that
she
never
threatened
nor
punished
but
that
every
one
of
the
boys
was
her
devoted
slave
there
had
been
no
uprising
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
that
popular
excitement
was
to
be
omitted
this
season
and
school
was
to
sail
along
in
an
orderly
and
proper
manner
in
fact
the
entire
school
as
well
as
the
surrounding
population
were
eagerly
talking
about
the
new
piano
which
seemed
really
to
be
a
coming
fact
not
that
there
had
been
anything
done
toward
it
yet
but
the
teacher
had
promised
that
just
as
soon
as
every
one
was
really
studying
hard
and
doing
his
best
she
was
going
to
begin
to
get
them
ready
for
an
entertainment
to
raise
money
for
that
piano
they
could
begin
until
everybody
was
in
good
working
order
because
they
did
want
to
take
the
interest
away
from
the
real
business
of
school
but
it
was
going
to
be
a
shakespeare
play
whatever
that
was
and
therefore
of
grave
import
some
people
talked
learnedly
about
shakespeare
and
hinted
of
poetry
but
the
main
part
of
the
community
spoke
the
name
joyously
and
familiarly
and
without
awe
as
if
it
were
milk
and
honey
in
their
mouths
why
should
they
reverence
shakespeare
more
than
any
one
else
margaret
had
grown
used
to
seeing
a
head
appear
suddenly
at
one
of
the
windows
and
look
long
and
frowningly
first
at
her
then
at
the
school
and
then
back
to
her
again
as
if
it
were
a
nine
wonder
whoever
the
visitor
was
he
would
stand
quietly
watching
the
process
of
the
hour
as
if
he
were
at
a
play
and
margaret
would
turn
and
smile
pleasantly
then
go
right
on
with
her
work
the
visitor
would
generally
take
off
a
wide
hat
and
wave
it
cordially
smile
back
a
curious
softened
smile
and
by
and
by
he
would
mount
his
horse
and
pass
on
reflectively
down
the
trail
wishing
he
could
be
a
boy
and
go
back
again
to
school
such
a
school
oh
it
was
not
all
smooth
the
way
that
margaret
walked
there
were
hitches
and
unpleasant
days
when
nothing
went
right
and
when
some
of
the
girls
got
silly
and
rebellious
and
the
boys
followed
in
their
lead
she
had
her
trials
like
any
teacher
skilful
as
she
was
and
not
the
least
of
them
became
rosa
rogers
the
petted
beauty
who
presently
manifested
a
childish
jealousy
of
her
in
her
influence
over
the
boys
noting
this
margaret
went
out
of
her
way
to
win
rosa
but
found
it
a
difficult
matter
rosa
was
proud
selfish
and
unprincipled
she
never
forgave
any
one
who
frustrated
her
plans
she
resented
being
made
to
study
like
the
rest
she
had
always
compelled
the
teacher
to
let
her
do
as
she
pleased
and
still
give
her
a
good
report
this
she
found
she
could
not
do
with
margaret
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
career
she
was
compelled
to
work
or
fall
behind
it
presently
became
not
a
question
of
how
the
new
teacher
was
to
manage
the
big
boys
and
the
bad
boys
of
the
ashland
ridge
school
but
how
she
was
to
prevent
rosa
rogers
and
a
few
girls
who
followed
her
from
upsetting
all
her
plans
the
trouble
was
rosa
was
pretty
and
knew
her
power
over
the
boys
if
she
chose
she
could
put
them
all
in
a
state
of
insubordination
and
this
she
chose
very
often
during
those
first
few
weeks
but
there
was
one
visitor
who
did
not
confine
himself
to
looking
in
at
the
window
one
morning
a
fine
black
horse
came
galloping
up
to
the
at
and
a
young
man
in
wide
sombrero
and
jaunty
leather
trappings
sprang
off
and
came
into
the
building
his
shining
spurs
caught
the
sunlight
and
flashed
as
he
moved
he
walked
with
the
air
of
one
who
regards
himself
of
far
more
importance
than
all
who
may
be
watching
him
the
boys
in
the
yard
stopped
their
and
the
girls
huddled
close
in
whispering
groups
and
drew
near
to
the
door
he
was
a
young
man
from
a
ranch
near
the
fort
some
thirty
miles
away
and
he
had
brought
an
invitation
for
the
new
to
come
over
to
dinner
on
friday
evening
and
stay
until
the
following
monday
morning
the
invitation
was
from
his
sister
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
cattleman
whose
home
and
hospitality
were
noted
for
miles
around
she
had
heard
of
the
coming
of
the
beautiful
young
teacher
and
wanted
to
attach
her
to
her
social
circle
the
young
man
was
deference
itself
to
margaret
openly
admiring
her
as
he
talked
and
said
the
most
gracious
things
to
her
and
then
while
she
was
answering
the
note
he
smiled
over
at
rosa
rogers
who
had
slipped
into
her
seat
and
was
studiously
preparing
her
algebra
with
the
book
upside
down
margaret
looking
up
caught
rosa
smiling
glance
and
the
tail
end
of
a
look
from
the
young
man
eyes
and
felt
a
passing
wonder
whether
he
had
ever
met
the
girl
before
something
in
the
boldness
of
his
look
made
her
feel
that
he
had
not
yet
he
was
all
smiles
and
deference
to
herself
and
his
open
admiration
and
pleasure
that
she
was
to
come
to
help
brighten
this
lonely
country
and
that
she
was
going
to
accept
the
invitation
was
really
pleasant
to
the
girl
for
it
was
desolate
being
tied
down
to
only
the
tanner
household
and
the
school
and
she
welcomed
any
bit
of
social
life
the
young
man
had
light
hair
combed
very
smooth
and
eyes
they
were
bolder
and
handsomer
than
the
minister
but
the
girl
had
a
feeling
that
they
were
the
very
same
cold
color
she
wondered
at
her
comparison
for
she
liked
the
handsome
young
man
and
in
spite
of
herself
was
a
little
flattered
at
the
nice
things
he
had
said
to
her
nevertheless
when
she
remembered
him
afterward
it
was
always
with
that
uncomfortable
feeling
that
if
he
had
been
so
handsome
and
polished
in
his
appearance
he
would
have
seemed
just
a
little
bit
like
that
minister
and
she
could
for
the
life
of
her
tell
why
after
he
was
gone
she
looked
back
at
rosa
and
there
was
a
narrowing
of
the
girl
eyes
and
a
frown
of
hate
on
her
brows
margaret
turned
with
a
sigh
back
to
her
school
problem
what
to
do
with
rosa
rogers
but
rosa
did
not
stay
in
the
she
slipped
out
and
walked
arm
in
arm
with
amanda
bounds
down
the
road
margaret
went
to
the
door
and
watched
presently
she
saw
the
rider
wheel
and
come
galloping
back
to
the
door
he
had
forgotten
to
tell
her
that
an
escort
would
be
sent
to
bring
her
as
early
on
friday
afternoon
as
she
would
be
ready
to
leave
the
school
and
he
intimated
that
he
hoped
he
might
be
detailed
for
that
pleasant
duty
margaret
looked
into
his
face
and
warmed
to
his
pleasant
smile
how
could
she
have
thought
him
like
west
he
touched
his
hat
and
rode
away
and
a
moment
later
she
saw
him
draw
rein
beside
rosa
and
amanda
and
presently
dismount
bud
rang
the
bell
just
then
and
margaret
went
back
to
her
desk
with
a
lingering
look
at
the
three
figures
in
the
distance
it
was
full
half
an
hour
before
rosa
came
in
with
amanda
looking
scared
behind
her
and
troubled
margaret
watched
the
sly
look
in
the
girl
eyes
and
wondered
what
she
ought
to
do
about
it
as
rosa
was
passing
out
of
the
door
after
school
she
called
her
to
the
desk
you
were
late
in
coming
in
after
recess
rosa
said
margaret
gently
have
you
any
excuse
i
was
talking
to
a
friend
said
rosa
with
a
toss
of
her
head
which
said
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
i
do
intend
to
give
an
excuse
were
you
talking
to
the
gentleman
who
was
here
well
if
i
was
what
is
that
to
you
miss
earle
said
rosa
haughtily
did
you
think
you
could
have
all
the
men
and
boys
to
yourself
rosa
said
margaret
trying
to
speak
calmly
but
her
voice
trembling
with
suppressed
indignation
do
talk
that
way
to
me
child
did
you
ever
meet
forsythe
before
i
not
a
child
and
it
none
of
your
business
flouted
rosa
angrily
and
she
twitched
away
and
flung
herself
out
of
the
margaret
trembling
from
the
disagreeable
encounter
stood
at
the
window
and
watched
the
girl
going
down
the
road
and
felt
for
the
moment
that
she
would
rather
give
up
her
school
and
go
back
home
than
face
the
situation
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
this
girl
once
an
enemy
would
be
a
bitter
one
and
this
her
last
move
had
been
a
most
unfortunate
one
coming
out
as
it
did
with
rosa
in
the
lead
she
could
of
course
complain
to
rosa
family
or
to
the
but
such
was
not
the
policy
she
had
chosen
she
wanted
to
be
able
to
settle
her
own
difficulties
it
seemed
strange
that
she
could
not
reach
this
one
girl
who
was
in
a
way
the
key
to
the
situation
perhaps
the
play
would
be
able
to
help
her
she
spent
a
long
time
that
evening
going
over
the
different
plays
in
her
library
and
finally
with
a
look
of
apology
toward
a
little
photographed
head
of
shakespeare
she
decided
on
dream
what
if
it
was
away
above
the
heads
of
them
all
would
a
few
get
something
from
it
and
was
it
better
to
take
a
great
thing
and
try
to
make
her
scholars
and
a
few
of
the
community
understand
it
rather
than
to
take
a
silly
little
play
that
would
not
amount
to
anything
in
the
end
of
course
they
could
do
it
well
that
went
without
saying
of
course
it
would
be
away
beyond
them
all
but
at
least
it
would
be
a
study
of
something
great
for
her
pupils
and
she
could
meantime
teach
them
a
little
about
shakespeare
and
perhaps
help
some
of
them
to
learn
to
love
his
plays
and
study
them
the
play
she
had
selected
was
one
in
which
she
herself
had
acted
the
part
of
puck
and
she
knew
it
by
heart
she
felt
reasonably
sure
that
she
could
help
some
of
the
more
adaptable
scholars
to
interpret
their
parts
and
at
least
it
would
be
good
for
them
just
as
a
study
in
literature
as
for
the
audience
they
would
not
be
critics
perhaps
they
would
not
even
be
able
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
play
but
they
would
come
and
they
would
listen
and
the
experiment
was
one
worth
trying
carefully
she
went
over
the
parts
trying
to
find
the
one
which
she
thought
would
best
fit
rosa
rogers
and
please
her
as
well
because
it
gave
her
opportunity
to
display
her
beauty
and
charm
she
really
was
a
pretty
girl
and
would
do
well
margaret
wondered
whether
she
were
altogether
right
in
attempting
to
win
the
girl
through
her
vanity
and
yet
what
other
weak
place
was
there
in
which
to
storm
the
silly
little
citadel
of
her
soul
and
so
the
work
of
assigning
parts
and
learning
them
began
that
very
week
though
no
one
was
allowed
a
part
until
his
work
for
the
day
had
all
been
handed
in
at
noon
margaret
made
one
more
attempt
with
rosa
rogers
she
drew
her
to
a
seat
beside
her
and
put
aside
as
much
as
possible
her
own
remembrance
of
the
girl
disagreeable
actions
and
impudent
words
rosa
she
said
and
her
voice
was
very
gentle
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
you
seem
to
feel
that
you
and
i
are
enemies
and
i
do
want
you
to
have
that
attitude
i
hoped
we
be
the
best
of
friends
you
see
there
is
any
other
way
for
us
to
work
well
together
and
i
want
to
explain
why
i
spoke
to
you
as
i
did
yesterday
it
was
not
as
you
hinted
that
i
want
to
keep
all
my
acquaintances
to
myself
i
have
no
desire
to
do
that
it
was
because
i
feel
responsible
for
the
girls
and
boys
in
my
care
and
i
was
troubled
lest
perhaps
you
had
been
foolish
margaret
paused
she
could
see
by
the
bright
hardness
of
the
girl
eyes
that
she
was
accomplishing
nothing
rosa
evidently
did
not
believe
her
well
rosa
she
said
suddenly
putting
an
impulsive
kindly
hand
on
the
girl
arm
suppose
we
forget
it
this
time
put
it
all
away
and
be
friends
let
learn
to
understand
each
other
if
we
can
but
in
the
mean
time
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
play
and
then
indeed
rosa
hard
manner
broke
and
she
looked
up
with
interest
albeit
there
was
some
suspicion
in
the
glance
she
wanted
to
be
in
that
play
with
all
her
heart
she
wanted
the
very
showiest
part
in
it
too
and
she
meant
to
have
it
although
she
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
the
teacher
would
want
to
keep
that
part
for
herself
whatever
it
was
but
margaret
had
been
wise
she
had
decided
to
take
time
and
explain
the
play
to
her
and
then
let
her
choose
her
own
part
she
wisely
judged
that
rosa
would
do
better
in
the
part
in
which
her
interest
centered
and
perhaps
the
choice
would
help
her
to
understand
her
pupil
better
and
so
for
an
hour
she
patiently
stayed
after
school
and
went
over
the
play
explaining
it
carefully
and
it
seemed
at
one
time
as
though
rosa
was
about
to
choose
to
be
puck
because
with
quick
perception
she
caught
the
importance
of
that
character
but
when
she
learned
that
the
costume
must
be
a
quiet
hood
and
skirt
of
green
and
brown
she
scorned
it
and
chose
at
last
to
be
titania
queen
of
the
fairies
so
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
a
keen
insight
into
the
shallow
nature
margaret
began
to
teach
the
girl
some
of
the
fairy
steps
and
found
her
quick
and
eager
to
learn
in
the
first
lesson
rosa
forgot
for
a
little
while
her
animosity
and
became
almost
as
one
of
the
other
pupils
the
play
was
going
to
prove
a
great
means
of
bringing
them
all
together
before
friday
afternoon
came
the
parts
had
all
been
assigned
and
the
plans
for
the
entertainment
were
well
under
way
jed
and
timothy
had
been
as
good
as
their
word
about
giving
the
teacher
each
vying
with
the
other
to
bring
a
horse
and
make
her
ride
at
noon
hour
and
she
had
already
had
several
good
lessons
and
a
long
ride
or
two
in
company
with
both
her
teachers
the
ride
for
friday
then
was
not
such
an
undertaking
as
it
might
otherwise
have
been
and
margaret
looked
forward
to
it
with
eagerness
chapter
xix
the
little
party
of
escort
arrived
before
school
was
closed
on
friday
afternoon
and
came
down
to
the
in
full
force
to
take
her
away
with
them
the
young
man
forsythe
with
his
sister
the
hostess
herself
and
a
young
army
officer
from
the
fort
comprised
the
party
margaret
dismissed
school
ten
minutes
early
and
went
back
with
them
to
the
tanners
to
make
a
hurried
change
in
her
dress
and
pick
up
her
which
was
already
packed
as
they
rode
away
from
the
margaret
looked
back
and
saw
rosa
rogers
posing
in
one
of
her
sprite
dances
in
the
saw
her
kiss
her
hand
laughingly
toward
their
party
and
saw
the
flutter
of
a
handkerchief
in
young
forsythe
hand
it
was
all
very
general
and
elusive
a
passing
bit
of
fun
but
it
left
an
uncomfortable
impression
on
the
teacher
mind
she
looked
keenly
at
the
young
man
as
he
rode
up
smiling
beside
her
and
once
more
experienced
that
strange
sudden
change
of
feeling
about
him
she
took
opportunity
during
that
long
ride
to
find
out
if
the
young
man
had
known
rosa
rogers
before
but
he
frankly
told
her
that
he
had
just
come
west
to
visit
his
sister
was
bored
to
death
because
he
did
know
a
soul
in
the
whole
state
and
until
he
had
seen
her
had
not
laid
eyes
on
one
whom
he
cared
to
know
yet
while
she
could
not
help
enjoying
the
gay
badinage
she
carried
a
sense
of
uneasiness
whenever
she
thought
of
the
young
girl
rosa
in
her
pretty
fairy
pose
with
her
fluttering
pink
fingers
and
her
saucy
smiling
eyes
there
was
something
untrustworthy
too
in
the
handsome
face
of
the
man
beside
her
there
was
just
one
shadow
over
this
bit
of
a
holiday
margaret
had
a
little
feeling
that
possibly
some
one
from
the
camp
might
come
down
on
saturday
or
sunday
and
she
would
miss
him
yet
nothing
had
been
said
about
it
and
she
had
no
way
of
sending
word
that
she
would
be
away
she
had
meant
to
send
mom
wallis
a
letter
by
the
next
messenger
that
came
that
way
it
was
all
written
and
lying
on
her
bureau
but
no
one
had
been
down
all
the
week
she
was
therefore
greatly
pleased
when
an
approaching
rider
in
the
distance
proved
to
be
gardley
and
with
a
joyful
little
greeting
she
drew
rein
and
hailed
him
giving
him
a
message
for
mom
wallis
only
gardley
eyes
told
what
this
meeting
was
to
him
his
demeanor
was
grave
and
dignified
he
acknowledged
the
introductions
to
the
rest
of
the
party
gracefully
touched
his
hat
with
the
ease
of
one
to
the
manner
born
and
rode
away
flashing
her
one
gleam
of
a
smile
that
told
her
he
was
glad
of
the
meeting
but
throughout
the
brief
interview
there
had
been
an
air
of
question
and
hostility
between
the
two
men
forsythe
and
gardley
forsythe
surveyed
gardley
rudely
almost
insolently
as
if
his
position
beside
the
lady
gave
him
rights
beyond
the
other
and
he
resented
the
coming
of
the
stranger
gardley
gaze
was
cold
too
as
he
met
the
look
and
his
eyes
searched
forsythe
face
keenly
as
though
they
would
find
out
what
manner
of
man
was
riding
with
his
friend
when
he
was
gone
margaret
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
somehow
disappointed
and
once
she
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
wistfully
after
him
but
he
was
riding
furiously
into
the
distance
sitting
his
horse
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
already
far
away
upon
the
desert
your
friend
is
a
reckless
rider
said
forsythe
with
a
sneer
in
his
voice
that
margaret
did
not
like
as
they
watched
the
speck
in
the
distance
clear
a
steep
descent
from
the
mesa
at
a
bound
and
disappear
from
sight
in
the
mesquite
beyond
is
he
where
did
you
find
him
miss
earle
asked
temple
eagerly
i
wish
i
asked
him
to
join
us
he
left
so
suddenly
i
did
realize
he
was
going
margaret
felt
a
wondering
and
pleasant
sense
of
possession
and
pride
in
gardley
as
she
watched
but
she
quietly
explained
that
the
young
stranger
was
from
the
east
and
that
he
was
engaged
in
some
kind
of
cattle
business
at
a
distance
from
ashland
her
manner
was
reserved
and
the
matter
dropped
she
naturally
felt
a
reluctance
to
tell
how
her
acquaintance
with
gardley
began
it
seemed
something
between
themselves
she
could
fancy
the
gushing
temple
saying
how
romantic
she
was
that
kind
of
a
woman
it
was
evident
that
she
was
romantically
inclined
herself
for
she
used
her
fine
eyes
with
effect
on
the
young
officer
who
rode
with
her
and
margaret
found
herself
wondering
what
kind
of
a
husband
she
had
and
what
her
mother
would
think
of
a
woman
like
this
there
was
no
denying
that
the
luxury
of
the
ranch
was
a
happy
relief
from
the
simplicity
of
life
at
the
tanners
iced
drinks
and
cushions
and
feasting
and
music
and
laughter
there
were
books
too
and
magazines
and
all
the
little
things
that
go
to
make
up
a
cultured
life
and
yet
they
were
not
people
of
margaret
world
and
when
saturday
evening
was
over
she
sat
alone
in
the
room
they
had
given
her
and
facing
herself
in
the
glass
confessed
to
herself
that
she
looked
back
with
more
pleasure
to
the
sabbath
spent
with
mom
wallis
than
she
could
look
forward
to
a
sabbath
here
the
morning
proved
her
forebodings
well
founded
breakfast
was
a
late
informal
affair
filled
with
hilarious
gaiety
there
was
no
mention
of
any
church
service
and
margaret
found
it
was
quite
too
late
to
suggest
such
a
thing
when
breakfast
was
over
even
if
she
had
been
sure
there
was
any
service
after
breakfast
was
over
there
were
various
forms
of
amusement
proposed
for
her
pleasure
and
she
really
felt
very
much
embarrassed
for
a
few
moments
to
know
how
to
avoid
what
to
her
was
pure
yet
she
did
not
wish
to
be
rude
to
these
people
who
were
really
trying
to
be
kind
to
her
she
managed
at
last
to
get
them
interested
in
music
and
grouping
them
around
the
piano
after
a
few
preliminary
performances
by
herself
at
their
earnest
solicitation
coaxed
them
into
singing
hymns
after
all
they
really
seemed
to
enjoy
it
though
they
had
to
get
along
with
one
for
the
whole
company
but
margaret
knew
how
to
make
interesting
and
her
exquisite
voice
was
never
more
at
its
best
than
when
she
led
off
with
my
jesus
as
thou
wilt
or
jesus
saviour
pilot
me
you
would
be
the
delight
of
brownleigh
heart
said
the
hostess
gushingly
at
last
after
margaret
had
finished
singing
abide
with
me
with
wonderful
feeling
and
who
is
mr
brownleigh
asked
margaret
why
should
i
delight
his
heart
why
he
is
our
missionary
that
is
the
missionary
for
this
region
and
you
would
delight
his
heart
because
you
are
so
religious
and
sing
so
well
said
the
superficial
little
woman
brownleigh
is
really
a
very
cultured
man
of
course
he
narrow
all
clergymen
are
narrow
do
you
think
they
have
to
be
to
a
certain
extent
he
really
narrow
why
he
believes
in
the
bible
the
whale
and
jonah
and
the
flood
and
making
bread
out
of
stones
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
imagine
it
but
he
does
he
sincere
perfectly
sincere
i
suppose
he
has
to
be
it
his
business
but
sometimes
one
feels
it
a
pity
that
he
ca
relax
a
little
just
among
us
here
you
know
we
never
tell
why
he
wo
even
play
a
little
game
of
poker
and
he
does
smoke
it
even
when
he
by
and
one
would
is
that
odd
but
he
can
preach
he
really
very
interesting
only
a
little
too
utopian
in
his
ideas
he
thinks
everybody
ought
to
be
good
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
really
thinks
it
possible
and
he
lives
that
way
himself
he
really
does
but
he
is
a
wonderful
person
only
i
feel
sorry
for
his
wife
sometimes
she
quite
a
cultured
person
has
been
wealthy
you
know
she
was
a
new
york
society
girl
just
imagine
it
out
in
these
wilds
taking
gruel
to
the
dirty
little
indians
how
she
ever
came
to
do
it
of
course
she
adores
him
but
i
ca
really
believe
she
is
happy
no
woman
could
be
quite
blind
enough
to
give
up
everything
in
the
world
for
one
man
no
matter
how
good
he
was
do
you
think
she
could
it
was
as
if
she
did
have
plenty
of
other
chances
she
gave
them
all
up
to
come
out
and
marry
him
she
a
pretty
good
sport
too
she
never
lets
you
know
she
is
perfectly
happy
she
happy
mother
she
happier
than
i
ever
saw
declared
the
daughter
of
the
house
who
was
home
from
for
a
brief
visit
during
an
epidemic
of
measles
in
the
school
oh
yes
she
manages
to
make
people
think
she
happy
said
her
mother
indulgently
but
you
ca
make
me
believe
she
satisfied
to
give
up
her
house
on
fifth
avenue
and
live
in
a
log
cabin
in
the
desert
with
no
society
mother
you
do
know
why
woman
would
be
satisfied
if
her
husband
adored
her
the
way
brownleigh
does
her
well
ada
you
a
romantic
girl
and
brownleigh
is
a
handsome
man
you
got
a
few
things
to
learn
yet
mark
my
words
i
believe
you
see
brownleigh
coming
back
next
month
with
her
husband
this
operation
was
all
well
enough
to
talk
about
but
i
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
he
has
come
back
alone
or
else
that
he
has
accepted
a
call
to
some
big
city
church
and
he
equal
to
the
city
church
too
that
the
wonder
of
it
he
comes
of
a
fine
family
himself
i
heard
oh
people
ca
keep
up
the
pose
of
saints
forever
even
though
they
do
adore
each
other
but
brownleigh
a
good
man
the
vapid
little
woman
sat
looking
reflectively
out
of
the
window
for
a
whole
minute
after
this
deliverance
yes
certainly
brownleigh
was
a
good
man
he
was
the
one
man
of
culture
education
refinement
who
had
come
her
way
in
many
a
year
who
had
patiently
and
persistently
and
gloriously
refused
her
advances
at
a
mild
flirtation
and
refused
to
understand
them
yet
remained
her
friend
and
reverenced
hero
he
was
a
good
man
and
she
knew
it
for
she
was
a
very
pretty
woman
and
understood
her
art
well
before
the
day
was
over
margaret
had
reason
to
feel
that
a
sabbath
in
arizona
was
a
very
hard
thing
to
find
the
singing
could
not
last
all
day
and
her
friends
seemed
to
find
more
amusements
on
sunday
that
did
not
come
into
margaret
code
of
than
one
knew
how
to
say
no
to
neither
could
they
understand
her
feeling
and
she
found
it
hard
not
to
be
rude
in
gently
declining
one
plan
after
another
she
drew
the
children
into
a
wide
cozy
corner
after
dinner
and
began
a
bible
story
in
the
guise
of
a
while
the
hostess
slipped
away
to
take
a
nap
however
several
other
guests
lingered
about
and
temple
strayed
in
they
sat
with
newspapers
before
their
faces
and
got
into
the
story
too
seeming
to
be
deeply
interested
so
that
after
all
margaret
did
not
have
an
unprofitable
sabbath
but
altogether
though
she
had
a
gay
and
somewhat
frivolous
time
a
good
deal
of
admiration
and
many
invitations
to
return
as
often
as
possible
margaret
was
not
sorry
when
she
said
good
night
to
know
that
she
was
to
return
in
the
early
morning
to
her
work
temple
himself
was
going
part
way
with
them
accompanied
by
his
niece
forsythe
and
the
young
officer
who
came
over
with
them
margaret
rode
beside
temple
until
his
way
parted
from
theirs
and
had
a
delightful
talk
about
arizona
he
was
a
kindly
old
fellow
who
adored
his
frivolous
little
wife
and
let
her
go
her
own
gait
seeming
not
to
mind
how
much
she
flirted
the
morning
was
pink
and
silver
gold
and
azure
a
wonderful
specimen
of
an
arizona
sunrise
for
margaret
benefit
and
a
glorious
beginning
for
her
day
work
in
spite
of
the
extremely
early
hour
the
company
was
gay
and
blithe
and
the
eastern
girl
felt
as
if
she
were
passing
through
a
wonderful
experience
they
loitered
a
little
on
the
way
to
show
margaret
the
wonders
of
a
cañon
and
it
was
almost
when
they
came
up
the
street
so
that
margaret
rode
straight
to
the
instead
of
stopping
at
tanners
on
the
way
to
the
school
they
passed
a
group
of
girls
of
whom
rosa
rogers
was
the
center
a
certain
something
in
narrowed
eyelids
as
she
said
good
morning
caused
margaret
to
look
back
uneasily
and
she
distinctly
saw
the
girl
give
a
signal
to
young
forsythe
who
for
answer
only
tipped
his
hat
and
gave
her
a
peculiar
smile
in
a
moment
more
they
had
said
and
margaret
was
left
at
the
door
with
a
cluster
of
eager
children
about
her
and
several
shy
boys
in
the
background
ready
to
welcome
her
back
as
if
she
had
been
gone
a
month
in
the
flutter
of
opening
school
margaret
failed
to
notice
that
rosa
rogers
did
not
appear
it
was
not
until
the
roll
was
called
that
she
noticed
her
absence
and
she
looked
uneasily
toward
the
door
many
times
during
the
morning
but
rosa
did
not
come
until
after
recess
when
she
stole
smilingly
in
as
if
it
were
quite
the
thing
to
come
to
school
late
when
questioned
about
her
tardiness
she
said
she
had
torn
her
dress
and
had
to
go
home
and
change
it
margaret
knew
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
that
the
girl
was
not
telling
the
truth
but
what
was
she
to
do
it
troubled
her
all
the
morning
and
went
with
her
to
a
sleepless
pillow
that
night
she
was
beginning
to
see
that
life
as
a
in
the
far
west
was
not
all
she
had
imagined
it
to
be
her
father
had
been
right
there
would
likely
be
more
thorns
than
roses
on
her
way
chapter
xx
the
first
time
lance
gardley
met
rosa
rogers
riding
with
archie
forsythe
he
thought
little
of
it
he
knew
the
girl
by
sight
because
he
knew
her
father
in
a
business
way
that
she
was
very
young
and
one
of
margaret
pupils
was
all
he
knew
about
her
for
the
young
man
he
had
conceived
a
strong
dislike
but
as
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
it
he
put
it
out
of
his
mind
as
quickly
as
possible
the
second
time
he
met
them
it
was
toward
evening
and
they
were
so
wholly
absorbed
in
each
other
society
that
they
did
not
see
him
until
he
was
close
upon
them
forsythe
looked
up
with
a
frown
and
a
quick
hand
to
his
hip
where
gleamed
a
weapon
he
scarcely
returned
the
slight
salute
given
by
gardley
and
the
two
young
people
touched
up
their
horses
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
in
the
mesquite
but
something
in
the
frightened
look
of
the
girl
eyes
caused
gardley
to
turn
and
look
after
the
two
where
could
they
be
going
at
that
hour
of
the
evening
it
was
not
a
trail
usually
chosen
for
rides
it
was
lonely
and
unfrequented
and
led
out
of
the
way
of
travelers
gardley
himself
had
been
a
far
errand
for
jasper
kemp
and
had
taken
this
short
trail
back
because
it
cut
off
several
miles
and
he
was
weary
also
he
was
anxious
to
stop
in
ashland
and
leave
mom
wallis
request
that
margaret
would
spend
the
next
sabbath
at
the
camp
and
see
the
new
curtains
he
was
thinking
what
he
should
say
to
her
when
he
saw
her
in
a
little
while
now
and
this
interruption
to
his
thoughts
was
unwelcome
nevertheless
he
could
not
get
away
from
that
frightened
look
in
the
girl
eyes
where
could
they
have
been
going
that
fellow
was
a
in
the
region
perhaps
he
had
lost
his
way
perhaps
he
did
not
know
that
the
road
he
was
taking
the
girl
led
into
a
region
of
outlaws
and
that
the
only
habitation
along
the
way
was
a
cabin
belonging
to
an
old
woman
of
weird
reputation
where
wild
orgies
were
sometimes
celebrated
and
where
men
went
who
loved
darkness
rather
than
light
because
their
deeds
were
evil
twice
gardley
turned
in
his
saddle
and
scanned
the
desert
the
sky
was
darkening
and
one
or
two
pale
stars
were
impatiently
shadowing
forth
their
presence
and
now
he
could
see
the
two
riders
again
they
had
come
up
out
of
the
mesquite
to
the
top
of
the
mesa
and
were
outlined
against
the
sky
sharply
they
were
still
on
the
trail
to
old
ouida
cabin
with
a
quick
jerk
gardley
reined
in
his
horse
and
wheeled
about
watching
the
riders
for
a
moment
and
then
setting
spurs
to
his
beast
he
was
off
down
the
trail
after
them
on
one
of
his
wild
reckless
rides
down
through
the
mesquite
he
plunged
through
the
darkening
grove
out
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
mesa
he
had
lost
sight
of
his
quarry
for
the
time
but
now
he
could
see
them
again
riding
more
slowly
in
the
valley
below
their
horses
close
together
and
even
as
he
watched
the
sky
took
on
its
wide
night
look
and
the
stars
blazed
forth
suddenly
gardley
turned
sharply
from
the
trail
and
made
a
detour
through
a
grove
of
trees
riding
with
reckless
speed
his
head
down
to
escape
low
branches
and
in
a
minute
or
two
he
came
with
unerring
instinct
back
to
the
trail
some
distance
ahead
of
forsythe
and
rosa
then
he
wheeled
his
horse
and
stopped
awaiting
their
coming
by
this
time
the
great
full
moon
was
risen
and
strangely
enough
was
at
gardley
back
making
a
silhouette
of
man
and
horse
as
the
two
riders
came
on
toward
him
they
rode
out
from
the
cover
of
the
grove
and
there
he
was
across
their
path
rosa
gave
a
scream
drawing
nearer
her
companion
and
her
horse
swerved
and
reared
but
gardley
black
stood
like
an
image
carved
in
ebony
against
the
silver
of
the
moon
and
gardley
quiet
voice
was
in
strong
contrast
to
the
quick
unguarded
exclamation
of
forsythe
as
he
sharply
drew
rein
and
put
his
hand
hastily
to
his
hip
for
his
weapon
i
beg
your
pardon
forsythe
gardley
had
an
excellent
memory
for
names
but
i
thought
you
might
not
be
aware
being
a
in
these
parts
that
the
trail
you
are
taking
leads
to
a
place
where
ladies
do
not
like
to
go
really
you
do
say
so
answered
the
young
man
insolently
it
is
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
but
you
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
i
know
perfectly
where
i
am
going
and
so
does
the
lady
and
we
choose
to
go
this
way
move
out
of
the
way
please
you
are
detaining
us
but
gardley
did
not
move
out
of
the
way
i
am
sure
the
lady
does
not
know
where
she
is
going
he
said
firmly
i
am
sure
that
she
does
not
know
that
it
is
a
place
of
bad
reputation
even
in
this
unconventional
land
at
least
if
she
knows
i
am
sure
that
does
not
know
and
i
am
well
acquainted
with
her
father
get
out
of
the
way
sir
said
forsythe
hotly
it
certainly
is
none
of
your
business
anyway
whoever
knows
what
get
out
of
the
way
or
i
shall
shoot
this
lady
and
i
intend
to
ride
where
we
please
then
i
shall
have
to
say
you
said
gardley
and
his
voice
still
had
that
calm
that
made
his
opponent
think
him
easy
to
conquer
just
how
do
you
propose
to
stop
us
sneered
forsythe
pulling
out
his
pistol
this
way
said
gardley
lifting
a
tiny
silver
whistle
to
his
lips
and
sending
forth
a
peculiar
shrilling
blast
and
this
way
went
on
gardley
calmly
lifting
both
hands
and
showing
a
weapon
in
each
wherewith
he
covered
the
two
rosa
screamed
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
cowering
in
her
saddle
forsythe
lifted
his
weapon
but
looked
around
nervously
dead
men
tell
no
tales
he
said
angrily
it
depends
upon
the
man
said
gardley
meaningly
especially
if
he
were
found
on
this
road
i
fancy
a
few
tales
could
be
told
if
you
happened
to
be
the
man
turn
your
horses
around
at
once
and
take
this
lady
back
to
her
home
my
men
are
not
far
off
and
if
you
do
not
wish
the
whole
story
to
be
known
among
your
friends
and
hers
you
would
better
make
haste
forsythe
dropped
his
weapon
and
obeyed
he
decidedly
did
not
wish
his
escapade
to
be
known
among
his
friends
there
were
financial
reasons
why
he
did
not
care
to
have
it
come
to
the
ears
of
his
just
now
silently
in
the
moonlight
the
little
procession
took
its
way
down
the
trail
the
girl
and
the
man
side
by
side
their
captor
close
behind
and
when
the
girl
summoned
courage
to
glance
fearsomely
behind
her
she
saw
three
more
men
riding
like
three
grim
shadows
yet
behind
they
had
fallen
into
the
trail
so
quietly
that
she
had
not
heard
them
when
they
came
they
were
jasper
kemp
long
bill
and
big
jim
they
had
been
out
for
other
purposes
but
without
question
followed
the
call
of
the
signal
it
was
a
long
ride
back
to
rogers
ranch
and
forsythe
glanced
nervously
behind
now
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
company
was
growing
larger
all
the
time
he
half
expected
to
see
a
regiment
each
time
he
turned
he
tried
hurrying
his
horse
but
when
he
did
so
the
followers
were
just
as
close
without
any
seeming
effort
he
tried
to
laugh
it
all
off
once
he
turned
and
tried
to
placate
gardley
with
a
few
shakily
jovial
words
look
here
old
fellow
are
you
the
man
i
met
on
the
trail
the
day
miss
earle
went
over
to
the
fort
i
guess
you
made
a
mistake
in
your
calculations
i
was
merely
out
on
a
pleasure
ride
with
miss
rogers
we
were
going
anywhere
in
particular
you
know
miss
rogers
chose
this
way
and
i
wanted
to
please
her
no
man
likes
to
have
his
pleasure
interfered
with
you
know
i
guess
you
did
recognize
me
i
recognized
you
said
gardley
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
be
careful
where
you
ride
with
ladies
especially
at
night
the
matter
however
is
one
that
you
would
better
settle
with
rogers
my
duty
will
be
done
when
i
have
put
it
into
his
hands
now
my
good
fellow
said
forsythe
patronizingly
you
surely
intend
to
make
a
great
fuss
about
this
and
go
telling
tales
to
rogers
about
a
trifling
matter
i
intend
to
do
my
duty
forsythe
said
gardley
and
forsythe
noticed
that
the
young
man
still
held
his
weapons
i
was
set
this
night
to
guard
rogers
property
that
i
did
not
expect
his
daughter
would
be
a
part
of
the
evening
guarding
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
i
shall
certainly
put
the
matter
into
rogers
hands
rosa
began
to
cry
softly
well
if
you
want
to
be
a
fool
of
course
laughed
forsythe
disagreeably
but
you
will
soon
see
rogers
will
accept
my
explanation
that
is
for
rogers
to
decide
answered
gardley
and
said
no
more
the
reflections
of
forsythe
during
the
rest
of
that
silent
ride
were
not
pleasant
and
rosa
intermittent
crying
did
not
tend
to
make
him
more
comfortable
the
silent
procession
at
last
turned
in
at
the
great
ranch
gate
and
rode
up
to
the
house
just
as
they
stopped
and
the
door
of
the
house
swung
open
letting
out
a
flood
of
light
rosa
leaned
toward
gardley
and
whispered
please
gardley
do
tell
papa
i
do
in
the
world
for
you
if
you
wo
tell
papa
he
looked
at
the
pretty
pitiful
child
in
the
moonlight
i
sorry
miss
rosa
he
said
firmly
but
you
do
understand
i
must
do
my
duty
then
i
shall
hate
you
she
hissed
do
you
hear
i
shall
you
forever
and
you
do
know
what
that
means
it
means
i
take
my
on
you
and
on
you
he
looked
at
her
half
pityingly
as
he
swung
off
his
horse
and
went
up
the
steps
to
meet
rogers
who
had
come
out
and
was
standing
on
the
top
step
of
the
in
the
square
of
light
that
flickered
from
a
great
fire
on
the
hearth
of
the
wide
fireplace
he
was
looking
from
one
to
another
of
the
silent
group
and
as
his
eyes
rested
on
his
daughter
he
said
sternly
why
rosa
what
does
this
mean
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
bed
with
a
headache
gardley
drew
his
employer
aside
and
told
what
had
happened
in
a
few
sentences
and
then
stepped
down
and
back
into
the
shadow
his
horse
by
his
side
the
three
men
from
the
camp
grouped
behind
him
he
had
the
delicacy
to
withdraw
after
his
duty
was
done
rogers
his
face
stern
with
sudden
anger
and
alarm
stepped
down
and
stood
beside
his
daughter
rosa
you
may
get
down
and
go
into
the
house
to
your
own
room
i
will
talk
with
you
later
he
said
and
then
to
the
young
man
you
sir
will
step
into
my
office
i
wish
to
have
a
plain
talk
with
you
a
later
forsythe
came
out
of
the
rogers
house
and
mounted
his
horse
while
rogers
stood
silently
and
watched
him
i
will
bid
you
good
evening
sir
he
said
formally
as
the
young
man
mounted
his
horse
and
silently
rode
away
his
back
had
a
defiant
look
in
the
moonlight
as
he
passed
the
group
of
men
in
the
shadow
but
they
did
not
turn
to
watch
him
that
will
be
all
gardley
and
i
thank
you
very
much
called
the
clear
voice
of
rogers
from
his
front
steps
the
four
men
mounted
their
horses
silently
and
rode
down
a
little
distance
behind
the
young
man
who
wondered
in
his
heart
just
how
much
or
how
little
gardley
had
told
rosa
father
the
interview
to
which
young
forsythe
had
just
been
subjected
had
been
chastening
in
character
of
a
kind
to
baffle
curiosity
concerning
the
father
knowledge
of
details
and
to
discourage
any
further
romantic
rides
with
miss
rosa
it
had
been
left
in
abeyance
whether
or
not
the
temples
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
episode
dependent
upon
the
future
conduct
of
both
young
people
it
had
not
been
satisfactory
from
forsythe
point
of
view
that
is
he
had
not
been
so
easily
able
to
disabuse
the
father
mind
of
suspicion
nor
to
establish
his
own
guileless
character
as
he
had
hoped
and
some
of
the
remarks
rogers
made
led
forsythe
to
think
that
the
father
understood
just
how
unpleasant
it
might
become
for
him
if
his
found
out
about
the
escapade
this
is
why
archie
forsythe
feared
lance
gardley
although
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
triumphant
about
the
set
of
that
young
shoulders
as
he
rode
away
in
the
moonlight
on
the
trail
toward
ashland
and
this
is
how
it
came
about
that
rosa
rogers
hated
lance
gardley
handsome
and
daring
though
he
was
and
because
of
him
hated
her
teacher
margaret
earle
an
hour
later
lance
gardley
stood
in
the
little
dim
tanner
parlor
talking
to
margaret
you
look
tired
said
the
girl
compassionately
as
she
saw
the
haggard
shadows
on
the
young
face
showing
in
spite
of
the
light
of
pleasure
in
his
eyes
you
look
tired
what
in
the
world
have
you
been
doing
i
went
out
to
catch
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
i
found
there
were
other
kinds
of
thieves
abroad
it
all
in
the
day
work
i
not
tired
now
and
he
smiled
at
her
with
beautiful
reverence
margaret
as
she
watched
him
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
lines
in
his
face
had
softened
and
strengthened
since
she
had
first
seen
him
and
her
eyes
let
him
know
that
she
was
glad
he
had
come
and
so
you
will
really
come
to
us
and
it
is
going
to
be
asking
too
much
he
said
wistfully
you
ca
think
what
it
going
to
be
to
the
men
to
and
mom
wallis
is
so
excited
she
can
hardly
get
her
work
done
if
you
had
said
no
i
would
be
almost
afraid
to
go
back
he
laughed
but
she
could
see
there
was
deep
earnestness
under
his
tone
indeed
i
will
come
said
margaret
i
just
looking
forward
to
it
i
going
to
bring
mom
wallis
a
new
bonnet
like
one
i
made
for
mother
and
i
going
to
teach
her
how
to
make
corn
gems
and
steamed
apple
dumplings
i
bringing
some
songs
and
some
music
for
the
violin
and
i
got
something
for
you
to
help
me
do
too
if
you
will
he
smiled
tenderly
down
on
her
what
a
wonderful
girl
she
was
to
be
willing
to
come
out
to
the
old
shack
among
a
lot
of
rough
men
and
one
uncultured
old
woman
and
make
them
happy
when
she
was
fit
for
the
finest
in
the
land
you
he
said
taking
her
hand
with
a
quick
pressure
for
you
make
every
one
want
to
do
his
best
he
hurried
out
to
his
horse
and
rode
away
in
the
moonlight
margaret
went
up
to
her
mountain
window
and
watched
him
far
out
on
the
trail
her
heart
swelling
with
an
unnamed
gladness
over
his
last
words
oh
god
keep
him
and
help
him
to
make
good
she
prayed
chapter
xxi
the
visit
to
the
camp
was
a
time
to
be
remembered
long
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
and
even
by
margaret
herself
margaret
wondered
friday
evening
as
she
sat
up
late
working
away
braiding
a
lovely
gray
bonnet
out
of
folds
of
malines
and
fashioning
it
into
form
for
mom
wallis
why
she
was
looking
forward
to
the
visit
with
so
much
more
real
pleasure
than
she
had
done
to
the
one
the
week
before
at
the
temples
and
so
subtle
is
the
heart
of
a
maid
that
she
never
fathomed
the
real
reason
the
temples
of
course
was
interesting
and
delightful
as
being
something
utterly
new
in
her
experience
it
was
comparatively
luxurious
and
there
were
pleasant
cultured
people
there
more
from
her
own
social
class
in
life
but
it
was
going
to
be
such
fun
to
surprise
mom
wallis
with
that
bonnet
and
see
her
old
face
light
up
when
she
saw
herself
in
the
little
folding
mirror
she
was
taking
along
with
her
and
meant
to
leave
for
mom
wallis
log
boudoir
she
was
quite
excited
over
selecting
some
little
thing
for
each
one
of
the
men
books
pictures
a
piece
of
music
a
bright
cushion
and
a
pile
of
picture
magazines
it
made
a
big
bundle
when
she
had
them
together
and
she
was
dubious
if
she
ought
to
try
to
carry
them
all
but
bud
whom
she
consulted
on
the
subject
said
loftily
it
was
a
for
the
kid
he
could
carry
anything
on
a
horse
bud
was
just
a
little
jealous
to
have
his
beloved
teacher
away
from
home
so
much
and
rejoiced
greatly
when
gardley
friday
afternoon
suggested
that
he
come
along
too
he
made
quick
time
to
his
home
and
secured
a
hasty
permission
and
wardrobe
appearing
like
a
footman
on
his
old
horse
when
they
were
half
a
mile
down
the
trail
mom
wallis
was
out
at
the
door
to
greet
her
guest
when
she
arrived
for
margaret
had
chosen
to
make
her
visit
last
from
friday
afternoon
after
school
until
monday
morning
it
was
the
generosity
of
her
nature
that
she
gave
to
her
utmost
when
she
gave
the
one
fear
she
had
entertained
about
coming
had
been
set
at
rest
on
the
way
when
gardley
told
her
that
pop
wallis
was
off
on
one
of
his
long
trips
selling
cattle
and
would
probably
not
return
for
a
week
margaret
much
as
she
trusted
gardley
and
the
men
could
not
help
dreading
to
meet
pop
wallis
again
there
was
a
new
trimness
about
the
old
the
clearing
had
been
cleaned
up
and
made
neat
the
grass
cut
some
vines
set
out
and
trained
up
limply
about
the
door
and
the
windows
shone
with
mom
washing
mom
wallis
herself
was
wearing
her
best
white
apron
stiff
with
starch
her
lace
collar
and
her
hair
in
her
best
imitation
of
the
way
margaret
had
fixed
it
although
it
must
be
confessed
she
had
quite
caught
the
knack
of
arrangement
yet
but
the
one
great
difference
margaret
noticed
in
the
old
woman
was
the
illuminating
smile
on
her
face
mom
wallis
had
learned
how
to
let
the
glory
gleam
through
all
the
hard
sordidness
of
her
life
and
make
earth
brighter
for
those
about
her
the
curtains
certainly
made
a
great
difference
in
the
looks
of
the
together
with
a
few
other
changes
the
men
had
made
some
chairs
three
of
them
one
out
of
a
barrel
and
together
they
had
upholstered
them
roughly
the
cots
around
the
walls
were
blazing
with
their
red
blankets
folded
smoothly
and
neatly
over
them
and
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
hearth
which
had
been
scrubbed
gardley
had
spread
a
navajo
blanket
he
had
bought
of
an
indian
the
fireplace
was
piled
with
logs
ready
for
the
lighting
at
night
and
from
somewhere
a
lamp
had
been
rigged
up
and
polished
till
it
shone
in
the
setting
sun
that
slanted
long
rays
in
at
the
shining
windows
the
men
were
washed
and
combed
and
had
been
huddled
at
the
back
of
the
for
an
hour
watching
the
road
and
now
they
came
forward
awkwardly
to
greet
their
guest
their
horny
hands
scrubbed
to
an
unbelievable
whiteness
they
did
not
say
much
but
they
looked
their
pleasure
and
margaret
greeted
every
one
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
the
charming
part
about
it
all
to
the
men
being
that
she
remembered
every
one
name
and
used
it
bud
hovered
in
the
background
and
watched
with
starry
eyes
bud
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
he
preferred
the
teacher
visiting
the
camp
rather
than
the
fort
the
howdy
sonny
which
he
had
received
from
the
men
and
the
make
yourself
at
home
bill
from
gardley
had
given
him
great
joy
and
the
whole
thing
seemed
somehow
to
link
him
to
the
teacher
in
a
most
distinguishing
manner
supper
was
ready
almost
immediately
and
mom
wallis
had
done
her
best
to
make
it
appetizing
there
was
a
lamb
stew
with
potatoes
and
fresh
corn
bread
with
coffee
the
men
ate
with
relish
and
watched
their
guest
of
honor
as
if
she
had
been
an
angel
come
down
to
abide
with
them
for
a
season
there
was
a
tablecloth
on
the
old
table
too
a
tablecloth
it
looked
remarkably
like
an
old
sheet
to
be
sure
with
a
seam
through
the
middle
where
it
had
been
worn
and
turned
and
sewed
together
but
it
was
a
tablecloth
now
and
a
marvel
to
the
men
and
the
wonder
about
margaret
was
that
she
could
eat
at
such
a
table
and
make
it
seem
as
though
that
tablecloth
were
the
finest
damask
and
the
forks
the
heaviest
of
silver
after
the
supper
was
cleared
away
and
the
lamp
lighted
the
gifts
were
brought
out
a
book
of
scotch
poetry
for
jasper
kemp
bound
in
tartan
covers
of
the
campbell
clan
a
small
illustrated
pamphlet
of
niagara
falls
for
big
jim
because
he
had
said
he
wanted
to
see
the
place
and
never
could
manage
it
a
little
pictured
folder
of
washington
city
for
big
jim
a
book
of
old
ballad
music
for
fiddling
boss
a
book
of
jokes
for
forbes
a
framed
picture
of
a
beautiful
shepherd
dog
for
stocky
a
big
red
ruffled
denim
pillow
for
croaker
because
when
she
was
there
before
he
was
always
complaining
about
the
seats
being
hard
a
great
blazing
crimson
pennant
bearing
the
name
harvard
in
big
letters
for
fudge
because
she
had
remembered
he
was
from
boston
and
for
mom
wallis
a
framed
text
beautifully
painted
in
done
in
rustic
letters
twined
with
stray
the
words
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
margaret
had
made
that
during
the
week
and
framed
it
in
a
simple
raffia
braid
of
brown
and
green
it
was
marvelous
how
these
men
liked
their
presents
and
while
they
were
examining
them
and
laughing
about
them
and
putting
their
pictures
and
mom
wallis
text
on
the
walls
and
the
pillow
on
a
bunk
and
the
pennant
over
the
fireplace
margaret
shyly
held
out
a
tiny
box
to
gardley
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
let
me
give
you
this
she
said
it
much
it
is
even
new
and
it
has
some
marks
in
it
but
i
thought
it
might
help
with
your
new
undertaking
gardley
took
it
with
a
lighting
of
his
face
and
opened
the
box
in
it
was
a
little
soft
testament
showing
the
marks
of
usage
yet
not
worn
it
was
a
tiny
thing
very
thin
easily
fitting
in
a
and
not
a
burden
to
carry
he
took
the
little
book
in
his
hand
removed
the
silken
rubber
band
that
bound
it
and
turned
the
leaves
reverently
in
his
fingers
noting
that
there
were
here
and
there
his
face
was
all
emotion
as
he
looked
up
at
the
giver
i
thank
you
he
said
in
a
low
tone
glancing
about
to
see
that
no
one
was
noticing
them
i
shall
prize
it
greatly
it
surely
will
help
i
will
read
it
every
day
was
that
what
you
wanted
and
i
will
carry
it
with
me
always
his
voice
was
very
earnest
and
he
looked
at
her
as
though
she
had
given
him
a
fortune
with
another
glance
about
at
the
preoccupied
room
even
bud
was
busy
studying
jasper
kemp
oldest
gun
he
snapped
the
band
on
the
book
again
and
put
it
carefully
in
his
inner
the
book
would
henceforth
travel
next
his
heart
and
be
his
guide
she
thought
he
meant
her
to
understand
that
as
he
put
out
his
hand
unobtrusively
and
pressed
her
fingers
gently
with
a
quick
low
thank
you
then
mom
wallis
bonnet
was
brought
out
and
tied
on
her
and
the
poor
old
woman
blushed
like
a
girl
when
she
stood
with
meek
hands
folded
at
her
waist
and
looked
primly
about
on
the
family
for
their
approval
at
margaret
request
but
that
was
nothing
to
the
way
she
stared
when
margaret
got
out
the
threefold
mirror
and
showed
her
herself
in
the
new
headgear
she
trotted
away
at
last
the
wonderful
bonnet
in
one
hand
the
box
in
the
other
a
look
of
awe
on
her
face
and
margaret
heard
her
murmur
as
she
put
it
away
glory
glory
then
margaret
had
to
read
one
or
two
of
the
poems
for
jasper
kemp
while
they
all
sat
and
listened
to
her
scotch
and
marveled
at
her
a
woman
like
that
condescending
to
come
to
visit
them
she
gave
a
lesson
in
to
the
fiddling
boss
pointing
one
by
one
with
her
white
fingers
to
the
notes
until
he
was
able
to
creep
along
and
pick
out
suwanee
river
and
old
folks
at
home
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
audience
margaret
never
knew
just
how
it
was
that
she
came
to
be
telling
the
men
a
story
one
she
had
read
not
long
before
in
a
magazine
a
story
with
a
thrilling
national
interest
and
a
keen
personal
touch
that
searched
the
hearts
of
men
but
they
listened
as
they
had
never
listened
to
anything
in
their
lives
before
and
then
there
was
singing
more
singing
until
it
bade
fair
to
be
morning
before
they
slept
and
the
little
teacher
was
weary
indeed
when
she
lay
down
on
the
cot
in
mom
wallis
room
after
having
knelt
beside
the
old
woman
and
prayed
the
next
day
there
was
a
wonderful
ride
with
gardley
and
bud
to
the
cañon
of
the
and
a
coming
home
to
the
apple
dumplings
she
had
taught
mom
wallis
to
make
before
she
went
away
all
day
gardley
and
she
with
bud
for
delighted
audience
had
talked
over
the
play
she
was
getting
up
at
the
school
gardley
suggesting
about
costumes
and
tree
boughs
for
scenery
and
promising
to
help
in
any
way
she
wanted
then
after
supper
there
were
jokes
and
songs
around
the
big
fire
and
some
popcorn
one
of
the
men
had
gone
a
long
ride
that
day
to
get
they
called
for
another
story
too
and
it
was
forthcoming
it
was
sunday
morning
after
breakfast
however
that
margaret
suddenly
wondered
how
she
was
going
to
make
the
day
helpful
and
different
from
the
other
days
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
of
the
clear
little
window
thoughtfully
with
just
the
shadow
of
a
sigh
on
her
lips
and
as
she
turned
back
to
the
room
she
met
gardley
questioning
glance
are
you
homesick
he
asked
with
a
sorry
smile
this
must
all
be
very
different
from
what
you
are
accustomed
to
oh
no
it
is
that
she
smiled
brightly
i
not
a
baby
for
home
but
i
do
get
a
bit
homesick
about
sunday
is
such
a
strange
day
to
me
without
a
service
why
not
have
one
then
he
suggested
eagerly
we
can
sing
and
you
could
do
the
rest
her
eyes
lighted
at
the
suggestion
and
she
cast
a
quick
glance
at
the
men
would
they
stand
for
that
sort
of
thing
gardley
followed
her
glance
and
caught
her
meaning
let
them
answer
for
themselves
he
said
quickly
in
a
low
tone
and
then
raising
his
voice
speak
up
men
do
you
want
to
have
church
miss
earle
here
is
homesick
for
a
service
and
i
suggest
that
we
have
one
and
she
conduct
it
sure
said
jasper
kemp
his
face
lighting
i
miss
my
guess
if
she
ca
do
better
than
the
parson
we
had
last
sunday
get
into
your
seats
boys
we
goin
to
church
margaret
face
was
a
study
of
embarrassment
and
delight
as
she
saw
the
alacrity
with
which
the
men
moved
to
get
ready
for
church
her
quick
brain
turned
over
the
possibility
of
what
she
could
read
or
say
to
help
this
strange
congregation
thus
suddenly
thrust
upon
her
it
was
a
testimony
to
her
upbringing
by
a
father
whose
great
business
of
life
was
to
preach
the
gospel
that
she
never
thought
once
of
hesitating
or
declining
the
opportunity
but
welcomed
it
as
an
opportunity
and
only
deprecated
her
unreadiness
for
the
work
the
men
stirred
about
donned
their
coats
furtively
brushing
their
hair
and
long
bill
insisted
that
mom
wallis
put
on
her
new
bonnet
which
she
obligingly
did
and
sat
down
carefully
in
the
her
hands
neatly
crossed
in
her
lap
supremely
happy
it
really
was
wonderful
what
a
difference
that
bonnet
made
in
mom
wallis
gardley
arranged
a
comfortable
seat
for
margaret
at
the
table
and
put
in
front
of
her
one
of
the
she
had
brought
then
after
she
was
seated
he
took
the
chair
beside
her
and
brought
out
the
little
testament
from
his
gravely
laying
it
on
the
margaret
met
his
eyes
with
a
look
of
quick
appreciation
it
was
wonderful
the
way
these
two
were
growing
to
understand
each
other
it
gave
the
girl
a
thrill
of
wonder
and
delight
to
have
him
do
this
simple
little
thing
for
her
and
the
smile
that
passed
between
them
was
beautiful
to
see
long
bill
turned
away
his
head
and
looked
out
of
the
window
with
an
improvised
sneeze
to
excuse
the
sudden
mist
that
came
into
his
eyes
margaret
chose
my
faith
looks
up
to
thee
for
the
first
hymn
because
fiddling
boss
could
play
it
and
while
he
was
tuning
up
his
fiddle
she
hastily
wrote
out
two
more
copies
of
the
words
and
so
the
queer
service
started
with
a
quaver
of
the
old
fiddle
and
the
clear
sweet
voices
of
margaret
and
gardley
leading
off
while
the
men
growled
on
their
way
behind
and
mom
wallis
in
her
new
gray
bonnet
with
her
hair
all
fluffed
softly
gray
under
it
sat
with
eyes
shining
like
a
girl
so
absorbed
in
the
song
were
they
all
that
they
failed
to
hear
the
sound
of
a
horse
coming
into
the
clearing
but
just
as
the
last
words
of
the
final
verse
died
away
the
door
of
the
swung
open
and
there
in
the
doorway
stood
pop
wallis
the
men
sprang
to
their
feet
with
one
accord
ominous
frowns
on
their
brows
and
poor
old
mom
wallis
sat
petrified
where
she
was
the
smile
of
relaxation
frozen
on
her
face
a
look
of
fear
growing
in
her
tired
old
eyes
now
pop
wallis
through
an
unusual
combination
of
circumstances
had
been
for
some
hours
without
liquor
and
was
comparatively
sober
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
amazedly
at
the
group
around
his
fireside
perhaps
because
he
had
been
so
long
without
his
usual
stimulant
his
mind
was
weakened
and
things
appeared
as
a
strange
vision
to
him
at
any
rate
he
stood
and
stared
and
as
he
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
men
at
the
beautiful
stranger
and
across
to
the
strangely
unfamiliar
face
of
his
wife
in
her
new
bonnet
his
eyes
took
on
a
frightened
look
he
slowly
took
his
hand
from
the
and
passed
it
over
his
eyes
then
looked
again
from
one
to
another
and
back
to
his
glorified
wife
margaret
had
half
risen
at
her
end
of
the
table
and
gardley
stood
beside
her
as
if
to
reassure
her
but
pop
wallis
was
not
looking
at
any
of
them
any
more
his
eyes
were
on
his
wife
he
passed
his
hand
once
more
over
his
eyes
and
took
one
step
gropingly
into
the
room
a
hand
reached
out
in
front
of
him
as
if
he
were
not
sure
but
he
might
run
into
something
on
the
way
the
other
hand
on
his
forehead
a
dazed
look
in
his
face
why
mom
that
ai
really
now
it
he
said
in
a
gentle
insinuating
voice
like
one
long
unaccustomed
making
a
hasty
prayer
the
tone
made
a
swift
change
in
the
old
woman
she
gripped
her
bony
hands
tight
and
a
look
of
beatific
joy
came
into
her
wrinkled
face
yes
it
really
pop
she
said
with
a
kind
of
triumphant
ring
to
her
voice
but
but
you
right
ai
you
you
ai
an
an
gone
to
be
you
you
right
yes
i
right
pop
i
ai
dead
pop
glory
to
glory
repeated
the
man
dazedly
glory
and
he
gazed
around
the
room
and
took
in
the
new
curtains
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
cushions
and
chairs
and
the
bright
shining
windows
you
do
mean
it
do
you
mom
i
better
go
back

belong
in
why
mom
it

the
new
miss
earle
and
she
goin
to
have
church
she
done
it
you
sit
down
and
listen
pop
wallis
took
a
few
hesitating
steps
into
the
room
and
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
he
looked
at
margaret
as
if
she
might
be
an
angel
holding
open
the
portal
to
a
kingdom
in
the
sky
he
looked
and
wondered
and
admired
and
then
he
looked
back
to
his
glorified
old
wife
again
in
wonder
jasper
kemp
shut
the
door
and
the
company
dropped
back
into
their
places
margaret
because
of
her
deep
embarrassment
and
a
kind
of
inward
trembling
that
had
taken
possession
of
her
announced
another
hymn
it
was
a
solemn
little
service
quite
unique
with
a
brief
simple
prayer
and
an
expository
reading
of
the
story
of
the
blind
man
from
the
sixth
chapter
of
john
the
men
sat
attentively
their
eyes
upon
her
face
as
she
read
but
pop
wallis
sat
staring
at
his
wife
an
awed
light
upon
his
scared
old
face
the
wickedness
and
cunning
all
faded
out
and
only
fear
and
wonder
written
there
in
the
early
dawning
of
the
morning
margaret
went
back
to
her
work
gardley
riding
by
her
side
and
bud
riding
at
a
discreet
distance
behind
now
and
then
going
off
at
a
tangent
after
a
stray
cottontail
it
was
wonderful
what
good
sense
bud
seemed
to
have
on
occasion
the
horse
that
margaret
rode
a
sturdy
little
western
pony
with
nerve
and
grit
and
a
gentle
common
sense
for
humans
was
to
remain
with
her
in
ashland
a
gift
from
the
men
of
the
during
the
week
that
followed
archie
forsythe
came
riding
over
with
a
beautiful
shining
for
her
use
during
her
stay
in
the
west
but
when
he
went
riding
back
to
the
ranch
the
shining
was
still
in
his
train
riderless
for
margaret
told
him
that
she
already
had
a
horse
of
her
own
neither
had
margaret
accepted
the
invitation
to
the
for
the
next
she
had
other
plans
for
the
sabbath
and
that
week
there
appeared
on
all
the
trees
and
posts
about
the
town
and
on
the
trails
a
little
notice
of
a
bible
class
and
to
be
held
in
the
on
the
following
sabbath
afternoon
and
so
margaret
true
daughter
of
her
took
up
her
mission
in
ashland
for
the
sabbaths
that
were
to
follow
for
the
had
agreed
with
alacrity
to
such
use
of
the
chapter
xxii
now
when
it
became
noised
abroad
that
the
new
teacher
wanted
above
all
things
to
purchase
a
piano
and
that
to
that
end
she
was
getting
up
a
wonderful
shakespeare
play
in
which
the
scholars
were
to
act
upon
a
stage
set
with
tree
boughs
after
the
manner
of
some
new
kind
of
players
the
whole
community
round
about
began
to
be
excited
tanner
talked
much
about
it
was
not
bud
to
be
a
prominent
character
tanner
talked
about
it
everywhere
he
went
the
mothers
and
fathers
and
sisters
talked
about
it
and
the
work
of
preparing
the
play
went
on
margaret
had
discovered
that
one
of
the
men
at
the
played
a
flute
and
she
was
working
hard
to
teach
him
and
fiddling
boss
and
croaker
to
play
a
portion
of
the
elfin
dance
to
accompany
the
players
the
work
of
making
costumes
and
training
the
actors
became
more
and
more
strenuous
and
in
this
gardley
proved
a
fine
assistant
he
undertook
to
train
some
of
the
older
boys
for
their
parts
and
did
it
so
well
that
he
was
presently
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
of
preparation
and
working
almost
as
hard
as
margaret
herself
the
beauty
of
the
whole
thing
was
that
every
boy
in
the
school
adored
him
even
jed
and
timothy
and
life
took
on
a
different
aspect
to
them
in
company
with
this
eastern
young
man
who
yet
could
ride
and
shoot
with
the
daringest
among
the
westerners
far
and
wide
went
forth
the
fame
of
the
play
that
was
to
be
the
news
of
it
reached
to
the
fort
and
the
ranches
and
brought
offers
of
assistance
and
costumes
and
orders
for
tickets
margaret
purchased
a
small
duplicator
and
set
her
school
to
printing
tickets
and
selling
them
and
before
the
play
was
half
ready
to
be
acted
tickets
enough
were
sold
for
two
performances
and
people
were
planning
to
come
from
fifty
miles
around
the
young
teacher
began
to
quake
at
the
thought
of
her
big
audience
and
her
poor
little
amateur
players
and
yet
for
children
they
were
doing
wonderfully
well
and
were
growing
quite
shakespearian
in
their
manner
of
conversation
what
say
you
sweet
amanda
would
be
a
form
of
frequent
address
to
that
stolid
maiden
amanda
bounds
and
jed
instead
of
shouting
for
delicate
at
recess
as
in
former
times
would
say
my
good
timothy
i
swear
to
thee
by
cupid
strongest
bow
by
his
best
arrow
with
the
golden
head
until
all
the
rang
with
classic
phrases
and
the
whole
country
round
was
being
addressed
in
phrases
of
another
century
by
the
younger
members
of
their
households
then
rosa
rogers
father
one
day
stopped
at
the
tanners
and
left
a
contribution
with
the
teacher
of
fifty
dollars
toward
the
new
piano
and
after
that
it
was
rumored
that
the
teacher
said
the
piano
could
be
sent
for
in
time
to
be
used
at
the
play
then
other
contributions
of
smaller
amounts
came
in
and
before
the
date
of
the
play
had
been
set
there
was
money
enough
to
make
a
first
payment
on
the
piano
that
day
the
english
exercise
for
the
whole
school
was
to
compose
the
letter
to
the
eastern
piano
firm
where
the
piano
was
to
be
purchased
ordering
it
to
be
sent
on
at
once
weeks
before
this
margaret
had
sent
for
a
number
of
piano
catalogues
beautifully
illustrated
showing
by
cuts
how
the
whole
instruments
were
made
with
full
illustrations
of
the
factories
where
they
were
manufactured
and
she
had
discussed
the
selection
with
the
scholars
showing
them
what
points
were
to
be
considered
in
selecting
a
good
piano
at
last
the
order
was
sent
out
the
actual
selection
itself
to
be
made
by
a
musical
friend
of
margaret
in
new
york
and
the
school
waited
in
anxious
suspense
to
hear
that
it
had
started
on
its
way
the
piano
arrived
at
last
three
weeks
before
the
time
set
for
the
play
which
was
coming
on
finely
now
and
seemed
to
the
eager
scholars
quite
ready
for
public
performance
not
so
to
margaret
and
gardley
as
daily
they
pruned
trained
and
patiently
went
over
and
over
again
each
part
drawing
all
the
while
nearer
to
the
ideal
they
had
set
it
could
not
be
done
perfectly
of
course
and
when
they
had
done
all
they
could
there
would
yet
be
many
crudities
but
margaret
hope
was
to
bring
out
the
meaning
of
the
play
and
give
both
audience
and
performers
the
true
idea
of
what
shakespeare
meant
when
he
wrote
it
the
arrival
of
the
piano
was
naturally
a
great
event
in
the
school
for
three
days
in
succession
the
entire
school
marched
in
procession
down
to
the
incoming
eastern
train
to
see
if
their
expected
treasure
had
arrived
and
when
at
last
it
was
lifted
from
the
and
set
upon
the
station
platform
the
school
stood
and
silent
with
heads
and
bated
breath
as
though
at
the
arrival
of
some
great
and
honorable
guest
they
attended
it
on
the
roadside
as
it
was
carted
by
the
biggest
wagon
in
town
to
the
door
they
stood
in
silent
rows
while
the
great
box
was
peeled
off
and
the
instrument
taken
out
and
carried
into
the
then
they
filed
in
soulfully
and
took
their
accustomed
seats
without
being
told
touching
shyly
the
shining
case
as
they
passed
by
common
consent
they
waited
to
hear
its
voice
for
the
first
time
margaret
took
the
little
key
from
the
envelope
tied
to
the
frame
unlocked
the
cover
and
sitting
down
began
to
play
the
rough
men
who
had
brought
it
stood
in
awesome
adoration
around
the
platform
the
silence
that
spread
over
that
room
would
have
done
honor
to
paderewski
or
josef
hoffman
margaret
played
and
played
and
they
could
not
hear
enough
they
would
have
stayed
all
night
listening
perhaps
so
wonderful
was
it
to
them
and
then
the
teacher
called
each
one
and
let
him
or
her
touch
a
few
chords
just
to
say
they
had
played
on
it
after
which
she
locked
the
instrument
and
sent
them
all
home
that
was
the
only
afternoon
during
that
term
that
the
play
was
forgotten
for
a
while
after
the
arrival
of
the
piano
the
play
went
forward
with
great
strides
for
now
margaret
accompanied
some
of
the
parts
with
the
music
and
the
flute
and
violin
were
also
practised
in
their
elfin
dance
with
much
better
effect
it
was
about
this
time
that
archie
forsythe
discovered
the
rehearsals
and
offered
his
assistance
and
although
it
was
declined
he
frequently
managed
to
ride
over
about
rehearsal
time
finding
ways
to
make
himself
useful
in
spite
of
margaret
polite
refusals
margaret
always
felt
annoyed
when
he
came
because
rosa
rogers
instantly
became
another
creature
on
his
arrival
and
because
gardley
simply
froze
into
a
polite
statue
never
speaking
except
when
spoken
to
as
for
forsythe
his
attitude
toward
gardley
was
that
of
a
contemptuous
master
toward
a
slave
and
yet
he
took
care
to
cover
it
always
with
a
form
of
courtesy
so
that
margaret
could
say
or
do
nothing
to
show
her
displeasure
except
to
be
grave
and
dignified
at
such
times
rosa
rogers
eyes
would
be
upon
her
with
a
gleam
of
hatred
and
the
teacher
felt
that
the
scholar
was
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
altogether
it
was
a
trying
time
for
margaret
when
forsythe
came
to
the
also
he
discovered
to
them
that
he
played
the
violin
and
offered
to
assist
in
the
orchestral
parts
margaret
really
could
think
of
no
reason
to
decline
this
offer
but
she
was
sadly
upset
by
the
whole
thing
his
manner
to
her
was
too
pronounced
and
she
felt
continually
uncomfortable
under
it
what
with
rosa
rogers
jealous
eyes
upon
her
and
gardley
eyes
turned
haughtily
away
she
planned
a
number
of
special
rehearsals
in
the
evenings
when
it
was
difficult
for
forsythe
to
get
there
and
managed
in
this
way
to
avoid
his
presence
but
the
whole
matter
became
a
source
of
much
vexation
and
margaret
even
shed
a
few
tears
wearily
into
her
pillow
one
night
when
things
had
gone
particularly
hard
and
forsythe
had
hurt
the
feelings
of
fiddling
boss
with
his
insolent
directions
about
playing
she
could
not
say
or
do
anything
much
in
the
matter
because
the
temples
had
been
very
kind
in
helping
to
get
the
piano
and
temple
seemed
to
think
he
was
doing
the
greatest
possible
kindness
to
her
in
letting
forsythe
off
duty
so
much
to
help
with
the
play
the
matter
became
more
and
more
of
a
distress
to
margaret
and
the
sabbath
was
the
only
day
of
real
delight
the
first
sunday
after
the
arrival
of
the
piano
was
a
great
day
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
turned
out
to
the
class
and
vesper
service
which
had
been
growing
more
and
more
in
popularity
until
now
the
was
crowded
every
man
from
the
came
regularly
often
including
pop
wallis
who
had
not
yet
recovered
fully
from
the
effect
of
his
wife
new
bonnet
and
fluffy
arrangement
of
hair
but
treated
her
like
a
lady
visitor
and
deferred
to
her
absolutely
when
he
was
at
home
he
was
quite
sure
even
yet
but
he
had
strayed
by
mistake
into
the
outermost
courts
of
heaven
and
ought
to
get
shooed
out
he
always
looked
at
the
curtains
with
a
mingling
of
pride
and
awe
margaret
had
put
several
hymns
on
the
blackboard
in
clear
bold
printing
and
the
singing
that
day
was
wonderful
not
the
least
part
of
the
service
was
her
own
playing
over
of
the
hymns
before
the
singing
began
which
was
listened
to
with
reverence
as
if
it
had
been
the
music
of
an
angel
playing
on
a
heavenly
harp
gardley
always
came
to
the
sunday
services
and
helped
her
with
the
singing
and
often
they
two
sang
duets
together
the
service
was
not
always
of
set
form
usually
margaret
taught
a
short
bible
lesson
beginning
with
the
general
outline
of
the
bible
its
books
their
form
substance
authors
all
very
brief
and
exceedingly
simple
putting
a
wide
space
of
music
between
this
and
the
vesper
service
into
which
she
wove
songs
bits
of
poems
passages
from
the
bible
and
often
a
story
which
she
told
dramatically
illustrating
the
scripture
read
but
the
very
sunday
before
the
play
just
the
time
margaret
had
looked
forward
to
as
being
her
rest
from
all
the
perplexities
of
the
week
a
company
from
the
fort
including
the
temples
arrived
at
the
right
in
the
midst
of
the
bible
lesson
the
ladies
were
daintily
dressed
and
settled
their
frills
and
ribbons
amusedly
as
they
watched
the
embarrassed
young
teacher
trying
to
forget
that
there
was
company
present
they
were
in
a
distinct
sense
company
for
they
had
the
air
as
they
entered
of
having
come
to
look
on
and
be
amused
not
to
partake
in
the
worship
with
the
rest
margaret
found
herself
trembling
inwardly
as
she
saw
the
supercilious
smile
on
the
lips
of
temple
and
the
amused
stares
of
the
other
ladies
of
the
party
they
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
other
people
present
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
so
many
puppets
set
up
to
show
off
the
teacher
their
air
of
superiority
was
offensive
not
until
rosa
rogers
entered
with
her
father
a
little
later
did
they
condescend
to
bow
in
recognition
and
then
with
that
pretty
little
atmosphere
as
if
they
would
say
oh
you
come
too
to
be
amused
gardley
was
sitting
up
in
front
listening
to
her
talk
and
she
thought
he
had
not
noticed
the
strangers
suddenly
it
came
to
her
to
try
to
keep
her
nerve
and
let
him
see
that
they
were
nothing
to
her
and
with
a
strong
effort
and
a
swift
prayer
for
help
she
called
for
a
hymn
she
sat
coolly
down
at
the
piano
touching
the
keys
with
a
tender
chord
or
two
and
beginning
to
sing
almost
at
once
she
had
sent
home
for
some
old
from
the
christian
endeavor
society
in
her
father
church
so
the
congregation
were
supplied
with
the
notes
and
words
now
and
everybody
took
part
eagerly
even
the
people
from
the
fort
condescendingly
joining
in
but
gardley
was
too
much
alive
to
every
expression
on
that
vivid
face
of
margaret
to
miss
knowing
that
she
was
annoyed
and
upset
he
did
not
need
to
turn
and
look
back
to
immediately
discover
the
cause
he
was
a
young
person
of
keen
intuition
it
suddenly
gave
him
great
satisfaction
to
see
that
look
of
consternation
on
margaret
face
it
settled
for
him
a
question
he
had
been
in
great
and
anxious
doubt
about
and
his
soul
was
lifted
up
with
peace
within
him
when
presently
according
to
arrangement
he
rose
to
sing
a
duet
with
margaret
no
one
could
have
possibly
told
by
so
much
as
the
lifting
of
an
eyelash
that
he
knew
there
was
an
enemy
of
his
in
the
back
of
the
room
he
sang
as
did
margaret
to
the
immediate
audience
in
front
of
him
those
admiring
children
and
adoring
men
in
the
forefront
who
felt
the
had
become
for
them
the
gate
of
heaven
for
the
time
being
and
he
sang
with
marvelous
feeling
and
sympathy
letting
out
his
voice
at
its
best
really
said
temple
in
a
loud
whisper
to
the
wife
of
one
of
the
officers
that
young
man
has
a
fine
voice
and
he
is
either
i
think
he
be
worth
cultivating
we
must
have
him
up
and
try
him
out
but
when
she
repeated
this
remark
in
another
stage
whisper
to
forsythe
he
frowned
haughtily
the
one
glimpse
margaret
caught
of
forsythe
during
that
service
was
when
he
was
smiling
meaningly
at
rosa
rogers
and
she
had
to
resolutely
put
the
memory
of
their
look
from
her
mind
or
the
story
which
she
was
about
to
tell
would
have
fled
it
was
the
hunger
in
jasper
kemp
eyes
that
finally
anchored
thoughts
and
helped
her
to
forget
the
company
at
the
back
of
the
room
she
told
her
story
and
she
told
it
wonderfully
and
with
power
interpreting
it
now
and
then
for
the
row
of
men
who
sat
in
the
center
of
the
room
drinking
in
her
every
word
and
when
the
simple
service
was
concluded
with
another
song
in
which
gardley
voice
rang
forth
with
peculiar
tenderness
and
strength
the
men
filed
forth
silently
solemnly
with
bowed
heads
and
thoughtful
eyes
but
the
company
from
the
fort
flowed
up
around
margaret
like
let
loose
and
gushed
upon
her
oh
my
dear
said
temple
how
beautifully
you
do
it
and
such
attention
as
they
give
you
no
wonder
you
are
willing
to
forego
all
other
amusements
to
stay
here
and
preach
but
it
was
perfectly
sweet
the
way
you
made
them
listen
and
the
way
you
told
that
story
i
do
see
how
you
do
it
i
be
scared
to
death
they
babbled
about
her
awhile
much
to
her
annoyance
for
there
were
several
people
to
whom
she
had
wanted
to
speak
who
drew
away
and
disappeared
when
the
took
possession
of
her
at
last
however
they
mounted
and
rode
away
to
her
great
relief
forsythe
it
is
true
tried
to
make
her
go
home
with
them
tried
to
escort
her
to
the
tanners
tried
to
remain
in
the
with
her
awhile
when
she
told
him
she
had
something
to
do
there
but
she
would
not
let
him
and
he
rode
away
half
sulky
at
the
last
a
look
of
injured
pride
upon
his
face
margaret
went
to
the
door
finally
and
looked
down
the
road
he
was
gone
and
she
was
alone
a
shade
of
sadness
came
over
her
face
she
was
sorry
that
gardley
had
not
waited
she
had
wanted
to
tell
him
how
much
she
liked
his
singing
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
sing
with
him
and
how
glad
she
was
that
he
came
up
to
her
need
so
well
with
the
strangers
there
and
helped
to
make
it
easy
but
gardley
had
melted
away
as
soon
as
the
service
was
over
and
had
probably
gone
home
with
the
rest
of
the
men
it
was
disappointing
for
she
had
come
to
consider
their
little
time
together
on
sunday
as
a
very
pleasant
hour
this
few
minutes
after
the
service
when
they
would
talk
about
real
living
and
the
vital
things
of
existence
but
he
was
gone
she
turned
and
there
he
was
quite
near
the
door
coming
toward
her
her
face
lighted
up
with
a
joy
that
was
unmistakable
and
his
own
smile
in
answer
was
a
revelation
of
his
deeper
self
oh
i
so
glad
you
are
not
gone
she
said
eagerly
i
wanted
to
tell
you
and
then
she
stopped
and
the
color
flooded
her
face
rosily
for
she
saw
in
his
eyes
how
glad
he
was
and
forgot
to
finish
her
sentence
he
came
up
gravely
after
all
and
standing
just
a
minute
so
beside
the
door
took
both
her
hands
in
both
his
it
was
only
for
a
second
that
he
stood
so
looking
down
into
her
eyes
i
doubt
if
either
of
them
knew
till
afterward
that
they
had
been
holding
hands
it
seemed
the
right
and
natural
thing
to
do
and
meant
so
much
to
each
of
them
both
were
glad
beyond
their
own
understanding
over
that
moment
and
its
tenderness
it
was
all
very
decorous
and
over
in
a
second
but
it
meant
much
to
remember
afterward
that
look
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
said
tenderly
how
much
that
story
did
for
me
it
was
wonderful
and
it
helped
me
to
decide
something
i
have
been
perplexed
over
oh
i
am
glad
she
said
half
breathlessly
so
talking
in
low
broken
sentences
they
went
back
to
the
piano
and
tried
over
several
songs
for
the
next
sunday
lingering
together
just
happy
to
be
there
with
each
other
and
not
half
knowing
the
significance
of
it
all
as
the
purple
lights
on
the
wall
grew
long
and
they
walked
slowly
to
the
tanner
house
and
said
good
night
there
was
a
beauty
about
the
young
man
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
upon
the
girl
in
parting
the
kind
of
beauty
there
is
in
any
strong
wild
thing
made
tame
and
tender
for
a
great
love
by
a
great
uplift
gardley
had
that
look
of
and
power
made
subservient
to
right
that
crowns
a
man
with
strength
and
more
than
physical
beauty
in
his
fine
face
there
glowed
high
purpose
and
deep
devotion
to
the
one
who
had
taught
it
to
him
margaret
looking
up
at
him
felt
her
heart
go
out
with
that
great
love
half
maiden
half
divine
that
comes
to
some
favored
women
even
here
on
earth
and
she
watched
him
down
the
road
toward
the
mountain
in
the
evening
light
and
marveled
how
her
trust
had
grown
since
first
she
met
him
marveled
and
reflected
that
she
had
not
told
her
mother
and
father
much
about
him
yet
it
was
growing
time
to
do
so
yes
was
growing
her
cheeks
grew
pink
in
the
darkness
and
she
turned
and
fled
to
her
room
that
was
the
last
time
she
saw
him
before
the
play
chapter
xxiii
the
play
was
set
for
tuesday
monday
afternoon
and
evening
were
to
be
the
final
rehearsals
but
gardley
did
not
come
to
them
fiddling
boss
came
late
and
said
the
men
had
been
off
all
day
and
had
not
yet
returned
he
himself
found
it
hard
to
come
at
all
they
had
important
work
on
but
there
was
no
word
from
gardley
margaret
was
disappointed
she
could
get
away
from
it
of
course
they
could
go
on
with
the
rehearsal
without
him
he
had
done
his
work
well
and
there
was
no
real
reason
why
he
had
to
be
there
he
knew
every
part
by
heart
and
could
take
any
boy
place
if
any
one
failed
in
any
way
there
was
nothing
further
really
for
him
to
do
until
the
performance
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
except
be
there
and
encourage
her
but
she
missed
him
and
an
uneasiness
grew
in
her
mind
she
had
so
looked
forward
to
seeing
him
and
now
to
have
no
word
he
might
at
least
have
sent
her
a
note
when
he
found
he
could
not
come
still
she
knew
this
was
unreasonable
his
work
whatever
it
was
he
had
never
explained
it
very
thoroughly
to
her
perhaps
because
she
had
never
asked
must
of
course
have
kept
him
she
must
excuse
him
without
question
and
go
on
with
the
business
of
the
hour
her
hands
were
full
enough
for
forsythe
came
presently
and
was
more
trying
than
usual
she
had
to
be
very
decided
and
put
her
foot
down
about
one
or
two
things
or
some
of
her
actors
would
have
gone
home
in
the
sulks
and
fiddling
boss
whose
part
in
the
program
meant
much
to
him
would
have
given
it
up
entirely
she
hurried
everything
through
as
soon
as
possible
knowing
she
was
weary
and
longing
to
get
to
her
room
and
rest
gardley
would
come
and
explain
likely
in
the
morning
on
his
way
somewhere
but
the
morning
came
and
no
word
afternoon
came
and
he
had
not
sent
a
sign
yet
some
of
the
little
things
that
he
had
promised
to
do
about
the
setting
of
the
stage
would
have
to
remain
undone
for
it
was
too
late
now
to
do
it
herself
and
there
was
no
one
else
to
call
upon
into
the
midst
of
her
perplexity
and
anxiety
came
the
news
that
jed
on
his
way
home
had
been
thrown
from
his
horse
which
was
a
young
and
vicious
one
and
had
broken
his
leg
jed
was
to
act
the
part
of
nick
bottom
that
evening
and
he
did
it
well
now
what
in
the
world
was
she
to
do
if
only
gardley
would
come
just
at
this
moment
forsythe
arrived
oh
it
is
you
mr
forsythe
and
her
tone
showed
plainly
her
disappointment
have
you
seen
gardley
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
him
i
certainly
have
seen
gardley
said
forsythe
a
spice
of
vindictiveness
and
satisfaction
in
his
tone
i
saw
him
not
two
hours
ago
drunk
as
a
fish
out
at
a
place
called
old
ouida
cabin
as
i
was
passing
he
in
for
a
regular
spree
you
not
see
him
for
several
days
i
fancy
he
utterly
helpless
for
the
present
and
out
of
the
question
what
is
there
i
can
do
for
you
present
your
request
yours
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
margaret
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
and
then
like
fire
her
blood
seemed
to
stop
utterly
and
then
to
go
pounding
through
her
veins
in
leaps
and
torrents
her
eyes
grew
dark
and
things
swam
before
her
she
reached
out
to
a
desk
and
caught
at
it
for
support
and
her
white
face
looked
at
him
a
moment
as
if
she
had
not
heard
but
when
in
a
second
she
spoke
she
said
quite
steadily
i
thank
you
forsythe
there
is
nothing
just
at
present
or
yes
there
is
if
you
would
mind
helping
timothy
put
up
those
curtains
now
i
think
i
go
home
and
rest
a
few
minutes
i
am
very
tired
it
was
exactly
the
job
forsythe
coveted
to
stay
in
the
and
fuss
over
those
curtains
but
she
made
him
do
it
then
disappeared
and
he
did
like
the
memory
of
her
white
face
he
had
thought
she
would
take
it
that
way
he
had
expected
to
have
her
exclaim
with
horror
and
disgust
he
watched
her
out
of
the
door
and
then
turned
impatiently
to
the
waiting
timothy
margaret
went
outside
the
to
call
bud
who
had
been
sent
to
gather
for
filling
in
the
background
but
bud
was
already
out
of
sight
far
on
the
trail
toward
the
camp
on
forsythe
horse
riding
for
dear
life
bud
had
come
near
to
the
door
with
his
armful
of
just
in
time
to
hear
forsythe
flippant
speech
about
gardley
and
see
margaret
white
face
bud
had
gone
for
help
but
margaret
did
not
go
home
to
rest
she
did
not
even
get
home
when
she
had
gone
a
very
short
distance
outside
the
she
saw
some
one
coming
toward
her
and
in
her
distress
of
mind
she
could
not
tell
who
it
was
her
eyes
were
blinded
with
tears
her
breath
was
constricted
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
demon
unseen
was
gripping
her
heart
she
had
not
yet
taken
her
bearings
to
know
what
she
thought
she
had
only
just
come
dazed
from
the
shock
of
forsythe
words
and
had
not
the
power
to
think
over
and
over
to
herself
as
she
walked
along
she
kept
repeating
the
words
i
believe
it
it
is
true
but
her
inner
consciousness
had
not
had
time
to
analyze
her
soul
and
be
sure
that
she
believed
the
words
wherewith
she
was
comforting
herself
so
now
when
she
saw
some
one
coming
she
felt
the
necessity
of
bringing
her
telltale
face
to
order
and
getting
ready
to
answer
whoever
she
was
to
meet
as
she
drew
nearer
she
became
suddenly
aware
that
it
was
rosa
rogers
coming
with
her
arms
full
of
bundles
and
more
piled
up
in
front
of
her
on
her
pony
margaret
knew
at
once
that
rosa
must
have
seen
forsythe
go
by
her
house
and
had
returned
promptly
to
the
on
some
pretext
or
other
it
would
not
do
to
let
her
go
there
alone
with
the
young
man
she
must
go
back
and
stay
with
them
she
could
not
be
sure
that
if
she
sent
rosa
home
with
orders
to
rest
she
would
be
obeyed
doubtless
the
girl
would
take
another
way
around
and
return
to
the
school
again
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
and
stay
as
long
as
rosa
did
margaret
stooped
and
hastily
plucking
a
great
armful
of
turned
around
and
retraced
her
steps
her
heart
like
lead
her
feet
suddenly
grown
heavy
how
could
she
go
back
and
hear
them
laugh
and
chatter
answer
their
many
silly
unnecessary
questions
and
stand
it
all
how
could
she
with
that
great
weight
at
her
heart
she
went
back
with
a
wonderful
forsythe
face
lighted
and
his
reluctant
hand
grew
suddenly
eager
as
he
worked
rosa
came
presently
and
others
and
the
laughing
chatter
went
on
quite
as
margaret
had
known
it
would
and
she
so
great
is
the
power
of
human
will
under
pressure
went
calmly
about
and
directed
here
and
there
planned
and
executed
put
little
dainty
wholly
unnecessary
touches
to
the
stage
and
never
let
any
one
know
that
her
heart
was
being
crushed
with
the
weight
of
a
great
awful
fear
and
yet
steadily
upborne
by
the
rising
of
a
great
deep
trust
as
she
worked
and
smiled
and
ordered
she
was
praying
oh
god
do
let
it
be
true
keep
him
save
him
bring
him
make
him
true
i
he
is
true
oh
god
bring
him
safely
meantime
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
she
could
not
send
forsythe
after
him
she
could
not
speak
of
the
matter
to
one
of
those
present
and
bud
where
was
bud
it
was
the
first
time
since
she
came
to
arizona
that
bud
had
failed
her
she
might
not
leave
the
with
forsythe
and
rosa
there
to
go
and
find
him
and
she
might
not
do
anything
else
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
work
on
feverishly
and
pray
as
she
had
never
prayed
before
by
and
by
one
of
the
smaller
boys
came
and
she
sent
him
back
to
the
tanners
to
find
bud
but
he
returned
with
the
message
that
bud
had
not
been
home
since
morning
and
so
the
last
hours
before
the
evening
that
would
otherwise
have
been
so
brief
for
all
there
was
to
be
done
dragged
their
weary
length
away
and
margaret
worked
on
she
did
not
even
go
back
for
supper
at
the
last
but
sent
one
of
the
girls
to
her
room
for
a
few
things
she
needed
and
declined
even
the
nice
little
chicken
sandwich
that
thoughtful
tanner
sent
back
along
with
the
things
and
then
at
last
the
audience
began
to
gather
by
this
time
her
anxiety
was
so
great
for
gardley
that
all
thought
of
how
she
was
to
supply
the
place
of
the
absent
jed
had
gone
from
her
mind
which
was
in
a
whirl
gardley
gardley
if
only
gardley
would
come
that
was
her
one
thought
what
should
she
do
if
he
did
come
at
all
how
should
she
explain
things
to
herself
afterward
what
if
it
had
been
true
what
if
he
were
the
kind
of
man
forsythe
had
suggested
how
terrible
life
would
look
to
her
but
it
was
not
true
no
it
was
not
true
she
trusted
him
with
her
soul
she
trusted
him
he
would
come
back
some
time
and
he
would
explain
all
she
could
not
remember
his
last
look
at
her
on
sunday
and
not
trust
him
he
was
true
he
would
come
somehow
she
managed
to
get
through
the
terrible
interval
to
slip
into
the
and
make
herself
sweet
and
comely
in
the
little
white
gown
she
had
sent
for
with
its
delicate
blue
ribbons
and
soft
lace
ruffles
somehow
she
managed
the
expected
smiles
as
one
and
another
of
the
audience
came
around
to
the
platform
to
speak
to
her
there
were
dark
hollows
under
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
was
drawn
and
weary
but
they
laid
that
to
the
excitement
two
spots
glowed
on
her
cheeks
but
she
smiled
and
talked
with
her
usual
gaiety
people
looked
at
her
and
said
how
beautiful
she
was
and
how
bright
and
untiring
and
how
wonderful
it
was
that
ashland
school
had
drawn
such
a
prize
of
a
teacher
the
seats
filled
the
noise
and
the
clatter
went
on
still
no
sign
of
gardley
or
any
one
from
the
camp
and
still
bud
had
not
returned
what
could
it
mean
but
the
minutes
were
rushing
rapidly
now
it
was
more
than
time
to
begin
the
girls
were
in
a
flutter
in
one
at
the
right
of
the
stage
asking
more
questions
in
a
minute
than
one
could
answer
in
an
hour
the
boys
in
the
other
wanted
all
sorts
of
help
and
three
or
four
of
the
actors
were
attacked
with
as
they
peered
through
a
hole
in
the
curtain
and
saw
some
friend
or
relative
arrive
and
sit
down
in
the
audience
it
was
all
a
mad
whirl
of
seemingly
useless
noise
and
excitement
and
she
could
not
no
she
go
on
and
do
the
necessary
things
to
start
that
awful
play
why
oh
had
she
ever
been
left
to
think
of
getting
up
a
play
forsythe
up
behind
the
piano
whispered
to
her
that
it
was
time
to
begin
the
house
was
full
there
was
not
room
for
another
soul
margaret
explained
that
fiddling
boss
had
not
yet
arrived
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
cunning
designs
of
forsythe
in
the
shifty
turning
away
of
his
eyes
as
he
answered
that
they
could
not
wait
all
night
for
him
that
if
he
wanted
to
get
into
it
he
ought
to
have
come
early
but
even
as
she
turned
away
she
saw
the
little
bobbing
eager
faces
of
pop
and
mom
wallis
away
back
by
the
door
and
the
grim
towering
figure
of
the
boss
his
fiddle
held
high
making
his
way
to
the
front
amid
the
crowd
she
sat
down
and
touched
the
keys
her
eyes
watching
eagerly
for
a
chance
to
speak
to
the
boss
and
see
if
he
knew
anything
of
gardley
but
forsythe
was
close
beside
her
all
the
time
and
there
was
no
opportunity
she
struck
the
opening
chords
of
the
overture
they
were
to
attempt
to
play
and
somehow
got
through
it
of
course
the
audience
was
not
a
critical
one
and
there
were
few
real
judges
of
music
present
but
it
may
be
that
the
truly
wonderful
effect
she
produced
upon
the
listeners
was
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
playing
a
prayer
with
her
heart
as
her
fingers
touched
the
keys
and
that
instead
of
a
preliminary
to
a
fairy
revel
the
music
told
the
story
of
a
great
soul
struggle
and
reached
hearts
as
it
tinkled
and
rolled
and
swelled
on
to
the
end
it
may
be
too
that
fiddling
boss
was
more
in
sympathy
that
night
with
his
accompanist
than
was
the
other
violinist
and
that
was
why
his
old
fiddle
brought
forth
such
weird
and
tender
tones
almost
to
the
end
with
her
heart
sobbing
its
trouble
to
the
keys
margaret
looked
up
sadly
and
there
straight
before
her
through
a
hole
in
the
curtain
made
by
some
rash
youth
to
glimpse
the
audience
or
perhaps
even
put
there
by
the
owner
of
the
nose
itself
she
saw
the
little
freckled
member
belonging
to
bud
face
a
second
more
and
a
big
bright
eye
appeared
and
solemnly
winked
at
her
twice
as
if
to
say
do
you
worry
it
all
right
she
almost
started
from
the
stool
but
kept
her
head
enough
to
finish
the
chords
and
as
they
died
away
she
heard
a
hoarse
whisper
in
familiar
voice
whoop
her
up
miss
earle
we
all
ready
raise
the
curtain
there
you
guy
let
her
rip
everything
with
a
leap
of
light
into
her
eyes
margaret
turned
the
leaves
of
the
music
and
went
on
playing
as
she
should
have
done
if
nothing
had
been
the
matter
bud
was
there
anyway
and
that
somehow
cheered
her
heart
perhaps
gardley
had
come
or
bud
had
heard
of
him
and
yet
bud
know
he
had
been
missing
for
bud
had
been
away
himself
nevertheless
she
summoned
courage
to
go
on
playing
nick
bottom
in
this
first
scene
anyway
and
this
would
have
to
be
gone
through
with
somehow
by
this
time
she
was
in
a
state
of
daze
that
only
thought
from
moment
to
moment
the
end
of
the
evening
seemed
now
to
her
as
far
off
as
the
end
of
a
hale
old
age
seems
at
the
beginning
of
a
lifetime
somehow
she
must
walk
through
it
but
she
could
only
see
a
step
at
a
time
once
she
turned
half
sideways
to
the
audience
and
gave
a
hurried
glance
about
catching
sight
of
fudge
round
face
and
that
gave
her
encouragement
perhaps
the
others
were
somewhere
present
if
only
she
could
get
a
chance
to
whisper
to
some
one
from
the
camp
and
ask
when
they
had
seen
gardley
last
but
there
was
no
chance
of
course
the
curtain
was
rapidly
raised
and
the
opening
scene
of
the
play
began
the
actors
going
through
their
parts
with
marvelous
ease
and
dexterity
and
the
audience
silent
and
charmed
watching
those
strangers
in
queer
costumes
that
were
their
own
children
marching
around
there
at
their
ease
and
talking
weird
language
that
was
not
used
in
any
class
of
society
they
had
ever
come
across
on
sea
or
land
before
but
margaret
watching
her
music
as
best
she
could
and
playing
mechanically
rather
than
with
her
mind
could
not
tell
if
they
were
doing
well
or
ill
so
loudly
did
her
heart
pound
out
her
fears
so
stoutly
did
her
heart
proclaim
her
trust
and
thus
without
a
flaw
or
mistake
in
the
execution
of
the
work
she
had
struggled
so
hard
to
teach
them
the
first
scene
of
the
first
act
drew
to
its
close
and
margaret
struck
the
final
chords
of
the
music
and
felt
that
in
another
minute
she
must
reel
and
fall
from
that
and
yet
she
sat
and
watched
the
curtain
fall
with
a
face
as
controlled
as
if
nothing
at
all
were
the
matter
a
second
later
she
suddenly
knew
that
to
sit
in
that
place
calmly
another
second
was
a
physical
impossibility
she
must
get
somewhere
to
the
air
at
once
or
her
senses
would
desert
her
with
a
movement
so
quick
that
no
one
could
have
anticipated
it
she
slipped
from
her
under
the
curtain
to
the
stage
and
was
gone
before
the
rest
of
the
orchestra
had
noticed
her
intention
chapter
xxiv
since
the
day
that
he
had
given
margaret
his
promise
to
make
good
gardley
had
been
regularly
employed
by
rogers
looking
after
important
matters
of
his
ranch
before
that
he
had
lived
a
free
and
easy
life
working
a
little
now
and
then
when
it
seemed
desirable
to
him
having
no
set
interest
in
life
and
only
endeavoring
from
day
to
day
to
put
as
far
as
possible
from
his
mind
the
life
he
had
left
behind
him
now
however
all
things
became
different
he
brought
to
his
service
the
keen
mind
and
ready
ability
that
had
made
him
easily
a
winner
at
any
game
a
brave
rider
and
a
shot
within
a
few
days
rogers
saw
what
material
was
in
him
and
as
the
weeks
went
by
grew
to
depend
more
and
more
upon
his
advice
in
matters
there
had
been
much
trouble
with
cattle
thieves
and
so
far
no
method
of
stopping
the
loss
or
catching
the
thieves
had
been
successful
rogers
finally
put
the
matter
into
gardley
hands
to
carry
out
his
own
ideas
with
the
men
of
the
camp
at
his
command
to
help
him
the
camp
itself
being
only
a
part
of
rogers
outlying
possessions
one
of
several
such
centers
from
which
he
worked
his
growing
interests
gardley
had
formulated
a
scheme
by
which
he
hoped
eventually
to
get
hold
of
the
thieves
and
put
a
stop
to
the
trouble
and
he
was
pretty
sure
he
was
on
the
right
track
but
his
plan
required
slow
and
cautious
work
that
the
enemy
might
not
suspect
and
take
to
cover
he
had
for
several
weeks
suspected
that
the
thieves
made
their
headquarters
in
the
region
of
old
ouida
cabin
and
made
their
raids
from
that
direction
it
was
for
this
reason
that
of
late
the
woods
and
trails
in
the
vicinity
of
ouida
had
been
secretly
patrolled
day
and
night
and
every
taken
note
of
until
gardley
knew
just
who
were
the
frequenters
of
that
way
and
mostly
what
was
their
business
this
work
was
done
alternately
by
the
men
of
the
wallis
camp
and
two
other
camps
gardley
being
the
head
of
all
and
carrying
all
responsibility
and
not
the
least
of
that
young
man
offenses
in
the
eyes
of
rosa
rogers
was
that
he
was
so
constantly
at
her
father
house
and
yet
never
lifted
an
eye
in
admiration
of
her
pretty
face
she
longed
to
humiliate
him
and
through
him
to
humiliate
margaret
who
presumed
to
interfere
with
her
flirtations
for
it
was
a
bitter
thing
to
rosa
that
forsythe
had
no
eyes
for
her
when
margaret
was
about
when
the
party
from
the
fort
rode
homeward
that
sunday
after
the
service
at
the
forsythe
lingered
behind
to
talk
to
margaret
and
then
rode
around
by
the
rogers
place
where
rosa
and
he
had
long
ago
established
a
rosa
was
watching
for
his
passing
and
he
stopped
a
or
so
to
talk
to
her
during
this
time
she
casually
disclosed
to
forsythe
some
of
the
plans
she
had
overheard
gardley
laying
before
her
father
rosa
had
very
little
idea
of
the
importance
of
gardley
work
to
her
father
or
perhaps
she
would
not
have
so
readily
prattled
of
his
affairs
her
main
idea
was
to
pay
back
gardley
for
his
part
in
her
humiliation
with
forsythe
she
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
great
thing
if
gardley
could
be
prevented
from
being
at
the
play
tuesday
evening
and
told
what
she
had
overheard
him
saying
to
her
father
merely
to
show
forsythe
how
easy
it
would
be
to
have
gardley
detained
on
tuesday
forsythe
questioned
rosa
keenly
did
she
know
whom
they
suspected
did
she
know
what
they
were
planning
to
do
to
catch
them
and
when
rosa
innocently
enough
disclosed
all
she
knew
little
thinking
how
dishonorable
to
her
father
it
was
and
perhaps
caring
as
little
for
rosa
had
ever
been
a
spoiled
child
accustomed
to
subordinating
everything
within
reach
to
her
own
uses
as
for
forsythe
he
was
nothing
loath
to
get
rid
of
gardley
and
he
saw
more
possibilities
in
suggestion
than
she
had
seen
herself
when
at
last
he
bade
rosa
good
night
and
rode
unobtrusively
back
to
the
trail
he
was
already
formulating
a
plan
it
was
therefore
quite
in
keeping
with
his
wishes
that
he
should
meet
a
rider
a
few
miles
farther
up
the
trail
whose
identity
he
had
happened
to
learn
a
few
days
before
now
forsythe
would
perhaps
not
have
dared
to
enter
into
any
compact
against
gardley
with
men
of
such
had
it
been
a
matter
of
money
and
bribery
but
armed
as
he
was
with
information
valuable
to
the
criminals
he
could
so
word
his
suggestion
about
gardley
detention
as
to
make
the
hunted
men
think
it
to
their
advantage
to
catch
gardley
some
time
the
next
day
when
he
passed
their
way
and
imprison
him
for
a
while
this
would
appear
to
be
but
a
friendly
bit
of
advice
from
a
disinterested
party
deserving
a
good
turn
some
time
in
the
future
and
not
get
forsythe
into
any
trouble
as
such
it
was
received
by
the
wretch
who
clutched
at
the
information
with
delight
and
rode
away
into
the
twilight
like
a
serpent
threading
his
secret
gliding
way
among
the
darkest
places
scarcely
rippling
the
air
so
stealthily
did
he
pass
as
for
forsythe
he
rode
blithely
to
the
temple
ranch
with
no
thought
of
the
forces
he
had
set
going
his
life
as
yet
one
round
of
trying
to
please
himself
at
others
expense
if
need
be
but
please
himself
with
whatever
amusement
the
hour
afforded
at
home
in
the
east
where
his
early
life
had
been
spent
a
splendid
girl
awaited
his
dilatory
letters
and
set
herself
patiently
to
endure
the
months
of
separation
until
he
should
have
attained
a
home
and
a
living
and
be
ready
for
her
to
come
to
him
in
the
south
where
he
had
idled
six
months
before
he
went
west
another
lovely
girl
cherished
mementoes
of
his
tarrying
and
wrote
him
loving
letters
in
reply
to
his
occasional
erratic
epistles
out
on
the
californian
shore
a
girl
with
whom
he
had
traveled
west
in
her
uncle
luxurious
private
car
with
a
gay
party
of
friends
and
relatives
cherished
fond
hopes
of
a
visit
he
had
promised
to
make
her
during
the
winter
innumerable
maidens
of
this
world
wise
in
the
wisdom
that
crushes
hearts
remembered
him
with
a
sigh
now
and
then
but
held
no
illusions
concerning
his
kind
pretty
little
rosa
rogers
cried
her
eyes
out
every
time
he
cast
a
languishing
look
at
her
teacher
and
several
of
the
ladies
of
the
fort
sighed
that
the
glance
of
his
eye
and
the
gentle
pressure
of
his
hand
could
only
be
a
passing
joy
but
the
gay
lothario
passed
on
his
way
as
yet
without
a
scratch
on
the
hard
enamel
of
his
heart
till
one
wondered
if
it
were
a
heart
indeed
or
perhaps
only
a
metal
imitation
but
girls
like
margaret
earle
though
they
sometimes
were
attracted
by
him
invariably
distrusted
him
he
was
like
a
beautiful
spotted
snake
that
was
often
caught
menacing
something
precious
but
you
could
put
him
down
anywhere
after
punishment
or
imprisonment
and
he
would
slide
on
his
same
slippery
way
and
still
be
a
spotted
deadly
snake
when
gardley
left
the
camp
that
monday
morning
following
the
walk
home
with
margaret
from
the
sabbath
service
he
fully
intended
to
be
back
at
the
monday
by
the
time
the
afternoon
rehearsal
began
his
plans
were
so
laid
that
he
thought
relays
from
other
camps
were
to
guard
the
suspected
ground
for
the
next
three
days
and
he
could
be
free
it
had
been
a
part
of
the
information
that
forsythe
had
given
the
stranger
that
gardley
would
likely
pass
a
certain
lonely
crossing
of
the
trail
at
about
three
that
afternoon
and
had
that
arrangement
been
carried
out
the
men
who
lay
in
wait
for
him
would
doubtless
have
been
pleased
to
have
their
plans
mature
so
easily
but
they
would
not
have
been
pleased
long
for
gardley
men
were
so
near
at
hand
at
that
time
watching
that
very
spot
with
eyes
and
ears
and
glasses
that
their
chief
would
soon
have
been
rescued
and
the
captors
be
themselves
the
captured
but
the
men
from
the
farther
camp
called
lone
fox
men
did
not
arrive
on
time
perhaps
through
some
misunderstanding
and
gardley
and
kemp
and
their
men
had
to
do
double
time
at
last
later
in
the
afternoon
gardley
volunteered
to
go
to
lone
fox
and
bring
back
the
men
as
he
rode
his
thoughts
were
of
margaret
and
he
was
seeing
again
the
look
of
gladness
in
her
eyes
when
she
found
he
had
not
gone
yesterday
feeling
again
the
thrill
of
her
hands
in
his
the
trust
of
her
smile
it
was
incredible
wonderful
that
god
had
sent
a
veritable
angel
into
the
wilderness
to
bring
him
to
himself
and
now
he
was
wondering
could
it
be
that
there
was
really
hope
that
he
could
ever
make
good
enough
to
dare
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
the
sky
and
the
air
were
rare
but
his
thoughts
were
rarer
still
and
his
soul
was
lifted
up
with
joy
he
was
earning
good
wages
now
in
two
more
weeks
he
would
have
enough
to
pay
back
the
paltry
sum
for
the
lack
of
which
he
had
fled
from
his
old
home
and
come
to
the
wilderness
he
would
go
back
of
course
and
straighten
out
the
old
score
then
what
should
he
stay
in
the
east
and
go
back
to
the
old
business
wherewith
he
had
hoped
to
make
his
name
honored
and
gain
wealth
or
should
he
return
to
this
wild
free
land
again
and
start
anew
his
mother
was
dead
perhaps
if
she
had
lived
and
cared
he
would
have
made
good
in
the
first
place
his
sisters
were
both
married
to
wealthy
men
and
not
deeply
interested
in
him
he
had
disappointed
and
mortified
them
their
lives
were
filled
with
social
duties
they
had
never
missed
him
his
father
had
been
dead
many
years
as
for
his
uncle
his
brother
whose
heir
he
was
to
have
been
before
he
got
himself
into
disgrace
he
decided
not
to
go
near
him
he
would
stay
as
long
as
he
must
to
undo
the
wrong
he
had
done
he
would
call
on
his
sisters
and
then
come
back
come
back
and
let
margaret
decide
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
that
is
if
she
would
consent
to
link
her
life
with
one
who
had
been
once
a
failure
margaret
how
wonderful
she
was
if
margaret
said
he
ought
to
go
back
and
be
a
lawyer
he
would
go
yes
even
if
he
had
to
enter
his
uncle
office
as
an
underling
to
do
it
his
soul
loathed
the
idea
but
he
would
do
it
for
margaret
if
she
thought
it
best
and
so
he
mused
as
he
rode
when
the
lone
fox
camp
was
reached
and
the
men
sent
out
on
their
belated
task
gardley
decided
not
to
go
with
them
back
to
meet
kemp
and
the
other
men
but
sent
word
to
kemp
that
he
had
gone
the
short
cut
to
ashland
hoping
to
get
to
a
part
of
the
evening
rehearsal
yet
now
that
short
cut
led
him
to
the
lonely
crossing
of
the
trail
much
sooner
than
kemp
and
the
others
could
reach
it
from
the
rendezvous
and
there
in
cramped
positions
and
with
much
unnecessary
cursing
and
impatience
four
strong
masked
men
had
been
concealed
for
four
long
hours
through
the
stillness
of
the
twilight
rode
gardley
thinking
of
margaret
and
for
once
utterly
off
his
guard
his
long
day
work
was
done
and
though
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
back
when
he
planned
he
was
free
now
free
until
the
day
after
he
would
go
at
once
to
her
and
see
if
there
was
anything
she
wanted
him
to
do
then
as
if
to
help
along
his
enemies
he
began
to
hum
a
song
his
clear
high
voice
reaching
keenly
to
the
ears
of
the
men
in
ambush
the
time
is

o

said
an
unmistakable
voice
of
erin
through
the
gathering
dusk
gardley
horse
stopped
and
gardley
hand
went
to
his
revolver
while
his
other
hand
lifted
the
silver
whistle
to
his
lips
but
four
guns
bristled
at
him
in
the
twilight
the
whistle
was
knocked
from
his
lips
before
his
breath
had
even
reached
it
some
one
caught
his
arms
from
behind
and
his
own
weapon
was
wrenched
from
his
hand
as
it
went
off
the
cry
which
he
at
once
sent
forth
was
stifled
in
its
first
whisper
in
a
great
muffling
garment
flung
over
his
head
and
drawn
tightly
about
his
neck
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
strangle
and
his
vigorous
efforts
at
escape
were
useless
in
the
hands
of
so
many
he
might
have
been
plunged
at
once
into
a
great
abyss
of
limitless
soundless
depths
so
futile
did
any
resistance
seem
and
so
as
it
was
useless
to
struggle
he
lay
like
one
dead
and
put
all
his
powers
into
listening
but
neither
could
he
hear
much
muffled
as
he
was
and
bound
hand
and
foot
now
with
a
gag
in
his
mouth
and
little
care
taken
whether
he
could
even
breathe
they
were
leading
him
off
the
trail
and
up
over
rough
ground
so
much
he
knew
for
the
horse
stumbled
and
jolted
and
strained
to
carry
him
to
keep
his
whirling
senses
alive
and
alert
he
tried
to
think
where
they
might
be
leading
him
but
the
darkness
and
the
suffocation
dulled
his
powers
he
wondered
idly
if
his
men
would
miss
him
and
come
back
when
they
got
home
to
search
for
him
and
then
remembered
with
a
pang
that
they
would
think
him
safely
in
ashland
helping
margaret
they
would
not
be
alarmed
if
he
did
not
return
that
night
for
they
would
suppose
he
had
stopped
at
rogers
on
the
way
and
perhaps
stayed
all
night
as
he
had
done
once
or
twice
before
when
should
he
see
margaret
now
what
would
she
think
and
then
he
swooned
away
when
he
came
somewhat
to
himself
he
was
in
a
close
stifling
room
where
from
a
distance
threw
weird
shadows
over
the
adobe
walls
the
voices
of
a
woman
and
a
girl
in
harsh
cackling
laughter
half
suppressed
were
not
far
away
and
some
one
whose
face
was
covered
was
holding
a
glass
to
his
lips
the
smell
was
sickening
and
he
remembered
that
he
hated
the
thought
of
liquor
it
did
not
fit
with
those
who
companied
with
margaret
he
had
never
cared
for
it
and
had
resolved
never
to
taste
it
again
but
whether
he
chose
or
not
the
liquor
was
poured
down
his
throat
huge
hands
held
him
and
forced
it
and
he
was
still
bound
and
too
weak
to
resist
even
if
he
had
realized
the
necessity
the
liquid
burned
its
way
down
his
throat
and
seethed
into
his
brain
and
a
great
darkness
mingled
with
men
wrangling
voices
and
much
cursing
swirled
about
him
like
some
furious
torrent
of
angry
waters
that
finally
submerged
his
consciousness
then
came
deeper
darkness
and
a
blank
relief
from
pain
hours
passed
he
heard
sounds
sometimes
and
dreamed
dreams
which
he
could
not
tell
from
reality
he
saw
his
friends
with
terror
written
on
their
faces
while
he
lay
apathetically
and
could
not
stir
he
saw
tears
on
margaret
face
and
once
he
was
sure
he
heard
forsythe
voice
in
contempt
well
he
seems
to
be
well
occupied
for
the
present
no
danger
of
his
waking
up
for
a
while
and
then
the
voices
all
grew
dim
and
far
away
again
and
only
an
old
crone
and
the
harsh
girl
whisper
over
him
and
then
margaret
tears
tears
that
fell
on
his
heart
from
far
above
and
seemed
to
melt
out
all
his
early
sins
and
flood
him
with
their
horror
tears
and
the
consciousness
that
he
ought
to
be
doing
something
for
margaret
now
and
could
not
tears
and
more
darkness
chapter
xxv
when
margaret
arrived
behind
the
curtain
she
was
aware
of
many
cries
and
questions
hurled
at
her
like
an
avalanche
but
ignoring
them
all
she
sprang
past
the
noisy
excited
group
of
young
people
darted
through
the
to
the
right
and
out
into
the
night
and
coolness
her
head
was
swimming
and
things
went
black
before
her
eyes
she
felt
that
her
breath
was
going
going
and
she
must
get
to
the
air
but
when
she
passed
the
hot
wave
of
the
and
the
sharp
air
of
the
night
struck
her
face
consciousness
seemed
to
turn
and
come
back
into
her
again
for
there
over
her
head
was
the
wideness
of
the
vast
starry
arizona
night
and
there
before
her
in
nick
bottom
somber
costume
eating
one
of
the
chicken
sandwiches
that
tanner
had
sent
down
to
her
stood
gardley
he
was
pale
and
shaken
from
his
recent
experience
but
he
was
undaunted
and
when
he
saw
margaret
coming
toward
him
through
the
doorway
with
her
soul
in
her
eyes
and
her
spirit
all
aflame
with
joy
and
relief
he
came
to
meet
her
under
the
stars
and
forgetting
everything
else
just
folded
her
gently
in
his
arms
it
was
a
most
astonishing
thing
to
do
of
course
right
there
outside
the
door
with
the
curtain
just
about
to
rise
on
the
scene
and
gardley
wig
was
not
on
yet
he
had
not
even
asked
nor
obtained
permission
but
the
soul
sometimes
grows
impatient
waiting
for
the
lips
to
speak
and
margaret
felt
her
trust
had
been
justified
and
her
heart
had
found
its
home
right
there
behind
the
out
in
the
great
wide
night
while
the
crowded
clamoring
audience
waited
for
them
and
the
young
actors
grew
frantic
they
plighted
their
troth
his
lips
upon
hers
and
with
not
a
word
spoken
voices
from
the
roused
them
come
in
quick
gardley
it
time
for
the
curtain
to
rise
and
everybody
is
ready
where
on
earth
has
miss
earle
vanished
miss
earle
oh
miss
earle
there
was
a
rush
to
the
to
find
the
missing
ones
but
bud
as
ever
present
where
was
the
most
need
stood
with
his
back
to
the
outside
world
in
the
door
of
the
and
called
loudly
they
comin
all
right
go
on
get
to
your
places
miss
earle
says
to
get
to
your
places
the
two
in
the
darkness
groped
for
each
other
hands
as
they
stood
suddenly
apart
and
with
one
quick
pressure
and
a
glance
hurried
in
there
was
not
any
need
for
words
they
understood
these
two
and
trusted
with
her
cheeks
glowing
now
and
her
eyes
like
two
stars
margaret
fled
across
the
stage
and
took
her
place
at
the
piano
again
just
as
the
curtain
began
to
be
drawn
and
forsythe
who
had
been
slightly
uneasy
at
the
look
on
her
face
as
she
left
them
wondered
now
and
leaned
forward
to
tell
her
how
well
she
was
looking
he
kept
his
honeyed
phrase
to
himself
however
for
she
was
not
heeding
him
her
eyes
were
on
the
rising
curtain
and
forsythe
suddenly
remembered
that
this
was
the
scene
in
which
jed
was
to
have
appeared
and
jed
had
a
broken
leg
what
had
margaret
done
about
it
it
was
scarcely
a
part
that
could
be
left
out
why
had
he
thought
of
it
sooner
and
offered
to
take
it
he
could
have
bluffed
it
out
somehow
he
had
heard
it
so
much
made
up
words
where
he
could
remember
them
all
and
it
would
have
been
a
splendid
opportunity
to
do
some
real
with
rosa
why
had
he
thought
of
it
why
had
rosa
perhaps
she
had
heard
about
jed
soon
enough
to
suggest
it
the
curtain
was
fully
open
now
and
bud
voice
as
peter
quince
a
trifle
high
and
cracked
with
excitement
broke
the
stillness
while
the
awed
audience
gazed
upon
this
new
strange
world
presented
to
them
is
all
our
company
here
lilted
out
bud
excitedly
and
nick
bottom
replied
with
gardley
voice
you
were
best
to
call
them
generally
man
by
man
according
to
the
scrip
forsythe
turned
deadly
white
jasper
kemp
whose
keen
eye
was
upon
him
saw
it
through
the
tan
saw
his
lips
go
pale
and
purple
points
of
fear
start
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
and
looked
again
and
could
not
believe
his
senses
furtively
he
darted
a
glance
around
like
one
about
to
steal
away
then
seeing
jasper
kemp
eyes
upon
him
settled
back
with
a
strained
look
upon
his
face
once
he
stole
a
look
at
margaret
and
caught
her
face
all
transfigured
with
great
joy
looked
again
and
felt
rebuked
somehow
by
the
pureness
of
her
maiden
joy
and
trust
not
once
had
she
turned
her
eyes
to
his
he
was
forgotten
and
somehow
he
knew
the
look
he
would
get
if
she
should
see
him
it
would
be
contempt
and
scorn
that
would
burn
his
very
soul
it
is
only
a
maid
now
and
then
to
whom
it
is
given
thus
to
pierce
and
bruise
the
soul
of
a
man
who
plays
with
love
and
trust
and
womanhood
for
selfishness
such
a
woman
never
knows
her
power
she
punishes
all
unconscious
to
herself
it
was
so
that
margaret
earle
without
being
herself
aware
and
by
her
very
indifference
and
contempt
showed
the
little
soul
of
this
puppet
man
to
himself
he
stole
away
at
last
when
he
thought
no
one
was
looking
and
reached
the
back
of
the
at
the
open
door
of
the
where
he
knew
titania
would
be
posing
in
between
the
acts
he
beckoned
her
to
his
side
and
began
to
question
her
in
quick
eager
almost
angry
tones
as
if
the
failure
of
their
plans
were
her
fault
had
her
father
been
at
home
all
day
had
anything
happened
any
one
been
there
did
gardley
come
had
there
been
any
report
from
the
men
had
that
short
scotchman
with
the
ugly
grin
been
there
she
must
remember
that
she
was
the
one
to
suggest
the
scheme
in
the
first
place
and
it
was
her
business
to
keep
a
watch
there
was
no
telling
now
what
might
happen
he
turned
and
there
stood
jasper
kemp
close
to
his
elbow
his
short
stature
drawn
to
its
full
his
shoulders
squaring
themselves
his
ugly
grin
standing
out
in
bold
relief
menacingly
in
the
night
the
young
man
let
forth
some
words
not
in
a
gentleman
code
and
turned
to
leave
the
frightened
girl
who
by
this
time
was
almost
crying
but
jasper
kemp
kept
pace
with
forsythe
as
he
walked
was
you
addressing
me
he
asked
politely
because
i
could
tell
you
a
few
things
a
sight
more
appropriate
for
you
than
what
you
just
handed
to
me
forsythe
hurried
around
to
the
front
of
the
making
no
reply
nice
pleasant
evening
to
be
went
on
jasper
kemp
looking
up
at
the
stars
rather
onpleasant
for
some
folks
that
have
to
be
shut
up
in
jail
forsythe
wheeled
upon
him
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
angrily
albeit
he
was
white
with
fear
oh
nothing
much
drawled
jasper
affably
i
was
just
thinking
how
much
pleasanter
it
was
to
be
a
free
man
than
shut
up
in
prison
on
a
night
like
this
it
so
much
healthier
you
know
forsythe
looked
at
him
a
moment
a
kind
of
panic
of
intelligence
growing
in
his
face
then
he
turned
and
went
toward
the
back
of
the
where
he
had
left
his
horse
some
hours
before
where
are
you
going
demanded
jasper
it
time
you
went
back
to
your
fiddling
ai
it
but
forsythe
answered
him
not
a
word
he
was
mounting
his
horse
hurriedly
his
horse
which
all
unknown
to
him
had
been
many
miles
since
he
last
rode
him
you
think
you
have
to
go
then
said
jasper
deprecatingly
well
now
that
a
pity
seeing
you
was
fiddling
so
nice
an
all
shall
i
tell
them
you
gone
for
your
health
thus
recalled
forsythe
stared
at
his
tormentor
wildly
for
a
second
tell
her
tell
her
he
muttered
hoarsely
tell
her
i
been
taken
suddenly
and
he
was
off
on
a
wild
gallop
toward
the
fort
i
tell
her
you
gone
for
your
health
called
jasper
kemp
with
his
hands
to
his
mouth
like
a
megaphone
i
reckon
he
wo
return
again
very
soon
either
he
chuckled
this
country
better
off
without
such
pests
as
him
an
that
measley
parson
then
turning
he
beheld
titania
the
queen
of
the
fairies
white
and
frightened
staring
wildly
into
the
starry
darkness
after
the
departed
rider
poor
little
fool
he
muttered
under
his
breath
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
and
turned
away
poor
pretty
little
fool
suddenly
he
stepped
up
to
her
side
and
touched
her
shoulder
gently
do
you
go
for
to
care
lassie
he
said
in
a
tender
tone
he
ai
worth
a
tear
from
your
pretty
eye
he
ai
fit
to
wipe
your
feet
on
your
pretty
wee
feet
but
rosa
turned
angrily
and
stamped
her
foot
go
away
you
bad
old
man
she
shrieked
go
away
i
shall
tell
my
father
and
she
flouted
herself
into
the
jasper
stood
looking
ruefully
after
her
shaking
his
head
the
little
he
said
aloud
the
poor
pretty
little
she
get
her
dues
aplenty
afore
she
done
and
jasper
went
back
to
the
play
meantime
inside
the
the
play
went
gloriously
on
to
the
finish
and
gardley
as
nick
bottom
took
the
house
by
storm
poor
absent
jed
father
sent
by
the
sufferer
to
report
it
all
stood
at
the
back
of
the
house
while
tears
of
pride
and
disappointment
rolled
down
his
cheeks
pride
that
jed
had
been
so
well
represented
disappointment
that
it
could
have
been
his
son
up
there
like
that
the
hour
was
late
when
the
play
was
over
and
margaret
stood
at
last
in
front
of
the
stage
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
the
entire
countryside
while
the
young
actors
posed
and
laughed
and
chattered
excitedly
then
went
away
by
two
and
threes
their
tired
happy
voices
sounding
back
along
the
road
the
people
from
the
fort
had
been
the
first
to
surge
around
margaret
with
their
eager
congratulations
and
gushing
sentiments
so
sweet
my
dear
so
perfectly
wonderful
you
really
have
got
some
dandy
actors
and
why
do
you
try
something
lighter
something
simpler
do
you
know
something
really
popular
that
these
poor
people
could
understand
and
appreciate
a
little
farce
i
could
help
you
pick
one
out
and
all
the
while
they
gushed
jasper
kemp
and
his
men
grim
and
forbidding
stood
like
a
cordon
drawn
about
her
to
protect
her
with
gardley
in
the
center
just
behind
her
as
though
he
had
a
right
there
and
meant
to
stay
till
at
last
the
fort
people
hurried
away
and
the
grew
suddenly
empty
with
just
those
two
and
the
eight
men
behind
and
by
the
door
bud
talking
to
pop
and
mom
wallis
in
the
buckboard
outside
amid
this
admiring
bodyguard
at
last
gardley
took
margaret
home
perhaps
she
wondered
a
little
that
they
all
went
along
but
she
laid
it
to
their
pride
in
the
play
and
their
desire
to
talk
it
over
they
had
sent
mom
and
pop
wallis
home
horseback
after
all
and
put
margaret
and
gardley
in
the
buckboard
margaret
never
dreaming
that
it
was
because
gardley
was
not
fit
to
walk
indeed
he
did
not
realize
himself
why
they
all
stuck
so
closely
to
him
he
had
lived
through
so
much
since
jasper
and
his
men
had
burst
into
his
prison
and
freed
him
bringing
him
in
hot
haste
to
the
with
bud
wildly
riding
ahead
but
it
was
enough
for
him
to
sit
beside
margaret
in
the
sweet
night
and
remember
how
she
had
come
out
to
him
under
the
stars
her
hand
lay
beside
him
on
the
seat
and
without
intending
it
his
own
brushed
it
then
he
laid
his
gently
reverently
down
upon
hers
with
a
quiet
pressure
and
her
smaller
fingers
thrilled
and
nestled
in
his
grasp
in
the
shadow
of
a
big
tree
beside
the
house
he
bade
her
the
men
busying
themselves
with
turning
about
the
buckboard
noisily
and
bud
discreetly
taking
himself
to
the
back
door
to
get
one
of
the
men
a
drink
of
water
you
have
been
suffering
in
some
way
said
margaret
with
sudden
intuition
as
she
looked
up
into
gardley
face
you
have
been
in
peril
somehow
a
little
he
answered
lightly
i
tell
you
about
it
i
must
keep
the
men
waiting
now
i
shall
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
if
you
will
let
me
good
night
their
hands
lingered
in
a
clasp
and
then
he
rode
away
with
his
bodyguard
but
margaret
did
not
have
to
wait
until
the
morrow
to
hear
the
story
for
bud
was
just
fairly
bursting
tanner
had
prepared
a
nice
little
supper
more
cold
chicken
pie
doughnuts
coffee
some
of
her
famous
marble
cake
and
preserves
and
she
insisted
on
margaret
coming
into
the
and
eating
it
though
the
girl
would
much
rather
have
gone
with
her
happy
heart
up
to
her
own
room
by
herself
bud
did
not
wait
on
ceremony
he
began
at
once
when
margaret
was
seated
even
before
his
mother
could
get
her
properly

on
well
we
had

i
had
to
take
it

a
dead
cinch
but

for
the
men
and
then
taking
the
short
trail
across
it

almost
reduced
to
tears
she
saw
her
offspring
at
the
edge
of
perdition
at
once
but
bud
ignored
his
mother
and
went
on
with
his
tale

and
they
all
hustled
on
their
horses
fast
as
ever
they
could
and
beat
it
after
jap
kemp
jap
he
rode
alongside
o
me
and
asked
me
questions
he
made
me
tell
all
what
the
guy
from
the
fort
said
over
again
three
or
four
times
and
then
he
ast
what
time
he
got
to
the
and
whether
the
kid
had
been
there
at
all
ur
and
a
lot
of
other
questions
and
then
he
rode
alongside
each
man
and
told
him
in
just
a
few
words
where
we
was
goin
and
what
the
guy
from
the

to
the
woods
round

cabin
and
jap
kemp
made
me
stick
alongside
long
bill
and
he
sent
the
men
off
in
different
directions
all
in
a
circle
and
waited
till
each
man
was
in
his
place
and
then
we
all
rode
hard
as
we
could
and
came
softly
up
round
that
cabin
just
as
the
sun
was
goin
down

of
the
men
was
sick
on
a
bunk
in
the
corner
he
had
his
head
tied
up
and
his
arm
like

been
shot
and
the
other
two

with
their
guns

how
many
men
had
they
looked
awful
scairt

but
it
was
almost
too

for

two
of
our
men
held
the
horses
and
all
the

kind
of
signals
they
have
for
the
lone
fox
camp
the
two
men
in
the
doorway
aimed
straight
at
jap
kemp
and
fired
but
jap

onto
and
jumped
one
side
and
our

and
some
more
of
men

most
twenty
or
thirty
there
was
i
guess
altogether
some
from
lone
fox
camp
that
was
watching
off
in
the
woods
came
and
when
we
got
outside
again
there
they
all
were
like
a
big
army
most
of
the
men
belonging
to
the
cabin
was
tied
and
harmless
by
that
time
for
our
men
took
one
at
a
time
as
they
came
riding
in
two
of
got
away
but
jap
kemp
said
they
could
go
far
without
being
caught
there
was
a
watch
out
for
they
been
stealing
cattle
long
back
something
terrible
well
so
jap
kemp
and
long
bill
and
i
went
into
the
cabin
after
the
two
men
that
shot
was
tied
with
ropes
we
brung
along
and
handcuffs
and
we
went
hunting
for
the
kid
at
first
we
could
find
him
at
all
gee
it
was
something
fierce
and
the
old
woman
and
saying
we
kill
her
sick
son
and
she
did
know
nothing
about
the
man
we
was
hunting
for
but
pretty
soon
i
spied
the
kid
foot
stickin
out
from
under
the
cot
where
the
sick
man
was
and
when
i
told
jap
kemp
that
sick
man
pulled
out
a
gun
he
had
under
the
blanket
and
aimed
it
right
at
me
oh
mother
little
buddie
whimpered
tanner
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
cut
it
out
did
me
the
gun
just
went
off
crooked
and
grazed
jap
kemp
hand
a
little
not
much
jap
knocked
it
out
of
the
sick
man
hand
just
as
he
was
pullin
the
trigger
say
ma
ai
you
got
any
more
of
those
cucumber
pickles
it
makes
a
man
mighty
hungry
to
do
all
that
riding
and
shooting
well
it
certainly
was
something
fierce
say
miss
earle
you
take
that
last
piece
o
pie
oh
it
worked
hard
no
i
do
want
it
really
well
if
you
wo
take
it
i
might
eat
it
just
to
save
it
got
any
more
coffee
ma
but
margaret
was
not
eating
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
were
starry
with
unshed
tears
and
she
waited
in
patient
but
breathless
suspense
for
the
vagaries
of
the
story
to
work
out
to
the
finish
yes
it
certainly
was
something
fierce
that
cabin
went
on
the
narrator
why
ma
it
looked
as
if
it
had
never
been
swept
under
that
cot
when
we
hauled
the
kid
out
he
was
tied
all
up
in
knots
and
great
heavy
ropes
wound
tight
from
his
shoulders
down
to
his
ankles
why
they
were
bound
so
tight
they
made
great
heavy
welts
in
his
wrists
and
shoulders
and
round
his
ankles
when
we
took
off
and
they
had
a
great
big
rag
stuffed
into
his
mouth
so
he
could
yell
gee
it
was
something
fierce
he
was
dippy
too
but
jap
kemp
brought
him
round
pretty
quick
and
got
him
outside
in
the
air
that
was
the
worst
place
i
ever
was
in
myself
you
could
breathe
and
the
dirt
was
something
fierce
it
was
like
a
pigpen
i
sure
was
glad
to
get
outdoors
again
and
then
well
the
kid
came
around
all
right
and
they
got
him
on
a
horse
and
gave
him
something
out
of
a
bottle
jap
kemp
had
and
pretty
soon
he
could
ride
again
why
you
oughta
seen
his
nerve
he
just
sat
up
there
as
straight
his
lips
all
white
yet
and
his
eyes
looked
some
queer
but
he
straightened
up
and
he
looked
those
rascals
right
in
the
eye
and
told
a
few
things
and
he
gave
orders
to
the
other
men
from
lone
fox
camp
what
to
do
with
and
he
had
the
two
women
disarmed
they
had
guns
too
and
carried
away
and
the
cabin
nailed
up
and
a
notice
put
on
the
door
and
every
one
of
those
men
were
handcuffed
the
sick
one
and
all
and
he
told
to
bring
a
wagon
and
put
the
sick
one
cot
in
and
take
over
to
ashland
to
the
jail
and
he
sent
word
to
rogers
then
we
rode
home
and
got
to
the
just
when
you
was
playing
the
last
chords
of
the
gee
it
was
some
fierce
ride
and
some
the
kid
he
had
a
thing
to
eat
since
monday
noon
and
he
was
some
hungry
i
found
a
sandwich
on
the
window
of
the
and
he
ate
it
while
he
got
togged
up
i
told
him
jed
soon
we
left
the
cabin
and
jap
kemp
said
he
oughta
go
right
home
to
camp
after
all
he
had
been
through
but
he
would
he
said
he
was
goin
to
so
he
had
his
way
but
gee
you
could
see
it
was
any
cinch
game
for
him
he
fell
over
every
time
after
the
curtain
fell
you
see
they
gave
him
some
kind
of
drugged
whisky
up
there
at
the
cabin
that
made
his
head
feel
queer
say
he
thinks
that
guy
from
the
fort
came
in
and
looked
at
him
once
while
he
was
asleep
he
says
it
was
only
a
dream
but
i
bet
he
did
say
ma
ai
you
gonta
give
me
another
doughnut
in
the
quiet
of
her
chamber
at
last
margaret
knelt
before
her
window
toward
the
purple
shadowy
mountain
under
the
starry
dome
and
gave
thanks
for
the
deliverance
of
gardley
while
bud
in
his
comfortable
loft
lay
down
to
his
rest
and
dreamed
of
pirates
and
angels
and
a
hero
who
looked
like
the
kid
chapter
xxvi
the
sunday
before
lance
gardley
started
east
on
his
journey
of
reparation
two
strangers
slipped
quietly
into
the
back
of
the
during
the
singing
of
the
first
hymn
and
sat
down
in
the
shadow
by
the
door
margaret
was
playing
the
piano
when
they
came
in
and
did
not
see
them
and
when
she
turned
back
to
her
scripture
lesson
she
had
time
for
but
the
briefest
of
glances
she
supposed
they
must
be
some
visitors
from
the
fort
as
they
were
speaking
to
the
captain
wife
who
came
over
occasionally
to
the
sunday
service
perhaps
because
it
afforded
an
opportunity
for
a
ride
with
one
of
the
young
officers
these
occasional
visitors
who
came
for
amusement
and
curiosity
had
ceased
to
trouble
margaret
her
real
work
was
with
the
men
and
women
and
children
who
loved
the
services
for
their
own
sake
and
she
tried
as
much
as
possible
to
forget
outsiders
so
that
day
everything
went
on
just
as
usual
margaret
putting
her
heart
into
the
prayer
the
simple
storylike
reading
of
the
scripture
and
the
other
which
followed
it
gardley
sang
unusually
well
at
the
close
a
wonderful
bit
from
an
oratorio
that
he
and
margaret
had
been
practising
but
when
toward
the
close
of
the
little
vesper
service
margaret
gave
opportunity
as
she
often
did
for
others
to
take
part
in
sentence
prayers
one
of
the
strangers
from
the
back
of
the
room
stood
up
and
began
to
pray
and
such
a
prayer
heaven
seemed
to
bend
low
and
earth
to
kneel
and
beseech
as
the
with
a
face
like
an
archangel
and
a
body
of
an
athlete
clothed
in
a
shirt
and
khakis
besought
the
lord
of
heaven
for
a
blessing
on
this
gathering
and
on
the
leader
of
this
little
company
who
had
so
wonderfully
led
them
to
see
the
christ
and
their
need
of
salvation
through
the
lesson
of
the
day
and
it
did
not
need
bud
whisper
the
missionary
to
tell
margaret
who
he
was
his
face
told
her
his
prayer
thrilled
her
and
his
strong
young
true
voice
made
her
sure
that
here
was
a
man
of
god
in
truth
when
the
prayer
was
over
and
margaret
stood
once
more
shyly
facing
her
audience
she
could
scarcely
keep
the
tremble
out
of
her
voice
oh
said
she
casting
aside
ceremony
if
i
had
known
the
missionary
was
here
i
should
not
have
dared
to
try
and
lead
this
meeting
wo
you
please
come
up
here
and
talk
to
us
for
a
little
while
now
mr
brownleigh
at
once
he
came
forward
eagerly
as
if
each
opportunity
were
a
pleasure
why
surely
i
want
to
speak
a
word
to
you
just
to
say
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
all
and
to
experience
what
a
wonderful
teacher
you
have
found
since
i
went
away
but
i
would
have
missed
this
meeting
for
all
the
sermons
i
ever
wrote
or
preached
you
do
need
any
more
sermon
than
the
remarkable
story
you
just
been
listening
to
and
only
one
word
to
add
and
that
is
that
i
found
since
i
went
away
that
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
is
just
the
same
jesus
to
me
that
he
was
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
you
he
is
just
as
ready
to
forgive
your
sin
to
comfort
you
in
sorrow
to
help
you
in
temptation
to
raise
your
body
in
the
resurrection
and
to
take
you
home
to
a
mansion
in
his
father
house
as
he
was
the
day
he
hung
upon
the
cross
to
save
your
soul
from
death
i
found
i
can
rest
just
as
securely
upon
the
bible
as
the
word
of
god
as
when
i
first
tested
its
promises
heaven
and
earth
may
pass
away
but
his
word
shall
pass
away
to
it
said
jasper
kemp
under
his
breath
in
the
tone
some
men
say
amen
and
his
brows
were
drawn
as
if
he
were
watching
a
battle
margaret
could
help
wondering
if
he
were
thinking
of
the
rev
frederick
west
just
then
when
the
service
was
over
the
missionary
brought
his
wife
forward
to
margaret
and
they
loved
each
other
at
once
just
another
sweet
girl
like
margaret
she
was
lovely
with
a
delicacy
of
feature
that
betokened
the
and
but
dressed
in
a
dainty
khaki
riding
costume
if
that
uncompromising
fabric
could
ever
be
called
dainty
margaret
remembering
it
afterward
wondered
what
it
had
been
that
gave
it
that
unique
individuality
and
decided
it
was
perhaps
a
combination
of
cut
and
finish
and
little
dainty
accessories
a
bit
of
creamy
lace
at
the
throat
of
the
rolling
collar
a
touch
of
velvet
in
a
golden
clasp
the
flash
of
a
wonderful
jewel
on
her
finger
the
modeling
of
the
small
brown
cap
with
its
two
eagle
quills
all
set
the
little
woman
apart
and
made
her
fit
to
enter
any
company
of
riders
in
some
great
city
park
or
fashionable
drive
yet
here
in
the
wilderness
she
was
not
overdressed
the
eight
men
from
the
camp
stood
in
solemn
row
waiting
to
be
recognized
and
behind
them
abashed
and
grinning
with
embarrassment
stood
pop
and
mom
wallis
mom
with
her
new
gray
bonnet
glorifying
her
old
face
till
the
missionary
wife
had
to
look
twice
to
be
sure
who
she
was
and
now
surely
hazel
we
must
have
these
dear
people
come
over
and
help
us
with
the
singing
sometimes
ca
we
try
something
right
now
said
the
missionary
looking
first
at
his
wife
and
then
at
margaret
and
gardley
this
man
is
a
since
i
went
away
but
i
mighty
sure
he
is
the
right
kind
and
i
glad
to
welcome
him
or
perhaps
i
would
better
ask
if
he
will
welcome
me
and
with
his
rare
smile
the
missionary
put
out
his
hand
to
gardley
who
took
it
with
an
eager
grasp
the
two
men
stood
looking
at
each
other
for
a
moment
as
rare
men
rarely
met
sometimes
do
even
on
a
sinful
earth
and
after
that
clasp
and
that
look
they
turned
away
brothers
for
life
that
was
a
most
interesting
song
rehearsal
that
followed
it
would
be
rare
to
find
four
voices
like
those
even
in
a
cultivated
musical
center
and
they
blended
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
one
another
the
men
from
the
and
a
lot
of
other
people
silently
dropped
again
into
their
seats
to
listen
as
the
four
sang
on
the
missionary
took
the
bass
and
his
wife
the
alto
and
the
four
made
music
worth
listening
to
the
rare
and
lovely
thing
about
it
was
that
they
sang
to
souls
not
alone
for
ears
and
so
their
music
classical
though
it
was
and
of
the
highest
order
appealed
keenly
to
the
hearts
of
these
rough
men
and
made
them
feel
that
heaven
had
opened
for
them
as
once
before
for
untaught
shepherds
and
let
down
a
ladder
of
angelic
voices
i
shall
feel
better
about
leaving
you
out
here
while
i
am
gone
since
they
have
come
said
gardley
that
night
when
he
was
bidding
margaret
good
night
i
could
bear
to
think
there
were
none
of
your
own
kind
about
you
the
others
are
devoted
and
would
do
for
you
with
their
lives
if
need
be
as
far
as
they
know
but
i
like
you
to
have
real
friends
this
man
is
what
i
call
a
christian
i
not
sure
but
he
is
the
first
minister
that
i
have
ever
come
close
to
who
has
impressed
me
as
believing
what
he
preaches
and
living
it
i
suppose
there
are
others
i
have
known
many
that
man
west
that
was
here
when
you
came
was
a
mistake
he
did
even
preach
much
smiled
margaret
so
how
could
he
live
it
this
man
is
real
and
there
are
others
oh
i
have
known
a
lot
of
them
that
are
living
lives
of
sacrifice
and
loving
service
and
are
yet
just
as
strong
and
happy
and
delightful
as
if
they
were
millionaires
but
they
are
the
men
who
have
not
thrown
away
their
bibles
and
their
christ
they
believe
every
promise
in
god
word
and
rest
on
them
day
by
day
testing
them
and
proving
them
over
and
over
i
wish
you
knew
my
father
i
am
going
to
said
gardley
proudly
am
going
to
him
just
as
soon
as
i
have
finished
my
business
and
straightened
out
my
affairs
and
i
am
going
to
tell
him
with
your
permission
margaret
oh
how
beautiful
cried
margaret
with
happy
tears
in
her
eyes
to
think
you
are
going
to
see
father
and
mother
i
have
wanted
them
to
know
the
real
you
i
could
half
you
the
real
you
in
a
letter
perhaps
they
wo
look
on
me
with
your
sweet
blindness
dear
he
said
smiling
tenderly
down
on
her
perhaps
they
will
see
only
my
dark
past
life
for
i
mean
to
tell
your
father
everything
i
not
going
to
have
any
skeletons
in
the
closet
to
cause
pain
hereafter
perhaps
your
father
and
mother
will
not
feel
like
giving
their
daughter
to
me
after
they
know
remember
i
realize
just
what
a
rare
prize
she
is
no
father
is
not
like
that
lance
said
margaret
with
her
rare
smile
lighting
up
her
happy
eyes
father
and
mother
will
understand
but
if
they
should
not
there
was
the
shadow
of
sadness
in
eyes
as
he
asked
the
question
i
belong
to
you
dear
anyway
she
said
with
sweet
surrender
i
trust
you
though
the
whole
world
were
against
you
for
answer
gardley
took
her
in
his
arms
a
look
of
awe
upon
his
face
and
stooping
laid
his
lips
upon
hers
in
tender
reverence
margaret
you
wonderful
margaret
he
said
god
has
blessed
me
more
than
other
men
in
sending
you
to
me
with
his
help
i
will
be
worthy
of
you
three
days
more
and
margaret
was
alone
with
her
school
work
her
two
missionary
friends
thirty
miles
away
her
eager
watching
for
the
mail
to
come
her
faithful
attendant
bud
and
for
comfort
the
purple
mountain
with
its
changing
glory
in
the
distance
a
few
days
before
gardley
left
for
the
east
he
had
been
offered
a
position
by
rogers
as
general
manager
of
his
estate
at
a
fine
salary
and
after
consultation
with
margaret
he
decided
to
accept
it
but
the
question
of
their
marriage
they
had
left
by
common
consent
unsettled
until
gardley
should
return
and
be
able
to
offer
his
future
wife
a
record
made
as
fair
and
clean
as
human
effort
could
make
it
after
human
mistakes
had
unmade
it
as
margaret
worked
and
waited
wrote
her
charming
letters
to
father
and
mother
and
lover
and
thought
her
happy
thoughts
with
only
the
mountain
for
confidant
she
did
not
plan
for
the
future
except
in
a
dim
and
dreamy
way
she
would
make
those
plans
with
gardley
when
he
returned
probably
they
must
wait
some
time
before
they
could
be
married
gardley
would
have
to
earn
some
money
and
she
must
earn
too
she
must
keep
the
ashland
school
for
another
year
it
had
been
rather
understood
when
she
came
out
that
if
at
all
possible
she
would
remain
two
years
at
least
it
was
hard
to
think
of
not
going
home
for
the
summer
vacation
but
the
trip
cost
a
great
deal
and
was
not
to
be
thought
of
there
was
already
a
plan
suggested
to
have
a
summer
session
of
the
school
and
if
that
went
through
of
course
she
must
stay
right
in
ashland
it
was
hard
to
think
of
not
seeing
her
father
and
mother
for
another
long
year
but
perhaps
gardley
would
be
returning
before
the
summer
was
over
and
then
it
would
not
be
so
hard
however
she
tried
to
put
these
thoughts
out
of
her
mind
and
do
her
work
happily
it
was
incredible
that
arizona
should
have
become
suddenly
so
blank
and
uninteresting
since
the
departure
of
a
man
whom
she
had
not
known
a
few
short
months
before
margaret
had
long
since
written
to
her
father
and
mother
about
first
finding
her
in
the
desert
the
thing
had
become
history
and
was
not
likely
to
alarm
them
she
had
been
in
arizona
long
enough
to
be
acquainted
with
things
and
they
would
not
be
always
thinking
of
her
as
sitting
on
stray
in
the
desert
so
she
told
them
about
it
for
she
wanted
them
to
know
gardley
as
he
had
been
to
her
the
letters
that
had
traveled
back
and
forth
between
new
york
and
arizona
had
been
full
of
gardley
and
still
margaret
had
not
told
her
parents
how
it
was
between
them
gardley
had
asked
that
he
might
do
that
yet
it
had
been
a
blind
father
and
mother
who
had
not
long
ago
read
between
the
lines
of
those
letters
and
understood
margaret
fancied
she
detected
a
certain
sense
of
relief
in
her
mother
letters
after
she
knew
that
gardley
had
gone
east
were
they
worrying
about
him
she
wondered
or
was
it
just
the
natural
dread
of
a
mother
to
lose
her
child
so
margaret
settled
down
to
school
routine
and
more
and
more
made
a
confidant
of
bud
concerning
little
matters
of
the
school
if
it
had
not
been
for
bud
at
that
time
margaret
would
have
been
lonely
indeed
two
or
three
times
since
gardley
left
the
brownleighs
had
ridden
over
to
sunday
service
and
once
had
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
during
the
week
on
their
way
to
visit
some
distant
need
these
occasions
were
a
delight
to
margaret
for
hazel
brownleigh
was
a
kindred
spirit
she
was
looking
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
visit
she
was
to
make
them
at
the
mission
station
as
soon
as
school
closed
she
had
been
there
once
with
gardley
before
he
left
but
the
ride
was
too
long
to
go
often
and
the
only
escort
available
was
bud
besides
she
could
not
get
away
from
school
and
the
sunday
service
at
present
but
it
was
pleasant
to
have
something
to
look
forward
to
meantime
the
spring
commencement
was
coming
on
and
margaret
had
her
hands
full
she
had
undertaken
to
inaugurate
a
real
commencement
with
class
day
and
as
much
form
and
ceremony
as
she
could
introduce
in
order
to
create
a
good
school
spirit
but
such
things
are
not
done
with
the
turn
of
a
hand
and
the
young
teacher
sadly
missed
gardley
in
all
these
preparations
at
this
time
rosa
rogers
was
margaret
particular
thorn
in
the
flesh
since
the
night
that
forsythe
had
quit
the
play
and
ridden
forth
into
the
darkness
rosa
had
regarded
her
teacher
with
baleful
eyes
gardley
too
she
hated
and
was
only
waiting
with
smoldering
wrath
until
her
wild
ungoverned
soul
could
take
its
revenge
she
felt
that
but
for
those
two
forsythe
would
still
have
been
with
her
margaret
realizing
the
passionate
untaught
nature
of
the
motherless
girl
and
her
great
need
of
a
friend
to
guide
her
made
attempt
after
attempt
to
reach
and
befriend
her
but
every
attempt
was
met
with
repulse
and
the
sharp
word
of
scorn
rosa
had
been
too
long
the
petted
darling
of
a
father
who
was
utterly
blind
to
her
faults
to
be
other
than
spoiled
her
own
way
was
the
one
thing
that
ruled
her
by
her
will
she
had
ruled
every
nurse
and
servant
about
the
place
and
wheedled
her
father
into
letting
her
do
anything
the
whim
prompted
twice
her
father
through
the
advice
of
friends
had
tried
the
experiment
of
sending
her
away
to
school
once
to
an
eastern
finishing
school
and
once
to
a
convent
on
the
pacific
coast
only
to
have
her
return
shortly
by
request
of
the
school
more
wilful
than
when
she
had
gone
away
and
now
she
ruled
supreme
in
her
father
home
disliked
by
most
of
the
servants
save
those
whom
she
chose
to
favor
because
they
could
be
made
to
serve
her
purposes
her
father
engrossed
in
his
business
and
away
much
of
the
time
was
bound
up
in
her
and
saw
few
of
her
faults
it
is
true
that
when
a
fault
of
hers
did
come
to
his
notice
however
he
dealt
with
it
most
severely
and
grieved
over
it
in
secret
for
the
girl
was
much
like
the
mother
whose
loss
had
emptied
the
world
of
its
joy
for
him
but
rosa
knew
well
how
to
manage
her
father
and
wheedle
him
and
also
how
to
hide
her
own
doings
from
his
knowledge
rosa
eyes
dimples
pink
cheeks
and
coquettish
little
mouth
were
not
idle
in
these
days
she
knew
how
to
have
every
pupil
at
her
feet
and
ready
to
obey
her
slightest
wish
she
wielded
her
power
to
its
fullest
extent
as
the
summer
drew
near
and
day
after
day
saw
a
slow
torture
for
margaret
some
days
the
menacing
air
of
insurrection
fairly
bristled
in
the
room
and
margaret
could
not
understand
how
some
of
her
most
devoted
followers
seemed
to
be
in
the
forefront
of
battle
until
one
day
she
looked
up
quickly
and
caught
the
glance
of
rosa
as
she
turned
from
smiling
at
the
boys
in
the
back
seat
then
she
understood
rosa
had
cast
her
spell
upon
the
boys
and
they
were
acting
under
it
and
not
of
their
own
clear
judgment
it
was
the
battle
of
sex
of
woman
against
woman
for
the
winning
of
the
man
to
do
her
will
margaret
using
all
the
charm
of
her
lovely
personality
to
uphold
standards
of
right
truth
purity
high
living
and
earnest
thinking
rosa
striving
with
her
impish
beauty
to
lure
them
into
mischief
so
it
foiled
the
purposes
and
one
day
margaret
faced
the
girl
alone
looking
steadily
into
her
eyes
with
sad
searching
gaze
and
almost
a
yearning
to
try
to
lead
the
pretty
child
to
finer
things
rosa
why
do
you
always
act
as
if
i
were
your
enemy
she
said
sadly
because
you
are
said
rosa
with
a
toss
of
her
independent
head
indeed
i
not
dear
child
she
said
putting
out
her
hand
to
lay
it
on
the
girl
shoulder
kindly
i
want
to
be
your
friend
i
not
a
child
snapped
rosa
jerking
her
shoulder
angrily
away
and
you
can
be
my
friend
because
i
you
rosa
look
here
said
margaret
following
the
girl
toward
the
door
the
color
rising
in
her
cheeks
and
a
desire
growing
in
her
heart
to
conquer
this
poor
passionate
creature
and
win
her
for
better
things
rosa
i
can
not
have
you
say
such
things
tell
me
why
you
hate
me
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
feel
that
way
i
sure
if
we
should
talk
it
over
we
might
come
to
some
better
understanding
rosa
stood
defiant
in
the
doorway
we
could
never
come
to
any
better
understanding
miss
earle
she
declared
in
a
cold
hard
tone
because
i
understand
you
now
and
i
hate
you
you
tried
your
best
to
get
my
friend
away
from
me
but
you
could
do
it
and
you
would
like
to
keep
me
from
having
any
boy
friends
at
all
but
you
ca
do
that
either
you
think
you
are
very
popular
but
you
find
out
i
always
do
what
i
like
and
you
need
try
to
stop
me
i
do
have
to
come
to
school
unless
i
choose
and
as
long
as
i
do
break
your
rules
you
have
no
complaint
coming
but
you
need
think
you
can
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
the
way
you
do
the
others
by
pretending
to
be
friends
i
wo
be
friends
i
hate
you
and
rosa
turned
grandly
and
marched
out
of
the
margaret
stood
gazing
sadly
after
her
and
wondering
if
her
failure
here
were
her
fault
if
there
was
anything
else
she
ought
to
have
done
if
she
had
let
her
personal
dislike
of
the
girl
influence
her
conduct
she
sat
for
some
time
at
her
desk
her
chin
in
her
hands
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
with
a
hopeless
discouraged
expression
in
them
before
she
became
aware
of
another
presence
in
the
room
looking
around
quickly
she
saw
that
bud
was
sitting
motionless
at
his
desk
his
forehead
wrinkled
in
a
fierce
frown
his
jaw
set
belligerently
and
a
look
of
such
unutterable
pity
and
devotion
in
his
eyes
that
her
heart
warmed
to
him
at
once
and
a
smile
of
comradeship
broke
over
her
face
oh
william
were
you
here
did
you
hear
all
that
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
matter
where
have
i
failed
you
failed
anywhere
you
should
worry
her
she
a
nut
if
she
was
a
boy
i
punch
her
head
for
her
but
seeing
she
only
a
girl
should
she
always
was
the
limit
bud
tone
was
forcible
he
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
boys
who
never
yielded
to
rosa
charms
but
sat
in
glowering
silence
when
she
exercised
her
powers
on
the
school
and
created
pandemonium
for
the
teacher
bud
attitude
was
comforting
it
had
a
touch
of
manliness
and
gentleness
about
it
quite
unwonted
for
him
it
suggested
beautiful
possibilities
for
the
future
of
his
character
and
margaret
smiled
tenderly
thank
you
dear
boy
she
said
gently
you
certainly
are
a
comfort
if
every
one
was
as
splendid
as
you
are
we
should
have
a
model
school
but
i
do
wish
i
could
help
rosa
i
ca
see
why
she
should
hate
me
so
i
must
have
made
some
big
mistake
with
her
in
the
first
place
to
antagonize
her
naw
said
bud
roughly
no
chance
she
just
a
that
all
she
got
a
case
on
that
forsythe
guy
the
worst
kind
and
she
afraid
somebody
get
him
away
from
her
the
poor
stew
as
if
anybody
would
get
a
case
on
a
tough
guy
like
that
gee
you
should
worry
come
on
let
take
a
ride
over
t
camp
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
margaret
accepted
bud
consolations
and
went
on
her
way
trying
to
find
some
manner
of
showing
rosa
what
a
real
friend
she
was
willing
to
be
but
rosa
continued
obdurate
and
hateful
regarding
her
teacher
with
haughty
indifference
except
when
she
was
called
upon
to
recite
which
she
did
sometimes
with
scornful
condescension
sometimes
with
pert
perfection
and
sometimes
with
saucy
humor
which
convulsed
the
whole
room
margaret
patience
was
almost
ceasing
to
be
a
virtue
and
she
meditated
often
whether
she
ought
not
to
request
that
the
girl
be
withdrawn
from
the
school
yet
she
reflected
that
it
was
a
very
short
time
now
until
commencement
and
that
rosa
had
not
openly
defied
any
rules
it
was
merely
a
personal
antagonism
then
too
if
rosa
were
taken
from
the
school
there
was
really
no
other
good
influence
in
the
girl
life
at
present
day
by
day
margaret
prayed
about
the
matter
and
hoped
that
something
would
develop
to
make
plain
her
way
after
much
thought
in
the
matter
she
decided
to
go
on
with
her
plans
letting
rosa
have
her
place
in
the
commencement
program
and
her
part
in
the
doings
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
certainly
there
was
nothing
laid
down
in
the
rules
of
a
public
school
that
proscribed
a
scholar
who
did
not
love
her
teacher
why
should
the
fact
that
one
had
incurred
the
hate
of
a
pupil
unfit
that
pupil
for
her
place
in
her
class
so
long
as
she
did
her
duties
and
rosa
did
hers
promptly
and
deftly
with
a
certain
piquant
originality
that
margaret
could
not
help
but
admire
sometimes
as
the
teacher
cast
a
furtive
look
at
the
pretty
girl
working
away
at
her
desk
she
wondered
what
was
going
on
behind
the
lovely
mask
but
the
look
in
rosa
eyes
when
she
raised
them
was
both
deep
and
sly
rosa
hatred
was
indeed
deep
rooted
whatever
heart
she
had
not
frivoled
away
in
wilfulness
had
been
caught
and
won
by
forsythe
the
first
grown
man
who
had
ever
dared
to
make
real
love
to
her
her
jealousy
of
margaret
was
the
most
intense
thing
that
had
ever
come
into
her
life
to
think
of
him
looking
at
margaret
talking
to
margaret
smiling
at
margaret
walking
or
riding
with
margaret
was
enough
to
send
her
writhing
upon
her
bed
in
the
darkness
of
a
wakeful
night
she
would
clench
her
pretty
hands
until
the
nails
dug
into
the
flesh
and
brought
the
blood
she
would
bite
the
pillow
or
the
blankets
with
an
almost
fiendish
clenching
of
her
teeth
upon
them
and
mutter
as
she
did
so
i
hate
her
i
her
i
could
her
the
day
her
first
letter
came
from
forsythe
rosa
held
her
head
high
and
went
about
the
school
as
if
she
were
a
princess
royal
and
margaret
were
the
dust
under
her
feet
triumph
sat
upon
her
like
a
crown
and
looked
forth
regally
from
her
eyes
she
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
felt
the
crackle
of
his
letter
inside
her
blouse
she
dreamed
with
her
eyes
upon
the
distant
mountain
and
thought
of
the
tender
names
he
had
called
her
little
wild
rose
of
his
heart
no
rose
in
all
the
world
until
you
came
and
a
lot
of
other
meaningful
sentences
a
real
all
her
own
no
sharing
him
with
any
hateful
teachers
he
had
implied
in
her
letter
that
she
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
people
in
that
region
to
whom
he
cared
to
write
he
had
said
he
was
coming
back
some
day
to
get
her
her
young
wild
heart
throbbed
exultantly
and
her
eyes
looked
forth
their
triumph
malignantly
when
he
did
come
she
would
take
care
that
he
stayed
close
by
her
no
conceited
teacher
from
the
east
should
lure
him
from
her
side
she
would
prepare
her
guiles
and
smile
her
sweetest
she
would
wear
fine
garments
from
abroad
and
show
him
she
could
far
outshine
that
quiet
common
miss
earle
with
all
her
airs
yet
to
this
end
she
studied
hard
it
was
no
part
of
her
plan
to
be
left
behind
at
she
would
please
her
father
by
taking
a
prominent
part
in
things
and
outdoing
all
the
others
then
he
would
give
her
what
she
liked
jewels
and
silk
dresses
and
all
the
things
a
girl
should
have
who
had
won
a
lover
like
hers
the
last
busy
days
before
commencement
were
especially
trying
for
margaret
it
seemed
as
if
the
children
were
possessed
with
the
very
spirit
of
mischief
and
she
could
not
help
but
see
that
it
was
rosa
who
sitting
demurely
in
her
desk
was
the
center
of
it
all
only
steady
frowning
countenance
of
all
that
rollicking
roistering
crowd
kept
loyalty
with
the
really
beloved
teacher
for
indeed
they
loved
her
every
one
but
rosa
and
would
have
stood
by
her
to
a
man
and
girl
when
it
really
came
to
the
pinch
but
in
a
matter
like
a
little
bit
of
fun
in
these
last
few
days
of
school
and
when
challenged
to
it
by
the
school
beauty
who
did
not
usually
condescend
to
any
but
a
few
of
the
older
boys
where
was
the
harm
they
were
so
flattered
by
rosa
smiles
that
they
failed
to
see
margaret
worn
weary
wistfulness
bud
coming
into
the
late
one
afternoon
in
search
of
her
after
the
other
scholars
had
gone
found
margaret
with
her
head
down
upon
the
desk
and
her
shoulders
shaken
with
soundless
sobs
he
stood
for
a
second
silent
in
the
doorway
gazing
helplessly
at
her
grief
then
with
the
delicacy
of
one
boy
for
another
he
slipped
back
outside
the
door
and
stood
in
the
shadow
grinding
his
teeth
gee
he
said
under
his
breath
oh
gee
i
like
to
punch
her
fool
head
i
do
care
if
she
is
a
girl
she
needs
it
gee
if
she
was
a
boy
would
i
settle
her
the
little
darned
mean
sneak
his
remarks
it
is
needless
to
say
did
not
have
reference
to
his
beloved
teacher
it
was
in
the
atmosphere
everywhere
that
something
was
bound
to
happen
if
this
strain
kept
up
margaret
knew
it
and
felt
utterly
inadequate
to
meet
it
rosa
knew
it
and
was
awaiting
her
opportunity
bud
knew
it
and
could
only
stand
and
watch
where
the
blow
was
to
strike
first
and
be
ready
to
ward
it
off
in
these
days
he
wished
fervently
for
return
he
did
not
know
just
what
gardley
could
do
about
that
little
fool
as
he
called
rosa
but
it
would
be
a
relief
to
be
able
to
tell
some
one
all
about
it
if
he
only
dared
leave
he
would
go
over
and
tell
jasper
kemp
about
it
just
to
share
his
burden
with
somebody
but
as
it
was
he
must
stick
to
the
job
for
the
present
and
bear
his
great
responsibility
and
so
the
days
hastened
by
to
the
last
sunday
before
commencement
which
was
to
be
on
monday
chapter
xxvii
margaret
had
spent
saturday
in
rehearsals
so
that
there
had
been
no
rest
for
her
sunday
morning
she
slept
late
and
awoke
from
a
troubled
dream
unrested
she
almost
meditated
whether
she
would
not
ask
some
one
to
read
a
sermon
at
the
afternoon
service
and
let
her
go
on
sleeping
then
a
memory
of
the
lonely
old
woman
at
the
camp
and
the
men
who
came
so
regularly
to
the
service
roused
her
to
effort
once
more
and
she
arose
and
tried
to
prepare
a
little
something
for
them
she
came
into
the
at
the
hour
looking
fagged
with
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
and
the
loving
eyes
of
mom
wallis
already
in
her
front
seat
watched
her
keenly
it
time
for
to
come
back
she
said
in
her
heart
gettin
peeked
i
wisht
he
come
margaret
had
hoped
that
rosa
would
not
come
the
girl
was
not
always
there
but
of
late
she
had
been
quite
regular
coming
in
late
with
her
father
just
a
little
after
the
story
had
begun
and
attracting
attention
by
her
smiles
and
bows
and
giggling
whispers
which
sometimes
were
so
audible
as
to
create
quite
a
diversion
from
the
speaker
but
rosa
came
in
early
and
took
a
seat
directly
in
front
of
margaret
in
about
the
middle
of
the
house
fixing
her
eyes
on
her
teacher
with
a
kind
of
settled
intention
that
made
margaret
shrink
as
if
from
a
danger
she
was
not
able
to
meet
there
was
something
bright
and
hard
and
daring
in
rosa
eyes
as
she
stared
unwinkingly
as
if
she
had
come
to
search
out
a
weak
spot
for
her
evil
purposes
and
margaret
was
so
tired
she
wanted
to
lay
her
head
down
on
her
desk
and
cry
she
drew
some
comfort
from
the
reflection
that
if
she
should
do
so
childish
a
thing
she
would
be
at
once
surrounded
by
a
strong
battalion
of
friends
from
the
camp
who
would
shield
her
with
their
lives
if
necessary
it
was
silly
of
course
and
she
must
control
this
choking
in
her
throat
only
how
was
she
ever
going
to
talk
with
rosa
looking
at
her
that
way
it
was
like
a
nightmare
pursuing
her
she
turned
to
the
piano
and
kept
them
all
singing
for
a
while
so
that
she
might
pray
in
her
heart
and
grow
calm
and
when
after
her
brief
earnest
prayer
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
audience
she
saw
with
intense
relief
that
the
brownleighs
were
in
the
audience
she
started
a
hymn
that
they
all
knew
and
when
they
were
well
in
the
midst
of
the
first
verse
she
slipped
from
the
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
aisle
to
brownleigh
side
would
you
please
talk
to
them
a
little
while
she
pleaded
wistfully
i
am
so
tired
i
feel
as
if
i
just
could
instantly
brownleigh
followed
her
back
to
the
desk
and
took
her
place
pulling
out
his
little
worn
bible
and
opening
it
with
familiar
fingers
to
a
beloved
passage
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
the
words
fell
on
margaret
tired
heart
like
balm
and
she
rested
her
head
back
against
the
wall
and
closed
her
eyes
to
listen
sitting
so
away
from
rosa
stare
she
could
forget
for
a
while
the
absurd
burdens
that
had
got
on
her
nerves
and
could
rest
down
hard
upon
her
saviour
every
word
that
the
man
of
god
spoke
seemed
meant
just
for
her
and
brought
strength
courage
and
new
trust
to
her
heart
she
forgot
the
little
crowd
of
other
listeners
and
took
the
message
to
herself
drinking
it
in
eagerly
as
one
who
has
been
a
long
time
ministering
accepts
a
ministry
when
she
moved
to
the
piano
again
for
the
closing
hymn
she
felt
new
strength
within
her
to
bear
the
trials
of
the
week
that
were
before
her
she
turned
smiling
and
brave
to
speak
to
those
who
always
crowded
around
to
shake
hands
and
have
a
word
before
leaving
hazel
putting
a
loving
arm
around
her
as
soon
as
she
could
get
up
to
the
front
began
to
speak
soothingly
you
poor
tired
child
she
said
you
are
almost
worn
to
a
frazzle
you
need
a
big
change
and
i
going
to
plan
it
for
you
just
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
how
would
you
like
to
go
with
us
on
our
trip
among
the
indians
would
it
be
great
it

depending
on
how

go
but
john
wants
to
visit
the
hopi
reservation
if
possible

it

so
interesting
they

most
strange
people

a
delightful
trip

the
stars

to
make
a
journey

other
direction

but
your
commencement

it
i
so
sorry

but
this
other
matter
is
important
and
john
has
to
go
early
in
the
morning
some
one
very
sick
who
wants
to
see
him
before
he
dies
an
old
indian
who
did
know
a
thing
about
jesus

day

or

an
old
indian
who

way
but
away
buying
cattle
maybe
john
can
think
of
a
way
we
could
send
for
you
early
in
the
week
then
you
would
be
ready
to
go
with
us
on
the
trip
you
would
like
to
go
would
you
oh
so
much
said
margaret
with
a
sigh
of
wistfulness
i
ca
think
of
anything
pleasanter
margaret
turned
suddenly
and
there
just
behind
her
almost
touching
her
stood
rosa
that
strange
baleful
gleam
in
her
eyes
like
a
serpent
who
was
biding
her
time
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
knowing
she
had
her
victim
where
she
could
not
move
before
she
struck
it
was
a
strange
fancy
of
course
and
one
that
was
caused
by
sick
nerves
but
margaret
drew
back
and
almost
cried
out
as
if
for
some
one
to
protect
her
then
her
strong
common
sense
came
to
the
rescue
and
she
rallied
and
smiled
at
rosa
a
faint
little
sorry
smile
it
was
hard
to
smile
at
the
bright
baleful
face
with
the
menace
in
the
eyes
hazel
was
watching
her
you
poor
child
you
quite
worn
out
afraid
you
going
to
be
sick
oh
no
said
margaret
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
things
have
just
got
on
my
nerves
that
all
it
been
a
particularly
trying
time
i
shall
be
all
right
when
night
is
over
well
we
going
to
send
for
you
very
soon
so
be
ready
and
hazel
followed
her
husband
waving
her
hand
in
gay
parting
rosa
was
still
standing
just
behind
her
when
margaret
turned
back
to
her
desk
and
the
younger
girl
gave
her
one
last
dagger
look
a
glitter
in
her
eyes
so
sinister
and
vindictive
that
margaret
felt
a
shudder
run
through
her
whole
body
and
was
glad
that
just
then
rosa
father
called
to
her
that
they
must
be
starting
home
only
one
more
day
now
of
rosa
and
she
would
be
done
with
her
perhaps
forever
the
girl
was
through
the
school
course
and
was
graduating
it
was
not
likely
she
would
return
another
year
her
opportunity
was
over
to
help
her
she
had
failed
why
she
could
tell
but
she
had
strangely
failed
and
all
she
asked
now
was
not
to
have
to
endure
the
hard
cold
young
presence
any
longer
sick
nerves
margaret
she
said
to
herself
go
home
and
go
to
bed
you
be
all
right
and
she
locked
the
door
and
walked
quietly
home
with
the
faithful
bud
the
past
month
had
been
a
trying
time
also
for
rosa
young
wild
and
motherless
passionate
wilful
and
impetuous
she
was
finding
life
tremendously
exciting
just
now
with
no
one
to
restrain
her
or
warn
her
she
was
playing
with
forces
that
she
did
not
understand
she
had
subjugated
easily
all
the
boys
in
school
keeping
them
exactly
where
she
wanted
them
for
her
purpose
and
using
methods
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
woman
of
the
world
but
by
far
the
greatest
force
in
her
life
was
her
infatuation
for
forsythe
the
letters
had
traveled
back
and
forth
many
times
between
them
since
forsythe
wrote
that
first
he
found
a
whimsical
pleasure
in
her
deep
devotion
and
naïve
readiness
to
follow
as
far
as
he
cared
to
lead
her
he
realized
that
young
as
she
was
she
was
no
innocent
which
made
the
acquaintance
all
the
more
interesting
he
meantime
idled
away
a
few
months
on
the
pacific
coast
making
mild
love
to
a
rich
california
girl
and
considering
whether
or
not
he
was
ready
yet
to
settle
down
in
the
mean
time
his
correspondence
with
rosa
took
on
such
a
nature
that
his
volatile
impulsive
nature
was
stirred
with
a
desire
to
see
her
again
it
was
not
often
that
once
out
of
sight
he
looked
back
to
a
victim
but
rosa
had
shown
a
daring
and
a
spirit
in
her
letters
that
sent
a
challenge
to
his
sated
senses
moreover
the
california
heiress
was
going
on
a
journey
besides
an
old
enemy
of
his
who
knew
altogether
too
much
of
his
past
had
appeared
on
the
scene
and
as
gardley
had
been
removed
from
the
ashland
vicinity
for
a
time
forsythe
felt
it
might
be
safe
to
venture
back
again
there
was
always
that
pretty
spirited
little
teacher
if
rosa
failed
to
charm
but
why
should
rosa
not
charm
and
why
should
he
not
yield
rosa
father
was
a
good
sort
and
had
all
kinds
of
property
rosa
was
her
father
only
heir
on
the
whole
forsythe
decided
that
the
best
move
he
could
make
next
would
be
to
return
to
arizona
if
things
turned
out
well
he
might
even
think
of
marrying
rosa
this
was
somewhat
the
train
of
thought
that
led
forsythe
at
last
to
write
to
rosa
that
he
was
coming
throwing
rosa
into
a
panic
of
joy
and
alarm
for
rosa
father
had
been
most
explicit
about
her
ever
going
out
with
forsythe
again
it
had
been
the
most
relentless
command
he
had
ever
laid
upon
her
spoken
in
a
tone
she
hardly
ever
disobeyed
moreover
rosa
was
fearfully
jealous
of
margaret
if
forsythe
should
come
and
begin
to
hang
around
the
teacher
rosa
felt
she
would
go
wild
or
do
something
terrible
perhaps
even
kill
somebody
she
shut
her
sharp
little
white
teeth
fiercely
down
into
her
red
under
lip
and
vowed
with
flashing
eyes
that
he
should
never
see
margaret
again
if
power
of
hers
could
prevent
it
the
letter
from
forsythe
had
reached
her
on
saturday
evening
and
she
had
come
to
the
sunday
service
with
the
distinct
idea
of
trying
to
plan
how
she
might
get
rid
of
margaret
it
would
be
hard
enough
to
evade
her
father
vigilance
if
he
once
found
out
the
young
man
had
returned
but
to
have
him
begin
to
go
and
see
margaret
again
was
a
thing
she
could
not
and
would
not
stand
the
idea
obsessed
her
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
and
made
her
watch
her
teacher
as
if
by
her
very
concentration
of
thought
upon
her
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
might
be
evolved
as
if
margaret
herself
might
give
forth
a
hint
of
weakness
somewhere
that
would
show
her
how
to
plan
to
that
intent
she
had
come
close
in
the
group
with
the
others
around
the
teacher
at
the
close
of
meeting
and
so
standing
had
overheard
all
that
the
brownleighs
had
said
the
lightning
flash
of
triumph
that
she
cast
at
margaret
as
she
left
the
was
her
own
signal
that
she
had
found
a
way
at
last
her
opportunity
had
come
and
just
in
time
forsythe
was
to
arrive
in
arizona
some
time
on
tuesday
and
wanted
rosa
to
meet
him
at
one
of
their
old
out
some
distance
from
her
father
house
he
knew
that
school
would
just
be
over
for
she
had
written
him
about
commencement
and
so
he
understood
that
she
would
be
free
but
he
did
not
know
that
the
place
he
had
selected
to
meet
her
was
on
one
of
margaret
favorite
trails
where
she
and
bud
often
rode
in
the
late
afternoons
and
that
above
all
things
rosa
wished
to
avoid
any
danger
of
meeting
her
teacher
for
she
not
only
feared
that
attention
would
be
drawn
away
from
her
but
also
that
margaret
might
feel
it
her
duty
to
report
to
her
father
about
her
clandestine
meeting
rosa
heart
beat
high
as
she
rode
demurely
home
with
her
father
answering
his
pleasantries
with
smiles
and
dimples
and
a
coaxing
word
just
as
he
loved
to
have
her
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
her
father
though
she
kept
well
her
mask
of
interest
in
what
he
had
to
say
she
was
trying
to
plan
how
she
might
use
what
she
had
heard
to
get
rid
of
margaret
earle
if
only
brownleigh
would
do
as
she
had
hinted
and
send
some
one
tuesday
morning
to
escort
miss
earle
over
to
her
home
all
would
be
clear
sailing
for
rosa
but
she
dared
not
trust
to
such
a
possibility
there
were
not
many
escorts
coming
their
way
from
ganado
and
rosa
happened
to
know
that
the
old
indian
who
frequently
escorted
parties
was
off
in
another
direction
she
could
not
rest
on
any
such
hope
when
she
reached
home
she
went
at
once
to
her
room
and
sat
beside
her
window
gazing
off
at
the
purple
mountains
in
deep
thought
then
she
lighted
a
candle
and
went
in
search
of
a
certain
little
testament
long
since
neglected
and
covered
with
dust
she
found
it
at
last
on
the
top
of
a
pile
of
books
in
a
dark
closet
and
dragged
it
forth
eagerly
turning
the
pages
yes
there
it
was
and
in
it
a
small
envelope
directed
to
miss
rosa
rogers
in
a
fine
angular
handwriting
the
letter
was
from
the
missionary
wife
to
the
little
girl
who
had
recited
her
texts
so
beautifully
as
to
earn
the
testament
rosa
carried
it
to
her
desk
secured
a
good
light
and
sat
down
to
read
it
over
carefully
no
thought
of
her
innocent
childish
exultation
over
that
letter
came
to
her
now
she
was
intent
on
one
thing
the
handwriting
could
she
seize
the
secret
of
it
and
reproduce
it
she
had
before
often
done
so
with
great
success
she
could
imitate
miss
earle
writing
so
perfectly
that
she
often
took
an
impish
pleasure
in
changing
words
in
the
questions
on
the
blackboard
and
making
them
read
absurdly
for
the
benefit
of
the
school
it
was
such
good
sport
to
see
the
amazement
on
margaret
face
when
her
attention
would
be
called
to
it
by
a
hilarious
class
and
to
watch
her
troubled
brow
when
she
read
what
she
supposed
she
had
written
when
rosa
was
but
a
little
child
she
used
to
boast
that
she
could
write
her
father
name
in
perfect
imitation
of
his
signature
and
often
signed
some
trifling
receipt
for
him
just
for
amusement
a
dangerous
gift
in
the
hands
of
a
conscienceless
girl
yet
this
was
the
first
time
that
rosa
had
really
planned
to
use
her
art
in
any
serious
way
perhaps
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
doing
wrong
at
present
her
heart
was
too
full
of
hate
and
fear
and
jealous
love
to
care
for
right
or
wrong
or
anything
else
it
is
doubtful
if
she
would
have
hesitated
a
second
even
if
the
thing
she
was
planning
had
suddenly
appeared
to
her
in
the
light
of
a
great
crime
she
seemed
sometimes
almost
like
a
creature
without
moral
sense
so
swayed
was
she
by
her
own
desires
and
feelings
she
was
blind
now
to
everything
but
her
great
desire
to
get
margaret
out
of
the
way
and
have
forsythe
to
herself
long
after
her
father
and
the
servants
were
asleep
rosa
light
burned
while
she
bent
over
her
desk
writing
page
after
page
she
covered
with
careful
copies
of
brownleigh
letter
written
to
herself
almost
three
years
before
finally
she
wrote
out
the
alphabet
bit
by
bit
as
she
picked
it
from
the
words
learning
just
how
each
letter
was
habitually
formed
the
small
letters
and
the
capitals
with
the
peculiarities
of
connection
and
ending
at
last
when
she
lay
down
to
rest
she
felt
herself
capable
of
writing
a
pretty
fair
letter
in
brownleigh
handwriting
the
next
thing
was
to
make
her
plan
and
compose
her
letter
she
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
and
trying
to
think
just
what
she
could
do
in
the
first
place
she
settled
it
that
margaret
must
be
gotten
to
walpi
at
least
it
would
not
do
to
send
her
to
ganado
where
the
mission
station
was
for
that
was
a
comparatively
short
journey
and
she
could
easily
go
in
a
day
when
the
fraud
was
discovered
as
of
course
it
would
be
when
brownleigh
heard
of
it
margaret
would
perhaps
return
to
find
out
who
had
done
it
no
she
must
be
sent
all
the
way
to
walpi
if
possible
that
would
take
at
least
two
nights
and
the
most
of
two
days
to
get
there
forsythe
had
said
his
stay
was
to
be
short
by
the
time
margaret
got
back
from
walpi
forsythe
would
be
gone
but
how
manage
to
get
her
to
walpi
without
her
suspicions
being
aroused
she
might
word
the
note
so
that
margaret
would
be
told
to
come
expecting
to
meet
the
missionaries
say
at
keams
there
was
a
trail
straight
up
from
ashland
to
keams
cutting
off
quite
a
distance
and
leaving
ganado
off
at
the
right
keams
was
nearly
forty
miles
west
of
ganado
that
would
do
nicely
then
if
she
could
manage
to
have
another
note
left
at
keams
saying
they
could
not
wait
and
had
gone
on
margaret
would
suspect
nothing
and
go
all
the
way
to
walpi
that
would
be
fine
and
would
give
the
an
interesting
experience
which
would
hurt
her
in
the
least
rosa
thought
it
might
be
rather
interesting
than
otherwise
she
had
no
compunctions
whatever
about
how
margaret
might
feel
when
she
arrived
in
that
strange
indian
town
and
found
no
friends
awaiting
her
her
only
worry
was
where
she
was
to
find
a
suitable
escort
for
she
felt
assured
that
margaret
would
not
start
out
alone
with
one
man
servant
on
an
expedition
that
would
keep
her
out
overnight
and
where
in
all
that
region
could
she
find
a
woman
whom
she
could
trust
to
send
on
the
errand
it
almost
looked
as
though
the
thing
were
an
impossibility
she
lay
tossing
and
puzzling
over
it
till
gray
dawn
stole
into
the
room
she
mentally
reviewed
every
servant
on
the
place
on
whom
she
could
rely
to
do
her
bidding
and
keep
her
secret
but
there
was
some
reason
why
each
one
would
not
do
she
scanned
the
country
even
considering
old
ouida
who
had
been
living
in
a
shack
over
beyond
the
fort
ever
since
her
cabin
had
been
raided
but
old
ouida
was
too
notorious
tanner
would
keep
margaret
from
going
with
her
even
if
margaret
herself
did
not
know
the
old
woman
reputation
rosa
considered
if
there
were
any
way
of
wheedling
mom
wallis
into
the
affair
and
gave
that
up
remembering
the
suspicious
little
twinkling
eyes
of
jasper
kemp
at
last
she
fell
asleep
with
her
plan
still
unformed
but
her
determination
to
carry
it
through
just
as
strong
as
ever
if
worst
came
to
worst
she
would
send
the
cook
from
the
ranch
kitchen
and
put
something
in
the
note
about
his
expecting
to
meet
his
sister
an
hour
ride
out
on
the
trail
the
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
money
and
rosa
had
no
trouble
in
getting
all
she
wanted
of
that
commodity
but
the
was
an
fellow
and
she
feared
lest
margaret
would
not
like
to
go
with
him
however
he
should
be
a
last
resort
she
would
not
be
balked
in
her
purpose
chapter
xxviii
rosa
awoke
very
early
for
her
sleep
had
been
light
and
troubled
she
dressed
hastily
and
sat
down
to
compose
a
note
which
could
be
altered
slightly
in
case
she
found
some
one
better
than
the
but
before
she
was
half
through
the
phrasing
she
heard
a
slight
disturbance
below
her
window
and
a
muttering
in
guttural
tones
from
a
strange
voice
glancing
hastily
out
she
saw
some
indians
below
talking
with
one
of
the
men
who
was
shaking
his
head
and
motioning
to
them
that
they
must
go
on
that
this
was
no
place
for
them
to
stop
the
indian
motioned
to
his
squaw
sitting
on
a
dilapidated
little
burro
with
a
small
papoose
in
her
arms
and
looking
both
dirty
and
miserable
he
muttered
as
though
he
were
pleading
for
something
we
believe
that
god
angels
follow
the
feet
of
little
children
and
needy
ones
to
protect
them
does
the
devil
also
send
his
angels
to
lead
unwary
ones
astray
and
to
protect
the
plan
of
the
erring
ones
if
so
then
he
must
have
sent
these
indians
that
morning
to
further
plans
and
instantly
she
recognized
her
opportunity
she
leaned
out
of
her
window
and
spoke
in
a
clear
reproving
voice
james
what
does
he
want
breakfast
you
know
father
would
want
any
hungry
person
to
be
turned
away
let
them
sit
down
on
the
bench
there
and
tell
dorset
i
said
to
give
them
a
good
hot
breakfast
and
get
some
milk
for
the
baby
be
quick
about
it
too
james
started
and
frowned
at
the
clear
commanding
voice
the
squaw
turned
grateful
animal
eyes
up
to
the
little
beauty
in
the
window
muttering
some
inarticulate
thanks
while
the
stolid
indian
eyes
glittered
hopefully
though
the
muscles
of
his
countenance
changed
not
an
atom
rosa
smiled
radiantly
and
ran
down
to
see
that
her
orders
were
obeyed
she
tried
to
talk
a
little
with
the
squaw
but
found
she
understood
very
little
english
the
indian
spoke
better
and
gave
her
their
brief
story
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
navajo
reservation
to
the
far
north
they
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
their
last
scanty
provisions
by
prowling
coyotes
during
the
night
and
were
in
need
of
food
rosa
gave
them
a
place
to
sit
down
and
a
plentiful
breakfast
and
ordered
that
a
small
store
of
provisions
should
be
prepared
for
their
journey
after
they
had
rested
then
she
hurried
up
to
her
room
to
finish
her
letter
she
had
her
plan
well
fixed
now
these
strangers
should
be
her
willing
messengers
now
and
then
as
she
wrote
she
lifted
her
head
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
where
she
could
see
the
squaw
busy
with
her
little
one
and
her
eyes
fairly
glittered
with
satisfaction
nothing
could
have
been
better
planned
than
this
she
wrote
her
note
carefully
dear
margaret
she
had
heard
hazel
call
margaret
by
her
first
name
and
rightly
judged
that
their
new
friendship
was
already
strong
enough
to
justify
this
intimacy
i
have
found
just
the
opportunity
i
wanted
for
you
to
come
to
us
these
indians
are
thoroughly
trustworthy
and
are
coming
in
just
the
direction
to
bring
you
to
a
point
where
we
will
meet
you
we
have
decided
to
go
on
to
walpi
at
once
and
will
probably
meet
you
near
keams
or
a
little
farther
on
the
indian
knows
the
way
and
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
trust
him
perfectly

at
once

you
will
meet
us
in
time

has
to
go
on
as
fast
as
possible
i
know
you
will
enjoy
the
trip
and
am
so
glad
you
are
coming
lovingly
hazel
radcliffe
brownleigh
rosa
read
it
over
comparing
it
carefully
with
the
little
yellow
note
from
her
testament
and
decided
that
it
was
a
very
good
imitation
she
could
almost
hear
brownleigh
saying
what
she
had
written
rosa
really
was
quite
clever
she
had
done
it
well
she
hastily
sealed
and
addressed
her
letter
and
then
hurried
down
to
talk
with
the
indians
again
the
place
she
had
ordered
for
them
to
rest
was
at
some
distance
from
the
kitchen
door
a
sort
of
outshed
for
the
shelter
of
certain
implements
used
about
the
ranch
a
long
bench
ran
in
front
of
it
and
a
big
tree
made
a
goodly
shade
the
indians
had
found
their
temporary
camp
quite
inviting
rosa
made
a
detour
of
the
shed
satisfied
herself
that
no
one
was
within
hearing
and
then
sat
down
on
the
bench
ostensibly
playing
with
the
papoose
dangling
a
red
ball
on
a
ribbon
before
his
dazzled
eyes
and
bringing
forth
a
gurgle
of
delight
from
the
dusky
little
mummy
while
she
played
she
talked
idly
with
the
indians
had
they
money
enough
for
their
journey
would
they
like
to
earn
some
would
they
act
as
guide
to
a
lady
who
wanted
to
go
to
walpi
at
least
she
wanted
to
go
as
far
as
keams
where
she
might
meet
friends
missionaries
who
were
going
on
with
her
to
walpi
to
visit
the
indians
if
they
did
meet
her
she
wanted
to
be
guided
all
the
way
to
walpi
would
they
undertake
it
it
would
pay
them
well
they
would
get
money
enough
for
their
journey
and
have
some
left
when
they
got
to
the
reservation
and
rosa
displayed
two
gold
pieces
temptingly
in
her
small
palms
the
indian
uttered
a
guttural
sort
of
gasp
at
sight
of
so
much
money
and
sat
upright
he
gasped
again
indicating
by
a
solemn
nod
that
he
was
agreeable
to
the
task
before
him
and
the
girl
went
gaily
on
with
her
instructions
you
will
have
to
take
some
things
along
to
make
the
lady
comfortable
i
will
see
that
those
are
got
ready
then
you
can
have
the
things
for
your
own
when
you
leave
the
lady
at
walpi
you
will
have
to
take
a
letter
to
the
lady
and
tell
her
you
are
going
this
afternoon
and
she
must
be
ready
to
start
at
once
or
she
will
not
meet
the
missionary
tell
her
you
can
only
wait
until
three
to
start
you
will
find
the
lady
at
the
at
noon
you
must
not
come
till
noon
rosa
pointed
to
the
sun
and
then
straight
overhead
the
indian
watched
her
keenly
and
nodded
you
must
ask
for
miss
earle
and
give
her
this
letter
she
is
the
the
indian
grunted
and
looked
at
the
white
missive
in
rosa
hand
noting
once
more
the
gleam
of
the
gold
pieces
you
must
wait
till
the
teacher
goes
to
her
and
packs
her
things
and
eats
her
dinner
if
anybody
asks
where
you
came
from
you
must
say
the
missionary
wife
from
ganado
sent
you
do
tell
anybody
anything
else
do
you
understand
more
money
if
you
do
say
anything
rosa
clinked
the
gold
pieces
softly
the
strange
gaze
of
the
indian
narrowed
comprehensively
he
understood
his
native
cunning
was
being
bought
for
this
girl
own
purposes
he
looked
greedily
at
the
money
rosa
had
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
brought
out
yet
another
gold
piece
see
i
give
you
this
one
now
she
laid
one
gold
piece
in
the
hand
and
these
two
i
put
in
an
envelope
and
pack
with
some
provisions
and
blankets
on
another
horse
i
will
leave
the
horse
tied
to
a
tree
up
where
the
big
trail
crosses
this
big
trail
out
that
way
you
know
rosa
pointed
in
the
direction
she
meant
and
the
indian
looked
and
grunted
his
eyes
returning
to
the
two
gold
pieces
in
her
hand
it
was
a
great
deal
of
money
for
the
little
lady
to
give
was
she
trying
to
cheat
him
he
looked
down
at
the
gold
he
already
held
it
was
good
money
he
was
sure
of
that
he
looked
at
her
keenly
i
shall
be
watching
and
i
shall
know
whether
you
have
the
lady
or
not
went
on
the
girl
sharply
if
you
do
not
bring
the
lady
with
you
there
will
be
no
money
and
no
provisions
waiting
for
you
but
if
you
bring
the
lady
you
can
untie
the
horse
and
take
him
with
you
you
will
need
the
horse
to
carry
the
things
when
you
get
to
walpi
you
can
set
him
free
he
is
branded
and
he
will
likely
come
back
we
shall
find
him
see
i
will
put
the
gold
pieces
in
this
tin
can
she
picked
up
a
that
lay
at
her
feet
slipped
the
gold
pieces
in
an
envelope
from
her
pocket
stuffed
it
in
the
tin
bent
down
the
cover
and
held
it
up
this
can
will
be
packed
on
the
top
of
the
other
provisions
and
you
can
open
it
and
take
the
money
out
when
you
untie
the
horse
then
hurry
on
as
fast
as
you
can
and
get
as
far
along
the
trail
as
possible
before
you
camp
do
you
understand
the
indian
nodded
once
more
and
rosa
felt
that
she
had
a
confederate
worthy
of
her
need
she
stayed
a
few
minutes
more
going
carefully
over
her
directions
telling
the
indian
to
be
sure
his
squaw
was
kind
to
the
lady
and
that
on
no
account
he
should
let
the
lady
get
uneasy
or
have
cause
to
complain
of
her
treatment
or
trouble
would
surely
come
to
him
at
last
she
felt
sure
she
had
made
him
understand
and
she
hurried
away
to
slip
into
her
pretty
white
dress
and
ribbons
and
ride
to
school
before
she
left
her
room
she
glanced
out
of
the
window
at
the
indians
and
saw
them
sitting
motionless
like
a
group
of
bronze
once
the
indian
stirred
and
putting
his
hand
in
his
bosom
drew
forth
the
white
letter
she
had
given
him
gazed
at
it
a
moment
and
hid
it
in
his
breast
again
she
nodded
her
satisfaction
as
she
turned
from
the
window
the
next
thing
was
to
get
to
school
and
play
her
own
part
in
the
commencement
exercises
the
morning
was
bright
and
the
was
already
filled
to
overflowing
when
rosa
arrived
her
coming
as
always
made
a
little
stir
among
admiring
groups
for
even
those
who
feared
her
admired
her
from
afar
she
fluttered
into
the
and
up
the
aisle
with
the
air
of
a
princess
who
knew
she
had
been
waited
for
and
was
condescending
to
come
at
all
rosa
was
in
everything
the
drills
the
march
the
choruses
and
the
crowning
oration
she
went
through
it
all
with
the
perfection
of
a
bright
mind
and
an
adaptable
nature
one
would
never
have
dreamed
to
look
at
her
pretty
dimpling
face
and
her
sparkling
eyes
what
diabolical
things
were
moving
in
her
mind
nor
how
those
eyes
with
lurking
sweetness
and
treachery
were
watching
all
the
time
furtively
for
the
appearance
of
the
old
indian
at
last
she
saw
him
standing
in
a
group
just
outside
the
window
near
the
platform
his
tall
form
and
stern
countenance
marking
him
among
the
crowd
of
familiar
faces
she
was
receiving
her
diploma
from
the
hand
of
margaret
when
she
caught
his
eye
and
her
hand
trembled
just
a
quiver
as
she
took
the
dainty
roll
tied
with
blue
and
white
ribbons
that
he
recognized
her
she
was
sure
that
he
knew
she
did
not
wish
him
to
make
known
his
connection
with
her
she
felt
equally
convinced
he
understood
his
eye
had
that
comprehending
look
of
withdrawal
she
did
not
look
up
directly
at
him
again
her
eyes
were
daintily
downward
nevertheless
she
missed
not
a
turn
of
his
head
not
a
glance
from
that
stern
eye
and
she
knew
the
moment
when
he
stood
at
the
front
door
of
the
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
stolid
and
indifferent
yet
a
great
force
to
be
reckoned
with
some
one
looked
at
the
letter
pointed
to
margaret
called
her
and
she
came
rosa
was
not
far
away
all
the
time
talking
with
jed
her
eyes
downcast
her
cheeks
dimpling
missing
nothing
that
could
be
heard
or
seen
margaret
read
the
letter
rosa
watched
her
knew
every
curve
of
every
letter
and
syllable
as
she
read
held
her
breath
and
watched
expression
did
she
suspect
no
a
look
of
intense
relief
and
pleasure
had
come
into
her
eyes
she
was
glad
to
have
found
a
way
to
go
she
turned
to
tanner
what
do
you
think
of
this
tanner
i
to
go
with
brownleigh
on
a
trip
to
walpi
is
that
delicious
i
to
start
at
once
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
a
bite
to
eat
i
wo
need
much
i
too
tired
to
eat
and
too
anxious
to
be
off
if
you
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
sandwich
i
be
all
right
i
got
things
about
ready
to
go
for
brownleigh
told
me
she
would
send
some
one
for
me
h
said
tanner
disapprovingly
who
you
goin
with
just
i
do
much
like
looks
she
spoke
in
a
low
tone
so
the
indian
would
not
hear
and
it
was
almost
in
rosa
very
ear
who
stood
just
behind
rosa
heart
stopped
a
beat
and
she
frowned
at
the
toe
of
her
slipper
was
this
common
little
tanner
woman
going
to
be
the
one
to
balk
her
plans
margaret
raised
her
head
now
for
her
first
good
look
at
the
indian
and
it
must
be
admitted
a
chill
came
into
her
heart
then
as
if
he
comprehended
what
was
at
stake
the
indian
turned
slightly
and
pointed
down
the
path
toward
the
road
by
common
consent
the
few
who
were
standing
about
the
door
stepped
back
and
made
a
vista
for
margaret
to
see
the
squaw
sitting
on
her
scraggy
little
pony
gazing
off
at
the
mountain
in
the
distance
as
if
she
were
sitting
for
her
picture
her
solemn
little
papoose
strapped
to
her
back
margaret
troubled
eyes
cleared
the
family
aspect
made
things
all
right
again
you
see
he
has
his
wife
and
child
she
said
it
all
right
brownleigh
says
she
trusts
him
perfectly
and
i
to
meet
them
on
the
way
read
the
letter
she
thrust
the
letter
into
tanner
hand
and
rosa
trembled
for
her
scheme
once
more
surely
surely
tanner
would
not
be
able
to
detect
the
forgery
h
well
i
it
all
right
if
she
says
so
but
i
sure
i
relish
them
pesky
injuns
and
i
do
think
that
squaw
wife
of
his
looks
any
great
shakes
either
they
look
to
me
like
they
needed
a
good
scrub
with
bristol
brick
but
then
if
you
set
on
going
you
go
i
jest
wish
bud
had
gone
home
with
that
jasper
kemp
he
might
gone
along
an
then
you
had
somebody
to
speak
english
to
yes
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
william
along
said
margaret
but
i
think
i
be
all
right
brownleigh
would
send
anybody
that
was
nice
h
i
she
an
awful
crank
she
just
loves
them
injuns
they
say
but
i
fer
one
draw
the
line
at
holdin
in
my
lap
i
in
mixin
folks
up
that
way
preach
to
if
you
like
but
let
keep
their
distance
i
say
margaret
laughed
and
went
off
to
pick
up
her
things
rosa
stood
smiling
and
talking
to
jed
until
she
saw
margaret
and
tanner
go
off
together
the
indians
riding
slowly
along
behind
rosa
waited
until
the
indians
had
turned
off
the
road
down
toward
the
tanners
and
then
she
mounted
her
own
pony
and
rode
swiftly
home
she
rushed
up
to
her
room
and
took
off
her
fine
apparel
arraying
herself
quickly
in
a
plain
little
gown
and
went
down
to
prepare
the
provisions
there
was
none
too
much
time
and
she
must
work
rapidly
it
was
well
for
her
plans
that
she
was
with
the
servants
and
could
send
them
about
at
will
to
get
them
out
of
her
way
she
invented
a
duty
for
each
now
that
would
take
them
for
a
few
minutes
well
out
of
sight
and
sound
then
she
hurried
together
the
provisions
in
a
basket
making
two
trips
to
get
them
to
the
shelter
where
she
had
told
the
indian
he
would
find
the
horse
tied
she
had
to
make
a
third
trip
to
bring
the
blankets
and
a
few
other
things
she
knew
would
be
indispensable
but
the
whole
outfit
was
really
but
carelessly
gotten
together
and
it
was
just
by
chance
that
some
things
got
in
at
all
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
the
old
cayuse
she
intended
using
for
a
he
was
browsing
around
in
the
corral
and
she
soon
had
a
halter
over
his
head
for
she
had
been
quite
used
to
horses
from
her
babyhood
she
packed
the
canned
things
tinned
meats
vegetables
and
fruit
into
a
couple
of
large
sacks
adding
some
fodder
for
the
horses
a
box
of
matches
some
corn
bread
of
which
there
was
always
plenty
on
hand
in
the
house
some
salt
pork
and
a
few
tin
dishes
these
she
slung
pack
fashion
over
the
old
horse
fastened
the
containing
the
gold
pieces
where
it
would
be
easily
found
tied
the
horse
to
a
tree
and
retired
behind
a
shelter
of
to
watch
it
was
not
long
before
the
little
caravan
came
the
indians
riding
ahead
single
file
like
two
graven
images
moving
not
a
muscle
of
their
faces
and
margaret
a
little
way
behind
on
her
own
pony
her
face
as
happy
and
relieved
as
if
she
were
a
child
let
out
from
a
hard
task
to
play
the
indian
stopped
beside
the
horse
a
glitter
of
satisfaction
in
his
eyes
as
he
saw
that
the
little
lady
had
fulfilled
her
part
of
the
bargain
he
indicated
to
the
squaw
and
the
lady
that
they
might
move
on
down
the
trail
and
he
would
catch
up
with
them
and
then
dismounted
pouncing
warily
upon
the
at
once
he
looked
furtively
about
then
took
out
the
money
and
tested
it
with
his
teeth
to
make
sure
it
was
genuine
he
grunted
his
further
satisfaction
looked
over
the
made
more
secure
the
fastenings
of
the
load
and
taking
the
halter
mounted
and
rode
stolidly
away
toward
the
north
rosa
waited
in
her
covert
until
they
were
far
out
of
sight
then
made
her
way
hurriedly
back
to
the
house
and
climbed
to
a
window
where
she
could
watch
the
trail
for
several
miles
there
with
a
she
kept
watch
until
the
procession
had
filed
across
the
plains
down
into
a
valley
up
over
a
hill
and
dropped
to
a
farther
valley
out
of
sight
she
looked
at
the
sun
and
drew
a
breath
of
satisfaction
she
had
done
it
at
last
she
had
got
margaret
away
before
forsythe
came
there
was
no
likelihood
that
the
fraud
would
be
discovered
until
her
rival
was
far
enough
away
to
be
safe
a
kind
of
reaction
came
upon
rosa
overwrought
nerves
she
laughed
out
harshly
and
her
voice
had
a
cruel
ring
to
it
then
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
and
burst
into
a
passionate
fit
of
weeping
and
so
by
and
by
fell
asleep
she
dreamed
that
margaret
had
returned
like
a
shining
fiery
angel
a
sword
in
her
hand
and
all
the
wallis
camp
at
her
heels
with
vengeance
in
their
wake
that
hateful
little
boy
bud
tanner
danced
around
and
made
faces
at
her
while
forsythe
had
forgotten
her
to
gaze
at
margaret
face
chapter
xxix
to
margaret
the
day
was
very
fair
and
the
omens
all
auspicious
she
carried
with
her
close
to
her
heart
two
precious
letters
received
that
morning
and
scarcely
glanced
at
as
yet
one
from
gardley
and
one
from
her
mother
she
had
had
only
time
to
open
them
and
be
sure
that
all
was
well
with
her
dear
ones
and
had
left
the
rest
to
read
on
the
way
she
was
dressed
in
the
khaki
she
always
wore
when
she
went
on
horseback
and
in
the
bag
strapped
on
behind
she
carried
a
couple
of
fresh
white
blouses
a
thin
white
dress
a
little
soft
dark
silk
gown
that
folded
away
almost
into
a
cobweb
and
a
few
other
necessities
she
had
also
slipped
in
a
new
book
her
mother
had
sent
her
into
which
she
had
had
as
yet
no
time
to
look
and
her
chessmen
and
board
besides
writing
materials
she
prided
herself
on
having
got
so
many
necessaries
into
so
small
a
compass
she
would
need
the
extra
clothing
if
she
stayed
at
ganado
with
the
missionaries
for
a
week
on
her
return
from
the
trip
and
the
book
and
chessmen
would
amuse
them
all
by
the
way
she
had
heard
brownleigh
say
he
loved
to
play
chess
margaret
rode
on
the
familiar
trail
and
for
the
first
hour
just
let
herself
be
glad
that
school
was
over
and
she
could
rest
and
have
no
responsibility
the
sun
shimmered
down
brilliantly
on
the
white
hot
sand
and
of
the
greasewood
and
tall
spikes
of
cactus
like
lonely
spires
shot
up
now
and
again
to
vary
the
scene
it
was
all
familiar
ground
to
margaret
around
here
for
she
had
taken
many
rides
with
gardley
and
bud
and
for
the
first
part
of
the
way
every
turn
and
bit
of
view
was
fraught
with
pleasant
memories
that
brought
a
smile
to
her
eyes
as
she
recalled
some
quotation
of
gardley
or
some
prank
of
bud
here
was
where
they
first
sighted
the
little
cottontail
the
day
she
took
her
initial
ride
on
her
own
pony
off
there
was
the
mountain
where
they
saw
the
sun
drawing
silver
water
above
a
frowning
storm
yonder
was
the
group
of
cedars
where
they
had
stopped
to
eat
their
lunch
once
and
this
they
were
approaching
was
the
one
where
gardley
had
given
her
a
drink
from
his
hat
she
was
almost
glad
that
bud
was
not
along
for
she
was
too
tired
to
talk
and
liked
to
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
for
this
few
minutes
poor
bud
he
would
be
disappointed
when
he
got
back
to
find
her
gone
but
then
he
had
expected
she
was
going
in
a
few
days
anyway
and
she
had
promised
to
take
long
rides
with
him
when
she
returned
she
had
left
a
little
note
for
him
asking
him
to
read
a
certain
book
in
her
bookcase
while
she
was
gone
and
be
ready
to
discuss
it
with
her
when
she
got
back
and
bud
would
be
fascinated
with
it
she
knew
bud
had
been
dear
and
faithful
and
she
would
miss
him
but
just
for
this
little
while
she
was
glad
to
have
the
great
to
herself
she
was
practically
alone
the
two
figures
riding
ahead
of
her
made
no
sign
but
stolidly
rode
on
hour
after
hour
nor
turned
their
heads
even
to
see
if
she
were
coming
she
knew
that
indians
were
this
way
still
as
the
time
went
by
she
began
to
feel
an
uneasy
sense
of
being
alone
in
the
universe
with
a
couple
of
bronze
statues
even
the
papoose
had
erased
itself
in
sleep
and
when
it
awoke
partook
so
fully
of
its
racial
peculiarities
as
to
hold
its
little
peace
and
make
no
fuss
margaret
began
to
feel
the
baby
was
hardly
human
more
like
a
little
brown
doll
set
up
in
a
missionary
meeting
to
teach
white
children
what
a
papoose
was
like
by
and
by
she
got
out
her
letters
and
read
them
over
carefully
dreaming
and
smiling
over
them
and
getting
precious
bits
by
heart
gardley
hinted
that
he
might
be
able
very
soon
to
visit
her
parents
as
it
looked
as
though
he
might
have
to
make
a
trip
on
business
in
their
direction
before
he
could
go
further
with
what
he
was
doing
in
his
old
home
he
gave
no
hint
of
soon
returning
to
the
west
he
said
he
was
awaiting
the
return
of
one
man
who
might
soon
be
coming
from
abroad
margaret
sighed
and
wondered
how
many
weary
months
it
would
be
before
she
would
see
him
perhaps
after
all
she
ought
to
have
gone
home
and
stayed
them
out
with
her
mother
and
father
if
the
could
be
made
to
see
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
no
summer
session
perhaps
she
would
even
yet
go
when
she
returned
from
the
brownleighs
she
would
see
she
would
decide
nothing
until
she
was
rested
suddenly
she
felt
herself
overwhelmingly
weary
and
wished
that
the
indians
would
stop
and
rest
for
a
while
but
when
she
stirred
up
her
sleepy
pony
and
spurred
ahead
to
broach
the
matter
to
her
guide
he
shook
his
solemn
head
and
pointed
to
the
sun
no
get
keams
good
time
no
meet
aneshodi
aneshodi
she
knew
was
the
indians
name
for
the
missionary
and
she
smiled
her
acquiescence
of
course
they
must
meet
the
brownleighs
and
not
detain
them
what
was
it
hazel
had
said
about
having
to
hurry
she
searched
her
pocket
for
the
letter
and
then
remembered
she
had
left
it
with
tanner
what
a
pity
she
had
not
brought
it
perhaps
there
was
some
caution
or
advice
in
it
that
she
had
not
taken
note
of
but
then
the
indian
likely
knew
all
about
it
and
she
could
trust
to
him
she
glanced
at
his
stolid
face
and
wished
she
could
make
him
smile
she
cast
a
sunny
smile
at
him
and
said
something
pleasant
about
the
beautiful
day
but
he
only
looked
her
through
as
if
she
were
not
there
and
after
one
or
two
more
attempts
she
fell
back
and
tried
to
talk
to
the
squaw
but
the
squaw
only
looked
stolid
too
and
shook
her
head
she
did
not
seem
friendly
margaret
drew
back
into
her
old
position
and
feasted
her
eyes
upon
the
distant
hills
the
road
was
growing
unfamiliar
now
they
were
crossing
rough
ridges
with
cliffs
of
red
sandstone
and
every
step
of
the
way
was
interesting
yet
margaret
felt
more
and
more
how
much
she
wanted
to
lie
down
and
sleep
and
when
at
last
in
the
dusk
the
indians
halted
not
far
from
a
little
pool
of
rainwater
and
indicated
that
here
they
would
camp
for
the
night
margaret
was
too
weary
to
question
the
decision
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
be
on
the
way
overnight
before
she
met
her
friends
her
knowledge
of
the
way
and
of
distances
was
but
vague
it
is
doubtful
if
she
would
have
ventured
had
she
known
that
she
must
pass
the
night
thus
in
the
company
of
two
strange
savage
creatures
yet
now
that
she
was
here
and
it
was
inevitable
she
would
not
shrink
but
make
the
best
of
it
she
tried
to
be
friendly
once
more
and
offered
to
look
out
for
the
baby
while
the
squaw
gathered
wood
and
made
a
fire
the
indian
was
off
looking
after
the
horses
evidently
expecting
his
wife
to
do
all
the
work
margaret
watched
a
few
minutes
while
pretending
to
play
with
the
baby
who
was
both
sleepy
and
hungry
yet
held
his
emotions
as
stolidly
as
if
he
were
a
grown
person
then
she
decided
to
take
a
hand
in
the
supper
she
was
hungry
and
could
not
bear
that
those
dusky
dirty
hands
should
set
forth
her
food
so
she
went
to
work
cheerfully
giving
directions
as
if
the
indian
woman
understood
her
though
she
very
soon
discovered
that
all
her
talk
was
as
mere
babbling
to
the
other
and
she
might
as
well
hold
her
peace
the
woman
set
a
kettle
of
water
over
the
fire
and
margaret
forestalled
her
next
movement
by
cutting
some
pork
and
putting
it
to
cook
in
a
little
skillet
she
found
among
the
provisions
the
woman
watched
her
solemnly
not
seeming
to
care
and
so
silently
each
went
about
her
own
preparations
the
supper
was
a
silent
affair
and
when
it
was
over
the
squaw
handed
margaret
a
blanket
suddenly
she
understood
that
this
and
this
alone
was
to
be
her
bed
for
the
night
the
earth
was
there
for
a
mattress
and
the
lent
a
partial
shelter
the
canopy
of
stars
was
overhead
a
kind
of
panic
took
possession
of
her
she
stared
at
the
squaw
and
found
herself
longing
to
cry
out
for
help
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
bear
this
awful
silence
of
the
mortals
who
were
her
only
company
yet
her
common
sense
came
to
her
aid
and
she
realized
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
the
best
of
things
so
she
took
the
blanket
and
spreading
it
out
sat
down
upon
it
and
wrapped
it
about
her
shoulders
and
feet
she
would
not
lie
down
until
she
saw
what
the
rest
did
somehow
she
shrank
from
asking
the
bronze
man
how
to
fold
a
blanket
for
a
bed
on
the
ground
she
tried
to
remember
what
gardley
had
told
her
about
folding
the
blanket
bed
so
as
best
to
keep
out
snakes
and
ants
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
snakes
would
she
dare
call
for
help
from
those
stolid
companions
of
hers
if
a
snake
should
attempt
to
molest
her
in
the
night
and
would
she
ever
dare
to
go
to
sleep
she
remembered
her
first
night
in
arizona
out
among
the
stars
alone
on
the
and
her
first
frenzy
of
loneliness
was
this
as
bad
no
for
these
indians
were
trustworthy
and
well
known
by
her
dear
friends
it
might
be
unpleasant
but
this
too
would
pass
and
the
morrow
would
soon
be
here
the
dusk
dropped
down
and
the
stars
loomed
out
all
the
world
grew
wonderful
like
a
blue
jeweled
dome
of
a
palace
with
the
lights
turned
low
the
fire
burned
brightly
as
the
man
threw
sticks
upon
it
and
the
two
indians
moved
stealthily
about
in
the
darkness
passing
silhouetted
before
the
fire
this
way
and
that
and
then
at
last
lying
down
wrapped
in
their
blankets
to
sleep
it
was
very
quiet
about
her
the
air
was
so
still
she
could
hear
the
hobbled
horses
munching
away
in
the
distance
and
moving
now
and
then
with
the
halting
gait
a
hobble
gives
a
horse
off
in
the
farther
distance
the
howl
of
the
coyotes
rose
but
margaret
was
used
to
them
and
knew
they
would
not
come
near
a
fire
she
was
growing
very
weary
and
at
last
wrapped
her
blanket
closer
and
lay
down
her
head
pillowed
on
one
corner
of
it
committing
herself
to
her
heavenly
father
and
breathing
a
prayer
for
father
mother
and
lover
she
fell
asleep
it
was
still
almost
dark
when
she
awoke
for
a
moment
she
thought
it
was
still
night
and
the
sunset
was
not
gone
yet
the
clouds
were
so
rosy
tinted
the
squaw
was
standing
by
her
touching
her
shoulder
roughly
and
grunting
something
she
perceived
as
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
summon
back
her
senses
that
she
was
expected
to
get
up
and
eat
breakfast
there
was
a
smell
of
pork
and
coffee
in
the
air
and
there
was
scorched
corn
bread
beside
the
fire
on
a
pan
margaret
got
up
quickly
and
ran
down
to
the
to
get
some
water
dashing
it
in
her
face
and
over
her
arms
and
hands
the
squaw
meanwhile
standing
at
a
little
distance
watching
her
curiously
as
if
she
thought
this
some
kind
of
an
oblation
paid
to
the
white
woman
god
before
she
ate
margaret
pulled
the
out
of
her
hair
letting
it
down
and
combing
it
with
one
of
her
side
combs
twisted
it
up
again
in
its
soft
fluffy
waves
straightened
her
collar
set
on
her
hat
and
was
ready
for
the
day
the
squaw
looked
at
her
with
both
awe
and
contempt
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
stalked
back
to
her
papoose
and
began
preparing
it
for
the
journey
margaret
made
a
hurried
meal
and
was
scarcely
done
before
she
found
her
guides
were
waiting
like
two
pillars
of
the
desert
but
watching
keenly
impatiently
her
every
mouthful
and
anxious
to
be
off
the
sky
was
still
with
the
semblance
of
a
sunset
and
margaret
felt
as
she
mounted
her
pony
and
followed
her
companions
as
if
the
day
was
all
turned
upside
down
she
almost
wondered
whether
she
had
slept
through
a
whole
hours
and
it
were
not
after
all
evening
again
till
by
and
by
the
sun
rose
clear
and
the
wonder
of
the
melted
into
day
the
road
lay
through
and
old
barren
with
rabbits
darting
now
and
then
between
the
rocks
suddenly
from
the
top
of
a
little
hill
they
came
out
to
a
spot
where
they
could
see
far
over
the
desert
forty
miles
away
three
square
flat
hills
or
mesas
looked
like
a
gigantic
train
of
cars
and
the
clear
air
gave
everything
a
strange
vastness
farther
on
beyond
the
mesas
dimly
dawned
the
black
mountains
one
could
even
see
the
shadowed
head
of
round
rock
almost
a
hundred
miles
away
before
them
and
around
was
a
great
plain
of
and
here
and
there
was
a
small
bush
that
the
indians
call
the
weed
that
was
not
scared
margaret
had
learned
all
these
things
during
her
winter
in
arizona
and
keenly
enjoyed
the
vast
splendid
view
spread
before
her
they
passed
several
little
hogans
that
margaret
knew
for
indian
dwellings
a
fine
band
of
ponies
off
in
the
distance
made
an
interesting
spot
on
the
landscape
and
twice
they
passed
bands
of
sheep
she
had
a
feeling
of
great
isolation
from
everything
she
had
ever
known
and
seemed
going
farther
and
farther
from
life
and
all
she
loved
once
she
ventured
to
ask
the
indian
what
time
he
expected
to
meet
her
friends
the
missionaries
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
murmured
something
unintelligible
about
keams
and
pointed
to
the
sun
she
dropped
behind
again
vaguely
uneasy
she
could
not
tell
why
there
seemed
something
so
altogether
sly
and
wary
and
unfriendly
in
the
faces
of
the
two
that
she
almost
wished
she
had
not
come
yet
the
way
was
beautiful
enough
and
nothing
very
unpleasant
was
happening
to
her
once
she
dropped
the
envelope
of
her
mother
letter
and
was
about
to
dismount
and
recover
it
then
some
strange
impulse
made
her
leave
it
on
the
sand
of
the
desert
what
if
they
should
be
lost
and
that
paper
should
guide
them
back
the
notion
stayed
by
her
and
once
in
a
while
she
dropped
other
bits
of
paper
by
the
way
about
noon
the
trail
dropped
off
into
a
cañon
with
high
walls
on
either
side
and
stifling
heat
so
that
she
felt
as
if
she
could
scarcely
stand
it
she
was
glad
when
they
emerged
once
more
and
climbed
to
higher
ground
the
noon
camp
was
a
hasty
affair
for
the
indian
seemed
in
a
hurry
he
scanned
the
horizon
far
and
wide
and
seemed
searching
keenly
for
some
one
or
something
once
they
met
a
lonely
indian
and
he
held
a
muttered
conversation
with
him
pointing
off
ahead
and
gesticulating
angrily
but
the
words
were
unintelligible
to
margaret
her
feeling
of
uneasiness
was
growing
and
yet
she
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
tell
why
and
laid
it
down
to
her
tired
nerves
she
was
beginning
to
think
she
had
been
very
foolish
to
start
on
such
a
long
trip
before
she
had
had
a
chance
to
get
rested
from
her
last
days
of
school
she
longed
to
lie
down
under
a
tree
and
sleep
for
days
toward
night
they
sighted
a
great
blue
mesa
about
fifty
miles
south
and
at
sunset
they
could
just
see
the
san
francisco
peaks
more
than
a
hundred
and
miles
away
margaret
as
she
stopped
her
horse
and
gazed
felt
a
choking
in
her
heart
and
throat
and
a
great
desire
to
cry
the
glory
and
awe
of
the
mountains
mingled
with
her
own
weariness
and
nervous
fear
were
almost
too
much
for
her
she
was
glad
to
get
down
and
eat
a
little
supper
and
go
to
sleep
again
as
she
fell
asleep
she
comforted
herself
with
repeating
over
a
few
precious
words
from
her
bible
the
angel
of
the
lord
encampeth
round
about
them
that
fear
him
and
delivereth
them
thou
wilt
keep
him
in
perfect
peace
whose
mind
is
stayed
on
thee
because
he
trusteth
in
thee
i
will
both
lay
me
down
in
peace
and
sleep
for
thou
lord
only
makest
me
to
dwell
in
safety
the
voice
of
the
coyotes
now
far
now
near
boomed
out
on
the
night
great
stars
shot
dartling
pathways
across
the
heavens
the
fire
snapped
and
crackled
died
down
and
flickered
feebly
but
margaret
slept
tired
out
and
dreamed
the
angels
kept
close
vigil
around
her
lowly
couch
she
did
not
know
what
time
the
stars
disappeared
and
the
rain
began
to
fall
she
was
too
tired
to
notice
the
drops
that
fell
upon
her
face
too
tired
to
hear
the
coyotes
coming
nearer
nearer
yet
in
the
morning
there
lay
one
dead
stretched
not
thirty
feet
from
where
she
lay
the
indian
had
shot
him
through
the
heart
somehow
things
looked
very
dismal
that
morning
in
spite
of
the
brightness
of
the
sun
after
the
rain
she
was
stiff
and
sore
with
lying
in
the
dampness
her
hair
was
wet
her
blanket
was
wet
and
she
woke
without
feeling
rested
almost
the
trip
seemed
more
than
she
could
bear
if
she
could
have
wished
herself
back
that
morning
and
have
stayed
at
tanners
all
summer
she
certainly
would
have
done
it
rather
than
to
be
where
and
how
she
was
the
indians
seemed
excited
the
man
grim
and
forbidding
the
woman
appealing
frightened
anxious
they
were
near
to
keams
cañon
aneshodi
would
be
somewhere
about
the
indian
hoped
to
be
rid
of
his
burden
then
and
travel
on
his
interrupted
journey
he
was
growing
impatient
he
felt
he
had
earned
his
money
but
when
they
tried
to
go
down
keam
cañon
they
found
the
road
all
washed
away
by
flood
and
must
needs
go
a
long
way
around
this
made
the
indian
surly
his
countenance
was
more
forbidding
than
ever
margaret
as
she
watched
him
with
sinking
heart
altered
her
ideas
of
the
indian
as
a
whole
to
suit
the
situation
she
had
always
felt
pity
for
the
poor
indian
whose
land
had
been
seized
and
whose
kindred
had
been
slaughtered
but
this
indian
was
not
an
object
of
pity
he
was
the
most
disagreeable
indian
margaret
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
she
had
felt
it
innately
the
first
time
she
saw
him
but
now
as
the
situation
began
to
bring
him
out
she
knew
that
she
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
him
she
had
a
feeling
that
he
might
scalp
her
if
he
got
tired
of
her
she
began
to
alter
her
opinion
of
hazel
brownleigh
judgment
as
regarded
indians
she
did
not
feel
that
she
would
ever
send
this
indian
to
any
one
for
a
guide
and
say
he
was
perfectly
trustworthy
he
done
anything
very
dreadful
yet
but
she
felt
he
was
going
to
he
had
a
number
of
angry
confabs
with
his
wife
that
morning
at
least
he
did
the
confabbing
and
the
squaw
protested
margaret
gathered
after
a
while
that
it
was
something
about
herself
the
furtive
frightened
glances
that
the
squaw
cast
in
her
direction
sometimes
when
the
man
was
not
looking
made
her
think
so
she
tried
to
say
it
was
all
imagination
and
that
her
nerves
were
getting
the
upper
hand
of
her
but
in
spite
of
her
she
shuddered
sometimes
just
as
she
had
done
when
rosa
looked
at
her
she
decided
that
she
must
be
going
to
have
a
fit
of
sickness
and
that
just
as
soon
as
she
got
in
the
neighborhood
of
tanner
again
she
would
pack
her
trunk
and
go
home
to
her
mother
if
she
was
going
to
be
sick
she
wanted
her
mother
about
noon
things
came
to
a
climax
they
halted
on
the
top
of
the
mesa
and
the
indians
had
another
altercation
which
ended
in
the
man
descending
the
trail
a
fearfully
steep
way
down
four
hundred
feet
to
the
in
the
cañon
margaret
looked
down
and
gasped
and
thanked
a
kind
providence
that
had
not
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
make
that
descent
but
the
squaw
stood
at
the
top
with
her
baby
and
looked
down
in
silent
sorrow
agony
perhaps
would
be
a
better
name
her
face
was
terrible
to
look
upon
margaret
could
not
understand
it
and
she
went
to
the
woman
and
put
her
hand
out
sympathetically
asking
gently
what
is
the
matter
you
poor
little
thing
oh
what
is
it
perhaps
the
woman
understood
the
tenderness
in
the
tone
for
she
suddenly
turned
and
rested
her
forehead
against
margaret
shoulder
giving
one
great
gasping
sob
then
lifted
her
dry
miserable
eyes
to
the
girl
face
as
if
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
margaret
heart
was
touched
she
threw
her
arms
around
the
poor
woman
and
drew
her
papoose
and
all
comfortingly
toward
her
patting
her
shoulder
and
saying
gentle
soothing
words
as
she
would
to
a
little
child
and
by
and
by
the
woman
lifted
her
head
again
the
tears
coursing
down
her
face
and
tried
to
explain
muttering
her
queer
gutturals
and
making
eloquent
gestures
until
margaret
felt
she
understood
she
gathered
that
the
man
had
gone
down
to
the
to
find
the
aneshodi
and
that
the
squaw
feared
that
he
would
somehow
procure
firewater
either
from
the
trader
or
from
some
indian
he
might
meet
and
would
come
back
angrier
than
he
had
gone
and
without
his
money
if
margaret
also
suspected
that
the
indian
had
desired
to
get
rid
of
her
by
leaving
her
at
that
desolate
little
down
in
the
cañon
until
such
time
as
her
friends
should
call
for
her
she
resolutely
put
the
thought
out
of
her
mind
and
set
herself
to
cheer
the
poor
indian
woman
she
took
a
bright
soft
rosy
silk
tie
from
her
own
neck
and
knotted
it
about
the
astonished
woman
dusky
throat
and
then
she
put
a
silver
dollar
in
her
hand
and
was
thrilled
with
wonder
to
see
what
a
change
came
over
the
poor
dark
face
it
reminded
her
of
mom
wallis
when
she
got
on
her
new
bonnet
and
once
again
she
felt
the
thrill
of
knowing
the
whole
world
kin
the
squaw
cheered
up
after
a
little
got
sticks
and
made
a
fire
and
together
they
had
quite
a
pleasant
meal
margaret
exerted
herself
to
make
the
poor
woman
laugh
and
finally
succeeded
by
dangling
a
knight
from
her
chessmen
in
front
of
the
delighted
eyes
till
he
gurgled
out
a
real
baby
crow
of
joy
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
before
the
indian
returned
sitting
crazily
his
struggling
beast
as
he
climbed
the
trail
once
more
margaret
watching
caught
her
breath
and
prayed
was
this
the
trustworthy
man
this
drunken
reeling
creature
clubbing
his
horse
and
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
indistinguishable
gutturals
it
was
evident
that
his
wife
worst
fears
were
verified
he
had
found
the
firewater
the
frightened
squaw
set
to
work
putting
things
together
as
fast
as
she
could
she
well
knew
what
to
expect
and
when
the
man
reached
the
top
of
the
mesa
he
found
his
party
packed
and
mounted
waiting
fearsomely
to
take
the
trail
silently
timorously
they
rode
behind
him
west
across
the
great
wide
plain
in
the
distance
gradually
there
appeared
dim
mesas
like
great
fingers
stretching
out
against
the
sky
miles
away
they
seemed
and
nothing
intervening
but
a
stretch
of
varying
color
where
melted
into
sand
and
and
greasewood
grew
again
with
tall
cactus
startling
here
and
there
like
bayonets
at
rest
but
bristling
with
menace
the
indian
had
grown
silent
and
sullen
his
eyes
were
like
deep
fires
of
burning
volcanoes
one
shrank
from
looking
at
them
his
massive
cruel
profile
stood
out
like
bronze
against
the
evening
sky
it
was
growing
night
again
and
still
they
had
not
come
to
anywhere
or
anything
and
still
her
friends
seemed
just
as
far
away
since
they
had
left
the
top
of
keams
cañon
margaret
had
been
sure
all
was
not
right
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
guide
was
drunk
at
present
she
was
convinced
that
there
had
been
something
wrong
with
him
all
along
he
did
not
act
like
the
indians
around
ashland
he
did
not
act
like
a
trusted
guide
that
her
friends
would
send
for
her
she
wished
once
more
that
she
had
kept
hazel
brownleigh
letter
she
wondered
how
her
friends
would
find
her
if
they
came
after
her
it
was
then
she
began
in
earnest
to
systematically
plan
to
leave
a
trail
behind
her
all
the
rest
of
the
way
if
she
had
only
done
it
thoroughly
when
she
first
began
to
be
uneasy
but
now
she
was
so
far
away
so
many
miles
from
anywhere
oh
if
she
had
not
come
at
all
and
first
she
dropped
her
handkerchief
because
she
happened
to
have
it
in
her
hand
a
dainty
thing
with
lace
on
the
edge
and
her
name
written
in
tiny
script
by
her
mother
careful
hand
on
the
narrow
hem
and
then
after
a
little
as
soon
as
she
could
scrawl
it
without
being
noticed
she
wrote
a
note
which
she
twisted
around
the
neck
of
a
red
chessman
and
left
behind
her
after
that
scraps
of
paper
as
she
could
reach
them
out
of
the
bag
tied
on
behind
her
saddle
then
a
stocking
a
bedroom
slipper
more
chessmen
and
so
when
they
halted
at
dusk
and
prepared
to
strike
camp
she
had
quite
a
good
little
trail
blazed
behind
her
over
that
wide
empty
plain
she
shuddered
as
she
looked
into
the
gathering
darkness
ahead
where
those
long
dark
lines
of
mesas
looked
like
barriers
in
the
way
then
suddenly
the
indian
pointed
ahead
to
the
first
mesa
and
uttered
one
word
walpi
so
that
was
the
indian
village
to
which
she
was
bound
what
was
before
her
on
the
morrow
after
eating
a
pretense
of
supper
she
lay
down
the
indian
had
more
firewater
with
him
he
drank
he
uttered
cruel
gutturals
at
his
squaw
and
even
kicked
the
feet
of
the
sleeping
papoose
as
he
passed
by
till
it
awoke
and
cried
sharply
which
made
him
more
angry
so
he
struck
the
squaw
it
seemed
hours
before
all
was
quiet
margaret
nerves
were
strained
to
such
a
pitch
she
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
but
at
last
when
the
fire
had
almost
died
down
the
man
lay
quiet
and
she
could
relax
and
close
her
eyes
not
to
sleep
she
must
not
go
to
sleep
the
fire
was
almost
gone
and
the
coyotes
would
be
around
she
must
wake
and
watch
that
was
the
last
thought
she
remembered
that
and
a
prayer
that
the
angels
would
keep
watch
once
again
when
she
awoke
it
was
broad
daylight
and
far
into
the
morning
for
the
sun
was
high
overhead
and
the
mesas
in
the
distance
were
clear
and
distinct
against
the
sky
she
sat
up
and
looked
about
her
bewildered
not
knowing
at
first
where
she
was
it
was
so
still
and
wide
and
lonely
she
turned
to
find
the
indians
but
there
was
no
trace
of
them
anywhere
the
fire
lay
smoldering
in
its
place
a
thin
trickle
of
smoke
curling
away
from
a
dying
stick
but
that
was
all
a
tin
cup
half
full
of
coffee
was
beside
the
stick
and
a
piece
of
blackened
corn
bread
she
turned
frightened
eyes
to
east
to
west
to
north
to
south
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
and
out
over
the
distant
mesa
there
poised
a
great
eagle
alone
in
the
vast
sky
keeping
watch
over
the
brilliant
silent
waste
chapter
xxx
when
margaret
was
a
very
little
girl
her
father
and
mother
had
left
her
alone
for
an
hour
with
a
stranger
while
they
went
out
to
make
a
call
in
a
strange
city
through
which
they
were
passing
on
a
summer
trip
the
stranger
was
kind
and
gave
to
the
child
a
large
green
box
of
bits
of
old
black
lace
and
purple
ribbons
to
play
with
but
she
turned
sorrowfully
from
the
somber
array
of
finery
which
was
the
only
thing
in
the
way
of
a
plaything
the
woman
had
at
hand
and
stood
looking
drearily
out
of
the
window
on
the
strange
new
town
a
feeling
of
utter
loneliness
upon
her
her
little
heart
was
almost
choked
with
the
awfulness
of
the
thought
that
she
was
a
human
atom
drifted
apart
from
every
other
atom
she
had
ever
known
that
she
had
a
personality
and
a
responsibility
of
her
own
and
that
she
must
face
this
thought
of
herself
and
her
aloneness
for
evermore
it
was
the
child
first
realization
that
she
was
a
separate
being
apart
from
her
father
and
mother
and
she
was
almost
consumed
with
the
terror
of
it
as
she
rose
now
from
her
bed
on
the
ground
and
looked
out
across
that
vast
waste
in
which
the
only
other
living
creature
was
that
sinister
watching
eagle
the
same
feeling
returned
to
her
and
made
her
tremble
like
the
little
child
who
had
turned
from
her
box
of
ancient
finery
to
realize
her
own
little
self
and
its
terrible
aloneness
for
an
instant
even
her
realization
of
god
which
had
from
early
childhood
been
present
with
her
seemed
to
have
departed
she
could
not
grasp
anything
save
the
vast
empty
silence
that
loomed
about
her
so
awfully
she
was
alone
and
about
as
far
from
anywhere
or
anything
as
she
could
possibly
be
in
the
state
of
arizona
would
she
ever
get
back
to
human
habitations
would
her
friends
ever
be
able
to
find
her
then
her
heart
flew
back
to
its
habitual
refuge
and
she
spoke
aloud
and
said
god
is
here
and
the
thought
seemed
to
comfort
her
she
looked
about
once
more
on
the
bright
waste
and
now
it
did
not
seem
so
dreary
god
is
here
she
repeated
and
tried
to
realize
that
this
was
a
part
of
his
habitation
she
could
not
be
lost
where
god
was
he
knew
the
way
out
she
had
only
to
trust
so
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
in
the
sand
and
prayed
for
trust
and
courage
when
she
rose
again
she
walked
steadily
to
a
height
a
little
above
the
and
shading
her
eyes
looked
carefully
in
every
direction
no
there
was
not
a
sign
of
her
recent
companions
they
must
have
stolen
away
in
the
night
quite
soon
after
she
fell
asleep
and
have
gone
fast
and
far
so
that
they
were
now
beyond
the
reach
of
her
eyes
and
not
anywhere
was
there
sign
of
living
thing
save
that
eagle
still
sweeping
in
great
curves
and
poising
again
above
the
distant
mesa
where
was
her
horse
had
the
indians
taken
that
too
she
searched
the
valley
but
saw
no
horse
at
first
with
sinking
heart
she
went
back
to
where
her
things
were
and
sat
down
by
the
dying
fire
to
think
putting
a
few
loose
twigs
and
sticks
together
to
keep
the
embers
bright
while
she
could
she
reflected
that
she
had
no
matches
and
this
was
probably
the
last
fire
she
would
have
until
somebody
came
to
her
rescue
or
she
got
somewhere
by
herself
what
was
she
to
do
stay
right
where
she
was
or
start
out
on
foot
and
should
she
go
backward
or
forward
surely
surely
the
brownleighs
would
miss
her
pretty
soon
and
send
out
a
for
her
how
could
it
be
that
they
trusted
an
indian
who
had
done
such
a
cruel
thing
as
to
leave
a
woman
unprotected
in
the
desert
and
yet
perhaps
they
did
not
know
his
temptation
to
drink
perhaps
they
had
thought
he
could
not
get
any
firewater
perhaps
he
would
return
when
he
came
to
himself
and
realized
what
he
had
done
and
now
she
noticed
what
she
had
not
seen
at
first
a
small
bottle
of
water
on
a
stone
beside
the
blackened
bread
realizing
that
she
was
very
hungry
and
that
this
was
the
only
food
at
hand
she
sat
down
beside
the
fire
to
eat
the
dry
bread
and
drink
the
miserable
coffee
she
must
have
strength
to
do
whatever
was
before
her
she
tried
not
to
think
how
her
mother
would
feel
if
she
never
came
back
how
anxious
they
would
be
as
they
waited
day
by
day
for
her
letters
that
did
not
come
she
reflected
with
a
sinking
heart
that
she
had
just
before
leaving
written
a
hasty
note
to
her
mother
telling
her
not
to
expect
anything
for
several
days
perhaps
even
as
much
as
two
weeks
as
she
was
going
out
of
civilization
for
a
little
while
how
had
she
unwittingly
sealed
her
fate
by
that
for
now
not
even
by
way
of
her
alarmed
home
could
help
come
to
her
she
put
the
last
bit
of
hard
corn
bread
in
her
pocket
for
a
further
time
of
need
and
began
to
look
about
her
again
then
she
spied
with
delight
a
moving
object
far
below
her
in
the
valley
and
decided
it
was
a
horse
perhaps
her
own
he
was
a
mile
away
at
least
but
he
was
there
and
she
cried
out
with
sudden
joy
and
relief
she
went
over
to
her
blanket
and
bags
which
had
been
beside
her
during
the
night
and
stood
a
moment
trying
to
think
what
to
do
should
she
carry
the
things
to
the
horse
or
risk
leaving
them
here
while
she
went
after
the
horse
and
brought
him
to
the
things
no
that
would
not
be
safe
some
one
might
come
along
and
take
them
or
she
might
not
be
able
to
find
her
way
back
again
in
this
strange
wild
waste
besides
she
might
not
get
the
horse
after
all
and
would
lose
everything
she
must
carry
her
things
to
the
horse
she
stooped
to
gather
them
up
and
something
bright
beside
her
bag
attracted
her
it
was
the
sun
shining
on
the
silver
dollar
she
had
given
to
the
indian
woman
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
came
to
her
eyes
the
poor
creature
had
tried
to
make
all
the
reparation
she
could
for
thus
hastily
leaving
the
white
woman
in
the
desert
she
had
given
back
the
money
all
she
had
that
was
valuable
beside
the
dollar
rippled
a
little
chain
of
beads
curiously
wrought
an
inanimate
appeal
for
forgiveness
and
a
grateful
return
for
the
kindness
shown
her
margaret
smiled
as
she
stooped
again
to
pick
up
her
things
there
had
been
a
heart
after
all
behind
that
stolid
countenance
and
some
sense
of
righteousness
and
justice
margaret
decided
that
indians
were
not
all
treacherous
poor
woman
what
a
life
was
hers
to
follow
her
grim
lord
whither
he
would
lead
even
as
her
white
sister
must
sometimes
sorrowing
rebelling
crying
out
but
following
she
wondered
if
into
the
heart
of
this
dark
sister
there
ever
crept
any
of
the
rebellion
which
led
some
of
her
white
sisters
to
cry
aloud
for
rights
and
emancipation
but
it
was
all
a
passing
thought
to
be
remembered
and
turned
over
at
a
more
propitious
time
margaret
whole
thoughts
now
were
bent
on
her
present
predicament
the
packing
was
short
work
she
stuffed
everything
into
the
two
bags
that
were
usually
hung
across
the
horse
and
settled
them
carefully
across
her
shoulders
then
she
rolled
the
blanket
took
it
in
her
arms
and
started
it
was
a
heavy
burden
to
carry
but
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
part
with
any
of
her
things
until
she
had
at
least
made
an
effort
to
save
them
if
she
should
be
left
alone
in
the
desert
for
the
night
the
blanket
was
indispensable
and
her
clothes
would
at
least
do
to
drop
as
a
trail
by
which
her
friends
might
find
her
she
must
carry
them
as
far
as
possible
so
she
started
it
was
already
high
day
and
the
sun
was
intolerably
hot
her
heavy
burden
was
not
only
cumbersome
but
very
warm
and
she
felt
her
strength
going
from
her
as
she
went
but
her
nerve
was
up
and
her
courage
was
strong
moreover
she
prayed
as
she
walked
and
she
felt
now
the
presence
of
her
guide
and
was
not
afraid
as
she
walked
she
faced
a
number
of
possibilities
in
the
immediate
future
which
were
startling
and
to
say
the
least
undesirable
there
were
wild
animals
in
this
land
not
so
much
in
the
daylight
but
what
of
the
night
she
had
heard
that
a
woman
was
always
safe
in
that
wild
western
land
but
what
of
the
prowling
indians
what
of
a
possible
exception
to
the
western
rule
of
chivalry
toward
a
decent
woman
one
small
piece
of
corn
bread
and
less
than
a
pint
of
water
were
small
provision
on
which
to
withstand
a
siege
how
far
was
it
to
anywhere
it
was
then
she
remembered
for
the
first
time
that
one
word
walpi
uttered
by
the
indian
as
he
came
to
a
halt
the
night
before
and
pointed
far
to
the
mesa
walpi
she
lifted
her
eyes
now
and
scanned
the
dark
mesa
it
loomed
like
a
great
battlement
of
rock
against
the
sky
could
it
be
possible
there
were
people
dwelling
there
she
had
heard
of
course
about
the
curious
hopi
villages
each
village
a
gigantic
house
of
many
rooms
called
pueblos
built
upon
the
lofty
crags
sometimes
five
or
six
hundred
feet
above
the
desert
could
it
be
that
that
great
outline
against
the
sky
before
her
standing
out
on
the
end
of
the
mesa
like
a
promontory
above
the
sea
was
walpi
and
if
it
was
how
was
she
to
get
up
there
the
rock
rose
sheer
and
steep
from
the
desert
floor
the
narrow
neck
of
land
behind
it
looked
like
a
slender
thread
her
heart
sank
at
thought
of
trying
to
storm
and
enter
such
an
impregnable
fortress
and
yet
if
her
friends
were
there
perhaps
they
would
see
her
when
she
drew
near
and
come
to
show
her
the
way
strange
that
they
should
have
gone
on
and
left
her
with
those
treacherous
indians
strange
that
they
should
have
trusted
them
so
in
the
first
place
her
own
instincts
had
been
against
trusting
the
man
from
the
beginning
it
must
be
confessed
that
during
her
reflections
at
this
point
her
opinion
of
the
wisdom
and
judgment
of
the
brownleighs
was
lowered
several
notches
then
she
began
to
berate
herself
for
having
so
easily
been
satisfied
about
her
escort
she
should
have
read
the
letter
more
carefully
she
should
have
asked
the
indians
more
questions
she
should
perhaps
have
asked
jasper
kemp
advice
or
got
him
to
talk
to
the
indian
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
for
bud
now
if
bud
were
along
he
would
be
saying
some
comical
and
be
finding
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
dear
faithful
bud
the
sun
rose
higher
and
the
morning
grew
hotter
as
she
descended
to
the
valley
her
burdens
grew
intolerable
and
several
times
she
almost
cast
them
aside
once
she
lost
sight
of
her
pony
among
the
and
it
was
two
hours
before
she
came
to
him
and
was
able
to
capture
him
and
strap
on
her
burdens
she
was
almost
too
exhausted
to
climb
into
the
saddle
when
all
was
ready
but
she
managed
to
mount
at
last
and
started
out
toward
the
rugged
crag
ahead
of
her
the
pony
had
a
long
hot
climb
out
of
the
valley
to
a
hill
where
she
could
see
very
far
again
but
still
that
vast
emptiness
reigned
even
the
eagle
had
disappeared
and
she
fancied
he
must
be
resting
like
a
great
emblem
of
freedom
on
one
of
the
points
of
the
battlement
against
the
sky
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
and
she
was
the
only
one
left
in
the
universe
forgotten
riding
on
her
weary
horse
across
an
endless
desert
in
search
of
a
home
she
would
never
see
again
below
the
hill
there
stretched
a
wide
white
strip
of
sand
perhaps
two
miles
in
extent
but
shimmering
in
the
sun
and
seeming
to
recede
ahead
of
her
as
she
advanced
beyond
was
soft
greenness
something
growing
not
near
enough
to
be
discerned
as
cornfields
the
girl
drooped
her
tired
head
upon
her
horse
mane
and
wept
her
courage
going
from
her
with
her
tears
in
all
that
wide
universe
there
seemed
no
way
to
go
and
she
was
so
very
tired
hungry
hot
and
discouraged
there
was
always
that
bit
of
bread
in
her
pocket
and
that
warm
water
for
a
last
resort
but
she
must
save
them
as
long
as
possible
for
there
was
no
telling
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
had
more
there
was
no
trail
now
to
follow
she
had
started
from
the
spot
where
she
had
found
the
horse
and
her
inexperienced
eyes
could
not
have
searched
out
a
trail
if
she
had
tried
she
was
going
toward
that
distant
castle
on
the
crag
as
to
a
goal
but
when
she
reached
it
if
she
ever
did
would
she
find
anything
there
but
crags
and
lonesomeness
and
the
eagle
drying
her
tears
at
last
she
started
the
horse
on
down
the
hill
and
perhaps
her
tears
blinded
her
or
because
she
was
dizzy
with
hunger
and
the
long
stretch
of
anxiety
and
fatigue
she
was
not
looking
closely
there
was
a
steep
place
a
sharp
falling
away
of
the
ground
unexpectedly
as
they
emerged
from
a
thicket
of
and
the
horse
plunged
several
feet
down
striking
sharply
on
some
loose
rocks
and
slipping
to
his
knees
snorting
scrambling
making
brave
effort
but
slipping
half
rolling
at
last
he
was
brought
down
with
his
frightened
rider
and
lay
upon
his
side
with
her
foot
under
him
and
a
sensation
like
a
knife
running
through
her
ankle
margaret
caught
her
breath
in
quick
gasps
as
they
fell
lifting
a
prayer
in
her
heart
for
help
then
came
the
crash
and
the
sharp
pain
and
with
a
quick
conviction
that
all
was
over
she
dropped
back
unconscious
on
the
sand
a
blessed
oblivion
of
darkness
rushing
over
her
when
she
came
to
herself
once
more
the
hot
sun
was
pouring
down
upon
her
unprotected
face
and
she
was
conscious
of
intense
pain
and
suffering
in
every
part
of
her
body
she
opened
her
eyes
wildly
and
looked
around
there
was
up
above
waving
over
the
crag
down
which
they
had
fallen
its
shimmering
hotly
in
the
sun
the
sky
was
mercilessly
blue
without
a
cloud
the
great
beast
heavy
and
quivering
lay
solidly
against
her
half
pinning
her
to
earth
and
the
helplessness
of
her
position
was
like
an
awful
nightmare
from
which
she
felt
she
might
waken
if
she
could
only
cry
out
but
when
at
last
she
raised
her
voice
its
empty
echo
frightened
her
and
there
above
her
with
wings
circling
for
an
instant
then
poised
in
motionless
survey
of
her
with
cruel
eyes
upon
her
loomed
that
eagle
so
large
so
fearful
so
suggestive
in
its
curious
stare
the
monarch
of
the
desert
come
to
see
who
had
invaded
his
precincts
and
fallen
into
one
of
his
snares
with
sudden
frenzy
burning
in
her
veins
margaret
struggled
and
tried
to
get
free
but
she
could
only
move
the
slightest
bit
each
time
and
every
motion
was
an
agony
to
the
hurt
ankle
it
seemed
hours
before
she
writhed
herself
free
from
that
great
motionless
horse
whose
labored
breath
only
showed
that
he
was
still
alive
something
terrible
must
have
happened
to
the
horse
or
he
would
have
tried
to
rise
for
she
had
coaxed
patted
cajoled
tried
in
every
way
to
rouse
him
when
at
last
she
crawled
free
from
the
hot
horrible
body
and
crept
with
pained
progress
around
in
front
of
him
she
saw
that
both
his
forelegs
lay
limp
and
helpless
he
must
have
broken
them
in
falling
poor
fellow
he
too
was
suffering
and
she
had
nothing
to
give
him
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
for
him
then
she
thought
of
the
bottle
of
water
but
searching
for
it
found
that
her
good
intention
of
dividing
it
with
him
was
useless
for
the
bottle
was
broken
and
the
water
already
soaked
into
the
sand
only
a
damp
spot
on
the
showed
where
it
had
departed
then
indeed
did
margaret
sink
down
in
the
sand
in
despair
and
begin
to
pray
as
she
had
never
prayed
before
chapter
xxxi
the
morning
after
margaret
departure
rosa
awoke
with
no
feelings
of
but
rather
a
great
exultation
at
the
way
in
which
she
had
been
able
to
get
rid
of
her
rival
she
lay
for
a
few
minutes
thinking
of
forsythe
and
trying
to
decide
what
she
would
wear
when
she
went
forth
to
meet
him
for
she
wanted
to
charm
him
as
she
had
never
charmed
any
one
before
she
spent
some
time
arraying
herself
in
different
costumes
but
at
last
decided
on
her
commencement
gown
of
fine
white
organdie
and
frilled
with
filmy
lace
the
product
of
a
famous
house
of
gowns
in
the
eastern
city
where
she
had
attended
school
for
a
while
and
acquired
expensive
tastes
daintily
slippered
beribboned
with
girdle
and
with
a
rose
from
the
vine
over
her
window
in
her
hair
she
sallied
forth
at
last
to
the
forsythe
was
a
whole
hour
late
as
became
a
languid
gentleman
who
had
traveled
the
day
before
and
idled
at
his
sister
house
over
a
late
breakfast
until
nearly
noon
already
his
fluttering
fancy
was
apathetic
about
rosa
and
he
wondered
as
he
rode
along
what
had
become
of
the
interesting
young
teacher
who
had
charmed
him
for
more
than
a
passing
moment
would
he
dare
to
call
upon
her
now
that
gardley
was
out
of
the
way
was
she
still
in
ashland
or
had
she
gone
home
for
vacation
he
must
ask
rosa
about
her
then
he
came
in
sight
of
rosa
sitting
picturesquely
in
the
shade
of
an
old
cedar
reading
poetry
a
little
lady
in
the
wilderness
and
he
forgot
everything
else
in
his
delight
over
the
change
in
her
for
rosa
had
changed
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
she
had
bloomed
out
into
maturity
in
those
few
short
months
of
his
absence
her
soft
figure
had
rounded
and
developed
her
bewitching
curls
were
put
up
on
her
head
with
only
a
stray
tendril
here
and
there
to
emphasize
a
dainty
ear
or
call
attention
to
a
smooth
round
neck
and
when
she
raised
her
lovely
head
and
lifted
limpid
eyes
to
his
there
was
about
her
a
demureness
a
coolness
and
charm
that
he
had
fancied
only
ladies
of
the
city
could
attain
oh
rosa
knew
her
charms
and
had
practised
many
a
day
before
her
mirror
till
she
had
appraised
the
value
of
every
curving
eyelash
every
hidden
dimple
every
cupid
curve
of
lip
rosa
had
watched
well
and
learned
from
all
with
whom
she
had
come
in
contact
no
woman
guile
was
left
untried
by
her
and
rosa
was
very
sweet
and
charming
she
knew
just
when
to
lift
up
innocent
eyes
of
wonder
when
to
not
understand
suggestions
when
to
exclaim
softly
with
delight
or
shrink
with
shyness
that
nevertheless
did
not
repulse
forsythe
studied
her
with
wonder
and
delight
no
maiden
of
the
city
had
ever
charmed
him
more
and
withal
she
seemed
so
innocent
and
young
so
altogether
pliable
in
his
hands
his
pulses
beat
high
his
heart
was
inflamed
and
passion
came
and
sat
within
his
handsome
eyes
it
was
easy
to
persuade
her
after
her
first
seemingly
shy
reserve
was
overcome
and
before
an
hour
was
passed
she
had
promised
to
go
away
with
him
he
had
very
little
money
but
what
of
that
when
he
spoke
of
that
feature
rosa
declared
she
could
easily
get
some
her
father
gave
her
free
access
to
his
safe
and
kept
her
plentifully
supplied
for
the
household
use
it
was
nothing
to
her
a
passing
incident
what
should
it
matter
whose
money
took
them
on
their
way
when
she
went
demurely
back
to
the
ranch
a
little
before
sunset
she
thought
she
was
very
happy
poor
little
silly
sinner
she
met
her
father
with
her
most
alluring
but
most
furtive
smile
she
was
charming
at
supper
and
blushed
as
her
mother
used
to
do
when
he
praised
her
new
gown
and
told
her
how
well
she
looked
in
it
but
she
professed
to
be
weary
yet
from
the
last
days
of
school
to
have
a
headache
and
so
she
went
early
to
her
room
and
asked
that
the
servants
keep
the
house
quiet
in
the
morning
that
she
might
sleep
late
and
get
really
rested
her
father
kissed
her
tenderly
and
thought
what
a
dear
child
she
was
and
what
a
comfort
to
his
ripening
years
and
the
house
settled
down
into
quiet
rosa
packed
a
bag
with
some
of
her
most
elaborate
garments
arrayed
herself
in
a
charming
little
outfit
of
silk
for
the
journey
dropped
her
baggage
out
of
the
window
and
when
the
moon
rose
and
the
household
were
quietly
sleeping
she
paid
a
visit
to
her
father
safe
and
then
stole
forth
taking
her
shadowy
way
to
the
trail
by
a
winding
route
known
well
to
herself
and
secure
from
the
watch
of
vigilant
servants
who
were
ever
on
the
lookout
for
cattle
thieves
thus
she
left
her
father
house
and
went
forth
to
put
her
trust
in
a
man
whose
promises
were
as
ropes
of
sand
and
whose
fancy
was
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
tossed
to
and
fro
by
every
breath
that
blew
long
ere
the
sun
rose
the
next
morning
the
guarded
beloved
child
was
as
far
from
her
safe
home
and
her
father
sheltering
love
as
if
alone
she
had
started
for
the
mouth
of
the
bottomless
pit
two
days
later
while
margaret
lay
unconscious
beneath
the
with
a
hovering
eagle
for
watch
rosa
in
the
streets
of
a
great
city
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
more
alone
in
the
universe
than
ever
she
could
have
been
in
a
wide
desert
and
her
plight
was
far
worse
than
the
girl
with
whose
fate
she
had
so
lightly
played
quite
early
on
the
morning
after
rosa
left
while
the
household
was
still
keeping
quiet
for
the
supposed
sleeper
gardley
rode
into
the
inclosure
about
the
house
and
asked
for
rogers
gardley
had
been
traveling
night
and
day
to
get
back
matters
had
suddenly
arranged
themselves
so
that
he
could
finish
up
his
business
at
his
old
home
and
go
on
to
see
margaret
father
and
mother
and
he
had
made
his
visit
there
and
hurried
back
to
arizona
hoping
to
reach
ashland
in
time
for
commencement
a
delay
on
account
of
a
washout
on
the
road
had
brought
him
back
two
days
late
for
commencement
he
had
ridden
to
camp
from
a
junction
forty
miles
away
to
get
there
the
sooner
and
this
morning
had
ridden
straight
to
the
tanners
to
surprise
margaret
it
was
therefore
a
deep
disappointment
to
find
her
gone
and
only
tanner
voluble
explanations
for
comfort
tanner
exhausted
her
vocabulary
in
trying
to
describe
the
injuns
her
own
feeling
of
protest
against
them
and
brownleigh
foolishness
in
making
so
much
of
them
and
then
she
bustled
in
to
the
old
pine
desk
in
the
and
produced
the
letter
that
had
started
margaret
off
as
soon
as
commencement
was
over
gardley
took
the
letter
eagerly
as
though
it
were
something
to
connect
him
with
margaret
and
read
it
through
carefully
to
make
sure
just
how
matters
stood
he
had
looked
troubled
when
tanner
told
how
tired
margaret
was
and
how
worried
she
seemed
about
her
school
and
glad
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
he
agreed
that
the
trip
was
probably
a
good
thing
i
wish
bud
could
have
gone
along
though
he
said
thoughtfully
as
he
turned
away
from
the
door
i
do
like
her
to
go
with
just
indians
though
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
you
say
he
had
his
wife
and
child
along
of
course
brownleigh
would
send
anybody
that
perfectly
all
right
well
i
suppose
the
trip
will
be
a
rest
for
her
i
sorry
i
did
get
home
a
few
days
sooner
i
might
have
looked
out
for
her
myself
he
rode
away
from
the
tanners
promising
to
return
later
with
a
gift
he
had
brought
for
bud
that
he
wanted
to
present
himself
and
tanner
bustled
back
to
her
work
again
well
i
glad
he
got
home
anyway
she
remarked
aloud
to
herself
as
she
hung
her
tidily
over
the
upturned
and
took
up
her
broom
i
felt
noways
easy
her
sence
she
left
though
i
do
suppose
there
ai
any
sense
to
it
but
i
he
meantime
gardley
was
riding
toward
rogers
ranch
meditating
whether
he
should
venture
to
follow
the
expedition
and
enjoy
at
least
the
return
trip
with
margaret
or
whether
he
ought
to
remain
patiently
until
she
came
back
and
go
to
work
at
once
there
was
nothing
really
important
demanding
his
attention
immediately
for
rogers
had
arranged
to
keep
the
present
overseer
of
affairs
until
he
was
ready
to
undertake
the
work
he
was
on
his
way
now
to
report
on
a
small
business
matter
which
he
had
been
attending
to
in
new
york
for
rogers
when
that
was
over
he
would
be
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
for
a
few
days
more
if
he
liked
and
the
temptation
was
great
to
go
at
once
to
margaret
as
he
stood
waiting
beside
his
horse
in
front
of
the
house
while
the
servant
went
to
call
rogers
he
looked
about
with
delight
on
the
beauty
of
the
day
how
glad
he
was
to
be
back
in
arizona
again
was
it
the
charm
of
the
place
or
because
margaret
was
there
he
wondered
that
he
felt
so
happy
by
all
means
he
must
follow
her
why
should
he
not
he
looked
at
the
clambering
that
covered
one
end
of
the
house
and
noticed
how
it
crept
close
to
the
window
casement
and
caressed
the
white
curtain
as
it
blew
margaret
must
have
such
a
vine
at
her
window
in
the
house
he
would
build
for
her
it
might
be
but
a
modest
house
that
he
could
give
her
now
but
it
should
have
a
just
like
that
and
he
would
train
it
round
her
window
where
she
could
smell
the
fragrance
from
it
every
morning
when
she
awoke
and
where
it
would
breathe
upon
her
as
she
slept
margaret
how
impatient
he
was
to
see
her
again
to
look
upon
her
dear
face
and
know
that
she
was
his
that
her
father
and
mother
had
been
satisfied
about
him
and
sent
their
blessing
and
he
might
tell
her
so
it
was
wonderful
his
heart
thrilled
with
the
thought
of
it
of
course
he
would
go
to
her
at
once
he
would
start
as
soon
as
rogers
was
through
with
him
he
would
go
to
ganado
no
keams
which
was
it
he
drew
the
letter
out
of
his
pocket
and
read
it
again
then
replaced
it
the
fluttering
curtain
up
at
the
window
blew
out
and
in
and
when
it
blew
out
again
it
brought
with
it
a
flurry
of
papers
like
white
leaves
the
curtain
had
knocked
over
a
or
vase
or
something
that
held
them
and
set
the
papers
free
the
breeze
caught
them
and
flung
them
about
erratically
tossing
one
almost
at
his
feet
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
thinking
it
might
be
of
value
to
some
one
and
caught
the
name
margaret
and
dear
margaret
written
several
times
on
the
sheet
with
walpi
walpi
walpi
filling
the
lower
half
of
the
page
as
if
some
one
had
been
practising
it
and
because
these
two
words
were
just
now
keenly
in
his
mind
he
reached
for
the
second
paper
just
a
foot
or
two
away
and
found
more
sentences
and
words
a
third
paper
contained
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
letter
which
tanner
had
given
him
purporting
to
come
from
brownleigh
to
margaret
what
could
it
possibly
mean
in
great
astonishment
he
pulled
out
the
other
letter
and
compared
them
they
were
almost
identical
save
for
a
word
here
and
there
crossed
out
and
rewritten
he
stood
looking
mutely
at
the
papers
and
then
up
at
the
window
as
though
an
explanation
might
somehow
be
wafted
down
to
him
not
knowing
what
to
think
his
mind
filled
with
vague
alarm
just
at
that
moment
the
servant
appeared
rogers
says
would
you
mind
coming
down
to
the
corral
miss
rosa
has
a
headache
and
we
keeping
the
house
still
for
her
to
sleep
her
window
up
there
and
he
indicated
the
window
with
the
fluttering
curtain
dazed
and
half
suspicious
of
something
gardley
folded
the
two
letters
together
and
crushed
them
into
his
pocket
wondering
what
he
ought
to
do
about
it
the
thought
of
it
troubled
him
so
that
he
only
half
gave
attention
to
the
business
in
hand
but
he
gave
his
report
and
handed
over
certain
documents
he
was
thinking
that
perhaps
he
ought
to
see
miss
rosa
and
find
out
what
she
knew
of
margaret
going
and
ask
how
she
came
in
possession
of
this
other
letter
now
said
rogers
as
the
matter
was
concluded
i
owe
you
some
money
if
you
just
step
up
to
the
house
with
me
i
give
it
to
you
like
to
settle
matters
up
at
once
oh
let
it
go
till
i
come
again
said
gardley
impatient
to
be
off
he
wanted
to
get
by
himself
and
think
out
a
solution
of
the
two
letters
he
was
more
than
uneasy
about
margaret
without
being
able
to
give
any
suitable
explanation
of
why
he
should
be
his
main
desire
now
was
to
ride
to
ganado
and
find
out
if
the
missionaries
had
left
home
which
way
they
had
gone
and
whether
they
had
met
margaret
as
planned
no
step
right
up
to
the
house
with
me
insisted
rogers
it
take
long
and
i
have
the
money
in
my
safe
gardley
saw
that
the
quickest
way
was
to
please
rogers
and
he
did
not
wish
to
arouse
any
questions
because
he
supposed
of
course
his
alarm
was
mere
foolishness
so
they
went
together
into
rogers
private
office
where
his
desk
and
safe
were
the
principal
furniture
and
where
no
servants
ventured
to
come
without
orders
rogers
shoved
a
chair
for
gardley
and
went
over
to
his
safe
turning
the
little
nickel
knob
this
way
and
that
with
the
skill
of
one
long
accustomed
and
in
a
moment
the
thick
door
swung
open
and
rogers
drew
out
a
japanned
and
unlocked
it
but
when
he
threw
the
cover
back
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
angry
surprise
the
box
was
empty
chapter
xxxii
rogers
strode
to
the
door
forgetful
of
his
sleeping
daughter
overhead
and
thundered
out
his
call
for
james
the
servant
appeared
at
once
but
he
knew
nothing
about
the
safe
and
had
not
been
in
the
office
that
morning
other
servants
were
summoned
and
put
through
a
rigid
examination
then
rogers
turned
to
the
woman
who
had
answered
the
door
for
gardley
and
sent
her
up
to
call
rosa
but
the
woman
returned
presently
with
word
that
miss
rosa
was
not
in
her
room
and
there
was
no
sign
that
her
bed
had
been
slept
in
during
the
night
the
woman
face
was
sullen
she
did
not
like
rosa
but
was
afraid
of
her
this
to
her
was
only
another
of
miss
rosa
pranks
and
very
likely
her
doting
father
would
manage
to
blame
the
servants
with
the
affair
rogers
face
grew
stern
his
eyes
flashed
angrily
as
he
turned
and
strode
up
the
stairs
to
his
daughter
room
but
when
he
came
down
again
he
was
holding
a
note
in
his
trembling
hand
and
his
face
was
ashen
white
read
that
gardley
he
said
thrusting
the
note
into
gardley
hands
and
motioning
at
the
same
time
for
the
servants
to
go
away
gardley
took
the
note
yet
even
as
he
read
he
noticed
that
the
paper
was
the
same
as
those
he
carried
in
his
pocket
there
was
a
peculiar
watermark
that
made
it
noticeable
the
note
was
a
flippant
little
affair
from
rosa
telling
her
father
she
had
gone
away
to
be
married
and
that
she
would
let
him
know
where
she
was
as
soon
as
they
were
located
she
added
that
he
had
forced
her
to
this
step
by
being
so
severe
with
her
and
not
allowing
her
lover
to
come
to
see
her
if
he
had
been
reasonable
she
would
have
stayed
at
home
and
let
him
give
her
a
grand
wedding
but
as
it
was
she
had
only
this
way
of
seeking
her
happiness
she
added
that
she
knew
he
would
forgive
her
and
she
hoped
he
would
come
to
see
that
her
way
had
been
best
and
forsythe
was
all
that
he
could
desire
as
a
gardley
uttered
an
exclamation
of
dismay
as
he
read
and
looking
up
found
the
miserable
eyes
of
the
stricken
father
upon
him
for
the
moment
his
own
alarm
concerning
margaret
and
his
perplexity
about
the
letters
was
forgotten
in
the
grief
of
the
man
who
had
been
his
friend
when
did
she
go
asked
gardley
quickly
looking
up
she
took
supper
with
me
and
then
went
to
her
room
complaining
of
a
headache
said
the
father
his
voice
showing
his
utter
hopelessness
she
may
have
gone
early
in
the
evening
perhaps
for
we
all
turned
in
about
nine
to
keep
the
house
quiet
on
her
account
have
you
any
idea
which
way
they
went
east
or
west
gardley
was
the
keen
adviser
in
a
crisis
now
his
every
sense
on
the
alert
the
old
man
shook
his
head
it
is
too
late
now
he
said
still
in
that
colorless
voice
they
will
have
reached
the
railroad
somewhere
they
will
have
been
married
by
this
time
see
it
is
after
ten
yes
if
he
marries
her
said
gardley
fiercely
he
had
no
faith
in
forsythe
you
think
you
do
think
he
would
the
old
man
straightened
up
and
fairly
blazed
in
his
righteous
wrath
i
think
he
would
dare
anything
if
he
thought
he
would
not
be
caught
he
is
a
coward
of
course
what
can
we
do
telegraph
to
detectives
at
all
points
where
they
would
be
likely
to
arrive
and
have
them
shadowed
come
we
will
ride
to
the
station
at
once
but
first
could
i
go
up
in
her
room
and
look
around
there
might
be
some
clue
certainly
said
rogers
pointing
hopelessly
up
the
stairs
the
first
door
to
the
left
but
you
find
nothing
i
looked
everywhere
she
would
have
left
a
clue
while
you
up
there
i
interview
the
servants
then
we
go
as
he
went
gardley
was
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
tell
rogers
of
the
circumstance
of
the
two
letters
what
possible
connection
could
there
be
between
margaret
earle
trip
to
walpi
with
the
brownleighs
and
rosa
rogers
elopement
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
possible
explanation
was
there
for
a
copy
of
letter
to
blow
out
of
rosa
rogers
bedroom
window
how
could
it
have
got
there
rosa
room
was
in
beautiful
order
the
roses
nodding
in
at
the
window
the
curtain
blowing
back
and
forth
in
the
breeze
and
rippling
open
the
leaves
of
a
tiny
testament
lying
on
her
desk
as
if
it
had
been
recently
read
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
owner
of
the
room
had
taken
a
hasty
flight
on
the
desk
lay
several
sheets
of
with
the
peculiar
watermark
these
caught
his
attention
and
he
took
them
up
and
compared
them
with
the
papers
in
his
pocket
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
that
letter
which
had
sent
margaret
off
into
the
wilderness
with
an
unknown
indian
should
be
written
on
the
same
kind
of
paper
as
this
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
not
so
strange
after
all
it
probably
was
the
only
to
be
had
in
that
region
and
must
all
have
been
purchased
at
the
same
place
the
rippling
leaves
of
the
testament
fluttered
open
at
the
and
revealed
rosa
name
and
a
date
with
brownleigh
name
written
below
and
gardley
took
it
up
startled
again
to
find
hazel
brownleigh
mixed
up
with
the
rogers
he
had
not
known
that
they
had
anything
to
do
with
each
other
and
yet
of
course
they
would
being
the
missionaries
of
the
region
the
almost
empty
next
caught
his
eye
and
here
again
were
several
sheets
of
paper
written
over
with
words
and
phrases
words
which
at
once
he
recognized
as
part
of
the
letter
tanner
had
given
him
he
emptied
the
out
on
the
desk
thinking
perhaps
there
might
be
something
there
that
would
give
a
clue
to
where
the
elopers
had
gone
but
there
was
not
much
else
in
it
except
a
little
yellowed
note
with
the
signature
hazel
brownleigh
at
the
bottom
he
glanced
through
the
brief
note
gathered
its
purport
and
then
spread
it
out
deliberately
on
the
desk
and
compared
the
writing
with
the
others
a
wild
fear
clutching
at
his
heart
yet
he
could
not
in
any
way
explain
why
he
was
so
uneasy
what
possible
reason
could
rosa
rogers
have
for
forging
a
letter
to
margaret
from
hazel
brownleigh
suddenly
rogers
stood
behind
him
looking
over
his
shoulder
what
is
it
gardley
what
have
you
found
any
clue
no
clue
said
gardley
uneasily
but
something
strange
i
can
not
understand
i
do
suppose
it
can
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
your
daughter
and
yet
it
seems
almost
uncanny
this
morning
i
stopped
at
the
tanners
to
let
miss
earle
know
i
had
returned
and
was
told
she
had
gone
yesterday
with
a
couple
of
indians
as
guide
to
meet
the
brownleighs
at
keams
or
somewhere
near
there
and
take
a
trip
with
them
to
walpi
to
see
the
hopi
indians
tanner
gave
me
this
letter
from
brownleigh
which
miss
earle
had
left
behind
but
when
i
reached
here
and
was
waiting
for
you
some
papers
blew
out
of
your
window
when
i
picked
them
up
i
was
startled
to
find
that
one
of
them
was
an
exact
copy
of
the
letter
i
had
in
my
pocket
see
here
they
are
i
do
suppose
there
is
anything
to
it
but
in
spite
of
me
i
am
a
trifle
uneasy
about
miss
earle
i
just
ca
understand
how
that
copy
of
the
letter
came
to
be
here
rogers
was
leaning
over
looking
at
the
papers
what
this
he
asked
picking
up
the
note
that
came
with
the
testament
he
read
each
paper
carefully
took
in
the
little
testament
with
its
fluttering
and
inscription
studied
the
pages
of
words
and
alphabet
then
suddenly
turned
away
and
groaned
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
what
is
it
asked
gardley
awed
with
the
awful
sorrow
in
the
strong
man
attitude
my
poor
baby
groaned
the
father
my
poor
little
baby
girl
always
been
afraid
of
that
fatal
gift
of
hers
gardley
she
could
copy
any
handwriting
in
the
world
perfectly
she
could
write
my
name
so
it
could
not
be
told
from
my
own
signature
she
evidently
written
that
letter
why
i
do
know
unless
she
wanted
to
get
miss
earle
out
of
the
way
so
it
would
be
easier
for
her
to
carry
out
her
plans
it
ca
be
said
gardley
shaking
his
head
i
ca
see
what
her
object
would
be
besides
where
would
she
find
the
indians
tanner
saw
the
indians
they
came
to
the
school
after
her
with
the
letter
and
waited
for
her
tanner
saw
them
ride
off
together
there
were
a
couple
of
strange
indians
here
yesterday
begging
something
to
eat
said
rogers
settling
down
on
a
chair
and
resting
his
head
against
the
desk
as
if
he
had
suddenly
lost
the
strength
to
stand
this
wo
do
said
gardley
we
got
to
get
down
to
the
you
and
i
now
try
to
brace
up
are
the
horses
ready
then
we
go
right
away
you
better
question
the
servants
about
those
indians
first
said
rogers
and
gardley
as
he
hurried
down
the
stairs
heard
groan
after
groan
from
rosa
room
where
her
father
lingered
in
agony
gardley
got
all
the
information
he
could
about
the
indians
and
then
the
two
men
started
away
on
a
gallop
to
the
station
as
they
passed
the
tanner
house
gardley
drew
rein
to
call
to
bud
who
hurried
out
joyfully
to
greet
his
friend
his
face
lighting
with
pleasure
bill
get
on
your
horse
in
time
and
beat
it
out
to
camp
for
me
will
you
said
gardley
as
he
reached
down
and
gripped
rough
young
paw
tell
jasper
kemp
to
come
back
with
you
and
meet
me
at
the
station
as
quick
as
he
can
tell
him
to
have
the
men
where
he
can
signal
them
we
may
have
to
hustle
out
on
a
long
hunt
and
bill
keep
your
head
steady
and
get
back
yourself
right
away
perhaps
i
want
you
to
help
me
i
a
little
anxious
about
miss
earle
but
you
need
tell
anybody
that
but
old
jasper
tell
him
to
hurry
for
all
he
worth
bud
with
his
eyes
large
with
loyalty
and
trouble
nodded
understandingly
returned
the
grip
of
the
young
man
hand
with
a
clumsy
squeeze
and
sprang
away
to
get
his
horse
and
do
gardley
bidding
gardley
knew
he
would
ride
as
for
his
life
now
that
he
knew
safety
was
at
stake
then
gardley
rode
on
to
the
station
and
was
indefatigable
for
two
hours
hunting
out
addresses
writing
telegrams
and
calling
up
telephones
when
all
had
been
done
that
was
possible
rogers
turned
a
haggard
face
to
the
young
man
i
been
thinking
gardley
that
rash
little
girl
of
mine
may
have
got
miss
earle

some
kind
of
a
dangerous
position
you
ought
to
look
after
her
what

gardley
just
as
soon
as
i
done
everything
i

for
jasper
kemp
and
we
make
a
plan
between

and

miss
earle

men

rest
easy
till
i
know
miss
earle
is
safe
he
sank
down
on
a
truck
that
stood
on
the
station
platform
his
shoulders
slumping
his
whole
attitude
as
of
one
who
was
fatally
stricken
it
came
over
gardley
how
suddenly
old
he
looked
and
haggard
and
gray
what
a
thing
for
the
selfish
child
to
have
done
to
her
father
poor
silly
child
whose
fate
with
forsythe
would
in
all
probability
be
anything
but
enviable
but
there
was
no
time
for
sorrowful
reflections
jasper
kemp
stern
alert
anxious
came
riding
furiously
down
the
street
bud
keeping
even
pace
with
him
chapter
xxxiii
while
gardley
briefly
told
his
tale
to
jasper
kemp
and
the
scotchman
was
hastily
scanning
the
papers
with
his
keen
bright
eyes
bud
stood
frowning
and
listening
intently
gee
he
burst
forth
that
girl
a
mess
she
did
it
you
oughta
seen
what
all
she
did
do
the
last
six
weeks
of
school
miss
got
so
she
shivered
every
time
that
girl
came
near
her
or
looked
at
her
she
sure
had
her
goat
some
nights
after
school
when
she
thought
she
all
alone
she
just
cried
she
did
why
rosa
had
every
one
of
those
guys
in
the
back
seat
acting
like
the
devil
and
nobody
knew
what
was
the
matter
she
wrote
things
on
the
blackboard
right
in
the
questions
so
it
looked
like
miss
writing
fierce
things
sometimes
and
miss
did
know
who
did
it
and
she
was
as
jealous
as
a
cat
of
miss
you
all
know
what
a
case
she
had
on
that
guy
from
over
by
the
fort
and
she
did
like
to
have
him
even
look
at
miss
well
she
did
forget
how
he
went
away
that
night
of
the
play
i
caught
her
looking
at
her
like
she
would
like
to
murder
her
night
some
look
the
guy
had
a
case
on
miss
all
right
too
only
she
was
onto
him
and
would
look
at
him
nor
let
him
spoon
nor
nothing
but
rosa
saw
it
all
and
she
just
hated
miss
then
once
miss
stopped
her
from
going
out
to
meet
that
guy
too
oh
she
hated
her
all
right
and
you
can
bet
she
wrote
the
letter
sure
she
did
she
wanted
to
get
her
away
when
that
guy
came
back
he
was
back
yesterday
i
saw
him
over
by
the
run
on
that
trail
that
crosses
the
trail
to
the
old
cabin
he
did
see
me
i
got
my
eye
on
him
first
and
i
chucked
behind
some
but
he
was
here
all
right
and
he
did
mean
any
good
i
follahed
him
awhile
till
he
stopped
and
fixed
up
a
place
to
camp
i
guess
he
must
stayed
out
last
night
a
heavy
hand
was
suddenly
laid
from
behind
on
bud
shoulder
and
rogers
stood
over
him
his
dark
eyes
on
fire
his
lips
trembling
boy
can
you
show
me
where
that
was
he
asked
and
there
was
an
intensity
in
his
voice
that
showed
bud
that
something
serious
was
the
matter
boylike
he
dropped
his
eyes
indifferently
before
this
great
emotion
sure
best
take
long
bill
with
you
rogers
advised
jasper
kemp
keenly
alive
to
the
whole
situation
i
reckon
we
all
have
to
work
together
my
men
ai
far
off
and
he
lifted
his
whistle
to
his
lips
and
blew
the
signal
blasts
the
kid
here
want
to
ride
to
keams
to
see
if
the
lady
is
all
safe
and

go
straight
to
ganado
and
find

started
and
put
wise
to

my
suspicions

friendlies
i
did
like
that
injun
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
him
hanging
round
the
but
i
would
have
stirred
a
step
toward
camp
if
i
suspected
he
was
come
fur
the
lady
you
take
bud
and
long
bill
and
go
find
that
and
see
if

any
trail

which
way
they
took
if

three
shots
and
the
men
be
with
you
if
you
want

kid

shots

so
fur
away
by
that
time
that
he
ca
hear
he
got
to
get
provisioned
he
starts
lead
him
out
bud
we
got
no
time
to
lose
bud
gave
one
despairing
look
at
gardley
and
turned
to
obey
that
all
right
bud
said
gardley
with
an
understanding
glance
you
tell
rogers
all
you
know
and
show
him
the
place
and
then
when
long
bill
comes
you
can
take
the
to
the
long
trail
and
go
with
me
i
just
stop
at
the
house
as
i
go
by
and
tell
your
mother
i
need
you
bud
gave
one
radiant
grateful
look
and
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
rogers
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
him
at
first
till
bud
got
interested
in
giving
him
a
detailed
account
of
forsythe
looks
and
acts
in
less
than
an
hour
the
relief
expedition
had
started
before
night
had
fallen
jasper
kemp
riding
hard
arrived
at
the
mission
told
his
story
procured
a
fresh
horse
and
after
a
couple
of
hours
rest
started
with
brownleigh
and
his
wife
for
keams
cañon
gardley
and
bud
riding
for
all
they
were
worth
said
little
by
the
way
now
and
then
the
boy
stole
glances
at
the
man
face
and
the
dead
weight
of
sorrow
settled
like
lead
the
heavier
upon
his
heart
too
well
he
knew
the
dangers
of
the
desert
he
could
almost
read
fears
in
the
white
drawn
look
about
his
lips
the
ashen
circles
under
his
eyes
the
tense
strained
pose
of
his
whole
figure
gardley
mind
was
urging
ahead
of
his
steed
and
his
body
could
not
relax
he
was
anxious
to
go
a
little
faster
yet
his
judgment
knew
it
would
not
do
for
his
horse
would
play
out
before
he
could
get
another
they
ate
their
corn
bread
in
the
saddle
and
only
turned
aside
from
the
trail
once
to
drink
at
a
and
fill
their
cans
they
rode
late
into
the
night
with
only
the
stars
and
their
wits
to
guide
them
when
they
stopped
to
rest
they
did
not
wait
to
make
a
fire
but
hobbled
the
horses
where
they
might
feed
and
rolling
quickly
in
their
blankets
lay
down
upon
the
ground
bud
with
the
fatigue
of
healthy
youth
would
have
slept
till
morning
in
spite
of
his
fears
but
gardley
woke
him
in
a
couple
of
hours
made
him
drink
some
water
and
eat
a
bite
of
food
and
they
went
on
their
way
again
when
morning
broke
they
were
almost
to
the
entrance
of
keams
cañon
and
both
looked
haggard
and
worn
bud
seemed
to
have
aged
in
the
night
and
gardley
looked
at
him
almost
tenderly
are
you
all
in
kid
he
asked
naw
answered
bud
promptly
with
an
assumed
cheerfulness
feeling
like
a
get
on
to
that
sky
guess
we
going
to
have
some
day
pretty
as
a
red
wagon
gardley
smiled
sadly
what
would
that
day
bring
forth
for
the
two
who
went
in
search
of
her
they
loved
his
great
anxiety
was
to
get
to
keams
cañon
and
inquire
they
would
surely
know
at
the
whether
the
missionary
and
his
party
had
gone
that
way
the
road
was
still
almost
impassable
from
the
flood
the
two
dauntless
riders
picked
their
way
slowly
down
the
trail
to
the
post
but
the
trader
could
tell
them
nothing
comforting
the
missionary
had
not
been
that
way
in
two
months
and
there
had
been
no
party
and
no
lady
there
that
week
a
single
strange
indian
had
come
down
the
trail
above
the
day
before
stayed
awhile
picked
a
quarrel
with
some
men
who
were
there
and
then
ridden
back
up
the
steep
trail
again
he
might
have
had
a
party
with
him
up
on
the
mesa
waiting
he
had
said
something
about
his
squaw
the
trader
admitted
that
he
might
have
been
drunk
but
he
frowned
as
he
spoke
of
him
he
called
him
a
bad
indian
something
unpleasant
had
evidently
happened
the
trader
gave
them
a
good
hot
dinner
of
which
they
stood
sorely
in
need
and
because
they
realized
that
they
must
keep
up
their
strength
they
took
the
time
to
eat
it
then
procuring
fresh
horses
they
climbed
the
steep
trail
in
the
direction
the
trader
said
the
indian
had
taken
it
was
a
slender
clue
but
it
was
all
they
had
and
they
must
follow
it
and
now
the
travelers
were
very
silent
as
if
they
felt
they
were
drawing
near
to
some
knowledge
that
would
settle
the
question
for
them
one
way
or
the
other
as
they
reached
the
top
at
last
where
they
could
see
out
across
the
plain
each
drew
a
long
breath
like
a
gasp
and
looked
about
half
fearing
what
he
might
see
yes
there
was
the
sign
of
a
recent
and
a
few
tin
cans
and
bits
of
refuse
nothing
more
gardley
got
down
and
searched
carefully
bud
even
crept
about
upon
his
hands
and
knees
but
a
single
tiny
blue
bead
like
a
grain
of
sand
was
all
that
rewarded
his
efforts
some
indian
had
doubtless
camped
here
that
was
all
the
evidence
standing
thus
in
hopeless
uncertainty
what
to
do
next
they
suddenly
heard
voices
something
familiar
once
or
twice
made
gardley
lift
his
whistle
and
blow
a
blast
instantly
a
silvery
answer
came
ringing
from
the
mesa
a
mile
or
so
away
and
woke
the
echoes
in
the
cañon
jasper
kemp
and
his
party
had
taken
the
longer
way
around
instead
of
going
down
the
cañon
and
were
just
arriving
at
the
spot
where
margaret
and
the
squaw
had
waited
two
days
before
for
their
drunken
guide
but
jasper
kemp
whistle
rang
out
again
and
he
shot
three
times
into
the
air
their
signal
to
wait
for
some
important
news
breathlessly
and
in
silence
the
two
waited
till
the
coming
of
the
rest
of
the
party
and
cast
themselves
down
on
the
ground
feeling
the
sudden
need
of
support
now
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
some
news
they
felt
hardly
able
to
bear
it
and
the
waiting
for
it
was
intolerable
to
such
a
point
of
anxious
tension
were
they
strained
but
when
the
party
from
ganado
came
in
sight
their
faces
wore
no
brightness
of
good
news
their
greetings
were
quiet
sad
anxious
and
jasper
kemp
held
out
to
gardley
an
envelope
it
was
the
one
from
margaret
mother
letter
that
she
had
dropped
upon
the
trail
we
found
it
on
the
way
from
ganado
just
as
we
entered
steamboat
cañon
explained
jasper
and
did
you
search
for
a
trail
off
in
any
other
direction
asked
gardley
almost
sharply
they
have
not
been
here
at
least
only
one
indian
has
been
down
to
the
trader
there
was
no
other
trail
we
looked
said
jasper
sadly
there
was
a
twice
and
signs
of
a
camp
we
felt
sure
they
had
come
this
way
gardley
shook
his
head
and
a
look
of
abject
despair
came
over
his
face
there
is
no
sign
here
he
said
they
must
have
gone
some
other
way
perhaps
the
indian
has
carried
her
off
are
the
other
men
following
no
rogers
sent
them
in
the
other
direction
after
his
girl
they
found
the
camp
all
right
bud
tell
you
we
made
sure
we
had
found
our
trail
and
would
not
need
them
gardley
dropped
his
head
and
almost
groaned
meanwhile
the
missionary
had
been
riding
around
in
radiating
circles
from
the
dead
searching
every
step
of
the
way
and
bud
taking
his
cue
from
him
looked
off
toward
the
mesa
a
minute
then
struck
out
in
a
straight
line
for
it
and
rode
off
like
mad
suddenly
there
was
heard
a
shout
loud
and
long
and
bud
came
riding
back
waving
something
small
and
white
above
his
head
they
gathered
in
a
little
knot
waiting
for
the
boy
not
speaking
and
when
he
halted
in
their
midst
he
fluttered
down
the
handkerchief
to
gardley
it
hers
all
right
gotter
name
all
written
out
on
the
edge
he
declared
radiantly
the
sky
grew
brighter
to
them
all
now
eagerly
gardley
sprang
into
his
saddle
no
longer
weary
but
alert
and
eager
for
the
trail
you
folks
better
go
down
to
the
trader
and
get
some
dinner
need
it
bud
and
i
go
on
brownleigh
looks
all
in
no
declared
hazel
decidedly
we
just
snatch
a
bite
here
and
follow
you
at
once
i
could
enjoy
a
dinner
till
i
know
she
is
safe
and
so
though
both
jasper
kemp
and
her
husband
urged
her
otherwise
she
would
take
a
hasty
meal
by
the
way
and
hurry
on
but
bud
and
gardley
waited
not
for
others
they
plunged
wildly
ahead
it
seemed
a
long
way
to
the
eager
hunters
from
the
place
where
bud
had
found
the
handkerchief
to
the
little
note
twisted
around
the
red
chessman
it
was
perhaps
nearly
a
mile
and
both
the
riders
had
searched
in
all
directions
for
some
time
before
gardley
spied
it
eagerly
he
seized
upon
the
note
recognizing
the
little
red
manikin
with
which
he
had
whiled
away
an
hour
with
margaret
during
one
of
her
visits
at
the
camp
the
note
was
written
large
and
clear
upon
a
sheet
of
i
am
margaret
earle
at
ashland
i
am
supposed
to
be
traveling
to
walpi
by
way
of
keams
to
meet
and
brownleigh
of
ganado
i
am
with
an
indian
his
squaw
and
papoose
the
indian
said
he
was
sent
to
guide
me
but
he
is
drunk
now
and
i
am
frightened
he
has
acted
strangely
all
the
way
i
do
not
know
where
i
am
please
come
and
help
me
bud
sitting
anxious
like
a
statue
upon
his
horse
read
gardley
face
as
gardley
read
the
note
then
gardley
read
it
aloud
to
bud
and
before
the
last
word
was
fairly
out
of
his
mouth
both
man
and
boy
started
as
if
they
had
heard
margaret
beloved
voice
calling
them
it
was
not
long
before
bud
found
another
scrap
of
paper
a
farther
on
and
then
another
and
another
scattered
at
great
distances
along
the
way
the
only
way
they
had
of
being
sure
she
had
dropped
them
was
that
they
seemed
to
be
the
same
kind
of
paper
as
that
upon
which
the
note
was
written
how
that
note
with
its
brave
frightened
appeal
wrung
the
heart
of
gardley
as
he
thought
of
margaret
unprotected
in
terror
and
perhaps
in
peril
riding
on
she
knew
not
where
what
trials
and
fears
had
she
not
already
passed
through
what
might
she
not
be
experiencing
even
now
while
he
searched
for
her
it
was
perhaps
two
hours
before
he
found
the
little
white
stocking
dropped
where
the
trail
divided
showing
which
way
she
had
taken
gardley
folded
it
reverently
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
an
hour
later
bud
pounced
upon
the
bedroom
slipper
and
carried
it
gleefully
to
gardley
and
so
by
slow
degrees
finding
here
and
there
a
chessman
or
more
paper
they
came
at
last
to
the
camp
where
the
indians
had
abandoned
their
trust
and
fled
leaving
margaret
alone
in
the
wilderness
it
was
then
that
gardley
searched
in
vain
for
any
further
clue
and
riding
wide
in
every
direction
stopped
and
called
her
name
again
and
again
while
the
sun
grew
lower
and
lower
and
shadows
crept
in
waiting
for
the
night
it
was
then
that
bud
flying
frantically
from
one
spot
to
another
got
down
upon
his
knees
behind
a
when
gardley
was
not
looking
and
mumbled
a
rough
hasty
prayer
for
help
he
felt
like
the
old
woman
who
on
being
told
that
nothing
but
god
could
save
the
ship
exclaimed
and
has
it
come
to
that
bud
had
felt
all
his
life
that
there
was
a
remote
time
in
every
life
when
one
might
need
to
believe
in
prayer
the
time
had
come
for
bud
margaret
on
her
knees
in
the
sand
of
the
desert
praying
for
help
remembered
the
promise
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
and
knew
not
that
her
deliverers
were
on
the
way
the
sun
had
been
hot
as
it
beat
down
upon
the
whiteness
of
the
sand
and
the
girl
had
crept
under
a
for
shelter
from
it
the
pain
in
her
ankle
was
sickening
she
had
removed
her
shoe
and
bound
the
ankle
about
with
a
handkerchief
soaked
with
half
of
her
bottle
of
and
so
lying
quiet
had
fallen
asleep
too
exhausted
with
pain
and
anxiety
to
stay
awake
any
longer
when
she
awoke
again
the
softness
of
evening
was
hovering
over
everything
and
she
started
up
and
listened
surely
surely
she
had
heard
a
voice
calling
her
she
sat
up
sharply
and
listened
ah
there
it
was
again
a
faint
echo
in
the
distance
was
it
a
voice
or
was
it
only
her
dreams
mingling
with
her
fancies
travelers
in
deserts
she
had
read
took
all
sorts
of
fancies
saw
mirages
heard
sounds
that
were
not
but
she
had
not
been
out
long
enough
to
have
caught
such
a
desert
fever
perhaps
she
was
going
to
be
sick
still
that
faint
echo
made
her
heart
beat
wildly
she
dragged
herself
to
her
knees
then
to
her
feet
standing
painfully
with
the
weight
on
her
well
foot
the
suffering
horse
turned
his
anguished
eyes
and
whinnied
her
heart
ached
for
him
yet
there
was
no
way
she
could
assuage
his
pain
or
put
him
out
of
his
misery
but
she
must
make
sure
if
she
had
heard
a
voice
could
she
possibly
scale
that
rock
down
which
she
and
her
horse
had
fallen
for
then
she
might
look
out
farther
and
see
if
there
were
any
one
in
sight
painfully
she
crawled
and
crept
up
and
up
inch
by
inch
until
at
last
she
gained
the
little
height
and
could
look
afar
there
was
no
living
thing
in
sight
the
air
was
very
clear
the
eagle
had
found
his
evening
rest
somewhere
in
a
quiet
crag
the
long
corn
waved
on
the
distant
plain
and
all
was
deathly
still
once
more
there
was
a
hint
of
coming
sunset
in
the
sky
her
heart
sank
and
she
was
about
to
give
up
hope
entirely
when
rich
and
clear
there
it
came
again
a
voice
in
the
wilderness
calling
her
name
margaret
margaret
the
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
and
crowded
in
her
throat
she
could
not
answer
she
was
so
overwhelmed
and
though
she
tried
twice
to
call
out
she
could
make
no
sound
but
the
call
kept
coming
again
and
again
margaret
margaret
and
it
was
gardley
voice
impossible
for
gardley
was
far
away
and
could
not
know
her
need
yet
it
was
his
voice
had
she
died
or
was
she
in
delirium
that
she
seemed
to
hear
him
calling
her
name
but
the
call
came
clearer
now
margaret
margaret
i
am
coming
and
like
a
flash
her
mind
went
back
to
the
first
night
in
arizona
when
she
heard
him
singing
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
now
she
struggled
to
her
feet
again
and
shouted
inarticulately
and
gladly
through
her
tears
she
could
see
him
it
was
gardley
he
was
riding
fast
toward
her
and
he
shot
three
shots
into
the
air
above
him
as
he
rode
and
three
shrill
blasts
of
his
whistle
rang
out
on
the
still
evening
air
she
tore
the
scarf
from
her
neck
that
she
had
tied
about
it
to
keep
the
sun
from
blistering
her
and
waved
it
wildly
in
the
air
now
shouting
in
happy
choking
sobs
and
so
he
came
to
her
across
the
desert
he
sprang
down
before
the
horse
had
fairly
reached
her
side
and
rushing
to
her
took
her
in
his
arms
margaret
my
darling
i
have
found
you
at
last
she
swayed
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
his
arms
and
then
he
saw
her
white
face
and
knew
she
must
be
suffering
you
are
hurt
he
cried
oh
what
have
they
done
to
you
and
he
laid
her
gently
down
upon
the
sand
and
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
her
oh
no
she
gasped
joyously
with
white
lips
i
all
right
now
only
my
ankle
hurts
a
little
we
had
a
fall
the
horse
and
oh
go
to
him
at
once
and
put
him
out
of
his
pain
i
sure
his
legs
are
broken
for
answer
gardley
put
the
whistle
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
blast
he
would
not
leave
her
for
an
instant
he
was
not
sure
yet
that
she
was
not
more
hurt
than
she
had
said
he
set
about
discovering
at
once
for
he
had
brought
with
him
supplies
for
all
emergencies
it
was
bud
who
came
riding
madly
across
the
mesa
in
answer
to
the
call
reaching
gardley
before
any
one
else
bud
with
his
eyes
shining
his
cheeks
blazing
with
excitement
his
hair
wildly
flying
in
the
breeze
his
young
boyish
face
suddenly
grown
old
with
lines
of
anxiety
but
you
would
have
known
from
his
greeting
that
it
was
anything
more
than
a
pleasure
excursion
he
had
been
on
the
past
two
days
good
work
kid
whatcha
want
me
t
do
it
was
bud
who
arranged
the
camp
and
went
back
to
tell
the
other
detachments
that
margaret
was
found
bud
who
led
the
up
unpacked
the
provisions
and
gathered
wood
to
start
a
fire
bud
was
everywhere
with
a
smudged
face
a
weary
gray
look
around
his
eyes
and
his
hair
sticking
seven
ways
for
sunday
yet
once
when
his
labors
led
him
near
to
where
margaret
lay
weak
and
happy
on
a
couch
of
blankets
he
gave
her
an
unwonted
pat
on
her
shoulder
and
said
in
a
low
tone
hello
gang
see
you
kept
your
nerve
with
you
and
then
he
gave
her
a
grin
all
across
his
dirty
tired
face
and
moved
away
as
if
he
were
half
ashamed
of
his
emotion
but
it
was
bud
again
who
came
and
talked
with
her
to
divert
her
so
that
she
would
notice
when
they
shot
her
horse
he
talked
loudly
about
a
coyote
they
shot
the
night
before
and
a
cottontail
they
saw
at
keams
and
when
he
saw
that
she
understood
what
the
shot
meant
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
he
gave
her
hand
a
rough
bear
squeeze
and
said
gruffly
you
should
worry
he
better
off
now
and
when
gardley
came
back
he
took
himself
thoughtfully
to
a
distance
and
busied
himself
opening
tins
of
meat
and
soup
in
another
hour
the
brownleighs
arrived
having
heard
the
signals
and
they
had
a
supper
around
the
everybody
so
rejoiced
that
there
were
still
quivers
in
their
voices
and
when
any
one
laughed
it
sounded
like
the
echo
of
a
sob
so
great
had
been
the
strain
of
their
anxiety
gardley
sitting
beside
margaret
in
the
starlight
afterward
her
hand
in
his
listened
to
the
story
of
her
journey
the
strong
tender
pressure
of
his
fingers
telling
her
how
deeply
it
affected
him
to
know
the
peril
through
which
she
had
passed
later
when
the
others
were
telling
gay
stories
about
the
fire
and
bud
lying
full
length
in
their
midst
had
fallen
fast
asleep
these
two
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
were
murmuring
their
innermost
thoughts
in
low
tones
to
each
other
and
rejoicing
that
they
were
together
once
more
chapter
xxxiv
they
talked
it
over
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
as
they
sat
around
the
fire
jasper
kemp
thought
he
ought
to
get
right
back
to
attend
to
things
rogers
was
all
broken
up
and
might
even
need
him
to
search
for
rosa
if
they
had
not
found
out
her
whereabouts
yet
he
and
fiddling
boss
who
had
come
along
would
start
back
at
once
they
had
had
a
good
night
rest
and
had
found
their
dear
lady
what
more
did
they
need
besides
there
were
not
provisions
for
an
indefinite
stay
for
such
a
large
party
and
there
were
none
too
many
sources
of
supply
in
this
region
the
missionary
thought
that
now
he
was
here
he
ought
to
go
on
to
walpi
it
was
not
more
than
two
hours
ride
there
and
hazel
could
stay
with
the
camp
while
margaret
ankle
had
a
chance
to
rest
and
let
the
swelling
subside
under
treatment
margaret
however
rebelled
she
did
not
wish
to
be
an
invalid
and
was
very
sure
she
could
ride
without
injury
to
her
ankle
she
wanted
to
see
walpi
and
the
queer
hopi
indians
now
she
was
so
near
so
a
compromise
was
agreed
upon
they
would
all
wait
in
camp
a
couple
of
days
and
then
if
margaret
felt
well
enough
they
would
go
on
visit
the
hopis
and
so
go
home
together
bud
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
stay
with
them
and
jasper
kemp
promised
to
make
it
all
right
with
his
parents
so
for
two
whole
long
lovely
days
the
little
party
of
five
camped
on
the
mesa
and
enjoyed
sweet
converse
it
is
safe
to
say
that
never
in
all
bud
life
will
he
forget
or
get
away
from
the
influences
of
that
day
in
such
company
gardley
and
the
missionary
proved
to
be
the
best
of
physicians
and
margaret
ankle
improved
hourly
under
their
united
treatment
of
compresses
lotions
and
rest
about
noon
on
saturday
they
broke
camp
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
away
across
the
stretch
of
white
sand
through
tall
cornfields
growing
right
up
out
of
the
sand
closer
and
closer
to
the
great
mesa
with
the
pueblos
five
hundred
feet
above
them
on
the
top
it
seemed
to
margaret
like
suddenly
being
dropped
into
egypt
or
the
holy
land
or
some
of
the
babylonian
excavations
so
curious
and
primitive
and
altogether
different
from
anything
else
she
had
ever
seen
did
it
all
appear
she
listened
fascinated
while
brownleigh
told
about
this
strange
hopi
land
the
strangest
spot
in
america
spanish
explorers
found
them
away
back
years
before
the
pilgrims
landed
and
called
the
country
tuscayan
they
built
their
homes
up
high
for
protection
from
their
enemies
they
lived
on
the
corn
pumpkins
peaches
and
melons
which
they
raised
in
the
valley
planting
the
seeds
with
their
hands
it
is
supposed
they
got
their
seeds
first
from
the
spaniards
years
ago
they
make
pottery
cloth
and
baskets
and
are
a
busy
people
there
are
seven
villages
built
on
three
mesas
in
the
northern
desert
one
of
the
largest
orabi
has
a
thousand
inhabitants
walpi
numbers
about
two
hundred
and
thirty
people
all
living
in
this
one
great
building
of
many
rooms
they
are
divided
into
brotherhoods
or
phratries
and
each
brotherhood
has
several
large
families
they
are
ruled
by
a
speaker
chief
and
a
war
chief
elected
by
a
council
of
clan
elders
margaret
learned
with
wonder
that
all
the
water
these
people
used
had
to
be
carried
by
the
women
in
jars
on
their
backs
five
hundred
feet
up
the
steep
trail
presently
as
they
drew
nearer
a
curious
man
with
his
hair
banged
like
a
child
and
garments
much
like
those
usually
worn
by
scarecrows
a
shapeless
kind
of
shirt
and
trousers
appeared
along
the
steep
and
showed
them
the
way
up
margaret
and
the
missionary
wife
exclaimed
in
horror
over
the
little
children
playing
along
the
very
edge
of
the
cliffs
above
as
carelessly
as
birds
in
trees
high
up
on
the
mesa
at
last
how
strange
and
weird
it
seemed
far
below
the
yellow
sand
of
the
valley
fifteen
miles
away
a
second
mesa
stretching
dark
to
the
southwest
a
hundred
miles
distant
the
dim
outlines
of
the
san
francisco
peaks
some
little
children
on
burros
crossing
the
sand
below
looked
as
if
they
were
part
of
a
curious
not
as
if
they
were
little
living
beings
taking
life
as
seriously
as
other
children
do
the
great
wide
desert
stretching
far
the
bare
solid
rocks
beneath
their
feet
the
curious
houses
behind
them
it
all
seemed
unreal
to
margaret
like
a
great
spread
out
for
her
to
see
she
turned
from
gazing
and
found
eyes
upon
her
adoringly
a
tender
understanding
of
her
mood
in
his
glance
she
thrilled
with
pleasure
to
be
here
with
him
a
soft
flush
spread
over
her
cheeks
and
a
light
came
into
her
eyes
they
found
the
indians
preparing
for
one
of
their
most
famous
ceremonies
the
snake
dance
which
was
to
take
place
in
a
few
days
for
almost
a
week
the
snake
priests
had
been
busy
hunting
rattlesnakes
building
altars
drawing
figures
in
the
sand
and
singing
weird
songs
on
the
ninth
day
the
snakes
are
washed
in
a
pool
and
driven
near
a
pile
of
sand
the
priests
arrayed
in
paint
feathers
and
charms
come
out
in
line
and
taking
the
live
snakes
in
their
mouths
parade
up
and
down
the
rocks
while
the
people
crowd
the
roofs
and
terraces
of
the
pueblos
to
watch
there
are
helpers
to
whip
the
snakes
and
keep
them
from
biting
and
catchers
to
see
that
none
get
away
in
a
little
while
the
priests
take
the
snakes
down
on
the
desert
and
set
them
free
sending
them
north
south
east
and
west
where
it
is
supposed
they
will
take
the
people
prayers
for
rain
to
the
water
serpent
in
the
underworld
who
is
in
some
way
connected
with
the
god
of
the
it
was
a
strange
experience
that
night
in
walpi
the
primitive
accommodations
the
picturesque
uncivilized
people
the
shy
glances
from
dark
eager
eyes
to
watch
two
girls
grinding
corn
between
two
stones
and
a
little
farther
off
their
mother
rolling
out
her
dough
with
an
ear
of
corn
and
cooking
over
an
open
fire
her
pot
slung
from
a
crude
crane
over
the
blaze
it
was
all
too
unreal
to
be
true
but
the
most
interesting
thing
about
it
was
to
watch
the
aneshodi
going
about
among
them
his
face
alight
with
warm
human
love
his
hearty
laugh
ringing
out
in
a
joke
that
the
hopis
seemed
to
understand
making
himself
one
with
them
it
came
to
margaret
suddenly
to
remember
the
pompous
little
figure
of
the
rev
frederick
west
and
to
fancy
him
going
about
among
these
people
and
trying
to
do
them
good
before
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
then
of
course
she
had
to
explain
to
bud
and
gardley
who
looked
at
her
inquiringly
aw
gee
was
a
minister
he
was
a
fergit
him
the
poor
simp
growled
bud
sympathetically
then
his
eyes
softened
as
he
watched
brownleigh
playing
with
three
little
indian
maids
having
a
fine
romp
gee
he
certainly
is
a
peach
is
he
he
murmured
his
whole
face
kindling
appreciatively
gee
i
bet
that
kid
never
forgets
that
the
sunday
was
a
wonderful
day
when
the
missionary
gathered
the
people
together
and
spoke
to
them
in
simple
words
of
god
their
god
who
made
the
sky
the
stars
the
mountains
and
the
sun
whom
they
call
by
different
names
but
whom
he
called
god
he
spoke
of
the
book
of
heaven
that
told
about
god
and
his
great
love
for
men
so
great
that
he
sent
his
son
to
save
them
from
their
sin
it
was
not
a
long
sermon
but
a
very
beautiful
one
and
listening
to
the
simple
wonderful
words
of
life
that
fell
from
the
missionary
earnest
lips
and
were
translated
by
his
faithful
indian
interpreter
who
always
went
with
him
on
his
expeditions
watching
the
faces
of
the
dark
strange
people
as
they
took
in
the
marvelous
meaning
the
little
company
of
visitors
was
strangely
moved
even
bud
awed
beyond
his
wont
said
shyly
to
margaret
gee
it
something
fierce
not
to
be
born
a
christian
and
know
all
that
ai
it
margaret
and
gardley
walked
a
little
way
down
the
narrow
path
that
led
out
over
the
neck
of
rock
less
than
a
rod
wide
that
connects
the
great
promontory
with
the
mesa
the
sun
was
setting
in
majesty
over
the
desert
and
the
scene
was
one
of
breathless
beauty
one
might
fancy
it
might
look
so
to
stand
on
the
hills
of
god
and
look
out
over
creation
when
all
things
have
been
made
new
they
stood
for
a
while
in
silence
then
margaret
looked
down
at
the
narrow
path
worn
more
than
a
foot
deep
in
the
solid
rock
by
the
ten
generations
of
feet
that
had
been
passing
over
it
just
think
she
said
of
all
the
feet
little
and
big
that
have
walked
here
in
all
the
years
and
of
all
the
souls
that
have
stood
and
looked
out
over
this
wonderful
sight
it
must
be
that
somehow
in
spite
of
their
darkness
they
have
reached
out
to
the
god
who
made
this
and
have
found
a
way
to
his
heart
they
could
look
at
this
and
not
feel
him
could
they
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
some
of
those
poor
creatures
who
have
stood
here
and
reached
up
blindly
after
the
creator
of
their
souls
have
perhaps
been
as
pleasing
to
him
as
those
who
have
known
about
him
from
childhood
gardley
was
used
to
her
talking
this
way
he
had
not
been
in
her
sunday
meetings
for
nothing
he
understood
and
sympathized
and
now
his
hand
reached
softly
for
hers
and
held
it
tenderly
after
a
moment
of
silence
he
said
i
surely
think
if
god
could
reach
and
find
me
in
the
desert
of
my
life
he
must
have
found
them
i
sometimes
think
i
was
a
greater
heathen
than
all
these
because
i
knew
and
would
not
see
margaret
nestled
her
hand
in
his
and
looked
up
joyfully
into
his
face
i
so
glad
you
know
him
now
she
murmured
happily
they
stood
for
some
time
looking
out
over
the
changing
scene
till
the
crimson
faded
into
rose
the
silver
into
gray
till
the
stars
bloomed
out
one
by
one
and
down
in
the
valley
across
the
desert
a
light
twinkled
faintly
here
and
there
from
the
camps
of
the
hopi
shepherds
they
started
home
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
the
whole
company
of
indians
standing
on
the
rocks
to
send
them
royally
on
their
way
pressing
simple
homely
gifts
upon
them
and
begging
them
to
return
soon
again
and
tell
the
blessed
story
a
wonderful
ride
they
had
back
to
ganado
where
gardley
left
margaret
for
a
short
visit
promising
to
return
for
her
in
a
few
days
when
she
was
rested
and
hastened
back
to
ashland
to
his
work
for
his
soul
was
happy
now
and
at
ease
and
he
felt
he
must
get
to
work
at
once
rogers
would
need
him
poor
rogers
had
he
found
his
daughter
yet
poor
silly
but
when
gardley
reached
ashland
he
found
among
his
mail
awaiting
him
a
telegram
his
uncle
was
dead
and
the
fortune
which
he
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
was
his
and
which
he
had
idly
tossed
away
in
a
moment
of
recklessness
had
been
restored
to
him
by
the
uncle
last
will
made
since
gardley
recent
visit
home
the
fortune
was
his
again
gardley
sat
in
his
office
on
the
rogers
ranch
and
stared
hard
at
the
adobe
wall
opposite
his
desk
that
fortune
would
be
great
he
could
do
such
wonderful
things
for
margaret
now
they
could
work
out
their
dreams
together
for
the
people
they
loved
he
could
see
the
shadows
of
those
dreams
a
beautiful
home
for
margaret
out
on
the
trail
she
loved
where
wildness
and
beauty
and
the
mountain
she
called
hers
were
not
far
away
horses
in
plenty
and
a
luxurious
car
when
they
wanted
to
take
a
trip
journeys
east
as
often
as
they
wished
some
of
the
ideal
appliances
for
the
school
that
margaret
loved
a
church
for
the
missionary
and
convenient
halls
where
he
could
speak
at
his
outlying
districts
a
trip
to
the
city
for
mom
wallis
where
she
might
see
a
real
her
one
expressed
desire
this
side
of
heaven
now
that
she
had
taken
to
reading
browning
and
had
some
of
it
explained
to
her
oh
and
a
lot
of
wonderful
things
these
all
hung
in
the
before
eyes
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
with
that
bit
of
yellow
paper
in
his
hand
he
thought
of
what
that
money
had
represented
to
him
in
the
past
reckless
days
and
nights
of
folly
as
a
boy
and
young
man
at
college
ruthless
waste
of
time
money
youth
shriveling
of
soul
till
margaret
came
and
found
and
rescued
him
how
wonderful
that
he
had
been
rescued
that
he
had
come
to
his
senses
at
last
and
was
here
in
a
position
doing
a
man
work
in
the
world
now
with
all
that
money
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
work
and
earn
more
he
could
live
idly
all
his
days
and
just
have
a
good
time
make
others
happy
too
but
still
he
would
not
have
this
exhilarating
feeling
that
he
was
supplying
his
own
and
margaret
necessities
by
the
labor
of
hand
and
brain
the
little
telegram
in
his
hand
seemed
somehow
to
be
trying
to
snatch
from
him
all
this
material
prosperity
that
was
the
symbol
of
that
spiritual
regeneration
which
had
become
so
dear
to
him
he
put
his
head
down
on
his
clasped
hands
upon
the
desk
then
and
prayed
perhaps
it
was
the
first
great
prayer
of
his
life
o
god
let
me
be
strong
enough
to
stand
this
that
has
come
upon
me
help
me
to
be
a
man
in
spite
of
money
do
let
me
lose
my
manhood
and
my
right
to
work
help
me
to
use
the
money
in
the
right
way
and
not
to
dwarf
myself
nor
spoil
our
lives
with
it
it
was
a
great
prayer
for
a
man
such
as
gardley
had
been
and
the
answer
came
swiftly
in
his
conviction
he
lifted
up
his
head
with
purpose
in
his
expression
and
folding
the
telegram
put
it
safely
back
into
his
pocket
he
would
not
tell
margaret
of
it
not
just
yet
he
would
think
it
out
just
the
right
way
and
he
did
not
believe
he
meant
to
give
up
his
position
with
rogers
he
had
accepted
it
for
a
year
in
good
faith
and
it
was
his
business
to
fulfil
the
contract
meantime
this
money
would
perhaps
make
possible
his
marriage
with
margaret
sooner
than
he
had
hoped
five
minutes
later
rogers
telephoned
to
the
office
i
decided
to
take
that
shipment
of
cattle
and
try
that
new
stock
provided
you
will
go
out
and
look
at
them
and
see
that
everything
is
all
i
could
go
myself
now
do
feel
like
going
anywhere
you
know
you
would
need
to
go
for
a
couple
of
weeks
i
just
had
a
letter
from
the
man
and
he
says
he
wo
be
ready
sooner
say
why
do
you
and
miss
earle
get
married
and
make
this
a
she
could
go
to
the
pacific
coast
with
you
it
would
be
a
nice
trip
then
i
could
spare
you
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
when
you
got
back
if
you
wanted
to
take
her
east
for
a
little
visit
why
not
gardley
stumbled
out
his
thanks
and
hung
up
the
receiver
his
face
full
of
the
light
of
a
great
joy
how
were
the
blessings
pouring
down
upon
his
head
these
days
was
it
a
sign
that
god
was
pleased
with
his
action
in
making
good
what
he
could
where
he
had
failed
and
rogers
how
kind
he
was
poor
rogers
with
his
broken
heart
and
his
stricken
home
for
rosa
had
come
home
again
a
sadder
wiser
child
and
her
father
seemed
crushed
with
the
disgrace
of
it
all
gardley
went
to
margaret
that
very
afternoon
he
told
her
only
that
he
had
had
some
money
left
him
by
his
uncle
which
would
make
it
possible
for
him
to
marry
at
once
and
keep
her
comfortably
now
he
was
to
be
sent
to
california
on
a
business
trip
would
she
be
married
and
go
with
him
margaret
studied
the
telegram
in
wonder
she
had
never
asked
gardley
much
about
his
circumstances
the
telegram
merely
stated
that
his
uncle
estate
was
left
to
him
to
her
simple
mind
an
estate
might
be
a
few
hundred
dollars
enough
to
furnish
a
plain
little
home
and
her
face
lighted
with
joy
over
it
she
asked
no
questions
and
gardley
said
no
more
about
the
money
he
had
forgotten
that
question
comparatively
in
the
greater
possibility
of
joy
would
she
be
married
in
ten
days
and
go
with
him
her
eyes
met
his
with
an
answering
joy
and
yet
he
could
see
that
there
was
a
trouble
hiding
somewhere
he
presently
saw
what
it
was
without
needing
to
be
told
her
father
and
mother
of
course
they
would
be
disappointed
they
would
want
her
to
be
married
at
home
but
rogers
said
we
could
go
and
visit
them
for
several
weeks
on
our
return
he
said
and
margaret
face
lighted
up
oh
that
would
be
beautiful
she
said
wistfully
and
perhaps
they
wo
mind
so
much
though
i
always
expected
father
would
marry
me
if
i
was
ever
married
still
if
we
can
go
home
so
soon
and
for
so
long
and
brownleigh
would
be
next
best
of
course
but
of
course
your
father
must
marry
you
said
gardley
determinedly
perhaps
we
could
persuade
him
to
come
and
your
mother
too
oh
no
they
could
possibly
said
margaret
quickly
a
shade
of
sadness
in
her
eyes
you
know
it
costs
a
lot
to
come
out
here
and
ministers
are
never
rich
it
was
then
that
gardley
eyes
lighted
with
joy
his
money
could
take
this
bugbear
away
at
least
however
he
said
nothing
about
the
money
suppose
we
write
to
your
father
and
mother
and
put
the
matter
before
them
see
what
they
say
we
send
the
letters
you
write
your
mother
and
i
write
your
father
margaret
agreed
and
sat
down
at
once
to
write
her
letter
while
gardley
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
wrote
his
scratching
away
contentedly
with
his
and
looking
furtively
now
and
then
toward
the
bowed
head
over
at
the
desk
gardley
did
not
read
his
letter
to
margaret
she
wondered
a
little
at
this
but
did
not
ask
and
the
letters
were
mailed
with
stamps
on
them
gardley
awaited
their
replies
with
great
impatience
he
filled
in
the
days
of
waiting
with
business
there
were
letters
to
write
connected
with
his
fortune
and
there
were
arrangements
to
be
made
for
his
trip
but
the
thing
that
occupied
the
most
of
his
time
and
thought
was
the
purchase
and
refitting
of
a
roomy
old
in
a
charming
location
not
more
than
three
miles
from
ashland
on
the
road
to
the
camp
it
had
been
vacant
for
a
couple
of
years
past
the
owner
having
gone
abroad
permanently
and
the
place
having
been
offered
for
sale
margaret
had
often
admired
it
in
her
trips
to
and
from
the
camp
and
gardley
thought
of
it
at
once
when
it
became
possible
for
him
to
think
of
purchasing
a
home
in
the
west
there
was
a
great
stone
fireplace
and
the
beams
of
the
ceilings
and
pillars
of
the
porch
and
wide
hospitable
rooms
were
of
with
the
bark
on
them
with
a
little
work
it
could
be
made
roughly
but
artistically
habitable
gardley
had
it
cleaned
up
not
disturbing
the
tangle
of
vines
and
shrubbery
that
had
had
their
way
since
the
last
owner
had
left
them
and
which
had
made
a
perfect
screen
from
the
road
for
the
house
behind
this
screen
the
men
worked
most
of
them
the
men
from
the
whom
gardley
took
into
his
confidence
the
floors
were
carefully
scrubbed
under
the
direction
of
mom
wallis
and
the
windows
made
shining
then
the
men
spent
a
day
bringing
great
loads
of
and
filling
the
place
with
green
fragrance
until
the
big
looked
like
a
woodland
bower
gardley
made
a
raid
upon
some
indian
friends
of
his
and
came
back
with
several
fine
navajo
rugs
and
blankets
which
he
spread
about
the
room
luxuriously
on
the
floor
and
over
the
rude
benches
which
the
men
had
constructed
they
piled
the
fireplace
with
big
logs
and
gardley
took
over
some
of
his
own
personal
possessions
that
he
had
brought
back
from
the
east
with
him
to
give
the
place
a
livable
look
then
he
stood
back
satisfied
the
place
was
fit
to
bring
his
bride
and
her
friends
to
not
that
it
was
as
it
should
be
that
would
be
for
margaret
to
do
but
it
would
serve
as
a
temporary
if
there
came
need
if
no
need
came
why
the
place
was
there
anyway
hers
and
his
a
tender
light
grew
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
it
over
in
the
dying
light
of
the
afternoon
then
he
went
out
and
rode
swiftly
to
the
and
found
these
two
telegrams
according
to
the
request
in
his
own
letter
to
earle
gardley
telegram
read
congratulations
will
come
as
you
desire
we
await
your
advice
have
father
he
saddled
his
horse
and
hurried
to
margaret
with
hers
and
together
they
read
dear
child
so
glad
for
you
of
course
you
will
go
i
am
sending
you
some
things
do
take
a
thought
for
us
we
shall
look
forward
to
your
visit
our
love
to
you
mother
margaret
folded
in
her
lover
arms
cried
out
her
sorrow
and
her
joy
and
lifted
up
her
face
with
happiness
then
gardley
with
great
joy
thought
of
the
surprise
he
had
in
store
for
her
and
laid
his
face
against
hers
to
hide
the
telltale
smile
in
his
eyes
for
gardley
in
his
letter
to
his
future
had
written
of
his
newly
inherited
fortune
and
had
not
only
inclosed
a
check
for
a
good
sum
to
cover
all
extra
expense
of
the
journey
but
had
said
that
a
private
car
would
be
at
their
disposal
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
any
of
margaret
friends
and
relatives
whom
they
might
choose
to
invite
as
he
had
written
this
letter
he
was
filled
with
deep
thanksgiving
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
this
thing
for
his
dear
the
morning
after
the
telegrams
arrived
gardley
spent
several
hours
writing
telegrams
and
receiving
them
from
a
big
department
store
in
the
nearest
great
city
and
before
noon
a
big
shipment
of
goods
was
on
its
way
to
ashland
beds
bureaus
chairs
tables
dishes
kitchen
utensils
and
all
kinds
of
bedding
even
to
sheets
and
he
ordered
with
lavish
hand
after
all
he
must
furnish
the
house
himself
and
let
margaret
weed
it
out
or
give
it
away
afterward
if
she
did
not
like
it
he
was
going
to
have
a
house
party
and
he
must
be
ready
when
all
was
done
and
he
was
just
about
to
mount
his
horse
again
he
turned
back
and
sent
another
message
ordering
a
piano
why
it
he
said
to
himself
as
he
rode
back
to
his
office
it
simply
great
to
be
able
to
do
things
just
when
i
need
them
i
never
knew
what
fun
money
was
before
but
then
i
never
had
margaret
to
spend
it
for
and
she
worth
the
whole
of
it
at
once
the
next
thing
he
ordered
was
a
great
easy
carriage
with
plenty
of
room
to
convey
mother
earle
and
her
friends
from
the
train
to
the
house
the
days
went
by
rapidly
enough
and
margaret
was
so
busy
that
she
had
little
time
to
wonder
and
worry
why
her
mother
did
not
write
her
the
long
loving
motherly
letter
to
her
little
girlhood
that
she
had
expected
to
get
not
until
three
days
before
the
wedding
did
it
come
over
her
that
she
had
had
but
three
brief
scrappy
letters
from
her
mother
and
they
not
a
whole
page
apiece
what
could
be
the
matter
with
mother
she
was
almost
on
the
point
of
panic
when
gardley
came
and
bundled
her
on
to
her
horse
for
a
ride
strangely
enough
he
directed
their
way
through
ashland
and
down
to
the
station
and
it
was
just
about
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
evening
train
gardley
excused
himself
for
a
moment
saying
something
about
an
errand
and
went
into
the
station
margaret
sat
on
her
horse
watching
the
oncoming
train
the
great
connecting
link
between
east
and
west
and
wondered
if
it
would
bring
a
letter
from
mother
the
train
rushed
to
a
halt
and
behold
some
passengers
were
getting
off
from
a
private
car
margaret
watched
them
idly
thinking
more
about
an
expected
letter
than
about
the
people
then
suddenly
she
awoke
to
the
fact
that
gardley
was
greeting
them
who
could
they
be
there
were
five
of
them
and
one
of
them
looked
like
jane
dear
jane
she
had
forgotten
to
write
her
about
this
hurried
wedding
how
different
it
all
was
going
to
be
from
what
she
and
jane
had
planned
for
each
other
in
their
dear
old
dreams
and
that
young
man
that
gardley
was
shaking
hands
with
now
looked
like
cousin
dick
she
had
seen
him
for
three
years
but
he
must
look
like
that
now
and
the
younger
girl
beside
him
might
be
cousin
emily
but
oh
who
were
the
others
and
mother
margaret
sprang
from
her
horse
with
a
bound
and
rushed
into
her
arms
the
interested
passengers
craned
their
necks
and
looked
their
fill
with
smiles
of
appreciation
as
the
train
took
up
its
way
again
having
dropped
the
private
car
on
the
side
track
dick
and
emily
rode
the
ponies
to
the
house
while
margaret
nestled
in
the
back
seat
of
the
carriage
between
her
father
and
mother
and
jane
got
acquainted
with
gardley
in
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
margaret
never
even
noticed
where
they
were
going
until
the
carriage
turned
in
and
stopped
before
the
door
of
the
new
house
and
tanner
furtively
casting
behind
her
the
checked
apron
she
had
worn
came
out
to
shake
hands
with
the
company
and
tell
them
supper
was
all
ready
before
she
went
back
to
her
deserted
even
bud
was
going
to
stay
at
the
new
house
that
night
in
some
capacity
or
other
and
all
the
men
from
the
were
hiding
out
among
the
trees
to
see
margaret
father
and
mother
and
shake
hands
if
the
opportunity
offered
the
wonder
and
delight
of
margaret
when
she
saw
the
house
inside
and
knew
that
it
was
hers
the
tears
she
shed
and
smiles
that
grew
almost
into
hysterics
when
she
saw
some
of
the
incongruous
furnishings
are
all
past
describing
margaret
was
too
happy
to
think
she
rushed
from
one
room
to
another
she
hugged
her
mother
and
linked
her
arm
in
her
father
for
a
walk
across
the
long
piazza
she
talked
to
emily
and
dick
and
jane
and
then
rushed
out
to
find
gardley
and
thank
him
again
and
all
this
time
she
could
not
understand
how
gardley
had
done
it
for
she
had
not
yet
comprehended
his
fortune
gardley
had
asked
his
sisters
to
come
to
the
wedding
not
much
expecting
they
would
accept
but
they
had
telegraphed
at
the
last
minute
they
would
be
there
they
arrived
an
hour
or
so
before
the
ceremony
gushed
over
margaret
told
gardley
she
was
a
sweet
thing
said
the
house
was
dandy
for
a
house
party
if
one
had
plenty
of
servants
but
they
should
think
it
would
be
dull
in
winter
gave
margaret
a
diamond
sunburst
pin
a
string
of
pearls
and
an
emerald
bracelet
set
in
diamond
chips
and
departed
immediately
after
the
ceremony
they
had
thought
they
were
the
chief
guests
but
the
relief
that
overspread
the
faces
of
those
guests
who
were
best
beloved
by
both
bride
and
groom
was
at
once
visible
on
their
departure
jasper
kemp
drew
a
long
breath
and
declared
to
long
bill
that
he
was
glad
the
air
was
growing
pure
again
then
all
those
old
friends
from
the
filed
in
to
the
great
tables
heavily
loaded
with
good
things
the
abundant
gift
of
the
neighborhood
and
sat
down
to
the
wedding
supper
heartily
glad
that
the
city
lady
and
her
gals
as
mom
wallis
called
them
in
a
suppressed
whisper
had
chosen
not
to
stay
over
a
train
the
wedding
had
been
in
the
embowered
in
foliage
and
all
the
flowers
the
land
afforded
decorated
by
the
loving
hands
of
margaret
pupils
old
and
young
she
was
attended
by
the
entire
school
marching
double
file
before
her
strewing
flowers
in
her
way
the
missionary
wife
played
the
and
the
missionary
assisted
the
bride
father
with
the
ceremony
margaret
dress
was
a
simple
white
muslin
with
a
little
real
lace
and
embroidery
handed
down
from
former
generations
the
whole
called
into
being
by
margaret
mother
even
gardley
sisters
had
said
it
was
perfectly
dear
the
whole
neighborhood
was
at
the
wedding
and
when
the
bountiful
was
eaten
the
entire
company
of
favored
guests
stood
about
the
new
piano
and
sang
blest
be
the
tie
that
binds
with
margaret
playing
for
them
then
there
was
a
little
hurry
at
the
last
margaret
getting
into
the
pretty
traveling
dress
and
hat
her
mother
had
brought
and
kissing
her
mother
though
happily
not
for
long
this
time
mother
and
father
and
the
rest
of
the
home
party
were
to
wait
until
morning
and
the
missionary
and
his
wife
were
to
stay
with
them
that
night
and
see
them
to
their
car
the
next
day
so
waving
and
throwing
kisses
back
to
the
others
they
rode
away
to
the
station
bud
pridefully
driving
the
team
from
the
front
seat
gardley
had
arranged
for
a
private
apartment
on
the
train
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
luxurious
in
traveling
than
the
place
where
he
led
his
bride
bud
scuttling
behind
with
a
looked
around
him
with
all
his
eyes
before
he
said
a
hurried
and
murmured
under
his
breath
gee
wisht
i
was
goin
all
the
way
bud
hustled
off
as
the
train
got
under
way
and
margaret
and
gardley
went
out
to
the
observation
platform
to
wave
a
last
farewell
the
few
little
blurring
lights
of
ashland
died
soon
in
the
distance
and
the
desert
took
on
its
vast
wideness
beneath
a
starry
dome
but
off
in
the
east
a
purple
shadow
loomed
mighty
and
majestic
and
rising
slowly
over
its
crest
a
great
silver
disk
appeared
brightening
as
it
came
and
pouring
a
silver
mist
over
the
purple
peak
my
mountain
said
margaret
softly
and
gardley
drawing
her
close
to
him
stooped
to
lay
his
lips
upon
hers
my
darling
he
answered
the
end
