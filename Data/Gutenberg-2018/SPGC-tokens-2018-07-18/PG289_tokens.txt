the

i
the
river
bank
the
mole
had
been
working
very
hard
all
the
morning
his
little
home
first
with
brooms
then
with
dusters
then
on
ladders
and
steps
and
chairs
with
a
brush
and
a
pail
of
whitewash
till
he
had
dust
in
his
throat
and
eyes
and
splashes
of
whitewash
all
over
his
black
fur
and
an
aching
back
and
weary
arms
spring
was
moving
in
the
air
above
and
in
the
earth
below
and
around
him
penetrating
even
his
dark
and
lowly
little
house
with
its
spirit
of
divine
discontent
and
longing
it
was
small
wonder
then
that
he
suddenly
flung
down
his
brush
on
the
floor
said
bother
and
o
blow
and
also
hang
and
bolted
out
of
the
house
without
even
waiting
to
put
on
his
coat
something
up
above
was
calling
him
imperiously
and
he
made
for
the
steep
little
tunnel
which
answered
in
his
case
to
the
gravelled
owned
by
animals
whose
residences
are
nearer
to
the
sun
and
air
so
he
scraped
and
scratched
and
scrabbled
and
scrooged
and
then
he
scrooged
again
and
scrabbled
and
scratched
and
scraped
working
busily
with
his
little
paws
and
muttering
to
himself
up
we
go
up
we
go
till
at
last
pop
his
snout
came
out
into
the
sunlight
and
he
found
himself
rolling
in
the
warm
grass
of
a
great
meadow
this
is
fine
he
said
to
himself
this
is
better
than
whitewashing
the
sunshine
struck
hot
on
his
fur
soft
breezes
caressed
his
heated
brow
and
after
the
seclusion
of
the
cellarage
he
had
lived
in
so
long
the
carol
of
happy
birds
fell
on
his
dulled
hearing
almost
like
a
shout
jumping
off
all
his
four
legs
at
once
in
the
joy
of
living
and
the
delight
of
spring
without
its
cleaning
he
pursued
his
way
across
the
meadow
till
he
reached
the
hedge
on
the
further
side
hold
up
said
an
elderly
rabbit
at
the
gap
sixpence
for
the
privilege
of
passing
by
the
private
road
he
was
bowled
over
in
an
instant
by
the
impatient
and
contemptuous
mole
who
trotted
along
the
side
of
the
hedge
chaffing
the
other
rabbits
as
they
peeped
hurriedly
from
their
holes
to
see
what
the
row
was
about
he
remarked
jeeringly
and
was
gone
before
they
could
think
of
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
reply
then
they
all
started
grumbling
at
each
other
how
stupid
you
are
why
didn
t
you
tell
him
well
why
didn
t
you
say
you
might
have
reminded
him
and
so
on
in
the
usual
way
but
of
course
it
was
then
much
too
late
as
is
always
the
case
it
all
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
hither
and
thither
through
the
meadows
he
rambled
busily
along
the
hedgerows
across
the
copses
finding
everywhere
birds
building
flowers
budding
leaves
thrusting
everything
happy
and
progressive
and
occupied
and
instead
of
having
an
uneasy
conscience
pricking
him
and
whispering
whitewash
he
somehow
could
only
feel
how
jolly
it
was
to
be
the
only
idle
dog
among
all
these
busy
citizens
after
all
the
best
part
of
a
holiday
is
perhaps
not
so
much
to
be
resting
yourself
as
to
see
all
the
other
fellows
busy
working
he
thought
his
happiness
was
complete
when
as
he
meandered
aimlessly
along
suddenly
he
stood
by
the
edge
of
a
river
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
a
river
before
this
sleek
sinuous
animal
chasing
and
chuckling
gripping
things
with
a
gurgle
and
leaving
them
with
a
laugh
to
fling
itself
on
fresh
playmates
that
shook
themselves
free
and
were
caught
and
held
again
all
was
and
glints
and
gleams
and
sparkles
rustle
and
swirl
chatter
and
bubble
the
mole
was
bewitched
entranced
fascinated
by
the
side
of
the
river
he
trotted
as
one
trots
when
very
small
by
the
side
of
a
man
who
holds
one
by
exciting
stories
and
when
tired
at
last
he
sat
on
the
bank
while
the
river
still
chattered
on
to
him
a
babbling
procession
of
the
best
stories
in
the
world
sent
from
the
heart
of
the
earth
to
be
told
at
last
to
the
insatiable
sea
as
he
sat
on
the
grass
and
looked
across
the
river
a
dark
hole
in
the
bank
opposite
just
above
the
water
s
edge
caught
his
eye
and
dreamily
he
fell
to
considering
what
a
nice
snug
it
would
make
for
an
animal
with
few
wants
and
fond
of
a
bijou
riverside
residence
above
flood
level
and
remote
from
noise
and
dust
as
he
gazed
something
bright
and
small
seemed
to
twinkle
down
in
the
heart
of
it
vanished
then
twinkled
once
more
like
a
tiny
star
but
it
could
hardly
be
a
star
in
such
an
unlikely
situation
and
it
was
too
glittering
and
small
for
a
then
as
he
looked
it
winked
at
him
and
so
declared
itself
to
be
an
eye
and
a
small
face
began
gradually
to
grow
up
round
it
like
a
frame
round
a
picture
a
brown
little
face
with
whiskers
a
grave
round
face
with
the
same
twinkle
in
its
eye
that
had
first
attracted
his
notice
small
neat
ears
and
thick
silky
hair
it
was
the
water
rat
then
the
two
animals
stood
and
regarded
each
other
cautiously
hullo
mole
said
the
water
rat
hullo
rat
said
the
mole
would
you
like
to
come
over
enquired
the
rat
presently
oh
its
all
very
well
to
talk
said
the
mole
rather
pettishly
he
being
new
to
a
river
and
riverside
life
and
its
ways
the
rat
said
nothing
but
stooped
and
unfastened
a
rope
and
hauled
on
it
then
lightly
stepped
into
a
little
boat
which
the
mole
had
not
observed
it
was
painted
blue
outside
and
white
within
and
was
just
the
size
for
two
animals
and
the
mole
s
whole
heart
went
out
to
it
at
once
even
though
he
did
not
yet
fully
understand
its
uses
the
rat
sculled
smartly
across
and
made
fast
then
he
held
up
his
forepaw
as
the
mole
stepped
gingerly
down
lean
on
that
he
said
now
then
step
lively
and
the
mole
to
his
surprise
and
rapture
found
himself
actually
seated
in
the
stern
of
a
real
boat
this
has
been
a
wonderful
day
said
he
as
the
rat
shoved
off
and
took
to
the
sculls
again
do
you
know
i
ve
never
been
in
a
boat
before
in
all
my
what
cried
the
rat
never
been
in
a
you
never
well
i
what
have
you
been
doing
then
is
it
so
nice
as
all
that
asked
the
mole
shyly
though
he
was
quite
prepared
to
believe
it
as
he
leant
back
in
his
seat
and
surveyed
the
cushions
the
oars
the
rowlocks
and
all
the
fascinating
fittings
and
felt
the
boat
sway
lightly
under
him
nice
it
s
the
only
thing
said
the
water
rat
solemnly
as
he
leant
forward
for
his
stroke
believe
me
my
young
friend
there
is
nothing
absolute
nothing
half
so
much
worth
doing
as
simply
messing
about
in
boats
simply
messing
he
went
on
dreamily
messing
about
in
boats
messing
look
ahead
rat
cried
the
mole
suddenly
it
was
too
late
the
boat
struck
the
bank
full
tilt
the
dreamer
the
joyous
oarsman
lay
on
his
back
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
his
heels
in
the
air
about
in
boats
or
with
boats
the
rat
went
on
composedly
picking
himself
up
with
a
pleasant
laugh
in
or
out
of
em
it
doesn
t
matter
nothing
seems
really
to
matter
that
s
the
charm
of
it
whether
you
get
away
or
whether
you
don
t
whether
you
arrive
at
your
destination
or
whether
you
reach
somewhere
else
or
whether
you
never
get
anywhere
at
all
you
re
always
busy
and
you
never
do
anything
in
particular
and
when
you
ve
done
it
there
s
always
something
else
to
do
and
you
can
do
it
if
you
like
but
you
d
much
better
not
look
here
if
you
ve
really
nothing
else
on
hand
this
morning
supposing
we
drop
down
the
river
together
and
have
a
long
day
of
it
the
mole
waggled
his
toes
from
sheer
happiness
spread
his
chest
with
a
sigh
of
full
contentment
and
leaned
back
blissfully
into
the
soft
cushions
what
a
day
i
m
having
he
said
let
us
start
at
once
hold
hard
a
minute
then
said
the
rat
he
looped
the
painter
through
a
ring
in
his
climbed
up
into
his
hole
above
and
after
a
short
interval
reappeared
staggering
under
a
fat
wicker
shove
that
under
your
feet
he
observed
to
the
mole
as
he
passed
it
down
into
the
boat
then
he
untied
the
painter
and
took
the
sculls
again
what
s
inside
it
asked
the
mole
wriggling
with
curiosity
there
s
cold
chicken
inside
it
replied
the
rat
briefly
dwichespottedmeatgingerbeerlemonadesodawater
o
stop
stop
cried
the
mole
in
ecstacies
this
is
too
much
do
you
really
think
so
enquired
the
rat
seriously
it
s
only
what
i
always
take
on
these
little
excursions
and
the
other
animals
are
always
telling
me
that
i
m
a
mean
beast
and
cut
it
very
fine
the
mole
never
heard
a
word
he
was
saying
absorbed
in
the
new
life
he
was
entering
upon
intoxicated
with
the
sparkle
the
ripple
the
scents
and
the
sounds
and
the
sunlight
he
trailed
a
paw
in
the
water
and
dreamed
long
waking
dreams
the
water
rat
like
the
good
little
fellow
he
was
sculled
steadily
on
and
forebore
to
disturb
him
i
like
your
clothes
awfully
old
chap
he
remarked
after
some
half
an
hour
or
so
had
passed
i
m
going
to
get
a
black
velvet
myself
some
day
as
soon
as
i
can
afford
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
mole
pulling
himself
together
with
an
effort
you
must
think
me
very
rude
but
all
this
is
so
new
to
me
so
this
is
a
river
the
river
corrected
the
rat
and
you
really
live
by
the
river
what
a
jolly
life
by
it
and
with
it
and
on
it
and
in
it
said
the
rat
it
s
brother
and
sister
to
me
and
aunts
and
company
and
food
and
drink
and
naturally
washing
it
s
my
world
and
i
don
t
want
any
other
what
it
hasn
t
got
is
not
worth
having
and
what
it
doesn
t
know
is
not
worth
knowing
lord
the
times
we
ve
had
together
whether
in
winter
or
summer
spring
or
autumn
it
s
always
got
its
fun
and
its
excitements
when
the
floods
are
on
in
february
and
my
cellars
and
basement
are
brimming
with
drink
that
s
no
good
to
me
and
the
brown
water
runs
by
my
best
bedroom
window
or
again
when
it
all
drops
away
and
shows
patches
of
mud
that
smells
like
and
the
rushes
and
weed
clog
the
channels
and
i
can
potter
about
dry
shod
over
most
of
the
bed
of
it
and
find
fresh
food
to
eat
and
things
careless
people
have
dropped
out
of
boats
but
isn
t
it
a
bit
dull
at
times
the
mole
ventured
to
ask
just
you
and
the
river
and
no
one
else
to
pass
a
word
with
no
one
else
to
well
i
mustn
t
be
hard
on
you
said
the
rat
with
forbearance
you
re
new
to
it
and
of
course
you
don
t
know
the
bank
is
so
crowded
nowadays
that
many
people
are
moving
away
altogether
o
no
it
isn
t
what
it
used
to
be
at
all
otters
kingfishers
dabchicks
moorhens
all
of
them
about
all
day
long
and
always
wanting
you
to
do
something
as
if
a
fellow
had
no
business
of
his
own
to
attend
to
what
lies
over
there
asked
the
mole
waving
a
paw
towards
a
background
of
woodland
that
darkly
framed
the
on
one
side
of
the
river
that
o
that
s
just
the
wild
wood
said
the
rat
shortly
we
don
t
go
there
very
much
we
aren
t
they
aren
t
they
very
nice
people
in
there
said
the
mole
a
trifle
nervously
replied
the
rat
let
me
see
the
squirrels
are
all
right
and
the
rabbits
some
of
em
but
rabbits
are
a
mixed
lot
and
then
there
s
badger
of
course
he
lives
right
in
the
heart
of
it
wouldn
t
live
anywhere
else
either
if
you
paid
him
to
do
it
dear
old
badger
nobody
interferes
with
him
they
d
better
not
he
added
significantly
why
who
should
interfere
with
him
asked
the
mole
well
of
course
there
are
others
explained
the
rat
in
a
hesitating
sort
of
way
weasels
and
stoats
and
foxes
and
so
on
they
re
all
right
in
a
way
i
m
very
good
friends
with
them
pass
the
time
of
day
when
we
meet
and
all
that
but
they
break
out
sometimes
there
s
no
denying
it
and
then
well
you
can
t
really
trust
them
and
that
s
the
the
mole
knew
well
that
it
is
quite
against
to
dwell
on
possible
trouble
ahead
or
even
to
allude
to
it
so
he
dropped
the
subject
and
beyond
the
wild
wood
again
he
asked
where
it
s
all
blue
and
dim
and
one
sees
what
may
be
hills
or
perhaps
they
mayn
t
and
something
like
the
smoke
of
towns
or
is
it
only
beyond
the
wild
wood
comes
the
wide
world
said
the
rat
and
that
s
something
that
doesn
t
matter
either
to
you
or
me
i
ve
never
been
there
and
i
m
never
going
nor
you
either
if
you
ve
got
any
sense
at
all
don
t
ever
refer
to
it
again
please
now
then
here
s
our
backwater
at
last
where
we
re
going
to
leaving
the
main
stream
they
now
passed
into
what
seemed
at
first
sight
like
a
little
lake
green
turf
sloped
down
to
either
edge
brown
snaky
gleamed
below
the
surface
of
the
quiet
water
while
ahead
of
them
the
silvery
shoulder
and
foamy
tumble
of
a
weir
with
a
restless
dripping
that
held
up
in
its
turn
a
filled
the
air
with
a
soothing
murmur
of
sound
dull
and
smothery
yet
with
little
clear
voices
speaking
up
cheerfully
out
of
it
at
intervals
it
was
so
very
beautiful
that
the
mole
could
only
hold
up
both
forepaws
and
gasp
o
my
o
my
o
my
the
rat
brought
the
boat
alongside
the
bank
made
her
fast
helped
the
still
awkward
mole
safely
ashore
and
swung
out
the
the
mole
begged
as
a
favour
to
be
allowed
to
unpack
it
all
by
himself
and
the
rat
was
very
pleased
to
indulge
him
and
to
sprawl
at
full
length
on
the
grass
and
rest
while
his
excited
friend
shook
out
the
and
spread
it
took
out
all
the
mysterious
packets
one
by
one
and
arranged
their
contents
in
due
order
still
gasping
o
my
o
my
at
each
fresh
revelation
when
all
was
ready
the
rat
said
now
pitch
in
old
fellow
and
the
mole
was
indeed
very
glad
to
obey
for
he
had
started
his
at
a
very
early
hour
that
morning
as
people
will
do
and
had
not
paused
for
bite
or
sup
and
he
had
been
through
a
very
great
deal
since
that
distant
time
which
now
seemed
so
many
days
ago
what
are
you
looking
at
said
the
rat
presently
when
the
edge
of
their
hunger
was
somewhat
dulled
and
the
mole
s
eyes
were
able
to
wander
off
the
a
little
i
am
looking
said
the
mole
at
a
streak
of
bubbles
that
i
see
travelling
along
the
surface
of
the
water
that
is
a
thing
that
strikes
me
as
bubbles
oho
said
the
rat
and
chirruped
cheerily
in
an
inviting
sort
of
way
a
broad
glistening
muzzle
showed
itself
above
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
the
otter
hauled
himself
out
and
shook
the
water
from
his
coat
greedy
beggars
he
observed
making
for
the
provender
why
didn
t
you
invite
me
ratty
this
was
an
impromptu
affair
explained
the
rat
by
the
way
my
friend
proud
i
m
sure
said
the
otter
and
the
two
animals
were
friends
forthwith
such
a
rumpus
everywhere
continued
the
otter
all
the
world
seems
out
on
the
river
i
came
up
this
backwater
to
try
and
get
a
moment
s
peace
and
then
stumble
upon
you
fellows
at
least
i
beg
pardon
i
don
t
exactly
mean
that
you
there
was
a
rustle
behind
them
proceeding
from
a
hedge
wherein
last
year
s
leaves
still
clung
thick
and
a
stripy
head
with
high
shoulders
behind
it
peered
forth
on
them
come
on
old
badger
shouted
the
rat
the
badger
trotted
forward
a
pace
or
two
then
grunted
h
m
company
and
turned
his
back
and
disappeared
from
view
that
s
just
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
observed
the
disappointed
rat
simply
hates
society
now
we
shan
t
see
any
more
of
him
well
tell
us
who
s
out
on
the
river
toad
s
out
for
one
replied
the
otter
in
his
new
togs
new
everything
the
two
animals
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
once
it
was
nothing
but
sailing
said
the
rat
then
he
tired
of
that
and
took
to
punting
nothing
would
please
him
but
to
punt
all
day
and
every
day
and
a
nice
mess
he
made
of
it
last
year
it
was
and
we
all
had
to
go
and
stay
with
him
in
his
and
pretend
we
liked
it
he
was
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
a
it
s
all
the
same
whatever
he
takes
up
he
gets
tired
of
it
and
starts
on
something
such
a
good
fellow
too
remarked
the
otter
reflectively
but
no
stability
especially
in
a
boat
from
where
they
sat
they
could
get
a
glimpse
of
the
main
stream
across
the
island
that
separated
them
and
just
then
a
flashed
into
view
the
rower
a
short
stout
figure
splashing
badly
and
rolling
a
good
deal
but
working
his
hardest
the
rat
stood
up
and
hailed
him
but
toad
for
it
was
he
shook
his
head
and
settled
sternly
to
his
work
he
ll
be
out
of
the
boat
in
a
minute
if
he
rolls
like
that
said
the
rat
sitting
down
again
of
course
he
will
chuckled
the
otter
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
good
story
about
toad
and
the
it
happened
this
way
toad
an
errant
swerved
unsteadily
athwart
the
current
in
the
intoxicated
fashion
affected
by
young
bloods
of
seeing
life
a
swirl
of
water
and
a
cloop
and
the
was
visible
no
more
neither
was
the
otter
the
mole
looked
down
the
voice
was
still
in
his
ears
but
the
turf
whereon
he
had
sprawled
was
clearly
vacant
not
an
otter
to
be
seen
as
far
as
the
distant
horizon
but
again
there
was
a
streak
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
river
the
rat
hummed
a
tune
and
the
mole
recollected
that
forbade
any
sort
of
comment
on
the
sudden
disappearance
of
one
s
friends
at
any
moment
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
whatever
well
well
said
the
rat
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
moving
i
wonder
which
of
us
had
better
pack
the
he
did
not
speak
as
if
he
was
frightfully
eager
for
the
treat
o
please
let
me
said
the
mole
so
of
course
the
rat
let
him
packing
the
basket
was
not
quite
such
pleasant
work
as
unpacking
the
basket
it
never
is
but
the
mole
was
bent
on
enjoying
everything
and
although
just
when
he
had
got
the
basket
packed
and
strapped
up
tightly
he
saw
a
plate
staring
up
at
him
from
the
grass
and
when
the
job
had
been
done
again
the
rat
pointed
out
a
fork
which
anybody
ought
to
have
seen
and
last
of
all
behold
the
mustard
pot
which
he
had
been
sitting
on
without
knowing
it
still
somehow
the
thing
got
finished
at
last
without
much
loss
of
temper
the
afternoon
sun
was
getting
low
as
the
rat
sculled
gently
homewards
in
a
dreamy
mood
murmuring
over
to
himself
and
not
paying
much
attention
to
mole
but
the
mole
was
very
full
of
lunch
and
and
pride
and
already
quite
at
home
in
a
boat
so
he
thought
and
was
getting
a
bit
restless
besides
and
presently
he
said
ratty
please
want
to
row
now
the
rat
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
not
yet
my
young
friend
he
said
wait
till
you
ve
had
a
few
lessons
it
s
not
so
easy
as
it
the
mole
was
quiet
for
a
minute
or
two
but
he
began
to
feel
more
and
more
jealous
of
rat
sculling
so
strongly
and
so
easily
along
and
his
pride
began
to
whisper
that
he
could
do
it
every
bit
as
well
he
jumped
up
and
seized
the
sculls
so
suddenly
that
the
rat
who
was
gazing
out
over
the
water
and
saying
more
to
himself
was
taken
by
surprise
and
fell
backwards
off
his
seat
with
his
legs
in
the
air
for
the
second
time
while
the
triumphant
mole
took
his
place
and
grabbed
the
sculls
with
entire
confidence
stop
it
you
silly
ass
cried
the
rat
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
you
can
t
do
it
you
ll
have
us
over
the
mole
flung
his
sculls
back
with
a
flourish
and
made
a
great
dig
at
the
water
he
missed
the
surface
altogether
his
legs
flew
up
above
his
head
and
he
found
himself
lying
on
the
top
of
the
prostrate
rat
greatly
alarmed
he
made
a
grab
at
the
side
of
the
boat
and
the
next
moment
sploosh
over
went
the
boat
and
he
found
himself
struggling
in
the
river
o
my
how
cold
the
water
was
and
o
how
very
wet
it
felt
how
it
sang
in
his
ears
as
he
went
down
down
down
how
bright
and
welcome
the
sun
looked
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
coughing
and
spluttering
how
black
was
his
despair
when
he
felt
himself
sinking
again
then
a
firm
paw
gripped
him
by
the
back
of
his
neck
it
was
the
rat
and
he
was
evidently
laughing
the
mole
could
feel
him
laughing
right
down
his
arm
and
through
his
paw
and
so
into
his
the
mole
s
neck
the
rat
got
hold
of
a
scull
and
shoved
it
under
the
mole
s
arm
then
he
did
the
same
by
the
other
side
of
him
and
swimming
behind
propelled
the
helpless
animal
to
shore
hauled
him
out
and
set
him
down
on
the
bank
a
squashy
pulpy
lump
of
misery
when
the
rat
had
rubbed
him
down
a
bit
and
wrung
some
of
the
wet
out
of
him
he
said
now
then
old
fellow
trot
up
and
down
the
as
hard
as
you
can
till
you
re
warm
and
dry
again
while
i
dive
for
the
so
the
dismal
mole
wet
without
and
ashamed
within
trotted
about
till
he
was
fairly
dry
while
the
rat
plunged
into
the
water
again
recovered
the
boat
righted
her
and
made
her
fast
fetched
his
floating
property
to
shore
by
degrees
and
finally
dived
successfully
for
the
and
struggled
to
land
with
it
when
all
was
ready
for
a
start
once
more
the
mole
limp
and
dejected
took
his
seat
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
as
they
set
off
he
said
in
a
low
voice
broken
with
emotion
ratty
my
generous
friend
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
for
my
foolish
and
ungrateful
conduct
my
heart
quite
fails
me
when
i
think
how
i
might
have
lost
that
beautiful
indeed
i
have
been
a
complete
ass
and
i
know
it
will
you
overlook
it
this
once
and
forgive
me
and
let
things
go
on
as
before
that
s
all
right
bless
you
responded
the
rat
cheerily
what
s
a
little
wet
to
a
water
rat
i
m
more
in
the
water
than
out
of
it
most
days
don
t
you
think
any
more
about
it
and
look
here
i
really
think
you
had
better
come
and
stop
with
me
for
a
little
time
it
s
very
plain
and
rough
you
know
not
like
toad
s
house
at
all
but
you
haven
t
seen
that
yet
still
i
can
make
you
comfortable
and
i
ll
teach
you
to
row
and
to
swim
and
you
ll
soon
be
as
handy
on
the
water
as
any
of
the
mole
was
so
touched
by
his
kind
manner
of
speaking
that
he
could
find
no
voice
to
answer
him
and
he
had
to
brush
away
a
tear
or
two
with
the
back
of
his
paw
but
the
rat
kindly
looked
in
another
direction
and
presently
the
mole
s
spirits
revived
again
and
he
was
even
able
to
give
some
straight
to
a
couple
of
moorhens
who
were
sniggering
to
each
other
about
his
bedraggled
appearance
when
they
got
home
the
rat
made
a
bright
fire
in
the
parlour
and
planted
the
mole
in
an
in
front
of
it
having
fetched
down
a
and
slippers
for
him
and
told
him
river
stories
till
very
thrilling
stories
they
were
too
to
an
animal
like
mole
stories
about
weirs
and
sudden
floods
and
leaping
pike
and
steamers
that
flung
hard
bottles
at
least
bottles
were
certainly
flung
and
from
steamers
so
presumably
by
them
and
about
herons
and
how
particular
they
were
whom
they
spoke
to
and
about
adventures
down
drains
and
with
otter
or
excursions
far
with
badger
supper
was
a
most
cheerful
meal
but
very
shortly
afterwards
a
terribly
sleepy
mole
had
to
be
escorted
upstairs
by
his
considerate
host
to
the
best
bedroom
where
he
soon
laid
his
head
on
his
pillow
in
great
peace
and
contentment
knowing
that
his
friend
the
river
was
lapping
the
sill
of
his
window
this
day
was
only
the
first
of
many
similar
ones
for
the
emancipated
mole
each
of
them
longer
and
full
of
interest
as
the
ripening
summer
moved
onward
he
learnt
to
swim
and
to
row
and
entered
into
the
joy
of
running
water
and
with
his
ear
to
the
he
caught
at
intervals
something
of
what
the
wind
went
whispering
so
constantly
among
them
ii
the
open
road
ratty
said
the
mole
suddenly
one
bright
summer
morning
if
you
please
i
want
to
ask
you
a
the
rat
was
sitting
on
the
river
bank
singing
a
little
song
he
had
just
composed
it
himself
so
he
was
very
taken
up
with
it
and
would
not
pay
proper
attention
to
mole
or
anything
else
since
early
morning
he
had
been
swimming
in
the
river
in
company
with
his
friends
the
ducks
and
when
the
ducks
stood
on
their
heads
suddenly
as
ducks
will
he
would
dive
down
and
tickle
their
necks
just
under
where
their
chins
would
be
if
ducks
had
chins
till
they
were
forced
to
come
to
the
surface
again
in
a
hurry
spluttering
and
angry
and
shaking
their
feathers
at
him
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
quite
all
you
feel
when
your
head
is
under
water
at
last
they
implored
him
to
go
away
and
attend
to
his
own
affairs
and
leave
them
to
mind
theirs
so
the
rat
went
away
and
sat
on
the
river
bank
in
the
sun
and
made
up
a
song
about
them
which
he
called
ducks
all
along
the
backwater
through
the
rushes
tall
ducks
are
up
tails
all
ducks
tails
drakes
tails
yellow
feet
yellow
bills
all
out
of
sight
busy
in
the
river
slushy
green
undergrowth
where
the
roach
swim
here
we
keep
our
larder
cool
and
full
and
dim
everyone
for
what
he
likes
like
to
be
heads
down
tails
up
dabbling
free
high
in
the
blue
above
swifts
whirl
and
call
are
down
uptails
all
i
don
t
know
that
i
think
so
very
much
of
that
little
song
rat
observed
the
mole
cautiously
he
was
no
poet
himself
and
didn
t
care
who
knew
it
and
he
had
a
candid
nature
nor
don
t
the
ducks
neither
replied
the
rat
cheerfully
they
say
why
can
t
fellows
be
allowed
to
do
what
they
like
when
they
like
and
as
they
like
instead
of
other
fellows
sitting
on
banks
and
watching
them
all
the
time
and
making
remarks
and
poetry
and
things
about
them
what
nonsense
it
all
is
that
s
what
the
ducks
so
it
is
so
it
is
said
the
mole
with
great
heartiness
no
it
isn
t
cried
the
rat
indignantly
well
then
it
isn
t
it
isn
t
replied
the
mole
soothingly
but
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was
won
t
you
take
me
to
call
on
toad
i
ve
heard
so
much
about
him
and
i
do
so
want
to
make
his
why
certainly
said
the
rat
jumping
to
his
feet
and
dismissing
poetry
from
his
mind
for
the
day
get
the
boat
out
and
we
ll
paddle
up
there
at
once
it
s
never
the
wrong
time
to
call
on
toad
early
or
late
he
s
always
the
same
fellow
always
always
glad
to
see
you
always
sorry
when
you
go
he
must
be
a
very
nice
animal
observed
the
mole
as
he
got
into
the
boat
and
took
the
sculls
while
the
rat
settled
himself
comfortably
in
the
stern
he
is
indeed
the
best
of
animals
replied
rat
so
simple
so
and
so
affectionate
perhaps
he
s
not
very
clever
we
can
t
all
be
geniuses
and
it
may
be
that
he
is
both
boastful
and
conceited
but
he
has
got
some
great
qualities
has
rounding
a
bend
in
the
river
they
came
in
sight
of
a
handsome
dignified
old
house
of
mellowed
red
brick
with
lawns
reaching
down
to
the
water
s
edge
there
s
toad
hall
said
the
rat
and
that
creek
on
the
left
where
the
says
private
no
landing
allowed
leads
to
his
where
we
ll
leave
the
boat
the
stables
are
over
there
to
the
right
that
s
the
you
re
looking
at
now
very
old
that
is
toad
is
rather
rich
you
know
and
this
is
really
one
of
the
nicest
houses
in
these
parts
though
we
never
admit
as
much
to
they
glided
up
the
creek
and
the
mole
shipped
his
sculls
as
they
passed
into
the
shadow
of
a
large
here
they
saw
many
handsome
boats
slung
from
the
cross
beams
or
hauled
up
on
a
slip
but
none
in
the
water
and
the
place
had
an
unused
and
a
deserted
air
the
rat
looked
around
him
i
understand
said
he
boating
is
played
out
he
s
tired
of
it
and
done
with
it
i
wonder
what
new
fad
he
has
taken
up
now
come
along
and
let
s
look
him
up
we
shall
hear
all
about
it
quite
soon
they
disembarked
and
strolled
across
the
gay
lawns
in
search
of
toad
whom
they
presently
happened
upon
resting
in
a
wicker
with
a
expression
of
face
and
a
large
map
spread
out
on
his
knees
hooray
he
cried
jumping
up
on
seeing
them
this
is
splendid
he
shook
the
paws
of
both
of
them
warmly
never
waiting
for
an
introduction
to
the
mole
how
kind
of
you
he
went
on
dancing
round
them
i
was
just
going
to
send
a
boat
down
the
river
for
you
ratty
with
strict
orders
that
you
were
to
be
fetched
up
here
at
once
whatever
you
were
doing
i
want
you
badly
both
of
you
now
what
will
you
take
come
inside
and
have
something
you
don
t
know
how
lucky
it
is
your
turning
up
just
now
let
s
sit
quiet
a
bit
toady
said
the
rat
throwing
himself
into
an
easy
chair
while
the
mole
took
another
by
the
side
of
him
and
made
some
civil
remark
about
toad
s
delightful
finest
house
on
the
whole
river
cried
toad
boisterously
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
he
could
not
help
adding
here
the
rat
nudged
the
mole
unfortunately
the
toad
saw
him
do
it
and
turned
very
red
there
was
a
moment
s
painful
silence
then
toad
burst
out
laughing
all
right
ratty
he
said
it
s
only
my
way
you
know
and
it
s
not
such
a
very
bad
house
is
it
you
know
you
rather
like
it
yourself
now
look
here
let
s
be
sensible
you
are
the
very
animals
i
wanted
you
ve
got
to
help
me
it
s
most
important
it
s
about
your
rowing
i
suppose
said
the
rat
with
an
innocent
air
you
re
getting
on
fairly
well
though
you
splash
a
good
bit
still
with
a
great
deal
of
patience
and
any
quantity
of
coaching
you
may
o
pooh
boating
interrupted
the
toad
in
great
disgust
silly
boyish
amusement
i
ve
given
that
up
long
ago
sheer
waste
of
time
that
s
what
it
is
it
makes
me
downright
sorry
to
see
you
fellows
who
ought
to
know
better
spending
all
your
energies
in
that
aimless
manner
no
i
ve
discovered
the
real
thing
the
only
genuine
occupation
for
a
life
time
i
propose
to
devote
the
remainder
of
mine
to
it
and
can
only
regret
the
wasted
years
that
lie
behind
me
squandered
in
trivialities
come
with
me
dear
ratty
and
your
amiable
friend
also
if
he
will
be
so
very
good
just
as
far
as
the
and
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
he
led
the
way
to
the
accordingly
the
rat
following
with
a
most
mistrustful
expression
and
there
drawn
out
of
the
coach
house
into
the
open
they
saw
a
gipsy
caravan
shining
with
newness
painted
a
picked
out
with
green
and
red
wheels
there
you
are
cried
the
toad
straddling
and
expanding
himself
there
s
real
life
for
you
embodied
in
that
little
cart
the
open
road
the
dusty
highway
the
heath
the
common
the
hedgerows
the
rolling
downs
camps
villages
towns
cities
here
up
and
off
to
somewhere
else
travel
change
interest
excitement
the
whole
world
before
you
and
a
horizon
that
s
always
changing
and
mind
this
is
the
very
finest
cart
of
its
sort
that
was
ever
built
without
any
exception
come
inside
and
look
at
the
arrangements
planned
em
all
myself
i
did
the
mole
was
tremendously
interested
and
excited
and
followed
him
eagerly
up
the
steps
and
into
the
interior
of
the
caravan
the
rat
only
snorted
and
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
remaining
where
he
was
it
was
indeed
very
compact
and
comfortable
little
sleeping
bunks
a
little
table
that
folded
up
against
the
wall
a
lockers
bookshelves
a
with
a
bird
in
it
and
pots
pans
jugs
and
kettles
of
every
size
and
variety
all
complete
said
the
toad
triumphantly
pulling
open
a
locker
you
see
biscuits
potted
lobster
sardines
everything
you
can
possibly
want
here
baccy
there
bacon
jam
cards
and
dominoes
you
ll
find
he
continued
as
they
descended
the
steps
again
you
ll
find
that
nothing
what
ever
has
been
forgotten
when
we
make
our
start
this
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
rat
slowly
as
he
chewed
a
straw
but
did
i
overhear
you
say
something
about
we
and
start
and
this
afternoon
now
you
dear
good
old
ratty
said
toad
imploringly
don
t
begin
talking
in
that
stiff
and
sniffy
sort
of
way
because
you
know
you
ve
got
to
come
i
can
t
possibly
manage
without
you
so
please
consider
it
settled
and
don
t
argue
it
s
the
one
thing
i
can
t
stand
you
surely
don
t
mean
to
stick
to
your
dull
fusty
old
river
all
your
life
and
just
live
in
a
hole
in
a
bank
and
boat
i
want
to
show
you
the
world
i
m
going
to
make
an
animal
of
you
my
boy
i
don
t
care
said
the
rat
doggedly
i
m
not
coming
and
that
s
flat
and
i
am
going
to
stick
to
my
old
river
and
live
in
a
hole
and
boat
as
i
ve
always
done
and
what
s
more
mole
s
going
to
stick
to
me
and
do
as
i
do
aren
t
you
mole
of
course
i
am
said
the
mole
loyally
i
ll
always
stick
to
you
rat
and
what
you
say
is
to
be
has
got
to
be
all
the
same
it
sounds
as
if
it
might
have
been
well
rather
fun
you
know
he
added
wistfully
poor
mole
the
life
adventurous
was
so
new
a
thing
to
him
and
so
thrilling
and
this
fresh
aspect
of
it
was
so
tempting
and
he
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
with
the
cart
and
all
its
little
fitments
the
rat
saw
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
and
wavered
he
hated
disappointing
people
and
he
was
fond
of
the
mole
and
would
do
almost
anything
to
oblige
him
toad
was
watching
both
of
them
closely
come
along
in
and
have
some
lunch
he
said
diplomatically
and
we
ll
talk
it
over
we
needn
t
decide
anything
in
a
hurry
of
course
don
t
really
care
i
only
want
to
give
pleasure
to
you
fellows
live
for
others
that
s
my
motto
in
during
luncheon
which
was
excellent
of
course
as
everything
at
toad
hall
always
was
the
toad
simply
let
himself
go
disregarding
the
rat
he
proceeded
to
play
upon
the
inexperienced
mole
as
on
a
harp
naturally
a
voluble
animal
and
always
mastered
by
his
imagination
he
painted
the
prospects
of
the
trip
and
the
joys
of
the
open
life
and
the
roadside
in
such
glowing
colours
that
the
mole
could
hardly
sit
in
his
chair
for
excitement
somehow
it
soon
seemed
taken
for
granted
by
all
three
of
them
that
the
trip
was
a
settled
thing
and
the
rat
though
still
unconvinced
in
his
mind
allowed
his
to
his
personal
objections
he
could
not
bear
to
disappoint
his
two
friends
who
were
already
deep
in
schemes
and
anticipations
planning
out
each
day
s
separate
occupation
for
several
weeks
ahead
when
they
were
quite
ready
the
now
triumphant
toad
led
his
companions
to
the
paddock
and
set
them
to
capture
the
old
grey
horse
who
without
having
been
consulted
and
to
his
own
extreme
annoyance
had
been
told
off
by
toad
for
the
dustiest
job
in
this
dusty
expedition
he
frankly
preferred
the
paddock
and
took
a
deal
of
catching
meantime
toad
packed
the
lockers
still
tighter
with
necessaries
and
hung
nosebags
nets
of
onions
bundles
of
hay
and
baskets
from
the
bottom
of
the
cart
at
last
the
horse
was
caught
and
harnessed
and
they
set
off
all
talking
at
once
each
animal
either
trudging
by
the
side
of
the
cart
or
sitting
on
the
shaft
as
the
humour
took
him
it
was
a
golden
afternoon
the
smell
of
the
dust
they
kicked
up
was
rich
and
satisfying
out
of
thick
orchards
on
either
side
the
road
birds
called
and
whistled
to
them
cheerily
wayfarers
passing
them
gave
them
or
stopped
to
say
nice
things
about
their
beautiful
cart
and
rabbits
sitting
at
their
front
doors
in
the
hedgerows
held
up
their
and
said
o
my
o
my
o
my
late
in
the
evening
tired
and
happy
and
miles
from
home
they
drew
up
on
a
remote
common
far
from
habitations
turned
the
horse
loose
to
graze
and
ate
their
simple
supper
sitting
on
the
grass
by
the
side
of
the
cart
toad
talked
big
about
all
he
was
going
to
do
in
the
days
to
come
while
stars
grew
fuller
and
larger
all
around
them
and
a
yellow
moon
appearing
suddenly
and
silently
from
nowhere
in
particular
came
to
keep
them
company
and
listen
to
their
talk
at
last
they
turned
in
to
their
little
bunks
in
the
cart
and
toad
kicking
out
his
legs
sleepily
said
well
good
night
you
fellows
this
is
the
real
life
for
a
gentleman
talk
about
your
old
river
i
don
t
talk
about
my
river
replied
the
patient
rat
you
know
i
don
t
toad
but
i
think
about
it
he
added
pathetically
in
a
lower
tone
i
think
about
it
all
the
time
the
mole
reached
out
from
under
his
blanket
felt
for
the
rat
s
paw
in
the
darkness
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
i
ll
do
whatever
you
like
ratty
he
whispered
shall
we
run
away
morning
quite
early
very
early
and
go
back
to
our
dear
old
hole
on
the
river
no
no
we
ll
see
it
out
whispered
back
the
rat
thanks
awfully
but
i
ought
to
stick
by
toad
till
this
trip
is
ended
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
for
him
to
be
left
to
himself
it
won
t
take
very
long
his
fads
never
do
good
night
the
end
was
indeed
nearer
than
even
the
rat
suspected
after
so
much
open
air
and
excitement
the
toad
slept
very
soundly
and
no
amount
of
shaking
could
rouse
him
out
of
bed
next
morning
so
the
mole
and
rat
turned
to
quietly
and
manfully
and
while
the
rat
saw
to
the
horse
and
lit
a
fire
and
cleaned
last
night
s
cups
and
platters
and
got
things
ready
for
breakfast
the
mole
trudged
off
to
the
nearest
village
a
long
way
off
for
milk
and
eggs
and
various
necessaries
the
toad
had
of
course
forgotten
to
provide
the
hard
work
had
all
been
done
and
the
two
animals
were
resting
thoroughly
exhausted
by
the
time
toad
appeared
on
the
scene
fresh
and
gay
remarking
what
a
pleasant
easy
life
it
was
they
were
all
leading
now
after
the
cares
and
worries
and
fatigues
of
housekeeping
at
home
they
had
a
pleasant
ramble
that
day
over
grassy
downs
and
along
narrow
and
camped
as
before
on
a
common
only
this
time
the
two
guests
took
care
that
toad
should
do
his
fair
share
of
work
in
consequence
when
the
time
came
for
starting
next
morning
toad
was
by
no
means
so
rapturous
about
the
simplicity
of
the
primitive
life
and
indeed
attempted
to
resume
his
place
in
his
bunk
whence
he
was
hauled
by
force
their
way
lay
as
before
across
country
by
narrow
lanes
and
it
was
not
till
the
afternoon
that
they
came
out
on
the
their
first
and
there
disaster
fleet
and
unforeseen
sprang
out
on
them
disaster
momentous
indeed
to
their
expedition
but
simply
overwhelming
in
its
effect
on
the
of
toad
they
were
strolling
along
the
easily
the
mole
by
the
horse
s
head
talking
to
him
since
the
horse
had
complained
that
he
was
being
frightfully
left
out
of
it
and
nobody
considered
him
in
the
least
the
toad
and
the
water
rat
walking
behind
the
cart
talking
together
at
least
toad
was
talking
and
rat
was
saying
at
intervals
yes
precisely
and
what
did
you
say
to
him
and
thinking
all
the
time
of
something
very
different
when
far
behind
them
they
heard
a
faint
warning
hum
like
the
drone
of
a
distant
bee
glancing
back
they
saw
a
small
cloud
of
dust
with
a
dark
centre
of
energy
advancing
on
them
at
incredible
speed
while
from
out
the
dust
a
faint
wailed
like
an
uneasy
animal
in
pain
hardly
regarding
it
they
turned
to
resume
their
conversation
when
in
an
instant
as
it
seemed
the
peaceful
scene
was
changed
and
with
a
blast
of
wind
and
a
whirl
of
sound
that
made
them
jump
for
the
nearest
ditch
it
was
on
them
the
rang
with
a
brazen
shout
in
their
ears
they
had
a
moment
s
glimpse
of
an
interior
of
glittering
and
rich
morocco
and
the
magnificent
immense
passionate
with
its
pilot
tense
and
hugging
his
wheel
possessed
all
earth
and
air
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
flung
an
enveloping
cloud
of
dust
that
blinded
and
enwrapped
them
utterly
and
then
dwindled
to
a
speck
in
the
far
distance
changed
back
into
a
droning
bee
once
more
the
old
grey
horse
dreaming
as
he
plodded
along
of
his
quiet
paddock
in
a
new
raw
situation
such
as
this
simply
abandoned
himself
to
his
natural
emotions
rearing
plunging
backing
steadily
in
spite
of
all
the
mole
s
efforts
at
his
head
and
all
the
mole
s
lively
language
directed
at
his
better
feelings
he
drove
the
cart
backwards
towards
the
deep
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
it
wavered
an
instant
then
there
was
a
heartrending
crash
and
the
cart
their
pride
and
their
joy
lay
on
its
side
in
the
ditch
an
irredeemable
wreck
the
rat
danced
up
and
down
in
the
road
simply
transported
with
passion
you
villains
he
shouted
shaking
both
fists
you
scoundrels
you
highwaymen
you
you
roadhogs
i
ll
have
the
law
of
you
i
ll
report
you
i
ll
take
you
through
all
the
courts
his
had
quite
slipped
away
from
him
and
for
the
moment
he
was
the
skipper
of
the
vessel
driven
on
a
shoal
by
the
reckless
jockeying
of
rival
mariners
and
he
was
trying
to
recollect
all
the
fine
and
biting
things
he
used
to
say
to
masters
of
when
their
wash
as
they
drove
too
near
the
bank
used
to
flood
his
at
home
toad
sat
straight
down
in
the
middle
of
the
dusty
road
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
and
stared
fixedly
in
the
direction
of
the
disappearing
he
breathed
short
his
face
wore
a
placid
satisfied
expression
and
at
intervals
he
faintly
murmured
the
mole
was
busy
trying
to
quiet
the
horse
which
he
succeeded
in
doing
after
a
time
then
he
went
to
look
at
the
cart
on
its
side
in
the
ditch
it
was
indeed
a
sorry
sight
panels
and
windows
smashed
axles
hopelessly
bent
one
wheel
off
scattered
over
the
wide
world
and
the
bird
in
the
sobbing
pitifully
and
calling
to
be
let
out
the
rat
came
to
help
him
but
their
united
efforts
were
not
sufficient
to
right
the
cart
hi
toad
they
cried
come
and
bear
a
hand
can
t
you
the
toad
never
answered
a
word
or
budged
from
his
seat
in
the
road
so
they
went
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
him
they
found
him
in
a
sort
of
a
trance
a
happy
smile
on
his
face
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
dusty
wake
of
their
destroyer
at
intervals
he
was
still
heard
to
murmur
the
rat
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
are
you
coming
to
help
us
toad
he
demanded
sternly
glorious
stirring
sight
murmured
toad
never
offering
to
move
the
poetry
of
motion
the
real
way
to
travel
the
only
way
to
travel
here
in
next
week
villages
skipped
towns
and
cities
jumped
always
somebody
else
s
horizon
o
bliss
o
o
my
o
my
o
stop
being
an
ass
toad
cried
the
mole
despairingly
and
to
think
i
never
knew
went
on
the
toad
in
a
dreamy
monotone
all
those
wasted
years
that
lie
behind
me
i
never
knew
never
even
dreamt
but
now
but
now
that
i
know
now
that
i
fully
realise
o
what
a
flowery
track
lies
spread
before
me
henceforth
what
shall
spring
up
behind
me
as
i
speed
on
my
reckless
way
what
carts
i
shall
fling
carelessly
into
the
ditch
in
the
wake
of
my
magnificent
onset
horrid
little
carts
common
carts
carts
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
asked
the
mole
of
the
water
rat
nothing
at
all
replied
the
rat
firmly
because
there
is
really
nothing
to
be
done
you
see
i
know
him
from
of
old
he
is
now
possessed
he
has
got
a
new
craze
and
it
always
takes
him
that
way
in
its
first
stage
he
ll
continue
like
that
for
days
now
like
an
animal
walking
in
a
happy
dream
quite
useless
for
all
practical
purposes
never
mind
him
let
s
go
and
see
what
there
is
to
be
done
about
the
a
careful
inspection
showed
them
that
even
if
they
succeeded
in
righting
it
by
themselves
the
cart
would
travel
no
longer
the
axles
were
in
a
hopeless
state
and
the
missing
wheel
was
shattered
into
pieces
the
rat
knotted
the
horse
s
reins
over
his
back
and
took
him
by
the
head
carrying
the
bird
cage
and
its
hysterical
occupant
in
the
other
hand
come
on
he
said
grimly
to
the
mole
it
s
five
or
six
miles
to
the
nearest
town
and
we
shall
just
have
to
walk
it
the
sooner
we
make
a
start
the
but
what
about
toad
asked
the
mole
anxiously
as
they
set
off
together
we
can
t
leave
him
here
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
road
by
himself
in
the
distracted
state
he
s
in
it
s
not
safe
supposing
another
thing
were
to
come
along
o
bother
toad
said
the
rat
savagely
i
ve
done
with
him
they
had
not
proceeded
very
far
on
their
way
however
when
there
was
a
pattering
of
feet
behind
them
and
toad
caught
them
up
and
thrust
a
paw
inside
the
elbow
of
each
of
them
still
breathing
short
and
staring
into
vacancy
now
look
here
toad
said
the
rat
sharply
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
town
you
ll
have
to
go
straight
to
the
and
see
if
they
know
anything
about
that
and
who
it
belongs
to
and
lodge
a
complaint
against
it
and
then
you
ll
have
to
go
to
a
blacksmith
s
or
a
wheelwright
s
and
arrange
for
the
cart
to
be
fetched
and
mended
and
put
to
rights
it
ll
take
time
but
it
s
not
quite
a
hopeless
smash
meanwhile
the
mole
and
i
will
go
to
an
inn
and
find
comfortable
rooms
where
we
can
stay
till
the
cart
s
ready
and
till
your
nerves
have
recovered
their
complaint
murmured
toad
dreamily
me
complain
of
that
beautiful
that
heavenly
vision
that
has
been
vouchsafed
me
mend
the
cart
i
ve
done
with
carts
for
ever
i
never
want
to
see
the
cart
or
to
hear
of
it
again
o
ratty
you
can
t
think
how
obliged
i
am
to
you
for
consenting
to
come
on
this
trip
i
wouldn
t
have
gone
without
you
and
then
i
might
never
have
seen
that
that
swan
that
sunbeam
that
thunderbolt
i
might
never
have
heard
that
entrancing
sound
or
smelt
that
bewitching
smell
i
owe
it
all
to
you
my
best
of
friends
the
rat
turned
from
him
in
despair
you
see
what
it
is
he
said
to
the
mole
addressing
him
across
toad
s
head
he
s
quite
hopeless
i
give
it
up
when
we
get
to
the
town
we
ll
go
to
the
railway
station
and
with
luck
we
may
pick
up
a
train
there
that
ll
get
us
back
to
riverbank
and
if
ever
you
catch
me
going
with
this
provoking
animal
again
he
snorted
and
during
the
rest
of
that
weary
trudge
addressed
his
remarks
exclusively
to
mole
on
reaching
the
town
they
went
straight
to
the
station
and
deposited
toad
in
the
giving
a
porter
twopence
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
him
they
then
left
the
horse
at
an
inn
stable
and
gave
what
directions
they
could
about
the
cart
and
its
contents
eventually
a
slow
train
having
landed
them
at
a
station
not
very
far
from
toad
hall
they
escorted
the
toad
to
his
door
put
him
inside
it
and
instructed
his
housekeeper
to
feed
him
undress
him
and
put
him
to
bed
then
they
got
out
their
boat
from
the
sculled
down
the
river
home
and
at
a
very
late
hour
sat
down
to
supper
in
their
own
cosy
riverside
parlour
to
the
rat
s
great
joy
and
contentment
the
following
evening
the
mole
who
had
risen
late
and
taken
things
very
easy
all
day
was
sitting
on
the
bank
fishing
when
the
rat
who
had
been
looking
up
his
friends
and
gossiping
came
strolling
along
to
find
him
heard
the
news
he
said
there
s
nothing
else
being
talked
about
all
along
the
river
bank
toad
went
up
to
town
by
an
early
train
this
morning
and
he
has
ordered
a
large
and
very
expensive
iii
the
wild
wood
the
mole
had
long
wanted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
badger
he
seemed
by
all
accounts
to
be
such
an
important
personage
and
though
rarely
visible
to
make
his
unseen
influence
felt
by
everybody
about
the
place
but
whenever
the
mole
mentioned
his
wish
to
the
water
rat
he
always
found
himself
put
off
it
s
all
right
the
rat
would
say
badger
ll
turn
up
some
day
or
other
he
s
always
turning
up
and
then
i
ll
introduce
you
the
best
of
fellows
but
you
must
not
only
take
him
as
you
find
him
but
when
you
find
couldn
t
you
ask
him
here
dinner
or
something
said
the
mole
he
wouldn
t
come
replied
the
rat
simply
badger
hates
society
and
invitations
and
dinner
and
all
that
sort
of
well
then
supposing
we
go
and
call
on
him
suggested
the
mole
o
i
m
sure
he
wouldn
t
like
that
at
all
said
the
rat
quite
alarmed
he
s
so
very
shy
he
d
be
sure
to
be
offended
i
ve
never
even
ventured
to
call
on
him
at
his
own
home
myself
though
i
know
him
so
well
besides
we
can
t
it
s
quite
out
of
the
question
because
he
lives
in
the
very
middle
of
the
wild
well
supposing
he
does
said
the
mole
you
told
me
the
wild
wood
was
all
right
you
o
i
know
i
know
so
it
is
replied
the
rat
evasively
but
i
think
we
won
t
go
there
just
now
not
just
yet
it
s
a
long
way
and
he
wouldn
t
be
at
home
at
this
time
of
year
anyhow
and
he
ll
be
coming
along
some
day
if
you
ll
wait
the
mole
had
to
be
content
with
this
but
the
badger
never
came
along
and
every
day
brought
its
amusements
and
it
was
not
till
summer
was
long
over
and
cold
and
frost
and
miry
ways
kept
them
much
indoors
and
the
swollen
river
raced
past
outside
their
windows
with
a
speed
that
mocked
at
boating
of
any
sort
or
kind
that
he
found
his
thoughts
dwelling
again
with
much
persistence
on
the
solitary
grey
badger
who
lived
his
own
life
by
himself
in
his
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
wild
wood
in
the
winter
time
the
rat
slept
a
great
deal
retiring
early
and
rising
late
during
his
short
day
he
sometimes
scribbled
poetry
or
did
other
small
domestic
jobs
about
the
house
and
of
course
there
were
always
animals
dropping
in
for
a
chat
and
consequently
there
was
a
good
deal
of
and
comparing
notes
on
the
past
summer
and
all
its
doings
such
a
rich
chapter
it
had
been
when
one
came
to
look
back
on
it
all
with
illustrations
so
numerous
and
so
very
highly
coloured
the
pageant
of
the
river
bank
had
marched
steadily
along
unfolding
itself
in
that
succeeded
each
other
in
stately
procession
purple
loosestrife
arrived
early
shaking
luxuriant
tangled
locks
along
the
edge
of
the
mirror
whence
its
own
face
laughed
back
at
it
tender
and
wistful
like
a
pink
sunset
cloud
was
not
slow
to
follow
comfrey
the
purple
with
the
white
crept
forth
to
take
its
place
in
the
line
and
at
last
one
morning
the
diffident
and
delaying
stepped
delicately
on
the
stage
and
one
knew
as
if
had
announced
it
in
stately
chords
that
strayed
into
a
gavotte
that
june
at
last
was
here
one
member
of
the
company
was
still
awaited
the
for
the
nymphs
to
woo
the
knight
for
whom
the
ladies
waited
at
the
window
the
prince
that
was
to
kiss
the
sleeping
summer
back
to
life
and
love
but
when
debonair
and
odorous
in
amber
jerkin
moved
graciously
to
his
place
in
the
group
then
the
play
was
ready
to
begin
and
what
a
play
it
had
been
drowsy
animals
snug
in
their
holes
while
wind
and
rain
were
battering
at
their
doors
recalled
still
keen
mornings
an
hour
before
sunrise
when
the
white
mist
as
yet
undispersed
clung
closely
along
the
surface
of
the
water
then
the
shock
of
the
early
plunge
the
scamper
along
the
bank
and
the
radiant
transformation
of
earth
air
and
water
when
suddenly
the
sun
was
with
them
again
and
grey
was
gold
and
colour
was
born
and
sprang
out
of
the
earth
once
more
they
recalled
the
languorous
siesta
of
hot
deep
in
green
undergrowth
the
sun
striking
through
in
tiny
golden
shafts
and
spots
the
boating
and
bathing
of
the
afternoon
the
rambles
along
dusty
lanes
and
through
yellow
cornfields
and
the
long
cool
evening
at
last
when
so
many
threads
were
gathered
up
so
many
friendships
rounded
and
so
many
adventures
planned
for
the
morrow
there
was
plenty
to
talk
about
on
those
short
winter
days
when
the
animals
found
themselves
round
the
fire
still
the
mole
had
a
good
deal
of
spare
time
on
his
hands
and
so
one
afternoon
when
the
rat
in
his
before
the
blaze
was
alternately
dozing
and
trying
over
rhymes
that
wouldn
t
fit
he
formed
the
resolution
to
go
out
by
himself
and
explore
the
wild
wood
and
perhaps
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
badger
it
was
a
cold
still
afternoon
with
a
hard
steely
sky
overhead
when
he
slipped
out
of
the
warm
parlour
into
the
open
air
the
country
lay
bare
and
entirely
leafless
around
him
and
he
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
so
far
and
so
intimately
into
the
insides
of
things
as
on
that
winter
day
when
nature
was
deep
in
her
annual
slumber
and
seemed
to
have
kicked
the
clothes
off
copses
dells
quarries
and
all
hidden
places
which
had
been
mysterious
mines
for
exploration
in
leafy
summer
now
exposed
themselves
and
their
secrets
pathetically
and
seemed
to
ask
him
to
overlook
their
shabby
poverty
for
a
while
till
they
could
riot
in
rich
masquerade
as
before
and
trick
and
entice
him
with
the
old
deceptions
it
was
pitiful
in
a
way
and
yet
cheering
even
exhilarating
he
was
glad
that
he
liked
the
country
undecorated
hard
and
stripped
of
its
finery
he
had
got
down
to
the
bare
bones
of
it
and
they
were
fine
and
strong
and
simple
he
did
not
want
the
warm
clover
and
the
play
of
seeding
grasses
the
screens
of
quickset
the
billowy
drapery
of
beech
and
elm
seemed
best
away
and
with
great
cheerfulness
of
spirit
he
pushed
on
towards
the
wild
wood
which
lay
before
him
low
and
threatening
like
a
black
reef
in
some
still
southern
sea
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
him
at
first
entry
twigs
crackled
under
his
feet
logs
tripped
him
funguses
on
stumps
resembled
caricatures
and
startled
him
for
the
moment
by
their
likeness
to
something
familiar
and
far
away
but
that
was
all
fun
and
exciting
it
led
him
on
and
he
penetrated
to
where
the
light
was
less
and
trees
crouched
nearer
and
nearer
and
holes
made
ugly
mouths
at
him
on
either
side
everything
was
very
still
now
the
dusk
advanced
on
him
steadily
rapidly
gathering
in
behind
and
before
and
the
light
seemed
to
be
draining
away
like
then
the
faces
began
it
was
over
his
shoulder
and
indistinctly
that
he
first
thought
he
saw
a
face
a
little
evil
face
looking
out
at
him
from
a
hole
when
he
turned
and
confronted
it
the
thing
had
vanished
he
quickened
his
pace
telling
himself
cheerfully
not
to
begin
imagining
things
or
there
would
be
simply
no
end
to
it
he
passed
another
hole
and
another
and
another
and
then
yes
no
yes
certainly
a
little
narrow
face
with
hard
eyes
had
flashed
up
for
an
instant
from
a
hole
and
was
gone
he
hesitated
braced
himself
up
for
an
effort
and
strode
on
then
suddenly
and
as
if
it
had
been
so
all
the
time
every
hole
far
and
near
and
there
were
hundreds
of
them
seemed
to
possess
its
face
coming
and
going
rapidly
all
fixing
on
him
glances
of
malice
and
hatred
all
and
evil
and
sharp
if
he
could
only
get
away
from
the
holes
in
the
banks
he
thought
there
would
be
no
more
faces
he
swung
off
the
path
and
plunged
into
the
untrodden
places
of
the
wood
then
the
whistling
began
very
faint
and
shrill
it
was
and
far
behind
him
when
first
he
heard
it
but
somehow
it
made
him
hurry
forward
then
still
very
faint
and
shrill
it
sounded
far
ahead
of
him
and
made
him
hesitate
and
want
to
go
back
as
he
halted
in
indecision
it
broke
out
on
either
side
and
seemed
to
be
caught
up
and
passed
on
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
wood
to
its
farthest
limit
they
were
up
and
alert
and
ready
evidently
whoever
they
were
and
he
he
was
alone
and
unarmed
and
far
from
any
help
and
the
night
was
closing
in
then
the
pattering
began
he
thought
it
was
only
falling
leaves
at
first
so
slight
and
delicate
was
the
sound
of
it
then
as
it
grew
it
took
a
regular
rhythm
and
he
knew
it
for
nothing
else
but
the
of
little
feet
still
a
very
long
way
off
was
it
in
front
or
behind
it
seemed
to
be
first
one
and
then
the
other
then
both
it
grew
and
it
multiplied
till
from
every
quarter
as
he
listened
anxiously
leaning
this
way
and
that
it
seemed
to
be
closing
in
on
him
as
he
stood
still
to
hearken
a
rabbit
came
running
hard
towards
him
through
the
trees
he
waited
expecting
it
to
slacken
pace
or
to
swerve
from
him
into
a
different
course
instead
the
animal
almost
brushed
him
as
it
dashed
past
his
face
set
and
hard
his
eyes
staring
get
out
of
this
you
fool
get
out
the
mole
heard
him
mutter
as
he
swung
round
a
stump
and
disappeared
down
a
friendly
burrow
the
pattering
increased
till
it
sounded
like
sudden
hail
on
the
dry
spread
around
him
the
whole
wood
seemed
running
now
running
hard
hunting
chasing
closing
in
round
something
or
somebody
in
panic
he
began
to
run
too
aimlessly
he
knew
not
whither
he
ran
up
against
things
he
fell
over
things
and
into
things
he
darted
under
things
and
dodged
round
things
at
last
he
took
refuge
in
the
deep
dark
hollow
of
an
old
beech
tree
which
offered
shelter
concealment
perhaps
even
safety
but
who
could
tell
anyhow
he
was
too
tired
to
run
any
further
and
could
only
snuggle
down
into
the
dry
leaves
which
had
drifted
into
the
hollow
and
hope
he
was
safe
for
a
time
and
as
he
lay
there
panting
and
trembling
and
listened
to
the
whistlings
and
the
patterings
outside
he
knew
it
at
last
in
all
its
fullness
that
dread
thing
which
other
little
dwellers
in
field
and
hedgerow
had
encountered
here
and
known
as
their
darkest
moment
that
thing
which
the
rat
had
vainly
tried
to
shield
him
from
the
terror
of
the
wild
wood
meantime
the
rat
warm
and
comfortable
dozed
by
his
fireside
his
paper
of
verses
slipped
from
his
knee
his
head
fell
back
his
mouth
opened
and
he
wandered
by
the
verdant
banks
of
then
a
coal
slipped
the
fire
crackled
and
sent
up
a
spurt
of
flame
and
he
woke
with
a
start
remembering
what
he
had
been
engaged
upon
he
reached
down
to
the
floor
for
his
verses
pored
over
them
for
a
minute
and
then
looked
round
for
the
mole
to
ask
him
if
he
knew
a
good
rhyme
for
something
or
other
but
the
mole
was
not
there
he
listened
for
a
time
the
house
seemed
very
quiet
then
he
called
moly
several
times
and
receiving
no
answer
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
hall
the
mole
s
cap
was
missing
from
its
accustomed
peg
his
goloshes
which
always
lay
by
the
were
also
gone
the
rat
left
the
house
and
carefully
examined
the
muddy
surface
of
the
ground
outside
hoping
to
find
the
mole
s
tracks
there
they
were
sure
enough
the
goloshes
were
new
just
bought
for
the
winter
and
the
pimples
on
their
soles
were
fresh
and
sharp
he
could
see
the
imprints
of
them
in
the
mud
running
along
straight
and
purposeful
leading
direct
to
the
wild
wood
the
rat
looked
very
grave
and
stood
in
deep
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
then
he
the
house
strapped
a
belt
round
his
waist
shoved
a
brace
of
pistols
into
it
took
up
a
stout
cudgel
that
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
and
set
off
for
the
wild
wood
at
a
smart
pace
it
was
already
getting
towards
dusk
when
he
reached
the
first
fringe
of
trees
and
plunged
without
hesitation
into
the
wood
looking
anxiously
on
either
side
for
any
sign
of
his
friend
here
and
there
wicked
little
faces
popped
out
of
holes
but
vanished
immediately
at
sight
of
the
valorous
animal
his
pistols
and
the
great
ugly
cudgel
in
his
grasp
and
the
whistling
and
pattering
which
he
had
heard
quite
plainly
on
his
first
entry
died
away
and
ceased
and
all
was
very
still
he
made
his
way
manfully
through
the
length
of
the
wood
to
its
furthest
edge
then
forsaking
all
paths
he
set
himself
to
traverse
it
laboriously
working
over
the
whole
ground
and
all
the
time
calling
out
cheerfully
moly
moly
moly
where
are
you
it
s
me
it
s
old
rat
he
had
patiently
hunted
through
the
wood
for
an
hour
or
more
when
at
last
to
his
joy
he
heard
a
little
answering
cry
guiding
himself
by
the
sound
he
made
his
way
through
the
gathering
darkness
to
the
foot
of
an
old
beech
tree
with
a
hole
in
it
and
from
out
of
the
hole
came
a
feeble
voice
saying
ratty
is
that
really
you
the
rat
crept
into
the
hollow
and
there
he
found
the
mole
exhausted
and
still
trembling
o
rat
he
cried
i
ve
been
so
frightened
you
can
t
think
o
i
quite
understand
said
the
rat
soothingly
you
shouldn
t
really
have
gone
and
done
it
mole
i
did
my
best
to
keep
you
from
it
we
we
hardly
ever
come
here
by
ourselves
if
we
have
to
come
we
come
in
couples
at
least
then
we
re
generally
all
right
besides
there
are
a
hundred
things
one
has
to
know
which
we
understand
all
about
and
you
don
t
as
yet
i
mean
passwords
and
signs
and
sayings
which
have
power
and
effect
and
plants
you
carry
in
your
pocket
and
verses
you
repeat
and
dodges
and
tricks
you
practise
all
simple
enough
when
you
know
them
but
they
ve
got
to
be
known
if
you
re
small
or
you
ll
find
yourself
in
trouble
of
course
if
you
were
badger
or
otter
it
would
be
quite
another
surely
the
brave
toad
wouldn
t
mind
coming
here
by
himself
would
he
inquired
the
mole
old
toad
said
the
rat
laughing
heartily
he
wouldn
t
show
his
face
here
alone
not
for
a
whole
hatful
of
golden
guineas
toad
wouldn
the
mole
was
greatly
cheered
by
the
sound
of
the
rat
s
careless
laughter
as
well
as
by
the
sight
of
his
stick
and
his
gleaming
pistols
and
he
stopped
shivering
and
began
to
feel
bolder
and
more
himself
again
now
then
said
the
rat
presently
we
really
must
pull
ourselves
together
and
make
a
start
for
home
while
there
s
still
a
little
light
left
it
will
never
do
to
spend
the
night
here
you
understand
too
cold
for
one
dear
ratty
said
the
poor
mole
i
m
dreadfully
sorry
but
i
m
simply
dead
beat
and
that
s
a
solid
fact
you
must
let
me
rest
here
a
while
longer
and
get
my
strength
back
if
i
m
to
get
home
at
o
all
right
said
the
rat
rest
away
it
s
pretty
nearly
pitch
dark
now
anyhow
and
there
ought
to
be
a
bit
of
a
moon
so
the
mole
got
well
into
the
dry
leaves
and
stretched
himself
out
and
presently
dropped
off
into
sleep
though
of
a
broken
and
troubled
sort
while
the
rat
covered
himself
up
too
as
best
he
might
for
warmth
and
lay
patiently
waiting
with
a
pistol
in
his
paw
when
at
last
the
mole
woke
up
much
refreshed
and
in
his
usual
spirits
the
rat
said
now
then
i
ll
just
take
a
look
outside
and
see
if
everything
s
quiet
and
then
we
really
must
be
he
went
to
the
entrance
of
their
retreat
and
put
his
head
out
then
the
mole
heard
him
saying
quietly
to
himself
hullo
hullo
here
is
a
go
what
s
up
ratty
asked
the
mole
snow
is
up
replied
the
rat
briefly
or
rather
down
it
s
snowing
the
mole
came
and
crouched
beside
him
and
looking
out
saw
the
wood
that
had
been
so
dreadful
to
him
in
quite
a
changed
aspect
holes
hollows
pools
pitfalls
and
other
black
menaces
to
the
wayfarer
were
vanishing
fast
and
a
gleaming
carpet
of
faery
was
springing
up
everywhere
that
looked
too
delicate
to
be
trodden
upon
by
rough
feet
a
fine
powder
filled
the
air
and
caressed
the
cheek
with
a
tingle
in
its
touch
and
the
black
boles
of
the
trees
showed
up
in
a
light
that
seemed
to
come
from
below
well
well
it
can
t
be
helped
said
the
rat
after
pondering
we
must
make
a
start
and
take
our
chance
i
suppose
the
worst
of
it
is
i
don
t
exactly
know
where
we
are
and
now
this
snow
makes
everything
look
so
very
it
did
indeed
the
mole
would
not
have
known
that
it
was
the
same
wood
however
they
set
out
bravely
and
took
the
line
that
seemed
most
promising
holding
on
to
each
other
and
pretending
with
invincible
cheerfulness
that
they
recognized
an
old
friend
in
every
fresh
tree
that
grimly
and
silently
greeted
them
or
saw
openings
gaps
or
paths
with
a
familiar
turn
in
them
in
the
monotony
of
white
space
and
black
that
refused
to
vary
an
hour
or
two
later
they
had
lost
all
count
of
time
they
pulled
up
dispirited
weary
and
hopelessly
at
sea
and
sat
down
on
a
fallen
to
recover
their
breath
and
consider
what
was
to
be
done
they
were
aching
with
fatigue
and
bruised
with
tumbles
they
had
fallen
into
several
holes
and
got
wet
through
the
snow
was
getting
so
deep
that
they
could
hardly
drag
their
little
legs
through
it
and
the
trees
were
thicker
and
more
like
each
other
than
ever
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
this
wood
and
no
beginning
and
no
difference
in
it
and
worst
of
all
no
way
out
we
can
t
sit
here
very
long
said
the
rat
we
shall
have
to
make
another
push
for
it
and
do
something
or
other
the
cold
is
too
awful
for
anything
and
the
snow
will
soon
be
too
deep
for
us
to
wade
he
peered
about
him
and
considered
look
here
he
went
on
this
is
what
occurs
to
me
there
s
a
sort
of
dell
down
here
in
front
of
us
where
the
ground
seems
all
hilly
and
humpy
and
hummocky
we
ll
make
our
way
down
into
that
and
try
and
find
some
sort
of
shelter
a
cave
or
hole
with
a
dry
floor
to
it
out
of
the
snow
and
the
wind
and
there
we
ll
have
a
good
rest
before
we
try
again
for
we
re
both
of
us
pretty
dead
beat
besides
the
snow
may
leave
off
or
something
may
turn
so
once
more
they
got
on
their
feet
and
struggled
down
into
the
dell
where
they
hunted
about
for
a
cave
or
some
corner
that
was
dry
and
a
protection
from
the
keen
wind
and
the
whirling
snow
they
were
investigating
one
of
the
hummocky
bits
the
rat
had
spoken
of
when
suddenly
the
mole
tripped
up
and
fell
forward
on
his
face
with
a
squeal
o
my
leg
he
cried
o
my
poor
shin
and
he
sat
up
on
the
snow
and
nursed
his
leg
in
both
his
front
paws
poor
old
mole
said
the
rat
kindly
you
don
t
seem
to
be
having
much
luck
do
you
let
s
have
a
look
at
the
leg
yes
he
went
on
going
down
on
his
knees
to
look
you
ve
cut
your
shin
sure
enough
wait
till
i
get
at
my
handkerchief
and
i
ll
tie
it
up
for
i
must
have
tripped
over
a
hidden
branch
or
a
stump
said
the
mole
miserably
o
my
o
my
it
s
a
very
clean
cut
said
the
rat
examining
it
again
attentively
that
was
never
done
by
a
branch
or
a
stump
looks
as
if
it
was
made
by
a
sharp
edge
of
something
in
metal
funny
he
pondered
awhile
and
examined
the
humps
and
slopes
that
surrounded
them
well
never
mind
what
done
it
said
the
mole
forgetting
his
grammar
in
his
pain
it
hurts
just
the
same
whatever
done
but
the
rat
after
carefully
tying
up
the
leg
with
his
handkerchief
had
left
him
and
was
busy
scraping
in
the
snow
he
scratched
and
shovelled
and
explored
all
four
legs
working
busily
while
the
mole
waited
impatiently
remarking
at
intervals
o
come
on
rat
suddenly
the
rat
cried
hooray
and
then
and
fell
to
executing
a
feeble
jig
in
the
snow
what
have
you
found
ratty
asked
the
mole
still
nursing
his
leg
come
and
see
said
the
delighted
rat
as
he
jigged
on
the
mole
hobbled
up
to
the
spot
and
had
a
good
look
well
he
said
at
last
slowly
i
see
it
right
enough
seen
the
same
sort
of
thing
before
lots
of
times
familiar
object
i
call
it
a
well
what
of
it
why
dance
jigs
around
a
but
don
t
you
see
what
it
means
you
you
animal
cried
the
rat
impatiently
of
course
i
see
what
it
means
replied
the
mole
it
simply
means
that
some
very
careless
and
forgetful
person
has
left
his
lying
about
in
the
middle
of
the
wild
wood
just
where
it
s
sure
to
trip
everybody
up
very
thoughtless
of
him
i
call
it
when
i
get
home
i
shall
go
and
complain
about
it
to
to
somebody
or
other
see
if
i
don
t
o
dear
o
dear
cried
the
rat
in
despair
at
his
obtuseness
here
stop
arguing
and
come
and
scrape
and
he
set
to
work
again
and
made
the
snow
fly
in
all
directions
around
him
after
some
further
toil
his
efforts
were
rewarded
and
a
very
shabby
lay
exposed
to
view
there
what
did
i
tell
you
exclaimed
the
rat
in
great
triumph
absolutely
nothing
whatever
replied
the
mole
with
perfect
truthfulness
well
now
he
went
on
you
seem
to
have
found
another
piece
of
domestic
litter
done
for
and
thrown
away
and
i
suppose
you
re
perfectly
happy
better
go
ahead
and
dance
your
jig
round
that
if
you
ve
got
to
and
get
it
over
and
then
perhaps
we
can
go
on
and
not
waste
any
more
time
over
can
we
eat
a
doormat
or
sleep
under
a
or
sit
on
a
and
sledge
home
over
the
snow
on
it
you
exasperating
rodent
do
you
mean
to
say
cried
the
excited
rat
that
this
doesn
t
tell
you
anything
really
rat
said
the
mole
quite
pettishly
i
think
we
d
had
enough
of
this
folly
who
ever
heard
of
a
telling
anyone
anything
they
simply
don
t
do
it
they
are
not
that
sort
at
all
know
their
now
look
here
you
you
beast
replied
the
rat
really
angry
this
must
stop
not
another
word
but
scrape
scrape
and
scratch
and
dig
and
hunt
round
especially
on
the
sides
of
the
hummocks
if
you
want
to
sleep
dry
and
warm
for
it
s
our
last
chance
the
rat
attacked
a
beside
them
with
ardour
probing
with
his
cudgel
everywhere
and
then
digging
with
fury
and
the
mole
scraped
busily
too
more
to
oblige
the
rat
than
for
any
other
reason
for
his
opinion
was
that
his
friend
was
getting
some
ten
minutes
hard
work
and
the
point
of
the
rat
s
cudgel
struck
something
that
sounded
hollow
he
worked
till
he
could
get
a
paw
through
and
feel
then
called
the
mole
to
come
and
help
him
hard
at
it
went
the
two
animals
till
at
last
the
result
of
their
labours
stood
full
in
view
of
the
astonished
and
hitherto
incredulous
mole
in
the
side
of
what
had
seemed
to
be
a
stood
a
little
door
painted
a
dark
green
an
iron
hung
by
the
side
and
below
it
on
a
small
brass
plate
neatly
engraved
in
square
capital
letters
they
could
read
by
the
aid
of
moonlight
badger
the
mole
fell
backwards
on
the
snow
from
sheer
surprise
and
delight
rat
he
cried
in
penitence
you
re
a
wonder
a
real
wonder
that
s
what
you
are
i
see
it
all
now
you
argued
it
out
step
by
step
in
that
wise
head
of
yours
from
the
very
moment
that
i
fell
and
cut
my
shin
and
you
looked
at
the
cut
and
at
once
your
majestic
mind
said
to
itself
and
then
you
turned
to
and
found
the
very
that
done
it
did
you
stop
there
no
some
people
would
have
been
quite
satisfied
but
not
you
your
intellect
went
on
working
let
me
only
just
find
a
says
you
to
yourself
and
my
theory
is
proved
and
of
course
you
found
your
you
re
so
clever
i
believe
you
could
find
anything
you
liked
now
says
you
that
door
exists
as
plain
as
if
i
saw
it
there
s
nothing
else
remains
to
be
done
but
to
find
it
well
i
ve
read
about
that
sort
of
thing
in
books
but
i
ve
never
come
across
it
before
in
real
life
you
ought
to
go
where
you
ll
be
properly
appreciated
you
re
simply
wasted
here
among
us
fellows
if
i
only
had
your
head
ratty
but
as
you
haven
t
interrupted
the
rat
rather
unkindly
i
suppose
you
re
going
to
sit
on
the
snow
all
night
and
talk
get
up
at
once
and
hang
on
to
that
you
see
there
and
ring
hard
as
hard
as
you
can
while
i
hammer
while
the
rat
attacked
the
door
with
his
stick
the
mole
sprang
up
at
the
clutched
it
and
swung
there
both
feet
well
off
the
ground
and
from
quite
a
long
way
off
they
could
faintly
hear
a
bell
respond
iv
badger
they
waited
patiently
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
stamping
in
the
snow
to
keep
their
feet
warm
at
last
they
heard
the
sound
of
slow
shuffling
footsteps
approaching
the
door
from
the
inside
it
seemed
as
the
mole
remarked
to
the
rat
like
some
one
walking
in
carpet
slippers
that
were
too
large
for
him
and
down
at
heel
which
was
intelligent
of
mole
because
that
was
exactly
what
it
was
there
was
the
noise
of
a
bolt
shot
back
and
the
door
opened
a
few
inches
enough
to
show
a
long
snout
and
a
pair
of
sleepy
blinking
eyes
now
the
very
next
time
this
happens
said
a
gruff
and
suspicious
voice
i
shall
be
exceedingly
angry
who
is
it
this
time
disturbing
people
on
such
a
night
speak
up
oh
badger
cried
the
rat
let
us
in
please
it
s
me
rat
and
my
friend
mole
and
we
ve
lost
our
way
in
the
what
ratty
my
dear
little
man
exclaimed
the
badger
in
quite
a
different
voice
come
along
in
both
of
you
at
once
why
you
must
be
perished
well
i
never
lost
in
the
snow
and
in
the
wild
wood
too
and
at
this
time
of
night
but
come
in
with
the
two
animals
tumbled
over
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
get
inside
and
heard
the
door
shut
behind
them
with
great
joy
and
relief
the
badger
who
wore
a
long
and
whose
slippers
were
indeed
very
down
at
heel
carried
a
flat
candlestick
in
his
paw
and
had
probably
been
on
his
way
to
bed
when
their
summons
sounded
he
looked
kindly
down
on
them
and
patted
both
their
heads
this
is
not
the
sort
of
night
for
small
animals
to
be
out
he
said
paternally
i
m
afraid
you
ve
been
up
to
some
of
your
pranks
again
ratty
but
come
along
come
into
the
kitchen
there
s
a
fire
there
and
supper
and
he
shuffled
on
in
front
of
them
carrying
the
light
and
they
followed
him
nudging
each
other
in
an
anticipating
sort
of
way
down
a
long
gloomy
and
to
tell
the
truth
decidedly
shabby
passage
into
a
sort
of
a
central
hall
out
of
which
they
could
dimly
see
other
long
passages
branching
passages
mysterious
and
without
apparent
end
but
there
were
doors
in
the
hall
as
well
stout
oaken
doors
one
of
these
the
badger
flung
open
and
at
once
they
found
themselves
in
all
the
glow
and
warmth
of
a
large
kitchen
the
floor
was
red
brick
and
on
the
wide
hearth
burnt
a
fire
of
logs
between
two
attractive
tucked
away
in
the
wall
well
out
of
any
suspicion
of
draught
a
couple
of
settles
facing
each
other
on
either
side
of
the
fire
gave
further
sitting
accommodations
for
the
sociably
disposed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
long
table
of
plain
boards
placed
on
trestles
with
benches
down
each
side
at
one
end
of
it
where
an
stood
pushed
back
were
spread
the
remains
of
the
badger
s
plain
but
ample
supper
rows
of
spotless
plates
winked
from
the
shelves
of
the
dresser
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
from
the
rafters
overhead
hung
hams
bundles
of
dried
herbs
nets
of
onions
and
baskets
of
eggs
it
seemed
a
place
where
heroes
could
fitly
feast
after
victory
where
weary
harvesters
could
line
up
in
scores
along
the
table
and
keep
their
harvest
home
with
mirth
and
song
or
where
two
or
three
friends
of
simple
tastes
could
sit
about
as
they
pleased
and
eat
and
smoke
and
talk
in
comfort
and
contentment
the
ruddy
brick
floor
smiled
up
at
the
smoky
ceiling
the
oaken
settles
shiny
with
long
wear
exchanged
cheerful
glances
with
each
other
plates
on
the
dresser
grinned
at
pots
on
the
shelf
and
the
merry
firelight
flickered
and
played
over
everything
without
distinction
the
kindly
badger
thrust
them
down
on
a
settle
to
toast
themselves
at
the
fire
and
bade
them
remove
their
wet
coats
and
boots
then
he
fetched
them
and
slippers
and
himself
bathed
the
mole
s
shin
with
warm
water
and
mended
the
cut
with
till
the
whole
thing
was
just
as
good
as
new
if
not
better
in
the
embracing
light
and
warmth
warm
and
dry
at
last
with
weary
legs
propped
up
in
front
of
them
and
a
suggestive
clink
of
plates
being
arranged
on
the
table
behind
it
seemed
to
the
animals
now
in
safe
anchorage
that
the
cold
and
trackless
wild
wood
just
left
outside
was
miles
and
miles
away
and
all
that
they
had
suffered
in
it
a
dream
when
at
last
they
were
thoroughly
toasted
the
badger
summoned
them
to
the
table
where
he
had
been
busy
laying
a
repast
they
had
felt
pretty
hungry
before
but
when
they
actually
saw
at
last
the
supper
that
was
spread
for
them
really
it
seemed
only
a
question
of
what
they
should
attack
first
where
all
was
so
attractive
and
whether
the
other
things
would
obligingly
wait
for
them
till
they
had
time
to
give
them
attention
conversation
was
impossible
for
a
long
time
and
when
it
was
slowly
resumed
it
was
that
regrettable
sort
of
conversation
that
results
from
talking
with
your
mouth
full
the
badger
did
not
mind
that
sort
of
thing
at
all
nor
did
he
take
any
notice
of
elbows
on
the
table
or
everybody
speaking
at
once
as
he
did
not
go
into
society
himself
he
had
got
an
idea
that
these
things
belonged
to
the
things
that
didn
t
really
matter
we
know
of
course
that
he
was
wrong
and
took
too
narrow
a
view
because
they
do
matter
very
much
though
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
why
he
sat
in
his
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
nodded
gravely
at
intervals
as
the
animals
told
their
story
and
he
did
not
seem
surprised
or
shocked
at
anything
and
he
never
said
i
told
you
so
or
just
what
i
always
said
or
remarked
that
they
ought
to
have
done
or
ought
not
to
have
done
something
else
the
mole
began
to
feel
very
friendly
towards
him
when
supper
was
really
finished
at
last
and
each
animal
felt
that
his
skin
was
now
as
tight
as
was
decently
safe
and
that
by
this
time
he
didn
t
care
a
hang
for
anybody
or
anything
they
gathered
round
the
glowing
embers
of
the
great
wood
fire
and
thought
how
jolly
it
was
to
be
sitting
up
so
late
and
so
independent
and
so
full
and
after
they
had
chatted
for
a
time
about
things
in
general
the
badger
said
heartily
now
then
tell
us
the
news
from
your
part
of
the
world
how
s
old
toad
going
on
oh
from
bad
to
worse
said
the
rat
gravely
while
the
mole
cocked
up
on
a
settle
and
basking
in
the
firelight
his
heels
higher
than
his
head
tried
to
look
properly
mournful
another
only
last
week
and
a
bad
one
you
see
he
will
insist
on
driving
himself
and
he
s
hopelessly
incapable
if
he
d
only
employ
a
decent
steady
animal
pay
him
good
wages
and
leave
everything
to
him
he
d
get
on
all
right
but
no
he
s
convinced
he
s
a
driver
and
nobody
can
teach
him
anything
and
all
the
rest
how
many
has
he
had
inquired
the
badger
gloomily
smashes
or
machines
asked
the
rat
oh
well
after
all
it
s
the
same
thing
with
toad
this
is
the
seventh
as
for
the
others
you
know
that
of
his
well
it
s
piled
up
literally
piled
up
to
the
roof
with
fragments
of
none
of
them
bigger
than
your
hat
that
accounts
for
the
other
six
so
far
as
they
can
be
accounted
he
s
been
in
hospital
three
times
put
in
the
mole
and
as
for
the
fines
he
s
had
to
pay
it
s
simply
awful
to
think
yes
and
that
s
part
of
the
trouble
continued
the
rat
toad
s
rich
we
all
know
but
he
s
not
a
millionaire
and
he
s
a
hopelessly
bad
driver
and
quite
regardless
of
law
and
order
killed
or
ruined
it
s
got
to
be
one
of
the
two
things
sooner
or
later
badger
we
re
his
friends
oughtn
t
we
to
do
something
the
badger
went
through
a
bit
of
hard
thinking
now
look
here
he
said
at
last
rather
severely
of
course
you
know
i
can
t
do
anything
now
his
two
friends
assented
quite
understanding
his
point
no
animal
according
to
the
rules
of
is
ever
expected
to
do
anything
strenuous
or
heroic
or
even
moderately
active
during
the
of
winter
all
are
sleepy
some
actually
asleep
all
are
more
or
less
and
all
are
resting
from
arduous
days
and
nights
during
which
every
muscle
in
them
has
been
severely
tested
and
every
energy
kept
at
full
stretch
very
well
then
continued
the
badger
but
when
once
the
year
has
really
turned
and
the
nights
are
shorter
and
halfway
through
them
one
rouses
and
feels
fidgety
and
wanting
to
be
up
and
doing
by
sunrise
if
not
before
you
know
both
animals
nodded
gravely
they
knew
well
then
went
on
the
badger
we
that
is
you
and
me
and
our
friend
the
mole
here
we
ll
take
toad
seriously
in
hand
we
ll
stand
no
nonsense
whatever
we
ll
bring
him
back
to
reason
by
force
if
need
be
we
ll
make
him
be
a
sensible
toad
we
ll
you
re
asleep
rat
not
me
said
the
rat
waking
up
with
a
jerk
he
s
been
asleep
two
or
three
times
since
supper
said
the
mole
laughing
he
himself
was
feeling
quite
wakeful
and
even
lively
though
he
didn
t
know
why
the
reason
was
of
course
that
he
being
naturally
an
underground
animal
by
birth
and
breeding
the
situation
of
badger
s
house
exactly
suited
him
and
made
him
feel
at
home
while
the
rat
who
slept
every
night
in
a
bedroom
the
windows
of
which
opened
on
a
breezy
river
naturally
felt
the
atmosphere
still
and
oppressive
well
it
s
time
we
were
all
in
bed
said
the
badger
getting
up
and
fetching
flat
candlesticks
come
along
you
two
and
i
ll
show
you
your
quarters
and
take
your
time
tomorrow
morning
breakfast
at
any
hour
you
please
he
conducted
the
two
animals
to
a
long
room
that
seemed
half
bedchamber
and
half
loft
the
badger
s
winter
stores
which
indeed
were
visible
everywhere
took
up
half
the
room
piles
of
apples
turnips
and
potatoes
baskets
full
of
nuts
and
jars
of
honey
but
the
two
little
white
beds
on
the
remainder
of
the
floor
looked
soft
and
inviting
and
the
linen
on
them
though
coarse
was
clean
and
smelt
beautifully
of
lavender
and
the
mole
and
the
water
rat
shaking
off
their
garments
in
some
thirty
seconds
tumbled
in
between
the
sheets
in
great
joy
and
contentment
in
accordance
with
the
kindly
badger
s
injunctions
the
two
tired
animals
came
down
to
breakfast
very
late
next
morning
and
found
a
bright
fire
burning
in
the
kitchen
and
two
young
hedgehogs
sitting
on
a
bench
at
the
table
eating
oatmeal
porridge
out
of
wooden
bowls
the
hedgehogs
dropped
their
spoons
rose
to
their
feet
and
ducked
their
heads
respectfully
as
the
two
entered
there
sit
down
sit
down
said
the
rat
pleasantly
and
go
on
with
your
porridge
where
have
you
youngsters
come
from
lost
your
way
in
the
snow
i
suppose
yes
please
sir
said
the
elder
of
the
two
hedgehogs
respectfully
me
and
little
billy
here
we
was
trying
to
find
our
way
to
school
mother
would
have
us
go
was
the
weather
ever
so
and
of
course
we
lost
ourselves
sir
and
billy
he
got
frightened
and
took
and
cried
being
young
and
and
at
last
we
happened
up
against
badger
s
back
door
and
made
so
bold
as
to
knock
sir
for
badger
he
s
a
gentleman
as
everyone
knows
i
understand
said
the
rat
cutting
himself
some
rashers
from
a
side
of
bacon
while
the
mole
dropped
some
eggs
into
a
saucepan
and
what
s
the
weather
like
outside
you
needn
t
sir
me
quite
so
much
he
added
o
terrible
bad
sir
terrible
deep
the
snow
is
said
the
hedgehog
no
getting
out
for
the
likes
of
you
gentlemen
where
s
badger
inquired
the
mole
as
he
warmed
the
before
the
fire
the
master
s
gone
into
his
study
sir
replied
the
hedgehog
and
he
said
as
how
he
was
going
to
be
particular
busy
this
morning
and
on
no
account
was
he
to
be
this
explanation
of
course
was
thoroughly
understood
by
every
one
present
the
fact
is
as
already
set
forth
when
you
live
a
life
of
intense
activity
for
six
months
in
the
year
and
of
comparative
or
actual
somnolence
for
the
other
six
during
the
latter
period
you
can
not
be
continually
pleading
sleepiness
when
there
are
people
about
or
things
to
be
done
the
excuse
gets
monotonous
the
animals
well
knew
that
badger
having
eaten
a
hearty
breakfast
had
retired
to
his
study
and
settled
himself
in
an
with
his
legs
up
on
another
and
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
over
his
face
and
was
being
busy
in
the
usual
way
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
bell
clanged
loudly
and
the
rat
who
was
very
greasy
with
buttered
toast
sent
billy
the
smaller
hedgehog
to
see
who
it
might
be
there
was
a
sound
of
much
stamping
in
the
hall
and
presently
billy
returned
in
front
of
the
otter
who
threw
himself
on
the
rat
with
an
embrace
and
a
shout
of
affectionate
greeting
get
off
spluttered
the
rat
with
his
mouth
full
thought
i
should
find
you
here
all
right
said
the
otter
cheerfully
they
were
all
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
along
river
bank
when
i
arrived
this
morning
rat
never
been
home
all
night
nor
mole
either
something
dreadful
must
have
happened
they
said
and
the
snow
had
covered
up
all
your
tracks
of
course
but
i
knew
that
when
people
were
in
any
fix
they
mostly
went
to
badger
or
else
badger
got
to
know
of
it
somehow
so
i
came
straight
off
here
through
the
wild
wood
and
the
snow
my
it
was
fine
coming
through
the
snow
as
the
red
sun
was
rising
and
showing
against
the
black
as
you
went
along
in
the
stillness
every
now
and
then
masses
of
snow
slid
off
the
branches
suddenly
with
a
flop
making
you
jump
and
run
for
cover
and
had
sprung
up
out
of
nowhere
in
the
night
and
snow
bridges
terraces
ramparts
i
could
have
stayed
and
played
with
them
for
hours
here
and
there
great
branches
had
been
torn
away
by
the
sheer
weight
of
the
snow
and
robins
perched
and
hopped
on
them
in
their
perky
conceited
way
just
as
if
they
had
done
it
themselves
a
ragged
string
of
wild
geese
passed
overhead
high
on
the
grey
sky
and
a
few
rooks
whirled
over
the
trees
inspected
and
flapped
off
homewards
with
a
disgusted
expression
but
i
met
no
sensible
being
to
ask
the
news
of
about
halfway
across
i
came
on
a
rabbit
sitting
on
a
stump
cleaning
his
silly
face
with
his
paws
he
was
a
pretty
scared
animal
when
i
crept
up
behind
him
and
placed
a
heavy
forepaw
on
his
shoulder
i
had
to
cuff
his
head
once
or
twice
to
get
any
sense
out
of
it
at
all
at
last
i
managed
to
extract
from
him
that
mole
had
been
seen
in
the
wild
wood
last
night
by
one
of
them
it
was
the
talk
of
the
burrows
he
said
how
mole
rat
s
particular
friend
was
in
a
bad
fix
how
he
had
lost
his
way
and
they
were
up
and
out
hunting
and
were
chivvying
him
round
and
round
then
why
didn
t
any
of
you
do
something
i
asked
you
mayn
t
be
blest
with
brains
but
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
you
big
stout
fellows
as
fat
as
butter
and
your
burrows
running
in
all
directions
and
you
could
have
taken
him
in
and
made
him
safe
and
comfortable
or
tried
to
at
all
what
us
he
merely
said
do
something
us
rabbits
so
i
cuffed
him
again
and
left
him
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
at
any
rate
i
had
learnt
something
and
if
i
had
had
the
luck
to
meet
any
of
them
i
d
have
learnt
something
more
or
they
weren
t
you
at
all
er
nervous
asked
the
mole
some
of
yesterday
s
terror
coming
back
to
him
at
the
mention
of
the
wild
wood
nervous
the
otter
showed
a
gleaming
set
of
strong
white
teeth
as
he
laughed
i
d
give
em
nerves
if
any
of
them
tried
anything
on
with
me
here
mole
fry
me
some
slices
of
ham
like
the
good
little
chap
you
are
i
m
frightfully
hungry
and
i
ve
got
any
amount
to
say
to
ratty
here
haven
t
seen
him
for
an
so
the
mole
having
cut
some
slices
of
ham
set
the
hedgehogs
to
fry
it
and
returned
to
his
own
breakfast
while
the
otter
and
the
rat
their
heads
together
eagerly
talked
which
is
long
shop
and
talk
that
is
endless
running
on
like
the
babbling
river
itself
a
plate
of
fried
ham
had
just
been
cleared
and
sent
back
for
more
when
the
badger
entered
yawning
and
rubbing
his
eyes
and
greeted
them
all
in
his
quiet
simple
way
with
kind
enquiries
for
every
one
it
must
be
getting
on
for
luncheon
time
he
remarked
to
the
otter
better
stop
and
have
it
with
us
you
must
be
hungry
this
cold
rather
replied
the
otter
winking
at
the
mole
the
sight
of
these
greedy
young
hedgehogs
stuffing
themselves
with
fried
ham
makes
me
feel
positively
the
hedgehogs
who
were
just
beginning
to
feel
hungry
again
after
their
porridge
and
after
working
so
hard
at
their
frying
looked
timidly
up
at
badger
but
were
too
shy
to
say
anything
here
you
two
youngsters
be
off
home
to
your
mother
said
the
badger
kindly
i
ll
send
some
one
with
you
to
show
you
the
way
you
won
t
want
any
dinner
i
ll
be
he
gave
them
sixpence
apiece
and
a
pat
on
the
head
and
they
went
off
with
much
respectful
swinging
of
caps
and
touching
of
forelocks
presently
they
all
sat
down
to
luncheon
together
the
mole
found
himself
placed
next
to
badger
and
as
the
other
two
were
still
deep
in
from
which
nothing
could
divert
them
he
took
the
opportunity
to
tell
badger
how
comfortable
and
it
all
felt
to
him
once
well
underground
he
said
you
know
exactly
where
you
are
nothing
can
happen
to
you
and
nothing
can
get
at
you
you
re
entirely
your
own
master
and
you
don
t
have
to
consult
anybody
or
mind
what
they
say
things
go
on
all
the
same
overhead
and
you
let
em
and
don
t
bother
about
em
when
you
want
to
up
you
go
and
there
the
things
are
waiting
for
the
badger
simply
beamed
on
him
that
s
exactly
what
i
say
he
replied
there
s
no
security
or
peace
and
tranquillity
except
underground
and
then
if
your
ideas
get
larger
and
you
want
to
expand
why
a
dig
and
a
scrape
and
there
you
are
if
you
feel
your
house
is
a
bit
too
big
you
stop
up
a
hole
or
two
and
there
you
are
again
no
builders
no
tradesmen
no
remarks
passed
on
you
by
fellows
looking
over
your
wall
and
above
all
no
weather
look
at
rat
now
a
couple
of
feet
of
flood
water
and
he
s
got
to
move
into
hired
lodgings
uncomfortable
inconveniently
situated
and
horribly
expensive
take
toad
i
say
nothing
against
toad
hall
quite
the
best
house
in
these
parts
as
a
house
but
supposing
a
fire
breaks
out
where
s
toad
supposing
tiles
are
blown
off
or
walls
sink
or
crack
or
windows
get
broken
where
s
toad
supposing
the
rooms
are
draughty
i
hate
a
draught
myself
where
s
toad
no
up
and
out
of
doors
is
good
enough
to
roam
about
and
get
one
s
living
in
but
underground
to
come
back
to
at
last
that
s
my
idea
of
the
mole
assented
heartily
and
the
badger
in
consequence
got
very
friendly
with
him
when
lunch
is
over
he
said
i
ll
take
you
all
round
this
little
place
of
mine
i
can
see
you
ll
appreciate
it
you
understand
what
domestic
architecture
ought
to
be
you
after
luncheon
accordingly
when
the
other
two
had
settled
themselves
into
the
and
had
started
a
heated
argument
on
the
subject
of
eels
the
badger
lighted
a
lantern
and
bade
the
mole
follow
him
crossing
the
hall
they
passed
down
one
of
the
principal
tunnels
and
the
wavering
light
of
the
lantern
gave
glimpses
on
either
side
of
rooms
both
large
and
small
some
mere
cupboards
others
nearly
as
broad
and
imposing
as
toad
s
a
narrow
passage
at
right
angles
led
them
into
another
corridor
and
here
the
same
thing
was
repeated
the
mole
was
staggered
at
the
size
the
extent
the
ramifications
of
it
all
at
the
length
of
the
dim
passages
the
solid
vaultings
of
the
crammed
the
masonry
everywhere
the
pillars
the
arches
the
pavements
how
on
earth
badger
he
said
at
last
did
you
ever
find
time
and
strength
to
do
all
this
it
s
astonishing
it
would
be
astonishing
indeed
said
the
badger
simply
if
i
had
done
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
none
of
it
only
cleaned
out
the
passages
and
chambers
as
far
as
i
had
need
of
them
there
s
lots
more
of
it
all
round
about
i
see
you
don
t
understand
and
i
must
explain
it
to
you
well
very
long
ago
on
the
spot
where
the
wild
wood
waves
now
before
ever
it
had
planted
itself
and
grown
up
to
what
it
now
is
there
was
a
city
a
city
of
people
you
know
here
where
we
are
standing
they
lived
and
walked
and
talked
and
slept
and
carried
on
their
business
here
they
stabled
their
horses
and
feasted
from
here
they
rode
out
to
fight
or
drove
out
to
trade
they
were
a
powerful
people
and
rich
and
great
builders
they
built
to
last
for
they
thought
their
city
would
last
for
but
what
has
become
of
them
all
asked
the
mole
who
can
tell
said
the
badger
people
come
they
stay
for
a
while
they
flourish
they
build
and
they
go
it
is
their
way
but
we
remain
there
were
badgers
here
i
ve
been
told
long
before
that
same
city
ever
came
to
be
and
now
there
are
badgers
here
again
we
are
an
enduring
lot
and
we
may
move
out
for
a
time
but
we
wait
and
are
patient
and
back
we
come
and
so
it
will
ever
well
and
when
they
went
at
last
those
people
said
the
mole
when
they
went
continued
the
badger
the
strong
winds
and
persistent
rains
took
the
matter
in
hand
patiently
ceaselessly
year
after
year
perhaps
we
badgers
too
in
our
small
way
helped
a
little
who
knows
it
was
all
down
down
down
gradually
ruin
and
levelling
and
disappearance
then
it
was
all
up
up
up
gradually
as
seeds
grew
to
saplings
and
saplings
to
forest
trees
and
bramble
and
fern
came
creeping
in
to
help
rose
and
obliterated
streams
in
their
winter
freshets
brought
sand
and
soil
to
clog
and
to
cover
and
in
course
of
time
our
home
was
ready
for
us
again
and
we
moved
in
up
above
us
on
the
surface
the
same
thing
happened
animals
arrived
liked
the
look
of
the
place
took
up
their
quarters
settled
down
spread
and
flourished
they
didn
t
bother
themselves
about
the
past
they
never
do
they
re
too
busy
the
place
was
a
bit
humpy
and
hillocky
naturally
and
full
of
holes
but
that
was
rather
an
advantage
and
they
don
t
bother
about
the
future
either
the
future
when
perhaps
the
people
will
move
in
again
for
a
time
as
may
very
well
be
the
wild
wood
is
pretty
well
populated
by
now
with
all
the
usual
lot
good
bad
and
indifferent
i
name
no
names
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
but
i
fancy
you
know
something
about
them
yourself
by
this
i
do
indeed
said
the
mole
with
a
slight
shiver
well
well
said
the
badger
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
it
was
your
first
experience
of
them
you
see
they
re
not
so
bad
really
and
we
must
all
live
and
let
live
but
i
ll
pass
the
word
around
and
i
think
you
ll
have
no
further
trouble
any
friend
of
mine
walks
where
he
likes
in
this
country
or
i
ll
know
the
reason
why
when
they
got
back
to
the
kitchen
again
they
found
the
rat
walking
up
and
down
very
restless
the
underground
atmosphere
was
oppressing
him
and
getting
on
his
nerves
and
he
seemed
really
to
be
afraid
that
the
river
would
run
away
if
he
wasn
t
there
to
look
after
it
so
he
had
his
overcoat
on
and
his
pistols
thrust
into
his
belt
again
come
along
mole
he
said
anxiously
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
them
we
must
get
off
while
it
s
daylight
don
t
want
to
spend
another
night
in
the
wild
wood
it
ll
be
all
right
my
fine
fellow
said
the
otter
i
m
coming
along
with
you
and
i
know
every
path
blindfold
and
if
there
s
a
head
that
needs
to
be
punched
you
can
confidently
rely
upon
me
to
punch
you
really
needn
t
fret
ratty
added
the
badger
placidly
my
passages
run
further
than
you
think
and
i
ve
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
in
several
directions
though
i
don
t
care
for
everybody
to
know
about
them
when
you
really
have
to
go
you
shall
leave
by
one
of
my
short
cuts
meantime
make
yourself
easy
and
sit
down
the
rat
was
nevertheless
still
anxious
to
be
off
and
attend
to
his
river
so
the
badger
taking
up
his
lantern
again
led
the
way
along
a
damp
and
airless
tunnel
that
wound
and
dipped
part
vaulted
part
hewn
through
solid
rock
for
a
weary
distance
that
seemed
to
be
miles
at
last
daylight
began
to
show
itself
confusedly
through
tangled
growth
overhanging
the
mouth
of
the
passage
and
the
badger
bidding
them
a
hasty
pushed
them
hurriedly
through
the
opening
made
everything
look
as
natural
as
possible
again
with
creepers
brushwood
and
dead
leaves
and
retreated
they
found
themselves
standing
on
the
very
edge
of
the
wild
wood
rocks
and
brambles
and
behind
them
confusedly
heaped
and
tangled
in
front
a
great
space
of
quiet
fields
hemmed
by
lines
of
hedges
black
on
the
snow
and
far
ahead
a
glint
of
the
familiar
old
river
while
the
wintry
sun
hung
red
and
low
on
the
horizon
the
otter
as
knowing
all
the
paths
took
charge
of
the
party
and
they
trailed
out
on
a
for
a
distant
stile
pausing
there
a
moment
and
looking
back
they
saw
the
whole
mass
of
the
wild
wood
dense
menacing
compact
grimly
set
in
vast
white
surroundings
simultaneously
they
turned
and
made
swiftly
for
home
for
firelight
and
the
familiar
things
it
played
on
for
the
voice
sounding
cheerily
outside
their
window
of
the
river
that
they
knew
and
trusted
in
all
its
moods
that
never
made
them
afraid
with
any
amazement
as
he
hurried
along
eagerly
anticipating
the
moment
when
he
would
be
at
home
again
among
the
things
he
knew
and
liked
the
mole
saw
clearly
that
he
was
an
animal
of
tilled
field
and
linked
to
the
ploughed
furrow
the
frequented
pasture
the
lane
of
evening
lingerings
the
cultivated
for
others
the
asperities
the
stubborn
endurance
or
the
clash
of
actual
conflict
that
went
with
nature
in
the
rough
he
must
be
wise
must
keep
to
the
pleasant
places
in
which
his
lines
were
laid
and
which
held
adventure
enough
in
their
way
to
last
for
a
lifetime
dulce
domum
the
sheep
ran
huddling
together
against
the
hurdles
blowing
out
thin
nostrils
and
stamping
with
delicate
their
heads
thrown
back
and
a
light
steam
rising
from
the
crowded
into
the
frosty
air
as
the
two
animals
hastened
by
in
high
spirits
with
much
chatter
and
laughter
they
were
returning
across
country
after
a
long
day
s
outing
with
otter
hunting
and
exploring
on
the
wide
uplands
where
certain
streams
tributary
to
their
own
river
had
their
first
small
beginnings
and
the
shades
of
the
short
winter
day
were
closing
in
on
them
and
they
had
still
some
distance
to
go
plodding
at
random
across
the
plough
they
had
heard
the
sheep
and
had
made
for
them
and
now
leading
from
the
they
found
a
beaten
track
that
made
walking
a
lighter
business
and
responded
moreover
to
that
small
inquiring
something
which
all
animals
carry
inside
them
saying
unmistakably
yes
quite
right
this
leads
home
it
looks
as
if
we
were
coming
to
a
village
said
the
mole
somewhat
dubiously
slackening
his
pace
as
the
track
that
had
in
time
become
a
path
and
then
had
developed
into
a
lane
now
handed
them
over
to
the
charge
of
a
road
the
animals
did
not
hold
with
villages
and
their
own
highways
thickly
frequented
as
they
were
took
an
independent
course
regardless
of
church
post
office
or
oh
never
mind
said
the
rat
at
this
season
of
the
year
they
re
all
safe
indoors
by
this
time
sitting
round
the
fire
men
women
and
children
dogs
and
cats
and
all
we
shall
slip
through
all
right
without
any
bother
or
unpleasantness
and
we
can
have
a
look
at
them
through
their
windows
if
you
like
and
see
what
they
re
the
rapid
nightfall
of
had
quite
beset
the
little
village
as
they
approached
it
on
soft
feet
over
a
first
thin
fall
of
powdery
snow
little
was
visible
but
squares
of
a
dusky
on
either
side
of
the
street
where
the
firelight
or
lamplight
of
each
cottage
overflowed
through
the
casements
into
the
dark
world
without
most
of
the
low
latticed
windows
were
innocent
of
blinds
and
to
the
from
outside
the
inmates
gathered
round
the
absorbed
in
handiwork
or
talking
with
laughter
and
gesture
had
each
that
happy
grace
which
is
the
last
thing
the
skilled
actor
shall
capture
the
natural
grace
which
goes
with
perfect
unconsciousness
of
observation
moving
at
will
from
one
theatre
to
another
the
two
spectators
so
far
from
home
themselves
had
something
of
wistfulness
in
their
eyes
as
they
watched
a
cat
being
stroked
a
sleepy
child
picked
up
and
huddled
off
to
bed
or
a
tired
man
stretch
and
knock
out
his
pipe
on
the
end
of
a
smouldering
log
but
it
was
from
one
little
window
with
its
blind
drawn
down
a
mere
blank
transparency
on
the
night
that
the
sense
of
home
and
the
little
curtained
world
within
walls
the
larger
stressful
world
of
outside
nature
shut
out
and
forgotten
most
pulsated
close
against
the
white
blind
hung
a
clearly
silhouetted
every
wire
perch
and
appurtenance
distinct
and
recognisable
even
to
yesterday
s
lump
of
sugar
on
the
middle
perch
the
fluffy
occupant
head
tucked
well
into
feathers
seemed
so
near
to
them
as
to
be
easily
stroked
had
they
tried
even
the
delicate
tips
of
his
plumage
pencilled
plainly
on
the
illuminated
screen
as
they
looked
the
sleepy
little
fellow
stirred
uneasily
woke
shook
himself
and
raised
his
head
they
could
see
the
gape
of
his
tiny
beak
as
he
yawned
in
a
bored
sort
of
way
looked
round
and
then
settled
his
head
into
his
back
again
while
the
ruffled
feathers
gradually
subsided
into
perfect
stillness
then
a
gust
of
bitter
wind
took
them
in
the
back
of
the
neck
a
small
sting
of
frozen
sleet
on
the
skin
woke
them
as
from
a
dream
and
they
knew
their
toes
to
be
cold
and
their
legs
tired
and
their
own
home
distant
a
weary
way
once
beyond
the
village
where
the
cottages
ceased
abruptly
on
either
side
of
the
road
they
could
smell
through
the
darkness
the
friendly
fields
again
and
they
braced
themselves
for
the
last
long
stretch
the
home
stretch
the
stretch
that
we
know
is
bound
to
end
some
time
in
the
rattle
of
the
the
sudden
firelight
and
the
sight
of
familiar
things
greeting
us
as
travellers
from
far
they
plodded
along
steadily
and
silently
each
of
them
thinking
his
own
thoughts
the
mole
s
ran
a
good
deal
on
supper
as
it
was
and
it
was
all
a
strange
country
for
him
as
far
as
he
knew
and
he
was
following
obediently
in
the
wake
of
the
rat
leaving
the
guidance
entirely
to
him
as
for
the
rat
he
was
walking
a
little
way
ahead
as
his
habit
was
his
shoulders
humped
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
straight
grey
road
in
front
of
him
so
he
did
not
notice
poor
mole
when
suddenly
the
summons
reached
him
and
took
him
like
an
electric
shock
we
others
who
have
long
lost
the
more
subtle
of
the
physical
senses
have
not
even
proper
terms
to
express
an
animal
s
with
his
surroundings
living
or
otherwise
and
have
only
the
word
smell
for
instance
to
include
the
whole
range
of
delicate
thrills
which
murmur
in
the
nose
of
the
animal
night
and
day
summoning
warning
inciting
repelling
it
was
one
of
these
mysterious
fairy
calls
from
out
the
void
that
suddenly
reached
mole
in
the
darkness
making
him
tingle
through
and
through
with
its
very
familiar
appeal
even
while
yet
he
could
not
clearly
remember
what
it
was
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
his
nose
searching
hither
and
thither
in
its
efforts
to
recapture
the
fine
filament
the
telegraphic
current
that
had
so
strongly
moved
him
a
moment
and
he
had
caught
it
again
and
with
it
this
time
came
recollection
in
fullest
flood
home
that
was
what
they
meant
those
caressing
appeals
those
soft
touches
wafted
through
the
air
those
invisible
little
hands
pulling
and
tugging
all
one
way
why
it
must
be
quite
close
by
him
at
that
moment
his
old
home
that
he
had
hurriedly
forsaken
and
never
sought
again
that
day
when
he
first
found
the
river
and
now
it
was
sending
out
its
scouts
and
its
messengers
to
capture
him
and
bring
him
in
since
his
escape
on
that
bright
morning
he
had
hardly
given
it
a
thought
so
absorbed
had
he
been
in
his
new
life
in
all
its
pleasures
its
surprises
its
fresh
and
captivating
experiences
now
with
a
rush
of
old
memories
how
clearly
it
stood
up
before
him
in
the
darkness
shabby
indeed
and
small
and
poorly
furnished
and
yet
his
the
home
he
had
made
for
himself
the
home
he
had
been
so
happy
to
get
back
to
after
his
day
s
work
and
the
home
had
been
happy
with
him
too
evidently
and
was
missing
him
and
wanted
him
back
and
was
telling
him
so
through
his
nose
sorrowfully
reproachfully
but
with
no
bitterness
or
anger
only
with
plaintive
reminder
that
it
was
there
and
wanted
him
the
call
was
clear
the
summons
was
plain
he
must
obey
it
instantly
and
go
ratty
he
called
full
of
joyful
excitement
hold
on
come
back
i
want
you
quick
oh
come
along
mole
do
replied
the
rat
cheerfully
still
plodding
along
please
stop
ratty
pleaded
the
poor
mole
in
anguish
of
heart
you
don
t
understand
it
s
my
home
my
old
home
i
ve
just
come
across
the
smell
of
it
and
it
s
close
by
here
really
quite
close
and
i
must
go
to
it
i
must
i
must
oh
come
back
ratty
please
please
come
back
the
rat
was
by
this
time
very
far
ahead
too
far
to
hear
clearly
what
the
mole
was
calling
too
far
to
catch
the
sharp
note
of
painful
appeal
in
his
voice
and
he
was
much
taken
up
with
the
weather
for
he
too
could
smell
something
something
suspiciously
like
approaching
snow
mole
we
mustn
t
stop
now
really
he
called
back
we
ll
come
for
it
whatever
it
is
you
ve
found
but
i
daren
t
stop
now
it
s
late
and
the
snow
s
coming
on
again
and
i
m
not
sure
of
the
way
and
i
want
your
nose
mole
so
come
on
quick
there
s
a
good
fellow
and
the
rat
pressed
forward
on
his
way
without
waiting
for
an
answer
poor
mole
stood
alone
in
the
road
his
heart
torn
asunder
and
a
big
sob
gathering
gathering
somewhere
low
down
inside
him
to
leap
up
to
the
surface
presently
he
knew
in
passionate
escape
but
even
under
such
a
test
as
this
his
loyalty
to
his
friend
stood
firm
never
for
a
moment
did
he
dream
of
abandoning
him
meanwhile
the
wafts
from
his
old
home
pleaded
whispered
conjured
and
finally
claimed
him
imperiously
he
dared
not
tarry
longer
within
their
magic
circle
with
a
wrench
that
tore
his
very
heartstrings
he
set
his
face
down
the
road
and
followed
submissively
in
the
track
of
the
rat
while
faint
thin
little
smells
still
dogging
his
retreating
nose
reproached
him
for
his
new
friendship
and
his
callous
forgetfulness
with
an
effort
he
caught
up
to
the
unsuspecting
rat
who
began
chattering
cheerfully
about
what
they
would
do
when
they
got
back
and
how
jolly
a
fire
of
logs
in
the
parlour
would
be
and
what
a
supper
he
meant
to
eat
never
noticing
his
companion
s
silence
and
distressful
state
of
mind
at
last
however
when
they
had
gone
some
considerable
way
further
and
were
passing
some
at
the
edge
of
a
copse
that
bordered
the
road
he
stopped
and
said
kindly
look
here
mole
old
chap
you
seem
dead
tired
no
talk
left
in
you
and
your
feet
dragging
like
lead
we
ll
sit
down
here
for
a
minute
and
rest
the
snow
has
held
off
so
far
and
the
best
part
of
our
journey
is
the
mole
subsided
forlornly
on
a
and
tried
to
control
himself
for
he
felt
it
surely
coming
the
sob
he
had
fought
with
so
long
refused
to
be
beaten
up
and
up
it
forced
its
way
to
the
air
and
then
another
and
another
and
others
thick
and
fast
till
poor
mole
at
last
gave
up
the
struggle
and
cried
freely
and
helplessly
and
openly
now
that
he
knew
it
was
all
over
and
he
had
lost
what
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
found
the
rat
astonished
and
dismayed
at
the
violence
of
mole
s
paroxysm
of
grief
did
not
dare
to
speak
for
a
while
at
last
he
said
very
quietly
and
sympathetically
what
is
it
old
fellow
whatever
can
be
the
matter
tell
us
your
trouble
and
let
me
see
what
i
can
poor
mole
found
it
difficult
to
get
any
words
out
between
the
upheavals
of
his
chest
that
followed
one
upon
another
so
quickly
and
held
back
speech
and
choked
it
as
it
came
i
know
it
s
a
shabby
dingy
little
place
he
sobbed
forth
at
last
brokenly
not
like
your
cosy
quarters
or
toad
s
beautiful
hall
or
badger
s
great
house
but
it
was
my
own
little
home
and
i
was
fond
of
it
and
i
went
away
and
forgot
all
about
it
and
then
i
smelt
it
suddenly
on
the
road
when
i
called
and
you
wouldn
t
listen
rat
and
everything
came
back
to
me
with
a
rush
and
i
wanted
it
o
dear
o
dear
and
when
you
wouldn
t
turn
back
ratty
and
i
had
to
leave
it
though
i
was
smelling
it
all
the
time
i
thought
my
heart
would
we
might
have
just
gone
and
had
one
look
at
it
ratty
only
one
look
it
was
close
by
but
you
wouldn
t
turn
back
ratty
you
wouldn
t
turn
back
o
dear
o
dear
recollection
brought
fresh
waves
of
sorrow
and
sobs
again
took
full
charge
of
him
preventing
further
speech
the
rat
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
saying
nothing
only
patting
mole
gently
on
the
shoulder
after
a
time
he
muttered
gloomily
i
see
it
all
now
what
a
pig
i
have
been
a
pig
that
s
me
just
a
pig
a
plain
pig
he
waited
till
mole
s
sobs
became
gradually
less
stormy
and
more
rhythmical
he
waited
till
at
last
sniffs
were
frequent
and
sobs
only
intermittent
then
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
remarking
carelessly
well
now
we
d
really
better
be
getting
on
old
chap
set
off
up
the
road
again
over
the
toilsome
way
they
had
come
wherever
are
you
hic
going
to
hic
ratty
cried
the
tearful
mole
looking
up
in
alarm
we
re
going
to
find
that
home
of
yours
old
fellow
replied
the
rat
pleasantly
so
you
had
better
come
along
for
it
will
take
some
finding
and
we
shall
want
your
oh
come
back
ratty
do
cried
the
mole
getting
up
and
hurrying
after
him
it
s
no
good
i
tell
you
it
s
too
late
and
too
dark
and
the
place
is
too
far
off
and
the
snow
s
coming
and
and
i
never
meant
to
let
you
know
i
was
feeling
that
way
about
it
it
was
all
an
accident
and
a
mistake
and
think
of
river
bank
and
your
supper
hang
river
bank
and
supper
too
said
the
rat
heartily
i
tell
you
i
m
going
to
find
this
place
now
if
i
stay
out
all
night
so
cheer
up
old
chap
and
take
my
arm
and
we
ll
very
soon
be
back
there
still
snuffling
pleading
and
reluctant
mole
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
back
along
the
road
by
his
imperious
companion
who
by
a
flow
of
cheerful
talk
and
anecdote
endeavoured
to
beguile
his
spirits
back
and
make
the
weary
way
seem
shorter
when
at
last
it
seemed
to
the
rat
that
they
must
be
nearing
that
part
of
the
road
where
the
mole
had
been
held
up
he
said
now
no
more
talking
business
use
your
nose
and
give
your
mind
to
they
moved
on
in
silence
for
some
little
way
when
suddenly
the
rat
was
conscious
through
his
arm
that
was
linked
in
mole
s
of
a
faint
sort
of
electric
thrill
that
was
passing
down
that
animal
s
body
instantly
he
disengaged
himself
fell
back
a
pace
and
waited
all
attention
the
signals
were
coming
through
mole
stood
a
moment
rigid
while
his
uplifted
nose
quivering
slightly
felt
the
air
then
a
short
quick
run
forward
a
fault
a
check
a
try
back
and
then
a
slow
steady
confident
advance
the
rat
much
excited
kept
close
to
his
heels
as
the
mole
with
something
of
the
air
of
a
crossed
a
dry
ditch
scrambled
through
a
hedge
and
nosed
his
way
over
a
field
open
and
trackless
and
bare
in
the
faint
starlight
suddenly
without
giving
warning
he
dived
but
the
rat
was
on
the
alert
and
promptly
followed
him
down
the
tunnel
to
which
his
unerring
nose
had
faithfully
led
him
it
was
close
and
airless
and
the
earthy
smell
was
strong
and
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
rat
ere
the
passage
ended
and
he
could
stand
erect
and
stretch
and
shake
himself
the
mole
struck
a
match
and
by
its
light
the
rat
saw
that
they
were
standing
in
an
open
space
neatly
swept
and
sanded
underfoot
and
directly
facing
them
was
mole
s
little
front
door
with
mole
end
painted
in
gothic
lettering
over
the
at
the
side
mole
reached
down
a
lantern
from
a
nail
on
the
wall
and
lit
it
and
the
rat
looking
round
him
saw
that
they
were
in
a
sort
of
a
stood
on
one
side
of
the
door
and
on
the
other
a
roller
for
the
mole
who
was
a
tidy
animal
when
at
home
could
not
stand
having
his
ground
kicked
up
by
other
animals
into
little
runs
that
ended
in
on
the
walls
hung
wire
baskets
with
ferns
in
them
alternating
with
brackets
carrying
plaster
statuary
garibaldi
and
the
infant
samuel
and
queen
victoria
and
other
heroes
of
modern
italy
down
on
one
side
of
the
forecourt
ran
a
with
benches
along
it
and
little
wooden
tables
marked
with
rings
that
hinted
at
in
the
middle
was
a
small
round
pond
containing
and
surrounded
by
a
border
out
of
the
centre
of
the
pond
rose
a
fanciful
erection
clothed
in
more
and
topped
by
a
large
silvered
glass
ball
that
reflected
everything
all
wrong
and
had
a
very
pleasing
effect
mole
s
at
the
sight
of
all
these
objects
so
dear
to
him
and
he
hurried
rat
through
the
door
lit
a
lamp
in
the
hall
and
took
one
glance
round
his
old
home
he
saw
the
dust
lying
thick
on
everything
saw
the
cheerless
deserted
look
of
the
house
and
its
narrow
meagre
dimensions
its
worn
and
shabby
contents
and
collapsed
again
on
a
his
nose
to
his
paws
o
ratty
he
cried
dismally
why
ever
did
i
do
it
why
did
i
bring
you
to
this
poor
cold
little
place
on
a
night
like
this
when
you
might
have
been
at
river
bank
by
this
time
toasting
your
toes
before
a
blazing
fire
with
all
your
own
nice
things
about
you
the
rat
paid
no
heed
to
his
doleful
he
was
running
here
and
there
opening
doors
inspecting
rooms
and
cupboards
and
lighting
lamps
and
candles
and
sticking
them
up
everywhere
what
a
capital
little
house
this
is
he
called
out
cheerily
so
compact
so
well
planned
everything
here
and
everything
in
its
place
we
ll
make
a
jolly
night
of
it
the
first
thing
we
want
is
a
good
fire
i
ll
see
to
that
i
always
know
where
to
find
things
so
this
is
the
parlour
splendid
your
own
idea
those
little
in
the
wall
capital
now
i
ll
fetch
the
wood
and
the
coals
and
you
get
a
duster
mole
you
ll
find
one
in
the
drawer
of
the
kitchen
table
and
try
and
smarten
things
up
a
bit
bustle
about
old
chap
encouraged
by
his
inspiriting
companion
the
mole
roused
himself
and
dusted
and
polished
with
energy
and
heartiness
while
the
rat
running
to
and
fro
with
armfuls
of
fuel
soon
had
a
cheerful
blaze
roaring
up
the
chimney
he
hailed
the
mole
to
come
and
warm
himself
but
mole
promptly
had
another
fit
of
the
blues
dropping
down
on
a
couch
in
dark
despair
and
burying
his
face
in
his
duster
rat
he
moaned
how
about
your
supper
you
poor
cold
hungry
weary
animal
i
ve
nothing
to
give
you
nothing
not
a
crumb
what
a
fellow
you
are
for
giving
in
said
the
rat
reproachfully
why
only
just
now
i
saw
a
on
the
kitchen
dresser
quite
distinctly
and
everybody
knows
that
means
there
are
sardines
about
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
rouse
yourself
pull
yourself
together
and
come
with
me
and
they
went
and
foraged
accordingly
hunting
through
every
cupboard
and
turning
out
every
drawer
the
result
was
not
so
very
depressing
after
all
though
of
course
it
might
have
been
better
a
tin
of
sardines
a
box
of
captain
s
biscuits
nearly
full
and
a
german
sausage
encased
in
silver
paper
there
s
a
banquet
for
you
observed
the
rat
as
he
arranged
the
table
i
know
some
animals
who
would
give
their
ears
to
be
sitting
down
to
supper
with
us
no
bread
groaned
the
mole
dolorously
no
butter
no
no
pate
de
foie
gras
no
champagne
continued
the
rat
grinning
and
that
reminds
me
what
s
that
little
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
your
cellar
of
course
every
luxury
in
this
house
just
you
wait
a
he
made
for
the
and
presently
reappeared
somewhat
dusty
with
a
bottle
of
beer
in
each
paw
and
another
under
each
arm
beggar
you
seem
to
be
mole
he
observed
deny
yourself
nothing
this
is
really
the
jolliest
little
place
i
ever
was
in
now
wherever
did
you
pick
up
those
prints
make
the
place
look
so
they
do
no
wonder
you
re
so
fond
of
it
mole
tell
us
all
about
it
and
how
you
came
to
make
it
what
it
then
while
the
rat
busied
himself
fetching
plates
and
knives
and
forks
and
mustard
which
he
mixed
in
an
the
mole
his
bosom
still
heaving
with
the
stress
of
his
recent
emotion
related
somewhat
shyly
at
first
but
with
more
freedom
as
he
warmed
to
his
subject
how
this
was
planned
and
how
that
was
thought
out
and
how
this
was
got
through
a
windfall
from
an
aunt
and
that
was
a
wonderful
find
and
a
bargain
and
this
other
thing
was
bought
out
of
laborious
savings
and
a
certain
amount
of
going
his
spirits
finally
quite
restored
he
must
needs
go
and
caress
his
possessions
and
take
a
lamp
and
show
off
their
points
to
his
visitor
and
expatiate
on
them
quite
forgetful
of
the
supper
they
both
so
much
needed
rat
who
was
desperately
hungry
but
strove
to
conceal
it
nodding
seriously
examining
with
a
puckered
brow
and
saying
wonderful
and
most
remarkable
at
intervals
when
the
chance
for
an
observation
was
given
him
at
last
the
rat
succeeded
in
decoying
him
to
the
table
and
had
just
got
seriously
to
work
with
the
when
sounds
were
heard
from
the
without
sounds
like
the
scuffling
of
small
feet
in
the
gravel
and
a
confused
murmur
of
tiny
voices
while
broken
sentences
reached
them
now
all
in
a
line
hold
the
lantern
up
a
bit
tommy
clear
your
throats
first
no
coughing
after
i
say
one
two
where
s
young
bill
here
come
on
do
we
re
all
what
s
up
inquired
the
rat
pausing
in
his
labours
i
think
it
must
be
the
replied
the
mole
with
a
touch
of
pride
in
his
manner
they
go
round
regularly
at
this
time
of
the
year
they
re
quite
an
institution
in
these
parts
and
they
never
pass
me
over
they
come
to
mole
end
last
of
all
and
i
used
to
give
them
hot
drinks
and
supper
too
sometimes
when
i
could
afford
it
it
will
be
like
old
times
to
hear
them
let
s
have
a
look
at
them
cried
the
rat
jumping
up
and
running
to
the
door
it
was
a
pretty
sight
and
a
seasonable
one
that
met
their
eyes
when
they
flung
the
door
open
in
the
lit
by
the
dim
rays
of
a
horn
lantern
some
eight
or
ten
little
fieldmice
stood
in
a
semicircle
red
worsted
comforters
round
their
throats
their
thrust
deep
into
their
pockets
their
feet
jigging
for
warmth
with
bright
beady
eyes
they
glanced
shyly
at
each
other
sniggering
a
little
sniffing
and
applying
a
good
deal
as
the
door
opened
one
of
the
elder
ones
that
carried
the
lantern
was
just
saying
now
then
one
two
three
and
forthwith
their
shrill
little
voices
uprose
on
the
air
singing
one
of
the
carols
that
their
forefathers
composed
in
fields
that
were
fallow
and
held
by
frost
or
when
in
chimney
corners
and
handed
down
to
be
sung
in
the
miry
street
to
windows
at
carol
villagers
all
this
frosty
tide
let
your
doors
swing
open
wide
though
wind
may
follow
and
snow
beside
yet
draw
us
in
by
your
fire
to
bide
joy
shall
be
yours
in
the
morning
here
we
stand
in
the
cold
and
the
sleet
blowing
fingers
and
stamping
feet
come
from
far
away
you
to
greet
you
by
the
fire
and
we
in
the
street
bidding
you
joy
in
the
morning
for
ere
one
half
of
the
night
was
gone
sudden
a
star
has
led
us
on
raining
bliss
and
benison
bliss
and
more
anon
joy
for
every
morning
goodman
joseph
toiled
through
the
snow
saw
the
star
o
er
a
stable
low
mary
she
might
not
further
go
welcome
thatch
and
litter
below
joy
was
hers
in
the
morning
and
then
they
heard
the
angels
tell
who
were
the
first
to
cry
nowell
animals
all
as
it
befell
in
the
stable
where
they
did
dwell
joy
shall
be
theirs
in
the
morning
the
voices
ceased
the
singers
bashful
but
smiling
exchanged
sidelong
glances
and
silence
succeeded
but
for
a
moment
only
then
from
up
above
and
far
away
down
the
tunnel
they
had
so
lately
travelled
was
borne
to
their
ears
in
a
faint
musical
hum
the
sound
of
distant
bells
ringing
a
joyful
and
clangorous
peal
very
well
sung
boys
cried
the
rat
heartily
and
now
come
along
in
all
of
you
and
warm
yourselves
by
the
fire
and
have
something
hot
yes
come
along
cried
the
mole
eagerly
this
is
quite
like
old
times
shut
the
door
after
you
pull
up
that
settle
to
the
fire
now
you
just
wait
a
minute
while
we
o
ratty
he
cried
in
despair
plumping
down
on
a
seat
with
tears
impending
whatever
are
we
doing
we
ve
nothing
to
give
them
you
leave
all
that
to
me
said
the
masterful
rat
here
you
with
the
lantern
come
over
this
way
i
want
to
talk
to
you
now
tell
me
are
there
any
shops
open
at
this
hour
of
the
night
why
certainly
sir
replied
the
respectfully
at
this
time
of
the
year
our
shops
keep
open
to
all
sorts
of
then
look
here
said
the
rat
you
go
off
at
once
you
and
your
lantern
and
you
get
me
here
much
muttered
conversation
ensued
and
the
mole
only
heard
bits
of
it
such
as
fresh
mind
no
a
pound
of
that
will
do
see
you
get
buggins
s
for
i
won
t
have
any
other
no
only
the
best
if
you
can
t
get
it
there
try
somewhere
else
yes
of
course
no
tinned
stuff
well
then
do
the
best
you
can
finally
there
was
a
chink
of
coin
passing
from
paw
to
paw
the
was
provided
with
an
ample
basket
for
his
purchases
and
off
he
hurried
he
and
his
lantern
the
rest
of
the
perched
in
a
row
on
the
settle
their
small
legs
swinging
gave
themselves
up
to
enjoyment
of
the
fire
and
toasted
their
chilblains
till
they
tingled
while
the
mole
failing
to
draw
them
into
easy
conversation
plunged
into
family
history
and
made
each
of
them
recite
the
names
of
his
numerous
brothers
who
were
too
young
it
appeared
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
this
year
but
looked
forward
very
shortly
to
winning
the
parental
consent
the
rat
meanwhile
was
busy
examining
the
label
on
one
of
the
i
perceive
this
to
be
old
burton
he
remarked
approvingly
sensible
mole
the
very
thing
now
we
shall
be
able
to
mull
some
ale
get
the
things
ready
mole
while
i
draw
the
it
did
not
take
long
to
prepare
the
brew
and
thrust
the
tin
heater
well
into
the
red
heart
of
the
fire
and
soon
every
was
sipping
and
coughing
and
choking
for
a
little
mulled
ale
goes
a
long
way
and
wiping
his
eyes
and
laughing
and
forgetting
he
had
ever
been
cold
in
all
his
life
they
act
plays
too
these
fellows
the
mole
explained
to
the
rat
make
them
up
all
by
themselves
and
act
them
afterwards
and
very
well
they
do
it
too
they
gave
us
a
capital
one
last
year
about
a
who
was
captured
at
sea
by
a
barbary
corsair
and
made
to
row
in
a
galley
and
when
he
escaped
and
got
home
again
his
had
gone
into
a
convent
here
you
you
were
in
it
i
remember
get
up
and
recite
a
the
addressed
got
up
on
his
legs
giggled
shyly
looked
round
the
room
and
remained
absolutely
his
comrades
cheered
him
on
mole
coaxed
and
encouraged
him
and
the
rat
went
so
far
as
to
take
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shake
him
but
nothing
could
overcome
his
they
were
all
busily
engaged
on
him
like
watermen
applying
the
royal
humane
society
s
regulations
to
a
case
of
long
submersion
when
the
latch
clicked
the
door
opened
and
the
with
the
lantern
reappeared
staggering
under
the
weight
of
his
basket
there
was
no
more
talk
of
once
the
very
real
and
solid
contents
of
the
basket
had
been
tumbled
out
on
the
table
under
the
generalship
of
rat
everybody
was
set
to
do
something
or
to
fetch
something
in
a
very
few
minutes
supper
was
ready
and
mole
as
he
took
the
head
of
the
table
in
a
sort
of
a
dream
saw
a
lately
barren
board
set
thick
with
savoury
comforts
saw
his
little
friends
faces
brighten
and
beam
as
they
fell
to
without
delay
and
then
let
himself
loose
for
he
was
famished
indeed
on
the
provender
so
magically
provided
thinking
what
a
happy
this
had
turned
out
after
all
as
they
ate
they
talked
of
old
times
and
the
gave
him
the
local
gossip
up
to
date
and
answered
as
well
as
they
could
the
hundred
questions
he
had
to
ask
them
the
rat
said
little
or
nothing
only
taking
care
that
each
guest
had
what
he
wanted
and
plenty
of
it
and
that
mole
had
no
trouble
or
anxiety
about
anything
they
clattered
off
at
last
very
grateful
and
showering
wishes
of
the
season
with
their
jacket
pockets
stuffed
with
remembrances
for
the
small
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
when
the
door
had
closed
on
the
last
of
them
and
the
chink
of
the
lanterns
had
died
away
mole
and
rat
kicked
the
fire
up
drew
their
chairs
in
brewed
themselves
a
last
nightcap
of
mulled
ale
and
discussed
the
events
of
the
long
day
at
last
the
rat
with
a
tremendous
yawn
said
mole
old
chap
i
m
ready
to
drop
sleepy
is
simply
not
the
word
that
your
own
bunk
over
on
that
side
very
well
then
i
ll
take
this
what
a
ripping
little
house
this
is
everything
so
handy
he
clambered
into
his
bunk
and
rolled
himself
well
up
in
the
blankets
and
slumber
gathered
him
forthwith
as
a
swathe
of
barley
is
folded
into
the
arms
of
the
reaping
machine
the
weary
mole
also
was
glad
to
turn
in
without
delay
and
soon
had
his
head
on
his
pillow
in
great
joy
and
contentment
but
ere
he
closed
his
eyes
he
let
them
wander
round
his
old
room
mellow
in
the
glow
of
the
firelight
that
played
or
rested
on
familiar
and
friendly
things
which
had
long
been
unconsciously
a
part
of
him
and
now
smilingly
received
him
back
without
rancour
he
was
now
in
just
the
frame
of
mind
that
the
tactful
rat
had
quietly
worked
to
bring
about
in
him
he
saw
clearly
how
plain
and
simple
how
narrow
even
it
all
was
but
clearly
too
how
much
it
all
meant
to
him
and
the
special
value
of
some
such
anchorage
in
one
s
existence
he
did
not
at
all
want
to
abandon
the
new
life
and
its
splendid
spaces
to
turn
his
back
on
sun
and
air
and
all
they
offered
him
and
creep
home
and
stay
there
the
upper
world
was
all
too
strong
it
called
to
him
still
even
down
there
and
he
knew
he
must
return
to
the
larger
stage
but
it
was
good
to
think
he
had
this
to
come
back
to
this
place
which
was
all
his
own
these
things
which
were
so
glad
to
see
him
again
and
could
always
be
counted
upon
for
the
same
simple
welcome
vi
toad
it
was
a
bright
morning
in
the
early
part
of
summer
the
river
had
resumed
its
wonted
banks
and
its
accustomed
pace
and
a
hot
sun
seemed
to
be
pulling
everything
green
and
bushy
and
spiky
up
out
of
the
earth
towards
him
as
if
by
strings
the
mole
and
the
water
rat
had
been
up
since
dawn
very
busy
on
matters
connected
with
boats
and
the
opening
of
the
boating
season
painting
and
varnishing
mending
paddles
repairing
cushions
hunting
for
missing
and
so
on
and
were
finishing
breakfast
in
their
little
parlour
and
eagerly
discussing
their
plans
for
the
day
when
a
heavy
knock
sounded
at
the
door
bother
said
the
rat
all
over
egg
see
who
it
is
mole
like
a
good
chap
since
you
ve
the
mole
went
to
attend
the
summons
and
the
rat
heard
him
utter
a
cry
of
surprise
then
he
flung
the
parlour
door
open
and
announced
with
much
importance
mr
badger
this
was
a
wonderful
thing
indeed
that
the
badger
should
pay
a
formal
call
on
them
or
indeed
on
anybody
he
generally
had
to
be
caught
if
you
wanted
him
badly
as
he
slipped
quietly
along
a
hedgerow
of
an
early
morning
or
a
late
evening
or
else
hunted
up
in
his
own
house
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
which
was
a
serious
undertaking
the
badger
strode
heavily
into
the
room
and
stood
looking
at
the
two
animals
with
an
expression
full
of
seriousness
the
rat
let
his
fall
on
the
and
sat
the
hour
has
come
said
the
badger
at
last
with
great
solemnity
what
hour
asked
the
rat
uneasily
glancing
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
whose
hour
you
should
rather
say
replied
the
badger
why
toad
s
hour
the
hour
of
toad
i
said
i
would
take
him
in
hand
as
soon
as
the
winter
was
well
over
and
i
m
going
to
take
him
in
hand
toad
s
hour
of
course
cried
the
mole
delightedly
hooray
i
remember
now
we
ll
teach
him
to
be
a
sensible
toad
this
very
morning
continued
the
badger
taking
an
as
i
learnt
last
night
from
a
trustworthy
source
another
new
and
exceptionally
powerful
will
arrive
at
toad
hall
on
approval
or
return
at
this
very
moment
perhaps
toad
is
busy
arraying
himself
in
those
singularly
hideous
habiliments
so
dear
to
him
which
transform
him
from
a
comparatively
toad
into
an
object
which
throws
any
animal
that
comes
across
it
into
a
violent
fit
we
must
be
up
and
doing
ere
it
is
too
late
you
two
animals
will
accompany
me
instantly
to
toad
hall
and
the
work
of
rescue
shall
be
right
you
are
cried
the
rat
starting
up
we
ll
rescue
the
poor
unhappy
animal
we
ll
convert
him
he
ll
be
the
most
converted
toad
that
ever
was
before
we
ve
done
with
him
they
set
off
up
the
road
on
their
mission
of
mercy
badger
leading
the
way
animals
when
in
company
walk
in
a
proper
and
sensible
manner
in
single
file
instead
of
sprawling
all
across
the
road
and
being
of
no
use
or
support
to
each
other
in
case
of
sudden
trouble
or
danger
they
reached
the
of
toad
hall
to
find
as
the
badger
had
anticipated
a
shiny
new
of
great
size
painted
a
bright
red
toad
s
favourite
colour
standing
in
front
of
the
house
as
they
neared
the
door
it
was
flung
open
and
toad
arrayed
in
goggles
cap
gaiters
and
enormous
overcoat
came
swaggering
down
the
steps
drawing
on
his
gauntleted
gloves
hullo
come
on
you
fellows
he
cried
cheerfully
on
catching
sight
of
them
you
re
just
in
time
to
come
with
me
for
a
jolly
to
come
for
a
jolly
for
a
er
jolly
his
hearty
accents
faltered
and
fell
away
as
he
noticed
the
stern
unbending
look
on
the
countenances
of
his
silent
friends
and
his
invitation
remained
unfinished
the
badger
strode
up
the
steps
take
him
inside
he
said
sternly
to
his
companions
then
as
toad
was
hustled
through
the
door
struggling
and
protesting
he
turned
to
the
chauffeur
in
charge
of
the
new
i
m
afraid
you
won
t
be
wanted
he
said
mr
toad
has
changed
his
mind
he
will
not
require
the
car
please
understand
that
this
is
final
you
needn
t
then
he
followed
the
others
inside
and
shut
the
door
now
then
he
said
to
the
toad
when
the
four
of
them
stood
together
in
the
hall
first
of
all
take
those
ridiculous
things
off
shan
t
replied
toad
with
great
spirit
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
gross
outrage
i
demand
an
instant
take
them
off
him
then
you
two
ordered
the
badger
briefly
they
had
to
lay
toad
out
on
the
floor
kicking
and
calling
all
sorts
of
names
before
they
could
get
to
work
properly
then
the
rat
sat
on
him
and
the
mole
got
his
off
him
bit
by
bit
and
they
stood
him
up
on
his
legs
again
a
good
deal
of
his
blustering
spirit
seemed
to
have
evaporated
with
the
removal
of
his
fine
panoply
now
that
he
was
merely
toad
and
no
longer
the
terror
of
the
highway
he
giggled
feebly
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
appealingly
seeming
quite
to
understand
the
situation
you
knew
it
must
come
to
this
sooner
or
later
toad
the
badger
explained
severely
you
ve
disregarded
all
the
warnings
we
ve
given
you
you
ve
gone
on
squandering
the
money
your
father
left
you
and
you
re
getting
us
animals
a
bad
name
in
the
district
by
your
furious
driving
and
your
smashes
and
your
rows
with
the
police
independence
is
all
very
well
but
we
animals
never
allow
our
friends
to
make
fools
of
themselves
beyond
a
certain
limit
and
that
limit
you
ve
reached
now
you
re
a
good
fellow
in
many
respects
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
too
hard
on
you
i
ll
make
one
more
effort
to
bring
you
to
reason
you
will
come
with
me
into
the
and
there
you
will
hear
some
facts
about
yourself
and
we
ll
see
whether
you
come
out
of
that
room
the
same
toad
that
you
went
he
took
toad
firmly
by
the
arm
led
him
into
the
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
that
s
no
good
said
the
rat
contemptuously
talking
to
toad
ll
never
cure
him
he
ll
say
they
made
themselves
comfortable
in
armchairs
and
waited
patiently
through
the
closed
door
they
could
just
hear
the
long
continuous
drone
of
the
badger
s
voice
rising
and
falling
in
waves
of
oratory
and
presently
they
noticed
that
the
sermon
began
to
be
punctuated
at
intervals
by
sobs
evidently
proceeding
from
the
bosom
of
toad
who
was
a
and
affectionate
fellow
very
easily
converted
for
the
time
being
to
any
point
of
view
after
some
of
an
hour
the
door
opened
and
the
badger
reappeared
solemnly
leading
by
the
paw
a
very
limp
and
dejected
toad
his
skin
hung
baggily
about
him
his
legs
wobbled
and
his
cheeks
were
furrowed
by
the
tears
so
plentifully
called
forth
by
the
badger
s
moving
discourse
sit
down
there
toad
said
the
badger
kindly
pointing
to
a
chair
my
friends
he
went
on
i
am
pleased
to
inform
you
that
toad
has
at
last
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
he
is
truly
sorry
for
his
misguided
conduct
in
the
past
and
he
has
undertaken
to
give
up
entirely
and
for
ever
i
have
his
solemn
promise
to
that
that
is
very
good
news
said
the
mole
gravely
very
good
news
indeed
observed
the
rat
dubiously
if
only
if
only
he
was
looking
very
hard
at
toad
as
he
said
this
and
could
not
help
thinking
he
perceived
something
vaguely
resembling
a
twinkle
in
that
animal
s
still
sorrowful
eye
there
s
only
one
thing
more
to
be
done
continued
the
gratified
badger
toad
i
want
you
solemnly
to
repeat
before
your
friends
here
what
you
fully
admitted
to
me
in
the
just
now
first
you
are
sorry
for
what
you
ve
done
and
you
see
the
folly
of
it
all
there
was
a
long
long
pause
toad
looked
desperately
this
way
and
that
while
the
other
animals
waited
in
grave
silence
at
last
he
spoke
no
he
said
a
little
sullenly
but
stoutly
i
m
not
sorry
and
it
wasn
t
folly
at
all
it
was
simply
glorious
what
cried
the
badger
greatly
scandalised
you
backsliding
animal
didn
t
you
tell
me
just
now
in
there
oh
yes
yes
in
there
said
toad
impatiently
i
d
have
said
anything
in
there
you
re
so
eloquent
dear
badger
and
so
moving
and
so
convincing
and
put
all
your
points
so
frightfully
well
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
me
in
there
and
you
know
it
but
i
ve
been
searching
my
mind
since
and
going
over
things
in
it
and
i
find
that
i
m
not
a
bit
sorry
or
repentant
really
so
it
s
no
earthly
good
saying
i
am
now
is
it
then
you
don
t
promise
said
the
badger
never
to
touch
a
again
certainly
not
replied
toad
emphatically
on
the
contrary
i
faithfully
promise
that
the
very
first
i
see
off
i
go
in
it
told
you
so
didn
t
i
observed
the
rat
to
the
mole
very
well
then
said
the
badger
firmly
rising
to
his
feet
since
you
won
t
yield
to
persuasion
we
ll
try
what
force
can
do
i
feared
it
would
come
to
this
all
along
you
ve
often
asked
us
three
to
come
and
stay
with
you
toad
in
this
handsome
house
of
yours
well
now
we
re
going
to
when
we
ve
converted
you
to
a
proper
point
of
view
we
may
quit
but
not
before
take
him
upstairs
you
two
and
lock
him
up
in
his
bedroom
while
we
arrange
matters
between
it
s
for
your
own
good
toady
you
know
said
the
rat
kindly
as
toad
kicking
and
struggling
was
hauled
up
the
stairs
by
his
two
faithful
friends
think
what
fun
we
shall
all
have
together
just
as
we
used
to
when
you
ve
quite
got
over
this
this
painful
attack
of
yours
we
ll
take
great
care
of
everything
for
you
till
you
re
well
toad
said
the
mole
and
we
ll
see
your
money
isn
t
wasted
as
it
has
no
more
of
those
regrettable
incidents
with
the
police
toad
said
the
rat
as
they
thrust
him
into
his
bedroom
and
no
more
weeks
in
hospital
being
ordered
about
by
female
nurses
toad
added
the
mole
turning
the
key
on
him
they
descended
the
stair
toad
shouting
abuse
at
them
through
the
keyhole
and
the
three
friends
then
met
in
conference
on
the
situation
it
s
going
to
be
a
tedious
business
said
the
badger
sighing
i
ve
never
seen
toad
so
determined
however
we
will
see
it
out
he
must
never
be
left
an
instant
unguarded
we
shall
have
to
take
it
in
turns
to
be
with
him
till
the
poison
has
worked
itself
out
of
his
they
arranged
watches
accordingly
each
animal
took
it
in
turns
to
sleep
in
toad
s
room
at
night
and
they
divided
the
day
up
between
them
at
first
toad
was
undoubtedly
very
trying
to
his
careful
guardians
when
his
violent
paroxysms
possessed
him
he
would
arrange
bedroom
chairs
in
rude
resemblance
of
a
and
would
crouch
on
the
foremost
of
them
bent
forward
and
staring
fixedly
ahead
making
uncouth
and
ghastly
noises
till
the
climax
was
reached
when
turning
a
complete
somersault
he
would
lie
prostrate
amidst
the
ruins
of
the
chairs
apparently
completely
satisfied
for
the
moment
as
time
passed
however
these
painful
seizures
grew
gradually
less
frequent
and
his
friends
strove
to
divert
his
mind
into
fresh
channels
but
his
interest
in
other
matters
did
not
seem
to
revive
and
he
grew
apparently
languid
and
depressed
one
fine
morning
the
rat
whose
turn
it
was
to
go
on
duty
went
upstairs
to
relieve
badger
whom
he
found
fidgeting
to
be
off
and
stretch
his
legs
in
a
long
ramble
round
his
wood
and
down
his
earths
and
burrows
toad
s
still
in
bed
he
told
the
rat
outside
the
door
can
t
get
much
out
of
him
except
o
leave
him
alone
he
wants
nothing
perhaps
he
ll
be
better
presently
it
may
pass
off
in
time
don
t
be
unduly
anxious
and
so
on
now
you
look
out
rat
when
toad
s
quiet
and
submissive
and
playing
at
being
the
hero
of
a
prize
then
he
s
at
his
artfullest
there
s
sure
to
be
something
up
i
know
him
well
now
i
must
be
how
are
you
old
chap
inquired
the
rat
cheerfully
as
he
approached
toad
s
bedside
he
had
to
wait
some
minutes
for
an
answer
at
last
a
feeble
voice
replied
thank
you
so
much
dear
ratty
so
good
of
you
to
inquire
but
first
tell
me
how
you
are
yourself
and
the
excellent
mole
o
we
re
all
right
replied
the
rat
mole
he
added
incautiously
is
going
out
for
a
run
round
with
badger
they
ll
be
out
till
luncheon
time
so
you
and
i
will
spend
a
pleasant
morning
together
and
i
ll
do
my
best
to
amuse
you
now
jump
up
there
s
a
good
fellow
and
don
t
lie
moping
there
on
a
fine
morning
like
this
dear
kind
rat
murmured
toad
how
little
you
realise
my
condition
and
how
very
far
i
am
from
jumping
up
now
if
ever
but
do
not
trouble
about
me
i
hate
being
a
burden
to
my
friends
and
i
do
not
expect
to
be
one
much
longer
indeed
i
almost
hope
well
i
hope
not
too
said
the
rat
heartily
you
ve
been
a
fine
bother
to
us
all
this
time
and
i
m
glad
to
hear
it
s
going
to
stop
and
in
weather
like
this
and
the
boating
season
just
beginning
it
s
too
bad
of
you
toad
it
isn
t
the
trouble
we
mind
but
you
re
making
us
miss
such
an
awful
i
m
afraid
it
is
the
trouble
you
mind
though
replied
the
toad
languidly
i
can
quite
understand
it
it
s
natural
enough
you
re
tired
of
bothering
about
me
i
mustn
t
ask
you
to
do
anything
further
i
m
a
nuisance
i
you
are
indeed
said
the
rat
but
i
tell
you
i
d
take
any
trouble
on
earth
for
you
if
only
you
d
be
a
sensible
if
i
thought
that
ratty
murmured
toad
more
feebly
than
ever
then
i
would
beg
you
for
the
last
time
probably
to
step
round
to
the
village
as
quickly
as
possible
even
now
it
may
be
too
late
and
fetch
the
doctor
but
don
t
you
bother
it
s
only
a
trouble
and
perhaps
we
may
as
well
let
things
take
their
why
what
do
you
want
a
doctor
for
inquired
the
rat
coming
closer
and
examining
him
he
certainly
lay
very
still
and
flat
and
his
voice
was
weaker
and
his
manner
much
changed
surely
you
have
noticed
of
late
murmured
toad
but
no
why
should
you
noticing
things
is
only
a
trouble
indeed
you
may
be
saying
to
yourself
o
if
only
i
had
noticed
sooner
if
only
i
had
done
something
but
no
it
s
a
trouble
never
mind
forget
that
i
look
here
old
man
said
the
rat
beginning
to
get
rather
alarmed
of
course
i
ll
fetch
a
doctor
to
you
if
you
really
think
you
want
him
but
you
can
hardly
be
bad
enough
for
that
yet
let
s
talk
about
something
i
fear
dear
friend
said
toad
with
a
sad
smile
that
talk
can
do
little
in
a
case
like
this
or
doctors
either
for
that
matter
still
one
must
grasp
at
the
slightest
straw
and
by
the
way
while
you
are
about
it
i
hate
to
give
you
additional
trouble
but
i
happen
to
remember
that
you
will
pass
the
door
would
you
mind
at
the
same
time
asking
the
lawyer
to
step
up
it
would
be
a
convenience
to
me
and
there
are
moments
perhaps
i
should
say
there
is
a
moment
when
one
must
face
disagreeable
tasks
at
whatever
cost
to
exhausted
nature
a
lawyer
o
he
must
be
really
bad
the
affrighted
rat
said
to
himself
as
he
hurried
from
the
room
not
forgetting
however
to
lock
the
door
carefully
behind
him
outside
he
stopped
to
consider
the
other
two
were
far
away
and
he
had
no
one
to
consult
it
s
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
said
on
reflection
i
ve
known
toad
fancy
himself
frightfully
bad
before
without
the
slightest
reason
but
i
ve
never
heard
him
ask
for
a
lawyer
if
there
s
nothing
really
the
matter
the
doctor
will
tell
him
he
s
an
old
ass
and
cheer
him
up
and
that
will
be
something
gained
i
d
better
humour
him
and
go
it
won
t
take
very
so
he
ran
off
to
the
village
on
his
errand
of
mercy
the
toad
who
had
hopped
lightly
out
of
bed
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
watched
him
eagerly
from
the
window
till
he
disappeared
down
the
then
laughing
heartily
he
dressed
as
quickly
as
possible
in
the
smartest
suit
he
could
lay
hands
on
at
the
moment
filled
his
pockets
with
cash
which
he
took
from
a
small
drawer
in
the
and
next
knotting
the
sheets
from
his
bed
together
and
tying
one
end
of
the
improvised
rope
round
the
central
mullion
of
the
handsome
tudor
window
which
formed
such
a
feature
of
his
bedroom
he
scrambled
out
slid
lightly
to
the
ground
and
taking
the
opposite
direction
to
the
rat
marched
off
lightheartedly
whistling
a
merry
tune
it
was
a
gloomy
luncheon
for
rat
when
the
badger
and
the
mole
at
length
returned
and
he
had
to
face
them
at
table
with
his
pitiful
and
unconvincing
story
the
badger
s
caustic
not
to
say
brutal
remarks
may
be
imagined
and
therefore
passed
over
but
it
was
painful
to
the
rat
that
even
the
mole
though
he
took
his
friend
s
side
as
far
as
possible
could
not
help
saying
you
ve
been
a
bit
of
a
duffer
this
time
ratty
toad
too
of
all
animals
he
did
it
awfully
well
said
the
crestfallen
rat
he
did
you
awfully
well
rejoined
the
badger
hotly
however
talking
won
t
mend
matters
he
s
got
clear
away
for
the
time
that
s
certain
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
ll
be
so
conceited
with
what
he
ll
think
is
his
cleverness
that
he
may
commit
any
folly
one
comfort
is
we
re
free
now
and
needn
t
waste
any
more
of
our
precious
time
doing
but
we
d
better
continue
to
sleep
at
toad
hall
for
a
while
longer
toad
may
be
brought
back
at
any
moment
on
a
stretcher
or
between
two
so
spoke
the
badger
not
knowing
what
the
future
held
in
store
or
how
much
water
and
of
how
turbid
a
character
was
to
run
under
bridges
before
toad
should
sit
at
ease
again
in
his
ancestral
hall
meanwhile
toad
gay
and
irresponsible
was
walking
briskly
along
the
high
road
some
miles
from
home
at
first
he
had
taken
and
crossed
many
fields
and
changed
his
course
several
times
in
case
of
pursuit
but
now
feeling
by
this
time
safe
from
recapture
and
the
sun
smiling
brightly
on
him
and
all
nature
joining
in
a
chorus
of
approval
to
the
song
of
that
his
own
heart
was
singing
to
him
he
almost
danced
along
the
road
in
his
satisfaction
and
conceit
smart
piece
of
work
that
he
remarked
to
himself
chuckling
brain
against
brute
force
and
brain
came
out
on
the
top
as
it
s
bound
to
do
poor
old
ratty
my
won
t
he
catch
it
when
the
badger
gets
back
a
worthy
fellow
ratty
with
many
good
qualities
but
very
little
intelligence
and
absolutely
no
education
i
must
take
him
in
hand
some
day
and
see
if
i
can
make
something
of
filled
full
of
conceited
thoughts
such
as
these
he
strode
along
his
head
in
the
air
till
he
reached
a
little
town
where
the
sign
of
the
red
lion
swinging
across
the
road
halfway
down
the
main
street
reminded
him
that
he
had
not
breakfasted
that
day
and
that
he
was
exceedingly
hungry
after
his
long
walk
he
marched
into
the
inn
ordered
the
best
luncheon
that
could
be
provided
at
so
short
a
notice
and
sat
down
to
eat
it
in
the
he
was
about
through
his
meal
when
an
only
too
familiar
sound
approaching
down
the
street
made
him
start
and
fall
all
over
the
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
car
could
be
heard
to
turn
into
the
and
come
to
a
stop
and
toad
had
to
hold
on
to
the
leg
of
the
table
to
conceal
his
emotion
presently
the
party
entered
the
hungry
talkative
and
gay
voluble
on
their
experiences
of
the
morning
and
the
merits
of
the
chariot
that
had
brought
them
along
so
well
toad
listened
eagerly
all
ears
for
a
time
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
slipped
out
of
the
room
quietly
paid
his
bill
at
the
bar
and
as
soon
as
he
got
outside
sauntered
round
quietly
to
the
there
can
not
be
any
harm
he
said
to
himself
in
my
only
just
looking
at
it
the
car
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
quite
unattended
the
and
other
being
all
at
their
dinner
toad
walked
slowly
round
it
inspecting
criticising
musing
deeply
i
wonder
he
said
to
himself
presently
i
wonder
if
this
sort
of
car
starts
easily
next
moment
hardly
knowing
how
it
came
about
he
found
he
had
hold
of
the
handle
and
was
turning
it
as
the
familiar
sound
broke
forth
the
old
passion
seized
on
toad
and
completely
mastered
him
body
and
soul
as
if
in
a
dream
he
found
himself
somehow
seated
in
the
driver
s
seat
as
if
in
a
dream
he
pulled
the
lever
and
swung
the
car
round
the
yard
and
out
through
the
archway
and
as
if
in
a
dream
all
sense
of
right
and
wrong
all
fear
of
obvious
consequences
seemed
temporarily
suspended
he
increased
his
pace
and
as
the
car
devoured
the
street
and
leapt
forth
on
the
high
road
through
the
open
country
he
was
only
conscious
that
he
was
toad
once
more
toad
at
his
best
and
highest
toad
the
terror
the
the
lord
of
the
lone
trail
before
whom
all
must
give
way
or
be
smitten
into
nothingness
and
everlasting
night
he
chanted
as
he
flew
and
the
car
responded
with
sonorous
drone
the
miles
were
eaten
up
under
him
as
he
sped
he
knew
not
whither
fulfilling
his
instincts
living
his
hour
reckless
of
what
might
come
to
him
to
my
mind
observed
the
chairman
of
the
bench
of
magistrates
cheerfully
the
only
difficulty
that
presents
itself
in
this
otherwise
very
clear
case
is
how
we
can
possibly
make
it
sufficiently
hot
for
the
incorrigible
rogue
and
hardened
ruffian
whom
we
see
cowering
in
the
dock
before
us
let
me
see
he
has
been
found
guilty
on
the
clearest
evidence
first
of
stealing
a
valuable
secondly
of
driving
to
the
public
danger
and
thirdly
of
gross
impertinence
to
the
rural
police
mr
clerk
will
you
tell
us
please
what
is
the
very
stiffest
penalty
we
can
impose
for
each
of
these
offences
without
of
course
giving
the
prisoner
the
benefit
of
any
doubt
because
there
isn
t
the
clerk
scratched
his
nose
with
his
pen
some
people
would
consider
he
observed
that
stealing
the
was
the
worst
offence
and
so
it
is
but
cheeking
the
police
undoubtedly
carries
the
severest
penalty
and
so
it
ought
supposing
you
were
to
say
twelve
months
for
the
theft
which
is
mild
and
three
years
for
the
furious
driving
which
is
lenient
and
fifteen
years
for
the
cheek
which
was
pretty
bad
sort
of
cheek
judging
by
what
we
ve
heard
from
the
even
if
you
only
believe
part
of
what
you
heard
and
i
never
believe
more
myself
those
figures
if
added
together
correctly
tot
up
to
nineteen
years
said
the
chairman
so
you
had
better
make
it
a
round
twenty
years
and
be
on
the
safe
side
concluded
the
clerk
an
excellent
suggestion
said
the
chairman
approvingly
prisoner
pull
yourself
together
and
try
and
stand
up
straight
it
s
going
to
be
twenty
years
for
you
this
time
and
mind
if
you
appear
before
us
again
upon
any
charge
whatever
we
shall
have
to
deal
with
you
very
seriously
then
the
brutal
minions
of
the
law
fell
upon
the
hapless
toad
loaded
him
with
chains
and
dragged
him
from
the
court
house
shrieking
praying
protesting
across
the
marketplace
where
the
playful
populace
always
as
severe
upon
detected
crime
as
they
are
sympathetic
and
helpful
when
one
is
merely
wanted
assailed
him
with
jeers
carrots
and
popular
past
hooting
school
children
their
innocent
faces
lit
up
with
the
pleasure
they
ever
derive
from
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
in
difficulties
across
the
drawbridge
below
the
spiky
portcullis
under
the
frowning
archway
of
the
grim
old
castle
whose
ancient
towers
soared
high
overhead
past
guardrooms
full
of
grinning
soldiery
off
duty
past
sentries
who
coughed
in
a
horrid
sarcastic
way
because
that
is
as
much
as
a
sentry
on
his
post
dare
do
to
show
his
contempt
and
abhorrence
of
crime
up
winding
stairs
past
in
casquet
and
corselet
of
steel
darting
threatening
looks
through
their
vizards
across
courtyards
where
mastiffs
strained
at
their
leash
and
pawed
the
air
to
get
at
him
past
ancient
warders
their
halberds
leant
against
the
wall
dozing
over
a
pasty
and
a
flagon
of
brown
ale
on
and
on
past
the
and
the
past
the
turning
that
led
to
the
private
scaffold
till
they
reached
the
door
of
the
grimmest
dungeon
that
lay
in
the
heart
of
the
innermost
keep
there
at
last
they
paused
where
an
ancient
gaoler
sat
fingering
a
bunch
of
mighty
keys
oddsbodikins
said
the
sergeant
of
police
taking
off
his
helmet
and
wiping
his
forehead
rouse
thee
old
loon
and
take
over
from
us
this
vile
toad
a
criminal
of
deepest
guilt
and
matchless
artfulness
and
resource
watch
and
ward
him
with
all
thy
skill
and
mark
thee
well
greybeard
should
aught
untoward
befall
thy
old
head
shall
answer
for
his
and
a
murrain
on
both
of
them
the
gaoler
nodded
grimly
laying
his
withered
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
miserable
toad
the
rusty
key
creaked
in
the
lock
the
great
door
clanged
behind
them
and
toad
was
a
helpless
prisoner
in
the
remotest
dungeon
of
the
keep
of
the
stoutest
castle
in
all
the
length
and
breadth
of
merry
england
vii
the
piper
at
the
gates
of
dawn
the
was
twittering
his
thin
little
song
hidden
himself
in
the
dark
selvedge
of
the
river
bank
though
it
was
past
ten
o
clock
at
night
the
sky
still
clung
to
and
retained
some
lingering
skirts
of
light
from
the
departed
day
and
the
sullen
heats
of
the
torrid
afternoon
broke
up
and
rolled
away
at
the
dispersing
touch
of
the
cool
fingers
of
the
short
midsummer
night
mole
lay
stretched
on
the
bank
still
panting
from
the
stress
of
the
fierce
day
that
had
been
cloudless
from
dawn
to
late
sunset
and
waited
for
his
friend
to
return
he
had
been
on
the
river
with
some
companions
leaving
the
water
rat
free
to
keep
a
engagement
of
long
standing
with
otter
and
he
had
come
back
to
find
the
house
dark
and
deserted
and
no
sign
of
rat
who
was
doubtless
keeping
it
up
late
with
his
old
comrade
it
was
still
too
hot
to
think
of
staying
indoors
so
he
lay
on
some
cool
and
thought
over
the
past
day
and
its
doings
and
how
very
good
they
all
had
been
the
rat
s
light
footfall
was
presently
heard
approaching
over
the
parched
grass
o
the
blessed
coolness
he
said
and
sat
down
gazing
thoughtfully
into
the
river
silent
and
you
stayed
to
supper
of
course
said
the
mole
presently
simply
had
to
said
the
rat
they
wouldn
t
hear
of
my
going
before
you
know
how
kind
they
always
are
and
they
made
things
as
jolly
for
me
as
ever
they
could
right
up
to
the
moment
i
left
but
i
felt
a
brute
all
the
time
as
it
was
clear
to
me
they
were
very
unhappy
though
they
tried
to
hide
it
mole
i
m
afraid
they
re
in
trouble
little
portly
is
missing
again
and
you
know
what
a
lot
his
father
thinks
of
him
though
he
never
says
much
about
what
that
child
said
the
mole
lightly
well
suppose
he
is
why
worry
about
it
he
s
always
straying
off
and
getting
lost
and
turning
up
again
he
s
so
adventurous
but
no
harm
ever
happens
to
him
everybody
hereabouts
knows
him
and
likes
him
just
as
they
do
old
otter
and
you
may
be
sure
some
animal
or
other
will
come
across
him
and
bring
him
back
again
all
right
why
we
ve
found
him
ourselves
miles
from
home
and
quite
and
cheerful
yes
but
this
time
it
s
more
serious
said
the
rat
gravely
he
s
been
missing
for
some
days
now
and
the
otters
have
hunted
everywhere
high
and
low
without
finding
the
slightest
trace
and
they
ve
asked
every
animal
too
for
miles
around
and
no
one
knows
anything
about
him
otter
s
evidently
more
anxious
than
he
ll
admit
i
got
out
of
him
that
young
portly
hasn
t
learnt
to
swim
very
well
yet
and
i
can
see
he
s
thinking
of
the
weir
there
s
a
lot
of
water
coming
down
still
considering
the
time
of
the
year
and
the
place
always
had
a
fascination
for
the
child
and
then
there
are
well
traps
and
things
you
know
otter
s
not
the
fellow
to
be
nervous
about
any
son
of
his
before
it
s
time
and
now
he
is
nervous
when
i
left
he
came
out
with
me
said
he
wanted
some
air
and
talked
about
stretching
his
legs
but
i
could
see
it
wasn
t
that
so
i
drew
him
out
and
pumped
him
and
got
it
all
from
him
at
last
he
was
going
to
spend
the
night
watching
by
the
ford
you
know
the
place
where
the
old
ford
used
to
be
in
days
before
they
built
the
bridge
i
know
it
well
said
the
mole
but
why
should
otter
choose
to
watch
there
well
it
seems
that
it
was
there
he
gave
portly
his
first
continued
the
rat
from
that
shallow
gravelly
spit
near
the
bank
and
it
was
there
he
used
to
teach
him
fishing
and
there
young
portly
caught
his
first
fish
of
which
he
was
so
very
proud
the
child
loved
the
spot
and
otter
thinks
that
if
he
came
wandering
back
from
wherever
he
is
if
he
is
anywhere
by
this
time
poor
little
chap
he
might
make
for
the
ford
he
was
so
fond
of
or
if
he
came
across
it
he
d
remember
it
well
and
stop
there
and
play
perhaps
so
otter
goes
there
every
night
and
watches
on
the
chance
you
know
just
on
the
chance
they
were
silent
for
a
time
both
thinking
of
the
same
thing
the
lonely
animal
crouched
by
the
ford
watching
and
waiting
the
long
night
through
on
the
chance
well
well
said
the
rat
presently
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
thinking
about
turning
but
he
never
offered
to
move
rat
said
the
mole
i
simply
can
t
go
and
turn
in
and
go
to
sleep
and
do
nothing
even
though
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
anything
to
be
done
we
ll
get
the
boat
out
and
paddle
up
stream
the
moon
will
be
up
in
an
hour
or
so
and
then
we
will
search
as
well
as
we
can
anyhow
it
will
be
better
than
going
to
bed
and
doing
just
what
i
was
thinking
myself
said
the
rat
it
s
not
the
sort
of
night
for
bed
anyhow
and
daybreak
is
not
so
very
far
off
and
then
we
may
pick
up
some
news
of
him
from
early
risers
as
we
go
they
got
the
boat
out
and
the
rat
took
the
sculls
paddling
with
caution
out
in
midstream
there
was
a
clear
narrow
track
that
faintly
reflected
the
sky
but
wherever
shadows
fell
on
the
water
from
bank
bush
or
tree
they
were
as
solid
to
all
appearance
as
the
banks
themselves
and
the
mole
had
to
steer
with
judgment
accordingly
dark
and
deserted
as
it
was
the
night
was
full
of
small
noises
song
and
chatter
and
rustling
telling
of
the
busy
little
population
who
were
up
and
about
plying
their
trades
and
vocations
through
the
night
till
sunshine
should
fall
on
them
at
last
and
send
them
off
to
their
repose
the
water
s
own
noises
too
were
more
apparent
than
by
day
its
gurglings
and
cloops
more
unexpected
and
near
at
hand
and
constantly
they
started
at
what
seemed
a
sudden
clear
call
from
an
actual
articulate
voice
the
line
of
the
horizon
was
clear
and
hard
against
the
sky
and
in
one
particular
quarter
it
showed
black
against
a
silvery
climbing
phosphorescence
that
grew
and
grew
at
last
over
the
rim
of
the
waiting
earth
the
moon
lifted
with
slow
majesty
till
it
swung
clear
of
the
horizon
and
rode
off
free
of
moorings
and
once
more
they
began
to
see
surfaces
meadows
and
quiet
gardens
and
the
river
itself
from
bank
to
bank
all
softly
disclosed
all
washed
clean
of
mystery
and
terror
all
radiant
again
as
by
day
but
with
a
difference
that
was
tremendous
their
old
haunts
greeted
them
again
in
other
raiment
as
if
they
had
slipped
away
and
put
on
this
pure
new
apparel
and
come
quietly
back
smiling
as
they
shyly
waited
to
see
if
they
would
be
recognised
again
under
it
fastening
their
boat
to
a
willow
the
friends
landed
in
this
silent
silver
kingdom
and
patiently
explored
the
hedges
the
hollow
trees
the
runnels
and
their
little
culverts
the
ditches
and
dry
embarking
again
and
crossing
over
they
worked
their
way
up
the
stream
in
this
manner
while
the
moon
serene
and
detached
in
a
cloudless
sky
did
what
she
could
though
so
far
off
to
help
them
in
their
quest
till
her
hour
came
and
she
sank
earthwards
reluctantly
and
left
them
and
mystery
once
more
held
field
and
river
then
a
change
began
slowly
to
declare
itself
the
horizon
became
clearer
field
and
tree
came
more
into
sight
and
somehow
with
a
different
look
the
mystery
began
to
drop
away
from
them
a
bird
piped
suddenly
and
was
still
and
a
light
breeze
sprang
up
and
set
the
reeds
and
bulrushes
rustling
rat
who
was
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
while
mole
sculled
sat
up
suddenly
and
listened
with
a
passionate
intentness
mole
who
with
gentle
strokes
was
just
keeping
the
boat
moving
while
he
scanned
the
banks
with
care
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
it
s
gone
sighed
the
rat
sinking
back
in
his
seat
again
so
beautiful
and
strange
and
new
since
it
was
to
end
so
soon
i
almost
wish
i
had
never
heard
it
for
it
has
roused
a
longing
in
me
that
is
pain
and
nothing
seems
worth
while
but
just
to
hear
that
sound
once
more
and
go
on
listening
to
it
for
ever
no
there
it
is
again
he
cried
alert
once
more
entranced
he
was
silent
for
a
long
space
spellbound
now
it
passes
on
and
i
begin
to
lose
it
he
said
presently
o
mole
the
beauty
of
it
the
merry
bubble
and
joy
the
thin
clear
happy
call
of
the
distant
piping
such
music
i
never
dreamed
of
and
the
call
in
it
is
stronger
even
than
the
music
is
sweet
row
on
mole
row
for
the
music
and
the
call
must
be
for
the
mole
greatly
wondering
obeyed
i
hear
nothing
myself
he
said
but
the
wind
playing
in
the
reeds
and
rushes
and
the
rat
never
answered
if
indeed
he
heard
rapt
transported
trembling
he
was
possessed
in
all
his
senses
by
this
new
divine
thing
that
caught
up
his
helpless
soul
and
swung
and
dandled
it
a
powerless
but
happy
infant
in
a
strong
sustaining
grasp
in
silence
mole
rowed
steadily
and
soon
they
came
to
a
point
where
the
river
divided
a
long
backwater
branching
off
to
one
side
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
rat
who
had
long
dropped
the
directed
the
rower
to
take
the
backwater
the
creeping
tide
of
light
gained
and
gained
and
now
they
could
see
the
colour
of
the
flowers
that
gemmed
the
water
s
edge
clearer
and
nearer
still
cried
the
rat
joyously
now
you
must
surely
hear
it
ah
at
last
i
see
you
do
breathless
and
transfixed
the
mole
stopped
rowing
as
the
liquid
run
of
that
glad
piping
broke
on
him
like
a
wave
caught
him
up
and
possessed
him
utterly
he
saw
the
tears
on
his
comrade
s
cheeks
and
bowed
his
head
and
understood
for
a
space
they
hung
there
brushed
by
the
purple
that
fringed
the
bank
then
the
clear
imperious
summons
that
marched
with
the
intoxicating
melody
imposed
its
will
on
mole
and
mechanically
he
bent
to
his
oars
again
and
the
light
grew
steadily
stronger
but
no
birds
sang
as
they
were
wont
to
do
at
the
approach
of
dawn
and
but
for
the
heavenly
music
all
was
marvellously
still
on
either
side
of
them
as
they
glided
onwards
the
rich
seemed
that
morning
of
a
freshness
and
a
greenness
unsurpassable
never
had
they
noticed
the
roses
so
vivid
the
so
riotous
the
so
odorous
and
pervading
then
the
murmur
of
the
approaching
weir
began
to
hold
the
air
and
they
felt
a
consciousness
that
they
were
nearing
the
end
whatever
it
might
be
that
surely
awaited
their
expedition
a
wide
of
foam
and
glinting
lights
and
shining
shoulders
of
green
water
the
great
weir
closed
the
backwater
from
bank
to
bank
troubled
all
the
quiet
surface
with
twirling
eddies
and
floating
and
deadened
all
other
sounds
with
its
solemn
and
soothing
rumble
in
midmost
of
the
stream
embraced
in
the
weir
s
shimmering
a
small
island
lay
anchored
fringed
close
with
willow
and
silver
birch
and
alder
reserved
shy
but
full
of
significance
it
hid
whatever
it
might
hold
behind
a
veil
keeping
it
till
the
hour
should
come
and
with
the
hour
those
who
were
called
and
chosen
slowly
but
with
no
doubt
or
hesitation
whatever
and
in
something
of
a
solemn
expectancy
the
two
animals
passed
through
the
broken
tumultuous
water
and
moored
their
boat
at
the
flowery
margin
of
the
island
in
silence
they
landed
and
pushed
through
the
blossom
and
scented
herbage
and
undergrowth
that
led
up
to
the
level
ground
till
they
stood
on
a
little
lawn
of
a
marvellous
green
set
round
with
nature
s
own
wild
cherry
and
sloe
this
is
the
place
of
my
the
place
the
music
played
to
me
whispered
the
rat
as
if
in
a
trance
here
in
this
holy
place
here
if
anywhere
surely
we
shall
find
him
then
suddenly
the
mole
felt
a
great
awe
fall
upon
him
an
awe
that
turned
his
muscles
to
water
bowed
his
head
and
rooted
his
feet
to
the
ground
it
was
no
panic
terror
indeed
he
felt
wonderfully
at
peace
and
happy
but
it
was
an
awe
that
smote
and
held
him
and
without
seeing
he
knew
it
could
only
mean
that
some
august
presence
was
very
very
near
with
difficulty
he
turned
to
look
for
his
friend
and
saw
him
at
his
side
cowed
stricken
and
trembling
violently
and
still
there
was
utter
silence
in
the
populous
branches
around
them
and
still
the
light
grew
and
grew
perhaps
he
would
never
have
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
but
that
though
the
piping
was
now
hushed
the
call
and
the
summons
seemed
still
dominant
and
imperious
he
might
not
refuse
were
death
himself
waiting
to
strike
him
instantly
once
he
had
looked
with
mortal
eye
on
things
rightly
kept
hidden
trembling
he
obeyed
and
raised
his
humble
head
and
then
in
that
utter
clearness
of
the
imminent
dawn
while
nature
flushed
with
fullness
of
incredible
colour
seemed
to
hold
her
breath
for
the
event
he
looked
in
the
very
eyes
of
the
friend
and
helper
saw
the
backward
sweep
of
the
curved
horns
gleaming
in
the
growing
daylight
saw
the
stern
hooked
nose
between
the
kindly
eyes
that
were
looking
down
on
them
humourously
while
the
bearded
mouth
broke
into
a
at
the
corners
saw
the
rippling
muscles
on
the
arm
that
lay
across
the
broad
chest
the
long
supple
hand
still
holding
the
only
just
fallen
away
from
the
parted
lips
saw
the
splendid
curves
of
the
shaggy
limbs
disposed
in
majestic
ease
on
the
sward
saw
last
of
all
nestling
between
his
very
hooves
sleeping
soundly
in
entire
peace
and
contentment
the
little
round
podgy
childish
form
of
the
baby
otter
all
this
he
saw
for
one
moment
breathless
and
intense
vivid
on
the
morning
sky
and
still
as
he
looked
he
lived
and
still
as
he
lived
he
wondered
rat
he
found
breath
to
whisper
shaking
are
you
afraid
afraid
murmured
the
rat
his
eyes
shining
with
unutterable
love
afraid
of
him
o
never
never
and
yet
and
yet
o
mole
i
am
afraid
then
the
two
animals
crouching
to
the
earth
bowed
their
heads
and
did
worship
sudden
and
magnificent
the
sun
s
broad
golden
disc
showed
itself
over
the
horizon
facing
them
and
the
first
rays
shooting
across
the
level
took
the
animals
full
in
the
eyes
and
dazzled
them
when
they
were
able
to
look
once
more
the
vision
had
vanished
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
carol
of
birds
that
hailed
the
dawn
as
they
stared
blankly
in
dumb
misery
deepening
as
they
slowly
realised
all
they
had
seen
and
all
they
had
lost
a
capricious
little
breeze
dancing
up
from
the
surface
of
the
water
tossed
the
aspens
shook
the
dewy
roses
and
blew
lightly
and
caressingly
in
their
faces
and
with
its
soft
touch
came
instant
oblivion
for
this
is
the
last
best
gift
that
the
kindly
is
careful
to
bestow
on
those
to
whom
he
has
revealed
himself
in
their
helping
the
gift
of
forgetfulness
lest
the
awful
remembrance
should
remain
and
grow
and
overshadow
mirth
and
pleasure
and
the
great
haunting
memory
should
spoil
all
the
of
little
animals
helped
out
of
difficulties
in
order
that
they
should
be
happy
and
lighthearted
as
before
mole
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
at
rat
who
was
looking
about
him
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
way
i
beg
your
pardon
what
did
you
say
rat
he
asked
i
think
i
was
only
remarking
said
rat
slowly
that
this
was
the
right
sort
of
place
and
that
here
if
anywhere
we
should
find
him
and
look
why
there
he
is
the
little
fellow
and
with
a
cry
of
delight
he
ran
towards
the
slumbering
portly
but
mole
stood
still
a
moment
held
in
thought
as
one
wakened
suddenly
from
a
beautiful
dream
who
struggles
to
recall
it
and
can
nothing
but
a
dim
sense
of
the
beauty
of
it
the
beauty
till
that
too
fades
away
in
its
turn
and
the
dreamer
bitterly
accepts
the
hard
cold
waking
and
all
its
penalties
so
mole
after
struggling
with
his
memory
for
a
brief
space
shook
his
head
sadly
and
followed
the
rat
portly
woke
up
with
a
joyous
squeak
and
wriggled
with
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
his
father
s
friends
who
had
played
with
him
so
often
in
past
days
in
a
moment
however
his
face
grew
blank
and
he
fell
to
hunting
round
in
a
circle
with
pleading
whine
as
a
child
that
has
fallen
happily
asleep
in
its
nurse
s
arms
and
wakes
to
find
itself
alone
and
laid
in
a
strange
place
and
searches
corners
and
cupboards
and
runs
from
room
to
room
despair
growing
silently
in
its
heart
even
so
portly
searched
the
island
and
searched
dogged
and
unwearying
till
at
last
the
black
moment
came
for
giving
it
up
and
sitting
down
and
crying
bitterly
the
mole
ran
quickly
to
comfort
the
little
animal
but
rat
lingering
looked
long
and
doubtfully
at
certain
deep
in
the
sward
some
great
animal
has
been
here
he
murmured
slowly
and
thoughtfully
and
stood
musing
musing
his
mind
strangely
stirred
come
along
rat
called
the
mole
think
of
poor
otter
waiting
up
there
by
the
ford
portly
had
soon
been
comforted
by
the
promise
of
a
treat
a
jaunt
on
the
river
in
rat
s
real
boat
and
the
two
animals
conducted
him
to
the
water
s
side
placed
him
securely
between
them
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
paddled
off
down
the
backwater
the
sun
was
fully
up
by
now
and
hot
on
them
birds
sang
lustily
and
without
restraint
and
flowers
smiled
and
nodded
from
either
bank
but
somehow
so
thought
the
animals
with
less
of
richness
and
blaze
of
colour
than
they
seemed
to
remember
seeing
quite
recently
somewhere
they
wondered
where
the
main
river
reached
again
they
turned
the
boat
s
head
upstream
towards
the
point
where
they
knew
their
friend
was
keeping
his
lonely
vigil
as
they
drew
near
the
familiar
ford
the
mole
took
the
boat
in
to
the
bank
and
they
lifted
portly
out
and
set
him
on
his
legs
on
the
gave
him
his
marching
orders
and
a
friendly
farewell
pat
on
the
back
and
shoved
out
into
they
watched
the
little
animal
as
he
waddled
along
the
path
contentedly
and
with
importance
watched
him
till
they
saw
his
muzzle
suddenly
lift
and
his
waddle
break
into
a
clumsy
amble
as
he
quickened
his
pace
with
shrill
whines
and
wriggles
of
recognition
looking
up
the
river
they
could
see
otter
start
up
tense
and
rigid
from
out
of
the
shallows
where
he
crouched
in
dumb
patience
and
could
hear
his
amazed
and
joyous
bark
as
he
bounded
up
through
the
osiers
on
to
the
path
then
the
mole
with
a
strong
pull
on
one
oar
swung
the
boat
round
and
let
the
full
stream
bear
them
down
again
whither
it
would
their
quest
now
happily
ended
i
feel
strangely
tired
rat
said
the
mole
leaning
wearily
over
his
oars
as
the
boat
drifted
it
s
being
up
all
night
you
ll
say
perhaps
but
that
s
nothing
we
do
as
much
half
the
nights
of
the
week
at
this
time
of
the
year
no
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
through
something
very
exciting
and
rather
terrible
and
it
was
just
over
and
yet
nothing
particular
has
or
something
very
surprising
and
splendid
and
beautiful
murmured
the
rat
leaning
back
and
closing
his
eyes
i
feel
just
as
you
do
mole
simply
dead
tired
though
not
body
tired
it
s
lucky
we
ve
got
the
stream
with
us
to
take
us
home
isn
t
it
jolly
to
feel
the
sun
again
soaking
into
one
s
bones
and
hark
to
the
wind
playing
in
the
reeds
it
s
like
music
far
away
music
said
the
mole
nodding
drowsily
so
i
was
thinking
murmured
the
rat
dreamful
and
languid
the
lilting
sort
that
runs
on
without
a
stop
but
with
words
in
it
too
it
passes
into
words
and
out
of
them
again
i
catch
them
at
intervals
then
it
is
once
more
and
then
nothing
but
the
reeds
soft
thin
you
hear
better
than
i
said
the
mole
sadly
i
can
not
catch
the
let
me
try
and
give
you
them
said
the
rat
softly
his
eyes
still
closed
now
it
is
turning
into
words
again
faint
but
clear
lest
the
awe
should
dwell
and
turn
your
frolic
to
fret
you
shall
look
on
my
power
at
the
helping
hour
but
then
you
shall
forget
now
the
reeds
take
it
up
forget
forget
they
sigh
and
it
dies
away
in
a
rustle
and
a
whisper
then
the
voice
returns
lest
limbs
be
reddened
and
rent
i
spring
the
trap
that
is
set
as
i
loose
the
snare
you
may
glimpse
me
there
for
surely
you
shall
forget
row
nearer
mole
nearer
to
the
reeds
it
is
hard
to
catch
and
grows
each
minute
fainter
helper
and
healer
i
cheer
small
waifs
in
the
woodland
wet
strays
i
find
in
it
wounds
i
bind
in
it
bidding
them
all
forget
nearer
mole
nearer
no
it
is
no
good
the
song
has
died
away
into
but
what
do
the
words
mean
asked
the
wondering
mole
that
i
do
not
know
said
the
rat
simply
i
passed
them
on
to
you
as
they
reached
me
ah
now
they
return
again
and
this
time
full
and
clear
this
time
at
last
it
is
the
real
the
unmistakable
thing
simple
passionate
perfect
well
let
s
have
it
then
said
the
mole
after
he
had
waited
patiently
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
hot
sun
but
no
answer
came
he
looked
and
understood
the
silence
with
a
smile
of
much
happiness
on
his
face
and
something
of
a
listening
look
still
lingering
there
the
weary
rat
was
fast
asleep
viii
toad
s
adventures
when
toad
found
himself
immured
in
a
dank
and
noisome
dungeon
and
knew
that
all
the
grim
darkness
of
a
medieval
fortress
lay
between
him
and
the
outer
world
of
sunshine
and
high
roads
where
he
had
lately
been
so
happy
disporting
himself
as
if
he
had
bought
up
every
road
in
england
he
flung
himself
at
full
length
on
the
floor
and
shed
bitter
tears
and
abandoned
himself
to
dark
despair
this
is
the
end
of
everything
he
said
at
least
it
is
the
end
of
the
career
of
toad
which
is
the
same
thing
the
popular
and
handsome
toad
the
rich
and
hospitable
toad
the
toad
so
free
and
careless
and
debonair
how
can
i
hope
to
be
ever
set
at
large
again
he
said
who
have
been
imprisoned
so
justly
for
stealing
so
handsome
a
in
such
an
audacious
manner
and
for
such
lurid
and
imaginative
cheek
bestowed
upon
such
a
number
of
fat
policemen
here
his
sobs
choked
him
stupid
animal
that
i
was
he
said
now
i
must
languish
in
this
dungeon
till
people
who
were
proud
to
say
they
knew
me
have
forgotten
the
very
name
of
toad
o
wise
old
badger
he
said
o
clever
intelligent
rat
and
sensible
mole
what
sound
judgments
what
a
knowledge
of
men
and
matters
you
possess
o
unhappy
and
forsaken
toad
with
lamentations
such
as
these
he
passed
his
days
and
nights
for
several
weeks
refusing
his
meals
or
intermediate
light
refreshments
though
the
grim
and
ancient
gaoler
knowing
that
toad
s
pockets
were
well
lined
frequently
pointed
out
that
many
comforts
and
indeed
luxuries
could
by
arrangement
be
sent
in
at
a
price
from
outside
now
the
gaoler
had
a
daughter
a
pleasant
wench
and
who
assisted
her
father
in
the
lighter
duties
of
his
post
she
was
particularly
fond
of
animals
and
besides
her
canary
whose
cage
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
massive
wall
of
the
keep
by
day
to
the
great
annoyance
of
prisoners
who
relished
an
nap
and
was
shrouded
in
an
antimacassar
on
the
parlour
table
at
night
she
kept
several
piebald
mice
and
a
restless
revolving
squirrel
this
girl
pitying
the
misery
of
toad
said
to
her
father
one
day
father
i
can
t
bear
to
see
that
poor
beast
so
unhappy
and
getting
so
thin
you
let
me
have
the
managing
of
him
you
know
how
fond
of
animals
i
am
i
ll
make
him
eat
from
my
hand
and
sit
up
and
do
all
sorts
of
her
father
replied
that
she
could
do
what
she
liked
with
him
he
was
tired
of
toad
and
his
sulks
and
his
airs
and
his
meanness
so
that
day
she
went
on
her
errand
of
mercy
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
toad
s
cell
now
cheer
up
toad
she
said
coaxingly
on
entering
and
sit
up
and
dry
your
eyes
and
be
a
sensible
animal
and
do
try
and
eat
a
bit
of
dinner
see
i
ve
brought
you
some
of
mine
hot
from
the
oven
it
was
between
two
plates
and
its
fragrance
filled
the
narrow
cell
the
penetrating
smell
of
cabbage
reached
the
nose
of
toad
as
he
lay
prostrate
in
his
misery
on
the
floor
and
gave
him
the
idea
for
a
moment
that
perhaps
life
was
not
such
a
blank
and
desperate
thing
as
he
had
imagined
but
still
he
wailed
and
kicked
with
his
legs
and
refused
to
be
comforted
so
the
wise
girl
retired
for
the
time
but
of
course
a
good
deal
of
the
smell
of
hot
cabbage
remained
behind
as
it
will
do
and
toad
between
his
sobs
sniffed
and
reflected
and
gradually
began
to
think
new
and
inspiring
thoughts
of
chivalry
and
poetry
and
deeds
still
to
be
done
of
broad
meadows
and
cattle
browsing
in
them
raked
by
sun
and
wind
of
and
straight
and
warm
beset
by
bees
and
of
the
comforting
clink
of
dishes
set
down
on
the
table
at
toad
hall
and
the
scrape
of
on
the
floor
as
every
one
pulled
himself
close
up
to
his
work
the
air
of
the
narrow
cell
took
a
rosy
tinge
he
began
to
think
of
his
friends
and
how
they
would
surely
be
able
to
do
something
of
lawyers
and
how
they
would
have
enjoyed
his
case
and
what
an
ass
he
had
been
not
to
get
in
a
few
and
lastly
he
thought
of
his
own
great
cleverness
and
resource
and
all
that
he
was
capable
of
if
he
only
gave
his
great
mind
to
it
and
the
cure
was
almost
complete
when
the
girl
returned
some
hours
later
she
carried
a
tray
with
a
cup
of
fragrant
tea
steaming
on
it
and
a
plate
piled
up
with
very
hot
buttered
toast
cut
thick
very
brown
on
both
sides
with
the
butter
running
through
the
holes
in
it
in
great
golden
drops
like
honey
from
the
honeycomb
the
smell
of
that
buttered
toast
simply
talked
to
toad
and
with
no
uncertain
voice
talked
of
warm
kitchens
of
breakfasts
on
bright
frosty
mornings
of
cosy
parlour
firesides
on
winter
evenings
when
one
s
ramble
was
over
and
slippered
feet
were
propped
on
the
fender
of
the
purring
of
contented
cats
and
the
twitter
of
sleepy
canaries
toad
sat
up
on
end
once
more
dried
his
eyes
sipped
his
tea
and
munched
his
toast
and
soon
began
talking
freely
about
himself
and
the
house
he
lived
in
and
his
doings
there
and
how
important
he
was
and
what
a
lot
his
friends
thought
of
him
the
gaoler
s
daughter
saw
that
the
topic
was
doing
him
as
much
good
as
the
tea
as
indeed
it
was
and
encouraged
him
to
go
on
tell
me
about
toad
hall
said
she
it
sounds
toad
hall
said
the
toad
proudly
is
an
eligible
gentleman
s
residence
very
unique
dating
in
part
from
the
fourteenth
century
but
replete
with
every
modern
convenience
sanitation
five
minutes
from
church
and
suitable
for
bless
the
animal
said
the
girl
laughing
i
don
t
want
to
take
it
tell
me
something
real
about
it
but
first
wait
till
i
fetch
you
some
more
tea
and
she
tripped
away
and
presently
returned
with
a
fresh
trayful
and
toad
pitching
into
the
toast
with
avidity
his
spirits
quite
restored
to
their
usual
level
told
her
about
the
boathouse
and
the
and
the
old
walled
and
about
the
and
the
stables
and
the
and
the
and
about
the
dairy
and
the
and
the
and
the
she
liked
that
bit
especially
and
about
the
and
the
fun
they
had
there
when
the
other
animals
were
gathered
round
the
table
and
toad
was
at
his
best
singing
songs
telling
stories
carrying
on
generally
then
she
wanted
to
know
about
his
and
was
very
interested
in
all
he
had
to
tell
her
about
them
and
how
they
lived
and
what
they
did
to
pass
their
time
of
course
she
did
not
say
she
was
fond
of
animals
as
pets
because
she
had
the
sense
to
see
that
toad
would
be
extremely
offended
when
she
said
good
night
having
filled
his
and
shaken
up
his
straw
for
him
toad
was
very
much
the
same
sanguine
animal
that
he
had
been
of
old
he
sang
a
little
song
or
two
of
the
sort
he
used
to
sing
at
his
curled
himself
up
in
the
straw
and
had
an
excellent
night
s
rest
and
the
pleasantest
of
dreams
they
had
many
interesting
talks
together
after
that
as
the
dreary
days
went
on
and
the
gaoler
s
daughter
grew
very
sorry
for
toad
and
thought
it
a
great
shame
that
a
poor
little
animal
should
be
locked
up
in
prison
for
what
seemed
to
her
a
very
trivial
offence
toad
of
course
in
his
vanity
thought
that
her
interest
in
him
proceeded
from
a
growing
tenderness
and
he
could
not
help
that
the
social
gulf
between
them
was
so
very
wide
for
she
was
a
comely
lass
and
evidently
admired
him
very
much
one
morning
the
girl
was
very
thoughtful
and
answered
at
random
and
did
not
seem
to
toad
to
be
paying
proper
attention
to
his
witty
sayings
and
sparkling
comments
toad
she
said
presently
just
listen
please
i
have
an
aunt
who
is
a
there
there
said
toad
graciously
and
affably
never
mind
think
no
more
about
it
have
several
aunts
who
ought
to
be
do
be
quiet
a
minute
toad
said
the
girl
you
talk
too
much
that
s
your
chief
fault
and
i
m
trying
to
think
and
you
hurt
my
head
as
i
said
i
have
an
aunt
who
is
a
washerwoman
she
does
the
washing
for
all
the
prisoners
in
this
castle
we
try
to
keep
any
paying
business
of
that
sort
in
the
family
you
understand
she
takes
out
the
washing
on
monday
morning
and
brings
it
in
on
friday
evening
this
is
a
thursday
now
this
is
what
occurs
to
me
you
re
very
rich
at
least
you
re
always
telling
me
so
and
she
s
very
poor
a
few
pounds
wouldn
t
make
any
difference
to
you
and
it
would
mean
a
lot
to
her
now
i
think
if
she
were
properly
approached
squared
i
believe
is
the
word
you
animals
use
you
could
come
to
some
arrangement
by
which
she
would
let
you
have
her
dress
and
bonnet
and
so
on
and
you
could
escape
from
the
castle
as
the
official
washerwoman
you
re
very
alike
in
many
respects
particularly
about
the
we
re
not
said
the
toad
in
a
huff
i
have
a
very
elegant
figure
for
what
i
so
has
my
aunt
replied
the
girl
for
what
she
is
but
have
it
your
own
way
you
horrid
proud
ungrateful
animal
when
i
m
sorry
for
you
and
trying
to
help
you
yes
yes
that
s
all
right
thank
you
very
much
indeed
said
the
toad
hurriedly
but
look
here
you
wouldn
t
surely
have
toad
of
toad
hall
going
about
the
country
disguised
as
a
washerwoman
then
you
can
stop
here
as
a
toad
replied
the
girl
with
much
spirit
i
suppose
you
want
to
go
off
in
a
honest
toad
was
always
ready
to
admit
himself
in
the
wrong
you
are
a
good
kind
clever
girl
he
said
and
i
am
indeed
a
proud
and
a
stupid
toad
introduce
me
to
your
worthy
aunt
if
you
will
be
so
kind
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
excellent
lady
and
i
will
be
able
to
arrange
terms
satisfactory
to
both
next
evening
the
girl
ushered
her
aunt
into
toad
s
cell
bearing
his
week
s
washing
pinned
up
in
a
towel
the
old
lady
had
been
prepared
beforehand
for
the
interview
and
the
sight
of
certain
gold
sovereigns
that
toad
had
thoughtfully
placed
on
the
table
in
full
view
practically
completed
the
matter
and
left
little
further
to
discuss
in
return
for
his
cash
toad
received
a
cotton
print
gown
an
apron
a
shawl
and
a
rusty
black
bonnet
the
only
stipulation
the
old
lady
made
being
that
she
should
be
gagged
and
bound
and
dumped
down
in
a
corner
by
this
not
very
convincing
artifice
she
explained
aided
by
picturesque
fiction
which
she
could
supply
herself
she
hoped
to
retain
her
situation
in
spite
of
the
suspicious
appearance
of
things
toad
was
delighted
with
the
suggestion
it
would
enable
him
to
leave
the
prison
in
some
style
and
with
his
reputation
for
being
a
desperate
and
dangerous
fellow
untarnished
and
he
readily
helped
the
gaoler
s
daughter
to
make
her
aunt
appear
as
much
as
possible
the
victim
of
circumstances
over
which
she
had
no
control
now
it
s
your
turn
toad
said
the
girl
take
off
that
coat
and
waistcoat
of
yours
you
re
fat
enough
as
it
shaking
with
laughter
she
proceeded
to
him
into
the
cotton
print
gown
arranged
the
shawl
with
a
professional
fold
and
tied
the
strings
of
the
rusty
bonnet
under
his
chin
you
re
the
very
image
of
her
she
giggled
only
i
m
sure
you
never
looked
half
so
respectable
in
all
your
life
before
now
toad
and
good
luck
go
straight
down
the
way
you
came
up
and
if
any
one
says
anything
to
you
as
they
probably
will
being
but
men
you
can
chaff
back
a
bit
of
course
but
remember
you
re
a
widow
woman
quite
alone
in
the
world
with
a
character
to
with
a
quaking
heart
but
as
firm
a
footstep
as
he
could
command
toad
set
forth
cautiously
on
what
seemed
to
be
a
most
and
hazardous
undertaking
but
he
was
soon
agreeably
surprised
to
find
how
easy
everything
was
made
for
him
and
a
little
humbled
at
the
thought
that
both
his
popularity
and
the
sex
that
seemed
to
inspire
it
were
really
another
s
the
washerwoman
s
squat
figure
in
its
familiar
cotton
print
seemed
a
passport
for
every
barred
door
and
grim
gateway
even
when
he
hesitated
uncertain
as
to
the
right
turning
to
take
he
found
himself
helped
out
of
his
difficulty
by
the
warder
at
the
next
gate
anxious
to
be
off
to
his
tea
summoning
him
to
come
along
sharp
and
not
keep
him
waiting
there
all
night
the
chaff
and
the
humourous
sallies
to
which
he
was
subjected
and
to
which
of
course
he
had
to
provide
prompt
and
effective
reply
formed
indeed
his
chief
danger
for
toad
was
an
animal
with
a
strong
sense
of
his
own
dignity
and
the
chaff
was
mostly
he
thought
poor
and
clumsy
and
the
humour
of
the
sallies
entirely
lacking
however
he
kept
his
temper
though
with
great
difficulty
suited
his
retorts
to
his
company
and
his
supposed
character
and
did
his
best
not
to
overstep
the
limits
of
good
taste
it
seemed
hours
before
he
crossed
the
last
courtyard
rejected
the
pressing
invitations
from
the
last
guardroom
and
dodged
the
outspread
arms
of
the
last
warder
pleading
with
simulated
passion
for
just
one
farewell
embrace
but
at
last
he
heard
the
in
the
great
outer
door
click
behind
him
felt
the
fresh
air
of
the
outer
world
upon
his
anxious
brow
and
knew
that
he
was
free
dizzy
with
the
easy
success
of
his
daring
exploit
he
walked
quickly
towards
the
lights
of
the
town
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
he
should
do
next
only
quite
certain
of
one
thing
that
he
must
remove
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
neighbourhood
where
the
lady
he
was
forced
to
represent
was
so
and
so
popular
a
character
as
he
walked
along
considering
his
attention
was
caught
by
some
red
and
green
lights
a
little
way
off
to
one
side
of
the
town
and
the
sound
of
the
puffing
and
snorting
of
engines
and
the
banging
of
shunted
trucks
fell
on
his
ear
aha
he
thought
this
is
a
piece
of
luck
a
railway
station
is
the
thing
i
want
most
in
the
whole
world
at
this
moment
and
what
s
more
i
needn
t
go
through
the
town
to
get
it
and
shan
t
have
to
support
this
humiliating
character
by
repartees
which
though
thoroughly
effective
do
not
assist
one
s
sense
of
he
made
his
way
to
the
station
accordingly
consulted
a
and
found
that
a
train
bound
more
or
less
in
the
direction
of
his
home
was
due
to
start
in
more
luck
said
toad
his
spirits
rising
rapidly
and
went
off
to
the
to
buy
his
ticket
he
gave
the
name
of
the
station
that
he
knew
to
be
nearest
to
the
village
of
which
toad
hall
was
the
principal
feature
and
mechanically
put
his
fingers
in
search
of
the
necessary
money
where
his
waistcoat
pocket
should
have
been
but
here
the
cotton
gown
which
had
nobly
stood
by
him
so
far
and
which
he
had
basely
forgotten
intervened
and
frustrated
his
efforts
in
a
sort
of
nightmare
he
struggled
with
the
strange
uncanny
thing
that
seemed
to
hold
his
hands
turn
all
muscular
strivings
to
water
and
laugh
at
him
all
the
time
while
other
travellers
forming
up
in
a
line
behind
waited
with
impatience
making
suggestions
of
more
or
less
value
and
comments
of
more
or
less
stringency
and
point
at
last
somehow
he
never
rightly
understood
how
he
burst
the
barriers
attained
the
goal
arrived
at
where
all
waistcoat
pockets
are
eternally
situated
and
found
not
only
no
money
but
no
pocket
to
hold
it
and
no
waistcoat
to
hold
the
pocket
to
his
horror
he
recollected
that
he
had
left
both
coat
and
waistcoat
behind
him
in
his
cell
and
with
them
his
money
keys
watch
matches
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
all
that
distinguishes
the
animal
the
lord
of
creation
from
the
inferior
or
productions
that
hop
or
trip
about
permissively
unequipped
for
the
real
contest
in
his
misery
he
made
one
desperate
effort
to
carry
the
thing
off
and
with
a
return
to
his
fine
old
manner
a
blend
of
the
squire
and
the
college
don
he
said
look
here
i
find
i
ve
left
my
purse
behind
just
give
me
that
ticket
will
you
and
i
ll
send
the
money
on
i
m
in
these
the
clerk
stared
at
him
and
the
rusty
black
bonnet
a
moment
and
then
laughed
i
should
think
you
were
pretty
well
known
in
these
parts
he
said
if
you
ve
tried
this
game
on
often
here
stand
away
from
the
window
please
madam
you
re
obstructing
the
other
passengers
an
old
gentleman
who
had
been
prodding
him
in
the
back
for
some
moments
here
thrust
him
away
and
what
was
worse
addressed
him
as
his
good
woman
which
angered
toad
more
than
anything
that
had
occurred
that
evening
baffled
and
full
of
despair
he
wandered
blindly
down
the
platform
where
the
train
was
standing
and
tears
trickled
down
each
side
of
his
nose
it
was
hard
he
thought
to
be
within
sight
of
safety
and
almost
of
home
and
to
be
baulked
by
the
want
of
a
few
wretched
shillings
and
by
the
pettifogging
mistrustfulness
of
paid
officials
very
soon
his
escape
would
be
discovered
the
hunt
would
be
up
he
would
be
caught
reviled
loaded
with
chains
dragged
back
again
to
prison
and
and
straw
his
guards
and
penalties
would
be
doubled
and
o
what
sarcastic
remarks
the
girl
would
make
what
was
to
be
done
he
was
not
swift
of
foot
his
figure
was
unfortunately
recognisable
could
he
not
squeeze
under
the
seat
of
a
carriage
he
had
seen
this
method
adopted
by
schoolboys
when
the
provided
by
thoughtful
parents
had
been
diverted
to
other
and
better
ends
as
he
pondered
he
found
himself
opposite
the
engine
which
was
being
oiled
wiped
and
generally
caressed
by
its
affectionate
driver
a
burly
man
with
an
in
one
hand
and
a
lump
of
in
the
other
hullo
mother
said
the
what
s
the
trouble
you
don
t
look
particularly
o
sir
said
toad
crying
afresh
i
am
a
poor
unhappy
washerwoman
and
i
ve
lost
all
my
money
and
can
t
pay
for
a
ticket
and
i
must
get
home
somehow
and
whatever
i
am
to
do
i
don
t
know
o
dear
o
dear
that
s
a
bad
business
indeed
said
the
reflectively
lost
your
money
and
can
t
get
home
and
got
some
kids
too
waiting
for
you
i
dare
say
any
amount
of
em
sobbed
toad
and
they
ll
be
hungry
and
playing
with
matches
and
upsetting
lamps
the
little
innocents
and
quarrelling
and
going
on
generally
o
dear
o
dear
well
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
said
the
good
you
re
a
washerwoman
to
your
trade
says
you
very
well
that
s
that
and
i
m
an
as
you
well
may
see
and
there
s
no
denying
it
s
terribly
dirty
work
uses
up
a
power
of
shirts
it
does
till
my
missus
is
fair
tired
of
washing
of
em
if
you
ll
wash
a
few
shirts
for
me
when
you
get
home
and
send
em
along
i
ll
give
you
a
ride
on
my
engine
it
s
against
the
company
s
regulations
but
we
re
not
so
very
particular
in
these
the
toad
s
misery
turned
into
rapture
as
he
eagerly
scrambled
up
into
the
cab
of
the
engine
of
course
he
had
never
washed
a
shirt
in
his
life
and
couldn
t
if
he
tried
and
anyhow
he
wasn
t
going
to
begin
but
he
thought
when
i
get
safely
home
to
toad
hall
and
have
money
again
and
pockets
to
put
it
in
i
will
send
the
enough
to
pay
for
quite
a
quantity
of
washing
and
that
will
be
the
same
thing
or
the
guard
waved
his
welcome
flag
the
whistled
in
cheerful
response
and
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
as
the
speed
increased
and
the
toad
could
see
on
either
side
of
him
real
fields
and
trees
and
hedges
and
cows
and
horses
all
flying
past
him
and
as
he
thought
how
every
minute
was
bringing
him
nearer
to
toad
hall
and
sympathetic
friends
and
money
to
chink
in
his
pocket
and
a
soft
bed
to
sleep
in
and
good
things
to
eat
and
praise
and
admiration
at
the
recital
of
his
adventures
and
his
surpassing
cleverness
he
began
to
skip
up
and
down
and
shout
and
sing
snatches
of
song
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
who
had
come
across
washerwomen
before
at
long
intervals
but
never
one
at
all
like
this
they
had
covered
many
and
many
a
mile
and
toad
was
already
considering
what
he
would
have
for
supper
as
soon
as
he
got
home
when
he
noticed
that
the
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
was
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
engine
and
listening
hard
then
he
saw
him
climb
on
to
the
coals
and
gaze
out
over
the
top
of
the
train
then
he
returned
and
said
to
toad
it
s
very
strange
we
re
the
last
train
running
in
this
direction
yet
i
could
be
sworn
that
i
heard
another
following
us
toad
ceased
his
frivolous
antics
at
once
he
became
grave
and
depressed
and
a
dull
pain
in
the
lower
part
of
his
spine
communicating
itself
to
his
legs
made
him
want
to
sit
down
and
try
desperately
not
to
think
of
all
the
possibilities
by
this
time
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
and
the
steadying
himself
on
the
coal
could
command
a
view
of
the
line
behind
them
for
a
long
distance
presently
he
called
out
i
can
see
it
clearly
now
it
is
an
engine
on
our
rails
coming
along
at
a
great
pace
it
looks
as
if
we
were
being
pursued
the
miserable
toad
crouching
in
the
tried
hard
to
think
of
something
to
do
with
dismal
want
of
success
they
are
gaining
on
us
fast
cried
the
and
the
engine
is
crowded
with
the
queerest
lot
of
people
men
like
ancient
warders
waving
halberds
policemen
in
their
helmets
waving
truncheons
and
shabbily
dressed
men
in
obvious
and
unmistakable
detectives
even
at
this
distance
waving
revolvers
and
all
waving
and
all
shouting
the
same
thing
stop
stop
stop
then
toad
fell
on
his
knees
among
the
coals
and
raising
his
clasped
paws
in
supplication
cried
save
me
only
save
me
dear
kind
and
i
will
confess
everything
i
am
not
the
simple
washerwoman
i
seem
to
be
i
have
no
children
waiting
for
me
innocent
or
otherwise
i
am
a
toad
the
and
popular
toad
a
landed
proprietor
i
have
just
escaped
by
my
great
daring
and
cleverness
from
a
loathsome
dungeon
into
which
my
enemies
had
flung
me
and
if
those
fellows
on
that
engine
recapture
me
it
will
be
chains
and
and
straw
and
misery
once
more
for
poor
unhappy
innocent
toad
the
looked
down
upon
him
very
sternly
and
said
now
tell
the
truth
what
were
you
put
in
prison
for
it
was
nothing
very
much
said
poor
toad
colouring
deeply
i
only
borrowed
a
motorcar
while
the
owners
were
at
lunch
they
had
no
need
of
it
at
the
time
i
didn
t
mean
to
steal
it
really
but
people
especially
magistrates
take
such
harsh
views
of
thoughtless
and
the
looked
very
grave
and
said
i
fear
that
you
have
been
indeed
a
wicked
toad
and
by
rights
i
ought
to
give
you
up
to
offended
justice
but
you
are
evidently
in
sore
trouble
and
distress
so
i
will
not
desert
you
i
don
t
hold
with
for
one
thing
and
i
don
t
hold
with
being
ordered
about
by
policemen
when
i
m
on
my
own
engine
for
another
and
the
sight
of
an
animal
in
tears
always
makes
me
feel
queer
and
softhearted
so
cheer
up
toad
i
ll
do
my
best
and
we
may
beat
them
yet
they
piled
on
more
coals
shovelling
furiously
the
furnace
roared
the
sparks
flew
the
engine
leapt
and
swung
but
still
their
pursuers
slowly
gained
the
with
a
sigh
wiped
his
brow
with
a
handful
of
and
said
i
m
afraid
it
s
no
good
toad
you
see
they
are
running
light
and
they
have
the
better
engine
there
s
just
one
thing
left
for
us
to
do
and
it
s
your
only
chance
so
attend
very
carefully
to
what
i
tell
you
a
short
way
ahead
of
us
is
a
long
tunnel
and
on
the
other
side
of
that
the
line
passes
through
a
thick
wood
now
i
will
put
on
all
the
speed
i
can
while
we
are
running
through
the
tunnel
but
the
other
fellows
will
slow
down
a
bit
naturally
for
fear
of
an
accident
when
we
are
through
i
will
shut
off
steam
and
put
on
brakes
as
hard
as
i
can
and
the
moment
it
s
safe
to
do
so
you
must
jump
and
hide
in
the
wood
before
they
get
through
the
tunnel
and
see
you
then
i
will
go
full
speed
ahead
again
and
they
can
chase
me
if
they
like
for
as
long
as
they
like
and
as
far
as
they
like
now
mind
and
be
ready
to
jump
when
i
tell
you
they
piled
on
more
coals
and
the
train
shot
into
the
tunnel
and
the
engine
rushed
and
roared
and
rattled
till
at
last
they
shot
out
at
the
other
end
into
fresh
air
and
the
peaceful
moonlight
and
saw
the
wood
lying
dark
and
helpful
upon
either
side
of
the
line
the
driver
shut
off
steam
and
put
on
brakes
the
toad
got
down
on
the
step
and
as
the
train
slowed
down
to
almost
a
walking
pace
he
heard
the
driver
call
out
now
jump
toad
jumped
rolled
down
a
short
embankment
picked
himself
up
unhurt
scrambled
into
the
wood
and
hid
peeping
out
he
saw
his
train
get
up
speed
again
and
disappear
at
a
great
pace
then
out
of
the
tunnel
burst
the
pursuing
engine
roaring
and
whistling
her
motley
crew
waving
their
various
weapons
and
shouting
stop
stop
stop
when
they
were
past
the
toad
had
a
hearty
laugh
for
the
first
time
since
he
was
thrown
into
prison
but
he
soon
stopped
laughing
when
he
came
to
consider
that
it
was
now
very
late
and
dark
and
cold
and
he
was
in
an
unknown
wood
with
no
money
and
no
chance
of
supper
and
still
far
from
friends
and
home
and
the
dead
silence
of
everything
after
the
roar
and
rattle
of
the
train
was
something
of
a
shock
he
dared
not
leave
the
shelter
of
the
trees
so
he
struck
into
the
wood
with
the
idea
of
leaving
the
railway
as
far
as
possible
behind
him
after
so
many
weeks
within
walls
he
found
the
wood
strange
and
unfriendly
and
inclined
he
thought
to
make
fun
of
him
sounding
their
mechanical
rattle
made
him
think
that
the
wood
was
full
of
searching
warders
closing
in
on
him
an
owl
swooping
noiselessly
towards
him
brushed
his
shoulder
with
its
wing
making
him
jump
with
the
horrid
certainty
that
it
was
a
hand
then
flitted
off
laughing
its
low
ho
ho
ho
which
toad
thought
in
very
poor
taste
once
he
met
a
fox
who
stopped
looked
him
up
and
down
in
a
sarcastic
sort
of
way
and
said
hullo
washerwoman
half
a
pair
of
socks
and
a
short
this
week
mind
it
doesn
t
occur
again
and
swaggered
off
sniggering
toad
looked
about
for
a
stone
to
throw
at
him
but
could
not
succeed
in
finding
one
which
vexed
him
more
than
anything
at
last
cold
hungry
and
tired
out
he
sought
the
shelter
of
a
hollow
tree
where
with
branches
and
dead
leaves
he
made
himself
as
comfortable
a
bed
as
he
could
and
slept
soundly
till
the
morning
ix
wayfarers
all
the
water
rat
was
restless
and
he
did
not
exactly
know
why
to
all
appearance
the
summer
s
pomp
was
still
at
fullest
height
and
although
in
the
tilled
acres
green
had
given
way
to
gold
though
rowans
were
reddening
and
the
woods
were
dashed
here
and
there
with
a
tawny
fierceness
yet
light
and
warmth
and
colour
were
still
present
in
undiminished
measure
clean
of
any
chilly
premonitions
of
the
passing
year
but
the
constant
chorus
of
the
orchards
and
hedges
had
shrunk
to
a
casual
evensong
from
a
few
yet
unwearied
performers
the
robin
was
beginning
to
assert
himself
once
more
and
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
air
of
change
and
departure
the
cuckoo
of
course
had
long
been
silent
but
many
another
feathered
friend
for
months
a
part
of
the
familiar
landscape
and
its
small
society
was
missing
too
and
it
seemed
that
the
ranks
thinned
steadily
day
by
day
rat
ever
observant
of
all
winged
movement
saw
that
it
was
taking
daily
a
southing
tendency
and
even
as
he
lay
in
bed
at
night
he
thought
he
could
make
out
passing
in
the
darkness
overhead
the
beat
and
quiver
of
impatient
pinions
obedient
to
the
peremptory
call
nature
s
grand
hotel
has
its
season
like
the
others
as
the
guests
one
by
one
pack
pay
and
depart
and
the
seats
at
the
hote
shrink
pitifully
at
each
succeeding
meal
as
suites
of
rooms
are
closed
carpets
taken
up
and
waiters
sent
away
those
boarders
who
are
staying
on
en
pension
until
the
next
year
s
full
can
not
help
being
somewhat
affected
by
all
these
flittings
and
farewells
this
eager
discussion
of
plans
routes
and
fresh
quarters
this
daily
shrinkage
in
the
stream
of
comradeship
one
gets
unsettled
depressed
and
inclined
to
be
querulous
why
this
craving
for
change
why
not
stay
on
quietly
here
like
us
and
be
jolly
you
don
t
know
this
hotel
out
of
the
season
and
what
fun
we
have
among
ourselves
we
fellows
who
remain
and
see
the
whole
interesting
year
out
all
very
true
no
doubt
the
others
always
reply
we
quite
envy
you
and
some
other
year
perhaps
but
just
now
we
have
engagements
and
there
s
the
bus
at
the
door
our
time
is
up
so
they
depart
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
and
we
miss
them
and
feel
resentful
the
rat
was
a
sort
of
animal
rooted
to
the
land
and
whoever
went
he
stayed
still
he
could
not
help
noticing
what
was
in
the
air
and
feeling
some
of
its
influence
in
his
bones
it
was
difficult
to
settle
down
to
anything
seriously
with
all
this
flitting
going
on
leaving
the
where
rushes
stood
thick
and
tall
in
a
stream
that
was
becoming
sluggish
and
low
he
wandered
crossed
a
field
or
two
of
pasturage
already
looking
dusty
and
parched
and
thrust
into
the
great
sea
of
wheat
yellow
wavy
and
murmurous
full
of
quiet
motion
and
small
whisperings
here
he
often
loved
to
wander
through
the
forest
of
stiff
strong
stalks
that
carried
their
own
golden
sky
away
over
his
head
a
sky
that
was
always
dancing
shimmering
softly
talking
or
swaying
strongly
to
the
passing
wind
and
recovering
itself
with
a
toss
and
a
merry
laugh
here
too
he
had
many
small
friends
a
society
complete
in
itself
leading
full
and
busy
lives
but
always
with
a
spare
moment
to
gossip
and
exchange
news
with
a
visitor
today
however
though
they
were
civil
enough
the
and
seemed
preoccupied
many
were
digging
and
tunnelling
busily
others
gathered
together
in
small
groups
examined
plans
and
drawings
of
small
flats
stated
to
be
desirable
and
compact
and
situated
conveniently
near
the
stores
some
were
hauling
out
dusty
trunks
and
others
were
already
packing
their
belongings
while
everywhere
piles
and
bundles
of
wheat
oats
barley
and
nuts
lay
about
ready
for
transport
here
s
old
ratty
they
cried
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
come
and
bear
a
hand
rat
and
don
t
stand
about
idle
what
sort
of
games
are
you
up
to
said
the
water
rat
severely
you
know
it
isn
t
time
to
be
thinking
of
winter
quarters
yet
by
a
long
way
o
yes
we
know
that
explained
a
rather
shamefacedly
but
it
s
always
as
well
to
be
in
good
time
isn
t
it
we
really
must
get
all
the
furniture
and
baggage
and
stores
moved
out
of
this
before
those
horrid
machines
begin
clicking
round
the
fields
and
then
you
know
the
best
flats
get
picked
up
so
quickly
nowadays
and
if
you
re
late
you
have
to
put
up
with
anything
and
they
want
such
a
lot
of
doing
up
too
before
they
re
fit
to
move
into
of
course
we
re
early
we
know
that
but
we
re
only
just
making
a
o
bother
starts
said
the
rat
it
s
a
splendid
day
come
for
a
row
or
a
stroll
along
the
hedges
or
a
picnic
in
the
woods
or
well
i
think
not
thank
you
replied
the
hurriedly
perhaps
some
other
day
when
we
ve
more
time
the
rat
with
a
snort
of
contempt
swung
round
to
go
tripped
over
a
and
fell
with
undignified
remarks
if
people
would
be
more
careful
said
a
rather
stiffly
and
look
where
they
re
going
people
wouldn
t
hurt
themselves
and
forget
themselves
mind
that
rat
you
d
better
sit
down
somewhere
in
an
hour
or
two
we
may
be
more
free
to
attend
to
you
won
t
be
free
as
you
call
it
much
this
side
of
christmas
i
can
see
that
retorted
the
rat
grumpily
as
he
picked
his
way
out
of
the
field
he
returned
somewhat
despondently
to
his
river
again
his
faithful
old
river
which
never
packed
up
flitted
or
went
into
winter
quarters
in
the
osiers
which
fringed
the
bank
he
spied
a
swallow
sitting
presently
it
was
joined
by
another
and
then
by
a
third
and
the
birds
fidgeting
restlessly
on
their
bough
talked
together
earnestly
and
low
what
already
said
the
rat
strolling
up
to
them
what
s
the
hurry
i
call
it
simply
o
we
re
not
off
yet
if
that
s
what
you
mean
replied
the
first
swallow
we
re
only
making
plans
and
arranging
things
talking
it
over
you
know
what
route
we
re
taking
this
year
and
where
we
ll
stop
and
so
on
that
s
half
the
fun
fun
said
the
rat
now
that
s
just
what
i
don
t
understand
if
you
ve
got
to
leave
this
pleasant
place
and
your
friends
who
will
miss
you
and
your
snug
homes
that
you
ve
just
settled
into
why
when
the
hour
strikes
i
ve
no
doubt
you
ll
go
bravely
and
face
all
the
trouble
and
discomfort
and
change
and
newness
and
make
believe
that
you
re
not
very
unhappy
but
to
want
to
talk
about
it
or
even
think
about
it
till
you
really
need
no
you
don
t
understand
naturally
said
the
second
swallow
first
we
feel
it
stirring
within
us
a
sweet
unrest
then
back
come
the
recollections
one
by
one
like
homing
pigeons
they
flutter
through
our
dreams
at
night
they
fly
with
us
in
our
wheelings
and
circlings
by
day
we
hunger
to
inquire
of
each
other
to
compare
notes
and
assure
ourselves
that
it
was
all
really
true
as
one
by
one
the
scents
and
sounds
and
names
of
places
come
gradually
back
and
beckon
to
couldn
t
you
stop
on
for
just
this
year
suggested
the
water
rat
wistfully
we
ll
all
do
our
best
to
make
you
feel
at
home
you
ve
no
idea
what
good
times
we
have
here
while
you
are
far
i
tried
stopping
on
one
year
said
the
third
swallow
i
had
grown
so
fond
of
the
place
that
when
the
time
came
i
hung
back
and
let
the
others
go
on
without
me
for
a
few
weeks
it
was
all
well
enough
but
afterwards
o
the
weary
length
of
the
nights
the
shivering
sunless
days
the
air
so
clammy
and
chill
and
not
an
insect
in
an
acre
of
it
no
it
was
no
good
my
courage
broke
down
and
one
cold
stormy
night
i
took
wing
flying
well
inland
on
account
of
the
strong
easterly
gales
it
was
snowing
hard
as
i
beat
through
the
passes
of
the
great
mountains
and
i
had
a
stiff
fight
to
win
through
but
never
shall
i
forget
the
blissful
feeling
of
the
hot
sun
again
on
my
back
as
i
sped
down
to
the
lakes
that
lay
so
blue
and
placid
below
me
and
the
taste
of
my
first
fat
insect
the
past
was
like
a
bad
dream
the
future
was
all
happy
holiday
as
i
moved
southwards
week
by
week
easily
lazily
lingering
as
long
as
i
dared
but
always
heeding
the
call
no
i
had
had
my
warning
never
again
did
i
think
of
ah
yes
the
call
of
the
south
of
the
south
twittered
the
other
two
dreamily
its
songs
its
hues
its
radiant
air
o
do
you
remember
and
forgetting
the
rat
they
slid
into
passionate
reminiscence
while
he
listened
fascinated
and
his
heart
burned
within
him
in
himself
too
he
knew
that
it
was
vibrating
at
last
that
chord
hitherto
dormant
and
unsuspected
the
mere
chatter
of
these
birds
their
pale
and
reports
had
yet
power
to
awaken
this
wild
new
sensation
and
thrill
him
through
and
through
with
it
what
would
one
moment
of
the
real
thing
work
in
him
one
passionate
touch
of
the
real
southern
sun
one
waft
of
the
authentic
odor
with
closed
eyes
he
dared
to
dream
a
moment
in
full
abandonment
and
when
he
looked
again
the
river
seemed
steely
and
chill
the
green
fields
grey
and
lightless
then
his
loyal
heart
seemed
to
cry
out
on
his
weaker
self
for
its
treachery
why
do
you
ever
come
back
then
at
all
he
demanded
of
the
swallows
jealously
what
do
you
find
to
attract
you
in
this
poor
drab
little
country
and
do
you
think
said
the
first
swallow
that
the
other
call
is
not
for
us
too
in
its
due
season
the
call
of
lush
wet
orchards
warm
ponds
of
browsing
cattle
of
haymaking
and
all
the
clustering
round
the
house
of
the
perfect
eaves
do
you
suppose
asked
the
second
one
that
you
are
the
only
living
thing
that
craves
with
a
hungry
longing
to
hear
the
cuckoo
s
note
again
in
due
time
said
the
third
we
shall
be
once
more
for
quiet
swaying
on
the
surface
of
an
english
stream
but
all
that
seems
pale
and
thin
and
very
far
away
just
now
our
blood
dances
to
other
they
fell
among
themselves
once
more
and
this
time
their
intoxicating
babble
was
of
violet
seas
tawny
sands
and
walls
restlessly
the
rat
wandered
off
once
more
climbed
the
slope
that
rose
gently
from
the
north
bank
of
the
river
and
lay
looking
out
towards
the
great
ring
of
downs
that
barred
his
vision
further
southwards
his
simple
horizon
hitherto
his
mountains
of
the
moon
his
limit
behind
which
lay
nothing
he
had
cared
to
see
or
to
know
to
him
gazing
south
with
a
need
stirring
in
his
heart
the
clear
sky
over
their
long
low
outline
seemed
to
pulsate
with
promise
the
unseen
was
everything
the
unknown
the
only
real
fact
of
life
on
this
side
of
the
hills
was
now
the
real
blank
on
the
other
lay
the
crowded
and
coloured
panorama
that
his
inner
eye
was
seeing
so
clearly
what
seas
lay
beyond
green
leaping
and
crested
what
coasts
along
which
the
white
villas
glittered
against
the
olive
woods
what
quiet
harbours
thronged
with
gallant
shipping
bound
for
purple
islands
of
wine
and
spice
islands
set
low
in
languorous
waters
he
rose
and
descended
once
more
then
changed
his
mind
and
sought
the
side
of
the
dusty
lane
there
lying
in
the
thick
cool
tangle
that
bordered
it
he
could
muse
on
the
metalled
road
and
all
the
wondrous
world
that
it
led
to
on
all
the
wayfarers
too
that
might
have
trodden
it
and
the
fortunes
and
adventures
they
had
gone
to
seek
or
found
unseeking
out
there
beyond
beyond
footsteps
fell
on
his
ear
and
the
figure
of
one
that
walked
somewhat
wearily
came
into
view
and
he
saw
that
it
was
a
rat
and
a
very
dusty
one
the
wayfarer
as
he
reached
him
saluted
with
a
gesture
of
courtesy
that
had
something
foreign
about
it
hesitated
a
moment
then
with
a
pleasant
smile
turned
from
the
track
and
sat
down
by
his
side
in
the
cool
herbage
he
seemed
tired
and
the
rat
let
him
rest
unquestioned
understanding
something
of
what
was
in
his
thoughts
knowing
too
the
value
all
animals
attach
at
times
to
mere
silent
companionship
when
the
weary
muscles
slacken
and
the
mind
marks
time
the
wayfarer
was
lean
and
and
somewhat
bowed
at
the
shoulders
his
paws
were
thin
and
long
his
eyes
much
wrinkled
at
the
corners
and
he
wore
small
gold
ear
rings
in
his
ears
his
knitted
jersey
was
of
a
faded
blue
his
breeches
patched
and
stained
were
based
on
a
blue
foundation
and
his
small
belongings
that
he
carried
were
tied
up
in
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
when
he
had
rested
awhile
the
stranger
sighed
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
about
him
that
was
clover
that
warm
whiff
on
the
breeze
he
remarked
and
those
are
cows
we
hear
cropping
the
grass
behind
us
and
blowing
softly
between
mouthfuls
there
is
a
sound
of
distant
reapers
and
yonder
rises
a
blue
line
of
cottage
smoke
against
the
woodland
the
river
runs
somewhere
close
by
for
i
hear
the
call
of
a
moorhen
and
i
see
by
your
build
that
you
re
a
freshwater
mariner
everything
seems
asleep
and
yet
going
on
all
the
time
it
is
a
goodly
life
that
you
lead
friend
no
doubt
the
best
in
the
world
if
only
you
are
strong
enough
to
lead
it
yes
it
s
the
life
the
only
life
to
live
responded
the
water
rat
dreamily
and
without
his
usual
conviction
i
did
not
say
exactly
that
replied
the
stranger
cautiously
but
no
doubt
it
s
the
best
i
ve
tried
it
and
i
know
and
because
i
ve
just
tried
it
six
months
of
it
and
know
it
s
the
best
here
am
i
footsore
and
hungry
tramping
away
from
it
tramping
southward
following
the
old
call
back
to
the
old
life
the
life
which
is
mine
and
which
will
not
let
me
is
this
then
yet
another
of
them
mused
the
rat
and
where
have
you
just
come
from
he
asked
he
hardly
dared
to
ask
where
he
was
bound
for
he
seemed
to
know
the
answer
only
too
well
nice
little
farm
replied
the
wayfarer
briefly
upalong
in
that
direction
he
nodded
northwards
never
mind
about
it
i
had
everything
i
could
want
everything
i
had
any
right
to
expect
of
life
and
more
and
here
i
am
glad
to
be
here
all
the
same
though
glad
to
be
here
so
many
miles
further
on
the
road
so
many
hours
nearer
to
my
heart
s
desire
his
shining
eyes
held
fast
to
the
horizon
and
he
seemed
to
be
listening
for
some
sound
that
was
wanting
from
that
inland
acreage
vocal
as
it
was
with
the
cheerful
music
of
pasturage
and
farmyard
you
are
not
one
of
us
said
the
water
rat
nor
yet
a
farmer
nor
even
i
should
judge
of
this
right
replied
the
stranger
i
m
a
seafaring
rat
i
am
and
the
port
i
originally
hail
from
is
constantinople
though
i
m
a
sort
of
a
foreigner
there
too
in
a
manner
of
speaking
you
will
have
heard
of
constantinople
friend
a
fair
city
and
an
ancient
and
glorious
one
and
you
may
have
heard
too
of
sigurd
king
of
norway
and
how
he
sailed
thither
with
sixty
ships
and
how
he
and
his
men
rode
up
through
streets
all
canopied
in
their
honour
with
purple
and
gold
and
how
the
emperor
and
empress
came
down
and
banqueted
with
him
on
board
his
ship
when
sigurd
returned
home
many
of
his
northmen
remained
behind
and
entered
the
emperor
s
and
my
ancestor
a
norwegian
born
stayed
behind
too
with
the
ships
that
sigurd
gave
the
emperor
seafarers
we
have
ever
been
and
no
wonder
as
for
me
the
city
of
my
birth
is
no
more
my
home
than
any
pleasant
port
between
there
and
the
london
river
i
know
them
all
and
they
know
me
set
me
down
on
any
of
their
quays
or
foreshores
and
i
am
home
i
suppose
you
go
great
voyages
said
the
water
rat
with
growing
interest
months
and
months
out
of
sight
of
land
and
provisions
running
short
and
allowanced
as
to
water
and
your
mind
communing
with
the
mighty
ocean
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
by
no
means
said
the
sea
rat
frankly
such
a
life
as
you
describe
would
not
suit
me
at
all
i
m
in
the
coasting
trade
and
rarely
out
of
sight
of
land
it
s
the
jolly
times
on
shore
that
appeal
to
me
as
much
as
any
seafaring
o
those
southern
seaports
the
smell
of
them
the
at
night
the
glamour
well
perhaps
you
have
chosen
the
better
way
said
the
water
rat
but
rather
doubtfully
tell
me
something
of
your
coasting
then
if
you
have
a
mind
to
and
what
sort
of
harvest
an
animal
of
spirit
might
hope
to
bring
home
from
it
to
warm
his
latter
days
with
gallant
memories
by
the
fireside
for
my
life
i
confess
to
you
feels
to
me
somewhat
narrow
and
my
last
voyage
began
the
sea
rat
that
landed
me
eventually
in
this
country
bound
with
high
hopes
for
my
inland
farm
will
serve
as
a
good
example
of
any
of
them
and
indeed
as
an
epitome
of
my
life
family
troubles
as
usual
began
it
the
domestic
was
hoisted
and
i
shipped
myself
on
board
a
small
trading
vessel
bound
from
constantinople
by
classic
seas
whose
every
wave
throbs
with
a
deathless
memory
to
the
grecian
islands
and
the
levant
those
were
golden
days
and
balmy
nights
in
and
out
of
harbour
all
the
time
old
friends
everywhere
sleeping
in
some
cool
temple
or
ruined
cistern
during
the
heat
of
the
day
feasting
and
song
after
sundown
under
great
stars
set
in
a
velvet
sky
thence
we
turned
and
coasted
up
the
adriatic
its
shores
swimming
in
an
atmosphere
of
amber
rose
and
aquamarine
we
lay
in
wide
harbours
we
roamed
through
ancient
and
noble
cities
until
at
last
one
morning
as
the
sun
rose
royally
behind
us
we
rode
into
venice
down
a
path
of
gold
o
venice
is
a
fine
city
wherein
a
rat
can
wander
at
his
ease
and
take
his
pleasure
or
when
weary
of
wandering
can
sit
at
the
edge
of
the
grand
canal
at
night
feasting
with
his
friends
when
the
air
is
full
of
music
and
the
sky
full
of
stars
and
the
lights
flash
and
shimmer
on
the
polished
steel
prows
of
the
swaying
gondolas
packed
so
that
you
could
walk
across
the
canal
on
them
from
side
to
side
and
then
the
food
do
you
like
shellfish
well
well
we
won
t
linger
over
that
he
was
silent
for
a
time
and
the
water
rat
silent
too
and
enthralled
floated
on
and
heard
a
phantom
song
pealing
high
between
vaporous
grey
walls
southwards
we
sailed
again
at
last
continued
the
sea
rat
coasting
down
the
italian
shore
till
finally
we
made
palermo
and
there
i
quitted
for
a
long
happy
spell
on
shore
i
never
stick
too
long
to
one
ship
one
gets
and
prejudiced
besides
sicily
is
one
of
my
happy
i
know
everybody
there
and
their
ways
just
suit
me
i
spent
many
jolly
weeks
in
the
island
staying
with
friends
up
country
when
i
grew
restless
again
i
took
advantage
of
a
ship
that
was
trading
to
sardinia
and
corsica
and
very
glad
i
was
to
feel
the
fresh
breeze
and
the
in
my
face
once
but
isn
t
it
very
hot
and
stuffy
down
in
the
hold
i
think
you
call
it
asked
the
water
rat
the
seafarer
looked
at
him
with
the
suspicion
of
a
wink
i
m
an
old
hand
he
remarked
with
much
simplicity
the
captain
s
cabin
s
good
enough
for
it
s
a
hard
life
by
all
accounts
murmured
the
rat
sunk
in
deep
thought
for
the
crew
it
is
replied
the
seafarer
gravely
again
with
the
ghost
of
a
wink
from
corsica
he
went
on
i
made
use
of
a
ship
that
was
taking
wine
to
the
mainland
we
made
alassio
in
the
evening
lay
to
hauled
up
our
and
hove
them
overboard
tied
one
to
the
other
by
a
long
line
then
the
crew
took
to
the
boats
and
rowed
shorewards
singing
as
they
went
and
drawing
after
them
the
long
bobbing
procession
of
casks
like
a
mile
of
porpoises
on
the
sands
they
had
horses
waiting
which
dragged
the
casks
up
the
steep
street
of
the
little
town
with
a
fine
rush
and
clatter
and
scramble
when
the
last
cask
was
in
we
went
and
refreshed
and
rested
and
sat
late
into
the
night
drinking
with
our
friends
and
next
morning
i
took
to
the
great
for
a
spell
and
a
rest
for
now
i
had
done
with
islands
for
the
time
and
ports
and
shipping
were
plentiful
so
i
led
a
lazy
life
among
the
peasants
lying
and
watching
them
work
or
stretched
high
on
the
hillside
with
the
blue
mediterranean
far
below
me
and
so
at
length
by
easy
stages
and
partly
on
foot
partly
by
sea
to
marseilles
and
the
meeting
of
old
shipmates
and
the
visiting
of
great
vessels
and
feasting
once
more
talk
of
why
sometimes
i
dream
of
the
of
marseilles
and
wake
up
crying
that
reminds
me
said
the
polite
water
rat
you
happened
to
mention
that
you
were
hungry
and
i
ought
to
have
spoken
earlier
of
course
you
will
stop
and
take
your
midday
meal
with
me
my
hole
is
close
by
it
is
some
time
past
noon
and
you
are
very
welcome
to
whatever
there
now
i
call
that
kind
and
brotherly
of
you
said
the
sea
rat
i
was
indeed
hungry
when
i
sat
down
and
ever
since
i
inadvertently
happened
to
mention
my
pangs
have
been
extreme
but
couldn
t
you
fetch
it
along
out
here
i
am
none
too
fond
of
going
under
hatches
unless
i
m
obliged
to
and
then
while
we
eat
i
could
tell
you
more
concerning
my
voyages
and
the
pleasant
life
i
lead
at
least
it
is
very
pleasant
to
me
and
by
your
attention
i
judge
it
commends
itself
to
you
whereas
if
we
go
indoors
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
that
i
shall
presently
fall
that
is
indeed
an
excellent
suggestion
said
the
water
rat
and
hurried
off
home
there
he
got
out
the
and
packed
a
simple
meal
in
which
remembering
the
stranger
s
origin
and
preferences
he
took
care
to
include
a
yard
of
long
french
bread
a
sausage
out
of
which
the
garlic
sang
some
cheese
which
lay
down
and
cried
and
a
flask
wherein
lay
bottled
sunshine
shed
and
garnered
on
far
southern
slopes
thus
laden
he
returned
with
all
speed
and
blushed
for
pleasure
at
the
old
seaman
s
commendations
of
his
taste
and
judgment
as
together
they
unpacked
the
basket
and
laid
out
the
contents
on
the
grass
by
the
roadside
the
sea
rat
as
soon
as
his
hunger
was
somewhat
assuaged
continued
the
history
of
his
latest
voyage
conducting
his
simple
hearer
from
port
to
port
of
spain
landing
him
at
lisbon
oporto
and
bordeaux
introducing
him
to
the
pleasant
harbours
of
cornwall
and
devon
and
so
up
the
channel
to
that
final
quayside
where
landing
after
winds
long
contrary
and
he
had
caught
the
first
magical
hints
and
heraldings
of
another
spring
and
fired
by
these
had
sped
on
a
long
tramp
inland
hungry
for
the
experiment
of
life
on
some
quiet
farmstead
very
far
from
the
weary
beating
of
any
sea
and
quivering
with
excitement
the
water
rat
followed
the
adventurer
league
by
league
over
stormy
bays
through
crowded
roadsteads
across
harbour
bars
on
a
racing
tide
up
winding
rivers
that
hid
their
busy
little
towns
round
a
sudden
turn
and
left
him
with
a
regretful
sigh
planted
at
his
dull
inland
farm
about
which
he
desired
to
hear
nothing
by
this
time
their
meal
was
over
and
the
seafarer
refreshed
and
strengthened
his
voice
more
vibrant
his
eye
lit
with
a
brightness
that
seemed
caught
from
some
filled
his
glass
with
the
red
and
glowing
vintage
of
the
south
and
leaning
towards
the
water
rat
compelled
his
gaze
and
held
him
body
and
soul
while
he
talked
those
eyes
were
of
the
changing
of
leaping
northern
seas
in
the
glass
shone
a
hot
ruby
that
seemed
the
very
heart
of
the
south
beating
for
him
who
had
courage
to
respond
to
its
pulsation
the
twin
lights
the
shifting
grey
and
the
steadfast
red
mastered
the
water
rat
and
held
him
bound
fascinated
powerless
the
quiet
world
outside
their
rays
receded
far
away
and
ceased
to
be
and
the
talk
the
wonderful
talk
flowed
on
or
was
it
speech
entirely
or
did
it
pass
at
times
into
song
chanty
of
the
sailors
weighing
the
dripping
anchor
sonorous
hum
of
the
shrouds
in
a
tearing
ballad
of
the
fisherman
hauling
his
nets
at
sundown
against
an
apricot
sky
chords
of
guitar
and
mandoline
from
gondola
or
caique
did
it
change
into
the
cry
of
the
wind
plaintive
at
first
angrily
shrill
as
it
freshened
rising
to
a
tearing
whistle
sinking
to
a
musical
trickle
of
air
from
the
leech
of
the
bellying
sail
all
these
sounds
the
listener
seemed
to
hear
and
with
them
the
hungry
complaint
of
the
gulls
and
the
the
soft
thunder
of
the
breaking
wave
the
cry
of
the
protesting
shingle
back
into
speech
again
it
passed
and
with
beating
heart
he
was
following
the
adventures
of
a
dozen
seaports
the
fights
the
escapes
the
rallies
the
comradeships
the
gallant
undertakings
or
he
searched
islands
for
treasure
fished
in
still
lagoons
and
dozed
on
warm
white
sand
of
fishings
he
heard
tell
and
mighty
silver
gatherings
of
the
net
of
sudden
perils
noise
of
breakers
on
a
moonless
night
or
the
tall
bows
of
the
great
liner
taking
shape
overhead
through
the
fog
of
the
merry
the
headland
rounded
the
harbour
lights
opened
out
the
groups
seen
dimly
on
the
quay
the
cheery
hail
the
splash
of
the
hawser
the
trudge
up
the
steep
little
street
towards
the
comforting
glow
of
windows
lastly
in
his
waking
dream
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
adventurer
had
risen
to
his
feet
but
was
still
speaking
still
holding
him
fast
with
his
eyes
and
now
he
was
softly
saying
i
take
to
the
road
again
holding
on
southwestwards
for
many
a
long
and
dusty
day
till
at
last
i
reach
the
little
grey
sea
town
i
know
so
well
that
clings
along
one
steep
side
of
the
harbour
there
through
dark
doorways
you
look
down
flights
of
stone
steps
overhung
by
great
pink
tufts
of
valerian
and
ending
in
a
patch
of
sparkling
blue
water
the
little
boats
that
lie
tethered
to
the
rings
and
stanchions
of
the
old
are
gaily
painted
as
those
i
clambered
in
and
out
of
in
my
own
childhood
the
salmon
leap
on
the
flood
tide
schools
of
mackerel
flash
and
play
past
and
foreshores
and
by
the
windows
the
great
vessels
glide
night
and
day
up
to
their
moorings
or
forth
to
the
open
sea
there
sooner
or
later
the
ships
of
all
seafaring
nations
arrive
and
there
at
its
destined
hour
the
ship
of
my
choice
will
let
go
its
anchor
i
shall
take
my
time
i
shall
tarry
and
bide
till
at
last
the
right
one
lies
waiting
for
me
warped
out
into
midstream
loaded
low
her
bowsprit
pointing
down
harbour
i
shall
slip
on
board
by
boat
or
along
hawser
and
then
one
morning
i
shall
wake
to
the
song
and
tramp
of
the
sailors
the
clink
of
the
capstan
and
the
rattle
of
the
coming
merrily
in
we
shall
break
out
the
jib
and
the
foresail
the
white
houses
on
the
harbour
side
will
glide
slowly
past
us
as
she
gathers
and
the
voyage
will
have
begun
as
she
forges
towards
the
headland
she
will
clothe
herself
with
canvas
and
then
once
outside
the
sounding
slap
of
great
green
seas
as
she
heels
to
the
wind
pointing
south
and
you
you
will
come
too
young
brother
for
the
days
pass
and
never
return
and
the
south
still
waits
for
you
take
the
adventure
heed
the
call
now
ere
the
irrevocable
moment
passes
tis
but
a
banging
of
the
door
behind
you
a
blithesome
step
forward
and
you
are
out
of
the
old
life
and
into
the
new
then
some
day
some
day
long
hence
jog
home
here
if
you
will
when
the
cup
has
been
drained
and
the
play
has
been
played
and
sit
down
by
your
quiet
river
with
a
store
of
goodly
memories
for
company
you
can
easily
overtake
me
on
the
road
for
you
are
young
and
i
am
ageing
and
go
softly
i
will
linger
and
look
back
and
at
last
i
will
surely
see
you
coming
eager
and
with
all
the
south
in
your
face
the
voice
died
away
and
ceased
as
an
insect
s
tiny
trumpet
dwindles
swiftly
into
silence
and
the
water
rat
paralysed
and
staring
saw
at
last
but
a
distant
speck
on
the
white
surface
of
the
road
mechanically
he
rose
and
proceeded
to
repack
the
carefully
and
without
haste
mechanically
he
returned
home
gathered
together
a
few
small
necessaries
and
special
treasures
he
was
fond
of
and
put
them
in
a
satchel
acting
with
slow
deliberation
moving
about
the
room
like
a
listening
ever
with
parted
lips
he
swung
the
satchel
over
his
shoulder
carefully
selected
a
stout
stick
for
his
wayfaring
and
with
no
haste
but
with
no
hesitation
at
all
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
just
as
the
mole
appeared
at
the
door
why
where
are
you
off
to
ratty
asked
the
mole
in
great
surprise
grasping
him
by
the
arm
going
south
with
the
rest
of
them
murmured
the
rat
in
a
dreamy
monotone
never
looking
at
him
seawards
first
and
then
on
shipboard
and
so
to
the
shores
that
are
calling
me
he
pressed
resolutely
forward
still
without
haste
but
with
dogged
fixity
of
purpose
but
the
mole
now
thoroughly
alarmed
placed
himself
in
front
of
him
and
looking
into
his
eyes
saw
that
they
were
glazed
and
set
and
turned
a
streaked
and
shifting
grey
not
his
friend
s
eyes
but
the
eyes
of
some
other
animal
grappling
with
him
strongly
he
dragged
him
inside
threw
him
down
and
held
him
the
rat
struggled
desperately
for
a
few
moments
and
then
his
strength
seemed
suddenly
to
leave
him
and
he
lay
still
and
exhausted
with
closed
eyes
trembling
presently
the
mole
assisted
him
to
rise
and
placed
him
in
a
chair
where
he
sat
collapsed
and
shrunken
into
himself
his
body
shaken
by
a
violent
shivering
passing
in
time
into
an
hysterical
fit
of
dry
sobbing
mole
made
the
door
fast
threw
the
satchel
into
a
drawer
and
locked
it
and
sat
down
quietly
on
the
table
by
his
friend
waiting
for
the
strange
seizure
to
pass
gradually
the
rat
sank
into
a
troubled
doze
broken
by
starts
and
confused
murmurings
of
things
strange
and
wild
and
foreign
to
the
unenlightened
mole
and
from
that
he
passed
into
a
deep
slumber
very
anxious
in
mind
the
mole
left
him
for
a
time
and
busied
himself
with
household
matters
and
it
was
getting
dark
when
he
returned
to
the
parlour
and
found
the
rat
where
he
had
left
him
wide
awake
indeed
but
listless
silent
and
dejected
he
took
one
hasty
glance
at
his
eyes
found
them
to
his
great
gratification
clear
and
dark
and
brown
again
as
before
and
then
sat
down
and
tried
to
cheer
him
up
and
help
him
to
relate
what
had
happened
to
him
poor
ratty
did
his
best
by
degrees
to
explain
things
but
how
could
he
put
into
cold
words
what
had
mostly
been
suggestion
how
recall
for
another
s
benefit
the
haunting
sea
voices
that
had
sung
to
him
how
reproduce
at
the
magic
of
the
seafarer
s
hundred
reminiscences
even
to
himself
now
the
spell
was
broken
and
the
glamour
gone
he
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
what
had
seemed
some
hours
ago
the
inevitable
and
only
thing
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
he
failed
to
convey
to
the
mole
any
clear
idea
of
what
he
had
been
through
that
day
to
the
mole
this
much
was
plain
the
fit
or
attack
had
passed
away
and
had
left
him
sane
again
though
shaken
and
cast
down
by
the
reaction
but
he
seemed
to
have
lost
all
interest
for
the
time
in
the
things
that
went
to
make
up
his
daily
life
as
well
as
in
all
pleasant
forecastings
of
the
altered
days
and
doings
that
the
changing
season
was
surely
bringing
casually
then
and
with
seeming
indifference
the
mole
turned
his
talk
to
the
harvest
that
was
being
gathered
in
the
towering
wagons
and
their
straining
teams
the
growing
ricks
and
the
large
moon
rising
over
bare
acres
dotted
with
sheaves
he
talked
of
the
reddening
apples
around
of
the
browning
nuts
of
jams
and
preserves
and
the
distilling
of
cordials
till
by
easy
stages
such
as
these
he
reached
midwinter
its
hearty
joys
and
its
snug
home
life
and
then
he
became
simply
lyrical
by
degrees
the
rat
began
to
sit
up
and
to
join
in
his
dull
eye
brightened
and
he
lost
some
of
his
listening
air
presently
the
tactful
mole
slipped
away
and
returned
with
a
pencil
and
a
few
of
paper
which
he
placed
on
the
table
at
his
friend
s
elbow
it
s
quite
a
long
time
since
you
did
any
poetry
he
remarked
you
might
have
a
try
at
it
this
evening
instead
of
well
brooding
over
things
so
much
i
ve
an
idea
that
you
ll
feel
a
lot
better
when
you
ve
got
something
jotted
down
if
it
s
only
just
the
the
rat
pushed
the
paper
away
from
him
wearily
but
the
discreet
mole
took
occasion
to
leave
the
room
and
when
he
peeped
in
again
some
time
later
the
rat
was
absorbed
and
deaf
to
the
world
alternately
scribbling
and
sucking
the
top
of
his
pencil
it
is
true
that
he
sucked
a
good
deal
more
than
he
scribbled
but
it
was
joy
to
the
mole
to
know
that
the
cure
had
at
least
begun
x
the
further
adventures
of
toad
the
front
door
of
the
hollow
tree
faced
eastwards
so
toad
was
called
at
an
early
hour
partly
by
the
bright
sunlight
streaming
in
on
him
partly
by
the
exceeding
coldness
of
his
toes
which
made
him
dream
that
he
was
at
home
in
bed
in
his
own
handsome
room
with
the
tudor
window
on
a
cold
winter
s
night
and
his
bedclothes
had
got
up
grumbling
and
protesting
they
couldn
t
stand
the
cold
any
longer
and
had
run
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
fire
to
warm
themselves
and
he
had
followed
on
bare
feet
along
miles
and
miles
of
icy
passages
arguing
and
beseeching
them
to
be
reasonable
he
would
probably
have
been
aroused
much
earlier
had
he
not
slept
for
some
weeks
on
straw
over
stone
flags
and
almost
forgotten
the
friendly
feeling
of
thick
blankets
pulled
well
up
round
the
chin
sitting
up
he
rubbed
his
eyes
first
and
his
complaining
toes
next
wondered
for
a
moment
where
he
was
looking
round
for
familiar
stone
wall
and
little
barred
window
then
with
a
leap
of
the
heart
remembered
everything
his
escape
his
flight
his
pursuit
remembered
first
and
best
thing
of
all
that
he
was
free
free
the
word
and
the
thought
alone
were
worth
fifty
blankets
he
was
warm
from
end
to
end
as
he
thought
of
the
jolly
world
outside
waiting
eagerly
for
him
to
make
his
triumphal
entrance
ready
to
serve
him
and
play
up
to
him
anxious
to
help
him
and
to
keep
him
company
as
it
always
had
been
in
days
of
old
before
misfortune
fell
upon
him
he
shook
himself
and
combed
the
dry
leaves
out
of
his
hair
with
his
fingers
and
his
toilet
complete
marched
forth
into
the
comfortable
morning
sun
cold
but
confident
hungry
but
hopeful
all
nervous
terrors
of
yesterday
dispelled
by
rest
and
sleep
and
frank
and
heartening
sunshine
he
had
the
world
all
to
himself
that
early
summer
morning
the
dewy
woodland
as
he
threaded
it
was
solitary
and
still
the
green
fields
that
succeeded
the
trees
were
his
own
to
do
as
he
liked
with
the
road
itself
when
he
reached
it
in
that
loneliness
that
was
everywhere
seemed
like
a
stray
dog
to
be
looking
anxiously
for
company
toad
however
was
looking
for
something
that
could
talk
and
tell
him
clearly
which
way
he
ought
to
go
it
is
all
very
well
when
you
have
a
light
heart
and
a
clear
conscience
and
money
in
your
pocket
and
nobody
scouring
the
country
for
you
to
drag
you
off
to
prison
again
to
follow
where
the
road
beckons
and
points
not
caring
whither
the
practical
toad
cared
very
much
indeed
and
he
could
have
kicked
the
road
for
its
helpless
silence
when
every
minute
was
of
importance
to
him
the
reserved
rustic
road
was
presently
joined
by
a
shy
little
brother
in
the
shape
of
a
canal
which
took
its
hand
and
ambled
along
by
its
side
in
perfect
confidence
but
with
the
same
uncommunicative
attitude
towards
strangers
bother
them
said
toad
to
himself
but
anyhow
one
thing
s
clear
they
must
both
be
coming
from
somewhere
and
going
to
somewhere
you
can
t
get
over
that
toad
my
boy
so
he
marched
on
patiently
by
the
water
s
edge
round
a
bend
in
the
canal
came
plodding
a
solitary
horse
stooping
forward
as
if
in
anxious
thought
from
rope
traces
attached
to
his
collar
stretched
a
long
line
taut
but
dipping
with
his
stride
the
further
part
of
it
dripping
pearly
drops
toad
let
the
horse
pass
and
stood
waiting
for
what
the
fates
were
sending
him
with
a
pleasant
swirl
of
quiet
water
at
its
blunt
bow
the
barge
slid
up
alongside
of
him
its
gaily
painted
gunwale
level
with
the
its
sole
occupant
a
big
stout
woman
wearing
a
linen
one
brawny
arm
laid
along
the
tiller
a
nice
morning
ma
am
she
remarked
to
toad
as
she
drew
up
level
with
him
i
dare
say
it
is
ma
am
responded
toad
politely
as
he
walked
along
the
abreast
of
her
i
dare
it
is
a
nice
morning
to
them
that
s
not
in
sore
trouble
like
what
i
am
here
s
my
married
daughter
she
sends
off
to
me
to
come
to
her
at
once
so
off
i
comes
not
knowing
what
may
be
happening
or
going
to
happen
but
fearing
the
worst
as
you
will
understand
ma
am
if
you
re
a
mother
too
and
i
ve
left
my
business
to
look
after
itself
i
m
in
the
washing
and
laundering
line
you
must
know
ma
am
and
i
ve
left
my
young
children
to
look
after
themselves
and
a
more
mischievous
and
troublesome
set
of
young
imps
doesn
t
exist
ma
am
and
i
ve
lost
all
my
money
and
lost
my
way
and
as
for
what
may
be
happening
to
my
married
daughter
why
i
don
t
like
to
think
of
it
ma
am
where
might
your
married
daughter
be
living
ma
am
asked
the
she
lives
near
to
the
river
ma
am
replied
toad
close
to
a
fine
house
called
toad
hall
that
s
somewheres
hereabouts
in
these
parts
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
toad
hall
why
i
m
going
that
way
myself
replied
the
this
canal
joins
the
river
some
miles
further
on
a
little
above
toad
hall
and
then
it
s
an
easy
walk
you
come
along
in
the
barge
with
me
and
i
ll
give
you
a
she
steered
the
barge
close
to
the
bank
and
toad
with
many
humble
and
grateful
acknowledgments
stepped
lightly
on
board
and
sat
down
with
great
satisfaction
toad
s
luck
again
thought
he
i
always
come
out
on
top
so
you
re
in
the
washing
business

am
said
the
politely
as
they

very
good
business

got
too
i
dare
say
if
i
m
not
making
too
free
in
saying

business

the
whole
country

toad
airily

the
gentry

to
me

go
to
any
one
else
if
they
were
paid
they
know
me
so
well

to
it
all
myself
washing

making
up
gents
fine
shirts

eye

i
too
said
the
with
great
heartiness
but
i
dare
say
you
set
yours
to
rights
the
idle
trollops
and
are
you
very
fond
of
washing
i
love
it
said
toad
i
simply
dote
on
it
never
so
happy
as
when
i
ve
got
both
arms
in
the
but
then
it
comes
so
easy
to
me
no
trouble
at
all
a
real
pleasure
i
assure
you
ma
am
what
a
bit
of
luck
meeting
you
observed
the
thoughtfully
a
regular
piece
of
good
fortune
for
both
of
us
why
what
do
you
mean
asked
toad
nervously
well
look
at
me
now
replied
the
like
washing
too
just
the
same
as
you
do
and
for
that
matter
whether
i
like
it
or
not
i
have
got
to
do
all
my
own
naturally
moving
about
as
i
do
now
my
husband
he
s
such
a
fellow
for
shirking
his
work
and
leaving
the
barge
to
me
that
never
a
moment
do
i
get
for
seeing
to
my
own
affairs
by
rights
he
ought
to
be
here
now
either
steering
or
attending
to
the
horse
though
luckily
the
horse
has
sense
enough
to
attend
to
himself
instead
of
which
he
s
gone
off
with
the
dog
to
see
if
they
can
t
pick
up
a
rabbit
for
dinner
somewhere
says
he
ll
catch
me
up
at
the
next
lock
well
that
s
as
may
be
i
don
t
trust
him
once
he
gets
off
with
that
dog
who
s
worse
than
he
is
but
meantime
how
am
i
to
get
on
with
my
washing
o
never
mind
about
the
washing
said
toad
not
liking
the
subject
try
and
fix
your
mind
on
that
rabbit
a
nice
fat
young
rabbit
i
ll
be
bound
got
any
onions
i
can
t
fix
my
mind
on
anything
but
my
washing
said
the
and
i
wonder
you
can
be
talking
of
rabbits
with
such
a
joyful
prospect
before
you
there
s
a
heap
of
things
of
mine
that
you
ll
find
in
a
corner
of
the
cabin
if
you
ll
just
take
one
or
two
of
the
most
necessary
sort
i
won
t
venture
to
describe
them
to
a
lady
like
you
but
you
ll
recognise
them
at
a
glance
and
put
them
through
the
as
we
go
along
why
it
ll
be
a
pleasure
to
you
as
you
rightly
say
and
a
real
help
to
me
you
ll
find
a
tub
handy
and
soap
and
a
kettle
on
the
stove
and
a
bucket
to
haul
up
water
from
the
canal
with
then
i
shall
know
you
re
enjoying
yourself
instead
of
sitting
here
idle
looking
at
the
scenery
and
yawning
your
head
here
you
let
me
steer
said
toad
now
thoroughly
frightened
and
then
you
can
get
on
with
your
washing
your
own
way
i
might
spoil
your
things
or
not
do
em
as
you
like
i
m
more
used
to
gentlemen
s
things
myself
it
s
my
special
let
you
steer
replied
the
laughing
it
takes
some
practice
to
steer
a
barge
properly
besides
it
s
dull
work
and
i
want
you
to
be
happy
no
you
shall
do
the
washing
you
are
so
fond
of
and
i
ll
stick
to
the
steering
that
i
understand
don
t
try
and
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
of
giving
you
a
treat
toad
was
fairly
cornered
he
looked
for
escape
this
way
and
that
saw
that
he
was
too
far
from
the
bank
for
a
flying
leap
and
sullenly
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
if
it
comes
to
that
he
thought
in
desperation
i
suppose
any
fool
can
wash
he
fetched
tub
soap
and
other
necessaries
from
the
cabin
selected
a
few
garments
at
random
tried
to
recollect
what
he
had
seen
in
casual
glances
through
laundry
windows
and
set
to
a
long
passed
and
every
minute
of
it
saw
toad
getting
crosser
and
crosser
nothing
that
he
could
do
to
the
things
seemed
to
please
them
or
do
them
good
he
tried
coaxing
he
tried
slapping
he
tried
punching
they
smiled
back
at
him
out
of
the
tub
unconverted
happy
in
their
original
sin
once
or
twice
he
looked
nervously
over
his
shoulder
at
the
but
she
appeared
to
be
gazing
out
in
front
of
her
absorbed
in
her
steering
his
back
ached
badly
and
he
noticed
with
dismay
that
his
paws
were
beginning
to
get
all
crinkly
now
toad
was
very
proud
of
his
paws
he
muttered
under
his
breath
words
that
should
never
pass
the
lips
of
either
washerwomen
or
toads
and
lost
the
soap
for
the
fiftieth
time
a
burst
of
laughter
made
him
straighten
himself
and
look
round
the
was
leaning
back
and
laughing
unrestrainedly
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
i
ve
been
watching
you
all
the
time
she
gasped
i
thought
you
must
be
a
humbug
all
along
from
the
conceited
way
you
talked
pretty
washerwoman
you
are
never
washed
so
much
as
a
in
your
life
i
ll
lay
toad
s
temper
which
had
been
simmering
viciously
for
some
time
now
fairly
boiled
over
and
he
lost
all
control
of
himself
you
common
low
fat
he
shouted
don
t
you
dare
to
talk
to
your
betters
like
that
washerwoman
indeed
i
would
have
you
to
know
that
i
am
a
toad
a
very
respected
distinguished
toad
i
may
be
under
a
bit
of
a
cloud
at
present
but
i
will
not
be
laughed
at
by
a
bargewoman
the
woman
moved
nearer
to
him
and
peered
under
his
bonnet
keenly
and
closely
why
so
you
are
she
cried
well
i
never
a
horrid
nasty
crawly
toad
and
in
my
nice
clean
barge
too
now
that
is
a
thing
that
i
will
not
she
relinquished
the
tiller
for
a
moment
one
big
mottled
arm
shot
out
and
caught
toad
by
a
while
the
him
fast
by
a
then
the
world
turned
suddenly
upside
down
the
barge
seemed
to
flit
lightly
across
the
sky
the
wind
whistled
in
his
ears
and
toad
found
himself
flying
through
the
air
revolving
rapidly
as
he
went
the
water
when
he
eventually
reached
it
with
a
loud
splash
proved
quite
cold
enough
for
his
taste
though
its
chill
was
not
sufficient
to
quell
his
proud
spirit
or
slake
the
heat
of
his
furious
temper
he
rose
to
the
surface
spluttering
and
when
he
had
wiped
the
out
of
his
eyes
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
fat
looking
back
at
him
over
the
stern
of
the
retreating
barge
and
laughing
and
he
vowed
as
he
coughed
and
choked
to
be
even
with
her
he
struck
out
for
the
shore
but
the
cotton
gown
greatly
impeded
his
efforts
and
when
at
length
he
touched
land
he
found
it
hard
to
climb
up
the
steep
bank
unassisted
he
had
to
take
a
minute
or
two
s
rest
to
recover
his
breath
then
gathering
his
wet
skirts
well
over
his
arms
he
started
to
run
after
the
barge
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
wild
with
indignation
thirsting
for
revenge
the
was
still
laughing
when
he
drew
up
level
with
her
put
yourself
through
your
mangle
washerwoman
she
called
out
and
iron
your
face
and
crimp
it
and
you
ll
pass
for
quite
a
toad
toad
never
paused
to
reply
solid
revenge
was
what
he
wanted
not
cheap
windy
verbal
triumphs
though
he
had
a
thing
or
two
in
his
mind
that
he
would
have
liked
to
say
he
saw
what
he
wanted
ahead
of
him
running
swiftly
on
he
overtook
the
horse
unfastened
the
towrope
and
cast
off
jumped
lightly
on
the
horse
s
back
and
urged
it
to
a
gallop
by
kicking
it
vigorously
in
the
sides
he
steered
for
the
open
country
abandoning
the
and
swinging
his
steed
down
a
rutty
lane
once
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
barge
had
run
aground
on
the
other
side
of
the
canal
and
the
was
gesticulating
wildly
and
shouting
stop
stop
stop
i
ve
heard
that
song
before
said
toad
laughing
as
he
continued
to
spur
his
steed
onward
in
its
wild
career
the
was
not
capable
of
any
very
sustained
effort
and
its
gallop
soon
subsided
into
a
trot
and
its
trot
into
an
easy
walk
but
toad
was
quite
contented
with
this
knowing
that
he
at
any
rate
was
moving
and
the
barge
was
not
he
had
quite
recovered
his
temper
now
that
he
had
done
something
he
thought
really
clever
and
he
was
satisfied
to
jog
along
quietly
in
the
sun
steering
his
horse
along
and
and
trying
to
forget
how
very
long
it
was
since
he
had
had
a
square
meal
till
the
canal
had
been
left
very
far
behind
him
he
had
travelled
some
miles
his
horse
and
he
and
he
was
feeling
drowsy
in
the
hot
sunshine
when
the
horse
stopped
lowered
his
head
and
began
to
nibble
the
grass
and
toad
waking
up
just
saved
himself
from
falling
off
by
an
effort
he
looked
about
him
and
found
he
was
on
a
wide
common
dotted
with
patches
of
gorse
and
bramble
as
far
as
he
could
see
near
him
stood
a
dingy
gipsy
caravan
and
beside
it
a
man
was
sitting
on
a
bucket
turned
upside
down
very
busy
smoking
and
staring
into
the
wide
world
a
fire
of
sticks
was
burning
near
by
and
over
the
fire
hung
an
iron
pot
and
out
of
that
pot
came
forth
bubblings
and
gurglings
and
a
vague
suggestive
steaminess
also
smells
warm
rich
and
varied
smells
that
twined
and
twisted
and
wreathed
themselves
at
last
into
one
complete
voluptuous
perfect
smell
that
seemed
like
the
very
soul
of
nature
taking
form
and
appearing
to
her
children
a
true
goddess
a
mother
of
solace
and
comfort
toad
now
knew
well
that
he
had
not
been
really
hungry
before
what
he
had
felt
earlier
in
the
day
had
been
a
mere
trifling
qualm
this
was
the
real
thing
at
last
and
no
mistake
and
it
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
speedily
too
or
there
would
be
trouble
for
somebody
or
something
he
looked
the
gipsy
over
carefully
wondering
vaguely
whether
it
would
be
easier
to
fight
him
or
cajole
him
so
there
he
sat
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
and
looked
at
the
gipsy
and
the
gipsy
sat
and
smoked
and
looked
at
him
presently
the
gipsy
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
remarked
in
a
careless
way
want
to
sell
that
there
horse
of
yours
toad
was
completely
taken
aback
he
did
not
know
that
gipsies
were
very
fond
of
and
never
missed
an
opportunity
and
he
had
not
reflected
that
caravans
were
always
on
the
move
and
took
a
deal
of
drawing
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
turn
the
horse
into
cash
but
the
gipsy
s
suggestion
seemed
to
smooth
the
way
towards
the
two
things
he
wanted
so
badly
ready
money
and
a
solid
breakfast
what
he
said
me
sell
this
beautiful
young
horse
of
mine
o
no
it
s
out
of
the
question
who
s
going
to
take
the
washing
home
to
my
customers
every
week
besides
i
m
too
fond
of
him
and
he
simply
dotes
on
try
and
love
a
donkey
suggested
the
gipsy
some
people
you
don
t
seem
to
see
continued
toad
that
this
fine
horse
of
mine
is
a
cut
above
you
altogether
he
s
a
blood
horse
he
is
partly
not
the
part
you
see
of
course
another
part
and
he
s
been
a
prize
hackney
too
in
his
time
that
was
the
time
before
you
knew
him
but
you
can
still
tell
it
on
him
at
a
glance
if
you
understand
anything
about
horses
no
it
s
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
all
the
same
how
much
might
you
be
disposed
to
offer
me
for
this
beautiful
young
horse
of
mine
the
gipsy
looked
the
horse
over
and
then
he
looked
toad
over
with
equal
care
and
looked
at
the
horse
again
shillin
a
leg
he
said
briefly
and
turned
away
continuing
to
smoke
and
try
to
stare
the
wide
world
out
of
countenance
a
shilling
a
leg
cried
toad
if
you
please
i
must
take
a
little
time
to
work
that
out
and
see
just
what
it
comes
he
climbed
down
off
his
horse
and
left
it
to
graze
and
sat
down
by
the
gipsy
and
did
sums
on
his
fingers
and
at
last
he
said
a
shilling
a
leg
why
that
comes
to
exactly
four
shillings
and
no
more
o
no
i
could
not
think
of
accepting
four
shillings
for
this
beautiful
young
horse
of
well
said
the
gipsy
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
ll
make
it
five
shillings
and
that
s
more
than
the
animal
s
worth
and
that
s
my
last
then
toad
sat
and
pondered
long
and
deeply
for
he
was
hungry
and
quite
penniless
and
still
some
way
he
knew
not
how
far
from
home
and
enemies
might
still
be
looking
for
him
to
one
in
such
a
situation
five
shillings
may
very
well
appear
a
large
sum
of
money
on
the
other
hand
it
did
not
seem
very
much
to
get
for
a
horse
but
then
again
the
horse
hadn
t
cost
him
anything
so
whatever
he
got
was
all
clear
profit
at
last
he
said
firmly
look
here
gipsy
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
and
this
is
my
last
word
you
shall
hand
me
over
six
shillings
and
sixpence
cash
down
and
further
in
addition
thereto
you
shall
give
me
as
much
breakfast
as
i
can
possibly
eat
at
one
sitting
of
course
out
of
that
iron
pot
of
yours
that
keeps
sending
forth
such
delicious
and
exciting
smells
in
return
i
will
make
over
to
you
my
spirited
young
horse
with
all
the
beautiful
harness
and
trappings
that
are
on
him
freely
thrown
in
if
that
s
not
good
enough
for
you
say
so
and
i
ll
be
getting
on
i
know
a
man
near
here
who
s
wanted
this
horse
of
mine
for
the
gipsy
grumbled
frightfully
and
declared
if
he
did
a
few
more
deals
of
that
sort
he
d
be
ruined
but
in
the
end
he
lugged
a
dirty
canvas
bag
out
of
the
depths
of
his
trouser
pocket
and
counted
out
six
shillings
and
sixpence
into
toad
s
paw
then
he
disappeared
into
the
caravan
for
an
instant
and
returned
with
a
large
iron
plate
and
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
he
tilted
up
the
pot
and
a
glorious
stream
of
hot
rich
stew
gurgled
into
the
plate
it
was
indeed
the
most
beautiful
stew
in
the
world
being
made
of
partridges
and
pheasants
and
chickens
and
hares
and
rabbits
and
and
and
one
or
two
other
things
toad
took
the
plate
on
his
lap
almost
crying
and
stuffed
and
stuffed
and
stuffed
and
kept
asking
for
more
and
the
gipsy
never
grudged
it
him
he
thought
that
he
had
never
eaten
so
good
a
breakfast
in
all
his
life
when
toad
had
taken
as
much
stew
on
board
as
he
thought
he
could
possibly
hold
he
got
up
and
said
to
the
gipsy
and
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
horse
and
the
gipsy
who
knew
the
riverside
well
gave
him
directions
which
way
to
go
and
he
set
forth
on
his
travels
again
in
the
best
possible
spirits
he
was
indeed
a
very
different
toad
from
the
animal
of
an
hour
ago
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
his
wet
clothes
were
quite
dry
again
he
had
money
in
his
pocket
once
more
he
was
nearing
home
and
friends
and
safety
and
most
and
best
of
all
he
had
had
a
substantial
meal
hot
and
nourishing
and
felt
big
and
strong
and
careless
and
as
he
tramped
along
gaily
he
thought
of
his
adventures
and
escapes
and
how
when
things
seemed
at
their
worst
he
had
always
managed
to
find
a
way
out
and
his
pride
and
conceit
began
to
swell
within
him
ho
ho
he
said
to
himself
as
he
marched
along
with
his
chin
in
the
air
what
a
clever
toad
i
am
there
is
surely
no
animal
equal
to
me
for
cleverness
in
the
whole
world
my
enemies
shut
me
up
in
prison
encircled
by
sentries
watched
night
and
day
by
warders
i
walk
out
through
them
all
by
sheer
ability
coupled
with
courage
they
pursue
me
with
engines
and
policemen
and
revolvers
i
snap
my
fingers
at
them
and
vanish
laughing
into
space
i
am
unfortunately
thrown
into
a
canal
by
a
woman
fat
of
body
and
very
what
of
it
i
swim
ashore
i
seize
her
horse
i
ride
off
in
triumph
and
i
sell
the
horse
for
a
whole
pocketful
of
money
and
an
excellent
breakfast
ho
ho
i
am
the
toad
the
handsome
the
popular
the
successful
toad
he
got
so
puffed
up
with
conceit
that
he
made
up
a
song
as
he
walked
in
praise
of
himself
and
sang
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
though
there
was
no
one
to
hear
it
but
him
it
was
perhaps
the
most
conceited
song
that
any
animal
ever
composed
the
world
has
held
great
heroes
as
have
showed
but
never
a
name
to
go
down
to
fame
compared
with
that
of
toad
the
clever
men
at
oxford
know
all
that
there
is
to
be
knowed
but
they
none
of
them
know
one
half
as
much
as
intelligent
toad
the
animals
sat
in
the
ark
and
cried
their
tears
in
torrents
flowed
who
was
it
said
there
s
land
ahead
encouraging
toad
the
army
all
saluted
as
they
marched
along
the
road
was
it
the
king
or
kitchener
no
it
was
toad
the
queen
and
her
sat
at
the
window
and
sewed
she
cried
look
who
s
that
man
they
answered
mr
there
was
a
great
deal
more
of
the
same
sort
but
too
dreadfully
conceited
to
be
written
down
these
are
some
of
the
milder
verses
he
sang
as
he
walked
and
he
walked
as
he
sang
and
got
more
inflated
every
minute
but
his
pride
was
shortly
to
have
a
severe
fall
after
some
miles
of
country
lanes
he
reached
the
high
road
and
as
he
turned
into
it
and
glanced
along
its
white
length
he
saw
approaching
him
a
speck
that
turned
into
a
dot
and
then
into
a
blob
and
then
into
something
very
familiar
and
a
double
note
of
warning
only
too
well
known
fell
on
his
delighted
ear
this
is
something
like
said
the
excited
toad
this
is
real
life
again
this
is
once
more
the
great
world
from
which
i
have
been
missed
so
long
i
will
hail
them
my
brothers
of
the
wheel
and
pitch
them
a
yarn
of
the
sort
that
has
been
so
successful
hitherto
and
they
will
give
me
a
lift
of
course
and
then
i
will
talk
to
them
some
more
and
perhaps
with
luck
it
may
even
end
in
my
driving
up
to
toad
hall
in
a
that
will
be
one
in
the
eye
for
badger
he
stepped
confidently
out
into
the
road
to
hail
the
which
came
along
at
an
easy
pace
slowing
down
as
it
neared
the
lane
when
suddenly
he
became
very
pale
his
heart
turned
to
water
his
knees
shook
and
yielded
under
him
and
he
doubled
up
and
collapsed
with
a
sickening
pain
in
his
interior
and
well
he
might
the
unhappy
animal
for
the
approaching
car
was
the
very
one
he
had
stolen
out
of
the
yard
of
the
red
lion
hotel
on
that
fatal
day
when
all
his
troubles
began
and
the
people
in
it
were
the
very
same
people
he
had
sat
and
watched
at
luncheon
in
the
he
sank
down
in
a
shabby
miserable
heap
in
the
road
murmuring
to
himself
in
his
despair
it
s
all
up
it
s
all
over
now
chains
and
policemen
again
prison
again
dry
bread
and
water
again
o
what
a
fool
i
have
been
what
did
i
want
to
go
strutting
about
the
country
for
singing
conceited
songs
and
hailing
people
in
broad
day
on
the
high
road
instead
of
hiding
till
nightfall
and
slipping
home
quietly
by
back
ways
o
hapless
toad
o
animal
the
terrible
drew
slowly
nearer
and
nearer
till
at
last
he
heard
it
stop
just
short
of
him
two
gentlemen
got
out
and
walked
round
the
trembling
heap
of
crumpled
misery
lying
in
the
road
and
one
of
them
said
o
dear
this
is
very
sad
here
is
a
poor
old
thing
a
washerwoman
apparently
who
has
fainted
in
the
road
perhaps
she
is
overcome
by
the
heat
poor
creature
or
possibly
she
has
not
had
any
food
let
us
lift
her
into
the
car
and
take
her
to
the
nearest
village
where
doubtless
she
has
they
tenderly
lifted
toad
into
the
and
propped
him
up
with
soft
cushions
and
proceeded
on
their
way
when
toad
heard
them
talk
in
so
kind
and
sympathetic
a
way
and
knew
that
he
was
not
recognised
his
courage
began
to
revive
and
he
cautiously
opened
first
one
eye
and
then
the
other
look
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
she
is
better
already
the
fresh
air
is
doing
her
good
how
do
you
feel
now
ma
am
thank
you
kindly
sir
said
toad
in
a
feeble
voice
i
m
feeling
a
great
deal
better
that
s
right
said
the
gentleman
now
keep
quite
still
and
above
all
don
t
try
to
i
won
t
said
toad
i
was
only
thinking
if
i
might
sit
on
the
front
seat
there
beside
the
driver
where
i
could
get
the
fresh
air
full
in
my
face
i
should
soon
be
all
right
what
a
very
sensible
woman
said
the
gentleman
of
course
you
so
they
carefully
helped
toad
into
the
front
seat
beside
the
driver
and
on
they
went
again
toad
was
almost
himself
again
by
now
he
sat
up
looked
about
him
and
tried
to
beat
down
the
tremors
the
yearnings
the
old
cravings
that
rose
up
and
beset
him
and
took
possession
of
him
entirely
it
is
fate
he
said
to
himself
why
strive
why
struggle
and
he
turned
to
the
driver
at
his
side
please
sir
he
said
i
wish
you
would
kindly
let
me
try
and
drive
the
car
for
a
little
i
ve
been
watching
you
carefully
and
it
looks
so
easy
and
so
interesting
and
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
tell
my
friends
that
once
i
had
driven
a
the
driver
laughed
at
the
proposal
so
heartily
that
the
gentleman
inquired
what
the
matter
was
when
he
heard
he
said
to
toad
s
delight
bravo
ma
am
i
like
your
spirit
let
her
have
a
try
and
look
after
her
she
won
t
do
any
toad
eagerly
scrambled
into
the
seat
vacated
by
the
driver
took
the
in
his
hands
listened
with
affected
humility
to
the
instructions
given
him
and
set
the
car
in
motion
but
very
slowly
and
carefully
at
first
for
he
was
determined
to
be
prudent
the
gentlemen
behind
clapped
their
hands
and
applauded
and
toad
heard
them
saying
how
well
she
does
it
fancy
a
washerwoman
driving
a
car
as
well
as
that
the
first
time
toad
went
a
little
faster
then
faster
still
and
faster
he
heard
the
gentlemen
call
out
warningly
be
careful
washerwoman
and
this
annoyed
him
and
he
began
to
lose
his
head
the
driver
tried
to
interfere
but
he
pinned
him
down
in
his
seat
with
one
elbow
and
put
on
full
speed
the
rush
of
air
in
his
face
the
hum
of
the
engines
and
the
light
jump
of
the
car
beneath
him
intoxicated
his
weak
brain
washerwoman
indeed
he
shouted
recklessly
ho
ho
i
am
the
toad
the
snatcher
the
the
toad
who
always
escapes
sit
still
and
you
shall
know
what
driving
really
is
for
you
are
in
the
hands
of
the
famous
the
skilful
the
entirely
fearless
toad
with
a
cry
of
horror
the
whole
party
rose
and
flung
themselves
on
him
seize
him
they
cried
seize
the
toad
the
wicked
animal
who
stole
our
bind
him
chain
him
drag
him
to
the
nearest
down
with
the
desperate
and
dangerous
toad
alas
they
should
have
thought
they
ought
to
have
been
more
prudent
they
should
have
remembered
to
stop
the
somehow
before
playing
any
pranks
of
that
sort
with
a
of
the
wheel
the
toad
sent
the
car
crashing
through
the
low
hedge
that
ran
along
the
roadside
one
mighty
bound
a
violent
shock
and
the
wheels
of
the
car
were
churning
up
the
thick
mud
of
a
toad
found
himself
flying
through
the
air
with
the
strong
upward
rush
and
delicate
curve
of
a
swallow
he
liked
the
motion
and
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
whether
it
would
go
on
until
he
developed
wings
and
turned
into
a
when
he
landed
on
his
back
with
a
thump
in
the
soft
rich
grass
of
a
meadow
sitting
up
he
could
just
see
the
in
the
pond
nearly
submerged
the
gentlemen
and
the
driver
encumbered
by
their
long
coats
were
floundering
helplessly
in
the
water
he
picked
himself
up
rapidly
and
set
off
running
across
country
as
hard
as
he
could
scrambling
through
hedges
jumping
ditches
pounding
across
fields
till
he
was
breathless
and
weary
and
had
to
settle
down
into
an
easy
walk
when
he
had
recovered
his
breath
somewhat
and
was
able
to
think
calmly
he
began
to
giggle
and
from
giggling
he
took
to
laughing
and
he
laughed
till
he
had
to
sit
down
under
a
hedge
ho
ho
he
cried
in
ecstasies
of
toad
again
toad
as
usual
comes
out
on
the
top
who
was
it
got
them
to
give
him
a
lift
who
managed
to
get
on
the
front
seat
for
the
sake
of
fresh
air
who
persuaded
them
into
letting
him
see
if
he
could
drive
who
landed
them
all
in
a
who
escaped
flying
gaily
and
unscathed
through
the
air
leaving
the
grudging
timid
excursionists
in
the
mud
where
they
should
rightly
be
why
toad
of
course
clever
toad
great
toad
good
toad
then
he
burst
into
song
again
and
chanted
with
uplifted
voice
the
went
as
it
raced
along
the
road
who
was
it
steered
it
into
a
pond
ingenious
toad
o
how
clever
i
am
how
clever
how
clever
how
very
clev
a
slight
noise
at
a
distance
behind
him
made
him
turn
his
head
and
look
o
horror
o
misery
o
despair
about
two
fields
off
a
chauffeur
in
his
leather
gaiters
and
two
large
rural
policemen
were
visible
running
towards
him
as
hard
as
they
could
go
poor
toad
sprang
to
his
feet
and
pelted
away
again
his
heart
in
his
mouth
o
my
he
gasped
as
he
panted
along
what
an
ass
i
am
what
a
conceited
and
heedless
ass
swaggering
again
shouting
and
singing
songs
again
sitting
still
and
gassing
again
o
my
o
my
o
my
he
glanced
back
and
saw
to
his
dismay
that
they
were
gaining
on
him
on
he
ran
desperately
but
kept
looking
back
and
saw
that
they
still
gained
steadily
he
did
his
best
but
he
was
a
fat
animal
and
his
legs
were
short
and
still
they
gained
he
could
hear
them
close
behind
him
now
ceasing
to
heed
where
he
was
going
he
struggled
on
blindly
and
wildly
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
now
triumphant
enemy
when
suddenly
the
earth
failed
under
his
feet
he
grasped
at
the
air
and
splash
he
found
himself
head
over
ears
in
deep
water
rapid
water
water
that
bore
him
along
with
a
force
he
could
not
contend
with
and
he
knew
that
in
his
blind
panic
he
had
run
straight
into
the
river
he
rose
to
the
surface
and
tried
to
grasp
the
reeds
and
the
rushes
that
grew
along
the
water
s
edge
close
under
the
bank
but
the
stream
was
so
strong
that
it
tore
them
out
of
his
hands
o
my
gasped
poor
toad
if
ever
i
steal
a
again
if
ever
i
sing
another
conceited
song
then
down
he
went
and
came
up
breathless
and
spluttering
presently
he
saw
that
he
was
approaching
a
big
dark
hole
in
the
bank
just
above
his
head
and
as
the
stream
bore
him
past
he
reached
up
with
a
paw
and
caught
hold
of
the
edge
and
held
on
then
slowly
and
with
difficulty
he
drew
himself
up
out
of
the
water
till
at
last
he
was
able
to
rest
his
elbows
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
there
he
remained
for
some
minutes
puffing
and
panting
for
he
was
quite
exhausted
as
he
sighed
and
blew
and
stared
before
him
into
the
dark
hole
some
bright
small
thing
shone
and
twinkled
in
its
depths
moving
towards
him
as
it
approached
a
face
grew
up
gradually
around
it
and
it
was
a
familiar
face
brown
and
small
with
whiskers
grave
and
round
with
neat
ears
and
silky
hair
it
was
the
water
rat
xi
like
summer
tempests
came
his
tears
the
rat
put
out
a
neat
little
brown
paw
gripped
toad
firmly
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
gave
a
great
hoist
and
a
pull
and
the
toad
came
up
slowly
but
surely
over
the
edge
of
the
hole
till
at
last
he
stood
safe
and
sound
in
the
hall
streaked
with
mud
and
weed
to
be
sure
and
with
the
water
streaming
off
him
but
happy
and
as
of
old
now
that
he
found
himself
once
more
in
the
house
of
a
friend
and
dodgings
and
evasions
were
over
and
he
could
lay
aside
a
disguise
that
was
unworthy
of
his
position
and
wanted
such
a
lot
of
living
up
to
o
ratty
he
cried
i
ve
been
through
such
times
since
i
saw
you
last
you
can
t
think
such
trials
such
sufferings
and
all
so
nobly
borne
then
such
escapes
such
disguises
such
subterfuges
and
all
so
cleverly
planned
and
carried
out
been
in
prison
got
out
of
it
of
course
been
thrown
into
a
canal
swam
ashore
stole
a
horse
sold
him
for
a
large
sum
of
money
humbugged
everybody
made
em
all
do
exactly
what
i
wanted
oh
i
am
a
smart
toad
and
no
mistake
what
do
you
think
my
last
exploit
was
just
hold
on
till
i
tell
you
toad
said
the
water
rat
gravely
and
firmly
you
go
off
upstairs
at
once
and
take
off
that
old
cotton
rag
that
looks
as
if
it
might
formerly
have
belonged
to
some
washerwoman
and
clean
yourself
thoroughly
and
put
on
some
of
my
clothes
and
try
and
come
down
looking
like
a
gentleman
if
you
can
for
a
more
shabby
bedraggled
object
than
you
are
i
never
set
eyes
on
in
my
whole
life
now
stop
swaggering
and
arguing
and
be
off
i
ll
have
something
to
say
to
you
later
toad
was
at
first
inclined
to
stop
and
do
some
talking
back
at
him
he
had
had
enough
of
being
ordered
about
when
he
was
in
prison
and
here
was
the
thing
being
begun
all
over
again
apparently
and
by
a
rat
too
however
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
over
the
with
the
rusty
black
bonnet
perched
rakishly
over
one
eye
and
he
changed
his
mind
and
went
very
quickly
and
humbly
upstairs
to
the
rat
s
there
he
had
a
thorough
wash
and
changed
his
clothes
and
stood
for
a
long
time
before
the
glass
contemplating
himself
with
pride
and
pleasure
and
thinking
what
utter
idiots
all
the
people
must
have
been
to
have
ever
mistaken
him
for
one
moment
for
a
washerwoman
by
the
time
he
came
down
again
luncheon
was
on
the
table
and
very
glad
toad
was
to
see
it
for
he
had
been
through
some
trying
experiences
and
had
taken
much
hard
exercise
since
the
excellent
breakfast
provided
for
him
by
the
gipsy
while
they
ate
toad
told
the
rat
all
his
adventures
dwelling
chiefly
on
his
own
cleverness
and
presence
of
mind
in
emergencies
and
cunning
in
tight
places
and
rather
making
out
that
he
had
been
having
a
gay
and
experience
but
the
more
he
talked
and
boasted
the
more
grave
and
silent
the
rat
became
when
at
last
toad
had
talked
himself
to
a
standstill
there
was
silence
for
a
while
and
then
the
rat
said
now
toady
i
don
t
want
to
give
you
pain
after
all
you
ve
been
through
already
but
seriously
don
t
you
see
what
an
awful
ass
you
ve
been
making
of
yourself
on
your
own
admission
you
have
been
handcuffed
imprisoned
starved
chased
terrified
out
of
your
life
insulted
jeered
at
and
ignominiously
flung
into
the
water
by
a
woman
too
where
s
the
amusement
in
that
where
does
the
fun
come
in
and
all
because
you
must
needs
go
and
steal
a
you
know
that
you
ve
never
had
anything
but
trouble
from
from
the
moment
you
first
set
eyes
on
one
but
if
you
will
be
mixed
up
with
them
as
you
generally
are
five
minutes
after
you
ve
started
why
steal
them
be
a
cripple
if
you
think
it
s
exciting
be
a
bankrupt
for
a
change
if
you
ve
set
your
mind
on
it
but
why
choose
to
be
a
convict
when
are
you
going
to
be
sensible
and
think
of
your
friends
and
try
and
be
a
credit
to
them
do
you
suppose
it
s
any
pleasure
to
me
for
instance
to
hear
animals
saying
as
i
go
about
that
i
m
the
chap
that
keeps
company
with
now
it
was
a
very
comforting
point
in
toad
s
character
that
he
was
a
thoroughly
animal
and
never
minded
being
jawed
by
those
who
were
his
real
friends
and
even
when
most
set
upon
a
thing
he
was
always
able
to
see
the
other
side
of
the
question
so
although
while
the
rat
was
talking
so
seriously
he
kept
saying
to
himself
mutinously
but
it
was
fun
though
awful
fun
and
making
strange
suppressed
noises
inside
him
and
and
other
sounds
resembling
stifled
snorts
or
the
opening
of
bottles
yet
when
the
rat
had
quite
finished
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
very
nicely
and
humbly
quite
right
ratty
how
sound
you
always
are
yes
i
ve
been
a
conceited
old
ass
i
can
quite
see
that
but
now
i
m
going
to
be
a
good
toad
and
not
do
it
any
more
as
for
i
ve
not
been
at
all
so
keen
about
them
since
my
last
ducking
in
that
river
of
yours
the
fact
is
while
i
was
hanging
on
to
the
edge
of
your
hole
and
getting
my
breath
i
had
a
sudden
idea
a
really
brilliant
idea
connected
with
there
there
don
t
take
on
so
old
chap
and
stamp
and
upset
things
it
was
only
an
idea
and
we
won
t
talk
any
more
about
it
now
we
ll
have
our
coffee
and
a
smoke
and
a
quiet
chat
and
then
i
m
going
to
stroll
quietly
down
to
toad
hall
and
get
into
clothes
of
my
own
and
set
things
going
again
on
the
old
lines
i
ve
had
enough
of
adventures
i
shall
lead
a
quiet
steady
respectable
life
pottering
about
my
property
and
improving
it
and
doing
a
little
landscape
gardening
at
times
there
will
always
be
a
bit
of
dinner
for
my
friends
when
they
come
to
see
me
and
i
shall
keep
a
to
jog
about
the
country
in
just
as
i
used
to
in
the
good
old
days
before
i
got
restless
and
wanted
to
do
stroll
quietly
down
to
toad
hall
cried
the
rat
greatly
excited
what
are
you
talking
about
do
you
mean
to
say
you
haven
t
heard
heard
what
said
toad
turning
rather
pale
go
on
ratty
quick
don
t
spare
me
what
haven
t
i
heard
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
shouted
the
rat
thumping
with
his
little
fist
upon
the
table
that
you
ve
heard
nothing
about
the
stoats
and
weasels
what
the
wild
wooders
cried
toad
trembling
in
every
limb
no
not
a
word
what
have
they
been
doing
and
how
they
ve
been
and
taken
toad
hall
continued
the
rat
toad
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
chin
on
his
paws
and
a
large
tear
welled
up
in
each
of
his
eyes
overflowed
and
splashed
on
the
table
plop
plop
go
on
ratty
he
murmured
presently
tell
me
all
the
worst
is
over
i
am
an
animal
again
i
can
bear
when
you
got
into
that
that
trouble
of
yours
said
the
rat
slowly
and
impressively
i
mean
when
you
disappeared
from
society
for
a
time
over
that
misunderstanding
about
a
a
machine
you
know
toad
merely
nodded
well
it
was
a
good
deal
talked
about
down
here
naturally
continued
the
rat
not
only
along
the
but
even
in
the
wild
wood
animals
took
sides
as
always
happens
the
stuck
up
for
you
and
said
you
had
been
infamously
treated
and
there
was
no
justice
to
be
had
in
the
land
nowadays
but
the
wild
wood
animals
said
hard
things
and
served
you
right
and
it
was
time
this
sort
of
thing
was
stopped
and
they
got
very
cocky
and
went
about
saying
you
were
done
for
this
time
you
would
never
come
back
again
never
never
toad
nodded
once
more
keeping
silence
that
s
the
sort
of
little
beasts
they
are
the
rat
went
on
but
mole
and
badger
they
stuck
out
through
thick
and
thin
that
you
would
come
back
again
soon
somehow
they
didn
t
know
exactly
how
but
somehow
toad
began
to
sit
up
in
his
chair
again
and
to
smirk
a
little
they
argued
from
history
continued
the
rat
they
said
that
no
criminal
laws
had
ever
been
known
to
prevail
against
cheek
and
plausibility
such
as
yours
combined
with
the
power
of
a
long
purse
so
they
arranged
to
move
their
things
in
to
toad
hall
and
sleep
there
and
keep
it
aired
and
have
it
all
ready
for
you
when
you
turned
up
they
didn
t
guess
what
was
going
to
happen
of
course
still
they
had
their
suspicions
of
the
wild
wood
animals
now
i
come
to
the
most
painful
and
tragic
part
of
my
story
one
dark
night
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
blowing
hard
too
and
raining
simply
cats
and
dogs
a
band
of
weasels
armed
to
the
teeth
crept
silently
up
the
to
the
front
entrance
simultaneously
a
body
of
desperate
ferrets
advancing
through
the
possessed
themselves
of
the
backyard
and
offices
while
a
company
of
skirmishing
stoats
who
stuck
at
nothing
occupied
the
conservatory
and
the
and
held
the
french
windows
opening
on
to
the
lawn
the
mole
and
the
badger
were
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
telling
stories
and
suspecting
nothing
for
it
wasn
t
a
night
for
any
animals
to
be
out
in
when
those
bloodthirsty
villains
broke
down
the
doors
and
rushed
in
upon
them
from
every
side
they
made
the
best
fight
they
could
but
what
was
the
good
they
were
unarmed
and
taken
by
surprise
and
what
can
two
animals
do
against
hundreds
they
took
and
beat
them
severely
with
sticks
those
two
poor
faithful
creatures
and
turned
them
out
into
the
cold
and
the
wet
with
many
insulting
and
remarks
here
the
unfeeling
toad
broke
into
a
snigger
and
then
pulled
himself
together
and
tried
to
look
particularly
solemn
and
the
wild
wooders
have
been
living
in
toad
hall
ever
since
continued
the
rat
and
going
on
simply
anyhow
lying
in
bed
half
the
day
and
breakfast
at
all
hours
and
the
place
in
such
a
mess
i
m
told
it
s
not
fit
to
be
seen
eating
your
grub
and
drinking
your
drink
and
making
bad
jokes
about
you
and
singing
vulgar
songs
about
well
about
prisons
and
magistrates
and
policemen
horrid
personal
songs
with
no
humour
in
them
and
they
re
telling
the
tradespeople
and
everybody
that
they
ve
come
to
stay
for
o
have
they
said
toad
getting
up
and
seizing
a
stick
i
ll
jolly
soon
see
about
that
it
s
no
good
toad
called
the
rat
after
him
you
d
better
come
back
and
sit
down
you
ll
only
get
into
but
the
toad
was
off
and
there
was
no
holding
him
he
marched
rapidly
down
the
road
his
stick
over
his
shoulder
fuming
and
muttering
to
himself
in
his
anger
till
he
got
near
his
front
gate
when
suddenly
there
popped
up
from
behind
the
palings
a
long
yellow
ferret
with
a
gun
who
comes
there
said
the
ferret
sharply
stuff
and
nonsense
said
toad
very
angrily
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
like
that
to
me
come
out
of
that
at
once
or
i
ll
the
ferret
said
never
a
word
but
he
brought
his
gun
up
to
his
shoulder
toad
prudently
dropped
flat
in
the
road
and
bang
a
bullet
whistled
over
his
head
the
startled
toad
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
scampered
off
down
the
road
as
hard
as
he
could
and
as
he
ran
he
heard
the
ferret
laughing
and
other
horrid
thin
little
laughs
taking
it
up
and
carrying
on
the
sound
he
went
back
very
crestfallen
and
told
the
water
rat
what
did
i
tell
you
said
the
rat
it
s
no
good
they
ve
got
sentries
posted
and
they
are
all
armed
you
must
just
still
toad
was
not
inclined
to
give
in
all
at
once
so
he
got
out
the
boat
and
set
off
rowing
up
the
river
to
where
the
garden
front
of
toad
hall
came
down
to
the
waterside
arriving
within
sight
of
his
old
home
he
rested
on
his
oars
and
surveyed
the
land
cautiously
all
seemed
very
peaceful
and
deserted
and
quiet
he
could
see
the
whole
front
of
toad
hall
glowing
in
the
evening
sunshine
the
pigeons
settling
by
twos
and
threes
along
the
straight
line
of
the
roof
the
garden
a
blaze
of
flowers
the
creek
that
led
up
to
the
the
little
wooden
bridge
that
crossed
it
all
tranquil
uninhabited
apparently
waiting
for
his
return
he
would
try
the
first
he
thought
very
warily
he
paddled
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
was
just
passing
under
the
bridge
when
crash
a
great
stone
dropped
from
above
smashed
through
the
bottom
of
the
boat
it
filled
and
sank
and
toad
found
himself
struggling
in
deep
water
looking
up
he
saw
two
stoats
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
watching
him
with
great
glee
it
will
be
your
head
next
time
toady
they
called
out
to
him
the
indignant
toad
swam
to
shore
while
the
stoats
laughed
and
laughed
supporting
each
other
and
laughed
again
till
they
nearly
had
two
fits
that
is
one
fit
each
of
course
the
toad
retraced
his
weary
way
on
foot
and
related
his
disappointing
experiences
to
the
water
rat
once
more
well
what
did
i
tell
you
said
the
rat
very
crossly
and
now
look
here
see
what
you
ve
been
and
done
lost
me
my
boat
that
i
was
so
fond
of
that
s
what
you
ve
done
and
simply
ruined
that
nice
suit
of
clothes
that
i
lent
you
really
toad
of
all
the
trying
animals
i
wonder
you
manage
to
keep
any
friends
at
all
the
toad
saw
at
once
how
wrongly
and
foolishly
he
had
acted
he
admitted
his
errors
and
and
made
a
full
apology
to
rat
for
losing
his
boat
and
spoiling
his
clothes
and
he
wound
up
by
saying
with
that
frank
which
always
disarmed
his
friend
s
criticism
and
won
them
back
to
his
side
ratty
i
see
that
i
have
been
a
headstrong
and
a
wilful
toad
henceforth
believe
me
i
will
be
humble
and
submissive
and
will
take
no
action
without
your
kind
advice
and
full
approval
if
that
is
really
so
said
the
rat
already
appeased
then
my
advice
to
you
is
considering
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
sit
down
and
have
your
supper
which
will
be
on
the
table
in
a
minute
and
be
very
patient
for
i
am
convinced
that
we
can
do
nothing
until
we
have
seen
the
mole
and
the
badger
and
heard
their
latest
news
and
held
conference
and
taken
their
advice
in
this
difficult
oh
ah
yes
of
course
the
mole
and
the
badger
said
toad
lightly
what
s
become
of
them
the
dear
fellows
i
had
forgotten
all
about
well
may
you
ask
said
the
rat
reproachfully
while
you
were
riding
about
the
country
in
expensive
and
galloping
proudly
on
and
breakfasting
on
the
fat
of
the
land
those
two
poor
devoted
animals
have
been
camping
out
in
the
open
in
every
sort
of
weather
living
very
rough
by
day
and
lying
very
hard
by
night
watching
over
your
house
patrolling
your
boundaries
keeping
a
constant
eye
on
the
stoats
and
the
weasels
scheming
and
planning
and
contriving
how
to
get
your
property
back
for
you
you
don
t
deserve
to
have
such
true
and
loyal
friends
toad
you
don
t
really
some
day
when
it
s
too
late
you
ll
be
sorry
you
didn
t
value
them
more
while
you
had
them
i
m
an
ungrateful
beast
i
know
sobbed
toad
shedding
bitter
tears
let
me
go
out
and
find
them
out
into
the
cold
dark
night
and
share
their
hardships
and
try
and
prove
by
hold
on
a
bit
surely
i
heard
the
chink
of
dishes
on
a
tray
supper
s
here
at
last
hooray
come
on
ratty
the
rat
remembered
that
poor
toad
had
been
on
prison
fare
for
a
considerable
time
and
that
large
allowances
had
therefore
to
be
made
he
followed
him
to
the
table
accordingly
and
hospitably
encouraged
him
in
his
gallant
efforts
to
make
up
for
past
privations
they
had
just
finished
their
meal
and
resumed
their
when
there
came
a
heavy
knock
at
the
door
toad
was
nervous
but
the
rat
nodding
mysteriously
at
him
went
straight
up
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
in
walked
badger
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
one
who
for
some
nights
had
been
kept
away
from
home
and
all
its
little
comforts
and
conveniences
his
shoes
were
covered
with
mud
and
he
was
looking
very
rough
and
touzled
but
then
he
had
never
been
a
very
smart
man
the
badger
at
the
best
of
times
he
came
solemnly
up
to
toad
shook
him
by
the
paw
and
said
welcome
home
toad
alas
what
am
i
saying
home
indeed
this
is
a
poor
unhappy
toad
then
he
turned
his
back
on
him
sat
down
to
the
table
drew
his
chair
up
and
helped
himself
to
a
large
slice
of
cold
pie
toad
was
quite
alarmed
at
this
very
serious
and
portentous
style
of
greeting
but
the
rat
whispered
to
him
never
mind
don
t
take
any
notice
and
don
t
say
anything
to
him
just
yet
he
s
always
rather
low
and
despondent
when
he
s
wanting
his
victuals
in
half
an
hour
s
time
he
ll
be
quite
a
different
so
they
waited
in
silence
and
presently
there
came
another
and
a
lighter
knock
the
rat
with
a
nod
to
toad
went
to
the
door
and
ushered
in
the
mole
very
shabby
and
unwashed
with
bits
of
hay
and
straw
sticking
in
his
fur
hooray
here
s
old
toad
cried
the
mole
his
face
beaming
fancy
having
you
back
again
and
he
began
to
dance
round
him
we
never
dreamt
you
would
turn
up
so
soon
why
you
must
have
managed
to
escape
you
clever
ingenious
intelligent
toad
the
rat
alarmed
pulled
him
by
the
elbow
but
it
was
too
late
toad
was
puffing
and
swelling
already
clever
o
no
he
said
i
m
not
really
clever
according
to
my
friends
i
ve
only
broken
out
of
the
strongest
prison
in
england
that
s
all
and
captured
a
railway
train
and
escaped
on
it
that
s
all
and
disguised
myself
and
gone
about
the
country
humbugging
everybody
that
s
all
o
no
i
m
a
stupid
ass

am
i
ll
tell
you
one
or
two
of
my
little
adventures

you
shall
judge
for
yourself
well

said
the
mole
moving
towards
the
supposing
you
talk
while
i
eat
not
a
bite
since
breakfast
o
my
o
my
and
he
sat
down
and
helped
himself
liberally
to
cold
beef
and
pickles
toad
straddled
on
the
thrust
his
paw
into
his
and
pulled
out
a
handful
of
silver
look
at
that
he
cried
displaying
it
that
s
not
so
bad
is
it
for
a
few
minutes
work
and
how
do
you
think
i
done
it
mole
that
s
how
i
done
it
go
on
toad
said
the
mole
immensely
interested
toad
do
be
quiet
please
said
the
rat
and
don
t
you
egg
him
on
mole
when
you
know
what
he
is
but
please
tell
us
as
soon
as
possible
what
the
position
is
and
what
s
best
to
be
done
now
that
toad
is
back
at
the
position
s
about
as
bad
as
it
can
be
replied
the
mole
grumpily
and
as
for
what
s
to
be
done
why
blest
if
i
know
the
badger
and
i
have
been
round
and
round
the
place
by
night
and
by
day
always
the
same
thing
sentries
posted
everywhere
guns
poked
out
at
us
stones
thrown
at
us
always
an
animal
on
the
and
when
they
see
us
my
how
they
do
laugh
that
s
what
annoys
me
most
it
s
a
very
difficult
situation
said
the
rat
reflecting
deeply
but
i
think
i
see
now
in
the
depths
of
my
mind
what
toad
really
ought
to
do
i
will
tell
you
he
ought
to
no
he
oughtn
t
shouted
the
mole
with
his
mouth
full
nothing
of
the
sort
you
don
t
understand
what
he
ought
to
do
is
he
ought
to
well
i
shan
t
do
it
anyway
cried
toad
getting
excited
i
m
not
going
to
be
ordered
about
by
you
fellows
it
s
my
house
we
re
talking
about
and
i
know
exactly
what
to
do
and
i
ll
tell
you
i
m
going
to
by
this
time
they
were
all
three
talking
at
once
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
the
noise
was
simply
deafening
when
a
thin
dry
voice
made
itself
heard
saying
be
quiet
at
once
all
of
you
and
instantly
every
one
was
silent
it
was
the
badger
who
having
finished
his
pie
had
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
was
looking
at
them
severely
when
he
saw
that
he
had
secured
their
attention
and
that
they
were
evidently
waiting
for
him
to
address
them
he
turned
back
to
the
table
again
and
reached
out
for
the
cheese
and
so
great
was
the
respect
commanded
by
the
solid
qualities
of
that
admirable
animal
that
not
another
word
was
uttered
until
he
had
quite
finished
his
repast
and
brushed
the
crumbs
from
his
knees
the
toad
fidgeted
a
good
deal
but
the
rat
held
him
firmly
down
when
the
badger
had
quite
done
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
stood
before
the
fireplace
reflecting
deeply
at
last
he
spoke
toad
he
said
severely
you
bad
troublesome
little
animal
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
what
do
you
think
your
father
my
old
friend
would
have
said
if
he
had
been
here
and
had
known
of
all
your
goings
on
toad
who
was
on
the
sofa
by
this
time
with
his
legs
up
rolled
over
on
his
face
shaken
by
sobs
of
contrition
there
there
went
on
the
badger
more
kindly
never
mind
stop
crying
we
re
going
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
try
and
turn
over
a
new
leaf
but
what
the
mole
says
is
quite
true
the
stoats
are
on
guard
at
every
point
and
they
make
the
best
sentinels
in
the
world
it
s
quite
useless
to
think
of
attacking
the
place
they
re
too
strong
for
then
it
s
all
over
sobbed
the
toad
crying
into
the
sofa
cushions
i
shall
go
and
enlist
for
a
soldier
and
never
see
my
dear
toad
hall
any
more
come
cheer
up
toady
said
the
badger
there
are
more
ways
of
getting
back
a
place
than
taking
it
by
storm
i
haven
t
said
my
last
word
yet
now
i
m
going
to
tell
you
a
great
toad
sat
up
slowly
and
dried
his
eyes
secrets
had
an
immense
attraction
for
him
because
he
never
could
keep
one
and
he
enjoyed
the
sort
of
unhallowed
thrill
he
experienced
when
he
went
and
told
another
animal
after
having
faithfully
promised
not
to
there
is
an
underground
passage
said
the
badger
impressively
that
leads
from
the
quite
near
here
right
up
into
the
middle
of
toad
o
nonsense
badger
said
toad
rather
airily
you
ve
been
listening
to
some
of
the
yarns
they
spin
in
the
about
here
i
know
every
inch
of
toad
hall
inside
and
out
nothing
of
the
sort
i
do
assure
you
my
young
friend
said
the
badger
with
great
severity
your
father
who
was
a
worthy
animal
a
lot
worthier
than
some
others
i
know
was
a
particular
friend
of
mine
and
told
me
a
great
deal
he
wouldn
t
have
dreamt
of
telling
you
he
discovered
that
passage
he
didn
t
make
it
of
course
that
was
done
hundreds
of
years
before
he
ever
came
to
live
there
and
he
repaired
it
and
cleaned
it
out
because
he
thought
it
might
come
in
useful
some
day
in
case
of
trouble
or
danger
and
he
showed
it
to
me
don
t
let
my
son
know
about
it
he
said
he
s
a
good
boy
but
very
light
and
volatile
in
character
and
simply
can
not
hold
his
tongue
if
he
s
ever
in
a
real
fix
and
it
would
be
of
use
to
him
you
may
tell
him
about
the
secret
passage
but
not
the
other
animals
looked
hard
at
toad
to
see
how
he
would
take
it
toad
was
inclined
to
be
sulky
at
first
but
he
brightened
up
immediately
like
the
good
fellow
he
was
well
well
he
said
perhaps
i
am
a
bit
of
a
talker
a
popular
fellow
such
as
i
am
my
friends
get
round
me
we
chaff
we
sparkle
we
tell
witty
stories
and
somehow
my
tongue
gets
wagging
i
have
the
gift
of
conversation
i
ve
been
told
i
ought
to
have
a
salon
whatever
that
may
be
never
mind
go
on
badger
how
s
this
passage
of
yours
going
to
help
us
i
ve
found
out
a
thing
or
two
lately
continued
the
badger
i
got
otter
to
disguise
himself
as
a
sweep
and
call
at
the
with
brushes
over
his
shoulder
asking
for
a
job
there
s
going
to
be
a
big
banquet
night
it
s
somebody
s
birthday
the
chief
weasel
s
i
believe
and
all
the
weasels
will
be
gathered
together
in
the
eating
and
drinking
and
laughing
and
carrying
on
suspecting
nothing
no
guns
no
swords
no
sticks
no
arms
of
any
sort
whatever
but
the
sentinels
will
be
posted
as
usual
remarked
the
rat
exactly
said
the
badger
that
is
my
point
the
weasels
will
trust
entirely
to
their
excellent
sentinels
and
that
is
where
the
passage
comes
in
that
very
useful
tunnel
leads
right
up
under
the
butler
s
pantry
next
to
the
aha
that
squeaky
board
in
the
butler
s
pantry
said
toad
now
i
understand
it
we
shall
creep
out
quietly
into
the
butler
s
pantry
cried
the
mole
with
our
pistols
and
swords
and
sticks
shouted
the
rat
and
rush
in
upon
them
said
the
badger
and
whack
em
and
whack
em
and
whack
em
cried
the
toad
in
ecstasy
running
round
and
round
the
room
and
jumping
over
the
chairs
very
well
then
said
the
badger
resuming
his
usual
dry
manner
our
plan
is
settled
and
there
s
nothing
more
for
you
to
argue
and
squabble
about
so
as
it
s
getting
very
late
all
of
you
go
right
off
to
bed
at
once
we
will
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
in
the
course
of
the
morning
toad
of
course
went
off
to
bed
dutifully
with
the
rest
he
knew
better
than
to
refuse
though
he
was
feeling
much
too
excited
to
sleep
but
he
had
had
a
long
day
with
many
events
crowded
into
it
and
sheets
and
blankets
were
very
friendly
and
comforting
things
after
plain
straw
and
not
too
much
of
it
spread
on
the
stone
floor
of
a
draughty
cell
and
his
head
had
not
been
many
seconds
on
his
pillow
before
he
was
snoring
happily
naturally
he
dreamt
a
good
deal
about
roads
that
ran
away
from
him
just
when
he
wanted
them
and
canals
that
chased
him
and
caught
him
and
a
barge
that
sailed
into
the
with
his
week
s
washing
just
as
he
was
giving
a
and
he
was
alone
in
the
secret
passage
pushing
onwards
but
it
twisted
and
turned
round
and
shook
itself
and
sat
up
on
its
end
yet
somehow
at
the
last
he
found
himself
back
in
toad
hall
safe
and
triumphant
with
all
his
friends
gathered
round
about
him
earnestly
assuring
him
that
he
really
was
a
clever
toad
he
slept
till
a
late
hour
next
morning
and
by
the
time
he
got
down
he
found
that
the
other
animals
had
finished
their
breakfast
some
time
before
the
mole
had
slipped
off
somewhere
by
himself
without
telling
any
one
where
he
was
going
to
the
badger
sat
in
the
reading
the
paper
and
not
concerning
himself
in
the
slightest
about
what
was
going
to
happen
that
very
evening
the
rat
on
the
other
hand
was
running
round
the
room
busily
with
his
arms
full
of
weapons
of
every
kind
distributing
them
in
four
little
heaps
on
the
floor
and
saying
excitedly
under
his
breath
as
he
ran
here
here
mole
here
here
here
here
here
here
and
so
on
in
a
regular
rhythmical
way
while
the
four
little
heaps
gradually
grew
and
grew
that
s
all
very
well
rat
said
the
badger
presently
looking
at
the
busy
little
animal
over
the
edge
of
his
newspaper
i
m
not
blaming
you
but
just
let
us
once
get
past
the
stoats
with
those
detestable
guns
of
theirs
and
i
assure
you
we
shan
t
want
any
swords
or
pistols
we
four
with
our
sticks
once
we
re
inside
the
why
we
shall
clear
the
floor
of
all
the
lot
of
them
in
five
minutes
i
d
have
done
the
whole
thing
by
myself
only
i
didn
t
want
to
deprive
you
fellows
of
the
fun
it
s
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
said
the
rat
reflectively
polishing
a
on
his
sleeve
and
looking
along
it
the
toad
having
finished
his
breakfast
picked
up
a
stout
stick
and
swung
it
vigorously
belabouring
imaginary
animals
i
ll
learn
em
to
steal
my
house
he
cried
i
ll
learn
em
i
ll
learn
em
don
t
say
learn
em
toad
said
the
rat
greatly
shocked
it
s
not
good
what
are
you
always
nagging
at
toad
for
inquired
the
badger
rather
peevishly
what
s
the
matter
with
his
english
it
s
the
same
what
i
use
myself
and
if
it
s
good
enough
for
me
it
ought
to
be
good
enough
for
you
i
m
very
sorry
said
the
rat
humbly
only
i
think
it
ought
to
be
teach
em
not
learn
but
we
don
t
want
to
teach
em
replied
the
badger
we
want
to
learn
em
learn
em
learn
em
and
what
s
more
we
re
going
to
do
it
too
oh
very
well
have
it
your
own
way
said
the
rat
he
was
getting
rather
muddled
about
it
himself
and
presently
he
retired
into
a
corner
where
he
could
be
heard
muttering
learn
em
teach
em
teach
em
learn
em
till
the
badger
told
him
rather
sharply
to
leave
off
presently
the
mole
came
tumbling
into
the
room
evidently
very
pleased
with
himself
i
ve
been
having
such
fun
he
began
at
once
i
ve
been
getting
a
rise
out
of
the
stoats
i
hope
you
ve
been
very
careful
mole
said
the
rat
anxiously
i
should
hope
so
too
said
the
mole
confidently
i
got
the
idea
when
i
went
into
the
kitchen
to
see
about
toad
s
breakfast
being
kept
hot
for
him
i
found
that
old
that
he
came
home
in
yesterday
hanging
on
a
before
the
fire
so
i
put
it
on
and
the
bonnet
as
well
and
the
shawl
and
off
i
went
to
toad
hall
as
bold
as
you
please
the
sentries
were
on
the
of
course
with
their
guns
and
their
who
comes
there
and
all
the
rest
of
their
nonsense
good
morning
gentlemen
says
i
very
respectful
want
any
washing
done
they
looked
at
me
very
proud
and
stiff
and
haughty
and
said
go
away
washerwoman
we
don
t
do
any
washing
on
or
any
other
time
says
ho
ho
ho
wasn
t
i
funny
toad
poor
frivolous
animal
said
toad
very
loftily
the
fact
is
he
felt
exceedingly
jealous
of
mole
for
what
he
had
just
done
it
was
exactly
what
he
would
have
liked
to
have
done
himself
if
only
he
had
thought
of
it
first
and
hadn
t
gone
and
overslept
himself
some
of
the
stoats
turned
quite
pink
continued
the
mole
and
the
sergeant
in
charge
he
said
to
me
very
short
he
said
now
run
away
my
good
woman
run
away
don
t
keep
my
men
idling
and
talking
on
their
run
away
says
i
it
won
t
be
me
that
ll
be
running
away
in
a
very
short
time
from
now
o
moly
how
could
you
said
the
rat
dismayed
the
badger
laid
down
his
paper
i
could
see
them
pricking
up
their
ears
and
looking
at
each
other
went
on
the
mole
and
the
sergeant
said
to
them
never
mind
her
she
doesn
t
know
what
she
s
talking
o
don
t
i
said
i
well
let
me
tell
you
this
my
daughter
she
washes
for
badger
and
that
ll
show
you
whether
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
and
you
ll
know
pretty
soon
too
a
hundred
bloodthirsty
badgers
armed
with
rifles
are
going
to
attack
toad
hall
this
very
night
by
way
of
the
paddock
six
boatloads
of
rats
with
pistols
and
cutlasses
will
come
up
the
river
and
effect
a
landing
in
the
garden
while
a
picked
body
of
toads
known
at
the
or
the
toads
will
storm
the
orchard
and
carry
everything
before
them
yelling
for
vengeance
there
won
t
be
much
left
of
you
to
wash
by
the
time
they
ve
done
with
you
unless
you
clear
out
while
you
have
the
chance
then
i
ran
away
and
when
i
was
out
of
sight
i
hid
and
presently
i
came
creeping
back
along
the
ditch
and
took
a
peep
at
them
through
the
hedge
they
were
all
as
nervous
and
flustered
as
could
be
running
all
ways
at
once
and
falling
over
each
other
and
every
one
giving
orders
to
everybody
else
and
not
listening
and
the
sergeant
kept
sending
off
parties
of
stoats
to
distant
parts
of
the
grounds
and
then
sending
other
fellows
to
fetch
em
back
again
and
i
heard
them
saying
to
each
other
that
s
just
like
the
weasels
they
re
to
stop
comfortably
in
the
and
have
feasting
and
toasts
and
songs
and
all
sorts
of
fun
while
we
must
stay
on
guard
in
the
cold
and
the
dark
and
in
the
end
be
cut
to
pieces
by
bloodthirsty
badgers
oh
you
silly
ass
mole
cried
toad
you
ve
been
and
spoilt
everything
mole
said
the
badger
in
his
dry
quiet
way
i
perceive
you
have
more
sense
in
your
little
finger
than
some
other
animals
have
in
the
whole
of
their
fat
bodies
you
have
managed
excellently
and
i
begin
to
have
great
hopes
of
you
good
mole
clever
mole
the
toad
was
simply
wild
with
jealousy
more
especially
as
he
couldn
t
make
out
for
the
life
of
him
what
the
mole
had
done
that
was
so
particularly
clever
but
fortunately
for
him
before
he
could
show
temper
or
expose
himself
to
the
badger
s
sarcasm
the
bell
rang
for
luncheon
it
was
a
simple
but
sustaining
meal
bacon
and
broad
beans
and
a
macaroni
pudding
and
when
they
had
quite
done
the
badger
settled
himself
into
an
and
said
well
we
ve
got
our
work
cut
out
for
us
and
it
will
probably
be
pretty
late
before
we
re
quite
through
with
it
so
i
m
just
going
to
take
forty
winks
while
i
and
he
drew
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
and
was
soon
snoring
the
anxious
and
laborious
rat
at
once
resumed
his
preparations
and
started
running
between
his
four
little
heaps
muttering
here
here
here
here
and
so
on
with
every
fresh
accoutrement
he
produced
to
which
there
seemed
really
no
end
so
the
mole
drew
his
arm
through
toad
s
led
him
out
into
the
open
air
shoved
him
into
a
wicker
chair
and
made
him
tell
him
all
his
adventures
from
beginning
to
end
which
toad
was
only
too
willing
to
do
the
mole
was
a
good
listener
and
toad
with
no
one
to
check
his
statements
or
to
criticise
in
an
unfriendly
spirit
rather
let
himself
go
indeed
much
that
he
related
belonged
more
properly
to
the
category
of
those
are
always
the
best
and
the
raciest
adventures
and
why
should
they
not
be
truly
ours
as
much
as
the
somewhat
inadequate
things
that
really
come
off
xii
the
return
of
ulysses
when
it
began
to
grow
dark
the
rat
with
an
air
of
excitement
and
mystery
summoned
them
back
into
the
parlour
stood
each
of
them
up
alongside
of
his
little
heap
and
proceeded
to
dress
them
up
for
the
coming
expedition
he
was
very
earnest
and
thoroughgoing
about
it
and
the
affair
took
quite
a
long
time
first
there
was
a
belt
to
go
round
each
animal
and
then
a
sword
to
be
stuck
into
each
belt
and
then
a
cutlass
on
the
other
side
to
balance
it
then
a
pair
of
pistols
a
policeman
s
truncheon
several
sets
of
handcuffs
some
bandages
and
and
a
flask
and
a
the
badger
laughed
and
said
all
right
ratty
it
amuses
you
and
it
doesn
t
hurt
me
i
m
going
to
do
all
i
ve
got
to
do
with
this
here
but
the
rat
only
said
please
badger
you
know
i
shouldn
t
like
you
to
blame
me
afterwards
and
say
i
had
forgotten
anything
when
all
was
quite
ready
the
badger
took
a
dark
lantern
in
one
paw
grasped
his
great
stick
with
the
other
and
said
now
then
follow
me
mole
first
cos
i
m
very
pleased
with
him
rat
next
toad
last
and
look
here
toady
don
t
you
chatter
so
much
as
usual
or
you
ll
be
sent
back
as
sure
as
fate
the
toad
was
so
anxious
not
to
be
left
out
that
he
took
up
the
inferior
position
assigned
to
him
without
a
murmur
and
the
animals
set
off
the
badger
led
them
along
by
the
river
for
a
little
way
and
then
suddenly
swung
himself
over
the
edge
into
a
hole
in
the
a
little
above
the
water
the
mole
and
the
rat
followed
silently
swinging
themselves
successfully
into
the
hole
as
they
had
seen
the
badger
do
but
when
it
came
to
toad
s
turn
of
course
he
managed
to
slip
and
fall
into
the
water
with
a
loud
splash
and
a
squeal
of
alarm
he
was
hauled
out
by
his
friends
rubbed
down
and
wrung
out
hastily
comforted
and
set
on
his
legs
but
the
badger
was
seriously
angry
and
told
him
that
the
very
next
time
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
he
would
most
certainly
be
left
behind
so
at
last
they
were
in
the
secret
passage
and
the
expedition
had
really
begun
it
was
cold
and
dark
and
damp
and
low
and
narrow
and
poor
toad
began
to
shiver
partly
from
dread
of
what
might
be
before
him
partly
because
he
was
wet
through
the
lantern
was
far
ahead
and
he
could
not
help
lagging
behind
a
little
in
the
darkness
then
he
heard
the
rat
call
out
warningly
come
on
toad
and
a
terror
seized
him
of
being
left
behind
alone
in
the
darkness
and
he
came
on
with
such
a
rush
that
he
upset
the
rat
into
the
mole
and
the
mole
into
the
badger
and
for
a
moment
all
was
confusion
the
badger
thought
they
were
being
attacked
from
behind
and
as
there
was
no
room
to
use
a
stick
or
a
cutlass
drew
a
pistol
and
was
on
the
point
of
putting
a
bullet
into
toad
when
he
found
out
what
had
really
happened
he
was
very
angry
indeed
and
said
now
this
time
that
tiresome
toad
shall
be
left
behind
but
toad
whimpered
and
the
other
two
promised
that
they
would
be
answerable
for
his
good
conduct
and
at
last
the
badger
was
pacified
and
the
procession
moved
on
only
this
time
the
rat
brought
up
the
rear
with
a
firm
grip
on
the
shoulder
of
toad
so
they
groped
and
shuffled
along
with
their
ears
pricked
up
and
their
paws
on
their
pistols
till
at
last
the
badger
said
we
ought
by
now
to
be
pretty
nearly
under
the
then
suddenly
they
heard
far
away
as
it
might
be
and
yet
apparently
nearly
over
their
heads
a
confused
murmur
of
sound
as
if
people
were
shouting
and
cheering
and
stamping
on
the
floor
and
hammering
on
tables
the
toad
s
nervous
terrors
all
returned
but
the
badger
only
remarked
placidly
they
are
going
it
the
weasels
the
passage
now
began
to
slope
upwards
they
groped
onward
a
little
further
and
then
the
noise
broke
out
again
quite
distinct
this
time
and
very
close
above
them
they
heard
and
the
stamping
of
little
feet
on
the
floor
and
the
clinking
of
glasses
as
little
fists
pounded
on
the
table
what
a
time
they
re
having
said
the
badger
come
on
they
hurried
along
the
passage
till
it
came
to
a
full
stop
and
they
found
themselves
standing
under
the
that
led
up
into
the
butler
s
pantry
such
a
tremendous
noise
was
going
on
in
the
that
there
was
little
danger
of
their
being
overheard
the
badger
said
now
boys
all
together
and
the
four
of
them
put
their
shoulders
to
the
and
heaved
it
back
hoisting
each
other
up
they
found
themselves
standing
in
the
pantry
with
only
a
door
between
them
and
the
where
their
unconscious
enemies
were
carousing
the
noise
as
they
emerged
from
the
passage
was
simply
deafening
at
last
as
the
cheering
and
hammering
slowly
subsided
a
voice
could
be
made
out
saying
well
i
do
not
propose
to
detain
you
much
longer
great
applause
but
before
i
resume
my
seat
renewed
cheering
i
should
like
to
say
one
word
about
our
kind
host
toad
we
all
know
toad
great
laughter
good
toad
modest
toad
honest
toad
shrieks
of
merriment
only
just
let
me
get
at
him
muttered
toad
grinding
his
teeth
hold
hard
a
minute
said
the
badger
restraining
him
with
difficulty
get
ready
all
of
you
let
me
sing
you
a
little
song
went
on
the
voice
which
i
have
composed
on
the
subject
of
toad
prolonged
applause
then
the
chief
weasel
for
it
was
he
began
in
a
high
squeaky
voice
toad
he
went
gaily
down
the
street
the
badger
drew
himself
up
took
a
firm
grip
of
his
stick
with
both
paws
glanced
round
at
his
comrades
and
cried
the
hour
is
come
follow
me
and
flung
the
door
open
wide
my
what
a
squealing
and
a
squeaking
and
a
screeching
filled
the
air
well
might
the
terrified
weasels
dive
under
the
tables
and
spring
madly
up
at
the
windows
well
might
the
ferrets
rush
wildly
for
the
fireplace
and
get
hopelessly
jammed
in
the
chimney
well
might
tables
and
chairs
be
upset
and
glass
and
china
be
sent
crashing
on
the
floor
in
the
panic
of
that
terrible
moment
when
the
four
heroes
strode
wrathfully
into
the
room
the
mighty
badger
his
whiskers
bristling
his
great
cudgel
whistling
through
the
air
mole
black
and
grim
brandishing
his
stick
and
shouting
his
awful
a
mole
a
mole
rat
desperate
and
determined
his
belt
bulging
with
weapons
of
every
age
and
every
variety
toad
frenzied
with
excitement
and
injured
pride
swollen
to
twice
his
ordinary
size
leaping
into
the
air
and
emitting
that
chilled
them
to
the
marrow
toad
he
went
he
yelled
i
ll
pleasure
em
and
he
went
straight
for
the
chief
weasel
they
were
but
four
in
all
but
to
the
weasels
the
hall
seemed
full
of
monstrous
animals
grey
black
brown
and
yellow
whooping
and
flourishing
enormous
cudgels
and
they
broke
and
fled
with
squeals
of
terror
and
dismay
this
way
and
that
through
the
windows
up
the
chimney
anywhere
to
get
out
of
reach
of
those
terrible
sticks
the
affair
was
soon
over
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
the
hall
strode
the
four
friends
whacking
with
their
sticks
at
every
head
that
showed
itself
and
in
five
minutes
the
room
was
cleared
through
the
broken
windows
the
shrieks
of
terrified
weasels
escaping
across
the
lawn
were
borne
faintly
to
their
ears
on
the
floor
lay
prostrate
some
dozen
or
so
of
the
enemy
on
whom
the
mole
was
busily
engaged
in
fitting
handcuffs
the
badger
resting
from
his
labours
leant
on
his
stick
and
wiped
his
honest
brow
mole
he
said
you
re
the
best
of
fellows
just
cut
along
outside
and
look
after
those
of
yours
and
see
what
they
re
doing
i
ve
an
idea
that
thanks
to
you
we
shan
t
have
much
trouble
from
them
the
mole
vanished
promptly
through
a
window
and
the
badger
bade
the
other
two
set
a
table
on
its
legs
again
pick
up
knives
and
forks
and
plates
and
glasses
from
the
debris
on
the
floor
and
see
if
they
could
find
materials
for
a
supper
i
want
some
grub
i
do
he
said
in
that
rather
common
way
he
had
of
speaking
stir
your
stumps
toad
and
look
lively
we
ve
got
your
house
back
for
you
and
you
don
t
offer
us
so
much
as
a
toad
felt
rather
hurt
that
the
badger
didn
t
say
pleasant
things
to
him
as
he
had
to
the
mole
and
tell
him
what
a
fine
fellow
he
was
and
how
splendidly
he
had
fought
for
he
was
rather
particularly
pleased
with
himself
and
the
way
he
had
gone
for
the
chief
weasel
and
sent
him
flying
across
the
table
with
one
blow
of
his
stick
but
he
bustled
about
and
so
did
the
rat
and
soon
they
found
some
guava
jelly
in
a
glass
dish
and
a
cold
chicken
a
tongue
that
had
hardly
been
touched
some
trifle
and
quite
a
lot
of
lobster
salad
and
in
the
pantry
they
came
upon
a
basketful
of
french
rolls
and
any
quantity
of
cheese
butter
and
celery
they
were
just
about
to
sit
down
when
the
mole
clambered
in
through
the
window
chuckling
with
an
armful
of
rifles
it
s
all
over
he
reported
from
what
i
can
make
out
as
soon
as
the
stoats
who
were
very
nervous
and
jumpy
already
heard
the
shrieks
and
the
yells
and
the
uproar
inside
the
hall
some
of
them
threw
down
their
rifles
and
fled
the
others
stood
fast
for
a
bit
but
when
the
weasels
came
rushing
out
upon
them
they
thought
they
were
betrayed
and
the
stoats
grappled
with
the
weasels
and
the
weasels
fought
to
get
away
and
they
wrestled
and
wriggled
and
punched
each
other
and
rolled
over
and
over
till
most
of
em
rolled
into
the
river
they
ve
all
disappeared
by
now
one
way
or
another
and
i
ve
got
their
rifles
so
that
s
all
right
excellent
and
deserving
animal
said
the
badger
his
mouth
full
of
chicken
and
trifle
now
there
s
just
one
more
thing
i
want
you
to
do
mole
before
you
sit
down
to
your
supper
along
of
us
and
i
wouldn
t
trouble
you
only
i
know
i
can
trust
you
to
see
a
thing
done
and
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
of
every
one
i
know
i
d
send
rat
if
he
wasn
t
a
poet
i
want
you
to
take
those
fellows
on
the
floor
there
upstairs
with
you
and
have
some
bedrooms
cleaned
out
and
tidied
up
and
made
really
comfortable
see
that
they
sweep
under
the
beds
and
put
clean
sheets
and
on
and
turn
down
one
corner
of
the
just
as
you
know
it
ought
to
be
done
and
have
a
can
of
hot
water
and
clean
towels
and
fresh
cakes
of
soap
put
in
each
room
and
then
you
can
give
them
a
licking
if
it
s
any
satisfaction
to
you
and
put
them
out
by
the
and
we
shan
t
see
any
more
of
them
i
fancy
and
then
come
along
and
have
some
of
this
cold
tongue
it
s
first
rate
i
m
very
pleased
with
you
mole
the
goodnatured
mole
picked
up
a
stick
formed
his
prisoners
up
in
a
line
on
the
floor
gave
them
the
order
quick
march
and
led
his
squad
off
to
the
upper
floor
after
a
time
he
appeared
again
smiling
and
said
that
every
room
was
ready
and
as
clean
as
a
new
pin
and
i
didn
t
have
to
lick
them
either
he
added
i
thought
on
the
whole
they
had
had
licking
enough
for
one
night
and
the
weasels
when
i
put
the
point
to
them
quite
agreed
with
me
and
said
they
wouldn
t
think
of
troubling
me
they
were
very
penitent
and
said
they
were
extremely
sorry
for
what
they
had
done
but
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
chief
weasel
and
the
stoats
and
if
ever
they
could
do
anything
for
us
at
any
time
to
make
up
we
had
only
got
to
mention
it
so
i
gave
them
a
roll
and
let
them
out
at
the
back
and
off
they
ran
as
hard
as
they
could
then
the
mole
pulled
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
pitched
into
the
cold
tongue
and
toad
like
the
gentleman
he
was
put
all
his
jealousy
from
him
and
said
heartily
thank
you
kindly
dear
mole
for
all
your
pains
and
trouble
tonight
and
especially
for
your
cleverness
this
morning
the
badger
was
pleased
at
that
and
said
there
spoke
my
brave
toad
so
they
finished
their
supper
in
great
joy
and
contentment
and
presently
retired
to
rest
between
clean
sheets
safe
in
toad
s
ancestral
home
won
back
by
matchless
valour
consummate
strategy
and
a
proper
handling
of
sticks
the
following
morning
toad
who
had
overslept
himself
as
usual
came
down
to
breakfast
disgracefully
late
and
found
on
the
table
a
certain
quantity
of
some
fragments
of
cold
and
leathery
toast
a
empty
and
really
very
little
else
which
did
not
tend
to
improve
his
temper
considering
that
after
all
it
was
his
own
house
through
the
french
windows
of
the
he
could
see
the
mole
and
the
water
rat
sitting
in
out
on
the
lawn
evidently
telling
each
other
stories
roaring
with
laughter
and
kicking
their
short
legs
up
in
the
air
the
badger
who
was
in
an
and
deep
in
the
morning
paper
merely
looked
up
and
nodded
when
toad
entered
the
room
but
toad
knew
his
man
so
he
sat
down
and
made
the
best
breakfast
he
could
merely
observing
to
himself
that
he
would
get
square
with
the
others
sooner
or
later
when
he
had
nearly
finished
the
badger
looked
up
and
remarked
rather
shortly
i
m
sorry
toad
but
i
m
afraid
there
s
a
heavy
morning
s
work
in
front
of
you
you
see
we
really
ought
to
have
a
banquet
at
once
to
celebrate
this
affair
it
s
expected
of
you
in
fact
it
s
the
o
all
right
said
the
toad
readily
anything
to
oblige
though
why
on
earth
you
should
want
to
have
a
banquet
in
the
morning
i
can
not
understand
but
you
know
i
do
not
live
to
please
myself
but
merely
to
find
out
what
my
friends
want
and
then
try
and
arrange
it
for
em
you
dear
old
badger
don
t
pretend
to
be
stupider
than
you
really
are
replied
the
badger
crossly
and
don
t
chuckle
and
splutter
in
your
coffee
while
you
re
talking
it
s
not
manners
what
i
mean
is
the
banquet
will
be
at
night
of
course
but
the
invitations
will
have

others

wish
it

and
it
shall
be
done
go
badger
order
the
banquet
order
what
you

join
our
young
friends
outside
in
their
innocent
mirth
oblivious
of
me
and
my
cares
and
toils
i
sacrifice
this
fair
morning
on
the
altar
of
duty
and
friendship
the
badger
looked
at
him
very
suspiciously
but
toad
s
frank
open
countenance
made
it
difficult
to
suggest
any
unworthy
motive
in
this
change
of
attitude
he
quitted
the
room
accordingly
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
and
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
toad
hurried
to
the
a
fine
idea
had
occurred
to
him
while
he
was
talking
he
would
write
the
invitations
and
he
would
take
care
to
mention
the
leading
part
he
had
taken
in
the
fight
and
how
he
had
laid
the
chief
weasel
flat
and
he
would
hint
at
his
adventures
and
what
a
career
of
triumph
he
had
to
tell
about
and
on
the
he
would
set
out
a
sort
of
a
programme
of
entertainment
for
the
evening
something
like
this
as
he
sketched
it
out
in
his
head
speech
by
toad
there
will
be
other
speeches
by
toad
during
the
evening
address
by
toad
synopsis
our
prison
system
the
waterways
of
old
england
and
how
to
deal
property
its
rights
and
its
duties
back
to
the
land
a
typical
english
squire
song
by
toad
composed
by
himself
other
compositions
by
toad
will
be
sung
in
the
course
of
the
evening
by
the
composer
the
idea
pleased
him
mightily
and
he
worked
very
hard
and
got
all
the
letters
finished
by
noon
at
which
hour
it
was
reported
to
him
that
there
was
a
small
and
rather
bedraggled
weasel
at
the
door
inquiring
timidly
whether
he
could
be
of
any
service
to
the
gentlemen
toad
swaggered
out
and
found
it
was
one
of
the
prisoners
of
the
previous
evening
very
respectful
and
anxious
to
please
he
patted
him
on
the
head
shoved
the
bundle
of
invitations
into
his
paw
and
told
him
to
cut
along
quick
and
deliver
them
as
fast
as
he
could
and
if
he
liked
to
come
back
again
in
the
evening
perhaps
there
might
be
a
shilling
for
him
or
again
perhaps
there
mightn
t
and
the
poor
weasel
seemed
really
quite
grateful
and
hurried
off
eagerly
to
do
his
mission
when
the
other
animals
came
back
to
luncheon
very
boisterous
and
breezy
after
a
morning
on
the
river
the
mole
whose
conscience
had
been
pricking
him
looked
doubtfully
at
toad
expecting
to
find
him
sulky
or
depressed
instead
he
was
so
uppish
and
inflated
that
the
mole
began
to
suspect
something
while
the
rat
and
the
badger
exchanged
significant
glances
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
toad
thrust
his
paws
deep
into
his
remarked
casually
well
look
after
yourselves
you
fellows
ask
for
anything
you
want
and
was
swaggering
off
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
where
he
wanted
to
think
out
an
idea
or
two
for
his
coming
speeches
when
the
rat
caught
him
by
the
arm
toad
rather
suspected
what
he
was
after
and
did
his
best
to
get
away
but
when
the
badger
took
him
firmly
by
the
other
arm
he
began
to
see
that
the
game
was
up
the
two
animals
conducted
him
between
them
into
the
small
that
opened
out
of
the
shut
the
door
and
put
him
into
a
chair
then
they
both
stood
in
front
of
him
while
toad
sat
silent
and
regarded
them
with
much
suspicion
and
now
look
here
toad
said
the
rat
it
s
about
this
banquet
and
very
sorry
i
am
to
have
to
speak
to
you
like
this
but
we
want
you
to
understand
clearly
once
and
for
all
that
there
are
going
to
be
no
speeches
and
no
songs
try
and
grasp
the
fact
that
on
this
occasion
we
re
not
arguing
with
you
we
re
just
telling
toad
saw
that
he
was
trapped
they
understood
him
they
saw
through
him
they
had
got
ahead
of
him
his
pleasant
dream
was
shattered
mayn
t
i
sing
them
just
one
little
song
he
pleaded
piteously
no
not
one
little
song
replied
the
rat
firmly
though
his
heart
bled
as
he
noticed
the
trembling
lip
of
the
poor
disappointed
toad
it
s
no
good
toady
you
know
well
that
your
songs
are
all
conceit
and
boasting
and
vanity
and
your
speeches
are
all
and
and
well
and
gross
exaggeration
and
and
and
gas
put
in
the
badger
in
his
common
way
it
s
for
your
own
good
toady
went
on
the
rat
you
know
you
must
turn
over
a
new
leaf
sooner
or
later
and
now
seems
a
splendid
time
to
begin
a
sort
of
in
your
career
please
don
t
think
that
saying
all
this
doesn
t
hurt
me
more
than
it
hurts
toad
remained
a
long
while
plunged
in
thought
at
last
he
raised
his
head
and
the
traces
of
strong
emotion
were
visible
on
his
features
you
have
conquered
my
friends
he
said
in
broken
accents
it
was
to
be
sure
but
a
small
thing
that
i
asked
merely
leave
to
blossom
and
expand
for
yet
one
more
evening
to
let
myself
go
and
hear
the
tumultuous
applause
that
always
seems
to
me
somehow
to
bring
out
my
best
qualities
however
you
are
right
i
know
and
i
am
wrong
hence
forth
i
will
be
a
very
different
toad
my
friends
you
shall
never
have
occasion
to
blush
for
me
again
but
o
dear
o
dear
this
is
a
hard
world
and
pressing
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
he
left
the
room
with
faltering
footsteps
badger
said
the
rat
feel
like
a
brute
i
wonder
what
you
feel
like
o
i
know
i
know
said
the
badger
gloomily
but
the
thing
had
to
be
done
this
good
fellow
has
got
to
live
here
and
hold
his
own
and
be
respected
would
you
have
him
a
common
mocked
and
jeered
at
by
stoats
and
weasels
of
course
not
said
the
rat
and
talking
of
weasels
it
s
lucky
we
came
upon
that
little
weasel
just
as
he
was
setting
out
with
toad
s
invitations
i
suspected
something
from
what
you
told
me
and
had
a
look
at
one
or
two
they
were
simply
disgraceful
i
confiscated
the
lot
and
the
good
mole
is
now
sitting
in
the
blue
boudoir
filling
up
plain
simple
invitation
at
last
the
hour
for
the
banquet
began
to
draw
near
and
toad
who
on
leaving
the
others
had
retired
to
his
bedroom
was
still
sitting
there
melancholy
and
thoughtful
his
brow
resting
on
his
paw
he
pondered
long
and
deeply
gradually
his
countenance
cleared
and
he
began
to
smile
long
slow
smiles
then
he
took
to
giggling
in
a
shy
manner
at
last
he
got
up
locked
the
door
drew
the
curtains
across
the
windows
collected
all
the
chairs
in
the
room
and
arranged
them
in
a
semicircle
and
took
up
his
position
in
front
of
them
swelling
visibly
then
he
bowed
coughed
twice
and
letting
himself
go
with
uplifted
voice
he
sang
to
the
enraptured
audience
that
his
imagination
so
clearly
saw
toad
s
last
little
song
the
toad
came
home
there
was
panic
in
the
parlours
and
howling
in
the
halls
there
was
crying
in
the
and
shrieking
in
the
stalls
when
the
toad
came
home
when
the
toad
came
home
there
was
smashing
in
of
window
and
crashing
in
of
door
there
was
chivvying
of
weasels
that
fainted
on
the
floor
when
the
toad
came
home
bang
go
the
drums
the
trumpeters
are
tooting
and
the
soldiers
are
saluting
and
the
cannon
they
are
shooting
and
the
are
hooting
as
the
hero
comes
shout
and
let
each
one
of
the
crowd
try
and
shout
it
very
loud
in
honour
of
an
animal
of
whom
you
re
justly
proud
for
it
s
toad
s
great
day
he
sang
this
very
loud
with
great
unction
and
expression
and
when
he
had
done
he
sang
it
all
over
again
then
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
a
long
long
long
sigh
then
he
dipped
his
hairbrush
in
the
parted
his
hair
in
the
middle
and
plastered
it
down
very
straight
and
sleek
on
each
side
of
his
face
and
unlocking
the
door
went
quietly
down
the
stairs
to
greet
his
guests
who
he
knew
must
be
assembling
in
the
all
the
animals
cheered
when
he
entered
and
crowded
round
to
congratulate
him
and
say
nice
things
about
his
courage
and
his
cleverness
and
his
fighting
qualities
but
toad
only
smiled
faintly
and
murmured
not
at
all
or
sometimes
for
a
change
on
the
contrary
otter
who
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
describing
to
an
admiring
circle
of
friends
exactly
how
he
would
have
managed
things
had
he
been
there
came
forward
with
a
shout
threw
his
arm
round
toad
s
neck
and
tried
to
take
him
round
the
room
in
triumphal
progress
but
toad
in
a
mild
way
was
rather
snubby
to
him
remarking
gently
as
he
disengaged
himself
badger
s
was
the
mastermind
the
mole
and
the
water
rat
bore
the
brunt
of
the
fighting
i
merely
served
in
the
ranks
and
did
little
or
the
animals
were
evidently
puzzled
and
taken
aback
by
this
unexpected
attitude
of
his
and
toad
felt
as
he
moved
from
one
guest
to
the
other
making
his
modest
responses
that
he
was
an
object
of
absorbing
interest
to
every
one
the
badger
had
ordered
everything
of
the
best
and
the
banquet
was
a
great
success
there
was
much
talking
and
laughter
and
chaff
among
the
animals
but
through
it
all
toad
who
of
course
was
in
the
chair
looked
down
his
nose
and
murmured
pleasant
nothings
to
the
animals
on
either
side
of
him
at
intervals
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
badger
and
the
rat
and
always
when
he
looked
they
were
staring
at
each
other
with
their
mouths
open
and
this
gave
him
the
greatest
satisfaction
some
of
the
younger
and
livelier
animals
as
the
evening
wore
on
got
whispering
to
each
other
that
things
were
not
so
amusing
as
they
used
to
be
in
the
good
old
days
and
there
were
some
knockings
on
the
table
and
cries
of
toad
speech
speech
from
toad
song
toad
s
song
but
toad
only
shook
his
head
gently
raised
one
paw
in
mild
protest
and
by
pressing
delicacies
on
his
guests
by
topical
and
by
earnest
inquiries
after
members
of
their
families
not
yet
old
enough
to
appear
at
social
functions
managed
to
convey
to
them
that
this
dinner
was
being
run
on
strictly
conventional
lines
he
was
indeed
an
altered
toad
after
this
climax
the
four
animals
continued
to
lead
their
lives
so
rudely
broken
in
upon
by
civil
war
in
great
joy
and
contentment
undisturbed
by
further
risings
or
invasions
toad
after
due
consultation
with
his
friends
selected
a
handsome
gold
chain
and
locket
set
with
pearls
which
he
dispatched
to
the
gaoler
s
daughter
with
a
letter
that
even
the
badger
admitted
to
be
modest
grateful
and
appreciative
and
the
in
his
turn
was
properly
thanked
and
compensated
for
all
his
pains
and
trouble
under
severe
compulsion
from
the
badger
even
the
was
with
some
trouble
sought
out
and
the
value
of
her
horse
discreetly
made
good
to
her
though
toad
kicked
terribly
at
this
holding
himself
to
be
an
instrument
of
fate
sent
to
punish
fat
women
with
mottled
arms
who
couldn
t
tell
a
real
gentleman
when
they
saw
one
the
amount
involved
it
was
true
was
not
very
burdensome
the
gipsy
s
valuation
being
admitted
by
local
assessors
to
be
approximately
correct
sometimes
in
the
course
of
long
summer
evenings
the
friends
would
take
a
stroll
together
in
the
wild
wood
now
successfully
tamed
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
and
it
was
pleasing
to
see
how
respectfully
they
were
greeted
by
the
inhabitants
and
how
the
would
bring
their
young
ones
to
the
mouths
of
their
holes
and
say
pointing
look
baby
there
goes
the
great
toad
and
that
s
the
gallant
water
rat
a
terrible
fighter
walking
along
o
him
and
yonder
comes
the
famous
mole
of
whom
you
so
often
have
heard
your
father
tell
but
when
their
infants
were
fractious
and
quite
beyond
control
they
would
quiet
them
by
telling
how
if
they
didn
t
hush
them
and
not
fret
them
the
terrible
grey
badger
would
up
and
get
them
this
was
a
base
libel
on
badger
who
though
he
cared
little
about
society
was
rather
fond
of
children
but
it
never
failed
to
have
its
full
effect
