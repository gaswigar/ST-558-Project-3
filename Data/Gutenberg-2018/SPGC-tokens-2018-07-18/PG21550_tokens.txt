the
king
own
by
captain
marryat
captain
frederick
marryat
was
born
july
and
died
august
he
retired
from
the
british
navy
in
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
writing
in
the
following
years
he
wrote
books
many
of
which
are
among
the
very
best
of
english
literature
and
some
of
which
are
still
in
print
marryat
had
an
extraordinary
gift
for
the
invention
of
episodes
in
his
stories
he
says
somewhere
that
when
he
sat
down
for
the
day
work
he
never
knew
what
he
was
going
to
write
he
certainly
was
a
literary
genius
the
king
own
was
published
in
the
second
book
to
flow
from
marryat
pen
it
is
almost
as
though
marryat
was
born
as
a
talented
and
polished
writer
the
fact
is
though
that
for
these
early
books
he
was
still
at
sea
when
most
of
the
work
was
done
and
with
lots
of
time
since
he
was
engaged
in
looking
for
a
but
reported
island
in
this
was
transcribed
in
by
nick
hodson
and
was
reformatted
in
and
again
in
the
king
own
by
captain
frederick
marryat
chapter
one
however
boldly
their
warm
blood
was
spilt
their
life
was
shame
their
epitaph
was
guilt
and
this
they
knew
and
felt
at
least
the
one
the
leader
of
the
hand
he
had
undone
who
born
for
better
things
had
madly
set
his
life
upon
a
cast
which
linger
yet
byron
there
is
perhaps
no
event
in
the
annals
of
our
history
which
excited
more
alarm
at
the
time
of
its
occurrence
or
has
since
been
the
subject
of
more
general
interest
than
the
mutiny
at
the
nore
in
the
year
forty
thousand
men
to
whom
the
nation
looked
for
defence
from
its
surrounding
enemies
and
in
steadfast
reliance
upon
whose
bravery
it
lay
down
every
night
in
tranquillity
men
who
had
dared
everything
for
their
king
and
country
and
in
whose
breasts
patriotism
although
suppressed
for
the
time
could
never
be
extinguished
irritated
by
ungrateful
neglect
on
the
one
hand
and
by
seditious
advisers
on
the
other
turned
the
guns
which
they
had
so
often
manned
in
defence
of
the
english
flag
against
their
own
countrymen
and
their
own
home
and
with
all
the
acrimony
of
feeling
ever
attending
family
quarrels
seemed
determined
to
sacrifice
the
nation
and
themselves
rather
than
listen
to
the
dictates
of
reason
and
of
conscience
doubtless
there
is
a
point
at
which
endurance
of
oppression
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
and
rebellion
can
no
longer
be
considered
as
a
crime
but
it
is
a
dangerous
and
intricate
problem
the
solution
of
which
had
better
not
be
attempted
it
must
however
be
acknowledged
that
the
seamen
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
mutiny
had
just
grounds
of
complaint
and
that
they
did
not
proceed
to
acts
of
violence
until
repeated
and
humble
remonstrance
had
been
made
in
vain
whether
we
act
in
a
body
or
individually
such
is
the
infirmity
and
selfishness
of
human
nature
that
we
often
surrender
to
importunity
that
which
we
refuse
to
the
dictates
of
gratitude
yielding
for
our
own
comfort
to
the
demands
of
turbulence
while
quiet
unpretending
merit
is
overlooked
and
oppressed
until
roused
by
neglect
it
demands
as
a
right
what
policy
alone
should
have
granted
as
a
favour
such
was
the
behaviour
on
the
part
of
government
which
produced
the
mutiny
at
the
nore
what
mechanism
is
more
complex
than
the
mind
of
man
and
as
in
all
machinery
there
are
wheels
and
springs
of
action
not
apparent
without
close
examination
of
the
interior
so
pride
ambition
avarice
love
play
alternately
or
conjointly
upon
the
human
mind
which
under
their
influence
is
whirled
round
like
the
weathercock
in
the
hurricane
only
pointing
for
a
short
time
in
one
direction
but
for
that
time
steadfastly
how
difficult
then
to
analyse
the
motives
and
inducements
which
actuated
the
several
ringleaders
in
this
dreadful
crisis
let
us
therefore
confine
ourselves
to
what
we
do
really
know
to
have
been
the
origin
of
discontent
in
one
of
these
men
whose
unfortunate
career
is
intimately
connected
with
this
history
edward
peters
was
a
man
of
talent
and
education
he
had
entered
on
board
the
in
a
fit
of
desperation
to
obtain
the
bounty
for
a
present
support
and
his
pay
as
a
future
provision
for
his
wife
and
an
only
child
the
fruit
of
a
hasty
and
unfortunate
marriage
he
was
soon
distinguished
as
a
person
of
superior
attainments
and
instead
of
being
employed
as
a
landsman
usually
is
in
the
afterguard
or
waist
of
the
ship
he
was
placed
under
the
orders
of
the
purser
and
captain
clerk
as
an
amanuensis
in
this
capacity
he
remained
two
or
three
years
approved
of
and
treated
with
unusual
respect
by
the
officers
for
his
gentlemanlike
appearance
and
behaviour
but
unfortunately
a
theft
had
been
committed
a
watch
of
trifling
value
had
been
purloined
from
the
purser
cabin
and
as
he
was
the
only
person
with
the
exception
of
the
servant
who
had
free
ingress
and
egress
suspicion
fell
upon
him
the
more
so
as
after
every
search
that
could
be
made
had
proved
ineffectual
it
was
supposed
that
the
purloined
property
had
been
sent
on
shore
to
be
disposed
of
by
his
wife
who
with
his
child
had
frequently
been
permitted
to
visit
him
on
board
summoned
on
the
and
harshly
interrogated
called
a
scoundrel
by
the
captain
before
conviction
the
proud
blood
mantled
in
the
cheeks
of
one
who
at
that
period
was
incapable
of
crime
the
blush
of
virtuous
indignation
was
construed
into
presumptive
evidence
of
guilt
the
captain
a
superficial
presuming
pompous
yet
cowardly
creature
whose
conduct
assisted
in
no
small
degree
to
excite
the
mutiny
on
board
of
his
own
ship
declared
himself
quite
convinced
of
peters
guilt
because
he
blushed
at
the
bare
idea
of
being
suspected
and
punishment
ensued
with
all
the
degradation
allotted
to
an
offence
which
is
never
forgiven
on
board
of
a
there
is
perhaps
no
crime
that
is
attended
with
such
serious
consequences
on
board
a
ship
as
theft
a
succession
of
thefts
undiscovered
will
disintegrate
a
ship
company
break
up
the
messes
destroy
all
confidence
and
harmony
and
occasion
those
who
have
been
the
dearest
friends
to
become
the
greatest
enemies
for
whom
can
a
person
suspect
when
he
has
lost
his
property
in
so
confined
a
space
but
those
who
were
acquainted
with
its
being
in
his
possession
and
with
the
place
in
which
it
was
deposited
and
who
are
these
but
his
own
messmates
or
those
in
whom
he
most
confided
after
positive
conviction
no
punishment
can
be
too
severe
for
a
crime
that
produces
such
mischief
but
to
degrade
a
man
by
corporal
punishment
to
ruin
his
character
and
render
him
an
object
of
abhorrence
and
contempt
in
the
absence
of
even
bare
presumptive
evidence
was
an
act
of
cruelty
and
injustice
which
could
excite
but
one
feeling
and
from
that
day
the
man
who
would
have
gloried
in
dying
for
his
country
became
a
discontented
gloomy
and
dangerous
subject
the
above
effect
would
have
been
produced
in
any
man
but
to
peters
whose
previous
history
we
have
yet
to
narrate
death
itself
would
have
been
preferable
his
heart
did
not
break
but
it
swelled
with
contending
passions
till
it
was
burst
and
riven
with
wounds
never
to
be
cicatrised
suffering
under
the
most
painful
burthen
that
can
oppress
a
man
who
values
reputation
writhing
with
the
injustice
of
accusation
when
innocent
of
conviction
without
proof
and
of
punishment
unmerited
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
peters
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
deserting
from
the
ship
there
is
a
particular
feeling
pervading
animal
nature
from
which
man
himself
is
not
exempt
indeed
with
all
his
boasted
reason
man
still
inherits
too
many
of
the
propensities
of
the
brute
creation
i
refer
to
that
disposition
which
not
only
inclines
us
to
feel
satisfaction
at
finding
we
have
companions
in
misfortune
but
too
often
stimulates
us
to
increase
the
number
by
our
own
exertions
from
the
stupendous
elephant
down
to
the
smallest
of
the
feathered
tribe
all
will
act
as
a
decoy
to
their
own
species
when
in
captivity
themselves
and
in
all
compulsory
service
which
may
be
considered
a
species
of
captivity
man
proves
that
he
is
imbued
with
the
same
propensity
seamen
that
have
been
pressed
themselves
into
the
navy
are
invariably
the
most
active
in
pressing
others
and
both
soldiers
and
sailors
have
a
secret
pleasure
in
recapturing
a
deserter
even
at
the
very
time
when
they
are
watching
an
opportunity
to
desert
themselves
the
bonds
of
friendship
seem
destroyed
when
this
powerful
and
brutal
feeling
is
called
into
action
and
as
has
frequently
occurred
in
the
service
before
and
since
the
man
who
was
selected
by
peters
as
his
most
intimate
friend
the
man
with
whom
he
had
consulted
and
to
whom
he
had
confided
his
plans
for
desertion
gave
information
of
the
retreat
of
his
wife
and
child
from
which
place
peters
was
not
likely
to
be
very
distant
and
thus
with
the
assistance
of
this
his
dearest
friend
the
and
party
in
quest
of
him
succeeded
in
his
capture
it
so
happened
that
on
the
very
day
on
which
peters
was
brought
on
board
and
put
into
irons
the
purser
servant
was
discovered
to
have
in
his
possession
the
watch
that
had
been
lost
thus
far
the
character
of
peters
was
reinstated
and
as
he
had
declared
at
the
time
of
his
capture
that
the
unjust
punishment
which
he
had
received
had
been
the
motive
of
his
desertion
the
captain
was
strongly
urged
by
the
officers
to
overlook
an
offence
which
had
everything
to
be
offered
in
its
extenuation
but
captain
a
was
fond
of
he
imagined
that
they
added
to
his
consequence
which
certainly
required
to
be
upheld
by
adventitious
aid
moreover
the
feeling
too
often
pervading
little
minds
that
of
a
dislike
taken
to
a
person
because
you
have
injured
him
and
the
preferring
to
accumulate
injustice
rather
than
to
acknowledge
error
had
more
than
due
weight
with
this
weak
man
a
was
held
and
peters
was
sentenced
to
death
but
in
consideration
of
circumstances
the
sentence
was
mitigated
to
that
of
being
flogged
round
the
fleet
mitigated
strange
vanity
in
men
that
they
should
imagine
their
own
feelings
to
be
more
sensible
and
acute
than
those
of
others
that
they
should
consider
that
a
mitigation
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
which
had
they
been
placed
in
his
situation
they
would
have
declared
an
of
the
punishment
not
a
captain
who
sat
upon
that
but
would
have
considered
as
peters
did
that
death
was
by
far
the
more
lenient
sentence
of
the
two
yet
they
meant
well
they
felt
kindly
towards
him
and
acknowledged
his
provocations
but
they
fell
into
the
too
common
error
of
supposing
that
the
finer
feelings
which
induce
a
man
to
prefer
death
to
dishonour
are
only
to
be
recognised
among
the
higher
classes
and
that
because
circumstances
may
have
placed
a
man
before
the
mast
he
will
undergo
punishment
however
severe
however
degrading
in
short
every
ill
that
flesh
is
heir
to
in
preference
to
death
as
the
reader
may
not
perhaps
be
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
punishment
to
which
peters
was
sentenced
and
the
ceremonies
by
which
it
is
attended
i
shall
enter
into
a
short
description
of
it
a
man
sentenced
to
be
flogged
round
the
fleet
receives
an
equal
part
of
the
whole
number
of
lashes
awarded
alongside
each
ship
composing
that
fleet
for
instance
if
sentenced
to
three
hundred
lashes
in
a
fleet
composed
of
ten
sail
he
will
receive
thirty
alongside
of
each
ship
a
launch
is
fitted
up
with
a
platform
and
shears
it
is
occupied
by
the
unfortunate
individual
the
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
with
their
implements
of
office
and
armed
marines
stationed
at
the
bow
and
stern
when
the
signal
is
made
for
punishment
all
the
ships
in
the
fleet
send
one
or
two
boats
each
with
crews
cleanly
dressed
the
officers
in
full
uniform
and
marines
under
arms
these
boats
collect
at
the
side
of
the
ship
where
the
launch
is
lying
the
hands
are
turned
up
and
the
ship
company
are
ordered
to
mount
the
rigging
to
witness
that
portion
of
the
whole
punishment
which
after
the
sentence
has
been
read
is
inflicted
upon
the
prisoner
when
he
has
received
the
allotted
number
of
lashes
he
is
for
the
time
released
and
permitted
to
sit
down
with
a
blanket
over
his
shoulders
while
the
boats
which
attend
the
execution
of
the
sentence
make
fast
to
the
launch
and
tow
it
to
the
next
ship
in
the
fleet
where
the
same
number
of
lashes
are
inflicted
with
corresponding
ceremonies
and
thus
he
is
towed
from
one
ship
to
another
until
he
has
received
the
whole
of
his
punishment
the
severity
of
this
punishment
consists
not
only
in
the
number
of
lashes
but
in
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
they
are
inflicted
as
after
the
unfortunate
wretch
has
received
the
first
part
of
his
sentence
alongside
of
one
ship
the
blood
is
allowed
to
congeal
and
the
wounds
partially
to
close
during
the
interval
which
takes
place
previously
to
his
arrival
alongside
of
the
next
when
the
cat
again
subjects
him
to
renewed
and
increased
torture
during
the
latter
part
of
the
punishment
the
suffering
is
dreadful
and
a
man
who
has
undergone
this
sentence
is
generally
broken
down
in
constitution
if
not
in
spirits
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
such
was
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
the
unfortunate
peters
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
decide
at
the
moment
when
it
was
completed
and
the
blanket
thrown
over
his
shoulders
whether
the
heart
or
the
back
of
the
fainting
man
were
the
more
lacerated
of
the
two
time
can
heal
the
wounds
of
the
body
over
which
it
holds
its
empire
but
those
of
the
soul
like
the
soul
itself
spurn
his
transitory
sway
peters
from
that
moment
was
a
desperate
man
a
short
time
after
he
had
undergone
his
sentence
the
news
of
the
mutiny
at
spithead
was
communicated
and
the
vacillation
and
apprehensions
of
the
admiralty
and
of
the
nation
at
large
were
not
to
be
concealed
this
mutiny
was
apparently
quelled
by
conciliation
but
conciliation
is
but
a
half
measure
and
ineffectual
when
offered
from
superiors
to
inferiors
in
this
world
i
know
not
why
there
seems
to
be
but
one
seal
binding
in
all
contracts
of
magnitude
and
that
seal
is
blood
without
referring
to
the
jewish
types
proclaiming
that
all
things
were
purified
by
blood
and
without
shedding
of
blood
there
was
no
remission
without
referring
to
that
sublime
mystery
by
which
these
types
have
been
fulfilled
it
appears
as
if
in
all
ages
and
all
countries
blood
had
been
the
only
seal
of
security
examine
the
records
of
history
the
revolution
of
opinion
the
public
tumults
the
warfare
for
religious
ascendency
it
will
be
found
that
without
this
seal
these
were
only
lulled
for
the
moment
and
invariably
recommenced
until
had
made
its
appearance
as
witness
to
the
act
and
deed
chapter
two
this
is
a
long
description
but
applies
to
scarce
five
minutes
past
before
the
eyes
but
yet
what
minutes
moments
like
to
these
rend
men
lives
into
immortalities
byron
the
mutiny
at
spithead
was
soon
followed
up
by
that
at
the
nore
and
the
ringleader
parker
like
a
meteor
darting
through
the
firmament
sprung
from
nothing
corruscated
dazzled
and
disappeared
the
texel
fleet
joined
except
a
few
ships
which
the
courage
and
conduct
of
the
gallant
old
admiral
duncan
preserved
from
the
contagion
let
me
here
digress
a
little
to
introduce
to
my
readers
the
speech
made
by
this
officer
to
his
ship
company
on
the
first
symptoms
of
disaffection
it
is
supposed
that
sailors
are
not
eloquent
i
assert
that
with
the
exception
of
the
north
american
indians
who
have
to
perfection
the
art
of
saying
much
in
few
words
there
are
few
people
more
eloquent
than
sailors
the
general
object
looked
for
in
this
world
is
to
obtain
the
greatest

with

if
so
the
more
simple
the

the

is
condensed
the
nearer
we
approach
to
perfection
flourishes
and

of

may
be
compared
to
extra

applied
to
a
carriage
increasing
the
rattling
and
complexity
of
the
machine
without
adding
to
either
the
strength
of
its
fabric
or
the
rapidity
of
its
course
it
was
on
the
of
june
that
the
fleet
at
the
nore
was
joined
by
the
leopard
and
other
ships
which
had
separated
from
admiral
duncan
fleet
when
the
admiral
found
himself
deserted
by
part
of
his
own
fleet
he
called
his
own
ship
crew
together
and
addressed
them
in
the
following
speech
my
lads
i
once
more
call
you
together
with
a
sorrowful
heart
owing
to
what
i
have
lately
seen
the
disaffection
of
the
fleets
i
call
it
disaffection
for
the
crews
have
no
grievances
to
be
deserted
by
my
fleet
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
is
a
disgrace
which
i
believe
never
before
happened
to
a
british
admiral
nor
could
i
have
supposed
it
possible
my
greatest
comfort
under
god
is
that
i
have
been
supported
by
the
officers
seamen
and
marines
of
this
ship
for
which
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
gratitude
i
request
you
to
accept
my
sincere
thanks
i
flatter
myself
much
good
may
result
from
your
example
by
bringing
those
deluded
people
to
a
sense
of
the
duty
which
they
owe
not
only
to
their
king
and
country
but
to
themselves
the
british
navy
has
ever
been
the
support
of
that
liberty
which
has
been
handed
down
to
us
by
our
ancestors
and
which
i
trust
we
shall
maintain
to
the
latest
posterity
and
that
can
only
be
done
by
unanimity
and
obedience
this
ship
company
and
others
who
have
distinguished
themselves
by
loyalty
and
good
order
deserve
to
be
and
doubtless
will
be
the
favourites
of
a
grateful
nation
they
will
also
have
from
their
inward
feelings
a
comfort
which
will
be
lasting
and
not
like
the
floating
and
false
confidence
of
those
who
have
swerved
from
their
duty
it
has
often
been
my
pride
with
you
to
look
into
the
texel
and
see
a
foe
which
dreaded
coming
out
to
meet
us
my
pride
is
now
humbled
indeed
our
cup
has
overflowed
and
made
us
wanton
the
providence
has
given
us
this
check
as
a
warning
and
i
hope
we
shall
improve
by
it
on
him
then
let
us
trust
where
our
only
security
is
to
be
found
i
find
there
are
many
good
men
among
us
for
my
own
part
i
have
had
full
confidence
of
all
in
this
ship
and
once
more
i
beg
to
express
my
approbation
of
your
conduct
may
god
who
has
thus
far
conducted
you
continue
to
do
so
and
may
the
british
navy
the
glory
and
support
of
our
country
be
restored
to
its
wonted
splendour
and
be
not
only
the
bulwark
of
britain
but
the
terror
of
the
world
but
this
can
only
be
effected
by
a
strict
adherence
to
our
duty
and
obedience
and
let
us
pray
that
the
almighty
god
may
keep
us
in
the
right
way
of
thinking
god
bless
you
all
at
an
address
so
unassuming
and
so
calculated
from
its
simplicity
and
truth
to
touch
the
human
heart
the
whole
ship
crew
were
melted
into
tears
and
declared
their
resolution
to
adhere
to
their
admiral
in
life
or
death
had
all
the
ships
in
the
fleet
been
commanded
by
such
men
as
admiral
duncan
the
mutiny
at
spithead
would
not
have
been
succeeded
by
that
at
the
nore
but
the
seamen
had
no
confidence
either
in
their
officers
or
in
those
who
presided
at
the
board
of
admiralty
and
distrust
of
their
promises
which
were
considered
to
be
given
merely
to
gain
time
was
the
occasion
of
the
second
and
more
alarming
rebellion
of
the
two
the
irritated
mind
of
peters
was
stimulated
to
join
the
disaffected
parties
his
pride
his
superior
education
and
the
acknowledgment
among
his
shipmates
that
he
was
an
injured
man
all
conspired
to
place
him
in
the
dangerous
situation
of
ringleader
on
board
of
his
own
ship
the
crew
of
which
although
it
had
not
actually
joined
in
the
mutiny
now
showed
open
signs
of
discontent
but
the
mine
was
soon
exploded
by
the
behaviour
of
the
captain
alarmed
at
the
mutinous
condition
of
the
other
ships
which
were
anchored
near
to
him
and
the
symptoms
of
dissatisfaction
in
his
own
he
proceeded
to
an
act
of
unjustifiable
severity
evidently
impelled
by
fear
and
not
by
resolution
he
ordered
several
of
the
petty
officers
and
leading
men
of
the
ship
to
be
thrown
into
irons
because
they
were
seen
to
be
earnestly
talking
together
on
the
forecastle
and
recollecting
that
his
conduct
towards
peters
had
been
such
as
to
warrant
disaffection
he
added
him
to
the
number
the
effect
of
this
injudicious
step
was
immediate
the
men
came
aft
in
a
body
on
the
and
requested
to
know
the
grounds
upon
which
peters
and
the
other
men
had
been
placed
in
confinement
and
perceiving
alarm
in
the
countenance
of
the
captain
notwithstanding
the
resolute
bearing
of
the
officers
they
insisted
upon
the
immediate
release
of
their
shipmates
thus
the
first
overt
act
of
mutiny
was
brought
on
by
the
misconduct
of
the
captain
the
officers
expostulated
and
threatened
in
vain
three
cheers
were
called
for
by
a
voice
in
the
crowd
and
three
cheers
were
immediately
given
the
marines
who
still
remained
true
to
their
allegiance
had
been
ordered
under
arms
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
ship
for
the
captain
trembling
and
confused
stood
a
mere
cipher
gave
the
order
for
the
ship
company
to
go
below
threatening
to
fire
upon
them
if
the
order
was
not
instantaneously
obeyed
the
captain
of
marines
brought
his
men
to
the
make
ready
and
they
were
about
to
present
when
the
first
lieutenant
waved
his
hand
to
stop
the
decided
measure
until
he
had
first
ascertained
how
far
the
mutiny
was
general
he
stepped
a
few
paces
forward
and
requested
that
every
blue
jacket
who
was
inclined
to
remain
faithful
to
his
king
and
country
would
walk
over
from
that
side
of
the
upon
which
the
ship
company
were
assembled
to
the
one
which
was
occupied
by
the
officers
and
marines
a
pause
and
silence
ensued
when
after
some
pushing
and
elbowing
through
the
crowd
william
adams
an
elderly
quartermaster
made
his
appearance
in
the
front
and
passed
over
to
the
side
where
the
officers
stood
while
the
hisses
of
the
rest
of
the
ship
company
expressed
their
disapprobation
of
his
conduct
the
old
man
just
reached
the
other
side
of
the
deck
when
turning
round
like
a
lion
at
bay
with
one
foot
on
the
the
hatchway
and
his
arm
raised
in
the
air
to
command
attention
he
addressed
them
in
these
few
words
my
lads
i
have
fought
for
my
king
years
and
have
been
too
long
in
his
service
to
turn
a
rebel
in
my
old
age
would
it
be
credited
that
after
the
mutiny
had
been
quelled
no
representation
of
this
conduct
was
made
to
government
by
his
captain
yet
such
was
the
case
and
such
was
the
gratitude
of
captain
a
the
example
shown
by
adams
was
not
followed
the
ship
crew
again
cheered
and
ran
down
the
hatchways
leaving
the
officers
and
marines
on
deck
they
first
disarmed
the
sentry
under
the
and
released
the
prisoners
and
then
went
forward
to
consult
upon
further
operations
they
were
not
long
in
deciding
a
boatswain
mate
who
was
one
of
the
ringleaders
piped
stand
by
hammocks
the
men
ran
on
deck
each
seizing
a
hammock
and
jumping
with
it
down
below
on
the
main
deck
the
object
of
this
manoeuvre
not
being
comprehended
they
were
suffered
to
execute
it
without
interruption
in
a
few
minutes
they
sent
up
the
marine
whom
they
had
disarmed
when
sentry
over
the
prisoners
to
state
that
they
wished
to
speak
to
the
captain
and
officers
who
after
some
discussion
agreed
that
they
would
descend
and
hear
the
proposals
which
the
ship
company
should
make
indeed
even
with
the
aid
of
the
marines
many
of
whom
were
wavering
resistance
would
now
have
been
useless
and
could
only
have
cost
them
their
lives
for
they
were
surrounded
by
other
ships
who
had
hoisted
the
flag
of
insubordination
and
whose
guns
were
trained
ready
to
pour
in
a
destructive
fire
on
the
least
sign
of
an
attempt
to
purchase
their
anchor
to
the
main
deck
they
consequently
repaired
the
scene
which
here
presented
itself
was
as
striking
as
it
was
novel
the
of
the
was
occupied
by
the
captain
and
officers
who
had
come
down
with
the
few
marines
who
still
continued
steadfast
to
their
duty
and
one
sailor
only
adams
who
had
so
nobly
stated
his
determination
on
the
the
foremost
part
of
the
deck
was
tenanted
by
a
noisy
and
tumultuous
throng
of
seamen
whose
heads
only
appeared
above
a
barricade
of
hammocks
which
they
had
formed
across
the
deck
and
out
of
which
at
two
embrasures
admirably
constructed
two
long
pounders
loaded
up
to
the
muzzle
with
grape
and
canister
shot
were
pointed
aft
in
the
direction
where
the
officers
and
marines
were
standing
a
man
at
the
breech
of
each
gun
with
a
match
in
his
hand
which
he
occasionally
blew
that
the
priming
powder
might
be
more
rapidly
ignited
stood
ready
for
the
signal
to
fire
the
captain
aghast
at
the
sight
would
have
retreated
but
the
officers
formed
of
sterner
materials
persuaded
him
to
stay
although
he
showed
such
evident
signs
of
fear
and
perturbation
as
seriously
to
injure
a
cause
in
which
resolution
and
presence
of
mind
alone
could
avail
the
mutineers
at
the
suggestion
of
peters
had
already
sent
aft
their
preliminary
proposals
which
were
that
the
officers
and
marines
should
surrender
up
their
arms
and
consider
themselves
under
an
arrest
intimating
at
the
same
time
that
the
first
step
in
advance
made
by
any
one
of
their
party
would
be
the
signal
for
applying
the
match
to
the
of
the
guns
there
was
a
pause
and
dead
silence
as
if
it
were
a
calm
although
every
passion
was
roused
and
on
the
alert
every
bosom
heaved
tumultuously
and
every
pulse
was
trebled
in
its
action
the
same
feeling
which
so
powerfully
affects
the
truant
schoolboy
who
aware
of
his
offence
and
dreading
the
punishment
in
perspective
can
scarce
enjoy
the
rapture
of
momentary
emancipation
acted
upon
the
mutineers
in
an
increased
ratio
proportioned
to
the
magnitude
of
their
stake
some
hearts
beat
with
remembrance
of
injuries
and
hopes
of
vengeance
and
retaliation
others
with
ambition
long
dormant
bursting
from
its
concealed
recess
and
many
were
actuated
by
that
restlessness
which
induced
them
to
consider
any
change
to
be
preferable
to
the
monotony
of
existence
in
compulsory
servitude
among
the
officers
some
were
oppressed
with
anxious
forebodings
of
evil
those
peculiar
sensations
which
when
death
approaches
nearly
to
the
outward
senses
alarm
the
heart
others
experienced
no
feeling
but
that
of
manly
fortitude
and
determination
to
die
if
necessary
like
men
in
others
alas
in
which
party
small
as
it
was
the
captain
was
fear
and
trepidation
amounted
almost
to
the
loss
of
reason
such
was
the
state
of
the
of
the
ship
at
the
moment
in
which
we
are
now
describing
it
to
the
reader
and
yet
in
the
very
centre
of
all
this
tumult
there
was
one
who
although
not
indifferent
to
the
scene
around
him
felt
interested
without
being
anxious
astonished
without
being
alarmed
between
the
contending
and
divided
parties
stood
a
little
boy
about
six
years
old
he
was
the
perfection
of
childish
beauty
chestnut
hair
waved
in
curls
on
his
forehead
health
glowed
on
his
rosy
cheeks
dimples
sported
over
his
face
as
he
altered
the
expression
of
his
countenance
and
his
large
dark
eyes
flashed
with
intelligence
and
animation
he
was
dressed
in
mimic
imitation
of
a
man
loose
trousers
tightened
at
the
hips
to
preclude
the
necessity
of
suspenders
and
a
white
duck
frock
with
long
sleeves
and
blue
collar
while
a
knife
attached
to
a
lanyard
was
suspended
round
his
neck
a
light
and
straw
hat
on
his
head
completed
his
attire
at
times
he
looked
aft
at
the
officers
and
marines
at
others
he
turned
his
eyes
forward
to
the
hammocks
behind
which
the
ship
company
were
assembled
the
sight
was
new
to
him
but
he
was
already
accustomed
to
reflect
much
and
to
ask
few
questions
go
to
the
officers
he
did
not
for
the
presence
of
the
captain
restrained
him
go
to
the
ship
company
he
could
not
for
the
barricade
of
hammocks
prevented
him
there
he
stood
in
wonderment
but
not
in
fear
there
was
something
beautiful
and
affecting
in
the
situation
of
the
boy
calm
when
all
around
him
was
anxious
tumult
thoughtless
when
the
brains
of
others
were
oppressed
with
the
accumulation
of
ideas
contented
where
all
was
discontent
peaceful
where
each
party
that
he
stood
between
was
thirsting
for
each
other
blood
there
he
stood
the
only
happy
the
only
innocent
one
amongst
hundreds
swayed
by
jarring
interests
and
contending
passions
and
yet
he
was
in
keeping
although
in
such
strong
contrast
with
the
rest
of
the
picture
for
where
is
the
instance
of
the
human
mind
being
so
thoroughly
depraved
as
not
to
have
one
good
feeling
left
nothing
exists
so
base
and
vile
as
not
to
have
one
redeeming
quality
there
is
no
poison
without
some
antidote
no
precipice
however
barren
without
some
trace
of
verdure
no
desert
however
vast
without
some
spring
to
refresh
the
parched
traveller
some
oasis
some
green
spot
which
from
its
situation
in
comparison
with
surrounding
objects
appears
almost
heavenly
and
thus
did
the
boy
look
almost
angelic
standing
as
he
did
between
the
angry
exasperated
parties
on
the
of
the
disorganised
ship
after
some
little
time
he
walked
forward
and
leaned
against
one
of
the
pounders
that
was
pointed
out
of
the
embrasure
the
muzzle
of
which
was
on
a
level
with
and
intercepted
by
his
little
head
adams
the
observing
the
dangerous
situation
of
the
child
stepped
forward
this
was
against
the
stipulations
laid
down
by
the
mutineers
and
peters
cried
out
to
him
adams
or
we
fire
adams
waved
his
hand
in
expostulation
and
continued
to
advance
keep
back
again
cried
peters
or
by
god
we
fire
not
upon
one
old
man
peters
and
he
unarmed
replied
adams
i
not
worth
so
much
powder
and
shot
the
man
at
the
gun
blew
his
match
for
god
sake
for
your
own
sake
as
you
value
your
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
do
not
fire
peters
cried
adams
with
energy
or
you
never
forgive
yourself
hold
fast
the
match
said
peters
we
need
not
fear
our
man
and
as
he
said
this
adams
had
come
up
to
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
and
seized
the
boy
whom
he
snatched
up
in
his
arms
i
only
came
forward
peters
to
save
your
own
boy
whose
head
would
have
been
blown
to
atoms
if
you
had
chanced
to
have
fired
the
gun
said
adams
turning
short
round
and
walking
aft
with
the
boy
in
his
arms
god
in
heaven
bless
you
adams
cried
peters
with
a
faltering
voice
and
casting
a
look
of
fond
affection
at
the
child
the
heart
of
the
mutineer
was
at
that
moment
softened
by
parental
feelings
and
he
blew
the
priming
off
the
of
the
gun
lest
an
accidental
spark
should
risk
the
life
of
his
child
who
was
now
aft
with
the
officers
and
their
party

this
little
boy

a
fortress
of
stone
or
the
more
dangerous
one
of
public
opinion
when
failure
in
the
one
case
may
precipitate
them
on
the
sword
and
in
the
other
consign
them
to
the
scaffold
in
this
mutiny
there
were
but
few
of
the
rare
class
referred
to
above
in
the
ship
whose
movements
we
have
been
describing
not
one
perhaps
except
peters
there
were
many
boisterous
many
threatening
but
no
one
except
him
who
was
equal
to
the
command
or
to
whom
the
command
could
have
been
confided
he
was
on
board
of
his
own
ship
the
very
life
and
soul
of
the
mutiny
at
the
moment
described
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
all
the
better
feelings
of
his
still
virtuous
heart
were
in
action
and
by
a
captain
possessing
resolution
and
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
the
mutiny
might
have
been
suppressed
but
captain
a
who
perceived
the
anxiety
of
peters
thought
the
child
a
prize
of
no
small
value
and
as
adams
brought
him
aft
snatched
the
boy
from
his
arms
and
desired
two
of
the
party
of
marines
to
turn
their
loaded
muskets
at
his
young
heart
thus
intimating
to
the
mutineers
that
he
would
shoot
the
child
at
the
first
sign
of
hostility
on
their
part
the
two
marines
who
had
received
this
order
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
and
did
not
obey
it
was
repeated
by
the
captain
who
considered
that
he
had
hit
upon
a
masterpiece
of
diplomacy
the
officers
expostulated
the
officer
commanding
the
party
of
marines
turned
away
in
disgust
but
in
vain
the
brutal
order
was
reiterated
with
threats
the
whole
party
of
marines
now
murmured
and
consulted
together
in
a
low
tone
willy
peters
was
the
idol
and
plaything
of
the
whole
crew
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
remain
on
board
with
his
father
and
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
ship
who
would
not
have
risked
his
life
to
have
saved
that
of
the
child
the
effect
of
this
impolitic
and
cruel
order
was
decisive
the
marines
with
the
sergeant
at
their
head
and
little
willy
placed
in
security
in
the
centre
their
bayonets
directed
on
the
defensive
towards
the
captain
and
officers
retreated
to
the
mutineers
whom
they
joined
with
three
cheers
as
the
child
was
lifted
over
the
barricade
of
hammocks
and
received
into
his
father
arms
we
must
now
submit
to
their
terms
sir
said
the
first
lieutenant
any
terms
any
terms
answered
the
terrified
captain
tell
them
so
for
god
sake
or
they
will
fire
adams
go
forward
and
tell
them
we
submit
this
order
was
however
unnecessary
for
the
mutineers
aware
of
the
impossibility
of
any
further
resistance
had
thrown
down
the
barricade
of
hammocks
and
with
peters
at
their
head
were
coming
aft
you
consent
gentlemen
to
consider
yourselves
under
an
arrest
inquired
peters
of
the
first
lieutenant
and
officers
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
captain
we
do
we
do
cried
captain
a
i
hope
you
will
not
stain
your
hands
with
blood
mr
peters
i
meant
the
child
no
harm
if
you
had
murdered
him
captain
a
you
could
not
have
injured
him
so
much
as
you
have
injured
his
father
retorted
peters
but
fear
not
for
your
life
sir
that
is
safe
and
you
will
meet
all
the
respect
and
attention
to
your
wants
that
circumstances
will
permit
we
war
not
with
individuals
it
was
a
proud
moment
for
peters
to
see
this
man
cringing
before
him
and
receiving
with
thanks
the
promise
of
his
life
from
one
whom
he
had
so
cruelly
treated
there
was
a
glorious
revenge
in
it
the
full
force
of
which
could
only
be
felt
by
the
granting
not
the
receiving
party
for
it
could
only
be
appreciated
by
one
who
possessed
those
fine
and
honourable
feelings
of
which
captain
a
was
wholly
destitute
if
the
reader
will
consult
the
various
records
of
the
times
which
we
are
now
describing
he
will
find
that
every
respect
was
personally
paid
to
the
officers
although
they
were
deprived
of
their
arms
some
of
the
most
obnoxious
were
sent
on
shore
and
the
intemperate
conduct
of
others
produced
effects
for
which
they
had
only
to
thank
themselves
but
on
the
whole
the
remark
made
by
peters
was
strictly
correct
they
warred
not
with
individuals
they
demanded
justice
from
an
ungrateful
country
it
is
true
that
the
demands
in
this
mutiny
were
not
so
reasonable
as
in
the
preceding
but
where
is
the
who
can
confine
himself
to
the
exact
balance
of
justice
when
his
own
feelings
are
unwittingly
thrown
into
the
scale
as
i
before
stated
it
is
not
my
intention
to
follow
up
the
details
of
this
national
disgrace
but
merely
to
confine
myself
to
that
part
which
is
connected
with
the
present
history
peters
as
delegate
from
his
ship
met
the
others
who
were
daily
assembled
by
parker
directions
on
board
of
the
and
took
a
leading
and
decided
part
in
the
arrangements
of
the
disaffected
fleet
but
parker
the
ringleader
although
a
man
of
talent
was
not
equal
to
the
task
he
had
undertaken
he
lost
sight
of
several
important
features
necessary
to
insure
success
in
all
civil
commotions
such
as
rapidity
and
decision
of
action
constant
employment
being
found
and
continual
excitement
being
kept
up
amongst
his
followers
to
afford
no
time
for
reflection
those
who
serve
under
an
established
government
know
exactly
their
present
weight
in
the
scale
of
worldly
rank
and
the
extent
of
their
future
expectations
they
have
accustomed
themselves
to
bound
their
ambition
accordingly
and
feeling
conscious
that
passive
obedience
is
the
surest
road
to
advancement
are
led
quietly
here
or
there
to
be
slaughtered
at
the
will
and
caprice
of
their
superiors
but
the
leader
of
the
disaffected
against
an
established
government
has
a
difficult
task
he
has
nothing
to
offer
to
his
followers
but
promises
there
is
nothing
on
hand
all
is
expectation
if
allowed
time
for
reflection
they
soon
perceive
that
they
are
acting
an
humble
part
in
a
dangerous
game
and
that
even
though
it
be
attended
with
success
in
all
probability
they
will
receive
no
share
of
the
advantages
although
certain
of
incurring
a
large
proportion
of
the
risk
the
leader
of
a
connected
force
of
the
above
description
rises
to
a
dangerous
height
when
borne
up
by
the
excitement
of
the
time
but
let
it
once
be
permitted
to
subside
and
like
the
aeronaut
in
his
balloon
from
which
the
gas
escapes
while
it
is
soaring
in
the
clouds
he
is
precipitated
from
his
lofty
station
and
gravitates
to
his
own
destruction
he
must
be
a
wonderful
man
who
can
collect
all
the
resources
of
a
popular
commotion
and
bring
it
to
a
successful
issue
the
reason
is
obvious
everything
depends
upon
the
leader
alone
his
followers
are
but
as
the
stones
composing
the
arch
of
the
bridge
by
which
the
gulf
is
to
be
crossed
between
them
and
their
nominal
superiors
he
is
the
keystone
upon
which
the
whole
depends
if
completely
fitted
rendering
the
arch
durable
and
capable
of
bearing
any
pressure
but
if
too
small
in
dimensions
or
imperfect
in
conformation
rendering
the
whole
labour
futile
and
occasioning
all
the
fabric
previously
raised
to
be
precipitated
by
its
own
weight
and
dispersed
in
ruin
and
confusion
this
latter
was
the
fate
of
the
mutiny
at
the
nore
the
insurrection
was
quelled
and
the
ringleaders
were
doomed
to
undergo
the
utmost
penalty
of
martial
law
among
the
rest
peters
was
sentenced
to
death
in
the
foremost
part
of
the
of
a
ship
in
a
square
room
strongly
and
receiving
light
from
one
of
the
ports
as
firmly
secured
with
an
iron
grating
with
no
other
furniture
than
a
long
wooden
form
his
legs
in
shackles
that
ran
upon
a
heavy
iron
bar
lying
on
the
deck
sat
the
unfortunate
prisoner
in
company
with
three
other
individuals
his
wife
his
child
and
old
adams
the
quartermaster
peters
was
seated
on
the
deck
supporting
himself
by
leaning
against
the
bulkhead
his
wife
was
lying
beside
him
with
her
face
hidden
in
his
lap
adams
occupied
the
form
and
the
child
stood
between
his
knees
all
were
silent
and
the
eyes
of
the
three
were
directed
towards
one
of
the
sad
company
who
appeared
more
wretched
and
disconsolate
than
the
rest
my
dear
dear
ellen
said
peters
mournfully
as
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
convulsed
her
attenuated
frame
why
then
refuse
my
solicitations
edward
if
not
for
yourself
listen
to
me
for
the
sake
of
your
wife
and
child
irritated
as
your
father
still
may
be
his
dormant
affection
will
be
awakened
when
he
is
acquainted
with
the
dreadful
situation
of
his
only
son
nay
his
family
pride
will
never
permit
that
you
should
perish
by
so
ignominious
a
death
and
your
assumed
name
will
enable
him
without
blushing
to
exert
his
interest
and
obtain
your
reprieve
do
not
put
me
to
the
pain
of
again
refusing
you
my
dearest
ellen
i
desire
to
die
and
my
fate
must
be
a
warning
to
others
when
i
reflect
what
dreadful
consequences
might
have
ensued
to
the
country
from
our
rebellious
proceedings
i
am
thankful
truly
thankful
to
god
that
we
did
not
succeed
i
know
what
you
would
urge
my
wrongs
my
undeserved
stripes
i
too
would
urge
them
and
when
my
conscience
has
pressed
me
hard
have
urged
them
in
palliation
but
i
feel
that
it
is
only
in
palliation
not
in
justification
that
they
can
be
brought
forward
they
are
no
more
in
comparison
with
my
crime
than
the
happiness
of
one
individual
is
to
that
of
the
nation
which
i
assisted
to
endanger
because
one
constituting
a
part
of
it
had
unauthorised
oppressed
me
no
no
ellen
i
should
not
be
happy
if
i
were
not
to
atone
for
my
faults
and
this
wretched
life
is
the
only
atonement
i
can
offer
but
for
you
and
that
poor
child
my
dearest
and
kindest
i
should
go
to
the
scaffold
rejoicing
but
the
thoughts
o
god
strengthen
and
support
me
cried
the
unhappy
man
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
fear
not
for
me
edward
i
feel
here
said
ellen
laying
her
hand
on
her
heart
a
conviction
that
we
shall
soon
meet
again
i
will
urge
you
no
more
love
but
the
boy
the
boy
oh
edward
what
will
become
of
that
dear
boy
when
we
are
both
gone
please
god
to
spare
my
life
he
never
want
a
father
said
old
adams
as
the
tears
found
a
devious
passage
down
the
furrows
of
his
face
what
will
become
of
him
cried
peters
with
energy
why
he
shall
retrieve
his
father
faults
wash
out
the
stain
in
his
character
he
shall
prove
as
liege
a
subject
as
i
have
been
a
rebellious
one
he
shall
as
faithfully
serve
his
country
as
i
have
shamefully
deserted
it
he
shall
be
as
honest
as
i
have
been
false
and
oh
may
he
be
as
prosperous
as
i
have
been
unfortunate
as
happy
as
i
have
been
miserable
come
hither
boy
by
the
fond
hopes
i
entertain
of
pardon
and
peace
above
by
the
almighty
in
whose
presence
i
must
shortly
tremble
i
here
devote
thee
to
thy
country
serve
her
bravely
and
faithfully
tell
me
willy
do
you
understand
me
and
will
you
promise
me
this
the
boy
laid
his
head
upon
his
father
shoulder
and
answered
in
a
low
tone
i
will
and
then
after
a
short
pause
added
but
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
you
father
i
am
going
to
die
for
my
country
good
my
child
if
god
wills
it
may
you
do
the
same
but
in
a
more
honourable
manner
the
boy
seemed
lost
in
thought
and
after
a
short
time
quitted
his
father
side
and
sat
down
on
the
deck
by
his
mother
without
speaking
adams
rose
and
taking
him
up
said
mayhap
you
have
that
to
talk
of
which
wants
no
listeners
i
will
take
willy
with
me
and
give
him
a
little
air
before
i
put
him
in
his
hammock
it
but
a
close
hole
this
good
night
to
you
both
though
i
afeard
that
but
a
wish
but
a
wish
indeed
and
it
was
the
last
that
was
ever
to
close
upon
the
unhappy
peters
the
next
morning
was
appointed
for
his
execution
there
are
scenes
of
such
consummate
misery
that
they
can
not
be
portrayed
without
harrowing
up
the
feelings
of
the
reader
and
of
these
the
climax
may
be
found
in
a
fond
wife
lying
at
the
feet
of
her
husband
during
the
last
twelve
hours
of
his
mortal
career
we
must
draw
the
curtain
and
now
reader
the
title
of
this
work
which
may
have
puzzled
you
will
be
explained
for
intelligible
as
it
may
be
to
our
profession
it
may
be
a
mystery
to
those
who
are
not
in
his
majesty
service
the
arrow
was
a
mark
assumed
at
the
time
of
the
edwards
when
it
was
considered
the
most
powerful
weapon
of
attack
as
distinguishing
the
property
of
the
king
and
this
mark
has
been
continued
down
to
the
present
day
every
article
supplied
to
his
majesty
service
from
the
arsenals
and
dockyards
is
thickly
studded
with
this
mark
and
to
be
found
in
possession
of
any
property
so
marked
is
a
capital
offence
as
it
designates
that
property
to
be
the
when
adams
left
the
condemned
cell
with
willy
he
thought
upon
what
had
passed
and
as
peters
had
devoted
the
boy
to
his
king
and
country
he
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
mark
him
the
practice
of
tatooing
is
very
common
in
the
navy
and
you
will
see
a
sailor
arm
covered
with
emblems
from
the
shoulder
to
the
wrist
his
own
initials
that
of
his
sweetheart
the
crucifix
neptune
and
mermaids
being
huddled
together
as
if
mythology
and
scripture
were
one
and
the
same
thing
adams
was
not
long
in
deciding
and
telling
our
little
hero
that
his
father
wished
it
he
easily
persuaded
him
to
undergo
the
pain
of
the
operation
which
was
performed
on
the
forecastle
by
pricking
the
shape
of
the
figure
required
with
the
points
of
needles
and
rubbing
the
bleeding
parts
with
wet
gunpowder
and
ink
by
these
simple
means
the
form
of
a
arrow
or
the
king
mark
was
in
the
course
of
an
hour
indelibly
engraved
upon
the
left
shoulder
of
little
willy
who
was
then
consigned
to
his
hammock
chapter
four
the
strife
was
the
vanquish
had
their
doom
the
mutineers
were
crush
dispersed
or
or
lived
to
deem
the
happiest
were
the
slain
byron
the
day
broke
serenely
but
brightly
and
poured
in
a
stream
of
light
through
the
iron
grating
of
the
cell
where
peters
and
his
wife
lay
clasped
in
each
other
arms
not
asleep
but
torpid
and
worn
out
with
extreme
suffering
peters
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
and
gently
moved
ellen
as
he
called
her
by
her
name
she
had
not
for
some
time
lifted
up
her
head
which
was
buried
in
his
bosom
and
she
was
not
aware
that
the
darkness
had
been
dispelled
she
raised
her
head
at
his
summons
and
as
the
dazzling
light
burst
upon
her
sunken
eyes
so
did
the
recollection
that
this
was
the
fatal
morning
flash
upon
her
memory
with
a
shriek
she
again
buried
her
face
in
the
bosom
of
her
husband
ellen
as
you
love
me
said
peters
do
not
distress
me
in
my
last
hour
i
have
yet
much
to
do
before
i
die
and
require
your
assistance
and
support
rise
my
love
and
let
me
write
to
my
father
i
must
not
neglect
the
interest
of
our
child
she
rose
tremblingly
and
turning
back
from
her
face
her
beautiful
hair
which
had
been
for
so
many
days
neglected
and
was
now
moistened
with
her
tears
reached
the
materials
required
by
her
husband
who
drawing
towards
him
the
wooden
form
to
serve
him
as
a
table
wrote
the
following
letter
while
his
wife
sat
by
him
with
a
countenance
of
idiotic
apathy
and
despair
dear
father
yes
still
father
before
you
cast
your
eyes
upon
these
characters
you
will
be
childless
your
eldest
boy
perished
nobly
in
the
field
of
honour
your
youngest
and
last
will
this
morning
meet
an
ignominious
but
deserved
death
on
the
scaffold
thus
will
you
be
childless
but
if
your
son
does
meet
the
fate
of
a
traitor
still
the
secret
is
confined
to
you
alone
and
none
will
imagine
that
the
unhappy
peters
ringleader
of
a
mutinous
ship
was
the
scion
of
a
race
who
have
so
long
preserved
an
unblemished
name
fain
would
i
have
spared
you
this
shock
to
your
feelings
and
have
allowed
you
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
my
disgrace
but
i
have
an
act
of
duty
to
perform
to
you
and
to
my
child
towards
you
that
your
estates
may
not
be
claimed
and
pass
away
to
distant
and
collateral
branches
towards
my
child
that
he
may
eventually
reclaim
his
rights
father
i
forgive
you
i
might
say
but
no
let
all
now
be
buried
in
oblivion
and
as
you
peruse
these
lines
and
think
on
my
unhappy
fate
shed
a
tear
in
memory
of
the
once
happy
child
you
fondled
on
your
knee
and
say
to
your
heart
forgive
him
i
have
dedicated
my
boy
to
his
king
and
country
if
you
forgive
me
and
mean
to
protect
your
grandchild
do
not
change
the
career
in
life
marked
out
for
him
it
is
a
solemn
compact
between
my
god
and
me
and
you
must
fulfil
this
last
earnest
request
of
a
dying
man
as
you
hope
for
future
pardon
and
bliss
his
distracted
mother
sits
by
me
i
would
entreat
you
to
extend
your
kindness
towards
her
but
i
fear
she
will
soon
require
no
earthly
aid
still
soothe
her
last
moments
with
a
promise
to
protect
the
orphan
and
may
god
bless
you
for
your
kindness
your
affectionate
son
edward
peters
had
scarcely
finished
this
letter
when
adams
with
the
boy
in
his
arms
was
admitted
i
come
for
final
orders
peters
and
to
tell
you
what
i
did
last
night
to
this
boy
he
is
real
stuff
never
winced
you
said
he
was
to
be
the
king
and
i
thought
you
would
like
that
he
should
be
marked
as
such
there
is
no
mistaking
this
mark
peters
continued
adams
baring
the
boy
shoulder
and
showing
the
impression
of
the
arrow
which
now
appeared
angry
and
inflamed
as
it
always
is
for
some
days
after
the
operation
i
did
not
mention
that
i
was
going
to
do
it
because
ellen
then
might
not
have
liked
it
but
i
hope
you
do
many
many
thanks
answered
peters
and
opening
his
letter
which
was
folded
but
not
sealed
he
added
a
postscript
pointing
out
the
mark
by
which
the
boy
would
be
identified
you
could
not
have
done
me
a
greater
favour
adams
and
now
you
must
promise
me
one
more
which
is
to
look
after
my
poor
ellen
when
i
understand
my
good
fellow
and
i
will
replied
adams
there
is
the
chaplain
outside
who
is
all
ready
for
service
if
you
would
like
to
see
him
continued
the
old
man
passing
his
hands
over
his
humid
eyes
ask
him
to
come
in
adams
he
is
a
good
man
and
an
honour
to
his
profession
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
adams
went
to
the
door
and
soon
returned
with
the
chaplain
he
saluted
peters
who
respectfully
bowed
to
him
and
said
i
have
long
made
my
peace
with
god
and
man
sir
and
am
as
well
prepared
to
die
as
sinful
mortal
can
be
in
faith
and
charity
with
all
men
many
thanks
to
you
sir
for
your
kindness
but
sir
you
may
be
of
use
here
yet
can
you
and
his
voice
faltered
can
you
sir
help
that
poor
young
woman
can
not
you
reason
her
into
some
kind
of
tranquillity
some
degree
of
submission
to
god
will
oh
do
that
sir
and
you
will
confer
a
favour
on
me
indeed
the
chaplain
approached
ellen
who
lay
on
the
deck
in
a
state
of
mental
stupefaction
and
addressing
her
in
mild
accents
persuaded
her
to
rise
and
take
a
seat
on
the
form
he
kindly
contrived
to
bring
it
forward
to
the
port
so
that
she
could
not
witness
the
motions
of
peters
and
with
a
low
yet
energetic
and
persuasive
voice
attempted
to
reason
her
into
patience
and
resignation
his
efforts
were
in
vain
she
occasionally
looked
upon
him
with
a
vacant
stare
but
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
during
the
period
peters
had
time
to
shave
himself
and
dress
in
clean
attire
preparatory
to
being
summoned
to
his
fate
the
time
was
approaching
fast
one
bell
after
eight
designating
the
half
hour
had
struck
at
two
bells
nine
he
was
to
be
summoned
to
his
doom
the
clergyman
rose
from
his
useless
endeavours
let
us
pray
said
he
and
sank
upon
his
knees
peters
adams
and
the
child
followed
his
example
and
last
of
all
poor
ellen
who
seemed
to
recover
her
recollection
sank
on
her
knees
but
unable
to
keep
her
position
fell
towards
the
clergyman
who
as
he
supported
her
in
his
arms
poured
forth
a
fervent
and
eloquent
appeal
in
behalf
of
the
one
who
was
about
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
his
maker
and
of
those
who
were
left
in
tribulation
behind
it
was
scarcely
over
when
the
door
opened
and
the
claimed
his
prisoner
the
prayer
of
the
chaplain
seemed
to
ring
in
ellen
ears
and
she
remained
supported
by
the
worthy
man
muttering
parts
of
it
at
intervals
during
which
time
the
limbs
of
her
husband
were
freed
from
the
shackles
all
was
ready
and
peters
straining
the
child
to
his
bosom
in
silence
and
casting
one
look
at
his
dear
ellen
who
still
remained
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
denied
himself
a
last
embrace
though
the
effort
wrung
his
heart
rather
than
awaken
her
to
her
misery
he
quitted
the
cell
and
the
chaplain
quietly
placing
ellen
in
the
arms
of
adams
followed
that
he
might
attend
and
support
peters
in
his
last
moments
the
prisoner
was
conducted
on
the
previously
to
being
sent
forward
to
execution
his
sentence
was
read
by
captain
a
and
the
remark
may
perhaps
be
considered
uncharitable
but
there
certainly
appeared
to
be
an
satisfaction
in
his
countenance
as
he
came
to
that
part
where
it
stated
that
the
prisoner
was
to
suffer
death
peters
heard
it
read
with
firmness
and
asked
permission
to
address
the
ship
company
this
was
at
first
refused
by
the
captain
but
at
the
request
of
the
officers
and
the
assurance
of
the
chaplain
that
he
would
vouch
for
the
language
of
peters
being
such
as
would
have
a
proper
tendency
to
future
subordination
on
the
part
of
the
company
it
was
assented
to
bowing
first
to
the
captain
and
officers
peters
turned
to
the
ship
company
who
were
assembled
on
the
booms
and
gangway
and
addressed
them
as
follows
shipmates
the
time
may
come
when
our
country
shall
be
at
peace
and
your
services
no
longer
be
required
then
when
you
narrate
to
your
children
the
events
of
this
unhappy
mutiny
do
not
forget
to
add
instruction
to
amusement
by
pointing
out
to
them
that
it
ended
in
the
disgrace
and
death
of
the
ringleaders
tell
them
that
in
your
presence
one
of
them
acknowledged
on
the
the
justice
of
his
sentence
and
returned
thanks
to
his
majesty
for
his
kindness
in
pardoning
others
who
had
been
led
into
the
same
error
tell
them
to
do
their
duty
to
fight
nobly
for
their
king
and
country
and
warn
them
by
our
example
at
this
moment
willy
who
had
eluded
the
vigilance
of
old
adams
who
was
occupied
in
supporting
the
inanimate
ellen
pushed
his
way
between
the
legs
of
the
marines
who
were
drawn
up
in
ranks
on
the
and
running
to
his
father
laid
hold
of
the
loose
sailor
trousers
in
which
he
was
attired
and
looked
anxiously
and
inquisitively
in
his
face
peters
voice
faltered
he
attempted
to
continue
his
address
to
the
men
but
could
not
and
waiving
his
hand
and
pointing
to
the
child
in
mute
explanation
of
the
cause
after
struggling
in
vain
against
the
overflowings
of
a
father
heart
he
bent
over
the
boy
and
burst
into
tears
the
effect
was
electrical
the
shock
was
communicated
to
all
not
an
eye
but
was
dimmed
sobs
were
heard
in
the
crowd
the
oldest
officers
turned
away
to
conceal
their
emotions
the
younger
and
more
fresh
in
heart
covered
their
faces
and
leant
against
the
bulwarks
the
marines
forgot
their
discipline
and
raised
their
hands
from
their
sides
to
wipe
their
eyes
many
a
source
long
supposed
to
be
hermetically
sealed
was
many
a
spring
long
dry
reflowed
rapidly
even
captain
a
was
moved
by
a
singular
coincidence
the
grouping
of
the
parties
at
this
moment
was
nearly
the
same
as
when
we
first
introduced
our
little
hero
to
the
reader
the
officers
and
marines
on
the
after
part
of
the
deck
the
ship
company
forward
and
little
willy
standing
between
the
two
again
he
appears
in
the
same
position
but
what
a
change
of
feeling
had
taken
place
as
if
he
had
been
a
little
spirit
of
good
waving
his
fairy
talisman
evil
passions
which
in
the
former
scene
were
let
loose
had
retired
to
their
darkest
recesses
and
all
the
better
feelings
of
humanity
were
called
forth
and
displayed
in
one
universal
spontaneous
and
unfeigned
tribute
to
the
melancholy
and
affecting
scene
the
silence
was
first
broken
by
willy
where
are
you
going
father
and
why
do
you
wear
that
i
am
going
to
sleep
child
to
an
eternal
sleep
god
bless
and
protect
you
said
peters
taking
him
up
and
kissing
him
and
now
sir
i
am
ready
continued
peters
who
had
recovered
his
captain
a
i
forgive
you
as
i
trust
to
be
forgiven
myself
mr
said
he
addressing
the
take
this
child
by
the
hand
and
do
not
permit
him
to
come
forward
remember
he
is
the
own
then
bowing
to
the
chaplain
who
had
scarcely
recovered
from
the
effects
that
the
scene
had
produced
upon
him
and
looking
significantly
at
the
peters
bent
his
steps
forward
by
the
gangway
the
noose
was
fastened
the
gun
fired
and
in
a
moment
all
was
over
loud
as
was
the
report
of
the
gun
those
who
were
appointed
to
the
unpleasant
duty
of
running
aft
with
the
rope
on
the
which
swung
peters
to
the
heard
a
shriek
that
even
that
deafening
noise
could
not
overpower
it
was
the
soul
of
ellen
joining
that
of
her
husband
and
before
the
day
closed
their
bodies
were
consigned
to
the
same
grave
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
chapter
five
lord
of
himself
that
heritage
of
woe
byron
our
novel
may
to
a
certain
degree
be
compared
to
one
of
the
pantomimes
which
rival
theatres
annually
bring
forth
for
the
amusement
of
the
holiday
children
we
open
with
dark
and
solemn
scenes
introducing
occasionally
a
bright
image
which
appears
with
the
greater
lustre
from
the
contrast
around
it
and
thus
we
proceed
until
harlequin
is
fairly
provided
with
his
wand
and
despatched
to
seek
his
adventures
by
land
and
by
sea
to
complete
the
parallel
the
whole
should
wind
up
with
a
blaze
of
light
and
beauty
till
our
dazzled
eyes
are
relieved
and
the
illusion
disappears
at
the
fall
of
the
green
curtain
which
like
the
finis
at
the
end
of
the
third
volume
tells
us
that
all
is
over
we
must
however
be
allowed
to
recapitulate
a
little
in
this
chapter
previously
to
launching
our
hero
upon
the
uncertain
and
boisterous
sea
of
human
life
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
correct
development
of
the
piece
that
the
attention
of
the
reader
should
be
called
to
the
history
of
the
grandfather
of
our
hero
admiral
de
courcy
was
the
lineal
descendant
of
an
ancient
and
wealthy
family
of
high
aristocratic
connection
he
had
the
misfortune
at
an
early
age
to
lose
his
father
to
be
an
only
child
and
to
have
a
very
weak
and
doting
mother
add
to
all
these
that
he
was
the
heir
to
a
large
entailed
property
and
the
reader
will
acknowledge
that
even
the
best
disposed
child
stood
a
fair
chance
of
being
spoiled
but
young
de
courcy
was
not
a
child
he
was
of
a
violent
headstrong
and
selfish
disposition
and
was
not
easily
to
be
checked
by
the
firmest
hand
he
advanced
to
man
estate
the
cruel
tyrant
of
a
fond
and
foolish
mother
and
the
dislike
of
all
around
him
his
restless
disposition
backed
by
the
persuasions
of
his
mother
to
the
contrary
induced
him
to
enter
into
the
naval
service
at
the
time
we
are
now
describing
the
name
of
the
boy
often
appeared
on
the
books
of
a
when
the
boy
himself
was
at
school
or
at
home
with
his
friends
if
there
were
any
regulations
to
the
contrary
they
were
easily
surmounted
by
interest
the
consequence
was
that
without
any
knowledge
of
his
profession
without
having
commenced
his
career
by
learning
to
obey
before
he
was
permitted
to
command
at
the
early
age
of
eighteen
years
young
de
courcy
was
appointed
captain
of
a
fine
frigate
and
as
the
power
of
a
captain
of
a
was
at
that
time
almost
without
limit
and
his
conduct
without
scrutiny
he
had
but
too
favourable
an
opportunity
of
indulging
his
tyrannical
propensities
his
caprice
and
violence
were
unbounded
his
cruelty
odious
and
his
ship
was
designated
by
the
sobriquet
of
hell
there
are
however
limits
to
the
longest
tether
and
as
no
officer
would
remain
in
the
ship
and
the
desertion
of
the
men
became
so
extensive
that
a
fine
frigate
lay
useless
and
unmanned
the
government
at
last
perceived
the
absolute
necessity
of
depriving
of
command
one
who
could
not
command
himself
the
ship
was
paid
off
and
even
the
interest
of
captain
de
courcy
powerful
as
it
was
could
not
obtain
further
employment
for
him
having
for
some
time
been
in
possession
of
his
large
property
captain
de
courcy
retired
to
the
hall
of
his
ancestors
with
feelings
of
anger
against
the
government
which
his
vindictive
temper
prompted
him
to
indulge
by
the
annoyance
of
all
around
him
and
instead
of
diffusing
joy
and
comfort
by
the
expenditure
of
his
wealth
he
rendered
himself
odious
by
avarice
a
vice
the
more
contemptible
as
it
was
unexpected
at
so
early
an
age
but
much
as
he
was
an
object
of
abhorrence
he
was
more
an
object
of
pity
with
a
handsome
exterior
and
with
fascinating
manners
of
high
birth
and
connections
with
a
splendid
fortune
in
short
with
every
supposed
advantage
that
the
world
could
give
he
was
through
the
injudicious
conduct
of
a
fond
mother
whose
heart
he
had
broken
the
most
miserable
of
beings
he
was
without
society
for
he
was
shunned
by
the
resident
gentlemen
in
the
neighbourhood
even
mothers
with
hearts
indurated
by
interest
and
with
a
string
of
tall
daughters
to
provide
for
thought
the
sacrifice
too
great
and
shuddered
at
an
alliance
with
captain
de
courcy
avoided
by
the
tenants
of
his
large
estates
whose
misfortunes
met
with
no
compassion
and
whose
inability
to
answer
the
demands
of
the
were
followed
up
with
immediate
distress
and
seizure
abhorred
by
his
own
household
who
if
their
services
were
not
required
vanished
at
his
approach
or
if
summoned
entered
the
door
of
his
room
trembling
he
was
an
isolated
and
unhappy
being
a
torment
to
himself
and
to
others
wise
indeed
was
solomon
when
he
wrote
that
he
who
spared
the
rod
spoiled
the
child
the
monotony
of
a
life
whose
sole
negative
enjoyment
consisted
in
the
persecution
of
others
induced
captain
de
courcy
to
make
occasional
excursions
to
the
different
and
whether
that
to
a
certain
degree
he
was
schooled
by
banishment
from
society
at
home
or
that
he
had
no
opportunity
of
displaying
his
diabolical
temper
his
prepossessing
appearance
and
riches
made
him
a
great
favourite
in
these
marts
for
beauty
an
amiable
girl
was

acquiesced

she

was
miserable
until
released
from
her
heedless
engagement
by
death
there
are
those
who
excuse
a
violent
temper
in
a
man
and
consider
it
no
obstacle
to
happiness
in
the
marriage
life
alas
may
they
never
discover
the
fatal
error
in
their
own

with
the
and

fondly
attached

those
who
will
lavish
every

acknowledge
their
fault
and
make
every
subsequent
effort
to
compensate
for
the

of

must
prove

bane
of

bitter
and
insulting
expressions
have
escaped
unheeded
at

time
and
forgotten
by
the
offending
party
but
although
forgiven
never
to
be

by
the

like

they
have
entered
into

heart
of

he
had
promised
before

to
love
and
to
cherish
and

there
they
must

may
pour

into

wounds
and

them
for

and
while

them
with

the
heat
and

may
be
unperceived

passion
again
asserts
his

upon
his
rude
attack
these

angels
are
forced
from

kind
devoted
woman
looks
inwardly
with
despair
upon
her
wounded
and
festering
heart
hurried
as
she
was
to
an
early
tomb
the
unfortunate
wife
of
captain
de
courcy
had
still
time
to
present
him
with
two
fine
boys
whose
infantine
endearments
soothed
his
violence
and
as
long
as
they
showed
no
spirit
of
resistance
they
were
alternately
fondled
and
frightened
but
children
are
not
blind
and
the
scenes
which
continually
occurred
between
their
parents
the
tears
of
their
mother
and
the
remarks
made
in
their
presence
by
the
domestics
soon
taught
them
to
view
their
father
with
dread
captain
de
courcy
perceived
that
he
was
shunned
by
his
children
the
only
beings
whom
he
had
endeavoured
as
far
as
his
temper
would
permit
to
attach
to
him
they
were
dismissed
to
school
at
a
very
early
age
and
were
soon
treated
by
their
father
in
the
same
harsh
manner
as
all
those
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
under
his
baneful
protection
they
returned
home
at
holiday
time
with
regret
and
the
recommencement
of
their
scholastic
duties
was
a
source
of
delight
the
mother
died
and
all
at
home
was
desolate
the
violence
of
their
father
seemed
to
increase
from
indulgence
and
the
youths
who
were
verging
into
manhood
proved
that
no
small
portion
of
the
parent
fiery
disposition
had
been
transmitted
to
them
and
showed
a
spirit
of
resistance
which
ended
in
their
ruin
william
the
eldest
of
the
boys
was
as
it
were
by
birthright
the
first
to
fall
a
victim
to
his
father
temper
struck
senseless
and
bleeding
to
the
ground
for
some
trifling
indiscretion
as
he
lay
confined
to
his
bed
for
many
subsequent
days
he
formed
the
resolution
of
seeking
his
own
fortune
rather
than
submit
to
hourly
degradation
at
the
period
at
which
this
occurred
many
years
previously
to
the
one
of
which
we
are
now
writing
the
east
india
company
had
but
a
short
time
received
its
charter
and
its
directors
were
not
the
proud
rulers
which
they
have
since
become
it
never
was
calculated
that
a
company
originally
consisting
of
a
few
enterprising
merchants
could
ever
have
established
themselves
even
by
the
most
successful
of
mischievous
arts
the
controllers
of
an
immense
empire
independent
of
and
anomalous
to
the
constitution
of
england
or
that
privileges
granted
to
stimulate
the
enterprise
of
individuals
would
have
been
the
ground
of
a
monopoly
which
like
an
enormous
incubus
should
oppress
the
nation
from
the
throne
to
the
cottage
they
gladly
accepted
the
offers
of
all
adventurers
and
at
that
period
there
was
as
much
eagerness
on
their
part
to
secure
the
services
of
individuals
as
there
is
now
on
the
part
of
applicants
to
be
enrolled
on
the
books
of
the
company
william
without
acquainting
his
father
entered
into
an
engagement
with
the
company
signed
it
and
was
shipped
off
with
many
others
who
less
fortunate
had
been
nefariously
kidnapped
for
the
same
destination
he
arrived
in
india
rose
to
the
rank
of
captain
and
fell
in
one
of
the
actions
that
were
fought
at
this
time
the
letter
which
william
left
on
the
table
directed
to
his
father
informing
him
of
the
step
he
had
been
induced
to
take
was
torn
to
atoms
and
stamped
upon
with
rage
and
the
bitter
malediction
of
the
parent
was
launched
with
dreadful
vehemence
upon
the
truant
son
in
the
presence
of
the
one
who
remained
and
yet
there
was
one
man
before
whom
this
haughty
and
vindictive
spirit
quailed
and
who
had
the
power
to
soften
although
not
wholly
to
curb
his
impetuosity
one
who
dared
to
tell
him
the
truth
expose
to
him
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
his
conduct
and
meet
the
angry
flash
of
his
eye
with
composure
one
whose
character
and
office
secured
him
from
insult
and
who
was
neither
to
be
frightened
nor
diverted
from
his
purpose
of
doing
good
it
was
the
vicar
of
the
parish
who
much
as
he
disliked
the
admiral
for
captain
de
courcy
had
latterly
obtained
the
rank
by
seniority
on
the
list
continued
his
visits
to
the
hall
that
he
might
appeal
for
the
unfortunate
the
admiral
would
willingly
have
shaken
him
off
but
his
attempts
were
in
vain
the
vicar
was
firm
at
his
post
and
often
successfully
pleaded
the
cause
of
his
parishioners
who
were
most
of
them
tenants
of
the
admiral
he
was
unassisted
in
his
parochial
duties
by
the
curate
a
worthy
but
infirm
and
elderly
man
fast
sinking
into
his
grave
and
whom
out
of
christian
charity
he
would
not
remove
from
his
situation
as
it
would
have
deprived
him
of
the
means
of
support
edward
the
younger
brother
naturally
sought
that
happiness
abroad
which
was
denied
him
at
home
the
house
of
the
curate
was
one
of
his
most
favourite
resorts
for
the
old
man
had
a
beautiful
and
only
daughter
poor
ellen
whose
fate
we
have
just
recorded
it
is
sufficient
for
the
present
narrative
to
state
that
these
two
young
people
loved
and
plighted
their
troth
that
for
two
years
they
met
with
joy
and
parted
with
regret
until
the
approaching
dissolution
of
the
old
curate
opened
their
eyes
to
the
dangerous
position
in
which
they
were
placed
he
died
and
edward
who
beheld
her
whom
he
loved
thrown
unprotected
and
penniless
on
the
world
mustered
up
the
courage
of
desperation
to
state
to
his
father
the
wishes
of
his
heart
a
peremptory
order
to
leave
the
house
or
abandon
ellen
was
the
immediate
result
and
the
indignant
young
man
quitted
the
roof
and
persuaded
the
unhappy
and
fond
girl
to
unite
herself
to
him
by
indissoluble
ties
in
a
neighbouring
parish
before
the
vicar
had
possession
of
the
facts
or
the
opportunity
to
dissuade
him
from
so
imprudent
a
step
he
immediately
proceeded
to
the
hall
with
a
faint
hope
of
appeasing
the
irritated
parent
but
his
endeavours
were
fruitless
and
the
admiral
poured
forth
his
anathema
against
his
only
child
edward
now
took
his
wife
to
a
village
some
miles
distant
where
by
their
mutual
exertions
they
contrived
for
some
time
to
live
upon
their
earnings
but
the
birth
of
their
first
child
the
hero
of
this
tale
and
the
expenses
attending
her
sickness
forced
him
at
last
when
all
appeals
to
his
father
proved
in
vain
to
accept
the
high
bounty
that
was
offered
for
men
to
enter
into
his
majesty
service
which
he
did

the
assumed
name
of

in
a
lofty
room
the
wainscoting
of
which
was
of
dark
oak
with
a
high
mantelpiece
elaborately
carved
in
the
same
wood
with
groups
of
dead
game
and
flowers
and
a
few
choice
pictures
let
into
the
panels
upon
an
that
once
had
been
splendid
with
morocco
and
gold
sat
a
man
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
but
his
hair
was
grey
and
his
face
was
indented
with
deep
lines
and
furrows
he
was
listening
with
impatience
to
the
expostulations
of
one
who
stood
before
him
and
shifted
his
position
from
time
to
time
when
more
than
usually
annoyed
with
the
subject
it
was
admiral
de
courcy
and
the
vicar
of
the
parish
who
was
persuading
him
to
be
merciful
the
subject
of
this
discourse
was
however
dismissed
by
the
entrance
of
a
servant
who
presented
to
the
admiral
upon
a
large
and
massive
salver
a
letter
brought
as
he
stated
by
a
seafaring
man
the
admiral
lifted
up
his
glasses
to
examine
the
superscription
from
my
worthless
vagabond
of
a
son
exclaimed
he
and
he
jerked
the
letter
into
the
fire
without
breaking
the
seal
surely
sir
rejoined
the
vicar
it
would
be
but
justice
to
hear
what
he
has
to
offer
in
extenuation
of
a
fault
too
severely
punished
already
he
is
your
only
son
sir
and
why
not
forgive
one
rash
act
recollect
sir
that
he
is
the
heir
to
this
property
which
being
entailed
must
of
necessity
devolve
upon
him
curses
on
the
bare
thought
answered
the
admiral
with
vehemence
i
hope
to
starve
him
first
may
the
almighty
show
more
mercy
to
you
sir
when
you
are
called
to
your
account
than
you
have
shown
to
an
imprudent
and
hasty
child
we
are
told
that
we
are
to
forgive
if
we
hope
to
be
forgiven
admiral
de
courcy
it
is
my
duty
to
ask
you
do
you
expect
and
if
so
upon
what
grounds
to
be
forgiven
yourself
the
admiral
looked
towards
the
window
and
made
no
reply
the
letter
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
grate
was
not
yet
consumed
it
had
lit
upon
a
mass
of
not
yet
ignited
coal
and
lay
there
blackening
in
the
smoke
the
vicar
perceived
it
and
walking
to
the
fireplace
recovered
the
letter
from
its
perilous
situation
if
you
do
not
choose
to
read
it
yourself
admiral
if
you
refuse
to
listen
to
the
solicitations
of
an
only
child
have
you
any
objection
that
i
should
open
the
letter
and
be
acquainted
with
the
present
condition
of
a
young
man
who
as
you
know
was
always
dear
to
me
none
none
replied
the
admiral
sarcastically
you
may
read
it
and
keep
it
too
if
you
please
the
vicar
without
any
answer
to
this
remark
opened
the
letter
which
as
the
reader
may
probably
imagine
was
the
one
written
by
edward
peters
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
merciful
heaven
exclaimed
the
man
of
religion
as
he
sat
down
to
recover
from
the
shock
he
had
unfortunate
boy
the
admiral
turned
round
astonished
at
the
demeanour
of
the
clergyman
and
it
would
appear
as
if
his
conscience
had
pressed
him
hard
and
that
he
was
fearful
that
his
cruel
wish
expressed
but
a
few
minutes
before
had
been
realised
he
turned
pale
but
asked
no
questions
after
a
short
time
the
vicar
rose
and
with
a
countenance
of
more
indignation
than
the
admiral
or
others
had
ever
seen
thus
addressed
him
the
time
may
come
sir
nay
i
prophesy
that
it
come
when
the
contents
of
this
letter
will
cause
you
bitterly
to
repent
your
cruel
and
unnatural
conduct
to
your
son
the
letter
itself
sir
i
can
not
intrust
you
with
in
justice
to
others
it
must
not
be
put
into
your
hands
and
after
your
attempt
to
commit
it
to
the
flames
and
your
observation
that
i
might
read
and
it
i
feel
justified
in
retaining
it
a
copy
of
it
if
you
please
i
will
send
you
sir
i
want
neither
copy
nor
original
nor
shall
i
read
them
if
you
send
them
good
sir
answered
the
admiral
pale
with
anger
fare
you
well
then
sir
may
god
turn
your
heart
so
saying
the
vicar
left
the
room
with
a
determination
not
to
enter
it
again
his
first
inquiry
was
for
the
person
who
had
brought
the
letter
and
he
was
informed
that
he
still
waited
in
the
hall
it
was
old
adams
who
had
obtained
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
days
that
he
might
fulfil
the
last
request
of
peters
the
clergyman
here
received
a
second
shock
from
the
news
of
the
death
of
poor
ellen
and
listened
with
the
deepest
interest
to
adams
straightforward
account
of
the
whole
catastrophe
the
first
plan
that
occurred
to
the
vicar
was
to
send
for
the
child
and
take
charge
of
him
himself
but
this
was
negatived
not
only
by
letter
but
also
by
old
adams
who
stated
his
determination
to
retain
the
child
until
claimed
by
legal
authority
after
mature
deliberation
he
considered
that
the
child
would
be
as
much
under
an
allseeing
eye
on
the
water
as
on
the
land
and
that
at
so
early
an
age
he
was
probably
as
well
under
the
charge
of
a
trustworthy
old
man
like
adams
as
he
would
be
elsewhere
he
therefore
requested
adams
to
let
him
have
constant
accounts
of
the
boy
welfare
and
to
apply
to
him
for
any
funds
that
he
might
require
for
his
maintenance
and
wishing
the
old
man
farewell
he
set
off
for
the
vicarage
communing
with
himself
as
to
the
propriety
of
keeping
the
circumstance
of
the
boy
birth
a
secret
or
divulging
it
to
his
grandfather
in
the
hopes
of
eventually
inducing
him
to
acknowledge
and
to
protect
him
chapter

take

of
your
tayle
old

many
and
various
were
the
questions
that
were
put
by
our
little
hero
to
adams
and
others
relative
to
the
fate
of
his
parents
that
they
were
both
dead
was
all
the
information
that
he
could
obtain
for
to
the
honour
of
human
nature
there
was
not
one
man
in
a
ship
company
composed
of
several
hundred
who
had
the
cruelty
to
tell
the
child
that
his
father
had
been
hanged
it
may
at
first
appear
strange
to
the
reader
that
the
child
himself
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
from
what
he
had
witnessed
on
the
morning
of
execution
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
he
had
never
seen
an
execution
before
and
had
therefore
nothing
from
which
to
draw
such
an
inference
all
he
knew
was
that
his
father
was
on
the
with
a
on
and
that
he
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
sleep
the
death
of
his
mother
whose
body
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
was
quite
as
unintelligible
and
the
mystery
which
enveloped
the
whole
transaction
added
no
little
to
the
bereavement
of
the
child
who
as
i
have
before
stated
from
his
natural
talent
and
peculiar
education
was
far
more
reflective
and
advanced
than
children
usually
are
adams
returned
to
his
little
charge
with
pleasure
he
had
now
a
right
to
adopt
the
child
and
consider
him
as
his
own
in
the
ship
the
boy
was
such
an
object
of
general
sympathy
that
not
only
many
of
the
men
but
some
of
the
officers
would
gladly
have
taken
him
and
have
brought
him
up
the
name
of
his
father
was
by
general
consent
never
mentioned
especially
as
adams
informed
the
officers
and
men
that
peters
had
been
a
adopted
by
the
child
father
and
that
although
the
clergyman
had
stated
this
he
had
not
intrusted
him
with
the
real
name
that
the
child
was
entitled
to
bear
as
therefore
our
little
hero
was
not
only
without
parents
but
without
name
he
was
by
adams
by
the
cognomen
of
the
king
own
and
by
that
title
or
his
christian
name
willy
was
ever
afterwards
addressed
both
by
officers
and
men
there
is
an
elasticity
supplied
to
the
human
mind
by
unerring
wisdom
that
enables
us
however
broken
down
by
the
pressure
of
misfortune
to
recover
our
cheerfulness
after
a
while
and
resign
ourselves
to
the
decrees
of
heaven
it
consoles
the
widow
it
supports
the
bereaved
lover
who
had
long
dwelt
upon
anticipated
bliss
it
almost
reconciles
to
her
lot
the
fond
and
forsaken
girl
whose
heart
is
breaking
unusually
oppressed
as
willy
was
with
the
loss
of
those
to
whom
he
had
so
fondly
clung
from
his
birth
in
a
few
months
he
recovered
his
wonted
spirits
and
his
cheeks
again
played
with
dimples
as
his
flashing
eye
beamed
from
under
his
long
eyelashes
he
attached
himself
to
the
old
and
seldom
quitted
him
he
slept
in
his
hammock
he
stood
by
his
side
when
he
was
on
deck
at
his
duty
steering
the
ship
and
he
listened
to
the
stories
of
the
good
old
man
who
soon
taught
him
to
read
and
write
for
three
years
thus
passed
his
life
at
the
end
of
which
period
he
had
arrived
at
the
age
of
nine
years
after
a
long
monotony
of
blockade
service
the
ship
was
ordered
to
hoist
the
flag
of
a
commodore
who
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
an
expedition
against
the
western
coast
of
france
to
create
a
diversion
in
favour
of
the
vendean
chiefs
captain
a
whether
it
was
that
he
did
not
like
to
receive
a
superior
officer
on
board
of
his
ship
or
that
he
did
not
admire
the
service
upon
which
she
was
to
be
employed
obtained
permission
to
leave
his
ship
for
a
few
months
for
the
restoration
of
his
health
to
the
great
joy
of
the
officers
and
crew
and
an
acting
captain
of
merit
was
appointed
in
his
stead
the
squadron
of
and
transports
was
collected
the
flag
hoisted
and
the
expedition
sailed
with
orders
which
as
usual
were
as
well
known
to
the
enemy
and
everybody
in
england
as
they
were
to
those
by
whom
they
were
given
it
is
the
characteristic
of
our
nation
that
we
scorn
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
or
reap
any
benefit
by
keeping
our
intentions
a
secret
we
imitate
the
conduct
of
that
english
tar
who
having
entered
a
fort
and
meeting
a
spanish
officer
without
his
sword
being
providentially
supplied
with
two
himself
immediately
offered
him
one
that
they
might
engage
on
fair
terms
the
idea
is
generous
but
not
wise
but
i
rather
imagine
that
this
want
of
secrecy
arises
from
all
matters
of
importance
being
arranged
by
cabinet
councils
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
there
may
be
wisdom
but
there
certainly
is
not
secrecy
twenty
men
have
probably
twenty
wives
and
it
is
therefore
twenty
to
one
but
the
secret
transpires
through
that
channel
further
twenty
men
have
twenty
tongues
and
much
as
we
complain
of
women
not
keeping
secrets
i
suspect
that
men
deserve
the
odium
of
the
charge
quite
as
much
if
not
more
than
women
do
on
the
whole
it
is
forty
to
one
against
secrecy
which
it
must
be
acknowledged
are
long
odds
on
the
arrival
of
the
squadron
at
the
point
of
attack
a
few
more
days
were
thrown
away
probably
upon
the
same
generous
principle
of
allowing
the
enemy
sufficient
time
for
preparation
troops
had
been
embarked
with
the
intention
of
landing
them
to
make
a
simultaneous
attack
with
the
shipping
combined
expeditions
are
invariably
attended
with
delay
if
not
with
disagreement
an
officer
commanding
troops
who
if
once
landed
would
be
as
decided
in
his
movements
as
lord
wellington
himself
does
not
display
the
same
decision
when
out
of
his
own
element
from
his
peculiar
situation
on
board
his
officers
and
men
distributed
in
different
ships
the
apparent
difficulties
of
debarkation
easily
remedied
and
despised
by
sailors
but
magnified
by
landsmen
from
the
great
responsibility
naturally
felt
in
a
situation
where
he
must
trust
to
the
resources
of
others
and
where
his
own
however
great
can
not
be
called
into
action
he
will
not
decide
without
much
demur
upon
the
steps
to
be
taken
although
it
generally
happens
that
the
advice
originally
offered
by
the
naval
commandant
has
been
acceded
to
unless
the
military
force
required
is
very
large
marines
should
invariably
be
employed
and
placed
under
the
direction
of
the
naval
commander
after
three
or
four
days
of
and
the
enemy
had
completed
his
last
battery
and
as
there
was
then
no
rational
excuse
left
for
longer
delay
the
debarkation
took
place
without
any
serious
loss
on
our
side
except
that
of
one
launch
full
of
the
regiment
which
was
cut
in
halves
by
the
enemy
shot
the
soldiers
as
they
sank
in
the
water
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
sergeant
and
held
up
their
that
they
might
not
be
wetted
two
seconds
sooner
than
necessary
held
fast
their
muskets
and
without
stirring
from
the
gunnels
of
the
boat
round
which
they
had
been
stationed
went
down
in
as
good
order
as
could
be
expected
each
man
at
his
post
with
his
bayonet
fixed
the
sailors
not
being
either
so
heavily
caparisoned
or
so
well
drilled
were
guilty
of
a
qui
and
were
picked
up
by
other
boats
the
officer
of
the
regiment
stuck
to
his
men
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
he
marched
the
whole
of
his
brave
detachment
to
heaven
as
he
often
had
before
to
church
but
we
must
leave
the
troops
to
form
on
the
beach
as
well
as
they
can
and
the
enemy
shot
will
permit
and
retire
on
board
the
commodore
arrangement
had
been
punctually
complied
with
the
ships
that
were
directed
to
cover
the
landing
of
the
troops
knocked
down
many
of
the
enemy
and
not
a
great
many
more
of
our
own
men
the
stations
of
the
other
ships
were
taken
with
a
precision
deserving
of
the
highest
encomiums
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
had
not
the
enemy
had
the
advantage
of
stone
walls
they
must
have
had
the
worst
of
it
and
would
have
been
well
beaten
the
commodore
himself
of
course
took
the
post
of
honour
anchored
with
springs
on
his
cables
he
alternately
engaged
a
heavy
battery
on
his
starboard
bows
a
much
heavier
backed
by
a
citadel
throwing
shells
on
his
beam
and
a
masked
battery
on
his
quarter
which
he
had
not
reckoned
upon
the
latter
was
rather
annoying
and
the
citadel
threw
shells
with
most
disagreeable
precision
he
had
almost
as
much
to
do
as
lord
exmouth
at
algiers
although
the
result
was
not
so
fortunate
a
ship
engaging
at
anchor
with
very
little
wind
and
that
wind
lulled
by
the
percussion
of
the
air
from
the
report
of
the
guns
as
it
always
is
has
the
disadvantage
of
not
being
able
to
disengage
herself
of
the
smoke
which
rapidly
accumulates
and
stagnates
as
it
were
between
the
decks
under
these
circumstances
you
repeatedly
hear
the
order
passed
upon
the
main
and
lower
deck
of
a
ship
to
point
the
guns
two
points
abaft
the
beam
and
so
on
in
fact
they
are
as
much
in
the
dark
as
to
the
external
objects
as
if
they
were
blindfolded
and
the
only
comfort
to
be
derived
from
this
serious
inconvenience
is
that
every
man
is
so
isolated
from
his
neighbour
that
he
is
not
put
in
mind
of
his
own
danger
by
witnessing
the
death
of
those
around
him
for
they
may
fall
three
or
four
feet
from
him
without
his
perceiving
it
so
they
continued
to
fire
as
directed
until
they
are
either
sent
down
to
the
themselves
or
have
a
momentary
respite
from
their
exertions
when
choked
with
smoke
and
gunpowder
they
go
aft
to
the
to
remove
their
parching
thirst
so
much
for
the
lower
and
main
deck
we
will
now
ascend
to
the
where
we
shall
find
old
adams
at
the
conn
and
little
willy
standing
behind
him
the
smoke
is
not
so
thick
here
but
that
you
may
perceive
the
commodore
on
the
poop
walking
a
step
or
two
to
and
then
turning
short
round
to
port
he
is
looking
anxiously
through
his
glass
at
the
position
of
the
troops
who
are
ashore
to
storm
the
batteries
hoping
to
see
a
diversion
in
our
favour
made
by
them
as
the
affair
becomes
serious
by
a
singular
coincidence
the
commandant
of
the
troops
on
shore
is
with
his
telescope
looking
anxiously
at
the
shipping
hoping
the
same
thing
from
the
exertions
of
the
navy
the
captain
of
marines
lies
dead
upon
the
poop
both
his
legs
have
been
shot
off
by
a
spent
shot
he
is
left
there
as
no
surgeon
can
help
him
and
there
are
two
signalmen
lying
dead
alongside
him
on
the
of
the
stands
the
acting
captain
of
the
ship
erect
and
proud
in
bearing
with
an
eye
of
defiance
and
scorn
as
he
turns
towards
the
enemy
his
advice
was
disregarded
but
he
does
his
duty
proudly
and
cheerfully
he
is
as
cool
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
were
watching
the
flying
fish
as
they
rise
from
the
bows
of
the
ship
when
running
down
the
tropics
instead
of
the
enemy
shot
as
they
splash
in
the
water
alongside
or
tear
open
the
timbers
of
the
vessel
and
the
bodies
of
his
crew
the
men
still
ply
their
guns
but
they
are
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
the
bloody
deck
proves
that
many
have
been
dismissed
from
their
duty
the
is
missing
you
will
find
him
in
the
they
have
just
finished
taking
up
the
arteries
of
his
right
arm
which
has
been
amputated
and
the
scotch
surgeon
assistant
who
for
many
months
bewailed
the
want
of
practice
and
who
for
having
openly
expressed
his
wishes
on
that
subject
had
received
a
sound
thrashing
from
the
exasperated
midshipmen
is
now
complimenting
the
fainting
man
upon
the
excellent
stump
that
they
have
made
for
him
while
fifty
others
dying
or
wounded
with
as
much
variety
as
homer
heroes
whose
blood
trickling
from
them
in
several
rivulets
pours
into
one
general
lake
at
the
lowest
level
of
the
deck
are
anxiously
waiting
their
turn
and
distract
the
purser
steward
by
their
loud
calls
in
every
direction
at
the
same
time
for
the
of
water
with
which
he
is
relieving
their
agonising
thirst
a
large
shark
is
under
the
counter
he
is
so
gorged
with
human
flesh
that
he
can
scarcely
move
his
tail
in
the
tinged
water
and
he
now
hears
the
sullen
plunges
of
the
bodies
as
they
are
launched
through
the
port
with
perfect
indifference
oh
what
a
glorious
thing
a
battle
but
to
return
to
our
particular
narrative
as
we
mentioned
before
the
citadel
threw
shells
with
remarkable
precision
and
every
man
who
had
been
killed
on
the
of
the
commodore
ship
towards
which
the
attention
of
the
enemy
was
particularly
directed
had
been
laid
low
by
these
horrible
engines
of
modern
warfare
the
action
still
continued
although
the
fire
on
both
sides
had
evidently
slackened
and
the
commodore
glass
had
at
several
intervals
been
fruitlessly
directed
towards
the
troops
on
shore
when
accident
brought
about
a
change
in
favour
of
our
countrymen
through
some
unknown
cause
the
magazine
of
the
enemy
largest
battery
exploded
and
buried
the
fabric
with
its
tenants
in
one
mass
of
ruin
the
enemy
were
with
their
misfortune
our
troops
and
sailors
inspired
with
fresh
courage
and
the
fire
was
recommenced
with
three
cheers
and
redoubled
vigour
the
troops
pushed
on
and
succeeded
in
taking
possession
of
the
masked
battery
which
had
so
long
and
so
effectually
raked
the
commodore
a
few
minutes
after
this
had
occurred
the
citadel
recommenced
its
fire
and
a
shell
descending
with
that
terrific
hissing
peculiar
to
itself
alone
struck
the
on
the
quarter
deck
and
rolling
aft
exploded
its
fragments
scattered
death
around
and
one
piece
took
the
hat
off
the
head
of
little
willy
who
was
standing
before
adams
and
then
buried
itself
in
the
old
man
side
he
staggered
forward
and
fell
on
the
coils
of
rope
near
the
and
when
the
men
came
to
assist
him
below
the
pain
of
moving
was
so
intense
that
he
requested
to
be
left
where
he
was
that
he
might
quietly
breathe
his
last
willy
sat
down
beside
his
old
friend
holding
his
a
little
water
boy
quick
quick
it
was
soon
procured
by
the
active
and
affectionate
child
who
indifferent
to
the
scene
around
him
thought
only
of
administering
to
the
wants
and
alleviating
the
misfortune
of
his
dearest
friend
adams
after
he
had
drunk
turned
his
head
round
apparently
revived
and
said
in
a
low
and
catching
voice
as
if
his
powers
were
fast
escaping
willy
your
father
name
was
not
peters
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
but
there
is
a
person
who
does
and
who
takes
an
interest
in
your
welfare
he
lives
in
at
this
moment
another
shell
bounded
through
the
rigging
and
fell
within
a
few
feet
of
the
spot
where
willy
and
old
adams
were
speaking
willy
who
was
seated
on
a
coil
of
rope
supporting
the
head
of
his
benefactor
no
sooner
perceived
the
shell
as
it
rolled
towards
the
side
with
its
fuse
pouring
out
a
volume
of
smoke
than
recollecting
the
effects
of
the
former
explosion
rather
than
the
danger
of
the
attempt
he
ran
towards
it
and
not
being
able
to
lift
it
sank
down
on
his
knees
and
with
astonishing
agility
succeeded
in
rolling
it
overboard
out
of
the
larboard
to
which
it
was
near
the
shell
plunged
into
the
water
and
before
it
had
descended
many
feet
exploded
with
a
concussion
that
was
communicated
to
the
ship
fore
and
aft
our
hero
then
resumed
his
station
by
the
side
of
adams
who
had
witnessed
what
had
taken
place
you
have
begun
well
my
boy
said
the
old
man
faintly
a
man
in
the
ship
would
have
done
it
kiss
me
boy
the
child
leaned
over
the
old
man
and
kissed
his
cheek
clammy
with
the
dews
of
death
adams
turned
a
little
on
one
side
uttered
a
low
groan
and
expired

detain
the
narrative
without
being
at
all
necessary
for

development
i
shall
not
dwell
upon
the
results
of
the
engagement
which
was
soon
after
decided
with
very
indifferent
success
on
our
side
the
soldiers
were
the
ships
hauled
out
of
reach
of
the
enemy
guns
and
a
council
of
war
summoned
on
which
it
was
agreed
that
no
more
was
to
be
done
the
despatches
were
sent
home
they
certainly
differed
a
little
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
the
sum
total
of
killed
and
wounded
was
excessively
gratifying
to
the
nation
as
it
proved
that
there
had
been
hard
fighting
john
bull
is
rather
annoying
in
this
respect
he
imagines
that
no
action
can
be
well
fought
unless
there
is
a
considerable
loss
having
no
other
method
of
judging
of
the
merits
of
an
action
he
appreciates
it
according
to
the
list
of
killed
and
wounded
a
merchant
he
computes
the
value
of
an
object
by
what
it
has
cost
him
and
imagines
that
what
is
easily
and
cheaply
obtained
can
not
be
of
much
value
the
knowledge
of
this
peculiar
mode
of
reasoning
on
his
part
has
very
often
induced
officers
to
put
down
very
trifling
such
as
a
would
despise
to
swell
up
the
sum
total
of
the
loss
to
the
aggregate
of
the
honest
man
expectations
to
proceed
as
usual
in
cases
of
defeat
a
small
degree
of
accusation
and
recrimination
took
place
the
army
thought
that
the
navy
might
have
beaten
down
stone
ramparts
ten
feet
thick
and
the
navy
wondered
why
the
army
had
not
walked
up
the
same
ramparts
which
were
thirty
feet
perpendicular
some
of
the
ships
accused
others
of
not
having
had
a
sufficient
number
of
men
killed
and
wounded
and
the
boats
crews
whenever
they
met
on
shore
fought
each
other
desperately
as
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
honour
of
the
country
that
more
blood
should
be
spilt
but
this
only
lasted
three
weeks
when
a
more
successful
attempt
made
them
all
shake
hands
and
wonder
what
they
had
been
squabbling
about
there
was
however
one
circumstance
which
occurred
during
the
action
that
had
not
been
forgotten
it
had
been
witnessed
by
the
acting
captain
of
the
ship
and
had
been
the
theme
of
much
comment
and
admiration
among
the
officers
and
men
this
was
the
daring
feat
of
our
little
hero
in
rolling
the
shell
over
the
side
captain
m
the
new
commander
as
soon
as
his
more
important
avocations
would
permit
made
inquiries
among
the
officers
being
himself
a
stranger
in
the
ship
relative
to
willy
his
short
but
melancholy
history
was
soon
told
and
the
disconsolate
boy
was
summoned
from
under
the
where
he
sat
by
the
body
of
adams
which
with
many
more
lay
sewed
up
in
his
hammock
and
covered
over
with
the
waiting
for
the
evening
to
receive
the
rites
of
christian
burial
before
being
committed
to
the
deep
knowing
that
adams
had
been
his
only
protector
a
feeling
of
compassion
for
the
bereaved
and
orphan
boy
and
admiration
of
his
early
tokens
of
bravery
induced
captain
m
who
never
formed
a
resolution
in
haste
or
abandoned
it
if
once
formed
to
take
the
boy
under
his
own
protection
and
to
place
him
as
an
officer
on
that
upon
which
he
had
so
distinguished
himself
willy
in
obedience
to
orders
received
stood
by
the
captain
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
what
is
your
name
my
boy
said
the
captain
passing
a
scrutinising
glance
over
his
upright
and
figure
willy
sir
and
what
your
other
name
king
own
sir
this
part
of
the
boy
history
was
now
explained
by
the
who
was
in
command
in
consequence
of
the
being
wounded
he
must
have
a
name
replied
the
captain
william
king
own
will
not
do
is
he
on
the
books
no
sir
he
is
not
shall
i
put
him
down
as
william
jones
or
william
smith
no
no
those
are
too
common
the
boy
has
neither
father
mother
nor
name
that
we
know
of
as
we
may
therefore
have
a
choice
of
the
latter
for
him
let
it
be
a
good
one
i
have
known
a
good
name
make
a
fortune
with
a
novel
reading
girl
there
is
a
romance
in
the
history
let
him
have
a
name
somewhat
romantic
also
ay
ay
sir
replied
the
lieutenant
here
marine
tell
my
boy
to
bring
up
one
of
the
volumes
of
the
novel
in
my
cabin
the
book
made
its
appearance
on
the
perhaps
sir
we
may
find
one
here
said
the
lieutenant
presenting
the
book
to
the
captain
the
captain
smiled
as
he
took
the
book
let
us
see
said
he
turning
over
the
leaves
that
too
puppyish
like
that
yes
that
will
do
it
not
too
fine
yet
aristocratic
and
pretty
desire
mr
hinchen
the
clerk
to
enter
him
on
the
books
as
mr
william
seymour
midshipman
and
now
youngster
i
will
pay
for
your
outfit
and
first
year
mess
after
which
i
hope
your
pay
and
will
be
sufficient
to
enable
you
to
support
yourself
be
that
as
it
may
as
long
as
you
do
credit
to
my
patronage
i
shall
not
forget
you
willy
with
his
straw
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
supererogatory
touch
of
his
curly
hair
with
the
other
made
a
scrape
with
his
left
leg
after
the
manner
and
custom
of
seafaring
people
in
short
he
made
the
best
bow
that
he
could
observing
the
receipt
that
had
been
given
him
by
his
departed
friend
adams
might
have
turned
up
his
nose
at
it
but
captain
m
was
perfectly
satisfied
for
if
not
an
elegant
it
certainly
was
a
grateful
bow
our
young
officer
was
not
sent
down
to
mess
in
the
berth
of
the
midshipmen
his
kind
and
considerate
captain
was
aware
that
a
lad
who
creeps
in
at
the
is
promoted
from
before
the
mast
was
not
likely
to
be
favourably
received
in
the
midshipmen
mess
especially
by
that
part
of
the
community
who
from
their
obscure
parentage
would
have
had
least
reason
to
complain
he
was
therefore
consigned
to
the
charge
of
the
gunner
sincere
as
were
the
congratulations
of
the
officers
and
men
willy
was
so
much
affected
with
the
loss
of
his
fond
guardian
that
he
received
them
with
apathy
and
listened
to
the
applause
bestowed
upon
his
courage
with
tears
that
flowed
from
the
remembrance
of
the
cause
which
had
stimulated
him
to
the
deed
at
the
close
of
the
day
he
saw
the
body
of
his
old
friend
committed
to
the
deep
with
quivering
lips
and
aching
brow
and
as
it
plunged
into
the
clear
wave
felt
as
if
he
was
left
alone
in
the
world
and
had
no
one
to
love
and
to
cling
to
we
do
not
give
children
credit
for
the
feelings
which
they
possess
because
they
have
not
at
their
early
age
acquired
the
power
of
language
to
express
them
correctly
treat
a
child
as
you
would
an
equal
and
in
a
few
months
you
will
find
that
the
reason
of
his
having
until
then
remained
childish
was
because
he
had
heretofore
been
treated
as
a
being
of
inferior
capacity
and
feelings
true
it
is
that
at
an
early
age
the
feelings
of
children
are
called
forth
by
what
we
consider
as
trifles
but
we
must
recollect
in
humility
that
our
own
pursuits
are
as
vain
as
trifling
and
as
selfish
we
are
but
children
of
a
larger
growth
the
squadron
continued
to
hover
on
the
french
coast
with
a
view
of
alarming
the
enemy
and
of
making
a
more
fortunate
attempt
if
opportunity
occurred
early
in
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
willy
had
been
promoted
to
the
a
large
convoy
of
small
coasting
vessels
were
discovered
rounding
a
low
point
not
three
miles
from
the
squadron
a
general
signal
to
chase
was
immediately
thrown
out
and
in
half
an
hour
the
english
were
in
the
midst
of
them
pouring
broadside
after
broadside
upon
the
devoted
vessels
whose
sails
were
lowered
in
every
direction
in
token
of
submission
the
english
reminded
you
of
so
many
hawks
pouncing
upon
a
flight
of
small
birds
and
the
vessels
with
their
lowered
sails
just
flapping
with
the
breeze
seemed
like
so
many
victims
of
their
rapacity
who
lay
fluttering
on
the
ground
disabled
or
paralysed
with
terror
many
escaped
into
shoal
water
others
ran
ashore
some
were
sunk
and
about
twenty
taken
possession
of
by
the
ships
of
the
squadron
they
proved
to
be
part
of
a
convoy
laden
with
wine
and
bound
to
the
garonne
one
of
the
being
a
larger
vessel
than
the
rest
and
laden
with
wine
of
a
better
quality
was
directed
by
the
commodore
to
be
sent
to
england
the
casks
of
wine
on
board
of
the
others
were
hoisted
into
the
different
ships
and
distributed
occasionally
to
the
crews
captain
m
thought
that
the
departure
of
the
prize
to
england
would
be
a
favourable
opportunity
to
send
our
hero
to
receive
his
outfit
as
he
could
not
well
appear
on
the
as
an
officer
without
his
uniform
he
therefore
directed
the
master
mate
to
whose
charge
the
prize
was
about
to
be
confided
to
take
william
with
him
and
wrote
to
his
friends
at
portsmouth
whither
the
vessel
was
directed
to
proceed
to
fit
him
out
with
the
requisite
articles
and
send
him
back
by
the
first
ship
that
was
directed
to
join
the
squadron
the
prize
was
victualled
the
officer
received
his
written
orders
was
put
on
board
with
our
hero
and
three
men
and
parted
company
with
the
squadron
the
who
was
directed
to
take
the
vessel
to
portsmouth
was
the
spurious
progeny
of
the
of
a
ship
and
a
young
woman
who
attended
the
which
supplied
the
ship
company
with
necessaries
and
luxuries
if
they
could
afford
to
pay
for
them
the
class
of
people
who
obtain
their
livelihood
by
these
means
and
who
are
entirely
dependent
upon
the
navy
for
their
subsistence
are
naturally
anxious
to
secure
the
of
the
commanding
officers
of
the
ships
and
usually
contrive
to
have
on
their
establishment
a
girl
who
although
very
reserved
to
the
junior
officers
of
the
ship
is
all
smiles
to
the
and
will
not
stand
upon
trifles
for
the
benefit
of
her
employer
beauty
for
men
gold
for
women
such
are
the
glittering
baits
employed
in
this
world
to
entice
either
sex
from
the
paths
of
duty
or
discretion
the
service
was
indebted
to
this
species
of
bribery
for
the
officer
in
question
the
interest
of
his
supposed
father
was
sufficient
to
put
him
on
the
and
the
profits
of
his
mother
who
having
duly
served
her
apprenticeship
had
arrived
to
the
dignity
of
bumboat
woman
herself
and
was
a
fat
comely
matron
of
about
forty
years
of
age
were
more
than
sufficient
to
support
him
in
his
inferior
rank
his
education
and
natural
abilities
were
not
however
of
that
class
to
procure
him
either
friends
or
advancement
and
he
remained
in
the
capacity
of
and
was
likely
long
to
continue
so
unless
some
such
event
as
a
general
action
should
include
him
in
a
promotion
which
would
be
regulated
by
seniority
he
was
a
vulgar
little
man
with
a
sharp
face
and
nose
the
latter
very
red
from
the
constant
potations
of
not
only
his
own
allowance
but
of
that
of
every
youngster
in
the
ship
whom
he
could
bully
or
cajole
his
greatest
pride
and
his
constant
study
was
slang
in
which
he
was
no
mean
proficient
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
a
colt
a
foot
and
a
half
of
rope
knotted
at
one
end
and
whipped
at
the
other
for
the
benefit
of
the
youngsters
to
whom
he
was
a
most
inordinate
tyrant
he
could
judge
a
day
work
which
he
sent
in
with
the
rest
of
the
midshipmen
and
which
proofs
of
theoretical
knowledge
of
their
profession
were
in
those
days
little
attended
to
but
he
was
very
ignorant
and
quite
unfit
to
take
charge
of
any
vessel
captain
m
who
as
we
before
stated
had
joined
the
ship
as
acting
captain
and
had
not
had
time
to
ascertain
the
merits
or
demerits
of
the
officers
had
given
the
prize
to
his
charge
because
he
was
the
senior
mate
of
the
ship
the
prize
had
scarcely
trimmed
her
sails
and
shaped
her
course
when
mr
bullock
the
called
our
hero
to
him
and
addressed
him
in
the
following
elegant
phraseology
now
you
rebellious
spawn
touch
your
hat
you
young
whelp
knocking
off
poor
willy
only
hat
which
flew
to
leeward
and
went
overboard
mind
what
i
say
for
i
mean
to
be
as
good
as
a
father
to
you
you
not
an
officer
yet
and
if
you
were
it
would
be
all
the
same
so
no
capers
no
airs
you
see
i
only
three
men
in
the
vessel
besides
myself
they
are
in
three
watches
so
your
duty
will
be
to
attend
to
me
in
the
cabin
you
mull
my
claret
i
always
drinks
a
noggin
every
to
keep
the
wind
out
and
if
it
a
ready
and
a
good
do
you
see
this
taking
the
colt
out
of
his
pocket
stop
you
better
feel
it
at
once
and
then
when
you
knows
what
the
taste
of
it
is
you
take
care
how
you
slack
in
stays
so
saying
he
administered
three
or
four
hearty
cuts
on
the
back
and
shoulders
of
our
hero
who
had
been
sufficiently
drilled
into
the
manners
and
customs
of
a
to
know
the
value
of
the
proverb
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
a
spigot
had
been
already
inserted
into
one
of
the
casks
of
claret
which
were
lashed
on
deck
and
as
the
small
vessel
was
very
uneasy
in
the
heavy
swell
of
the
bay
of
biscay
our
hero
had
sufficient
employment
in
watching
the
pot
of
claret
and
preventing
it
from
being
upset
by
the
motion
of
the
vessel
as
it
was
constantly
heating
on
the
stove
in
the
cabin
this
potation
was
regularly
presented
by
willy
every
as
directed
to
his
commanding
officer
who
if
it
was
too
sweet
or
not
sweet
enough
or
if
he
could
not
drink
the
whole
invariably
and
much
to
the
annoyance
of
our
hero
threw
the
remainder
into
his
face
telling
him
that
was
his
share
of
it
this
arrangement
continued
in
full
force
for
three
days
and
three
nights
for
willy
was
roused
up
five
or
six
times
every
night
to
administer
the
doses
of
mulled
claret
which
mr
bullock
had
prescribed
for
himself
who
seemed
thin
and
meagre
as
he
was
to
be
somewhat
like
a
bamboo
in
his
structure
hollow
from
top
to
bottom
as
if
to
enable
him
to
carry
the
quantity
of
fluid
that
he
poured
down
his
throat
during
the
hours
as
for
intoxicating
him
that
appeared
to
be
impossible
from
long
habit
he
seemed
to
be
like
a
stiff
ship
that
careened
to
her
bearings
and
would
sooner
part
company
with
her
masts
than
heel
any
further
on
the
fourth
day
a
strong
gale
sprang
up
from
the
and
the
sea
ran
very
high
the
never
intended
to
encounter
the
huge
waves
of
the
bay
of
biscay
but
to
crawl
along
the
coast
and
seek
protection
from
them
on
the
first
indication
of
their
fury
labouring
with
a
heavy
cargo
not
only
stowed
below
but
on
the
decks
was
not
sufficiently
buoyant
to
rise
on
the
summits
of
the
waves
which
made
a
clean
breach
over
her
and
the
men
became
exhausted
with
the
wet
and
the
inclemency
of
the
season
on
the
third
day
of
the
gale
and
seventh
since
they
had
parted
company
with
the
fleet
a
squall
brought
the
mainmast
by
the
board
the
foresail
was
lowered
to
when
a
heavy
sea
struck
the
vessel
and
pouring
a
torrent
over
her
decks
swept
overboard
the
three
men
who
were
forward
reefing
the
sail
mr
bullock
the
master
mate
was
at
the
helm
willy
as
usual
down
below
attending
the
mulled
claret
which
had
been
more
than
ever
in
request
since
the
bad
weather
had
come
on
the
mate
quitted
the
helm
and
ran
forward
to
throw
a
rope
to
the
seamen
who
were
struggling
in
the
water
with
the
wreck
to
leeward
he
threw
one
which
was
seized
by
two
of
them
the
other
had
sunk
and
as
soon
as
they
had
hold
of
it
and
it
became
from
their
holding
on
he
perceived
to
his
dismay
that
he
had
stood
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
coil
and
that
it
had
encircled
itself
several
times
round
his
body
so
that
the
men
were
hauling
him
overboard
let
go
let
go
or
overboard
was
a
useless
exclamation
to
drowning
men
they
held
on
and
the
mate
too
held
on
by
the
rigging
for
his
life
the
efforts
of
the
drowning
men
dragging
him
at
last
from
off
his
legs
and
keeping
his
body
in
a
horizontal
position
as
they
hauled
at
his
feet
and
he
clung
in
desperation
to
the
willy
willy
a
knife
quick
quick
roared
the
mate
in
his
agony
willy
who
hearing
his
name
called
and
followed
up
by
the
quick
quick
had
no
idea
that
anything
but
the
mulled
claret
could
demand
such
unusual
haste
stopped
a
few
seconds
to
throw
in
the
sugar
and
stir
it
round
before
he
answered
the
summons
he
then
started
up
the
hatchway
with
the
pot
in
his
hand
but
these
few
seconds
had
decided
the
fate
of
mr
bullock
and
as
willy
head
appeared
up
the
hatchway
so
did
that
of
mr
bullock
disappear
as
he
sank
into
a
grave
so
dissonant
to
his
habits
he
had
been
unable
to
resist
any
longer
the
united
force
of
the
drowning
men
and
willy
was
just
in
time
to
witness
his
submersion
and
find
himself
more
destitute
than
ever
holding
on
by
the
shroud
with
one
hand
with
the
pot
of
mulled
claret
in
the
other
willy
long
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
spot
where
his
tyrannical
shipmate
had
disappeared
from
his
sight
and
forgetting
his
persecution
felt
nothing
but
sorrow
for
his
loss
another
sea
which
poured
over
the
decks
of
the
unguided
vessel
roused
him
from
his
melancholy
reverie
and
he
let
go
the
pot
to
cling
with
both
hands
to
the
rigging
as
the
water
washed
over
his
knees
then
seizing
a
favourable
opportunity
he
succeeded
in
regaining
the
cabin
of
the
vessel
where
he
sat
down
and
wept
bitterly
bitterly
for
the
loss
of
the
master
mate
and
men
for
he
had
an
affectionate
and
kind
heart
bitterly
for
his
own
forlorn
and
destitute
situation
old
adams
had
not
forgotten
to
teach
him
to
say
his
prayers
and
willy
had
been
accustomed
to
read
the
bible
which
the
old
man
explained
to
the
best
of
his
ability
the
vessel
laboured
and
groaned
as
she
was
buffeted
by
the
waves
the
wind
howled
and
the
sea
struck
her
trembling
sides
and
poured
over
her
deck
in
the
midst
of
this
wild
discord
of
the
elements
the
small
voice
of
the
kneeling
child
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
threatened
soon
to
be
removed
from
it
was
not
unheard
or
unheeded
by
an
omniscient
and
omnipotent
god
who
has
said
that
not
a
sparrow
should
fall
to
the
ground
without
his
knowledge
and
has
pointed
out
of
how
much
more
value
are
we
than
many
sparrows
willy
ended
his
devotions
and
his
tears
and
feeling
wet
and
cold
recollected
that
what
would
warm
his
departed
friend
the
mate
would
probably
have
the
same
effect
upon
him
he
crawled
up
the
with
another
tin
pot
and
having
succeeded
in
obtaining
some
wine
from
the
cask
returned
to
the
cabin
having
warmed
it
over
the
fire
and
sugared
it
according
to
the
receipt
of
mr
bullock
he
drank
more
of
it
than
perhaps
in
any
other
situation
he
would
have
done
and
lying
down
in
the
standing
at
the
side
of
the
cabin
soon
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
chapter
nine
and
there
he
went
ashore
without
delay
having
no
nor
quarantine
to
ask
him
awkward
questions
on
the
way
about
the
time
and
place
where
he
had
been
he
left
his
ship
to
be
hove
down
next
day
don
juan
the
prize
vessel
at
the
time
when
she
carried
away
her
masts
had
gained
considerably
to
the
northward
of
ushant
although
the
mate
from
his
ignorance
of
his
profession
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
the
wind
which
now
blew
strongly
from
the
north
west
drove
the
shattered
bark
up
the
channel
at
the
same
time
gradually
nearing
her
to
the
french
coast
after
hours
driving
before
the
storm
during
which
willy
never
once
awoke
from
his
torpor
the
vessel
was
not
many
leagues
from
the
port
of
cherbourg
it
was
broad
daylight
when
our
hero
awoke
and
after
some
little
time
necessary
to
chase
away
the
vivid
effects
of
a
dream
in
which
he
fancied
himself
to
be
on
shore
walking
in
the
fields
with
his
dear
mother
he
recollected
where
he
was
and
how
he
was
situated
he
ascended
the
and
looked
around
him
the
wind
had
nearly
spent
its
fury
and
was
subsiding
fast
but
the
prospect
was
cheerless
a
dark
wintry
sky
and
rolling
sea
and
nothing
living
in
view
except
the
that
screamed
as
it
skimmed
over
the
white
tops
of
the
waves
the
mizen
of
the
vessel
was
still
hoisted
up
but
the
sheet
had
disengaged
itself
from
the
and
the
sail
had
been
rent
from
the
by
the
storm
part
of
it
was
blown
away
and
the
rest
jagged
and
tattered
at
its
extremities
from
constant
buffeting
flapped
mournfully
to
and
fro
with
the
heavy
rolling
of
the
vessel
willy
holding
only
the
scanned
the
horizon
in
every
point
of
the
compass
in
hopes
of
succour
but
for
a
long
while
in
vain
at
last
his
keen
eye
detected
a
small
vessel
under
a
single
sail
now
rising
on
the
tops
of
the
waves
now
disappearing
in
the
deep
trough
of
the
sea
she
was
and
running
down
towards
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
neared
to
within
a
mile
and
willy
perceived
with
delight
that
the
people
were
on
deck
and
occasionally
pointing
towards
him
he
ran
down
below
and
opening
the
chest
of
mr
bullock
which
was
not
locked
took
a
liberty
which
he
would
never
have
dared
to
contemplate
during
that
worthy
officer
lifetime
that
of
putting
forth
one
of
his
two
best
white
shirts
reserved
for
special
occasions
this
he
took
on
deck
made
it
fast
to
a
staff
and
hoisted
as
a
signal
of
distress
he
did
also
mechanically
lift
his
hand
to
his
head
with
the
intention
of
waving
his
hat
but
he
was
reminded
by
not
finding
it
there
that
it
had
been
the
first
votive
offering
which
had
been
made
to
appease
the
implacable
deities
presiding
over
the
winds
and
waves
the
vessel
closed
with
him
to
windward
and
after
some
demur
a
small
boat
capable
of
holding
three
persons
was
hoisted
over
the
gunnel
and
two
hands
jumping
into
her
rowed
under
the
stern
of
the
wreck
you
must
jump
my
lad
there
no
going
alongside
a
craft
without
any
sail
to
steady
her
in
such
a
sea
as
this
do
be
afraid
we
pick
you
up
willy
who
had
little
fear
in
his
composition
although
he
could
not
swim
leaped
from
the
taffrail
of
the
vessel
into
the
boiling
surge
and
immediately
that
he
rose
to
the
surface
was
rescued
by
the
men
who
seizing
him
by
the
waistband
of
the
trousers
hauled
him
into
the
boat
and
threw
him
down
in
the
bottom
under
the
thwarts
then
without
speaking
they
resumed
their
oars
and
pulled
to
the
other
vessel
on
board
of
which
they
succeeded
in
establishing
our
hero
and
themselves
although
the
boat
was
stove
in
the
attempt
and
cast
adrift
as
useless
willy
teeth
chattered
and
his
whole
frame
trembled
with
the
cold
as
he
went
aft
to
the
captain
of
the
sloop
who
was
sitting
on
deck
wrapped
up
in
a
rough
white
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
the
captain
was
a
young
man
apparently
not
more
than
years
old
his
face
was
oval
with
a
remarkably
pleasing
expression
his
eye
small
and
brilliant
and
notwithstanding
the
roughness
of
his
outward
attire
there
was
a
degree
of
precision
in
the
arrangement
of
his
hair
and
whiskers
which
proved
that
with
him
neatness
was
habitual
he
had
a
worsted
mitten
on
his
left
hand
the
right
which
held
his
pipe
was
bare
and
remarkably
white
and
small
perceiving
the
situation
of
the
boy
he
called
to
one
of
the
men
here
phillips
take
this
poor
devil
down
and
put
something
dry
on
him
and
give
him
a
glass
of
brandy
when
he
all
right
again
we
find
out
from
him
how
he
happened
to
be
adrift
all
by
himself
like
a
bear
in
a
there
go
along
with
phillips
boy
he
of
the
right
sort
said
one
of
the
men
who
had
brought
him
on
board
casting
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
our
hero
who
was
descending
the
companion
i
thought
so
when
i
see
him
have
his
wits
about
him
to
hoist
the
signal
he
made
no
more
of
jumping
overboard
than
a
newfoundland
dog
never
stopped
two
seconds
to
think
o
we
shall
soon
see
what
he
is
made
of
replied
the
captain
relighting
his
pipe
which
had
been
allowed
to
go
out
during
the
time
that
they
were
rescuing
willy
and
the
men
from
the
boat
when
she
returned
willy
was
soon
provided
with
more
comfortable
clothing
and
whether
it
was
or
was
not
from
a
whim
of
phillips
who
had
been
commissioned
to
rig
him
out
he
appeared
on
deck
the
very
picture
of
the
animal
which
he
had
been
compared
to
by
the
sailor
thick
woollen
stockings
which
were
longer
than
both
his
legs
and
thighs
a
pair
of
fisherman
boots
a
dark
guernsey
frock
that
reached
below
his
knees
and
a
rough
that
descended
to
his
heels
made
him
appear
much
broader
than
he
was
high
a
red
woollen
nightcap
completed
his
attire
which
although
anything
but
elegant
was
admirably
calculated
to
assist
the
brandy
in
restoring
the
circulation
here
he
is
captain
but
not
very
neat
said
phillips
shoving
willy
up
the
hatchway
for
he
was
so
encumbered
with
the
weight
of
his
new
apparel
that
he
never
could
have
ascended
without
assistance
i
have
stowed
away
some
spirits
in
his
hold
and
he
no
longer
beats
the
devil
tattoo
with
his
grinders
now
my
lad
said
the
captain
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
tell
me
what
your
name
what
you
are
and
how
you
came
to
be
adrift
in
that
barky
tell
me
the
truth
be
honest
always
be
honest
it
the
best
policy
now
it
rather
unfortunately
happened
for
willy
that
these
two
first
questions
were
rather
difficult
for
him
to
answer
he
told
his
story
with
considerable
hesitation
believed
his
name
was
seymour
believed
he
was
a
midshipman
he
was
listened
to
without
interruption
by
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
vessel
who
had
gathered
round
to
hear
him
spin
his
yarn
when
he
had
finished
the
captain
looking
willy
very
hard
in
the
face
thus
addressed
him
my
little
friend
excuse
me
but
i
have
some
slight
knowledge
of
the
world
and
i
therefore
wish
that
you
had
not
forgotten
the
little
advice
i
gave
you
as
a
caution
before
you
commenced
your
narrative
did
not
i
say
you
you
are
an
officer
your
name
to
be
seymour
i
tell
you
my
lad
in
return
that
i
do
believe
a
word
that
you
say
but
however
that
of
no
consequence
it
requires
reflection
to
tell
a
lie
and
i
have
no
objection
to
a
little
invention
or
a
little
caution
with
strangers
all
that
about
the
battle
was
very
clever
but
still
depend
upon
it
honesty
the
best
policy
when
we
are
better
acquainted
i
suppose
we
shall
have
the
truth
from
you
i
see
the
land
on
the
we
shall
be
into
cherbourg
in
an
hour
when
i
expect
we
shall
come
to
a
better
understanding
the
for
such
was
the
name
of
the
vessel
which
smelt
most
insufferably
of
gin
and
as
our
readers
may
probably
have
anticipated
was
a
smuggler
running
between
cherbourg
and
the
english
coast
soon
entered
the
port
and
having
been
boarded
by
the
officers
of
the
douane
who
made
a
very
proper
distinction
between
smuggling
from
and
to
their
own
territories
came
to
an
anchor
close
to
the
mole
as
soon
as
the
vessel
was
secured
the
captain
went
below
and
in
a
few
minutes
reappearing
dressed
in
much
better
taste
than
of
the
saunterers
in
went
on
shore
to
the
cabaret
where
he
usually
took
up
his
quarters
taking
with
him
our
hero
whose
strange
attire
so
peculiarly
contrasted
with
that
of
the
captain
was
a
source
of
great
amusement
to
the
sailors
and
other
people
who
were
assembled
on
the
quay
mon
capitaine
charme
de
vous
revoir
buvons
un
coup
said
the
proprietor
of
the
cabaret
presenting
a
bottle
of
prime
french
brandy
and
a
liquor
glass
to
the
captain
as
he
entered
voyage
pas
va
replied
the
captain
throwing
the
glass
of
liquor
down
his
throat
my
apartments
if
you
please
and
a
bed
for
this
lad
tell
mr
beaujou
the
slopseller
to
come
here
directly
with
some
clothes
for
him
is
captain
debriseau
here
he
is
sir
lost
all
his
last
cargo
obliged
to
throw
over
in
deep
water
never
mind
he
ran
the
two
before
he
can
afford
it
ah
but
captain
debriseau
is
in
a
very
bad
humour
nevertheless
he
called
me
an
old
cheat
this
morning
well
present
my
compliments
to
him
and
say
that
i
request
the
honour
of
his
company
if
he
is
not
otherwise
engaged
come
youngster
the
landlord
of
the
cabaret
ushered
the
captain
of
the
sloop
and
our
hero
with
many
profound
bows
into
a
low
dark
room
with
only
one
window
the
light
from
which
was
intercepted
by
a
high
wall
not
four
feet
distant
the
floor
was
paved
with
tiles
the
table
was
deal
not
very
clean
and
the
whitewashed
walls
were
hung
around
with
stiff
drawings
of
several
smuggling
vessels
whose
superior
sailing
and
consequent
good
fortune
had
rendered
them
celebrated
in
the
port
of
cherbourg
the
straw
had
been
lighted
under
some
logs
of
wood
on
the
hearth
which
as
yet
emitted
more
smoke
than
flame
a
few
chairs
an
old
battered
sofa
and
an
upright
press
completed
the
furniture
i
knew
your
beautiful
sloop
long
before
she
came
in
there
no
mistaking
her
and
i
ordered
the
apartment
to
be
prepared
un
joli
apartement
pas
so
retired
with
some
forbearance
but
with
great
judgment
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
was
not
expatiated
upon
by
the
obsequious
landlord
it
will
do
to
smoke
and
eat
in
monsieur
picardon
and
that
is
all
that
i
require
now
bring
pipes
and
tobacco
and
take
my
message
to
captain
debriseau
the
latter
gentlemen
and
the
pipes
were
ushered
in
at
the
same
moment
mcelvina
my
dear
fellow
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
have
had
better
luck
than
i
have
had
this
last
trip
curses
on
the
cutter
continued
captain
debriseau
who
was
a
native
of
guernsey
the
wind
favoured
her
three
points
after
we
were
about
or
i
should
have
doubled
him
ay
and
have
doubled
the
weight
of
the
leathern
bag
too
nom

continued
he
grinding
his
teeth
and
pulling
a
handful
of
hair
out
of
his
rough
head
which
could
have
spared
as
much
as
absalom
used
to
poll
ca

mon
sit
down
and
take
a
pipe
rejoined
our
captain
this
is
but
pettifogging
work
at
the
best
it
wo
pay
for
the
means
of
resistance
my
lugger
will
be
ready
in
may
and
then
see
what
a
revenue
cutter
is
made
of
i
was
at
ostend
last
christmas
and
saw
her
by
jove
she
a
beauty
she
was
planked
above
the
watermark
then
and
must
be
nearly
ready
for
launching
by
this
time
i
pass
through
the
race
but
once
more
then
adieu
to
dark
nights
and
gales
and
huzza
for
a
row
of
teeth
with
the
will
as
well
as
the
power
to
bite
sixteen
long
nines
my
boy
quick
returns
though
quick
returns
messmate
answered
debriseau
referring
to
the
cherbourg
system
of
smuggling
which
being
his
own
means
of
livelihood
he
did
not
like
to
hear
disparaged
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
no
objection
to
unite
a
little
information
with
amusement
i
shall
here
enter
into
a
few
remarks
relative
to
the
smuggling
carried
on
between
the
port
of
cherbourg
and
our
own
coast
premising
that
my
readers
have
my
entire
approbation
to
skip
over
a
page
or
two
if
they
are
not
anxious
to
know
anything
about
these
nefarious
transactions
the
port
of
cherbourg
from
its
central
situation
is
better
adapted
than
any
other
in
france
for
carrying
on
this
trade
with
the
southern
coast
of
england
the
nearest
port
to
it
and
at
which
therefore
the
smuggling
is
principally
carried
on
is
the
bill
of
portland
near
to
the
fashionable
of
weymouth
the
vessels
employed
in
this
contraband
trade
of
which
gin
is
the
staple
commodity
are
generally
small
luggers
or
sloops
from
forty
to
sixty
tons
burthen
in
fine
summer
weather
are
occasionally
employed
but
as
the
is
only
of
hours
duration
the
dark
nights
and
gales
are
what
are
chiefly
depended
upon
these
vessels
are
not
armed
with
an
intention
to
resist
if
they
are
perceived
by
the
cruisers
or
revenue
vessels
before
they
arrive
on
the
english
coast
and
are
pursued
they
are
obliged
if
not
able
to
escape
from
superior
sailing
to
throw
over
their
cargo
in
deep
water
and
it
is
lost
the
cargo
is
thrown
overboard
to
avoid
the
penalty
and
imprisonment
to
which
it
would
subject
the
crew
as
well
as
the
confiscation
of
the
vessel
and
cargo
if
they
reach
the
english
coast
and
are
chased
by
the
revenue
vessels
or
have
notice
by
signals
from
their
agents
on
shore
that
they
are
discovered
and
can
not
land
their
cargoes
they
take
the
exact
bearings
and
distances
of
several
points
of
land
and
with
heavy
stones
sink
their
tubs
of
spirits
which
are
always
strung
upon
a
hawser
like
a
row
of
beads
there
the
cargo
is
left
until
they
have
an
opportunity
of
going
off
in
boats
to
creep
for
it
which
is
by
dragging
large
hooks
at
the
bottom
until
they
catch
the
hawser
and
regain
possession
of
their
tubs
such
is
the
precision
with
which
their
marks
are
taken
and
their
dexterity
from
continual
practice
that
they
seldom
fail
to
recover
their
cargo
the
profits
of
this
contraband
trade
are
so
great
that
if
two
cargoes
are
lost
a
third
safely
landed
will
indemnify
the
owners
i
must
now
observe
much
to
the
discredit
of
the
parties
who
are
concerned
that
this
contraband
trade
is
not
carried
on
by
individuals
but
by
a
company
one
hundred
pounds
shares
are
taken
of
the
profits
of
which
are
divided
yearly
and
many
individuals
residing
on
the
coast
who
would
be
thought
incapable
of
lending
themselves
to
such
transactions
are
known
to
be
deeply
interested
the
smuggling
from
havre
and
ostend
etcetera
is
confined
to
the
coast
of
ireland
and
the
northern
shores
of
england
the
cargoes
are
assorted
and
of
great
value
and
as
the
voyage
and
risk
are
greater
they
are
generally
vessels
well
manned
and
armed
to
enable
them
to
offer
resistance
when
the
disparity
of
force
is
not
too
great
on
their
side
captain
mcelvina
had
taken
up
the
smuggling
trade
between
cherbourg
and
portland
to
keep
himself
employed
until
a
fine
lugger
of
sixteen
guns
the
command
of
which
had
been
promised
to
him
and
which
was
intended
to
run
between
havre
and
the
coast
of
ireland
should
be
ready
whereas
captain
debriseau
had
been
all
his
life
employed
in
the
cherbourg
trade
and
had
no
intention
of
quitting
it
but
what
have
you
got
there
mac
said
debriseau
pointing
with
his
pipe
to
our
hero
who
sat
on
the
leathern
sofa
rolled
up
in
his
uncouth
attire
is
it
a
bear
or
a
boy
a
boy
that
i
picked
up
from
a
wreck
i
am
thinking
what
i
shall
do
with
him
he
is
a
smart
bold
lad
by
jupiter
rejoined
debriseau
i
make
him
my
ganymede
till
he
grows
older
had
willy
been
as
learned
in
mythology
as
captain
debriseau
he
might
have
informed
him
that
he
had
served
in
that
capacity
in
his
last
situation
under
mr
bullock
but
although
the
names
as
appertaining
to
a
ship
were
not
unknown
to
him
yet
the
attributes
of
the
respective
parties
were
a
part
of
his
education
that
old
adams
had
omitted
he
will
be
fit
for
anything
rejoined
our
captain
if
he
will
only
be
honest
mcelvina
said
debriseau
you
always
have
these
words
in
your
mouth
honest
now
as
between
ourselves
i
do
not
think
that
either
you
or
i
are
leading
very
honest
lives
allow
me
to
ask
you
why
you
continually
harp
upon
honesty
when
we
are
alone
i
can
easily
understand
the
propriety
of
shamming
a
little
before
the
world
debriseau
had
any
other
man
said
half
as
much
i
would
have
started
my
grog
in
his
face
it
no
humbug
on
my
part
i
mean
it
sincerely
and
to
prove
it
i
will
now
give
you
a
short
sketch
of
my
life
and
after
you
have
heard
it
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
will
acknowledge
with
me
the
truth
of
the
old
adage
that
is
the
best
policy
but
captain
mcelvina
must
have
a
chapter
to
himself
chapter
ten
he
hath
as
fine
a
hand
at
picking
a
pocket
as
a
woman
and
is
as
as
a
juggler
if
an
unlucky
session
does
not
cut
the
rope
of
his
life
i
pronounce
he
will
be
a
great
man
in
history
it
is
an
old
proverb
that
half
of
the
world
do
not
know
the
other
half
live
add
to
it
nor
they
live
and
it
will
be
as
true
there
is
a
class
of
people
of
whose
existence
the
public
are
too
well
aware
but
of
whose
resorts
and
manners
and
customs
among
their
own
fraternity
they
are
quite
as
ignorant
now
as
they
were
one
hundred
years
back
like
the
chinese
and
the
castes
of
the
east
they
never
change
their
profession
but
bequeath
it
from
father
to
son
as
an
entailed
estate
from
which
they
are
to
derive
their
subsistence
the
class
to
which
i
refer
consists
of
those
members
of
the
community
at
large
who
gain
their
livelihood
by
inserting
their
hands
into
the
pockets
of
other
people
not
but
that
all
the
world
are
doing
the
same
thing
and
have
since
the
creation
but
then
it
is
only
as
the
class
that
i
refer
to
do
it
which
you
must
observe
makes
a
wide
difference
from
this
class
i
am
lineally
descended
and
at
an
early
age
was
duly
initiated
into
all
the
mysteries
of
my
profession
i
could
filch
a
handkerchief
as
soon
as
i
was
high
enough
to
reach
a
pocket
and
was
declared
to
be
a
most
promising
child
i
must
do
my
father
and
mother
the
justice
to
acknowledge
that
while
they
initiated
me
in
the
mysteries
of
my
future
profession
they
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
that
there
were
certain
disagreeable
penalties
attached
to
but
when
prepared
from
our
earliest
years
we
look
forward
to
our
fate
with
resignation
and
as
i
was
invariably
told
after
my
return
from
some
daring
feat
that
my
life
would
be
a
short
and
a
merry
one
i
was
not
dismayed
at
the
words
of
my
prophetic
mother
who
observed
my
boy
if
you
do
wish
to
bring
my
grey
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
promise
me
to
confine
yourself
to
picking
pockets
you
will
then
only
be
transported
but
if
you
try
your
hand
at
higher
work
you
be
hung
before
you
twenty
my
father
when
i
returned
with
a
full
assorted
cargo
and
emptied
my
pockets
into
his
hands
with
as
much
rapidity
as
i
had
transferred
the
contents
of
others
into
my
own
used
to
look
at
me
with
a
smile
of
pride
and
satisfaction
and
shaking
his
head
would
exclaim
certainly
be
hung
accustomed
therefore
from
my
infancy
to
consider
twenty
summers
instead
of
threescore
years
and
ten
as
the
allotted
space
of
my
existence
i
looked
forward
to
my
exit
from
this
world
by
the
new
drop
with
the
same
placidity
as
the
nobleman
awaits
the
time
appointed
for
the
entrance
of
his
body
into
the
vault
containing
the
dust
of
his
ancestors
at
the
age
of
eleven
years
i
considered
myself
a
man
dared
all
that
man
could
do
and
was
a
constant
but
unwilling
attendant
upon
the
police
office
where
my
youth
and
the
promises
of
my
mother
that
i
should
be
reformed
assisted
by
showers
of
tears
on
her
part
and
by
apparent
ingenuousness
on
mine
frequently
pleaded
in
my
favour
with
the
prosecutors
i
often
lamented
when
at
that
early
age
that
my
want
of
education
prevented
me
from
attempting
the
higher
walks
of
our
profession
but
this
object
of
my
ambition
was
gained
at
last
i
had
taken
a
from
a
worthy
quaker
and
unfortunately
was
perceived
by
a
man
at
a
shop
window
who
came
out
collared
and
delivered
me
into
the
hands
of
the
prim
gentleman
having
first
secured
his
property
he
then
walked
with
me
and
a
police
officer
to
my
innocent
face
and
my
tears
induced
the
old
gentleman
who
was
a
member
of
the
philanthropic
society
not
only
not
to
prefer
the
charge
against
me
but
to
send
me
to
the
institution
at
i
made
rapid
progress
under
their
tuition
and
after
three
years
close
application
on
my
part
and
continual
inculcation
on
the
part
of
my
instructors
of
the
distinction
between
and
i
was
considered
not
only
a
very
clever
boy
but
a
reformed
character
the
quaker
gentleman
who
had
placed
me
in
the
institution
and
who
was
delighted
with
the
successful
results
of
his
own
penetration
selected
me
as
his
servant
and
took
me
home
well
i
glad
you
were
so
soon
reformed
said
debriseau
where
the
devil
my
handkerchief
oh
i
not
got
it
answered
mcelvina
laughing
but
you
are
as
much
mistaken
now
as
the
quaker
was
at
that
time
a
wild
beast
may
be
tamed
and
will
remain
so
provided
he
be
not
permitted
again
to
taste
blood
then
all
his
ferocious
propensities
will
reappear
and
prove
that
his
education
has
been
thrown
away
so
it
was
with
me
at
first
i
felt
no
desire
to
return
to
my
old
employment
and
had
not
my
master
trusted
me
too
much
i
might
have
remained
honest
you
often
hear
masters
exclaiming
against
the
dishonesty
of
servants
i
know
it
to
be
a
fact
that
most
of
them
have
been
made
dishonest
by
the
carelessness
of
their
employers
in
having
allowed
temptations
to
lie
in
their
way
which
were
too
strong
to
be
resisted
my
master
used
to
send
me
up
to
his
bureau
for
small
sums
which
he
required
out
of
a
yellow
canvas
bag
full
of
gold
and
silver
i
am
convinced
that
he
frequently
used
to
give
me
the
key
when
in
company
with
his
friends
in
order
that
after
i
had
left
the
room
he
might
tell
my
history
and
prove
the
beneficial
effects
of
the
society
one
day
the
yellow
bag
and
i
both
disappeared
i
threw
off
the
modest
grey
coat
in
which
i
was
equipped
and
soon
procured
more
fashionable
attire
i
looked
in
the
glass
and
scarcely
knew
myself
i
had
therefore
no
fear
of
being
recognised
by
my
former
master
not
wishing
to
be
idle
i
hired
myself
out
as
tiger
and
valet
to
a
young
nobleman
who
was
spending
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
upon
an
allowance
of
seven
hundred
he
was
a
complete
and
i
must
gratefully
own
that
i
learnt
a
great
deal
from
him
independently
of
the
secret
of
tying
my
neckcloth
correctly
but
we
soon
parted
how
was
that
said
debriseau
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
why
he
had
several
diamond
rings
and
as
he
only
wore
two
or
three
at
a
time
i
sported
the
others
at
our
parties
a
malicious
fellow
who
was
envious
of
the
dash
i
cut
observed
in
my
hearing
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
real
stones
from
good
paste
i
took
the
hint
and
one
by
one
the
diamonds
vanished
and
paste
usurped
their
places
shortly
after
the
creditors
not
being
able
to
touch
my
master
money
or
his
person
seized
his
effects
and
the
diamond
rings
were
almost
the
only
articles
which
escaped
my
master
who
always
looked
out
for
a
rainy
day
had
collected
these
rings
as
a
sort
of
to
the
wind
when
required
by
ill
luck
he
took
them
to
the
same
jeweller
who
had
been
employed
by
me
to
substitute
the
paste
and
to
whom
i
had
sold
the
real
stones
he
came
home
in
a
great
rage
accused
me
of
dishonesty
and
sent
for
a
constable
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
consider
his
conduct
to
be
that
of
a
gentleman
and
wished
him
good
morning
i
had
indeed
intended
to
quit
him
as
he
was
and
only
waited
his
return
to
tell
him
so
i
had
moved
my
trunks
accordingly
before
he
was
out
of
bed
i
believe
a
few
of
his
suits
and
some
of
his
linen
were
put
in
with
mine
in
my
extreme
haste
but
then
he
owed
me
wages
when
i
wished
his
lordship
good
morning
i
certainly
imagined
that
i
had
little
more
to
learn
but
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
was
mistaken
i
knew
that
there
was
a
club
established
for
servants
out
of
place
and
had
been
a
subscriber
for
two
years
as
there
were
many
advantages
arising
from
it
independently
of
economy
i
was
now
a
member
by
right
which
as
long
as
i
was
in
place
i
was
not
to
this
club
i
repaired
and
i
soon
found
that
i
who
fancied
myself
perfect
was
but
a
in
the
profession
it
was
a
grand
school
certainly
and
well
organised
we
had
our
president
auditors
of
accounts
corresponding
members
and
our
secretary
our
seal
was
a
bunch
of
green
poplar
rods
with
is
no
as
a
motto
but
not
to
weary
you
with
a
life
of
adventures
which
would
fill
volumes
i
shall
merely
state
that
i
was
in
place
out
of
place
following
up
my
profession
in
every
way
with
great
credit
among
our
fraternity
until
one
day
i
found
myself
after
a
tedious
confinement
in
newgate
decorated
with
a
yellow
jacket
and
pair
of
fetters
on
board
of
a
vessel
of
three
hundred
tons
burthen
bound
to
new
south
wales
we
sailed
for
sydney
where
i
had
been
recommended
by
the
gentleman
in
a
large
wig
to
remain
seven
years
for
change
of
air
the
same
night
that
the
vessel
came
into
the
cove
having
more
liberty
than
the
rest
of
my
shipmates
from
my
good
behaviour
during
the
passage
i
evaded
the
sentry
and
slipping
down
by
the
cable
into
the
water
swam
to
a
ship
lying
near
which
i
had
been
informed
was
to
sail
on
the
ensuing
day
for
india
the
captain
being
very
short
of
hands
headed
me
up
in
a
cask
and
although
the
vessel
was
not
permitted
to
sail
until
very
strict
search
had
been
made
for
me
i
was
not
discovered
and
it
was
supposed
that
i
had
been
drowned
in
making
the
attempt
aware
that
it
would
not
be
good
for
my
health
to
return
previously
to
the
expiration
of
the
seven
years
i
determined
to
learn
a
new
that
of
a
sailor
for
which
i
always
had
a
predilection
besides
it
quieted
my
conscience
as
to
the
impropriety
of
not
submitting
to
the
just
punishment
of
the
law
as
you
will
acknowledge
that
seven
years
at
sea
and
seven
transportation
are
one
and
the
same
thing
from
batavia
i
went
to
calcutta
and
worked
before
the
mast
in
the
country
vessels
to
bombay
and
the
persian
gulf
for
four
years
when
i
thought
myself
capable
of
taking
higher
rank
in
the
service
if
i
could
get
it
especially
as
i
had
picked
up
sufficient
navigation
to
be
able
to
work
the
reckoning
at
calcutta
i
obtained
a
situation
as
second
mate
of
a
schooner
employed
in
the
smuggling
of
opium
into
china
and
after
three
voyages
rose
to
the
office
of
chief
mate
had
i
remained
another
voyage
i
should
have
been
captain
of
the
vessel
but
my
seven
years
were
out
and
i
was
anxious
to
return
to
england
and
look
the
red
boldly
in
the
face
i
had
saved
enough
money
to
pay
my
passage
and
was
determined
to
go
home
like
a
gentleman
if
i
had
not
exactly
gone
out
in
that
character
what
little
cash
remained
after
my
passage
was
paid
i
lost
at
play
to
an
army
officer
who
was
returning
in
the
same
ship
when
i
landed
at
portsmouth
i
retained
a
suit
of
togs
as
we
call
them
and
disposing
of
all
the
rest
of
my
stock
to
the
jews
i
started
for
london
on
my
arrival
i
found
that
my
father
and
mother
were
both
dead
and
i
was
meditating
upon
my
future
course
of
when
an
accident
determined
me
i
picked
up
a
here
captain
debriseau
eyed
him
hard
i
know
what
you
mean
continued
mcelvina
but
it
on
the
pavement
and
not
a
as
you
would
imply
by
your
looks
it
was
full
of
slips
and
scraps
of
paper
of
all
sorts
which
i
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
only
available
articles
it
contained
were
three
notes
the
owner
name
and
address
were
written
on
the
first
blank
leaf
i
can
not
tell
what
possessed
me
but
i
had
an
irresistible
desire
to
be
honest
once
in
my
life
and
the
temptation
to
be
otherwise
not
being
very
great
i
took
the
to
the
address
and
arrived
at
the
house
just
as
the
old
gentleman
to
whom
it
belonged
was
giving
to
have
it
advertised
he
was
in
evident
perturbation
at
his
loss
and
i
came
just
at
the
fortunate
moment
he
seized
his
book
with
rapture
examined
all
the
papers
and
counted
over
the
bills
and
notes
is
a
scarce
commodity
young
man
said
he
as
he
passed
the
leathern
tongue
of
the
book
through
the
strap
have
brought
me
my
book
without
waiting
till
a
reward
was
offered
i
desired
my
clerk
to
offer
twenty
guineas
in
the
advertisement
i
will
now
give
you
a
larger
sum
he
sat
down
opened
a
and
wrote
me
a
draft
on
his
banker
it
was
for
one
hundred
pounds
i
was
profuse
in
my
acknowledgments
while
he
replaced
his
book
in
his
and
buttoned
up
his
coat
is
a
scarce
commodity
young
man
repeated
he
here
at
one
and
i
will
see
if
i
can
be
of
any
further
service
to
you
i
returned
to
my
lodgings
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
i
was
astonished
at
the
old
man
generosity
and
still
more
at
my
having
honestly
obtained
so
large
a
sum
i
went
to
bed
and
reflected
on
what
had
passed
the
words
of
the
old
gentleman
still
rang
in
my
ears
is
a
scarce
commodity
i
communed
with
myself
here
have
i
been
nearly
all
my
life
exercising
all
my
talents
exerting
all
my
energies
in
dishonest
practices
and
when
did
i
even
at
the
most
successful
hit
obtain
as
much
money
as
i
have
by
an
honest
act
i
recalled
the
many
days
of
anxious
waiting
that
i
had
found
necessary
to
accomplish
a
scheme
of
fraud
the
doubtful
success
the
necessity
of
satisfying
my
associates
the
inability
of
turning
into
ready
money
the
articles
purloined
until
the
hue
and
cry
was
over
the
trifling
sum
which
i
was
obliged
to
take
from
the
purchasers
of
stolen
articles
who
knew
that
i
was
at
their
mercy
the
destitute
condition
i
occasionally
was
in
and
the
life
of
constant
anxiety
that
i
had
led
these
reflections
forced
the
truth
upon
my
mind
that
there
was
more
in
the
end
to
be
gained
by
honesty
than
by
roguery
once
convinced
i
determined
to
lead
a
new
life
and
from
that
moment
i
assumed
as
my
motto
is
the
best
policy
do
you
hear
youngster
be
honest
chapter
eleven
through
tattered
clothes
small
vices
do
appear
robes
and
furred
gowns
hide
all
lear
willy
who
was
tired
out
with
the
extreme
mental
and
bodily
exertion
that
he
had
undergone
gave
no
answer
to
mcelvina
injunction
except
a
loud
snore
which
satisfied
the
captain
that
his
caution
in
this
instance
was
not
heard
well
said
debriseau
after
a
short
pause
how
long
did
this
honest
fit
last
what
do
you
mean
how
long
did
it
last
why
it
has
lasted
captain
debriseau
it
has
lasted
until
now
and
shall
last
too
as
long
as
this
frame
of
mine
shall
hold
together
but
to
proceed
the
next
morning
i
called
upon
the
old
gentleman
according
to
his
request
he
again
told
me
was
a
scarce
commodity
i
could
have
informed
him
that
it
had
always
been
so
with
me
but
i
kept
my
own
counsel
he
then
asked
me
what
were
my
profession
and
pursuits
now
as
i
had
two
professions
to
choose
between
and
as
my
last
was
considered
to
be
just
as
abundant
in
the
commodity
he
prized
so
much
as
my
former
one
was
known
to
be
deficient
i
replied
that
i
was
a
seafaring
man
i
may
find
some
employment
for
you
replied
the
old
gentleman
and
having
put
several
questions
to
me
as
to
the
nature
of
the
service
i
had
seen
he
desired
me
to
take
a
walk
till
three
when
he
would
be
happy
to
see
me
at
dinner
then
be
able
to
have
a
little
conversation
together
without
being
i
was
exact
to
my
appointment
and
my
old
friend
who
was
punctuality
itself
did
not
allow
me
to
remain
in
the
parlour
two
minutes
before
dinner
was
on
the
table
as
soon
as
it
was
over
he
dismissed
the
servant
girl
who
attended
and
turned
the
key
in
the
door
after
sounding
me
on
many
points
during
a
rapid
discussion
of
the
first
bottle
of
port
he
proceeded
to
inform
me
that
a
friend
of
his
wanted
a
smart
fellow
as
captain
of
a
vessel
if
i
would
like
the
employment
this
suited
me
and
he
then
observed
that
i
must
have
some
notion
of
how
officers
were
managed
as
i
had
been
in
the
china
trade
and
that
he
that
the
vessel
was
to
be
employed
in
the
contraband
trade
on
the
english
coast
this
startled
me
a
little
for
i
was
afraid
that
the
old
gentleman
was
laying
a
trap
for
my
commodity
and
i
was
about
to
refuse
with
some
slight
show
of
indignation
when
i
perceived
a
change
in
his
countenance
indicative
of
disappointment
so
i
only
demurred
until
he
had
sufficient
time
to
prove
that
there
was
no
dishonesty
in
the
transaction
when
being
convinced
that
he
was
in
earnest
i
consented
before
the
second
bottle
was
finished
i
found
out
that
it
was
not
for
a
but
for
himself
and
for
one
of
his
own
vessels
that
he
was
anxious
to
procure
a
smart
captain
and
that
he
had
a
large
capital
embarked
in
the
concern
which
was
very
profitable
the
which
i
had
returned
was
of
no
little
importance
had
it
fallen
into
other
hands
it
might
have
told
tales
i
have
now
been
three
years
in
the
old
gentleman
employ
and
a
generous
good
master
he
has
been
and
his
daughter
is
a
sweet
pretty
girl
i
lost
my
last
vessel
but
not
until
she
had
cleared
him
pounds
and
now
the
old
gentleman
is
building
me
another
at
havre
not
to
be
quite
idle
i
have
in
the
meantime
taken
command
of
one
of
their
sloops
for
the
old
gentleman
has
a
good
many
shares
in
the
and
his
recommendations
are
always
attended
to
monsieur
beaujou
avec
les
said
the
maitre
opening
the
door
and
ushering
in
the
marchand
des
modes
with
a
huge
bundle
now
then
boy
rouse
out
said
mcelvina
shaking
our
hero
for
a
long
while
without
any
symptoms
of
recovering
him
from
his
lethargy
try
him
on
the
other
tack
said
the
captain
lifting
him
off
the
sofa
and
placing
him
upright
on
his
legs
there
no
sugar
in
it
yet
said
willy
who
was
dreaming
that
he
was
supplying
the
mulled
claret
to
the
old
master
mate
ah
said
debriseau
laughing
he
thinks
his
mamma
is
giving
him
his
tea
the
lying
little
rascal
told
me
this
morning
that
he
had
no
mother
come
mr
william
seymour
i
mimicking
officer
i
oh
you
a
nice
honest
boy
have
you
a
mother
or
do
you
tell
fibs
in
your
sleep
as
well
as
awake
honest
the
last
words
that
willy
had
heard
repeated
so
often
during
the
day
not
only
unsealed
his
eyes
but
recalled
to
his
recollection
where
he
was
now
my
youngster
let
us
rig
you
out
you
recollect
you
stated
that
you
were
going
home
for
your
outfit
and
now
i
give
you
one
that
you
may
have
one
fib
less
on
your
conscience
by
the
generosity
of
mcelvina
willy
was
soon
fitted
with
two
suits
of
clothes
requiring
little
alteration
and
mr
beaujou
having
received
a
further
order
for
a
supply
of
shirts
and
other
articles
necessary
to
complete
made
his
bow
and
disappeared
the
two
captains
resumed
their
chairs
and
our
hero
again
coiled
himself
on
the
sofa
and
in
one
minute
was
as
sound
asleep
as
before
and
now
mcelvina
resumed
debriseau
i
should
like
to
know
by
what
arguments
your
employer
contrived
to
reconcile
your
present
vocation
with
your
punctilious
regard
for
honesty
for
i
must
confess
for
my
own
part
that
although
i
have
followed
smuggling
as
a
livelihood
i
have
never
defended
it
as
an
honest
calling
and
have
looked
forward
with
occasional
impatience
to
the
time
when
i
should
be
able
to
leave
it
off
defend
it
why
i
just
repeat
to
you
the
arguments
used
by
the
old
gentleman
they
convinced
me
as
i
said
before
i
am
always
open
to
conviction
captain
debriseau
you
will
acknowledge
i
trust
that
laws
are
made
for
the
benefit
of
all
parties
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
granted
you
allow
also
that
should
not
be
lawbreakers
and
that
if
they
are
so
they
can
not
expect
that
others
will
regard
what
they
disregard
themselves
granted
also
once
more
by
the
laws
of
our
country
the
receiver
is
as
bad
as
the
thief
and
they
who
instigate
others
to
commit
an
offence
are
equally
guilty
with
the
offending
party
it
can
not
be
denied
replied
debriseau
then
you
have
acceded
to
all
the
propositions
that
i
wish
and
we
shall
come
to
an
undeniable
and
mathematical
conclusion
observe
should
not
be
who
enacted
these
laws
the
aristocracy
of
the
nation
seated
in
their
respective
houses
the
lords
and
the
commons
go
any
night
you
please
to
the
opera
or
any
other
place
of
public
resort
in
which
you
can
have
a
view
of
their
wives
and
daughter
i
stake
my
existence
that
every
female
there
shall
be
disened
out
in
some
contraband
article
of
dress
not
one
but
shall
prove
to
be
a
receiver
of
smuggled
goods
and
therefore
as
bad
as
those
whom
they
have
instigated
to
the
laws
of
their
country
if
there
were
no
demand
there
would
be
no
supply
surely
they
do
drink
gin
replied
debriseau
drink
gin
you
thinking
of
your
damned
cherbourg
trade
your
ideas
are
confined
is
there
nothing
smuggled
besides
gin
now
if
the
husbands
and
fathers
of
these
ladies
those
who
have
themselves
enacted
the
laws
wink
at
their
why
should
not
others
do
so
the
only
distinction
between
the
equally
offending
parties
is
that
those
who
are
in
power
who
possess
all
the
comforts
and
luxuries
which
this
world
can
afford
who
offend
the
laws
from
vanity
and
caprice
and
entice
the
needy
to
administer
to
their
love
of
display
are
protected
and
unpunished
while
the
adventurous
seaman
whose
means
of
supporting
his
family
depend
upon
his
administering
to
their
wishes
or
the
poor
devil
who
is
unfortunately
detected
with
a
gallon
of
spirits
is
thrown
into
gaol
as
if
he
were
a
there
can
not
be
one
law
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
poor
debriseau
when
i
hear
that
the
wives
of
the
aristocracy
have
been
seized
by
the
revenue
officers
and
the
contraband
articles
which
they
wear
have
been
taken
off
their
backs
and
that
they
have
been
sentenced
to
twelve
months
imprisonment
by
a
committal
from
the
magistrate
then
and
not
till
then
will
i
acknowledge
our
profession
to
be
very
true
said
debriseau
it
shows
the
folly
of
men
attempting
to
make
laws
for
their
is
it
not
shocking
continued
mcelvina
to
reflect
upon
the
conduct
of
the
magistrate
who
has
just
sentenced
perhaps
four
or
five
unhappy
wretches
to
a
dungeon
for
an
offence
against
these
laws
he
leaves
the
seat
of
justice
and
returns
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
here
his
wife
mimicking
my
dear
you
come
at
last
dinner
has
been
put
back
this
i
thought
you
would
never
have
finished
with
those
odious
smugglers
my
love
it
was
a
very
difficult
case
to
prove
but
we
managed
it
at
last
and
i
have
signed
the
warrant
for
their
committal
to
the
county
gaol
they
sad
troublesome
fellows
these
smugglers
now
look
at
the
lady
dress
is
that
you
put
on
to
greet
your
husband
de
naples
de
lyon
lace
it
is
trimmed
with
gloves
madam
de
paris
ribands
your
shoes
your
handkerchief
all
all
worthy
magistrate
if
you
would
hold
the
scales
of
justice
with
an
even
hand
make
out
mittimus
before
you
sit
down
to
table
send
your
wife
to
languish
a
twelvemonth
in
company
with
the
poor
smugglers
and
then
dinner
with
what
appetite
you
may
and
now
debriseau
have
i
convinced
you
that
i
may
follow
my
present
calling
and
still
say
why
yes
i
think
we
both
may
but
would
not
this
evil
be
removed
by
free
trade
heaven
forbid
replied
mcelvina
laughing
then
there
would
be
no
chapter
twelve
love
me
love
my
dog
proverb
it
is
the
misfortune
of
those
who
have
been
in
constant
habits
of
deceit
that
they
always
imagine
others
are
attempting
the
same
dishonest
practices
for
some
time
mcelvina
felt
convinced
that
our
little
hero
had
swerved
from
truth
in
the
account
which
he
gave
of
himself
and
it
was
not
until
after
repeated
catechisings
in
which
he
found
that
strange
and
improbable
as
the
narrative
appeared
willy
never
altered
from
or
contradicted
his
original
statement
that
he
believed
the
boy
to
be
as
honest
and
ingenuous
as
might
have
been
inferred
from
his
prepossessing
countenance
to
this
conviction
how
ever
did
he
arrive
at
last
and
our
hero
who
seemed
no
sooner
to
have
lost
one
protector
than
to
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
another
became
the
favourite
and
companion
of
his
new
captain
instead
of
his
domestic
as
had
been
originally
contemplated
a
lad
of
willy
age
who
is
treated
with
kindness
and
consideration
is
soon
attached
and
becomes
reconciled
to
any
change
of
circumstances
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
our
hero
whether
he
was
on
the
of
a
or
in
the
cabin
of
a
smuggling
sloop
contented
with
his
present
lot
with
the
happy
thoughtlessness
of
youth
he
never
permitted
the
future
to
disturb
his
repose
or
affect
his
digestion
willy
had
been
nearly
a
month
at
cherbourg
when
mcelvina
sloop
took
in
another
cargo
willy
said
mcelvina
one
evening
as
they
sat
together
in
the
apartment
at
the
cabaret
i
shall
in
all
probability
sail
for
the
english
coast
i
have
been
thinking
what
i
shall
do
with
you
i
do
not
much
like
parting
with
you
but
on
reflection
i
think
it
will
be
better
that
i
should
leave
you
behind
you
can
be
of
no
use
and
may
be
in
the
way
if
we
should
be
obliged
to
take
to
our
boat
willy
pleaded
hard
against
this
arrangement
i
never
have
a
friend
but
i
lose
him
directly
said
the
boy
and
the
tears
started
into
his
eyes
i
trust
you
will
not
lose
me
my
dear
fellow
replied
mcelvina
moved
at
this
proof
of
affection
but
i
must
explain
to
you
why
i
leave
you
in
the
first
place
added
he
laughing
with
that
mark
on
your
shoulder
it
would
be
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
for
you
to
be
found
in
my
possession
but
of
that
i
would
run
the
risk
my
serious
reasons
are
as
follow
if
this
trip
proves
fortunate
i
shall
not
return
to
cherbourg
i
have
business
of
importance
in
london
which
may
require
my
presence
for
some
weeks
in
that
metropolis
and
its
vicinity
i
told
you
before
that
i
am
about
to
take
the
command
of
a
very
different
vessel
from
this
paltry
sloop
and
upon
a
more
dangerous
service
in
four
or
five
months
she
will
be
ready
to
sail
and
during
that
time
i
shall
be
constantly
on
the
move
and
shall
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
you
now
willy
you
are
not
aware
of
the
advantages
of
education
i
am
and
as
mine
was
given
to
me
by
strangers
so
will
i
in
return
bestow
as
much
upon
you
as
i
can
afford
you
must
therefore
go
to
school
until
my
return
you
will
at
least
acquire
the
french
language
and
you
will
find
that
of
no
little
use
to
you
hereafter
willy
accustomed
to
discipline
and
to
breathe
the
air
of
passive
obedience
submitted
without
raising
any
more
objections
debriseau
joined
and
they
all
three
sallied
forth
to
make
arrangements
for
placing
our
hero
where
they
had
been
recommended
having
effected
this
they
agreed
to
lounge
on
the
till
sunset
when
they
took
possession
of
one
of
the
benches
mcelvina
and
debriseau
lighted
their
cigars
and
puffed
away
in
silence
while
willy
amused
himself
with
watching
the
promenaders
as
they
passed
in
review
before
him
they
had
not
remained
there
many
minutes
when
a
and
white
as
a
sheep
from
the
river
before
the
day
of
shearing
walked
up
to
them
with
an
air
of
sagacious
curiosity
and
looked
mcelvina
steadfastly
in
the
face
mcelvina
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
held
it
to
the
dog
who
ran
up
to
it
as
if
to
smell
it
the
lighted
end
coming
in
contact
with
his
cold
nose
induced
the
animal
to
set
up
a
loud
yell
and
retreat
to
his
master
much
faster
than
he
came
passing
first
one
and
then
the
other
over
his
nose
to
wipe
away
the
pain
in
such
a
ridiculous
manner
as
to
excite
loud
merriment
not
only
from
our
party
on
the
bench
but
also
from
others
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
so
much
for
curiosity
said
mcelvina
continuing
his
mirth
the
proprietor
of
the
dog
a
young
frenchman
dressed
very
much
did
not
however
seem
quite
so
much
amused
with
this
practical
joke
he
cocked
his
hat
fiercely
on
one
side
raised
his
figure
to
the
utmost
of
its
height
and
walking
up
grand
addressed
mcelvina
with
monsieur
vous
avez
fait
une
grande
vous
i
think
i
had
better
not
understand
french
said
mcelvina
aside
to
debriseau
then
turning
to
the
frenchman
with
a
grave
face
and
air
of
incomprehension
what
did
you
say
sir
ah

his
head

the

came
up
to
his
master
est

le
monsieur

said
mcelvina
taking
off
his
hat
with
mock
gravity
to
the
dog
who
seemed
determined
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
vous
demande
mille
que
cried
some
of
the
fair
sex
who
as
well
as
the
men
had
been
attracted
by
and
were
listening
to
the
dispute
monsieur
est
drole
et
voyez
moustache
comme
il

said
his
master
who
was
now
all
smiles
la

ah

monsieur

i
should
esteem
myself
fortunate
if
i
spoke
your
language
as
well
as
you
do
mine
replied
mcelvina
in
french
this
compliment
before
so
many
bystanders
completely
won
the
heart
of
the
vain
and
choleric
frenchman
ah
sare
you
are
too
complaisant
i
hope
i
shall
have
de
pleasure
to
make
your
acquaintance
monsieur

my

madame
will
be
delighted
to
receive
a
monsieur
of
so
much
vit
and

so
saying
away
went
monsieur
auguste
de
poivre
followed
by
moustache
who
was
von
and
de
same
well
we
live
and
learn
said
mcelvina
laughing
as
soon
as
the
frenchman
was
at
a
little
distance
i
never
thought
that
i
should
have
made
an
apology
to
a
dog
oh
but
replied
debriseau
you
forget
that
he
was
chien
de
you
may
imagine
from
my
behaviour
that
i
consider
him
a
wiser
puppy
than
his
master
for
he
ran
away
from
fire
whereas
his
master
tried
all
he
could
to
get
into
it
some
of
our
countrymen
would
have
humoured
him
and
turned
a
comedy
into
a
tragedy
i
set
a
proper
value
on
my
life
and
do
not
choose
to
risk
it
about
trifles
there
has
been
more
than
one
valuable
life
thrown
away
about
a
dog
in
my
remembrance
said
debriseau
i
think
you
behaved
in
a
sensible
manner
to
get
rid
of
the
affair
as
you
did
but
you
would
have
done
better
not
to
have
burnt
the
dog
nose
granted
replied
mcelvina
the
more
so
as
i
have
often
remarked
that
there
is
no
object
in
the
world
except
your
children
or
your
own
self
in
which
the
is
so
powerful
and
the
so
weak
you
caress
your
own
dog
and
kick
a
strange
one
you
are
pleased
with
the
clamorous
barking
of
your
own
cur
and
you
curse
the
same
noise
from
another
the
feeling
is
as
powerful
almost
as
that
of
a
mother
who
thinks
her
own
ugly
cub
a
cherub
compared
to
others
and
its
squallings
the
music
of
the
spheres
it
is
because
there
is
no
being
that
administers
so
much
to
the
of
his
master
he
submits
with
humility
to
the
blows
inflicted
in
the
moment
of
irritation
and
licks
the
hand
that
corrects
he
bears
no
revengeful
feelings
and
is
ready
to
fondle
and
caress
you
the
moment
that
your
good
humour
returns
he
is
what
man
looks
in
vain
for
among
his
kind
a
faithful
friend
without
contradiction
the
perfection
of
a
the
abject
submission
on
his
part
which
would
induce
you
to
despise
him
becomes
a
merit
when
you
consider
his
courage
his
fidelity
and
his
gratitude
i
can
not
think
what
mahomet
was
about
when
he
pronounced
his
fiat
against
them
as
well
said
debriseau
i
agree
with
mahomet
that
they
are
especially
puppies
there
that
little
beast
at
monsieur
picardon
i
declare
pooh
interrupted
mcelvina
laughing
i
do
mean
it
in
that
sense
i
mean
that
in
a
despotic
country
the
conduct
of
a
dog
towards
his
master
should
be
held
up
as
an
example
for
imitation
and
i
think
that
the
banner
of
the
moslem
should
have
borne
the
dog
instead
of
the
crescent
as
an
emblem
of
blind
fidelity
and
tacit
submission
that
very
true
said
debriseau
but
nevertheless
i
wish
mademoiselle
puppy
were
either
taught
manners
or
thrown
over
the
quay
pas
un
chien
de
replied
mcelvina
laughing
but
it
is
nearly
dark
au
they
returned
to
the
inn
and
the
wind
on
the
ensuing
morning
blowing
strong
from
a
favourable
quarter
willy
and
debriseau
accompanied
mcelvina
down
to
the
mole
from
whence
he
embarked
on
board
of
the
sloop
which
was
already
under
way
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
was
out
of
sight
on
the
following
day
captain
debriseau
accompanied
willy
to
the
where
our
hero
remained
nearly
five
months
occasionally
visited
by
the
guernsey
captain
when
he
returned
from
his
smuggling
trips
and
more
rarely
receiving
a
letter
from
mcelvina
who
had
safely
landed
his
cargo
and
was
latterly
at
havre
superintending
the
fitting
out
of
his
new
vessel
our
hero
made
good
progress
during
the
few
months
that
he
remained
at
the
and
when
mcelvina
returned
to
take
him
away
not
only
could
speak
the
french
language
with
fluency
but
had
also
made
considerable
progress
in
what
sir
c
used
to
designate
in
his
toast
as
the
three
r
reading
and
the
lugger
which
had
been
built
for
mcelvina
by
his
employer
was
now
ready
and
bidding
farewell
to
debriseau
who
continued
in
the
cherbourg
trade
our
hero
and
his
protector
journeyed
to
havre
chapter
thirteen
through
the
haze
of
the
night
a
bright
flash
now
appearing
oh
ho
cried
will
watch
the
philistines
bear
down
bear
a
hand
my
tight
lads
ere
we
think
about
sheering
one
broadside
pour
in
should
we
swim
boys
or
drown
sea
song
now
willy
what
do
you
think
of
belle
said
mcelvina
as
they
stood
on
the
pier
about
a
stone
throw
from
the
vessel
which
lay
with
her
broadside
towards
them
not
that
mcelvina
had
any
opinion
of
willy
judgment
but
from
the
affectionate
feeling
which
every
sailor
imbibes
for
his
own
ship
he
expected
gratification
even
in
the
admiration
of
a
child
the
lugger
was
certainly
as
beautiful
a
model
of
that
description
of
vessel
as
had
ever
been
launched
from
a
slip
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
with
the
sea
running
it
was
but
occasionally
that
you
could
perceive
her
long
black
hull
so
low
was
she
in
the
water
and
so
completely
were
her
bulwarks
pared
down
yet
her
breadth
of
beam
was
very
great
and
her
tonnage
considerable
as
may
be
inferred
when
it
is
stated
that
she
mounted
sixteen
long
brass
and
was
manned
with
one
hundred
and
thirty
men
but
now
that
she
was
lying
at
anchor
in
smooth
water
you
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
with
the
severest
scrutiny
the
beautiful
run
of
the
vessel
as
she
sat
graceful
as
a
diver
and
appeared
like
that
aquatic
bird
ready
to
plunge
in
at
a
moment
and
disappear
under
the
wave
cleft
by
her
sharp
forefoot
and
rippling
under
her
bows
when
shall
we
sail
inquired
willy
after
bestowing
more
judicious
encomiums
upon
the
vessel
than
might
be
expected
night
if
the
wind
holds
to
the
southward
we
took
in
our
powder
this
morning
where
were
you
stationed
at
quarters
on
board
the
nowhere
i
was
not
on
the
ship
books
until
a
day
or
two
before
i
left
her
then
you
must
be
a
with
me
you
can
hand
powder
up
if
you
can
do
nothing
else
i
can
do
more
replied
willy
proudly
i
can
roll
shells
overboard
ay
ay
so
you
can
i
forgot
that
i
suppose
i
must
put
you
on
the
and
make
an
officer
of
you
as
captain
m
intended
to
do
i
mean
to
stand
by
you
when
we
fight
said
willy
taking
hand
thank
you
that
may
not
be
so
lucky
i
rather
superstitious
and
if
i
recollect
right
your
old
friend
adams
had
that
honour
when
he
was
killed
the
name
of
old
adams
being
mentioned
made
willy
silent
and
unhappy
mcelvina
perceived
it
the
conversation
was
dropped
and
they
returned
home
a
few
days
afterwards
belle
sailed
amidst
the
shouts
and
vivas
of
the
multitude
collected
on
the
pier
and
a
thousand
wishes
for
and
the
builder
clapping
his
hands
and
skipping
with
all
the
simial
ecstasy
of
a
frenchman
at
the
encomiums
lavished
upon
his
vessel
as
she
cleaved
through
the
water
with
the
undeviating
rapidity
of
a
barracouta
but
the
and
the
shouts
and
the
builder
and
the
pier
that
he
capered
on
were
soon
out
of
sight
and
our
hero
was
once
more
confiding
in
the
trackless
and
treacherous
ocean
well
she
walk
said
phillips
who
had
followed
the
fortunes
of
his
captain
and
was
now
looking
over
the
quarter
of
the
vessel
she
must
be
a
clipper
as
catches
us
with
the
tacks
on
board
right
in
the
wind
eye
too
clean
full
by
the
powers
i
believe
if
you
were
to
lift
her
she
would
lay
a
point
on
the
other
side
of
the
wind
get
another
pull
of
the
my
lads
cried
mcelvina
these
new
ropes
stretch
most
confoundedly
there
belay
all
that
take
a
turn
and
do
come
up
an
inch
the
breeze
freshened
and
the
lugger
flew
through
the
water
dashing
the
white
spray
from
her
bows
into
the
air
where
it
formed
little
rainbows
as
it
was
pierced
by
the
beams
of
the
setting
sun
we
shall
have
a
fine
night
and
light
weather
towards
the
morning
i
think
said
the
first
mate
addressing
mcelvina
i
think
so
too
turn
the
hands
up
to
muster
by
the
we
load
the
guns
as
soon
as
the
lights
are
out
let
the
gunner
fill
forty
rounds
and
desire
the
carpenter
to
nail
up
the
let
them
be
rolled
up
and
stopped
we
keep
them
up
for
a
till
we
return
to
havre
the
crew
of
the
lugger
were
now
summoned
on
deck
by
the
call
of
the
boatswain
and
having
been
addressed
by
captain
mcelvina
upon
the
absolute
necessity
of
activity
and
preparation
in
a
service
of
such
peculiar
risk
they
loaded
the
guns
and
secured
them
for
the
night
the
crew
consisted
of
about
eighty
or
ninety
englishmen
out
of
the
full
complement
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
men
the
remainder
was
composed
of
frenchmen
and
other
continental
adventurers
although
the
respective
countries
were
at
variance
the
subjects
of
each
had
shaken
hands
that
they
might
assist
each
other
in
violating
the
laws
the
quiet
and
subordination
of
a
king
ship
were
not
to
be
expected
here
loud
and
obstreperous
mirth
occasional
quarrelling
as
one
party
by
accident
or
intention
wounded
the
national
pride
of
the
other
french
english
and
irish
spoken
alternately
or
at
the
same
moment
created
a
degree
of
confusion
which
proved
that
the
reins
of
government
were
held
lightly
by
the
captain
in
matters
of
small
importance
but
although
there
was
a
general
freedom
of
manner
and
independence
of
address
still
his
authority
was
acknowledged
and
his
orders
implicitly
obeyed
it
was
a
ship
company
which
every
as
the
saying
is
when
there
was
nothing
to
demand
union
but
let
difficulty
or
danger
appear
and
all
their
squabbling
was
forgotten
or
reserved
for
a
more
seasonable
opportunity
then
they
all
those
of
each
nation
vying
in
taking
the
lead
and
setting
an
example
to
the
other
such
was
the
crew
of
the
lugger
which
mcelvina
commanded
all
of
whom
were
picked
men
remarkable
for
their
strength
and
activity
as
the
first
mate
had
predicted
the
wind
fell
light
after
midnight
and
at
dawn
of
day
the
lugger
was
gliding
through
the
smooth
water
at
the
rate
of
three
or
four
miles
an
hour
shrouded
in
a
thick
fog
the
sun
rose
and
had
gained
about
twenty
degrees
of
altitude
when
mcelvina
beat
to
quarters
that
he
might
accustom
his
men
to
the
exercise
of
the
guns
the
rays
of
the
sun
had
not
power
to
pierce
through
the
fog
and
shorn
of
his
beams
he
had
more
the
appearance
of
an
overgrown
moon
or
was
as
phillips
quaintly
observed
like
a
man
disguised
in
attire
the
exercise
of
the
guns
had
not
long
continued
when
the
breeze
freshened
up
and
the
fog
began
partially
to
disperse
willy
who
was
perched
on
the
abaft
observed
a
dark
mass
looming
through
the
mist
on
the
weather
beam
is
that
a
vessel
said
willy
pointing
it
out
to
the
first
mate
who
was
standing
near
mcelvina
indeed
it
is
my
boy
replied
the
mate
you
a
sharp
eye
of
your
own
mcelvina
glass
was
already
on
the
object
a
cutter
right
before
the
wind
coming
down
to
us
a
government
vessel
of
some
sort
or
another
i
swear
i
trust
she
a
revenue
cruiser
i
have
an
account
to
settle
with
those
gentlemen
stay
at
your
quarters
my
lads
hand
up
shot
and
open
the
magazine
the
powerful
rays
of
the
sun
assisted
by
the
increasing
wind
now
rolled
away
the
fog
from
around
the
vessels
which
had
a
perfect
view
of
each
other
they
were
distant
about
two
miles
and
the
blue
water
was
strongly
rippled
by
the
breeze
which
had
sprung
up
the
lugger
continued
her
course
on
a
wind
while
the
cutter
bore
down
towards
her
with
all
the
sail
that
she
could
throw
out
the
fog
continued
to
clear
away
until
there
was
an
open
space
of
about
three
or
four
miles
in
diameter
but
it
still
remained
folded
up
in
deep
masses
forming
a
wall
on
every
side
which
obscured
the
horizon
from
their
sight
it
appeared
as
if
nature
had
gratuitously
cleared
away
a
sufficient
portion
of
the
mist
and
had
thus
arranged
a
little
amphitheatre
for
the
approaching
combat
between
the
two
vessels
his
colours
are
up
sir
revenue
stripes
by
the
lord
cried
phillips
then
all
right
replied
mcelvina
the
cutter
had
now
run
down
within
half
a
mile
of
the
lugger
who
had
continued
her
course
with
the
most
perfect
when
she
the
commander
of
the
vessel
aware
at
the
first
discovery
of
the
lugger
that
she
could
be
no
other
than
an
enemy
who
would
most
probably
give
him
some
trouble
had
made
every
preparation
for
the
engagement
shall
we
hoist
any
colours
sir
said
the
first
mate
to
mcelvina
no
if
we
hoist
english
he
will
not
commence
action
until
he
has
made
the
private
signal
and
all
manner
of
parleying
which
is
quite
unnecessary
he
knows
what
we
are
well
enough
shall
we
hoist
a
french
ensign
sir
no
i
fight
under
no
other
colours
than
those
of
old
england
even
when
i
resist
her
authority
a
long
column
of
white
smoke
now
rolled
along
the
surface
of
the
water
as
the
cutter
who
had
waited
in
vain
for
the
colours
being
hoisted
fired
the
first
gun
at
her
antagonist
the
shot
whizzed
between
the
masts
of
the
lugger
and
plunged
into
the
water
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
leeward
vous
roared
out
a
french
on
board
of
the
lugger
in
imitation
of
the
compliments
which
take
place
previously
to
an
at
the
same
time
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
to
the
cutter
too
high
too
high
good
mr
searcher
said
mcelvina
laughing
depress
your
guns
to
her
waterline
my
lads
and
do
not
fire
until
i
order
you
the
remainder
of
the
cutter
broadside
was
now
discharged
at
the
lugger
but
the
elevation
being
too
great
the
shot
whizzed
over
without
any
injury
to
her
crew
the
were
however
shot
away
and
the
yard
and
sail
fell
thundering
down
on
the
deck
be
smart
my
lads
and
bend
on
again
it
quite
long
enough
up
with
the
sail
and
we
return
the
compliment
in
less
than
a
minute
the
tie
of
the
halyards
which
had
been
divided
close
to
the
yard
was
hitched
round
it
and
the
sail
again
expanded
to
the
breeze
now
my
lads
remember
do
throw
a
shot
away
fire
when
you
ready
the
broadside
of
the
lugger
was
poured
into
the
cutter
with
what
effect
upon
the
crew
could
not
be
ascertained
but
the
was
cut
in
half
and
the
outer
part
of
it
fell
over
the
cutter
quarter
and
was
dragged
astern
by
the
clew
of
the
sail
it
all
over
with
her
already
said
the
to
mcelvina
and
as
the
cutter
payed
off
before
the
wind
another
broadside
from
her
antagonist
raked
her
fore
and
aft
the
cutter
hauled
down
her
jib
eased
off
her
and
succeeded
in
again
bringing
her
broadside
to
bear
the
action
was
now
maintained
with
spirit
but
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
cutter
who
was
not
only
inferior
in
force
but
completely
disabled
from
the
loss
of
her
after
an
exchange
of
a
dozen
broadsides
mcelvina
shot
the
lugger
ahead
and
tacking
under
his
adversary
bows
raked
him
a
second
time
the
commander
of
the
revenue
vessel
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
a
similar
disaster
payed
his
vessel
off
before
the
wind
and
returned
the
fire
as
they
came
abreast
of
each
other
but
in
these
manoeuvres
the
lugger
obtained
the
it
was
however
a
point
of
little
consequence
as
matters
then
stood
in
a
few
more
broadsides
the
cutter
was
a
complete
wreck
and
unable
to
return
the
fire
of
her
opponent
her
and
halyards
had
been
cut
away
her
was
down
on
deck
and
her
jib
lying
overboard
under
her
bows
i
think
that
will
do
said
mcelvina
to
the
we
had
better
be
off
now
for
our
guns
will
be
sure
to
bring
down
some
of
the
cruisers
and
if
she
surrendered
i
could
not
take
possession
of
her
let
give
her
a
parting
broadside
and
three
cheers
mcelvina
orders
were
obeyed
but
not
one
gun
was
returned
by
the
cutter
starboard
a
little
keep
her
away
now
and
we
close
and
stand
ahead
of
her
that
she
may
read
our
name
on
the
stern
it
a
pity
they
should
not
know
to
whom
they
are
indebted
they
not
forget
belle
the
cutter
had
not
been
left
a
mile
astern
before
the
breeze
freshened
and
the
fog
began
rapidly
to
disperse
and
phillips
who
continued
at
the
conn
perceived
through
the
haze
a
large
vessel
bearing
down
towards
them
high
time
that
we
were
off
indeed
captain
for
there
a
cruiser
if
i
mistake
not
a
gun
here
is
the
same
to
the
cruiser
as
a
splash
in
the
water
is
to
the
ground
sharks
at
antigua
up
they
all
come
to
see
what
to
be
had
we
shall
have
a
dozen
of
them
above
the
horizon
before
two
hours
are
above
our
heads
mcelvina
who
had
his
glass
fixed
upon
the
vessel
soon
made
her
out
to
be
a
frigate
coming
down
under
a
press
of
sail
attracted
as
phillips
had
remarked
by
the
reports
of
the
guns
what
made
the
affair
more
serious
was
that
she
was
evidently
bringing
down
a
strong
breeze
which
the
lugger
although
steering
large
had
not
yet
obtained
moreover
the
fog
had
dispersed
in
all
directions
and
the
frigate
neared
them
fast
blast
the
cutter
said
the
we
shall
pay
dearly
for
our
this
is
confoundedly
unlucky
replied
mcelvina
she
brings
the
wind
down
with
her
and
wo
part
with
a
breath
of
it
however
heart
never
won
fair
lady
keep
her
away
two
points
more
clap
everything
on
her
we
her
yet
the
breeze
that
ran
along
the
water
in
advance
of
the
frigate
now
began
to
be
felt
by
the
lugger
who
again
dashed
the
foaming
water
from
her
bows
as
she
darted
through
the
wave
but
it
was
a
point
of
sailing
at
which
a
frigate
has
always
an
advantage
over
a
small
vessel
and
mcelvina
having
gradually
edged
away
so
as
to
bring
the
three
masts
of
his
pursuer
apparently
into
one
perceived
that
the
frigate
was
rapidly
closing
with
him
the
crew
of
the
lugger
who
had
been
all
merriment
at
the
successful
termination
of
the
late
combat
for
not
one
man
had
been
killed
or
severely
wounded
now
paced
the
deck
or
looked
over
the
bulwark
with
serious
and
foreboding
aspects
the
foreigners
particularly
began
to
curse
their
fate
and
considered
their
voyage
and
anticipated
profits
at
an
end
mcelvina
perceiving
their
discontent
ordered
the
men
aft
and
addressed
them
my
lads
i
have
often
been
in
a
worse
scrape
and
have
weathered
it
nor
do
i
know
but
what
we
may
yet
manage
to
get
out
of
this
if
you
will
pay
strict
attention
to
my
orders
and
behave
in
that
cool
and
brave
manner
which
i
have
reason
to
expect
from
you
much
if
not
all
depends
upon
whether
the
captain
of
that
frigate
is
a
or
not
if
he
is
an
old
channel
groper
we
shall
have
some
difficulty
but
however
we
will
try
for
it
and
if
we
do
not
succeed
at
least
we
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
we
did
our
best
both
for
ourselves
and
our
employers
mcelvina
then
proceeded
to
explain
to
his
crew
the
manoeuvre
that
he
intended
to
practise
to
obtain
the
of
the
frigate
upon
which
their
only
chance
of
escape
would
depend
and
the
men
returned
to
their
stations
if
not
contented
at
least
with
increased
confidence
in
their
captain
and
strong
hopes
of
success
as
the
day
closed
the
frigate
was
within
a
mile
of
the
lugger
and
coming
up
with
him
hand
over
hand
the
breeze
was
strong
and
the
water
was
no
longer
in
ripples
but
curled
over
in
short
waves
to
the
influence
of
the
blast
the
frigate
yawed
a
little
the
smoke
from
her
was
followed
by
an
instantaneous
report
and
the
shot
dashed
into
the
water
close
under
the
stern
of
the
lugger
sit
down
under
the
bulwarks
sit
down
my
lads
and
keep
all
fast
said
mcelvina
soon
be
tired
of
that
he
has
lost
more
than
a
cable
length
already
mcelvina
was
correct
in
his
supposition
the
commander
of
the
frigate
perceived
that
he
had
lost
too
much
ground
by
deviating
from
his
course
and
the
evening
was
closing
in
he
fired
no
more
both
vessels
continued
their
course
the
smuggler
particularly
attentive
in
keeping
the
three
masts
of
her
pursuer
in
one
to
prevent
her
from
firing
into
her
or
to
oblige
her
to
drop
astern
if
she
did
half
an
hour
more
and
as
the
sun
lower
limb
touched
the
horizon
the
frigate
was
within
of
the
lugger
and
the
marines
who
had
been
ordered
forward
commenced
a
heavy
fire
upon
her
to
induce
her
to
lower
her
sails
and
surrender
but
in
vain
by
the
directions
of
their
captain
the
men
sheltered
themselves
under
the
bulwarks
and
the
vessel
continued
her
course
with
all
her
sails
expanded
to
the
breeze
a
few
minutes
more
and
she
was
right
under
the
bows
of
the
frigate
who
now
prepared
to
and
pour
a
broadside
into
her
for
her
temerity
mcelvina
watched
their
motions
attentively
and
as
the
frigate
with
all
her
sails
set
he
gave
the
order
to
lower
away
and
the
sails
of
the
lugger
were
in
an
instant
down
on
the
deck
in
token
of
submission

now

a
little
bit

the
mizen
up

they
wo
observe
it
marines
cease
shorten
sail
and
clear
away
the
first
cutter
were
the
orders
given
on
board
the
frigate
and
distinctly
heard
by
the
smugglers
but
the
heavy
press
of
sail
that
the
frigate
was
obliged
to
carry
to
come
up
with
the
chase
was
not
so
soon
to
be
reduced
as
that
of
a
small
vessel
and
as
she
with
below
and
aloft
she
shot
past
the
lugger
and
left
her
on
her
quarter
now
your
time
my
men
hoist
away
the
to
windward
the
lugger
payed
off
as
the
wind
caught
the
sail
all
right
up
with
the
lugs
the
order
was
obeyed
as
an
order
generally
is
by
men
working
for
their
escape
from
what
they
most
dreaded
poverty
and
imprisonment
and
before
the
frigate
could
reduce
her
sails
which
were
more
than
she
could
carry
on
a
wind
the
lugger
had
shot
away
on
her
weather
quarter
and
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
advance
the
frigate
tacked
after
her
firing
gun
after
gun
but
without
success
fortune
favoured
mcelvina
and
the
shades
of
night
soon
hid
the
lugger
from
the
sight
of
her
irritated
and
disappointed
pursuers
a
long
career
was
before

change
the
scene
to

of

of

and
corpulent

with

little
of
fashion
in
his
appearance
as

female
of
about
twenty
years
of

and
beautiful
features

wanting
the

on

true
value

so

appreciate

of

busy
examining
through

some
papers
which
lay
on
the
table
before
him
occasionally
diverted
from
his
task
by
the
pertinacity
of
some

which
seemed
to
have
taken
a
particular
fancy
to
his
bald
forehead

in

brushing

at
which

sat
and
added
to
the
general
air
of
confinement
which
pervaded
the
whole
it
very
hot
my
dear
open
the
window
and
let
us
have
a
little
air
oh
father
replied
the
young
woman
who
rose
to
throw
up
the
sash
you
do
know
how
i
pine
for
fresh
air
how
long
do
you
intend
to
continue
this
life
of
constant
toil
and
privation
how
long
my
dear
why
i
presume
you
do
not
wish
to
starve
you
would
not
be
very
well
pleased
if
when
you
applied
for
money
as
you
do
every
week
i
were
to
tell
you
that
the
bag
was
empty
oh
nonsense
i
know
better
father
do
think
so
poorly
of
me
as
to
attempt
to
deceive
me
in
that
way
and
pray
miss
susan
what
do
you
know
said
the
old
gentleman
looking
up
at
her
through
his
spectacles
as
she
stood
by
the
side
of
his
chair
i
know
what
you
have
taught
me
sir
do
you
recollect
explaining
to
me
the
nature
of
the
funds
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
national
debt
all
the
varieties
of
stock
and
what
interest
they
all
bore
well
and
what
then
why
then
father
i
have
often
seen
the
amounts
of
the
dividends
which
you
have
received
every
and
have
heard
your
orders
to
wilmott
to
in
the
funds
now
your
last
dividend
in
the
three
per
cents
was
let
me
see
oh
pounds
shillings
pence
which
you
know
doubled
makes
itself
an
income
of
and
pray
miss
susan
what
business
have
you
with
all
this
retorted
her
father
half
pleased
half
angry
why
father
you
taught
me
yourself
and
thought
me
very
stupid
because
i
did
not
comprehend
it
as
soon
as
you
expected
answered
susan
leaning
over
and
kissing
him
and
now
you
ask
me
what
business
i
have
to
know
it
well
well
girl
it
very
true
said
the
old
man
smiling
but
allowing
that
you
are
correct
what
then
why
then
father
do
be
angry
if
i
say
that
it
appears
to
me
that
you
have
more
money
now
than
you
can
spend
while
you
live
or
know
to
whom
to
leave
when
you
die
what
then
is
the
use
of
confining
yourself
in
a
dirty
narrow
street
and
toiling
all
day
for
no
earthly
advantage
but
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
nobody
to
leave
my
money
to
susan
have
you
not
repeatedly
said
that
you
have
no
relations
or
kin
that
you
are
aware
of
except
me
that
you
were
once
a
sailor
before
the
mast
an
orphan
bound
apprentice
by
the
parish
whom
then
have
you
except
and
if
you
continue
here
much
longer
father
i
feel
convinced
that
you
will
not
have
me
you
will
have
no
one
if
you
knew
how
tired
i
am
of
looking
out
at
this
horrid
brick
wall
how
i
long
for
the
country
to
be
running
among
the
violets
and
primroses
how
i
pine
for
relief
from
this
little
dungeon
oh
what
would
i
give
to
be
flying
before
the
breeze
in
the
lugger
with
mcelvina
indeed
miss
replied
old
hornblow
whom
the
reader
may
recognise
as
the
patron
of
our
smuggling
captain
well
father
there
no
harm
in
saying
so
i
want
freedom
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
be
too
free
i
should
like
to
be
blown
about
in
a
balloon
oh
why
do
you
give
up
business
go
down
to
the
take
a
pretty
little
cottage
and
make
yourself
and
me
happy
i
fancy
the
is
blowing
in
my
face
and
all
my
ringlets
out
of
curl
i
shall
die
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
i
shall
indeed
father
repeated
attacks
of
this
nature
had
already
sapped
the
foundation
and
a
lovely
and
only
daughter
had
the
influence
over
her
father
heart
to
which
she
was
entitled
well
well
susan
let
mcelvina
wind
up
the
accounts
of
this
vessel
and
then
i
will
do
as
you
wish
but
i
can
not
turn
him
adrift
you
know
turn
captain
mcelvina
adrift
no
if
you
did
father
i
presume
that
you
would
be
very
much
inclined
to
take
him
in
tow
eh
miss
i
shall
never
act
without
attending
to
your
advice
and
consulting
your
wishes
my
dear
father
answered
susan
the
suffusion
of
her
unusually
pale
cheeks
proving
that
she
required
but
colour
to
be
perfectly
beautiful
and
here
the
conversation
dropped
old
hornblow
had
long
perceived
the
growing
attachment
between
his
daughter
and
mcelvina
and
the
faithful
and
valuable
services
of
the
latter
added
to
the
high
opinion
which
the
old
man
had
of
his
honesty
which
to
do
mcelvina
justice
had
been
most
scrupulous
had
determined
him
to
let
things
take
their
own
course
indeed
there
was
no
one
with
whom
old
hornblow
was
acquainted
to
whom
he
would
have
entrusted
his
daughter
happiness
with
so
much
confidence
as
to
our
reformed
captain
a
sharp
double
tap
at
the
street
door
announced
the
post
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
conversation
the
clerk
appeared
with
a
letter
for
old
hornblow
who
pursuant
to
the
prudent
custom
of
those
days
had
his
on
the
ground
floor
of
his
own
residence
which
enabled
him
to
go
to
his
dinner
and
return
to
his
business
in
the
evening
nowadays
we
are
all
above
our
business
and
live
above
our
means
which
is
in
itself
sufficient
to
account
for
the
general
distress
that
is
complained
of
and
the
is
deserted
before
dusk
that
we
may
arrive
at
our
residences
in
or
the
in
time
to
dress
for
a
turtle
dinner
at
six
instead
of
a
mutton
chop
or
single
joint
at
two
but
to
return
old
hornblow
put
on
his
spectacles
which
were
on
the
table
since
they
had
been
removed
from
his
nose
by
susan
when
she
kissed
him
and
examined
the
seal
and
superscription
as
if
he
wished
to
tax
his
ingenuity
with
a
guess
previously
to
opening
the
letter
which
would
have
saved
him
all
that
trouble
and
have
decided
the
point
of
scrutiny
from
whom
it
came
mcelvina
i
rather
think
said
he
musing
but
the
postmark
is
plymouth
how
the
deuce
the
two
first
lines
of
the
letter
were
read
and
the
old
man
countenance
fell
susan
who
had
been
all
alive
at
the
mention
of
mcelvina
name
perceived
the
alteration
in
her
father
looks
no
bad
news
i
hope
my
dear
father
bad
enough
replied
the
old
man
with
a
deep
sigh
the
lugger
is
taken
by
a
frigate
and
sent
into
plymouth
and
captain
mcelvina
he
not
hurt
i
hope
no
i
presume
not
as
he
has
written
the
letter
and
says
nothing
about
it
satisfied
upon
this
point
susan
who
recollected
her
father
promise
was
undutiful
enough
we
are
sorry
to
say
to
allow
her
heart
to
bound
with
joy
at
the
circumstance
all
her
fond
hopes
were
about
to
be
realised
and
she
could
hardly
refrain
from
carolling
the
words
of
ariel
where
the
bee
sucks
there
lurk
i
but
fortunately
she
remembered
that
other
parties
might
not
exactly
participate
in
her
delight
out
of
respect
for
her
father
feelings
she
therefore
put
on
a
grave
countenance
in
sad
contrast
with
her
eyes
which
joy
had
brilliantly
lighted
up
well
it
a
bad
business
continued
old
hornblow
wilmott
the
clerk
heard
his
master
voice
and
came
in
bring
me
the
ledger
let
me
see
i
wonder
why
the
fool
called
her
by
that
name
as
if
i
had
not
one
already
to
take
money
out
of
my
pocket
oh
here
it
is
folio
continued
folio
not
balanced
since
april
last
year
be
quick
and
strike
me
out
a
rough
of
the
lugger
but
what
does
captain
mcelvina
say
father
what
does
he
say
why
that
he
is
taken
have
i
told
you
so
already
girl
replied
old
hornblow
in
evident
yes
but
the
particulars
my
dear
father
oh
there
only
the
fact
without
particulars
says
he
will
write
more
fully
in
a
day
or
two
i
answer
for
him
that
it
was
not
his
fault
father
he
has
always
done
you
justice
i
did
not
say
that
he
had
not
i
only
afraid
that
success
has
made
him
careless
it
always
the
case
yes
replied
susan
taking
up
the
right
cue
as
you
say
father
he
has
been
very
successful
he
has
replied
the
old
man
recovering
his
serenity
a
little
very
successful
indeed
i
dare
say
it
was
not
his
fault
the
clerk
soon
made
his
appearance
with
the
rough
required
it
did
more
to
restore
the
good
humour
of
the
old
man
than
even
the
soothing
of
his
daughter
oh
here
we
are
belle
debtor
to
total
pounds
shillings
pence
contra
credit
pounds
shillings
pence
balance
to
profit
and
loss
pounds
shillings
pence
well
that
not
so
very
bad
in
less
than
three
years
i
think
i
may
afford
to
lose
her
why
father
replied
susan
leaning
over
his
shoulder
and
looking
archly
at
him
is
a
fortune
in
itself
to
a
contented
person
but
as
independently
of
mcelvina
letter
not
being
sufficiently
explicit
there
are
other
circumstances
connected
with
his
capture
that
are
important
to
our
history
we
shall
ourselves
narrate
the
particulars
for
more
than
two
years
mcelvina
by
his
dexterity
and
courage
and
the
fast
sailing
of
his
vessel
had
escaped
all
his
pursuers
and
regularly
landed
his
cargoes
during
this
time
willy
had
made
rapid
progress
under
his
instruction
not
only
in
his
general
education
but
also
in
that
of
his
profession
one
morning
the
lugger
was
off
cape
clear
on
the
coast
of
ireland
when
she
discovered
a
frigate
to
windward
the
wind
weather
and
relative
situations
of
the
two
vessels
being
much
the
same
as
on
the
former
occasion
when
mcelvina
by
his
daring
and
judicious
manoeuvre
had
effected
his
escape
the
frigate
chased
and
soon
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
lugger
when
she
and
poured
in
a
broadside
of
grape
which
brought
her
down
on
deck
from
that
moment
such
an
incessant
fire
of
musketry
was
poured
in
from
the
frigate
that
every
man
on
board
of
mcelvina
vessel
who
endeavoured
to
repair
the
mischief
was
immediately
struck
down
any
attempt
at
escape
was
now
hopeless
when
within
two
cables
length
the
frigate
hove
to
the
wind
keeping
the
lugger
under
her
lee
and
continued
a
fire
of
grape
and
musketry
into
her
until
the
rest
of
her
sails
were
lowered
down
the
crew
of
the
smuggler
perceiving
all
chance
in
their
favour
to
be
over
ran
down
below
to
avoid
the
fire
and
secure
their
own
effects
the
boats
of
the
frigate
were
soon
on
board
of
the
lugger
and
despatched
back
to
her
with
mcelvina
and
the
chief
officers
willy
jumped
into
the
boat
and
was
taken
on
board
with
his
patron
the
captain
of
the
frigate
was
on
the
and
as
he
turned
round
it
occurred
to
willy
that
he
had
seen
his
face
before
but
when
or
where
he
could
not
exactly
call
to
mind
and
he
continued
to
scrutinise
him
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
revolving
in
his
mind
where
it
was
that
he
had
encountered
that
peculiar
countenance
his
eye
so
fixed
upon
the
captain
that
it
followed
him
up
and
down
as
he
moved
at
last
was
met
by
that
of
the
latter
who
surprised
at
finding
so
small
a
lad
among
the
prisoners
walked
over
to
the
of
the
and
addressed
him
with
you
but
a
young
smuggler
my
lad
are
you
the
captain
son
the
voice
immediately
recalled
to
willy
recollection
every
circumstance
attending
their
last
meeting
and
who
the
captain
was
he
answered
in
the
negative
with
a
smile
you
a
light
heart
youngster
pray
what
your
name
said
that
my
name
was
to
be
seymour
sir
replied
willy
touching
his
hat
said
his
name
was
to
be
seymour
what
does
the
boy
mean
good
heavens
i
recollect
observed
captain
m
for
it
was
he
are
you
the
boy
that
i
sent
home
in
the
to
be
fitted
out
for
the
yes
sir
and
how
long
have
you
been
on
this
praiseworthy
service
ever
since
sir
replied
our
hero
who
had
little
idea
of
its
impropriety
belle
was
as
renowned
for
her
fast
sailing
and
repeated
escapes
from
the
cruisers
as
captain
mcelvina
and
his
crew
were
for
their
courage
and
success
the
capture
of
the
vessel
had
long
been
a
desideratum
of
the
english
government
and
captain
m
although
gratified
at
her
falling
into
his
hands
was
not
very
well
pleased
to
find
that
a
lad
whom
he
had
intended
to
bring
forward
in
the
service
should
as
he
supposed
have
voluntarily
joined
a
party
who
had
so
long
bid
defiance
to
the
laws
and
naval
force
of
the
country
his
countenance
assumed
an
air
of
displeasure
and
he
was
about
to
turn
away
without
any
further
remarks
when
mcelvina
who
perceived
how
matters
stood
and
felt
aware
that
willy
future
prospects
were
at
stake
stepped
forward
and
respectfully
addressing
the
captain
narrated
in
few
words
the
rescue
of
willy
from
the
wreck
and
added
that
the
boy
had
been
detained
by
him
and
had
had
no
opportunity
of
leaving
the
vessel
which
had
never
anchored
but
in
the
french
port
of
havre
he
also
stated
what
was
indeed
true
that
he
had
always
evaded
explaining
to
the
boy
the
real
nature
of
the
service
upon
which
the
lugger
was
employed
from
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
notwithstanding
mcelvina
defence
of
smuggling
in
our
former
chapters
he
was
not
quite
so
well
convinced
in
his
own
mind
of
its
propriety
as
he
would
have
induced
debriseau
to
suppose
the
assertions
of
mcelvina
turned
the
scale
again
in
willy
favour
and
after
he
had
answered
the
interrogatories
of
the
captain
relative
to
the
fate
of
mr
bullock
and
the
rest
of
the
men
in
the
prize
captain
m
who
although
severe
was
not
only
just
but
determined
that
his
former
good
intentions
relative
to
our
hero
should
still
remain
in
force
well
mr
seymour
you
have
seen
a
little
service
and
your
captain
gives
you
a
high
character
as
an
active
and
clever
lad
as
you
have
been
detained
against
your
will
i
think
we
may
recover
your
time
and
pay
i
trust
however
that
you
will
in
future
be
employed
in
a
more
honourable
manner
we
shall
in
all
probability
be
soon
in
port
and
till
then
you
must
remain
as
you
are
for
i
can
not
trust
you
again
in
a
prize
as
our
hero
was
in
a
new
ship
the
officers
and
ship
company
of
which
were
not
acquainted
with
his
history
except
that
he
had
been
promoted
for
an
act
of
gallantry
by
captain
m
he
was
favourably
received
by
his
messmates
the
crew
of
the
lugger
were
detained
as
prisoners
on
board
of
the
frigate
and
the
vessel
in
charge
of
one
of
the
officers
was
ordered
to
keep
company
captain
m
having
determined
to
return
into
port
and
not
wishing
to
lose
sight
of
his
valuable
prize
you
have
a
very
fine
ship
company
captain
mcelvina
observed
captain
m
how
many
of
them
are
english
about
eighty
and
as
good
seamen
as
ever
walked
a
plank
captain
m
ordered
the
crew
of
the
lugger
aft
of
the
and
put
the
question
to
them
whether
they
would
not
prefer
entering
his
majesty
service
to
the
confinement
of
a
prison
but
at
the
moment
they
felt
too
indignant
at
having
been
captured
by
the
frigate
to
listen
to
the
proposal
and
refused
to
a
man
captain
m
turned
away
disappointed
surveying
the
fine
body
of
men
with
a
covetous
eye
as
they
were
ranged
in
a
line
on
his
he
felt
what
a
prize
they
would
be
to
him
if
he
could
have
added
them
to
his
own
company
for
at
that
time
it
was
almost
impossible
to
man
the
number
of
ships
which
were
employed
in
an
effective
manner
will
you
allow
me
to
try
what
i
can
do
for
you
sir
said
mcelvina
as
the
men
disappeared
from
the
to
their
former
station
as
prisoners
having
received
the
nod
of
assent
on
the
part
of
captain
m
mcelvina
went
down
to
the
men
who
gathered
round
him
he
forcibly
pointed
out
to
them
the
advantages
of
the
proposal
and
the
good
chance
they
had
of
enriching
themselves
by
the
they
would
make
in
a
frigate
which
could
capture
such
a
vessel
as
the
lugger
he
also
dwelt
upon
the
misery
of
the
prison
which
awaited
them
but
what
decided
them
was
the
observation
that
in
all
probability
they
would
not
be
permitted
now
that
seamen
were
in
such
request
to
remain
in
prison
but
would
be
drafted
in
several
ships
and
be
separated
whereas
by
now
entering
for
captain
m
they
would
all
remain
shipmates
as
before
having
obtained
their
unanimous
consent
mcelvina
with
a
pleased
countenance
came
aft
followed
by
his
men
and
informed
captain
m
that
they
had
agreed
to
enter
for
his
ship
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
sir
on
your
good
fortune
as
you
will
yourself
acknowledge
it
to
be
when
you
find
out
what
an
addition
they
will
be
to
your
ship
company
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
your
interference
sir
replied
captain
m
and
shall
not
prove
ungrateful
your
conduct
in
this
affair
makes
me
inclined
to
ask
another
favour
i
believe
you
can
give
me
some
valuable
information
if
you
choose
whether
you
are
inclined
to
do
so
i
am
not
yet
sure
but
i
now
think
that
you
will
you
will
find
me
an
englishman
body
and
soul
sir
and
although
i
have
in
defence
of
my
profession
been
occasionally
necessitated
to
choose
between
capture
and
resistance
i
can
most
conscientiously
say
that
every
shot
i
have
fired
against
my
own
countrymen
has
smitten
me
to
the
heart
and
this
assertion
was
true
although
we
have
no
time
to
analyse
mcelvina
feelings
at
present
i
am
not
bound
by
honour
nor
have
i
the
least
inclination
to
conceal
any
information
i
may
have
obtained
when
in
the
french
ports
i
went
there
to
serve
my
purposes
and
they
allowed
me
to
do
so
to
serve
their
own
i
never
would
although
repeatedly
offered
bribes
bring
them
any
information
relative
to
the
proceedings
of
our
own
country
and
i
shall
most
cheerfully
answer
your
questions
indeed
i
have
information
which
i
would
have
given
you
before
now
had
i
not
felt
that
it
might
be
supposed
i
was
actuated
more
by
a
view
of
serving
myself
than
my
country
i
only
wish
captain
m
that
you
may
fall
in
with
a
french
frigate
before
i
leave
your
ship
that
i
may
prove
to
you
that
i
can
fight
as
well
for
old
england
as
i
have
done
in
defence
of
property
entrusted
to
my
charge
then
do
me
the
favour
to
step
down

captain

shut
up

time

the
information
received
by

so
important
that
he
determined
not
to
anchor
he
put
all
the
french

on

i
must
not
look
to
have
shakespeare
but
we
must
return
on
shore
that
we
may
not
lose
sight
of
the
grandfather
of
our
hero
who
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
being
in
existence
who
was
so
nearly
connected
with
him
the
time
had
come
when
that
information
was
to
be
given
for
about
six
weeks
previous
to
the
action
we
have
described
in
which
adams
the
was
killed
admiral
de
courcy
was
attacked
by
a
painful
and
mortal
disease
as
long
as
he
was
able
to
move
about
his
irritability
of
temper
increased
by
suffering
rendered
him
more
insupportable
than
ever
but
he
was
soon
confined
to
his
room
and
the
progress
of
the
disease
became
so
rapid
that
the
medical
attendants
considered
it
their
duty
to
apprise
him
that
all
hopes
of
recovery
must
now
be
abandoned
and
that
he
must
prepare
himself
for
the
worst
the
admiral
received
the
intelligence
with
apparent
composure
and
bowed
his
head
to
the
physicians
as
they
quitted
his
room
he
was
alone
and
left
to
his
own
reflections
which
were
not
of
the
most
enviable
nature
he
was
seated
propped
up
in
an
easy
chair
opposite
the
large
french
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
park
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
shadows
of
the
magnificent
trees
which
adorned
his
extensive
domain
were
in
beautiful
contrast
with
the
gleams
of
radiant
light
darting
in
long
streaks
between
them
on
the
luxuriant
herbage
the
cattle
quietly
standing
in
the
lake
were
refreshing
themselves
after
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
deer
lay
in
groups
under
the
shade
or
crouching
in
their
lairs
partly
concealed
by
the
underwood
and
fern
all
was
in
repose
and
beauty
and
the
dying
man
watched
the
sun
as
it
fast
descended
to
the
horizon
as
emblematical
of
his
race
so
shortly
to
be
sped
he
surveyed
the
groups
before
him
he
envied
even
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
reclaimed
tenants
of
the
forest
for
they
at
least
had
of
their
kind
with
whom
they
could
associate
but
he
their
lord
and
master
was
alone
alone
in
the
world
without
one
who
loved
or
cared
for
him
without
one
to
sympathise
in
his
sufferings
and
administer
to
his
wants
except
from
interested
motives
without
one
to
soothe
his
anguish
and
soften
the
pillow
of
affliction
and
disease
without
one
to
close
his
eyes
or
shed
a
tear
now
that
he
was
dying
his
thoughts
naturally
reverted
to
his
wife
and
children
he
knew
that
two
of
these
individuals
out
of
three
were
in
the
cold
grave
and
where
was
the
other
the
certain
approach
of
death
had
already
humanised
and
softened
his
flinty
heart
the
veil
that
had
been
drawn
by
passion
between
his
conscience
and
his
guilt
was
torn
away
the
past
rushed
upon
his
memory
with
dreadful
rapidity
and
truth
and
horrible
conviction
flashed
upon
his
soul
as
he
unwillingly
acknowledged
himself
to
be
the
murderer
of
his
wife
and
child
remorse
as
usual
followed
treading
upon
the
heels
of
conviction
such
remorse
that
in
a
short
space
the
agony
became
insupportable
after
an
ineffectual
struggle
of
pride
he
seized
the
line
which
was
attached
to
the
and
when
his
summons
was
obeyed
desired
that
the
vicar
might
be
immediately
requested
to
come
to
him
acquainted
with
the
admiral
situation
the
vicar
had
anxiously
waited
the
summons
which
he
was
but
too
well
aware
would
come
for
he
knew
the
human
heart
and
the
cry
for
aid
which
the
sinner
in
his
fear
sends
forth
he
was
soon
in
the
presence
of
the
admiral
for
the
first
time
since
the
day
that
he
quitted
the
house
with
the
letter
of
the
unfortunate
peters
in
his
possession
the
conversation
which
ensued
between
the
agitated
man
who
had
existed
only
for
this
world
and
the
placid
teacher
who
had
considered
it
as
he
inculcated
as
only
a
preparation
for
a
better
was
too
long
to
be
here
inserted
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
the
humbled
and
terrified
wretch
the
sufferer
from
disease
and
greater
sufferer
from
remorse
never
could
have
been
identified
with
the
once
proud
and
mortal
who
had
so
long
spurned
at
the
precepts
of
religion
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
mild
persuasions
of
its
apostle
but
that
letter
continued
the
admiral
in
a
faltering
voice
what
was
it
i
have
yet
one
child
alive
oh
send
immediately
for
him
and
let
me
implore
his
forgiveness
for
my
cruelty
that
letter
sir
was
written
but
one
hour
previously
to
his
death
his
death
cried
the
admiral
turning
his
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
god
have
mercy
on
me
then
i
have
murdered
him
also
and
how
did
he
die
did
he
starve
as
i
expressed
in
my
horrid
horrid
wish
no
sir
his
life
was
forfeited
to
the
offended
laws
of
his
country
good
god
sir
hastily
replied
the
admiral
whose
ruling
passion
pride
returned
for
the
moment
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
was
hanged
even
so
but
here
is
the
letter
which
he
wrote
read
it
the
admiral
seized
the
letter
in
his
tremulous
hand
and
devoured
every
word
as
he
perused
it
he
let
it
fall
on
his
knees
and
said
in
a
subdued
voice
my
god
my
god
and
he
asked
forgiveness
and
forgives
me
then
with
frantic
exclamation
he
continued
wretch
that
i
am
would
that
i
had
died
for
thee
my
son
my
son
and
clasping
his
hands
over
his
head
he
fell
back
in
a
state
of
insensibility
the
vicar
much
affected
with
the
scene
rang
the
bell
for
assistance
which
was
obtained
but
the
wretched
man
had
received
a
shock
which
hastened
his
dissolution
he
was
too
much
exhausted
to
sit
upright
and
they
were
obliged
to
carry
him
to
the
bed
from
which
he
never
rose
again
as
soon
as
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
able
to
converse
he
waved
the
servants
from
the
room
and
resumed
in
a
faltering
voice
but
sir
he
mentions
his
child
my
grandchild
where
is
he
can
i
see
him
i
am
afraid
not
sir
replied
the
vicar
who
then
entered
into
a
recital
of
the
arrangements
which
had
taken
place
and
the
name
of
the
ship
on
board
of
which
our
hero
had
been
permitted
to
remain
under
the
charge
of
adams
the
quartermaster
the
admiral
listened
to
the
recital
of
the
vicar
without
interruption
and
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
to
the
great
joy
of
the
worthy
pastor
expressed
the
most
anxious
wish
to
make
every
reparation
in
his
power
aware
that
difficulties
might
arise
from
the
circumstance
of
our
existence
not
being
suspected
by
his
collateral
heirs
who
had
for
some
time
considered
as
certain
their
ultimate
possession
of
his
large
entailed
property
he
directed
a
will
to
be
immediately
drawn
up
acknowledging
his
grandchild
and
leaving
to
him
all
his
personal
property
which
was
very
considerable
and
praying
the
vicar
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
guardian
to
the
boy
a
request
which
was
cheerfully
complied
with
the
admiral
would
not
listen
to
the
repeated
requests
of
the
vicar
to
take
the
repose
which
his
excited
and
sinking
frame
required
until
the
necessary
document
had
been
drawn
out
signed
and
duly
witnessed
when
all
was
complete
he
fell
back
on
the
pillow
in
such
a
state
of
exhaustion
as
threatened
immediately
to
terminate
his
career
it
was
late
when
the
vicar
took
his
leave
after
having
administered
some
little
consolation
to
the
repentant
and
dying
man
and
promised
to
call
upon
him
early
on
the
ensuing
morning
but
the
vicar
had
other
duties
to
perform
which
induced
him
to
defer
his
visit
until
the
following
noon
others
were
sick
others
were
dying
and
needed
spiritual
consolation
and
he
made
no
distinction
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
physicians
had
expressed
their
opinion
that
the
admiral
might
linger
for
many
days
and
the
vicar
thought
that
advantage
might
be
derived
from
his
being
left
for
a
short
time
to
his
own
reflections
and
to
recover
from
the
state
of
exhaustion
arising
from
the
communications
of
the
preceding
evening
when
he
arrived
at
the
hall
the
windows
were
closed
admiral
de
courcy
was
no
more
reader
you
shall
hear
how
he
died
it
was
about
two
in
the
morning
that
he
awoke
from
an
uneasy
slumber
and
felt
his
end
approaching
the
old
crone
who
had
been
hired
as
a
nurse
to
watch
at
night
was
fast
asleep
in
her
chair
the
rushlight
had
burned
low
down
in
the
socket
and
through
the
interstices
of
its
pierced
shade
threw
a
feeble
and
alternate
light
and
shadow
over
the
room
the
mouth
of
the
dying
man
was
glued
together
from
internal
heat
and
he
suffered
from
agonising
thirst
he
murmured
for
relief
but
no
one
answered
again
and
again
he
attempted
to
make
his
careless
attendant
acquainted
with
his
wants
but
in
vain
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
moved
the
curtains
of
the
bed
that
the
noise
of
the
upon
the
iron
rods
might
have
the
effect
and
then
fell
back
with
exhaustion
arising
from
the
effort
which
he
had
made
the
old
beldame
who
for
money
was
willing
to
undertake
the
most
revolting
offices
and
who
without
remuneration
was
so
hardened
by
her
constant
familiarity
with
disease
and
death
that
she
was
callous
and
insensible
to
the
most
earnest
supplication
woke
up
at
the
noise
which
the
had
made
and
opened
the
curtain
to
ascertain
what
was
required
long
experience
told
her
at
once
that
all
would
soon
be
over
and
she
was
convinced
that
her
charge
would
never
rise
or
speak
again
this
was
true
but
the
suffering
man
his
arm
lying
outside
of
the
bedclothes
and
his
elbow
bent
upwards
still
pointed
with
his
finger
to
his
parched
mouth
with
a
look
of
entreaty
from
his
sinking
eyes
the
old
fiend
shut
the
curtains
and
the
admiral
waited
with
impatience
for
them
to
reopen
with
the
drop
of
water
to
cool
his
parched
tongue
but
in
vain
leaving
him
to
his
fate
she
hobbled
about
the
room
to
secure
a
golden
harvest
before
others
should
make
their
appearance
and
share
it
with
her
his
purse
was
on
the
table
she
removed
the
gold
which
it
contained
and
left
the
silver
she
chose
that
which
she
imagined
to
be
the
most
valuable
of
the
three
rings
on
the
dressing
table
she
detached
one
seal
from
the
chain
of
his
watch
she
then
repaired
to
the
wardrobe
and
examined
its
contents
one
of
her
capacious
pockets
was
soon
filled
with
the
finest
cambric
handkerchiefs
all
of
which
she
first
took
the
precaution
to
open
and
hold
up
to
the
light
rejecting
those
which
were
not
of
the
finest
texture
the
silk
stockings
were
the
next
articles
that
were
coveted
they
were
unfolded
one
by
one
and
her
skinny
arm
passed
up
that
the
feet
might
be
extended
by
her
shrivelled
hands
to
ascertain
whether
they
were
darned
or
not
if
so
they
were
rejected
the
wardrobe
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
and
on
that
side
the
curtains
had
not
been
closed
the
dying
man
had
still
enough
sight
left
to
perceive
the
employment
of
his
attendant
what
must
have
been
his
feelings
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
which
startled
the
old
hag
and
she
repaired
to
the
bedside
to
examine
the
state
of
her
charge
again
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
his
mouth
and
again
she
returned
to
her
employment
without
having
rendered
the
assistance
which
he
required
his
eyes
followed
and
his
finger
still
pointed
having
ransacked
every
drawer
and
secured
all
that
she
dared
take
or
that
her
pockets
could
contain
she
rang
the
bell
for
the
servants
of
the
house
then
pulling
out
her
handkerchief
ready
to
put
to
her
eyes
in
token
of
sympathy
she
sat
down
on
her
easy
chair
to
await
their
coming
in
the
meanwhile
the
eyes
of
the
unfortunate
man
gradually
turned
upward
his
vision
was
gone
but
his
agonising
thirst
continued
to
the
last
and
when
the
retainers
of
the
family
came
in
he
was
found
dead
with
his
finger
still
pointing
in
the
same
direction
with
ordinary
minds
there
is
something
so
terrible
in
death
something
so
awful
in
the
dissolution
of
the
elements
of
our
frame
something
so
horrible
in
the
leap
into
the
dark
abyss
that
it
requires
all
the
powers
of
a
fortified
spirit
all
the
encouragement
of
a
good
conscience
and
all
the
consolations
of
religion
and
of
faith
to
enable
us
to
muster
any
degree
of
resolution
for
the
awful
change
but
if
aught
can
smooth
the
pillow
can
chase
away
from
the
terrified
spirit
the
doubt
and
depression
by
which
it
is
overwhelmed
it
is
the
being
surrounded
and
attended
by
those
who
are
devoted
and
endeared
to
us
when
love
and
duty
and
charity
and
sympathy
hover
round
the
couch
of
the
departing
fainting
hope
is
supported
by
their
presence
and
the
fleeting
spirit
directed
by
them
looks
upward
to
the
realms
from
which
these
passions
have
been
permitted
to
descend
on
earth
to
cheer
us
through
our
weary
pilgrimage
what
then
had
admiral
de
courcy
to
support
him
in
his
last
moments
a
good
conscience
faith
hope
love
duty
or
even
sympathy
wanting
all
he
breathed
his
last
but
let
us
forbear
to
judge
for
we
are
sinners
all
close
up
his
eyes
and
draw
the
curtains
close
and
let
us
all
to
meditation
the
vicar
affixed
seals
upon
the
drawers
to
secure
the
remainder
of
the
property
for
the
example
of
the
old
nurse
had
been
followed
by
many
others
and
having
given
directions
for
the
funeral
returned
to
his
own
home
the
second
day
after
the
admiral
death
a
carriage
and
four
drove
furiously
up
the
avenue
and
stopped
at
the
entrance
door
the
occupants
descended
and
rang
the
bells
with
an
air
of
authority
the
summons
was
answered
by
several
of
the
male
domestics
who
were
anxiously
looking
out
for
the
new
proprietor
of
the
domain
a
tall
man
of
very
gentlemanlike
appearance
followed
by
a
personage
in
black
walked
in
the
latter
as
he
followed
proclaiming
the
other
to
the
servants
as
the
and
present
owner
of
the
property
by
this
time
the
whole
household
were
assembled
lining
the
hall
for
the
visitors
to
pass
and
bowing
and
curtseying
to
the
ground
the
vicar
who
had
expected
the
appearance
of
these
parties
had
left
directions
that
he
might
be
immediately
acquainted
with
their
arrival
on
receipt
of
the
information
he
proceeded
to
the
hall
and
was
ushered
into
the
library
where
he
found
them
anxiously
awaiting
his
arrival
that
the
seals
might
be
withdrawn
which
had
been
placed
upon
the
drawers
whom
have
i
the
honour
of
addressing
sir
said
the
vicar
to
the
taller
of
the
two
whom
he
presumed
by
his
appearance
to
be
the
superior
sir
replied
the
little
man
in
a
pompous
manner
you
are
speaking
to
mr
rainscourt
the
of
this
entailed
property
i
am
sorry
truly
sorry
sir
replied
the
vicar
that
from
not
having
been
well
informed
you
should
be
subjected
to
such
severe
disappointment
i
am
afraid
sir
that
the
grandchild
of
admiral
de
courcy
will
have
a
prior
claim
the
two
parties
started
from
their
chairs
and
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
the
grandchild
replied
the
little
man
never
even
heard
that
there
was
such
a
person
very
probably
sir
but
i
have
long
known
it
and
so
did
admiral
de
courcy
as
you
will
perceive
when
you
read
his
will
which
is
in
my
possession
as
guardian
to
the
child
and
upon
the
strength
of
which
office
i
have
put
seals
upon
the
property
the
parties
looked
aghast
we
must
inquire
into
this
replied
the
legal
adviser
for
such
he
was
i
am
ready
to
give
you
any
information
you
may
require
replied
the
vicar
i
have
here
copies
of
the
marriage
certificate
of
the
parents
and
the
register
of
baptism
of
the
child
the
originals
of
which
you
will
find
in
the
parish
church
of
not
five
miles
distant
and
i
can
most
satisfactorily
prove
his
identity
should
that
be
necessary
and
where
is
the
grandchild
at
sea
on
board
a
at
the
dying
request
of
his
father
who
determined
that
he
should
be
brought
up
for
the
service
would
you
like
to
see
the
late
admiral
will
the
tall
gentleman
bowed
assent
and
it
was
read
having
been
carefully
examined
by
the
lawyer
as
well
as
the
other
documents
in
the
possession
all
appeared
so
clear
and
conclusive
that
he
unwillingly
acknowledged
to
his
employer
in
a
whisper
that
there
was
no
chance
of
setting
the
will
aside
pallid
with
the
revulsion
of
feelings
from
hope
to
despair
the
pretender
to
the
estates
ordered
the
horses
to
be
brought
out
and
on
their
being
announced
with
a
slight
bow
to
the
vicar
retired
from
the
library
but
outside
the
state
of
affairs
was
altered
by
the
servants
having
overheard
the
conversation
no
one
was
attentive
enough
to
open
the
door
to
let
out
those
whom
they
had
so
obsequiously
admitted
and
one
of
the
postilions
was
obliged
to
dismount
to
shut
up
the
chaise
after
they
had
entered
it

is
the
deference
shown
respectively

the
information
received
from
mcelvina
which
induced
captain
m
not
to
anchor
was
relative
to
a
french
frigate
of
the
largest
class
that
he
had
great
hopes
of
falling
in
with
she
was
lying
in
the
harbour
of
brest
waiting
for
a
detachment
of
troops
which
had
been
ordered
to
embark
when
she
was
to
sail
for
rochefort
to
join
a
squadron
intended
to
make
a
descent
upon
some
of
our
colonies
previously
to
sailing
from
the
port
of
havre
the
prefect
of
that
arrondissement
had
issued
directions
for
certain
detachments
to
march
on
a
stated
day
to
complete
the
number
of
troops
ordered
on
board
mcelvina
had
sure
data
from
which
to
calculate
as
to
the
exact
period
of
embarkation
and
was
also
aware
that
the
frigate
had
orders
to
sail
to
the
port
of
rendezvous
the
first
favourable
wind
after
the
embarkation
had
taken
place
in
two
days

that
was
the
name
of
the
frigate
commanded
by
captain

off

and
the
captain
taking
the
precaution
to
keep
well
off
the
land
during
the
only
running
in
to
make
the
lights
after
dark
retained
his
position
off
that
island
until
the
wind
shifted
to
the
northward
he
then
shaped
a
course
so
as
to
fall
in
with
the
french
coast
about
thirty
miles
to
the
southward
of
the
harbour
of
brest
it
was
still
dark
when
captain
m
having
run
his
distance
shortened
sail
and
in
the
cruising
ground
which
mcelvina
had
recommended
and
so
correct
was
the
calculation
as
well
as
the
information
of
the
captain
of
the
smugglers
that
at
as
the
frigate
lay
with
her
head
with
the
wind
at
a
large
vessel
was
descried
under
the
land
a
little
on
her
after
severely
scrutinising
the
stranger
for
some
minutes
with
his
glass
which
he
now
handed
to
mcelvina
that
she
indeed
i
believe
said
captain

a
large
frigate
with
set
standing
across
our
bows

we
must
cut
her
off
if
we
can

the
hands
were
summoned
up
by
the
shrill
pipe
of
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
but
it
was
quite
unnecessary
as
the
men
had
already
crowded
on
deck
upon
the
first
report
which
had
been
communicated
below
and
were
in
clusters
on
the
forecastle
and
gangways
topmen

loose
sails

away

hardly
out

breathless
with
his
rapid
descent
from
aloft
when
the
gaskets
were
off
and
the
sails
hung
fluttering
from
the
yards
in
another
minute
the
sheets
were
home
the
sails
hoisted
and
trimmed
and
the
darted
through
the
yielding
waves
as
if
the
eagerness
of
pursuit
which
quickened
the
pulses
of
her
crew
had
been
communicated
from
them
like
an
electric
shock
to
her
own
frame
and
she
were
conscious
that
her
country
demanded
her
best

point
they
neared
each
other
fast
the
french
vessel
with
his
starboard
running
for
the
entrance
of
the
narrow
passage
which
he
hoped
to
gain
and
the
to
intercept
him
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
the
dangerous
rocks

leeward

extending
from
saint

name
they

the

for
serving
out
but
they
started
it
all
in
the
they
wanted
the
tub
to
fill
it
with
shot
captain
m
smiled
at
the
enthusiasm
of
his
crew
but
the
smile
was
suddenly
checked
as
he
reflected
that
probably
many
of
the
fine
fellows
would
never
breakfast
again
if
not
contrary
to
your
regulations
captain
m
said
mcelvina
as
the
crew
of
the
have
not
yet
been
incorporated
with
your
ship
company
may
i
request
that
they
may
be
stationed
together
and
that
i
may
be
permitted
to
be
with
them
your
suggestion
is
good
replied
the
captain
and
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
the
offer
they
shall
assist
to
work
the
carronades
and
act
as
boarders
and
sail
trimmers
mr
hardy
let
the
new
men
be
provided
with
cutlasses
and
fill
up
any
vacancies
in
the
quarters
from
some
of
our
own
men
who
are
at
present
stationed
at
the
guns
the
frigates
were
now
within
gunshot
of
each
other
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
which
vessel
would
first
attain
the
desired
goal
the
foremost
guns
of
the
respective
ships
which
had
been
trained
forward
were
reported
to
bear
upon
the
enemy
and
both
commanders
were
aware
that
knocking
away
a
stick
the
shots
striking
the
masts
or
yards
of
her
opponent
so
as
to
occasion
them
to
fall
would
decide
the
point
at
the
very
time
that
captain
m
was
giving
directions
to
fire
the
guns
as
they
would
bear
the
first
shot
from
his
antagonist
whizzed
over
his
head
and
the
action
commenced
each
party
attempting
to
cripple
his
opponent
by
firing
high
at
his
masts
and
rigging
the
frigates
continued
to
engage
until
they
had
within
half
a
mile
of
each
other
when
the
of
the
frenchman
fell
over
the
side
this
decided
the
point
as
to
his
escape
through
the
passage
which
he
had
made
his
utmost
exertions
to
effect
in
pursuance
of
the
peremptory
orders
which
he
had
received
he
now
hauled
his
wind
on
the
same
tack
as
the
pouring
in
his
starboard
broadside
as
he
the
manoeuvre
was
good
as
he
thereby
retained
his
and
the
wreck
of
his
having
fallen
over
his
larboard
side
he
had
his
starboard
broadside
which
was
all
clear
and
directed
towards
his
opponent
moreover
he
forced
the
to
follow
him
into
the
bay
formed
between
the
bec
du
raz
and
the
bec
du
chevre
where
she
would
in
all
probability
receive
considerable
damage
from
the
batteries
which
lined
the
coast
captain
m
was
aware
of
all
this
but
his
only
fear
was
that
his
enemy
should
run
on
shore
and
prevent
his
carrying
him
into
port
the
was
soon
abreast
of
her
opponent
and
their
broadsides
were
exchanged
when
captain
m
who
wished
to
bring
the
action
to
a
speedy
conclusion
shot
his
vessel
ahead
which
he
was
enabled
to
do
from
his
superiority
of
sailing
after
the
of
the
french
frigate
had
been
shot
away
it
was
his
intention
not
to
have
tacked
until
he
could
have
fetched
his
antagonist
but
the
galling
fire
of
the
batteries
which
now
hulled
him
every
time
induced
him
to
go
about
and
as
he
was
in
stays
a
raking
shot
entered
the
cabin
windows
and
in
its
passage
along
the
added
ten
men
to
his
list
of
killed
and
wounded
again
the
frigates
on
opposite
tacks
poured
in
their
broadsides
the
of
the
frenchman
was
divided
in
the
slings
and
fell

and

shot
through
and
her
starboard
anchor
cut
from
her
bows
fell
under
her
bottom
and
tore
away
the
cable
a
short
range
of
which
captain
m
had
had
the
precaution
to
have
on
deck
as
they
fought
so
close
in
shore
this
threw
the
men
at
the
guns
into
confusion
and
brought
the
ship
up
in
the
wind
the
cable
was
at
last
separated
and
flew
out
of
the
after
the
anchor
which
plunged
to
the
bottom
but
this
was
not
effected
until
like
an
enormous
serpent
it
had
enfolded
in
its
embraces
three
or
four
hapless
men
who
were
carried
with
dreadful
velocity
to
the
where
their
crushed
bodies
for
a
time
stopped
it
from
running
out
and
gave
their
shipmates
an
opportunity
of
dividing
it
with
their
axes
order

eventually
restored
and
the
who
had
been
raked
by
her
active
opponent
during
the
time
that
she
was
thrown
up
in
the
wind
continued
her
course
and
as
she
passed
the
stern
of
the
french
frigate
luffed
up
and
returned
the
compliment
the
latter

in
his
crippled
state
for

support
of

already
seriously
injured

situation
to

whether

in
a
and
destructive
broadside

it

being
now
within
the
troops
who
were
so
thick
on

as
to
impede
the
motions
of

up

incessant
fire
of
musketry

the
two

over
opposite
ways
from
the
violent
concussion
of
the
air
in
the
confined
space
between
them
while
yet
enveloped
in
the
smoke
the
men
flew
up
on
deck
as
they
had
been
previously
directed
by
captain

who
leaped
upon
the
hammocks

frigate
and
holding
with
one
hand
by
the
backstay
with
his
sword
in
the
other

to
encourage
his

waited
a
second
or
two
for
the
closing
of
the
of
the
vessels
before
he
led
on
his
boarders
the
smoke
rolled
away
through
the
masts
of
the
french
frigate
and
discovered
her
captain
with
equal
disregard
to
his
safety
in
nearly
a
similar
position
on
the
hammock

of

were
not

apart
when
the
of

the

drew
a

from

levelled
it
at

fate

to
be
certain
when
at
the
critical
moment
a
hat
thrown
from

of

right
into

the
impetus

spring
passing
it
through

fell
back
on

fortunately
for

wounded

reserved
for
a
worse
fate
that
of
falling
overboard

at
the
heave
of

this
horrid
death

the
carnage
was
not
to
cease
the
french
troops
stationed
in
the
boats
on
the
booms
formed
a
sort
of
pyramid
vomiting
incessant
fire
and
the
commandant
had
had
the
sagacity
to
draw
up
three
lines
of
his
men
with
their
bayonets
fixed
from
one
side
of
the
vessel
to
the
other
abreast
of

a
barrier
behind

the

the

against
the
phalanx
of
bayonets
but
it
was
not
as
the
had
supposed
for
before
the
cutlasses
of
the
seamen
had
time
again
to
strike
fire
upon
the
steel
points
which
opposed
their
passage
mcelvina
reappeared
in
the
of
the
french
vessel
followed
by
his
smugglers
who
attacked
the
french
troops
in
the
rear
with
a
loud
yell
and
an
impetuosity
that
was
irresistible
the
diversion
was
announced
by
a
cheer
from
captain
m
and
his
party
abaft
who
rushing
upon
the
bayonets
of
the
frenchman
already
in
confusion
from
the
attack
of
mcelvina
forced
them
down
on
the
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
hatches
were
secured
over
the
remainder
of
the
crew
and
the
tricoloured
ensign
disappeared
from
the
gaff
and
announced
to
the
spectators
in
the
batteries
on

that
ruled
the
chapter
seventeen
brave
hearts
to
britain
pride
once
so
faithful
and
so
true
on
the
deck
of
fame
that
died
with
the
gallant

soft
sigh
the
winds
of

their
grave
while
the

mournful
rolls

the

hasty
congratulations
between
the
survivors
of
the
victorious
party
were
exchanged
as
they
proceeded
to
obey
the
orders
which
were
issued
by
captain
m
who
directed
their
attention
to
the
relief
of
the
wounded
lying
in
heaps
upon
the
deck
in
many
instances
nearly
smothered
with
the
dead
bodies
which
had
fallen
upon
them
and
which
their
own
exhausted
powers
would
not
permit
them
to
remove
the
task
of
separation
of
those
who
were
past
all
mortal
aid
from
those
who
might
still
derive
benefit
from
surgical
assistance
was
as
tedious
as
it
was
afflicting
no
distinction
was
made
between
the
rival
sufferers
but
as
they
came
to
hand
english
or
french
they
were
carefully
conveyed
to
the
of
the
respective
ships
the
surgeons
of
which
were
in
readiness
to
receive
them
their
turned
up
to
the
elbows
and
hands
and
arms
stained
with
blood
proving
that
they
had
already
been
actively
employed
in
the
duties
of
their
profession
on
the
foremost
part
of
the
larboard
side
of
the
french
where
captain
m
and
his
crew
had
boarded
the
dead
and
dying
lay
in
a
heap
the
summit
of
which
was
level
with
the
tops
of
the
carronades
that
they
were
between
and
an
occasional
low
groan
from
under
the
mass
intimated
that
some
were
there
who
were
dying
more
from
the
pressure
of
the
other
bodies
than
from
the
extent
of
their
own
wounds
captain
m
although
he
had
lost
much
blood
and
was
still
bleeding
profusely
would
not
leave
the
deck
until
he
had
collected
a
party
to
separate
the
pile
and
many
were
relieved
who
in
a
few
minutes
more
would
have
been
suffocated
at
the
bottom
of
the
heap
was
the
body
of
the
gallant
french
captain
and
captain
m
was
giving
directions
to
the
to
have
it
carried
below
when
willy
who
was
earnestly
looking
about
the
deck
brushed
up
against
the
latter
who
said
to
him
come
youngster
out
of
the
way
you
no
use
here
has
any
one
seen
my
hat
interrogated
the
boy
as
he
obeyed
the
order
and
removed
to
a
short
distance
here
it
is
my
bantam
said
one
of
the
boatswain
mates
who
had
discovered
it
as
they
removed
the
body
of
the
french
captain
under
which
it
had
lain
jammed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
then
it
was
to
you
that
i
was
indebted
for
that
assistance
said
captain
m
taking
the
hat
from
the
boatswain
mate
and
restoring
it
as
well
as
he
could
to
its
former
shape
before
he
put
it
on
willy
head
willy
looked
up
in
the
captain
face
and
smiled
assent
as
he
walked
away
a
good
turn
is
never
lost
observed
captain
m
and
the
old
fable
of
the
mouse
and
the
lion
is
constantly
recurring
to
make
us
humble
if
i
had
not
put
that
boy
on
the
i
should
in
all
probability
have
made
a
vacancy
it
was
remarkable
presence
of
mind
on
his
part
we
have
not
broken
in
upon
our
narrative
to
state
that
during
the
scene
we
have
described
mr
pearce
the
master
had
succeeded
in
putting
both
vessels
before
the
wind
although
they
still
were
hugged
in
each
embraces
as
if
they
had
always
been
the
best
friends
in
the
world
and
they
were
now
out
of
the
reach
of
the
enemy
batteries
which
as
soon
as
they
perceived
the
unfavourable
results
of
the
action
had
commenced
firing
with
balls
emblematical
of
their
wrath
when
the
wounded
had
been
carried
below
and
placed
in
comparative
comfort
on
board
of
their
respective
ships
the
dead
bodies
were
next
examined
those
of
the
french
with
the
exception
of
that
of
the
captain
were
launched
overboard
while
those
of
the
english
were
then
removed
and
the
french
officers
having
delivered
up
their
swords
were
permitted
to
remain
on
deck
upon
parole
while
the
men
were
secured
down
below
in
the
fore
and
main
holds
of
the
the
hatchways
being
covered
over
with
a
strong
that
they
might
not
be
deprived
of
fresh
air
in
their
crowded
situation
the
charge
of
the
prize
having
been
confided
to
the
and
fifty
men
the
two
ships
were
separated
and
laid
to
to
repair
the
damages
sustained
in
the
conflict
captain
m
whose
wounds
were
not
serious
had
descended
for
a
short
time
to
have
them
washed
and
dressed
his
anxiety
to
put
his
ship
in
an
efficient
state
and
get
clear
of
the
bay
previous
to
bad
weather
coming
on
had
induced
him
to
return
on
deck
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
a
little
refreshment
mcelvina
had
also
cleansed
himself
from
the
gore
with
which
he
had
been
begrimed
and
having
applied
to
the
surgeon
to
assuage
the
pain
of
a
severe
cut
which
he
had
received
on
his
shoulder
came
upon
the
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
dressed
with
his
usual
precision
and
neatness
he
touched
his
hat
to
captain
m
with
whom
he
had
not
communicated
since
he
had
quitted
him
on
the
of
the
french
frigate
to
create
the
fortunate
diversion
in
favour
of
the
boarders
captain
mcelvina
said
captain
m
taking
his
hand
and
shaking
it
warmly
i
can
hardly
express
how
much
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
conduct
this
day
you
may
be
assured
that
upon
my
return
i
shall
not
fail
to
make
a
proper
representation
of
it
to
government
i
only
wish
that
there
was
any
situation
in
my
ship
that
could
induce
you
to
remain
thank
you
captain
m
replied
mcelvina
smiling
but
although
on
a
smaller
scale
i
have
long
been
accustomed
to
command
and
i
should
be
very
sorry
that
a
vacancy
should
occur
in
the
only
situation
i
would
accept
i
expected
an
answer
to
that
effect
replied
captain
m
however
you
have
this
day
nobly
redeemed
your
character
and
silenced
any
imputations
of
hostility
to
your
country
that
might
be
thrown
upon
you
in
consequence
of
your
late
employment
and
i
sincerely
congratulate
you
captain
m
as
you
are
kind
enough
to
express
friendly
feelings
towards
me
may
i
request
that
they
may
be
shown
by
the
interest
you
take
in
young
seymour
i
can
not
but
approve
his
following
the
honourable
career
marked
out
for
him
and
my
regret
at
parting
with
one
who
has
so
entwined
himself
round
my
heart
will
be
considerably
lessened
by
the
assurance
that
you
will
be
his
friend
and
protector
any
expenses
not
one
word
upon
that
score
replied
captain
m
the
boy
saved
my
life
this
day
by
his
unusual
presence
of
mind
and
i
shall
watch
over
him
as
if
he
were
my
own
child
his
education
shall
be
attended
to
i
pledge
you
my
honour
to
do
him
every
justice
mcelvina
bowed
and
walked
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
the
idea
of
parting
with
willy
was
always
painful
to
him
and
weak
with
the
loss
of
blood
he
was
afraid
that
the
emotion
would
be
perceived
which
he
now
felt
less
able
to
control
thus
it
is
with
proud
man
he
struggles
to
conceal
effects
arising
from
feeling
which
do
honour
to
his
nature
but
feels
no
shame
when
he
disgraces
himself
by
allowing
his
passions
to
get
the
better
of
his
reason
and
all
because
he
would
not
be
thought
particularly
fond
of
crying
myself
the
list
of
killed
and
wounded
was
brought
up
by
the
the
duty
of
the
first
who
was
in
charge
of
the
prize
having
devolved
upon
him
the
former
having
been
ascertained
by
mustering
the
company
the
latter
from
the
report
of
the
surgeon
a
deep
sigh
escaped
from
the
breast
of
the
captain
as
he
looked
own
at
the
total
killed
wounded
this
is
heavy
indeed
poor
stevenson
i
thought
he
was
only
wounded
since
dead
sir
replied
the
we
have
lost
a
pleasant
messmate
and
his
majesty
a
valuable
officer
replied
the
captain
i
am
afraid
his
mother
will
feel
it
in
more
ways
than
one
he
supported
her
i
think
he
did
sir
will
you
not
give
an
acting
order
to
one
of
the
young
gentlemen
it
was
the
over
whom
they
were
lamenting
yes
make
it
out
for
mr
robertson
he
in
the
list
sir
what
killed
so
he
is
poor
fellow
well
then
mr
wheatley
let
it
be
made
out
for
him
ay
ay
sir
it
was
not
until
the
ensuing
day
that
the
loss
of
the
enemy
could
be
ascertained
crowded
as
were
her
decks
with
troops
it
was
enormous
not
only
the
first
and
second
captains
and
seven
junior
officers
of
the
frigate
had
fallen
but
eleven
officers
of
the
detachment
of
soldiers
sent
on
board
of
her
the
total
loss
appeared
to
be
one
hundred
and
killed
and
one
hundred
and
wounded
out
of
an
aggregate
of
nearly
nine
hundred
men
in
a
few
days
the
and
her
prize
arrived
at
plymouth
the
english
colours
proudly
waving
over
the
tricoloured
flag
of
her
late
opponent
and
both
vessels
ran
into
hamoaze
amidst
the
cheers
of
thousands
of
spectators
assembled
upon
mount
wise
and
mount
edgecomb
to
greet
their
gallant
and
successful
defenders
captain
m
immediately
proceeded
to
london
where
the
representation
which
he
made
of
mcelvina
conduct
was
followed
by
an
order
for
his
immediate
release
and
mcelvina
taking
an
affectionate
leave
of
willy
with
a
parting
injunction
to
set
off
to
report
to
old
hornblow
and
his
daughter
susan
all
the
circumstances
attending
the
capture
of
his
lugger
and
the
events
which
had
subsequently
ensued
chapter
eighteen
so
poverty
at
home
and
debts
abroad
my
present
fortune
bad
my
hopes
yet
worse
what
will
become
of
me
southeron
isabella
the
gentleman
who
had
supposed
himself
the
next
heir
to
the
entailed
property
vacant
by
the
demise
of
admiral
de
courcy
and
whose
hasty
visit
and
departure
from
hall
we
have
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
was
a
third
cousin
of
the
deceased
his
history
is
short
he
had
squandered
away
the
personal
property
left
him
by
his
father
and
his
family
estate
which
was
of
greater
extent
than
value
was
mortgaged
for
even
more
than
it
was
worth
he
had
lately
subsisted
by
borrowing
large
sums
of
money
at
exorbitant
interest
upon
the
expectancy
of
succeeding
to
the
property
of
admiral
de
courcy
the
result
of
his
visit
to
the
hall
was
therefore
unsatisfactory
in
more
ways
than
one
and
before
he
had
arrived
at
his
own
residence
his
obsequious
little
friend
in
black
had
reminded
him
of
certain
bonds
which
were
in
his
possession
and
assumed
a
tone
and
demeanour
towards
his
client
very
different
from
that
in
which
he
had
addressed
the
supposed
inheritor
of
the
large
property
of
d
intimating
in
very
plain
terms
that
some
speedy
arrangement
must
be
made
rainscourt
who
had
nothing
left
except
the
old
castle
on
his
property
at
galway
his
manorial
rights
and
the
unbounded
attachment
and
devotion
of
the
wild
tenants
who
looked
upon
him
as
their
feudal
chieftain
felt
convinced
that
he
had
no
resource
but
to
escape
from
his
numerous
creditors
who
would
not
hesitate
to
put
him
in
durance
and
whose
impatience
had
been
with
difficulty
restrained
until
the
death
of
the
admiral
the
upon
which
he
determined
was
to
set
off
immediately
for
ireland
and
by
regaining
his
castle
defy
legal
authority
if
there
could
be
found
any
that
would
be
rash
enough
to
attempt
his
person
when
encircled
by
his
lawless
retainers
as
he
descended
from
the
chaise
at
the
handsomely
furnished
lodgings
in
the
west
end
of
the
metropolis
which
he
had
engaged
his
companion
informed
him
with
a
haughty
air
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
paying
his
respects
on
the
ensuing
noon
while
rainscourt
with
his
usual
indifference
to
money
dismissed
the
post
boys
with
a
handsome
gratuity
although
there
were
not
many
guineas
left
in
his
purse
and
then
proceeded
up
to
the
drawing
room
on
the
where
his
wife
and
only
daughter
were
anxiously
awaiting
his
arrival
mrs
rainscourt
still
a
fine
and
elegant
woman
had
in
her
youth
been
remarkable
for
her
great
personal
attractions
and
for
two
seasons
had
been
considered
as
the
belle
of
the
irish
metropolis
she
was
at
that
period
a
and
girl
easily
provoked
and
as
easily
appeased
proud
of
her
beauty
and
her
accomplishments
which
her
parents
were
in
hopes
would
be
bartered
for
a
coronet
rainscourt
was
also
at
that
time
one
of
the
handsomest
if
not
the
handsomest
man
in
ireland
with
the
advantage
of
polished
manners
talent
and
ancient
birth
received
and
courted
in
every
society
he
was
as
indefatigable
in
squandering
away
his
property
as
the
parents
of
mrs
rainscourt
were
in
trying
to
obtain
an
advantageous
establishment
for
their
daughter
rainscourt
was
proud
and
overbearing
in
disposition
vain
to
excess
of
his
personal
advantages
he
considered
himself
irresistible
with
the
other
sex
he
had
seen
and
admired
his
future
spouse
but
still
as
he
required
an
alliance
which
would
enable
him
to
indulge
in
his
extravagance
and
as
her
parents
were
aware
that
rainscourt
was
or
would
soon
be
a
ruined
man
in
all
probability
they
would
never
have
come
in
contact
but
have
rolled
in
different
orbits
more
consonant
to
their
views
and
their
happiness
had
it
not
occurred
that
at
a
large
and
convivial
party
vanity
had
been
piqued
by
his
companions
who
told
him
that
he
never
could
obtain
the
hand
of
miss
whose
parents
aspired
to
a
higher
connection
piqued
at
this
remark
and
flushed
with
the
wine
that
had
been
freely
circulated
he
offered
to
stake
a
considerable
sum
that
he
would
succeed
before
a
certain
allotted
time
the
wager
was
accepted
rainscourt
courted
without
affection
and
by
his
assiduities
and
feigned
attachment
ultimately
succeeded
in
persuading
the
fond
girl
to
destroy
all
the
golden
visions
of
her
parent
and
resign
herself
to
his
arms
where
he
assured
her
that
competence
and
love
would
be
found
more
than
commensurate
to
a
coronet
and
neglect
they
eloped
all
dublin
was
in
an
uproar
for
three
days
rainscourt
received
the
amount
of
his
bet
and
the
congratulations
of
his
friends
and
for
a
short
time
he
and
his
wife
lived
together
without
any
serious
fracas
the
first
that
occurred
proceeded
from
an
anonymous
letter
evidently
written
by
some
envious
and
disappointed
female
acquainting
mrs
rainscourt
with
all
the
circumstances
attending
the
bet
to
which
she
had
been
sacrificed
this
mortifying
news
was
received
with
showers
of
tears
and
some
upbraiding
for
mrs
rainscourt
really
loved
her
husband
and
although
patched
up
by
rainscourt
protestations
as
to
the
falsehood
of
the
accusation
it
sunk
deep
into
her
heart
and
was
but
the
forerunner
of
future
misery
rainscourt
soon
became
tired
of
a
woman
whom
he
had
never
loved
cursed
his
own
vanity
that
had
induced
him
to
saddle
himself
with
such
an
encumbrance
as
a
wife
and
by
alternate
violence
and
moroseness
irritated
her
feelings
and
roused
her
spirit
neglect
on
his
part
produced
indifference
on
her
side
and
as
the
means
of
gaiety
and
expense
melted
away
so
did
all
respect
and
esteem
for
each
other
an
extravagant
man
seldom
makes
a
good
husband
he
becomes
embarrassed
and
his
circumstances
prey
upon
his
mind
and
sour
his
temper
a
woman
who
has
before
marriage
been
the
admiration
of
the
metropolis
is
not
very
likely
to
prove
a
good
wife
she
still
sighs
for
the
adulation
that
she
received
and
which
from
habit
has
become
necessary
to
her
and
would
exact
from
the
man
for
whom
she
has
given
up
the
world
all
the
attention
that
she
has
lost
by
the
sacrifice
mr
and
mrs
rainscourt
were
joined
but
they
were
not
one
like
many
others
in
this
world
of
error
their
marriage
might
be
typified
by
a
vial
of
which
one
half
had
been
filled
with
oil
and
the
other
with
water
having
a
cork
in
its
mouth
which
confined
them
and
forced
them
to
remain
in
contact
although
they
refused
to
unite
the
fruit
of
this
marriage
was
one
daughter
now
about
six
years
old
well
mr
rainscourt
all
is
well
i
hope
and
may
i
not
kiss
my
daughter
and
congratulate
her
upon
being
one
of
the
largest
heiresses
in
the
kingdom
you
may
if
you
please
madam
may
if
i
please
why
is
it
not
so
mr
rainscourt
replied
the
lady
startled
at
the
moody
brow
of
her
husband
as
he
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
now
rainscourt
would
not
have
so
immediately
answered
the
question
but
he
was
determined
that
his
spouse
should
participate
in
those
pangs
of
disappointment
which
swelled
his
own
breast
as
a
partner
of
all
his
joys
she
was
of
course
fully
entitles
to
an
equal
proportion
of
his
cares
no
madam
it
is
not
so
surely
you
are
trifling
with
me
mr
rainscourt
is
not
the
admiral
dead
yes
madam
and
his
grandchild
is
alive
his
grandchild
cried
the
lady
in
pallid
with
vexation
and
disappointment
well
mr
rainscourt
this
is
another
specimen
of
your
usual
prudence
and
foresight
what
man
in
his
senses
would
not
have
ascertained
such
a
fact
previous
to
squandering
away
his
whole
property
and
leaving
his
daughter
a
beggar
i
think
madam
if
the
property
has
been
squandered
as
you
term
it
that
you
have
assisted
me
in
so
doing
at
all
events
the
property
was
my
own
for
i
can
not
exactly
recollect
that
you
increased
it
one
shilling
when
i
married
you
certainly
not
much
mr
rainscourt
except
indeed
the
amount
of
the
bet
i
consider
that
as
my
marriage
portion
replied
the
lady
with
a
sneer
never
made
a
worse
bet
in
my
life
replied
the
gentleman
throwing
his
legs
upon
the
sofa
perhaps
not
replied
his
wife
with
offended
seriousness
but
recollect
mr
rainscourt
that
have
no
one
to
blame
but
yourself
were
not
deceived
i
might
have
been
happy
might
have
met
with
sincerity
and
reciprocal
affection
your
conduct
towards
me
was
an
act
of
cruelty
which
would
have
called
forth
some
compunction
in
the
breast
of
my
bitterest
enemy
and
yet
unoffending
i
was
heartlessly
sacrificed
to
your
vanity
say
rather
to
your
own
which
blinded
you
or
you
would
have
been
able
to
discriminate
better
mrs
rainscourt
burst
into
tears
before
her
emotion
could
be
controlled
her
husband
who
was
hardened
to
these
scenes
of
alternate
anger
and
grief
either
was
or
pretended
to
be
in
a
sound
sleep
the
little
girl
had
nestled
close
to
her
mother
at
the
ebullition
of
her
feelings
and
waited
in
silence
until
it
was
exhausted
why
mamma
i
thought
you
said
we
should
be
so
happy
now
did
i
my
dear
replied
mrs
rainscourt
mournfully
yes
you
did
and
told
me
that
we
should
have
a
fine
house
in
london
and
that
we
should
not
go
back
to
the
old
castle
again
i
was
sorry
for
that
though
where
shall
we
go
now
mamma
god
knows
my
child
you
must
ask
your
father
papa
asleep
and
i
must
not
wake
him
i
do
hope
we
shall
go
back
to
the
castle
then
you
have
your
wish
my
love
replied
mr
rainscourt
rousing
up
for
i
start
this
very
evening
are
we
to
go
with
you
mr
rainscourt
asked
mrs
rainscourt
calmly
or
are
we
to
be
left
here
as
you
please
but
i
must
be
off
for
that
little
scoundrel
t
threatened
me
with
a
visit
morning
as
i
got
out
of
the
chaise
and
i
am
aware
that
he
will
not
come
without
a
companion
or
two
t
what
t
your
friend
t
that
you
brought
from
dublin
with
you
and
who
professes
so
much
admiration
and
esteem
your
own
factotum
yes
my
own
factotum
snivelling
little
scoundrel
but
however
there
not
time
to
be
lost
you
have
some
jewels
my
dear
and
other
articles
of
value
you
had
better
pack
them
up
and
consign
them
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
you
may
then
take
your
choice
go
with
me
now
or
follow
me
in
a
day
or
two
they
can
not
arrest
i
am
aware
of
that
mr
rainscourt
replied
the
lady
but
as
i
may
not
have
the
means
of
following
my
daughter
and
i
will
if
you
please
become
a
part
of
your
travelling
incumbrance
as
well
as
the
jewels
and
articles
of
value
be
it
so
replied
the
gentleman
who
perfectly
understood
her
sarcastic
meaning
but
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
retort
at
the
moment
one
will
carry
us
all
but
we
must
leave
town
at
twelve
this
night
if
i
recollect
right
we
are
asked
to
a
rout
at
lady
g
we
are
but
pray
mr
rainscourt
how
am
i
to
get
ready
so
soon
the
servants
must
be
paid
all
the
bills
must
be
called
in
if
you
wait
until
i
can
pay
all
the
bills
you
must
wait
till
eternity
perhaps
pack
up
everything
that
is
portable
without
the
knowledge
of
the
servants
your
jewels
you
can
have
upon
your
own
person
or
in
a
pocket
if
you
ever
wear
one
order
the
carriage
dress
and
we
will
both
go
to
the
rout
i
shall
leave
word
with
roberts
to
bring
me
any
letters
which
may
be
sent
telling
him
that
the
admiral
is
not
dead
yet
although
hourly
expected
nothing
has
transpired
to
the
contrary
i
can
slip
away
from
the
rout
and
write
the
letter
myself
which
i
will
send
by
a
porter
when
i
go
home
and
the
chaise
which
i
shall
order
is
at
the
door
i
will
put
emily
in
it
and
call
for
you
at
lady
g
the
servants
may
suspect
something
but
it
will
then
be
too
late
danger
will
unite
those
who
are
at
variance
mrs
r
entered
readily
into
the
proposed
arrangements
which
necessity
imposed
upon
them
and
in
a
few
hours
father
mother
and
daughter
were
on
their
way
to
ireland
leaving
the
butcher
baker
chandler
and
all
other
bills
of
no
trifling
sum
total
to
be
paid
at
some
more
favourable
opportunity
the
servants
indemnified
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
by
seizing
what
was
left
and
cursing
the
elopers
and
the
obsequious
little
gentleman
in
black
vowed
vengeance
as
he
quitted
the
deserted
mansion
to
which
he
had
paid
his
promised
visit
in
the
morning
with
a
particular
friend
or
two
to
enforce
his
arguments
with
mr
rainscourt
chapter
nineteen
have
you
provided
me
here
half
a
dozen
sufficient
men
marry
have
we
sir
let
me
see
them
i
beseech
you
where
the
roll
where
the
roll
let
them
appear
as
i
call
shakespeare
as
the
reader
will
have
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
them
hereafter
i
must
now
enter
into
some
description
of
the
characters
of
the
captain
and
officers
with
whom
our
hero
was
fated
to
be
a
shipmate
to
begin
with
the
captain
who
has
already
made
his
appearance
in
the
course
of
these
pages
captain
m
was
the
son
of
a
gentleman
one
of
the
numerous
class
still
existing
in
this
world
who
have
inherited
large
ideas
and
small
fortunes
as
usual
the
latter
were
got
rid
of
much
sooner
than
the
former
the
consequence
was
that
although
young
m
was
an
only
son
it
was
considered
advisable
that
he
should
be
brought
up
to
some
profession
the
naval
service
was
selected
by
himself
and
approved
of
by
his
father
who
although
he
had
no
money
had
some
interest
that
is
to
say
he
had
powerful
and
wealthy
connections
who
for
their
own
sakes
rather
than
have
to
support
their
young
relation
would
exert
themselves
to
make
him
independent
m
rose
to
the
rank
of
as
fast
as
his
friends
could
wish
and
did
credit
to
their
patronage
having
once
obtained
for
him
the
highest
rank
that
the
profession
could
offer
until
he
became
an
admiral
from
seniority
they
thought
that
they
had
done
enough
and
had
it
not
been
that
captain
m
by
his
zeal
and
abilities
had
secured
a
personal
interest
at
the
board
he
might
have
languished
on
but
his
services
were
appreciated
and
he
was
too
good
an
officer
not
to
be
employed
his
father
was
dead
and
the
payment
of
debts
which
he
had
contracted
and
the
purchase
of
an
annuity
for
his
mother
had
swallowed
up
almost
all
the
which
captain
m
who
had
been
very
successful
had
realised
but
he
was
single
from
choice
and
frugal
from
habit
his
pay
and
the
interest
of
the
small
remains
of
in
the
funds
were
more
than
adequate
to
his
wants
he
was
enthusiastic
in
his
profession
and
had
the
bad
taste
to
prefer
a
fine
ship
to
a
fine
lady
having
entered
the
service
at
a
later
period
than
was
usual
he
had
the
advantage
of
an
excellent
education
which
being
naturally
of
a
serious
disposition
and
fond
of
reading
he
had
very
much
improved
by
study
as
an
officer
he
was
a
perfect
master
of
his
profession
both
in
theory
and
practice
and
was
what
is
termed
afloat
all
for
the
service
indeed
this
feeling
was
so
powerful
in
him
that
like
aaron
rod
it
swallowed
up
all
the
rest
if
there
was
any
blemish
in
his
character
it
was
in
this
point
correct
himself
he
made
no
allowance
for
indiscretion
inflexibly
severe
but
always
just
he
in
no
instance
ever
spared
himself
nor
would
he
ever
be
persuaded
to
spare
others
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
service
as
laid
down
by
the
board
of
admiralty
and
the
articles
of
war
were
as
rigidly
observed
by
him
and
extracted
from
others
as
if
they
had
been
added
to
the
decalogue
and
any
deviation
or
neglect
was
sure
to
bring
down
reprimand
or
punishment
upon
the
offender
whether
it
happened
to
be
the
senior
lieutenant
or
the
smallest
boy
in
the
ship
company
but
with
all
his
severity
so
determined
was
captain
m
to
be
just
that
he
never
would
exercise
the
power
without
due
reflection
on
one
occasion
in
which
the
conduct
of
a
sailor
had
been
very
offensive
the
first
lieutenant
observed
that
summary
punishment
would
have
a
very
beneficial
effect
upon
the
ship
company
in
general
perhaps
it
might
mr
h
replied
he
but
it
is
against
a
rule
which
i
have
laid
down
and
from
which
i
never
deviate
irritated
as
i
am
at
this
moment
with
the
man
conduct
i
may
perhaps
consider
it
in
a
more
heinous
light
than
it
deserves
and
be
guilty
of
too
great
severity
i
am
liable
to
error
subject
as
others
to
be
led
away
by
the
feelings
of
the
moment
and
have
therefore
made
a
compact
with
myself
never
to
punish
until
hours
after
the
offence
has
been
committed
and
so
repeatedly
when
at
the
time
i
have
settled
in
my
mind
the
quantum
of
punishment
that
the
offender
should
receive
have
i
found
upon
reflection
which
delay
has
given
time
for
reasons
to
mitigate
the
severity
that
i
wish
for
the
benefit
of
the
service
that
the
admiralty
would
give
a
standing
order
to
that
effect
such
was
the
character
of
captain
m
it
hardly
need
be
added
after
the
events
already
narrated
of
this
history
that
he
was
a
man
of
undaunted
bravery
in
his
person
he
was
tall
and
rather
slight
in
figure
his
features
were
regular
but
there
was
a
sternness
in
his
countenance
and
lines
of
deep
thought
on
his
brow
which
rendered
the
expression
unpleasing
it
was
only
when
he
smiled
that
you
would
have
pronounced
him
handsome
then
he
was
more
than
handsome
he
was
fascinating
mr
bully
the
who
was
the
in
the
ship
in
the
action
with
the
french
frigate
was
an
officer
who
well
understood
his
duty
he
had
the
merit
of
implicitly
obeying
all
orders
and
considering
the
fact
that
a
first
lieutenant
has
always
sufficient
cause
to
be
put
out
of
temper
at
least
twenty
times
during
the
twelve
hours
he
was
as
as
a
could
possibly
be
he
had
entered
the
service
when
very
young
and
being
of
humble
extraction
had
not
had
any
advantage
of
education
in
person
he
was
short
and
and
having
suffered
severely
from
the
during
his
infancy
was
by
no
means
prepossessing
in
his
outward
appearance
the
whose
name
was
price
was
a
young
man
who
kept
his
watch
and
read
shakespeare
he
was
constantly
attempting
to
quote
his
favourite
author
but
fortunately
for
those
who
were
not
fond
of
quotations
his
memory
was
very
defective
mr
courtenay
the
was
a
little
personage
who
to
use
the
master
phraseology
was
never
quite
happy
unless
he
was
damned
miserable
he
was
full
of
misfortunes
and
grievances
and
always
complaining
or
laughing
at
his
real
or
imaginary
disasters
but
his
complaint
would
often
end
in
a
laugh
or
his
mirth
terminate
in
a
whine
you
never
could
exactly
say
whether
he
was
in
joke
or
in
earnest
there
was
such
a
humour
about
him
that
one
side
of
his
countenance
would
express
pleasure
while
the
other
indicated
vexation
there
seemed
to
be
a
perpetual
war
in
his
composition
of
bile
both
of
which
were
most
unaccountably
blended
in
the
same
temperament
according
to
seniority
mr
pearce
the
master
is
the
next
to
be
introduced
to
the
reader
in
external
appearance
a
rough
but
with
an
unpromising
exterior
he
was
a
man
with
sense
and
feeling
he
had
every
requisite
for
his
situation
his
nerves
were
like
a
he
was
correct
and
zealous
in
his
duty
and
a
great
favourite
of
the
captain
who
was
his
countryman
he
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
a
married
man
with
a
large
family
the
surgeon
whose
name
was
macallan
was
also
most
deservedly
a
great
favourite
with
captain
m
indeed
there
was
a
friendship
between
them
grown
out
of
long
acquaintance
with
each
other
worth
inconsistent
with
and
unusual
in
a
service
where
the
almost
despotic
power
of
the
superior
renders
the
intimacy
of
the
inferior
similar
to
the
smoothing
with
your
hand
the
paw
of
a
lion
whose
fangs
in
a
moment
of
caprice
may
be
darted
into
your
flesh
he
was
a
spare
man
of
about
years
of
age
and
had
graduated
and
received
his
diploma
at
edinburgh
an
unusual
circumstance
at
that
period
although
the
education
in
the
service
was
so
defective
that
the
medical
officers
were
generally
the
best
informed
in
the
ship
but
he
was
more
than
the
above
he
was
a
naturalist
a
man
of
profound
research
and
well
informed
upon
most
points
of
an
amiable
and
gentle
disposition
and
a
sincere
christian
it
would
naturally
be
inferred
that
those
whose
profession
it
is
to
investigate
the
human
frame
and
constantly
have
before
their
eyes
the
truth
that
we
are
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
would
be
more
inclined
than
others
to
acknowledge
the
infinite
wisdom
and
power
but
this
is
too
often
found
not
to
be
the
case
and
it
would
appear
as
if
the
old
scholium
that
too
much
familiarity
breeds
contempt
may
be
found
to
act
upon
the
human
mind
even
when
in
communion
with
the
deity
with
what
awe
does
the
first
acquaintance
with
death
impress
us
what
a
thrill
passes
through
the
living
as
it
bends
over
the
inanimate
body
from
which
the
spirit
has
departed
the
clay
that
returns
to
the
dust
from
which
it
sprung
the
tenement
that
was
lately
endued
with
volition
and
life
the
frame
that
exhibited
a
perfection
of
mechanism
deriding
all
human
power
and
confounding
all
human
imagination
now
an
inanimate
mass
rapidly
decomposing
and
soon
to
become
a
heap
of
corruption
strong
as
the
feeling
is
how
evanescent
it
becomes
when
once
familiarised
it
has
no
longer
power
over
the
senses
and
the
soldier
and
sailor
pillow
themselves
on
the
corpse
with
perfect
indifference
if
not
with
a
jest
so
it
is
with
those
who
are
accustomed
to
arrangements
who
wash
and
lay
out
the
body
previous
to
interment
yet
although
we
acknowledge
that
habit
will
remove
the
first
impressions
of
awe
how
is
it
that
the
minute
investigation
upon
which
conviction
ought
to
be
founded
should
too
often
have
the
contrary
effect
from
that
which
it
should
produce
is
it
because
mystery
the
parent
of
awe
is
in
a
certain
degree
removed
faith
says
the
apostle
is
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
there
would
be
no
merit
in
believing
what
is
perfectly
evident
to
the
senses
yet
some
would
argue
that
the
evidence
ought
to
be
more
clear
and
palpable
if
so
would
not
the
awe
be
also
removed
and
would
religion
gain
by
it
we
have
enough
imparted
to
convince
us
that
all
is
right
and
is
not
that
which
is
hidden
or
secret
purposely
intended
to
produce
that
awe
without
which
the
proud
mind
of
man
would
spurn
at
infinite
wisdom
the
above
digression
had
nearly
caused
me
to
omit
that
macallan
had
one
peculiar
failing
his
language
from
long
study
had
been
borrowed
from
books
more
than
from
men
and
when
he
entered
upon
his
favourite
science
of
natural
history
his
enthusiasm
made
him
more
pedantic
in
his
style
and
pompous
in
his
phraseology
than
ever
but
who
is
perfect
the
purser
was
an
elderly
man
very
careful
of
the
pounds
shillings
and
pence
he
was
affected
with
an
incurable
deafness
which
he
never
thought
proper
to
acknowledge
but
catching
at
a
word
or
two
in
the
sentence
would
frame
his
answer
accordingly
occasioning
frequent
mirth
to
his
whom
he
imagined
were
laughing
with
and
not
at
him
for
the
present
i
shall
pass
over
the
rest
of
the
officers
with
the
exception
of
the
boatswain
whose
character
was
of
a
very
peculiar
nature
he
was
a
man
who
had
long
been
considered
as
one
of
the
best
boatswains
in
the
service
and
had
been
applied
for
by
captain
m
he
used
his
cane
with
severity
but
had
always
some
jest
at
hand
to
soften
down
the
smart
of
the
blow
and
was
very
active
in
his
own
person
setting
an
example
to
the
men
it
had
however
happened
that
about
a
year
before
he
joined
mr
hardsett
had
been
induced
by
his
wife
to
go
with
her
to
a
conventicle
which
the
rising
sect
of
methodists
had
established
at
the
port
where
she
resided
and
whether
it
was
that
his
former
life
smote
his
conscience
or
that
the
preacher
was
unusually
powerful
he
soon
became
one
of
the
most
zealous
of
his
converts
he
read
nothing
but
his
bible
which
employed
all
his
leisure
hours
and
he
was
continually
quoting
it
in
his
conversation
but
he
was
not
exactly
a
methodist
taking
the
cognomen
in
the
worst
or
the
best
interpretation
he
was
an
enthusiast
and
a
fanatic
notwithstanding
which
he
contrived
that
his
duty
towards
his
maker
should
not
interfere
with
that
of
boatswain
of
the
ship
captain
m
regretted
the
man
bigotry
but
as
he
never
tried
to
make
any
converts
and
did
his
duty
in
his
situation
the
captain
did
not
attempt
to
interfere
with
his
religious
opinions
the
more
so
as
he
was
convinced
that
hardsett
was
sincere
the
was
but
a
short
time
in
harbour
for
the
captain
was
anxious
to
add
to
the
laurels
which
he
had
already
won
and
having
reported
the
ship
ready
for
sea
received
an
order
to
proceed
to
the
west
india
station
the
frigate
was
unmoored
the
hoisted
and
the
loosened
as
the
signal
for
departure
and
after
lying
a
short
time
with
her
anchor
short
stay
apeak
captain
m
came
on
board
the
anchor
was
run
up
to
the
bows
and
once
more
the
frigate
started
like
an
armed
knight
in
search
of
battle
and
adventure
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
and
the
tenants
of
the
had
assembled
to
their
repast
now
all
my
misery
is
about
to
commence
cried
courtenay
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
table
on
which
the
dinner
was
smoking
in
all
the
variety
of
irish
stew
and
boiled
mutton
with
caper
sauce
indeed
said
the
master
pray
then
what
is
it
that
you
have
been
grumbling
about
ever
since
you
have
joined
the
ship
psha
they
were
only
petty
vexations
but
now
we
are
at
sea
i
shall
be
i
am
always
obliged
to
throw
off
the
accumulation
of
bile
whenever
i
go
out
of
harbour
i
say
doctor
replied
pearce
can
you
stop
up
the
leak
in
that
little
gentleman
liver
he
not
content
to
keep
a
going
to
get
rid
of
his
bile
when
in
harbour
but
it
seems
that
he
requires
the
to
be
manned
when
he
goes
to
sea
exclaimed
courtenay
shuddering
and
drawing
back
his
head
with
a
grimace
at
the
idea
of
such
a
forcible
discharge
and
then
looking
round
at
his
messmates
with
one
of
his
faces
pumps
ay
said
price
you
remember
shakespeare
in
the
he
says
dear
me
i
come
price
said
courtenay
do
make
me
sick
before
my
time
unkind
you
do
know
what
an
analogy
there
is
between
spouting
and
in
both
cases
you
throw
up
what
is
nauseous
because
your
head
or
you
stomach
is
too
weak
to
retain
it
spare
me
then
a
quotation
my
dear
fellow
till
you
see
me
in
the
agony
of
nature
and
then
one
will
be
of
service
in
assisting
her
efforts
to
off
i
say
billy
pitt
did
you
stow
away
the
two
jars
of
pickled
cabbage
in
my
cabin
we
must
here
break
off
the
conversation
to
introduce
this
personage
to
the
reader
he
was
a
black
who
ran
away
when
quite
a
lad
from
his
master
at
barbadoes
and
entered
on
board
of
a
macallan
the
surgeon
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
and
he
had
been
his
servant
for
some
years
following
him
into
different
ships
he
was
a
very
intelligent
and
singular
character
macallan
had
taught
him
to
read
and
write
and
he
was
not
a
little
proud
of
his
acquirements
he
was
excessively
and
a
general
favourite
of
the
officers
and
ship
company
who
used
to
amuse
themselves
with
his
peculiarities
and
allow
him
a
greater
freedom
than
usual
but
billy
grand
in
his
own
opinion
was
a
lexicographer
he
had
a
small
dictionary
which
he
always
carried
in
his
and
nothing
gave
him
so
much
pleasure
as
any
one
referring
to
him
for
the
meaning
of
a
hard
word
which
although
he
could
not
always
explain
correctly
he
certainly
did
most
readily
moreover
he
was
as
may
be
supposed
very
fond
of
interlarding
his
conversation
with
phraseology
without
much
regard
as
to
the
context
although
billy
pitt
was
the
doctor
servant
courtenay
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
him
used
to
employ
him
as
his
own
to
which
as
the
doctor
was
not
a
man
who
required
much
attendance
himself
and
was
very
no
objection
had
been
raised
we
must
repeat
the
question
i
say
billy
pitt
did
you
stow
away
the
two
jars
of
pickled
cabbage
in
my
cabin
no
sar
i
no
to
stow
woman
say
that
mr
kartney
not
pay
for
the
pickled
onun
say
quite
incongrous
send
any
more
not
pay
for
the
onions
no
to
be
sure
i
did
but
i
gave
her
a
fresh
order
which
is
the
same
thing
price
laid
down
the
potato
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
peeling
and
stared
at
courtenay
with
astonishment
well
to
a
london
tradesman
it
is
i
can
assure
you
it
may
be
but
i
can
not
conceive
how
if
you
owe
me
ten
shillings
i
ca
consider
borrowing
ten
more
the
same
thing
as
paying
the
first
pooh
you
do
not
understand
these
things
i
do
not
most
certainly
replied
the
master
resuming
his
potato
and
so
you
have
got
them
resumed
courtenay
to
the
servant
no
sar
she
say
massa
kartney
owe
nine
shillings
for
onuns
and
say
i
owe
farteen
for
and
not
trust
us
any
more
i
tell
just
as
she
say
sir
gentleman
never
pay
for
anything
she
call
me
damned
nigger
and
say
like
massa
like
man
i
tell
her
not
give
any
more
and
walk
out
of
shop
well
how
cursed
annoying
now
i
never
set
my
mind
upon
anything
but
i
disappointed
one
might
as
well
be
sancho
in
the
isle
of
barataria
i
think
i
go
up
to
the
captain
and
ask
him
to
while
i
send
for
them
do
you
think
he
would
master
eh
said
courtenay
in
affected
simplicity
of
interrogation
you
had
better
try
him
replied
pearce
laughing
well
it
would
be
very
considerate
of
him
and
pickled
cabbage
is
the
only
thing
that
cures
my
perceiving
price
about
to
speak
stop
now
it
no
use
there
not
a
word
about
pickled
cabbage
in
shakespeare
i
did
not
say
that
there
was
retorted
price
but
there
without
mustard
and
that
will
be
your
case
now
and
there
me
down
an
ass
replied
courtenay
who
was
not
a
little
vexed
at
the
loss
of
his
favourite
condiment
did
you
hear
what
courtenay
said
of
you
continued
price
turning
to
the
purser
yes
yes
i
know
hand
him
over
a
glass
but
this
is
not
a
clane
one
steward
will
you
bring
a
clane
the
rest
laughed
while
courtenay
proceeded
why
you
hear
better
than
ever
i
say
doctor
you
must
put
me
in
the
sick
list
i
not
fit
to
take
charge
of
a
watch
if
you
prove
that
to
me
replied
macallan
i
certainly
will
report
you
well
i
prove
it
to
you
in
five
seconds
i
just
in
that
state
that
if
everything
in
the
ship
was
to
go
overboard
to
the
devil
i
should
care
now
with
such
a
feeling
of
indifference
a
person
is
not
fit
to
be
trusted
with
the
charge
of
a
watch
that
you
not
fit
to
be
trusted
with
the
charge
of
a
watch
as
you
state
it
yourself
i
shall
not
deny
replied
macallan
but
i
consider
that
to
be
a
complaint
for
which
you
ought
rather
to
be
put
the
list
that
on
it
ha
ha
ha
i
say
courtenay
you
know
what
shakespeare
says
the
curse
of
service
that
that
all
hands
ship
now
resounded
through
the
ship
as
it
was
repeated
in
the
variety
of
basses
of
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
at
either
hatchway
one
of
the
youngsters
of
the
watch
running
down
at
the
same
time
to
acquaint
the
officers
in
his
shrill
falsetto
with
that
which
had
been
roared
out
loud
enough
to
startle
even
the
deaf
purser
the
followed
by
the
master
brushed
by
him
and
was
up
the
ladder
before
his
supererogatory
communication
could
be
delivered
how
cursed
annoying
cried
courtenay
i
was
just
feeling
a
little
better
and
now
i
shall
be
worse
than
ever
you
recollect
in
the
said
price
where
shakespeare
says
forecastle
there
roared
out
captain
m
from
the
in
a
voice
that
was
distinctly
heard
below
by
jove
you
better
skip
for
it
or
you
have
what
captain
m
says
he
hailing
your
station
said
courtenay
laughing
a
piece
of
advice
immediately
acted
upon
by
price
who
was
up
the
ladder
and
on
the
forecastle
in
a
few
and
i
must
go
up
too
how
cursed
annoying
to
be
stationed
in
the
waist
nothing
to
do
except
to
stop
my
ears
against
the
infernal
of
the
marines
and
over
my
head
sweet
music
to
a
but
to
me
discord
most
horrible
i
could
with
vexation
had
you
not
better
first
and
afterwards
observed
the
surgeon
drily
i
think
i
had
indeed
replied
courtenay
as
he
bolted
out
of
the
cursed
annoying
but
the
captain
such
a
bilious
subject
chapter
twenty
this
chair
shall
be
my
state
this
dagger
my
sceptre
and
this

crown
henry
iv
part
i
we
must
now
descend
to
the
steerage
where
our
hero
is
seated
in
the
berth
in
company
with
a
dozen
more
as
they
designated
themselves
from
the
extreme
heat
of
their
domicile
young
heroes
who
were
amusing
themselves
with
crunching
hard
biscuits
and
at
the
same
time
a
due
proportion
of
those
little
animals
of
the
scaribee
tribe
denominated
weevils
who
had
located
themselves
in
the
and
which
the
midshipmen
declared
to
be
the
only
fresh
meat
which
they
had
tasted
for
some
time
captain
m
character
stood
so
high
at
the
admiralty
that
the
major
part
of
the
young
who
had
been
committed
to
his
charge
were
of
good
family
and
connections
at
that
time
few
of
the
aristocracy
or
gentry
ventured
to
send
their
sons
into
the
navy
whereas
at
present
none
but
those
classes
can
obtain
admission
a
better
school
for
training
young
officers
could
not
have
been
selected
and
the
midshipmen
berth
of
the
was
as
superior
to
those
in
other
ships
as
captain
m
was
himself
to
the
generality
of
his
contemporary
captains
in
the
service
but
i
can
not
pay
these
young
men
the
compliment
to
introduce
them
one
by
one
as
i
did
the
officers
it
would
be
an
anomaly
unheard
of
i
shall
therefore
with
every
respect
for
them
describe
them
just
as
i
want
them
it
was
one
bell
after
eight
a
bottle
of
ship
rum
a
black
jack
of
putrid
water
and
a
tin
are
on
the
table
which
is
lighted
with
a
tallow
candle
of
about
thirteen
to
the
pound
i
say
mr
jerry
sneak
what
are
you
after
there
what
are
you
foraging
for
in
that
locker
said
one
of
the
oldsters
of
the
berth
to
a
object
of
a
youngster
whose
friends
had
sent
him
to
sea
with
the
hopes
of
improving
his
stamina
what
for
why
for
my
supper
if
you
must
know
d
think
i
too
i
stowed
it
away
before
i
went
on
deck
that
it
might
not
fall
into
your
ravenous
maw
mind
your
stops
my
jack
of
the
bonehouse
or
i
shall
shy
a
biscuit
at
your
head
do
and
prove
your
bravery
it
will
be
so
very
courageous
i
suppose
you
will
expect
to
be
gazetted
for
it
the
youngster
who
had
been
dignified
with
the
above
sobriquet
and
who
made
these
replies
was
certainly
a
most
object
and
looked
as
if
a
breeze
would
have
blown
him
to
atoms
but
if
his
body
was
weak
his
tongue
was
most
powerful
he
resorted
to
no
other
weapon
and
used
that
skilfully
he
was
a
species
of
thersites
and
no
dread
of
punishment
could
control
his
railing
he
offered
no
resistance
but
bent
down
like
the
reed
and
resumed
his
former
position
as
soon
as
the
storm
was
over
his
keen
and
sarcastic
remarks
although
they
occasionally
subjected
him
to
chastisement
to
a
certain
degree
served
him
as
a
defence
for
he
could
always
raise
a
laugh
at
the
expense
of
the
individual
whom
he
attacked
with
the
formidable
weapon
which
he
had
inherited
direct
from
his
mother
the
oldster
before
mentioned
put
his
hand
into
the
breadbasket
and
seized
a
handful
of
the
biscuit
now
i
bet
you
a
glass
of
grog
that
you
do
throw
a
biscuit
at
my
head
cried
jerry
with
a
sneer
done
replied
the
oldster
throwing
the
contents
of
his
hand
at
jerry
with
all
his
force
i
just
trouble
you
for
that
glass
of
grog
for
you
lost
said
the
youngster
taking
it
up
from
the
table
where
it
stood
before
the
oldster
you
only
thrown
some
pieces
and
not
a
biscuit
and
following
up
his
words
with
deeds
he
swallowed
down
the
whole
contents
of
the
tumbler
which
he
replaced
very
coolly
before
his
opponent
fair
bet
and
fairly
lost
cried
the
rest
of
the
berth
laughing
you
scarecrow
you
not
worth
thrashing
said
the
oldster
angrily
why
that
exactly
what
i
have
been
trying
to
impress
upon
your
memory
ever
since
i
have
joined
the
ship
there
no
credit
to
be
gained
by
licking
a
wretch
like
i
am
but
there
bruce
now
pointing
to
one
of
the
oldsters
between
whom
and
his
opponent
a
jealousy
subsisted
why
do
you
lick
him
there
would
be
some
credit
in
that
but
you
know
better
than
to
try
it
do
i
retorted
the
oldster
forgetting
himself
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
yes
you
do
replied
bruce
jumping
up
in
defiance
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
a
disturbance
much
to
the
delight
of
jerry
who
provided
that
they
fought
was
quite
indifferent
which
party
was
the
victor
but
a
fortunate
interruption
took
place
by
the
appearance
of
the
nine
gentlemen
if
you
please
the
lights
must
be
put
out
very
well
replied
one
of
the
oldsters
the
took
his
seat
on
a
chest
close
to
the
door
of
the
berth
aware
that
a
second
summons
if
not
a
third
would
be
requisite
before
his
object
was
obtained
in
a
few
minutes
he
again
put
his
head
into
the
berth
nine
gentlemen

you

the
midshipman

him
out
a
will

the
black

the
politeness
to
drink
the
health
of
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
berth
separately
before
he
poured
the
liquor
down
his
throat
massa

mr

honour
mr
pitt
ten
per
cent
massa
bruce
continued
billy
grinning
ten
per
cent
is
the
bargain
i
go
see
another
quart
bottle
made
its
appearance
and
the
agent
having
received
his
commission
made
his
bow
and
returned
to
his
hammock
i
do
really
think
upon
my
word
that
that
black
scoundrel
would
sell
his
own
mother
for
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
observed
a
youngster
of
the
name
of
prose
a
cockney
who
drawled
out
his
words
which
like
a
wounded
snake
dragged
their
slow
length
along
the
lights
gentlemen
if
you
please
resumed
the
putting
his
head
again
into
the
door
another
commission
said
jerry
a
tax
upon
light
billy
pitt
has
the
best
right
to
it
a
second
glass
of
grog
was
poured
out
and
the
bribe
disappeared
down
mr
byfield
gullet
now
we
put
the
light
out
said
one
of
the
oldsters
covering
the
candlestick
with
a
hat
if
you
will
put
your
candle
into
my
lantern
observed
the
obsequious
i
can
then
report
the
lights
out
of
course
you
will
allow
it
to
remain
there
the
suggestion
was
adopted
and
the
light
was
reported
to
the
at
the
very
moment
that
it
was
taken
of
the
lantern
again
and
replaced
in
the
candlestick
the
duplicate
supply
began
to
have
its
effect
upon
our
incipient
heroes
who
commenced
talking
their
bruce
a
fine
manly
honourable
scotchman
had
the
peculiarity
of
always
allying
himself
when
half
drunk
to
the
royal
house
who
formerly
sat
upon
the
throne
of
england
but
when
quite
intoxicated
he
was
so
treasonable
as
to
declare
himself
the
lawful
king
of
great
britain
glass
after
glass
increased
his
propinquity
to
the
throne
till
at
last
he
seated
himself
on
it
and
the
uproar
of
the
whole
party
rose
to
that
height
that
the
sent
out
desiring
the
midshipmen
immediately
to
retire
to
their
hammocks
send
me
to
bed
man
dressed
in
a
little
brief
authority
if
the
lord
anointed
had
been
respected
he
with
millions
would
be
now
bending
the
knee
to
me
well
if
i
ca
be
king
of
all
england
at
least
i
be
king
in
this
berth
tell
me
cried
bruce
seizing
the
unfortunate
prose
by
the
collar
am
i
not
king
why
according
to
the
best
of
my
belief
said
prose
i
should
rather
be
inclined
to
think
that
you
are
not
the
king
am
not
base
slave
cried
bruce
throwing
him
on
the
deck
and
putting
his
foot
on
his
chest
no
if
i
die
for
it
i
do
care
but
if
you
are
not
king
i
must
own
that
you
are
one
of
my
thirty
tyrants
drawled
out
prose
half
suffocated
with
the
pressure
i
do
declare
cried
jerry
imitating
prose
drawl
that
he
has
squeezed
a
pun
out
of
you
am
not
i
king
resumed
bruce
seizing
jerry
who
had
advanced
within
reach
to
laugh
at
prose
i
feel
that
you
ought
to
be
replied
jerry
and
i
do
doubt
your
lineal
descent
for
you
have
all
the
dispositions
of
the
race
from
which
you
claim
descent
a
boon
your
gracious
majesty
continued
jerry
bending
on
one
knee
thou
shalt
have
it
my
loyal
subject
replied
bruce
who
was
delighted
with
the
homage
even
as
ahasuerus
said
to
esther
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
god
forbid
that
i
should
deprive
your
majesty
of
that
replied
jerry
smiling
at
the
idea
of
it
is
only
to
request
that
i
may
not
keep
the
middle
watch
rise
jerry
you
shall
not
keep
a
for
a
fortnight
i
humbly
thank
your
most
gracious
majesty
replied
the
astute
boy
who
was
a
youngster
of
the
watch
of
which
bruce
was
mate
as
the
reader
may
be
amused
with
the
result
of
this
promise
he
must
know
that
bruce
who
did
not
recollect
what
had
passed
when
he
perceived
jerry
not
to
be
on
deck
sent
down
for
him
the
youngster
on
his
appearance
claimed
his
promise
and
his
claim
was
allowed
by
bruce
rather
than
he
would
acknowledge
himself
to
have
been
intoxicated
jerry
upon
the
strength
of
the
agreement
continued
for
more
than
the
prescribed
time
to
sleep
in
every
until
aware
that
he
was
no
longer
safe
he
thought
of
an
expedient
which
would
probably
insure
him
one
night
longer
and
prevent
a
disagreeable
interruption
of
his
dreams
prose
whose
hammock
was
hung
up
next
the
hatchway
had
a
bad
cold
and
jerry
thought
it
prudent
to
shift
his
berth
that
he
might
not
be
found
it
the
draught
from
the
hatchway
that
makes
your
cold
so
bad
prose
you
never
get
well
while
you
sleep
there
i
will
give
you
my
inside
berth
until
it
is
better
is
really
quite
distressing
to
hear
you
cough
well
now
jerry
that
what
i
call
very
of
you
i
have
not
had
such
a
friendly
act
done
towards
me
since
i
joined
the
ship
and
i
do
assure
you
jerry
that
i
shall
not
be
ungrateful
i
shall
not
forget
it
it
happened
that
on
the
very
night
that
prose
exchanged
berths
with
jerry
bruce
made
his
calculation
that
the
fortnight
had
elapsed
three
days
back
and
although
he
felt
himself
bound
in
honour
to
keep
his
promise
yet
feeling
rather
sore
at
being
he
now
ordered
the
to
cut
jerry
hammock
down
by
the
head
this
was
supposed
to
be
done
and
poor
prose
who
had
just
fallen
asleep
after
keeping
the
previous
watch
awoke
with
a
stunning
sensation
and
found
his
feet
up
at
the
beams
and
his
head
on
the
deck
while
jerry
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
noise
was
obliged
to
cram
the
sheets
into
his
mouth
that
his
laughter
might
be
unperceived
well
now
i
do
declare
this
is
too
bad
i
most
certainly
will
complain
to
the
captain
morning
as
sure
as
my
name
is
prose
sentry
bring
me
a
light
and
assist
me
to
get
my
hammock
up
again
i
will
not
put
up
with
this
treatment
i
do
declare
and
so
saying
prose
once
more
resumed
his
position
in
his
precarious
dormitory
but
during
our
digression
the
berth
has
become
empty
some
walking
and
others
particularly
his
majesty
reeling
to
bed
so
we
shall
close
this
chapter
from
which
the
reader
may
perceive
that
even
in
the
ships
there
is
more
going
on
in
a
midshipmen
berth
than
a
captain
is
acquainted
with
or
that
comes
between
heaven
and
his
philosophy
chapter
twenty
one
with
leave
bassanio
i
am
half
yourself
and
i
must
freely
have
the
half
of
anything
that
this
same
paper
brings
you
shakespeare
the
castle
which
had
been
built
by
the
ancestors
of
mr
rainscourt
and
which
in
feudal
times
had
been
one
of
strength
and
importance
was
about
two
miles
from
the
town
of
in
the
county
of
galway
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
and
as
mr
rainscourt
had
correctly
surmised
when
he
returned
to
it
no
officer
could
be
found
who
was
bold
enough
to
venture
his
life
by
an
attempt
at
caption
surrounded
as
he
was
by
a
savage
and
devoted
peasantry
who
had
no
scruples
at
bloodshed
immured
within
its
walls
with
little
to
interest
and
no
temptation
to
expend
money
mr
and
mrs
rainscourt
lived
for
nearly
two
years
indulging
their
spleen
and
discontent
in
mutual
upbraidings
their
feelings
towards
each
other
from
incessant
irritation
being
now
rather
those
of
hatred
than
any
other
term
that
could
be
applied
the
jewels
of
mrs
rainscourt
and
every
other
article
that
could
be
dispensed
with
had
been
sold
and
the
purse
was
empty
the
of
the
tenants
of
the
mortgaged
property
had
for
some
time
supplied
the
couple
with
the
necessaries
of
life
every
day
added
to
their
wants
to
their
hatred
and
their
despair
they
were
seated
at
the
table
having
finished
a
dinner
off
some
game
which
mr
rainscourt
had
procured
with
his
gun
and
which
had
been
their
fare
with
little
variety
ever
since
the
shooting
season
had
commenced
when
the
old
nurse
the
only
domestic
they
retained
probably
the
only
one
who
would
remain
with
them
without
receiving
wages
made
her
appearance
and
sure
there
a
letter
for
the
master
barney
the
is
just
bringing
it
well
where
is
it
replied
rainscourt
he
says
that
it
two
thirteens
that
must
be
paid
for
it
and
the
dirty
spalpeen
of
a
postmaster
told
him
not
to
give
you
the
letter
without
the
money
for
it
in
his
fist
tell
barney
to
step
in
here
have
you
two
shillings
mrs
rainscourt
not
one
mr
rainscourt
replied
the
lady
gloomily
the
nurse
reappeared
with
barney
well
barney
where
the
letter
said
mr
rainscourt
let
me
look
at
it
sure
your
honour
it
not
me
that
refusing
it
ye
but
the
master
tould
me
says
he
you
give
his
honour
the
letter
without
the
two
thirteens
in
your
fist
it
a
good
bating
that
i
give
ye
when
ye
come
back
well
but
barney
let
me
look
at
it
and
see
by
the
postmark
where
it
from
i
shall
know
directly
whether
i
will
take
it
up
or
not
and
suppose
that
your
honour
should
wish
to
open
the
letter
it
not
for
gentlemen
like
ye
to
be
standing
against
the
temptation
and
then
the
two
thirteens
your
honour
well
barney
since
you
wo
trust
me
and
i
have
no
money
you
must
take
the
letter
back
it
might
bring
me
good
news
i
have
had
nothing
but
bad
of
late
and
sure
enough
it
might
bring
you
good
news
then
your
honour
shall
take
the
letter
and
i
take
the
and
the
lad
pulled
out
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
rainscourt
rainscourt
who
first
wished
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
one
of
his
usual
dunning
correspondents
examined
the
and
handwriting
of
the
superscription
that
he
might
return
it
unopened
and
save
poor
barney
from
the
beating
which
he
had
volunteered
to
receive
for
his
sake
but
the
hand
was
unknown
to
him
and
the
was
so
faint
and
illegible
that
he
could
not
decipher
it
he
looked
into
the
sides
of
the
letter
and
the
few
words
which
he
could
read
whetted
his
curiosity
i
afraid
barney
that
i
must
open
it
good
luck
to
your
honour
then
and
may
it
prove
so
the
letter
was
opened
and
the
contents
threw
a
gleam
of
pleasure
which
had
been
rarely
seen
of
late
on
the
brow
of
the
reader
his
wife
had
watched
his
countenance
barney
cried
rainscourt
with
delight
call
and
i
give
you
a
guinea
sure
your
honour
in
luck
and
me
too
replied
barney
grinning
and
backing
out
of
the
room
i
go
take
my
bating
at
once
but
to
explain
the
contents
of
this
letter
we
must
narrate
events
of
which
we
have
lost
sight
in
following
up
the
naval
career
of
our
hero
about
three
weeks
after
the
death
of
admiral
de
courcy
the
ship
in
which
old
adams
had
sailed
with
our
hero
under
his
protection
returned
into
port
the
vicar
who
anxiously
awaited
her
arrival
immediately
proceeded
there
that
he
might
claim
willy
in
the
capacity
of
his
guardian
having
obtained
the
address
of
captain
m
he
called
upon
him
and
opened
his
case
by
requesting
that
the
boy
might
be
permitted
to
come
on
shore
he
was
proceeding
to
narrate
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
his
ward
prospects
when
he
was
interrupted
by
captain
m
who
first
detailing
the
death
of
old
adams
and
the
conduct
of
willy
stated
that
he
had
sent
the
boy
home
in
the
prize
for
an
outfit
it
was
with
great
feeling
that
captain
m
was
forced
to
add
the
apparent
certainty
that
the
vessel
which
had
never
been
heard
of
had
foundered
at
sea
shocked
at
the
intelligence
which
was
communicated
at
a
moment
when
his
heart
was
expanded
at
the
idea
of
having
been
instrumental
in
repairing
the
injustice
and
neglect
which
had
been
shown
towards
his
the
vicar
not
caring
to
mention
to
a
stranger
the
family
particulars
upon
which
his
request
had
been
grounded
withdrew
without
even
giving
his
name
or
address
three
years
afterwards
when
as
we
have
narrated
our
hero
again
made
his
appearance
captain
m
had
no
clue
to
guide
him
by
which
he
might
communicate
the
intelligence
of
his
recovery
to
one
whom
he
naturally
concluded
did
not
make
such
inquiries
without
having
some
interest
in
our
hero
welfare
the
vicar
in
the
mean
time
although
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
willy
was
no
more
resorted
to
every
means
that
his
prudence
could
suggest
to
ascertain
the
positive
fact
for
many
months
the
most
strict
inquiries
were
set
afloat
by
his
agents
whether
a
captured
vessel
had
been
wrecked
on
the
french
coast
the
prisoners
at
verdun
and
other
depots
were
examined
rewards
were
offered
by
emissaries
in
france
for
the
discovery
of
the
boy
but
without
success
having
waited
two
years
all
hope
became
extinct
and
the
letter
now
received
by
mr
rainscourt
was
from
the
vicar
acquainting
him
with
the
circumstances
and
surrendering
up
the
property
to
him
as
next
of
kin
pray
mr
rainscourt
may
i
ask
the
contents
of
a
letter
the
perusal
of
which
not
only
makes
you
so
generous
but
implies
that
you
expect
to
have
the
means
of
being
so
when
happy
ourselves
especially
when
unexpectedly
so
we
feel
kindly
disposed
towards
others
for
a
moment
rainscourt
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
his
differences
with
his
wife
and
he
as
readily
imparted
to
her
his
good
fortune
as
he
had
on
a
previous
occasion
his
disappointment
my
dear
clara
the
grandchild
is
dead
and
we
have
possession
of
the
property
my
dear
clara
such
an
epithet
had
never
been
used
since
the
first
week
of
their
marriage
overcome
by
the
joyful
intelligence
but
more
overcome
by
the
kind
expression
of
her
husband
which
recalled
the
days
when
she
fondly
loved
mrs
rainscourt
burst
into
tears
and
throwing
herself
down
with
her
face
on
his
knees
poured
out
in
sobs
her
gratitude
to
heaven
and
her
revived
affection
for
her
husband
their
daughter
emily
now
ten
years
old
astonished
at
so
unusual
a
scene
ran
up
impelled
as
it
were
by
instinct
and
completed
the
family
group
by
clinging
to
her
father
rainscourt
who
was
affected
kissed
the
brow
of
the
child
and
congratulated
her
on
becoming
an
heiress
i
never
knew
before
that
money
would
do
so
much
good
observed
the
child
referring
to
the
apparent
reconciliation
of
her
parents
mrs
rainscourt
rose
from
her
position
and
sat
down
at
the
table
leaning
her
face
upon
her
hands
i
am
afraid
that
it
has
come
too
late
said
she
mournfully
as
she
recalled
the
years
of
indifference
and
hostility
which
had
preceded
mrs
rainscourt
was
correct
in
her
supposition
respect
and
esteem
had
long
departed
and
without
their
aid
truant
love
was
not
to
be
reclaimed
the
feeling
of
renewed
attachment
was
as
transient
as
it
was
sudden
i
must
be
off
to
england
immediately
observed
the
husband
i
presume
that
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
money
from
the
bank
when
i
show
this
letter
old
will
be
ready
enough
to
thrust
his
notes
into
my
hands
now
shall
we
not
go
with
you
mr
rainscourt
no
you
had
better
remain
here
till
i
have
arranged
matters
a
little
i
must
settle
with
three
cursed
and
take
up
the
bonds
from
j
little
scoundrel
he
be
civil
enough
well
mr
rainscourt
it
must
i
suppose
be
as
you
decide
but
neither
emily
nor
i
are
very
well
equipped
in
our
wardrobes
and
you
will
not
be
exactly
competent
to
execute
our
commissions
and
therefore
shall
execute
none
do
you
then
mean
to
leave
us
here
in
rags
and
beggary
while
you
are
amusing
yourself
in
london
replied
mrs
rainscourt
with
asperity
with
your
altered
circumstances
you
will
have
no
want
of
society
either
male
or
continued
the
lady
with
an
emphasis
upon
the
last
word
and
a
wife
will
probably
be
an
encumbrance
certainly
not
such
a
kind
and
affectionate
one
as
you
have
proved
my
dear
replied
the
gentleman
sarcastically
nevertheless
i
must
decline
the
pleasure
of
your
company
till
i
have
time
to
look
about
me
a
little
perhaps
mr
rainscourt
now
that
you
will
be
able
to
afford
it
you
will
prefer
a
separate
establishment
if
so
i
am
willing
to
accede
to
any
proposition
you
may
be
inclined
to
make
that
a
very
sensible
remark
of
yours
my
dear
and
shall
receive
due
consideration
the
sooner
the
better
sir
replied
the
piqued
lady
as
mr
rainscourt
quitted
the
room
my
dear
child
said
mrs
rainscourt
to
her
daughter
you
see
how
cruelly
your
father
treats
me
he
is
a
bad
man
and
you
must
never
pay
attention
to
what
he
says
papa
told
me
just
the
same
of
you
mamma
replied
the
girl
yesterday
morning
when
you
were
walking
in
the
garden
did
he
the
wretch
to
set
my
own
child
against
me
cried
mrs
rainscourt
who
had
just
been
guilty
of
the
very
same
offence
which
had
raised
her
choler
against
her
husband
chapter

vast
command

and
half
the
land
and
over
moist
and
crazy
brains
in
high
at
midnight
reigns
hudibras
among
the
millions
who
on
the
hallowed
and
appointed
day
lay
aside
their
worldly
occupations
to
bow
the
knee
to
the
giver
of
all
good
directing
their
orisons
and
their
thoughts
to
one
power
like
so
many
rays
of
light
concentrated
into
one
focus
i
know
no
class
of
people
in
whose
breasts
the
feeling
of
religion
is
more
deeply
implanted
than
the
occupants
of
that
glorious
specimen
of
daring
ingenuity
a
it
is
through
his
works
that
the
almighty
is
most
sincerely
reverenced
through
them
that
his
infinite
power
is
with
deepest
humility
acknowledged
the
most
forcible
arguments
the
most
pathetic
eloquence
from
the
pulpit
will
not
affect
so
powerfully
the
mind
of
man
as
the
investigation
of
a
blade
of
grass
or
the
mechanism
of
the
almost
imperceptible
insect
if
then
such
is
the
effect
upon
mankind
in
general
how
strong
must
be
the
impressions
of
those
who
occupy
their
business
in
the
great
waters
these
men
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
they
behold
him
in
all
his
magnificence
in
all
his
beauty
in
all
his
wrath
in
all
his
vastness
in
all
his
variety
unassisted
by
theory
they
practically
feel
that
god
is
great
and
their
worship
although
dumb
is
sincere
i
am
aware
that
it
is
the
idea
of
many
that
sailors
have
little
or
no
religion
and
their
dissolute
conduct
when
thrown
on
shore
is
certainly
a
strong
argument
in
support
of
this
opinion
but
they
must
not
be
so
partially
judged
those
who
are
constantly
mixed
with
the
world
and
exposed
to
its
allurements
are
subject
to
a
continual
struggle
against
their
passions
which
they
are
more
enabled
to
restrain
as
temptation
so
rapidly
succeeds
temptation
that
one
destroys
the
other
effacing
it
from
their
recollection
before
they
have
had
time
to
mature
their
embryo
guilt
but
in
our
floating
monasteries
where
rigid
discipline
and
active
duties
allow
only
the
thoughts
to
ramble
to
that
society
which
never
has
been
intended
to
be
abandoned
the
passions
are
naturally
impelled
towards
that
world
whose
temptations
are
so
much
increased
by
long
and
unnatural
seclusion
in
the
mountain
lake
whose
waters
are
daily
increasing
all
is
unruffled
till
their
own
weight
has
forced
its
boundaries
and
the
roaring
cataract
sweeps
everything
before
it
such
is
the
licentious
and
impetuous
behaviour
of
the
sailor
on
shore
but
on
board
he
is
a
different
being
and
appears
as
if
he
were
without
sin
and
without
guile
let
those
then
who
turn
away
at
his
occasional
intemperance
be
careful
how
they
judge
they
may
thank
god
that
they
are
not
as
that
publican
and
yet
be
less
justified
when
weighed
in
that
balance
where
although
justice
eyes
the
beam
mercy
is
permitted
to
stand
by
and
throw
into
the
scale
her
thousand
little
grains
to
the
mass
of
guilt
religion
in
a
sailor
i
mean
by
the
term
a
common
seaman
is
more
of
an
active
than
a
passive
feeling
it
does
not
consist
in
reflection
or
it
is
in
externals
that
his
respect
to
the
deity
is
manifest
witness
the
sunday
on
board
of
a
the
care
with
which
the
decks
are
washed
the
hauling
taut
and
neat
coiling
down
of
the
ropes
the
studied
cleanliness
of
person
most
of
which
duties
are
performed
on
other
days
but
on
this
day
are
executed
with
an
extra
precision
and
attention
on
the
part
of
the
seamen
because
it
is
then
the
quiet
decorum
voluntarily
observed
the
attention
to
divine
service
which
would
be
a
pattern
to
a
congregation
on
shore
the
little
knots
of
men
collected
in
the
afternoon
between
the
guns
listening
to
one
who
reads
some
serious
book
or
the
solitary
poring
over
his
thumbed
testament
as
he
communes
with
himself
all
prove
that
sailors
have
a
feeling
of
religion
i
once
knew
a
receive
a
severe
rebuke
from
a
company
this
officer
observing
the
men
scattered
listlessly
about
the
forecastle
and
waist
of
the
frigate
on
a
fine
sunday
evening
ordered
the
fiddler
up
that
they
might
dance
the
ship
company
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
but
stated
that
they
had
not
been
accustomed
to
dance
on
that
day
and
requested
that
the
music
might
be
sent
below
the
sunday
on
board
a
has
another
advantage
over
the
sabbath
on
shore
it
is
hallowed
throughout
it
commences
with
respect
and
reverence
and
it
ends
with
the
same
there
is
no
alehouse
to
resort
to
where
the
men
may
become
intoxicated
no
allurements
of
the
senses
to
disturb
the
calm
repose
of
the
mind
the
practical
veneration
of
the
day
which
bestows
upon
it
a
moral
beauty
it
was
on
the
evening
of
such
a
day
of
serenity
after
the
hammocks
had
been
piped
down
and
the
watch
mustered
that
captain
m
was
standing
on
the
gangway
of
the
in
conversation
with
macallan
the
surgeon
it
was
almost
a
calm
the
sails
were
not
with
the
light
airs
that
occasionally
distended
them
but
flapped
against
the
lofty
masts
with
the
motion
communicated
to
the
vessel
by
the
undulating
wave
the
moon
nearly
at
her
full
was
high
in
the
heavens
steering
for
the
zenith
in
all
her
beauty
without
one
envious
cloud
to
obscure
the
refulgence
of
her
beams
which
were
reflected
upon
the
water
in
broad
and
wavering
lines
of
silver
the
blue
wave
was
of
a
deeper
blue
so
clear
and
so
transparent
that
you
fancied
you
could
pierce
through
a
fathomless
perspective
and
so
refreshing
so
void
of
all
impurity
that
it
invited
you
to
glide
into
its
bosom
how
clear
the
moon
shines
i
think
will
be
full
moon
it
would
be
well
observed
the
surgeon
in
reply
to
remark
of
the
captain
to
request
the
officer
of
the
watch
to
permit
the
men
to
sleep
on
the
upper
deck
we
shall
have
many
of
them
i
have
often
heard
that
effect
of
the
moon
in
the
tropics
mentioned
but
have
never
seen
it
in
what
manner
does
it
affect
the
eyes
the
moon
can
act
but
in
one
way
sir
replied
macallan
by
attraction
the
men
who
are
affected
see
perfectly
well
in
broad
daylight
but
as
soon
as
it
is
dusk
their
powers
of
vision
are
gone
altogether
at
the
usual
time
at
which
the
hammocks
are
piped
down
they
will
not
be
able
to
distinguish
the
numbers
i
have
had
sixty
men
in
one
ship
in
the
situation
i
have
described
we
ridicule
the
opinion
of
the
ancients
relative
to
the
powers
of
this
planet
observed
the
captain
but
at
the
same
time
i
have
often
heard
more
ascribed
to
her
influence
than
the
world
in
general
are
inclined
to
credit
that
she
regulates
the
tides
is
i
believe
the
only
point
upon
which
there
is
now
no
scepticism
there
has
been
scepticism
even
upon
that
sir
did
you
ever
read
a
work
entitled
of
the
tides
i
can
however
state
some
other
points
from
observation
in
which
the
moon
has
power
over
lunatics
i
presume
most
certainly
and
why
not
therefore
over
those
who
are
rational
we
observe
the
effect
more
clearly
in
the
lunatic
because
his
mind
is
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
but
if
the
moon
can
act
upon
the
diseased
brain
it
must
also
have
power
although
less
perceptible
over
the
mind
which
is
in
health
i
believe
that
there
is
an
ebb
and
flow
of
power
in
our
internal
mechanism
corresponding
to
the
phases
of
the
moon
i
mean
that
the
blood
flows
more
rapidly
and
the
powers
of
nature
are
more
stimulated
at
the
flood
and
full
than
at
the
ebb
and
neap
when
a
reaction
takes
place
in
proportion
to
the
previous
acceleration
dr
mead
has
observed
that
of
those
who
are
at
the
point
of
death
nine
out
of
ten
quit
this
world
at
the
ebb
of
the
tide
does
not
this
observation
suggest
the
idea
that
nature
has
relaxed
her
efforts
during
that
period
after
having
been
stimulated
during
the
flood
shakespeare
who
was
a
true
observer
of
nature
has
not
omitted
this
circumstance
speaking
of
the
death
of
falstaff
mrs
quickly
observes
was
just
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
well
but
mr
macallan
laying
aside
hypothesis
what
have
you
ascertained
from
actual
observation
besides
that
which
we
term
the
effect
of
the
moon
upon
fish
and
other
animal
matter
hung
up
in
its
rays
at
night
if
under
the
they
would
remain
perfectly
sweet
and
eatable
but
if
exposed
to
the
moon
rays
in
the
tropics
they
will
in
the
course
of
one
night
become
putrid
and
unwholesome
they
emit
no
smell
but
when
eaten
will
produce
diarrhoea
almost
as
violent
as
if
you
had
taken
poison
i
have
heard
that
stated
also
by
seamen
said
the
captain
but
have
never
witnessed
it
a
remarkable
and
corroborative
instance
occurred
when
i
was
in
the
bay
of
annapolis
resumed
the
surgeon
i
was
becalmed
in
a
small
vessel
and
amused
myself
with
fishing
i
pulled
up
several
herrings
but
to
my
astonishment
they
were
putrid
and
sodden
an
hour
or
two
after
they
were
dead
i
observed
the
circumstance
to
one
of
the
fishermen
who
in
formed
me
that
several
hundred
barrels
taken
at
a
fishery
a
few
miles
off
had
all
been
spoiled
in
the
same
manner
i
asked
the
reason
and
the
answer
was
they
had
been
spawned
at
the
full
of
the
moon
how
far
the
man
was
correct
i
know
not
but
he
stated
that
the
circumstance
had
occurred
before
and
was
well
known
to
the
older
fishermen
very
singular
replied
captain
m
we
are
too
apt
to
reject
the
whole
because
we
have
found
a
part
to
be
erroneous
that
the
moon
is
not
the
hecate
formerly
supposed
i
believe
but
she
seems
to
have
more
power
than
is
usually
ascribed
to
her
is
that
seven
bells
striking
it
is
sir
the
time
has
slipped
rapidly
away
i
shall
wish
you
good
night
good
night
replied
captain
m
who
for
some
time
after
the
departure
of
the
surgeon
continued
leaning
over
the
rail
of
the
in
silent
contemplation
of
the
glassy
wave
until
the
working
of
his
mind
was
expressed
in
the
following
apostrophe
yes
placid
and
beautiful
as
thou
art
there
is
foul
treachery
in
thy
smile
who
knows
but
that
one
day
thou
mayest
in
thy
fury
demand
as
a
victim
the
form
which
thou
so
peaceably
reflectest
epicure
thou
must
be
fed
with
the
healthy
and
the
brave
the
gluttonous
earth
preys
indiscriminately
upon
the
diseased
carcases
of
age
infancy
and
manhood
but
thou
must
be
more
daintily
supplied
health
and
vigour
prime
of
life
and
joyous
heart
pulse
and
energy
of
soul
active
bodies
and
more
active
minds
such
is
the
food
in
which
thou
delightest
and
with
such
dainty
fare
wilt
thou
ever
be
supplied
until
the
power
that
created
thee
with
the
other
elements
shall
order
thee
to
pass
away
the
bell
struck
eight
and
its
sharp
peals
followed
by
the
hoarse
summoning
of
the
watch
below
by
the
disturbed
his
reverie
and
captain
m
descended
to
his
cabin
and
now
reader
i
shall
finish
this
chapter
you
may
perhaps
imagine
that
i
have
the
scene
before
me
and
am
describing
from
nature
if
so
you
are
in
error
i
am
seated
in
the
of
a
vessel
endowed
with
as
liberal
a
share
of
motion
as
any
in
his
majesty
service
whilst
i
write
i
am
holding
on
by
the
table
my
legs
entwined
in
the
lashings
underneath
and
i
can
barely
manage
to
keep
my
position
before
my
manuscript
the
sea
is
high
the
gale
fresh
the
sky
dirty
and
threatening
a
continuance
of
what
our
transatlantic
descendants
would
term
a
blast
of
wind
the
are
on
deck
the
masts
are
struck
the
guns
and
the
bulwarks
creaking
and
grinding
in
most
detestable
regularity
of
dissonance
as
the
vessel
scuds
and
lurches
through
a
cross
and
heavy
sea
the
is
afloat
and
from
the
careless
fitting
of
the
at
the
dockyard
and
neglect
of
caulking
in
the
cants
my
is
in
the
same
predicament
a
bubbling
brook
changing
its
course
ebbing
and
flowing
as
it
were
with
the
rolling
of
the
ship
is
dashing
with
mimic
fury
against
the
trunks
secured
on
each
side
of
the
cabin
i
have
just
been
summoned
from
my
task
in
consequence
of
one
of
the
battens
which
secured
my
little
library
having
given
way
to
the
immoderate
weight
of
learning
that
pressed
upon
it
and
as
my
books
have
been
washed
to
and
fro
i
have
snatched
them
from
their
first
attempts
at
natation
smith
wealth
of
nations
i
picked
up
first
not
worth
don
juan
i
have
just
rescued
from
a
second
shipwreck
with
no
other
haidee
to
console
him
than
the
melancholy
one
extracted
from
me
with
a
deep
sigh
as
i
received
his
shattered
frame
here
burton
anatomy
of
melancholy
in
a
very
melancholy
plight
indeed
and
what
a
fashionable
my
cabin
has
turned
to
here
burke
peerage
with
all
the
royal
family
and
aristocracy
of
the
kingdom
taking
a
dip
and
a
captain
of
a
like
another
sally
gunn
pulling
them
out
so
you
perceive
my
description
has
been
all
moonshine
my
wishes
have
been
fathers
to
my
thoughts
my
bones
are
sore
with
rocking
horace
says
that
he
had
a
soul
of
brass
who
first
ventured
to
sea
i
think
a
body
of
iron
very
necessary
to
the
outfit
my
cot
is
swinging
and
jerking
up
to
the
beams
as
if
the
lively
scoundrel
was
some
metamorphosed
imp
mocking
at
me
sarve
you
right
what
did
you
for
very
true
why
did
i
well
anxious
as
i
am
to
close
this
chapter
and
to
close
my
eyes
i
will
tell
you
reader
what
it
was
that
induced
me
to
go
to
sea
it
was
not
to
escape
the
drudgery
and
confinement
of
a
school
or
the
admonitions
received
at
home
the
battle
of
trafalgar
had
been
fought
i
recollect
the
news
being
brought
down
by
the
when
i
was
at
school
but
although
i
knew
that
eighteen
or
twenty
sail
of
the
line
had
been
captured
yet
never
having
seen
a
vessel
larger
than
a
merchant
ship
at
london
bridge
i
had
very
imperfect
ideas
on
the
subject
except
that
it
must
have
been
a
very
glorious
affair
as
we
had
a
whole
holiday
in
consequence
but
when
i
returned
home
i
witnessed
the
funeral
procession
of
lord
nelson
and
as
the
triumphal
car
upon
which
his
earthly
remains
were
borne
disappeared
from
my
aching
eye
i
felt
that
death
could
have
no
terrors
if
followed
by
such
a
funeral
and
i
determined
that
i
would
be
buried
in
the
same
manner
this
is
the
fact
but
i
am
not
now
exactly
of
the
same
opinion
i
had
no
idea
at
that
time
that
it
was
such
a
terrible
roundabout
way
to
paul
here
i
have
been
tossed
about
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
for
between
twenty
and
years
and
the
dome
is
almost
as
distant
as
ever
i
mean
to
put
up
with
the
family
vault
but
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
engraved
on
my
coffin
many
years
commissioner
or
lord
of
the
admiralty
or
governor
of
greenwich
hospital
ambassador
privy
councillor
or
in
fact
anything
but
captain
for
though
acknowledged
to
be
a
good
travelling
name
it
is
a
very
insignificant
title
at
the
end
of
our
journey
moreover
as
the
author
of
pelham
says
i
wish
somebody
would
adopt
me
chapter
twenty
three
when
his
pockets
were
lined
why
his
life
should
be
mended
the
laws
he
had
broken
he
never
break
more
sea
song
on
his
return
to
london
mcelvina
immediately
repaired
to
the
residence
of
his
patron
that
he
might
enter
into
the
necessary
explanations
relative
to
the
capture
of
the
vessel
and
the
circumstances
which
had
produced
his
release
from
the
penalties
and
imprisonment
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
by
his
lawless
career
previous
however
to
narrating
the
events
which
occurred
upon
his
arrival
it
will
be
advisable
to
offer
some
remarks
relative
to
mcelvina
which
when
they
have
been
suggested
to
the
reader
will
serve
to
remove
much
of
the
apparent
inconsistency
of
his
character
that
a
person
who
from
his
earliest
childhood
had
been
brought
up
to
fraud
and
deceit
should
of
his
own
accord
and
so
suddenly
return
to
honesty
may
at
first
appear
problematical
but
let
it
be
remembered
that
mcelvina
was
not
in
the
situation
of
those
who
having
their
choice
of
good
and
evil
had
preferred
the
latter
from
infancy
he
had
been
brought
up
to
and
had
heard
every
encomium
upon
dishonesty
without
having
one
friend
to
point
out
to
him
the
advantages
of
pursuing
another
course
the
same
spirit
of
emulation
which
would
have
made
him
strenuous
in
the
right
path
urged
him
forward
in
his
career
of
error
if
after
his
discharge
from
the
philanthropic
school
he
had
had
time
to
observe
the
advantages
in
practice
of
those
maxims
which
had
only
been
inculcated
in
theory
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
might
have
reformed
this
however
was
prevented
by
the
injudicious
conduct
of
his
master
but
although
the
principles
which
had
been
instilled
were
not
sufficiently
powerful
unassisted
by
reflection
to
resist
the
force
of
habit
the
germ
smothered
as
it
was
for
the
time
was
not
destroyed
and
after
mcelvina
seven
years
servitude
in
a
profession
remarkable
for
candour
and
sincerity
and
in
which
he
had
neither
temptation
nor
opportunity
to
return
to
his
evil
courses
habit
had
been
counteracted
by
habit
the
tares
and
wheat
were
of
equal
growth
this
is
substantiated
by
the
single
fact
of
his
inclination
to
be
honest
when
he
found
the
a
confirmed
rogue
would
never
have
thought
of
returning
it
even
if
it
had
not
been
worth
five
shillings
it
is
true
if
it
had
contained
hundreds
that
in
his
distressed
circumstances
the
temptation
might
have
been
too
strong
but
this
remark
by
no
means
disproves
the
assertion
that
he
had
the
inclination
to
be
honest
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
and
it
was
on
this
decision
between
retaining
or
returning
the
that
depended
the
future
misery
or
welfare
of
mcelvina
fortunately
the
sum
was
not
sufficient
to
turn
the
nicely
balanced
scale
and
the
generosity
of
old
hornblow
confirmed
the
victory
on
the
side
of
virtue
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
for
some
time
subsequent
to
this
transaction
mcelvina
was
influenced
by
a
religious
or
even
a
moral
feeling
it
was
rather
by
interested
motives
that
he
was
convinced
but
convinced
he
was
and
whether
he
was
proud
of
his
return
to
comparative
virtue
or
found
it
necessary
to
refresh
his
memory
his
constant
injunctions
to
others
to
be
honest
upon
the
same
principle
that
a
man
who
tells
a
story
repeatedly
eventually
believes
it
to
be
true
assisted
to
keep
him
steadfast
in
his
good
resolutions
upon
the
other
points
of
his
character
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
dilate
for
his
gentlemanly
appearance
and
address
he
was
indebted
to
nature
who
does
not
always
choose
to
acknowledge
the
claims
which
aristocracy
thinks
proper
to
assert
and
occasionally
mocks
the
idea
by
bestowing
graces
on
a
cottager
which
might
be
envied
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
palace
of
mcelvina
it
may
with
justice
be
asserted
that
his
faults
were
those
of
education
his
courage
generosity
and
many
good
qualities
were
his
own
mcelvina
who
knew
exactly
at
what
hour
of
the
day
his
patron
would
be
abroad
took
the
precaution
of
not
going
to
the
house
until
the
time
at
which
he
would
be
certain
to
find
susan
as
usual
in
the
little
parlour
alone
and
occupied
with
her
needle
or
her
book
the
had
just
been
opened
by
the
maid
to
receive
some
articles
of
domestic
use
which
a
tradesman
had
sent
home
and
mcelvina
putting
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
ensure
the
silence
of
the
girl
who
would
have
run
to
communicate
the
welcome
intelligence
of
his
arrival
stepped
past
her
into
the
passage
and
found
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
gently
admitting
himself
he
discovered
susan
whom
he
had
not
disturbed
sitting
opposite
to
the
window
with
her
back
towards
him
he
crept
in
softly
behind
her
chair
she
was
in
deep
thought
one
hand
rested
on
her
cheek
and
the
other
held
the
pen
with
which
she
had
been
arranging
the
accounts
of
the
former
week
to
submit
them
as
usual
to
her
father
on
the
monday
evening
of
whom
and
what
she
was
thinking
was
however
soon
manifested
to
mcelvina
for
she
commenced
scribbling
and
drawing
with
her
pen
on
the
before
her
until
she
at
last
wrote
several
times
as
if
she
were
practising
to
see
how
it
would
look
as
a
signature
susan
mcelvina
susan
mcelvina
susan
mcelvina
although
delighted
at
this
proof
that
he
was
occupying
her
thoughts
mcelvina
had
the
delicacy
to
retire
unperceived
and
susan
as
if
recollecting
herself
slightly
coloured
as
she
twisted
up
the
paper
and
threw
it
under
the
grate
in
doing
which
she
perceived
mcelvina
who
still
remained
at
the
door
a
cry
of
surprise
a
deep
blush
of
pleasure
over
her
pale
face
and
a
hand
frankly
extended
which
mcelvina
could
with
difficulty
resist
the
impulse
to
raise
to
his
lips
were
followed
up
by
the
hasty
interrogation
of
why
your
arm
is
in
a
sling
you
did
not
say
that
you
were
hurt
when
you
wrote
from
plymouth
it
was
not
worth
mentioning
susan
it
almost
well
but
tell
me
how
did
your
father
bear
the
loss
of
the
vessel
oh
pretty
well
but
captain
mcelvina
you
could
not
have
done
me
a
greater
favour
or
my
father
a
greater
kindness
he
has
now
wound
up
his
affairs
and
intends
to
retire
from
all
speculation
he
has
purchased
a
house
in
the
country
and
i
hope
when
we
go
there
that
i
shall
be
more
happy
and
have
better
health
than
i
have
had
of
late
and
what
is
to
become
of
me
observed
mcelvina
gravely
oh
i
do
know
you
are
the
best
judge
of
that
well
then
i
will
confess
to
you
susan
that
i
am
just
as
well
pleased
that
all
this
has
taken
place
as
you
are
for
i
am
not
sorry
to
give
up
a
profession
respecting
which
between
ourselves
i
have
lately
had
many
scruples
of
conscience
i
have
not
saved
much
it
is
true
but
i
have
enough
to
live
upon
as
long
as
i
have
no
one
to
take
care
of
except
myself
you
raise
yourself
in
my
opinion
by
saying
so
replied
susan
although
it
is
painful
to
me
to
condemn
a
practice
which
impeaches
my
father
your
courage
and
talents
may
be
better
applied
thank
god
that
it
is
all
over
but
susan
you
said
that
you
hoped
to
have
better
health
have
you
not
been
well
not
very
ill
replied
susan
but
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
the
loss
of
the
vessel
your
capture
has
affected
my
father
and
of
course
has
worried
me
the
discourse
was
now
interrupted
by
old
hornblow
who
had
returned
home
to
his
dinner
he
received
mcelvina
in
the
most
friendly
manner
and
they
sat
down
to
table
after
dinner
mcelvina
entered
into
a
minute
detail
of
all
that
had
occurred
and
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
with
a
modesty
which
enhanced
his
meritorious
conduct
susan
listened
to
the
narrative
with
intense
interest
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
retired
to
her
room
leaving
old
hornblow
and
mcelvina
over
their
bottle
well
mcelvina
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
yourself
said
the
old
man
you
know
that
susan
has
at
last
persuaded
me
into
retiring
from
business
i
have
just
concluded
the
purchase
of
a
little
property
near
the
seaside
about
seven
miles
from
the
village
of
in
norfolk
it
adjoins
the
great
rainscourt
estate
you
know
that
part
of
the
coast
very
well
sir
there
is
a
famous
there
on
the
rainscourt
estate
it
was
formerly
the
property
of
admiral
de
courcy
ah
we
do
mean
to
smuggle
any
more
so
that
no
use
i
should
not
have
known
that
it
was
near
the
rainscourt
property
only
they
inserted
it
in
the
particulars
of
sale
as
an
advantage
though
i
confess
i
do
not
see
any
particular
advantage
in
a
poor
man
living
too
near
a
rich
one
but
answer
my
question
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
if
i
can
assist
you
mcelvina
i
will
i
do
not
intend
to
go
to
sea
any
more
no
what
then
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
marry
and
settle
on
shore
well
if
i
can
assist
you
mcelvina
i
will
you
could
indeed
assist
me
there
sir
oh
susan
i
suppose
nay
do
colour
up
i
seen
it
long
enough
and
if
i
had
not
meant
that
it
should
be
so
i
should
have
put
an
end
to
it
before
you
are
an
honest
man
mcelvina
and
i
know
nobody
to
whom
i
would
give
my
girl
sooner
than
to
you
you
have
indeed
removed
a
weight
from
my
mind
sir
and
i
hardly
know
how
to
express
my
thanks
to
you
for
your
good
wishes
but
i
have
yet
to
obtain
your
daughter
consent
i
know
you
have
you
can
not
expect
that
she
will
anticipate
your
wishes
as
i
have
done
but
as
i
wish
this
business
to
be
decided
at
once
i
shall
send
her
down
to
you
and
i
take
a
walk
in
the
mean
time
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
she
says
she
has
no
mind
to
you
do
you
believe
her
for
i
know
better
susan
said
old
hornblow
going
to
the
door
yes
father
come
down
my
dear
and
stay
with
captain
mcelvina
i
am
obliged
to
go
out
old
hornblow
reached
down
his
hat
put
on
his
spencer
and
departed
while
susan
whose
heart
told
her
that
so
unusual
a
movement
on
her
father
part
was
not
without
some
good
reason
descended
to
the
parlour
with
a
quickened
pulse
susan
said
mcelvina
who
had
risen
from
his
chair
to
receive
her
as
soon
as
he
heard
her
footsteps
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
and
i
must
be
as
brief
as
i
can
for
my
mind
is
in
too
agitated
a
state
to
bear
with
much
temporising
do
me
the
favour
to
take
a
chair
and
listen
while
i
make
you
acquainted
with
what
you
do
not
know
susan
trembled
and
the
colour
flew
from
her
cheeks
as
she
sat
down
on
the
chair
which
mcelvina
handed
to
her
your
father
susan
took
me
by
the
hand
at
the
time
that
i
was
in
great
distress
in
consequence
of
my
having
pleased
him
by
an
act
of
common
honesty
you
know
how
kind
and
considerate
a
patron
he
has
been
to
me
since
and
i
have
now
been
in
his
employ
some
years
this
evening
he
has
overpowered
me
with
a
weight
of
gratitude
by
allowing
me
to
aspire
to
that
which
i
most
covet
on
earth
and
has
consented
to
my
robbing
him
if
i
can
of
his
greatest
treasure
you
can
not
mistake
what
i
mean
but
previous
to
my
requesting
an
answer
on
a
point
in
which
my
future
happiness
is
involved
i
have
an
act
of
justice
to
perform
towards
you
and
of
conscience
towards
myself
which
must
be
fulfilled
it
is
to
be
candid
and
not
allow
you
to
be
entrapped
into
an
alliance
with
a
person
of
whose
life
you
at
present
know
but
the
fair
side
first
let
me
state
to
you
susan
that
my
parentage
is
as
obscure
as
it
well
can
be
and
secondly
that
the
early
part
of
my
life
was
as
vicious
i
may
indeed
extenuate
it
when
i
enter
into
an
explanation
and
with
great
justice
but
i
have
now
only
stated
the
facts
generally
if
you
wish
me
to
enter
into
particulars
much
as
i
shall
blush
at
the
exposure
and
painful
as
the
task
assigned
will
be
i
shall
not
refuse
even
at
the
risk
of
losing
all
i
covet
by
the
confession
for
much
as
my
happiness
is
at
stake
i
have
too
sincere
a
regard
for
you
to
allow
you
to
contract
any
engagement
with
me
without
making
this
candid
avowal
now
susan
answer
me
frankly
whether
in
the
first
place
you
wish
me
to
discover
the
particulars
of
my
early
life
in
the
next
place
if
you
decline
hearing
them
whether
after
this
general
avowal
you
will
listen
to
any
solicitations
on
my
part
to
induce
you
to
unite
your
future
destiny
with
mine
captain
mcelvina
i
thank
you
for
your
candour
replied
susan
and
will
imitate
you
in
my
answer
your
obscure
parentage
can
not
be
a
matter
of
consideration
to
one
who
has
no
descent
to
boast
of
that
you
have
not
always
been
leading
a
creditable
life
i
am
sorry
for
more
sorry
because
i
am
sure
it
must
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
mortification
to
you
but
i
have
not
an
idle
curiosity
to
wish
you
to
impart
that
which
would
not
tend
to
my
happiness
to
divulge
i
did
once
hear
an
old
gentlewoman
who
had
been
conversant
with
the
world
declare
that
if
every
man
was
obliged
to
confess
the
secrets
of
his
life
before
marriage
few
young
women
would
be
persuaded
to
go
up
to
the
altar
i
hope
it
is
not
true
but
whether
it
is
or
not
it
does
not
exactly
bear
upon
the
subject
in
agitation
i
again
thank
you
for
your
candour
and
disclaim
all
wish
to
know
any
further
i
believe
i
have
now
answered
your
question
not
yet
susan
you
have
not
yet
answered
the
latter
part
of
it
what
was
it
i
do
recollect
it
was
said
mcelvina
picking
up
the
piece
of
twisted
paper
which
susan
had
thrown
under
the
grate
whether
you
would
listen
to
my
entreaties
to
sign
your
name
in
future
as
on
this
paper
oh
mcelvina
cried
susan
how
unfair
how
ungenerous
now
i
detest
you
i
not
believe
that
i
have
your
own
handwriting
to
the
contrary
and
i
appeal
to
your
father
nay
rather
than
that
you
have
set
me
an
example
of
candour
and
shall
profit
by
it
promise
me
mcelvina
always
to
treat
me
as
you
have
this
day
and
here
is
my
hand
who
would
not
be
to
be
so
rewarded
replied
mcelvina
as
he
embraced
the
blushing
girl
ah
all
right
i
perceive
cried
old
hornblow
who
had
opened
the
door
unperceived
come
my
children
take
my
blessing
long
may
you
live
happy

chapter
twenty

he
was
a
shrewd
philosopher
and
had
read
every
text
and
gloss
over
whatever
sceptic
could
inquire
for
for
every
he
had
a
he
could
reduce
all
things
to
acts
and
knew
their
nature
by
abstracts
hudibras
captain
m
was
not
unmindful
of
the
promise
which
he
had
made
to
mcelvina
relative
to
our
hero
and
when
he
returned
to
the
ship
he
sent
for
macallan
the
surgeon
and
requested
as
a
personal
favour
that
he
would
superintend
willy
education
and
direct
his
studies
macallan
was
too
partial
to
captain
m
to
refuse
and
fortunately
had
imbibed
a
strong
regard
for
willy
whose
romantic
history
early
courage
and
amiability
of
disposition
had
made
him
a
general
favourite
macallan
therefore
willingly
undertook
the
tuition
of
a
boy
who
combined
energy
or
mind
with
docility
of
disposition
and
sweetness
of
temper
there
could
not
have
been
selected
a
person
better
qualified
than
the
surgeon
for
imparting
that
general
knowledge
so
valuable
in
and
under
his
guidance
willy
soon
proved
that
strong
intellectual
powers
were
among
the
other
advantages
which
he
had
received
from
nature
the
flew
before
the
trade
winds
and
in
a
few
weeks
arrived
at
barbadoes
where
captain
m
found
orders
left
by
the
admiral
of
the
station
directing
him
to
survey
a
dangerous
reef
of
rocks
to
the
northward
of
porto
rico
and
to
continue
to
cruise
for
some
weeks
in
that
quarter
after
the
service
had
been
performed
in
three
days
the
frigate
was
revictualled
and
watered
and
the
officers
had
barely
time
to
have
their
sea
arrangements
completed
before
the
frigate
again
expanded
her
canvas
to
a
favourable
breeze
in
a
few
hours
the
island
was
left
so
far
astern
as
to
appear
like
the
blue
mist
which
so
often
deceives
the
expectant
scanner
of
the
horizon

from

upon
my
soul
its
excessively
annoying
one
bell
mr
courtenay
cried
jerry
at
the
door
mr
price
will
thank
you
to
relieve
him
i
say
mr
prose
continued
jerry
as
he
passed
through
the
steerage
to
return
on
deck
i
just
trouble
you
to
hand
your
carcase
up
as
soon
as
convenient
directly
jerry
i
will
but
my
tea
is
so
hot
well
then
leave
it
and
i
drink
it
for
you
replied
jerry
ascending
the
ladder
well
mr
g
did
you
tell
mr
courtenay
inquired
price
yes
sir
replied
jerry
what
did
he
say
he
said
the
bottle
sir
replied
jerry
touching
his
hat
and
not
changing
a
muscle
of
his
countenance
although
delighted
with
the
vexation
that
appeared
in
that
of
the
tired
lieutenant
as
he
walked
away
forward
for
two
or
three
days
the
frigate
sailed
between
the
islands
which
reared
their
lofty
crests
abruptly
from
the
ocean
like
the
embattlements
of
some
vast
castle
which
had
been
submerged
to
the
water
edge
her
progress
was
slow
as
she
was
only
indebted
to
the
land
or
sea
breezes
as
they
alternately
blew
and
was
becalmed
at
the
close
of
the
day
during
the
pause
between
their
relieving
each
other
from
their
duty
such
was
the
situation
of
the
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
the
scene
was
one
of
those
splendid
panoramas
which
are
only
to
be
gazed
upon
in
tropical
climes
the
sun
was
near
setting
and
as
he
passed
through
the
horizontal
streaks
of
vapour
fringed
their
narrow
edges
with
a
blaze
of
glory
strongly
in
contrast
with
the
deep
blue
of
the
zenith
reflected
by
the
still
wave
in
every
quarter
except
where
the
descending
orb
poured
down
his
volume
of
rays
which
changed
the
sea
into
an
element
of
molten
gold
the
frigate
was
lying
motionless
in
the
narrow
channel
between
two
of
the
islands
the
high
mountains
of
which
in
deep
and
solemn
shade
were
reflected
in
lengthened
shadows
extending
to
the
vessel
sides
and
looking
downwards
you
beheld
the
mountains
bowed
many
of
the
officers
were
standing
abaft
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
scene
but
not
giving
vent
to
their
feelings
from
an
inward
consciousness
of
inability
to
do
justice
to
it
in
their
expressions
macallan
first
broke
the
silence
who
would
imagine
courtenay
that
ere
yonder
sun
shall
rise
again
a
hurricane
may
exhaust
its
rage
upon
a
spot
so
calm
so
beautiful
as
this
where
all
now
seems
to
whisper
peace
the
remark
was
followed
by
a
noise
like
that
proceeding
from
a
distant
gun
is
it
pace
you
mane
doctor
said
one
of
the
midshipmen
from
the
sister
kingdom
by
the
powers
there
to
the
knife
already
look
continued
he
pointing
with
his
finger
in
a
direction
under
the
land
there
a
battle
between
the
whale
and
the
thrasher
the
remark
of
the
midshipman
was
correct
and
the
whole
party
congregated
on
the
taffrail
to
witness
the
struggle
which
had
already
commenced
the
blows
of
the
thrasher
a
large
fish
of
the
same
species
as
the
whale
given
with
incredible
force
and
noise
on
the
back
of
the
whale
were
now
answered
by
his
more
unwieldy
antagonist
who
lashed
the
sea
with
fury
in
his
attempts
to
retaliate
upon
his
more
active
assailant
and
while
the
contention
lasted
the
water
was
in
a
foam
in
a
few
minutes
the
whale
plunged
and
disappeared
he
has
had
enough
of
it
observed
the
master
but
the
thrasher
will
not
let
him
off
so
easily
he
must
come
up
to
breathe
directly
and
you
find
the
thrasher
and
with
him
again
as
the
master
observed
the
whale
soon
reappeared
and
the
thrasher
who
had
closely
pursued
him
as
if
determined
to
make
up
for
lost
time
threw
himself
out
of
the
water
and
came
down
upon
the
whale
striking
him
with
tremendous
force
upon
the
shoulder
the
whale
plunged
so
perpendicularly
that
his
broad
tail
was
many
feet
upraised
in
the
air
and
the
persecuted
animal
was
seen
no
more
that
last
broadside
settled
him
said
courtenay
him
too
i
think
cried
jerry
strange
observed
courtenay
addressing
macallan
that
there
should
be
such
an
antipathy
between
the
animals
the
west
indians
assert
that
at
the
same
time
the
thrasher
attacks
him
above
the
pierces
him
underneath
if
so
it
must
be
very
annoying
i
have
heard
the
same
story
but
have
never
myself
seen
the
replied
macallan
it
is
however
very
possible
as
there
is
no
animal
in
the
creation
that
has
so
many
enemies
as
the
whale
a
tax
on
greatness
observed
jerry
i
glad
it
goes
by
mr
macallan
continued
he
you
a
philosopher
and
i
have
heard
you
argue
that
whatever
is
is
right
will
you
explain
to
my
consummate
ignorance
upon
what
just
grounds
the
thrasher
attacks
that
unoffending
mass
of
blubber
i
explain
it
to
you
said
courtenay
laughing
the
whale
who
has
just
come
from
the
northward
finds
himself
in
very
comfortable
quarters
here
and
has
no
wish
to
heave
up
his
anchor
and
proceed
on
his
voyage
round
cape
horn
the
thrasher
is
the
of
the
station
and
his
blows
are
so
many
guns
to
enforce
his
orders
to
sail
forthwith
thank
you
sir
answered
jerry
sarcastically
for
your
very
ingenious
explanation
but
i
do
not
see
why
his
guns
should
be
shotted
perhaps
mr
macallan
will
now
oblige
me
by
his
ideas
on
the
subject
how
far
these
islands
may
be
the
capua
to
the
whale
which
mr
courtenay
presumes
i
can
not
say
answered
the
surgeon
pompously
but
i
have
observed
that
all
the
cetaceous
tribe
are
very
much
annoyed
by
vermin
which
adhere
to
their
skins
you
often
see
the
porpoises
and
smaller
fish
of
this
class
throw
themselves
into
the
air
and
fall
flat
on
the
water
to
detach
the
barnacles
and
other
parasitical
insects
which
distress
them
may
it
not
be
that
the
whale
being
so
enormous
an
animal
and
not
able
to
employ
the
same
means
of
relief
receives
it
from
the
blows
of
the
thrasher
bravo
doctor
why
then
the
thrasher
may
be
considered
as
a
medical
attendant
to
the
whale
and
from
the
specimen
we
have
witnessed
of
his
humanity
a
naval
practitioner
i
have
no
doubt
added
jerry
very
well
mr
jerry
if
ever
you
come
under
my
hands
you
shall
smart
for
that
very
little
chance
doctor
i
such
a
miserable
object
that
even
disease
passes
by
me
with
contempt
if
i
ever
am
in
your
list
i
presume
it
will
be
for
a
case
of
plethora
replied
jerry
spanning
his
thin
waist
young
gentlemen
get
down
directly
what
are
you
all
doing
there
on
the
taffrail
bawled
out
the
who
had
just
come
up
the
ladder
we
been
looking
at
a
said
jerry
in
a
tone
of
voice
sufficiently
loud
to
excite
the
merriment
of
those
about
him
without
being
heard
by
the
what
the
joke
observed
mr
bully
coming
aft
as
the
midshipmen
were
dispersing
some
of
mr
j
nonsense
replied
the
surgeon
this
answer
not
being
satisfactory
the
took
it
for
granted
as
people
usually
do
that
the
laugh
was
against
himself
and
his
choler
was
raised
against
the
offending
party
mr
j
ay
that
young
man
thinks
of
anything
but
his
duty
there
he
is
playing
with
the
captain
dog
and
his
watch
i
answer
for
it
or
he
would
not
be
on
deck
mr
j
continued
the
to
jerry
who
was
walking
up
and
down
to
leeward
followed
by
a
large
newfoundland
dog
is
it
your
watch
yes
sir
replied
jerry
touching
his
hat
then
why
are
you
skylarking
with
that
dog
i
am
not
skylarking
with
the
dog
sir
he
follows
me
up
and
down
i
believe
he
takes
me
for
a
i
am
not
surprised
at
it
replied
the
laughing
the
surgeon
who
remained
abaft
was
now
accosted
by
willy
who
had
been
amusing
himself
leaning
over
the
side
of
a
boat
which
had
been
lowered
down
by
the
to
examine
the
staying
of
the
masts
and
catching
in
a
tin
pot
the
various
minute
objects
of
natural
history
which
passed
by
as
the
frigate
glided
slowly
along
what
shell
is
this
mr
macallan
which
i
have
picked
up
it
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
by
means
of
these
which
are
attached
to
it
that
shell
willy
replied
macallan
who
mounting
his
favourite
hobby
immediately
spouted
his
pompous
truths
is
called
by
naturalists
the
ianthina
fragilis
perhaps
the
weakest
and
most
delicate
in
its
texture
which
exists
and
yet
the
see
note
which
ventures
to
contend
with
the
stormy
ocean
the
varieties
of
the
nautili
have
the
same
property
of
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
water
but
they
seldom
are
found
many
miles
from
land
they
are
only
coasters
in
comparison
with
this
adventurous
little
navigator
which
alone
braves
the
atlantic
and
floats
about
in
the
same
fathomless
deep
which
is
ranged
by
the
devouring
shark
and
lashed
by
the
stupendous
whale
i
have
picked
up
these
little
sailors
nearly
one
thousand
miles
from
the
land
yet
observe
it
is
his
security
his
tenement
of
such
thin
texture
to
enable
him
to
float
with
greater
ease
would
not
be
able
to
encounter
the
rippling
of
the
wave
upon
the
smoothest
beach
what
use
are
they
of
of
no
direct
use
that
i
know
of
william
but
if
it
has
no
other
use
than
to
induce
you
to
reflect
a
little
it
has
not
been
made
in
vain
all
created
things
are
not
applicable
to
the
wants
or
the
enjoyment
of
man
but
their
examination
will
always
tend
to
his
improvement
when
you
analyse
this
little
creature
in
its
domicile
and
see
how
wonderfully
it
is
provided
with
all
means
necessary
for
its
existence
when
you
compare
it
with
the
thousand
varieties
upon
the
beach
in
all
of
which
you
will
perceive
the
same
visible
the
same
attention
in
providing
for
their
wants
the
same
minute
and
endless
beauty
of
colour
and
of
form
you
can
not
but
acknowledge
the
vastness
and
the
magnificence
of
the
maker
in
the
same
manner
the
flowers
and
shrubs
which
embellish
as
they
cover
the
earth
are
not
all
so
much
for
use
as
they
are
for
ornament
what
human
ingenuity
can
approach
to
the
perfection
of
the
meanest
effort
of
the
almighty
hand
has
it
not
been
pointed
out
in
the
scriptures
the
lilies
of
the
field
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
and
yet
i
say
unto
you
that
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
never
debate
in
your
mind
willy
of
what
use
are
these
things
which
god
has
made
for
of
what
then
is
man
the
most
endowed
and
the
most
perverse
of
all
creation
except
to
show
the
goodness
and
the
forbearance
of
the
almighty
you
may
hereafter
be
inclined
to
debate
why
noxious
reptiles
and
ferocious
beasts
that
not
only
are
useless
to
man
but
a
source
of
dread
and
of
danger
have
been
created
they
have
their
inheritance
upon
earth
as
well
as
man
and
combine
with
the
rest
of
animated
nature
to
show
the
power
and
the
wisdom
and
the
endless
variety
of
the
creator
it
is
true
that
all
animals
were
made
for
our
use
but
recollect
that
when
man
fell
from
his
perfect
state
it
was
declared
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
thou
shalt
eat
bread
are
trackless
forests
and
yet
unexplored
regions
to
remain
without
living
creatures
to
enjoy
them
until
they
shall
be
required
by
man
and
is
man
in
his
fallen
state
to
possess
all
the
earth
and
its
advantages
without
labour
without
fulfilling
his
destiny
no
ferocious
and
noxious
animals
disappear
only
before
cultivation
it
is
part
of
the
labour
to
which
he
has
been
sentenced
that
he
should
rend
them
out
as
the
and
the
thorn
or
drive
them
to
those
regions
which
are
not
yet
required
by
him
and
of
which
they
may
continue
to
have
possession
undisturbed
such
was
the
language
of
macallan
to
our
hero
whose
thirst
for
knowledge
constantly
made
fresh
demands
upon
the
surgeon
fund
of
information
and
pedantic
as
his
language
may
appear
it
contained
important
truths
which
were
treasured
up
by
the
retentive
memory
of
his
pupil
note
i
am
aware
that
there
are
two
or
three
other
pelagic
shells
but
at
the
time
of
this
narrative
they
were
not
known
chapter
twenty
five
how
frail
how
cowardly
is
woman
mind
yet
when
strong
jealousy
inflames
the
soul
the
weak
will
roar
and
calms
to
tempests
roll
lee
rival
queens
but
we
must
now
follow
up
the
motions
of
mr
rainscourt
who
quitted
the
castle
and
travelling
with
great
diligence
once
more
trod
the
pavement
of
the
metropolis
which
he
had
quitted
in
equal
haste
but
under
very
different
circumstances
the
news
of
his
good
fortune
had
preceded
him
and
he
received
all
that
homage
which
is
invariably
shown
to
a
man
who
has
many
creditors
and
the
means
of
satisfying
all
their
demands
as
he
had
prophesied
the
little
gentleman
in
black
was
as
obsequious
as
could
be
desired
and
threw
out
many
indirect
hints
of
the
pleasure
he
should
have
in
superintending
mr
rainscourt
future
arrangements
and
by
way
of
reinstating
himself
in
his
good
graces
acquainted
him
with
a
plan
for
reducing
the
amount
of
the
demands
that
were
made
upon
him
rainscourt
who
never
forgave
so
far
acceded
to
the
lawyer
wishes
as
to
permit
him
to
take
that
part
of
the
arrangements
into
his
hands
and
after
mr
j
had
succeeded
in
bringing
the
usurers
to
reasonable
terms
when
all
had
been
duly
signed
and
sealed
not
only
were
his
services
declined
for
the
future
but
the
servants
were
desired
to
show
him
the
as
his
wife
had
remarked
rainscourt
found
no
difficulty
in
making
friends
of
all
sorts
and
of
both
sexes
and
he
had
launched
into
a
routine
of
gaiety
and
dissipation
in
which
he
continued
for
several
months
without
allowing
his
wife
and
daughter
to
interrupt
his
amusements
or
to
enter
his
thoughts
he
had
enclosed
an
order
upon
the
banker
at
soon
after
his
arrival
in
london
and
he
considered
that
he
had
done
all
that
was
requisite
such
was
not
however
the
opinion
of
his
wife
to
be
immured
in
a
lonely
castle
in
ireland
was
neither
her
intention
nor
her
taste
finding
that
repeated
letters
were
unanswered
in
which
she
requested
permission
to
join
him
and
pointed
out
the
necessity
that
emily
who
was
now
nearly
twelve
years
old
should
have
the
advantages
of
tuition
which
his
fortune
could
command
she
packed
up
a
slender
wardrobe
and
in
a
week
arrived
in
london
with
emily
and
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
to
which
rainscourt
had
directed
that
his
letters
should
be
addressed
rainscourt
was
not
at
home
when
she
arrived
announcing
herself
as
his
wife
she
was
shown
upstairs
into
his
apartments
a
minute
survey
of
which
with
their
contents
was
immediately
made
and
the
notes
and
letters
which
were
carelessly
strewed
upon
the
tables
and
all
of
which
she
took
the
liberty
to
peruse
had
the
effect
of
throwing
mrs
rainscourt
into
a
transport
of
jealousy
and
indignation
the
minutes
appeared
hours
and
the
hours
months
until
he
made
his
appearance
which
he
at
last
did
accompanied
by
two
fashionable
with
whom
he
associated
the
waiters
who
happened
not
to
be
in
the
way
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
had
not
announced
to
him
the
arrival
of
his
wife
who
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
one
hand
full
of
notes
and
letters
the
superscriptions
of
which
were
evidently
in
a
female
hand
and
the
other
holding
her
handkerchief
as
if
prepared
for
a
scene
one
leg
was
crossed
over
the
other
and
the
foot
of
the
one
that
was
above
worked
in
the
air
up
and
down
with
the
force
of
a
piston
of
a
indicative
of
the
propelling
power
within
when
rainscourt
whose
voice
was
heard
all
the
way
upstairs
arrived
at
the
and
in
answer
to
a
question
of
one
of
his
companions
replied
go
and
see
her
not
i
i
quite
tired
of
her
by
jove
i
as
soon
see
my
wife
and
as
he
finished
the
sentence
entered
the
apartment
where
the
unexpected
appearance
of
mrs
rainscourt
made
him
involuntarily
exclaim
talk
of
the
devil
and
she
appears
sir
replied
the
lady
rising
and
making
a
profound
courtesy
pooh
my
dear
replied
rainscourt
embarrassed
and
unwilling
that
a
scene
should
take
place
before
his
companions
i
was
only
joking
good
morning
rainscourt
said
one
of
his
friends
i
afraid
that
i
shall
be
and
i
off
too
my
dear
fellow
for
there
no
saying
how
the
joke
may
be
taken
added
the
other
following
his
companion
out
of
the
room
emily
ran
up
to
her
father
and
took
his
hand
and
rainscourt
who
was
as
much
attached
to
his
daughter
as
his
selfish
character
would
permit
kissed
her
forehead
both
parties
were
for
a
short
time
silent
both
preferred
to
await
the
attack
rather
than
commence
it
but
in
a
trial
of
forbearance
of
this
description
it
may
easily
be
supposed
that
the
gentleman
gained
the
victory
mrs
rainscourt
waited
until
she
found
that
she
must
either
give
vent
to
her
feelings
by
words
or
that
her
whole
frame
would
explode
and
the
action
commenced
on
her
side
with
a
shower
of
tears
which
ended
in
violent
hysterics
the
first
were
unheeded
by
her
husband
who
always
considered
them
as
a
kind
of
scaling
her
guns
previous
to
an
engagement
but
the
hysterics
rather
baffled
him
in
his
own
house
he
would
have
rung
for
the
servants
and
left
them
to
repair
damages
but
at
an
hotel
an
eclat
was
to
be
avoided
if
possible
emily
my
dear
go
to
your
mother
you
know
how
to
help
her
no
i
do
not
papa
said
the
child
crying
but
norah
used
to
open
her
hands
rainscourt
eyes
were
naturally
directed
to
the
fingers
of
his
wife
in
which
he
perceived
a
collection
of
notes
and
letters
he
thought
it
might
be
advisable
to
open
her
hand
if
it
were
only
to
recover
these
out
of
her
possession
what
affection
would
not
have
induced
him
to
do
interest
accomplished
he
advanced
to
the
sofa
and
attempted
to
open
her
clenched
hands
but
whether
mrs
rainscourt
hysterics
were
only
feigned
or
of
such
violence
as
to
defy
the
strength
of
her
husband
all
his
efforts
to
extract
the
letters
proved
ineffectual
and
after
several
unavailing
attempts
he
desisted
from
his
exertions
what
else
is
good
for
her
emily
water
papa
thrown
in
her
face
shall
i
ring
for
some
no
my
dear
is
there
nothing
else
we
can
do
oh
yes
papa
unlace
her
stays
rainscourt
who
was
not
very
expert
as
a
lady
maid
had
some
difficulty
in
arriving
at
the
stays
through
the
folds
of
the
gown
the
more
so
as
mrs
rainscourt
was
very
violent
in
her
movements
and
he
was
not
a
little
irritated
by
sundry
pricks
which
he
received
from
those
indispensable
articles
of
dress
which
the
fair
sex
are
necessitated
to
use
pointing
out
to
us
that
there
are
no
roses
without
thorns
when
he
did
arrive
at
the
desired
encasement
he
was
just
as
much
puzzled
to
find
an
end
to
what
appeared
like
the
gordian
knot
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
giving
way
to
the
natural
impatience
of
his
temper
he
seized
a
penknife
from
the
table
to
divide
it
unfortunately
in
his
hurry
instead
of
inserting
the
knife
on
the
inside
of
the
lace
so
as
to
cut
him
he
cut
down
upon
it
and
not
meeting
with
the
resistance
which
he
expected
the
point
of
the
knife
entered
with
no
trifling
force
into
the
back
of
mrs
rainscourt
who
to
his
astonishment
immediately
started
on
her
legs
crying
would
you
murder
me
mr
rainscourt
help
help
it
was
quite
accidental
my
dear
said
rainscourt
in
a
soothing
tone
for
he
was
afraid
of
her
bringing
the
whole
house
about
her
ears
i
really
am
quite
shocked
at
my
own
awkwardness
it
quite
recovered
you
though
mamma
observed
emily
with
great
simplicity
and
for
which
remark
to
her
astonishment
she
was
saluted
with
a
smart
box
on
the
ear
why
should
you
be
shocked
mr
rainscourt
said
the
lady
who
as
her
daughter
had
remarked
seemed
wonderfully
recovered
from
the
which
had
been
administered
why
should
you
be
shocked
at
stabbing
me
in
the
back
have
i
not
wherewithal
in
my
hand
to
stab
me
a
thousand
times
in
the
heart
look
at
these
letters
all
of
which
i
have
read
you
had
indeed
reason
to
leave
me
in
galway
but
i
will
submit
to
it
no
longer
mr
rainscourt
i
insist
upon
an
immediate
separation
why
should
we
quarrel
then
my
dear
when
we
are
both
of
one
mind
now
do
me
the
favour
to
sit
down
and
talk
the
matter
over
quietly
what
is
it
that
you
require
first
then
mr
rainscourt
an
acknowledgment
on
your
part
that
i
am
a
most
injured
and
most
woman
granted
my
dear
if
that
will
add
to
your
happiness
i
certainly
have
never
known
your
value
do
sneer
sir
if
you
please
secondly
a
handsome
allowance
commensurate
with
your
fortune
granted
with
pleasure
mrs
rainscourt
thirdly
mr
rainscourt
an
extra
allowance
for
the
education
and
expenses
of
my
daughter
who
will
remain
under
my
care
granted
also
further
mr
rainscourt
to
keep
up
appearances
i
wish
one
of
the
mansions
on
your
different
estates
in
england
to
be
appropriated
for
our
use
your
daughter
ought
to
be
known
and
reside
on
the
property
of
which
she
is
the
future
heiress
a
reasonable
demand
which
i
accede
to
is
there
anything
further
nothing
of
moment
but
for
emily
sake
i
should
wish
that
you
should
pay
us
an
occasional
visit
and
generally
speaking
keep
up
appearances
before
the
world
that
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
do
my
dear
and
shall
always
speak
of
you
as
i
feel
with
respect
and
esteem
is
there
anything
more
mrs
rainscourt
there
is
not
but
i
believe
that
if
i
had
been
ten
times
more
exorbitant
in
my
demands
replied
the
lady
with
pique
that
you
would
have
granted
them
for
the
pleasure
of
getting
rid
of
me
i
would
indeed
my
dear
replied
rainscourt
you
may
command
me
in
anything
except
my
own
person
i
require
no
partition
sir
than
that
of
your
fortune
and
of
that
my
dear
you
shall
as
i
have
declared
have
a
liberal
share
so
now
mrs
rainscourt
i
think
we
can
have
no
further
occasion
for
disagreement
the
property
in
norfolk
where
admiral
de
courcy
resided
is
a
beautiful
spot
and
i
request
you
will
consider
it
as
your
of
course
you
will
be
your
own
mistress
when
you
feel
inclined
to
change
the
scene
and
now
as
all
may
be
considered
as
settled
let
us
shake
hands
and
henceforward
be
good
friends
mrs
rainscourt
gave
her
hand
and
sealed
the
new
contract
but
as
she
had
been
at
variance
with
her
husband
for
years
and
now
convinced
that
she
had
been
outraged
in
the
tenderest
point
still
her
heart
leaned
towards
the
father
of
her
child
the
hand
that
now
was
extended
in
earnest
of
future
separation
reminded
her
of
the
day
when
she
had
offered
it
in
pledge
of
future
fidelity
and
love
and
had
listened
with
rapture
to
his
reciprocal
obligation
she
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
which
was
soon
moistened
with
her
tears
such
is
woman
to
the
last
moment
she
cherishes
her
love
pure
as
an
emanation
from
the
deity
in
the
happy
days
of
confidence
and
truth
it
sheds
a
halo
round
her
existence
in
those
of
sorrow
and
desertion
memory
guided
by
its
resistless
power

those
hours
which
were
sunny
and
serene
however
mrs
rainscourt
soon
found
out
that
an
unlimited
credit
upon
the
banker
was
no
bad
substitute
for
a
worthless
husband
and
assisted
by
her
pride
she
enjoyed
more

she
had
done
for
many
years
during
her
stay

london
rainscourt
occasionally
paid
his
respects
behaved
with
great
kindness
and
propriety
and
appeared
not
a
little
proud
of
the
expanding
beauty
of
his
daughter
mrs
rainscourt
not
only
recovered
her
spirits
but
her
personal
attractions
and
their
numerous
acquaintance

what
could
possess
mr

to
be
indifferent

so
lively
and
so
charming

woman
in
a
few
weeks
the

was
ready
to

the
weather
was
fine
and
the
water
smooth
on
the
morning
when
the
arrived
at
the
reef
which
although
well
known
to
exist
had
been
very
incorrectly
laid
down
and
captain
m
thought
it
advisable
to
drop
his
anchor
in
preference
to
lying
off
and
on
so
near
to
dangers
which
might
extend
much
farther
than
he
was
aware
the
frigate
was
therefore
brought
up
in
eighteen
fathoms
about
two
miles
from
that
part
of
the
reef
which
discovered
itself
above
water
the
captain
and
master
undertook
the
survey
but
any
officers
who
volunteered
their
assistance
or
midshipmen
who
wished
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
of
gaining
a
practical
knowledge
of
maritime
surveying
were
permitted
to
join
the
party
another
boat
having
been
lowered
down
for
their
accommodation
hector
the
captain
newfoundland
dog
was
flying
about
the
decks
mad
with
delight
as
he
always
was
when
a
boat
was
lowered
down
as
he
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
a
swim
captain
m
who
had
breakfasted
and
whose
boat
was
manned
alongside
came
on
deck
when
the
dog
fawning
on
him
he
desired
that
his
broad
leather
collar
with
the
ship
name
in
large
brass
letters
riveted
round
it
should
be
taken
off
that
it
might
not
be
injured
by
the
salt
water
jerry
who
was
on
deck
and
received
the
order
asked
the
captain
for
the
key
of
the
padlock
which
secured
it
and
captain
m
handed
him
his
bunch
of
keys
to
which
it
had
been
affixed
and
desiring
him
to
take
the
collar
off
and
return
the
keys
to
him
descended
again
to
his
cabin
jerry
soon
dispossessed
the
dog
of
his
collar
and
ripe
for
mischief
went
down
to
the
midshipmen
berth
where
he
found
prose
alone
the
rest
being
all
on
deck
or
scattered
about
the
ship
prose
was
the
person
that
he
wanted
being
the
only
one
upon
whom
he
could
venture
a
practical
joke
without
incurring
more
risk
than
was
agreeable
jerry
commenced
by
fixing
the
collar
round
his
own
neck
and
said
i
wish
i
could
get
now
if
the
situation
of
was
only
vacant
i
should
like
the
rating
amazingly
i
should
soon
get
fat
then
and
i
think
i
should
look
well
up
in
this
collar
why
jerry
that
collar
certainly
does
look
as
if
it
was
made
for
you
it
rather
ornamental
i
do
declare
i
wish
i
had
a
glass
to
see
how
it
looks
i
would
try
it
on
you
prose
but
you
such
a
bull
neck
that
it
would
go
half
round
it
bull
neck
jerry
why
i
lay
you
sixpence
that
my
neck
almost
as
small
as
yours
and
i
lay
you
a
shilling
that
the
collar
will
go
round
my
neck
done
now
let
see
recollect
the
staple
must
go
into
the
hole
or
you
lose
said
jerry
fixing
the
collar
round
prose
neck
and
pretending
that
the
staple
was
not
into
the
hole
of
the
collar
until
he
had
inserted
the
padlock
turned
and
taken
out
the
key
well
i
do
declare
i
lost
prose
i
must
go
and
get
you
the
shilling
continued
jerry
making
his
escape
out
of
the
berth
and
leaving
prose
with
the
collar
so
tight
under
his
chin
that
he
could
scarcely
open
his
mouth
jerry
arrived
on
the
just
as
the
captain
was
stepping
into
the
boat
and
he
went
up
to
him
and
touching
his
hat
presented
him
with
the
bunch
of
keys
oh
thank
you
mr
jerry
i
had
forgotten
them
said
captain
m
descending
the
side
and
shoving
off
whose
clothes
are
these
hanging
on
the
said
mr
bully
who
had
given
order
that
no
clothes
were
to
be
drying
after
eight
in
the
morning
i
believe
that
they
are
mr
prose
sir
though
i
am
not
sure
answered
jerry
who
knew
very
well
that
they
were
not
but
wished
that
prose
should
be
sent
for
tell
mr
prose
to
come
up
to
me
directly
jerry
immediately
ran
down
to
the
berth
well
now
jerry
this
is
too
bad
i
do
declare
come
take
it
off
again
that
a
good
fellow
mr
prose
said
the
the
wants
you
on
deck
directly
there
now
jerry
what
a
mess
i
might
have
been
in
where
the
key
i
have
not
got
it
replied
jerry
the
captain
saw
me
on
the
and
took
the
bunch
of
keys
away
with
him
what
is
the
captain
gone
away
i
do
declare
now
this
is
too
bad
cried
prose
in
a
rage
too
bad
why
man
do
be
angry
it
a
distinction
between
me
and
the
you
are
created
a
knight
of
the
i
gave
you
the
and
he
has
given
you
the
which
i
recommend
you
to
comply
with
without
you
wish
further
elevation
to
the
mr
prose
the
wants
you
immediately
said
the
who
had
been
despatched
to
him
again
why
how
can
i
go
up
with
a
dog
collar
round
my
neck
i
sorry
very
sorry
indeed
prose

jerry
went
up
accordingly
mr
prose
is
not
well
sir
he
has
a
sort
of
i
wish
to
god
you
had
the
same
complaint
sir
replied
the
who
owed
him
one
macallan
is
mr
prose
ill
not
that
i
know
of
he
has
not
applied
to
me
i
go
down
and
see
him
before
i
go
on
shore
macallan
came
up
laughing
but
he
recovered
his
seriousness
before
bully
perceived
it
well
doctor
mr
prose
is
certainly
not
very
fit
to
come
on
deck
in
his
present
state
said
macallan
who
then
descended
the
side
and
the
boat
which
had
been
waiting
for
him
shoved
off
but
this
time
jerry
was
caught
in
his
own
trap
mr
j
where
is
the
dog
collar
it
must
be
oiled
and
cleaned
said
the
shall
i
give
it
to
the
armourer
sir
replied
jerry
no
bring
it
up
to
me
jerry
went
down
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
i
can
not
find
it
sir
i
left
it
in
the
berth
when
i
came
on
deck
that
just
like
your
usual
carelessness
mr
j
now
go
up
to
the
and
stay
there
till
i
call
you
down
jerry
who
did
not
like
the
turn
which
the
joke
had
taken
moved
up
with
a
very
reluctant
step
at
the
rate
of
about
one
ratline
in
ten
seconds
come
sir
what
are
you
about
i
no
sir
replied
jerry
to
the
a
sarcasm
which
hit
so
hard
that
jerry
was
not
called
down
till
dark
and
long
after
prose
had
by
making
interest
with
the
captain
steward
obtained
the
keys
and
released
his
neck
from
its
enthralment
the
party
in
the
second
boat
were
landed
on
the
reef
and
while
the
rest
were
attending
to
the
survey
macallan
was
employed
in
examining
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
and
collecting
the
different
objects
of
natural
history
which
presented
themselves
the
boat
was
sent
on
board
as
it
was
not
required
until
the
afternoon
when
the
officers
were
to
return
to
dinner
the
captain
gig
remained
on
shore
and
the
coxswain
was
employed
by
macallan
in
receiving
from
him
the
different
shells
and
varieties
of
coral
with
which
the
rocks
were
covered
take
particular
care
of
this
specimen
said
the
surgeon
as
he
delivered
a
bunch
of
corallines
into
the
hands
of
marshall
the
coxswain
i
ax
your
pardon
mr
macallan
but
what
the
good
of
picking
up
all
this
rubbish
rubbish
replied
the
surgeon
laughing
why
you
do
know
what
it
is
what
do
you
think
those
are
which
i
just
gave
you
why
weeds
are
rubbish
and
these
be
only
pieces
of
seaweed
they
happen
to
be
hanimals
cried
the
coxswain
with
an
incredulous
smile
well
sir
i
always
took
to
be
we
live
and
larn
sure
enough
are
cabbage
and
too
no
replied
the
surgeon
much
amused
they
are
not
marshall
but
these
are
now
take
them
to
the
boat
and
put
them
in
a
safe
place
and
then
come
back
i
say
bill
look
ye
here
said
the
coxswain
to
one
of
the
sailors
who
was
lying
down
on
the
thwarts
of
the
boat
holding
up
the
coral
to
him
in
a
contemptuous
manner
what
the
hell
d
think
this
is
why
it
a
hanimal
a
what
i
be
blow
if
the
doctor
do
say
it
a
hanimal
no
more
a
hanimal
than
i
am
replied
the
sailor
laying
his
head
down
again
on
the
thwarts
and
shutting
his
eyes
in
a
few
minutes
marshall
returned
to
the
surgeon
who
tired
with
clambering
over
the
rocks
was
sitting
down
to
rest
himself
a
little
well
marshall
i
hope
you
have
not
hurt
what
i
gave
into
your
charge
hurt
why
sir
what
you
told
me
i
as
soon
have
hurt
a
cat
what
you
are
superstitious
on
that
point
as
seamen
generally
are
mr
macallan
i
only
knows
that
they
who
a
cat
comes
worst
off
i
proof
positive
of
that
since
i
have
been
in
the
service
i
could
spin
you
a
yarn
well
now
marshall
pray
do
come
sit
down
here
i
am
fond
of
proof
positive
now
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
say
and
i
listen
without
interrupting
you
the
coxswain
took
his
seat
as
macallan
desired
and
taking
the
quid
of
tobacco
out
of
his
cheek
and
laying
it
down
on
the
rock
beside
him
commenced
as
follows
well
now
d
see
mr
macallan
i
just
exactly
tell
you
how
it
was
and
then
i
leaves
you
to
judge
whether
a
cat
to
be
sarved
in
that
way
it
was
when
i
belonged
to
the
frigate
that
we
were
laying
in
cawsand
bay
awaiting
for
sailing
orders
we
had
dropped
the
anchor
more
than
a
week
and
there
was
no
liberty
ashore
well
sir
the
purser
found
out
that
his
steward
was
a
bit
of
a
rascal
and
turns
him
adrift
the
ship
company
knew
that
long
afore
for
it
was
not
a
few
that
he
had
cheated
and
we
were
all
glad
to
see
him
and
his
traps
handed
down
the
side
now
sir
this
here
fellow
had
a
black
cat
but
it
war
at
all
like
other
cats
when
it
was
a
kitten
they
had
cut
off
his
tail
close
to
its
starn
and
his
ears
had
been
shaved
off
just
as
close
to
his
and
the
hanimal
used
to
set
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
fight
like
a
rabbit
it
had
quite
lost
its
natur
as
it
were
and
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
imp
of
darkness
it
always
lived
in
the
purser
steward
room
and
we
never
seed
him
but
when
we
went
down
for
the
biscuit
and
flour
as
was
sarving
out
well
sir
when
this
rascal
of
a
steward
leaves
the
ship
he
had
no
natural
affection
for
his
cat
and
he
leaves
him
on
board
belonging
to
nobody
and
the
steward
as
comes
in
his
place
turns
him
out
of
the
steward
room
so
the
poor
little
devil
had
to
take
care
of
itself
we
all
tried
to
coax
it
into
one
berth
or
the
other
but
the
poor
brute
would
take
to
nobody
you
know
sir
a
cat
does
like
to
change
so
he
wandered
about
the
ship
mewing
all
day
and
thieving
all
night
at
last
he
takes
to
the
master
cabin
and
makes
a
dirt
there
and
the
master
gets
very
savage
and
swears
that
he
kill
him
if
ever
he
comes
athwart
him
now
sir
you
knows
it
the
natur
of
cats
always
to
make
a
dirt
in
the
same
place
reason
why
god
only
knows
and
so
this
poor
black
devil
always
returns
to
the
master
cabin
and
makes
it
as
it
were
his
at
last
the
master
who
was
as
an
officer
as
ever
i
sailed
with
finds
one
day
that
his
sextant
case
is
all
of
a
smudge
so
being
touched
in
a
sore
place
he
gets
into
a
great
rage
and
orders
all
the
boys
of
the
ship
to
catch
the
cat
and
after
much
ado
the
poor
cat
was
catched
and
brought
aft
into
the
then
p
said
the
master
to
the
you
help
kill
the
dirty
beast
and
the
who
cared
more
about
his
lower
deck
being
clean
than
fifty
human
beings
lives
said
he
would
so
they
called
the
sargant
o
marines
and
orders
him
to
bring
up
two
ship
muskets
and
some
ball
cartridge
and
they
goes
on
deck
with
the
cat
in
their
arms
well
sir
when
the
men
saw
the
cat
brought
up
on
deck
and
hears
that
he
was
to
be
hove
overboard
they
all
congregates
together
upon
the
lee
gangway
and
gives
their
opinions
on
the
subject
and
one
says
go
and
speak
to
the
and
another
says
put
you
on
the
black
list
and
so
they
do
do
nothing
all
except
jenkins
the
boatswain
mate
who
calls
to
a
waterman
out
of
the
port
and
says
says
he
they
heaves
that
cat
overboard
do
you
pick
him
up
and
i
give
you
a
shilling
and
the
waterman
says
as
how
he
would
for
you
see
sir
the
men
did
know
that
the
muskets
had
been
ordered
up
to
shoot
the
poor
beast
well
sir
the
waterman
laid
off
on
his
oars
and
the
men
knowing
what
jenkins
had
done
were
content
but
when
the
sargant
o
marines
comes
up
and
loads
the
muskets
with
ball
cartridges
then
the
men
begins
to
grumble
howsomever
the
master
throws
the
cat
overboard
off
the
and
the
waterman
as
soon
as
he
sees
her
splash
in
the
water
backs
astarn
to
take
her
into
the
boat
but
the
tells
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
if
he
does
want
a
bullet
through
his
boat
so
he
pulls
ahead
again
the
master
fires
first
and
hits
the
cat
a
clip
on
the
neck
which
turns
her
half
over
and
the
fires
his
musket
and
cuts
the
poor
hanimal
right
in
half
by
the
backbone
and
she
sprawls
a
bit
and
then
goes
down
to
the
bottom
shots
both
says
the
never
take
an
observation
of
your
sextant
again
master
and
they
both
laughs
heartily
and
goes
down
the
ladder
to
get
their
dinner
well
sir
i
never
seed
a
ship
company
in
such
a
farmant
or
such
a
nitty
kicked
up
decks
in
my
life
it
was
almost
as
bad
as
a
mutiny
but
they
piped
to
grog
soon
and
the
men
goes
to
their
berths
and
talks
the
matter
over
more
coolly
and
they
all
agrees
that
no
good
would
come
to
the
ship
that
and
very
melancholy
they
were
and
could
forget
it
well
sir
our
sailing
orders
comes
down
the
next
day
and
the
first
cutter
is
sent
on
shore
for
the
captain
and
six
men
out
of
ten
leaves
the
boat
and
i
sure
that
it
war
for
desartion
but
all
along
of
that
cat
being
hove
overboard
and
butchered
in
that
way
for
three
on
were
messmates
of
mine
for
you
know
sir
we
talks
them
matters
over
and
if
they
had
had
a
mind
to
quit
the
sarvice
i
should
have
know
it
the
captain
was
as
savage
as
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
and
did
nothing
but
growl
for
three
days
afterwards
and
it
was
well
to
keep
clear
on
him
for
he
snapped
right
and
left
like
a
mad
dog
i
never
seed
him
in
such
a
humour
afore
except
once
when
he
had
a
foul
wind
well
sir
we
had
been
out
a
week
when
we
falls
in
with
a
large
frigate
and
beats
to
quarters
we
expected
her
to
be
a
frenchman
but
as
soon
as
she
comes
within
gunshot
she
hoists
the
private
signal
and
proves
to
be
the
and
our
senior
officer
the
next
morning
cruising
together
we
sees
a
vessel
and
the
stands
in
on
the
larboard
tack
and
orders
us
by
signal
to
keep
away
and
prevent
his
running
along
the
coast
the
vessel
finding
that
she
could
go
no
way
comes
to
an
anchor
under
a
battery
of
two
guns
and
then
the
commodore
makes
the
signal
for
boats
manned
and
armed
to
cut
her
out
well
sir
our
was
in
his
cot
on
his
beam
ends
with
the
rheumatiz
and
could
go
on
sarvice
so
the
second
and
third
lieutenants
and
master
and
one
of
the
midshipmen
had
command
of
our
four
boats
and
the
commodore
sent
seven
of
the
boats
pulled
in
and
carried
the
vessel
in
good
style
and
there
never
was
a
man
hurt
as
many
boats
as
could
clap
on
her
took
her
in
tow
and
out
she
came
at
the
rate
of
four
knots
an
hour
i
was
coaxswain
of
the
pinnace
which
was
under
the
charge
of
the
master
and
we
were
pulling
on
board
as
all
the
boats
were
wanted
to
tow
and
we
were
about
three
cables
length
ahead
of
the
vessel
when
i
sees
her
aground
upon
a
rock
that
nobody
knows
nothing
about
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
and
i
said
that
she
were
grounded
to
the
master
who
orders
us
to
pull
back
to
the
vessel
to
assist
in
getting
her
off
again
well
sir
we
gets
alongside
of
her
and
finds
that
she
was
off
again
having
only
grazed
the
rock
and
the
boats
towed
her
out
again
with
a
rally
now
the
frenchmen
were
firing
at
us
with
muskets
for
we
had
shut
in
the
battery
and
as
we
were
almost
out
of
the
the
balls
only
pitted
in
the
water
without
doing
any
harm
and
i
was
with
the
master
on
the
my
body
being
just
between
him
and
the
beach
where
they
were
from
it
seemed
mortally
impossible
to
hit
him
except
through
me
howsomever
a
bullet
passes
between
my
arm
just
here
and
my
side
and
striked
him
dead
upon
the
spot
there
war
another
man
hit
out
of
nine
boats
crews
and
i
leave
you
to
guess
whether
the
sailors
did
declare
that
he
got
his
death
all
along
of
murdering
the
cat
well
sir
the
men
thought
as
he
had
that
now
all
was
over
only
jenkins
the
said
he
war
quite
sure
of
that
we
parts
company
with
the
commodore
the
next
day
and
the
day
as
it
turned
out
we
falls
in
with
a
french
frigate
she
had
the
heels
of
us
and
kept
us
at
long
balls
but
we
hoped
to
cut
her
off
from
running
into
brest
if
a
slant
o
wind
favoured
us
and
obligating
her
to
fight
whether
or
no
tom
collins
the
first
lieutenant
was
still
laid
up
in
his
cot
with
the
rheumaticks
but
when
he
hears
of
a
french
frigate
he
gets
up
and
goes
on
deck
but
when
he
gets
there
he
tips
us
a
faint
and
falls
down
on
the
carronade
slide
and
his
hat
rolled
off
his
head
into
the
waist
he
tried
but
he
was
so
weak
that
he
could
get
up
on
his
sticks
again
well
sir
the
captain
goes
up
to
him
and
says
something
about
zeal
and
all
that
and
tells
him
he
must
go
down
below
again
because
quite
incapable
and
orders
the
men
at
the
foremost
carronades
to
take
him
to
his
cot
now
sir
just
as
we
were
handing
him
down
the
ladder
for
i
was
captain
of
the
gun
a
shot
comes
in
at
the
second
port
and
takes
off
his
skull
as
he
lays
in
our
arms
and
never
hurts
another
man
he
was
dead
in
no
time
and
what
was
more
curious
it
was
the
only
shot
that
hit
the
frigate
the
frenchman
got
into
brest
so
it
was
no
action
after
all
so
you
see
mr
macallan
in
two
only
two
men
were
killed
out
of
hundreds
and
they
were
the
two
who
had
killed
the
cat
now
that
what
i
calls
proof
positive
for
i
seed
it
all
with
my
own
eyes
and
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
could
do
the
same
with
regard
to
that
thing
being
a
i
will
marshall
you
shall
see
that
with
your
own
eyes
come
never
see
note
muttered
the
coxswain
replacing
the
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
cheek
note
the
phraseology
of
sailors
has
been
so
caricatured
of
late
that
i
am
afraid
my
story
will
be
considered
as
translated
into
english
seamen
however
must
decide
which
is
correct
chapter
twenty
seven
and
lo
while
he
was
expounding
in
set
terms
the
most
abstruse
of
his
pious
doctrines
the
head
of
the
tub
whereon
the
good
man
stood
gave
way
and
the
preacher
was
lost
from
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
congregation
of
the
reverend
mr
smith
seymour
who
was
always
the
companion
of
captain
m
whenever
either
instruction
or
amusement
was
to
be
gained
now
quitted
the
surveying
party
to
join
macallan
who
still
continued
seated
on
the
rocks
reflecting
upon
the
remarkable
coincidence
which
the
coxswain
had
narrated
sufficient
in
itself
to
confirm
the
superstitious
ideas
of
the
sailors
for
another
century
his
thoughts
naturally
reverted
to
the
other
point
in
which
seafaring
men
are
equally
bigoted
the
disastrous
consequences
of
sailing
on
a
friday
the
origin
of
which
superstition
can
easily
be
traced
to
early
catholicism
when
out
of
respect
for
the
day
of
universal
redemption
they
were
directed
by
their
pastors
to
await
the
morrow
sun
thus
mentally
exclaimed
macallan
has
religion
degenerated
into
superstition
and
that
which
from
the
purity
of
its
origin
would
have
commanded
our
respect
is
now
only
deserving
of
our
contempt
it
is
by
the
motives
that
have
produced
them
that
our
actions
must
be
weighed
that
which
once
was
an
offering
of
religious
veneration
and
love
is
now
a
tribute
to
superstition
and
to
fear
well
seymour
said
he
addressing
his
companion
how
do
you
like
surveying
not
much
the
sun
is
hot
and
the
glare
so
powerful
that
i
am
almost
blind
what
a
pity
it
is
that
we
had
not
some
trees
here
to
shade
us
from
the
heat
i
should
like
to
plant
some
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
may
come
after
us
a
correct
feeling
on
your
part
my
boy
but
no
trees
would
grow
here
at
present
there
is
no
soil
there
is
plenty
of
some
sort
or
other
in
the
part
where
we
have
been
surveying
yes
the
sand
thrown
up
by
the
sea
and
the
particles
of
shells
and
rock
which
have
been
triturated
by
the
wave
or
decomposed
by
the
alternate
action
of
the
elements
but
there
is
no
vegetable
matter
without
which
there
can
be
no
vegetable
produce
observe
willy
the
skeleton
of
this
earth
is
framed
of
rocks
and
mountains
which
have
been
proudly
rearing
their
heads
into
the
clouds
or
lying
in
dark
majesty
beneath
the
seas
since
the
creation
of
the
world
when
they
were
fixed
by
the
almighty
architect
to
remain
till
time
shall
be
no
more
over
them
we
find
the
wrecks
of
a
former
world
once
as
beautiful
as
thickly
peopled
but
more
thoughtless
and
more
wicked
than
the
present
which
was
hurled
into
one
general
chaos
and
its
component
but
incongruous
parts
amalgamated
in
awful
mockery
by
the
deluge
that
tremendous
evidence
of
the
wrath
of
heaven
but
it
has
long
passed
away
and
the
relics
of
former
creation
the
kneaded
mass
of
man
in
his
pride
of
woman
in
her
beauty
of
arts
in
their
splendour
of
vice
in
her
zenith
and
of
virtue
in
her
tomb
we
are
standing
upon
another
teeming
with
life
and
yielding
forth
her
fruits
in
the
season
as
before
but
willy
the
supports
of
life
are
not
to
be
found
in
primeval
rocks
or
antediluvial
remains
it
is
from
the
superficial
covering
the
thin
crust
with
which
the
earth
is
covered
composed
of
the
remains
of
former
existence
of
the
breccia
of
exhausted
nature
that
animal
creation
derives
its
support
and
it
is
the
grand
axiom
of
the
universe
that
life
can
only
be
supported
by
animal
from
the
meanest
insect
that
crawls
upon
the
ground
to
man
in
his
perfection
life
is
supported
and
continued
by
animal
and
vegetable
food
and
it
is
only
the
decayed
matter
returned
to
the
earth
which
enables
the
lofty
cedar
to
extend
its
boughs
or
the
lowly
violet
to
exhale
its
perfume
this
is
a
world
of
eternal
reproduction
and
decay
one
endless
cycle
of
the
living
preying
on
the
dead
a
phoenix
yearly
daily
and
hourly
springing
from
its
ashes
in
renewed
strength
and
beauty
the
blade
of
grass
which
shoots
from
the
soil
flowers
casts
its
seed
and
dies
to
make
room
for
its
offspring
nourished
by
the
relics
of
its
parent
is
a
type
of
the
law
controlling
all
nature
even
to
man
himself
who
must
pass
away
to
make
room
for
the
generation
which
is
to
come
the
boat
which
returning
from
the
ship
appeared
like
a
black
speck
on
the
water
indicated
that
the
was
at
hand
and
price
and
the
purser
who
had
come
on
shore
with
macallan
now
joined
him
and
willy
who
were
sitting
down
on
the
rocks
at
the
water
edge
well
macallan
said
price
it
a
fine
thing
to
be
a
philosopher
what
is
that
which
milton
says
let
me
see
sweet
something
divine
philosophy
i
forget
the
exact
words
well
what
have
you
caught
if
you
caught
nothing
doctor
you
better
off
than
i
am
said
the
purser
wiping
his
brow
for
i
caught
a
headache
i
have
been
very
well
amused
replied
macallan
ay
i
suppose
like
in
the
forest
you
recollect
no
indeed
i
do
not
do
you
bless
my
soul
you
know
sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
everything
i
forget
how
the
lines
run
do
you
recollect
continued
price
speaking
loud
in
the
purser
ear
no
i
never
i
do
understand
these
things
replied
the
purser
taking
his
seat
by
macallan
and
addressing
him
i
can
not
think
what
pleasure
there
can
be
in
poking
about
the
rocks
as
you
do
it
serves
to
amuse
me
you
my
dear
fellow
indeed
i
never
meant
it
i
beg
your
pardon
you
mistook
me
it
was
my
fault
i
did
not
speak
sufficiently
loud
make
no
apology
too
to
make
an
apology
no
indeed
i
only
asked
what
amusement
you
could
find
that
all
what
amusement
replied
macallan
rising
from
his
seat
annoyed
at
these
repeated
attacks
from
all
quarters
upon
his
favourite
study
listen
to
me
and
i
will
explain
to
you
how
investigation
is
the
parent
of
both
amusement
and
instruction
what
is
this
rock
that
i
am
standing
on
has
it
remained
here
for
ages
to
be
dashed
by
the
furious
ocean
or
has
it
lately
sprung
from
the
depths
from
the
silent
labour
of
the
indefatigable
zoophytes
look
at
its
sides
behold
the
variety
of
marine
vegetation
with
which
it
is
loaded
are
they
of
the
class
of
the
ulvae
confervae
or
fuci
to
be
welcomed
as
old
acquaintance
or
hitherto
unnoticed
to
be
added
to
the
catalogue
of
nature
endless
stores
and
what
are
those
corals
that
like
mimic
tenants
of
the
forest
extend
their
graceful
boughs
look
at
the
variety
of
shells
which
are
adhering
to
its
sides
observe
the
patellae
with
what
tenacity
they
cling
to
save
themselves
from
being
washed
into
the
deep
water
and
being
devoured
by
the
fishes
that
are
playing
in
its
chasms
what
a
source
of
endless
amusement
what
a
field
for
deep
reflection
is
there
in
the
investigation
of
this
little
when
you
contemplate
the
instinct
of
the
different
species
the
powers
given
to
them
so
adapted
to
their
wants
and
their
privations
is
not
the
eye
delighted
is
not
the
mind
enlarged
and
are
not
the
feelings
harmonised
study
the
works
of
the
creation
and
you
turn
a
desert
into
a
peopled
city
a
barren
rock
into
a
source
of
admiration
and
delight
nay
search
into
nature
for
a
few
minutes
and
you
rise
a
better
man
dive
into
what
the
conclusion
of
the
doctor
rhapsody
may
have
been
is
not
known
for
stamping
too
energetically
upon
the
seaweed
on
the
edge
of
the
rock
his
foot
slipped
and
he
disappeared
with
the
perpendicular
descent
and
velocity
of
a
lead
into
the
water
alongside
of
it
marshall
the
coxswain
who
had
been
astonished
at
his
speech
to
which
he
had
listened
with
mouth
open
for
want
of
comprehension
quite
forgot
the
respect
due
to
an
officer
at
this
unexpected
finale
watch
there
watch
cried
the
man
and
then
threw
himself
down
and
rolled
in
convulsions
of
laughter
price
and
willy
whose
mirth
was
almost
as
excessive
did
however
run
to
his
assistance
and
caught
him
by
the
collar
as
he
rose
again
to
the
surface
for
it
was
considerably
out
of
his
depth
while
the
deaf
purser
whose
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
ground
in
deep
attention
to
catch
the
doctor
words
and
whose
ears
were
not
sufficiently
acute
to
hear
the
splash
looked
up
as
they
were
going
to
his
assistance
and
asked
with
surprise
where
the
doctor
the
sides
of
the
rock
were
so
slippery
that
the
united
efforts
of
price
and
seymour
whose
powers
were
much
enfeebled
from
extreme
mirth
were
not
sufficient
to
haul
macallan
upon
terra
firma
marshall
come
here
directly
sir
and
help
us
cried
willy
an
order
which
the
coxswain
who
was
sufficiently
recovered
immediately
obeyed
give
me
your
hand
mr
macallan
said
the
man
as
the
surgeon
was
clinging
to
the
seaweed
it
no
use
holding
on
by
them
slippery
now
then
mr
price
all
together
ay
and
as
soon
as
you
please
called
out
the
malicious
boatkeeper
of
the
gig
i
seed
a
large
shark
but
a
minute
ago
quick
quick
roared
the
surgeon
who
already
imagined
his
leg
encircled
by
the
teeth
of
the
ravenous
animal
by
their
united
efforts
macallan
was
at
last
safely
landed
and
after
much
sputtering
blowing
and
puffing
was
about
to
address
the
coxswain
in
no
very
amicable
manner
when
the
purser
interrupted
him
by
the
powers
doctor
but
you
took
the
right
way
to
have
a
close
examination
of
all
those
fine
things
which
you
were
giving
us
a
catalogue
of
but
now
give
us
the
remainder
of
your
speech
you
gave
us
a
practical
illustration
of
diving
what
sort
of
sensation
was
it
doctor
said
price
you
recollect
shakespeare
and
methinks
what
pain
it
was
to
drown
let
me
see
something
pray
do
tax
your
memory
price
it
something
like
our
country
past
all
further
taxation
that
the
severest
thing
you
said
since
we
sailed
together
you
out
of
humour
doctor
well
you
know
what
shakespeare
says
never
yet
was
found
a
philosopher
something
about
the
toothache
i
forget
the
words
these
attacks
did
not
at
all
tend
to
restore
the
equanimity
of
the
doctor
temper
which
it
must
be
acknowledged
had
some
excuse

proved
himself

made
no

the
boat
pulled
in
and
the
party
returned
on
board
and

macallan
had
divested
himself
of
his
uncomfortable
attire
and
joined
his
messmates
at

had
recovered
his

serenity

the
survey
was
continued
one
morning
after
a
fatiguing
walk
from
point
to
point
occasionally
crossing
from
one
islet
to
the
others
in
the
boats
the
party
collected
under
a
projecting
rock
which
screened
them
from
the
rays
of
the
vertical
sun
and
the
repast
which
had
been
brought
from
the
ship
in
the
morning
was
spread
before
them
the
party
consisted
of
captain
m
pearce
the
master
the
surgeon
who
had
accompanied
them
to
explore
the
natural
productions
of
the
reef
and
the
confidential
clerk
of
captain
m
a
man
of
the
name
of
collier
who
had
been
many
years
in
his
service
and
who
was
now
employed
in
noting
down
the
angles
taken
with
the
theodolite
tired
with
the
labours
of
the
morning
captain
m
did
not
rise
immediately
after
their
meal
had
been
despatched
but
entered
into
conversation
with
the
surgeon
who
was
looking
over
the
memoranda
which
he
had
made
relative
to
the
natural
history
of
the
reef
do
you
intend
to
write
a
book
mr
macallan
that
you
have
collected
so
many
remarks
indeed
i
do
not
sir
i
have
no
ambition
to
be
an
author
the
clerk
who
was
very
taciturn
in
general
and
seldom
spoke
unless
on
points
connected
with
his
duty
joined
the
conversation
by
addressing
the
surgeon
it
a
service
of
danger
sir
and
you
must
be
prepared
to
meet
the
attacks
both
of
authors
and
reviewers
of
reviewers
i
can
imagine
replied
macallan
but
why
of
authors
that
depends
very
much
whether
you
tread
over
beaten
ground
or
strike
into
a
new
path
in
the
latter
case
you
will
be
pretty
safe
from
both
as
the
authors
will
be
and
the
reviewers
in
all
probability
and
why
if
i
enter
upon
a
beaten
track
which
i
presume
infers
a
style
of
writing
in
which
others
have
preceded
me
because
sir
when
a
new
author
makes
his
appearance
he
is
much
in
the
same
situation
as
a
strange
dog
entering
a
kennel
preoccupied
by
many
others
he
is
immediately
attacked
and
worried
by
the
rest
until
either
by
boldly
defending
himself
or
pertinaciously
refusing
to
quit
he
eventually
obtains
a
domiciliation
and
becomes
an
acknowledged
member
of
the
fraternity
why
mr
collier
observed
the
captain
you
seem
to
be
quite
as
to
literary
arrangements
i
ought
to
be
sir
replied
the
clerk
for
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
attempted
to
become
an
author
and
practised
as
a
reviewer
indeed
and
did
you
fail
in
your
attempt
at
authorship
my
work
was
never
printed
sir
for
no
bookseller
would
undertake
to
publish
it
i
tried
the
whole
town
no
man
would
give
himself
the
trouble
to
look
over
the
ms
it
was
said
that
the
public
taste
was
not
that
way
and
that
it
would
not
do
at
last
i
received
a
letter
of
introduction
from
an
old
acquaintance
to
his
uncle
who
was
a
literary
character
he
certainly
did
read
some
parts
of
my
performance
and
what
then
why
sir
he
shook
his
head
told
me
with
a
sneer
that
as
an
author
i
should
never
succeed
but
he
added
with
a
sort
of
encouraging
smile
that
from
some
parts
of
the
ms
which
he
had
perused
he
thought
that
he
could
find
employment
for
me
in
the
reviewing
line
if
i
chose
to
undertake
it
my
pride
was
hurt
and
i
answered
that
i
could
not
agree
with
him
as
i
considered
that
it
required
the
ability
to
write
a
book
yourself
to
enable
you
to
decide
upon
the
merits
of
others
well
i
must
say
that
i
agree
with
you
replied
the
captain
proceed
in
your
story
for
i
am
interested
my
friend
answered
no
means
my
dear
sir
a
bad
generally
makes
a
good
indeed
sir
to
be
candid
with
you
i
never
allow
any
gentleman
to
review
for
me
unless
he
has
met
with
a
misfortune
similar
to
yours
it
is
one
of
the
necessary
qualifications
of
a
good
reviewer
that
he
should
have
failed
as
an
author
for
without
the
exacerbated
feelings
arising
from
disappointment
he
would
not
possess
gall
sufficient
for
his
task
and
his
conscience
would
stand
in
his
way
when
he
was
writing
against
it
if
he
were
not
spurred
on
by
the
keen
probes
of
envy
and
he
convinced
you
my
poverty
did
sir
if
he
did
not
i
worked
many
months
for
him
but
i
had
better
have
earned
my
bread
as
a
common
labourer
reviews
ought
to
pay
well
too
observed
macallan
they
are
periodicals
in
great
demand
they
are
so
replied
captain
m
and
the
reasons
are
obvious
few
people
take
the
trouble
to
think
for
themselves
but
on
the
contrary
are
very
glad
to
find
others
who
will
think
for
them
some
can
not
find
time
to
read
others
will
not
find
it
a
review
removes
all
these
difficulties
gives
the
busy
world
an
insight
into
what
is
going
on
in
the
literary
world
and
enables
the
lounger
not
to
appear
wholly
ignorant
of
a
work
the
merits
of
which
may
happen
to
be
discussed
but
what
is
the
consequence
that
of
the
town
are
led
by
the
nose
by
this
or
that
periodical
work
having
wholly
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
reviews
are
far
from
being
gospel
indeed
i
do
not
know
any
set
of
men
so
likely
to
err
as
reviewers
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
class
of
people
so
irascible
so
full
of
party
feeling
so
disgraced
by
envy
as
authors
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
seem
to
preside
over
science
their
political
opinions
step
in
and
increase
the
undue
preponderance
and
to
crown
all
they
are
more
influenced
by
money
being
proverbially
more
in
want
of
it
than
others
how
then
is
it
to
be
expected
that
reviews
can
be
impartial
i
seldom
read
them
myself
as
i
consider
that
it
is
better
to
know
nothing
than
to
be
misled
and
if
it
is
a
fair
question
mr
collier
continued
captain
m
in
what
manner
were
you
employed
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
sir
i
was
a
mere
automaton
a
machine
in
the
hands
of
others
a
new
publication
was
sent
to
me
with
a
private
mark
from
my
employer
directing
the
quantum
of
praise
or
censure
which
it
was
to
incur
if
the
former
were
allotted
to
it
the
best
passages
were
selected
if
condemned
to
the
latter
all
the
worst
the
connecting
parts
of
the
review
were
made
up
from
a
commonplace
book
in
which
by
turning
to
any
subject
you
found
the
general
heads
and
extracts
from
the
works
of
others
which
you
were
directed
to
alter
so
as
to
retain
the
ideas
but
disguise
the
style
that
it
might
appear
original
are
you
aware
of
the
grounds
of
praise
or
abuse
for
it
appears
that
those
who
directed
the
censure
did
not
read
the
publications
the
grounds
were
various
books
printed
by
a
bookseller
to
whom
my
master
had
a
dislike
were
sure
to
be
run
down
on
the
contrary
those
published
by
his
connections
or
friends
were
as
much
applauded
moreover
the
influence
of
authors
who
were
afraid
of
a
successful
rival
in
their
own
line
often
damned
a
work
but
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
reviews
are
conducted
with
such
want
of
principle
by
no
means
there
are
many
very
impartial
and
clever
critiques
the
misfortune
is
that
unless
you
read
the
work
that
is
reviewed
you
can
not
distinguish
one
from
the
other
and
pray
what
induced
you
to
abandon
this
creditable
employment
a
quarrel
sir
i
had
reviewed
a
work
with
the
private
mark
of
approval
when
it
was
found
out
to
be
a
mistake
and
i
was
desired
to
review
it
with
censure
i
expected
to
be
paid
for
the
second
review
as
well
as
for
the
first
my
employer
thought
proper
to
consider
it
all
as
one
job
and
refused
so
we
parted
pretty
tricks
in
trade
indeed
replied
captain
m
why
mr
collier
you
appear
to
have
belonged
to
a
gang
of
literary
bravos
whose
pens
like
stilettoes
were
always
ready
to
stab
in
the
dark
the
unfortunate
individuals
who
might
be
pointed
out
to
them
by
interest
or
revenge
i
acknowledge
the
justice
of
your
remark
sir
all
that
i
can
offer
in
my
defence
is
the
excuse
of
the
libeller
to
cardinal
richelieu
faut
vivre
and
i
answer
you
with
the
cardinal
ne
vois
pas
la
replied
captain
m
with
a
smile
as
he
rose
to
resume
his
labours
chapter
twenty
nine
he
fell
and
deadly
pale
groaned
out
his
soul
milton
do
mamma
come
here
said
emily
as
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
of
an
inn
on
the
road
where
they
had
stopped
to
take
some
refreshment
do
come
and
see
what
a
pretty
lady
is
in
the
chariot
which
has
stopped
at
the
door
mrs
rainscourt
complied
with
her
daughter
request
and
acknowledged
the
justice
of
the
remark
when
she
saw
the
expressive
countenance
of
susan
now
mrs
mcelvina
who
was
listening
to
the
proposal
of
her
husband
that
they
should
alight
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
susan
consented
and
was
followed
by
old
hornblow
who
pulling
out
his
watch
from
his
white
cassimere
which
he
had
continued
to
wear
ever
since
the
day
of
the
wedding
declared
that
they
must
stop
to
dine
this
country
air
makes
one
confoundedly
hungry
said
the
old
man
i
declare
i
never
had
such
an
appetite
in
susan
my
dear
order
something
that
wo
take
long
in
cooking
a
if
they
have
nothing
down
at
the
fire
mrs
rainscourt
who
was
as
much
prepossessed
with
the
appearance
of
mcelvina
as
with
that
of
his
wife
gave
vent
to
her
thoughts
with
i
wonder
who
they
are
her
maid
who
was
in
the
room
took
this
as
a
hint
to
obtain
the
gratification
of
her
mistress
curiosity
as
well
as
her
own
and
proceeded
accordingly
on
her
voyage
of
discovery
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
having
boarded
the
abigail
of
mrs
mcelvina
just
as
she
was
coming
to
an
anchor
inside
the
bar
and
having
made
an
interchange
of
intelligence
with
a
rapidity
incredible
to
those
who
are
not
aware
of
the
velocity
of
communication
between
this
description
of
people
the
parlour
to
make
a
report
to
her
commanding
officer
precisely
at
the
same
moment
that
susan
maid
was
delivering
her
cargo
of
intelligence
to
her
own
mistress
they
are
a
couple
and
their
name
is
mcelvina
said
the
one
the
lady
is
a
mrs
rainscourt
and
the
young
lady
is
her
daughter
and
a
great
heiress
whispered
the
other
they
have
purchased
the
hunting
box
close
to
the
hall
and
are
going
there
now
said
the
first
they
live
at
the
great
park
close
to
where
you
are
going
said
the
second
the
old
gentleman
name
is
hornblow
he
is
the
lady
father
and
as
rich
as
a
jew
they
say
continued
mrs
rainscourt
maid
mrs
rainscourt
do
live
with
her
husband
by
all
accounts
he
a
bad
continued
the
abigail
of
susan
the
publicity
of
the
staircase
of
an
hotel
is
very
convenient
for
making
an
acquaintance
and
it
happened
that
just
after
these
communications
had
been
made
emily
was
ascending
the
stairs
as
mrs
mcelvina
was
going
down
to
join
her
husband
and
father
at
the
dinner
table
the
smiling
face
and
beaming
eyes
of
emily
who
evidently
lingered
to
be
spoken
to
were
so
engaging
that
she
soon
found
her
way
into
the
room
which
the
mcelvinas
were
occupying
mrs
rainscourt
was
not
sorry
to
find
that
she
was
to
have
for
neighbours
a
couple
whose
appearance
had
so
prepossessed
her
in
their
favour
as
she
expected
that
her
society
would
be
rather
confined
she
did
not
suffer
to
escape
the
favourable
opportunity
which
presented
itself
of
making
their
acquaintance
as
they
were
returning
to
their
vehicles
emily
ran
to
mrs
mcelvina
to
wish
her
and
mrs
rainscourt
expressed
her
thanks
for
the
notice
they
had
taken
of
her
daughter
a
few
minutes
conversation
ended
in
hoping
to
have
the
pleasure
of
making
their
acquaintance
as
soon
as
they
were
settled
the
carriages
drove
off
and
we
shall
follow
that
of
the
mcelvinas
which
arrived
at
its
destination
late
in
the
evening
without
any
accident
the
as
all
houses
with
verandas
and
french
windows
are
now
designated
which
hornblow
had
purchased
was
for
a
wonder
quite
as
complete
as
described
in
the
particulars
of
sale
it
had
the
sloping
lawn
in
front
the
three
acres
more
or
less
of
plantation
and
pleasure
ground
tastefully
laid
out
and
planted
with
thriving
young
trees
the
capital
walled
gardens
stocked
with
the
choicest
fruit
trees
in
full
bearing
abundant
springs
of
the
finest
water
stabling
for
six
horses
and
the
dimensions
of
the
conservatory
and
rooms
in
the
interior
of
the
house
were
quite
correct
and
the
land
attached
to
it
was
according
to
the
accompanying
plan
and
divided
into
parcels
designated
by
the
rural
terms
of
homestead
field
etcetera
etcetera
in
short
it
was
a
very
eligible
purchase
and
a
very
pretty
and
retired
domicile
and
when
our
party
arrived
the
flowers
seemed
to
yield
a
more
grateful
perfume
the
trees
appeared
more
umbrageous
and
the
verdure
of
the
meadows
of
a
more
refreshing
green
from
the
contrast
with
so
many
hours
travelling
upon
a
dusty
road
during
a
sultry
day
oh
how
beautiful
these
roses
are
do
look
my
dear
father
they
are
indeed
replied
old
hornblow
delighted
at
the
happy
face
of
his
daughter
but
i
should
like
some
tea
susan
i
am
not
used
to
so
much
jumbling
i
feel
tired
and
shall
go
to
bed
early
tea
was
accordingly
prepared
soon
after
which
the
old
gentleman
rose
to
retire
well
said
he
as
he
lighted
his
chamber
candle
i
suppose
i
am
settled
here
for
life
but
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
myself
i
must
make
acquaintance
with
all
the
flowers
and
all
the
trees
the
budding
of
the
spring
will
make
me
think
of
grandchildren
the
tree
clothed
in
its
beauty
of
you
and
the
fall
of
the
leaf
of
myself
i
must
count
the
poultry
and
look
after
the
pigs
and
see
the
cows
milked
i
was
fond
of
the
little
parlour
in
because
i
had
sat
in
it
so
long
and
i
suppose
that
i
shall
get
fond
of
this
place
too
if
i
find
enough
to
employ
and
amuse
me
but
you
must
be
quick
and
give
me
a
grandchild
susan
and
then
i
shall
nurse
him
all
day
long
good
night
god
bless
you
my
dear
good
night
good
night
my
dear
sir
replied
susan
who
had
coloured
deeply
at
the
request
which
he
had
made
good
night
mcelvina
my
boy
this
is
the
first
night
we
pass
under
this
roof
may
we
live
many
happy
years
in
it
and
old
hornblow
left
the
room
and
ascended
the
stairs
mcelvina
had
encircled
susan
waist
with
his
arm
and
was
probably
about
to
utter
some
wish
in
unison
with
that
of
her
father
when
the
noise
of
a
heavy
fall
sounded
in
their
ears
good
heaven
cried
susan
it
is
my
father

one
sunday
forenoon
as

was
performing

the
man
at

hailed
the

with
a
strange
sail
on

may
be
shocked
to
hear
that
the

was

closed

captain

was
aware
from
the
fidgeting
of
the
ship
company
upon
the
capstan
bars
on
which
they
were
seated
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
regain
their
attention
to
the
service
even
if
he
had
felt
inclined
to
proceed

he
well
knew
that
any
worship
of
god
in
which
the
mind
and
heart
were
not
engaged
was
but
an
idle
ceremony
if
not
a
solemn
mockery
the
hands
were
turned
up
all
sail
was
made
and
in
an
hour
the
stranger
was
to
be
seen
with
the
naked

from
the
what
do
you
make
of
her

the

replied
jerry

was
aware
that
a

in

would
not

him
thirty
shillings

sent

in

the

neared
the

so
as
to
distinguish
her
from

the

bore
down

with

yes
you
booby
i
did
well
now
i
do
declare
cried
prose
with
dismay
if
i
have
lost

pounds
the
vessel
ran
under
the
stern
of
the
frigate
and
requested
a
boat
to
be
sent
on
board
as
she
had
intelligence
to
communicate
the
boat
returned
and
acquainted
captain
m
that
the
vessel
had
been
boarded
and
plundered
by
a
french
privateer
schooner
which
had
committed
great
depredation
in
that
quarter
and
that
it
was
not
above
eight
hours
that
she
had
left
her
and
made
sail
towards
porto
rico
taking
out
two
merchants
who
were
passengers
the
boat
was
immediately
hoisted
up
and
all
sail
made
in
the
direction
of
the
island
which
was
not
above
fifteen
leagues
distant
as
the
day
closed
in
their
eyes
were
gratified
by
the
sight
of
the
schooner
becalmed
close
in
under
the
land
perceiving
the
frigate
in
pursuit
of
her
and
unable
to
escape
she
came
to
an
anchor
in
a
small
and
shallow
bay
within
a
length
of
the
beach
captain
m
having
run
his
ship
as
close
in
as
the
depth
of
water
would
permit
which
was
between
two
and
three
miles
of
her
so
as
to
render
her
escape
impossible
came
to
an
anchor
signifying
to
his
officers
his
determination
to
cut
her
out
with
his
boats
on
the
ensuing
day
the
officers
who
were
to
be
intrusted
with
the
command
of
the
boats
and
the
crews
which
were
to
be
employed
on
the
service
were
selected
and
mustered
on
the
previous
to
the
hammocks
being
piped
down
that
the
former
might
hold
themselves
in
readiness
and
that
the
latter
might
remain
in
their
hammocks
during
the
night
all
was
anxiety
for
the
sun
to
rise
again
upon
those
who
were
about
to
venture
in
the
lottery
where
the
prizes
would
be
honour
and
the
blanks
death
there
were
but
few
whose
souls
were
of
that
decided
brute
composition
that
they
could
sleep
through
the
whole
of
the
tedious
night
they
woke
and
swore
a
prayer
or
two
then
slept
again
the
sun
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
above
the
horizon
although
the
eastern
blush
announced
that
the
spinning
earth
would
shortly
whirl
the
into
his
presence
when
the
pipes
of
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
with
the
summons
of
all
hands
ahoy
up
all
hammocks
were
obeyed
with
the
alacrity
so
characteristic
of
english
seamen
anticipating
danger
the
hammocks
were
soon
stowed
and
the
hands
turned
up
out

the
yard
tackles
and
stays
were
hooked
and
the
larger
boats
from
the
booms
descended
with
a
heavy
splash
into
the
water

they
threw
out
on
each
side
of
them

they
displaced
it
with
their
weight

the
cutters
from

were
already
lowered
down
and
were
being
manned

chains

discovered
the
privateer
who
aware
of
their
intentions
had
employed
the
night
in
taking
every
precaution

could

fainting

was
pierced

side

the
guns
which
pointed
through
them
with
the
tompions
out
ready
to
shower
destruction
upon

assailants
showed
like
the
teeth
of
the
snarling
wolf
who
stands
at
bay
awaiting
the
attack
of
his
undaunted
pursuers
the

gentlemen
said
captain
m
as
they
stood
round
the
table
in
the
waiting
for
his
communication
i
must
call
your
attention
to
a
few
points
which
it
is
my
wish
that
you
should
bear
in
remembrance
now
that
you
are
about
to
proceed
upon
what
will
in
all
likelihood
prove
to
be
an
arduous
service
this
vessel
has
already
done
so
much
mischief
that
i
conceive
it
my
duty
to
capture
her
if
possible
and
although
there
is
no
service
in
which
generally
speaking
there
is
so
great
a
sacrifice
of
life
in
proportion
to
the
object
to
be
attained
as
that
which
is
generally
termed
out
yet
rather
than
she
should
escape
to
the
further
injury
of
our
trade
i
have
determined
to
have
recourse
to
the
measure
but
gentlemen
and
to
you
mr
price
as
commanding
the
expedition
i
particularly
address
myself
recollect
that
even
in
this
extreme
case
without
proper
arrangement
we
may
not
only
purchase
our
victory
too
dear
but
may
even
sacrifice
a
number
of
lives
without
succeeding
in
our
attempt
of
your
courage
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
let
it
be
remembered
that
it
is
something
more
than
mere
animal
courage
which
i
expect
in
the
behaviour
of
my
officers
if
nothing
more
were
required
the
command
of
these
boats
might
be
as
safely
intrusted
to
any
of
the
foremast
men
who
like
the
bulldogs
of
our
country
will
thrust
their
heads
into
the
lion
jaw
with
perfect
indifference
what
i
require
and
expect
and
will
have
from
every
officer
who
looks
for
promotion
from
my
recommendation
is
what
i
term
conduct
by
which
i
would
imply
that
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
which
enable
him
to
calculate
chances
in
the
midst
of
danger
to
take
advantage
of
a
favourable
opportunity
in
the
heat
of
an
engagement
and
to
restrain
the
impetuosity
of
those
who
have
fallen
into
the
dangerous
error
of
despising
their
enemy
of
such
conduct
the
most
favourable
construction
that
can
be
put
upon
it
is
that
it
is
only
preferable
to
indecision
in
a
service
of
this
description
even
with
the
greatest
courage
and
prudence
united
some
loss
must
necessarily
be
expected
to
take
place
and
there
is
no
providing
against
unforeseen
accidents
but
if
i
find
that
by
rash
and
injudicious
behaviour
a
greater
sacrifice
is
made
than
there
is
a
necessity
for
depend
upon
it
that
i
shall
not
fail
to
let
that
officer
know
the
high
value
at
which
i
estimate
the
life
of
a
british
sailor
with
this
caution
i
shall
now
give
you
my
ideas
as
to
what
appears
the
most
eligible
plan
of
insuring
success
i
have
made
a
rough
sketch
on
this
paper
which
will
assist
my
explanation
captain
m
then
entered
into
the
plan
of
attack
pointing
out
the
precautions
which
should
be
taken
etcetera
and
concluded
by
observing
that
they
were
by
no
means
to
consider
themselves
as
fettered
by
what
he
had
proposed
but
merely
to
regard
them
as
hints
to
guide
their
conduct
if
found
preferable
to
any
others
which
might
be
suggested
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
service
and
the
measures
adopted
by
the
enemy
the
officers
returned
on
deck
and
descended
into
their
respective
boats
where
they
found
many
of
the
younger
midshipmen
who
although
not
selected
for
the
service
had
smuggled
themselves
into
the
boats
that
they
might
be
participators
in
the
conflict
captain
m
although
he
did
not
send
them
on
the
service
had
no
objection
to
their
going
and
therefore
pretended
not
to
see
them
when
he
looked
over
the
side
and
desired
the
boats
to
shove
off
directly
the
order
was
given
the
remainder
of
the
ship
company
mounted
the
rigging
and
saluted
them
with
three
cheers
the
boats
crews
tossed
their
oars
while
the
cheers
were
given
and
returned
the

number
the

of

dashed
up

over

astern
the

in

fired
her
two
long

cutter
was
on
shore
before
the
gun
could
be
reloaded
and
fired
a
second
time
the
crew
with
the
officer
at
their
head
were
seen
to
clamber
up
the
rock
in
a
minute
they
returned
and
jumping
into
the
boat
pulled
off
to
give
their
aid
to
the
capture
of
the
vessel
he
has
spiked
the
gun
i
am
certain
observed
captain
m
before
the
cutter
could
regain
her
station
the
other
boats
were
summoned
by
the
bugle
in
the
launch
and
with
loud
cheering
pulled
up
together
to
the
attack
the
booms
which
had
been
rigged
out
to
prevent
them
from
coming
alongside
already
shot
through
by
the
grape
from
the
launch
offered
but
little
resistance
to
the
impetus
with
which
the
boats
were
forced
against
them
they
either
broke
in
two
or
sank
under
water
there
hurrah
cried
all
the
men
who
remained
in
the
cheering
those
who
heard
them
not
but
i
must
transport
the
reader
to
the
scene
of
slaughter
for
if
he
remains
on
board
of
the
he
will
distinguish
nothing
but
fire
and
smoke
do
be
afraid
ladies
if
i
take
you
on
board
of
the
schooner
these
our
actors
are
all
air
thin
air
raised
by
the
magic
pen
for
your
amusement
come
then
fearlessly
with
me
and
view
the
scene
of
mortal
strife
the
launch
has
boarded
on
the
starboard
gangway
and
it
is
against
her
that
the
crew
of
the
privateer
have
directed
their
main
efforts
the
boarding
nettings
can
not
be
divided
and
the
men
are
thrown
back
wounded
or
dead
into
the
boat
the
crew
of
the
pinnace
are
attempting
the
bows
with
indifferent
success
some
have
already
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
their
valour
none
have
yet
succeeded
in
gaining
a
footing
on
deck
while
the
marines
are
resisting
with
their
bayonets
the
thrusts
of
the
boarding
pikes
which
are
protruded
through
the
ports
courtenay
has
not
yet
boarded
in
the
barge
for
on
pulling
up
on
the
quarter
he
perceived
that
on
the
larboard
side
of
the
vessel
the
boarding
nettings
had
either
been
neglected
to
be
properly
triced
up
or
had
been
cut
away
by
the
fire
from
the
boats
he
has
pushed
alongside
to
take
advantage
of
the
opening
and
the
two
cutters
have
followed
him
they
board
with
little
resistance
the
enemy
are
too
busy
repelling
the
attacks
on
the
other
side
and
as
his
men
pour
upon
the
deck
the
crews
of
the
launch
and
pinnace
tired
with
their
vain
endeavours
to
divide
the
nettings
and
rendered
desperate
by
their
loss
have
run
up
the
fore
and
main
rigging
above
the
nettings
and
thrown
themselves
down
cutlass
in
hand
into
the
below
careless
of
the
points
of
the
weapons
which
may
meet
them
in
their
descent
now
is
the
struggle
for
life
or
death
courtenay
who
was
daring
as
man
could
be
but
not
of
a
very
athletic
frame
reclimbed
from
the
main
chains
of
the
vessel
into
which
he
had
already
once
fallen
from
one
of
his
own
seamen
having
inadvertently
made
use
of
his
shoulder
as
a
step
to
assist
his
own
ascent
he
was
overtaken
by
robinson
the
coxswain
of
the
cutter
who
sprang
up
with
all
the
ardour
and
activity
of
an
english
sailor
who
meant
mischief
and
pleased
with
the
energy
of
his
officer
forgetting
at
the
moment
the
respect
due
to
his
rank
called
out
to
him
by
the
with
which
he
had
been
christened
by
the
men
bravo
that
your
sort
what
that
sir
cried
courtenay
making
a
spring
so
as
to
stand
on
the
of
the
vessel
at
the
same
moment
with
the
coxswain
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
i
say
robinson
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
continued
the
lieutenant
wholly
regardless
of
the
situation
they
were
placed
in
the
coxswain
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
at
the
same
moment
parried
off
with
his
cutlass
a
thrust
of
a
pike
at
courtenay
which
in
all
probability
would
otherwise
have
prevented
his
asking
any
more
questions
then
without
making
any
answer
sprang
down
on
the
deck
into
the
midst
of
the
affray
you
robinson
come
back
cried
courtenay
after
him
damned
annoying
indeed
continued
he
as
following
the
example
of
the
coxswain
he
proceeded
to
vent
his
bile
for
the
present
on
the
heads
of
the
frenchmen
in
most
instances
of
boarding
but
more
especially
in
boarding
small
vessels
there
is
not
much
opportunity
for
what
is
termed
fighting
it
is
a
rush
for
the
deck
breast
to
breast
thigh
to
thigh
foot
to
foot
man
wedged
against
man
so
pressed
on
by
those
behind
that
there
is
little
possibility
of
using
your
cutlass
except
by
driving
your
antagonist
teeth
down
his
throat
with
the
hilt
wounds
of
course
take
place
throughout
the
whole
of
the
combat
but
those
from
the
sabre
and
the
cutlass
are
generally
given
and
received
before
the
close
or
after
the
resistance
of
one
party
has
yielded
to
the
pertinacity
and
courage
of
the
other
the
crews
of
the
barge
and
cutters
having
gained
possession
of
the
deck
in
the
rear
of
the
enemy
the
affair
was
decided
much
sooner
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
for
the
french
fought
with
desperation
and
were
commanded
by
a
most
gallant
and
enterprising
captain
in
three
minutes
the
crew
of
the
privateer
were
either
beaten
below
or
forced
overboard
and
the
colours
hauled
down
from
the
announced
to
captain
m
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
the
welcome
intelligence
that
the
privateer
was
in
the
possession
of
their
gallant
shipmates
the
hatches
were
secured
and
the
panting
englishmen
for
a
few
minutes
desisted
from
their
exertions
that
they
might
recover
their
breath
after
which
price
gave
directions
for
the
cables
and
hawser
to
be
cut
and
the
boats
to
go
ahead
and
tow
the
vessel
out
they
are
firing
musketry
from
the
shore
they
just
hit
one
of
our
men
said
the
coxswain
of
the
pinnace
then
cast
off
and
bring
your
gun
to
bear
astern
if
you
do
not
hit
them
at
least
they
will
not
be
so
steady
in
their
aim
as
soon
as
we
are
out
of
pull
out
to
us
the
order
was
executed
whilst
the
other
boats
towed
the
privateer
towards
the
frigate
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
out
of
the
pinnace
returned
and
they
had
leisure
to
examine
into
the
loss
which
they
had
sustained
in
the
conflict
the
launch
had
suffered
most
nine
of
her
crew
were
either
killed
or
wounded
three
seamen
and
four
marines
had
suffered
in
the
other
boats
of
the
privateer
men
were
stretched
on
the
decks
either
dead
or
unable
to
rise
those
who
had
not
been
severely
hurt
had
escaped
below
with
the
rest
of
the
crew
price
was
standing
at
the
wheel
his
sabre
not
yet
sheathed
with
courtenay
at
his
side
when
his
inveterate
habit
returned
and
he
commenced
do
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
so
do
i
and
devilish
glad
that
it
over
cried
jerry
coming
forward
from
the
taffrail
with
a
cutlass
in
hand
which
although
he
could
wield
he
could
certainly
not
have
done
much
execution
with
why
how
came
you
here
mr
jerry
inquired
courtenay
oh
stewart
brought
me
in
his
boat
with
the
hopes
of
getting
rid
of
me
but
i
shall
live
to
plague
him
yet
you
are
not
hurt
seymour
i
hope
said
price
to
our
hero
who
now
joined
the
party
and
whose
clothes
were
stained
with
blood
no
replied
seymour
smiling
it
not
my
blood
it
stewart
i
have
been
binding
up
his
head
he
has
a
very
deep
cut
on
the
forehead
and
a
in
his
neck
but
i
think
neither
of
the
wounds
is
of
much
consequence
where
is
he
in
the
cutter
i
desired
them
to
put
the
wounded
man
in
her
out
of
the
launch
and
to
pull
on
board
at
once
was
not
i
right
yes
most
assuredly
i
should
have
thought
of
it
myself
well
jerry
said
seymour
laughing
how
many
did
you
i
did
not
count
them
but
if
you
meet
with
any
chaps
with
deeper
wounds
than
usual
put
them
down
to
me
do
you
know
mr
price
you
are
more
indebted
to
me
than
you
may
imagine
for
the
success
of
this
affair
how
mr
jerry
i
should
like
to
know
that
i
may
prove
my
gratitude
out
of
the
thirteen
you
paid
i
no
doubt
it
was
not
altogether
that
i
frightened
them
more
than
i
hurt
them
for
when
they
would
have
returned
the
blows
from
this
stalwart
arm
said
jerry
holding
out
the
member
in
question
which
was
about
the
thickness
of
a
large
carrot
i
immediately
turned
edgeways
to
them
and
was
invisible
they
thought
that
they
had
to
deal
with
either
a
ghost
or
a
magician
and
depend
upon
it
it
unnerved
them
thou
like
what
is
it
resumed
price
something
horrible
shadow
unreal
mockery
hence
pretty
names
to
be
called
in
reward
of
my
services
cried
jerry
i
presume
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
gratitude
you
were
talking
about
well
after
all
to
take
a
leaf
out
of
your
book
mr
price
i
consider
that
the
better
part
of
valour
is
discretion
now
that
fellow
stewart
he
actually
gave
them
his
head
to
play
with
and
i
am
not
sorry
that
he
has
had
it
broken
for
i
calculate
that
i
shall
be
saved
at
least
a
dozen
thrashings
by
some
of
his
hot
blood
being
let
out
king
poor
cousin
by
the
bye
i
quite
forgot
where
robinson
the
coxswain
of
the
cutter
demanded
courtenay
between
the
guns
forward
seriously
hurt
poor
fellow
i
am
afraid
answered
seymour
i
very
sorry
for
that
i
go
and
see
him
i
wish
to
speak
with
him
replied
courtenay
walking
forward
robinson
was
lying
near
the
long
brass
gun
which
was
pointed
out
of
the
foremost
port
his
head
pillowed
upon
the
body
of
the
french
captain
who
had
fallen
by
his
hand
just
before
he
had
received
his
mortal
wound
a
had
entered
his
groin
and
divided
the
iliac
artery
he
was
bleeding
to
death
nothing
could
save
him
the
cold
perspiration
on
his
forehead
and
the
glassy
appearance
of
his
eye
too
plainly
indicated
that
he
had
but
a
few
minutes
to
live
courtenay
shocked
at
the
condition
of
the
poor
fellow
who
was
not
only
the
most
humorous
but
one
of
the
ablest
seamen
in
the
ship
knelt
down
on
one
knee
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
how
do
you
feel
robinson
are
you
in
much
pain
none
at
all
sir
thank
ye
replied
the
man
faintly
but
the
purser
may
chalk
me
down
as
soon
as
he
pleases
i
suppose
he
cheat
government
out
of
our
day
grub
though
continued
the
man
with
a
smile
courtenay
aware
of
the
truth
of
the
first
observation
thought
it
no
kindness
to
attempt
to
deceive
a
dying
man
with
hopes
of
recovery
in
his
last
moments
he
therefore
continued
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
you
robinson
is
there
any
thing
i
can
do
when
you
are
gone
nothing
at
all
sir
i
neither
chick
nor
child
nor
relation
that
i
know
of
yes
there
is
one
thing
sir
but
it
on
the
bloody
side
the
key
of
the
mess
chest
is
in
my
trousers
pocket
i
wish
recollect
to
have
it
taken
out
and
given
to
john
williams
you
must
wait
till
i
dead
for
i
ca
turn
myself
just
now
it
shall
be
attended
to
replied
courtenay
and
mr
courtenay
remember
me
to
the
captain
is
there
any
thing
else
continued
courtenay
who
perceived
that
the
man
was
sinking
rapidly
nothing
nothing
sir
replied
robinson
very
faintly
god
bless
you
sir
i
going
fast
now
but
robinson
said
courtenay
in
a
low
soothing
voice
bending
nearer
to
him
tell
me
my
good
fellow
i
am
not
the
least
angry
tell
me
why
did
you
call
me
the
man
turned
his
eyes
up
to
him
and
a
smile
played
upon
his
features
as
if
he
was
pleased
with
the
idea
of
disappointing
the
curiosity
of
his
officer
he
made
no
answer
his
head
fell
back
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
had
breathed
his
last
poor
fellow
he
is
gone
said
courtenay
with
a
deep
sigh
as
he
rose
up
from
the
body
never
answered
my
question
too
well
continued
he
as
he
walked
slowly
aft
now
that
what
i
consider
to
be
most
excessively
annoying
by
this
time
the
privateer
had
been
towed
under
the
stern
of
the
frigate
and
a
hawser
was
sent
on
board
to
secure
her
astern
price
and
the
other
officers
returned
on
board
where
they
were
well
received
by
captain
m
who
thanked
them
for
their
exertions
the
wounded
had
been
some
time
under
the
hands
of
macallan
and
fresh
crews
having
been
ordered
into
the
boats
they
returned
to
the
privateer
the
hatches
were
taken
off
and
the
prisoners
removed
to
the
frigate
the
name
of
the
prize
was
the
of
two
hundred
tons
burthen
mounting
fourteen
guns
and
having
on
board
at
the
commencement
of
the
attack
her
full
complement
of
one
hundred
and
men
chapter
thirty
two
many
with
trust
with
doubt
few
are
undone
lord
brook
doubt
wisely
in
strange
way
to
stand
inquiring
right
is
not
to
stray
to
run
wrong
is
donne
when
the
hatches
were
taken
off
on
board
of
the
privateer
the
prisoners
as
they
came
up
were
handed
into
the
boats
jerry
stood
at
the
hatchway
with
his
cutlass
in
his
hand
making
his
sarcastic
remarks
upon
them
as
they
appeared
a
short
interval
had
elapsed
after
it
was
supposed
that
everybody
had
come
from
below
when
a
tall
thin
personage
in
the
dress
of
a
landsman
crawled
up
the
hatchway
halloo
cried
jerry
mr
longtogs
who
have
we
here
why
he
must
be
the
i
say
mounseer
very
much
suspect
vous
what
they
call
a
father
confessor
devilish
good
idea
a
privateer
with
a
parson
what
your
pay
mounseer
a
tenth
of
course
little
enough
too
for
looking
after
the
souls
of
such
a
set
of
damned
rascals
well
mounseer
etes
without
benefit
of
clergy
so
hop
into
that
boat
why
confound
it
here
another
continued
jerry
as
a
second
made
his
appearance
he
the
clerk
of
course
as
he
follows
the
parson
come
mont
arrivo
jack
what
a
the
rascal
has
during
this
elegant
harangue
which
was
certainly
meant
for
his
own
amusement
more
than
for
their
edification
as
jerry
had
no
idea
but
that
they
were
belonging
to
the
privateer
and
of
course
could
not
comprehend
him
both
the
parties
looked
at
him
and
at
each
other
with
astonishment
until
the
first
who
had
appeared
addressed
the
latter
with
i
say
paul
did
you
ever
see
such
a
thing
before
damn
it
why
he
like
a
sixpenny
fife
more
noise
than
substance
jerry
at
once
perceived
his
mistake
and
recollected
that
the
master
of
the
vessel
which
they
had
boarded
had
mentioned
that
two
english
merchants
had
been
taken
out
of
her
by
the
privateer
with
the
hopes
of
ransom
but
nettled
with
the
remark
which
had
been
made
he
retorted
with
well
i
recommend
you
not
to
attempt
to
play
upon
me
that
all
no
i
do
mean
for
i
should
only
make
you
squeak
you
are
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
detained
by
the
privateer
i
presume
said
pearce
the
master
who
had
come
on
board
to
superintend
the
necessary
arrangements
previous
to
her
being
sent
in
we
are
sir
and
must
introduce
ourselves
my
name
is
mr
peter
capon
that
of
my
friend
designated
by
that
young
gentleman
as
is
mr
paul
contract
will
you
oblige
us
with
a
boat
to
go
on
board
of
the
frigate
that
we
may
speak
to
the
captain
most
certainly
jump
into
the
first
cutter
there
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
so
unpleasantly
situated
gentlemen
why
did
not
you
come
on
deck
before
peter
did
not
state
the
real
ground
which
was
to
secure
their
property
which
was
below
from
being
plundered
by
the
privateer
crew
but
wishing
to
pay
off
jerry
for
his
impertinence
replied
why
we
did
look
up
the
hatchway
several
times
but
there
was
something
so
awful
and
i
may
say
so
in
the
appearance
of
that
officer
with
his
drawn
sword
that
we
were
afraid
we
could
not
imagine
into
whose
hands
the
vessel
had
fallen
we
thought
it
had
been
captured
by
the
yahoos
houyhnhnms
more
likely
you
find
i
a
bit
of
a
horse
replied
jerry
in
a
passion
by
jove
then
you
only
fit
for
the
hounds
observed
the
gentleman
with
oblique
vision
i
should
order
you
would
you
well
now
i
order
you
sir
replied
the
youngster
whose
anger
made
him
quite
forget
the
presence
of
his
commanding
officer
have
the
goodness
to
step
into
that
boat
and
i
shall
order
you
mr
j
observed
the
master
with
asperity
i
order
you
to
go
into
that
boat
and
take
these
gentlemen
on
board
and
to
hold
your
tongue
ay
ay
sir
this
way
sir
said
jerry
to
mr
peter
making
him
a
polite
bow
and
pointing
to
the
boat
at
the
gangway
in
that
direction
sir
if
you
please
continued
jerry
bowing
to
mr
paul
and
pointing
to
the
quarter
of
the
vessel
and
why
in
that
direction
sir
observed
paul
i
am
going
on
board
of
the
frigate
i
know
it
sir
it
was
considerate
on
my
part
i
was
allowing
for
the
angle
of
obliquity
in
your
vision
you
would
have
exactly
fetched
the
boat
the
indignation
of
mr
paul
was
now
at
its
height
and
pearce
the
master
who
was
much
annoyed
at
jerry
excessive
impertinence
which
he
knew
captain
m
would
never
have
overlooked
detained
the
boat
for
a
minute
while
he
wrote
a
few
lines
to
price
requesting
him
to
send
the
bearer
of
it
to
the
masthead
upon
delivery
for
his
impertinent
conduct
mr
j
take
this
on
board
and
deliver
it
from
me
to
the
commanding
officer
ay
ay
sir
replied
jerry
shove
off
there
forward
mr
peter
looked
jerry
earnestly
in
his
face
for
some
time
as
they
were
pulling
on
board
well
now
damn
it
i
like
you
if
it
only
for
your
excessive
impudence
a
negative
sort
of
commendation
but
i
believe
it
the
only
one
that
he
has
replied
the
other
in
a
surly
tone
highly
flattered
sir
replied
jerry
to
mr
peter
that
you
should
perceive
anything
to
induce
you
to
like
me
but
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
return
the
compliment
for
i
really
can
not
perceive
anything
to
like
you
for
as
for
your
friend
there
i
can
only
say
that
i
detest
all
in
bow
forward
way
enough
now
gentlemen
with
your
permission
i
show
you
the
road
said
the
youngster
climbing
up
the
side
jerry
who
had
some
suspicion
that
the
note
was
not
in
his
favour
took
the
liberty
as
it
was
neither
sealed
nor
watered
of
reading
it
under
the
while
price
was
showing
the
two
gentlemen
into
the
cabin
not
to
deliver
a
note
on
service
was
an
offence
for
which
captain
m
would
have
dismissed
him
from
the
ship
but
to
be
perched
up
like
a
monkey
at
the
in
the
afternoon
after
having
fought
like
a
man
in
the
morning
was
very
much
against
the
grain
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
cared
little
about
it
he
went
upon
deck
again
where
he
found
prose
on
the
gangway
well
prose
my
boy
how
are
you
why
upon
my
soul
jerry
i
am
tired
to
death
seven
times
have
i
been
backward
and
forward
to
that
abominable
privateer
and
now
my
tea
is
ready
and
i
am
ordered
to
go
again
for
these
gentlemen
things
well
that
is
hard
i
will
go
for
you
prose
shall
i
where
the
boat
all
ready
alongside
well
now
it
very
kind
of
you
jerry
i
do
declare
jerry
laid
hold
of
the
and
began
to
descend
the
side
and
then
as
if
recollecting
himself
of
a
sudden
said
oh
by
the
bye
i
had
nearly
forgot
here
a
note
from
the
master
to
mr
price
give
it
him
prose
yes
jerry
i
will
replied
prose
walking
over
to
the
side
of
the
where
price
was
carrying
on
the
duty
while
jerry
made
all
the
haste
he
could
and
shoved
off
in
the
boat
a
note
sir
from
mr
pearce
the
master
hum
said
price
running
it
over
mr
prose
go
up
to
the
masthead
and
stay
there
till
i
call
you
down
sir
replied
prose
aghast
no
reply
sir
up
immediately
why
sir
it
was
another
word
sir
and
i
keep
you
there
all
night
cried
price
walking
forward
in
furtherance
of
the
duty
he
was
carrying
on
well
now
i
do
declare
what
have
i
done
said
prose
with
a
whimpering
voice
as
he
reluctantly
ascended
the
not
unperceived
by
jerry
who
was
watching
the
result
as
he
pulled
on
board
of
the
privateer
come
on
board
for
these
gentlemen
clothes
sir
said
jerry
reporting
himself
to
mr
pearce
who
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
him
inquired
did
mr
price
receive
my
note
yes
sir
he
did
why
i
requested
him
to
masthead
you
many
thanks
sir
for
your
kindness
replied
the
youngster
touching
his
hat
pearce
who
was
annoyed
that
his
request
should
not
have
been
complied
with
stated
his
feelings
on
the
subject
to
price
when
he
returned
to
the
ship
in
the
evening
price
declared
that
he
had
sent
prose
to
the
masthead
and
had
not
called
him
down
until
eight
the
affair
was
thus
explained
and
jerry
was
pardoned
for
the
ingenuity
of
his
de
while
all
the
comfort
that
was
received
by
the
unfortunate
prose
was
being
informed
on
the
ensuing
morning
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
the
prize
being
now
ready
captain
m
desired
courtenay
to
take
charge
of
it
and
select
two
of
the
midshipmen
to
accompany
him
his
choice
fell
upon
seymour
and
jerry
the
latter
being
selected
rather
for
his
own
amusement
than
for
his
qualities
as
an
officer
the
distance
to
jamaica
to
which
island
he
was
directed
to
proceed
and
from
thence
with
his
crew
to
obtain
a
passage
to
barbadoes
was
not
great
and
captain
m
did
not
like
to
have
the
frigate
short
manned
he
was
therefore
not
allowed
to
take
more
than
ten
seamen
with
him
five
prisoners
being
sent
on
board
to
assist
in
navigating
the
vessel
mr
capon
and
mr
contract
at
their
own
request
went
as
passengers
in
the
afternoon
as
soon
as
the
provisions
were
on
board
courtenay
received
his
written
orders
and
in
a
few
hours
the
frigate
was
out
of
sight
they
had
barely
time
to
stow
away
everything
in
its
place
and
make
the
necessary
arrangements
when
a
heavy
north
east
swell
and
lowering
horizon
predicted
a
continuance
of
the
fair
wind
and
plenty
of
it
so
it
proved
the
wind
increased
rapidly
and
the
men
found
it
difficult
to
reduce
the
canvas
in
sufficient
time
before
dark
the
wind
blew
with
considerable
force
not
steadily
but
in
fitful
gusts
and
the
sun
as
he
descended
in
the
wave
warned
them
by
his
red
and
fiery
aspect
to
prepare
for
an
increase
of
the
gale
the
schooner
flew
before
it
under
her
diminished
sail
rolling
in
the
deep
trough
or
lurching
heavily
as
her
weather
quarter
was
borne
up
aloft
by
the
culminating
swell
all
was
secured
for
the
night
the
watch
was
set
and
seymour
walked
the
deck
while
courtenay
and
the
rest
went
below
and
at
an
early
hour
retired
to
their
beds
among
other
reasons
for
selecting
our
hero
as
one
of
his
assistants
courtenay
was
influenced
by
his
perfect
knowledge
of
the
french
language
which
might
prove
useful
in
communicating
with
the
french
prisoners
who
were
sent
on
board
to
assist
in
working
the
vessel
jerry
had
also
boasted
of
his
talent
in
that
way
as
he
wished
to
go
in
the
prize
and
although
the
reader
from
the
specimen
which
he
has
had
may
not
exactly
give
credit
to
his
assertions
yet
courtenay
who
had
never
heard
him
believed
that
he
was
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
language
but
soon
after
they
had
parted
with
the
frigate
when
courtenay
desired
the
french
prisoners
to
lay
hold
of
the
ropes
and
assist
in
shortening
sail
they
all
refused
seymour
was
not
on
deck
at
the
time
he
had
been
desired
to
superintend
the
arrangements
below
and
although
he
had
been
informed
of
their
conduct
he
had
not
yet
spoken
to
the
prisoners
two
of
them
were
sitting
aft
under
the
lee
of
the
as
seymour
was
walking
the
deck
to
and
fro
they
were
in
earnest
conversation
when
seymour
stopped
near
to
them
carelessly
leaning
over
the
watching
the
long
following
seas
when
he
overheard
one
say
to
the
other
nous
replied
the
other
who
immediately
rose
and
addressed
seymour
in
french
relative
to
the
weather
what
he
had
previously
heard
induced
our
hero
to
shake
his
head
and
continue
to
look
over
the
and
as
seymour
only
answered
in
the
english
negative
to
a
further
interrogation
the
prisoners
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
remove
out
of
his
hearing
but
satisfied
with
his
not
being
able
to
comprehend
them
sat
down
again
and
resumed
their
conversation
the
lurching
of
the
vessel
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
not
walking
the
deck
but
seymour
to
remove
all
suspicion
took
another
turn
or
two
and
then
again
held
on
by
the
ropes
close
by
the
frenchmen
the
wind
blew
too
fresh
to
permit
him
to
catch
more
than
an
occasional
sentence
or
two
of
their
conversation
but
what
he
heard
made
him
more
anxious
to
collect
more
ne
sont
que
seize
avec
ce
petit
observed
one
nous
here
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
seymour
reckoned
up
the
english
on
board
and
found
that
with
billy
pitt
whom
macallan
had
allowed
courtenay
to
take
with
him
as
his
steward
they
exactly
amounted
to
that
number
the
latter
epithet
he
considered
justly
enough
to
be
bestowed
upon
his
friend
jerry
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
intercepted
they
throw
us
overboard
if
we
do
not
succeed
we
throw
them
overboard
if
we
do
mon
ami
il
aura
pas
de
difficulte
nous
sommes
trop
replied
the
other
as
terminating
their
conversation
they
rose
and
walked
forward
it
was
evident
to
our
hero
that
something
was
in
agitation
but
at
the
same
time
it
appeared
perfectly
incomprehensible
that
six
prisoners
should
have
even
formed
the
idea
of
attempting
the
recapture
of
a
vessel
manned
with
sixteen
englishmen
and
that
they
should
consider
themselves
as
to
insure
success
determined
to
report
what
he
had
heard
to
courtenay
seymour
walked
the
remainder
of
his
watch
was
relieved
and
went
below
to
his
hammock
the
wind
had
increased
during
the
night
but
as
it
was
fair
and
the
sky
clear
and
the
sun
shone
bright
the
breeze
was
rather
a
matter
of
congratulation
when
they
met
at
breakfast
in
the
morning
although
peter
and
paul
complained
of
the
violent
motion
of
the
vessel
having
taken
away
their
appetite
seymour
reported
to
courtenay
the
fragments
of
the
conversation
which
he
had
overheard
and
insane
as
appeared
to
be
the
idea
of
recapture
the
latter
agreed
with
him
that
it
demanded
caution
on
their
parts
but
as
it
would
appear
very
opposite
to
the
english
character
to
take
open
measures
against
six
prisoners
when
they
were
so
numerous
he
contented
himself
with
desiring
all
the
arms
and
ammunition
to
be
stowed
in
the
cabin
and
gave
orders
that
the
prisoners
as
they
refused
to
work
should
not
be
allowed
to
come
on
deck
after
dusk
and
then
gave
the
affair
no
further
thought
seymour
was
aware
that
although
it
was
his
duty
to
report
the
circumstance
he
had
no
right
to
press
the
matter
upon
courtenay
who
was
to
be
supposed
the
best
judge
still
he
was
not
satisfied
he
had
an
unaccountable
foreboding
that
all
was
not
right
he
turned
the
subject
in
his
mind
until
dinner
was
announced
by
billy
pitt
which
put
an
end
to
his
reverie
the
violent
jerking
motion
of
the
vessel
made
it
no
easy
task
to
retain
a
position
at
table
which
was
securely
lashed
as
for
placing
on
it
the
whole
of
the
dinner
at
once
decanters
etcetera
that
would
have
been
certain
destruction
a
plate
and
spoon
for
their
soup
was
all
which
billy
pitt
who
was
would
trust
them
with
paul
who
was
not
the
best
sailor
in
the
world
had
secured
to
himself
the
seat
to
windward
and
it
consequently
fell
to
his
lot
to
help
the
which
was
placed
at
the
of
the
table
to
save
time
and
breakage
two
important
things
in
a
they
all
held
their
own
plates
which
they
thrust
in
towards
the
tureen
from
the
different
quarters
of
the
table
to
receive
their
supply
paul
having
helped
those
nearest
to
him
rose
from
his
chair
that
he
might
see
to
fill
the
plates
on
the
other
side
of
the
tureen
he
was
leaning
over
his
centre
of
gravity
being
considerably
beyond
the
perpendicular
when
a
heavy
sea
struck
the
vessel
and
threw
her
nearly
on
her
pitching
paul
right
over
the
table
to
leeward
with
the
tureen
which
he
did
not
forget
to
take
with
him
he
flew
into
jerry
arms
and
they
rolled
together
on
the
floor
the
contents
of
the
tureen
were
rapidly
deposited
in
the
open
bosom
of
jerry
who
disengaged
himself
from
the
embraces
of
his
enemy
as
fast
as
he
could
amidst
the
laughter
of
his
companions
well
you
asked
for
soup
observed
courtenay
yes
and
my
friend
has
helped
me
very
liberally
replied
jerry
who
was
not
at
all
out
of
humour
except
when
he
was
foiled
with
his
own
weapons
in
the
meantime
paul
who
was
a
little
stunned
with
the
blow
he
had
received
on
his
head
had
continued
on
the
floor
rolling
in
the
and
was
just
attempting
to
get
on
his
legs
you
got
it
all
to
yourself
there
mr
paul
as
you
seem
to
like
it
perhaps
you
would
prefer
a
spoon
said
jerry
offering
him
one
at
the
same
time
i
say
paul
what
a
capital
harlequin
you
would
make
observed
peter
paul
who
had
recovered
his
legs
and
now
clung
on
by
the
table
looked
an
answer
horribly
asquint
as
if
he
did
not
admire
the
joke
but
he
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
was
brought
down
without
further
accident
occurring
and
by
the
time
it
was
over
as
the
bottle
had
to
be
passed
round
and
everybody
was
obliged
to
drink
off
immediately
and
put
his
inside
his
waistcoat
to
save
it
from
perdition
they
all
were
very
merry
and
happy
before
the
repast
had
been
concluded
there
said
jerry
stroking
himself
down
when
he
had
finished
his
cheese
as
if
he
were
a
falstaff
a
kitten
might
play
with
me
now
more
than
one
dare
do
with
me
rejoined
peter
for
i
cursedly
inclined
to
the
but
as
the
second
evening
closed
in
the
sky
was
loaded
with
heavy
clouds
the
scud
flew
wildly
past
them
the
sea
increased
to
mountains
high
and
the
gale
roared
through
the
rigging
of
the
schooner
which
was
now
impelled
before
it
under
bare
poles
they
were
really
in
danger
the
hatches
were
battened
down
fore
and
aft
the
ports
were
knocked
out
to
allow
the
escape
of
the
water
which
poured
over
in
such
volumes
as
would
otherwise
have
swamped
the
vessel
and
courtenay
and
his
crew
remained
on
deck
until
dawn
of
day
when
the
violence
of
the
gale
seemed
to
have
abated
courtenay
desired
seymour
and
jerry
to
turn
in
and
relieve
him
at
eight
our
hero
and
jerry
went
down
into
the
cabin
where
they
found
the
two
passengers
who
although
they
had
not
come
on
deck
during
the
night
had
not
retired
to
bed
peter
was
sitting
up
to
windward
on
the
locker
looking
very
pale
and
very
paul
was
on
the
with
one
hand
holding
on
by
the
leg
of
the
table
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
in
the
other
his
he
had
abandoned
during
a
fright
and
it
was
washing
about
in
the
jerry
was
delighted
but
put
on
a
rueful
face
well
observed
paul
who
was
nearly
frightened
out
of
his
wits
how
is
it
now
worse
and
worse
replied
jerry
there
nine
inches
water
in
the
well
oh
my
god
cried
paul
who
was
not
very
at
nautical
technicalities
raising
one
eye
up
to
heaven
while
the
other
appeared
to
rest
upon
the
bottle
of
brandy
but
why
do
you
turn
in
said
jerry
we
can
go
to
the
bottom
just
as
comfortably
in
bed
as
anywhere
else
i
agree
with
you
replied
peter
who
had
often
been
at
sea
and
knew
very
well
that
all
was
right
by
the
two
midshipmen
coming
off
deck
my
mother
prophesied
that
i
never
should
die
in
my
bed
but
determined
that
i
will
you
had
better
turn
in
mr
paul
said
seymour
kindly
i
ring
for
the
steward
billy
pitt
made
his
appearance
by
gad
gentlemen
the
damned
schooner
under
water
under
water
cried
paul
with
dismay
the
bottle
was
applied
to
his
mouth
as
if
he
was
determined
to
leave
as
little
room
as
possible
for
the
element
which
he
expected
instantaneously
to
be
struggling
in
with
the
assistance
of
billy
paul
was
placed
in
one
of
the
standing
at
the
side
of
the
cabin
jerry
put
his
at
the
side
of
his
pillow
kindly
informing
him
that
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
taking
a
few
more
swigs
before
he
went
down
for
the
water
was
only
up
to
her
bends
at
present
peter
was
already
in
the
cot
next
to
him
and
seymour
and
jerry
turned
in
without
taking
off
their
clothes
in
courtenay
bed
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
before
they
had
fallen
asleep
they
heard
paul
cry
out
peter
peter
well
what
do
you
want
do
you
think
there
are
any
hopes
peter
who
wished
to
frighten
his
companion
replied
gravely
i
am
afraid
not
but
paul
i
just
been
reflecting
upon
the
subject
here
we
are
two
men
considerably
on
the
wrong
side
of
forty
we
have
enjoyed
our
youth
which
is
the
happiest
period
of
our
life
we
are
now
fast
descending
the
hill
to
old
age
decrepitude
and
disease
what
avails
a
few
more
years
allowing
that
we
are
spared
this
time
you
perceive
the
of
my
observations
paul
groaned
and
made
no
answer
but
even
the
creaking
of
the
timbers
could
not
disguise
the
repeated
as
the
brandy
from
the
bottle
gurgled
down
his
throat
chapter
thirty
three
two
striplings
lads
more
like
to
run
than
to
commit
such
slaughter
cymbeline
the
gales
of
wind
in
the
tropical
climates
are
violent
while
they
last
but
are
seldom
of
long
duration
such
was
the
case
in
the
present
instance
for
it
subsided
in
a
few
hours
after
daylight
and
the
schooner
that
had
been
propelled
before
it
was
now
sheltered
under
the
lee
of
the
island
of
domingo
and
with
all
her
canvas
spread
was
gliding
through
a
tranquil
sea
again
they
were
collected
round
the
to
a
more
quiet
repast
than
they
had
hitherto
enjoyed
since
they
had
come
on
board
paul
had
not
quite
recovered
his
spirits
although
when
he
went
on
deck
just
before
the
dinner
was
announced
he
was
delighted
at
the
sudden
change
which
had
taken
place
but
the
mirth
of
his
companions
at
his
expense
was
not
received
in
very
good
part
after
dinner
finding
himself
in
a
better
humour
he
turned
to
peter
and
addressed
him
i
say
peter
i
made
no
answer
to
your
remarks
last
night
when
we
expected
to
go
down
but
i
have
since
had
time
deliberately
to
weigh
your
arguments
and
i
should
like
you
to
explain
to
me
where
the
was
that
you
so
strenuously
pointed
out
for
hang
me
if
i
can
discover
it
seymour
again
had
charge
of
the
first
watch
and
notwithstanding
that
the
orders
for
the
prisoners
to
remain
below
after
dark
had
been
communicated
to
them
he
observed
that
on
one
pretence
or
other
they
occasionally
came
on
deck
and
repeatedly
put
their
heads
above
the
hatchway
this
conduct
reminded
him
of
the
conversation
which
he
had
overheard
and
again
it
was
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
captain
m
had
one
day
observed
to
him
that
if
there
was
no
duty
going
on
he
could
not
employ
himself
in
a
more
useful
manner
when
he
was
walking
the
deck
than
by
placing
himself
or
the
ship
in
difficult
situations
and
reflecting
upon
the
most
eligible
means
of
relief
depend
upon
it
observed
captain
m
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
find
it
of
use
to
you
and
it
will
create
for
you
a
presence
of
mind
in
a
sudden
dilemma
which
may
be
the
salvation
of
yourself
and
the
ship
you
are
in
seymour
remembering
this
injunction
reflected
upon
what
would
be
the
most
advisable
steps
to
take
in
case
of
the
french
prisoners
attempting
to
recapture
during
his
watch
on
deck
that
there
were
but
six
it
was
very
true
but
at
the
same
time
during
the
night
watches
there
were
but
five
english
seamen
and
the
officer
of
the
watch
on
deck
should
the
frenchmen
have
the
boldness
to
attempt
to
regain
possession
of
the
vessel
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
the
watch
could
be
surprised
the
hatches
would
be
secured
over
those
below
what
should
be
the
steps
in
such
a
case
that
he
ought
to
take
such
were
the
cogitations
of
seymour
when
midnight
was
reported
and
jerry
was
summoned
to
relieve
the
deck
which
he
did
not
do
relying
upon
our
hero
until
past
one
bell
up
he
came
with
his
ready
apology
i
really
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
fellow
but
i
had
not
a
wink
of
sleep
last
night
never
mind
jerry
i
am
not
at
all
sleepy
i
had
been
thinking
about
these
french
prisoners
i
can
not
get
their
conversation
out
of
my
head
why
i
did
not
like
it
myself
when
i
heard
of
it
replied
jerry
i
hope
they
wo
attempt
it
in
my
watch
it
would
not
give
them
much
trouble
to
launch
me
over
the
quarter
i
should
skim
away
light
like
a
lady
bonnet
what
would
you
do
jerry
if
you
perceived
them
rushing
aft
to
retake
the
vessel
inquired
seymour
who
was
aware
of
his
ready
invention
skim
up
the
rigging
like
a
lamplighter
to
be
sure
not
that
it
would
be
of
much
use
if
they
gained
the
day
except
say
a
few
prayers
before
i
went
astern
well
that
was
my
idea
but
i
thought
that
if
one
had
a
musket
and
ammunition
up
there
a
diversion
might
created
in
favour
of
those
below
for
the
prisoners
have
no
firearms
very
true
replied
jerry
we
might
puzzle
them
not
a
little
now
jerry
suppose
we
were
to
take
that
precaution
for
i
do
not
like
their
manoeuvres
during
my
watch
it
will
do
harm
if
it
does
no
good
suppose
you
fetch
two
muskets
and
from
the
cabin
take
one
and
secure
it
in
the
and
you
do
the
same
at
the
main
for
courtenay
is
too
proud
to
keep
an
armed
watch
jerry
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
brought
up
the
muskets
and
ammunition
seymour
gave
him
a
stout
to
lash
the
musket
and
taking
another
himself
they
both
ascended
the
rigging
at
the
same
time
and
were
busy
securing
the
muskets
up
and
down
at
the
head
of
the
lower
masts
when
they
heard
a
sudden
rush
upon
deck
beneath
them
it
was
dark
though
not
so
dark
but
they
could
distinguish
what
was
going
on
and
they
perceived
that
their
thoughts
had
but
anticipated
the
reality
the
french
are
up
roared
the
man
at
the
wheel
to
rouse
those
below
as
well
as
the
watch
who
were
lying
about
the
decks
but
to
the
astonishment
of
the
youngsters
aloft
as
well
as
of
the
men
on
deck
not
six
but
about
twenty
frenchmen
armed
with
cutlasses
made
their
appearance
the
hatches
were
over
and
secured
in
a
minute
and
the
unarmed
english
on
deck
were
then
attacked
by
the
superior
force
it
was
with
agonised
feelings
that
seymour
and
jerry
heard
the
scuffle
which
took
place
it
was
short
and
plunge
after
plunge
into
the
water
alongside
announced
the
death
of
each
separate
victim
the
man
at
the
wheel
struggled
long
he
was
of
an
athletic
frame
but
overpowered
by
numbers
he
was
launched
over
the
taffrail
the
french
supposing
that
the
remainder
of
the
crew
were
below
placed
sentries
over
the
hatches
that
they
might
not
be
forced
and
then
collected
together
abaft
altering
the
course
of
the
vessel
for
domingo
it
will
be
necessary
to
explain
the
sudden
appearance
of
so
many
frenchmen
when
the
captain
of
the
privateer
was
occupied
during
the
night
previous
to
the
attack
with
his
several
plans
of
defence
he
also
arranged
one
for
the
recapture
of
the
vessel
in
case
of
their
being
overpowered
with
this
in
view
he
had
constructed
a
platform
in
the
hold
on
which
a
tier
of
casks
was
stowed
and
under
which
there
was
sufficient
space
for
fifteen
or
twenty
men
to
lie
concealed
when
the
privateer
men
had
been
driven
below
and
the
hatches
secured
over
them
fifteen
armed
with
cutlasses
concealed
themselves
in
this
place
with
the
the
hopes
of
recapturing
the
vessel
from
the
after
she
should
have
parted
company
with
the
frigate
the
prisoners
who
had
been
sent
on
board
to
assist
in
navigating
the
schooner
to
jamaica
had
communicated
with
them
unperceived
after
dark
as
all
the
english
were
fatigued
from
having
been
on
deck
during
the
previous
night
the
middle
watch
was
proposed
for
the
attempt
which
had
thus
far
been
attended
with
success
seymour
and
jerry
remained
quiet
at
the
mastheads
for
although
they
did
not
attempt
to
communicate
with
each
other
for
fear
of
discovery
they
both
rightly
judged
that
it
would
be
best
to
remain
till
daylight
by
which
time
some
plans
would
have
been
formed
by
the
party
below
which
their
situation
would
enable
them
materially
to
assist
nearly
four
hours
elapsed
previous
to
the
dawning
of
the
day
during
which
interval
jerry
had
ample
time
to
say
some
of
those
prayers
which
he
spoke
of
and
which
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
they
both
did
not
fail
to
offer
up
in
their
perilous
situation
as
soon
as
the
day
began
to
break
jerry
who
had
not
yet
loaded
his
musket
lest
he
might
be
heard
thought
it
time
to
prepare
for
action
he
primed
and
put
in
his
cartridge
in
the
ramming
down
of
which
a
slight
ringing
of
the
ramrod
against
the
muzzle
attracted
the
notice
of
one
of
the
frenchmen
who
looking
up
after
a
short
time
exclaimed
monsieur
misere
qui
est
jerry
levelled
with
a
steady
aim
and
the
bullet
passed
through
the
broad
chest
of
the
frenchman
who
rolled
upon
the
deck
now
they
may
chant
your
cried
the
youngster
a
second
shot
from
the
laid
another
frenchman
alongside
of
his
companion
diable
nous
serons
abimes
par
ces
enfans
la
il
faut
the
muskets
were
again
loaded
and
again
each
boy
brought
down
his
bird
before
the
frenchmen
could
decide
upon
their
operations
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
that
the
youngsters
should
be
attacked
but
it
was
a
service
of
no
little
danger
and
of
certain
destruction
to
one
who
must
fall
a
sacrifice
that
the
other
might
be
able
to
secure
the
youngster
before
he
had
time
to
reload
his
musket
two
of
the
most
daring
flew
to
the
one
ascending
to
windward
and
the
other
to
seymour
who
perceived
their
intentions
reserved
his
fire
until
he
saw
the
one
in
the
weather
rigging
fall
by
jerry
musket
he
then
levelled
at
the
one
to
leeward
who
dropped
into
the
and
from
thence
into
the
sea
thus
had
six
frenchmen
already
fallen
by
the
coolness
and
determination
of
two
boys
one
but
fourteen
and
the
other
not
sixteen
years
old
a
short
consultation
ended
in
the
frenchmen
resorting
to
the
only
measures
likely
to
be
attended
with
success
leaving
three
to
guard
the
hatchways
the
remaining
twelve
divided
into
four
parties
began
to
mount
both
fore
and
to
windward
and
to
leeward
at
the
same
time
the
fate
of
jerry
and
seymour
now
appeared
to
be
decided
they
might
each
kill
one
man
more
and
then
would
have
been
hurled
into
the
sea
but
during
the
consultation
seymour
who
anticipated
this
movement
and
had
a
knife
in
his
pocket
divided
the
lanyards
of
the
lee
topmast
rigging
and
running
up
the
weather
side
with
his
musket
and
ammunition
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
the
topmast
hauled
up
the
lee
rigging
after
him
thus
gaining
a
position
that
would
admit
but
one
person
mounting
up
to
him
at
a
time
he
called
to
jerry
pointing
out
what
he
had
done
that
he
might
do
the
same
but
unfortunately
jerry
had
not
a
knife
and
could
not
he
contented
himself
with
climbing
up
to
the
topmast
to
which
he
was
followed
by
two
of
the
frenchmen
jerry
levelled
his
musket
and
passed
his
bullet
through
the
skull
of
one
of
his
pursuers
whose
heavy
fall
on
the
deck
shook
the
schooner
fore
and
aft
and
then
aware
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
pitched
his
musket
overboard
that
they
might
not
gain
possession
of
it
and
climbing
with
a
nimbleness
suited
to
the
occasion
up
to
the
masthead
descended
by
the
stay
to
the
and
joined
seymour
in
the
presence
of
the
exasperated
frenchmen
who
now
unable
to
reach
either
of
them
were
at
a
nonplus
i
say
monsieur
no
catchee
no
habbee
cried
jerry
laughing
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
side
from
loss
of
breath
but
we
must
now
acquaint
the
reader
with
what
is
going
on
below
the
surprise
of
courtenay
when
he
found
the
hatches
down
and
the
deck
in
possession
of
the
french
was
removed
when
the
men
who
had
been
secured
with
him
stated
that
as
they
lay
in
their
hammocks
they
had
been
awakened
by
a
large
body
of
men
running
up
the
hatchway
he
now
perceived
that
there
must
have
been
men
concealed
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel
the
struggle
on
deck
the
splashing
in
the
water
all
had
been
plainly
heard
below
they
were
aware
of
the
fate
of
their
shipmates
and
did
not
expect
to
see
daylight
again
until
they
were
handed
up
as
prisoners
in
a
french
port
the
feelings
of
courtenay
were
not
enviable
he
upbraided
himself
for
having
by
his
want
of
prudence
lost
the
vessel
and
sacrificed
the
lives
of
the
two
midshipmen
and
five
seamen
who
had
the
watch
on
deck
the
party
below
consisted
of
courtenay
peter
and
paul
billy
pitt
and
five
seamen
and
a
consultation
was
held
as
to
their
proceedings
to
regain
the
vessel
and
avenge
the
death
of
their
shipmates
or
to
perish
in
the
attempt
was
the
determination
of
the
lieutenant
he
was
aware
that
the
french
had
no
firearms
and
amply
supplied
as
they
were
he
would
have
cared
little
for
their
numbers
if
once
on
deck
but
how
to
get
on
deck
was
the
problem
to
set
fire
to
the
vessel
and
rush
up
in
the
flames
to
scuttle
her
or
to
blow
her
up
and
all
go
down
together
were
each
proposed
and
agitated
peter
plan
was
considered
as
the
most
feasible
he
suggested
that
one
half
of
the
cabin
table
which
was
divided
in
two
should
be
placed
upon
the
other
so
as
to
raise
it
up
to
the
coamings
of
the
on
the
upper
table
to
place
a
pound
or
two
of
powder
which
from
the
ascending
principle
of
explosion
would
blow
off
the
skylight
and
grating
without
injuring
the
vessel
below
then
with
their
muskets
loaded
and
bayonets
fixed
to
jump
on
the
table
and
from
thence
if
possible
gain
the
deck
this
was
agreed
to
and
the
preparations
were
well
forward
when
the
report
of
jerry
musket
was
heard
another
succeeded
and
they
were
perplexed
had
the
frenchmen
firearms
and
if
so
what
could
they
be
firing
at
the
falling
of
the
bodies
on
deck
and
the
indistinct
curses
of
the
frenchmen
puzzled
them
even
more
what
can
it
be
observed
courtenay
i
recollect
now
said
paul
as
i
lay
awake
i
saw
young
pass
my
bed
with
a
musket
i
wondered
what
it
was
for
then
probably
he
has
gained
the
rigging
with
it
and
is
safe
cried
courtenay
intuitively
be
quick
where
the
powder
take
that
candle
further
off
the
train
was
laid
as
the
muskets
continued
to
be
discharged
they
removed
from
the
cabin
it
was
fired
and
the
skylight
was
blown
up
killing
the
frenchman
who
guarded
the
hatchway
at
the
very
moment
that
the
frenchmen
were
in
the
rigging
puzzled
with
the
manoeuvres
of
seymour
and
the
escape
of
jerry
courtenay
and
his
party
rushed
into
the
cabin
mounted
the
table
and
were
on
deck
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
and
the
frenchmen
who
had
not
had
time
to
descend
the
rigging
were
at
their
mercy
mercy
they
were
not
entitled
to
they
had
shown
none
to
the
unarmed
english
whom
they
had
wantonly
thrown
into
the
sea
when
they
had
overpowered
them
and
were
now
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
the
two
boys
no
mercy
was
shown
to
them
as
they
dropped
one
by
one
from
the
rigging
wounded
or
dead
they
were
tossed
into
the
wave
as
an
expiatory
sacrifice
to
the
manes
of
the
murdered
englishmen
in
a
few
minutes
the
carnage
was
over
seymour
and
jerry
descended
from
their
little
aloft
and
were
warmly
greeted
by
their
friends
as
they
reached
the
deck
really
mr
paul
said
jerry
shaking
his
proffered
hand
this
is
quite
an
unexpected
pleasure
well
i
never
thought
that
i
could
possibly
like
you
answered
the
other
well
observed
jerry
it
has
quite
stopped
my
growth
but
not
your
tongue
i
hope
replied
peter
that
would
be
a
pity
now
explain
to
us
how
it
all
happened
jerry
entered
into
the
detail
with
his
accustomed
humour
while
courtenay
walked
aft
with
seymour
to
have
a
more
sober
narrative
of
the
transactions
which
we
have
described
and
which
afforded
ample
matter
for
conversation
until
the
prize
was
brought
to
an
anchor
in
port
royal
harbour
where
courtenay
and
his
crew
were
ordered
a
passage
to
barbadoes
in
a
frigate
that
had
orders
to
proceed
there
in
a
few
days
and
mr
peter
capon
and
mr
paul
contract
went
on
shore
declaring
that
until
a
mail
coach
ran
between
there
and
england
they
would
never
leave
the
island
and
again
subject
themselves
to
the
charming
vicissitudes
of
a
seafaring
existence

of
the
sailed
for
barbadoes
in
the
frigate
which
had
been
ordered
to
receive
them
for
a
passage
the
frigate
was
commanded
by
one
of
the
most
singular
characters
in
the
service
he
was
a
clever
man
a
thorough
sailor
and
well
acquainted
with
the
details
and
technicalities
of
the
profession
a
spirited
and
enterprising
officer
but
of
the
most
arbitrary
disposition
so
well
was
he
acquainted
with
the
regulations
of
the
service
that
he
could
hedge
himself
in
so
as
to
insure
a
compliance
with
the
most
preposterous
orders
or
draw
the
officer
who
resisted
into
a
premunire
which
would
risk
his
commission
in
a
profession
where
one
man
is
embarked
with
many
isolated
from
the
power
whence
he
derives
his
own
where
his
fiat
must
be
received
without
a
murmur
by
hundreds
who
can
reason
as
well
as
himself
it
is
absolutely
requisite
that
he
should
be
invested
with
an
authority
amounting
to
despotism
true
it
is
that
he
is
held
responsible
to
his
superiors
for
any
undue
exercise
of
this
authority
but
amongst
so
many
to
whom
it
is
confided
there
must
be
some
who
from
disposition
or
the
bad
example
of
those
under
whom
they
have
served
will
not
adhere
to
the
limits
which
have
been
prescribed
this
however
is
no
reason
for
reducing
that
authority
which
as
you
govern
wholly
by
opinion
is
necessary
for
the
discipline
which
upholds
the
service
but
it
is
a
strong
reason
for
not
delegating
it
to
those
who
are
not
fit
to
be
intrusted
captain
bradshaw
had
many
redeeming
qualities
oppressor
as
he
was
he
admired
a
spirit
of
resistance
in
an
officer
when
it
was
shown
in
a
just
cause
and
upon
reflection
was
invariably
his
friend
for
he
felt
that
his
own
natural
temperament
was
increased
by
abject
obedience
raynal
i
think
it
is
has
said
that
the
pride
of
men
in
office
arises
as
much
from
the
servility
of
their
inferiors
or
expectants
as
from
any
other
cause
in
our
service
they
are
all
inferiors
and
all
expectants
can
it
then
be
surprising
that
a
captain
occasionally
becomes
tyrannical
but
captain
bradshaw
was
not
naturally
tyrannical
he
had
become
so
because
promoted
at
an
early
age
he
had
never
been
afterwards
opposed
no
one
contradicted
him
every
one
applauded
his
jokes
and
magnified
his
mirth
into
wit
he
would
try
by
a
an
officer
who
had
committed
a
slight
error
and
on
the
same
day
would
open
his
purse
and
extend
his
patronage
to
another
whom
he
knew
not
but
had
been
informed
that
he
was
deserving
and
had
no
friends
to
his
seamen
he
was
as
lavish
with
his
money
as
he
was
with
the
cat
he
would
give
a
man
a
new
jacket
one
day
and
cut
it
to
pieces
on
his
back
with
a
rope
end
on
the
next
yet
it
was
not
exactly
inconsistency
it
was
an
eccentricity
of
character
not
natural
but
created
by
the
service
the
graft
was
of
a
worse
quality
than
the
parent
stock
and
the
fruit
was
a
compound
of
the
two
the
sailors
who
are
of
the
most
forgiving
temper
in
the
world
and
will
pardon
a
hundred
faults
for
one
redeeming
quality
declared
that
he
war
a
bad
captain
after
all
his
violent
and
tyrannical
disposition
made
him
constantly
at
variance
with
his
officers
and
continual
changes
took
place
in
his
ship
but
it
was
observed
that
those
who
had
left
him
from
a
spirited
resistance
were
kindly
received
and
benefited
by
his
patronage
while
those
who
submitted
were
neglected
like
a
pretty
but
clever
woman
who
is
aware
that
flattery
is
to
be
despised
and
yet
from
habit
can
not
exist
without
it
so
captain
bradshaw
exacted
the
servility
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
yet
rewarded
not
those
by
whom
it
was
administered
all
the
midshipmen
promoted
on
the
station
had
to
pass
through
the
ordeal
of
sailing
with
captain
bradshaw
who
generally
had
a
vacancy
and
it
certainly
had
a
good
effect
upon
those
young
men
who
were
inclined
to
presume
upon
their
newly
acquired
rank
for
they
were
well
schooled
before
they
quitted
his
ship
when
courtenay
and
his
party
went
on
board
of
the
frigate
the
master
and
surgeon
indignant
at
language
which
had
been
used
to
them
by
the
captain
refused
to
dine
in
the
cabin
when
they
were
invited
by
the
steward
who
reported
to
captain
bradshaw
that
the
officers
would
not
accept
his
invitation
wo
they
by
god
i
see
to
that
send
my
clerk
here
the
clerk
made
his
appearance
with
an
abject
bow
mr
powell
sit
down
and
write
as
i
dictate
said
captain
bradshaw
who
walking
up
and
down
the
composed
a
memorandum
in
which
after
a
long
preamble
the
master
and
surgeon
were
directed
to
dine
with
him
every
day
until
further
orders
captain
bradshaw
having
signed
it
sent
for
the
and
delivered
it
himself
into
his
hands
ferguson
bradly
cried
the
entering
the
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
here
something
for
all
three
of
us
a
positive
order
to
dine
with
the
skipper
every
day
until
he
gets
tired
of
our
company
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
replied
the
surgeon
i
put
myself
in
the
and
if
i
am
obliged
to
go
i
not
touch
anything
rejoined
the
master
there
an
old
proverb
may
lead
a
horse
to
the
pond
but
you
ca
make
him
drink
whatever
we
do
replied
roberts
the
we
must
act
in
concert
but
i
have
been
long
enough
in
the
service
to
know
that
we
must
obey
first
and
remonstrate
afterwards
that
this
is
an
unusual
order
i
grant
nor
do
i
know
by
what
regulations
of
the
service
it
can
be
enforced
but
at
the
same
time
i
consider
that
we
run
a
great
risk
in
refusing
to
obey
it
only
observe
in
the
preamble
how
artfully
he
inserts
of
a
conspiracy
tending
to
bring
him
into
contempt
and
again
the
better
discipline
of
his
service
which
must
invariably
suffer
when
there
is
an
appearance
of
want
of
cordiality
between
those
to
whom
the
men
must
look
for
example
upon
my
soul
he
devilish
clever
i
do
believe
he
find
out
a
reason
for
drawing
out
all
our
double
teeth
if
he
was
inclined
and
prove
it
was
all
for
the
benefit
of
his
majesty
service
well
now
what
to
be
done
why
what
your
opinion
roberts
oh
mine
is
to
go
and
if
you
will
act
with
me
he
wo
allow
us
to
dine
with
him
a
second
time
well
then
i
agree
replied
the
surgeon
and
so
must
i
then
i
presume
but
by
heavens
downright
tyranny
and
oppression
never
mind
listen
to
me
let
all
go
and
all
behave
as
ill
as
we
can
be
as
unmannerly
as
bears
abuse
everything
be
as
familiar
as
possible
and
laugh
in
his
face
he
can
not
touch
us
for
it
if
we
do
not
go
too
far
and
he
not
trouble
us
to
come
a
second
time
their
plans
were
arranged
and
at
three
they
were
ushered
into
the
cabin
with
one
of
the
midshipmen
of
the
ship
and
jerry
who
as
a
stranger
had
been
honoured
with
an
invitation
captain
bradshaw
whose
property
was
equal
to
his
liberality
piqued
himself
upon
keeping
a
good
table
his
cook
was
an
and
his
wines
were
of
the
very
best
quality
after
all
there
was
no
great
hardship
in
dining
with
him
but
upon
compulsion
no
the
officers
bowed
the
captain
satisfied
with
their
obedience
intended
although
he
had
brought
them
there
by
force
to
do
the
honours
of
his
table
with
the
greatest
urbanity
roberts
said
he
do
me
the
favour
to
take
the
foot
of
the
doctor
here
a
chair
for
mr
bradly
come
round
on
this
side
now
then
steward
off
covers
and
let
us
see
what
you
have
for
us
why
youngster
does
your
captain
starve
you
no
sir
replied
jerry
who
knew
what
was
going
on
but
he
do
give
me
a
dinner
every
day
humph
muttered
the
captain
who
thought
mr
jerry
very
free
upon
so
short
an
acquaintance
the
soup
was
handed
round
the
first
spoonful
that
roberts
took
in
his
mouth
he
threw
out
on
the
deck
crying
out
as
soon
as
his
mouth
was
empty
o
lord
why
what
the
matter
inquired
the
captain
so
cursed
hot
i
burnt
my
tongue
oh
that
all
steward
wipe
up
that
mess
said
the
captain
who
was
rather
nice
in
his
eating
do
you
know
jemmy
cavan
sir
at
barbadoes
inquired
the
doctor
no
sir
i
know
no
jemmies
replied
captain
bradshaw
surprised
at
his
familiar
address
he
a
devilish
good
fellow
sir
i
can
tell
you
when
he
gets
you
on
shore
he
make
you
dine
with
him
every
day
whether
or
not
take
no
denial
now
that
what
i
call
a
damned
good
fellow
you
do
often
meet
a
chap
like
him
observed
the
master
captain
bradshaw
felt
that
he
was
indirectly
called
a
which
did
not
please
him
mr
bradly
will
you
take
some
mutton
if
you
please
said
the
master
roberts
i
trouble
you
to
carve
the
saddle
of
mutton
the
cut
out
a
slice
and
taking
it
on
the
fork
looked
at
it
suspiciously
and
then
held
his
nose
over
it
why
what
the
matter
rather
high
sir
i
afraid
oh
i
smell
it
here
said
jerry
who
entered
into
the
joke
indeed
steward
remove
that
dish
fortunately
it
is
not
all
our
dinner
what
will
you
take
mr
bradly
why
really
i
seldom
touch
anything
but
the
joint
i
hate
your
kickshaws
there
so
much
pawing
about
them
i
wait
if
you
please
in
the
meantime
i
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
you
captain
bradshaw
the
devil
you
will
was
nearly
out
of
the
captain
mouth
at
this
reversal
of
the
order
of
things
but
he
swallowed
it
down
and
answered
in
a
surly
tone
with
great
pleasure
sir
come
doctor
let
you
and
i
hob
and
nob
said
the
they
did
so
and
clicked
their
glasses
together
with
such
force
as
to
break
them
both
and
spill
the
wine
upon
the
fine
damask
jerry
could
contain
himself
no
longer
but
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
laughter
to
the
astonishment
of
captain
bradshaw
who
never
had
seen
a
midshipman
thus
conduct
himself
at
his
table
before
but
jerry
could
not
restrain
his
inclination
for
joining
with
the
party
although
he
had
no
excuse
for
behaviour
bring
some
steward
and
you
excuse
me
gentlemen
but
i
will
thank
you
not
to
try
the
strength
of
them
again
said
captain
bradshaw
with
a
very
majestic
air
now
mr
ferguson
i
shall
be
happy
to
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
you
what
will
you
have
there
sherry
and
moselle
i
prefer
champagne
if
you
please
answered
the
surgeon
who
knew
that
captain
bradshaw
did
not
produce
it
except
when
strangers
were
at
the
table
captain
bradshaw
restrained
his
indignation
and
ordered
champagne
to
be
brought
i
join
you
cried
the
shoving
in
his
glass
come
younker
let
you
and
i
have
a
glass
cosy
together
said
jerry
to
the
midshipman
who
frightened
at
what
was
going
on
moved
his
chair
a
little
further
from
jerry
and
then
looked
first
at
him
and
then
at
the
captain
oh
pray
take
a
glass
with
the
young
gentleman
said
captain
bradshaw
with
mock
politeness
come
steward
none
of
your
half
allowance
if
you
please
continued
the
impertinent
jerry
now
then
my
cock
here
you
and
luck
still
captain
bradshaw
was
astonished
i
say
youngster
did
captain
m
ever
flog
you
no
sir
replied
jerry
demurely
perceiving
that
he
had
gone
too
far
he
always
treats
his
officers
like
gentlemen
then
i
presume
sir
when
they
are
on
board
of
his
ship
that
they
conduct
themselves
as
gentlemen
this
hint
made
jerry
dumb
for
some
time
the
officers
however
continued
as
before
the
surgeon
dropped
his
plate
full
of
damascene
tart
on
the
deck
the
spilt
his
snuff
on
the
and
laid
his
on
the
table
which
he
knew
to
be
the
captain
aversion
and
the
master
requested
a
glass
of
grog
as
the
rotgut
french
wines
had
given
him
a
pain
in
the
bowels
captain
bradshaw
could
hardly
retain
his
seat
upon
the
chair
upon
which
he
fidgeted
right
and
left
he
perceived
that
his
officers
were
behaving
in
a
very
unusual
manner
and
that
it
was
with
a
view
to
his
annoyance
yet
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
take
notice
of
breaking
glasses
and
finding
fault
with
the
cookery
which
they
took
care
to
do
sending
their
plates
away
before
they
had
eaten
a
mouthful
with
apparent
disgust
neither
could
he
demand
a
for
awkwardness
or
want
of
good
manners
at
his
own
table
he
began
to
think
that
he
had
better
have
left
out
the
day
until
further
in
the
memorandum
as
rescinding
it
immediately
would
have
been
an
acknowledgment
of
their
having
gained
the
victory
and
as
to
their
going
on
in
this
way
to
put
up
with
it
was
impossible
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
dessert
placed
on
the
table
captain
bradshaw
passed
the
bottles
round
helping
himself
to
madeira
roberts
took
claret
and
as
soon
as
he
had
tasted
it
i
beg
your
pardon
captain
bradshaw
said
he
but
this
wine
is
corked
indeed
take
it
away
steward
and
bring
another
bottle
another
was
put
on
the
table
i
hope
you
will
find
that
better
mr
roberts
said
the
captain
who
really
thought
that
what
he
stated
had
been
the
case
yes
replied
the
for
the
description
of
wine
well
enough
what
do
you
mean
sir
why
its
chateau
margaux
of
the
first
growth
excuse
me
sir
replied
the
officer
with
an
incredulous
smile
they
must
have
imposed
upon
you
captain
bradshaw
who
was
an
excellent
judge
of
wine
called
for
a
glass
and
pouring
out
the
claret
tasted
it
i
must
differ
from
you
sir
and
moreover
i
have
no
better
then
i
trouble
you
to
pass
the
port
doctor
for
i
really
can
not
drink
that
stuff
do
you
drink
port
mr
bradly
said
the
captain
with
a
countenance
as
black
as
a
no
not
i
am
not
well
in
my
inside
but
i
punish
the
port
so
will
i
said
the
surgeon
and
as
i
am
not
among
the
privileged
added
jerry
who
had
already
forgotten
the
hint
i
take
my
whack
perhaps
you
may
observed
the
captain
drily
the
officers
now
began
to
be
very
noisy
arguing
among
themselves
upon
points
of
service
and
taking
no
notice
whatever
of
the
captain
the
master
in
explanation
drew
a
chart
with
wine
upon
the
polished
table
while
the
defended
his
opinion
with
pieces
of
biscuit
laid
at
different
positions
during
which
two
more
glasses
were
demolished
the
captain
rang
and
ordered
coffee
in
an
angry
tone
when
the
officers
had
taken
it
he
bowed
stiffly
and
wished
them
good
evening
there
was
one
dish
which
was
an
object
of
abhorrence
to
captain
bradshaw
the
aware
of
it
as
they
rose
to
depart
said
captain
bradshaw
if
it
not
too
great
a
liberty
we
should
like
to
have
some
we
are
all
three
very
partial
to
it
so
am
i
rejoined
jerry
captain
bradshaw
could
hold
out
no
longer
leave
the
cabin
immediately
gentlemen
by
heavens
you
shall
never
put
your
legs
under
my
table
again
are
we
not
to
dine
here
sir
replied
the
with
affected
surprise
the
order
says
day
till
further
orders
roared
the
captain
and
now
you
have
them
for
i
be
damned
if
ever
you
dine
with
me
again
the
officers
took
their
departure
restraining
their
mirth
until
they
gained
the
and
jerry
was
about
to
follow
when
captain
bradshaw
caught
him
by
the
arm
stop
my
young
gentleman
you
not
had
your
yet
i
had
quite
sufficient
sir
i
thank
you
replied
jerry
an
excellent
dinner
many
thanks
to
your
hospitality
yes
but
i
must
now
give
you
your
dessert
i
had
my
dessert
and
coffee
too
sir
said
jerry
trying
to
escape
but
you
have
not
had
your
and
i
can
not
permit
you
to
leave
the
cabin
without
it
steward
desire
a
boatswain
mate
to
bring
his
cat
and
a
to
come
here
with
seizings
jerry
was
now
in
a
stew
the
inflexible
countenance
of
captain
bradshaw
showed
that
he
was
in
earnest
however
he
held
his
tongue
until
the
operators
appeared
hoping
that
the
captain
would
think
better
of
it
seize
this
young
gentleman
up
to
the
breach
of
the
gun
will
you
oblige
me
sir
by
letting
me
know
my
offence
no
sir
i
do
not
belong
to
your
ship
continued
jerry
if
i
have
done
wrong
captain
m
is
well
known
to
be
a
strict
officer
and
will
pay
every
attention
to
your
complaint
i
will
save
him
the
trouble
sir
jerry
was
now
seized
up
and
every
arrangement
made
preparatory
to
punishment
well
sir
resumed
jerry
it
must
be
as
you
please
but
i
know
what
captain
m
will
say
what
sir
that
you
were
angry
with
your
officers
whom
you
could
not
punish
and
revenged
yourself
upon
a
poor
boy
would
he
boatswain
mate
where
your
cat
here
sir
how
many
tails
am
i
to
use
oh
give
him
the
whole
nine
why
your
honour
replied
the
man
in
a
compassionate
tone
hardly
room
for
them
there
jerry
who
when
his
indignation
was
roused
cared
little
what
he
said
and
defied
consequences
now
addressed
the
captain
captain
bradshaw
before
you
commence
will
you
allow
me
to
tell
you
what
i
will
call
you
after
the
first
lash
what
sir
what
cried
jerry
with
scorn
why
if
you
cut
me
to
pieces
and
turn
me
out
of
the
service
afterwards
i
will
call
you
a
paltry
coward
and
your
own
conscience
when
you
are
able
to
reflect
will
tell
you
the
same
captain
bradshaw
started
back
with
astonishment
at
such
language
from
a
midshipman
but
he
was
pleased
with
the
undaunted
spirit
of
the
boy
perhaps
he
felt
the
truth
of
the
observation
at
all
events
it
saved
jerry
after
a
short
pause
the
captain
said
cast
him
loose
but
observe
sir
never
let
me
see
your
face
again
while
you
are
in
the
ship
no
nor
any
other
part
of
me
if
i
can
help
it
replied
jerry
buttoning
up
his
clothes
and
making
a
precipitate
escape
by
the
chapter
thirty
five
the
air
no
more
was
vital
now
but
did
a
mortal
poison
grow
the
lungs
which
used
to
fan
the
heart
served
only
now
to
fire
each
part
what
should
refresh
increased
the
smart
and
now
their
very
breath

chiefest
sign
of

not
drop
her
anchor
in
carlisle
bay
until
three
weeks
after
the
arrival
of
the
frigate
which
brought
up
courtenay
and
the
prize
crew
but
she
had
not
been
idle
having
three
valuable
prizes
which
she
had
captured
in
company
courtenay
immediately
repaired
on
board
of
his
ship
to
report
to
captain
m
the
circumstances
which
had
occurred
connected
with
the
loss
of
his
five
men
he
was
too
honourable
to
attempt
to
disguise
or
palliate
the
facts
on
the
contrary
he
laid
all
the
blame
upon
himself
and
enhanced
the
merits
of
the
two
midshipmen
captain
m
who
admired
his
ingenuous
confession
contented
himself
with
observing
that
he
trusted
it
would
be
a
caution
to
him
during
his
future
career
in
the
service
to
seymour
and
jerry
he
said
nothing
as
he
was
afraid
that
the
latter
would
presume
upon
commendation
but
he
treasured
up
their
conduct
in
his
memory
and
determined
to
lose
no
opportunity
that
might
offer
to
reward
them
courtenay
descended
to
the
where
he
was
warmly
greeted
by
his
messmates
who
crowded
round
him
to
listen
to
his
detail
of
the
attempt
to
recapture
well
observed
price
it
appears
we
have
had
a
narrow
chance
of
losing
a
messmate
narrow
chance
lose
two

replied
billy
pitts

bye

i
must
not
forget
to
thank
you
for
the
loan
of
that
gentleman
he
has
made
himself
very
useful
and
behaved
very
well
really
massa
courtenay
i

billy

the
nigger

english

handful

dollars
before
they
left
the
vessel
ah
they
real
gentlemen

capon

massa
dam
um
name
i
forgot
and
what
am
i
then
you
black
thief
oh
you
sar
you
very
fine
officer
replied
billy
quitting
the
courtenay
did
not
exactly
like
the
answer
but
there
was
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
as
usual
when
displeased
he
referred
to
his
muttering
something
in
which
the
word
annoying
could
only
be
distinguished
the
breeze
from
the
windsail
blew
some
of
the
snuff
out
of
the
box
into
the
eyes
of
macallan
i
wish
to
heaven
you
would
be
more
careful
courtenay
cried
the
surgeon
in
an
angry
tone
and
stamping
with
the
pain
i
really
beg
your
pardon
replied
courtenay
snuffing
a
vile
habit
i
wish
i
could
leave
it
off
so
do
your
messmates
replied
the
surgeon
i
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
there
can
be
in
a
practice
in
itself
so
nasty
independent
of
the
destruction
of
the
olfactory
powers
it
exactly
for
that
reason
that
i
take
snuff
i
am
convinced
that
i
am
a
gainer
by
the
loss
of
the
power
of
smell
i
consider
it
ungrateful
if
not
wicked
to
say
so
replied
the
surgeon
gravely
the
senses
were
given
to
us
as
a
source
of
enjoyment
true
doctor
answered
courtenay
mimicking
the
language
of
macallan
and
if
i
were
a
savage
in
the
woods
there
could
not
be
a
sense
more
valuable
or
affording
so
much
gratification
as
the
one
in
question
i
should
rise
with
the
sun
and
inhale
the
fragrance
of
the
shrubs
and
flowers
offered
up
in
grateful
incense
to
their
creator
and
i
should
stretch
myself
under
the
branches
of
the
forest
tree
as
evening
closed
and
enjoy
the
faint
perfume
with
which
they
wooed
the
descending
moisture
after
exhaustion
from
the
solar
heat
but
in
civilised
society
where
men
and
things
are
packed
too
closely
together
the
case
is
widely
different
for
one
pleasant
you
encounter
twenty
offensive
smells
and
of
all
the
localities
for
villainous
compounds
a
ship
is
indubitably
the
worst
i
therefore
patronise
which
i
presume
was
intended
for
our
use
or
it
would
not
have
been
created
but
not
for
our
abuse
ah
there
the
rock
that
we
all
split
upon
and
i
with
others
must
plead
guilty
the
greatest
difficulty
in
this
world
is
to
know
when
and
where
to
stop
even
a
philosopher
like
yourself
can
not
do
it
you
allow
your
hypothesis
to
whirl
in
your
brain
until
it
forms
a
vortex
which
swallows
up
everything
that
comes
within
its
influence
a
modern
philosopher
with
his
hypothesis
is
like
a
man
possessed
with
a
devil
in
times
of
yore
and
it
is
not
to
be
cast
out
by
any
human
means
that
i
know
of
as
you
please
replied
macallan
laughing
i
only
deprecated
a
bad
habit
an
hypothesis
is
only
a
habit
a
habit
of
looking
through
a
glass
of
one
peculiar
colour
which
imparts
its
hue
to
all
around
it
we
are
but
creatures
of
habit
luxury
is
nothing
more
than
contracting
fresh
habits
and
having
the
means
of
administering
to
them
doctor
the
more
habits
you
have
to
gratify
the
more
luxuries
you
possess
you
luxuriate
in
the
contemplation
of
nature
price
in
quoting
or
trying
to
quote
shakespeare
billy
pitts
in
his
dictionary
i
in
my
and
surely
we
may
all
continue
to
enjoy
our
harmless
propensities
without
interfering
with
each
other
although
i
must
say
that
those
quotations
of
our
messmate
price
are
most
tryingly
annoying
and
so
is
a
pinch
of
snuff
in
the
eye
i
can
assure
you
replied
macallan
granted
but
we
must
and
take
doctor
in
the
present
case
i
do
care
how
much
you
take
provided
you
give
rejoined
macallan
recovering
his
good
humour
a
messenger
from
captain
m
who
desired
to
speak
with
macallan
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
mr
macallan
said
captain
m
when
the
surgeon
came
into
the
cabin
to
receive
his
commands
i
am
sorry
to
find
from
letters
which
i
have
received
that
the
yellow
fever
is
raging
in
the
other
islands
in
a
most
alarming
manner
and
that
it
has
been
communicated
to
the
squadron
on
the
station
i
am
sorry
to
add
that
i
have
received
a
letter
from
the
governor
here
informing
me
that
it
has
made
its
appearance
at
the
barracks
i
am
afraid
that
we
have
little
chance
of
escaping
so
general
a
visitation
as
it
is
impossible
to
put
to
sea
even
if
my
orders
were
not
decisive
to
the
contrary
are
there
not
some
precautions
which
ought
to
be
taken
certainly
sir
it
will
be
prudent
to
fumigate
the
lower
deck
it
has
already
been
so
well
ventilated
and
whitewashed
that
nothing
else
can
be
done
we
must
hope
for
the
best
i
do
so
replied
captain
m
but
my
hope
is
mingled
with
anxious
apprehensions
which
i
can
not
control
we
must
do
all
we
can
and
leave
the
rest
to
providence
the
fears
of
captain
m
were
but
too
well
grounded
for
some
days
no
symptoms
of
infection
appeared
on
board
of
the
but
the
ravages
on
shore
among
the
troops
were
to
such
an
extent
that
the
hospitals
were
filled
and
those
who
were
carried
in
might
truly
be
said
to
have
left
hope
behind
rapid
as
was
the
mortality
it
was
still
not
rapid
enough
for
the
admittance
of
those
who
were
attacked
with
the
fatal
disease
and
as
the
bodies
of
fifteen
or
twenty
were
each
succeeding
evening
borne
unto
the
grave
the
continual
decrease
of
the
military
which
attended
the
last
obsequies
told
the
sad
tale
that
those
who
but
a
day
or
two
before
had
followed
the
corpses
of
others
were
now
carried
on
their
own
biers
other
vessels
on
the
station
which
had
put
to
sea
from
the
different
isles
with
the
disappointed
expectation
of
avoiding
the
contagion
now
came
to
an
anchor
in
the
bay
their
crews
so
weakened
by
disease
and
death
that
they
could
with
difficulty
send
up
sufficient
men
to
furl
their
sails
boat
after
boat
was
sent
on
shore
to
the
naval
hospital
loaded
with
sufferers
until
it
became
so
crowded
that
no
more
could
be
received
still
the
from
the
precautions
which
had
been
taken
in
fumigating
and
avoiding
all
unnecessary
contact
with
the
shipping
and
the
shore
had
for
nearly
a
fortnight
escaped
the
infection
but
the
miasma
was
at
last
wafted
to
the
frigate
and
in
the
course
of
one
night
fifteen
men
who
were
in
health
the
preceding
evening
before
eight
on
the
following
morning
were
lying
in
their
hammocks
under
the
before
the
close
of
that
day
the
number
of
patients
had
increased
to
upwards
of
forty
the
hospitals
were
so
crowded
that
captain
m
agreed
with
macallan
that
it
would
be
better
that
the
men
should
remain
on
board
the
frigate
was
anchored
with
springs
on
her
cable
so
as
always
to
be
able
to
warp
her
stern
to
the
breeze
the
cabin
on
the
and
the
below
were
removed
and
the
stern
windows
and
ports
thrown
open
to
admit
a
freer
circulation
of
air
than
could
have
been
obtained
by
riding
with
her
head
to
the
sullen
breeze
which
hardly
deigned
to
fan
the
scorching
cheeks
of
the
numerous
and
exhausted
patients
the
numbers
on
the
list
daily
increased
until
every
part
of
the
ship
was
occupied
with
their
hammocks
and
the
surgeon
and
his
assistants
had
scarcely
time
to
relieve
one
by
excessive
bleeding
and
consign
him
to
his
hammock
before
another
staggering
and
fainting
under
the
rapid
disease
presented
himself
with
his
arm
bared
ready
for
the
lancet
more
blood
was
thrown
into
the
stagnant
water
of
the

a

for
our
laurels
flourish
not
from
the
dew
of
heaven
but
must
be

alas
too
soon
more
bodies
were

in
the
warmest
proof
of
courage
and
perseverance
in
her
country

it
is
a
scene
like
this
which
appals
the
sailor
heart
it
is
not
the

of
hammocks
on

tenanted
by
pale

and

of

past
all
medical
relief
still
the
passage
from
this
transitory
world
is
soothed
by
the
affectionate
sympathy
of
their
messmates
by
the
promise
to
execute
their
last
wishes
by
the
knowledge
that
it
was
in
their
country
defence
they
nobly
fell
is
not
the
chance
of
wreck
or
of
being
consigned
unshrouded
to
the
dark
wave
by
the
treacherous
leak
or
overwhelming
fury
of
the

not

all
of
these
they
are
prepared
and
are
resigned
to
meet
as
ills
to
which
their
devious
track
is
heir
but
when
disease
in
its
most
loathsome
form
and
implacable
nature
makes
its
appearance
when
we
contemplate
in
perspective
our
own
fate
in
the
unfortunate
who
is
selected
like
the
struggling
sheep
dragged
from
the
hurdled
crowd
to
be
pierced
by
the
knife
of
the
butcher
when
the
horror
of
infection
becomes
so
strong
that
we
hold
aloof
from
administering
the
kind
offices
of
relief
to
our
dearest
friends
and
eventually
prostrated
ourselves
find
the
same
regard
for
self
pervades
the
rest
and
that
there
is
no
voluntary
attendance
then
the
sight
of
the
expiring
wretch
in
his
last
effort
turning
his
head
over
the
side
of
his
hammock
and
throwing
off
the
dreadful
black
vomit
harbinger
of
his
doom
is
horrible
too
horrible
and
the
anxiety
which
we
would
in
vain
suppress
the
reckless
laugh
of
some
raised
but
to
conceal
their
fear
from
human
penetration
the
intoxicating
draught
poured
down
by
others
to
dull
the
excited
senses
the
follies
of
years
reviewed
in
one
short
minute
our
life
how
spent
how
much
to
answer
for
a
world
how
overvalued
a
god
how
much
neglected
the
feeling
that
we
ought
to
pray
the
inclination
that
propels
us
to
do
so
checked
by
the
mistaken
yet
indomitable
pride
which
puts
the
question
to
our
manhood
will
ye
pray
in
fear
when
ye
neglected
it
in
fancied
security
down
stubborn
knees
pride
is
but
folly
towards
men
insanity
towards
god
but
why
dwell
upon
such
a
scene
let
it
suffice
to
state
that
seventy
of
the
men
fell
victims
to
the
baneful
climate
and
that
many
more
who
did
recover
were
left
in
such
a
state
of
exhaustion
as
to
require
their
immediate
return
to
their
native
shores

who
for
many
months
had
been
drinking
the
toast
of
a
bloody
war
and
sickly
season
fell
a
sacrifice
to
their
own
thoughtless
and
selfish
desire

anticipated
promotion

he
heard
that
the
purser
was
attacked

do
declare

such
was
the
cry
of
men
at
the
time
of
the
prophet
and
such
it
will
continue
until
all
prophecies
are
accomplished
all
revelations
confirmed
man
is
constant
in
nought
but
inconsistency
he
is
directed
to
take
pattern
from
the
industrious
bee
and
lay
up
the
sweet
treasures
which
have
been
prepared
for
his
use
but
he
prefers
the
giddy
flight
of
the
butterfly
pursuing
his
idle
career
from
flower
to
flower
until
fatigued
with
the
rapidity
of
his
motions
he
reposes
for
a
time
and
revolves
in
his
mind
where
he
shall
bend
his
devious
way
in
search
of
something
new
this
is
the
fatal
propensity
by
which
our
first
parents
fell
and
which
inherited
by
us
is
the
occasion
of
our
follies
and
our
crimes
were
man
but
constant
he
were
perfect
but
that
he
can
not
be
he
is
aware
of
the
dangers
the
hardships
of
travel
of
the
difference
between
offices
performed
by
an
interested
and
heartless
world
and
the
sweet
ministering
of
duty
and
affection
he
feels
that
home
sweet
home
is
the
heaven
of
such
imperfect
bliss
as
this
world
can
bestow
yet
wander
he
must
that
he
may
appreciate
its
value
and
although
he
hails
it
with
rapture
soon
after
his
return
it
palls
upon
him
and
he
quits
it
again
in
search
of
variety
thus
is
man
convinced
of
the
beauty
of
virtue
and
acknowledges
the
peace
that
is
to
be
found
in
her
abode
yet
propelled
by
the
restless
legacy
of
our
first
parents
he
wanders
into
the
entangled
labyrinths
of
vice
until
satisfied
that
all
is
vexation
he
retraces
his
steps
in
repentance
and
disgust
thus
he
passes
his
existence
in
sinning
repenting
and
sinning
again
in
search
of
something
new
when
mr
rainscourt
was
first
separated
from
his
wife
he
felt
himself
released
from
a
heavy
burthen
which
had
oppressed
him
for
years
or
as
if
fetters
which
had
been
long
riveted
had
been
knocked
off
and
he
congratulated
himself
upon
his
regained
liberty
plunging
at
once
into
the
depths
of
vice
and
dissipation
he
sought
pleasure
after
pleasure
variety
upon
variety
all
that
life
could
offer
or
money
purchase
and
for
a
time
thought
himself
happy
but
there
are
drawbacks
which
can
not
be
surmounted
and
he
who
wholly
associates
with
the
vicious
must
more
than
any
other
be
exposed
to
the
effects
of
depravity
he
found
man
more
than
ever
treacherous
and
ungrateful
woman
more
than
ever
deceiving
indulgence
cloying
debauchery
enervating
and
his
constitution
and
his
spirits
exhausted
by
excess
satiated
with
everything
disgusted
with
everybody
he
sought
for
something
new
for
more
than
two
years
he
had
not
seen
and
had
hardly
bestowed
a
thought
upon
his
wife
and
daughter
who
still
continued
to
reside
at
the
mansion
at
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
country
air
might
recruit
his
health
and
he
felt
a
degree
of
interest
if
not
for
his
wife
at
least
for
his
daughter
he
determined
therefore
to
pay
them
a
visit
the
horses
were
ordered
and
to
the
astonishment
of
mrs
rainscourt
to
whom
he
had
given
no
intimation
of
his
whim
and
who
looked
upon
a
visit
from
her
husband
in
her
retirement
as
a
visionary
idea
rainscourt
made
his
appearance
just
as
she
was
about
to
sit
down
to
dinner
in
company
with
the
mcelvinas
and
the
vicar
who
had
become
one
of
her
most
intimate
associates
if
rainscourt
was
pleased
with
the
improvement
of
emily
who
was
now
more
than
fourteen
years
old
how
much
more
was
he
astonished
at
the
appearance
of
his
wife
who
to
his
eyes
seemed
even
handsomer
if
possible
than
on
the
day
when
he
had
led
her
to
the
altar
for
more
than
two
years
content
if
not
perfect
happiness
had
been
mrs
rainscourt
lot
she
had
recovered
her
health
her
bloom
and
her
spirits
and
not
having
had
any
source
of
irritation
her
serenity
of
temper
had
been
regained
and
mrs
rainscourt
to
whose
extreme
beauty
from
assuetude
he
had
before
been
blind
now
appeared
to
him
after
so
long
an
absence
quite
a
different
person
from
the
one
whom
he
had
quitted
with
such
indifference
and
as
he
surveyed
her
he
seemed
to
feel
that
freshness
of
delight
unknown
to
vitiated
minds
except
when
successful
in
their
search
after
something
new
but
rainscourt
was
not
altogether
wrong
in
his
idea
that
his
wife
was
quite
a
different
personage
from
the
one
which
he
had
quitted
the
vicar
who
was
acquainted
with
her
situation
had
not
failed
in
his
constant
exertions
for
the
improvement
of
mankind
he
had
by
frequent
conversation
and
inculcation
of
our
christian
duties
gradually
softened
her
into
a
charitable
and
forgiving
temper
and
now
that
she
had
no
opportunity
of
exercising
them
she
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
passive
forbearance
and
humility
constituting
a
part
of
the
duties
of
a
wife
she
met
her
husband
with
kindness
and
respect
while
his
daughter
who
flew
into
his
arms
proved
that
she
had
not
been
prepossessed
against
him
as
he
anticipated
pleased
with
his
reception
and
with
the
company
that
he
happened
to
meet
rainscourt
experienced
sensations
which
had
long
been
dormant
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
an
establishment
with
such
an
elegant
woman
as
mrs
rainscourt
at
the
head
and
his
daughter
beauty
to
grace
it
would
not
only
be
more
gratifying
but
more
reputable
than
the
course
of
life
which
he
had
lately
pursued
he
made
himself
excessively
agreeable
was
pleased
with
the
benevolent
demeanour
of
the
vicar
thought
susan
a
lovely
young
woman
and
mcelvina
a
delightful
companion
and
when
he
retired
to
the
chamber
prepared
for
his
reception
wondered
that
he
had
never
thought
of
paying
them
a
visit
before
it
had
been
the
intention
of
rainscourt
to
have
trespassed
upon
his
wife
hospitality
for
one
night
only
and
then
have
taken
his
departure
for
some
fashionable
watering
place
but
there
seemed
to
be
such
an
appearance
of
renewed
friendship
between
him
and
mrs
rainscourt
that
an
invitation
was
given
by
the
vicar
for
the
whole
party
on
the
ensuing
day
to
meet
at
the
vicarage
and
this
was
followed
up
by
another
from
mcelvina
for
the
day
afterwards
at
his
cottage
this
decided
mr
rainscourt
to
remain
there
a
day
or
two
longer
but
when
the
time
of
his
departure
arrived
rainscourt
was
so
pleased
with
his
new
acquaintance
so
delighted
with
his
daughter
and
to
his
astonishment
so
charmed
by
his
wife
that
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
women
are
proverbially
in
all
where
the
heart
is
concerned
and
mrs
rainscourt
soon
perceived
that
the
admiration
of
her
husband
was
not
feigned
gratified
to
find
that
she
had
not
yet
lost
her
attractions
and
either
from
a
pardonable
feeling
of
revenge
at
his
desertion
or
to
prove
to
him
that
he
was
not
aware
of
what
he
had
rejected
she
exerted
all
her
powers
to
please
she
was
not
only
amiable
but
fascinating
and
after
a
sojourn
of
three
weeks
which
appeared
but
as
many
days
rainscourt
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
was
violently
enamoured
of
his
discarded
wife
he
now
felt
that
he
should
assume
a
higher
station
in
society
by
being
at
the
head
of
his
own
establishment
and
that
his
consequence
would
be
increased
by
the
heiress
of
so
large
a
property
residing
under
his
protection
and
he
thought
that
if
he
could
persuade
mrs
rainscourt
to
live
with
him
again
he
could
be
happy
and
exercise
with
pleasure
the
duties
of
a
father
and
a
husband
neither
the
vicar
nor
mcelvina
were
ignorant
of
his
feelings
and
the
former
who
recollected
that
those
whom
god
has
joined
no
man
should
put
asunder
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bring
the
affair
if
possible
to
a
happy
issue
and
rainscourt
who
perceived
the
influence
which
the
vicar
possessed
over
his
wife
determined
to
request
that
he
would
act
as
a
mediator
the
vicar
was
delighted
when
rainscourt
called
upon
him
one
morning
and
unfolded
his
wishes
to
reconcile
those
who
had
been
at
variance
to
restore
a
husband
to
his
wife
a
father
to
a
daughter
was
the
earnest
desire
of
the
good
man
heart
he
accepted
the
office
with
pleasure
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
while
rainscourt
called
upon
the
mcelvinas
that
he
might
be
out
of
the
way
proceeded
upon
his
mission
of
peace
and
mrs
rainscourt
who
was
not
surprised
at
the
intelligence
listened
to
the
vicar
attentively
as
he
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
forgiveness
if
she
hoped
to
be
forgiven
of
the
conviction
in
his
own
mind
that
her
husband
was
reformed
of
the
unpleasant
remarks
to
which
a
woman
who
is
separated
from
her
husband
must
always
be
subjected
of
the
probability
that
the
faults
were
not
all
on
his
side
and
of
the
advantage
her
daughter
would
derive
from
their
reunion
to
which
he
entreated
her
to
consent
mrs
rainscourt
was
moved
to
tears
the
conflict
between
her
former
love
and
her
outraged
feelings
the
remembrance
of
his
long
neglect
opposed
to
his
present
assiduities
the
stormy
life
she
had
passed
in
his
company
and
her
repose
of
mind
since
their
separation
weighed
and
balanced
against
each
other
so
exactly
that
the
scale
would
turn
on
neither
side
she
refused
to
give
any
decided
answer
but
requested
a
day
or
two
for
reflection
and
the
vicar
who
recollected
the
adage
that
in
an
affair
of
the
heart
the
woman
who
deliberates
is
lost
left
her
with
a
happy
presage
that
his
endeavours
would
be
crowned
with
success
but
mrs
rainscourt
would
not
permit
her
own
heart
to
decide
it
was
a
case
in
which
she
did
not
consider
that
a
woman
was
likely
to
be
a
correct
judge
and
she
had
so
long
been
on
intimate
terms
with
mcelvina
that
she
resolved
to
lay
the
case
before
him
and
be
guided
by
his
opinion
the
next
day
mrs
rainscourt
went
to
the
cottage
alone
and
having
requested
susan
to
exclude
all
visitors
entered
into
a
full
detail
of
all
the
circumstances
which
had
occurred
previous
to
her
separation
from
her
husband
and
the
decision
that
she
was
now
called
upon
to
make
from
his
importunity
susan
who
felt
that
she
was
unable
to
advise
in
a
case
of
such
importance
to
mrs
rainscourt
future
happiness
immediately
referred
the
matter
to
mcelvina
his
answer
was
decided
i
should
be
sorry
mrs
rainscourt
to
give
an
opinion
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
worthy
vicar
did
i
not
conceive
that
his
slight
knowledge
of
the
world
would
in
this
instance
tend
to
mislead
both
himself
and
you
before
mr
rainscourt
had
remained
here
a
week
i
prophesied
as
susan
will
corroborate
that
this
proposal
would
be
made
aware
of
his
general
character
and
of
the
grounds
of
your
separation
i
took
some
pains
to
ingratiate
myself
that
i
might
ascertain
his
real
sentiments
and
with
regret
i
express
my
conviction
that
his
prepossession
in
your
favour
strong
as
it
really
is
at
present
will
but
prove
transitory
and
that
possession
would
only
subject
you
to
future
insults
he
is
reformed
but
satiated
with
other
enjoyments
and
fascinated
with
your
attractions
his
feelings
towards
you
are
those
of
renewed
inclination
and
not
arising
from
conviction
or
remorse
at
his
unprincipled
career
you
are
happy
at
present
your
refusal
may
by
stimulating
his
attentions
increase
your
happiness
but
if
you
yield
it
will
only
be
a
source
of
misery
to
you
both
such
is
my
opinion
do
not
let
him
know
that
i
have
influenced
you
or
it
will
interrupt
an
intimacy
which
i
shall
follow
up
i
trust
to
your
advantage
therefore
give
no
answer
at
present
nor
while
he
remains
here
for
i
perceive
that
he
is
a
violent
man
when
thwarted
in
his
wishes
demand
a
fortnight
consideration
after
he
is
gone
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
decide
from
reflection
without
being
biassed
against
your
own
judgment
by
his
workings
upon
feelings
which
to
the
honour
of
women
when
the
heart
is
concerned
spurn
at
the
cold
reasonings
of
prudence
and
worldly
wisdom
the
advice
of
the
man
of
the
world
prevailed
over
that
of
the
man
of
god
and
rainscourt
after
waiting
in
town
with
impatience
for
the
answer
received
a
decided
but
kind
refusal
he
tore
the
letter
into
fragments
with
indignation
and
set
off
for
cheltenham
more
violently
in
love
with
his
wife
than
he
was
before
her
rejection
of
him
chapter

great

vainly
would

thou

their

rochester
ode
to
nothing
should
you
feel
half
as
tired
with
reading
as
i
am
with
writing
i
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
if
you
throw
down
the
book
and
read
no
more
i
have
written
too
fast
i
have
quite
my
imagination
for
you
must
know
that
this
is
all
every
word
of
it
yet
i
do
not
doubt
but
there
are
many
who
will
find
out
who
the
characters
are
meant
for
notwithstanding
my
assertion
to
the
contrary
well
be
it
so
it
a
very
awkward
position
to
have
to
write
a
chapter
of
sixteen
pages
without
materials
for
more
than
two
at
least
i
find
it
so
some
people
have
the
power
of
spinning
out
a
trifle
of
matter
covering
a
large
surface
with
a
grain
of
ore
like
the
goldbeater
who
out
of
a
single
guinea
will
compose
a
score
of
books
i
wish
i
could
is
there
nothing
to
give
me
an
idea
i
racked
my
sensorium
internally
to
no
purpose
let
me
look
round
the
cabin
for
some
external
object
to
act
as
a
fillip
to
an
exhausted
imagination
a
little
thing
will
well
here
an
that
quite
enough
youths
have
ever
homely
wits
they
say
but
much
as
travel
by
land
may
enlarge
the
mind
it
never
can
be
expanded
to
the
utmost
of
its
capabilities
until
it
has
also
peregrinated
by
water
i
believe
that
not
only
the
human
intellect
but
the
instinct
of
brutes
is
enlarged
by
going
to
sea
the
ant
which
attracted
my
attention
is
one
of
a
nest
in
my
cabin
whose
labours
i
often
superintend
and
i
defy
any
ant
in
any
part
of
the
four
continents
or
wherever
land
may
be
to
show
an
equal
knowledge
of
mechanical
power
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
there
is
originally
a
disproportion
of
intellect
between
one
animal
and
another
of
the
same
species
but
i
consider
that
the
instinct
of
animals
is
capable
of
expansion
as
well
as
the
reason
of
man
the
ants
on
shore
would
if
it
were
required
be
equally
assisted
by
their
instinct
i
believe
but
not
being
required
it
is
not
brought
into
play
and
therefore
as
i
before
observed
they
have
not
the
resources
of
which
my
little
colony
at
present
are
in
possession
now
i
will
kill
a
cockroach
for
them
there
is
no
difficulty
in
finding
one
unfortunately
for
me
for
they
know
everything
that
i
have
there
never
was
a
class
of
animals
so
indifferent
to
their
fare
whether
it
be
paper
or
snuff
or
soap
or
cloth
like
time
they
devour
everything
the
scoundrels
have
nearly
demolished
two
dozen
antibilious
pills
i
hope
they
will
remember
dr
vance
as
long
as
they
live
well
here
one
a
fine
one
i
throw
his
crushed
carcase
on
the
deck
and
observe
the
ants
have
made
their
nest
in
the
beams
over
my
head
from
which
i
infer
that
the
said
beams
are
not
quite
so
sound
as
they
should
be
an
ant
has
passed
by
the
carcase
and
is
off
on
a
gallop
to
give
notice
he
meets
two
or
three
stops
a
second
and
passes
on
now
the
tide
flows
it
not
above
a
minute
since
i
threw
the
cockroach
down
and
now
it
is
surrounded
by
hundreds
what
a
bustle
what
running
to
and
fro
they
must
be
giving
orders
see
there
are
fifty
at
least
who
lay
hold
of
each
separate
leg
of
the
monster
who
in
bulk
is
equal
to
eight
thousand
of
them
the
body
moves
along
with
rapidity
and
they
have
gained
the
side
of
the
cabin
now
for
the
ascent
see
how
those
who
hold
the
lower
legs
have
quitted
them
and
pass
over
to
assist
the
others
at
the
upper
as
there
is
not
room
for
all
to
lay
hold
of
the
creature
legs
those
who
can
not
fix
their
forceps
round
the
bodies
of
the
others
them
as
we
call
it
away
they
go
up
the
side
of
the
ship
a
pull
and
all
together
but
now
the
work
becomes
more
perilous
for
they
have
to
convey
the
body
to
their
nest
over
my
head
which
is
three
feet
from
the
side
of
the
ship
how
can
they
possibly
carry
that
immense
weight
walking
with
their
heads
downwards
and
clinging
with
their
feet
to
the
beams
observe
how
carefully
they
turn
the
corner
what
bustle
and
confusion
in
making
their
arrangements
now
they
start
they
have
brought
the
body
with
the
ship
so
that
all
the
legs
are
exactly
opposed
to
each
other
in
the
direction
in
which
they
wish
to
proceed
one
of
the
legs
on
the
fore
side
is
advanced
to
its
full
stretch
while
all
the
others
remain
stationary
that
leg
stops
and
the
ants
attached
to
it
hold
on
with
the
rest
while
another
of
the
foremost
legs
is
advanced
thus
they
continue
until
all
the
foremost
are
out
and
the
body
of
the
animal
is
suspended
by
its
legs
at
its
full
stretch
now
one
of
the
hindmost
legs
closes
in
to
the
body
while
all
the
others
hold
on
now
another
and
another
each
in
their
turn
and
by
this
skilful
manoeuvre
they
have
contrived
to
advance
the
body
nearly
an
inch
along
the
ceiling
one
of
the
foremost
legs
advances
again
and
they
proceed
as
before
could
your
ants
have
managed
this
i
have
often
watched
them
when
a
boy
because
my
grandmother
used
to
make
me
do
so
in
later
days
because
i
delighted
in
their
industry
and
perseverance
but
alas
in
neither
case
did
i
profit
by
their
example
now
freddy
the
old
lady
would
say
giving
her
spectacles
a
preparatory
wipe
as
she
basked
in
a
summer
evening
sun
after
a
five
tea
fetch
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
and
we
will
see
the
ants
work
lord
bless
the
boy
if
he
has
thrown
down
a
whole
slice
why
do
you
waste
good
victuals
in
that
way
who
do
you
think
to
eat
it
after
it
has
been
on
the
gravel
there
pinch
a
bit
off
and
throw
it
down
put
the
rest
back
upon
the
plate
it
will
do
for
the
cat
but
these
ants
were
no
more
to
be
compared
to
mine
than
a
common
labourer
is
to
the
engineer
who
directs
the
mechanical
powers
which
raise
mountains
from
their
foundation
my
old
grandmother
would
never
let
me
escape
until
the
bread
and
butter
was
in
the
hole
and
what
was
worse
i
had
then
to
listen
to
the
moral
inference
which
was
drawn
and
which
took
up
more
time
than
the
ants
did
to
draw
the
bread
and
butter
all
about
industry
and
what
not
a
long
story
partly
her
own
partly
borrowed
from
solomon
but
it
was
labour
in
vain
i
could
not
understand
why
because
ants
like
bread
and
butter
i
must
like
my
book
she
was
an
excellent
old
woman
but
nevertheless
many
a
time
did
i
have
a
with
the
boy
in
the
caricature
print
who
is
sitting
with
his
old
grandmother
and
the
cat
and
says
i
wish
one
of
us
three
were
dead
it
a
i
and
it
a
you
pussy
well
she
died
at
last
full
of
years
and
honour
and
i
was
summoned
from
school
to
attend
her
funeral
my
uncle
was
much
affected
for
she
had
been
an
excellent
mother
she
might
have
been
so
but
i
graceless
boy
could
not
perceive
her
merits
as
a
and
showed
a
great
deal
of
fortitude
upon
the
occasion
i
recollect
a
circumstance
attendant
upon
her
funeral
which
connected
as
it
was
with
a
subsequent
one
has
since
been
the
occasion
of
serious
reflection
upon
the
trifling
causes
which
will
affect
the
human
mind
when
prostrate
under
affliction
my
grandmother
remains
were
consigned
to
an
old
family
vault
not
far
from
the
river
when
the
last
ceremonies
had
been
paid
and
the
coffin
was
being
lowered
into
the
deep
receptacle
of
generations
which
had
passed
away
i
looked
down
and
it
was
full
of
water
nearly
up
to
the
arch
of
the
vault
observing
my
surprise
and
perceiving
the
cause
my
uncle
was
much
annoyed
at
the
circumstance
but
it
was
too
late
the
cords
had
been
removed
and
my
grandmother
had
sunk
to
the
bottom
my
uncle
interrogated
the
sexton
after
the
funeral
service
was
over
why
sir
it
because
it
now
in
the
river
she
will
be
all
dry
before
the
evening
this
made
the
matter
worse
if
she
was
all
in
the
evening
she
would
be
all
afloat
again
in
the
morning
it
was
no
longer
a
place
of
rest
and
my
uncle
grief
was
much
increased
by
the
idea
for
a
long
while
afterwards
he
appeared
uncommonly
thoughtful
at
spring
tides
but
although
his
grief
yielded
to
time
the
impression
was
not
to
be
effaced
many
years
afterwards
a
fair
cousin
was
summoned
from
the
world
before
she
had
time
to
enter
upon
the
duties
imposed
upon
the
sex
or
be
convinced
from
painful
experience
that
to
die
is
gain
it
was
then
i
perceived
that
my
uncle
had
contracted
a
sort
of
hydrophobia
he
fixed
upon
a
church
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
ordered
a
vault
to
be
dug
at
a
great
expense
out
of
the
solid
chalk
under
the
chancel
of
the
church
there
it
would
not
only
be
dry
below
but
even
defended
from
the
rain
above
it
was
finished
and
the
last
moisture
to
which
she
was
ever
to
be
subjected
the
tears
of
affection
were
shed
over
her
remains
by
those
who
lost
and
loved
her
when
the
ceremony
was
over
my
uncle
appeared
to
look
down
into
the
vault
with
a
degree
of
satisfaction
there
said
he
she
will
lie
as
dry
as
possible
till
the
end
of
time
and
i
really
believe
that
this
conviction
on
his
part
went
further
to
console
him
than
even
the
aid
of
religion
or
the
ministering
of
affection
he
often
commented
upon
it
and
as
often
as
he
did
so
i
thought
of
my
old
grandmother
and
the
spring
tides
i
had
an
odd
dream
the
other
night
about
my
own
burial
and
subsequent
state
which
was
so
diametrically
opposite
to
my
uncle
ideas
of
comfort
that
i
will
relate
it
here
i
was
dead
but
either
from
politeness
or
affection
i
knew
not
which
the
spirit
still
lingered
with
the
body
and
had
not
yet
taken
its
flight
although
the
tie
between
them
had
been
dissolved
i
had
been
killed
in
action
and
the
of
the
ship
with
mingled
feelings
of
sorrow
and
delight
sorrow
at
my
death
which
was
a
tribute
that
i
did
not
expect
from
him
and
delight
at
his
assumed
promotion
for
the
combat
had
been
brought
to
a
successful
issue
read
the
funeral
service
which
consigned
me
and
some
twenty
others
sewed
up
in
hammocks
to
the
deep
into
which
we
descended
with
one
simultaneous
rush
i
thought
that
we
soon
parted
company
from
each
other
and
all
alone
i
continued
to
sink
sink
sink
until
at
last
i
could
sink
no
deeper
i
was
suspended
as
it
were
i
had
taken
my
exact
position
in
the
scale
of
gravity
and
i
lay
floating
upon
the
condensed
and
buoyant
fluid
many
hundred
fathoms
below
the
surface
i
thought
to
myself
here
then
am
i
to
lie
in
pickle
until
i
am
awakened
it
was
quite
dark
but
by
the
spirit
i
saw
as
plain
as
if
it
were
and
i
perceived
objects
in
the
water
which
gradually
increased
in
size
they
were
sharks
in
search
of
prey
they
attacked
me
furiously
and
as
they
endeavoured
to
drag
me
out
of
my
canvas
cerements
i
whirled
round
and
round
as
their
flat
noses
struck
against
my
sides
at
last
they
succeeded
in
a
moment
i
was
dismembered
without
the
least
pain
for
pain
had
been
left
behind
me
in
the
world
from
which
i
had
been
released
one
separated
a
leg
with
his
sharp
teeth
and
darted
away
north
another
an
arm
and
steered
south
each
took
his
portion
and
appeared
to
steer
away
in
a
different
direction
as
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
interrupted
in
his
digestion
help
yourselves
gentlemen
help
yourselves
mentally
exclaimed
i
but
if
mr
young
is
correct
in
his
thoughts
where
am
i
to
fumble
for
my
bones
when
they
are
to
be
forthcoming
nothing
was
left
but
my
head
and
that
from
superior
gravity
continued
to
sink
gyrating
in
its
descent
so
as
to
make
me
feel
quite
giddy
but
it
had
not
gone
far
before
one
who
had
not
received
his
portion
darted
down
upon
it
perpendicularly
and
as
the
last
fragment
of
me
rolled
down
his
enormous
gullet
the
spirit
fled
and
all
was
darkness
and
oblivion
but
i
have
digressed
sadly
from
the
concatenation
of
ideas
the
ant
made
me
think
of
my
grandmother
my
grandmother
of
my
uncle
my
uncle
of
my
cousin
and
her
death
of
my
dream
for
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
our
little
lives
are
rounded
with
a
sleep
but
i
had
not
finished
all
i
had
to
say
relative
to
the
inferior
animals
when
on
board
of
a
not
only
is
their
instinct
expanded
but
they
almost
change
their
nature
from
their
immediate
contact
with
human
beings
and
become
tame
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
man
had
dominion
given
unto
him
over
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
fiercest
of
the
feline
race
will
not
attack
but
avoid
him
unless
goaded
on
by
the
most
imperious
demands
of
hunger
and
it
is
a
fact
that
there
is
a
power
in
the
eye
of
man
to
which
all
other
animals
quail
what
then
must
it
be
to
an
animal
who
is
brought
on
board
and
is
in
immediate
collision
with
hundreds
whose
fearless
eyes
meet
his
in
every
direction
in
which
he
turns
and
whose
behaviour
towards
him
corresponds
with
their
undaunted
looks
the
animal
is
subdued
at
once
i
remember
a
leopard
which
was
permitted
to
run
loose
after
he
had
been
three
days
on
board
although
it
was
thought
necessary
to
bring
him
in
an
iron
cage
he
had
not
been
in
the
ship
more
than
a
fortnight
when
i
observed
the
captain
of
the
rubbing
the
nose
of
the
animal
against
the
deck
for
some
offence
which
he
had
committed
why
you
have
pretty
well
brought
that
gentleman
to
his
bearings
observed
i
he
as
tame
as
a
puppy
tame
why
sir
he
knows
better
than
to
be
otherwise
i
wish
the
of
would
send
us
on
board
a
tame
him
in
a
week
and
i
believe
the
man
was
correct
in
his
assertion
the
most
remarkable
change
of
habit
that
i
ever
witnessed
was
in
a
wether
sheep
on
board
of
a
frigate
during
the
war
he
was
one
of
a
stock
which
the
captain
had
taken
on
board
for
a
long
cruise
and
being
the
only
survivor
during
the
time
that
the
ship
was
refitting
he
had
been
allowed
to
run
about
the
decks
and
had
become
such
a
favourite
with
the
ship
company
that
the
idea
of
his
being
killed
even
when
short
of
fresh
provisions
never
even
entered
into
the
head
of
the
captain
jack
for
such
was
his
cognomen
lived
entirely
with
the
men
being
fed
with
biscuit
from
the
different
messes
he
knew
the
meaning
of
the
different
pipes
of
the
boatswain
mates
and
always
went
below
when
they
piped
to
breakfast
dinner
or
supper
but
amongst
other
peculiarities
he
would
chew
tobacco
and
drink
grog
is
it
to
be
wondered
therefore
that
he
was
a
favourite
with
the
sailors
that
he
at
first
did
this
from
obedience
is
possible
but
eventually
he
was
as
fond
of
grog
as
any
of
the
men
and
when
the
pipe
gave
notice
of
serving
it
out
he
would
run
aft
to
the
tub
and
wait
his
turn
for
an
extra
of
water
was
by
general
consent
thrown
into
the
tub
when
the
grog
was
mixed
that
jack
might
have
his
regular
allowance
from
habit
the
animal
knew
exactly
when
his
turn
came
there
were
eighteen
messes
in
the
ship
and
as
they
were
called
by
the
purser
steward
or
sergeant
of
marines
in
rotation
first
mess
second
mess
after
the
last
mess
was
called
jack
presented
himself
at
the
tub
and
received
his
allowance
now
it
sometimes
occurred
that
a
mess
when
called
would
miss
its
turn
by
the
man
deputed
to
receive
the
liquor
not
being
present
upon
which
occasion
the
other
messes
were
served
in
rotation
and
the
one
who
had
not
appeared
to
the
call
was
obliged
to
wait
till
after
all
the
rest
but
a
circumstance
of
this
kind
always
created
a
great
deal
of
mirth
for
the
sheep
who
knew
that
it
was
his
turn
after
the
eighteenth
or
last
mess
would
butt
away
any
one
who
attempted
to
interfere
and
if
the
party
persevered
in
being
served
before
jack
he
would
become
quite
outrageous
flying
at
the
offender
and
butting
him
forward
into
the
galley
and
sometimes
down
the
hatchway
before
his
anger
could
be
appeased
from
which
it
would
appear
that
the
animal
was
passionately
fond
of
spirits
this
i
consider
as
great
a
change
in
the
nature
of
a
ruminating
animal
as
can
well
be
imagined
i
could
mention
many
instances
of
this
kind
but
i
shall
reserve
them
till
i
have
grown
older
then
i
will
be
as
garrulous
as
montaigne
as
it
is
i
think
i
hear
the
reader
say
all
this
may
be
very
true
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
novel
nothing
i
grant
but
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
a
for
i
have
completed
a
whole
chapter
out
of
nothing
chapter
thirty
eight
and
with
a
flowing
sail
went
a
bounding
for
the
island
of
the
free
towards
which
the
impatient
wind
blew
half
a
gale
high
dash
the
spray
the
bows
dipp
in
the
sea
byron
after
a
run
of
six
weeks
the
entered
the
channel
the
weather
which
had
been
clear
during
the
passage
home
now
altered
its
appearance
and
a
dark
sky
thick
fog
and
mizzling
cold
rain
intimated
their
approach
to
the
english
shore
but
relaxed
as
they
had
been
by
three
years
endurance
of
a
tropical
sun
it
was
nevertheless
a
source
of
congratulation
rather
than
complaint
for
it
was
regular
november
channel
weather
and
was
associated
with
their
propinquity
to
those
homes
and
firesides
which
would
be
enhanced
in
value
from
the
ordeal
to
be
passed
before
they
could
be
enjoyed
hah
exclaimed
an
old
who
had
served
the
earlier
part
of
his
life
in
a
coaster
as
he
buttoned
his
up
to
the
throat
this
is
what
i
calls
something
like
none
of
your
damned
blue
skies
here
such
is
the
power
of
affection
whether
of
person
or
of
things
that
even
faults
become
a
source
of
endearment
as
the
short
day
closed
the
who
was
running
before
the
wind
and
slanting
rain
which
seemed
to
assist
her
speed
with
its
gravity
hove
to
and
tried
for
soundings
well
stewart
what
the
news
said
one
of
the
midshipmen
as
he
entered
the
berth
the
drops
of
rain
which
hung
upon
the
rough
exterior
of
his
great
coat
glittering
like
small
diamonds
from
the
reflection
of
the
solitary
candle
which
made
darkness
but
just
visible
news
replied
stewart
taking
off
his
hat
with
a
jerk
so
as
to
besprinkle
the
face
of
prose
with
the
water
that
had
accumulated
on
the
top
of
it
and
laughing
at
his
sudden
start
from
the
unexpected
shower
why
as
the
fellows
roar
out
with
the
second
edition
of
an
evening
paper
news
glorious
news
and
all
comprised
in
a
short
sentence
soundings
in
seventy
four
fathoms
grey
sand
and
shells
huzza
answered
the
old
master
mate
now
for
three
cheers
and
then
for
the
song
the
three
cheers
having
been
given
with
due
emphasis
if
not
discretion
they
all
stood
up
round
the
table
now
my
boys
keep
time
mr
prose
if
you
attempt
to
chime
in
with
your
confounded
nasal
twang
give
you
a
squeeze
for
england
when
with
favouring
gale
our
gallant
ship
up
channel
steer
and
scudding
under
easy
sail
the
high
blue
western
land
appear
to
heave
the
lead
the
seaman
sprung
and
to
the
watchful
pilot
sung
by
the
deep
the
song
roared
out
in
grand
chorus
by
the
midshipmen
was
caught
up
after
the
first
verse
by
the
marines
in
their
berth
close
to
them
and
from
them
passed
along
the
lower
deck
as
it
continued
so
that
the
last
stanzas
were
sung
by
nearly
two
hundred
voices
sending
forth
a
volume
of
sound
that
penetrated
into
every
recess
of
the
vessel
and
entered
into
the
responsive
bosoms
of
all
on
board
not
excepting
the
captain
himself
who
smiled
as
he
bent
over
the
break
of
the
gangway
at
what
he
would
have
considered
a
breach
of
subordination
in
the
company
had
not
he
felt
that
it
arose
from
that
warm
attachment
to
their
country
which
had
created
our
naval
the
song
ended
with
tumultuous
cheering
fore
and
aft
and
not
until
then
did
the
captain
send
down
to
request
that
the
noise
might
be
discontinued
as
soon
as
it
was
over
the
grog
was
loudly
called
for
in
the
midshipmen
berth
and
made
its
appearance
here
to
the
white
cliffs
of
england
cried
one
drinking
off
his
tumbler
and
turning
it
upside
down
on
the
table
here
to
the
land
of
beauty
here
to
the
emerald
isle
and
here
to
the
land
of
cakes
cried
stewart
drinking
off
his
tumbler
and
throwing
it
over
his
shoulder
six
for
one
for
skylarking
cried
prose
a
hundred
for
one
you
damned
cockney
for
all
i
care
no
no
no
cried
all
the
berth
not
for
you
shall
have
a
song
for
it
my
boys
cried
stewart
who
immediately
commenced
with
great
taste
and
execution
the
beautiful
air
should
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot
and
days
o
lang
syne
well
i
not
had
my
toast
yet
said
jerry
when
the
applause
at
the
end
of
the
song
had
discontinued
here
to
the
shady
side
of
and
i
suppose
said
stewart
giving
prose
a
slap
on
the
back
which
took
his
breath
away
that
you
are
thinking
of
wapping
blow
you
i
think
i
have
had
enough
of
whopping
since
i
been
in
this
ship
answered
prose
why
prose
you
quite
brilliant
i
do
declare
observed
jerry
like
a
flint
you
only
require
a
blow
from
stewart
iron
fist
to
emit
sparks
try
him
again
stewart
he
like
one
of
the
dancing
dervishes
in
the
arabian
nights
you
must
thrash
him
to
get
a
few
farthings
of
wit
out
of
him
i
do
wish
that
you
would
keep
your
advice
to
yourself
jerry
my
dear
prose
it
all
for
the
honour
of
middlesex
that
i
wish
you
to
shine
i
convinced
that
there
a
great
deal
of
wit
in
that
head
of
yours
but
it
confined
like
the
kernel
in
a
nut
there
no
obtaining
it
without
breaking
the
shell
try
him
again
stewart
come
prose
i
take
your
part
and
try
his
own
receipt
upon
himself
i
thrash
him
till
he
says
something
witty
i
do
like
that
amazingly
replied
jerry
why
if
i
do
say
a
good
thing
you
never
find
out
i
shall
be
thrashed
to
all
eternity
besides
i
at
too
great
a
distance
from
you
what
do
you
mean
why
i
like
some
cows
i
do
give
down
my
milk
without
the
calf
is
alongside
of
me
now
if
you
were
on
this
side
of
the
table
which
i
am
replied
stewart
as
he
sprang
over
it
and
seizing
jerry
by
the
neck
now
mr
jerry
say
a
good
thing
directly
well
promise
me
to
understand
it
we
are
just
in
the
reverse
situation
of
england
and
scotland
after
the
battle
of
culloden
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
wretch
cried
stewart
whose
wrath
was
kindled
by
the
reference
why
i
in
your
clutches
just
like
scotland
was
a
conquered
country
you
lie
you
little
blackguard
cried
stewart
pinching
jerry
neck
till
he
forced
his
mouth
open
scotland
was
never
conquered
well
then
continued
jerry
whose
bile
was
up
as
soon
as
stewart
relaxed
his
hold
i
like
king
charles
in
the
hands
of
the
scotch
how
much
was
it
that
you
sold
him
for
jerry
shrivelled
carcase
sounded
like
a
drum
from
the
blow
which
he
received
for
this
second
insult
to
stewart
idolised
native
land
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
his
speech
well
have
i
been
very
witty
are
you
content
or
will
you
have
some
more
or
will
you
try
prose
and
see
whether
you
can
draw
blood
out
of
a
turnip
stewart
who
seemed
disinclined
to
have
any
more
elegant
extracts
from
jerry
resumed
his
former
seat
by
prose
who
appeared
to
be
in
deep
reflection
well
prose
are
you
thinking
of
your
friends
in
and
suppose
i
am
stewart
we
have
the
same
feelings
in
the
city
that
you
have
in
the
heather
and
although
i
do
not
like
you
pretend
to
be
allied
to
former
kings
yet
one
may
love
one
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
without
being
able
to
trace
back
to
i
never
disputed
your
high
pretensions
why
then
interfere
with
my
humble
claims
to
the
common
feelings
of
humanity
i
am
rebuked
prose
replied
stewart
you
shall
have
my
glass
of
grog
for
that
speech
for
you
never
made
a
better
give
me
your
hand
my
good
fellow
i
am
glad
that
you
at
last
show
some
symptoms
of
reason
observed
the
still
indignant
jerry
standing
close
to
the
door
i
have
some
hopes
of
your
majesty
yet
after
such
an
extraordinary
concession
on
your
part
you
must
have
great
reason
to
be
proud
that
you
are
able
to
trace
your
pedigree
up
to
a
border
chieftain
who
sallied
forth
on
the
foray
when
the
spurs
were
dished
up
for
his
dinner
or
in
plain
words
went
a
cattle
stealing
and
robbing
those
who
could
not
resist
it
might
then
be
considered
a
mark
of
prowess
but
times
are
altered
now
and
if
your
celebrated
ancestor
lived
in
the
present
time
why
continued
jerry
pointing
his
finger
under
his
left
ear
he
would
receive
what
he
well
deserved
that
all
by
him
that
made
me
get
out
of
my
reach
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
murder
you
cried
stewart
pale
with
rage
i
took
care
of
that
replied
jerry
before
i
ventured
to
give
my
opinion
and
now
that
i
ready
for
a
start
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
trace
your
ancestors
as
far
back
as
you
can
as
long
as
they
have
continued
to
be
honest
men
if
you
do
stop
there
you
are
a
and
jerry
very
prudently
made
his
escape
at
the
conclusion
of
his
sentence
the
hour
of
retribution
will
come
cried
stewart
after
jerry
as
the
latter
sprang
up
the
ladder
but
it
did
not
for
when
they
met
next
morning
it
was
to
feast
their
eyes
upon
the
chalky
cliffs
of
the
isle
of
wight
as
the
steered
for
the
needles
there
are
two
events
on
board
of
a
after
which
injuries
are
forgotten
apologies
are
offered
and
received
intended
duels
are
suppressed
hands
are
exchanged
in
friendship
and
drives
away
animosity
one
is
after
an
action
another
upon
the
sight
of
native
land
after
a
protracted
absence
jerry
fearlessly
ranged
up
alongside
of
stewart
as
he
looked
over
the
gangway
we
shall
be
at
anchor
by
twelve
you
may
bless
your
stars
for
it
replied
stewart
with
a
significant
smile
the
now
ran
through
the
needles
and
having
successively
passed
by
hurst
castle
cowes
and
the
entrance
to
southampton
water
brought
up
at
spithead
in
seven
fathoms
the
sails
were
furled
the
ship
was
moored
the
boat
was
manned
and
captain
m
went
on
shore
to
report
himself
to
the
port
admiral
and
deliver
his
despatches
when
the
boat
returned
it
brought
off
letters
which
had
been
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
ship
one
informed
jerry
of
the
death
of
his
father
and
of
his
being
in
possession
of
a
fortune
which
enabled
him
to
retire
from
the
service
another
from
the
admiralty
announced
the
promotion
of
stewart
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
and
one
from
mcelvina
to
our
hero
inviting
him
to
take
up
his
quarters
at
his
house
as
long
as
the
service
would
permit
stating
that
captain
m
had
been
written
to
to
request
that
he
might
be
allowed
leave
of
absence
as
soon
as
captain
m
had
received
an
answer
from
the
admiralty
he
returned
on
board
and
acquainted
his
officers
that
he
had
obtained
leave
to
remain
on
shore
for
some
time
for
the
of
his
health
and
that
another
captain
would
be
appointed
to
the
ship
he
turned
the
hands
up
and
addressed
the
ship
company
thanking
them
for
their
good
behaviour
while
under
his
command
and
expressing
his
hopes
that
upon
his
reappointment
he
should
find
them
all
alive
and
well
the
to
his
great
surprise
and
delight
was
presented
with
his
rank
as
commander
which
captain
m
had
solicited
from
the
admiralty
the
men
were
dismissed
and
captain
m
bidding
farewell
to
his
officers
descended
the
side
and
shoved
off
as
soon
as
the
boat
was
clear
of
the
frigate
the
men
without
orders
ran
up
and
manning
the
shrouds
saluted
him
with
three
farewell
cheers
captain
m
took
off
his
hat
to
the
compliment
and
muffling
up
his
face
with
his
to
conceal
his
emotion
the
boat
pulled
for
the
shore
seymour
who
was
in
the
boat
followed
his
captain
to
the
inn
who
informed
him
that
he
had
obtained
his
discharge
into
a
that
his
time
might
go
on
and
leave
of
absence
for
two
months
which
he
might
spend
with
his
friend
mcelvina
captain
m
then
dismissed
him
with
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
desiring
him
to
write
frequently
and
to
draw
upon
his
agent
if
he
required
any
pecuniary
assistance
seymour
heart
was
full
and
he
could
not
answer
his
kind
protector
he
returned
on
board
and
bidding
farewell
to
his
messmates
the
next
evening
he
had
arrived
at
the
cottage
of
mcelvina
that
his
reception
was
cordial
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
state
mcelvina
whose
marriage
had
not
been
blessed
with
a
family
felt
towards
our
hero
as
if
he
was
his
own
child
and
susan
was
delighted
with
the
handsome
exterior
and
winning
manners
of
the
lad
whose
boyish
days
had
often
been
the
theme
of
her
husband
conversation
if
the
reader
will
take
the
trouble
to
reckon
with
his
fingers
he
will
find
that
william
seymour
is
now
sixteen
years
old
if
he
will
not
he
must
take
my
word
for
it
and
it
may
also
be
as
well
to
inform
him
that
miss
rainscourt
is
more
than
fourteen
i
am
the
more
particular
in
mentioning
these
chronological
facts
because
in
the
next
chapter
i
intend
to
introduce
the
parties
to
each
other
chapter
thirty
nine
a
strong
bull
stands
furious
war
he
flourishes
his
horns
looks
sourly
round
and
hoarsely
bellowing
traverses
his
ground
blackmore
it
was
on
the
second
day
after
the
arrival
of
seymour
that
emily
who
was
not
aware
of
the
addition
to
the
party
at
the
cottage
proceeded
on
foot
through
the
park
and
field
adjacent
to
pay
susan
a
visit
she
was
attended
by
a
in
livery
who
carried
some
books
which
mrs
mcelvina
had
expressed
a
desire
to
read
when
emily
had
arrived
at
the
last
field
which
was
rented
by
a
farmer
hard
by
she
was
surprised
to
perceive
that
it
was
occupied
by
an
unpleasant
tenant
to
wit
a
large
bull
who
on
their
approach
commenced
pawing
the
ground
and
showing
every
symptom
of
hostility
she
quickened
her
pace
and
as
the
animal
approached
found
that
she
had
gained
much
nearer
to
the
stile
before
her
than
to
the
one
which
she
had
just
passed
over
and
frightened
as
she
was
she
determined
to
proceed
the
servant
who
accompanied
her
manifested
more
fear
than
she
did
as
the
bull
approached
emily
who
had
heard
what
precautions
should
be
taken
in
a
similar
exigence
turned
her
face
towards
the
animal
and
walked
backwards
to
the
stile
the
domestic
seemed
determined
to
preserve
the
exact
station
which
his
duty
and
respect
required
and
kept
himself
behind
his
young
mistress
as
however
the
bull
advanced
and
seemed
inclined
to
charge
upon
them
his
fears
would
not
permit
him
to
remain
in
that
situation
and
throwing
down
the
books
he
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
for
a
gap
in
the
hedge
by
this
manoeuvre
emily
was
left
to
make
any
arrangements
she
pleased
with
the
infuriated
animal
but
the
bull
had
no
quarrel
with
a
lady
dressed
in
a
white
muslin
frock
he
had
taken
offence
at
the
red
plush
inexpressibles
which
were
a
part
of
the
family
livery
and
immediately
ran
at
the
servant
passing
emily
without
notice
the
terrified
man
threw
himself
in
an
agony
of
fright
into
the
gap
but
was
so
paralysed
with
fear
that
he
had
no
strength
to
force
his
passage
through
with
his
head
and
shoulders
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
there
he
stuck
on
his
hands
and
knees
offering
a
fair
target
to
the
bull
who
flew
at
it
with
such
violence
that
he
forced
him
several
yards
in
the
opposite
field
senseless
and
exhausted
he
lay
there
more
from
fear
than
injury
while
the
roaring
bull
paced
up
and
down
the
hedge
with
his
tail
in
the
air
attempting
in
vain
to
force
a
passage
in
pursuit
of
the
object
of
his
detestation
the
mind
of
woman
is
often
more
powerful
than
her
frame
and
the
one
will
bear
up
against
circumstances
in
which
the
other
will
succumb
thus
it
was
with
emily
who
reached
the
stile
clambered
over
it
with
difficulty
and
attaining
the
house
of
mcelvina
which
was
but
a
few
yards
distant
felt
that
her
powers
failed
her
as
soon
as
exertion
was
no
longer
required
with
difficulty
she
perceived
with
her
swimming
eyes
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
parlour
and
faintly
exclaiming
o
mr
mcelvina
fell
senseless
into
the
arms
of
william
seymour
mr
and
mrs
mcelvina
were
not
at
home
they
had
walked
to
the
vicarage
and
seymour
who
was
very
busy
finishing
a
sketch
of
the
for
his
hostess
had
declined
accompanying
them
in
their
visit
his
surprise
at
finding
a
young
lady
in
his
arms
may
easily
be
imagined
but
great
as
was
his
surprise
his
distress
was
greater
from
the
extreme
novelty
of
the
situation
it
was
not
that
he
was
unaccustomed
to
female
society
on
the
contrary
his
captain
had
introduced
him
everywhere
in
the
different
ports
of
the
colonies
in
which
they
had
anchored
and
perhaps
there
is
no
better
society
although
limited
than
is
to
be
met
with
at
the
table
of
a
colonial
governor
but
here
it
was
quite
different
he
had
been
habituated
to
follow
in
the
wake
as
the
lady
governess
made
sail
for
the
the
whole
fleet
forming
two
lines
abreast
in
close
order
and
then
coming
to
an
anchor
in
beautiful
precision
to
attack
the
dinner
which
surrendered
at
discretion
he
had
been
habituated
to
the
where
the
ladies
glided
over
the
chalked
floor
like
so
many
beautiful
yachts
plying
in
southampton
water
on
a
fine
day
he
had
tired
his
rate
of
sailing
down
the
middle
of
a
country
dance
with
some
fair
partner
and
tacked
and
wore
as
required
to
the
mazes
of
poussette
and
right
and
left
this
was
all
plain
sailing
but
the
case
was
now
quite
different
here
was
a
strange
sail
who
had
not
even
shown
her
number
taken
aback
in
stays
and
on
her
in
a
squall
seymour
knew
nothing
about
fainting
sometimes
a
man
had
fits
on
board
a
ship
although
invariably
discharged
when
it
was
known
but
the
only
remedy
in
a
in
such
cases
was
to
lay
the
patient
down
between
the
guns
and
let
him
at
his
own
leisure
it
was
impossible
to
act
so
in
this
case
and
seymour
as
he
bent
over
the
beautiful
pale
countenance
of
emily
felt
that
he
never
could
be
tired
of
holding
her
in
his
arms
however
as
it
was
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
he
laid
her
down
on
the
sofa
and
seizing
the
pulled
it
violently
for
assistance
the
wire
had
been
previously
slackened
and
the
force
which
seymour
used
brought
down
the
rope
without
ringing
the
bell
there
was
but
one
in
the
room
and
not
choosing
to
leave
emily
he
was
again
compelled
to
rely
on
his
own
resources
what
was
good
for
her
water
there
was
none
in
the
room
except
what
he
had
been
painting
with
and
that
was
desperately
discoloured
with
the
indian
ink
nevertheless
he
snatched
up
his
large
brush
which
he
used
for
his
skies
and
commenced
painting
her
face
and
temples
with
the
discoloured
water
but
without
producing
the
desired
effect
of
what
next
oh
salts
and
burnt
feathers
he
had
read
of
them
in
a
novel
salts
he
had
none
burnt
feathers
were
to
be
procured
there
were
two
live
birds
called
cardinals
belonging
to
mrs
mcelvina
in
a
cage
near
the
window
and
there
was
also
a
stuffed
green
parrot
in
a
glass
case
seymour
showed
his
usual
presence
of
mind
in
his
decision
the
tails
of
the
live
birds
would
in
all
probability
grow
again
that
of
the
stuffed
parrot
never
could
he
put
his
hand
into
the
cage
and
seizing
the
fluttering
proprietors
pulled
out
both
their
long
tails
and
having
secured
the
door
of
the
cage
thrust
the
ends
of
the
feathers
into
the
fire
and
applied
them
frizzing
and
spluttering
to
the
nostrils
of
emily
but
they
were
replaced
in
the
fire
again
and
again
until
they
would
emit
no
more
smoke
and
emily
still
continued
in
a
state
of
insensibility
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
parrot
which
he
knew
mrs
mcelvina
was
partial
to
must
be
sacrificed
a
blow
with
the
poker
demolished
the
glass
and
the
animal
was
wrenched
off
its
perch
and
the
tail
inserted
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
but
burnt
feathers
were
of
no
use
and
seymour
when
he
had
burnt
down
the
parrot
tail
to
the
stump
laid
it
upon
the
table
in
despair
he
now
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
and
the
beauty
of
the
object
heightened
his
pity
and
commiseration
his
anxiety
increased
to
that
degree
that
losing
his
presence
of
mind
and
giving
way
to
his
feelings
he
apostrophised
the
inanimate
form
and
hanging
over
it
with
the
tenderness
of
a
mother
over
her
lifeless
child
as
a
last
resource
kissed
its
lips
again
and
again
with
almost
frantic
anxiety
at
the
time
of
his
most
eager
application
of
this
last
remedy
mcelvina
and
susan
entered
the
room
without
his
being
aware
of
their
approach
the
parrot
on
the
table
with
his
tail
still
burning
like
a
slow
match
first
caught
their
eyes
and
as
they
advanced
further
in
there
was
seymour
to
their
astonishment
kissing
a
young
lady
to
whom
he
had
never
been
introduced
and
who
appeared
to
be
quite
passive
to
his
endearments
seymour
cried
mcelvina
what
is
all
this
i
glad
you
come
i
can
not
bring
her
to
i
tried
everything
so
it
appears
why
you
smothered
her
she
black
in
the
face
replied
mcelvina
observing
the
marks
of
the
indian
ink
upon
cheek
susan
who
immediately
perceived
the
condition
of
emily
applied
her
salts
and
desired
mcelvina
to
call
the
women
in
a
few
minutes
whether
it
was
that
the
remedies
were
more
effectual
or
nature
had
resumed
her
powers
emily
opened
her
eyes
and
was
carried
upstairs
into
mrs
mcelvina
room
we
must
return
to
the
servant
who
with
no
other
injury
than
a
severe
contusion
of
the
os
coccygis
from
the
frontal
bone
of
the
bull
recovered
his
senses
and
his
legs
at
the
same
moment
and
never
ceased
exerting
the
latter
until
he
arrived
at
hall
where
he
stated
what
indeed
he
really
believed
to
be
the
case
that
miss
emily
had
been
gored
to
death
by
the
bull
asserting
at
the
same
time
what
was
equally
incorrect
that
he
had
nearly
been
killed
himself
in
attempting
her
rescue
the
tidings
were
communicated
to
mrs
rainscourt
who
frantic
at
the
intelligence
without
bonnet
or
shawl
flew
down
the
park
towards
the
fields
followed
by
all
the
servants
of
the
establishment
armed
with
guns
pitchforks
and
any
other
weapons
that
they
could
obtain
at
the
moment
of
hurry
and
trepidation
they
arrived
at
the
field
the
bull
was
there
waiting
for
them
at
the
stile
for
he
had
observed
them
at
a
distance
and
as
he
was
now
opposed
to
half
a
dozen
pair
of
inexpressibles
instead
of
one
his
wrath
was
proportionally
increased
he
pawed
the
ground
bellowed
and
made
divers
attempts
to
leap
the
stile
which
had
he
effected
it
is
probable
that
more
serious
mischief
would
have
occurred
the
whole
party
stood
aghast
while
mrs
rainscourt
screamed
and
called
for
her
child
her
child
and
attempted
to
recover
her
liberty
from
the
arms
of
those
who
held
her
and
rush
into
the
field
to
her
own
destruction
the
farmer
to
whom
the
animal
belonged
had
heard
his
bellowing
on
the
first
assault
and
had
come
out
to
ascertain
the
cause
he
was
just
in
time
to
behold
the
footman
pushed
through
the
hedge
and
to
witness
the
escape
of
emily
into
the
house
of
mcelvina
intending
to
remove
the
animal
he
returned
to
his
dinner
when
his
resumed
bellowing
summoned
him
again
and
perceiving
the
cause
he
joined
the
party
and
addressing
mrs
rainscourt
the
young
lady
is
all
safe
in
the
gentleman
house
yonder
the
brute
quiet
enough
it
all
along
of
them
red
breeches
that
angers
him
a
bull
ca
abide
safe
do
you
say
thank
god
oh
take
me
to
her
this
way
then
said
the
farmer
leading
her
round
the
hedge
to
the
cottage
of
mcelvina
by
a
more
circuitous
way
susan
had
just
called
up
mcelvina
and
seymour
was
again
left
to
himself
in
the
parlour
when
mrs
rainscourt
bursting
from
those
who
conducted
her
tottered
in
and
sank
exhausted
on
the
sofa
seymour
to
whom
the
whole
affair
was
a
mystery
and
who
had
been
ruminating
upon
it
and
upon
the
sweet
lips
which
he
had
pressed
in
utter
astonishment
cried
out
what
another
not
choosing
in
this
instance
to
trust
to
his
own
resources
he
contented
himself
with
again
shoving
the
parrot
tail
between
the
bars
and
as
he
held
it
to
his
patient
nose
loudly
called
out
for
mcelvina
who
summoned
by
his
appeals
with
many
others
entered
the
room
and
relieved
him
of
his
charge
who
soon
recovered
and
joined
her
daughter
in
the
room
upstairs
the
carriage
had
been
sent
for
to
convey
mrs
rainscourt
and
her
daughter
home
when
they
came
down
into
the
parlour
previous
to
their
departure
seymour
was
formally
introduced
and
received
the
thanks
of
mrs
rainscourt
for
the
attention
which
he
had
paid
to
her
daughter
and
a
general
invitation
to
the
hall
emily
to
whom
susan
had
communicated
the
panacea
to
which
seymour
had
ultimately
resorted
blushed
deeply
as
she
smiled
her
adieus
and
our
hero
as
the
carriage
whirled
away
felt
a
sensation
as
new
to
him
as
that
of
cymon
when
ignited
by
the
rays
of
beauty
which
flashed
from
the
sleeping
iphigenia
chapter
forty
idiots
only
will
be
cozened
twice
dryden
seymour
did
not
fail
to
profit
by
the
invitation
extended
by
mrs
rainscourt
and
soon
became
the
inseparable
companion
of
emily
his
attentions
to
her
were
a
source
of
amusement
to
the
mcelvinas
and
her
mother
who
thought
little
of
a
flirtation
between
a
midshipman
of
sixteen
and
a
girl
that
was
two
years
his
junior
the
two
months
leave
of
absence
having
expired
seymour
was
obliged
to
return
to
the
on
the
books
of
which
his
name
had
been
enrolled
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
he
bade
farewell
to
the
mcelvinas
he
had
kissed
away
the
tears
of
separation
from
the
cheeks
of
emily
and
their
young
love
unalloyed
as
that
between
a
brother
and
sister
created
an
uneasy
sensation
in
either
heart
which
absence
could
not
remove
when
our
hero
reported
himself
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
he
was
astonished
at
his
expressing
a
total
ignorance
of
his
belonging
to
her
and
sent
down
for
the
clerk
to
know
if
his
name
was
on
the
books
the
clerk
a
spare
personage
remarkably
spruce
and
neat
in
his
attire
and
apparently
about
forty
years
of
age
made
his
appearance
with
the
open
list
under
his
arm
and
with
a
humble
bow
to
the
laid
it
upon
the
and
running
over
several
pages
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
with
his
finger
at
last
discovered
our
hero
name
it
all
right
young
gentleman
said
the
take
him
down
to
the
berth
mr
skrimmage
and
introduce
him
you
brought
your
hammock
of
course
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
your
chest
has
a
good
lock
upon
it
if
not
i
can
tell
you
you
not
find
all
your
clothes
tally
with
your
division
list
by
morning
but
we
can
not
help
these
things
here
we
are
but
a
sort
of
a
and
every
man
must
take
care
of
himself
seymour
thanked
the
for
his
caution
and
descended
with
the
clerk
who
requested
him
to
step
into
his
private
cabin
previous
to
being
ushered
into
the
where
the
midshipmen
mess
was
held
and
of
which
mr
skrimmage
filled
the
important
post
of
caterer
mrs
skrimmage
my
dear
said
seymour
conductor
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
mr
seymour
the
lady
courtesied
with
great
affectation
and
an
air
of
condescension
and
requested
our
hero
to
take
a
chair
soon
after
which
mr
skrimmage
commenced
it
is
the
custom
my
dear
sir
in
this
ship
for
every
gentleman
who
joins
the
midshipmen
berth
to
put
down
one
guinea
as
entrance
money
after
which
the
subscription
is
restricted
to
the
sum
of
five
shillings
per
week
which
is
always
paid
in
advance
you
will
therefore
oblige
me
by
the
trifling
sum
of
shillings
previous
to
my
introducing
you
to
your
new
messmates
you
will
excuse
my
requesting
the
money
to
be
paid
now
which
i
assure
you
does
not
arise
from
any
doubt
of
your
honour
but
the
fact
is
being
the
only
member
of
the
mess
who
can
be
considered
as
stationary
the
unpleasant
duty
of
caterer
has
devolved
upon
me
and
i
have
lost
so
much
money
by
young
gentlemen
leaving
the
ship
in
a
hurry
and
forgetting
to
settle
their
accounts
that
it
has
now
become
a
rule
which
is
never
broken
through
as
soon
as
mr
skrimmage
had
finished
his
oration
which
he
delivered
in
the
softest
and
most
persuasive
manner
seymour
laid
down
the
sum
required
and
having
waited
at
the
clerk
request
to
see
his
name
and
sum
paid
entered
in
the
by
mrs
skrimmage
he
was
shown
into
the
which
he
found
crowded
with
between
thirty
and
forty
midshipmen
whose
vociferations
and
laughter
created
such
a
din
as
to
drown
the
voice
of
his
conductor
who
cried
out
mr
seymour
gentlemen
to
join
the
mess
and
then
quitted
the
noisy
abode
which
gave
our
hero
the
idea
of
bedlam
broke
loose
on
one
side
of
the
a
party
of
fifteen
or
twenty
were
seated
on
the
deck
in
a
circle
stripped
to
their
shirts
with
their
handkerchiefs
laid
up
like
ropes
in
their
hands
a
great
coat
and
a
which
they
had
borrowed
from
the
marine
tailor
who
was
working
on
the
lay
in
the
centre
and
they
pretended
to
be
at
work
with
their
needles
on
the
coat
it
was
the
game
of
goose
the
whole
amusement
of
which
consisted
in
giving
and
receiving
blows
every
person
in
the
circle
had
a
name
to
which
he
was
obliged
to
answer
immediately
when
it
was
called
in
default
of
which
he
was
severely
punished
by
all
the
rest
the
names
were
distinguished
by
colours
as
black
cap
red
cap
and
the
elegant
conversation
commenced
by
the
master
tailor
ran
as
follows
observing
that
it
was
carried
on
with
the
greatest
rapidity
of
utterance
that
a
false
stitch
whose
was
it
black
cap
no
sir
not
mine
sir
who
then
sir
red
cap
you
lie
sir
who
then
sir
blue
cap
blue

you
lie

who
then
sir
yellow

yellow
cap
yellow
cap
unfortunately
did
not
give
the
lie
in
time
for
which
he
was
severely
punished
and
the
game
then
continued
but
the
part
of
the
game
which
created
the
most
mirth
was
providing
a
goose
for
the
tailors
which
was
accomplished
by
some
of
their
confederates
throwing
into
the
circle
any
bystander
who
was
not
on
his
guard
and
who
immediately
that
he
was
thrown
in
was
thrashed
and
kicked
by
the
whole
circle
until
he
could
make
his
escape
an
attempt
of
this
kind
was
soon
made
upon
seymour
who
being
well
acquainted
with
the
game
and
perceiving
the
party
rushing
on
him
to
push
him
in
dropped
on
his
hands
and
knees
so
that
the
other
was
caught
in
his
own
trap
by
tumbling
over
seymour
into
the
circle
himself
from
which
he
at
last
escaped
as
much
mortified
by
the
laugh
raised
against
him
as
with
the
blows
which
he
had
received
seymour
who
was
ready
to
join
in
any
fun
applied
for
work
and
was
admitted
among
the
journeymen
what
your
name
dandy
grey
russet
cap
replied
seymour
selecting
a
colour
which
would
give
him
ample
time
for
answering
to
his
call
oh
i
be
damned
but
you
an
old
hand
observed
one
of
the
party
and
the
game
continued
with
as
much
noise
as
ever
but
we
must
leave
it
and
return
to
mr
skrimmage
who
was
a
singular
if
not
solitary
instance
of
a
person
in
one
of
the
lowest
grades
of
the
service
having
amassed
a
large
fortune
he
had
served
his
time
under
an
attorney
and
from
that
situation
why
or
wherefore
the
deponent
sayeth
not
shipped
on
board
a
in
the
capacity
of
a
ship
clerk
the
vessel
which
first
received
him
on
board
was
an
old
ship
of
two
decks
a
few
of
which
remained
in
the
service
at
that
time
although
they
have
long
been
dismissed
and
broken
up
being
a
dull
sailer
and
fit
for
nothing
else
she
was
constantly
employed
in
protecting
large
convoys
of
merchant
vessels
to
america
and
the
west
indies
although
other
occasionally
assisted
her
in
her
employ
the
captain
of
the
ship
from
long
standing
was
invariably
the
senior
officer
and
the
masters
of
the
merchant
vessels
were
obliged
to
go
on
board
his
ship
to
receive
their
convoy
instructions
and
a
distinguishing
pennant
which
is
always
given
without
any
fee
but
skrimmage
who
had
never
been
accustomed
to
deliver
up
any
paper
without
a
fee
when
he
was
in
his
former
profession
did
not
feel
inclined
to
do
so
in
his
present
make
a
direct
charge
he
dare
not
he
therefore
hit
upon
a
de
which
effected
his
purpose
he
borrowed
from
different
parties
seven
or
eight
guineas
and
when
the
masters
of
merchant
vessels
came
on
board
for
their
instructions
he
desired
them
to
be
shown
down
into
his
cabin
where
he
received
them
with
great
formality
and
very
nicely
dressed
the
guineas
were
spread
upon
the
desk
so
that
they
might
be
easily
reckoned
sit
down
captain
if
you
please
favour
me
with
your
name
and
that
of
your
ship
as
he
took
these
down
he
carelessly
observed
i
have
delivered
but
seven
copies
of
the
instructions
as
yet
the
captain
having
nothing
to
do
in
the
meantime
naturally
cast
his
eyes
round
the
cabin
and
was
attracted
by
the
guineas
the
number
of
which
exactly
tallied
with
the
number
of
instructions
delivered
it
naturally
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
the
clerk
perquisites
of
office
what
is
the
fee
sir
whatever
you
please
some
give
a
guinea
some
two
a
guinea
was
deposited
and
thus
with
his
mr
skrimmage
without
making
a
direct
charge
contrived
to
pocket
a
hundred
guineas
or
more
for
every
convoy
that
was
put
under
his
captain
charge
after
four
years
during
which
he
had
saved
a
considerable
sum
the
ship
was
declared
unserviceable
and
broken
up
and
mr
skrimmage
was
sent
on
board
of
the
where
his
ready
wit
immediately
pointed
out
to
him
the
advantages
which
might
be
reaped
by
permanently
belonging
to
her
as
clerk
of
the
ship
and
caterer
of
the
midshipmen
berth
after
serving
in
her
for
eight
years
he
was
offered
his
rank
as
purser
which
he
refused
upon
the
plea
of
being
a
married
man
and
preferring
poverty
with
mrs
s
to
rank
and
money
without
her
at
this
the
reader
will
not
be
astonished
when
he
is
acquainted
that
the
situation
which
he
held
was
by
his
dexterous
plans
rendered
so
lucrative
that
in
the
course
of
twelve
years
with
principal
and
accumulating
interest
he
had
amassed
the
sum
of
pounds
a
is
a
for
officers
and
men
until
they
are
enabled
to
join
or
are
drafted
to
their
respective
ships
the
consequence
is
that
an
incessant
change
is
taking
place
a
midshipman
sometimes
not
remaining
on
board
of
her
for
more
than
three
days
before
an
opportunity
offers
of
joining
his
ship
in
fact
when
we
state
that
during
the
war
upwards
of
one
thousand
midshipmen
were
received
and
sent
away
from
a
in
the
course
of
twelve
months
we
are
considerably
within
the
mark
now
as
mr
skrimmage
always
received
one
guinea
as
entrance
to
the
mess
and
a
week
subscription
in
advance
and
moreover
never
spent
even
the
latter
or
had
his
accounts
examined
it
is
easy
to
conceive
what
a
profitable
situation
he
had
created
for
himself
mrs
skrimmage
also
was
a
useful
helpmate
she
lived
on
board
at
little
expense
and
by
her
attention
to
the
dear
little
middies
and
their
wearing
apparel
who
were
sent
on
board
to
join
some
ship
for
the
first
time
added
very
considerably
to
his
profits
her
history
was
as
follows
it
had
three
eras
she
had
been
a
in
town
and
in
this
situation
acquiring
a
few
of
the
practices
of
high
life
she
had
become
something
else
on
the
town
and
finally
mrs
skrimmage
with
a
view
of
awing
his
unruly
associates
into
respect
mr
skrimmage
as
well
as
his
wife
was
particularly
nice
in
his
dress
and
his
conversation
and
affected
the
gentleman
as
she
did
the
lady
this
generally
answered
pretty
well
but
sometimes
unpleasant
circumstances
would
occur
to
which
his
interest
compelled
mr
skrimmage
to
submit
it
may
be
as
well
here
to
add
that
at
the
end
of
the
war
mr
skrimmage
applied
for
his
promotion
for
long
service
and
obtaining
it
added
his
purser
to
the
interest
of
his
accumulated
capital
and
retired
from
active
service
the
steward
and
his
boy
entering
the
with
two
enormous
black
put
an
end
to
the
boisterous
amusement
it
was
the
signal
for
tea
hurrah
for
scaldchops
cried
the
master
tailor
rising
from
the
game
which
was
now
abandoned
a
regiment
of
cups
and
saucers
lined
the
two
sides
of
the
long
table
and
a
general
scramble
ensued
for
seats
i
say
mr
cried
an
old
to
the
caterer
who
had
entered
shortly
after
the
and
assumed
his
place
at
the
end
of
the
table
what
sort
of
stuff
do
you
call
this
what
do
you
mean
to
imply
sir
replied
mr
skrimmage
with
a
pompous
air
mean
to
ply
why
i
mean
to
ply
that
there
damned
little
tea
in
this
here
water
why
i
seen
gin
as
dark
a
colour
as
this
steward
said
mr
skrimmage
turning
his
head
over
his
shoulder
towards
him
have
you
not
put
the
established
allowance
into
the
yes
sir
replied
the
steward
a
for
every
gentleman
and
one
for
coming
up
you
hear
gentlemen
said
mr
skrimmage
hear
yes
but
we
do
taste
i
should
like
to
see
it
sarved
out
continued
the
sir
replied
mr
skrimmage
i
must
take
the
liberty
to
observe
to
you
that
that
is
a
responsibility
never
intrusted
to
the
steward
the
established
allowance
is
always
portioned
out
by
mrs
skrimmage
herself
damn
mrs
skrimmage
said
a
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
what
cried
the
indignant
husband
what
did
i
hear
who
was
that
was
this
young
gentleman
mr
caterer
said
a
malicious
lad
pointing
to
one
opposite
me
sir
replied
the
youngster
recollecting
the
game
they
had
just
been
playing
you
lie
sir
who
then
sir
black
cap
black
cap
pointing
to
another
i
damn
mrs
skrimmage
you
lie
sir
who
then
sir
red
cap
red
cap
i
damn
mrs
skrimmage
you
lie
sir
and
thus
was
the
accusation
bandied
about
the
table
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
whole
party
except
the
caterer
who
regretted
having
taken
any
notice
of
what
had
been
said
really
gentlemen
this
behaviour
is
such
as
can
not
be
tolerated
observed
mr
skrimmage
who
invariably
preferred
the
in
as
caterer
of
this
berth
it
is
your
duty
to
give
us
something
to
eat
added
one
of
the
midshipmen
gentlemen
you
see
what
there
is
on
the
table
there
are
rules
and
regulations
laid
down
which
can
not
be
deviated
from
and
and
those
are
to
starve
us
i
paid
shillings
and
have
not
had
mouthfuls
in
the
three
days
that
i
have
been
here
i
should
like
to
see
your
accounts
mr
caterer
bravo
let
have
his
accounts
roared
out
several
of
the
party
gentlemen
my
accounts
are
ready
for
inspection
and
will
bear
i
will
venture
to
assert
the
most
minute
investigation
but
it
must
be
from
those
who
have
a
right
to
demand
it
and
i
can
not
consider
that
a
person
who
has
only
been
in
the
ship
for
three
days
has
any
pretence
to
examine
them
but
i
have
been
in
the
ship
three
weeks
said
another
and
have
paid
you
one
pound
sixteen
shillings
i
have
a
right
and
now
i
demand
them
so
let
us
have
the
accounts
on
the
table
since
we
can
get
nothing
else
the
accounts
the
accounts
were
now
vociferated
for
by
such
a
threatening
multitude
of
angry
voices
that
mr
skrimmage
turned
pale
with
alarm
and
thought
it
advisable
to
bend
to
the
threatening
storm
steward
present
the
gentlemen
respects
to
mrs
skrimmage
and
request
that
she
will
oblige
them
by
sending
in
the
mess
you
understand
the
gentlemen
respects
to
mrs
skrimmage
damn
mrs
skrimmage
again
cried
out
one
of
the
midshipmen
and
the
game
of
goose
was
renewed
with
the
phrase
until
the
steward
returned
with
the
book
mrs
skrimmage
compliments
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
mess
and
she
has
great
pleasure
in
complying
with
their
request
but
in
consequence
of
her
late
indisposition
the
accounts
are
not
made
up
further
than
to
the
end
of
last
month
this
was
the
plan
upon
which
the
wily
clerk
invariably
acted
as
it
put
an
end
to
all
inquiry
but
the
indignation
of
the
midshipmen
was
not
to
be
controlled
and
as
they
could
not
give
it
vent
in
one
way
they
did
in
another
gentlemen
said
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
fraternity
imitating
mr
skrimmage
style
i
must
request
that
you
will
be
pleased
not
to
kick
up
such
a
damned
row
because
i
wish
to
make
a
speech
and
i
request
that
two
of
you
will
be
pleased
to
stand
sentries
at
the
door
permitting
neither
ingress
nor
egress
that
i
may
my
yarn
without
interruption
gentlemen
we
have
paid
our
and
we
have
nothing
to
eat
we
have
asked
for
the
accounts
and
we
are
put
off
with
now
gentlemen
as
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
caterer
honour
i
propose
that
we
give
him
a
receipt
in
full
and
here
a
pen
to
write
it
with
cried
out
another
holding
up
the
with
which
they
had
been
playing
the
game
then
gentlemen
are
you
all
agreed
to
cobb
the
caterer
the
shouts
of
assent
frightened
mr
skrimmage
who
attempted
to
make
his
escape
by
the
door
but
was
prevented
by
the
two
sentries
who
had
been
placed
there
on
purpose
he
then
requested
to
be
heard
to
be
allowed
to
explain
but
it
was
useless
he
was
dragged
to
the
table
amidst
an
uproar
of
laughter
and
shouting
extreme
bad
headaches
mrs
skrimmage
nervous
ample
satisfaction
conduct
like
gentlemen
complain
to
were
the
unconnected
parts
of
his
expostulation
which
could
be
distinguished
he
was
extended
across
the
table
face
downwards
the
lapels
of
his
coat
thrown
up
and
two
dozen
blows
with
the
were
administered
with
such
force
that
his
shrieks
were
even
louder
than
the
laughter
and
vociferation
of
his
assailants
during
the
infliction
the
noise
within
was
so
great
that
they
did
not
pay
attention
to
that
which
was
outside
but
as
soon
as
mr
skrimmage
had
been
put
on
his
legs
again
and
the
tumult
had
partially
subsided
the
voice
of
the
requesting
admittance
and
the
screaming
of
mrs
skrimmage
were
heard
at
the
door
which
continued
locked
and
guarded
the
door
was
opened
and
in
flew
the
lady
my
skrimmage
my
skrimmage
what
have
the
brutes
been
doing
to
you
oh
the
wretches
continued
the
lady
panting
for
breath
and
turning
to
the
midshipmen
who
had
retreated
from
her
you
shall
all
be
turned
out
of
the
service
you
shall
that
you
shall
we
see
we
write
for
a
ay
you
may
laugh
but
we
will
contempt
to
a
superior
officer
clerk
and
caterer
indeed
the
service
has
come
to
a
pretty
pass
you
villains
you
may
grin
i
tear
the
eyes
out
of
some
of
you
that
i
will
come
mr
skrimmage
let
us
go
on
the
and
see
if
the
service
is
to
be
trifled
with
dirty
scum
indeed
and
the
lady
stopped
for
want
of

wishes
to
know
the
reason
why
you
are
making
such
a
noise
our
compliments
to
mr

wretches
cobb
her
cobb
her
roared
out
all
the
midshipmen
who
were
irritated
at
her
language
and
in
a
moment
she
was
seized
by
a
dozen
of
them
who
dragged
her
to
the
table
mrs
skrimmage
struggled
in
vain
and
there
appeared
every
chance
of
the
threat
being
put
in
force
oh
is
this
the
way
to
treat
a
lady
skrimmage
help
help
skrimmage
who
had
been
battered
almost
to
stupefaction
roused
by
the
call
of
his
frightened
wife
darted
to
her
and
throwing
his
arm
round
her
waist
spare
her
gentlemen
spare
her
for
mercy
sake
spare
her
or
continued
he
in
a
faltering
voice
if
you
will
cobb
her
let
it
be
the
appeal
in
favour
of
modesty
and
humanity
had
its
due
weight
and
mr
and
mrs
skrimmage
were
permitted
to
leave
the
without
further
molestation
the
lady
however
as
soon
as
she
had
obtained
the
outside
of
the
door
forgetting
her
assumed
gentility
turned
back
and
shaking
her
fist
at
her
persecutors
made
use
of
language
with
a
repetition
of
which
we
will
not
offend
our
readers
and
then
with
her
husband
quitted
the
skrimmage
compliments
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
mess
cried
one
of
the
midshipmen
mimicking
which
was
followed
by
a
roar
of
laughter
when
the
again
made
his
appearance
gentlemen
the
says
that
all
those
who
are
waiting
for
a
passage
round
to
plymouth
are
to
be
on
deck
with
their
traps
immediately
there
a
frigate
ordered
round
she
has
the
up
and
her
are
sheeted
home
this
put
an
end
to
further
mischief
as
there
were
at
least
twenty
of
them
whose
respective
ships
were
on
that
station
in
the
meantime
while
they
were
getting
ready
mr
skrimmage
having
restored
the
precision
of
his
apparel
proceeded
to
the
and
made
his
complaint
to
the
but
these
complaints
had
been
repeatedly
made
before
and
mr
phillips
was
tired
of
hearing
them
and
was
aware
that
he
deserved
his
fate
mr
skrimmage
was
therefore
silenced
with
the
usual
remark
how
can
i
punish
these
young
men
if
they
are
in
the
wrong
who
slip
through
my
fingers
immediately
the
parties
you
complain
of
are
now
going
down
the
side
do
you
give
up
the
but
this
for
the
reasons
before
stated
did
not
suit
mr
skrimmage
who
returned
below
for
a
day
or
two
the
mess
was
better
supplied
from
fear
of
a
repetition
of
the
dose
after
that
it
went
on
again
as
before
chapter
forty
one
all
desperate
hazards
courage
do
create
as
he
plays
frankly
who
has
least
estate
dryden
it
were
all
one
that
i
should
love
a
bright
particular
star
and
think
to
wed
it
shakespeare
seymour
was
soon
weary
of
the
endless
noise
and
confusion
to
which
he
was
subjected
on
board
of
the
and
he
wrote
to
captain
m
requesting
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
join
some
vessel
on
active
service
until
the
period
should
arrive
when
the
former
would
be
enabled
to
resume
the
command
of
his
ship
the
answer
from
his
patron
informed
him
that
the
time
of
his
renewal
of
his
professional
duties
would
be
uncertain
not
having
hitherto
derived
much
benefit
from
his
return
to
england
that
as
the
was
daily
expected
to
arrive
from
the
mission
on
which
she
had
been
despatched
and
would
then
remain
on
channel
service
ready
to
be
made
over
to
him
as
soon
as
his
health
should
be
he
would
procure
an
order
for
him
to
join
her
as
soon
as
she
arrived
he
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
would
be
more
comfortable
on
board
a
ship
in
which
he
had
many
old
messmates
and
friends
than
in
any
other
to
the
officers
of
which
he
would
be
a
perfect
stranger
that
in
the
meantime
he
had
procured
leave
of
absence
for
him
and
requested
that
he
would
pay
him
a
visit
at
his
cottage
near
richmond
to
the
vicinity
of
which
place
he
had
removed
by
the
advice
of
his
medical
attendants
seymour
gladly
availed
himself
of
this
opportunity
of
seeing
his
protector
and
after
a
sojourn
of
three
weeks
returned
to
portsmouth
to
join
the
which
had
for
some
days
been
lying
at
spithead
most
of
the
commissioned
and
many
of
the
junior
officers
who
had
served
in
the
west
indies
were
still
on
board
of
her
anxiously
waiting
for
the
return
of
captain
m
whose
value
as
a
commanding
officer
was
more
appreciated
for
the
change
which
had
taken
place
seymour
was
cordially
greeted
by
his
former
shipmates
not
only
for
his
own
sake
but
from
the
idea
that
his
having
rejoined
the
frigate
was
but
a
precursor
of
the
reappearance
of
captain
m
himself
there
is
perhaps
no
quality
in
man
partaking
of
such
variety
and
so
difficult
to
analyse
as
whether
it
be
physical
or
mental
both
of
which
are
not
only
innate
but
to
be
acquired
the
former
and
the
most
universal
is
most
capriciously
bestowed
sometimes
although
rarely
nature
has
denied
it
altogether
we
have
therefore
in
the
latter
instance
courage
nil
as
a
zero
courage
negative
halfway
up
and
courage
positive
at
the
top
which
may
be
considered
as
blood
heat
and
upon
this
thermometrical
scale
the
animal
courage
of
every
individual
may
be
placed
courage
or
cowardice
needs
no
explanation
courage
negative
which
is
the
most
common
is
that
degree
of
firmness
which
will
enable
a
person
to
do
his
duty
when
danger
to
he
will
not
avoid
danger
but
he
will
not
exactly
seek
it
courage
positive
when
implanted
in
a
man
will
induce
him
to
seek
danger
and
find
opportunities
of
distinguishing
himself
where
others
can
see
none
courage
negative
is
a
passive
feeling
and
requires
to
be
roused
courage
positive
is
an
active
and
restless
feeling
always
on
the
an
extreme
susceptibility
and
a
phlegmatic
indifference
of
disposition
although
diametrically
in
opposition
to
each
other
will
produce
the
same
results
in
the
former
it
is
mental
in
the
latter
animal
courage
paradoxical
as
it
may
appear
the
most
certain
and
most
valuable
description
of
is
that
which
is
acquired
from
the
of
further
there
is
no
talent
which
returns
more
fold
than
courage
when
constantly
in
exercise
for
habit
will
soon
raise
the
individual
whose
index
is
near
to
zero
to
the
degree
in
the
scale
opposite
to
courage
negative
and
the
possessor
of
courage
negative
will
rise
up
to
that
of
courage
positive
although
from
desuetude
they
again
sink
to
their
former
it
is
generally
considered
that
men
are
but
as
without
some
incentive
there
would
be
no
courage
i
doubt
the
position
i
should
rather
say
that
we
were
naturally
cowards
without
incitement
courage
of
every
description
would
gradually
descend
to
the
zero
of
the
scale
the
necessity
of
some
incentive
to
produce
it
proves
that
it
is
against
nature
as
the
ferocity
of
brutes
is
occasioned
by
hunger
so
is
that
of
man
by
hungering
after
the
coveted
enjoyments
of
life
and
in
proportion
as
this
appetite
is
appeased
so
is
his
courage
decreased
if
you
wish
animals
to
fight
they
must
not
be
and
if
a
nation
wishes
to
have
good
officers
it
must
swell
their
pride
by
decorations
and
keep
them
poor
there
are
few
who
do
not
recollect
the
answer
of
the
soldier
to
his
general
who
had
presented
him
with
a
purse
of
gold
in
reward
of
a
remarkable
instance
of
gallantry
and
who
a
short
time
afterwards
requiring
something
extremely
hazardous
to
be
attempted
sent
for
the
man
and
expressed
his
wish
that
he
would
volunteer
general
said
he
send
a
man
who
has
not
got
a
purse
of
gold
the
strongest
incitement
to
courage
is
withdrawn
by
the
possession
of
wealth
other
worldly
possessions
also
affect
it
lord
vincent
when
he
heard
that
any
captain
had
married
used
to
observe
emphatically
that
he
was
damned
for
the
service
no
compliment
to
the
officer
but
a
very
handsome
one
to
the
sex
as
it
implied
that
their
attractions
were
so
great
that
we
could
not
disengage
ourselves
from
our
thraldom
or
in
fact
that
there
were
no
such
things
as
bad
or
scolding
wives
finally
this
which
is
considered
as
a
and
to
entitle
us
to
the
rewards
bestowed
upon
it
by
the
fair
sex
who
value
it
above
all
others
is
so
wholly
out
of
our
control
that
when
suffering
under
sickness
or
disease
it
deserts
us
nay
for
the
time
being
a
violent
will
turn
a
hero
into
a
poltroon
so
much
for
a
dissertation
on
courage
which
i
should
not
have
ventured
to
force
upon
the
reader
had
it
not
been
to
prepare
him
for
the
character
which
i
am
about
to
introduce
and
when
it
is
pointed
out
how
many
thousands
of
officers
were
employed
during
the
last
war
i
trust
it
will
not
be
considered
an
imputation
upon
the
service
by
asserting
that
there
were
some
few
who
their
the
acting
captain
of
the
during
the
early
part
of
his
career
in
the
service
had
there
been
such
a
thermometer
as
i
have
described
by
which
the
heat
of
temperament
in
the
party
would
have
been
precisely
ascertained
on
placing
its
bulb
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
would
have
forced
the
mercury
something
between
the
zero
and
courage
negative
towards
the
zero
more
yes
than
no
as
the
italian
said
but
now
that
he
was
a
married
man
above
fifty
years
of
age
with
a
large
family
he
had
descended
in
the
scale
to
the
absolute
zero
it
may
then
be
inquired
why
he
requested
to
be
employed
during
the
war
because
he
liked
full
pay
and
when
it
could
be
obtained
without
risk
and
because
his
wife
and
family
were
living
on
shore
in
a
very
snug
little
cottage
at
ryde
in
the
isle
of
wight
which
cottage
required
nothing
but
furniture
and
a
few
other
trifles
to
render
it
complete
marriage
had
not
only
subtracted
from
the
courage
of
this
worthy
officer
but
moreover
a
little
from
his
honesty
captain
capperbar
for
such
was
his
name
should
have
been
brought
up
as
a
missionary
for
he
could
anything
and
more
profusely
than
any
bible
society
the
name
by
which
he
had
christened
his
domicile
was
probably
given
as
a
sort
of
salvo
to
his
conscience
he
called
it
the
and
when
he
signed
his
name
to
the
expense
books
of
the
different
warrant
officers
without
specifying
the
exact
use
to
which
the
materials
were
applied
the
larger
proportions
were
invariably
expended
by
the
general
term
for
use
he
came
into
harbour
as
often
as
he
could
always
had
a
demand
for
stores
to
complete
and
a
defect
or
two
for
the
dockyard
to
make
good
and
the
admiral
who
was
aware
of
mr
capperbar
being
a
near
resident
made
every
reasonable
allowance
for
his
partiality
to
spithead
but
we
had
better
introduce
the
captain
sitting
at
his
table
in
the
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
in
port
the
carpenter
having
obeyed
his
summons
well
mr
cheeks
what
are
the
carpenters
about
weston
and
smallbridge

going
on
with
the
chairs

whole
of
them
will
be
finished
tomorrow
well
smith

about
the
chest
of
drawers

has
finished
the
of
the
sir

is
now
about
a
little
job
for
the
a
job
for
the
sir
how
often
have
i
told
you
mr
cheeks
that
the
carpenters
are
not
to
be
employed
except
on
duty
without
my
special
permission
his
standing
is
broke
sir
he
is
only
getting
out
a
chock
or
two
mr
cheeks
you
have
disobeyed
my
most
positive
by
the
bye
sir
i
understand
you
were
not
sober
last
night
please
your
honour
replied
the
carpenter
i
was
drunk
i
was
only
a
little
fresh
take
you
care
mr
cheeks
well
now
what
are
the
rest
of
your
crew
about
why
thompson
and
waters
are
cutting
out
the
pales
for
the
garden
out
of
the
i
saved
the
heel
to
return
very
well
but
there
wo
be
enough
will
there
no
sir
it
will
take
a
to
finish
the
whole
then
we
must
expend
one
when
we
go
out
again
we
can
carry
away
a
topmast
and
make
a
new
one
out
of
the
at
sea
in
the
meantime
if
the
sawyers
have
nothing
to
do
they
may
as
well
cut

palings
at
once
and
now
let
me
see

attics

but
my
lady
capperbar

to
about
ship

by
this
time
to
be
aware
that
we
are
only
allowed
three
colours
she
may
choose
or
mix
them
as
she
pleases
but
as
for
going
to
the
expense
of
buying
paint
i
ca
afford
it
what
are
the
rest
of
the
men
about
repairing
the
second
cutter
and
making
a
new
mast
for
the
pinnace
by
the
bye
that
puts
me
in
mind
of
it
have
you
expended

masts
only

one

away

then
you
must
expend
two
more
mrs
c

departed
to
execute
his
variety
of
commissions
the
present
of
the
who
upon
the
promotion
of
the
former
had
been
selected
by
captain
m
previous
to
his
quitting
the
ship
was
an
excellent
officer
and
a
pleasant
messmate
very
superior
in
talent
and
information
to
the
many
the
conduct
of
captain
capperbar
was
a
source
of
annoyance
to
him
as
he
frequently
could
not
command
the
services
of
the
different
artificers
when
they
were
required
for
the
ship
he
had
however
been
long
enough
in
the
service
to
be
aware
that
it
was
better
to
make
the
best
of
it
than
to
create
enemies
by
impeaching
the
conduct
of
his
superior
officer
as
the
command
of
captain
capperbar
was
but
temporary
he
allowed
him
to
proceed
without
expostulation
contenting
himself
with
turning
his
conduct
into
a
source
of
conversation
and
amusement
well
prose
how
do
you
like
the
new
skipper
inquired
seymour
soon
after
his
arrival
on
board
why
i
do
declare
i
can
hardly
tell
he
a
very
man
but
he
do
exactly
treat
us
midshipmen
as
if
we
were
officers
or
gentlemen
and
as
for
his
wife
she
is
really
too
bad
i
am
sent
every
day
on
shore
to
the
cottage
because
i
belong
to
the
captain
gig
they
never
ask
me
to
sit
down
but
set
me
to
work
somehow
or
another
the
other
day
he
had
a
boat
crew
on
shore
digging
up
a
piece
of
ground
for
planting
potatoes
and
he
first
showed
me
how
to
cut
the
and
then
gave
me
a
knife
and
ordered
me
to
the
whole
which
lay
in
the
field
and
to
see
that
the
men
worked
properly
at
the
same
time
i
never
cut
potatoes
into
little
bits
before
except
at
table
after
they
were
boiled
well
that
was
too
bad
but
however
you
know
how
to
plant
potatoes
in
future
there
nothing
like
knowledge
and
then
he
sends
the
nurse
and
children
for
an
airing
as
he
calls
it
on
the
water
and
i
am
obliged
to
take
them
i
do
like
pulling
about
that
quite
a
matter
of
taste
prose
some
midshipmen
do
what
do
you
think
mrs
capperbar
asked
me
to
do
the
other
day
i
sure
i
ca
guess
why
to
shell
peas
well
did
you
oblige
her
why
yes
i
did
but
i
did
not
like
it
and
the
other
day
the
captain
sent
me
out
to
walk
with
the
nurse
and
children
that
i
might
carry
master
henry
if
he
was
tired
they
have
observed
the
versatility
of
your
genius
she
made
me
hunt
the
hedges
for
a
whole
morning
after
eggs
because
she
was
convinced
that
one
of
the
hens
laid
astray
did
you
find
any
no
and
when
i
came
back
to
tell
her
so
she
got
into
a
rage
and
threatened
to
make
the
captain
flog
me
the
devil
she
did
a
devil
she
is
continued
prose
she
runs
about
the
house
capperbar
this
capperbar
that
will
will
not
insist
am
determined
but
continued
prose
as
you
belonged
to
the
captain
gig
before
you
will
of
course
take
her
again
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
give
the
charge
up
to
you
not
for
the
world
my
dear
prose
what
may
insure
your
promotion
would
be
my
ruin
i
never
nursed
a
child
or
shelled
a
pea
in
my
life
the
first
i
should
certainly
let
fall
and
the
second
i
probably
should
eat
for
my
trouble
so
pray
continue
at
your
post
of
honour
and
i
will
go
for
the
fresh
beef
every
morning
as
you
were
accustomed
to
do
when
we
we
were
last
in
port
captain
m
did
not
receive
the
immediate
benefit
which
he
had
anticipated
from
a
return
to
his
native
land
bath
cheltenham
devonshire
and
other
places
were
recommended
one
after
the
other
by
the
physicians
until
he
was
tired
of
moving
from
place
to
place
it
was
nearly
two
years
before
he
felt
his
health
sufficiently
to
resume
the
command
of
the
during
which
period
the
patience
of
officers
was
nearly
exhausted
and
not
only
was
all
the
furniture
and
fitting
up
of
the
cottage
complete
but
captain
capperbar
had
provided
himself
with
a
considerable
stock
of
materials
for
repairs
and
alterations
at
last
a
letter
from
the
captain
to
macallan
gave
the
welcome
intelligence
that
he
was
to
be
down
at
portsmouth
in
a
few
days
and
that
the
ship
was
ordered
to
fit
for
foreign
service
we
must
not
omit
to
mention
here
that
during
these
two
years
seymour
had
been
able
to
procure
frequent
leave
of
absence
which
was
invariably
passed
at
the
mcelvinas
and
that
the
terms
of
intimacy
on
which
he
was
received
at
the
hall
and
his
constant
intercourse
with
emily
produced
an
effect
which
a
more
careful
mother
would
have
guarded
against
the
youth
of
eighteen
and
the
girl
of
sixteen
had
feelings
very
different
from
those
which
had
actuated
them
on
their
first
acquaintance
and
seymour
who
was
staying
at
the
mcelvinas
when
the
expected
arrival
of
captain
m
was
announced
now
felt
what
pain
it
would
be
to
part
with
emily
the
intelligence
was
communicated
in
a
letter
from
prose
when
he
was
sitting
alone
with
mcelvina
and
the
bare
idea
of
separation
struck
him
to
the
heart
mcelvina
who
had
often
expressed
his
opinion
on
the
subject
to
his
wife
had
been
anxious
that
our
hero
should
be
sent
on
a
foreign
station
before
he
had
allowed
a
passion
to
take
so
deep
a
root
in
his
heart
that
to
eradicate
it
would
be
a
task
of
great
effort
and
greater
pain
aware
from
the
flushed
face
of
seymour
of
what
was
passing
within
he
quietly
introduced
the
subject
by
observing
that
in
all
probability
his
favourite
emily
would
be
married
previous
to
his
return
pointing
out
that
an
heiress
of
so
large
a
property
would
have
a
right
to
expect
to
unite
herself
with
one
in
the
highest
rank
of
society
seymour
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
as
he
leant
over
the
table
he
had
no
secrets
from
mcelvina
and
acknowledged
the
truth
of
the
observation
i
have
brought
up
the
subject
my
dear
boy
continued
mcelvina
because
i
have
not
been
blind
and
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
cherish
a
feeling
which
can
only
end
in
disappointment
she
is
a
sweet
girl
but
you
must
if
possible
forget
her
reflect
a
moment
you
are
an
orphan
without
money
and
without
family
although
not
without
friends
which
you
have
secured
by
your
own
merit
and
you
have
only
your
courage
and
your
abilities
to
advance
you
in
the
service
can
it
then
be
expected
that
her
parents
would
consent
to
an
union
or
would
it
be
honourable
in
you
to
take
any
advantage
of
her
youthful
prepossession
in
your
favour
and
prevent
her
from
reaping
those
advantages
that
her
fortune
and
family
entitle
her
to
seymour
felt
bitterly
the
justice
of
the
remark
a
few
tears
trickled
through
his
fingers
but
his
mind
was
resolved
he
had
thought
to
have
declared
his
love
before
his
departure
and
have
obtained
an
acknowledgment
on
her
part
but
he
now
made
a
firm
resolution
to
avoid
and
to
forget
her
i
shall
follow
your
advice
my
dear
sir
for
it
is
that
of
a
friend
who
is
careful
of
my
honour
but
if
you
knew
the
state
of
mind
that
i
am
in
how
foolish
and
inconsiderate
have
i
been
i
will
not
see
her
again
nay
that
would
be
acting
wrongly
it
would
be
quite
unpardonable
after
the
kindness
which
you
have
received
from
mrs
rainscourt
not
to
call
and
wish
them
farewell
you
must
do
it
seymour
it
will
be
an
exertion
i
acknowledge
but
if
i
mistake
not
his
character
not
too
great
a
one
for
william
seymour
good
night
my
dear
boy
on
the
ensuing
morning
seymour
who
had
fortified
himself
in
his
good
resolutions
walked
to
the
hall
to
announce
his
approaching
departure
on
foreign
service
and
to
take
his
farewell
his
last
farewell
of
emily
he
found
the
carriage
at
the
door
and
mrs
rainscourt
in
her
pelisse
and
bonnet
about
to
pay
a
visit
at
some
distance
she
was
sorry
at
the
information
for
seymour
was
a
great
favourite
and
delayed
her
departure
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
converse
with
him
at
the
end
of
which
emily
who
had
been
walking
came
into
the
library
communicating
the
intelligence
to
her
daughter
mrs
rainscourt
then
bade
him
farewell
and
expressing
many
wishes
for
his
health
and
happiness
was
handed
by
him
into
the
carriage
and
drove
off
leaving
seymour
to
return
to
the
library
and
find
himself
the
very
position
he
had
wished
to
avoid
alone
with
emily
emily
rainscourt
was
at
this
period
little
more
than
sixteen
years
old
but
it
is
well
known
that
in
some
families
as
in
some
countries
the
advance
to
maturity
is
much
more
rapid
than
in
others
such
was
the
case
with
our
heroine
who
from
her
appearance
was
generally
supposed
to
be
at
least
two
years
older
than
she
really
was
and
in
her
mind
she
was
even
more
advanced
than
in
her
person
seymour
returned
to
the
library
where
he
found
emily
upon
the
sofa
her
bonnet
had
been
thrown
off
and
the
tears
that
were
coursing
down
her
cheeks
were
hastily
brushed
away
at
his
entrance
he
perceived
it
and
felt
his
case
to
be
still
more
embarrassing
when
do
you
go
william
said
emily
first
breaking
silence
morning
i
have
called
to
return
my
thanks
to
your
mother
and
to
you
for
your
kindness
to
me
i
shall
ever
remember
it
with
gratitude
emily
made
no
answer
but
a
deep
sigh
escaped
i
shall
continued
seymour
be
away
perhaps
for
years
and
it
is
doubtful
if
ever
we
meet
again
our
tracks
in
life
are
widely
different
i
am
an
orphan
without
name
or
connection
or
even
home
except
through
the
kindness
of
my
friends
they
were
right
when
in
my
childhood
they
christened
me
the
own
for
i
belong
to
nobody
else
you
miss
rainscourt
emily
started
for
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
called
her
so
after
the
first
week
of
their
acquaintance
with
every
advantage
which
this
world
can
afford
will
soon
be
called
into
society
in
which
i
never
can
have
any
pretence
to
enter
you
will
in
all
probability
form
a
splendid
connection
before
if
ever
we
meet
again
you
have
my
prayers
and
shall
have
them
when
seas
divide
us
for
your
happiness
seymour
was
so
choked
by
his
feelings
that
he
could
say
no
more
and
emily
burst
into
tears
farewell
emily
god
in
heaven
bless
you
said
seymour
recovering
his
emily
who
could
not
speak
offered
her
hand
seymour
could
not
control
himself
he
pressed
her
lips
with
fervour
and
darted
out
of
the
room
emily
watched
him
until
he
disappeared
at
the
winding
of
the
avenue
and
then
sat
down
and
wept
bitterly
she
thought
that
he
was
unkind
when
he
ought
to
have
been
most
fond
on
the
eve
of
a
protracted
absence
he
might
have
stayed
a
little
longer
he
had
never
behaved
so
before
and
she
retired
to
her
room
with
her
heart
panting
with
anguish
and
disappointment
she
felt
how
much
she
loved
him
and
the
acknowledgment
was
embittered
by
the
idea
that
this
feeling
was
not
reciprocal
the
next
morning
when
the
hour
had
passed
at
which
seymour
had
stated
that
he
was
to
leave
the
spot
emily
bent
her
steps
to
the
cottage
that
she
might
by
conversation
with
her
friend
mrs
mcelvina
obtain
if
possible
some
clue
to
the
motives
which
had
induced
our
hero
to
behave
as
we
have
narrated
susan
was
equally
anxious
to
know
in
what
manner
seymour
had
conducted
himself
and
soon
obtained
from
emily
the
information
which
she
required
she
then
pointed
out
to
her
as
her
husband
had
done
to
seymour
the
improbability
if
not
impossibility
of
any
happy
result
to
their
intimacy
and
explained
the
honourable
motives
by
which
seymour
had
been
actuated
the
more
commendable
as
his
feelings
on
the
subject
were
even
more
acute
than
her
own
the
weeping
girl
felt
the
truth
of
her
remarks
as
far
as
the
justification
of
seymour
was
attempted
satisfied
with
the
knowledge
that
he
loved
her
she
paid
little
attention
to
the
more
prudent
part
of
the
advice
and
made
a
resolution
in
his
favour
which
as
well
as
her
attachment
unlike
most
others
formed
during
the
freshness
of
the
heart

time
and
circumstance

opened
his
sealed
orders
and
found
that
he
was
directed
to
proceed
forthwith
to
the
east
indies
he
had
been
prepared
for
this
by
indirect
hints
given
to
him
by
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
there
is
nothing
so
tedious
as
making
a
passage
and
of
all
others
that
to
the
east
indies
is
the
most
disagreeable
especially
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
when
sir
popham
had
not
added
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
the
colonial
grandeur
of
the
country
so
that
in
fact
there
was
no
for
the
wanderer
tired
with
the
unvarying
monotony
of
sky
and
water
we
shall
therefore
content
ourselves
with
stating
that
at
the
end
of
three
months
his
majesty
ship
dropped
her
anchor
in
kedgeree
roads
and
the
captain
of
the
same
pilot
schooner
who
had
taken
charge
of
her
off
the
was
put
in
requisition
to
convey
captain
m
and
his
despatches
up
to
calcutta
courtenay
macallan
and
seymour
were
invited
to
be
of
the
party
and
the
next
morning
they
shifted
on
board
the
pilot
schooner
and
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
magnificent
and
rapid
hoogly
the
pilot
captain
who
like
all
those
who
ply
in
this
dangerous
and
intricate
navigation
had
been
brought
up
to
it
from
his
youth
was
a
tall
gaunt
personage
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
and
familiar
in
his
manner
whether
he
had
found
some
difficulty
in
keeping
in
check
the
passengers
from
the
indiamen
whom
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
up
to
calcutta
whose
spirits
were
in
all
probability
rather
buoyant
upon
their
first
release
from
the
confinement
of
a
tedious
passage
or
whether
from
a
disposition
naturally
afraid
of
encroachment
he
was
incessantly
informing
you
that
he
was
captain
of
his
own
ship
although
in
all
other
parts
he
was
polite
yet
upon
this
he
paid
no
respect
to
persons
as
the
and
his
staff
much
to
their
amusement
and
occasionally
to
their
annoyance
found
to
be
the
case
when
they
ascended
the
river
under
his
charge
happy
to
see
you
on
board
captain
m
hope
you
will
make
yourself
comfortable
and
call
for
everything
you
want
boy
take
this
trunk
down
into
the
state
cabin
happy
to
see
you
gentlemen
and
beg
you
will
consider
yourselves
quite
at
home
at
the
same
time
beg
to
observe
that
i
of
my
own
so
you
ought
to
be
replied
captain
m
smiling
if
your
ship
was
no
larger
than
a
nutshell
i
captain
of
own
ship
i
can
assure
you
very
glad
we
agree
upon
that
point
captain
m
young
gentleman
continued
he
addressing
himself
to
courtenay
you
oblige
me
by
not
coming
to
an
anchor
on
my
if
you
wish
to
sit
down
you
can
call
for
a
chair
rather
annoying
muttered
courtenay
who
did
not
much
like
being
called
young
gentleman
a
chair
for
the
young
gentleman
continued
the
captain
of
the
schooner
starboard
a
little
mr
jones
there
is
rather
too
much
cable
out
till
the
tide
makes
stronger
i
presume
you
are
not
used
to
captain
it
a
very
pretty
thing
as
you
will
acknowledge
starboard
yet
give
her
the
helm
quick
mr
thompson
why
sir
do
you
know
that
i
was
once
very
nearly
on
shore
on
the
tail
of
this
very
bank
because
a
young
lady
who
was
going
up
to
calcutta
would
take
the
helm
the
mate
could
not
prevent
her
she
refused
to
let
it
go
and
when
i
commanded
her
told
me
with
a
laugh
that
she
could
steer
as
well
as
i
could
i
was
obliged
to
prove
to
her
in
rather
an
unpleasant
manner
that
i
was
captain
of
my
own
ship
why
you
did
not
flog
her
did
you
captain
why
no
not
exactly
that
but
i
was
obliged
to
jerk
the
wheel
round
so
quick
that
i
sprained
both
her
wrists
before
she
had
time
to
let
it
go
it
very
near
produced
a
mutiny
the
girl
fainted
or
pretended
to
do
so
and
all
the
gentlemen
passengers
were
in
high
wrath
little
thinking
the
fools
that
i
had
saved
their
lives
by
what
they
called
my
barbarity
however
i
told
them
as
soon
as
the
danger
was
over
that
i
was
captain
of
my
own
ship
sweet
pretty
girl
too
she
was
we
were
within
an
inch
of
the
bank
the
tide
running
like
a
sluice
and
should
have
turned
the
turtle
the
moment
that
we
had
struck
such
a
thing
as
carrying
politeness
too
far
if
i
had
not
twisted
the
wheel
out
of
her
hands
as
i
did
in
two
minutes
more
the
alligators
would
have
divided
her
pretty
carcase
and
all
the
rest
of
us
to
boot
no
occasion
for
that
captain
m
there
plenty
of
black
fellows
for
them
floating
up
and
down
all
day
long
as
you
will
see
they
throw
all
their
dead
into
the
river
do
they
not
all
sir
this
is
a
continuation
of
the
sacred
river
the
ganges
and
they
believe
that
it
insures
their
going
to
heaven
have
you
never
been
in
india
before
never
nor
these
three
gentlemen
neither
of
them
oh
then
cried
the
captain
his
face
brightening
up
at
the
intelligence
as
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
amusing
his
passengers
then
perhaps
you
would
not
object
to
my
explaining
things
to
you
as
we
go
along
on
the
contrary
we
shall
feel
much
indebted
to
you
observe
said
the
captain
looking
round
as
if
to
find
an
object
to
decide
him
where
to
begin
do
you
see
that
body
floating
down
the
river
with
the
crow
perched
upon
it
and
that
black
thing
flush
with
the
water
edge
which
nears
it
so
fast
that
the
head
of
an
alligator
he
is
in
chase
of
it
the
party
directed
their
attention
to
the
object
the
alligator
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
piece
of
black
wood
floating
down
the
stream
closed
with
the
body
his
upper
jaw
rose
clear
out
of
the
water
and
descended
upon
his
prey
with
which
he
immediately
disappeared
under
the
muddy
water
by
the
lord
mr
crow
but
you
a
narrow
chance
then
observed
the
captain
you
may
thank
your
stars
that
you
did
not
lose
your
life
as
well
as
your
breakfast
do
you
think
so
young
gentleman
continued
the
captain
addressing
courtenay
i
think
observed
courtenay
that
mr
crow
was
not
exactly
captain
of
his
own
ship
very
true
sir
that
point
of
land
which
we
are
just
shutting
in
captain
m
is
the
end
of
saugor
island
famous
for
bengal
tigers
and
more
famous
once
for
the
sacrifice
of
children
you
have
heard
of
it
i
have
heard
of
it
but
if
you
have
ever
witnessed
the
scene
i
shall
be
obliged
by
your
narration
i
did
once
captain
m
but
nothing
would
ever
induce
me
to
witness
it
again
i
am
very
glad
that
government
has
put
a
stop
to
it
by
force
you
are
aware
that
the
custom
arose
from
the
natives
attempting
to
avert
any
present
or
anticipated
calamity
by
devoting
a
child
to
propitiate
the
deity
on
a
certain
day
they
all
assembled
in
boats
with
their
victims
attended
by
their
priests
and
music
and
decorated
with
flowers
the
gaiety
of
the
procession
would
have
induced
you
to
imagine
that
it
was
some
joyous
festival
instead
of
a
scene
of
superstition
and
of
blood
it
would
almost
have
appeared
as
if
the
alligators
and
sharks
were
aware
of
the
exact
time
and
place
from
the
numbers
that
were
collected
at
the
spot
where
the
immolation
took
place
my
blood
curdles
now
when
i
think
of
it
the
cries
of
the
natives
the
shouting
and
encouraging
of
the
priests
the
deafening
noise
of
the
mixed
with
the
piercing
harsh
music
of
the
country
the
hurling
and
tossing
of
the
poor
little
infants
into
the
water
and
the
splashing
and
contention
of
the
ravenous
creatures
as
they
tore
them
limb
from
limb
within
a
few
feet
of
their
unnatural
parents
the
whole
sea
tinged
with
blood
and
strewed
with
flowers
the
very
remembrance
is
sickening
to
me
one
circumstance
occurred
more
horrid
than
all
the
rest
a
woman
had
devoted
her
child
but
she
had
the
feelings
of
a
mother
which
were
not
to
be
controlled
by
the
blindest
superstition
from
time
to
time
she
had
postponed
the
fulfilment
of
the
vow
until
the
child
had
grown
into
a
woman
for
she
was
thirteen
years
old
which
in
this
country
is
the
marriageable
age
misfortune
came
on
and
the
husband
was
told
by
the
priests
that
the
deity
was
offended
and
that
the
daughter
must
be
sacrificed
or
he
would
not
be
appeased
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
for
a
native
and
was
to
have
been
married
about
the
very
time
that
she
was
now
to
be
sacrificed
i
see
her
now
she
was
dark
in
complexion
as
they
all
are
but
her
features
were
beautifully
small
and
regular
and
her
form
was
perfect
symmetry
they
took
off
the
gold
ornaments
with
which
she
was
decorated
and
in
their
avarice
removed
her
garments
as
she
implored
and
entreated
on
her
knees
in
vain
the
boat
that
she
was
in
was
closer
to
the
shore
than
the
others
and
in
shallow
water
they
forced
her
over
the
gunwale
she
alighted
on
her
feet
the
water
being
up
to
her
middle
and
by
a
miracle
escaped
before
a
shark
or
alligator
could
reach
her
and
gained
the
beach
i
thought
that
she
was
saved
and
felt
more
happy
than
if
i
had
received
a
lakh
of
rupees
but
no
they
landed
from
the
boats
and
pushed
her
into
the
water
with
long
poles
while
she
screamed
for
pity
a
large
alligator
swam
up
to
her
and
she
fell
senseless
with
fright
just
before
he
received
her
in
his
jaws
so
i
do
think
the
poor
creature
suffered
much
after
that
although
the
agony
of
anticipation
must
have
been
worse
than
the
reality
that
one
instance
affected
me
more
than
the
scores
of
infants
that
were
sacrificed
to
moloch
distressing
as
the
narrative
was
there
was
a
novelty
and
interest
in
it
and
a
degree
of
feeling
unexpectedly
shown
by
the
captain
of
the
pilot
vessel
that
raised
him
in
the
opinion
of
captain
m
who
became
anxious
to
obtain
further
information
they
consider
the
river
as
sacred
do
you
imagine
that
they
consider
the
alligators
to
be
so
i
rather
think
that
they
do
sir
although
i
only
judge
from
what
i
have
seen
as
i
have
read
nothing
about
it
at
all
events
the
presence
of
an
alligator
will
not
prevent
them
from
performing
a
customary
duty
of
their
religion
which
is
bathing
in
the
sacred
river
the
people
come
down
to
bathe
at
the
different
ghauts
and
if
an
alligator
takes
one
of
them
down
it
will
not
prevent
the
others
from
returning
the
next
morning
even
if
one
was
to
be
taken
away
each
succeeding
day
i
rather
think
that
in
the
discharge
of
a
sacred
duty
they
consider
all
accidents
of
this
kind
as
according
to
the
will
of
the
deity
and
a
sort
of
passport
to
heaven
a
party
of
murderous
villains
turned
this
feeling
of
their
countrymen
to
good
account
at
a
ghaut
up
the
country
the
natives
had
bathed
there
for
centuries
without
any
accident
on
record
when
one
day
a
woman
disappeared
under
the
water
from
amongst
the
rest
and
every
day
for
many
weeks
the
same
untoward
circumstance
occurred
it
was
supposed
to
be
an
alligator
but
it
was
afterwards
ascertained
that
this
party
of
thieves
had
concealed
themselves
in
the
jungle
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
which
at
that
part
was
deep
but
not
very
wide
and
had
a
rope
with
a
hook
to
it
extended
under
water
to
the
ghaut
where
the
people
bathed
some
of
the
gang
mingled
with
the
bathers
and
slipping
down
under
water
made
the
rope
fast
to
the
legs
of
one
of
the
women
who
was
immediately
hauled
under
the
water
by
his
comrades
concealed
on
the
opposite
side
you
may
be
wondering
why
the
rascals
took
so
much
trouble
but
sir
the
women
of
this
country
especially
those
of
high
caste
and
who
are
rich
wear
massive
gold
bangles
upon
their
arms
and
legs
besides
ornaments
of
great
value
on
other
parts
of
their
person
and
they
never
take
them
off
when
they
bathe
as
they
are
fastened
on
so
as
not
to
be
removed
it
was
from
the
observation
that
this
supposed
alligator
was
very
nice
in
his
eating
as
he
invariably
took
away
a
brachmany
or
a
rajahpoot
girl
that
the
plot
was
discovered
we
are
now
abreast
of
the
diamond
harbour
a
sad
unhealthy
place
i
can
assure
you
port
a
little
mr
jones
give
five
or
six
fathoms
more
cable
we
drag
too
fast
this
is
a
very
dangerous
corner
that
we
are
turning
now
when
we
are
about
eight
miles
above
we
shall
bring
up
and
go
to
dinner
i
beg
your
pardon
young
gentleman
but
i
thank
you
to
leave
the
compasses
alone
you
excuse
me
but
i
command
this
vessel
the
pilot
schooner
rounded
the
point
in
safety
and
in
less
than
an
hour
brought
up
abreast
of
a
large
village
the
captain
stated
that
before
dinner
was
over
the
tide
would
be
too
slack
to
go
further
on
and
that
he
should
remain
there
during
the
ebb
and
not
weigh
till
early
the
next
morning
if
therefore
captain
m
and
the
gentlemen
felt
inclined
to
take
a
stroll
after
dinner
a
boat
was
at
their
service
this
was
gladly
assented
to
and
when
dinner
was
over
the
captain
of
the
schooner
ordered
the
boat
to
be
manned
and
at
the
request
of
captain
m
accompanied
them
on
shore
on
their
landing
the
flocking
together
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
noise
of
the
music
announced
that
something
more
than
usual
was
going
on
on
inquiry
the
pilot
captain
informed
them
that
the
rajah
of
the
village
who
had
ascended
the
river
to
perform
his
vows
at
some
distant
shrine
had
not
returned
at
the
time
that
he
was
expected
and
that
the
natives
were
afraid
that
some
accident
had
occurred
and
were
in
consequence
propitiating
the
deity
you
will
now
have
an
opportunity
of
beholding
a
very
uncommon
sight
which
is
the
propitiatory
dance
to
shivu
there
is
no
occasion
for
hurrying
on
so
fast
young
gentleman
continued
the
captain
to
courtenay
they
will
continue
it
till
midnight
how
excessively
annoying
that
of
his
own
ship
is
observed
courtenay
to
macallan
gentleman
as
if
he
could
not
see
my
epaulet
and
yet
there
is
nothing
particularly
to
be
affronted
about
you
a
very
youthful
appearance
and
surely
you
are
not
displeased
at
being
called
a
gentleman
why
no
but
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
annoyed
because
i
can
not
take
it
up
the
party
soon
arrived
at
the
site
of
the
performance
which
was
on
a
small
arena
at
the
foot
of
a
pagoda
the
pagoda
which
was
not
large
was
evidently
of
very
ancient
date
and
the
carvings
in
which
were
continued
round
on
its
sides
representing
processions
in
honour
of
the
deity
were
of
a
description
much
superior
to
the
general
execution
of
the
hindoos
the
summit
had
bowed
to
time
perishable
art
had
yielded
to
eternal
nature
a
small
tree
of
the
acacia
species
had
usurped
its
place
and
as
it
waved
its
graceful
bows
to
the
breeze
appeared
like
a
youthful
queen
reigning
over
and
protecting
the
various
shrubs
and
plants
which
luxuriated
in
the
different
crevices
of
the
building
the
dance
was
performed
by
about
fifteen
men
who
were
perfectly
naked
their
long
hair
falling
below
their
waists
they
went
through
a
variety
of
rapid
and
strange
evolutions
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
precision
throwing
about
their
hands
and
arms
and
distorting
their
bodies
even
to
their
fingers
in
a
dexterous
and
almost
terrific
manner
sometimes
they
would
suddenly
form
a
circle
and
with
a
simultaneous
jerk
of
their
heads
throw
their
long
hair
so
that
the
ends
would
for
a
moment
all
meet
together
in
the
centre
at
other
times
rolling
their
heads
upon
their
shoulders
with
such
astonishing
velocity
that
the
eye
was
dazzled
as
they
flew
round
and
round
their
hair
radiating
and
diverging
like
the
thrumbings
of
a
mop
when
trundled
by
some
housemaid
their
motions
were
regulated
by
the
while
an
old
brahmin
with
a
ragged
white
beard
sat
perched
over
the
door
of
the
pagoda
and
with
a
small
piece
of
bamboo
struck
upon
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
as
he
presided
over
the
whole
ceremony
after
a
few
minutes
of
violent
exertion
he
gave
the
signal
to
stop
and
the
performers
reeking
with
perspiration
from
every
pore
bound
up
their
wet
hair
over
their
foreheads
and
made
room
for
another
set
who
repeated
the
same
evolutions
is
this
religion
inquired
seymour
of
macallan
with
some
astonishment
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
in
a
few
words
we
must
hope
that
it
will
be
acceptable
as
such
for
its
votaries
are
at
least
sincere
oh
no
one
can
deny
the
of
their
devotion
observed
courtenay
drily
the
extreme
heat
and
effluvia
from
the
crowds
of
natives
who
witnessed
the
performance
forced
captain
m
and
his
companions
unwillingly
to
abandon
a
scene
so
novel
to
an
european
at
the
proposal
of
their
conductor
they
agreed
to
continue
their
walk
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
i
have
often
been
ashore
at
this
village
said
the
captain
for
they
make
the
small
mats
here
which
are
much
in
request
at
calcutta
and
i
have
frequent
commissions
for
them
i
can
show
you
a
novelty
if
you
wish
but
i
warn
you
that
it
will
not
be
a
very
agreeable
sight
the
nullah
that
runs
up
here
frequently
leaves
the
dead
bodies
on
the
bank
it
is
now
and
if
you
wish
to
be
introduced
to
vultures
and
jackals
i
can
show
you
plenty
but
prepare
yourself
for
a
disgusting
sight
for
these
animals
do
not
congregate
without
a
cause
to
prey
on
the
dead
bodies
i
presume
replied
captain
m
but
as
i
have
never
seen
these
animals
in
their
wild
state
my
curiosity
bears
down
any
anticipation
of
disgust
let
me
not
however
influence
those
who
do
not
feel
inclined
to
encounter
it
after
witnessing
that
dance
observed
courtenay
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
i
am
fully
prepared
for
it
is
impossible
to
be
more
disgusting
macallan
and
seymour
having
expressed
a
wish
to
proceed
the
pilot
captain
led
the
way
observing
these
animals
are
very
necessary
in
the
climates
to
which
they
are
indigenous
they
do
the
duty
on
shore
which
the
alligators
do
in
the
water
that
of
public
scavengers
the
number
of
bodies
that
are
launched
into
the
ganges
is
incredible
if
a
hindoo
is
sick
he
is
brought
down
to
the
banks
by
his
relatives
and
if
he
does
not
recover
is
thrown
into
the
river
it
is
said
indeed
that
if
they
are
known
to
have
money
their
relatives
do
not
wait
till
nature
tires
with
their
own
exertions
but
stop
their
mouths
with
clay
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
recovery
there
is
a
strong
eddy
round
this
point
and
the
bodies
are
swept
into
the
nullah
and
lie
dry
at
the
ebb
what
do
you
call
a
nullah
inquired
seymour
a
nullah
means
a
creek
i
was
so
stupidly
proud
that
i
did
not
like
to
ask
but
as
seymour
had
set
the
example
added
courtenay
pray
what
is
a
ghaut
a
see
there
are
some
vultures
perched
upon
that
tree
continued
the
pilot
captain
as
they
ascended
the
bank
of
the
nullah
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
top
they
perceived
to
their
horror
seven
or
eight
bodies
lying
in
the
mud
surrounded
by
vultures
and
jackals
who
indiscriminately
mingled
together
were
devouring
them
as
they
approached
the
jackals
retreated
looking
repeatedly
back
and
sometimes
facing
round
to
the
party
as
if
to
inquire
why
they
disturbed
them
in
their
repast
the
vultures
on
the
contrary
did
not
attempt
to
move
until
macallan
approached
to
within
a
few
feet
and
then
those
who
could
retired
a
few
yards
or
took
their
stations
on
the
low
branches
of
a
tree
close
by
where
others
who
were
already
satiated
were
sitting
with
drooping
wings
waiting
for
a
return
of
appetite
to
recommence
their
banquet
others
were
so
gorged
that
they
could
not
walk
away
with
their
wings
trailing
in
the
mud
and
their
beaks
separated
as
if
gasping
for
breath
their
brilliant
eye
dulled
from
repletion
there
they
remained
emitting
an
effluvium
so
offensive
that
the
numerous
skeletons
and
the
mingled
remains
of
mortality
were
pleasing
compared
to
such
disgusting
specimens
of
corruption
the
party
viewed
the
scene
for
a
minute
or
two
without
speaking
and
then
turned
away
by
common
consent
and
did
not
break
silence
until
they
had
left
it
far
behind
i
begin
to
think
said
courtenay
taking
out
his
box
that
even
a
savage
may
occasionally
have
an
excuse
for
taking
snuff
did
you
ever
in
your
whole
life
come
in
contact
with
such
a
stench
positively
it
has
impregnated
my
snuff
there
a
strong
twang
of
the
vulture
in
it
continued
he
emptying
the
contents
of
the
box
upon
the
ground
now
that
what
i
consider
cursedly
annoying
we
have
indeed
both
seen
and
heard
enough
for
one
day
observed
captain
m
as
they
entered
the
boat
many
thanks
to
you
mr
for
your
attention
to
our
wishes
not
at
all
captain
m
i
am
only
sorry
that
my
sights
have
not
been
as
agreeable
as
they
are
novel
but
when
you
arrive
at
calcutta
you
will
find
novelty
combined
with
pleasure
after
three
days
which
appeared
to
have
fled
with
extra
rapidity
from
the
constant
amusement
derived
from
the
anecdotes
and
information
imparted
by
the
pilot
captain
they
sailed
up
garden
reach
with
a
fine
breeze
and
the
city
of
palaces
the
only
one
that
deserves
its
name
burst
in
all
its
splendour
upon
their
sight
but
i
am
not
about
to
describe
it
reader
do
not
be
alarmed
it
is
not
in
my
province
as
a
and
i
make
it
a
rule
never
to
interfere
with
anybody
else
if
i
can
avoid
it
captain
hall
who
has
already
north
and
south
america
and
loo
choo
will
i
have
no
doubt
be
here
taking
africa
in
his
way
and
as
i
can
make
up
my
three
volumes
of
fiction
without
trespassing
upon
his
matter
of
fact
i
refer
you
to
his
work
when
it
appears
for
a
description
of
this
gorgeous
monument

painted
sepulchre

unwieldy
elephant

make
them
mirth
used
all
his
might
and
wreathed
his
lithe
proboscis
milton
captain
m
remained
but
a
few
days
at
calcutta
where
he
perceived
little
difference
between
the
society
and
that
of
england
remarking
only
that
the
gentlemen
were
more
hospitable
and
the
ladies
drank
more
beer
but
i
am
trespassing
notwithstanding
my
promise
to
the
contrary
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
i
will
therefore
be
off
at
once
before
i
am
decidedly
guilty
of
a
breach
of
faith
the
orders
were
to
join
the
admiral
who
had
quitted
the
bay
of
bengal
and
proceeded
to
bombay
to
avoid
the
monsoon
which
was
about
to
set
in
and
as
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
captain
m
did
not
touch
at
madras
but
made
all
possible
haste
to
gain
the
tranquil
side
of
the
peninsula
the
had
requested
that
he
would
call
at
travancore
to
deliver
a
letter
and
complimentary
present
to
the
reigning
queen
who
held
her
possessions
tributary
to
our
government
the
anchored
off
the
town
and
was
shortly
afterwards
boarded
by
one
of
the
ministers
of
the
queen
a
venerable
mussulman
who
brought
a
of
compliments
and
vegetables
he
was
accompanied
by
one
or
two
others
among
whom
was
a
very
indifferent
interpreter
captain
m
who
was
anxious
to
join
the
admiral
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
ill
health
from
delivering
the
present
and
letter
in
person
and
expressed
his
wish
to
the
deputy
that
he
would
take
them
in
charge
stating
that
his
services
were
required
elsewhere
he
requested
that
an
answer
to
the
letter
might
be
sent
on
board
as
soon
as
possible
this
was
explained
through
the
interpreter
and
captain
m
then
inquired
what
time
would
probably
elapse
before
the
answer
would
be
sent
the
reply
was
in
a
week
or
ten
days
ask
him
said
captain
m
whether
it
can
not
be
sent
morning
as
i
am
anxious
to
proceed
after
an
exchange
of
several
sentences
between
the
interpreter
and
the
deputy
who
observed
the
most
imperturbable
gravity
the
former
replied
to
captain
m
he
say
no
sar
little
people
like
you
and
me
write
letter
very
quick
all
in
one
minute
great
people
like
king
and
queen
not
possible
write
letter
less
than
week
or
ten
day
not
fashion
this
country
sar
the
presents
being
placed
in
the
boat
and
the
letter
presented
on
a
silver
salver
the
deputy
made
a
low
salaam
and
departed
captain
m
aware
that
all
attempts
to
hasten
them
would
be
useless
made
no
further
remarks
on
the
subject
the
next
morning
the
same
grave
personage
came
on
board
attended
by
the
interpreter
and
his
suite
with
many
compliments
from
their
royal
mistress
who
had
sent
a
present
for
the
captain
during
the
time
of
the
delivery
and
interpretation
of
the
message
the
natives
who
rowed
in
his
boat
handed
up
a
large
black
monkey
with
a
long
white
beard
extending
over
his
chin
and
shoulders
the
animal
who
did
not
seem
well
pleased
with
his
change
of
situation
and
who
was
naturally
of
a
vicious
temperament
flew
round
and
round
the
length
of
his
tether
catching
at
the
trousers
of
the
sailors
with
his
paws
and
teeth
and
using
the
latter
without
the
least
ceremony
queen
say
sar
many
compliments
and
tell
you
it
very
monkey
very
indeed
sar
very
fine
present
sar
it
may
be
observed
captain
m
to
the
but
i
wish
she
had
saved
herself
the
trouble
i
must
not
refuse
it
and
what
can
we
do
with
the
brute
it
will
amuse
the
men
sir
he
seems
to
have
plenty
of
devil
in
him
oh
roared
prose
i
do
declare
he
has
bit
a
piece
out
of
my
leg
high
caste
indeed
i
should
like
to
give
him
a
overboard
really
prose
that
not
so
bad
observed
seymour
jerry
was
correct
in
his
assertion
that
you
had
plenty
of
wit
only
it
required
strong
measures
to
extract
it
from
you
queen
say
sar
write
letter
in
five
or
six
days
and
say
suppose
captain
saib
and
officers
come
on
shore
order
everybody
go
hunt
tiger
queen
tell
people
make
everything
proper
very
fine
tiger
hunt
sar
captain
m
who
was
convinced
that
he
must
patiently
await
their
own
time
did
not
expostulate
at
the
delay
not
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
the
offer
he
requested
the
officers
would
consider
themselves
at
liberty
to
accept
the
invitation
which
was
intended
as
a
compliment
and
therefore
ought
not
to
be
refused
a
large
party
was
formed
who
on
the
ensuing
day
accompanied
by
the
deputy
and
his
suite
and
provided
with
and
muskets
landed
at
the
town
where
they
were
received
by
a
few
and
some
hundreds
of
spectators
on
their
arrival
at
a
house
which
had
been
prepared
for
their
reception
they
found
a
splendid
breakfast
awaiting
them
to
which
they
did
as
ample
justice
as
a
celebrated
traveller
to
that
which
welcomed
him
at
new
york
although
they
did
not
like
him
revel
to
satiety
by
plunging
into
oceans
of
tea
and
coffee
again
the
talents
of
the
interpreter
were
called
into
action
to
explain
the
reason
why
her
majesty
could
not
receive
them
which
he
did
by
laying
his
hand
across
what
medical
men
would
term
the
abdominal
region
or
as
mrs
ramsbottom
would
have
said
her
abominable
region
and
informing
them
that
the
queen
was
not
well
there
the
party
required
no
further
explanation
they
expressed
their
regrets
finished
their
breakfast
and
then
stated
themselves
ready
to
proceed
game
not
come
yet
sar
game
not
come
till
well
then
we
must
go
to
it
replied
courtenay
ah
gentleman
not
understand
shoot
in
this
country
continued
the
interpreter
who
then
with
some
difficulty
contrived
to
make
them
understand
that
about
four
thousand
men
had
been
summoned
to
drive
the
game
close
to
the
town
and
that
to
ensure
a
sufficiency
of
sport
the
sweep
which
they
had
taken
was
so
great
that
they
would
not
close
in
till
the
next
morning
he
added
that
as
perhaps
they
would
like
to
see
the
jungle
to
which
the
game
was
to
be
driven
horses
and
elephants
had
been
prepared
and
refreshments
would
be
provided
at
any
spot
where
they
might
wish
to
alight
macallan
who
had
provided
himself
with
his
hammers
and
other
implements
requisite
in
the
pursuit
of
his
favourite
sciences
mineralogy
and
geology
was
not
sorry
for
the
delay
and
the
remainder
of
the
party
were
satisfied
with
the
idea
of
a
pleasant
excursion
previous
to
their
setting
off
a
variety
of
performers
were
ordered
in
to
amuse
them
with
feats
of
juggling
and
address
which
would
have
been
acknowledged
if
seen
in
england
to
have
far
surpassed
those
of
the
celebrated
ramoo
samee
and
his
associates
amongst
the
rest
the
majestic
attitudes
of
the
dancing
snakes
particularly
attracted
the
attention
of
macallan
who
expressed
to
the
interpreter
his
wish
to
procure
one
of
the
species
the
famed
cobra
di
capella
with
the
fangs
not
extracted
the
interpreter
after
a
few
words
with
the
deputy
informed
the
doctor
with
his
usual
politeness
that
all
the
snakes
in
the
country
were
at
the
service
of
the
gentleman
but
take
care
not
let
bite
because
very
high
caste
snake
what
do
they
mean
by
calling
the
animals
of
the
country
high
caste
inquired
seymour
of
macallan
i
thought
it
was
a
term
only
applied
to
the
brachmins
and
rajahpoots
both
the
monkey
and
the
snake
are
indirectly
worshipped
by
these
people
replied
the
doctor
as
their
supposed
deities
are
represented
to
have
assumed
these
forms
the
more
vicious
or
the
more
venomous
the
higher
they
rank
the
cobra
di
capella
is
i
believe
the
most
venomous
serpent
that
exists
i
do
declare
that
that
monkey
deserves
his
rank
observed
prose
i
can
hardly
walk
as
it
is
well
but
you
can
ride
prose
and
here
are
the
horses
the
horses
with
three
elephants
two
with
howdahs
on
their
backs
and
the
other
loaded
with
a
large
tent
were
now
paraded
before
the
door
each
horse
was
attended
by
his
syce
or
groom
who
never
quitted
him
but
fanned
away
the
flies
with
a
chowry
or
whisk
formed
of
a
tail
they
were
beautiful
animals
but
much
too
spirited
for
some
of
the
party
who
felt
alarm
at
the
very
anticipation
of
the
difficulty
they
would
have
in
retaining
their
seats
prose
who
had
never
been
twice
in
his
life
on
the
back
of
any
animal
was
in
sad
trepidation
he
looked
first
at
the
horses
who
were
plunging
and
rearing
in
the
hands
of
the
syces
who
could
with
difficulty
restrain
their
impatience
and
then
at
the
elephants
whose
stupendous
size
flourishing
probosces
projecting
tusks
and
small
keen
eyes
equally
filled
him
with
dismay
i
do
declare
observed
prose
affecting
an
extra
limp
my
leg
is
very
bad
i
think
come
come
mr
prose
no
hauling
off
no
if
you
please
said
courtenay
who
with
seymour
was
already
mounted
upon
a
spirited
arabian
take
your
choice
but
go
you
must
well
then
if
i
must
which
would
you
advise
me
to
take

said
seymour
laughing
of
two
evils
always
choose
the
least
take
an
elephant
mr
prose
cried
courtenay
his
size
is
double
but
he
give
you
less
trouble
why
that
a
rhyme
i
do
declare
but
how

mr

very
much
obliged
to
you
for
a
ladder
a
ladder
was
brought
prose
and
macallan
with
his
implements
ascended
to
the
howdah
fixed
on
the
back
of
the
enormous
brute
the
remainder
of
the
party
being
ready
they
set
off
accompanied
by
the
deputy
the
interpreter
and
several
other
handsomely
attired
natives
who
out
of
compliment
to
the
officers
had
been
ordered
to
attend
them
the
country
like
most
parts
of
india
near
to
the
coast
consisted
of
paddy
or
rice
fields
under
water
diversified
with
intersecting
patches
of
jungle
and
high
trees
occasionally
they
passed
a
deeper
pool
where
the
buffaloes
with
only
their
horns
and
tips
of
their
noses
to
be
seen
lay
with
the
whole
of
their
enormous
carcasses
hid
under
the
muddy
water
to
defend
themselves
from
the
attacks
of
the
mosquitoes
and
the
powerful
rays
of
the
sun
look
at
the
buffaloes
prose
where
seymour
i
ca
see
any
i
never
saw
a
buffalo
in
my
life
it
like
an
ox
a
it
it
very
like
a
whale
replied
courtenay
at
this
moment
one
of
the
herd
startled
at
the
near
approach
of
the
cavalcade
rose
from
the
stagnant
pool
where
he
had
been
lying
and
presented
his
immense
carcass
covered
with
mud
to
prose
wondering
eyes
lord
molly
what
a
fish
exclaimed
courtenay
with
affected
surprise
alluding
to
an
old
standing
naval
joke
now
is
that
a
fish
cried
prose
a
little
alarmed
well
i
do
declare
i
say
mr
interpreter
what
is
that
thing
call
him
buffalo
sar
well
i
do
declare
i
always
thought
that
buffaloes
were
animals
that
lived
on
shore
nothing
like
travelling
mr
prose
observed
courtenay
you
know
a
buffalo
now
if
ever
you
happen
to
hook
one
when
you
are
fishing
out
of
the
and
you
remember
a
monkey
if
ever
you
meet
with
one
again
added
seymour
that
i
shall
all
the
days
of
my
life
the
country
as
they
proceeded
inland
materially
altered
its
features
forests
of
large
trees
and
fragments
of
rocks
met
their
view
instead
of
the
which
they
had
left
behind
and
macallan
now
wished
to
descend
that
he
might
collect
geological
specimens
explaining
his
reasons
he
desired
the
interpreter
to
order
the
elephant
to
stop
suppose
gentleman
want
stones
elephant
give
them
replied
the
interpreter
no
occasion
for
saib
to
get
off
and
explaining
the
doctor
wishes
to
the
conductor
of
the
elephant
the
knowledge
of
which
occasioned
a
laugh
among
the
natives
who
could
not
conceive
why
the
doctor
should
want
the
stones
he
continued
now
sar
you
point
any
stone
you
want
the
doctor
did
so
and
the
conductor
speaking
to
the
elephant
the
proboscis
of
the
sagacious
animal
immediately
handed
up
the
one
pointed
out
to
his
conductor
who
passed
it
to
macallan
for
more
than
an
hour
the
doctor
amused
himself
with
breaking
and
examining
the
different
specimens
presented
to
him
until
he
passed
by
an
isolated
mass
whose
component
parts
glittering
in
the
sun
made
him
anxious
to
obtain
a
specimen
it
was
a
large
rock
about
the
size
of
six
elephants
and
the
doctor
pointed
to
it
ah
sar
interrupted
the
interpreter
elephant
very
strong
beast
but
no
lift
that
i
did
not
imagine
that
he
would
but
i
must
dismount
to
examine
it
replied
macallan
gravely
who
was
absorbed
in
his
scientific
pursuits
the
elephant
stopped
and
the
doctor
not
aware
of
the
great
height
attempted
to
slip
down
his
side
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
ground
not
exactly
on
his
feet
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
party
regardless
of
trifles
when
in
pursuit
of
science
he
desired
prose
to
throw
him
down
his
bag
of
implements
and
proceeded
to
the
object
of
his
investigation
which
appeared
to
him
so
peculiar
that
he
requested
the
others
to
continue
their
excursion
and
leave
him
to
be
picked
up
on
their
return
ah
massa
like
stop
this
place
said
the
interpreter
yes
replied
the
doctor
do
you
really
intend
to
remain
here
inquired
courtenay
i
do
it
is
a
very
remarkable
specimen
of
and
i
must
procure
some
of
it
if
possible
well
i
do
declare
said
prose
i
thought
cinnamon
grew
upon
trees
doctor
i
should
like
to
stay
with
you
for
this
beast
does
shake
me
so
i
quite
sore
and
i
such
a
stitch
in
my
side
prose
accordingly
prepared
to
descend
and
was
recommended
by
the
interpreter
to
slide
down
by
the
hind
leg
of
the
animal
he
wo
kick
will
he
elephant
no
kick
sar
and
prose
descended
in
safety
while
the
remainder
of
the
party
continued
their
excursion
the
doctor
walked
several
times
round
the
rock
to
find
a
point
upon
which
he
would
be
able
to
make
some
impression
with
his
implements
but
the
fragment
which
had
probably
remained
there
since
the
deluge
without
having
been
honoured
by
a
visit
from
a
naturalist
was
worn
quite
smooth
by
time
and
presented
no
acute
angle
within
reach
upon
which
his
hammer
could
make
any
impression
nor
could
he
climb
it
for
it
rose
from
its
base
in
almost
a
perpendicular
line
the
more
he
scrutinised
the
more
anxious
was
he
to
obtain
specimens
and
he
determined
to
blast
the
rock
being
prepared
with
a
couple
of
short
crowbars
and
a
flask
of
gunpowder
he
fixed
upon
a
corner
which
appeared
more
assailable
than
the
rest
and
commenced
his
laborious
occupation
can
i
assist
you
mr
macallan
inquired
prose
you
can
indeed
mr
prose
now
observe
continue
driving
the
end
of
the
crowbar
straight
into
this
hole
until
you
have
made
it
about
nine
or
ten
inches
deep
that
will
be
sufficient
i
will
make
another
on
the
other
side
prose
commenced
his
labour
and
for
a
few
minutes
worked
with
due
emphasis
but
he
soon
found
out
that
he
had
volunteered
to
a
most
fatiguing
task
he
stopped
at
last
for
want
of
breath
well
mr
prose
inquired
the
doctor
from
the
other
side
of
the
rock
observing
that
he
had
ceased
from
his
labour
how
do
you
get
on
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
never
got
off
muttered
prose
for
this
is
worse
than
the
elephant
but
the
doctor
was
an
enthusiast
a
description
of
person
who
never
tires
and
he
judged
of
others
by
himself
how
far
have
you
got
now
mr
prose
oh
i
think
i
have
got
an
inch
and
a
half
good
answered
prose
quite
exhausted
no
more
exclaimed
macallan
why
you
must
work
harder
or
we
never
shall
blast
it
i
have
been
it
in
my
heart
thought
prose
for
these
last
ten
minutes
and
he
resumed
his
labour
you
know
nothing
of
mineralogy
inquired
the
doctor
after
a
silence
of
a
few
minutes
this
is
my
first
lesson
doctor
answered
prose
out
loud
and
muttering
in
continuation
i
do
declare
it
shall
be
the
last
it
a
very
amusing
study
continued
macallan
but
like
most
others
rather
dry
at
first
anything
but
dry
thought
prose
wiping
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
any
information
in
my
power
said
macallan
but
you
must
be
attentive
nothing
is
to
be
obtained
without
labour
i
sure
mineralogy
is
not
retorted
prose
throwing
down
his
crowbar
from
exhaustion
fortunately
for
prose
by
the
directions
of
the
interpreter
the
baggage
elephant
who
carried
the
tent
and
the
natives
accompanying
it
now
halted
opposite
to
the
rock
on
the
side
where
prose
was
for
the
wish
expressed
by
macallan
to
remain
there
had
been
construed
by
the
interpreter
as
a
selection
of
the
place
where
the
refreshments
should
be
prepared
one
of
the
natives
perceiving
what
prose
was
about
when
he
threw
away
the
crowbar
offered
his
assistance
which
was
readily
accepted
and
the
labour
was
continued
well
mr
prose
how
do
you
get
on
now
oh
capitally
do
you
find
it
very
warm
continued
macallan
who
stopped
to
wipe
the
streams
of
perspiration
from
his
own
face
oh
no
answered
prose
chuckling
well
i
do
i
can
assure
you
answered
the
doctor
who
not
wishing
to
show
symptoms
of
flagging
while
prose
was
working
so
hard
recommenced
his
labour
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
doctor
was
quite
exhausted
wishing
for
an
excuse
to
leave
off
himself
he
called
again
to
prose
a
you
tired
mr
prose
not
the
least
doctor
oh
but
you
must
be
you
had
better
rest
yourself
a
little
thank
you
but
i
not
the
least
tired
another
five
well
mr
prose
i
really
give
you
great
credit
for
your
perseverance
let
me
see
how
deep
you
are
said
macallan
who
could
find
no
other
excuse
for
being
the
first
to
abandon
his
task
but
prose
who
was
not
exactly
a
fool
determined
not
to
lose
his
credit
with
the
doctor
pushing
aside
the
native
he
took
the
crowbar
from
him
and
before
the
doctor
had
walked
round
was
again
hard
at
work
upon
my
honour
i
give
you
great
credit
observed
the
panting
macallan
as
he
witnessed
the
effects
of
the
labour
but
observed
prose
why
should
we
work
this
way
when
there
are
a
parcel
of
black
fellows
doing
nothing
here
i
say
you
chap
come
and
punch
here
continued
he
pointing
the
crowbar
to
the
native
who
immediately
resumed
his
labour
you
call
another
mr
macallan
and
make
him
work
for
you
well
thought
of
mr
prose
answered
the
doctor
and
another
native
being
put
in
requisition
in
less
than
an
hour
the
rock
was
perforated
to
the
depth
required
without
the
least
appearance
of
fatigue
or
even
heat
upon
the
skins
of
the
temperate
hindoos
in
the
meantime
the
tent
was
erected
the
mats
and
carpets
spread
the
fires
lighted
and
the
repast
preparing
by
the
cooks
who
were
in
attendance
the
doctor
who
was
absorbed
in
his
views
heeded
it
not
and
had
just
finished
the
charging
and
priming
of
the
rock
when
the
cavalcade
returned
from
their
excursion
well
doctor
how
do
you
get
on
inquired
courtenay
oh
i
all
ready
and
you
had
better
remove
to
a
little
distance
as
i
about
to
fire
my
trains
fire
your
trains
why
what
have
you
been
about
i
am
going
to
blast
the
rock
the
devil
you
are
then
i
off
cried
courtenay
who
with
seymour
retreated
from
the
effects
of
gunpowder
the
natives
who
accompanied
them
also
retired
although
not
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
operation
the
interpreter
understood
gentlemen
make
fireworks
and
reported
accordingly
the
doctor
lighted
his
matches
and
withdrew
followed
by
prose
who
forgot
his
limp
upon
this
occasion
the
mines
exploded
splitting
large
fragments
from
the
rock
and
shaking
it
from
its
base
capital
exclaimed
the
doctor
who
as
soon
as
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
ran
up
and
was
in
ecstasies
at
the
variety
and
brilliancy
of
the
specimens
which
were
now
exposed
to
his
eager
view
but
in
his
enthusiasm
the
doctor
quite
overlooked
the
mischief
which
he
had
occasioned
one
large
fragment
had
struck
the
tent
to
the
ground
others
had
scattered
the
cooking
utensils
with
their
contents
and
wounded
the
unfortunate
cooks
while
the
affrighted
elephant
had
completed
the
demolition
by
trotting
over
the
whole
his
trunk
raised
high
in
the
air
uttering
shrill
cries
and
regardless
of
the
admonitions
of
his
conductor
all
was
confusion
and
dismay
the
natives
when
they
witnessed
the
damage
were
astonished
a
long
consultation
took
place
between
them
as
to
what
the
doctor
meant
at
last
it
was
decided
by
the
grave
deputy
that
it
was
intended
as
a
compliment
to
them
for
all
fireworks
were
compliments
in
that
country
they
therefore
salaamed
with
great
good
humour
but
the
english
knew
better
and
commenced
a
violent
attack
on
macallan
who
was
still
absorbed
in
collecting
specimens
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
mischief
which
he
had
created
you
not
only
destroyed
our
dinner
continued
courtenay
but
killed
three
cooks
and
wounded
seven
more
is
it
possible
cried
macallan
with
dismay
throwing
away
his
specimens
with
as
much
haste
as
he
had
seized
upon
them
and
running
in
the
direction
of
the
men
reported
to
be
hurt
fortunately
for
his
peace
of
mind
courtenay
list
of
killed
was
all
invention
and
the
wounded
were
reduced
to
which
the
doctor
conscientiously
reported
under
the
head
of
there
was
no
help
but
to
proceed
to
town
and
wait
until
another
repast
could
be
provided
this
was
soon
done
and
the
interpreter
with
a
double
salaam
informed
the
doctor
that
if
gentleman
wish
blow
up
another
tent
deputy
have
one
ready
for
him
next
day
well
now
i
do
declare
these
people
are
very
polite
observed
prose
but
i
hope
that
if
you
do
doctor
you
will
not
make
me
a
party
to
it
i
would
never
have
punched
so
hard
at
that
hole
if
i
thought
that
it
was
to
have
blown
up
my
own
dinner
you
right
mr
prose
answered
courtenay
the
doctor
did
not
treat
us
according
to
the
scriptures
we
asked
for
bread
and
he
gave
us
a
stone
rather
annoying
too
after
a
long
ride
but
however
as
the
game
is
to
come
to
us
tomorrow
we
had
better
be
up
early
to
receive
it
in
due
form
so
good
night

shakespeare
at
an
early
hour
courtenay
and
his
companions
started
with
their
attendants
for
the
scene
of
action
several
elephants
as
well
as
horses
had
been
provided
that
the
officers
might
mount
them
when
they
arrived
and
fire
from
their
backs
with
more
deliberate
aim
in
less
than
two
hours
they
reached
the
spot
which
they
had
surveyed
the
day
before
the
game
which
had
been
driven
from
jungle
to
jungle
for
many
miles
round
was
now
collected
together
in
one
large
mass
of
underwood
and
low
trees
three
sides
of
which
were
surrounded
by
the
natives
who
had
been
employed
in
the
service
and
who
had
been
joined
by
many
hundreds
from
the
town
and
neighbouring
villages
as
soon
as
the
party
arrived
those
who
were
on
horseback
dismounted
took
their
stations
upon
the
howdahs
of
the
elephants
and
collected
at
the
corner
of
that
side
of
the
jungle
at
which
the
animals
were
to
be
driven
out
the
scene
was
one
of
the
most
animating
and
novel
description
forty
or
fifty
of
the
superior
classes
of
natives
mounted
upon
fiery
arabians
with
their
long
glittering
in
their
hands
and
above
one
hundred
on
foot
armed
with
muskets
surrounded
the
elephants
upon
which
the
officers
were
stationed
the
people
who
were
waiting
round
the
jungle
silent
themselves
and
busy
in
checking
the
noise
and
impatience
of
the
dogs
held
in
leashes
whose
deep
baying
was
occasionally
answered
by
a
low
growl
from
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
now
received
the
order
to
advance
shouts
and
yells
mixed
with
the
barking
of
the
dogs
were
raised
in
deafening
clamour
on
every
side
the
jungle
which
covered
a
space
of
fifteen
or
twenty
acres
and
which
had
hitherto
appeared
but
slightly
tenanted
answered
as
if
endued
with
life
by
waving
its
boughs
and
rustling
its
bushes
in
every
direction
although
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
as
they
advanced
beating
with
their
long
poles
and
preserving
a
straight
and
compact
line
through
which
nothing
could
escape
so
did
the
jungle
before
them
increase
its
motion
and
soon
the
yells
of
thousands
of
men
were
answered
by
the
roars
and
cries
of
thousands
of
brute
animals
it
was
not
however
until
the
game
had
been
driven
so
near
to
the
end
of
the
jungle
at
which
the
hunters
were
stationed
and
until
they
were
huddled
together
so
close
that
it
could
no
longer
contain
them
that
they
unwillingly
abandoned
it
the
most
timorous
the
rabbit
and
the
hare
and
all
the
smaller
tribes
first
broke
cover
and
were
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
but
they
were
soon
followed
by
the
whole
mass
who
as
if
by
agreement
among
themselves
had
determined
at
once
to
decide
their
fate
crowded
in
incongruous
heaps
without
any
distinction
of
species
or
of
habits
now
poured
out
the
various
denizens
of
the
woods
deer
in
every
variety
locking
their
horns
in
their
wild
confusion
the
fierce
bristling
in
their
rage
the
bounding
leopards
the
swift
antelope
of
every
species
the
savage
panthers
jackals
and
foxes
and
all
the
screaming
and
shrieking
infinities
of
the
monkey
tribe
occasionally
amongst
the
dense
mass
could
be
perceived
the
huge
rolling
in
convolutions
now
looking
back
with
fiery
eyes
upon
his
pursuers
now
precipitating
his
flight
while
the
air
was
thronged
with
its
winged
tenants
wildly
screaming
and
occasionally
dropping
down
dead
with
fear
to
crown
the
whole
high
in
the
expanse
a
multitude
of
vultures
appeared
almost
stationary
on
the
wing
waiting
for
their
share
of
the
anticipated
slaughter
and
as
the
beasts
threw
down
and
rolled
over
each
other
in
their
mad
career
you
might
have
fancied
from
the
universal
terror
which
prevailed
that
it
was
a
day
of
judgment
to
which
the
inhabitants
had
been
summoned
it
was
not
a
day
of
mercy
the
slaughter
commenced
shot
after
shot
laid
them
in
the
dust
while
the
natives
on
their
arabians
charged
with
their
spears
into
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
regardless
of
the
risk
which
they
encountered
from
the
muskets
of
other
parties
the
baying
of
the
large
dogs
who
tore
down
their
victims
the
din
occasionally
increased
by
the
contention
and
growls
of
the
assailed
the
yells
of
the
natives
and
the
shrill
cries
of
the
elephants
raised
in
obedience
to
their
conductors
to
keep
the
more
ferocious
animals
at
a
distance
formed
a
scene
to
which
no
pen
can
do
justice
in
a
few
minutes
all
was
over
those
who
had
escaped
were
once
more
hid
panting
in
the
neighbouring
jungles
while
those
who
had
fallen
covered
the
ground
in
every
direction
and
in
every
variety
very
fine
sar
observed
the
interpreter
to
courtenay
with
exultation
very
fine
indeed
seymour
this
is
something
like
a
battue
what
would
some
of
your
english
sportsmen
have
given
to
have
been
here
but
interpreter
i
do
see
any
tigers
great
tigers
no
sar
no
great
tiger
in
this
country
call
dis
tiger
said
the
man
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
prostrate
leopard
such
is
the
case
the
regal
bengal
tiger
as
well
as
his
rival
the
lion
admits
of
no
copartnership
in
his
demesnes
on
the
banks
of
the
impetuous
rivers
of
india
he
ranges
alone
the
jungles
which
supply
his
wants
and
permits
them
not
to
be
poached
by
inferior
sportsmen
basking
his
length
in
the
sun
and
playing
about
his
graceful
tail
he
prohibits
the
intrusion
of
the
panther
or
the
leopard
his
majestic
compeer
seems
to
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
him
that
they
shall
not
interfere
with
each
other
manorial
rights
and
where
you
find
the
royal
tiger
you
need
not
dread
the
presence
of
the
lion
each
has
established
his
dominion
where
it
has
pleased
him
both
respecting
each
other
and
leaving
the
rest
of
the
world
to
be
preyed
upon
by
their
inferiors
well
prose
how
many
did
you
kill
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
seymour
i
never
fired
my
musket
i
was
so
astonished
and
so
frightened
that
i
could
not
i
never
believed
that
there
were
so
many
beasts
in
the
whole
universe
i
am
convinced
observed
macallan
that
i
saw
an
animal
hitherto
undescribed
i
fired
at
it
but
an
antelope
bounded
by
as
i
pulled
my
trigger
and
received
the
ball
i
never
regretted
anything
so
much
in
my
life
did
you
see
it
i
saw
a
number
of
most
indescribable
animals
replied
courtenay
but
let
us
descend
and
walk
over
the
field
of
slaughter
the
party
dismounted
and
for
some
time
amused
themselves
with
examining
the
variety
of
the
slain
the
deer
and
antelopes
were
the
most
plentiful
but
on
enumeration
nine
panthers
and
leopards
and
fifteen
headed
the
list
prose
and
seymour
were
walking
side
by
side
when
they
perceived
a
monkey
sitting
on
the
ground
with
a
most
pitiful
face
it
was
of
a
small
variety
with
a
long
tail
it
made
no
effort
to
escape
as
they
approached
it
but
on
the
contrary
appeared
to
court
their
notice
by
looking
at
them
with
a
melancholy
air
and
uttering
loud
cries
as
if
in
pain
poor
little
fellow
said
seymour
apostrophising
the
animal
it
looks
as
if
it
were
a
rational
where
are
you
hurt
the
monkey
as
if
it
were
a
rational
being
looked
down
at
one
of
his
hind
legs
and
put
his
finger
into
the
wound
where
the
ball
had
entered
well
now
i
do
declare
said
prose
but
the
poor
beast
understands
you
seymour
examined
the
leg
without
any
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
monkey
who
continued
to
look
first
at
the
wound
and
then
in
their
faces
as
if
to
say
why
did
you
do
it
macallan
come
here
ejaculated
seymour
and
see
if
you
can
assist
this
poor
little
fellow
macallan
came
up
and
examined
the
wound
i
think
it
will
recover
the
bone
is
not
broken
and
no
vital
part
is
touched
we
bandage
it
up
and
take
him
home
how
very
like
a
human
being
it
is
observed
courtenay
it
appears
only
to
want
speech
it
really
excessively
annoying
rather
mortifying
to
our
pride
i
grant
replied
macallan
that
exactly
what
i
mean
seymour
tore
up
his
handkerchief
for
bandages
and
the
monkey
was
consigned
to
the
care
of
a
native
it
eventually
recovered
and
from
the
peculiarity
of
its
history
and
the
request
of
seymour
was
allowed
by
captain
m
to
remain
on
board
of
the
frigate
where
it
became
a
great
favourite
high
caste
on
the
contrary
disappeared
a
few
days
after
his
reception
having
been
thrown
overboard
by
some
of
the
people
that
he
had
bitten
and
captain
m
made
no
inquiries
after
him
so
much
for
the
two
monkeys
by
this
time
the
natives
had
collected
the
game
which
was
carried
in
procession
before
the
officers
the
leopards
and
panthers
which
they
skinned
and
rudely
stuffed
with
grass
in
an
incredibly
short
time
leading
the
procession
followed
by
the
wild
boars
deer
and
antelopes
each
carried
between
two
men
slung
under
bamboos
which
rested
on
their
shoulders
the
procession
having
passed
in
review
before
them
continued
its
course
to
the
town
followed
by
crowds
of
people
who
had
come
out
to
join
the
sport
gentlemen
like
dine

inquired
the
interpreter
soon
make
dinner
ready
but
no
ab
tent
thanks
to
doctor
they
wo
trust
us
with
another
i
vote
we
dine
here
for
i
am
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
buffalo
without
anchovy
sauce
eh
mr
prose
let
us
dine
under
yon
acacia
on
the
little
mount
there
is
a
fine
breeze
blowing
and
plenty
of
shade
from
the
tree
courtenay
proposal
was
agreed
to
and
the
interpreter
gave
the
directions
he
then
told
the
doctor
that
if
saib
wished
to
see
he
come
now
and
bring
very
fine
snake
the
man
made
his
appearance
holding
in
his
hand
a
small
earthen
chatty
or
pot
in
which
he
had
confined
the
snake
covered
over
with
a
linen
rag
he
exchanged
a
few
sentences
with
the
interpreter
who
explained
that
man
not
afraid
of
bite
of
snake
and
if
gentleman
give
him
rupee
he
let
snake
bite
him
man
eat
herb
same
as
little
beast
that
kill
snake
oh
that
plant
that
the
ichneumon
resorts
to
when
bitten
exclaimed
macallan
this
will
be
a
most
curious
fact
and
i
must
witness
it
interpreter
tell
him
that
i
will
reward
him
handsomely
how
does
he
catch
the
snakes
inquired
seymour
blow
little
pipe
sar
replied
the
interpreter
pointing
to
a
small
reed
perforated
with
five
or
six
holes
suspended
by
a
string
to
the
man
neck
snake
like
music
he
then
proceeded
to
explain
the
manner
of
taking
the
snakes
which
was
effected
by
lying
down
close
to
the
hole
where
the
snake
was
and
by
playing
a
few
soft
notes
with
the
pipe
the
snake
attracted
by
the
sound
puts
his
head
out
of
the
hole
and
is
immediately
firmly
grasped
by
the
neck
by
which
he
is
held
until
his
fangs
are
extracted
by
jerking
them
out
with
a
piece
of
rag
held
for
him
to
bite
at
strange
observed
courtenay
that
snakes
should
be
fond
of
music
and
still
stranger
that
people
should
have
discovered
it
and
yet
it
has
long
been
known
perhaps
from
time
immemorial
answered
macallan
the
comparisons
of
scripture
are
all
derived
from
eastern
scenery
and
eastern
customs
do
you
not
recollect
the
words
of
the
psalmist
who
compareth
the
wicked
to
the
deaf
adder
who
not
harken
to
the
voice
of
the
charmer
charm
he
never
so
wisely
i
recollect
it
now
answered
courtenay
from
which
i
infer
that
as
snakes
are
not
caught
for
nothing
they
danced
before
king
solomon
perhaps
they
did
or
at
least
in
his
time
the
man
carefully
removed
the
cloth
from
the
top
of
the
chatty
and
watching
his
opportunity
seized
the
snake
by
the
neck
who
immediately
wound
itself
round
his
arm
holding
it
in
that
position
he
rapidly
chewed
leaves
which
he
had
wrapped
in
the
cloth
which
encircled
his
loins
after
having
laid
a
heap
of
the
masticated
leaves
near
him
he
swallowed
a
large
quantity
and
then
applied
the
head
of
the
snake
to
his
left
ear
which
the
animal
immediately
bit
so
as
to
draw
blood
it
was
a
cobra
di
capella
of
the
largest
size
being
nearly
six
feet
long
as
soon
as
the
snake
had
bitten
him
he
replaced
it
in
the
chatty
and
at
the
same
time
that
he
continued
to
swallow
the
leaves
rubbed
the
wounded
part
with
some
of
the
heap
which
he
had
masticated
and
laid
down
beside
him
there
was
a
silence
and
a
degree
of
painful
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
spectators
during
the
process
the
man
appeared
to
be
sick
and
giddy
and
lay
down
but
gradually
recovered
and
making
a
low
salaam
received
his
largess
handed
the
snake
in
the
chatty
to
macallan
and
departed
a
most
curious
fact
an
excessively
curious
fact
observed
the
doctor
putting
up
his
tablets
and
a
handful
of
the
leaves
which
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
obtain
now
gentlemen
dinner
all
ready
observed
the
interpreter
the
dinner
had
been
spread
out
on
the
little
mount
pointed
out
by
courtenay
it
rose
isolated
from
the
plain
to
the
height
of
about
thirty
feet
with
a
steep
and
regular
ascent
on
every
side
the
summit
was
flat
and
in
the
centre
the
acacia
waved
its
graceful
and
pendent
flowers
to
the
breeze
each
moment
altering
the
position
of
the
bright
spot
of
sunshine
which
pierced
through
its
branches
and
reflected
on
the
grass
beneath
the
party
consisting
of
the
officers
of
the
ship
the
grave
deputy
and
his
immediate
suite
about
fifteen
in
number
whose
appetites
were
keen
from
their
morning
exercise
and
excitement
gladly
hailed
the
summons
and
seating
themselves
in
a
circle
round
the
viands
which
were
spread
under
the
tree
crossed
their
legs
after
the
mahometan
custom
and
made
a
furious
attack
upon
the
provender
macallan
to
secure
his
treasure
hung
the
chatty
by
its
string
upon
one
of
the
long
thorns
of
the
acacia
and
then
took
his
seat
with
the
rest
ample
justice
having
been
done
to
what
had
been
placed
before
them
mirth
and
prevailed
courtenay
had
just
persuaded
the
grave
old
deputy
to
break
through
the
precepts
of
his
religion
and
partake
of
the
forbidden
cup
in
the
shape
of
a
tumbler
of
madeira
when
the
chatty
which
the
doctor
had
suspended
aloft
by
the
constant
waving
of
the
tree
to
the
wind
worked
off
the
thorn
and
falling
down
in
the
very
centre
of
the
circle
smashed
into
atoms
and
the
cobra
di
capella
met
their
gaze
reared
upon
the
very
tip
of
his
tail
his
hood
expanded
to
the
utmost
in
his
wrath
hissing
horribly
and
darting
out
his
forked
tongue
wavering
among
the
many
upon
whom
first
to
dart
never
was
a
convivial
party
so
suddenly
dispersed
for
one
and
but
one
moment
they
were
all
paralysed
no
one
attempted
to
get
up
and
run
away
then
as
if
by
a
simultaneous
thought
they
all
threw
themselves
back
tossing
their
heels
over
their
heads
and
continuing
their
eccentric
career
mussulmen
and
europeans
all
tumbled
backwards
heels
over
heads
down
the
descent
diverging
in
every
point
of
the
compass
until
they
reached
their
respective
situations
at
the
bottom
of
the
mount
while
the
cobra
di
capella
still
remained
in
his
menacing
attitude
as
if
satisfied
with
the
universal
homage
paid
to
his
dreadful
powers
they
all
recovered
their
legs
as
they
had
gained
the
bottom
of
the
hill
about
the

time
courtenay
and
seymour
now
that
the
danger
was
over

with

starting
out

declare
the
deputy
as
grave
as
ever
and
the
remainder
fortunately
more
frightened
than
they
were
hurt
one
of
the
native
servants
put
an
end
to
the
scene
by
reascending
the
hill
with
a
long
bamboo
with
which
he
struck
the
animal
to
the
ground
and
subsequently
despatched
him
by
this
time
all
had
recovered
from
their
alarm
and
in
a
few
minutes
their
seats
were
resumed
the
doctor
who
was
vexed
at
the
loss
of
his
snake
commenced
an
examination
of
the
body
and
was
still
more
mortified
to
find
that
the
wily
hindoo
had
deceived
him
the
venomous
fangs
having
been
already
extracted
it
is
positively
a
fact
observed
he
to
courtenay
in
he
has
cheated
me
a
most
curious
fact
replied
courtenay
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
and
lowering
the
corners
of
his
mouth

macallan
what

many
years
their

it
almost

the

a

when

shall
arrive

read
that
liberty
was
once
the
watchword
of
the
isle
and
yet
not
even
feel
a
longing
to
be
free
as
the
lay
nearly
becalmed
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
a
small
boat
rowed
by
two
men
pulled
towards
her
and
the
occupant
of
the
as
he
came
alongside
stated
in
bad
english
that
he
brought
present
for
captain
and
was
allowed
to
come
up
the
side
by
the
who
was
on
deck
he
was
a
native
friar
and
disgusting
as
the
dress
is
when
worn
by
an
european
in
a
northern
clime
it
appeared
still
more
so
enveloping
a
black
under
the
torrid
zone
he
carried
a
little
covered
basket
in
his
hand
and
stated
that
he
had
been
sent
by
the
superior
of
the
convent
which
he
pointed
to
on
the
headland
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
the
went
down
into
the
cabin
and
reported
to
the
captain
a
present
observed
captain
m
i
hope
it
is
not
a
monkey
danaos
et

the
who
had
forgotten
his
latin
made
no
answer
but
returned
on
deck
where
he
was
shortly
after
followed
by
captain
m
the
sable
votary
of
francis
made
his
bow
and
opening
the
lid
of
his
basket
pulled
out
a
cabbage
with
a
long
stalk
and
four
or
five
flagging
leaves
but
no
heart
to
it
superior
send
present
to
inglez
capitown
and
having
laid
it
carefully
on
the
carronade
slide
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
some
time
and
eventually
produced
a
dirty
sheet
of
paper
on
which
written
in
execrable
english
was
a
petition
to
assist
the
wants
of
the
convent
i
expected
as
much
observed
captain
m
smiling
as
he
ran
over
the
ridiculous
wording
of
the
petition
desire
the
purser
steward
to
get
up
a
bag
of
biscuit
and
put
into
the
boat
the
bread
was
handed
on
the
gangway
when
the
friar
observing
it
went
up
to
the
captain
and
said
superior
like
rum
sar
suppose
you
no
rum
then
like
money
perhaps
he
may
replied
captain
m
but
it
is
against
my
rules
to
give
the
first
and
if
i
recollect
right
against
those
of
your
order
to
receive
the
second
finding
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
obtained
the
friar
was
about
to
depart
when
perceiving
the
cabbage
lying
unnoticed
where
he
had
deposited
it
he
observed
capitown
non
quer
cabbage
not
want
not
particularly
replied
captain
m
surveying
it
with
rather
a
contemptuous
smile
then
take
it
ashore
plant
it
again
do
for
ship
and
he
replaced
the
present
in
his
basket
made
his
bow
and
departed

just
finished

attired
in

about
a
dozen
pages
of
the

were
filled
with
certificates
to
the
above
effect
which
the
dubash
although
he
spoke
english
fluently
not
being
able
to
read
considered
as
he
had
been
informed
at
the
time
to
be
decidedly
in
his
favour
they
were
so
far
valuable
that
they
put
newcomers
upon
their
guard
and
prevented
much
extortion
on
the
part
of
the
said
hommajee
when
the
laughter
had
to
a
degree
subsided
billy

was
the

billy
observed
courtenay
it
bad
enough
to
have
murdered
shakespeare
well
but
now
it
my
opinion
that
we
ought
to
employ
this
fellow
and
take
the
advice
that
has
been
given
to
us
in
this
book
courtenay
proposal
was
assented
to
and
on
his
return
hommajee
baba
was
installed
in
office
the
next
morning
seymour
courtenay
and
macallan
went
on
shore
to
meet
an
old
acquaintance
of
the
latter
who
had
called
upon
him
on
his
arrival
by
his
advice
they
left
the
ship
before
the
sun
had
risen
that
they
might
be
enabled
to
walk
about
and
view
the
town
and
its
environs
without
being
incommoded
by
the
heat
they
reached
the
long
plain
close
to
the
sea
upon
which
the
admiral
and
many
others
according
to
the
custom
of
the
english
inhabitants
were
residing
in
capacious
tents
not
such
tents
as
have
been
seen
in
england
but
impervious
to
the
heat
and
rain
covering
a
large
extent
of
ground
divided
into
several
apartments
and
furnished
like
any
other
residence
the
broad
expanse
of
ocean
which
met
their
view
was
unruffled
and
the
beach
was
lined
with
hundreds
standing
on
their
carpets
spread
upon
the
sand
with
their
faces
turned
toward
the
east
as
the
sun
rose
in
splendour
above
the
horizon
they
all
prostrated
themselves
in
mute
adoration
and
continued
in
that
position
until
his
disk
had
cleared
the
water
edge
they
then
rose
and
throwing
a
few
flowers
into
the
rippling
wave
folded
up
their
carpets
and
departed
who
are
those
people
and
of
what
religion
demanded
seymour
they
are
parsees
a
remnant
of
the
ancient
persians
the
guebres
or
worshippers
of
fire
as
you
have
witnessed
they
also
adore
the
sun
they
came
here
long
since
to
enjoy
their
tenets
free
from
persecution
they
are
the
most
intelligent
race
that
we
have
many
of
them
were
princes
in
their
own
country
and
are
now
men
of
unbounded
wealth
they
have
their
temples
here
in
which
the
sacred
fire
is
never
permitted
to
go
out
if
by
any
chance
or
negligence
it
should
become
extinct
it
must
be
relighted
from
heaven
alone
we
have
no
lightning
here
and
they
send
to
calcutta
where
there
is
plenty
at
the
change
of
the
monsoon
and
bring
it
round
with
great
ceremony
in
other
points
are
their
customs
different
from
the
hindoos
yes
their
women
are
not
so
immured
you
will
meet
plenty
of
them
when
you
return
to
town
they
are
easily
distinguished
by
their
fair
complexions
and
the
large
thin
gold
rings
with
three
or
four
pearls
strung
upon
them
worn
in
a
hole
perforated
through
the
nostril
and
hanging
below
their
mouths
and
what
are
those
immense
towers
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
they
were
built
by
the
parsees
as
depositories
for
the
dead
on
the
summit
is
a
wide
iron
grating
upon
which
the
bodies
are
laid
to
be
devoured
by
the
birds
of
prey
when
stripped
the
bones
fall
through
the
iron
bars
into
the
receptacle
below
they
never
bury
their
but
breakfast
must
be
ready
so
we
had
better
return
you
have
much
to
see
here
the
caves
of
elephanta
and
canara
are
well
worthy
of
your
attention
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
attend
you
when
you
feel
inclined
to
pay
a
visit
to
them
they
did
not
fail
to
profit
by
the
offer
and
before
the
week
had
passed
away
they
had
witnessed
those
splendid
monuments
of
superstition
and
idolatry
the
received
her
orders
and
hommajee
baba
being
paid
the
due
proportion
of
his
bill
received
his
certificate
from
courtenay
in
the
usual
form
and
so
far
from
being
affronted
requested
the
honour
of
being
again
employed
in
their
services
if
ever
they
should
return
to

forty
six

are

whom
it
would
be
safe

will
repay

magnanimity
with
secret
stabs
anon
the
strength
of
the
monsoon
had
blown
over
and
captain
m
in
pursuance
of
his
orders
beat
across
the
bay
of

for
the
straits
of

where
he
expected
to
fall
in
with
some
of
the
privateers
who
obtained
their
supplies
of
water
in
that
direction
after
cruising
for
six
weeks
without
success
they
fell
in
with
an
armed
english
vessel
who
informed
them
that
she
had
been
chased
by
a
large
pirate
proa
and
had
narrowly
escaped
acquainting
captain
m
with
the
islet
from
which
she
had
sallied
out
in
pursuit
of
them
and
to
which
she
had

cruel
marauders

showed
no

misfortune
to
fall
into

to
proceed
in

of

vessel
and
after

week
unsuccessful
reconnoitre
of

cover

quarter
one
morning

down
towards

ascertain
whether
she

she
might
venture
to
attack
the
was
disguised
as
much
as
possible
and
the
pirates
were
induced
to
approach
within
a
distance
of
two
miles
when
perceiving
their
mistake
they
lowered
their
sails
and
turning
the
head
of
their
vessel
in
the
opposite
direction
pulled
away
from
the
frigate
right
in
the
wind
eye
the
breeze
freshened
and
all
possible

was
crowded
on
the
to
overtake
them
and
although
at
the
close
of
the
day
they
had
not
neared
her
much
the
bright
moon
enabled
them
to
keep
the
vessel
in
view
during
the
night
early
in
the
morning
the
crew
being
probably
exhausted
from
their
incessant
labour
she
kept
away
for
some
islets
broad
upon
the
weather
bow
and
came
to
an
anchor
in
a
small
cove
between
the
rocks
which
sheltered
her
from
the
guns
of
the
frigate
captain
m
considered
it
his
duty
at
all
risks
to
destroy
the
proa
and
hoisting
out
the
boats
he
gave
the
command
to
his
with
strict
injunctions

to
deal
with

treacherous
and
ferocious
enemies
the
launch
was
under
repair
at
the
time
and

the
barge

obtained

accordingly
the

shoved
off

get
alongside
i
say
mr
jolly
ca
you
pull
yes
sir
upon
a
pinch
answered
the
marine
whom
he
addressed
laying
his
musket
on
the
and
taking
one
of
the
unmanned
oars
well
there
now
give
way
but
the
delay
occasioned
by
this
mishap
had
left
the
cutter
far
astern
of
the
other
boats
who
paying
no
attention
to
her
had
pulled
alongside
and
boarded
the
vessel
the
conflict
was
short
from
the
superior
numbers
of
the
english
and
the
little
difficulty
in
getting
on
board
of
a
vessel
with
so
low
a
gunwale
by
the
time
that
prose
came
alongside
in
the
cutter
the
pirates
were
either
killed
or
had
been
driven
below
prose
jumped
on
the
gunwale
flourishing
his
cutlass
from
the
gunwale
he
sprung
on
the
deck
which
was
not
composed
of
planks
as
in
vessels
in
general
but
of
long
bamboos
running
fore
and
aft
and
lashed
together
with
rattans
and
as
prose
descended
upon
the
rounded
surface
which
happened
where
he
alighted
to
be
slippery
with
blood
his
feet
were
thrown
up
and
he
came
down
on
the
deck
in
a
sitting
posture
capital
jump
mr
prose
cried
courtenay
but
you
have
arrived
too
late
to
shed
your
blood
in
your
country
cause
very
annoying
it
o
lord
o
lord
i
do
declare
oh
oh
oh
roared
prose
attempting
to
recover
his
feet
and
then
falling
down
again
good
heavens
what
the
matter
prose
cried
seymour
running
to
his
assistance
o
lord
o
lord
another
oh
again
cried
prose
making
a
half
spring
from
the
deck
from
which
he
was
now
raised
by
seymour
who
again
inquired
what
was
the
matter
prose
could
not
speak
he
pointed
his
hand
behind
him
and
his
head
fell
upon
seymour
shoulder
he
wounded
sir
observed
one
of
the
men
who
had
joined
seymour
pointing
to
the
blood
which
ran
from
the
trousers
of
prose
in
a
little
rivulet
be
quick
mr
seymour
and
get
on
the
gunwale
or
have
you
too
the
fact
was
that
the
deck
being
composed
of
bamboos
as
already
described
one
of
the
pirates
below
had
passed
his
creese
through
the
spaces
between
them
into
prose
body
when
he
came
down
on
deck
in
a
sitting
posture
and
had
repeated
the
blow
when
he
failed
to
recover
his
feet
after
the
first
wound
one
of
the
seamen
who
had
not
provided
himself
with
shoes
now
received
a
severe
wound
and
after
prose
had
been
handed
into
one
of
the
boats
a
consultation
was
held
as
to
the
most
eligible
method
of
proceeding
it
was
soon
decided
that
it
would
be
the
extreme
of
folly
to
attack
such
desperate
people
below
where
they
would
have
a
great
advantage
with
their
creeses
over
the
cutlasses
of
the
seamen
and
as
there
appeared
no
chance
of
inducing
them
to
come
up
it
was
determined
to
cut
the
cables
and
tow
the
vessel
alongside
of
the
frigate
who
could
sink
her
with
a
broadside
the
cables
were
cut
and
a
few
men
being
left
on
board
to
guard
the
hatchways
the
boats
commenced
towing
out
but
scarcely
had
they
got
way
on
her
when
to
their
astonishment
a
thick
smoke
was
followed
by
the
flames
bursting
out
in
every
direction
consuming
all
on
board
with
a
rapidity
that
seemed
incredible
from
the
deck
the
fire
mounted
to
the
rigging
thence
to
the
masts
and
sails
and
before
the
boats
could
be
backed
astern
to
take
them
out
those
who
had
been
left
were
forced
to
leap
into
the
sea
to
save
themselves
from
the
devouring
element
the
pirates
had
themselves
set
fire
to
the
vessel
most
of
them
remained
below
submitting
to
suffocation
with
sullen
indifference
some
few
in
the
agony
of
combustion
were
perceived
through
the
smoke
to
leap
overboard
and
seek
in
preference
a
less
painful
death
the
boats
laid
upon
their
oars
and
witnessed
the
scene
in
silence
and
astonishment
desperate
and
determined
to
the
last
observed
the
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
proa
whose
fabric
was
of
the
slightest
materials
filled
and
went
down
the
last
column
of
smoke
divided
from
her
by
the
water
ascended
in
the
air
as
she
sank
down
below
and
nought
remained
but
a
few
burnt
fragments
of
bamboo
which
lay
floating
on
the
wave
a
few
seconds
after
the
vessel
had
disappeared
one
of
the
pirates
rose
to
the
surface
there
is
a
man
alive
yet
observed
courtenay
let
us
save
him
if
we
can
the
boat
by
his
directions
pulled
a
few
strokes
of
the
oars
and
having
rather
too
much
way
shot
ahead
so
as
to
bring
the
man
close
to
the
counter
of
the
boat
courtenay
leaned
over
the
gunwale
to
haul
him
in
the
malignant
wretch
grasped
him
by
the
collar
with
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
darted
his
creese
into
courtenay
breast
then
as
if
satisfied
with
an
air
of
mingled
defiance
and
derision
immediately
sank
under
the
bottom
of
the
pinnace
and
was
seen
no
more
ungrateful
viper
murmured
courtenay
as
he
fell
into
the
arms
of
his
men
the
boats
hastened
back
to
the
frigate
they
had
but
few
men
hurt
except
those
mentioned
in
our
narrative
but
the
wounds
of
courtenay
and
of
prose
were
dangerous
the
creeses
of
the
pirates
had
been
steeped
in
the
juice
of
the
which
when
fresh
applied
is
considered
as
a
deadly
poison
the
aspasia
soon
afterwards
anchored
in
madras
roads
and
a
removal
to
a
more
invigorating
clime
was
pronounced
essential
to
the
recovery
of
the
two
officers
courtenay
and
prose
were
invalided
and
sent
home
in
an
east
but
it
was
many
months
before
they
were
in
a
state
of
convalescence
captain
m
gave
an
acting
order
as
lieutenant
to
seymour
and
when
he
joined
the
admiral
expressed
himself
so
warmly
in
his
behalf
that
it
was
not
superseded
and
our
hero
now
walked
the
as
of
ship
if
the
reader
is
not
by
this
time
tired
of
india
i
am
to
narrate
all
that
occurred
would
far
exceed
the
limits
of
this
work
i
shall
therefore
confine
myself
to
stating
that
after
three
years
captain
m
quitted
the
country
having
during
his
stay
gained
much
in
reputation
but
lost
more
in
constitution
when
we
return
to
the
frigate
she
will
be
well
advanced
on
her
passage
home
chapter
forty
seven
when
souls
which
should
agree
to
will
the
same
to
have
one
common
object
for
their
wishes
look
ways
regardless
of
each
other
think
what
a
train
of
wretchedness
ensues
rowe
but
we
must
return
to
england
or
we
shall
lose
sight
of
the
rainscourt
family
in
which
much
that
is
interesting
has
occurred
since
our
absence
in
the
east
mr
rainscourt
made
occasional
visits
to
the
hall
with
the
hope
of
inducing
his
wife
to
break
through
her
resolution
and
once
more
to
reside
with
him
under
the
same
roof
but
in
this
he
could
not
succeed
for
although
mrs
rainscourt
received
him
with
kindness
and
urbanity
she
was
too
well
aware
by
information
received
from
many
quarters
of
the
life
of
excess
which
he
indulged
in
ever
again
to
trust
her
happiness
in
his
keeping
nevertheless
pursuing
his
point
with
an
obstinacy
that
seemed
surprising
rainscourt
always
was
to
be
found
at
the
to
which
mrs
rainscourt
might
remove
for
change
of
scene
and
for
nearly
five
years
from
the
time
when
he
first
paid
a
visit
to
his
once
neglected
wife
did
he
continue
to
press
his
suit
the
fact
was
that
so
far
from
tiring
his
anxiety
to
effect
the
reunion
was
constantly
on
the
increase
from
the
general
admiration
which
was
bestowed
upon
emily
when
she
made
her
appearance
in
public
and
rainscourt
felt
that
his
house
would
be
more
resorted
to
and
his
company
be
more
courted
if
he
could
have
under
his
immediate
protection
one
who
had
beauty
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
most
fastidious
and
a
certainty
of
ultimate
wealth
exceeding
the
views
of
the
most
interested
it
was
two
years
or
more
after
the
departure
of
seymour
that
mrs
rainscourt
and
emily
determined
upon
passing
the
autumnal
months
at
cheltenham
accompanied
by
the
mcelvinas
a
few
days
after
their
arrival
mr
rainscourt
made
his
appearance
he
was
now
determined
if
possible
to
bring
his
suit
to
an
issue
some
months
back
he
had
formed
the
plan
which
he
thought
most
likely
to
succeed
this
was
to
repair
and
refurnish
the
castle
in
galway
and
persuade
mrs
rainscourt
to
pass
a
few
weeks
there
when
he
hoped
that
having
her
in
a
more
isolated
position
she
might
be
induced
to
accede
to
his
wishes
workmen
had
been
employed
for
some
time
repairing
the
exterior
of
the
ancient
pile
the
interior
had
been
embellished
under
the
guidance
of
a
man
of
taste
and
without
any
regard
to
expense
splendid
furniture
had
already
been
forwarded
from
london
so
that
mr
rainscourt
agent
had
written
to
him
that
in
a
few
weeks
the
castle
would
be
ready
for
his
reception
upon
his
arrival
at
cheltenham
mr
rainscourt
astonished
everybody
by
his
splendid
equipage
his
carriages
his
stud
and
the
whole
of
his
establishment
were
quite
unique
on
the
other
hand
mrs
rainscourt
and
her
daughter
were
equally
objects
of
curiosity
not
likely
to
pass
unnoticed
in
such
a
place
as
cheltenham
where
people
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
talk
scandal
and
to
drink
salt
water
as
a
punishment
the
arrival
of
a
pretty
heiress
increased
very
much
the
flow
of
bile
in
the
young
ladies
and
in
their
mammas
who
did
not
bring
them
to
cheltenham
merely
to
drink
the
waters
the
gentlemen
moreover
did
not
admire
being
so
totally
eclipsed
by
mr
rainscourt
who
rendered
insignificant
what
previous
to
his
appearance
had
been
considered
to
be
quite
the
thing
the
ladies
would
talk
of
nothing
but
mr
rainscourt
and
his
equipage
and
such
a
handsome
man
too
but
on
the
whole
the
females
were
the
most
annoyed
as
there
threatened
to
be
a
stagnation
in
the
market
until
this
said
heiress
was
disposed
of
gentlemen
who
had
been
attentive
more
than
a
week
who
had
been
asked
twice
to
dinner
and
who
had
been
considered
to
have
nibbled
a
sufficient
time
to
ensure
their
eventually
taking
the
bait
had
darted
in
full
liberty
in
the
direction
of
the
great
heiress
young
ladies
who
were
acknowledged
to
have
the
most
attractions
pecuniary
or
personal
who
simpered
and
smiled
to
twenty
young
philanderers
as
they
took
their
morning
glass
now
poured
down
their
lukewarm
solution
in
indignant
solitude
if
mrs
rainscourt
and
her
daughter
made
their
appearance
on
the
promenade
real
cases
of
bile
became
common
and
the
fair
sex
in
despair
although
they
did
not
as
they
were
evidently
requested
by
the
conduct
of
the
gentlemen
to
a
nunnery
go
to
preserve
their
complexions
were
necessitated
to
repair
to
the
pump
do
you
think
that
miss
rainscourt
nose
is
rather
too
straight
asked
a
young
lady
with
one
on
her
own
face
that
had
a
strong
tendency
towards
the
pug
indeed
i
do
not
replied
a
irish
girl
although
she
has
put
ours
out
of
joint
as
they
call
it
i
only
wish
i
her
face
or
her
fortune
either
the
one
or
the
other
and
i
would
be
coming
to
cheltenham
after
a
husband
the
gentlemen
should
trot
over
to
ireland
how
very
odd
that
mr
and
mrs
rainscourt
should
not
live
together
such
good
friends
as
they
seem
to
be
oh
i
know
the
reason
of
that
i
was
told
it
yesterday
by
lady
wagtail
it
was
a
runaway
match
and
they
happened
to
be
related
within
the
canonical
law
they
are
both
roman
catholics
and
the
pope
found
it
out
and
ordered
them
to
be
separated
upon
pain
of
excommunication
indeed
yes
and
mr
rainscourt
is
waiting
for
a
licence
from
the
conclave
a
dispensation
they
call
it
they
say
it
is
expected
from
rome
next
post
and
then
they
can
be
united
again
immediately
what
beautiful
horses
mr
rainscourt
drives
yes
that
curricle
with
the
greys
and
the
outriders
is
quite
superb
he
always
drives
through
the
turnpike
i
observe
to
be
sure
he
does
why
they
say
that
he
has
pounds
a
year
and
the
whole
is
entailed
upon
his
daughter
every
farthing
of
it
and
who
are
those
mcelvina
what
an
odd
name
oh
i
can
tell
you
mrs
fitzpatrick
says
that
he
is
of
a
very
ancient
irish
family
they
are
very
rich
mr
mcelvina
made
his
fortune
in
india
by
a
speculation
in
opium
and
his
wife
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
in
the
city
who
died
worth
a
plum
number
a
little
warm
if
you
please
mrs
bishop
yes
miss
about
a
fortnight
after
his
arrival
rainscourt
received
the
intelligence
from
his
agent
that
everything
was
complete
at
the
castle
and
he
determined
to
go
over
himself
to
examine
it
previous
to
communicating
his
interested
act
of
gallantry
to
his
wife
he
proposed
to
mcelvina
with
whom
he
was
on
very
friendly
terms
to
accompany
him
and
mcelvina
was
decided
in
accepting
the
offer
in
consequence
of
mr
rainscourt
having
informed
him
that
a
large
property
contiguous
to
his
own
which
had
almost
from
time
immemorial
been
in
possession
of
the
mcelvina
family
was
now
for
sale
the
last
possessor
having
gambled
the
whole
of
it
away
it
may
be
worth
your
while
continued
he
if
you
are
inclined
to
possess
landed
property
to
look
at
it
as
my
agent
informs
me
that
it
will
be
disposed
of
very
cheap
and
will
give
you
good
interest
for
your
money
mcelvina
had
long
wished
to
live
in
ireland
from
which
country
he
derived
his
descent
and
he
could
not
but
feel
that
some
untoward
recognition
might
possibly
take
place
in
such
a
place
of
numerous
resort
as
cheltenham
by
which
some
of
the
passages
in
his
early
career
might
be
exposed
this
appeared
to
be
a
chance
which
might
not
again
present
itself
and
he
gladly
consented
to
accompany
rainscourt
in
his
excursion
after
an
absence
of
three
weeks
they
returned
the
castle
had
been
fitted
out
in
a
style
of
lavish
expenditure
and
taste
and
rainscourt
could
find
little
to
improve
or
add
the
property
which
mcelvina
went
over
to
examine
suited
him
both
in
price
and
in
situation
and
having
consulted
his
wife
who
cordially
acquiesced
in
his
view
he
wrote
to
mr
rainscourt
agent
requesting
him
to
conclude
the
purchase
rainscourt
now
determined
upon
making
his
last
effort
for
a
resumption
of
marital
rights
having
introduced
the
conversation
by
stating
in
minute
detail
the
alterations
and
improvements
which
he
had
made
at
the
castle
he
then
informed
mrs
rainscourt
that
he
had
been
to
that
expense
in
the
hope
that
she
would
take
possession
of
it
for
the
remainder
of
the
autumn
if
said
he
you
knew
the
pleasure
it
would
give
me
once
more
to
see
you
surrounded
with
every
luxury
in
the
place
where
we
formerly
resided
in
poverty
if
you
knew
the
joy
which
your
presence
would
diffuse
among
your
affectionate
tenants
and
the
anxiety
with
which
they
are
expecting
your
appearance
for
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
promised
them
that
you
should
gladden
them
with
your
return
you
would
not
refuse
the
request
i
have
made
but
rainscourt
had
not
calculated
well
if
there
was
any
spot
of
which
the
reminiscences
were
peculiarly
painful
to
his
wife
it
was
the
castle
in
galway
it
was
there
that
she
had
been
treated
with
severity
and
contempt
it
was
there
that
she
had
been
cruelly
deserted
by
her
husband
when
he
was
restored
to
affluence
with
the
bitter
feelings
attendant
upon
these
recollections
mrs
rainscourt
penetrated
into
the
motives
which
had
induced
her
husband
to
act
and
the
balance
was
more
than
ever
against
his
cause
if
you
have
fitted
up
the
castle
to
oblige
me
mr
rainscourt
i
return
you
my
grateful
thanks
for
your
kindness
and
consideration
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
could
enter
the
castle
with
pleasure
there
are
so
many
more
painful
than
agreeable
remembrances
connected
with
it
that
i
had
rather
decline
going
there
the
more
so
as
i
consider
it
too
secluded
for
emily
but
not
too
secluded
mrs
rainscourt
replied
her
husband
dropping
on
one
knee
for
me
to
beseech
pardon
for
my
errors
and
prove
the
sincerity
of
my
repentance
let
me
conjure
you
to
allow
it
to
be
the
scene
of
the
renewal
of
my
love
and
my
admiration
as
it
unfortunately
was
of
my
folly
and
indifference
mr
rainscourt
this
interview
must
be
decisive
know
once
for
all
that
such
a
reconciliation
as
you
would
desire
never
can
or
shall
take
place
spare
me
the
pain
of
recapitulation
it
is
enough
to
say
that
once
thrown
from
you
i
can
not
nor
will
not
be
resumed
at
your
pleasure
and
fantasy
although
injured
in
the
tenderest
point
i
forgive
all
that
has
passed
and
shall
be
happy
to
receive
you
as
a
friend
in
private
as
well
as
in
public
but
all
attempts
to
obtain
more
will
only
meet
with
mortification
and
defeat
rise
mr
rainscourt
take
my
hand
in
friendship
it
is
offered
with
cordiality
but
if
you
again
resume
the
subject
of
this
meeting
i
shall
be
forced
to
deny
myself
to
you
when
you
call
rainscourt
turned
pale
as
he
complied
with
her
request
he
had
humiliated
himself
to
no
purpose
mortified
pride
mingled
with
rejected
passion
formed
a
compound
of
deadly
hate
which
raged
with
fury
against
the
late
object
of
his
desire
he
commanded
himself
sufficiently
to
stammer
out
his
regrets
and
promised
not
again
to
introduce
the
subject
and
lifting
up
the
offered
hand
respectfully
to
his
lips
he
quitted
her
presence
to
meditate
upon
revenge
the
liberal
settlements
which
he
had
made
at
the
time
of
separation
were
too
firmly
secured
to
be
withheld
to
remove
his
daughter
was
the
next
idea
which
presented
itself
but
that
could
not
be
effected
emily
was
of
a
resolute
disposition
and
would
not
consent
to
leave
her
mother
and
an
appeal
to
chancery
would
show
how
unfit
a
person
he
was
to
have
the
responsible
charge
of
a
young
woman
the
night
was
passed
in
anxious
meditation
and
before
the
morning
his
plans
were
arranged
nothing
could
be
accomplished
by
force
he
must
therefore
resort
to
address
he
would
be
more
than
ever
attentive
and
trust
to
time
and
opportunity
for
the
gratification
of
his
revenge
the
parties
continued
at
cheltenham
and
mr
rainscourt
following
up
his
plan
made
an
avowal
to
his
wife
that
he
had
now
abandoned
all
hopes
of
success
and
would
not
importune
her
any
more
he
only
requested
that
she
would
receive
him
on
those
terms
of
intimacy
in
which
consisted
the
present
happiness
of
his
life
mrs
rainscourt
who
although
she
had
resolution
sufficient
to
refuse
him
felt
great
struggles
in
her
own
mind
to
decide
the
victory
in
favour
of
prudence
now
leaned
more
favourably
towards
her
husband
than
before
his
assiduity
for
years
his
indifference
to
money
in
fitting
up
the
castle
to
please
her
his
humiliation
when
he
kneeled
to
her
his
subsequent
humble
expressions
of
regret
his
polite
attention
notwithstanding
his
repulse
and
added
to
all
these
her
gratified
pride
all
tended
to
soften
her
heart
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
in
a
few
months
she
would
have
thought
him
sufficiently
punished
to
have
acceded
to
his
wishes
but
it
was
fated
to
be
otherwise
one
morning
rainscourt
called
in
his
curricle
and
as
the
horses
stood
at
the
door
champing
their
bits
and
tossing
their
heads
as
they
were
held
by
the
dismounted
grooms
mrs
rainscourt
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
with
her
husband
and
whose
heart
was
fast
warming
towards
him
for
the
tide
once
turned
the
flow
of
affection
is
rapid
playfully
observed
mr
rainscourt
you
often
take
emily
out
with
you
in
your
curricle
but
you
have
never
offered
to
take
me
i
presume
you
think
that
i
am
too
old
indeed
mrs
rainscourt
if
i
had
thought
that
you
would
have
ventured
emily
would
not
so
often
have
been
seated
at
my
side
if
not
too
late
and
you
will
pardon
my
negligence
oblige
me
by
permitting
me
to
drive
you
now
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
do
so
but
as
married
ladies
have
been
from
time
immemorial
forced
from
the
field
by
their
daughters
i
believe
i
shall
submit
to
the
affront
and
accept
your
offer
i
feel
much
flattered
replied
he
by
your
kind
acquiescence
but
you
must
allow
me
to
desire
my
grooms
to
take
these
horses
out
and
put
the
others
to
which
are
much
quieter
it
will
be
a
delay
of
only
a
few
minutes
mrs
rainscourt
smiled
and
quitted
the
room
to
prepare
for
her
excursion
while
rainscourt
descended
to
the
street
door
william
drive
to
the
stables
take
these
horses
out
and
put
in
the
two
others
the
others
sir
replied
the
man
with
surprise
what
smolensko
and
yes
be
smart
and
bring
them
round
as
soon
as
you
can
why
sir
the
two
young
have
never
been
in
together
yet
smolensko
but
a
rum
customer
when
aside
of
a
steady
horse
and
as
for
he
jibs
just
as
bad
as
ever
never
mind
put
them
in
and
bring
them
round
then
i
better
tie
up
the
dog
sir
for
they
ca
neither
of
them
abide
him
never
mind
they
must
be
accustomed
to
him
so
let
the
dog
follow
as
usual
be
quick
and
rainscourt
returned
to
the
house
sam
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
fancy
what
master
at
today
said
william
who
had
delivered
his
horse
over
to
the
other
groom
and
had
mounted
the
curricle
to
drive
it
to
the
stable
if
he
means
to
drive
them
two
devils
together
there
no
road
in
england
wide
enough
for
him
i
sure
i
ca
tell
replied
the
other
no
man
in
his
senses
would
do
it
unless
indeed
he
going
to
drive
his
wife
why
hardly
that
for
they
say
he
wants
to
marry
her
again
marry
his
wife
again
no
no
bill
master
too
wide
awake
for
that
the
curricle
at
the
door
rainscourt
handed
in
his
wife
and
the
horses
set
off
tightly
reined
by
rainscourt
and
flying
to
and
fro
from
the
pole
so
as
to
alarm
mrs
rainscourt
who
expressed
a
wish
to
alight
they
are
only
fresh
at
first
starting
my
dear
they
will
be
quiet
directly
look
there
observed
one
of
the
promenaders
there
rainscourt
driving
his
wife
in
the
curricle
oh
then
the
bull
has
arrived
you
may
depend
upon
it
as
they
spoke
the
dog
made
a
spring
at
the
horses
heads
they
plunged
violently
and
shortly
after
set
off
at
full
speed
rainscourt
could
not
have
stopped
them
if
he
had
wished
it
but
the
fact
was
that
he
had
entered
the
curricle
determined
to
hazard
his
own
life
rather
than
not
gratify
his
revenge
all
that
was
left
for
him
was
to
guide
them
and
this
he
did
so
that
the
near
wheel
came
in
contact
with
a
post
the
horses
with
the
pole
and
broken
traces
continued
their
rapid
career
leaving
rainscourt
his
wife
and
the
fragments
of
the
vehicle
in
the
road
rainscourt
plan
had
been
successful
although
much
contused
by
the
fall
he
was
not
severely
injured
mrs
rainscourt
who
had
been
thrown
out
with
more
violence
over
the
head
of
her
husband
was
taken
up
with
a
fractured
skull
and
in
a
few
minutes
breathed
her
last
chapter
forty
eight
oh
for
a
power
to
chant
thy
praise
hypocrisy
oh
for
a
hymn
loud
as
the
virtues
thou
dost
loudly
vaunt
not
practise
byron
hypocrisy
the
calling
the
only
that
rings
all
in
a
gift

is
not
only
able

domineer

the
rabble

empowered

rout

and

that
the
wickedness
and
hypocrisy
of
the
individual
may
be
forgotten
in
the
absurdity
of
the
scene
the
grooms
made
no
scruple
after
the
catastrophe
to
state
all
that
had
passed
between
them
and
their
master
it
was
spread
through
cheltenham
with
the
usual
rapidity
of
all
scandal
in
a
place
where
people
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
talk
about
each
other
the
only
confutation
which
the
report
received
was
the
conduct
of
mr
rainscourt
he
was
positively
inconsolable
he
threw
himself
upon
the
remains
declaring
that
nothing
should
separate
him
from
his
dear
dear
clara
the
honest
old
curate
who
had
attended
mrs
rainscourt
in
her
last
moments
had
great
difficulty
with
the
assistance
of
the
men
servants
in
removing
him
to
another
chamber
on
the
ensuing
day
some
declared
that
he
repented
of
his
unkind
behaviour
and
that
he
was
struck
with
remorse
the
females
observed
that
men
never
knew
the
value
of
a
wife
until
they
lost
her
others
thought
his
grief
was
all
humbug
although
they
acknowledged
at
the
same
time
that
they
could
not
find
out
any
interested
motives
to
induce
him
to
act
such
a
part
but
when
mr
rainscourt
insisted
that
the
heart
of
the
deceased
should
be
embalmed
and
directed
it
to
be
enshrined
in
an
urn
of
massive
gold
then
all
cheltenham
began
to
think
that
he
was
sincere
at
least
all
the
ladies
did
and
the
gentlemen
married
or
single
were
either
too
wise
or
too
polite
to
offer
any
negative
remark
when
his
conduct
was
pronounced
to
be
a
pattern
for
all
husbands
moreover
mr
potts
the
curate
vouched
for
his
sincerity
in
consequence
of
the
handsome
gratuity
which
he
had
received
for
consigning
mrs
rainscourt
to
the
vault
and
the
liberal
largess
to
the
poor
upon
the
same
occasion
how
could
any
man
prove
his
sincerity
more
thought
mr
potts
who
blinded
by
gratitude
forgot
that
although
in
affliction
our
hearts
are
softened
towards
the
miseries
of
others
on
the
other
hand
we
are
quite
as
if
not
more
liberal
when
intoxicated
with
good
fortune
be
it
as
it
may
the
conduct
of
mr
rainscourt
was
pronounced
most
exemplary
all
hints
and
surmises
of
former
variance
were
voted
scandalous
and
all
cheltenham
talked
of
nothing
but
the
dead
mrs
rainscourt
the
living
mr
rainscourt
the
heart
and
the
magnificent
gold
urn
have
you
heard
how
poor
mr
rainscourt
is
was
the
usual
question
at
the
pump
as
the
ladies
congregated
to
pour
down
number
or
number
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
medical
humbugs
more
resigned
they
say
he
was
seen
walking
after
dark
was
he
indeed
to
the
churchyard
of
course
poor
dear
man
miss
emily
maid
told
my
abigail
last
night
that
she
looks
quite
beautiful
in
her
mourning
but
i
suppose
she
will
not
come
on
the
promenade
again
before
she
leaves
cheltenham
she
ought
not
replied
a
young
lady
who
did
not
much
approve
of
so
handsome
an
heiress
remaining
at
cheltenham
it
will
be
very
incorrect
if
she
does
some
one
ought
to
tell
her
so
with
the
exception
of
mr
potts
no
one
had
dared
to
break
in
upon
the
solitude
of
mr
rainscourt
who
had
remained
the
whole
day
upon
the
sofa
with
the
urn
on
the
table
before
him
and
the
shutters
closed
to
exclude
the
light
the
worthy
curate
called
upon
him
every
evening
renewing
his
topics
of
consolation
and
pointing
out
the
duty
of
christian
resignation
a
deep
sigh
a
heavy
ah
or
a
long
drawn
oh
were
all
the
variety
of
answers
that
could
be
obtained
for
some
days
but
time
does
wonders
and
mr
rainscourt
at
last
inclined
an
ear
to
the
news
of
the
day
and
listened
with
marked
attention
to
the
answers
which
he
elicited
from
the
curate
by
his
indirect
questions
as
to
what
the
world
said
about
him
come
come
mr
rainscourt
do
not
indulge
your
grief
any
more
excess
becomes
criminal
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
so
and
yours
to
attend
to
me
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
you
will
immediately
return
to
the
world
and
its
amusements
but
as
there
must
be
a
beginning
why
not
come
and
take
your
family
dinner
with
mrs
potts
and
me
now
let
me
persuade
you
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
we
dine
at
five
a
hot
joint
nothing
more
rainscourt
who
was
rather
tired
of
solitude
refused
in
such
a
way
as
to
induce
the
worthy
curate
to
reiterate
his
invitation
and
at
length
with
great
apparent
unwillingness
consented
the
curate
sat
with
him
until
the
dinner
hour
when
leaning
on
the
pastor
arm
rainscourt
walked
down
the
street
in
all
the
trappings
of
his
woe
and
his
eyes
never
once
raised
from
the
ground
there
mr
rainscourt
there
mr
rainscourt
whispered
some
of
the
promenaders
who
were
coming
up
the
street
no
that
not
him
yes
it
is
walking
with
mr
potts
do
you
see
his
beautiful
large
dog
following
him
he
never
walks
without
it
a
it
a
beauty
a
polygar
dog
from
the
east
indies
his
name
is
tippoo
the
house
of
the
curate
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
lodgings
occupied
by
mr
rainscourt
they
soon
entered
and
were
hid
from
the
prying
eyes
of
the
idle
and
the
curious
i
have
persuaded
mr
rainscourt
to
come
and
take
a
family
dinner
with
us
my
dear
quite
delighted
to
see
him
replied
mrs
potts
casting
a
sidelong
angry
glance
at
her
husband
mr
rainscourt
made
a
slight
bow
and
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
as
if
the
light
was
hideous
mrs
potts
took
the
opportunity
of
escaping
by
the
door
beckoning
to
her
husband
as
soon
as
she
was
outside
and
i
will
go
and
decant
the
quite
in
the
family
way
mr
rainscourt
no
ceremony
you
excuse
me
continued
the
curate
as
he
obeyed
the
summons
of
his
wife
like
a
ordered
up
to
be
well
my
dear
interrogated
mr
potts
humbly
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
but
mrs
potts
made
no
reply
until
she
had
led
her
husband
to
such
a
distance
from
the
parlour
as
she
imagined
would
prevent
mr
rainscourt
from
being
roused
by
the
high
pitch
to
which
she
intended
to
raise
her
voice
i
do
declare
mr
potts
you
are
a
complete
saturday
all
the
maids
washing
and
ask
him
to
dinner
there
positively
nothing
to
eat
it
really
is
too
provoking
well
my
dear
what
does
it
matter
the
poor
man
will
in
all
probability
not
eat
a
bit
he
is
so
overcome
so
replied
the
lady
grief
never
hurts
the
appetite
mr
potts
on
the
contrary
people
care
more
then
about
a
good
dinner
than
at
other
times
it
the
only
enjoyment
they
can
have
without
being
accused
by
the
world
of
want
of
feeling
well
you
know
better
than
i
my
dear
but
i
really
think
that
if
you
were
to
die
i
could
not
eat
a
bit
and
i
tell
you
mr
potts
i
could
if
you
were
to
die
so
stupid
of
you
sally
run
and
take
off
the
tablecloth
it
quite
dirty
put
on
one
of
the
fine
damask
they
will
be
very
large
for
the
table
never
mind
be
quick
and
step
next
door
and
ask
the
old
german
to
come
in
and
wait
at
table
he
shall
have
a
pint
of
strong
beer
sally
did
as
she
was
bid
mr
potts
whose
wine
had
been
decanted
long
before
and
mrs
potts
who
had
vented
her
spleen
upon
her
husband
returned
into
the
parlour
together
my
dear
mr
potts
is
so
particular
about
decanting
his
wine
observed
the
lady
with
a
gracious
smile
as
she
entered
he
is
so
long
about
it
and
scolds
me
so
if
ever
i
wish
to
do
it
for
him
mr
potts
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
last
accusation
but
as
he
had
long
been
drilled
he
laughed
assent
a
tedious
during
which
the
lady
had
all
the
conversation
to
herself
for
the
curate
answered
only
in
monosyllabic
compliance
and
rainscourt
made
no
answer
whatever
elapsed
before
dinner
was
announced
by
the
german
mercenary
who
had
been
subsidised
meinheer
de
dinner
was
upon
de
table
come
mr
rainscourt
said
the
curate
in
a
persuasive
tone
rainscourt
got
up
and
without
offering
his
arm
to
the
lady
who
had
her
own
bowed
out
in
readiness
stalked
out
of
the
room
by
the
side
of
mr
potts
followed
by
his
wife
who
by
her
looks
seemed
to
imply
that
she
considered
that
the
demise
of
one
woman
was
no
excuse
for
a
breach
of
politeness
towards
another
the
covers
were
removed
two
small
soles
much
for
three
people
and
a
dish
of
potatoes
will
you
allow
me
to
offer
you
a
little
sole
mr
rainscourt
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
a
very
poor
dinner
rainscourt
bowed
in
the
negative
and
the
soles
disappeared
in
a
very
short
time
between
the
respective
organs
of
mastication
of
mr
and
mrs
potts
the
dishes
of
the
first
course
were
removed
and
the
german
appeared
with
a
covered
dish
followed
by
sally
who
brought
some
vegetables
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
for
more
i
afraid
you
will
have
a
very
poor
dinner
repeated
the
take
off
the
cover
will
you
allow
me
to
help
you
to
a
piece
of
this
rainscourt
turned
his
head
round
to
see
if
the
object
offered
was
such
as
to
tempt
his
appetite
and
beheld
a
bullock
my
wife
my
wife
exclaimed
he
as
he
darted
from
his
chair
and
covering
his
face
as
if
to
hide
from
his
sight
the
object
which
occasioned
the
concatenation
of
ideas
attempted
to
run
out
of
the
room
but
his
escape
was
not
so
easy
in
his
hurried
movement
he
had
entangled
himself
with
the
long
that
trailed
on
the
carpet
and
to
the
dismay
of
the
party
everything
that
was
on
the
table
was
swept
off
in
his
retreat
and
as
he
had
blindfolded
himself
he
ran
with
such
force
against
the
german
who
was
in
the
act
of
receiving
a
dish
from
sally
that
precipitating
him
against
her
they
both
rolled
prostrate
on
the
floor
ah
mein
got
mein
got
roared
the
german
as
his
face
was
smothered
with
the
hot
stewed
peas
a
dish
of
which
he
was
carrying
as
he
fell
on
his
back
oh
my
eye
my
eye
bellowed
sally
as
she
rolled
upon
the
floor
my
wife
my
wife
reiterated
rainscourt
as
he
trampled
over
them
and
secured
his
retreat
and
oh
my
dinner
my
dinner
ejaculated
the
curate
as
he
surveyed
the
general
wreck
and
oh
you
fool
you
fool
mr
potts
echoed
the
lady
with
her
arms
akimbo
to
ask
such
a
man
to
dine
with
you
well
i
had
no
idea
that
he
could
have
taken
it
so
much
to
replied
the
curate
meekly
but
we
must
follow
rainscourt
who
whether
really
agitated
by
the
circumstance
or
aware
that
it
would
be
bruited
abroad
thought
that
a
display
of
agitation
would
be
advisable
proceeded
with
hurried
steps
to
the
promenades
where
he
glided
through
the
thoughtless
crowd
with
the
silent
rapidity
of
a
ghost
having
sufficiently
awakened
the
curiosity
of
the
spectators
he
sank
down
on
one
of
the
most
retired
benches
with
his
eyes
for
some
time
thrown
up
in
contemplation
of
the
fleecy
clouds
beyond
which
kind
spirits
are
supposed
to
look
down
and
weep
over
the
follies
and
inconsistencies
of
an
erring
world
casting
his
eyes
to
earth
he
beheld
horror
upon
horrors
the
detested
bullock
heart
which
his
great
polygar
dog
had
seized
during
the
confusion
of
the
dinner
scene
and
had
followed
him
out
with
it
in
his
mouth
finding
it
too
hot
to
carry
immediately
after
its
seizure
he
had
for
a
time
laid
it
down
and
had
just
arrived
with
it
there
he
was
not
a
foot
from
the
bench
his
jaws
distended
with
the
prize
tossing
up
his
head
as
if
in
mockery
of
his
master
and
wagging
his
long
feathered
tail
rainscourt
again
made
a
precipitate
retreat
to
his
own
lodgings
accompanied
by
the
faithful
animal
who
delighted
at
the
unusual
rapidity
of
his
master
movements
bounded
before
him
with
his
treasure
of
which
he
was
much
too
polite
to
think
of
making
a
repast
until
a
more
seasonable
opportunity
rainscourt
knocked
at
the
door
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
the
dog
bounced
up
before
him
entering
the
chamber
of
woe
and
crouching
under
the
table
upon
which
the
golden
urn
was
placed
with
the
heart
between
his
paws
saluted
his
master
with
a
rap
or
two
of
his
tail
on
the
carpet
and
commenced
his
dinner
the
servant
was
summoned
and
rainscourt
without
looking
at
either
the
urn
the
dog
or
the
man
cried
in
an
angry
tone
take
that
heart
and
throw
it
away
immediately
sir
replied
the
domestic
with
astonishment
who
did
not
observe
the
dog
and
his
occupation
throw
it
away
immediately
sir
do
you
hear
yes
sir
replied
the
man
taking
the
urn
from
the
table
and
quitting
the
room
with
it
muttering
to
himself
as
he
descended
the
stairs
i
thought
it
would
last
long
having
obeyed
his
supposed
instructions
he
returned
if
you
please
sir
where
am
i
to
put
the
piece
of
plate
the
piece
of
plate
rainscourt
turned
round
and
beheld
the
vacant
urn
it
was
too
much
that
evening
he
ordered
the
horses
and
left
cheltenham
for
ever
various
were
the
reports
of
the
subsequent
week
some
said
that
the
fierce
dog
had
broken
open
the
urn
and
devoured
the
embalmed
heart
some
told
one
story
some
another
and
before
the
week
was
over
all
the
stories
had
become
incomprehensible
in
one
point
they
all
agreed
that
mr
rainscourt
grief
was
all
humbug
is
well
thou
hast
thy
spiriting
gently
or
for
thy
tardy
coming
i
would
have
sentenced
thee
to
the
task
of
infusing
thy
spirit
into
the
consistent
eldon
or
into
arthur
duke
of
wellington
where
like
a
viper
at
a
file
thou
shouldest
have
tortured
thyself
in
vain
note
bustle
i
am
not
certain
whether
i
spell
this
modern
invention
correctly
if
not
i
must
plead
ignorance
i
have
asked
several
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
who
declare
that
they
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
which
perhaps
the
reader
will
agree
with
me
is
all
humbug
chapter
forty
nine
there
leviathan
hugest
of
living
creatures

or

milton
congratulate
me
reader
that
notwithstanding
i
have
been
beating
against
wind
and
tide
that
is
to
say
writing
this
book
through
all
the
rolling
and
pitching
headache
and
indigestion
incident
to
the
confined
and
unnatural
life
of
a
sailor
i
have
arrived
at
my
last
chapter
you
may
be
surprised
at
this
assertion
finding
yourself
in
the
middle
of
the
third
volume
but
such
is
the
fact
doubtless
you
have
imagined
that
according
to
the
usual
method
i
had
begun
at
the
beginning
and
would
have
finished
at
the
end
had
i
done
so
this
work
would
not
have
been
so
near
to
a
close
as
thank
heaven
it
is
at
present
at
times
i
have
been
gay
at
others
sad
and
i
am
obliged
to
write
according
to
my
humour
which
as
variable
as
the
wind
seldom
continues
in
one
direction
i
have
proceeded
with
this
book
as
i
should
do
if
i
had
had
to
build
a
ship
the
dimensions
of
every
separate
piece
of
timber
i
knew
by
the
which
lay
before
me
it
therefore
made
no
difference
upon
which
i
began
as
they
all
were
to
be
cut
out
before
i
bolted
them
together
i
should
have
taken
them
just
as
they
came
to
hand
and
sorted
them
for
their
respective
uses
my
keel
is
laid
on
the
slips
and
my
stern
is
raised
these
will
do
for
futtocks
these
for
beams
i
lay
those
aside
for
riders
and
out
of
these
gnarled
and
twisted
pieces
of
oak
i
select
my
knees
it
is
of
little
consequence
on
which
my
adze
is
first
employed
thus
it
was
that
a
fit
of
melancholy
produced
the
last
half
of
the
third
volume
and
my
transoms
and
were
framed
out
almost
before
my
were
laid
but
you
will
perceive
that
this
is
of
no
consequence
all
are
now
bolted
together
and
with
the
exception
of
a
little
dubbing
away
here
and
there
a
little
gingerbread
work
and
a
coat
of
paint
she
is
ready
for
launching
now
all
is
give
me
the
bottle
of
wine
and
as
she
rushes
into
the
sea
of
public
opinion
upon
which
her
merits
are
to
be
ascertained
i
christen
her
the
own
and
now
that
she
is
afloat
i
must
candidly
acknowledge
that
i
am
not
exactly
pleased
with
her
to
speak
technically
her
is
not
thrown
out
enough
to
translate
this
observation
into
plain
english
i
find
on
turning
over
the
different
chapters
that
my
hero
as
i
have
often
designated
him
is
not
sufficiently
the
hero
of
my
tale
as
soon
as
he
is
shipped
on
board
of
a
he
becomes
as
insignificant
as
a
midshipman
must
unavoidably
be
from
his
humble
situation
i
see
the
error
yet
i
can
not
correct
it
without
overthrowing
all
rules
and
regulations
which
i
can
not
persuade
myself
to
do
even
in
a
work
of
fiction
trammelled
as
i
am
by
the
service
i
can
only
plead
guilty
to
what
it
is
impossible
to
amend
without
commencing
for
everything
and
everybody
must
find
their
level
on
board
of
a
ship
well
i
one
comfort
left
sir
walter
scott
has
never
succeeded
in
making
a
hero
or
in
other
words
his
best
characters
are
not
those
which
commonly
go
under
the
designation
of
the
hero
i
am
afraid
there
is
something
irreclaimably
insipid
in
these
but
i
must
go
in
search
of
the
there
she
is
with
set
about
fifty
miles
to
the
northward
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
i
think
that
when
the
reader
has
finished
this
chapter
he
will
be
inclined
to
surmise
that
the
author
as
well
as
the
has
most
decidedly
doubled
the
cape
the
frigate
was
standing
her
course
before
a
light
breeze
at
the
rate
of
four
or
five
knots
an
hour
and
captain
m
was
standing
at
the
break
of
the
gangway
talking
with
the
when
the
man
stationed
at
the
called
out
a
rock
on
the
the
telemaque
shoal
which
is
supposed
to
exist
somewhere
to
the
southward
of
the
cape
but
whose
situation
has
never
been
ascertained
had
just
before
been
the
subject
of
their
conversation
startled
at
the
intelligence
captain
m
ordered
the
to
be
taken
in
and
hailing
the
man
at
the
inquired
how
far
the
rock
was
distant
from
the
ship
i
can
see
it
off
the
answered
pearce
the
master
who
had
immediately
ascended
the
rigging
upon
the
report
the
now
went
aloft
and
soon
brought
it
down
to
the
lower
ratlines
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
distinctly
seen
from
the
deck
of
the
frigate
the
ship
course
was
altered
three
or
four
points
that
no
risk
might
be
incurred
and
captain
m
directing
the
people
aloft
to
keep
a
sharp
for
any
change
in
the
colour
of
the
water
continued
to
near
the
supposed
danger
in
a
slanting
direction
the
rock
appeared
to
be
about
six
or
seven
feet
above
the
water
edge
with
a
base
of
four
or
five
feet
in
diameter
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
parties
there
was
no
apparent
change
in
colour
to
indicate
that
they
shoaled
their
water
and
it
was
not
until
they
within
two
cables
length
and
the
cutter
was
ordered
to
be
cleared
away
to
examine
it
that
they
perceived
that
the
object
of
their
scrutiny
was
in
motion
this
was
now
evident
and
in
a
direction
crossing
the
stern
of
the
ship
i
think
that
it
is
some
kind
of
fish
observed
seymour
i
saw
it
raise
its
tail
a
little
out
of
the
water
and
such
it
proved
to
be
as
it
shortly
afterwards
passed
the
ship
within
half
a
cable
length
it
was
a
large
spermaceti
whale
on
the
head
of
which
some
disease
had
formed
an
enormous
spongy
excrescence
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
rock
and
was
so
buoyant
that
although
the
animal
made
several
attempts
as
it
approached
the
ship
it
could
not
sink
under
water
captain
m
satisfied
that
it
really
was
as
we
have
described
again
made
sail
and
pursued
his
course
it
is
very
strange
and
very
important
observed
he
that
a
disease
of
any
description
can
scarcely
be
confined
to
one
individual
but
must
pervade
the
whole
species
this
circumstance
may
account
for
the
many
rocks
reported
to
have
been
seen
in
various
parts
of
the
southern
hemisphere
and
which
have
never
been
afterwards
fallen
in
with
a
more
complete
deception
i
never
witnessed
had
we
hauled
off
sooner
and
not
have
examined
it
i
should
have
had
no
hesitation
in
asserting
most
confidently
that
we
had
seen
a
rock
answered
the
captain
m
went
below
and
was
soon
after
at
table
with
the
and
macallan
who
had
been
invited
to
dine
in
the
cabin
after
dinner
the
subject
was
again
introduced
i
have
my
doubts
sir
observed
the
whether
i
shall
ever
venture
to
tell
the
story
in
england
i
never
should
be
believed
vrai
pas
toujours
le
answered
captain
m
and
i
am
afraid
that
too
often
a
great
illiberality
is
shown
towards
travellers
who
after
having
encountered
great
difficulties
and
dangers
have
the
mortification
not
to
be
credited
upon
their
return
although
credulity
is
to
be
guarded
against
i
do
not
know
a
greater
proof
of
ignorance
than
refusing
to
believe
anything
because
it
does
not
exactly
coincide
with
one
own
ideas
the
more
confined
these
may
be
from
want
of
education
or
knowledge
the
more
incredulous
people
are
apt
to
become
two
of
the
most
enterprising
travellers
of
modern
days
bruce
and
le
vaillant
were
ridiculed
and
discredited
upon
their
return
subsequent
travellers
who
went
the
same
track
as
the
former
with
a
view
to
confute
were
obliged
to
corroborate
his
assertions
and
all
who
have
followed
the
latter
have
acknowledged
the
correctness
of
his
statements
your
observations
remind
me
of
the
story
of
the
old
woman
and
her
grandson
replied
the
you
recollect
it
i
presume
indeed
i
do
not
said
captain
m
pray
favour
me
with
it
the
then
narrated
with
a
considerable
degree
of
humour
the
following
story
a
lad
who
had
been
some
years
at
sea
returned
home
to
his
aged
grandmother
who
was
naturally
curious
to
hear
his
jack
said
the
old
woman
me
all
you
seen
and
tell
me
the
most
wonderful
things
first
granny
when
we
were
in
the
red
sea
we
anchored
close
to
the
shore
and
when
we
hove
the
anchor
up
there
was
a
chariot
wheel
hanging
to
it
jack
pharaoh
and
his
host
were
drowned
in
the
red
sea
you
know
that
proves
the
bible
is
all
true
well
jack
and
what
else
did
you
see
granny
when
i
was
in
the
west
indies
i
saw
whole
mountains
of
sugar
and
the
rivers
between
them
were
all
rum
true
said
the
old
woman
smacking
her
lips
get
all
the
sugar
and
rum
from
there
you
know
pray
jack
did
you
ever
see
a
mermaid
no
mother
but
i
seen
a
merman
let
hear
jack
mother
when
we
anchored
to
the
northward
of
kitt
one
sunday
morning
a
voice
called
us
from
alongside
and
when
we
looked
over
there
was
a
merman
just
come
to
the
top
of
the
water
he
stroked
down
his
hair
and
touched
it
as
we
do
our
hats
to
the
captain
and
told
him
that
he
would
feel
much
obliged
to
him
to
trip
his
anchor
as
it
had
been
let
go
just
before
the
door
of
his
house
below
which
they
could
not
open
in
consequence
and
his
wife
would
be
too
late
to
go
to
church
bless
me
says
the
old
woman
they
christians
i
do
declare
and
now
jack
tell
me
something
more
jack
whose
invention
was
probably
exhausted
then
told
her
that
he
had
seen
hundreds
of
fish
flying
in
the
air
come
jack
said
the
old
woman
you
me
attempt
to
put
such
stories
off
on
your
old
granny
the
chariot
wheel
i
can
believe
because
it
is
likely
the
sugar
and
rum
i
know
to
be
true
and
also
the
merman
for
i
have
seen
pictures
of
them
but
as
for
fish
flying
in
the
air
jack
that
a
lie
excellent
said
captain
m
then
the
only
part
that
was
true
she
rejected
believing
all
the
monstrous
lies
that
he
had
coined
if
any
unknown
individual
observed
macallan
and
not
captain
cook
had
reported
the
existence
of
such
an
animal
as
the
ornithorhynchus
or
platypus
without
bringing
home
the
specimen
as
a
proof
who
would
have
credited
his
statement
no
one
replied
captain
m
still
such
is
the
scepticism
of
the
present
age
that
travellers
must
be
content
with
having
justice
done
to
them
after
they
are
dead
that
but
cold
comfort
sir
replied
the
rising
from
the
table
which
movement
was
immediately
followed
by
the
remainder
of
the
guests
who
bowed
and
quitted
the
cabin
note
it
is
singular
that
the
almost
incredible
story
in
the
above
chapter
is
perhaps
the
only
real
fact
in
the
whole
book
it
will
be
found
in
the
log
of
the
ship
and
signed
by
all
the
officers
and
yet
many
of
my
readers
will
be
inclined
to
reject
this
and
believe
a
considerable
portion
of
the
remainder
of
the
composition
to
have
been
drawn
from
living
characters
if
so
they
will
be
like
the
old
woman
chapter
fifty
guiderius
had
upon
his
neck
a
mole
a
sanguine
star
this
is
he
who
hath
upon
him
still
that
stamp
shakespeare
when
mr
rainscourt
left
cheltenham
he
wrote
a
hasty
note
to
the
mcelvinas
requesting
that
they
would
take
charge
of
emily
whose
presence
would
be
necessary
at
the
hall
and
when
they
had
arranged
their
own
affairs
would
bring
her
with
them
over
to
ireland
where
it
was
his
intention
to
reside
for
some
time
a
few
days
after
rainscourt
had
quitted
cheltenham
emily
who
since
her
mother
death
had
remained
with
the
mcelvinas
was
accompanied
by
them
to
that
home
which
for
the
first
time
she
returned
to
with
regret
it
may
be
inquired
by
the
reader
whether
rainscourt
was
not
harassed
by
his
conscience
i
never
heard
that
he
showed
any
outward
signs
conscience
has
been
described
as
a
most
importunate
monitor
paying
no
respect
to
persons
and
making
cowards
of
us
all
now
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
judge
from
external
evidence
there
is
not
a
greater
courtier
than
conscience
it
is
true
that
when
in
adversity
he
upbraids
us
and
holds
up
the
catalogue
of
our
crimes
so
close
to
our
noses
that
we
can
not
help
reading
every
line
it
is
true
that
when
suffering
with
disease
and
terrified
with
the
idea
of
going
we
know
not
where
he
assails
the
enfeebled
mind
and
body
and
scares
away
the
little
resolution
we
have
left
but
in
the
heydey
of
youth
in
the
vigour
of
health
with
the
means
of
administering
to
our
follies
and
adding
daily
and
hourly
to
our
crimes
he
never
mentions
hell
to
ears
polite
in
fact
he
never
attacks
a
man
who
has
more
than
ten
thousand
a
year
like
a
london
tradesman
he
never
presents
his
bill
as
long
as
you
give
him
fresh
orders
that
will
increase
it
but
once
prove
yourself
to
be
cleaned
out
by
no
longer
swelling
the
amount
and
he
pounces
upon
you
and
demands
a
bond
upon
the
next
world
which
like
all
others
will
probably
be
found
very
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
to
liquidate
conscience
therefore
is
not
an
honest
sturdy
adviser
but
a
sneaking
scoundrel
who
allows
you
to
run
into
his
debt
never
caring
to
tell
you
as
a
caution
but
rather
concealing
your
bill
from
you
as
long
as
there
is
a
chance
of
your
increasing
its
length
satisfied
that
eventually
he
must
be
paid
in
some
shape
or
other
the
mcelvinas
who
could
not
leave
emily
by
herself
took
up
their
abode
at
the
hall
until
the
necessary
arrangements
had
been
completed
and
then
removed
with
her
to
the
cottage
that
they
might
attend
to
their
own
affairs
emily
was
deeply
affected
at
the
loss
of
her
mother
she
had
always
been
a
kind
and
indulgent
friend
who
had
treated
her
more
as
an
equal
than
as
one
subject
to
authority
and
control
the
mcelvinas
were
anxious
to
remove
emily
from
the
hall
where
every
object
that
presented
itself
formed
a
link
of
association
with
her
loss
and
trifles
in
themselves
would
occasion
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
from
the
affectionate
and
sorrowful
girl
and
she
may
be
pardoned
when
i
state
that
perhaps
the
bitterest
tears
which
were
shed
were
those
when
she
threw
herself
on
that
sofa
where
she
had
remained
after
the
abrupt
departure
of
william
seymour
the
vicar
hastened
to
offer
his
condolence
and
finding
that
emily
was
as
resigned
as
could
be
expected
after
a
long
visit
walked
out
with
mcelvina
that
he
might
have
a
more
detailed
account
of
the
unfortunate
event
mcelvina
related
it
circumstantially
but
without
communicating
the
suspicions
which
the
story
of
the
grooms
had
occasioned
for
he
was
aware
that
the
vicar
was
too
charitable
to
allow
anything
but
positive
evidence
to
be
of
weight
in
an
accusation
so
degrading
to
human
nature
it
is
strange
observed
the
vicar
very
gravely
but
it
seems
as
if
a
fatality
attended
the
possessors
of
this
splendid
estate
the
death
of
admiral
de
courcy
was
under
most
painful
circumstances
without
friend
or
relation
to
close
his
eyes
it
was
followed
by
that
of
his
immediate
heir
who
was
drowned
as
soon
almost
as
the
property
devolved
to
him
and
i
who
was
appointed
to
be
his
guardian
never
beheld
my
charge
now
we
have
another
violent
death
of
the
possessor
and
all
within
the
space
of
twelve
or
thirteen
years
you
have
probably
heard
something
of
the
singular
history
of
the
former
heir
to
the
estate
i
heard
you
state
that
he
was
drowned
at
sea
but
nothing
further
or
rather
supposed
to
be
for
we
never
had
proof
positive
he
was
sent
away
in
a
prize
which
never
was
heard
of
and
although
there
is
no
confirmation
of
the
fact
i
have
no
doubt
but
he
was
lost
i
do
not
know
when
i
was
so
much
distressed
as
at
the
death
of
that
child
there
was
a
peculiarity
of
incident
in
his
history
the
facts
of
which
i
have
not
as
yet
communicated
to
any
one
as
there
are
certain
points
which
even
distant
branches
of
the
family
may
wish
to
keep
concealed
yet
upon
a
promise
of
secrecy
mr
mcelvina
i
will
impart
them
to
you
the
promise
being
given
the
vicar
commenced
with
the
history
of
admiral
de
courcy
his
treatment
of
his
wife
and
children
the
unfortunate
marriage
and
more
unfortunate
demise
of
edward
peters
or
rather
of
edward
de
courcy
the
acknowledgment
of
his
grandson
by
admiral
de
courcy
on
his
the
account
of
adams
his
death
the
boy
being
sent
away
in
a
prize
and
drowned
at
sea
i
have
all
the
particulars
in
writing
continued
the
good
man
and
the
necessary
documents
and
his
identity
was
easy
to
be
proved
by
the
mark
of
the
imprinted
on
his
shoulder
by
old
adams
heavens
is
it
possible
exclaimed
mcelvina
grasping
the
arm
of
the
vicar
what
do
you
mean
mean
i
mean
that
the
boy
is
alive
has
been
in
your
company
within
the
last
two
years
that
boy
yes
that
boy
that
boy
is
william
seymour
merciful
god
how
inscrutable
are
thy
ways
exclaimed
the
vicar
with
astonishment
and
reverence
explain
to
me
my
dear
sir
how
can
you
establish
your
assertion
if
the
reader
will
refer
back
to
the
circumstance
of
the
vicar
calling
upon
captain
m
he
will
observe
that
upon
being
made
acquainted
with
the
loss
of
the
child
he
was
so
much
shocked
that
he
withdrew
without
imparting
the
particulars
to
one
who
was
a
perfect
stranger
and
on
the
other
hand
captain
m
when
seymour
again
made
his
appearance
after
an
interval
of
three
years
not
having
been
put
in
possession
of
these
facts
or
even
knowing
the
vicar
address
or
name
had
no
means
of
communicating
the
intelligence
of
the
boy
recovery
i
must
now
sir
said
mcelvina
to
the
vicar
return
the
confidence
which
you
have
placed
in
me
under
the
same
promise
of
secrecy
by
making
you
acquainted
with
some
particulars
of
my
former
life
at
which
i
acknowledge
i
have
reason
to
blush
and
which
nothing
but
the
interests
of
william
seymour
would
have
induced
me
to
disclose
mcelvina
then
acknowledged
his
having
formerly
been
engaged
in
smuggling
his
picking
up
the
boy
from
the
wreck
his
care
of
him
for
three
years
the
capture
of
his
vessel
by
captain
m
and
the
circumstances
that
had
induced
captain
m
to
take
the
boy
under
his
protection
the
mark
was
as
legible
as
ever
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
identity
being
satisfactorily
established
the
vicar
listened
to
the
narration
with
the
interest
which
it
deserved
and
acknowledged
his
conviction
of
the
clearness
of
the
evidence
by
observing
this
will
be
a
heavy
blow
to
our
dear
emily
not
a
very
heavy
one
i
imagine
replied
mcelvina
who
immediately
relieved
the
mind
of
the
worthy
man
by
communicating
the
attachment
between
them
and
the
honourable
behaviour
of
seymour
how
very
strange
this
is
replied
the
vicar
it
really
would
be
a
good
subject
for
a
novel
i
only
trust
that
like
all
inventions
of
the
kind
it
may
end
as
happily
i
trust
so
too
but
let
us
now
consider
what
must
be
done
i
should
advise
his
being
sent
for
immediately
and
so
should
i
but
i
expect
from
the
last
accounts
which
i
received
from
him
that
the
ship
will
have
left
her
station
to
return
home
before
our
letters
can
arrive
there
my
plan
is
to
keep
quiet
until
his
return
the
facts
are
known
and
can
be
established
by
us
alone
let
us
immediately
take
such
precautions
as
our
legal
advisers
my
think
requisite
that
proofs
may
not
be
wanting
in
case
of
our
sudden
demise
but
we
must
not
act
until
he
arrives
in
the
country
for
mr
rainscourt
is
a
difficult
and
dangerous
person
to
deal
with
you
are
right
replied
the
vicar
when
do
you
leave
this
house
for
ireland
in
a
few
days
but
i
shall
be
ready
to
appear
the
moment
that
i
hear
of
the
ship
arrival
in
the
meantime
i
shall
make
the
necessary
affidavits
in
case
of
accident
mcelvina
and
the
vicar
separated
mcelvina
like
a
dutiful
husband
communicated
the
joyful
intelligence
to
his
wife
and
his
wife
to
soothe
emily
under
her
affliction
although
she
kept
the
secret
now
talked
of
seymour
in
a
few
days
the
arrangements
were
made
the
cottage
was
put
into
an
agent
hands
to
be
disposed
of
and
quitting
with
regret
an
abode
in
which
they
had
passed
some
years
of
unalloyed
happiness
they
set
off
for
galway
where
they
found
rainscourt
on
their
arrival
consigning
his
daughter
to
his
care
they
removed
to
their
own
house
which
was
on
the
property
which
mcelvina
had
purchased
and
about
four
miles
distant
from
the
castle
mcelvina
name
was
a
passport
to
the
hearts
of
his
tenants
who
declared
that
the
head
of
the
house
had
come
unto
his
own
again
that
he
had
the
true
eye
of
the
mcelvinas
there
was
no
mistaking
for
no
other
family
had
such
an
eye
that
his
honour
had
gladdened
their
hearts
by
seeing
the
property
into
the
ould
family
again
as
ould
a
one
as
any
in
ould
ireland
mcelvina
like
a
wise
man
held
his
tongue
and
then
they
talked
of
their
misfortunes
of
the
bad
potato
crop
of
arrears
of
rent
one
demand
was
heaped
upon
another
until
mcelvina
was
ultimately
obliged
to
refer
them
all
to
the
agent
whom
he
requested
to
be
as
lenient
as
possible
emily
was
now
reinstated
in
the
castle
where
she
had
passed
the
first
years
of
her
existence
and
found
that
all
in
it
was
new
except
her
old
nurse
norah
the
contiguity
of
the
mcelvinas
was
a
source
of
comfort
to
her
for
she
could

the

companions
of

her
life
was
solitary
but
she
had
numerous
resources
within
herself
and
the
winter
passed
rapidly
away
in
the
spring
she
returned
to
london
with
her
father
who
proudly
introduced
his
daughter
many
were
the
solicitations
of
those
who
admired
her
person
or
her
purse
but
in
vain
her
heart
was
and
it
was
with
pleasure
that
she
returned
to
ireland
after
the
season
was
over
to
renew
her
intimacy
with
the
mcelvinas
and
to
cherish
in
her
solitude

dryden
three
days
after
the
had
taken
a
fresh
departure
from
the
western
isles
a
thick
fog
came
on
the
continuance
of
which
prevented
them
from
ascertaining
their
situation
by
the
chronometer
the
wind
which
blew
favourably
from
the
had
by
their
dead
reckoning
driven
them
as
far
north
as

latitude
of

without
their
once
having
had
an
opportunity
of
finding
out
the
precise
situation
of

the

now
shifted

to

and
increasing
to
a
gale
captain
m
determined
upon
making
cape
clear
on
the
southern
coast
of
ireland
but
having
obtained
sights
for
the
chronometers
it
was
discovered
that
they
were
far
to
the
westward
of
the
reckoning
and
had
no
chance
of
making
the
point
of
land
which
they
had
intended
for
many
days
they
had
to
contend
against
strong
easterly
gales
with
a
heavy
sea
and
had
sought
shelter
under
the
western
coast
of
ireland
the
weather
moderating
and
the
wind
veering
again
to
the
southward
the
frigate
head
was
put
towards
the
shore
that
they
might
take
a
fresh
departure
but
scarcely
had
they
time
to
congratulate
themselves
upon
the
prospect
of
soon
gaining
a
port
when
there
was
every
appearance
of
another
gale
coming
on
from
the
as
this
was
from
a
quarter
which
in
all
probability
would
scarcely
allow
the
frigate
to
weather
she
was
hauled
off
on
the
larboard
tack
and
all
sail
put
on
her
which
prudence
would
permit
in
the
heavy
cross
sea
which
had
not
yet
subsided
we
shall
have
it
all
back
again
i
am
afraid
sir
observed
the
master
looking
to
windward
at
the
horizon
which
black
as
pitch
served
as
a
background
to
relieve
the
white
curling
tops
of
the
seas
shall
we
have
the
trysails
up
and
bend
them
the
boatswain
is
down
after
them
now
pearce
said
the
the
weather
is
indeed
threatening
replied
the
captain
as
he
turned
from
the
weather
gangway
where
he
had
been
standing
and
wiped
the
spray
from
his
face
with
which
the
atmosphere
was
charged
and
i
perceive
that
the
glass
is
very
low
send
the
small
sails
down
out
of
the
tops
as
soon
as
the
staysail
is
on
her
lower
the
gaff
and
furl
the
spanker
the
watch
will
do
when
we
go
to
quarters
the
guns
let
the
carpenter
have
his
tarpaulins
ready
for
battening
down
send
for
the
boatswain
and
let
the
boats
on
the
booms
be
well
secured
is
that
eight
bells
striking
then
pipe
to
supper
first
and
mr
hardy
added
captain
m
as
he
descended
the
they
may
as
well
hook
the
again
ay
ay
sir
replied
hardy
as
the
captain
disappeared
i
say
master
the
skipper
do
like
it
i
swear
that
by
his
look
as
he
turned
from
the
gangway
he
was
as
stern
as
the
of
the
that
just
his
way
if
even
the
elements
threaten
him
he
returns
the
look
of
defiance
he
does
so
replied
the
master
who
appeared
to
be
unusually
grave
as
if
in
sad
presentiment
of
evil
i
watched
him
but
it
no
use
they
mind
but
one
very
true
neither
can
you
conciliate
them
by
smiling
the
only
way
to
look
is
look
sharp
eh
master
said
the
slapping
him
familiarly
on
the
back
come
no
skylarking
hardy
it
easy
to
tell
the
skipper
is
on
deck
i
expect
as
much
sleep
as
a
dog
vane
these
generally
last
their
three
days
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
merrick
a
youngster
with
an
oval
laughing
face
who
being
a
favourite
with
both
the
officers
had
ventured
to
the
of
the
in
the
absence
of
the
captain
and
why
mr
merrick
inquired
the
master
oh
it
my
morning
watch
we
shall
be
all
snug
no
sails
to
trim
no
sails
to
set
and
no
holystoning
the
deck
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
myself
warm
under
the
weather
bulwarks
ah
you
idle
scamp
said
the
smiling
so
young
man
you
wish
us
to
be
on
deck
all
night
that
you
may
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
morning
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
know
what
responsibility
is
retorted
pearce
if
you
up
all
night
sir
replied
the
boy
laughing
you
want
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
morning
watch
i
shall
come
in
for
my
share
of
that
you
know
ah
well
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
observed
pearce
but
you
are
young
to
be
selfish
indeed
i
am
not
selfish
sir
replied
the
boy
hurt
at
the
rebuke
from
one
who
had
been
kind
to
him
and
to
whom
he
was
attached
i
was
only
joking
i
only
meant
continued
he
feeling
deeply
but
not
at
the
moment
able
to
describe
his
feelings
i
only
said
oh
damn
the
coffee
and
now
you
are
only
swearing
i
suppose
replied
the
master
well
it
enough
to
make
a
saint
swear
to
be
accused
of
being
selfish
and
by
you
too
well
well
youngster
there
enough
of
it
you
spoke
without
thinking
go
down
to
your
tea
now
and
you
shall
have
your
share
of
the
coffee
if
there
is
any
after
supper
the
watch
was
called
and
the
directions
given
by
the
captain
to
the
were
punctually
obeyed
the
drum
then
beat
to
quarters
earlier
than
usual
the
guns
were
doubly
secured
the
shipped
abaft
the
number
of
inches
of
water
in
the
well
made
known
by
the
carpenter
the
sobriety
of
the
men
ascertained
by
the
officers
stationed
at
their
respective
guns
and
everything
that
was
ordered
to
be
executed
or
to
be
held
in
readiness
in
the
several
departments
reported
to
the
captain
now
mr
hardy
we
make
her
all
snug
for
the
night
furl
the
fore
and
and
the
main
that
with
the
foresail
and
trysail
will
be
enough
for
her
had
we
not
better
reef
the
foresail
sir
said
pearce
i
suspect
we
shall
have
to
do
it
before
twelve
if
we
do
not
now
very
right
mr
pearce
we
will
do
so
is
the
bent
all
bent
sir
and
the
sheet
aft
then
beat
a
retreat
and
turn
the
hands
up
shorten
sail
this
duty
was
performed
and
the
hammocks
piped
down
as
the
last
glimmering
of
daylight
disappeared
the
gale
increased
rapidly
during
the
first
watch
large
drops
of
rain
mingled
with
the
spray
distant
thunder
rolled
to
windward
and
occasional
gleams
of
lightning
pierced
through
the
intense
darkness
of
the
night
the
officers
and
men
of
the
watches
below
with
sealed
eyes
and
thoughtless
hearts
were
in
their
hammocks
trusting
to
those
on
deck
for
security
but
the
night
was
terrific
and
the
captain
and
master
from
the
responsibility
of
their
situations
continued
on
deck
as
did
many
of
the
officers
termed
idlers
such
as
the
surgeon
and
purser
who
although
their
presence
was
not
required
felt
no
inclination
to
sleep
by
four
in
the
morning
the
gale
was
at
its
height
the
lightning
darted
through
the
sky
in
every
direction
and
the
for
the
time
overpowered
the
noise
of
the
wind
as
it
roared
through
the
shrouds
the
sea
striking
on
the
was
thrown
aft
with
violence
over
the
and
waist
of
the
ship
as
she
laboured
through
the
agitated
sea
if
this
lasts
much
longer
we
must
take
the
foresail
off
of
her
and
give
her
the
said
hardy
to
the
master
we
must
indeed
replied
the
captain
who
was
standing
by
them
but
the
day
is
breaking
let
us
wait
a
little
ease
her
ease
her
it
is
sir
at
daylight
the
gale
having
rather
increased
than
shown
any
symptoms
of
abating
the
captain
was
giving
directions
for
the
foresail
to
be
taken
off
when
the
seaman
who
was
stationed
to
look
out
on
the
cried
out
a
sail
on
the
a
sail
on
the
sir
reported
the
officer
of
the
watch
to
the
captain
as
he
held
on
by
a
rope
with
one
hand
and
touched
his
hat
with
the
other
here
youngster
tell
the
sentry
at
the
cabin
door
to
give
you
my
deck
glass
said
captain
m
to
merrick
who
was
one
of
the
midshipmen
of
the
morning
watch
she
a
large
ship
sir
main
and
mizen

both
gone
reported
hardy
who
had
mounted
up
three
or
four
ratlines
of
the
the
midshipman
brought
up
the
glass
and
the
captain
first
passing
his
arm
round
the
to
secure
himself
from
falling
to
leeward
with
the
lurching
of
the
ship
as
soon
as
he
could
bring
the
strange
vessel
into
the
field
of
the
glass
exclaimed
a
ship
by
heavens
and
if
i
am
any
judge
of
a
hull
or
the
painting
of
a
ship
she
is
no
englishman
other
glasses
were
now
produced
and
the
opinion
of
the
captain
was
corroborated
by
that
of
the
officers
on
deck
keep
fast
the
foresail
mr
hardy
we
edge
down
to
her
see
the
signal
halyards
all
clear
the
captain
went
down
to
his
cabin
while
the
frigate
was
kept
away
as
he
directed
the
master
standing
at
the
conn
he
soon
came
up
again
hoist
number
at
the
fore
and
number
at
the
main
we
see
if
she
can
answer
the
private
signal
it
was
done
and
the
frigate
rolling
heavily
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
impelled
by
the
furious
elements
rapidly
closed
with
the
stranger
in
less
than
an
hour
they
were
within
half
a
mile
of
her
but
the
private
signal
remained
unanswered
now
then
bring
her
to
the
wind
mr
pearce
said
captain
m
who
had
his
glass
upon
the
vessel
the
frigate
was
luffed
handsomely
to
the
wind
not
however
without
shipping
a
heavy
sea
the
gale
which
during
the
time
that
she
was
kept
away
before
the
wind
had
the
appearance
which
it
always
has
of
having
decreased
in
force
now
that
she
presented
her
broadside
to
it
roared
again
in
all
its
fury
call
the
gunner
clear
away
the
long
gun
forward
try
with
the
rammer
whether
the
shot
has
started
from
the
cartridge
and
then
fire
across
the
bows
of
that
vessel
the
men
cast
loose
the
gun
and
the
gunner
taking
out
the
bed
and
coin
to
obtain
the
greatest
elevation
to
counteract
the
heel
of
the
frigate
watched
the
lurch
and
pitched
the
shot
close
to
the
forefoot
of
the
disabled
vessel
who
immediately
showed
french
colours
over
her
french
colours
sir
cried
two
or
three
at
a
breath
beat
to
quarters
mr
hardy
said
captain
m
shall
we
cast
loose
the
guns
no
no
that
will
be
useless
we
shall
not
be
able
to
fire
them
and
we
may
have
them
through
the
sides
we
try
her
with
the
carronades
it
was
easy
to
perceive
without
the
assistance
of
a
glass
that
the
men
on
board
the
french
ship
were
attempting
in
no
very
scientific
manner
to
get
a
up
abaft
that
by
putting
on
her
they
might
keep
their
vessel
to
the
wind
the
foresail
they
dared
not
take
off
as
without
any
sail
to
keep
her
steady
the
remaining
mast
would
in
all
probability
have
rolled
over
the
side
but
without
the
ship
would
not
keep
to
the
wind
and
the
consequence
was
that
she
was
two
points
off
the
wind
forging
fast
through
the
water
notwithstanding
that
the
helm
was
hard
where
are
we
now
mr
pearce
interrogated
the
captain
about
eight
or
nine
leagues
from
the
land
say
seven
leagues
sir
if
you
please
replied
the
master
until
i
can
give
you
an
exact
answer
and
he
descended
the
companion
ladder
to
work
up
his
reckoning
she
leaving
us
mr
hardy
keep
more
away
and
run
abreast
of
her
now
my
lads
watch
the
weather
roll
round
and
grape
do
throw
a
shot
away
aim
at
the
ports
if
we
can
prevent
her
from
getting
up
her
she
is
done
for
as
for
the
matter
of
that
said
the
who
was
captain
of
one
of
the
guns
we
might
save
our
shot
they
enough
to
get
them
up
if
left
all
to
themselves
however
a
slap
at
her
the
frigate
had
now
closed
within
three
cables
length
of
the
ship
and
considering
the
extreme
difficulty
of
hitting
any
mark
under
such
disadvantages
a
fire
was
thrown
in
by
her
disciplined
seamen
the
enemy
attempted
to
return
the
fire
from
the
weather
guns
but
it
was
a
service
of
such
difficulty
and
danger
that
he
more
than
once
abandoned
it
two
or
three
guns
disappearing
from
the
ports
proved
that
they
had
either
rolled
to
leeward
or
had
been
precipitated
down
the
hatchways
this
was
indeed
the
case
and
the
french
sailors
were
so
much
alarmed
from
the
serious
disasters
that
had
already
ensued
that
they
either
quitted
their
quarters
or
afraid
to
stand
behind
the
guns
when
they
were
fired
no
aim
was
taken
and
the
shots
were
thrown
away
had
the
two
ships
been
equally
manned
the
disadvantage
under
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
frenchman
would
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
frigate
but
the
gale
itself
was
more
than
sufficient
employment
for
the
undisciplined
crew
of
the
ship
the
fire
from
the
frigate
was
kept
up
with
vigour
although
the
vessel
lurched
so
heavily
as
often
to
throw
the
men
who
were
stationed
at
the
guns
into
the
lee
scuppers
rolling
one
over
the
other
in
the
water
with
which
the
decks
were
floated
but
this
was
only
a
subject
of
merriment
and
they
resumed
their
task
with
the
careless
spirit
of
british
seamen
the
fire
difficult
as
it
was
to
take
any
precise
aim
had
the
effect
intended
that
of
preventing
the
french
vessel
from
rigging
anything
like
a
occasionally
the
ship
kept
more
away
to
avoid
the
grape
by
increasing
her
distance
but
the
frigate
course
was
regulated
by
that
of
her
opponent
and
she
continued
her
galling
pursuit

up

master
again
came
on

and
stated
to
the

that
they
could
not

than
four
leagues
from

keeping

that
the
guns
were
primed
and
reprimed
without
the
fire
communicating
to
the
powder
which
in
a
few
seconds
was
saturated
with
the
rain
and
spray
this
was
but
of
little
consequence
as
the
squall
and
torrents
of
rain
had
now
hid
the
enemy
from
their
sight
look
out
for
her
my
men
as
soon
as
the
squall
passes
over
cried
captain
m
a
flash
of
lightning
that
blinded
them
for
a
time
was
followed
by
a
peal
of
thunder
so
close
that
the
timbers
of
the
ship
trembled
with
the
vibration
of
the
air
a
second
hostile
meeting
of
electricity
took
place
and
the
fluid
darted
down
the
side
of
the
frigate
mainmast
passing
through
the
in
the
direction
of
the
captain
m
the
master
and
fifty
or
sixty
of
the
men
were
struck
down
by
the
violence
of
the
shook
many
were
killed
more
wounded
and
the
rest
blinded
and
stunned
staggered
and
fell
to
leeward
with
the
lurching
of
the
vessel
gradually
those
who
were
only
stunned
recovered
their
legs
and
amongst
the
first
was
the
captain
of
the
frigate
as
soon
as
he
could
recall
his
scattered
senses
with
his
usual
presence
of
mind
he
desired
the
to
be
beat
by
the
drummer
and
sent
down
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
mischief
a
strong
sulphureous
smell
pervaded
the
ship
and
flew
up
the
hatchways
and
such
was
the
confusion
that
some
minutes
elapsed
before
any
report
could
be
made
it
appeared
that
the
electric
fluid
had
passed
close
to
the
and
and
escaped
through
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
before
the
report
had
been
made
the
captain
had
given
directions
for
taking
the
wounded
down
to
the
surgeon
and
the
bodies
of
the
dead
under
the
the
electric
matter
had
divided
at
the
foot
of
the
mainmast
to
which
it
had
done
no
injury
one
part
as
before
mentioned
having
gone
below
while
the
other
striking
the
iron
bolt
that
connected
the
lower
part
of
the
had
thence
passed
to
the
two
foremast
carronades
firing
them
both
off
at
the
same
moment
that
it
killed
and
wounded
the
men
who
were
stationed
at
them
the
effects
of
the
lightning
were
various
the
men
who
were
close
to
the
foot
of
the
mainmast
holding
on
by
the
ropes
belayed
to
the
were
burnt
to
a
cinder
and
their
blackened
corpses
lay
smoking
in
the
remnants
of
their
clothes
emitting
an
overpowering
ammoniacal
stench
some
were
only
wounded
in
the
arm
or
leg
but
the
scathed
member
was
shrivelled
up
and
they
were
borne
down
the
hatchway
howling
with
intolerable
pain
the
most
awful
effects
were
at
the
guns
the
captains
of
the
two
carronades
and
several
men
that
were
near
them
were
dead
but
had
not
the
equipoise
of
the
bodies
been
lost
by
the
violent
motion
of
the
ship
their
dreadful
fate
would
not
have
been
immediately
perceived
not
an
injury
appeared
every
muscle
was
fixed
to
the
same
position
as
when
the
fluid
entered
the
same
expression
of
countenance
the
eye
like
life
as
it
watched
the
sight
on
the
gun
the
body
bent
forward
the
arm
extended
the
fingers
still
holding
the
lanyard
attached
to
the
lock
nothing
but
palpable
evidence
could
convince
one
that
they
were
dead
the
boy
attending
with
his
upon
which
he
had
sat
by
the
directions
of
the
captain
of
the
gun
was
desired
by
captain
m
to
jump
up
and
assist
the
men
in
carrying
down
the
wounded
he
sat
still
on
his
box
supported
between
the
capstan
and
the
stanchions
of
the
companion
hatchway
his
eyes
apparently
fixed
upon
the
captain
but
not
moving
in
obedience
to
the
order
although
repeated
in
an
angry
tone
he
was
dead
during
the
confusion
attending
this
catastrophe
the
guns
had
been
deserted
as
soon
as
the
wounded
men
had
been
taken
below
the
captain
desired
the
boatswain
to
pipe
to
quarters
for
the
drummer
when
called
to
beat
the
had
been
summoned
to
his
last
account
the
guns
were
again
manned
and
the
firing
recommenced
but
a
want
of
energy
and
the
melancholy
silence
which
prevailed
evidently
showed
that
the
men
although
they
obeyed
did
not
obey
cheerfully
another
pull
of
the
mr
hardsett
cried
captain
m
through
his
ay
ay
sir
clap
on
him
my
lads
replied
the
boatswain
holding
his
call
between
his
teeth
as
he
lent
the
assistance
of
his
powerful
frame
to
the
exertions
of
the
men
the
sheet
was
aft
and
belayed
and
the
boatswain
indulged
in
muttered
quotations
from
the
scriptures
he
bringeth
forth
the
clouds
from
the
ends
of
the
world
and
sendeth
forth
lightnings
with
rain
bringing
the
winds
out
of
his
treasuries
he
smote
the
of
egypt
the
and
master
were
in
close
consultation
to
windward
the
captain
stood
at
the
occasionally
desiring
the
at
the
conn
to
alter
the
course
regulating
his
own
by
that
of
his
disabled
enemy
i
speak
to
him
then
exclaimed
pearce
as
the
conference
broke
up
and
he
went
over
to
leeward
to
the
captain
captain
m
i
have
had
the
honour
to
serve
under
your
command
some
time
and
i
trust
you
will
allow
that
i
have
never
shown
any
want
of
zeal
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
no
mr
pearce
replied
the
captain
with
a
grave
smile
without
compliment
you
never
have
then
sir
you
will
not
be
affronted
at
or
ascribe
to
unworthy
motives
a
remark
which
i
wish
to
make
most
certainly
not
as
i
am
persuaded
that
you
will
never
make
any
observation
inconsistent
with
your
duty
or
infringing
upon
the
rules
of
the
service
then
sir
with
all
due
submission
to
you
i
do
think
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
other
officers
as
well
that
our
present
employment
under
existing
circumstances
is
tempting
if
not
insulting
the
almighty
look
at
the
sky
look
at
the
raging
sea
hear
the
wind
and
call
to
mind
the
effects
of
the
lightning
not
one
since
when
the
almighty
appears
in
all
his
wrath
in
all
his
tremendous
majesty
is
it
a
time
for
us
poor
mortals
to
be
at
strife
what
is
our
feeble
artillery
what
is
the
roar
of
our
cannon
compared
to
the
withering
and
consuming
artillery
of
heaven
has
he
not
told
us
so
and
do
not
the
ship
company
by
their
dispirited
conduct
since
the
vessel
was
struck
acknowledge
it
the
officers
all
feel
it
sir
is
it
not
presumptuous
with
all
due
submission
sir
is
it
not
wicked
i
respect
your
feelings
as
a
christian
and
as
a
man
replied
captain
m
but
i
must
differ
with
you
that
the
almighty
power
appears
i
grant
and
i
feel
as
you
do
that
god
is
great
and
man
weak
and
impotent
but
that
this
storm
has
been
raised
that
this
thunder
rolls
that
this
lightning
has
blasted
us
as
a
i
deny
the
causes
emanate
from
the
almighty
but
he
leaves
the
effects
to
the
arrangements
of
nature
which
is
governed
by
immutable
laws
had
there
been
no
other
vessel
in
sight
this
lightning
would
still
have
struck
us
and
this
storm
will
not
cease
even
if
we
were
to
neglect
what
i
consider
a
duty
to
our
country
the
master
touched
his
hat
and
made
no
answer
it
was
now
about
one
and
the
horizon
to
leeward
clearing
up
a
little
showed
the
land
upon
the
land
ho
cried
one
of
the
men
indeed
observed
the
captain
to
the
master
we
are
nearer
than
you
thought
something
sir
perhaps
but
recollect
how
many
hours
you
have
kept
away
after
this
vessel
very
true
rejoined
the
captain
and
the
into
the
bargain
i
am
not
surprised
at
it
shall
we
haul
our
wind
sir
we
are
on
a
dead
no
mr
pearce
not
until
the
fate
of
that
vessel
is
decided
land
on
the
reported
the
boatswain
indeed
said
the
captain
then
the
affair
will
soon
be
decided
the
vessels
still
continued
their
course
in
a
slanting
direction
towards
the
land
pursuer
and
pursued
running
on
to
destruction
but
although
various
indirect
hints
were
given
by
the
and
others
captain
m
turned
a
deaf
ear
he
surveyed
the
dangers
which
presented
themselves
and
frowned
upon
them
as
if
in
defiance
chapter
fifty
three
an
universal
cry
resounds
aloud
the
sailors
run
in
heaps
a
helpless
crowd
art
fails
and
courage
falls
no
succour
near
as
many
waves
as
many
deaths
appear
ovid
dryden
translation
however
we
may
be
inclined
to
extend
our
admiration
to
the
feelings
of
which
governed
the
conduct
of
captain
m
it
can
not
be
a
matter
of
surprise
that
the
officers
of
the
frigate
did
not
coincide
with
his
total
indifference
to
self
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
murmur
they
did
not
but
they
looked
at
each
other
at
the
captain
and
at
the
perilous
situation
of
the
vessel
in
silence
and
with
a
restless
change
of
position
that
indicated
their
anxiety
macallan
was
below
attending
to
the
wounded
men
or
he
would
probably
have
been
deputed
by
the
others
to
have
remonstrated
with
the
captain
a
few
minutes
more
had
elapsed
when
the
master
again
addressed
him
i
am
afraid
sir
if
we
continue
to
stand
on
that
we
shall
lose
the
frigate
said
he
respectfully
touching
his
hat
be
it
so
replied
captain
m
the
enemy
will
lose
a
ship
our
country
will
be
the
gainer
when
the
account
is
balanced
i
must
be
permitted
to
doubt
that
sir
the
value
of
the
enemy
ship
is
certainly
greater
but
there
are
other
considerations
what
are
they
the
value
of
the
respective
officers
and
ships
companies
which
must
inevitably
share
the
fate
of
the
two
vessels
the
captain
of
that
ship
is
not
his
it
would
be
politic
to
let
him
live
and
continue
to
command
his
ship
will
always
be
ours
when
we
want
it
and
in
the
event
of
a
general
action
he
would
make
a
gap
in
the
line
which
might
prove
of
the
greatest
importance
now
sir
without
drawing
the
parallel
any
further
without
taking
into
consideration
the
value
of
the
respective
officers
and
men
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
observing
that
on
your
account
alone
england
will
be
no
gainer
by
the
loss
of
both
vessels
and
crews
thank
you
for
the
compliment
which
as
it
is
only
i
will
allow
to
be
thrown
into
the
scale
but
i
do
not
agree
with
you
i
consider
war
but
as
a
game
of
chess
and
will
never
hesitate
to
sacrifice
a
for
a
provided
that
is
lost
mr
pearce
continued
the
captain
pointing
to
the
french
vessel
this
little
frigate
if
necessary
shall
be
enough
to
bear
her
company
very
good
sir
replied
pearce
again
touching
his
hat
as
master
of
this
ship
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
state
my
opinion
you
have
done
your
duty
mr
pearce
and
i
thank
you
for
it
but
i
have
also
my
duties
to
perform
one
of
them
is
not
to
allow
the
lives
of
one
ship
company
however
brave
and
and
such
i
must
allow
to
be
the
one
i
have
the
honour
to
command
to
interfere
with
the
general
interests
of
the
country
we
contend
for
when
a
man
enters
his
majesty
service
his
life
is
no
longer
to
be
considered
his
own
it
belongs
to
his
king
and
country
and
is
at
their
disposal
if
we
are
lost
there
will
be
no
great
difficulty
in
collecting
another
company
in
old
england
as
brave
and
as
good
as
this
officers
as
experienced
are
anxiously
waiting
for
employment
and
the
admiralty
will
have
no
trouble
in
selecting
and
appointing
as
good
if
not
a
better
captain
the
contending
ships
were
now
about
two
cables
length
from
each
other
with
a
high
rocky
coast
lashed
with
a
tremendous
surf
about
of
a
mile
to
leeward
the
promontory
extended
about
two
points
on
the
weatherbow
of
the
frigate
and
a
low
sandy
tongue
of
land
spread
itself
far
out
on
her
weather
quarter
so
that
both
vessels
were
completely
embayed
the
ship
again
made
an
attempt
to
get
up
some
but
the
fire
of
the
frigate
whenever
she
rose
on
the
tops
of
the
mountainous
waves
which
at
intervals
hid
the
hulls
of
both
vessels
from
each
other
drove
the
frenchmen
from
their
task
of
safety
and
it
was
now
evident
that
all
command
of
her
was
lost
she
rolled
gunwale
under
and
her
remaining
mast
went
by
the
board
nothing
can
save
her
now
sir
replied
the
master
no
replied
the
captain
we
have
done
our
work
and
must
now
try
to
save
ourselves
secure
the
guns
be
smart
my
lads
you
work
for
your
lives
we
must
put
the
mainsail
on
her
mr
pearce
and
draw
off
if
we
can
the
master
shook
his
head
hands
by
the
and
buntlines
man
the
mainsheet
let
go
those
youngster
haul
aboard
it
a
pity
too
by
god
said
the
captain
looking
over
the
at
the
french
vessel
which
was
now
running
before
the
wind
right
on
to
the
eight
or
nine
hundred
poor
devils
will
be
called
to
their
last
account
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
i
wish
we
could
save
them
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
sir
said
the
master
with
a
grave
smile
at
this
reaction
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
captain
nothing
can
save
them
and
i
am
afraid
that
nothing
but
a
slant
of
wind
or
a
miracle
can
help
ourselves
she
has
struck
sir
and
is
over
on
her
broadside
said
the
who
was
standing
on
the
carronade
slide
mind
your
conn
sir
keep
your
eyes
on
the
of
the
sail
and
not
upon
that
ship
answered
the
captain
with
asperity
in
the
meantime
the
mainsail
had
been
set
by
the
and
the
crew
unoccupied
had
their
eyes
directed
for
a
little
while
upon
the
french
vessel
which
lay
on
her
enveloped
in
spray
but
they
also
perceived
what
during
the
occupation
and
anxiety
of
action
they
had
not
had
leisure
to
attend
to
namely
the
desperate
situation
of
their
own
ship
the
promontory
was
now
broad
on
the
weather
bow
and
a
reef
of
rocks
partly
above
water
extended
from
it
to
leeward
of
the
frigate
such
was
the
anxiety
of
the
ship
company
for
their
own
safety
that
the
eyes
of
the
men
were
turned
away
from
the
stranded
vessel
and
fixed
upon
the
rocks
the
frigate
did
all
that
a
gallant
vessel
could
do
rising
from
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
shaking
the
water
from
her
as
she
was
occasionally
buried
forecastle
under
from
the
great
pressure
of
the
sail
cleaving
the
huge
masses
of
the
element
with
her
sharp
stem
and
trembling
fore
and
aft
with
the
violence
of
her
own
exertions
but
the
mountainous
waves
took
her
with
irresistible
force
from
her
chesstree
retarding
her
velocity
and
forcing
her
each
moment
nearer
to
the
reef
wear
ship
mr
hardy
said
the
captain
who
had
not
spoken
one
word
since
he
rebuked
the
we
have
but
just
room
the
master
directed
the
man
at
the
wheel
to
put
helm
up
in
a
firm
but
subdued
tone
for
he
was
at
that
moment
thinking
of
his
wife
and
children
the
ship
had
just
paid
off
and
gathered
fresh
way
when
she
struck
upon
a
sunken
rock
a
loud
and
piercing
cry
from
the
company
was
followed
by
an
enormous
sea
striking
the
frigate
on
the
counter
at
once
heeling
her
over
and
forcing
her
ahead
so
that
she
slipped
off
from
the
rock
again
into
deep
water
she
off
again
sir
said
the
master
it
god
mercy
mr
pearce
bring
her
to
the
wind
as
soon
as
you
can
replied
the
captain
with
composure
but
the
carpenter
now
ran
up
the
hatchway
and
with
a
pallid
face
and
hurried
tone
declared
that
the
ship
was
filling
fast
and
could
not
be
kept
afloat
more
than
a
few
minutes
going
down
going
down
was
spread
with
dreadful
rapidity
throughout
the
ship
and
all
discipline
and
subordination
appeared
to
be
at
an
end
some
of
the
men
flew
to
the
boats
hoisted
up
on
the
quarters
and
were
casting
loose
the
ropes
which
secured
them
with
hands
that
were
tremulous
with
anxiety
and
fear
silence
there
fore
and
aft
roared
the
captain
in
the
full
compass
of
his
powerful
voice
every
man
to
his
station
come
out
of
those
boats
directly
all
obeyed
except
one
man
who
still
continued
to
cast
loose
the
gripes
come
out
sir
repeated
the
captain
not
i
by
god
replied
the
sailor
coolly
the
which
had
been
lashed
round
the
had
been
detached
either
from
the
shot
of
the
enemy
or
some
other
means
and
were
lying
on
the
deck
close
to
the
cabin
skylight
the
captain
seizing
one
and
poising
it
brandished
over
his
head
a
third
time
ordered
the
sailor
to
leave
the
boat
every
man
for
himself
and
god
for
us
all
was
the
cool
answer
of
the
refractory
seaman
the
pike
flew
and
entered
the
man
bowels
up
to
the
hilt
the
poor
wretch
staggered
made
a
snatch
at
the
davit
missed
it
and
fell
backwards
over
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
into
the
sea
my
lads
said
captain
m
emphatically
addressing
the
men
who
beheld
the
scene
with
dismay
as
long
as
one
plank
ay
one
of
this
vessel
swims
i
command
and
will
be
obeyed
put
the
helm
up
i
have
but
few
words
to
say
to
you
my
men
the
vessel
is
sinking
and
we
must
put
her
on
the
reef
boats
are
useless
if
she
hangs
together
do
you
hang
to
her
as
your
only
chance
and
now
farewell
my
brave
fellows
for
we
are
not
all
likely
to
meet
again
look
out
for
a
soft
place
for
her
mr
pearce
if
you
can
i
see
but
one
spot
where
there
is
the
least
chance
of
her
being
thrown
up
sir
starboard
a
little
steady
so
were
the
cool
directions
of
the
master
as
the
ship
flew
with
increased
velocity
to
her
doom
the
captain
stood
on
the
carronade
slide
from
which
he
had
addressed
the
men
his
mien
was
firm
and
erect
not
a
muscle
of
his
countenance
was
observed
to
change
or
move
as
the
sailors
watched
it
as
the
barometer
of
their
fate
awed
by
the
dreadful
punishment
of
the
mutineer
and
restrained
by
their
long
habits
of
discipline
they
awaited
their
doom
in
a
state
of
intense
anxiety
but
in
silence
all
this
latter
description
however
was
but
the
event
of
about
two
minutes
which
had
barely
expired
when
the
frigate
dashed
upon
the
reef
chapter
fifty
four
thou
god
of
this
great
vast
rebuke
those
surges
which
wash
both
heaven
and
hell
and
thou
that
hast
upon
the
winds
command
bind
then
in
brass
having
called
them
from
the
deep
shakespeare
the
shock
threw
the
men
off
their
feet
as
they
raised
an
appealing
cry
to
heaven
which
was
mocked
by
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
roar
of
the
waters
the
masts
which
were
thrown
out
from
their
steps
waved
once
twice
and
then
fell
over
the
sides
with
a
crash
as
an
enormous
sea
broke
over
the
vessel
forcing
her
further
on
the
rocks
and
causing
every
timber
and
knee
in
her
to
start
from
its
place
the
masts
as
they
fell
and
the
sea
that
at
the
same
moment
poured
over
like
an
impetuous
cataract
swept
away
thirty
or
forty
of
the
seamen
into
the
boiling
element
under
the
lee
another
and
another
shock
from
the
resistless
and
furious
waves
decided
the
fate
of
the
resolute
captain
and
master
the
frigate
parted
amidships
the
fore
part
of
her
which
was
firmly
wedged
on
the
rocks
remained
the
and
turned
over
to
the
deep
water
and
disappeared
an
enormous
surge
curled
over
it
as
it
went
down
and
as
if
disappointed
at
not
being
able
to
wreak
its
fury
upon
that
part
of
the
vessel
which
by
sinking
had
evaded
it
it
drove
in
revenge
upon
the
remainder
forcing
it
several
yards
higher
upon
the
reef
of
the
ship
company
were
now
gone
the
captain
the
master
and
the
major
part
of
the
officers
and
men
being
on
the
when
the
ship
divided
the
cry
of
the
drowning
was
not
heard
amidst
the
roaring
of
the
elements
the
behaviour
of
the
captain
and
the
officers
at
this
dreadful
crisis
has
not
been
handed
down
but
if
we
may
judge
from
what
has
already
been
narrated
they
met
their
fate
like
british
seamen
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
still
held
together
and
fortunately
for
the
survivors
heeled
towards
the
land
so
as
to
afford
some
protection
from
the
force
of
the
seas
which
dashed
over
it
at
each
succeeding
swell
of
the
billows
daylight
left
them
and
darkness
added
to
the
despair
and
horror
of
nearly
one
hundred
wretches
who
felt
at
each
shock
which
threatened
to
separate
the
planks
and
timbers
as
if
death
was
loudly
knocking
to
claim
the
residue
of
his
destined
victims
not
one
word
was
exchanged
but
secured
with
ropes
to
the
and
other
parts
of
the
forecastle
where
they
could
pass
their
lashings
they
clung
and
huddled
together
either
absorbed
in
meditation
or
wailing
with
despair
occasionally
one
who
had
supported
himself
in
a
difficult
and
painful
position
stimulated
with
the
faint
hopes
of
life
to
which
we
all
so
fondly
and
so
foolishly
cling
would
find
that
his
strength
was
exhausted
and
that
he
could
hold
no
longer
after
vainly
imploring
those
near
him
to
allow
him
to
better
his
condition
by
a
slight
personal
sacrifice
on
their
part
an
appeal
that
received
no
answer
he
would
gradually
loose
his
hold
and
drop
into
the
surge
that
was
commissioned
by
death
to
receive
his
prey
there
are
situations
in
human
life
of
such
powerful
excitement
and
in
which
the
mechanism
of
the
human
frame
becomes
so
rapid
in
its
motion
that
the
friction
of
a
few
days
will
wear
it
out
the
harrowed
feelings
of
these
poor
creatures
on
the
wreck
during
the
short
time
that
they
remained
had
a
greater
effect
in
undermining
the
constitution
than
many
years
of
laborious
occupation
on
shore
if
you
are
at
all
interested
with
the
scenes
i
am
now
describing
and
which
if
you
have
any
feeling
you
must
be
however
imperfect
the
description
let
the
author
a
sailor
himself
take
this
favourable
opportunity
of
appealing
to
you
in
behalf
of
a
service
at
once
your
protection
and
your
pride
for
its
sake
as
well
as
your
own
listen
not
to
those
who
expatiating
upon
its
expense
and
silent
upon
its
deserts
would
put
a
stop
to
hardly
earned
promotion
and
blast
with
disappointment
the
energies
of
the
incipient
hero
and
may
those
to
whom
the
people
at
large
have
delegated
their
trust
and
in
whom
they
have
reposed
their
confidence
treat
with
contempt
the
calculations
and
miscalculations
of
one
without
head
and
without
heart
daylight
again
as
if
unwillingly
appeared
and
the
wild
scud
flew
past
the
dark
clouds
that
seemed
to
sink
down
with
their
heavy
burdens
till
they
nearly
touched
the
sea
the
waves
still
followed
each
other
mountains
high
the
wind
blew
with
the
same
violence
and
as
the
stormy
petrels
flew
over
the
billows
indicating
by
their
presence
that
the
gale
would
continue
the
unfortunate
survivors
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
and
despair
i
know
not
whether
all
seamen
feel
as
i
do
but
i
have
witnessed
so
many
miraculous
escapes
so
many
sudden
reverses
so
much
beyond
all
hope
and
conception
achieved
by
a
reliance
upon
providence
and
your
own
exertions
that
under
the
most
critical
circumstances
i
never
should
despair
if
struggling
in
the
centre
of
the
atlantic
with
no
vessel
in
sight
no
strength
remaining
and
sinking
under
the
wave
that
boiled
in
my
ear
as
memory
and
life
were
departing
still
as
long
as
life
remain
as
long
as
recollection
held
her
seat
i
never
should
abandon
hope
never
believe
that
it
is
all
over
with
me
till
i
awoke
in
the
next
world
and
found
it
confirmed
what
would
these
men
have
valued
their
lives
at
in
the
morning
yet
at
noon
a
change
took
place
the
weather
evidently
moderated
fast
and
silence
that
had
reigned
for
so
many
hours
lost
his
empire
and
the
chances
of
being
saved
began
to
be
calculated
a
reef
of
rocks
many
of
them
above
water
over
which
the
breakers
still
raged
lay
between
the
wreck
and
the
shore
and
the
certainty
of
being
dashed
to
pieces
precluded
all
attempts
at
reaching
it
till
the
weather
became
more
moderate
and
the
sea
less
agitated
but
when
might
that
be
and
how
long
were
they
to
resist
the
united
attacks
of
hunger
and
fatigue
the
number
of
men
still
surviving
was
about
seventy
many
exhausted
and
wounded
were
hanging
in
a
state
of
insensibility
by
the
ropes
with
which
they
had
secured
themselves
that
our
hero
was
among
those
who
remained
need
hardly
be
observed
or
there
would
have
been
a
close
to
this
eventful
history
he
was
secured
to
the
weather
side
of
the
supported
on
the
one
side
by
the
boatswain
and
on
the
other
by
price
the
next
to
whom
was
the
captain
of
the
forecastle
one
of
the
steadiest
and
best
seamen
in
the
ship
who
had
been
pressed
out
of
a
west
indiaman
in
which
he
had
served
in
the
capacity
of
second
mate
our
hero
had
often
turned
round
with
an
intention
to
speak
to
price
but
observing
that
he
sat
crouched
with
his
face
upon
his
hands
and
knees
he
waited
until
his
messmate
should
raise
his
head
up
imagining
that
he
was
occupied
in
secret
prayer
finding
that
he
still
continued
in
the
same
position
seymour
called
to
him
several
times
not
receiving
any
answer
he
extended
his
arm
and
shook
price
by
the
collar
fearing
that
he
had
swooned
from
cold
and
fatigue
price
slowly
raised
his
head
and
looking
at
seymour
answered
not
his
vacant
stare
and
wild
eye
proclaimed
at
once
that
reason
had
departed
still
as
it
afterwards
appeared
his
ruling
passion
remained
and
from
that
incomprehensible
quality
of
our
structure
which
proves
that
the
mind
of
man
is
more
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
than
the
body
the
desertion
of
one
sense
was
followed
by
the
return
of
another
his
was
perfect
now
that
his
was
gone
surveying
the
scene
around
him
he
began
with
all
the
theatrical
action
which
the
ropes
that
secured
him
would
permit
to
quote
his
favourite
author
winds
and
crack
your
cheeks
rage
blow
you
cataracts
and
hurricanoes
spout
tom
then
shuddering
he
covered
up
his
face
and
resumed
his
former
position
is
this
a
time
for
spouting
profane
plays
mr
price
said
the
fanatical
boatswain
who
was
not
aware
of
the
poor
man
insanity
hold
your
peace
and
call
not
judgment
on
our
heads
and
i
prophesy
that
we
shall
be
saved
waves
of
the
sea
are
mighty
and
rage
horribly
but
yet
the
lord
who
dwelleth
on
high
is
mightier
silence
ensued
which
after
a
few
minutes
was
interrupted
by
seymour
lamenting
over
the
fate
of
captain
m
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
who
had
perished
well
they
are
in
heaven
before
this
i
hope
observed
robinson
the
captain
of
the
forecastle
are
called
but
few
chosen
rejoined
the
boatswain
who
appeared
by
the
flashing
of
his
eye
to
be
in
a
state
of
strong
excitement
no
more
in
heaven
than
you
would
be
if
the
almighty
was
pleased
to
cut
you
off
in
his
wrath
where
then
mr
hardsett
inquired
robinson
surely
not
in
i
know
i
know
cried
price
who
again
lifted
up
his
head
and
with
a
vacant
laugh
commenced
singing
nothing
of
him
that
doth
fade
but
doth
suffer
a
into
something
rich
and
strange
sea
nymphs
hourly
ring
his
knell
hark
now
i
hear
them
for
shame
mr
price
interrupted
the
boatswain
mr
price
what
does
the
scripture
say
are
prepared
for
scorners
continued
the
boatswain
with
vehemence
price
had
resumed
his
former
attitude
and
made
no
answer
as
soon
as
the
interruption
of
the
lieutenant
had
ceased
robinson
resumed
his
interrogatory
to
the
boatswain
where
then
not
in
hell
i
hope
ay
returned
the
latter
in
the
fire
that
is
never
quenched
and
for
ever
and
ever
i
hope
not
replied
robinson
i
may
deserve
punishment
and
i
know
i
do
i
been
overhauling
my
while
the
sea
here
has
been
dashing
over
my
bows
and
washing
my
and
there
are
some
things
i
wish
i
could
forget
they
will
rise
up
in
judgment
against
me
but
surely
not
for
ever
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
my
good
fellow
i
am
sorry
for
you
sorry
for
all
those
who
have
perished
for
they
were
good
seamen
and
in
the
worldly
service
have
done
well
i
was
reflecting
the
other
day
whether
out
of
the
whole
navy
i
should
be
able
to
muster
one
single
ship
company
in
heaven
well
mr
hardsett
it
my
firm
opinion
that
when
the
hands
are
turned
up
for
punishment
in
the
next
world
we
shall
be
sarved
out
according
to
our
desarts
now
that
my
belief
and
i
sha
change
it
for
yours
mr
hardsett
for
i
thinks
mine
the
more
comfortable
of
the
two
it
wo
do
robinson
you
must
have
faith
so
i
have
in
god
mercy
boatswain
that
wo
do
yours
is
not
the
true
faith
mayhap
not
but
i
hope
to
ride
it
out
with
it
nevertheless
for
i
have
it
well
backed
with
hope
and
if
i
still
drive
said
robinson
musing
a
short
time
why
i
have
charity
as
a
to
bring
me
up
again
it
long
odds
but
our
bodies
will
soon
be
knocked
to
shivers
in
those
breakers
and
we
shall
then
know
who
right
and
who
wrong
i
see
small
chance
of
our
saving
ourselves
unless
indeed
we
could
walk
on
the
sea
and
there
was
but
one
that
ever
did
that
had
the
apostle
had
faith
he
would
not
have
sunk
rejoined
the
boatswain
have
you
then
more
faith
than
the
apostle
i
have
thanks
be
to
jehovah
the
true
faith
cried
the
boatswain
raising
his
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
then
on
said
the
captain
of
the
forecastle
looking
him
steadfastly
in
the
face
stimulated
by
the
request
which
appeared
to
put
his
courage
as
a
man
and
his
faith
as
a
christian
to
the
test
and
at
the
moment
fanatic
even
to
insanity
the
boatswain
rose
and
casting
off
the
ropes
which
he
had
wound
round
his
body
was
about
to
comply
with
robinson
request
a
few
moments
more
and
the
raging
sea
would
have
received
him
had
not
our
hero
in
conjunction
with
the
captain
of
the
forecastle
held
him
down
with
all
his
power
we
doubt
not
your
faith
mr
hardsett
said
seymour
but
the
time
of
miracles
is
past
it
would
be
he
who
raised
the
storm
will
in
his
own
good
time
save
us
if
he
thinks
fit
price
who
had
listened
to
the
conversation
and
had
watched
the
motions
of
the
boatswain
who
was
casting
off
the
lashings
which
had
secured
him
had
unperceived
done
the
same
and
now
jumped
upon
his
legs
and
collared
the
astonished
boatswain
roaring
out
zounds
show
me
what
do
weep
fight
fast
tear
thyself
why
he
mad
exclaimed
the
terrified
boatswain
who
was
not
far
off
the
point
himself
mad
resumed
price
not
a
soul
but
felt
a
fever
of
the
mad
and
some
tricks
of
desperation
the
king
son
ferdinand
with
hair
upstarting
then
like
reeds
not
hair
was
the
first
man
that
leaped
cried
hell
is
empty
and
all
the
devils
are
here
as
the
maniac
finished
the
last
words
before
they
could
be
aware
of
his
intention
he
made
a
spring
from
the
deck
over
the
bulwark
and
disappeared
under
the
wave
the
boatswain
who
had
been
diverted
from
his
fanatical
attempt
by
the
unexpected
attack
of
price
more
than
by
the
remonstrances
of
his
companions
resumed
his
position
folding
his
arms
and
casting
his
eyes
to

the
captain
of
the
forecastle
was
silent
and
so
was
our
hero
the
thoughts
of
the
two
were
upon
the
same
subject
eternity
eternity
the
only
theme
that
confuses
humbles
and
alarms
the
proud
intellect
of
man
what
is
it
the
human
mind
can
grasp
any
defined
space
any
defined
time
however
vast
but
this
is
beyond
time
and
too
great
for
the
limited
conception
of
man
it
had
no
beginning
and
can
have
no
end
it
can
not
be
multiplied
it
can
not
be
divided
it
can
not
be
added
unto
you
may
attempt
to
subtract
from
it
but
it
is
useless
take
millions
and
millions
of
years
from
it
take
all
the
time
that
can
enter
into
the
compass
of
your
imagination
it
is
still
whole
and
undiminished
as
before
all
calculation
is
lost
think
on
the
brain
becomes
heated
and
oppressed
with
a
sensation
of
weight
too
powerful
for
it
to
bear
reason
totters
in
her
seat
and
you
rise
with
the
conviction
of
the
impossibility
of
the
creature
attempting
to
fathom
the
creator
humiliated
with
the
sense
of
your
own
nothingness
and
impressed
with

tremendous
majesty
of

thou

that

touched
upon

ay
my
lord
and

in
ill
time
winter
tale
about
midnight
the
moon
burst
through
the
clouds
which
gradually
rolled
away
to
the
western
horizon
as
if
they
had
been
furled
by
some
invisible
spirits
in
the
air
the
wind
after
several
feeble
gusts
like
the
last
breathings
of
some
expiring
creature
unwilling
to
loosen
the
silver
cord
subsided
to
a
calm
it
then
shifted
round
to
the
eastward
the
waves
relaxed
in
their
force
until
they
did
little
more
than
play
upon
the
side
of
the
wreck
so
lately
the
object
of
their
fury
the
dark
shadows
of
the
rocks
were
no
longer
relieved
by
the
white
foam
of
the
surf
which
had
raged
among
them
with
such
violence
before
morning
all
was
calm
and
the
survivors
as
they
shrunk
and
shivered
in
their
wet
garments
encouraged
each
other
with
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
termination
to
their
sufferings
on
the
reappearance
of
daylight
the
sun
rose
in
splendour
and
seemed
as
he
darted
his
searching
rays
through
the
cloudless
expanse
to
exclaim
in
his
pride
behold
how
i
bring
light
and
heat
joy
and
salvation
to
you
late
despairing
creatures
the
rocks
of
the
reef
above
water
which
had
previously
been
a
source
of
horror
and
had
been
contemplated
as
the
sure
engines
of
their
destruction
were
now
joyfully
reckoned
as
so
many
for
those
who
were
about
to
attempt
to
reach
the
land
the
most
daring
and
expert
swimmers
launched
themselves
into
the
water
and
made
for
the
nearest
cluster
of
rocks
with
difficulty
gaining
a
footing
on
them
after
clinging
by
the
dark
and
slippery
which
covered
their
tops
like
shaggy
hair
on
the
heads
of
so
many
emerging
giants
the
waving
of
the
hands
of
the
party
who
had
succeeded
in
gaining
the
rocks
encouraged
a
second
to
follow
while
others
who
could
not
swim
were
busily
employed
in
searching
for
the
means
of
supporting
themselves
in
the
water
and
floating
themselves
on
shore
self
that
had
predominated
now
lost
its
ground
those
who
had
allowed
their
shipmates
to
perish
in
attempting
to
gain
the
same
place
of
security
as
themselves
without
an
effort
in
their
favour
or
one
sigh
for
their
unlucky
fate
now
that
hope
was
revived
almost
to
a
certainty
of
deliverance
showed
as
much
interest
in
the
preservation
of
others
lying
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
as
they
did
for
their
own
the
remaining
officers
recovered
their
authority
which
had
been
disregarded
and
the
shattered
fragment
of
the
reassumed
their
rights
of
discipline
and
obedience
to
the
last
in
a
few
hours
sick
disabled
and
wounded
were
all
safely
landed
and
the
raft
which
had
been
constructed
returned
to
the
wreck
to
bring
on
shore
whatever
might
be
useful
our
hero
who
was
the
only
officer
who
had
been
saved
with
the
exception
of
the
boatswain
had
taken
upon
himself
the
command
and
occupied
himself
with
the
arrangements
necessary
for
the
shelter
and
sustenance
of
his
men
a
range
of
barren
hills
abruptly
rising
from
the
coast
covered
with
large
fragments
and
detached
pieces
of
rock
without
any
symptom
of
cultivation
or
any
domesticated
animal
in
sight
which
might
imply
that
human
aid
was
not
far
distant
met
the
eye
of
seymour
as
he
directed
it
to
every
point
in
hopes
of
succour
for
his
wounded
and
exhausted
companions
one
of
the
men
whom
he
had
sent
to
reconnoitre
returned
in
a
few
minutes
stating
that
behind
a
jutting
rock
which
he
pointed
to
with
his
finger
not
two
hundred
yards
distant
he
had
discovered
a
hut
or
what
in
ireland
is
termed
a
shealing
and
that
there
appeared
to
be
a
bridle
road
from
it
leading
over
the
mountain
to
this
shelter
our
hero
determined
to
remove
his
disabled
men
and
in
company
with
the
boatswain
and
the
man
who
had
returned
with
the
intelligence
set
off
to
examine
the
spot
passing
the
rock
he
perceived
that
the
hut
which
bore
every
sign
from
its
smokeless
chimney
and
air
of
negligence
and
decay
to
have
been
some
time
deserted
stood
upon
a
piece
of
ground
about
an
acre
in
extent
which
had
once
been
cultivated
but
was
now
luxuriant
with
a
spontaneous
crop
of
weeds
and
thistles
he
approached
the
entrance
and
as
the
rude
door
creaked
upon
its
hinges
when
he
threw
it
open
was
saluted
by
a
faint
voice
which
cried
va
why
there
irishmen
inside
observed
the
sailor
frenchmen
rather
i
should
imagine
replied
our
hero
as
he
entered
and
discovered
seven
or
eight
of
the
unfortunate
survivors
of
the
french
ship
who
had
crawled
there
bruised
cut
and
apparently
in
the
last
state
of
exhaustion
said
one
of
them
with
difficulty
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
i
am
afraid
not
replied
seymour
looking
with
compassion
on
the
group
all
of
which
had
their
eyes
directed
towards
him
although
from
their
wounds
and
bruises
they
were
not
able
to
turn
their
bodies
we
are
shipwrecked
as
well
as
you
what
did
you
belong
to
that
cursed
frigate
we
did
replied
seymour
and
there
are
but
few
of
us
alive
to
tell
the
tale
la
cried
the
frenchman
pas
echappee
je
plus
des
repeated
the
rest
of
the
french
party
in
faint
accents
moi
je
meurs
murmured
one
who
in
a
few
seconds
afterwards
expired
are
you
the
only
survivors
demanded
seymour
all
that
are
left
replied
the
spokesman
of
the
party
out
of
eight
hundred
and
fifty
men
i
hardly
know
what
we
have
something
has
been
saved
from
the
wreck
replied
seymour
and
shall
cheerfully
be
shared
with
you
with
all
the
assistance
we
can
afford
we
were
enemies
but
we
are
now
brothers
in
affliction
i
must
quit
you
to
bring
up
our
wounded
men
there
is
sufficient
room
i
perceive
for
all
of
us
pour
le
que
un
brave
garcon
ce
observed
the
frenchman
to
his
companions
as
seymour
and
his
party
quitted
the
hut
seymour
returned
to
the
beach
and
collecting
his
men
found
the
survivors
to
consist
of
seamen
and
marines
the
boatswain
and
himself
of
these
fifteen
were
helpless
from
wounds
and
fractured
limbs
the
articles
which
had
been
collected
were
a
variety
of
spars
and
fragments
of
wood
some
of
the
small
sails
which
had
been
triced
up
in
the
rigging
one
or
two
casks
of
beef
and
pork
and
a
puncheon
of
rum
which
had
miraculously
steered
its
course
between
the
breakers
and
had
been
landed
without
injury
the
sails
which
had
been
spread
out
to
dry
were
first
carried
up
to
form
a
bed
for
the
sick
and
wounded
who
in
the
space
of
an
hour
were
all
made
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
admit
a
general
bed
having
been
made
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
upon
which
they
and
the
wounded
frenchmen
shared
the
sails
between
them
the
spars
and
fragments
were
then
brought
up
and
a
fire
made
in
the
long
deserted
hearth
while
another
was
lighted
outside
for
the
men
to
dry
their
clothes
the
cask
of
rum
was
rolled
up
to
the
door
and
a
portion
mixed
with
the
water
from
a
rill
that
trickled
down
the
sides
of
the
adjacent
mountain
served
out
to
the
exhausted
parties
the
seamen
stripping
off
their
clothes
and
spreading
them
out
to
dry
before
the
fire
which
had
been
made
outside
collected
into
the
hut
to
shield
their
naked
bodies
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
the
spirits
which
had
been
supplied
with
caution
to
the
survivors
of
the
french
vessel
had
been
eagerly
seized
by
the
one
who
had
first
addressed
our
hero
and
in
half
an
hour
he
seemed
to
be
quite
revived
he
rose
and
after
trying
his
limbs
by
moving
slowly
to
and
fro
gradually
recovered
the
entire
use
of
them
and
by
the
time
that
the
circulation
of
his
blood
had
been
thoroughly
restored
by
a
second
dose
of
spirits
appeared
to
have
little
to
complain
of
he
was
a
powerful
man
with
a
large
head
covered
with
a
profusion
of
shaggy
hair
seymour
looked
at
him
earnestly
and
thought
he
could
not
well
be
mistaken
long
as
it
was
since
they
had
been
in
company
excuse
me
but
i
think
we
once
met
at
cherbourg
is
not
your
name
debriseau
replied
the
frenchman
seizing
himself
by
the
hair
suis
and
who
are
you
oh
now
i
sure
it
you
replied
seymour
laughing
that
your
old
trick
do
you
not
recollect
the
boy
that
captain
mcelvina
took
off
the
wreck
mon
seymour
i
believe
midshipman
i
believe
cried
debriseau
donc
vous
mais
mon
dieu
que
again
pulling
his
hair
as
he
grinded
his
teeth
diable
de
and
how
is
it
that
you
have
been
on
board
of
a
french
how
oh
i
was
unlucky
after
mcelvina
went
away
and
i
thought
on
reflection
notwithstanding
his
arguments
that
it
was
a
dishonest
sort
of
concern
being
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
coasts
i
shipped
on
board
as
pilot
but
debriseau
are
you
not
a
native
of
guernsey
which
is
part
of
the
british
dominions
bah
it
all
one
we
islanders
are
like
the
bat
in
the
fable
beast
or
bird
as
it
suits
us
we
belong
to
either
country
for
my
own
part
i
have
a
strong
national
affection
for
the
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
boatswain
who
had
remained
outside
in
charge
of
the
cask
of
rum
upon
which
he
had
seated
himself
occupied
with
his
bible
here
assistance
coming
mr
seymour
there
at
least
twenty
or
thirty
men
descending
the
hill
hurrah
for
old
ireland
they
are
the
boys
that
will
look
after
a
friend
in
distress
shouted
conolly
one
of
the
seamen
who
thus
eulogised
his
own
countrymen
as
he
hung
naked
over
the
fire
chapter
fifty
six
with
dauntless
hardihood
and
brandish
blade
rush
on
him
and
shed
the
luscious
liquor
on
the
ground
though
he
and
his
cursed
crew
fierce
sign
of
battle
make
and
menace
high
milton
the
information
received
from
mr
hardsett
induced
our
hero
to
break
off
his
conversation
with
debriseau
and
he
immediately
quitted
the
hut
a
party
of
men
wild
in
their
appearance
and
demeanour
were
bounding
down
through
the
rocks
flourishing
their
bludgeons
over
their
heads
with
loud
shouts
they
soon
arrived
within
a
few
yards
of
the
shealing
and
to
the
astonishment
of
seymour
and
the
boatswain
who
with
a
dozen
more
had
resumed
their
clothes
seemed
to
eye
them
with
hostile
rather
than
with
friendly
glances
their
intentions
were
however
soon
manifested
by
their
pouncing
upon
the
habiliments
of
the
seamen
which
were
spread
out
to
dry
holding
them
rolled
up
under
one
arm
while
they
flourished
their
shillelahs
in
defiance
with
the
other
avast
there
my
lads
cried
the
boatswain
why
are
you
meddling
with
those
clothes
a
shout
with
confused
answers
in
irish
was
the
incomprehensible
reply
conolly
cried
seymour
you
can
speak
to
them
ask
them
what
they
mean
conolly
addressed
them
in
irish
when
an
exchange
of
a
few
sentences
took
place
bloody
end
to
the
rapparees
said
conolly
turning
to
our
hero
helping
themselves
they
instead
of
helping
us
they
say
all
that
comes
on
shore
from
a
wreck
is
their
own
by
right
and
that
have
it
they
asked
me
what
was
in
the
cask
and
i
told
them
it
was
the
cratur
sure
enough
and
they
say
that
they
must
have
it
and
everything
else
and
that
if
we
do
give
it
up
peaceably
they
take
the
lives
of
us
seymour
who
was
aware
that
the
surrender
of
the
means
of
intoxication
would
probably
lead
to
worse
results
turned
to
his
men
who
had
assembled
outside
of
the
hut
and
had
armed
themselves
with
spars
and
fragments
of
the
wreck
on
the
first
appearance
of
hostility
and
directed
them
to
roll
the
cask
of
rum
into
the
hut
and
prepare
to
act
on
the
defensive
the
english
seamen
indignant
at
such
violation
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
at
the
loss
of
their
clothes
immediately
complied
with
his
instructions
and
with
their
blood
boiling
were
with
difficulty
restrained
from
commencing
the
attack
a
monster
apparently
the
leader
of
the
hostile
party
again
addressed
conolly
in
his
own
language
it
to
know
whether
ye
give
up
the
cask
quietly
or
have
a
fight
for
it
the
devil
a
pair
of
trousers
will
they
give
back
not
even
my
own
though
i
an
irishman
and
a
galway
man
to
boot
by
jesus
mr
seymour
it
to
be
hoped
ye
not
give
up
the
cratur
without
a
bit
of
a
row
no
replied
seymour
tell
them
that
they
shall
not
have
it
and
that
they
shall
be
punished
for
the
theft
they
have
already
committed
you
to
come
and
take
it
roared
conolly
in
irish
to
the
opposing
party
now
my
lads
cried
seymour
you
must
fight
hard
for
it
they
will
show
little
mercy
if
they
gain
the
day
the
boatswain
returned
his
bible
to
his
breast
and
seizing
the
mast
of
the
frigate
which
had
been
thrown
up
with
the
other
spars
poised
it
with
both
hands
on
a
level
with
his
head
so
as
to
use
the
foot
of
it
as
a
and
stalked
before
his
men
the
irish
closed
with
loud
yells
and
the
affray
commenced
with
a
desperation
seldom
to
be
witnessed
many
were
the
wounds
given
and
received
and
several
of
either
party
were
levelled
in
the
dust
the
numbers
were
about
even
but
the
weapons
of
the
irish
were
of
a
better
description
each
man
being
provided
with
his
own
shillelah
of
hard
wood
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
wield
but
the
boatswain
did
great
execution
as
he
launched
forward
his
mast
and
prostrated
an
irishman
every
time
with
his
cool
and
aim
after
a
few
minutes
contention
the
englishmen
were
beaten
back
to
the
shealing
where
they
rallied
and
continued
to
stand
at
bay
seymour
anxious
at
all
events
that
the
irish
should
not
obtain
the
liquor
directed
robinson
the
captain
of
the
forecastle
to
go
into
the
hut
take
the
bung
out
of
the
cask
and
start
the
contents
this
order
was
obeyed
while
the
contest
was
continued
outside
till
mcdermot
the
leader
of
the
irish
called
off
his
men
that
they
might
recover
their
breath
for
a
renewal
of
the
attack
if
it
the
liquor
you
want
cried
conolly
to
them
by
the
direction
of
seymour
you
must
be
quick
about
it
there
it
all
running
away
through
the
doors
of
the
shealing
this
announcement
had
however
the
contrary
effect
to
that
which
seymour
intended
it
should
produce
enraged
at
the
loss
of
the
spirits
and
hoping
to
gain
possession
of
the
cask
before
it
was
all
out
the
irish
returned
with
renewed
violence
to
the
assault
and
drove
the
english
to
the
other
side
of
the
shealing
obtaining
possession
of
the
door
which
they
burst
into
to
secure
their
prey
about
eight
or
ten
had
entered
and
had
seized
upon
the
cask
which
was
not
more
than
half
emptied
when
the
liquor
which
had
run
out
under
the
door
of
the
hut
communicated
in
its
course
with
the
fire
that
had
been
kindled
outside
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
the
flame
ran
up
the
stream
that
continued
to
flow
igniting
the
whole
of
the
spirits
in
the
cask
which
blew
up
with
a
tremendous
explosion
darting
the
fiery
liquid
over
the
whole
interior
and
communicating
the
flame
to
the
thatch
and
every
part
of
the
building
which
was
instantaneously
in
ardent
combustion
the
shrieks
of
the
poor
disabled
wretches
stretched
on
the
sails
to
which
the
fire
had
communicated
and
who
were
now
lying
in
a
molten
sea
of
flame
like
that
described
in
pandemonium
by
milton
the
yells
of
the
irish
inside
of
the
hut
vainly
attempting
to
regain
the
door
as
they
writhed
in
their
flaming
apparel
which
like
the
shirt
of
nessus
ate
into
their
flesh
the
burning
thatch
which
had
been
precipitated
in
the
air
and
now
descended
in
fiery
flakes
upon
the
parties
outside
who
stood
aghast
at
the
dreadful
and
unexpected
catastrophe
the
volumes
of
black
and
suffocating
smoke
which
poured
out
from
every
quarter
formed
a
scene
of
horror
to
which
no
pen
can
do
adequate
justice
but
all
was
soon
over
the
shrieks
and
yells
had
yielded
to
suffocation
and
the
flames
in
their
fury
had
devoured
everything
with
such
rapidity
that
they
subsided
for
the
want
of
further
aliment
in
a
few
minutes
nothing
remained
but
the
smoking
walls
and
the
blackened
corpses
which
they
encircled
wretches
ye
had
escaped
the
lightning
blast
ye
had
been
rescued
from
the
swallowing
wave
and
little
thought
that
you
would
encounter
an
enemy
more
cruel
still
your
man
the
first
emotions
of
seymour
and
his
party
as
soon
as
they
had
recovered
from
the
horror
which
had
been
excited
by
the
catastrophe
were
those
of
pity
and
commiseration
but
their
reign
was
short
revenge
impatient
rose
and
threw
his
sword
in
thunder
down
the
smoking
ruins
formed
the
altar
at
which
he
received
their
vows
and
stimulated
them
to
the
sacrifice
of
further
victims
nor
did
he
fail
to
inspire
the
breasts
of
the
other
party
indignant
at
the
loss
of
their
companions
and
disappointed
at
the
destruction
of
what
they
so
ardently
coveted
debriseau
who
had
played
no
idle
game
in
the
previous
skirmish
was
the
first
who
rushed
to
the
attack
crying
out
with
all
the
theatrical
air
of
a
frenchman
which
never
deserts
him
even
in
the
agony
of
grief
braves
compagnons
vous
serez
he
flew
at
mcdermot
the
leader
of
the
irish
savages
a
brand
of
wood
with
which
he
aimed
at
mcdermot
head
broke
across
the
bludgeon
which
was
raised
to
ward
the
blow
debriseau
closed
and
clasping
his
arms
round
his
neck
tore
him
with
his
strong
teeth
with
the
power
and
ferocity
of
a
tiger
and
they
rolled
together
in
the
dust
covered
with
the
blood
which
poured
in
streams
and
struggling
for
mastery
and
life
an
american
one
of
the
crew
now
closed
in
the
same
way
with
another
of
the
irish
desperadoes
and
as
they
fell
together
twirling
the
on
the
temples
of
his
antagonist
round
his
fingers
to
obtain
a
fulcrum
to
his
lever
he
inserted
his
thumbs
into
the
sockets
of
his
eyes
forced
out
the
balls
of
vision
and
left
him
in
agony
and
in
darkness
the
sword
of
the
lord
roared
the
boatswain
as
he
fractured
the
skull
of
a
third
with
the
mast
of
the
boat
which
with
herculean
force
he
now
whirled
round
his
head
fight
you
fight
for
your
lives
cried
seymour
who
was
everywhere
in
advance
darting
the
still
burning
end
of
the
large
spar
into
the
faces
of
his
antagonists
who
recoiled
with
suffocation
and
pain
it
was
indeed
a
struggle
for
life
the
rage
of
each
had
mounted
to
delirium
the
english
sailors
stimulated
by
the
passions
of
the
moment
felt
neither
pain
nor
fatigue
from
their
previous
sufferings
the
want
of
weapons
had
been
supplied
by
their
clasp
knives
to
which
the
irish
had
also
resorted
and
deadly
wounds
were
given
and
received
mcdermot
the
irish
leader
had
just
gained
the
mastery
of
debriseau
bestriding
his
body
and
strangling
him
with
his
fingers
so
fixed
in
his
throat
that
they
seemed
deeply
to
have
entered
into
the
flesh
the
guernsey
man
was
black
in
the
face
and
his
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
have
been
no
more
when
the
mast
in
the
hands
of
the
boatswain
descended
upon
the
irishman
head
and
dashed
out
his
brains
at
the
same
moment
one
of
the
irishmen
darted
his
knife
into
the
side
of
seymour
who
fell
streaming
with
his
own
blood
the
fate
of
their
officer
which
excited
the
attention
of
the
seamen
and
the
fall
of
mcdermot
on
the
opposite
side
to
whose
assistance
the
irish
immediately
hastened
added
to
the
suspension
of
their
powers
from
want
of
breath
produced
a
temporary
cessation
of
hostilities
dragging
away
their
killed
and
wounded
the
panting
antagonists
retreated
to
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
from
each
other
tired
but
not
satisfied
with
their
revenge
and
fully
intending
to
resume
the
strife
as
soon
as
they
had
recovered
the
power
but
a
very
few
seconds
had
elapsed
when
they
were
interrupted
by
a
third
party
and
the
clattering
of
horses
hoofs
was
immediately
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
female
on
horseback
who
galloping
past
the
irishmen
reined
up
her
steed
throwing
him
on
his
haunches
in
his
full
career
in
the
space
between
the
late
contending
parties
is
the
daughter
of
the
house
exclaimed
the
irishmen
in
consternation
there
wanted
no
such
contrast
as
the
scene
described
to
add
lustre
to
her
beauty
or
to
enhance
her
charms
fair
as
the
her
cheeks
mantling
with
the
roseate
blush
of
exercise
and
animation
her
glossy
hair
partly
uncurled
and
still
played
with
by
the
amorous
breeze
hanging
in
long
ringlets
down
her
neck
her
eye
which
alternately
beamed
with
pity
or
flashed
with
indignation
as
it
was
directed
to
one
side
or
the
other
her
symmetry
of
form
which
the
close
displayed
her
graceful
movements
as
she
occasionally
restrained
her
grey
palfrey
who
fretted
to
resume
his
speed
all
combined
with
her
sudden
and
unexpected
appearance
to
induce
the
boatswain
and
his
men
to
consider
her
as
superhuman
she
an
angel
of
light
muttered
the
boatswain
to
himself
she
turned
to
the
irish
and
in
an
energetic
tone
addressed
them
in
their
own
dialect
what
she
had
said
was
unknown
to
the
english
party
but
the
effect
which
her
language
produced
was
immediate
their
weapons
were
thrown
aside
and
they
hung
down
their
heads
in
confusion
they
made
an
attempt
to
walk
away
but
a
few
words
from
her
induced
them
to
remain
the
fair
equestrian
was
now
joined
by
two
more
whose
pace
had
not
been
so
rapid
and
the
boatswain
who
had
been
contemplating
her
with
astonishment
as
she
was
addressing
the
irish
now
that
she
was
about
to
turn
towards
him
recollected
that
some
of
his
men
were
not
exactly
in
a
costume
to
meet
a
lady
eye
he
raised
his
call
to
his
mouth
and
with
a
sonorous
whistle
cried
out
all
you
without
trousers
behind
shealing
hoy
an
order
immediately
obeyed
by
the
men
who
had
been
deprived
of
their
habiliments
conolly
who
had
understood
the
conversation
which
had
taken
place
called
out
in
irish
at
the
same
time
as
he
walked
round
behind
the
walls
i
think
ye
be
after
giving
us
our
duds
now
ye
dirty
spalpeens
so
bring
wid
you
quick
a
request
which
was
immediately
complied
with
the
clothes
being
collected
by
two
of
the
irish
and
taken
to
the
men
who
had
retired
behind
the
walls
of
the
shealing
mr
hardsett
was
not
long
in
replying
to
her
interrogations
and
in
giving
her
an
outline
of
the
tragical
events
which
had
occurred
while
the
ladies
trembling
with
pity
and
emotion
listened
to
the
painful
narrative
are
you
the
only
officer
then
of
the
frigate
that
is
left
no
madam
replied
the
boatswain
the
is
here
but
there
he
lies
poor
fellow
desperately
wounded
by
these
men
from
whom
we
expected
to
have
had
relief
what
was
the
name
of
your
frigate
the
captain
m
o
heaven
cried
the
girl
catching
at
the
collar
of
the
coat
in
her
trepidation
and
the
wounded
officer
name
seymour
a
cry
of
anguish
and
horror
escaped
from
all
the
party
as
the
beautiful
interrogatress
tottered
in
her
seat
and
then
fell
off
into
the
arms
of
the
boatswain
in
a
few
seconds
recovering
herself
she
regained
her
feet
quick
quick
lead
me
to
him
supported
by
hardsett
she
tottered
to
the
spot
where
seymour
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
faint
and
exhausted
with
loss
of
blood
attended
by
robinson
and
debriseau
she
knelt
down
by
his
side
and
taking
his
hand
which
she
pressed
between
her
own
called
him
by
his
name
seymour
started
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
opened
his
eyes
and
in
the
beauteous
form
which
was
reclining
over
him
beheld
his
dear
dear
emily
chapter
fifty
seven
ah
me
what
perils
do
environ
the
man
that
meddles
with
cold
iron
what
plaguey
mischiefs
and
mishaps
to
dog
him
still
with
hudibras
the
melancholy
loss
of
lives
which
we
have
detailed
occurred
upon
a
reef
of
rocks
close
to
cape
on
the
coast
of
galway
and
not
four
miles
from
the
castle
and
property
held
by
mr
rainscourt
the
intelligence
had
been
communicated
to
mcelvina
by
some
of
his
tenants
early
in
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
the
survivors
had
gained
the
shore
the
western
gales
sweeping
the
atlantic
and
blowing
with
such
fury
on
the
coast
would
not
permit
any
vegetation
or
culture
so
near
the
beach
but
when
once
past
the
range
of
hills
which
exposed
their
rugged
sides
as
barriers
to
the
blast
the
land
was
of
good
quality
and
thickly
tenanted
the
people
were
barbarous
to
an
excess
and
as
they
had
stated
claimed
a
traditionary
right
to
whatever
property
might
be
thrown
up
from
the
numerous
wrecks
which
took
place
upon
the
dangerous
and
coast
this
will
account
for
the
tragical
events
of
the
day
when
mcelvina
was
informed
of
vessels
having
been
stranded
he
immediately
went
up
to
the
castle
to
procure
the
means
of
assistance
which
were
always
held
there
in
readiness
and
as
many
of
people
as
could
be
collected
this
however
required
some
little
delay
and
emily
shocked
at
the
imperfect
intelligence
which
had
been
conveyed
to
her
determined
to
ride
down
immediately
in
company
with
mrs
mcelvina
and
a
young
friend
who
was
staying
with
her
during
her
father
absence
on
their
arrival
at
the
of
hills
the
explosion
of
the
shealing
and
subsequent
conflict
between
the
parties
met
their
eyes
emily
fears
and
knowledge
of
the
irish
peasantry
immediately
suggested
the
cause
and
aware
of
her
influence
with
the
rainscourt
tenants
she
made
all
the
haste
that
the
roads
would
permit
to
arrive
at
the
spot
galloping
down
the
hill
in
so
bold
and
dexterous
a
style
that
her
companions
neither
could
nor
would
have
dared
to
keep
pace
with
her
how
fortunate
was
her
arrival
need
hardly
be
observed
as
in
all
probability
the
english
seamen
would
eventually
have
been
sacrificed
to
the
cupidity
and
resentment
of
the
natives
william
do
you
know
me
whispered
emily
as
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
and
her
countenance
betrayed
the
anguish
of
her
mind
seymour
pressed
the
small
white
hand
that
trembled
in
his
own
and
a
faint
smile
illuminated
his
features
but
the
excitement
at
the
appearance
of
emily
was
too
great
the
blood
again
gushed
from
his
wound
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
fell
on
his
shoulder
as
he
swooned
from
the
loss
of
blood
oh
god
preserve
him
cried
emily
clasping
her
hands
and
raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
then
sinking
down
in
mental
and
fervent
prayer
my
dear
mcelvina
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
at
last
said
susan
bursting
into
tears
look
at
whose
side
emily
is
kneeling
is
william
seymour
dying
seymour
cried
mcelvina
who
had
but
that
moment
arrived
but
aware
of
the
importance
of
prompt
assistance
he
called
for
the
basket
containing
the
restoratives
and
gently
removing
emily
he
took
her
situation
by
the
side
of
our
wounded
hero
to
strip
off
his
clothes
examine
the
wound
bandage
it
so
as
to
prevent
a
further
loss
of
blood
and
pour
down
his
throat
some
diluted
wine
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
seymour
who
had
only
fainted
reopened
his
eyes
and
soon
showed
the
good
effects
of
presence
of
mind
mcelvina
is
it
not
did
not
i
see
emily
yes
you
did
my
dear
fellow
but
keep
quiet
i
do
not
think
your
wound
is
dangerous
i
am
better
now
mcelvina
much
better
but
i
must
see
emily
mcelvina
thought
it
advisable
to
accede
to
his
wish
and
returned
to
his
wife
who
was
supporting
the
fainting
girl
a
glass
of
water
the
assurance
that
seymour
would
do
well
if
not
too
much
agitated
and
a
promise
exacted
from
her
to
say
but
little
was
followed
by
an
interview
which
had
a
reviving
effect
upon
both
medical
practitioners
who
dive
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
human
frame
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
who
search
through
the
mineral
and
vegetable
kingdom
for
relief
when
will
you
produce
a
balm
so
healing
a
specific
so
powerful
an
elixir
so
instantaneous
or
restorative
as
joy
mcelvina
was
in
the
meantime
occupied
in
preparations
for
removing
the
wounded
and
portioning
out
food
and
necessaries
to
the
rest
of
the
party
when
he
beheld
the
sad
relics
in
the
shealing
and
heard
from
the
boatswain
the
tragical
events
of
the
day
his
indignation
was
beyond
bounds
seven
frenchmen
fifteen
englishmen
and
eight
irishmen
had
been
burnt
alive
three
englishmen
and
five
irishmen
had
been
killed
in
the
affray
making
independently
of
many
severely
wounded
a
total
of
who
had
perished
on
this
disastrous
morning
the
irish
who
had
attacked
them
were
all
tenants
of
the
property
belonging
either
to
him
or
rainscourt
an
immediate
notice
to
quit
was
given
to
them
on
the
spot
and
the
dreadful
word
emigration
thundered
in
their
ears
this
brought
them
on
their
knees
with
such
crying
and
beseeching
such
uncouth
and
ridiculous
gestures
as
almost
to
create
a
laugh
among
the
english
seamen
who
were
witnesses
to
the
scene
well
if
them
ai
funny
beggars
i
be
blowed
cried
one
of
the
english
seamen
just

or
all

there
never
a
good
turn
they
wo
do

now
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
there
would
have
been
this
but
to
continue
the
bodies
of
the
dead
in
the
shealing
were
consigned
to
the
earth
as
they
lay
the
four
walls
composing
a
mausoleum
where
animosity
was
buried
the
corpses
of
mcdermot
and
the
irish
who
had
been
killed
in
the
conflict
were
removed
by
their
friends
that
they
might
be
waked
by
the
direction
of
mcelvina
the
wounded
english
were
carried
up
by
their
former
antagonists
to
the
small
town
at
the
foot
of
the
castle
where
surgical
assistance
was
to
be
obtained
seymour
was
placed
on
a
sort
of
bier
that
had
been
constructed
for
him
emily
and
her
companions
riding
by
his
side
and

up

hill

mr
hardsett
and
the
remainder
of
the
english
crew
in
two
hours
all
were
at
their
respective
destinations
and
seymour
who
had
been
examined
by
the
surgeon
upon
his
arrival
at
the
castle
and
whose
wound
had
been
pronounced
by
no
means
dangerous
was
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
susan
and
emily
watching
by
his
side
debriseau
who
had
recognised
his
quondam
friend
mcelvina
and
perceived
by
his
appearance
and
the
respect
that
was
shown
to
him
that
he
had
been
more
fortunate
in
his
career
since
they
had
parted
than
he
had
himself
from
a
proud
feeling
of
the
moment
did
not
make
himself
known
that
mcelvina
who
had
no
idea
of
meeting
him
in
such
a
quarter
should
not
in
the
hurry
of
the
scene
distinguish
his
former
associate
covered
as
he
was
with
dust
and
blood
and
having
the
appearance
more
of
a
new
zealand
warrior
than
of
any
other
living
being
was
not
surprising
and
debriseau
joined
the
english
party
in
the
rear
of
the
cavalcade
and
remained
with
them
at
the
town
while
mcelvina
and
the
rest
of
the
cortege
continued
their
route
to
the
castle
with
the
wounded
seymour
as
soon
as
our
hero
wound
had
been
dressed
and
the
favourable
opinion
of
the
surgeon
had
been
pronounced
mcelvina
rode
down
to
the
town
to
make
arrangements
for
the
board
and
lodging
of
the
english
seamen
it
was
then
that
he
was
asked
by
mr
hardsett
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
frenchman
who
had
been
saved
where
is
he
demanded
mcelvina
debriseau
was
summoned
to
the
magistrate
and
having
cleaned
himself
of
the
dust
and
gore
was
immediately
recognised
debriseau
exclaimed
mcelvina
with
astonishment
and
a
look
of
displeasure
even
so
captain
mcelvina
replied
debriseau
haughtily
you
do
not
seem
very
well
pleased
at
meeting
an
old
acquaintance
captain
debriseau
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
step
on
one
side
with
me
i
will
honest
with
you
continued
mcelvina
to
the
guernseyman
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
boatswain
and
the
rest
and
confess
that
although
i
wish
you
well
i
was
not
pleased
at
meeting
with
you
here
you
addressed
me
as
captain
mcelvina
that
title
has
long
been
dropped
i
did
once
confide
to
you
the
secret
of
my
former
life
and
will
own
what
i
little
imagined
at
the
time
that
i
have
in
consequence
put
it
into
your
power
to
do
me
serious
injury
you
must
now
listen
to
me
while
i
give
you
a
sketch
of
my
memoirs
from
the
time
that
we
parted
at
cherbourg
mcelvina
then
entered
into
a
short
history
of
what
the
reader
is
acquainted
judge
then
debriseau
pursued
he
if
after
what
has
passed
i
could
say
that
i
was
glad
to
see
you
who
not
only
by
your
presence
reminded
me
of
my
former
irregularities
but
had
the
means
if
you
thought
proper
of
acquainting
my
friends
and
acquaintances
with
what
i
wish
i
could
forget
myself
captain
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
mcelvina
replied
debriseau
with
dignity
i
will
be
as
honest
as
you
i
am
here
without
a
sou
and
without
a
shirt
and
when
i
leave
this
i
know
not
where
to
lay
my
hand
upon
either
but
rather
than
betray
a
confidence
reposed
in
me
rather
than
injure
one
who
always
was
my
friend
or
what
is
still
more
unworthy
attempt
to
work
upon
your
fears
to
my
own
advantage
i
would
suffer
death
nay
more
i
would
sooner
turn
officer
no
no
mcelvina
suis
francais
bah
i
mean
i
am
a
true
englishman
never
mind
what
i
am
all
countries
are
alike
if
a
man
heart
is
in
the
right
place
i
sincerely
wish
you
joy
of
your
good
fortune
and
know
nobody
that
in
my
opinion
deserves
it
more
i
shall
go
to
prison
with
some
resignation
now
that
i
know
you
have
been
so
fortunate
and
do
me
not
the
injustice
to
imagine
that
you
will
ever
be
troubled
by
either
seeing
or
hearing
from
me
i
waited
for
this
answer
debriseau
had
you
made
any
other
i
would
have
run
the
risk
and
defied
you
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
have
offered
to
bribe
your
silence
but
i
rejoice
in
your
honest
and
manly
conduct
is
the
best
policy
debriseau
i
can
now
offer
and
you
can
accept
without
blushing
on
either
side
that
assistance
which
i
have
both
the
power
and
will
to
grant
there
is
no
occasion
for
your
going
to
prison
i
make
the
returns
as
magistrate
and
as
you
are
an
english
subject
will
be
answerable
for
the
omission
we
are
too
far
from
the
world
here
to
have
any
questions
asked
and
now
let
me
know
how
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
for
my
purse
and
interest
you
may
command
well
then
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
fit
for
nothing
on
shore
i
must
have
another
vessel
if
i
can
get
one
not
a
smuggling
vessel
i
hope
replied
mcelvina
gravely
i
should
prefer
it
certainly
why
there
no
harm
in
smuggling
if
i
recollect
your
arguments
right
replied
debriseau
smiling
do
you
remember
the
night
that
you
convinced
me
i
do
very
well
said
mcelvina
but
i
have
reconsidered
the
subject
and
i
have
one
little
remark
to
make
which
will
upset
the
whole
theory
which
is
that
other
people
acting
wrong
can
not
be
urged
as
an
excuse
for
our
own
conduct
if
it
were
the
world
would
soon
be
left
without
virtue
or
honesty
you
may
think
me
scrupulous
but
i
am
sincere
can
not
you
hit
upon
something
else
why
i
should
have
no
objection
to
command
a
fine
merchant
vessel
if
i
could
obtain
such
a
thing
that
you
shall
replied
mcelvina
and
to
make
sure
of
it
and
render
you
more
independent
you
shall
be
part
owner
consider
it
as
affaire
and
now
allow
me
to
offer
you
the
means
of
improving
your
personal
appearance
i
presume
the
leathern
bag
is
empty
bah
a
long
while
ago
after
i
had
lost
my
vessel
i
made
up
to
mademoiselle
picardon
i
thought
it
would
not
be
a
bad
speculation
but
she
never
forgave
me
kicking
that
dirty
puppy
down
stairs
little
beast
ah
you
forget
some
of
my
remarks
replied
mcelvina
laughing
me
love
my
dog
now
oblige
me
by
accepting
this
and
debriseau
excuse
me
there
a
capital
barber
in
this
street
chapter
fifty
eight
under
his
lordship
leave
all
must
be
mine
middleton
the
first
moments
of
leisure
that
mcelvina
could
obtain
from
his
duties
were
employed
in
writing
to
the
vicar
informing
him
of
the
reappearance
of
seymour
under
such
peculiar
circumstances
and
requesting
his
immediate
presence
that
our
hero
claims
to
the
property
of
admiral
de
courcy
might
be
established
as
before
observed
rainscourt
was
not
at
the
castle
nor
was
he
expected
for
some
days
having
accepted
an
invitation
to
join
a
shooting
party
some
miles
distant
a
letter
was
despatched
to
him
by
his
daughter
detailing
the
circumstances
of
the
shipwreck
stating
that
the
wounded
officer
was
in
the
castle
and
that
in
consequence
until
his
return
mrs
mcelvina
would
remain
as
her
companion
although
the
wound
that
seymour
had
received
had
been
pronounced
by
the
surgeon
not
to
be
of
a
dangerous
tendency
still
he
did
not
recover
so
rapidly
as
might
have
been
expected
from
his
youth
and
excellent
constitution
the
fact
was
that
all
his
love
for
emily
who
was
constantly
at
his
side
and
could
not
conceal
her
regard
for
him
had
returned
with
tenfold
violence
the
same
honourable
principle
which
had
before
decided
him
that
of
not
taking
advantage
of
her
prepossession
in
his
favour
and
permitting
her
to
throw
away
herself
and
her
large
fortune
upon
one
of
unknown
parentage
and
penniless
condition
militated
against
his
passion
and
caused
such
a
tumult
of
contending
feelings
as
could
not
but
affect
a
person
in
his
weak
state
a
slow
fever
came
on
which
retarded
the
cure
and
even
threatened
more
serious
consequences
madame
de
stael
has
truly
observed
that
love
occupies
the
whole
life
of
a
woman
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
women
should
be
more
skilful
in
detecting
the
symptoms
of
it
in
others
mrs
mcelvina
with
the
usual
penetration
of
her
sex
discovered
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
seymour
and
communicated
her
suspicions
to
her
husband
as
for
some
days
the
health
of
our
hero
rather
declined
than
improved
mcelvina
determined
to
entrust
him
with
the
secret
of
his
birth
which
by
removing
all
difficulties
he
imagined
would
produce
a
beneficial
effect
but
there
was
one
point
which
mcelvina
could
not
conceal
from
our
hero
which
was
the
melancholy
fact
of
his
father
having
under
an
assumed
name
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
offended
laws
of
his
country
and
the
knowledge
of
this
had
so
serious
an
effect
upon
seymour
as
almost
to
neutralise
the
joy
arising
from
the
rest
of
the
communication
the
first
question
which
he
asked
himself
was
whether
emily
would
or
ought
to
marry
a
man
whose
father
had
perished
by
so
ignominious
a
death
and
now
that
all
other
impediments
to
his
making
her
an
offer
of
his
hand
were
removed
whether
that
circumstance
alone
would
not
be
an
insuperable
bar
to
their
union
agitated
by
these
conflicting
doubts
seymour
passed
a
sleepless
night
and
on
the
ensuing
morning
his
fever
had
alarmingly
increased
this
was
observed
by
the
surgeon
who
stated
that
he
could
not
account
for
it
except
by
supposing
that
there
was
something
heavy
on
the
mind
of
his
patient
which
unless
removed
would
retard
if
not
prevent
recovery
susan
who
with
her
husband
had
imagined
that
the
disclosure
which
had
taken
place
would
have
had
a
beneficial
effect
hastened
to
the
sick
chamber
and
soon
persuaded
our
hero
to
make
her
a
confidant
of
his
doubts
and
fears
there
is
but
one
who
can
satisfy
you
on
that
point
my
dear
william
replied
she
for
although
i
feel
convinced
that
i
can
answer
for
her
it
is
not
exactly
a
case
of
proxy
mcelvina
will
be
here
directly
and
then
i
will
obtain
his
permission
to
disclose
the
whole
to
emily
and
you
will
have
the
answer
from
her
own
lips
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
emily
was
made
acquainted
with
the
eventful
history
of
our
hero
birth
and
parentage
of
her
no
longer
being
an
heiress
of
his
ardent
love
for
her
and
of
the
fears
that
he
entertained
upon
the
subject
i
am
only
sorry
for
one
thing
replied
emily
that
he
did
not
ask
me
to
marry
him
when
i
thought
that
i
was
an
heiress
now
if
i
accept
him
i
am
afraid
it
may
be
thought
oh
if
you
knew
how
i
have
loved
him
how
i
have
thought
of
him
when
far
away
cried
the
sobbing
girl
you
would
not
no
one
would
think
me
capable
of
interested
i
am
so
glad
the
property
is
his
continued
emily
looking
and
smiling
through
her
tears
why
my
dear
emily
if
you
begin
to
make
difficulties
we
shall
be
worse
than
ever
there
never
was
a
more
fortunate
occurrence
than
this
attachment
between
you
and
seymour
it
reconciles
all
difficulties
puts
an
end
to
all
chancery
suits
and
will
shower
general
happiness
when
some
at
least
must
have
been
made
miserable
come
with
me
william
is
very
feverish
this
morning
you
only
can
do
him
good
mrs
mcelvina
led
the
agitated
girl
into
the
sick
chamber
and
whispering
to
seymour
that
emily
knew
all
and
that
all
was
well
was
so
very
imprudent
as
to
allow
her
feelings
to
overcome
her
sense
of
chaperonism
and
left
them
together
i
am
aware
that
i
now
have
a
fair
opportunity
of
inserting
a
most
interesting
conversation
full
of
and
and
etcetera
which
would
be
much
relished
by
all
misses
of
seventeen
or
thereabouts
but
as
i
do
not
write
novels
for
them
and
the
young
couple
have
no
secrets
to
which
the
reader
is
not
already
a
party
i
shall
leave
them
to
imagine
the
explanation
with
all
its
concomitant
retrospections
and
anticipations
softened
with
tears
and
sweetened
with
kisses
and
as
the
plot
now
thickens
change
the
scene
to
the
of
rainscourt
who
had
now
just
risen
at
his
usual
hour
between
two
and
three
in
the
afternoon
his
french
valet
is
in
attendance
shaving
him
and
dressing
his
hair
and
communicating
what
little
intelligence
he
has
been
enabled
to
collect
for
his
amusement
monsieur
has
not
seen
the
young
officer
who
was
wounded
no
i
wonder
why
they
brought
him
up
here
what
sort
of
a
person
is
he
un
joli
garcon
monsieur
avec
bien
i
carried
in
the
water
this
morning
when
his
wound
was
dressed
for
i
had
the
curiosity
to
see
him
un
diable
de
and
the
young
officer
has
a
very
singular
mark
on
his
right
shoulder
like
pied
du
rainscourt
started
under
the
operation
of
the
razor
he
remembered
the
mark
of
the
grandchild
so
minutely
described
by
the
vicar
monsieur
ce
pas
ma
said
the
valet
applying
a
napkin
to
stanch
the
blood
which
flowed
from
his
master
cheek
it
was
not
replied
rainscourt
recovering
himself
i
had
a
slight
spasm
the
operation
was
continued
and
fortunately
had
just
been
finished
when
the
valet
resumed
monsieur
le
vicaire
de
il
est
arrive
hier
au
on
a
visit
to
mr
mcelvina
the
devil
he
is
replied
rainscourt
springing
from
his
chair
at
the
corroborating
incident
to
his
previous
ground
of
alarm
the
astonished
countenance
of
the
valet
restored
the
master
to
his
senses
bring
me
my
coffee
i
am
nervous
this
morning
but
rainscourt
had
not
long
to
endure
suspense
he
had
barely
finished
his
toilet
when
he
was
informed
that
the
vicar
mcelvina
and
some
other
gentlemen
were
below
and
wished
to
speak
to
him
rainscourt
anxious
to
know
the
worst
descended
to
the
library
where
he
found
the
parties
before
mentioned
accompanied
by
debriseau
and
a
legal
gentleman
we
shall
not
enter
into
details
to
the
dismay
of
rainscourt
the
identity
of
our
hero
was
established
beyond
all
doubt
and
he
felt
convinced
that
eventually
he
should
be
forced
to
surrender
up
the
property
his
indignation
was
chiefly
levelled
at
mcelvina
whom
he
considered
as
the
occasion
of
the
whole
not
only
from
having
rescued
our
hero
from
the
wreck
but
because
it
was
by
his
assertions
corroborated
by
debriseau
that
the
chain
of
evidence
was
clearly
substantiated
mcelvina
who
from
long
acquaintance
had
a
feeling
towards
rainscourt
which
his
conduct
did
not
deserve
waited
only
for
his
acknowledgment
of
our
hero
claim
to
communicate
the
circumstance
of
the
attachment
between
the
young
people
which
would
have
barred
all
further
proceedings
and
have
settled
it
in
an
amicable
arrangement
well
gentlemen
observed
rainscourt
if
you
can
satisfactorily
prove
in
a
court
of
justice
all
you
have
now
stated
i
shall
of
course
bow
to
its
decision
but
you
must
excuse
me
if
out
of
regard
to
my
daughter
i
resist
until
the
assertions
can
be
substantiated
on
oath
you
can
not
expect
otherwise
we
do
not
expect
otherwise
mr
rainscourt
replied
mcelvina
but
we
think
it
will
not
be
necessary
that
it
should
go
into
court
mr
mcelvina
interrupted
rainscourt
angrily
i
wish
no
observations
from
you
after
your
intimacy
with
the
family
particularly
with
my
daughter
who
by
your
means
will
probably
forfeit
all
her
prospects
i
consider
your
conduct
base
and
treacherous
excuse
my
ringing
the
bell
for
the
servant
to
show
you
the
door
mcelvina
turned
pale
with
rage
then
sir
you
shall
have
no
suggestions
from
me
come
gentlemen
we
will
retire
continued
mcelvina
now
determined
that
rainscourt
should
be
left
in
ignorance
for
the
present
and
the
parties
quitted
the
room
little
contemplating
that
such
direful
consequences
would
ensue
from
this
trifling
altercation
chapter
fifty
nine
was
there
ever
seen
such
villany
so
neatly
plotted
and
so
well
performed
both
held
in
hand
and
flatly
both
beguiled
jew
of
malta
the
feelings
of
rainscourt
were
worked
up
to
desperation
and
madness
as
soon
as
the
party
had
quitted
the
room
he
paced
up
and
down
clenching
his
fists
and
throwing
them
in
the
air
as
his
blood
boiled
against
mcelvina
whom
he
considered
as
his
mortal
enemy
to
send
him
a
challenge
with
the
double
view
of
removing
him
and
his
testimony
and
at
the
same
time
of
glutting
his
own
revenge
was
the
idea
that
floated
uppermost
in
his
confused
and
heated
brain
to
surrender
up
the
estates
to
be
liable
for
the
personal
property
which
he
had
squandered
to
sink
at
once
from
affluence
to
absolute
pauperism
if
not
to
incarceration
it
was
impossible
he
continued
his
rapid
movement
to
and
fro
dividing
his
thoughts
between
revenge
and
suicide
when
a
tap
at
the
door
roused
him
from
his
gloomy
reveries
it
was
the
surgeon
who
attended
seymour
he
came
to
pay
his
respects
and
make
a
report
of
his
patient
health
to
rainscourt
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
return
to
the
castle
your
most
obedient
sir
i
am
sorry
that
my
patient
was
not
so
well
when
i
saw
him
this
morning
i
hope
to
find
him
better
when
i
go
upstairs
oh
replied
rainscourt
a
faint
gleam
of
deliverance
from
his
dilemmas
shining
upon
his
dark
and
troubled
mind
yes
indeed
replied
the
medical
gentleman
who
like
many
others
made
the
most
of
his
cases
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
services
like
tom
thumb
who
made
the
giants
first
and
then
killed
them
a
great
deal
of
fever
indeed
i
do
not
like
the
symptoms
but
we
must
see
what
we
can
do
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
chance
of
his
not
recovering
asked
rainscourt
with
emphasis
it
hard
to
say
sir
many
much
worse
have
recovered
and
many
not
so
ill
have
been
taken
off
if
the
fever
abates
all
will
go
well
if
it
does
not
we
must
hope
for
the
best
replied
the
surgeon
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
then
he
might
die
of
the
wound
and
fever
attending
it
most
certainly
he
might
he
might
be
carried
off
in
hours
thank
you
for
your
visit
mr
b
replied
rainscourt
who
did
not
wish
for
his
further
company
good
morning
good
morning
sir
replied
the
surgeon
as
rainscourt
politely
bowed
him
out
of
the
room
rainscourt
again
paced
up
and
down
he
might
die
of
this
fever
and
wound
in
hours
there
could
be
nothing
surprising
in
it
and
as
he
cogitated
the
demon
entered
his
soul
he
sat
down
and
pressed
his
hands
to
his
burning
temples
as
he
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
many
minutes
perplexed
in
a
chaotic
labyrinth
of
evil
thoughts
till
the
fiend
pointed
out
the
path
which
must
be
pursued
he
summoned
the
old
nurse
those
who
have
lived
in
or
are
acquainted
with
the
peculiarities
and
customs
of
the
sister
kingdom
must
know
that
the
attachment
of
the
lower
irish
to
their
masters
amounts
to
almost
norah
had
nursed
rainscourt
at
her
breast
and
remaining
in
the
family
had
presided
over
the
cradle
of
emily
adhering
to
rainscourt
in
his
poverty
and
now
in
the
winter
of
her
days
basking
in
the
sun
of
his
prosperity
the
blessings
of
the
day
upon
the
master
said
the
old
woman
as
she
entered
rainscourt
locked
the
door
norah
said
he
i
have
bad
news
to
tell
you
are
you
aware
that
the
castle

no
longer
mine

castle

longer

replied
the
old
woman
opening
her
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
that
i
am
a
beggar
and
shall
be
sent
to
prison
the
master
to
prison
och
hone
that
my
daughter
is

a
few
days
and

young

life
we
are
saving
so
much
for
gratitude
gratitude
och
hone
and
so
young
and
so
beautiful
too
as
he
is
but
he
may
die
norah
sure
enough

replied
the
old
woman
brightening
up
at
the
idea
it
a
bad
fever
that
on
him
and
he
may
recover
norah
sure
enough
he
may

replied
she
mournfully
he
but
young
blood
now
norah
do
you
love
your
master
do
you
love
your
young
mistress
do
i
love
the
master
and
the
mistress
replied
the
old
woman
indignantly
and
it
you
that
after
asking
me
such
a
question
can
you
bear
to
see
us
turned
out
of
house
and
home
to
be
cast
on
the
wide
world
with
poverty
and
rags
will
you
permit
it
when
by
assisting
me
you
can
prevent
it
can
i
bear
it
will
i
assist
tell
me
the
thing
that
you
have
me
do
that
all
i
said
that
the
wounded
person
might
norah
he
die
the
old
woman
looked
up
earnestly
at
rainscourt
face
as
if
to
understand
him
i
see
then
remaining
with
her
head
down
for
some
time
as
if
in
cogitation
she
again
looked
up
will
father
give
me
absolution
for
that
he
will
he
shall
i
will
pay
for
ten
thousand
masses
for
your
soul
over
and
above
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
so
young
and
so
beautiful
too
think
over
it
i
never
sleep
much
now
the
rats
are
so
troublesome
rats
cried
rainscourt
why
not
get
some
arsenic
arsenic
echoed
the
old
woman
is
it
arsenic
for
the
rats
you
mean
yes
replied
rainscourt
significantly
for
all
sorts
of
rats
those
who
would
undermine
the
foundation
of
an
ancient
house
sure
it
an
old
house
that
of
the
rainscourts
replied
the
nurse
but
i
giddy
a
little
i
think
a
bit
in
a
second
or
two
her
face
brightened
up
a
little
why
do
you
marry
the
two
together
such
a
handsome
couple
as
they
be
marry
you
old
fool
do
you
think
now
that
he
is
aware
that
all
the
property
is
his
that
he
would
marry
emily
without
a
sixpence
no
no
true
and
it
the
arsenic
you
want
then
and
you
sure
that
the
priest
will
give
absolution
sure
replied
rainscourt
out
of
patience
come
to
me
at
daylight
morning
well
i
think
about
it
when
i
and
so
young
and
so
beautiful
too
och
hone
murmured
the
old
woman
as
she
unlocked
the
door
and
with
tremulous
gait
quitted
the
room
rainscourt
left
to
himself
again
became
the
prey
to
conflicting
passions
although
his
conscience
had
long
been
proof
against
any
remorse
at
the
commission
of
the
crimes
which
stained
the
earth
yet
it
recoiled
at
meditated
murder
more
than
once
he
determined
to
leave
it
all
to
chance
and
if
seymour
did
recover
to
fly
the
country
with
all
the
money
he
could
raise
but
the
devil
had
possession
and
was
not
to
be
cast
out
the
door
was
again
opened
and
emily
radiant
with
happiness
after
the
interview
with
seymour
in
which
she
had
plighted
and
received
the
troth
of
her
beloved
entered
the
room
my
dear
father
mr
seymour
is
so
much
better
this
evening
would
he
were
in
his
grave
replied
rainscourt
bitterly
emily
had
come
in
at
the
request
of
seymour
to
state
to
her
father
what
had
taken
place
but
this
violent
exclamation
deterred
her
she
thought
that
it
was
not
a
favourable
moment
and
she
retired
wishing
him
good
night
with
no
small
degree
of
indignation
expressed
in
her
countenance
at
his
iniquitous
wish
she
retired
to
her
chamber
her
anger
was
soon
chased
away
by
the
idea
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
her
father
was
so
irritated
and
that
all
would
be
well
bending
to
her
creator
in
gratitude
and
love
and
not
forgetting
seymour
in
her
orisons
she
laid
her
head
upon
her
pillow
and
visions
of
future
happiness
filled
her
dreams
in
uninterrupted
succession
enjoy
them
beautiful
and
innocent
one
revel
in
them
if
it
were
possible
to
satiety
for
they
are
thy
last
enjoyment
how
much
would
the
misery
of
this
world
be
increased
if
we
were
permitted
to
dive
into
futurity
the
life
of
a
man
is
a
pilgrimage
in
error
and
in
darkness
the
that
he
always
pursues
always
deceives
him
yet
he
is
warned
in
vain
at
the
moment
of
disappointment
he
resolves
sees
another
and
pursues
again
the
fruit
is
turned
to
ashes
in
his
mouth
at
the
fancied
moment
of
enjoyment
warning
succeeds
warning
disappointment
is
followed
up
by
disappointment
every
grey
hair
in
his
head
may
be
considered
as
a
sad
memento
of
yet
useless
experience
still
he
continues
spurred
on
by
hope
anticipating
everything
in
pursuit
of
nothing
until
he
stumbles
into
his
grave
and
all
is
over
little
did
mcelvina
and
the
vicar
think
what
the
consequences
would
be
of
their
leaving
rainscourt
in
his
wrath
little
did
rainscourt
and
the
nurse
imagine
how
dreadful
and
how
futile
would
be
the
results
of
their
wicked
intentions
little
did
the
enamoured
and
guileless
pair
who
now
slumbered
in
anticipated
bliss
contemplate
what
in
the
parturition
of
time
the
morrow
would
bring
forth
early
in
the
morning
rainscourt
who
was
awake
and
who
had
not
taken
off
his
clothes
was
startled
by
a
low
tapping
at
his
door
it
was
the
nurse
well
said
rainscourt
hastily
have
you
procured
what
we
were
talking
of
i
have
indeed
but
no
buts
norah
or
we
part
for
ever
where
is
it
who
is
with
him
one
of
the
women
i
tould
her
i
would
nurse
him
after
daylight
when
does
he
take
his
fever
draughts
every
two
hours
och
hone
he
take
but
one
so
young
and
so
beautiful
too
silence
fool
go
and
send
the
other
woman
to
bed
and
then
bring
in
one
of
the
draughts
the
old
nurse
turned
back
as
she
was
hobbling
away
and
the
absolution
away
and
do
as
i
order
you
cried
rainscourt
with
violence
blessed
jesus
do
talk
so
loud
it
the
whole
house
will
hear
you
said
the
hag
beseechingly
as
she
left
the
room
she
returned
with
the
draught
rainscourt
poured
in
the
powder
and
shook
it
with
desperation
now
this
is
the
first
draught
he
must
take
give
it
him
directly
och
hone
cried
the
old
woman
as
she
received
the
vial
in
her
trembling
hands
go
and
come
back
and
tell
me
when
he
has
taken
it
norah
left
the
room
rainscourt
waited
her
return
in
a
state
of
mind
so
horribly
painful
that
large
drops
of
perspiration
poured
from
his
forehead
at
one
moment
he
would
have
recalled
her
the
next
beggary
stared
him
in
the
face
and
his
diabolical
resolution
was
confirmed
his
agony
of
suspense
became
so
intense
that
he
could
wait
no
longer
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
sick
chamber
and
opening
it
gently
looked
in
the
old
woman
was
sitting
down
on
the
floor
crouched
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
face
and
head
covered
over
with
her
cloak
the
noise
of
the
hinges
startled
her
she
uncovered
her
head
and
looked
up
rainscourt
made
signs
to
her
inquiring
whether
he
had
taken
the
draught
she
shook
her
head
he
pointed
his
finger
angrily
desiring
her
to
give
it
the
old
woman
sank
on
her
knees
and
held
up
her
hands
in
supplication
rainscourt
beckoned
her
out
she
followed
him
to
his
own
room
do
you
see
these
pistols
said
rainscourt
they
are
loaded
immediately
obey
my
orders
promise
me
on
your
soul
that
you
will
or
you
shall
be
the
occasion
of
your
master
death
swear
continued
he
putting
one
of
the
pistols
to
his
ear
and
his
finger
to
the
trigger
i
will
do
it
on
my
soul
i
will
master
dear
cried
norah
only
put
away
the
pistols
and
if
he
were
thousands
more
beautiful
and
if
my
soul
is
to
be
burnt
for
ever
i
do
it
again
she
returned
to
the
chamber
of
the
victim
followed
by
rainscourt
who
stood
at
the
door
to
fortify
her
resolution
seymour
was
awoke
by
the
old
beldame
from
a
dream
in
which
the
form
of
emily
blessed
his
fancy
to
take
the
fatal
draught
now
poured
out
and
presented
to
him
accustomed
to
the
febrifuge
at
certain
hours
he
drank
it
off
in
haste
that
he
might
renew
his
dreaming
happiness
what
is
it
it
burns
my
throat
cried
seymour
it
not
the
like
of
what
you
have
taken
before
said
the
old
woman
shuddering
as
she
offered
him
some
water
to
take
the
taste
away
thank
you
nurse
said
seymour
as
he
again
sank
on
his
pillow
chapter
sixty
you
see
he
is
departing
let
me
come
to
him
give
me
him
as
he
is
if
he
be
turned
to
earth
let
me
but
give
him
one
hearty
kiss
and
you
shall
put
us
both
into
one
coffin
webster
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
after
the
scene
described
in
the
last
chapter
that
emily
awoke
from
her
slumbers
and
chid
the
sun
for
rising
before
her
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
she
descended
to
inquire
after
the
health
of
him
whose
fate
was
now
entwined
with
her
own
she
gently
opened
the
door
of
the
room
the
shutters
were
yet
closed
but
the
sun
poured
his
rays
through
the
chinks
darting
in
spite
of
the
obstruction
a
light
which
rendered
the
useless
the
curtains
of
the
bed
were
closed
and
all
was
quiet
norah
sat
upon
the
floor
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
with
wild
and
haggard
look
and
as
she
passed
the
beads
which
she
was
telling
from
one
finger
to
the
other
her
lips
in
rapid
and
convulsive
motion
but
uttering
no
sound
it
appeared
as
if
she
thought
the
remnant
of
her
life
too
short
for
the
prayers
which
she
had
to
offer
to
the
throne
above
emily
having
in
vain
attempted
to
catch
her
eye
and
fearful
of
waking
seymour
tripped
gently
across
and
pushed
the
nurse
by
the
shoulder
beckoning
her
out
of
the
chamber
norah
followed
her
mistress
into
an
opposite
room
when
emily
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
behaviour
of
the
old
woman
spoke
in
a
low
and
hurried
tone
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
norah
you
look
so
dreadful
is
he
worse
och
hone
said
the
nurse
her
thoughts
evidently
wandering
tell
me
nurse
answer

is
he
worse
i
do
know
replied
norah
the
doctor
will
tell
oh
god
he
worse

sure

cried
emily
bursting
into
tears
what
will
become
of
me
if
my
dear
dear
seymour
dear
seymour
cried
the
startled
norah
yes
my
dear
seymour
i
did
not
tell
you

love

nurse
he
loves
me
we
have
plighted
our
troth
and
if
he
dies

of

continued
the
sobbing
girl
och
hone
and
is
it
the
truth
and
the
real
truth
that

me
and
he
to
be
your
husband

norah
what
did
you
mean
by
he
cried
emily
in
hurried
accents
seizing
the
old
woman
by
the
wrist
with
a
look
of
fearful
anxiety
did
i
say
was
he
i
did
sure
enough
and
it
true
too
i
thought
to
do
my
darling
a
service
and
i
cared
little
for
my
own
soul
so
young
and
so
beautiful
too
and
it
a
nice
pair
ye
would
have
made
and
it
i
that

kilt
him
och
hone
cried
norah
wringing
her
withered
hands
killed
him
norah
what
have
you
done
tell
me
directly
screamed
emily
shaking
the
old
hag
with
all
her
force
quick
the
old
nurse
seemed
to
have
all
the
violence
of
her
mistress
feelings
communicated
to
her
as
she
cried
out
with
a
face
of
horror
it
was
all
for
ye
that
i
did
it
it
the
master
that
made
me
do
it
he
said
my
darling
would
be
a
beggar
it
the
poison
for
the
rats
he
taken
och
och
hone
and
the
old
woman
sank
on
the
floor
covering
up
her
head
while
emily
flew
shrieking
out
of
the
room
when
mcelvina
and
his
party
quitted
the
castle
they
returned
to
mcelvina
house
i
can
not
but
pity
mr
rainscourt
observed
the
vicar
indeed
i
wish
that
notwithstanding
his
violence
we
had
not
quitted
him
without
making
the
communication
so
do
i
replied
mcelvina
but
the
injustice
of
his
accusation
prevented
me
and
i
must
confess
that
i
have
some
pleasure
in
allowing
him
to
remain
hours
in
suspense
longer
than
that
not
even
my
revenge
has
stomach
for
i
am
afraid
observed
debriseau
that
we
have
done
unwisely
the
violence
and
selfishness
of
the
man
character
are
but
too
well
known
and
seymour
is
in
his
power
do
not
be
so
uncharitable
sir
replied
the
vicar
gravely
mr
rainscourt
with
all
his
faults
is
incapable
of
anything
so
base
as
what
you
have
hinted
at
i
trust
i
have
done
him
injustice
replied
debriseau
but
i
saw
that
in
his
eye
during
the
interview
which
chilled
my
blood
when
i
thought
of
your
young
friend
at
all
events
when
i
go
up
morning
to
see
how
seymour
is
i
think
it
will
be
right
to
inform
mr
rainscourt
of
the
facts
i
shall
be
there
by
daylight
will
you
accompany
me
sir
said
mcelvina
to
the
vicar
with
pleasure
replied
the
other
and
from
this
arrangement
the
vicar
and
mcelvina
were
at
the
castle
and
had
sent
their
cards
in
to
mr
rainscourt
at
the
very
time
that
emily
had
beckoned
the
old
nurse
out
of
the
chamber
as
long
as
the
deed
still
remained
to
be
done
the
conflict
between
the
conscience
and
the
evil
intentions
of
rainscourt
had
been
dreadful
but
now
that
it
was
done
now
that
the
rubicon
had
been
passed
to
listen
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
was
useless
and
worn
out
as
it
had
been
in
the
struggle
and
further
soothed
by
the
anticipation
of
continued
prosperity
it
no
longer
had
the
power
to
goad
him
in
short
conscience
for
the
time
had
been
overcome
and
rainscourt
enjoyed
after
the
tempest
a
hallow
and
deceitful
calm
which
he
vainly
hoped
would
be
continued
when
mcelvina
and
the
vicar
were
announced
he
thought
it
prudent
to
receive
them
the
bottle
of
brandy
to
which
he
had
made
frequent
applications
during
the
morning
was
removed
and
having
paid
some
slight
attention
to
his
person
he
requested
that
they
would
walk
up
into
his
when
they
entered
the
violence
of
the
preceding
day
was
no
longer
to
be
perceived
in
his
countenance
which
wore
the
appearance
of
mental
suffering
the
consciousness
of
guilt
was
mistaken
for
humility
and
the
feelings
of
both
mcelvina
and
the
vicar
were
kindly
influenced
towards
rainscourt
mr
rainscourt
said
the
former
we
pay
you
this
early
visit
that
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
relieving
your
mind
from
a
weight
which
it
is
but
too
evident
presses
heavily
upon
it
we
think
when
you
hear
what
we
have
to
impart
you
will
agree
with
us
that
there
will
be
no
occasion
for
litigation
or
mr
seymour
and
your
daughter
have
repeatedly
met
before
this
and
have
long
been
attached
to
each
other
and
although
mr
seymour
was
too
honourable
to
make
your
daughter
an
offer
at
the
time
that
he
was
friendless
and
unknown
yet
the
very
first
moment
after
he
became
acquainted
with
the
change
in
his
circumstances
he
made
a
proposal
and
was
accepted
i
presume
there
can
be
no
objections
to
the
match
and
allow
us
therefore
to
congratulate
you
upon
so
fortunate
a
termination
of
a
very
unpleasant
business
rainscourt
heard
it
all
it
rang
in
his
ears
it
was
torture
horrible
torture
when
they
thought
that
his
eye
would
beam
with
delight
it
turned
glassy
and
fixed
when
they
thought
that
his
features
would
be
illumined
with
smiles
they
were
distorted
with
agony
when
they
thought
that
his
hands
would
be
extended
to
seize
theirs
offered
in
congratulation
they
were
clenched
with
the
rigidity
of
muscle
of
the
drowning
man
the
vicar
and
mcelvina
looked
at
him
and
each
other
in
dismay
but
their
astonishment
was
not
to
last
the
door
burst
open
and
the
frantic
and
shrieking
emily
flew
into
the
room
exclaiming
they
have
murdered
him
oh
god
they
have
poisoned
him
my
father
my
father
how
could
you
do
it
continued
the
girl
as
she
sank
without
animation
on
the
floor
the
vicar
whose
brain
reeled
at
the
dreadful
intelligence
had
scarcely
power
to
move
to
the
assistance
of
emily
while
mcelvina
whose
feelings
of
horror
were
mingled
with
indignation
roughly
seized
rainscourt
by
the
collar
and
detained
him
his
prisoner
i
am
so
calmly
replied
rainscourt
who
stunned
by
the
condition
of
his
daughter
the
futility
and
blindness
of
his
measures
and
the
unexpected
promulgation
of
his
guilt
offered
no
resistance
had
you
made
your
communication
yesterday
sir
this
would
not
have
happened
i
surrender
myself
up
to
justice
you
have
no
objection
to
my
retiring
a
few
minutes
to
my
bedroom
till
the
officers
come
i
have
papers
to
arrange
mcelvina
acceded
and
rainscourt
bowing
low
for
the
attention
went
into
the
adjoining
room
and
closed
the
door
a
few
seconds
had
but
elapsed
when
the
report
of
a
pistol
was
heard
mcelvina
rushed
in
and
found
rainscourt
dead
upon
the
floor
the
gorgeous
tapestry
besprinkled
with
the
blood
and
brains
of
the
murderer
and
the
suicide
one
more
scene
and
all
is
over
draw
up
the
curtain
and
behold
the
chamber
in
which
but
the
evening
before
two
souls
as
pure
as
ever
spurned
the
earth
and
flew
to
heaven
two
forms
perfect
as
ever
nature
moulded
in
her
happiest
mood
two
hearts
that
beat
responsive
without
one
stain
of
self
two
hands
that
plighted
troth
and
vowed
and
meant
to
love
and
cherish
with
all
that
this
world
could
offer
in
possession
health
wealth
power
of
intellect
and
cultivated
minds
joy
and
love
hand
in
hand
smiling
on
the
present
hope
with
her
gilded
wand
pointing
to
futurity
all
vanished
and
in
their
place
standing
like
funeral
mourners
at
each
corner
of
the
bed
misery
despair
agony
and
death
woe
woe
too
great
for
utterance
all
is
as
silent
as
horribly
silent
as
the
grave
yawning
for
its
victim
mcelvina
and
susan
are
supporting
the
sufferer
in
his
last
agonies
and
as
he
writhes
and
his
beseeching
eyes
are
turned
towards
them
supply
the
water
which
but
for
a
moment
damps
the
raging
fire
within
the
surgeon
has
retired
from
his
useless
and
painful
task
habituated
to
death
but
not
to
such
a
scene
as
this
the
vicar
anxious
to
administer
religious
balm
knows
that
in
excruciating
torture
his
endeavours
would
be
vain
and
the
tears
roll
down
his
cheeks
as
he
turns
away
from
a
sight
which
his
kind
heart
will
not
allow
him
to
behold
emily
is
on
her
knees
holding
seymour
hand
which
even
in
his
agony
he
attempts
not
to
remove
her
face
is
lying
down
upon
it
that
she
may
not
behold
his
sufferings
she
speaks
not
moves
not
weeps
not
all
is
calm
deceitful
calm
her
heart
is
broken
and
there
he
lies
the
young
the
beautiful
the
brave
in
one
short
hour
to
be
a
thing
which
the
raven
flaps
her
funeral
wing
