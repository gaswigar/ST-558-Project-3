of

these
mountaineering
notes
are
cordially
inscribed
note
this
book
originally
published
in
has
long
been
out
of
print
though
in
constant
demand
its
publication
was
discontinued
owing
to
the
desire
of
the
author
to
make
certain
emendations
in
the
text
a
work
that
the
arduous
activities
of
a
professional
scientific
life
left
him
no
leisure
to
perform
a
few
changes
indicated
by
him
have
been
made
otherwise
the
text
of
the
present
edition
is
that
of
the
last
the
revised
and
enlarged
edition
of
only
the
fastidiousness
to
which
the
extraordinary
literary
quality
of
the
book
is
itself
due
could
suggest
further
modification
of
what
is
here
republished
with
the
motive
of
restoring
to
print
and
circulation
a
work
too
perfect
in
form
and
of
too
rare
a
quality
to
be
allowed
to
lapse
it
is
accordingly
with
the
view
of
renewing
the
accessibility
of
a
genuine
classic
of
american
literature
that
the
present
edition
is
presented
from
the
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
mountaineers
will
realize
from
these
descriptions
of
sierra
climbs
how
few
dangers
we
encountered
which
might
not
have
been
avoided
by
time
and
caution
since
the
uncertain
perils
of
glacier
work
and
snow
copings
do
not
exist
in
california
except
on
the
northeast
flank
of
mount
shasta
our
climbs
proved
safe
and
easy
in
comparison
with
the
more
serious
alpine
ascents
and
now
that
the
topography
of
the
higher
sierra
has
been
all
explored
by
the
geological
survey
nearly
every
peak
is
found
to
have
an
accessible
side
our
difficulties
and
our
joys
were
those
of
the
pioneer
my
own
share
in
the
great
work
of
exploring
the
sierra
under
professor
whitney
has
been
small
indeed
beside
that
of
the
senior
assistants
of
the
survey
professors
brewer
and
hoffmann
theirs
were
the
long
hard
years
of
patient
labor
theirs
the
real
conquest
of
a
great
terra
incognita
and
if
in
these
chapters
i
have
not
borne
repeated
witness
to
their
skill
and
courage
it
is
not
because
i
have
failed
in
warm
appreciation
but
simply
because
my
own
mountaineering
has
always
been
held
by
me
as
of
slight
value
and
not
likely
to
be
weighed
against
their
service
there
are
in
all
men
s
lives
which
must
give
them
both
pause
and
retrospect
in
long
sierra
journeys
the
mountaineer
looks
forward
eagerly
gladly
till
pass
or
is
gained
and
then
turning
with
a
fonder
interest
surveys
the
scene
of
his
march
letting
the
eye
wander
over
each
crag
and
valley
every
blue
hollow
of
or
sunlit
gem
of
alpine
meadow
discerning
perchance
some
gentle
reminder
of
himself
in
yon
thin
blue
curl
of
smoke
floating
dimly
upward
from
the
smouldering
embers
of
his
last
with
a
lingering
look
he
starts
forward
and
the
closing
with
its
granite
walls
shuts
away
the
retrospect
yet
the
delightful
picture
forever
after
hangs
on
the
gallery
wall
of
his
memory
it
is
thus
with
me
about
mountaineering
the
pass
which
divides
youth
from
manhood
is
traversed
and
the
serious
service
of
science
must
hereafter
claim
me
but
as
the
cherished
memories
of
sierra
climbs
go
ever
with
me
i
may
not
lack
the
inspiring
presence
of
sunlit
snow
nor
the
calming
influence
of
those
broad
noble
views
it
is
the
mountaineer
s
privilege
to
carry
through
life
this
wealth
of
unfading
treasure
at
his
summons
the
white
peaks
loom
above
him
as
of
old
the
burns
once
more
for
him
his
study
walls
recede
in
twilight
revery
and
around
him
are
gathered
again
stately
columns
of
pine
if
the
few
chapters
i
have
gathered
from
these
agreeable
memories
to
make
this
little
book
are
found
to
possess
an
interest
if
along
the
peaks
i
have
sought
to
describe
there
is
reflected
however
faintly
a
ray
of
that
pure
splendid
light

the
people
mountaineering
in
the
sierra
nevada
i
the
range
the
western
margin
of
this
continent
is
built
of
a
succession
of
mountain
chains
folded
in
broad
corrugations
like
waves
of
stone
upon
whose
seaward
base
beat
the
mild
small
breakers
of
the
pacific
by
far
the
grandest
of
all
these
ranges
is
the
sierra
nevada
a
long
and
massive
uplift
lying
between
the
arid
deserts
of
the
great
basin
and
the
californian
exuberance
of
and
orchard
its
eastern
slope
a
defiant
wall
of
rock
plunging
abruptly
down
to
the
plain
the
western
a
long
grand
sweep
well
watered
and
overgrown
with
cool
stately
forests
its
crest
a
line
of
sharp
snowy
peaks
springing
into
the
sky
and
catching
the
long
after
the
sun
has
set
for
all
the
rest
of
america
the
sierras
have
a
structure
and
a
physical
character
which
are
individual
and
unique
to
professor
whitney
and
his
corps
of
the
geological
survey
of
california
is
due
the
honor
of
first
gaining
a
scientific
knowledge
of
the
form
plan
and
physical
conditions
of
the
sierras
how
many
thousands
of
miles
how
many
toilsome
climbs
we
made
and
what
measure
of
patience
came
to
be
expended
can
not
be
told
but
the
general
harvest
is
gathered
in
and
already
a
volume
of
great
interest
the
forerunner
of
others
has
been
published
the
ancient
history
of
the
sierras
goes
back
to
a
period
when
the
atlantic
and
pacific
were
one
ocean
in
whose
depths
great
accumulations
of
sand
and
powdered
stone
were
gathering
and
being
spread
out
in
level
strata
it
is
not
easy
to
assign
the
age
in
which
these
submarine
strata
were
begun
nor
exactly
the
boundaries
of
the
embryo
continents
from
whose
shores
the
primeval
breakers
ground
away
sand
and
gravel
enough
to
form
such
incredibly
thick
deposits
it
appears
most
likely
that
the
sierra
region
was
submerged
from
the
earliest
palæozoic
or
perhaps
even
the
azoic
age
slowly
the
deep
ocean
valley
filled
up
until
in
the
late
triassic
period
the
uppermost
tables
were
in
water
shallow
enough
to
drift
the
sands
and
clays
into
wave
and
ripple
ridges
with
what
immeasurable
patience
what
infinite
deliberation
has
nature
amassed
the
materials
for
these
mountains
age
succeeded
age
form
after
form
of
animal
and
plant
life
perished
in
the
unfolding
of
the
great
plan
of
development
while
the
suspended
sands
of
that
primeval
sea
sank
slowly
down
and
were
stretched
in
level
plains
upon
the
floor
of
stone
early
in
the
jurassic
period
an
impressive
and
movement
of
the
earth
s
crust
took
place
during
which
the
bed
of
the
ocean
rose
in
crumpled
waves
towering
high
in
the
air
and
forming
the
mountain
framework
of
the
western
united
states
this
system
of
upheavals
reached
as
far
east
as
middle
wyoming
and
stretched
from
mexico
probably
into
alaska
its
numerous
ridges
and
chains
having
a
general
northwest
trend
were
crowded
together
in
one
broad
zone
whose
western
and
most
lofty
member
is
the
sierra
nevada
during
all
of
the
cretaceous
period
and
a
part
of
the
tertiary
the
pacific
beat
upon
its
seaward
tearing
to
pieces
the
rocks
crumbling
and
grinding
the
shores
and
drifting
the
powdered
stone
and
pebbles
beneath
its
waves
scattered
them
again
in
layers
this
submarine
fringed
the
whole
base
of
the
range
and
extended
westward
an
unknown
distance
under
the
sea
to
this
perpetual
of
the
sierra
nevada
base
was
added
the
detritus
made
by
the
cutting
out
of
cañons
which
in
great
volumes
continually
poured
into
the
pacific
and
was
arranged
upon
its
bottom
by
currents
in
the
late
tertiary
period
a
chapter
of
very
remarkable
events
occurred
for
a
second
time
the
evenly
laid
beds
of
the
were
crumpled
by
the
shrinking
of
the
earth
the
ocean
flowed
back
into
deeper
and
narrower
limits
and
fronting
the
sierra
nevada
appeared
the
present
system
of
coast
ranges
the
intermediate
depression
or
as
i
like
to
call
it
is
the
valley
of
california
and
is
therefore
a
more
recent
continental
feature
than
the
sierra
nevada
at
once
then
from
the
folded
rocks
of
the
coast
ranges
from
the
sierra
summits
and
the
inland
plateaus
and
from
numberless
vents
caused
by
the
fierce
dynamical
action
there
poured
out
a
general
deluge
of
melted
rock
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
sprang
up
those
fountains
of
lava
whose
cooled
material
forms
many
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
and
all
along
the
coast
of
america
like
a
system
of
answering
beacons
blazed
up
volcanic
chimneys
the
rent
mountains
glowed
with
outpourings
of
molten
stone
sheets
of
lava
poured
down
the
slopes
of
the
sierra
covering
an
immense
proportion
of
its
surface
only
the
high
granite
and
metamorphic
peaks
reaching
above
the
deluge
rivers
and
lakes
floated
up
in
a
cloud
of
steam
and
were
gone
forever
the
misty
sky
of
these
volcanic
days
glowed
with
innumerable
lurid
reflections
and
at
intervals
along
the
crest
of
the
range
great
cones
arose
blackening
the
sky
with
their
plumes
of
mineral
smoke
at
length
having
exhausted
themselves
the
volcanoes
burned
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
by
far
the
greater
number
went
out
altogether
with
a
tendency
to
extremes
which
development
geologists
would
hesitate
to
admit
nature
passed
under
the
dominion
of
ice
and
snow
the
vast
amount
of
ocean
water
which
had
been
vaporized
floated
over
the
land
condensed
upon
chilled
the
lavas
and
finally
buried
beneath
an
icy
covering
all
the
higher
parts
of
the
mountain
system
according
to
laws
the
overburdened
summits
unloaded
themselves
by
a
system
of
glaciers
the
whole
sierra
crest
was
one
pile
of
snow
from
whose
base
crawled
out
the
wearing
their
bodies
into
the
rock
sculpturing
as
they
went
the
forms
of
valleys
and
brightening
the
surface
of
their
tracks
by
the
friction
of
stones
and
sand
which
were
bedded
in
their
nether
surface
having
made
their
way
down
the
slope
of
the
sierra
they
met
a
lowland
temperature
of
sufficient
warmth
to
arrest
and
waste
them
at
last
from
causes
which
are
too
intricate
to
be
discussed
at
present
they
shrank
slowly
back
into
the
higher
summit
fastnesses
and
there
gradually
perished
leaving
only
a
crest
of
snow
the
ice
melted
and
upon
the
whole
plateau
little
by
little
a
thin
layer
of
soil
accumulated
and
replacing
the
snow
there
sprang
up
a
forest
of
pines
whose
shadows
fall
pleasantly
over
rocks
which
were
once
torrents
of
lava
and
across
the
burnished
pathways
of
ice
rivers
pure
and
sparkling
thread
the
bottom
of
these
gigantic
glacier
valleys
the
volcanoes
are
extinct
and
the
whole
theatre
of
this
impressive
geological
drama
is
now
the
most
glorious
and
beautiful
region
of
america
as
the
characters
of
the
passed
safely
through
the
trial
of
fire
and
the
desperate
ordeal
of
water
so
through
the
terror
of
volcanic
fires
and
the
chilling
empire
of
ice
has
the
great
sierra
come
into
the
present
age
of
tranquil
grandeur
five
distinct
periods
divide
the
history
of
the
range
first
the
slow
gathering
of
marine
sediment
within
the
early
ocean
during
which
incalculable
ages
were
consumed
second
in
the
early
jurassic
period
this
level
came
suddenly
to
be
lifted
into
the
air
and
crumpled
in
folds
through
whose
yawning
fissures
and
ruptured
axes
outpoured
wide
zones
of
granite
third
the
volcanic
age
of
fire
and
steam
fourth
the
glacial
period
when
the
sierras
were
one
broad
field
of
snow
with
huge
dragons
of
ice
crawling
down
its
slopes
and
wearing
their
armor
into
the
rocks
fifth
the
present
condition
which
the
following
chapters
will
describe
albeit
in
a
desultory
and
inadequate
manner
from
latitude
to
latitude
the
sierra
lifts
a
continuous
chain
the
profile
culminating
in
several
groups
of
peaks
separated
by
deeply
depressed
curves
or
sharp
notches
the
summits
varying
from
eight
to
fifteen
thousand
feet
seven
to
twelve
thousand
being
the
common
range
of
passes
near
its
southern
extremity
in
san
bernardino
county
the
range
is
cleft
to
the
base
with
magnificent
gateways
opening
through
into
the
desert
from
walker
s
pass
for
two
hundred
miles
northward
the
sky
line
is
more
uniformly
elevated
the
passes
averaging
nine
thousand
feet
high
the
actual
summit
a
chain
of
peaks
from
thirteen
to
fifteen
thousand
feet
this
serrated
snow
and
granite
outline
of
the
sierra
nevada
projected
against
the
cold
clear
blue
is
the
blade
of
white
teeth
which
suggested
its
spanish
name
northward
still
the
range
gradually
sinks
high
peaks
covered
with
perpetual
snow
are
rarer
and
rarer
its
summit
rolls
on
in
broken
ridges
now
and
then
overlooked
by
a
solitary
pile
of
metamorphic
or
irruptive
rock
at
length
in
northern
california
where
it
breaks
down
in
a
compressed
medley
of
ridges
and
open
level
expanses
of
plain
the
axis
is
maintained
by
a
line
of
extinct
volcanoes
standing
above
the
lowland
in
isolated
positions
the
most
lofty
of
these
mount
shasta
is
a
cone
of
lava
fourteen
thousand
four
hundred
and
forty
feet
high
its
broad
base
girdled
with
noble
forests
which
give
way
at
eight
thousand
feet
to
a
cap
of
glaciers
and
snow
beyond
this
to
the
northward
the
extension
of
the
range
is
quite
difficult
to
definitely
assign
for
geologically
speaking
the
sierra
nevada
system
occupies
a
broad
area
in
oregon
consisting
of
several
prominent
mountain
groups
while
in
a
physical
sense
the
chain
ceases
with
shasta
the
cascades
which
are
the
apparent
topographical
continuation
being
a
tertiary
structure
formed
chiefly
of
lavas
which
have
been
outpoured
long
subsequent
to
the
main
upheaval
of
the
sierra
it
is
not
easy
to
point
out
the
actual
southern
limit
either
because
where
the
mountain
mass
descends
into
the
colorado
desert
it
comes
in
contact
with
a
number
of
lesser
groups
of
hills
which
ramify
in
many
directions
all
losing
themselves
beneath
the
tertiary
and
quartenary
beds
of
the
desert
for
four
hundred
miles
the
sierras
are
a
definite
ridge
broad
and
high
and
having
the
form
of
a
buttresses
of
rock
jutting
at
intervals
from
a
steep
wall
form
the
abrupt
eastern
slopes
irregular
forests
in
scattered
growth
huddle
together
near
the
snow
the
lower
declivities
are
barren
spurs
sinking
into
the
sterile
flats
of
the
great
basin
long
ridges
of
comparatively
gentle
outline
characterize
the
western
side
but
this
sloping
table
is
scored
from
summit
to
base
by
a
system
of
parallel
transverse
cañons
distant
from
one
another
often
less
than
miles
they
are
ordinarily
two
or
three
thousand
feet
deep
falling
at
times
in
sheer
cliffs
again
in
sweeping
curves
like
the
hull
of
a
ship
again
in
rugged
gorges
or
with
irregular
hilly
flanks
opening
at
last
through
gateways
of
low
rounded
out
upon
the
horizontal
plain
of
the
san
joaquin
and
sacramento
every
cañon
carries
a
river
derived
from
constant
melting
of
the
perpetual
snow
which
threads
its
way
down
the
mountain
a
feeble
type
of
those
vast
and
torrents
that
formerly
discharged
the
summit
accumulation
of
ice
and
snow
while
carving
the
cañons
out
from
solid
rock
nowhere
on
the
continent
of
america
is
there
more
positive
evidence
of
the
cutting
power
of
rapid
streams
than
in
these
very
cañons
although
much
is
due
to
this
cause
the
most
impressive
passages
of
the
sierra
valleys
are
actual
ruptures
of
the
rock
either
the
engulfment
of
masses
of
great
size
as
professor
whitney
supposes
in
explanation
of
the
peculiar
form
of
the
yosemite
or
a
splitting
asunder
in
yawning
cracks
from
the
summits
down
half
the
distance
to
the
plains
the
cañons
are
also
carved
out

on

of

during

overlays
the

will

vary
constantly
in
strict

with
the
laws
of
altitude
and
moisture
each
of
the
several
species
of

taking
its

with
an
almost
mathematical
precision
where
low
gaps
in

it
advances
toward
the
coast
securing
for
itself
over
this
whole
distance
about
the

that
a
tree
which
finds
itself
at
home
on
the
shore
of
puget
s
sound
in
the
latitude
of

has
climbed
the
sierras
to
a
height
of
six
thousand
feet
finding
there
its
normal
requirements
of
damp
cool
air
as
if
to
economize
the
whole
surface
of
the
sierra
the
forest
is
mainly
made
up
of
twelve
species
of
coniferæ
each
having
its
own
definitely
circumscribed
limits
of
temperature
and
yet
being
able
successively
to
occupy
the
whole
middle
sierra
up
to
the
foot
of
the
perpetual
snow
the
average
range
in
altitude
of
each
species
is
about
hundred
feet
so
that
you
pass
imperceptibly
from
the
zone
of
one
species
into
that
of
the
next
frequently
three
or
four
are
commingled
their
varied

richly
colored
trunks
uniting
to
make
the
most
stately
of
forests
in
the
centre
of
the
coniferous
belt
is
assembled
the
most
remarkable
family
of
trees
those
which
approach
the
perpetual
snow
are
imperfect
gnarled
full
of
character
and
suggestion
but
lacking
the
symmetry
the
rich
living
green
and
the
great
size
of
their
lower
neighbors
in
the
other
extreme
of
the
growing
side
by
side
with
foothill
oaks
is
an
equally
imperfect
species
which
although
attaining
a
very
great
size
still
has
the
air
of
an
abnormal
tree
the
conditions
of
drought
on
the
one
hand
and
rigorous
storms
on
the
other
injure
and
blast
alike
while
the
more
verdant
centre
furnishing
the
finest
conditions
produces
a
forest
whose
profusion
and
grandeur
fill
the
traveller
with
the
liveliest
admiration
toward
the
south
the
growth
of
the
forest
is
more
open
and
the
individual
trees
becoming
proportionally
larger
and
reaching
their
highest
development
northward
its
density
increases
to
the
injury
of
individual
pines
until
the
branches
finally
interlock
and
at
last
on
the
shores
of
british
columbia
the
trunks
are
so
densely
assembled
that
a
dead
tree
is
held
in
its
upright
position
by
the
arms
of
its
fellows
at
the
one
extremity
are
magnificent
purple
shafts
ornamented
with
an
exquisitely
delicate
drapery
of
pale
golden
and
dark
blue
green
at
the
other
the
slender
spars
stand
crowded
together
like
the
fringe
of
masts
girdling
a
prosperous
port
the
one
is
a
great
continuous
grove
on
whose
sunny
openings
are
innumerable
brilliant
parterres
the
other
is
a
dismal
thicket
a
sort
of
gigantic
canebrake
void
of
beauty
dark
impenetrable
save
by
the
avenues
of
streams
where
one
may
float
for
days
between
sombre
walls
of

from
one
to
the
other
of
these
extremes
is
an
imperceptible
transition
only
in
the
passage
of
hundreds
of
miles
does
the
forest
seem
to
thicken
northward
or
the
majesty
of
the
single
trees
appear
to
be
impaired
by
their
struggle
for
room

the
glorious

dwarfed
toward

a

effect
the
inexorable
sway
which
climatic
conditions
hold
over
the
kingdom
of

down

the

a
closely
woven
vesture

has
fallen
over
the

closely

quite
without

a
certain
impressive
breadth
when
seen
from
some
overlooking
eminence
or
when
in

its
brilliant
carpet

lies
as

of

a
strip
of

lies
under
the
east
slope
of
the
great

and
stretches
eastward
sometimes
as
far
as
five
hundred
miles
varied
by
successions
of
bare
white
ground
effervescing
under
the
hot
sun
with
alkaline
salts
plains
covered
by
the
low
high
barren
rocky
ranges
which
are
folds
of
metamorphic
rocks
and
lavas
of
bright
red
or
yellow
colors
all
by
a
sky
which
is
at
one
time
of
a
hot
metallic
brilliancy
and
again
the
tenderest
of
evanescent
purple
or
pearl
utterly
opposed
are
the
two
aspects
of
the
sierras
from
these
east
and
west
approaches
i
remember
how
stern
and
strong
the
chain
looked
to
me
when
i
first
saw
it
from
the
colorado
desert
it
was
in
early
may
my
companion
james
terry
gardiner
and
i
got
into
the
saddle
on
the
bank
of
the
colorado
river
and
headed
westward
over
the
road
from
la
paz
to
san
bernardino
my
mount
was
a
tough
magnanimous
sort
of
mule
who
at
all
times
did
his
very
best
that
of
my
friend
an
animal
still
hardier
but
altogether
wanting
in
moral
attributes
he
developed
a
singular
antipathy
for
my
mule
and
utterly
refused
to
march
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
me
so
that
over
a
wearying
route
of
three
hundred
miles
we
were
obliged
to
travel
just
beyond
the
reach
of
a
shout
hour
after
hour
plodding
along
at
a
we
pursued
our
solitary
way
without
the
spice
of
companionship
and
altogether
deprived
of
the
melodramatic
satisfaction
of
loneliness
far
ahead
of
us
a
white
line
traced
across
the
barren
plain
marked
our
road
it
seemed
to
lead
to
nowhere
except
onward
over
more
and
more
arid
reaches
of
desert
rolling
hills
of
crude
color
and
low
gloomy
contour
rose
above
the
general
level
here
and
there
the
eye
was
arrested
by
a
towering
crag
or
an
elevated
rocky
mountain
group
whose
naked
sides
sank
down
into
the
desert
unrelieved
by
the
shade
of
a
solitary
tree
the
whole
aspect
of
nature
was
dull
in
color
and
gloomy
with
an
silence
of
death
although
the
summer
had
not
fairly
opened
a
torrid
sun
beat
down
with
cruel
severity
blinding
the
eye
with
its
brilliance
and
inducing
a
painful
slow
fever
the
very
plants
scorched
to
a
crisp
were
ready
at
the
first
blast
of
a
sirocco
to
be
whirled
away
and
ground
to
dust
certain
bare
zones
lay
swept
clean
of
the
last
dry
stems
across
our
path
marking
the
track
of
whirlwinds
water
was
only
found
at
intervals
of
sixty
or
seventy
miles
and
when
reached
was
more
of
an
aggravation
than
a
pleasure
bitter
turbid
and
scarce
we
rode
for
it
all
day
and
berated
it
all
night
only
to
leave
it
at
sunrise
with
a
secret
fear
that
we
might
fare
worse
next
time
about
noon
on
the
third
day
of
our
march
having
reached
the
borders
of
the
chabazon
valley
we
emerged
from
a
rough
rocky
gateway
in
the
mountains
and
i
paused
while
my
companion
made
up
his
quarter
of
a
mile
that
we
might
hold
council
and
determine
our
course
for
the
water
question
was
becoming
serious
springs
which
looked
cool
and
seductive
on
our
maps
proving
to
be
dried
up
and
obsolete
upon
the
ground
a
fresh
mule
and
a
lively
man
get
along
to
be
sure
well
enough
but
after
all
it
is
at
best
with
perfunctory
tolerance
on
both
sides
a
sort
of
diplomatic
interchange
of
argument
the
man
suggesting
with
bridle
or
mildly
admonishing
with
spurs
but
when
the
high
contracting
parties
get
tired
the
goes
to
pieces
and
actual
hostilities
open
in
which
i
never
knew
a
man
to
come
out
the
better
i
had
noticed
a
shambling
uncertainty
during
the
last
s
trot
and
those
invariable
indicators
john
s
long
furry
ears
either
lopped
diagonally
down
on
one
side
or
lay
back
with
ill
omen
upon
his
neck
gardiner
reached
me
in
a
few
minutes
and
we
dismounted
to
rest
the
tired
mules
and
to
scan
the
landscape
before
us
we
were
on
the
margin
of
a
great
basin
whose
gently
shelving
rim
sank
from
our
feet
to
a
perfectly
level
plain
which
stretched
southward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
bounded
by
a
dim
level
horizon
like
the
sea
but
walled
in
to
the
west
at
a
distance
of
about
forty
miles
by
the
high
frowning
wall
of
the
sierras
this
plain
was
a
level
floor
as
white
as
marble
and
into
it
the
rocky
spurs
from
our
own
mountain
range
descended
like
promontories
into
the
sea
wide
deeply
indented
white
bays
wound
in
and
out
among
the
and
traced
upon
the
barren
slopes
of
this
rocky
coast
was
marked
at
a
considerable
elevation
above
the
plain
the
of
an
ancient
sea
a
white
stain
defining
its
former
margin
as
clearly
as
if
the
water
had
but
just
receded
on
the
dim
distant
base
of
the
sierras
the
same
primeval
beach
could
be
seen
this
the
level
white
valley
and
the
utter
absence
upon
its
surface
of
any
vegetation
gave
a
strange
and
weird
aspect
to
the
country
as
if
a
vast
tide
had
but
just
ebbed
and
the
brilliant
scorching
sun
had
hurriedly
dried
up
its
last
traces
of
moisture
in
the
indistinct
glare
of
the
southern
horizon
it
needed
but
slight
aid
from
the
imagination
to
see
a
lifting
and
tumbling
of
billows
as
if
the
old
tide
were
coming
but
they
were
only
shudderings
of
heat
as
we
sat
there
surveying
this
unusual
scene
the
white
expanse
became
suddenly
transformed
into
a
placid
blue
sea
along
whose
rippling
shores
were
the
white
blocks
of
roofs
groups
of
villages
and
cool
stretches
of
green
grove
a
soft
vapory
atmosphere
hung
over
this
sea
shadows
purple
and
blue
floated
slowly
across
it
producing
the
most
enchanting
effect
of
light
and
color
the
dreamy
richness
of
the
tropics
the
serene
sapphire
sky
of
the
desert
and
the
cool
purple
distance
of
mountains
were
grouped
as
by
miracle
it
was
as
if
nature
were
about
to
repay
us
an
for
the
lie
she
had
given
the
topographers
and
their
maps
in
a
moment
the
illusion
vanished
it
was
gone
leaving
the
white
desert
unrelieved
by
a
shadow
a
blaze
of
white
light
falling
full
on
the
plain
the
air
reeling
in
whirlwind
columns
white
with
the
dust
of
the
desert
up
up
and
vanishing
into
the
sky
waves
of
heat
rolled
like
billows
across
the
valley
the
old
shores
became
indistinct
the
whole
lowland
unreal
shades
of
misty
blue
crossed
over
it
and
disappeared
lakes
with
ragged
shores
gleamed
out
reflecting
the
sky
and
in
a
moment
disappeared
the
bewildering
effect
of
this
natural
magic
and
perhaps
the
feverish
thirst
produced
the
impression
of
a
dream
which
might
have
taken
fatal
possession
of
us
but
for
the
importunate
braying
of
gardiner
s
mule
whose
piteous
discords
for
he
made
three
noises
at
once
banished
all
hallucination
and
brought
us
gently
back
from
the
mysterious
spectacle
to
the
practical
question
of
water
we
had
but
one
canteen
of
that
precious
elixir
left
the
elixir
in
this
case
being
composed
of
one
part
pure
water
one
part
sand
one
part
alum
one
part
saleratus
with
liberal
traces
of
colorado
mud
representing
a
very
disgusting
taste
and
very
great
range
of
geological
formations
to
search
for
the
mountain
springs
laid
down
upon
our
maps
was
probably
to
find
them
dry
and
afforded
us
little
more
inducement
than
to
chase
the
mirages
the
only
water
was
at
an
oasis
somewhere
on
the
margin
of
the
chabazon
and
should
if
the
information
was
correct
have
been
in
sight
from
our
we
eagerly
scanned
the
distance
but
were
unable
among
the
phantom
lakes
and
the
illusions
of
the
desert
to
fix
upon
any
probable
point
indian
trails
led
out
in
all
directions
and
our
only
clew
to
the
right
path
was
far
in
the
northwest
where
looming
against
the
sky
stood
two
conspicuous
mountain
piles
lifted
above
the
general
wall
of
the
sierra
their
bases
rooted
in
the
desert
and
their
precipitous
fronts
rising
boldly
on
each
side
of
an
open
gateway
the
two
summits
high
above
the
magical
stratum
of
desert
air
were
sharply
defined
and
singularly
distinct
in
all
the
details
of
and
from
their
position
we
knew
them
to
be
walls
of
the
san
gorgonio
pass
and
through
this
gateway
lay
our
road
after
brief
deliberation
we
chose
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
beaten
road
leading
in
that
direction
and
i
mounted
my
mule
and
started
leaving
my
friend
patiently
seated
in
his
saddle
waiting
for
the
of
his
mule
to
take
effect
thus
we
rode
down
into
the
desert
and
hour
after
hour
travelled
silently
on
straining
our
eyes
forward
to
a
spot
of
green
which
we
hoped
might
mark
our
oasis
so
incredulous
had
i
become
that
i
prided
myself
upon
having
penetrated
the
flimsy
disguise
of
an
unusually
deceptive
mirage
and
philosophized
to
a
considerable
extent
upon
the
superiority
of
my
reason
over
the
instinct
of
the
mule
whose
quickened
pace
and
nervous
manner
showed
him
to
be
as
i
thought
a
dupe
whenever
there
comes
to
be
a
clearly
defined
mental
issue
between
man
and
mule
the
stubbornness
of
the
latter
is
the
expression
of
an
adamantine
moral
resolve
founded
in
eternal
right
the
man
is
invariably
wrong
thus
on
this
occasion
as
at
a
thousand
other
times
i
was
obliged
to
own
up
worsted
and
i
drummed
for
a
while
with
spanish
spurs
upon
the
ribs
of
my
conqueror
that
being
my
habitual
mode
of
covering
my
retreat
it
the
oasis
and
not
the
mirage
john
lifted
up
his
voice
now
many
days
hushed
and
gave
out
spasmodic
gusts
of
barytone
which
were
as
dry
and
harsh
as
if
he
had
drunk
mirages
only
the
heart
of
gardiner
s
mule
relented
of
his
own
accord
he
galloped
up
to
my
side
and
for
the
first
time
together
we
rode
forward
to
the
margin
of
the
oasis
under
the
palms
we
hastily
threw
off
our
saddles
and
allowed
the
parched
brutes
to
drink
their
fill
we
lay
down
in
the
grass
drank
bathed
our
faces
and
played
in
the
water
like
children
we
picketed
our
mules
in
the
freshest
of
grass
and
unpacking
our
sent
up
a
smoke
to
heaven
and
achieved
that
most
precious
solace
of
the
desert
traveller
a
pot
of
tea
by
and
by
we
plunged
into
the
pool
which
was
perhaps
thirty
feet
long
and
deep
enough
to
give
us
a
pleasant
swim
the
water
being
almost
we
absorbed
it
in
every
pore
dilated
like
sponges
and
came
out
refreshed
it
is
well
worth
having
one
s
juices
broiled
out
by
a
desert
sun
just
to
experience
the
renewal
of
life
from
a
mild
parboil
that
about
s
man
with
the
broken
ear
under
this
same
aqueous
renovation
was
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
his
granddaughter
no
longer
appears
to
me
odd
our
oasis
spread
out
its
disc
of
delicate
green
sharply
defined
upon
the
desert
which
stretched
away
for
leagues
simple
unbroken
pathetic
near
the
eastern
edge
of
this
garden
whose
whole
surface
covered
hardly
more
than
an
acre
rose
two
palms
interlocking
their
cool
dark
foliage
over
the
pool
of
pure
water
a
low
deserted
cabin
with
wide
overhanging
flat
roof
which
had
long
ago
been
thatched
with
stood
close
by
the
trees
with
its
isolation
its
strange
warm
fountain
its
charming
vegetation
varied
with
grasses
trailing
bright
parterres
in
which
were
minute
flowers
of
turquoise
blue
pale
gold
mauve
and
rose
and
its
two
graceful
palms
this
oasis
evoked
a
strange
sentiment
i
have
never
felt
such
a
sense
of
absolute
and
remote
seclusion
the
hot
trackless
plain
and
distant
groups
of
mountain
shut
it
away
from
all
the
world
its
humid
and
fragrant
air
hung
over
us
in
delicious
contrast
with
the
through
which
we
had
ridden
weary
little
birds
alighted
panting
and
drank
and
drank
again
without
showing
the
least
fear
of
us
wild
doves
fluttering
down
bathed
in
the
pool
and
fed
about
among
our
mules
after
straining
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
silent
desert
hearing
no
sound
but
the
shoes
of
our
mules
grating
upon
hot
sand
after
the
white
glare
and
that
which
comes
from
drinking
it
was
a
deep
pleasure
to
lie
under
the
palms
and
look
up
at
their
green
fans
and
hear
in
those
shaded
recesses
the
mild
sweet
twittering
of
our
the
birds
who
stayed
like
ourselves
overcome
with
the
languor
of
perfect
repose
declining
rapidly
toward
the
west
the
sun
warned
us
to
renew
our
journey
several
hours
rest
and
frequent
deep
draughts
of
water
added
to
the
feast
of
succulent
grass
filled
out
and
rejuvenated
our
john
was
far
less
an
anatomical
specimen
than
when
i
unsaddled
him
and
gardiner
s
mule
came
up
to
be
bridled
with
so
mollified
a
demeanor
that
it
occurred
to
us
as
just
possible
he
might
forget
his
trick
of
lagging
behind
but
with
the
old
tenacity
of
purpose
he
planted
his
forefeet
and
waited
till
i
was
well
out
on
the
desert
as
i
rode
i
watched
the
western
prospect
completely
bounding
the
basin
in
that
direction
rose
the
gigantic
wall
of
the
sierra
its
serrated
line
sharply
profiled
against
the
evening
sky
this
dark
barrier
became
more
and
more
shadowed
so
that
the
old
shore
line
and
the
lowland
where
mountain
and
plain
joined
were
lost
the
desert
melted
in
the
distance
into
the
shadowed
masses
of
the
sierra
which
looming
higher
and
higher
seemed
to
rise
as
the
sun
went
down
scattered
shone
along
its
crest
each
peak
and
notch
every
column
of
rock
and
detail
of
outline
were
black
and
sharp
on
either
side
of
the
san
gorgonio
stood
its
two
guardian
peaks
san
bernardino
and
san
jacinto
capped
with
rosy
snow
and
the
pass
itself
warm
with
western
light
opened
hopefully
before
us
for
a
moment
the
sun
rested
upon
the
sierra
crest
and
then
slowly
sinking
suffered
eclipse
by
its
ragged
black
profile
through
the
slow
hours
of
darkening
twilight
a
strange
ashy
gloom
overspread
the
desert
the
forms
of
the
distant
mountain
chains
behind
us
and
the
old
shore
line
upon
the
sierra
base
stared
at
us
with
a
strange
weird
distinctness
at
last
all
was
gray
and
vague
except
the
black
silhouette
of
the
sierras
cut
upon
a
band
of
golden
heaven
we
at
length
reached
their
foot
and
turning
northward
rode
parallel
with
the
base
toward
the
san
gorgonio
in
the
moonless
night
huge
rocky
buttresses
of
the
range
loomed
before
us
their
feet
plunging
into
the
pale
desert
floor
high
upon
their
fronts
perhaps
five
hundred
feet
above
us
was
dimly
traceable
the
white
line
of
ancient
shore
over
drifted
hills
of
sand
and
hard
alkaline
clay
we
rode
along
the
bottom
of
that
primitive
sea
between
the
spurs
deep
mountain
alcoves
stretching
back
into
the
heart
of
the
range
opened
grand
and
shadowy
far
at
their
head
over
crests
of
ridge
and
peak
loomed
the
planet
jupiter
a
long
wearisome
ride
of
forty
hours
brought
us
to
the
open
san
gorgonio
pass
already
scattered
beds
of
flowers
tinted
the
austere
face
of
the
desert
tufts
of
pale
grass
grew
about
the
stones
and
tall
stems
of
yucca
bore
up
their
magnificent
bunches
of
bluish
flowers
upon
all
the
heights
overhanging
the
road
gnarled
struggling
cedars
grasp
the
rock
and
stretch
themselves
with
frantic
effort
to
catch
a
breath
of
the
fresh
pacific
vapor
it
is
instructive
to
observe
the
difference
between
those
which
lean
out
into
the
vitalizing
wind
of
the
pass
and
the
fated
few
whose
position
exposes
them
to
the
dry
air
of
the
desert
vigor
soundness
nerve
to
stand
on
the
edge
of
sheer
walls

of
green

in
the
one
a

of
dull
scantily
cover
the
thin
straggling
boughs
of
the
others
they
are
rigid
shrunken
split
to
the
heart
pitiful
we
were
glad
to
forget
them
as
we
turned
a
last
buttress
and
ascended
the
gentle
acclivity
of
the
pass
before
us
opened
a
broad
gateway
six
or
seven
miles
from
wall
to
wall
in
which
a
mere
swell
of
green
land
rises
to
divide
the
desert
and
pacific
slopes
flanking
the
pass
along
its
northern
side
stands

bernardino

granite
framework
crowded
up
above
the
beds

through

of

to
the
height
of
ten

the
opposite

a
dark
crag
of

flanks
are

and
waterworn
into

catching
a
share
of
the
drainage
from

with
a
hundred
small
waterfalls
numerous
brooks

to

two
rivers

running
down
the

slope
among
ranches

into
the

the

pouring
eastward
shrinking
as
it
flows
out
upon
the
hot
sands

in
a

miles
the
unslakable
desert

drunk
it
dry
there
are
but
few
points
in
america
where
such
extremes
of
physical
condition
meet
what
contrasts
what
opposed
sentiments
the
two
views
awakened
spread
out
below
us
lay
the
desert
stark
and
glaring
its
rigid
lying
in
disordered
grouping
in
attitudes
of
the
dead
the
bare
hills
are
cut
out
with
sharp
gorges
and
over
their
stone
skeletons
scanty
earth
clings
in
folds
like
shrunken
flesh
they
are
emaciated
corses
of
once
noble
ranges
now
lifeless
outstretched
as
in
a
long
sleep
ghastly
colors
define
them
from
the
ashen
plain
in
which
their
feet
are
buried
far
in
the
south
were
a
procession
of
whirlwind
columns
slowly
moving
across
the
desert
in
spectral
dimness
a
white
light
beat
down
dispelling
the
last
trace
of
shadow
and
above
hung
the
burnished
shield
of
hard
pitiless
sky
sinking
to
the
from
our
feet
the
gentle
sloped
away
flanked
by
rolling
hills
covered
with
a
fresh
vernal
carpet
of
grass
and
relieved
by
scattered
groves
of
dark
upon
the
distant
valley

checkered
fields
of
grass
and
grain
just
tinged
with
the

ripening
yellow
the
bounding

in
the
cool
shadow
of
a
bank
of
mist
which
drifted
in
from
the
pacific
covering
their
heights
flocks
of
bright
clouds
floated
across
the
sky
whose
blue
was
palpitating
with
light
and
seemed
to
rise
with
infinite
perspective
tranquillity
abundance
the
slow
beautiful
unfolding
of
plant
life
dark
shadowed
spots
to
rest
our
tired
eyes
upon
the
shade
of
giant
oaks
to
lie
down
under
while
listening
to
brooks
contralto
larks
and
the
soft
distant
lowing
of
cattle
i
have
given
the
outlines
of
aspect
along
our
ride
across
the
chabazon
omitting
many
amusing
incidents
and
some
pictures
of
rare
interest
among
the
kaweah
indians
as
i
wished
simply
to
illustrate
the
relations
of
the
sierra
with
the
country
bordering
its
east
base
the
barrier
looming
above
a
desert
in
nevada
and
california
farther
north
this
wall
rises
more
grandly
but
its
face
rests
upon
a
modified
form
of
desert
plains
of
less
extent
than
the
colorado
and
usually
covered
with
and
other
brushy
of
equally
pitiful
appearance
large
lakes
of
complicated
saline
waters
are
dotted
under
the
sierra
shadow
the
ancient
terraces
built
upon
and
outlying
volcanic
ranges
indicating
their
former
expansion
into
inland

and
farther
north
still
where
plains
extend
east
of

form
the

and
open
black
rocky
channels
for
the
numerous
branches
of
the
sacramento
and

approaching
the
sierras
anywhere
from
the
west
one
will
perceive
a
totally
different
topographical
and
climatic
condition
from
the
coast
range
peaks
especially
one
obtains
an
extended
and
impressive
prospect
i
had
fallen
behind
the
party
one
may
evening
of
our
march
across
pacheco
s
pass
partly
because
some
oaks
trailing
almost
horizontally
over
the
surface
of
the
hills
and
marking
as
a
living
record
the
prevalent
west
wind
had
arrested
me
and
called
out
compass
and
and
because
there
had
fallen
to
my
lot
an
incorrigibly
deliberate
mustang
to
whom
i
had
abandoned
myself
to
be
carried
along
at
his
own
pace
comforted
withal
that
i
should
get
in
too
late
to
have
any
hand
in
the
cooking
of
supper
we
reached
the
crest
the
mustang
coming
to
a
conspicuous
and
unwarrantable
halt
i
yielded
however
and
sat
still
in
the
saddle
looking
out
to
the
east
brown
purple
over
their
lower
slopes
with
blossoms
descended
steeply
to
the
plain
of
california
a
great
inland
prairie
sea
extending
for
five
hundred
miles
between
the
sierras
and
coast
hills
and
now
a
broad
arabesque
surface
of
colors
miles
of
flowers
cloudings
of
green
and
white
reaches
of
violet
which
looked
like
the
shadow
of
a
passing
cloud
wandering
in
natural
patterns
over
and
through
each
other
sunny
and
intense
along
near
our
range
fading
in
the
distance
into
pale
tones
and
divided
by
long
dimly
seen
rivers
whose
margins
were
edged
by
belts
of
bright
emerald
green
beyond

three
hundred
miles
of

half
lost
in
light
and
cloud
and
mist
the
summit
in
places
sharply
seen
against
a
pale
beryl
sky
and
again
buried
in
warm
rolling
clouds
it
was
a
mass
of
strong
light
soft
fathomless
shadows
and
dark
regions
of
forest
however
the
three
belts
upon
its
front
were
tolerably
clear
dusky
rose
over
the
plain
with
a
coppery
gold
tone
suggesting
the
line
of
mining
towns
planted
in
its
rusty
ravines
a
suggestion
i
was
glad
to
repel
and
look
higher
into
that
cool
solemn
realm
where
the
pines
stand
in
infinite
colonnade
lifted
above
the
bustling
industry
of
the
plains
and
the
melodramatic
mining
theatre
of
the
it
has
a
grand
silent
life
of
its
own
refreshing
to
contemplate
even
from
a
hundred
miles
away

many
miles
south

by
what
he
called
dealing
bottom
stock
in
his
little
evening
games
with
the
honest
miners
not
ungrateful
for
that
i
however
detested
the
fellow
with
great
cordiality
if
i
don
t
take
him
will
you
be
responsible
for
packing
mules
and
for
daily
bread
said
brewer
to
me
the
morning
of
our
departure
from
oakland
i
then
we
ll
take
your
man
cotter
only
when
the
roll
under
the
mules
bellies
i
shall
light
my
pipe
and
go
botanizing
so
my
friend
richard
cotter
came
into
the
service
and
the
accomplished
but
filthy
jan
opened
a
poker
and
rum
shop
on
one
of
the
san
francisco
wharves
where
he
still
mixes
drinks
and
puts
up
jobs
of
bottom
secretly
i
longed
for
him
as
we
came
down
the
pacheco
pass
the
packs
having
loosened
with
provoking
frequency
the
animals
of
our
small
exploring
party
were
upon
a
footing
of
easy
social
equality
with
us
all
were
excellent
except
mine
the
choice
of
hobson
whom
i
take
to
have
been
the
youngest
member
of
some
company
falling
naturally
to
me
i
came
to
be
possessed
of
the
only
hopeless
animal
in
the
band
old
slum
a
dignified
roan
mustang
of
a
certain
age
with
the
decorum
of
years
and
a
conspicuous
economy
of
force
retained
not
a
few
of
the
affectations
of
youth
such
as
snorting
theatrically
and
shying
though
with
absolute
safety
to
the
rider
professor
brewer
hoffman
s
mount
was
a
young
full
of
fire
and
gentleness
the
mare
bess
my
friend
gardiner
s
pet
was
a
creature
as
full
of
spring
and
perception
as
her
sex
and
species
may
be
a
rare
mule
cate
carried
cotter
nell
and
jim
two
old
geological
mules
branded
with
mexican
hieroglyphics
from
head
to
tail
were
bearers
of
the
loads
my
buckskin
was
incorrigibly
bad
to
begin
with
his
anatomy
was
desultory
and
incoherent
the
maximum
of
physical
effort
bringing
about
a
slow
shambling
gait
quite
unendurable
he
was
further
cursed
with
a
brain
wanting
the
elements
of
logic
as
evinced
by
such
as
shying
insanely
at
wisps
of
hay
and
stampeding
beyond
control
when
i
tried
to
tie
him
to
a
load
of
grain
my
sole
amusement
with
buckskin
grew
out
of
a
psychological
peculiarity
of
his
namely
the
unusual
slowness
with
which
waves
of
sensation
were
propelled
inward
toward
the
brain
from
remote
parts
of
his
periphery
a
dig
of
the
spurs
administered
in
the
flank
passed
unnoticed
for
a
period
of
time
varying
from
twelve
to
thirteen
seconds
till
the
protoplasm
of
the
brain
received
the
percussive
wave
then
with
a
suddenness
which
i
never
wholly
got
over
he
would
dash
into
a
trot
nearly
tripping
himself
up
with
his
own
astonishment
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
completed
our
outfit
and
my
happiness
by
bringing
to
visalia
a
spaniard
who
was
under
some
manner
of
financial
cloud
his
horse
was
offered
for
sale
and
quickly
bought
for
me
by
professor
brewer
we
named
him
kaweah
after
the
river
and
its
indian
tribe
he
was
young
strong
fleet
elegant
a
pattern
of
fine
modelling
in
every
part
of
his
bay
body
and
fine
black
legs
every
way
good
only
fearfully
wild
with
a
blaze
of
quick
electric
light
in
his
dark
eye
shortly
after
sunrise
one
fresh
morning
we
made
a
point
of
putting
the
packs
on
very
securely
and
getting
into
our
saddles
rode
out
toward
the
sierras
the
group
of
farms
surrounding
visalia
is
gathered
within
a
belt
through
which
several
natural
and
many
more
artificial
channels
of
the
kaweah
flow
groves
of
large
oaks
follow
this
irrigated
zone
the
roads
nearly
always
in
shadow
are
flanked
by
small
fenced
in
with
rank
jungles
of
weeds
and
rows
of
decrepit
pickets
there
is
about
these
fresh
ruins
these
specimens
of
modern
decay
an
air
of
social
decomposition
not
pleasant
to
perceive
freshly
built
houses
still
untinted
by
time
left
in
rickety
disorder
windows
gates
broken
down
or
unhinged
and
a
kind
of
sullen
neglect
staring
everywhere
what
more
can
i
say
of
the
people
than
that
they
are
chiefly
immigrants
who
subsist
upon
pork
rare
exceptions
of
comfort
and
thrift
shine
out
sometimes
with
neat
dooryards
dwellings
and
children
in
these
i
never
saw
the
mother
of
the
family
sitting
smoking
a
corncob
pipe
nor
the
father
loafing
about
with
a
fiddle
or
our
backs
were
now
turned
to
this
the
road
leading
us
out
upon
the
open
plain
in
our
first
full
sight
of
the
sierras
grand
and
cool
swelled
up
the
forest
sharp
and
rugged
rose
the
wave
of
white
peaks
their
vast
fields
of
snow
rolling
over
the
summit
in
broad
shining
masses
sunshine
exuberant
vegetation
brilliant
plant
life
occupied
our
attention
hour
after
hour
until
the
middle
of
the
second
day
at
last
after
climbing
a
long
weary
ascent
we
rode
out
of
the
dazzling
light
of
the
into
a
region
of
dense
woodland
the
road
winding
through
avenues
of
pines
so
tall
that
the
late
evening
light
only
came
down
to
us
in
scattered
rays
under
the
deep
shade
of
these
trees
we
found
an
air
pure
and
gratefully
cool
passing
from
the
glare
of
the
open
country
into
the
dusky
forest
one
seems
to
enter
a
door
and
ride
into
a
vast
covered
hall
the
whole
sensation
is
of
being
roofed
and
enclosed
you
are
never
tired
of
gazing
down
long
vistas
where
in
stately
groups
stand
tall
shafts
of
pine
columns
they
are
each
with
its
own
characteristic
tinting
and
finish
yet
all
standing
together
with
the
air
of
relationship
and
harmony
feathery
branches
trimmed
with
living
green
wave
through
the
upper
air
opening
broken
glimpses
of
the
far
blue
and
catching
on
their
polished
surfaces
reflections
of
the
sun
broad
streams
of
light
pour
in
gilding
purple
trunks
and
falling
in
bright
pathways
along
an
undulating
floor
here
and
there
are
wide
open
spaces
around
which
the
trees
group
themselves
in
majestic
ranks
our
eyes
often
ranged
upward
the
long
shafts
leading
the
vision
up
to
green
lighted
spires
and
on
to
the
clouds
all
that
is
dark
and
cool
and
grave
in
color
the
beauty
of
blue
umbrageous
distance
all
the
sudden
brilliance
of
strong
local
lights
tinted
upon
green
boughs
or
red
and
fluted
shafts
surround
us
in
combination
as
we
ride
along
these
winding
roadways
of
the
sierra
we
had
marched
a
few
hours
over
high
rolling
wooded
ridges
when
in
the
late
afternoon
we
reached
the
brow
of
an
eminence
and
began
to
descend
looking
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
beneath
us
we
saw
a
mountain
basin
fifteen
hundred
feet
deep
surrounded
by
a
rim
of
hills
an
even
unbroken
wood
covered
these
sweeping
slopes
down
to
the
very
bottom
and
in
the
midst
open
to
the
sun
lay
a
circular
green
meadow
about
a
mile
in
diameter
as
we
descended
side
marked
by
the
deep
ruts
of
timber
wagons
joined
our
road
on
either
side
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
we
reached
the
basin
and
saw
the
distant
roofs
of
thomas
s
ranch
we
crossed
the
level
disc
of
meadow
fording
a
clear
cold
mountain
stream
flowing
as
the
best
brooks
do
over
clean
white
granite
sand
and
near
the
northern
margin
of
the
valley
upon
a
slight
eminence
in
the
edge
of
a
magnificent
forest
pitched
our
camp
the
hills
to
the
westward
already
cast
down
a
sombre
shadow
which
fell
over
the
eastern
hills
and
across
the
meadow
dividing
the
basin
half
in
golden
and
half
in
azure
green
the
tall
young
grass
was
living
with
purple
and
white
flowers
this
exquisite
carpet
sweeps
up
over
the
bases
of
the
hills
in
green
undulations
and
strays
far
into
the
forest
in
irregular
fields
a
little
brooklet
passed
close
by
our
camp
and
flowed
down
the
smooth
green
which
led
from
our
little
eminence
to
the
meadow
above
us
towered
pines
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
their
straight
fluted
trunks
smooth
and
without
a
branch
for
a
hundred
feet
above
that
and
on
to
the
very
tops
the
green
branches
stretched
out
and
interwove
until
they
spread
a
broad
leafy
canopy
from
column
to
column
professor
brewer
determined
to
make
this
camp
a
home
for
the
week
during
which
we
were
to
explore
and
study
all
about
the
neighborhood
we
were
on
a
great
granite
spur
sixty
miles
from
east
to
west
by
twenty
miles
wide
which
lies
between
the
kaweah
and
king
s
river
cañons
rising
in
bold
sweeps
from
the
plain
this
ridge
joins
the
sierra
summit
in
the
midst
of
a
high
group
experience
had
taught
us
that
the
cañons
are
impassable
by
animals
for
any
great
distance
so
the
plan
of
campaign
was
to
find
a
way
up
over
the
rocky
crest
of
the
spur
as
far
as
mules
could
go
in
the
little
excursions
from
this
camp
which
were
made
usually
on
horseback
we
became
acquainted
with
the
forest
and
got
a
good
knowledge
of
the
topography
of
a
considerable
region
on
the
heights
above
king
s
cañon
are
some
singularly
fine
assemblies
of
trees
cotter
and
i
had
ridden
all
one
morning
northeast
from
camp
under
the
shadowy
roof
of
forest
catching
but
occasional
glimpses
out
over
the
plateau
until
at
last
we
emerged
upon
the
bare
surface
of
a
ridge
of
granite
and
came
to
the
brink
of
a
sharp
precipice
rocky
crags
lifted
just
east
of
us
the
hour
devoted
to
climbing
them
proved
well
spent
a
single
little
family
of
alpine
firs
growing
in
a
niche
in
the
granite
surface
and
partly
sheltered
by
a
rock
made
the
only
shadow
and
just
shielded
us
from
the
intense
light
as
we
lay
down
by
their
roots
north
and
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
heaved
the
broad
green
waves
of
plateau
swelling
and
merging
through
endless
modulation
of
slope
and
form
conspicuous
upon
the
horizon
about
due
east
of
us
was
a
tall
pyramidal
mass
of
granite
trimmed
with
buttresses
which
radiated
down
from
its
crest
each
one
ornamented
with
fantastic
spires
of
rock
between
the
buttresses
lay
stripes
of
snow
banding
the
pale
granite
peak
from
crown
to
base
upon
the
north
side
it
fell
off
grandly
precipitous
into
the
deep
upper
cañon
of
king
s
river
this
gorge
after
uniting
a
number
of
immense
rocky
amphitheatres
is
carved
deeply
into
the
granite
two
and
three
thousand
feet
in
a
slightly
curved
line
from
the
summit
it
cuts
westward
through
the
plateau
its
walls
for
the
most
part
descending
in
sharp
bare
slopes
or
lines
of
ragged
the
of
processions
of
pines
we
ourselves
were
upon
the
brink
of
the
south
wall
three
thousand
feet
below
us
lay
the
valley
a
narrow
winding
ribbon
of
green
in
which
here
and
there
gleamed
still
reaches
of
the
river
wherever
the
bottom
widened
to
a
quarter
or
half
a
mile
green
meadows
and
extensive
groves
occupied
the
level
region
upon
every
niche
and
crevice
of
the
walls
up
and
down
sweeping
curves
of
easier
descent
were
grouped
black
companies
of
trees
the
behavior
of
the
forest
is
observed
most
interestingly
from
these
elevated
points
above
the
general
face
of
the
all
over
the
gentle
undulations
of
the
more
level
country
sweeps
an
unbroken
covering
of
trees
reaching
the
edge
of
the
cañon
precipices
they
stand
out
in
bold
groups
upon
the
brink
and
climb
all
over
the
more
ragged
and
broken
surfaces
of
granite
only
the
most
smooth
and
abrupt
precipices
are
bare
here
and
there
a
little
shelf
of
a
foot
or
two
in
width
cracked
into
the
face
of
the
bluff
gives
foothold
to
a
family
of
pines
who
twist
their
roots
into
its
crevices
and
thrive
with
no
soil
from
which
the
roots
may
drink
up
moisture
and
absorb
the
slowly
dissolved
mineral
particles
they
live
by
breathing
alone
moist
vapors
from
the
river
below
and
the
elements
of
the
atmosphere
affording
them
the
substance
of
life
i
believe
no
one
can
study
from
an
elevated
lookout
the
length
and
depth
of
one
of
these
great
sierra
cañons
without
asking
himself
some
profound
geological
questions
your
eyes
range
along
one
or
the
other
wall
the
average
descent
is
immensely
steep
here
and
there
side
ravines
break
down
the
rim
in
deep
lateral
gorges
again
the
wall
advances
in
sharp
salient
precipices
rising
two
or
three
thousand
feet
sheer
and
naked
with
all
the
air
of
a
recent
fracture
at
times
the
two
walls
approach
each
other
standing
in
perpendicular
gateways
toward
the
summits
the
cañon
grows
perhaps
a
little
broader
and
more
and
more
prominent
lateral
ravines
open
into
it
until
at
last
it
receives
the
snow
drainage
of
the
summit
which
descends
through
broad
rounded
amphitheatres
separated
from
each
other
by
sharp
castellated
ridges
looking
down
the
course
of
the
river
vertical
precipices
are
seen
to
be
less
and
less
frequent
the
walls
inclining
to
each
other
more
and
more
gently
until
they
roll
out
on
the
north
and
south
in
round
wooded
ridges
solid
massive
granite
forms
the
material
throughout
its
whole
length
if
you
study
the
topography
upon
the
plateaus
above
one
of
these
cañons
you
will
see
that
the
ridges
upon
one
side
are
reproduced
in
the
other
as
if
the
outlines
of
wavy
topography
had
been
determined
before
the
great
cañon
was
made
it
is
not
easy
to
propose
a
solution
for
this
peculiar
structure
i
think
however
it
is
safe
to
say
that
actual
rending
asunder
of
the
mountain
mass
determined
the
main
outlines
upon
no
other
theory
can
we
account
for
those
blank
walls
where
in
the
upper
course
of
the
cañon
they
descend
in
a
smooth
curve
and
the
rocks
bear
upon
their
curved
sides
the
markings
and
striations
of
glaciers
it
is
easy
to
see
that
those
terrible
gradually
modified
their
form
and
toward
the
the
forces
of
aqueous
erosion
are
clearly
indicated
in
the
rounded
forms
and
broad
undulations
of
the
two
banks
looking
back
from
our
isolated
crag
in
the
direction
of
our
morning
s
ride
we
saw
the
green
hills
break
down
into
the
basin
of
thomas
s
mill
but
the
disc
of
meadow
lay
too
deep
to
be
seen
forests
dense
and
unbroken
grew
to
the
base
of
our
cliff
the
southern
sunlight
reflected
from
its
polished
foliage
gave
to
this
whole
sea
of
spiry
tops
a
peculiar
golden
green
through
which
we
looked
down
among
giant
red
and
purple
trunks
upon
beds
of
bright
mountain
flowers
as
the
afternoon
lengthened
the
summit
rank
of
peaks
glowed
warmer
and
warmer
under
inclined
rays
the
granite
flushed
with
rosy
brightness
between
the
fields
of
glittering
golden
snow
a
mild
pearly
haziness
came
gradually
to
obscure
the
ordinary
sky
and
settling
into
cañon
depths
and
among
the
vast
open
corridors
of
the
summit
veiled
the
savage
sharpness
of
their
details
i
lay
several
hours
sketching
the
outlines
of
the
summit
studying
out
the
systems
of
alpine
drainage
and
getting
acquainted
with
the
long
chain
of
peaks
that
i
might
afterward
know
them
from
other
points
of
view
i
became
convinced
from
the
great
apparent
elevation
and
the
wide
fields
of
snow
that
we
had
not
formerly
deceived
ourselves
as
to
their
great
height
warned
at
length
by
the
deepening
shadow
in
the
king
s
cañon
by
the
heightened
glow
suffusing
the
peaks
and
the
deep
purple
tone
of
the
level
expanse
of
forest
all
forerunners
of
twilight
we
quitted
our
eyrie
crept
carefully
down
over
blocks
of
to
the
horses
and
mounting
were
soon
headed
homeward
in
what
seemed
by
contrast
to
be
almost
a
nocturnal
darkness
wherever
the
ground
opened
level
before
us
we
gave
our
horses
the
rein
and
went
at
a
free
gallop
through
the
forest
the
animals
realized
that
they
were
going
home
and
pressed
forward
with
the
greatest
spirit
a
log
across
our
route
seemed
to
be
an
object
of
special
amusement
to
kaweah
who
seized
the
bits
in
his
teeth
and
dancing
up
crouched
and
cleared
it
with
a
mighty
bound
in
a
manner
that
was
indeed
inspiring
yet
left
one
with
the
impression
that
once
was
enough
of
that
sort
of
thing
fearing
some
manner
of
hostilities
with
him
i
did
my
very
best
to
quiet
kaweah
and
by
the
end
of
an
hour
had
gotten
him
down
to
a
sensible
serious
walk
i
noticed
that
he
insisted
upon
following
his
tracks
of
the
morning
s
march
and
was
not
contented
unless
i
let
him
go
on
the
old
side
of
every
tree
thus
i
became
so
thoroughly
convinced
of
his
faculty
to
follow
the
morning
s
trail
that
i
yielded
all
control
of
him
giving
myself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
dimly
lighted
wood
as
the
sun
at
last
set
the
shadow
deepened
into
an
impressive
gloom
mighty
trunks
rising
into
that
dark
region
of
interlocking
boughs
only
vaguely
defined
themselves
against
the
twilight
sky
we
could
no
longer
see
our
tracks
and
the
confused
rolling
topography
looked
alike
whichever
way
we
turned
kaweah
strode
on
in
his
confident
way
and
i
was
at
last
confirmed
as
to
his
sagacity
by
passing
one
after
another
the
objects
we
had
noted
in
the
morning
thus
for
a
couple
of
hours
we
rode
in
the
darkness
at
length
the
rising
moon
poured
down
through
broken
tents
of
foliage
its
uncertain
silvery
light
which
had
the
effect
of
deepening
all
the
shadows
and
lighting
up
in
the
strangest
manner
little
local
points
here
and
there
ahead
of
us
the
lighted
trees
rose
like
pillars
of
an
ancient
temple
the
forest
which
an
hour
before
overpowered
us
with
a
sense
of
its
dark
enclosure
opened
on
in
distant
avenues
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
as
we
rode
through
denser
or
more
open
passages
the
moon
sailed
into
clear
violet
sky
or
was
obscured
again
by
the
sharply
traced
crests
of
the
pines
ravines
dark
and
unfathomable
yawned
before
us
their
flanks
half
in
shadow
half
in
weird
uncertain
light
blocks
of
white
granite
gleamed
here
and
there
in
contrast
with
the
general
depth
of
shade
at
last
descending
a
hill
there
shone
before
us
a
red
light
the
horses
plunged
forward
at
a
gallop
and
in
a
moment
we
were
in
camp
after
this
ride
we
supped
relishing
our
mountain
fare
and
then
lay
down
upon
blankets
before
a
for
the
mountaineer
s
short
evening
one
keeps
awake
under
stimulus
of
the
sparkling
frosty
air
for
awhile
and
then
turns
in
for
the
night
sleeping
till
daybreak
with
a
light
sound
sleep
the
charm
of
this
forest
life
in
spite
of
its
scientific
interest
and
the
constant
succession
of
exquisite
highly
colored
scenes
would
string
one
s
feelings
up
to
a
high
though
monotonous
key
were
it
not
for
the
picturesqueness
which
the
digger
indians
introduce
upon
every
stream
and
on
all
the
finer
throughout
the
whole
forest
are
found
these
families
of
indians
who
migrate
up
here
during
the
hot
weather
fishing
hunting
gathering
and
lying
off
with
that
peculiar
bummerish
ease
which
associated
with
natural
mock
dignity
throws
about
them
a
singular
and
not
infrequently
deep
interest
i
never
forget
certain
bright
june
sunrises
when
i
have
seen
the
indian
gather
together
his
little
tribe
and
address
them
in
the
heroic
style
concerning
the
vital
importance
of
the
grasshopper
crop
and
the
reverence
due
to
the
giver
of
manzanita
berries
you
come
upon
them
as
you
travel
the
trails
braves
leading
the
way
unhampered
and
free
followed
by
troops
of
submissive
squaws
loaded
down
with
immense
packages
and
baskets
their
death
and
burial
customs
too
have
elements
of
weird
romantic
interest
i
remember
one
morning
when
i
was
awakened
before
dawn
by
wild
unearthly
shrieks
ringing
through
the
forest
and
coming
back
again
in
plaintive
echoes
from
the
hills
all
about
beyond
description
wild
these
wails
of
violent
grief
followed
each
other
with
regular
cadence
dying
away
in
long
despairing
sobs
with
a
marvellous
regularity
they
recurred
never
varying
the
simple
refrain
my
curiosity
was
aroused
so
far
as
to
get
me
out
of
my
blankets
and
after
a
hurried
bath
in
an
icy
stream
i
joined
my
mountaineer
acquaintance
jerry
who
was
to
the
rancheria
to
see
as
he
expressed
it
them
it
seems
my
friend
buck
the
indian
chief
had
the
night
before
lost
his
wife
sally
the
old
and
the
shouts
came
from
professional
mourners
hired
by
her
family
to
prepare
the
body
and
do
up
the
necessary
amount
of
grief
old
widows
and
superannuated
wives
who
have
outlived
other
forms
of
usefulness
gladly
enter
this
singular
profession
they
cut
their
hair
short
and
with
each
new
death
plaster
on
a
fresh
cap
of
pitch
and
ashes
daub
the
face
with
spots
of
tar
and
in
general
array
themselves
as
funeral
experts
the
rancheria
was
astir
when
we
arrived
it
was
a
mere
group
of
half
a
dozen
smoky
hovels
built
of
pine
bark
propped
upon
cones
of
poles
and
arranged
in
a
within
the
edge
of
the
forest
fronting
on
a
brook
and
meadow
jerry
and
i
leaned
our
backs
against
a
large
tree
and
watched
the
group
buck
s
shanty
was
deserted
the
body
of
his
wife
lying
outside
upon
a
blanket
being
prepared
by
two
of
these
funeral
hags
buck
himself
was
quietly
stuffing
his
stomach
with
a
breakfast
of
venison
and
acorns
which
were
handed
him
at
brief
intervals
by
several
sympathizing
squaws
turning
to
jerry
with
a
countenance
of
stolid
seriousness
he
laconically
remarked
my
woman
she
die
very
bad
sundown
pointing
to
the
sun
she
burn
meanwhile
the
rolled
sally
the
old
over
and
over
all
the
while
alternately
howling
the
same
dismal
phrase
indian
relatives
and
friends
having
the
general
air
of
animated
arrived
occasionally
and
sat
down
in
silence
at
a
fire
a
little
removed
from
the
other
diggers
never
once
saluting
them
as
we
walked
back
to
our
camp
i
remarked
on
the
stolid
cruel
expression
of
buck
s
face
but
jerry
to
my
surprise
bade
me
not
judge
too
hastily
he
went
on
to
explain
that
indians
have
just
as
deep
and
tender
attachments
just
as
much
good
sense
and
to
wind
up
with
as
much
human
into
em
as
we
edicated
white
his
own
squaw
had
instilled
this
into
jerry
s
naturally
sentimental
and
credulous
heart
so
i
refrained
from
expressing
my
convictions
concerning
indians
which
i
own
were
formerly
tinged
with
the
most
sanguinary
caucasian
prejudice
jerry
came
for
me
by
appointment
just
before
sunset
and
we
walked
leisurely
across
the
meadow
and
under
lengthening
pine
shadows
to
the
rancheria
no
one
was
stirring
buck
and
the
two
vicarious
mourners
sat
in
his
lodge
door
uttering
low
groans
in
the
opening
before
the
line
of
huts
a
low
pile
of
dry
logs
had
been
carefully
laid
upon
which
outstretched
and
wrapped
in
a
red
blanket
lay
the
dead
form
of
sally
the
old
her
face
covered
in
careful
folds
upon
her
heart
were
a
and
her
last
pappoose
basket
just
as
the
sun
sank
to
the
horizon
one
stepped
out
in
front
of
the
funeral
pile
lifted
up
both
hands
and
gazed
steadily
and
silently
at
the
sun
she
might
have
been
five
minutes
in
this
statuesque
position
her
face
full
of
strange
intensity
of
expression
her
eyes
glittering
the
whole
hard
figure
glowing
with
a
deep
bronze
reflection
suddenly
she
sprang
back
with
the
old
wild
shriek
seized
a
brand
from
one
of
the
and
lighted
the
funeral
heap
when
all
the
indians
came
out
and
grouped
themselves
in
little
knots
around
it
sally
the
old
s
children
clung
about
an
old
mummy
of
a
squaw
who
squatted
upon
the
ground
and
rocked
her
body
to
and
fro
making
a
low
cry
as
of
an
animal
in
pain
all
the
indians
looked
serious
a
group
who
jerry
said
were
relatives
seemed
stupefied
with
grief
upon
a
few
faces
falling
tears
glistened
in
the
light
of
the
fire
which
now
shot
up
red
tongues
high
in
the
air
lighting
up
with
weird
distinctness
every
feature
of
the
whole
group
flames
slowly
lapped
over
consuming
the
blanket
and
caught
the
willow
pappoose
basket
when
buck
saw
this
the
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
he
waved
his
hands
eloquently
looking
up
to
heaven
and
uttered
heartbroken
sobs
the
pappoose
basket
crackled
for
a
moment
flashed
into
a
blaze
and
was
gone
the
two
old
women
yelled
their
sharp
dancing
posturing
gesticulating
toward
the
fire
and
in
slow
measured
chorus
all
the
indians
intoned
in
pathetic
measure
himalaya
himalaya
looking
first
at
the
mound
of
fire
and
then
out
upon
the
fading
sunset
it
was
all
indescribably
strange
monarch
pines
standing
in
solemn
ranks
far
back
into
the
dusky
heart
of
the
forest
glowing
and
brightening
with
pulsating
reflections
of
firelight
the
ring
of
indians
crouching
standing
fixed
like
graven
images
or
swaying
mechanically
to
and
fro
each
tattered
scarlet
and
white
rag
of
their
utterly
squalid
garments
every
expression
of
barbaric
grief
or
dull
stolidity
being
brought
strongly
out
by
the
red
flaming
fire
buck
watched
with
wet
eyes
that
fire
burn
to
ashes
the
body
of
his
wife
of
many
years
the
mother
of
his
group
of
poor
frightened
children
not
a
stoical
savage
but
a
despairing
husband
stood
before
us
i
felt
him
to
be
human
the
body
at
last
sank
into
a
bed
of
flames
which
shot
up
higher
than
ever
with
fountains
of
sparks
and
sucked
together
hiding
the
remains
forever
from
view
at
this
buck
sprang
to
the
front
and
threw
himself
at
the
fire
but
the
two
old
women
seized
each
a
hand
and
dragged
him
back
to
his
children
when
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
stupor
as
we
walked
home
jerry
was
quick
to
ask
didn
t
i
tell
you
injuns
has
feelings
inside
of
em
i
answered
promptly
that
i
was
convinced
and
long
after
as
i
lay
awake
through
many
listening
to
that
shrill
i
felt
as
if
any
policy
toward
the
indians
based
upon
the
assumption
of
their
being
brutes
or
devils
was
nothing
short
of
a
blot
on
this
christian
century
my
sleep
was
light
and
sunrise
found
me
dressed
still
listening
as
under
a
kind
of
spell
to
the
mourners
who
though
evidently
exhausted
at
brief
intervals
uttered
the
cry
alone
and
filled
with
serious
reflections
i
strolled
over
to
the
rancheria
finding
every
one
there
up
and
about
his
morning
duties
the
withdrawn
some
distance
into
the
forest
sat
leaning
against
a
stump
chatting
and
grinning
together
now
and
then
screeching
by
turns
i
asked
revenue
stamp
a
indian
where
buck
was
he
pointed
to
his
hut
and
replied
with
an
affable
smile
he
whiskey
and
who
i
inquired
is
that
fat
girl
with
him
last
night
he
take
her
new
squaw
was
the
answer
i
could
hardly
believe
but
it
was
the
actual
truth
and
i
went
back
to
camp
an
enlightened
but
disillusioned
man
i
left
that
day
and
never
had
an
opportunity
to
free
my
mind
to
jerry
since
then
i
guardedly
avoid
all
discussion
of
the
indian
when
interrogated
i
dodge
or
protest
ignorance
when
pressed
i
have
been
known
to
turn
the
subject
or
if
driven
to
the
wall
i
usually
confess
my
opinion
that
the
quakers
will
have
to
work
a
great
reformation
in
the
indian
before
he
is
really
fit
to
be
exterminated
the
and
indians
told
us
of
a
wonderful
group
of
big
trees
and
about
one
particular
tree
of
unequalled
size
we
found
them
easily
after
a
ride
of
a
few
miles
in
a
northerly
direction
from
our
camp
upon
a
wide
spur
where
they
grew
as
is
their
habit
elsewhere
in
company
with
several
other
coniferous
species
all
grouped
socially
together
heightening
each
other
s
beauty
by
contrasts
of
form
and
color
in
a
rather
open
glade
where
the
ground
was
for
the
most
part
green
with
herbage
and
conspicuously
starred
with
upland
flowers
stood
the
largest
shaft
we
observed
a
fire
had
formerly
burned
off
a
small
segment
of
its
base
not
enough
however
to
injure
the
symmetrical
appearance
it
was
a
slowly
tapering
regularly
round
column
of
about
forty
feet
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
rising
two
hundred
and
feet
adorned
with
a
few
huge
branches
which
start
horizontally
from
the
trunk
but
quickly
turn
down
and
spray
out
the
bark
thick
but
not
rough
is
scored
up
and
down
at
considerable
intervals
with
deep
smooth
grooves
and
is
of
brightest
cinnamon
color
mottled
in
purple
and
yellow
that
which
impresses
one
most
after
its
vast
bulk
the
grand
stateliness
is
the
thin
and
inconspicuous
foliage
which
feathers
out
delicately
on
the
boughs
like
a
mere
mist
of
pale
it
would
seem
nothing
when
compared
with
the
immense
volume
of
tree
for
which
it
must
do
the
ordinary
respirative
duty
but
doubtless
the
bark
performs
a
large
share
of
this
its
papery
lamination
and
porous
structure
fitting
it
eminently
for
that
purpose
near
this
king
of
the
mountains
grew
three
other
trees
one
a
of
about
eight
feet
in
diameter
and
hardly
less
than
three
hundred
feet
high
although
we
did
not
measure
it
estimating
simply
by
comparison
of
its
rise
above
the
whose
height
was
quite
accurately
determined
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
pine
was
branchless
and
as
round
as
if
turned
delicate
in
hue
and
marked
with
a
of
scorings
the
branches
in
nearly
level
poise
grew
long
and
slenderly
out
from
the
shaft
well
covered
with
dark
needles
the
two
remaining
trees
were
firs
which
sprang
from
a
common
root
dividing
slightly
as
they
rose
a
mass
of
feathery
branches
whose
load
of
polished
foliage
for
the
most
part
hid
the
dark
trunk
grace
exquisite
taper
boughs
whose
plumes
of
green
float
lightly
upon
the
air
elasticity
and
symmetry
are
its
characteristics
in
all
directions
this
family
continue
grouping
themselves
always
with
attractive
originality
there
is
something
memorable
in
the
harmonious
yet
positive
colors
of
this
sort
of
forest
first
the
foliage
and
trunk
of
each
separate
tree
contrasts
finely
cinnamon
and
golden
in
the
dark
purple
and
for
the
pine
deep
and
of
fir
the
sky
which
at
this
elevation
of
six
thousand
feet
is
deep
pure
blue
and
often
cloudless
is
seen
through
the
tracery
of
boughs
and
which
cast
downward
fine
and
filmy
shadows
across
the
glowing
trunks
altogether
it
is
a
wonderful
setting
for
the
the
two
firs
judging
by
many
of
equal
size
whose
age
i
have
studied
were
about
three
hundred
years
old
the
pine
still
hale
and
vigorous
not
less
than
five
hundred
and
for
the
king
of
the
mountains
we
can
not
assign
a
probable
age
of
less
than
two
thousand
years
a
mountain
a
fossil
from
deepest
geological
horizon
a
ruin
of
human
art
carry
us
back
into
the
perspective
of
centuries
with
a
force
that
has
become
perhaps
a
little
conventional
no
imperishableness
of
or
of
fragment
of
human
work
broken
pillar
or
image
half
lifted
over
pathetic
desert
none
of
these
link
the
past
and
with
anything
like
the
power
of
these
monuments
of
living
antiquity
trees
that
began
to
grow
before
the
christian
era
and
full
of
hale
vitality
and
green
old
age
still
bid
fair
to
grow
broad
and
high
for
centuries
to
come
who
shall
predict
the
limits
of
this
unexampled
life
there
is
nothing
which
indicates
suffering
or
degeneracy
in
the
as
a
species
i
find
pathological
hints
that
several
other
far
younger
species
in
the
same
forest
are
gradually
giving
up
their
struggle
for
existence
that
singular
species
appears
to
me
to
suffer
from
extremes
of
temperature
and
dryness
and
notably
from
ravenous
parasites
of
the
mistletoe
type
at
the
other
extreme
the
has
about
half
given
up
the
fight
against
cold
and
storms
its
young
are
dwarfed
or
huddled
in
thickets
with
such
mode
of
growth
that
they
may
never
make
trees
of
full
stature
while
higher
up
standing
among
bare
rocks
and
fields
of
ice
far
above
all
living
trees
are
the
stark
white
skeletons
of
noble
dead
specimens
their
blanched
forms

and
defiant

by
a
marvellous
hardness
of

and
only

by
the

still

it
is
then
the

the
bland
regular
climate
which
give
such
long
life
and
not

if
one

and
there
a
hollow

gazing

and

flutings
from
broad
firmly
planted
base
up
and
on
through
the

huge
branches
and
among
the
pale
clouds
of
filmy
green
traced
in
open
network
upon
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
groups
of
this
ancient
race
grow
along
the
middle
heights
of
the
sierra
for
almost
two
hundred
miles
marking
a
line
of
groves
through
the
forest
of
lesser
trees
still
retaining
their
power
of
reproduction
ripening
cones
with
regularity
whose
seed
germinates
springs
up
and
grows
with
apparently
as
great
vital
power
as
the
descendants
of
younger
conifers
nor
are
these
their
only
remarkable
characteristics
they
possess
hardly
any
roots
at
all
several
in
each
grove
have
been
blown
down
and
lie
slowly
decomposing
they
are
found
usually
to
have
rested
upon
the
ground
with
a
few
short
feet
penetrating
the
earth
for
a
little
way
too
soon
for
my
pleasure
the
time
came
when
we
must
turn
our
backs
upon
these
stately
groves
and
push
up
toward
the
snow
our
route
lay
eastward
between
the
king
s
and
kaweah
rivers
rising
as
we
marched
the
vegetation
as
well
as
the
barometer
accurately
measuring
the
change
we
reached
our
camp
on
the
big
meadow
plateau
on
the
of
june
and
that
night
the
thermometer
fell
to
above
zero
this
cold
was
followed
by
a
chilly
overcast
morning
and
about
ten
o
clock
an
snowstorm
set
in
wind
howled
fiercely
through
the
trees
coming
down
from
the
mountains
in
terribly
powerful
gusts
the
green
meadow
was
soon
buried
under
snow
and
we
explorers
who
had
no
tent
hid
ourselves
under
piles
of
brush
and
on
the
lee
side
of
hospitable
stones
our
scant
supply
of
blankets
was
a
poor
defence
against
such
inclemency
so
we
crawled
out
and
made
a
huge
around
which
we
sat
for
the
rest
of
the
day
during
the
afternoon
we
were
visited
a
couple
of
hunters
with
their
rifles
over
their
shoulders
seeing
the
smoke
of
our
followed
it
through
the
woods
and
joined
our
circle
they
were
typical
mountaineers
outcasts
from
society
discontented
with
the
world
comforting
themselves
in
the
solitude
of
nature
by
the
occasional
excitement
of
a
one
was
a
cherokee
rather
over
six
feet
high
powerfully
built
and
picturesquely
dressed
in
buckskin
breeches
and
green
jacket
a
sort
of
trovatore
hat
completed
his
costume
and
gave
him
an
animated
appearance
the
other
was
unmistakably
a
who
had
dangled
into
a
pair
of
butternut
jeans
his
greasy
flannel
shirt
was
pinned
together
with
thorns
in
lieu
of
buttons
and
his
hat
fastened
back
in
the
same
way
having
lost
its
stiffness
by
continual
wetting
the
cherokee
had
a
long
manly
stride
and
the
pike
a
rickety
sort
of
shuffle
his
anatomy
was
bad
his
physical
condition
worse
and
i
think
he
added
to
that
a
sort
of
pride
in
his
own
awkwardness
seeming
to
have
a
principle
of
suspension
somewhere
about
his
shoulders
which
maintained
his
head
at
about
the
right
elevation
above
the
ground
he
kept
up
a
good
rate
in
walking
without
apparently
making
an
effort
his
body
swayed
with
a
peculiar
corkscrew
motion
and
his
long
mississippi
rifle
waved
to
and
fro
through
the
air
we
all
noticed
the
utter
contrast
between
them
as
these
two
men
approached
our
fire
the
hunter
s
taciturnity
is
a
but
they
had
evidently
lived
so
long
an
isolated
life
that
they
were
too
glad
of
any
company
to
play
it
unfailingly
so
it
was
they
who
opened
the
conversation
we
found
that
they
were
now
camped
only
a
from
us
were
hunting
for
and
had
already
accumulated
a
very
large
number
they
offered
us
plenty
of
venison
and
were
greatly
interested
in
our
proposed
journeys
into
the
high
mountains
from
them
we
learned
that
they
had
themselves
penetrated
farther
than
any
others
and
had
only
given
up
the
exploration
after
wandering
fruitlessly
among
the
cañons
for
a
month
they
told
us
that
not
even
indians
had
crossed
the
sierras
to
the
east
and
that
if
we
did
succeed
in
reaching
this
summit
we
would
certainly
be
the
first
we
learned
from
them
also
that
a
mile
to
the
northward
was
a
great
herd
of
cattle
in
charge
of
a
party
of
mexicans
fleeing
before
the
continued
drought
of
the
plains
all
the
of
california
drove
the
remains
of
their
starved
herds
either
to
the
coast
or
to
the
high
sierras
and
grazed
upon
the
summer
pastures
descending
in
the
autumn
and
living
upon
the
dry
grasses
until
under
the
influence
of
winter
rains
the
plains
again
clothe
themselves
with
pasturage
the
following
morning
having
received
a
present
of
two
deer
from
the
hunters
we
packed
our
animals
and
started
eastward
passing
after
a
few
minutes
ride
the
encampment
of
the
spaniards
about
four
thousand
cattle
roamed
over
the
plateau
and
were
only
looked
after
once
or
twice
a
week
the
four
spaniards
divided
their
time
between
drinking
coffee
and
playing
cards
they
were
engaged
in
the
latter
amusement
when
we
passed
them
and
although
we
halted
and
tried
to
get
some
information
they
only
answered
us
in
monosyllables
and
continued
their
game
to
the
eastward
the
plateau
rose
toward
the
high
mountains
in
immense
granite
steps
we
rode
pleasantly
through
the
forest
over
these
level
tables
and
climbed
with
difficulty
the
rugged
fronts
each
successive
step
bringing
us
nearer
the
mountains
and
giving
us
a
view
here
and
there
the
granite
rose
through
the
forest
in
broad
smooth
domes
and
many
times
we
were
obliged
to
climb
these
rocky
slopes
at
the
peril
of
our
animals
lives
after
several
days
of
marching
and
countermarching
we
gave
up
the
attempt
to
push
farther
in
a
southeast
direction
and
turned
north
toward
the
great
cañon
of
king
s
river
which
we
hoped
might
lead
us
up
to
the
snow
group
reaching
the
brink
of
this
gorge
we
observed
about
down
the
slope
and
standing
at
equal
levels
on
both
flanks
singular
embankments
shelves
a
thousand
feet
in
width
built
at
a
height
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
the
valley
bottom
their
smooth
evenly
graded
summits
rising
higher
and
higher
to
the
eastward
on
the
until
they
joined
the
snow
they
were
evidently
the
lateral
moraines
of
a
vast
extinct
glacier
and
that
opposite
us
seemed
to
offer
an
easy
ride
into
the
heart
of
the
mountains
with
great
difficulty
we
descended
the
long
slope
through
chaparral
and
forest
reaching
at
length
the
level
smooth
glacier
bottom
here
threading
its
way
through
alternate
groves
and
meadows
was
the
king
s
river
a
stream
not
over
thirty
feet
in
width
but
rushing
with
all
the
force
of
a
torrent
its
icy
temperature
was
very
refreshing
after
our
weary
climb
down
the
wall
by
a
series
of
long
zigzags
we
succeeded
in
leading
our
animals
up
the
flank
to
the
top
of
the
north
moraine
and
here
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
causeway
almost
as
smooth
as
a
railroad
embankment
its
fluted
crest
enclosed
three
separate
pathways
each
a
hundred
feet
wide
divided
from
one
another
by
roughly
laid
trains
of
rocks
showing
it
evidently
to
be
a
compound
moraine
as
we
ascended
toward
the
mountains
the
causeway
was
more
and
more
isolated
from
the
cliff
until
the
depression
between
them
widened
to
half
a
mile
and
to
at
least
five
hundred
feet
deep
throughout
nearly
a
whole
day
we
rode
comfortably
along
at
a
gentle
grade
reaching
at
evening
the
region
of
the
snow
where
among
innumerable
huge
granite
blocks
we
threaded
our
way
in
search
of
a
the
mountain
amphitheatre
which
gave
rise
to
the
king
s
river
opened
to
the
east
a
broad
valley
into
which
we
at
length
climbed
and
among
scattered
groves
of
alpine
pines
and
on
patches
of
meadow
rode
eastward
till
twilight
watching
the
high
pyramidal
peak
which
lay
directly
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
by
sunset
we
had
gone
as
far
as
we
could
take
the
animals
and
in
full
view
of
our
goal
camped
for
the
night
the
form
of
the
mountain
at
the
head
of
our
ravine
was
purely
gothic
a
thousand
upspringing
spires
and
pinnacles
pierce
the
sky
in
every
direction
the
cliffs
and
are
everywhere
ornamented
with
countless
turrets
crowning
the
wall
to
the
south
of
our
camp
were
series
of
these
jagged
forms
standing
out
against
the
sky
like
a
procession
of
colossal
statues
whichever
way
we
turned
we
were
met
by
some
extraordinary
fulness
of
detail
every
mass
seemed
to
have
the
highest
possible
ornamental
finish
along
the
lower
flanks
of
the
walls
tall
straight
pines
the
last
of
the
forest
were
relieved
against
the
cliffs
and
the
same
slender
forms
although
carved
in
granite
surmounted
every
ridge
and
peak
through
this
wide
zone
of
forest
we
had
now
passed
and
from
its
perpetual
shadow
had
come
out
among
the
few
black
groves
of
fir
into
a
brilliant
alpine
sunshine
the
light
although
surprisingly
lively
was
of
a
purity
and
refinement
quite
different
from
the
strong
glare
of
the
plains
iii
the
ascent
of
mount
tyndall
morning
dawned
brightly
upon
our
bivouac
among
a
cluster
of
dark
firs
in
the
mountain
corridor
opened
by
an
ancient
glacier
of
king
s
river
into
the
heart
of
the
sierras
it
dawned
a
trifle
sooner
than
we
could
have
wished
but
professor
brewer
and
hoffman
had
breakfasted
before
sunrise
and
were
off
with
barometer
and
theodolite
upon
their
shoulders
purposing
to
ascend
our
amphitheatre
to
its
head
and
climb
a
great
pyramidal
peak
which
swelled
up
against
the
eastern
sky
closing
the
view
in
that
direction
we
who
remained
in
camp
spent
the
day
in
overhauling
campaign
materials
and
preparing
for
a
grand
assault
upon
the
summits
for
a
couple
of
hours
we
could
descry
our
friends
through
the
their
minute
black
forms
moving
slowly
on
among
piles
of
giant
now
and
then
lost
again
coming
to
view
and
at
last
disappearing
altogether
it
was
twilight
of
evening
and
almost
eight
o
clock
when
they
came
back
to
camp
brewer
leading
the
way
hoffman
following
and
as
they
sat
down
by
our
fire
without
uttering
a
word
we
read
upon
their
faces
terrible
fatigue
so
we
hastened
to
give
them
supper
of
coffee
and
soup
bread
and
venison
which
resulted
after
a
time
in
our
getting
in
return
the
story
of
the
day
for
eight
whole
hours
they
had
worked
up
over
granite
and
snow
mounting
ridge
after
ridge
till
the
summit
was
made
about
two
o
clock
these
snowy
crests
bounding
our
view
at
the
eastward
we
had
all
along
taken
to
be
the
summits
of
the
sierra
and
brewer
had
supposed
himself
to
be
climbing
a
dominant
peak
from
which
he
might
look
eastward
over
owen
s
valley
and
out
upon
leagues
of
desert
instead
of
this
a
vast
wall
of
mountains
lifted
still
higher
than
his
peak
rose
beyond
a
tremendous
cañon
which
lay
like
a
trough
between
the
two
parallel
ranks
of
peaks
hoffman
showed
us
on
his
the
profile
of
this
new
range
and
i
instantly
recognized
the
peaks
which
i
had
seen
from
mariposa
whose
great
white
pile
had
led
me
to
believe
them
the
highest
points
of
california
for
a
couple
of
months
my
friends
had
made
me
the
target
of
plenty
of
pleasant
banter
about
my
highest
land
which
they
lost
faith
in
as
we
climbed
from
thomas
s
mill
i
too
becoming
a
trifle
anxious
about
it
but
now
that
the
truth
had
burst
upon
brewer
and
hoffman
they
could
not
find
words
to
describe
the
terribleness
and
grandeur
of
the
deep
cañon
or
for
picturing
those
huge
crags
towering
in
line
at
the
east
their
peak
as
indicated
by
the
barometer
was
in
the
region
of
thirteen
thousand
four
hundred
feet
and
a
level
across
to
the
farther
range
showed
its
crests
to
be
at
least
fifteen
hundred
feet
higher
they
had
spent
hours
upon
the
summit
scanning
the
eastern
horizon
and
ranging
downward
into
the
labyrinth
of
gulfs
below
and
had
come
at
last
with
reluctance
to
the
belief
that
to
cross
this
gorge
and
ascend
the
eastern
wall
of
peaks
was
utterly
impossible
brewer
and
hoffman
were
old
climbers
and
their
verdict
of
impossible
oppressed
me
as
i
lay
awake
thinking
of
it
but
early
next
morning
i
had
made
up
my
mind
and
taking
cotter
aside
i
asked
him
in
an
easy
manner
whether
he
would
like
to
penetrate
the
terra
incognita
with
me
at
the
risk
of
our
necks
provided
brewer
should
consent
in
a
frank
courageous
tone
he
answered
after
his
usual
mode
why
not
stout
of
limb
stronger
yet
in
heart
of
iron
endurance
and
a
quiet
unexcited
temperament
and
better
yet
deeply
devoted
to
me
i
felt
that
cotter
was
the
one
comrade
i
would
choose
to
face
death
with
for
i
believed
there
was
in
his
manhood
no
room
for
fear
or
shirk
it
was
a
trying
moment
for
brewer
when
we
found
him
and
volunteered
to
attempt
a
campaign
for
the
top
of
california
because
he
felt
a
certain
fatherly
responsibility
over
our
youth
a
natural
desire
that
we
should
not
deposit
our
triturated
remains
in
some
undiscoverable
hole
among
the
feldspathic
granites
but
like
a
true
disciple
of
science
this
was
at
last
overbalanced
by
his
intense
desire
to
know
more
of
the
unexplored
region
he
freely
confessed
that
he
believed
the
plan
madness
and
hoffman
too
told
us
we
might
as
well
attempt
to
get
on
a
cloud
as
to
try
the
peak
as
brewer
gradually
yielded
his
consent
i
saw
by
his
conversation
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
success
so
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
making
preparations
our
were
in
excellent
condition
the
hobnails
firm
and
new
we
laid
out
a
barometer
a
compass
a
a
set
of
wet
and
dry
thermometers
with
bread
cooked
beans
and
venison
enough
to
last
a
week
rolled
them
all
in
blankets
making
two
packs
strapped
firmly
together
with
loops
for
the
arms
which
by
brewer
s
estimate
weighed
forty
pounds
apiece
gardiner
declared
he
would
accompany
us
to
the
summit
of
the
first
range
to
look
over
into
the
gulf
we
were
to
cross
and
at
last
brewer
and
hoffman
also
concluded
to
go
up
with
us
quite
too
early
for
our
profit
we
all
betook
ourselves
to
bed
vainly
hoping
to
get
a
long
refreshing
sleep
from
which
we
should
arise
ready
for
our
tramp
never
a
man
welcomed
those
first
gray
streaks
in
the
east
gladder
than
i
did
unless
it
may
be
cotter
who
has
in
later
years
confessed
that
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
that
night
long
before
sunrise
we
had
finished
our
breakfast
and
were
under
way
hoffman
kindly
bearing
my
pack
and
brewer
cotter
s
our
way
led
due
east
up
the
amphitheatre
and
toward
mount
brewer
as
we
had
named
the
great
pyramidal
peak
awhile
after
leaving
camp
slant
sunlight
streamed
in
among
gilded
pinnacles
along
the
slope
of
mount
brewer
touching
here
and
there
in
broad
dashes
of
yellow
the
gray
walls
which
rose
sweeping
up
on
either
hand
like
the
sides
of
a
ship
our
way
along
the
valley
s
middle
ascended
over
a
number
of
huge
steps
rounded
and
abrupt
at
whose
bases
were
pools
of
transparent
edged
with
rude
piles
of
erratic
glacier
blocks
scattered
companies
of
alpine
firs
of
red
bark
and
having
darkness
of
foliage
with
fields
of
snow
under
sheltering
cliffs
and
bits
of
softest
velvet
meadow
clouded
with
minute
blue
and
white
flowers
as
we
climbed
the
gorge
grew
narrow
and
sharp
both
sides
wilder
and
the
spurs
which
projected
from
them
nearly
overhanging
the
middle
of
the
valley
towered
above
us
with
more
and
more
severe
sculpture
we
frequently
crossed
deep
fields
of
snow
and
at
last
reached
the
level
of
the
highest
pines
where
long
slopes
of
swept
down
from
either
cliff
meeting
in
the
middle
over
and
among
these
immense
blocks
often
twenty
and
thirty
feet
high
we
were
obliged
to
climb
hearing
far
below
us
the
subterranean
gurgle
of
streams
interlocking
spurs
nearly
closed
the
gorge
behind
us
our
last
view
was
out
a
granite
gateway
formed
of
two
nearly
vertical
precipices
jutting
and
plunging
down
into
a
field
of
angular
bowlders
which
fill
the
the
eye
ranged
out
from
this
open
gateway
overlooking
the
great
king
s
cañon
with
its
walls
the
domes
of
granite
upon
big
meadows
and
the
undulating
stretch
of
forest
which
descends
to
the
plain
the
gorge
turning
southward
we
rounded
a
sort
of
mountain
promontory
which
closing
the
view
behind
us
shut
us
up
in
the
bottom
of
a
perfect
basin
in
front
lay
a
placid
lake
reflecting
the
intense
of
the
sky
granite
stained
with
purple
and
red
sank
into
it
upon
one
side
and
a
broad
spotless
field
of
snow
came
down
to
its
margin
upon
the
other
from
a
pile
of
large
granite
blocks
forty
or
fifty
feet
above
the
we
could
look
down
fully
a
hundred
feet
through
the
transparent
water
to
where
bowlders
and
pebbles
were
strewn
upon
the
stone
bottom
we
had
now
reached
the
base
of
mount
brewer
and
were
skirting
its
southern
spurs
in
a
wide
open
corridor
surrounded
in
all
directions
by
lofty
granite
crags
from
two
to
four
thousand
feet
high
above
the
limits
of
vegetation
rocks
lakes
of
deep
heavenly
blue
and
white
trackless
snows
were
grouped
closely
about
us
two
sounds
a
sharp
little
cry
of
martens
and
occasional
heavy
crashes
of
falling
rock
saluted
us
climbing
became
exceedingly
difficult
light
air
for
we
had
already
reached
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
feet
beginning
to
tell
upon
our
lungs
to
such
an
extent
that
my
friend
who
had
taken
turns
with
me
in
carrying
my
pack
was
unable
to
do
so
any
longer
and
i
adjusted
it
to
my
own
shoulders
for
the
rest
of
the
day
after
four
hours
of
slow
laborious
work
we
made
the
base
of
the
slope
which
rose
about
a
thousand
feet
to
a
in
the
western
that
range
upon
which
mount
brewer
is
so
prominent
a
point
we
were
nearly
an
hour
in
toiling
up
this
slope
over
an
uncertain
footing
which
gave
way
at
almost
every
step
at
last
when
almost
at
the
top
we
paused
to
take
breath
and
then
all
walked
out
upon
the
crest
laid
off
our
packs
and
sat
down
together
upon
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
for
a
few
moments
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
sierras
are
here
two
parallel
summit
ranges
we
were
upon
the
crest
of
the
western
ridge
and
looked
down
into
a
gulf
five
thousand
feet
deep
sinking
from
our
feet
in
abrupt
cliffs
nearly
or
quite
two
thousand
feet
whose
base
plunged
into
a
broad
field
of
snow
lying
steep
and
smooth
for
a
great
distance
but
broken
near
its
foot
by
craggy
steps
often
a
thousand
feet
high
vague
blue
haze
obscured
the
lost
depths
hiding
details
giving
a
bottomless
distance
out
of
which
like
the
breath
of
wind
floated
up
a
faint
tremble
vibrating
upon
the
senses
yet
never
clearly
heard
rising
on
the
other
side
cliff
above
cliff
precipice
piled
upon
precipice
rock
over
rock
up
against
sky
towered
the
most
gigantic
in
america
culminating
in
a
noble
pile
of
granite
and
snow
how
grand
and
inviting
looked
its
white
form
its
untrodden
unknown
crest
so
high
and
pure
in
the
clear
strong
blue
i
looked
at
it
as
one
contemplating
the
purpose
of
his
life
and
for
just
one
moment
i
would
have
rather
liked
to
dodge
that
purpose
or
to
have
waited
or
have
found
some
excellent
reason
why
i
might
not
go
but
all
this
quickly
vanished
leaving
a
cheerful
resolve
to
go
ahead
from
the
two
opposing
singular
thin
ridges
of
stone
jutted
out
dividing
the
sides
of
the
gulf
into
a
series
of
amphitheatres
each
one
a
labyrinth
of
ice
and
rock
piercing
thick
beds
of
snow
sprang
up
knobs
and
straight
isolated
spires
of
rock
mere
obelisks
curiously
carved
by
frost
their
rigid
slender
forms
casting
a
blue
sharp
shadow
upon
the
snow
embosomed
in
depressions
of
ice
or
resting
on
broken
ledges
were
azure
lakes
deeper
in
tone
than
the
sky
which
at
this
altitude
even
at
midday
has
a
violet
duskiness
to
the
south
not
more
than
eight
miles
a
wall
of
peaks
stood
across
the
gulf
dividing
the
king
s
which
flowed
north
at
our
feet
from
the
kern
river
that
flowed
down
the
trough
in
the
opposite
direction
i
did
not
wonder
that
brewer
and
hoffman
pronounced
our
undertaking
impossible
but
when
i
looked
at
cotter
there
was
such
complete
bravery
in
his
eye
that
i
asked
him
if
he
was
ready
to
start
his
old
answer
why
not
left
the
initiative
with
me
so
i
told
professor
brewer
that
we
would
bid
him
our
friends
helped
us
on
with
our
packs
in
silence
and
as
we
shook
hands
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
party
before
he
let
go
of
my
hand
professor
brewer
asked
me
for
my
plan
and
i
had
to
own
that
i
had
but
one
which
was
to
reach
the
highest
peak
in
the
range
after
looking
in
every
direction
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
i
saw
as
yet
no
practicable
way
we
bade
them
a
receiving
their
god
bless
you
in
return
and
started
southward
along
the
range
to
look
for
some
possible
cliff
to
descend
brewer
gardiner
and
hoffman
turned
north
to
push
upward
to
the
summit
of
mount
brewer
and
complete
their
observations
we
saw
them
whenever
we
halted
until
at
last
on
the
very
summit
their
microscopic
forms
were
for
the
last
time
discernible
with
very
great
difficulty
we
climbed
a
peak
which
surmounted
our
wall
just
to
the
south
of
the
pass
and
looking
over
the
eastern
brink
found
that
the
precipice
was
still
sheer
and
unbroken
in
one
place
where
the
snow
lay
against
it
to
the
very
top
we
went
to
its
edge
and
contemplated
the
slide
about
three
thousand
feet
of
unbroken
white
at
a
fearfully
steep
angle
lay
below
us
we
threw
a
stone
over
and
watched
it
bound
until
it
was
lost
in
the
distance
after
fearful
leaps
we
could
only
detect
it
by
the
flashings
of
snow
where
it
struck
and
as
these
were
in
some
instances
three
hundred
feet
apart
we
decided
not
to
launch
our
own
valuable
bodies
and
the
still
more
precious
barometer
after
it
there
seemed
but
one
possible
way
to
reach
our
goal
that
was
to
make
our
way
along
the
summit
of
the
cross
ridge
which
projected
between
the
two
ranges
this
divide
sprang
out
from
our
mount
brewer
wall
about
four
miles
to
the
south
of
us
to
reach
it
we
must
climb
up
and
down
over
the
indented
edge
of
the
mount
brewer
wall
in
attempting
to
do
this
we
had
a
rather
lively
time
scaling
a
sharp
granite
needle
where
we
found
our
course
completely
stopped
by
precipices
four
and
five
hundred
feet
in
height
ahead
of
us
the
summit
continued
to
be
broken
into
fantastic
pinnacles
leaving
us
no
hope
of
making
our
way
along
it
so
we
sought
the
most
broken
part
of
the
eastern
descent
and
began
to
climb
down
the
heavy
knapsacks
besides
wearing
our
shoulders
gradually
into
a
state
overbalanced
us
terribly
and
kept
us
in
constant
danger
of
pitching
headlong
at
last
taking
them
off
cotter
climbed
down
until
he
had
found
a
upon
a
cleft
of
rock
then
i
lowered
them
to
him
with
our
lasso
afterward
descending
cautiously
to
his
side
taking
my
turn
in
pioneering
downward
receiving
the
freight
of
knapsacks
by
lasso
as
before
in
this
manner
we
consumed
more
than
half
the
afternoon
in
descending
a
thousand
feet
of
broken
precipitous
slope
and
it
was
almost
sunset
when
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
fields
of
level
snow
which
lay
white
and
thick
over
the
whole
interior
slope
of
the
amphitheatre
the
gorge
below
us
seemed
utterly
impassable
at
our
backs
the
mount
brewer
wall
rose
either
in
sheer
cliffs
or
in
broken
rugged
stairway
such
as
had
offered
us
our
descent
from
this
cruel
dilemma
the
cross
divide
furnished
the
only
hope
and
the
sole
chance
of
scaling
that
was
at
its
junction
with
the
mount
brewer
wall
toward
this
point
we
directed
our
course
marching
wearily
over
stretches
of
dense
frozen
snow
and
regions
of
reaching
about
sunset
the
last
alcove
of
the
amphitheatre
just
at
the
foot
of
the
mount
brewer
wall
it
was
evidently
impossible
for
us
to
attempt
to
climb
it
that
evening
and
we
looked
about
the
desolate
recesses
for
a
sheltered
a
high
granite
wall
surrounded
us
upon
three
sides
recurring
to
the
southward
in
long
elliptical
curves
no
part
of
the
summit
being
less
than
two
thousand
feet
above
us
the
higher
crags
not
infrequently
reaching
three
thousand
feet
a
single
field
of
snow
swept
around
the
base
of
the
rock
and
covered
the
whole
amphitheatre
except
where
a
few
spikes
and
rounded
masses
of
granite
rose
through
it
and
where
two
frozen
lakes
with
their
blue
broke
the
monotonous
surface
through
the
white
of
our
amphitheatre
as
through
a
frame
we
looked
eastward
upon
the
summit
group
not
a
tree
not
a
vestige
of
vegetation
in
sight
sky
snow
and
granite
the
only
elements
in
this
wild
picture
after
searching
for
a
shelter
we
at
last
found
a
granite
crevice
near
the
margin
of
one
of
the
frozen
lakes
a
sort
of
shelf
just
large
enough
for
cotter
and
me
where
we
hastened
to
make
our
bed
having
first
filled
the
canteen
from
a
small
stream
that
trickled
over
the
ice
knowing
that
in
a
few
moments
the
rapid
chill
would
freeze
it
we
ate
our
supper
of
cold
venison
and
bread
and
whittled
from
the
sides
of
the
wooden
shavings
enough
to
warm
water
for
a
cup
of
miserably
tepid
tea
and
then
packing
our
provisions
and
instruments
away
at
the
head
of
the
shelf
rolled
ourselves
in
our
blankets
and
lay
down
to
enjoy
the
view
after
such
fatiguing
exercises
the
mind
has
an
almost
abnormal
clearness
whether
this
is
wholly
from
within
or
due
to
the
intensely
vitalizing
mountain
air
i
am
not
sure
probably
both
contribute
to
the
state
of
exaltation
in
which
all
alpine
climbers
find
themselves
the
solid
granite
gave
me
a
luxurious
repose
and
i
lay
on
the
edge
of
our
little
rock
niche
and
watched
the
strange
yet
brilliant
scene
all
the
snow
of
our
recess
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
high
granite
wall
to
the
west
but
the
kern
divide
which
curved
around
us
from
the
southeast
was
in
full
light
its
broken
sky
line
battlemented
and
adorned
with
innumerable
spires
and
pinnacles
was
a
mass
of
glowing
orange
intensely
defined
against
the
deep
violet
sky
at
the
open
end
of
our
horseshoe
amphitheatre
to
the
east
its
floor
of
snow
rounded
over
in
a
smooth
brink
overhanging
precipices
which
sank
two
thousand
feet
into
the
king
s
cañon
across
the
gulf
rose
the
whole
procession
of
summit
peaks
their
lower
halves
rooted
in
a
deep
sombre
shadow
cast
by
the
western
wall
the
heights
bathed
in
a
warm
purple
haze
in
which
the
irregular
marbling
of
snow
burned
with
a
pure
crimson
light
a
few
fleecy
clouds
dyed
fiery
orange
drifted
slowly
eastward
across
the
narrow
zone
of
sky
which
stretched
from
summit
to
summit
like
a
roof
at
times
the
sound
of
waterfalls
faint
and
mingled
with
echoes
floated
up
through
the
still
air
the
snow
near
by
lay
in
cold
ghastly
shade
warmed
here
and
there
in
strange
flashes
by
light
reflected
downward
from
drifting
clouds
the
sombre
waste
about
us
the
deep
violet
vault
overhead
those
far
summits
glowing
with
reflected
rose
the
deep
impenetrable
gloom
which
filled
the
gorge
and
slowly
and
with
stealth
climbed
the
mountain
wall
extinguishing
the
red
light
combined
to
produce
an
effect
which
may
not
be
described
nor
can
i
more
than
hint
at
the
contrast
between
the
brilliancy
of
the
scene
under
full
light
and
the
cold
repose
which
followed
when
the
wan
cliffs
and
pallid
snow
were
all
overshadowed
with
ghostly
gray
a
sudden
chill
enveloped
us
stars
in
a
moment
crowded
through
the
dark
heaven
flashing
with
a
frosty
splendor
the
snow
congealed
the
brooks
ceased
to
flow
and
under
the
powerful
sudden
leverage
of
frost
immense
blocks
were
dislodged
all
along
the
mountain
summits
and
came
thundering
down
the
slopes
booming
upon
the
ice
dashing
wildly
upon
rocks
under
the
lee
of
our
shelf
we
felt
quite
safe
but
neither
cotter
nor
i
could
help
being
startled
and
jumping
just
a
little
as
these
missiles
weighing
often
many
tons
struck
the
ledge
over
our
heads
and
whizzed
down
the
gorge
their
stroke
resounding
fainter
and
fainter
until
at
last
only
a
confused
echo
reached
us
the
thermometer
at
nine
o
clock
marked
twenty
degrees
above
zero
we
set
the
minimum
and
rolled
ourselves
together
for
the
night
the
longer
i
lay
the
less
i
liked
that
shelf
of
granite
it
grew
hard
in
time
and
cold
also
my
bones
seeming
to
approach
actual
contact
with
the
chilled
rock
moreover
i
found
that
even
so
vigorous
a
circulation
as
mine
was
not
enough
to
warm
up
the
ledge
to
anything
like
a
comfortable
temperature
a
single
thickness
of
blanket
is
a
better
mattress
than
none
but
the
larger
crystals
of
orthoclase
protruding
plentifully
punched
my
back
and
caused
me
to
revolve
on
a
horizontal
axis
with
precision
and
frequency
how
i
loved
cotter
how
i
hugged
him
and
got
warm
while
our
backs
gradually
petrified
till
we
whirled
over
and
thawed
them
out
together
the
slant
of
that
bed
was
diagonal
and
excessive
down
it
we
slid
till
the
ice
chilled
us
awake
and
we
crawled
back
and
chocked
ourselves
up
with
bits
of
granite
inserted
under
my
ribs
and
shoulders
in
this
pleasant
position
we
got
dozing
again
and
there
stole
over
me
a
most
comfortable
ease
the
granite
softened
perceptibly
i
was
delightfully
warm
and
sank
into
an
industrious
slumber
which
lasted
with
great
soundness
till
four
when
we
rose
and
ate
our
breakfast
of
frozen
venison
the
thermometer
stood
at
two
above
zero
everything
was
frozen
tight
except
the
canteen
which
we
had
prudently
kept
between
us
all
night
stars
still
blazed
brightly
and
the
moon
hidden
from
us
by
western
cliffs
shone
in
pale
reflection
upon
the
rocky
heights
to
the
east
which
rose
dimly
white
up
from
the
impenetrable
shadows
of
the
cañon
silence
cold
ghastly
dimness
in
which
loomed
huge
forms
the
biting
frostiness
of
the
air
wrought
upon
our
feelings
as
we
shouldered
our
packs
and
started
with
slow
pace
to
climb
toward
the
soon
to
our
dismay
we
found
the
straps
had
so
chafed
our
shoulders
that
the
weight
gave
us
great
pain
and
obliged
us
to
pad
them
with
our
handkerchiefs
and
extra
socks
which
remedy
did
not
wholly
relieve
us
from
the
constant
wearing
pain
of
the
heavy
load
directing
our
steps
southward
toward
a
niche
in
the
wall
which
bounded
us
only
half
a
mile
distant
we
travelled
over
a
continuous
frozen
so
densely
as
scarcely
to
yield
at
all
to
our
tread
at
the
same
time
compressing
enough
to
make
that
crisp
frosty
sound
which
we
all
used
to
enjoy
even
before
we
knew
from
the
books
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
severe
name
of
regulation
as
we
advanced
the
snow
sloped
more
and
more
steeply
up
toward
the
crags
till
by
and
by
it
became
quite
dangerous
causing
us
to
cut
steps
with
cotter
s
large
a
slow
tedious
operation
requiring
patience
of
a
pretty
permanent
kind
in
this
way
we
spent
a
quiet
social
hour
or
so
the
sun
had
not
yet
reached
us
being
shut
out
by
the
high
amphitheatre
wall
but
its
cheerful
light
reflected
downward
from
a
number
of
higher
crags
filling
the
recess
with
the
brightness
of
day
and
putting
out
of
existence
those
shadows
which
so
sombrely
darkened
the
earlier
hours
to
look
back
when
we
stopped
to
rest
was
to
realize
our
danger
that
smooth
swift
slope
of
ice
carrying
the
eye
down
a
thousand
feet
to
the
margin
of
a
frozen
mirror
of
ice
ribs
and
needles
of
rock
piercing
up
through
the
snow
so
closely
grouped
that
had
we
fallen
a
miracle
only
might
save
us
from
being
dashed
this
led
to
rather
deeper
steps
and
greater
care
that
our
burdens
should
be
held
more
nearly
over
the
centre
of
gravity
and
a
pleasant
relief
when
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
snow
and
sat
down
on
a
block
of
granite
to
breathe
and
look
up
in
search
of
a
way
up
the
cliff
of
broken
surface
among
the
lines
of
fracture
and
the
galleries
winding
along
the
face
it
would
have
disheartened
us
to
gaze
up
the
hard
sheer
front
of
precipices
and
search
among
splintered
projections
crevices
shelves
and
for
an
inviting
route
had
we
not
been
animated
by
a
faith
that
the
mountains
could
not
defy
us
choosing
what
looked
like
the
least
impossible
way
we
started
but
finding
it
unsafe
to
work
with
packs
on
resumed
the
yesterday
s
plan
cotter
taking
the
lead
climbing
about
fifty
feet
ahead
and
hoisting
up
the
knapsacks
and
barometer
as
i
tied
them
to
the
end
of
the
lasso
constantly
closing
up
in
hopeless
difficulty
before
us
the
way
opened
again
and
again
to
our
gymnastics
until
we
stood
together
upon
a
mere
shelf
not
more
than
two
feet
wide
which
led
diagonally
up
the
smooth
cliff
edging
along
in
careful
steps
our
backs
flattened
upon
the
granite
we
moved
slowly
to
a
broad
platform
where
we
stopped
for
breath
there
was
no
foothold
above
us
looking
down
over
the
course
we
had
come
it
seemed
and
i
really
believe
it
was
an
impossible
descent
for
one
can
climb
upward
with
safety
where
he
can
not
downward
to
turn
back
was
to
give
up
in
defeat
and
we
sat
at
least
half
an
hour
suggesting
all
possible
routes
to
the
summit
accepting
none
and
feeling
disheartened
about
thirty
feet
directly
over
our
heads
was
another
shelf
which
if
we
could
reach
seemed
to
offer
at
least
a
temporary
way
upward
on
its
edge
were
two
or
three
spikes
of
granite
whether
firmly
connected
with
the
cliff
or
merely
blocks
of
we
could
not
tell
from
below
i
said
to
cotter
i
thought
of
but
one
possible
plan
it
was
to
lasso
one
of
these
blocks
and
to
climb
hand
over
hand
up
the
rope
in
the
lasso
i
had
perfect
confidence
for
i
had
seen
more
than
one
spanish
bull
throw
his
whole
weight
against
it
without
parting
a
strand
the
shelf
was
so
narrow
that
throwing
the
coil
of
rope
was
a
very
difficult
undertaking
i
tried
three
times
and
cotter
spent
five
minutes
vainly
whirling
the
loop
up
at
the
granite
spikes
at
last
i
made
a
lucky
throw
and
it
tightened
upon
one
of
the
smaller
protuberances
i
drew
the
noose
close
and
very
gradually
threw
my
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
upon
the
rope
then
cotter
joined
me
and
for
a
moment
we
both
hung
our
united
weight
upon
it
whether
the
rock
moved
slightly
or
whether
the
lasso
stretched
a
little
we
were
unable
to
decide
but
the
trial
must
be
made
and
i
began
to
climb
slowly
the
smooth
against
which
my
body
swung
offered
no
foothold
and
the
whole
climb
had
therefore
to
be
done
by
the
arms
an
effort
requiring
all
one
s
determination
when
about
half
way
up
i
was
obliged
to
rest
and
curling
my
feet
in
the
rope
managed
to
relieve
my
arms
for
a
moment
in
this
position
i
could
not
resist
the
fascinating
temptation
of
a
survey
downward
straight
down
nearly
a
thousand
feet
below
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
began
the
snow
whose
steep
slope
exaggerated
into
an
almost
vertical
angle
curved
down
in
a
long
white
field
broken
far
away
by
rocks
and
polished
round
lakes
of
ice
cotter
looked
up
cheerfully
and
asked
how
i
was
making
it
to
which
i
answered
that
i
had
plenty
of
wind
left
at
that
moment
when
hanging
between
heaven
and
earth
it
was
a
deep
satisfaction
to
look
down
at
the
wild
gulf
of
desolation
beneath
and
up
to
unknown
dangers
ahead
and
feel
my
nerves
cool
and
unshaken
a
few
pulls
hand
over
hand
brought
me
to
the
edge
of
the
shelf
when
throwing
an
arm
around
the
granite
spike
i
swung
my
body
upon
the
shelf
and
lay
down
to
rest
shouting
to
cotter
that
i
was
all
right
and
that
the
prospects
upward
were
capital
after
a
few
moments
breathing
i
looked
over
the
brink
and
directed
my
comrade
to
tie
the
barometer
to
the
lower
end
of
the
lasso
which
he
did
and
that
precious
instrument
was
hoisted
to
my
station
and
the
lasso
sent
down
twice
for
knapsacks
after
which
cotter
came
up
the
rope
in
his
very
muscular
way
without
once
stopping
to
rest
we
took
our
loads
in
our
hands
swinging
the
barometer
over
my
shoulder
and
climbed
up
a
shelf
which
led
in
a
zigzag
direction
upward
and
to
the
south
bringing
us
out
at
last
upon
the
thin
blade
of
a
ridge
which
connected
a
short
distance
above
with
the
summit
it
was
formed
of
huge
blocks
shattered
and
ready
at
a
touch
to
fall
so
narrow
and
sharp
was
the
upper
slope
that
we
dared
not
walk
but
got
astride
and
worked
slowly
along
with
our
hands
pushing
the
knapsacks
in
advance
now
and
then
holding
our
breath
when
loose
masses
rocked
under
our
weight
once
upon
the
summit
a
grand
view
burst
upon
us
hastening
to
step
upon
the
crest
of
the
divide
which
was
never
more
than
ten
feet
wide
frequently
sharpened
to
a
mere
blade
we
looked
down
the
other
side
and
were
astonished
to
find
we
had
ascended
the
gentler
slope
and
that
the
rocks
fell
from
our
feet
in
almost
vertical
precipices
for
a
thousand
feet
or
more
a
glance
along
the
summit
toward
the
highest
group
showed
us
that
any
advance
in
that
direction
was
impossible
for
the
thin
ridge
was
gashed
down
in
notches
three
or
four
hundred
feet
deep
forming
a
procession
of
pillars
obelisks
and
blocks
piled
upon
each
other
and
looking
terribly
insecure
we
then
deposited
our
knapsacks
in
a
safe
place
and
finding
that
it
was
already
noon
determined
to
rest
a
little
while
and
take
a
lunch
at
over
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
west
of
us
stretched
the
mount
brewer
wall
with
its
succession
of
smooth
precipices
and
amphitheatre
ridges
to
the
north
the
great
gorge
of
the
king
s
river
yawned
down
five
thousand
feet
to
the
south
the
valley
of
the
kern
opening
in
the
opposite
direction
was
broader
less
deep
but
more
filled
with
broken
masses
of
granite
clustered
about
the
foot
of
the
divide
were
a
dozen
alpine
lakes
the
higher
ones
blue
sheets
of
ice
the
lowest
completely
melted
still
lower
in
the
depths
of
the
two
cañons
we
could
see
groups
of
forest
trees
but
they
were
so
dim
and
so
distant
as
never
to
relieve
the
prevalent
masses
of
rock
and
snow
our
divide
cast
its
shadow
for
a
mile
down
king
s
cañon
in
dark
blue
profile
upon
the
broad
sheets
of
sunny
snow
from
whose
brightness
the
hard
splintered
cliffs
caught
reflections
and
wore
an
aspect
of
joy
thousands
of
rills
poured
from
the
melting
snow
filling
the
air
with
a
musical
tinkle
as
of
many
accordant
bells
the
kern
valley
opened
below
us
with
its
smooth
oval
outline
the
work
of
extinct
glaciers
whose
form
and
extent
were
evident
from
worn
and
rounded
wall
relics
of
the
former
hung
in
white
tapestries
around
its
ancient
birthplace
and
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
broad
corrugated
valley
for
a
breadth
of
fully
ten
miles
shone
with
burnishings
wherever
its
granite
surface
was
not
covered
with
lakelets
or
thickets
of
alpine
vegetation
through
a
deep
cut
in
the
mount
brewer
wall
we
gained
our
first
view
to
the
westward
and
saw
in
the
distance
the
wall
of
the
south
king
s
cañon
and
the
granite
point
which
cotter
and
i
had
climbed
a
fortnight
before
but
for
the
haze
we
might
have
seen
the
plain
for
above
its
farther
limit
were
several
points
of
the
coast
ranges
isolated
like
islands
in
the
sea
the
view
was
so
grand
the
mountain
colors
so
brilliant
immense
and
blue
alpine
lakes
so
charming
that
we
almost
forgot
we
were
ever
to
move
and
it
was
only
after
a
swift
hour
of
this
delight
that
we
began
to
consider
our
future
course
the
king
s
cañon
which
headed
against
our
wall
seemed
untraversable
no
human
being
could
climb
along
the
divide
we
had
then
but
one
hope
of
reaching
the
peak
and
our
greatest
difficulty
lay
at
the
start
if
we
could
climb
down
to
the
kern
side
of
the
divide
and
succeed
in
reaching
the
base
of
the
precipices
which
fell
from
our
feet
it
really
looked
as
if
we
might
travel
without
difficulty
among
the
to
the
other
side
of
the
kern
valley
and
make
our
attempt
upon
the
southward
flank
of
the
great
peak
one
look
at
the
sublime
white
giant
decided
us
we
looked
down
over
the
precipice
and
at
first
could
see
no
method
of
descent
then
we
went
back
and
looked
at
the
road
we
had
come
up
to
see
if
that
were
not
possibly
as
bad
but
the
broken
surface
of
the
rocks
was
evidently
much
better
than
anything
ahead
of
us
cotter
with
danger
edged
his
way
along
the
wall
to
the
east
and
i
to
the
west
to
see
if
there
might
not
be
some
favorable
point
but
we
both
returned
with
the
belief
that
the
precipice
in
front
of
us
was
as
passable
as
any
of
it
down
it
we
must
after
lying
on
our
faces
looking
over
the
brink
ten
or
twenty
minutes
i
suggested
that
by
lowering
ourselves
on
the
rope
we
might
climb
from
crevice
to
crevice
but
we
saw
no
shelf
large
enough
for
ourselves
and
the
knapsacks
too
however
we
were
not
going
to
give
it
up
without
a
trial
and
i
made
the
rope
fast
around
my
breast
and
looping
the
noose
over
a
firm
point
of
rock
let
myself
slide
gradually
down
to
a
notch
forty
feet
below
there
was
only
room
beside
me
for
cotter
so
i
made
him
send
down
the
knapsacks
first
i
then
tied
these
together
by
the
straps
with
my
silk
handkerchiefs
and
hung
them
off
as
far
to
the
left
as
i
could
reach
without
losing
my
balance
looping
the
handkerchiefs
over
a
point
of
rock
cotter
then
slid
down
the
rope
and
with
considerable
difficulty
we
whipped
the
noose
off
its
above
and
cut
off
our
connection
with
the
upper
world
we
re
in
for
it
now
king
remarked
my
comrade
as
he
looked
aloft
and
then
down
but
our
blood
was
up
and
danger
added
only
an
exhilarating
thrill
to
the
nerves
the
shelf
was
hardly
more
than
two
feet
wide
and
the
granite
so
smooth
that
we
could
find
no
place
to
fasten
the
lasso
for
the
next
descent
so
i
determined
to
try
the
climb
with
only
as
little
aid
as
possible
tying
it
around
my
breast
again
i
gave
the
other
end
into
cotter
s
hands
and
he
bracing
his
back
against
the
cliff
found
for
himself
as
firm
a
foothold
as
he
could
and
promised
to
give
me
all
the
help
in
his
power
i
made
up
my
mind
to
bear
no
weight
unless
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
for
the
first
ten
feet
i
found
cracks
and
protuberances
enough
to
support
me
making
every
square
inch
of
surface
do
friction
duty
and
hugging
myself
against
the
rocks
as
tightly
as
i
could
when
within
about
eight
feet
of
the
next
shelf
i
twisted
myself
round
upon
the
face
hanging
by
two
rough
blocks
of
protruding
feldspar
and
looked
vainly
for
some
further
but
the
rock
besides
being
perfectly
smooth
overhung
slightly
and
my
legs
dangled
in
the
air
i
saw
that
the
next
cleft
was
over
three
feet
broad
and
i
thought
possibly
i
might
by
a
quick
slide
reach
it
in
safety
without
endangering
cotter
i
shouted
to
him
to
be
very
careful
and
let
go
in
case
i
fell
loosened
my
hold
upon
the
rope
and
slid
quickly
down
my
shoulder
struck
against
the
rock
and
threw
me
out
of
balance
for
an
instant
i
reeled
over
upon
the
verge
in
danger
of
falling
but
in
the
excitement
i
thrust
out
my
hand
and
seized
a
small
alpine
the
first
piece
of
vegetation
we
had
seen
its
roots
were
so
firmly
fixed
in
the
crevice
that
it
held
my
weight
and
saved
me
i
could
no
longer
see
cotter
but
i
talked
to
him
and
heard
the
two
knapsacks
come
bumping
along
till
they
slid
over
the
eaves
above
me
and
swung
down
to
my
station
when
i
seized
the
lasso
s
end
and
braced
myself
as
well
as
possible
intending
if
he
slipped
to
haul
in
slack
and
help
him
as
best
i
might
as
he
came
slowly
down
from
crack
to
crack
i
heard
his
hobnailed
shoes
grating
on
the
granite
presently
they
appeared
dangling
from
the
eaves
above
my
head
i
had
gathered
in
the
rope
until
it
was
taut
and
then
hurriedly
told
him
to
drop
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
let
go
before
he
struck
the
rock
i
had
him
by
the
shoulder
and
whirled
him
down
upon
his
side
thus
preventing
his
rolling
overboard
which
friendly
action
he
took
quite
coolly
the
third
descent
was
not
a
difficult
one
nor
the
fourth
but
when
we
had
climbed
down
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
rocks
were
so
glacially
polished
and
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
get
any
farther
to
our
right
was
a
crack
penetrating
the
rock
perhaps
a
foot
deep
widening
at
the
surface
to
three
or
four
inches
which
proved
to
be
the
only
possible
ladder
as
the
chances
seemed
rather
desperate
we
concluded
to
tie
ourselves
together
in
order
to
share
a
common
fate
and
with
a
slack
of
thirty
feet
between
us
and
our
knapsacks
upon
our
backs
we
climbed
into
the
crevice
and
began
descending
with
our
faces
to
the
cliff
this
had
to
be
done
with
unusual
caution
for
the
foothold
was
about
as
good
as
none
and
our
fingers
slipped
annoyingly
on
the
smooth
stone
besides
the
knapsacks
and
instruments
kept
a
steady
backward
pull
tending
to
overbalance
us
but
we
took
pains
to
descend
one
at
a
time
and
rest
wherever
the
niches
gave
our
feet
a
safe
support
in
this
way
we
got
down
about
eighty
feet
of
smooth
nearly
vertical
wall
reaching
the
top
of
a
rude
granite
stairway
which
led
to
the
snow
and
here
we
sat
down
to
rest
and
found
to
our
astonishment
that
we
had
been
three
hours
from
the
summit
after
breathing
a
we
continued
down
jumping
from
rock
to
rock
and
having
by
practice
become
very
expert
in
balancing
ourselves
sprang
on
never
resting
long
enough
to
lose
the
and
in
this
manner
made
a
quick
descent
over
rugged
to
the
crest
of
a
which
for
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
more
swept
down
in
a
smooth
even
slope
of
very
high
angle
to
the
borders
of
a
frozen
lake
without
untying
the
lasso
which
bound
us
together
we
sprang
upon
the
snow
with
a
shout
and
glissaded
down
splendidly
turning
now
and
then
a
somersault
and
shooting
out
like
almost
to
the
middle
of
the
frozen
lake
i
upon
my
back
and
cotter
feet
first
in
a
swimming
position
the
ice
cracked
in
all
directions
it
was
only
a
thin
transparent
film
through
which
we
could
see
deep
into
the
lake
untying
ourselves
we
hurried
ashore
in
different
directions
lest
our
combined
weight
should
be
too
great
a
strain
upon
any
point
with
curiosity
and
wonder
we
scanned
every
shelf
and
niche
of
the
last
descent
it
seemed
quite
impossible
we
could
have
come
down
there
and
now
it
actually
was
beyond
human
power
to
get
back
again
but
what
cared
we
sufficient
unto
the
day
we
were
bound
for
that
still
distant
though
gradually
nearing
summit
and
we
had
come
from
a
cold
shadowed
cliff
into
deliciously
warm
sunshine
and
were
jolly
shouting
singing
songs
and
calling
out
the
companionship
of
a
hundred
echoes
six
miles
away
with
no
grave
danger
no
great
difficulty
between
us
lay
the
base
of
our
grand
mountain
upon
its
skirts
we
saw
a
little
grove
of
pines
an
ideal
bivouac
and
toward
this
we
bent
our
course
after
the
continued
climbing
of
the
day
walking
was
a
delicious
rest
and
forward
we
pressed
with
considerable
speed
our
hobnails
giving
us
firm
footing
on
the
glittering
glacial
surface
every
fluting
of
the
great
valley
was
in
itself
a
considerable
cañon
into
which
we
descended
climbing
down
the
scored
rocks
and
swinging
from
block
to
block
until
we
reached
the
level
of
the
pines
here
sheltered
among
began
to
appear
little
fields
of
alpine
grass
pale
yet
sunny
soft
under
our
feet
fragrantly
jewelled
with
flowers
of
fairy
delicacy
holding
up
amid
thickly
clustered
blades
chalices
of
turquoise
and
amethyst
white
stars
and
fiery
little
globes
of
red
lakelets
small
but
innumerable
were
held
in
glacial
basins
the
striæ
and
grooves
of
that
old
dragon
s
track
ornamenting
their
smooth
bottoms
one
of
these
a
sheet
of
pure
beryl
hue
gave
us
much
pleasure
from
its
lovely
transparency
and
because
we
lay
down
in
the
necklace
of
grass
about
it
and
smelled
flowers
while
tired
muscles
relaxed
upon
warm
beds
of
verdure
and
the
pain
in
our
burdened
shoulders
went
away
leaving
us
delightfully
comfortable
after
the
stern
grandeur
of
granite
and
ice
and
with
the
peaks
and
walls
still
in
view
it
was
relief
to
find
ourselves
again
in
the
region
of
life
i
never
felt
for
trees
and
flowers
such
a
sense
of
intimate
relationship
and
sympathy
when
we
had
no
longer
excuse
for
resting
i
invented
the
palpable
subterfuge
of
measuring
the
altitude
of
the
spot
since
the
few
clumps
of
low
pines
near
by
were
the
highest
living
trees
so
we
lay
longer
with
less
and
less
will
to
rise
and
when
resolution
called
us
to
our
feet
the
was
sorely
like
rip
van
winkle
s
in
the
third
act
the
deep
glacial
across
which
our
march
then
lay
proved
to
be
great
consumers
of
time
indeed
it
was
sunset
when
we
reached
the
eastern
ascent
and
began
to
toil
up
through
scattered
pines
and
over
trains
of
moraine
rocks
toward
the
great
peak
stars
were
already
flashing
brilliantly
in
the
sky
and
the
low
glowing
arch
in
the
west
had
almost
vanished
when
we
came
to
the
upper
trees
and
threw
down
our
knapsacks
to
camp
the
forest
grew
on
a
sort
of
with
a
precipitous
front
to
the
west
a
level
surface
which
stretched
eastward
and
back
to
the
foot
of
our
mountain
whose
lower
spurs
reached
within
a
mile
of
camp
within
the
shelter
lay
a
huge
fallen
log
like
all
these
alpine
woods
one
mass
of
resin
which
flared
up
when
we
applied
a
match
illuminating
the
whole
grove
by
contrast
with
the
darkness
outside
we
seemed
to
be
in
a
vast
hall
the
stream
close
by
afforded
water
for
our
blessed
teapot
venison
frizzled
with
mild
appetizing
sound
upon
the
ends
of
pine
sticks
matchless
beans
allowed
themselves
to
become
seductively
crisp
upon
our
tin
plates
that
supper
seemed
to
me
then
the
quintessence
of
gastronomy
and
i
am
sure
cotter
and
i
must
have
said
some
very
good
things
though
i
long
ago
forgot
them
all
within
the
ring
of
warmth
on
elastic
beds
of
we
curled
up
and
fell
swiftly
into
a
sound
sleep
i
woke
up
once
in
the
night
to
look
at
my
watch
and
observed
that
the
sky
was
overcast
with
a
thin
film
of
cirrus
cloud
to
which
the
reflected
moonlight
lent
the
appearance
of
a
glimmering
tent
stretched
from
mountain
to
mountain
over
cañons
filled
with
impenetrable
darkness
only
the
vaguely
lighted
peaks
and
white
distinctly
seen
i
closed
my
eyes
and
slept
soundly
until
cotter
woke
me
at
three
when
we
arose
breakfasted
by
the
light
of
our
fire
which
still
blazed
brilliantly
and
leaving
our
knapsacks
started
for
the
mountain
with
only
instruments
canteens
and
luncheon
in
the
indistinct
moonlight
climbing
was
very
difficult
at
first
for
we
had
to
thread
our
way
along
a
plain
which
was
literally
covered
with
glacier
bowlders
and
the
innumerable
brooks
which
we
crossed
were
frozen
solid
however
our
march
brought
us
to
the
base
of
the
great
mountain
which
rising
high
against
the
east
shut
out
the
coming
daylight
and
kept
us
in
profound
shadow
from
base
to
summit
rose
a
series
of
broken
crags
lifting
themselves
from
a
general
slope
of
toward
the
left
the
angle
seemed
to
be
rather
gentler
and
the
surface
less
ragged
and
we
hoped
by
a
long
round
the
base
to
make
an
easy
climb
up
this
gentler
face
so
we
toiled
on
for
an
hour
over
the
rocks
reaching
at
last
the
bottom
of
the
north
slope
here
our
work
began
in
good
earnest
the
blocks
were
of
enormous
size
and
in
every
stage
of
unstable
equilibrium
frequently
rolling
over
as
we
jumped
upon
them
making
it
necessary
for
us
to
take
a
second
leap
and
land
where
we
best
could
to
our
relief
we
soon
surmounted
the
largest
blocks
reaching
a
smaller
size
which
served
us
as
a
sort
of
stairway
the
advancing
daylight
revealed
to
us
a
very
long
comparatively
even
whose
surface
was
pierced
by
many
knobs
and
granite
heads
giving
it
the
aspect
of
an
fastened
on
with
bolts
of
stone
it
stretched
in
far
perspective
to
the
summit
where
already
the
rose
of
sunrise
reflected
gloriously
kindling
a
fresh
enthusiasm
within
us
immense
bowlders
were
partly
embedded
in
the
ice
just
above
us
whose
constant
melting
left
them
trembling
on
the
edge
of
a
fall
it
communicated
no
very
pleasant
sensation
to
see
above
you
these
immense
missiles
hanging
by
a
mere
band
knowing
that
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
you
would
be
exposed
to
a
constant
cannonade
the
east
side
of
the
peak
which
we
could
now
partially
see
was
too
precipitous
to
think
of
climbing
the
slope
toward
our
camp
was
too
much
broken
into
pinnacles
and
crags
to
offer
us
any
hope
or
to
divert
us
from
the
single
way
dead
ahead
up
slopes
of
ice
and
among
fragments
of
granite
the
sun
rose
upon
us
while
we
were
climbing
the
lower
part
of
this
snow
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
melting
began
to
liberate
huge
blocks
which
thundered
down
past
us
gathering
and
growing
into
small
avalanches
below
we
did
not
dare
climb
one
above
another
according
to
our
ordinary
mode
but
kept
about
an
equal
level
hundred
feet
apart
lest
dislodging
the
blocks
one
should
hurl
them
down
upon
the
other
we
climbed
up
smooth
faces
of
granite
clinging
simply
by
the
cracks
and
protruding
crystals
of
feldspar
and
then
hewed
steps
up
fearfully
steep
slopes
of
ice
zigzagging
to
the
right
and
left
to
avoid
the
flying
bowlders
when
midway
up
this
slope
we
reached
a
place
where
the
granite
rose
in
perfectly
smooth
bluffs
on
either
side
of
a
gorge
a
narrow
cut
or
walled
way
leading
up
to
the
flat
summit
of
the
cliff
this
we
scaled
by
cutting
ice
steps
only
to
find
ourselves
fronted
again
by
a
still
higher
wall
ice
sloped
from
its
front
at
too
steep
an
angle
for
us
to
follow
but
had
melted
in
contact
with
it
leaving
a
space
three
feet
wide
between
the
ice
and
the
rock
we
entered
this
crevice
and
climbed
along
its
bottom
with
a
wall
of
rock
rising
a
hundred
feet
above
us
on
one
side
and
a
face
of
ice
on
the
other
through
which
light
of
an
intense
penetrated
reaching
the
upper
end
we
had
to
cut
our
footsteps
upon
the
ice
again
and
having
braced
our
backs
against
the
granite
climbed
up
to
the
surface
we
were
now
in
a
dangerous
position
to
fall
into
the
crevice
upon
one
side
was
to
be
wedged
to
death
between
rock
and
ice
to
make
a
slip
was
to
be
shot
down
five
hundred
feet
and
then
hurled
over
the
brink
of
a
precipice
in
the
friendly
seat
which
this
wedge
gave
me
i
stopped
to
take
wet
and
dry
observations
with
the
thermometer
this
being
an
absolute
preventive
of
a
scare
and
to
enjoy
the
view
the
wall
of
our
mountain
sank
abruptly
to
the
left
opening
for
the
first
time
an
outlook
to
the
eastward
deep
it
seemed
almost
vertically
beneath
us
we
could
see
the
blue
water
of
owen
s
lake
ten
thousand
feet
down
the
summit
peaks
to
the
north
were
piled
in
titanic
confusion
their
ridges
overhanging
the
eastern
slope
with
terrible
abruptness
clustered
upon
the
shelves
and
plateaus
below
were
several
frozen
lakes
and
in
all
directions
swept
magnificent
fields
of
snow
the
summit
was
now
not
over
five
hundred
feet
distant
and
we
started
on
again
with
the
exhilarating
hope
of
success
but
if
nature
had
intended
to
secure
the
summit
from
all
assailants
she
could
not
have
planned
her
defences
better
for
the
smooth
granite
wall
which
rose
above
the
continued
apparently
quite
around
the
peak
and
we
looked
in
great
anxiety
to
see
if
there
was
not
one
place
where
it
might
be
climbed
it
was
all
blank
except
in
one
spot
quite
near
us
the
snow
bridged
across
the
crevice
and
rose
in
a
long
point
to
the
summit
of
the
wall
a
great
frozen
in
a
niche
of
the
bluff
its
base
about
ten
feet
wide
narrowing
to
two
feet
at
the
top
we
climbed
to
the
base
of
this
spire
of
ice
and
with
the
utmost
care
began
to
cut
our
stairway
the
material
was
an
exceedingly
compacted
snow
passing
into
clear
ice
as
it
neared
the
rock
we
climbed
the
first
half
of
it
with
comparative
ease
after
that
it
was
almost
vertical
and
so
thin
that
we
did
not
dare
to
cut
the
footsteps
deep
enough
to
make
them
absolutely
safe
there
was
a
constant
dread
lest
our
ladder
should
break
off
and
we
be
thrown
either
down
the
or
into
the
bottom
of
the
crevasse
at
last
in
order
to
prevent
myself
from
falling
over
backward
i
was
obliged
to
thrust
my
hand
into
the
crack
between
the
ice
and
the
wall
and
the
spire
became
so
narrow
that
i
could
do
this
on
both
sides
so
that
the
climb
was
made
as
upon
a
tree
cutting
mere
and
embracing
the
whole
column
of
ice
in
my
arms
at
last
i
reached
the
top
and
with
the
greatest
caution
wormed
my
body
over
the
brink
and
rolling
out
upon
the
smooth
surface
of
the
granite
looked
over
and
watched
cotter
make
his
climb
he
came
steadily
up
with
no
sense
of
nervousness
until
he
got
to
the
narrow
part
of
the
ice
and
here
he
stopped
and
looked
up
with
a
forlorn
face
to
me
but
as
he
climbed
up
over
the
edge
the
broad
smile
came
back
to
his
face
and
he
asked
me
if
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
we
had
by
and
by
to
go
down
again
we
had
now
an
easy
slope
to
the
summit
and
hurried
up
over
rocks
and
ice
reaching
the
crest
at
exactly
twelve
o
clock
i
rang
my
hammer
upon
the
topmost
rock
we
grasped
hands
and
i
reverently
named
the
grand
peak
mount
tyndall
iv
the
descent
of
mount
tyndall
to
our
surprise
upon
sweeping
the
horizon
with
my
level
there
appeared
two
peaks
equal
in
height
with
us
and
two
rising
even
higher
that
which
looked
highest
of
all
was
a
cleanly
cut
helmet
of
granite
upon
the
same
ridge
with
mount
tyndall
lying
about
six
miles
south
and
fronting
the
desert
with
a
bold
square
bluff
which
rises
to
the
crest
of
the
peak
where
a
white
fold
of
snow
trims
it
gracefully
mount
whitney
as
we
afterward
called
it
in
honor
of
our
chief
is
probably
the
highest
land
within
the
united
states
its
summit
looked
glorious
but
inaccessible
the
general
topography
overlooked
by
us
may
be
thus
simply
outlined
two
parallel
chains
enclosing
an
intermediate
trough
face
each
other
across
this
deep
enclosed
gulf
from
wall
to
wall
juts
the
thin
but
lofty
and
craggy
ridge
or
divide
before
described
which
forms
an
important
sending
those
streams
which
enter
the
chasm
north
of
it
into
king
s
river
those
south
forming
the
most
important
sources
of
the
kern
whose
straight
rapidly
deepening
valley
stretches
south
carved
profoundly
in
granite
while
the
king

flowing
longitudinally
in
the
opposite
course
for
eight
or
ten
miles
turns
abruptly
west
round
the
base
of

across
the
western
ridge
opening
a
gate
of
its
own
and
carves
a
rock
channel
transversely
down
the
sierra
to
the
california
plain
fronting
us
stood
the
west
chain
a
great
mural
ridge
watched
over
by
two
dominant
heights
kaweah
peak
and
mount
brewer
its
wonderful
profile
defining
against
the
western
sky
a
multitude
of
peaks
and
spires
bold
buttresses
jut
out
through
fields
of
ice
and
reach
down
stone
arms
among
snow
and
north
and
south
of
us
the
higher
or
eastern
summit
stretched
on
in
miles
and
miles
of
snow
peaks
the
farthest
horizon
still
crowded
with
their
white
points
east
the
whole
range
fell
in
sharp
hurrying
abruptness
to
the
desert
where
ten
thousand
feet
below
lay
a
vast
expanse
of
arid
plain
intersected
by
low
parallel
ranges
traced
from
north
to
south
upon
the
one
side
a
thousand
sculptures
of
stone
hard
sharp
shattered
by
cold
into
infiniteness
of
fractures
and
rift
springing
up
mutely
severe
into
the
dark
austere
blue
of
heaven
scarred
and
marked
except
where
snow
or
ice
spiked
down
by
ragged
granite
bolts
shields
with
its
pale
armor
these
rough
mountain
shoulders
at

and
dark
where
swooping
down
from
ragged
cliff
the
rocks
plunge
over
into
blue
silent
gulfs
upon
the
other
hand
reaching
out
to
horizons
faint
and
remote
lay
plains
clouded
with
the
ashen
hues
of
death
stark
floors
of
white
and
rigidly
formal
monotonously
low
all
lying
under
an
unfeeling
brilliance
of
light
which
for
all
its
strange
unclouded
clearness
has
yet
a
vague
a
suggestion
of
black
and
shade
more
truly
pathetic
than
fading
twilight
no
greenness
soothes
no
shadow
cools
the
glare
owen

an
oval
of
acrid
water
lies
dense
blue
upon
the
brown
looking
like
a
plate
of
hot
metal
traced
in
ancient
here
and
there
upon
hill
and
plain
relics
of
ancient
outline
the
memory
of
a
cooler
past
a
period
of
life
and
verdure
when
the
stony
chains
were
green
islands
among
basins
of
wide
watery
expanse
the
two
halves
of
this
view
both
in
sight
at
once
express
the
highest
the
most
acute
aspects
of
desolation
inanimate
forms
out
of
which

has
gone
forever
from
the
desert
have
been
dried
up
and
blown
away
its
seas
their
shores
and
white
bottoms
lie
there
in
the
eloquence
of
death
sharp
white
light
glances
from
all
the
where
in
marks
and
polishings
has
been
written
the
epitaph
of
glaciers
now
melted
and
vanished
into
air
vacant
cañons
lie
open
to
the
sun
bare
treeless
half
shrouded
with
snow
cumbered
with
loads
of
broken
still
as
graves
except
when
flights
of
rocks
rush
down
some
chasm
s
throat
startling
the
mountains
with
harsh
dry
rattle
their
fainter
echoes
from
below
followed
too
quickly
by
dense
silence
the
serene
sky
is
grave
with
nocturnal
darkness
the
earth
blinds
you
with
its
light
that
fair
contrast
we
love
in
lower
lands
between
bright
heavens
and
dark
cool
earth
here
reverses
itself
with
terrible
energy
you
look
up
into
an
infinite
vault
unveiled
by
clouds
empty
and
dark
from
which
no
brightness
seems
to
ray
an
expanse
with
no
graded
perspective
no
tremble
no
vapory
mobility
only
the
vast
yawning
of
hollow
space
with
an
aspect
of
endless
remoteness
burns
the
small
white
sun
yet
its
light
seems
to
pass
invisibly
through
the
sky
blazing
out
with
intensity
upon
mountain
and
plain
flooding
rock
details
with
painfully
bright
reflections
and
lighting
up
the
burnt
sand
and
stone
of
the
desert
with
a
strange
blinding
glare
there
is
no
sentiment
of
beauty
in
the
whole
scene
no
suggestion
however
far
remote
of
sheltered
landscape
not
even
the
air
of
virgin
hospitality
that
greets
us
explorers
in
so
many
uninhabited
spots
which
by
their
fertility
and
loveliness
of
grove
or
meadow
seem
to
offer
man
a
home
or
us
nomads
a
pleasant
silence
and
desolation
are
the
themes
which
nature
has
wrought
out
under
this
eternally
serious
sky
a
faint
suggestion
of
life
clings
about
the
middle
altitudes
of
the
eastern
slope
where
black
companies
of
pine
stunted
from
breathing
the
hot
desert
air
group
themselves
just
beneath
the
bottom
of
perpetual
snow
or
grow
in
patches
of
cloudy
darkness
over
the
moraines
those
piles
of
wreck
crowded
from
their
pathway
by
glaciers
long
dead
something
there
is
pathetic
in
the
very
emptiness
of
these
old
glacier
valleys
these
imperishable
tracks
of
unseen
engines
one
s
eye
ranges
up
their
broad
open
channel
to
the
shrunken
white
fields
surrounding
hollow
amphitheatres
which
were
once
crowded
with
deep
burdens
of
snow
the
birthplace
of
rivers
of
ice
now
wholly
melted
the
dry
clear
heavens
overhead
blank
of
any
promise
of
ever
rebuilding
them
i
have
never
seen
nature
when
she
seemed
so
little
mother
nature
as
in
this
place
of
rocks
and
snow
echoes
and
emptiness
it
impresses
me
as
the
ruins
of
some
bygone
geological
period
and
no
part
of
the
present
order
like
a
specimen
of
chaos
which
has
defied
the
finishing
hand
of
time
of
course
i
see
its
bearings
upon
climate
and
could
read
a
lesson
quite
glibly
as
to
its
usefulness
as
a
condenser
and
tell
you
gravely
how
much
california
has
for
which
she
may
thank
these
heights
and
how
little
nevada
but
looking
from
this
summit
with
all
desire
to
see
everything
the
one
overmastering
feeling
is
desolation
desolation
next
to
this
and
more
pleasing
to
notice
is
the
interest
and
richness
of
the
granite
forms
for
the
whole
region
from
plain
to
plain
is
built
of
this
dense
solid
rock
and
is
sculptured
under
chisel
of
cold
in
shapes
of
great
variety
yet
all
having
a
common
spirit
which
is
purely
gothic
in
the
much
discussed
origin
of
this
order
of
building
i
never
remember
to
have
seen
though
it
can
hardly
have
escaped
mention
any
suggestion
of
the
possibility
of
the
gothic
having
been
inspired
by
granite
forms
yet
as
i
sat
on
mount
tyndall
the
whole
mountains
shaped
themselves
like
the
ruins
of
cathedrals
sharp
pinnacled
and
statued
buttresses
more
spired
and
ornamented
than
milan
s
receding
doorways
with
pointed
arches
carved
into
black
façades
of
granite
doors
never
to
be
opened
innumerable
jutting
points
with
here
and
there
a
single
cruciform
peak
its
frozen
roof
and
granite
spires
so
strikingly
gothic
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
alps
furnished
the
models
for
early
cathedrals
of
that
order
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
silence
which
gratefully
contrasting
with
the
surrounding
tumult
of
form
conveyed
to
me
a
new
sentiment
i
have
lain
and
listened
through
the
heavy
calm
of
a
tropical
voyage
hour
after
hour
longing
for
a
sound
and
in
desert
nights
the
dead
stillness
has
many
a
time
awakened
me
from
sleep
for
moments
too
in
my
forest
life
the
groves
made
absolutely
no
breath
of
movement
but
there
is
around
these
summits
the
soundlessness
of
a
vacuum
the
sea
stillness
is
that
of
sleep
the
desert
of
death
this
silence
is
like
the
waveless
calm
of
space
all
the
while
i
made
my
instrumental
observations
the
fascination
of
the
view
so
held
me
that
i
felt
no
surprise
at
seeing
water
boiling
over
our
little
faggot
blaze
at
a
temperature
of
one
hundred
and
degrees
nor
in
observing
the
barometrical
column
stand
at
inches
and
it
was
not
till
a
week
or
so
after
that
i
realized
we
had
felt
none
of
the
conventional
sensations
of
nausea
headache
and
i
don
t
know
what
all
that
people
are
supposed
to
suffer
at
extreme
altitudes
but
these
things
go
with
guides
and
porters
i
believe
and
with
coming
down
to
one
s
hotel
at
evening
there
to
scold
one
s
picturesque
in
a
french
which
strikes
upon
his
ear
as
a
foreign
tongue
possibly
all
that
will
come
to
us
with
advancing
time
and
what
is
known
as
doing
they
are
already
shooting
our
buffaloes
it
can
not
be
long
before
they
will
cause
themselves
to
be
honorably
dragged
up
and
down
our
sierras
with
perennial
yellow
gaiter
and
ostentation
of
having
completed
our
observations
we
packed
up
the
instruments
glanced
once
again
round
the
whole
field
of
view
and
descended
to
the
top
of
our
icicle
ladder
upon
looking
over
i
saw
to
my
consternation
that
during
the
day
the
upper
half
had
broken
off
scars
traced
down
upon
the
below
it
indicated
the
manner
of
its
fall
and
far
below
upon
the
shattered
were
strewn
its
white
relics
i
saw
that
nothing
but
the
sudden
gift
of
wings
could
possibly
take
us
down
to
the
we
held
council
and
concluded
to
climb
quite
round
the
peak
in
search
of
the
best
mode
of
descent
as
we
crept
about
the
east
face
we
could
look
straight
down
upon
owen
s
valley
and
into
the
vast
glacier
gorges
and
over
piles
of
moraines
and
fluted
rocks
and
the
frozen
lakes
of
the
eastern
slope
when
we
reached
the
southwest
front
of
the
mountain
we
found
that
its
general
form
was
that
of
an
immense
horseshoe
the
great
eastern
ridge
forming
one
side
and
the
spur
which
descended
to
our
camp
the
other
we
having
climbed
up
the
outer
part
of
the
toe
within
the
curve
of
the
horseshoe
was
a
gorge
cut
almost
perpendicularly
down
two
thousand
feet
its
side
walls
of
rocks
and
snow
its
narrow
bottom
almost
a
continuous
chain
of
deep
blue
lakes
with
loads
of
ice
and
piles
the
stream
which
flowed
through
them
joined
the
waters
from
our
home
grove
a
couple
of
miles
below
the
camp
if
we
could
reach
the
level
of
the
lakes
i
believed
we
might
easily
climb
round
them
and
out
of
the
upper
end
of
the
horseshoe
and
walk
upon
the
kern
plateau
round
to
our
bivouac
it
required
a
couple
of
hours
of
very
painstaking
deliberate
climbing
to
get
down
the
first
descent
which
we
did
however
without
hurting
our
barometer
and
fortunately
without
the
fatiguing
use
of
the
lasso
reaching
finally
the
uppermost
lake
a
granite
bowlful
of
water
transparent
and
unrippled
so
high
and
enclosing
were
the
tall
walls
about
us
so
narrow
and
shut
in
the
cañon
so
flattened
seemed
the
cover
of
sky
we
felt
oppressed
after
the
expanse
and
freedom
of
our
hours
on
the
summit
the
we
followed
descending
farther
was
irregularly
honeycombed
in
deep
pits
circular
or
irregular
in
form
and
melted
to
a
greater
or
less
depth
holding
each
a
large
stone
embedded
in
the
bottom
it
seems
they
must
have
fallen
from
the
overhanging
heights
with
sufficient
force
to
plunge
into
the
snow
brilliant
light
and
strong
color
met
our
eyes
at
every
glance
the
rocks
of
a
deep
tint
the
pure
alpine
lakes
of
a
cheerful
sapphire
blue
the
snow
glitteringly
white
the
walls
on
either
side
for
half
their
height
were
planed
and
polished
by
glaciers
and
from
the
smoothly
glazed
sides
the
sun
was
reflected
as
from
a
mirror
mile
after
mile
we
walked
cautiously
over
the
snow
and
climbed
round
the
margins
of
lakes
and
over
piles
of
which
marked
the
ancient
terminal
moraines
at
length
we
reached
the
end
of
the
horseshoe
where
the
walls
contracted
to
a
gateway
rising
on
either
side
in
immense
vertical
pillars
a
thousand
feet
high
through
this
gateway
we
could
look
down
the
valley
of
the
kern
and
beyond
to
the
gentler
ridges
where
a
smooth
growth
of
forest
darkened
the
rolling
plateau
passing
the
last
snow
we
walked
through
this
gateway
and
turned
westward
round
the
spur
toward
our
camp
the
three
miles
which
closed
our
walk
were
alternately
through
groves
of
and
upon
plains
of
granite
the
glacier
sculpture
and
planing
are
here
very
beautiful
the
large
crystals
of
orthoclase
with
which
the
granite
is
studded
being
cut
down
to
the
common
level
their
rosy
tint
making
with
the
white
base
a
beautiful
burnished
porphyry
the
sun
was
still
an
hour
high
when
we
reached
camp
and
with
a
feeling
of
relaxation
and
repose
we
threw
ourselves
down
to
rest
by
the
log
which
still
continued
blazing
we
had
accomplished
our
purpose
during
the
last
hour
or
two
of
our
tramp
cotter
had
complained
of
his
shoes
which
were
rapidly
going
to
pieces
upon
examination
we
found
to
our
dismay
that
there
was
not
over
half
a
day
s
wear
left
in
them
a
calamity
which
gave
to
our
difficult
homeward
climb
a
new
element
of
danger
the
last
nail
had
been
worn
from
my
own
shoes
and
the
soles
were
scratched
to
the
quick
but
i
believed
them
stout
enough
to
hold
together
till
we
should
reach
the
main
camp
we
planned
a
pair
of
moccasins
for
cotter
and
then
spent
a
pleasant
evening
by
the
rehearsing
our
climb
to
the
detail
sleep
finally
overtaking
us
and
holding
us
fast
bound
until
broad
daylight
next
morning
when
we
woke
with
a
sense
of
having
slept
for
a
week
quite
bright
and
perfectly
refreshed
for
our
homeward
journey
after
a
frugal
breakfast
in
which
we
limited
ourselves
to
a
few
cubic
inches
of
venison
and
a
couple
of
stingy
slices
of
bread
with
a
single
meagre
cup
of
diluted
tea
we
shouldered
our
knapsacks
which
now
sat
lightly
upon
toughened
shoulders
and
marched
out
upon
the
granite
plateau
we
had
concluded
that
it
was
impossible
to
retrace
our
former
way
knowing
well
that
the
precipitous
divide
could
not
be
climbed
from
this
side
then
too
we
had
gained
such
confidence
in
our
climbing
powers
from
constant
victory
that
we
concluded
to
attempt
the
passage
of
the
great
king
s
cañon
mainly
because
this
was
the
only
mode
of
reaching
camp
and
since
the
geological
section
of
the
granite
it
exposed
would
afford
us
an
exceedingly
instructive
study
the
broad
granite
plateau
which
forms
the
upper
region
of
the
kern
valley
slopes
in
general
inclination
up
to
the
great
divide
this
remarkably
pinnacled
ridge
where
it
approaches
the
mount
tyndall
wall
breaks
down
into
a
broad
depression
where
the
kern
valley
sweeps
northward
until
it
suddenly
breaks
off
in
precipices
three
thousand
feet
down
into
the
king
s
cañon
the
morning
was
wholly
consumed
in
walking
up
this
gently
inclined
plane
of
granite
our
way
leading
over
the
foldings
and
along
graded
undulations
among
labyrinths
of
alpine
garden
and
wildernesses
of
erratic
bowlders
little
and
scattered
clusters
of
dwarfed
and
sombre
pine
about
noon
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
which
sank
sharply
from
our
feet
into
the
gulf
of
the
king
s
cañon
directly
opposite
us
rose
mount
brewer
and
up
out
of
the
depths
of
those
vast
sheets
of
frozen
snow
swept
spiry
dividing
the
upper
heights
into
those
amphitheatres
over
which
we
had
struggled
on
our
outward
journey
straight
across
from
our
point
of
view
was
the
chamber
of
rock
and
ice
where
we
had
camped
on
the
first
night
the
wall
at
our
feet
fell
sharp
and
rugged
its
lower
hidden
from
our
view
by
the
projections
of
a
thousand
feet
of
crags
here
and
there
as
we
looked
down
small
patches
of
ice
held
in
rough
hollows
rested
upon
the
steep
surface
but
it
was
too
abrupt
for
any
great
fields
of
snow
i
dislodged
a
bowlder
upon
the
edge
and
watched
it
bound
down
the
rocky
precipice
dash
over
eaves
a
thousand
feet
below
us
and
disappear
the
crash
of
its
fall
coming
up
to
us
from
the
unseen
depths
fainter
and
fainter
until
the
air
only
trembled
with
confused
echoes
a
long
look
at
the
pass
to
the
south
of
mount
brewer
where
we
had
parted
from
our
friends
animated
us
with
courage
to
begin
the
descent
which
we
did
with
utmost
care
for
the
rocks
becoming
more
and
more
afforded
us
hardly
any
firm
footholds
when
down
about
eight
hundred
feet
we
again
rolled
rocks
ahead
of
us
and
saw
them
disappear
over
the
eaves
and
only
heard
the
sound
of
their
stroke
after
many
seconds
which
convinced
us
that
directly
below
lay
a
great
precipice
at
this
juncture
the
soles
came
entirely
off
cotter
s
shoes
and
we
stopped
upon
a
little
cliff
of
granite
to
make
him
moccasins
of
our
provision
bags
and
slips
of
blanket
tying
them
on
as
firmly
as
we
could
with
the
extra
straps
and
buckskin
thongs
climbing
with
these
proved
so
insecure
that
i
made
cotter
go
behind
me
knowing
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
could
stop
him
if
he
fell
here
and
there
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
grew
stunted
pine
bushes
their
roots
twisted
so
firmly
into
the
crevices
that
we
laid
hold
of
them
with
the
utmost
confidence
whenever
they
came
within
our
reach
in
this
way
we
descended
to
within
fifty
feet
of
the
brink
having
as
yet
no
knowledge
of
the
cliffs
below
except
our
general
memory
of
their
aspect
from
the
mount
brewer
wall
the
rock
was
so
steep
that
we
descended
in
a
sitting
posture
clinging
with
our
hands
and
heels
i
heard
cotter
say
i
think
i
must
take
off
these
moccasins
and
try
it
barefooted
for
i
don
t
believe
i
can
make
these
words
were
instantly
followed
by
a
startled
cry
and
i
looked
round
to
see
him
slide
quickly
toward
me
struggling
and
clutching
at
the
smooth
granite
as
he
slid
by
i
made
a
grab
for
him
with
my
right
hand
catching
him
by
the
shirt
and
throwing
myself
as
far
in
the
other
direction
as
i
could
seized
with
my
left
hand
a
little
pine
tuft
which
held
us
i
asked
cotter
to
edge
along
a
little
to
the
left
where
he
could
get
a
brace
with
his
feet
and
relieve
me
of
his
weight
which
he
cautiously
did
i
then
threw
a
couple
of
turns
with
the
lasso
round
the
roots
of
the
pine
bush
and
we
were
safe
though
hardly
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
brink
the
pressure
of
curiosity
to
get
a
look
over
that
edge
was
so
strong
within
me
that
i
lengthened
out
sufficient
lasso
to
reach
the
end
and
slid
slowly
to
the
edge
where
leaning
over
i
looked
down
getting
a
full
view
of
the
wall
for
miles
directly
beneath
a
sheer
cliff
of
three
or
four
hundred
feet
stretched
down
to
a
pile
of
which
rose
to
unequal
heights
along
its
face
reaching
the
very
crest
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
south
of
us
from
that
point
to
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
broken
rocks
ridges
rising
through
vast
sweeps
of
tufts
of
pine
and
frozen
bodies
of
ice
covered
the
further
slope
i
returned
to
cotter
and
having
loosened
ourselves
from
the
pine
bush
inch
by
inch
we
crept
along
the
granite
until
we
supposed
ourselves
to
be
just
over
the
top
of
the
pile
where
i
found
a
firm
brace
for
my
feet
and
lowered
cotter
to
the
edge
he
sang
out
all
right
and
climbed
over
on
the
uppermost
his
head
only
remaining
in
sight
of
me
when
i
lay
down
upon
my
back
making
knapsack
and
body
do
friction
duty
and
letting
myself
move
followed
cotter
and
reached
his
side
from
that
point
the
descent
required
two
hours
of
severe
constant
labor
which
was
monotonous
of
itself
and
would
have
proved
excessively
tiresome
but
for
the
constant
interest
of
glacial
geology
beneath
us
when
at
last
we
reached
the
bottom
and
found
ourselves
upon
a
velvety
green
meadow
beneath
the
shadow
of
pines
we
realized
the
amount
of
muscular
force
we
had
used
up
and
threw
ourselves
down
for
a
rest
of
half
an
hour
when
we
rose
not
quite
renewed
but
fresh
enough
to
finish
the
day
s
climb
in
a
few
minutes
we
stood
upon
the
rocks
just
above
king
s
river
a
broad
white
torrent
fretting
its
way
along
the
bottom
of
an
impassable
gorge
looking
down
the
stream
we
saw
that
our
right
bank
was
a
continued
precipice
affording
so
far
as
we
could
see
no
possible
descent
to
the
river
s
margin
and
indeed
had
we
gotten
down
the
torrent
rushed
with
such
fury
that
we
could
not
possibly
have
crossed
it
to
the
south
of
us
a
little
way
up
stream
the
river
flowed
out
from
a
broad
oval
lake
three
quarters
of
a
mile
in
length
which
occupied
the
bottom
of
the
granite
basin
unable
to
cross
the
torrent
we
must
either
swim
the
lake
or
climb
round
its
head
upon
our
side
the
walls
of
the
basin
curved
to
the
head
of
the
lake
in
sharp
smooth
precipices
or
broken
slopes
of
while
on
the
opposite
side
its
margin
was
a
beautiful
shore
of
emerald
meadow
edged
with
a
continuous
grove
of
coniferous
trees
once
upon
this
other
side
we
should
have
completed
the
severe
part
of
our
journey
crossed
the
gulf
and
have
left
all
danger
behind
us
for
the
long
slope
of
granite
and
ice
which
rose
upon
the
west
side
of
the
cañon
and
the
mount
brewer
wall
opposed
to
us
no
trials
save
those
of
simple
fatigue
around
the
head
of
the
lake
were
crags
and
precipices
in
singularly
forbidding
arrangement
as
we
turned
thither
we
saw
no
possible
way
of
overcoming
them
at
its
head
the
lake
lay
in
an
angle
of
the
vertical
wall
sharp
and
straight
like
the
corner
of
a
room
about
three
hundred
feet
in
height
and
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
this
a
pyramidal
pile
of
blue
ice
rose
from
the
lake
rested
against
the
corner
and
reached
within
forty
feet
of
the
top
looking
into
the
deep
blue
water
of
the
lake
i
concluded
that
in
our
exhausted
state
it
was
madness
to
attempt
to
swim
it
the
only
alternative
was
to
scale
that
slender
pyramid
of
ice
and
find
some
way
to
climb
the
forty
feet
of
smooth
wall
above
it
a
plan
we
chose
perforce
and
started
at
once
to
put
into
execution
determined
that
if
we
were
unsuccessful
we
would
fire
a
dead
log
which
lay
near
warm
ourselves
thoroughly
and
attempt
the
swim
at
its
base
the
ice
mass
overhung
the
lake
like
a
roof
under
which
the
water
had
melted
its
way
for
a
distance
of
not
less
than
a
hundred
feet
a
thin
eave
overhanging
the
water
to
the
very
edge
of
this
i
cautiously
went
and
looking
down
into
the
lake
saw
through
its
beryl
depths
the
white
granite
blocks
strewn
upon
the
bottom
at
least
one
hundred
feet
below
me
it
was
exceedingly
transparent
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
a
most
tempting
place
for
a
dive
but
at
the
end
of
our
long
fatigue
and
with
the
still
unknown
tasks
ahead
i
shrank
from
a
swim
in
such
a
chilly
temperature
we
found
the
difficultly
steep
but
made
our
way
successfully
along
its
edge
clambering
up
the
crevices
melted
between
its
body
and
the
smooth
granite
to
a
point
not
far
from
the
top
where
the
ice
had
considerably
narrowed
and
rocks
overhanging
it
encroached
so
closely
that
we
were
obliged
to
change
our
course
and
make
our
way
with
cut
steps
out
upon
its
front
streams
of
water
dropping
from
the
overhanging
at
many
points
had
worn
circular
shafts
into
the
ice
three
feet
in
diameter
and
twenty
feet
in
depth
their
edges
offered
us
our
only
foothold
and
we
climbed
from
one
to
another
equally
careful
of
slipping
upon
the
slope
itself
or
falling
into
the
wells
upon
the
top
of
the
ice
we
found
a
narrow
level
platform
upon
which
we
stood
together
resting
our
backs
in
the
granite
corner
and
looked
down
the
awful
pathway
of
king
s
cañon
until
the
rest
nerved
us
up
enough
to
turn
our
eyes
upward
at
the
forty
feet
of
smooth
granite
which
lay
between
us
and
safety
here
and
there
were
small
projections
from
its
surface
little
protruding
knobs
of
feldspar
and
crevices
riven
into
its
face
for
a
few
inches
as
we
tied
ourselves
together
i
told
cotter
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
jump
down
into
one
of
these
in
case
i
fell
and
started
to
climb
up
the
wall
succeeding
quite
well
for
about
twenty
feet
about
two
feet
above
my
hands
was
a
crack
which
if
my
arms
had
been
long
enough
to
reach
would
probably
have
led
me
to
the
very
top
but
i
judged
it
beyond
my
powers
and
with
great
care
descended
to
the
side
of
cotter
who
believed
that
his
superior
length
of
arm
would
enable
him
to
make
the
reach
i
planted
myself
against
the
rock
and
he
started
cautiously
up
the
wall
looking
down
the
glare
front
of
ice
it
was
not
pleasant
to
consider
at
what
velocity
a
slip
would
send
me
to
the
bottom
or
at
what
angle
and
to
what
probable
depth
i
should
be
projected
into
the
indeed
the
idea
of
such
a
sudden
bath
was
so
annoying
that
i
lifted
my
eyes
toward
my
companion
he
reached
my
farthest
point
without
great
difficulty
and
made
a
bold
spring
for
the
crack
reaching
it
without
an
inch
to
spare
and
holding
on
wholly
by
his
fingers
he
thus
worked
himself
slowly
along
the
crack
toward
the
top
at
last
getting
his
arms
over
the
brink
and
gradually
drawing
his
body
up
and
out
of
sight
it
was
the
most
splendid
piece
of
slow
gymnastics
i
ever
witnessed
for
a
moment
he
said
nothing
but
when
i
asked
if
he
was
all
right
cheerfully
repeated
all
it
was
only
a
moment
s
work
to
send
up
the
two
knapsacks
and
barometer
and
receive
again
my
end
of
the
lasso
as
i
tied
it
round
my
breast
cotter
said
to
me
in
an
easy
confident
tone
don
t
be
afraid
to
bear
your
i
made
up
my
mind
however
to
make
that
climb
without
his
aid
and
husbanded
my
strength
as
i
climbed
from
crack
to
crack
i
got
up
without
difficulty
to
my
former
point
rested
there
a
moment
hanging
solely
by
my
hands
gathered
every
pound
of
strength
and
atom
of
will
for
the
reach
then
jerked
myself
upward
with
a
swing
just
getting
the
tips
of
my
fingers
into
the
crack
in
an
instant
i
had
grasped
it
with
my
right
hand
also
i
felt
the
sinews
of
my
fingers
relax
a
little
but
the
picture
of
the
slope
of
ice
and
the
blue
lake
affected
me
so
strongly
that
i
redoubled
my
grip
and
climbed
slowly
along
the
crack
until
i
reached
the
angle
and
got
one
arm
over
the
edge
as
cotter
had
done
as
i
rested
my
body
upon
the
edge
and
looked
up
at
cotter
i
saw
that
instead
of
a
level
top
he
was
sitting
upon
a
smooth
slope
where
the
least
pull
would
have
dragged
him
over
the
brink
he
had
no
brace
for
his
feet
nor
hold
for
his
hands
but
had
seated
himself
calmly
with
the
rope
tied
around
his
breast
knowing
that
my
only
safety
lay
in
being
able
to
make
the
climb
entirely
unaided
certain
that
the
least
waver
in
his
tone
would
have
disheartened
me
and
perhaps
made
it
impossible
the
shock
i
received
on
seeing
this
affected
me
for
a
moment
but
not
enough
to
throw
me
off
my
guard
and
i
climbed
quickly
over
the
edge
when
we
had
walked
back
out
of
danger
we
sat
down
upon
the
granite
for
a
rest
in
all
my
experience
of
mountaineering
i
have
never
known
an
act
of
such
real
profound
courage
as
this
of
cotter
s
it
is
one
thing
in
a
moment
of
excitement
to
make
a
gallant
leap
or
hold
one
s
nerves
in
the
iron
grasp
of
will
but
to
coolly
seat
one
s
self
in
the
door
of
death
and
silently
listen
for
the
fatal
summons
and
this
all
for
a
friend
for
he
might
easily
have
cast
loose
the
lasso
and
saved
himself
requires
as
sublime
a
type
of
courage
as
i
know
but
a
few
steps
back
we
found
a
thicket
of
pine
overlooking
our
lake
by
which
there
flowed
a
clear
rill
of
here
in
the
bottom
of
the
great
gulf
we
made
our
bivouac
for
we
were
already
in
the
deep
evening
shadows
although
the
to
the
east
of
us
still
burned
in
the
reflected
light
it
was
the
luxury
of
repose
which
kept
me
awake
half
an
hour
or
so
in
spite
of
my
vain
attempts
at
sleep
to
listen
for
the
pulsating
sound
of
waterfalls
and
arrowy
rushing
of
the
brook
by
our
beds
was
too
deep
a
pleasure
to
quickly
yield
up
under
the
later
moonlight
i
rose
and
went
out
upon
the
open
rocks
allowing
myself
to
be
deeply
impressed
by
the
weird
dantesque
surroundings
darkness
out
of
which
to
the
sky
towered
stern
shaggy
bodies
of
rock
snow
uncertainly
moonlit
with
cold
pallor
and
at
my
feet
the
basin
of
the
lake
still
black
and
gemmed
with
reflected
stars
like
the
void
into
which
dante
looked
through
the
bottomless
gulf
of
dis
a
little
way
off
there
appeared
upon
the
brink
of
a
projecting
granite
cornice
two
dimly
seen
forms
pines
i
knew
them
to
be
yet
their
motionless
figures
seemed
bent
forward
gazing
down
the
cañon
and
i
allowed
myself
to
name
them
mantuan
and
florentine
thinking
at
the
same
time
how
grand
and
spacious
the
scenery
how
powerful
their
attitude
and
how
infinitely
more
profound
the
mystery
of
light
and
shade
than
any
of
those
hard
theatrical
conceptions
with
which
doré
has
sought
to
shut
in
our
imagination
that
artist
as
i
believe
has
reached
a
conspicuous
failure
from
an
overbalancing
love
of
solid
impenetrable
darkness
there
is
in
all
his
inferno
landscape
a
certain
sharp
boundary
between
the
real
and
unreal
and
never
the
infinite
suggestiveness
of
great
regions
of
in
which
everything
may
be
seen
nothing
recognized
without
waking
cotter
i
crept
back
to
my
blankets
and
to
sleep
the
morning
of
our
fifth
and
last
day
s
tramp
must
have
dawned
cheerfully
at
least
so
i
suppose
from
its
aspect
when
we
first
came
back
to
consciousness
surprised
to
find
the
sun
risen
from
the
eastern
and
the
whole
gorge
flooded
with
its
direct
light
rising
as
good
as
new
from
our
mattress
of
pine
twigs
we
hastened
to
take
breakfast
and
started
up
the
long
broken
slope
of
the
mount
brewer
wall
to
reach
the
pass
where
we
had
parted
from
our
friends
required
seven
hours
of
slow
laborious
climbing
in
which
we
took
advantage
of
every
outcropping
spine
of
granite
and
every
level
expanse
of
ice
to
hasten
at
the
top
of
our
speed
cotter
s
feet
were
severely
cut
his
tracks
upon
the
snow
were
marked
by
stains
of
blood
yet
he
kept
on
with
undiminished
spirit
never
once
complaining
the
perfect
success
of
our
journey
so
inspired
us
with
happiness
that
we
forgot
danger
and
fatigue
and
chatted
in
liveliest
strain
it
was
about
two
o
clock
when
we
reached
the
summit
and
rested
a
moment
to
look
back
over
our
new
alps
which
were
hard
and
distinct
under
direct
unpoetic
light
yet
with
all
their
dense
gray
and
white
reality
their
long
sculptured
ranks
and
cold
still
summits
we
gave
them
a
lingering
farewell
look
which
was
not
without
its
deep
fulness
of
emotion
then
turned
our
backs
and
hurried
down
the
slope
into
the
rocky
amphitheatre
at
the
foot
of
mount
brewer
and
by
five
o
clock
had
reached
our
old
we
found
here
a
note
pinned
to
a
tree
informing
us
that
the
party
had
gone
down
into
the
lower
cañon
five
miles
below
that
they
might
camp
in
better
pasturage
the
wind
had
scattered
the
ashes
of
our
old
and
banished
from
it
the
last
sentiment
of
home
we
hurried
on
climbing
among
the
rocks
which
reached
down
to
the
crest
of
the
great
lateral
moraine
and
then
on
in
rapid
stride
along
its
smooth
crest
riveting
our
eyes
upon
the
valley
below
where
we
knew
the
party
must
be
camped
at
last
faintly
curling
above
the
sea
of
green
a
few
faint
clouds
of
smoke
wafted
upward
into
the
air
we
saw
them
with
a
burst
of
strong
emotion
and
ran
down
the
steep
flank
of
the
moraine
at
the
top
of
our
speed
our
shouts
were
instantly
answered
by
the
three
voices
of
our
friends
who
welcomed
us
to
their
with
tremendous
hugs
after
we
had
outlined
for
them
the
experience
of
our
days
and
as
we
lay
outstretched
at
our
ease
warm
in
the
blaze
of
the
glorious
brewer
said
to
me
king
you
have
relieved
me
of
a
dreadful
task
for
the
last
three
days
i
have
been
composing
a
letter
to
your
family
but
somehow
i
did
not
get
beyond
it
becomes
my
painful
duty
to
inform
v
the
newtys
of
pike
our
return
from
mount
tyndall
to
such
civilization
as
flourishes
around
the
kaweah
outposts
was
signalized
by
us
chiefly
as
to
our
which
offered
now
such
bounties
as
the
potato
and
once
a
salad
in
which
some
lettuce
became
the
vehicle
for
a
hollow
mockery
of
dressing
two
or
three
days
during
which
we
dined
at
brief
intervals
served
to
completely
rest
us
and
put
in
excellent
trim
for
further
campaigning
all
except
professor
brewer
upon
whom
a
constant
toothache
wore
painfully
my
failing
even
upon
the
third
trial
to
extract
the
unruly
member
it
was
determined
we
should
ride
together
to
visalia
seventy
miles
away
and
the
farther
we
went
the
more
impatient
became
my
friend
till
we
agreed
to
push
ahead
through
day
and
night
and
reached
the
village
at
about
sunrise
in
a
state
of
reeling
sleepiness
quite
indescribably
funny
at
evening
when
it
became
time
to
start
back
for
our
my
friend
at
last
yielded
consent
to
my
project
of
climbing
the
kern
sierras
to
attempt
mount
whitney
so
i
parted
from
him
and
remaining
at
visalia
outfitted
myself
with
a
two
mounted
men
and
provisions
enough
for
a
two
weeks
trip
i
purposely
avoid
telling
by
what
route
i
entered
the
sierras
because
there
lingers
in
my
breast
a
desire
to
see
once
more
that
lovely
region
and
failing
as
i
do
to
confide
in
the
people
i
fear
lest
if
the
camp
i
am
going
to
describe
should
be
recognized
i
might
upon
revisiting
the
scene
suffer
harm
or
even
come
to
an
untimely
end
i
refrain
then
from
telling
by
what
road
i
found
myself
entering
the
region
of
the
pines
one
lovely
twilight
evening
two
days
after
leaving
visalia
pines
growing
closer
and
closer
from
sentinels
gathered
to
groups
then
stately
groves
and
at
last
as
the
evening
wore
on
assembled
in
regular
forest
through
whose
open
tops
the
stars
shone
cheerfully
i
came
upon
an
open
meadow
hearing
in
front
the
rush
of
a
large
brook
and
directly
reached
two
where
were
a
number
of
persons
my
two
hirelings
caught
and
unloaded
the
and
set
about
their
duties
looking
to
supper
and
the
animals
while
i
prospected
the
two
camps
that
just
below
me
on
the
same
side
of
the
brook
i
found
to
be
the
bivouac
of
a
company
of
hunters
who
in
the
ten
minutes
of
my
call
made
free
with
me
hospitably
offering
a
jug
of
whiskey
and
then
went
on
in
their
old
eternal
way
of
making
out
of
whole
cloth
i
left
them
with
a
belief
that
my
protoplasm
and
theirs
must
be
different
in
spite
of
huxley
and
passed
across
the
brook
to
the
other
camp
under
noble
groups
of
pines
smouldered
a
generous
heap
of
coals
the
ruins
of
a
mighty
log
a
little
way
from
this
lay
a
confused
pile
of
bedclothes
partly
old
and
but
in
the
main
thick
strata
of
what
is
known
to
irony
as
comforters
upon
which
outstretched
in
wretched
awkwardness
of
position
was
a
family
all
with
their
feet
to
the
fire
looking
as
if
they
had
been
blown
over
in
one
direction
or
knocked
down
by
a
single
bombshell
on
the
extremities
of
this
common
bed
with
the
air
of
having
gotten
as
far
from
each
other
as
possible
the
mother
and
father
of
the
pike
family
reclined
between
them
were
two
small
children
a
girl
and
a
boy
and
a
huge
girl
who
next
the
old
man
lay
flat
upon
her
back
her
mind
absorbed
in
the
simple
amusement
of
waving
one
foot
a
eleven
slowly
across
the
fire
squinting
with
eye
first
at
the
vast
shoe
and
thence
at
the
fire
alternately
hiding
bright
places
and
darting
the
foot
quickly
in
the
direction
of
any
new
display
of
heightening
flame
the
mother
was
a
bony
sister
in
the
yellow
shrunken
of
sharp
visage
in
which
were
prominent
two
cold
eyes
and
a
positively
poisonous
mouth
her
hair
the
color
of
faded
hay
tangled
in
a
jungle
around
her
head
she
rocked
jerkily
to
and
fro
removing
at
intervals
a
clay
pipe
from
her
mouth
in
order
to
pucker
her
thin
lips
up
to
one
side
and
spit
with
precision
upon
a
certain
spot
in
the
fire
which
she
seemed
resolved
to
prevent
from
attaining
beyond
a
certain
faint
glow
i
have
rarely
felt
more
in
difficulty
for
an
overture
to
conversation
and
was
long
before
venturing
to
propose
you
seem
to
have
a
pleasant
the
old
woman
sharply
and
in
almost
a
tone
of
affront
answered
they
s
wus
and
then
again
they
s
doos
well
for
our
hogs
inserted
the
old
man
we
ve
a
band
of
pork
that
make
out
to
find
oh
how
many
have
you
i
asked
nigh
three
won
t
you
set
asked
madame
then
turning
you
susan
can
t
you
try
for
to
set
up
and
not
spread
so
hain
t
you
no
manners
say
at
this
the
massive
girl
got
herself
somewhat
together
and
made
room
for
me
which
i
declined
however
prospectin
inquired
madame
i
say
huntin
suggested
the
man
maybe
he
s
a
interrupted
the
little
girl
goin
somewhere
ain
t
yer
was
susan
s
guess
i
gave
a
brief
account
of
myself
evidently
satisfying
the
social
requirements
of
all
but
the
old
woman
who
at
once
classified
me
as
not
up
to
her
standard
susan
saw
this
so
did
her
father
and
it
became
evident
to
me
in
ten
minutes
conversation
that
they
two
were
always
at
one
and
made
it
their
business
to
be
in
antagonism
to
the
mother
they
were
then
allies
of
mine
from
nature
and
i
felt
at
once
at
home
i
saw
too
that
susan
having
slid
back
to
her
horizontal
position
when
i
declined
to
share
her
rightful
ground
was
watching
with
subtle
solicitude
that
fated
spot
in
the
fire
opposing
sympathy
and
squints
accurately
aligned
by
her
shoe
to
the
dull
spot
in
the
embers
which
slowly
went
out
into
blackness
before
the
fire
of
her
mother
s
saliva
the
shouts
which
i
heard
proceeding
from
the
direction
of
my
camp
were
easily
translatable
into
summons
for
supper
newty
invited
me
to
return
later
and
be
sociable
which
i
promised
to
do
and
going
to
my
camp
supped
quickly
and
left
the
men
with
orders
about
picketing
the
animals
for
the
night
then
strolling
slowly
down
to
the
camp
of
my
friends
seated
myself
upon
a
log
by
the
side
of
the
old
gentleman
feeling
that
this
somewhat
formal
attitude
unfitted
me
for
partaking
to
the
fullest
degree
of
the
social
ease
around
me
and
knowing
that
my
buckskin
trousers
were
impervious
to
dirt
i
slid
down
in
a
reclined
posture
with
my
feet
to
the
fire
in
absolute
parallelism
with
the
family
the
old
woman
was
in
the
exciting
of
a
directed
to
her
little
boy
who
sat
clinging
to
her
skirt
and
looking
in
her
face
with
absorbed
curiosity
and
when
johnnie
fired
she
said
the
coon
fell
and
busted
the
little
boy
had
misplaced
his
sympathies
with
the
raccoon
and
having
inquired
plaintively
did
it
hurt
him
was
promptly
snubbed
with
the
reply
of
course
it
hurt
him
what
do
you
suppose
coons
is
made
for
then
turning
to
me
she
put
what
was
plainly
enough
with
her
a
i
allow
you
have
killed
your
coon
in
your
day
i
saw
at
once
that
i
must
forever
sink
beneath
the
horizon
of
her
standards
but
failing
in
real
experience
or
accurate
knowledge
concerning
the
coon
knew
no
subterfuges
would
work
with
her
instinct
had
taught
her
that
i
had
never
killed
a
coon
and
she
had
asked
me
thus
ostentatiously
to
place
me
at
once
and
forever
before
the
family
in
my
true
light
no
ma
am
i
said
now
you
speak
of
it
i
realize
that
i
never
have
killed
a
this
was
something
of
a
staggerer
to
susan
and
her
father
yet
as
the
mother
s
pleasurable
dissatisfaction
with
me
displayed
itself
by
more
and
more
accurate
salivary
shots
at
the
fire
they
rose
to
the
occasion
and
began
to
palliate
my
past
maybe
ventured
newty
that
they
don
t
have
coon
round
the
city
of
york
and
i
felt
that
i
needed
no
when
susan
firmly
and
defiantly
suggested
to
her
mother
that
perhaps
i
was
in
better
business
driven
in
upon
herself
for
some
time
the
old
woman
smoked
in
silence
until
susan
seeing
that
her
mother
gradually
quenched
a
larger
and
larger
circle
upon
the
fire
got
up
and
stretched
herself
and
giving
the
coals
a
vigorous
poke
swept
out
of
sight
the
quenched
spot
thus
readily
obliterating
the
result
of
her
mother
s
precise
and
prolonged
expectoration
then
flinging
a
few
dry
boughs
upon
the
fire
illumined
the
family
with
the
ruddy
blaze
and
sat
down
again
leaning
upon
her
father
s
knee
with
a
faint
light
of
triumph
in
her
eye
i
ventured
a
few
platitudes
concerning
pigs
not
penetrating
the
depths
of
that
branch
of
rural
science
enough
to
betray
my
ignorance
such
sentiments
as
a
little
piece
of
bacon
well
broiled
for
breakfast
is
very
good
and
nothing
better
than
cold
ham
for
lunch
were
received
by
susan
and
her
father
in
the
spirit
i
meant
of
entire
toward
pork
generically
i
now
look
back
in
amusement
at
having
fallen
into
this
weakness
for
the
mosaic
view
of
pork
has
been
mine
from
infancy
and
campaigning
upon
government
rations
has
in
truth
no
tendency
to
dim
this
ancient
faith
by
nine
the
gates
of
conversation
were
fairly
open
and
our
part
of
the
circle
enjoyed
itself
socially
taciturnity
and
clouds
of
virginia
plug
reigning
supreme
upon
the
other
the
two
little
children
crept
under
comforters
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
subsided
pleasantly
to
sleep
the
old
man
at
last
stretched
sleepily
finally
yawning
out
susan
i
do
believe
i
am
too
tired
out
to
go
and
see
if
them
corral
bars
are
down
i
guess
you
ll
have
to
go
i
reckon
there
ain
t
no
bears
round
susan
rose
to
her
feet
stretched
herself
with
her
back
to
the
fire
and
i
realized
for
the
first
time
her
amusing
proportions
in
the
region
of
six
feet
tall
of
firm
iron
back
and
heavy
mould
of
limb
she
yet
possessed
that
suppleness
which
enabled
her
as
she
rose
to
throw
herself
into
nearly
all
the
attitudes
of
the
niobe
children
as
her
yawn
deepened
she
waved
nearly
down
to
the
ground
and
then
rising
upon
tiptoe
stretched
up
her
clinched
fists
to
heaven
with
a
groan
of
pleasure
turning
to
me
she
asked
how
would
you
like
to
see
the
hogs
the
old
man
added
as
an
extra
encouragement
pootiest
band
of
hogs
in
tulare
county
there
s
littler
of
the
real
nor
mexican
racer
stock
than
any
band
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
state
i
driv
the
original
outfit
from
pike
county
to
oregon
in
and
by
this
time
i
was
actually
interested
in
them
and
joining
susan
we
passed
out
into
the
forest
the
full
moon
now
high
in
the
heavens
looked
down
over
the
whole
landscape
of
clustered
forest
and
open
meadow
with
tranquil
silvery
light
it
whitened
measurably
the
fine
spiry
tips
of
the
trees
fell
luminous
upon
broad
bosses
of
granite
which
here
and
there
rose
through
the
soil
and
glanced
in
trembling
reflections
from
the
rushing
surface
of
the
brook
far
in
the
distance
moonlit
peaks
towered
in
solemn
rank
against
the
sky
we
walked
silently
on
four
or
five
minutes
through
the
woods
coming
at
last
upon
a
fence
which
margined
a
wide
circular
opening
in
the
wood
the
bars
as
her
father
had
feared
were
down
we
stepped
over
them
quietly
entered
the
enclosure
put
them
up
behind
us
and
proceeded
to
the
middle
threading
our
way
among
sleeping
swine
to
where
a
lonely
tree
rose
to
the
height
of
about
two
hundred
feet
against
this
we
placed
our
backs
and
susan
waved
her
hand
in
pride
over
the
two
acres
of
tranquil
pork
the
eye
after
accustoming
itself
to
the
darkness
took
cognizance
of
a
certain
ridgyness
of
surface
which
came
to
be
recognized
as
the
objects
of
susan
s
pride
quite
a
pretty
effect
was
caused
by
the
shadow
of
the
forest
which
cast
obliquely
downward
by
the
moon
divided
the
corral
into
halves
of
light
and
shade
the
air
was
filled
with
heavy
breathing
interrupted
by
here
and
there
a
snore
and
at
times
by
crescendos
of
tumult
caused
by
forty
or
fifty
pigs
doing
battle
for
some
favorite
i
was
informed
that
susan
did
not
wish
me
to
judge
of
them
by
dark
but
to
see
them
again
in
the
full
light
of
day
she
knew
each
individual
pig
by
its
physiognomy
having
as
she
said
growed
with
as
we
strolled
back
toward
the
bars
a
dusky
form
disputed
our
way
two
small
sharp
eyes
and
a
wild
crest
of
bristles
were
visible
in
the
obscure
light
that
s
old
arkansas
said
susan
he
s
eight
year
old
come
next
june
and
i
never
could
get
him
to
like
i
felt
for
my
pistol
but
susan
struck
a
vigorous
attitude
ejaculating
arkansas
she
made
a
dash
in
his
direction
a
wild
scuffle
ensued
in
which
i
heard
the
dull
thud
of
susan
s
shoe
accompanied
by
take
that
a
cloud
of
dust
one
shrill
squeal
and
arkansas
retreated
into
the
darkness
at
a
trot
when
quite
near
the
bars
the
mighty
girl
launched
herself
into
the
air
alighting
with
her
stomach
across
the
topmost
rail
where
she
hung
a
brief
moment
made
a
violent
muscular
contraction
and
alighted
upon
the
ground
outside
communicating
to
it
a
tremor
quite
perceptible
from
where
i
stood
i
climbed
over
after
her
and
we
sauntered
under
the
trees
back
to
camp
the
family
had
disappeared
a
few
dry
boughs
however
thrown
upon
the
coals
blazed
up
and
revealed
their
forms
in
the
corrugated
topography
of
the
bed
i
bade
susan
and
before
i
could
turn
my
back
she
kicked
her
number
eleven
shoes
into
the
air
and
with
masterly
rapidity
turned
in
as
minerva
is
said
to
have
done
in
full
panoply
i
fled
precipitately
to
my
camp
and
sought
my
blankets
lying
awake
in
a
kind
of
in
which
susan
and
arkansas
the
old
woman
and
her
coons
were
the
prominent
figures
later
i
fell
asleep
and
lay
motionless
until
the
distant
roar
of
swine
awoke
me
before
sunrise
next
morning
seated
upon
my
blankets
i
beheld
susan
s
mother
drag
forth
the
two
children
one
after
another
by
the
napes
of
their
necks
and
shaking
the
sleep
out
of
them
propel
them
spitefully
toward
the
brook
then
taking
her
pipe
from
her
mouth
she
bent
low
over
the
sleeping
form
of
her
huge
daughter
and
in
a
high
shrill
nasal
key
screeched
in
her
ear
yew
suse
no
sign
of
life
on
the
part
of
the
daughter
susan
you
to
get
up
slight
muscular
contraction
of
the
lower
limbs
will
you
hear
me
marm
whispered
the
girl
in
low
sleepy
tones
get
up
and
let
the
out
the
idea
had
at
length
thrilled
into
susan
s
brain
and
with
a
violent
suddenness
she
sat
bolt
upright
brushing
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
rubbing
those
valuable
but
bleared
organs
with
the
ponderous
knuckles
of
her
forefingers
by
this
time
i
started
for
the
brook
for
my
morning
toilet
and
the
girl
and
i
met
upon
opposite
banks
stooping
to
wash
our
faces
in
the
same
pool
as
i
opened
my
her
lower
jaw
fell
revealing
a
row
of
ivory
teeth
rounded
out
by
two
wisdoms
which
had
all
that
dazzling
grin
one
sees
in
the
of
certain
dental
practitioners
it
required
but
a
moment
to
gather
up
a
quart
or
so
of
water
in
her
broad
palms
and
rub
it
vigorously
into
a
small
circle
upon
the
middle
of
her
face
the
moisture
working
outward
to
a
certain
mark
which
along
her
chin
and
cheeks
defined
the
limits
of
former
ablution
then
baring
her
large
red
arms
to
the
elbow
she
washed
her
hands
and
stood
resting
them
upon
her
hips
dripping
freely
and
watching
me
with
intense
curiosity
when
i
reached
the
towel
process
she
herself
twisted
her
body
after
the
manner
of
the
belvidere
torso
bent
low
her
head
gathered
up
the
back
breadths
of
her
petticoat
and
wiped
her
face
vigorously
upon
it
which
had
the
effect
of
tracing
concentric
streaks
irregularly
over
her
countenance
i
parted
my
hair
by
the
aid
of
a
small
which
so
fired
susan
that
she
crossed
the
stream
with
a
mighty
jump
and
stood
in
ecstasy
by
my
side
she
borrowed
the
glass
and
then
my
comb
rewashed
her
face
and
fell
to
work
diligently
upon
her
hair
all
this
did
not
so
limit
my
perception
as
to
prevent
my
watching
the
general
demeanor
of
the
family
the
old
man
lay
back
at
his
ease
puffing
a
cloud
of
smoke
his
wife
also
emitting
volumes
of
the
vapor
of
navy
plug
squatted
by
the
frying
certain
lumps
of
pork
and
communicating
an
occasional
spiral
jerk
to
the
with
the
purpose
apparently
of
stirring
the
grounds
the
two
children
had
gotten
upon
the
back
of
a
contemplative
ass
who
stood
by
the
upper
side
of
the
bed
quietly
munching
the
corner
of
a
comforter
my
friend
was
in
no
haste
she
squandered
much
time
upon
the
arrangement
of
her
towy
hair
and
there
was
something
like
a
blush
of
conscious
satisfaction
when
she
handed
me
back
my
and
remarked
ironically
oh
no
i
guess
not
no
i
begged
her
to
accept
the
comb
and
glass
which
she
did
with
maidenly
joy
this
unusual
toilet
had
stimulated
with
susan
s
every
fibre
and
as
she
sprang
back
across
the
brook
and
approached
her
mother
s
i
could
not
fail
to
admire
the
magnificent
turn
of
her
shoulders
and
the
powerful
queenly
poise
of
her
head
her
full
grand
form
and
heavy
strength
reminded
me
of
the
statues
of
ceres
yet
there
was
withal
a
very
unpleasant
suggestion
of
fighting
trim
a
sort
of
manner
of
swinging
the
arms
and
hitching
the
shoulders
she
suddenly
spied
the
children
upon
the
jackass
and
with
one
wide
sweep
of
her
right
arm
projected
them
over
the
creature
s
head
and
planted
her
left
eleven
firmly
in
the
ribs
of
the
donkey
who
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
in
the
direction
of
the
leaving
her
executing
a
pas
seul
a
kind
of
slow
stately
jig
something
between
the
minuet
and
the
accompanying
herself
by
a
air
and
a
vigorous
beating
of
time
upon
her
slightly
lifted
knee
it
required
my
pike
county
friends
but
ten
minutes
to
swallow
their
pork
and
begin
the
labors
of
the
day
the
mountaineers
camp
was
not
yet
astir
these
children
of
the
forest
were
well
chained
in
slumber
for
unless
there
is
some
special
programme
for
the
day
it
requires
the
leverage
of
a
high
sun
to
arouse
their
faculties
dormant
enough
by
nature
and
soothed
into
deepest
quiet
by
whiskey
about
eight
o
clock
they
breakfasted
and
by
nine
had
engaged
my
innocent
in
a
game
of
social
poker
i
visited
my
horses
and
had
them
picketed
in
the
best
possible
feed
and
congratulated
myself
that
they
were
recruiting
finely
for
the
difficult
ride
before
me
susan
after
a
second
appeal
from
her
mother
ran
over
to
the
corral
and
let
out
the
family
capital
which
streamed
with
exultant
grunt
through
the
forest
darkening
the
fair
green
meadow
gardens
and
happily
passing
out
of
sight
when
i
had
breakfasted
i
joined
newty
in
his
trip
to
the
corral
where
we
stood
together
for
hours
during
which
i
had
mastered
the
story
of
his
years
since
in
he
left
his
old
home
in
pike
of
missouri
it
was
one
of
those
histories
common
enough
through
this
wide
west
yet
never
failing
to
startle
me
with
its
horrible
lesson
of
social
disintegration
of
human
retrograde
that
brave
spirit
of
westward
ho
which
has
been
the
pillar
of
fire
and
cloud
leading
on
the
weary
march
of
progress
over
stretches
of
desert
lining
the
way
with
graves
of
strong
men
of
lives
of
sad
patient
mothers
whose
pathetic
longing
for
the
new
home
died
with
them
of
the
thousand
old
and
young
whose
last
agony
came
to
them
as
they
marched
with
eyes
strained
on
after
the
sunken
sun
and
whose
shallow
barrows
scarcely
lift
over
the
drifting
dust
of
the
desert
that
restless
spirit
which
has
dared
to
uproot
the
old
and
plant
the
new
kindling
the
grand
energy
of
california
laying
foundations
for
a
state
to
be
that
is
admirable
is
poetic
is
to
fill
an
immortal
page
in
the
story
of
america
but
when
instead
of
urging
on
to
wresting
from
new
lands
something
better
than
old
can
give
it
degenerates
into
mere
restlessness
killing
the
power
of
growth
the
ideal
of
home
the
faculty
of
repose
it
results
in
that
race
of
perpetual
emigrants
who
roam
as
dreary
waifs
over
the
west
losing
possessions
love
of
life
love
of
god
slowly
dragging
from
valley
to
valley
till
they
fall
by
the
wayside
happy
if
some
chance
stranger
performs
for
them
the
last
rites
often
less
fortunate
as
blanched
bones
and
fluttering
rags
upon
too
many
hillsides
plainly
tell
the
newtys
were
of
this
dreary
brotherhood
in
with
a
small
family
of
that
authentic
strain
of
swine
for
which
pike
county
is
widely
known
as
newty
avers
they
bade
missouri
and
their
snug
farm
and
having
packed
their
household
goods
into
a
wagon
drawn
by
two
spotted
oxen
set
out
with
the
baby
susan
for
oregon
where
they
came
after
a
year
s
march
tired
and
cursed
with
a
permanent
discontent
there
they
had
taken
up
a
rancho
a
of
public
domain
which
at
the
end
of
two
years
was
improved
to
the
extent
of
the
neatest
little
worm
fence
this
side
of
pike
a
barn
and
a
in
another
year
said
my
friend
i
d
have
dug
for
a
house
but
we
tuck
ager
and
the
second
baby
one
day
there
came
a
man
who
let
on
that
he
knowed
land
in
california
much
fairer
and
more
worthy
tillage
than
oregon
s
best
so
the
poor
newtys
harnessed
up
the
wagon
and
turned
their
backs
upon
a
home
nearly
ready
for
comfortable
life
and
swept
south
with
pigs
and
plunder
through
all
the
years
this
story
had
repeated
itself
new
homes
gotten
to
the
edge
of
completion
more
babies
born
more
graves
made
more
pigs
who
replenished
as
only
the
pike
county
variety
may
till
it
seemed
to
me
the
mere
multiplication
of
them
must
reach
a
sufficient
dead
weight
to
anchor
the
family
but
this
was
dispelled
when
newty
remarked
these
yer
hogs
is
awkward
about
moving
and
i
ve
pretty
much
made
up
my
mind
to
put
em
all
into
bacon
this
fall
and
sell
out
and
start
for
poor
fellow
at
montana
he
will
probably
find
a
man
from
texas
who
in
half
an
hour
will
persuade
him
that
happiness
lies
there
as
we
walked
back
to
their
camp
and
when
dame
newty
hove
in
sight
my
friend
ventured
to
say
don
t
you
mind
the
old
woman
and
her
coons
she
s
from
arkansas
she
used
to
say
no
man
could
have
susan
who
couldn
t
show
coonskins
enough
of
his
own
killing
to
make
a
but
she
s
over
that
in
spite
of
this
assurance
my
heart
fell
a
trifle
when
the
first
moment
of
our
return
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
asked
do
you
mind
what
a
on
coons
our
little
johnnie
was
when
he
was
ten
years
old
i
secretly
wondered
if
the
had
anything
to
do
with
his
untimely
demise
at
eleven
but
kept
silence
regarding
her
as
a
sad
product
of
the
disease
of
chronic
emigration
her
hard
thin
nature
all
angles
and
stings
became
to
me
one
of
the
most
depressing
and
pathetic
spectacles
and
the
more
when
her
boy
a
mass
of
bilious
lymph
came
and
sat
by
her
looking
up
with
great
haggard
eyes
as
if
pleading
for
something
he
knew
not
what
but
which
i
plainly
saw
only
death
could
bestow
noon
brought
the
hour
of
my
departure
susan
and
her
father
talked
apart
a
moment
then
the
old
man
said
the
two
would
ride
along
with
me
for
a
few
miles
as
he
had
to
go
in
that
direction
to
look
for
new
i
despatched
my
two
men
with
the
directing
them
to
follow
the
trail
then
saddled
my
kaweah
and
waited
for
the
newtys
the
old
man
saddled
a
shaggy
little
mountain
pony
for
himself
and
for
susan
strapped
a
sheepskin
upon
the
back
of
a
young
and
fiery
mustang
colt
while
they
were
getting
ready
i
made
my
horse
fast
to
a
stake
and
stepped
over
to
bid
to
newty
i
said
to
her
in
tones
of
deference
i
have
come
to
bid
you
madam
and
when
i
get
back
this
way
i
hope
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
one
or
two
really
i
am
quite
ignorant
of
that
animal
having
been
raised
in
countries
where
they
are
extremely
rare
and
i
would
like
to
know
more
of
what
seems
to
be
to
you
a
creature
of
such
the
wet
gray
eyes
relaxed
as
i
fancied
a
trifle
of
their
asperity
a
faint
kindle
seemed
to
light
them
for
an
instant
as
she
asked
you
never
see
coons
catch
frogs
in
a
spring
branch
no
madam
i
answered
well
i
wonder
well
take
care
of
yourself
and
when
you
come
back
this
way
stop
along
with
us
and
we
ll
kill
a
yearlin
and
i
ll
tell
you
about
a
coon
that
used
to
live
under
grandfather
s
she
actually
offered
me
her
hand
which
i
grasped
and
shook
in
a
friendly
manner
chilled
to
the
very
bone
with
its
damp
coldness
newty
mounted
and
asked
me
if
i
was
ready
susan
stood
holding
her
prancing
mustang
to
put
that
girl
on
her
horse
after
the
ordinary
plan
would
have
required
the
strength
of
samson
or
the
use
of
a
neither
of
which
i
possessed
so
i
waited
for
events
to
develop
themselves
the
girl
stepped
to
the
left
side
of
her
horse
twisted
one
hand
in
the
mane
laying
the
other
upon
his
haunches
and
crouching
for
a
jump
sailed
through
the
air
alighting
upon
the
sheepskin
the
horse
reared
and
susan
twisting
herself
round
came
right
side
up
with
her
knee
upon
the
sheepskin
shouting
as
she
did
so
i
guess
you
don
t
get
me
off
sir
i
jumped
upon
kaweah
and
our
two
horses
sprang
forward
together
susan
waving
her
hand
to
her
father
and
crying
come
along
after
old
man
and
to
her
mother
take
care
of
yourself
which
is
the
pike
county
for
revoir
her
mustang
tugged
at
the
bit
and
bounded
wildly
into
the
air
we
reached
a
at
full
gallop
the
horses
clearing
it
at
a
bound
sweeping
on
over
the
green
floor
and
under
the
magnificent
shadow
of
the
forest
newty
following
us
at
an
humble
trot
slopped
through
the
creek
and
when
i
last
looked
he
had
nearly
reached
the
edge
of
the
wood
i
could
but
admire
the
unconscious
excellence
of
susan
s
riding
her
firm
immovable
seat
and
the
perfect
coolness
with
which
she
held
the
fiery
horse
this
quite
absorbed
me
for
five
minutes
when
she
at
last
broke
the
silence
by
the
laconic
inquiry
does
yourn
buck
to
which
i
added
the
reply
that
he
had
only
occasionally
been
guilty
of
that
indiscretion
she
then
informed
me
that
the
first
time
she
had
mounted
the
colt
he
had
nearly
bucked
her
to
pieces
he
had
jumped
and
jounced
till
she
was
plum
tuckered
out
before
he
had
given
up
gradually
reining
the
horses
down
and
inducing
them
to
walk
we
rode
side
by
side
through
the
most
magnificent
forest
of
the
sierras
and
i
determined
to
probe
susan
to
see
whether
there
were
not
even
in
the
most
latent
condition
some
germs
of
the
appreciation
of
nature
i
looked
from
base
to
summit
of
the
magnificent
shafts
at
the
green
plumes
which
traced
themselves
against
the
sky
the
exquisite
fall
of
purple
shadows
and
golden
light
upon
trunks
at
the
labyrinth
of
glowing
flowers
at
the
sparkling
whiteness
of
the
mountain
brook
and
up
to
the
clear
matchless
blue
that
vaulted
over
us
then
turned
to
susan
s
plain
honest
face
and
gradually
introduced
the
subject
of
trees
ideas
of
lumber
and
utilitarian
notions
of
were
uppermost
in
her
mind
but
i
briefly
penetrated
what
proved
to
be
only
a
superficial
stratum
of
the
materialistic
and
asked
her
point
blank
if
she
did
not
admire
their
stately
symmetry
a
strange
new
light
gleamed
in
her
eye
as
i
described
to
her
the
growth
and
distribution
of
forests
and
the
marvellous
change
in
their
character
and
aspects
as
they
approached
the
tropics
the
palm
and
the
pine
as
i
worked
them
up
to
her
really
filled
her
with
delight
and
prompted
numerous
interested
and
intelligent
queries
showing
that
she
thoroughly
comprehended
my
drift
in
the
pleasant
hour
of
our
chat
i
learned
a
new
lesson
of
the
presence
of
undeveloped
seed
in
the
human
mind
newty
at
last
came
alongside
and
remarked
that
he
must
stop
about
here
but
he
added
susan
will
go
on
with
you
about
half
a
mile
and
come
back
and
join
me
here
after
i
have
taken
a
look
at
the
as
he
rode
out
into
the
forest
a
little
way
he
called
me
to
him
and
i
was
a
little
puzzled
at
what
seemed
to
be
the
first
traces
of
embarrassment
i
had
seen
in
his
manner
you
ll
take
care
of
yourself
now
won
t
you
he
asked
i
tried
to
convince
him
that
i
would
a
slight
pause
you
ll
take
care
of
yourself
won
t
you
he
might
rely
on
it
i
was
going
to
say
he
added
thet
thet
thet
man
what
gits
susan
half
the
then
turning
promptly
away
he
spurred
the
pony
and
his
words
as
he
rode
into
the
forest
were
take
good
care
of
yourself
susan
and
i
rode
on
for
half
a
mile
until
we
reached
the
brow
of
a
long
descent
which
she
gave
me
to
understand
was
her
limit
we
shook
hands
and
i
bade
her
and
as
i
trotted
off
these
words
fell
sweetly
upon
my
ear
say
you
ll
take
good
care
of
yourself
won
t
you
say
i
took
pains
not
to
overtake
my
wishing
to
be
alone
and
as
i
rode
for
hour
after
hour
the
picture
of
this
family
stood
before
me
in
all
its
deformity
of
outline
all
its
poverty
of
detail
all
its
darkness
of
future
and
i
believe
i
thought
of
it
too
gravely
to
enjoy
as
i
might
the
subtle
light
of
comedy
which
plays
about
these
hard
repulsive
figures
in
conversation
i
had
caught
the
clew
of
a
better
past
newty
s
father
was
a
and
he
spoke
of
him
as
a
man
of
intelligence
and
as
i
should
judge
of
some
education
newty
s
father
had
been
an
arkansas
judge
not
perhaps
the
most
enlightened
of
men
but
still
very
far
in
advance
of
herself
the
conspicuous
retrograde
seemed
to
me
an
example
of
the
most
hopeless
phase
of
human
life
if
as
i
suppose
we
may
all
sooner
or
later
give
in
our
adhesion
to
the
darwinian
view
of
development
does
not
the
same
law
which
permits
such
splendid
scope
for
the
better
open
up
to
us
also
possible
gulfs
of
degradation
and
are
not
these
chronic
emigrants
whose
wagons
and
weary
faces
greet
you
along
the
dusty
highways
of
the
far
west
melancholy
examples
of
beings
who
have
forever
lost
the
conservatism
of
home
and
the
power
of
improvement
vi
kaweah
s
run
after
trying
hard
to
climb
mount
whitney
without
success
and
having
returned
to
the
plains
i
enjoyed
my
two
days
rest
in
hot
visalia
where
were
fruits
and
people
and
where
i
at
length
thawed
out
the
last
traces
of
alpine
cold
and
recovered
from
hard
work
and
the
sinful
bread
of
my
fortnight
s
campaign
i
considered
it
happiness
to
spend
my
whole
day
on
the
quiet
hotel
veranda
accustoming
myself
again
to
such
articles
as
chairs
and
newspapers
and
watching
with
unexpected
pleasure
the
few
village
girls
who
flitted
about
during
the
day
and
actually
found
time
after
sunset
to
chat
with
favored
fellows
beneath
the
wide
oaks
of
the
especially
interesting
seemed
the
rustic
sister
of
whom
i
bought
figs
at
a
garden
gate
thinking
her
as
i
did
il
though
recollecting
later
that
her
gown
was
of
forgotten
mode
and
that
she
carried
a
suggestion
of
ancient
history
in
the
obsolete
style
of
her
back
hair
everybody
was
of
interest
to
me
not
excepting
the
two
mexican
mountaineers
who
monopolized
the
agent
at
wells
fargo
s
office
causing
me
delay
they
were
transacting
some
little
item
of
business
and
stood
loafing
by
the
counter
mechanically
jingling
huge
spurs
and
shrugging
their
shoulders
as
they
chatted
in
a
dull
sleepy
way
at
the
door
they
paused
keeping
up
quite
a
lively
dispute
without
apparently
noticing
me
as
i
drew
a
small
bag
of
gold
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
there
was
no
especial
reason
why
i
should
remark
the
stolid
brutal
cast
of
their
countenances
as
i
thought
them
not
worse
than
the
average
californian
greaser
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
one
might
as
well
guess
at
a
geological
formation
as
to
attempt
to
judge
the
age
of
mountaineers
because
they
get
very
early
in
life
a
fixed
expression
which
is
deepened
by
continual
rough
weathering
and
undisturbed
accumulations
of
dirt
i
observed
them
enough
to
see
that
the
elder
was
a
man
of
middle
height
of
wiry
light
figure
and
thin
hawk
visage
a
certain
angular
sharpness
making
itself
noticeable
about
the
shoulders
and
arms
which
tapered
to
small
almost
refined
hands
a
mere
fringe
of
perfectly
straight
black
beard
followed
the
curve
of
his
chin
tangling
itself
at
the
ear
with
shaggy
unkempt
locks
of
hair
he
wore
an
ordinary
spanish
sombrero
and
the
inevitable
greasy
red
sash
performed
its
rather
difficult
task
of
holding
together
flannel
shirt
and
buckskin
breeches
besides
half
covering
with
folds
a
long
narrow
knife
his
companion
struck
me
as
a
indian
somewhere
about
eighteen
years
of
age
his
beardless
face
showing
deep
brutal
lines
and
a
mouth
which
was
a
mere
crease
between
hideously
heavy
lips
blood
stained
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
an
old
felt
hat
crumpled
and
ragged
slouched
forward
over
his
eyes
doing
its
best
to
hide
the
man
i
thought
them
a
hard
couple
and
summed
up
their
traits
as
stolidity
and
utter
cruelty
i
was
pleased
that
the
who
saddled
kaweah
was
unable
to
answer
their
inquiry
where
i
was
going
and
annoyed
when
i
heard
the
inform
them
that
i
started
that
day
for
millerton
leaving
behind
us
people
and
village
kaweah
bore
me
out
under
the
grateful
shade
of
oaks
among
rambling
settlements
and
fields
of
harvested
grain
whose
pale
stubble
and
stacks
contrasted
finely
with
the
deep
foliage
and
served
as
a
pretty
groundwork
for
stripes
of
vivid
green
which
marked
the
course
of
numberless
irrigating
streams
low
cottages
overarched
with
boughs
and
hemmed
in
with
weed
jungles
margined
my
road
i
saw
at
the
gate
many
children
who
looked
me
out
of
countenance
with
their
serious
stupid
stare
they
were
the
least
of
any
human
beings
i
have
seen
trees
and
settlements
and
children
were
soon
behind
us
an
open
plain
stretching
on
in
front
without
visible
limit
a
plain
slightly
browned
with
the
traces
of
dried
herbaceous
plants
and
unrelieved
by
other
object
than
distant
processions
of
trees
traced
from
some
cañon
gate
of
the
sierras
westward
across
to
the
middle
valley
or
occasional
bands
of
restless
cattle
marching
solemnly
about
in
search
of
food
it
was
not
pleasant
to
realize
that
i
had
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
of
this
lonely
sort
of
landscape
ahead
of
me
nor
that
my
only
companion
was
kaweah
for
with
all
his
splendid
powers
and
rare
qualities
of
instinct
there
was
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
response
or
affection
in
his
behavior
friendly
toleration
was
the
highest
gift
he
bestowed
on
me
though
i
think
he
had
great
personal
enjoyment
in
my
habits
as
a
rider
the
only
moments
when
we
ever
seemed
thoroughly
were
when
i
crowded
him
down
to
a
wild
run
using
the
spur
and
shouting
at
him
loudly
or
when
in
our
friendly
races
homeward
toward
camp
through
the
forest
i
put
him
at
a
leap
where
he
even
doubted
his
own
power
at
such
times
i
could
communicate
ideas
to
him
with
absolute
certainty
he
would
stop
or
turn
or
gather
himself
for
a
leap
at
my
will
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
some
sort
of
magnetic
communication
but
i
always
paid
dearly
for
this
in
long
tiresome
efforts
to
calm
him
with
the
long
level
road
ahead
of
me
i
dared
not
attack
its
monotony
by
any
unusual
riding
and
having
settled
him
at
our
regular
travelling
trot
a
gait
of
about
six
miles
an
hour
i
forgot
all
about
the
dreary
expanse
of
plain
and
gave
myself
up
to
quiet
reverie
about
dusk
we
had
reached
the
king
s
river
ferry
an
ugly
unpainted
house
perched
upon
the
bluff
and
flanked
by
barns
and
outbuildings
of
disorderly
aspect
overlooked
the
ferry
not
a
sign
of
green
vegetation
could
be
seen
except
certain
willows
standing
along
the
river
s
margin
and
that
dark
pine
zone
lifted
upon
the
sierras
in
eastern
distance
it
is
desperate
punishment
to
stay
through
a
summer
at
one
of
these
plain
ranches
there
to
be
beat
upon
by
an
unrelenting
sun
in
the
midst
of
a
scorched
landscape
and
forced
to
breathe
sirocco
and
sand
yet
there
are
found
plenty
of
people
who
are
glad
to
become
master
of
one
of
these
ferries
or
stage
stations
their
life
for
the
most
part
silent
and
as
unvaried
as
its
outlook
given
over
wholly
to
permanent
and
vacant
loafing
supper
was
announced
by
a
youth
who
came
out
upon
the
veranda
and
vigorously
rang
a
tavern
bell
although
i
was
the
only
auditor
and
likely
enough
the
only
person
within
twenty
miles
i
envy
my
horse
at
such
times
the
graminivorous
have
us
at
a
disadvantage
for
one
revolts
at
the
although
disliking
to
insult
the
house
by
quietly
shying
the
food
out
of
the
window
i
arose
hungry
from
the
table
remembering
that
some
eminent
hygeist
has
avowed
that
by
so
doing
one
has
achieved
sanitary
success
as
i
walked
over
to
see
kaweah
at
the
corral
i
glanced
down
the
river
and
saw
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
two
horsemen
ride
down
our
bank
spur
their
horses
into
the
stream
swim
to
the
other
side
and
struggle
up
a
steep
bank
disappearing
among
bunches
of
cottonwood
trees
near
the
river
so
dangerous
and
unusual
a
proceeding
could
not
have
been
to
save
the
ferriage
there
was
something
about
their
seat
and
the
cruel
way
they
drove
home
their
spurs
that
in
default
of
better
reasons
made
me
think
them
mexicans
the
whole
tulare
plain
is
the
home
of
nomadic
ranchers
who
as
pasturage
changes
drive
about
their
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
from
range
to
range
and
as
the
wolves
prowl
around
for
prey
so
a
class
of
mexican
highwaymen
rob
and
murder
them
from
one
year
s
end
to
the
other
i
judged
the
swimmers
were
bent
on
some
such
errand
and
lay
down
on
the
ground
by
kaweah
to
guard
him
rolling
myself
in
my
soldier
s
and
slept
with
my
saddle
for
a
pillow
once
or
twice
the
animal
waked
me
up
by
stamping
restively
but
i
could
perceive
no
cause
for
alarm
and
slept
on
comfortably
until
a
little
before
sunrise
when
i
rose
took
a
plunge
in
the
river
and
hurriedly
dressed
myself
for
the
day
s
ride
the
ferryman
who
had
promised
to
put
me
across
at
dawn
was
already
at
his
post
and
after
permitting
kaweah
to
drink
a
deep
draught
i
rode
him
out
on
the
and
was
quickly
at
the
other
side
the
road
for
two
or
three
miles
ascends
the
right
bank
of
the
river
approaching
in
places
quite
closely
to
the
edge
of
its
bluffs
i
greatly
enjoyed
my
ride
watching
the
sierra
sky
line
high
and
black
against
a
golden
circle
of
dawn
and
seeing
it
mirrored
faithfully
in
still
reaches
of
river
and
pleasing
myself
with
the
continually
changing
foreground
as
group
after
group
of
tall
motionless
cottonwoods
was
passed
the
willows
too
are
pleasing
in
their
entire
harmony
with
the
scene
and
the
air
they
have
of
protecting
bank
and
shore
from
torrent
and
sun
the
plain
stretched
off
to
my
left
into
dusky
distance
and
ahead
in
a
bare
smooth
expanse
dreary
by
its
monotony
yet
not
altogether
repulsive
in
the
pearly
obscurity
of
the
morning
in
midsummer
these
plains
are
as
hot
as
the
sahara
through
the
long
blinding
day
but
after
midnight
there
comes
a
delicious
blandness
upon
the
air
a
suggestion
of
freshness
and
upspringing
life
which
renews
vitality
within
you
kaweah
showed
the
influence
of
this
condition
in
the
sensitive
play
of
ears
and
toss
of
head
and
in
his
free
spirited
stride
i
was
experimenting
on
his
sensitiveness
to
sounds
and
had
found
that
his
ears
turned
back
at
the
faintest
whisper
when
suddenly
his
head
rose
he
looked
sharply
forward
toward
a
clump
of
trees
on
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
front
of
us
where
a
quick
glance
revealed
to
me
a
and
two
men
hurrying
saddles
upon
their
horses
a
gray
and
a
sorrel
they
were
spaniards
the
same
who
had
swum
king
s
river
the
afternoon
before
and
as
it
flashed
on
me
finally
the
two
whom
i
had
studied
so
attentively
at
visalia
then
i
at
once
saw
their
purpose
was
to
waylay
me
and
made
up
my
mind
to
give
them
a
lively
run
the
road
followed
the
bank
up
to
their
camp
in
an
easterly
direction
and
then
turning
a
sharp
right
angle
to
the
north
led
out
upon
the
open
plain
leaving
the
river
finally
i
decided
to
strike
across
and
threw
kaweah
into
a
sharp
trot
i
glanced
at
my
girth
and
then
at
the
bright
copper
upon
my
pistol
and
settled
myself
firmly
in
the
saddle
finding
that
they
could
not
saddle
quickly
enough
to
attack
me
mounted
the
older
villain
grabbed
a
and
sprung
out
to
head
me
off
his
comrade
meantime
tightening
the
cinches
i
turned
kaweah
farther
off
to
the
left
and
tossed
him
a
little
more
rein
which
he
understood
and
sprang
out
into
a
gallop
the
robber
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
covered
me
and
yelled
in
good
english
hold
on
you
at
that
instant
his
companion
dashed
up
leading
the
other
horse
in
another
moment
they
were
mounted
and
after
me
yelling
to
the
mustangs
plunging
in
the
spurs
and
shouting
occasional
volleys
of
oaths
by
this
time
i
had
regained
the
road
which
lay
before
me
traced
over
the
blank
objectless
plain
in
vanishing
perspective
fifteen
miles
lay
between
me
and
a
station
kaweah
and
pistol
were
my
only
defence
yet
at
that
moment
i
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
a
wild
moment
of
inspiration
almost
worth
the
danger
to
experience
i
glanced
over
my
shoulder
and
found
that
the
spaniards
were
crowding
their
horses
to
their
fullest
speed
their
hoofs
rattling
on
the
dry
plain
were
accompanied
by
inarticulate
noises
like
the
cries
of
bloodhounds
kaweah
comprehended
the
situation
i
could
feel
his
grand
legs
gather
under
me
and
the
iron
muscles
contract
with
excitement
he
tugged
at
the
bit
shook
his
and
flung
himself
impatiently
into
the
air
it
flashed
upon
me
that
perhaps
they
had
confederates
concealed
in
some
ditch
far
in
advance
of
me
and
that
the
plan
was
to
crowd
me
through
at
fullest
speed
giving
up
the
chase
to
new
men
and
fresh
horses
and
i
resolved
to
save
kaweah
to
the
utmost
and
only
allow
him
a
speed
which
should
keep
me
out
of
gunshot
so
i
held
him
firmly
and
reserved
my
spur
for
the
last
emergency
still
we
fairly
flew
over
the
plain
and
i
said
to
myself
as
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
din
of
my
pursuers
rang
in
my
ears
now
and
then
as
the
freshening
breeze
hurried
it
forward
that
if
those
brutes
got
me
there
was
nothing
in
blood
and
brains
for
kaweah
was
a
prince
beside
their
mustangs
and
i
ought
to
be
worth
two
villains
for
the
first
twenty
minutes
the
road
was
hard
and
smooth
and
level
after
that
gentle
shallow
undulations
began
and
at
last
at
brief
intervals
were
sharp
narrow
arroyos
ditches
eight
or
nine
feet
wide
i
reined
kaweah
in
and
brought
him
up
sharply
on
their
bottoms
giving
him
the
bit
to
spring
up
on
the
other
side
but
he
quickly
taught
me
better
and
gathering
took
them
easily
without
my
feeling
it
in
his
stride
the
hot
sun
had
arisen
i
saw
with
anxiety
that
the
tremendous
speed
began
to
tell
painfully
on
kaweah
foam
tinged
with
blood
fell
from
his
mouth
and
sweat
rolled
in
streams
from
his
whole
body
and
now
and
then
he
drew
a
breath
i
leaned
down
and
felt
of
the
cinch
to
see
if
it
had
slipped
forward
but
as
i
had
saddled
him
with
great
care
it
kept
its
true
place
so
i
had
only
to
fear
the
greasers
behind
or
a
new
relay
ahead
i
was
conscious
of
plenty
of
reserved
speed
in
kaweah
whose
powerful
run
was
already
distancing
their
fatigued
mustangs
as
we
bounded
down
a
roll
of
the
plain
a
cloud
of
dust
sprang
from
a
ravine
directly
in
front
of
me
and
two
black
objects
lifted
themselves
in
the
sand
i
drew
my
pistol
cocked
it
whirled
kaweah
to
the
left
plunging
by
and
clearing
them
by
about
six
feet
a
thrill
of
relief
came
as
i
saw
the
long
white
horns
of
spanish
cattle
gleam
above
the
dust
unconsciously
i
restrained
kaweah
too
much
and
in
a
moment
the
spaniards
were
crowding
down
upon
me
at
a
fearful
rate
on
they
came
the
crash
of
their
spurs
and
the
clatter
of
their
horses
distinctly
heard
and
as
i
had
so
often
compared
the
beats
of
chronometers
i
unconsciously
noted
that
while
kaweah
s
although
painful
yet
came
with
regular
power
the
mustangs
respiration
was
quick
spasmodic
and
irregular
i
compared
the
intervals
of
the
two
mustangs
and
found
that
one
breathed
better
than
the
other
and
then
upon
counting
the
best
mustang
with
kaweah
found
that
he
breathed
nine
breaths
to
kaweah
s
seven
in
two
or
three
minutes
i
tried
it
again
finding
the
relation
ten
to
seven
then
i
felt
the
victory
and
i
yelled
to
kaweah
the
thin
ears
shot
flat
back
upon
his
neck
lower
and
lower
he
lay
down
to
his
run
i
flung
him
a
loose
rein
and
gave
him
a
friendly
pat
on
the
withers
it
was
a
glorious
burst
of
speed
the
wind
rushed
by
and
the
plain
swept
under
us
with
dizzying
swiftness
i
shouted
again
and
the
thing
of
nervous
life
under
me
bounded
on
wilder
and
faster
till
i
could
feel
his
spine
thrill
as
with
shocks
from
a
battery
i
managed
to
look
round
a
delicate
matter
at
speed
and
saw
far
behind
the
distanced
villains
both
dismounted
and
one
horse
fallen
in
an
instant
i
drew
kaweah
in
to
a
gentle
trot
looking
around
every
moment
lest
they
should
come
on
me
unawares
in
a
i
reached
the
station
and
i
was
cautiously
greeted
by
a
man
who
sat
by
the
barn
door
with
a
rifle
across
his
knees
he
had
seen
me
come
over
the
plain
and
had
also
seen
the
spanish
horse
fall
not
knowing
but
he
might
be
in
league
with
the
robbers
i
gave
him
a
careful
glance
before
dismounting
and
was
completely
reassured
by
an
expression
of
terror
which
had
possession
of
his
countenance
i
sprang
to
the
ground
and
threw
off
the
saddle
and
after
a
word
or
two
with
the
man
who
proved
to
be
the
sole
occupant
of
this
station
we
fell
to
work
together
upon
kaweah
my
cocked
pistol
and
his
rifle
lying
close
at
hand
we
sponged
the
creature
s
mouth
and
throwing
a
sheet
over
him
walked
him
regularly
up
and
down
for
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
and
then
taking
him
upon
the
open
plain
where
we
could
scan
the
horizon
in
all
directions
gave
him
a
thorough
grooming
i
never
saw
him
look
so
magnificently
as
when
we
led
him
down
to
the
creek
to
drink
his
skin
was
like
satin
and
the
veins
of
his
head
and
neck
stood
out
firm
and
round
like
in
the
excitement
of
taking
care
of
kaweah
i
had
scarcely
paid
any
attention
to
my
host
but
after
two
hours
when
the
horse
was
quietly
munching
his
hay
i
listened
attentively
to
his
story
the
two
spaniards
had
lurked
round
his
station
during
the
night
guns
in
hand
and
had
made
an
attempt
to
steal
a
pair
of
stage
horses
from
the
stable
but
as
he
had
watched
with
his
rifle
they
finally
rode
away
by
his
account
i
knew
them
to
be
my
pursuers
they
had
here
however
ridden
two
black
mustangs
and
had
doubtless
changed
their
mount
for
the
sole
purpose
of
waylaying
me
about
eleven
o
clock
it
being
my
turn
to
watch
the
horizon
i
saw
two
horsemen
making
a
long
round
the
station
disappearing
finally
in
the
direction
of
millerton
by
my
glass
i
could
only
make
out
that
they
were
men
riding
in
single
file
on
a
sorrel
and
a
gray
horse
but
this
with
the
fact
of
the
long
which
finally
brought
them
back
into
the
road
again
convinced
me
that
they
were
my
enemies
the
uncomfortable
probability
of
their
raising
a
band
and
returning
to
make
sure
of
my
capture
filled
me
with
disagreeable
foreboding
and
all
day
long
whether
my
turn
at
sentinel
duty
or
not
i
did
little
else
than
range
my
eye
over
the
valley
in
all
directions
twice
during
the
day
i
led
kaweah
out
and
paced
him
to
and
fro
for
fear
his
tremendous
exertion
would
cause
a
stiffening
of
the
legs
but
each
time
he
followed
close
to
my
shoulder
with
the
same
firm
proud
step
and
i
gloried
in
him
shortly
after
dark
i
determined
to
mount
and
push
forward
to
millerton
my
friend
the
station
man
having
given
me
careful
directions
as
to
its
position
and
i
knew
from
the
topography
of
the
country
that
by
abandoning
the
road
and
travelling
by
the
stars
i
could
not
widely
miss
my
mark
so
at
about
nine
o
clock
i
saddled
kaweah
and
mounting
bade
to
my
friend
the
air
was
bland
the
heavens
cloudless
and
starlit
in
the
west
a
low
arch
of
light
out
of
which
had
faded
the
last
traces
of
sunset
color
in
the
east
a
silver
dawn
shone
mild
and
pure
above
the
sierras
brightening
as
the
light
in
the
west
faded
till
at
last
one
jetty
crag
was
cut
upon
the
disk
of
rising
moon
upon
the
light
gray
tone
of
the
plain
every
object
might
be
seen
and
as
i
rode
on
the
memory
of
danger
passed
away
leaving
me
in
full
enjoyment
of
companionship
with
the
hour
and
with
my
friend
kaweah
whose
sturdy
easy
stride
was
in
itself
a
delight
there
is
a
charm
peculiar
to
these
soft
dewless
nights
it
seems
the
perfection
of
darkness
in
which
you
get
all
the
rest
of
sleep
while
riding
or
lying
wide
awake
on
your
blankets
now
and
then
an
object
vague
and
unrecognized
loomed
out
of
dusky
distance
arresting
our
attention
for
kaweah
s
quick
eye
usually
found
them
first
dead
carcases
of
starved
cattle
a
blanched
skull
or
stump
of
aged
oak
were
the
only
things
seen
and
we
gradually
got
accustomed
to
these
passing
with
no
more
than
a
glance
at
last
we
approached
a
region
of
low
rolling
where
kaweah
s
tread
became
muffled
and
the
silence
so
oppressive
as
to
call
out
from
me
a
whistle
that
instrument
proved
excellent
in
traviata
solos
but
when
i
attempted
some
of
chopin
failed
so
painfully
that
i
was
glad
to
be
diverted
by
arriving
at
the
summit
of
the
zone
of
hills
and
looking
out
upon
the
wide
shallow
valley
of
the
san
joaquin
a
plain
dotted
with
groves
and
lighted
here
and
there
by
open
reaches
of
moonlit
river
i
looked
up
and
down
searching
for
lights
which
should
mark
millerton
i
had
intended
to
strike
the
river
above
the
settlement
and
should
now
if
my
reckoning
was
correct
be
within
half
a
mile
of
it
riding
down
to
the
i
dismounted
and
allowed
kaweah
to
quench
his
thirst
the
cool
mountain
water
fresh
from
the
snow
was
delicious
to
him
he
drank
stopped
to
breathe
and
drank
again
and
again
i
allowed
him
also
to
feed
a
on
the
grass
by
the
and
then
remounting
headed
down
the
river
and
rode
slowly
along
under
the
shadow
of
trees
following
a
broad
trail
which
led
as
i
believed
to
the
village
while
in
a
grove
of
oaks
jingling
spurs
suddenly
sounded
ahead
and
directly
i
heard
voices
i
quickly
turned
kaweah
from
the
trail
and
tied
him
a
few
rods
off
behind
a
thicket
then
crawled
back
into
a
bunch
of
buckeye
bushes
disturbing
some
small
birds
who
took
flight
in
a
moment
two
horsemen
talking
spanish
neared
and
as
they
passed
i
recognized
their
horses
and
then
the
men
the
impulse
to
try
a
shot
was
so
strong
that
i
got
out
my
revolver
but
upon
second
thought
put
it
up
as
they
rode
on
into
the
shadow
the
younger
as
i
judged
by
his
voice
broke
out
into
a
delicious
melody
one
of
those
passionate
spanish
songs
with
a
peculiar
throbbing
cadence
which
he
emphasized
by
sharply
ringing
his
spurs
these
californian
scoundrels
are
invariably
crime
can
not
overshadow
the
exhilaration
of
outdoor
life
remorse
and
gloom
are
banished
like
clouds
before
this
perennially
sunny
climate
they
make
amusement
out
of
killing
you
and
regard
a
successful
plundering
time
as
a
sort
of
pleasantry
as
the
soft
full
tones
of
my
bandit
died
in
distance
i
went
for
kaweah
and
rode
rapidly
westward
in
the
opposite
direction
bringing
up
soon
in
the
outskirts
of
millerton
just
as
the
last
gamblers
were
closing
up
their
little
games
and
about
the
time
the
drunk
were
conveying
one
another
home
kaweah
being
stabled
i
went
to
the
hotel
an
excellent
and
orderly
establishment
where
a
colored
man
of
mild
manners
gave
me
supper
and
made
me
at
home
by
gentle
conversation
promising
at
last
to
wake
me
early
and
bidding
me
at
my
room
door
with
the
tones
of
an
old
friend
i
think
his
soothing
spirit
may
partly
account
for
the
genuinely
profound
sleep
into
which
i
quickly
fell
and
which
held
me
fast
bound
until
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
four
sir
called
me
back
and
renewed
the
currents
of
consciousness
after
we
had
had
our
breakfast
kaweah
and
i
forded
the
san
joaquin
and
i
at
once
left
the
road
determined
to
follow
a
mountain
trail
which
led
toward
mariposa
the
trail
proved
a
good
one
to
travel
of
smooth
soft
surface
and
pleasant
in
its
diversity
of
ups
and
downs
and
with
rambling
curves
which
led
through
open
regions
of
brown
hills
whose
fern
and
grass
were
ripened
to
a
common
then
among
slopes
crowned
with
fine
oaks
and
occasional
pine
woods
the
ground
frequently
covering
itself
with
clumps
of
such
shrubs
as
chaparral
and
the
manzanita
yet
i
think
i
never
saw
such
facilities
for
an
ambuscade
i
imagined
the
path
went
out
of
its
way
to
thread
every
thicket
and
the
very
trees
grouped
themselves
with
a
view
to
highway
robbery
i
soon
though
got
tired
looking
out
for
my
spaniards
and
became
assured
of
having
my
ride
to
myself
when
i
studied
the
trail
and
found
that
kaweah
s
were
the
first
tracks
of
the
day
riding
thus
in
the
late
summer
along
the
sierra
one
is
constantly
impressed
with
the
climatic
peculiarities
of
the
region
with
us
in
the
east
plant
life
seems
to
continue
until
it
is
at
last
put
out
by
cold
the
trees
appear
to
grow
till
the
first
frosts
but
in
the
sierra
growth
and
active
life
culminate
in
june
and
early
july
and
then
follow
long
months
of
warm
stormless
autumn
wherein
the
hills
grow
slowly
browner
and
the
whole
air
seems
to
ripen
into
a
fascinating
repose
a
rich
dreamy
quiet
with
distance
lost
behind
pearly
hazes
with
warm
tranquil
nights
dewless
and
silent
this
period
is
wealthy
in
yellows
and
russets
and
browns
in
great
overhanging
masses
of
oak
whose
olive
hue
is
warmed
into
umber
depth
in
groves
of
serious
pines
red
of
bark
and
cool
in
the
dark
greenness
of
their
spires
nature
wears
an
aspect
of
patient
waiting
for
a
great
change
ripeness
existence
beyond
the
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
of
life
a
long
pleasant
painless
waiting
for
death
these
are
the
conditions
of
the
vegetation
and
it
is
vegetation
more
than
the
peculiar
appearance
of
the
air
which
impresses
the
strange
character
of
the
season
it
is
as
if
our
august
should
grow
rich
and
ripe
through
cloudless
days
and
glorious
warm
nights
on
till
february
and
then
wake
as
from
sleep
to
break
out
in
the
bloom
of
may
i
was
delighted
to
ride
thus
alone
and
expose
myself
as
one
uncovers
a
sensitized
photographic
plate
to
be
influenced
for
this
is
a
respite
from
scientific
work
when
through
months
you
hold
yourself
accountable
for
seeing
everything
for
analyzing
for
instituting
perpetual
comparison
and
as
it
were
sharing
in
the
administering
of
the
physical
world
no
tongue
can
tell
the
relief
to
simply
withdraw
scientific
observation
and
let
nature
impress
you
in
the
dear
old
way
with
all
her
mystery
and
glory
with
those
vague
indescribable
emotions
which
tremble
between
wonder
and
sympathy
behind
me
in
distance
stretched
the
sere
plain
where
kaweah
s
run
saved
me
to
the
west
fading
out
into
warm
blank
distance
lay
the
great
valley
of
san
joaquin
into
which
descending
by
sinking
curves
were
rounded
hills
with
sunny
brown
slopes
softened
as
to
detail
by
a
low
clinging
bank
of
milky
air
now
and
then
out
of
the
haze
to
the
east
indistinct
rosy
peaks
with
dull
silvery
stood
dimly
up
against
the
sky
and
higher
yet
a
few
sharp
summits
lifted
into
the
clearer
heights
seemed
hung
there
floating
quite
in
harmony
with
this
was
the
little
group
of
dutch
settlements
i
passed
where
an
man
and
woman
sat
together
on
a
veranda
sunning
their
white
hair
and
silently
smoking
old
porcelain
pipes
nor
was
there
any
element
of
incongruity
at
the
rancheria
where
i
dismounted
to
rest
shortly
after
noon
a
few
sleepy
indians
lay
on
their
backs
dreaming
the
stout
squaws
nursing
pappooses
or
lying
outstretched
upon
red
blankets
the
agreeable
harmony
was
not
alone
from
the
indian
summer
in
their
blood
but
in
part
as
well
from
the
features
of
their
dress
and
facial
expression
their
clothes
of
caucasian
origin
quickly
fade
out
into
utter
barbarism
toning
down
to
warm
dirty
timbers
never
failing
to
be
relieved
here
and
there
by
ropes
of
blue
and
white
beads
or
and
girdle
of
scarlet
cloth
toward
the
late
afternoon
trotting
down
a
gentle
forest
slope
i
came
in
sight
of
a
number
of
ranch
buildings
grouped
about
a
central
open
space
a
small
stream
flowed
by
the
outbuildings
and
wound
among
spurs
below
considerable
crops
of
grain
had
been
gathered
into
a
corral
and
a
number
of
horses
were
quietly
straying
about
yet
with
all
the
evidences
of
considerable
possessions
the
whole
place
had
an
air
of
suspicious
riding
into
the
open
square
i
saw
that
one
of
the
buildings
was
a
store
and
to
this
i
rode
tying
kaweah
to
the
piazza
post
i
thought
the
whole
world
slumbered
when
i
beheld
the
sole
occupant
of
this
country
store
a
man
in
pantaloons
and
shirt
who
lay
on
his
back
upon
a
counter
fast
asleep
the
handle
of
a
revolver
grasped
in
his
right
hand
it
seemed
to
me
if
i
were
to
wake
him
up
a
little
too
suddenly
he
might
misunderstand
my
presence
and
do
some
accidental
damage
so
i
stepped
back
and
poked
kaweah
making
him
jump
and
clatter
his
hoofs
and
at
once
the
proprietor
sprang
to
the
door
looking
flustered
and
uneasy
i
asked
him
if
he
could
accommodate
me
for
the
afternoon
and
night
and
take
care
of
my
horse
to
which
he
replied
in
a
very
leisurely
manner
that
there
was
a
bed
and
something
to
eat
and
hay
and
that
if
i
was
inclined
to
take
the
chances
i
might
stay
being
in
mind
to
take
the
chances
i
did
stay
and
my
host
walked
out
with
me
to
the
corral
and
showed
me
where
to
get
kaweah
s
hay
and
grain
i
loafed
about
for
an
hour
or
two
finding
that
a
chinese
cook
was
the
only
other
human
being
in
sight
and
then
concluded
to
pump
the
landlord
a
s
trial
thoroughly
disgusted
me
and
i
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
i
did
however
learn
that
he
was
a
man
of
southern
birth
of
considerable
education
which
a
brutal
life
and
depraved
mind
had
not
been
able
to
fully
obliterate
he
seemed
to
care
very
little
for
his
business
which
indeed
was
small
enough
for
during
the
time
i
spent
there
not
a
single
customer
made
his
appearance
the
stock
of
goods
i
observed
on
examination
to
be
chiefly
every
manner
of
gambling
apparatus
and
liquors
the
few
pieces
of
stuffs
barrels
and
boxes
of
groceries
appeared
to
be
disposed
rather
as
ornaments
than
for
actual
sale
from
each
of
the
man
s
trousers
pockets
protruded
the
handle
of
a
derringer
and
behind
his
counter
were
arranged
in
convenient
position
two
or
three
i
remarked
to
him
that
he
seemed
to
have
a
handily
arranged
arsenal
at
which
he
regarded
me
with
a
cool
quiet
stare
polished
the
handle
of
one
of
his
derringers
upon
his
trousers
examined
the
with
great
deliberation
and
then
with
a
nod
of
the
head
intended
to
convey
great
force
said
you
don
t
live
in
these
parts
a
fact
for
which
i
felt
not
unthankful
the
man
drank
brandy
freely
and
often
and
at
intervals
of
about
half
an
hour
called
to
his
side
a
plethoric
old
cat
named
gospel
stroked
her
with
nervous
rapidity
swearing
at
the
same
time
in
so
and
unconscious
a
manner
that
he
seemed
mechanically
talking
to
himself
whoever
has
travelled
on
the
west
coast
has
not
failed
to
notice
the
fearful
volleys
of
oaths
which
the
hurl
at
their
teams
but
for
ingenious
flights
of
fancy
profanity
i
have
never
met
the
equal
of
my
host
with
the
most
perfect
and
in
unmoved
continuance
he
uttered
florid
blasphemies
which
i
think
must
have
taken
hours
to
invent
i
was
glad
when
bedtime
came
to
be
relieved
of
his
presence
and
especially
pleased
when
he
took
me
to
the
little
separate
building
in
which
was
a
narrow
single
bed
next
this
building
on
the
left
was
the
and
and
upon
the
right
lay
his
own
sleeping
apartment
directly
across
the
square
and
not
more
than
sixty
feet
off
was
the
gate
of
the
corral
which
creaked
on
its
rusty
hinges
when
moved
in
the
most
dismal
manner
as
i
lay
upon
my
bed
i
could
hear
kaweah
occasionally
stamp
the
snoring
of
the
chinaman
on
one
side
and
the
low
mumbled
conversation
of
my
host
and
his
squaw
on
the
other
i
felt
no
inclination
to
sleep
but
lay
there
in
quite
conscious
yet
withdrawn
from
the
present
i
think
it
must
have
been
about
eleven
o
clock
when
i
heard
the
clatter
of
a
couple
of
horsemen
who
galloped
up
to
my
host
s
building
and
sprang
to
the
ground
their
spanish
spurs
ringing
on
the
stone
i
sat
up
in
bed
grasped
my
pistol
and
listened
the
next
my
window
rustled
the
horses
moved
about
so
restlessly
that
i
heard
but
little
of
the
conversation
but
that
little
i
found
of
personal
interest
to
myself
i
give
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
the
fragments
of
dialogue
between
my
host
and
the
man
whom
i
recognized
as
the
older
of
my
two
robbers
when
did
he
come
wall
the
sun
might
have
been
about
four
has
his
horse
give
out
i
failed
to
hear
the
answer
but
was
tempted
to
shout
out
no
gray
coat
buckskin
my
dress
going
to
mariposa
at
seven
in
the
i
guess
i
wouldn
t
round
a
low
muttered
soliloquy
in
spanish
wound
up
with
a
growl
no
antone
not
within
a
mile
of
the
place
sta
out
of
the
compressed
jumble
of
the
final
sentence
i
got
but
the
one
word
the
spaniards
mounted
and
the
sound
of
their
spurs
and
horses
hoofs
soon
died
away
in
the
north
and
i
lay
for
half
an
hour
revolving
all
sorts
of
plans
the
safest
course
seemed
to
be
to
slip
out
in
the
darkness
and
fly
on
foot
to
the
mountains
abandoning
my
good
kaweah
but
i
thought
of
his
noble
run
and
it
seemed
to
me
so
wrong
to
turn
my
back
on
him
that
i
resolved
to
unite
our
fate
i
rose
cautiously
and
holding
my
watch
up
to
the
moon
found
that
twelve
o
clock
had
just
passed
then
taking
from
my
pocket
a
gold
piece
i
laid
it
upon
the
stand
by
my
bed
and
in
my
stocking
feet
with
my
clothes
in
my
hand
started
noiselessly
for
the
corral
a
fierce
which
had
shown
no
disposition
to
make
friends
with
me
bounded
from
the
open
door
of
the
proprietor
to
my
side
instead
of
tearing
me
as
i
had
expected
he
licked
my
hands
and
fawned
about
my
feet
reaching
the
corral
gate
i
dreaded
opening
it
at
once
remembering
the
rusty
hinges
so
i
hung
my
clothes
upon
an
upper
bar
of
the
fence
and
cautiously
lifting
the
latch
began
to
push
back
the
gate
inch
by
inch
an
operation
which
required
eight
or
ten
minutes
then
i
walked
up
to
kaweah
and
patted
him
his
manger
was
empty
he
had
picked
up
the
last
kernel
of
barley
the
creature
s
manner
was
full
of
curiosity
as
if
he
had
never
been
approached
in
the
night
before
suppressing
his
ordinary
whinnying
he
preserved
a
motionless
silence
i
was
in
terror
lest
by
a
neigh
or
some
nervous
movement
he
should
waken
the
sleeping
proprietor
and
expose
my
plan
the
corral
and
the
open
square
were
half
covered
with
loose
stones
and
when
i
thought
of
the
clatter
of
kaweah
s
shoes
i
experienced
a
feeling
of
trouble
and
again
meditated
running
off
on
foot
until
the
idea
struck
me
of
muffling
the
iron
feet
ordinarily
kaweah
would
not
allow
me
to
lift
his
forefeet
at
all
the
two
blacksmiths
who
shod
him
had
done
so
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
and
whenever
i
had
attempted
to
pick
up
his
hind
feet
he
had
warned
me
away
by
dangerous
stamps
so
i
approached
him
very
timidly
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
allowed
me
to
lift
all
four
of
his
feet
without
the
slightest
objection
as
i
stooped
down
he
nosed
me
over
and
nibbled
playfully
at
my
hat
in
constant
dread
lest
he
should
make
some
noise
i
hurried
to
muffle
his
forefeet
with
my
trousers
and
shirt
and
then
with
rather
more
care
to
tie
upon
his
hind
feet
my
coat
and
drawers
knowing
nothing
of
the
country
ahead
of
me
and
fearing
that
i
might
again
have
to
run
for
it
i
determined
at
all
cost
to
water
him
groping
about
the
corral
and
barn
and
at
last
finding
a
bucket
and
descending
through
the
darkness
to
the
stream
i
brought
him
a
full
draught
which
he
swallowed
eagerly
when
i
tied
my
shoes
on
the
saddle
pommel
and
led
the
horse
slowly
out
of
the
corral
gate
holding
him
firmly
by
the
bit
and
feeling
his
nervous
breath
pour
out
upon
my
hand
when
we
had
walked
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
stopped
and
listened
all
was
quiet
the
landscape
lying
bright
and
distinct
in
full
moonlight
i
unbound
the
wrappings
shook
from
them
as
much
dust
as
possible
dressed
myself
and
then
mounting
started
northward
on
the
mariposa
trail
with
cocked
pistol
in
the
soft
dust
we
travelled
noiselessly
for
a
mile
or
so
passing
from
open
country
into
groves
of
oak
and
thickets
of
chaparral
without
warning
i
suddenly
came
upon
a
smouldering
fire
close
by
the
trail
and
in
the
shadow
descried
two
sleeping
forms
one
stretched
on
his
back
snoring
heavily
the
other
lying
upon
his
face
pillowing
his
head
upon
folded
arms
i
held
my
pistol
aimed
at
one
of
the
wretches
and
rode
by
without
wakening
them
guiding
kaweah
in
the
thickest
dust
it
keyed
me
up
to
a
high
pitch
i
turned
around
in
the
saddle
leaving
kaweah
to
follow
the
trail
and
kept
my
eyes
riveted
on
the
sleeping
forms
until
they
were
lost
in
distance
and
then
i
felt
safe
we
galloped
over
many
miles
of
trail
enjoying
a
sunrise
and
came
at
last
to
mariposa
where
i
deposited
my
gold
and
then
went
to
bed
and
made
up
my
lost
sleep
vii
around
yosemite
walls
late
in
the
afternoon
of
october
a
party
of
us
reached
the
edge
of
yosemite
and
looking
down
into
the
valley
saw
that
the
summer
haze
had
been
banished
from
the
region
by
autumnal
frosts
and
wind
we
looked
in
the
gulf
through
air
as
clear
as
a
vacuum
discerning
small
objects
upon
and
that
splendid
afternoon
shadow
which
divides
the
face
of
el
capitan
was
projected
far
up
and
across
the
valley
cutting
it
in
halves
one
a
mosaic
of
russets
and
yellows
with
dark
pine
and
glimpse
of
white
river
the
other
a
zone
in
which
the
familiar
groves
and
meadows
were
suffused
with
it
is
hard
to
conceive
a
more
pointed
contrast
than
this
same
view
in
october
and
june
then
through
a
slumberous
yet
transparent
atmosphere
you
look
down
upon
emerald
freshness
of
green
upon
arrowy
rush
of
swollen
river
and
here
and
there
along
pearly
cliffs
as
from
the
clouds
tumbles
white
silver
dust
of
cataracts
the
voice
of
full
soft
winds
swells
up
over
rustling
leaves
and
pulsating
throbs
like
the
beating
of
surf
all
stern
sublimity
all
geological
terribleness
are
veiled
away
behind
magic
curtains
of
and
broken
light
misty
brightness
glow
of
cliff
and
sparkle
of
foam
wealth
of
beautiful
details
the
charm
of
pearl
and
emerald
cool
gulfs
of
violet
shade
stretching
back
in
deep
recesses
of
the
walls
these
are
the
features
which
lie
under
the
june
sky
now
all
that
has
gone
the
shattered
fronts
of
walls
stand
out
sharp
and
terrible
sweeping
down
in
broken
crag
and
cliff
to
a
valley
whereon
the
shadow
of
autumnal
death
has
left
its
solemnity
there
is
no
longer
an
air
of
beauty
in
this
cold
naked
strength
one
has
crowded
on
him
the
geological
record
of
mountain
work
of
granite
plateau
suddenly
rent
asunder
of
the
slow
imperfect
manner
in
which
nature
has
vainly
striven
to
smooth
her
rough
work
and
bury
the
ruins
with
thousands
of
years
accumulation
of
soil
and
already
late
we
hurried
to
descend
the
trail
and
were
still
following
it
when
darkness
overtook
us
but
ourselves
and
the
animals
were
so
well
acquainted
with
every
turn
that
we
found
no
difficulty
in
continuing
our
way
to
longhurst
s
house
and
here
we
camped
for
the
night
by
an
act
of
congress
the
yosemite
valley
had
been
segregated
from
the
public
domain
and
given
donated
as
they
call
it
to
the
state
of
california
to
be
held
inalienable
for
all
time
as
a
public
the
commission
into
whose
hands
this
trust
devolved
had
sent
gardiner
and
myself
to
make
a
survey
defining
the
boundaries
of
the
new
grant
it
was
necessary
to
execute
this
work
before
the
legislature
should
meet
in
december
and
we
undertook
it
knowing
very
well
that
we
must
use
the
utmost
haste
in
order
to
escape
a
three
months
imprisonment
for
in
early
winter
the
immense
sierra
would
close
the
doors
of
mountain
trails
and
we
should
be
unable
to
reach
the
lowlands
until
the
following
spring
the
party
consisted
of
my
companion
gardiner
frederick
clark
who
had
been
detailed
from
the
service
of
the
mariposa
company
to
assist
us
longhurst
an
of
the
valley
a
whose
function
in
the
party
was
to
tell
yarns
sing
songs
and
feed
the
inner
man
cotter
and
wilmer
chainmen
and
two
mules
one
which
was
blind
and
the
other
which
i
aver
would
have
discharged
his
duty
very
much
better
without
eyes
we
had
chosen
as
the
of
the
survey
two
little
cabins
under
the
near
black
s
hotel
they
were
central
they
offered
a
shelter
and
from
their
doors
which
opened
almost
upon
the
merced
itself
we
obtained
a
most
delightful
sunrise
view
of
the
yosemite
next
morning
in
spite
of
early
outcries
from
longhurst
and
a
warning
solo
of
his
performed
with
spoon
and
we
lay
in
our
comfortable
blankets
pretending
to
enjoy
the
effect
of
sunrise
light
upon
the
yosemite
cliff
and
fall
all
of
us
unwilling
to
own
that
we
were
tired
out
and
needed
rest
breakfast
had
waited
an
hour
or
more
when
we
got
a
little
weary
of
beds
and
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
appetite
a
family
of
indians
consisting
of
two
huge
girls
and
their
parents
sat
silently
waiting
for
us
to
commence
and
after
we
had
begun
watched
every
mouthful
from
the
moment
we
got
it
successfully
impaled
upon
the
camp
forks
a
cloud
darkening
their
faces
as
it
disappeared
forever
down
our
throats
but
we
quite
lost
our
spectators
when
longhurst
came
upon
the
boards
as
a
a
to
which
he
bent
his
whole
intelligence
and
with
entire
success
scorning
such
vulgar
accomplishment
as
turning
the
cake
over
in
he
slung
it
boldly
up
turning
it
three
times
ostentatiously
greasing
the
pan
with
a
fine
centrifugal
movement
and
catching
the
flapjack
as
it
fluttered
down
and
spanked
it
upon
the
hot
coals
with
a
touch
at
once
graceful
and
masterly
i
failed
to
enjoy
these
products
feeling
as
if
i
were
breakfasting
in
sacrilege
upon
works
of
art
not
so
our
indian
friends
who
wrestled
affectionately
for
frequent
unfortunate
cakes
which
would
dodge
longhurst
and
fall
into
the
ashes
by
night
we
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
northern
wall
camping
at
the
of
a
small
brook
named
by
emotional
hutchings

believe
the
virgin

because
from
time
to
time
from
under
the
brow
of
a
cliff
just
south
of
el
capitan
there
may
be
seen
a
feeble

suspect
this
sentimental
pleasantry
is
intended
to
bear
some
relation
to
the
bridal
veil

opposite
if
it
has
any
such
force
at
all
it
is
a
melancholy
one
given
by
unusual
gauntness
and
an
aged
aspect
and
by
the
few
evanescent
tears

this
old
virgin
sheds

in

through

unusually
feathered
to

little
pools
surrounded
with
sphagnum

in
the
meadows
offering
pleasant
contrast
of
color
our

among
clumps
of
thick
firs
which
completely
walled
in
the

and
made
close
overhanging
shelters

and
beds

and
i
felt
thankful
to
our
thermometer
for
owning
up
frankly
the
chill
of
the
next
morning
as
we
left
a
generous
and
marched
off
through
fir
forest
and
among
brown
meadows
and
bare
ridges
of
rock
toward
el
capitan
this
grandest
of
granite
precipices
is
capped
by
a
sort
of
forehead
of
stone
sweeping
down
to
level
severe
brows
which
jut
out
a
few
feet
over
the
edge
a
few
and
black
pines
cling
in
clefts
contrasting
in
force
with
the
solid
white
stone
we
hung
our
barometer
upon
a
stunted
tree
quite
near
the
brink
and
climbing
cautiously
down
stretched
ourselves
out
upon
an
overhanging
block
of
granite
and
looked
over
into
the
yosemite
valley
the
rock
fell
under
us
in
one
sheer
sweep
of
hundred
feet
upon
its
face
we
could
trace
the
lines
of
fracture
and
all
prominent
lithological
changes
directly
beneath
outspread
like
a
delicately
tinted
chart
lay
the
lovely
park
of
yosemite
winding
in
and
out
about
the
solid
white
feet
of
precipices
which
sank
into
it
on
either
side
its
sunlit
surface
invaded
by
the
shadow
of
the
south
wall
its
spires
of
pine
open
expanses
of
buff
and
drab
meadow
and
families
of
umber
oaks
rising
as
background
for
the
vivid
green
and
flaming
orange
masses
of
frosted
cottonwood

deep
in
front
the
bridal
veil
brook
made
its
way
through
the
bottom
of
an
open
gorge
and
plunged
off
the
edge
of
a
cliff
falling
in
white
and
drifting
in
pale
translucent
clouds
out
over
the
of
the
valley
directly
opposite
us
and
forming
the
other
gatepost
of
the
valley
s
entrance
rose
the
great
mass
of
cathedral
rocks
a
group
quite
suggestive
of
the
florence
duomo
but
our
grandest
view
was
eastward
above
the
deep
sheltered
valley
and
over
the
tops
of
those
terrible
granite
walls
out
upon
rolling
ridges
of
stone
and
wonderful
granite
domes
nothing
in
the
whole
list
of
irruptive
products
except
volcanoes
themselves
is
so
wonderful
as
these
domed
mountains
they
are
of
every
variety
of
conoidal
form
having
horizontal
sections
accurately
elliptical
ovoid
or
circular
and
profiles
varying
from
such
as
the
cap
behind
the
sentinel
to
the
graceful
infinite
curves
of
the
north
dome
above
and
beyond
these
stretch
back
long
bare
ridges
connecting
with
sunny
summit
peaks
the
whole
region
is
one
solid
granite
mass
with
here
and
there
shallow
soil
layers
and
a
thin
variable
forest
which
grows
in
picturesque
mode
defining
the
leading
lines
of
erosion
as
an
artist
deepens
here
and
there
a
line
to
hint
at
some
structural
peculiarity
a
complete
physical
exposure
of
the
range
from
summit
to
base
lay
before
us
at
one
extreme
stand
sharpened
peaks
white
in
fretwork
of
glistening
icebank
or
black
where
tower
straight
bolts
of
snowless
rock
at
the
other
stretch
away
plains
smiling
with
a
broad
honest
brown
under
autumn
sunlight
they
are
not
quite
lovable
even
in
distant
tranquillity
of
hue
and
just
escape
being
interesting
in
spite
of
their
familiar
rivers
and
associated
belts
of
oaks
nothing
can
ever
render
them
quite
charming
for
in
the
startling
splendor
of
april
you
are
surfeited
with
an
embarrassment
of
beauty
at
all
other
times
stunned
by
their
poverty
not
so
the
summits
forever
new
full
of
individuality
rich
in
detail
and
coloring
themselves
anew
under
every
cloud
change
or
hue
of
heaven
they
lay
you
under
their
spell
from
them
the
eye
comes
back
over
granite
waves
and
domes
to
the
sharp
overhanging
yosemite
we
look
down
those
vast
hard
granite
fronts
cracked
and
splintered
scarred
and
stained
down
over
gorges
crammed
with
or
dark
with
files
of
climbing
pines
lower
the
are
wrapped
in
meadow
and
grove
and
beyond
level
and
sunlit
lies
the
floor
that
smooth
park
with
exquisite
perfection
of
finish
the
cap
of
capitan
is
formed
of
concentric
layers
like
the
peels
of
an
onion
each
one
about
two
or
three
feet
thick
upon
the
precipice
itself
either
from
our
station
on
an
overhanging
crevice
or
from
any
point
of
opposite
cliff
or
valley
bottom
this
structure
is
seen
to
be
superficial
never
descending
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
returning
to
camp
we
followed
a
main
ridge
smooth
and
white
under
foot
but
shaded
by
groves
of
alpine
firs
trees
which
here
reach
mature
stature
and
in
apparent
health
stand
rooted
in
white
gravel
resulting
from
surface
decomposition
i
am
sure
their
foliage
is
darker
than
can
be
accounted
for
by
effect
of
white
contrasting
earth
wherever
in
deep
depressions
enough
wash
soil
and
vegetable
mould
have
accumulated
there
the
trees
gather
in
thicker
groups
lift
themselves
higher
spread
out
more
and
branches
sometimes
however
richness
of
soil
and
perfection
of
condition
prove
fatal
through
overcrowding
they
are
wonderfully
like
human
communities
one
may
trace
in
an
hour
s
walk
nearly
all
the
laws
which
govern
the
physical
life
of
men
upon
reaching
camp
we
found
longhurst
in
a
deep
religious
calm
happy
in
his
mind
happy
too
in
the
posture
of
his
body
which
was
reclining
at
ease
upon
a
comfortable
before
the
fire
a
verse
of
the
hymn
coronation
escaped
murmurously
from
his
lips
rising
at
times
in
shaky
crescendos
accompanied
by
a
waving
and
desultory
movement
of
the
forefinger
he
had
found
among
our
medicines
a
black
bottle
of
brandy
contrived
to
induce
a
mule
to
break
it
and
just
to
save
as
much
as
possible
while
it
was
leaking
drank
with
freedom
anticipating
any
possible
displeasure
of
ours
longhurst
had
collected
his
wits
and
arrived
at
a
most
excellent
dinner
crowning
the
repast
with
a
duff
accurately
globular
neatly
brecciated
with
abundant
raisins
and
drowned
with
a
foaming
sauce
to
which
the
last
of
the
brandy
imparted
an
almost
pathetic
flavor
the
evening
closed
with
moral
remark
and
spiritual
song
from
longhurst
and
the
morning
introduced
us
to
our
prosaic
labor
of
running
the
boundary
line
a
task
which
consumed
several
weeks
and
occupied
nearly
all
of
our
days
i
once
or
twice
found
time
to
go
down
to
the
again
for
the
purpose
of
making
my
geological
studies
an
excursion
which
cotter
and
i
made
to
the
top
of
the
three
brothers
proved
of
interest
a
s
walk
from
camp
over
rolling
granite
country
brought
us
to
a
ridge
which
jutted
boldly
out
from
the
plateau
to
the
edge
of
the
yosemite
wall
upon
the
southern
side
of
this
eminence
heads
a
broad
ravine
which
descends
to
the
valley
bottom
upon
the
other
side
the
ridge
sends
down
its
waters
along
a
steep
declivity
into
a
lovely
mountain
basin
where
surrounded
by
forest
spreads
out
a
level
expanse
of
emerald
meadow
with
a
bit
of
blue
lakelet
in
the
midst
the
outlet
of
this
little
valley
is
through
a
narrow
rift
in
the
rocks
leading
down
into
the
yosemite
fall
along
the
crest
of
our
jutting
ridge
we
found
smooth
pathway
and
soon
reached
the
summit
here
again
we
were
upon
the
verge
of
a
precipice
this
time
four
thousand
two
hundred
feet
high
beneath
us
the
whole
upper
half
of
the
valley
was
as
clearly
seen
as
the
southern
half
had
been
from
capitan
the
sinuosities
of
the
merced
those
narrow
silvery
gleams
which
indicated
the
channel
of
the
yosemite
creek
the
broad
expanse
of
meadow
and
trains
which
had
bounded
down
the
sentinel
slope
were
all
laid
out
under
us
though
diminished
by
immense
depth
the
loftiest
and
most
magnificent
parts
of
the
walls
crowded
in
a
in
front
of
us
above
them
the
domes
lifted
even
higher
than
ourselves
swept
down
to
the
directly
to
our
left
we
overlooked
the
recess
into
which
the
yosemite
tumbles
and
could
see
the
white
torrent
leap
through
its
granite
lip
disappearing
a
thousand
feet
below
hidden
from
our
view
by
projecting
crags
its
roar
floating
up
to
us
now
resounding
loudly
and
again
dying
off
in
faint
reverberations
like
the
sounding
of
the
sea
looking
up
upon
the
falls
from
the
valley
below
one
utterly
fails
to
realize
the
great
depth
of
the
alcove
into
which
they
descend
looking
back
at
el
capitan
its
sharp
vertical
front
was
projected
against
far
blue
the
creamy
whiteness
of
sunlit
granite
cut
upon
aërial
distance
clouds
and
cold
blue
sky
shutting
down
over
white
crest
and
jetty
which
gather
upon
its
upper
dome
perspective
effects
are
marvellously
brought
out
by
the
stern
powerful
reality
of
such
rock
bodies
as
capitan
across
their
terrible
you
look
on
and
down
over
vistas
of
cañon
and
green
hillswells
the
dark
color
of
pine
and
fir
broken
by
bare
spots
of
harmonious
red
or
brown
and
changing
with
distance
into
purple
then
blue
which
reaches
on
farther
into
the
brown
monotonous
plains
beyond
where
the
earth
s
curve
defines
its
horizon
dim
serrations
of
coast
range
loom
indistinctly
on
the
hazy
air
from
here
those
remarkable
fracture
results
the
royal
arches
a
series
of
recesses
carved
into
the
granite
front
beneath
the
north
dome
are
seen
in
their
true
proportions
the
concentric
structure
which
covers
the
dome
with
a
series
of
plates
penetrates
to
a
greater
depth
than
usual
the
arches
themselves
are
only
fractured
edges
of
these
plates
resulting
from
the
intersection
of
a
with
the
conoidal
shells
we
had
seen
the
merced
group
of
heretofore
from
the
west
but
now
gained
a
more
oblique
view
which
began
to
bring
out
the
thin
of
mount
clark
a
shape
of
great
interest
from
its
marvellous
thinness
mount
starr
king
too
swelled
up
to
its
commanding
height
the
most
elevated
of
the
domes
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
i
was
constantly
impressed
with
the
inclination
of
the
walls
with
the
fact
that
they
are
never
vertical
for
any
great
depth
this
is
observed
too
remarkably
in
the
case
of
el
capitan
whose
apparently
vertical
profile
is
very
slant
the
actual
base
standing
twelve
hundred
feet
in
advance
of
the
brow
for
a
week
the
boundary
survey
was
continued
northeast
and
parallel
to
the
about
a
mile
back
from
its
brink
following
through
forests
and
crossing
granite
spurs
until
we
reached
the
summit
of
that
high
bare
chain
which
divides
the
virgin
s
tears
from
yosemite
creek
and
which
projecting
southward
ends
in
the
three
brothers
east
of
this
the
declivity
falls
so
rapidly
to
the
valley
of
the
upper
yosemite
creek
that
chaining
was
impossible
and
we
were
obliged
to
throw
our
line
across
the
cañon
a
little
over
a
mile
by
triangulation
this
completed
we
resumed
it
on
the
north
dome
spur
transferring
our
camp
to
a
bit
of
alpine
meadow
south
of
the
mono
trail
and
but
a
short
distance
from
the
north
dome
itself
after
the
line
was
finished
here
and
a
system
of
triangles
determined
by
which
we
connected
our
northern
points
with
those
across
the
chasm
of
the
yosemite
we
made
several
geological
excursions
along
the
cliffs
studying
the
granite
structure
working
out
its
lithological
changes
and
devoting
ourselves
especially
to
the
system
of
moraines
and
glacier
marks
which
indicate
direction
and
volume
of
the
old
an
excursion
to
the
summit
of
the
north
dome
was
exceedingly
interesting
from
the
rear
of
our
camp
we
entered
immediately
a
dense
forest
of
conifers
which
stretched
southward
along
the
summit
of
the
ridge
until
solid
granite
arresting
erosion
afforded
but
little
foothold
as
usual
among
the
cracks
and
clinging
around
the
bases
of
bowlders
a
few
hardy
pines
manage
to
live
almost
to
thrive
but
as
we
walked
groups
became
scarcer
trees
less
healthy
all
at
last
giving
way
to
bare
solid
stone
the
north
dome
itself
which
is
easily
reached
affords
an
impressive
view
up
the
illilluette
and
across
upon
the
fissured
front
of
the
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
interesting
specimens
of
conoidal
structure
since
not
only
is
its
mass
divided
by
large
spherical
shells
but
each
of
these
is
subdivided
by
a
number
of
lesser
divisional
planes
no
lithological
change
is
however
noticeable
between
the
different
shells
the
granite
is
composed
chiefly
of
orthoclase
transparent
vitreous
quartz
and
about
an
equal
proportion
of
black
mica
and
hornblende
here
and
there
adularia
occurs
and
very
sparingly
albite
with
no
difficulty
but
some
actual
danger
i
climbed
down
a
smooth
granite
to
where
the
precipice
of
royal
arches
makes
off
and
where
lying
upon
a
sharp
neatly
fractured
edge
i
was
able
to
look
down
and
study
those
purple
markings
which
are
vertically
striped
upon
so
many
of
these
granite
cliffs
i
found
them
to
be
bands
of
lichen
growth
which
follow
the
curves
of
occasional
during
any
great
and
when
snow
upon
the
uplands
is
suddenly
melted
innumerable
streams
many
of
them
of
considerable
volume
find
their
way
to
the
and
pour
down
its
front
wherever
this
is
the
case
a
deep
purple
lichen
spreads
itself
upon
the
granite
and
forms
those
dark
cloudings
which
add
so
greatly
to
the
variety
and
interest
of
the
cliffs
i
found
it
extremest
pleasure
to
lie
there
alone
on
the
dizzy
brink
studying
the
fine
sculpture
of
cliff
and
crag
overlooking
the
arrangement
of
piles
and
watching
that
slow
grand
growth
of
afternoon
shadows
sunset
found
me
there
still
disinclined
to
stir
and
repaid
my
laziness
by
a
glorious
spectacle
of
color
at
this
hour
there
is
no
more
splendid
contrast
of
light
and
shade
than
one
sees
upon
the
western
gateway
itself
capitan
upon
one
side
profiled
against
the
sunset
sky
and
the
yellow
mass
of
cathedral
rocks
rising
opposite
in
full
light
while
the
valley
is
divided
equally
between
sunshine
and
shade
pine
groves
and
oaks
almost
black
in
the
shadow
are
brightened
up
to
clear
where
they
pass
out
upon
the
lighted
plain
the
merced
upon
its
expanses
here
reflects
deep
blue
from
capitan
and
there
the
warm
cathedral
gold
the
last
sunlight
reflected
from
some
curious
smooth
surfaces
upon
rocks
east
of
the
sentinel
and
about
a
thousand
feet
above
the
valley
i
at
once
suspected
them
to
be
glacier
marks
and
booked
them
for
further
observation
my
next
excursion
was
up
to
mount
hoffmann
among
a
group
of
whose
drainage
gathers
at
last
through
lakes
and
brooklets
to
a
single
brook
the
yosemite
and
flows
twelve
miles
in
a
broad
arc
to
its
plunge
over
into
the
valley
from
the
summit
which
is
of
a
remarkably
bedded
conoidal
mass
of
granite
sharply
cut
down
in
precipices
fronting
the
north
is
obtained
a
broad
commanding
view
of
the
sierras
from
afar
by
the
heads
of
several
san
joaquin
branches
up
to
the
ragged
volcanic
piles
about
silver
mountain
from
the
top
i
climbed
along
slopes
and
down
by
a
wide
among
frozen
and
many
little
basins
of
transparent
blue
water
amid
black
shapes
of
stunted
fir
and
over
the
confused
wreck
of
rock
and
thrown
rudely
in
piles
by
avalanches
whose
tracks
were
fresh
enough
to
be
of
interest
upon
reaching
the
bottom
of
a
broad
open
through
whose
middle
flows
the
yosemite
creek
and
its
branches
i
was
surprised
to
find
the
streams
nearly
all
dry
that
the
snow
itself
under
influence
of
cold
was
a
solid
ice
mass
and
the
yosemite
creek
even
after
i
had
followed
it
down
for
miles
had
entirely
ceased
to
flow
at
intervals
the
course
of
the
stream
was
carried
over
slopes
of
granite
ending
almost
uniformly
in
shallow
rock
basins
where
were
considerable
ponds
of
water
in
one
or
two
instances
expanding
to
the
dignity
of
lakelets
the
valley
describes
an
arc
whose
convexity
is
in
the
main
turned
to
the
west
the
stream
running
nearly
due
west
for
about
four
miles
turning
gradually
to
the
southward
and
having
crossed
the
mono
trail
bending
again
to
the
southeast
after
which
it
discharges
over
the
verge
of
the
cliff
an
average
breadth
of
this
valley
is
about
half
a
mile
its
form
a
shallow
elliptical
trough
rendered
unusually
smooth
by
the
erosive
action
of
old
glaciers
break
its
surface
here
and
there
but
in
general
the
granite
has
been
planed
down
into
remarkable
smoothness
all
along
its
course
a
varying
rubbish
of
angular
bowlders
has
been
left
by
the
retiring
ice
whose
material
like
that
of
the
whole
country
is
of
granite
but
i
recognized
prominently
black
sienitic
granite
from
the
summit
of
mount
hoffmann
which
from
superior
hardness
has
withstood
disintegration
and
is
perhaps
the
most
frequent
material
of
the
surface
modelling
is
often
of
the
most
finished
type
especially
is
this
the
case
wherever
the
granite
is
highly
silicious
its
polish
becoming
then
as
brilliant
as
a
marble
mantel
in
very
feldspathic
portions
and
particularly
where
orthoclase
predominates
the
polished
surface
becomes
a
crust
usually
about
of
an
inch
thick
in
which
the
ordinary
appearance
of
the
minerals
has
been
somewhat
changed
the
by
long
pressure
rendered
extremely
dense
and
in
a
measure
separated
from
the
underlying
material
this
smooth
crust
is
constantly
breaking
off
in
broad
flakes
the
polishing
extended
up
the
valley
sides
to
a
height
of
about
seven
hundred
feet
the
average
section
of
the
old
glacier
was
perhaps
six
hundred
feet
thick
by
half
a
mile
in
width
i
followed
its
course
from
mount
hoffmann
down
as
far
as
i
could
ride
and
then
tying
my
horse
only
a
little
way
from
the
brink
of
the
cliff
i
continued
downward
on
foot
walking
upon
the
dry
i
found
here
and
there
a
deep
sometimes
twenty
feet
deep
carved
in
and
often
full
of
water
just
before
reaching
the
cliff
verge
the
stream
enters
a
narrow
sharp
cut
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
in
depth
and
probably
not
over
thirty
feet
wide
the
bottom
and
sides
of
this
granite
lip
here
and
there
are
evidently
but
the
greater
part
of
the
scorings
have
been
worn
away
by
the
attrition
of
sands
a
peculiar
brilliant
polish
which
may
be
seen
there
is
wholly
the
result
of
recent
sand
friction
it
was
noon
when
i
reached
the
actual
lip
and
crept
with
extreme
caution
down
over
smooth
rounded
granite
between
towering
walls
to
where
the
yosemite
fall
makes
its
wonderful
leap
polished
rock
curved
over
too
dangerously
for
me
to
lean
out
and
look
down
over
the
itself
a
stone
gate
dazzlingly
gilded
with
sunlight
formed
the
frame
through
which
i
looked
down
upon
that
lovely
valley
contrast
with
the
strength
of
yellow
rock
and
severe
adamantine
sculpture
threw
over
the
landscape
beyond
a
strange
unreality
a
soft
aërial
depth
of
purple
tone
quite
as
new
to
me
as
it
was
beautiful
beyond
description
there
hundred
feet
below
lay
meadow
and
river
oak
and
pine
and
a
broad
cast
by
the
opposite
wall
over
it
all
even
through
the
dark
sky
overhead
there
seemed
to
be
poured
some
absolute
color
some
purple
air
hiding
details
and
veiling
with
its
soft
amethystine
obscurity
all
that
hard
broken
roughness
of
the
sentinel
cliffs
in
this
strange
vacant
stone
corridor
this
pathway
for
the
great
yosemite
torrent
this
of
thunderous
tumult
it
was
a
strange
sensation
to
stand
looking
in
vain
for
a
drop
of
water
listening
vainly
too
for
the
faintest
whisper
of
sound
and
i
found
myself
constantly
expecting
some
sign
of
the
returning
flood
from
the
lip
i
climbed
a
high
point
just
to
the
east
getting
a
grand
view
down
the
cliff
where
a
broad
purple
band
defined
the
yosemite
spray
line
there
too
i
found
unmistakable
showing
that
the
glacier
of
mount
hoffmann
had
actually
poured
over
the
brink
at
the
moments
of
such
discovery
one
can
not
help
restoring
in
imagination
pictures
of
the
past
when
we
stand
by
or
meadow
of
that
fair
valley
looking
up
at
the
torrent
falling
bright
under
fulness
of
light
and
lovely
in
its
graceful
airiness
we
are
apt
to
feel
its
enchantment
but
how
immeasurably
grander
must
it
have
been
when
the
great
living
moving
glacier
with
slow
invisible
motion
crowded
its
huge
body
over
the
brink
and
launched
blue
down
through
the
foam
of
the
cataract
into
that
gulf
of
wild
rocks
and
eddying
mist
the
mule
bonaparte
i
found
tied
where
i
had
left
him
and
as
usual
i
approached
him
upon
his
blind
side
able
thus
to
get
successfully
into
my
saddle
without
danger
to
life
or
limb
i
could
never
become
attached
to
the
creature
although
he
carried
me
faithfully
many
difficult
and
some
dangerous
miles
and
for
the
reason
that
he
made
a
pretext
of
his
to
commit
excesses
such
as
crowding
me
against
trees
and
refusing
to
follow
trails
realizing
how
terrible
under
reinforcement
of
hereditary
transmission
the
peculiarly
mulish
traits
would
have
become
one
is
more
than
thankful
to
nature
for
depriving
this
singular
hybrid
of
the
capacity
of
handing
them
down
rather
tired
and
not
a
little
bruised
by
untimely
collision
with
trees
i
succeeded
at
last
in
navigating
bonaparte
safely
to
camp
and
turning
him
over
to
his
fellow
pumpkinseed
the
nights
were
already
very
cold
our
beds
on
frozen
ground
none
of
the
most
comfortable
in
fact
enthusiasm
had
quite
as
much
to
do
with
our
content
as
the
blankets
or
longhurst
s
culinary
art
which
enclosed
now
by
the
narrow
limit
of
bacon
bread
and
beans
failed
to
produce
such
dainties
as
slapjacks
or
of
solemnizing
memory
one
more
geological
trip
finished
my
examination
of
this
side
of
the
great
valley
it
was
a
two
days
ramble
all
over
the
granite
ridges
from
the
north
dome
up
to
lake
tenaya
during
which
i
gathered
ample
evidence
that
a
broad
sheet
of
glacier
partly
derived
from
mount
hoffmann
and
in
part
from
the
mount
watkins
ridge
and
cathedral
peak
but
mainly
from
the
great
tuolumne
glacier
gathered
and
flowed
down
into
the
yosemite
valley
where
it
moved
over
the
cliffs
there
are
scarrings
the
facts
which
attest
this
are
open
to
observation
and
seem
to
me
important
in
making
up
a
statement
of
past
conditions
we
were
glad
to
get
back
at
last
to
our
two
little
cabins
in
the
valley
although
our
the
diggers
were
gone
and
the
great
fall
was
dry
a
rest
of
one
day
proved
refreshing
enough
for
us
to
leave
camp
and
ascend
by
the
mariposa
trail
to
meadow
brook
where
we
made
a
bivouac
from
which
gardiner
began
his
southern
boundary
line
and
i
renewed
my
geological
studies
east
of
inspiration
point
i
always
go
swiftly
by
this
famous
point
of
view
now
feeling
somehow
that
i
don
t
belong
to
that
army
of
literary
travellers
who
have
here
planted
themselves
and
burst
into
rhetoric
here
all
who
make
california
books
down
to
the
last
and
most
sentimental
specimen
who
so
much
as
meditates
a
letter
to
his
or
her
local
paper
dismount
and
inflate
if
those
firs
could
recite
half
the
droll
they
have
listened
to
or
if
i
dared
tell
half
the
delicious
points
i
treasure
it
would
sound
altogether
too
amusing
among
these
chapters
i
had
always
felt
a
desire
to
examine
bridal
veil
cañon
and
the
southwest
cathedral
slope
accordingly
one
fine
morning
i
set
out
alone
and
descended
through
chaparral
and
over
rough
slopes
to
the
stream
which
at
this
time
unlike
the
other
upland
brooks
flowed
freely
though
with
far
less
volume
than
in
summer
at
this
altitude
only
such
streams
as
derive
their
volume
wholly
from
melting
snow
dry
up
in
the
cold
autumnal
and
winter
months
brooks
hold
their
own
and
rather
increase
as
cold
weather
advances
it
was
a
wild
gorge
down
which
i
tramped
following
the
often
jumping
from
block
to
block
or
letting
myself
down
by
the
chaparral
boughs
that
overhung
my
way
splendid
walls
on
either
side
rose
steep
and
high
for
the
most
part
bare
but
here
and
there
on
shelf
or
crevice
bearing
clusters
of
fine
conifers
their
lower
slopes
one
vast
wreck
of
bowlders
and
thicket
of
chaparral
plants
not
without
some
difficulty
i
at
length
got
to
the
brink
and
sat
down
to
rest
looking
over
at
the
valley
whose
meadows
were
only
a
thousand
feet
below
a
cool
stirring
breeze
blew
up
the
merced
cañon
swinging
the
scarf
of
foam
which
fell
from
my
feet
and
floating
now
against
the
purple
cliff
again
blew
out
gracefully
to
the
right
or
left
while
i
looked
a
gust
came
roaming
round
the
cathedral
rocks
impinging
against
our
cliff
near
the
fall
and
apparently
got
in
between
it
and
the
cliff
carrying
the
whole
column
of
falling
water
straight
out
in
a
streamer
through
the
air
i
went
back
to
camp
by
way
of
the
cathedral
rocks
finding
much
of
interest
in
the
conoidal
structure
which
is
yet
perfectly
apparent
and
unobscured
by
erosion
or
the
terrible
splitting
asunder
they
have
suffered
upon
a
ridge
connecting
these
rocks
with
the
plateaus
just
south
there
were
many
instructive
and
delightful
points
of
view
especially
the
crag
just
above
the
cathedral
spires
from
which
i
overlooked
a
large
part
of
valley
and
cliff
with
the
two
sharp
slender
minarets
of
granite
close
beneath
me
that
great
block
forming
the
plateau
between
the
yosemite
and
illilluette
cañons
afforded
a
fine
field
for
studying
granite
pine
and
many
remarkably
characteristic
views
of
the
gorge
below
and
peaks
beyond
from
our
camp
i
explored
every
ravine
and
climbed
each
eminence
reaching
at
last
one
fine
afternoon
the
top
of
that
singular
hemispherical
mass
the
sentinel
dome
from
this
point
one
sweeps
the
horizon
in
all
directions
you
stand
upon
the
crest
of
half
a
globe
whose
smooth
white
sides
bearing
here
and
there
stunted
pines
slope
away
regularly
in
all
directions
from
your
feet
below
granite
masses
blackened
here
and
there
with
densely
clustered
forest
stretch
through
varied
undulations
toward
you
at
a
little
distance
from
the
foot
of
the
trees
hold
upon
sharp
brinks
and
precipices
plunge
off
into
yosemite
upon
one
side
and
the
dark
rocky
cañon
of
illilluette
upon
the
other
eastward
soaring
into
clouds
stands
the
thin
vertical
mass
of
the
from
this
view
the
snowy
peak
of
the
obelisk
flattened
into
broad
outline
rises
shutting
out
the
more
distant
sierra
summits
this
peak
from
its
peculiar
position
and
thin
form
offers
one
of
the
most
tempting
summits
of
the
region
from
that
slender
top
one
might
look
into
the
yosemite
and
into
that
basin
of
ice
and
granite
between
the
merced
and
mount
lyell
groups
i
had
longed
for
it
through
the
last
month
s
campaign
and
now
made
up
my
mind
with
this
inspiring
view
to
attempt
it
at
all
hazards
a
little
way
to
the
east
and
about
a
thousand
feet
below
the
brink
of
the
glacier
point
the
crags
appeared
to
me
particularly
tempting
so
in
the
late
afternoon
i
descended
walking
over
a
rough
gritty
surface
of
granite
which
gave
me
secure
foothold
upon
the
very
edge
the
immense
splintered
rocks
lay
piled
one
upon
another
here
a
mass
jutting
out
and
overhanging
upon
the
edge
and
here
a
huge
slab
pointed
out
like
a
barbette
gun
i
crawled
out
upon
one
of
these
projecting
blocks
and
rested
myself
while
studying
the
view
from
here
the
one
very
remarkable
object
is
the
you
see
it
now
edgewise
and
in
sharp
profile
the
upper
half
of
the
conoid
fronting
the
north
with
a
sharp
sheer
of
about
two
thousand
feet
vertical
from
the
top
of
this
a
most
graceful
helmet
curve
sweeps
over
to
the
south
and
descends
almost
perpendicularly
into
the
valley
of
the
little
yosemite
and
here
from
the
foot
springs
up
the
block
of
mount
broderick
a
single
pyramid
three
thousand
feet
from
summit
to
base
trimmed
upon
its
crest
with
a
few
pines
and
spreading
out
its
southern
base
into
a
precipice
over
which
plunges
the
white
nevada
torrent
observation
had
taught
me
that
a
glacier
flowed
over
the
yosemite
brink
as
i
looked
over
now
i
could
see
its
shallow
valley
and
the
rocks
over
which
it
crowded
itself
and
tumbled
into
the
icy
valley
below
up
the
yosemite
gorge
which
opened
straight
before
me
i
knew
that
another
great
glacier
had
flowed
and
also
that
the
valley
of
the
illilluette
and
the
little
yosemite
had
been
the
bed
of
rivers
of
ice
a
study
too
of
the
markings
upon
the
glacier
cliff
above
hutchings
s
house
had
convinced
me
that
a
glacier
no
less
than
a
thousand
feet
deep
had
flowed
through
the
valley
occupying
its
entire
bottom
it
was
impossible
for
me
as
i
sat
perched
upon
this
jutting
rock
mass
in
full
view
of
all
the
cañons
which
had
led
into
this
wonderful
converging
system
of
not
to
imagine
a
picture
of
the
glacier
period
bare
or
cliffs
overhung
the
gulf
streams
of
ice
here
smooth
and
compacted
into
a
white
plain
there
riven
into
innumerable
crevasses
or
tossed
into
forms
like
the
waves
of
a
sea
crawled
through
all
the
gorges
torrents
of
water
and
avalanches
of
rock
and
snow
spouted
at
intervals
all
along
the
cliff
walls
not
a
tree
nor
a
vestige
of
life
was
in
sight
except
far
away
upon
ridges
below
or
out
upon
the
dimly
expanding
plain
granite
and
ice
and
snow
silence
broken
only
by
the
howling
tempest
and
the
crash
of
falling
ice
or
splintered
rock
and
a
sky
deep
freighted
with
cloud
and
storm
these
were
the
elements
of
a
period
which
lasted
immeasurably
long
and
only
in
comparatively
the
most
recent
geological
times
have
given
way
to
the
present
marvellously
changed
condition
nature
in
her
present
aspects
as
well
as
in
the
records
of
her
past
here
constantly
offers
the
most
vivid
and
terrible
contrasts
can
anything
be
more
wonderfully
opposite
than
that
period
of
leaden
sky
gray
granite
and
desolate
stretches
of
white
and
the
present
when
of
the
old
order
we
have
only
left
the
solid
framework
of
granite
and
the
indelible
inscriptions
of
glacier
work
their
burnished
pathways
are
legibly
traced
with
the
history
of
the
past
every
is
represented
by
a
feeble
river
every
great
glacier
cascade
by
a
torrent
of
white
foam
dashing
itself
down
rugged
walls
or
spouting
from
the
brinks
of
upright
cliffs
the
very
avalanche
tracks
are
darkened
by
clustered
woods
and
over
the
level
pathway
of
the
great
yosemite
glacier
itself
is
spread
a
park
of
green
a
mosaic
of
forest
a
thread
of
river
viii
a
sierra
storm
from
every
commanding
eminence
around
the
yosemite
no
distant
object
rises
with
more
inspiring
greatness
than
the
obelisk
of
mount
clark
seen
from
the
west
it
is
a
high
isolated
peak
having
a
outline
very
much
flattened
upon
its
west
side
the
precipice
sinking
deeply
down
to
an
old
glacier
ravine
from
the
north
this
peak
is
a
slender
single
needle
jutting
two
thousand
feet
from
a
pedestal
of
rocks
and
heights
rise
to
its
base
from
east
and
west
to
the
south
it
falls
into
a
deep
saddle
which
rises
again
after
a
level
outline
of
a
mile
sweeping
up
in
another
noble
granite
peak
on
the
north
the
spur
drops
abruptly
down
overhanging
an
edge
of
the
great
merced
gorge
its
base
buried
beneath
an
accumulation
of
morainal
matter
deposited
by
ancient
merced
glaciers
from
the
region
of
mount
hoffmann
looming
in
most
impressive
isolation
its
slender
summit
had
long
fired
us
with
ambition
and
having
finished
my
agreeable
climb
round
the
yosemite
walls
i
concluded
to
visit
the
mountain
with
cotter
and
if
the
weather
should
permit
to
attempt
a
climb
we
packed
our
two
mules
with
a
week
s
provisions
and
a
single
blanket
each
and
on
the
tenth
of
november
left
our
friends
at
the
s
camp
in
yosemite
valley
and
rode
out
upon
the
mariposa
trail
reaching
the
plateau
by
noon
having
passed
meadow
brook
we
left
the
path
and
bore
off
in
the
direction
of
mount
clark
spending
the
afternoon
in
riding
over
granite
ridges
and
open
stretches
of
frozen
meadow
where
the
ground
was
all
hard
and
the
grass
entirely
cropped
off
by
numerous
herds
of
sheep
that
had
ranged
here
during
the
summer
the
whole
earth
was
bare
and
rang
under
our
mules
hoofs
almost
as
clearly
as
the
granite
itself
we
camped
for
the
night
on
one
of
the
most
eastern
affluents
of
bridal
veil
creek
and
were
careful
to
fill
our
canteens
before
the
bitter
should
freeze
it
over
by
our
camp
was
a
pile
of
pine
logs
swept
together
by
some
former
tempest
we
lighted
them
and
were
quickly
saluted
by
a
magnificent
bonfire
the
animals
were
tied
within
its
ring
of
warmth
and
our
beds
laid
where
the
rain
of
sparks
could
not
reach
as
we
were
just
going
to
sleep
our
mules
pricked
up
their
ears
and
looked
into
the
forest
we
sprang
to
our
feet
picked
up
our
pistols
expecting
an
indian
or
a
grizzly
but
were
surprised
to
see
riding
out
of
the
darkness
a
lonely
mountaineer
mounted
upon
a
little
mustang
carrying
his
long
rifle
across
the
he
came
directly
to
our
and
without
uttering
a
word
slowly
and
with
great
effort
swung
himself
out
of
his
saddle
and
walked
close
to
the
flames
leaving
his
horse
which
remained
motionless
where
he
had
reined
him
in
i
saw
that
the
man
was
nearly
frozen
to
death
and
immediately
threw
my
blanket
over
his
shoulders
the
water
in
our
camp
kettle
was
still
hot
and
cotter
made
haste
to
draw
a
pot
of
tea
while
i
broiled
a
slice
of
beef
and
pressed
him
to
eat
he
however
shook
his
head
and
maintained
a
persistent
silence
until
at
length
after
turning
round
and
round
until
i
could
have
thought
him
done
to
a
turn
in
a
very
feeble
broken
voice
he
ejaculated
i
was
pretty
near
gone
in
stranger
again
i
pressed
him
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
but
he
feebly
answered
not
after
roasting
for
half
an
hour
in
which
i
fully
expected
to
see
his
smoke
he
sat
down
and
drank
about
two
quarts
of
tea
this
had
the
effect
of
thawing
him
out
and
he
remembered
that
his
horse
was
still
saddled
and
very
hungry
he
told
us
that
neither
he
nor
the
animal
had
had
anything
to
eat
for
three
days
and
that
he
was
pushing
hopelessly
westward
expecting
either
the
giving
out
of
his
horse
or
death
by
freezing
we
took
the
saddle
from
his
tired
little
mustang
spread
the
over
his
back
and
from
the
scanty
supply
of
grain
we
had
brought
for
our
own
animals
gave
him
a
tolerable
supper
it
is
wonderful
how
in
hours
of
danger
and
privation
the
horse
clings
to
his
human
friend
perfectly
tame
perfectly
trusting
he
throws
the
responsibility
of
his
care
and
life
upon
his
rider
and
it
is
not
the
least
pathetic
among
our
mountain
experiences
to
see
this
patient
confidence
continue
until
death
observing
that
the
logs
were
likely
to
burn
freely
all
night
we
divided
our
blankets
with
the
mountaineer
and
cotter
and
i
turned
in
together
in
the
morning
our
new
friend
had
entirely
recovered
from
his
numb
stupid
condition
recognizing
at
a
glance
his
whereabouts
and
thanking
us
feelingly
for
our
rough
hospitality
he
headed
toward
the
mariposa
trail
with
quite
an
affecting
after
breakfast
we
ourselves
mounted
and
rode
up
a
long
spur
leading
to
the
summit
of
a
granite
divide
which
we
crossed
at
a
narrow
pass
between
two
steep
cliffs
and
descended
its
eastern
slope
in
full
view
of
the
whole
merced
group
this
long
abrupt
descent
in
front
of
us
led
to
the
illilluette
creek
and
directly
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
rose
the
high
sharp
summit
of
mount
clark
we
were
all
day
in
crossing
and
riding
up
the
crest
of
a
sharply
curved
medial
moraine
which
traced
itself
from
the
mountain
south
of
mount
clark
in
a
long
parabolic
curve
dying
out
at
last
in
the
bottom
of
the
illilluette
basin
the
moraine
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
i
have
ever
seen
its
smooth
graded
summit
rose
as
regularly
as
a
railway
embankment
and
seemed
to
be
formed
altogether
of
irregular
bowlders
piled
securely
together
and
cemented
by
a
thick
deposit
of
granitic
late
in
the
afternoon
we
had
reached
its
head
where
the
two
converging
glaciers
of
mount
clark
and
mount
kyle
had
joined
clasping
a
rugged
promontory
of
granite
to
our
left
in
a
depression
of
the
basin
lay
a
little
patch
of
meadow
wholly
surrounded
by
dense
groups
of
alpine
trees
which
grew
in
clusters
of
five
and
six
apparently
from
one
root
a
little
stream
from
the
obelisk
snows
fell
in
a
series
of
shallow
cascades
by
the
meadow
s
margin
we
jumped
across
the
brook
and
went
into
camp
tethering
the
mules
close
by
us
one
of
the
great
charms
of
high
mountain
camps
is
their
very
domestic
nature
your
animals
are
picketed
close
by
the
kitchen
your
beds
are
between
the
two
and
the
water
and
the
wood
are
always
in
most
comfortable
apposition
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
a
mild
moist
wind
sprang
up
from
the
south
and
with
it
came
slowly
creeping
over
the
sky
a
dull
leaden
bank
of
cloud
since
april
we
had
had
no
storm
the
perpetually
cloudless
sky
had
banished
all
thought
almost
memory
of
foul
weather
but
winter
tempests
had
already
held
off
remarkably
and
we
knew
that
at
any
moment
they
might
set
in
and
in
hours
render
the
plateaus
impassable
it
was
with
some
anxiety
that
i
closed
my
eyes
that
night
and
sleeping
lightly
often
awoke
as
a
freshening
wind
moved
the
pines
at
dawn
we
were
up
and
observed
that
a
dark
heavy
mass
of
covered
the
whole
sky
and
had
settled
down
over
the
obelisk
wrapping
even
the
at
its
base
in
gray
folds
the
entire
peak
was
lost
except
now
and
then
when
the
torn
vapors
parted
for
a
few
moments
and
disclosed
its
sharp
summit
whitened
by
snow
a
strange
moan
filled
the
air
the
winds
howled
pitilessly
over
the
rocks
and
swept
in
deafening
blasts
through
the
pines
it
was
my
duty
to
saddle
up
directly
and
flee
for
the
yosemite
but
i
am
naturally
an
optimist
a
sort
of
geological
micawber
so
i
dodged
my
duty
and
determined
to
give
the
weather
every
opportunity
for
a
accordingly
we
remained
in
camp
all
day
studying
the
minerals
of
the
granite
as
the
thickly
strewn
bowlders
gave
us
material
at
nightfall
i
climbed
a
little
rise
back
of
our
meadow
and
looked
out
over
the
basin
of
illilluette
and
up
in
the
direction
of
the
obelisk
now
and
then
the
parting
clouds
opened
a
glimpse
of
the
mountain
and
occasionally
an
unusual
blast
of
wind
blew
away
the
deeply
settled
vapors
from
the
cañon
to
westward
but
each
time
they
closed
in
more
threateningly
and
before
i
descended
to
camp
the
whole
land
was
obscured
in
the
cloud
which
settled
densely
down
the
mules
had
made
themselves
comfortable
with
a
repast
of
rich
which
though
slightly
frosted
still
retained
much
of
their
original
juice
and
nutriment
we
ourselves
made
a
deep
inroad
on
the
supply
of
provisions
and
after
chatting
awhile
by
the
firelight
went
to
bed
taking
the
precaution
to
pile
our
effects
carefully
together
covering
them
with
an
blanket
our
bivouac
was
in
the
middle
of
a
cluster
of
firs
quite
well
protected
overhead
but
open
to
the
sudden
gusts
which
blew
roughly
hither
and
thither
by
nine
o
clock
the
wind
died
away
altogether
and
in
a
few
moments
a
thick
cloud
of
snow
was
falling
we
had
gone
to
bed
together
pulled
the
blankets
as
a
cover
over
our
heads
and
in
a
few
moments
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
once
or
twice
in
the
night
i
woke
with
a
slight
sense
of
suffocation
and
cautiously
lifted
the
blanket
over
my
head
but
each
time
found
it
growing
heavier
and
heavier
with
a
freight
of
snow
in
the
morning
we
awoke
quite
early
and
pushing
back
the
blanket
found
that
we
had
been
covered
by
about
a
foot
and
a
half
of
snow
the
poor
mules
had
approached
us
to
the
limit
of
their
rope
and
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
our
beds
anxiously
waiting
our
first
signs
of
life
we
hurried
to
breakfast
and
hastily
putting
on
the
saddles
and
wrapping
ourselves
from
head
to
foot
in
our
blankets
mounted
and
started
for
the
crest
of
the
moraine
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
make
a
little
in
my
with
the
compass
directions
of
our
march
from
the
yosemite
and
we
had
now
the
difficult
task
of
retracing
our
steps
in
a
storm
so
blinding
and
fierce
that
we
could
never
see
more
than
a
rod
in
advance
but
for
the
regular
form
of
the
moraine
with
whose
curve
we
were
already
familiar
i
fear
we
must
have
lost
our
way
in
the
real
labyrinth
of
glaciated
rocks
which
covered
the
whole
illilluette
basin
snow
blew
in
every
direction
filling
our
eyes
and
blinding
the
poor
mules
who
often
turned
quickly
from
some
sudden
gust
and
refused
to
go
on
it
was
a
cruel
necessity
but
we
spurred
them
inexorably
forward
guiding
them
to
the
right
and
left
to
avoid
rocks
and
trees
which
in
their
blindness
they
were
constantly
threatening
to
strike
warmly
rolled
in
our
blankets
we
suffered
little
from
cold
but
the
driving
sleet
and
hail
very
soon
bruised
our
cheeks
and
eyelids
most
painfully
it
required
real
effort
of
will
to
face
the
storm
and
we
very
soon
learned
to
take
turns
in
breaking
trail
the
snow
constantly
balled
upon
our
animals
feet
and
they
slid
in
every
direction
now
and
then
in
descending
a
sharp
slope
of
granite
the
poor
creatures
would
get
sliding
and
rush
to
the
bottom
their
legs
stiffened
out
and
their
heads
thrust
forward
in
fear
after
crossing
the
illilluette
which
we
did
at
our
old
ford
we
found
it
very
difficult
to
climb
the
long
steep
hillside
for
the
mules
were
quite
unable
to
carry
us
obliging
us
to
lead
them
and
to
throw
ourselves
upon
the
to
break
a
pathway
this
slope
almost
wore
us
out
and
when
at
last
we
reached
its
summit
we
threw
ourselves
upon
the
snow
for
a
rest
but
were
in
such
a
profuse
perspiration
that
i
deemed
it
unsafe
to
lie
there
for
a
moment
and
getting
up
again
we
mounted
the
mules
and
rode
slowly
on
toward
open
plateaus
near
great
meadows
the
snow
gradually
decreased
in
depth
as
we
descended
upon
the
plain
directly
south
of
the
yosemite
the
wind
abated
somewhat
and
there
were
only
occasional
snow
flurries
between
of
tolerable
comfort
constant
use
of
the
compass
and
reference
to
my
little
map
at
length
brought
us
to
the
mariposa
trail
but
not
until
after
eight
hours
of
anxious
exhaustive
labor
anxious
from
the
constant
dread
of
losing
our
way
in
the
blinding
confusion
of
storm
exhausting
for
we
had
more
than
half
of
the
way
acted
as
dragging
our
frightened
and
tired
brutes
after
us
the
poor
creatures
instantly
recognized
the
trail
and
started
in
a
brisk
trot
toward
inspiration
point
suddenly
an
icy
wind
swept
up
the
valley
carrying
with
it
a
storm
of
snow
and
hail
the
wind
blew
with
such
violence
that
the
whole
freight
of
sleet
and
ice
was
carried
horizontally
with
fearful
swiftness
cutting
the
bruised
faces
of
the
mules
and
giving
our
own
eyelids
exquisite
torture
the
brutes
refused
to
carry
us
farther
we
were
obliged
to
dismount
and
drive
them
before
us
beating
them
constantly
with
clubs
fighting
our
way
against
this
bitter
blast
by
hard
we
at
last
gave
up
and
took
refuge
in
a
dense
clump
of
firs
which
crown
the
spur
by
inspiration
point
our
poor
mules
cowered
under
shelter
with
us
and
turned
tail
to
the
storm
the
were
solid
cones
of
snow
which
now
and
then
unloaded
themselves
when
severely
bent
by
a
sudden
gust
half
burying
us
in
dry
white
powder
wind
roared
below
us
in
the
yosemite
gorge
it
blew
from
the
west
rolling
up
in
waves
which
smote
the
cliffs
and
surged
on
up
the
valley
while
we
sat
still
the
drifts
began
to
pile
up
at
our
backs
the
mules
were
and
our
situation
began
to
be
serious
looking
over
the
we
saw
but
the
hurrying
snow
and
only
heard
a
confused
tumult
of
wind
a
steady
increase
in
the
severity
of
the
gale
made
us
fear
that
the
trees
might
crash
down
over
us
so
we
left
the
mules
and
crept
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
ensconced
ourselves
in
a
sheltered
nook
protected
by
walls
of
rock
which
rose
at
our
back
we
were
on
the
brink
of
the
yosemite
and
but
for
snow
might
have
looked
down
three
thousand
feet
the
storm
eddied
below
us
sucking
down
whirlwinds
of
snow
and
sometimes
opening
deep
rifts
never
enough
however
to
disclose
more
than
a
few
hundred
feet
of
cliffs
we
had
been
in
this
position
about
an
hour
half
frozen
and
soaked
through
when
i
at
length
gathered
conscience
enough
to
climb
back
and
take
a
look
at
our
brutes
the
forlorn
pair
were
frosted
over
with
a
thick
coating
their
pitiful
eyes
staring
eagerly
at
me
i
had
half
a
mind
to
turn
them
loose
but
considering
that
their
obstinate
nature
might
lead
them
back
to
our
obelisk
camp
i
patted
their
noses
and
climbed
back
to
the
shelf
by
cotter
determined
to
try
it
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
when
if
the
tempest
did
not
lull
i
thought
we
must
press
on
and
face
the
snow
for
an
hour
more
while
we
tramped
down
to
the
valley
suddenly
there
came
a
lull
in
the
storm
its
blinding
fury
of
snow
and
wind
ceased
overhead
still
hurrying
eastward
the
white
bank
drove
on
unveiling
as
it
fled
the
yosemite
walls
plateau
and
every
object
to
the
eastward
as
far
as
mount
clark
as
yet
the
valley
bottom
was
obscured
by
a
layer
of
mist
and
cloud
which
rose
to
the
height
of
about
a
thousand
feet
submerging
and
pile
between
these
strata
the
cloud
above
and
the
cloud
below
every
object
was
in
clear
distinct
view
the
sharp
terrible
fronts
of
precipices
capped
with
a
fresh
cover
of
white
plunged
down
into
the
still
gray
river
of
cloud
below
their
stony
surfaces
clouded
with
purple
and
bandings
of
brown
all
hues
unnoticeable
in
lights
forest
and
crag
and
plateau
and
distant
mountain
were
to
a
uniform
whiteness
only
the
dark
gorge
beneath
us
showed
the
least
traces
of
color
there
all
was
rich
deep
gloomy
even
over
the
snowy
surfaces
above
there
prevailed
an
almost
ashen
gray
which
reflected
itself
from
the
dull
drifting
sky
a
few
torn
locks
of
vapor
poured
over
the
cliffedge
at
intervals
and
crawled
down
like
wreaths
of
smoke
floating
gracefully
and
losing
themselves
at
last
in
the
bank
of
cloud
which
lay
upon
the
bottom
of
the
valley
on
a
sudden
the
whole
gray
roof
rolled
away
like
a
scroll
leaving
the
heavens
from
west
to
far
east
one
expanse
of
pure
warm
blue
setting
sunlight
smote
full
upon
the
stony
walls
below
and
shot
over
the
plateau
country
gilding
here
a
snowy
forest
group
and
there
a
of
whitened
ridge
the
whole
air
sparkled
with
diamond
particles
red
light
streamed
in
through
the
open
yosemite
gateway
brightening
those
vast
solemn
faces
of
stone
and
intensifying
the
deep
neutral
blue
of
shadowed
alcoves
the
luminous
in
the
east
rolled
from
the
last
sierra
summit
leaving
the
whole
chain
of
peaks
in
broad
light
each
rocky
crest
strongly
red
the
newly
fallen
snow
marbling
it
over
with
a
soft
deep
rose
and
wherever
a
cañon
carved
itself
down
the
rocky
fronts
its
course
was
traceable
by
a
shadowy
band
of
blue
the
middle
distance
glowed
with
a
tint
of
golden
yellow
the
broken
heights
along
the
and
edges
of
the
cliff
in
front
were
of
an
intense
spotless
white
far
below
us
the
cloud
stratum
melted
away
revealing
the
floor
of
the
valley
whose
russet
and
emerald
and
brown
and
red
burned
in
the
broad
evening
sun
it
was
a
marvellous
piece
of
contrasted
lights
the
distance
so
pure
so
soft
in
its
rosy
warmth
so
cool
in
the
depth
of
its
shadowy
blue
the
foreground
strong
in
fiery
orange
or
sparkling
in
absolute
whiteness
i
enjoyed
too
looking
up
at
the
pure
unclouded
sky
which
now
wore
an
aspect
of
intense
serenity
for
half
an
hour
nature
seemed
in
entire
repose
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
white
shafts
of
the
trees
not
a
sound
of
animate
creature
or
the
most
distant
reverberation
of
waterfall
reached
us
no
film
of
vapor
moved
across
the
tranquil
sapphire
sky
absolute
quiet
reigned
until
a
loud
roar
proceeding
from
capitan
turned
our
eyes
in
that
direction
from
the
round
cap
of
its
summit
there
moved
down
an
avalanche
gathering
volume
and
swiftness
as
it
rushed
to
the
brink
and
then
leaping
out
two
or
three
hundred
feet
into
space
fell
slowly
filtering
down
through
the
lighted
air
like
a
silver
cloud
until
within
a
thousand
feet
of
the
earth
it
floated
into
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
and
sank
to
the
ground
as
a
faint
blue
mist
next
the
cathedral
snow
poured
from
its
lighted
summit
in
resounding
avalanches
then
the
three
brothers
shot
off
their
loads
and
afar
from
the
east
a
deep
roar
reached
us
as
the
whole
thundered
down
the
flank
of
cloud
s
rest
we
were
warned
by
the
hour
to
make
all
haste
and
driving
the
poor
brutes
before
us
worked
our
way
down
the
trail
as
fast
as
possible
the
light
already
pale
left
the
distant
heights
in
still
more
glorious
contrast
a
zone
of
amber
sky
rose
behind
the
glowing
peaks
and
a
cold
plain
of
snow
skirted
their
bases
mist
slowly
gathered
again
in
the
gorge
below
us
and
overspread
the
valley
floor
shutting
it
out
from
our
view
we
ran
down
the
zigzag
trail
until
we
came
to
that
shelf
of
bare
granite
immediately
below
the
final
descent
into
the
valley
here
we
paused
just
above
the
surface
of
the
clouds
which
swept
by
fitful
breezes
rose
in
swells
floating
up
and
sinking
again
like
waves
of
the
sea
intense
light
more
glowing
than
ever
streamed
in
upon
the
upper
half
of
the
cliffs
their
bases
sunken
in
the
purple
mist
as
the
crawled
upward
in
the
breeze
they
here
and
there
touched
a
light
and
fell
back
again
into
the
shadow
we
watched
these
effects
with
greatest
interest
and
just
as
we
were
about
moving
on
again
a
loud
burst
as
of
heavy
thunder
arrested
us
sounding
as
if
the
very
walls
were
crashing
in
we
looked
and
from
the
whole
brow
of
capitan
rushed
over
one
huge
avalanche
breaking
into
the
finest
powder
and
floating
down
through
orange
light
disappearing
in
the
sea
of
purple
cloud
beneath
us
we
soon
mounted
and
pressed
up
the
valley
to
our
camp
where
our
anxious
friends
greeted
us
with
enthusiastic
welcome
and
beans
we
fed
our
exhausted
animals
a
full
ration
of
barley
and
turned
them
out
to
shelter
themselves
as
best
they
might
under
friendly
oaks
or
among
young
pines
in
anticipation
of
our
return
the
party
had
gotten
up
a
capital
supper
to
which
we
first
administered
justice
then
punishment
and
finally
annihilation
brief
starvation
and
a
healthy
combat
for
life
with
the
elements
lent
a
most
marvellous
zest
to
the
appetite
under
the
subtle
influences
of
a
free
circulation
and
a
stinging
cold
night
i
perceived
a
region
of
the
taste
which
answers
to
those
most
refined
blue
waves
of
the
spectrum
clouds
which
had
enfolded
the
heavens
rolled
off
to
the
east
in
torn
fillets
of
gold
the
stars
came
out
full
and
flashing
in
the
darkling
sky
of
evening
we
left
our
cabins
and
grouped
ourselves
round
a
loquacious
which
prattled
incessantly
and
distilled
volumes
of
that
mild
stimulant
pyroligneous
acid
an
gas
which
seems
to
have
inspired
much
domestic
poetry
however
it
may
have
affected
the
new
england
olfactory
nerves
the
vast
light
in
contrast
with
the
deep
nocturnal
violet
heavens
rose
far
into
the
night
apparently
holding
up
a
roof
of
stars
whose
brilliancy
faded
quite
rapidly
until
finally
the
last
blinking
points
of
light
died
out
and
cold
hard
gray
stretched
from
cliff
to
cliff
far
up
cañons
and
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
we
could
hear
terrible
crashing
among
the
trees
and
breaking
in
deep
long
surges
against
faces
of
granite
coming
nearer
and
nearer
they
swept
down
the
gorges
with
volume
increasing
every
moment
until
they
poured
into
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
and
fell
upon
its
groves
with
terrible
fury
the
wind
shrieked
wild
and
high
among
the
summit
crags
it
tore
through
the
and
now
and
then
a
sudden
sharp
crash
resounded
through
the
valley
as
one
after
another
old
infirm
pines
were
hurled
down
before
its
blast
the
very
walls
seemed
to
tremble
the
air
was
thick
with
flying
leaves
and
dead
branches
the
snow
of
the
summits
hard
frozen
by
a
sudden
chill
was
blown
from
the
walls
and
filled
the
air
with
its
keen
cutting
crystals
at
last
the
very
clouds
torn
into
wild
flocks
were
swept
down
into
the
valley
filling
it
with
opaque
hurrying
vapors
rocks
loosening
themselves
from
the
plateau
came
thundering
down
crashing
upon
piles
and
forest
groups
below
sleet
and
snow
and
rain
fell
fast
and
the
boom
of
falling
trees
and
crashing
avalanches
followed
one
another
in
an
almost
uninterrupted
roar
in
the
sentinel
gorge
back
of
our
camp
an
avalanche
of
rock
was
suddenly
let
loose
and
came
down
with
a
harsh
rattle
the
bowlders
bounding
over
piles
and
tearing
through
the
trees
by
our
camp
a
vivid
belt
of
blue
lightning
flashed
down
through
the
blackness
and
for
a
moment
every
outline
of
cliff
and
forest
forms
and
the
rushing
clouds
of
snow
and
sleet
were
lighted
up
with
a
cold
pallid
gleam
the
burst
of
thunder
which
followed
rolled
but
for
a
moment
and
was
silenced
by
the
furious
storm
in
the
moment
of
lightning
i
saw
that
the
yosemite
fall
which
had
been
dry
for
a
month
had
suddenly
sprung
into
life
again
vast
volumes
of
water
and
ice
were
pouring
over
and
beating
like
upon
the
granite
below
our
mules
came
up
to
the
cabin
and
stood
on
its
lee
side
trembling
and
uttering
suppressed
moans
after
hours
the
fitfulness
of
the
tempest
passed
away
leaving
a
grand
monotonous
roar
it
had
torn
off
all
the
rotten
branches
of
the
year
and
prostrated
every
decrepit
tree
and
at
last
settled
down
to
a
continuous
gale
laden
with
torrents
of
rain
we
lay
down
upon
our
bunks
in
our
clothes
watching
and
listening
through
all
the
first
hours
of
the
night
sleep
was
impossible
angry
winds
and
the
fury
of
drifting
rain
shook
our
little
shelters
and
kept
us
wide
awake
toward
morning
a
second
thunderstorm
burst
and
by
the
light
of
its
flashes
i
saw
that
the
river
had
risen
nearly
to
our
cabin
door
covering
the
broad
valley
in
front
of
us
with
a
sheet
of
flood
gradually
the
sound
of
yosemite
fall
grew
louder
and
stronger
the
throbs
as
it
beat
upon
the
rocks
rising
higher
and
higher
till
the
whole
valley
rung
with
its
pulsations
by
dawn
the
storm
had
spent
its
fury
rain
ceased
and
around
us
the
air
was
perfectly
still
but
aloft
among
cliffs
and
walls
the
gale
might
still
be
heard
sweeping
across
the
forest
and
tearing
itself
among
granite
needles
fearing
that
so
continuous
a
storm
might
block
up
our
mountain
trails
hyde
and
cotter
and
wilmer
with
instruments
and
started
early
and
went
out
to
clark
s
ranch
so
dense
and
impenetrable
a
fog
overhung
us
that
daylight
came
with
extreme
slowness
and
it
was
nine
o
clock
before
we
rose
for
breakfast
and
at
ten
a
gloomy
sea
of
mist
still
hung
over
the
valley
the
merced
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
ran
wild
toward
noon
the
mist
began
to
draw
down
the
valley
and
finally
all
drifted
away
leaving
us
shut
in
by
a
gray
canopy
of
cloud
which
stretched
from
wall
to
wall
hanging
down
here
and
there
in
deep
blue
sags
in
this
stratum
of
gray
were
lost
many
higher
summits
but
the
whole
form
of
valley
and
cliff
could
be
seen
with
terrible
distinctness
the
walls
apparently
drawn
together
their
bases
at
one
or
two
points
pushed
into
yellow
floods
of
water
which
lay
like
lakes
upon
the
level
expanse
the
whole
lip
of
yosemite
was
filled
to
the
brim
and
through
it
there
poured
a
broad
full
torrent
of
white
shortly
after
noon
a
few
rifts
opened
overhead
showing
a
far
sky
from
which
poured
gushes
of
strong
yellow
sunlight
touching
here
and
there
upon
sombre
faces
of
cliff
and
occasionally
gilding
the
falling
torrent
a
wind
still
blew
smiting
the
yosemite
precipice
and
playing
strangest
games
with
the
fall
itself
at
one
time
a
gust
rushed
upon
the
lip
of
the
fall
with
such
violence
as
to
dam
back
all
its
waters
we
could
see
its
white
pile
in
the
lip
mounting
higher
and
higher
still
held
back
by
the
wind
until
there
must
have
been
a
front
of
from
a
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
feet
of
boiling
white
water
for
a
whole
minute
not
a
drop
poured
down
the
wall
but
gathering
strength
the
torrent
overcame
the
wind
rushed
out
with
tremendous
violence
leaped
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
straight
out
into
air
and
fell
clear
to
the
rocks
below
dashing
high
and
white
again
and
breaking
into
a
cloud
of
spray
that
filled
the
lower
air
of
the
valley
for
a
mile
while
the
water
was
held
back
in
the
gorge
there
was
a
moment
of
complete
silence
but
when
it
finally
burst
out
again
a
crash
as
of
sudden
thunder
shook
the
air
at
times
gusts
of
wind
would
drive
upon
the
three
brothers
cliff
and
be
deflected
toward
the
yosemite
swinging
the
whole
mighty
cataract
like
a
pendulum
and
again
pouring
upon
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
it
would
gather
up
the
whole
fall
in
whirl
it
in
a
festoon
and
carry
it
back
over
the
very
summit
of
the
walls
i
got
out
the
theodolite
to
measure
the
angle
of
its
deflection
and
while
watching
it
swung
over
an
entire
now
carried
from
the
cliffs
to
the
right
and
then
whirled
back
in
a
cloud
of
foam
over
the
head
of
the
three
brothers
a
very
frequent
prank
was
to
loop
the
whole
hundred
feet
of
cataract
into
a
single
festoon
which
fell
in
the
form
of
fine
fringe
throughout
the
afternoon
we
did
little
else
than
watch
these
forms
of
falling
water
until
toward
evening
when
we
walked
up
to
see
the
merced
i
never
beheld
such
a
rapid
rise
in
any
river
from
a
mere
brook
hiding
itself
away
under
overhanging
banks
and
among
shrubby
islands
it
sprang
in
one
night
to
the
size
of
a
full
large
river
flowing
with
the
rapidity
of
a
torrent
and
whirling
in
its
eddies
huge
trunks
of
pines
as
twilight
gathered
the
scene
deepened
into
a
most
indescribable
gloom
shadows
covered
half
the
precipices
and
sullen
unvaried
sky
stretched
over
us
its
implacable
gray
there
was
something
positively
fearful
in
this
color
such
an
impenetrable
sky
might
overarch
the
inferno
as
we
looked
it
slowly
sank
creeping
down
precipices
filling
the
whole
gorge
coming
down
down
and
fitting
the
cliffs
like
the
piston
of
an
till
within
a
thousand
feet
of
us
it
became
stationary
and
then
slowly
lifted
again
clearing
the
summit
and
rising
to
an
almost
infinite
remoteness
slowly
a
few
hard
sharp
crystals
of
snow
floated
down
later
the
air
became
intensely
chilly
and
by
dark
was
full
of
slowly
falling
snow
giving
prospect
of
a
great
mountain
storm
which
might
close
the
sierras
on
the
following
morning
we
determined
at
all
costs
to
pack
our
remaining
instruments
and
escape
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
to
the
depth
of
seven
or
eight
inches
and
through
drifting
we
could
occasionally
get
glimpses
and
see
that
every
cliff
was
deeply
buried
in
snow
we
had
still
a
few
barometrical
observations
along
the
mariposa
trail
which
were
necessary
to
complete
our
series
of
altitudes
and
i
started
in
advance
of
gardiner
and
clark
to
break
the
trail
expecting
that
when
i
stopped
to
make
readings
they
would
easily
overtake
me
two
hours
hard
work
was
needed
to
reach
the
ascent
it
was
not
until
noon
that
i
made
inspiration
point
snow
having
deepened
to
eighteen
inches
entirely
obliterating
the
trail
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
extreme
frequency
of
our
journeys
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
follow
it
as
it
was
with
occasional
mistakes
which
were
soon
remedied
i
kept
the
way
very
well
and
my
tracks
made
it
easy
for
the
party
behind
having
reached
the
plateau
i
made
my
two
barometrical
stations
and
then
started
alone
through
forests
for
westfall
s
cabin
every
was
a
solid
cone
of
white
and
often
clusters
of
five
or
six
were
buried
together
in
one
common
pile
now
and
then
a
little
sunlight
broke
through
the
clouds
and
in
these
intervals
the
scene
was
one
of
wonderful
beauty
tall
shafts
of
fir
often
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
high
trimmed
with
white
branches
cast
their
blue
shadows
upon
snowy
ground
at
about
four
o
clock
after
nine
hours
of
hard
tramping
i
reached
westfall
s
cabin
built
a
fire
and
sat
down
to
warm
myself
and
wait
for
my
friends
in
half
an
hour
they
made
their
appearance
looking
haggard
and
weary
declaring
they
would
go
no
farther
that
night
they
led
their
mule
into
the
cabin
and
unpacked
and
began
to
make
themselves
comfortably
at
home
about
five
the
darkness
of
night
had
fairly
settled
down
and
with
it
came
a
gentle
but
dense
it
seemed
to
me
a
terrible
risk
for
us
to
remain
in
the
mountains
and
i
felt
it
to
be
absolutely
necessary
that
one
at
least
should
press
on
to
clark
s
so
that
if
a
really
great
storm
should
come
he
could
bring
up
aid
accordingly
i
volunteered
to
go
on
myself
clark
and
gardiner
expressing
their
determination
to
remain
where
they
were
at
all
costs
at
this
juncture
cotter
s
voice
sounded
through
the
woods
as
he
approached
the
cabin
he
had
been
all
day
climbing
from
clark
s
and
had
come
to
lend
a
hand
in
getting
the
things
down
he
was
of
my
opinion
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
one
of
us
at
least
to
go
back
to
clark
s
and
offered
if
i
thought
best
to
try
to
accompany
me
i
had
come
from
yosemite
and
he
from
clark
s
having
travelled
all
day
and
it
was
no
slight
task
for
us
to
face
storm
and
darkness
in
the
forest
and
among
complicated
spurs
of
the
sierra
we
ate
our
lunch
by
the
cabin
fire
bade
our
friends
and
walked
out
together
into
the
darkness
for
the
first
mile
there
was
no
danger
of
missing
our
way
even
in
the
darkness
of
night
cotter
s
tracks
could
be
seen
but
after
about
half
an
hour
it
began
to
be
very
difficult
to
keep
the
trail
the
storm
increased
to
a
tempest
and
exhaustion
compelled
us
to
travel
slower
and
slower
it
was
with
intense
anxiety
that
we
searched
for
blazed
trees
along
the
trail
often
thrusting
our
arms
down
in
the
snow
to
feel
for
a
blaze
that
we
knew
of
if
it
was
not
there
we
had
for
a
moment
an
overpowering
sense
of
being
lost
but
we
were
ordinarily
rewarded
after
searching
upon
a
few
trees
and
the
blaze
once
found
animated
us
with
new
courage
hour
after
hour
we
travelled
down
the
mountain
falling
off
high
banks
now
and
then
for
in
the
dark
all
ideas
of
slope
were
lost
it
must
have
been
about
midnight
when
we
reached
what
seemed
to
be
the
verge
of
a
precipice
if
our
calculations
were
right
we
must
have
come
to
the
edge
of
the
south
fork
cañon
here
cotter
sank
with
exhaustion
and
declared
that
he
must
sleep
i
rolled
him
over
and
implored
him
to
get
up
and
struggle
on
for
a
little
while
longer
when
i
felt
sure
that
we
must
get
down
to
the
south
fork
cañon
he
utterly
refused
and
lay
there
in
a
drowsy
condition
fast
giving
up
to
the
effects
of
fatigue
and
cold
i
unbound
a
long
scarf
which
was
tied
round
his
neck
put
it
under
his
arms
like
a
harness
and
tying
it
round
my
body
started
on
dragging
him
through
the
snow
to
see
if
by
that
means
i
might
not
exasperate
him
to
rise
and
labor
on
in
a
few
minutes
it
had
its
effect
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
fell
upon
me
in
a
burst
of
indignation
a
few
words
were
enough
to
bring
him
to
himself
when
the
old
calm
courage
was
reasserted
and
we
started
together
to
make
our
way
down
the
cliff
happily
we
at
length
found
the
right
ridge
and
rapidly
descended
through
forest
to
the
river
side
believing
that
we
must
still
be
below
the
bridge
we
walked
rapidly
up
the
bank
until
at
last
we
found
it
and
came
quickly
to
clark
s
we
pounded
upon
the
cabin
door
and
waked
up
our
friends
who
received
us
with
joy
and
set
about
cooking
us
a
supper
it
was
two
o
clock
when
we
arrived
and
by
three
we
all
went
off
again
to
our
bunks
my
anxiety
about
gardiner
and
clark
prevented
my
sleeping
every
few
minutes
i
went
to
the
door
before
dawn
it
had
cleared
again
and
remained
fair
till
the
next
noon
when
the
two
made
their
appearance
no
sooner
were
they
quietly
housed
than
the
storm
burst
again
with
renewed
strength
howling
among
the
forest
trees
grandly
snow
drifted
heavily
all
the
afternoon
and
through
the
night
it
still
fell
reaching
an
average
depth
of
about
two
feet
by
the
following
morning
we
were
up
early
and
packed
upon
the
animals
our
instruments
and
personal
effects
leaving
all
the
blankets
and
heavy
luggage
to
be
gotten
out
in
the
following
spring
we
toiled
slowly
and
heavily
up
chowchilla
trail
the
branches
of
the
great
pines
and
firs
were
overloaded
with
snow
which
now
and
then
fell
in
small
avalanches
upon
our
heads
here
and
there
an
old
bough
gave
way
under
its
weight
and
fell
with
a
soft
thud
into
the
snow
we
took
turns
breaking
trail
napoleon
the
mule
distinguishing
himself
greatly
by
following
its
intricate
crooks
while
the
bravest
of
us
by
turns
held
to
his
tail
there
is
something
deeply
humiliating
in
this
process
all
the
domineering
qualities
of
mankind
vanished
before
the
quick
subtle
instinct
of
that
noble
animal
the
mule
and
his
superior
strength
came
out
in
magnificent
style
with
a
sublime
scorn
of
his
former
master
he
started
ahead
dragging
me
proudly
after
him
i
had
sometimes
thrashed
that
mule
with
unsympathetic
violence
and
i
fancied
it
was
something
very
like
poetic
justice
thus
submissively
to
follow
in
his
wake
midday
found
us
upon
the
chowchilla
summit
following
a
trail
deeply
buried
and
often
obliterated
and
undiscoverable
but
for
our
leader
as
we
descended
the
west
slope
the
snow
grew
more
and
more
moist
less
deep
and
gradually
turned
into
rain
an
hour
s
tramp
found
us
upon
bare
ground
under
the
fiercely
driving
rain
which
quickly
soaked
us
to
the
bone
the
streams
as
we
descended
were
found
to
be
more
and
more
swollen
until
at
last
it
required
some
nerve
to
ford
the
little
brooklets
which
the
mule
had
drunk
dry
on
our
upward
journey
the
earth
was
thoroughly
softened
and
here
and
there
the
trail
was
filled
with
brimming
brooks
which
rapidly
gullied
it
out
a
more
drowned
and
bedraggled
set
of
fellows
never
walked
out
upon
the
and
turned
toward
mariposa
streams
of
water
flowed
from
every
fold
of
our
garments
our
soaked
hats
clung
to
our
cheeks
the
baggage
was
a
mass
of
pulp
and
the
mules
smelled
violently
of
wet
hide
fortunately
our
carefully
strapped
in
so
far
resisted
wetting
it
was
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
we
reached
dulong
s
house
and
were
surprised
to
see
the
water
flowing
over
the
top
of
the
bridge
in
ordinary
times
a
dry
arroyo
traverses
this
farm
and
runs
under
a
bridge
in
front
of
the
house
clark
our
only
mounted
man
rode
out
as
he
supposed
upon
the
bridge
but
unfortunately
it
was
gone
and
he
and
his
horse
plunged
splendidly
into
the
stream
they
came
to
the
surface
clark
with
a
look
of
intense
astonishment
on
his
face
and
the
mare
sputtering
and
striking
out
wildly
for
the
other
side
being
a
strong
swimmer
she
reached
the
bank
climbed
out
and
clark
politely
invited
us
to
follow
the
napoleon
was
brought
to
the
brink
and
induced
to
plunge
in
by
an
application
of
his
cyclopean
organ
piloting
him
safely
across
when
he
was
quickly
followed
by
the
other
mules
we
watched
the
load
of
instruments
with
some
anxiety
and
were
not
reassured
when
their
heavy
weight
bore
the
mule
quite
under
but
she
climbed
successfully
out
and
we
ourselves
half
swimming
half
floundering
managed
to
cross
a
little
way
farther
we
came
upon
another
stream
rushing
violently
across
the
road
sweeping
down
logs
and
sections
of
fence
here
clark
dismounted
and
we
drove
the
whole
train
in
three
animals
got
safely
over
but
the
instrument
mule
was
swept
down
stream
and
badly
snagged
lying
upon
one
side
with
his
head
under
water
cotter
and
gardiner
and
clark
ran
up
stream
and
got
across
upon
a
log
i
made
a
dash
for
the
snagged
mule
and
by
strong
swimming
managed
to
catch
one
of
his
feet
and
then
his
tail
and
worked
myself
toward
the
shore
it
was
something
of
a
task
to
hold
his
head
out
of
the
water
but
i
was
quickly
joined
by
the
others
and
we
managed
to
drag
him
out
by
the
head
and
tail
there
he
lay
upon
the
bank
on
his
side
tired
of
life
utterly
refusing
to
get
upon
his
feet
the
most
abominable
specimen
of
inertia
and
indifference
while
i
was
pricking
him
vigorously
with
a
tripod
the
ground
caved
under
my
feet
and
i
quickly
sank
cotter
who
was
standing
close
by
seized
me
by
the
cape
of
my
soldier
s
overcoat
and
landed
me
as
carefully
as
he
would
a
fish
as
we
marched
down
the
road
unconsciously
keeping
step
the
sound
of
our
boots
had
quite
a
symphonic
effect
they
were
full
of
water
and
with
soft
melodious
slushing
acted
as
a
calmer
upon
our
spirits
the
road
in
some
places
was
cut
out
many
feet
deep
and
we
were
obliged
to
climb
upon
the
wooded
banks
and
make
laborious
at
last
we
reached
a
branch
of
the
chowchilla
which
was
pouring
in
a
flood
between
a
man
s
house
and
his
barn
here
we
formed
a
line
a
mule
between
each
two
men
our
line
was
swept
frightfully
down
stream
but
the
leader
gained
his
feet
and
we
came
out
safe
and
dripping
upon
on
the
other
side
a
mile
farther
we
came
upon
the
main
chowchilla
which
was
running
a
perfect
flood
from
being
a
mere
brooklet
it
had
swollen
to
a
considerable
river
with
waves
five
and
six
feet
high
sweeping
down
its
centre
we
formed
our
line
and
attempted
the
passage
but
were
thrown
back
it
would
have
been
madness
to
try
it
again
and
we
turned
sorrowfully
back
to
the
last
ranch
cotter
and
i
piloted
the
animals
over
to
the
barn
and
upon
returning
threw
a
rope
to
our
friends
upon
the
other
side
and
were
drawn
through
the
swift
water
in
the
we
found
two
bachelors
typical
california
partners
who
were
quietly
partaking
of
their
supper
of
bacon
fried
onions
japanese
tea
and
biscuits
which
like
harry
york
s
had
too
much
saleratus
we
stood
upon
their
threshold
awhile
and
dripped
quite
a
rill
descending
over
the
two
steps
trickling
down
the
as
a
new
fork
of
the
chowchilla
we
asked
for
supper
and
shelter
but
were
met
with
such
a
gruff
inhospitable
reply
that
we
lost
all
sense
of
modesty
and
walked
in
with
all
our
moisture
we
stretched
a
rope
across
the
middle
of
the
before
a
huge
fire
in
an
open
chimney
then
stripping
ourselves
to
the
buff
we
hung
up
our
steaming
clothes
upon
the
line
and
turned
solemnly
round
and
round
before
the
fire
drying
our
persons
in
the
meanwhile
our
inhospitable
landlords
made
the
best
of
the
situation
and
proceeded
to
achieve
more
onions
and
more
saleratus
biscuit
for
our
entertainment
upon
our
departure
in
the
morning
the
generous
rancher
charged
us
hotel
prices
the
flood
had
utterly
disappeared
and
we
passed
over
the
chowchilla
with
surprise
and
dry
shoes
at
mariposa
we
parted
from
clark
and
devoted
two
whole
days
to
struggling
through
the
mud
of
san
joaquin
valley
to
san
francisco
where
we
arrived
wet
and
exhausted
just
in
time
to
get
on
board
the
new
york
steamer
on
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
day
out
gardiner
and
i
seated
ourselves
under
the
grateful
shadow
of
a
bewitching
sister
thrumming
her
guitar
while
the
chocolate
for
our
breakfast
boiled
the
slumberous
haze
of
the
tropics
hung
over
lake
nicaragua
but
high
above
its
indistinct
pearly
vale
rose
the
smooth
cone
of
the
volcano
of
omatepec
robed
in
a
cover
of
pale
emerald
green
warmth
repose
the
verdure
of
eternal
spring
the
poetical
whisper
of
palms
the
heavy
odor
of
the
tropical
blooms
banished
the
grand
cold
fury
of
the
sierra
which
had
left
a
permanent
chill
in
our
bones
ix
merced
ramblings
delightful
oaks
cast
protecting
shadows
over
our
camp
on
the
of
june
just
beyond
a
little
where
hoover
was
preparing
his
mind
and
pan
for
an
omelet
stood
fremont
s
mariposa
cottage
with
doors
and
windows
wide
open
still
keeping
up
its
air
of
hospitable
invitation
though
now
deserted
and
fallen
into
decay
a
little
farther
on
through
an
opening
a
few
clustered
roofs
and
chimneys
of
the
bear
valley
village
showed
their
distant
tint
among
heavy
masses
of
green
eastward
swelled
up
a
great
ridge
upon
whose
grassy
slopes
were
rough
serpentine
outcrops
groups
of
pines
and
with
pale
green
foliage
and
clean
white
bark
under
the
roots
of
this
famous
mount
bullion
have
been
mined
those
gold
veins
whose
treasure
enriched
so
few
whose
promise
allured
so
many
as
i
altogether
distrust
my
ability
to
speak
of
this
region
without
sooner
or
later
alluding
to
a
certain
discovery
of
some
scientific
value
which
i
once
made
here
i
deem
it
wise
frankly
to
tell
the
story
and
discharge
my
mind
of
it
at
once
and
if
possible
forever
in
the
winter
of
i
came
to
bear
valley
as
the
sole
occupant
of
a
the
sierras
were
quite
and
desolation
such
as
drought
has
never
before
or
since
been
able
to
make
reigned
in
dreary
monotony
over
all
the
plains
from
stockton
to
hornitas
ordinarily
solitude
is
with
me
only
a
happy
synonym
for
content
but
throughout
that
ride
i
was
preyed
upon
by
and
in
an
aggravated
manner
the
paleontologist
of
our
survey
my
senior
in
rank
and
experience
had
just
said
of
me
rather
in
sorrow
than
in
unkindness
yet
with
unwonted
severity
i
believe
that
fellow
had
rather
sit
on
a
peak
all
day
and
stare
at
those
than
find
a
fossil
in
the
metamorphic
sierra
and
in
spite
of
me
all
that
weary
ride
his
judgment
rang
in
my
ear
can
it
be
i
asked
myself
has
a
student
of
geology
so
far
forgotten
his
devotion
to
science
am
i
really
fallen
to
the
level
of
a
mere
later
when
evening
approached
and
our
wheels
began
to
rumble
over
upturned
edges
of
sierra
slate
every
jolt
seemed
aimed
at
me
every
thin
sharp
outcrop
appeared
risen
up
to
preach
a
sermon
on
my
friend
s
text
i
myself
to
geology
and
was
framing
a
resolution
to
delve
for
that
greatly
important
but
missing
link
of
evidence
the
fossil
which
should
clear
up
an
old
unsolved
riddle
of
upheaval
age
when
over
to
eastward
a
fervid
crimson
light
smote
the
and
cleared
a
bright
pathway
through
to
the
peaks
and
on
to
a
pale
sky
through
this
gateway
of
rolling
gold
and
red
cloud
the
summits
seemed
infinitely
high
and
far
their
stone
and
snow
hung
in
the
sky
with
lucent
delicacy
of
hue
brilliant
as
gems
yet
soft
as
air
a
mosaic
of
amethyst
and
opal
transfigured
with
passionate
light
as
gloriously
above
words
as
beyond
art
obsolete
in
the
metamorphic
were
promptly
forgotten
and
during
those
lingering
moments
while
peak
after
peak
flushed
and
faded
back
into
recesses
of
the
heavens
i
forgot
what
paleontological
unworthiness
was
loading
me
down
becoming
finally
quite
jolly
of
heart
but
for
many
days
thereafter
i
did
search
and
hope
leaving
no
stone
unturned
and
usually
going
so
far
as
to
break
them
open
indeed
my
third
hammer
and
i
were
losing
temper
together
when
one
noon
i
was
tired
and
sat
down
to
rest
and
lunch
in
the
bottom
of
hell
s
hollow
a
cañon
whose
profound
uninterestingness
is
quite
beyond
portrayal
shut
in
by
great
monotonous
slopes
and
innumerable
spurs
each
the
exact
of
the
other
with
no
distance
no
faintest
suggestion
of
a
only
a
lofty
chaparral
ridge
sweeping
around
cutting
off
all
eastern
lookout
with
a
few
disordered
bowlders
tumbled
into
the
bed
of
a
feeble
brooklet
of
bitter
water
it
seemed
to
me
the
place
of
places
for
a
fossil
here
was
nadir
the
zenith
of
my
heart
banished
even
from
sight
a
swallow
of
tepid
alkaline
water
with
which
i
crowned
the
frugal
and
appropriate
lunch
burned
my
throat
and
completed
the
misery
of
the
occasion
jagged
outcrops
of
slate
cut
through
vulgar
at
my
feet
picking
up
my
hammer
to
turn
homeward
i
noticed
in
the
rock
an
object
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
small
cigar
it
was
the
fossil
the
object
for
which
science
had
searched
and
yearned
and
despaired
there
he
reclined
comfortably
upon
his
side
in
luxuriously
argillaceous
material
a
plump
pampered
belemnites
if
it
is
belemnites
whom
the
terrible
ordeal
of
metamorphism
had
spared
i
knelt
and
observed
the
radiating
structure
as
well
as
the
characteristic
central
cavity
and
assured
myself
it
was
beyond
doubt
he
the
age
of
the
was
discovered
i
was
at
pains
to
chip
my
victim
out
whole
and
when
he
chose
to
break
in
two
was
easily
consoled
reflecting
that
he
would
do
as
well
gummed
together
i
knew
this
mollusk
perfectly
by
sight
could
remember
how
he
looked
on
half
a
dozen
plates
of
fossils
but
i
failed
exactly
to
recollect
his
name
it
troubled
me
that
i
could
come
so
near
uttering
without
ever
precisely
hitting
upon
it
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
i
judged
it
full
time
for
my
joy
to
begin
down
the
perspective
of
years
i
could
see
before
me
spectacled
wise
men
of
some
scientific
society
and
one
who
pronounced
my
obituary
ending
thus
in
summing
up
the
character
and
labors
of
this
fallen
follower
of
science
let
it
never
be
forgotten
that
he
discovered
the
belemnites
and
perhaps
i
mused
they
will
put
over
me
a
slab
of
fossil
raindrops
those
eternally
embalmed
tears
of
nature
but
all
this
came
and
went
without
the
elation
there
was
no
doubt
i
was
not
so
happy
as
i
thought
i
should
be
once
in
after
years
i
met
an
aged
german
paleontologist
fresh
from
his
fatherland
where
through
threescore
years
and
ten
his
soul
had
fattened
on
solenhofen
limestone
and
effete
shells
from
many
and
strata
we
were
introduced
ach
he
said
with
a
kindle
of
enthusiasm
i
have
pleasure
you
to
meet
when
it
is
you
which
the
cephalopoda
discovered
then
turning
to
one
who
enacted
the
part
of
ganymede
he
remarked
zwei
now
with
freed
mind
i
should
say
something
of
the
about
our
camp
as
they
looked
in
june
once
before
the
reader
may
remember
i
pictured
their
autumn
garb
it
has
become
a
fixed
habit
with
me
to
climb
mount
bullion
whenever
i
get
a
chance
my
winter
sundays
were
many
times
spent
there
in
a
peace
and
repose
which
bear
valley
village
did
not
afford
for
that
hamlet
gave
itself
up
after
the
saturday
night
s
sleep
to
a
day
of
hellish
jocularity
the
town
passed
through
a
period
of
noisy
quarrelsome
drinking
and
disorderly
service
of
satan
then
an
hour
in
which
the
spaniard
loved
and
treated
the
later
the
americano
kicked
the
damned
greaser
out
of
town
manly
forms
slept
serenely
under
steps
and
the
few
gentlemen
of
the
old
school
steadied
themselves
against
the
and
in
ingenious
language
told
of
the
good
old
pandemonium
of
thus
mount
bullion
came
to
mean
for
me
a
sabbath
retreat
over
which
heaven
arched
pure
and
blue
silent
hours
marked
by
the
slow
sun
passing
sacredly
by
in
presence
of
nature
and
of
god
so
now
in
june
i
climbed
on
a
sunday
morning
to
my
old
retreat
found
the
same
stone
seat
with
leaning
back
and
wide
low
canopy
of
boughs
a
little
down
to
the
left
welling
among
tufts
of
grass
and
waving
tulips
is
the
spring
which
fremont
found
for
her
north
and
south
for
miles
extends
our
ridge
in
gently
rising
or
falling
outline
its
top
broadly
round
and
for
the
most
part
an
open
with
grass
carpet
and
mountain
flowers
in
wayward
loveliness
of
growth
west
you
overlook
a
wide
panorama
oak
and
pine
mottled
with
rusty
groundwork
and
cloudings
of
green
wander
down
in
rolling
lines
to
the
ripe
plain
beyond
are
plains
then
coast
ranges
rising
in
peaks
or
curved
down
in
passes
through
which
gray
banks
of
fog
drift
in
and
vanish
before
the
hot
air
of
the
plains
east
the
sierra
slope
is
rent
and
gashed
in
a
wilderness
of
cañons
yawning
deep
and
savage
miles
of
chaparral
tangle
in
dense
growth
over
walls
and
spurs
covering
with
kindly
the
staring
red
of
riven
and
gashed
earth
beyond
this
swells
up
the
more
refined
plateau
and
hill
country
made
of
granite
and
trimmed
with
pine
bold
domes
rising
above
the
green
cover
and
there
the
sharp
terrible
front
of
el
capitan
guarding
yosemite
and
looking
down
into
its
purple
gulf
beyond
again
are
the
peaks
and
among
them
one
looms
sharpest
it
is
that
obelisk
from
which
the
great
storm
drove
cotter
and
me
in
we
were
now
bound
to
push
there
as
soon
as
grass
should
grow
among
the
upper
cañons
the
air
around
my
sunday
mountain
in
june
is
dry
bland
and
fragrant
a
full
sunlight
ripens
it
to
a
perfect
temperature
giving
you
at
once
stimulus
and
rest
you
sleep
in
it
without
fear
of
dew
and
no
excess
of
hot
or
cold
breaks
up
the
even
flow
of
balmy
delight
you
see
the
wild
tulips
open
and
watch
course
over
slopes
of
birds
so
rare
on
plains
or
here
sing
you
their
fullest
and
enjoy
with
you
the
soft
white
light
or
come
to
see
you
in
your
chosen
shadow
and
bathe
in
your
spring
mountain
oaks
less
wonderful
than
great
straight
pines
but
altogether
domestic
in
their
generous
way
of
reaching
out
low
long
boughs
roofing
in
spots
of
shade
are
the
only
trees
on
the
pacific
slope
which
seem
to
me
at
all
allied
to
men
and
these
quiet
summits
these
islands
of
modest
lovely
verdure
floating
in
an
ocean
of
sunlight
lifted
enough
above
san
joaquin
plains
to
reach
pure
high
air
and
thrill
your
blood
and
brain
with
mountain
oxygen
are
yet
far
enough
below
the
rugged
wildness
of
pine
and
ice
and
rock
to
leave
you
in
peace
and
not
forever
challenge
you
to
combat
they
are
almost
the
only
places
in
the
sierras
impressing
me
as
rightly
fitted
for
human
company
i
can
not
find
in
wholesale
vineyards
and
ranches
dotted
along
the
sierra
foot
anything
which
savors
of
the
eternal
indigenous
perfume
of
home
they
are
scenes
of
speculation
and
thrift
of
immense
enterprise
and
comfort
with
no
end
of
fences
and
square
miles
of
grain
with
here
and
there
astounding
specimens
of
modern
upholstery
to
say
nothing
of
pianos
with
elaborate
legs
and
always
discordant
keys
but
they
never
comfort
the
soul
with
that
air
of
sacred
household
reserve
of
simple
human
poetry
which
elsewhere
greets
you
under
plainer
roofs
and
broods
over
your
days
and
nights
familiarly
here
on
these
still
summits
the
oaks
lock
their
arms
and
gather
in
groves
around
open
slopes
of
natural
park
and
you
are
at
home
a
cottage
or
a
castle
would
seem
in
keeping
nor
would
the
savage
gorges
and
sierras
overcome
the
sober
kindliness
of
these
affectionate
trees
it
is
almost
as
hard
now
as
i
write
to
turn
my
back
on
mount
bullion
and
descend
to
camp
again
as
it
was
that
afternoon
in
evening
and
supper
were
at
hand
hoover
having
achieved
a
repast
of
with
salad
from
the
italian
garden
near
at
hand
it
added
no
little
to
my
peace
that
two
obese
squaws
from
the
neighboring
rancheria
had
come
and
squatted
in
silence
on
either
side
of
our
adding
their
statuesque
sobriety
and
bronze
to
the
dusky
druidical
scene
to
be

s
next
evening
was
reward
for
our
dusty
ride
and
over
the
next
day
s
familiar
trail
we
hurried
to
clark

there
again
finding
friends
who
took
us
by
the
hand
another
day
s
end
found
us
within
the
yosemite
and
there
for
a
week
we
walked
and
rode
studied
and
looked
revisiting
all
our
old
points
lingering
hours
here
and
there
to
complete
within
our
minds
the
conception
of
this
place
my
chief
has
written
so
fully
in
his
charming
yosemite
book
of
all
main
facts
and
details
that
i
would
not
if
i
could
rehearse
them
here
what
sentiment
what
idea
does
this
leave
upon
the
earnest
observer
what
impression
does
it
leave
upon
his
heart
from
some
crag
upon
its
brink
you
look
out
over
wide
expanse
of
granite
swells
upon
whose
solid
surface
the
firs
climb
and
cluster
and
afar
on
the
sky
line
only
darken
together
in
one
deep
green
cover
upward
heave
the
eastern
ridges
above
them
looms
a
white
rank
of
peaks
into
this
plateau
is
rent
a
chasm
the
granite
falls
down
down
thousands
of
feet
in
sheer
blank
faces
or
giant
crags
broken
in
cleft
and
stair
gorge
and
bluff
down
till
they
sink
under
that
winding
ribbon
of
park
with
its
flash
of
river
among
sunlit
grass
its
darkness
where
within
shadows
of
jutting
wall
gather
the
pine
companies
or
in
summer
opening
stand
oak
and
cottonwood
casting
together
their
lengthening
shadow
over
meadow
and
pool
the
falls
like
torrents
of
snow
pour
in
white
lines
over
purple
precipice
or
as
the
wind
wills
float
and
drift
in
vanishing
film
of
airy
lacework
two
leading
ideas
are
wrought
here
with
a
force
hardly
to
be
seen
elsewhere
first
the
titanic
power
the
awful
stress
which
has
rent
this
solid
of
granite
in
twain
secondly
the
magical
faculty
displayed
by
vegetation
in
redeeming
the
aspect
of
wreck
and
masking
a
vast
geological
tragedy
behind
draperies
of
fresh
and
living
green
i
can
never
cease
marvelling
how
all
this
terrible
crush
and
sundering
is
made
fair
even
lovely
by
meadow
by
wandering
groves
and
by
those
climbing
files
of
pine
which
thread
every
gorge
and
camp
in
armies
over
every
brink
nor
can
i
ever
banish
from
memory
another
gorge
and
fall
that
of
the
shoshone
in
idaho
a
sketch
of
which
may
help
the
reader
to
see
more
vividly
those
peculiarities
of
color
and
sentiment
that
make
yosemite
so
unique
the

an
oval

the
extent
of

about
four
hundred
miles
westward
from
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
across
idaho
and
into
the
middle
of
oregon
and
whose
breadth
in
the
direction
of
the
meridian
averages
about
seventy
miles
irregular
chains
of
mountains
bound
it
in
every
direction
piling
up
in
a
few
places
to
an
elevation
of
nine
thousand
feet
the
surface
of
this
basin
is
unbroken
by
any
considerable
peak
here
and
there
knobs
belonging
to
the
earlier
geological
formations

above
its
level
and
in
a
few
instances
mounds
of
volcanic
rock

lifted
from

an
inclination
from
east
to
west
and
a
quite
perceptible
sag
along
the
middle
line
in
general
outline
the
geology
of
the
region
is
simple
its
bounding
ranges
were
chiefly
blocked
out
at
the
period
of
jurassic
upheaval
when
the
sierra
nevada
and
wahsatch
mountains
were
folded
masses
of
upheaved
granite
with
overlying
slates

main
materials

hills
during
the
cretaceous
and
tertiary
periods
the
entire
basin
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
blue
mountains
of
oregon
was
a
lake
on
whose
bottom
was
deposited
a
curious
succession
of
sand
and
clay
beds
including
near
the
surface
a
layer
of
white
infusorial
silica
at
the
exposures
of
these
rocks
in
the
of
the
present
drainage
system
are
found
ample
evidences
of
the
kind
of
life
which
flourished
in
the

and
lived
upon
its
borders
savage

how
and
wherefore
this
lake
dried
up
and
gave
place
to
the
present
barren
wilderness
of
sand
and

is
one
of
those
profound
conundrums
of
nature
yet
unguessed
by
geologists
from
being
a
wide
and
beautiful
expanse
of
water
edged
by
winding
with
slopes
containing
a
fauna
whose
remains
are
now
charming
those
fellows
the
paleontologists
the
scene
has
entirely
changed
and
a
monotonous
blank
desert
spreads
itself
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
only
here
and
there
near
the
snowy
a
bit
of
cool
green
contrasts
refreshingly
with
the
sterile
uniformity
of
the
plain
during
the
period
of
desiccation
perhaps
in
a
measure
accounting
for
it
a
general
flood
of
lava
poured
down
from
the
mountains
and
deluged
nearly
the
whole
snake
basin
the
chief
sources
of
this
lava
lay
at
the
eastern
edge
where
subsequent
erosion
has
failed
to
level
several
commanding
groups
of
volcanic
peaks
the
three
buttes
and
three
tetons
mark
centres
of
flow
remarkable
features
of
the
volcanic
period
were
the
sheets
of
basaltic
lava
which
closed
the
eruptive
era
and
in
thin
continuous
layers
overspread
the
plain
for
three
hundred
miles
the
earlier
flows
extended
farthest
to
the
west
the
ragged
broken
terminations
of
the
later
sheets
recede
successively
eastward
in
a
broad
gradual
stairway
so
that
the
present
topography
of
the
basin
is
a
gently
inclined
field
of
basaltic
lava
sinking
to
the
west
and
finally
by
a
series
of
terraced
steps
descending
to
the
level
of
lacustrine
which
mark
the
bottom
of
the
ancient
lake
and
cover
the

portion
of

find
their
way
through
a
series
of
upland
valleys
to
the
eastern
margin
of
the
snake
plain
and
there
gathering
in
one
main
stream
flow
westward
occupying
a
gradually
deepening
cañon
a
narrow
dark
gorge
through
the
thin
sheets
of
basalt
cutting
down
as
it
proceeds
to
the
westward
until
in
longitude
it
has
worn
seven
hundred
feet
into
the
lava
several
tributaries
flowing
through
similar
though
less
profound
cañons
join
the
snake
both
north
and
south
from
the
days
of
lewis
for
whom
this
snake
or
shoshone
river
was
originally
named
up
to
the
present
day
rumors
have
been
current
of
cataracts
in
the
snake
cañon
it
is
curious
to
observe
that
all
the
earlier
accounts
estimate
their
height
as
six
hundred
feet
which
is
exactly
the
figure
given
by
the
first
jesuit
observers
of
niagara
that
erratic
amateur
indian
catlin
actually
visited
these
falls
and
his
account
of
them
while
it
entirely
fails
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
their
formation
and
grandeur
is
nevertheless
in
the
main
truthful
since
the
mining
development
of
idaho
several
parties
have
visited
and
examined
the
shoshone
in
october
with
a
small
detachment
of
the
united
states
geological
survey
of
the
parallel
the
writer
crossed
goose
creek
mountains
in
northern
utah
and
descended
by
the
old
fort
boise
road
to
the
level
of
the
snake
plain
a
gray
opaque
haze
hung
close
to
the
ground
and
shut
out
all
distance
the
monotony
of
was
overpowering
we
would
have
given
anything
for
a
good
outlook
but
for
three
days
the
mist
continued
and
we
were
forced
to
amuse
ourselves
by
chasing
occasional
antelopes
the
evening
we
camped
on
rock
creek
was
signalized
by
a
fierce
wind
from
the
northeast
it
was
a
dry
storm
which
continued
with
tremendous
fury
through
the
night
dying
away
at
daybreak
leaving
the
heavens
brilliantly
clear
we
were
breakfasting
when
the
sun
rose
and
shortly
afterward
mounting
into
the
saddle
headed
toward
the
cañon
of
the
shoshone
the
air
was
cold
and
clear
the
remotest
upon
the
horizon
could
be
distinctly
seen
and
the
forlorn
details
of
their
brown
slopes
stared
at
us
as
through
a
vacuum
a
few
miles
in
front
the
smooth
surface
of
the
plain
was
broken
by
a
ragged
zigzag
line
of
black
which
marked
the
edge
of
the
farther
wall
of
the
snake
cañon
a
dull
throbbing
sound
greeted
us
its
pulsations
were
deep
and
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
ground
beneath
our
feet
leaving
the
cavalry
to
bring
up
the
wagon
my
two
friends
and
i
galloped
on
and
were
quickly
upon
the
edge
of
the
we
looked
down
into
a
broad
circular
excavation
three
quarters
of
a
mile
in
diameter
and
nearly
seven
hundred
feet
deep
east
and
north
over
the
edges
of
the
cañon
we
looked
across
miles
and
miles
of
the
snake
plain
far
on
to
the
blue
boundary
mountains
the
wall
of
the
gorge
opposite
us
like
the
cliff
at
our
feet
sank
in
perpendicular
bluffs
nearly
to
the
level
of
the
river
the
broad
excavation
being
covered
by
rough
piles
of
black
lava
and
rounded
domes
of
trachyte
rock
we
saw
an
horizon
as
level
as
the
sea
a
circling
wall
whose
sharp
edges
were
here
and
there
battlemented
in
huge
masses
a
broad
river
smooth
and
unruffled
flowing
quietly
into
the
middle
of
the
scene
and
then
plunging
into
a
labyrinth
of
rocks
tumbling
over
a
precipice
two
hundred
feet
high
and
moving
westward
in
a
still
deep
current
to
disappear
behind
a
black
promontory
it
was
a
strange
savage
scene
a
monotony
of
pale
blue
sky
olive
and
gray
stretches
of
desert
frowning
walls
of
jetty
lava
deep
of
reflecting
here
and
there
the
intense
solemnity
of
the
cliffs
and
in
the
centre
a
dazzling
sheet
of
foam
in
the
early
morning
light
the
shadows
of
the
cliffs
were
cast
over
half
the
basin
defining
themselves
in
sharp
outline
here
and
there
on
the
river
upon
the
foam
of
the
cataract
one
point
of
the
rock
cast
a
shadow
where
the
river
flowed
round
the
western
promontory
it
was
wholly
in
shadow
and
of
a
deep
a
scanty
growth
of
coniferous
trees
fringed
the
brink
of
the
lower
cliffs
overhanging
the
river
dead
barrenness
is
the
whole
sentiment
of
the
scene
the
mere
suggestion
of
trees
clinging
here
and
there
along
the
walls
serves
rather
to
heighten
than
to
relieve
the
forbidding
gloom
of
the
place
nor
does
the
flashing
whiteness
where
the
river
tears
itself
among
the
rocky
islands
or
rolls
in
spray
down
the
cliff
brighten
the
aspect
in
contrast
with
its
brilliancy
the
rocks
seem
darker
and
more
wild
the
descent
of
four
hundred
feet
from
our
standpoint
to
the
level
of
the
river
above
the
falls
has
to
be
made
by
a
narrow
winding
path
among
rough
ledges
of
lava
we
were
obliged
to
leave
our
wagon
at
the
summit
and
pack
down
the
camp
equipment
and
photographic
apparatus
upon
carefully
led
mules
by
midday
we
were
comfortably
camped
on
the
margin
of
the
left
bank
just
above
the
brink
of
the
falls
my
tent
was
pitched
upon
the
edge
of
a
cliff
directly
overhanging
the
rapids
from
my
door
i
looked
over
the
cataract
and
whenever
the
veil
of
mist
was
blown
aside
could
see
for
a
mile
down
the
river
the
lower
half
of
the
cañon
is
excavated
in
a
gray
porphyritic
trachyte
it
is
over
this
material
that
the
snake
falls
above
the
brink
the
whole
breadth
of
the
river
is
broken
by
a
dozen
small
trachyte
islands
which
the
water
has
carved
into
fantastic
forms
rounding
some
into
low
domes
sharpening
others
into
mere
pillars
and
now
and
then
wearing
out
deep
caves
at
the
very
brink
of
the
fall
a
few
twisted
evergreens
cling
with
their
roots
to
the
rock
and
lean
over
the
abyss
of
foam
with
something
of
that
air
of
fatal
fascination
which
is
apt
to
take
possession
of
men
in
plan
the
fall
recurves
up
stream
in
a
deep
horseshoe
resembling
the
outline
of
niagara
the
total
breadth
is
about
seven
hundred
feet
and
the
greatest
height
of
the
single
fall
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
among
the
islands
above
the
brink
are
several
beautiful
cascades
where
portions
of
the
river
pour
over
in
forms
the
whole
mass
of
cataract
is
one
sheet
of
spray
in
the
early
spring
when
swollen
by
the
rapidly
melted
snows
the
river
pours
over
with
something
like
the
grand
volume
of
niagara
but
at
the
time
of
my
visit
it
was
wholly
white
foam
here
and
there
along
the
brink
the
underlying
rock
shows
through
and
among
the
islands
shallow
green
pools
disclose
the
form
of
the
underlying
trachyte
numberless
rough
shelves
break
the
fall
but
the
volume
is
so
great
that
they
are
only
discovered
by
the
glancing
outward
of
the
foam
the
river
below
the
falls
is
very
deep
the
right
bank
sinks
into
the
water
in
a
clear
sharp
precipice
but
on
the
left
side
a
narrow
pebbly
beach
extends
along
the
foot
of
the
cliff
from
the
top
of
the
wall
at
a
point
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
falls
a
stream
has
gradually
worn
a
little
stairway
thick
growths
of
evergreens
have
huddled
together
in
this
ravine
by
careful
climbing
we
descended
to
the
level
of
the
river
the
trachytes
are
very
curiously
worn
in
vertical
forms
here
and
there
an
obelisk
either
wholly
or
half
detached
from
the
juts
out
like
a
buttress
farther
down
these
projecting
masses
stand
like
a
row
of
columns
upon
the
left
bank
above
them
a
solid
capping
of
black
lava
reaches
out
to
the
edge
and
overhangs
the
river
in
abrupt
black
precipices
wherever
large
fields
of
basalt
have
overflowed
an
earlier
rock
and
erosion
has
afterward
laid
it
bare
there
is
found
a
strong
tendency
to
fracture
in
vertical
lines
the
immense
expansion
of
the
upper
surface
from
heat
seems
to
cause
deep
fissures
in
the
mass
under
the
influence
of
the
cool
shadow
of
cliffs
and
pine
and
constant
percolating
of
a
rare
fertility
is
developed
in
the
ravines
opening
upon
the
cañon
shore
a
luxuriance
of
ferns
and
mosses
an
almost
tropical
wealth
of
green
leaves
and
velvety
carpeting
line
the
banks
there
are
no
rocks
at
the
base
of
the
fall
the
sheet
of
foam
plunges
almost
vertically
into
a
dark
expanse
of
the
river
immense
volumes
of
foam
roll
up
from
the
and
whirling
about
in
the
eddying
winds
rise
often
a
thousand
feet
in
the
air
when
the
wind
blows
down
the
cañon
a
gray
mist
obscures
the
river
for
half
a
mile
and
when
as
is
usually
the
case
in
the
afternoon
the
breezes
blow
eastward
the
curls
over
the
brink
of
the
fall
and
hangs
like
a
veil
over
the
upper
river
on
what
conditions
depends
the
height
to
which
the
rises
from
the
base
of
the
fall
it
is
apparently
impossible
to
determine
without
the
slightest
wind
the
cloud
of
spray
often
rises
several
hundred
feet
above
the
and
again
with
apparently
the
same
conditions
of
river
and
atmosphere
it
hardly
reaches
the
brink
incessant
roar
reinforced
by
a
thousand
echoes
fills
the
cañon
out
of
this
monotone
from
time
to
time
rise
strange
wild
sounds
and
now
and
then
may
be
heard
a
slow
measured
beat
not
unlike
the
recurring
fall
of
breakers
from
the
white
front
of
the
cataract
the
eye
constantly
wanders
up
to
the
black
frowning
parapet
of
lava
angular
bastions
rise
sharply
from
the
general
level
of
the
wall
and
here
and
there
isolated
blocks
profiling
upon
their
sky
line
strikingly
recall
barbette
batteries
to
goad
one
s
imagination
up
to
the
point
of
perpetually
seeing
resemblances
of
everything
else
in
the
forms
of
rocks
is
the
most
vulgar
vice
of
travellers
to
refuse
to
see
the
architectural
suggestions
upon
the
snake
cañon
however
is
to
administer
a
flat
snub
to
one
s
fancy
the
whole
edge
of
the
cañon
is
deeply
cleft
in
vertical
crevasses
the
actual
brink
is
usually
formed
of
irregular
blocks
and
prisms
of
lava
poised
upon
their
ends
in
an
unstable
equilibrium
ready
to
be
tumbled
over
at
the
first
leverage
of
the
frost
hardly
an
hour
passes
without
the
sudden
boom
of
one
of
those
falling
upon
the
ragged
piles
below
night
is
the
true
time
to
appreciate
the
full
force
of
the
scene
i
lay
and
watched
it
many
hours
the
broken
rim
of
the
basin
profiled
itself
upon
a
mass
of
drifting
clouds
where
torn
openings
revealed
gleams
of
pale
moonlight
and
bits
of
remote
sky
trembling
with
misty
stars
intervals
of
light
and
blank
darkness
hurriedly
followed
each
other
for
a
moment
the
black
gorge
would
be
crowded
with
forms
tall
cliffs
ramparts
of
lava
the
rugged
outlines
of
islands
huddled
together
on
the
cataract
s
brink
faintly
luminous
foam
breaking
over
black
rapids
the
swift
white
leap
of
the
river
and
a
ghostly
formless
mist
through
which
the
and
far
reach
of
the
lower
river
were
veiled
and
unveiled
again
and
again
a
moment
of
this
strange
picture
and
then
a
rush
of
black
shadow
when
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
breaks
in
the
clouds
the
and
a
vague
white
centre
in
the
general
darkness
after
sleeping
on
the
nightmarish
brink
of
the
falls
it
was
no
small
satisfaction
to
climb
out
of
this
dantean
gulf
and
find
myself
once
more
upon
a
pleasantly
prosaic
foreground
of
sage
nothing
more
effectually
banishes
a
melotragic
state
of
the
mind
than
the
obtrusive
ugliness
and
abominable
smell
of
this
plant
from
my
feet
a
hundred
miles
of
it
stretched
eastward
a
s
walk
took
me
out
of
sight
of
the
cañon
and
as
the
wind
blew
westward
only
occasional
indistinct
pulsations
of
the
fall
could
be
heard
the
sky
was
bright
and
cloudless
and
arched
in
cheerful
vacancy
over
the
meaningless
disk
of
the
desert
i
walked
for
an
hour
following
an
old
indian
trail
which
occasionally
approached
within
seeing
distance
of
the
river
and
then
apparently
quite
satisfied
diverged
again
into
the
desert
when
about
four
miles
from
the
shoshone
it
bent
abruptly
to
the
north
and
led
to
the
cañon
edge
here
again
the
narrow
gorge
widened
into
a
broad
theatre
surrounded
as
before
by
black
vertical
walls
and
crowded
over
its
whole
surface
by
rude
piles
and
ridges
of
volcanic
rock
the
river
entered
it
from
the
east
through
a
magnificent
gateway
of
basalt
and
having
reached
the
middle
flowed
on
either
side
of
a
low
rocky
island
and
plunged
in
two
falls
into
a
deep
green
basin
a
very
singular
ridge
of
the
basalt
projected
like
an
arm
almost
across
the
river
enclosing
within
its
a
bowl
three
hundred
feet
in
diameter
and
two
hundred
feet
deep
within
this
the
water
was
of
the
same
peculiar
dappled
here
and
there
by
masses
of
foam
which
swam
around
and
around
with
a
spiral
tendency
toward
the
centre
to
the
left
of
the
island
half
the
river
plunged
off
an
overhanging
lip
and
fell
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
whole
volume
reaching
the
surface
of
the
basin
many
feet
from
the
wall
the
other
half
has
worn
away
the
edge
and
descends
in
a
tumbling
cascade
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
the
river
at
this
point
has
not
yet
worn
through
the
fields
of
basaltic
lava
which
form
the
upper
four
hundred
feet
of
the
plain
between
the
two
falls
it
cuts
through
the
remaining
beds
of
basalt
and
has
eroded
its
channel
a
hundred
feet
into
underlying
porphyritic
trachyte
the
trachyte
erodes
far
more
easily
than
the
basalt
and
its
resultant
forms
are
quite
unlike
those
of
the
black
lava
the
trachyte
islands
and
walls
are
excavated
here
and
there
in
deep
caves
leaving
island
masses
in
the
forms
of
mounds
and
towers
in
general
spherical
outlines
predominate
while
the
erosion
of
the
basalt
results
always
in
sharp
perpendicular
cliffs
with
a
steeply
inclined
talus
of
ragged
the
cliffs
around
the
upper
cataract
are
inferior
to
those
of
the
shoshone
while
the
level
of
the
upper
plain
remains
nearly
the
same
the
river
constantly
deepens
the
channel
in
its
westward
course
in
returning
from
the
upper
fall
i
attempted
to
climb
along
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
in
order
to
study
carefully
the
habits
of
the
basalt
but
i
found
myself
in
a
labyrinth
of
side
crevasses
which
were
cut
into
the
plain
from
a
hundred
to
a
thousand
feet
back
from
the
main
wall
these
recesses
were
usually
in
the
form
of
an
amphitheatre
with
black
walls
two
hundred
feet
high
and
a
bottom
filled
with
immense
fragments
of
basalt
rudely
piled
together
by
dint
of
hard
climbing
i
reached
the
actual
brink
in
a
few
places
and
saw
the
same
general
features
each
time
the
cañon
successively
widening
and
narrowing
its
walls
here
and
there
approaching
each
other
and
standing
like
pillars
of
a
gateway
the
river
alternately
flowing
along
smooth
placid
reaches
of
level
and
rushing
swiftly
down
rocky
cascades
here
and
there
along
the
cliff
are
disclosed
mouths
of
black
caverns
where
the
lava
seems
to
have
been
blown
up
in
the
form
of
a
great
blister
as
if
the
original
flow
had
poured
over
some
pool
of
water
and
converted
into
steam
by
contact
with
the
hot
rock
had
been
blown
up
by
its
immense
expansion
i
continued
my
excursions
along
the
cañon
west
of
the
shoshone
about
a
mile
below
the
fall
a
very
fine
promontory
juts
sharply
out
and
projects
nearly
to
the
middle
of
the
cañon
climbing
with
difficulty
along
its
toppling
crest
i
reached
a
point
which
i
found
composed
of
immense
angular
fragments
piled
up
in
dangerous
poise
eastward
the
battlemented
rocks
around
the
falls
limited
the
view
but
westward
i
could
see
down
long
reaches
of
river
where
islands
of
trachyte
rose
above
white
cascades
a
peculiar
and
fine
effect
is
noticeable
upon
the
river
during
all
the
midday
the
shadow
of
the
southern
cliff
is
cast
down
here
and
there
completely
darkening
the
river
but
often
defining
itself
upon
the
water
the
contrast
between
the
rich
green
of
the
sunlit
portions
and
the
deep
violet
shadow
of
the
cliff
is
of
extreme
beauty
the
snake
river
deriving
its
volume
wholly
from
the
melting
of
the
mountain
snows
is
a
direct
gauge
of
the
annual
advance
of
the
sun
in
june
and
july
it
is
a
tremendous
torrent
carrying
a
full
half
of
the
columbia
from
the
middle
of
july
it
constantly
shrinks
reaching
its
minimum
in
midwinter
at
the
lowest
it
is
a
river
equal
to
the
sacramento
or
connecticut
after
ten
days
devoted
to
walking
around
the
neighborhood
and
studying
the
falls
and
rocks
we
climbed
to
our
wagon
and
rested
for
a
farewell
look
at
the
gorge
it
was
with
great
relief
that
we
breathed
the
free
air
of
the
plain
and
turned
from
the
rocky
cañon
where
darkness
and
roar
and
perpetual
cliffs
had
bounded
our
senses
and
headed
southward
across
the
noiseless
plain
far
ahead
rose
a
lofty
blue
barrier
a
marbled
upon
its
summit
by
flecks
of
perpetual
snow
a
deep
notch
in
its
profile
opened
a
gateway
toward
this
for
leagues
ahead
of
us
a
white
thread
in
the
gray
desert
marked
the
winding
of
our
road
those
sensitively
organized
creatures
the
mules
thrilled
with
relief
at
their
escape
from
the
cañons
pressed
forward
with
a
vigor
that
utterly
silenced
the
customary
poppings
of
the
whip
and
expurgated
the
language
of
the
driver
from
his
usual
breaking
of
the
third
commandment
the
three
great
falls
of
america
niagara
shoshone
and
yosemite
all
happily
bearing
indian
names
are
as
characteristically
different
as
possible
there
seems
little
left
for
a
cataract
to
express
niagara
rolls
forward
with
something
like
the
inexorable
sway
of
a
natural
law
it
is
force
power
forever
banishing
before
its
irresistible
rush
all
ideas
of
restraint
no
sheltering
pine
or
mountain
distance
of
sierras
guards
the
approach
to
the
shoshone
you
ride
upon
a
waste
the
pale
earth
stretched
in
desolation
suddenly
you
stand
upon
a
brink
as
if
the
earth
had
yawned
black
walls
flank
the
abyss
deep
in
the
bed
a
great
river
fights
its
way
through
labyrinths
of
blackened
ruins
and
plunges
in
foaming
whiteness
over
a
cliff
of
lava
you
turn
from
the
brink
as
from
a
frightful
glimpse
of
the
inferno
and
when
you
have
gone
a
mile
the
earth
seems
to
have
closed
again
every
trace
of
cañon
has
vanished
and
the
stillness
of
the
desert
reigns
as
you
stand
at
the
base
of
those
cool
walls
of
granite
that
rise
to
the
clouds
from
the
green
floor
of
yosemite
a
beautiful
park
carpeted
with
verdure
expands
from
your
feet
vast
and
stately
pines
band
with
their
shadows
the
sunny
reaches
of
the
pure
merced
an
arch
of
blue
bridges
over
from
cliff
to
cliff
from
the
far
summit
of
a
wall
of
pearly
granite
over
stains
of
purple
and
yellow
leaping
as
it
were
from
the
very
cloud
falls
a
silver
scarf
light
graceful
luminous
swayed
by
the
wind
the
cliffs
repose
is
undisturbed
by
the
silvery
fall
whose
endlessly
varying
forms
of
spray
lend
an
element
of
life
to
what
would
otherwise
be
masses
of
inanimate
stone
the
yosemite
is
a
grace
it
is
an
adornment
it
is
a
ray
of
light
on
the
solid
front
of
the
precipice
from
yosemite
our
course
was
bent
toward
the
merced
obelisk
an
afternoon
in
early
july
brought
us
to
camp
in
the
spot
where
cotter
and
i
had
bivouacked
in
the
storm
more
than
two
years
before
i
remembered
the
crash
and
wail
of
those
two
dreary
nights
the
thunderous
fulness
of
tempest
beating
upon
cliffs
and
the
stealthy
silent
and
perhaps
to
the
memory
of
that
bitter
experience
was
added
the
contrasting
force
of
s
beauty
a
warm
afternoon
sun
poured
through
cloudless
skies
into
one
rocky
amphitheatre
the
little
alpine
meadow
and
full
arrowy
brook
were
flanked
upon
either
side
by
broad
rounded
masses
of
granite
and
margined
by
groups
of
vigorous
upland
trees
firs
for
the
most
part
but
watched
over
here
and
there
by
towering
pines
and
great
aged
junipers
whose
massive
red
trunks
seemed
welded
to
the
very
stone
it
was
altogether
exhilarating
even
little
billy
the
gray
horse
found
it
so
and
devoted
more
time
to
practical
jokes
upon
mules
than
to
the
rich
and
tempting
verdure
nor
did
the
high
cool
air
banish
from
his
tender
heart
a
glowing
platonic
affection
for
our
brown
mare
sally
to
the
ripened
charms
of
middle
age
sally
united
something
more
than
the
memory
of
youth
she
was
remarkably
plump
and
her
figure
firm
and
elastic
and
she
did
not
hesitate
to
display
it
with
many
little
arts
in
presence
of
her
favored
billy
she
drew
deep
sighs
and
had
quite
an
irresistible
fashion
of
turning
sadly
aside
and
moving
away
among
trees
alone
as
if
she
had
no
one
to
love
her
a
wile
never
failing
to
bring
him
to
her
side
and
elicit
such
attention
as
smoothing
her
mane
or
even
a
pressure
of
lips
upon
her
brow
and
woe
to
the
emotional
mule
who
ventured
to
cross
our
little
meadow
just
to
feel
for
a
moment
the
soft
comfort
of
her
presence
with
the
bitterness
of
a
rejected
suit
he
always
bore
away
of
jealous
billy
he
led
her
quietly
down
to
the
brook
and
never
drank
a
drop
until
the
mare
was
done
then
they
paid
a
call
at
camp
nosing
about
among
the
kettles
with
familiar
freedom
nibbling
playfully
at
and
and
when
we
threw
sticks
at
them
trotted
off
as
closely
as
if
they
had
been
harnessed
together
in
quiet
moonlit
hours
before
i
went
to
bed
i
saw
them
still
side
by
side
her
head
leaning
over
his
withers
billy
at
staring
dramatically
with
pointed
ears
into
forest
depths
a
true
and
watchful
guardian
a
little
reconnoitring
had
shown
us
the
most
direct
way
to
the
obelisk
whose
sharp
summit
looked
from
the
moraine
to
west
of
us
as
grand
and
alluring
as
we
had
ever
thought
it
there
was
in
our
hope
of
scaling
this
point
something
more
than
mere
desire
to
master
a
difficult
peak
it
was
a
station
of
great
topographical
value
the
apex
of
many
triangles
and
more
than
all
would
command
a
grander
view
of
the
merced
region
than
any
other
summit
july
eleventh
about
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
gardiner
and
i
strapped
packs
upon
our
shoulders
my
friend
s
load
consisted
of
the
temple
transit
his
blanket
and
a
great
tin
cup
mine
was
made
up
of
compass
level
blanket
and
provisions
for
both
besides
the
barometer
which
as
usual
i
slung
over
one
shoulder
for
the
first
time
that
year
we
found
ourselves
slowly
zigzagging
to
and
fro
following
a
grade
with
that
peculiarly
deliberate
gait
to
which
mountaineering
experience
very
soon
confines
one
black
firs
and
pines
covered
in
clumps
all
the
lower
slope
but
ascending
we
came
more
and
more
into
open
ground
walking
on
glacial
among
trains
of
huge
bowlders
and
occasional
thickets
of
slender
delicate
young
trees
emerging
finally
into
open
granite
country
we
came
full
in
sight
of
our
goal
whose
great
western
precipice
rose
sheer
and
solid
above
us
from
the
south
base
of
the
obelisk
a
sharp
mural
ridge
curves
east
surrounding
an
amphitheatre
whose
sloping
rugged
sides
were
picturesquely
mottled
in
snow
and
stone
from
the
summit
of
this
ridge
we
knew
we
should
look
over
into
the
upper
merced
basin
a
great
billowy
granite
depression
lying
between
the
merced
group
and
mount
lyell
the
birthplace
of
all
those
ice
rivers
and
torrents
which
join
in
the
little
yosemite
and
form
the
river
merced
toward
this
we
pressed
hurrying
rapidly
as
the
sun
declined
in
hopes
of
making
our
point
before
darkness
should
obscure
the
beyond
it
put
us
at
our
best
to
hasten
over
the
rough
rudely
piled
blocks
and
up
cracks
among
solid
bluffs
of
granite
but
with
the
sun
fully
half
an
hour
high
we
reached
the
obelisk
foot
and
looked
from
our
eastward
into
the
new
land
from
our
feet
granite
and
ice
in
steep
curves
fell
abruptly
down
to
the
merced
cañon
brink
and
beyond
over
the
great
gulf
rose
terraces
and
ridges
of
sculptured
stone
dressed
with
one
above
another
up
to
the
eastern
rank
of
peaks
whose
sharp
solid
forms
were
still
in
full
light
from
below
it
is
always
a
most
interesting
feature
of
the
mountaineer
s
daily
life
to
watch
fading
sunlight
upon
the
and
snow
there
is
something
peculiarly
charming
in
the
deep
carmine
flush
and
in
the
pale
gradations
of
violet
and
cool
into
which
it
successively
fades
we
were
now
in
the
very
midst
of
this
alpine
glow
our
rocky
amphitheatre
opening
directly
to
the
sun
was
crowded
full
of
this
pure
red
light
warmed
to
deepest
rose
gnarled
stems
of
dead
pines
were
dark
vermilion
the
rocks
yellow
and
the
vast
body
of
the
obelisk
at
our
left
one
spire
of
gold
piercing
the
sapphire
zenith
eastward
far
below
us
the
illilluette
basin
lay
in
a
peculiarly
mild
haze
its
deep
carpet
of
forest
warmed
into
faint
bronze
and
the
bare
domes
and
rounded
granite
ridges
which
everywhere
rise
above
the
trees
were
yellow
of
a
soft
creamy
tint
farther
down
every
foothill
was
perceptibly
reddened
under
the
level
beams
sunlight
reflecting
from
every
object
shot
up
to
us
enriching
the
brightness
of
our
amphitheatre
we
drank
and
breathed
the
light
its
mellow
warmth
permeating
every
fibre
we
spread
our
blankets
under
the
lee
of
an
overhanging
rock
sheltered
from
the
keen
east
wind
and
in
full
view
of
the
broad
western
horizon
after
a
short
of
this
wonderful
light
the
sun
rested
for
an
instant
upon
the
coast
ranges
and
sank
leaving
our
mountains
suddenly
dead
as
if
the
very
breath
of
life
had
ebbed
away
cold
gray
shadows
covering
their
rigid
bodies
and
pale
sheets
of
snow
half
shrouding
their
forms
for
a
full
hour
after
the
sun
went
down
we
did
little
else
than
study
the
western
sky
watching
with
greatest
interest
a
wonderful
permanence
and
singular
gradation
of
lingering
light
over
two
hundred
miles
of
horizon
a
low
stratum
of
pure
orange
covered
the
sky
for
seven
or
eight
degrees
above
that
another
narrow
band
of
and
then
the
cool
dark
evening
blue
i
always
notice
whenever
one
gets
a
very
wide
view
of
remote
horizon
from
some
lofty
the
sky
loses
its
high
domed
appearance
the
gradations
reaching
but
a
few
degrees
upward
from
the
earth
creating
the
general
form
of
an
inverted
saucer
the
orange
and
beryl
bands
occupied
only
about
fifteen
degrees
in
altitude
but
swept
around
nearly
from
north
to
south
it
was
as
if
a
wonderfully
transparent
and
brilliant
rainbow
had
been
stretched
along
the
sky
line
at
eleven
the
colors
were
still
perceptible
and
at
midnight
when
i
rose
to
observe
the
thermometer
they
were
gone
but
a
low
faint
zone
of
light
still
lingered
at
gray
dawn
we
were
up
and
cooking
our
rasher
of
bacon
and
soon
had
shouldered
our
instruments
and
started
for
the
top
the
obelisk
is
flattened
and
expands
its
base
into
two
sharp
serrated
ridges
which
form
its
north
and
south
edges
the
broad
faces
turned
to
the
east
and
west
are
solid
and
utterly
inaccessible
the
latter
being
almost
vertical
the
former
quite
too
steep
to
climb
we
started
therefore
to
work
our
way
up
the
south
edge
and
having
crossed
a
little
ravine
from
whose
head
we
could
look
down
eastward
upon
steep
and
westward
along
the
ridge
up
which
we
had
clambered
began
in
good
earnest
to
mount
rough
blocks
of
granite
the
edge
here
is
made
of
immense
broken
rocks
poised
on
each
other
in
delicate
balance
vast
masses
threatening
to
topple
over
at
a
touch
this
blade
has
from
a
distance
a
considerably
smooth
and
even
appearance
but
we
found
it
composed
of
pinnacles
often
a
hundred
feet
high
separated
from
the
main
top
by
a
deep
vertical
cleft
more
than
once
after
struggling
to
the
top
of
one
of
these
pinnacles
we
were
obliged
to
climb
down
the
same
way
in
order
to
avoid
the
notches
finally
when
we
had
reached
the
brink
of
a
vertical
the
edge
no
longer
afforded
us
even
a
foothold
there
were
left
but
the
smooth
impossible
western
face
and
the
treacherous
cracked
front
of
the
eastern
precipice
we
were
driven
out
upon
the
latter
and
here
forced
to
climb
with
the
very
greatest
care
one
of
us
always
in
advance
making
sure
of
his
foothold
the
other
passing
up
instruments
by
hand
and
then
cautiously
following
in
this
way
we
spent
nearly
a
full
hour
going
from
crack
to
crack
clinging
by
the
least
protruding
masses
of
stone
now
and
then
looking
over
our
shoulders
at
the
wreck
of
granite
the
slopes
of
ice
and
frozen
lake
thousands
of
feet
below
and
then
upward
to
gather
courage
from
the
bold
red
spike
which
still
rose
grandly
above
us
at
last
we
struggled
up
to
what
we
had
all
along
believed
the
summit
and
found
ourselves
only
on
a
minor
turret
the
great
needle
still
a
hundred
feet
above
from
rock
to
rock
and
crevice
to
crevice
we
made
our
way
up
a
fractured
edge
until
within
fifty
feet
of
the
top
and
here
its
sharp
angle
rose
smooth
and
vertical
the
eastern
precipice
carved
in
a
flat
face
upon
the
one
side
the
western
broken
by
a
smoothly
curved
recess
like
the
corner
of
a
room
no
human
being
could
scale
the
edge
an
arctic
bluebird
fluttered
along
the
eastern
slope
in
vain
quest
of
a
foothold
and
alighted
panting
at
our
feet
one
step
more
and
we
stood
together
on
a
little
detached
pinnacle
where
by
steadying
ourselves
against
the
sharp
vertical
obelisk
edge
we
could
rest
although
the
keen
sense
of
steepness
below
was
not
altogether
pleasing
about
seven
feet
across
the
open
head
of
a
a
mere
recess
in
the
west
face
was
a
vertical
crack
riven
into
the
granite
not
more
than
three
feet
wide
but
as
much
as
eight
feet
deep
in
it
were
wedged
a
few
loose
bowlders
below
it
opened
out
into
space
at
the
head
of
this
crack
a
rough
crevice
led
up
to
the
summit
summoning
nerve
i
knew
i
could
make
the
leap
but
the
life
and
death
question
was
whether
the
would
give
way
under
my
weight
and
leave
me
struggling
in
the
smooth
recess
sure
to
fall
and
be
dashed
to
atoms
two
years
we
had
longed
to
climb
that
peak
and
now
within
a
few
yards
of
the
summit
no
weakheartedness
could
stop
us
i
thought
should
the
give
way
by
a
very
quick
turn
and
powerful
spring
i
could
regain
our
rock
in
safety
there
was
no
discussion
but
planting
my
foot
on
the
brink
i
sprang
my
side
brushing
the
rough
projecting
crag
while
in
the
air
i
looked
down
and
a
picture
stamped
itself
on
my
brain
never
to
be
forgotten
the
crumbled
and
moved
i
clutched
both
sides
of
the
cleft
relieving
all
possible
weight
from
my
feet
the
rocks
wedged
themselves
again
and
i
was
safe
it
was
a
delicate
feat
of
balancing
for
us
to
bridge
that
chasm
with
a
transit
and
pass
it
across
the
view
it
afforded
down
the
abyss
was
calculated
to
make
a
man
cool
and
steady
barometer
and
knapsack
were
next
passed
over
i
placed
them
all
at
the
crevice
head
and
flattened
myself
against
the
rock
to
make
room
for
gardiner
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
in
his
eye
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
abyss
in
his
leap
it
gave
me
such
a
chill
as
no
amount
of
danger
or
even
death
coming
to
myself
could
ever
give
the
grated
under
his
weight
an
instant
and
wedged
themselves
again
we
sprang
up
on
the
rocks
like
chamois
and
stood
on
the
top
shouting
for
joy
our
summit
was
four
feet
across
not
large
enough
for
the
transit
instrument
and
both
of
us
so
i
whose
duties
were
geological
descended
to
a
niche
a
few
feet
lower
and
sat
down
to
my
writing
the
sense
of
aërial
isolation
was
thrilling
away
below
rocks
ridges
crags
and
fields
of
ice
swell
up
in
jostling
confusion
to
make
a
base
from
which
springs
the
spire
of
stone
feet
high
on
all
sides
i
could
look
right
down
at
the
narrow
pedestal
eastward
great
ranks
of
peaks
culminating
in
mount
lyell
were
in
full
clear
view
all
streams
and
cañons
tributary
to
the
merced
were
beneath
us
in
distinctness
afar
to
the
west
lay
the
rolling
plateau
gashed
with
cañons
there
the
white
line
of
yosemite
fall
and
beyond
half
submerged
in
warm
haze
my
sunday
mountain
the
same
little
arctic
bluebird
came
again
and
perched
close
by
me
pouring
out
his
sweet
simple
song
with
a
gayety
and
freedom
which
wholly
charmed
me
during
our
four
hours
stay
the
thought
that
we
must
make
that
leap
again
gradually
intruded
itself
and
whether
writing
or
studying
the
country
i
could
not
altogether
free
myself
from
its
pressure
it
was
a
relief
when
we
packed
up
and
descended
to
the
horrible
cleft
to
actually
meet
our
danger
we
had
now
an
unreliable
footing
to
spring
from
and
a
mere
block
of
rock
to
balance
us
after
the
jump
we
sprang
strongly
struck
firmly
and
were
safe
we
worked
patiently
down
the
east
face
wound
among
blocks
and
pinnacles
of
the
lower
descent
and
hurried
through
moraines
to
camp
well
pleased
that
the
obelisk
had
not
vanquished
us
x
copples
s
one
october
day
as
kaweah
and
i
travelled
by
ourselves
over
a
lonely
foothill
trail
i
came
to
consider
myself
the
friend
of
woodpeckers
with
rather
more
reserve
as
regards
the
bluejay
let
me
admit
great
interest
in
his
worldly
wisdom
as
an
instance
of
living
the
partnership
of
these
two
birds
is
rather
more
hopeful
than
most
mundane
experiments
for
many
autumn
and
winter
months
such
food
as
their
dainty
taste
chooses
is
so
rare
throughout
the
sierras
that
in
default
of
any
climatic
temptation
to
migrate
the
birds
get
in
harvests
with
annual
regularity
and
surprising
labor
oak
and
pine
mingle
in
open
growth
acorns
from
the
one
are
their
grain
the
soft
pine
bark
is
granary
and
this
the
process
armies
of
woodpeckers
drill
small
round
holes
in
the
bark
of
standing
sometimes
perforating
it
thickly
up
to
twenty
or
thirty
and
even
forty
feet
above
the
ground
then
about
equal
numbers
of
woodpeckers
and
jays
gather
acorns
rejecting
always
the
little
cup
and
insert
the
gland
tightly
in
the
pine
bark
with
its
tender
base
outward
and
exposed
to
the
air
a
woodpecker
having
drilled
a
hole
has
its
exact
measure
in
mind
and
after
examining
a
number
of
acorns
makes
his
selection
and
never
fails
of
a
perfect
fit
not
so
the
jolly
careless
jay
who
picks
up
any
sound
acorn
he
finds
and
if
it
is
too
large
for
a
hole
drops
it
in
the
most
way
as
if
it
were
an
affair
of
no
consequence
utters
one
of
his
dry
chuckling
squawks
and
either
tries
another
or
loafs
about
lazily
watching
the
woodpeckers
thus
they
live
amicably
harvesting
and
with
this
sequel
those
acorns
in
which
grubs
form
become
the
sole
property
of
woodpeckers
while
all
sound
ones
fall
to
the
jays
ordinarily
chances
are
in
favor
of
woodpeckers
and
when
there
are
absolutely
no
sound
nuts
the
jays
sell
short
so
to
speak
and
go
over
to
nevada
and
speculate
in
the
monotony
of
hill
and
glade
failing
to
interest
me
and
in
default
of
other
diversion
i
all
day
long
watched
the
birds
recalling
how
many
gay
and
successful
jays
i
knew
who
lived
as
these
on
the
wit
and
industry
of
less
ostentatious
woodpeckers
thinking
too
what
naïvely
dogmatic
and
richly
worded
political
economy
ruskin
would
phrase
from
my
feathered
friends
thus
i
came
to
ruskin
wishing
i
might
see
the
work
of
his
idol
and
after
that
longing
for
some
equal
artist
who
should
arise
and
choose
to
paint
our
sierras
as
they
are
with
all
their
power
of
innumerable
pine
and
countless
pinnacle
gloom
of
tempest
or
splendor
where
rushing
light
shatters
itself
upon
granite
crag
or
burns
in
dying
rose
upon
far
fields
of
snow
had
i
rubbed
aladdin
s
lamp
a
turn
in
the
trail
brought
suddenly
into
view
a
man
who
sat
under
shadow
of
oaks
painting
upon
a
large
canvas
as
i
approached
the
artist
turned
half
round
upon
his
stool
rested
palette
and
brushes
upon
one
knee
and
in
familiar
tone
said
dern
d
if
you
ain
t
just
naturally
ketched
me
at
it
get
off
and
set
down
you
ain
t
going
for
no
doctor
i
my
artist
was
of
short
dressed
in
what
had
formerly
been
black
broadcloth
with
an
enlivening
show
of
red
flannel
shirt
about
the
throat
wrists
and
a
considerable
display
of
the
same
where
his
waistcoat
might
once
have
overlapped
a
strained
but
as
yet
coherent
waistband
the
cut
of
these
garments
by
length
of
and
voluminous
leg
proudly
asserted
a
bay
origin
his
small
feet
were
squeezed
into
tight
short
boots
with
high
raking
heels
a
round
face
with
small
full
mouth
nose
and
black
protruding
eyes
showed
no
more
sign
of
the
ideal
temperament
than
did
the
broad
daub
upon
his
square
yard
of
canvas
going
to
copples
s
inquired
my
friend
that
was
my
destination
and
i
answered
that
s
me
he
ejaculated
right
over
there
down
below
those
two
oaks
ever
there
my
s
there
now
giving
impressive
accent
to
the
word
all
the
while
these
few
words
were
passing
he
scrutinized
me
with
unconcealed
curiosity
puzzled
as
well
he
might
be
by
my
dress
and
equipment
finally
after
i
had
tied
kaweah
to
a
tree
and
seated
myself
by
the
easel
and
after
he
had
absently
rubbed
some
raw
sienna
into
his
little
store
of
white
he
softly
ventured
was
you
looking
out
a
ditch
no
i
replied
he
neatly
rubbed
up
the
white
and
sienna
with
his
blender
unconsciously
adding
a
dash
of
veronese
green
gazed
at
my
leggings
then
at
the
barometer
and
again
meeting
my
eye
with
a
look
as
if
he
feared
i
might
be
a
disguised
duke
said
in
slow
tone
with
hyphens
of
silence
between
each
two
syllables
giving
to
his
language
all
the
dignity
of
an
unabridged
webster
i
would
take
pleasure
in
stating
that
my
name
is
hank
smith
artist
and
seeing
me
smile
he
relaxed
a
little
and
giving
the
blender
another
vigorous
twist
added
i
would
request
smith
having
learned
my
name
occupation
and
that
my
home
was
on
the
hudson
near
new
york
quickly
assumed
a
familiar
tone
and
rattled
on
merrily
about
his
winter
in
new
york
spent
in
going
through
the
academy
a
period
of
deep
moment
to
one
who
before
that
painted
only
wagons
for
his
livelihood
storing
away
canvas
stool
and
easel
in
a
deserted
cabin
close
by
he
rejoined
me
and
leading
kaweah
by
his
lariat
i
walked
beside
smith
down
the
trail
toward
copples
s
he
talked
freely
and
as
if
composing
his
own
biography
beginning
and
his
nature
soon
drove
him
into
a
painter
s
then
he
reverted
fondly
to
new
york
and
his
experience
there
oh
no
he
mused
in
pleasant
irony
he
never
spread
his
napkin
over
his
legs
and
partook
french
victuals
up
to
old
delmonico
s
twasn
t
which
took
to
the
in
a
sort
of
to
me
he
added
was
a
stood
for
them
sculptors
you
know
perfectly
virtuous
and
built
from
the
ground
then
as
if
words
failed
him
made
an
expressive
gesture
with
both
hands
over
his
to
indicate
the
topography
of
her
figure
and
sliding
them
down
sharply
against
his
waistband
he
added
anatomical
torso
smith
found
relief
in
meeting
one
so
near
himself
as
he
conceived
me
to
be
in
habit
and
experience
the
emotions
and
ambitions
of
his
life
found
ready
utterance
and
a
willing
listener
i
learned
that
his
aim
was
to
become
a
characteristically
california
painter
with
special
designs
for
making
himself
famous
as
the
delineator
of
muletrains
and
to
be
as
he
expressed
it
the
pacific
slope
there
he
said
is
old
eastman
johnson
he
s
made
the
riffle
on
barns
and
that
everlasting
girl
with
the
ears
of
corn
but
it
ain
t
it
ain
t
got
the
real
if
you
want
to
see
thing
just
look
at
a
gérôme
his
arab
folks
and
egyptian
they
ain
t
assuming
a
pleasant
expression
and
looking
at
spots
while
their
likenesses
is
took
h
will
discount
eastman
he
avowed
his
great
admiration
of
church
which
with
a
little
leaning
toward
gifford
seemed
his
only
hearty
approval
it
s
all
bierstadt
and
bierstadt
and
bierstadt
nowadays
what
has
he
done
but
twist
and
skew
and
distort
and
discolor
and
belittle
and
this
whole
country
why
his
mountains
are
too
high
and
too
slim
they
d
blow
over
in
one
of
our
fall
winds
i
ve
herded
colts
two
summers
in
yosemite
and
honest
now
when
i
stood
right
up
in
front
of
his
picture
i
didn
t
know
it
he
hasn
t
what
old
ruskin
calls
by
this
time
the
station
buildings
were
in
sight
and
far
down
the
cañon
winding
in
even
grade
round
spur
after
spur
outlined
by
a
low
clinging
cloud
of
red
dust
we
could
see
the
great
sierra
that
industrial
flowing
from
california
plains
over
into
arid
nevada
carrying
thither
materials
for
life
and
luxury
in
a
vast
perpetual
caravan
of
heavy
wagons
drawn
by
teams
of
from
eight
to
fourteen
mules
all
the
supplies
of
many
cities
and
villages
were
hauled
across
the
sierra
at
an
immense
cost
and
with
such
skill
of
driving
and
generalship
of
mules
as
the
world
has
never
seen
before
our
trail
descended
toward
the
grade
quickly
bringing
us
to
a
high
bank
immediately
overlooking
the
trains
a
few
rods
below
the
group
of
station
buildings
i
had
by
this
time
learned
that
copples
the
former
had
suffered
amputation
of
the
leg
three
times
receiving
from
the
road
men
in
consequence
the
name
of
and
that
while
his
doctors
disagreed
as
to
whether
they
had
better
try
a
fourth
the
kindly
hand
of
death
had
spared
him
that
pain
and
copples
an
added
extortion
in
the
bill
the
dying
had
made
his
wife
promise
she
would
stay
by
and
carry
on
the
station
until
all
his
debts
which
were
many
and
heavy
should
be
paid
and
then
do
as
she
chose
the
poor
woman
a
new
englander
of
some
refinement
lingered
sadly
fulfilling
her
task
though
longing
for
liberty
when
smith
came
to
speak
of
sarah
jane
her
niece
a
new
light
kindled
in
my
friend
s
eye
you
never
saw
sarah
jane
he
inquired
i
shook
my
head
he
went
on
to
tell
me
that
he
was
living
in
hope
of
making
her
but
that
the
also
indulged
a
hope
and
as
this
important
functionary
was
a
man
of
ready
cash
and
of
derringers
and
few
words
it
became
a
delicate
matter
to
avow
open
rivalry
but
it
was
evident
my
friend
s
star
was
ascendant
and
learning
that
he
considered
himself
to
possess
the
and
to
have
gaited
the
i
was
more
than
amused
even
comforted
it
was
pleasure
to
sit
there
leaning
against
a
vigorous
old
oak
while
smith
opened
his
heart
to
me
in
easy
confidence
and
with
quick
eye
watching
the
passing
mules
pencilled
in
a
little
a
leg
a
head
or
such
portions
of
body
and
harness
as
seemed
to
him
useful
for
future
works
these
are
notes
he
said
and
i
ve
pretty
much
made
up
my
mind
to
paint
my
great
picture
on
a
i
ll
scumble
in
a
sunset
effect
lighting
up
the
dust
and
striking
across
the
backs
of
team
and
driver
and
i
ll
paint
a
look
on
the
old
teamster
s
face
and
the
mules
will
be
just
their
little
selves
and
laying
down
to
work
like
they
d
expire
and
the
wagon
don
t
you
see
what
fine
there
is
in
the
heavy
load
and
with
sunlight
and
shadow
in
the
folds
and
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
smith
orders
sir
orders
that
s
what
i
ll
get
then
and
i
ll
take
my
little
old
sarah
jane
and
light
out
for
new
york
and
you
ll
see
on
a
studio
doorplate
and
folks
ll
say
fine
feeling
for
nature
has
smith
i
let
this
singular
man
speak
for
himself
in
his
own
vernacular
pruning
nothing
of
its
idiom
or
slang
as
you
shall
choose
to
call
it
in
this
faithful
transcript
there
are
words
i
could
have
wished
to
expunge
but
they
are
his
not
mine
and
illustrate
his
mental
construction
the
breath
of
most
californians
is
as
unconsciously
charged
with
slang
as
an
italian
s
of
garlic
and
the
two
after
all
have
much
the
same
function
you
touch
the
bowl
or
your
language
but
should
never
let
either
be
fairly
recognized
in
salad
or
conversation
but
smith
s
english
was
the
well
undefiled
when
compared
with
what
i
every
moment
heard
from
the
current
of
teamsters
which
set
constantly
by
us
in
the
direction
of
copples
s
close
in
front
came
a
huge
wagon
piled
high
with
cases
of
freight
and
drawn
along
by
a
team
of
twelve
mules
whose
heavy
breathing
and
drenched
skins
showed
them
and
well
tired
out
the
driver
looked
anxiously
ahead
at
a
soft
spot
in
the
road
and
on
at
the
station
as
if
calculating
whether
his
team
had
courage
left
to
haul
through
he
called
kindly
to
them
cracked
his
whip
and
all
together
they
strained
bravely
on
the
great
van
rocked
settled
a
little
on
the
near
side
and
stuck
fast
with
a
look
of
despair
the
driver
got
off
and
laid
the
lash
freely
among
his
team
they
jumped
and
jerked
frantically
tangled
themselves
up
and
at
last
all
sulked
and
became
stubbornly
immovable
meanwhile
a
mile
of
teams
behind
unable
to
pass
on
the
narrow
grade
came
to
an
unwilling
halt
about
five
wagons
back
i
noticed
a
tall
pike
dressed
in
checked
shirt
and
pantaloons
tucked
into
a
soft
felt
hat
worn
on
the
back
of
his
head
displayed
long
locks
of
flaxen
hair
which
hung
freely
about
a
florid
pink
countenance
noticeable
for
its
pair
of
violent
little
blue
eyes
and
facial
angle
rendered
acute
by
a
sharp
long
nose
this
fellow
watched
the
stoppage
with
impatience
and
at
last
when
it
was
more
than
he
could
bear
walked
up
by
the
other
teams
with
a
look
of
wrath
absolutely
devilish
one
would
have
expected
him
to
blow
up
with
rage
yet
withal
his
gait
and
manner
were
cool
and
soft
in
the
extreme
in
a
bland
almost
tender
voice
he
said
to
the
unfortunate
driver
my
friend
perhaps
i
can
help
you
and
his
gentle
way
of
disentangling
and
patting
the
leaders
as
he
headed
them
round
in
the
right
direction
would
have
given
him
a
high
office
under
bergh
he
leisurely
examined
the
embedded
wheel
and
cast
an
eye
along
the
road
ahead
he
then
began
in
rather
excited
manner
to
swear
pouring
it
out
louder
and
more
profane
till
he
utterly
eclipsed
the
most
horrid
blasphemies
i
ever
heard
piling
them
up
thicker
and
more
fiendish
till
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
earth
must
open
and
engulf
him
i
noticed
one
mule
after
another
give
a
little
squat
bringing
their
breasts
hard
against
the
collars
and
straining
traces
till
only
one
old
mule
with
ears
back
and
dangling
chain
still
held
out
the
pike
walked
up
and
yelled
one
gigantic
oath
her
ears
sprang
forward
she
squatted
in
terror
and
the
iron
links
grated
under
her
strain
he
then
stepped
back
and
took
the
rein
every
trembling
mule
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
its
eye
and
listening
at
with
a
peculiar
air
of
deliberation
and
of
childlike
simplicity
he
said
in
tones
come
up
there
mules
one
quick
strain
a
slight
rumble
and
the
wagon
rolled
on
to
copples
s
smith
and
i
followed
and
as
we
neared
the
house
he
punched
me
familiarly
and
said
as
a
brown
petticoat
disappeared
in
the
station
door
there
s
sarah
jane
when
i
see
that
girl
i
feel
like
i
d
reach
out
and
gather
her
in
then
clasping
her
imaginary
form
as
if
she
was
about
to
dance
with
him
he
executed
a
couple
of
waltz
turns
softly
intimating
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
kaweah
being
stabled
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
office
which
was
of
course
as
well
as
i
entered
the
unfortunate
teamster
was
about
paying
his
liquid
compliment
to
the
florid
pike
their
glasses
were
filled
my
respects
said
the
little
driver
the
whiskey
became
lost
to
view
and
went
eroding
its
way
through
the
dust
these
poor
fellows
had
swallowed
he
added
well
billy
you
swear
repeated
the
pike
in
a
tone
of
incredulous
questioning
me
swear
as
if
the
compliment
were
greater
than
his
modest
desert
no
i
can
t
blaspheme
worth
a
cuss
you
d
jest
orter
hear
pete
green
can
exhort
the
impenitent
i
ve
known
a
to
renounce
the
flesh
and
haul
thousand
through
a
foot
of
clay
mud
under
one
of
his
as
a
hotel
copples
s
is
on
the
mongolian
plan
which
means
that
and
kitchen
are
given
over
to
the
mercies
never
very
tender
of
chinamen
not
such
chinamen
as
learned
the
art
of
that
they
might
be
served
up
by
elia
but
the
average
john
and
a
sadly
low
average
that
john
is
i
grant
him
a
certain
general
air
of
thrift
admitting
too
that
his
lack
of
sobriety
never
makes
itself
apparent
in
loud
celtic
brawl
but
he
is
when
all
is
said
and
in
spite
of
timid
and
fawning
obedience
a
very
poor
servant
now
and
then
at
one
friend
s
house
it
has
happened
to
me
that
i
dined
upon
artistic
chinese
cookery
and
all
they
who
come
home
from
living
in
china
smack
their
lips
over
the
relishing
i
wish
they
had
sat
down
that
day
at
copples
s
no
on
second
thought
i
would
spare
them
john
may
go
peacefully
to
north
adams
and
make
shoes
for
us
but
i
shall
not
solve
the
awful
domestic
problem
by
bringing
him
into
my
kitchen
certainly
so
long
as
howells
s
mrs
johnson
lives
nor
even
while
i
can
get
an
irish
lady
to
torment
me
and
offer
the
hospitality
of
my
home
to
her
cousins
after
the
warning
bell
fifty
or
sixty
teamsters
inserted
their
dusty
heads
in
buckets
of
water
turned
their
once
white
inside
out
producing
a
sudden
effect
of
clean
linen
and
made
use
of
the
two
mournful
wrecks
of
combs
which
hung
on
strings
at
either
side
the
copples
s
mirror
many
went
to
the
bar
and
partook
of
a
there
was
then
such
clearing
of
throats
and
such
loud
and
prolonged
blowing
of
noses
as
may
not
often
be
heard
upon
this
globe
in
the
calm
which
ensued
conversation
sprang
up
on
lead
harness
the
stockton
wagon
that
had
went
off
the
grade
with
here
and
there
a
sentiment
called
out
by
two
framed
lithographic
belles
who
in
great
richness
of
color
and
scantiness
of
raiment
flanked
the
a
dazzling
reflector
chiefly
destined
to
portray
the
s
back
hair
which
work
of
art
involved
much
affectionate
labor
a
second
bell
and
rolling
away
of
doors
revealed
a
long
with
three
parallel
tables
cleanly
set
and
watched
over
by
chinamen
whose
fresh
white
clothes
and
bright
skin
made
a
contrast
of
color
which
was
always
chief
among
my
yearnings
for
the
nile
while
i
loitered
in
the
background
every
seat
was
taken
and
i
found
myself
with
a
few
dilatory
teamsters
destined
to
await
a
second
table
the
communicated
with
a
kitchen
beyond
by
means
of
two
square
apertures
cut
in
the
partition
wall
through
these
portholes
a
glare
of
red
light
poured
except
when
the
square
framed
a
chinese
cook
s
head
or
discharged
hundreds
of
little
dishes
the
teamsters
sat
down
in
patience
a
few
of
the
more
elegant
sort
cleaned
their
nails
with
the
forks
others
picked
their
teeth
with
them
and
nearly
all
speared
with
this
implement
small
specimens
from
the
dishes
before
them
securing
a
pickle
or
a
square
inch
of
pie
or
even
that
luxury
a
dried
apple
a
few
on
chairs
drummed
upon
the
bottom
of
their
plates
the
latest
tune
of
the
road
when
fairly
under
way
the
scene
became
active
and
animated
beyond
belief
waiters
balancing
upon
their
arms
twenty
or
thirty
plates
hurried
along
and
shot
them
dexterously
over
the
teamsters
heads
with
crash
and
spatter
beans
swimming
in
fat
meats
slimed
with
pale
ropy
gravy
and
over
everything
a
faint
mongol
odor
the
flavor
of
moral
degeneracy
and
of
a
disintegrating
race
sharks
and
wolves
may
no
longer
be
figured
as
types
of
prandial
haste
my
friends
the
teamsters
stuffed
and
swallowed
with
a
rapidity
which
was
alarming
but
for
the
dexterity
they
showed
and
which
could
only
have
come
of
long
practice
in
fifteen
minutes
the
room
was
empty
and
those
fellows
who
were
not
feeding
grain
to
their
mules
lighted
cigars
and
lingered
round
the
bar
just
then
my
artist
rushed
in
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
said
in
my
ear
we
ll
have
supper
over
to
copples
s
o
no
i
guess
not
sarah
jane
arms
peeled
cooking
up
stuff
old
woman
gone
into
the
with
a
he
then
added
that
if
i
wanted
to
see
what
i
had
been
spared
i
might
follow
him
we
went
round
an
angle
of
the
building
and
came
upon
a
high
bank
where
through
windows
i
could
look
into
the
chinese
kitchen
by
this
time
the
second
table
of
teamsters
were
under
way
and
the
waiters
yelled
their
orders
through
to
the
three
cooks
this
large
unpainted
kitchen
was
lighted
up
by
kerosene
lamps
through
clouds
of
smoke
and
steam
dodged
and
sprang
the
cooks
dripping
with
perspiration
and
grease
grabbing
a
steak
in
the
hand
and
slapping
it
down
on
the
gridiron
slipping
and
sliding
around
on
the
damp
floor
dropping
a
card
of
biscuits
and
picking
them
up
again
in
their
fists
which
were
garnished
by
the
whole
bill
of
fare
the
red
papers
with
chinese
inscriptions
and
little
here
and
there
pasted
upon
each
wall
the
spry
devils
themselves
and
that
faint
sickening
odor
of
china
which
pervaded
the
room
combined
to
produce
a
sense
of
deep
sober
gratitude
that
i
had
not
risked
their
fare
now
demanded
smith
you
see
that
there
little
white
building
yonder
i
did
he
struck
a
contemplative
position
leaned
against
the
house
extending
one
hand
after
the
manner
of
the
minstrel
sentimentalist
and
softly
chanted
tis
o
tis
the
cottage
of
me
love
and
there
s
where
they
re
getting
up
as
nice
a
little
supper
as
can
be
found
on
this
road
or
any
other
let
s
go
over
so
we
strolled
across
an
open
space
where
were
two
giant
pines
towering
sombre
against
the
twilight
a
little
mountain
brooklet
and
a
few
quiet
cows
stop
said
smith
leaning
his
back
against
a
pine
and
encircling
my
neck
affectionately
with
an
arm
i
told
you
as
regards
sarah
jane
how
my
feelings
stand
well
now
you
just
bet
she
s
on
the
reciprocate
when
i
told
old
woman
copples
i
d
like
to
invite
you
over
sarah
jane
she
passed
me
in
the
doorway
and
said
she
glad
to
see
then
for
we
were
very
near
he
sang
again
tis
o
tis
the
cottage
of
me
love
and
he
continued
familiarly
you
re
a
judge
of
wimmen
chucking
his
knuckles
into
my
ribs
whereat
i
jumped
when
he
added
there
i
knew
you
was
well
sarah
jane
is
a
derned
magnificent
female
number
three
boot
just
the
height
for
me
copples
i
call
her
and
would
make
the
most
touching
artist
s
wife
in
this
planet
if
i
design
to
paint
a
head
or
a
foot
or
an
arm
get
my
little
old
sarah
jane
to
peel
the
particular
charm
and
just
whack
her
in
on
the
we
passed
in
through
low
doors
turned
from
a
small
dark
entry
into
the
family
and
were
alone
there
in
presence
of
a
cheery
log
fire
which
bade
us
welcome
crackling
freely
and
tossing
its
sparks
out
upon
floor
of
pine
and
rug
a
few
old
framed
prints
hung
upon
dark
walls
their
faces
looking
serenely
down
upon
the
scanty
furniture
and
windows
full
of
flowering
plants
a
chair
not
long
since
vacated
was
drawn
close
by
the
whereon
were
a
lamp
and
a
large
open
bible
with
a
pair
of
spectacles
lying
upon
its
lighted
page
smith
made
a
gesture
of
silence
toward
the
door
touched
the
bible
and
whispered
where
old
woman
copples
lives
and
it
is
a
good
thing
i
read
it
aloud
to
her
evenings
and
i
can
just
feel
the
high
local
lights
of
it
it
ll
fetch
yet
at
this
juncture
the
door
opened
a
pale
thin
elderly
woman
entered
and
with
tired
smile
greeted
me
while
her
hard
hand
was
in
mine
i
looked
into
her
face
and
felt
something
it
may
be
it
must
be
but
little
yet
something
of
the
sorrow
of
her
life
that
of
a
woman
large
in
sympathy
deep
in
faith
eternal
in
constancy
thrown
away
on
a
rough
worthless
fellow
all
things
she
hoped
for
had
failed
her
the
tenderness
which
never
came
the
hopes
years
ago
in
ashes
the
whole
world
of
her
yearnings
long
buried
leaving
only
the
duty
of
living
and
the
hope
of
heaven
as
she
sat
down
took
up
her
spectacles
and
knitting
and
closed
the
bible
she
began
pleasantly
to
talk
to
us
of
the
warm
bright
autumn
nights
of
smith
s
work
and
then
of
my
own
profession
and
of
her
niece
sarah
jane
her
genuinely
sweet
spirit
and
natively
gentle
manner
were
very
beautiful
and
far
overbalanced
all
traces
of
rustic
birth
and
mountain
life
o
that
unquenchable
christian
fire
how
pure
the
gold
of
its
result
it
needs
no
practised
elegance
no
social
greatness
for
its
success
only
the
warm
human
heart
and
out
of
it
shall
come
a
sacred
calm
and
gentleness
such
as
no
power
no
wealth
no
culture
may
ever
hope
to
win
no
words
of
mine
would
outline
the
beauty
of
that
plain
weary
old
woman
the
sad
sweet
patience
of
those
gray
eyes
nor
the
spirit
of
overflowing
goodness
which
cheered
and
enlivened
the
half
hour
we
spent
there
might
perhaps
be
pardoned
for
showing
an
alacrity
when
the
door
again
opened
and
sarah
jane
rolled
i
might
almost
say
trundled
in
and
was
introduced
to
me
sarah
jane
was
an
essentially
californian
product
as
much
so
as
one
of
those
vast
potatoes
or
massive
pears
she
had
a
suggestion
of
in
the
fulness
of
her
physique
yet
withal
was
pretty
and
modest
if
i
could
have
rid
myself
of
a
fear
that
her
buttons
might
sooner
or
later
burst
off
and
go
singing
by
my
ear
i
think
i
might
have
felt
as
did
that
she
was
a
magnificent
female
with
her
smooth
brilliant
skin
and
ropes
of
soft
brown
hair
in
presence
of
the
ladies
lost
something
of
his
original
flavor
and
rose
into
studied
elegance
greatly
to
the
comfort
of
sarah
whose
glow
of
pride
as
his
talk
ran
on
came
without
show
of
restraint
the
supper
was
delicious
but
sarah
was
quiet
quiet
to
and
to
me
until
after
tea
when
the
old
lady
said
you
young
folks
will
have
to
excuse
me
this
evening
and
withdrew
to
her
chamber
more
logs
were
then
piled
on
the
hearth
and
we
three
gathered
in
a
presently
took
the
poker
and
twisted
it
about
among
coals
and
ashes
prying
up
the
oak
sticks
as
he
announced
in
a
measured
studied
way
an
artist
s
wife
that
is
he
explained
an
academician
s
wife
orter
well
she
d
orter
the
beautiful
and
take
her
regular
æsthetics
and
then
again
he
continued
in
explanatory
tone
she
d
orter
to
know
how
to
keep
a
hotel
derned
if
she
hadn
t
for
it
s
rough
like
furst
off
fore
a
feller
gets
his
name
up
but
then
when
he
does
tho
she
s
got
a
salubrious
old
time
of
it
it
s
touch
a
little
bell
he
pressed
the
to
show
us
how
the
thing
was
done
and
brooks
the
morning
paper
open
your
regular
herald
art
another
of
smith
s
tender
works
entitled
off
the
grade
so
full
of
and
subtle
feeling
of
nature
is
now
on
exhibition
at
goupil
look
down
a
little
further
italian
between
the
acts
all
eyes
turned
to
the
smith
who
looked
then
turning
to
me
and
waving
his
hand
at
sarah
jane
i
leave
it
to
you
if
she
don
sarah
jane
assumed
the
pleasing
color
of
the
without
seeming
inwardly
unhappy
it
s
only
a
question
of
time
with
continued
my
friend
art
is
long
you
know
derned
long
and
it
may
be
a
year
before
i
paint
my
great
picture
but
after
that
smith
works
in
lead
he
used
the
poker
freely
and
more
and
more
his
flow
of
hopes
turned
a
shade
of
sentiment
to
sarah
jane
who
smiled
broader
and
broader
showing
teeth
of
healthy
whiteness
at
last
i
withdrew
and
sought
my
room
which
was
s
also
and
his
studio
i
had
gone
with
a
candle
round
the
walls
whereon
were
tacked
studies
and
sketches
finding
here
and
there
a
bit
of
real
merit
among
the
profusion
of
trash
when
the
door
burst
open
and
my
friend
entered
kicked
off
his
boots
and
trousers
and
walked
up
and
down
at
a
sort
of
quadrille
step
singing
yes
it
s
the
cottage
of
me
love
you
bet
it
s
the
cottage
of
me
love
and
what
s
more
has
just
had
his
genteel
kiss
and
when
and
where
is
the
good
old
i
checked
his
exuberance
as
best
i
might
knowing
full
well
that
the
quiet
and
elegant
dispenser
of
neat
and
mixed
beverages
hearing
this
inquiry
would
put
in
an
appearance
in
person
and
offer
a
few
remarks
designed
to
provoke
so
i
at
last
got
smith
in
bed
and
the
lamp
out
all
was
quiet
for
a
few
moments
and
when
i
had
almost
gotten
asleep
i
heard
my
in
low
tones
say
to
himself
married
by
the
rev
gospel
our
talented
california
artist
smith
to
miss
sarah
jane
copples
no
a
pause
and
then
with
more
gentle
utterance
and
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
slowly
from
this
atmosphere
of
art
i
passed
away
into
the
tranquil
land
of
dreams
xi
shasta
we
escaped
the
harvesting
season
of
i
try
to
believe
all
its
poetry
is
not
forever
immolated
under
the
strong
wheels
of
that
pastoral
juggernaut
of
our
day
the
and
to
be
grateful
that
ruths
have
not
now
to
glean
the
fallen
and
loaf
around
at
questionable
hours
setting
their
caps
for
susceptible
ranchers
whatever
stirring
rhythm
may
measure
time
with
the
quick
of
shall
await
a
more
poetic
pen
than
this
some
modern
virgil
coming
along
the
boundless
wheat
plain
may
perhaps
sing
you
bucolic
phrases
of
the
new
iron
age
but
he
will
soon
see
his
mistake
as
will
you
the
harvest
home
with
its
longfellow
mellowness
of
atmosphere
or
even
those
ideally
colored
barns
of
eastman
johnson
s
with
corn
and
girls
and
some
of
the
lingering
personal
relationship
between
crops
and
human
hands
all
that
is
tradition
here
not
even
memory
it
is
quite
as
well
these
people
are
more
germane
with
enterprise
and
hurry
and
with
the
drink
at
some
vulgar
tavern
when
the
hired
hands
are
paid
off
and
gather
to
have
a
real
nice
time
with
the
this
was
over
the
herds
of
men
had
poured
back
to
their
cities
and
wandered
away
among
distant
mines
as
far
as
their
earnings
would
carry
them
a
few
stranded
bummers
who
awoke
from
their
nice
time
penniless
still
lingered
in
pathetic
humiliation
round
the
scene
of
their
labor
rather
heightening
that
air
of
sleep
which
now
pervaded
every
ranch
in
the
sacramento
valley
we
quitted
the
hotel
at
chico
with
relief
gratefully
turning
our
backs
upon
the
chinamen
whose
cookery
had
spoiled
our
two
days
peace
freeman
clark
will
have
to
make
out
a
better
case
for
confucius
or
else
these
fellows
were
apostate
but
they
were
soon
behind
us
a
straight
dusty
avenue
leading
us
past
clusters
of
ranches
into
a
quiet
expanse
of
level
land
and
beneath
the
occasional
shadow
of
roadside
oaks
miles
of
harvested
plain
lay
close
shaven
in
monotonous
naples
yellow
stretching
on
soft
and
vague
losing
itself
in
a
gray
haze
now
and
then
through
more
transparent
intervals
we
could
see
the
brown
sierra
feet
walling
us
in
to
eastward
their
tops
fainter
and
fainter
as
they
rose
into
this
sky
directly
overhead
hung
an
arch
of
pale
blue
but
a
few
degrees
down
the
hue
melted
into
golden
gray
looming
through
the
mist
before
us
rose
sombre
forms
of
trees
growing
in
processions
along
the
margins
of
streams
which
flow
from
the
sierra
across
the
sacramento
plain
through
these
silent
sleepy
groves
the
seclusion
is
perfect
you
come
in
from
blinding
plains
to
the
great
aged
oaks
whose
immense
breadth
of
bough
seems
outstretched
with
effort
to
shade
more
and
more
ground
alders
and
cottonwoods
line
the
stream
banks
native
grapes
in
tropical
profusion
drape
the
shores
and
hang
in
trailing
curtains
from
tree
to
tree
here
and
there
glimpses
open
into
dark
thickets
the
stream
comes
into
view
between
walls
of
green
evening
sunlight
broken
with
shadow
falls
over
rippling
shallows
still
expanses
of
deep
pool
reflect
blue
from
the
zenith
and
flow
on
into
coves
beneath
overhanging
verdure
vineyards
and
orchards
gather
themselves
pleasantly
around
men
and
women
are
dull
unrelieved
they
are
all
alike
the
eternal
flatness
of
landscape
the
monotony
of
endlessly
pleasant
weather
the
scarcely
varying
year
the
utter
want
of
anything
unforeseen
and
absence
of
all
surprise
in
life
are
legible
upon
their
quiet
uninteresting
faces
they
loaf
through
eleven
months
to
harvest
one
individuality
is
wanting
the
same
kind
of
tiresome
you
hear
at
one
table
spreads
itself
over
listening
acres
to
the
next
the
great
american
poet
it
may
confidently
be
predicted
will
not
book
his
name
from
the
sacramento
valley
the
people
the
acres
the
industry
seem
to
be
created
solely
to
furnish
vulgar
fractions
in
the
census
it
was
not
wholly
fancy
that
detected
in
the
grapes
something
of
the
same
flatness
and
sugary
insipidity
which
characterized
the
girls
i
chatted
with
on
certain
piazzas
what
an
antipode
is
the
condition
of
sterile
poverty
in
the
of
the
east
frugality
energy
mental
activity
contrast
sharply
with
the
contented
lethargy
of
this
commonplace
opulence
mile
after
mile
in
recurring
succession
of
wheatland
and
vineyard
and
dusty
shabbiness
of
graceless
stretches
on
flanking
our
way
on
either
side
until
at
last
the
undulations
of
the
are
reached
and
the
first
signs
of
vigorous
life
are
observed
in
the
trees
attitude
and
consciousness
are
displayed
in
the
lordly
oaks
which
cluster
upon
brown
hillsides
the
sacramento
which
through
the
slumberous
plain
had
flowed
in
a
still
deep
current
reflecting
only
the
hot
haze
and
motionless
forms
of
the
trees
upon
its
banks
here
courses
along
with
the
ripple
of
life
displaying
through
its
clear
waters
bowlders
and
pebbles
freighted
from
the
higher
mountains
our
road
ascending
through
sunny
valleys
and
among
rolling
hills
at
length
reaches
the
level
of
the
pines
and
climbing
to
a
considerable
crest
descends
among
a
fine
coniferous
forest
into
the
deeply
wooded
valley
of
the
pitt
lifted
high
against
the
sky
ragged
hills
of
granite
and
limestone
limit
the
view
the
river
through
a
sharp
rocky
cañon
has
descended
from
the
volcanic
plains
of
northeastern
california
cutting
its
way
across
the
sea
of
hills
which
represents
the
sierra
nevada
and
falling
toward
the
west
in
a
series
of
white
rapids
our
camp
in
the
cool
mountain
air
banished
the
fatigues
of
weary
miles
night
under
the
mountain
stars
gave
us
refreshing
sleep
and
from
the
morning
we
crossed
pitt
ferry
we
dated
a
new
life
in
a
deep
gorge
between
lofty
walls
we
came
upon
the
mccloud
a
brilliantly
pure
stream
wearing
its
way
through
lava
rocks
and
still
bearing
the
of
shasta
dark
feathery
firs
stand
in
files
along
the
swift
river
oaks
with
lustrous
leaves
rise
above
of
red
and
brown
numbers
of
indian
camps
are
posted
here
i
find
them
picturesque
low
conical
huts
opening
upon
small
smoking
fires
attended
by
squaws
numberless
salmon
split
and
drying
in
rows
upon
light
scaffoldings
make
their
conspicuous
amid
the
generally
dingy
surroundings
these
indian
faces
are
fairly
especially
when
young
i
visited
one
camp
upon
the
left
river
bank
finding
madam
at
home
seated
by
her
fireside
engaged
in
maternal
duties
i
am
almost
afraid
to
describe
the
squalor
and
grotesque
hideousness
of
her
person
she
was
emaciated
and
scantily
clad
in
a
sort
of
short
petticoat
shaggy
unkempt
hair
overhanging
a
pair
of
wild
wolf
s
eyes
the
ribs
and
stood
out
as
upon
an
anatomical
specimen
hard
black
flesh
clinging
in
formless
masses
upon
her
body
and
arms
altogether
she
had
the
appearance
of
an
animated
mummy
her
child
a
mere
amorphous
roll
clung
to
her
and
emphasized
with
cubbish
fatness
the
wan
shrunken
form
of
its
mother
looking
like
some
ravenous
leech
which
was
draining
the
woman
s
very
blood
shuddering
i
hurried
away
to
observe
the
husband
the
buck
was
spearing
salmon
a
short
distance
down
stream
his
naked
form
poised
upon
a
beam
which
projected
over
the
river
his
eyes
riveted
and
spear
uplifted
waiting
for
the
prey
sunlight
streaming
down
in
broken
masses
through
trees
fell
brilliantly
upon
his
muscular
shoulder
and
tense
compact
thigh
glancing
now
and
then
across
rigid
arms
and
the
polished
point
of
his
spear
the
swift
dark
water
rushed
beneath
him
flashing
upon
its
surface
a
shimmering
reflection
of
his
red
figure
cast
in
bronze
he
would
have
made
a
companion
for
quincy
ward
s
indian
hunter
and
better
than
a
companion
for
in
his
wolfish
sinew
and
panther
muscle
there
was
not
so
far
as
i
could
observe
that
free
greek
suppleness
which
is
so
fine
a
feature
in
ward
s
statue
though
ajax
disguised
as
an
american
indian
might
be
a
better
name
for
that
great
and
powerful
piece
of
sculpture
a
day
s
march
brought
us
from
mccloud
to
the
sacramento
here
a
small
stream
with
banks
fringed
by
a
pleasing
variety
of
trees
and
margins
graceful
with
northward
for
two
days
we
followed
closely
the
line
of
the
sacramento
river
now
descending
along
slopes
to
its
bed
where
the
stream
played
among
picturesque
rocks
and
bowlders
and
again
climbing
by
toilsome
ascents
into
the
forest
a
thousand
feet
up
on
the
cañon
wall
catching
glimpses
of
towering
ridges
of
sierra
above
and
curves
of
the
foaming
river
deep
in
the
blue
shadow
beneath
us
more
and
more
the
woods
became
darkened
with
mountain
pine
the
air
freshened
by
northern
life
gave
us
the
inspiration
of
altitude
at
last
through
a
notch
to
the
northward
rose
the
conical
summit
of
shasta
its
pale
rosy
lavas
enamelled
with
ice
body
and
base
of
the
great
peak
were
hidden
by
intervening
hills
over
whose
smooth
rolls
of
forest
green
the
bright
blue
sky
and
the
brilliant
shasta
summit
were
sharp
and
strong
from
that
moment
the
peak
became
the
centre
of
our
life
from
every
crest
we
strained
our
eyes
forward
as
now
and
then
either
through
forest
vistas
the
incandescent
snow
greeted
us
or
from
some
high
summit
the
opening
cañon
walls
displayed
grander
and
grander
views
of
the
great
volcano
it
was
sometimes
after
all
a
pleasure
to
descend
from
these
cool
heights
with
the
of
the
mountain
upon
our
minds
to
the
cañon
bottom
where
among
the
endlessly
varying
bits
of
beautiful
detail
the
mental
strain
wore
off
when
our
tents
were
pitched
at
sisson
s
while
a
picturesque
haze
floated
up
from
the
southward
we
enjoyed
the
grand
uncertain
form
of
shasta
with
its
crests
of
white
and
wide
placid
sweep
of
base
full
of
lines
as
deeply
reposeful
as
a
greek
temple
its
dark
head
lifted
among
the
fading
stars
of
dawn
and
strongly
set
upon
the
arch
of
coming
rose
appealed
to
our
emotions
but
best
we
liked
to
sit
at
evening
near
munger
s
easel
watching
the
great
lava
cone
glow
with
light
almost
as
wild
and
lurid
as
if
its
crater
still
streamed
watkins
thought
it
photographic
luck
that
the
mountain
should
so
have
draped
itself
with
mist
as
to
defy
his
camera
palmer
stayed
at
camp
to
make
observations
in
the
coloring
of
meerschaums
at
fixed
altitudes
and
to
watch
now
and
then
the
station
barometer
shasta
from
sisson
s
is
a
broad
triple
mountain
the
central
summit
being
flanked
on
the
west
by
a
large
and
quite
perfect
crater
whose
rim
reaches
about
twelve
thousand
feet
altitude
on
the
west
a
broad
spur
juts
from
the
general
slope
the
cone
rises
from
its
base
eleven
thousand
feet
in
one
sweep
a
forest
of
tall
rich
pines
surrounds
strawberry
valley
and
the
little
group
of
ranches
near
sisson
s
under
this
high
sky
and
a
pure
quality
of
light
the
whole
varied
foreground
of
green
and
gold
stretches
out
toward
the
rocky
mountain
base
in
charming
contrast
brooks

of

and

heading
for
the

over
rough
rocks
and
among
the
stunted
firs
and

which
mark
the

the

was
cool
and
clear
with
a
fresh
north
wind
sweeping
round
the

and
bringing
in

invigorating

of

region
when
we
had
gone
as
far
as
our
mules
could
carry
us
threading
their
difficult
way
among
piles
of
lava
we
dismounted
and
made
up
our
packs
of
beds
instruments
food
and
fuel
for
a
three
days
trip
turned
the
animals
over

them
and
with
sisson
who
was
to
accompany
us
up
the
first
ascent
struck
out
on
foot
already
above
vegetation
we
looked
out
over
all
the
valley
south
and
west
observing
its
arabesque
of
forest
meadow
and
chaparral
the
files
of
pines
which
struggled
up
almost
to
our
feet
and
just
below
us
the
volcano
slope
strewn
with
red
and
brown
wreck
and
patches
of
shrunken
snowdrift
our
climb
up
the
steep
western
crater
slope
was
slow
and
tiresome
quite
without
risk
or
excitement
the
footing
altogether
of
lodged
at
times
gave
way
provokingly
and
threw
us
out
of
balance
once
upon
the
spiry
pinnacles
which
crown
the
rim
a
scene
of
wild
power
broke
upon
us
the
round
bowl
about
a
mile
in
diameter
and
nearly
a
thousand
feet
deep
lay
beneath
us
its
steep
shelving
sides
of
shattered
lava
mantled
in
places
to
the
very
bottom
by
fields
of
snow
we
clambered
along
the
edge
toward
shasta
and
came
to
a
place
where
for
a
thousand
feet
it
was
a
mere
blade
of
ice
sharpened
by
the
snow
into
a
thin
frail
edge
upon
which
we
walked
in
cautious
balance
a
misstep
likely
to
hurl
us
down
into
the
chaos
of
lava
blocks
within
the
crater
passing
this
we
reached
the
north
edge
of
the
rim
and
from
a
rugged
mound
of
shattered
rock
looked
down
into
a
gorge
between
us
and
the
main
shasta
there
winding
its
huge
body
along
lay
a
glacier
riven
with
sharp
deep
crevasses
yawning
fifty
or
sixty
feet
wide
the
blue
hollows
of
their
shadowed
depth
contrasting
with
the
brilliant
surfaces
of
ice
we
studied
its
whole
length
from
the
far
high
shasta
crest
down
in
winding
course
deepening
its
cañon
more
and
more
as
it
extends
crowding
past
our
crater
cone
and
at
last
terminating
in
bold
and
a
wide
belt
of
hilly
moraine
the
surface
over
half
of
its
length
was
quite
clean
but
directly
opposite
us
occurs
a
fine
ice
cascade
its
entire
surface
is
cut
with
transverse
crevasses
which
have
a
general
tendency
to
curve
downward
and
all
this
dislocation
is
accompanied
by
a
freight
of
lava
blocks
which
shoot
down
the
cañon
walls
on
either
side
bounding
out
all
over
the
glacier
in
a
later
trip
while
watkins
was
making
his
photographic
views
i
climbed
about
going
to
the
edges
of
some
crevasses
and
looking
over
into
their
blue
vaults
where
icicles
overhang
and
a
whispered
sound
of
waterflow
comes
up
faintly
from
beneath
from
a
point
about
midway
across
where
i
had
climbed
and
rested
upon
the
brink
of
an
the
glacier
below
me
breaking
off
into
its
wild
pile
of
cascade
blocks
and
i
looked
down
over
all
the
lower
flow
broken
with
billowy
upheavals
and
bright
with
bristling
spires
of
sunlit
ice
upon
the
right
rose
the
great
cone
of
shasta
formed
of
lavas
its
sky
line
a
single
curved
sweep
of
snow
cut
sharply
against
a
deep
blue
sky
to
the
left
the
precipices
of
the
lesser
cone
rose
to
the
altitude
of
twelve
thousand
feet
their
surfaces
half
jagged
ledges
of
lava
and
half
irregular
sheets
of
ice
from
my
feet
the
glacier
sank
rapidly
between
volcanic
walls
and
the
shadow
of
the
lesser
cone
fell
in
a
dark
band
across
the
brilliantly
lighted
surface
looking
down
its
course
my
eye
ranged
over
sunny
and
shadowed
zones
of
ice
and
over
the
gray
bowlder
region
of
the
terminal
moraine
still
lower
along
the
former
track
of
ancient
and
grander
glaciers
and
down
upon
undulating
foothills
descending
in
green
steps
reaching
out
like
promontories
into
the
sea
of
plain
which
lay
outspread
nine
thousand
feet
below
basking
in
the
sunshine
its
checkered
green
fields
and
orchards
ripening
their
wheat
and
figs
our
little
party
separated
each
going
about
his
labor
the
clarks
with
theodolite
and
barometer
were
engaged
on
a
pinnacle
over
on
the
western
sisson
who
had
helped
us
thus
far
with
a
huge
of
wood
now
said
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
on
his
homeward
tramp
emmons
and
i
geologized
about
the
rim
and
interior
slope
getting
at
last
out
of
sight
of
one
another
in
sprang
up
a
sharp
cone
several
hundred
feet
high
composed
of
much
shattered
lava
and
indicating
doubtless
the
very
latest
volcanic
activity
at
its
base
lay
a
small
lakelet
frozen
over
with
rough
black
ice
far
below
us
cold
gray
banks
and
floating
flocks
of
vapor
began
to
drift
and
circle
about
the
lava
slopes
rising
higher
at
sunset
till
they
quite
enveloped
us
and
at
times
shut
out
the
view
later
we
met
for
bivouac
spread
our
beds
upon
small
under
lee
of
a
mass
of
rock
on
the
rim
and
built
a
little
around
which
we
sat
closely
clouds
still
eddied
about
us
opening
now
wide
rifts
of
sky
and
then
glimpses
of
the
shasta
summit
glowing
with
evening
light
and
again
views
down
upon
the
far
earth
where
sunlight
had
long
faded
leaving
forest
and
field
and
village
sunken
in
purple
gloom
through
the
old
broken
crater
lip
over
foreground
of
pallid
ice
and
sharp
black
lava
rocks
the
clouds
whirled
away
and
yawning
wide
revealed
an
objectless
expanse
out
of
which
emerged
dim
mountain
tops
for
a
moment
seen
then
veiled
thus
in
the
midst
of
clouds
i
found
it
extremely
interesting
to
watch
them
and
their
habits
drifting
slowly
across
the
i
saw
them
float
over
and
among
the
points
of
cindery
lava
whose
savage
forms
contrasted
wonderfully
with
the
infinite
softness
of
their
texture
i
found
it
strange
and
suggestive
that
fields
of
perpetual
snow
should
mantle
the
slopes
of
an
old
lava
caldron
that
the
very
volcano
s
throat
should
be
choked
with
a
pure
little
lakelet
and
sealed
with
unmelting
ice
that
power
of
extremes
which
held
sway
over
lifeless
nature
before
there
were
human
hearts
to
experience
its
crush
expressed
itself
with
poetic
eloquence
had
lowell
been
in
our
bivouac
i
know
he
must
have
felt
again
the
power
of
his
own
perfect
figure
of
craters
healed
with
it
was
a
wild
moment
wind
smiting
in
shocks
against
the
rock
beside
us
flaring
up
our
little
fire
and
whirling
on
with
its
into
the
darkening
crater
gulf
we
turned
in
the
clarks
together
emmons
and
i
in
our
fur
bags
upon
cold
stone
our
bed
was
anything
but
comfortable
angular
fragments
of
trachyte
finding
their
way
with
great
directness
among
our
ribs
and
under
keeping
us
almost
awake
in
that
despairing
where
dreams
and
thoughts
tangle
in
tiresome
confusion
just
after
midnight
from
sheer
weariness
i
arose
finding
the
sky
cloudless
its
whole
black
dome
crowded
with
stars
a
silver
dawn
over
the
slope
of
shasta
brightened
till
the
moon
sailed
clear
under
its
light
all
the
rugged
topography
came
out
with
unnatural
distinctness
every
impression
of
height
and
depth
greatly
exaggerated
the
empty
crater
lifted
its
rampart
into
the
light
i
could
not
tell
which
seemed
most
desolate
that
dim
moonlit
rim
with
pallid
and
gaunt
crags
or
the
solid
black
shadow
which
was
cast
downward
from
southern
walls
darkening
half
the
bowl
from
the
silent
air
every
breath
of
wind
or
whisper
of
sound
seemed
frozen
naked
lava
slopes
and
walls
the
high
gray
body
of
shasta
with
ridge
and
gorge
glacier
and
all
cold
and
still
under
the
icy
brightness
of
the
moon
produced
a
scene
of
arctic
terribleness
such
as
i
had
never
imagined
i
looked
down
eagerly
straining
my
eyes
through
the
solemn
crater
s
lip
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lower
world
but
far
below
hiding
the
earth
stretched
out
a
level
plain
of
cloud
upon
which
the
light
fell
cold
and
gray
as
upon
a
frozen
ocean
i
scrambled
back
to
bed
and
happily
to
sleep
a
real
sound
dreamless
repose
we
breakfasted
some
time
after
sunrise
and
were
soon
under
way
with
packs
on
our
shoulders
the
day
was
brilliant
and
cloudless
the
cold
still
air
full
of
life
and
inspiration
through
its
clear
blue
the
shasta
peak
seemed
illusively
near
and
we
hurried
down
to
the
saddle
which
connects
our
cone
with
the
peak
and
across
the
head
of
a
small
tributary
glacier
and
up
over
the
first
slopes
it
was
a
slow
tedious
three
hours
climb
over
stones
which
lay
as
steeply
as
loose
material
possibly
can
up
to
the
base
of
a
red
trachyte
spur
then
on
up
a
gorge
and
out
upon
a
level
mountain
shoulder
where
are
considerable
flats
covered
with
deep
ice
to
the
north
it
overflows
in
a
tributary
of
the
glacier
we
had
studied
below
here
we
rested
and
hung
the
barometer
from
clark
s
tripod
the
further
ascent
lies
up
a
long
scoria
ridge
of
loose
red
pumiceous
rock
for
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
then
across
another
level
step
curved
with
rugged
ice
and
up
into
a
sort
of
corridor
between
two
steep
and
stained
ridges
here
in
the
hollow
are
boiling
sulphurous
springs
and
hot
earth
we
sat
down
by
them
eating
our
lunch
in
the
lee
of
some
stones
a
short
rapid
climb
brought
us
to
the
top
four
hours
and
thirty
minutes
working
time
from
our
crater
bivouac
there
is
no
reason
why
anyone
of
sound
wind
and
limb
should
not
after
a
little
mountaineering
practice
be
able
to
make
the
shasta
climb
there
is
nowhere
the
shadow
of
danger
and
never
a
real
piece
of
mountain
climbing
climbing
i
mean
with
hands
and
feet
no
scaling
of
walls
or
labor
involving
other
qualities
than
simple
muscular
endurance
the
fact
that
two
young
girls
have
made
the
ascent
proves
it
a
comparatively
easy
one
indeed
i
have
never
reached
a
corresponding
altitude
with
so
little
labor
and
difficulty
whoever
visits
california
and
wishes
to
depart
from
the
beaten
track
of
yosemite
scenes
could
not
do
better
than
come
to
strawberry
valley
and
get
sisson
to
pilot
him
up
shasta
when
i
ask
myself
what
were
the
sensations
on
shasta
they
render
themselves
into
three
geography
shadows
and
uplifted
isolation
after
we
had
walked
along
a
short
curved
ridge
which
forms
the
summit
representing
as
i
believe
all
that
remains
of
the
original
crater
it
became
my
occupation
to
study
the
view
a
singularly
transparent
air
revealed
every
plain
and
peak
on
till
the
earth
s
curve
rolled
them
under
remote
horizons
the
whole
great
disk
of
world
outspread
beneath
wore
an
aspect
of
glorious
cheerfulness
the
cascade
range
a
roll
of
blue
forest
land
stretched
northward
surmounted
at
intervals
by
volcanoes
the
lower
like
symmetrical
mount
pitt
bare
and
warm
with
rosy
lava
colors
those
farther
north
lifting
against
the
pale
solid
white
cones
upon
which
strong
light
rested
with
brilliance
it
seemed
incredible
that
we
could
see
so
far
toward
the
columbia
river
almost
across
the
state
of
oregon
but
there
stood
pitt
jefferson
and
the
three
sisters
in
unmistakable
plainness
northeast
and
east
spread
those
great
plains
out
of
which
rise
low
lava
chains
and
a
few
small
volcanoes
and
there
too
were
the
group
of
klamath
and
goose
lakes
lying
in
mid
plain
glassing
the
deep
upper
violet
farther
and
farther
from
our
mountain
base
in
that
direction
the
greenness
of
forest
and
meadow
fades
out
into
rich
mellow
brown
with
warm
cloudings
of
sienna
over
bare
lava
hills
and
shades
as
you
reach
the
eastern
limit
in
pale
ash
and
lavender
and
buff
where
stretches
of
level
land
slope
down
over
madelin
plains
into
nevada
deserts
an
unmistakable
purity
and
delicacy
of
tint
with
transparent
air
and
paleness
of
tone
give
all
desert
scenes
the
aspect
of
drawings
even
at
this
immense
distance
i
could
see
the
gradual
change
from
rich
warm
hues
of
rocky
slope
or
plain
overspread
with
ripened
vegetation
out
to
the
high
pale
key
of
the
desert
southeast
the
mountain
spurs
are
smoothed
into
a
broad
glacis
densely
overgrown
with
chaparral
and
ending
in
open
groves
around
plains
of
yellow
grass
a
little
farther
begin
the
wild
piles
of
green
mountains
which
represent
the
sierras
and
afar
towering
over
them
eighty
miles
away
the
lava
dome
of
lassen
s
peak
standing
up
bold
and
fine
south
the
sacramento
cañon
cuts
down
to
unseen
depths
its
deep
trough
opening
a
view
of
the
california
plain
a
brown
sunny
expanse
over
which
loom
in
vanishing
perspective
the
peaks
west
of
us
and
quite
around
the
of
view
stretches
a
vast
sea
of
ridges
chains
peaks
and
sharp
walls
of
cañons
as
wild
and
tumultuous
as
an
ocean
storm
here
and
there
above
the
blue
billows
rise
and
shaggy
but
the
topography
is
indistinguishable
with
difficulty
i
could
trace
for
a
short
distance
the
klamath
cañon
course
recognizing
siskiyou
peaks
where
professor
brewer
and
i
had
been
years
before
but
in
that
broad
area
no
further
unravelling
was
possible
so
high
is
shasta
so
dominant
above
the
field
of
view
we
looked
over
it
all
as
upon
a
great
shield
which
rose
gently
in
all
directions
to
the
sky
whichever
way
we
turned
the
great
cone
fell
off
from
our
feet
in
dizzying
abruptness
we
looked
down
steep
slopes
of
on
over
shattered
where
glaciers
roll
over
cliffs
and
around
the
whole
broad
massive
base
curved
deeply
through
its
lava
crusts
in
straight
cañons
these
flutings
of
ancient
and
grander
glaciers
are
flanked
by
straight
long
moraines
for
the
most
part
bare
but
reaching
down
part
way
into
the
forest
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
those
on
the
north
and
east
by
greater
massiveness
and
length
indicate
that
in
former
days
the
glacier
distribution
was
related
to
the
points
of
compass
about
as
it
is
now
what
volumes
of
geographical
history
lay
in
view
old
mountain
uplift
volcanoes
built
upon
the
plain
of
fiery
lava
the
chill
of
ice
and
wearing
force
of
torrent
written
in
and
cañon
i
think
such
vastness
of
prospect
now
and
then
extremely
valuable
in
itself
it
forcibly
widens
one
s
conception
of
country
driving
away
such
false
notion
of
extent
or
narrowing
idea
of
limitation
as
we
get
in
living
on
lower
plains
i
never
tire
of
overlooking
these
great
wide
fields
studying
their
rich
variety
and
giving
myself
up
to
the
expansion
which
is
the
instant
and
lasting
reward
in
presence
of
these
vast
spaces
and
all
but
unbounded
outlook
the
hours
hurry
by
with
singular
swiftness
minutes
or
miles
are
nothing
days
and
degrees
seem
best
fitted
for
one
s
thoughts
so
it
came
sooner
than
i
could
have
believed
that
the
sun
neared
its
setting
sinking
into
a
warm
bright
stratum
of
air
the
light
stretched
from
north
to
south
reflecting
itself
with
an
equal
depth
all
along
the
east
until
a
perfect
ring
of
soft
glowing
rose
edged
the
whole
horizon
over
us
the
heaven
hung
near
and
flat
light
swept
eastward
across
the
earth
every
uplift
of
or
solitary
cone
warm
and
bright
with
its
reflections
and
from
each
object
upon
the
plains
far
and
near
streamed
out
dense
sharp
shadows
slowly
lengthening
their
intense
images
we
were
far
enough
lifted
above
it
all
to
lose
the
ordinary
landscape
impression
and
reach
that
extraordinary
effect
of
topography
seen
upon
the
moon
through
a
telescope
afar
in
the
north
bars
of
blue
shadow
streamed
out
from
the
peaks
tracing
themselves
upon
rosy
air
all
the
eastern
slope
of
shasta
was
of
course
in
dark
shade
the
gray
glacier
forms
broken
ridges
of
stone
and
forest
all
dim
and
fading
a
long
cone
of
the
shadow
of
shasta
fell
strongly
defined
over
the
bright
plain
its
apex
darkening
the
earth
a
hundred
miles
away
as
the
sun
sank
this
gigantic
spectral
volcano
rose
on
the
warm
sky
till
its
darker
form
stood
huge
and
terrible
over
the
whole
east
it
was
intensely
distinct
at
the
summit
just
as
peaks
seen
against
the
east
in
evening
always
are
and
faded
at
base
as
it
entered
the
stratum
of
earth
mist
grand
and
impressive
we
had
thought
shasta
when
studying
in
similar
light
from
the
plain
infinitely
more
impressive
was
this
phantom
volcano
as
it
stood
overshadowing
the
land
and
slowly
fading
into
night
before
quitting
the
ridge
fred
clark
and
i
climbed
together
out
upon
the
highest
pinnacle
a
trachyte
needle
rising
a
few
feet
above
the
rest
and
so
small
we
could
barely
balance
there
together
but
we
stood
a
moment
and
waved
the
american
flag
looking
down
over
our
shoulders
eleven
thousand
feet
a
fierce
wind
blew
from
the
southwest
coming
in
gusts
of
great
force
below
we
could
hear
it
beat
upon
the
crags
we
hurried
down
to
the
flat
and
just
over
the
curve
of
its
southern
descent
made
our
bivouac
even
here
the
wind
howled
merciless
and
cold
we
turned
to
and
built
of
lava
blocks
a
square
pen
about
two
and
a
half
feet
high
filled
the
chinks
with
pebbles
and
banked
it
with
sand
i
have
seen
other
fronts
more
imposing
than
our
shasta
home
but
i
have
rarely
felt
more
grateful
to
four
walls
than
to
that
little
pen
i
have
not
forgotten
that
through
its
chinks
the
sand
and
pebbles
pelted
us
all
night
nor
was
i
oblivious
when
sudden
gusts
toppled
over
here
and
there
a
rock
upon
our
feet
when
we
sat
up
for
our
cup
of
coffee
which
clark
artistically
concocted
over
the
scanty
and
economical
fire
the
walls
sheltered
our
backs
and
for
that
we
were
thankful
even
if
the
wind
had
full
sweep
at
our
heads
and
stole
the
very
draught
from
our
lips
whirling
it
about
north
forty
east
by
compass
in
the
form
of
an
infinitesimal
spray
the
zephyr
as
we
courteously
called
it
had
a
fashion
of
dropping
vertically
out
of
the
sky
upon
our
fire
and
leaving
a
clean
hearth
for
the
space
of
a
few
moments
after
these
meteorological
jokes
there
was
a
lively
gathering
of
burning
knots
from
among
our
legs
and
coats
and
blankets
there
are
times
when
the
extreme
of
discomfort
so
overdoes
itself
as
to
extort
a
laugh
and
put
one
in
the
best
of
humor
this
tempest
descended
to
so
many
absurd
personal
tricks
altogether
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
reputable
hurricane
that
at
last
it
seemed
to
us
a
sort
of
furious
burlesque
not
so
the
cold
that
commanded
entire
respect
whether
carefully
abstracting
our
animal
heat
through
the
bed
of
gravel
on
which
we
lay
or
brooding
over
us
hungry
for
those
pleasant
little
waves
of
motion
which
taking
tyndall
for
granted
radiated
all
night
long
in
spite
of
wildcat
bags
from
our
unwilling
particles
i
abominate
thermometers
at
such
times
not
one
of
my
set
ever
owned
up
the
real
state
of
things
whenever
i
am
nearly
frozen
and
conscious
of
every
indurated
bone
that
bland
little
instrument
is
sure
to
read
twenty
or
thirty
degrees
above
any
unprejudiced
estimate
lying
there
and
listening
to
the
whispering
sounds
that
kindly
drifted
ever
adding
to
our
cover
and
speculating
as
to
any
further
possible
meteorological
affliction
was
but
indifferent
amusement
from
which
i
escaped
to
a
slumber
of
great
industry
we
lay
like
sardines
hoping
to
encourage
animal
heat
but
with
small
success
the
sunrise
effect
with
all
its
splendor
i
find
it
convenient
to
leave
to
some
future
traveller
i
shall
be
generous
with
him
and
say
nothing
of
that
hour
of
gold
it
had
occurred
long
before
we
awoke
and
many
precious
minutes
were
consumed
in
united
appeals
to
one
another
to
get
up
and
make
coffee
it
was
horridly
cold
and
uncomfortable
where
we
were
but
no
one
stirred
how
natural
it
is
under
such
circumstances
to
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
i
lay
musing
on
this
finding
it
singular
that
i
should
rather
be
there
stiff
and
cold
while
my
comrades
appealed
to
me
than
to
get
up
and
comfort
myself
with
and
breakfast
we
severally
awaited
developments
at
last
clark
gave
up
and
made
the
fire
and
he
has
left
me
in
doubt
whether
he
loved
cold
less
or
coffee
more
digging
out
our
breakfast
from
drifted
sand
was
pleasant
enough
nor
did
we
object
to
excavating
the
frozen
shoes
but
the
mixture
of
disintegrated
trachyte
discovered
among
the
sugar
and
the
manner
in
which
our
front
had
blown
over
and
flattened
out
the
family
provisions
were
received
by
us
as
calamity
however
we
did
justice
to
clark
s
coffee
and
socially
toasted
our
bits
of
meat
while
we
chatted
and
ate
zestfully
portions
not
too
freely
brecciated
with
lava
sand
i
have
been
at
times
all
but
morbidly
aware
of
the
power
of
local
attachment
finding
it
absurdly
hard
to
turn
the
key
on
doors
i
have
entered
often
and
with
pleasure
my
own
early
home
though
in
other
hands
holds
its
own
against
greater
comfort
larger
cheer
and
a
hundred
times
when
our
little
train
moved
away
from
grand
old
trees
or
springs
by
mountain
camps
i
have
felt
all
the
pathos
of
nomadism
from
the
aryan
migration
down
as
we
shouldered
our
loads
and
took
to
the
i
looked
back
on
our
modest
edifice
and
for
the
first
time
left
my
camp
with
gay
relief
elation
of
success
and
the
vital
mountain
air
lent
us
their
quickening
impulse
we
tramped
rapidly
across
the
and
down
a
long
spur
of
red
trachyte
which
extended
in
a
southerly
course
around
the
head
of
a
glacier
it
was
our
purpose
to
descend
the
southern
slope
of
the
mountain
to
a
camp
which
had
been
left
there
awaiting
us
the
declivity
in
that
direction
is
more
gentle
than
by
our
former
trail
and
had
besides
the
merit
of
lying
open
to
our
view
almost
from
the
very
start
it
was
interesting
as
we
followed
the
red
trachyte
spur
to
look
down
to
our
left
upon
of
the
mccloud
glacier
from
its
very
head
dislocation
and
crevasses
had
begun
the
whole
mass
moving
away
from
the
wall
leaving
a
deep
gap
between
ice
and
rock
in
its
further
descent
this
glacier
pours
over
such
steep
cascades
and
is
so
tortuous
among
the
lava
crags
that
we
could
only
see
its
beginning
to
avoid
those
great
pyramidal
masses
which
sprang
fully
a
thousand
feet
from
the
general
flank
of
the
mountain
we
turned
to
the
right
and
entered
the
head
of
one
of
those
long
eroded
glacier
cañons
which
are
scored
down
the
slope
the
ridges
from
both
sides
had
poured
in
their
freight
of
until
the
cañon
was
one
mass
of
rock
fragments
of
every
conceivable
size
and
shape
here
and
there
considerable
masses
of
ice
and
relics
of
former
glaciers
lay
up
and
down
the
shaded
sides
and
as
we
descended
occupied
the
whole
broad
bottom
of
the
gorge
we
congratulated
ourselves
when
the
steep
upper
slope
was
passed
and
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
wavy
ice
of
the
old
glacier
numerous
streams
flowed
over
its
irregular
face
losing
themselves
in
the
cracks
and
reappearing
among
the
accumulation
of
bowlders
upon
its
surface
here
and
there
glacier
tables
of
considerable
size
rose
above
the
general
level
supported
on
slender
as
the
angle
here
was
very
steep
we
amused
ourselves
by
prying
these
off
their
pedestals
with
our
alpine
stocks
and
watching
them
slide
down
before
us
more
and
more
the
ice
became
burdened
with
rocks
until
at
last
it
wholly
disappeared
under
accumulation
of
moraine
over
this
for
a
half
mile
we
tramped
thinking
the
glacier
ended
but
in
one
or
two
depressions
i
again
caught
sight
of
the
ice
which
led
me
to
believe
that
a
very
large
portion
of
this
rocky
gorge
may
be
underlaid
by
old
glacial
remains
tramping
over
this
unstable
moraine
where
melting
ice
had
left
the
bowlders
in
every
state
of
uncertain
equilibrium
we
were
greatly
fatigued
and
at
last
the
strain
telling
seriously
on
our
legs
we
climbed
over
a
ridge
to
the
left
of
our
amphitheatre
into
the
next
cañon
which
was
very
broad
and
open
with
gentle
undulating
surface
diversified
by
rock
plateaus
and
fields
of
glacier
sand
here
by
the
margin
of
a
little
and
among
piles
of
immense
emmons
and
i
sat
down
to
lunch
and
rested
until
our
friends
came
up
a
few
scanty
bunches
of
alpine
plants
began
to
deck
the
gray
earth
and
gradually
to
gather
themselves
in
bits
of
open
sward
here
and
there
decorated
with
delicate
flowers
near
one
little
spring
meadow
we
came
upon
gardens
of
a
pale
yellow
flower
with
an
agreeable
aromatic
perfume
and
after
another
mile
of
straining
on
among
erratic
bowlders
and
over
the
rock
of
the
old
moraines
we
came
to
the
advanced
guard
of
the
forest
and
gnarled
old
specimens
of
trees
of
rugged
muscular
trunk
and
scanty
irregular
branch
they
showed
in
every
line
and
color
a
struggle
against
their
enemies
the
avalanche
and
cold
gathering
closer
they
grew
in
groves
separated
by
long
open
grassy
glades
the
clumps
of
trees
twisting
their
roots
among
the
glacier
blocks
for
a
long
time
we
followed
the
pathway
of
an
avalanche
to
the
right
and
left
of
us
upon
considerable
heights
the
trees
were
sound
and
whole
and
preserved
even
at
their
ripe
age
the
health
of
youth
but
down
the
straight
pathway
of
the
valley
every
tree
had
been
swept
away
the
prostrate
trunks
lying
here
and
there
half
buried
in
drifts
of
sand
and
rock
here
over
the
whole
surface
a
fresh
young
growth
not
more
than
six
or
seven
years
old
has
sprung
up
and
begun
a
hopeless
struggle
for
ground
which
the
snow
claims
for
its
own
before
us
opened
winding
avenues
through
forest
green
meadows
spread
their
pale
fresh
herbage
in
sunny
beauty
along
the
little
stream
which
after
a
mile
s
musical
cascades
we
knew
flowed
past
camp
tender
green
plants
and
frail
mountain
flowers
edged
our
pathway
all
was
still
and
peaceful
with
the
soft
brooding
spirit
of
life
the
groves
were
absolutely
alive
like
ourselves
and
drinking
in
the
broad
affluent
light
in
their
silent
beautiful
way
back
over
sunny
the
great
cone
of
rock
and
ice
loomed
in
the
cold
blue
but
we
gladly
turned
away
and
let
our
hearts
open
to
the
gentle
influence
of
our
new
world
there
at
last
as
we
tramped
over
a
knoll
were
the
mules
dozing
in
sunshine
or
idling
about
among
trees
and
there
that
dear
blue
wreath
floating
up
from
our
and
drifting
softly
among
boughs
of
overhanging
fir
i
always
feel
a
strange
renewal
of
life
when
i
come
down
from
one
of
these
climbs
they
are
with
me
points
of
departure
more
marked
and
powerful
than
i
can
account
for
upon
any
reasonable
ground
in
spite
of
any
scientific
labor
or
presence
of
fatigue
the
lifeless
region
with
its
savage
elements
of
sky
ice
and
rock
grasps
one
s
nature
and
whether
he
will
or
no
compels
it
into
a
stern
strong
accord
then
as
you
come
again
into
softer
air
and
enter
the
comforting
presence
of
trees
and
feel
the
grass
under
your
feet
one
fetter
after
another
seems
to
unbind
from
your
soul
leaving
it
free
joyous
grateful
xii
shasta
flanks
there
are
certain
women
i
am
informed
who
place
men
under
their
spell
without
leaving
them
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
understanding
how
the
thing
was
done
they
may
have
absolutely
repulsive
features
and
a
pretty
permanent
absence
of
mind
without
that
charm
of
cheerful
grace
before
which
we
are
said
to
succumb
yet
they
manage
to
assume
command
of
certain
it
is
thus
with
mules
i
have
heard
them
called
awkward
and
personally
plain
nor
is
it
denied
that
their
disposition
though
rich
in
individuality
lacks
some
measure
of
qualities
which
should
endear
them
to
humanity
despite
all
this
and
even
more
they
have
a
way
of
tenderly
getting
the
better
of
us
and
in
the
long
run
absolutely
enthroning
themselves
in
our
affections
mystery
as
it
is
i
confess
to
its
potent
sway
long
ago
owning
it
beyond
solution
live
on
the
intimate
terms
of
with
your
mule
be
thoughtful
for
his
welfare
and
you
take
an
emotional
start
toward
him
which
will
surprise
you
you
look
into
that
reserved
face
the
embodiment
of
drollery
and
begin
to
detect
soft
thought
and
tender
feeling
and
sometimes
as
you
cinch
your
saddle
a
little
severely
the
calm
reproachful
visage
will
swing
round
and
melt
you
with
a
single
look
nothing
is
left
but
to
rub
the
velvet
nose
and
loosen
up
the
girth
when
the
mere
brightness
and
gayety
of
mountain
life
carries
one
away
with
their
hilarious
current
there
is
something
in
the
meek
and
humble
air
of
a
lot
of
pack
animals
altogether
chastening
in
its
prompt
effect
my
was
one
of
these
insidious
beings
who
within
a
week
of
our
first
meeting
asserted
supremacy
over
my
life
and
formed
a
silent
partnership
with
my
conscience
she
was
a
chubby
black
mule
so
sleek
and
rotund
as
distantly
to
suggest
a
pig
on
stilts
upon
the
eye
which
still
remained
a
cataract
had
begun
to
spread
its
dimming
film
her
was
also
defective
in
a
weak
pair
of
hind
legs
which
gave
way
suddenly
in
going
up
steep
places
she
was
clumsy
and
in
rugged
pathways
would
squander
much
time
in
the
selection
of
her
foothold
at
these
moments
when
she
deliberated
as
i
fancied
needlessly
long
i
have
very
gently
suggested
with
spanish
spur
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
start
the
serious
face
then
turned
upon
me
its
mild
eye
looking
into
mine
one
long
earnest
gaze
as
much
as
to
say
i
love
and
would
spare
you
remember
balaam
i
yielded
these
animals
are
always
of
the
opposition
party
they
reverse
your
wishes
and
from
one
year
s
end
to
another
defy
your
best
judgment
yet
i
love
them
and
only
in
extreme
moments
go
for
them
with
a
or
nothing
can
be
pleasanter
than
to
ride
them
through
forest
roads
chatting
in
a
bright
company
and
catching
glimpses
of
far
quiet
scenery
framed
by
the
long
furry
ears
so
we
thought
on
that
sunny
morning
when
we
left
sisson
s
starting
ahead
of
wagons
and
pack
animals
and
riding
out
into
the
woodland
on
our
trip
round
shasta
a
march
of
a
hundred
miles
with
many
proposed
into
the
mountain
the
california
haze
had
again
enveloped
shasta
this
time
nearly
obscuring
it
in
forest
along
the
southeast
base
we
came
upon
the
stream
flowing
from
mccloud
glacier
its
cold
waters
milky
white
with
fine
sandy
sediment
such
dense
impenetrable
fields
of
chaparral
cover
the
south
foothills
that
we
were
only
able
to
fight
our
way
through
limited
parts
getting
however
a
clear
idea
of
lava
flows
and
topography
farther
east
the
plains
rise
to
seven
thousand
feet
and
fine
wood
ridges
sweep
down
from
shasta
inviting
approach
while
munger
and
watkins
camped
to
make
studies
and
negatives
of
the
peak
fred
clark
and
i
packed
one
mule
with
a
week
s
provisions
and
mounting
our
struck
off
into
dark
silent
forest
it
was
a
steep
climb
of
eight
or
ten
miles
up
ridges
and
among
outcrops
of
gray
trachyte
nearly
every
foot
showing
more
or
less
evidence
of
glacial
action
long
trains
of
morainal
rocks
upon
which
large
seemed
satisfied
to
grow
great
rough
regions
of
terminal
rubbish
with
enclosed
patches
of
level
earth
commonly
and
picturesque
it
was
sunset
before
we
came
upon
water
and
then
it
flowed
a
thousand
feet
below
us
in
the
bottom
of
a
sharp
narrow
cañon
cut
abruptly
down
in
what
seemed
glacial
i
thought
it
unwise
to
take
our
mules
down
its
steep
wall
if
there
were
any
high
up
in
the
opener
head
of
the
cañon
and
went
off
on
foot
to
climb
the
wooded
moraines
still
farther
hoping
to
come
upon
a
bit
of
alpine
sward
with
icy
pool
or
even
upon
a
spring
when
up
between
two
and
three
hundred
feet
the
trees
became
less
and
less
frequent
rugged
trains
of
stone
and
rock
in
places
covering
the
spurs
i
could
now
overlook
the
snow
amphitheatre
which
opened
vast
and
shadowy
above
not
a
sign
of
vegetation
enlivened
its
stony
bed
the
icy
brook
flowed
between
slopes
of
at
my
feet
a
trachyte
ridge
narrowed
the
stream
with
a
tortuous
bed
and
led
it
to
the
edge
of
a
cliff
over
which
poured
a
graceful
cascade
finding
no
there
i
turned
northward
and
made
a
detour
through
deep
woods
coming
back
to
clark
we
faced
the
necessity
and
by
dark
were
snugly
camped
in
the
wild
cañon
bottom
it
was
one
of
the
loneliest
bivouacs
of
my
life
shut
in
by
high
dark
walls
a
few
clustered
trees
growing
here
and
there
others
which
floods
had
undermined
lying
prostrate
rough
bowlders
thrown
about
an
icy
stream
hurrying
by
and
chilly
winds
coming
down
from
the
height
against
which
our
blankets
only
half
defended
us
our
excursion
next
day
was
south
and
west
across
high
scantily
wooded
moraines
till
we
came
to
the
deep
cañon
of
the
mccloud
glacier
i
describe
this
gorge
as
it
is
one
of
several
similar
all
peculiar
to
shasta
we
had
climbed
to
a
point
about
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
were
upon
the
eastern
edge
of
a
cañon
of
eleven
or
twelve
hundred
feet
depth
from
the
very
crest
of
the
shasta
with
here
and
there
a
few
patches
of
snow
a
long
and
remarkably
even
slope
swept
down
it
seemed
as
if
these
small
pieces
of
trachyte
formed
a
great
part
of
the
region
for
to
the
very
bottom
our
cañon
walls
were
worked
out
of
it
a
half
mile
below
us
the
left
bank
was
curiously
eroded
by
side
streams
resulting
in
a
family
of
pillars
from
one
to
seven
hundred
feet
high
each
capped
with
some
hard
lava
bowlder
which
had
protected
the
soft
beneath
from
weathering
from
its
lofty
the
mccloud
glacier
descended
over
rugged
slopes
in
one
long
cascade
to
a
little
above
our
station
where
it
impinged
against
a
great
rock
buttress
and
turned
sharply
from
the
south
wall
toward
us
rounding
over
in
a
great
solid
eight
or
nine
hundred
feet
high
for
a
mile
farther
a
huge
accumulation
looking
like
a
river
of
cumbered
the
bottom
here
and
there
on
close
scrutiny
we
found
it
to
be
pierced
with
caverns
whose
showed
that
the
glacier
underlay
all
this
vast
amount
of
stone
bowlders
rattled
continually
from
the
upper
glacier
and
down
both
cañon
walls
increasing
the
already
great
burden
along
both
sides
were
evidences
of
motion
in
the
lateral
moraine
embankments
and
a
very
perceptible
rounding
up
of
terminal
ramparts
from
which
in
white
torrent
poured
the
brook
it
is
instructive
to
consider
what
an
amount
of
freighting
labor
this
shrunken
has
to
perform
besides
dragging
its
own
vast
weight
along
in
descending
shasta
we
had
found
glacial
ice
which
evidently
for
a
mile
or
more
deeply
underlaid
a
mass
of
rock
similar
to
this
it
is
one
of
the
curiosities
of
mount
shasta
that
such
a
great
bulk
of
ice
should
be
buried
and
in
large
part
preserved
by
loads
of
rock
fragments
fine
contrasts
of
color
were
afforded
high
up
among
the
by
a
combination
of
blue
ice
and
red
lavas
we
hammered
and
surveyed
here
for
half
the
day
then
descended
to
our
mules
who
bore
us
eagerly
back
to
their
home
our
weird
little
cañon
camp
a
pleasant
day
s
march
altogether
in
woods
and
over
glacial
ridges
during
which
not
a
half
hour
passed
without
opening
views
of
the
cone
brought
us
high
on
the
northern
slope
at
the
upper
forest
limit
in
a
region
of
barren
avalanche
tracks
and
immense
moraines
between
those
great
straight
ridges
which
jut
almost
parallel
from
the
volcano
s
base
are
wide
shelving
valleys
the
pathways
of
extinct
glaciers
and
here
the
forest
although
it
must
once
have
obtained
foothold
has
been
uprooted
and
swept
away
before
powerful
avalanches
crushed
and
trunks
in
sad
wreck
marking
spots
where
the
stopped
two
brooks
separated
by
a
wide
gently
rounding
zone
of
drift
flowed
down
through
the
glacier
valley
which
opened
directly
in
front
of
our
camp
early
next
morning
clark
and
i
made
up
a
bag
of
lunch
shouldered
our
instruments
and
set
out
for
a
day
on
the
glacier
our
slow
laborious
ascent
of
the
valley
was
not
altogether
uninteresting
constant
views
obtained
of
moraines
on
either
side
gave
us
much
pleasure
and
study
it
was
instructive
to
observe
that
the
bases
of
their
structure
were
solid
floors
of
lava
upon
which
in
rude
though
secure
masonry
were
piled
embankments
not
less
than
half
a
mile
wide
and
four
hundred
feet
high
among
the
huge
rocks
which
formed
the
upper
structure
the
were
peculiar
apparently
every
tree
had
made
an
effort
to
fill
some
gap
and
round
out
the
smooth
general
surface
no
matter
how
deeply
twisted
between
high
bowlders
the
branches
spread
themselves
out
in
a
continuous
dense
mat
stretching
from
stone
to
stone
it
was
only
rarely
and
in
the
less
elevated
parts
of
the
moraine
that
we
could
see
a
trunk
the
whole
effect
was
of
a
causeway
of
rock
overgrown
by
some
dense
green
vine
similar
patches
of
stunted
trees
grew
here
and
there
over
the
bottom
of
our
broad
amphitheatre
oftentimes
we
threaded
our
way
among
dense
thickets
of
pines
never
over
six
or
eight
feet
in
height
having
trunks
often
two
and
three
feet
in
diameter
and
more
than
once
we
walked
over
their
tops
our
feet
sinking
but
two
or
three
inches
into
the
dense
mat
of
foliage
here
and
there
half
buried
in
the
drift
we
came
across
the
tall
noble
trunks
of
trees
in
comparing
their
straight
symmetrical
growth
with
the
singularly
matted
condition
of
the
trees
i
find
the
indication
of
a
great
climatic
change
not
only
are
the
present
avalanches
too
great
to
permit
their
growth
but
the
violent
cold
winds
which
drift
over
this
region
bend
down
the
young
trees
to
such
an
extent
that
there
are
no
longer
tall
normal
specimens
around
the
upper
limits
of
aborescent
vegetation
we
passed
some
most
enchanting
spots
groves
not
over
eight
feet
in
height
of
large
trees
whose
white
trunks
and
interwoven
boughs
formed
a
colonnade
over
which
stretched
thick
living
thatch
under
these
strange
galleries
we
walked
upon
soft
velvety
turf
and
an
elastic
cushion
of
nor
could
we
resist
the
temptation
of
lying
down
here
to
rest
beneath
the
dense
roof
as
we
looked
back
charming
little
vistas
opened
between
the
old
and
dwarfed
stems
in
one
direction
we
could
see
the
moraine
with
its
long
graded
slope
and
variegated
green
and
brown
surface
in
another
the
open
pathway
of
the
old
glacier
worn
deeper
and
deeper
between
lofty
spurs
and
up
to
the
great
snow
mass
above
us
with
its
slender
peak
in
the
heavens
looking
down
upon
magnificent
sweep
of
only
the
strong
desire
for
glaciers
led
us
away
from
these
delightful
groves
a
short
tramp
over
sand
and
bowlders
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
a
broad
irregular
terminal
moraine
two
or
three
milky
cascades
poured
out
from
under
the
great
bowlder
region
and
united
to
form
two
important
streams
we
followed
one
of
these
in
our
climb
up
the
moraine
and
after
an
hour
s
hard
work
found
ourselves
upon
an
immense
pile
of
lava
blocks
from
which
we
could
overlook
the
whole
in
irregular
curve
it
continues
not
less
than
three
miles
around
the
end
of
the
glacier
and
in
no
place
that
i
saw
was
less
than
a
half
mile
in
width
where
we
had
attacked
it
the
width
can
not
be
less
than
a
mile
and
the
portion
over
which
we
had
climbed
must
reach
a
thickness
of
five
or
six
hundred
feet
about
a
half
mile
above
us
though
but
little
lifted
from
our
level
undulating
hillocks
of
ice
marked
the
division
between
glacier
and
moraine
above
that
it
stretched
in
uninterrupted
white
fields
the
moraine
in
every
direction
extended
in
singularly
abrupt
hills
separated
by
deep
irregular
pits
and
basins
of
a
hundred
and
more
feet
deep
as
we
climbed
on
the
footing
became
more
and
more
insecure
piles
of
rock
giving
way
under
our
weight
before
long
we
came
to
a
region
of
circular
craters
where
evidently
the
underlying
glacier
had
melted
out
and
a
whole
freight
of
bowlders
fallen
in
with
a
rush
around
the
edges
of
these
horrible
traps
we
threaded
our
way
with
extreme
caution
now
and
then
a
bowlder
dislodging
under
our
feet
rolled
down
into
these
pits
and
many
tons
would
settle
out
of
sight
altogether
it
was
the
most
dangerous
kind
of
climbing
i
have
ever
seen
you
were
never
sure
of
your
foothold
more
than
once
when
crossing
a
comparatively
smooth
level
the
rocks
began
to
sink
under
us
and
we
sprang
on
from
stone
to
stone
while
the
great
mass
caved
and
sank
slowly
behind
us
at
times
while
making
our
way
over
stretches
the
sound
of
a
deep
stream
flowing
far
beneath
us
came
up
faint
and
muffled
through
the
chinks
of
the
rock
this
sort
of
music
is
not
encouraging
to
the
nerves
to
the
siren
babble
of
mountain
brook
is
added
all
the
tragic
nearness
of
death
we
looked
far
and
wide
in
hope
of
some
solid
region
which
should
lead
us
up
to
the
ice
but
it
was
all
alike
and
we
hurried
on
the
rocks
settling
and
sinking
beneath
our
tread
until
we
made
our
way
to
the
edge
and
climbed
with
relief
upon
the
hard
white
surface
after
we
had
gained
the
height
of
a
hundred
feet
climbing
up
a
comparatively
smooth
slope
between
brooks
which
flowed
over
it
a
look
back
gave
a
more
correct
idea
of
the
general
billowy
character
of
our
moraine
and
here
and
there
in
its
deeper
indentations
we
could
detect
the
underlying
ice
it
is
then
here
as
upon
the
mccloud
glacier
for
at
least
a
mile
s
width
the
whole
lower
zone
is
buried
under
accumulation
of
morainal
matter
instead
of
ending
like
most
swiss
glaciers
this
ice
wastes
chiefly
in
contact
with
the
ground
and
when
considerable
caverns
are
formed
the
overlying
moraine
crushes
its
way
through
the
rotten
roof
making
the
funnels
we
had
seen
thankful
that
we
had
not
assisted
at
one
of
these
engulfments
we
scrambled
on
up
the
smooth
slope
steadying
our
ascent
by
the
tripod
legs
used
as
alpine
stock
when
we
had
climbed
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
the
surface
angle
became
somewhat
gentler
and
we
were
able
to
overlook
before
us
the
whole
broad
incline
up
to
the
very
peak
for
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
the
sharp
blue
edges
of
crevasses
were
apparent
here
and
there
yawning
widely
for
the
length
of
a
thousand
feet
and
at
other
places
intersecting
each
other
confusedly
resulting
in
masses
of
shattered
ice
we
were
charmed
to
enter
this
wild
region
and
hurried
to
the
edge
of
an
immense
chasm
it
could
hardly
have
been
less
than
a
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
feet
in
length
the
solid
white
wall
of
the
opposite
side
sixty
feet
over
fell
smooth
and
vertical
for
a
hundred
feet
or
more
where
rough
wedged
blocks
and
bridges
of
clear
blue
ice
stretched
from
wall
to
wall
from
these
and
from
numerous
overhanging
shelves
hung
the
long
crystal
threads
of
icicles
and
beyond
dark
and
impenetrable
opened
of
unknown
limit
we
cautiously
walked
along
this
brink
examining
with
deep
interest
all
the
lines
of
stratification
and
veining
and
the
strange
succession
of
views
down
into
the
fractured
regions
below
i
had
the
greatest
desire
to
be
let
down
with
a
line
and
make
my
way
among
these
pillars
and
bridges
of
ice
but
our
little
twenty
feet
of
slender
rope
forbade
the
attempt
farther
up
the
crevasses
walled
us
about
more
and
more
at
last
we
got
into
a
region
where
they
cut
into
one
another
breaking
the
whole
glacier
body
into
a
confused
pile
of
ice
blocks
here
we
had
great
difficulty
in
seeing
our
way
for
more
than
a
very
few
feet
and
were
constantly
obliged
to
climb
to
the
top
of
some
dangerous
block
to
get
an
outlook
and
before
long
instead
of
a
plain
with
here
and
there
a
crevasse
we
were
in
a
mass
of
crevasses
separated
only
by
thin
and
dangerous
blades
of
ice
we
still
pushed
on
tied
together
with
our
short
line
jumping
over
pits
and
chasms
holding
our
breath
over
slender
and
beginning
to
think
the
work
serious
we
climbed
an
together
all
around
rose
strange
sharp
forms
below
in
every
direction
yawned
narrow
cuts
caves
trimmed
with
long
stalactites
of
ice
walls
ornamented
with
crystal
pilasters
and
grottoes
opening
down
into
deeper
and
more
gloomy
chambers
as
silent
and
cold
as
graves
far
above
the
summit
rose
white
and
symmetrical
its
sky
line
sweeping
down
sharp
against
the
blue
below
over
and
frozen
waves
opened
the
deep
valley
of
our
camp
leading
our
vision
down
to
distant
forest
slopes
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
vast
convex
glacier
surface
which
embraced
the
curve
of
shasta
for
four
miles
around
and
at
least
five
on
the
slope
line
ice
stretching
in
every
direction
and
actually
bounding
the
view
on
all
sides
except
where
we
looked
down
the
idea
of
a
mountain
glacier
formed
from
swiss
or
indian
views
is
always
of
a
stream
of
ice
walled
in
by
more
or
less
lofty
ridges
here
a
great
curved
cover
of
ice
flows
down
the
conical
surface
of
a
volcano
without
lateral
walls
a
few
lava
pinnacles
and
inconspicuous
piles
of
separating
it
from
the
next
glacier
but
they
were
unseen
from
our
point
sharp
white
profiles
met
the
sky
it
became
evident
we
could
go
no
farther
in
the
old
direction
and
we
at
once
set
about
retracing
our
steps
but
in
the
labyrinth
soon
lost
the
barely
discernible
tracks
and
never
refound
them
whichever
way
we
turned
impassable
gulfs
opened
before
us
but
just
a
little
way
to
the
right
or
left
it
seemed
safe
and
traversable
at
last
i
got
provoked
at
the
and
suggested
to
clark
that
we
might
with
advantage
take
a
brief
intermission
for
lunch
feeling
that
a
lately
quieted
stomach
is
the
best
defence
for
nerves
so
when
we
got
into
a
pleasant
open
spot
where
the
glacier
became
for
a
little
way
smooth
and
level
we
sat
down
leisurely
enjoying
our
repast
we
saw
a
possible
way
out
of
our
difficulty
and
sat
some
time
chatting
pleasantly
when
there
was
no
more
lunch
we
started
again
and
only
three
steps
away
came
upon
a
narrow
crack
edged
by
sharp
there
was
something
noticeable
in
the
hollow
bottomless
darkness
seen
through
it
which
arrested
us
and
when
we
had
jumped
across
to
the
other
side
both
knelt
and
looked
into
its
depths
we
saw
a
large
domed
grotto
walled
in
with
shattered
ice
and
arched
over
by
a
roof
of
frozen
snow
so
thin
that
the
light
came
through
quite
easily
the
middle
of
this
dome
overhung
a
terrible
abyss
a
block
of
ice
thrown
in
fell
from
ledge
to
ledge
echoing
back
its
stroke
fainter
and
fainter
we
had
unconsciously
sat
for
twenty
minutes
lunching
and
laughing
on
the
thin
roof
with
only
a
few
inches
of
frozen
snow
to
hold
us
up
over
that
still
deep
grave
a
noonday
sun
rapidly
melting
its
surface
the
warmth
of
our
persons
slowly
thawing
it
and
both
of
us
playfully
drumming
the
frail
crest
with
our
tripod
legs
we
looked
at
one
another
and
agreed
that
we
had
lost
confidence
in
glaciers
splendid
rifts
now
opened
to
north
of
us
with
slant
sunshine
lighting
up
one
side
in
vivid
contrast
with
the
cold
shadowed
wall
we
greatly
enjoyed
a
tall
precipice
with
a
gaping
crevasse
at
its
base
and
found
real
pleasure
in
the
north
edge
of
the
great
whither
we
now
turned
a
low
moraine
with
here
and
there
a
mass
of
rock
which
might
be
solid
flanked
the
glacier
but
was
separated
from
it
by
a
deeply
melted
crevasse
opening
irregular
caverns
along
the
wall
down
under
the
very
glacier
body
we
were
some
time
searching
a
point
where
this
gulf
might
be
safely
crossed
a
thin
tongue
of
ice
sharpened
by
melting
to
a
mere
blade
jutted
from
the
solid
glacier
over
to
the
moraine
offering
us
a
passage
of
some
danger
and
much
interest
we
edged
our
way
along
astride
its
crest
until
a
good
spring
carried
us
over
a
final
crevasse
and
up
upon
the
moraine
which
we
found
to
be
dangerously
built
up
of
honeycombed
ice
and
bowlders
the
same
perilous
sinks
and
holes
surrounded
us
and
alternated
with
hollow
archways
over
subterranean
streams
it
was
a
relief
after
an
hour
s
labor
to
find
ourselves
on
solid
lava
although
the
ridge
which
proved
to
be
a
chain
of
old
craters
was
one
of
the
most
dreary
reaches
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
evidence
of
glacier
motion
there
had
seemed
a
form
of
life
but
here
among
silent
rigid
crater
rims
and
stark
fields
of
volcanic
sand
we
walked
upon
ground
lifeless
and
lonely
beyond
description
a
frozen
desert
at
nine
thousand
feet
altitude
among
the
huge
rude
forms
of
lava
we
tramped
along
happy
when
the
tracks
of
mountain
sheep
suggested
former
explorers
and
pleased
if
a
under
rock
shadow
gave
birth
to
spring
or
pool
but
the
severe
impression
of
arctic
dreariness
passed
off
when
reaching
a
rim
we
looked
over
and
down
upon
the
volcano
s
north
foot
a
superb
sweep
of
forest
country
waved
with
ridgy
flow
of
lava
and
gracefully
curved
moraines
afar
off
the
wide
sunny
shasta
valley
dotted
with
miniature
volcanoes
and
checked
with
the
yellow
and
green
of
grain
and
garden
spread
pleasantly
away
to
the
north
bounded
by
clamath
hills
and
horizoned
by
the
blue
rank
of
siskiyou
mountains
to
our
left
the
cone
slope
stretched
away
to
sisson
s
the
sharp
form
of
the
black
cone
rising
in
the
gap
between
shasta
and
scott
mountain
here
again
the
tremendous
contrast
between
lava
and
ice
about
us
and
that
lovely
expanse
of
ranches
and
verdure
impressed
anew
its
peculiar
force
we
tramped
on
along
the
glacier
edge
over
rough
ridges
and
slopes
of
old
moraine
rounding
at
last
the
ice
terminus
and
crossing
the
valley
to
camp
where
our
three
mules
welcomed
us
with
friendly
discord
a
day
s
march
over
moraines
and
through
open
glades
brought
us
to
the
main
camp
at
sheep
rock
uniting
us
with
our
friends
the
heavier
air
of
this
lower
level
soothed
us
into
a
pleasant
laziness
which
lasted
over
sunday
resting
our
strained
muscles
and
opening
the
heart
anew
to
human
and
sacred
influence
if
we
are
sometimes
at
pain
when
realizing
within
what
narrow
range
of
latitude
mankind
reaches
finer
development
how
short
a
step
it
is
from
tropical
absence
of
spiritual
life
to
dull
boreal
stupidity
it
is
added
humiliation
to
experience
our
marked
limitation
in
altitude
at
fourteen
thousand
feet
little
is
left
me
but
bodily
appetite
and
impression
of
sense
the
habit
of
scientific
observation
which
in
time
becomes
one
of
the
involuntary
processes
goes
on
as
do
and
breathing
a
certain
general
awe
overshadows
the
mind
but
on
descending
again
to
lowlands
one
after
another
the
whole
riches
of
the
human
organization
come
back
with
delicious
freshness
something
of
this
must
account
for
my
delight
in
finding
the
family
of
preuxtemps
a
mountaineer
known
hereabouts
as
camped
near
us
was
a
barbarian
by
choice
and
united
all
the
wilder
instincts
with
a
domestic
passion
worthy
his
caucasian
ancestor
and
quite
charming
in
its
childlike
manifestation
protem
an
obese
digger
squaw
so
evidently
avoided
us
that
i
respected
her
feelings
and
never
once
visited
their
bivouac
although
the
flutter
of
gaudy
rags
and
that
picturesque
squalor
of
which
she
and
the
were
centre
and
soul
sorely
tempted
me
the
old
man
and
his
four
little
barefoot
girls
if
not
actually
familiar
were
more
than
sociable
and
spent
much
time
with
us
the
elder
three
ranging
from
eight
to
twelve
were
shy
and
timid
as
little
quails
dodging
about
and
scampering
off
to
some
when
i
strove
to
introduce
myself
through
the
medium
of
such
massive
as
our
william
produced
not
so
the
little
clarissa
who
in
all
frankness
met
my
advances
and
repaid
me
for
the
cookies
she
silently
devoured
by
gentlest
and
most
fascinating
smiles
a
stained
and
rudely
gathered
into
a
band
was
her
skirt
and
confined
the
little
pink
calico
sack
from
out
a
voluminous
with
long
cape
shone
the
chubby
face
of
my
little
friend
for
all
she
was
so
young
and
charmingly
small
clarissa
was
woman
rather
than
child
she
took
entire
care
of
herself
and
prowled
about
in
a
way
making
studies
and
observations
with
ludicrous
gravity
early
mornings
she
came
with
slow
matronly
gait
down
to
the
and
rolling
up
her
sleeves
laid
aside
the
huge
washed
her
face
and
hands
wiping
them
on
her
petticoat
and
arranged
her
jetty
indian
hair
with
the
quiet
unconsciousness
of
fifty
years
her
nod
with
the
reserved
yet
affectionate
smile
put
me
in
happiness
for
the
day
and
when
as
i
strolled
about
she
overtook
me
and
placed
her
little
hand
in
mine
looking
up
with
fearless
quiet
confidence
i
measured
step
with
her
and
we
held
sweet
chats
about
squirrels
and
but
i
thought
her
most
charming
when
she
brought
her
father
down
to
our
after
supper
and
alternately
on
his
knee
or
mine
listened
to
our
stories
and
wound
a
soft
little
arm
about
our
necks
the
twilight
passed
agreeably
thus
clarissa
gradually
paying
less
and
less
attention
to
our
yarns
till
she
pulled
the
skirts
of
my
cavalry
coat
over
her
and
curling
up
on
my
lap
laid
her
dear
little
head
on
my
breast
smiled
gaped
rubbed
with
plump
knuckles
the
blinking
eyes
dozed
and
at
last
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
i
can
even
now
see
old
protem
draw
an
explanatory
map
on
the
ground
his
moccasin
had
smoothed
and
go
on
with
his
story
of
bear
fight
or
wolf
trap
illustrating
by
singularly
apt
gesture
every
trait
and
motion
of
the
animal
he
described
while
firelight
warmed
the
brown
skin
and
ruddy
cheek
of
my
little
charge
and
flickered
on
her
soft
black
hair
the
last
bear
story
of
an
evening
being
ended
protem
took
from
me
clarissa
whose
single
yawn
and
pretty
bewilderment
subsided
in
a
second
leaving
her
sound
asleep
on
the
buckskin
shoulder
of
her
father
about
half
way
between
sheep
rock
and
the
extensive
eruptions
of
basalt
have
occurred
deluging
the
lower
slopes
and
flowing
in
gently
inclined
fields
and
streams
down
through
shasta
valley
for
many
miles
the
surface
of
this
basalt
country
is
singularly
diversified
rising
above
its
general
level
are
numerous
domes
some
of
them
smoothly
arched
over
with
rock
others
perforated
at
the
top
and
more
broken
in
circular
parapets
the
origin
of
these
singular
blisters
is
probably
simple
overflowing
former
trachyte
fields
the
basalt
swept
down
covering
a
series
of
pools
and
brooks
the
water
converted
into
steam
blew
up
the
viscous
rock
in
such
forms
as
we
find
here
and
there
the
basalt
surface
opens
in
circular
orifices
into
which
you
may
look
a
hundred
feet
or
more
in
in
company
with
professor
brewer
i
visited
this
very
region
and
we
were
then
shown
an
interesting
tubular
cavern
lying
directly
under
the
surface
of
a
lava
plain
palmer
and
i
revisited
the
spot
and
having
tied
our
mules
descended
through
a
circular
hole
to
the
cavern
s
mouth
an
archway
of
black
lava
sixty
feet
wide
by
eighty
high
with
a
floor
of
lava
sand
and
rough
bowlders
led
under
the
basalt
in
a
northerly
direction
preserving
an
incline
not
more
than
the
gentle
slope
of
the
country
our
roof
overhead
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
feet
thick
we
followed
the
cavern
which
was
a
comparatively
regular
tube
for
half
or
of
a
mile
now
and
then
the
roof
would
open
up
in
larger
chambers
and
the
floor
be
cumbered
with
huge
piles
of
lava
over
which
we
scrambled
sometimes
nearly
reaching
the
ceiling
fresh
and
smooth
lined
the
sides
innumerable
bats
and
owls
on
silent
wing
floated
by
our
candles
fanning
an
air
singularly
still
and
dense
after
a
cautious
scramble
over
a
long
pile
of
immense
basalt
blocks
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
cave
and
sat
down
upon
piles
of
we
then
repeated
an
experiment
formerly
made
by
brewer
and
myself
of
blowing
out
our
candle
to
observe
the
intense
darkness
then
firing
a
pistol
that
we
might
hear
its
dull
muffled
explosion
the
formation
of
this
cave
as
explained
in
professor
whitney
s
geological
report
is
this
a
basalt
stream
flowing
down
from
shasta
cooled
and
hardened
upon
the
surface
while
within
the
mass
remained
molten
and
fluid
from
simple
pressure
the
lava
burst
out
at
the
lower
end
and
flowing
forth
left
an
empty
tube
wonderfully
fresh
and
recent
the
whole
confused
appeared
and
we
felt
as
we
walked
and
climbed
back
to
the
opening
and
to
daylight
as
if
we
had
been
allowed
to
travel
back
into
the
volcano
one
more
view
of
shasta
obtained
a
few
days
later
from
well
s
ranch
on
the
yreka
road
seems
worthy
of
mention
from
here
the
cone
and
side
crater
are
in
line
making
a
single
symmetrical
form
with
broad
broken
summit
singularly
like
cotopaxi
you
look
over
green
meadows
and
cultivated
fields
beyond
is
a
chain
of
little
volcanoes
girdling
shasta
s
foot
for
the
most
part
bare
and
yellow
but
clouded
in
places
with
dark
forest
which
a
little
farther
up
mantles
the
broad
grand
cone
and
sweeps
up
over
ridge
and
cañon
to
alpine
heights
of
rock
and
ice
strange
and
splendid
is
the
evening
effect
from
here
when
shadow
over
base
and
light
upon
summit
divide
the
vast
pile
into
two
zones
of
and
we
watched
the
colors
fade
and
the
peak
recede
farther
and
dimmer
among
darkness
and
stars
xiii
mount
whitney
there
lay
between
carson
and
mount
whitney
a
ride
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
miles
along
the
east
base
of
the
sierra
like
other
exact
professions
gathers
among
its
followers
certain
types
of
men
and
manners
either
by
some
mode
of
natural
selection
or
else
after
a
darwinian
way
developing
one
set
of
traits
to
the
exclusion
of
others
however
interesting
it
might
be
to
investigate
the
moulding
power
of
whip
and
reins
or
to
discover
what
measure
of
coachman
there
is
latent
in
every
one
of
us
it
can
not
be
questioned
that
the
characters
of
drivers
do
resemble
one
another
in
surprising
degree
that
ostentatious
silence
and
way
of
ignoring
one
s
presence
on
the
box
for
the
first
half
hour
the
undertone
in
which
they
remonstrate
with
the
swing
team
and
such
single
refrain
of
obsolete
song
as
they
drone
and
drone
a
hundred
times
may
be
observed
on
every
coach
from
san
diego
to
montana
so
i
found
it
natural
enough
that
the
driver
my
sole
companion
from
carson
to
aurora
should
sit
for
the
first
hour
in
a
silence
etiquette
forbade
me
to
violate
his
team
by
strict
attention
to
their
duties
must
have
left
his
mind
quite
free
and
i
saw
symptoms
of
suppressed
sociability
within
forty
minutes
of
our
departure
the
house
if
my
memory
serves
was
his
landmark
for
taciturnity
for
soon
after
passing
it
he
began
to
skirmish
along
a
sort
of
picket
line
of
conversation
to
the
wheel
mares
he
remarked
hot
gals
ain
t
it
tho
and
to
his
off
leader
who
strained
wild
eyes
in
every
direction
for
something
to
become
excited
about
look
at
him
dixie
wouldn
t
you
like
a
rabbit
to
shy
at
with
a
true
driver
s
pride
in
reading
men
he
scanned
me
from
boots
to
barometer
and
at
last
to
my
immense
delight
said
with
the
air
of
throwing
his
hat
into
a
ring
what
mountain
was
you
going
down
to
measure
had
he
inquired
after
my
grandfather
by
his
first
name
i
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
at
once
i
told
him
the
plain
truth
and
waited
for
further
developments
but
like
an
indifferent
shot
who
drives
centre
on
a
first
trial
he
proposed
not
to
endanger
his
reputation
for
infallibility
by
other
ventures
and
withdrew
again
to
that
conspicuous
stupidity
which
coachmen
and
buddhists
alike
delight
in
left
to
myself
i
spent
hours
in
looking
out
over
the
desert
and
up
along
that
bold
front
of
sierra
which
rose
on
our
right
from
the
sage
plains
of
carson
valley
up
through
ramparts
of
pine
land
to
summits
of
rock
and
ravines
with
sunken
so
far
as
aurora
i
remember
little
worth
describing
sierras
or
outlying
volcanic
bound
the
west
about
our
road
are
desert
plains
and
rolling
hills
fresh
light
olive
at
this
june
season
and
softly
sloping
in
long
down
to
wide
impressive
levels
green
valleys
and
cultivated
farms
margin
the
carson
and
walker
rivers
sierras
are
not
lofty
enough
to
be
grand
desert
too
gentle
and
overspread
with
sage
to
be
terrible
yet
the
pale
high
key
of
all
its
colors
and
singular
aërial
brilliancy
lend
an
otherwise
dreary
enough
picture
the
charm
as
i
once
before
said
of
drawings
there
is
no
perspective
under
this
fierce
white
light
in
midday
intensely
sharp
reflections
glare
from
hill
and
valley
except
where
the
shadow
of
passing
cloud
spreads
cool
and
blue
over
olive
slopes
alas
for
aurora
once
so
active
and
bustling
with
silver
mines
and
its
almost
daily
murder
whiskey
hells
and
two
vigilance
committees
graced
those
days
of
prosperity
and
mirthful
gallows
of
and
the
gay
delirium
of
speculation
now
her
sad
streets
are
lined
with
closed
doors
a
painful
silence
broods
over
quartz
mills
and
through
the
whole
deserted
town
one
perceives
that
melancholy
security
of
human
life
which
is
hereabouts
one
of
the
pathetic
symptoms
of
bankruptcy
the
boys
have
gone
off
to
merrily
shoot
one
another
somewhere
else
leaving
poor
aurora
in
the
hands
of
a
sort
of
coroner
s
jury
who
gather
nightly
at
the
one
saloon
and
hold
dreary
inquests
over
departed
enterprise
my
landlord
s
tread
echoed
through
a
large
empty
hotel
and
when
i
responded
to
his
call
for
lunch
the
silentest
of
girls
became
medium
between
me
and
a
chinaman
who
gazed
through
his
kitchen
door
as
in
pity
for
one
who
must
choose
between
starving
and
his
own
cookery
but
i
have
always
felt
it
unpardonable
egotism
for
a
traveller
to
force
the
reader
into
sharing
with
him
the
inevitable
miseries
of
roadside
food
whatever
merit
there
may
be
in
locking
this
prandial
grief
fast
from
public
view
i
feel
myself
entitled
to
in
a
high
degree
for
i
hold
it
in
my
power
to
describe
the
most
revolting
cuisine
on
the
planet
yet
refrain
from
aurora
my
road
still
parallel
with
the
mountains
though
now
hidden
from
them
by
banks
of
volcanic
hills
climbed
a
long
wearisome
slope
from
whose
summit
a
glorious
panorama
of
snowy
sierras
lay
before
us
from
our
feet
steep
declivities
fell
two
thousand
feet
to
the
level
of
a
wide
desert
basin
bounded
upon
the
west
by
long
ranks
of
high
white
peaks
and
otherwise
walled
in
by
chains
of
volcanic
hills
smooth
with
dull
sage
flanks
and
yet
varied
here
and
there
by
outcropping
formations
of
eruptive
rocks
and
dusky
cedar
forests
just
at
the
sierra
foot
surrounded
by
bare
gray
volcanoes
and
reaches
of
ashen
plain
lies
mono
lake
a
broad
oval
darkened
along
its
farther
shore
by
reflecting
the
shadowed
mountains
and
pale
tranquil
blue
where
among
light
desert
levels
it
mirrors
the
silken
softness
of
sky
and
cloud
flocks
of
pelicans
high
against
the
sky
floated
in
slow
wheeling
flight
reflecting
the
sun
from
white
wings
and
turning
were
lost
in
the
blue
to
gleam
out
again
like
flakes
of
snow
the
eye
ranges
over
strange
forbidding
and
leagues
of
desert
from
which
no
familiarity
can
ever
banish
suggestions
of
death

along

of

recognized
the
old
familiar
summits
mount

lyell

and
that
firm
peak
with
titan
strength
and

so
square
and
solid
it
seems
altogether
natural
we
should
have
named
it
for
california
s
statesman
john
conness
we
rumbled
down
hill
and
out
upon
the
desert
plodding
until
evening
through
sand
and
over
rocky
spurs
at
last
crossing
adobe
meadows
where
were
settlements
and
a
herd
of
spanish
cattle
which
had
escaped
the
drought
of
california
and
now
marched
northward
bound
for
montana
frowning
volcanic
hills
flanked
our
road
as
evening
wore
on
lifting
dark
forms
against
a
sky
singularly
pale
and
luminous
afar
we
caught
glimpses
of
the
dark
swelling
sierra
wave
thrusting
up
peaks
and
then
descending
into
hollows
among
lava
mounds
found
ourselves
shut
completely
in
a
night
at
the
hot
springs
of
partzwick
was
notably
free
from
anything
which
may
be
recounted
morning
found
me
waiting
alone
on
the
hotel
veranda
and
i
suppose
the
luxuries
of
the
establishment
must
have
left
a
stamp
of
melancholy
upon
my
face
for
the
little
solemn
driver
who
drew
up
his
vehicle
at
the
door
said
in
a
tone
of
condolence
the
hearse
is
stages
drivers
and
teams
had
been
successively
worse
as
i
journeyed
southward
this
little
old
specimen
by
whose
side
i
sat
from
partzwick
to
independence
ought
to
be
excepted
and
i
should
neglect
a
duty
were
i
not
to
portray
one
at
least
of
his
traits
he
was
a
musical
old
fellow
and
given
to
chanting
in
low
tones
songs
sometimes
pathetic
often
sentimental
but
in
every
case
preserved
by
him
in
most
fragmentary
recollection
such
singing
suffered
too
from
the
necessary
and
frequent
interruption
of
driving
the
same
breath
quavering
in
cracked
melody
and
tossing
some
neatly
rounded
oath
or
at
off
or
near
wheeler
catching
up
an
end
of
the
refrain
again
in
time
to
satisfy
his
musical
requirements
all
the
morning
he
had
warned
me
most
impressively
to
count
myself
favored
if
a
certain
bridge
over
bishop
s
creek
should
not
sink
under
us
and
cast
me
upon
wild
waters
rightly
estimating
my
friend
i
was
not
surprised
when
we
reached
the
spot
to
find
a
good
solid
structure
bridging
a
narrow
creek
not
more
than
four
feet
deep
as
we
rolled
on
down
owen
s
valley
he
sang
chatted
and
drove
in
a
manner
which
showed
him
capable
of
three
distinct
yet
simultaneous
mental
processes
i
follow
his
words
as
nearly
as
memory
serves
that
creek
sir
was
six
feet
deep
oh
lillie
sweet
lillie
dear
lillie
what
the
devil
are
you
shying
at
you
cursed
mustang
come
up
out
of
that
little
green
yes
seven
feet
and
if
we
d
have
fell
in
swimming
wouldn
t
saved
us
you
balley
what
are
you
a
doin
on
neath
the
hill
in
the
flowing
and
what
s
more
we
couldn
t
have
crawled
up
that
bank
nohow
my
own
dear
lillie
you
d
like
to
kick
over
them
traces
would
you
keep
your
doggoned
neck
up
snug
against
that
collar
and
take
that
we
d
drowned
sir
drowned
sure
as
thunder
in
the
place
where
the
violets
desert
hills
and
low
mountain
gateways
opening
views
of
vast
sterile
plains
no
longer
formed
our
eastern
outlook
the
white
mountains
a
lofty
barren
chain
vying
with
the
sierras
in
altitude
rose
in
splendid
rank
and
stretched
southeast
parallel
with
the
great
range
down
the
broad
intermediate
trough
flowed
owen
s
river
alternately
through
expanses
of
natural
meadow
and
desolate
reaches
of
sage
the
sierra
as
we
travelled
southward
became
bolder
and
bolder
strong
granite
spurs
plunging
steeply
down
into
the
desert
above
the
mountain
sculpture
grew
grander
and
grander
until
forms
wild
and
rugged
as
the
alps
stretched
on
in
dense
ranks
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
more
and
more
the
granite
came
out
in
all
its
strength
less
and
less
soil
covered
the
slopes
groves
of
pine
became
rarer
and
sharp
rugged
buttresses
advanced
boldly
to
the
plain
here
and
there
a
between
rough
granite
pyramids
and
flanked
by
huge
moraines
opened
its
savage
gallery
back
among
peaks
even
around
the
summits
there
was
but
little
snow
and
the
streams
which
at
short
intervals
flowed
from
the
mountain
foot
traversing
the
plains
were
sunken
far
below
their
ordinary
volume
the
mountain
forms
and
mode
of
sculpture
of
the
opposite
ranges
are
altogether
different
the
white
and
inyo
chains
formed
chiefly
of
uplifted
sedimentary
beds
are
largely
covered
with
soil
and
wherever
the
solid
rock
is
exposed
its
easily
traced
strata
plains
and
soft
wooded
surface
combined
in
producing
a
general
aspect
of
breadth
and
smoothness
while
the
sierra
here
more
than
anywhere
else
holds
up
a
front
of
solid
stone
carved
into
most
intricate
and
highly
ornamental
forms
vast
aiguilles
trimmed
from
summit
to
base
with
line
of
slender
minarets
huge
broad
domes
deeply
fluted
and
surmounted
with
tall
obelisks
and
everywhere
the
greatest
profusion
of
bristling
points
from
the
base
of
each
range
a
long
sloping
talus
descends
gently
to
the
river
and
here
and
there
bursting
up
through
sierra
rise
the
red
and
black
forms
of
recent
volcanoes
as
regular
and
barren
as
if
cooled
but
yesterday
i
had
reason
for
not
regretting
my
departure
from
the
inyo
house
at
independence
next
morning
before
sunrise
and
when
a
young
woman
in
an
elaborate
brown
calico
copied
evidently
from
some
imperial
evening
toilet
pertly
demanded
my
place
by
the
driver
adding
that
she
was
not
one
of
the
inside
kind
i
willingly
yielded
and
made
myself
contented
on
the
back
seat
alone
presently
however
a
companion
came
to
me
in
the
person
of
a
spanish
doña
clad
altogether
in
black
with
a
shawl
worn
over
her
head
after
the
manner
of
a
mantilla
when
it
began
to
rain
violently
and
beat
upon
that
brown
calico
i
made
bold
to
offer
the
young
woman
my
sheltered
place
but
she
gayly
declined
averring
herself
not
made
of
sugar
so
the
doña
and
i
shared
my
great
coat
across
our
laps
and
established
relations
of
civility
though
she
spoke
no
english
and
i
only
that
little
spanish
so
much
more
embarrassing
than
none
in
her
smile
in
the
large
soft
eyes
and
that
tinge
of
castilian
blood
which
shone
through
olive
cheek
i
saw
the
signs
of
a
race
blessed
with
sturdier
health
than
ours
with
snowy
hair
growing
low
on
a
massive
forehead
and
just
a
glimpse
now
and
then
of
large
gold
beads
through
a
white
handkerchief
about
her
throat
she
seemed
to
me
a
charming
picture
though
perhaps
her
fine
looks
gained
something
by
contrasting
with
the
sickly
girl
in
front
whose
pallor
and
cough
could
not
have
meant
less
than
the
pretubercular
state
clouds
covered
the
mountains
on
either
hand
leaving
me
only
ranches
and
people
to
observe
may
i
be
forgiven
if
i
am
wrong
in
accounting
for
the
late
improvement
of
political
tone
in
tuolumne
by
the
presence
here
of
so
large
a
share
of
her
most
degraded
citizens
people
whose
faces
and
dress
and
life
and
manners
are
sadder
than
any
possibilities
held
up
to
us
by
darwin
my
long
ride
ended
in
a
few
hours
at
lone
pine
where
from
the
hotel
window
i
watched
a
mass
of
storm
which
covered
and
veiled
the
region
where
i
knew
my
goal
the
whitney
summit
must
stand
for
two
days
hung
low
about
the
sierra
base
their
vapor
banks
dark
with
fringes
of
shower
at
times
drifting
out
over
lone
pine
and
quenching
a
thirsty
earth
on
the
third
afternoon
blue
sky
shone
through
rifts
overhead
and
now
and
then
a
single
peak
dashed
with
broken
sunshine
rose
for
a
moment
over
rolling
clouds
which
swelled
above
it
again
like
huge
billows
about
an
hour
before
sunset
the
storm
began
rapidly
to
sink
into
level
fold
over
which
in
clear
yellow
light
emerged
peaks
the
liberated
sun
poured
down
shafts
of
light
piercing
the
mist
which
now
in
locks
of
gold
and
gray
blew
about
the
mountain
heads
in
wonderful
splendor
how
deep
and
solemn
a
blue
filled
the
cañon
depths
what
passion
of
light
glowed
around
the
summits
with
delight
i
watched
them
one
after
another
fading
till
only
the
sharp
terrible
crest
of
whitney
still
red
with
reflected
light
from
the
sun
showed
bright
and
glorious
above
the
whole
sierra
upon
observing
the
topography
i
saw
that
one
bold
spur
advanced
from
mount
whitney
to
the
plain
on
either
side
of
it
profound
cañons
opened
back
to
the
summit
i
remembered
the
impossibility
of
making
a
climb
up
those
northern
precipices
and
at
once
chose
the
more
southern
gorge
next
morning
we
set
out
on
horseback
for
the
mountain
base
twelve
miles
across
plains
and
through
an
outlying
range
of
hills
my
companion
for
the
trip
was
paul
pinson
as
tough
and
plucky
a
mountaineer
as
france
ever
sent
us
who
consented
readily
to
follow
me
josé
the
and
grinning
mexican
boy
who
rode
with
us
was
to
remain
in
care
of
our
animals
at
the
while
we
made
the
climb
i
left
a
green
barometer
to
be
observed
at
lone
pine
and
carried
my
short
instrument
by
the
same
excellent
maker
gauzy
mists
again
enveloped
the
sierra
leaving
us
free
minds
to
enjoy
a
ride
of
which
the
very
first
mile
supplied
me
food
for
days
of
thought
the
american
residents
of
lone
pine
outskirts
live
in
a
homeless
fashion
sullen
almost
arrogant
neglect
stares
out
from
the
open
doors
there
is
no
attempt
at
grace
no
memory
of
comfort
no
suggested
hope
for
improvement
not
so
the
spanish
homes
their
low
adobe
cabins
neatly
enclosed
with
even
fence
and
lining
hedge
of
blooming
hollyhock
we
stopped
to
bow
to
my
friend
and
stage
companion
the
doña
she
sat
in
the
threshold
of
her
open
door
sewing
beyond
her
stretched
a
bare
floor
clean
and
white
the
few
chairs
the
table
spread
with
snowy
linen
everything
shone
with
an
air
of
religious
spotlessness
symmetry
reigned
in
the
precise
garden
arranged
in
rows
of
and
crisp
heads
of
vernal
lettuce
i
longed
for
a
painter
to
catch
her
brilliant
smile
and
surround
her
on
canvas
as
she
was
here
with
order
and
dignity
the
same
plain
black
dress
clad
her
ample
figure
and
about
the
neck
heavy
barbaric
gold
beads
served
again
as
collar
under
low
eaves
above
her
and
quite
around
the
house
hung
in
triple
row
festoons
of
flaming
red
peppers
in
delicious
contrast
with
the
rich
adobe
gray
it
was
a
study
of
order
and
true
womanly
repose
fitted
to
cheer
us
and
a
grouping
of
such
splendid
color
as
might
tempt
a
painter
to
cross
the
world
a
little
farther
on
we
passed
an
indian
ranchero
where
several
willow
wickyups
were
built
upon
the
bank
of
a
cold
brook
children
played
about
here
and
there
a
few
old
squaws
bustled
at
household
work
but
nearly
all
lay
outstretched
dozing
a
sort
of
tattered
brilliancy
characterized
the
place
gay
squalor
reigned
there
seemed
hardly
more
lack
of
thrift
or
sense
of
decorum
than
in
the
american
ranches
yet
somehow
the
latter
send
a
stab
of
horror
through
one
while
this
quaint
indolence
and
picturesque
neglect
seem
aptly
contrived
to
set
off
the
indian
genius
for
loafing
and
leave
you
with
a
sort
of
æsthetic
satisfaction
rather
than
the
sorrow
their
half
development
should
properly
evoke
leaving
all
this
behind
us
our
road
led
westward
across
a
long
sage
slope
entering
a
narrow
tortuous
pass
through
a
low
range
of
outlying
granite
hills
strangely
weathered
forms
towered
on
either
side
their
bare
brown
surface
contrasting
pleasantly
with
the
vivid
ribbon
of
willows
which
wove
a
green
and
silver
cover
over
swift
water
the
granite
was
riven
with
innumerable
cracks
showing
here
and
there
a
strong
tendency
to
concentric
forms
and
i
judged
the
immense
spheroidal
bowlders
which
lay
on
all
sides
piled
one
upon
another
to
be
the
kernels
or
nuclei
of
larger
masses
quickly
crossing
this
ridge
we
came
out
upon
the
true
sierra
a
broad
inclined
plain
stretching
north
and
south
as
far
as
we
could
see
directly
in
front
of
us
rose
the
rugged
form
of
mount
whitney
spur
a
single
mass
of
granite
and
darkened
with
coniferous
groves
the
summits
were
lost
in
a
cloud
of
almost
indigo
hue
putting
our
horses
at
a
trot
we
quickly
ascended
the
and
at
the
very
foot
of
the
rocks
dismounted
and
made
up
our
packs
josé
with
the
horses
left
us
and
went
back
half
a
mile
to
a
mountain
ranch
where
he
was
to
await
our
return
and
presently
pinson
and
i
with
heavy
burdens
upon
our
backs
began
slowly
to
work
our
way
up
the
granite
spur
and
toward
the
great
cañon
an
hour
s
climb
brought
us
around
upon
the
south
wall
of
our
spur
and
about
a
thousand
feet
above
a
stream
which
dashed
and
leaped
along
the
cañon
bottom
through
wild
ravines
and
over
granite
bluffs
our
slope
was
a
rugged
giving
foothold
here
and
there
to
pine
and
juniper
trees
but
for
the
greater
part
bare
and
bold
far
above
at
an
elevation
of
ten
thousand
feet
a
dark
grove
of
alpine
pines
gathered
in
the
cañon
bed
thither
we
bent
our
steps
edging
from
cleft
to
cleft
making
constant
though
insignificant
progress
at
length
our
wall
became
so
wild
and
deeply
cut
with
side
cañons
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
follow
it
longer
and
descended
carefully
to
the
bottom
almost
immediately
with
heavy
wind
gusts
and
sound
as
of
torrents
a
storm
broke
upon
us
darkening
the
air
and
drenching
us
to
the
skin
the
three
hours
we
toiled
up
over
rocks
through
dripping
and
among
trains
of
were
not
noticeable
for
their
cheerfulness
the
storm
had
ceased
but
it
was
evening
when
wet
and
exhausted
we
at
length
reached
the
alpine
grove
and
threw
ourselves
down
for
rest
under
a
huge
overhanging
rock
which
offered
its
shelter
for
our
bivouac
logs
soon
brought
in
by
pinson
were
kindled
the
hot
blaze
seemed
pleasant
to
us
though
i
can
not
claim
to
have
enjoyed
those
two
hours
spent
in
turning
round
and
round
before
it
while
steaming
and
drying
but
the
broiled
beef
the
toast
and
those
generous
cups
of
tea
to
which
we
devoted
the
hour
between
ten
and
eleven
were
quite
satisfactory
so
too
was
the
pleasant
chat
till
midnight
warned
us
to
roll
up
in
overcoats
and
close
our
eyes
to
the
fire
to
the
dark
sombre
grove
and
far
stars
crowding
the
now
cloudless
heavens
the
sun
rose
and
shone
on
us
while
we
breakfasted
through
all
the
visible
sky
not
a
cloud
could
be
seen
and
thanks
to
yesterday
s
rain
the
air
was
of
crystal
purity
into
it
the
granite
summits
above
us
projected
forms
of
sunlit
gray
up
the
glacier
valley
above
camp
we
slowly
tramped
through
a
forest
of
noble
pinus
flexilis
the
trunks
of
bright
sienna
contrasting
richly
with
deep
bronze
foliage
minor
flutings
of
a
medial
moraine
offered
gentle
grade
and
agreeable
footing
for
a
mile
and
more
after
which
by
degrees
the
woods
gave
way
to
a
wide
open
amphitheatre
surrounded
with
cliffs
i
can
never
enter
one
of
these
great
hollow
mountain
chambers
without
a
pause
there
is
a
grandeur
and
spaciousness
which
expand
and
fit
the
mind
for
yet
larger
sensations
when
you
shall
stand
on
the
height
above
velvet
of
alpine
sward
edging
an
icy
brooklet
by
whose
margin
we
sat
down
reached
to
the
right
and
left
far
enough
to
spread
a
narrow
foreground
over
which
we
saw
a
chain
of
peaks
swelling
from
either
side
toward
our
amphitheatre
s
head
where
springing
splendidly
over
them
all
stood
the
sharp
form
of
whitney
precipices
white
with
light
and
of
incandescent
brilliance
grouped
themselves
along
walls
and
slopes
all
around
us
in
wild
huge
heaps
lay
wrecks
of
glacier
and
avalanche
we
started
again
passing
the
last
tree
and
began
to
climb
painfully
up
loose
and
lodged
blocks
of
the
north
wall
from
here
to
the
very
foot
of
that
granite
pyramid
which
crowns
the
mountain
we
found
neither
difficulty
nor
danger
only
a
long
tedious
climb
over
footing
which
from
time
to
time
gave
way
provokingly
by
this
time
mist
floated
around
the
brow
of
mount
whitney
forming
a
gray
helmet
from
which
now
and
then
the
wind
blew
out
long
waving
plumes
after
a
brief
rest
we
began
to
scale
the
southeast
ridge
climbing
from
rock
to
rock
and
making
our
way
up
steep
fields
of
soft
snow
precipices
sharp
and
severe
fell
away
to
east
and
west
of
us
but
the
rough
pile
above
still
afforded
a
way
we
had
to
use
extreme
caution
for
many
blocks
hung
ready
to
fall
at
a
touch
and
the
snow
where
we
were
forced
to
work
up
it
often
gave
way
threatening
to
hurl
us
down
into
cavernous
hollows
when
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
top
i
suddenly
fell
through
but
supporting
myself
by
my
arms
looked
down
into
a
grotto
of
rock
and
ice
and
out
through
a
sort
of
window
over
the
western
bluffs
and
down
thousands
of
feet
to
the
valley
of
the
kern
i
carefully
and
slowly
worked
my
body
out
and
crept
on
hands
and
knees
up
over
steep
and
treacherous
where
a
slide
would
have
swept
me
over
a
brink
of
the
southern
precipice
we
kept
to
the
granite
as
much
as
possible
pinson
taking
one
train
of
blocks
and
i
another
above
us
but
thirty
feet
rose
a
crest
beyond
which
we
saw
nothing
i
dared
not
think
it
the
summit
till
we
stood
there
and
mount
whitney
was
under
our
feet
close
beside
us
a
small
mound
of
rock
was
piled
upon
the
peak
and
solidly
built
into
it
an
indian
pointing
due
west
i
climbed
out
to
the
southwest
brink
and
looking
down
could
see
that
fatal
precipice
which
had
prevented
me
seven
years
before
i
strained
my
eyes
beyond
but
already
dense
impenetrable
clouds
had
closed
us
in
on
the
whole
this
climb
was
far
less
dangerous
than
i
had
reason
to
hope
only
at
the
very
crest
where
ice
and
rock
are
thrown
together
insecurely
did
we
encounter
any
very
trying
work
the
utter
unreliableness
of
that
honeycomb
and
cavernous
cliff
was
rather
uncomfortable
and
might
at
any
moment
give
the
deathfall
to
one
who
had
not
coolness
and
muscular
power
at
instant
command
i
hung
my
barometer
from
the
mound
of
our
indian
predecessor
nor
did
i
grudge
his
hunter
pride
the
honor
of
first
finding
that
one
pathway
to
the
summit
of
the
united
states
fifteen
thousand
feet
above
two
oceans
while
we
lunched
i
engraved
pinson
s
and
my
name
upon
a
half
dollar
and
placed
it
in
a
hollow
of
the
crest
clouds
still
hung
motionless
over
us
but
in
half
an
hour
a
west
wind
drew
across
drifting
the
heavy
vapors
along
with
it
light
poured
in
reddening
the
clouds
which
soon
rolled
away
opening
a
grand
view
of
the
western
sierra
ridge
and
of
the
whole
system
of
the
kern
only
here
and
there
could
blue
sky
be
seen
but
fortunately
the
sun
streamed
through
one
of
these
windows
in
the
storm
lighting
up
splendidly
the
snowy
rank
from
kaweah
to
mount
brewer
there
they
rose
as
of
old
firm
and
solid
even
the
great
though
somewhat
shrunken
lay
as
they
had
seven
years
before
i
saw
the
peaks
and
passes
and
amphitheatres
dear
old
cotter
and
i
had
climbed
even
that
mount
brewer
pass
where
we
looked
back
over
the
pathway
of
our
dangers
and
up
with
regretful
hearts
to
the
very
rock
on
which
i
sat
deep
below
flowed
the
kern
its
hundred
branches
gleaming
out
amid
rock
and
ice
or
traced
far
away
in
the
great
glacier
trough
by
dark
lines
of
pine
there
only
twelve
miles
northwest
stretched
that
ragged
divide
where
cotter
and
i
came
down
the
precipice
with
our
rope
beyond
into
the
vague
blue
of
king
s
cañon
sloped
the
ice
and
rock
of
mount
brewer
wall
sombre
and
their
even
gloomier
shadows
darkened
the
northern
sea
of
peaks
only
a
few
slant
bars
of
sudden
light
flashed
in
upon
purple
granite
and
fields
of
ice
the
rocky
tower
of
mount
tyndall
thrust
up
through
rolling
billows
caught
for
a
moment
the
full
light
and
then
sank
into
darkness
and
mist
when
all
else
was
buried
in
cloud
we
watched
the
great
west
range
weird
and
strange
it
seemed
shaded
by
some
dark
eclipse
here
and
there
through
its
gaps
and
passes
streams
of
mist
floated
in
and
crept
slowly
down
the
cañons
of
the
hither
slope
then
all
along
the
crest
torn
and
rushing
spray
of
clouds
whirled
about
the
peaks
and
in
a
moment
a
vast
gray
wave
reared
high
and
broke
overwhelming
all
just
for
a
moment
every
trace
of
vapor
cleared
away
from
the
east
unveiling
for
the
first
time
spurs
and
gorges
and
plains
i
crept
to
a
brink
and
looked
down
into
the
whitney
cañon
which
was
crowded
with
light
great
scarred
and
precipices
reached
down
four
thousand
feet
curving
together
like
a
ship
and
holding
in
their
granite
bed
a
thread
of
brook
the
small
sapphire
gems
of
alpine
lake
bronze
dots
of
pine
and
here
and
there
a
fine
enamelling
of
snow
beyond
and
below
lay
owen
s
valley
walled
in
by
the
barren
inyo
chain
and
afar
under
a
pale
sad
sky
lengthened
leagues
and
leagues
of
lifeless
desert
the
storm
had
even
swept
across
kern
cañon
and
dashed
high
against
the
peaks
north
and
south
of
us
a
few
sharp
needles
and
spikes
struggled
above
it
for
a
moment
but
it
rolled
over
them
and
rushed
in
torrents
down
the
desert
slope
burying
everything
in
a
dark
swift
cloud
we
hastened
to
pack
up
our
barometer
and
descend
a
little
way
down
the
ice
crust
gave
way
under
pinson
but
he
saved
himself
and
we
hurried
on
reaching
safely
the
leaving
all
dangerous
ground
above
us
so
dense
was
the
cloud
we
could
not
see
a
hundred
feet
but
tramped
gayly
down
over
rocks
and
sand
feeling
quite
assured
of
our
direction
until
suddenly
we
came
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
and
strained
our
eyes
off
into
the
mist
i
threw
a
stone
over
and
listened
in
vain
for
the
sound
of
its
fall
pinson
and
i
both
thought
we
had
deviated
too
far
to
the
north
and
were
on
the
brink
of
whitney
cañon
so
we
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
thinking
to
cross
the
ridge
entering
our
old
amphitheatre
but
in
a
few
moments
we
again
found
ourselves
upon
the
verge
this
time
a
stone
we
threw
over
answered
with
a
faint
dull
crash
from
five
hundred
feet
below
we
were
evidently
upon
a
narrow
blade
i
remembered
no
such
place
and
sat
down
to
recall
carefully
every
detail
of
topography
at
last
i
concluded
that
we
had
either
strayed
down
upon
the
kern
side
or
were
on
one
of
the
cliffs
overhanging
the
head
of
our
true
amphitheatre
feeling
the
necessity
of
keeping
cool
i
determined
to
ascend
to
the
foot
of
the
snow
and
search
for
our
tracks
so
we
slowly
climbed
there
again
and
took
a
new
start
by
this
time
the
wind
howled
fiercely
bearing
a
chill
from
and
sleet
we
hurried
on
before
it
and
after
one
or
two
vain
attempts
succeeded
in
finding
our
old
trail
down
the
amphitheatre
slope
descending
very
rapidly
to
its
floor
from
here
an
exhausting
tramp
of
five
hours
through
the
pine
forest
to
our
camp
and
on
down
the
rough
wearying
slopes
of
the
lower
cañon
brought
us
to
the
plain
where
josé
and
the
horses
awaited
us
from
lone
pine
that
evening
and
from
the
open
carriage
in
which
i
rode
northward
to
independence
i
constantly
looked
back
and
up
into
the
storm
hoping
to
catch
one
more
glimpse
of
mount
whitney
but
all
the
range
lay
submerged
in
dark
rolling
cloud
from
which
now
and
then
a
sullen
mutter
of
thunder
reverberated
for
years
our
chief
professor
whitney
has
made
brave
campaigns
into
the
unknown
realm
of
nature
against
low
prejudice
and
dull
indifference
he
has
led
the
survey
of
california
onward
to
success
there
stand
for
him
two
monuments
one
a
great
report
made
by
his
own
hand
another
the
loftiest
peak
in
the
union
begun
for
him
in
the
planet
s
youth
and
sculptured
of
enduring
granite
by
the
slow
hand
of
time
the
preceding
pages
were
written
immediately
after
my
return
from
mount
whitney
and
without
a
shadow
of
suspicion
that
among
the
sea
of
peaks
half
seen
half
i
could
have
missed
the
true
summit
professor
whitney
alone
possessed
sufficiently
studied
data
to
apply
the
annual
corrections
for
barometric
oscillation
in
the
high
sierra
and
to
his
office
i
at
once
forwarded
my
observations
noted
upon
the
mount
whitney
summit
together
with
the
record
of
simultaneous
readings
at
lone
pine
the
station
upon
which
i
relied
for
a
base
as
i
was
about
mailing
the
chapter
to
our
printer
from
my
camp
in
the
rocky
mountains
i
received
from
professor
pettee
who
had
kindly
made
a
computation
the
puzzling
despatch
that
mount
whitney
only
reached
fourteen
thousand
six
hundred
and
ten
feet
in
altitude
realizing
at
once
that
this
must
be
an
error
i
attributed
it
to
some
great
abnormal
oscillation
of
pressure
due
to
storm
and
decided
not
to
publish
the
measurement
then
for
a
moment
a
sense
of
doubt
came
over
me
lest
i
had
been
mistaken
but
on
carefully
studying
the
map
it
was
reassuring
to
establish
beyond
doubt
the
identity
of
the
peak
designated
on
the
map
of
the
geological
survey
of
california
as
mount
whitney
with
the
one
i
had
climbed
the
reader
will
perhaps
appreciate
then
my
surprise
and
disappointment
when
travelling
in
the
overland
car
to
california
in
september
i
read
and
a
communication
by
goodyear
former
assistant
of
the
geological
survey
made
to
the
california
academy
of
sciences
in
which
he
points
out
with
great
clearness
that
i
had
missed
the
real
peak
to
explain
most
simply
why
goodyear
saw
the
true
mount
whitney
when
he
reached
the
summit
of
my
peak
of
it
is
only
necessary
to
state
that
he
had
a
clear
day
and
the
evident
fact
stared
him
in
the
face
if
the
reader
kindly
refers
to
the
preceding
part
of
the
chapter
descriptive
of
my
climb
he
will
note
that
my
visit
was
unfortunately
during
a
great
storm
through
whose
billows
of
cloud
and
eddying
mists
the
landscape
disclosed
itself
in
fragmentary
glimpses
to
repeat
the
expression
of
my
notebook
as
through
windows
in
the
my
little
granite
island
was
incessantly
beaten
by
breakers
of
vague
impenetrable
cloud
and
never
once
did
the
true
mount
whitney
unveil
its
crest
to
my
eager
eyes
only
one
glimpse
and
i
should
have
bent
my
steps
northward
restless
till
the
peak
was
climbed
but
then
that
would
have
left
nothing
for
goodyear
whose
paper
shows
such
evident
relish
in
my
mistake
that
i
accept
my
as
providential
one
has
in
this
dark
world
so
few
chances
of
conferring
innocent
pure
delight
it
must
always
remain
a
bond
between
goodyear
and
myself
that
in
the
only
paper
he
has
written
on
the
high
sierras
it
was
his
happy
thought
to
point
both
pleasantry
and
argument
with
that
most
grotesque
and
sober
of
beasts
the
mule
and
while
my
regard
for
all
mules
rises
wellnigh
into
the
realm
of
sentiment
i
cherish
no
less
a
feeling
than
profound
indebtedness
toward
the
particular
one
who
succeeded
with
how
great
effort
only
a
can
know
in
getting
goodyear
on
the
now
nameless
peak
whence
like
moses
from
pisgah
he
beheld
the
promised
land
my
gratitude
is
not
all
directed
to
the
mule
either
from
that
just
channel
a
stream
is
directed
toward
the
clear
good
judgment
of
my
friend
who
resolutely
turned
his
back
on
the
alluring
summit
and
promptly
quitted
the
head
of
mule
navigation
to
descend
and
hold
me
up
in
my
proper
light
pleasantry
aside
and
method
being
largely
a
matter
of
taste
goodyear
deserves
credit
for
having
so
clearly
pointed
out
my
mistake
credit
which
i
desire
to
bear
honest
tribute
to
since
his
discovery
has
already
led
several
of
us
to
climb
the
true
peak
a
labor
requiring
little
effort
and
rewarded
by
the
most
striking
view
in
the
sierra
nevada
of
course
i
lost
no
time
in
directing
my
steps
toward
mount
whitney
animated
with
a
lively
delight
which
was
quite
unclouded
by
the
fact
that
two
parties
who
had
three
thousand
miles
the
start
of
me
were
already
and
certain
to
reach
the
goal
before
me
perhaps
there
is
no
element
in
the
varied
life
of
an
explorer
so
full
of
contemplative
pleasure
as
the
frequent
and
rapid
passages
he
makes
between
city
life
and
home
by
that
i
mean
his
true
home
where
the
flames
of
his
bivouac
fire
light
up
trunks
of
sheltering
pine
and
make
an
island
of
light
in
the
silent
darkness
of
the
primeval
forest
the
crushing
of
modern
life
and
the
smothering
struggle
of
civilization
are
so
far
off
that
the
wail
of
suffering
comes
not
nor
the
din
and
dust
of
it
all
and
out
of
your
very
memory
for
a
time
alas
only
for
a
time
fade
those
two
indelible
examples
of
the
shallowness
of
society
those
terrible
pictures
of
sorrow
and
wrong
and
that
perennial
artifice
which
wellnigh
always
chokes
with
its
weedy
growth
the
rare
fine
flowers
of
art
all
is
forgotten
those
murky
clouds
which
in
town
life
dispute
the
serenity
of
one
s
spiritual
air
drift
beyond
view
and
over
you
broods
only
the
quiet
sky
of
night
her
white
stars
moving
beyond
fragrant
or
lost
in
the
dim
tangle
of
their
feathery
foliage
such
is
the
mountaineer
s
evening
spent
contemplatively
before
his
fire
the
profound
sense
of
nature
s
tranquillity
filling
his
mind
with
its
repose
till
the
flames
give
way
to
embers
and
guardian
pines
spread
dusky
arms
over
his
sleep
not
less
a
contrast
greets
him
when
from
simple
field
life
the
doors
of
a
city
suddenly
open
and
the
huddled
complexity
of
everything
jostles
him
either
way
and
as
often
as
one
makes
this
transit
between
civilization
and
the
wilds
one
prizes
most
the
pure
simple
strengthening
joy
of
nature
thus
when
from
the
heat
and
pressure
of
town
in
september
i
suddenly
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
sierra
forest
a
cool
mountain
sky
of
holy
blue
and
my
trees
calm
and
vigorous
as
ever
communicated
thrills
of
pleasure
well
worth
my
brief
separation
from
them
day
after
day
through
the
green
forest
i
rode
on
leaving
the
mustang
to
choose
his
own
gait
scarcely
talking
to
my
two
campaign
companions
who
with
the
plodding
followed
noiselessly
behind
it
was
only
when
we
ascended
the
east
wall
of
the
kern
cañon
on
the
hockett
trail
and
reached
the
nebulous
plateau
where
pine
and
granite
and
cloud
form
the
three
elements
of
a
severe
picture
that
i
felt
myself
filled
to
the
brim
with
my
long
draught
of
nature
and
turned
to
my
followers
for
society
i
was
accompanied
by
seaman
and
knowles
two
settlers
of
tule
river
who
had
been
good
enough
to
take
a
thorough
interest
in
my
proposed
trip
one
less
used
than
i
to
the
strong
originality
and
remarkable
histories
of
frontiersmen
might
have
marvelled
at
the
rich
chat
of
these
two
men
for
myself
however
i
long
ago
learned
to
expect
under
the
rough
garb
and
simple
manners
of
western
plainsmen
and
mountaineers
a
wealth
of
experience
with
its
resultant
harvest
of
philosophy
untrammelled
by
the
schools
these
men
strike
out
boldly
and
arrange
the
universe
to
suit
themselves
not
alone
is
this
noticeable
in
matter
of
general
interest
in
the
most
special
subjects
it
will
not
do
to
assume
an
ignorance
at
all
in
keeping
with
the
primitive
cut
of
their
trousers
or
their
idiom
which
show
strong
affinities
with
the
flint
period
as
an
instance
volcanic
action
has
of
late
years
occupied
much
of
my
thoughts
and
so
dry
a
subject
one
would
think
could
not
have
fixed
the
interest
of
many
travellers
judge
of
my
feelings
therefore
on
the
night
we
reached
the
kern
plateau
and
camped
with
a
solitary
shepherd
to
hear
without
giving
direction
to
it
myself
the
conversation
turn
on
volcanoes
and
realized
as
the
group
renewed
our
fire
and
hours
passed
by
that
my
two
companions
had
been
in
iceland
hawaii
java
and
ecuador
and
that
as
for
the
sheep
herder
he
had
rolled
stones
down
nearly
every
prominent
approachable
crater
on
the
planet
i
was
reminded
of
a
certain
vaquero
who
astounded
professor
brewer
by
launching
out
boldly
in
the
latin
names
of
mexican
plants
the
kern
plateau
so
green
and
lovely
on
my
former
visit
in
was
now
a
gray
sea
of
rolling
granite
ridges
darkened
at
intervals
by
forest
but
no
longer
velveted
with
meadows
and
upland
grasses
the
indefatigable
shepherds
have
camped
everywhere
leaving
hardly
a
spear
of
grass
behind
them
to
the
sad
annoyance
of
our
hungry
horses
we
found
this
true
until
we
entered
the
rough
rocky
cañon
which
leads
down
from
the
false
mount
whitney
in
whose
depths
among
glacier
erratics
and
dark
pines
we
selected
a
spot
where
a
vocal
brook
and
patches
of
carex
meadow
seemed
to
welcome
us
during
a
three
days
painful
illness
which
overtook
me
here
i
felt
that
i
should
never
lose
an
opportunity
to
warn
my
against
watermelon
which
after
all
is
only
an
ingenious
contrivance
of
nature
to
converge
the
waves
of
motion
from
the
midsummer
sun
and
by
the
principles
of
force
conservation
transmute
them
into
so
much
potential
colic
across
from
wall
to
wall
of
our
deep
glacier
cañon
the
morning
sky
stretched
pure
and
blue
but
without
a
trace
of
that
infinite
depth
so
dark
and
vacant
so
alluringly
profound
when
the
sun
nears
its
culmination
we
arose
early
and
all
three
were
marching
up
the
gentle
acclivity
of
the
valley
bottom
when
from
among
the
peaks
darkly
profiled
against
the
east
bold
lances
of
light
shot
down
through
gloom
and
shadow
touching
with
sudden
brightness
here
a
clump
of
feathery
fir
there
a
heap
of
glacier
blocks
pencilling
yellow
lines
across
or
alpine
tarn
and
working
out
along
the
whole
rocky
amphitheatre
above
us
those
splendid
contrasts
of
gold
and
blue
which
are
the
delight
of
mountaineers
and
the
despair
of
painters
knowles
with
the
keen
eye
of
an
accomplished
hunter
became
conscious
as
we
marched
along
just
how
lately
a
mountain
sheep
had
crossed
our
way
and
occasionally
the
whispered
sound
of
light
footfalls
along
the
crags
overhead
riveted
his
attention
upon
some
gray
mote
on
the
granite
and
with
the
huntsman
s
habitual
quiet
he
would
only
ejaculate
buck
or
too
thin
for
venison
or
some
similar
phrase
indicating
the
marvellous
acuteness
of
his
senses
among
the
many
serious
losses
man
has
suffered
in
passing
from
a
life
of
nature
to
one
artificial
is
to
be
numbered
the
fatal
blunting
of
all
his
senses
step
after
step
the
cañon
ascended
with
great
vacant
corridors
opening
among
the
rocky
buttresses
on
either
side
till
at
last
there
were
no
more
firs
the
alpine
meadows
became
mere
patches
and
a
chilly
wind
drew
down
from
among
the
here
savage
and
splendid
sunlight
forever
struggle
for
mastery
of
effect
a
cloud
drifts
over
us
and
the
dark
headlands
of
granite
loom
up
with
impending
mightiness
and
seem
to
advance
toward
each
other
from
opposite
ranks
about
their
feet
the
wreck
of
centuries
of
avalanche
and
above
leaden
vapors
hurrying
and
whirling
all
is
dimness
and
gloom
then
overhead
the
clouds
are
furled
away
and
there
is
light
light
joyous
pure
before
whose
intense
searching
vividness
shadows
unfold
and
mystery
vanishes
through
such
alternating
sensations
we
wound
our
way
round
the
margin
of
two
lakes
of
deep
transparent
water
and
up
to
the
very
head
of
our
amphitheatre
reaching
an
elevation
of
about
thirteen
thousand
feet
we
had
thus
far
encountered
very
little
snow
and
absolutely
no
climbing
all
along
it
had
seemed
to
us
that
from
the
we
might
easily
climb
to
the
dividing
summit
of
the
sierras
and
follow
it
along
to
mount
whitney
i
had
taken
pains
to
diverge
from
my
unsuccessful
route
of
which
lay
now
to
the
east
and
separated
from
us
by
a
high
wall
terminating
in
fantastic
spires
upon
mounting
the
we
found
it
impossible
to
reach
the
true
summit
of
the
range
without
first
descending
into
a
deep
cañon
the
ancient
bed
of
a
tributary
glacier
of
the
kern
the
ice
now
replaced
by
imposing
slopes
of
granite
partly
masked
by
snow
and
plunging
down
into
a
lake
of
startling
vitriol
color
we
toiled
cautiously
down
over
insecure
wreck
of
granite
whose
huge
blocks
threatened
constantly
to
topple
us
over
or
to
rush
out
from
under
foot
and
gather
into
an
avalanche
a
draught
from
the
icy
lake
water
a
brief
rest
on
the
sunny
side
of
a
huge
erratic
and
we
began
the
slow
laborious
ascent
of
the
summit
ridge
unfortunately
the
footing
was
bad
being
composed
chiefly
of
granite
gravel
of
every
stone
in
place
and
each
snow
spot
we
took
advantage
making
pauses
for
breath
now
and
then
until
at
last
we
reached
the
crest
here
a
thin
ridge
and
hurriedly
turned
our
eyes
in
the
direction
of
mount
whitney
the
sharp
dominating
blade
of
granite
rising
a
couple
of
miles
northwest
of
us
over
a
group
of
spiry
pinnacles
was
unmistakable
the
same
severe
beautiful
crest
i
had
struggled
for
in
rose
proudly
into
the
blue
and
though
near
seemed
as
inaccessible
as
ever
in
the
opposite
direction
about
three
miles
away
in
clear
uncolored
plainness
stood
the
peak
where
in
i
had
been
led
by
the
map
and
my
error
perpetuated
by
the
clouds
in
full
view
of
both
peaks
it
seemed
strange
i
could
have
mistaken
one
for
the
other
infallibility
in
retrospect
is
one
of
the
easiest
conditions
imaginable
yet
when
the
memory
of
those
seething
comes
back
to
me
when
i
see
again
the
gloom
made
even
wilder
and
darker
by
bolts
of
sunlight
and
illumined
gauzes
of
mist
when
i
realize
that
the
peak
itself
never
shone
forth
i
am
free
to
confess
that
i
should
make
the
mistake
again
in
charging
this
error
upon
the
map
i
do
not
in
any
sense
intend
to
reflect
on
hoffmann
the
accomplished
chief
topographer
of
the
survey
to
whose
skilful
hand
we
owe
the
forthcoming
map
of
central
california
his
location
of
mount
whitney
depended
upon
two
compass
bearings
only
his
own
from
mount
brewer
which
proves
to
have
been
unvitiated
by
local
magnetic
attraction
and
mine
from
mount
tyndall
which
evidently
is
in
error
it
is
most
curious
to
discover
that
my
bearings
made
from
a
station
on
the
northwest
edge
of
mount
tyndall
where
i
placed
myself
to
observe
on
the
peaks
lying
in
that
direction
are
when
corrected
for
variation
true
while
those
taken
from
a
block
on
the
south
edge
of
the
summit
not
sixty
feet
from
the
first
station
are
abnormal
this
reminds
me
of
the
observations
made
by
professor
brewer
during
our
hours
of
rest
on
the
top
of
lassen
s
peak
where
he
found
the
summit
block
a
local
magnet
thus
the
map
location
on
which
hoffmann
relied
and
of
which
in
i
took
copy
to
identify
the
peak
was
vitiated
in
a
way
neither
of
us
could
have
foreseen
and
a
serious
error
might
have
crept
into
current
geography
but
for
the
timely
visit
of
goodyear
hoffmann
stands
clear
of
blame
in
this
matter
upon
my
shoulders
and
those
of
my
the
storm
and
the
local
magnetic
attraction
it
all
rests
we
sat
for
some
time
in
that
silence
which
even
the
rudest
natures
pay
as
an
unconscious
tribute
to
the
august
presence
of
a
great
mountain
and
then
began
again
the
march
toward
mount
whitney
seaman
who
had
started
ill
here
felt
so
painfully
the
effect
of
altitude
that
we
urged
him
to
struggle
no
further
against
dizziness
and
nausea
but
to
return
which
he
did
with
reluctance
we
parted
at
the
very
crown
of
the
ridge
on
the
verge
of
a
gulf
which
plunges
down
from
mount
whitney
to
owen
s
valley
knowles
who
is
a
sort
of
chamois
kept
his
head
splendidly
and
together
we
clambered
round
and
up
to
the
crest
of
a
bold
needle
about
fourteen
thousand
four
hundred
feet
high
from
which
the
discouraging
truth
dawned
upon
us
that
it
was
impossible
to
surmount
the
three
sharp
pinnacles
which
lay
between
us
and
the
delicately
sculptured
crest
beyond
to
the
right
and
below
three
thousand
feet
down
from
our
tower
i
could
trace
the
line
of
my
attempted
climb
of
to
where
it
disappeared
around
a
projecting
buttress
at
the
foot
of
the
great
precipice
which
forms
the
eastern
face
of
mount
whitney
and
the
subordinate
pinnacles
to
the
south
to
the
left
through
crags
and
splintered
monoliths
we
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
deep
glacier
basin
lying
west
of
mount
whitney
enclosing
great
sweeps
of
and
numerous
vivid
blue
tarns
between
the
minarets
we
could
also
see
portions
of
the
southwest
slope
of
mount
whitney
which
was
evidently
a
smooth
accessible
face
and
the
one
of
all
others
to
attempt
but
the
day
was
already
too
far
advanced
to
leave
us
the
remotest
hope
of
even
reaching
the
glacier
basin
west
of
mount
whitney
and
we
decided
to
return
to
camp
before
beginning
our
wearisome
march
i
sketched
the
outline
of
the
mount
whitney
group
which
so
far
as
i
know
differs
from
any
other
cluster
of
peaks
the
sierra
here
is
a
bold
wall
with
an
almost
perpendicular
front
of
about
three
thousand
feet
which
is
crowned
by
sharp
turrets
having
a
tendency
to
lean
out
over
the
eastern
gulf
these
are
properly
the
crests
of
great
buttresses
which
jut
from
the
general
surface
of
the
granite
front
mount
whitney
itself
springs
up
and
out
like
the
prow
of
a
sharp
ocean
steamer
southward
along
the
summit
my
sketch
is
of
a
confused
region
of
granite
obelisks
and
towers
all
remarkable
for
the
deep
shattering
to
which
the
rock
has
been
subjected
it
is
a
region
which
may
even
yet
suffer
considerable
perceptible
change
since
a
single
winter
s
frost
and
snow
must
dislodge
numberless
blocks
from
the
crests
and
flanks
of
the
whole
group
indeed
at
the
time
of
my
visit
notably
the
period
of
least
snow
and
frost
we
often
heard
the
sharp
rattle
of
falling
we
varied
our
course
homeward
by
climbing
along
a
lateral
ridge
whence
we
could
look
into
the
mount
whitney
basin
and
here
we
were
favored
by
a
fine
view
chiefly
pleasing
to
us
because
the
whole
accessible
slope
of
the
peak
came
out
unobscured
by
intervening
ridges
it
was
evident
that
we
must
find
a
mule
pass
through
the
granite
waves
from
our
present
camp
round
into
the
great
glacier
basin
or
else
plan
our
next
attempt
with
provisions
and
blankets
on
our
backs
and
an
uncertain
number
of
days
clambering
over
the
intervening
cañons
to
the
foot
of
our
peak
the
shades
of
twilight
were
darkening
the
amphitheatre
as
we
plodded
homeward
ghostly
cliffs
and
dim
towers
were
hardly
recognizable
as
defined
against
the
evening
sky
in
which
already
a
few
pale
stars
shone
tremulously
i
spare
the
reader
the
days
of
snow
and
sleet
we
spent
under
a
temporary
shelter
constructed
of
blankets
i
pass
over
the
elaborate
system
of
rivulets
which
forever
burrowed
new
channels
and
originated
future
geography
under
our
tent
these
were
quickly
forgotten
the
morning
of
the
as
we
quitted
our
camp
under
the
shadow
of
the
peak
and
marched
southwestward
down
the
valley
of
our
brook
a
fine
series
of
lateral
moraines
flank
this
cañon
on
the
left
moraines
rising
one
above
another
in
defined
terraces
for
the
most
part
composed
of
granite
blocks
but
here
and
there
of
solid
rock
where
the
ridge
throws
out
prominent
spurs
we
ascended
the
north
wall
zigzagging
to
and
fro
among
pines
till
having
climbed
a
thousand
feet
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
plateau
of
granite
sand
among
groves
of
which
seemed
as
to
me
the
sequoias
always
have
the
relics
of
a
past
climatic
condition
the
octogenarians
of
the
forest
through
open
groves
of
these
giant
trees
whose
red
gnarled
trunks
and
dark
green
foliage
stood
out
with
artistic
definition
upon
bare
granite
sand
we
saw
the
deep
cañon
of
the
kern
a
few
miles
to
our
left
and
beyond
it
swelling
in
splendid
rank
against
the
west
my
old
friends
the
kaweah
peaks
their
dark
pyramidal
summits
here
and
there
touched
with
flashing
the
bottom
of
kern
cañon
was
hidden
from
us
its
craggy
edges
broken
and
rounded
by
glacial
action
and
in
part
built
upon
by
the
fragments
of
great
moraines
were
especially
powerful
and
as
a
master
s
sketch
emphasizes
the
leading
lines
so
here
each
sharply
carved
ravine
or
is
given
force
by
lines
of
almost
black
pines
startled
bands
of
deer
looked
timidly
at
us
for
a
moment
and
then
bounded
wildly
away
through
the
woods
all
else
was
silent
and
motionless
at
evening
we
entered
the
cañon
and
threaded
our
way
up
among
moraines
and
forest
close
to
the
foot
of
mount
whitney
the
peak
itself
rising
grandly
across
the
amphitheatre
s
head
every
spire
and
rocky
crevice
brought
sharply
out
in
the
warm
evening
sunlight
with
my
i
could
see
that
it
was
a
simple
brief
walk
of
a
few
hours
to
the
summit
and
all
anxiety
at
rest
i
lay
down
on
my
blankets
to
watch
the
effects
of
light
as
often
as
one
camps
at
twelve
thousand
feet
in
the
sierra
the
charm
of
crystally
pure
air
these
cold
sparkling
tints
of
rock
and
alpine
lake
the
fiery
bronze
of
foliage
and
luminous
though
sky
combine
to
produce
an
intellectual
and
even
a
spiritual
elevation
deep
and
stirring
feelings
come
naturally
the
present
falls
back
into
its
true
relation
one
s
own
wearying
identity
shrinks
from
the
broad
open
foreground
of
the
vision
and
a
calmness
born
of
reverent
reflections
encompasses
the
soul
at
eleven
o
clock
next
morning
knowles
and
i
stood
together
on
the
topmost
rock
of
mount
whitney
we
found
there
a
monument
of
stones
and
records
of
the
two
parties
who
had
preceded
us
the
first
hunter
and
crapo
and
afterward
that
of
rabe
of
the
geological
survey
the
former
were
save
indian
hunters
the
first
so
far
as
we
know
who
achieved
this
dominating
summit
rabe
has
the
honor
of
the
first
measurement
by
barometer
our
three
visits
were
all
within
a
month
the
day
was
cloudless
and
the
sky
milder
than
is
common
over
these
extreme
heights
warmed
to
a
mellow
glow
and
rested
in
softening
beauty
over
minaret
and
dome
air
and
light
seemed
melted
together
even
the
wild
rocks
springing
up
all
about
us
wore
an
aspect
of
aërial
delicacy
around
the
wide
panorama
half
low
desert
half
rugged
granite
mountains
each
detail
was
observable
but
a
uniform
luminous
medium
toned
without
obscuring
the
field
of
vision
that
fearful
sense
of
wreck
and
desolation
of
a
world
crushed
into
fragments
of
the
ice
chisel
which
unseen
has
wrought
this
strange
mountain
sculpture
all
the
sensations
of
power
and
tragedy
i
had
invariably
felt
before
on
high
peaks
were
totally
forgotten
it
was
the
absolute
reverse
of
the
effect
on
mount
tyndall
where
an
unrelenting
clearness
discovered
every
object
in
all
its
power
and
reality
then
we
saw
only
unburied
wreck
of
geologic
struggles
black
with
sudden
shadow
or
white
under
searching
focus
as
if
the
sun
were
a
great
gathering
light
from
all
space
and
hurling
its
fierce
shafts
upon
spire
and
wall
now
it
was
like
an
opal
world
submerged
in
a
sea
of
dreamy
light
down
through
whose
motionless
transparent
depths
i
became
conscious
of
sunken
ranges
great
hollows
of
undiscernible
depth
reefs
of
pearly
granite
as
clear
and
delicate
as
the
coral
banks
in
a
tropical
ocean
it
was
not
like
a
haze
in
the
lower
world
which
veils
away
distance
in
softly
vanishing
perspective
there
was
no
mist
no
vagueness
no
loss
of
form
nor
fading
of
outline
only
a
strange
harmonizing
of
earth
and
air
shadows
were
faint
yet
defined
lights
visible
but
most
exquisitely
modulated
the
hollow
blue
which
over
tyndall
led
the
eye
up
into
vacant
solitudes
was
here
replaced
by
a
sense
of
sheltering
nearness
a
certain
obscurity
in
the
atmosphere
which
seemed
to
filter
the
sunlight
of
all
its
harsher
properties
i
do
not
permit
myself
to
describe
details
for
they
have
left
no
enduring
impression
nor
am
i
insensible
of
how
vain
any
attempt
must
be
to
reproduce
the
harmony
of
such
subtle
aspects
of
nature
aspects
most
rare
and
indescribable
because
producing
their
charm
by
negative
means
i
suppose
such
an
atmospheric
effect
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
a
lower
stratum
of
pure
transparent
air
overlaid
by
an
upper
one
so
charged
with
moisture
or
perhaps
one
of
those
dry
mists
occasionally
seen
in
the
high
sierra
as
to
intercept
the
blue
rays
of
sunlight
and
admit
only
softened
yellow
ones
this
is
the
true
mount
whitney
the
one
we
named
in
and
upon
which
the
name
of
our
chief
is
forever
to
rest
it
stands
not
like
white
shasta
in
a
grandeur
of
solitude
but
about
it
gather
companies
of
crag
and
spire
piercing
the
blue
or
wrapped
in
monkish
raiment
of
snowstorm
and
mist
far
below
laid
out
in
ashen
death
slumbers
the
desert
silence
reigns
on
these
icy
heights
save
when
scream
of
sierra
eagle
or
loud
crescendo
of
avalanche
interrupts
the
frozen
stillness
or
when
in
symphonic
fulness
a
storm
rolls
through
vacant
cañons
with
its
stern
minor
it
is
hard
not
to
invest
these
great
dominating
peaks
with
consciousness
difficult
to
realize
that
sitting
thus
for
ages
in
presence
of
all
nature
can
work
of
and
no
inner
spirit
has
kindled
nor
throb
of
granite
heart
once
responded
no
buddhistic
even
has
brooded
in
eternal
calm
within
these
breasts
of
stone
a
week
after
my
climb
i
lay
on
the
desert
sand
at
the
foot
of
the
inyo
range
and
looked
up
at
mount
whitney
realizing
all
its
grand
individuality
and
saw
the
drifting
clouds
interrupt
a
serenity
by
frown
after
frown
of
moving
shadow
and
i
entered
for
a
moment
deeply
and
intimately
into
that
strange
realm
where
admiration
blends
with
superstition
that
condition
in
which
the
savage
feels
within
him
the
greatness
of
a
natural
object
and
forever
after
endows
it
with
consciousness
and
power
for
a
moment
i
was
back
in
the
aryan
myth
days
when
they
saw
afar
a
snowy
peak
and
called
it
dhavalagiri
white
elephant
and
invested
it
with
mystic
power
these
peculiar
moments
rare
enough
in
the
life
of
a
scientific
man
when
one
trembles
on
the
edge
of
are
of
interest
as
unfolding
the
origin
and
manner
of
savage
beliefs
and
as
awakening
the
unperishing
germ
of
primitive
manhood
which
is
buried
within
us
all
under
so
much
culture
and
science
how
generally
the
has
been
extinguished
in
modern
students
of
mountains
may
be
realized
by
examining
the
tone
of
alpine
literature
which
once
lifted
above
the
fatiguing
repetition
of
gymnastics
is
almost
invariably
scientific
ruskin
alone
among
prose
writers
on
the
alps
the
dim
past
in
over
cloud
and
peak
and
glacier
his
is
the
rigveda
s
idea
of
nature
the
varying
hues
which
mood
and
emotion
forever
pass
before
his
own
mental
vision
mask
with
their
illusive
mystery
the
simple
realities
of
nature
until
mountains
and
their
bold
natural
facts
are
lost
behind
the
cloudy
poetry
of
the
writer
ruskin
helps
us
to
know
himself
not
the
alps
his
mountain
chapters
although
essentially
four
thousand
years
old
are
however
no
more
an
anachronism
than
the
dim
primeval
spark
which
smoulders
in
all
of
us
their
brilliancy
that
spark
fanned
into
flame
to
follow
a
chapter
of
ruskin
by
one
of
tyndall
is
to
bridge
forty
centuries
and
realize
the
full
contrast
of
archaic
and
modern
thought
this
was
the
drift
of
my
revery
as
i
lay
basking
on
the
hot
sands
of
inyo
realizing
fully
the
geological
history
and
hard
materialistic
reality
of
mount
whitney
its
mineral
nature
its
chemistry
yet
archaic
impulse
even
then
held
me
and
the
gaunt
gray
old
indian
who
came
slowly
toward
me
must
have
subtly
felt
my
condition
for
he
crouched
beside
me
and
silently
fixed
his
hawk
eye
upon
the
peak
at
last
he
drew
an
arrow
sighted
along
its
straight
shaft
bringing
the
obsidian
head
to
bear
on
mount
whitney
and
in
strange
fragments
of
language
told
me
that
the
peak
was
an
old
old
man
who
watched
this
valley
and
cared
for
the
indians
but
who
shook
the
country
with
earthquakes
to
punish
the
whites
for
injustice
toward
his
tribe
i
looked
at
his
whitened
hair
and
keen
black
eye
i
watched
the
spare
bronze
face
upon
which
was
written
the
burden
of
a
hundred
dark
and
gloomy
superstitions
and
as
he
trudged
away
across
the
sands
i
could
but
feel
the
liberating
power
of
modern
culture
which
unfetters
us
from
the
more
than
iron
bands
of
myths
my
mood
vanished
with
the
savage
and
i
saw
the
great
peak
only
as
it
really
is
a
splendid
mass
of
granite
feet
high
and
a
great
monolith
left
standing
amid
the
ruins
of
a
bygone
geological
empire
xiv
the
people
if
mankind
were
offspring
of
isothermal
lines
and
topography
we
might
arrive
at
a
just
criticism
of
sierra
nevada
people
by
that
cheap
and
rapid
method
so
much
in
vogue
nowadays
among
physical
geographers
their
practice
of
dragooning
the
with
wet
and
dry
bulb
thermometers
would
help
us
to
predict
the
future
of
sierra
society
but
little
more
securely
than
madam
saint
john
who
also
deals
in
coming
events
i
fear
we
have
no
better
than
the
old
way
of
developing
what
lies
ahead
logically
from
yesterday
and
adding
large
measure
of
sympathy
with
human
aspiration
and
faith
in
divine
help
why
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
from
every
race
upon
the
planet
wanted
gold
and
twenty
years
ago
came
here
to
win
it
i
shall
not
concern
myself
to
ask
nor
can
i
formulate
very
accurately
the
proportions
of
good
bad
and
indifferent
upon
whom
the
golden
curtain
of
rolled
up
no
venerated
landmark
or
sacred
restraint
held
those
men
in
check
there
were
no
precedents
for
the
acting
no
no
prompter
no
audience
s
idee
reigned
supreme
developing
a
plot
of
riotous
situation
and
inconceivably
sudden
change
wit
and
intellect
wrought
a
condition
the
most
ambitious
savages
might
regard
with
baffled
envy
history
would
not
if
she
could
parallel
the
state
of
society
here
from
to
nor
can
we
imagine
to
what
height
of
horror
it
might
have
reached
had
the
sierra
drainage
held
unlimited
gold
those
were
lively
days
the
penniless
still
looks
back
to
them
with
bleared
eyes
as
the
one
period
of
his
life
dust
was
plenty
and
to
be
had
if
not
for
digging
at
the
modest
price
of
a
bullet
to
prove
the
soil
s
fertility
he
tells
you
proudly
how
in
those
years
wild
oats
on
every
hill
grew
tall
enough
to
be
tied
across
your
this
irony
of
nature
has
passed
away
but
the
cursed
plant
ripens
its
hundredfold
in
life
and
manner
no

familiar
with
society
as
it
then
was
feels
the
least
surprise
that
bret
harte
should
deal
so
largely
in
morbid
anatomy
or
appear
to
search
painfully
for
a
single
noble
trait
to
redeem
the
common
bad
yet
not
universal
bad
for
there
were
not
wanting
a
few
strong
christian
men
who
amid
all
kept
their
eyes
on
the
one
model
leading
lives
blameless
if
obscure
broadly
through
all
kinds
and
conditions
shone
the
virtue
of
generous
if
not
hospitality
a
sort
of
fraternity
banded
together
the
honest
miners
they
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
common
quest
of
gold
in
united
effort
to
make
the
camp
lively
the
fraternity
too
often
emulated
that
of
cain
or
wore
a
ghastly
likeness
to
the
commune
that
those
desperadoes
who
through
the
long
chain
of
mining
towns
outnumbered
respectable
men
had
so
generally
the
fixed
habit
of
killing
one
another
should
rather
be
written
down
to
their
credit
that
they
never
married
to
hand
down
lawless
traits
seems
their
crowning
virtue
for
a
few
years
the
solemn
pines
looked
down
on
a
mad
carnival
of
godless
license
a
pandemonium
in
whose
picturesque
delirium
human
character
crumbled
and
vanished
like
dead
leaves
it
was
stirring
and
gay
but
melpomene
s
pathetic
face
was
always
under
that
laughing
mask
of
comedy
this
is
the
unpromising
origin
of
our
sierra
civilization
it
may
be
instructive
to
note
some
early
steps
of
improvement
a
protest
first
silent
then
loud
which
went
up
against
disorder
and
crime
and
later
the
inauguration
of
justice
in
form
if
not
in
reality
there
occurs
to
me
an
incident
illustrating
these
first
essays
in
civil
law
it
is
vouched
for
by
my
friend
an
unwilling
actor
in
the
affair
exactly
why
should
have
been
so
early
recognized
as
a
heinous
sin
it
is
not
easy
to
discover
however
that
might
be
murderers
continued
to
notch
the
number
of
their
victims
on
neatly
kept
hilts
of
pistols
or
knives
in
comparative
security
long
after
the
horse
thief
began
to
meet
his
hempen
fate
early
in
the
fifties
on
a
still
hot
summer
s
afternoon
a
certain
man
in
a
camp
of
the
northern
mines
which
shall
be
nameless
having
tracked
his
two
donkeys
and
one
horse
a
and
discovering
that
a
man
s
track
with
followed
them
came
back
to
town
and
told
the
boys
who
loitered
about
a
popular
saloon
that
in
his
opinion
some
mexican
had
stole
the
such
news
as
this
naturally
demanded
drinks
all
around
do
you
know
gentlemen
said
one
who
assumed
leadership
that
just
naturally
to
shoot
these
greasers
ain
t
the
best
way
give
em
a
fair
jury
trial
and
rope
em
up
with
all
the
majesty
of
law
that
s
the
such
words
of
moderation
were
well
received
and
they
drank
again
to
here
s
hoping
we
ketch
that
as
they
loafed
back
to
the
veranda
a
mexican
walked
over
the
hill
brow
jingling
his
spurs
pleasantly
in
accord
with
a
whistled
waltz
the
advocate
for
law
said
in
undertone
that
s
the
a
rush
a
struggle
and
the
mexican
bound
hand
and
foot
lay
on
his
back
in
the
the
camp
turned
out
to
a
man
happily
such
cries
as
string
him
up
burn
the
doggoned
lubricator
and
other
equally
pleasant
phrases
fell
unheeded
upon
his
spanish
ear
a
jury
upon
which
they
forced
my
friend
was
quickly
gathered
in
the
street
and
despite
refusals
to
serve
the
crowd
hurried
them
in
behind
the
bar
a
brief
statement
of
the
case
was
made
by
the
advocate
and
they
shoved
the
jury
into
a
commodious
where
were
seats
grouped
about
neat
green
tables
the
noise
outside
in
the
by
and
by
died
away
into
complete
silence
but
from
afar
down
the
cañon
came
confused
sounds
as
of
disorderly
cheering
they
came
nearer
and
again
the
noise
of
human
laughter
mingled
with
clinking
glasses
around
the
bar
a
low
knock
at
the
jury
door
the
lock
burst
in
and
a
dozen
smiling
fellows
asked
the
verdict
a
foreman
promptly
answered
with
volleyed
oaths
and
ominous
laying
of
hands
on
pistol
hilts
the
boys
slammed
the
door
with
you
ll
have
to
do
better
than
that
in
half
an
hour
the
advocate
gently
opened
the
door
again
your
gentlemen
guilty
correct
you
can
come
out
we
hung
him
an
hour
the
jury
took
theirs
neat
and
when
after
a
few
minutes
the
pleasant
village
returned
to
its
former
tranquillity
it
was
allowed
at
more
than
one
saloon
that
mexicans
ll
know
enough
to
let
white
men
s
stock
alone
after
one
and
another
exchanged
the
belief
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
more
sensible
than
nipping
em
on
when
before
sunset
the
concluded
to
sweep
some
dust
out
of
his
he
felt
a
momentary
surprise
at
finding
the
missing
horse
dozing
under
the
shadow
of
an
oak
and
the
two
lost
donkeys
serenely
masticating
of
which
many
bushels
lay
in
a
dusty
pile
he
was
reminded
then
that
the
animals
had
been
there
all
day
during
three
or
four
years
the
battle
between
good
and
bad
became
more
and
more
determined
until
all
positive
characters
arrayed
themselves
either
for
or
against
public
order
at
length
on
a
sudden
the
party
for
right
organized
those
august
mobs
the
vigilance
committees
and
quickly
began
to
festoon
their
more
depraved
from
tree
to
tree
rogues
of
sufficient
shrewdness
got
themselves
enrolled
in
the
vigilance
ranks
and
were
soon
unable
to
tell
themselves
from
the
most
virtuous
those
quiet
oaks
whose
hundreds
of
sunny
years
had
been
spent
in
lengthening
out
glorious
branches
now
found
themselves
playing
the
part
of
public
gibbet
let
it
be
distinctly
understood
that
i
am
not
passing
criticism
on
the
san
francisco
organization
which
i
have
never
investigated
but
on
committees
in
the
mountain
towns
with
whose
performance
i
am
familiar
the
vigilants
quickly
put
out
of
existence
a
majority
of
the
worst
desperadoes
and
by
their
swift
merciless
action
struck
such
terror
to
the
rest
that
ever
after
the
right
has
mainly
controlled
affairs
this
was
well
with
characteristic
promptness
they
laid
down
their
power
and
gave
california
over
to
the
constituted
authorities
this
was
magnificent
they
deserve
the
commendation
due
to
success
they
have
however
such
a
frank
honest
way
of
singing
their
praise
such
eternal
undisguised
and
virtuous
over
the
whole
matter
that
no
one
else
need
interrupt
them
with
fainter
notes
although
this
generation
has
written
its
indorsement
in
full
upon
the
transaction
it
may
be
doubted
if
history
how
long
is
it
before
dispassionate
candor
speaks
will
trace
an
altogether
favorable
verdict
upon
her
pages
possibly
to
fulfil
the
golden
round
of
duty
it
is
needful
to
do
right
in
the
right
way
and
success
may
not
be
proven
the
eternal
test
of
merit
that
the
vigilance
committees
grasped
the
moral
power
is
undeniable
that
they
used
it
for
the
public
salvation
is
equally
true
but
the
best
advocates
are
far
from
showing
that
with
skill
and
moderation
they
might
not
have
thrown
their
weight
into
the
scale
law
and
conquered
by
means
of
legislature
judge
and
jury
a
peace
wholly
free
from
the
stain
of
lawless
blood
an
impartial
future
may
possibly
grant
the
plenary
inspiration
of
vigilance
committees
perhaps
that
better
choice
was
in
truth
denied
them
it
may
be
the
hour
demanded
a
sudden
blow
of
whether
better
or
best
the
act
has
not
left
unmixed
blessing
although
it
now
seems
as
if
the
lawlessness
which
even
till
these
later
years
has
from
time
to
time
manifested
itself
is
gradually
and
surely
dying
out
yet
as
i
write
state
troops
are
encamped
at
amador
to
suppress
a
spirit
which
has
taken
law
in
its
own
hand
with
the
gradual
decline
of
gold
product
something
like
social
equilibrium
asserted
itself
by
california
had
made
the
vast
inspiring
stride
from
barbarism
to
vulgarity
in
failing
and
the
gradual
abandonment
of
to
chinamen
there
is
abundant
pathos
you
see
it
in
a
hundred
towns
and
camps
where
empty
buildings
in
disrepair
stand
in
rows
no
nailing
up
of
blinds
or
closing
of
doors
hides
the
vacancy
the
cheap
squalor
of
chinese
streets
adds
misery
to
the
scene
besides
scenting
a
pure
mountain
air
with
odors
of
complete
wretchedness
pigs
prowl
the
streets
every
deserted
cabin
knows
a
story
of
brave
manly
effort
ended
in
bitter
failure
and
the
lingering
stranded
men
have
a
melancholy
look
as
of
faint
fish
the
ebb
has
left
to
die
i
recall
one
town
into
which
our
party
rode
at
evening
a
single
family
alone
remained
too
desperately
poor
to
leave
their
home
all
the
other
buildings
church
the
saloons
and
many
dwellings
standing
with
doors
their
cloth
walls
and
ceilings
torn
down
to
make
squaws
petticoats
if
our
horses
in
the
great
deserted
livery
stable
were
as
comfortable
as
we
who
each
made
his
bed
on
a
billiard
table
they
did
well
with
this
slow
decay
the
venturous
both
good
and
bad
have
drifted
off
to
other
mining
countries
leaving
most
often
small
cause
to
regret
them
pathos
and
comedy
so
tenderly
blent
can
rarely
be
found
as
here
enterprise
has
shrunken
away
from
its
old
belongings
a
feeble
rill
of
trade
trickles
down
the
broad
channel
of
former
affluence
those
few
who
linger
ought
to
be
gently
preserved
for
historic
specimens
as
we
used
to
care
for
that
in
the
boston
bricks
or
whatever
might
remind
this
youthful
country
of
a
past
they
are
altogether
harmless
now
possessing
the
peculiar
charm
of
lions
with
drawn
teeth
behold
this
relic
a
type
known
as
the
real
virginia
gentleman
as
of
a
mild
summer
twilight
he
walks
along
the
quiet
street
clad
in
black
broadcloth
and
spotless
linen
a
heavy
cane
hanging
by
its
curved
handle
from
his
wrist
he
pauses
by
the
s
loon
receiving
respectful
salutation
from
a
mild
company
of
bummers
who
hold
him
in
awe
and
call
him
nothing
less
than
they
omit
their
habitual
and
are
at
pains
to
swallow
as
stiff
a
glass
and
as
neat
as
their
hero
the
judge
is
reminded
of
livelier
days
by
certain
unhealed
in
ceiling
and
wall
and
recounts
for
the
hundredth
time
in
chaste
language
the
whole
affair
and
in
particular
how
jack
blew
the
top
of
alabam
s
head
off
and
that
stopped
it
all
we
buried
the
six
the
judge
continues
side
and
side
and
it
wasn
t
a
week
before
two
of
us
found
old
jack
and
his
partner
on
the
same
limb
and
they
made
eight
graves
the
ball
that
made
that
hole
went
through
my
hat
and
i
travelled
after
that
for
awhile
till
the
thing
sort
of
blew
over
ah
boys
he
winds
up
in
tones
tremulous
with
tearful
regret
you
fellows
will
never
see
such
lively
times
as
we
of
the
early
his
tall
figure
passes
on
with
uncertain
gait
stopping
at
garden
fences
here
and
there
to
execute
one
or
two
compliments
for
the
ladies
who
are
spending
their
evenings
under
porches
and
when
he
takes
an
by
invitation
and
begins
a
story
laid
in
the
spring
of
the
judge
is
conscious
in
his
heart
that
the
full
saloon
veranda
is
looking
and
saying
the
always
did
like
the
rough
too
still
stays
in
almost
every
camp
he
evaded
rope
by
joining
the
vigilants
and
has
become
a
safe
and
fangless
wolf
in
sheep
s
clothing
he
found
early
that
he
could
sponge
and
swindle
a
larger
amount
from
any
given
community
than
could
be
plundered
to
say
nothing
of
the
advantages
of
personal
security
but
now
all
these
characters
are
god
be
thanked
few
and
widely
scattered
our
present
census
enrolls
a
safe
honest
reputable
population
who
respect
law
and
personal
rights
and
who
besides
look
into
the
future
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
resolve
it
is
very
much
the
habit
of
newly
arrived
people
to
link
the
past
and
present
too
closely
in
their
estimate
of
the
existing
status
that
dreadful
nightmare
of
early
years
is
unfortunately
not
to
say
cruelly
mixed
up
with
i
think
this
must
in
great
measure
account
for
the
virtuous
horror
of
that
saintly
army
of
travellers
who
write
about
california
taking
pains
to
open
fire
at
sublimely
long
range
with
their
very
hottest
shot
upon
the
devoted
dwellers
here
such
bombardment
in
large
pica
with
all
the
added
severity
of
does
not
interrupt
the
sierra
tranquillity
they
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
as
in
the
days
of
noah
regardless
of
explosions
of
many
literary
batteries
nor
is
this
peaceful
state
altogether
because
the
projectiles
fall
short
there
are
people
here
who
read
and
read
thoroughly
can
we
think
them
if
surprised
when
after
opening
heart
and
doors
to
scribbling
visitors
they
find
themselves
held
up
to
ridicule
or
execration
in
unimpeachable
english
and
tasteful
typography
an
equally
false
impression
is
spread
by
that
considerable
class
of
men
whose
courage
and
energy
were
not
enough
to
win
in
open
contest
there
and
who
publicly
shake
off
dust
from
departing
feet
go
east
in
ballast
and
make
a
virtue
of
burning
their
ships
forgetful
that
for
one
waterlogged
craft
a
hundred
stanch
keels
will
furrow
the
golden
gate
between
the
cruelly
superficial
criticism
of
most
eastern
writers
and
dark
predictions
from
those
smug
prophets
the
physical
geographers
californians
have
nothing
left
them
but
their
own
conscious
power
not
the
poorest
reliance
in
practical
business
like
building
futures
one
should
say
i
am
not
going
to
deny
that
even
yet
there
flickers
up
now
and
then
a
lingering
flame
of
that
inferno
if
i
did
the
lively
and
picturesque
of
austrian
george
the
other
day
would
be
moved
to
amend
me
we
must
admit
the
facts
california
people
are
not
living
in
a
tranquil
healthy
social
they
are
provincial
never
however
in
a
local
way
but
by
reason
of
limited
thought
aspirations
for
wealth
and
ease
rise
conspicuously
above
any
thirst
for
intellectual
culture
and
moral
peace
energy
and
a
glorious
audacity
are
their
leading
traits
to
the
charge
of
gayety
so
freely
trumpeted
by
graver
home
critics
i
plead
them
guilty
there
is
nowhere
that
dull
weary
expression
and
rayless
sedateness
of
face
we
of
new
england
are
fonder
of
ascribing
to
our
tender
conscience
than
to
east
winds
so
too
are
wanting
difficulties
of
bronchia
and
lungs
which
might
inferentially
be
symptoms
of
original
sin
is
californian
cheerfulness
due
to
moral
levity
or
to
perpetual
sunshine
and
green
salads
through
the
round
year
tempting
weak
human
nature
to
smile
i
believe
it
climatic
and
humbly
offer
my
tribute
to
the
who
among
many
ventures
has
this
time
probably
stumbled
upon
truth
let
us
not
grieve
because
the
writers
and
lecturers
have
not
found
californian
society
all
their
ideals
demanded
for
saving
always
the
readers
of
past
and
future
their
dictum
is
confined
to
existing
conditions
have
they
forgotten
that
these
are
less
potent
factors
in
development
than
the
impulse
that
what
a
man
is
of
far
less
consequence
than
what
he
is
show
these
gloomy
critics
a
bare
stretch
of
vulgar
sierra
earth
and
they
will
tell
you
how
barren
how
valueless
it
is
ignorant
that
the
art
of
any
californian
can
banish
every
grain
of
sand
into
the
pacific
s
bottom
and
gather
a
residuum
of
solid
gold
out
of
the
race
of
men
whom
they
have
in
the
same
shallow
way
called
common
i
believe
time
shall
separate
a
noble
race
travelling
in
sierras
one
may
see
the
old
rude
scars
of
mining
trenches
yawn
disordered
heaps
cumber
the
ground
yet
they
are
no
longer
bare
time
with
friendly
rain
and
wind
and
flood
slowly
surely
levels
all
and
a
compassionate
cover
of
innocent
verdure
weaves
fresh
and
cool
from
mile
to
mile
while
nature
thus
gently
heals
the
humble
earth
god
who
is
also
nature
moulds
and
changes
man
the
end
