glengarry
school
days
chapter
i
the
the
twentieth
school
was
built
of
logs
hewn
on
two
sides
the
cracks
were
chinked
and
filled
with
plaster
which
had
a
curious
habit
of
falling
out
during
the
summer
months
no
one
knew
how
but
somehow
the
holes
always
appeared
on
the
boys
side
and
being
there
were
found
to
be
most
useful
for
as
looking
out
of
the
window
was
forbidden
through
these
holes
the
boys
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
outer
world
glimpses
worth
catching
too
for
all
around
stood
the
great
forest
the
playground
of
boys
and
girls
during
and
recesses
an
enchanted
land
peopled
not
by
fairies
elves
and
other
shadowy
beings
of
fancy
but
with
living
things
squirrels
and
chipmunks
and
weasels
chattering
thumping
rabbits
and
stealthy
foxes
not
to
speak
of
a
host
of
flying
things
from
the
little
that
twittered
its
happy
nonsense
all
day
to
the
owl
that
hooted
solemnly
when
the
moon
came
out
a
wonderful
place
this
forest
for
children
to
live
in
to
know
and
to
love
and
in
after
days
to
long
for
it
was
friday
afternoon
and
the
long
hot
july
day
was
drawing
to
a
weary
close
mischief
was
in
the
air
and
the
master
archibald
munro
or
archie
murro
as
the
boys
called
him
was
holding
himself
in
with
a
very
firm
hand
the
lines
about
his
mouth
showing
that
he
was
fighting
back
the
pain
which
had
never
quite
left
him
from
the
day
he
had
twisted
his
knee
out
of
joint
five
years
ago
in
a
wrestling
match
and
which
in
his
weary
moments
gnawed
into
his
vitals
he
hated
to
lose
his
grip
of
himself
for
then
he
knew
he
should
have
to
grow
stern
and
terrifying
and
rule
these
young
imps
in
the
forms
in
front
of
him
by
what
he
called
afterwards
in
his
moments
of
sheer
brute
force
and
that
he
always
counted
a
defeat
munro
was
a
born
commander
his
pale
intellectual
face
with
its
square
chin
and
firm
mouth
its
noble
forehead
and
gray
eyes
carried
a
look
of
such
strength
and
indomitable
courage
that
no
boy
however
big
ever
thought
of
anything
but
obedience
when
the
word
of
command
came
he
was
the
only
master
who
had
ever
been
able
to
control
without
at
least
one
appeal
to
the
trustees
the
stormy
tempers
of
the
young
giants
that
used
to
come
to
school
in
the
winter
months
the
school
never
forgot
the
day
when
big
bob
fraser
answered
back
in
class
for
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
lips
the
master
with
a
single
stride
was
in
front
of
him
and
laying
two
swift
stinging
cuts
from
the
rawhide
over
big
bob
back
commanded
hold
out
your
hand
in
a
voice
so
terrible
and
with
eyes
of
such
blazing
light
that
before
bob
was
aware
he
shot
out
his
hand
and
stood
waiting
the
blow
the
school
never
in
all
its
history
received
such
a
thrill
as
the
next
few
moments
brought
for
while
bob
stood
waiting
the
master
words
fell
upon
the
dead
silence
no
robert
you
are
too
big
to
thrash
you
are
a
man
no
man
should
strike
you
and
i
and
then
big
bob
forgot
his
wonted
sheepishness
and
spoke
out
with
a
voice
i
am
sorry
i
spoke
back
and
then
all
the
girls
began
to
cry
and
wipe
their
eyes
with
their
aprons
while
the
master
and
bob
shook
hands
silently
from
that
day
and
hour
bob
fraser
would
have
slain
any
one
offering
to
make
trouble
for
the
master
and
archibald
rule
was
firmly
established
he
was
just
and
impartial
in
all
his
decisions
and
absolute
in
his
control
and
besides
he
had
the
rare
faculty
of
awakening
in
his
pupils
an
enthusiasm
for
work
inside
the
school
and
for
sports
outside
but
now
he
was
holding
himself
in
and
with
set
teeth
keeping
back
the
pain
the
week
had
been
long
and
hot
and
trying
and
this
day
had
been
the
worst
of
all
through
the
little
dirty
panes
of
the
uncurtained
windows
the
hot
sun
had
poured
itself
in
a
flood
of
quivering
light
all
the
long
day
only
an
hour
remained
of
the
day
but
that
hour
was
to
the
master
the
hardest
of
all
the
week
the
big
boys
were
droning
lazily
over
their
books
the
little
boys
in
the
forms
just
below
his
desk
were
bubbling
over
with
spirits
spirits
of
whose
origin
there
was
no
reasonable
ground
for
doubt
suddenly
hughie
murray
the
minister
boy
a
very
special
imp
held
up
his
hand
well
hughie
said
the
master
for
the
tenth
time
within
the
hour
replying
to
the
signal
the
master
hesitated
it
would
be
a
vast
relief
but
it
was
a
little
like
shirking
on
all
sides
however
hands
went
up
in
support
of
hughie
proposal
and
having
hesitated
he
felt
he
must
surrender
or
become
terrifying
at
once
very
well
he
said
margaret
aird
and
thomas
finch
will
act
as
at
once
there
was
a
gleeful
hubbub
slates
and
books
were
slung
into
desks
order
or
no
the
alternative
was
awful
enough
to
quiet
even
the
impish
hughie
who
knew
the
tone
carried
no
idle
threat
and
who
loved
a
with
all
the
ardor
of
his
little
fighting
soul
the
captains
took
their
places
on
each
side
of
the
school
and
with
careful
deliberation
began
the
selecting
of
their
men
scanning
anxiously
the
rows
of
faces
looking
at
the
maps
or
out
of
the
windows
and
bravely
trying
to
seem
unconcerned
chivalry
demanded
that
margaret
should
have
first
choice
hughie
murray
called
out
margaret
for
hughie
though
only
eight
years
old
had
preternatural
gifts
in
spelling
his
mother
training
had
done
that
for
him
at
four
he
knew
every
bible
story
by
heart
and
would
tolerate
no
liberties
with
the
text
at
six
he
could
read
the
third
reader
at
eight
he
was
the
best
reader
in
the
fifth
and
to
do
him
justice
he
thought
no
better
of
himself
for
that
it
was
no
trick
to
read
if
he
could
only
run
and
climb
and
swim
and
dive
like
the
big
boys
then
he
would
indeed
feel
uplifted
but
mere
spelling
and
reading
huh
that
was
ranald
macdonald
called
thomas
finch
and
a
big
lanky
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
rose
and
marched
to
his
place
he
was
a
boy
one
would
look
at
twice
he
was
far
from
handsome
his
face
was
long
and
thin
and
dark
with
a
straight
nose
and
large
mouth
and
high
but
he
had
fine
black
eyes
though
they
were
fierce
and
had
a
look
in
them
that
suggested
the
woods
and
the
wild
things
that
live
there
but
ranald
though
his
attendance
was
spasmodic
and
dependent
upon
the
suitability
or
otherwise
of
the
weather
for
hunting
was
the
best
speller
in
the
school
for
that
reason
margaret
would
have
chosen
him
and
for
another
which
she
would
not
for
worlds
have
confessed
even
to
herself
and
do
you
think
she
would
have
called
ranald
macdonald
to
come
and
stand
up
beside
her
before
all
these
boys
not
for
the
glory
of
winning
the
match
and
carrying
the
medal
for
a
week
but
how
gladly
would
she
have
given
up
glory
and
medal
for
the
joy
of
it
if
she
had
dared
at
length
the
choosing
was
over
and
the
school
ranged
in
two
opposing
lines
with
margaret
and
thomas
at
the
head
of
their
respective
forces
and
little
jessie
macrae
and
johnnie
aird
with
a
single
big
curl
on
the
top
of
his
head
at
the
foot
it
was
a
point
of
honor
that
no
blood
should
be
drawn
at
the
first
round
to
thomas
who
had
second
choice
fell
the
right
of
giving
the
first
word
so
to
little
jessie
at
the
foot
he
gave
ox
whispered
jessie
shyly
dodging
behind
her
neighbor
in
said
margaret
to
johnnie
aird
in
said
johnnie
stoutly
right
said
the
master
silencing
the
shout
of
laughter
next
with
like
gentle
courtesies
the
battle
began
but
in
the
second
round
the
little
a
b
c
were
ruthlessly
swept
off
the
field
with
words
and
retired
to
their
seats
in
supreme
exultation
amid
the
applause
of
their
fellows
still
left
in
the
fight
after
that
there
was
no
mercy
it
was
a
battle
the
successful
speller
having
the
right
to
give
the
word
to
the
opposite
side
the
master
was
umpire
and
after
his
next
had
fallen
there
was
no
appeal
but
if
a
mistake
were
made
it
was
the
opponent
part
and
privilege
to
correct
with
all
speed
lest
a
second
attempt
should
succeed
steadily
and
amid
growing
excitement
the
lines
grew
less
till
there
were
left
on
one
side
thomas
with
ranald
supporting
him
and
on
the
other
margaret
with
hughie
beside
her
his
face
pale
and
his
dark
eyes
blazing
with
the
light
of
battle
without
varying
fortune
the
fight
went
on
margaret
still
serene
and
with
only
a
touch
of
color
in
her
face
gave
out
her
words
with
even
voice
and
spelled
her
opponent
with
calm
deliberation
opposite
her
thomas
stood
stolid
slow
and
wary
he
had
no
nerves
to
speak
of
and
the
only
chance
of
catching
him
lay
in
lulling
him
off
to
sleep
they
were
now
among
the
deadly
words
parallelopiped
challenged
hughie
to
ranald
who
met
it
easily
giving
margaret
hyphen
in
return
spelled
margaret
and
then
with
cunning
carelessness
gave
thomas
hypher
she
called
it
thomas
took
it
lightly
like
lightning
hughie
was
upon
him
shouted
thomas
the
two
yells
came
almost
together
there
was
a
deep
silence
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
master
i
think
hughie
was
first
he
said
slowly
a
great
sigh
swept
over
the
school
and
then
a
wave
of
applause
the
master
held
up
his
hand
but
it
was
so
very
nearly
a
tie
that
if
hughie
is
willing
all
right
sir
cried
hughie
eager
for
more
fight
but
thomas
in
sullen
rage
strode
to
his
seat
muttering
i
was
just
as
soon
every
one
heard
and
waited
looking
at
the
master
the
match
is
over
said
the
master
quietly
great
disappointment
showed
in
every
face
there
is
just
one
thing
better
than
winning
and
that
is
taking
defeat
like
a
his
voice
was
grave
and
with
just
a
touch
of
sadness
the
children
sensitive
to
moods
as
is
the
characteristic
of
children
felt
the
touch
and
sat
subdued
and
silent
there
was
no
improving
of
the
occasion
but
with
the
same
sad
gravity
the
school
was
dismissed
and
the
children
learned
that
day
one
of
life
golden
lessons
that
the
man
who
remains
master
of
himself
never
knows
defeat
the
master
stood
at
the
door
watching
the
children
go
down
the
slope
to
the
road
and
then
take
their
ways
north
and
south
till
the
forest
hid
them
from
his
sight
well
he
muttered
stretching
up
his
arms
and
drawing
a
great
breath
it
over
for
another
week
a
pretty
near
thing
chapter
ii
the
deepole
archibald
munro
had
a
steady
purpose
in
life
to
play
the
man
and
to
allow
no
pain
of
his
and
pain
never
left
him
long
to
spoil
his
work
or
to
bring
a
shadow
to
the
life
of
any
other
and
though
he
had
his
hard
times
no
one
who
could
not
read
the
lines
about
his
mouth
ever
knew
how
hard
they
were
it
was
this
struggle
for
that
made
him
the
man
he
was
and
taught
him
the
secrets
of
nobleness
that
he
taught
his
pupils
with
their
three
r
and
this
was
the
best
of
his
work
for
the
twentieth
school
north
and
south
in
front
of
the
school
the
road
ran
through
the
deep
forest
of
great
pines
with
underbrush
of
balsam
and
spruce
and
but
from
this
main
road
ran
little
blazed
paths
that
led
to
the
farm
clearings
where
lay
the
children
homes
here
and
there
set
in
their
massive
frames
of
dark
green
forest
lay
the
little
farms
the
tiny
fenced
fields
surrounding
the
little
log
houses
and
barns
these
were
the
homes
of
a
people
simple
of
heart
and
manners
but
sturdy
clean
living
and
clear
thinking
with
their
brittle
highland
courage
toughened
to
endurance
by
their
long
fight
with
the
forest
and
with
a
born
of
victory
over
nature
grimmest
of
terrors
a
mile
straight
south
of
the
school
stood
the
manse
which
was
home
two
miles
straight
west
ranald
lived
and
thomas
finch
two
miles
north
while
the
other
lads
ought
to
have
taken
some
of
the
little
paths
that
branched
east
from
the
main
road
but
this
evening
with
one
accord
the
boys
chose
a
path
that
led
from
the
clearing
straight
southwest
through
the
forest
what
a
path
that
was
beaten
smooth
with
the
passing
of
many
bare
feet
it
wound
through
the
brush
and
round
the
big
pines
past
the
haunts
of
squirrels
black
gray
and
red
past
fox
holes
and
woodchuck
holes
under
birds
nests
and
and
best
of
all
it
brought
up
at
last
at
the
deep
hole
or
deepole
as
the
boys
called
it
there
were
many
reasons
why
the
boys
should
have
gone
straight
home
they
were
expected
home
there
were
cows
to
get
up
from
the
pasture
and
to
milk
potatoes
that
needed
hoeing
gardens
to
weed
not
to
speak
of
messages
and
the
like
but
these
were
also
excellent
reasons
why
the
boys
should
unanimously
choose
the
cool
shady
path
that
wound
and
twisted
through
the
trees
and
brush
but
led
straight
to
the
deepole
besides
this
was
friday
night
it
was
hot
and
they
were
tired
out
the
mere
thought
of
the
long
walk
home
was
intolerable
the
deepole
was
only
two
miles
away
and
there
was
lots
of
time
for
anything
else
so
with
wild
whoops
they
turned
into
the
shady
path
and
sped
through
the
forest
the
big
boys
in
front
with
ranald
easily
leading
for
there
was
no
runner
so
swift
and
tireless
in
all
the
and
hughie
with
the
small
boys
panting
behind
on
they
went
a
long
straggling
yelling
line
down
into
the
cedar
swamp
splashing
through
the
little
crick
and
up
again
over
the
beech
ridge
where
in
the
open
woods
the
path
grew
indistinct
and
was
easy
to
lose
then
again
among
the
great
pines
where
the
underbrush
was
so
thick
that
you
could
not
tell
what
might
be
just
before
till
they
pulled
up
at
the
old
lumber
camp
the
boys
always
paused
at
the
ruins
of
the
old
lumber
camp
a
ruin
is
ever
a
place
of
mystery
but
to
the
old
lumber
camp
attached
an
awful
dread
for
behind
it
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
underbrush
stood
the
cabin
of
alan
gorrach
alan
was
a
name
of
terror
among
all
the
small
children
of
the
section
mothers
hushed
their
crying
with
alan
gorrach
will
get
alan
was
a
small
man
short
in
the
legs
but
with
long
swinging
sinewy
arms
he
had
a
gypsy
face
and
tangled
long
black
hair
and
as
he
walked
through
the
forest
he
might
be
heard
talking
to
himself
with
wild
gesticulations
he
was
an
itinerant
cooper
by
trade
and
made
for
the
farmers
wives
their
and
and
coggies
and
for
the
men
axe
handles
and
the
like
but
in
the
boys
eyes
he
was
guilty
of
a
horrible
iniquity
he
was
a
his
chief
business
was
the
doing
away
with
dogs
of
in
the
country
vicious
dogs
dogs
dogs
were
committed
to
alan
dread
custody
and
often
he
would
be
seen
leading
off
his
wretched
victims
to
his
den
in
the
woods
whence
they
never
returned
it
was
a
current
report
that
he
ate
them
too
no
wonder
the
boys
regarded
him
with
horror
mingled
with
fearful
awe
in
broad
day
upon
the
high
road
the
small
boys
would
boldly
fling
taunts
and
stones
at
alan
till
he
would
pull
out
his
long
sharp
cooper
knife
and
make
at
them
but
if
they
met
him
in
the
woods
they
would
walk
past
in
trembling
and
respectful
silence
or
slip
off
into
hiding
in
the
bush
till
he
was
out
of
sight
it
was
always
part
of
the
programme
in
the
exploring
of
the
lumber
camp
for
the
big
boys
to
steal
down
the
path
to
alan
cabin
and
peer
fearfully
through
the
brush
and
then
come
rushing
back
to
the
little
boys
waiting
in
the
clearing
and
crying
in
stage
whispers
he
coming
he
coming
set
off
again
through
the
bush
like
hunted
deer
followed
by
the
panting
train
of
youngsters
with
their
small
hearts
thumping
hard
against
their
ribs
in
a
few
minutes
the
pine
woods
with
its
old
lumber
camp
and
fearsome
cabin
were
left
behind
and
then
down
along
the
flats
where
the
big
elms
were
and
the
tall
and
the
alders
the
flying
panting
line
sped
on
in
a
final
dash
for
they
could
smell
the
river
in
a
moment
more
they
were
at
the
deepole
o
that
deepole
where
the
big
creek
took
a
great
sweep
around
before
it
tore
over
the
rapids
and
down
into
the
gorge
it
was
always
in
cool
shade
the
great
hung
far
out
over
it
and
the
alders
and
the
willows
edged
its
banks
how
cool
and
clear
the
dark
brown
waters
looked
and
how
beautiful
the
golden
mottling
on
their
smooth
flowing
surface
where
the
sun
rained
down
through
the
elm
boughs
and
the
grassy
sward
where
the
boys
tore
off
their
garments
and
whence
they
raced
and
plunged
was
so
green
and
firm
and
smooth
under
foot
and
the
music
of
the
rapids
down
in
the
gorge
and
the
gurgle
of
the
water
where
it
sucked
in
under
the
jam
of
dead
wood
before
it
plunged
into
the
boiling
pool
farther
down
not
that
the
boys
made
note
of
all
these
delights
accessory
to
the
joys
of
the
deepole
itself
but
all
these
helped
to
weave
the
spell
that
the
cast
over
them
without
the
spreading
elms
without
the
mottled
golden
light
upon
the
cool
deep
waters
and
without
the
distant
roar
of
the
little
rapid
and
the
soft
gurgle
at
the
jam
the
deepole
would
still
have
been
a
place
of
purest
delight
but
i
doubt
if
without
these
it
would
have
stolen
in
among
their
day
dreams
in
after
years
on
hot
dusty
weary
days
with
power
to
waken
in
them
a
vague
pain
and
longing
for
the
sweet
cool
woods
and
the
clear
brown
waters
oh
for
one
plunge
to
feel
the
hug
of
the
waters
their
soothing
caress
their
healing
touch
these
boys
are
men
now
such
as
are
on
the
hither
side
of
the
darker
river
but
not
a
man
of
them
can
think
on
a
hot
summer
day
of
that
cool
shaded
mottled
deepole
without
a
longing
in
his
heart
and
a
lump
in
his
throat
the
last
quarter
of
a
mile
was
always
a
dead
race
for
it
was
a
point
of
distinction
to
be
the
first
to
plunge
and
the
last
few
seconds
of
the
race
were
spent
in
the
preliminaries
of
the
disrobing
a
single
brace
slipped
off
the
shoulder
a
flutter
of
a
shirt
over
the
head
a
kick
of
the
trousers
and
whoop
plunge
hurrah
first
the
little
boys
always
waited
to
admire
the
first
series
of
plunges
for
there
were
many
series
before
the
hour
was
over
and
then
they
would
off
to
their
own
crossing
going
through
a
similar
performance
on
a
small
scale
what
an
hour
it
was
what
contests
of
swimming
and
diving
what
water
fights
and
mud
fights
what
careering
of
figures
stark
naked
through
the
rushes
and
trees
what
larks
and
pranks
and
then
the
little
boys
would
dress
a
simple
process
but
more
difficult
by
far
than
the
other
for
the
trousers
would
stick
to
the
wet
feet
no
boy
would
dream
of
a
towel
nor
dare
to
be
guilty
of
such
a
piece
of
and
the
shirt
would
get
wrong
side
out
or
would
bundle
round
the
neck
or
would
cling
to
the
wet
shoulders
till
they
had
to
get
on
their
knees
almost
to
squirm
into
it
but
that
over
all
was
over
the
brace
or
if
the
buttons
were
still
there
the
braces
were
easily
jerked
up
on
the
shoulders
and
there
you
were
coats
boots
and
stockings
were
superfluous
collars
and
ties
utterly
despised
then
the
little
ones
would
gather
on
the
grassy
bank
to
watch
the
big
ones
get
out
which
was
a
process
worth
watching
well
i
going
out
boys
one
would
say
oh
pshaw
let
have
another
all
right
but
it
the
last
then
a
long
stream
of
naked
figures
would
scramble
up
the
bank
and
rush
for
the
last
place
first
out
last
in
was
the
rule
for
the
boys
would
much
rather
jump
on
some
one
else
than
be
jumped
on
themselves
after
the
long
line
of
naked
figures
had
vanished
into
the
boiling
water
one
would
be
seen
quietly
stealing
out
and
up
the
bank
kicking
his
feet
clean
as
he
stepped
off
the
projecting
root
onto
the
grass
when
plunk
a
mud
ball
caught
him
and
back
he
must
come
it
took
them
full
two
hours
to
escape
clean
from
the
water
and
woe
betide
the
boy
last
out
on
all
sides
stood
boys
little
and
big
with
mud
balls
ready
to
fling
till
out
of
sheer
pity
he
would
be
allowed
to
come
forth
clean
then
when
all
were
dressed
and
blue
and
shivering
for
two
amphibious
hours
even
on
a
july
day
make
one
blue
more
games
would
begin
or
tag
or
jumping
or
climbing
trees
till
they
were
warm
enough
to
set
out
for
home
it
was
as
the
little
ones
were
playing
tag
that
hughie
came
to
grief
he
was
easily
king
of
his
company
and
led
the
game
quick
as
a
weasel
swift
and
wary
he
was
always
the
last
to
be
caught
around
the
trees
and
out
and
in
among
the
big
boys
he
led
the
chase
much
to
tom
disgust
who
had
not
forgotten
the
incident
not
that
he
cared
for
the
defeat
but
he
still
felt
the
bite
in
the
master
final
words
and
he
carried
a
grudge
against
the
boy
who
had
been
the
occasion
of
his
humiliation
keep
off
he
cried
angrily
as
hughie
swung
himself
round
him
but
hughie
paid
no
heed
to
tom
growl
unless
indeed
to
repeat
his
offense
with
the
result
that
as
he
flew
off
tom
caught
him
a
kick
that
hastened
his
flight
and
laid
him
flat
on
his
back
amid
the
laughter
of
the
boys
tom
said
hughie
gravely
and
slowly
so
that
they
all
stood
listening
do
you
know
what
you
kick
like
the
boys
stood
waiting
a
in
a
moment
tom
had
him
by
the
neck
and
after
a
cuff
or
two
sent
him
flying
with
a
warning
to
keep
to
himself
but
hughie
with
a
saucy
answer
was
off
again
on
his
game
circling
as
near
tom
finch
as
he
dared
and
being
as
exasperating
as
possible
till
tom
looked
as
if
he
would
like
a
chance
to
pay
him
off
the
chance
came
for
hughie
leading
the
tag
came
flying
past
tom
and
toward
the
water
hardly
realizing
what
he
was
doing
tom
stuck
out
his
foot
and
caught
him
flying
past
and
before
any
one
knew
how
it
had
happened
poor
hughie
shot
far
out
into
the
deepole
lighting
fair
on
his
stomach
there
was
a
great
shout
of
laughter
but
in
a
moment
every
one
was
calling
swim
hughie
keep
your
hands
down
do
splash
like
that
you
fool
paddle
underneath
but
hughie
was
far
too
excited
or
too
stunned
by
his
fall
to
do
anything
but
splash
and
sputter
and
sink
and
rise
again
only
to
sink
once
more
in
a
few
moments
the
affair
became
serious
the
small
boys
began
to
cry
and
some
of
the
bigger
ones
to
undress
when
there
was
a
cry
from
the
overhanging
the
water
run
out
that
board
don
quick
it
was
ranald
who
had
been
swinging
up
in
the
highest
branches
and
had
seen
what
had
happened
and
was
coming
down
from
limb
to
limb
like
a
squirrel
as
he
spoke
he
dropped
from
the
lowest
limb
into
the
water
close
to
where
hughie
was
splashing
wildly
in
an
instant
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
hughie
arms
went
round
his
neck
and
pulled
his
head
under
water
but
he
was
up
again
and
tugging
at
hughie
hands
he
cried
do
hughie
let
go
i
pull
you
out
let
go
but
hughie
with
terror
and
with
the
water
he
had
gulped
in
clung
with
a
hughie
gasped
ranald
you
drown
us
both
oh
hughie
man
let
me
pull
you
out
ca
you
something
in
the
tone
caught
hughie
ear
and
he
loosed
his
hold
and
ranald
taking
him
under
the
chin
looked
round
for
the
board
by
this
time
don
cameron
was
in
the
water
and
working
the
board
slowly
toward
the
gasping
boys
but
now
a
new
danger
threatened
the
current
had
gradually
carried
them
toward
the
log
jam
under
which
the
water
sucked
to
the
falls
below
once
under
the
jam
no
power
on
earth
could
save
hurry
up
don
called
out
ranald
anxiously
then
feeling
hughie
beginning
to
clutch
again
he
added
cheerily
it
all
right
get
but
his
face
was
gray
and
his
eyes
were
staring
for
over
his
shoulder
he
could
see
the
jam
and
he
could
feel
the
suck
of
the
water
on
his
legs
oh
ranald
you
ca
do
it
sobbed
hughie
will
i
paddle
underneath
yes
yes
paddle
hard
hughie
said
ranald
for
the
jam
was
just
at
his
back
but
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
cry
ranald
catch
it
over
the
slippery
logs
of
the
jam
came
tom
finch
pushing
out
a
plank
catch
it
he
cried
i
hold
this
end
and
ranald
caught
and
held
fast
and
the
boys
on
the
bank
gave
a
mighty
shout
soon
don
came
up
with
his
board
and
tom
catching
the
end
hauled
it
up
on
the
rolling
logs
hold
steady
there
now
cried
tom
lying
at
full
length
upon
the
logs
we
get
you
in
a
by
this
time
the
other
boys
had
pulled
a
number
of
boards
and
planks
out
of
the
jam
and
laying
them
across
the
logs
made
a
kind
of
raft
upon
which
the
exhausted
swimmers
were
gradually
hauled
and
then
brought
safe
to
shore
oh
ranald
said
tom
almost
weeping
i
did
mean
to
i
never
thought
i
awfully
oh
pshaw
said
ranald
who
was
taking
off
hughie
shirt
preparatory
to
wringing
it
i
know
besides
it
was
you
who
pulled
us
out
you
were
doing
your
best
don
of
course
but
we
would
have
gone
under
the
jam
but
for
for
ten
minutes
the
boys
stood
going
over
again
the
various
incidents
in
the
recent
dramatic
scene
extolling
the
virtues
of
ranald
don
and
thomas
in
turn
and
imitating
with
screams
of
laughter
hughie
gulps
and
splashings
while
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
it
was
their
way
of
expressing
their
emotions
of
gratitude
and
joy
for
hughie
was
dearly
loved
by
all
though
no
one
would
have
dared
to
manifest
such
weakness
as
they
were
separating
hughie
whispered
to
ranald
come
home
with
me
ranald
i
want
and
ranald
looking
down
into
the
little
white
face
went
it
would
be
many
a
day
before
he
would
get
rid
of
the
picture
of
the
white
face
with
the
staring
black
eyes
floating
on
the
dark
brown
water
beside
him
and
that
was
why
he
went
when
they
reached
the
path
to
the
manse
clearing
ranald
and
hughie
were
alone
for
some
minutes
hughie
followed
ranald
in
silence
on
a
through
the
brule
dodging
round
stumps
and
roots
and
climbing
over
fallen
trees
till
they
came
to
the
hold
on
ranald
panted
hughie
putting
on
a
spurt
and
coming
up
even
with
his
leader
are
you
warm
enough
asked
ranald
looking
down
at
the
little
flushed
face
you
bet
are
you
dry
huh
indeed
you
are
not
too
dry
said
ranald
feeling
his
wet
shirt
and
trousers
and
your
mother
will
be
i
tell
her
said
hughie
in
a
tone
of
exulting
anticipation
what
ranald
stood
dead
still
i
tell
her
replied
hughie
she
be
awful
glad
and
she
be
awful
thankful
to
you
ranald
looked
at
him
in
amazement
i
think
i
will
jist
be
going
back
now
he
said
at
length
but
hughie
seized
him
oh
ranald
you
must
come
with
he
had
pictured
himself
telling
his
mother
of
ranald
exploit
and
covering
his
hero
with
glory
but
this
was
the
very
thing
that
ranald
dreaded
and
hated
and
was
bound
to
prevent
you
will
not
be
going
to
the
deepole
again
i
warrant
you
ranald
said
with
emphasis
not
go
to
the
deepole
no
indeed
your
mother
will
put
an
end
to
that
sort
of
mother
why
not
she
will
not
be
wanting
to
have
you
hughie
laughed
scornfully
you
do
know
my
mother
she
not
afraid
of
of
but
she
will
be
telling
your
this
was
a
matter
serious
enough
to
give
hughie
pause
his
father
might
very
likely
forbid
the
deepole
there
is
no
need
for
telling
suggested
ranald
and
i
will
just
go
in
for
a
will
you
stay
for
supper
ranald
shook
his
head
the
manse
kitchen
was
a
bright
place
and
to
see
the
minister
wife
and
to
hear
her
talk
was
to
ranald
pure
delight
but
then
hughie
might
tell
and
that
would
be
too
awful
to
bear
do
ranald
pleaded
hughie
i
not
i
am
not
so
sure
as
death
still
ranald
hesitated
hughie
grew
desperate
god
may
kill
me
on
the
spot
he
cried
using
the
most
binding
of
all
oaths
known
to
the
boys
this
was
satisfactory
and
ranald
went
but
hughie
was
not
skilled
in
deceiving
and
especially
in
deceiving
his
mother
they
were
great
friends
and
hughie
shared
all
his
secrets
with
her
and
knew
that
they
were
safe
unless
they
ought
to
be
told
and
so
when
he
caught
sight
of
his
mother
waiting
for
him
before
the
door
he
left
ranald
and
thrilling
with
the
memory
of
the
awful
peril
through
which
he
had
passed
rushed
at
her
and
crying
oh
mother
he
flung
himself
into
her
arms
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
again
why
hughie
my
boy
what
the
matter
said
his
mother
holding
her
arms
tight
about
him
and
you
are
all
wet
what
is
it
but
hughie
held
her
fast
struggling
with
himself
what
is
it
she
asked
again
turning
to
ranald
we
were
running
pretty
fast
and
it
is
a
hot
day
and
but
the
clear
eyes
were
upon
him
and
ranald
found
it
difficult
to
go
on
oh
mother
you
must
ask
cried
hughie
i
promised
not
to
not
to
tell
me
hughie
the
surprise
in
the
voice
was
quite
too
much
for
hughie
oh
mother
we
did
not
want
to
frighten
you
and
i
then
you
must
keep
your
promise
come
away
in
my
boy
come
in
it
was
her
boy
first
secret
from
her
ranald
saw
the
look
of
pain
in
the
sweet
face
and
could
not
endure
it
it
was
just
nothing
murray
he
began
did
you
promise
too
ranald
no
that
i
did
not
and
there
is
nothing
much
to
tell
only
hughie
fell
into
the
deepole
and
the
boys
pulled
him
out
oh
mother
exclaimed
hughie
it
was
ranald
he
jumped
right
down
from
the
tree
right
into
the
water
and
kept
me
up
you
told
yourself
ranald
he
continued
delighted
to
be
relieved
of
his
promise
and
on
he
went
to
give
his
mother
in
his
most
picturesque
style
a
description
of
the
whole
scene
while
ranald
stood
looking
miserable
and
ashamed
and
ranald
was
ashamed
for
me
to
tell
you
and
besides
he
said
you
would
let
me
go
to
the
deepole
again
but
you
will
wo
you
mother
and
you
wo
tell
father
will
you
the
mother
stood
listening
with
face
growing
whiter
and
whiter
till
he
was
done
then
she
stooped
down
over
the
eager
face
for
some
moments
whispering
my
darling
my
darling
and
then
coming
to
ranald
she
held
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
while
she
said
in
a
voice
bravely
struggling
to
be
calm
god
reward
you
ranald
god
grant
my
boy
may
always
have
so
good
and
brave
a
friend
when
he
and
from
that
day
ranald
life
was
different
for
he
had
bound
to
him
by
a
tie
that
nothing
could
ever
break
a
friend
whose
influence
followed
him
and
steadied
and
lifted
him
up
to
greatness
long
after
the
grave
had
hidden
her
from
men
sight
chapter
iii
the
examination
the
two
years
of
archibald
munro
regime
were
the
golden
age
of
the
school
and
for
a
whole
generation
the
section
regarded
that
period
as
the
standard
for
comparison
in
the
following
years
munro
had
a
genius
for
making
his
pupils
work
they
threw
themselves
with
enthusiasm
into
all
they
undertook
studies
debate
nights
games
and
in
everything
the
master
was
the
source
of
inspiration
and
now
his
last
examination
day
had
come
and
the
whole
section
was
stirred
with
enthusiasm
for
their
master
and
with
grief
at
his
departure
the
day
before
examination
was
spent
in
cleaning
the
this
event
which
always
preceded
the
examination
was
almost
as
enjoyable
as
the
examination
day
itself
if
indeed
it
was
not
more
so
the
school
met
in
the
morning
for
a
final
polish
for
the
recitations
then
after
a
speech
by
the
master
the
little
ones
were
dismissed
and
allowed
to
go
home
though
they
never
by
any
chance
took
advantage
of
this
permission
then
the
master
and
the
bigger
boys
and
girls
set
to
work
to
prepare
the
school
for
the
great
day
the
boys
were
told
off
in
sections
some
to
get
dry
cedar
boughs
from
the
swamp
for
the
big
fire
outside
over
which
the
iron
was
swung
to
heat
the
scrubbing
water
others
off
into
the
woods
for
for
the
evergreen
decorations
others
to
draw
water
and
wait
upon
the
scrubbers
it
was
a
day
of
delightful
excitement
but
this
year
there
was
below
the
excitement
a
deep
warm
feeling
of
love
and
sadness
as
both
teacher
and
pupils
thought
of
there
was
an
additional
thrill
to
the
excitement
that
the
master
was
to
be
presented
with
a
gold
watch
and
chain
and
that
this
had
been
kept
a
dead
secret
from
him
what
a
day
it
was
with
wild
whoops
the
boys
went
off
for
the
dry
cedar
and
the
evergreens
while
the
girls
looking
very
housewifely
with
skirts
tucked
back
and
sleeves
rolled
up
began
to
sweep
and
otherwise
prepare
the
room
for
scrubbing
the
gathering
of
the
evergreens
was
a
delightful
labor
high
up
in
the
the
more
daring
boys
would
climb
and
then
holding
by
the
swaying
top
would
swing
themselves
far
out
from
the
trunk
and
come
crashing
through
the
limbs
into
the
deep
soft
snow
bringing
half
the
tree
with
them
what
larks
they
had
what
chasing
of
rabbits
along
their
beaten
runways
what
fierce
and
happy
snow
fights
and
then
the
triumph
of
their
return
laden
with
their
evergreen
trophies
to
find
the
big
fire
blazing
under
the
great
iron
kettle
and
the
water
boiling
and
the
girls
well
on
with
the
scrubbing
then
while
the
girls
scrubbed
first
the
benches
and
desks
and
last
of
all
the
floors
the
boys
washed
the
windows
and
put
up
the
evergreen
decorations
every
corner
had
its
pillar
of
green
every
window
had
its
frame
of
green
the
old
blackboard
the
occasion
of
many
a
heartache
to
the
unmathematical
was
wreathed
into
loveliness
the
maps
with
their
bewildering
boundaries
rivers
and
mountains
capes
bays
and
islands
became
for
once
worlds
of
beauty
under
the
magic
touch
of
the
greenery
on
the
wall
just
over
his
desk
the
master
wrought
out
in
evergreen
an
arching
welcome
but
later
on
the
big
girls
with
some
shy
blushing
boldly
tacked
up
underneath
an
answering
by
the
time
the
short
afternoon
had
faded
into
the
early
evening
the
school
stood
to
the
eyes
of
all
familiar
with
the
common
sordidness
of
its
everyday
dress
a
picture
of
artistic
loveliness
and
after
the
master
little
speech
of
thanks
for
their
good
work
that
afternoon
and
for
all
their
goodness
to
him
the
boys
and
girls
went
their
ways
with
that
strangely
unnameable
that
brings
an
ache
to
the
throat
but
somehow
makes
happier
for
the
ache
the
examination
day
was
the
great
school
event
of
the
year
it
was
the
social
function
of
the
section
as
well
toward
this
event
all
the
school
life
moved
and
its
approach
was
attended
by
a
deepening
excitement
shared
by
children
and
parents
alike
which
made
a
kind
of
holiday
feeling
in
the
air
the
school
opened
an
hour
later
than
ordinarily
and
the
children
came
all
in
their
sunday
clothes
the
boys
feeling
stiff
and
uncomfortable
and
regarding
each
other
with
looks
half
shy
and
half
contemptuous
realizing
that
they
were
unnatural
in
each
other
sight
the
girls
with
hair
in
marvelous
frizzes
and
shiny
ringlets
with
new
ribbons
and
white
aprons
over
their
winsey
dresses
carried
their
unwonted
grandeur
with
an
ease
and
delight
that
made
the
boys
secretly
envy
but
apparently
despise
them
the
one
unpardonable
crime
with
all
the
boys
in
that
country
was
that
of
being
the
boy
convicted
of
shoween
off
was
utterly
contemned
by
his
fellows
hence
any
delight
in
new
clothes
or
in
a
finer
appearance
than
usual
was
carefully
avoided
ranald
always
hated
new
clothes
he
felt
them
an
intolerable
burden
he
did
not
mind
his
new
homespun
flannel
check
shirt
of
mixed
red
and
white
but
the
heavy
suit
made
by
his
aunt
kirsty
felt
like
a
suit
of
mail
he
moved
heavily
in
it
and
felt
queer
and
knew
that
he
looked
as
he
felt
the
result
was
that
he
was
in
no
genial
mood
and
was
on
the
alert
for
any
indication
of
levity
at
his
expense
hughie
on
the
contrary
like
the
girls
delighted
in
new
clothes
his
new
black
suit
made
down
from
one
of
his
father
with
infinite
planning
and
pains
by
his
mother
and
finished
only
at
twelve
the
night
before
gave
him
unmixed
pleasure
and
handsome
he
looked
in
it
all
the
little
girls
proclaimed
that
in
their
shy
admiring
glances
while
the
big
girls
teased
and
petted
and
threatened
to
kiss
him
of
course
the
boys
all
scorned
him
and
his
finery
and
tried
to
take
him
down
but
hughie
was
so
unfeignedly
pleased
with
himself
and
moved
so
easily
and
naturally
in
his
grand
attire
and
was
so
cheery
and
frank
and
happy
that
no
one
thought
of
calling
him
soon
after
ten
the
sleighloads
began
to
arrive
it
was
a
mild
winter
day
when
the
snow
packed
well
and
there
fluttered
down
through
the
still
air
a
few
lazy
flakes
large
soft
and
feathery
like
bits
of
the
clouds
floating
white
against
the
blue
sky
the
sleighs
were
driven
up
to
the
door
with
a
great
flourish
and
jingle
of
bells
and
while
the
master
welcomed
the
ladies
the
fathers
and
big
brothers
drove
the
horses
to
the
shelter
of
the
pines
and
unhitching
them
tied
them
to
the
where
blanketed
and
fed
they
remained
for
the
day
within
an
hour
the
little
was
packed
the
children
crowded
tight
into
the
long
desks
and
the
visitors
on
the
benches
along
the
walls
and
in
the
seats
of
the
big
boys
and
girls
on
the
platform
were
such
of
the
trustees
as
could
muster
up
the
necessary
courage
old
peter
macrae
who
had
been
a
dominie
in
the
old
country
the
young
minister
and
his
wife
and
the
schoolteacher
from
the
first
came
the
wee
tots
who
in
serious
innocence
went
through
their
letters
and
their
ox
and
cat
combinations
and
permutations
with
great
gusto
and
distinction
then
they
were
dismissed
to
their
seats
by
a
series
of
mental
arithmetic
questions
sums
of
varying
difficulty
being
propounded
until
little
johnnie
aird
with
the
single
big
curl
on
the
top
of
his
head
was
left
alone
one
and
one
johnnie
said
the
master
smiling
down
at
the
rosy
face
three
promptly
replied
johnnie
and
retired
to
his
seat
amid
the
delighted
applause
of
visitors
and
pupils
and
followed
by
the
proud
fond
albeit
almost
tearful
gaze
of
his
mother
he
was
her
baby
born
long
after
her
other
babies
had
grown
up
into
sturdy
youth
and
all
the
dearer
for
that
then
up
through
the
readers
till
the
fifth
was
reached
the
examination
progressed
each
class
being
handed
over
to
the
charge
of
a
visitor
who
forthwith
went
upon
examination
as
truly
as
did
the
class
fifth
class
in
due
order
the
class
marched
up
to
the
chalk
line
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
master
desk
and
stood
waiting
the
reading
lesson
was
halleck
marco
bozzaris
a
selection
of
considerable
dramatic
power
and
calling
for
a
somewhat
spirited
rendering
the
master
would
not
have
chosen
this
lesson
but
he
had
laid
down
the
rule
that
there
was
to
be
no
special
drilling
of
the
pupils
for
an
exhibition
but
that
the
school
should
be
seen
doing
its
work
and
in
the
reading
the
lessons
for
the
previous
day
were
to
be
those
of
the
examination
day
by
an
evil
fortune
the
reading
for
the
day
was
the
dramatic
marco
the
master
shivered
inwardly
as
he
thought
of
the
possibility
of
thomas
finch
with
his
stolidly
monotonous
voice
being
called
upon
to
read
the
thrilling
lines
recording
the
of
the
turk
to
arms
they
come
the
greek
the
greek
but
thomas
by
careful
plodding
had
climbed
to
fourth
place
and
the
danger
lay
in
the
third
verse
will
you
take
this
class
macrae
said
the
master
handing
him
the
book
he
knew
that
the
dominie
was
not
interested
in
the
art
of
reading
beyond
the
point
of
correct
pronunciation
and
hence
he
hoped
the
class
might
get
off
easily
the
dominie
took
the
book
reluctantly
what
he
desired
was
the
class
and
did
not
care
to
be
put
off
with
mere
reading
well
ranald
let
us
hear
you
he
rather
growled
ranald
went
at
his
work
with
quiet
confidence
he
knew
all
the
words
page
marco
bozzaris
at
midnight
in
his
guarded
tent
the
turk
lay
dreaming
of
the
hour
when
greece
her
knee
in
suppliance
bent
should
tremble
at
his
and
so
on
steadily
to
the
end
of
his
verse
next
the
next
was
betsy

the
daughter
of
dan
campbell
of
the
now
betsy
dan
was
very
red
in
hair
and
face
very
shy
and
very
nervous
and
always
on
the
point
of
giggles
it
was
a
trial
to
her
to
read
on
ordinary
days
but
it
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
to
make
matters
worse
sitting
immediately
behind
her
and
sheltered
from
the
eye
of
the
master
sat
jimmie

youngest
brother
jimmie
was
always
on
the
alert
for
mischief
and
ever
ready
to
go
off
into
fits
of
laughter
which
he
managed
to
check
only
by
grabbing
tight
hold
of
his
nose
just
now
he
was
busy
pulling
at
the
strings
of
betsy
dan
apron
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
was
hanging
onto
his
nose
and
swaying
in
paroxysms
of
laughter
very
red
in
the
face

much
for

jimmie
sober
enough
now
and
terrified
at
the
results
of
his
mischief
doing
what
said
the
master
repressing
a
smile
at
jimmie
woebegone
face
that
and
jimmie
touched
gingerly
with
the
point
of
his
finger
the
bows
of
betsy
dan
oh
i
see
you
were
annoying
elizabeth
while
she
was
reading
no
wonder
she
found
it
difficult
now
do
you
think
that
was
very
nice
jimmie
twisted
himself
into
a
semicircle
come
here
james
jimmie
looked
frightened
came
round
the
class
and
up
to
the
master
now
then
continued
the
master
facing
jimmie
round
in
front
of
betsy
dan
who
was
still
using
her
apron
upon
her
eyes
tell
elizabeth
you
are
jimmie
stood
in
an
agony
of
silent
awkwardness
curving
himself
in
varying
directions
are
you
sorry
well
tell
her
jimmie
drew
a
long
breath
and
braced
himself
for
the
ordeal
he
stood
a
moment
or
two
working
his
eyes
up
shyly
from
betsy
dan
shoes
to
her
face
caught
her
glancing
at
him
from
behind
her
apron
and
began
tchik
tchik
tchik
betsy
dan
look
was
too
much
for
the
little
chap
gravity
a
roar
swept
over
the
even
the
grim
dominie
face
relaxed
go
to
your
seat
and
behave
yourself
said
the
master
giving
jimmie
a
slight
cuff
now
margaret
let
us
go
margaret
was
the
difficult
verse
but
to
margaret
quiet
voice
and
gentle
heart
anything
like
shriek
or
was
foreign
enough
so
with
even
tone
and
unmodulated
by
any
shade
of
passion
she
read
the
cry
to
arms
they
come
the
greek
the
greek
nor
was
her
voice
to
be
moved
from
its
gentle
monotonous
flow
even
by
the
of
bozzaris
strike
till
the
last
armed
foe
expires
next
said
the
dominie
glad
to
get
on
with
his
task
the
master
breathed
freely
when
alas
for
his
hopes
the
minister
spoke
up
but
margaret
do
you
think
bozzaris
cheered
his
men
in
so
gentle
a
voice
as
that
margaret
smiled
sweetly
but
remained
silent
glad
to
get
over
the
verse
would
you
like
to
try
it
again
suggested
the
minister
margaret
flushed
up
at
once
oh
no
said
his
wife
who
had
noticed
margaret
flushing
face
girls
are
not
supposed
to
be
soldiers
are
they
margaret
margaret
flashed
a
grateful
look
at
her
that
a
boy
ay
that
it
is
said
the
old
dominie
and
i
would
wish
very
much
that
murray
would
conduct
this
but
the
minister
wife
would
not
hear
of
it
protesting
that
the
dominie
could
do
it
much
better
the
old
man
however
insisted
saying
that
he
had
no
great
liking
for
this
part
of
the
examination
and
would
wish
to
reserve
himself
with
the
master
permission
for
the
class
murray
seeing
that
it
would
please
the
dominie
took
the
book
with
a
spot
of
color
coming
in
her
delicate
face
you
must
all
do
your
best
now
to
help
me
she
said
with
a
smile
that
brought
an
answering
smile
flashing
along
the
line
even
thomas
finch
allowed
his
stolid
face
a
gleam
of
intelligent
sympathy
which
however
he
immediately
suppressed
for
he
remembered
that
the
next
turn
was
his
and
that
he
must
be
getting
himself
into
the
appearance
of
dogged
desperation
which
he
considered
suitable
to
a
reading
exercise
now
thomas
said
the
minister
wife
sweetly
and
thomas
plunged
heavily
they
fought
like
brave
men
long
oh
thomas
i
think
we
will
try
that
man
verse
again
with
the
cries
of
battle
in
it
you
know
i
am
sure
you
can
do
that
it
was
all
the
same
to
thomas
there
were
no
words
he
could
not
spell
and
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
that
verse
as
well
as
any
other
so
with
an
extra
knitting
of
his
eyebrows
he
set
forth
doggedly
thomas
voice
fell
with
the
unvarying
regularity
of
the
beat
of
a
but
thomas
wait
a
minute
you
see
you
must
speak
these
words
arms
they
come
differently
from
the
others
these
words
were
shrieked
by
the
sentries
and
you
must
show
that
in
your
speak
them
out
man
said
the
minister
sharply
and
a
little
nervously
fearing
that
his
wife
had
undertaken
too
great
a
task
and
hating
to
see
her
defeated
now
thomas
said
murray
try
again
and
remember
the
sentries
shrieked
these
words
arms
and
so
thomas
squared
his
shoulders
spread
his
feet
apart
added
a
wrinkle
to
his
frown
and
a
deeper
note
of
desperation
to
his
tone
and
began
again
the
master
shuddered
now
thomas
excuse
me
that
better
but
we
can
improve
that
murray
was
not
to
be
beaten
the
attention
of
the
whole
school
even
to
jimmie
cameron
as
well
as
that
of
the
visitors
was
now
concentrated
upon
the
event
see
she
went
on
each
phrase
by
itself
hour
passed
on
the
turk
awoke
now
try
that
again
thomas
tried
this
time
with
complete
success
the
visitors
applauded
ah
that
it
thomas
i
was
sure
you
could
do
thomas
relaxed
a
little
but
not
unduly
he
was
not
sure
what
was
yet
before
him
now
we
will
get
that
shriek
see
thomas
like
this
a
little
and
she
read
the
words
with
fine
expression
you
must
put
more
pith
more
force
into
those
words
thomas
speak
out
man
interjected
the
minister
who
was
wishing
it
was
all
over
now
thomas
i
think
this
will
be
the
last
time
you
have
done
very
well
but
i
feel
sure
you
can
do
the
minister
wife
looked
at
thomas
as
she
said
this
with
so
fascinating
a
smile
that
the
frown
on
thomas
face
deepened
into
a
hideous
scowl
and
he
planted
himself
with
a
expression
in
every
angle
of
his
solid
frame
realizing
the
extreme
necessity
of
the
moment
he
pitched
his
voice
several
tones
higher
than
ever
before
in
his
life
inside
a
house
and
before
people
and
made
his
final
attempt
and
now
feeling
that
the
crisis
was
upon
him
and
confusing
speed
with
intensity
and
sound
with
passion
he
rushed
his
words
with
speed
into
a
wild
yell
there
was
a
moment
of
startled
stillness
then
tchik
tchik
it
was
jimmie
again
holding
his
nose
and
swaying
in
a
vain
effort
to
control
a
paroxysm
of
snickers
at
thomas
unusual
outburst
it
was
like
a
match
to
powder
again
the
whole
school
burst
into
a
roar
of
uncontrollable
laughter
even
the
minister
the
master
and
the
dominie
could
not
resist
the
only
faces
unmoved
were
those
of
thomas
finch
and
the
minister
wife
he
had
tried
his
best
and
it
was
to
please
her
and
she
knew
it
a
swift
shamed
glance
round
and
his
eyes
rested
on
her
face
that
face
was
sweet
and
grave
as
she
leaned
toward
him
and
said
thank
you
thomas
that
was
well
and
thomas
still
looking
at
her
flushed
to
his
hair
roots
and
down
the
back
of
his
neck
while
the
scowl
on
his
forehead
faded
into
a
frown
and
then
into
smoothness
and
if
you
always
try
your
best
like
that
thomas
you
will
be
a
great
and
good
man
some
her
voice
was
low
and
soft
as
if
intended
for
him
alone
but
in
the
sudden
silence
that
followed
the
laughter
it
thrilled
to
every
heart
in
the
room
and
thomas
was
surprised
to
find
himself
trying
to
swallow
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
to
keep
his
eyes
from
blinking
and
in
his
face
stolid
and
heavy
a
new
expression
was
struggling
for
utterance
here
take
me
it
said
all
that
i
have
is
thine
and
later
days
brought
the
opportunity
to
prove
it
the
rest
of
the
reading
lesson
passed
without
incident
indeed
there
pervaded
the
whole
school
that
feeling
of
reaction
which
always
succeeds
an
emotional
climax
the
master
decided
to
omit
the
geography
and
grammar
classes
which
should
have
immediately
followed
and
have
dinner
at
once
and
so
allow
both
children
and
visitors
time
to
recover
tone
for
the
spelling
and
arithmetic
of
the
afternoon
the
dinner
was
an
elaborate
and
appalling
variety
of
pies
and
cakes
served
by
the
big
girls
and
their
sisters
who
had
recently
left
school
and
who
consequently
bore
themselves
with
all
proper
dignity
and
importance
two
of
the
boys
passed
round
a
pail
of
water
and
a
tin
cup
that
all
the
thirsty
might
drink
from
hand
to
hand
and
from
lip
to
lip
the
cup
passed
with
a
fine
contempt
of
microbes
the
only
point
of
etiquette
insisted
upon
was
that
no
leavings
should
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
cup
or
thrown
back
into
the
pail
but
should
be
carefully
flung
upon
the
floor
there
had
been
examination
feasts
in
days
in
the
twentieth
school
when
the
boys
indulged
in
free
fights
at
long
range
using
as
missiles
remnants
of
pie
crust
and
cake
whose
consistency
rendered
them
deadly
enough
to
bloody
a
nose
or
black
an
eye
but
these
barbaric
encounters
ceased
with
archie
munro
advent
and
now
the
boys
vied
with
each
other
in
minding
their
not
only
was
there
no
snatching
of
food
or
exhibition
of
greediness
but
there
was
a
severe
repression
of
any
apparent
eagerness
for
the
tempting
dainties
lest
it
should
be
suspected
that
such
were
unusual
at
home
even
the
little
boys
felt
that
it
would
be
bad
manners
to
take
a
second
piece
of
cake
or
pie
unless
specially
pressed
but
their
eager
bulging
eyes
revealed
only
too
plainly
their
heart
desire
and
the
kindly
waiters
knew
their
duty
sufficiently
to
urge
a
second
third
and
fourth
supply
of
the
toothsome
currant
or
berry
pie
the
solid
fruit
cake
or
the
oily
doughnut
till
the
point
was
reached
where
desire
failed
have
some
more
jimmie
have
a
doughnut
said
the
master
who
had
been
admiring
jimmie
gastronomic
achievements
he
had
ten
shouted
little
aleck
sinclair
jimmie
special
confidant
jimmie
smiled
in
conscious
pride
but
remained
silent
what
eaten
ten
doughnuts
asked
the
master
feigning
alarm
he
got
four
in
his
pocket
too
said
aleck
in
triumph
he
got
a
pie
in
his
own
pocket
retorted
jimmie
driven
to
retaliate
a
pie
exclaimed
the
master
better
take
it
out
a
pocket
not
the
best
place
for
a
pie
why
do
you
eat
it
aleck
i
ca
lamented
aleck
i
full
he
said
he
nearly
busted
said
jimmie
anxiously
he
got
a
pain
here
pointing
to
his
left
eye
the
bigger
boys
and
some
of
the
visitors
who
had
gathered
round
shouted
with
laughter
oh
pshaw
aleck
said
the
master
encouragingly
that
all
right
as
long
as
the
pain
is
as
high
up
as
your
eye
you
recover
i
tell
you
what
put
your
pie
down
on
the
desk
here
jimmie
will
take
care
of
it
and
run
down
to
the
gate
and
tell
don
i
want
aleck
with
great
care
and
considerable
difficulty
extracted
from
his
pocket
a
segment
of
black
currant
pie
hopelessly
battered
but
still
intact
he
regarded
it
fondly
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
with
a
very
dubious
look
at
jimmie
ran
away
on
his
errand
for
the
master
it
took
him
some
little
time
to
find
don
and
meanwhile
the
attention
was
drawn
away
by
his
duty
to
the
visitors
the
pie
left
to
jimmie
care
had
an
unfortunately
tempting
fringe
of
loose
pieces
about
it
that
marred
its
symmetry
jimmie
proceeded
to
trim
it
into
shape
so
absorbed
did
he
become
in
this
trimming
process
that
before
he
realized
what
he
was
about
he
woke
suddenly
to
the
startling
fact
that
the
pie
had
shrunk
into
a
comparatively
insignificant
size
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
to
save
the
mutilated
remains
for
aleck
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
get
the
reproachful
remnant
out
of
the
way
he
was
so
busily
occupied
with
this
praiseworthy
proceeding
that
he
failed
to
notice
aleck
enter
the
room
flushed
with
his
race
eager
and
once
more
empty
arriving
at
his
seat
he
came
upon
jimmie
engaged
in
devouring
the
pie
left
in
his
charge
with
a
cry
of
dismay
and
rage
he
flung
himself
upon
the
little
gourmand
and
after
a
short
struggle
secured
the
precious
pie
but
alas
bereft
of
its
most
delicious
part
it
was
picked
clean
of
its
currants
for
a
moment
he
gazed
at
the
leathery
viscous
remnant
in
his
hand
then
with
a
wrathful
exclamation
here
then
you
can
just
take
it
then
you
big
pig
you
he
seized
jimmie
by
the
neck
and
jammed
the
sticky
pie
crust
on
his
face
where
it
stuck
like
an
adhesive
plaster
jimmie
taken
by
surprise
and
rendered
nerveless
by
the
pangs
of
an
accusing
conscience
made
no
resistance
but
set
up
a
howl
that
attracted
the
attention
of
the
master
and
the
whole
company
why
jimmie
exclaimed
the
master
removing
the
doughy
mixture
from
the
little
lad
face
what
on
earth
are
you
trying
to
do
what
is
wrong
aleck
he
ate
my
pie
said
aleck
defiantly
ate
it
well
apparently
not
but
never
mind
aleck
we
shall
get
you
another
there
is
any
more
said
aleck
mournfully
that
was
the
last
oh
well
we
shall
find
something
else
just
as
good
said
the
master
going
off
after
one
of
the
big
girls
and
returning
with
a
doughnut
and
a
peculiarly
deadly
looking
piece
of
fruit
cake
he
succeeded
in
comforting
the
disappointed
and
still
indignant
aleck
the
afternoon
was
given
to
the
more
serious
part
of
the
school
work
writing
arithmetic
and
spelling
while
for
those
whose
ambitions
extended
beyond
the
limits
of
the
public
school
the
master
had
begun
a
euclid
class
which
was
at
once
his
despair
and
his
pride
in
the
twentieth
school
of
that
date
there
was
no
waste
of
the
children
time
in
foolish
and
fantastic
branches
of
study
in
showy
exercises
and
accomplishments
whose
display
was
at
once
ruinous
to
the
nerves
of
the
visitors
and
to
the
and
modesty
of
the
children
the
ideal
of
the
school
was
to
fit
the
children
for
the
struggle
into
which
their
lives
would
thrust
them
so
that
the
boy
who
could
spell
and
read
and
cipher
was
supposed
to
be
ready
for
his
life
work
those
whose
ambition
led
them
into
the
subtleties
of
problems
and
theorems
were
supposed
to
be
in
preparation
for
somewhat
higher
spheres
of
life
through
the
various
classes
of
arithmetic
the
examination
proceeded
the
little
ones
struggling
with
great
seriousness
through
their
addition
and
subtraction
sums
and
being
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
by
their
contest
for
the
first
place
by
the
time
the
fifth
class
was
reached
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
feeling
of
battle
indeed
it
was
amazing
to
note
how
the
master
had
succeeded
in
arousing
in
the
whole
school
an
intense
spirit
of
emulation
from
little
johnnie
aird
up
to
thomas
finch
the
pupils
carried
the
hearts
of
soldiers
through
fractions
the
rule
of
three
percentages
and
stocks
the
senior
class
swept
with
a
trail
of
glory
in
vain
old
peter
macrae
strewed
their
path
with
his
favorite
posers
the
brilliant
achievements
of
the
class
seemed
to
sink
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
gloom
of
discontent
while
the
master
the
minister
and
his
wife
as
well
as
the
visitors
could
not
conceal
their
delight
as
a
last
resort
the
old
dominie
sought
to
stem
their
victorious
career
with
his
famous
problem
in
practice
and
to
his
huge
enjoyment
one
after
another
of
the
class
had
to
acknowledge
defeat
the
truth
was
the
master
had
passed
lightly
over
this
rule
in
the
arithmetic
considering
the
solution
of
problems
by
the
method
of
practice
as
a
little
antiquated
and
hardly
worthy
of
much
study
the
failure
of
the
class
however
brought
the
dominie
his
hour
of
triumph
and
so
complete
had
been
the
success
of
the
examination
that
the
master
was
abundantly
willing
that
he
should
enjoy
it
then
followed
the
judging
of
the
the
best
and
cleanest
book
in
each
class
was
given
the
proud
distinction
of
a
testimonial
written
upon
the
first
blank
page
with
the
date
of
the
examination
and
the
signatures
of
the
examiners
attached
it
was
afterwards
borne
home
in
triumph
by
the
happy
owner
to
be
stored
among
the
family
archives
and
perhaps
among
the
sacred
things
that
mothers
keep
in
their
holy
of
holies
after
the
had
been
duly
appraised
there
followed
an
hour
in
which
the
excitement
of
the
day
reached
its
highest
mark
the
whole
school
with
such
of
the
visitors
as
could
be
persuaded
to
join
were
ranged
in
opposing
ranks
in
the
deadly
conflict
of
a
the
master
the
teacher
from
the
sixteenth
and
even
the
minister
wife
yielded
to
the
tremendous
pressure
of
public
demand
that
they
should
enter
the
fray
the
contest
had
a
most
dramatic
finish
and
it
was
felt
that
the
extreme
possibility
of
enthusiasm
and
excitement
was
reached
when
the
minister
wife
spelled
down
the
teacher
from
the
sixteenth
who
every
one
knew
was
the
champion
speller
of
all
the
country
that
lay
toward
the
front
and
had
a
special
private
armory
of
deadly
missiles
laid
up
against
just
such
a
conflict
as
this
the
tumultuous
triumph
of
the
children
was
not
to
be
controlled
again
and
again
they
followed
hughie
in
wild
yells
not
only
because
his
mother
was
a
great
favorite
with
them
all
but
because
she
had
wrested
a
victory
from
the
champion
of
the
front
for
the
front
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
culture
and
fashion
thought
itself
quite
superior
to
the
more
backwoods
country
of
the
twentieth
it
was
with
no
small
difficulty
that
the
master
brought
the
school
to
such
a
degree
of
order
that
the
closing
speeches
could
be
received
with
becoming
respect
and
attention
the
trustees
according
to
custom
were
invited
to
express
their
opinion
upon
the
examination
and
upon
school
matters
generally
the
chairman
john
cameron
long
john
as
he
was
called
broke
the
ice
after
much
persuasion
and
slowly
rising
from
the
desk
into
which
he
had
compressed
his
long
lank
form
he
made
his
speech
long
john
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
master
but
for
all
that
and
perhaps
because
of
that
he
allowed
himself
no
warmer
words
of
commendation
than
that
he
was
well
pleased
with
the
way
in
which
the
children
had
conducted
themselves
they
have
done
credit
to
themselves
he
said
and
to
their
teacher
and
indeed
i
am
sorry
he
is
leaving
us
for
so
far
i
have
heard
no
complaints
in
the
the
other
trustees
followed
in
the
path
thus
blazed
out
for
them
by
long
john
they
were
all
well
pleased
with
the
examination
and
they
were
all
sorry
to
lose
the
master
and
they
had
heard
no
complaints
it
was
perfectly
understood
that
no
words
of
praise
could
add
to
the
high
testimony
that
they
had
heard
no
the
dominie
speech
was
a
little
more
elaborate
somewhat
reluctantly
he
acknowledged
that
the
school
had
acquitted
itself
with
very
considerable
credit
especially
the
class
and
indeed
considering
all
the
circumstances
munro
was
to
be
congratulated
upon
the
results
of
his
work
in
the
section
but
the
minister
warm
expression
of
delight
at
the
day
proceedings
and
of
regret
at
the
departure
of
the
master
more
than
atoned
for
the
trustees
cautious
testimony
and
the
dominie
somewhat
grudging
praise
then
came
the
moment
of
the
day
a
great
stillness
fell
upon
the
school
as
the
master
rose
to
make
his
farewell
speech
but
before
he
could
say
a
word
up
from
their
seats
walked
betsy
dan
and
thomas
finch
and
ranged
themselves
before
him
the
whole
assemblage
tingled
with
suppressed
excitement
the
great
secret
with
which
they
had
been
burdening
themselves
for
the
past
few
weeks
was
now
to
be
out
slowly
thomas
extracted
the
manuscript
from
his
trousers
pocket
and
smoothed
out
its
many
folds
while
betsy
dan
waited
nervously
in
the
rear
oh
why
did
they
set
thomas
to
this
whispered
the
minister
wife
who
had
a
profound
sense
of
humor
the
truth
was
the
choice
of
the
school
had
fallen
upon
ranald
and
margaret
aird
margaret
was
quite
willing
to
act
but
ranald
refused
and
privately
persuaded
thomas
to
accept
the
honor
in
his
stead
to
this
thomas
agreed
all
the
more
readily
that
margaret
whom
he
adored
from
a
respectful
distance
was
to
be
his
partner
but
margaret
who
would
gladly
have
been
associated
with
ranald
on
the
suggestion
that
thomas
should
take
his
place
put
up
her
lower
lip
in
that
symbol
of
scorn
so
effective
with
girls
but
which
no
boy
has
ever
yet
accomplished
and
declared
that
indeed
and
she
would
see
that
tom
finch
far
enough
which
plainly
meant
consequently
they
had
to
fall
back
upon
betsy
dan
who
in
addition
to
being
excessively
nervous
was
extremely
and
thomas
though
he
would
greatly
have
preferred
margaret
as
his
assistant
was
quite
ready
to
accept
betsy
dan
the
interval
of
waiting
while
thomas
deliberately
smoothed
out
the
creases
of
the
paper
was
exceedingly
hard
upon
betsy
dan
whose
face
grew
redder
each
moment
jimmie
cameron
too
who
realized
that
the
occasion
was
one
of
unusual
solemnity
was
gazing
at
thomas
with
intense
interest
growing
into
amusement
and
was
holding
his
fingers
in
readiness
to
seize
his
nose
and
so
check
any
explosion
of
snickers
just
as
thomas
had
got
the
last
fold
of
his
paper
straightened
out
and
was
turning
it
right
end
up
it
somehow
slipped
through
his
fingers
to
the
floor
this
was
too
much
for
jimmie
who
only
saved
himself
from
utter
disgrace
by
promptly
seizing
his
nose
and
holding
on
for
dear
life
thomas
gave
jimmie
a
passing
glare
and
straightened
himself
up
for
his
work
with
a
furious
frown
he
cleared
his
throat
and
began
in
a
solemn
roar
dear
teacher
learning
with
regret
that
you
are
about
to
sever
your
connection
etc
all
went
well
until
he
came
to
the
words
we
beg
you
to
accept
this
gift
not
for
its
intrinsic
value
which
was
the
cue
for
betsy
dan
but
betsy
dan
was
engaged
in
terrorizing
jimmie
and
failed
to
come
in
till
after
an
awful
pause
thomas
gave
her
a
sharp
nudge
and
whispered
audibly
give
it
to
him
you
poor
betsy
dan
in
sudden
confusion
whipped
her
hand
out
from
under
her
apron
and
thrusting
a
box
at
the
master
said
hurriedly
here
it
is
as
thomas
solemnly
concluded
his
address
a
smile
ran
round
the
room
while
jimmie
doubled
himself
up
in
his
efforts
to
suppress
a
tempest
of
snickers
the
master
however
seemed
to
see
nothing
humorous
in
the
situation
but
bowing
gravely
to
thomas
and
betsy
dan
he
said
kindly
thank
you
thomas
thank
you
elizabeth
something
in
his
tone
brought
the
school
to
attention
and
even
jimmie
forgot
to
have
regard
to
his
nose
for
a
few
moments
the
master
stood
looking
upon
the
faces
of
his
pupils
dwelling
upon
them
one
by
one
till
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
wee
tots
in
the
front
seat
looking
at
him
with
eyes
of
innocent
and
serious
wonder
then
he
thanked
the
children
for
their
gift
in
a
few
simple
words
assuring
them
that
he
should
always
wear
the
watch
with
pride
and
grateful
remembrance
of
the
twentieth
school
and
of
his
happy
days
among
them
but
when
he
came
to
say
his
words
of
farewell
and
to
thank
them
for
their
goodness
to
him
and
their
loyal
backing
of
him
while
he
was
their
teacher
his
voice
grew
husky
and
for
a
moment
wavered
then
after
a
pause
he
spoke
of
what
had
been
his
ideal
among
them
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
your
minds
trained
and
stored
with
useful
knowledge
but
there
are
better
things
than
that
to
learn
honor
truth
and
right
to
be
manly
and
womanly
to
be
and
brave
and
gentle
these
are
better
than
all
possible
stores
of
learning
and
if
i
have
taught
you
these
at
all
then
i
have
done
what
i
most
wished
to
do
i
have
often
failed
and
i
have
often
been
discouraged
and
might
have
given
up
were
it
not
for
the
help
i
received
at
my
worst
times
from
our
minister
and
from
murray
who
often
saved
me
from
a
sudden
flush
tinged
the
grave
beautiful
face
of
the
minister
young
wife
a
light
filled
her
eyes
as
the
master
said
these
words
for
she
remembered
days
when
the
young
man
pain
was
almost
greater
than
he
could
bear
and
when
he
was
near
to
giving
up
when
the
master
ceased
the
minister
spoke
a
few
words
in
appreciation
of
the
work
he
had
done
in
the
school
and
in
the
whole
section
during
his
three
years
stay
among
them
and
expressed
his
conviction
that
many
a
young
lad
would
grow
into
a
better
man
because
he
had
known
archibald
munro
and
some
of
them
would
never
forget
what
he
had
done
for
them
by
this
time
all
the
big
girls
and
many
of
the
visitors
were
openly
weeping
the
boys
were
looking
straight
in
front
of
them
their
faces
set
in
an
appearance
of
savage
gloom
for
they
knew
well
how
near
they
were
to
acting
like
the
after
a
short
prayer
by
the
minister
the
children
filed
out
past
the
master
who
stood
at
the
door
and
shook
hands
with
them
one
by
one
when
the
big
boys
and
the
young
men
who
had
gone
to
school
in
the
winter
months
came
to
say
good
by
they
shook
hands
silently
and
then
stood
close
about
him
as
if
hating
to
let
him
go
he
had
caught
for
them
in
many
a
close
match
he
had
saved
their
goal
in
many
a
fierce
shinny
fight
with
the
front
and
while
he
had
ruled
them
with
an
iron
rule
he
had
always
treated
them
fairly
he
had
never
failed
them
he
had
never
weakened
he
had
always
been
a
man
among
them
no
wonder
they
stood
close
about
him
and
hated
to
lose
him
suddenly
big
bob
fraser
called
out
in
a
husky
voice
three
cheers
for
the
captain
and
every
one
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
let
himself
out
in
a
roar
and
that
was
the
last
of
the
farewells
chapter
iv
the
new
master
right
in
front
of
the
school
door
and
some
little
distance
from
it
in
the
midst
of
a
clump
of
maples
stood
an
old
with
a
dead
top
and
down
where
a
limb
had
once
been
and
had
rotted
off
a
hole
inside
this
hole
two
very
respectable
but
thoroughly
impudent
red
squirrels
had
made
their
nest
the
hole
led
into
the
dead
heart
of
the
tree
which
had
been
hollowed
out
with
pains
so
as
to
make
a
roomy
cosy
home
which
the
squirrels
had
lined
with
fur
and
moss
and
which
was
well
stored
with
beechnuts
from
the
tree
their
winter
provisions
between
the
boys
and
the
squirrels
there
existed
an
armed
neutrality
it
was
understood
among
the
boys
that
nothing
worse
than
snowballs
was
to
be
used
in
their
war
with
the
squirrels
while
with
the
squirrels
it
was
a
matter
of
honor
that
they
should
put
reasonable
limits
to
their
profanity
but
there
were
times
when
the
relations
became
strained
and
hence
the
holidays
were
no
less
welcome
to
the
squirrels
than
to
the
boys
to
the
squirrels
this
had
been
a
day
of
unusual
anxiety
for
the
school
had
taken
up
again
after
its
two
weeks
holidays
and
the
boys
were
a
little
more
inquisitive
than
usual
and
unfortunately
the
snow
happened
to
be
good
for
packing
it
had
been
a
bad
day
for
nerves
and
bushy
as
the
boys
called
him
found
it
impossible
to
keep
his
tail
in
one
position
for
more
than
one
second
at
a
time
it
was
in
vain
that
his
more
sedate
and
partner
in
life
remonstrated
with
him
and
urged
a
more
philosophic
mind
it
all
very
well
for
you
my
dear
bushy
was
saying
rather
crossly
i
am
afraid
to
urge
a
philosophic
mind
but
if
you
had
the
responsibility
of
the
family
upon
you
goodness
gracious
owls
and
weasels
what
in
all
the
woods
is
that
ca
be
the
wolves
said
bushy
placidly
it
too
early
for
might
have
known
replied
her
husband
quite
crossly
of
course
those
boys
i
wonder
why
they
let
them
out
of
school
at
all
why
they
keep
them
in
where
it
is
warm
it
always
seems
to
me
a
very
silly
thing
anyway
for
them
to
keep
rushing
out
of
their
hole
in
that
stupid
fashion
what
they
do
in
there
i
am
sure
i
do
know
it
is
the
least
like
a
nest
i
seen
inside
of
it
there
is
a
thing
to
eat
nor
a
bit
of
hair
or
moss
they
just
go
in
and
out
well
my
dear
said
his
wife
soothingly
you
can
hardly
expect
them
to
know
as
much
as
people
with
a
wider
outlook
we
must
remember
they
are
only
ground
that
just
it
grumbled
bushy
i
only
wish
they
would
just
keep
to
themselves
and
on
the
ground
where
they
belong
but
they
have
the
impudence
to
come
lumbering
up
here
into
our
oh
well
replied
his
partner
calmly
you
must
acknowledge
they
do
not
disturb
our
and
a
good
thing
for
them
too
chattered
bushy
fiercely
smoothing
out
his
whiskers
and
showing
his
sharp
front
teeth
at
which
bushy
smiled
gently
behind
her
tail
but
what
are
they
doing
now
she
inquired
oh
they
are
going
off
into
the
woods
said
bushy
who
had
issued
from
his
hole
and
was
sitting
up
on
a
convenient
crotch
and
i
declare
he
said
in
amazed
tones
they
have
thrown
one
snowball
at
me
something
must
be
badly
wrong
with
them
wonder
what
it
is
this
is
quite
at
this
bushy
ventured
carefully
out
to
observe
the
extraordinary
phenomenon
for
the
boys
were
actually
making
their
way
to
the
gate
the
smaller
ones
with
much
noisy
shouting
but
the
big
boys
soberly
enough
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
it
was
their
first
day
of
the
new
master
and
such
a
day
as
quite
flabbergastrated
as
don
cameron
said
even
the
oldest
of
them
but
of
course
and
bushy
knew
nothing
of
this
and
could
only
marvel
murdie
cried
hughie
to
don
big
brother
who
with
bob
fraser
ranald
macdonald
and
thomas
finch
was
walking
slowly
toward
the
gate
you
wo
forget
to
ask
your
pa
for
an
excuse
if
you
happen
to
be
late
will
you
murdie
paid
no
attention
you
wo
forget
your
excuse
murdie
continued
hughie
poking
him
in
the
back
murdie
suddenly
turned
caught
him
by
the
neck
and
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
threw
him
head
first
into
a
drift
from
which
he
emerged
wrathful
and
sputtering
well
i
hope
you
do
continued
hughie
and
then
you
catch
it
and
mind
you
he
went
on
circling
round
to
get
in
front
of
him
if
you
want
to
ask
big
bob
there
for
his
knife
mind
you
hold
up
your
hand
murdie
only
grinned
at
him
the
new
master
had
begun
the
day
by
enunciating
the
regulations
under
which
the
school
was
to
be
administered
they
made
rather
a
formidable
list
but
two
of
them
seemed
to
the
boys
to
have
gone
beyond
the
limits
of
all
that
was
outrageous
and
absurd
there
was
to
be
no
speaking
during
school
hours
and
if
a
boy
should
desire
to
ask
a
question
of
his
neighbor
he
was
to
hold
up
his
hand
and
get
permission
from
the
master
but
worse
than
all
and
more
absurd
than
all
was
the
regulation
that
all
late
comers
and
absentees
were
to
bring
written
excuses
from
parents
or
guardians
guardian
thomas
finch
had
grunted
what
that
your
grandmother
whispered
don
back
it
was
not
don
reply
that
brought
thomas
into
disgrace
this
first
day
of
the
new
master
rule
it
was
the
vision
of
big
murdie
cameron
walking
up
to
the
desk
with
an
excuse
for
lateness
which
he
had
obtained
from
long
john
his
father
this
vision
breaking
suddenly
in
upon
the
solemnity
of
thomas
finch
mind
had
sent
him
into
a
snort
of
laughter
not
more
to
the
surprise
of
the
school
than
of
himself
the
gravity
of
the
school
had
not
been
greatly
helped
by
thomas
sheepish
answer
to
the
master
indignant
question
what
did
you
do
that
for
sir
i
did
it
did
on
the
whole
the
opening
day
had
not
been
a
success
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
almost
too
much
to
expect
that
it
should
be
anything
but
a
failure
there
was
a
kind
of
settled
if
unspoken
opinion
among
the
children
that
no
master
could
ever
fill
archibald
munro
place
in
the
school
indeed
it
was
felt
to
be
a
kind
of
impertinence
for
any
man
to
attempt
such
a
thing
and
further
there
was
a
secret
sentiment
among
the
boys
that
loyalty
to
the
old
master
memory
demanded
an
attitude
of
unsympathetic
opposition
to
the
one
who
came
to
take
his
place
it
did
not
help
the
situation
that
the
new
master
was
unaware
of
this
state
of
mind
he
was
buoyed
up
by
the
sentiments
of
enthusiastic
admiration
and
approval
that
he
carried
with
him
in
the
testimonials
from
his
last
board
of
trustees
in
town
with
which
sentiments
he
fully
agreed
and
hence
he
greeted
the
pupils
of
the
little
backwoods
school
with
an
airy
condescension
that
reduced
the
school
to
a
condition
of
speechless
and
indignant
astonishment
the
school
was
prepared
to
tolerate
the
man
who
should
presume
to
succeed
their
former
master
if
sufficiently
humble
but
certainly
not
to
accept
airy
condescension
from
him
does
he
think
we
babies
asked
don
indignantly
and
did
you
see
him
trying
to
chop
at
recess
hughie
called
it
he
could
hit
twice
in
the
same
and
he
asked
me
if
that
beech
there
was
a
maple
said
bob
fraser
in
deep
disgust
oh
shut
up
your
gab
said
ranald
suddenly
give
the
man
a
chance
will
you
bring
an
excuse
when
you
absent
ranald
asked
hughie
and
where
would
i
be
getting
it
asked
ranald
grimly
and
all
the
boys
realized
the
absurdity
of
expecting
a
written
excuse
for
absence
from
his
father
macdonald
dubh
was
not
a
man
to
be
bothered
with
such
trifles
you
might
get
it
from
your
aunt
kirsty
ranald
said
don
slyly
the
boys
shouted
at
the
suggestion
and
she
could
do
it
well
enough
if
it
would
be
necessary
said
ranald
facing
square
round
on
don
and
throwing
up
his
head
after
his
manner
when
battle
was
in
the
air
while
the
red
blood
showed
in
his
dark
cheek
and
his
eyes
lit
up
with
a
fierce
gleam
don
read
the
danger
signal
i
not
saying
she
could
he
hurried
to
say
apologetically
but
it
would
be
funny
would
it
well
said
ranald
relenting
and
smiling
a
little
it
would
be
keeping
her
busy
at
when
the
deer
are
running
eh
ranald
said
murdie
but
ranald
right
boys
he
continued
give
the
man
a
chance
say
there
our
bells
cried
thomas
finch
as
the
deep
musical
boom
of
the
finch
came
through
the
bush
come
on
hughie
get
them
at
the
and
followed
by
hughie
and
the
boys
from
the
north
he
set
off
for
the
north
where
they
would
meet
the
finch
coming
empty
from
the
to
the
great
surprise
and
unalloyed
delight
of
and
bushy
who
from
their
crotch
in
the
old
beech
had
watched
with
some
anxiety
the
boys
unusual
conduct
there
they
are
hughie
called
thomas
as
the
sleighs
came
out
into
the
open
at
the
crossroads
they
wait
for
us
they
know
coming
he
yelled
encouragingly
for
the
big
boys
had
left
the
smaller
ones
a
panting
train
far
in
the
rear
and
were
piling
themselves
upon
the
finch
sleighs
with
never
a
by
your
leave
to
william
john
familiarly
known
as
billy
jack
thomas
eldest
brother
who
drove
the
finch
team
thomas
home
lay
a
mile
north
and
another
east
from
the
twentieth
but
the
winter
road
by
which
they
hauled
to
the
mill
cut
right
through
the
forest
where
the
deep
snow
packed
hard
into
a
smooth
track
covering
roots
and
logs
and
mud
holes
and
making
a
perfect
surface
for
the
sleighs
however
heavily
loaded
except
where
here
and
there
the
or
cahots
came
these
cahots
by
the
way
though
they
became
especially
toward
the
spring
a
serious
annoyance
to
teamsters
only
added
another
to
the
delights
that
a
held
for
the
boys
to
hughie
the
ride
this
evening
was
blissful
to
an
unspeakable
degree
he
was
overflowing
with
new
sensations
he
was
going
to
spend
the
night
with
thomas
for
one
thing
and
thomas
as
his
host
was
quite
a
new
and
different
person
from
the
thomas
of
the
school
the
minister
wife
ever
since
the
examination
day
had
taken
a
deeper
interest
in
thomas
and
determined
that
something
should
be
made
out
of
the
solemn
stolid
boy
partly
for
this
reason
she
had
yielded
to
eager
pleading
backing
up
the
invitation
brought
by
thomas
himself
and
delivered
in
an
agony
of
confusion
that
hughie
should
be
allowed
to
go
home
with
him
for
the
night
partly
too
because
she
was
glad
that
hughie
should
see
something
of
the
finch
home
and
especially
of
the
little
woman
who
so
silently
and
unobtrusively
but
so
efficiently
administered
her
home
her
family
and
their
affairs
and
especially
her
husband
without
suspicion
on
his
part
that
anything
of
the
kind
was
being
done
in
addition
to
the
joy
that
hughie
had
in
thomas
in
his
new
role
as
host
this
winter
road
was
full
of
wonder
and
delight
as
were
all
roads
and
paths
that
wound
right
through
the
heart
of
the
bush
the
regular
roads
with
the
forest
cut
back
beyond
the
ditches
at
the
sides
were
a
great
weariness
to
hughie
except
indeed
in
the
springtime
when
these
ditches
were
running
full
with
water
over
the
mottled
clay
bottom
and
gravelly
ripples
but
the
bush
roads
and
paths
summer
and
winter
were
filled
with
things
of
wonder
and
of
beauty
and
this
particular
winter
road
of
the
finch
was
best
of
all
to
hughie
for
it
was
quite
new
to
him
and
besides
it
led
right
through
the
mysterious
big
pine
swamp
and
over
the
butternut
ridge
beyond
which
lay
the
finch
farm
tamarack
spruce
and
cedar
made
up
the
thick
underbrush
of
the
pine
swamp
white
birch
white
ash
and
black
were
thickly
sprinkled
through
it
but
high
above
these
lesser
trees
towered
the
white
pines
lifting
their
great
tufted
crests
in
lonely
grandeur
seeming
like
kings
among
meaner
men
here
and
there
the
rabbit
runways
packed
into
hard
little
paths
crossed
the
road
and
disappeared
under
the
thick
spruces
and
balsams
here
and
there
the
sly
single
track
of
the
fox
or
the
deep
of
the
deer
led
off
into
unknown
depths
on
either
side
hughie
sitting
up
on
the
bolster
of
the
front
bob
beside
billy
jack
for
even
the
big
boys
recognized
his
right
as
thomas
guest
to
that
coveted
place
listened
with
eager
face
and
eyes
to
billy
jack
remarks
upon
the
forest
and
its
strange
people
one
thing
else
added
to
hughie
keen
enjoyment
of
the
ride
billy
jack
bays
were
always
in
the
finest
of
fettle
and
pulled
hard
on
the
lines
and
were
rarely
allowed
the
rapture
of
a
gallop
but
when
the
swamp
was
passed
and
the
road
came
to
the
more
open
butternut
ridge
billy
jack
shook
the
lines
over
their
backs
and
let
them
out
their
response
was
superb
to
witness
and
brought
hughie
some
moments
of
ecstatic
rapture
along
the
road
that
wound
about
among
the
big
butternuts
the
rangey
bays
sped
at
a
flat
gallop
bounding
clear
over
the
cahots
the
booming
of
the
bells
and
the
rattling
of
the
chains
furnishing
an
exhilarating
accompaniment
to
the
swift
swaying
motion
while
the
children
clung
for
dear
life
to
the
and
to
each
other
it
was
all
billy
jack
could
do
to
get
his
team
down
to
a
trot
by
the
time
they
reached
the
clearing
for
there
the
going
was
perilous
and
besides
it
was
just
as
well
that
his
father
should
not
witness
any
signs
on
billy
jack
part
of
the
folly
that
he
was
inclined
to
attribute
to
the
rising
generation
so
steadily
enough
the
bays
trotted
up
the
lane
and
between
long
lines
of
green
cordwood
on
one
side
and
a
on
the
other
into
the
yard
and
swinging
round
the
big
that
faced
the
open
shed
and
was
flanked
on
the
right
by
the
and
and
on
the
left
by
the
came
to
a
full
stop
at
their
own
stable
door
thomas
you
take
hughie
into
the
house
to
get
warm
till
i
unhitch
said
billy
jack
with
the
feeling
that
courtesy
to
the
minister
son
demanded
this
attention
but
hughie
rejecting
this
proposition
with
scorn
pushed
thomas
aside
and
set
himself
to
unhitch
the
on
the
outside
trace
of
the
nigh
bay
it
was
one
of
hughie
grievances
and
a
very
sore
point
with
him
that
his
father
people
would
insist
on
treating
him
in
the
privileged
manner
they
thought
proper
to
his
father
son
and
his
chief
ambition
was
to
stand
upon
his
own
legs
and
to
fare
like
other
boys
so
he
scorned
billy
jack
suggestion
and
while
some
of
the
children
scurried
about
the
stacks
for
a
little
romp
before
setting
off
for
their
homes
which
some
of
them
for
the
sake
of
the
ride
had
left
far
behind
hughie
devoted
himself
to
the
unhitching
of
the
team
with
billy
jack
and
so
quick
was
he
in
his
movements
and
so
fearless
of
the
horses
that
he
had
his
side
unhitched
and
was
struggling
with
the
before
billy
jack
had
finished
with
his
horse
man
you
a
regular
farmer
said
billy
jack
admiringly
only
you
too
quick
for
the
rest
of
hughie
still
struggling
with
the
found
his
heart
swell
with
pride
to
be
a
farmer
was
his
present
dream
but
that
too
heavy
for
you
continued
billy
jack
here
let
down
the
tongue
pshaw
said
hughie
disgusted
at
his
exhibition
of
ignorance
i
knew
that
tongue
ought
to
come
out
first
but
i
oh
well
it
just
as
good
that
way
but
not
quite
so
easy
said
billy
jack
with
doubtful
consistency
it
took
hughie
but
a
few
minutes
after
the
tongue
was
let
down
to
unfasten
his
end
of
the
and
the
and
he
was
beginning
at
his
always
a
difficult
buckle
when
billy
jack
called
out
hold
on
there
you
too
quick
for
me
we
make
them
carry
their
own
harness
into
the
stable
do
believe
in
making
a
horse
of
billy
jack
was
something
of
a
humorist
the
finch
homestead
was
a
model
of
finished
neatness
order
was
its
law
outside
the
stables
barns
stacks
the
very
evidenced
that
law
within
the
house
and
its
belongings
and
affairs
were
perfect
in
their
harmonious
arrangement
the
whole
establishment
without
and
within
gave
token
of
the
unremitting
care
of
one
organizing
mind
for
from
dark
to
dark
while
others
might
have
their
moments
of
rest
and
careless
ease
the
little
mother
as
billy
jack
called
her
was
ever
on
guard
and
all
the
machinery
of
house
and
farm
moved
smoothly
and
to
purpose
because
of
that
unsleeping
care
she
was
last
to
bed
and
first
to
stir
and
billy
jack
declared
that
she
used
to
put
the
cats
to
sleep
at
night
and
waken
up
the
roosters
in
the
morning
and
through
it
all
her
face
remained
serene
and
her
voice
flowed
in
quiet
tones
billy
jack
adored
her
with
all
the
might
of
his
big
heart
and
body
thomas
slow
of
motion
as
of
expression
found
in
her
the
center
of
his
somewhat
sluggish
being
jessac
the
little
maiden
of
nine
years
whose
face
was
the
very
replica
of
her
mother
knew
nothing
in
the
world
dearer
albeit
in
her
daily
little
housewifely
tasks
she
felt
the
gentle
pressure
of
that
steadfast
mind
and
unyielding
purpose
her
husband
regarded
her
with
a
curious
mingling
of
reverence
and
defiance
for
donald
finch
was
an
obstinate
man
with
a
man
love
of
authority
and
a
scotchman
sense
of
his
right
to
rule
in
his
own
house
but
while
he
talked
much
about
his
authority
and
made
a
great
show
of
absolutism
with
his
family
he
was
secretly
conscious
that
another
will
than
his
had
really
kept
things
moving
about
the
farm
for
he
had
long
ago
learned
that
his
wife
was
always
right
while
he
might
often
be
wrong
and
that
withal
her
soft
words
and
gentle
ways
hers
was
a
will
like
steel
besides
the
law
of
order
another
law
ruled
in
the
finch
household
the
law
of
work
the
days
were
filled
with
work
for
they
each
had
their
share
to
do
and
bore
the
sole
responsibility
for
its
being
well
done
if
the
cows
failed
in
their
milk
or
the
fat
cattle
were
not
up
to
the
mark
the
father
felt
the
reproach
as
his
to
billy
jack
fell
the
care
and
handling
of
the
horses
thomas
took
charge
of
the
pigs
and
the
getting
of
wood
and
water
for
the
house
little
jessac
had
her
daily
task
of
sorting
the
rooms
and
when
the
days
were
too
stormy
or
the
snow
too
deep
for
school
she
had
in
addition
her
stent
of
knitting
or
of
winding
the
yarn
for
the
weaver
to
the
mother
fell
all
the
rest
at
the
cooking
and
the
cleaning
and
the
making
and
the
mending
all
fine
arts
with
her
she
diligently
toiled
from
long
before
dawn
till
after
all
the
rest
were
abed
but
besides
these
and
other
daily
household
duties
there
were
in
their
various
seasons
the
jam
and
jelly
the
pumpkin
and
squash
preserves
the
and
and
more
than
all
the
long
long
work
with
the
wool
billy
jack
used
to
say
that
the
little
mother
followed
that
wool
from
the
backs
of
her
sheep
to
the
backs
of
her
family
and
hated
to
let
the
weaver
have
his
turn
at
it
what
with
the
washing
and
the
oiling
of
it
the
carding
and
the
spinning
the
twisting
and
the
winding
she
never
seemed
to
be
done
and
then
when
it
came
back
from
the
weaver
in
great
webs
of
and
flannel
and
winsey
there
was
all
the
cutting
shaping
and
sewing
before
the
family
could
get
it
on
their
backs
true
the
tailor
was
called
in
to
help
but
though
he
declared
he
worked
no
place
else
as
he
worked
at
the
finch
it
was
billy
jack
openly
expressed
opinion
that
he
worked
his
jaw
more
than
his
needle
for
at
he
gave
his
needle
a
but
though
hughie
of
course
knew
nothing
of
this
toiling
and
moiling
he
was
distinctly
conscious
of
an
air
of
tidiness
and
comfort
and
quiet
and
was
keenly
alive
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
splendid
supper
waiting
him
when
he
got
in
from
the
stables
with
the
others
hungry
as
a
as
billy
jack
expressed
it
and
that
was
a
supper
fried
ribs
of
fresh
pork
and
hashed
potatoes
hot
and
brown
followed
by
buckwheat
pancakes
hot
and
brown
with
maple
syrup
there
was
tea
for
the
father
and
mother
with
their
oat
cakes
but
for
the
children
no
such
luxury
only
the
choice
of
buttermilk
or
sweet
milk
hughie
it
is
true
was
offered
tea
but
he
promptly
declined
for
though
he
loved
it
well
enough
it
was
sufficient
reason
for
him
that
thomas
had
none
it
took
however
all
the
grace
out
of
his
declining
that
finch
remarked
in
gruff
pleasantry
what
would
a
boy
want
with
tea
the
supper
was
a
very
solemn
meal
they
were
all
too
busy
to
talk
at
least
so
hughie
felt
and
as
for
himself
he
was
only
afraid
lest
the
others
should
push
back
before
he
had
satisfied
the
terrible
craving
within
him
after
supper
the
books
were
taken
and
in
gaelic
for
though
donald
finch
was
perfectly
able
in
english
for
business
and
ordinary
affairs
of
life
when
it
came
to
the
worship
of
god
he
found
that
only
in
the
ancient
mother
tongue
could
he
get
as
hughie
listened
to
the
solemn
reading
and
then
to
the
prayer
that
followed
though
he
could
understand
only
a
word
now
and
again
he
was
greatly
impressed
with
the
rhythmic
solemn
cadence
of
the
voice
and
as
he
glanced
through
his
fingers
at
the
old
man
face
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
completely
it
had
changed
it
was
no
longer
the
face
of
the
stern
and
stubborn
autocrat
but
of
an
earnest
humble
reverent
man
of
god
and
hughie
looking
at
him
wondered
if
he
would
not
be
altogether
nicer
with
his
wife
and
boys
after
that
prayer
was
done
he
had
yet
to
learn
how
obstinate
and
even
hard
a
man
can
be
and
still
have
a
great
gift
in
from
the
old
man
face
hughie
glance
wandered
to
his
wife
and
there
was
held
fascinated
for
the
first
time
hughie
thought
it
was
beautiful
and
more
than
that
he
was
startled
to
find
that
it
reminded
him
of
his
mother
at
once
he
closed
his
eyes
for
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
prying
where
he
had
no
right
after
the
prayer
was
over
they
all
drew
about
the
glowing
polished
kitchen
stove
with
the
open
front
and
set
themselves
to
enjoy
that
hour
which
more
than
any
other
helps
to
weave
into
the
memory
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
in
after
days
are
associated
with
home
old
donald
drew
forth
his
pipe
a
pleased
expectation
upon
his
face
and
after
cutting
enough
tobacco
from
the
black
plug
which
he
pulled
from
his
trousers
pocket
he
rolled
it
fine
with
deliberation
and
packed
it
carefully
into
his
pipe
from
which
dangled
a
tin
cap
then
drawing
out
some
live
coals
from
the
fire
he
with
a
quick
motion
picked
one
up
set
it
upon
the
top
of
the
tobacco
and
holding
it
there
with
his
bare
finger
until
hughie
was
sure
he
would
burn
himself
puffed
with
hard
smacking
puffs
but
with
a
more
comfortable
expression
than
hughie
had
yet
seen
him
wear
then
when
it
was
fairly
lit
he
knocked
off
the
coal
packed
down
the
tobacco
put
on
the
little
tin
cap
and
sat
back
in
his
covered
and
came
as
near
beaming
upon
the
world
as
ever
he
allowed
himself
to
come
here
jessac
he
said
to
the
little
maiden
slipping
about
the
table
under
the
mother
silent
direction
jessac
glanced
at
her
mother
and
hesitated
then
apparently
reading
her
mother
face
she
said
in
a
minute
da
and
seizing
the
broom
which
was
much
taller
than
herself
she
began
to
brush
up
the
crumbs
about
the
table
with
amazing
deftness
this
task
completed
and
the
crumbs
being
thrown
into
the
pig
barrel
which
stood
in
the
woodshed
just
outside
the
door
jessac
set
her
broom
in
the
corner
hung
up
the
on
its
proper
nail
behind
the
stove
and
then
running
to
her
father
climbed
up
on
his
knee
and
snuggled
down
into
his
arms
for
an
hour
luxurious
laziness
before
the
fire
hughie
gazed
in
amazement
at
her
temerity
for
donald
finch
was
not
a
man
to
take
liberties
with
but
as
he
gazed
he
wondered
the
more
for
again
the
face
of
the
stern
old
man
was
transformed
be
quaet
now
lassie
hear
me
now
i
am
telling
you
he
admonished
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
while
there
flowed
over
his
face
a
look
of
delight
that
seemed
to
fill
up
and
smooth
out
all
its
severe
lines
hughie
was
still
gazing
and
wondering
when
the
old
man
catching
his
earnest
gaze
broke
forth
suddenly
in
a
voice
nearly
jovial
well
lad
so
you
have
taken
up
the
school
again
you
will
be
having
a
fine
time
of
it
the
lad
startled
more
by
the
joviality
of
his
manner
than
by
the
suddenness
of
his
speech
hastily
replied
indeed
we
are
not
what
what
replied
the
old
man
returning
to
his
normal
aspect
of
severity
do
you
not
know
that
you
have
great
privileges
now
huh
grunted
hughie
if
we
had
archie
munro
and
what
is
wrong
with
the
new
man
oh
i
do
know
he
not
a
bit
nice
he
too
many
rules
said
thomas
slowly
aha
said
his
father
with
a
note
of
triumph
in
his
tone
so
it
is
it
he
will
be
bringing
you
to
the
mark
i
warrant
you
and
indeed
it
high
time
for
i
doubt
archie
munro
was
just
a
little
soft
with
the
old
man
tone
was
aggravating
enough
but
his
reference
to
the
old
master
was
too
much
for
hughie
and
even
thomas
was
moved
to
words
more
than
was
his
wont
in
his
father
presence
he
has
too
many
rules
repeated
thomas
stolidly
and
they
will
not
be
and
he
is
as
proud
as
he
can
be
continued
hughie
comes
along
with
his
cane
and
his
collar
and
lifts
his
hat
off
to
the
big
girls
and
and
och
he
just
as
as
anything
vocabulary
was
not
equal
to
his
contempt
there
will
not
be
much
wrong
with
his
cane
in
the
twentieth
school
i
dare
say
went
on
the
old
man
grimly
as
for
lifting
his
hat
it
is
time
some
of
them
were
learning
manners
when
i
was
a
boy
we
were
made
to
mind
our
manners
i
can
tell
so
are
we
replied
hughie
hotly
but
we
do
go
shoween
off
like
that
and
then
himself
and
his
rules
hughie
disgust
was
quite
unutterable
rules
exclaimed
the
old
man
ay
that
is
what
is
the
well
said
hughie
with
a
spice
of
mischief
if
thomas
is
late
for
school
he
will
have
to
bring
a
note
of
very
good
indeed
and
why
should
he
be
late
at
all
and
if
any
one
wants
a
pencil
he
ca
ask
for
it
unless
he
gets
permission
from
the
capital
said
the
old
man
rubbing
his
hands
delightedly
he
the
right
sort
and
if
you
keep
thomas
home
a
day
or
a
week
you
will
have
to
write
to
the
master
about
it
continued
hughie
and
what
for
pray
said
the
old
man
hastily
may
i
not
keep
but
yes
that
a
very
fine
rule
too
it
will
keep
the
boys
from
the
woods
i
am
but
think
of
big
murdie
cameron
holding
up
his
hand
to
ask
leave
to
speak
to
bob
fraser
and
why
not
indeed
if
he
not
too
big
to
be
in
school
he
not
too
big
for
that
man
alive
you
should
have
seen
the
master
in
my
school
days
lay
the
lads
over
the
forms
and
warm
their
backs
to
as
big
as
murdie
ay
and
bigger
and
what
more
he
would
send
for
them
to
their
homes
and
bring
them
strapped
to
a
yon
was
a
master
for
you
hughie
snorted
huh
i
tell
you
what
we
would
stand
that
and
we
wo
stand
this
man
and
what
will
you
be
doing
now
hughie
quizzed
the
old
man
well
said
hughie
reddening
at
the
sarcasm
i
will
not
do
much
but
the
big
boys
will
just
carry
him
and
who
will
be
daring
to
do
that
hughie
well
murdie
and
bob
fraser
and
curly
ross
and
don
and
and
thomas
there
added
hughie
fearing
to
hurt
thomas
feelings
by
leaving
him
out
ay
said
the
old
man
shutting
his
lips
tight
on
his
pipestem
and
puffing
with
a
smacking
noise
let
me
catch
thomas
at
that
and
i
would
help
too
said
hughie
valiantly
fearing
he
had
exposed
his
friend
and
wishing
to
share
his
danger
well
your
father
would
be
seeing
to
that
said
the
old
man
with
great
satisfaction
feeling
that
hughie
discipline
might
be
safely
left
in
the
minister
hands
there
was
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
and
then
a
quiet
voice
inquired
gently
he
will
be
a
very
big
man
hughie
i
oh
just
ordinary
said
hughie
innocently
turning
to
finch
oh
then
they
will
not
be
requiring
you
and
thomas
i
am
thinking
to
carry
him
at
which
hughie
and
billy
jack
and
jessac
laughed
aloud
but
thomas
and
his
father
only
looked
stolidly
into
the
fire
come
thomas
said
his
mother
take
your
fiddle
a
bit
hughie
will
like
a
there
was
no
need
of
any
further
discussing
the
new
master
but
thomas
was
very
shy
about
his
fiddle
and
besides
he
was
not
in
a
mood
for
it
his
father
words
had
rasped
him
it
took
the
united
persuasions
of
billy
jack
and
jessac
and
hughie
to
get
the
fiddle
into
thomas
hands
but
after
a
few
tuning
scrapes
all
shyness
and
moodiness
vanished
and
soon
the
reels
and
strathspeys
were
dropping
from
flying
fingers
in
a
way
that
set
hughie
blood
tingling
but
when
the
fiddler
struck
into
money
musk
billy
jack
signed
jessac
to
him
and
whispering
to
her
set
her
out
on
the
middle
of
the
floor
aw
i
do
like
to
said
jessac
twisting
her
apron
into
her
mouth
come
away
jessac
said
her
mother
quietly
do
your
and
jessac
laying
aside
shyness
went
at
her
highland
reel
with
the
same
serious
earnestness
she
gave
to
her
tidying
or
her
knitting
daintily
she
tripped
the
steps
of
that
intricate
ancient
dance
of
the
celt
people
whirling
balancing
poising
snapping
her
fingers
and
twinkling
her
feet
in
the
true
highland
style
till
once
more
her
father
face
smoothed
out
its
wrinkles
and
beamed
like
a
harvest
moon
hughie
gazed
uncertain
whether
to
allow
himself
to
admire
performance
or
to
regard
it
with
a
boy
scorn
as
she
was
only
a
girl
and
yet
he
could
not
escape
the
fascination
of
the
swift
rhythmic
movement
of
the
neat
twinkling
feet
well
done
jessac
lass
said
her
father
proudly
but
what
would
the
minister
be
saying
at
such
frivolity
he
added
glancing
at
hughie
huh
he
can
do
it
himself
well
enough
said
hughie
and
i
tell
you
what
i
only
wish
i
could
do
i
show
you
said
jessac
shyly
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
hughie
courage
failed
and
though
he
would
have
given
much
to
be
able
to
make
his
feet
twinkle
through
the
mazes
of
the
highland
reel
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
accept
teaching
from
jessac
if
it
had
only
been
thomas
or
billy
jack
who
had
offered
he
would
soon
enough
have
been
on
the
floor
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
with
a
sudden
inspiration
he
cried
all
right
do
it
again
i
but
the
mother
said
quietly
i
think
that
will
do
jessac
and
i
am
afraid
your
father
will
be
going
with
cold
hands
if
you
do
hurry
with
those
and
jessac
put
up
her
lip
with
the
true
girl
grimace
and
went
away
for
her
knitting
to
hughie
disappointment
and
relief
soon
billy
jack
took
down
the
tin
lantern
pierced
with
holes
into
curious
patterns
through
which
the
rayed
forth
and
went
out
to
bed
the
horses
in
spite
of
protests
from
all
the
family
hughie
set
forth
with
him
carrying
the
lantern
and
feeling
very
much
the
farmer
while
billy
jack
took
two
pails
of
boiled
oats
and
barley
with
a
mixture
of
which
was
supposed
to
give
to
the
finch
team
their
famous
and
superior
gloss
when
they
returned
from
the
stable
they
found
in
the
kitchen
thomas
who
was
rubbing
a
composition
of
tallow
and
into
his
boots
to
make
them
and
the
mother
who
was
going
about
setting
the
table
for
the
breakfast
too
bad
you
have
to
go
to
bed
mother
said
billy
jack
struggling
with
his
you
might
just
go
on
getting
the
breakfast
and
what
a
fine
start
that
would
give
you
for
the
you
hurry
william
john
to
bed
with
that
poor
lad
what
would
his
mother
say
he
must
be
fairly
i
not
a
bit
tired
said
hughie
brightly
his
face
radiant
with
the
delight
of
his
new
experiences
you
will
need
all
your
sleep
my
boy
said
the
mother
kindly
for
we
rise
early
here
but
she
added
you
will
lie
till
the
boys
are
through
with
their
work
and
thomas
will
waken
you
for
your
indeed
no
i
going
to
get
up
announced
hughie
but
hughie
said
billy
jack
seriously
if
you
and
thomas
are
going
to
carry
out
that
man
you
will
need
a
mighty
lot
of
sleep
hush
william
john
said
the
mother
to
her
eldest
son
you
tease
hughie
and
it
not
good
to
be
saying
such
things
even
in
fun
to
boys
like
thomas
and
that
true
mother
for
they
rather
fierce
indeed
they
are
not
that
and
i
am
sure
they
will
do
nothing
that
will
shame
their
to
this
hughie
made
no
reply
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
harmonize
the
thought
of
his
parents
with
the
exploit
of
ejecting
the
master
from
the
school
so
he
only
said
good
night
and
went
off
with
the
silent
thomas
to
bed
but
in
the
visions
of
his
head
which
haunted
him
the
night
long
racing
horses
and
little
girls
with
tossing
curls
and
twinkling
feet
were
strangely
mingled
with
wild
conflicts
with
the
new
master
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
hardly
dropped
off
to
sleep
when
he
was
awake
again
to
see
thomas
standing
beside
him
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
announcing
that
breakfast
was
ready
have
you
been
out
to
the
stable
he
eagerly
inquired
and
thomas
nodded
in
great
disappointment
and
a
little
shamefacedly
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
it
seemed
to
hughie
as
if
it
must
be
still
the
night
before
for
it
was
quite
dark
outside
he
had
never
had
breakfast
by
before
in
his
life
and
he
felt
as
if
it
all
were
still
a
part
of
his
dreams
until
he
found
himself
sitting
beside
billy
jack
on
a
load
of
waving
good
by
to
the
group
at
the
door
the
old
man
whose
face
in
the
gray
morning
light
had
resumed
its
wonted
severe
look
the
quiet
little
woman
smiling
kindly
at
him
and
bidding
him
come
again
and
the
little
maid
at
her
side
with
the
dark
ringlets
who
glanced
at
him
from
behind
the
shelter
of
her
mother
skirts
with
shy
boldness
as
hughie
was
saying
his
good
bys
he
was
thinking
most
of
the
twinkling
feet
and
the
tossing
curls
and
so
he
added
to
his
farewells
good
by
jessac
i
going
to
learn
that
reel
from
you
some
day
and
then
turning
about
he
forgot
all
about
her
and
her
reel
for
billy
jack
horses
were
pawing
to
be
off
and
rolling
their
solemn
bells
while
their
breath
rose
in
white
clouds
above
their
heads
wreathing
their
manes
in
hoary
rime
lads
said
billy
jack
hauling
his
lines
taut
and
flourishing
his
whip
the
bays
straightened
their
backs
hung
for
a
few
moments
on
their
tugs
for
the
load
had
frozen
fast
during
the
night
and
then
moved
off
at
a
smart
trot
the
bells
solemnly
booming
out
and
the
sleighs
creaking
over
the
frosty
snow
man
said
hughie
enthusiastically
i
wish
i
could
draw
logs
all
it
not
too
bad
a
job
on
a
day
like
this
assented
billy
jack
and
indeed
any
one
might
envy
him
the
work
on
such
a
morning
over
the
treetops
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
beginning
to
shoot
their
rosy
darts
up
into
the
sky
and
to
flood
the
clearing
with
light
that
sparkled
and
shimmered
upon
the
frost
particles
glittering
upon
and
glorifying
snow
and
trees
and
even
the
stumps
and
fences
around
the
clearing
stood
the
forest
dark
and
still
except
for
the
frost
reports
that
now
and
then
rang
out
like
pistol
shots
to
hughie
the
early
morning
invested
the
forest
with
a
new
beauty
and
a
new
wonder
the
dim
light
of
the
dawning
day
deepened
the
silence
so
that
involuntarily
he
hushed
his
voice
in
speaking
and
the
roll
of
the
seemed
to
smite
upon
that
dim
solemn
quiet
with
startling
blows
on
either
side
the
balsams
and
spruces
with
their
mantles
of
snow
stood
like
sentinels
on
guard
silent
motionless
alert
hughie
looked
to
see
them
move
as
the
team
drove
past
as
they
left
the
more
open
butternut
ridge
and
descended
into
the
depths
of
the
big
pine
swamp
the
dim
light
faded
into
deeper
gloom
and
hughie
felt
as
if
he
were
in
church
and
an
awe
gathered
upon
him
it
awful
still
he
said
to
billy
jack
in
a
low
tone
and
billy
jack
catching
the
look
in
the
boy
face
checked
the
light
word
upon
his
lips
and
gazed
around
into
the
deep
forest
glooms
with
new
eyes
the
mystery
and
wonder
of
the
forest
had
never
struck
him
before
it
had
hitherto
been
to
him
a
place
for
hunting
or
for
getting
big
but
he
saw
it
with
hughie
eyes
and
felt
the
majesty
of
its
beauty
and
silence
for
a
long
time
they
drove
without
a
word
say
it
mighty
fine
is
it
he
said
adopting
hughie
low
tone
splendid
exclaimed
hughie
my
i
could
just
hug
those
big
trees
they
look
at
me
like
like
your
mother
do
they
or
mine
but
this
was
beyond
billy
jack
like
my
mother
yes
you
know
quiet
and
and
kind
and
yes
said
thomas
breaking
in
for
the
first
time
that
just
it
they
do
look
sure
enough
like
my
mother
and
yours
they
have
both
got
that
said
billy
jack
to
his
team
these
fellows
be
something
bad
if
we
do
get
into
the
open
soon
should
wonder
if
they
got
already
making
out
their
mothers
like
an
old
white
pine
i
say
oh
pshaw
said
hughie
you
know
what
i
not
much
i
do
but
it
do
matter
so
long
as
you
feelin
all
right
this
swamp
rather
bad
for
the
what
hughie
eyes
began
to
open
wide
as
he
glanced
into
the
forest
the
groojums
never
heard
of
them
things
they
ketch
a
fellow
in
places
like
this
when
it
gettin
on
towards
midnight
and
about
daylight
almost
as
what
are
they
like
asked
hughie
upon
whom
the
spell
of
the
forest
lay
oh
mighty
queer
always
crawl
up
on
your
back
and
ye
ca
help
twistin
hughie
glanced
at
thomas
and
was
at
once
relieved
oh
pshaw
billy
jack
you
ca
fool
me
i
know
i
guess
you
safe
enough
now
they
do
bother
you
much
in
the
clearing
said
billy
jack
encouragingly
oh
fiddle
i
not
nobody
is
in
the
open
and
especially
in
the
oh
i
do
care
for
your
old
guess

care
more
for
your
new
boss
yonder
eh
said
billy
jack
nodding
toward
the
which
now
came
into
view
oh
said
hughie
with
a
groan
i
just
hate
going
you
be
all
right
when
you
get
there
said
billy
jack
cheerfully
it
like
goin
in
soon
they
were
at
the
good
by
billy
jack
said
hughie
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
on
a
long
long
visit
i
had
an
awfully
good
time
and
i
like
to
go
back
with
wish
you
would
said
billy
jack
heartily
come
again
soon
and
carry
out
the
master
it
looks
like
a
storm
he
might
get
he
had
better
mind
out
then
cried
hughie
after
billy
jack
and
set
off
with
thomas
for
the
school
but
neither
hughie
nor
thomas
had
any
idea
of
the
thrilling
experiences
awaiting
them
in
the
twentieth
school
before
the
week
was
done
chapter
v
the
crisis
the
first
days
of
that
week
were
days
of
strife
murdie
cameron
and
bob
fraser
and
the
other
big
boys
succeeded
in
keeping
in
line
with
the
master
rules
and
regulations
they
were
careful
never
to
be
late
and
so
saved
themselves
the
degradation
of
bringing
an
excuse
but
the
smaller
boys
set
themselves
to
make
the
master
life
a
burden
and
succeeded
beyond
their
highest
expectations
for
the
master
was
quick
of
temper
and
was
determined
at
all
costs
to
exact
full
and
prompt
obedience
there
was
more
flogging
done
those
first
six
days
than
during
any
six
months
of
archie
munro
rule
sometimes
the
floggings
amounted
to
little
but
sometimes
they
were
serious
and
when
those
fell
upon
the
smaller
boys
the
girls
would
weep
and
the
bigger
boys
would
grind
their
teeth
and
swear
the
situation
became
so
acute
that
murdie
cameron
and
the
big
boys
decided
that
they
would
quit
the
school
they
were
afraid
the
temptation
to
throw
the
master
out
would
some
day
be
more
than
they
could
bear
and
for
men
who
had
played
their
part
not
without
credit
in
the
scotch
river
fights
to
carry
out
the
master
would
have
been
an
exploit
hardly
worthy
of
them
so
in
dignified
contempt
of
the
master
and
his
rules
they
left
the
school
after
the
third
day
their
absence
did
not
help
matters
much
indeed
the
master
appeared
to
be
relieved
and
proceeded
to
tame
the
school
into
submission
it
was
little
jimmie
cameron
who
precipitated
the
crisis
jimmie
nose
upon
which
he
relied
when
struggling
with
his
snickers
had
an
unpleasant
trick
of
failing
him
at
critical
moments
and
of
letting
out
explosive
snorts
of
the
most
disturbing
kind
he
had
finally
been
warned
that
upon
his
next
outburst
punishment
would
fall
it
was
friday
afternoon
the
drowsy
hour
just
before
recess
while
the
master
was
explaining
to
the
listless
euclid
class
the
mysteries
of
the
proposition
that
suddenly
a
snort
of
unusual
violence
burst
upon
the
school
immediately
every
eye
was
upon
the
master
for
all
had
heard
and
had
noted
his
threat
to
jimmie
james
was
that
you
sir
there
was
no
answer
except
such
as
could
be
gathered
from
jimmie
very
red
and
very
shamed
face
james
stand
up
jimmie
wriggled
to
his
feet
and
stood
a
heap
of
various
angles
now
james
you
remember
what
i
promised
you
come
here
sir
jimmie
came
slowly
to
the
front
growing
paler
at
each
step
and
stood
with
a
dazed
look
on
his
face
before
the
master
he
had
never
been
thrashed
in
all
his
life
at
home
the
big
brothers
might
cuff
him
or
his
mother
thump
him
on
the
head
with
her
thimble
but
a
serious
whipping
was
to
him
an
unknown
horror
the
master
drew
forth
his
heavy
black
strap
with
impressive
deliberation
and
ominous
silence
the
preparations
for
punishment
were
so
elaborate
and
imposing
that
the
big
boys
guessed
that
the
punishment
itself
would
not
amount
to
much
not
so
jimmie
he
stood
numb
with
fear
and
horrible
expectation
the
master
lifted
up
the
strap
james
hold
out
your
hand
jimmie
promptly
clutched
his
hand
behind
his
back
hold
out
your
hand
sir
at
once
no
answer
james
you
must
do
as
you
are
told
your
punishment
for
disobedience
will
be
much
severer
than
for
but
jimmie
stood
pale
silent
with
his
hands
tight
clasped
behind
his
back
the
master
stepped
forward
and
grasping
the
little
boy
arm
tried
to
pull
his
hand
to
the
front
but
jimmie
with
a
roar
like
that
of
a
young
bull
threw
himself
flat
on
his
face
on
the
floor
and
put
his
hands
under
him
the
school
burst
into
a
laugh
of
triumph
which
increased
the
master
embarrassment
and
rage
silence
he
said
or
it
will
be
a
worse
matter
for
some
of
you
than
for
then
turning
his
attention
to
jimmie
be
lifted
him
from
the
floor
and
tried
to
pull
out
his
hand
but
jimmie
kept
his
arms
folded
tight
across
his
breast
roaring
vigorously
the
while
and
saying
over
and
over
go
away
from
me
go
away
from
me
i
tell
you
i
not
taking
anything
to
do
with
the
big
boys
were
enjoying
the
thing
immensely
the
master
rage
was
deepening
in
proportion
he
felt
it
would
never
do
to
be
beaten
his
whole
authority
was
at
stake
now
james
he
reasoned
you
see
you
are
only
making
it
worse
for
yourself
i
can
not
allow
any
disobedience
in
the
school
you
must
hold
out
your
but
jimmie
realizing
that
he
had
come
off
best
in
the
first
round
stood
doggedly
sniffing
his
arms
still
folded
tight
now
james
i
shall
give
you
one
more
chance
hold
out
your
jimmie
remained
like
a
statue
whack
came
the
heavy
strap
over
his
shoulders
at
once
jimmie
set
up
his
refrain
go
away
from
me
i
tell
you
i
not
taking
anything
to
do
with
you
whack
whack
whack
fell
the
strap
with
successive
blows
each
heavier
than
the
last
there
was
no
longer
any
laughing
in
the
school
the
affair
was
growing
serious
the
girls
were
beginning
to
sob
and
the
bigger
boys
to
grow
pale
now
james
will
you
hold
out
your
hand
you
see
how
much
worse
you
are
making
it
for
yourself
said
the
master
who
was
heartily
sick
of
the
struggle
which
he
felt
to
be
undignified
and
the
result
of
which
he
feared
was
dubious
but
jimmie
only
kept
up
his
cry
now
punctuated
with
sobs
i
not
taking
anything
to
do
with
jimmie
listen
to
me
said
the
master
you
must
hold
out
your
hand
i
can
not
have
boys
refusing
to
obey
me
in
this
but
jimmie
caught
the
entreaty
in
the
tone
and
knowing
that
the
battle
was
nearly
over
kept
obstinately
silent
well
then
said
the
master
suddenly
you
must
take
it
and
lifting
the
strap
he
laid
it
with
such
sharp
emphasis
over
jimmie
shoulders
that
jimmie
voice
rose
in
a
wilder
roar
than
usual
and
the
girls
burst
into
audible
weeping
suddenly
above
all
the
hubbub
rose
a
voice
clear
and
sharp
stop
it
was
thomas
finch
of
all
people
standing
with
face
white
and
tense
and
regarding
the
master
with
steady
eyes
the
school
gazed
thunderstruck
at
the
usually
slow
and
stolid
thomas
what
do
you
mean
sir
said
the
master
gladly
turning
from
jimmie
but
thomas
stood
silent
as
much
surprised
as
the
master
at
his
sudden
exclamation
he
stood
hesitating
for
a
moment
and
then
said
you
can
thrash
me
in
his
place
he
a
little
chap
and
has
never
been
the
master
misunderstood
his
hesitation
for
fear
pushed
jimmie
aside
threw
down
his
strap
and
seized
a
birch
rod
come
forward
sir
i
put
an
end
to
your
insubordination
at
any
rate
hold
out
your
hand
thomas
held
out
his
hand
till
the
master
finished
one
birch
rod
the
other
hand
sir
another
birch
rod
was
used
up
but
thomas
neither
uttered
a
sound
nor
made
a
move
till
the
master
had
done
then
he
asked
in
a
strained
voice
were
you
going
to
give
jimmie
all
that
sir
the
master
caught
the
biting
sneer
in
the
tone
and
lost
himself
completely
do
you
dare
to
answer
me
back
he
cried
he
opened
his
desk
took
out
a
rawhide
and
without
waiting
to
ask
for
his
hand
began
to
lay
the
rawhide
about
thomas
shoulders
and
legs
till
he
was
out
of
breath
now
perhaps
you
will
learn
your
place
sir
he
said
thank
you
said
thomas
looking
him
steadily
in
the
eye
you
are
welcome
and
i
give
you
as
much
more
whenever
you
show
that
you
need
the
slight
laugh
with
which
he
closed
this
brutal
speech
made
thomas
wince
as
he
had
not
during
his
whole
terrible
thrashing
but
still
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
now
james
come
here
said
the
master
turning
to
jimmie
you
see
what
happens
when
a
boy
is
jimmie
came
trembling
hold
out
your
hand
out
came
jimmie
hand
at
once
whack
fell
the
strap
the
other
stop
it
roared
thomas
i
took
his
the
other
said
the
master
ignoring
thomas
with
a
curious
savage
snarl
thomas
sprung
at
him
the
master
however
was
on
the
alert
and
swinging
round
met
him
with
a
straight
facer
between
the
eyes
and
thomas
went
to
the
floor
aha
my
boy
i
teach
you
something
you
have
yet
to
for
answer
came
another
cry
come
on
boys
it
was
ranald
macdonald
coming
over
the
seats
followed
by
don
cameron
billy
ross
and
some
smaller
boys
the
master
turned
to
meet
them
come
along
he
said
backing
up
to
his
desk
but
i
warn
you
it
not
a
strap
or
a
rawhide
i
shall
ranald
paid
no
attention
to
his
words
but
came
straight
toward
him
and
when
at
arm
length
sprung
at
him
with
the
cry
horo
boys
but
before
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
the
master
he
received
a
blow
straight
on
the
bridge
of
the
nose
that
staggered
him
back
stunned
and
bleeding
by
this
time
thomas
was
up
again
and
rushing
in
was
received
in
like
manner
and
fell
back
over
a
bench
how
do
you
like
it
boys
smiled
the
master
come
right
the
boys
obeyed
his
invitation
approaching
him
but
more
warily
and
awaiting
their
chance
to
rush
suddenly
thomas
with
a
savage
snarl
put
his
head
down
and
rushed
in
beneath
the
master
guard
paid
no
attention
to
the
heavy
blow
he
received
on
the
head
and
locking
his
arms
round
the
master
middle
buried
his
head
close
into
his
chest
at
once
ranald
and
billy
ross
threw
themselves
upon
the
struggling
pair
and
carried
them
to
the
floor
the
master
underneath
there
was
a
few
moments
of
fierce
struggling
and
then
the
master
lay
still
with
the
four
boys
holding
him
down
for
dear
life
it
was
thomas
who
assumed
command
do
choke
him
so
ranald
he
said
and
clear
out
of
the
way
all
you
girls
and
little
what
are
you
going
to
do
thomas
asked
don
acknowledging
leadership
tie
him
up
said
thomas
get
me
a
at
once
two
or
three
little
boys
rushed
to
the
hooks
and
brought
one
or
two
of
the
knitted
sashes
that
hung
there
and
thomas
proceeded
to
tie
the
master
legs
while
he
was
thus
busily
engaged
a
shadow
darkened
the
door
and
a
voice
exclaimed
what
is
all
this
about
it
was
the
minister
who
had
been
driving
past
and
had
come
upon
the
terrified
weeping
children
rushing
home
is
that
you
thomas
and
you
don
the
boys
let
go
their
hold
and
stood
up
shamed
but
defiant
immediately
the
master
was
on
his
feet
and
with
a
swift
fierce
blow
caught
thomas
on
the
chin
thomas
taken
off
his
guard
fell
with
a
thud
on
the
floor
stop
that
young
man
said
the
minister
catching
his
arm
that
a
coward
hands
off
said
the
master
shaking
himself
free
and
squaring
up
to
him
ye
would
would
ye
said
the
minister
gripping
him
by
the
neck
and
shaking
him
as
he
might
a
child
lift
ye
hand
to
me
would
ye
i
break
you
back
to
ye
and
that
i
so
saying
the
minister
seized
him
by
the
arms
and
held
him
absolutely
helpless
the
master
ceased
to
struggle
and
put
down
his
hands
ay
ye
better
my
man
said
the
minister
giving
him
a
fling
backward
meantime
don
had
been
holding
snow
to
thomas
head
and
had
brought
him
round
now
then
said
the
minister
to
the
boys
what
does
all
this
mean
the
boys
were
all
silent
but
the
master
spoke
it
is
a
case
of
rank
and
impudent
insubordination
sir
and
i
demand
the
expulsion
of
those
impudent
well
sir
said
the
minister
be
sure
there
will
be
a
thorough
investigation
and
i
greatly
misjudge
the
case
if
there
are
not
faults
on
both
sides
and
for
one
thing
the
man
who
can
strike
such
a
cowardly
blow
as
you
did
a
moment
ago
would
not
be
unlikely
to
be
guilty
of
injustice
and
it
is
none
of
your
business
said
the
master
insolently
you
will
find
that
i
shall
make
it
my
business
said
the
minister
and
now
boys
be
off
to
your
homes
and
be
here
monday
morning
at
nine
when
this
matter
shall
be
gone
chapter
vi
one
that
ruleth
well
his
own
house
the
news
of
the
school
trouble
ran
through
the
section
like
fire
through
a
brule
the
younger
generations
when
they
heard
how
thomas
finch
had
dared
the
master
raised
him
at
once
to
the
rank
of
hero
but
the
heads
of
families
received
the
news
doubtfully
and
wondered
what
the
rising
generation
was
coming
to
the
next
day
billy
jack
heard
the
story
in
the
twentieth
store
and
with
some
anxiety
waited
for
the
news
to
reach
his
father
ears
for
to
tell
the
truth
billy
jack
man
though
he
was
held
his
father
in
dread
how
did
you
come
to
do
it
he
asked
thomas
why
did
you
let
don
begin
it
was
surely
don
i
do
know
it
slipped
out
replied
thomas
i
could
stand
jimmie
yelling
any
longer
i
did
know
i
said
anything
till
i
found
myself
standing
up
and
after
that
i
did
seem
to
care
for
man
it
was
fine
though
said
billy
jack
i
did
think
it
was
in
and
thomas
felt
more
than
repaid
for
all
his
cruel
beating
it
was
something
to
win
the
approval
of
billy
jack
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
it
was
at
church
on
the
sabbath
day
that
donald
finch
heard
about
his
son
doings
in
the
school
the
week
before
the
minister
in
his
sermon
thought
fit
to
dwell
upon
the
tendency
of
the
rising
generation
to
revolt
against
authority
in
all
things
and
solemnly
laid
upon
parents
the
duty
and
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
they
ruled
their
households
well
it
was
not
just
the
advice
that
donald
finch
stood
specially
in
need
of
but
he
was
highly
pleased
with
the
sermon
and
was
enlarging
upon
it
in
the
churchyard
where
the
people
gathered
between
the
services
when
peter
mcrae
thinking
that
old
donald
was
hardly
taking
the
advice
to
himself
as
he
ought
and
not
knowing
that
the
old
man
was
ignorant
of
all
that
had
happened
in
the
school
answered
him
somewhat
severely
it
is
good
to
be
approving
the
sermon
but
i
would
rather
be
seeing
you
make
a
practical
application
of
indeed
that
is
true
replied
donald
and
it
would
not
be
amiss
for
more
than
me
to
make
application
of
indeed
then
if
all
reports
be
true
replied
peter
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
begin
at
mr
mcrae
said
donald
earnestly
it
is
myself
that
knows
well
enough
my
shortcomings
but
if
there
is
any
special
reason
for
your
remark
i
am
not
aware
of
this
light
treatment
of
what
to
peter
had
seemed
a
grievous
offense
against
all
authority
incensed
the
old
dominie
beyond
all
endurance
and
do
you
not
think
that
the
conduct
of
your
son
last
week
calls
for
any
reproof
and
is
it
you
that
will
stand
up
and
defend
it
in
the
face
of
the
minister
and
his
sermon
upon
it
this
day
donald
gazed
at
him
a
few
moments
as
if
he
had
gone
mad
at
length
he
replied
slowly
i
do
not
wish
to
forget
that
you
are
an
elder
of
the
church
mcrae
and
i
will
not
be
charging
you
with
telling
lies
on
me
and
my
family
tut
tut
man
broke
in
long
john
cameron
seeing
how
the
matter
stood
he
just
referring
to
yon
little
difference
thomas
had
with
the
master
last
week
but
it
just
nothing
come
away
thomas
gasped
donald
my
thomas
you
have
not
heard
then
said
peter
in
surprise
and
old
donald
only
shook
his
head
then
it
time
you
did
replied
peter
severely
for
such
things
are
a
disgrace
to
the
nonsense
said
long
john
not
a
bit
of
it
i
think
none
the
less
of
thomas
for
but
in
matters
of
this
kind
long
john
could
hardly
be
counted
an
authority
for
it
was
not
so
very
long
ago
since
he
had
been
beguiled
into
an
affair
at
the
scotch
river
which
while
it
brought
him
laurels
at
the
hands
of
the
younger
generation
did
not
add
to
his
reputation
with
the
elders
of
the
church
it
did
not
help
matters
much
that
murdie
cameron
and
others
of
his
set
proceeded
to
congratulate
old
donald
in
their
own
way
upon
his
achievement
and
with
all
the
more
fervor
that
they
perceived
that
it
moved
the
solemn
peter
to
righteous
wrath
from
one
and
another
the
tale
came
forth
with
embellishments
till
donald
finch
was
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
voiceless
rage
and
humiliation
that
when
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
psalm
the
congregation
moved
into
the
church
for
the
gaelic
service
the
old
man
departed
for
his
home
trembling
silent
amazed
how
thomas
could
have
brought
this
disgrace
upon
him
he
could
not
imagine
if
it
had
been
william
john
who
with
all
his
good
nature
had
a
temper
brittle
enough
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
and
then
the
minister
sermon
of
which
he
had
spoken
in
such
open
and
enthusiastic
approval
how
it
condemned
him
for
his
neglect
of
duty
toward
his
family
and
held
up
his
authority
over
his
household
to
scorn
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
his
pride
it
is
the
lord
judgment
upon
me
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tramped
his
way
through
the
woods
it
is
the
curse
of
eli
that
is
hanging
over
me
and
and
with
many
vows
he
resolved
that
at
all
costs
he
would
do
his
duty
in
this
crisis
and
bring
thomas
to
a
sense
of
his
sins
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
he
met
his
family
at
the
after
their
return
from
the
gaelic
service
what
is
this
i
hear
about
you
thomas
he
began
as
thomas
came
in
and
took
his
place
at
the
table
what
is
this
i
hear
about
you
sir
he
repeated
making
a
great
effort
to
maintain
a
calm
and
judicial
tone
thomas
remained
silent
partly
because
he
usually
found
speech
difficult
but
chiefly
because
he
dreaded
his
father
wrath
what
is
this
that
has
become
the
talk
of
the
countryside
and
the
disgrace
of
my
name
continued
the
father
in
deepening
tones
no
very
great
disgrace
surely
said
billy
jack
lightly
hoping
to
turn
his
father
anger
be
you
silent
sir
commanded
the
old
man
sternly
i
will
ask
for
your
opinion
when
i
require
it
you
and
others
beside
you
in
this
house
need
to
learn
your
billy
jack
made
no
reply
fearing
to
make
matters
worse
though
he
found
it
hard
not
to
resent
this
taunt
which
he
knew
well
was
flung
at
his
mother
i
wonder
at
you
thomas
after
such
a
sermon
as
yon
i
wonder
you
are
able
to
sit
there
unconcerned
at
this
table
i
wonder
you
are
not
hiding
your
head
in
shame
and
the
old
man
was
lashing
himself
into
a
white
rage
while
thomas
sat
looking
stolidly
before
him
his
slow
tongue
finding
no
words
of
defense
and
indeed
he
had
little
thought
of
defending
himself
he
was
conscious
of
an
acute
and
yet
struggling
through
his
mind
there
was
a
feeling
that
in
some
sense
he
could
not
define
there
was
justification
for
what
he
had
done
it
is
not
often
that
thomas
has
grieved
you
ventured
the
mother
timidly
for
with
all
her
courage
she
feared
her
husband
when
he
was
in
this
mood
woman
be
silent
blazed
forth
the
old
man
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
words
it
is
not
for
you
to
excuse
his
wickedness
you
are
too
fond
of
that
work
and
your
children
are
reaping
the
fruits
of
billy
jack
looked
up
quickly
as
if
to
answer
but
his
mother
turned
her
face
full
upon
him
and
commanded
him
with
steady
eyes
giving
herself
no
sign
of
emotion
except
for
a
slight
tightening
of
the
lips
and
a
touch
of
color
in
her
face
your
children
have
well
learned
their
lesson
of
rebellion
and
deceit
continued
her
husband
allowing
his
passion
a
free
rein
but
i
vow
unto
the
lord
i
will
put
an
end
to
it
now
whatever
and
i
will
give
you
to
remember
sir
turning
to
thomas
to
the
end
of
your
days
this
occasion
and
now
hence
from
this
table
let
me
not
see
your
face
till
the
sabbath
is
past
and
then
if
the
lord
spares
me
i
shall
deal
with
thomas
hesitated
a
moment
as
if
he
had
not
quite
taken
in
his
words
then
leaving
his
supper
untouched
he
rose
slowly
and
without
a
word
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
loft
the
mother
followed
him
a
moment
with
her
eyes
and
then
once
more
turning
to
billy
jack
held
him
with
calm
steady
gaze
her
immediate
fear
was
for
her
eldest
son
thomas
she
knew
would
in
the
mean
time
simply
suffer
what
might
be
his
lot
but
for
many
a
day
she
had
lived
in
terror
of
an
outbreak
between
her
eldest
son
and
her
husband
again
billy
jack
caught
her
look
and
commanded
himself
to
silence
the
fire
is
low
william
john
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
billy
jack
rose
and
from
the
behind
the
stove
replenished
the
fire
reading
perfectly
his
mother
mind
and
resolving
at
all
costs
to
do
her
will
at
the
taking
of
the
books
that
night
the
prayer
which
was
spoken
in
a
tone
of
awful
and
almost
inaudible
solemnity
was
for
the
most
part
an
exaltation
of
the
majesty
and
righteousness
of
the
government
of
god
and
a
lamentation
over
the
wickedness
and
rebellion
of
mankind
and
billy
jack
thought
it
was
no
good
augury
that
it
closed
with
a
petition
for
grace
to
maintain
the
honor
of
that
government
and
to
uphold
that
righteous
majesty
in
all
the
relations
of
life
it
was
a
woeful
evening
to
them
all
and
as
soon
as
possible
the
household
went
miserably
to
bed
before
going
to
her
room
the
mother
slipped
up
quietly
to
the
loft
and
found
thomas
lying
in
his
bunk
dressed
and
awake
he
was
still
puzzling
out
his
ethical
problem
his
conscience
clearly
condemned
him
for
his
fight
with
the
master
and
yet
somehow
he
could
not
regret
having
stood
up
for
jimmie
and
taken
his
punishment
he
expected
no
mercy
at
his
father
hands
next
morning
the
punishment
he
knew
would
be
cruel
enough
but
it
was
not
the
pain
that
thomas
was
dreading
he
was
dimly
struggling
with
the
sense
of
outrage
for
ever
since
the
moment
he
had
stood
up
and
uttered
his
challenge
to
the
master
he
had
felt
himself
to
be
different
that
moment
now
seemed
to
belong
to
the
distant
years
when
he
was
a
boy
and
now
he
could
not
imagine
himself
submitting
to
a
flogging
from
any
man
and
it
seemed
to
him
strange
and
almost
impossible
that
even
his
father
should
lift
his
hand
to
him
you
are
not
sleeping
thomas
said
his
mother
going
up
to
his
bunk
no
and
you
have
had
no
supper
at
i
do
want
any
the
mother
sat
silent
beside
him
for
a
time
and
then
said
quietly
you
did
not
tell
me
no
mother
i
did
it
would
have
been
better
that
your
father
should
have
heard
this
from
i
mean
should
have
heard
it
at
home
and
you
might
have
told
me
yes
mother
i
wish
now
i
had
but
indeed
i
ca
understand
how
it
happened
i
do
feel
as
if
it
was
me
at
and
then
thomas
told
his
mother
all
the
tale
finishing
his
story
with
the
words
and
i
help
it
mother
at
the
mother
remained
silent
for
a
little
and
then
with
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
she
replied
no
thomas
i
know
you
could
help
it
and
i
here
her
voice
quite
broke
i
am
not
ashamed
of
are
you
not
mother
said
thomas
sitting
up
suddenly
in
great
surprise
then
i
do
care
i
could
make
it
out
never
you
mind
thomas
it
will
be
well
and
she
leaned
over
him
and
kissed
him
thomas
felt
her
face
wet
with
tears
and
his
stolid
reserve
broke
down
oh
mother
mother
i
do
care
now
he
cried
his
breath
coming
in
great
sobs
i
do
care
at
and
he
put
his
arms
round
his
mother
clinging
to
her
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
i
know
laddie
i
know
whispered
his
mother
never
you
fear
never
and
then
as
if
to
herself
she
added
thank
the
lord
you
are
not
a
coward
thomas
found
himself
again
without
words
but
he
held
his
mother
fast
his
big
body
shaking
with
his
sobs
and
thomas
she
continued
after
a
pause
your
father
we
must
just
be
all
her
life
long
this
had
been
her
struggle
and
and
he
is
a
good
her
tears
were
now
flowing
fast
and
her
voice
had
quite
lost
its
calm
thomas
was
alarmed
and
distressed
he
had
never
in
all
his
life
seen
his
mother
weep
and
rarely
had
heard
her
voice
break
do
mother
he
said
growing
suddenly
quiet
himself
do
you
mind
mother
it
be
all
right
and
i
not
yes
she
said
rising
and
regaining
her
it
will
be
all
right
thomas
you
go
to
and
there
were
such
evident
reserves
of
strength
behind
her
voice
that
thomas
lay
down
certain
that
all
would
be
well
his
mother
had
never
failed
him
the
mother
went
downstairs
with
the
purpose
in
her
heart
of
having
a
talk
with
her
husband
but
donald
finch
knew
her
ways
well
and
had
resolved
that
he
would
have
no
speech
with
her
upon
the
matter
for
he
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
persevere
in
his
intention
to
deal
with
thomas
if
he
allowed
his
wife
to
have
any
talk
with
him
the
morning
brought
the
mother
no
opportunity
of
speech
with
her
husband
he
contrary
to
his
custom
remained
until
breakfast
in
his
room
outside
in
the
kitchen
he
could
hear
billy
jack
cheerful
tones
and
hearty
laugh
and
it
angered
him
to
think
that
his
displeasure
should
have
so
little
effect
upon
his
household
if
the
house
had
remained
shrouded
in
gloom
and
the
family
had
gone
about
on
tiptoes
and
with
bated
breath
it
would
have
shown
no
more
than
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
father
displeasure
but
as
billy
jack
cheerful
words
and
laughter
fell
upon
his
ear
he
renewed
his
vows
to
do
his
duty
that
day
in
upholding
his
authority
and
bringing
to
his
son
a
due
sense
of
his
sin
in
grim
silence
he
ate
his
breakfast
except
for
a
sharp
rebuke
to
billy
jack
who
had
been
laboring
throughout
the
meal
to
make
cheerful
conversation
with
jessac
and
his
mother
at
his
father
rebuke
billy
jack
dropped
his
cheerful
tone
and
avoiding
his
mother
eyes
he
assumed
at
once
an
attitude
of
open
defiance
his
tones
and
words
plainly
offering
to
his
father
war
if
war
he
would
have
you
will
come
to
me
in
the
room
after
breakfast
said
his
father
as
thomas
rose
to
go
to
the
stable
there
a
meeting
of
the
trustees
at
nine
at
the
at
which
thomas
must
be
present
interposed
billy
jack
in
firm
steady
tones
he
may
go
when
i
have
done
with
him
said
his
father
angrily
and
meantime
you
will
attend
to
your
own
yes
sir
i
will
that
billy
jack
response
came
back
with
fierce
promptness
the
old
man
glanced
at
him
caught
the
light
in
his
eyes
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
throwing
all
restraint
to
the
winds
thundered
out
what
do
you
mean
sir
what
i
say
i
am
going
to
attend
to
my
own
business
and
that
billy
jack
tone
was
quick
eager
defiant
again
the
old
man
hesitated
and
then
replied
go
to
it
i
am
going
and
i
am
going
to
take
thomas
to
that
meeting
at
nine
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
business
there
said
the
old
man
sarcastically
then
you
may
know
it
now
blazed
forth
billy
jack
for
i
am
going
and
as
sure
as
i
stand
here
i
will
see
that
thomas
gets
fair
play
there
if
he
does
at
home
if
i
have
to
lick
every
trustee
in
the
hold
your
peace
sir
said
his
father
coming
nearer
him
do
not
give
me
any
impertinence
and
do
not
accuse
me
of
have
you
heard
thomas
side
of
the
story
returned
billy
jack
i
have
heard
enough
and
more
than
you
have
heard
both
i
know
the
truth
of
it
whatever
the
shameful
and
disgraceful
truth
of
it
i
know
that
the
is
ringing
with
it
i
know
that
in
the
house
of
god
the
minister
held
up
my
family
to
the
scorn
of
the
people
and
i
vowed
to
do
my
duty
to
my
the
old
man
passion
had
risen
to
such
a
height
that
for
a
moment
billy
jack
quailed
before
it
in
the
pause
that
followed
the
old
outburst
the
mother
came
to
her
son
hush
william
john
you
are
not
to
forget
yourself
nor
your
duty
to
your
father
and
to
me
thomas
will
receive
full
justice
in
this
there
was
a
quiet
strength
and
dignity
in
her
manner
that
commanded
immediate
attention
from
both
men
the
mother
went
on
in
a
low
even
voice
your
father
has
his
duty
to
perform
and
you
must
not
take
upon
yourself
to
billy
jack
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
that
his
mother
should
desert
him
and
should
support
what
he
knew
she
felt
to
be
injustice
and
tyranny
was
more
than
he
could
understand
no
less
perplexed
was
her
husband
as
they
stood
there
looking
at
each
other
uncertain
as
to
the
next
step
there
came
a
knock
at
the
back
door
the
mother
went
to
open
it
pausing
on
her
way
to
push
back
some
chairs
and
put
the
room
to
rights
thus
allowing
the
family
to
regain
its
composure
good
morning
finch
you
will
be
thinking
i
have
slept
in
your
barn
all
it
was
long
john
cameron
come
away
in
cameron
it
is
never
too
early
for
friends
to
come
to
this
house
said
finch
her
voice
showing
her
great
relief
long
john
came
in
glanced
shrewdly
about
and
greeted
finch
with
great
heartiness
it
a
fine
winter
day
finch
but
it
looks
as
if
we
might
have
a
storm
you
are
busy
with
the
logs
i
old
donald
was
slowly
recovering
himself
and
a
fine
lot
you
are
having
continued
long
john
i
was
just
saying
the
other
day
that
it
was
wonderful
the
work
you
could
get
indeed
it
is
hard
enough
to
do
anything
here
said
donald
finch
with
some
bitterness
you
may
say
so
responded
long
john
cheerfully
the
snow
is
that
deep
in
the
bush
and
you
were
wanting
to
see
me
cameron
interrupted
donald
i
have
a
business
on
hand
which
requires
indeed
and
so
have
i
for
it
is
and
indeed
it
is
just
as
well
you
and
all
should
know
it
for
my
disgrace
is
well
disgrace
exclaimed
long
john
ay
disgrace
for
is
it
not
a
disgrace
to
have
the
conduct
of
your
family
become
the
occasion
of
a
sermon
on
the
lord
day
indeed
i
did
not
think
much
of
yon
sermon
whatever
replied
long
john
i
can
not
agree
with
you
cameron
it
was
a
powerful
sermon
and
it
was
only
too
sorely
needed
but
i
hope
it
will
not
be
without
profit
to
indeed
it
is
not
the
sermon
you
have
much
need
of
said
long
john
for
every
one
knows
what
a
ay
it
is
myself
that
needs
it
but
with
the
help
of
the
lord
i
will
be
doing
my
duty
this
and
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
replied
long
john
for
that
is
why
i
am
and
what
may
you
have
to
do
with
it
asked
the
old
man
as
to
that
indeed
replied
long
john
coolly
i
am
not
yet
quite
sure
but
if
i
might
ask
without
being
too
bold
what
is
the
particular
duty
to
which
you
are
referring
you
may
ask
and
you
and
all
have
a
right
to
know
for
i
am
about
to
visit
upon
my
son
his
sins
and
and
is
it
meaning
to
wheep
him
you
are
ay
said
the
old
man
and
his
lips
came
fiercely
together
indeed
then
you
will
just
do
no
such
thing
this
and
by
what
right
do
you
interfere
in
my
domestic
affairs
demanded
old
donald
with
dignity
answer
me
that
right
or
no
right
replied
long
john
before
any
man
lays
a
finger
on
thomas
there
he
will
need
to
begin
with
myself
and
he
added
grimly
there
are
not
many
in
the
county
who
would
care
for
that
old
donald
finch
looked
at
his
visitor
in
speechless
amazement
at
length
long
john
grew
excited
man
alive
he
exclaimed
it
a
quare
father
you
are
you
may
be
thinking
it
disgrace
but
the
section
will
be
proud
that
there
is
a
boy
in
it
brave
enough
to
stand
up
for
the
weak
against
a
brute
and
then
he
proceeded
to
tell
the
tale
as
he
had
heard
it
from
don
with
such
strong
passion
and
such
rude
vigor
that
in
spite
of
himself
old
donald
found
his
rage
vanish
and
his
heart
began
to
move
within
him
toward
his
son
and
it
is
for
that
cried
long
john
dashing
his
fist
into
his
open
palm
it
is
for
that
that
you
would
punish
your
son
may
god
forgive
me
but
the
man
that
lays
a
finger
on
thomas
yonder
will
come
into
sore
grief
this
day
ay
lad
continued
long
john
striding
toward
thomas
and
gripping
him
by
the
shoulders
with
both
hands
you
are
a
man
and
you
stood
up
for
the
weak
yon
day
and
if
you
efer
will
be
wanting
a
friend
remember
john
well
well
cameron
said
old
donald
who
was
more
deeply
moved
than
he
cared
to
show
it
maybe
as
you
say
it
maybe
the
lad
was
not
so
much
in
the
in
the
wrong
roared
long
john
blowing
his
nose
hard
in
the
wrong
may
my
boys
ever
be
in
the
wrong
in
such
a
way
well
said
old
donald
we
shall
see
about
this
and
if
thomas
has
suffered
injustice
it
is
not
his
father
will
refuse
to
see
him
and
soon
they
were
all
off
to
the
meeting
at
the
thomas
was
the
last
to
leave
the
room
as
usual
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
a
word
but
stood
white
and
trembling
but
as
he
found
himself
alone
with
his
mother
once
more
his
stolid
reserve
broke
down
and
he
burst
into
a
strange
and
broken
cry
oh
mother
mother
but
he
could
get
no
further
never
mind
laddie
said
his
mother
you
have
borne
yourself
well
and
your
mother
is
proud
of
at
the
investigation
held
in
the
it
became
clear
that
though
the
insubordination
of
both
jimmie
and
thomas
was
undeniable
the
provocation
by
the
master
had
been
very
great
and
though
the
minister
who
was
superintendent
of
instruction
for
the
district
insisted
that
the
master
authority
must
at
all
costs
be
upheld
such
was
the
rage
of
old
donald
finch
and
long
john
cameron
that
the
upshot
was
that
the
master
took
his
departure
from
the
section
glad
enough
to
escape
with
bones
unbroken
chapter
vii
foxy
after
the
expulsion
of
the
master
the
twentieth
school
fell
upon
evil
days
for
the
trustees
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
try
gurl
teachers
as
hughie
contemptuously
called
them
and
this
policy
prevailed
for
two
or
three
years
with
the
result
that
the
big
boys
left
the
school
and
with
their
departure
the
old
heroic
age
passed
away
to
be
succeeded
by
an
age
soft
and
distinctly
commercial
the
spirit
of
this
unheroic
age
was
incarnate
in
the
person
of
foxy
ross
foxy
got
his
name
in
the
first
instance
from
the
peculiar
pinky
red
shade
of
hair
that
crowned
his
white
fat
face
but
the
name
stuck
to
him
as
appropriately
descriptive
of
his
tricks
and
his
manners
his
face
was
large
and
smooth
and
fat
with
wide
mouth
and
teeth
that
glistened
when
he
smiled
his
smile
was
like
his
face
large
and
smooth
and
fat
his
eyes
which
were
light
gray
white
hughie
called
them
were
shifty
avoiding
the
gaze
that
sought
to
read
them
or
piercingly
keen
according
as
he
might
choose
after
the
departure
of
the
big
boys
foxy
gradually
grew
in
influence
until
his
only
rival
in
the
school
was
hughie
foxy
father
was
the
storekeeper
in
the
twentieth
and
this
brought
within
foxy
reach
possibilities
of
influence
that
gave
him
an
immense
advantage
over
hughie
by
means
of
and
lickerish
sticks
foxy
could
win
the
allegiance
of
all
the
smaller
boys
and
many
of
the
bigger
ones
while
with
the
girls
both
big
and
small
his
willingness
to
please
and
his
smooth
manners
won
from
many
affection
and
from
the
rest
toleration
although
betsy
dan
campbell
asserted
that
whenever
foxy
ross
came
near
her
she
felt
something
creeping
up
her
backbone
with
the
teacher
too
foxy
was
a
great
favorite
he
gave
her
worshipful
reverence
and
many
gifts
from
his
father
store
eloquent
of
his
devotion
he
was
never
detected
in
mischief
and
was
always
ready
to
expose
the
misdemeanors
of
the
other
boys
thus
it
came
that
foxy
was
the
paramount
influence
within
the
school
outside
his
only
rival
was
hughie
and
at
times
hughie
rivalry
became
dangerous
in
all
games
that
called
for
skill
activity
and
reckless
daring
hughie
was
easily
leader
in
old
sow
prisoner
base
but
especially
in
the
ancient
and
noble
game
of
shinny
hughie
shone
peerless
and
supreme
foxy
hated
games
and
shinny
the
joy
of
those
giants
of
old
who
had
torn
victory
from
the
sixteenth
and
even
from
the
front
one
glorious
year
was
at
once
foxy
disgust
and
terror
as
a
little
boy
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
avoid
turning
his
back
to
wait
shuddering
with
humping
shoulders
for
the
enemy
charge
and
in
anything
like
a
melee
he
could
not
help
jumping
into
the
air
at
every
dangerous
stroke
and
thus
he
brought
upon
himself
the
contempt
even
of
boys
much
smaller
than
himself
who
under
the
splendid
and
heroic
example
of
those
who
led
them
had
only
one
ambition
to
get
a
whack
at
the
ball
and
this
ambition
they
gratified
on
every
possible
occasion
reckless
of
consequences
hence
when
the
last
of
the
big
boys
thomas
finch
against
whose
solid
mass
hosts
had
flung
themselves
to
destruction
finally
left
the
school
foxy
with
great
skill
managed
to
divert
the
energies
of
the
boys
to
games
less
violent
and
dangerous
and
by
means
of
his
and
his
liquorice
and
his
large
fat
smile
he
drew
after
him
a
very
considerable
following
of
both
girls
and
boys
the
most
interesting
and
most
successful
of
foxy
schemes
was
the
game
of
store
which
he
introduced
foxy
himself
being
the
storekeeper
he
had
the
trader
genius
for
discovering
and
catering
to
the
weaknesses
of
people
and
hence
his
store
became
for
certain
days
of
the
week
the
center
of
life
during
the
recreation
hours
the
store
itself
was
a
somewhat
pretentious
successor
to
the
little
brush
cabin
with
wide
open
front
where
in
the
old
days
the
boys
used
to
gather
and
lying
upon
piles
of
fragrant
balsam
boughs
before
the
big
blazing
fire
placed
in
front
used
to
listen
to
the
master
talk
and
occasionally
read
foxy
store
was
built
of
slabs
covered
with
thick
brush
and
set
off
with
a
plank
counter
and
shelves
whereon
were
displayed
his
wares
his
stock
was
never
too
large
for
his
personal
transportation
but
its
variety
was
almost
infinite
and
liquorice
maple
sugar
and
other
sweeties
were
staples
then
too
there
were
balls
of
gum
beautifully
clear
which
in
its
raw
state
foxy
gathered
from
the
ends
of
the
pine
logs
at
the
sawmill
and
which
by
a
process
of
boiling
and
clarifying
known
only
to
himself
he
brought
to
a
marvelous
perfection
but
foxy
genius
did
not
confine
itself
to
sweets
he
would
buy
and
sell
and
swap
anything
but
in
swapping
no
bargain
was
ever
completed
unless
there
was
money
for
foxy
in
the
deal
he
had
goods
and
new
and
marbles
knives
with
brass
handles
that
would
break
square
which
were
greatly
desired
by
all
and
buckskin
whangs
but
foxy
financial
ability
never
displayed
itself
with
more
brilliancy
than
when
he
organized
the
various
games
of
the
school
so
as
to
have
them
begin
and
end
with
the
store
when
the
river
and
pond
were
covered
with
clear
black
ice
skating
would
be
the
rage
and
then
foxy
store
would
be
hung
with
and
with
torches
which
were
greatly
in
demand
for
the
skating
parties
that
thronged
the
pond
at
night
there
were
no
torches
like
foxy
the
dry
cedar
bark
any
one
could
get
from
the
fences
but
foxy
torches
were
always
well
soaked
in
oil
and
bound
with
wire
and
were
prepared
with
such
excellent
skill
that
they
always
burned
brighter
and
held
together
longer
than
any
others
these
torches
foxy
disposed
of
to
the
larger
boys
who
came
down
to
the
pond
at
night
foxy
methods
of
finance
were
undoubtedly
marked
by
ability
and
inasmuch
as
his
accounts
were
never
audited
the
profits
were
large
and
sure
he
made
it
a
point
to
purchase
a
certain
proportion
of
his
supplies
from
his
father
who
was
proud
of
his
son
financial
ability
but
whether
his
purchases
always
equaled
his
sales
no
one
ever
knew
if
the
pond
and
river
were
covered
with
snow
then
foxy
would
organize
a
when
all
the
old
pistols
in
the
section
would
be
brought
forth
and
the
store
would
display
a
supply
of
gun
caps
by
the
explosion
of
which
deadly
ammunition
the
deer
would
be
dropped
in
their
tracks
and
drawn
to
the
store
by
prancing
steeds
whose
trappings
had
been
purchased
from
foxy
when
the
interest
in
the
began
to
show
signs
of
waning
foxy
would
bring
forth
a
supply
of
gunpowder
for
the
purchase
of
which
any
boy
who
owned
a
pistol
would
be
ready
to
bankrupt
himself
in
this
hughie
took
a
leading
part
although
he
had
to
depend
upon
the
generosity
of
others
for
the
thrilling
excitement
of
bringing
down
his
deer
with
a
for
hughie
had
never
been
able
to
save
coppers
enough
to
purchase
a
pistol
of
his
own
but
with
pistols
was
forbidden
by
the
teacher
from
the
day
when
hughie
in
his
eagerness
to
bring
his
quarry
down
left
his
ramrod
in
his
pistol
and
firing
at
aleck
dan
campbell
at
range
laid
him
low
with
a
lump
on
the
side
of
his
head
as
big
as
a
marble
the
only
thing
that
saved
aleck
life
the
teacher
declared
was
his
thick
crop
of
black
hair
foxy
was
in
great
wrath
at
hughie
for
his
recklessness
which
laid
the
under
the
teacher
ban
and
which
interfered
seriously
with
the
profits
of
the
store
but
foxy
was
far
too
great
a
man
to
allow
himself
to
be
checked
by
any
such
misfortune
as
this
he
was
far
too
astute
to
attempt
to
defy
the
teacher
and
carry
on
the
forbidden
game
but
with
great
ability
he
adapted
the
principles
of
to
a
game
even
more
exciting
and
profitable
he
organized
the
game
of
injuns
some
of
the
boys
being
set
apart
as
settlers
who
were
to
defend
the
fort
of
which
the
store
was
the
center
the
rest
to
constitute
the
invading
force
of
savages
the
result
was
that
the
trade
in
caps
and
gunpowder
was
brisker
than
ever
for
not
only
was
the
powder
needed
for
the
pistols
but
even
larger
quantities
were
necessary
for
the
which
hissed
their
wrath
at
the
approaching
enemy
and
the
mounted
guns
for
which
earthen
did
excellently
set
out
on
a
big
stump
to
explode
to
the
destruction
of
scores
of
creeping
redskins
advancing
through
the
bush
who
after
being
mutilated
and
mangled
by
these
terrible
explosions
were
dragged
into
the
camp
and
scalped
foxy
success
was
phenomenal
the
few
pennies
and
fewer
and
dimes
that
the
boys
had
hoarded
for
many
long
weeks
would
soon
have
been
exhausted
had
hughie
not
wrecked
the
game
hughie
alone
had
no
fear
of
foxy
but
despised
him
utterly
he
had
stood
and
yelled
when
those
heroes
of
old
murdie
and
don
cameron
curly
ross
and
ranald
macdonald
and
last
but
not
to
be
despised
thomas
finch
had
done
battle
with
the
enemy
from
the
sixteenth
or
the
front
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
acknowledge
the
leadership
of
foxy
ross
for
all
his
and
liquorice
not
but
what
hughie
yearned
for
and
liquorice
with
great
yearning
but
these
could
not
atone
to
him
for
the
loss
out
of
his
life
of
the
stir
and
rush
and
daring
of
the
old
fighting
days
and
it
galled
him
that
the
boys
of
the
sixteenth
could
flout
the
boys
of
the
twentieth
in
all
places
and
on
all
occasions
with
impunity
but
above
all
it
seemed
to
him
a
standing
disgrace
that
the
habitant
teamsters
from
the
north
who
in
former
days
found
it
a
necessary
and
wise
precaution
to
put
their
horses
to
a
gallop
as
they
passed
the
school
in
order
to
escape
with
sleighs
intact
from
the
hordes
that
lined
the
roadway
now
drove
slowly
past
the
very
gate
without
an
apparent
tremor
but
besides
all
this
he
had
an
instinctive
shrinking
from
foxy
and
sympathized
with
betsy
dan
in
her
creepy
feeling
whenever
he
approached
hence
he
refused
allegiance
and
drew
upon
himself
jealous
hatred
it
was
one
of
foxy
few
errors
in
judgment
that
from
his
desire
to
humiliate
hughie
and
to
bring
him
to
a
proper
state
of
subjection
he
succeeded
in
shutting
him
out
from
the
leadership
in
the
game
of
injuns
for
hughie
promptly
refused
a
subordinate
position
and
withdrew
like
achilles
to
his
tent
but
unlike
achilles
though
he
sulked
he
sulked
actively
and
to
some
purpose
for
drawing
off
with
him
his
two
faithful
henchmen
fusie
neither
hughie
nor
any
one
else
ever
knew
another
name
for
the
little
french
boy
who
had
drifted
into
the
settlement
and
made
his
home
with
the
macleods
and
davie
scotch
a
cousin
of
davie
macdougall
newly
arrived
from
scotland
he
placed
them
in
positions
which
commanded
the
store
entrance
and
waited
until
the
settlers
had
all
departed
upon
their
expedition
against
the
invading
indians
foxy
with
one
or
two
smaller
boys
was
left
in
charge
of
the
store
waiting
for
trade
in
a
few
moments
foxy
head
appeared
at
the
door
when
whiz
a
snowball
skinned
his
ear
and
flattened
itself
with
a
bang
against
the
slabs
hold
on
there
stop
that
you
too
close
up
shouted
foxy
thinking
that
the
invaders
were
breaking
the
rules
of
the
game
bang
a
snowball
from
another
quarter
caught
him
fair
in
the
neck
here
you
fools
you
stop
that
cried
foxy
turning
in
the
direction
whence
the
snowball
came
and
dodging
round
to
the
side
of
the
store
but
this
was
hughie
point
of
attack
and
soon
foxy
found
that
the
only
place
of
refuge
was
inside
whither
he
fled
closing
the
door
after
him
immediately
the
door
became
a
target
for
the
hidden
foe
meantime
the
indian
war
was
progressing
but
now
and
again
a
settler
would
return
to
the
fort
for
ammunition
and
the
moment
he
reached
the
door
a
volley
of
snowballs
would
catch
him
and
hasten
his
entrance
once
in
it
was
dangerous
to
come
out
by
degrees
hughie
augmented
his
besieging
force
from
the
more
adventurous
settlers
and
indians
and
placed
them
in
the
bush
surrounding
the
door
the
war
game
was
demoralized
but
the
new
game
proved
so
much
more
interesting
that
it
was
taken
up
with
enthusiasm
and
prosecuted
with
vigor
it
was
rare
sport
for
the
whole
noon
hour
hughie
and
his
bombarding
force
kept
foxy
and
his
friends
in
close
confinement
from
which
they
were
relieved
only
by
the
ringing
of
the
school
bell
for
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
hughie
and
his
men
having
had
their
game
fled
from
foxy
wrath
to
the
shelter
of
the
school
when
foxy
appeared
it
was
discovered
that
one
eye
was
half
shut
but
the
light
that
gleamed
from
the
other
was
sufficiently
baleful
to
give
token
of
the
wrath
blazing
within
and
hughie
was
not
a
little
anxious
to
know
what
form
foxy
vengeance
would
take
but
to
his
surprise
by
the
time
recess
had
come
foxy
wrath
had
apparently
vanished
and
he
was
willing
to
treat
hughie
exploit
in
the
light
of
a
joke
the
truth
was
foxy
never
allowed
passion
to
interfere
with
business
and
hence
he
resolved
that
he
must
swallow
his
rage
for
he
realized
clearly
that
hughie
was
far
too
dangerous
as
a
foe
and
that
he
might
become
exceedingly
valuable
as
an
ally
within
a
week
hughie
was
foxy
partner
in
business
enjoying
hugely
the
privilege
of
dispensing
the
store
goods
with
certain
perquisites
that
naturally
attached
to
him
as
storekeeper
chapter
viii
foxy
partner
it
was
an
evil
day
for
hughie
when
he
made
friends
with
foxy
and
became
his
partner
in
the
store
business
for
hughie
hoardings
were
never
large
and
after
buying
a
christmas
present
for
his
mother
according
to
his
unfailing
custom
they
were
reduced
to
a
very
few
pennies
indeed
the
opportunities
for
investment
in
his
new
position
were
many
and
alluring
but
all
hughie
soul
went
out
in
longing
for
a
pistol
which
foxy
had
among
his
goods
and
which
would
fire
not
only
caps
but
powder
and
ball
and
his
longing
was
sensibly
increased
by
foxy
generously
allowing
him
to
try
the
pistol
first
at
a
mark
which
hughie
hit
and
then
at
a
red
squirrel
which
he
missed
by
day
hughie
yearned
for
this
pistol
by
night
he
dreamed
of
it
but
how
he
might
secure
it
for
his
own
he
did
not
know
upon
this
point
he
felt
he
could
not
consult
his
mother
his
usual
counselor
for
he
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
she
would
not
approve
of
his
having
a
pistol
in
his
possession
and
as
for
his
father
hughie
knew
he
would
soon
make
short
work
of
any
such
what
would
a
child
like
hughie
do
with
a
pistol
he
had
never
had
a
pistol
in
all
his
life
it
was
difficult
for
the
minister
to
realize
that
young
canada
was
a
new
type
and
he
would
have
been
more
than
surprised
had
any
one
told
him
that
already
hughie
although
only
twelve
was
an
expert
with
a
gun
having
for
many
a
saturday
during
the
long
sunny
fall
roamed
the
woods
at
first
in
company
with
don
and
afterwards
with
don
gun
alone
or
followed
by
fusie
or
davie
scotch
there
was
thus
no
help
for
hughie
at
home
the
price
of
the
pistol
reduced
to
the
lowest
possible
sum
was
two
dollars
and
a
half
which
foxy
declared
was
only
half
what
he
would
charge
any
one
else
but
his
partner
how
much
have
you
got
altogether
he
asked
hughie
one
day
when
hughie
was
groaning
over
his
poverty
six
pennies
and
two
dimes
was
hughie
disconsolate
reply
he
had
often
counted
them
over
of
course
he
went
on
there
my
xl
knife
that
worth
a
lot
only
the
point
of
the
big
blade
huh
grunted
foxy
there
jist
the
stub
it
not
said
hughie
indignantly
it
more
than
half
then
and
it
bully
good
stuff
too
it
nick
any
knife
in
the
school
and
hughie
dived
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
his
knife
with
a
handful
of
boy
treasures
hullo
said
foxy
snatching
a
from
hughie
hand
whose
is
that
here
you
give
me
that
that
not
mine
cried
hughie
whose
is
it
then
i
do
know
i
guess
it
mother
i
found
it
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
i
know
it
how
do
you
know
i
know
well
enough
she
often
puts
money
on
the
window
and
it
fell
down
give
me
that
i
tell
you
hughie
eyes
were
blazing
dangerously
and
foxy
handed
back
the
o
all
right
you
a
pretty
big
fool
he
said
indifferently
seekers
finders
keepers
that
my
hughie
was
silent
holding
his
precious
in
his
hand
deep
in
his
pocket
say
said
foxy
changing
the
subject
i
guess
you
had
better
pay
up
for
your
powder
and
caps
you
been
i
have
been
firing
much
said
hughie
confidently
well
you
been
firing
pretty
steady
for
three
three
weeks
it
is
three
it
is
there
this
week
and
last
week
when
the
bust
too
soon
and
burnt
fusie
eyebrows
and
the
week
before
when
you
shot
aleck
dan
and
it
was
the
week
before
that
you
began
and
that
make
it
how
much
asked
hughie
desperately
resolved
to
know
the
worst
foxy
had
been
preparing
for
this
he
took
down
a
box
with
a
sliding
lid
and
drew
out
a
bundle
of
crumbled
slips
which
hughie
with
sinking
heart
recognized
as
his
own
vouchers
sixteen
foxy
had
taken
care
of
this
part
of
the
business
sixteen
exclaimed
hughie
snatching
up
the
bunch
count
them
yourself
said
foxy
calmly
knowing
well
he
could
count
on
hughie
honesty
seventeen
said
hughie
hopelessly
but
one
of
those
i
did
count
said
foxy
generously
that
the
one
i
gave
you
to
try
at
the
first
now
i
tell
you
went
on
foxy
insinuatingly
you
have
got
how
much
at
home
he
inquired
six
pennies
and
two
hughie
tone
indicated
despair
you
got
six
pennies
and
two
dimes
six
pennies
and
two
dimes
twenty
that
cents
now
if
you
paid
me
that
cents
and
if
you
could
get
a
anywhere
that
would
be
i
tell
you
what
i
would
do
i
would
let
you
have
that
pistol
for
only
one
dollar
more
that
ai
much
he
said
only
a
dollar
more
said
hughie
calculating
rapidly
but
where
would
i
get
the
fifty
cents
the
dollar
seemed
at
that
moment
to
hughie
quite
a
possible
thing
if
only
the
fifty
cents
could
be
got
the
dollar
was
more
remote
and
therefore
less
pressing
foxy
had
an
inspiration
i
tell
you
what
you
borrow
that
fifty
cents
you
found
and
then
you
can
pay
me
cents
and
and
he
hesitated
perhaps
you
will
find
some
more
or
hughie
eyes
were
blazing
with
great
fierceness
foxy
hastened
to
add
and
i
let
you
have
the
pistol
right
off
and
you
pay
me
again
some
time
when
you
can
the
other
hughie
checked
the
indignant
answer
that
was
at
his
lips
to
have
the
pistol
as
his
own
to
take
home
with
him
at
night
and
to
keep
all
saturday
the
temptation
was
great
and
coming
suddenly
upon
hughie
was
too
much
for
him
he
would
surely
somehow
soon
pay
back
the
fifty
cents
he
argued
and
foxy
would
wait
for
the
dollar
and
yet
that
was
not
his
but
his
mother
and
more
than
that
if
he
asked
her
for
it
he
was
pretty
sure
she
would
refuse
but
then
he
doubted
his
mother
judgment
as
to
his
ability
to
use
firearms
and
besides
this
pistol
at
that
price
was
a
great
bargain
and
any
of
the
boys
might
pick
it
up
poor
hughie
he
did
not
know
how
ancient
was
that
argument
nor
how
frequently
it
had
done
duty
in
smoothing
the
descent
to
the
lower
regions
the
pistol
was
good
to
look
at
the
opportunity
of
securing
it
was
such
as
might
not
occur
again
and
as
for
the
there
could
be
no
harm
in
borrowing
that
for
a
little
while
that
was
foxy
day
of
triumph
but
to
hughie
it
was
the
beginning
of
many
woeful
days
and
nights
and
his
misery
came
upon
him
swift
and
sure
in
the
very
moment
that
he
turned
in
from
the
road
at
the
manse
gate
for
he
knew
that
at
the
end
of
the
lane
would
be
his
mother
and
his
winged
feet
upon
which
he
usually
flew
from
the
gate
home
dragged
heavily
he
found
his
mother
not
at
the
door
but
in
the
large
pleasant
which
did
for
all
kinds
of
rooms
in
the
manse
it
was
and
nursery
and
playroom
but
it
was
always
a
good
room
to
enter
and
in
spite
of
playthings
strewn
about
or
snippings
of
cloth
or
other
stour
it
was
always
a
place
of
brightness
and
of
peace
for
it
was
there
the
mother
was
most
frequently
to
be
found
this
evening
she
was
at
the
busy
with
sunday
clothes
with
the
baby
asleep
in
the
cradle
beside
her
in
spite
of
the
din
of
the
flying
wheels
and
little
robbie
helping
to
pull
through
the
long
seam
hughie
shrank
from
the
warm
bright
loving
atmosphere
that
seemed
to
fill
the
room
hating
to
go
in
but
in
a
moment
he
realized
that
he
must
make
believe
with
his
mother
and
the
pain
of
it
and
the
shame
of
it
startled
and
amazed
him
he
was
glad
that
his
mother
did
not
notice
him
enter
and
by
the
time
he
had
put
away
his
books
he
had
braced
himself
to
meet
her
bright
smile
and
her
welcome
kiss
the
mother
did
not
apparently
notice
his
hesitation
well
my
boy
home
again
she
cried
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
with
the
air
of
good
comradeship
she
always
wore
with
him
are
you
very
hungry
you
bet
said
hughie
kissing
her
and
glad
of
the
chance
to
get
away
well
you
will
find
something
pretty
nice
in
the
pantry
we
saved
for
you
guess
do
i
know
shouted
robbie
pie
it
muzzie
pie
muzzie
tept
it
for
now
robbie
you
were
not
to
tell
said
his
mother
shaking
her
finger
at
him
i
fordot
said
robbie
horrified
at
his
failure
to
keep
his
promise
never
mind
that
a
lesson
you
will
have
to
learn
many
times
how
to
keep
those
little
lips
shut
and
the
pie
will
be
just
as
thank
you
mother
said
hughie
but
i
do
want
your
my
pie
said
the
mother
pie
is
good
for
old
old
women
said
hughie
indignantly
you
the
youngest
and
prettiest
woman
in
the
congregation
he
cried
and
forgetting
for
the
moment
his
sense
of
meanness
he
threw
his
arms
round
his
mother
oh
hughie
shame
on
you
what
a
dreadful
flatterer
you
are
said
his
mother
now
run
away
to
your
pie
and
then
to
your
evening
work
my
boy
and
we
will
have
a
good
lesson
together
after
hughie
ran
away
glad
to
get
out
of
her
presence
and
seizing
the
pie
carried
it
out
to
the
barn
and
hurled
it
far
into
the
snow
he
felt
sure
that
a
single
bite
of
it
would
choke
him
if
he
could
only
have
seen
foxy
any
time
for
the
next
hour
how
gladly
would
he
have
given
him
back
his
pistol
but
by
the
time
he
had
fed
his
cow
and
the
horses
split
the
wood
and
carried
it
in
and
prepared
kindling
for
the
morning
fires
he
had
become
accustomed
to
his
new
self
and
had
learned
his
first
lesson
in
keeping
his
emotions
out
of
his
face
but
from
that
night
and
through
all
the
long
weeks
of
the
breaking
winter
when
games
in
the
woods
were
impossible
by
reason
of
the
snow
and
water
and
when
the
roads
were
deep
with
mud
hughie
carried
his
burden
with
him
till
life
was
one
long
weariness
and
dread
and
through
these
days
he
was
foxy
slave
a
pistol
without
ammunition
was
quite
useless
foxy
stock
was
near
at
hand
it
was
easy
to
write
a
voucher
for
a
penny
worth
of
powder
or
caps
and
consequently
the
pile
in
foxy
steadily
mounted
till
hughie
was
afraid
to
look
at
it
his
chance
of
being
free
from
his
own
conscience
was
still
remote
enough
during
these
days
too
foxy
reveled
in
his
power
over
his
rival
and
ground
his
slave
in
bitter
bondage
subjecting
him
to
such
humiliation
as
made
the
school
wonder
and
hughie
writhe
and
if
ever
hughie
showed
any
sign
of
resentment
or
rebellion
foxy
could
tame
him
to
groveling
submission
by
a
single
word
well
i
guess
i
go
down
to
see
your
mother
was
all
he
needed
to
say
to
make
hughie
grovel
again
for
with
hughie
it
was
not
the
fear
of
his
father
wrath
and
heavy
punishment
though
that
was
terrible
enough
but
the
dread
that
his
mother
should
know
that
made
him
grovel
before
his
tyrant
and
wake
at
night
in
a
cold
sweat
his
mother
tender
anxiety
for
his
pale
face
and
gloomy
looks
only
added
to
the
misery
of
his
heart
he
had
no
one
in
whom
he
could
confide
he
could
not
tell
any
of
the
boys
for
he
was
unwilling
to
lose
their
esteem
besides
it
was
none
of
their
business
he
was
terrified
of
his
father
wrath
and
from
his
mother
his
usual
and
unfailing
resort
in
every
trouble
of
his
whole
life
he
was
now
separated
by
his
terrible
secret
then
foxy
began
to
insist
upon
payment
of
his
debts
spring
was
at
hand
the
store
would
soon
be
closed
up
for
business
was
slack
in
the
summer
and
besides
foxy
had
other
use
for
his
money
have
you
got
any
money
at
all
in
your
house
foxy
sneered
one
day
when
hughie
was
declaring
his
inability
to
meet
his
debts
of
course
we
have
cried
hughie
indignantly
do
believe
it
said
foxy
contemptuously
father
drawer
is
sometimes
full
of
dimes
and
at
least
there
an
awful
lot
on
mondays
from
the
collections
you
know
said
hughie
well
then
you
had
better
get
some
for
me
somehow
said
foxy
you
might
borrow
some
from
the
drawer
for
a
little
that
would
be
stealing
said
hughie
you
would
mean
to
keep
it
said
foxy
you
would
only
take
it
for
a
while
it
would
just
be
it
would
said
hughie
firmly
it
taking
out
of
his
drawer
stealing
and
i
wo
huh
you
mighty
good
all
at
once
what
about
that
you
said
yourself
that
was
stealing
said
hughie
passionately
well
what
the
difference
you
said
it
was
your
mother
and
this
is
your
father
it
all
the
same
except
that
you
afraid
to
take
your
i
not
afraid
at
least
it
is
that
but
it
different
to
take
money
out
of
a
drawer
that
is
your
huh
mighty
lot
of
difference
money
money
wherever
it
is
besides
if
you
borrowed
this
from
your
father
you
could
pay
back
your
mother
and
me
you
would
pay
the
whole
thing
right
once
more
hughie
argued
with
himself
to
be
free
from
foxy
hateful
tyranny
and
to
be
clear
again
with
his
mother
for
that
he
would
be
willing
to
suffer
almost
anything
but
to
take
money
out
of
that
drawer
was
awfully
like
stealing
of
course
he
would
pay
it
back
and
after
all
it
would
only
be
borrowing
besides
it
would
enable
him
to
repay
what
he
owed
to
his
mother
and
to
foxy
through
all
the
mazes
of
specious
argument
hughie
worked
his
way
arriving
at
no
conclusion
except
that
he
carried
with
him
a
feeling
that
if
he
could
by
some
means
get
that
money
out
of
the
drawer
in
a
way
that
would
not
be
stealing
it
would
be
a
vast
relief
greater
than
words
could
tell
that
night
brought
him
the
opportunity
his
father
and
mother
were
away
at
the
prayer
meeting
there
was
only
jessie
left
in
the
house
and
she
was
busy
with
the
younger
children
with
the
firm
resolve
that
he
would
not
take
a
single
from
his
father
drawer
he
went
into
the
study
he
would
like
to
see
if
the
drawer
were
open
yes
it
was
open
and
the
sabbath
collection
lay
there
with
all
its
shining
invitation
he
tried
making
up
the
dollar
and
a
half
out
of
the
dimes
and
what
a
lot
of
it
took
but
when
he
used
the
quarters
and
dimes
how
much
smaller
the
piles
were
only
two
quarters
and
five
dimes
made
up
the
dollar
and
the
pile
in
the
drawer
looked
pretty
much
the
same
as
before
another
withdrawn
from
the
drawer
made
little
difference
he
looked
at
the
little
heaps
on
the
table
he
believed
he
could
make
foxy
take
that
for
his
whole
debt
though
he
was
sure
he
owed
him
more
perhaps
he
had
better
make
certain
he
transferred
two
more
dimes
and
a
from
the
drawer
to
the
table
it
was
an
insignificant
little
heap
that
would
certainly
clear
off
his
whole
indebtedness
and
make
him
a
free
man
he
slipped
the
little
heaps
of
money
from
the
table
into
his
pocket
and
then
suddenly
he
realized
that
he
had
never
decided
to
take
the
money
the
last
resolve
he
could
remember
making
was
simply
to
see
how
the
dollar
and
a
half
looked
without
noticing
he
had
passed
the
point
of
final
decision
alas
like
many
another
hughie
found
the
going
easy
and
the
slipping
smooth
upon
the
down
incline
unconsciously
he
had
slipped
into
being
a
thief
now
he
could
not
go
back
his
absorbing
purpose
was
concealment
quietly
shutting
the
drawer
he
was
slipping
hurriedly
up
to
his
own
room
when
on
the
stairway
he
met
jessie
what
are
you
doing
here
jessie
he
asked
sharply
putting
robbie
off
to
bed
said
jessie
in
surprise
what
the
matter
with
you
what
the
matter
echoed
hughie
smitten
with
horrible
fear
that
perhaps
she
knew
i
just
wanted
to
know
he
said
weakly
he
slipped
past
her
holding
his
pocket
tight
lest
the
coins
should
rattle
when
he
reached
his
room
he
stood
listening
in
the
dark
to
jessie
going
down
the
stairs
he
was
sure
she
suspected
something
he
would
go
back
and
put
the
money
in
the
drawer
again
whenever
she
reached
the
kitchen
he
stood
there
with
his
filling
his
ears
waiting
for
the
kitchen
door
to
slam
then
he
resolved
he
would
wrap
the
money
up
in
paper
and
put
it
safely
away
and
go
down
and
see
if
jessie
knew
he
found
one
of
his
old
copybooks
and
began
tearing
out
a
leaf
what
a
noise
it
made
robbie
would
surely
wake
up
and
then
jessie
would
come
back
with
the
light
he
put
the
under
the
quilt
and
holding
it
down
firmly
with
one
hand
removed
the
leaf
with
the
other
with
great
care
he
wrapped
up
the
dimes
and
by
themselves
they
fitted
better
together
then
he
took
up
the
quarters
and
was
proceeding
to
fold
them
in
a
similar
parcel
when
he
heard
jessie
voice
from
below
hughie
what
are
you
doing
she
was
coming
up
the
stair
he
jumped
from
the
bed
to
go
to
meet
her
a
quarter
fell
on
the
floor
and
rolled
under
the
bed
it
seemed
to
hughie
as
if
it
would
never
stop
rolling
and
as
if
jessie
must
hear
it
wildly
he
scrambled
on
the
floor
in
the
dark
seeking
for
the
quarter
while
jessie
came
nearer
and
nearer
are
you
going
to
bed
already
hughie
she
asked
quickly
hughie
went
out
to
the
hall
to
meet
her
yes
he
yawned
gratefully
seizing
upon
her
suggestion
i
awfully
sleepy
give
me
the
candle
jessie
he
said
snatching
it
from
her
hand
i
want
to
go
hughie
you
are
very
rude
what
would
your
mother
say
let
me
have
the
candle

hughie
heart
stood
still
i
throw

just
a
leave

candle
with

insisted
jessie
there
another
on
the
table

minute
said
hughie
hurrying
downstairs

you
come
back
here
the
rude
boy
that
you
are
said
jessie
crossly
and
bring
me
that
there
was
no
reply
hughie
was
standing
pale
and
shaking
in
the
listening
intently
for
jessie
step
would
she
go
into
his
room
or
would
she
come
down
every
moment
increased
the
agony
of
his
fear
at
length
with
a
happy
inspiration
he
went
to
the
cupboard
opened
the
door
noisily
and
began
rattling
the
dishes
mercy
me
he
heard
jessie
exclaim
at
the
top
of
the
stair
that
boy
will
be
my
death
hughie
she
called
just
shut
that
cupboard
you
know
your
mother
does
like
you
to
go
in
i
only
want
a
little
called
out
hughie
still
moving
the
dishes
and
hearing
to
his
great
relief
jessie
descending
step
in
desperation
he
seized
a
dish
of
black
currant
preserves
which
he
found
on
the
cupboard
shelf
and
spilled
it
over
the
dishes
and
upon
the
floor
just
as
jessie
entered
the
room
land
sakes
alive
boy
will
you
never
be
done
your
mischief
she
cried
rushing
toward
him
oh
he
said
i
spilt
spilt
it
echoed
jessie
indignantly
you
need
be
telling
me
that
bring
me
a
cloth
from
the
i
do
know
where
it
is
jessie
cried
hughie
slipping
upstairs
again
with
his
candle
to
his
great
relief
he
saw
that
jessie
attention
was
so
entirely
taken
up
with
removing
the
stains
of
the
preserves
from
the
cupboard
shelves
and
dishes
that
she
for
the
moment
forgot
everything
else
stockings
included
hurrying
to
his
room
and
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
lest
the
light
should
waken
his
little
brother
he
hastily
seized
the
money
upon
the
bed
quilt
and
after
a
few
moments
searching
under
the
bed
found
the
strayed
quarter
with
these
in
his
hand
he
passed
into
his
mother
room
leaving
the
candle
there
he
came
back
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
listened
for
a
moment
with
great
satisfaction
to
jessie
muttering
to
herself
while
she
cleaned
up
the
mess
he
had
made
then
he
turned
and
with
trembling
fingers
he
swiftly
made
up
the
into
another
parcel
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
he
put
the
two
parcels
in
his
pocket
and
seizing
his
candle
turned
to
leave
the
room
as
he
did
so
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
glass
with
a
great
shock
of
surprise
he
stood
gazing
at
the
terrified
white
face
with
the
staring
eyes
what
a
fool
i
am
he
said
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
nobody
will
know
and
i
pay
this
back
his
eyes
wandered
to
a
picture
which
stood
on
a
little
shelf
beside
the
glass
it
was
a
picture
of
his
mother
the
one
he
loved
best
of
all
he
had
ever
seen
of
her
there
was
a
sudden
stab
of
pain
at
his
heart
his
breath
came
in
a
great
sob
for
a
moment
he
looked
into
the
eyes
that
looked
back
at
him
so
full
of
love
and
reproach
i
wo
do
it
he
said
grinding
his
teeth
hard
and
forthwith
turned
to
go
to
his
father
study
but
as
he
left
the
room
he
saw
jessie
up
the
stairs
what
are
you
doing
now
she
cried
wrathfully
up
to
some
mischief
i
with
a
sudden
inexplicable
rage
hughie
turned
toward
her
it
none
of
your
business
you
mind
your
own
business
will
you
and
leave
me
the
terrible
emotions
of
the
last
few
minutes
were
at
the
back
of
his
rage
just
wait
you
said
jessie
till
your
mother
comes
then
you
hear
you
shut
your
mouth
cried
hughie
his
passion
sweeping
his
whole
being
like
a
tempest
you
shut
your
mouth
you
old
cat
or
i
throw
this
candle
at
he
raised
the
candle
high
in
his
hand
as
he
spoke
and
altogether
looked
so
desperate
that
jessie
stood
in
terror
lest
he
should
make
good
his
threat
stop
now
hughie
she
entreated
you
will
be
setting
the
house
on
hughie
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
turned
from
her
and
going
into
his
room
banged
the
door
in
her
face
and
jessie
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
all
went
slowly
downstairs
again
forgetting
once
more
stockings
the
old
cat
said
hughie
to
himself
she
just
stopped
me
i
was
going
to
put
it
the
memory
that
he
had
resolved
to
undo
his
wrong
brought
him
a
curious
sense
of
relief
i
was
just
going
to
put
it
back
he
said
when
she
had
to
he
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
injury
against
jessie
it
was
not
his
fault
that
that
money
was
not
now
in
the
drawer
i
put
it
back
in
the
morning
anyhow
he
said
firmly
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
was
conscious
of
an
infinality
in
his
determination
while
he
refused
to
acknowledge
to
himself
a
secret
purpose
to
leave
the
question
open
till
the
morning
but
this
determination
inconclusive
though
it
was
brought
him
a
certain
calm
of
mind
so
that
when
his
mother
came
into
his
room
she
found
him
sound
asleep
she
stood
beside
his
bed
looking
down
upon
him
for
a
few
moments
with
face
full
of
anxious
sadness
there
something
wrong
with
the
boy
she
said
to
herself
stooping
to
kiss
him
there
something
wrong
with
him
she
repeated
as
she
left
the
room
he
not
the
during
these
weeks
she
had
been
conscious
that
hughie
had
changed
in
some
way
to
her
the
old
full
frank
confidence
was
gone
there
was
a
constraint
in
his
manner
she
could
not
explain
he
is
no
longer
a
child
she
would
say
to
herself
seeking
to
allay
the
pain
in
her
heart
a
boy
must
have
his
secrets
it
is
foolish
in
me
to
think
anything
else
besides
he
is
not
well
he
is
growing
too
and
indeed
hughie
pale
miserable
face
gave
ground
enough
for
this
opinion
that
boy
is
not
well
she
said
to
her
husband
which
boy
hughie
she
replied
he
is
looking
miserable
and
somehow
he
is
oh
nonsense
he
eats
well
enough
and
sleeps
well
enough
said
her
husband
making
light
of
her
fears
there
something
wrong
repeated
his
wife
and
he
hates
his
well
i
do
wonder
at
that
said
her
husband
sharply
i
do
see
how
any
boy
of
spirit
could
take
much
pleasure
in
that
kind
of
a
school
the
boys
are
just
wasting
their
time
and
worse
than
that
they
have
lost
all
the
old
spirit
i
must
see
to
it
that
the
policy
of
those
trustees
is
changed
i
am
not
going
to
put
up
with
those
chits
of
girls
teaching
any
there
may
be
something
in
what
you
say
said
his
wife
sadly
but
certainly
hughie
is
always
begging
to
stay
at
home
from
and
indeed
he
might
as
well
stay
home
answered
her
husband
for
all
the
good
he
i
do
wish
we
had
a
good
man
in
charge
replied
his
wife
with
a
great
sigh
it
is
very
important
that
these
boys
should
have
a
good
strong
man
over
them
how
much
it
means
to
a
boy
at
hughie
time
of
life
but
so
few
are
willing
to
come
away
into
the
backwoods
here
for
so
small
a
suddenly
her
husband
laid
down
his
pipe
i
have
it
he
exclaimed
the
very
thing
would
this
be
the
very
thing
for
young
craven
you
remember
the
young
man
that
professor
maclauchlan
was
writing
his
wife
shook
her
head
very
decidedly
not
at
all
she
said
did
professor
maclauchlan
say
he
was
dissipated
o
just
a
little
wild
got
going
with
some
loose
companions
out
here
there
would
be
no
i
am
not
at
all
sure
of
that
said
his
wife
and
i
would
not
like
hughie
to
be
under
his
maclauchlan
says
he
is
a
young
man
of
fine
disposition
and
of
fine
parts
argued
her
husband
and
if
temptation
were
removed
from
him
he
believes
he
would
turn
out
a
good
murray
shook
her
head
doubtfully
he
is
not
the
man
to
put
hughie
under
just
what
are
we
to
do
with
hughie
replied
her
husband
he
is
getting
no
good
in
the
school
as
it
is
and
we
can
not
send
him
away
send
him
away
exclaimed
his
wife
no
no
not
a
child
like
craven
might
be
a
very
good
man
continued
her
husband
he
might
perhaps
live
with
us
i
know
you
have
more
than
enough
to
do
now
he
added
answering
her
look
of
dismay
but
he
would
be
a
great
help
to
hughie
with
his
lessons
and
might
start
him
in
his
classics
and
then
who
knows
what
you
might
make
of
the
young
murray
did
not
respond
to
her
husband
smile
but
only
replied
i
am
sure
i
wish
i
knew
what
is
the
matter
with
the
boy
and
i
wish
he
could
leave
school
for
a
o
the
boy
is
all
right
said
her
husband
impatiently
only
a
little
less
noisy
as
far
as
i
can
no
he
is
not
the
same
replied
his
wife
he
is
different
to
there
was
almost
a
cry
of
pain
in
her
voice
now
now
do
imagine
things
boys
are
full
of
notions
at
age
he
may
need
a
change
but
that
is
with
this
the
mother
tried
to
quiet
the
tumult
of
anxious
fear
and
pain
she
found
rising
in
her
heart
but
long
after
the
house
was
still
and
while
both
her
boy
and
his
father
lay
asleep
she
kept
pouring
forth
that
ancient
sacrifice
of
love
before
the
feet
of
god
chapter
ix
hughie
emancipation
hughie
rose
late
next
morning
and
the
hurry
and
rush
of
getting
off
to
school
in
time
left
him
no
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
the
little
packages
in
his
pocket
that
seemed
to
burn
and
sting
him
through
his
clothes
he
determined
to
keep
them
safe
in
his
pocket
all
day
and
put
them
back
in
the
drawer
at
night
his
mother
face
white
with
her
long
watching
and
sad
and
anxious
in
spite
of
its
brave
smile
filled
him
with
such
an
agony
of
remorse
that
hurrying
through
his
breakfast
he
snatched
a
farewell
kiss
and
then
tore
away
down
the
lane
lest
he
should
be
forced
to
confess
all
his
terrible
secret
the
first
person
who
met
him
in
the
was
foxy
have
you
got
that
was
his
salutation
a
sudden
fury
possessed
hughie
yes
you
sneaking
fox
he
answered
and
i
hope
it
will
bring
you
the
curse
of
luck
foxy
hurried
him
cautiously
behind
the
school
with
difficulty
concealing
his
delight
while
hughie
unrolled
his
little
bundles
and
counted
out
the
quarters
and
dimes
and
half
dimes
into
his
hand
there
a
dollar
and
there
a
quarter
and
and
there
another
he
added
desperately
and
god
may
kill
me
on
the
spot
if
i
give
you
any
more
all
right
hughie
said
foxy
soothingly
putting
the
money
into
his
pocket
you
need
be
so
mad
about
it
you
bought
the
pistol
and
the
rest
right
enough
did
you
i
know
i
did
but
but
you
made
me
you
big
sneaking
thief
and
then
you
hughie
voice
broke
in
his
rage
his
face
was
pale
and
his
black
eyes
were
glittering
with
fierce
fury
and
in
his
heart
he
was
conscious
of
a
wild
longing
to
fall
upon
foxy
and
tear
him
to
pieces
and
foxy
big
and
tall
as
he
was
glanced
at
hughie
face
and
saying
not
a
word
turned
and
fled
to
the
front
of
the
school
where
the
other
boys
were
hughie
followed
slowly
his
heart
still
swelling
with
furious
rage
and
full
of
an
eager
desire
to
be
at
foxy
smiling
fat
face
at
the
school
door
stood
miss
morrison
the
teacher
smiling
down
upon
foxy
who
was
looking
up
at
her
with
an
expression
of
such
sweet
innocence
that
hughie
groaned
out
between
his
clenched
teeth
oh
you
devil
you
some
day
i
make
you
smile
out
of
the
other
side
of
your
big
fat
who
are
you
swearing
at
it
was
fusie
oh
fusie
cried
hughie
let
get
davie
and
get
into
the
woods
not
going
in
i
hate
the
beastly
place
and
the
whole
gang
of
fusie
the
little
french
waif
was
ready
for
anything
in
the
way
of
adventure
to
him
anything
was
better
than
the
even
monotony
of
the
school
routine
true
it
might
mean
a
whipping
both
from
the
teacher
and
from
mcleod
but
as
to
the
teacher
whipping
fusie
was
prepared
to
stand
that
for
a
free
day
in
the
woods
and
as
to
the
other
fusie
declared
that
mcleod
whipping
would
hurt
a
to
davie
scotch
however
playing
truant
was
a
serious
matter
he
had
been
reared
in
an
atmosphere
of
reverence
for
established
law
and
order
but
when
hughie
gave
command
to
davie
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
the
three
boys
watched
till
the
school
was
called
and
then
crawling
along
on
their
stomachs
behind
the
heavy
fence
they
slipped
into
the
balsam
thicket
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
were
safe
here
they
flung
down
their
schoolbags
and
lying
prone
upon
the
fragrant
bed
of
strewn
thickly
upon
the
moss
they
peered
out
through
the
balsam
boughs
at
the
house
of
their
bondage
with
an
exultant
sense
of
freedom
and
a
feeling
of
pity
if
not
of
contempt
for
the
unhappy
and
spiritless
creatures
who
were
content
to
be
penned
inside
any
house
on
such
a
day
as
this
and
with
such
a
world
outside
for
some
minutes
they
rolled
about
upon
the
soft
moss
and
and
the
brown
leaves
of
last
year
till
their
hearts
were
running
over
with
a
deep
and
satisfying
delight
it
is
hard
to
resist
the
ministry
of
the
woods
the
sympathetic
silence
of
the
trees
the
aromatic
airs
that
breathe
through
the
shady
spaces
the
soft
mingling
of
broken
lights
these
all
combine
to
lay
upon
the
spirit
a
soothing
balm
and
bring
to
the
heart
peace
and
hughie
sensitive
at
every
pore
to
that
soothing
ministry
before
long
forgot
for
a
time
even
foxy
with
his
fat
white
face
and
smiling
mouth
and
lying
on
the
broad
of
his
back
and
looking
up
at
the
blue
sky
through
the
interlacing
branches
and
leaves
he
began
to
feel
again
that
it
was
good
to
be
alive
and
that
with
all
his
misery
there
were
compensations
but
any
lengthened
period
of
peaceful
calm
is
not
for
boys
of
the
age
and
spirit
of
hughie
and
his
companions
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
fusie
the
man
of
adventure
do
nothing
said
hughie
from
his
supine
position
this
is
good
enough
for
not
me
said
fusie
starting
to
climb
a
tall
lithe
birch
while
hughie
lazily
watched
him
soon
fusie
was
at
the
top
of
the
birch
which
began
to
sway
dangerously
try
to
fly
into
that
balsam
cried
hughie
no
sir
yes
go
ca
do
oh
pshaw
you
no
nor
you
either
that
a
mighty
big
come
on
down
then
and
let
me
try
said
hughie
in
scorn
his
laziness
was
gone
in
the
presence
of
a
possible
achievement
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
taken
fusie
place
a
the
top
of
the
swaying
birch
it
did
not
look
so
easy
from
the
top
of
the
birch
as
from
the
ground
to
swing
into
the
however
he
could
not
go
back
now
dinna
try
it
hughie
cried
davie
to
him
ye
no
mak
it
and
come
an
awfu
cropper
as
sure
as
but
hughie
swaying
gently
back
and
forth
was
measuring
the
distance
of
his
drop
it
was
not
a
feat
so
very
difficult
but
it
called
for
good
judgment
and
steady
nerve
a
moment
too
soon
or
a
moment
too
late
in
letting
go
would
mean
a
nasty
fall
of
twenty
feet
or
more
upon
the
solid
ground
and
one
never
knew
just
how
one
would
light
i
wudna
dae
it
hughie
urged
davie
anxiously
but
hughie
swaying
high
in
the
birch
heeded
not
the
warning
and
suddenly
swinging
out
from
the
slender
trunk
and
holding
by
his
hands
he
described
a
parabola
and
releasing
the
birch
dropped
on
to
the
balsam
top
but
are
of
uncertain
fiber
and
not
to
be
relied
upon
and
this
particular
balsam
breaking
off
short
in
hands
allowed
him
to
go
crashing
through
the
branches
to
the
earth
man
man
cried
davie
scotch
bending
over
hughie
as
he
lay
white
and
still
upon
the
ground
are

he
deid
sobbed
davie
wringing
his
hands
fusie
fusie
ye
gowk
where

gone
in
a
moment
or
two
fusie
reappeared
through
the
branches
with
a
capful
of
water
and
dashed
it
into
hughie
face
with
the
result
that
the
lad
opened
his
eyes
and
after
a
gasp
or
two
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
och
laddie
laddie

said
davie
scotch
what

matter

asked
hughie
with
a
bewildered
look
about
him
and
who

throwing
water
all
over

he
added
wrathfully
as
full
consciousness
returned

davie
joyously

hughie

the
broken
tree

said
davie
still
anxiously
hovering
about
him
dinna
rise
yet
oh
pshaw
said
hughie
and
he
struggled
to
his
feet
i
all
but
as
he
spoke
he
sank
down
upon
the
moss
saying
i
feel
kind
of
queer
lie

then

said
davie
angrily

hughie

davie
lie

there
or
i
gie

a
crack
that
mak
ye
glad
tae
keep
for
half
an
hour
the
boys
lay
on
the
moss
discussing
the
accident
fully
in
all
its
varying
aspects
and
possibilities
till
the
sound
of
wheels
came
up
the
road
who
that
fusie
asked
hughie
lazily
dunno
me
said
fusie
peering
through
the
trees
do
you
scotty
no
not
hughie
crawled
over
to
the
edge
of
the
brush
why
you
idiots
it
thomas
finch
thomas
he
called
but
thomas
drove
straight
on
in
a
moment
hughie
sprang
up
forgetting
all
about
his
weakness
and
ran
out
to
the
roadside
hello
thomas
he
cried
waving
his
hand
thomas
saw
him
stopped
and
looked
at
him
doubtfully
he
with
all
the
section
knew
how
the
school
was
going
and
he
easily
guessed
what
took
hughie
there
i
not
going
to
school
said
hughie
answering
thomas
look
thomas
nodded
and
sat
silent
waiting
he
was
not
a
man
to
waste
his
words
i
hate
the
whole
thing
exclaimed
hughie
foxy
eh
said
thomas
to
whom
on
other
occasions
hughie
had
confided
his
grievances
and
especially
those
he
suffered
at
the
hands
of
foxy
yes
foxy
cried
hughie
in
a
sudden
rage
he
a
sneak
and
the
teacher
just
makes
me
sick
thomas
still
waited
she
just
smiles
and
smiles
at
him
and
he
smiles
at
her
ugh
i
stand
not
much
harm
in
smiling
said
thomas
solemnly
oh
thomas
i
hate
the
school
i
not
going
to
go
any
thomas
looked
gravely
down
upon
hughie
passionate
face
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
you
will
do
what
your
mother
wants
you
i
hughie
said
nothing
in
reply
while
thomas
sat
pondering
finally
he
said
with
a
sudden
inspiration
hughie
come
along
with
me
and
help
me
with
the
they
wo
let
me
grumbled
hughie
at
least
father
wo
i
like
to
ask
thomas
eyes
opened
in
surprise
this
was
a
new
thing
in
hughie
i
ask
your
mother
he
said
at
length
get
in
with
me
still
hughie
hesitated
to
get
away
from
school
was
joy
enough
to
go
with
thomas
to
the
potato
planting
was
more
than
could
be
hoped
for
but
still
he
stood
making
pictures
in
the
dust
with
his
bare
toes
there
fusie
he
said
and
davie
well
said
thomas
catching
sight
of
those
worthies
through
the
trees
let
them
come
fusie
was
promptly
willing
but
davie
was
doubtful
he
certainly
would
not
go
to
the
manse
where
he
might
meet
the
minister
and
meeting
the
minister
wife
under
the
present
circumstances
was
a
little
worse
well
you
can
wait
at
the
gate
with
fusie
suggested
hughie
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
fortunately
for
hughie
his
father
was
not
at
home
but
not
earnest
entreaties
nor
hughie
eager
pleading
would
have
availed
with
the
mother
for
attendance
at
school
was
a
sacred
duty
in
her
eyes
had
it
not
been
that
her
boy
face
paler
than
usual
and
with
the
dawning
of
a
new
defiance
in
it
startled
her
and
confirmed
in
her
the
fear
that
all
was
not
well
with
him
well
thomas
he
may
go
with
you
to
the
cameron
for
the
potatoes
but
as
to
going
with
you
to
the
planting
that
is
another
thing
your
mother
is
not
fit
to
be
troubled
with
another
boy
and
especially
a
boy
like
hughie
and
how
is
she
thomas
continued
murray
as
thomas
stood
in
dull
silence
before
her
she
better
said
thomas
answering
more
quickly
than
usual
and
with
a
certain
eagerness
in
his
voice
she
a
great
deal
better
and
hughie
will
do
her
no
harm
but
murray
looked
at
thomas
as
he
spoke
wondering
at
the
change
in
his
voice
and
manner
the
heavy
stolid
face
had
changed
since
she
had
last
seen
it
it
was
finer
keener
than
before
the
eyes
so
often
dull
were
lighted
up
with
a
new
strange
fire
she
much
better
said
thomas
again
as
if
insisting
against
murray
unbelief
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
thomas
she
said
gently
she
will
soon
be
quite
well
again
i
hope
for
she
has
had
a
long
long
time
of
yes
a
long
long
time
replied
thomas
his
face
was
pale
and
in
his
eyes
was
a
look
of
pain
almost
of
fear
and
you
will
come
to
see
her
soon
he
added
there
was
almost
a
piteous
entreaty
in
his
tone
yes
thomas
surely
next
week
and
meantime
i
shall
let
hughie
go
with
a
look
of
such
utter
devotion
poured
itself
into
thomas
eyes
that
murray
was
greatly
moved
and
putting
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
she
said
gently
will
give
his
angels
charge
do
be
afraid
afraid
said
thomas
with
a
kind
of
gasp
his
face
going
white
afraid
no
why
but
murray
turned
from
him
to
hide
the
tears
that
she
could
not
keep
out
of
her
eyes
for
she
knew
what
was
before
thomas
and
them
all
meantime
hughie
was
busy
putting
into
his
little
what
he
considered
the
necessary
equipment
for
his
visit
you
must
wear
your
shoes
oh
mother
shoes
are
such
an
awful
bother
planting
potatoes
they
get
full
of
ground
and
well
put
them
in
your
bag
at
any
rate
and
your
stockings
too
you
may
need
by
degrees
hughie
very
moderate
necessities
were
satisfied
and
with
a
hurried
farewell
to
his
mother
he
went
off
with
thomas
at
the
gate
they
picked
up
fusie
and
davie
scotch
and
went
off
to
the
cameron
for
the
seed
potatoes
hughie
heart
lighter
than
it
had
been
for
many
a
day
and
all
through
the
afternoon
and
as
he
drove
home
with
thomas
on
the
loaded
bags
his
heart
kept
singing
back
to
the
birds
in
the
trees
overhead
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
drove
into
the
yard
for
the
roads
were
still
bad
in
the
swamp
where
the
corduroy
had
been
broken
up
by
the
spring
floods
thomas
hurried
through
unhitching
and
without
waiting
to
unharness
he
stood
the
horses
in
their
stalls
saying
we
may
need
them
this
afternoon
again
and
took
hughie
off
to
the
house
the
usual
beautiful
order
pervaded
the
house
and
its
surroundings
the
back
yard
through
which
the
boys
came
from
the
barn
was
free
of
litter
the
chips
were
raked
into
neat
little
piles
close
to
the
for
summer
use
on
a
bench
beside
the
stoop
door
was
a
row
of
lapping
each
other
like
scales
on
a
fish
glittering
in
the
sun
the
large
summer
kitchen
with
its
spotless
floor
and
walls
stood
with
both
its
doors
open
to
the
sweet
air
that
came
in
from
the
fields
above
and
was
as
pleasant
a
room
to
look
in
upon
as
one
could
desire
on
the
sill
of
the
open
window
stood
a
geranium
and
a
tall
fuschia
with
white
and
crimson
blossoms
hanging
in
clusters
bunches
of
wild
flowers
stood
on
the
table
on
the
dresser
and
up
beside
the
clock
and
the
whole
room
breathed
of
sweet
scents
of
fields
and
flowers
and
the
name
of
the
chamber
was
beside
the
open
window
sat
the
little
mother
in
an
the
embodiment
of
all
the
peaceful
beauty
and
sweet
fragrance
of
the
room
well
mother
said
thomas
crossing
the
floor
to
her
and
laying
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
have
i
been
long
away
i
have
brought
hughie
back
with
me
you
not
so
very
long
thomas
said
the
mother
her
dark
face
lighting
with
a
look
of
love
as
she
glanced
up
at
her
big
son
and
i
am
glad
to
see
hughie
he
will
excuse
me
from
rising
she
added
with
fine
courtesy
hughie
hurried
toward
her
yes
indeed
finch
do
think
of
but
he
could
get
no
further
boy
as
he
was
and
at
the
age
when
boys
are
most
heartless
and
regardless
he
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
lip
and
his
voice
steady
and
to
swallow
the
lump
in
his
throat
and
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
his
eyes
were
filling
up
with
tears
as
he
looked
into
the
little
woman
face
so
worn
and
weary
so
pathetically
bright
it
was
months
since
he
had
seen
her
and
during
these
months
a
great
change
had
come
to
her
and
to
the
finch
household
after
suffering
long
in
secret
the
mother
had
been
forced
to
confess
to
a
severe
pain
in
her
breast
and
under
her
arm
upon
examination
the
doctor
pronounced
the
case
to
be
malignant
cancer
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
removal
it
was
what
grant
called
a
very
beautiful
operation
indeed
and
now
she
was
recovering
her
strength
but
only
slowly
so
slowly
that
thomas
at
times
found
his
heart
sink
with
a
vague
fear
but
it
was
not
the
pain
of
the
wound
that
had
wrought
that
sweet
pathetic
look
into
the
little
woman
face
but
the
deeper
pain
she
carried
in
her
heart
for
those
she
loved
better
than
herself
the
mother
sickness
brought
many
changes
into
the
household
but
the
most
striking
of
all
the
changes
was
that
wrought
in
the
slow
and
stolid
thomas
the
father
and
billy
jack
were
busy
with
the
farm
matters
outside
upon
little
jessac
now
a
girl
of
twelve
years
fell
the
care
of
the
house
but
it
was
thomas
that
with
the
assistance
of
a
neighbor
at
first
but
afterwards
alone
waited
on
his
mother
dressing
the
wound
and
nursing
her
these
weeks
of
watching
and
nursing
had
wrought
in
him
the
subtle
change
that
stirred
murray
heart
as
she
looked
at
him
that
day
and
that
made
even
hughie
wonder
for
one
thing
his
tongue
was
loosed
and
thomas
talked
to
his
mother
of
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
on
the
way
to
the
cameron
and
back
making
much
of
his
little
visit
to
the
manse
and
of
murray
kindness
and
enlarging
upon
her
promised
visit
and
all
with
such
brightness
and
picturesqueness
of
speech
that
hughie
listened
amazed
for
all
the
years
he
had
known
thomas
he
had
never
heard
from
his
lips
so
many
words
as
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
talk
with
his
mother
then
too
thomas
seemed
to
have
found
his
fingers
for
no
woman
could
have
arranged
more
deftly
and
with
gentler
touch
the
cushions
at
his
mother
back
and
no
nurse
could
have
measured
out
the
medicine
and
prepared
her
with
greater
skill
hughie
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
and
ears
was
this
thomas
the
stolid
the
clumsy
the
this
big
fellow
with
the
quick
tongue
and
the
clever
gentle
hand
meantime
jessac
had
set
upon
the
table
a
large
pitcher
of
rich
milk
with
oat
cakes
and
butter
and
honey
in
the
comb
now
hughie
lad
draw
in
and
help
yourself
you
and
thomas
will
be
too
hungry
to
wait
for
supper
said
the
mother
and
hughie
protesting
politely
that
he
was
not
very
hungry
proceeded
to
establish
the
contrary
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
himself
and
the
others
now
thomas
said
the
mother
we
had
better
cut
the
indeed
and
not
a
seed
will
you
cut
mother
said
thomas
emphatically
you
may
boss
the
job
though
i
bring
the
potatoes
to
the
back
and
this
he
did
thinking
it
no
trouble
to
hitch
up
the
team
to
draw
the
wagon
into
the
back
yard
so
that
his
mother
might
have
a
part
in
the
cutting
of
the
seed
potatoes
as
she
had
had
every
year
of
her
life
on
the
farm
very
carefully
and
in
spite
of
her
protests
that
she
could
walk
quite
well
thomas
carried
his
mother
out
to
her
chair
in
the
shade
of
the
house
arranging
with
tender
solicitude
the
pillows
at
her
back
and
the
rug
at
her
feet
then
they
set
to
work
at
the
potatoes
mind
you
have
two
eyes
in
every
seed
hughie
said
jessac
severely
huh
i
know
i
cut
them
often
enough
replied
hughie
scornfully
well
look
at
that
one
now
said
jessac
picking
up
a
seed
that
hughie
had
let
fall
that
only
got
one
there
two
said
hughie
triumphantly
that
not
an
eye
said
jessac
pointing
to
a
mark
on
the
potato
that
where
the
top
grew
out
of
is
it
mother
it
is
is
it
appealed
hughie
finch
took
the
seed
and
looked
at
it
well
there
one
very
good
eye
and
that
will
but
is
that
the
mark
of
the
top
mother
insisted
jessac
but
the
mother
only
shook
her
head
at
her
that
right
jessac
said
thomas
driving
off
with
his
team
you
look
after
hughie
and
mother
will
look
after
you
both
till
i
get
back
and
there
be
a
grand
crop
this
it
was
a
happy
hour
for
them
all
the
slanting
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
filled
the
air
with
a
genial
warmth
a
little
breeze
bore
from
the
orchard
near
by
a
fragrance
of
a
matronly
hen
tethered
by
the
leg
to
her
coop
raised
indignant
protest
against
the
outrage
on
her
personal
liberty
or
clucked
and
crooned
her
invitations
counsels
warnings
and
encouragements
in
as
many
different
tones
to
her
independent
fluffy
brood
of
chicks
while
a
huge
gobbler
strutted
up
and
down
thrilling
with
pride
in
the
glossy
magnificence
of
his
outspread
tail
and
pompous
mighty
chest
hughie
was
conscious
of
a
deep
and
grateful
content
but
across
his
content
lay
a
shadow
if
only
that
would
lift
as
he
watched
thomas
with
his
mother
he
realized
how
far
he
had
drifted
from
his
own
mother
and
he
thought
with
regret
of
the
happy
days
which
now
seemed
so
far
in
the
past
when
his
mother
had
shared
his
every
secret
but
for
him
those
days
could
never
come
again
at
supper
hughie
was
aware
of
some
subtle
difference
in
the
spirit
of
the
home
as
to
thomas
so
to
his
father
a
change
had
come
the
old
man
was
as
silent
as
ever
indeed
more
so
but
there
was
no
asperity
in
his
silence
his
critical
captious
manner
was
gone
his
silence
was
that
of
a
great
sorrow
and
of
a
great
fear
while
there
was
more
cheerful
conversation
than
ever
at
the
table
there
was
through
all
a
new
respect
and
a
certain
tender
consideration
shown
toward
the
silent
old
man
at
the
head
and
all
joined
in
an
effort
to
draw
him
from
his
gloom
the
past
months
of
his
wife
suffering
had
bowed
him
as
with
the
weight
of
years
even
hughie
could
note
this
after
supper
the
old
man
took
the
books
as
usual
but
when
as
high
priest
he
ascended
the
mount
of
ordinances
to
offer
the
evening
sacrifice
he
was
as
a
man
walking
in
thick
darkness
bewildered
and
afraid
the
prayer
was
largely
a
meditation
on
the
heinousness
of
sin
and
the
righteous
judgments
of
god
and
closed
with
an
exaltation
of
the
cross
with
an
appeal
that
the
innocent
might
be
spared
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
the
conviction
had
settled
in
the
old
man
mind
that
the
lord
was
visiting
upon
him
and
his
family
his
sins
his
pride
his
censoriousness
his
hardness
of
the
words
of
his
prayer
fell
meaningless
upon
hughie
english
ears
but
the
boy
heart
quivered
in
response
to
the
agony
of
entreaty
in
the
pleading
tones
and
he
rose
from
his
knees
awed
and
subdued
there
was
no
word
spoken
for
some
moments
after
the
prayer
with
people
like
the
finches
it
was
considered
to
be
an
insult
to
the
almighty
to
depart
from
the
presence
with
any
unseemly
haste
then
thomas
came
to
help
his
mother
to
her
room
but
she
with
her
eyes
upon
her
husband
quietly
put
thomas
aside
and
said
donald
will
you
tak
me
ben
rarely
had
she
called
him
by
his
name
before
the
family
and
all
felt
that
this
was
a
most
unusual
demonstration
of
tenderness
on
her
part
the
old
man
glanced
quickly
at
her
from
under
his
overhanging
eyebrows
and
met
her
bright
upward
look
with
an
involuntary
shake
of
the
head
and
a
slight
sigh
comfort
was
not
for
him
and
he
must
not
delude
himself
but
with
a
little
laugh
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
as
if
administering
reproof
to
a
little
child
she
said
some
words
in
gaelic
oh
woman
woman
said
donald
in
reply
if
it
was
yourself
we
had
to
deal
with
whisht
man
will
you
be
putting
me
before
your
father
in
heaven
she
said
as
they
disappeared
into
the
other
room
there
was
no
fiddle
that
evening
there
was
no
heart
for
it
with
thomas
neither
was
there
time
for
there
was
the
milking
to
do
and
the
sorting
of
the
pails
and
pans
and
the
preparing
for
churning
in
the
morning
so
that
when
all
was
done
the
long
evening
had
faded
into
the
twilight
and
it
was
time
for
bed
before
going
upstairs
thomas
took
hughie
into
the
room
where
his
mother
bed
had
been
placed
thomas
gave
her
her
medicine
and
made
her
comfortable
for
the
night
is
there
nothing
else
now
mother
he
said
still
lingering
about
her
no
thomas
my
man
how
are
the
cows
doing
grand
blossom
filled
a
pail
and
spotty
almost
twice
she
a
great
milker
yes
and
so
was
her
mother
i
remember
she
used
to
fill
two
pails
when
the
grass
was
i
remember
her
too
her
horns
curled
right
back
did
they
and
she
always
looked
so
yes
but
she
was
a
kindly
cow
and
will
the
churn
be
ready
for
the
morning
yes
mother
we
have
buttermilk
for
our
porridge
sure
well
you
need
to
be
up
early
for
that
too
early
thomas
lad
for
a
boy
like
a
boy
like
me
said
thomas
feigning
indignation
and
stretching
himself
to
his
full
height
where
would
you
be
getting
your
men
mother
you
are
man
enough
laddie
said
his
mother
and
a
good
one
you
will
come
to
be
i
doubt
and
you
too
hughie
lad
she
added
turning
to
him
you
will
be
like
your
i
dunno
said
hughie
his
face
flushing
scarlet
he
was
weary
and
sick
of
his
secret
and
the
sight
of
the
loving
comradeship
between
thomas
and
his
mother
made
his
burden
all
the
heavier
what
wrong
with
yon
laddie
asked
finch
when
hughie
had
gone
away
to
bed
now
mother
you
too
sharp
altogether
and
how
do
you
know
anything
is
wrong
with
him
i
warrant
you
his
mother
sees
it
something
is
on
his
mind
hughie
is
not
the
lad
he
used
to
be
he
will
not
look
at
you
straight
and
that
is
not
like
oh
mother
you
a
sharp
one
said
thomas
i
thought
no
one
had
seen
that
but
myself
yes
there
is
something
wrong
with
him
something
in
the
school
it
a
poor
place
nowadays
anyway
and
i
wish
hughie
were
done
with
he
must
keep
at
the
school
thomas
and
i
only
wish
you
could
do
the
his
mother
sighed
she
had
her
own
secret
ambition
for
thomas
and
though
she
never
opened
her
heart
to
her
son
or
indeed
to
any
one
thomas
somehow
knew
that
it
was
her
heart
desire
to
see
him
in
the
never
you
mind
mother
he
said
brightly
it
all
come
right
are
you
always
the
one
preaching
faith
to
me
yes
laddie
and
it
is
needed
and
sorely
at
now
mither
said
thomas
dropping
into
her
native
speech
ye
mauna
be
fashin
yersel
ye
jist
say
i
lay
me
and
gang
to
sleep
like
a
ay
that
a
guid
word
laddie
an
a
tak
it
ye
may
kiss
me
guid
nicht
a
tak
thomas
bent
over
her
and
whispered
in
her
ear
ay
mither
mither
ye
an
angel
and
that
ye
hoots
laddie
gang
awa
wi
ye
said
his
mother
but
she
held
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
once
and
again
there
was
no
one
to
see
and
why
should
they
not
give
and
take
their
heart
fill
of
love
but
when
thomas
stood
outside
the
room
door
he
folded
his
arms
tight
across
his
breast
and
whispered
with
lips
that
quivered
ay
mither
mither
mither
there
nane
like
ye
there
nane
like
and
he
was
glad
that
when
he
went
upstairs
he
found
hughie
unwilling
to
talk
the
next
three
days
they
were
all
busy
with
the
planting
of
the
potatoes
and
nothing
could
have
been
better
for
hughie
the
sweet
sunny
air
and
the
kindly
wholesome
earth
and
honest
hard
work
were
life
and
health
to
mind
and
heart
and
body
it
is
wonderful
how
the
touch
of
the
kindly
mother
earth
cleanses
the
soul
from
its
unwholesome
humors
the
hours
that
hughie
spent
in
working
with
the
clean
red
earth
seemed
somehow
to
breathe
virtue
into
him
he
remembered
the
past
months
like
a
bad
dream
they
seemed
to
him
a
hideous
unreality
and
he
could
not
think
of
foxy
and
his
schemes
nor
of
his
own
weakness
in
yielding
to
temptation
without
a
horrible
he
became
aware
of
a
strange
feeling
of
sympathy
and
kinship
with
old
donald
finch
he
seemed
to
understand
his
gloom
during
those
days
their
work
brought
those
two
together
for
billy
jack
had
the
running
of
the
drills
and
to
thomas
was
intrusted
the
responsibility
of
dropping
the
potatoes
so
hughie
and
the
old
man
undertook
to
cover
after
thomas
side
by
side
they
hoed
together
speaking
not
a
word
for
an
hour
at
a
time
but
before
long
the
old
man
appeared
to
feel
the
lad
sympathy
hughie
was
quick
to
save
him
steps
and
eager
in
many
ways
to
anticipate
his
wishes
he
was
quick
too
with
the
hoe
and
ambitious
to
do
his
full
share
of
the
work
and
this
won
the
old
man
respect
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
there
was
established
between
them
a
solid
basis
of
friendship
old
donald
finch
was
no
cheerful
companion
for
hughie
but
it
was
to
hughie
a
relief
more
than
anything
else
that
he
was
not
much
with
either
thomas
or
billy
jack
you
tired
he
ventured
in
answer
to
a
deep
sigh
from
the
old
man
toward
the
close
of
the
day
no
laddie
replied
the
old
man
i
know
not
that
i
am
working
the
burden
of
toil
is
the
least
of
all
our
and
then
after
a
pause
he
added
it
is
a
terrible
thing
is
to
an
equal
in
age
the
old
man
would
never
have
ventured
this
confidence
but
to
hughie
to
his
own
surprise
he
found
it
easy
to
talk
a
terrible
thing
he
repeated
and
it
will
always
be
finding
you
hughie
listened
to
him
with
a
fearful
sinking
of
heart
thinking
of
himself
and
his
sin
yes
repeated
the
old
man
with
awful
solemnity
it
will
come
up
with
you
at
but
ventured
hughie
timidly
wo
god
forgive
wo
he
ever
forget
the
old
man
looked
at
him
leaning
upon
his
hoe
yes
he
will
forgive
but
for
those
who
have
had
great
privileges
and
who
have
sinned
against
light
i
will
not
the
fear
deepened
in
hughie
heart
do
you
mean
that
god
will
not
forgive
a
man
who
has
had
a
good
chance
an
elder
or
a
minister
or
or
a
minister
son
say
like
me
there
was
something
in
hughie
tone
that
startled
the
old
man
he
glanced
at
hughie
face
what
am
i
saying
he
cried
it
is
of
myself
i
am
thinking
boy
and
of
no
minister
or
minister
but
hughie
stood
looking
at
him
his
face
showing
his
terrible
anxiety
god
and
sin
were
vivid
realities
to
him
yes
yes
said
the
old
man
to
himself
it
is
a
great
gospel
far
as
the
east
is
distant
from
the
west
plenteous
redemption
is
ever
found
with
him
but
do
you
think
said
hughie
in
a
low
voice
god
will
tell
all
our
sins
will
he
make
them
known
god
forbid
cried
the
old
man
their
sins
and
their
iniquities
will
i
remember
no
more
depths
of
the
sea
no
no
boy
he
will
surely
forget
and
he
will
not
be
proclaiming
it
was
a
strange
picture
the
old
man
leaning
upon
the
top
of
his
hoe
looking
over
at
the
lad
the
gloom
of
his
face
irradiated
with
a
momentary
gleam
of
hope
and
the
boy
looking
back
at
him
with
almost
breathless
eagerness
it
would
be
great
said
hughie
at
last
if
he
would
yes
said
the
old
man
the
gleam
in
his
face
growing
brighter
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
and
forgiving
with
him
is
forgetting
ah
yes
it
is
a
great
gospel
he
continued
and
standing
there
he
lifted
up
his
hand
and
broke
into
a
kind
of
chant
in
gaelic
of
which
hughie
could
catch
no
meaning
but
the
exalted
look
on
the
old
man
face
was
translation
enough
must
we
always
tell
said
hughie
after
the
old
man
had
ceased
what
are
you
saying
laddie
i
say
must
we
always
tell
our
sins
i
mean
to
people
the
old
man
thought
a
moment
it
is
not
always
good
to
be
talking
about
our
sins
to
people
that
is
for
god
to
hear
but
we
must
be
ready
to
make
right
what
is
yes
yes
said
hughie
eagerly
of
course
one
would
be
glad
to
do
the
old
man
gave
him
one
keen
glance
and
began
hoeing
again
ye
better
be
asking
ye
mother
about
that
she
will
no
no
said
hughie
i
the
old
man
paused
in
his
work
looked
at
the
boy
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
went
on
working
again
speak
to
my
woman
he
said
after
a
few
strokes
of
his
hoe
she
a
wonderful
wise
and
hughie
wished
that
he
dared
during
the
days
of
the
planting
they
became
great
friends
and
to
their
mutual
good
the
mother
keen
eyes
noted
the
change
both
in
hughie
and
in
her
husband
and
was
glad
for
it
it
was
she
that
suggested
to
billy
jack
that
he
needed
help
in
the
back
pasture
with
the
stones
billy
jack
quick
to
take
her
meaning
eagerly
insisted
that
help
he
must
have
indeed
he
could
not
get
on
with
the
plowing
unless
the
stones
were
taken
off
and
so
it
came
that
hughie
and
the
old
man
with
old
fly
hitched
up
in
the
spent
two
happy
and
not
unprofitable
days
in
the
back
pasture
gravely
they
discussed
the
high
themes
of
sovereignty
and
man
freedom
with
all
their
practical
issues
upon
conduct
and
destiny
only
once
and
that
very
shyly
did
the
old
man
bring
round
the
talk
to
the
subject
of
their
first
conversation
that
meant
so
much
to
them
both
the
lord
will
not
be
wanting
to
shame
us
beyond
what
is
necessary
he
said
there
are
certain
sins
which
he
will
bring
to
light
but
there
are
those
that
in
his
mercy
he
permits
us
to
hide
provided
always
he
added
with
emphasis
we
are
done
with
yes
indeed
assented
hughie
eagerly
and
who
would
be
done
with
them
but
the
old
man
shook
his
head
sadly
if
that
were
always
true
a
man
would
soon
be
rid
of
his
evil
heart
but
he
continued
as
if
eager
to
turn
the
conversation
you
will
be
talking
with
my
woman
about
it
she
a
wonderful
wise
woman
somehow
the
opportunity
came
to
hughie
to
take
the
old
man
advice
on
saturday
evening
just
before
leaving
for
home
he
found
himself
alone
with
finch
sitting
beside
the
open
window
watching
the
sun
go
down
behind
the
trees
what
a
splendid
sunset
he
cried
he
was
ever
sensitive
to
the
majestic
drama
of
nature
ay
said
finch
the
clouds
and
the
sun
make
wonderful
beauty
together
but
without
the
sun
the
clouds
are
ugly
hughie
quickly
took
her
meaning
they
are
not
pleasant
he
said
no
not
pleasant
she
replied
but
with
the
sunlight
upon
them
they
are
hughie
was
silent
for
some
moments
and
then
suddenly
burst
out
mrs
finch
does
god
forget
sins
and
will
he
keep
them
hid
from
people
i
mean
ay
she
said
with
quiet
conviction
he
will
forget
and
he
will
hide
them
why
should
he
lay
the
burden
of
our
sins
upon
others
and
if
he
does
not
why
should
we
do
you
mean
we
need
not
always
tell
i
like
to
tell
my
some
ay
she
replied
it
a
weary
wark
and
a
lanely
to
carry
it
oor
lane
but
it
an
awfu
grief
to
hear
o
anither
sin
an
awfu
grief
she
repeated
to
herself
but
burst
out
hughie
i
never
be
right
till
i
tell
my
ay
and
then
it
is
she
would
be
carrying
the
weight
o
but
it
against
her
said
hughie
his
hands
going
up
to
his
face
oh
finch
it
just
awful
mean
i
do
know
how
i
did
ye
can
tell
me
laddie
if
ye
will
said
she
kindly
and
hughie
poured
forth
the
whole
burden
that
had
lain
so
long
upon
him
but
he
told
it
laying
upon
foxy
small
blame
for
during
those
days
his
own
part
had
come
to
bulk
so
large
with
him
that
foxy
was
almost
forgotten
for
some
moments
after
he
had
done
finch
sat
in
silence
leaning
forward
and
patting
the
boy
bowed
head
ay
but
he
is
rightly
named
she
said
at
length
who
asked
hughie
surprised
yon
then
she
added
but
ye
done
wi
him
and
his
tricks
and
ye
stand
up
against
him
and
be
a
man
for
the
wee
oh
i
do
know
said
hughie
too
sick
at
heart
and
too
penetrated
with
the
miserable
sense
of
his
own
meanness
and
cowardice
to
make
any
promise
and
as
tae
ye
mither
laddie
went
on
finch
it
will
be
a
sair
burden
for
when
finch
was
greatly
moved
she
always
dropped
into
her
broadest
scotch
oh
yes
i
know
said
hughie
his
voice
now
broken
with
sobs
and
that
the
worst
of
it
if
i
did
have
to
tell
her
she
just
break
her
heart
i
know
she
thinks
i
so
oh
oh
the
long
pent
up
feelings
came
flooding
forth
in
groans
and
sobs
for
some
moments
finch
sat
quietly
and
then
she
said
listen
laddie
there
is
another
to
be
thought
of
another
asked
hughie
oh
yes
i
know
but
he
knows
already
and
indeed
i
have
often
told
him
but
besides
you
say
he
will
forget
and
take
it
away
but
mother
does
know
and
does
well
then
laddie
said
finch
with
quiet
firmness
let
her
tell
ye
what
to
do
mak
ye
offer
to
tell
her
and
warn
her
that
grieve
ye
baith
and
then
let
her
yes
i
do
it
i
do
it
and
if
she
says
so
then
tell
and
so
he
did
and
when
he
came
back
to
the
finch
on
monday
morning
for
his
mother
saw
that
leaving
school
for
a
time
would
be
no
serious
loss
and
a
week
or
two
with
the
finches
might
be
a
great
gain
he
came
radiant
to
finch
and
finding
her
in
her
chair
by
the
open
window
alone
he
burst
forth
i
told
her
and
she
would
let
me
she
want
to
know
so
long
as
i
said
it
was
all
made
right
and
she
promised
she
would
trust
me
just
the
same
oh
she
splendid
my
mother
and
she
coming
this
week
to
see
you
and
i
tell
you
i
just
feel
like
like
anything
i
ca
keep
still
i
like
fido
when
he
let
off
his
chain
he
just
goes
then
after
a
pause
he
added
in
a
graver
tone
and
mother
read
zaccheus
to
me
and
is
it
fine
how
he
never
said
a
word
to
him
hughie
was
too
excited
to
be
coherent
but
stood
up
for
him
and
here
hughie
voice
became
more
grave
i
going
to
restore
fourfold
i
going
to
work
at
the
hay
and
i
fired
that
old
pistol
into
the
pond
and
i
not
afraid
of
foxy
any
more
not
a
hughie
rushed
breathlessly
through
his
story
while
the
dark
face
before
him
glowed
with
intelligent
sympathy
but
she
only
said
when
he
had
done
it
is
a
graund
thing
to
be
free
is
it
no
chapter
x

i
in
a
hurry
cameron
and
i
ca
very
well
wait
said
hughie
trying
to
preserve
an
evenness
of
tone
and
not
allow
his
excitement
to
appear
well
well
what
the
matter
whatever
when
hughie
refused
a
bit
bannock
and
honey
something
must
be
seriously
wrong
nothing
at
all
but
i
just
wanting
don
for
a
for
well
well
just
go
to
the
old
barn
and
cry
at
hughie
found
don
in
the
old
barn
busy
rigging
up
his
plow
for
the
harvest
was
in
and
the
fall
plowing
was
soon
to
begin
man
don
cried
hughie
in
a
subdued
voice
it
the
greatest
thing
you
ever
heard
what
is
it
now
hughie
you
look
fairly
lifted
have
you
seen
a
ghost
a
ghost
no
something
better
than
that
i
can
tell
hughie
drew
near
and
lowered
his
voice
while
don
worked
on
indifferently
it
a
bear
don
dropped
his
plow
his
indifference
vanished
the
camerons
were
great
hunters
and
many
a
bear
had
they
with
their
famous
black
dogs
brought
home
in
their
day
but
not
for
the
past
year
or
two
and
never
had
don
bagged
anything
bigger
than
a
fox
or
a
coon
where
did
you
see
him
i
did
see
don
looked
disgusted
but
he
was
in
our
house
last
look
here
now
stop
that
said
don
gripping
hughie
by
the
jacket
and
shaking
him
but
hughie
summer
in
the
had
built
up
his
muscles
and
so
he
shook
himself
free
from
don
grasp
and
said
look
out
there
i
telling
you
the
truth
last
night
father
was
out
late
and
the
supper
things
were
left
on
the
table
some
honey
and
stuff
and
after
father
had
been
asleep
for
a
while
he
was
wakened
by
some
one
tramping
about
the
house
he
got
up
came
out
of
his
room
and
called
out
where
are
the
matches
and
just
then
there
was
an
awful
crash
and
something
hairy
brushed
past
his
leg
in
the
dark
and
got
out
of
the
door
we
all
came
down
and
there
was
the
table
upset
the
dishes
all
on
the
floor
and
four
great
big
deep
scratches
in
the
pshaw
it
must
have
been
fido
was
in
the
barn
and
just
mad
to
get
out
and
besides
the
tracks
are
there
yet
behind
the
house
it
was
a
bear
sure
enough
and
going
after
you
yes
and
i
want
you
to
come
with
the
oh

said
don
considering
like
enough
in
the
big
swamp
or
in
mcleod
beech
bush
they
awful
fond
of
beechnuts
but
the
dogs
can
track
him
ca
they
by
jingo
i
like
to
get
him
said
don
kindling
under
excitement
wait
a
bit
now
do
say
a
word
if
murdie
hears
want
to
come
sure
and
we
do
want
him
you
wait
here
till
i
get
the
gun
and
the
have
you
got
any
bullets
or
slugs
yes
lots
why
have
you
a
gun
yes
you
just
bet
i

our
gun

did
you
think
i
was
going
to
do
put
salt
on
his
tail
i
got
it
down
the
all
right
you
wait
there
for
do
be
long
said
hughie
slipping
away
it
was
half
an
hour
before
don
appeared
with
the
gun
and
the
dogs
what
in
the
world
kept
you
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
said
hughie
impatiently
i
tell
you
it
no
easy
thing
to
get
away
with
mother
on
hand
but
all
right
here
your
bullets
and
slugs
i
brought
some
bannocks
and
cheese
we
do
know
when
we
get
home
we
pick
up
the
track
in
your
brule
does
any
one
know
you
going
no
only
fusie
he
wanted
to
come
but
i
would
have
it
fusie
gets
so
hughie
calmness
was
not
phenomenal
he
could
hardly
stand
still
for
two
consecutive
seconds
well
let
go
and
don
set
off
on
a
trot
with
one
of
the
black
dogs
in
leash
and
the
other
following
and
after
him
came
hughie
running
lightly
in
twenty
minutes
they
were
at
the
manse
clearing
now
said
don
pulling
up
where
did
you
say
you
saw
his
track
just
back
of
the
house
there
and
round
the
barn
and
then
straight
for
the
the
boys
stood
looking
across
the
fallen
timber
toward
the
barn
there
fido
barking
said
hughie
i
bet
he
on
the
scent
yes
answered
don
and
there
your
father
gimmini
crickets
so
it
is
said
hughie
slowly
i
do
think
worth
while
going
up
there
to
get
that
track
ca
we
get
it
just
as
well
in
the
woods
here
there
were
always
things
to
do
about
the
house
and
besides
the
minister
knew
nothing
of
hughie
familiarity
with
the
gun
and
hence
would
soon
have
put
a
stop
to
any
such
rash
venture
as
the
boys
waited
listening
to
fido
who
was
running
back
and
forward
between
the
brule
and
the
house
barking
furiously
the
minister
seemed
interested
in
fido
manoeuvres
and
followed
him
a
little
way
man
said
hughie
in
a
whisper
perhaps
he
go
and
look
for
the
gun
himself
and
fido
will
find
us
sure
i
say
let
let
wait
a
minute
said
don
to
see
what
direction
fido
takes
and
then
we
put
our
dogs
in
a
few
minutes
hughie
breathed
more
freely
for
his
father
seemed
to
lose
his
interest
in
fido
and
returned
slowly
to
the
house
now
said
hughie
let
get
down
into
the
brule
as
near
fido
as
we
can
cautiously
the
boys
made
their
way
through
the
fallen
timber
keeping
as
much
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
underbrush
but
though
they
hunted
about
for
some
time
the
dogs
evidently
got
no
scent
for
they
remained
quite
uninterested
in
the
proceedings
we
have
to
get
up
closer
to
where
fido
is
said
don
and
the
sooner
we
get
there
the
i
suppose
so
said
hughie
i
suppose
i
had
better
go
fido
will
stop
barking
for
so
while
don
lay
hid
with
the
dogs
in
the
brule
hughie
stole
nearer
and
nearer
to
fido
who
was
still
chasing
down
toward
the
brule
and
back
to
the
house
as
if
urging
some
one
to
come
forth
and
investigate
the
strange
scent
he
had
discovered
gradually
hughie
worked
his
way
closer
to
fido
until
within
calling
distance
just
as
he
was
about
to
whistle
for
the
dog
the
back
door
opened
and
forth
came
the
minister
again
by
this
time
fido
had
passed
into
the
brule
a
little
way
and
could
not
be
seen
from
the
house
it
was
an
anxious
moment
for
hughie
he
made
a
sudden
desperate
resolve
he
must
secure
fido
now
or
else
give
up
the
chance
of
getting
on
the
trail
of
the
bear
so
he
left
his
place
of
hiding
and
bending
low
ran
swiftly
forward
until
fido
caught
sight
of
him
and
hearing
his
voice
came
to
him
barking
loudly
and
making
every
demonstration
of
excitement
and
joy
he
seized
the
dog
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
down
and
after
holding
him
quiet
for
a
moment
hauled
him
back
to
don
we
have
to
take
him
with
us
he
said
i
put
this
string
on
his
collar
and
he
go
all
and
to
this
don
agreed
though
very
unwillingly
for
he
had
no
confidence
in
fido
hunting
ability
i
tell
you
he
a
great
fighter
said
hughie
if
we
should
ever
get
near
that
oh
pshaw
said
don
he
may
fight
dogs
well
enough
but
when
it
comes
to
a
bear
it
a
different
thing
every
dog
is
scared
of
a
bear
the
first
time
he
sees
well
i
bet
you
fido
wo
run
from
anything
said
hughie
confidently
to
their
great
relief
they
saw
the
minister
set
off
in
the
opposite
direction
across
the
fields
thank
goodness
he
off
to
the
mcrae
said
hughie
now
then
said
don
we
go
back
to
the
track
there
and
put
the
dogs
on
you
go
on
with
and
hughie
set
off
with
fido
pulling
eagerly
upon
the
string
when
they
reached
the
spot
where
fido
had
been
seized
by
hughie
suddenly
the
black
dog
who
had
been
following
don
at
some
distance
stopped
short
and
began
to
growl
in
a
moment
his
mate
threw
up
his
nose
and
began
sniffing
about
the
hair
rising
stiff
upon
his
back
he
catching
it
said
don
in
an
excited
tone
here
you
hold
him
i
must
get
the
other
one
or
he
be
he
was
not
a
minute
too
soon
for
the
other
dog
who
had
been
ranging
about
suddenly
found
the
trail
and
with
a
fierce
short
bark
was
about
to
dash
off
when
don
threw
himself
upon
him
in
a
few
moments
both
dogs
were
on
the
leash
and
set
off
upon
the
scent
at
a
great
pace
the
trail
was
evidently
plain
enough
to
the
dogs
for
they
followed
hard
leading
the
boys
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
bush
he
making
for
the
big
swamp
said
don
and
on
they
went
with
eyes
and
ears
on
the
alert
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
the
snort
of
a
bear
or
to
meet
him
on
the
further
side
of
every
bunch
of
underbrush
for
an
hour
they
went
on
at
a
steady
trot
over
and
under
fallen
logs
splashing
through
water
holes
crashing
over
dead
brushwood
and
tearing
through
the
interlacing
boughs
of
the
thick
underbrush
of
spruce
and
balsam
the
black
dogs
never
hesitated
they
knew
well
what
was
their
business
there
and
that
they
kept
strictly
in
mind
fido
on
the
other
hand
who
loved
to
roam
the
woods
in
an
aimless
hunt
for
any
and
every
wild
thing
that
might
cross
his
nose
but
who
never
had
seriously
hunted
anything
in
particular
trotted
behind
hughie
with
rather
a
bored
expression
on
his
face
the
trail
which
had
led
them
steadily
north
all
at
once
turned
west
and
away
from
the
swamp
say
said
don
he
making
for
alan
gorrach
man
said
hughie
that
would
be
fine
to
get
him
there
it
good
and
open
too
open
by
a
long
way
grunted
don
we
never
get
him
sure
enough
the
dogs
led
up
from
the
swamp
and
along
the
path
to
cabin
the
door
stood
open
and
in
answer
to
don
horo
alan
came
out
what
now
he
said
glowering
at
don

at
him
suspiciously
but
said
not
a
word

very
good
dogs

your
ways

said
alan
these
black

good
condition
but

good
fat
alan
wrath

to
rise
will

going
on
now

business

alan
there
a
hard
winter
coming
mac
an
diabhoil
cried
alan
in
a
shrill
voice
suddenly
bursting
into
fury
i
will
be
having
your
heart
blood
he
cried
rushing
into
his
cabin
come
on
hughie
cried
don
and
away
they
rushed
following
the
black
dogs
upon
the
trail
of
the
bear
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
swamp
the
dogs
led
the
way
the
going
becoming
more
difficult
and
the
underbrush
thicker
at
every
step
after
an
hour
or
two
of
hard
work
the
dogs
began
to
falter
and
ran
hither
and
thither
now
on
one
scent
and
then
on
another
till
tired
out
and
disgusted
don
held
them
in
and
threw
himself
down
upon
the
soft
moss
that
lay
deep
over
everything
we
on
his
old
tracks
here
said
don
savagely
and
you
ca
pick
out
the
new
from
the
his
hole
must
be
somewhere
not
too
far
away
said
hughie
yes
perhaps
it
is
but
then
again
it
may
be
across
the
ridge
at
any
rate
we
have
some
as
they
ate
the
bannocks
and
cheese
they
pictured
to
themselves
what
they
should
do
if
they
ever
should
come
up
with
the
bear
one
thing
we
got
to
be
careful
of
said
don
and
that
is
not
to
lose
our
that
so
assented
hughie
feeling
quite
cool
and
at
the
time
because
if
you
lose
your
head
you
done
for
continued
don
remember
ken
mcgregor
no
said
hughie
did
you
ever
hear
that
why
he
ran
into
a
bear
and
made
a
drive
at
him
with
his
axe
but
the
bear
with
one
paw
knocked
the
axe
clear
out
of
his
hand
and
with
one
sweep
of
the
other
tore
his
insides
right
out
they
mighty
cute
too
went
on
don
they
pretend
to
be
almost
dead
just
to
coax
you
near
enough
and
then
they
spin
round
on
their
hind
legs
like
a
rooster
if
they
ever
do
catch
you
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
lie
still
and
make
believe
you
dead
and
then
unless
they
very
hungry
they
wo
hurt
you
after
half
an
hour
rest
the
hunting
instinct
awoke
again
within
them
and
the
boys
determined
to
make
another
attempt
after
circling
about
the
swamp
for
some
time
the
boys
came
upon
a
beaten
track
which
led
straight
through
the
heart
of
the
swamp
i
say
said
don
this
is
going
to
strike
the
ridge
somewhere
just
about
there
pointing
northeast
and
if
we
do
see
anything
between
here
and
the
ridge
we
strike
home
that
way
it
be
better
walking
than
this
cursed
swamp
anyway
are
you
tired
hughie
refused
to
acknowledge
any
weariness
well
then
i
am
said
don
the
trail
was
clear
enough
and
they
were
able
to
follow
at
a
good
pace
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
as
they
had
expected
they
struck
the
northeast
end
of
the
swamp
here
again
they
called
a
halt
and
tying
up
the
dogs
lay
down
upon
the
dry
brown
leaves
lazily
eating
the
beechnuts
and
discussing
their
prospects
of
meeting
the
bear
and
their
plans
for
dealing
with
him
well
let
go
on
at
length
said
don
there
just
a
chance
of
our
meeting
him
on
this
ridge
he
got
a
den
somewhere
down
in
the
swamp
and
he
may
be
coming
home
this
way
besides
it
take
us
all
our
time
now
to
get
home
before
dark
i
guess
there
no
use
keeping
the
dogs
any
longer
we
just
let
them
so
saying
don
let
the
black
dogs
go
free
but
after
a
little
skirmishing
through
the
open
beech
woods
the
dogs
appeared
to
lose
all
interest
in
the
expedition
and
kept
close
to
don
heels
fido
on
the
other
hand
followed
ranging
the
woods
on
either
side
cheerfully
interested
in
scaring
up
rabbits
and
squirrels
he
had
never
known
the
rapture
of
bringing
down
big
game
and
so
was
content
with
whatever
came
his
way
at
length
the
hunters
reached
the
main
trail
where
their
paths
separated
but
a
little
of
the
swamp
still
remained
and
on
the
other
side
was
the
open
clearing
this
is
your
best
way
said
don
pointing
out
the
path
to
hughie
we
had
bad
luck
but
we
try
again
we
may
meet
him
still
you
know
so
do
fire
at
any
squirrel
or
anything
if
i
hear
a
shot
come
to
you
and
you
do
the
same
by
i
say
said
hughie
where
does
this
track
of
mine
come
out
is
it
below
the
deepole
there
or
is
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
why
do
you
know
said
don
this
runs
right
up
to
the
back
of
the
fisher
berry
patch
and
through
the
to
your
own
clearing
i
go
with
you
if
you
oh
pshaw
said
hughie
i
find
it
all
right
come
on
but
fido
had
disappeared
good
night
good
night
said
don
mind
you
do
fire
unless
it
at
a
bear
do
the
in
a
few
minutes
hughie
found
himself
alone
in
the
thick
underbrush
of
the
swamp
the
shadows
were
lying
heavy
and
the
sunlight
that
still
caught
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
was
quite
lost
in
the
gloom
of
the
low
underbrush
deep
moss
under
foot
with
fallen
trees
and
balsam
and
cedars
made
the
walking
difficult
and
every
step
hughie
wished
himself
out
in
the
clearing
he
began
to
feel
too
the
oppression
of
the
falling
darkness
he
tried
whistling
to
keep
up
his
courage
but
the
sound
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
woods
about
him
and
he
soon
gave
it
up
after
a
few
minutes
he
stood
still
and
called
for
fido
but
the
dog
had
gone
on
some
hunt
of
his
own
and
with
a
sense
of
deeper
loneliness
he
set
himself
again
to
his
struggle
with
the
moss
and
brush
and
fallen
trees
at
length
he
reached
firmer
ground
and
began
with
more
cheerful
heart
to
climb
up
to
the
open
suddenly
he
heard
a
rustle
and
saw
the
brush
in
front
of
him
move
oh
there
you
are
you
brute
he
cried
come
in
here
come
in
fido
here
sir
he
pushed
the
bushes
aside
and
his
heart
jumped
and
filled
his
mouth
a
huge
black
shape
stood
right
across
his
path
not
ten
paces
away
a
moment
they
gazed
at
each
other
and
then
with
a
low
growl
the
bear
began
to
sway
awkwardly
toward
him
hughie
threw
up
his
gun
and
fired
the
bear
paused
snapping
viciously
and
tearing
at
his
wounded
shoulder
and
then
rushed
on
hughie
without
waiting
to
rise
on
his
hind
legs
like
a
flash
hughie
dodged
behind
the
brush
and
then
fled
like
the
wind
toward
the
open
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
the
bear
shambling
after
him
at
a
great
pace
and
gaining
at
every
jump
and
his
heart
froze
with
terror
the
balsams
and
spruces
were
all
too
low
for
safety
a
little
way
before
him
he
saw
a
small
birch
if
he
could
only
make
that
he
might
escape
summoning
all
his
strength
he
rushed
for
the
tree
the
bear
closing
fast
upon
him
could
he
spring
up
out
of
reach
of
the
bear
awful
claws
two
yards
from
the
tree
he
heard
an
angry
snap
and
snarl
at
his
heels
with
a
cry
he
dropped
his
gun
and
springing
for
the
lowest
bough
drew
up
his
legs
quickly
after
him
with
the
horrible
feeling
of
having
them
ripped
asunder
to
his
amazement
he
found
that
the
bear
was
not
scrambling
up
the
tree
after
him
but
was
still
some
paces
off
with
fido
skirmishing
at
long
range
it
was
fido
timely
nip
that
had
brought
him
to
a
sudden
halt
and
allowed
hughie
to
make
his
climb
in
safety
good
dog
fido
sic
him
sic
him
old
fellow
cried
out
hughie
but
fido
was
new
to
this
kind
of
warfare
and
at
every
jump
of
the
raging
brute
he
fled
into
the
brush
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
returning
however
to
the
attack
as
the
bear
retired
after
driving
fido
off
the
bear
rushed
at
the
tree
and
in
a
fury
began
tearing
up
its
roots
then
as
if
realizing
the
futility
of
this
he
flung
himself
upon
its
trunk
and
began
shaking
it
with
great
violence
from
side
to
side
hughie
soon
saw
that
the
tree
would
not
long
stand
such
an
attack
he
slipped
down
to
the
lowest
bough
so
that
his
weight
might
be
taken
from
the
swaying
top
and
encouraging
fido
awaited
results
he
found
himself
singularly
cool
having
escaped
immediate
danger
the
hunter
instinct
awoke
within
him
and
he
longed
to
get
that
bear
if
he
only
had
his
gun
he
would
soon
settle
him
but
the
bear
unfortunately
had
possession
of
that
he
began
hurriedly
to
cut
off
as
stout
a
branch
as
he
could
to
make
himself
a
club
he
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
the
bear
realizing
that
he
could
neither
tear
up
the
tree
by
the
roots
nor
shake
his
enemy
out
of
it
decided
apparently
to
go
up
for
him
he
first
set
himself
to
get
rid
of
fido
which
he
partially
succeeded
in
doing
by
chasing
him
a
long
distance
off
then
with
a
great
rush
he
flew
at
the
tree
and
with
amazing
rapidity
began
to
climb
hughie
surprised
by
this
swift
attack
hastened
to
climb
to
the
higher
branches
but
in
a
moment
he
saw
that
this
would
be
fatal
remembering
that
the
bear
is
like
the
dog
in
his
sensitive
parts
he
descended
to
meet
his
advancing
foe
and
reaching
down
hit
him
a
sharp
blow
on
the
snout
with
a
roar
of
rage
and
surprise
the
bear
let
go
his
hold
slipped
to
the
ground
and
began
to
tear
up
the
earth
sneezing
violently
oh
if
i
only
had
that
gun
groaned
hughie
i
get
him
and
if
he
gets
away
after
fido
again
i
believe
i
try
the
bear
now
set
himself
to
plan
some
new
form
of
attack
he
had
been
wounded
but
only
enough
to
enrage
him
and
his
fury
served
to
fix
more
firmly
in
his
head
the
single
purpose
of
getting
into
his
grip
this
enemy
of
his
in
the
tree
whom
he
appeared
to
have
so
nearly
at
his
mercy
whatever
his
new
plan
might
be
a
necessary
preliminary
was
getting
rid
of
fido
and
this
he
proceeded
to
do
round
about
the
trees
he
pursued
him
getting
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
birch
till
hughie
watching
his
chance
slipped
down
the
tree
and
ran
for
his
gun
but
no
sooner
had
he
stooped
for
it
than
the
bear
saw
the
move
and
with
an
angry
roar
rushed
for
him
once
more
hughie
sprang
for
his
branch
but
the
gun
caught
in
the
boughs
and
he
slipped
to
the
ground
the
bear
within
striking
distance
with
a
cry
he
sprang
again
reached
his
bough
and
drew
himself
up
holding
his
precious
gun
safe
wondering
how
he
had
escaped
again
it
was
fido
that
had
saved
him
for
as
the
bear
had
gathered
himself
to
spring
fido
seeing
his
chance
rushed
boldly
in
and
flinging
himself
upon
the
hind
leg
of
the
enraged
brute
held
fast
it
was
the
boy
salvation
but
alas
it
was
fido
destruction
for
wheeling
suddenly
the
bear
struck
a
swift
downward
blow
with
his
powerful
front
paw
and
tore
the
whole
side
of
the
faithful
brute
wide
open
with
a
howl
poor
fido
dragged
himself
away
out
of
reach
and
lay
down
moaning
pitifully
the
bear
realizing
that
he
had
got
rid
of
one
foe
now
proceeded
more
cautiously
to
deal
with
the
other
and
began
warily
climbing
the
tree
keeping
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
upon
hughie
meantime
hughie
was
loading
his
gun
with
all
speed
he
emptied
his
into
the
muzzle
and
with
the
bear
coming
slowly
nearer
began
to
search
for
his
bullets
through
one
pocket
after
another
his
trembling
fingers
flew
while
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
he
menaced
his
approaching
enemy
where
are
those
bullets
he
groaned
ah
here
they
are
diving
into
his
trousers
pocket
fool
of
a
place
to
keep
them
too
he
took
a
handful
of
slugs
and
bullets
poured
them
into
his
gun
rammed
down
a
wadding
of
leaves
upon
all
retreating
as
he
did
so
to
the
higher
limbs
the
bear
following
him
steadily
but
just
as
he
had
his
cap
securely
fixed
upon
the
nipple
the
bear
suddenly
revealed
his
plan
holding
by
his
front
paws
he
threw
his
hind
legs
off
from
the
trunk
it
was
his
usual
method
of
felling
trees
the
tree
swayed
and
bent
till
the
top
almost
touched
the
ground
but
hughie
with
his
legs
wreathed
round
the
trunk
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
with
its
muzzle
almost
touching
the
breast
of
the
hanging
brute
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
a
terrific
report
the
bear
dropped
in
a
heap
from
the
tree
and
hughie
was
hurled
violently
to
the
ground
some
distance
away
partially
stunned
he
raised
himself
to
see
the
bear
struggle
up
to
a
sitting
position
and
gnashing
his
teeth
and
flinging
blood
and
foam
from
his
mouth
begin
to
drag
himself
toward
him
he
was
conscious
of
a
languid
indifference
and
found
himself
wondering
how
long
the
bear
would
take
to
cover
the
distance
but
while
he
was
thus
cogitating
there
was
a
sharp
quick
bark
and
a
great
black
form
hurled
itself
at
the
bear
throat
and
bore
the
fierce
brute
to
the
ground
drawing
a
long
sigh
hughie
sank
back
to
the
ground
with
the
sound
of
a
shot
in
his
ears
and
darkness
veiling
his
eyes
he
was
awakened
by
don
voice
anxiously
calling
him
are
you
hurt
much
hughie
did
he
squeeze
you
hughie
sat
up
blinking
stupidly
what
he
asked
who
why
the
bear
of
the
bear
no
man
it
too
bad
you
were
here
don
he
went
on
rousing
himself
he
ca
be
gone
not
very
said
don
laughing
loud
yonder
he
hughie
turned
his
head
and
gazed
wondering
at
the
great
black
mass
over
which
don
black
dogs
were
standing
guard
and
sniffing
with
supreme
satisfaction
then
all
came
back
to
him
where
fido
he
asked
rising
yes
it
was
fido
saved
me
for
sure
he
tackled
the
bear
every
time
he
rushed
at
me
and
hung
onto
him
just
as
i
climbed
the
tree
the
second
as
he
spoke
he
walked
over
to
the
place
where
he
had
last
seen
the
dog
a
little
farther
on
behind
a
they
found
poor
fido
horribly
mangled
and
dead
hughie
stooped
down
over
him
poor
old
boy
poor
old
fido
he
said
in
a
low
voice
stroking
his
head
don
turned
away
and
walked
whistling
toward
the
bear
as
he
sat
beside
the
black
carcass
his
two
dogs
came
to
him
he
threw
his
arms
round
them
saying
poor
old
blackie
poor
nigger
and
he
understood
how
hughie
was
feeling
behind
the
beside
the
faithful
dog
that
had
given
him
his
life
as
he
sat
there
waiting
for
hughie
he
heard
voices
horo
he
shouted
where
are
you
is
that
you
don
it
was
his
father
voice
yes
here
we
is
hughie
there
inquired
another
voice
losh
me
that
the
minister
said
don
yes
all
right
he
cried
aloud
as
up
came
long
john
cameron
and
the
minister
with
fusie
and
a
stranger
bringing
up
the
rear
fine
work
this
you
fine
fellows
indeed
cried
long
john
frightening
people
in
this
where
is
hughie
said
the
minister
sternly
hughie
came
from
behind
the
brush
hurriedly
wiping
his
eyes
here
father
he
said
and
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
of
the
night
pray
said
the
minister
angrily
turning
toward
him
i
could
get
home
very
well
replied
hughie
and
why
not
pray
do
begin
any
excuses
with
me
nothing
annoyed
the
minister
as
an
attempt
to
excuse
i
guess
he
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
have
got
home
half
an
hour
ago
sir
broke
in
don
laughing
look
he
pointed
to
the
bear
lying
dead
with
nigger
standing
over
him
the
lord
save
us
said
long
john
cameron
himself
the
greatest
among
the
hunters
of
the
county
what
do
you
say
and
how
did
you
get
him
he
a
grand
the
old
man
the
minister
and
don
walked
about
the
bear
in
admiring
procession
yon
a
terrible
gash
said
long
john
pointing
to
a
gaping
wound
in
the
breast
was
that
your
snider
don
not
a
bit
of
it
father
the
bear
hughie
he
killed
him
losh
me
and
you
do
tell
me
and
how
did
you
manage
that
hughie
he
chased
me
up
that
tree
and
i
guess
would
have
got
me
only
for
the
minister
gasped
got
you
was
he
as
near
as
that
he
was
three
feet
away
said
hughie
and
with
that
he
proceeded
to
give
in
his
most
graphic
style
a
description
of
his
great
fight
with
the
bear
when
i
heard
the
first
shot
said
don
i
was
away
across
the
swamp
i
tell
you
i
tore
back
here
and
when
i
came
what
did
i
see
but
hughie
and
bear
both
sitting
down
and
looking
coolly
at
each
other
a
few
yards
apart
and
then
nigger
downed
him
and
i
put
a
bullet
into
his
don
was
greatly
delighted
and
extremely
proud
of
achievement
and
how
did
you
know
about
it
asked
don
of
his
father
it
was
the
minister
here
came
after
yes
said
the
minister
it
was
fusie
told
me
you
had
gone
off
on
a
bear
hunt
and
so
i
went
along
to
the
cameron
with
craven
here
to
see
if
you
had
got
meantime
craven
had
been
looking
hughie
over
mighty
plucky
thing
he
said
great
nerve
and
he
lapsed
into
silence
while
fusie
could
not
contain
himself
but
danced
from
one
foot
to
the
other
with
excited
exclamations
the
minister
had
come
out
intending
as
he
said
to
teach
that
boy
a
lesson
that
he
would
remember
but
as
he
listened
to
hughie
story
his
anger
gave
place
to
a
great
thankfulness
it
was
a
great
mercy
my
boy
he
said
at
length
when
he
was
quite
sure
of
his
voice
that
you
had
fido
with
yes
indeed
father
said
hughie
it
was
fido
saved
it
was
the
lord
goodness
said
the
minister
solemnly
and
a
great
mercy
said
long
john
that
your
lad
kept
his
head
and
showed
such
courage
you
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
minister
said
nothing
just
then
but
at
home
when
recounting
the
exploit
to
the
mother
he
could
hardly
contain
his
pride
in
his
son
never
thought
the
boy
would
have
a
nerve
like
that
he
so
excitable
i
had
rather
he
killed
that
bear
than
win
a
medal
at
the
the
mother
sat
silent
through
all
the
story
her
cheek
growing
more
and
more
pale
but
not
a
word
did
she
say
until
the
tale
was
done
and
then
she
said
delivereth
thee
from
destruction
a
little
like
david
mother
was
it
said
hughie
but
though
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
his
manner
and
tone
were
earnest
enough
yes
said
his
mother
a
good
deal
like
david
for
it
was
the
same
god
that
delivered
you
rather
hard
to
cut
fido
out
of
his
share
of
the
glory
said
craven
not
to
speak
of
a
cool
head
and
a
steady
murray
regarded
him
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
as
if
meditating
an
answer
but
finally
she
only
said
we
shall
cut
no
one
out
of
the
glory
due
to
at
the
the
whole
affair
was
discussed
in
all
its
bearings
in
this
discussion
hughie
took
little
part
making
light
of
his
exploit
and
giving
most
of
the
credit
to
fido
and
the
mother
wondered
at
the
unusual
reserve
and
gravity
that
had
fallen
upon
her
boy
indeed
hughie
was
wondering
at
himself
he
had
a
strange
new
feeling
in
his
heart
he
had
done
a
man
deed
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
it
unnecessary
to
glory
in
his
deeds
he
had
come
to
a
new
experience
that
great
deeds
need
no
voice
to
proclaim
them
during
the
thrilling
moments
of
that
terrible
hour
he
had
entered
the
borderland
of
manhood
and
the
awe
of
that
new
world
was
now
upon
his
spirit
it
was
chiefly
this
new
experience
of
his
that
was
sobering
him
but
it
helped
him
not
a
little
to
check
his
wonted
boyish
exuberance
that
at
the
table
opposite
him
sat
a
strange
young
man
across
whose
dark
magnetic
face
there
flitted
now
and
then
a
lazy
cynical
smile
hughie
feared
that
lazy
smile
and
he
felt
that
it
would
shrivel
into
any
feeling
of
boastfulness
the
mother
and
hughie
said
little
to
each
other
waiting
to
be
alone
and
after
hughie
had
gone
to
his
room
his
mother
talked
long
with
him
but
when
craven
on
his
way
to
bed
heard
the
low
quiet
tones
of
the
mother
voice
through
the
shut
door
he
knew
it
was
not
to
hughie
she
was
speaking
and
the
smile
upon
his
face
lost
a
little
of
its
cynicism
next
day
there
was
no
smile
when
he
stood
with
hughie
under
the
watching
the
lad
hew
flat
one
side
but
gravely
enough
he
took
the
paper
on
which
hughie
had
written
fido
saying
as
he
did
so
i
shall
cut
this
for
you
it
is
good
to
remember
brave
chapter
xi
john
craven
method
john
craven
could
not
be
said
to
take
his
seriously
and
indeed
any
one
looking
at
his
face
would
hardly
expect
him
to
take
anything
seriously
and
certainly
those
who
in
his
college
days
followed
and
courted
and
kept
pace
with
jack
craven
and
knew
his
smile
would
have
expected
from
him
anything
other
than
seriousness
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
enacting
a
kind
of
grim
comedy
exile
as
he
was
in
a
foreign
land
among
people
of
a
strange
tongue
he
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
pedagogical
method
and
consequently
he
ignored
all
rules
and
precedents
in
the
teaching
and
conduct
of
the
school
his
discipline
was
of
a
most
fantastic
kind
he
had
a
feeling
that
all
lessons
were
a
bore
therefore
he
would
assign
the
shortest
and
easiest
of
tasks
but
having
assigned
the
tasks
he
expected
perfection
in
recitation
and
impressed
his
pupils
with
the
idea
that
nothing
less
would
pass
his
ideas
of
order
were
of
the
loosest
kind
and
hence
the
noise
at
times
was
such
that
even
the
older
pupils
found
it
unbearable
but
when
the
hour
for
recitation
came
somehow
a
deathlike
stillness
fell
upon
the
school
and
the
unready
shivered
with
dread
apprehension
and
yet
he
never
thrashed
the
boys
but
his
fear
lay
upon
them
for
his
eyes
held
the
delinquent
with
such
an
intensity
of
magnetic
penetrating
power
that
the
unhappy
wretch
felt
as
if
any
kind
of
calamity
might
befall
him
when
one
looked
at
john
craven
face
it
was
the
eyes
that
caught
and
held
the
attention
they
were
black
without
either
gleam
or
glitter
indeed
almost
dull
a
lady
once
called
them
smoky
they
looked
under
lazy
lids
like
things
asleep
except
in
moments
of
passion
when
there
appeared
far
down
a
glowing
fire
red
and
terrible
at
such
moments
it
seemed
as
if
looking
through
these
one
were
catching
sight
of
a
soul
ablaze
they
were
like
the
dull
glow
of
a
furnace
through
an
inky
night
he
was
constitutionally
and
habitually
lazy
but
in
a
reading
lesson
he
would
rouse
himself
at
times
and
by
his
utterance
of
a
single
line
make
the
whole
school
sit
erect
friday
afternoon
he
gave
up
to
what
he
called
the
cultivation
of
the
finer
on
that
afternoon
he
would
bring
his
violin
and
teach
the
children
singing
hear
them
read
and
recite
and
read
for
them
himself
and
no
greater
punishment
could
be
imposed
upon
the
school
than
the
loss
of
this
afternoon
man
alive
thomas
he
mighty
queer
hughie
explained
to
his
friend
when
he
sits
there
with
his
feet
on
the
stove
smoking
away
and
reading
something
or
other
and
letting
them
all
gabble
like
a
lot
of
ducks
it
just
makes
me
mad
but
when
he
wakes
up
he
puts
the
fear
of
death
on
you
and
when
he
reads
he
makes
you
shiver
through
and
through
you
know
that
long
rigmarole
romans
countrymen
i
used
to
hate
it
well
sir
he
told
us
about
it
last
friday
you
know
on
friday
afternoons
we
do
do
any
work
but
just
have
songs
and
reading
and
that
sort
of
thing
well
sir
last
friday
he
told
us
about
the
big
row
in
rome
and
how
caesar
was
murdered
and
then
he
read
that
thing
to
us
by
gimmini
whack
it
made
me
hot
and
cold
i
could
hardly
keep
from
yelling
and
every
one
was
white
and
then
he
read
that
other
thing
you
know
about
little
nell
used
to
make
me
sick
but
my
goodness
alive
do
you
know
before
he
got
through
the
girls
were
wiping
their
eyes
and
i
was
almost
as
bad
and
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
he
mighty
queer
though
lazy
as
the
mischief
and
always
smiling
and
smiling
and
yet
you
do
feel
like
smiling
do
you
like
him
asked
thomas
bluntly
dunno
i
like
to
but
he
wo
let
you
somehow
just
smiles
at
you
and
you
feel
kind
of
the
reports
about
the
master
were
conflicting
and
disquieting
and
although
hughie
was
himself
doubtful
he
stood
up
vehemently
for
him
at
home
but
hughie
protested
the
minister
discussing
these
reports
i
am
told
that
he
actually
smokes
in
hughie
was
silent
answer
me
does
he
smoke
in
school
hours
well
confessed
hughie
reluctantly
he
does
sometimes
but
only
after
he
gives
us
all
our
work
to
smoke
in
school
hours
ejaculated
murray
horrified
well
what
the
harm
in
that
father
but
he
does
smoke
when
he
is
preaching
said
the
mother
no
but
he
smokes
right
but
not
in
well
perhaps
not
in
church
but
school
different
and
anyway
he
makes
them
read
better
and
write
better
too
said
hughie
stoutly
certainly
said
his
father
he
is
a
most
remarkable
man
a
most
unusual
what
about
your
sums
hughie
asked
his
mother
do
know
he
does
bother
much
with
that
sort
of
thing
and
just
as
you
ought
really
to
speak
to
him
about
it
said
murray
after
hughie
had
left
the
room
well
my
dear
said
the
minister
smiling
you
heard
what
hughie
said
it
would
be
rather
awkward
for
me
to
speak
to
him
about
smoking
i
think
perhaps
you
had
better
do
i
am
afraid
said
his
wife
with
a
slight
laugh
it
would
be
just
as
awkward
for
me
i
wonder
what
those
friday
afternoons
of
his
mean
she
continued
i
am
sure
i
do
know
but
everywhere
throughout
the
section
i
hear
the
children
speak
of
them
we
just
drop
in
and
see
i
ought
to
visit
the
school
you
know
very
and
so
they
did
the
master
was
surprised
and
for
a
moment
appeared
uncertain
what
to
do
he
offered
to
put
the
classes
through
their
regular
lessons
but
at
once
there
was
a
noisy
outcry
against
this
on
the
part
of
the
school
which
however
was
effectually
and
immediately
quelled
by
the
quiet
suggestion
on
the
master
part
that
anything
but
perfect
order
would
be
fatal
to
the
programme
and
upon
the
minister
requesting
that
the
usual
exercises
proceed
the
master
smilingly
agreed
we
make
friday
afternoons
he
said
at
once
a
kind
of
reward
day
for
good
work
during
the
week
and
an
opportunity
for
the
cultivation
of
some
of
the
finer
and
certainly
he
was
a
master
in
this
business
he
had
strong
dramatic
instincts
and
a
remarkable
power
to
stimulate
and
draw
forth
the
emotions
when
the
programme
of
singing
recitations
and
was
finished
there
were
insistent
calls
on
every
side
for
mark
it
appeared
to
be
the
de
resistance
in
the
minds
of
the
children
what
does
this
mean
inquired
the
minister
as
the
master
stood
smiling
at
his
pupils
oh
they
are
demanding
a
little
high
tragedy
he
said
which
i
sometimes
give
them
it
assists
in
their
reading
lessons
he
explained
apologetically
and
with
that
he
gave
them
what
hughie
called
that
rigmarole
beginning
romans
countrymen
mark
immortal
oration
well
said
the
minister
as
they
drove
away
from
the
school
what
do
you
think
of
that
now
marvelous
exclaimed
his
wife
what
dramatic
power
what
insight
what
interpretation
you
may
say
so
exclaimed
her
husband
what
an
actor
he
would
make
yes
said
his
wife
or
what
a
minister
he
would
make
i
understand
now
his
wonderful
influence
over
hughie
and
i
am
o
he
ca
do
hughie
any
harm
with
things
like
that
replied
her
husband
emphatically
no
but
hughie
now
and
then
repeats
some
of
his
sayings
about
about
religion
and
religious
convictions
that
i
do
like
and
then
he
is
hanging
about
that
twentieth
store
altogether
too
much
and
i
fancied
i
noticed
something
strange
about
him
last
friday
evening
when
he
came
home
so
o
nonsense
said
the
minister
his
reputation
has
prejudiced
you
and
that
is
not
fair
and
your
imagination
does
the
well
it
is
a
great
pity
that
he
should
not
do
something
with
himself
replied
his
wife
there
are
great
possibilities
in
that
young
he
does
not
take
himself
seriously
enough
said
her
husband
that
is
the
chief
trouble
with
and
this
was
apparently
jack
craven
opinion
of
himself
as
is
evident
from
his
letter
to
his
college
friend
ned
maitland
dear
ned
for
the
last
two
months
i
have
been
seeking
to
adjust
myself
to
my
surroundings
and
find
it
no
easy
business
i
have
struck
the
land
of
the
anakim
for
the
inhabitants
are
all
of
size
and
indeed
in
all
their
ways
more
particularly
in
their
religion
religion
is
all
over
the
place
you
are
liable
to
come
upon
a
boy
anywhere
perched
on
a
fence
corner
with
a
new
testament
in
his
hand
and
on
sunday
the
of
their
religion
is
overwhelming
every
other
interest
in
life
as
meat
drink
and
dress
are
purely
incidental
to
the
main
business
of
the
day
which
is
the
delivering
hearing
and
discussing
of
sermons
the
padre
at
whose
house
i
am
very
happily
quartered
is
a
preacher
he
has
visions
and
gives
them
to
me
he
gives
me
chills
and
thrills
as
well
and
has
discovered
to
me
a
conscience
a
portion
of
my
anatomy
that
i
had
no
suspicion
of
possessing
the
congregation
is
like
the
preacher
they
will
sit
for
two
hours
and
after
a
break
of
a
few
minutes
they
will
sit
again
for
two
hours
listening
to
sermons
and
even
the
interval
is
somewhat
evenly
divided
between
their
bread
and
cheese
in
the
churchyard
and
the
discussion
of
the
sermon
they
have
just
listened
to
they
are
great
on
theology
one
worthy
old
party
tackled
me
on
my
views
of
the
sermon
we
had
just
heard
after
a
little
preliminary
sparring
i
went
to
my
corner
i
often
wonder
in
what
continent
i
am
the
school
a
primitive
little
log
affair
has
much
run
to
seed
but
offers
opportunity
for
repose
i
shall
avoid
any
unnecessary
excitement
in
this
connection
in
private
life
the
padre
is
really
very
decent
we
have
great
smokes
together
and
talks
on
all
subjects
he
has
very
decided
opinions
and
in
everything
but
religion
liberal
views
i
lure
him
into
philosophic
discussions
and
overwhelm
him
with
my
newest
and
biggest
metaphysical
terms
which
always
reduce
his
enormous
cocksureness
to
more
reasonable
dimensions
the
minister
wife
is
quite
another
proposition
she
argues
too
but
unfortunately
she
asks
questions
in
the
meekest
way
possible
acknowledging
her
ignorance
of
my
big
terms
and
insisting
upon
definitions
and
exact
meanings
and
then
it
all
over
with
me
how
she
ever
came
to
this
far
land
heaven
knows
and
none
but
heaven
can
explain
such
waste
having
no
kindred
soul
to
talk
with
i
fancy
she
enjoys
conversation
with
myself
sic
revels
in
music
is
transported
to
the
fifth
heaven
by
my
performance
on
the
violin
but
evidently
pities
me
and
regards
me
as
dangerous
but
my
dear
maitland
after
a
somewhat
wide
and
varied
experience
of
fine
ladies
i
give
you
my
verdict
that
here
among
the
anakim
and
in
this
wild
woody
land
is
a
lady
fine
and
fair
and
saintly
she
will
bother
me
i
know
her
son
hughie
he
of
the
bear
of
whom
i
told
you
the
lad
with
the
face
of
an
angel
and
the
temper
of
an
angel
but
of
a
different
color
her
son
hughie
she
must
make
into
a
scholar
and
no
wonder
for
already
he
has
attained
a
remarkable
degree
of
excellence
by
the
grace
not
of
the
little
log
school
however
i
venture
to
shy
his
mother
has
been
at
him
but
now
she
feels
that
something
more
is
needed
and
for
that
she
turns
to
me
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
humor
of
it
but
not
the
pathos
she
wants
to
make
a
man
out
of
her
boy
noble
gentleman
and
this
she
lays
upon
me
did
i
hear
you
laugh
smile
not
it
is
the
most
tragic
of
pathos
upon
me
jack
craven
the
despair
of
the
professors
the
terror
of
the
watch
the
alas
you
know
only
too
well
my
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
before
i
could
cry
forbid
that
i
should
have
a
hand
in
the
making
of
your
boy
she
accepted
my
pledge
to
do
her
desire
for
her
young
angel
with
the
temper
and
now
my
dear
ned
is
it
for
my
sins
that
i
am
thus
pursued
what
is
awaiting
me
i
know
not
what
i
shall
do
with
the
young
cub
i
have
not
the
ghostliest
shadow
of
an
idea
shall
i
begin
by
thrashing
him
soundly
i
have
refrained
so
far
i
hate
the
role
of
executioner
or
shall
i
teach
him
boxing
the
gloves
are
a
great
educator
and
are
at
times
what
the
padre
would
call
of
grace
but
what
will
become
of
me
shall
i
become
prematurely
aged
or
shall
i
become
a
saint
expect
anything
from
your
most
devoted
but
most
sorely
bored
and
perplexed

chapter
xii
the
downfall
in
one
point
the
master
was
a
great
disappointment
to
hughie
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
play
shinny
the
usual
challenge
had
come
up
from
the
front
with
its
more
than
usual
insolence
and
hughie
who
now
ranked
himself
among
the
big
boys
felt
the
shame
and
humiliation
to
be
intolerable
by
the
most
strenuous
exertions
he
started
the
game
going
with
the
first
fall
of
snow
but
it
was
difficult
to
work
up
any
enthusiasm
for
the
game
in
the
face
of
foxy
very
determined
and
weighty
opposition
backed
by
the
master
lazy
indifference
for
in
spite
of
hughie
contempt
and
open
sneers
foxy
had
determined
to
reopen
his
store
with
new
and
glowing
attractions
he
seemed
to
have
a
larger
command
of
capital
than
ever
and
he
added
several
very
important
departments
to
his
financial
undertaking
the
rivalry
between
hughie
and
foxy
had
become
acute
but
besides
this
there
was
in
hughie
heart
a
fierceness
and
longing
for
revenge
that
he
could
with
difficulty
control
and
though
he
felt
pretty
certain
that
in
an
encounter
with
foxy
he
would
come
off
second
best
and
though
in
consequence
he
delayed
that
encounter
as
long
as
possible
he
never
let
foxy
suspect
his
fear
of
him
and
waited
with
some
anxiety
for
the
inevitable
crisis
upon
one
thing
hughie
was
resolved
that
the
challenge
from
the
front
should
be
accepted
and
that
they
should
no
longer
bear
the
taunt
of
cowardice
but
should
make
a
try
even
though
it
meant
certain
defeat
his
first
step
had
been
the
organization
of
the
shinny
club
his
next
step
was
to
awaken
the
interest
of
the
master
but
in
vain
he
enlarged
upon
the
boastfulness
and
insolence
of
the
front
in
vain
he
recounted
the
achievements
of
their
heroes
of
old
who
in
those
brave
days
had
won
victory
and
fame
over
all
comers
for
their
school
and
county
the
master
would
not
be
roused
to
anything
more
than
a
languid
interest
in
the
game
and
this
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
for
shinny
in
the
snow
upon
the
roadway
in
front
of
the
school
was
none
too
exciting
but
from
the
day
when
the
game
was
transferred
to
the
one
saturday
afternoon
when
the
north
and
south
met
in
battle
the
indifference
vanished
for
it
turned
out
that
he
was
an
enthusiastic
skater
and
as
hughie
said
a
whirlwind
on
the
after
that
day
shinny
was
played
only
upon
the
ice
and
the
master
assuming
the
position
of
coach
instituted
a
more
scientific
style
of
game
and
worked
out
a
system
of
combined
play
that
made
even
small
boys
dangerous
opponents
to
boys
twice
their
size
and
weight
under
his
guidance
it
was
that
the
challenge
to
the
front
was
so
worded
as
to
make
the
contest
a
game
on
ice
and
to
limit
the
number
of
the
team
to
eleven
formerly
the
number
had
been
somewhat
indefinite
varying
from
fifteen
to
twenty
and
the
style
of
play
a
general
melee
hughie
was
made
captain
of
the
shinny
team
and
set
himself
under
the
direction
to
perfect
their
combination
and
team
play
the
master
unexpected
interest
in
the
shinny
game
was
the
first
and
chief
cause
of
foxy
downfall
as
leader
of
the
school
and
if
hughie
had
possessed
his
soul
in
patience
he
might
have
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
foxy
overthrow
without
involving
himself
in
the
painful
consequences
which
his
thirst
for
vengeance
and
his
vehement
desire
to
accomplish
foxy
ruin
brought
upon
him
the
story
of
the
culmination
of
the
rivalry
between
hughie
and
foxy
is
preserved
in
john
craven
second
letter
to
his
friend
edward
maitland
the
letter
also
gives
an
account
of
the
master
own
undoing
an
undoing
which
bore
fruit
to
the
end
of
his
life
dear
ned
i
hasten
to
correct
the
false
impression
my
previous
letter
must
have
conveyed
to
you
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
suggested
that
this
school
afforded
unrivaled
opportunities
for
repose
further
acquaintance
reveals
to
me
the
fact
that
it
is
the
seething
center
of
the
most
excitement
the
life
of
the
school
is
reflected
in
the
life
of
the
community
and
the
throbs
of
excitement
that
vibrate
from
the
school
are
felt
in
every
home
of
the
section
we
are
in
the
thick
of
preparations
for
a
deadly
contest
with
the
insolent
benighted
boastful
but
hitherto
triumphant
front
in
the
matter
of
shinny
you
know
my
antipathy
to
violent
sports
and
you
will
find
some
difficulty
in
picturing
me
an
enthusiastic
trainer
and
general
director
of
the
twentieth
team
flying
about
wildly
gesticulating
with
a
club
and
shrieking
orders
imprecations
cautions
encouragements
in
the
most
frantic
manner
at
as
furious
a
company
of
little
devils
as
ever
went
joyously
to
battle
then
as
if
this
were
not
excitement
enough
i
am
made
the
unwitting
spectator
of
a
truly
homeric
contest
bloodier
by
far
than
many
of
those
fought
on
the
plains
of
windy
troy
between
the
rival
leaders
of
the
school
to
wit
hughie
of
the
angelic
face
and
temper
and
an
older
and
much
heavier
boy
who
rejoices
in
the
cognomen
of
as
being
accurately
descriptive
at
once
of
the
brilliance
of
his
foliage
and
of
his
financial
tactics
it
appears
that
for
many
months
this
rivalry
has
existed
but
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
more
in
the
struggle
than
appears
on
the
surface
there
is
some
dark
and
deadly
mystery
behind
it
all
that
only
adds
of
course
to
the
thrilling
interest
it
holds
for
me
long
before
i
arrived
on
the
arena
which
was
an
open
space
in
the
woods
in
front
of
what
foxy
calls
his
store
wild
shrieks
and
yells
fell
upon
my
ears
as
if
the
aboriginal
denizens
of
the
forest
had
returned
quietly
approaching
i
soon
guessed
the
nature
of
the
excitement
and
being
unwilling
to
interfere
until
i
had
thoroughly
grasped
the
ethical
and
other
import
of
the
situation
i
shinned
up
a
tree
and
from
this
point
of
vantage
took
in
the
spectacle
it
appeared
from
foxy
violent
accusations
that
hughie
had
been
guilty
of
wrecking
the
store
which
by
the
way
the
latter
utterly
despises
and
contemns
the
following
interesting
and
striking
conversation
took
place
are
you
doing
in
my
store
anyway
says
he
of
the
brilliant
foliage
just
a
thief
that
what
you
are
and
a
sneaking
thief
promptly
the
lie
comes
back
was
touching
your
rotten
stuff
and
again
the
lie
is
exchanged
immediately
there
is
demand
from
the
spectators
that
the
matter
be
argued
to
a
demonstration
and
thereupon
one
of
the
larger
boys
wishing
to
precipitate
matters
and
to
furnish
a
casus
belli
puts
a
chip
upon
hughie
shoulder
and
dares
foxy
to
knock
it
off
but
hughie
flings
the
chip
aside
away
with
yourself
and
your
chip
i
not
going
to
fight
for
any
chip
yells
of
derision
cowardy
custard
him
a
good
cuffing
foxy
afraid
and
so
forth
and
indeed
hughie
appears
none
too
anxious
to
prove
his
innocence
and
integrity
upon
the
big
and
solid
body
of
his
antagonist
foxy
much
encouraged
by
the
clamor
of
his
friends
deploys
in
force
in
front
of
his
foe
shouting
on
you
little
thief
not
a
thief
i
did
touch
one
of
your
things
you
touched
my
things
or
not
you
a
thief
anyway
and
you
know
you
are
you
stole
money
and
i
know
it
and
you
know
it
yourself
to
this
hughie
strangely
enough
makes
no
reply
wherein
lies
the
mystery
but
though
he
makes
no
reply
he
faces
up
boldly
to
foxy
and
offers
battle
this
is
evidently
a
surprise
to
foxy
who
contents
himself
with
threats
as
to
what
he
can
do
with
his
one
hand
tied
behind
his
back
and
what
he
will
do
in
a
minute
while
hughie
waits
wasting
no
strength
upon
words
finally
foxy
strides
to
his
store
door
and
apparently
urged
to
frenzy
by
the
sight
of
the
wreckage
therein
comes
back
and
lands
a
sharp
cuff
on
his
antagonist
ear
it
is
all
that
is
needed
as
if
he
had
touched
a
spring
hughie
flew
at
him
wildly
inconsequently
making
a
windmill
of
his
arms
but
fortunately
he
runs
foul
of
one
of
foxy
big
fists
and
falls
back
with
spouting
nose
enthusiastic
yells
from
foxy
following
and
foxy
having
done
much
better
than
he
expected
is
encouraged
to
pursue
his
advantage
meantime
the
blood
is
being
mopped
off
hughie
face
with
a
snowball
his
tears
flowing
equally
with
his
blood
till
urges
fusie
his
little
french
fidus
achates
yells
hughie
suddenly
but
now
i
kill
the
lying
sneaking
beast
now
or
i
die
myself
after
which
heroic
resolve
he
flings
himself
blood
and
tears
upon
the
waiting
foxy
and
this
time
with
better
result
for
foxy
waiting
the
attack
with
arms
up
and
eyes
shut
finds
himself
pummeled
all
over
the
face
and
after
a
few
moments
of
ineffectual
resistance
turns
and
in
quite
the
homeric
way
seeks
safety
in
flight
followed
by
the
furious
and
vengeful
achilles
and
the
jeering
shouts
of
the
bloodthirsty
but
disappointed
rabble
as
i
have
said
the
mystery
behind
it
remains
unsolved
but
reign
is
at
an
end
and
with
him
goes
the
store
for
which
i
am
devoutly
thankful
i
would
my
tale
ended
here
with
the
downfall
of
foxy
but
my
dear
ned
i
have
to
record
a
sadder
and
more
humiliating
downfall
than
that
the
abject
and
utter
collapse
of
my
noble
self
i
have
once
more
played
the
fool
and
played
into
the
hands
of
the
devil
mine
own
familiar
and
devil
the
occasion
i
need
not
enlarge
upon
it
always
waits
a
long
skate
a
late
supper
with
some
of
the
wilder
and
more
reckless
outcasts
of
this
community
that
frequent
the
back
store
results
in
my
appearing
at
the
manse
door
late
at
night
very
unsteady
of
leg
and
incoherent
of
speech
by
a
most
unhappy
chance
a
most
scurvy
trick
my
familiar
devil
played
upon
me
the
door
is
opened
by
the
wife
i
can
see
her
look
of
fear
horror
and
loathing
yet
it
did
more
to
pull
me
together
than
a
cold
bath
so
that
i
saved
myself
the
humiliation
of
speech
and
escaped
to
my
room
and
now
what
do
you
think
reproaches
objurgations
and
final
dismissal
on
the
part
of
the
padre
tearful
exhortations
to
repentance
on
the
part
of
his
wife
not
a
bit
if
you
believe
me
sir
my
unhappy
misadventure
remains
a
secret
with
her
she
told
not
a
soul
remarkably
fine
i
call
that
and
what
more
think
you
a
cold
and
haughty
reserve
or
a
lofty
pity
with
the
fearful
expectation
of
judgment
not
in
the
least
only
a
little
added
kindness
a
deeper
note
to
the
frank
sympathetic
interest
she
has
always
shown
and
that
is
all
my
dear
chap
i
offered
to
leave
but
when
she
looked
at
me
with
those
great
eyes
of
hers
and
said
should
you
go
would
it
be
better
for
you
any
place
else
i
found
myself
enjoying
the
luxury
of
an
entirely
new
set
of
emotions
which
i
shall
not
analyze
to
you
but
i
feel
more
confident
than
ever
that
i
shall
either
die
early
or
end
in
being
a
saint
and
now
do
you
know
she
persists
in
ignoring
that
anything
has
taken
place
talks
to
me
about
her
young
men
and
her
hopes
for
them
the
work
she
would
do
for
them
and
actually
asks
my
assistance
it
appears
that
ever
since
their
great
revival
which
is
the
beginning
of
days
to
them
events
being
dated
from
before
the
great
revival
or
after
some
of
these
young
men
have
a
desire
to
be
ministers
or
think
they
have
it
is
really
her
desire
i
suspect
for
them
the
difficulty
is
preparation
for
college
in
this
she
asks
my
help
the
enormous
incongruity
of
the
situation
does
not
appear
to
strike
her
that
i
the
too
many
unutterable
things
should
be
asked
to
prepare
these
young
giants
with
their
religious
convictions
for
the
ministry
nevertheless
i
yield
myself
to
do
anything
and
everything
she
lays
upon
me
i
repeat
i
shall
without
doubt
end
in

chapter
xiii
the
first
round
the
challenge
from
the
front
was
for
the
best
two
out
of
three
the
first
game
to
be
played
the
last
day
of
the
year
steadily
under
craven
coaching
the
twentieth
team
were
perfected
in
their
systematic
play
for
although
craven
knew
nothing
of
shinny
he
had
captained
the
champion
lacrosse
team
of
the
province
of
quebec
and
the
same
general
rules
of
defense
and
attack
could
be
applied
with
equal
success
to
the
game
of
shinny
the
team
was
greatly
strengthened
by
the
accession
of
thomas
finch
and
don
cameron
both
of
whom
took
up
the
school
again
with
a
view
to
college
with
thomas
in
goal
hughie
said
he
felt
as
if
a
big
hole
had
been
filled
up
behind
him
the
master
caused
a
few
preliminary
skirmishes
with
neighboring
teams
to
be
played
by
way
of
practice
and
by
the
time
the
end
of
the
year
had
come
he
felt
confident
that
the
team
would
not
disgrace
their
school
his
confidence
was
not
we
have
covered
ourselves
with
glory
he
writes
to
his
friend
ned
maitland
for
we
have
whipped
to
a
finish
the
arrogant
and
mighty
front
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
that
i
shall
have
to
take
a
few
days
off
and
get
away
to
montreal
or
some
other
retired
spot
to
recover
from
the
excitement
of
the
last
week
under
my
diligent
coaching
in
which
knowing
nothing
whatever
of
shinny
i
have
striven
to
introduce
something
of
the
lacrosse
method
our
team
got
into
really
decent
fighting
trim
under
the
leadership
of
their
captain
who
has
succeeded
in
infusing
his
own
fierce
and
furious
temper
into
his
men
they
played
like
little
demons
from
the
drop
of
the
ball
till
the
game
was
scored
is
the
word
for
they
and
their
captain
play
with
headlong
fury
and
that
i
might
say
is
about
their
only
defect
for
if
they
ever
should
run
into
a
bigger
team
who
had
any
semblance
of
head
about
them
and
were
not
merely
feet
they
would
surely
come
to
grief
i
can
not
stay
to
recount
our
victory
let
it
suffice
that
we
were
driven
down
in
two
big
by
thomas
finch
the
back
wall
of
our
defense
and
don
cameron
who
plays
in
the
right
of
the
forward
line
both
great
strapping
fellows
who
are
to
be
eventually
i
believe
members
of
my
preparatory
class
the
front
came
forth
cheerful
big
confident
trusting
in
the
might
of
their
legs
we
are
told
that
the
lord
taketh
no
pleasure
in
the
legs
of
man
and
this
is
true
in
the
game
of
shinny
not
legs
alone
but
heart
and
head
win
with
anything
like
equal
chances

hughie

and

my
little

pierce
the
heavy

and
score
the
enemy
big
and
bewildered
being
chiefly
occupied
in
watching
them
do
it
by
six
that
evening
i
had
them
safe
at
the
manse
in
a
condition
of
dazed
jubilation
quite
unable
to
realize
the
magnificence
of
their
achievement
they
had
driven
twelve
miles
down
played
a
two
hours
game
of
shinny
score
eight
to
two
and
were
back
safe
and
sound
bearing
with
them
victory
and
some
broken
shins
equally
proud
of
both
there
is
a
big
supper
at
the
manse
prepared
i
believe
with
the
view
of
consolation
but
transformed
into
a
feast
of
triumph
the
minister
being
enthusiastically
jubilant
over
the
achievement
of
his
boys
his
wife
if
possible
even
more
so
the
heroes
feed
themselves
to
fullness
amazing
and
complete
the
minister
holds
a
thanksgiving
service
in
which
i
have
no
doubt
my
little
demons
most
earnestly
join
after
which
they
depart
to
shed
the
radiance
of
their
glory
throughout
the
section
and
now
i
have
to
recount
another
experience
of
mine
quite
unique
and
altogether
inexplicable
it
appears
that
in
this
remarkable
abode
i
would
call
it
saint
rest
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
others
than
saints
and
for
the
additional
fact
that
there
is
little
rest
for
the
saint
who
makes
her
dwelling
here
in
this
abode
there
prevails
the
quaint
custom
of
watching
the
death
of
the
old
year
and
the
birth
of
the
new
it
is
made
the
occasion
of
religious
and
rite
as
the
solemn
hour
of
midnight
draws
on
a
silence
falls
upon
the
family
all
of
whom
with
the
exception
of
the
newest
infant
are
present
it
is
the
family
festival
of
the
year
what
will
they
be
doing
at
your
home
mr
craven
inquires
the
minister
the
contrast
that
rose
before
my
mind
was
vivid
enough
for
having
received
my
invitation
to
a
big
dance
i
knew
my
sweet
sisters
would
be
having
a
jolly
wild
time
about
that
moment
my
answer
given
i
feel
in
a
somewhat
flippant
tone
appears
to
shock
my
shinny
captain
of
the
angelic
face
who
casts
a
glance
at
his
mother
and
waits
for
the
word
of
reproof
that
he
thinks
is
due
from
the
lips
but
before
it
falls
the
mother
interposes
with
will
miss
you
greatly
this
evening
it
was
rather
neatly
done
and
i
think
i
appreciated
it
the
rite
proceeds
the
initial
ceremony
is
the
repeating
of
a
verse
of
scripture
all
round
and
to
save
my
life
nothing
comes
to
my
mind
but
the
words
lot
wife
as
i
can
not
see
the
appropriateness
of
the
quotation
i
pass
five
minutes
before
the
stroke
of
twelve
they
sing
the
scottish
paraphrase
beginning
god
of
bethel
i
do
not
suppose
you
ever
heard
it
but
it
is
a
beautiful
hymn
and
singularly
appropriate
to
the
hour
in
this
i
lend
assistance
with
my
violin
the
tune
being
the
very
familiar
one
of
lang
syne
associated
in
my
mind
however
with
occasions
somewhat
widely
diverse
from
this
i
assure
you
i
am
thankful
that
my
part
is
instrumental
for
the
whole
business
is
getting
onto
my
emotions
in
a
disturbing
manner
and
especially
when
i
allow
my
eyes
to
linger
for
a
moment
or
two
on
the
face
of
the
lady
the
center
of
the
circle
who
is
deliberately
throwing
away
her
fine
culture
and
her
altogether
beautiful
soul
upon
the
anakim
here
and
with
a
beautiful
unconsciousness
of
anything
like
sacrifice
is
now
thanking
god
for
the
privilege
of
doing
so
i
have
some
moments
of
rare
emotional
luxury
those
moments
that
are
next
to
tears
then
the
padre
offers
one
of
those
prayers
of
his
that
whether
they
reach
anything
outside
or
not
somehow
get
down
into
one
vitals
and
stir
up
remorses
and
and
longings
unutterable
then
they
all
kiss
the
mother
and
wish
her
a
happy
my
boy
my
dear
boy
i
have
never
known
deeper
moments
than
those
and
when
i
went
to
shake
hands
with
her
she
seemed
so
like
a
queen
receiving
homage
that
without
seeming
to
feel
i
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
i
did
the
queen
victoria
act
and
saluted
her
hand
it
is
wonderful
how
great
moments
discover
the
lady
to
you
she
must
have
known
how
i
was
feeling
for
with
a
very
beautiful
grace
she
said
me
be
your
mother
for
and
by
jove
she
kissed
me
i
have
been
kissed
before
and
have
kissed
some
women
in
my
time
but
that
is
the
only
kiss
i
can
remember
and
me
bob
i
never
kiss
another
till
i
kiss
my
wife
and
then
and
there
maitland
i
swore
by
all
that
i
knew
of
god
and
by
everything
sacred
in
life
that
i
quit
the
past
and
be
worthy
of
her
trust
for
the
mischief
of
it
is
she
will
persist
in
trusting
you
puts
you
on
your
honor
noblesse
oblige
business
and
all
that
i
think
i
told
you
that
i
might
end
in
being
a
saint
that
dream
i
have
surrendered
but
by
the
grace
of
heaven
i
going
to
try
to
be
a
man
and
i
am
going
to
play
shinny
with
those
boys
and
if
i
can
help
them
to
win
that
match
and
the
big
game
of
life
i
will
do
it
as
witness
my
hand
and
seal
this
first
day
of
january
j
chapter
xiv
the
final
round
after
the
the
school
filled
up
with
big
boys
some
of
whom
had
returned
with
the
idea
of
joining
the
preparatory
class
for
college
which
the
minister
had
persuaded
john
craven
to
organize
shinny
however
became
the
absorbing
interest
for
all
the
boys
both
big
and
little
this
interest
was
intensified
by
the
rumors
that
came
up
from
the
front
for
it
was
noised
through
the
twentieth
section
that
dan
munro
whose
father
was
a
cousin
of
archie
munro
the
former
teacher
had
come
from
marrintown
and
taken
charge
of
the
front
school
and
that
being
used
to
the
ice
game
and
being
full
of
tricks
and
swift
as
a
bird
he
was
an
exceedingly
dangerous
man
more
than
that
he
was
training
his
team
with
his
own
tricks
and
had
got
back
to
school
some
of
the
old
players
among
whom
were
no
less
renowned
personages
than
hec
ross
and
jimmie
jimmie
ben
to
wit
james
son
of
benjamin
mcewen
was
more
famed
for
his
prowess
as
a
fighter
than
for
his
knowledge
of
the
game
of
shinny
but
every
one
who
saw
him
play
said
he
was
a
further
it
was
rumored
that
there
was
a
chance
of
them
getting
for
goal
farquhar
mcrae
little
farquhar
or
farquhar
bheg
pronounced
vaick
as
he
was
euphoniously
called
who
presumably
had
once
been
little
but
could
no
longer
claim
to
be
so
seeing
that
he
was
six
feet
and
weighed
two
hundred
pounds
it
behooved
the
twentieth
team
therefore
to
bestir
themselves
with
all
diligence
and
in
this
matter
hughie
gave
no
rest
either
to
himself
or
to
any
one
else
likely
to
be
of
use
in
perfecting
his
team
for
hughie
had
been
unanimously
chosen
captain
in
spite
of
his
protests
that
the
master
or
one
of
the
big
boys
should
hold
that
place
but
none
of
the
big
boys
knew
the
new
game
as
perfectly
as
hughie
and
the
master
had
absolutely
refused
saying
you
beat
them
once
hughie
and
you
can
do
it
and
as
the
days
and
weeks
went
on
hughie
fully
justified
the
team
choice
of
him
as
captain
he
developed
a
genius
for
organization
a
sureness
of
judgment
and
a
tact
in
management
as
well
as
a
skill
and
speed
in
play
that
won
the
confidence
of
every
member
of
his
team
he
set
himself
resolutely
to
banish
any
remaining
relics
of
the
ancient
style
of
play
in
the
old
game
every
one
rushed
to
hit
the
ball
without
regard
to
direction
or
distance
and
the
consequence
was
that
from
end
to
end
of
the
field
a
mob
of
yelling
players
more
or
less
aimlessly
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
ball
but
hughie
and
the
master
changed
all
that
forced
the
men
to
play
in
their
positions
training
them
never
to
drive
wildly
forward
but
to
pass
to
a
man
and
to
keep
their
clubs
down
and
their
mouths
shut
the
striking
characteristic
of
hughie
own
playing
was
a
certain
fierceness
amounting
almost
to
fury
so
that
when
he
was
in
the
attack
he
played
for
every
ounce
there
was
in
him
his
chief
weakness
lay
in
his
tempestuous
temper
which
he
found
difficult
to
command
but
as
he
worked
his
men
from
day
to
day
and
week
to
week
the
responsibility
of
his
position
and
the
magnitude
of
the
issues
at
stake
helped
him
to
a
quite
remarkable
in
him
as
the
fateful
day
drew
near
the
whole
section
was
stirred
with
an
intense
interest
and
excitement
in
which
even
the
grave
and
solemn
elders
shared
and
to
a
greater
degree
the
minister
and
his
wife
at
length
the
day
as
all
days
great
and
small
actually
arrived
a
big
crowd
awaited
the
appearance
of
the
folks
from
the
they
were
expected
about
two
but
it
was
not
till
that
there
was
heard
in
the
distance
the
sound
of
the
bagpipes
here
they
are
that
alan
the
cooper
pipes
was
the
cry
and
before
long
sure
enough
there
appeared
alphonse
le
roque
driving
his
team
the
joy
and
pride
of
his
heart
for
alphonse
was
a
born
and
had
taught
his
many
extraordinary
tricks
on
the
dead
gallop
he
approached
the
crowd
till
within
a
few
yards
when
at
a
sudden
command
they
threw
themselves
upon
their
haunches
and
came
almost
to
a
standstill
with
a
crack
of
his
long
whip
alphonse
gave
the
command
deesplay
yousef
at
once
his
stout
little
team
began
to
toss
their
beautiful
heads
and
broke
into
a
series
of
prancing
curves
that
would
not
have
shamed
a
pair
of
greyhounds
then
as
they
drew
up
to
the
he
gathered
up
his
lines
and
with
another
crack
of
his
whip
cried
salute
ze
ladies
when
with
true
equine
courtesy
they
rose
upon
their
hind
legs
and
gracefully
pawed
the
empty
air
finally
after
depositing
his
load
amid
the
admiring
exclamations
of
the
crowd
he
touched
their
tails
with
the
point
of
his
whip
gave
a
sudden
whish
and
like
hounds
from
the
leash
his
horses
sprang
off
at
full
gallop
one
after
another
the
teams
from
the
front
swung
round
and
emptied
their
loads
man
what
a
crowd
said
hughie
to
don
there
must
be
a
hundred
at
yes
and
there
hec
ross
and
jimmie
ben
said
don
and
sure
enough
farquhar
begh
we
be
catching
it
whatever
continued
don
cheerfully
pshaw
we
licked
as
big
men
before
it
is
size
said
hughie
with
far
more
confidence
than
he
felt
it
was
half
an
hour
before
the
players
were
ready
to
begin
the
rules
of
the
game
were
few
and
simple
the
play
was
to
be
one
hour
each
way
with
a
quarter
of
an
hour
rest
between
there
was
to
be
no
tripping
no
hitting
on
the
shins
when
the
ball
was
out
of
the
scrimmage
and
all
disputes
were
to
be
settled
by
the
umpire
who
on
this
occasion
was
the
master
of
the
sixteenth
school
he
no
good
grumbled
hughie
to
his
mother
who
was
even
more
excited
than
her
boy
himself
he
ca
play
himself
and
he
too
easy
never
mind
said
his
mother
brightly
perhaps
he
wo
have
much
to
much
to
do
well
there
jimmie
ben
and
he
an
awful
fighter
but
i
not
going
to
let
him
frighten
me
said
hughie
savagely
and
there
dan
munro
too
they
say
he
a
terror
and
hec
ross
of
course
we
got
just
as
good
men
but
they
wo
fight
why
johnnie
duncan
and
don
there
are
as
good
as
any
of
them
but
they
the
mother
smiled
a
little
what
a
pity
but
why
should
they
fight
fighting
is
not
no
that
what
the
master
says
and
he
right
enough
too
but
awful
hard
when
a
fellow
does
play
fair
when
he
trips
you
up
or
clubs
you
on
the
shins
when
you
not
near
the
ball
you
feel
like
hitting
him
yes
but
that
the
very
time
to
show
i
know
and
that
what
the
master
of
course
it
is
went
on
his
mother
that
what
the
game
is
for
to
teach
the
boys
to
command
their
tempers
you
remember
that
ruleth
his
spirit
is
better
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
o
it
all
right
said
hughie
and
easy
enough
to
talk
what
easy
enough
to
talk
about
asked
the
master
coming
up
taking
a
city
said
murray
smiling
at
him
the
master
looked
puzzled
mother
means
said
hughie
keeping
one
temper
in
shinny
but
telling
her
it
pretty
hard
when
a
fellow
clubs
you
on
the
shins
when
you
away
from
the
yes
of
course
it
hard
said
the
master
but
it
better
than
being
a
cad
which
brought
a
quick
flush
to
hughie
face
but
helped
him
more
than
anything
else
to
keep
himself
in
hand
that
day
ca
understand
a
man
said
the
master
who
goes
into
a
game
and
then
quits
it
to
fight
if
it
fighting
why
fight
but
if
it
shinny
play
the
game
big
team
against
us
eh
captain
he
continued
looking
at
the
front
men
who
were
taking
a
preliminary
spin
upon
the
ice
and
pretty
swift
if
they
play
fair
i
do
mind
said
hughie
i
not
afraid
of
them
but
if
they
get
slugging
well
if
they
get
slugging
said
the
master
we
play
the
game
and
win
well
it
time
to
begin
said
hughie
and
with
a
good
by
to
his
mother
he
turned
away
remember
take
a
city
she
called
out
after
him
all
right
muzzie
i
in
a
few
moments
the
teams
were
in
position
opposite
each
other
the
team
from
the
front
made
a
formidable
show
in
weight
and
muscle
at
the
right
of
the
forward
line
stood
the
redoubtable
dan
munro
the
stocky
tricky
fierce
captain
of
the
front
team
and
with
him
three
rather
small
boys
in
red
shirts
the
defense
consisted
of
hec
ross
the
and
jimmie
ben
while
in
goal
sure
enough
stood
the
immense
and
solid
bulk
of
farquhar
bheg
the
center
was
held
by
four
boys
of
fair
size
and
weight
in
the
twentieth
team
the
forward
line
was
composed
of
jack
ross
curly
ross
brother
fusie
davie
scotch
and
don
cameron
the
center
was
played
by
hughie
with
three
little
chaps
who
made
up
for
their
lack
of
weight
by
their
speed
and
skill
the
defense
consisted
of
johnnie
big
duncan
to
wit
john
the
son
of
big
duncan
campbell
on
the
left
hand
and
the
master
on
the
right
backed
up
by
thomas
finch
in
goal
who
much
against
his
will
was
in
the
game
that
day
his
heart
was
heavy
within
him
for
he
saw
not
the
gleaming
ice
and
the
crowding
players
but
the
room
at
home
and
his
mother
with
her
pale
patient
face
sitting
in
her
chair
his
father
he
knew
would
be
beside
her
and
jessac
would
be
flitting
about
but
for
all
that
she
have
a
long
day
he
said
to
himself
for
only
his
loyalty
to
the
school
and
to
hughie
had
brought
him
to
the
game
that
day
when
play
was
called
hughie
with
fusie
immediately
behind
him
stood
facing
dan
in
the
center
with
one
of
the
little
red
shirts
at
his
back
it
was
dan
drop
he
made
a
pass
or
two
then
shot
between
his
legs
to
a
red
shirt
who
upon
receiving
passed
far
out
to
red
shirt
number
three
who
flew
along
the
outer
edge
and
returned
swiftly
to
dan
now
far
up
the
other
side
like
the
wind
dan
sped
down
the
line
dodged
johnnie
big
duncan
easily
and
shot
from
the
corner
straight
swift
and
true
a
goal
one
for
the
front
eleven
went
up
in
the
air
the
bagpipes
struck
up
a
wild
refrain
big
hec
ross
and
jimmie
ben
danced
a
huge
unwieldy
but
altogether
jubilant
dance
round
each
other
and
then
settled
down
to
their
places
for
it
was
hughie
drop
hughie
took
the
ball
from
the
umpire
and
faced
dan
with
some
degree
of
nervousness
for
dan
was
heavy
and
strong
and
full
of
confidence
after
a
little
manoeuvering
he
dropped
the
ball
between
dan
legs
but
dan
instead
of
attending
to
the
ball
charged
full
upon
him
and
laid
him
flat
while
one
of
the
red
shirts
seizing
the
ball
flew
off
with
it
supported
by
a
friendly
red
shirt
on
either
side
of
him
with
dan
following
hard
right
through
the
crowd
dodged
the
red
shirts
till
they
came
up
to
the
twentieth
line
of
defense
when
forth
came
johnnie
big
duncan
in
swift
attack
but
the
little
red
shirt
who
had
the
ball
touching
it
slightly
to
the
right
tangled
himself
up
in
johnnie
big
duncan
legs
and
sent
him
sprawling
while
dan
swiped
the
ball
to
another
red
shirt
who
had
slipped
in
behind
the
master
for
there
was
no
such
foolishness
as
in
that
game
like
lightning
the
red
shirt
caught
the
ball
and
rushing
at
thomas
shot
furiously
at
close
quarters
goal
number
two
for
the
front
again
on
all
sides
rose
frantic
cheers
the
front
the
front
murro
forever
two
games
had
been
won
and
not
a
twentieth
man
had
touched
the
ball
with
furtive
uncertain
glances
the
men
of
the
twentieth
team
looked
one
at
the
other
and
all
at
their
captain
as
if
seeking
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
situation
well
said
hughie
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
master
and
with
a
careless
laugh
though
at
his
heart
he
was
desperate
they
are
giving
us
a
little
taste
of
our
own
the
master
dropped
to
buckle
his
skate
deliberately
unwinding
the
strap
while
the
umpire
allowed
time
give
me
a
hand
with
this
hughie
he
called
and
hughie
skated
up
to
him
well
said
craven
smiling
up
into
hughie
face
that
a
good
swift
opening
is
it
oh
it
terrible
groaned
hughie
they
going
to
lick
us
off
the
well
replied
the
master
slowly
i
would
be
in
a
hurry
to
say
so
we
have
a
hundred
minutes
and
more
to
win
in
yet
now
do
you
see
that
their
captain
is
their
great
card
suppose
you
let
the
ball
go
for
a
game
or
two
and
stick
to
dan
trail
him
never
let
him
shake
you
the
rest
of
us
will
take
care
of
the
all
right
said
hughie
i
stick
to
him
and
off
he
set
for
the
center
as
the
loser
hughie
again
held
the
drop
he
faced
dan
with
determination
to
get
that
ball
out
to
fusie
and
somehow
he
felt
in
his
bones
that
he
should
succeed
in
doing
this
without
any
preliminary
he
dropped
and
knocked
the
ball
toward
fusie
but
this
was
evidently
what
dan
expected
for
as
soon
as
hughie
made
the
motion
to
drop
he
charged
hard
upon
the
waiting
fusie
hughie
however
had
his
plan
as
well
for
immediately
upon
the
ball
leaving
his
stick
he
threw
himself
in
dan
way
checking
him
effectually
and
allowing
fusie
with
don
and
scotchie
following
to
get
away
the
front
defense
however
was
too
strong
and
the
ball
came
shooting
back
toward
the
line
of
reds
one
of
whom
making
a
short
run
passed
far
out
to
dan
on
the
right
but
before
the
latter
could
get
up
speed
hughie
was
upon
him
and
ignoring
the
ball
blocked
and
bothered
and
checked
him
till
one
of
the
twentieth
centers
rushing
in
secured
it
for
his
side
ha
well
done
captain
came
craven
voice
across
the
ice
and
hughie
felt
his
nerve
come
back
if
he
could
hold
dan
that
deadly
front
combination
might
be
broken
meantime
don
had
secured
the
ball
from
craven
and
was
rushing
up
his
right
wing
here
you
are
hughie
he
cried
shooting
across
the
front
goal
hughie
sprang
to
receive
but
before
he
could
shoot
dan
was
upon
him
checking
so
hard
that
hughie
was
sent
sprawling
to
the
ice
while
dan
shot
away
with
the
ball
but
before
he
had
gone
very
far
hughie
was
after
him
like
a
whirlwind
making
straight
for
his
own
goal
so
that
by
the
time
dan
had
arrived
at
shooting
distance
hughie
was
again
upon
him
and
while
in
the
very
act
of
steadying
himself
for
his
try
at
the
goal
came
crashing
into
him
with
such
fierceness
of
attack
that
dan
was
flung
aside
while
johnnie
big
duncan
capturing
the
ball
sent
it
across
to
the
master
it
was
the
master
first
chance
for
the
day
with
amazing
swiftness
and
dexterity
he
threaded
the
outer
edge
of
the
ice
and
with
a
sudden
swerve
across
avoided
the
throng
that
had
gathered
to
oppose
him
and
then
with
a
careless
ease
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
little
importance
he
dodged
in
between
the
heavy
front
defense
shot
his
goal
and
skated
back
coolly
to
his
place
the
twentieth
moment
had
come
and
both
upon
the
ice
and
upon
the
banks
the
volume
and
fierceness
of
the
cheering
testified
to
the
intensity
of
the
feeling
that
had
been
so
long
pent
up
that
game
had
revealed
to
hughie
two
important
facts
the
first
that
he
was
faster
than
dan
in
a
straight
race
and
the
second
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
feed
the
master
for
it
was
clearly
apparent
that
there
was
not
his
equal
upon
the
ice
in
dodging
that
was
well
done
captain
said
craven
to
hughie
as
he
was
coolly
skating
back
to
his
position
a
splendid
run
sir
cried
hughie
in
return
oh
the
run
was
easy
it
was
your
check
there
that
did
the
trick
that
the
game
he
continued
lowering
his
voice
it
hard
on
you
though
can
you
stand
it
well
i
can
try
for
a
while
said
hughie
confidently
if
you
can
said
the
master
we
got
them
and
hughie
settled
down
into
the
resolve
that
cost
what
it
might
he
would
stick
like
a
leech
to
dan
he
imparted
his
plan
to
fusie
adding
now
whenever
you
see
me
tackle
dan
run
in
and
get
the
ball
i
not
going
to
bother
about
half
an
hour
had
gone
the
score
stood
two
to
one
in
favor
of
the
front
but
the
result
every
one
felt
to
be
still
uncertain
that
last
attack
of
hughie
and
the
master
speedy
performance
gave
some
concern
to
the
men
of
the
front
and
awakened
a
feeling
of
confidence
in
the
twentieth
team
but
dan
wise
general
that
he
was
saw
the
danger
and
gave
his
commands
ere
he
faced
off
for
the
new
game
when
that
man
craven
gets
it
he
said
to
the
men
of
the
center
make
straight
for
the
goal
never
mind
the
the
wisdom
of
this
order
became
at
once
evident
for
when
in
the
he
secured
the
ball
hughie
clung
so
tenaciously
to
his
heels
and
checked
him
so
effectually
that
he
was
forced
to
resign
it
to
the
reds
who
piercing
the
twentieth
center
managed
to
scurry
up
the
ice
with
the
ball
between
them
but
when
met
by
craven
and
johnnie
big
duncan
they
passed
across
to
dan
hughie
again
checked
so
fiercely
that
johnnie
big
duncan
secured
the
ball
passed
back
to
the
master
who
with
another
meteoric
flash
along
the
edge
of
the
field
broke
through
the
front
defense
and
again
shot
it
was
only
farquhar
bheg
steady
coolness
that
saved
the
goal
it
was
a
near
enough
thing
however
to
strike
a
sudden
chill
to
the
heart
of
the
front
and
to
make
dan
realize
that
something
must
be
done
to
check
these
dangerous
rushes
of
craven
get
in
behind
the
defense
there
and
stay
there
he
said
to
two
of
his
centers
and
his
tone
indicated
that
his
serene
confidence
in
himself
and
his
team
was
slightly
shaken
hughie
close
checking
was
beginning
to
chafe
him
for
his
team
in
their
practice
had
learned
to
depend
unduly
upon
him
noticing
dan
change
in
the
disposition
of
his
men
hughie
moved
up
two
of
his
centers
nearer
to
the
front
defense
get
into
their
way
he
said
and
give
the
master
a
clear
but
this
policy
only
assisted
dan
plan
of
defense
for
the
presence
of
so
many
players
before
the
front
goal
filled
up
the
ice
to
such
an
extent
that
craven
rushes
were
impeded
by
mere
numbers
for
some
time
dan
watched
the
result
of
his
tactics
well
satisfied
remaining
himself
for
the
time
in
the
background
during
one
of
the
pauses
when
the
ball
was
out
of
play
he
called
one
of
the
little
reds
to
him
look
here
he
said
you
watch
this
right
after
one
of
those
rushes
of
craven
do
follow
him
down
but
keep
up
to
your
position
get
the
ball
to
you
somehow
and
then
you
have
a
chance
to
shoot
no
use
passing
to
me
for
this
little
son
of
a
gun
is
on
my
back
like
a
flea
on
a
dan
was
seriously
annoyed
the
little
red
passed
the
word
around
and
patiently
waited
his
chance
once
and
again
the
plan
failed
chiefly
because
dan
could
not
get
the
ball
out
of
the
scrimmage
but
at
length
when
hughie
had
been
tempted
to
rush
in
with
the
hope
of
putting
in
a
shot
the
ball
slid
out
of
the
scrimmage
and
dan
swooping
down
upon
it
passed
swiftly
to
the
waiting
red
who
immediately
shot
far
out
to
his
alert
wing
and
then
rushing
down
the
center
and
slipping
past
johnnie
big
duncan
who
had
gone
forth
to
meet
dan
coming
down
the
right
and
the
master
who
was
attending
to
the
little
red
on
the
wing
received
the
ball
and
putting
in
a
short
swift
shot
scored
another
goal
for
the
front
amid
a
tempest
of
hurrahings
from
the
team
and
their
supporters
the
game
now
stood
three
to
one
in
favor
of
the
front
and
up
to
the
end
of
the
first
hour
no
change
was
made
in
this
score
and
now
there
was
a
scene
of
the
wildest
enthusiasm
and
confusion
the
front
people
flocked
upon
the
ice
and
carried
off
their
team
to
their
quarter
of
the
shanty
loading
them
with
congratulations
and
refreshing
them
with
various
drinks
better
get
your
men
together
captain
suggested
craven
and
hughie
gathered
them
into
the
twentieth
corner
of
the
shanty
in
spite
of
the
adverse
score
hughie
found
his
team
full
of
fight
they
crowded
about
him
and
the
master
eager
to
listen
to
any
explanation
of
the
present
defeat
that
might
be
offered
for
their
comfort
or
to
any
plans
by
which
the
defeat
might
be
turned
into
victory
some
minutes
they
spent
in
excitedly
discussing
the
various
games
and
in
chaffing
thomas
finch
for
his
failure
to
prevent
a
score
but
thomas
had
nothing
to
say
in
reply
he
had
done
his
best
and
he
had
a
feeling
that
they
all
knew
it
no
man
was
held
in
higher
esteem
by
the
team
than
the
any
plan
captain
asked
the
master
after
they
had
talked
for
some
minutes
and
all
grew
quiet
what
do
you
think
sir
said
hughie
o
let
us
hear
from
you
you
the
well
said
hughie
slowly
and
with
deliberate
emphasis
i
think
we
are
going
to
yells
from
all
sides
at
any
rate
we
ought
to
win
for
i
think
we
have
the
better
more
yells
what
i
mean
is
this
i
think
we
are
better
in
combination
play
and
i
do
think
they
have
a
man
who
can
touch
the
enthusiastic
exclamations
that
right
better
believe
it
horo
but
we
have
a
big
fight
before
us
and
that
dan
munro
a
terror
the
only
change
i
can
think
of
is
to
open
out
more
and
fall
back
from
their
goal
for
a
little
while
and
then
if
i
can
hold
dan
cries
of
you
hold
him
all
right
you
are
the
lad
everybody
should
feed
the
master
they
ca
stop
him
any
of
them
but
i
would
say
for
the
first
while
anyway
play
defense
what
do
you
think
sir
appealing
to
the
master
i
call
that
good
tactics
but
do
depend
too
much
upon
me
if
any
man
has
a
chance
for
a
run
and
a
shot
let
him
take
it
and
do
give
up
your
combination
in
your
forward
line
the
captain
is
quite
right
in
seeking
to
draw
them
away
from
their
goal
their
defense
territory
is
too
full
now
now
what
i
have
noticed
is
this
they
mainly
rely
upon
dan
munro
and
upon
their
three
big
defense
men
for
the
first
fifteen
minutes
they
will
make
their
hardest
push
let
us
take
the
advice
fall
back
a
little
and
so
empty
their
defense
but
on
the
whole
keep
your
positions
play
to
your
men
and
he
added
with
a
smile
do
get
too
i
guess
they
will
be
making
some
plans
too
said
thomas
finch
slowly
and
everybody
laughed
that
quite
right
thomas
but
we
give
them
a
chance
for
the
first
while
to
show
us
what
they
mean
to
at
this
point
the
minister
came
in
looking
rather
gloomy
well
craven
rather
doubtful
outlook
is
it
not
o
not
too
bad
sir
said
the
master
cheerfully
three
to
one
what
worse
do
you
want
well
six
to
one
would
be
worse
replied
the
master
besides
their
first
two
games
were
taken
by
a
kind
of
fluke
we
did
know
their
play
you
will
notice
they
have
taken
only
one
in
the
last
of
an
i
doubt
they
are
too
big
for
you
continued
the
minister
is
altogether
size
that
wins
in
shinny
said
craven
hughie
there
is
a
very
big
man
but
he
can
hold
any
one
of
well
i
hope
you
may
be
right
said
the
minister
i
am
sorry
i
have
to
leave
the
game
to
see
a
sick
man
up
kenyon
sorry
you
ca
stay
sir
to
see
us
win
said
craven
cheerfully
while
hughie
slipped
out
to
see
his
mother
before
she
went
well
my
boy
said
his
mother
you
are
playing
a
splendid
game
and
you
are
getting
better
as
you
go
thanks
mother
that
the
kind
of
talk
we
like
said
hughie
who
had
been
a
little
depressed
by
his
father
rather
gloomy
views
awfully
sorry
you
ca
and
so
am
i
but
we
must
go
but
we
shall
be
back
in
time
for
supper
and
you
will
ask
all
the
team
to
come
down
to
celebrate
their
good
for
you
mother
i
tell
them
and
i
bet
they
meantime
the
team
from
the
front
had
been
having
something
of
a
jollification
in
their
quarters
they
were
sure
of
victory
and
in
spite
of
their
captain
remonstrances
had
already
begun
to
pass
round
the
bottle
in
the
way
of
celebration
they
having
something
strong
in
there
said
little
mac
mcgregor
wish
they
pass
some
this
let
them
have
it
said
johnnie
big
duncan
whose
whole
family
ever
since
the
revival
had
taken
a
total
abstinence
pledge
although
this
was
looked
upon
as
a
very
extreme
position
indeed
by
almost
all
the
community
but
big
duncan
campbell
had
learned
by
very
bitter
experience
that
for
him
at
least
there
was
no
safety
in
a
moderate
use
of
good
creature
as
many
of
his
fellow
designated
the
mountain
dew
and
his
sons
had
loyally
backed
him
up
in
this
attitude
quite
right
said
the
master
emphatically
and
if
they
had
any
sense
they
would
know
that
with
every
drink
they
are
throwing
away
a
big
chance
of
horo
you
fellows
shouted
big
hec
ross
across
to
them
are
you
going
to
play
any
more
have
you
got
enough
of
it
already
we
will
not
be
caring
for
any
more
of
yon
kind
said
johnnie
big
duncan
and
we
were
thinking
of
giving
you
a
come
away
and
be
at
it
then
said
hec
for
we
all
getting
that
easily
cured
said
dan
as
they
sallied
forth
to
the
ice
again
for
i
warrant
you
will
not
be
suffering
from
the
cold
in
five
when
the
teams
took
up
their
positions
it
was
discovered
that
dan
had
fallen
back
to
the
center
and
hughie
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
meet
this
new
disposition
of
the
enemy
force
let
them
go
on
said
the
master
with
whom
hughie
was
holding
a
hurried
consultation
you
stick
to
him
and
we
play
defense
till
they
develop
their
the
tactics
of
the
front
became
immediately
apparent
upon
the
drop
of
the
ball
and
proved
to
be
what
the
master
had
foretold
no
sooner
had
the
game
begun
than
the
big
defense
men
advanced
with
the
centers
to
the
attack
and
when
hughie
followed
up
his
plan
of
sticking
closely
to
dan
munro
and
hampering
him
he
found
jimmie
ben
upon
him
swiping
furiously
with
his
club
at
his
shins
with
evident
intention
of
intimidating
him
as
well
as
of
relieving
dan
from
his
attentions
but
if
jimmie
ben
thought
by
his
noisy
shouting
and
furious
swiping
to
strike
terror
to
the
heart
of
the
twentieth
captain
he
entirely
misjudged
his
man
for
without
seeking
to
give
him
back
what
he
received
in
kind
hughie
played
his
game
with
such
skill
and
pluck
that
although
he
was
considerably
battered
about
the
shins
he
was
nevertheless
able
to
prevent
dan
from
making
any
of
his
dangerous
rushes
craven
meantime
if
he
noticed
hughie
hard
case
was
so
fully
occupied
with
the
defense
of
the
goal
that
he
could
give
no
thought
to
anything
else
shot
after
shot
came
in
upon
thomas
at
close
range
and
so
savage
and
reckless
was
the
charge
of
the
front
that
their
big
defense
men
hec
ross
and
jimmie
ben
abandoning
their
own
positions
were
foremost
in
the
melee
before
the
twentieth
goal
for
fully
fifteen
minutes
the
ball
was
kept
in
the
twentieth
territory
and
only
the
steady
coolness
of
craven
and
johnnie
big
duncan
backed
by
hughie
persistent
checking
of
the
front
captain
and
the
magnificent
steadiness
of
thomas
in
goal
saved
the
game
at
length
as
the
fury
of
the
charge
began
to
expend
itself
a
little
craven
got
his
chance
the
ball
had
been
passed
out
to
dan
upon
the
left
wing
of
the
front
forward
line
at
once
hughie
was
upon
him
but
jimmie
ben
following
hard
with
a
cruel
swipe
at
hughie
skates
laid
him
flat
but
not
until
he
had
succeeded
in
hindering
to
some
degree
escape
with
the
ball
before
the
front
captain
could
make
use
of
his
advantage
and
get
clear
away
the
master
bore
down
upon
him
like
a
whirlwind
hurled
him
clear
off
his
feet
secured
the
ball
dashed
up
the
open
field
and
eluding
the
two
centers
who
had
been
instructed
to
cover
the
goal
easily
shot
between
the
for
a
few
moments
the
twentieth
men
went
mad
for
they
all
felt
that
a
crisis
had
been
passed
the
failure
of
the
front
in
what
had
evidently
been
a
preconcerted
and
very
general
attack
was
accepted
as
an
omen
of
victory
the
front
men
on
the
other
hand
were
bitterly
chagrined
they
had
come
so
near
it
and
yet
had
failed
jimmie
ben
was
especially
savage
he
came
down
the
ice
toward
the
center
yelling
defiance
and
threats
of
vengeance
come
on
here
do
waste
time
let
us
at
them
we
knock
them
clear
off
the
it
was
dan
drop
as
he
was
preparing
to
face
off
the
master
skated
up
and
asked
the
umpire
for
time
at
once
the
crowd
gathered
round
what
the
matter
what
up
what
do
you
want
came
on
all
sides
from
the
front
team
now
thoroughly
aroused
and
thirsting
for
vengeance
mr
umpire
said
the
master
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
a
bit
of
foul
play
that
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
and
then
he
described
jimmie
ben
furious
attack
upon
hughie
it
was
a
deliberate
trip
as
well
as
a
savage
swipe
at
a
man
shins
when
the
ball
was
not
at
once
jimmie
ben
gave
him
the
lie
and
throwing
down
his
club
slammed
his
cap
upon
the
ice
and
proceeded
to
execute
a
about
it
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
great
uproar
and
then
the
master
voice
was
heard
again
addressing
the
umpire
i
want
to
know
your
ruling
upon
this
umpire
and
somehow
his
voice
commanded
a
perfect
stillness
well
said
the
umpire
hesitating
of
course
if
a
man
trips
it
is
foul
play
but
i
did
not
see
any
tripping
and
of
course
swiping
at
a
man
shins
is
not
allowed
although
sometimes
it
ca
very
well
be
helped
in
a
i
merely
want
to
call
your
attention
to
it
said
the
master
my
understanding
of
our
arrangements
munro
he
said
addressing
the
front
captain
is
that
we
are
here
to
play
shinny
you
have
come
up
here
i
believe
to
win
the
game
by
playing
shinny
and
we
are
here
to
prevent
you
if
you
have
any
other
purpose
or
if
any
of
your
men
have
any
other
purpose
we
would
be
glad
to
know
it
now
for
we
entered
this
game
with
the
intention
of
playing
straight
clean
that
right
called
out
hec
ross
that
what
we
here
and
his
answer
was
echoed
on
every
side
except
by
jimmie
ben
who
continued
to
bluster
and
offer
fight
o
shut
your
gab
finally
said
farquhar
bheg
impatiently
if
you
want
to
fight
wait
till
after
the
game
is
here
your
cap
jimmie
piped
a
thin
little
voice
you
take
cold
in
your
it
was
little
french
fusie
holding
up
jimmie
cap
on
the
end
of
his
shinny
club
and
smiling
with
the
utmost
good
nature
but
with
infinite
impudence
into
jimmie
face
at
once
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
jimmie
ben
expense
who
with
a
growl
seized
his
cap
and
putting
it
on
his
head
skated
off
to
his
place
now
said
hughie
calling
his
men
together
for
a
moment
let
us
crowd
them
hard
and
let
give
the
master
every
chance
we
no
said
the
master
they
are
waiting
for
me
suppose
you
leave
dan
to
me
for
a
while
you
go
up
and
play
your
forward
combination
they
are
not
paying
so
much
attention
to
you
make
the
attack
from
your
at
the
drop
dan
secured
the
ball
and
followed
by
fusie
flew
up
the
center
with
one
of
the
reds
on
either
hand
immediately
the
master
crossed
to
meet
him
checked
him
hard
and
gave
fusie
a
chance
who
seizing
the
ball
passed
far
up
to
hughie
on
the
right
immediately
the
twentieth
forward
line
rushed
and
by
a
beautiful
hit
of
combined
play
brought
the
ball
directly
before
the
front
goal
when
don
holding
it
for
a
moment
till
hughie
charged
in
upon
farquhar
bheg
shot
and
scored
the
result
of
their
combination
at
once
inspired
the
twentieth
team
with
fresh
confidence
and
proved
most
disconcerting
to
their
opponents
that
the
game
boys
said
the
master
delightedly
keep
your
heads
and
play
your
and
so
well
did
the
forward
line
respond
that
for
the
next
ten
minutes
the
game
was
reduced
to
a
series
of
attacks
upon
the
front
goal
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
dashing
play
of
their
captain
and
the
heavy
checking
of
the
front
defense
the
result
would
have
been
most
disastrous
to
them
meantime
the
twentieth
supporters
lined
along
either
edge
became
more
and
more
vociferous
as
they
began
to
see
that
their
men
were
getting
the
game
well
into
their
own
hands
that
steady
cool
systematic
play
of
man
to
man
was
something
quite
new
to
those
accustomed
to
the
old
style
of
game
and
aroused
the
greatest
enthusiasm
gradually
the
front
were
forced
to
fall
back
into
their
territory
and
to
play
upon
the
defensive
while
the
master
and
johnnie
big
duncan
moving
up
toward
the
center
kept
their
forward
line
so
strongly
supported
and
checked
so
effectually
any
attempts
to
break
through
that
thick
and
fast
the
shots
fell
upon
the
enemy
goal
there
remained
only
fifteen
minutes
to
play
the
hard
pace
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
the
big
men
and
the
inevitable
reaction
following
their
unwise
celebrating
began
to
show
itself
in
their
stale
and
spiritless
play
on
the
other
hand
the
twentieth
were
as
fresh
as
ever
and
pressed
the
game
with
greater
spirit
every
moment
play
out
toward
the
side
urged
dan
despairing
of
victory
but
determined
to
avert
defeat
and
at
every
opportunity
the
ball
was
knocked
out
of
play
but
like
wolves
the
twentieth
forwards
were
upon
the
ball
striving
to
keep
it
in
play
and
steadily
forcing
it
toward
the
enemy
goal
dan
became
desperate
he
was
wet
with
perspiration
and
his
breath
was
coming
in
hard
gasps
he
looked
at
his
team
the
little
reds
were
fit
enough
but
the
others
were
jaded
and
pumped
out
behind
him
stood
jimmie
ben
savage
wet
and
weary
at
one
of
the
pauses
when
the
ball
was
out
of
play
dan
dropped
on
his
knee
hold
on
there
a
minute
he
cried
i
want
to
fix
this
skate
of
very
deliberately
he
removed
his
strap
readjusted
his
skate
and
began
slowly
to
set
the
strap
in
place
again
they
want
a
rest
i
guess
better
take
off
the
time
umpire
sang
out
fusie
dancing
as
lively
as
a
cricket
round
jimmie
ben
who
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
devour
him
bodily
shut
up
fusie
said
hughie
we
got
all
the
time
we
you
have
eh
said
jimmie
ben
savagely
yes
said
hughie
in
sudden
anger
for
he
had
not
forgotten
jimmie
ben
cruel
swipe
we
do
need
any
more
time
than
we
got
and
we
do
need
to
play
any
dirty
tricks
either
we
going
to
beat
you
we
got
you
beaten
blank
your
impudent
face
wait
you
i
show
you
said
jimmie
ben
you
ca
scare
me
jimmie
ben
said
hughie
white
with
rage
you
tried
your
best
and
you
could
do
play
the
game
hughie
said
the
master
in
a
low
tone
skating
round
him
while
hec
ross
said
shut
up
jimmie
ben
need
all
your
wind
for
your
heels
at
which
all
but
jimmie
ben
laughed
for
a
moment
dan
drew
his
men
together
our
only
chance
he
said
is
in
a
rush
now
i
want
every
man
to
make
for
that
goal
never
mind
the
ball
i
get
the
ball
there
and
then
you
jimmie
ben
and
a
couple
of
you
centers
make
right
back
here
on
they
going
to
rush
said
hughie
to
his
team
do
all
go
back
centers
fall
back
with
me
you
forwards
keep
at
the
drop
dan
secured
the
ball
and
in
a
moment
the
front
rush
came
with
a
simultaneous
yell
the
whole
ten
men
came
roaring
down
the
ice
waving
their
clubs
and
flinging
aside
their
lightweight
opponents
it
was
a
dangerous
moment
but
with
a
cry
of
all
steady
boys
hughie
threw
himself
right
into
dan
way
but
just
for
such
a
chance
jimmie
ben
was
watching
and
rushing
upon
hughie
caught
him
fairly
with
his
shoulder
and
hurled
him
to
the
ice
while
the
attacking
line
swept
over
him
for
a
single
moment
hughie
lay
dazed
but
before
any
one
could
offer
help
he
rose
slowly
and
after
a
few
deep
breaths
set
off
for
the
scrimmage
there
was
a
wild
five
minutes
eighteen
or
twenty
men
were
massed
in
front
of
the
twentieth
goal
striking
shoving
yelling
the
solid
weight
of
the
front
defense
forcing
the
ball
ever
nearer
the
goal
in
the
center
of
the
mass
were
craven
johnnie
big
duncan
and
don
fighting
every
inch
for
a
few
moments
hughie
hovered
behind
his
goal
his
heart
full
of
black
rage
waiting
his
chance
at
length
he
saw
an
opening
jimmie
ben
slashing
heavily
regardless
of
injury
to
himself
or
any
others
had
edged
the
ball
toward
the
twentieth
left
taking
a
short
run
hughie
reckless
of
consequences
launched
himself
head
first
into
jimmie
stomach
swiping
viciously
at
the
same
time
at
the
ball
for
a
moment
jimmie
ben
was
flung
back
and
but
for
johnnie
big
duncan
would
have
fallen
but
before
he
could
regain
his
feet
the
ball
was
set
free
of
the
scrimmage
and
away
fusie
rushing
in
had
snapped
it
up
and
had
gone
scuttling
down
the
ice
followed
by
hughie
and
the
master
before
fusie
had
got
much
past
center
dan
who
had
been
playing
in
the
rear
of
the
scrimmage
overtook
him
and
with
a
fierce
body
check
upset
the
little
frenchman
and
secured
the
ball
wheeling
he
saw
both
hughie
and
craven
bearing
down
swiftly
upon
him
rush
for
the
goal
he
shouted
to
jimmie
ben
who
was
following
hughie
hard
jimmie
ben
hesitated
back
to
your
defense
yelled
dan
cutting
across
and
trying
to
escape
between
hughie
and
craven
it
was
in
vain
both
of
the
twentieth
men
fell
upon
him
and
the
master
snatching
the
ball
sped
like
lightning
down
the
ice
the
crowd
went
wild
get
back
get
back
there
screamed
hughie
to
the
mob
crowding
in
upon
the
ice
give
us
room

us
a
show
at
this
moment
craven
cornered
by
hec
ross
and
two
of
the
red
shirts
with
dan
hard
upon
his
heels
passed
clear
across
the
ice
to
hughie
with
a
swift
turn
hughie
caught
the
ball
dodged
jimmie
ben
fierce
spring
at
him
and
shot
but
even
as
he
shot
jimmie
ben
recovering
his
balance
reached
him
and
struck
a
hard
swinging
blow
upon
his
ankle
there
was
a
sharp
crack
and
hughie
fell
to
the
ice
the
ball
went
wide
time
there
umpire
cried
the
master
falling
on
his
knees
beside
hughie
are
you
hurt
hughie
he
asked
eagerly
what
is

my
boy
oh

broken
but

let
them
stop
we
must
win
this
game
we
only
a
few
minutes
take
me
back
to
goal
and
send
thomas
the
eager
hurried
whisper
the
intense
appeal
in
the
white
face
and
dark
eyes
made
the
master
hesitate
in
his
emphatic
refusal
you
ca
oh
do
stop

stop
it
for
me
cried
hughie
gripping
the
master
arm
help
me
up
and
take
me
the
master
swore
a
fierce
oath
we
do
it
my
boy

trump
here
don
he
called
aloud
we
let
hughie
keep
goal
for
a
little
and
they
ran
hughie
back
to
the
goal
on
one
skate
you
go
out
thomas
gasped
hughie
do
talk
we
only
five
they
have
broken
his
leg
said
the
master
with
a
sob
in
his
voice
nothing
wrong
i
hope
said
dan
skating
up
no
play
the
game
said
the
master
fiercely
his
black
eyes
were
burning
with
a
deep
red
glow
is
it
hurting
much
asked
thomas
lingering
about
hughie
oh
you
just
bet
but
do
wait
go
on
go
on
down
you
got
to
get
this
game
thomas
glanced
at
the
foot
hanging
limp
and
then
at
the
white
but
resolute
face
then
saying
with
slow
savage
emphasis
the
brute
beast
as
sure
as
death
i
do
for
him
he
skated
off
to
join
the
forward
line
it
was
the
front
from
goal
there
was
no
plan
of
attack
but
the
twentieth
team
looking
upon
the
faces
of
the
master
and
thomas
needed
no
words
of
command
the
final
round
was
shot
short
sharp
fierce
a
long
drive
from
farquhar
bheg
sent
the
ball
far
up
into
the
twentieth
territory
it
was
a
bad
play
for
it
gave
craven
and
thomas
their
chance
follow
me
close
thomas
cried
the
master
meeting
the
ball
and
setting
off
like
a
whirlwind
past
the
little
reds
through
the
centers
and
into
the
defense
line
he
flashed
followed
hard
by
thomas
in
vain
hec
ross
tried
to
check
craven
was
past
him
like
the
wind
there
remained
only
dan
and
jimmie
ben
a
few
swift
strides
and
the
master
was
almost
within
reach
of
dan
club
with
a
touch
of
the
ball
to
thomas
he
charged
into
his
waiting
foe
flung
him
aside
as
he
might
a
child
and
swept
on
take
the
man
thomas
he
cried
and
thomas
gathering
himself
up
in
two
short
quick
strikes
dashed
hard
upon
jimmie
ben
and
hurled
him
crashing
to
the
ice
take
that
you
brute
you
he
said
and
followed
after
craven
only
farquhar
bheg
was
left
take
no
chances
cried
craven
again
come
on
and
both
of
them
sweeping
in
upon
the
lifted
him
clear
through
the
goal
and
carried
the
ball
with
them
time
called
the
umpire
the
great
game
was
won
then
before
the
crowd
had
realized
what
had
happened
and
before
they
could
pour
in
upon
the
ice
craven
skated
back
toward
jimmie
ben
the
game
is
over
he
said
in
a
low
fierce
tone
you
cowardly
blackguard
you
were
afraid
to
hit
a
boy
now
stand
up
to
a
man
if
you
jimmie
ben
was
no
coward
dropping
his
club
he
came
eagerly
forward
but
no
sooner
had
he
got
well
ready
than
craven
struck
him
fair
in
the
face
and
before
he
could
fall
caught
him
with
a
straight
swift
blow
on
the
chin
and
lifting
him
clear
off
his
skates
landed
him
back
on
his
head
and
shoulders
on
the
ice
where
he
lay
with
his
toes
quivering
serve
him
right
said
hec
ross
there
was
no
more
of
it
the
twentieth
crowds
went
wild
with
joy
and
rage
for
their
great
game
was
won
and
the
news
of
what
had
befallen
their
captain
had
got
round
he
took
his
city
though
murray
said
the
master
after
the
great
supper
in
the
manse
that
evening
as
hughie
lay
upon
the
sofa
pale
suffering
but
happy
and
not
only
one
but
a
whole
continent
of
them
and
he
added
the
game
as
with
sudden
tears
and
a
little
break
in
her
voice
the
mother
said
looking
at
her
boy
it
was
worth
while
taking
the
city
but
i
fear
the
game
cost
too
oh
pshaw
mother
said
hughie
it
only
one
bone
and
i
tell
you
that
final
round
was
worth
a
chapter
xv
the
result
how
many
did
you
say
craven
of
those
glengarry
men
of
yours
professor
gray
was
catechizing
his
nephew
ten
of
them
sir
besides
the
minister
son
who
is
going
to
take
the
full
university
and
all
of
them
bound
for
the
ministry
so
they
say
and
judging
by
the
way
they
take
life
and
the
way
for
instance
they
play
shinny
i
have
a
notion
they
will
see
it
they
come
of
a
race
that
sees
things
through
answered
the
professor
and
this
is
the
result
of
this
zion
hill
academy
i
have
been
hearing
so
much
about
well
sir
they
put
in
a
good
year
work
i
must
you
might
have
done
worse
sir
indeed
you
deserve
great
credit
i
not
a
bit
i
simply
showed
them
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
but
there
a
woman
up
there
that
the
world
ought
to
know
about
for
love
of
her
oh
the
world
snorted
the
professor
the
world
sir
the
lord
deliver
us
it
might
do
the
world
some
good
i
it
is
for
love
of
her
these
men
are
in
for
the
you
are
wrong
sir
that
is
not
their
no
perhaps
it
is
not
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
so
but
yet
she
i
know
sir
i
know
sir
bless
my
soul
sir
i
know
her
i
knew
her
before
you
were
born
but
yes
yes
the
professor
spoke
as
if
to
himself
for
love
of
her
men
would
attempt
great
things
you
have
these
names
craven
ah
alexander
stewart
donald
cameron
thomas
finch
finch
let
me
see
ah
yes
finch
his
mother
died
after
a
long
illness
yes
i
remember
a
very
sad
case
a
very
sad
case
and
yet
not
so
sad
sir
put
in
craven
at
any
rate
it
did
not
seem
so
at
the
time
that
night
it
seemed
anything
but
sad
it
was
the
professor
laid
down
his
list
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
go
on
sir
he
said
gazing
curiously
at
craven
i
have
heard
a
little
about
it
let
me
see
it
was
the
night
of
the
great
match
was
it
not
did
you
know
about
that
who
told
you
about
the
match
sir
i
hear
a
great
many
things
and
in
curious
ways
but
go
on
sir
go
craven
sat
silent
and
from
the
look
in
his
eyes
his
thoughts
were
far
away
well
sir
it
a
thing
i
have
never
spoken
about
it
seems
to
me
if
i
may
say
so
something
quite
too
sacred
to
speak
of
again
craven
paused
while
the
professor
waited
it
was
hughie
sent
me
there
there
was
a
jubilation
supper
at
the
manse
you
understand
thomas
finch
the
you
know
magnificent
fellow
too
was
not
at
the
supper
a
messenger
had
come
for
him
saying
that
his
mother
had
taken
a
bad
turn
hughie
was
much
disappointed
and
they
were
all
evidently
anxious
i
offered
to
drive
over
and
inquire
and
of
course
the
minister
wife
though
she
had
been
on
the
go
all
day
long
must
needs
go
with
me
i
can
never
forget
that
night
i
suppose
you
have
noticed
sir
there
are
times
when
one
is
more
sensitive
to
impressions
from
one
surroundings
than
others
there
are
times
with
me
too
when
i
seem
to
have
a
very
vital
kinship
with
nature
at
any
rate
during
that
drive
nature
seemed
to
get
close
to
me
the
dark
still
forest
the
crisp
air
the
frost
sparkling
in
the
starlight
on
the
trees
it
all
seemed
to
be
part
of
me
i
fear
i
am
not
explaining
craven
paused
again
and
his
eyes
began
to
glow
the
professor
still
waited
when
we
reached
the
house
we
found
them
waiting
for
death
the
minister
wife
went
in
i
waited
in
the
kitchen
by
and
by
billy
jack
that
her
eldest
son
you
know
came
out
is
asking
for
you
he
said
and
i
went
in
i
had
often
seen
her
before
and
i
rather
think
she
liked
me
you
see
i
had
been
able
to
help
thomas
along
pretty
well
both
in
school
and
with
his
night
work
and
she
was
grateful
for
what
i
had
done
absurdly
grateful
when
one
considers
how
little
it
was
i
had
seen
death
before
and
it
had
always
been
ghastly
but
there
was
nothing
ghastly
in
death
that
night
the
whole
scene
is
before
me
now
i
suppose
always
will
his
dead
black
eyes
were
beginning
to
show
their
deep
red
fire
the
professor
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
said
proceed
if
you
please
and
craven
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
recalling
himself
and
went
on
the
old
man
was
there
at
one
side
with
his
gray
head
down
on
the
bed
his
little
girl
kneeling
beside
him
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
opposite
him
the
minister
wife
her
face
calm
and
steady
billy
jack
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
and
little
jessac
the
only
ones
in
the
room
who
were
weeping
and
there
at
the
head
thomas
supporting
his
mother
now
and
then
moistening
her
lips
and
giving
her
sips
of
stimulant
and
so
quick
and
steady
gentle
as
a
woman
and
smiling
through
it
all
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
the
same
big
fellow
who
three
hours
before
had
carried
the
ball
through
the
front
defense
i
tell
you
sir
it
was
wonderful
there
was
no
fuss
or
hysterical
nonsense
in
that
room
the
mother
lay
there
quite
peaceful
pain
all
gone
and
she
had
had
enough
of
it
in
her
day
she
was
quite
a
beautiful
woman
too
in
a
way
fine
eyes
remarkable
eyes
splendidly
firm
mouth
showing
great
nerve
i
should
say
all
her
life
i
understand
she
lived
for
others
and
even
now
her
thought
was
not
of
herself
when
i
came
in
she
opened
her
eyes
they
were
like
stars
actually
shining
and
her
smile
was
like
the
sudden
breaking
of
light
through
a
cloud
she
put
out
her
hand
for
mine
and
said
and
i
value
these
words
sir
craven
i
give
you
a
thanks
and
a
mither
blessing
for
a
you
have
done
for
ma
laddie
she
was
lowland
scotch
you
know
my
voice
went
all
to
pieces
i
tried
to
say
it
was
nothing
but
stuck
thomas
helped
me
out
and
without
a
shake
or
quiver
in
his
voice
he
answered
for
me
indeed
mother
we
not
forget
it
perhaps
you
can
help
him
a
bit
still
he
will
be
needing
it
she
added
i
assure
you
sir
that
quiet
steadiness
of
thomas
and
herself
braced
me
up
and
i
was
able
to
make
my
promise
and
then
she
said
with
a
look
that
somehow
reminded
me
of
the
deep
starlit
night
outside
through
which
i
had
just
come
you
craven
you
will
give
your
life
to
god
again
my
voice
failed
me
it
was
so
unexpected
and
quite
overwhelming
once
more
thomas
answered
for
me
mother
he
will
sure
and
she
seemed
to
take
it
as
my
promise
for
she
smiled
again
at
me
and
closed
her
eyes
i
had
read
of
triumphant
scenes
and
all
that
before
without
taking
much
stock
in
them
but
believe
me
sir
that
room
was
full
of
glory
the
very
faces
of
those
people
it
seemed
to
me
were
alight
it
may
be
imagination
but
even
now
as
i
think
of
it
it
seems
real
there
were
no
farewells
no
wailing
and
at
the
very
last
not
even
tears
thomas
who
had
nursed
her
for
more
than
a
year
still
supported
her
the
smile
on
his
face
to
the
end
and
the
end
craven
voice
grew
unsteady
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
the
minister
wife
repeated
the
words
about
the
house
with
many
mansions
and
those
about
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
said
a
little
prayer
and
then
we
all
waited
for
the
end
for
myself
i
confess
with
considerable
fear
and
anxiety
i
had
no
need
to
fear
after
a
long
silence
she
sat
up
straight
and
in
her
scotch
tongue
she
said
with
a
kind
of
amazed
joy
in
her
tone
fayther
ma
fayther
i
am
here
then
she
settled
herself
back
in
her
son
arms
drew
a
deep
breath
and
was
still
all
through
the
night
and
next
day
the
glory
lingered
round
me
i
went
about
as
in
a
strange
world
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
thinking
me
foolish
the
stern
old
professor
was
openly
wiping
his
eyes
he
seemed
quite
unable
to
find
his
voice
at
length
he
took
up
the
list
again
and
began
to
read
it
mechanically
what
what
this
he
said
suddenly
pointing
to
a
name
on
the
list
that
sir
is
john
do
you
mean
that
you
too
yes
i
mean
it
if
you
think
i
am
fit
jack
my
boy
none
of
us
are
fit
but
what
how
did
this
come
the
professor
blew
his
nose
like
a
trumpet
that
i
can
hardly
tell
myself
said
craven
with
a
kind
of
wonder
in
his
voice
but
at
any
rate
it
is
the
result
of
my
glengarry
school
days
